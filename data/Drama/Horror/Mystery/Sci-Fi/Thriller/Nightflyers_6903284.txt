FADE IN:
INT. AVALON SPACEPORT TERMINAL; CONCOURSE - NIGHT

We are moving rapidiy down a narrow, dimly lit tunnel ina
silent, bubble-topped shuttle vehicle. There is no driver.

Seated in the left front seat is MIRANDA DORLAC, an
extraordinarily beautiful, athletically-built young woman
wearing a yellow flight suit. Patches identify her as a
member of the "Volcryn Expedition" from Avalon University.

To Miranda's right is VLADIMIR D'BRANIN, the expedition
leader. A tall, gaunt man in his early forties, D'Branin is
typing rapidly into a portable computer.

Miranda glances behind her where we see AUDREY ZALE, LILLY
KENT, DARRYL FONTAINE, and OWL KEELOR, all of them wearing
Voicryn Expedition flight suits. Audrey is an intense-
looking brunette in her late 20's. Lilly is a pudgy 30 year
old brunette, Darryl is a compact, slightly effeminate man
in his late 30's. Owl is a good-looking former jock, who
iooks ten years clder than his 27 years.

Miranda locks back at D'Branin and smiles, seeing he's still
typing into his computer at a furious pace.

CLOSE ON THE COMPUTER DISPLAY - The screen shows a projected
flight path for a ship called "The Nightflyer", headed for a
rendezvous with a something called the Volcryn, represented by
a blinking yellow symbol. At the bottom of the screen the

time and date are displayed:

4:46 A.M. 6/26/2087 Avaion University
A bell tone is heard and the shuttle pulls to a rapid stop.
It turns to the right, then rises upwards. Light begins
shining down through the tinted glass bubble.

INT. HANGAR (MINIATURE) ~ NIGHT

The shuttle can be seen rising up from the tunnel into an
enormous hangar.
INT. SHUTTLE; (IN HANGAR) - NIGHT

Each of the team members react strongly to the sight that
awaits them there.

THEIR POV: (THROUGH SHUTTLE WINDOW) - "THE NICGHTFLYER" is a
a ochre-colored cargo vessel, with three spherical holds and
muscular, backswept wings that give it the appearance of
some kind of prehistoric beast. The ship is beautiful, in
the way certain spiders are beautiful.

Great clouds of steam issue from it's tail section. Its
engines generate a powerful, throbbing noise, as if an alien
factory were operating deep within its boweis.

INT. SHUTTLE - NIGHT

The glass bubble rises with a soft hiss. D'Branin hurriedly
puts his computer into his flight bag and gets out, as do
the others. Owl takes a flask from his flight suit and
knocks back a quick drink before joining them.

INT. HANGAR - NIGHT

The shuttle's bubble top closes and the vehicle descends
back into the tunnel. The team walk closer to the Nightfiyer.

LILLY
It's beautiful...

OWL
If you're into dinosaurs. It looks
60 years old...

MIRANDA
It's a lot older than that.

D'BRANIN
It's an excellent ship.
AUDREY
Even if it it was the only one we
could afford, right?

D'Branin looks at her sharply, but he doesn't deny it. Owl
whispers to Audrey:

own
I'd feel better if we were taking
ene of the University's garbage rigs
than whatever the hell that is...

Miranda is standing too far away for a normal person to have
heard him, but she fills in the biank:

MIRANDA
It's a Celidian 9000... One of
the Quark Thrusters series.

Owl and Audrey look at her, wondering...

ANGLE ON THE NIGHTFLYER - The ship's running lights come on,
revealing contours and textures that give the ship's metal
skin an almost reptilian quality.

CLOSE ON MIRANDA ~ She regards the ship with respect.

They are all startled by a loud HISSING noise, as an airlock
near the front of the ship slides open, and a boarding ramp
is lowered to the ground.

D'Branin hesitates, looking around as if waiting for someone
to arrive. He turns to Miranda.

D'BRANIN
This is where we were to meet Jon
and Dr. Scott.

He checks his watch and looks in both directions. There is
no sign of their approach.

MIRANDA
They may already be on the ship.
D'Branin nods. His mind is already on the exnedition, and he
heads for the boarding ramp, oblivious to the others.

Miranda turns back to the team, smiling encouragingly.

MIRANDA
Let's go.

ANGLE ON D'BRANIN - He mounts the ramp. Miranda follows
closely behind, and then the others.

THEIR POV - The ramp leads up into the dark oval opening.

CLOSE ON THE PORTAL - At the top of the opening, we see a
hidden video camera aimed downward.

INT. NIGHTFLYER; ROYD'S CABIN ~ NIGHT

In the center of the command console, a large oval-shaped
monitor shows a point of view of D'Branin and the others
following him up the ramp. The picture zooms in on Miranda's
face until it fills the screen.

INT. NIGHTFLYER; MAIN CORRIDOR - NIGHT

D'Branin and Miranda step ineide. The reat of the crew
tentatively follow them through.

THEIR POV ~ Like the exterior cf the ship, the interior
suggests a fusion between machine and animal. The dimly-lit
corridor is furnished in a biend of rich~looking fabrics and
rough-textured, overlapping metal plates.

There is a feeling of great age to everything, as if it were
an immaculately kept exhibit in a museun.

ANGLE ON MIRANDA - Miranda goes to the wall, touching the
strangely textured fabric. She looks at her teammates.

ANGLE ON AUDREY - She walks over to examine a painting
hanging on the wall.
INSERT: THE PAINTING - It suggests Munch's “The Scream",
painted by a highly disturbed alien. :

Darryl puts a hand on Audrey's shoulder and she jumps.

DARRYL
Sorry. Admiring the art work?

AUDREY
I guess that's what it is.

They walk away, not noticing that the figure in the painting
moves, ever so slightly, as if it had a life of its own.
D'Branin calls out:

D'BRANIN
Royd... Captain...

A soft, androgynous-sounding voice comes over the com
system.

ROYD (V.0.)
T am here, Dr. D'Branin. Welcome to
the Nightfiyer. I apologize for not
being able to greet you and your
crew in a more personable fashion...

Everyone looks around for the source of this voice.
ROYD (V.0.)
---but Iam presently occupied ina

manner which prevents this.

CLOSE ON MIRANDA - She notices something up near the ceiling
and we follows her gaze.

HER POV; A tiny video camera pans in their direction.
Miranda looks at D'Branin, nervously glancing at his watch.
D'BRANIN

Captain, there are two other members
of our team who were to meet us here...
ROYD (V.0.)
You were the first to arrive.

ROYD (V.0.)
As we are scheduled to take off in
less than an hour, there is a great
deal I must attend to. I'li join you
in the lounge, after takeoff.

D'BRANIN
Thank you.

He gestures for the team to follow him, down the hall toward
the lounge. They look at one another, wondering what they've
gotten themselves into.°

INT. ROYD'S CABIN - NIGHT

CLOSE ON THE OVAL MONITOR - We see the team approaching the
entrance to the lounge. An adjacent monitor shows a view of
the hangar where we see another bubbled-topped vehicie
rising up out of the hangar floor, in the same place our
team arrived. Two figures emerge from the vehicle.

INT. HANGAR - NIGHT

CLOSE ON JON WINDERMAN - Good-looking, in his early 20's, Jon
is an unsettling mixture of wholesomeness and degeneracy.

Standing beside him is DR. ELIZA SCOTT, a very pretty, red-
haired woman of about 30. She is Jon's personal physician
and companion: his "psypsych.”

They pick up their flight bags and we move with them, as
they begins walking toward the ship.

We begin to hear a rhythmic, RUSHING noise, which continues
as they approach the ship.

CLOSE ON JON - He stares at the ship then turns to Eliza, as
if unwilling to trust his impressions.
CLOSE ON ELIZA ~ She is also studying the Nightfiyer, then
she turns to Jon.

JON'S POV: ELIZA - We can hear her speak, although she isn't
moving her lips:

ELIZA (V.0.)
Are you getting anything cff of it...?

Jon pauses, smiling a strange, fractured smile. He answers
her telepathically:

JON (V.0.)
Nothing... worth mentioning.

Eliza looks worried. Jon looks over at the ship again and
smiles with more assurance.

JON
Honest.

Eliza leoks dubious. She walks ahead of hin, stepping up on
to the boarding ramp. Jon locks up at the ship for a moment,
then follows her.

INT. LOUNGE - NIGHT

The room serves as the main living/dining space for the
ship. Wine-colored, oddiy textured fabric lining the walis
and alien-styled furniture give this room a strange,
medieval quality. One wall leads te the galley. The opposite
wall is a giant video monitor which provides a view from the
camera on the nose of the ship.

The team is seated an the oval-shaped table, making pre-
flight preparations

ANGLE ON D'BRANIN ~- Looking extremely tense, he glances at
his portable computer, then addresses the team:
D'BRANIN
According to the latest
transmissions from Avalon, the
Volcryn are maintaining the plotted
flight path.

D'Branin turns to Mixexia, who continues.

MIRANDA
We should reach the rendezvous point
in eight days. Then we'll have a ten
day window, during which they'll
make their appearance. Hopefully.

D'Branin looks at the team as if somehow trying to convey
his excitement about the expedition to them.

D'BRANIN
in spite of all our research, there
is no way to anticipate what we will
actually encounter when we meet...

As he is speaking, the door to the lounge opens silently
behind him, revealing Jon and Eliza.

D'BRANIN (Continued)
«what remains as one of the oldest
mysteries of the universe...

D'BRANIN'S POV - Everyone in the room, stares in his
direction. (in actuality at Jon and Eliza.)

D'Branin realizes that the team is not looking at him. He
turns around to see Jon and Eliza.

D'BRANIN (V.0.)
Thank God, they made itt...
Everything is falling inte place..
CLOSE ON JON - he scans the people seated around the table.

JON'S POV ~ Time seems to nearly stop, as D'Branin rises,
and walks slowly over to greet them.
D'BRANIN
I'd like all of you meet the final
two members of our team. We're most
fortunate to have Jon Winderman, one
of the University's six certified
class 10 telepaths... and Doctor
Elizabeth Scott, Jon's personal
physician and a class three in her
own right.

Meanwhile, from John's POV we see the team and hear their
thoughts; sometimes clearly and sometimes overlapping:

AUDREY (V.0.)
Oh. he's gorgeous.... But I can't
stand the bitch with hin...
Shit! He's reading my...

OWL (V.0.)
Certified..? Or did he say,
certifiable? The higher the rating,
the more unstable they are...

DARRYL (V.0.)
If you're reading this, Jon... I
just want you to know I think you're
a wonderful human being...

LILLY (V.0.)
If we miscalculate plus or minus one
half of a percentage with the
Volcryn flight path, we should still
be within... Why is everyone so ...?

When Jon reaches Miranda's face, there is absolute silence.

CLOSE ON JON: ~ He starts to look away, but comes back again,
as if something was wrong.

CLOSE ON MIRANDA - She looks at directly at Jon, her
expression perfectly blank.

HER POV; CLOSE ON JON - He continues to stare at Miranda as
4f extremely puzzied.
HIS POV: CLOSE ON MIRANDA - She smiles ever so slightly.
Although she doesn't move her lips, we can hear her whisper:

MIRANDA (V.0.}
Just a littie trick I learned...

CLOSE ON JON - He smiles at her, impressed.

JON (V.0.}
I have a few of my own you might
like.

CLOSE ON ELIZA —- She watches and listens in-on this
"conversation" between Jon and Miranda.

BACK TO SCENE - Jon turns around as D'Branin finally
reaches him, extending his hand at normal speed.

D'BRANIN
Jon... Eliza... Please sit down.

Improptu greetings are exchanged around the room, as Eliza
and Jon take their seats.

Royd's soft voice can be heard over the com system:

ROYD (V.0.)
Prepare for takeoff.

The room lights dim slightly. While D'Branin continues his
his orientation speech to Jon and Eliza.

D'BRANIN
We've been approaching the task of
establishing communication from
every possible avenue.

CLOSE ON THE WALL SCREEN ~ It offers a view of the hangar as
the door begin to slide open.

wer

INT. ROYD'S CABIN - NIGHT

The large oval monitor shows the jlounge where D'Branin
can be seen speaking to Jon and Eliza:

A silver-gloved hand picks up an intricately carved
lightpen, aiming it an icon on the control panel
representing a fusion generator. As the pen flashes, the
icon glows a golden color. A faint rumble is heard from
somewhere deep within the ship.

INT. LOUNGE ~ NIGET

The chairs around the oval table automatically lower into
horizontal positions as D'Branin finishes his speech:

D'BRANIN
In the end, your talents may prove
to be successful where our machines
fail.: Only time will tell...
The team glance at one another, reacting to the oddness of
taking off into deep space, in a strange ship, with a
captain they have yet to see in person.

CLOSE ON THE WALL-SIZED MONITOR ~ It shows a spectacular
view of space through the now-open hangar doors.

Smoothly, almost silently, the ship passes through the
hangar, ewiftly building up speed as it leaves Avalon.

EXT. AVALON SPACEPORT (MINIATURES) - NIGHT

The Nightfiyer recedes into the darkness of space.
INT. NIGHTFLYER; LOUNGE - NIGHT

The sound of the Nightflyer's engines reaches a high-pitched
whine and a strong vibration passes through the ship.

41
CLOSE ON THE WALL MONITOR - The view from space changes
dramatically as we approach the speed of light: our field of
vision blurs, flattening out into a lustrous, deep blue
radiance.

BACK TO SCENE - The chairs rise into upright positions and
the team unstrap themselves. Now that they've actually
taken off, D'Branin relaxes a little. Ee looks around at the
ship like a little kid who's gotten control of a toy store.

ROYD (V.0.)
The Nightflyer has locked into star
@rive. You're all free to move
about the ship.

Miranda quietly asks Lilly:

MIRANDA
How long before we can switch to on-
board tracking?

LILLY
As soon as we drop out of drive.

D'BRANIN
And the transmitter?

LILLY
We should be able to test it out by
tomorrow afternoon.

D'BRANIN
Excellent.

He turns to Audrey who's nervously chewing on her
fingernaiis in anticipation of his question.

D'BRANIN

And what is the projection for
decoding the Voleryn disc.

12
AUDREY
“@ I've run it through every known _
. decryption algorythm. There's just
no internal logic to the signais...
Look, Viadimir, I got the disk less
than a month ago. You can't expect
miracles,

D'Branin is silent for a moment. Then he addresses Audrey
Slowly, carefully and with a distinct edge to his voice:

D'BRANIN
I don't expect miracies. But I
expect that by the time, we drop out
of drive, you will have achieved
some kind of breakthrough that will
enable us to begin to understand and
communicate with these creatures
when we meet them.

7%

Audrey is silent, obviously not sharing his optimism. She
. @ exchanges glances with Lilly:

- AUDREY
We're working on a self-modifying
transmission pattern... as a
backup.

D'BRANIN
I see. Perhaps you ought to turn the
@isc over to Jon... as a backup.

AUDREY
That's not fair, Vladimir! I'm doing
everything I...

JON
I don't think it's a good idea.

Everyone turns to Jon, including Eliza who glares at hin,
speaking telepathically:

@ ELIZA (V.0.}
What the hell are you...?

13
e Jon ignores her, addressing D'Branin:

Mee JON
I don't want anything that could
confuse the signals I'm picking up.

D'BRANIN
What signals?

Eliza speaks calmly, attempting to dilute the anxiety:

ELIZA
He's a universal conductor. You have
no idea how much cosmic garbage
comes through hin.
(smiling at Miranda)
Anything of significance will
develop into a pattern.

ot

JON

It has...
-@

Everyone turns to him again.

JON
I just can't put it into words yet.

Eliza hides her distress, speaking to Jon telepathically:

ELIZA (V.0.)
What the hell are you doing?

D'BRANIN
The Voleryn?

JON
I don't think so...

Just then, an intense beam of red light shines down from the

ceiling. ROYD ERRIS, the captain of the Nightflyer

materializes in the chair opposite D'Branin, in the form of
@ a shimmering, holographic projection.

14
The holograph is a handsome, pale-eyed young man with short,
copper-colored hair. He wears grey, metal- flaked clothes
that wrap loosely around his body.

ROYD'S BOLO
I apologize for my tardiness but it
was unavoidable.

ANGLE ON OWL AND AUDREY - He whispers to her:

. OWL
Is this some Kind of joke?

AUDREY
Shhhhhh.

Miranda and D'Branin exchange glances. D'Branin is as
perplexed as the others, but he tries to appear nonchalant.

D'Branin glances up at the ceiling where the holographic
Projector is hidden, and then back at the ghostly figure
sitting opposite hin.

D'BRANIN
Ah... How shall I phrase this..?

ROYD'S HOLO
You're curious about my present
form...

D'Branin nods his head.
CLOSE ON ROYD'S HOLOGRAPH ~ A smile forms on his lips.

ROYD'S HOLO
I find that on the Nightfiyer, there
is always a great deal of work to
be done, and only a finite amount of
time in which to do it. By sending
out my holograph, Iam, ina manner
of speaking, able to be in two
places at once... No disrespect is
intended.

is
The team exchange glances in reaction to this. D'Branin
however, acts as if he's satisfied with Royd's explanation.

D'BRANIN
None taken... I'd like to introduce
you to my team...

ANGLE ON OWL - He whispers to Lilly:

OWL
This is the wierdest fucking thing
I've ever seen...

LILLY
(whispering to Audrey)
Look at him. It's like he's looking
right through you.

oe

AUDREY
What do you expect from a holograph,
eye contact?

” @ CLOSE ON THE HOLOGRAPH - His unseeing eyes seem focused on
Miranda.

D'Branin turns to her.

D'BRANIN
Royd Erris, this is...

ROYD'S HOLO
Forgive me for interrupting,
but I have aterrible memory for
names.

Miranda smiles. Apparently she is the only one who finds
this amusing. .

ROYD'S HOLO
There will be more than enough time,

for all of us to become acquainted...

e He seems distracted by something across the table.

16
ANGLE ON JON AND ELIZA ~ Eliza sees that Jon is staring off
into space, with a pained look in his eyes. She takes his
hand, whispering telepathically. .

ELIZA (V.0.)
What are you feeling?

A fine sweat breaks out on Jon's face.

ELIZA (V.0.)
Talk to me, dammit!

CLOSE ON JON - The veins on his neck swell and throb
visibly. We hear the rushing sound which we heard earlier,
when he first saw the ship. He speaks aloud:

JON
Pressure.

Everyone in the room turns to him.

D'BRANIN
What was that?

ELIZA
QUIET! Please....

CLOSE ON JON - He holds his head as the pressure increases.
The RUSHING sound grows progressively louder.

CLOSE ON MIRANDA - She looks from Jon to Royd's holograph.

HER POV: A look of concern comes into the holograph's face.

INT. ROYD'S CABIN - NIGHT

The conference table is featured in the master console.
The camera zooms in until Jon's face fills the screen. He
ljooks terrified.

The silver gloved hand quickly picks up the lightpen,
flashing it at the oval monitor. The screen goes black.

i7
INT. LOUNGE - NIGHT

CLOSE ON JON - A shudder passes through his body, then he
relaxes. .

JON
It's gone.

The other members of the project stare at him. And then at
Royd's holograph, which has remained in his chair seat at
the head of the table, throughout this incident.

Eliza looks closely into Jon's eyes, speaking aloud:

ELIZA
Are you okay?

CLOSE ON JON ~ He nods his head, but telepathically we hear:

: JON (V.0.}
No... I'm not!

CLOSE ON ELIZA ~- She covers her concern, asking aloud:

ELIZA
Can you talk about what you felt?

Jon is having trouble maintaining his self-composure. He
answers telepathically.

JON {(V.0.)
No! Please get me out of here!

The crew look at one another uneasily. Eliza smiles,
addressing them in a calm, deliberate manner.

ELIZA
There's nothing to be concerned
about. I'm afraid Jon is a little
oversensitive from his last
expedition and he needs some time to
adjust to the ship. I'm going to
take him back to our cabin, to rest.

18
Ah

She starts to help Jon to his feet, but he manages on his
own. The door opens and they leave. The team members glance
uncemfortably at one another and then at the holograph,
still seated at the head of the table.

ROYD'S HOLO
I'm sure you all have work to attend
to, as I do, so I will bid you
goodnight.

D'BRANIN
Very well, Captain. Goodnight.

The holograph disappears. D'’Branin pauses a moment, and then
acting as if nothing unusual had happened, glances at his
flight intinerary. He resumes where he left off earlier:

D'BRANIN
As soon as we drop cut of drive,
we're going to need a complete
spectral analysis of the entire
targeted area which the Volcryn are
due to pass through. Owl...

Owl looks from D'Branin up to the recessed holographic
projector in the ceiling.

OWL
Complete spectral analysis... No
problen.

The rest of the team look questioningly at each other and
then at D'Branin,.

FADE TO:
INT. JON AND ELIZA'S CABIN; - NIGHT

Eliza opens the door and helps Jon over to his bed. He lies
down, and she sits beside him.

ELIZA
Can't you control yourself?

19
We hear the RUSHING sound, which grows louder as we move in
closer to Jon. He turns back to stare up at the ceiling.

ELIZA
You can't do this to me again!

HIS POV ~ For a brief flash, the wall covering of the room
seems to burn away, revealing a network of veins carrying a
pulsing, vermilion-colored liquid throughout the ship.

 

ELIZA (V.0.)
Jon...

BACK TO SCENE ~ Eliza sees that he's gone into a trance. She
checks his eyes, breathing, and pulse. Opening up her
medical kit, she take out a hypodermic gun and loads ina
vial containing a purple liquid. Eliza places the gun
against Jon's neck and pulls the trigger. He begins to relax
almost immediately. Eliza watches him a moment, then sits
down beside him, stroking his forehead.

INT. ROYD'S CABIN ~ NIGHT

We see the same image on the oval monitor cf Royd's console.
FADE TO:

INT. CARGO BAY #1 - NIGHT

Audrey and Lilly are unpacking the last of the computer
and communication equipment, setting it up against the
false wall of the bay. They pause to catch their breath.

AUDREY
We're stuck here in a cargo bay, on
a ship captained by a holographic
projection, flying with an unstable
telepath, on a mission to establish
communication with the most alien
life form in the universe...

20
LILLY
eo It's perfect.

She starts running some tests on the tracking system while
Audrey enters commands via a keyboard.

AUDREY
The ship doesn't seem to have any
crew, except for Royd, right?

LILLY
We'd have no way of knowing... but
for the sake of argument...

AUDREY

os

Why not complete automation?

LILLY
No reason I can think of.

. AUDREY
@ I bet Royd Erris doesn't even
exist... I bet that holograph is
just a a sophisticated artificial
intelligence.

LILLY
It'd have to awfully sophisticated,
df it's just a program

AUDREY
We'll find out, one way or the
other. .
LILLY

Don't you think there's something
else you should find out, first?

AUDREY
What?

@ Lilly switches on a small disc player and we hear a series
of arythmic, wave-like sounds. Audrey shuts the disc.

24
AUDREY
Please. I've already memorized it. I
go to sleep with it... I dream about
the Volcryn disc... It's become the
single most irritating sound in my
entire life.

LIGLY
Maybe you should let Jon listen to it.

AUDREY
No way! Besides he said it would confuse
him... I'll figure the damn thing
out myself... Although I wouldn't
mind working with hin.

Lilly makes an adjustment on the transmitter and it begins
emitting a high-pitched squelch.

LILLY
Pardon?

AUDREY
Nothing.

She puts on a pair of headphones and sets to work once again
on the dreaded Volcryn disc.

INT. ROYD'S CABIN - NIGHT

CLOSE ON THE OVAL MONITOR - We move back to reveal this
scene being watched on the large screen. The other screens
show the rest of the team in their separate quarters.

The silver-gloved hand flashes the lightpen, changing the
image on the oval monitor to D'Branin'’s cabin.

ON THE OVAL MONITOR - D'Branin is seated at his desk speaking
into a microphone attached to his portable computer. The
visuals on the screen range from cave drawings to computer-
generated images.

22
D'BRANIN
When Jesus of Nazareth hung dying on

-@ his cress, the Volcryn passed within
a@ light~year of his agony, headed
outward.

The image switches to Cargo bay #2, where Owl is working on
a small hydrepenic garden. Behind him, a makeshift
biological laboratory complete with some sort of robotic,
surgical/scanner device has already been set up.

D'Branin's narration continues ;

D'BRANIN (0.S.}
When the fire wars raged on Earth,
the Volcryn sailed near Old
Poseidon, where the seas were still
unnamed and unfinished.

The image changes to the small private cabin where we see
Eliza attaching some sort of monitoring device to Jon's
forehead, while he lies asleep.

a @ D'BRANIN (0.S.)
When Kleronomas the Great tock his
survey ship out in search of new
treasures, he came within ten light
years of the Volcryn. Kleronomas
found many things, but he did not
find the Voleryn...

The image switches to Darryl in the galley, loading the
team's supplies into their respective places.

D'BRANIN (0.S.)}
When I was a childof three,
Kleronomas the Great was dust, as
distant and dead as Jesus of
Nazareth, the Volcryn passed close
to Daronne.

The image changes to a corridor where Miranda is walking

to Jon and Eliza's cabin. The door opens and Eliza stands
e protectively blocking the entranceway.

23
Miranda asks something about Jon, which Eliza answers with
sone irritation. But then she says something else which
makes Eliza laugh and she looks less threatened by Miranda.
The door closes.

INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE JON AND ELIZA'S CABIN - NIGHT
CLOSE ON MIRANDA - As she walks away, she senses the camera
up on the wall silently panning to follow her.
INT. ROYD'S CABIN - NIGHT
Miranda's image grows on the oval screen as she approaches.
We sense Royd's growing fascination with this beautiful
woman, It becomes even more apparent as the lightpen
flashes, freezing her in space, before returning to
D'Branin's cabin, as he completes his report on the Voleryn.
. D'BRANIN (0.S.)

When I was grown, the Volcryn sailed

beyond the galaxy of Tara, past the

range of even the Crey, still

heading outward....

He stares at a color picture up on his wall of a beautiful
spiral nebulae. We move in until it fills the screen.

DISSOLVE To:
EXT. NIGHTFLYER ~ HYPERSPACE - NIGHT

The ship is a blur of light as it streams through space at
stardrive speed.

FADE TO:
INT. ROYD'S CABIN - EARLY MORNING

The bank of monitors show show the rose-colored lights of
artificial dawn begin to come up slowly around the ship.

24
We see all the team members are still asleep, except for
Miranda who is beginning a workout on a compact, anti~
gravity gym. :

The silver-gloved hand flashes the lightpen, and we cut to:

INT. CARGO BAY #3 - EARLY MORNING

Miranda is beginning a gymnastic routine when the shimmering
form of Royd's holographic spectre appears before her.

Miranda pauses briefly, holding her body aloft.

ROYD'S HOLO
Your stamina is quite impressive.

MIRANDA
(laughs) Compared to what?

. ROYD'S HOLO
Others, I've watched.

Miranda looks closely at the holograph, then resumes her
routine.

MIRANDA
My parents were geneticists.
I guess you could say I was their
private research project. They were
trying to create an improved model.

Miranda dismounts with a flourish, landing inches from the
specter. She picks up a towel.

ROYD'S HOLO
Obviously the experiment was
successful.

MIRANDA

Sometimes, I have my doubts. But I'd
much rather hear your life story,
Royd.

25
wt

ROYD'S HOLO
One as improved as you, should be
able to guess...

MIRANDA
{laughs) Allright, Royd. I'm in no
hurry. I love mysteries...

She walks right through the holograph's shimmering form and
out the door. The holograph remains in the empty room fora
moment as if stunned, then disappears.

INT. GALLEY - DAY

CLOSE ON A RECESSED VIDEO CAMERA - We follow the camera
tilting downward te see Darryl loading the last of the
dishes from breakfast into the robotic dishwasher. It closes
itself, then switches itself on.

He opens the refrigerator and removes a large rectangular
block of grey, gelatinous synthetic protein, then rinses it
in the anti-gravity sink. Humming to himself while he works,
Darryi sets the protein block on the counter, and pats it
ary with a towel.

Darryl] rummages through the drawers and cupboards looking
through the collection of exotic appliances (which belong to
the ship,) until he comes upon a trianguiar-shaped machine
whose appearance suggests an alien Cuisinart.

Darryl sets the machine on the counter. As he does, it makes
a soft-whirring noise as the top dilates, like the iris of a

camera.

DARRYL ‘
Cute.

He peers into the bowl, to see how the device cuts.

DARRYL'S POV - looking down into the transluscent,
trianguiar bowl. The blade is missing.

26
He looks back in the cupboard and finds a gleaming, double-
sided cutting tool, which obviously belongs to it.

Humming again, Darryl picks up the tool and reaches into
the bowl, attempting to insert it into the motor mount. We
hear a click, as the blade leeks into place.

Darryl starts to pull his hand out, when we hear the soft,
whirring noise as the iris/top closes around his forearn.
Looking a bit scared, he tries pulling his arm out, but it's
Clearly stuck. Then we hear a high-pitched whining noise.

CLOSE ON DARRYL - He looks down at the transluscent,
triangular bowl and screams as it turns bright red.

INT. CARGO BAY #2 - DAY

CLOSE ON A ROBOTIC ARM - It is using a cutting tool,
methodically slicing open the tops on a row of sealed
cardboard boxes.

We move back to reveal Owl typing into a computer terminal
which directs the operations of this surgical/scanner
machine to which the arm is connected.

ANGLE ON THE TABLE - After the boxes are sliced open, Owl
removes the contents: bottles of chemicals, beakers and
measuring devices, and other supplies, which he places on
shelves in the lab.

Owl reaches for the flask from his flight suit but finds it
empty. He returns to the workbench and picks up a box marked
DANGER: RADIOACTIVE MATERIALS.

He gingerly reaches into it, revealing it to be filled with
bottles of 100% grain alcohol. Owl opens one of bottles, and
and pours the contents into a coffee cup he is about to
drink when the door to the bay suddenly slides open.

Darryl walks slowly over to him, looking white as a ghost. A
bloody dish towel is wrapped around his right hand.

27
OWL
What the hell's happened?

. DARRYL
Let's just say, I'm an idiot...

He moves closer to Owl, starting to hand something to hin
when he nearly falls. Owl grabs him just as he loses
consciousness. He lifts Darryl up onto the table of the
surgical/scanner machine. Then he notices the small plastic
bag clutched tightly in his left hand.

Owl extracts the bag and we see that it contains the tips of
three of Darryl's fingers.

Blianching, Owl applies a tourniquet to Darryl's wrist, then
quickly sterilizes the hand and the severed fingers. Owl
clamps the hand to the table, moving the scanner head so
that it is directly over it. He goes to the computer
terminal, typing in a command.

CLOSE ON THE SCREEN ~ We see a detailed x-ray of Darryl's
hand. The image changes to a highly magnified view of the
end of one finger, showing the nerve endings.

Owl types in a series of commands which activate a robotic
hand connected to the surgical/scanner machine.

CLOSE OF THE ROBOTIC HAND - It picks up one of the
severed finger tips and lines it up with its former finger.

CLOSE ON THE SCREEN ~- We see the nerve endings moving until
they are perfectly lined up.

ANGLE ON THE SURGICAL/SCANNER HEAD - A thin, red laser beam
cauterizes the wound.

ANGLE ON OWL - He types in a command and a second robotic
hand applies a healing solution, then bandages the joint.

FADE TO:

28
INT. LOUNGE - DAY _

Darryl emerges from the galley, with a large bandage around
his right hand, holding a tray with pizza and assorted
drinks. He sets it down on the oval-shaped table where the
team have assembled.

DARRYL
Allright, anyone who makes a wise
crack does the dishes.

AUDREY
Anyone who's stupid enough to stick
his hand into a alien food
processor, deserves a wise crack.

DARRYL
Hey, I have an active and inquiring
mind. I can't help myself.

AUDREY
That's not the only thing he's got
that's active and inquiring. He's
lucky he cooks with his hands...

The door opens and Owl enters, walking towards the table.

DARRYL
My savior. Here, I set a special
place for you.

Darryl ushers Owl over to one of the chairs, where he's set
aplace witha cloth napkin, real silverware, and a wine
glass. Owl laughs, sitting down.

DARRYL
If you need anything that's not
on the menu, just let me know.

OWL
Give me a break, will you.

29
He takes a piece of pizza, and notices Royd's vacant seat at
the head of the table. Owl glances up at the recessed
holographic projector in the ceiling.

OWL
Anybody seen the phantom today?

AUDREY
Royd? He hasn't made an appearance
since breakfast.

DARRYL
You notice his clothes? They must be
10 years out of style.

LILLY
He makes me nervous... And I don't
think I'm the only one that feels
that way...

D'Branin stops eating and turns to her.

D'BRANIN
Could you be more specific?

Lilly seems self-conscious at being put on the spot.

LILLY
It's hard to explain. I guess I'd
feel a lot better if I could see
Royd in person... that's all.

DARRYL
I'd like to know something about his
personal background.

D'Branin snaps at them with surprising vehemence.

D'BRANIN
Have any of you been inconvenienced
by Royd's desire for privacy?
(mo one answers)
The port officials at Avalon had no
data on personal background.

30
Owl nods cynically, glancing up at the recessed projector in
the ceiling. .

OWL
No, data, huh...

He reaches for another slice of pizza and eats it as he
walks back toward the rear of the lounge.

ANGLE ON D'BRANIN - He works to control his temper.

OwL
I'll bet you Royd doesn't look
anything like that projection.

AUDREY
Why?

own
He's probably sick or so deformed
he's ashamed to show his true forn.
DARRYL
For all we know he could be some

kind of radioactive mutant... >

ANGLE ON MIRANDA - She smiles, amused by the speculation.

MIRANDA
Don't stop. It's just getting good.

DARRYL
Miranda, it's possible.

Own
He could have the Slow Plague. It
takes decades to kill... And then
there's New Leprosy and Langamen’'s
disease! Royd's probably in some
kind of self-imposed quarantine. ‘

ANGLE ON D'BRANIN - disgusted, he leaves the lounge.

31
LILLY
What's Langamen's disease?

OWL
Oh, that's when little greenish-
orangy spiny cysts form all over
your body and gradually turn into a
crispy, reddish-brown crust, like...
Like this!
(holding up his pizza to his cheek)
This is exactly what Langamen's
disease looks like... Before it
really takes hold.

AUDREY
Do you mind? I'm trying to eat!

Owl jJaughs and takes another bite. He turns away from them,
examining the rear wall of the lounge.

On the opposite wall, a hidden camera zooms in on hin.

INT. ROYD'S CABIN ~ DAY

We see Owl on the large video monitor. He runs his hand
along the wall, testing it for soundness. Behind him, we see
Jon and Eliza enter the lounge.

INT. LOUNGE ~ DAY

Jon has a bright, almost feverish look to his eyes, but
otherwise seems to be back to normal. He and Eliza sit at
the table as Darryl emerges from the galley with a fresh
pizza.

DARRYL
Jon! You're back with the living.
You had us a little worried
yesterday...

He sets the pizza on the table, then sits joining then.
Audrey comes over and sits next on the other side of Jon.

32
AUDREY
You look like you're feeling better.

Eliza looks at her, picking up on her interest in Jon.

AUDREY
“en Were you... able to get any closer
to what was bothering you?

JON
I think Eliza was right... It's just
getting acclimated to the energy on
the ship.
(He tastes a piece of pizza)
Mmmmmmm. Delicious.

DARRYL
Glad you like it. It's not easy to
toss a pizza with one hand....

He pantomimes tossing it.

CLOSE ON JON - He stares at Darryl's bandaged hand for a
moment, and we hear faint RUSHING sounds, as if Jon were
picking up psychic signals from it.

Darryl walks away and Jon glances at Miranda, who's watching
Owl checking out the rear wall of the lounge. Owl walks back
toward them with an odd look on his face.

: MIRANDA
Something wrong, Owl?

owL
I guess it depends on what side of
the wall you're on...

He sits back down at the table.
MIRANDA
Would you care to elaborate on

that... or were you just being
existential?

33
OWL
There's no doors to Royd's cabin,
I've already checked the hall. He's
sealed in there.

The room becomes silent as everyone looks in the direction of
the rear wall of the lounge.

Jon claps his hands, startling them.

Eliza looks panicked, but before she can stop him, Jon is
already up on his feet, beaming with delight.

JON
Are you kidding? He's sealed in
there? That's great! Forget
Langamen's disease... That opens up
a whole other set of possibilities.

owL

Pardon..

JON
You were wondering about Royd... Why
limit yourselves to diseases or
deformities? He could be real
monster! Like a gas giant from
Io! Crack open the forward buikhead
and watch that methane and ammonia
come smoking out!

Everyone stares at him, not knowing what to think. Only
Miranda seems amused.

ELIZA
He's kidding.

She looks like she's like to strangle Jon.
JON
I'm deadly serious. Royd could be

anything in the world... Don't any
of you love a mystery?

34
He looks out in the room. For a moment, his and Miranda's
eyes meet and we see the sparkle between them. Audrey sees
it and we sense her jealousy. Eliza also sees it, but we see
an understanding and no sign of resentment.

JON
Here we all are on an expedition to
intercept an alien starship from the
core of the galaxy... and you're
upset because you can't count the
warts on Royd's nose?

Owl, Darryl, Eliza and Lilly look at one another, as if
asking themseives if perhaps they've been overacting.

Jon comes back to the table and picks up a piece of pizza.
He bites into it and walks toward the door.

JON
Then again... he may not have a

nose.

Laughing to himself, he walks out of the lounge. Eliza
rises quickly, following him out.

After an brief pause, the rest of the team, rise and begin
filing out of the lounge.

ANGLE ON MIRANDA - amused by what has just transpired, she
takes a sip of coffee and turns to look at the wali-sized
screen.

BER POV - We see the view of space from the cameraonthe |
nose of the ship. The luminous, deep blue radiance fills the
screen.

FADE TO:

INT. CARGO HOLD #3 - NIGHT

Miranda is sitting cross-legged on the floor, studying a
holographic chessboard.

35
MIRANDA
Rook to queen's pawn.

The piece moves by itself to the sixth rank.

Miranda glances up at Royd's holographic specter which is
"seated" opposite her. His sigh is heard through the
communicator on the wall.

ROYD
I resign. That makes eight losses in
arow. Am I really worth playing?

MIRANDA
Of course you are.

ROYD
I should tie in my computer, you'd
never know.

: MIRANDA
T'd know within three moves. Try it.

Miranda gets up and walks directly through Royd's projection
on her way to the kitchen.

Royd's holograph looks disturbed as it stands watching her
get a beer from the mini-refrigerator.

ROYD'S BOLO
I wish you wouldn't do that.

Miranda walks through him again, feigning innecence. She
takes a large sip before turning back to him.

MIRANDA
Do what, Royd?

ROYD'S HOLO
You ability to play chess is only
exceeded by your ability to tease.
Was that built in along with your
other genetic improvements?

36
 

MIRANDA
(laughs) Actually, I had to develop
that on my own. Along with a few
other abilities... When are you
going to break down and let me visit
you in person, Captain?

She ignores the holograph, speaking directly towards the
video camera, mounted on the wall above her.

INT. ROYD'S CABIN - NIGHT

CLOSE ON THE OVAL MONITOR - We see Miranda looking directly
at us, with the holograph standing behind her, like an
injured lover.

MIRANDA
Don't you get lonely in there?
Claustrophobic? Sexually frustrated?

INT. CARGO BAY #3 + NIGHT
Miranda continues to ignore the holograph behind her.

ROYD'S HOLO ;
I've flown the Nightflyer all my
life, Miranda. If I were subject to
claustrophobia, sexual frustration
or loneliness, such a life would
have been impossible.

MIRANDA
It won't be long, Royd... and I'll
know why.

She turns around and the holograph disappears into thin air.

FADE TO:

37
INT. JON'S CABIN - NIGHT

Jon is sleeping uneasily in his bunk. We move in’ close on
his face. The RUSHING sound we heard earlier becomes
progressively louder until it becomes an EXPLOSION. Jon
awakens suddenly. Catching his breath, he looks over at
Eliza sleeping in the adjacent bed. He moves to wake her
then changes his mind and quietly leaves the room.

INT. NIGHTFLYER ~ D'BRANIN'S CABIN - NIGHT

Large color transparencies of cave paintings, radio
telescopic images, and artistic renderings of the Volcryn
are clipped to an illuminated walls. There is an
overabundance of research material piled everywhere.

D'Branin takes a sip of coffee as he re-reads one of the
legends on his computer. He presses the illuminated panel on
the wall.

D‘BRANIN
Royd..?

Royd's voice comes over the com system:

ROYD
Yes, Dr. D'Branin.

D'BRANIN
According to our schedule, we still
have a little over 72 hours before
we actually drop out.

D'Branin is startled by Royd's holograph materializing
beside him.

ROYD'S HOLO
Correct, 72 hours and 26 minutes...
Forgive me if I startled you...

D'BRANIN

Not at all. I just wasn't expecting
a... personal visit.

38
~-%

He studies the holograph, glancing at it's hidden source in
the ceiling. Then he looks at one of the Voleryn
illustrations,

taking a deep sip from his mug.

D'BRANIN
Iam so close now. After twelve
years, it seems hard to believe.

ROYD'S HOLO
The consummation, of so much work...
I can imagine your excitement.

D'BRANIN
Think of it Royd... A race of
sentients sailing out from some
unknown origin in the core of the
galaxy, bound for intergallactic
space... always keeping to the
interstellar depths, no planetfalis,
seldom coming within a lightyear of
a star... If only we can communicate
with them... To know the why of
then.

The holograph smiles. D'Branin locks over at it, beginning
to think of it as a friend.

ROYD
Boctor, I've wanted to thank you...
for respecting my privacy.

D'BRANIN
Don't mention it, Royd... It's
certainly one thing we're all..:

There is a pounding on the door. The holograph disappears.

D'BRANIN
Come in.

Jon enters and closes the door quickly. He looks as ill as
we've seen him since he's boarded the ship.

3s
JON
We have to turn back. Immediately.

D'Branin tries not to lose his temper.

D'BRANIN
I'm afraid that's not possible.
What's the problem? Are you picking
up the Volcryn?

Jon shakes his head. He speaks to D'Branin telepathically:

JON (V.0.)
No. This is close. On the ship.
Something volatile... dangerous. I
haven't been able to get to the
source yet...

CLOSE ON D'BRANIN - He is startled to hear Jon's words
inside his own skull. He starts to say something.

JON (V.0.)
Don't speak aloud!

This is too much for D'’Branin and he raises his voice:

D'BRANIN
Have you've talked to Eliza about
this?

JON
No. I feit I should see you right
away.

D'BRANIN

I appreciate that, but there's nothing
I can do unless you have something
concrete.

JON
This is reai!

D'Branin gets up and walks him to the door.

40
D'BRANIN
Talk to Eliza. I'm sure she can help
you.

Jon leaves, looking even more disturbed than before.
D'Branin returns to his desk. He =ttempts to return to work
but is unable to throw off an uneasy feeling. He presses the

com button again.

D'BRANIN
Royd...

There is no response. He closes his computer and leaves the
cabin.
INT. ELIZA AND JON'S CABIN - NIGHT

Eliza is asleep in bed when there is a knock on the door.
She wakes up, and is disturbed at seeing Jon's bed empty.

CLOSE ON ELIZA - She closes her eyes and we DISSOLVE TO:

HER MIND'S EYE POV - Jon can be seen walking down the dinly-
iit corridor of the ship, heading towards Cargo Bay #3.

BACK TO SCENE - We hear the knock again. Eliza opens the
door, revealing D'Branin standing in the hallway. He peers

around her and sees that she's alone.

D'BRANIN
ZI was looking for Jon...

ELIZA
Can I can help you with something?

D'Branin enters and the door closes behind him.
D'BRANIN

He came to see me earlier... about a
threat of some sort.

41
ey

ELIZA
I see. Did he tell you anything

specific?

D'BRANIN
No... but he seemed extremely
disturbed.

ELIZA

Class ten's are all unstable in one
way or another. It's the price you
pay for that kind of sensitivity.
I'll have to give him more Psionine.

D'BRANIN
Psionine?

ELIZA
A powerful psychic damper. His
receptivity will be severly
curtailed for several days..

D'BRANIN
Several days!? We need him! We'll
be dropping out of drive...

ELIZA
Do you want to lose him for the rest
of the flight?

It's becoming progressively more difficult for D'Branin to
control his temper.”

D'BRANIN
Have you come to any conclusions yet
about what he's been picking up?

ELIZA
His mind is in such a state of
chaos, it's impossible to
evaluate what's coming in.

D'BRANIN
You're supposed to be an empath!

42
ELIZA
I am an empath! If you don't trust.
me, you shouldn't have hired me.

D'BRANIN
I apologize... We're so close now...
and there is so much at stake...
I'm... Are you absolutely sure he
has to remain dampened?

ELIZA
The only other option would be to
give him an injection of esperon. It
would triple his psionic receptivity
for a few hours. Open him up completely.

D'BRANIN
And we'd find out if it this thing
is real or not?

ELIZA
(She nods) But, I don't think he's
stable enough to deal with that kind
of power. Psionine is safer. If his
paranoia persists, we'll know it has
nothing to do with his telepathy.

D'BRANIN
And if it doesn't?

ELIZA
Then we'll know there's a real
threat.

D'Branin stares at her oddly for a moment. Eliza laughs,
having read his mind.

ELIZA
In answer to your question... No,
I'm not a complete fraud.

D'Branin smiles, somewhat reassured.

43
D'BRANIN
Please keep me informed.

The door opens and he leaves.

INT. ROYD'S CABIN - NIGHT

CLOSE ON OVAL MONITOR - We see Jon walking down the corridor
which leads to Cargo Bay #3 and Miranda's cabin.

INT. CORRIDOR APPROACHING CARGO BAY #3 - NIGHT

Jon looks weak and physically unstable as he approaches the
entrance to the bay. A recessed camera up near the ceiling,
pans in his direction. Jon stares at it.

We begin to hear the rhythmic, RUSHING sounds, which grow
louder as Jon approaches the camera. He begins to sweat
visibly and leans back against the wall for support. The
RUSHING sounds come progressively faster until they are
constant.

CLOSE ON JON - He holds his ears, falling to the floor.

JON'S POV - The fabric covering the walls seems to burn
away, revealing the network of glowing red "veins" which
pulse throughout the entire ship. The RUSHING sound grows
louder and louder as we move in closer to the veins,
following them into the wali.

We see that all the veins run into an enormous, intricately
faceted, ruby-colored stone which glows with its own fiery,
inner light. We move in on this stone until it fills the
screen. From 0.S. we hear Jon scream.

BACK TO SCENE ~ Miranda emerges from the bay to see Jon on
the floor, clutching his head. She rushes over and kneels
beside him.

CLOSE ON JON - He looks up at her as if his mind were a
great distance away.
CLOSE ON MIRANDA ~ She takes Jon's hand, speaking to him
telepathically:

MIRANDA (V.0.)
Talk to me Jon... What is it?

Behind them, D'Branin and Eliza appear from the opposite end
of the corridor. She yelis to Miranda:

ELIZA
Don't touch him!

Eliza and D'Branin get to Jon at just about the same time as
the rest of the team arrive. Jon speaks aloud:

JON
An alien mind...

She kneels down beside him, trying to get through to him
telepathically.

ELIZA (V.0.)
I feel it too, Jon... Don't resist
it! Let it come through you!

Jon suddenly gets to his feet, trying to run.

ELIZA
Jon! (To the others) Stop him!

Owl and Darryl grab Jon, wrestling him to the ground.
CLOSE ON JON - He is on the verge ‘of psychosis now.
Eliza takes her injection gun from her medical bag but as
she approaches Jon, he whips his head from side to side,
smashing it into one of the ship's metal support struts. He
passes cut as blood begins pouring everywhere.

ELIZA

Quick! Help me get him into the
medical bay!

4s
Owl lifts him onto his shoulder and carries him down the
corridor.

INT. CARGO BAY # 2 - NIGHT

CLOSE ON THE SURGICAL SCANMER MACHINE ~ It gleams softly in
the room's dim light. .

OwL
Clear the table off!

Audrey and Lilly do as they're told and Jon is Jaid down on
the table. Meanwhile, Eliza, and Miranda work quickly,
Cleaning, and suturing the wound.

ELIZA
Let's get the scanner on hin.

Darryl and D'Branin attach arm and leg restraints to Jon.
The others observe as Owl nervously types a series of
commands into the computer which controls the scanner.

CLOSE ON OWL - He can't seem to get the machine to do what
he wants it to do. Sweating, he reaches for his “coffee"

cup, and a takes a drink. Setting it back down beside the
terminal, he types another command and watches the screen.

CLOSE ON THE SCREEN - It lights up with a drawing that
show's Jon form, lying on the table. His brain and vital
internal organs are highlighted.

OWL
Alright.. >

Owl type in another command and the scanner head jerks to
life then starting at Jon's feet, begins moving swiftly up
his body toward his head. Owl begins to relax. He takes
another sip from his cup and sets it back down.

CLOSE ON THE COMPUTER SCREEN - The scanner head passes over

each organ, revealing all vital signs: respiration, heart
beat and brain waves all appear to be normal.

46
OWL
There's no fracture... I don't see
i _anything metabolically wrong with him.

Jon starts to regain consciousness. Eliza comes over to him.
i ELIZA
How are you feeling?

Jon looks up as a hidden camera, high up on the wall, pans
in his direction. He watches it with the same wide-eyed
expression as before.

JON
We're being watched.

D'BRANIN
The symptoms seem to be persisting.

Eliza takes the injection gun from her medical bag and fills
it with psionine.

" D'BRANIN
' Why don't you try the Esperon... as
you suggested.

Eliza hesitates, evidently not wanting to do it.

MIRANDA
Couldn't Esperon boost his signais
to a-point where he could focus on
the threat?

ELIZA
I aware of the characteristics of...

OWL
Absolutely! Give him some Esperon!
He'll be able to tell us Royd's
entire life history!

MIRANDA

Hold. it. I don't think focusing on
on Royd is the point...

47
_ ... OWL
No? Then you're the only one.

Miranda looks back, seeing that the others all seem to
be in agreement with him. They all look at D'Branin.

D'Branin doesn't want to offend Royd, but he wants a mutiny
even less. He turns to Eliza.

D'BRANIN
Give him the Esperon.

Eliza looks at Jon on the table and then back at D'Branin,
in way that makes it clear that this is his responsibility.
She removes the Psionine from the injection gun and takes a
vial of Esperon from her medical bag.

CLOSE ON JON - He stares at the vial.
JON'S POV: CLOSE ON THE VIAL ~ The ruby colored drug almost
seems to glow with it's own light.

Eliza loads the Esperon into the injection gun. As she
brings it closer to Jon, he screams:

JON
NO! PLEASE!!

Royd's holograph appears beside the table.

ROYD
There's no need for that. Release
hin.

OWL

He HAS been watching us.

D'BRANIN
I'm sorry this had to happen Royd.

48
AUDREY
Sorry!?

ROYD'S HOLO
I'll tell you my great secret, if my
privacy intimidates you s0...
Although your guesses were amusing,
I'm afraid they were far from the
mark. In truth, I am only...

CLOSE ON VIDEO CAMERA - High up on the wall, the camera
silently pans over to Owl.

INT. ROYD'S CABIN; CONTROL CONSOLE ~ NIGHT

On the master monitor, the image zooms in on Owl as he
surreptitiously grabs the injection gun and pushes it
against Jon's neck.

INT. CARGO BAY#3 - NIGHT

Royd's holograph moves right beside Owl. His voice roars
into the bay:

ROYD
NO! Stop. I order it! This is my
ship. STOP!

Owl presses the trigger, emptying the drug into Jon's
bloodstream.

There is a silence in the room as everyone waits for the
drug to take effect. Eliza watches Jon closely as he
slowly looks over at her, beginning to shiver.

JON
I'm cold.... It's so cold...

ELIZA
It's the Esperon.... It'll stop ina
minute. Let it help you... Tell us
what you see.

49
@

Jon stops shaking. His blue eyes cloud over.

JON
Not close enough.

ELIZA
~Relax. It'll give you the range...
Can you feel it? Everything is
getting clearer now, isn't it?

Jon's eyes clear. He laughs, in an oddly casual fashion as
if amused by a revelation.
CLOSE ON A HIDDEN VIDEO CAMERA - it zooms in for a closeup.
CLOSE ON JON - He stares at the camera, as if really seeing
the person behind it. Then a look of panic envelopes him. He
turns to Eliza and clutches her hand. She strokes his
forehead. .
ELIZA

It*ll clear. Don't be afraid. Just

tell us what you see.
CLOSE ON JON ~ From his face, we dissolve to:

HIS POV: INT. ROYD'S CABIN - NIGHT

On the oval monitor, we see a fairly wide shot of Jon on the
operating table, with the holograph standing nearby.

An adjacent monitor, shows a close up of the computer
terminal, which controls the surgical/scanner.

The image pans over to the cup which Owl had set down
earlier. Sitting beneath the cup we can see the computer
which controls the scanner/surgical machine.

CLOSE ON THIS SMALLER SCREEN - Seemingly on it's own power,
the cup begins to slide, towards the edge of the table.

om.

INT. CARGO BAY #3 ~- NIGHT

CLOSE ON JON - He looks over at the computer terminal,
staring as if in a trance.

HIS POV ~ The cup continues sliding, until it falls off the
edge of the table... and onto the computer lying beneath it.

As is does, the liquid causes a sparking to oecur in the
computer. And the sparking ignites the alcohol.

D'BRANIN
Owl, what the hell's going on!?

OWL .
The computer's shorting out. Get the
extinguisher!

Darryl finds the extinguisher and brings it over to the
computer, spraying it on the fire. It puts out the fire,
creating a thick cloud of steam and smoke. But the sparking
gets worse, and several lights on the operating table blow
out, making it even darker.

We hear a strange buzzing noise. Jon looks up, to his right.

JON'S POV = The laser surgical arm jerks to life shooting a
thin crimson beam out into the dimly-lit bay.

ELIZA
What the heli's going on? Shut the
machine!

She frantically tries to unclamp Jon's arm restraints, but
one of the robotic surgical hands jerks to life, smashing
into her temple. She slumps to the floor.

Owl rushes over to the computer terminal and finds it no
longer has any effect on the machine. He reaches for the

power switch.

CLOSE ON THE SWITCH - As Owl's hand approaches it, the
surgical arm whips around, cutting across his wrist.

$1
Owl screams, pulling his hand away. He tries again and is
burned even worse this time.
OWL
Dammit!

D'BRANIN
There's got to be some other way of
shutting it off... Royd!

ROYD'S HOLO
There is no remote response. You'll
have to physically sever the machine
from it's power source.

Jon is still lying on the table, but no one can get near
him. He looks at the holograph and suddenly yells out:

JON
He's not controlling it at all! It's
his...

But his voice is cut off by a sickening, sizzling noise as
the laser beam cuts through Jon's neck, decapitating him.

Lilly screams, and the others react to the sight of Jon's
headless torso on the operating table. On it's next arc, the
laser slices off Jon's left arm at the shoulder

The screaming continues as the machine begins randomly
performing portions of preprogrammed surgical operations:
One of Jon's eyes are extracted. In another pass, a non-
existent tumor is operated on.

Interspersed with the precise surgical moves, the laser
continues shooting erratically in all directions. Miranda
runs away from the table and over to a work bench where she
grabs a small, laser cutting torch. She switches it on. The
torch produces a thin, sapphire-colored beam.

Keeping low, she heads back to the surgical/scanner machine.

Inching as close as she dares, Miranda aims the torch at the
cable running from the machine to the ship's power outlet.

52
 

 

She turns the torch's power up all the way and the thin blue
beam severs the cable in less than a second.

The surgical/scanner machine suddenly goes dead.

D'Branin and the others stare in horror at the carnage
around then.

Miranda comes over to where Eliza is lying on the floor, in
@ semi-conscious state. She kneels down by her and sees that
a small piece of metal has snapped off from the surgical
hand, and is imbedded into her temple.

MIRANDA

Owl, help me get her into her cabin.

Audrey, can the three of you wrap

Jon in those sheets and get him into

the pod bay?
The three of them overcome their revuision, swiftiy doing as
they're told, following Miranda and Owl out of the bay.
Finding himself alone, D'Branin calls out:

D'BRANIN
Royd...

But there is no response.

INT. CARGO BAY #1; MIRANDA'S CABIN - NIGHT

Zliza is heavily sedated, lying on her bed while Miranda
removes the metal fragment from her forehead. .

ANGLE ON MIRANDA - Working quickly, she applies a liquid
suture to the wound, then covers Eliza with a blanket and
leaves the roon.

INT. LOUNGE - NIGHT

Miranda enters, finding rest of the ‘team already there.

§3
LILLY
I still don't understand what
could've caused... what happened.

OWL
What there not to understand? Jon
was about to reveal the truth about
Royd, and he killed hin.

MIRANDA
Actually, I think Royd was about to
"reveal the truth", himself, when you
gave Jon the injection.

OwL
Come off it. Look what he did to
hin!

MIRANDA

How could Royd have caused the
machine to behave that way?

OWL
That's what we'd like to know!

MIRANDA
Sorry, but I don't believe it. And
there doesn't seem to be any
evidence to support Royd's guilt.

AUDREY
Did you see how fast his holograph
disappeared when it happened?

MIRANDA
This is all pure conjecture...

The door to the lounge opens and a grim-looking D'Branin
enters, carrying his a small flightbag. He sits beside Miranda.

MIRANDA
(Continued)
We can't condemn Royd until we hear
his side of what happened.

54
He places his
broken pieces

OWL
So where is he?

D'BRANIN
How is Eliza?

MIRANDA
She's still in shock, but she'll be
okay.

AUDREY
Viadimir, have you talked to Royd
about what happened in there?

D'BRANIN
No... But I've done a little
investigating and I believe this may
answer a number of questions.

briefcase on the table and takes out the
ef Owl's cup which fell on the computer.

DARRYL
What is is?

Owl recognizes it immediately.

D'BRANIN
It's a "coffee" cup, (he sniffs it)
Although it's apparently used for
more... volatile liquids.

OWL .
What are you saying? Are you saying
I'm responsible for what happened in
there?

D'BRANIN
I'm saying we all just witnessed a
terrible, accident. I don't believe
anyone was necessarily at fault...

55
Owl stares at the pieces of the cup on the table which
prevent him from arguing further.

D'BRANIN (Continuing)
My feeling is that Royd is as
shocked as we are about what
happened. He probably fears that we
blame him. I hope we can reassure
him this is not the case.

He looks around to see if there are anymore protests or
questions. There are none and he closes his briefcase.

D'BRANIN:
I assume we all have our final
preparations to complete...

LILLY
But we're returning to Avalon...
aren't we?

D'Branin stares at her incredulously.

D'BRANIN
Absolutely not! We're less than 8
hours from dropping out of drive and
I see no reason to return.

He rises and leaves the lounge. The dissenting members of
the team look at one another, following him out in silence.
Only Miranda remains. She pours herself a glass of brandy
from the crystal decanter on the oval table and takes a sip.

MIRANDA
Captain... Did you hear?

The glowing form of Royd's holograph is reflected in
Miranda's glass, as it materializes behind her. She turns
toward him.

ROYS'S HOLO
Yes. I hear and see... everything...
on my Nightflyer, Miranda. But I
assumed that you already knew that.

56
MIRANDA
-- -  - You're correct.

ROYS'S HOLO
Are you going to reassure me now?

Miranda laughs.

MIRANDA
Isn't my very presence reassuring?

She carries her glass over to the wali-sized video monitor
where she stands, looking out at space.

INT. LOUNGE - NIGHT

Miranda is sitting in the couch. sipping her brandy. Royd's
holograph hovers close to her.

ROYS'S HOLO
I'm pleased that at least you and
Dr. D’Branin do not think I murdered
Jon. You were correct that I was
about to reveal my secret when...
the accident occurred.

Miranda turns, looking directly up at the recessed video
camera.

. MIRANDA
Who are you, Captain?

. ROYD'S HOLO
Your guesses were amusing, but
sadly, the truth is less dramatic. IT
am an ordinary man.

MIRANDA
Then why all the secrecy?

CLOSE ON THE HOLOGRAPH - The eyes gleam strangely as if the
specter possessed a pride of nobility.

57
ROYD'S HOLO
My mother was a freetrader, a
notably successful one. But she
disliked people. When she grew rich
enough, she had the Nightflyer built
to her specifications; a ship that
needed no crew.

MIRANDA
What about you?

ROYD'S HOLO
After thirty years of flying alone,
Mother became bored. Actually, I
should not call her my mother. I am
her cross-sex clone. I was bred to
be her companion and lover.

ANGLE ON MIRANDA - She listens to Royd calmly without any
visible reaction or judgement.

\

ROYD'S HOLO
I was placed in an embryonic tank
but she died before my birth.
She had programmed the ship for such
an event, however. It drifted in
interstellar space for eleven years
while the ships's computer raised
me.

MIRANDA
And this ship replicates the
conditions of your birth, doesn't
it?

ROYD'S HOLO

Three moves ahead, as usual,
Miranda. If mother taught me one
thing, it is that my body has no
natural immunities and that ecentact
with any of you would probably kill
me.

{CONTINUED)

58
ROYD
(Continued)

The gravity the Nightfiyer is
generating is for your comfort, not
mine. To me it is agony... The
floating chair that Iam sitting in
supports my weight, but the painis
still intense. So you see why I
can't take on passengers too often.

MIRANDA
Why take on people at all?

ROYD'S HOLO
Unlike my mother, I enjoy company. I
like to study the aliens I take on
as riders.

MIRANDA
Aliens?

ROYD'S BOLO
You are all aliens to me.

There is a long silence.

MIRANDA
I understand... Royd, if I asked you
to, would you agree not to watchor
listen in on us... except in here? I
think it would make a big difference
to the others.

ROYD'S HOLO
Even if I agreed, you'd still have
no way of knowing. :
INT. ROYD'S CABIN ~ NIGHT
CLOSE ON THE OVAL MONITOR - Miranda can be seen in the

lounge, with the holograph standing near her. We see the
the rest of the ship on the other monitors.

59
MIRANDA
e Except by trusting you.

There is a brief silence.

ROYD'S HOLO
As you wish. I will henceforth
restrict myself to this room.

The silver-gloved hand picks up the lightpen. As it flashes,
all the video screen go black, save for the oval monitor.

Miranda turns away from the holograph so that she is looking
directly at us. The image zooms in so that her face fills
the screen.

MIRANDA
I believe you.

INT. CARGO HOLD #1- NIGHT

Audrey angrily storms into the bay with Lilly following
close behind.

AUDREY
What a jerk! I wonder if we have
grounds for aborting the mission or
at least taking over...

LILLY
Taking over? Do think you might be
overreacting?

AUDREY

No! I don't! Surgical scanners's
Just don't short-circuit like that.
Somebody had to have been
controlling it.

She walks over to the main work table and Lilly follows.

LILLY
Why don't you tell D'Branin that?

60
aa AUDREY
@ Because he wouldn't believed me.

She takes a length of cable and begins patching it from the
team's computer into one of the ship's built-in terminals.

LILLY
What are you doing?

AUDREY
I'm linking our computer with the
ship's.

LILLY

I can see that. Why?

Audrey kneels down to the spot on the wali where she's going
to patch in.

: AUDREY
e ITwant find out the truth about
Royd. Do you want to help?

LILLY
I have a feeling Viadimir wouldn't -
appreciate this.
AUDREY
That's too bad. Do you want to help
or not?
Lilly watches Audrey for a moment, then she reluctantly
reaches for a wire cutter and a cable connector.
INT. LOUNGE - NIGHT
Miranda sits, thinking about everything Royd has told her.
MIRANDA

Se What really happened in there, Royd?
What killed Jon? One of us? The Volcryn?

61
oy

ae

Royd is silent.

Silence.

MIRANDA
Are we in danger? Am I foolish not
to be afraid?

ROYD'S HOLO
I like people. Particularly you and
Dr. D'Branin. You have nothing to
fear, I can protect you.

x MIRANDA
From what..?

MIRANDA
What about the others, Royd? Will
you protect them also?

. ROYD'S HOLO
We've talked long enough. I have
work to perform.

MIRANDA
I won't keep you.

She finishes her brandy and rises from the couch.

ROYD'S HOLO
Miranda...

MIRANDA
Yes...

ROYD'S HOLO

I... admire you more than anyone
I've ever met...

Miranda's laugh is rich and deep.

MIRANDA
That's quite @ compliment.

62
She moves slowly towards the holograph glowing in the
air before her. .

ROYD'S HOLO
I asked you not to...

But Miranda stops before passing through it. She holds out
her hand. Royd's slowly rises to meet hers. Ever-so-
delicately her toned, muscular flesh touches his pale
radiance.

As Miranda looks into the holograph's eyes, it suddenly
disappears. She stands there a moment and then leaves the
lounge.

INT. CARGO BAY #1 - NIGET

Audrey is sitting at the Nightfiyer's terminal while Lilly
checks the place they've patched in with her multimeter.

LILLY
That's it.

AUDREY
Maybe we could even take over the
ship's flight controls.

Audrey types in a command and Lilly comes over, sitting
beside her.

LILLY.
Theoretically possible, but I doubt
it... Let's see if we can get
in first...

Audrey types in another command and the screen filis up with
data,

AUDREY
Look at this...

Lilly studies the code on the screen.

63
LILLY
That's the data on the hardware.
Forget about taking over. The
Nightflyer's system is about ten
times more powerful than ours...

Audrey types another command.

AUDREY
This is interesting... the life
support specs.

~ LILLY
Mmmmmm. It looks like Royd isn't an
artificial intelligence system after
all.

Audrey types in another command.

, AUDREY
Nothing unusual here. Any other
ideas?
LILLY

You could check for nutrient tanks,
cloning equipment, that sort of
thing. Find Royd's life history~- the
trading records, if there are any.

AUDREY
That's it! The ship's log. There
must be one.

As she types in a new command an alarm goes off.

AUDREY
Shit!

Then an ominous bass rumbling is heard behind them. They

turn to see a huge, grey, steel panel slides across the
access to the corridor.

64
AUDREY
What the..?

LILLY
The backup airseal.

They look at each other resliting the implications.

AUDREY
Quick!

She grabs Lilly and they run towards the door, as they do,
a hideous, whistling sound can be heard, from the direction
of the outer airlock.

AUDREY
Come on!

They sprint towards the inner door. The whistling noise is
deafening and the vacuum is already pulling at things that
aren't bolted down.

Lilly is struck by a flying cardboard box and she trips.
Audrey is considerably faster than she is, and doesn't
notice that Lilly is down until she's at the outer lock.

Audrey starts back in to help her, but as she does, Lilly is
sucked up off the floor, and across the bay, smashing

with bone breaking force, against the doors cf the outer
airlock. She hangs there a moment untii the doors open wide
enough for her to be sucked out into space.

The roaring and whistling noise drowns out her own screams
as Audrey feels her feet being pulled out from under her.
She grabs on to a chair, which is boited to the floor, and
pulls her way, over it, then over a desk, managing to get
enough forward momentum to push herself back toward the
still-closing, grey-steel door of the backup airlock. She
slips through the crack at the last possible second before
it clangs loudly into place.

65
INT. CARGO HOLD #3 - NIGHT

The sound of an explosion is heard and alarms go off alli
ever the ship. The ship lurches so violently Miranda is
thrown out of her bunk to the ground. Then just as suddenly,
everything is still. Miranda gets up and presses the
communicator on the wall.

MIRANDA
Royd, what's happening?

ROYD (0.S.)
I'm still trying to find out.

Miranda tries to rouse Zliza. She opens her eyes slowly,
looking very stoned. Miranda gets a safety strap and secures
her tightly in her bunk, then leaves the cabin.

INT. MAIN CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Miranda walks down the corridor, picking up the other
Members of the team as they emerge from their respective
quarters.

They gather in the corridor like refugees from some natural
disaster. D'Branin turns to Miranda:

D'BRANIN
What happened?

Miranda hits the call button on the communicator mounted on
the wall. Royd's voice rings out through the corridor,

MIRANDA
Royd, we're missing two of our team.

ROYD (V.0.)
I'm afraid that since I've
deactivated all my monitors save for
the one in the lounge ~ at Miranda's
request, ~ I have no way of knowing
for certain where they are.

66
D'BRANIN
Reactivate them, goddammit!

There is a brief pause.

ROYD (V.0.)
Cargo hold #2 is badly damaged. It
was breached while we were under
drive. The Nightflyer's computer
automatically dropped us out of
drive otherwise we would've been
completely torn apart by the flux.

Darryl and Audrey exchange looks.

MIRANDA
How did it happen, Captain?

As Royd answers, Audrey walks into view, looking as if she's
in a state of shock. She and sits down in a corner, tucking
herself into a near-fetal position.

ROYD (V.0.)
The flight log records that your
colleagues had issued a command
which erroneously opened the held's
loading dock. They seem to have been
using the system to gain access to
the Nightflyer's flight controls.

D'Branin turns to Audrey.

D'BRANIN
Is that true?

Audrey's silence answers the question.

D'BRANIN
Where's Lilly?

Audrey remains silent and D'Branin screams at her:

D'BRANIN
I'm asking you a question!

67
Audrey breaks down, sebbing uncontrollably and unable to
speak. Miranda comes over and puts an arm around her.

D'Branin looks at her as if not knowing how to relate to
her. He speaks into the communicator:

D'BRANIN
Royd, do you have any information
about Lilly?

ROYD (V.0.)
It appears she is no longer on
board the ship. We can only assume
that she is dead.

D'BRANIN
I see.

ROYD (V.0.)
I'm hopeful that the damage to the
ship is not irreparable.

CLOSE ON D'BRANIN - The shock of what just happened begins
to set in on him. He just sits there in a daze. Miranda
replies for him.

MIRANDA
Captain, we'll leave you to assess
the damage and we'll continue this
discussion in the morning.

She switches off the communicator. Owl turns to her.

own
You believe him, don't you?

MIRANDA
I don't know, but I do know that
the other cargo hold can be opened
the same way number two was. I'm
moving my sleep web in to Eliza's
cabin, and I suggest that the rest
ef you should move into the lounge.

68
- ll --  DARRYL
e I think we should take our suits out
of the pod bay and keep them nearby.

MIRANDA
Good idea. Royd can't blame us for
taking precautions.

/ OWL
BLAME US!!? For Christ's sake,
ROYD ERRIS IS KILLING US!

Looking at Owl, Miranda sees no point in arguing. D'Branin
mutters to himself.

D'BRANIN
We've lost the computer...

MIRANDA
Perhaps we can make do with the
portables.

D'Branin nods distractedly.

D'BRANIN
I'm not about to lose them. Not
after...

He looks around the room at everyone in an odd way, as if
noticing them for the first time. Then he rises and walks
down the corrider toward his cabin.

Own
Them?

DARRYL
The Voleryn, obviously! You don't
think he cares about losing us do
you?

AUDREY
@ That's not true.
~_-—%

The others turn to look at her.

AUDREY
If we were all dead, he wouldn't
have anyone to help him document his
precious creatures. Believe me, that
would upset him.

MIRANDA
He's as upset as the rest of us.
Maybe more so...

DARRYL
What are we going to do?

MIRANDA
Under the circumstances I think it
would be best to leave our captain
alone. Both accident occurred when
People were trying to uncover Royd's
secret.

: OWL
And you don't think that's just a
teensy bit suspicious?

MIRANDA
Enough that I don't intend to be the
next one to give it a crack...
I'm going to get some sleep. I
suggest the rest of you do the same.

She leaves the lounge. Darryl looks over at the communicator
on the wall and then whispers to Owl:

: DARRYL
Do you think he can hear us?

Owl looks at him as if he's a fool to even ask.

OWL
Let's get our suits.

70
He comes over and helps Audrey up. The three of them walk
down the corridor. We move in close to the glowing red light
on the communicator and DISSOLVE To:

INT. D'BRANIN'S ROOM - NIGHT

CLOSE UN ANOTHER RED COMMUNICATOR LIGHT - We move back to
reveal D'Branin working at his desk as the light of false
day comes up slowly in the cabin. The door opens and as
Miranda enters, nearly loses her balance as the ship rolis
on its axis. She presses the communicator on the wall.

MIRANDA
Royd?

ROYD (V.0.)
Yes, Miranda.

MIRANDA
How bad is it?

RoYD (0.S.)

Hold three is completely ruined.
We're extremely fortunate, however,
as the drive system still seem to be
intact... I'm worried about our
return trip. I don't know if the
airseal can stand the stress of
going back into drive. It could tear
the ship in half.

D'BRANIN
Is there anything we can do?

ROYD (V.0O.)
I can reinforce the exposed areas
with some of the hull that was torn
loose. It's still floating within a
Kilometer of the ship.

D'BRANIN

We have four pods of our own... We
could retrieve the pieces.

myself. But that's not my primary
concern.

MIRANDA
You? But what about your muscles,
your weakness... can't we help you?

ROYD (V.0.)
I'm only crippled in gravity.
Weightless, I'm in my own element
and I plan to kill the gravity grid
shortly. If I emerge from my
chambers do you think you can keep
the others from killing me?

D'BRANIN
Royd, we're not criminals. How can
you think that we'd try and harm you?

ROYD [V.0.)
You know they're suspicious of me.
Don't give me false assurances.

MIRANDA
You would be in danger, but I think
that by showing yourself you'd set
them at ease. At least they could
see that you told them the truth.

ROYD (V.0.)
They think I killed their friends.
They're frightened.

D'BRANIN
I don't see how we can give you any
guarantees.

ROYD (V.0.}
I might have prevented the
accident... But you made me turn off
my monitors,. Miranda.

72
Miranda and D'Branin exchange glances.

ROYD (V.0.)
How can you protect me if I come
out?

D'BRANIN

I can send the others off to
retrieve the hull fragments, and
Miranda can stay with you. We'll get
it done three times as fast.

ROYD (¥V.0.}
As you will. I'm going to depower
the gravity grid. Prepare your crew.

MIRANDA
One of our team is injured. I think
she should remain on board to...

Royd's voice blasts through the com system:

ROYD (V.0.)
NONE OF YOUR TEAM MAY REMAIN ON
BOARD! NO ONE!

The monitor crackles and then shuts off. D'Branin and
Miranda look at each other then leave the cabin.

EXT. SPACE; NIGHTFLYER ~ NIGHT

CLOSE ON MIRANDA ~ dressed in her space~suit, she is waiting
in her pod. Behind her, the rest of the crew are gathering
hull fragments: D'Branin, with Eliza on his pod, Audrey and
Darryl on a second pod. Owl is off separate from them on the
third.

MIRANDA'S POV - The Nightflyer floats languidly amid the
alien starscape. The smaller sphere which comprises hold #2,
is shattered, but a major section portion of metal dangles
from it, giving it an unbalanced look.

73
A circular airlock in the front of the ship, dilates, and
Royd flies out. His pod is larger and of an odd design.

ANGLE ON MIRANDA - We can see the anticipation in her eyes
as Royd approaches.

ANGLE ON ROYD - He glides closer to Miranda. As his pod
emerges from a shadow , we can see his face... the same, yet

somehow younger than his holograph. He looks frightened.

Royd and Miranda look at each other for a moment in silence.

ROYD
We have a good deal of work to do,
Miranda.

MIRANDA

First, let's talk.

She maneuvers her pod close enough to his, so that they are
touching. :

MIRANDA
Turn off your comm. The sound will
carry through the glass.

They both do so.

MIRANDA
It's okay, now...

ROYD
I don't like this Miranda. It's too
obvious. This is dangerous.

MIRANDA
There's no other way. Royd, I know
what's happening.

ROYD

Always three moves ahead. I knew you
would.

74
ay

MIRANDA
Your ship is killing us Captain. Not
you. Please explain it to me.

ROYD
No. You're safer if you remain
ignorant. Just do as I tell you! All
of you zze in danger, but I can
protect you... if you let me!

EXT. OWL'S POD - NIGHT

Owl is hiding behind a large section of shattered huli.
Watching Miranda and Royd, he looks convinced of their
complicity. Bringing his pod around in a wide circle, he
vanishes behind the ship.

EXT. ROYD AND MIRANDA'S SLEDS ~ NIGHT

ROYD
You understand too much already. All
you. need to know is that the ship is
malfunctioning. You'll have to
trust me.

MIRANDA
Trust is a two way bond.

ROYD
Enough! We have repairs to make.
Let's see just how improved you
really are.

With that, he backs his pod up and moves towards the ship.

Ow] brings his pod alongside the ship, and manually opens

the airlock to the pod bay. He braces himself for what he
knows is within.

or

HIS POV ~ As the lock dilates, a shaft of light illuminates
the body of the headless telepath, still draped in the
bloody sheets.

CLOSE ON THE HEADLESS TELEPATH - It floats like a grisly
guardian, tethered loosely to a suppert beam by the door to
the inner lock. Somehow, it looks natural, as if it never
had a head at all.

CLOSE ON OWL - He looks away, but as if against his will,
his eyes keep returning to the corpse. The lock slides all
the way open and Owl rides his pod inside.

INT. NIGHTFLYER - AIRLOCK

Owl watches as the lock wedges back into place. As the
chamber repressurizes, the hissing air jets cause the
telepath's corpse te sway gently back and forth.

When the ready light comes on, Owl twists opens the inner
lock and moves into the ship's main corridor.

INT. MAIN CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Owl slips his helmet off and glances around. Unused to the
weightless, he moves clumsily through the corridor and
enters the lounge.

INT. NIGHTFLYER - LOUNGE

Owl pushes himself across the room, floating above the
furniture. He bangs into a chair, and bounds over the

conference table to the rear of the lounge.

Reaching the bulkhead separating the lounge from Royd's

cabin, Owl removes a small, laser torch from his back

pack. He switches it on, and aims the thin blue beam at the
bulkhead.

High up on the wall behind him, a video camera pans in his
direction.

on Owl's hand until the laser torch fills the screen.

INT. LOUNGE/CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

Owl smiles as the laser beam begins to cut through the
metal. Behind him the door to the lounge slides silently
open. Owl pauses, sensing the movement in his peripheral
vision.

Something cold and wet touches his face. He spins around but
sees nothing. A moment later it happens again, and this time
he sees it.

OWL'S POV - A cloudy blue eye which was surgically removed
from Jon the telepath, is floating in the air directly in
front of Owl's face.

Owl stares at it in revulsion then grabs it, throwing it
across the room. Shuddering. he switches the laser back on.
He is about to resume cutting when an arm grabs him around
his neck and jerks him away from the wail.

The laser flies out of Owl's hand. Owl whirls round to see
it grabbed by the headless corpse. It raises the laser and
turns it slowly toward owl.

ANGLE ON OWL - He screams in mortal terror.

We move up to a video camera on the opposite wall, aimed
down at him.

EXT. NIGHTFLYER OUTSIDE DAMAGED AIRLOCK; - NIGHT

Working with Miranda, Royd uses his pod's cybernetic arms

to weld a section of armor plating back onto the damaged
hull. He checks the weld.

77
ROYD
Done.

Just then they hear horrible, tortured cries in their
headsets.

MIRANDA
What the hell's that?

Royd's eyes go up to the ship's top sphere from which he
emerged earlier.

ROYD
Mother.

EXT. NIGHTFLYER; NEW ANGLE - NIGHT

Darryl and Audrey are on the other side of the ship in their
pod, towing some fragments of the hull, when they hear the
cries. ‘

DARRYL
It's Owl. Where the hell is he?

They look around and see that he's no longer with the
others. Audrey grabs his arm and points to where Owl's pod
is parked outside the airlock.

ANGLE ON ROYD AND MIRANDA - We can hear Audrey over the com
systen.

AUDREY (0.S.)
He went back in the ship. Let's go!

ROYD (0.S.)
I WARNED YOU ALL NOT TO GO BACK
WITHOUT ME!

AUDREY
Right...

78
oy

ANGLE ON AUDREY - She ejects the scraps of metal from off their
pod and activates the rockets, shooting them back towards
the Nightfiyer.

EXT. D'BRANIN'S POD; FARTHER OUT FROM THE SHIP - NIGHT

D'Branin is coming back towards the snip, towing a net filled
with hull fragments. Eliza, still heavily sedated, sits
peacefully beside hin.

HIS POV; Miranda and Royd are rising up out from the damaged
hold towards where Audrey and Darryl are waiting for the
lock to open.

D'BRANIN
Miranda! Where's Owl!?

We can see Miranda turning back to him.

; MIRANDA (in headset)
He went back in...

The voices overlap the screams from within the ship.

D'BRANIN'S POV - We see Royd and Miranda flying back in a
futile effort to intercept Darryl and Audrey.

ROYD (0.S.)
I beg you to listen! If your
colleague is in the ship alone, he
is dead.

AUDREY {(0.S.) .
How do you know? Did you kill him?

ROYD (0.58.}
NO! But I could've protected him
from the same fate. Please stop!

MIRANDA (0.S.)
Audrey, we have no way of knowing
what's happening in there... Don't
go in!

79
 

- AUDREY -(0.S.)
Puck off, Miranda!

DARRYL (0.S.)
If you want to help, Miranda, keep
Royd away from his goddam controls
until we can get Owl!

ROYD
Dr. D’Branin, they don't know what
they're doing. Please help me!

CLOSE ON D'BRANIN ~ He screams to them:

D'BRANIN
AUDREY, DO NOT GO IN THE SHIP!
THAT'S AN ORDER.

HIS POV - The airlock open wide enough for them to enter and
Darryl and Audrey fly through. It closes again by the time,
Roya and Miranda reach them.

ANGLE ON MIRANDA AND ROYD ~

MIRANDA
Royd, if you go in through your lock
and head for your cabin. I']1l try to
stop them.

We see Royd trying to activate some controls in his pod.
They seem to have no effect on the lock.

ROYD
It's toa late. The ship will not
respond to my controls.

MIRANDA
Why not?

ROYD
Because I'm being kept outside
until... until mother is done with
then.

80
INT. MAIN CORRIDOR OF SHIP - NIGHT

Darryl and Audrey are bounding down the hall towards the
ljounge where the cries seem to be emanating. Darryl flips
back his helmet and puts his ear to the door. The screams
sound louder now.

DARRYL
God! It's awful! He's in there...

He reaches out to press the panel which opens the lounge
door and Audrey grabs his arm.

AUDREY
Wait aminute! We might needa
weapon. How do we know there isn't
something in there with him?

DARRYL
There's one way to find out.

He slams the panel and bursts into the lounge.

INT. LOUNGE - NIGHT

Save for the light coming in from the corridor, the lounge
is dark and apparently empty. Audrey hesitates, watching him
from the doorway. Darryl whispers:

DARRYL
Owl... where are you?

He moves across the room, towards the kitchen.

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

Darryl Flips on the light finding himself in a room

with bright red globules of blood floating all over the
Place. He waves his hand through an especially large globule
and it disperses into hundreds of smaller bubbles.

ei
DARRYL
Charming.

He carefully avoids the cabinet containing the food

processor and open a drawer containing the kitchen
implements.

INT. LOUNGE - NIGHT

Audrey hesitantly enters the room, inching her way along
the wall. She passes the communicator and stops suddenly,
realizing that Owl's cries are coming from the speaker

grill.

AUDREY
No...

Audrey senses some movement behind her, and turns to see
the corpses of the headless telepath standing in front of
the wall-sized video screen.

INT. GALLEY - NIGHT

Darryl has just removed a large steak knife from a drawer
when we hear Audrey scream :

AUDREY (0.S.)
DARRYL, GET THE HELL OUT OF THERE!
INT. LOUNGE ~- NIGHT
The headless telepath slowly approaches Audrey.

AUDREY
DARRYL...

She bolts out of the lounge just as Darryl emerges from the

kitchen holding a large steak knife. He freezes, seeing the
corpse moving towards him.

82
—o~,

INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Audrey frantically bounds down the hall, crashing into the
walls in her panicked effort to escape. At the end of the
corridor, she pounds on the panel for the air lock. It opens
and she dives through.

INT. AIR LOCK - NIGHT

As the panel slides closed after her, she leans against it
panting for breath. Then, feeling guilty about having
abandoned Darryl, she pounds on the panel and it shoots open.

She peeks out, looking down the corridor.
HER POV: The corridor is empty and utterly still.

: AUDREY
Darryl! Darryl...

After a pause, Darryi's voice comes through a speaker in the
corridor.

DARRYL (0.5.)
Boy, talk about bravery in the face
of death...

Audrey winces with guilt, but at the same time is relieved.

AUDREY
Hey, I told you to get out of there!
Darryl... where are you?

DARRYL
I'm cleaning up after myseif,
unlike some people.

Audrey hesitantly steps into corridor and walks back down
towards the lounge.

83
EXT. SPACE OUTSIDE THE DAMAGED HOLD = NIGHT

Miranda and Royd have been joined by D'Branin and Eliza's pod
outside the damaged hold.

MIRANDA
Royd, you told us your mother died
~- before you were boii.

Within the pod's shield, Royd's expression is anguished.

ROYD
I have never lied to you.

MIRANDA
But you haven't told us the whole
story!

D'BRANIN

Royd, we've trusted you. You must
tell us why this is all happening!

Eliza moans as she breaks through her sedation.
ELIZA

It's her... ghost that's been

killing us.
Royd and Miranda look at one another and then at Royd. He
doesn't deny the explanation.
INT. LOUNGE - NIGHT
The lounge is dark, save for a slash of light coming from
the galley. The door to the lounge slides open and Audrey

cautiously peers in whispering:

AUDREY
Darryl...

There is no response.

84
ey

As Audrey starts backing away from the door, we hear
Darryl's voice coming from the lounge. He sounds hurt.

DARRYL (V.0.)
Dammit... Give me a hand, will you?

Audrey starts into the room then hesitates.

AUDREY
How do I know it's you?

There is a brief silence. Then we hear groaning noises.

DARRYL
Fine! Just let me bleed to death!
Just get the hell out!

Torn by guilt and anxiety, Audrey steps into the room, and
haltingly approaches the galiey.

AUDREY
I'm sorry... I'm sorry!

The door to the galley suddenly opens and we see Darryl is
laid out on the counter, obviously dead. The headless
telepath is standing before it. It's one hand gripped around
the handle of the steak knife, which is imbedded in Darryl's
chest. Darryl's voice comes over the com system softly
whispering:

DARRYL (0.S.)}
Too late...

Audrey screams and bounds cut of the room.

INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT
Hysterical and running for her life now, (as best as one can

in weightlessness,) Audrey head for the pod bay through
which she and Darryl entered the ship.

65
As she turns the corner, her helmet falls off the back her

Suit, but Audrey doesn't notice. She keeps on running until

she reaches the Pod Bay, where she pounds on the illuminated
Panel on the wall. The inner lock slowly opens and she runs
through.

INT. POD BAY - NIGHT

Audrey presses the panel to open the outer lock when she
realizes her helmet is gone. She looks back towards the
inner lock, but decides instead to head directly for her
pod. She bounds over to it and is about to get in, when we
hear the sound of the inner lock cycling open. Audrey
quickly ducks into the pod and closes the door.

INT. POD - NIGHT

Audrey holds her breath as the torso walks past the pod and
out of sight. After a pause, we hear the inner lock cycling
open again. Remaining hidden, Audrey reaches up to start the
pod's rocket, but as she does, the the door to pod is jerked
open. She is violently pulled out by the telepath's
remaining arm,

INT. POD BAY - NIGHT

In one smooth motion, the headless telepath smashes Audrey
against the wall to the pod bay, breaking her neck.

INT. ROYD'S CABIN - NIGHT

CLOSE ON THE OVAL MONITOR - We see the headless telepath,
opening the pod bay's outer airlock. It tosses Audrey's
torso out into space, away from where the others could see
at.

As the lock slowly closes, the image changes to a point of
view outside the Nightflyer where we see the pods of Royd,
Miranda, D'Branin and Eliza still hovering near the other
side of the ship.

86
EXT. SPACE OUTSIDE NIGHTFLYER - NIGHT

Royd is continuing with his explanation.

CLOSE ON ROYD

ROYD
My mother's spirit... or whatever
you chose to call it, resides in the
ship's computer. It has an organic,
erystal matrix core.

D'BRANIN
Esperstone?

~ He nods, somberly.

ROYD
Before my mother died, she
transferred her consciousness into
this core. She had shown signs of
instability in the past, but I see
now, that she's become truly mad.

MIRANDA
How is she doing it? I can
understand how she can open and
close an airlock, but what about
Jon?

ROYD
In life, mother had tremendous
Powers of telekenesis. They have
only become stronger...

D'BRANIN
And under weightlessness, her power
would he...

ROYD
Enormous. Yes. Gravity is her one
great limitation.

They turn to the epen lock of the drive room.

87
rONN

ROYD
They are all probably dead. And
knowing mother as Ido, I must tell
you that she could never allow you
to return to Avaion alive.

Miranda and D'Branin look at one another.

D'BRANIN
What about you, Royd? Aren't you in
any danger?

ROYD
If she believed I had deserted
her - that I had chosen to side with
you, then she would kill me too. I
would have to prove my allegiance. I
could kill you both, right now and
win my way back into Mother's good
graces.

He touches his pod's laser cannon. There is a long silence
as he looks into Miranda's eyes and then. atD'Branin.

MIRANDA
You could try, Captain... But I
caution you, the improved model is
not easy to kill.

CLOSE ON ROYD - He glances at the Nightflyer and then back
at Miranda. The decision is a painful one for him. Finally,
he take his hand from the pod's laser cannon.

ROYD
I would not kill you. I've lived for
39 years and I have never lived at
all. If we lose, we ali die
together. If we win, well, I shall
die anyway...

MIRANDA
Your mother lied to you, Royd! You
won't die without the ship!

86
~ om,

RoyYD
No matter. Death does not frighten -
me. .

MIRANDA
Is there any way to get back in?

Royd looks back at the ship.

ROYD
Through the drive room.

A low moan is heard over the headsets. It takes a moment for
the three of them to realize that it's coming from Eliza.

She begins struggling to free herself from her bonds. D'Branin
and Miranda kneel down to aid her.

Beneath the faceplate, Eliza's eyes flick rapidly back and
forth between Royd, Miranda and D'Branin.

D'BRANIN
Can you hear us? Are you allright?

ELIZA
The Volcryn...

D'BRANIN
Where?

She looks out into space and following her gaze, we see a
faint, colored glow of light in the distance.

This revelation is interrupted by an ominous, low-pitched
RUSHING noise coming from the Nightfiyer.

The three others look back at the ship to see another
glowing light in the direction of the Nightflyer; the glow
of of the fusion rings behind the drives.

ROYD

Hurry! The ship is preparing to
move!

89
He and Miranda start up the rockets on their pods, but
D'Branin hesitates, torn between kis dream, and his
allegiance to what's left of his team. Miranda turns to him:

: _ MIRANDA
I know what you're thinking. Go to
to then.

D'Branin's expression answers her question.

MIRANDA
Don't worry about us.

ROYD
Dr. D'Branin, you do understand that
my mother is about to move the ship.
If we're unable to stop her, you'll
be left behind.

D'BRANIN
I realizes that.

MIRANDA
Eliza, come with us!

Eliza shakes her head. She continues to stare out into space
toward the colored glow,

Miranda and D'Branin's eyes lock for a final time.

ROYD
We have no time left.

He pulls the throttle back on his pod and heads for the
open lock which leads into the drive room. Miranda starts up
her pod and passes him, entering the ship first.

INT. DRIVEROOM - NIGHT
Miranda's pod is leading the way down the long barrel of
the chamber when Royd pulls abreast of her, stiff and

menacing in his black, bulky armor. Side by side they sail
past the glowing, cylindrical stardrives.

90
--- ROYD
When we reach the inner lock, jump
on to my pod

The two pods slow as they approach the inner wall of the
driveroom. Miranda abandons her pod jumping on behind Royd
while he reaches out to cycle open the lock. As the door
open, they glide through into the lock chamber.

INT. LOCK CHAMBER - NIGHT
Royd turns back to Miranda as they proceed:
ROYD

Once the lock opens... it will
begin. Most of the ship's furnishing
are either built in or bolted into
piace but the things your crew
brought on board are not. Mother

will use then...

Royd lowers the pod. The grapplers make a metallic sound as
they touch the chamber floor.

The inner door opens and Royd applies the thrusters.

INT. INNER CORRIDOR ~ NIGHT

The first section of the corridor is empty and quiet.

As they reach the point where it curves off sharply, they
notice a long tube of some sort, suspended in the air before
them.

Royd's hands tighten on the laser weapon as they approach.

ROYD
What is..?

As the pod round the bend, the tube turns out to be a part
ef Darryl's lower intestinal tract.

91
Cut open from crotch to throat, he is suspended in midair by
his guts, which have been stretched out from floor to
ceiling in a grotesque parody of a spiders web.

MIRANDA
Oh, God...

ROYD
Forgive my lack of reverence, but
knowing mother as I do...

He raises the grapplers and applies the thrusters and builds
up speed, ramming the pod through the center of the web.
They burst through, spreading a fine mist of blood into the
air.

INT. ROYD'S CABIN - NIGHT

CLOSE ON THE OVAL MONITOR ~- Royd's pod is flying down the
corridor which leads up to the lounge. We hear Royd yelis to
Miranda:

ROYD
HOLD ON!

The pod crashes inte the door. The impact shatters it like
cardboard and carries them through into the lounge.

INT. LOUNGE - NIGHT

The pod scrapes along the floor slamming into the conference
table. Miranda is thrown to the floor. Before she can get to
her feet, the headless telepath is upon her, wielding the
large steak knife.

Royd fires his laser and slices the corpse into a number of

smaller pieces. The arm holding the knife continues after
Miranda.

92
Royd continues firing, slicing the hand from the arm, the
fingers from the hand until the knife is left to carry on
its work by itseif. It slashes wildly at Miranda and stabs
deeply into her shoulder, slicing through her suit.

MIRANDA
Damn!

She reaches out and grabs the knife. Examining the cut with
her other hand, she sees that the wound has drawn blood. She
stares at the wound and mentally stems the flow of.blood.

Miranda looks up to see Owl's laser torch flying through
the air towards Royd,

MIRANDA
ROYD! BEHIND You!

Royd turns, and the thin blue beam from the torch hits
him squarely in the chest. Royd returns fire, and the pod's
heavy-duty laser hits the pistol, melting it.

MIRANDA
Are you wounded?

ROYD
No. My suit is better armored than
yours and her laser was a low-
powered toy.

Royd activates the thrusters and moves the pod to where Owl
had begun to cut into the bulkhead earlier. He switches on
the pod's laser.

ROYD
We'll be through in five minutes or
less.

Miranda notices some movement in her peripheral vision and
turns to see a large, ornate mirror coming off the opposite

wall and flying through the air towards them.

Miranda quickly picks up a chair, smashing the mirror in
midair.

93
Almost simultaneously, the light fixture above the oval
table begins swinging around, faster and faster until it
breaks free and flies through the room towards them. Miranda
gives it the same treatment as the mirror.
ROYD
De you need help?
MIRANDA

Just keep on cutting. I'll try to
cover you.

ROYD
I'm through.

CLOSE ON THE BULKHEAD - The laser has burned a meter square
line into the metal.

Royd raises the grapplers and applies the thrusters,
crashing the sled into the bulkhead.

As it breaks through, a piercing blast cf sound comes over
the com system. Miranda doubles over in agony as she
struggles to shut sound on her headset.

Simultaneously, there is a violent explosion from within the
kitchen and the paneling bursts open, lashing utensils,
glasses, plates, knives, pieces of flesh and bones across
the room towards Royd at ballistic speeds. An electrical
outlet near Miranda shoots out a three foot long spark.
Miranda manages to shield herself behind a lounge chair and
the barrage bounces harmlessly off Royd's heavily armored
suit. .

Then time seems to slow as he steps off the sled and kneels,
crawling through the opening.

Miranda sees that the remains of the corpse are gliding
towards her once again. The utensils rise up off the ground
and begin flying at Miranda when the whole ship suddenly
lurches violently. Miranda is knocked back hard against the
wall.

94
Everything, including the corpses falls to the floor with a
loud crash. The biood, which was a mist in the air, falls to
the floor like rain, forming a sticky red coating over
everything. Miranda realizes that gravity has returned to
the Nightfiyer.

Royd's voice comes through the communicator grilis around
the xcum.

ROYD (V.0.)
I made it.

MIRANDA
I noticed.

ROYD (V.0.)

I've restored gravity with a manual
override and I'm cutting off as many
computer functions as possible.

INT. ROYD'S CABIN; CONTROL CONSOLE - NIGHT

Miranda's form is visible on the large monitor. We move back
to reveal Royd seated at the console. He labors to speak,
clearly suffering from the effects of gravity.

RovD
We're still far from safe. She's
trying to find a way around me even
now, and I cannot afford to overlook
anything.

In the monitor, Miranda can be seen rubbing her shoulder
where she smashed into the wall.

Royd uses the lightpen to zoom in for a closer look. We see
The impact has reopened the wound on Miranda's shoulder and
blood is oozing out faster than before.

ROYD

Miranda, your suit has been
breached. You're bleeding.

95
INT. LOUNGE =~ NIGHT
Miranda looks down and sees the blood.

MIRANDA
So I am...

RoyD
You must change into another suit
immediately! I cannot guarantee how
long I can keep the locks sealed.

MIRANDA
Allright.

She gets to her feet and is about to leave the lounge when
she notices a glow of light on the room's wali-sized screen.

MIRANDA
Royd, look at the screen.

HER POV - The View of space shows the colored glow which
D'Branin and Eliza saw earlier is getting brighter. Royd's
voice comes over the com systen.

ROYD (0.S.)
The Volcryn...

Miranda watches the screen a moment longer, then leaves the
lounge.
EXT. SPACE - NIGHT

D'Branin and Eliza's sled has moved out a great distance from
the Nightflyer which is still visible behind then.

CLOSE ON D'BRANIN AND ELIZA - The glowing, colored light is
absolutely brilliant. We see the Voleryn reflected in the
pod's glass bubble. D'Branin smiles, opening the thrusters all
the way. As they pass out of frame we DISSOLVE TO:

96
INT. ROYD'S CABIN - NIGHT

CLOSE ON THE OVAL MONITOR - Royd switches from the view of
space to one following Miranda. He anxiously watches her
progress down the corridor.

INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Royd's voice rings out through the communicators built into
the walls.

ROYD
When you've changed you'll have to
dump the corpses into the mass
conversion unit, then any other
loose objects that aren't...

MIRANDA
One thing at a time, Captain.

She opens the hatch just past the drive room and enters.

INT. CARGO HOLD #2 - NIGHT

Miranda rips off her breached suit and quickly slips into a
new one, repressurizing it.

MIRANDA
You were saying...

ROYD
Mother is still a threat. With the
gravity returned, she can only move
one object at atime but she could
still circumvent me at any time.

MIRANDA
Roger.

She leaves the hold.

37
roy

INT. GALLEY - NIGHT
The hum of the ship's engines is much louder in here.
Miranda lifts up the remains of Jon and Darryl's corpses and

dumps them into the conversion unit. The torsos and limbs
twitch under her touch.

INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Miranda walks down the curving silver corridor. The soles of
her boots click hollowly on the metal floor.

Sensing that she's being watched, she notices a video camera
panning with her.

MIRANDA
Royd...

The oniy sound is her breathing.

She stares directly into the lens then turns away abruptly
an continues down the tube.

INT. LOUNGE - NIGHT

The door to the lounge opens. Miranda hesitates in the
doorway.

MIRANDA
Royd... are you aliright?

Silence.
MIRANDA
Royd...
Royd's voice sounds strained as it comes through the

communicator:

ROYD
One moment... Yes.

98
As Miranda enters the lounge. we notice the door to a small
utility closet opening a crack.

POV FROM UTILITY CLOSET - We see Miranda standing quietly
watching and listening for any signs of movement.

CLOSE ON MIRANDA - she resumes gathering up the last of the
loose scrap materials and places them inside a bag.

Behind her, we see a knife rise silently up off the carpet.
It begins moving towards her and swiftly building up speed.

Miranda senses the movement and whirls round, grabbing it a
few inches from her face.

She is about to places it in the bag with the other scraps
when Owl suddenly falls out of the utility closet, falling
on her.

Miranda screams. She.is about to stab him with the knife
when she realizes that he's not moving any more. She turns

him over and we see where the laser has cut his throat.

MIRANDA
Oh, God...

Miranda closes her eyes and starts to cry.

INT. UTILITY ROOM - NIGHT
Miranda close the door to the mass conversion unit and is

about to leave the room when she notices Eliza's abandoned
medical kit. She picks it up and walks out to the corridor.

INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT
The ship jolts violently and Miranda is thrown to the

ground. Royd's voice cries can be heard erying eut in pain
over the com system.

99
Miranda's features contort as she is subjected to a
tremendous increase in gravitational force.
INT. CORRIDOR; NIGHTFLYER - NIGHT
Miranda manages to switch on her suit's com system.
MIRANDA
Royd, are you there? What's

happening?

Royd's voice come out painfully slowly:

ROYD (V.0.}
++ She tricked me... hurts... to
talk.

MIRANDA
Royd...

ROYD (V.0.)

She... teked... dial... up... two...
gees... three... higher... right
here... on... the... board... all...
I... have to... to do... turn it...
back... let me...

Silence.

INT. ROYD'S CABIN; CONTROL CONSOLE - NIGHT

Royd's hand attempts to reach eut for the dial on the board
but is unable to do sc. Miranda's prone form is visible on
one of the small monitors.

INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT

ROYD (V.0.)
o. Can't...

Miranda looks up at the camera mounted near the ceiling.

100
oat

MIRANDA
Why? Why would she turn up the...
gravity? It weakens her even more
than you...

ROYD (V.0.)
+. Yes... but... in a minute... my
heart... will burst... and then...
you alone... she ... will... kill
gravity... kill you... .

Miranda reaches out and begins dragging herself down the

‘corridor with Eliza's medical kit under her arn.

MIRANDA
Royd... hold on...

She opens the medical kit and searches through it locating a
crimson colored ampule.

CLOSE ON THE AMPULE - It is labeled Esperon.

Miranda takes it out of the bag.

INT. ROYD'S CABIN; CONTROL CONSOLE - NIGHT

With no intervention from Royd, Miranda's image is switched
to the central monitor.

MIRANDA (V.0.)
Royd... Your mother...

INT. CORRIDOR; NIGHTFLYER - NIGHT

Miranda is still lying on the floor struggling under the
heavy gravitational force. She fills the injection gun with
the esperon.

MIRANDA

+. Could she move anything... teke
it... in this high gravity..?

102
ot

ROYD (0.8.)
.- possible... if she concentrated
all her power... why?

MIRANDA
Because... ... someone... something
is cycling open the airlock.

Down the corridor, we hear the bass rumbling of the lock as
it slides open.

Miranda filis the injection gun with the ampule of Esperon.

Behind her the inner lock begins whistling as the air in the
corridor rushes out through it.

As the lock opens further, the noise builds up to a roar.
Miranda uses all of her strength and succeeds in filling the
injection gun. She presses it against a vein in her neck and
squeezes the trigger. It makes a loud “hiss” as the drug
floods her system.

The injection gun drops to the floor, and is sucked down the
corridor. Next comes the medical kit, and Miranda finds
herself being pulied along with it.

Then the drug takes effect and Miranda screams, pulling
herself into a fetal position.

CLOSE ON MIRANDA - Her eyes go up into her head

DISSOLVE To:

MIRANDA'S MIND'S EYE POV: THE BULKHEAD IN THE LOUNGE -
The wall seems to literally melt away, revealing the
interior of Royd's cabin. He can be seen slumped over the

console, breathing heavily. His hand rests near the control
for the gravity grid.

102
INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT
Miranda's body twitches reflexively as she concentrates.

KER MIND'S EYE POV: The lever for the gravity grid moves
slowly back down to the normal range.

BACK TO SCENE - With the gravity Lacs to normal, Miranda
reaches up to the railing and pulls herself to her feet.
Holding tight to the railing, she hurries over to the switch
on the wall, controlling the airlock. She hits it and the
lock closes.

INT. LOUNGE/CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

Miranda walks across the lounge towards the hole in the far
wall which leads into Royd's cabin. She crawls through.

INT. ROYD'S CABIN; - NIGHT

Miranda enters and finds Royd is still sprawled over the
control panel. She pulle him back into his seat and sees
that he's still breathing.

Her attention is taken by the lights blazing through the
large oval monitor.

HER POV; CLOSE ON THE SCREEN - The Voleryn fill the entire
field of view, as they move toward the ship. Delicate,
diaphanous, it appears as a vast, intricate kind of
spiderwebbed craft, alive with it's own lights. It moves,
with long, tendril-like veils which ripple like a cosmic Man
‘o War.

Miranda watches the screen for a moment, then quickly
searches the control console, until she finds the
intricately carved lightpen. She aims it at one of the icons
and flashes it.

A portion of bulkhead separating Royd's cabin from the

lounge swings silently open. She lifts Royd into her arms and
carries him out of the cabin.

INT. CORRIDOR APPROACHING POD BAY - NIGHT
Miranda hears a rumbling noise and looks behind her to see

the walls and the ceiling are beginning to collapse in
around her.

She runs down the hall, toward the pod bay, staying only
steps ahead of being crushed.
She presses the switch for the bay but nothing happens.

Miranda closes her eyes and concentrates on the inner
airlock.

CLOSE ON THE AIRLOCK - It literally bursts open as if
equipped with explosive bolts,

Miranda carries Royd through just as the entire corridor
collapses in on itself.

INT. POD BAY ~ NIGHT

Miranda carries Royd over to one of the escape pods and
opens the door. Just as she is about to lift him in, she is

startled by a voice from behind her.

MOTHER (0.S.)
You'll die, Royd.

Miranda turns around to see the pale, ghost-like figure of
Royd's mother floating in the air, behind then.

CLOSE ON THE MOTHER - She is Royd's identical female
counterpart.

ROYD
I'm sorry, Mother.

The Mother screams as Miranda helps him into the pod and
closes the door.

INT. POD - NIGHT

The walis of the pod bay begin to collapse as Miranda
remotely activates the controls which open the outer airlock.

Royd's mother's screams can be heard over the pod's intercom
as Miranda ignites the thrusters, sending the vehicle
crashing out through the airlock before it is even half-way
open.

CLOSE ON ROYD = He turns back to look at the ship through
the window.

HIS POV - The ghost of Royd's mother can be seen standing in
the gaping airlock, watching them leave.

EXT. SPACE OUTSIDE NIGHTFLYER

The pod gets several hundred meters away when the Voleryn
agweeps over the Nightflyer, absorbing it completely.

INT. POD - NIGHT

Miranda watches Royd as he views the destruction of the ship
through the window.

FADE TO:

EXT. SPACE APPROACHING AVALON ~ NIGHT

The pod is moving slowly through space, down toward a
familiar-looking, pale-biue satellite.

INT. POD ~ NIGHT

Royd and Miranda are concentrating intently on a holographic

chess board which floats between them. He looks stronger and
in better health than when he left the ship.

105
His rook takes Miranda's castle and it disappears from the
board.

MIRANDA
You're getting better, Royd.

ROYD
I think you're just getting tired of
winning.

Miranda laughs, taking his rook with her queen.

MIRANDA
Check.

He moves a pawn beside her queen.

ROYD
Checkmate.

Miranda stares incredulously.
ROYD
It's what happens when you study

with an improved model.

Miranda studies the board, still not believing that he’s
actually beaten her. She turns to him and smiles.

MIRANDA
Well, I don't want you to think I'm
only a good winner... but we have
one more game game to play.

She types a command which causes the chess set to disappear.

ROYD
I don't understand.

MIRANDA
T'lli explain it to you.

She puts her arms around Royd and kisses him. They separate
and he looks into her eyes.

Co ROYD
@ And they thought I was an artificial
Intelligence... .

He returns the kiss.

EXT. POD ~ NIGHT

The pod drifts slowly down toward the pale blue satellite.
