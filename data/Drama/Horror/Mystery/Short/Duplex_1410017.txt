KENNETH
When I told you I had a particular
building [etc.]
INT. BROWNSTONE - DAY 3
Real Estate Agent KENNETH, 40s, raspy voice, friendly
demeanor opens the back door, leading in a young couple,
NANCY and ALEX.
KENNETH
Butler’s pantry, the old
dumbwaiter...

Alex WHISPERS in Nancy’s ear.

ALEX
Remember what we talked about.

NANCY
I know. Poker face.

She nods, ‘I got it,’ and they move into...
THE KITCHEN/PANTRY AREA 4

Kenneth points out various features, not pushing too hard --
letting the place sell itself.

KENNETH
Built-ins, built-ins...

NANCY
Kitchen’s a little small.

She glances over to Alex who flashes a quick thumbs-up.

10/11/06 3rd Pink Revision 5.

KENNETH
Get rid of this awful divider, you
have an eat-in kitchen. Cozy
fireplace there.

A tiny-squeal escapes from Nancy. Alex mock-admonishes her
with an eyebrow.

KENNETH (CONT’D)
Original glass tiles in all the
fireplaces.

NANCY
Fireplace-es?

PORNOGRAPHIC CLOSE-UPS

A CARESSING PAN of the second fireplace, ornate woodwork,
wainscotting, gadrooning, etc.

KENNETH (0.S.)
Three. This one’s tiger-eye maple.
Notice the details, the
wainscotting, gadrooning, all
original...

ON ALEX AND NANCY
She's falling in love.
ALEX

Gadrooning?
THE BEDROOM 5
KENNETH
And over here you have your
library.

Kenneth gestures to an alcove of bookshelves.

ALEX
Wow.

Nancy playfully motions for him to play it cool.
ALEX (CONT'D)
(explaining to Kenneth)

I have a small collection of first
edition novels.

(CONTINUED )
10/11/06 3rd Pink Revision 6.

NANCY
Alex is a writer.

KENNETH
Oh, yeah. What kind of stuff?

ALEX

I wrote a novel you’ve probably
never heard of. “Crying in the
Sprinkler”

(Kenneth shrugs, doesn’t

know it)
It’s kind of a loosely
fictionalized memoir of my
childhood.

KENNETH
I’m not much for the coming of age
stuff. I love thrillers. Grisham,
Koontz. They scare the crap out of
me, but it’s like I’m addicted to
“Goose Bumps.” Let’s move on.

NANCY
Peacocks, lover!

PARLOR/LIVING ROOM 6
The living room is a sight to behold. Huge. Light flooding
in. A curved front window area looks out onto the tree-lined
street.

Nancy digs her fingers into Alex’s arm.

NANCY (CONT'D)

Oh my god.
Alex tries his best to act the level-headed buyer as he
notices... yet another hearth.
ALEX

I see, so there is a third
fireplace here in the living room.

KENNETH
And over there, you’ve got a little
outcropping, you could make it into
anything you want...
(to Alex)
-..a writer’s nook...

(CONTINUED )
10/11/06 3rd Pink Revision 7.

NANCY
A writer's nook! How perfect is
that?
(off Alex’s look)
I mean, if you like nooks.

Nearby, Alex notices something.

ALEX
Is this a staircase?

He points to a SPIRAL STAIRCASE camouflaged behind several
plants. Kenneth walks over.

KENNETH
Yeah. Oh, I thought you realized.
This is a duplex.

NANCY
(can’t contain herself)
A duplex?! As in two floors for
the price of one!

KENNETH
It’s right there on the listing
sheet.
Alex looks at the sheet in his hand. Sees it in tiny print.
ALEX
Why’s it sealed off? Were there a
slew of murders up there?

KENNETH
No, it’s a massage parlor.

Alex and Nancy are stunned.
KENNETH (CONT’D)
I’m just making fun. There's a
sweet old lady who lives
upstairs...
NANCY
(not thrilled)
A tenant?
INT. BROWNSTONE LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER 7

As they climb the stairs, Nancy caresses the bannisters.

(CONTINUED )
10/11/06 3rd Pink Revision 8.

ALEX
Rent-controlled means we can’t kick
her out, right?

NANCY
Alex!

KENNETH
It’s a legitimate question. You
can’t evict her. She has to decide
to leave or...god forbid... poor
thing hasn't been feeling well.
She must be a hundred years old.

Kenneth shakes his head, Nancy and Alex joining him. Now on
the landing, he knocks loudly on the door.

KENNETH (CONT'D)

Mrs. Connelly?

(to Alex and Nancy)
She's hard of hearing. It may take
her a little while to get to the
door.

(louder)
Mrs. Connelly?!

SFX: Many locks being opened.

Alex, Nancy and Kenneth wait, exchanging polite looks.
Finally, the door creaks open.

BEHIND THE DOOR

Peering out, is MRS. CONNELLY. She’s a tiny, frail lady ina
housecoat -- with her unblinking expression and lack of make-
up, at the moment, she resembles a corpse.

Her face flashes in recognition. She smiles sweetly and
speaks with a slight Irish brogue.

MRS. CONNELLY
Kenneth!

KENNETH
There’s my favorite girl! How are
you feeling today, Mrs. Connelly?

MRS. CONNELLY
I don’t feel good, Kenneth.

Nancy peeks over Kenneth’s shoulder into the apartment.

(CONTINUED )
10/11/06 3rd Pink Revision 9.

KENNETH
I’m sorry to hear that. I’ve
brought by a young couple, who
might want to buy the apartment.

Kenneth steps back to reveal Nancy on tip-toe; she drops down
quickly and interlocks arms with Alex.

NANCY
Good afternoon, Mrs. Connelly! I’m
Nancy Kendricks, and this is my
husband, Alex Rose.

ALEX
Hello.

NANCY
Do you mind if we look around?

NANCY'S POV

As Mrs. Connelly speaks, Nancy’s gaze drifts over her head.
She sees only a sliver of the apartment.

MRS. CONNELLY
Sorry, dear. I don’t feel up to it.
Nice to see you again, Kenneth.
The door CLOSES on Nancy’s face. We hear the door slowly
being LOCKED again. Then, we hear Mrs. Connelly coughing,
followed by a tiny squeak of sickly despair.

KENNETH
Poor dear.

EXT. BROWNSTONE - MOMENTS LATER 8
Alex and Nancy stand on the sidewalk with Kenneth.
KENNETH
I‘1l tell you right now, there’s a
lot of heat on this place.
(lowers his voice)

It’s gonna be off the market by

Monday. Adios.
Kenneth walks away. Alex And Nancy look around, at:
A YOUNG COUPLE walking along, in love.
A MOTHER, pushing a baby carriage.

CHILDREN, laughing in the playground across the street.

INT. NANCY AND ALEX'S EAST VILLAGE STUDIO - NIGHT Al10
It’s one room, tidy but crowded. Street noise filters in.

In a cheap IKEA bookshelf, there are several FIRST EDITIONS
of various classic novels.

Nancy, Alex, Coop and Celine finish their dinner served on a
dining room table a bit too large for the main studio room.

COOP
Three fireplaces! Guys, this place
sounds incredible.

NANCY
It is incredible! And,
surprisingly, kind of affordable.

ALEX
Well, kind of affordable. It’s
really at the higher end of our
range.

 

NANCY
It’s a little more than we wanted
to spend, but when you factor in
the duplex...

CELINE
It’s a duplex?

ALEX
Well it’s not exactly two

lives on the second...

older...Old. And her health is...

ALEX
I mean it’s Brooklyn, we weren't
even thinking of Brooklyn...

From the street, we hear a DRUNK DUDE yelling at a SQUEAKY-
VOICED TOUGH GUY.

(CONTINUED )
10/11/06 3rd Pink Revision 11.

DRUNK DUDE (0.S.)
I’m gonna kill the shit out of you.

SQUEAKY-VOICED TOUGH GUY (0.S.)
Say that to my face, ass-bag. Say
that to my freakin’ face.

DRUNK DUDE (0.S.)
I just said it to your face!

Coop looks to Alex, acknowledging the exchange outside.

COOP
Hey Alex, sometimes you just have
to “close your eyes and leap off
the precipice, unmoved by the
daunting growls of the rabid dog
named fear”.

NANCY
Wow. Who said that?

COOP

I did. I think!

(he chuckles, then gets

serious)
Look Alex, if I hadn’t taken the
leap from student to writer, a
detective named Don Piper would
still be locked up somewhere in my
imagination.

(to Celine)
Ooh, honey, did you bring it?

Celine reaches into her pocketbook, pulls out a copy of
Coop’s new book: “Murder on the Hudson: A Don Piper
Mystery”

COOP (CONT’D)
I wrote you guys a little
inscription. It hits bookstores
next week.

NANCY
Thank you, Coop.

COOP
(with false modesty)
I’m sure it’s not as brilliant as
your new book is going to be, but
there’s a couple of decent
metaphors in there.

CELINE
Oh, my gosh , Coop, we forgot to
tell them the big news.

NANCY
What is it?

CELINE
We're pregnant!

Celine stands up, revealing a belly-shirt with a stomach to
rival Britney Spears’. Nancy and Alex gaze at it in shock.

NANCY
Congratulations! You just found
out?

CELINE
(patting her impossibly
flat stomach)
No, I’m four months along! Isn’t
that exciting?!

notices something and gets up. As ALEX and NANCY exit, Nancy
hands a dollar to the Homeless Gentleman. (She hands out more

singles as she walks down the street)

NANCY
I think we should do it.

They pass an alleyway containing a SCRUFFY GENTLEMAN.

SCRUFFY GENTLEMAN
Smoke. Smoke.

ALEX
(re: scruffy gentleman)
What if we want to buy drugs? You
won't find this kind of convenience
in Brooklyn.

Nancy slaps Alex’s shoulder, playfully.

NANCY
We're not going to want to live
here once we start having babies.
(getting excited)
Oh, the upstairs parlor would make
the cutest playroom!

ALEX
I’m not sure I want Mrs. Connelly
coughing on my baby.

NANCY
(offhand)
You know what I mean. Once we have
the whole place.
Nancy preternaturally senses something and abruptly exits.

A PILE OF GARBAGE sits against the side of a building. Nancy
zeroes in on a barely visible object and pulls it out.

Nancy returns to Alex wielding her find triumphantly.

NANCY (CONT'D)
This’ll make a great lamp!

ALEX
It is a lamp.
NANCY
And it will be again!
(dreamily)

There are so many wonderful things
we could do with that apartment.

ALEX
I just wish I wasn’t so close to
finishing the book...

NANCY
(playfully selling)
What better place to finish that
novel than in your own, Nineteenth
Century oak writer’s nook!

ALEX
It is a good nook. And it’d be nice
to not have to write at Starbucks
with the other “novelists”...

NANCY
You deserve a nook of your own.

They have reached the subway stop. We hear a FAMILIAR RUMBLE.

NANCY (CONT'D)
My train.

Nancy kisses Alex. He smiles at her.

ALEX
Okay. Let’s do it.

He kisses her, more deeply. Behind them, a HOMELESS WOMAN
stands over a grate as the train rushes by underneath. The
air blows up her skirt; she holds down the skirt and enjoys
the breeze, though the effect is a little different than it
was in “Seven Year Itch.”

EXT. BROWNSTONE - DAY 12

A “MURRAY'S MOVERS” moving van is double-parked in the street
(the logo -- a smiling Hasid -- the motto: ‘We’ll take you

to the Promised Land’). Several muscular BLACK AND HISPANIC
MEN emerge from the van, carrying Alex and Nancy’s furniture.

INT. BROWNSTONE - DAY 13

-Alex and Nancy, in jeans and sweatshirts, remove stuff from
a box -- it’s belongings precisely labeled. As Alex unloads,
Nancy crosses off matching items on her CHECKLIST.

-Alex takes his rare books from a box, puts them on the A115
library shelves.

-MOVERS set a couch down in the living room. Holding anottticsr
FLOOR-PLAN, Nancy directs the movers to move the couch a foot
to the left. Smiles and nods when it’s in the perfect place.

-In the bedroom, Nancy consults a FLOOR-PLAN she’s made up 15
for the room -- hangs a large framed WEDDING PICTURE. The
newlyweds running through handfuls of rice.

INT. APARTMENT - LATE AFTERNOON 17
Considering they just moved in, almost everything is unpacked
and in place. The only problem -- the furniture looks highly
insignificant in the grandiose space.

ALEX
I could've sworn we had more stuff.

INT. BROWNSTONE - SECOND FLOOR LANDING - MOMENTS LATER 19

Nancy KNOCKS LOUDLY on Mrs. Connelly’s door. Alex examines
the bottle of wine. After a couple of seconds, Nancy knocks
EVEN MORE LOUDLY.

We hear the locks all OPEN, as laboriously as before.

INT. MRS. CONNELLY’S APARTMENT 20

The door CREAKS open to the end of the chain, and we again
see Mrs. Connelly’s suspicious eye. Only now it’s surrounded
by bright blue eye shadow.

NANCY
(a little loudly)
Mrs. Connelly? It’s Nancy and
Alex! From downstairs!

MRS. CONNELLY’S EYE (MOUTH O.C.)
Ohhhh. Oh!

She SLAMS the door. We hear the chain being UNHOOKED. She
opens the door again. Mrs. Connelly, wearing make-up usually
reserved for the wake, stands there in a red satin cheongsam
(that mandarin slip dress that was briefly popular 40 years
ago) covered with a tiny, pink sweater jacket.

MRS. CONNELLY
Come in! Come in!

NANCY
You have a lovely apartment, Mrs.
Connelly.

ALEX

(offering wine)
We got you a little housewarming
gift.

MRS. CONNELLY
(accepting bottle)
Oh, I don’t drink, dear. It’s a
sin. I’1l open it for you.

Mrs. Connelly goes off to the kitchen.
ALEX

Irish Catholics don’t drink.

Alex walks toward the bedroom as Nancy takes pictures
mentally redecorating.

ALEX (CONT'D)
What are you doing?

NANCY
Taking pictures...

Alex turns and sees
A WALL OF NAUTICAL PARAPHERNALIA

his gaze wanders down to a desk, on which is an ancient
harpoon sits.

ALEX

Is slightly taken aback. Then he laughs, and picks up the
harpoon.

ALEX
(turning)
Hey, Nancy...
Nancy turns.
ALEX (CONT'D)
(pirate voice)
Blow me down!

The harpoon goes off. It flies by Nancy’s head, missing it by
inches. It embeds in the wood trim behind her.

ALEX (CONT'D)
Oh God.

Alex rushes frantically to Nancy.

ALEX (CONT'D)
Are you all right?

NANCY
Yeah, I --
(turning)
Oh, God!

She rushes to where the harpoon is embedded. She freaks.

NANCY (CONT'D)
This is original trim!

10/11/06 3rd Pink Revision 17.

ALEX
It’s okay. We own it.

NANCY
(mortified)
I know!

MRS. CONNELLY (0.S.)
Just two secs!

Panicked, Alex yanks the harpoon out of the wood and
struggles to quickly jam it back into the gun. Nancy
meanwhile is trying to push together the wood to make the
gouge less noticeable. (It’s not that big and not in future
shots.) She licks her fingers and smooths the splinters down.

Alex rushes to the desk and lays the harpoon gun down, then
scurries back to sit on the couch. Nancy rushes in next to
him. They both sit there pretending nothing has happened.

Mrs. Connelly returns.

MRS. CONNELLY (0.C.) (CONT'D)
Here we go, sit yourselves down,
I’ve brought you something to
nibble on.

Mrs. Connelly places a black lacquer tray on the brass-plated
glass coffee table.

The tray features a Polynesian dancer, whose toplessness has
been strategically covered by a bowl full of Bugles™ anda

container of Onion Dip, half empty with numerous Bugle™
strafings in it.

ALEX
Wow, they still make Bugles™,

Mrs. Connelly holds a Bugle™ up to the cage. The bird
gently takes it by the tip, and rears its head back.

BIRD
Oh, boy!

That’s a great parrot you have

there.

NANCY
How are you feeling, Mrs. Connelly?
MRS. CONNELLY
Why do you ask, dear?
NANCY
Because the last time we saw you,

NANCY
Alex's first novel was published in
hardback and he’s about to hand in
his second one.

MRS. CONNELLY
What’s it about dear?

ALEX
I call it an urban epic. It’s
about three generations of a family
who own a printing press...

MRS. CONNELLY

(interrupting)
Very nice, let me refill that for
you.

(indicating the portrait

behind her)
Big Dick had the taste too, he was
a seaman. The drink took him from
me in 1963. We’d been married for
thirty-eight years.

Nancy and Alex are doing the math in their heads.

MRS. CONNELLY (CONT’D)

So now, tell me, when might you be
having children?

Alex finds this question a little forward; Nancy does not.

NANCY

NANCY
We've talked about two years.

ALEX

Ah, yes, quite a big family, at one

Oh, look at the time. It’s getting

Mrs. Connelly stands to lead them out. Nancy stands with
her, though not ready to leave. As Alex rises, a RUDE NOISE
emanates from his chair. Nancy looks at him askance.

MRS. CONNELLY (CONT'D)
Oh...

ALEX
It was the chair.

Nancy gives hima “let’s just drop it” look. Instead Alex
turns back to the chair and pumps it with his hand, trying to
get it to recreate the sound. He turns back to Nancy.

Alex prepares for a day of writing.

-He puts on music from a MINI-SYSTEM. He adjusts the volume,
first up then down.

-He opens the window a bit.
-He adjusts his chair.

He sits down -- it’s perfect. The music, the light, the

Good morning, Mrs. Connelly. Can I
help you?

Mrs. Connelly is holding the bottle of wine from last night.

MRS. CONNELLY
I wanted to give this back. I
won’t drink it and I thought you
might want it.

ALEX
Oh, well thank you very much. And
if there’s anything else I can do
for you, let me know.

Alex closes the door behind her. He notices the bottle is
almost empty. Smiles to himself as he takes a step towards
the kitchen and...

Alex swings around, opens the door.

MRS. CONNELLY
There is one thing.

INT. MRS. CONNELLY’S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - DAY 33
Alex stands in the claw-foot tub, listening to the wall.

ALEX
Sorry, I don’t hear any banging.

MRS. CONNELLY
It was very distinctive. The pipes
went bang-bang, bangety-bang-bang.

Bang-bang.

Alex presses his ear right up against the wall.

ALEX
Well, I’m not hearing any banging

Nancy is huddled around a FLAT-SCREEN MONITOR at a messy desk
with TARA, 20s, downtown vibe.

ON THE SCREEN -- there’s a layout of an article.

TARA
What do you think?
NANCY
It looks good, but maybe you

could...

(working the mouse, moving
things around on-screen)
...-lower the pull-quote and shrink
the picture by an eighth so you can

squeeze the text onto one page.

She neatens up the LAYOUT. It looks better.

Many are labelled, both to describe what it is “A WRITER'S

Nancy’s boss, HERMAN, enters. He’s a perpetually harried,
middle-aged man.

HERMAN (CONT'D)
Did you finish the Celebrity Scene

NANCY
Tickety boo.

HERMAN
I don’t know what that means.

NANCY
You’11 have it soon.

HERMAN
If you mean soon, say soon.

Several overstuffed garbage bags sit in the lobby, waiting to
be taken outside. As Alex, dirty and panting, hauls another
packed bag down the stairs, it breaks, refuse spilling all
over the steps.

Alex bends down, scooping the garbage back into the bag.
Without noticing, he picks something up, about to put it in
the bag when he realizes it’s a pair of RATTY BLOOMERS.

Just then, Mrs. Connelly walks out, with a small trash can.

MRS. CONNELLY
What are you doing with me drawers?

ALEX
(defensive)
What?! No-no, they were in the
trash.

MRS. CONNELLY
(mortified)
They most certainly were not. They
were... Oh, dear. Hand them back,

Several people mill under the eaves of the entrance, smoking.
One klatch consists of Nancy, Tara and TERRENCE, a co-worker.

Nancy does not need to be smoking as long the other are).

TERRENCE
So, when do we get to see this

It is a mansion, isn’t it? Oh my
God, are we insane?

TARA
Hey, as long as you can afford it.

NANCY
Barely. Not really. Oops.

Nancy giggles.

TARA
I wouldn't worry about it. I mean,
you are getting promoted to Deputy
Art Director.

Nancy pretends she has no idea what Tara is talking about.

TERRENCE
Everybody knows, Miss Kendricks.

TARA
And Alex's book will probably make
some money...

No. It’s all going to be flea

Behind Nancy, a particularly prickly Herman pushes through
the revolving door. He steps up to the three, demanding an
explanation with his petulant stance.

TARA
Hey, we’re smoking here!

HERMAN
I need “Fashion Finds” and “Street

Herman stalks back inside. The three share a lip-curling at

Fine. You know, Herman’s freaking

Were you napping?

ALEX
Um, no, I was just reorganizing my
book collection.

NANCY
So... how was the nook? Did you
write like a million pages today?

ALEX
No, more like five or six... words.

NANCY
What happened. It’s too sunny?

ALEX
No, our upstairs neighbor kept me
busy with chores most of the day.

NANCY
Really? Maybe you just have to set
some boundaries with her. Tell her
you're working, she’1l understand.

bang in some new copper piping. Nancy and Alex watch,

aghast.

I told your husband about the
problem this morning. The pipes
were going... bang-bang, bangety-
bang-bang... bang-bang.

MR. DZERZHINSKY
Very dangerous. Whole bathroom

This is for you.

Nancy hands Mrs. Connelly her card.
Alex stands, waiting for Nancy. He hears a RUDE NOISE O.S.

It’s Little Dickie. He stares at Alex. He makes another RUDE
NOISE.

Oh, Alex, before I forget, it’s the

Good morning, Alex.

ALEX
Good morning, Mrs. Connelly.

MRS. CONNELLY
Alex, I wondered if I could ask you
a quick question.

ALEX
Now, Mrs. Connelly, let me just
take a moment to explain my
situation to you. As you know, I’m
a writer, and I have a book
contract, and an editor, Jean, who
expects me to hand in my book in
the next three weeks.

MRS. CONNELLY
I see.

ALEX
Well, what that means is that,
during the day, even though it may
not seem like it, I’m actually at
work. It’s as if I'ma lawyer at a
law-firm. But instead of going to
an office, I work from home. So,
unless it’s an emergency, from 9 to
6, I’m not available. After that,
I'd be happy to help you with
whatever you want. Okay?

MRS. CONNELLY

I completely understand. And I
apologize for bothering you. It’s
just...

(pulls a copy of a BOOK

from a bag)
I bought your book yesterday, and I
wondered if you’d sign it. Of
course, if you’re too busy, I can
come back after business hours.

She hands Alex a copy of his novel, “Crying in the
Sprinkler.” Alex clearly feels guilty for being such a jerk.

ALEX
No, I'd be happy to sign it. You
didn’t have to buy it though, I
could've given you one.

MRS. CONNELLY
It was money well spent. Just
write something I’1l be able to
treasure for many years to come.

ALEX
Okay.

He opens the book, sees a sticker that reads: ‘99 Cents!’
Tries to ignore that, as he inscribes the book.

ALEX (CONT'D)
There you go. I hope you enjoy it.

MRS. CONNELLY
I know I will. Good day.

As she gets to the door, she turns around.

MRS. CONNELLY (CONT'D)
Oh, Alex, I know we just had this
discussion, but, well, I was
wondering if the firm of Rose and
Rose might accompany an old lady to
the pharmacy. It’s raining like
the Devil’s dew drops out there and
I need to renew my monthlies.
Won’t take any time at all.

Heavens no. It’s next Friday.
We've got a big week of practice

Officer Dan re-gains his attention.

OFFICER DAN
You had no right entering in the

could press charges if you want to.

ALEX
What?!

MRS. CONNELLY
Oh, no, I don’t want to do that.
They're such a nice couple.

Goodnight, now.

As the door closes, Officer Dan turns back to Alex and Nancy.

OFFICER DAN

You got off easy this time, but
I‘1l be watching you two very

He hands Alex the citation. Chick and Ginger exit Alex and
Nancy’s apartment, Chick motioning for Ginger to wait while

Oh... my... god...

WE PUNCH in on various images on the page:

Alex at his nook, writing (the caption: ‘Great American
Novel!'); Alex and Nancy in bed, cuddling; in the kitchen,
cooking (the caption reading ‘Yum!’). ]

Further down the page, Nancy’s vision for Mrs. Connelly’s
place.

Alex and Nancy with a baby in a nursery (Mrs. Connelly’s
parlor); Alex, in a home-gym (her bedroom), lifting a
barbell like a strongman; Alex and Nancy sit in an antique
bathtub, Nancy loofah-ing Alex’s back. An arrow points to
Alex (the caption, ‘Alex!’); a second arrow points towards
his crotch (the caption reads: ‘Mr. Peabody!’)

singing “She Moved Through The Fair” plays loudly.

Till our wedding day... till our
wedding day... till our wedding

He looks over to the house-keys in a bowl near the front
door. Then, his eyes go his desk, where he sees the $3,000
fine for trespassing.

Alex grabs a broom, using it to BANG on the ceiling several
times. Plaster falls, hitting him on the face.

And he momentarily FREAKS-OUT, spastically punching the air
in anger and frustration.

EXT. THE BROWNSTONE - LATER IN THE DAY 104

Nancy exits a cab with several BOXES of her office
possessions. At the same time, Mrs. Connelly returns,
stopping Nancy as she walks up the steps.

MRS. CONNELLY
Good evening, Nancy! I left a small
grocery list on your tape recording
at work. Did you manage to fill it
for me?

NANCY

apologetic)
No, I-
Mrs. Connelly turns away, a little peevish.

He quickly opens his eyes. Sees her dragging in her boxes.

NANCY (CONT'D)
You can’t sleep! You have to

It’s the leavings of a mouse.

NANCY

No, I can’t. I tried to warn you,
Alex. We’re canceling every

ALEX
In breach.

EXT. MIDTOWN — CONTINUOUS

Nancy and Tara, in coats and hats, exit a deli which has
various Thanksgiving decorations in its windows; Tara is
carrying a plastic bag with the lunch she has just bought.

TARA
In a way, you’re lucky. Herman has
been a superdick since you left.

They begin walking down the street, past mostly successful
people. Perhaps they pass a book store that is plastered with
posters for Coop’s latest book.

NANCY
Lucky? I can’t find a job, I’m
going to lose my apartment, my

there are several EMPTY SEATS next to one VERY SICK-LOOKING

Alex stares at the guy, who’s coughing, sneezing, shaking his

The Businessman coughs. Alex leans in to breathe from it.

The Businessman SNEEZES. Alex swings his face through the

MRS. CONNELLY
I did. That lovely black woman
from the Post Office brought me a

Wasn’t that sweet of her.

Alex smiles at her, rubs his sniffling nose, then, runs that
same hand over her armchair.

MRS. CONNELLY
But I’m afraid some of the carcass
didn’t go down the disposal.
Nancy and Alex suddenly look concerned.

That’s ‘cause you don’t have a

Ales lies under the sink, inexpertly struggling to loosen the
elbow joint. Nancy is above the sink, looking down.

piece of GELATINOUS FAT lodged in the pipe.

He takes the handle of a wire brush and jabs at the gristle.

Have you ever met this Mrs.
Connelly?

NANCY

Okay, well maybe we’ll have to beg

Alex and Nancy blink, from the flash and in disbelief. Alex
turns his head down as he blinks and sees...

page Alex inscribed to Mrs. Connelly, “To my favorite
upstairs neighbor...” In that moment, bird shit lands on it.

We're willing to pay you.
Something.

In installments.

MRS. CONNELLY
You want me to leave?

Don’t you want to be with people
who are more... in your

In beautiful, sunny Miami Beach?

MRS. CONNELLY
I’m Irish, dear. I'd sizzle up like

Then how about the Bronx? It’s
loaded with Irish people. Right off
the boat.

NANCY
Gobs and gobs of them.

Oh, you wouldn’t catch me in the

Alex does a leprechaun bounce of the head, then realizes he’s
embarrassing himself and stops. He and Nancy look forlorn.

MRS. CONNELLY
Well, now, there’s a thought...

Nancy and Alex are initially more shocked than pleased.

MRS. CONNELLY (CONT’D)
(thinking it through)
I haven't been back home in fifty
years... But I do still have the
old family cottage in Connemara.

With her eyes she indicates a painting/photograph on the wall
of what might more properly be called a manor house.

Alex and Nancy regroup and go for the sale.

NANCY
Ireland is so beautiful. Green.

ALEX
And they're in the EU now...

Nancy gives Alex a look. He shrugs. Mrs. Connelly nods her
head, smiling...

MRS. CONNELLY
Well, I'd have to give it some
thought...

Ooh, a caramel!

Mrs. Connelly pops the chocolate in her mouth.

Mrs. Connelly’s mouth is open as she mulls. Her tongue slowly
circumnavigates the chocolate.

Alex and Nancy are on the edge of their seats, their
excitement tempered by revulsion.

Mrs. Connelly snaps her mouth shut and nods happily. She’s
made up her mind.

MRS. CONNELLY

You know, I’ve got half a mind to--
Mrs. Connelly suddenly stops talking.

Heimlich’s her violently, several times. The chocolate flies
out.

Relieved, Alex relaxes his grip on Mrs. Connelly. She
instantly drops out of frame. We hear a DEAD THUMP.

Nancy drops to Mrs. Connelly’s side, feels her neck pulse.

Oh, God!

ALEX

Alex slams his fist down on Mrs. Connelly chest, like he’s
seen on TV.

mouth and blows in. He comes up for breath, starts to blow
again. Mrs. Connelly eyes snap open. He backs off, startled.

MRS. CONNELLY
What are you doing?

Mrs. Connelly’s POV

Alex is at a loss for words. His mouth is also smeared with
lipstick.

She looks down. Nancy is straddling her and has her hands on
Mrs. Connelly’s breasts.

Nancy looks to Alex alarmed. He starts to try to protest, but
Officer Dan redirects Alex’s attention with a jerk of his
face.

Alex!

Alex turns to see
NANCY
standing next to a beat up car being driven by a GUN DEALER.

NANCY (CONT'D)
I found us a... Un-gay.

Nancy makes a gun shape with her hand. The Gun Dealer rolls
his eyes.

DISSOLVE TO:
LATER
Alex and Nancy stand with the Gun Dealer behind the car. They
both look very nervous. The dealer pops the trunk; it’s
loaded with guns. Nancy’s eyes widen.
GUN DEALER
(suspicious)

You two aren’t going on some kind
of wild sex-murder spree, are you?

(CONTINUED )
10/11/06 3rd Pink Revision 89.

ALEX
No, no, nothing like that.
(beat)
Do we look like the kind of people
who would go on a spree?

GUN DEALER
You look a little crazy, yes.

NANCY
We've been under a lot of stress.

Alex points into the trunk.

ALEX
How about that?

It’s a 44-Magnum, the most powerful handgun on earth.

GUN DEALER
(derisive smile)
Yeah. That’s a little too much gun
for you. Here we go.
(displaying gun)
Black Widow, your basic 22-caliber
revolver. Five hundred dollars.

NANCY
It cost half that on the Web!

The gun dealer nonchalantly slams the trunk closed.

ALEX
Five hundred’s fine. Cash, right?

The dealer gives him a “what do you think,” stare. Alex
counts out almost all of his money and hands it over.

GUN DEALER
Thanks. One last thing: I’m a cop.

Alex and Nancy lose it, crumbling to the ground.

NANCY
Oh, no!

ALEX
You don’t understand, we’ve haven’t
slept in months! She killed my
computer! She crippled my wife!

The gun dealer cracks a smile.

GUN DEALER
Just fucking with you.

Nancy and Alex get back up, trying to regain their dignity.

GUN DEALER (CONT'D)

(very matter-of-fact)
Okay, now I just gotta give you my
standard rap: if you end up in the
legal system, and there’s even a
suggestion I might have been
involved, you are dead, your
children are dead.

Alex and Nancy get up, SNIFFLING.
ALEX
We don’t have any children.
(puts arm around Nancy)
We're trying.
The gun dealer starts to get in his car.

GUN DEALER
Yeah, well good luck with that.

NANCY
Thank you.

GUN DEALER
Don’t shoot anybody I wouldn’t
shoot.
The dealer peels out, spitting garbage at Alex and Nancy.

CUT TO BLACK

EXT. PARK SLOPE HOSPITAL — NIGHT

INT. HOSPITAL — EMERGENCY ROOM — CONTINUOUS

Nancy sits by Alex’s side, tightly holding his left hand, on
a small hospital bed surrounded by a curtained partition.
Alex’s right hand is bandaged. A hot, young female resident,
DR. KANG, nonchalantly briefs him.

DR. KANG
You were very lucky. Your hand
deflected the bullet into the soft
tissue of your groin. No major
organs were damaged.

ALEX
(incredulous)
What are--? It went into my--

DR. KANG
Yes, but it went straight through
the meatus. I’ve seen piercings
that were worse.
(dark chuckle)
A lot worse.

NANCY
(worried)
But what about... The other
things... Down there.

DR. KANG

They were unharmed.

NANCY
So we'll still be able to have
children?

DR. KANG

One way or another.

Oh, thank God.

Alex shoots Nancy a look.

NANCY (CONT'D)
(again concerned)

So how long will he have to stay in

the hospital?

DR. KANG

(to Alex)
Oh, you can leave any time.

(marking her chart)
I’m going to prescribe an
antibiotic, keep the bandages
fresh, and if there’s any pain, a
couple of Advil should take care of
it.

ALEX
(perplexed)
Don’t I need, I don’t know,
physical therapy or something?

DR. KANG
(smile, eyebrow raise)
No, just, well, you should probably
keep you hands off it for awhile.
(smiling, to Nancy)
Both of you.

Dr. Kang ducks out. Nancy looks at Alex apologetically.

NANCY
Poor Mr. Peabody...

ALEX
(forgiving her)
He took one for the team.

Officer Dan pops in from behind the curtain.

OFFICER DAN

NANCY
It was an accident!

OFFICER DAN
It’s been my experience that wives
do not accidentally shoot their
husbands in the penis. And as much
as this particular man may deserved
it, spousal abuse is a very serious
crime in this state. Now, you two
have a good night now...

Officer Dan exits. Nancy looks worried, but then Alex’s
smiling comforts her.

ALEX
He thinks you’re abusing me. Well,
you did shoot me.

NANCY
(worried)
Oh, honey, I just feel like we’re
approaching this whole murder thing
the wrong way.

ALEX

his bandaged hand)
Ya think?!

She gently strokes his wounded hand.

Connelly.

ALEX
Where is she?

NANCY
Maybe she’s in her chair...

IN THE LIVING ROOM D216
Alex and Nancy sneak around, their eyes landing on...
THE CHAIR

It’s empty. Then something lights up in the darkness behind
it. A match being lit. The flame hovers in the air. After a
moment, the red tip of a cigarette glows, illuminating two
disembodied eyes, staring sternly.

ALEX
(quietly)
Ah!

MRS. CONNELLY
You caught me. I can’t help but
sneak a fag once in a blue moon.

NANCY
(thinking quickly)
Mrs. Connelly, we thought you might
be cold, so we brought you an extra
pillow.

Nancy offers the pillow to Mrs. Connelly, who stands up,
edging towards them.

MRS. CONNELLY
Oh, you're so considerate. So
unlike the rest of the landlords.

Mrs. Connelly takes the pillow, then begins leading them away

It’s a HUGE WIDE-SCREEN PLASMA TV. Neither of them can
believe it.

MRS. CONNELLY (CONT’D)
And he hung these two noise-boxes

They turn their heads -- the woman’s got SURROUND-SOUND.
Mrs. Connelly pushes them down the hallway.
MRS. CONNELLY (CONT’D)
Oh, it’s gonna be so wonderful

Officer Dan. We’re going to be
one, big happy family.
They're now at the entrance to the dumbwaiter.
MRS. CONNELLY (CONT’D)

There’s a large piece of SCAFFOLDING with a tarped-in E216
platform under the ceiling hole. Alex and Nancy lie in bed.

ALEX
That was...without question, the
weirdest seven minutes of my life.
Then, from above they hear: CLAP-CLAP.
And suddenly, in SURROUND SOUND, “The Perfect Storm” begins
to play -- music pounding, Clooney and Wahlberg screaming
over the roaring sea.

The entire bedroom is shaking. Vases fall. Alex’s RARE F216
BOOKS plummet from the library shelves.

Alex's eyes land on the “Ass Patrol” DVD.

Nancy reluctantly hands Alex “Ass Patrol.”

Alex stands in the back, listening.

Piper grabbed the leash of the only
partner he’d ever known, and the
private eye and his trusty Jack

Mrs. Connelly drops the gun, kicks the knife aside with her
foot, and adopts a classic bare-knuckled fighter’s stance.

Mrs. Connelly rabbit-punches, ducks, weaves, does a 360 and
comes back with a roundhouse punch to Chick’s chest.

saying goodbye.

Kenneth grabs Nancy’s hand and starts to lead her up the
stairs. Alex follows. He gets up a couple of steps, then
thinks of something. He walks back down the steps and talks
to Mr. Gunther.

ALEX
Could you hold this for me?

He hands Mr. Gunther the envelope, and bounds up the steps to
where Nancy is holding open the door.

Mr. Gunther looks at the envelope. Handwritten across the
front in large block letters, it reads, “DUPLEX.”

INT. MRS. CONNELLY’S APARTMENT - DAY
Kenneth leads Nancy and Alex into the apartment. It’s been
perfectly redone. Little Dick sits on his perch. They
slowly approach Mrs. Connelly.
KENNETH
Mrs. Connelly? I brought you a
surprise!
No response.
KENNETH (CONT'D)
(louder)
Mrs. Connelly!
Nancy and Alex smile knowingly.
ON MRS. CONNELLY
Her eyes are closed.
KENNETH (CONT'D)
(even louder)
Dear-heart, wake up, I brought
company.
ON NANCY AND ALEX -- curious now.

Kenneth leans over, gives Mrs. Connelly a light tap on the
cheek.

KENNETH (CONT'D)
Mrs. Connelly?

He shakes her a little harder.

KENNETH (CONT'D)
She’s stiff as a board...

NANCY
No, She’s just hard of hearing!
Mrs. Connelly!

Nancy CLAPS TWICE -- Mrs. Connelly remains frozen, but the TV
turns on, Hawaii Five-O blasting through the speakers.

Kenneth feels Mrs. Connelly’s pulse.

KENNETH
(turns to Alex and Nancy)
She's dead!
Nancy and Alex look totally dumbfounded and fucked.
CUT TO BLACK
A BEAT
EXT. BROWNSTONE — DAY

INT. MRS. CONNELLY’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

113.

ON KENNETH -- he sets the three places at the dining table.

KENNETH
You had to see their faces when I
said she was a goner. I swear, I
thought they were gonna pass out
right on the spot.

WIDER -- we now see he’s talking to Officer Dan, dressed in a
sweater and slacks -- he ties napkins into decorative knots.
OFFICER DAN
Oh, sweetie, I wish I could’ve been
there.

A healthy looking Mrs. Connelly enters, setting down a

casserole dish. They all sit around the table.

MRS. CONNELLY
Trust me, it wasn’t easy holding my
breath all that time. Next time I
want a bigger cut of your
commission, Kenny.

KENNETH

What are you talking about? We
give you everything, Ma.

(puts his hand over

Officer Dan’s)
Danny and I barely have enough left
over for a little cruise to the
Carribean.

MRS. CONNELLY
I’m the one puttin’ my caboose on
the line.

10/11/06 3rd Pink Revision 114.

KENNETH
Come on, you had it easy with Alex
and Nancy. And you’1l have the
Friedman's out of here in a month.
The husband’s got a sleep disorder.

MRS. CONNELLY
Oh, goodie.

OFFICER DAN
It can’t be any tougher than those
last folks.

MRS. CONNELLY
Oh, they were a nice couple. Just
a little bit over their heads.
(vaising her glass)
To Alan and Nancy.

KENNETH
Alan and Nancy...

We freeze on the photo of Alex and Nancy. It’s the one Mrs.
Connelly took of them when they tried to buy her out. They
are in total shock.

MATCH DISSOLVE:
THEIR SIMILARLY SHOCKED FACES

PULL OUT:
EXT. PROSPECT PARK - DAY - LATER
Alex and Nancy walk in shock down a quiet path that would
normally be considered a beautiful place to take a stroll.
Spotting a bench, they sit down.
The couple sit there silently for a beat.

Nancy gets a sad look.

NANCY
She was so full of life!

Another beat. A bird chirps, a squirrel hops by. The city
skyline can be seen behind them.

ALEX
You know, we had our differences,
but that old lady was...
(searching)
...Scrappy.

(CONTINUED )
A beat.

10/11/06 3rd Pink Revision 115.

NANCY
She taught us a lot. About
ourselves.

ALEX
That when it comes right down to
it, we’re not cold-blooded killers.

NANCY
I feel pretty good about that.

ALEX
Me, too.

ALEX (CONT'D)
I’m going to dedicate my book to
Mrs. Connelly.

NANCY
She did inspire you to write it.

Nancy puts her hand on her stomach.

A beat.

NANCY (CONT'D)
Do you think, maybe, we should name
the baby after her?

ALEX
Maybe. Yeah, that would be... nice.

NANCY
What’s her first name?

ALEX
(realizing)
I don’t know.

Alex puts his arm around Nancy. They look up. We PULL OUT to
a beautiful cityscape.

MUSIC: “He Moved Through the Fair” by Sinead O’Connor.

A CHYRON SCROLLS UP THE SCREEN:

Alex's Novel,
“My Favorite Upstairs Neighbor,”

(CONTINUED )
10/11/06 3rd Pink Revision

was published that summer.
It sold poorly.

However, Miramax bought
the rights for a nice sum.
They changed the title.

That August, Nancy had a
healthy, ten-pound baby boy.
They named him Connelly.

Mrs. Connelly lived another 62 years.

116.
