--Stephen King
ON A HUGE PRINTING PRESS ,
high-tech mechanical nightmare. Hundreds of moving parts

wLAMMING together in furious synchronization. DEAFENING,
and hypnotic.
CLOSE ON THE PRESS
Kicking out paperback book covers, one after another. Dozen
after dozen.
ON THE COVERS
as they're automatically stacked. We can read the embossed
front cover. An eye-catching graphic of a black church
against a cloudy sky, above which read the words, "THE
HOBB'S END HORROR, by SUTTER CANE."
ON THE BACK COVERS —
as they kick out of a different press. They all promise but
one thing. "COMING SOON FROM SUTTER CANE - ‘IN THE MOUTH OF
MADNESS.'" Over and over again.

cur TO:
Eat. NOW TORK FACILITY FOR THE CRIMINALLY INSANE - NIGHT
It's raining, HARD. Thunder BOOMS as an occasional flash of
lighting reveals disturbing glimpses of the structure's
oppressive steel and concrete facade. An AMBULANCE, SIREN
BLARING, tears up the road towards the entrance.

CcuT TO:
INT. MAXIMUM SECURITY WING, NURSE'S STATION = NIGHT
A lone NURSE crouches over the night's reports. A MURMURING
beyond her ward's double doors suddenly catches her
attention. SOFT at first, it grows LOUDER as its source
approaches.
It's a VOICE. A man's VOICE.

A SCREAMING VOICE.

ee
ON THE DOORS

a chey EXPLODE INWARD. The nurse is startled as three
struggling figures pile in front of her desk. Two huge
GUARDS are dragging a fighting, frenzied MAN to his final
destination. The man is tied up in a straight-jacket and
has his face covered ina bizarre combination of mask and
muzzle. Spit flies from the nask's airhole as the man
SCREAMS.

Guard #1 SLAMS some papers down on the nurse's desk.

GUARD #1
(to nurse)
Trent, John J. He's---

The man suddenly goes berserk and sends a hard kick to
Guard #i's groin. The man starts to run off.

GUARD #2
Where you going fucko?

Guard #2 clotheslines the man and bounces his head off the
desk. Guard #41 recovers and slides the papers back towards
the nurse. The nurse takes a long look at the man,. who's
«till stunned. :

NURSE
(to guards)
Take him to number nine.
She leans over her desk and watches as the guards drag the
man off down a long corridor.

ON THE CORRIDOR

Each side is lined with cell doors. Each door features a
small, barred window. The guards drag the man to the last
cell at the end of the corridor. The man starts to come
around as Guard #1 produces a huge, RATTLING keychain and
unlocks the cell door.

ON THE MAN

as: his head stirs and we see his eyes focus on what's in
front of hin.
ON THE CELL

as the door CREAKS open. A grim, yellowed padded affair. A

as he starts to shake. The guards notice.

GUARD #1
Uh-oh.

GUARD #2
Get him in.

MAN

(letting loose)
NOOOOO0O!!{ NOT MEEEEEE!!!1

He grips the sides of the cell door as they try to force
him in. They finally succeed as the man goes flying
forward, RIPPING a piece of the door frame off with him.
Guard #1 pulls off the mask as the man goes in, then SLAMS
the door behind hin.

CN THE CENTER WINDOW

as the man's face comes SMASHING UP against the bars. We
wee it for the first time. It belongs to JOHN TRENT. A face
aged beyond its thirty-four years by sheer, stark terror.
Jet black hair hangs in sweaty clumps around his forehead.
Dried spit decorates his chin. Tears stream from his icy
blue eyes. :

TRENT
WAITII! HEY!!! SORRY ABOUT THE
BALLS!!! IT WAS A LUCKY
SHOTI!!

ON THE GUARDS

as they ignore Trent and walk away, nodding goodnight to
the nurse as they go.

Patients in the surrounding cells begin to join in,

HE'S NOT!!! - IT WAS ALL A
MISTAKE!!! = OH YES!!!

ON THE NURSE

Agitated at the NOISE. She flips a switch on a centrol
panel and LIGHT MUZAK begins to filter into the cells.

ON THE CORRIDOR

as it FILLS with the MUZAK. The patients quickly QUIET DOWN
as the light muzak version of "SATISFACTION" PIPES out over
hidden speakers. .

cUuT TO:
INT. TRENT'S CELL - NIGHT

Trent sinks slowly down the side of his door as the other
patients begin to SOFTLY SING ALONG with the MUZAK. A
demented lullaby. .

OTHER PATIENTS (0.S.)
-»-he can't be a man ‘cause he
doesn't smoke, the sane
cigarettes as me...

Trent listens for a moment, then runs his hands through his
hair. Hangs his head. Total despair.

(beat)
God...not the Stones too... ;
INT. YARBROUGH'S OFFICE ~ NEXT DAY

YARBROUGH, the facility's director, nervously watches DR.
WRENN read Trent's file. Wrenn is a tall, thin man in his

_ late forties. Yarbrough is a short fat man in his late
fifties. Yarbrough fidgets as Wrenn reads. We notice a
government I.D.. card pinned to Wrenn's shirt:

WRENN
{reading to
himself)
Admitted last night.
YARBROUGH
Yes...during the storm.
(beat)
How did you get here so fast?
WRENN
(snaps the file
shut)

We've been monitoring all .
admissions through police and
paramedic channels. This one
fit the symptoms.

-_ ¥ARBROUGH
(uncomfortable)

You think he's one of...then?
"WRENN
(rises, smiles)

That's what I'm hera to find
out.

Wrenn SNAPS the file shut and starts walking towards the
door, Yarbrough follows. He stops Wrenn before they exit.

YARBROUGH
(nervous)
Things must be pretty bad out
there, to bring in you
fellows.

Wrenn just stares at him, refusing to offer the reassurance
that Yarbrough seems to crave so deeply.

WRENN
(beat, thin
snile)
Take me to him.
INT. MAXIMUM SECURITY WING CORRIDOR - DAy '
Wrenn and Yarbrough walk towards Trent's cell.

WRENN
Has he made any requests?

YARBROUGH
Just one. Nothing dangerous. A
single black crayon.

Wrenn considers this, then he notices the MUZAK. This time
it's "YELLOW SUBMARINE."

PATIENTS (0.S.)
(softly)
++-@ yellow submarine, a
yellow submarine...

Yarbrough notices Wrenn's reaction.

YARBROUGH
They seem to like it. Classics
especially.

. WRENN
Of course.

They arrive at Trent's cell. Yarbrough unlocks it. He opens
the aocr. Roth men react to the sight before then.

cur TO:
INT. TRENT'S CELL - DAY

The entire cell is covered in crudely sketched crosses.
There are crosses on the walls, the floor, the ceiling,
everywhere. The bed, the chair, even the bed frame. Hunched
in one corner, putting the last cross in the last bit of
space with the last piece of whittled crayon, is John
Trent. He's free from the straight-jacket.

Wrenn motions Yarbrough to leave, then lays a clean
handkerchief down on the Crayon covered chair and sits
down.

John...?

TRENT
(without turning
around)
Hang on...
Trent finishes the last cross and spins around. There are
crosses all over him as well, head to 0a.

TRENT
(happily) _
What's up?

Trent hops up onto his cot.
WRENN |

My name is Dr. Wrenn, :
John...I'm here to try and get
you out.

TRENT
{gestures towards
the crosses)
After all my redecorating? I
think I'll stay.

. WRENN
I have a guard with a pair of
swollen testicles who swears
you wanted out of here last
night.

TRENT
That was last night. Today
I'll take my chances in here.

WRENN
(looking around)
I see. The crosses are a nice
touch. They'd almost have to
keep you in here once they saw
these...wouldn't they, John?

TRENT
You have a smoke?

Wrenn slowly hands him a cigarette. Trent puts it in his
mouth. Wrenn stares at the crosses covering Trent's face.
Wrenn becomes distracted by them.

TRENT (CONT. )
Does it light itself?

WRENN
(snapping out of . ,
ity

Sorry.
He lights Trent up.

TRENT
(beat)
You're waiting to hear about
my "them," aren't you?

WRENN \
Your what? v

TRENT >
My "them." Every paranoid .
schizo has one. A "them," a
“they " an "it?" Stalking and
spying. You want to hear about
my “them?*

WRENN
I want to know why you're
here.

TRENT
(beat, stares at
Wrenn)
Things are turning to shit out
there, aren't they?

WRENN
(slightly put
off)
Let's talk about you.

TRENT
How many psychos have you seen
this week, doc? Hew many had a
clue?
(beat)
I have a clue.

WRENN
Tell me about it.

TRENT
(shrugs, leans
back)
Why not. I'll talk...because
you want to hear it.

WRENN
(satisfied)
Good...that's good. ‘

Wrenn takes out a microcassette recorder and turns. it on. -

WRENN (CONT.)
You mind?

Couldn't give less of a

FLASHBACK
INT. ATLANTIC INSURANCE OFFICE - DAY
CLOSE ON A NERVOUS, OVERWEIGHT, MIDDLE-AGED MAN

His fingers tremble as he tries to light a cigarette. We
can tell his breath stinks just by looking at him. sweat
drips down at least two chins before finally coming to rest
on his. tie, which passed loud two decades ago.

A pair of rock-steady hands REACH IN and light the
cigarette for hin.

TRENT (0.S.)
Nervous, Mr. Paul?

We REVEAL John Trent, leaning against the desk that Mr.
Paul is sitting in front of. Another man, ROBINSON, sits
behind it. Trent is clean, attractive, gonfident. Light
years away from the man we know from cell number nine. He's
doing what he likes doing best, catching people in a lie.

MR. PAUL

(heavy Queens

accent)
What the fuck I got to be
nervous about? You told me ’
“come down and sign some
Papers”, I come down to sign
the papers. I sign the papers
I get the check. o

(scared)
Right?
190

Trent just stares at Mr. Paul, who begins to grow more and
more uncomfortable. After what seems like an eternity,
Trent responds.

Mr.

TRENT .
Usually, yes, that's the way 3
it goes. It's just that I have ,
a few final questions to ask
you about the fire,

MR. PAUL
More questions!? I answered
all your goddamn questions!

TRENT

Of course you have, and you've
been damn cooperative.
Atlantic Insurance appreciates
it. My friend Robby here
appreciates it.

(to Robinson)
Den't you Robby?

ROBINSON
(sarcastic) -
Immensely.

TRENT
(back to Mr.
Paul)
All we need you to do is clear
up a little argument Robby and
I seem to be having. You see,
Robby here clains that you
burned down your warehouse on
Northern Boulevard. -
ER. PAUL
(enraged)
What!? That's horseshit! My
whole stock was in that
warehouse! My whole life!

TRENT
Calm down Mr. Paul, bacause
that's just what I told ny
friend Rebby when he made such
an outrageous accusation. ’

Paul calms down.
li

TRENT (CONT.)

Thing is though, Robby and 1
have been friends for a really
long time. So I couldn't let
something like this come
between us, Could I?

(beat) a
Could I? :

MR. PAUL
(unsure)
No...

TRENT
I'm glad you understand. I
theught you would, that's why
I knew you wouldn't mind if I
checked your story out with
your wife.

. MR. PAUL
(sees it coming)
My wife?
TRENT

Yes, you see we had these
nagging pictures of your wife
tooling around town. wearing
articles which you claimed
perished in the fire.

Trent throws a package of photos into Mr. Paul's lap.

TRENT (CONT.)
And you know what else? When I
went to speak with her, she
was more than eager to tell us
what really went down.

after I showed her
the pictures of Miss Rosa. Who
seems to be wearing even pore
of the articles which you
claimed perished in the fira.

MR. PAUL
(dazed)
Miss Rosa?

Trent throws another pile of photos into Mr. Paul's lap,
then leans in quite close.
12

TRENT
Two words of advice my friend.
If you're going to pull a
scan, don't make your wife
your partner. And if you do,
don't fuck around behind her
back.

Trent smiles.

INT. MIDTOWN CUFFEE SHOP - pay
CLOSE ON A PLATE GLASS WINDOW

overlooking the busy street outside. Inside, we HEAR the
BU2Z of the heavy lunch crowd.

ROBINSON (0.S.)
That was, beautiful Johnny-boy,
you have the best nose for
shit in the business.

Out on the street, we see a city bus HISS to a stop in
front of the coffee shop window. We can see its side
advertisement, a "COMING SOON" ad for "IN THE MOUTH OF
MADNESS", bearing both Sutter Cane's nane. and the name of
his publisher, “ARCANE PUBLISHING". After a beat or two,
the bus PULLS OUT. .
TRENT (0.S.)

You were lucky this time, the

guy's wife liked my eyes.

We PULL BACK to REVEAL Trent and Robinson sharing a booth
and some coffee. :

TRENT (CCNT.)
You should train your agents
not to sell policies to
kindergarten con-men.

ROBINSON
Agents? You mean .
These greedy pricks would sell
auto insurance to blind
drivers if they thought it
could get them a commission. 1
ACROSS THE STREET, through the window, we can glimpse a
frantic MAN emerge from the office builaing facing the
coffee shop. Pudgy, balding and short, the man is
disturbing primarily due to the large fire-axe he's
gripping in both hands. Trent and Robinson haven't noticed.
13

TRENT
Relax Robby, that's why you’/
pay me. The human race is
Always looking to play an
angle, God bless their crooked
hearts. I'll always be here to
clean up the mess.

While they talk, the axe maniac is making progress. He is
cutting a reckless path across the street, swinging |
blindly. He's heading straight for the shop. Trent and
Robinson remain oblivious. After all, this is New York..

ROBINSON
That's good to hear, because I
have a serious mess with

Arcane.
TRENT
Who?
ROBINSON
(troubled)

Arcane. They're a publishing
house, and they're our biggest
account. They just’ filed a
claim. Could mean millions. I
need you on is as scon as

coee nos > = pegsible. = ----

TRENT
(brings his cup
to his lips)
What's the clain?

ROBINSON
(as if telling a
secret)
Sutter Cane is missing.

Trent has about half a second to react before the axe
maniac comes CRASHING through the plate glass window. He
lands squarely on top of Trent's table. Trent splashes
coffee all over himself as he and Robinson barely have to
time to cringe in their seats.

For an insane instant, all is QUIET, save for a few People
scrambling for the exit. We HEAR an APPROACHING SIREN in
the distance. The man with the axe glares frantically
about, before locking ayes on John Trent. :

Trent makes the mistake of returning the stare. He freezes
in place.
14

ON THE MAN

It's his eyes. They're off. Too big, too oily, human, yet
inhuman. Slightly out of proportion. The man leans down
towards Trent. .
MAN

(routine,

surprisingly

calm)

Do you read Sutter Cane?

ON TRENT
snapping out of it.

TRENT
What?

The man suddenly REARS UP and SCREAMS as he raises the axe
high above his head. Just before he cuts Trent in halt,
SHOTS RING OUT and the man Srumples to the surface of the
formica table. The axe CLANGS to the floor. Trent turns,
and sees two city cops outside the shop, one still pointing
the smoking barrel of the gun he's just fired.

Trent stares back at the dead man's face. The ey
to normal. Trent glances over at Robinson, who!’
shrunk back into his seat in shock.

TRENT
(to Robinson)
Who the fuck is Sutter Cane?

   

INT. TRENT'S APARTMENT ~ NIGHT
CLOSE ON A T.V. SCREEN

broadcasting a news report on the violent pandemonium at a
city bookstore. People of all ages and races appear to be
rioting and battling police shock troops. We can glimpse a
display ad for "IN THE MOUTH OF MADNESS" in the shop's
shattered window.

REPORTER (V.0.)
This was the scene today
outside several city
Sass bookstores. Bookstores. . . -
wl unfortunate enough to sell out
of advance orders for Sutter
Cane's "IN THE MOUTH OF t
MADNESS". What is surely the
most eagerly awaited event in
publishing history.

ON TRENT
Watching. Pouring a tequila shot with shaking hands.

ON THE T.V.

as the news report gives way to the live image of the
REPORTER himself. He's sitting opposite a more conservative
female colleague, "Crossfire" style..

REPORTER

Today's topic on "Hotseat".

«+ Harmless pop
phenomenon? or
prophet of the printed page?
When dees fiction become
religion, and are his fans
dangerous?

TRENT
Only if you count axes.

He downs the shot.

INT. ARCANE PUBLISHING - DAY
CLOSE ON AN ILLUSTRATION

Hyper-real. A circle of children in a cemetery, at night.
All caught in the midst of transforming into something not
human. Something wet, something weird, something with
tentacles. A huge shape rises out of the circle, huge
beyond belief, suggesting something too terrible to be
rendered in more detail. The illustration is all the nore
disturbing because it looks like a photograph,
16

Underneath we see its title, "'THE LESSON' by Sutter Cane."

RECEPTIONIST (0.S.)
Mr. Trent?

PULL BACK

to REVEAL Trent staring at the illustration. He turns
towards the RECEPTIONIST, an icy beauty, and we see there
are several illustraiioius aounted along the wall. All are
from the works of Sutter Cane. A "HOBB‘S END HORROR"
standee faces the reception desk.

RECEPTIONIST
Mr. Harglow will see you now.

TRENT
Thanks.

Trent heads for the inner office door. He pauses and turns
back towards the receptionist. :

TRENT
(nods towards
standee)
Doesn't that give you the
willies?

As the receptionist looks up, Trent sees that she was
reading a copy of "THE HOBB'S END HORROR" at her desk. She
looks at Trent like he's a retarded child. Trent looks at
the beok in her hands.

TRENT
Guess not.

She turns away from him as he enters. He just misses the
small trickle of blood which suddenly rolls out one of the
receptionist‘s nostrils. She self-consciously dabs at it
with a bloody tissue and buries herself back in the book.

CUT TO:
INT. HARGLOW'S OFFICE - DAY

A serious, stately man in his late sixties, HARGLOW notions
for Trent to be seated. . ‘

HARGLOW
Are you familiar with Arcane,
Mr. Trent?
17

TRENT
You're insured by the company
I work for. Beyond that,
sorry. .

STYLES (0.S.)
(playfully
sarcastic)
Read much? ee eobien :
Trent turns ‘and sees LINDA STYLES énter the room. In her
late twenties, she projects a consicerabie combination of
beauty, brains, and impatience. She's wearing the latest
designer glasses, which sit on a face topped off by a head
of flaming red hair. Trent's immediately attracted to her.

TRENT
(shooting back)
I read a book. Once.

Styles smiles. Trent's eyes follow her as she takes a seat.

HARGLOW
Allow me to introduce Linda
Styles, one of our best
editors. Linda's been handling
one author of ours
for the past two years.
Perhaps you've heard of
hin... Sutter. cane?. .

TRENT
(playing it dumb)
That horror crap right?

STYLES
(a bit offended) .
Sutter Cane happens to be this
century's most widely read
author. You can forget Stephen
King, Cane outsells them all.

HARGLOW
With Sutter Cane we've found
that humanity seems to be
consistently drawn to the
twisted, and freakish.

TRENT :
I xnow, I live in New York.
13

HARGLOW
(smiles)
Well, I've asked Linda here
because she has particular
relevance to this situation.

TRENT
Which is what, exactly?

HARGLOW
It is exactly that Sutter cane
vanished without a trace
approximately two months ago.
The police have turned up
nothing.

TRENT
Who was the last person to
hear from him?

. STYLES
His agent. Cane supposedly
sent him a portion of the new
book not more than two weeks
ago. Plain brown wrapper, no
return address.

TRENT
What'd the agent have to say?
Harglow and Styles exchange looks. Trent gets impatient.

TRENT (CONT.)
What?

HARGLOW
You heard what he had to say.”
Apparently you were there when
the poor fellow went a
bit...daft in midtown. 2
believe you saw him shot.

TRENT
(lets the
coincidence sink
in)
You mean that lunatic with
axe...that was Cane's agent?

STYLES
Hard to believe, isn't it?
wee ane

19

TRENT
Yeah, you'd think a guy who
outsells Stephen King coula “/
find better representation.

Trent waits for them to laugh. Nobody does. =.

STYLES
This is no joke Mr. Trent.
Cane's books have been rumored
to drive less stable readers
off the deep end, agents
included. - .

TRENT
How're you holding up?

STYLES
(slight grin)
Just fine.

HARGLOW
Linda's one of the few editors
brave enough to take.on Cane's
work. :

TRENT
What's happened to some of the
others?

STYLES
(matter of fact)
Severe nausea, migraines,
nosebleeds...

TRENT

(not buying it)
Nice, and you think Cane's
agent took one look at Cane's
datest masterpiece and went
axe-happy in broad daylight.

(suspicious)
It'd be a helluva promotion
for the new book...great
publicity.
HARGLOW
This isn't a hoax Mr. Trent.
Surely you believe your own
eyes, you were there. Besides,
we have no desire to publicize
Cane's connection to
this...incident. we simply
want the man, and the book
back. Sutter cane's franchise

represents eighty-percent of

our income.

STYLES
We've already delayed the new
book by one month. Cane's fans
are getting a bit... restless,

HARGLOW
We need to know if sutter Cane
is alive, or dead. Obviously,
there's a great deal of money
at stake. We're already in the
middle of a multi-million:
dollar campaign.

TRENT
T'll need to see his papers,
contracts...

a. HARGLOW
Impossible. Cane's agent
handled all the legal affairs,
a total buffer. We don't even
know where Cane lived.

STYLES
All we do know is that for a
period before the
disappearance, Cane's work
became erratic, bent. More
bizarre than usual. He becane
convinced his stories were
real, not fiction. Then the
work stopped coming.

HARGLOW
Read his work Mr. Trent. It
will help you get to know
him...

STYLES
(sniles)
It might do more than that.

Trent smirks.

Trent browses through the paperback horror section, feeling
like the idiot he thinks he looks like. He's surrounded by
Sutter Cane merchandise, some of it heralding the
forthcoming arrival of "IN THE MOUTH OF MADNESS®. Trent
scoops an armful of Cane paperbacks off the shelf. Titles
like "THE THING IN THE BASEMENT* and "THE HOBB'S END

soooR".

LITTLE BOY (0.S.)_
I can see.

Trent turns and notices a LITTLE BOY staring up at hin. The
boy is holding on to a copy of "THE HOBB'S END HORROR". The
kid appears feverish, sweaty. He's wearing a pair of
oversized glasses held together by scotch tape. His nose is
running, and he's got a scab on his chin. He picks at it as
he speaks.

TRENT
Excuse me?

LITTLE BOY

Trent flashes an uneasy smile.

INT. SUBWAY STATION = NIGHT

Trent waits for his train to arrive. He paces along the
Platform. He's carrying a shopping bag full of Cane
paperbacks. He stops when he notices that he's standing in
front of a subway advertisement for "THE HOBB'S END
HORROR". Part of it is peeling away from its frame. The
upper right corner is folding over. Just a tiny bit.

Trent steps closer to it. His fingers zeach up and grab the
corner. He pulls, gently, Peels back a little More. He can
glimpse something underneath the ad. A different ad. He
can't make out what it's for, but glimpses something shiny,
and black. Before he has time to investigate any further,
his train PULLS IN. :

nightmare. Trent's on his way home, bent around other
sweaty, disgusting commuters. Trent is wedged between a

a VERY LOUD walknan. Trent opts for staring into space.
He's carrying a shopping bag filled with Sutter cane
paperbacks. He notices an oozing wino slouched into a
corner seat, staring at him. Trent turns away.

The train comes to a sudden halt as the wheels SCREECH and
WHINE to a stop. Everyone, including Trent, is THROWN
TOGETHER, SLAMMING into the person next to them. There are
ASSORTED GROANS and CURSES.

reading lamp. Trent's face is a study in disgust, yet he's
totally involved in the book.

Ahhh!!!

Startled, Trent sends the book flying into the air. He
takes a moment to compose himself, embarrassed that he let
the book get to him. He suddenly winces and puts two

The cop from the alley is POUNDING away on the spray-

agonizingly, rises and turns to face Trent.

Of course, I edited more than

same thing.

TRENT
That our world used to be
inhabited by another race of
beings?

Beings who eventually lost
their foothold here and were
expelled. Cane's books
chronicle these creatures’
efforts to get back in.

much else to lock for. °

You and I both know what a

BEARDED MAN -

A sudden SOUND from the church commands everyone's
attention. It's a HORRIBLE GRINDING NOISE, as if the gears
of a great and terrible machine were BUCKLING into :
themselves. The mob takes « stsp back. A frightened WEASEL
cowers behind the bearded man.

WEASEL
See what ya did!

The bearded man stares at the church. The door OPENS.
Everyone FREEZES as a WIND STARTS TO WHIP UP. Trent and
Styles arrive but stay a few feet behind the mob.

again they STOP DEAD in front of an eerie little GIRL.
She's suddenly appeared right in front of them and has a
small trickle of blood coming out of one eye. Her teeth

Styles is a study in dread, as if she knew who and what
this girl represents.

INT. PICKMAN HOTEL - DUSK ==> ~"

Trent comes down into the lobby. No sign of Mrs. Pickman.
Trent pulls cut a cigarette and starts approaching the
three paintings. He lights up as he stares at thez.

ON THE PAINTINGS

They're different,- in a subtle, disturbing way. The cows
grazing in the first painting now appear sickly, with
runny, infected eyes. The grass seens more brown than |
green. One cow seems to have spronted larger teeth.

The boy playing with his dog in the second Painting appears
less joyful, more frightened of his pet. The dog itsel? is
larger.

The two lovers strolling by the creek appear unchanged,
until you notice that their eyes seem a bit nore recessed
into their faces. There also seems to be sonething rising
out of the water behind them. All the paintings seen to be
acquiring that hyper-real quality of Cane’s book covers.

ON TRENT

Staring at them. He moves forward and pulls one slightly
off the wall, checking behind it. He steps back and takes a

few drags off the cigarette as he continues to regard the
paintings.

TRENT
(to himself)
Nice try.

MRS. PICKMAN (0.S.) '
No smoking please...

Trent turns and sees the old lady. She smiles. She's
changed a little bit as well. Her eyes are red and putty
and she doesn't seem to blink. He can only see her from the
waist up, everything else is hidden behind the front desk.

‘Trent HEARS a FAINT SCRATCHING NOISE coming from behind the

counter.

MRS. PICKMAN (CONT.)

No problem, I was just
leaving. Just stopped to
admire the art.

TRENT
Sure are. Ms. Styles told me
you did them yourself. Have
you known each other long?

MRS. PICKMAN

Ms. Styles? Oh! The pretty
young thing you came in here

Trent tries to peer over the Counter, to see what's making
the faint SCRATCHING NOISE. Mrs. Picknan politely steps
forward, blocking his view. trent amiles uncomfortably,
nods goodnight, and exits. As soon as he's out the door, we
SWING AROUND and REVEAL the rest of Mrs.- Pickman behind the
front desk.

We see Mr. Pickman lying on the floor, handcuffed to his
wife's ankle. He's nude, and totally emaciated. He also
looks to be about a hundred years old. His leathery skin
stretches over brittle bones. He's covered in black and
blue marks.

The scratching is coming from his long fingernails SCRAPING
his wife's neaty calf in a vain effort to put up some
resistance. We only see this for a few brief monents.

MRS. PICKMAN
Hush.

INT. TRENT AND STYLES' ROOM - DUSK

Nothing but STATIC. She puts it down, and as she does 80,
she stares at her copy of "THE HOBB'S END HORROR. *
She picks it up. Starts flipping. through it. She stares at
the book's cover. The black church. She turns it over, and
sees the announcement on its back Cover; “COMING SOON FROM

Styles is making her way towards the black church. She
walks past shattered Store windows and abandoned cars, She
notices that the Street is somewhat littered with spent
rifle shells. a child's ball suddenly rolis up to her and
stops at her feet. She freezes.

A little Boy of about six starts to approach her. She
Squats down and picks Up the ball. He's wearing shorts and
a teshirt. As he comes closer, he appears to suffer trom
the same disease as the previous little girl ("The end").

He's all out of Proportion. Eyes, teeth, limbs, Nothing
fits. His eyes are 80 big that we can make out
crisscrossing red veins in the whites,

Styles hands hin the ball.

He suddenly runs off. Styles rises, HEARS the WHIMPER of a
dog behind her and spins around. She comes face to face
with the little girl ("The end") and her friends. They ‘ve

apparently caught the dog, because it atands to one side,
and it's missing a leg. .

The little girl ana several of the other Children have
small spots of blood on their faces ana Clothes. The little
girl has bits of dog hair stuck around her nouth and when
she smiles, she reveals teeth that are now pointed.

trapdoor leading upward into the steeple attic. She pushes

axe. We glimpse another, frail silhouette waving about
madly. The unfortunate Mr. Pickman.
