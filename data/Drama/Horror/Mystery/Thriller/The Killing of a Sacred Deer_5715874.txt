THE KILLING OF A SACRED DEER

Inspired by a Euripides tragedy, THE KILLING OF A SACRED
DEER centres on Steven, a charismatic surgeon, and a teenage
boy who seeks to integrate him into his broken family. When the
boy’s actions become increasingly sinister, Steven’s ideal life starts
to fall apart and he is forced to make an unthinkable sacrifice.
INT. HOSPITAL - OPERATING THEATRE - MORNING

STEVEN, a cardiothoracic surgeon, around 45 years old,
MATTHEW, an anaesthetist of around 55, and three SURGICAL
NURSES are leaning over the chest of a patient. They are
performing open heart surgery. We follow the surgical
instruments as they explore the patient’s internal organs.
The surgeon’s movements are precise, considered. The
procedure unfolds in perfect synchronicity. No one misses a
beat. The only sounds are the clink of metal instruments, the
doctors’ breathing, and the electronic beep of the heart
monitor.

BLACK SCREEN - OPENING CREDITS

INT. HOSPITAL - SURGERY PREPARATION ROOM - MORNING

Steven and Matthew stand at a sink, washing their hands.
Their scrubs are splattered with blood. The overhead lighting
is harsh. The anaesthetist takes his watch out of his pocket
and puts it on. The surgeon takes the anaesthetist’s hand and
studies his watch.

Steven
Nice watch.

Matthew
Thanks.

STEVEN
What’s the water resistance?

MATTHEW
200 metres.

Steven
It also has a date display.

MATTHEW
Yes, it does.

STEVEN
I might have gone for a metal strap
instead of a leather strap.

MATTHEW
Oh, really?

STEVEN
Yes. I think I’d prefer a metal
strap. I’ve had this one for years
and it’s as good as new.

He shows Matthew the watch he’s wearing, which has a metal
strap. Matthew studies it carefully.
MATTHEW
What’s the water resistance?

STEVEN
100 metres.

MATTHEW
How long have you had it?

STEVEN
Nine years. I’m a bit bored of it,
actually. I’ve been thinking about
getting a new one for a while now.

MATTHEW
Think about it. We can go together
to the place where I bought it. If
I tell them you’re a colleague of
mine, a friend, they'll definitely
give you a better price. Both the
owner and his father have been
patients of mine, so I know them
quite well. Think about it.

Steven looks at Matthew’s watch again. He smiles almost
imperceptibly and with a nod assures Matthew that he will
think about it. The anaesthetist leaves the room.

INT. HOSPITAL - STEVEN'S OFFICE - AFTERNOON

Steven unlocks the door to his office. A small room with two
chairs, a two-seater sofa, and a metal locker. He opens the
locker, takes off his white coat and hangs it up. He puts on
a blazer and picks up his leather briefcase.

INT. BURGER KING - AFTERNOON

Steven sits in a Burger King, waiting for someone. He sips a
soft drink. There are barely any customers, it’s a slow time
of day. On the table in front of him is a small piece of
apple pie. MARTIN, a teenage boy, rushes over to Steven's
table. His face is flushed and his T-shirt is patchy with
sweat. Martin, around 15, is dressed like a typical teenager.
He has a nondescript face, not particularly likeable but not
unlikeable either.

MARTIN
Hi.

STEVEN
Hi.

MARTIN

Sorry to keep you waiting. Did you
eat?
STEVEN
I’ve just had some apple pie.

MARTIN
Do you mind if I grab something to
eat before we go? I’m starving.

STEVEN
Sure. No problem.

MARTIN
Are you sure you don’t want
anything? Chicken wings?

STEVEN
No, thank you. I’m fine. Do you
have money? I can give you some.

MARTIN
No, I’ve got money, thanks. I’1l be
right back.

The boy leaves. Steven’s mobile phone rings. He switches the
ringer to silent and ignores the call. He watches the boy as
he waits for his order. Martin comes back. Steven watches
Martin while he eats. The boy eats very methodically. He
folds his napkin neatly and puts it to one side.

STEVEN
Did you get a haircut?

MARTIN
Yes. Do you like it?

STEVEN
It looks great.

A beat of silence.

STEVEN (CONT'D)
Aren’t you going to eat your chips?

MARTIN

I’m saving them ‘til last.
STEVEN

Why?
MARTIN

I really like chips. I always save
them for last.

STEVEN
I do that too.

Martin finishes his burger then starts eating his chips. He
leaves half of them untouched and pushes his plate away.
STEVEN (CONT'D)
Shall we go?

MARTIN
I’ve got French class in an hour.
Will I be back in time?

STEVEN
Yes, definitely. Don’t worry.

EXT. SEASIDE ROAD - AFTERNOON

Steven and Martin are standing beside the car. It is parked
near the sea. The weather is fine, the sea calm. A few people
are swimming. The boy takes off his jacket.

MARTIN
Sorry I was late today, Steven.

STEVEN
It doesn’t matter.

MARTIN
I was at a friend’s house. He got a
new motorbike and I wanted to check
it out. He took me for a ride,
that’s why I was late.

STEVEN
It’s fine.

MARTIN
He even let me ride it for a bit.

STEVEN
I hope you were wearing helmets.

MARTIN
Yes, of course we were. We weren’t
going very fast anyway.

A beat of silence.

STEVEN
I got you a present.

Steven hands Martin a small box. The boy opens the box.
Inside is a new watch. It’s the same one the anaesthetist was

wearing.

MARTIN
I don’t know how to thank you. It’s
really nice. Thank you so much. Can
I give you a kiss?

The doctor nods. The boy kisses him and strokes his cheek. He
slips the watch onto his right wrist.
MARTIN (CONT'D)
Thank you so much.

STEVEN
It’s water resistant up to 200
metres.

MARTIN

Fantastic. Does this come off? I'd
prefer a leather strap.

STEVEN
It comes off, yes. You can put on
any strap you like. But metal ones
are more hard-wearing, that’s why I
got you the metal strap. It’s more
expensive too.

MARTIN
Yes. Thank you so much.

EXT. STEVEN’S HOUSE - GARDEN - NIGHT

A detached suburban house. Steven is sitting at the garden
table with his two children: KIM, a girl of 14, and BOB, a 12
year old boy. A hush hangs in the air. The garden is
perfectly manicured and the flowers are well tended. The
doctor's wife brings out a dish with meat and starts to serve
everyone. She is around 40, rather beautiful. Her name is
ANNA.

KIM
Dad, do you remember Claire, my
friend from school?

STEVEN
Yes.

KIM
It’s her birthday and she’s having
a party in two weeks. At her place.
She’s invited most of the class.
Can I go?

STEVEN
We'll see.

BOB
Dad, if Kim goes can I go with her?

STEVEN
I don’t know, darling. Your mother
and I will discuss it and we’ll
see.
ANNA
I say they can go. Claire is a very
nice girl. She’s the girl we met at
the mall with her parents who asked
you about becoming a doctor. The
one who wants to be a cardiologist.

STEVEN
Yes, I remember.

ANNA
How was work today?

STEVEN
Fine. How about you?

ANNA
I've decided to make a few changes
at the clinic. I’m going to get it
painted, buy a new sofa. I’m
thinking of doing it now before my
receptionist goes on leave. Did I
tell you she’s pregnant?

STEVEN
Yes. Good for her.
ANNA
Yes. She finally succeeded. She’s

thrilled.

(Looking at her son.)
Look at you, all hunched over.
You'll strain your back like that,
how many times do I have to tell
you? And your hair is practically
trailing in your food.

STEVEN
Bob, you promised me you'd get a
haircut and you still haven’t done

it.
BOB
I'll get a haircut.
STEVEN
Tomorrow.
BOB
Not tomorrow, Dad. After the party.
ANNA
I like his hair long. He has lovely
hair.
KIM

What about mine?
ANNA
You have lovely hair too. We all
have lovely hair. And darling, you
have to go to the dentist. It’s
been over six months, it’s time to
get your teeth cleaned again. I’1l
book an appointment for Friday
afternoon. Is Friday afternoon all
right? Do you have any appointments
at the hospital?

STEVEN
No. Friday after five is fine.
Thank you.

INT. STEVEN'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Anna is sitting in front of the mirror, removing her make-up.
Steven is lying in bed in his pyjamas, looking at something
on his phone. The room is dimly lit.

ANNA
I bought that dress you liked. I
can wear it tomorrow. I can’t show
it to you now, it needed some
alterations. I’m picking it up
tomorrow.

STEVEN
The black one?

ANNA
It was the black one you liked,
wasn’t it?

STEVEN
Yes. The other one looked great on
you too, but I think the black one
was perfect.

ANNA
I’m worried it’s a bit too short.
I'd like it better if it was below
the knee.

STEVEN
You’ve got great legs. You’ve got
the most beautiful legs of any
ophthalmologist anywhere in the
world.

ANNA
Let me think, yes, of all the
cardiologists in the world, there's
no doubt at all, you are most
definitely the biggest flatterer of
them all.
STEVEN
Is that a problem?

ANNA
No, that’s not a problem. And
that’s why tomorrow I’m going to
bake a lemon cake and nobody’s
going to eat any of it, but you.

STEVEN
Not even the kids?

ANNA
Not even the kids. Did I tell you
about my receptionist?

STEVEN
Yes.

ANNA
If Kim was a bit more dependable,
she could help arrange the
appointments at the clinic until
Christina gets back.

STEVEN
Kim could handle that just fine.

ANNA
I don’t know. I hope so. Did I tell
you, Bob announced me the other day
he wants to be an ophthalmologist.

STEVEN
Yes, you did. Bob would be a coal
miner if you were one too. Do you
mind if I turn the light off?

Anna gets up and kisses him on the mouth for a long time.

ANNA
No.

They carry on kissing with the lights on. Anna pulls Steven’s
pyjama bottoms off.

INT. HOSPITAL - STEVEN'S OFFICE - MORNING

Steven is examining a PATIENT. There is a knock at the door.
Steven’s SECRETARY enters.

SECRETARY
Excuse me, Doctor. There’s a boy
for you outside. He says it’s
urgent.
STEVEN
I’ll be out in five minutes. Tell
him to wait.

10 INT. HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR —- MORNING

Steven sees Martin waiting for him in the corridor. He takes
him to one side.

STEVEN
Look I’ve told you, it’s best not
to come to the hospital without
calling me first.

MARTIN
You're right. I’m sorry. I just
wanted to thank you again and show
you the new strap I got for my
watch. I swapped the metal strap
for a leather one. I’m sorry, I
didn’t mean to put you in an
awkward position. Bye.

The boy walks away.

STEVEN
Martin. Come here. What kind of
strap did you get?

MARTIN
(Without turning his head)
Brown leather.

The doctor hurries after the boy and catches up with him.

STEVEN
Show me.

Martin hesitates at first, then shows him the watch.

STEVEN (CONT'D)
It’s very nice.

MARTIN
Do you really think so? Or are you
just being polite?

STEVEN
I really like it. Next time you
want to come here, please call me
first. You have my number. It’s for
your own good. I might be with a
patient or in surgery or ina
meeting. There’s no point you
waiting around if I can’t see you.
I’m telling you for your own good.
MARTIN
Okay.

Matthew walks past, holding a patient’s file.
to Steven and puts on his reading glasses.

MATTHEW
Good morning.
STEVEN
Good morning, Matthew.
MATTHEW
Could you please take a quick look

at this.
He shows Steven the file.

STEVEN
Of course, Matthew. Please leave it
on my desk. I’1l have a look ina
minute.

Martin looks at the anaesthetist.

MARTIN
We've got the same watch.

The anaesthetist turns to look at Martin, who
watch.

STEVEN
Let me introduce you. This young
man is one of my son’s classmates.
I ran into Martin and his parents
at the mall last week. He told me
he’s very interested in medicine.
He wants to be a cardiologist. I
suggested he drop by some time, so
he can see what being a doctor is
really about. Martin, this is
Matthew, a great friend of mine and
an excellent anaesthetist.

MATTHEW
That's great. Nice to meet you.

MARTIN
Nice to meet you too. Steven, I’m
going to leave it on your desk. Let
me know when you’re ready.

The anaesthetist walks off.

STEVEN
I’ve got to go back in now. We'll
talk on the phone to arrange our
next meeting. All right?

10.

He comes over

shows him his

MARTIN
Okay.

INT. STEVEN'S HOUSE - KIM’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Steven, dressed in a suit and bow tie, sits opposite Kim. She
is doing voice exercises. She exhales slowly, controlling her
diaphragm, then takes a deep breath and runs through a series
of vocal scales. Bob has just had a shower and is combing his
hair very thoroughly and very slowly.

Steven watches his daughter with pride, holding her gaze as
she performs her vocal drills. When she finishes, Steven
claps, stands up, and kisses her on the cheek.

STEVEN
I think your breathing has really
improved over the last few months.

KIM
That’s what the choirmaster said
too.

STEVEN

Did you tell him to move you closer
to the front?

KIM
Yes, I did. He said he’1ll see what
he can do.
Steven turns to Bob.
STEVEN
Did you water the plants, Bob?
BOB
Mum said she was going to water
them.
STEVEN

Your mother works very hard. That’s
why we said it would be nice to
help her as much as we can, and we
agreed that Kim would take care of
walking the dog and you would take
care of the plants.

BOB
I'll do the dog and Kim can do the
plants.

STEVEN

You're too young to be wandering
around at night by yourself.
12.

Bob gives the comb to Kim.

BOB
Thanks for the comb.

KIM
You’re welcome.

Bob leaves the room. The door opens and Anna walks in.

ANNA
We've got to go.

STEVEN
Tell Bob to water the plants now
that the sun has gone down.

ANNA
I’ve watered them already. Come on,
we're going to be late.

12 INT. CARDIOLOGY CONFERENCE - HALL - NIGHT

Steven is at the podium giving a speech. The conference hall
is quite evidently full of doctors.

STEVEN
A full 22 years have passed since
the German cardiologist Andreas
Gruentzig performed the first
coronary angioplasty, on 16
September 1977. Today, that first
patient is still alive and well.
Dr. Gruentzig, however, had an
unfortunate accident and met with
an untimely end. In short, he is
one of those rare cases where one
can say: “The operation was a
success, but unfortunately the
doctor didn’t make it.”

Scattered laughter in the audience. The doctor chuckles and
takes a sip of water before he continues.

STEVEN (CONT'D)
In the two decades that have passed
since that first coronary
angioplasty, many things have
changed. The indications for
angioplasty are more widespread,
alternatives to the classic balloon
method have been developed, and an
angioplasty during the acute phase
of a heart attack is practically a
routine operation nowadays.

(MORE )
13.

STEVEN (CONT'D)

But now let’s touch upon the
importance, both for us doctors and
for our patients, of the
development and use of the stent.

Anna watches her husband with pride. Matthew, sitting next to
her, gets up.

MATTHEW
I'm going for a cigarette. I’1l be
at the bar. Come find me when it’s

over.
ANNA
Okay.
13 INT. CARDIOLOGY CONFERENCE - PARTY - NIGHT

Steven is talking to Anna, Matthew and an ELDERLY MAN, who is
holding a flamboyant cocktail.

ELDERLY MAN
The guy who made it told me what
was in it. I can’t remember now but
it’s very refreshing. Would you
like one?

STEVEN
No, thank you.

ELDERLY MAN
Try it. It’s really delicious. Use
this straw, I haven’t touched it.

ANNA
He hasn’t had a drink in three
years. High GGT and elevated
transaminases.

ELDERLY MAN
Good on you for not drinking.

Steven smiles.

MATTHEW
Well, I wouldn’t say no toa
cocktail, if you’re still offering.

ELDERLY MAN
Of course. I’1l get you one right
away.

ANNA
I think we should go soon.

MATTHEW
It’s early.
14.

ANNA
He’s got surgery in the morning and
he needs to get some sleep.

MATTHEW
It’s still early.

STEVEN
We've got surgery in the morning.

MATTHEW
Fine, okay. How are the kids?

ANNA
They're doing very well. Bob
started piano lessons and the
teacher says he’s really talented.
Now we need to buy him one so that
he can practise at home, but I
haven’t got round to it. I’m
renovating the clinic. I’m on the
phone all day.

STEVEN
Our daughter started menstruating
last week.

MATTHEW
(awkwardly)
Great.

STEVEN
Yes. She was a little scared, but
she’s okay now. You haven’t seen
her in ages.

MATTHEW
Not since last summer. At that
school choir concert.

ANNA
You’1l have to come over for dinner
one night. You really shouldn't
stay late either. Just drink that
cocktail you ordered and get
yourself home. You have to be at
the hospital in six hours. Shall we
go, darling?

STEVEN
Yes.
14 EXT. SEASIDE ROAD - AFTERNOON

Steven is eating an ice cream with Martin. The doctor stares
at the boy’s wrist as he eats his ice cream.
15.

STEVEN
You're not wearing your watch.

MARTIN
Yes, I took it off to take a shower
and left it at home.

STEVEN
It’s water resistant up to 200
metres.

MARTIN

Oh, that’s right. I forgot.

STEVEN
If you don’t like it, we can go
back to the shop and you can choose
one that you do like.

MARTIN
No, I really like it. I just took
it off to take a shower and forgot
to put it back on, that’s all.

Martin carries on eating his ice cream. It’s quite clear that
the subject is closed.

STEVEN
Do you have many friends?

MARTIN
Not that many. I don’t think people
can have a lot of friends. I mean,
it’s difficult. The important thing
in life is to have good friends,
not lots of friends. That’s what my
dad used to tell me.

STEVEN
Your father was absolutely right.

MARTIN
Yes, I know. I have a very good
friend from school who plays
basketball. We go and play together
sometimes. And a friend who lives
in France. I don’t see him very
often. He usually comes in the
summer with his family. He’s a
great guy, very polite, lots of
hobbies. I really miss him. I also
consider my mum to be a friend. I
know it might sound strange, but
ever since my dad died we’ve become
very close, me and my mum. We talk
about things, lots of things. She
helps me as much as she can with a
lot of stuff. And I help her too.
16.

STEVEN
I'd like to ask you a favour. Only
if you want to of course, I don’t
want you to feel any pressure or
obligation. It just seemed to me
like a good idea, so I thought I'd
ask.

He hesitates for a moment.

STEVEN (CONT'D)
I'd like you to come by my house
one day. To meet my wife and
children. I think you’d all get
along really well, especially with
Bob. They’re both lovely kids, I
think you'll get along great. What
do you think? Like I said, I don’t
want to pressure you, come only if
you'd genuinely like to.

Martin looks at him for a few seconds without saying

anything.
MARTIN
Are you serious? I'd love to come
to your house.
15 EXT. STEVEN'S HOUSE - AFTERNOON

Martin enters the front garden of Steven’s house. He is
carrying a bunch of flowers and a plastic bag. He rings the
doorbell. Anna opens the front door.

ANNA
Good afternoon. You must be Martin.
MARTIN
That's right. These flowers are for
you.
ANNA
Thank you very much, Martin. Come
on in.
16 EXT. STEVEN'S HOUSE - GARDEN - AFTERNOON

Martin goes out into the back garden with Anna. Steven walks
over to greet him.

STEVEN
Hi, Martin. Did you find the house
all right?

MARTIN

Yes, it was very easy.
17

17.

STEVEN
You’ve met Anna. Now let me
introduce you to my children. This
is Bob. And this is Kim.

MARTIN
Very nice to meet you. I’ve brought
you some little gifts.

STEVEN
That’s very kind of you.

Martin takes two small boxes out of his plastic bag and gives
them to Bob and Kim. They start unwrapping the presents.

ANNA
Thank you.

MARTIN
It’s a key ring with a musical note
on it for Kim, because I know she
likes music. And one with a smiley
face for Bob.

BOB
Thanks.

ANNA
What lovely key rings. Now let’s
get a move on and eat before the
food gets cold. Are you hungry,
Martin?

MARTIN
Yes, I’m starving.

INT. STEVEN'S HOUSE - KIM’S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON

Martin is sitting on the edge of the bed. Bob is sitting next
to him. Bob is staring at Martin’s shoes, which are identical
to his own - probably another gift from Steven. Kim is
standing by the wardrobe. Martin stares at a photograph of
Kim, lying on a beach in a swimsuit. A child’s leg, probably
Bob's, is also visible beside her in the picture.

MARTIN
How long have you been in the
choir, Kim?

KIM
Two years. Since I was 12. Do you
like singing?

MARTIN
I love it. But I haven’t got a very
good voice.
18.

BOB
How old are you?
MARTIN
15.
BOB
Have you got hair under your arms
yet?
MARTIN
Yes.
KIM
I just got my first period.
MARTIN
Do you mind if I light a cigarette?
BOB
You'd better not.
KIM
It’s all right. Just go over by the

window.
Martin goes over to the window and smokes a cigarette.

MARTIN
Can you sing us something?

KIM
What, now?

MARTIN
Yes. Anything you like.

KIM
Not right now.

BOB
She's embarrassed.

KIM
No I’m not. I just don’t feel like
it. When did you start smoking?

MARTIN
Eight months ago. I was over at a
friend’s place, it was a party
actually, and we’d had way too much
to drink and a girl offered me a
cigarette and I said “why not” and
lit up. That was a mistake. I
regret it, but it’s too late now.
I’m addicted.
19.

BOB
Can you show me the hair under your
arms?

MARTIN
Sure.

Martin shows Bob his underarm hair.

BOB
You haven’t got that much. Have you
seen how hairy my dad is?

MARTIN
No.

BOB
He’s got three times more hair than
you do.

KIM

You've got a great body.

MARTIN
Thanks.

An awkward pause.

MARTIN (CONT'D)
Do you want to go out for a walk?
It’s a really nice day.

BOB
I'd rather stay here and listen to
music.

Bob picks up his headphones and an MP3 player.

KIM
Is that my MP3 player or yours?

BOB
Mine. You've asked me a million
times. And don’t you dare take this
one and lose it as well, because
Dad said he’s not going to buy us
new ones.

BOB (CONT'D)
What kind of music do you listen
to?

MARTIN
All kinds.

BOB
I‘m into metal and punk. What about
you?
18

19

20

20.

MARTIN
I think all kinds of music are
worth listening to. It depends on
my mood and what I’m doing..

Bob puts his headphones on before Martin can finish his
sentence.

KIM
I'll come for a walk, if you like.
We can take the dog with us. If you
don’t mind.

MARTIN
I'd rather it was just the two of
us. I always get nervous around
dogs, in case they get into a fight
with another dog. Separating dogs
that are fighting scares me.

EXT. ROAD - AFTERNOON

Martin and Kim are walking along the road. There is an
awkward distance between them and they both stare straight
ahead. Martin has one hand in his jacket pocket and a
cigarette in the other. Kim walks a few steps behind him,
watching him. She picks up her pace and catches up with
Martin. She undoes her ponytail and shakes out her hair.

EXT. PARK —- AFTERNOON

Martin is sitting on a bench watching Kim. She stands facing
him, singing a song. Martin nods his head in time with the
music. Kim sways as she sings, not quite dancing. She holds a
lit cigarette in one hand.

INT. STEVEN'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON

Martin is sitting on the sofa. Kim sits next to him. Anna,

opposite them, is serving lemonade. On the table is a plate
with some carrot cake. The dog is staring at the cake. Bob

still has his headphones on.

MARTIN

Is this homemade lemonade?
ANNA

Yes.
MARTIN

It’s amazing. My mother makes
lemonade too. But she hasn’t made
it in a while. I’1l ask her to make
some. I love lemonade.
21.

He drains his glass of lemonade and refills it.

MARTIN (CONT'D)
The kids’ rooms are amazing. So big
and bright. I told Bob to put a
pull-up bar in his bedroom doorway.
I’ve got one and I do a few pull-
ups every time I walk past.

STEVEN
That’s a great idea.

BOB
I don’t think so. Pull-up bars in
doorways are dangerous. You might
fall.

MARTIN
If you attach it to the door frame
properly, you won’t fall.

BOB
Okay. If we get one, we’ll ask you
to come help us put it up.

MARTIN
With pleasure. You know this whole
house is really amazing.

STEVEN
You're welcome to spend the night,
if you like. We can easily fit a
mattress on the floor next to Bob’s
bed. You can play together in the
morning and I'll drop you back home
tomorrow afternoon.

MARTIN
Thank you very much, but I’d rather
go home tonight. I don’t like
leaving my mother by herself. She
wouldn’t mind if I told her I was
spending the night here, but I'd

better not.
STEVEN
Whatever you like.
MARTIN
Can I have a piece of cake please?
ANNA
Of course you can. What about you
guys?
KIM

No.
21

22

Bob doesn’t respond.

INT. STEVEN'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT.

22.

Anna is in the en-suite bathroom, flossing her teeth. Steven

is already in bed.

ANNA
What a charming boy.
STEVEN
Isn't he?
ANNA
Yes, very. How did his father die?
STEVEN
Car crash.
ANNA
You should tell him to come round

again.
The doctor’s mobile phone rings. He ignores it.

STEVEN
I will. He'll be great company for
Bob. I thought next time I could
take them both out somewhere, for a
bike ride.

ANNA
Darling, you should get that. It
might be the hospital.

Steven answers his phone. It’s Martin. Steven gets up and

leaves the room.

INT. STEVEN'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT

Steven goes out into the corridor. He tries to speak quietly.

STEVEN
Hello?
MARTIN
Hello. How are you?
STEVEN
I'm fine, Martin. Has something
happened?
MARTIN

No. I just called to tell you I had
a wonderful time today.
23.

STEVEN
I’m very pleased to hear that.

MARTIN
Yes. I thought I should return the
favour, so I'd like to invite you
to dinner. At my house. My mother
will be delighted to see you. She
hasn’t seen you in two years, not
since the hospital. I asked her if
she'd like you to come for dinner
one day and she said she'd like
that very much. She’ll bake a meat
pie.

STEVEN
That's very kind of you. We’1ll do
that someday.

MARTIN
Tomorrow night. I told her already.
I've asked her to make meat pie and
lemonade. I’1l be home by eight-
thirty. Around nine?

STEVEN
All right. Around nine.

MARTIN
I can buy some non-alcoholic beers,
if you like.

STEVEN

No, there’s no need.

MARTIN
I‘1l buy four and if you don’t
drink them it doesn’t matter. My
mother will drink them, or some
other guest another day. So I’1ll
see you tomorrow at nine. Good
night and sorry to disturb you. Are
Kim and Bob asleep?

STEVEN
Yes.

MARTIN
I’m going to sleep now, too. Good
night.

STEVEN

Good night.

INT. HOSPITAL - SURGERY PREP ROOM - MORNING

Steven pulls off his bloodied surgical gloves. He washes his
hands and then applies steriliser. Matthew, standing beside

him, takes off his disposable hat, gloves, and surgical mask
and throws them in the bin.

MATTHEW
A friend of mine brought me a huge
steelhead the other day. I thought
I'd barbecue it. Do you and Anna
want to come over for lunch on
Saturday?

STEVEN
I’d love to. I’1l talk to Anna
tonight to check we can make it and
let you know.

MATTHEW
Does Anna eat fish?

STEVEN
Yes, she does.

MATTHEW
I’m only asking because she seems
like quite a picky eater.

STEVEN
No, she isn’t. She loves fish.

MATTHEW
Perfect. Then you must come. Tell
her I'll be offended if you don’t.

INT. HOSPITAL CAR PARK - EVENING

Steven approaches his car. The car park is fairly dark.
Steven gets into his car and switches on the engine. As he
pulls away, he sees a figure moving behind some parked cars.
It looks like Martin. He’s wearing the same jacket as Martin,
but we can’t see his face. As Steven drives towards him, the
figure runs towards the fire escape, opens the door, and
disappears.

INT. MARTIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Steven, Martin and MARTIN’S MOTHER have just finished dinner.
Martin’s mother is around 45 years old, a little plump, and
has a beautiful face. She is dressed rather formally and is
heavily made up. The living room is spacious and decorated in
a conventional style. Everything is just so. Martin drains a
glass of lemonade. His mother clears away the dishes and
takes them into the kitchen.
25.

STEVEN
Did you come to the hospital today?

MARTIN
No. I was at school, then I went to
the gym and my French class.
Weren’t you at the hospital today?

STEVEN
I was, but I was really busy. I
just wondered whether you came by
and couldn’t find me.

Martin’s mother returns.

MARTIN
I'd like us to watch a film
together, if you don’t mind.

MARTIN'S MOTHER
I'd gladly watch a film.

STEVEN
I'm afraid I have to be getting
home soon. I can’t be out too late.
I didn’t tell my wife I’d be late
tonight and she might get worried.

MARTIN'S MOTHER
You could call her. In any case, if
you feel tired we can stop the
film, you can go home and we can
watch the rest next time you come.

MARTIN
Please. We've rented my favourite
film. It was my father’s favourite
film too.

INT. MARTIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Steven, Martin, and Martin’s mother are sitting on the sofa
watching the film. She looks rapt. Martin yawns.

MARTIN
I think I’1l go to bed. I’m tired.
Besides, I’ve got to get up early
tomorrow to finish my homework. I’m
sorry I can’t watch the end of the
film with you.

He gives them both a kiss and hug.

MARTIN (CONT'D)
Good night.
26.

MARTIN'S MOTHER
Good night.

STEVEN
Good night.

Sitting on the sofa side by side, Steven and Martin’s mother
carry on watching the film for a while.

MARTIN'S MOTHER
He really loves you, you know. He
talks about you a lot.

STEVEN
I love him too.

MARTIN'S MOTHER
Have you been married long?

STEVEN
16 years.

MARTIN'S MOTHER
You have lovely hands.

STEVEN
Thank you.

MARTIN'S MOTHER
Most doctors have beautiful hands.
So white and soft and clean.

STEVEN
Really?

MARTIN'S MOTHER
Yes. I remember your hands from
back when I used to visit my
husband at the hospital. In fact, I
even told him about your hands and
he agreed. “You're right, he has
beautiful hands,” he said.

STEVEN
Thank you very much.

MARTIN'S MOTHER
Do you remember me coming to the
hospital?

STEVEN
Of course.

MARTIN'S MOTHER
I was a bit heavier then. And my
hair was brown.
She moves

27.

STEVEN
Yes.

MARTIN'S MOTHER
I got tired of it. I dyed it about
a month ago. Did you prefer me with
brown hair? Like it was back then?

STEVEN
I think it’s nicer now.

MARTIN'S MOTHER
Yes. I agree. Do you like the film?

STEVEN
Yes, it’s good.

MARTIN'S MOTHER
It gets better. You’ll see. Would
you like some dessert?

STEVEN
No, thank you.

MARTIN'S MOTHER
Maybe later, then. You did eat a
lot.

closer to him.
MARTIN'S MOTHER (CONT’D)

Can I have a closer look at your
hands?

Steven looks embarrassed. Reluctantly, he extends a hand.

Martin’s mother looks at the doctor’s hand. She kisses it
momentarily, almost reverently. Then again and again, all

over. She

sticks his whole thumb in her mouth. He stands up.

MARTIN'S MOTHER (CONT’D)
Don't be afraid. He’s definitely
asleep. There’s nothing to be
afraid of. In any case, he wants
this as much as I do, you know.

STEVEN
I have to go. It’s late. Thank you
for dinner. I have to go. Have a
good night.

MARTIN'S MOTHER
I’m sorry if I made you feel
awkward. I didn’t mean to. But I
won’t let you leave until you've
tried my tart. I made it for you
specially.

(MORE )
27

28.

MARTIN’S MOTHER (CONT'D)
It’s a caramel tart with custard
cream. I’ll bring you some now.
Please, sit down.

STEVEN
I’m afraid I really have to go.
Good night.

The doctor gets his coat and bag and walks out.

INT. HOSPITAL - STEVEN’S OFFICE - MORNING

Steven walks into his office. Martin is there, sitting ina
chair. The doctor is startled to see him. He stands in the
doorway holding his bag. Martin smiles at him.

MARTIN
Good morning.

STEVEN
What are you doing here? Why aren’t
you in school?

MARTIN
My heart aches.

The boy takes off his T-shirt.

STEVEN
What do you mean?

MARTIN
I’m in pain. It’s my chest, my
heart. I’m worried.

STEVEN
There’s no reason for you to be
worried.

MARTIN
I’m worried because it’s
hereditary.

STEVEN

You're too young to be worried.

MARTIN
That’s what you said about my
father. And he didn’t smoke, he ate
a very healthy diet, he went
swimming almost every day. He
should have come out of that
surgery alive but he died. I also
smoke. I started smoking recently.

(Touching his chest.)

It hurts here. I hardly slept at
all last night.

(MORE )
28

29.

MARTIN (CONT'D)
My mother was terribly worried. I
slept in her bed.

Steven attaches some electrodes to the boy’s chest.

INT. HOSPITAL - STRESS TEST ROOM —- MORNING

Martin is running on a treadmill. Wires are attached to his
body. Steven measures Martin’s blood pressure while he runs.

INT. HOSPITAL - STEVEN’S OFFICE - MORNING

Martin removes the electrodes from his body and puts his T-
shirt back on.

MARTIN
If I had hair on my chest and
stomach, how would you attach
these?

STEVEN
We'd shave the hair off first.

MARTIN
How long does it take for the hair
to grow back?

STEVEN
I don’t know. About a month, I
suppose.

MARTIN

Your son told me you have loads of
hair under your arms, three times
more than I do. And that you have a
hairy belly and a hairy back.

STEVEN
I probably do have a bit more hair
than you do because I’m older than
you. But you’1l soon have more hair
too. It’s all down to hormones.

MARTIN
Can I see? Please. Take off your
shirt and show me, please.

The doctor hesitates, but eventually complies. Martin stares
at his body.

MARTIN (CONT'D)
Okay, you do have more than me. But
not three times more.

(MORE )
30.

MARTIN (CONT'D)

Mum and I thought it would be nice
if you came for dinner with us
tonight, then we can watch the rest
of the film. Is nine good for you?

STEVEN
Thank you very much, but I’m afraid
I can’t make it tonight. I need to

be home.

MARTIN
Can’t you get away for a couple of
hours?

STEVEN

I'm afraid not. Some other time.

MARTIN
My mother will be upset. I’11 tell
you a secret, but don’t tell her I
told you. I think she likes you. I
mean she’s attracted to you. She
says that’s not true, but I’m sure
of it. And to be honest, I think
you're perfect for each other.
You'd make a great couple. She’s
got a great body, you’ve seen that
for yourself. She lost weight and
now she’s has a really lovely
figure.

STEVEN

Your mother is very beautiful, but
the idea that she and I could ever
be together is ludicrous. Let me
remind you that I’m a married man
and I love my wife very much, and
my kids, and that we are very happy
together.

The boy looks at Steven, half sad and half angry. Tears well
up in his eyes.

STEVEN (CONT'D)

And for your information, you're
absolutely fine. There’s nothing
wrong with you. But you really
should stop smoking. Do you
promise?

Martin stands up.
MARTIN

So we’re okay? There’s nothing
wrong with me?
30

31

31.

STEVEN
You couldn’t be healthier. Now
you'd better go because I’m late
for my rounds. Let’s talk tomorrow
or the day after and arrange to
meet again.

Steven heads towards the door.

MARTIN
I want you to buy me a motorbike. A
white Honda CRF250. Will you?

STEVEN
We'll talk about it next time we
meet.

INT. MATTHEW'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

Steven and Matthew are standing over the steelhead trout.
Matthew is gutting the fish. Steven watches him, drinking
ginger beer from a bottle.

INT. BURGER KING - AFTERNOON

Martin is sitting by himself. He has finished his meal and is
staring out the window. The doctor is clearly late. The boy
checks his watch. He stares out the window again. His phone

rings.

A beat.

MARTIN
Yes. Where are you? I called you a
hundred times, didn’t you see my
calls? Yes I’m here, I’ve eaten
already. Sorry I didn’t wait for
you but I was starving. What do you
mean? What do you mean you can’t? I
got you an apple pie. At least come
for a bit. You have to come. I’ve
been waiting for over half an hour.
Come for a bit. I can come closer
to where you are. Where are you?
Are you at the hospital? I’1l bring
you the apple pie.

MARTIN (CONT'D)
What’s so important? An operation?
Are you at the hospital? What sort
of incident? Not tomorrow, now. Not
tomorrow. I can’t tomorrow, I have
to study. Now. Listen to me. Just a
minute. Where are you?

Another beat.
32

32.

Martin hangs up the phone. He looks annoyed.

EXT. MATTHEW’S HOUSE - GARDEN - DAY

Matthew is grilling pieces of trout on the barbecue. The
garden is immaculate. At the back of the large, suburban
house is a wooden deck. Anna is helping the anaesthetist’s
wife, MARY, a woman of around 55, to set the table. Steven
emerges from the house and sits in a chair. He looks ill at
ease. He picks up a glass of wine and holds it in his hand,
but doesn’t drink.

ANNA
Where were you?
STEVEN
I was inside, making a phone call.
MATTHEW
The fish is almost ready. Pass me a
plate.
STEVEN

Do you need a hand?

MATTHEW
No, that’s okay. I forgot to tell
you. I saw that boy yesterday. Your
son’s friend.

STEVEN
Martin?

MATTHEW
Yes, right. Martin. I couldn’t
remember his name.

STEVEN
Where did you see him?

MATTHEW
At the hospital. He was hanging
around beside your car. It looked
like he was waiting for you. I said
hello, but he pretended not to see

me.

STEVEN
That's impossible. It can’t have
been him.

MATTHEW

Maybe I was mistaken. But it looked
a lot like him.
33

33.

STEVEN
You should go see Anna and get your
eyes checked. Take my piece off the
grill, will you? I don’t like it
overdone.

INT. STEVEN’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Steven is sitting on the sofa, stroking the dog. He is eating

a sandwich. He feeds the dog some ham. The door opens and Kim
walks in.

KIM
Hi, Dad.

STEVEN
Hello, darling. Where have you
been?

KIM

Choir practice.

STEVEN
Have you eaten?

KIM
Yes, I ate earlier.

STEVEN
You don’t have to take the dog for
a walk. I took him out already. We
got back a little while ago.

KIM
Okay.

She puts her bag down by the door.

KIM (CONT'D)
Dad, do you know who I saw today?

STEVEN
Who, darling?

KIM
Martin.

STEVEN

Martin who?

KIM
Martin. That boy who came over the
other day, the son of your ex-
patient. He brought me back from
choir practice on his friend’s
motorbike. He’s really funny. I
laughed so hard my ribs hurt.
34

35

34.

STEVEN
Yes, he is very funny. Kim, I don’t
want you riding on motorbikes
without a helmet.

KIM
I was wearing a helmet. He gave me
his.

STEVEN

Why didn’t you ask him to come in?

KIM
I did, but he was in a hurry. He
had to get home. Where’s Mum?

STEVEN
She's taking a shower. Is there
something you need?

KIM
I’m going up to bed.

She kisses Steven and leaves.

STEVEN
Good night.

EXT. STEVEN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Martin is standing on the pavement opposite Steven’s house.
He watches the house with a blank expression that betrays no
emotion. He is holding a helmet under his arm. His friend’s
motorbike is parked beside him. It’s a red HONDA CRF. The
light in the living room goes off.

INT. STEVEN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN —- MORNING

Steven, Anna and Kim are having breakfast. Bob is not there.
Steven seems agitated.

KIM
“Good evening. Anna Murphy Eye
Clinic, how may I help you?”

ANNA
“Good evening. I’d like to make an
appointment.”

KIM
“When for?”

ANNA
“Certainly. Of course. When would
you like to come in?”
36

35.

KIM
“Certainly, when would you like to
come in?”

ANNA

“Today. It’s urgent.”

KIM
“Today is impossible.”

ANNA
“Please describe your symptoms.”
Then you come and talk to me and I
tell you whether it’s urgent or
not. Meanwhile, you ask them to
hold while you check to see whether
any appointments are available.

STEVEN
Did you wake up Bob?

ANNA
I did. He just likes lying in bed
for a bit before he gets up. Leave
him be. Should I squeeze some more
orange juice?

STEVEN
He’ll be late. Have you seen the
time? The school bus will be here
any minute.

Steven gets up and goes to get Bob out of bed.

INT. STEVEN'S HOUSE - BOB'S BEDROOM - MORNING

Bob is sitting on the edge of his bed. As soon as his father
enters the room, Bob turns to look at him. His face is pale.
He looks a little frightened.

STEVEN
Robert, do you have any idea what
time it is? Get up and get dressed.

BOB
I can’t get up.

STEVEN
You have ten minutes to get washed,
dressed and eat your breakfast. I’m
not going to drive you to school
and neither is your mother.

BOB
I can’t get up.
37

38

39

36.

STEVEN
Bob. Get up and get dressed and
stop messing about.

Steven goes to leave the room.

BOB
Dad. My legs. They’re numb. I can’t
move them. I can’t stand up.

Bob is on the verge of tears.

INT. STEVEN'S HOUSE - GARAGE - MORNING

The garage door opens automatically. Steven lifts his son
into the car. Anna helps him. She closes the back door of the
car and then gets into the driver's seat.

EXT. HOSPITAL ENTRANCE —- MORNING

Steven lifts Bob out of the car. He puts a hand around his
shoulder and practically carries his son into the hospital.
Anna follows them inside.

INT. HOSPITAL - NEUROLOGIST’S OFFICE - MORNING

DR. ANDREW NICHOLS, a neurologist, is examining Bob. The boy
is lying on a hospital bed. His shoes are off. Steven is
sitting in a chair, watching the whole procedure. He tries to
crack a joke to reassure his son.

STEVEN
I hope you washed your feet
yesterday, Bob, because Dr. Nichols
punishes boys who don’t wash
between their toes. He gives them
injections with big fat needles.

DR. NICHOLS
Bob's feet are just fine and he has
lovely hair and he is very brave.
He’s all grown up now. You know I
had long hair when I was little,
too. Just like Bob.

STEVEN
I didn’t know that. Really?

DR. NICHOLS
Yes, really. Only mine was curlier.
Now then Bob, I want you to tell me
where you are.
40

37.

BOB
I’m at the hospital. In the
neurology department.

DR. NICHOLS
That's absolutely right. And what
day is it today?

BOB
Thursday.

DR. NICHOLS
Okay then. With this pin, I’m going
to touch the soles of your feet and
all your toes. I want you to tell
me if you can feel it. Don’t be
scared, I’m not going to prick you,
I’m just going to touch you. Okay?

Bob nods.

DR. NICHOLS (CONT’D)
Perfect.

Bob can feel the pin under all his toes.

DR. NICHOLS (CONT’D)
Perfect. Now, look directly into my
eyes for this one. As soon as you
see a finger move, point to it.

The neurologist spreads out his hands and fingers. Bob looks
him in the eye without moving his head. Dr. Nichols moves a
finger on the left, then a finger on the right, then both
fingers together. Bob points to the correct fingers every
time.

DR. NICHOLS (CONT’D)
Okay, good. Now I’m going to test
your sensations. I want you to tell
me if this feels the same on both
sides.

He touches Bob on the left and right cheek, the left and
right ear, the left and right temple. Bob nods each time.

DR. NICHOLS (CONT’D)
Now close your eyes as tight as you
can. Okay. Show me your teeth.
Okay.

INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - MORNING

Anna is waiting in the corridor. Steven and Bob go up to her.
Bob is limping a little, but he can walk.
38.

ANNA
What happened?

STEVEN
Everything is absolutely fine.
Andrew gave him a thorough
neurological examination and he
passed with flying colours. It’s
nothing. You two go home and we’1l
talk tonight. I won’t be late, my
schedule is pretty light today.
Okay?

ANNA
Maybe he should have an MRI.

STEVEN
There’s no need to bother with all
that. He just got scared, that’s
all. He’s absolutely fine. You’re
absolutely fine, aren’t you?

BOB
Yes.

STEVEN
I think there was probably some
test at school today that we
weren’t very well prepared for.

ANNA
Yes, and he preferred to spend his
day at the hospital with Andrew and
us. Let’s go.

BOB
Dad, aren’t you going to show me
your office?

STEVEN
Another time, darling. I have to go
down to the operating theatre right
away.

Steven kisses his son and walks away.
STEVEN (CONT'D)
I've have to go. See you tonight.
Call me if you need anything. Bye
bye.

ANNA
Bye, darling.

Anna leads Bob away.
4l

42

43

39.

INT. HOSPITAL ENTRANCE - MORNING

Anna and Bob are walking towards the exit. The moment they
step outside, Bob collapses to the ground. His mother bends
down and tries to lift him up. She calls for help and two
NURSES rush over. They lift Bob into a wheelchair.

INT. HOSPITAL - MRI SCANNER ROOM - MORNING

Bob is lying inside an MRI machine. Steven and Anna watch
from behind a glass window. Dr. Nichols is taking notes.

INT. HOSPITAL - PATIENT’S ROOM - NIGHT

Bob is sleeping. Anna sits beside him. Steven stands talking
to Matthew. There is a second bed in the room, but it is
empty.

MATTHEW
You don’t have to operate tomorrow.
Cancel everything.

STEVEN
No. Why would I cancel? The
schedule would go haywire. There's
no need. Anyway, it’s nothing.

The door opens and Dr. Nichols walks in.

ANNA
Any news, Andrew?

DR. NICHOLS
MRI and MRA both fine. Blood work
came back good. Cardiogram, chest X-
ray and carotid ultrasound all
clear.

STEVEN
I told you. I knew it.

ANNA
Thank goodness for that.

DR. NICHOLS
Has he been under any psychological
stress lately? Exams at school
maybe?

STEVEN
Yes.

ANNA
No, he wasn’t stressed, he was just
fine. He’s always a bit anxious,
but that’s just the way he is.
40.

DR. NICHOLS
In my opinion, he should stay in
tomorrow as well so that we can
keep an eye on him.

ANNA
Maybe we should give him a PET
scan?

STEVEN

I don’t think there’s any need for
that, do you Andrew? Tomorrow he’1l
be well enough to walk all the way
home.

DR. NICHOLS
Yes, I don’t think that’s necessary
at this point. Let’s see how things
are tomorrow and take it from
there. There’s nothing to worry
about, in my opinion. You go home
and we'll speak tomorrow. I’1l be
here all day. Anna, it was great
seeing you, even under these
circumstances.

ANNA
And you, Andrew. How’s your
daughter?

DR. NICHOLS
She got married last year. I’ma
grandfather now.

ANNA
Give her my love.

DR. NICHOLS
I will. Good night.

STEVEN
Goodbye, Andrew. Thanks for
everything.

MATTHEW

Do you want me to let them know
that you won't be operating
tomorrow?

STEVEN
I said no. Don’t go on about it.

ANNA
That won’t be necessary, Matthew.
I'll come in the morning. I won't
go in to the clinic. I’1l bring him
those cinnamon doughnuts he loves
so much.
44

45

41.

STEVEN
Yes, I’m sure he’1l be thrilled.

EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

Martin is riding his friend’s motorbike. Kim sits behind him,
holding on tight. Neither of them are wearing helmets. Martin
focuses all his attention on the road. Tears are streaming
down Kim’s face, but it’s impossible to tell whether it’s
from the wind or if she’s crying for some other reason.

EXT. STEVEN’S HOUSE - GARDEN - NIGHT

Anna is watering the plants. Kim comes out into the garden.

ANNA
Where were you?
KIM
At Claire’s. Is Dad asleep?
ANNA
Yes.
KIM

How’s Bob?

ANNA
Bob is absolutely fine. They’ve
just kept him in as a precaution.

Kim looks at her mother for a while without saying anything.

KIM
How are you?

ANNA
I’m fine. How do you mean?

KIM
I mean are you tired?

ANNA
I’m absolutely fine. A little
tired, that’s all.

KIM
Okay.

ANNA
See you in the morning. Oh, and
while Bob’s in the hospital, you’1l
be responsible for watering the
plants. Okay?

Kim walks away without answering.
46

47

42.

INT. HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR —- MORNING

Steven, dressed in his white doctor’s coat, and Anna, holding
a box of doughnuts, are walking down the corridor. It is rush
hour at the hospital. They both greet various people as they
walk along.

ANNA
Did he go to the toilet? Did he get
up?

STEVEN

He hadn’t when I passed by about an
hour ago. He didn’t want to.

ANNA
He didn’t want to pee or he hadn’t
got up?

STEVEN

He didn’t want to pee.

ANNA
Could he get up?

STEVEN
He was asleep. I didn’t want to
drag him out of bed.

They stop outside the door to Bob’s room.

INT. HOSPITAL - PATIENT’S ROOM - MORNING

Steven and Anna enter Bob’s room. Martin is already there,
sitting next to Bob’s bed. Martin stands up.

MARTIN
Good morning, Doctor. How are you
Mrs. Murphy? I just came by to see
Bob. Kim told me what happened.

ANNA
Hello, Martin. How nice of you. Hi
darling, good morning. Did your
friend Martin come to see you?

Bob does not reply.

MARTIN
I’1ll leave you alone now so that
you can spend time with him too. I
have to go anyway. I’1ll come by and
see him again some other time, for
sure. I offered to help him go to
the toilet but he didn’t want me to
and he wet the bed. I brought some
lemonade. Mum made it yesterday.

(MORE )
48

43.
MARTIN (CONT'D)
Try it and let me know what you
think.

STEVEN
Thank you very much.

Anna goes over to Bob.

ANNA
Darling, do you know what’s in this
box?

BOB
What?

ANNA

Cinnamon doughnuts, that’s what.

Martin goes over to Steven. Anna pulls off the sheets and
folds them up.

MARTIN
I'll be in the canteen. Come
whenever you can.

STEVEN
I don’t think I’1l have time today,
as you might imagine. We’ll talk
some other time.

MARTIN
No. Today. Come to the canteen.
Just for ten minutes. Don’t stand
me up like last time. Goodbye Mrs.
Murphy. Bye, Bob.

Martin leaves. We hear Anna saying goodbye as we watch him
go.

INT. HOSPITAL CANTEEN - AFTERNOON

Martin is waiting in the hospital canteen. Steven appears.
The canteen is packed with doctors, nurses and patients,
seated at the tables.

MARTIN
Coffee? Apple pie?

STEVEN
I’ve only got ten minutes. I have
to be back upstairs in ten minutes
max.

MARTIN
Okay. I’1l get straight to the
point. I’ve brought you a present.
(MORE )
44,

MARTIN (CONT'D)
You've given me so many presents
and I’ve never given you anything.
I thought that was rude of me. So I
decided to make amends. Close your
eyes.

Steven does not close his eyes.

MARTIN (CONT'D)
Please close your eyes.

Steven, losing patience, closes his eyes. Martin places a
small box in his hand. Steven opens his eyes and sees the
box.

MARTIN (CONT'D)
It’s a Swiss army knife.

The boy puts his hand over his mouth, mortified.

MARTIN (CONT'D)
I shouldn’t have told you that. I
messed it up. I ruined the
surprise. I’m sorry.

STEVEN

Thank you very much, Martin.
MARTIN

What an idiot.
STEVEN

It doesn’t matter. Thank you very

much.
A PARAMEDIC approaches the doctor.

PARAMEDIC
Good afternoon, Doctor.

STEVEN
Hello, Justin.

PARAMEDIC
I got the car. Second-hand, but
still. Blue. I couldn’t find it in
silver.

STEVEN
That’s great. You’ll have to take
me for a ride in it soon.

PARAMEDIC
Yeah, sure. See you later.

The paramedic walks away.
45.

MARTIN
That reminds me, did you do
anything about that motorbike I

wanted?

STEVEN
Martin, I have to get back
upstairs.

MARTIN

All right. I won’t keep you much
longer, even though you are
devoting less and less time to me
lately. But that’s okay, I
understand. I just wanted to say
one more thing. I’m really sorry
about Bob.

STEVEN
It’s nothing serious.

MARTIN
No, it is. That critical moment we
both knew would come someday, well,
here it is. The time is now. You’ll
see, things will be better for us
all after this. You know what I
mean.

STEVEN
No, I don’t. Listen, Martin, I
don’t have time for this. I have to
be upstairs.

Steven stares at Martin in silence. The boy looks around to
make sure nobody can hear them, that nobody is sitting too
close.

MARTIN

(speaking fast, almost

without catching his

breath)
Okay, I’m going to tell you this as
quickly as I can so that I don’t
hold you up since I get that you
don’t have much time and you have
to go back up to the ward. I will
make myself as clear as possible.
Yes, it’s exactly what you think.
Yes. That’s it. Just like you
killed a member of my family, now
you have to kill a member of your
own family. To balance things out,
understand? I’m not going to tell
you who to kill of course, that’s
for you to decide. But if you don’t
do it, they all die. Bob will die.
Kim will die.

(MORE )
46.

MARTIN (CONT'D)
And so will your wife. They will
all get sick and die. One:
paralysis of the limbs, two:
refusal of food to the point of
starvation, three: bleeding from
the eyes, four: death. One, two,
three, four. You’re not going to
get sick, don’t worry. You just
have to stay calm, that’s all.
There, I said it. As quickly as I
could. I hope I haven’t kept you
too long. Oh and one more thing,
but I'll be very quick. You only
have a few days to decide who to
kill. Once stage three kicks in -
remember what stage three is?
Bleeding from the eyes, that’s
stage three - once the bleeding
starts, they die in a matter of
hours. Well, don’t let me keep you.
I have nothing more to say. Unless
you have any questions.

Steven stares at Martin in silence. He is clearly furious. He
picks up his mobile phone and keys.

STEVEN
Get up and get out of here and
don’t you dare come back or call me
ever again. Now. Before I hit you.

MARTIN
All right, I'll go. I have to go
anyway, I have French class to get
to. I was leaving anyway. But don’t
get angry. There’s really no point
getting mad at me. I told you. This
will do us all good. You'll see.

STEVEN
If you ever come anywhere near me,
my wife, or my children again I
will kill you, I swear.

MARTIN
(loudly)
But how will you kill me? Oh wait,
I have an idea. Why don’t you
operate on me?

Several people turn and stare at the doctor. Steven gets up
and leaves. Martin calls after him.

MARTIN (CONT'D)
Do you know if Kim’s going to come
by today?

(MORE )
49

50

47.

MARTIN (CONT'D)
If she does, tell her I’1l be
outside, at the main entrance. I’m
going for a cigarette.

INT. HOSPITAL ENTRANCE - AFTERNOON

Two security guards escort Martin out of the building. He
heads towards the exit without putting up a fight. He glances
over his shoulder and then walks out, zipping up his jacket
and smoothing down his hair.

INT. HOSPITAL - PATIENT’S ROOM - EVENING

Anna is sitting on the empty bed next to her son’s bed. She
is reading him a book. Steven comes in and sits in a chair.
He is restless.

STEVEN
Has he eaten?

ANNA
No, he’s not hungry.

STEVEN
What do you mean he’s not hungry?

ANNA
He’s not hungry.

Steven takes a doughnut out of the box. He reaches over and
puts it near his son’s mouth.

STEVEN
Come on, darling. Eat a doughnut.

BOB
I don’t want it, dad.

STEVEN
You do, but you're afraid that your
mother and I will tell you off for
eating doughnuts. Come on, eat it.
You have my permission. You have
our permission. It’s okay for him
to eat a doughnut, isn’t it Anna?

ANNA
Yes.

STEVEN
You heard your mother. Eat it.

He prises Bobs lips open and shoves the whole doughnut into
his mouth. Anna gets up and pulls Steven away from their son.
51

48.

ANNA
Leave him alone. He doesn’t want it
now. He’ll eat it later.

Steven does not back down. He gestures for Anna to sit back
down.

STEVEN
That’s right. Chew it a bit. Now
swallow.

Bob spits the doughnut out.

ANNA
Leave him alone. He said he doesn’t
want it now.

STEVEN
He is going to eat it right now. He
is completely run down, that’s why
he keeps falling over and crawling
around on all fours. He’s going to
eat them, all of them. In five
minutes flat, I want to see this
whole box empty.

Steven storms out of the room, slamming the door behind him
as he goes.

INT. HOSPITAL - DIRECTOR’S OFFICE - NIGHT

Steven, Anna, Dr. Nichols and the HOSPITAL DIRECTOR are
discussing Bob’s case. A FEMALE DOCTOR is standing beside
them, along with Matthew. They have spread all of Bob’s test
results out on the desk. The Hospital Director studies the
test results thoroughly, in silence.

ANNA
He stopped eating today. He keeps
vomiting.

The Hospital Director looks up at Anna and then looks back at
the test results.

STEVEN
Some of the tests need to be done
again, in my opinion. They haven't
found anything, it’s not possible.

ANNA
It’s been less than a day since his
last tests. I don’t think the
results will be any different. To
be honest, I think what we have
here is a clear case of some
psychosomatic disorder.
52

53

49,

HOSPITAL DIRECTOR
I’m inclined to agree with Anna.

STEVEN
What do you mean? Shouldn’t we rule
out all possible causes before we
resort to the easy option of a
psychosomatic disorder?

DR. NICHOLS
We already have ruled out
everything else.

HOSPITAL DIRECTOR
I think with psychiatric treatment
and psychological support
everything will be fine. He will
walk again and eat just fine.

ANNA
Of course he will.

STEVEN
Anna, if Bob was short-sighted or
had a cataract or glaucoma, then
your opinion really would be
valuable. But thankfully Bob’s
eyesight is perfect. And I can
honestly say that if he ever needed
glasses, you'd be the first person
I'd consult. But right now the boy
can’t eat and is paralysed in both
legs, so I’m afraid I’m not
remotely interested in your medical
opinion.

Nobody says a word. Anna opens the door and leaves the room.

INT. STEVEN'S HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT

Kim puts on lipstick and brushes her hair in front of the
mirror. She then sprays herself with a little too much
perfume.

INT. STEVEN'S HOUSE - KIM’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Kim and Martin are sitting on the bed, kissing. The bedroom
lights are on. Music is playing on the computer. Kim’s bed is
made. Martin touches her breast.

MARTIN
Are you on your period?

KIM
No. If you’re hungry we can order
something later.

(MORE )
54

50.

KIM (CONT'D)
My parents will be home late and
they’ve left me some money.

MARTIN
I’m not hungry.

Kim stands up, strips down to her underwear and lies on the
bed, beneath her swimsuit picture. Martin smiles.

They kiss.

MARTIN (CONT'D)
You are the prettiest girl I’ve
ever met. Your mother is making a
big mistake not trusting you to
work at the clinic. A huge mistake.

MARTIN (CONT'D)
I'm afraid I have to go.

KIM
Why? Stay a bit longer. We can
listen to some music.

MARTIN
I can’t, Kim. It’s late.

KIM
Are you mad at me because of my
dad?

MARTIN

Don’t be stupid. I’m not mad at you
at all. And I thought I’d made
myself clear - I don’t feel angry
at him, I feel sorry for him. I
have to go because it’s late,
that’s all. It’s as simple as that.
Don’t be annoying, I thought you

understood.

KIM
I’m sorry. Martin, I love you so
much.

He hugs her but does not say it back.

INT. HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Anna is marching angrily down the corridor. Steven follows
her, holding a file of papers.

STEVEN
I’m sorry about what happened in
there.
55

56

57

51.

ANNA
It doesn’t matter.
STEVEN
I’m just so exhausted and stressed
and...
ANNA
(interrupting)
It’s okay.
STEVEN

You go home. I’m staying here.

ANNA
What do you mean?

STEVEN
I’m going to give him all the tests
again. Every single one of them.
I’m staying here. Go home.

ANNA
Let’s go home and we'll talk it
over again tomorrow.

STEVEN
Just go. Go to Kim, she’s by
herself. I’1l come later. Go.

ANNA
Good night.

Anna stands there watching Steven as he goes back towards the
patients’ ward.

INT. HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR - NIGHT
Steven pushes Bob along in a wheelchair. Bob looks groggy.

He’s half asleep. Steven marches manically up and down the
hospital corridors.

INT. HOSPITAL - BLOOD TEST ROOM - NIGHT

Steven takes blood from Bob. He gives the blood sample to a
nurse.

INT. HOSPITAL - MRI SCANNER ROOM - NIGHT

Bob is lying inside the MRI machine. He disappears into the
machine as Steven watches.
58

59

52.

INT. HOSPITAL - ULTRASOUND ROOM - NIGHT

Tired but wired, Steven stands next to a doctor who is giving
Bob an abdominal ultrasound.

DOCTOR
Take a deep breath and hold it for
a few seconds. Good.

INT. HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Steven pushes Bob back to his room in the wheelchair. Bob is
shattered, so is Steven. Abruptly, Steven stops pushing the
wheelchair, lifts Bob up with both hands, puts his arms
around him and walks him down the corridor, with the drip
trailing behind them. Steven lets go of Bob and he falls to
the floor. Steven picks him up again. He kneels down in front
of his son.

STEVEN

Bob, why don’t we play a game?
BOB

What game?
STEVEN

I'll tell you a secret, something
I’ve never told you before, and
then you’1ll tell me one. And
whoever tells the best secret wins.
Okay? When I was your age I'd just
started masturbating and I’d only
just started ejaculating. Only a
little, barely a drop. I was
worried that I had some kind of
problem because at school I'd heard
all sorts of stories. Then one day
when my father had had a lot to
drink and my brothers were out and
he was sleeping in the bedroom, I
crept inside, put my hand on his
penis and started stroking it until
he ejaculated. The sheets got
covered in sperm. I got scared and
ran out. I’ve never told anybody
that before. Now it’s your turn to
tell me a secret.

Bob stares at his father, dumbstruck. An awkward silence.

BOB
I don’t know. I don’t have one.

STEVEN
That's impossible, you must have
one.
60

53.

BOB
I don’t.

STEVEN
Bob, if all this is just an act,
you should know that if you tell me
now, I won't punish you and neither
will your mother. We won’t be angry
with you either.

BOB
It’s not an act.

STEVEN
But if it is an act and you don’t
stop this stupid joke right this
minute, your punishment won't just
be no TV for a month. I will take
my electric shaver and I will shave
your head and I will make you eat
your hair. I mean it, I will
literally make you eat your hair.
I’m not kidding.

BOB
It’s not an act.

Steven puts Bob back into the wheelchair in silence.

INT. STEVEN'S OFFICE - HOSPITAL - MORNING

Steven is asleep at his desk. His hair is tousled and his tie
is undone. The door opens and Anna walks in. Steven wakes up.
Anna hands him a takeaway coffee. They don’t say anything.
Steven has nothing to report.

ANNA
I brought you a clean shirt.

She takes a shirt out of her bag and hangs it up inside the
locker where Steven keeps his lab coat.

STEVEN
Thank you.

ANNA
Anything to tell me?

Steven shakes his head.
ANNA (CONT'D)

Hungry? Want me to bring you
something to eat?
61

62

63

64

54.

STEVEN
No, thank you. Maybe you were
right. Maybe it’s all
psychological.

ANNA
Everything will be all right,
you'll see. Trust me. We’re in this
together and everything will be all
right. Let’s go and get you
something to eat and some fresh air
and then we’ll go up and see the
little one.

INT. SCHOOL - REHEARSAL ROOM —- DAY

Kim is singing in the choir. A middle-aged man, the
CHOIRMASTER, is conducting the orchestra. Suddenly, Kim falls
down. At first, everybody around her carries on singing. As
fear ripples through the choir, everyone gradually falls
silent and the music stops. The choirmaster rushes over to
see what has happened.

INT. HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR - AFTERNOON

Anna is sitting outside Bob’s room, crying. Matthew hugs her.
A nurse comes out of the room, pushing a food trolley.

INT. HOSPITAL - PATIENT’S ROOM - AFTERNOON

Kim and Bob are lying in adjacent beds. Steven is feeding Kim
pieces of fruit. Kim spits them out. Bob watches them, slowly
opening and closing his eyes. He looks as if he has just

woken up. Their dinner plates lie untouched on trays.

KIM
Dad, I don’t want any fruit.

STEVEN
Just one bite. For me.

Kim chokes and her face flushes. She spits out the piece of
apple that Steven has fed her.
INT. HOSPITAL - PATIENT’S ROOM - EVENING

A nurse inserts nasogastric feeding tubes into the noses of
both children. Kim has calmed down, but looks exhausted.

KIM
I want to sleep.
65

55.

STEVEN
All right, darling. What are you
going to wear to Claire’s party,
did you decide yet?

KIM
No. I’m tired, Dad. Switch off the
light.

Steven goes to turn the light off. He spots a new MP3 player
on the bedside table.

STEVEN
Where did you get this? Did Mum
give it to you?

KIM
No. Martin did. He made me a
playlist with some songs that he
likes. That we both like.

STEVEN

When did he give you this?
KIM

I don’t remember. Good night, Dad.
STEVEN

Good night.

EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

Steven sits in his car, thinking. He opens the car door, gets
out, and walks quickly and angrily across the road. He is
outside Martin’s house. He sees a light on in the living
room. The TV is blaring. Steven goes up to the front door and
rings the doorbell frantically. Nobody answers. He bangs on
the door with his fists.

STEVEN
Open the door. I know you’re in
there. Open the door or I will
smash it down. Martin. Open the
door or I will smash it down and I
will fuck you and your mother just
the way you wanted.

Steven tries to break in through the balcony doors, but
doesn’t succeed.

STEVEN (CONT'D)

If anything happens to my kids or
my wife, you'll die in prison, do
you hear me? You’ll die in prison.
56.

EXT. HOSPITAL GROUNDS - NIGHT

Anna is sitting on the steps outside the hospital. Steven
stands beside her. He appears rather sheepish and speaks in a
low voice. He avoids looking Anna in the eye.

ANNA
How old was his father when he
died?

STEVEN
46.

ANNA

Had you been drinking that day?

STEVEN
He had an arrhythmia, a stroke, and
that was it.

ANNA
I asked whether you’d been
drinking, not how he died. How long
has this been going on? How long
have you been seeing this boy?

STEVEN
About six months.

ANNA
Where were you meeting?

STEVEN
What does it matter?

ANNA
Where were you meeting him?

STEVEN
At a Burger King, then we'd drive
to the seaside. He’s got issues,
serious psychological issues. He
always did. I knew he acted weird
sometimes, but now he’s lost it
completely, he’s become dangerous.
We have to take precautions. Go to
the police and take some
precautions.

ANNA
You're not going to the police.
You're not going to tell anyone.
There’s no point. We’1ll wait and
see. Had you been drinking when you
operated on his father?
67

68

69

57.

STEVEN
Only a little. That had nothing to
do with the outcome. A surgeon
never kills a patient. An
anaesthetist can kill a patient,
but a surgeon never can. For
example, Matthew has made mistakes
that led to the death of a patient,
but I never have.

Anna turns her head away. She doesn’t say anything.

STEVEN (CONT'D)
I think Bob is a little better
today. He seemed in a better mood
and he wasn’t so pale.

Anna does not respond.

ANNA
Why didn’t you tell me you were
seeing him?

STEVEN
At first I didn’t see him that
often, it was only recently that we
started meeting more regularly. I
was going to tell you at some
point. I felt sorry for him. I gave
him some money. His mum is out of
work.

ANNA
I’m going upstairs.

Anna gets up and leaves. Steven stands there for a while,
alone with his thoughts. Then he follows his wife into the
hospital.

INT. STEVEN’S HOUSE- BATHROOM - DAY

Steven takes a shower.

INT. STEVEN'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY

Steven sits on the edge of his bed, naked and numb. His gaze
is vacant - he looks completely blank. The room is relatively
dark. The curtains are drawn. Steven stands up and hurriedly
gets dressed.

EXT. STEVEN'S HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - DAY
Steven emerges from the front door of his house and finds an

envelope on the doormat, with his name written on it. He
opens the envelope.
70

58.

Inside is the watch he had given Martin, with a note. One of
the watch straps is missing. Snapped off. Steven looks inside
the envelope for the missing piece of leather, but it is not
there. The note, written in very neat handwriting, reads:

“Time shows no mercy. By the way, you were right. Metal
straps are better. Leather straps break.”

INT. HOSPITAL - PATIENT’S ROOM - DAY

Anna is sitting next to Bob’s bed. Kim is lying on her back
on the other bed. She is playing a game on her mobile phone.
Her legs are covered from the knees up with a sheet. Her toes
are pointed. Exhausted, Anna rests her head on the metal bed
frame. She strokes Bob’s legs.

BOB
When are we going home?

ANNA
Tomorrow or the day after. We’1ll
get all our tests done and when the
doctors say so, we can go home.

BOB
But you are doctors too. Tell them
we can go home.

ANNA
We'll tell them, darling.

Kim interrupts the conversation.
KIM
Mum, did Martin come by while I was
sleeping?

Anna stands up and looks at her daughter.

ANNA
No.

KIM
Can you turn me onto my side,
please?

Anna goes over, turns Kim onto her side and returns to her
chair. Kim has her back to her mother now. They cannot make
eye contact.

KIM (CONT'D)
What time is it?

ANNA
Nine.
59.

KIM
Is Dad here?

ANNA
No, he’ll be here soon. Would you
like me to fetch you some juice?

KIM
No. Don’t go anywhere. Stay here.

Silence. Kim’s phone rings. She picks it up.

KIM (CONT'D)
Good morning. How are you? Aren’t
you coming by? Okay. Just my mum,
my father will be here soon. Yes.
You're here? I can’t. Are you
coming up to see me?

(Kim laughs)
You really think that’s possible?
Well, let’s see. Okay. Okay.

Kim’s toes uncurl. Her legs slowly start to move. Kim pulls
herself up and sits on the bed. She then stands up and walks
over to the window.

KIM (CONT'D)
Martin? Yes, I stood up. Yes, thank
you. Can you see me? Yes, I’m at
the window, I’m standing at the
window. Can you see me?

Kim waves with her right hand. Then she smoothes her hair
down with both hands.

KIM (CONT'D)
I can’t see you, can you see me?
I’m waving at you. Can you see me
waving? Great. Yes.

Anna gets up and walks over to the window.

BOB
Mum, I want to stand up like Kim.
Why can she get up and I can’t?

KIM
All right. I’m going back to bed
now. I’m lying down now. Okay.
Thank you. Me too. Next time you
come, call me first so that I’m not
sleeping. I’1l tell them. Me too.
Bye.

As Kim lies down, her legs seize up again and her toes curl
back into the soles of her feet. Anna looks out of the
window. She scans the people in the street, but she cannot
see Martin. Bob falls out of bed.
60.

BOB
Mum, I’m coming over to the window.

Anna rushes over, picks Bob up, and puts him back into bed.

ANNA
You'll be able to soon, my darling.
Kim is older than you, that’s why
she can do it. Soon you’1l be
strong enough to stand up too.

Anna turns to look at Kim, who has her back to them and her
face pressed up against the window.

ANNA (CONT'D)
Who were you talking to?

KIM
Martin. He sends his regards.

ANNA
I don’t want you talking with him
ever again.

KIM
Why?

ANNA
Because I said so.

Kim does not respond.

ANNA (CONT'D)
Did you hear what I said?

KIM
(under her breath)
Fuck you.
ANNA

What did you say?

KIM
I didn’t say anything.

ANNA
Yes you did. What did you say, Kim?

Anna grabs her daughter with both hands and shakes her hard.
Kim cries out in pain.

KIM
Mum, let go, you’re hurting me. I
didn’t say anything.

Anna lets Kim fall abruptly back down on the bed.
71

61.

ANNA
I’m not like your father. You
better watch your mouth. If that’s
the way you want it, I’m
confiscating your phone right here
and now. That’1ll teach you to be
rude to your mother.

KIM
Give me my phone back. Please.

ANNA
You can forget it.

A long beat of silence.

KIM
Don’t be scared, mum. Don’t get
hysterical. It’s not that tragic.
Sometimes your body hurts from not
moving and you can’t sleep, that’s
all. The important thing is to make
sure you have everything you need
within reach. That’s all. You’1l
see. You won’t be able to move
either, but you'll get used to it.

Anna stares at her speechless and her anger morphs into fear.

INT. HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR - AFTERNOON

Anna is talking to Steven. She is upset. He hugs her and
tries to calm her down.

STEVEN
You’re tired. Go home and rest. I’m
here now.

ANNA

I’m not tired. I’m telling you the
truth, I really saw it happen.

STEVEN
It was just a coincidence.

ANNA
How can it be a coincidence? How
come neither of them have been able
to get up and walk until now?

STEVEN
Darling, listen to yourself.

ANNA
I saw it.
72

73

74

62.

STEVEN
Okay. It just means things are
getting better. That’s all it
means. That Kim is getting better.
Go home and rest for a bit. Please.

ANNA
They’re not better. They’re worse.

STEVEN
This afternoon there’ 11 be an
emergency meeting of the medical
board. Andrew and I took the
initiative of inviting two
outstanding specialists from the
Presbyterian University Hospital of
Columbia. They’ve already arrived
from New York and I’m meeting them
this afternoon to brief them about
the case. One of them is actually a
personal friend of the director.
Dr. Johnston. You must have heard
of him. He’s the best there is when
it comes to paralytic disorders.

ANNA
Yes.

EXT. ANNA’S CAR — AFTERNOON

Anna is driving. We can sense that contradicting thoughts are
going through her mind.

EXT. MARTIN'S HOUSE - AFTERNOON

Anna pulls over outside Martin’s house. She looks at the
house, trying to figure out whether anyone is home. She takes
a deep breath and gets out of the car. She hesitates for a
moment, looks around, then carries on walking up to the front
door of Martin’s house.

EXT. MARTIN'S HOUSE - AFTERNOON

Martin opens the front door. He is home alone. He is wearing
a T-shirt and boxer shorts and holding a plate of spaghetti.
His hair is wet and freshly combed.

ANNA
Good evening. I’m not sure if you
remember me.

MARTIN
Of course I remember you. How are
you? Come in.
63.

ANNA
Thank you.

75 INT. MARTIN'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON

Anna sits on the sofa. Martin brings her a glass of iced
water.

ANNA
Thank you very much. I'd like to
have a talk with you. I won’t take
up much of your time.

MARTIN
Of course. I’ve only got ten
minutes because I have to get to my
French class. What’s up?

ANNA
My husband told me about you and
your father.

Martin puts his plate of spaghetti down on the table. He
looks at Anna and smiles faintly.

MARTIN

Did he also tell you about my mum?
ANNA

No.
MARTIN

I’m sorry, then maybe I’m not the
one you should hear it from. Ever
since your husband killed my
father, he’s been flirting with my
mother constantly. To be honest,
she has feelings for him too. She
really likes your husband's hands
and the truth is he does have very
beautiful hands. All doctors have
nice, clean hands. You see, now
that we only have each other, my
mother and I are friends and we
tell each other everything. So I
told her that I have no problem if
she wants to go ahead with it, and
anyway, he seems like a nice guy.
Why would I stand in the way of her
trying to get her life back on
track? I mean, I'll be gone ina
few years. I’1l get a job and I'll
be gone.
76

64.

ANNA
Look, if my husband made a mistake,
if out of negligence or I don’t
know what he somehow caused this
tragic thing to happen, I don’t
understand why my children and I
have to pay the price.

Martin picks up his plate of spaghetti.

MARTIN
Not long after my dad died, someone
told me that I eat spaghetti in
exactly the same way he did, told
me what an extraordinary impression
this fact had made on him. “Look
how the boy eats spaghetti,” he
said. “Exactly the same way his
father did. He sticks his fork in
and twirls it around and around
until the spaghetti is all twisted
up and then he puts it in his
mouth.” At the time, I thought I
was the only one who ate spaghetti
like that. Only my dad and me. I
realised later, of course, that
everyone eats spaghetti that way.
They all stick their fork in and
twirl it around.

Martin stands up.

MARTIN (CONT'D)
I was really upset when I realised
that, maybe even more upset than
when they announced to me that he
was dead. I don’t know if what is
happening is fair, but it’s the
closest thing to justice I can
think of. But enough chit chat,
time's getting on and if I’m late
for class I’m done for. You have a
good day.

INT. HOSPITAL - MEETING ROOM - NIGHT

The medical council is underway. Anna, Steven, Matthew, the
Hospital Director and Dr. Nichols are all present, as are the
VISITING CONSULTANTS. Anna looks defeated. She sits in a
chair with her arms folded and watches the proceedings
without saying a word. We cannot hear what is being said. We
watch the scene unfold through a window.
77

65.

EXT. HOSPITAL ENTRANCE - NIGHT

The Hospital Director is saying goodbye to the visiting
consultants. Steven and Anna also say goodbye. The
consultants get into a car and drive off. The Hospital
Director gives Steven a hug and pats him on the back.

HOSPITAL DIRECTOR
So, I don’t see any reason for the
children to stay in hospital.

STEVEN
You mean you think you’ve done
everything you can?

HOSPITAL DIRECTOR
Yes, Steven, I believe we have done
everything we can.

STEVEN
Sorry, but if I was running this
hospital I would feel like a
complete failure. A loser. I
wouldn’t be able to sleep at night.

The Hospital Director looks at Steven then walks away.

HOSPITAL DIRECTOR
Good night, Anna.

ANNA
Good night, Ed.

Anna looks at her husband.

ANNA (CONT'D)
I suggest you sign the release
forms tomorrow and then they can go
home.

INT. HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Anna marches angrily along the corridor. Steven follows,
trying to catch up. Suddenly, Anna falls over. Steven panics.
Anna gets back up.

ANNA
I tripped. It’s nothing. My
shoelace was undone. I tripped.

She gets up and carries on walking, leaving Steven standing
there. She is almost running.
79

66.

INT. CAFETERIA —- MORNING

Anna is sitting at a table, waiting. The cafeteria is almost
empty. It doesn’t seem like the kind of place where Anna
would normally choose to go. She is well dressed, but looks
drained. Matthew comes over to the table. He kisses Anna on
the cheek and sits opposite her. She wavers for a moment
before she starts speaking.

MATTHEW
Good evening, Anna.

ANNA
Good evening, Matthew. Sorry to
bother you.

MATTHEW
It’s no bother, really.

ANNA
As I said on the phone, I'd rather
Steven didn’t find out about us
meeting like this.

MATTHEW
He won’t. I’m listening.

ANNA
Four years ago, you were operating
as a team, weren’t you? I mean four
years ago, you were the
anaesthetist on some of Steven’s
operations?

MATTHEW
Of course.

ANNA
Were you the anaesthetist for
Jonathan Lang?

Matthew leans back in his chair and pretends rather
unconvincingly that he is trying to place the patient’s name.
The waiter arrives with the coffee that Anna has ordered.
Their conversation is interrupted.

MATTHEW
A gin and tonic, please.

The waiter leaves.

MATTHEW (CONT'D)
Who’s Jonathan Lang?

ANNA
Male, 46 years old, one of Steven's
patients. He died on the operating
table.
67.

MATTHEW
Anna, there have been so many
patients over the years, so many
operations. I don’t remember him,
I’m afraid. I’m sorry.

ANNA
Can you find his file in the
records and bring it to me, please?
I'll give it straight back to you.
I just want to have a look at his
medical history. And the cause of
death.

MATTHEW
I don’t think that will be
possible. I’m sorry, Anna. I can’t
just take a file from the hospital.
Why do you need it?

ANNA
Please.

MATTHEW
Look, I can’t bring you the file
but I can tell you a couple of
things about the case. I remember
him now, I put him under. But what
do I get in return?

ANNA
What you didn’t get that day we
came for lunch.

MATTHEW
When?
ANNA
Now. Had Steven been drinking?
MATTHEW
Yes.
ANNA

Can it be considered his mistake?

MATTHEW
Yes. It definitely wasn’t mine,
that’s for sure. You know an
anaesthetist is never to blame for
the bad outcome of an operation.
The surgeon is responsible. He’d
had two drinks that morning before
we went in to prepare. Luckily none
of the others realised, I was the
only one who knew. But that wasn’t
exactly unusual back then.

(MORE )
80

81

82

83

68.

MATTHEW (CONT'D)
You know that. He was drunk during
almost every operation.

ANNA
Do you remember Lang’s case
history?

Matthew leans forward in his chair again and rests his arms
on the table.

EXT. DESERTED ROAD - MORNING

Matthew’s car is parked on a deserted road on the edge of
town. There are no pedestrians and very few cars. Anna stares
straight ahead as she jerks off the anaesthetist. He pushes
his seat back to the reclining position. As soon as he comes,
he pulls the chair forward, starts the engine, and they drive
off.

EXT. STEVEN’S HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - AFTERNOON

The front door is open. The children are being carried into
the house with the help of two paramedics. Steven seems
fairly optimistic as he manically rushes about, supervising
the procedure.

INT. KIM’'S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON

Kim's bedroom has been rearranged to accommodate both the
children’s beds. The room is bright, the curtains have been
pulled back to let in the sunlight. Anna changes the feeding
solution in Bob and Kim’s Levin tubes.

INT. STEVEN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

Steven and Anna are having dinner. He is the only one eating.
Anna toys with the wedges of potato on her plate with her
fork. Steven watches her intently, trying to get a reaction,
but she remains stubbornly silent. Steven fills Anna’s glass
with wine. She does not say thank you.

STEVEN
This meat is delicious.

His wife does not respond.

STEVEN (CONT'D)
You were right after all. The
children are much better off here.
I was even thinking we might take
them to the beach house for a few
days. A little fresh air anda
change of scenery might do us all
good.
69.

Anna looks up and stares at her husband, as if she were
observing him for the first time.

ANNA
One of these days you’re going to
have to go in to their school and
excuse their absence. They want you
to sign some papers. They've called
lots of times.

STEVEN
I will. You know what I’ve been
craving? Mashed potatoes. Why don’t
you make some tomorrow?

ANNA
You've got beautiful hands. I'd
never noticed before. Everyone's
been telling me lately what
beautiful hands you have and now I
can see it for myself. Nice and
clean. But so what if they’re
beautiful? They’re lifeless.
Sometimes, Steven, you’re just an
incompetent man with hands that
don’t move who just goes on and on,
saying stupid things. “Let’s do a
scan, let’s do a gastroscopy, let’s
make mashed potatoes, let’s wear
brown socks, let’s go to the beach
house.”

STEVEN
Excuse me?

ANNA
Our two children are dying in their
beds but yes, I can make you mashed
potatoes tomorrow.

STEVEN
Please don’t talk to me that way.

ANNA
If you don’t like it why don’t you
go and live with Martin’s mother, I
bet she’d talk to you nicer.

Steven does not take the bait.

STEVEN
You wanted the kids to come home
and they’re home. What else do you
want me to do?

ANNA
Do something to put an end to all
this, that’s what.

(MORE )
84

70.

ANNA (CONT'D)
That’s what I want. Can you do
that? You do realise Steven that
we've ended up in this situation
because of you?

STEVEN
So what do you suggest? Tell me.
Oh, wait, I know, I’ve got it.
There is a way that we can put a
stop to all this. All we need to do
is find the tooth of a baby
crocodile, the blood of a pigeon,
and the pubes of a virgin and then
we just have to burn them all
before sunset. Let me see, do we
have any spare teeth lying around?

Steven starts opening cupboards and flinging packets of food
onto the floor.

STEVEN (CONT'D)
Teeth, pubes, nope, nothing in
here, or here. Nothing in this box
either. Where are they? I was sure
they were here somewhere. I put
them here myself. Who keeps moving
things around? Unbelievable. I
don’t supposed you’ve got any pubes
I could have, by any chance? Oh I
forgot, you don’t have any left. We
don’t have any of the things we
need. Well, that’s a shame. I guess
there’s nothing I can do.

Steven stalks out of the room.

INT. STEVEN'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
Steven is setting the alarm clock.

STEVEN
There’s no need for us to argue.
Everything's so difficult already,
there’s no point making it worse.

Anna does not respond. She lies down on the bed without
covering herself up and turns her back to Steven.

STEVEN (CONT'D)
If he was telling the truth,
wouldn't you be sick too? Wouldn't
you be paralysed already? How do
you explain that?
85

86

71.

ANNA
Yes, you're right. Let’s wait a bit
longer until we’re all dead and
then we’‘ll see what you can do
about it. There’s really nothing to
worry about.

A short, awkward beat of silence.

ANNA (CONT'D)
Go to the hospital tomorrow and
pick up some feeding formula for
the children. We’re almost out.

STEVEN
Okay.

Steven turns to look at his wife. Anna turns out the light.
Steven lies beside her in the darkness with his eyes wide
open.

INT. STEVEN'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Steven is standing in the middle of the room, smoking. He is
alone. He sits in an armchair. After a few moments, he stands
up again. Taking care not to make any noise, he picks up his
car keys and coat and quietly shuts the door.

INT. STEVEN'S HOUSE - BEDROOM — MORNING

Anna is lying in bed with her eyes open. Steven enters the
room. He stands beside her. He sits on the edge of the bed
and takes her hand. She does not react.

STEVEN
Good morning.

ANNA
Good morning.

STEVEN
Did you get any sleep?

ANNA
What time is it?

STEVEN
Ten past eight. Get up and come
with me for a moment.

Anna gets up.
87

72.

INT. STEVEN'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - MORNING

Steven and Anna head down to the basement. Steven unlocks the
door. They enter a fairly large room full of random garden
furniture. It is dark and dirty. The light goes on - a small
bulb that faintly illuminates the space - and we see Martin
huddled in a corner. He is sitting in an old armchair. His
feet are bound together with gaffer tape and he is chained to
a pipe in the corner of the room. His hands are tied in front
of him. Martin’s face is bloodied and swollen. There is a
rifle on the table.

Anna looks at Martin and then walks over to the table. She
turns to face Steven.

Anna does not move. She looks at Martin. Martin looks up and
holds her gaze. It’s hard to tell whether he is angry or
afraid. He raises his hand and wipes some blood off the side
of his mouth.

STEVEN
You remember Martin, don’t you? He
came over for a play date, but I
told him the kids are feeling a
little unwell, so he’ll just have
to wait here until they get better.
Anna, go upstairs and make me some
of that lemonade he likes so much,
would you? I’ll stay here and keep
him company. Off you go.

Anna hesitates and then leaves. She closes the basement door
behind her. We hear her footsteps on the stairs.

MARTIN
Let me go. My mother will be
worried sick.

STEVEN
Do you think your mother is proud
of you, Martin? Do you think she is
happy that her beloved son is a
murderer?

MARTIN
Murderer. There’s no need for such
a dramatic, sensational, old-
fashioned word. But if you insist,
the murderer, both in my father’s
case and our current situation, is
not me.

STEVEN
Stop talking.
88

73.

MARTIN
Don’t you understand that you’re
wasting time? You don’t have much
time left.

STEVEN
I said stop talking.

MARTIN
Steven, you’ll feel better once
it’s done. You can start over, a
clean slate, don’t you get it?
Sometimes I think you might just be
a fool who can’t understand the
significance of the gift I am
offering. Sometimes I think you’re
naive. But you can’t be. You’re a
good scientist, you can’t be an
idiot. If I’d only just met you I’d
seriously question the depth of
your judgement.

Steven strikes the boy across the face. Martin grabs his hand
and holds it tight.

MARTIN (CONT'D)
Don’t move. I just want to give you
an example, that’s all. I’1l give
you one little example so that you
understand what I mean.

Martin bites Steven’s arm. Blood trickles down his hand.
Steven screams.

MARTIN (CONT'D)
Should I apologise? No. Should I
stroke your wound? No way. That
would probably hurt even more,
touching an open wound. No. There’s
only one way to make you and me
both feel better.

Martin bites his own arm and spits out a small piece of
flesh. His face is contorted with pain but he doesn’t scream.
He tries to remain composed.

MARTIN (CONT'D)
Do you understand? It’s
metaphorical, my example. A
metaphor. I mean, it’s symbolic.

EXT. STEVEN'S HOUSE - GARDEN - MORNING
Anna is scrubbing the blood from the back seat of Steven's

car. The dog watches her but she doesn’t pay him any
attention. We hear a muffled gunshot. The dog starts to bark.
89

90

74.

INT. STEVEN'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - MORNING

Anna opens the door. Steven has shot Martin in the leg. He is
still holding the gun and pointing it at Martin. The boy
writhes in agony.

STEVEN
Shut the door, Anna. Now Martin,
you'll see what it’s like to die.
What it’s like when your head
cracks open and your brains are
blown out.

ANNA
Steven, don’t shoot him.

MARTIN
And then?

STEVEN
Shut up.

MARTIN
Shoot me. Then what? Answer me.

STEVEN
I‘1l bury you in the garden and
you'll decompose. That’s what.

MARTIN
You won’t be able to explain it.
You won’t understand how it could
have happened. You’ll say - “But I
only killed one person, how come
four people are dead? I only shot
one.” You’ll get confused and
you'll start counting again: one,
two, three. But the numbers still
won't add up. If you dig a hole in
the garden, better make it a big
one.

Steven walks over to Martin and puts the gun to his head.
Anna walks up behind Steven and tries to take the gun out of
his hands.

At first Steven doesn’t let go, but Anna whispers something
in his ear and he releases the gun. Anna calmly takes the gun
and walks out of the room.

INT. STEVEN’S HOUSE - KIM'S BEDROOM —- MORNING
Bob is lying in bed. Kim is sitting in a wheelchair, looking

out the window. She lights a cigarette and smokes it. She
coughs a little. Bob winces in pain.
75.

KIM
Does it hurt?

BOB
No. Just a little.

KIM
Just be patient. Dad’s bringing us
some painkillers.

BOB
I know.

KIM
He didn’t kill him.

BOB
How do you know?

KIM
I just do. Anyway, he did the right
thing. Otherwise it would have been
like killing four people with a
single shot. Wouldn’t that be
tragic? I’m going to live with
Martin.

A beat.

KIM (CONT'D)
I want you to know that I’m really
sorry, Bob. I really love you. We
all do. Dad does too. But he’s ina
really difficult position and he
doesn’t have much of a choice. It’s
not because he doesn’t love you.

BOB
They've bought me a piano. Mum told
me it’ll be here next month. They
didn’t tell you so you wouldn’t get
scared.

KIM
Bob, something terrible happened
yesterday. I lost the MP3 player
that Martin gave me. I don’t know
what’s gotten into me, I’ve lost
two MP3 players in ten days. So I'd
like to ask you a favour. Can I
have your MP3 player when you’re
dead? Please. Please. Please.

91 INT. STEVEN'S HOUSE - KIM’S BEDROOM - MORNING

Bob drags himself over to the desk. He struggles to open the
drawer and takes out a pair of scissors.
92

76.

INT. STEVEN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN —- MORNING

Steven gives the dog some food and water and watches him eat.
He notices some blood on his hands and goes over to the sink
to rinse them. Bob enters the room. He drags himself along
the floor. He has cut his own hair. His face and hands are
covered in hair. A Levin tube is inserted into his nose and
he is holding a bag of feeding solution. The dog starts to
bark as soon as he sees Bob.

Bob
Look, dad. I cut my hair like you
wanted me to.

STEVEN
Good boy, well done.

BOB
I’m sorry I didn’t listen to you
and get a haircut right away. I
don’t know what I was thinking all
this time. I would get so hot and I
had to comb it all the time. It was
a total hassle. I should've
listened to you and cut it off
sooner.

Bob drags himself over to the French windows and tries to
open the door.

BOB (CONT'D)
Do you want me to water the plants?

Steven goes to him and hugs him.

STEVEN
No, darling. I watered them this
morning. Tomorrow.

BOB
Dad, I’ve been thinking about it
and I’ve decided I want to be a
cardiologist, not an
ophthalmologist. I lied to mum
because I didn’t want her to get
upset. I think I prefer what you
do, it’s far more interesting and
challenging.

STEVEN
That’s true, Bob. But some people
find ophthalmology more
interesting.

BOB
No. Not to me it isn’t.
93

94

96

77.

INT. - STEVEN'S HOUSE - KIM’S BEDROOM - EVENING

Steven lays his son in his bed. He tucks him in and strokes
his hair.

EXT. STEVEN’S HOUSE - GARDEN - NIGHT

Steven is huddled behind some flowers. He is sobbing.
Eventually, he pulls himself together, wipes his eyes, and
walks towards the house. He closes the French windows and
switches off the living room light.

INT. SCHOOL - CORRIDOR - MORNING

Steven is waiting outside the Headmaster’s office. The
HEADMASTER’'S SECRETARY ushers him inside. Steven gets up and
enters the office.

INT. SCHOOL - HEADMASTER’S OFFICE - MORNING

Steven is sitting in a chair, signing some papers. He gives
them to the HEADMASTER.

HEADMASTER
Sorry for the trouble, dragging you
down here. It’s all just a
formality, but it has to be done.

STEVEN
That’s quite all right. I
understand.

HEADMASTER
All the staff and I personally hope
that all this is only temporary and
that the children will soon be back
at school in good health.

STEVEN
Thank you very much. They’re
already much better now that
they’re back home. They are having
daily physio, we go for walks
together every day, they walk
slowly of course but they are
walking, and they’ve already
started eating properly. However, I
must inform you that they will need
to be off school for a little while
longer.

HEADMASTER
Whatever you think is best. If you
feel they are not in a position to
attend class yet, very well.

(MORE )
78.

HEADMASTER (CONT'D)
However, do bear in mind that in
cases like this it’s generally best
for children not to disrupt their
daily routine for too long.
Attending even some of their
classes might do them good. Of
course, it’s ultimately your
decision. All I can do is share my
thoughts with you.

STEVEN
Thank you very much. But as you
know both my wife and I are
doctors, and we are quite able to
judge when our children are ready
to return to school.

HEADMASTER
Of course. I hope everything works
out well.

STEVEN

I'm very optimistic. Everything
will be fine.

HEADMASTER
That's the spirit.

Steven gets up to go.

STEVEN
Generally speaking, if you had to
compare the two children for some
reason, which of the two would you
consider the better student?

HEADMASTER

Well. The boy is very good at maths
and physics. Kim on the other hand,
apart from her natural aptitude for
music, is pretty good at literature
and history, areas in which Bob
lags behind. She wrote a brilliant
essay on the tragedy of Iphigenia
which she read out in class. At.

STEVEN
What about their behaviour in
class?

HEADMASTER

They're both a little restless,

equally so. I mean I’ve had the

occasional complaint from their

teachers about some minor

misdemeanors, but they’ve never

been rude to any of the staff.
(MORE )
97

79.

HEADMASTER (CONT'D)
In any case, if they had ever acted
in an inappropriate way we would
have informed you about it.

STEVEN
Do you especially like one of them
more than the other? If you had to
choose between them, which would
you say is the best?

HEADMASTER
That's a difficult question. I’m
not sure I can give you an answer.

The Headmaster considers his response for a long time. He
doesn’t know what to say. Steven has put him in an extremely
uncomfortable position. Steven stares at the Headmaster
intently, as if his response has enormous significance.

HEADMASTER (CONT’D)
I don’t know.

He thinks about it some more.

HEADMASTER (CONT’D)
I don’t know what to tell you.

STEVEN
Never mind. Have a good day.

HEADMASTER
Goodbye.

Steven leaves the Headmaster’s office.

INT. STEVEN'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - MORNING

Anna unlocks the door and enters the room, holding Bob in her
arms. Kim drags herself along beside them. Anna has brought
some gauze and disinfectant to change the wound dressing on
Martin’s leg. She washes off the dried blood, then kisses
both his bare feet. Martin just looks at her. The children
watch the procedure from a distance.

MARTIN
Thank you for bringing them down. I
really wanted to see them. I really
wanted to see you. Hi Kim. Hi Bob.
Come over here and let me give you
a kiss.

Kim hobbles over to Martin. He kisses her on the lips. Bob
doesn’t move.

MARTIN (CONT'D)
Bob, aren't you going to come over
and give me a kiss? No?
98

99

80.

ANNA
Bob?

Bob struggles towards the door.

MARTIN
It doesn’t matter, I understand.
You're a man, you are the man of
the house now that your father
isn’t home. Now go back to bed.
Don’t trouble yourselves any more
for my sake. Take them away.

Anna carries the children out. She leaves the door open.

MARTIN (CONT'D)
Anna. If you're going to do
something, you need to do it fast.
The boy is about to die.

INT. STEVEN'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Anna emerges from the bathroom, wearing her bathrobe. She
lies on the bed next to Steven, revealing parts of her naked
body. She kisses Steven’s hand.

ANNA
You do have beautiful hands.

Steven does not react.

ANNA (CONT'D)
Steven, please don’t kill me. Deep
down I know you won’t do that
because you love me, but I’m saying
this now because you’re upset and
might make the wrong decision. If
you have to kill someone, the
logical thing, no matter how harsh
this may sound, is to kill a child.
Because we can have another child.
I still can and so can you. And if
you can’t, we can try IVF. But I’m
sure we can.

Steven says nothing. He switches off the bedside lamp.
STEVEN
Go to sleep.
INT. STEVEN’S HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT
Martin is lying in a corner of the basement. The key turns in

the lock. The door opens and Kim drags herself into the room
on all fours.
100

101

102

81.

KIM
They’re all asleep. We can go now
and nobody will notice. All you
have to do is help me walk again.
My legs hurt after all this time
and I feel weak. But it’s okay, it
doesn’t matter. I knew at some
point this would all be over and
you would come.

Martin looks at Kim, but doesn’t say anything.

KIM (CONT'D)
I thought we could take your
friend’s motorbike and go away
together. But you have to make me
well first. Okay? I’1l untie you if
you promise I'll get better and we
can run away. Okay?

Martin continues to stare at her in silence. Kim tries to
stand up, but can’t.

KIM (CONT'D)

It’s not working. I still can’t

walk. You have to try harder.
Martin turns his gaze away from Kim.

KIM (CONT'D)

Martin, I’m talking to you. Are you

deaf? I’m telling you, you have to

try harder.
Kim grabs at whatever is in reach and starts throwing random
objects at Martin.
INT. STEVEN'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
The noise wakes Steven up. He turns on the light and gets out
of bed. He rushes out of the bedroom.
INT. STEVEN’S HOUSE - KIM’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Steven comes in to check on Kim. Her bed is empty. She has
removed her feeding tube. Her mobile phone is on the desk.
Bob is asleep in the other bed.

INT. STEVEN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Steven and Anna search for Kim all over the house, both
indoors and outdoors.
103

104

105

82.

INT. STEVEN'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT

Steven notices the basement door is open. He goes into the
basement and looks around. He goes over to Martin and hits
him.

STEVEN
Where is she?

MARTIN
She’s gone.

STEVEN
Where is she? What did you do to
her?

MARTIN
I didn’t touch her. I don’t know
where she is.

Steven runs out of the room.

EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

Anna is driving very slowly along the road. Steven walks in
front of the car. The high beam headlights illuminate the
road. They scan the street for any sign of Kim. Steven is
anxious, out of breath. He glistens with sweat. They find Kim
dragging herself along the pavement. She tries to cross the
road. Her hands and knees are covered with blood.

INT. STEVEN'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Steven is treating his daughter’s wounds. He puts
disinfectant on her cuts. He sews up a gash on her knee.
Anna, standing beside him, passes Steven the medical
instruments.

KIM
I’m sorry for what I did tonight. I
don’t know what came over me, I
don’t know what I was thinking. I
was only thinking about myself,
noone else. That was wrong of me. I
was frightened. Terrified. I
shouldn’t have been. Let me be the
one who atones for your sins, Dad.
Kill me right here, in front of
your eyes so you can be sure that I
die, in case some fate spares me at
the last moment. Kill me right here
in front of you and give me the
ultimate joy of saving my own
mother and my beloved brother from
certain death.

(MORE )
83.

KIM (CONT'D)
A joy that may take the form of
death but has none of death’s
bitterness, of its chill or
darkness. Please Dad, take these
scissors and do me the honour. Mum,
tell him. Dad, please. I would do
anything for you, I would even die
for you. And I’m ready to prove it.
You gave me life and you, only you
have the right to take my life
away. That makes perfect sense. You
are my lords, my masters and I am
just someone who lives to obey your
wishes. I love you so much, don’t
forget that. Remember that when I’m
in my grave, unable to tell you
that I love you. I love you more
than anything in the world, you and
my brother.

Steven finishes dressing his daughter’s wounds. He kisses her
almost on the mouth and caresses her. Anna leaves the room,
taking the bloodied gauzes and cotton wool with her.

106 INT. STEVEN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN —- MORNING

Anna is sitting in a chair. In front of her is a glass of
water. She takes a sip and then puts the glass back on the
table. Classical music plays from a radio on the kitchen
counter. Steven walks into the room.

ANNA
Where have you been?

STEVEN
I went to the hospital. I got the
feeding formula. Have you checked
on him? Did you give him the
sedatives?

ANNA
I let him go.

STEVEN
What are you talking about?

ANNA
He’s not downstairs. I let him go.

STEVEN
Why would you do that?

He hits Anna around the head.
STEVEN (CONT'D)

Why did you let him go? Tell me.
Are you a complete idiot?

Anna walks away. The dog follows her. She stops and turns to
face Steven.

ANNA
It wouldn’t have made any
difference, Steven. It wasn’t going
to solve anything. We both know
that.

INT. STEVEN'S HOUSE - CHILDREN’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Anna sits on the edge of Bob’s bed. She has a washbowl next
to her and cleans Bob’s limbs with a cloth. She has her back
to Kim, who is sitting on her wheelchair beside the bed. Kim
is holding her drip. She starts reciting the phrases that her
mother has taught her to say when she answers the phone at
the clinic.

KIM
Please describe your symptoms. I
see. Would you be so kind as to
hold the line while I check the
doctor's availability? Yes, sorry
to keep you waiting. The earliest
the doctor can see you is next
Thursday. Are mornings or evenings
more convenient for you? Mornings
are better, I see. Next Thursday at
eleven then. We’ll be expecting
you. Good day. (Pause). Anna Murphy
Eye Clinic, how may I help you?

ANNA
Kim, I’m trying to rest. Can you
please be quiet?

KIM
Mum, do you remember when I was
rude to you at the hospital that
day?

ANNA
Yes.

KIM
Did you tell Dad about it?

ANNA
Of course I told him, Kim.

KIM
I didn’t mean it, Mum. Maybe it was
a side effect of the drugs or
something.

ANNA
Kim, please. I’m trying to rest.

KIM
Do your legs hurt? Do they feel
numb? Does your back hurt? Has it
started?

Anna gets up and slaps Kim. She wheels her out of the bedroom
and closes the door.

INT. STEVEN'S HOUSE - BEDROOM — MORNING

Anna is asleep. Steven is sitting on the edge of the bed. He
stares at the wardrobe for a long time. Then he gets up and
goes over to his wife. He stands over her. He looks at her.
His gaze is fixed on her. Wondering whether he should kill
her or not, whether she should give her life to save the
children or not. He takes a step backwards. He looks at her
for a few more moments.

INT. STEVEN’S HOUSE - CHILDREN’S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON
Bob is listening to music on his MP3 player. His eyes start
to bleed. Blood trickles down onto the pillow. Bob wipes the
blood from his face. We hear his sister’s voice, but we
cannot see her.
KIM

Dad, quick! Bob’s dying.

INT. STEVEN’S HOUSE - CHILDREN’S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON

Bob is lying on his bed. Steven wipes the blood from his face
and removes the blood-stained pillow case.

BOB
Dad, who’s your best friend?
STEVEN
I don’t know, Bob.
BOB
Is it Matthew?
STEVEN
Yes, Matthew is a very good friend
of mine.
BOB

I have three. Two boys and a girl
from my class.

STEVEN
That’s great, Bob. It’s good to
have lots of friends.
86.

BOB
I think Mum considers Matthew a
very good friend too.

STEVEN
Yes, that’s right.

BOB
He used to call Mum a lot. Once he
called the house and I picked up
and he said: “I'd like to speak to
Anna, please.” I recognised his
voice, but I didn’t say: “Hi,
Matthew”. I just said: “She’s not
here right now, can I take a
message?” He came over to the house
one time too when you and Kim were
out, so I guess you wouldn’t
remember.

INT. STEVEN'S HOUSE - KIM’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Steven undresses Kim. He then dresses her up in the outfit
she had chosen to wear to Claire’s party. Lying in bed,
unable to help with this awkward procedure, Kim avoids her
father’s gaze. Bob is already dressed up. He sits in his
wheelchair, watching them.

INT. STEVEN'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
Steven enters the bedroom. Anna is frantically making their

bed. She doesn’t seem to notice him. Steven approaches Anna
and stands in front of her. She stops startled.

STEVEN
Bob is bleeding. Come to the living
room.

ANNA
Now?

STEVEN
Yes. Now.

ANNA
Steven?

STEVEN
Yes?

ANNA

Where are the children?

STEVEN
They're already there.

87.

ANNA
I think I’1l wear that black dress
you like.

STEVEN

Wear whatever you like. Just hurry.

Steven leaves the room.

INT. STEVEN'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Kim is sitting in a chair in a corner of the room. Anna is
standing by the wall, near the French windows. Bob is on the
sofa. He can barely sit up. They all look terrified. Their
feet are tied with rope and their mouths are taped.

Steven is standing in the middle of the room. He looks at
each of them in turn. They form a triangle around him. He
puts on a black balaclava that covers his entire face, so
that he can’t see anything. He raises the rifle.

Steven starts spinning round on the spot. He fires a shot. He
stops. Silence. The other three are trying to not make a
sound. They struggle to stifle their instinctive reactions.
He hasn’t hit anyone. The bullet has lodged itself ina
cabinet full of crystal tableware.

Steven starts spinning around again. He fires another shot.
Anna screams. Steven pulls off the balaclava. He sees Bob,
hit in the chest. Motionless. Blood is splattered across the
couch. Kim stares, frozen. Steven puts down his rifle.

INT. BURGER KING - DAY

Steven is sitting in a Burger King with Anna and Kim. Martin
walks in, limping from the bullet wound. He stares at them as
he walks past and sits at a table nearby. Steven and Anna
watch Martin out of the corner of their eye. They both look
haggard. Kim puts ketchup on her chips and starts wolfing
them down. She looks healthy. Her parents watch her eat. When
Kim has finished eating her chips, they put on their jackets
and go to leave. Kim stands up, takes a quick look at Martin
and then follows her parents. She is walking normally.
