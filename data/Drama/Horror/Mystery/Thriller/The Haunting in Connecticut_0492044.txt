Why do bad things happen to good
people?

FADE IN:

INT. CAMPBELL HOME - UPSTATE NEW YORK - DAY 2

The dim light and anonymously silhouetted angle of a
documentary interview. We can barely see the woman we will
come to know as SARA CAMPBELL.

SARA
That’s the real question, right?
Why us? That’s what everybody wants
to know. Some pity us. Others seem
to think I wanted all this -
She sweeps her hand over the table in front of her - reveal a
spread of tabloids and magazines with lurid headlines:
‘Haunting in Connecticut!’ ‘Trapped in the House of the
Dead!’ ‘The REAL Hell House’ etc.

SARA (CONT'D)
God knows why - attention I
suppose. Are they kidding? Truth
is, I don’t know why it happened to
us. We’re just regular people, like
any other family. Not especially
good enough to be worth testing the
way the Lord tested Job. Or wicked
enough to deserve what happened.
Nobody deserves that.

She falls into silence. Then - hearing an off-mike question:

SARA (CONT'D)
A silver lining? I guess...I guess
it did make me more certain that
Heaven exists.

(straight into camera)

It must - right? I mean - maybe
that’s the one good thing...
about glimpsing Hell...

CUT TO:

A RED SWEATY FACE

Burning with a feverish sweat, a teenage boy leans against a
car window, spattered with rain.

SUPER: JUNE 19, 1987

WE ARE:

INT. SARA’S CAR - NIGHT - ON A CONNECTICUT HIGHWAY 3

A worried woman drives at night: SARA CAMPBELL, 38. In the
back seat her son MATT, 16, though the cancer and the
treatment conspire to make him seem much older. She looks at
him in the rear view mirror: Lying in the backseat. Sleeping.

Close on her: A mother’s worry. Eyes try to focus on the
road - while images mix and melt with rain on the windshield:

RAPID IMAGES: 4

X-rays. MRI. body scan. PET Scan. CAT scan. Not whole scenes -
just close-ups and details: Medical graphics. Tight close-ups
in claustrophobic machine interiors. Needles draw blood.

Blood cells seen through a microscope. The works. The
diagnostic hell that brought them here.

DOCTORS AND THEIR AUTHORITATIVE VOICES ALL MERGE:
VARIOUS DOCTORS
Six months maybe less. /Experimental
treatment./No guarantee./Waiting

lists./Nothing in New York. Can you
get to Connecticut?

BACK TO THE PRESENT ON THE INTERSTATE: 5

The car passes a sign announcing that we have just left
Connecticut and entered New York.

IN THE CAR: 3B
As we come back to her face we barely hear her hushed prayer.

SARA
Please God. Let it work. Please.

Matt suddenly sits up behind her.

MATT
Talking to yourself? You know what
they say, first sign of losing it.

SARA
I wasn’t talking to myself. I was
talking to God.

MATT
I think that’s the second.

SARA
I thanked him for giving me you.

MATT
Pull over Mom. I’m gonna be sick.

SARA
Very funny.
MATT
It’s the chemo. I’m really gonna be-

She pulls over - he throws open the back door - we hear but
don’t see him RETCHING. She turns instinctively to help -

MATT (0.S.) (CONT’D)
Mom - don’t look. I’m OK.

She winces with every retch. Matt comes back in.

SARA
Feel better?

He nods. She knows he’s lying as she starts the car moving.

INT. CAMPBELL HOME - UPSTATE NEW YORK - THE KITCHEN - DAY 6

Sara makes breakfast as her husband PETER, 40, walks in from
the bedroom, plastering an unruly boyish cowlick which belies
the strain and age in his eyes. He’s off to work.

PETER
Morning, babe. I didn’t hear you
come in. When did you get home?

SARA
About 4.

PETER
I know it’s two hundred miles, but
how did that take you eight hours?

SARA
Do you really want to know how many
times we stopped so he could vomit?

PETER
Oh, man. How is he now?

SARA
He’s okay now. He’s asleep.

PETER
Lemme get breakfast. You go to bed.

SARA
No it’s alright - I’m still wired
from driving - and Wendy’s helping.

WENDY - Sara's 17 year old niece - enters trailing the
RAUCOUS SOUNDS OF KIDS behind her.
SARA (CONT'D)
Thanks, Wendy. Sorry for the chaos.

WENDY
It’s better than my house.

SARA
My sister loves your daddy - they
just have funny ways of showing it.

WENDY
I knew love was a four letter word,
just not those four letter words.

SARA
Take these pancakes in to the
hungry hordes.

Wendy exits. And through the open door we catch a quick
glimpse of two younger kids at the table. And a bleary and
pale faced Matt stumbling out of a bedroom.

PETER
It’s not good. One of these nights
you’re gonna drive off the road
you'll be so tired.

SARA
I wish we could just move there.
Just for the summer, until -

Behind them we see Matt and Wendy opening the kitchen door -

PETER
And in the meantime what? Pay
mortgage and a rent? Every penny we
got is in the damn store. When we
bought the franchise we didn’t plan-

SARA
Nobody plans to have a child get
cancer.

PETER

You know that’s not what I meant.

See behind them: Matt and Wendy exchange embarrassed glances
and step back - not wanting to hear them fight about Matt.

PETER (CONT'D)
Look. You’re right. He’s gotta come
first. Let’s just do it.

(MORE )
PETER (CONT'D)
Find a rental in Connecticut, near
the Hospital. We’1l make it work.

SARA
You mean it? What’1l you do? How
will we afford it?

PETER
Come on weekends. Take a second
mortgage on our second mortgage.
Whatever it takes.

SARA
We’re gonna make it through this,
right?

PETER
Definitely.

His eyes, though, have none of the certainty of his words.

EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY
Victorian Gothic Hospital with concrete ‘70’s additions.

SUPER: St. Michael's Hospital. Goatswood, Connecticut.
June 20. 10:00 A.M.

INT. ANTECHAMBER - CONTINUOUS
Sara with the Oncologist, DR. Brooks.

DR. BROOKS
He’s doing great.

SARA
He vomited twice more this morning.
That’s doing great?

DR. BROOKS
That’s doing chemo. It’s his
stomach cells dying. And being
reborn. Right now - we’re waging
war. Total war. Inside Matt’s body.
And the battle is just beginning.

SARA
That’s what I’m afraid of.

MONTAGE: - INTERCUT

Tight shots of Matt’s treatment with Sara’s house search:

9c

Sara’s hand circling house-to-rent wants ads; some say “no
kids or no pets” then crossing them out; seeing a few of the
available places through her eyes: they’re dumps;

SARA (0.S.)
They’re all too small, too pricey
or have roaches as big as rats.

Matt strapped down on a tilted gurney beneath a forbidding 9
piece of equipment covered with radioactive warning signs.

SARA (0.S.)
- But I’m not giving up.

INT. THE CAR - LATER 10

After more scratched off lists, Sara is near tears. She looks
out the window and sees it’s the cemetery she’s passing. She
turns away and rams her foot down on the gas as if she could
out run the grim reaper - or at least her tears.

Gloved hands place a fitted mask to hold Matt’s head in 9B
position. Metal rods and leather straps keep his body
immobilized. With a mechanical WHIR the radiation commences.

INT. SARA'S CAR - SAME TIME 10B

Just past the edge of the cemetery she does a double-take and
slows down as she glimpses out of the side of her vision: A
man clumsily hammers a ‘FOR RENT’ sign into the ground.

EXT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 11

Sara pulls up and rolls down the window. Squinting into the
setting sun she sees a squamous purple Victorian house.

SARA
I don’t want to waste your time.
What are you asking?

The man turns around - AZIZ SINGH, realtor. Warm, persuasive.

MR. SINGH
Hello. Welcome. I give you first
month free if I don’t have to
finish hammering this darn sign!

Close Shots: Needles, needles, needles. In Matt’s veins. 9c
Spine. The back of his neck. Drawing blood. Drawing marrow.
Injecting things. Until he’s a pincushion of pain.

MR. SINGH (0.S.)
It just needs some love and care...

INT. HOUSE - SAME TIME 12

Singh guides Sara past the time-faded wallpaper and chipped
paint of a once elegant old interior.

MR. SINGH
---and a good family to bring it
back to life.

SARA
And you don’t mind children?

MR. SINGH
Where would we be without them? On
a cold empty rock.

Suddenly - a RUMBLING, GROANING CLANKING sound.

MR. SINGH (CONT’D)
Old houses are like old stomachs.
They make a lot of noise.

SARA
It’s everything we need. And then
some. It’s beautiful, spacious,
affordable. I mean, it’s too good
to be true. So what’s the catch?

Matt seems to be hanging upside down - as hot lava flows irfttp
his veins - he slowly rotates - But in fact he is not moving -

MR. SINGH (0.S.)
The catch? Yes, well it does have a
somewhat peculiar history...

- it’s the camera spinning: Matt’s in a chair attached to a
machine; tubes from the machine give multiple injections
simultaneously. While another filters his blood.
INT. PHONE BOOTH - LATE AFTERNOON 13
Sara nearly at the end of her rope, talking to Peter.

SARA

I saw one that was almost perfect
but...it just wasn’t quite right.
14 INT. SARA’S CAR - A BEAT LATER 14
Driving home. She looks at Matt in the rear view mirror.

SARA
They say you might have some body
ache - but no nausea.

MATT
(through clenched teeth)
Doctor says to patient; I got bad
news. You’ve got cancer. And you’ve
got Alzheimer’s.’ Patient says
‘Whew, least I don’t have cancer.’

Sara laughs not to cry. As each tiny bump sends paroxysms of
pain through Matt’s body.

MATT (CONT’D)
At least I don’t have nausea.

He’s putting on a brave face - but his groans can’t be
stifled. Every small bump in the road sends shockwaves of
pain through his young body. Sara steals glances in the rear
view mirror at him - and it tears at her heart. She turns the
car around and heads back the way they came...

15 EXT. THE HOUSE - LATER 15

Mr. Singh stands out front with Sara, near her car. We see
he’s brought a big mattress, two sleeping bags, a portable TV
and even some take-away food.

Both of them helping a frail Matt out of the back seat of
the car, one putting a blanket around his shoulders.

SARA
I don’t know how to thank you.

He leans in to her - out of Matt’s hearing.
MR. SINGH
Really, don’t worry - and remember -
a house is just bricks and wood and
plaster. That’s all. Anything else -
is just imagination...

16 INT. HOUSE - LATER 16

Two sleeping bags lie on the mattress beside the table.
17

10.

Matt, half asleep, watches TV. Behind him we see Sara on the
phone.

SARA
I made a decision. You weren’t
there.
She pulls the phone into the next room - so Matt can’t hear.

As Matt nods off we MOVE IN on the TV screen. In reflection
we can see Matt in front of it- but also - something else:

Someone standing behind him. Or is it just the flickering
ghosts of bad TV reception?

Sara steps into the next room - so Matt doesn’t hear.
SARA
You didn’t have to hear him

groaning, Peter. I just couldn’t
take it.

INT. PARLOR - LATER THAT NIGHT 17
Looking down on Sara and Matt. Each in their own sleeping
bag. But lying close. The dark room seems filled with muffled

voices. The walls seem to whisper like faint swarms of bees.

A close POV of the sleeping mother and son - as of someone
standing right over them...

Matt stirs, looks up uneasily at the spot where a second ago
it seemed someone was standing observing them. Nothing there.

Matt slips out of bed as quietly as he can. He starts into
the nearest bathroom - but realizes the sound will wake her -
so he goes looking for another one upstairs.

INT. SECOND FLOOR - CONTINUOUS 18

He finds a bathroom. He leans over to retch. Splashes cold
water in his face. Then freezes. Did he hear something?

VOICE (0.S.)
Matthew.

MATT
Mom?

He opens the door. No one’s there. He pads back downstairs.
19

11.

INT. PARLOR —- CONTINUOUS 19

But he sees she’s still sound asleep. He’s about to get into
his sleeping bag when again he hears--

VOICE (0.S.)
Matthew...

From behind him this time. He tries to follow the sound.

INT. THE BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS 20

He steps into the darkened stairwell. Suddenly the silence is
torn by a GRINDING sound - from deep inside the house: the
clanging of old elevator chains...

Stepping out of the darkness of the stairs, Matt thinks he
sees a mirror - but then sees it is a half wood, half thick
glass wall with a door. The mirror effect is because someone
seems to be standing on the other side of the glass.

 

He approaches - closer - cups his hands to try and see
through the distorting glass -

MATT
Hello? Who’s there?

Seen through the distorting glass: A face - impossible to say
if it is just a distorted reflection of his own face in the
thick glass or another face on the other side looking back at
him - blackened and burnt and mouth open in a scream as a
hand jerks the head away by the hair -

MATCH CUT TO:

INT. PARLOR - MORNING 21

- and it is Matt who SCREAMS as he jerks awake, woozy, his
face red and covered in sweat.

MATT
What? Wh-where?

Sunlight pours in. A hand strokes his brow.

SARA
Honey? You alright?

MATT
Yeah. Just a dream. I guess.
22

25

12.

INT. KITCHEN - MORNING 22
She gives him a can of protein shake.

SARA
Pick of the house for any bedroom
you want: if you drink this. Deal?

Matt tries his best to get some of the protein shake down.

INT. SECOND FLOOR - LATER 23

Matt starts upstairs, checking out the rooms.

INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 24

Matt steps into the first room. Faded Victorian wall paper
covered with an intricate pattern of caged song birds. The
feeling is utterly lonely, and a place out of time.

INT. DOWNSTAIRS PARLOR —- CONTINUOUS 25

Sara’s in the front parlor, damp dusting down the room and
cabinets. She pulls at old built-in wooden cabinets beneath
the windows. They’re stuck shut from years of warping and
dust. She pulls harder - and the wooden door opens, revealing
a cabinet filled with small frames stacked on their sides.

She pulls one out - then another - they’re old framed photos -
from the teens or twenties by the dress of the people - we
recognize the photos - we saw them in the credit sequence:

- Twin boys sit one each on Mother and Father’s lap. The
children seem stiff and awkward as dolls.

- an old man in a bed - surrounded by family who all stare
into the camera - only his eyes are closed.

- a mother and new born infant lie together as if sleeping.

- a family - Mother, Father, Three children. All sit frozen
before a painted backdrop of clouds as if seated in Heaven.

Suddenly Sara recognizes what they are - DEAD PEOPLE. Then
looks around her and recognizes the room she’s standing in -
is the same as the room in which the photos were taken -she
can make out the faded painted over clouds of the heavenly
backdrop still visible beneath the fading paint on the walls,
and drops the photos on the floor, breaking the glass.
26

13.

EXT. BACKYARD - A BEAT LATER 26
Sara bends over the large garbage cans out back dumping the

photos into the garbage cans. Looking around back at the
house to make sure Matt hasn’t seen her.

INT. HALLWAY - DAY 27
In the hall Matt stops by small metal doors with a button. He
opens the doors into a small elevator shaft covered inside
with what looks like centuries of dust. He peers down into
the blackness. He pulls a penny from his pocket and drops it

down the shaft. We hear it PINGING and KNOCKING all the way
down...suddenly a GRINDING of GEARS and CLANKING CHAINS.

INT. DOWNSTAIRS - CONTINUOUS 28

Stepping into the kitchen Sara hears the grinding elevator.

SARA
Matt?

She walks to the stairs and peers up to the hallway.

SARA (CONT'D)
Matt? Did you pick a room?

MATT (0.S.)
Yeah. I did.

The voice doesn’t come from upstairs. But from downstairs.

INT. BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS 29
Sara finds Matt in the middle of the basement.

MATT
Or it picked me.

SARA
What do you mean, it picked you?

MATT
I dunno. It’s the meds mom.

SARA
So, which room?
(Matt gestures, this room)
Down here?
30

31

14.

MATT
I like it. It’s nice and cool. And
best of all, my own private toilet -
nobody has to hear me.

SARA
You don’t need to hide from us.

MATT
Knowing everyone can hear me puking
just makes me feel worse. Alright?

Matt tries the locked door in the half-glass wall that
divides the space. The door is not locked. And the knob

turns. But it just won’t open.

MATT (CONT’D)
What do you think’s back here?

They both have their faces pressed against the glass trying
to see in. HONKS and SHOUTS from upstairs startle them.

PETER (0.S.)
Hello? Anybody home?

INT. THE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 30

Matt's brother BILLY, 11, and sister Mary, 7, race upstairs
arguing over bedrooms. Wendy follows them, giving chase.

WENDY
You wait until Aunt Sara and Uncle
Peter tell you where your room is.
Wait! You little monsters!

EXT. THE HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER 31
Matt and his Dad behind the rented U-Haul, which is connected

to a shiny late model pickup truck - Peter’s pride and joy.
Peter’s pulling boxes out of the back.

MATT
Hand me that one.
PETER
No, no —
MATT PETER

I can - You might -
32

33

34

15.

MATT
Dad, I’m not gonna croak from
carrying cushions.

PETER
That’s not what I meant. You might
scratch my truck.

They laugh. Peter lifts a chair onto his head and walks
inside. Matt follows carrying couch cushions.
BACK UPSTAIRS: 32
Sara leads Wendy into a room down the hall.
SARA

Now I think this room would be a

perfect girl’s room.
INT. BEDROOM —- CONTINUOUS 33
The room with the caged birds on the wall.

WENDY
Why do you say that?

SARA
Good light. Nice wall paper. And a
big mirror.

They both laugh, and as she closes the closet door with the
mirror on it we see SUPER-BRIEF FLASH: A young man - wearing
very old fashioned clothes - stands staring sullenly at them.

 

INT. MATT’S BEDROOM - LATER 34
Peter finishes putting Matt’s bed together down there.

PETER
A little dark. But hey - I was a
teenager once. Cool bachelor pad.

MATT
Cool pad? Dad, this is the 80's?

PETER
Trust me - the 70’s will be back.
(Tries the door)
What’s back here?
35

16.

MATT
Don’t know. We couldn’t open it.

PETER
Hmm. Lock works fine. Knob turns.
Just must be stuck. Step back -

He really leans into it. Nope. Just won’t open.

PETER (CONT'D)
Maybe the owners sealed it for
storage. Or the house settled and
the door frame’s jammed.

They’re interrupted by Sara who walks in with mop and bucket.
SARA
If you’re gonna live down here - I
need to give it a good wash. You
know your immune system is weak. I
don’t like all this dust. Out, out!

Matt and Peter know better than to argue so they leave.

INT. THE BASEMENT —- SOME TIME LATER 35

Sara mops the floor of the room. As she moves backwards, the
glass wall is behind her.

Matt comes down stairs - sees his Mom still cleaning and
smiles and shakes his head - but then he sees:

Behind her it seems he sees two figures back there. One a

tall thin man. The other, a boy - about Matt's age. The same

sullen boy we glimpsed in the mirror upstairs. They are bent

over tables. Working.

Matt says nothing but takes a step closer and for a second we
FLASH TO:

In this exact same space a body'S exsanguinated, drained of

blood. The tall thin man and the boy are embalming a body.

Hosing the blood into a concave ditch that ends in a drain.

BACK IN THE PRESENT

Matt stifles a scream - his mother hears him and looks up
from her mopping with a smile -

SARA
Honey? You feeling alright?
36

17.

Matt looks up - the morticians are gone. He looks down at the
floor and sees a horrific red mess of congealing blood all

around her mop.

Noticing nothing Sara lifts the mop back into the water -
squeezes it out - clear water pours out. Matt blinks and sees
it’s all normal. But when she puts the mop back down on the
floor: again the water turns a thick coagulated red.

MATT
Mom!

She stops and looks up again - a bit annoyed now but trying
not to show it.

SARA
What now?

He looks at the dripping mop - no blood, just water. All
normal. And behind the window no figures leaning over
cadavers. The floor is spotless.

MATT
Um, nothing - just, thanks - for
cleaning my room.

She gives him a peck on the cheek on her way out of the room.
Matt lingers in the door for a second - looking back at his
room - daring it to show him something again.

EXT. BACKYARD - EVENING 36

Tending a barbecue grill, turns to look at Matt - who’s
looking up at the just appearing stars in the night sky.

Peter sees something in Matt’s face. Something vulnerable.
Fearful. Angry? He can’t tell. Maybe all three.

PETER
I remember when we used to go
camping. When you were little. And
every night you’d fall asleep
counting the stars and could never
finish. Used to drive you nuts.

Matt just stares at him. He’s a long way from that kid now.

MATT
Yeah. But then I learned. All the
stars we see are already dead. We
just haven’t gotten the news.
37

38

18.

Peter, worried, has no reply to that as Matt turns and walks
into the house. Passing Sara, who is coming out with burger
buns. Sara saw the worried look on Matt’s face, and it is
mirrored in her own worried expression.

PETER
Something on your mind?

SARA
Of course there’s something on my
mind. There’s always something on
my mind. The same as always.

INT. MARY’S ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT 37
Mary and Wendy are kneeling by the bed -

WENDY
You get your own room - like a big
girl- you sure you won’t be scared?

MARY
I don’t think so.

WENDY
Good. Okay, you start.

MARY
Now I lay me down to sleep -

As we hear the prayer we PAN ACROSS the shelf above her bed -
lined with all her stuffed animals and dolls: including her
favorite, a featureless soft thing, worn to almost nothing,
impossible to say whether it was once a teddy-bear or rabbit
or what. Its remaining shoe-button eye hangs by a string.

MARY O.S.
If I should die before I wake...

We continue out down the hall to the next room where -

INT. BILLY'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS 38

MARY O.S.
I pray the Lord my soul to take.

Billy’s a bit spooked. He closes his door most of the way.
He looks in the closet. Then checks under the bed too.
39

40

19.

EXT. THE HOUSE - THAT NIGHT 39

On this moonless night the darkened house looms like a
shadow’s shadow. Darker than the night itself.

INT. MATT’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 40

Matt in bed, face covered in sweat. His closed eyes twitch
from the force of rapid eye movement. Suddenly he sits
upright in bed. Eyes still closed. Then they snap open.

But blank and unseeing - staring not merely across the room —
but across decades of time past into the glassed in room.

MATT’S POV:

In the next chamber he sees a tall thin man - the one he
earlier saw embalming a body - AICKMAN - who now seems bent
over some writing on pale parchment.

Beyond him the boy, JONAH - watches Aickman writing with a
look of growing horror - then looks up across the space and

locks eyes with Matt -

And suddenly it is as if Matt can see through Jonah's eyes -
a_close vision of Aickman's strange writing:

Aliguem Mortuum Suspiria

Magical words and symbols fill the screen. Thin scratchings
in red on parchment. Arcane words in an ancient languages of
necromancy. And as we see them, we hear them:

AICKMAN (0.S.)
Aliquem mortuum suspiria, talis
ordo tenebrum est.

And suddenly we widen to see: Aickman is not writing on
parchment - he is not writing at all - he is carving these
letters with a thin scalpel directly into the pale flesh of

an_ embalmed corpse!

AICKMAN (CONT'D)
.---per nomina sancta deus...Adonai,
Alpha et Omega, Sabaoth...

See now scores of incantations carved upon every inch of the
dead white flesh by the thin grey hands of Aickman

Behind him, we glimpse several other bodies bound in cloth -
and from arms and ankles sticking out we can see: They too

are carved with signs and words.
41

42

43

20.

The boy - JONAH - stares horrified - his face a mirror to
Matt's face across the room staring blindly at the strange
things happening right in his bedroom!

And now we understand the shocked look of abject horror in
the eyes of the boy Jonah who sees:

E.C.U:

As Aickman's long fingers pull gently on the corpse's eyelid -

 

stretching the delicate flesh out from the head. And with a
horrible SNIPPING sound -

 

WE CUT TO:

INT. MATT’S BEDROOM —- CONTINUOUS 4l

Matt’s own eyes, for the first time, blink. And he is
suddenly awake. He looks around - disoriented. As if it were
all just some horrific, and horrifically detailed, nightmare.

He looks across the room - to the half glass divider - behind
which he saw - or dreamt he saw - such abominable things.

Matt wipes the sleep from his eye and gets closer to the
window - he sees nothing. He tries the door knob.

MATT
ow!

He pulls his hand back. And we can see his skin blistering -
as if he had grabbed burning metal.

 

EXT. THE HOUSE - MORNING 42

From the back yard, looking at the kitchen windows. In the
bright summer sun the place looks almost homey.

Super: July 20th 8:30 am

INT. KITCHEN - MORNING 43

Sara’s making breakfast. Matt’s there too, taking plates from
a cupboard and putting them on the counter. Then he gets out
silverware and carries it back to the dining room.

As he starts to set the knives and forks around the table, he
hears, faint but distinctly, VOICES. He can’t tell at first.
21.

From the walls? The ceiling? Or is it the floor? Or all of
them? He turns around, no one’s there.

Shaking it out of his mind, Matt walks back to the kitchen -
only to find the plates he set out on the counter are gone -
and they’re back in the cupboard where he got them. Sara is
at the stove, tending to the eggs and pancakes.

MATT

Why'd you put the plates back?
SARA

What?
MATT

I put the plates out and now --

SARA
I didn’t touch them, sweetie.
Are you okay?

Matt nods, then steps back to the cupboard. CRASH! He spins,
the plates are on the floor, broken. Sara hurries over. She
also notes for the first time his hand - it looks burned.

SARA (CONT'D)
I’m sorry honey. That was stupid of
me. The dishes were too heavy for-

MATT
I didn’t drop them.
SARA
Then how -
MATT

I don’t know! I swear - I - saw -
Sara touches his forehead, checking for fever.

SARA
Dr. Brooks said to tell him if you
were seeing things. He said -

MATT
- I remember what he said. He said
if I was seeing things - or even
thinking weird things - it meant
they'd drop me from the trial. We
didn’t come this far, turn our
lives upside down, move house, just
to call it all off.
44

22.

SARA
But if you’re -

MATT
No Mom. It’s nothing. I’m not
seeing things. I swear. Nothing's
wrong. Really. I’m just tired. I
remember now - I just left them
sitting too close to the edge.

SARA
Well, alright. But you tell me if
anything like that happens again.
Promise?

MATT
Promise. Sorry I broke the dishes.

SARA
That’s alright sweetie. Your
Grandmother used to kiss me when I
broke a plate or a glass. Said it
meant something worse won’t happen.

INT. DR. BROOKS’S OFFICE - DAY 44

With Sara and Matt there, the Doctor, wearing latex gloves,
gingerly probes the peeling skin on Matt’s hand.

DR. BROOKS
His skin may well turn black. Start
peeling off. Perfectly normal.
It’s a bit early. But that could be
a good sign.

He pulls a thermometer out of Matt’s mouth.

DR. BROOKS
No fever - excellent. Less nausea?
Good. Even a bit of appetite.
Outstanding. And no visual or
auditory hallucinations or other
behavioral abnormalities?

She’s silent for a beat. The Doctor looks up at her, and at
Matt. Matt looks at her - worried she’s going to mention this
morning...

DR. BROOKS
Anything?

She hesitates for a beat, but only a beat.
45

45A

23.

SARA
No, no. Sorry I was just
distracted. He’s fine, I guess.
Considering.

Matt nods in agreement.

DR. BROOKS
Excellent. Then we can continue to
stage two.
INT. CHEMOTHERAPY ROOM - DAY 45

Matt sits in a room eith six Barcaloungers facing six tele-
visions. Each chair attached to one of the modules which
controls the chemo. Some of the people, all in street
clothes, in the other five chairs have already lost their
hair. Some still look robust. Some will die, and soon.

In the chair next to him a strangely young pair of eyes peer
curiously out of an older man’s face - POPESCU.

Matt hears a SCRABBLING sound and looks down at the floor to
the right of his chair and sees with a jolt: A large black
CRAB scuttles across the floor and scrambles under the chair.

Matt looks around - no one else seems to have noticed. He
leans over and tries to see under the chair. Nothing.

And before he can sit back up a black claw whips out and
closes on the soft part of his forearm -—

 

And he screams -—

NURSE (0.S.)
Now that didn’t hurt.

REVEAL WE ARE:

INT. CHEMOTHERAPY ROOM - DAY 45A

A nurse pulls a needle out of his arm as Matt snaps awake in
the chemo room. The old man, Popescu, lays a reassuring hand
on his arm leans in conspiratorially close:

POPESCU
You were dreaming.

MATT
What? Oh. Yeah.
24.

POPESCU
And breathing heavy. Which of
course can mean either a very bad
dream. Or a very good one. Which
was it?

MATT
I’ve had better.

His eyes seem to look right into Matt - spreading a kind of
warmth as they do.

MATT (CONT’D)
Sometimes lately - It’s been hard.

POPESCU
What?

MATT
To tell which is a dream.

POPESCU
Are we men dreaming we’re
butterflies? Or butterflies
dreaming we’re men?

MATT
Do you ever...
POPESCU
What?
MATT
I dunno, see things? Hear things.
Things that... aren’t - that can’t

be - there?

Popescu makes a zipping gesture at his lips - and turns an
invisible key and tosses it away.

POPESCU
Don’t ever tell them you can see
things. They won’t understand. When
my wife was dying - the whole last
day - I sat there praying and
crying. She never once looked at
me. Just looked all around her - as
if at all the others in the room -
but we were alone. Or so I thought.
Now I know better. She was where we
are. In the valley.
46

47

25.

MATT
The Valley?

POPESCU
Of the shadow of death. And you
know what to do when you find
yourself in the valley of the
shadow of death?

MATT
What?
POPESCU
Easy. Fear no evil.
He hands Matt a card: Fr. Nicholas Popescu.
POPESCU
If you need to talk, call me.
Any time.
INT. HOUSE - NIGHT 46

The children all asleep, Sara’s still awake at a table
covered in bills and insurance forms. She’s on the phone
talking to Peter:

SARA
Right, this was gonna be free.
Sixty bucks for five pills... No,
that they’1ll cover. But not the
follow-ups... The blue one for the
nausea? Yes. But the pink one that
stops him feeling restless because
of the blue one?... I tried, Peter.
I was on hold for an hour!

INT. MATT’S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT 47

Matt lies in bed. Tossing. Groaning. He wakes, raises his
head and searches the room - nothing - or... This is so like
one of his dreams. Is he asleep? He looks down at his arm —
and pinches himself - hard. Awake, he sits up and looks at
the glass wall across the room. Is there a shape in there?

 

Looks harder. Yes. Definitely. Around his size - a bit
smaller - standing just the other side of the glass. The
shadow moves in the other chamber to the door.

Matt looks at the door. It slowly swings open.
48

49

26.

Matt stares into the widening blackness - He stands up -
shaky - and moves towards the door - and into the darkness.
For a moment we see through the glass:

Two figures face each other.

INT. MATT’S BEDROOM - THE NEXT MORNING 48

BILLY (0.S.)
Matt? Where are you? Matt?

Billy comes down the stairs. But the bedroom is empty.

MATT
In here.

Then Billy sees - the open door to the other room.

BILLY
Whoa. How’d you get in there?

And we see it really wasn’t a dream. The door is open.

INT. EMBALMING CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS 49
From Billy’s POV, we get our first good look inside there.

BILLY
What is this place?

MATT
Hop on.

Matt's standing behind a heavy stainless steel gurney -
practically gleaming considering how old it is.

MATT (CONT’D)
Take you for a ride.

Billy gets on. Matt pulls him roughly - so he’s flat on it.
Matt starts turning it around - faster and faster. As he does
- he sees - while spinning around - glimpses of Aickman and
Jonah removing a body from a coffin. The coffin then filled
not with a body, but with sandbags, and re-sealed shut.

He seems oblivious to his brother who’s holding on to the
gurney which Matt is turning faster and faster.

BILLY
Matt - slow down - Matt! Stop!
50

27.

PETER (0.S.)
(Descending the stairs)
Dammit, what is going on down here?

Matt stops. Billy nearly thrown from the gurney.

BILLY
What's the matter with you?

MATT
Sorry.

As their Dad steps into the bedroom and sees the open door.

PETER
I guess I loosened it, eh?
(entering the room)
What the hell...

About three feet from the floor, along all four walls runs
a continuous shelf about three feet in width. In a corner
there’s a dull porcelain embalming TABLE. Pile of old
yellowed TOE TAGS next to a dusty glass EMBALMING PUMP.

Creepy old EMBALMING TOOLS, trochars, big metal syringes
scattered on the shelf. Old rust-stained PORCELAIN SINKS.
Then the clincher: an old bottle labelled formaldehyde.

PETER (0.S.) (CONT’D)
Well now we know why the rent was
so cheap. The question is -

INT. MASTER BEDROOM - LATER 50
Peter bears down on Sara, who’s trying to avoid facing him.

PETER
- what did you know and when the
hell did you know it? Jesus!

SARA
(reacts to his anger)
Know what?

PETER
What this place was. Aren’t you the
one who says we can’t live on lies?

SARA
Yeah. But that was because you were
a drunk. And a liar.
28.

He’d like to return fire but Peter calms himself, accepts it.

PETER
Right. But I’m not now. Thanks to
you. And the children. And that’s
not how we work. Right?

SARA
I know. I’m sorry. I should have
told you. I just - we needed some
place. And it just seemed perfect.
Like a gift from God.

51 EXT. CEMETERY - SUNSET 51

Wendy and Matt on a walk, approaching a foot entrance to the
cemetery near their house. Matt gestures, let’s go in.

WENDY
You sure?

MATT
Yea though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death, I
shall fear no evil. For I am the
baddest mutha in the valley.

They walk in past Victorian mortuary sculptures, blackened
and moss covered. Walk slowly between rows of older Puritan
stone monuments bearing only a simple winged skull and some
even older, rubbed blank by the scouring winds of time.

Matt looks across the cemetery to where a small group in
period attire stand around an open grave where a coffin is
lowered into the ground while the minister says his last and
mourners toss handfuls of dirt.

MINISTER
(far off voice)
“I am the first and the last: I am
he that liveth, and was dead; and
behold, I am alive for evermore,
Amen; and have the keys of hell and
of death..."

Matt turns back to Wendy who bends to smell wild flowers. He
looks back up at the funeral - but there is no funeral. Just
an empty cemetery where he and Wendy are the only - living -
people present. He shudders and rubs his eyes.

WENDY
You alright?
29.

MATT
Yeah. Sure.

They walk past old headstones that look ready to tip over.

MATT
You ever ask yourself, what’s the
point?

WENDY

The point of what?

MATT
Anything. Doing anything. Being
anything. You just end up here
anyway. Why be alive at all?

Matt makes a cynical snort that startles Wendy. Matt suddenly
and viciously kicks a tottering tombstone, knocking it flat.

He’s about to kick another one, to kick them all over if he
can. But Wendy grabs Matt, and holds him.

WENDY
I used to wonder about that. I'd lie
awake at night - just hearing my
parents yelling. Seems like day and
night all they did was curse at each
other. Some nights I thought he’d
kill her. Other times I wished they’d
kill each other. Or me. Just to stop
the hate.

He looks at her - for a brief moment lifted out of his pain.

WENDY (CONT’D)
But then I moved in with you guys.
I realized it didn’t have to be
that way. I don’t know what happens
when we die. If anything happens.
But I know what can happen when
you’re alive. You can love. And be
loved. And every minute you’re one
or the other...

52 INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT 52

At the table, the whole family is sitting down for a meal.

WENDY (0.S.)
-..is a gift.
53

30.

Matt just looks around at his loving family. Wendy’s words
echoing in his ears. There’s a lot of chatter and passing
dishes. Then Peter quiets everybody down.

PETER
Okay, so, everyone knows now this
used to be a funeral home. Big
deal. It’s not anymore, and hasn’t
been for years and years. It’s just
a house. Bricks, nails, wood. And
it’s our house for the rest of the
summer. Until Matt’s finished at
the hospital. We’re all under
pressure and we all have to pull
together, like a team. Okay?

He holds out his hands - and they all join hands. And the
INSTANT they do - it’s as if they have formed some kind of
electrical circuit and_a_ strange current JOLTS Matt -

PETER (CONT'D)
Who wants to say grace? Matt?

They all look at Matt. Who is staring behind them - beyond
them - as if there were others in the room.

SARA
Matt, you alright?

He’s not alright. He’s not even there any more...

HE IS:

INT. PARLOUR - 1927 53

The same parlor where they now sit - but now it is arrayed
for a different sort of ritual. Six people seated around the
circular table, holding hands. Holding a seance.

Aickman, eyes lit with an uncanny fire, stands behind the
circle. Move around the table and see their faces: skeptical,
nervous, mournful, others nearly joyful.

- and at the end of the circle we come to the boy, JONAH...

- in whose pale impassive face only the liquid green eyes
show anything at all: abject dread.

We circle around them faster and faster - Sometimes from in
front of their faces - sometimes from behind their heads -
The candle light throws fantastic shadows - Dizzying us -
with the swaying and the singing - and the movement -
52B

54

31.

Suddenly stop: The table begins to tremble beneath their
fingers - the legs rattling against the floor.

 

 

INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 52B

PETER (0.S.)
Matt!

Angle on Matt who looks up in mirror and sees not himself but
Jonah staring back at him.

PETER (CONT'D)
Matt!

Matt suddenly focuses on them. And sees that of course they
don’t see what he sees. He giggles. Weirdly. It’s that or
scream at the top of his lungs.

PETER (CONT'D)
What's wrong with you?

Matt can’t stop laughing. He’s hysterical. Mary starts to cry
- and Billy staring at his brother on the verge of it -

PETER (CONT'D)
(fiercer)
Matt -

SARA
Peter. Please. It’s the medicine.

Wendy gently steps over to Matt.

MATT
Did you see..?

But he doesn’t finish the sentence - because he can see that
she didn’t - that none of them - saw what he saw.

He just shakes his head sadly and allows himself to be led
out of the room - and downstairs - to his room.

INT. BASEMENT - A BEAT LATER 54
She sits next to him on the bed.

WENDY
What happened up there?

MATT
I - nothing.
32.

WENDY
You seeing things?

MATT
No. I am not seeing things. I can’t
be.

WENDY

What do you mean?

MATT
If I was seeing things - they’d
stop the treatments.

WENDY
So what happened?

He wants to tell her but he can’t, outright. So he tries the
only way he can.

MATT
You remember that book when we were
kids? With the weird pictures? We
used to love that one. “The man who
was not there.”

WENDY
I do. I do remember.

MATT
‘As I was walkin' up the stair/
I saw a man who wasn't there/He
wasn't there again today.’

MATT /WENDY
‘Oh how I wish he'd go away’

They laugh. She looks at him tenderly.

MATT
Remember the other one?

WENDY
No - maybe, which one?

MATT
‘One bright day in the middle of
the night. Two dead boys got up to
fight. Back to back they faced one
another. Drew their swords and shot
each other...
55

33.

He looks over her shoulder - to the glass divider - where
someone else seems to be standing looking back in -

MATT (CONT’D)
‘,..A deaf policeman heard the
noise. He came and killed those two
dead boys.’

He seems even now to be seeing past her - to someplace, or
someone not there...

WENDY
Matt, you’re scaring me.

He turns back to her, his skin going a whiter shade of pale.

MATT
Join the club.

EXT. THE DRIVEWAY - NIGHT 55
Sara holds Peter beside his truck.

PETER
Before he got sick, we were already
in over our heads. Now we're
headin’ for the bottom of the pool.
I’m just sorry you have to work. We
moved out here so you wouldn’t have
to be gone all the time.

SARA
It’s easier than driving him was.
And besides. We need the money.

PETER
We gotta get through the summer.
Then Matt’1l be fine. And business
will pick up before Christmas.

SARA
Do you have to go back tonight?

PETER
If I’m not there to open in the
morning and if we don’t meet the
minimum days open we might as well -

She stops him with a kiss.

SARA
I know. I’m proud of you.
56

57

58

59

34.

PETER
Of me? For what?

SARA

For working so hard. And for

keeping your promises. All of them.
INT. WENDY'S ROOM - NIGHT 56
Wendy is painting her toenails, cottonballs between them.
Slowly, she begins to feel there is a Presence behind her.
But when she turns: no one is there.
INT. TRUCK - ON THE ROAD - LATER 57
Peter drives by a road house. Then stops and pulls over.
Turns around. And pulls in. He sits in the car in front of
the bar. Looks up at the Rolling Rock Beer sign flashing on
and off. His hand reaches for the door - then stops. Instead,

he starts the truck again and pulls back out into the road.

Promises.

INT. THE HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT 58
Sara comes out of her room to go to the kitchen for a glass

of water. We follow Sara down the stairs and around a corner -
where we see a shade lurking -

- Sara rounds the corner - and gasps out loud. But it’s not a
ghost; just Matt standing blankly against the wall in a black
t-shirt and black sweats. He seems somehow barely there.

SARA
What are you doing?

He doesn’t respond. She sees he’s out of it, and just leads
him back to his room.

SARA
Come on, back to bed...
INT. KITCHEN - AFTERNOON 59
The kids, including Wendy, eat lunch.

Super: August lst 12:30 P.M.
60

61

60B

35.

Matt's skin, recently so red, has turned to black scales,
even on his face. He nibbles a sandwich while Wendy rubs a
soothing cream on his neck and arms. Billy and Mary take
turns shaking and checking a silvery “Krystal Ball” (a toy
“oracle”). Through a small window one sees a 20-sided die
with stock answers printed on each side floating in fluid.)

BILLY

Is Mary a total Goon?
“Oh Yes!”

Mary grabs it from him.
MARY
Is Billy a Poop Head?
“But of course, my dear!”
SARA
Okay, cut it out. I gotta go to
work. You have my number. Wendy’s
in charge, so you listen to her!

MATT
If you don’t then you deal with me.

He extends his blackened arms like he was Frankenstein or
some creature from a lagoon. The little ones giggle. Sara,
behind Matt, kisses him on top of the head, looking at Wendy,
both of them relieved for now he’s still the old Matt.

INT. STAIRWELL - LATER 60

Matt covers his eyes and counts...

MATT
56- 57- 58 -

QUICK GLIMPSES: 61
Mary climbs into a cabinet beneath the sink in the kitchen;
Billy squeezes into a storage space at the base of the
stairs; Wendy hides behind the thick parlor curtains.

INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS 60B
Matt finishes -

MATT
59 - 60.

He moves slow and awkwardly - but he’s trying.
62

63

36.

INT. UPSTAIRS - CONTINUOUS 62
He looks down the hallway.

MATT
Ready or not...

Sees a couple of the bedroom doors open - steps up to the
doorway of the first one which is -

INT. WENDY'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 63

- the one with the faded birdcage wall paper. At the edge of
the open door he glimpses a shadow moving inside...

MATT
..-here I come!

Inside the room, for an instant we see the wall paper un-fade
- as Matt pushes open the room expecting to see one of his
siblings or his cousin - but instead sees:

JONAH, gathering meagre belongings - stuffing them into a
pillow case.

Before a speechless Matt can react - Jonah walks right past
him into the hallway!

Matt spins - but there is no one in the hallway - he turns
back to the room - it too is empty - and the wall paper is
once again faded and peeling.

Matt breathes and collects himself. Shakes it off - and tries
to continue the game.

Matt steps back into the hall and sees out of the corner of
his eye: someone moving down the stairs.

MATT
Now I gotcha.

He pads quietly to the stairs and looks down the railing in
time to see: Moving as silently as possible, trying to avoid
every creak of wood, Jonah sneaks down the stairs -

Matt hurries downstairs following him, but when he gets there
- there is no one.
64

65

66

67

37.

INT. DOWNSTAIRS - CONTINUOUS 64

Matt peers into the parlor, through mottled glass. It’s empty
- Then he hears a sound behind him - like a doorknob turning -
he spins back to the hall - towards the front door and sees:

Jonah at the door - his hand on the door knob - slowly
turning, quietly easing the front door open...

Matt’s about to cry out - when he sees a big grey hand slap
the back of Jonah's neck - and another grab him by the hair.
It's the tall thin man, AICKMAN. Jonah twists and struggles
as Aickman drags him back - right past the wide-eyed Matt.

Matt opens his mouth to say something - to scream but no
sound comes out - as he sees the ghostly figures disappear
down the basement stairs...

INT. VARIOUS - CONTINUOUS 65

Each of the others in their hiding places. Trying to hold
their breath and not make a sound.

INT. MATT’S BEDROOM —- CONTINUOUS 66

Matt comes down the basement stairs and sees across his own
room to the other chamber and, for just an instant, sees:

Jonah surrounded by shrouded corpses. Then the door slams
shut on its own, blocking Matt’s view...

The game is forgotten now - Matt races the few steps from the
stairs across his bedroom to the dividing wall door - and
throws it open and sees:

INT. MORTUARY CHAMBER - PAST & PRESENT CONTINUOUS 67

It is not the empty room we’ve seen but the active Embalming
Chamber it once was: Blood stained tools. Buckets of blood -
bottles of reeking fluids. And gurneys with covered corpses.

As he steps into the room - the door slams behind him - he
spins and tries the door - but it’s locked - he can hear
sounds from behind him - but is too terrified to turn around -
he hears the sounds of shrouds slipping from bodies -

Slowly Matt turns around - All the breath slips from his
lungs, the blood drains from his face as he tries to
understand what he sees:
68

67B

69

38.

He is now were Jonah was - trapped - alone - sealed in a room

with the defiled, engraved corpses. All the bodies are
inscribed with the incantations. And worse they seem like
human candles - their features flicker between the states in
which they died - the embalmed look, and their face inscribed
with Aickman’s spindly red handiwork.

Thinking he saw one of the bodies actually move, Matt backs
towards the door, hyperventilating in terror.

UPSTAIRS: 68
The kids run from their hiding places at the sound of Matt
SCREAMING downstairs - They all run to the basement stairs.
INT. EMBALMING CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS 67B
Matt trapped between the pressing dead - their lidless eyes
stare wide - their lipless mouths press at his ears - their

nail-less hands paw at him -

MATT
For God's Sake -

Just as the other three run into the room -

MATT (CONT’D)
- leave me alone!!

But they think he’s yelling at them - since there’s no one
else there.

Billy looks disgusted, while Mary buries her face in Wendy -
who just shakes her head at her cousin.

WENDY
It’s okay. Let’s go.

She sweeps the little ones away with her back upstairs. Matt
looks back: the ghosts are gone, leaving him utterly alone.
INT. KITCHEN - LATER 69

Matt presses the phone to his ear and nervously clutches
something in his hand - Old Fr. Popescu’s card.

MATT
I don’t know who else to talk to.
70

39.

EXT. ST BENEDICT’S/OLD CHURCHYARD - LATE AFTERNOON 70

The last light of day illuminates an old Catholic church-
yard. The church itself is shuttered. And weeds have grown
over the small plot of graves at its edge.

POPESCU (0.S.)
They said there weren’t enough
parishioners to make it worth the
upkeep. But I think they knew I’d
never move to another parish - so
it was the easiest way of putting
me out to pasture.

We find Matt - and the old priest, Popescu, near a large
stone angel whose moss covered eyes seem to weep black tears.

POPESCU
She loved this spot. This angel who
weeps black tears.... After the
cremation I walked around here for
hours - pockets filled with ashes -
sending her back home to the sky.

 

Matt follows the old man’s gaze - up into an impassive grey
sky as if he could see her ashes swirling upward in the wind.

POPESCU (CONT’D)
Tell you a secret. There is no
heaven. No hell. No separate place
way up there or way down there.

MATT
I see why they retired you.

POPESCU
Yes, well. I didn’t stop believing.
Sometimes I think they did. See,
it’s all here. All right here.

MATT
Here?

POPESCU
All around us. All the time. The
living and the dead. But invisible
to every one. Or almost every one.
We’re not like other people
anymore. Most people spend all
their life firmly in this world -
then one day they go straight to
the other side.

(MORE )
71

72

73

40.

POPESCU (CONT'D)
Some of us - we take a more
roundabout path - spend quite a lot
of time in the border land. And who
knows - when you pass this close to
the next world - maybe we see
across the border. Maybe not.
Either way only one thing matters.

MATT
What?

POPESCU
Like I told you: Fear No Evil. Be
fearless. And open.

MATT
Open?

POPESCU
This is your destiny. The light and
the dark. I know it’s not easy.
Have you ever seen a smiling Saint?

Beat.
MATT
So what do I do?
EXT. THE HOUSE - NIGHT 71

The house painted by sickly yellow moonlight.

POPESCU (0.S.)
Find out what he wants from you.

INT. MATT’S BEDROOM —- CONTINUOUS 72

Matt asleep. A candle lit beside him throws a huge shadow on
the wall. But it is not his shadow. Not a shadow at all. It’s
Jonah. It almost looks as if the dead boy were bent over
whispering to a sleeping Matt.

INT. MINI-MART - NIGHT 73

Sara sits behind a glass window at the cash register.
Suddenly A DEMON presses its face against the glass. Sara
SHRIEKS. It’s not a demon but A GUY guy on PCP. Sara shrinks
back as SECURITY appears and ushers the man out of the store.

41.

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT 74
CREAKING of steps. The basement step door opens. MATT steps
up out of the basement stairs - and into the hall. He walks
eyes open but unseeing. Like a sleepwalker.

EXT. THE CONVENIENCE STORE - NIGHT 75

Sara finished the 5 to 1 shift, and is just now driving home.

EXT. THE HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT 76

The house - strangely lit from within by weirdly flickering
light - looks like a lunatic’s grimacing face as Sara pulls
up the drive and slumps exhausted at the wheel.

INT. THE HOUSE - A BEAT LATER 77

She steps quickly but quietly into the house. That strange
flickering light pervades the whole place.

INT. PARLOUR - A BEAT LATER 78

And then she sees why - a roaring fire in the fireplace on
this hot summer night.

That’s not all. Every candle in the house has been found, and
lit - including many along the walls, and dangerously close
to the drapes; some of the drapes are already burning.

And the paint on one wall has begun to blacken and peel
beneath the combined heat of all the candles lined up there.
Sara quickly bats the fire out of the drapes. And then she
smells it. Gas. She follows the smell - to

INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 79

At the threshold of the room - the center of the smell - she
stares:

Matt stands like a statue in the middle of the room - a
candle is burning down to only a few inches - the kitchen is
lit only by the candle held in the stiff hand of her son.

His fist is covered in melted wax - his skin seared - but no
reaction.
42.

Sara blows out the candle, then runs over to the stove - puts
out the burners and turns off the oven. She throws open all
the windows.

SARA
Matt! Matt!? What’s going on in
here?

But no response from Matt.

INT. HOUSE - A BEAT LATER 80

She rushes upstairs to the other kids’ rooms. Wendy already
out of her room, in the hall, she heard the commotion.

SARA
Get the kids - outside - now - NOW!

INT. PARLOR - A BEAT LATER 81

She runs in carrying a bucket of water from the kitchen - she
throws most of it on the drapes, some still smoldering - then
tosses some on the candles everywhere - blows the others out -
all this time Matt still sits unmoving - oblivious to it all.

INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 82

She runs back to the kitchen. Grabs Matt’s hand but he won’t
move. Nothing will rouse him. She slaps him - hard across the
face - Nothing. No reaction. Again. Nothing. Now with all her
strength she slaps him again - and he blinks - and is awake -

EXT. OUTSIDE THE HOUSE - A BEAT LATER 83

The kids are mystified. All talk at once - they have no idea
what happened. Sara stares at Matt. He looks back at her.

SARA
What were you doing?

MATT
I - I don't know. I remember lying
in bed. And next thing I remember
is you slapping me in the kitchen.

SARA
You kids go back to bed. Wendy...

Wendy herds the kids inside. Sara remains looking at Matt.
84

85

43.

SARA (CONT'D)
You could have killed them all. And
yourself. Is that what you’re
trying to do? Kill yourself?

MATT
No, Mom - I swear -

Sara’s about to blow her stack, but when she looks at him he
seems so weak and vulnerable, she holds herself back. He
notices her staring at him, and misinterprets it.

MATT
I know - I look horrible - I-

SARA
No! It’s not that. I could never
care how you look. You’re my son, I
love you. It’s how you’re acting.
All this skulking around - scaring
the others... Talk to me Mattie.
Tell me what’s going on.

He just shakes his head - like she could never understand.
And walks alone back into the house.
INT. SARA’S BEDROOM - LATER - ON THE PHONE WITH PETER 84

She’s fragile, exhausted and on the verge of a fight.

SARA
He could have burned the house
down.
INT. BASEMENT OF NEW YORK HOUSE - SAME TIME 85

Peter’s in the basement at a makeshift office - table covered
in invoices, bills, and threatening collection notices. And
pages of inventory and other work papers.

PETER
You sure you're not...exaggerating?

SARA
You didn’t see it, you weren't
here. As usual.

PETER
What do you want from me!? I can’t
be in two places at once!
84a

86

44,

SARA
(apologetic)
I know. It’s just. Hard.

PETER
Do you want me to talk to him?

INT. SARA AND PETER’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 84A

SARA
No. No. It’s okay. I better go.
This is expensive.

She hangs up the phone and sits there - feeling completely
alone. She opens the small drawer of the bedside table and
pulls out some rosary beads. She begins to pray...

SARA
Our Father, who art in Heaven...

But she stops. Unable to continue the prayer. She closes her
eyes to concentrate. But then just shakes her head, sticks
the rosary back into the drawer. And turns out the light.

EXT. HOUSE - DAY 86

Matt - face blackened, hair patchy - is being helped out of
the minivan by Sara. Looking closer at Matt, as Sara helps
him to the front door, it’s more than hair he’s lost. It
looks like his will to live isn’t there anymore, either.

SARA
Can you just stand here a minute
babe? I left my purse in the car.

MATT
Sure. I’m fine.

He stands at the doorway, swaying a bit. He puts his hand out
to grab the door frame of the house to steady himself -

But instead of finding solid wall his fingers sink into rot
and he pulls a fist full of rancid material from the house -

- he looks down in his hand at a handful of rotted meat with
WHITE MAGGOTS squirming in it.

SARA (0.S.)
Matt?
87

88

89

45.

He looks back at his mother, then down at his hand. It is
empty. The only thing is the blackening and peeling of his
own skin. He looks at the house. Everything looks fine.

EXT. THE HOUSE - EVENING 87

The sun is just setting behind the house. The sky is on fire.

Super: August 10th. 6:30 P.M.

INT. THE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 88
Everyone’s in the kitchen, finishing a quick dinner.

SARA
I wish you’d go with us.

MATT
Hey, I’m alright. I - wasn’t used
to the meds. I’m fine now.

She just looks at him.

MATT
I’m not gonna burn the house down,
alright?

SARA

I know that, honey.

WENDY
You just need to get out more.

MATT
Why?

They all look away - don’t know how to face his bitterness.
Sara impulsively hugs him - fiercely. Matt winces in pain.

SARA
Sorry. I just love you so much.

MATT
Like the man says. Love hurts.
INT. THE BASEMENT - LATER 89

Matt’s listening to Joy Division - Love Will Tear Us Apart.
Reading a music magazine. Puts it down. Too sick to read.
90

91

46.

As he lowers the magazine JONAH’S FACE is inches from him.
Matt GASPS. He can’t move or even breathe from terror.

The two faces so similar - both blackened - and gaunt - for a
moment it’s almost as if Matt were looking into a mirror.
Only Jonah’s intense GREEN eyes distinguishes them.

Within his terror Matt tries to act on Popescu’s ‘Fear No
Evil.’ To muster all his courage.

MATT
Wh-wh-what do you want from me?

Suddenly there is a TREMENDOUS SOUND of thousands of pieces
of glass breaking. Followed by the even LOUDER SOUND of the
whole house destroyed, like a bunker buster bomb hit it.

Matt closes his eyes in the NOISE of the BLAST. When he opens
them - Jonah’s gone. Matt crawls out of bed and up the stairs
as fast as his weak, nauseated body allows.

He warily looks out from the basement stairwell - expecting
to see the house in ruins. But everything is fine. Absolutely
normal. Matt is queasy. Out of breath. Trembling.

EXT. THE HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT 90

Sara and the kids arrive home.

INT. HOUSE —- SAME 91

Sara steps first into the kitchen, as the kids walk past her
into the living room. She drops her purse on a counter and
reaches for the tea pot and a packet of tea when she’s
stopped by the audible GASP of the children.

She turns to see into the living room - she can only see
their backs huddled together - not what they see, what they
gasped at.

She walks forward slowly and as they separate to let her in
she sees: The room’s been taken apart and rearranged - but
seemingly by a very strong, and rather obsessive, madman.

Someone has gathered all the room’s wooden furniture - and
piled it as if preparing a bonfire. All in a pyramid, the
chairs and table balanced intricately on each other. A
single breath would send it all crashing down.
92

47.

They stand there - not daring to breathe for fear it will all
come crashing down, and then they hear it. A SCRATCHING sound
from the other side of the pile. They can’t see the far wall
of the room - blocked entirely by the pile in the middle.

Sara waves the others to stay back and she carefully makes
her way around the pile to see what is on the other side of
the room making the SCRATCHING and MEWLING sounds...

And then she does see - and her eyes widen -

Sara's POV: Matt. Slumped against the wall.

The wallpaper along the wall is shredded. The wood itself
torn and frayed. And spattered with blood.

Matt’s hands are a mess. His fingers ragged bloody pulps, his
nails literally torn from his fingers - he’s been scratching
through the walls with his fingers like he was buried alive.

 

And then he speaks - in a voice DISTINCTLY NOT HIS OWN:

MATT / JONAH
Please Sir - they wants OUT...

For the sake of the others Sara literally shoves her fist
into her mouth to stifle her scream...

DR. BROOKS (0.S.)
Odd autonomic behavior.
Hallucinations. Sleepwalking.
Delirium. Mood shifts.

INT. DR. BROOKS’S OFFICE - DAY 92
A perplexed Dr. Brooks meets with Sara and Peter.

DR. BROOKS
You really should have told me. It
could have been a sign it’s moved
to the brain. Tumors cause
hallucinations, delusions, sudden
changes in behavior and the drugs
might have exacerbated them.

Sara and Peter visibly react to this.

DR. BROOKS (CONT’D)
But it’s alright. Matt’s MRI’s are
all clear. He has no brain tumors.
Whatever caused the behaviors, or
hallucinations, it isn’t that.
48.

SARA
I’m afraid he’1l lose his mind
before he can get better.

He can see the worry in their weary eyes.

DR. BROOKS
This is the crucial time. He’s had
a complete round of treatments now.
By the trial protocols we can’t
give him anymore. And I don’t think
his body could tolerate it.

SARA
So what do we do now?

DR. BROOKS
We wait and see. He’s still a great
candidate for this treatment. Age
counts enormously. And attitude.

PETER
Attitude? He feels like shit all
the time. He looks like hell. No
one wants to get near him. His own
family are afraid of him. How’s he
gonna have the power of positive
thinking on his side?

DR. BROOKS
There’s a number of good drugs.
It’s quite common for cancer
patients to take something for
anxiety or depression.

PETER
That’s it? Just more prescriptions?
What’s the point?

DR. BROOKS
The point is not to let his
attitude interfere with the
medicine. Make sure he gets well.
The rest will work itself out.

PETER
And if it doesn’t?

DR. BROOKS
If things don’t improve you might
want to consider residential care.
Perhaps until he’s feeling better.
93

49,

SARA
“Residential care?”

PETER
He means committing him.

SARA
It’s bad enough he’s so sick -
you're suggesting we put him away?

DR. BROOKS
I’m just making sure you know your
options. And remember...

EXT. BACK YARD - SAME TIME 93
Pale and weak, Matt plays catch with Billy.

DR. BROOKS (0.S.)
He’s not your only child.

They’re just tossing it lightly. Matt’s too weak for anything
more. In fact he misses an easy toss. The ball rolls away
from him towards the house. Billy starts to run after it -
but Matt frustrated yells -

MATT
No. I got it.

He hobbles over to the ball. Bends so his head is right
beside the lower window and hears a POUNDING on the window!

Matt stumbles back - away from the window. Nearly falling.
And we see why - in the window - JONAH - blackened and open
mouthed - silently screaming at Matt.

BILLY
What is it?

MATT
Can’t you see him?

Billy looks at his big brother - not wanting to believe he’s
crazy or losing it. Matt turns from Billy's face back to the
house - and we see Matt’s POV:

Jonah’s sullen, silent face looks out from the window with
eyes filled with pain.

Billy searches all the windows of the house.
94

50.

BILLY
I don’t see anyone! I don’t!

With all his strength Matt flings the ball at a window,
smashing it. He grabs and turns Billy, to steer his eyes.

MATT
There. Face all black - and
screaming - and horrible -

Billy looks at his brother- it’s like Matt’s describing
himself at that moment.

MATT (CONT’D)
Can’t you see him!?

BILLY
No! I can’t. Get off of me!

He spins and all too easily knocks Matt down - that’s the
most horrible part - his once strong big brother drops like a
sack of dried leaves as Wendy comes running out of the house.

WENDY
What are you doing! Billy stop,
you’re hurting him!

BILLY
He -

WENDY
What?!

Billy looks down at his older brother, someone he looked up
to, who now seems so shriveled and weak.

BILLY
Nothing. We were just fooling
around.

Matt throws a silent look of thanks to his younger brother.
But Billy doesn’t nod back. He just hurries towards the house
to put distance between him and Matt. Wendy reaches out to
help Matt up. He ignores her. Crawls back to his feet.

EXT. HOSPITAL - SAME TIME 94

Finished with Dr Brooks, Sara and Peter exit together. But
silent. Lost in their own thoughts and fears.

They pause at the hospital parking lot - separate vehicles.
He’s not by his truck - but a small banged up little car.
95

96

95B

96B

51.

SARA

Where’s the truck, in the shop?
PETER

I sold it.
SARA

You what? Why didn’t you tell me?

PETER
I just did. Paid the last round of
bills and this month’s mortgage.
But hey like Doc said, Attitude!

She watches him go. Not at all sure about his ‘attitude’.
Or hers for that matter.

INT. SARA’S BEDROOM - THAT NIGHT 95

Breathes, to pull herself together. She picks up a book from
her bedside table, of uplifting affirmations. She reads them
one by one - out loud - as she does - we cut back and forth
between her - and Peter back in New York.

SARA
“I now put my body into a peak
state of absolute certainty knowing
that I can create any positive
result that I am committed to.”

INT. NEW YORK HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT 96
Peter has his head in hands at the table. Beaten.
IN SARA'S BEDROOM: 95B
SARA

“Whenever I set a definite goal, I

take immediate action towards its

attainment to create and sustain

massive momentum.”
BACK IN NEW YORK: 96B
Peter has an old slide projector in the basement. The room in

total darkness. Then with a whir and a click - a frozen
moment of Family Happiness Past.
52.

95Cc IN SARA'S BEDROOM: 95C
Sara’s crying as she continues her ‘affirmations’.

SARA
“I now relive the most joyous
moments of my life. “”

96C BACK IN NEW YORK: 96C

Peter fights crying, as scenes from happier days unfold in
the succession of frozen moments punctuated by darkness and
the whirring and shifting of the automatic slide mechanism.

On screen: Matt as a little boy leaps off a picnic table his
Superman cape streaming back behind him - as if he were
flying not falling.

SARA (0.S.)
“And these moments inspire me to
greater confidence and a greater
feeling of self-worth.”

Suddenly - the old slide mechanism catches on dust. The slide
sticks half in and out throwing the image at a disturbing
angle. Peter tries to grab the slide and burns his hand
trying to get it out and in frustration knocks the projector
onto the floor where it lies still throwing a now sideways
image of old family happiness against the wall.

97 INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 97

Peter opens the freezer door. It’s filled with frozen
dinners, leftovers, and ice - he shoves his hand into the
pile of ice. To cool the burn.

Then shoves things out of the way - digging through the ice
till he finds - a frozen bottle of vodka. He stares at it.
While we hear still hear Sara’s voice - and her affirmations -

SARA (0.S.) (CONT'D)
“I am now fearless, courageous, and
bold. Filled with faith, certainty
and confidence. I now create and
feel these emotions in my body.”
98

96D

99

53.

EXT. THE NEW YORK HOUSE - LATE NIGHT 98

There’s a light on in the basement, though all the other
houses around it are dark, everyone on the block is asleep.
Except for Peter. Before we see him, we can hear him.

INT. NEW YORK HOUSE - BASEMENT - SAME 96D

Peter’s down there playing an old electric guitar - get the
sense he was in a garage band back in the day. He’s playing
some heavy metal riff, or perhaps some old Allman Brothers,
like “Midnight Rider”. He looks way too intense doing it.

The reason is - next to him on a table - stands that fifth of
vodka he found earlier in the freezer. It’s empty now, and he
is thoroughly shit-faced.

Suddenly one of the guitar’s wire strings snaps and nearly
hits him in the eye. Enraged, Peter starts to smash his
guitar, the table, smash anything he can get his hands on -
in a rage against his fate, his son’s fate, enraged at a God
who could let an innocent boy suffer as Matt is suffering.
EXT. THE HOUSE - DAY 99

Bright hot summer light casts deep black shadows.

INT. PARLOUR - DAY 100

Inside. Wendy’s reading on the couch. The two young ones
fighting over a board game. They turn imploringly to Wendy.

BILLY
We're bored.

MARY
Please play a game with us.

WENDY
Why don’t you ask Matt?

They remain silent, uncomfortable.

MATT (0.S.)
Yeah. Why don’t you ask Matt.

Matt is standing in the doorway. Who knows how long.
101

102

101B

54.

WENDY
Are you alright?

MATT
Outstanding.

Wendy doesn’t like the look in his eyes. Or the grim tone of
his voice. And clearly the kids don’t either. They’re
standing nervously on the verge of tears.
WENDY
OK, c’mon you guys. I’1l count to
30. And let’s see if you can find
some new hiding places this time.
The littler ones run upstairs. Matt’s still standing there,
staring. His face has an odd cast to it. Head bent, one eye
raised a bit above the other: he almost looks like Jonah.
WENDY (CONT’D)
Matt?
(no response)
Matt?

Matt turns and walks back out of the room, down to his lair.

INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 101

Billy races past Mary. Both heading straight for the little
elevator door in the hallway. But Billy’s already in there.

MARY
There’s room for me too.

BILLY
Find your own place.

He pulls the door shut.

INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS 102

Uncomfortably tight and dark in there. Just cracks of light.

INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 101B
Mary runs in and out of the rooms.

WENDY (0.S.)
28-29-30. Ready or not here I come.
103

101¢c

104

103B

101D

104B

101E

55.

Then Mary looks to the end of the hall - the attic stairs.
A short flight up to a shortened door. And the door is open.
Giggling, she races up the stairs on little cat feet.

INT. ATTIC - A BEAT LATER 103

Sound of little FOOTSTEPS. Something seems to be running in
the far back of the attic as Mary opens the door and enters.

That same extreme of dark and light from outside - but here
with darkness winning and just a few shafts of high hot light
through dust.

INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 101¢

Wendy comes up the stairs - not in any hurry to find any one.

INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS 104
Billy’s trying to make no noise - but it’s dark - and stuffy -
and a little scary in there. It seems for an instant like
there’s something else in there - something behind him.

INT. ATTIC - CONTINUOUS 103B
Mary's tiptoeing into the back of the little attic. Looking
for a good hiding place. The section of the floor in the rear
is so rotten it just dissolves. Mary screams as her leg
breaks through the rotted floor -

INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 101D

Wendy hears the scream from the attic.

INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS 104B
Billy sees something behind him: he’s sharing the elevator
with JONAH. He screams in terror.

INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 101E

Hearing the scream, Wendy yanks the door open and Billy comes
tumbling out of the empty elevator.

BILLY
I saw - there was-
105

103C

56.

But another scream from the attic cuts him off - and Wendy
bolts down the hall and up the attic stairs.

INT. MATT’S BEDROOM —- CONTINUOUS 105

Matt hears too. And makes his way upstairs as fast as he can.

INT. ATTIC - A BEAT LATER 103C

Wendy runs in. The door slams shut behind her. Plunging the
attic back to near total darkness but for the shafts of dust
strewn light from cracks and narrow windows.

She can’t see well, has to mostly feel with her hand - she
finds Mary’s leg but not before her hand breaks through wood
so rotten you can see spiders and silver fish crawling in it.

Matt comes in followed by Billy. He hurries to where his
sister and cousin are.

WENDY
Be careful. Floor must be rotten.

MATT
Rotten? Where?

As he walks he tests the floor and gestures it’s all fine.

WENDY
Well here for sure. Where Mary's
leg fell through.

Matt walks to that spot - sees a small circle is fetid and
rotting. He looks up at the ceiling above that spot.

MATT
The floor’s fine everywhere except
here. No sign of a leak. Weird. Why
should only this spot be rotten?

Matt gently pulls Mary’s leg free. He looks down at the hole
his sister’s foot made. And sees something down there. He
reaches in - and pulls out a metal box and a sheaf of thick
papers stuffed in a bulging rotting leather notebook.

Wendy opens the box, glances, then immediately slams it shut.

MATT/BILLY/MARY
What?

She looks at Matt. Her face drained of color.
106

67C

107

57.

MATT
OK. Game over.

He shoos the little kids out.

INT. PARLOR - NIGHT 106
After the kids are asleep. Matt and Wendy sit at the table.
In front of them are the cigar box and the notebook. We've
seen these before. When Aickman was inscribing the corpse.

In the cigar box - a mass of small photos - mourning cards
featuring the photo of the deceased. Many coffin shots: Old
people. Middle-aged people. Kids. Babies even. Lying there on
satin, all peaceful and serene and dead. There’s more than a
hundred of the business-card sized photos.

And something else too - the box is nearly filled with what
at first appear to be dead moths.

WENDY
What are these?

Matt picks one up -
FLASH CUT TO:
Aickman's long fingers pull gently on a corpse's eyelids.

MATT
I don’t know.

He drops the little thing back into the box. Then pulls out
the memorial cards. Spreads them out in front of him -

FLASH CUT TO:

MATT’S HORRIFIC EXPERIENCE BEFORE IN THE EMBALMING ROOM: 67C
Matt/Jonah trapped between the pressing dead - their lidless
eyes stare wide - their lipless mouths press at his ears -
their nail-less hands paw at him - we recognize some of
these tormented faces as identical to the memorial cards.
BACK IN THE PRESENT: 107
Matt drops the photos on the floor.

WENDY
You alright?
58.

MATT
(bending to pick them up)
Y-yeah. Sure.

Wendy opens the notebook. Much is in Latin - and other
stranger languages - unreadable ciphers. And drawings.
Diagrams. What looks like a hand drawn plan of a house with
strange inscriptions and lines all over it - almost like an
electrical plan. She turns to the photos.

WENDY
These are really weird.

ANGLE ON:

These are different. Not photos of the dead. But of the
living contacting the dead. Seances. Spirit photographs. We
might recognize the setting and the participants from Matt’s
glimpse of the seance while saying grace.

Stiff black and white photos that yet have a kind of
unspeakable horror about them. Unposed, off-angle, capturing
sitters in states of horrid fascination and terror.

And the boy medium, Jonah, in mid-spirit possession: slightly
out-of-focus, his body wracked, twisted, face contorted,
mouth gaping wide as translucent tendrils of smoke-like
ectoplasm flow out of him.

In others the ectoplasm can be seen more clearly and looks
like strings or slabs of grey, greasy meat that extrude from
his hands, his chest, even his face, during the sittings.

WENDY
These have got to be fake.

MATT
Let me see.

He takes one look - and Wendy notices Matt turning a whiter
shade of pale than usual.

WENDY
What?

MATT
Nothing.

WENDY

Matt. Stop it. Talk to me.

MATT
You don’t want to know.
59.

WENDY
Give me a chance.

He stares at her - as if silently measuring her - can she
take it, will she believe? Only one way to find out.

MATT
I’ve seen him.
WENDY
Who?
MATT
(tapping photo of Jonah)
Him.
WENDY
Shut up.
MATT
(getting up)

OK, forget it.

WENDY
No. Wait, I’m sorry. Go on.

MATT

Here. In this house. I thought I
was hallucinating. But I’m telling
you. I’ve seen him nearly everyday
since we moved here. Sometimes I
can see him in my room. And other
times I wake in the night and it
feels like he’s been inside me -
looking out through my eyes...

She just looks at Matt.

MATT (CONT’D)
One bright day in the middle of the
night/Two dead boys got up to fight
(pointing to Jonah)
Me and him. Just two dead boys.

The two of them stare at these photos of a by-gone era,
feeling their horror in the here and now.

WENDY
Maybe the place is haunted. Or
Maybe you picked up some kind of
vibrations of the past. Either way,
what were these things and these
photos doing hidden under

(MORE )
108

109

60.

WENDY (CONT'D)
the floor boards? Who put them
there and why? We need to find out
who lived here. Who these people
are. Or were.

MATT
How?

Wendy leans in and whispers, conspiratorially:

WENDY
Don’t tell anyone. But there’s
buildings all over the country
where secret knowledge is kept.
Mysterious places known only as ...
The library!

Matt smiles. His first in a very long time.

MATT
Thank you.

WENDY
For what?

MATT
For believing me.

INT. LIBRARY - DAY 108

Wendy’s research takes her from Microfilm to the back rooms
of the stacks where dusty volumes of forgotten periodicals
and esoteric tomes hide from the mice and the silverfish.

And_as Wendy begins her quest, we begin to Intercut: all
she’s learning and how she’s learning it(in bold) with her
sharing her discoveries with Matt in the parlor that evening:

INT. MICROFILM READERS - MONTAGE 109

Her face illuminated by the old microfilm readers as she
hunts through old issues of the local paper. First some from
the 1920's. Featuring photos of Aickman. And some of Jonah.

WENDY (0.S.)
Check it out: ‘A Case of
Materialization’ by Mr. Ramsey
Aickman, of Goatswood, Connecticut.
110

110B

61.

INT. THE PARLOR - EVENING 110

Wendy’s research is spread out on the table. She points to a
picture of Aickman.

WENDY
That’s Ramsey Aickman. This was his
mortuary. He had an interesting
hobby: psychical research.

Sliding quickly across the screen we see Microfilm of old
newspaper. Glimpse fragments and sentences from articles:

HEADLINE:
LOCAL MAN CONTACTS THE DEAD!
SKEPTICS CONVINCED!

WENDY (0.S.)
Your guy, the dead kid? Jonah.
Aickman’s assistant. And a medium.

ARTICLE:
With the help of a Boy Medium,
Aickman holds weekly seances...
“Rare manifestations of
ectoplasm...”

WENDY (0.S.)
Supposedly they contacted the dead
through Jonah - and people came to
have little chats with their dead
hubby or wife or to find out where
Auntie Mame hid the family jewels.

More clippings slide over the screen, funerary announcements
in the name of R. Aickman, Funeral Director and Mortician.
And small listings in the local events pages of Spiritualist
Evenings held at the Aickman Mortuary and Funeral Home.

INT. PARLOR - EVENING 110B
Back with them:

WENDY
He claims he discovered how to
‘amplify’ seances, not just contact
the dead. He made things appear.

MATT
What things?
62.

WENDY
Ectoplasm.

MATT
Ectoplasm? What’s that?

108B INT. BASEMENT LIBRARY STACKS - DAY 108B

A row of dusty volumes marked on the spine: Proceedings of
the Society for Psychical Research. She pulls down the
volumes from 1927. Wendy reads from her notes:

WENDY (0.S.)
“BR mysterious protoplasmic
substance streaming out of the body
of mediums.’ Check this out -

Books stacked around her; She pores through the dusty volumes
- staring at old gray photos, making copious notes. See
horrific spirit photographs like the ones from the attic.

WENDY
(quoting again)
- “photographs of ectoplasm often
show a gelatinous material oozing
from all the natural orifices of
the medium; from mouth, ears, nose,
eyes, and even the lower orifices,
and sometimes from the top of the
head, the breasts or fingertips.”

110C INT. PARLOR: 110C

She points to the photos they found in the attic: the
ectoplasm coming from Jonah.

WENDY
People came from all over and were
convinced. Harvard professors and
other big shots. Aickman and
Jonah’s seances were famous.

MATT
So do we know what became of them?

WENDY
OK. Now it gets weirder.

Fill the screen with Microfilm of old newspaper:
63.

HEADLINE:
SEANCE OF DEATH! SIX DEAD; ONE
MISSING

WENDY (0.S.)

There was a seance. Led by Aickman
with Jonah as the Medium. Aickman
and all five sitters were found
dead. Cause of death not clear.

Glimpse fragments and sentences from the article:

ARTICLE:
..-bodies scorched but no sign of
fire...spontaneous combustion?
Contorted faces...Boy Missing...

MATT (0.S.)
Jonah? Did he kill them?

WENDY (0.S.)
Nobody knows. No sign of him.
Vanished. Missing. And never seen
again.

MATT (0.S.)
Till now.

WENDY (0.S.)
Here’s the weirdest part of all.

Now papers blur past - some from decades later -

HEADLINE:
ROAD EXTENSION SCANDAL

SUB-HEAD:
WHERE ARE THE BODIES?

WENDY (0.S.)
Thirty years later - in the ‘50s,
when they expanded the highway,
they did a detour through the
county cemetery -

MATT (0.S.)
We've been on it a million times on
the way to the hospital.

Hear all this while seeing bits and pieces of the microfilms:
64.

ARTICLE:

Excavations to link the town with
the Turnpike reveal shocking...
Coffins filled with sand bags and
stones... Over one hundred bodies
unaccounted for... Possible links
with mysterious death of local
mortician thirty years ago...

WENDY (0.S.)

Right. But when they tried to re-
locate some of the old plots they
found something odd. Or didn’t
find.

MATT (0.S.)
What?

WENDY (0.S.)

More than a hundred bodies that
were supposed to be there? Weren't.
Coffins just filled with rocks.

END MONTAGE

110D INT. BACK IN THE PARLOR: 110D

Where the two sit sifting through xeroxes, photos, off-
prints, and a mystery too immense for them to unravel:

WENDY
Someone jacked the bodies.
MATT
Aickman? Jonah?
WENDY
Maybe. But why?
MATT
I have no idea. But I know someone
who might.
111 EXT. THE HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT 111

A very old, well maintained 1966 Mercedes Benz pulls up in
front of the house. Popescu gets out.
112

113

65.

INT. THE HOUSE - A BEAT LATER 112

Popescu and the teens sit at the table with a candle and cups
of tea. Popescu’s looking through Aickman’s papers filled
with diagrams and incantations - and the seance photographs.

POPESCU
Remarkable.

WENDY
You don’t think it’s real do you?

POPESCU
I’ve seen plenty of fakes. And I’ve
seen the real thing. Once. In
Paris. Most horrible thing I’ve
ever seen. Now... this.

He holds up the strangest of the photos. Caught in the glare
of a flash an eerie Black and White moment -

- the table sitters with varying degrees of shock and horror
on their face - as what looks vaguely like an out-of-focus
jelly-fish made of liver extrudes from Jonah’s face.

POPESCU (CONT’D)
He must have been a very powerful
medium.

Wendy pushes the box towards him for Popescu to inspect. He
looks at the contents of the box. And recoils. He pulls out
some of the photos, shaking his head in sorrow.

He picks up several of the delicate ‘moths’ from the box.
Pieces of skin. He holds them over the candle - and drops
them into the flame - At the instant the things burn we -
INT. MARY’S BEDROOM - SAME TIME 113

Mary's not asleep. She’s up, playing with her doll house and
dolls. Talking aloud, playing all the parts of various dolls.

MARY/FEMALE DOLL
Well you said so, but you lied!

MARY/MALE DOLL
No I didn’t!

MARY/FEMALE DOLL
Oh yes you did, you said you would!
112B

66.

While she’s moving the dolls around in their house, we see
through it and out the little doll window to the walls behind
Mary where: Suddenly we can see someone standing there behind

 

her - naked, and covered in Aickman’s inscriptions and their

 

head_is flickering horribly. But Mary doesn’t notice.
BACK DOWNSTAIRS: 112B

The little things burning in the candle trail a grey line of
smoke. Popescu leans over, and with a wave of his hand draws
the smoke into his nostrils - smelling it -

MATT
What are you doing?
POPESCU
Being sure. And now I am.
MATT
What are they?
POPESCU
Eyelids. Human eyelids.
WENDY
You could tell by the way they
smelled?
POPESCU

Burning. Yes. And don’t ask why I
know that smell.

WENDY
What are they for?

POPESCU
Necromancy. Corpse bothering. A
loathsome form of magic. Seeking
power through the control of the
dead via relics of their bodies.

MATT
Why eyelids?

POPESCU
Good question. To make them ever
watchful? Are they the guardians of
this house - or of his secrets?
Maybe. But either way, somewhere
there are bodies that belong to
these people. And he used them.

(MORE )
67.

POPESCU (CONT'D)
I think ultimately Aickman meant to
enhance Jonah’s powers.

WENDY
He ‘amplified’ his seances.

POPESCU
Somehow he used the dead, yes, as
an amplifier. Perhaps buried out-
side the house. Perhaps still in
the cemetery.

WENDY
Not in the cemetery.

She pulls out the clipping about all the empty coffins. He
scans it. Then gets up - and begins to move about the room.

POPESCU
I don’t know. But -

His eyes search the place. Nothing. Though something out of
the corner of his eyes.

He doesn’t turn his head - but attends to it - sees it - and
we do too - It’s Jonah.

POPESCU (CONT’D)
They’re not here. But him...

He taps on the photo of Jonah.

POPESCU (CONT’D)
He’s here. He’s the one who’s been
trying to reach you. I can feel it.
I even saw him for a moment there.

Both kids snap their heads around, “looking” for Jonah.

MATT
Why is he still here?

POPESCU
Hard to say. If he committed a
terrible act he might be trapped-

WENDY
-at the scene of the crime.

POPESCU
Crime? Who knows? Sometimes the
most evil actions are committed in
the very name of the good. Did
Aickman perform necromancy?

(MORE )
53B

68.

POPESCU (CONT'D)
Perhaps. But whatever blasphemy he
may have wrought, Mr. Aickman was
after the greatest Good of all.

MARY
What good?

POPESCU
To prove to a world sunk in doubt
that there is light beyond the
dark, life beyond the grave, and a
benevolent God at the heart of the

universe... Pray with me. For those
that died here. And for the boy,
too...

He reaches out his hands to the young people across the table
- they all join hands to pray - But the INSTANT they do -
once again it’s like some infernal circuit completed - Matt’s
eyes widen and we go shooting into his eyes and back out to
what he sees:

He sees not here and now - but there and then - this same
spot - 60 years ago - during the seance -

 

AND WE ARE:

INT. THE PARLOR - BACK IN 1927 53B
..-right back to the original seance. Right where we left it:

The table begins to tremble beneath their fingers - the legs
rattling against the floor.

All the sitters eyes now on Jonah who clamps his eyes shut.
Beads of sweat rise from every pore on his face. Tiny bumps
all over his skin.

Then as a low unearthly moan rises from the depths of his
belly, his face grimaces - the skin stretches tight - as if
there were a tremendous wind bearing down upon him - except
there is no wind.

As Jonah shakes, and shudders convulsively, another sound
rises from within him - it begins as a moan - a wet moan -
with a kind of slurping shucking sound as if something were
literally rising from some internal sea within him.

With a sucking gasp, Jonah's mouth opens suddenly - wide -
wider - impossibly wide - as if his face must rip in half.

Suddenly a CHOKING SOUND from the boy - as something finally
begins to emerge from his mouth...
112c

69.

The ECTOPLASM.

We only see it for briefest flashes: This is not an airy
substance of light and spirit. More like an infernal
combination of dusty smoke and crumbling rotted meat - as if
smoke were a kind of flesh.

SPIN AND FLASH RAPIDLY BETWEEN:

The ectoplasm emerging from the boy's mouth and nose, and
even pouring like living tears from his eyes and the
horrified faces of the sitters staring at Jonah.

Suddenly their horror seems to rise - even Aickman stares at
us - at JONAH - as if something worse than anticipated were
happening - something monstrous emerging from him - and then
in an instant something unseen - Flesh? Light? Fire? - hurls
Aickman and the sitters back and to the ground.

BACK IN THE PRESENT: 112Cc

In the parlor - Popescu and Wendy are raising their heads at
the end of Popescu’s prayer - while still holding each
other’s and Matt’s hands. Suddenly they hear an eerie GROAN.
It’s come from Matt. They turn to him -

He is gagging as if something were rising in his throat - and
though there are no open windows they both suddenly feel a
strong cold wind blow through the room.

WENDY
Matt? Was it?

Popescu sees that Matt’s in a kind of trance and releases his
hand. Wendy still holds the other.

POPESCU
Let go of his hand -

She tries but in his trance Matt is squeezing her hand
tighter and tighter.

WENDY
I can’t!

Popescu reaches out and with all the strength he has pulls
her hand free from Matt’s. As soon as their hands are
separated Matt gasps and falls face first down on the table.

SARA (0.S.)
What is going on here?!
70.

Sara - home from work - has walked right into this odd scene.

SARA (CONT'D)
What happened to Matt? Who are you?
What are you doing in my house?

Popescu checks Matt’s pulse and temperature.

POPESCU
He’s alright. I think he fainted.
Let’s get him to the couch.

They talk as they carry a woozy Matt to the nearby sofa.

SARA
Are you a doctor?

POPESCU
No.

He hands her his card. She glances at it and drops it into
her coat pocket.

SARA
A priest?

WENDY
We asked for his help -

POPESCU
We met at the hospital. I’m
receiving treatment there.

SARA
What are you doing here this time
of night? What happened to Matt?

Sara leans over Matt, as he comes to, waving her away.

MATT
I- I’m alright.

POPESCU
He called me. For advice. It’s hard
to explain.

SARA
Try.

POPESCU
I believe there is something evil
in this house. Something no longer
living. But not passed over.

(MORE )
113B

114

71.

POPESCU (CONT'D)
And it wants your son. That’s a
very dangerous situation for
someone who is potentially close to
death -

SARA
He is not -

POPESCU
- I am as hopeful as you. But tell
me - have you not felt something
strange here?

Of course she has. But can’t admit it. Or won't.

SARA
I have no idea what you're talking
about. I appreciate your trying to
help my son but I think it’s best
if we leave that to the doctors.

POPESCU
Of course. But please. If you
ever...need any help.

SARA
I’m sure we won’t need your help.
And if I do - I’1l call Doctor
Brooks.

POPESCU
Yes, of course.

INT. MARY’S BEDROOM —- CONTINUOUS 113B

As Mary plays with her dolls we see a shape behind her -
moving. She doesn’t see it. One of the inscribed dead looms

over Mary.

Staring down over the top of the doll house. Mary senses the
presence and slowly, slowly, looks up...

INT. THE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 114

As Sara is coming up the stairs, Mary comes running out of
her room - SCREAMING.

She runs like a straight into Sara - nearly knocking her
down. Sara quiets Mary down.
115

72.

SARA
It was just a bad dream, honey.
That’s all it was.

MARY
What does he want?

SARA
Who?

MARY

The ugly man.

SARA
Just a monster in your dream.

MARY
He had tattoos. And I wasn’t
sleeping. I was playing with my
dolls.
Sara leads her back into her bedroom.
SARA
There’s no one here. It was just a
bad dream.
Sara tucks her into bed and reaches for the light.

MARY
No Mommy. Please. Leave it on.

SARA
Alright. If you’re a good girl and
go back to sleep.
She shuts the door and doesn’t hear Mary muttering.

MARY
But I wasn’t asleep.

And as she pulls the cover around her we drift away out the
window into the summer night - pulling back until we are:
EXT. THE HOUSE - NIGHT 115

A moonless night. The house a dark shadow in a sea of deeper
darkness. With one light still shining - from Mary’s room.

SUPER: August 22nd. Two nights later. 1:00 A.M.
116

117

73.

Now we float back towards the house - but not to Mary’s now
continuously lit window but to the dark window of...

INT. SARA AND PETER’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 116

Where Sara’s asleep. She shifts in her sleep. Perhaps
distantly aware of the strange sound in her bedroom:
FOOTSTEPS. Pacing. Back and forth in front of the bed.

Sara’s eyes snap awake. She hears the FOOTSTEPS. She raises
her head - can’t see anything in the room. But can distinctly
hear FOOTSTEPS in the room. Marching back and forth in front
of her bed.

SARA
Peter?

No reply. But suddenly the footsteps stop - right next to
where she’s lying.

SARA (CONT'D)
Matt?

She reaches out a hand slowly - to light the bedside lamp -
and when she does for a flash it illuminates neither her
husband nor her son but:

The same inscribed ghost who was in Mary’s room. His hideous
face just an inch from her face as it whispers in a foul
hissing voice:

DEAD MAN
Do... you... know... what... they
did ... to.. us?

Sara screams, leaps out of bed and turns the overhead light
on. The room is empty.
EXT. THE HOUSE - NIGHT 117

In the still dark and moonless light there are now two lit
windows.

SUPER: August 23rd. The next night. 1:00 AM
118

119

74.

INT. WENDY'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 118

Wendy's asleep. As she tosses and turns we hear strange
sounds in the darkness - as if cages were opening - and birds
were flying out of the cages and around the room - though in
the darkness we can’t see it. It sounds as if they are
flapping all around her, wilder and wilder.

Suddenly with a THWACK it sounds like one of the birds
smashed against the window next to the bed.

Wendy wakes and looks around in the darkness, heart pounding.
She throws her arm out of the covers and lights the lamp

beside her bed. This lights her bed - and stops the sound of
flapping wings - but the corners of the room are still dark.

No birds sounds now. Just a low heavy rasping breathing...

And she senses: the room is not empty. Someone is there in
the shadows, staring at her.

WENDY (CONT’D)
Matt? What are you doing? What do
you want?

No reply. She just sees one of the eyes in the dark, staring
at her. For a second it seems as if we can see the frozen
mist from someone’s breath.

Then a mouth opens - and a small faint croak. Barely human.
Wholly unintelligible. Wendy tilts the lamp shade towards
that corner of the room -

- and for a second illuminates a corner where not Matt - but
a_horribly burned and scared Jonah crouches staring at her!

 

She leaps out of bed and turns the full room light on. Then
looks around. The room is empty. No Matt. No Jonah. Just her.
EXT. THE HOUSE - NIGHT 119
Lights on now from the basement to the upper floor. Against
the big dark sky the house seems like a doll house.
Transparent and vulnerable - visible to the invisible.

Super: August 23rd 1:30 a.m.

Hear, then we see, Peter’s car creeping slowly, overly
cautiously down the street, the way some drunks drive.
120

75.

The car has trouble finding the curb. And given his mumbling
and awkward door closing - we can smell the alcohol on him.
He looks up at the house all lit up. Checks his watch.

PETER
Now I see why I hadda sell my
Goddamn truck.

INT. THE HOUSE - A BEAT LATER 120

Peter comes into the house - masks his drunken clumsiness
beneath belligerence which only makes him seem drunker.

He storms down and back up the stairs. See that each of the
kids is sleeping with the light on. He stands on the landing
of the stairs and yells:

PETER
Every body in this Goddamn house is
sleeping with the light on. And I
want to know why.

They all peep from their rooms. And look at each other. But
even more at the frightening spectacle of their drunk and
rageful father and husband.

PETER (CONT'D)
Why do you all keep the lights on?

They all look at each other - who’s gonna say something?

PETER (CONT'D)
I don’t care what little games you
all are playing -

He grabs a footstool - and goes room to room - with a
handkerchief around his hand - unscrewing the light bulbs,
ignoring everyone’s pleas for him to stop.

PETER (CONT'D)
There!

Peter even grabs the night lights from the little one’s beds.
Mary is trembling and crying - Billy’s sniffling and just as
scared. Sara seems speechless with rage.

PETER (CONT'D)
You’re all too old to be sleeping
with night lights.

Peter storms out. We hear him outside: SMASHING the bulbs in
the trash cans. Sara storms out after him.
121

76.

Wendy comforts the younger children. The house is now truly
dark - without a light bulb left in the bedrooms. She looks
out a window and sees Sara confronting Peter outside - She

turns the kids away and leads them upstairs.

EXT. THE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 121
Peter tosses the last of the bulbs in the garbage can.

SARA
That was a cruel and childish thing
to do. All you’ve done is scare
everyone in this house.

PETER
Yeah, what scares me is trying to
pay for two sets of bills every
month.

SARA
Stop it. This isn’t about any of
that anymore. That’s it.

PETER
What?
SARA
That was it right there.
PETER
What?
SARA

Your second chance. You asked a
long time ago - for a second
chance. And I said, if you ever
came home drunk and violent and
scaring or hurting me or the
children again, that was it. I
should’ve known then. How weak you
are. That you’d fold at the worst
possible time.

He opens his mouth as if to begin to defend or explain.

SARA (CONT'D)
Don’t. This is it, Peter. This is
where you step up to the plate. Or
you don’t. And you didn’t. Now I
will not let you hurt this family.
Not again. Is that clear?
122

123

124

125

77.

Peter slams the door of his little car. His big frame almost
too big to fit in it. Starts it up. And pulls out. Sara, as

sad as she is angry, watches Peter pull out of the driveway,
headed home. With no idea if he’s coming back.

INT. THE HOUSE - LATER 122
All the lights are off. For the first time in many nights.
And we see why:

INT. SARA AND PETER’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 123

ANGLES ON:

The ceiling fixture. The bedside lamp. No bulbs in either.

INTS. THE OTHER TWO BEDROOMS - SAME TIME 124

In Wendy’s room. And down in Matt’s. No bulbs in any of the
fixtures. Thanks to Peter’s rage there’s not a single bulb in
the house. Just empty sockets, and inextinguishable darkness.
Not a good feeling.

And now a sound. A KNOCKING. At first as if at the door
downstairs. And then at the windows upstairs. And downstairs.

Soon - they are all awake. All listening to the insistent,
and incessantly moving - KNOCKING.

And then. Suddenly. In all of those rooms. As well as the two
little ones’ bedrooms where the bulbs were also removed.
Lights FLASH ON. And OFF. ON. AND OFF. From all the lights
where there are no bulbs. Light. And off.

SARA
What in the name of God...

Wendy comes out of her room. Matt weakly walks up the stairs.
They all end up huddled with Sara on her bed - as the lights
go on and off. They all come together. Then all the lights go
out. Total blackness. And silence.

INT. THE KITCHEN - DAY 125

Sara’s alone on the phone. She looks as if she hasn’t slept.
She hasn’t. None of them have. She’s on hold -
78.

RECEPTIONIST (0.S.)
(on phone)
I’m sorry Dr. Brooks’s on rounds
this afternoon. Can I take a
message?

SARA
No - no - it’s- nothing. Thanks.

She puts down the phone and just stares. Lost. Who can she
call? Who would believe? Or have any idea? She grabs her
wallet and looks hurriedly through it- whatever she’s looking
for isn’t there. She tries the purse. Nope. Then she steps
int the hallway where her coat is hanging and reaches into
the pocket and pulls out a card.

Fr. Popescu’s card that he gave her the night he was there.

126 EXT. THE HOUSE - EVENING 126
An old car parks in front. Out steps the rather tiny old man.
Super: August 24th 9:00 PM.

From the front window, Sara watches Popescu come up the walk-
way. As he walks up the path he’s dwarfed by the dark old
house. He stops on the threshold and visibly shudders.

From Sara's POV he looks tiny. Even smaller than last time
she saw him. She can't help but wonder - this is the man
who’s going to save them? She opens the door for him.

SARA
I’m so sorry. I didn’t know who
else to call. Are you sure you’re
feeling up to this?

POPESCU
(with a twinkle)
Let’s put it this way. I’m in
exactly the right state of being
to traffic with ghosts.

127 INT. THE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 127

He puts down his little black bag. And opens it. Takes out
his Bible. And what appears to be a cross.

SARA
You’re not actually a priest
anymore. Are you?
79.

POPESCU
There’s what I am. And then there’s
what I am permitted officially to
do.

He does something odd with his ‘cross’ - he pulls it apart.
It’s actually two metal bars. Magnets.

SARA
What is that?

POPESCU
Iron magnets. One of the few
constants in human thought. From
Ancient Babylon to the most modern
construction - people have always
know Iron has special properties.
They may not know why. Or even why
they still use it. But the truth is
Iron defends from Evil. And the
iron magnet can detect it. It’s no
accident prisons have iron bars.
Not merely to contain the body but
the evil that may lurk within it.

Without waiting for Sara he begins moving about the house.
Looking around.

SARA
What are you looking for?

POPESCU
Where he died. Sometimes - when a
death is violent - or filled with
anger, fear, or any strong emotion -
it’s as if the spirit doesn’t pass
on - but moves instantly into the
nearest body, the house itself.
It’s why we cover mirrors and open
window shades in the house of the
dead - to help them find their way
out. A house where a soul is
trapped is not so much haunted, as
possessed.

Moving his magnets near the walls - when he thinks he might
feel something. He walks towards the basement stairs.

POPESCU (CONT’D)
What’s down here?

SARA
Matt's bedroom. Where they used to -
80.

POPESCU
Keep the children upstairs.

128 INT. THE BASEMENT STAIRS - A BEAT LATER 128

Sara leads Popescu down. Popescu stops. Moves his magnets.
Then carries on, into Matt’s bedroom. Matt lies weakly on his
bed. Popescu stares at him - no not at_him - but next to him.

Popescu’s POV: Jonah - blackened and frightened looking -
stands over Matt - threatening or protecting? We cannot tell.

POPESCU
Yes. He’s here. Do you see him
Matt?

Matt nods weakly. He’s very ill.

SARA
I don't see anything.

POPESCU
Good. You're strong. Healthy. You
shouldn't see.

SARA
This is turning my world upside
down.

POPESCU

We live in a small corner of a vast
spiritual universe, the night sky
is not filled merely with the light
of dead stars...

(straight at Matt)
...-but with the active presence of
a Divine spirit. Faith is the
knowledge of things unseen. But
it’s also knowing - deep in your
heart - that even the worst
experiences of your life have
meaning and Divine purpose - and
having the courage to face them.

Suddenly - the GRINDING OF THE GEARS AND CLANGING CHAINS of
the elevator from up above. Popescu walks slowly - magnets
out front - towards the open elevator doors - through which
he can see the crematory oven.

POPESCU (CONT’D)
So that’s where you are trapped.
Don’t worry.

81.

POPESCU (CONT’D)
Whatever you have done we are not
here to punish you. That is not our
place. Only to free you. Like a
bird caught in a room---

Suddenly the open elevator near Popescu SMASHES down in front
of him, then suddenly lifts back up, faster than it should be
capable of - back up a floor - then SMASHES down again.

MATT
(weakly)
He doesn’t want to leave.

Matt looks bad. Paler. Less there. More like Popescu. One
foot in the grave. Popescu meanwhile can’t get at the oven.

POPESCU
There must be another way.

INT. SARA AND PETER’S BEDROOM —- CONTINUOUS 129

The children cower together on Sara’s bed - fingers in ears
from the noise of the elevator. And not just the elevator -
the whole house seems to be shaking. Huge pounding noises
coming from inside the walls.

EXT. THE HOUSE - A BEAT LATER 130

Sara follows Popescu as he feels his way with his hands along
the base of the house.

POPESCU
There has to be another way to
empty it.

Even outside you can hear the NOISE of the elevator - moving
up and down in the house... As Popescu makes his way around
the outside - searching with his hands. Then Popescu stops.

He’s found a small metal door about the size of a vent rusted
shut and over grown with the vine that grows on that side of
the house.

POPESCU
Help me.

His old hands aren’t strong enough. But with Sara’s help they
rip away the vine and pull the little door open.

POPESCU
He's here.

82.

Inside we see a small pile of dust, a portion of skull, and
other bone bits. Jonah’s remains.

INT. SARA AND PETER’S BEDROOM —- CONTINUOUS 129B

Wendy and the little ones huddle together on the bed as the
bedroom door swings open and shut SLAMMING each time as if of
its own accord. The whole house shakes with the BOOMING sound
of the elevator slamming again and again.

It feels like the entire house is about to collapse around
them - suddenly it’s too much and Mary begins to SCREAM

MARY
Make it stop! Make it stop!

EXT. THE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 130B

Popescu bows his head and murmurs a prayer for the dead in
Latin. As he does the elevator POUNDS TWICE AS LOUD, like it
was angrily and malevolently alive.

Starting to tremble, Popescu reaches behind him for his black
bag. And from within it pulls out a white silk prayer shawl.

Wiping his brow with the back of his shaking hand Popescu
gently sweeps Jonah’s last remains and folds them into the
silk. He murmurs a last prayer and as he does - the elevator
suddenly stops.

The shaking and pounding noises stop. The whole house is
suddenly still and quiet. Popescu has won the battle, but he
looks as though he won’t live though the night, he is spent.

INT. SARA AND PETER’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 129C
Deafening silence. Wendy and the little ones on the bed.
Cautiously take their fingers from their ears - and adjust to
the quiet. She looks around. Takes a breath. The place
undeniably feels different.
WENDY
I think...it’s over.

EXT. THE HOUSE - NIGHT 131

At his open car, Sara hands Popescu the silken bundle with
Jonah’s remains in it, and he puts them gently on the seat.
83.

SARA
Will Matt be alright now?

POPESCU
(haltingly)
The house should be quiet now and
at peace. But I must warn you...
sometimes for a day or so after a
spirit has been removed from a

house.... there are strange events -
like aftershocks from an earth-
quake. If anything.... happens,

don’t be alarmed. They will pass...
within a day or two at the most.

SARA

Thank you, thank you for

everything.
POPESCU

(wry)
I'd like to say it was my...
pleasure but...
Sara smiles, realizing she likes this old man, a lot.

SARA
Are you okay to drive?

Popescu gathers what’s left of his strength, and waves off
her concern.
132 INT. MATT’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 132

POPESCU O.S.
We’re all in God’s hands.

Matt’s whole body silently convulses. Tears flow down his
worn cheeks. He senses something and looks up and behind him -
at the high window which looks out at the street above.

In the window:

Jonah - OUTSIDE - he looks not scary - not angry - sad. He’s
shaking his head. Worried.

133 INT. NEW YORK HOUSE BASEMENT - LATE AFTERNOON 133

Home from work, a chagrined Peter cleans up the mess he made
the night when he was drunk down here and playing the guitar.
132B

134

84.

He puts the battered Fender guitar - once the repository of
his Big Dreams - back on its stand.

Sweeps broken glass and dirt into a can. And rights a fallen
shelf unit - replacing the old LPs and boxes of cassette
tapes that he knocked to the floor.

His eye catches on one of the tapes, labelled ‘Matt at Camp’.
He pulls out the tape and slots it into a dusty cassette
player and hits play. At first nothing - then the slightly
distorted wavery SOUND OF HIS SON’S VOICE - from eons ago -

MATT

(12 years old on tape)
---only 5 more sleeps till Parents’
Day. I can’t wait. I have a lot to
show you, Dad. You need to see how
I shoot the bow and arrow. And how
far I can swim. And they’re having
a Father and Sons race - it’s gonna
be great - I bet you and me beat
all the others.

(teasing)
If you do your job, of course.
Okay, I better go. Bye, dad.

Peter lets the sound of his innocent son’s voice wash over
him - as if washing all the fear and weakness out of him. He
wipes tears from his eyes.

INT. MATT’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 132B
In the darkness we can see Matt’s form - but not make out any
details. He wakes up with a low groan. As he rises in the dim
light we can see a bit better - he looks odd - something on
his face - he raised his hand - something covering his hand.
BACK UPSTAIRS: 134
Sara, Wendy and the Kids gathered in Sara’s room.
SARA
Whatever was here - is gone. We've
all had some bad nights, but it’s

over. And now we can get ba-

She’s interrupted by ROUGH RAGGED SCREAMING from downstairs.
85.

135 INT. MATT’S BEDROOM - A BEAT LATER 135
Sara runs in, finds Matt standing in the darkness screaming.

MATT
It hurts! Oh God it hurts!

She flips on the light and we see: Matt is completely covered
in Aickman’s inscriptions. Tiny lines of blood everywhere -

SARA
What have you done to yourself!?

MATT
I didn’t! I didn’t!

136 EXT. THE HOUSE - NIGHT 136

Sara stands anxiously at the door way of her house.
Illuminated by the flashing lights from the ambulance.

SARA
It’s okay, it’s okay. Everything’s
gonna be okay.

One paramedic opens the back door while another holds Matt
wrapped in a triage bandage-blanket already soaking through
with all the lines of blood - while a third injects him with
something to stop the pain and calm him down.

Peter pulls up and runs out of his car to Sara. As they’re
about to close the door, Matt turns and looks at his parents:

MATT
Doesn’t matter. Now that I’m out of
the house? It’1ll be after you.

The ambulance closes on Matt. He’s gone. Sara turns to Wendy -
SARA
We’ll be back as soon as we can.
And then we‘re getting out of here.
Sara finally acknowledges Peter’s presence.
PETER
Oh God Sara - I’m so sorry. If only
I’d been here -

Looking at him closely, Sara can tell Peter is sober and
resolved. That he made his choice.
137

138

139

140

86.

SARA
You’re here now. That’s what
counts.

She takes his hand and climbs in the car with Peter and they
take after the ambulance.

INT. AMBULANCE - CONTINUOUS 137

Matt zoning in and out of consciousness. Two paramedics
gently peeling back the blanket to look at his skin.

PARAMEDIC 1
How did he do that to himself?

See the sinuous lines of the weird engraved words but notice
they're not cut from the outside - but seem raised as if...
PARAMEDIC 2

I dunno it looks more like it was
scraped - from the inside out...

INT. SARA’S BEDROOM - LATER 138
Wendy looks in on the kids. They’re quiet, if traumatized.
Billy’s on the bed. Playing with the Krystal Ball. Mary holds
a doll, having a whispered conversation with it.

Wendy has a perfect apple in hand. She takes a bite - but
almost instantly chokes. The apple is completely rotten.

INT. THE KITCHEN - A BEAT LATER 139
Wendy runs into the kitchen - but as she enters is hit by a
wall of smell. She gags. Something horribly rotten - she
glances round the kitchen and sees:

The flowers which a little while ago were bright are now past
dead. The fruit bowl - at first looks fine - but literally
before her eyes the fruit decays into a festering pulp.

She opens the refrigerator. The light is off. It’s not cold.
Everything inside’s covered in mold. She slams the door.

INT. SARA AND PETER’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 140

Mary whispers with her doll. We hear only bits of it.
141

140B

142

87.

MARY
(to her doll)
Really? They’re all here?

Though she’s playing - there is nothing ‘playful’ about it -
Something eerie about her intense, one sided conversation.

INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 141

Between the door to that bedroom and the one to hers. See
into her bedroom. A pile of toys. Suddenly the pile stirs.
And we hear a little bell tinkle.

ANGLE ON:

A stuffed animal with a tiny bell round its neck - The
really worn and almost shapeless one with the shoe button eye
hanging by a string. Did it just move? Or was that just the
wind?

INT. SARA AND PETER’S BEDROOM 140B

Billy absorbed in his Krystal Ball. Staring into the little
window at the purple waters inside - seeking answers to
whispered questions. Mary looks up from her doll at the door
way - in time to see:

That worn old stuffed animal sits on the floor in front of
the door. She looks back down at her doll then hears the
tinkling bell. When she looks up, the stuffed animal is gone.

Mary gets up and goes to the door and looks down the hall.
There’s the little thing standing at the top of the stairs -
facing her - as if looking right at Mary whose eyes widen at
what seems to her wonderful magic.

Mary runs down the hall after it. Billy pays no attention -
too absorbed in his oracle.

INT. HALLWAY 142
Mary stands in the little hallway. Looks for the stuffed

animal. Can’t see it in either direction. But she hears the
little bell. Then she sees it at the bottom of the stairs.
143

144

145

146

147

88.

INT. DOWNSTAIRS - CONTINUOUS 143
Mary at the top of the stairs headed down to follow it.
Thinking what a wonderful game this is...

INT. THE BASEMENT STAIRS - A BEAT LATER 144
Mary gets to the stairs too late to see the doll - but she
can hear its bell disappearing into the darkness of what was
Matt’s bedroom, and is now more like the black hole of
Calcutta. Or just a black hole. The cave of all nightmares.
Mary hesitates but only for a second - then giggles nervously
and trundles down the stairs - and quickly disappears after
it into the darkness at the bottom of the stairs.

INT. THE KITCHEN 145
Wendy pulls the rotted food out of the fridge and shelves.
But it seems never ending. A first glance shows a normal loaf
of bread so she turns to the rotted tomatoes beside it. But
when she looks back at the bread it is now green with mold.
She nearly gags as she stuff the last of the reeking rotted
food into two bulging garbage bags.

INT. SARA AND PETER’S BEDROOM 146

Billy’s alone nervously playing with the Krystal Ball. He’s
clutching it fiercely. Eyes shut -

BILLY
Is Mattie gonna be alright?

He shakes the ball then looks intently -

ANGLE INSIDE THE KRYSTAL BALL: 147
From the liquid depths the oracle spins - and rises:

KRYSTAL BALL
“Never again”

Billy shakes it again - not wanting it to be true -

BILLY
Is he gonna die?
148

89.

KRYSTAL BALL
“The oracle has spoken”

He shakes it again. Determined to get the answer he wants.
FILL THE SCREEN:

With the little plastic window and the churning sea of fluid
beneath it as the plastic oracle comes spinning up towards us
filling the screen:

But the side that floats up doesn’t hold any of the
proverbial phrases. Instead it is covered in the strange
words and signs that we recognize as the ones Aickman carved
onto dead bodies:

Mortuum Suspiria Tenebrum
Billy’s startled and shakes it again and again - but now

every one of the twenty sides holds only words in that creepy
Necromantic language!

 

Billy hurls the ball across the room where it smashes leaving
purple dye streaming down the wall.

INT. POPESCU’S CAR - SAME TIME 148

He grips the steering wheel and squints against the glare of
on coming headlights which as he passes them pass over the
white silk bundle behind him on the back seat.

Popescu looks bad. Cold sweat. Having trouble focusing. And
as he does - images coming to him:

He’s blinking - and seeing the lights from opposing traffic
going by - and seeing eyes without eye-lids, and lids with
out any eyes - open and shut - open and shut.

POPESCU
Of course. Why didn’t I see? He
removed their eyelids. Not to
uncover their eyes. But to cover
ours... So that no one would ever
see that they were there...

Behind him - we hear a sound of rustling silk. Something
rises from the back seat... Popescu looks up in the rear view
mirror - his eyes transfixed by the sight:

The white silk begins to swirl and rise as if lifted from
within by some materializing thing -
90.

- Popescu staring into the rear view mirror doesn’t see that
he is drifting into the other lane into the oncoming traffic -

- He tears his eyes away from the mirror to see headlights
coming straight at him!

He swerves just in time off the road - plowing into a road
sign. The car comes to a halt. Popescu breathless but unhurt.

149 EXT. THE SIDE OF THE ROAD - CONTINUOUS 149

He looks back up into the rear view mirror and sees: JONAH in
the back seat!

Popescu slowly turns around - dreading what he will see in
the back seat - Jonah - looks back at him. Their eyes lock -
Popescu’s eyes widen - his mouth opens and we

CUT TO:

53C INT. PARLOUR - 1927 - NIGHT 53C
Right back where we were.

Jonah raises his head. He looks around in horror - the room
has changed - is still changing - the walls themselves have a
crumbly ectoplasmic appearance, bits of it crumble, revealing
cracks and holes through which we see not the outside - but
some infinite black space -

Jonah reels back and sees that he is the only one alive. The
sitters all lie on the floor in frozen dead rictus of terror.

He hears a GROAN. It's Aickman. He lies on the floor - he's
not quite dead. And he's trying to speak.

Jonah brings his face close to the dying man - can barely
hear what Aickman is saying from his hideously shredded lips -
just elusive fragments -

AICKMAN
Get out. They'll be after you now.

Jonah looks up just as the table where he had been sitting
begins shaking again - suddenly the shaking becomes wilder
and the table hurls itself straight at Jonah.

He rolls out of the way. Kneels on the floor - looks down and
for a second sees: the floor itself seems to be a sea of
angry dead faces trying to thrust up at him -

 

 
91.

He reels back and up to his feet - runs out of the room and
into the photo salon.

For a second all is quiet but then we hear WHISPERING and
MOANING - growing - and Jonah looks around at all the
funerary portraits on the walls:

In each photo - the dead seem to come alive their faces now
covered in Aickman's engravings - they SCREAM at Jonah from
within their frames -

Jonah runs for the front door but it SLAMS in his face. And
no amount of force will open it.

He turns and runs up the stairs followed by the sound of
BANGING as every door in the house swings open and slams shut
- open and shut - again and again - louder and LOUDER -
making it impossible for him to enter or exit any room -

Where can he go? Where can he hide from the madness all
around him?

We can't tell what is real and what may be his terrified mind
- but it seems that every part of the house has come alive -
and either physically threatens him - or seems itself to be
filled with angry accusing faces and hands -

And then he sees - one door open - not swinging open and shut
- just open. It's the elevator door. It seems dark and safe
and quiet in there - The shaking sobbing boy crawls into the
dark womb of the elevator.

And as he does - for a second the whole house goes quiet - no
sound except the heavy breathing and sobbing of Jonah.

Suddenly the metal elevator door slams shut. And with a
grinding groan we hear the elevator begin to descend.

Hear Jonah's pounding fists on the metal walls. And the
howling and wailing and pounding of the whole house resumes
as if an angry mob demanding satisfaction...

Down in the embalming room we stare at the closed door of the
furnace into which the elevator descends.

We can hear the thudding of Jonah pounding from within the
elevator as it descends and lands down here in the basement.

Suddenly -we see the lever of the furnace move by itself -
and we see the FLASH OF FLAME as the fire ignites in the
furnace and we hear Jonah's SCREAMS muffled yet deepened by
the enclosure of oven and elevator.
92.

And as the boy burns all other sounds fall away - everything
grows silent except the terrible muffled screams of the
burning boy.

UPSTAIRS - CONTINUOUS

As the boy downstairs dies - the room begins to return to
normal - the walls restore - the ectoplasmic sheen and smoke -
begins to dissipate - dissolve - into just smoke - which with
a blast of wind from nowhere - disappears - leaving only the
empty room - the overturned table - and the corpses of
Aickman and the five seance sitters.

150 EXT. ROADSIDE - NIGHT 150
Popescu sits in the car, tears stream from his eyes. He rolls
down the window and lets the wind blow open the silk and lift
a thousand particles that once were Jonah into the air.

151 INT. WENDY'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 151

The room is empty. But we can hear the shower running.

152 INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS 152

Wendy sobs in the shower trying to wash the rot reek off her.

153 EXT. SIDE OF THE ROAD - NIGHT 153
Popescu in a phone booth by the side of the road. The old man
is weak and has to hold himself up in the booth. He finishes
dialing a number - which rings and rings and rings...

154 INT. THE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 154

In the kitchen the phone rings. And rings.

152B INT. BATHROOM - SAME TIME 152B

As Wendy turns the shower off the curtain itself sways oddly -
moves with ripples like the wing of a manta ray -

-then suddenly - as if it were alive and possessed of a mind
of its own - the curtain wraps around Wendy -
93.

For a mad second it’s almost comic - as if she were just
tripped up in her shower curtain - but the wet white plastic
seals tighter and tighter around her - now thrusting itself
down her mouth when she opens it to scream - choking her -

155 INT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME 155

The answering machine sits on the counter beside a vase of
bright flowers. It finally kicks in -

ANSWERING MACHINE
You've reached the Campbells.
Please leave your message at the
beep.

156 EXT. SIDE OF THE ROAD - NIGHT 156
Popescu in the phone booth by the side of the turnpike.

POPESCU
(weak, halting)
I’ve made a terrible mistake. The
missing bodies - they’re there.
That was his amplifier; their
spirits. But it backfired. All

 

those souls in torment... The boy
wasn’t evil. His spirit... held
them all back. A finger... in the

dike. And I removed him. You must
get out, now!

152C INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS 152C
Wendy rips at the curtain - shredding it - tearing it - till
she’s free - gulping air on the cold tile floor.

157 INT. WENDY'S BEDROOM - A BEAT LATER 157
Wendy pulls clothes on when she hears SCREAMING and runs to
the window and looks down. She can’t see anything. But it
seems to be coming from outside.

158 EXT. THE HOUSE - A BEAT LATER 158
Wendy looks around. Where’s the scream? Hears it again - it’s
coming from the basement. She looks to the low windows that

look into Matt’s room and sees Mary standing on a table
pounding on the window.

INT. THE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 159

Wendy runs back in and tears down the stairs to Matt’s room.

INT. MATT’S BEDROOM - A BEAT LATER 160

She looks around the room - no sign of Mary - then she sees
her on the other side of the glass - screaming.

Wendy runs to the door - but it won’t open. She tries and
tries and tries - Billy runs in too - drawn by the screams.

Wendy looks around - for something - anything - finally she
grabs the little wooden chair by the table - motions Billy to
get back - and swings the chair with all her might at the
glass window and SHATTERS it into a million pieces.

WENDY
C’mon Mary - come to me!

Mary runs over - and Wendy reaches over the wood and picks
her up and lifts her into the bedroom. They turn to run from
the room and she looks back over her shoulder and sees the
Oven open - the little toy sitting at the edge of it - as if
laughing at her - and behind it - the flames shoot up!

Super: 2:15 a.m.

INT. PSYCH CELL - NIGHT 161

Matt sits in bed. Head nodding from sedatives. His skin has
cleared. No trace of the markings. But he’s in hell now, with
real demons. The OTHER PATIENT in his room frozen with the
thousand yard stare of heavy anti-psychotic meds.

Matt just covers his face with his hands. Then there’s a
strange SILENCE as a shadow falls over him - he looks up.

It’s JONAH, his head strangely tilted. Matt looks around.
Nobody else sees him.

DR. BROOKS (0.S.)
He’s sedated and comfortable.
INT. DR. BROOKS'S OFFICE - NIGHT 162

The Campbells look worried - but for the first time in a long
while they seem together. Peter’s holding her hand.
95.

DR. BROOKS
The markings are gone. The skin is
really an extension of the mind.
Just some kind of dermatitis.
Dermographia. Nothing dangerous.

They look relieved. But the Doctor looks grim.

DR. BROOKS (CONT’D)
But we ran his panels. I’m afraid
it’s not good news. The treatment
has frankly had no effect.
His cell count is worse than
before.

PETER
There must be something else, some
other treatment -

DR. BROOKS
I wish I could tell you there was.
I believe in fighting till you die.
But not fighting when you’re dead.
With these numbers I have no idea
what’s keeping him alive.

161B INT. PSYCH CELL - CONTINUOUS 161B

Jonah stands now before Matt. Matt’s cell mate stares - but
we can’t tell if he sees Jonah too or not.

We cannot tell what Jonah intends. Matt rises woozy. The two
boys approach each other - closer and closer...For a moment -
almost a mirror effect - as the two boys stand in front of
each other - once again - only Jonah’s intense GREEN EYES
distinguish them -

NEW ANGLE - MATT’S CELL MATE
suddenly squawks, for reasons unknown.
BACK ON MATT
he looks different - we can’t at first say how, maybe its the
slight tilt of his head now - then we notice - Jonah’s
intense green eyes peer out from Matt’s face...

DR. BROOKS (0.S.)

Given his state it might be best
for him just to stay here.

INT. DR. BROOKS’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 162B
Peter has to practically hold Sara from collapsing.

DR. BROOKS
But then again the choice is yours.
I can connect you with a hospice,
or if you think you can handle it -
bring him home.

PETER
How long do you think he has?

DR. BROOKS
There’s really no way of saying for
sure. He could go tonight. Or ina
week. Probably not more.

SARA
Can we see him?

DR. BROOKS
Of course.

INT. PSYCH CELL - A BEAT LATER 161C

Dr Brooks and Matt’s parents arrive at Matt’s door and when
they push it open, they find only the cell mate there.

He’s rocking on his bed. Mumbling to himself. We can barely
make it out...

PATIENT
(mumbling tunelessly)
‘One bright day in the middle of
the night. Two dead boys got up to
fight...’

Matt’s gone. Behind him the curtains flutter in the wide open
window - whose metal bars have been impossibly bent open...

Dr. Brooks grabs a phone from the wall to call security.

DR. BROOKS
(on phone)
He can’t have got far. He’s
literally dead on his feet.
97.

163 EXT. THE CEMETERY - NIGHT 163

For a boy who should already be dead, Matt/Jonah seems
strangely strong as he runs down the road by the cemetery,
the surrounding trees bent over in the heavy wind.

Super: 3:20 a.m.

A BANGING SOUND in the night. The garage door - smashed open -
bangs open and closed in the increasingly heavier wind.

164 INT. THE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 164

Wendy hears a slamming sound outside and looks out the window
and sees the garage door slamming in the wind.

165 INT. KITCHEN - A BEAT LATER 165

Wendy opens the back door. She sees the garage door swinging
in the wind, but in front of it now stands Matt/Jonah holding
an axe. She is stunned for a moment.

WENDY
Matt?

Matt just stares blankly at her - then starts running right
at_her - axe in hand...

She slams the door and throws the latch. With a sudden
splintering CRASH - The axe rips through the back door -
stopping just short of her face.

She turns to run, and sees a worried Mary standing right in
front of her. Wendy swoops her up and bolts down the corridor
to the front stairs. The axing noise continues behind her.
She puts Mary down.

WENDY
(whispers)
We’re going to be play hide and
seek now. I want you to hide
upstairs, okay? And don’t come out
no matter what, unless I say it’s
okay? You understand?

Mary nods and runs up the stairs.
Now Wendy sees Billy is cautiously moving through the parlor

to investigate the noise. She quietly slips over to him and
turns him around.
166

98.

Wendy gets him to follow her, but before she turns she
notices the axing has stopped. She looks towards the back
door.

Unseen behind her we see Matt silently (in bare feet)
charging towards her, axe raised!

Billy sees him and leaps away. Wendy spins and backs against
the wall.

WENDY
(tears of terror)
Matt. No.

Wendy stumbles and falls to the ground then Matt/Jonah brings
the rusted axe slicing down - straight into the pulpy wood
where Matt/Jonah had scratched the wall earlier in the movie.

He pulls the axe back ripping out chunks of wall revealing a
FACE.

Chop Chop. There is a body inside! Covered in Aickman’s
inscriptions and rags. It rolls out, still weighty and solid
as if it was freshly dead.

Wendy rolls aside as the body thumps to the ground where she
just was.

Matt/Jonah axes the wall again. Then uses the pick side of it
to pull floor boards open - and reveals right there:

BODIES. Bodies stacked side by side like cords of wood. Each
covered in Aickman’s necromantic engraving. Eyes staring wide
- because they have no eyelids.

Matt continues cutting and more bodies come tumbling out.

INT. DOWNSTAIRS - A BEAT LATER 166

The little kids are crying and Wendy’s pleading with
Matt/Jonah - He shoves them roughly out the door -

MATT / JONAH
Whatever you do - don’t let them
put out the fire.

WENDY
But what about you?

For just a second - within the blackened grim face shines a
glimpse of the old Matt - and an almost smile -

MATT / JONAH

Don’t worry. They can’t hurt me.

I’m already dead.
He slams the door. Then turns with grim purpose back towards
the parlor.
EXT. THE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 167
The kids beat at the door - calling to Matt. Wendy tries a
window. Locked.
EXT. CAR - NIGHT 168
In the car. Sara sobs and sobs. We can’t hear her. Just watch
her wracked body - and the O of her mouth as she moans.

INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS 169

She seems lost. Empty. The lowest we’ve seen her. Peter’s
turned a corner though. He takes her by the shoulders -

PETER
We'll find him.

SARA
And then what? He’s -

PETER
We'll face that then. If nothing
else let him die in our arms,
instead of in a hospital bed.
We'll find him. And bring him home.
INT. THE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 170

Matt/Jonah has barricaded the doors. Piling furniture and
anything that can move - in front of the doors.

From within we hear a pounding and ripping sound.

INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 171

He’s ripping at the walls with the axe. Splintering the wood.
Breaking it apart. And as he does - we see:

More corpses. Embalmed and perfectly preserved - and covered
in Aickman’s engraved spells.
172

173

100.

Twenty, thirty - more - they’re everywhere. Behind every wall
- beneath every floor board.

Everywhere he tears back the wall - there’s more dried -
engraved corpses.

The house is a living tomb - literally stuffed to the rafters
with all the bodies that have been stuffed in the place.

Jonah/Matt’s shaking hands finally succeed in lighting the
inside of the walls which begin to burn rapidly. Igniting

the dry corpses around them - filled with flammable embalming
chemicals - the bodies blaze like man-sized Duraflame logs.

EXT. THE HOUSE - PRE-DAWN 172

A police car pulls up as thick smoke pours off of the house
making it hard to see how much is burning.

Then Peter and Sara pull up. He runs out and tries to make
for the house. A cop puts a restraining arm on him -

COP
Let ‘em do their job. You’d only
endanger them and yourself.
Peter sees from out of the smoke.

BILLY (0.S.)
Mom! Dad!

Wendy leads he and Mary out of the smoke.

PETER
Where’s Matt?

WENDY

Inside.
INT. PARLOUR - CONTINUOUS 173
Matt/Jonah has torn the stuffing out of all the furniture and
is thrusting it in with the corpses. He’s in the dark heart
of the house now.
His hands are weak and shaking. And he keeps convulsing and
shifting between Jonah and Matt. As he mumbles to himself

sometimes in one voice and sometimes in another -

Behind him - the whole house seems to be shifting - changing.

The room itself - the entire interior is changing - almost as
if becoming that same rotted meat that Matt once saw it as.

The floor splinters and rots before our eyes as if it were
all turning into something else. Walls now crumbling fetid
flesh; squirming maggots, like termites, fill the ‘wood’.

Matt/Jonah hurries to light his match, to set the pyre ablaze
before it becomes something else. And lights it. And sets a
furious blaze growing back there.

Matt/Jonah tosses things from the room into the blaze. Grabs
the box filled with photos and eyelids - opens it - scoops
them out and flings them into the fire - all of them.

The photos curl and blacken in the flames. And the eye lids
all burn to dust - and as they do:

The room begins to fill with people - we recognize many of
their faces from the old photos we’ve seen of the dead - as
all the souls - trapped in all the bodies in all the walls
and floors of the house now appear flickering between all the

 

 

 

 

states from their death to their embalming and engraving.

 

They are everywhere: coming down stairs - stepping out of
walls - rising from the floor - all headed for Matt/Jonah.

EXT. THE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 174

Popescu’s old car arrives. The fireman are already there.
Popescu tries to calm Sara.

SARA
I don’t understand. You said it was
over!

POPESCU

Matt's trying to end it now...

INT. PARLOR —- CONTINUOUS 173B

Our sight of Matt/Jonah is lost a beat amidst the shifting
flickering forms that crowd now around him - and the growing
flames of the burning room - but when we do see him we see:

He is dying.

POPESCU (0.S.)

Trying to reach the heavens Aickman

created a hell of trapped souls.
(MORE )
102.

POPESCU (0.S.) (CONT'D)
Jonah felt responsible and he
waited all these years for someone
who might help him make it right -
someone who could free him - and
them. Someone like Matt...

In a room that seems at this instant to be made up of nearly
equal parts rotten meat and burning walls, crowded with
wailing ghosts pawing angrily all around him - his body is
wilting.

You can only run on dead man’s legs for so long.

174B EXT. THE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 174B
The weak older man is all that’s holding Sara up.

SARA
Matt. We’ve got to save him.

POPESCU
Pray with me. Pray with me now.

SARA
To who?

Fr. Popescu, not unfamiliar with Sara’s doubt, begins to
recite St. Michael's prayer anyway.

POPESCU (CONT’D)
Saint Michael the Archangel, defend
us in battle. Be our protection
against the wickedness and snares
of the devil...

The firemen knock the door away - and when Sara looks up for
a moment she can see straight into the parlor - where,
through the dust and the flames - she sees Matt/Jonah covered
in soot and smoke - She doesn’t see the things that crowd all
around him - only sees him - rigid as if frozen and covered
in burnt flesh and soot.

Peter starts to run into the house but gets tackled by a cop -
another cop comes and they both hold Peter down.

PETER
My Son’s in there for God's sake -
let me go!

For just an instant before he’s taken down he and Sara lock
eyes - He struggles harder - bringing more cops to wrestle
him to the ground - Which allows Sara to make a dash for the
house....
103.

Sara runs straight at and into the house - past startled
firemen and cops too slow to stop a determined mother as the
very ceiling begins to collapse.

175 INT. THE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 175

As Sara runs in, the house falls down around her. Behind her
a beam collapses, blocking the entrance she came through.
She’s now trapped there too. She ducks her way into the
parlor where she sees with her own eyes what is happening:

She sees the walls torn open and filled with burning tattooed
corpses. She sees through the flames - and as she begins to
choke on the fumes - and weaken - she sees more - sees all
the hideous shapes and forms around - sees her dying son
trapped alone in a burning room filled with death.

SARA
Matt!

She throws herself straight through flame at Matt/Jonah and
grabs hold of her boy and pulls him to the ground - just as
the ceiling comes down - the two fall on the safe side of it -
but are trapped in a burning corner - under ceiling that

can’t last much longer.

She’s holding her son and that’s all that matters as she
rolls with him on the floor.

She drags him beneath the table - just as more of the ceiling
collapses and covers them in debris.

She looks down at her boy - who is out - possibly dead - but
sees Jonah’s horribly charred face-

Suddenly his eyes open. And look up at her - the saddest
expression in the world.

At first she recoils in horror - this is not her son - this
burnt battered flesh is someone else and someone else’s son.

But something in her just sees a child.

SARA (CONT'D)
Here. I’m here. Momma’s here.

She brings her face down to his. Kissing the blackened skin.
Her tears spilling on his charred face. And when she looks
down at him - she can clearly see it is Matt’s face beneath
the ash.
104.

SARA
Oh Mattie. My Mattie.

More pieces of the ceiling collapse around them. They are
soon to be buried beneath burning beams. Sara looks around
frantically - for any way out - any chance of escape.

There is none.

She looks down at her son - his breathing grows lower and
lower. It seems he’s at the end.

She holds him to her and closes her eyes as fire and debris
rain down around them.

SARA
Our...our Father who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name. Thy Kingdom
come. Thy will be done. On earth as
it is in heaven.

A huge CRASHING sound - and she holds him tighter - thinking
this is it for both of them... Flames rise all around them...

SARA
...though I walk through the Valley
of the Shadow of Death...

A faint voice joins her...

MATT
(weakly)
I will fear no evil...

She looks down and sees Matt looking back at her.

SARA & MATT
...for Thou art with me...

Just then a chunk of the wall gives way and a huge spray of
water shoots in from the outside - forcing the flames back.

Arms suddenly grab both of them - It’s Peter and a fireman
who together pull them out to the air.

We are left for a second still in the burning room - and as
it completely fills with smoke and flame it seems we can hear
a faint voice continuing...

JONAH (0.S.)
-..and I shall dwell in the house
of the Lord for ever.

EXT. THE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 174C

As the hose blasts away the ash and char we see Matt - not
Matt/Jonah - just Matt. And he looks better than we have seen
him look so far. Eyes bright. Skin clear. He looks damn good.
Especially for a dead boy.

It’s impossible - no burns - no wounds - and no signs of
either the disease or the cure or anything he’s been through.
He looks practically pink and new as the day he was born.

Old Popescu sees this and falls to his knees in prayer.

And as all three of them reach the lawn they are mobbed with
joy by Wendy and the kids.

Peter then puts his arm around his son and they hug. Then
they look up at the pre-dawn sky, still full of stars.

PETER
They don’t look dead to me.

MATT
No. They got plenty of life left.
Millions of years of life.

Behind them - sections of the house collapse as the firemen
pour water at it.

The blasts of water and wind send debris churning out into
the street and into the gutters. And the water that pours
down the edge of the street carries odd horrifying bits of
the nightmare that reigned inside:

Skulls, charred bones, fragments of drawings and photographs
glowing with ash and a half burned stuffed animal, it’s
button-eye still hanging by a thread, all flow down the
gutter towards a storm drain sewer.
SARA (0.S.)

I don’t really care if people don’t

believe.
FADE OUT.
FADE IN:

That Documentary-style silhouette of Sara talking. 2B
106.

SARA (CONT'D)
I know what happened. The doctors
and nurses know. My family knows.
And my son’s alive. And well. And
that’s all that matters. They do
say the Lord works in mysterious
ways. But they never warn you just
how mysterious those ways really
are.

(straight to camera)
Consider yourself warned.

FADE TO BLACK AND...

ROLL SUPER:
Matt Campbell was found to be a
completely healthy, normal
teenager.

His cancer has never reappeared.
The case is recorded in Connecticut
hospital records as a rare case of
‘spontaneous remission.’

The Aickman house has been rebuilt,
restored, and resold. No subsequent
occupants have complained of any
disturbing manifestations.
