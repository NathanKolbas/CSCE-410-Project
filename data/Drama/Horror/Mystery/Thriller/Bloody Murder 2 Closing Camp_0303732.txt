BLOODY MURDER 2:

CLOSING CAMP
a screenplay by John R. Stevenson

FADE IN:

EXT. WOODS - DAY

WE SEE a girl standing in about a foot of snow. She
faces the woods. Her face is in awe. She pans the woods
up and down with her eyes. She steadily starts walking
further and further...and starts gaining a faster pace as
the epic-ness begins.

Once she's in the woods, it grows very dark. She looks
back for a moment...then back around to be struck in the
face by a bright light. It fades and she can see a man
standing on a small hill. She walks to him.

TRACY
Jason?

JASON
You shouldn't be here.

TRACY
Mom and Dad want you to come home
now.

JASON
I can't.

TRACY
Why?

JASON

He won't let me.
The boy starts to quiver. Tracy grows scared.
Blood begins to run from his mouth.

TRACY
No...no...no...

A chain saw rips through Jason's chest.
Tracy screams!
WE PAN BACK to reveal a masked man standing behind him,

holding the machine.
2.
Tracy still screams as her brother is being ripped up.

CUT TO:

INT. CABIN - DAY

WE SEE Tracy lying in bed...eyes wide open. She's
breathing heavy. She looks around, and then sits up.

She sees her roommate staring at her.

SOPHIE
Bad dream?

TRACY
Yeah.

SOPHIE
Same one?

TRACY

Yeah, Soph, same one.
Sophie drops her head...so does Tracy.

CUT TO:

EXT. CAMP - CONTINUOUS
WEE SEE sign that reads MAIN LODGE AND DINING.
Tracy and Sophie run past it in a hurry.

SOPHIE (V.O.)
We are going to be so late.

TRACY (V.O.)
I know.

Tracy gets up on the porch and gives her boyfriend, MIKE,
a hug.

The head counselor walks out, followed by another guy.

RICK
Alright everybody! Listen up. We
got a lot of work ahead of us over
the next few days so lock this
place down for the winter.

Two of the counselors hug each other.
RICK (CONT'D)
As I was saying. We got a lot of
work over the next few days so we

can lock this place down. So I
arranged for an extra set of
hands.

He puts his hand on a guy's shoulder.

RICK (CONT'D)
So I want to you meet James. He's
an old family friend.

JAMES
Hey everybody.

ELVIS
What's up, man?

Everyone says hey.

RICK
James is hitching his way to USC.
He's a got full scholarship no
less.

Everyone awes.

RICK (CONT'D)
I roped him into sticking around
for a couple days, helping us.
Let's get to it. Any volunteers
who want to pair up with James for
the day?

SOPHIE
Me. I will.

RICK
Okay. Nice to see your
enthusiasm, Sophie. Oh, one more
thing. We got some weather coming
in so if you want to grab some
extra blankets from the shed
tonight, go ahead.

RYAN
Who needs blankets?

RICK

Alright. Let's go everyone.
Let's go.

Everyone walks away except Ryan and Angela...they're
kissing.

RICK (CONT'D)

Ryan! Can I see you for a moment?
Did you put the wood chipper back
in the shed like I asked you to
last night?

RYAN
Shit.

RICK
I knew it.

RYAN

I'll take care of it right now.

RICK
No, it's too late. The rain last
night ruined the motor.

RYAN
I'm sorry. It won't happen again.

RICK
It's just like the leaf blower.

RYAN
The leaf blower wasn't my fault.

RICK
And the canoe paddles?

RYAN
Look! Why are you always on my
ass?

RICK
Because you're a screw-up.

RYAN
What'd you say?

RICK
You heard me. Look, I'm not
impressed by your macho bull shit
like your little girlfriend. I'm
going to say this one: your screw
ups are costing me a lot money and
I don't like it.

RYAN
So what are you going to do, Rick?
Are you going to fire me, with
only three days left?
Ryan walks away.

CUT TO:

EXT. TRAIL - CONTINUOUS

We see Mike and Tracy walking to us. Tracy is carrying
blankets.

TRACY
Ah, The trees are turning early
this year.

MIKE
Yeah. So much for our Indian
summer, huh?

TRACY

Yeah. It's kind of lonely here
without all of the kids.

MIKE
Do not tell me you miss them.

TRACY
It's sad. The end of summer and
everything.

The two help each other spread the blanket over a close
line.

TRACY (CONT'D)
Don't you miss them?

MIKE
Now that you bring it up.
(pointing)
Nah.
They laugh.
TRACY
Come on, mister tough guy. Now
you can't fool me. Inside you're

just a geat big softy.

MIKE
Actually, you know that kid with
the lazy eye? He kind of got to
me a little bit.

TRACY
They

EXT.

They

They

(laughing)
See. I knew it.

smile at each other.

CUT TO:

CAMPFIRE - NIGHT

RYAN (0.S.)
I'd like to propose a toast.

all come into frame.

RYAN (CONT'D)
To the end of camp.

all toast.

RYAN (CONT'D)

May we not have to clean up
another camper's puke for another
ten months.

ANGELA
Or Elvis'.

ELVIS
That shit is fucking nasty.

RYAN
And now that the little bastards
have gone home to their mommies
and daddies, we can turn our
thought to more adult pursuits.

Angela looks up at him.

RYAN (CONT'D)
So what's tonight's mischief?

ANGELA

How about a game...of
(cringes)
Bloody Murder?

RYAN
Great idea. Who's up for it?
Elvis...

ELVIS

Do I have to?
RYAN
Don't be a chicken shit, you're
it.

ELVIS
Who's being a chicken shit?

Everyone teases him.

ELVIS (CONT'D)
Fuck you, okay.

RYAN
How about you Mike? You up for
it?

MIKE

Yep, yep, yep, yep.

RYAN
Tracy?
TRACY
Actually. I think I'm going to
pass.
MIKE
Trace...
TRACY
It's fine. You guys have fun.
RYAN
Trace...
TRACY

Actually I'm really tired. I'm
just going to go to bed early.

MIKE
I thought we were gonna...

TRACY
Not tonight, I'm serious. You

guys have fun, okay?

She kisses Mike and leaves.

MIKE
Let me walk you back.

He leaves and follows her.

SOPHIE
Jesus. You guys are so
insensitive.

RYAN
What?
ELVIS
What?
SOPHIE
Don't play innocent. You know

exactly what you were doing. Mike
of all people should know better.

JAMES
I think I might have missed
something.

SOPHIE

Tracy's brother Jason disappeared
up here about five years ago.

JAMES
Disappeared?

SOPHIE
Well, there was a series of
murders that summer, and Jason's
body was never found. The locals
claim it was Trevor Moorehouse.

ELVIS
They claimed.

ANGELA
Exactly.

CUT TO:

EXT. CABIN - CONTINUOUS
We see Mike and Tracy walk up to Tracy's cabin.
MIKE

I'm sorry, Tracy, that was--that
was insensitive of me.

 

TRACY
It's okay. I'm fine--really

MIKE
I just wasn't really thinking.

TRACY
They kiss.

It's okay. I didn't even mean to
make a thing out of it.

MIKE
Why don't you and I hang here
while the others run around the
woods like idiots?

MIKE (CONT'D)
What do you say?

TRACY
Mike...

MIKE
What if I begged?

TRACY
Mike.

MIKE
What if I cried?

TRACY
Even if you cried.

MIKE

I'm sensing you're trying to tell
me no.

TRACY
Trust your senses.

MIKE
I've tried really hard to get
close to you this summer.

TRACY
Don't make a thing out of it.

MIKE
I'm just saying I've tried so hard
to be sensitive to your family
situation.
10.

TRACY
My family situation? Is that
really what you think of this?

MIKE
I didn't mean it to sound like
that.
TRACY
What did you mean?

MIKE
I can't get close to you. You put
up this front.

TRACY
I'm tired of being treated like
I've got six heads.

MIKE
Then you shouldn't have told us
about your brother.

TRACY
What are you saying?

MIKE
I'm just saying it's a little

confusing. You know, you either
want the attention or you don't.

TRACY
I don't think I want to talk about

this anymore.

She leaves and walks inside the cabin.

MIKE

Fine.

CUT TO:
EXT. CAMPFIRE - CONTINUOUS
Off in the distance.
ELVIS
(mumbling)

That's it. Ease up...

There's laughter.
11.

RYAN (0.S.)
Hey, you need a beer?

Mike walks up to the fire where everyone else is

RYAN (CONT'D)
Hey.

MIKE
Amen, brother.

ANGELA
Got back kind of quick.

RYAN
Looks like somebody's not getting
any tonight.

MIKE
Yeah. What else is new, man?

RYAN
James has been asking about Trevor
Moorehouse.

MIKE
Fuck him. That guy's putting a
serious dent in my sex life.

JAMES
Who was he?

MIKE
Somebody else tell that story.

RYAN
Trevor was the son of the meanest
camp director that Placid Pines
has ever seen. He had this habit
of ratting on the counselors to
his old man. Well, one
year...several of the counselors
got this half-assed plan to get
back at them. But things got out
of control, and before they knew
it, Trevor was at the bottom of a
ravine half dead with his face
eaten by hungry birds.

JAMES
What happened to him?

RYAN

Well, naturally...
12.

JAMES
Naturally, he went to the
hospital. Medical at first, then
mental. His face was so badly
disfigured that he always wore a
mask.

RYAN
Yeah, how did you know?
JAMES
Every summer camp has a Trevor
Moorehouse. Here, let me see. At
some point he was either released,
or he broke out of the mental
hospital. Then it's said that he
returned to Camp Placid Pines to
forever seek out his revenge on
the place and the people...that
did this to him. How'd I do?

RYAN
Smart ass.

JAMES
Set up the new guy, huh? Nice
try, boys. Trevor Moorehouse is
just some fictitious local
psychopath to get campers into bed
at night.

RYAN
Fictitious local psychopath?

JAMES
Did you really think I'd be stupid
enough to fall for that?

RYAN
You think I'm making it up?

JAMES
I hope not. I would think you'd
be able to come up with something
a little better than the old
â€œpsychopath in the woods" story.

RYAN
Well then, tough guy. Since
you've got nothing to fear you
won't mind being "It."

They all laugh.
13.

RYAN (CONT'D)
Okay sports fans. It's time for a
little game of --

Angela jumps up to Ryan, hugging.

ANGELA
Bloody Murder.

RYAN
Angela, do the honors.
He hands her a blindfold.

ANGELA
Of course.

She walks over to James with it.

JAMES
Wait a minute. I didn't say
anything --

RYAN

What's the matter, Jimbo? Huh?
You having a little change of
heart?

ANGELA
Scared?

RYAN
You afraid Trevor might break up
the game?

JAMES
No. I just don't feel --

RYAN
Good! Then let the pretty lady
blindfold you. Remember...there's
nothing to fear.

JAMES
But fear itself.

RYAN
Let the games begin.

CUT TO:
14.

EXT. WOODS - CONTINUOUS

The group walks to a big tree in the middle of the woods.
James is blindfolded.

RYAN
You've got to count to 20 before
you can remove the blindfold.

JAMES
Okay.
RYAN
Everybody ready?

ANGELA
Yeah!

RYAN
Go!

The group runs off to hide.

JAMES
One-one thousand. Two-one
thousand. Three-one thousand.
Four-one thousand. Five-one
thousand...eighteen-one thousand.
Nineteen-one thousand. Twenty-one
thousand.

He turns around and removes the blindfold. He looks
around. Nothing.

JAMES (CONT'D)
Oh, man. Me and my big mouth.

James walks off to search for the rest of the group.
Each of the people are hiding in a different location.
James backs up into a tree and gasps.
ELVIS
(peeking through
trees)
You're not in Compton anymore.

James sees Mike gagging by a tree, back to him.
Mike turns around. His neck is bloody as he holds it.

He spits up blood. James begins to back up.
15.

MIKE
Oh-oh-oh!

James turns around in horror. There's a hockey-masked
figure with an axe coming up behind James.

JAMES
Trevor -- Trevor Moorehouse!

He screams as the masked man yells with the axe in the
air.

The yelling turns into laughter.
Mike is okay, and the man removes his mask. It is Ryan.

RYAN
(laughing)

You were saying something about

fictitious local psychopaths?

MIKE
We got him.
RYAN
Amen, brother.
ELVIS

What's going on?

RYAN
We're just having a little fun at
James' expense.

ANGELA
Tell him about the psychopath,
then they come out dressed --
that's hot, baby.

RYAN
That was beautiful with the blood.

MIKE
Thank you. Thank you very much.

RYAN
(pretend crying)

Trevor Moorehouse! Oh my God!

JAMES
Rick was right about you.

James begins to walk away.
16.
RYAN

Yeah, well, what's that?!

JAMES
You are an asshole.

RYAN
What did you say?

JAMES
I said you're an asshole.

Ryan tackles James to the ground.

Ryan falls first though.
JAMES (CONT'D)
Come on, man.

RYAN
Fuck.

ANGELA
Break it up, guys!

They restrain Ryan.

RYAN
You're dead, you little fucker!
Don't fuck with me! Fuck you,
bitch.
JAMES
(pointing)

Get your little friend out of here
before he gets hurt.

MIKE
Easy!

They all runs back to the cabin except for James and
Sophie.

SOPHIE
You okay?

JAMES
Yeah. He's not the first asshole
I've had to deal with. He
certainly won't be the last.

SOPHIE
I'm gonna head back up, but I'll
see you in the morning.
17.

JAMES
Yeah, if I decide to stay.

SOPHIE
Don't let that loser get to you.

JAMES
We'll see.

SOPHIE
Good night.

JAMES

Good night.
Sophie walks back to the camp.

EXT. CAMPFIRE - LATER

James sits there by himself.
