HEREDITARY

INT. WORKSHOP - MORNING 1

An impressive room serving as an ARTIST’S WORKSHOP. It’s
empty, but evidence of frantic creative activity abounds.

We PAN across the wall, crossing a series of meticulously
hand-crafted DOLLHOUSES, mostly works in progress. As we
drift past these unfinished dioramas, our trajectory becomes
clearer...

We are moving in on an extraordinary sculpture of a
beautiful, rustic CRAFTSMAN HOME, at 1:8 scale. Its front
wall has been removed, exposing its rooms in graphic
tableaux. This huge miniature is painstakingly detailed. It’s
adorned with shrunken props/decorations (flashlights, pill
bottles, shoes, etc.) and teensy furniture, all flawlessly
rendered and distinguishable ONLY IN SIZE from their full-
scale models.

We continue to pan/track across the miniature, edging CLOSER
AND CLOSER as we drift along its tiny rooms. We finally
arrive at a miniature replica of a TEENAGE BOY’S BEDROOM on
the second floor.

We push towards this until the ROOM FILLS THE FRAME. The
bright morning sun beams in through its window. It becomes
apparent that a handsome, skinny BOY is sleeping in the bed.
This is PETER GRAHAM (17).

We continue pushing gently in, remaining in a wide of the
room (whose status as a miniature has now been confused). The
door opens and STEVE GRAHAM (47) - tall, broad-shouldered,
formal - pops his head in. He wears a black suit.

STEVE
All right, Petey. Wake up time.

Peter stirs awake. Steve drops a folded-up BLACK SUIT AND TIE
on the foot of the bed.

STEVE (CONT'D)
Here’s your suit.

MAX, the family’s golden retriever, shuffles happily in
through the door.

STEVE (CONT'D)
Did your sister sleep in her room
last night?

EXT. GRAHAM HOUSE - SAME TIME 2
Wide on the house, revealing that it is IDENTICAL to the

miniature that we saw in the workshop. The surrounding
landscape is blanketed with SNOW.
Green Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 2.

Steve exits a back door to approach a very large TREEHOUSE.
It is joined to a sturdy oak and hovers fifteen feet above
the ground. We are subtly BOOMING DOWN from this wide view
(as Steve begins to climb the tree) to arrive at a parked CAR
- one of two family cars - in the foreground.

Sitting in the passenger seat is a bereaved woman (45). She
wears all black, and is beautiful in a worn way. This is
ANNIE GRAHAM, and she looks emotionally exhausted.

She wears a delicate NECKLACE bearing an ORNATE SIGIL, which
she compulsively fingers.

EXT. TREEHOUSE - SAME TIME 3
Steve pokes his head into the treehouse, where he finds:
CHARLIE - a plump, androgynous fourteen year old girl - lying
asleep on the floor. She wears a parka and pajama bottoms.
Beside her is a DRAWING PAD and an open SHOEBOX.

STEVE
Oh my God, Charlie. Are you crazy?

Charlie wakes up, her nose pink and runny. When she notices
Steve, she frantically reaches to SHUT the shoebox.

STEVE (CONT'D)
This is how you get pneumonia!

CHARLIE
(getting up)
It’s okay.
STEVE

Your mom’s in the car already,
we're late.

INT. FUNERAL HOME - CHAPEL - MORNING 4

A moderately attended FUNERAL. (A large group of MEN AND
WOMEN observe from the back.)

Before the altar, an OPEN CASKET rests beside a blown up
photo of the deceased ELLEN LEIGH, Annie’s 75 year old
mother.

Annie, Steve, Charlie (now wearing an oversized black dress
over her pajama bottoms) and Peter sit in the first row of
chairs. They listen as a LARGE WOMAN (60s) speaks in
remembrance of Ellen.

LARGE WOMAN
Ellen was a tough one. She didn't
mince words, she abhorred the
sentimental, and she was honest.
And I know that's how she raised
her children, Annie and Charles -
(MORE )
Green Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 3.

LARGE WOMAN (CONT'D)
(uncomfortably)
- may he rest in peace... To always
be honest...

Half-listening (half-wincing), Annie’s attention is drawn to
CHARLIE, who makes a quiet CLICKING noise with her tongue.
This is a tic.

Suddenly, a bird FLAPS out from the rafters, startling the
congregation.

The bird settles on a ceiling perch. It is a WHIPPOORWILL. It
looks down, fixing its gaze on Annie. Annie looks very
disturbed. Off-screen, the Large Woman continues.

MINUTES LATER
Annie is now on the PLATFORM.

ANNIE
I just wanna say first...it’s very
heartening to see so many strange
new faces here today. I know my mom
would be very touched (and probably
a little suspicious) if she could
see this turn-out, so...

Annie looks down to now read from a heavily edited loose-leaf
page. This is her eulogy. (Not used to reading in public, she
rarely looks up from the paper.)

ANNIE (CONT'D)
My mother was an intensely
secretive and private woman. She
had private rituals, private
friends, private anxieties... It
honestly feels like a betrayal just
to be standing here talking about
her...

Annie pauses. She looks at the paragraph. It’s very long, and
begins with the sentence “My mother was a chameleon." She
decides to skip ahead to the next paragraph.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
She was a very difficult woman to
read. If you ever thought you knew
what was going on with her - and
God forbid you tried to confront
that.../
(stops...pauses...skips
ahead)
...But when her life was
unpolluted, she could easily be the
sweetest, warmest, most loving
person in the world...
Green Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 4.

Charlie is DRAWING a weepy caricature of Annie at the
platform. Steve watches this in the corner of his eye.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
(pauses, skips again to
the next paragraph)
.-.-She was also incredibly
stubborn. Which maybe explains me.

Scattered, knowing laughter.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
You could always count on her to
always have the answer....

She stops short, eyes on the paper. The sentence would
continue “and if she ever WAS mistaken - well, that was YOUR
opinion and you were WRONG.”

Suddenly remorseful, Annie (off-book) asserts:

ANNIE (CONT'D)
I did love her.

Charlie is still drawing. Steve closes the notepad. He points
to Annie: “Listen to your mother." Charlie grudgingly
obliges.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
She was especially strong about
food. When I was a girl and I had
to eat my veggies...

LATER

The mourners have been invited up to view the deceased and
say goodbye. Organ music plays as Annie, Steve, Peter (who
doesn’t look) and Charlie shuffle by.

Charlie peers into the open casket to see her grandmother's
CORPSE. It wears a NECKLACE with a delicate SIGIL ORNAMENT
(identical to Annie’s). The seams in the corpse’s make-up are
eerily apparent and the lips are slightly twisted.

Unnerved, Charlie looks away. She meets eyes with a smiling
MIDDLE-AGED BLONDE MAN standing in the queue behind her. He’s
STARING at her - an overly sentimental look in his eyes.
Disturbed, Charlie averts her eyes. “Yeesh."”

SECONDS LATER

An older WOMAN arrives at the open casket. Her finger is
dipped into a small bottle of OIL. She quickly and covertly
STREAKS the oil along the corpse’s lips.

Seeing this, a following mourner squints with bewilderment.
Green Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 5.

INT. CAR (MOVING) - LATE AFTERNOON 5

Steve is at the wheel, driving back home. Annie sits
passenger, and Peter and Charlie sit in the back. They drive
past a gathering of DEER.

ANNIE
(to Steve)
How did you keep from screaming
during Judy’s speech?

STEVE
Ha. Well, if you could...!

Peter EYES the back of Annie’s head. She seems to grate on
his nerves. Meanwhile, Charlie is back to making clicking
noises with her tongue. She does this while unwrapping a
CHOCOLATE BAR.

ANNIE
(to Steve)
How about that bird flying in?

STEVE
Yeah, that was weird.

ANNIE
That was too weird. The timing? It
felt like it was my mom.

Steve nods, betraying a look of CONCERN. Annie self-
consciously backtracks:

ANNIE (CONT'D)
Not actually, obviously. Just - it
struck me.

Annie notices Charlie eating the chocolate bar.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
Hey! Are there nuts in that?

CHARLIE
No!

ANNIE
Better not be.

Annie returns her attention to the road. Steve lovingly takes
her hand. She smiles at him.

Charlie, irritated, looks very tense.

CHARLIE
(quietly)
I don’t like going back without
grandma.
STEVE
(carefully)
Well, sweetie...do you understand
why we have to?

 

Charlie just tenses up, eyes narrowing onto the floor.
INT. GRAHAM HOUSE - FOYER - EVENING 6
The house is unlit and seemingly vacant.

Off-screen, we hear FEET SCURRYING and a DOOR CLOSING. Max,
the golden retriever, BARKS in reaction to this.

A moment later, the front door opens and the Graham family
enters. They stamp the snow off their boots and remove their
coats.

Max runs up, desperate to greet them. Steve bends down to
happily receive him.

Charlie moves toward the stairs, still wearing her boots.

STEVE
Hey hey -- shoes off.

Charlie pulls off her boots. She and Peter start separately
up the stairs. Steve, looking down, notices dried FOOT-PRINTS
around the foyer.

STEVE (CONT'D)
(calling out)

See? What’s with all these

footprints? I’m tired of reminding

everybody.

INT. WORKSHOP - EVENING 7

Annie is at her work desk. It’s a mess of paints, props, wood
pieces, etc. She wears magnifying eye-glasses as she
carefully paints eyes onto a SMALL DOCTOR FIGURINE for a
MINIATURE HOSPICE. A figurine of an old woman - presumably
Annie’s mother - lies in a miniature hospital bed.

Steve enters, disrupting Annie’s focus.

STEVE
How's it going?

ANNIE
Just working.

Steve casually rests a glass of water and a PILL on the
table. She downs it without question.

STEVE
Still toiling on the hospice?
Green Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 7.

ANNIE
Between that and the pre-school.

There is a half-finished MINIATURE PRE-SCHOOL in the corner.

STEVE
How far are we now? Seven months?

ANNIE
Six and a half.

STEVE
Yow. Comin’ up.

Her eyes widen with stress.

STEVE (CONT'D)
Any title ideas yet?

Annie grabs her laptop and pulls up a PDF for a poster
promoting an upcoming EXHIBITION of her artwork. It features
a photo of a magnificent living room miniature. Below this
are the words “TITLE HERE” in bold, followed by “The Work of
Annie Leigh.”

ANNIE STEVE (CONT'D)
This is the photo they wanna
use. Ooh, I love that one.

ANNIE
The gallery owner keeps suggesting
Your Life in Miniature for the
title.

STEVE
What do you think of that?

Annie looks at him, incredulous. “Are you serious?”

STEVE (CONT'D)
No good?

ANNIE
It’s horrible!

STEVE
(conceding)
Yeah. A little trite.

ANNIE
A lot trite! Are you kidding? She
won't stop suggesting it!

Steve looks to a stack of LARGE MOVING BOXES in the corner.
They're marked “Mom’s Things” in Annie’s handwriting.
Green Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 8.

STEVE
You want me to put that stuff in
the attic?

ANNIE

...-Yeah. Maybe not just yet.
INT. PETER’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 8
Peter sits up in bed, holding a guitar. He improvises a
clunky tune as a muted TV plays cartoons. His eyes are onthe
TV.

The door cracks open and Steve pokes his head in.

STEVE
Goodnight, kiddo.

PETER
‘Night, dad.

STEVE

..-What you playing?

PETER
Just plucking random strings.

STEVE
(nods, then)
You feeling okay about everything?

PETER
(shrugs )
Yeah. Fine.
STEVE

Little sad?
Peter shrugs again. He clearly wasn’t fond of Ellen.

STEVE (CONT'D)
Yeah. I know.
(pause)
Okay, buddy. Love you.

Steve KISSES in Peter’s direction. Peter kisses back. Steve
walks off, leaving the door open.

A moment later, Annie walks up to the doorway, still wearing
her magnifying eye-glasses. She’s holding a prop in one hand,
a fine paintbrush in the other.

ANNIE
‘Night sweetheart.

PETER
Goodnight. I’m sorry about your mom.
Green Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 9.

ANNIE
(pause)
Thank you. I’m sorry about your
grandma.

PETER
..-Thank you.

Annie smiles, hesitates, and walks off. There’s a very loaded
tension between these two.

After Annie is gone, Peter climbs out of bed to shut the
door. He LOCKS it.

INT. CHARLIE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 9

Charlie’s room is that of a young artist. The walls are
covered in drawings, and the desks and other surfaces are
littered with different HANDMADE HUMAN MANIKINS and SMALL
STATUES (all made of disparate parts - mostly found objects).

Annie sits on the edge of Charlie’s bed. Charlie is under the
covers. Annie has opened Charlie’s drawing pad to see a
CARICATURE of Annie’s mother’s corpse in its casket.

ANNIE
That’s grandma?

CHARLIE
I dunno.

ANNIE

You know you were her favorite?

CHARLIE
(looking away)
No I wasn’t.

ANNIE
(pouncing)
Oh yes you absolutely were! Even when
you were a little baby, she wouldn't
let me feed you because she needed to
feed you. It drove me crazy.

CHARLIE
She said I was supposed to be a boy.

Annie knows this. She hesitates, wanting to say the right
thing.

ANNIE
How do you feel about that?

Charlie shrugs.
Green Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 10.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
You know I was a tomboy growing up?
I hated dresses and dolls and pink.

Charlie’s heard this before. She has tensed up.

CHARLIE
(looking away, quietly)
Who’s gonna take care of me?

ANNIE
(mock offended)
Ummm, excuse me? You don’t think
I’m gonna take care of you?!

CHARLIE
But when you die...
ANNIE
..+.-Then dad will take care of you.

Or Peter.

Charlie’s head remains turned. Discouraged, Annie turns back
the page of the drawing pad. She now sees the caricature of
her, crying at the pulpit.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
Who's this one?

No answer. Annie takes it personally, but pretends not to.
She closes the book with a smile.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
You never even cried as a baby -
you know that? Not even when you
were born.

Charlie ignores this.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
Did you feel like you wanted to cry
today?

Without looking at Annie, Charlie shrugs a tense “I don’t
know.”

ANNIE (CONT'D)
Do you think that might feel like a
relief?

Charlie remains miles away.

Annie looks up to notice that a difficult-to-read WORD (looks
like “Satony”) has been CARVED into the wall behind Charlie's
bed. Annie pauses, lets it go, and then bends down to KISS
Charlie’s forehead.

Green Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 11.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
Goodnight, sweetie.

INT. WORKSHOP - NIGHT 10
Annie enters. Outside the window: peaceful snowfall.

Annie hesitates before walking over to the box labeled “Mom’s
Things." She reluctantly opens it...

The box is filled with bottled oils and herbs. At the top of
the box is a PHOTO ALBUM titled “Memories.” Annie opens it to
sift through photos of her mother. She lays the album back
into the box, and then notices a stack of worn HARDBACKS. She
pulls one out. “NOTES ON SPIRITUALISM.”

This calls back unwelcome memories. Annie dumps the book back
into the box, and PUSHES the box away.

Annie walks to the door and flips off the light, leaving the
room in darkness (save for the moonlight). She’s about to
leave, but something makes her FREEZE.

Standing motionless in a dark corner (almost too dark to make
out) is ANNIE’S MOTHER, ELLEN - wearing the same outfit as
the funeral. She’s staring at Annie. SMILING.

Annie, nearly paralyzed with fear, reaches for the light
switch. Without looking away, she turns the light back ON.

Her mother is gone.
Annie remains motionless.

ANNIE
(a whisper)
Mom?

Annie's eyes are now drawn to...

A dusty older MINIATURE in the corner. It's a replica of
Annie's bedroom. A figurine of Annie (in her early thirties)
BREASTFEEDS a baby. Standing beside her is a figurine of an
OLDER WOMAN (Annie’s mother) holding her naked BREAST out of
her nightgown. She leans over, offering it to the baby.
Competing with Annie.

Troubled by this, Annie walks briskly to the miniature and
TURNS it away. It’s now facing the wall as Annie returns to
the door, flicks off the light, and leaves.
INT. ANNIE & STEVE’S BEDROOM - MINUTES LATER 11
Annie climbs into bed with Steve.

ANNIE

I just scared myself in the
workshop.
Green Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 12.
STEVE
Oh no. With what?

Annie pauses. Thinks about telling him. Steve looks
interested/slightly worried. Annie thinks better of it.

STEVE (CONT'D)
. No?

She smiles “nah.”

ANNIE
Goodnight.
Annie turns off the bedside lamp and gives Steve a blunt
kiss.
STEVE
(before she can pull

away )
Mm, mm - no you don’t.

He EXTENDS the kiss, making it last. Then:

STEVE (CONT'D)
Goodnight.

12 INT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM - NEXT MORNING 12
Charlie’s “special needs” class.

Scrawled on the blackboard are the words “Quiet means
Silence!” and all the students are indeed silent as they take
a quiz.

The TEACHER (40s) walks along the rows of desks, overlooking
the quiz-takers. He comes to CHARLIE, whose quiz is upside-
down. In her lap, she is assembling a small manikin’s body
with disparate found objects (wood, metal, cardboard, etc).

TEACHER CHARLIE
Are you done? (looking up, startled)
What?
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
.--Almost.
TEACHER
(warmly)

So maybe we finish the toy after
the quiz? What do you think?

CHARLIE
...Okay.

The teacher gently turns the quiz right-side-up. Charlie is
extremely tense through this.
13

13.

Suddenly a PIGEON flies into the window, slamming its head.
The impact breaks its neck.

The classroom erupts with excitement - “Oh my God!” “Did you
see that?!” - but not Charlie. She stares tensely at her
desk, still disturbed by the teacher's interference.

Charlie’s EYES scan up. They alight on a pair of SCISSORS on
the Teacher’s desk.

INT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY 13
Peter’s English class. The chalkboard reads:

Themes

- Escaping Fate.

- Relationship between knowledge and responsibility.
- "No man considered fortunate until he is dead."

The teacher, MR. DAVIES (30s), tries to facilitate a group
discussion. He holds a copy of Sophocles’ The Women of
Trachis.

MR. DAVIES
So if we're going by the rule that
a hero is undone by his fatal flaw,
what was Heracles’ flaw?

SMART-ASS STUDENT
Fucking his mom.

Some laughter from the class.
MR. DAVIES
Wrong play, Sam. And watch your
language.
Meanwhile, Peter is being hypnotized by BRIDGET (17), the
attractive girl sitting in front of him. Peter’s rapt
attention is glued to the butt of her jeans.
MR. DAVIES (CONT'D)
Come on, guys: What was Heracles’
flaw?
Bridget now speaks up:

BRIDGET
Arrogance.

This piques Peter’s interest.

MR. DAVIES
Okay - why?
Green Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 14.

BRIDGET
Because he literally refuses to
look at all the signs that are
being literally handed to him the
entire play.

Peter’s in love.

MR. DAVIES
Okay, interesting! So he thinks he
has control.

SMART-ASS STUDENT
Plus he fucked his mom.

More laughs.

MR. DAVIES

(to the smart-ass)
That’s two strikes, Sam.

(back to the class)
But also, don’t forget: Sophocles
writes it so the oracle is
unconditional. Meaning Heracles
never had any choice. Right?

Peter’s smartphone VIBRATES with a text.

MR. DAVIES (CONT'D)
So, does this make it more tragic
or less tragic than if he did have
a choice?

STUDENT #2
Less!

Peter checks his text. It’s from Brendan. It reads: “Wanna
smoke a bowl at break?” This came from the BOY behind him.

MR. DAVIES
Okay: Why?
STUDENT #2
(already giving up)
Because!

Mr. Davies turns to Peter, who’s now composing a text in his
lap.

MR. DAVIES
Care to weigh in, Peter?

Peter looks up, a deer in headlights.

PETER
About which part?
14

Green Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 15.

MR. DAVIES
Is it more tragic if it’s
inevitable than if the characters
had agency?

Peter is not following.

PETER
Yes?

MR. DAVIES
Why?

PETER

.-.-Because he had sex with his mom?

Dead air. Mr. Davies gives Peter an unencouraging look.
Another student picks up the slack:

STUDENT #3
I think it's more tragic - because
if it’s all just inevitable, that
means the characters have no hope
and that they never had hope,
because they’re just like pawns in
this horrible, hopeless machine.

Peter has now noticed BRIDGET looking at him. She gives him a
sardonic “nice try” smile. Peter smiles back, embarrassed.
She turns away. Peter’s smile turns to a longing stare.

EXT. SCHOOLYARD - DAY 14
Recess.

The DEAD PIGEON lies pathetically in the bushes below
Charlie’s classroom window.

Charlie stands nearby, staring at the pigeon. After some
time, she fishes a pair of SCISSORS from her parka pocket.
(These are the scissors from her teacher's desk.)

Charlie extends the scissors, fits the blades around the
pigeon’s neck, and SNIPS OFF ITS HEAD.

Charlie quickly POCKETS the pigeon head, and looks up to
notice:

An OLDER WOMAN (60s) sitting on a bench, just beyond the
schoolyard fence. She is gazing at Charlie, sentimental.

Charlie gawks at the woman, unnerved. Without breaking eye
contact, she pulls a chocolate bar from her pocket.

In the b.g., PETER walks past, joined by Brendan. Seeing the
chocolate, Peter casually asserts:
15

16

17

Green Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 16.

PETER
No nuts, Charlie.

This makes Charlie freeze up with tension.

INT. PSYCHIATRIST’S OFFICE - AFTERNOON 15
Steve’s office is large and sparsely decorated.

Steve sits in a leather chair with a notepad resting on his
lap. Sitting opposite him is an extremely agitated, depressed

female PATIENT (40s). Steve studies her non-judgmentally.

STEVE
And how’s the anger?

PATIENT
Same. I just don’t care as much.

STEVE
(optimistic)
So not as consuming?

PATIENT
(gritted teeth)
It's just as consuming, I just
don’t care as much.
Steve, stifling frustration, affects superhuman patience.
STEVE
And how’s your appetite been? With
the Serafem...versus the Lexapro.
INT. ANNIE’S WORKSHOP - DAY 16

Annie's laptop is open to a website: “Discernment of Presumed
Apparitions.”

Annie, sitting at the Graham house model, is carefully
painting a MINIATURE LAPTOP, featuring the very same website.

INT. ANNIE’S MOTHER’S BEDROOM - DAY 17
We are looking through the open door into the HALL.
Downstairs, the front door is heard opening.

STEVE (0.S.)
Hello!

ANNIE (0.S.)
Hi!

Annie steps out into the hall and walks past the doorway. A
moment later, we hear her footsteps FREEZE. She soon returns
into view, now looking very unsettled. She stares past us,
into the room...
18

19

Green Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 17.

ANNIE’S POV: The room is mostly EMPTY, save for the bed
(stripped of sheets), a bookshelf, and various FRAMED PHOTOS
featuring members of the family. One photo: a portrait of
Annie and her mother, standing side by side. There is also a
LARGE TRIANGLE (pointed northwest) that has been CARVED
violently into the floorboards.

Annie doesn’t react to the triangle. It was clearly already
there.

Annie leaves.
INT. TV ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 18

Steve sits on the couch, having just turned on the news. He's
still wearing his coat.

Annie enters.

ANNIE

Were you in my mom’s room?
STEVE

What? No.
ANNIE

The door was open.
Steve makes a “hmm” face.

The front door is heard opening, and Annie goes to the FOYER,
where Peter and Charlie are entering.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
Hey guys. How was school?

PETER
Okay.

ANNIE
Did either of you go into Grandma's
room recently?
They both squint. “Why would we go in there?”
PETER
I don’t think you need to worry
about me ever being in that room.
INT. HALLWAY - EVENING 19

Steve is at Annie’s Mother’s door. He LOCKS IT (by key) from
the outside.

ANNIE
Sorry. I know it’s irrational.
Green Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 18.

STEVE
Not at all.

Illustrating that it’s locked, Steve tries turning the knob.
Annie smiles.

ANNIE
Thank you.

She kisses Steve, feeling dopey.
Peter walks up to them, holding the PHONE.
PETER
Dad?

(extending phone)
It’s the cemetery.

ANNIE
About what?
STEVE
I‘ll see.
(into phone)
Hi... Yeah...

Steve walks down the hall to create distance between him and
Annie. Now irked, Annie walks off.

STEVE (CONT'D)
(into phone, warily)
Okay.... And what does “desecrated”
mean?
(listens, then -
shocked)
What? It's only been a week.

ANNIE steps back into the hall, now wearing a coat. Steve
nervously accelerates:

STEVE (CONT'D)
(into phone)

Okay. All right. Can I actually

call you back?... Okay, fine.
Steve hangs up.

ANNIE STEVE (CONT'D)

What was it? Nothing. Just billing crap.
Annie looks skeptical.
Steve notices Annie’s COAT. He gives her an inquiring look.

ANNIE
I’m gonna go see a movie.
20

Green Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 19.

STEVE
Okay. Right now?

ANNIE
I think I just need to get out of
the house for a second.

STEVE
..-Want me to join?

ANNIE

(hesitates)
I think I might just need like an
hour to myself. I’m really tense.

STEVE
Okay...great. I think you should.

Annie smiles “thanks.”

ANNIE
Do you know where Charlie is?

STEVE
Where else?

Annie knows what that means. She immediately looks
frustrated.

STEVE (CONT'D)
Let it go. It’s wasted energy.

ANNIE STEVE (CONT'D)
It’s below 30 outside! So let her catch a cold.
Maybe she needs one.

INT. TREEHOUSE - EVENING 20

Charlie sits in her treehouse. She lays the severed pigeon
head into her SHOEBOX. Inside this box are three other
SEVERED ANIMAL HEADS. One belongs to a rabbit, one to a rat,
one to a squirrel. (The heads are in different stages of
decomposition; flies buzz about.)

Down below, Annie is heard:

ANNIE (0.S.)
Charlie?

Charlie shuts the box, SHOVES it into a corner, and peers
down to see ANNIE at the tree’s base.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
Come on, sweetie. It’s freezing out
here.

No response from Charlie. Annie doesn’t push it.

ced
21

22

Green Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 20.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
Okay, well, I’m running out for a
sec. Is there anything I can bring

you back?
CHARLIE
(defensively)
Why??
INT. CAR (MOVING) - NIGHT 21

Annie idles into the parking lot of a Catholic high school.

She parks, turns off the engine, and sits in silence for a
moment. Bracing herself.

INT. CATHOLIC SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - NIGHT 22

A SUPPORT GROUP held in the high school’s gymnasium. A sign
on an easel reads “LOSING A LOVED ONE, Grief Recovery." The
session hasn’t yet started. Twenty empty chairs form a CIRCLE
in the space’s center.

Mourners of varying affect are scattered about, mingling.
Annie ENTERS, very ill-at-ease.
THIRTY MINUTES LATER

All the chairs are now filled. A middle-aged MEXICAN WOMAN
speaks (in Spanish) through coursing tears. A YOUNG MAN
translates for her as the rest of the group listens.

YOUNG MAN

(translating between her

sentences)
Sometimes I even get so relieved...
Because he was in so much pain, and
by the end he just hated himself.
Always saying “I’m a burden, I’ma
burden, I’m a burden”...

Annie’s eyes are wide. She’s empathizing with this, but it
seems to also be agitating her.

FIVE MINUTES LATER
The GROUP LEADER addresses the group.
LEADER
We've set aside some time for any
newcomers who might like to
speak...

Silence.
21.

LEADER (CONT'D)

So, anybody new - if it’s your
first or second time with us: the
floor is open.

Annie looks very torn. She starts to lift up her hand, but
stops short.

LEADER (CONT'D)
(gesturing to Annie)
Yes?

Annie looks panicked.

LEADER (CONT'D)
Would you like to...?

ANNIE
...-Maybe not.

LEADER
Okay. No pressure.

Annie nods, takes a long moment, and then forces herself:

ANNIE
My name’s Annie.

THE GROUP
Hi Annie.

Annie strains a smile. She continues tensely, as if against
her will:

ANNIE
My mom died a week ago, so I’m just
here for - trying it. I have a lot
of resistance to things like this,
but I went to these a couple years
ago - I was pressured to come - but
it did help, so...

(long pause)

My mom was old and she wasn’t all
together at the end - and we were
pretty much estranged before that -
so it wasn’t a huge blow. But I did
love her. And she didn’t have an
easy life... She had D.I.D., which
became extreme in the last year,
and dementia...! My dad died of
starvation when I was a baby. He
had psychotic depression and he
starved himself. Which I’m sure was
as pleasant as it sounds. And then
my older brother - he was
schizophrenic - and when he was
sixteen, he hanged himself in my
mom’s bedroom.

(MORE )
Green Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 22.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
Of course his suicide note blamed
her. Accusing her of putting people
inside of him.
(throws hands up)
So that was my mom’s life!

Annie looks to the group. They allow her time to continue.
She reluctantly proceeds.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
.--She finally lived in our house
at the end. Before hospice. We
weren’t talking before that -- or
we were and then we weren’t and
then we were - she was completely
manipulative - until finally my
husband enforced a No Contact rule,
which lasted until I was pregnant
with my daughter. I didn't let her
near me when I had my first - my
son - which is why I gave her my
daughter, who she immediately
stabbed her hooks into. And of
course I felt guilty again when she
got sick... Not that she was even
my mom at the end. And not that she
ever felt guilty. About anything.

Annie has worked herself up. A charged pause as she calms
back down.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
And I don’t wanna put any more
stress on my family. Not even sure
if they could give me that support.

She gets stuck here. Tears begin to well. She struggles to
squeeze out the following:

ANNIE (CONT'D)
It just all sometimes feels ruined.
And then I realize I'm to blame. Or
not that I'm to blame, but that
I'm...blamed.

Beat.

LEADER
And what do you think you feel
blamed for?

Annie looks to the leader. Pauses.

ANNIE
I apparently acted a certain way -
according to them - I did things,
in my sleep, a couple years ago. Or
almost did them...
23

26

Green Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 23.

Annie looks like she’s going to continue, but then she
abruptly cuts herself off. That’s it.

We reveal the mystified GROUP. They struggle to remain
sympathetic, despite their confusion.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
So anyway. Everything's
disappointing. So here I am.

She forces a laugh, but also cries a bit. She wipes away the
tears and makes an embarrassed “bah” face. She then motions
to the group: “Who’s next?”

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT 23

At the end of the hall, a very depleted Annie has just
finished scaling the stairs.

In the f.g., Peter’s door eases shut.
INT. PETER’S BEDROOM - SAME TIME 24

Peter's laptop is open. The browser displays BRIDGET’S
FACEBOOK PAGE. (Peter has been going through her photos.)
Behind that, another page displays “POPULAR CAREER
INTERESTS.”

Peter walks from the door (which he just closed) to his desk.
He grabs a small water pipe, packed with marijuana, and walks
to the window.

As Peter takes a hit from his pipe, his smartphone vibrates
with a TEXT. He checks it.

From “Brendan”:

Holy shit. Huge party tomorrow at Aaron’s house. Bring
your dick!

EXT. GRAHAM HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 25

A WIDE of the house. In the foreground seems to be someone’s
SHOULDER.

Pot smoke is blown out of Peter’s window, followed by a brief
fit of COUGHING.

INT. CHARLIE’S BEDROOM - THE NEXT DAY 26

Charlie, dressed in her pajamas and munching on M&Ms, sits at
her desk. She’s is finishing the torso for another small
human manikin. The limbs are made of different scraps.

To the side of Charlie’s sculpture-in-progress is the SEVERED
PIGEON HEAD. Beside that is Charlie’s drawing pad, open to an
unfinished STILL LIFE of the pigeon head. And on the far side
of the desk: a crude, bare stage for an unfinished DIORAMA.
27

29

Green Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 24.

As she works, Charlie makes the CLICKING SOUND with her
tongue.
Suddenly, a GLINT of light sweeps the room in a quick FLASH.
Charlie ceases drawing. Her clicking STOPS. Disturbed by the
flash, she raises her head and HOLDS. Listening for
something?
After a beat, Charlie rises from her seat and walks to the
WINDOW. It’s snowing outside. She stands there for a long
time, her back to us. She’s STARING at something...
INT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME 27
Annie is preparing dinner. Her smartphone DINGS with an
INCOMING EMAIL. It’s from The Asher Gallery. She opens it. It
reads:

Hi Annie!

Don't want to bother you, but we’d love to see where we are

(progress-wise). Could you possibly send us pics of your

work in its current stage? I promise we won't judge!! ;)
Annie looks suddenly overwhelmed.
EXT. WOODS - MINUTES LATER 28

The vast WOODED AREA behind the Graham house. It is still
snowing.

Charlie, wearing regular shoes and no coat (and still dressed
in her pajamas), takes wide steps as she slogs through the
snow.

She gazes listlessly ahead, as if in a TRANCE. She's being
drawn toward something. Like she’s sleepwalking with open
eyes.

Max, the family dog, follows happily behind. A FIRE is heard
crackling in the distance. Is this what she’s walking toward?

We cut to an EXTREME HIGH ANGLE - almost bird's eye. This
reveals that Charlie seems to be following a FRESH PATH OF
FOOTPRINTS (source unknown) leading off-screen.

INT. ANNIE’S WORKSHOP - SAME TIME 29

Annie is now WORKING INTENSELY on one of her miniatures. She
looks very anxious.

Peter appears at the door.

PETER
Hey, uh...

Annie looks up, visibly annoyed by the disturbance.
25.

PETER (CONT'D)
.«..do you think I could borrow one
of the cars tonight?

ANNIE
Why? Where are you going?

PETER
Oh, just like a school BBQ thing.

Annie continue working on the miniature, breaking
intermittently as they speak:

ANNIE
Does that mean you’re not having
dinner with us?

PETER
Oh, no, I was still gonna eat here.
ANNIE PETER (CONT'D)
Well - you can eat there if
you_want. I just didn’t No, I'll eat here. I'd just
realize. be going there to hang out.

Annie pauses. Her mind is not quite on this right now. She
takes a moment (pulling herself from her work) to assess the
questions that need to be asked.

ANNIE
No drinking?

PETER
Nobody’s old enough to even get
drinks if they wanted to.

ANNIE
Well, that’s a crock. I’m just
asking if you’re drinking.

PETER
Well, I just answered no.

Annie looks him hard in the eye before accepting that.

ANNIE
.».-You gonna take your sister?

PETER
Uh - does she want to go?

ANNIE
(mimicking his tone)
Uh - have you asked her?
30 EXT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER 30

Peter goes to Charlie’s room. She’s not there. He calls out:
31

32

Green Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 26.
PETER
Charlie?!
INT. WORKSHOP - MOMENTS LATER 31
Peter returns to the workshop.

PETER
She’s not in the house.

Frustrated, Annie throws down her paintbrush:

ANNIE
What? Yes she is.

EXT. WOODS - SAME TIME 32

Charlie is still walking through the snow. She sees in the
DISTANCE, almost too far away to distinguish...

A ring of BURNING TORCHES has been set up. Within this ring,
an OLD WOMAN'S INANIMATE BODY (dead?) stands erect - tied to
a pole, with her arms strapped to outstretched planks. The

body is dressed in FINE WHITE SILK. It looks like Ellen Leigh
(Charlie's grandmother), but it’s too far away to quite tell.

Charlie squints at this, barely reacting, when--

ANNIE (0.S.)
CHARLIE!

Charlie looks to ANNIE, who is running in her direction.
Charlie steps toward Annie.
ANNIE (CONT'D)
What are you doing?! It’s below
freezing out here!
Annie arrives at Charlie, not seeing the distant torches. She
seizes Charlie’s arm and starts leading her back to the
house.
ANNIE (CONT'D)
Are you an idiot? You can’t just
roam around - no coat, no boots!

Charlie YANKS her arm away from Annie.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
Oh - what? You’re angry with me?

Annie GRABS Charlie’s arm and PULLS her back toward the house.
CHARLIE

(under her breath)
I want grandma.
27.

ANNIE
Yeah. That makes one of us.

33 INT. FOYER - MOMENTS LATER 33

Annie and Charlie return. Annie aggressively stamps the snow
off her boots.

ANNIE
You're going to this party with
your brother.

CHARLIE
What party?

ANNIE
(trying to be softer)
A school hang-out with other kids.

CHARLIE
(evasive)
That’s okay.
ANNIE
No, it’s not okay. You’re going.
CHARLIE
Why?
ANNIE
Because it’ll be fun. You can hang
out.
. CHARLIE ANNIE (CONT'D)
With who? With your brother! With other

kids!

Peter has stepped into the hall. He nods, as if to say “yeah,
come along,” but his eyes are very uninviting.

CHARLIE
(as if to challenge
Peter)
...Fine.
ANNIE
Great. You’re going.
(to Peter)
She's going with you.
PETER
Great.
ANNIE

And that really means no drinking.

PETER
Yeah: I really wasn’t going to.
34

28.

EXT. HIGHWAY - EVENING 34

The sun has set. A FULL MOON glows pale-blue over a lonely
highway.

The Graham family car (the green one) FLASHES past.
INT. GRAHAM FAMILY CAR - CONTINUOUS 35
Peter is tense at the wheel. He drives the speed limit.

Peter’s eyes drift to the REAR VIEW MIRROR... Charlie,
sitting in the back, CLICKS her tongue.

Peter’s eyes narrow resentfully back onto the road.

The car passes a TELEPHONE POLE. Just an average telephone
pole. But we HOLD on it for a second longer than feels
necessary. Hyper-attentive viewers might notice that a small
SIGIL has been carved into it.

EXT. PARTY HOUSE - NIGHT 36

A large, modern house. The windows feature glimpses of a big
party, filled with circulating kids.

Peter and Charlie walk up the driveway. Charlie, suddenly
very nervous, starts slowing down.

CHARLIE
Maybe I don’t have to go in...

Peter stops.

PETER
Why? What’s wrong?

CHARLIE
It's okay. I can just stay out
here.

PETER
Charlie, you’re the one who wanted
to come.

CHARLIE

(not looking at him)
So you just go. I’1l be out here.

PETER
Charlie: If you don’t come in, I
have to take you back home, and
that’1ll take an hour.
37

29.

INT. PARTY HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER 37

The house is bustling. In the KITCHEN, two girls pull a CAKE
from the oven. Another girl (working on the frosting) CHOPS
up loads of WALNUTS on a chopping board.

ECU of the nuts being brutalized.

In the LIVING ROOM, Peter stands awkwardly with Charlie.
Charlie grips her drawing pad.

AARON (17), a preppy-looking kid, walks suspiciously over to
Peter. This is Aaron’s house.

AARON PETER
Hey. Hey. Nice house.

AARON
How did you hear about this?

PETER
Text.

Aaron nods, annoyed. He takes an aggressive sip of his drink.
Peter is uncomfortable.

PETER (CONT'D)
(forcing conversation)
Your parents are out of town?

Peter suddenly spots BRIDGET across the room. She sits on the
COUCH, obviously inebriated, nursing a beer. Completely
alone.

AARON
You didn’t bring beers or anything,
did you?

Peter turns back to Aaron, very impatient now.

PETER
What? No.
(first thing that comes
to mind)
I actually have to go to the
bathroom.

Aaron nods “yeah, whatever." Peter, already backing away,
turns to Charlie.

PETER (CONT'D)
Stay here one second, okay? I’m
just going to the bathroom.

Peter starts walking. Charlie immediately follows. Peter
feigns a trajectory toward the bathroom just behind Bridget.
As he walks, he pretends to notice her. He affects a
surprised face.
Green Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 30.
PETER (CONT’D)
Whoa, hey! What’s up?

BRIDGET
Oh. Hey.

Peter steps toward her. A brief pause.

PETER
How’s the party?
BRIDGET
(sarcastic)
Why? You wanna know if you should
come?
PETER
Uh - yeah. What do you think?
BRIDGET
(shrugs )
Whatever.
PETER

Okay, maybe I will.

BRIDGET
Okay, I’1ll see you here.

Another awkward pause.

PETER
Do you happen to smoke at all?

BRIDGET
Smoke what?

Peter pinches into his pocket. He reveals the top of a rolled-
up BAG OF MARIJUANA.

BRIDGET (CONT'D)
(not seeing)
Is that tobacco or weed?

PETER
Really awesome weed.

Bridget considers, and then:
BRIDGET
("why not?”)
I could get more high.
She stands up.

BRIDGET (CONT'D)
The other room has a bong.
38

31.

Bridget gestures for him to follow her. Peter starts to walk,
but then notices Charlie following him.

PETER
Hey. You wanna stay out here for a
second?

CHARLIE
Nope.

PETER

Charlie: please: Only for two
minutes and then we can hang out.
You can draw.

Bridget is already at the DOOR to the other room. She looks
expectantly at Peter, who turns again (desperately) to
Charlie.

PETER (CONT'D)
Please Charlie, I promise. I just
need to do something really quick.

Peter then SEES something.

PETER (CONT'D)
Oh shit. Look:

He’s pointing at the KITCHEN. The teen girls are now cutting
into a fresh CHOCOLATE CAKE. They hand slices around.

PETER (CONT'D)
They’re giving out chocolate cake.

CHARLIE PETER (CONT'D)
Not to everyone. Yes they are. It’s a party.

CHARLIE
I don’t know anyone.

PETER
Nobody does. Just walk over, stand
there, and they’1ll give you one.
Peter starts walking off, still facing Charlie:
PETER (CONT'D)
You should hurry, they’re gonna run
out, I’1l be right back! Hurry!

Peter rushes over to Bridget as she OPENS the door to the
other room. Charlie looks nervously to the kitchen.

INT. OTHER ROOM - CONTINUOUS 38

Two BOYS - one Hispanic and one blonde - are in the room,
watching videos on a tablet. Bridget enters, addressing them:
39

40

32.

BRIDGET
Hey guys, Peter has weed.

The boys turn to Peter. Peter immediately deflates.

HISPANIC BOY (0.S.)
Sativa or indica?

INT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME 39
Charlie steps into the doorway. Extremely shy. Her eyes are
magnetized to the CHOCOLATE CAKE as the girls continue
handing out slices.

One GIRL notices Charlie's fixed eyes. She warmly offers
Charlie a slice. Charlie accepts without looking her in the
eye.

CHARLIE
Thanks.

Charlie turns, digging into the cake. (Nuts are visibly a key
ingredient. )

INT. OTHER ROOM - SAME TIME 40

Peter sits on the bed, beside Bridget. He packs marijuana
into the bowl of a large bong.

BRIDGET
That was your sister, right?

PETER
Yeah. Charlie.

Peter’s cell phone VIBRATES.
HISPANIC BOY
(to Peter)
Is your sister hot?

Peter checks the cell. It’s ANNIE calling. Tense, he tucks
the phone back into his pocket.

BRIDGET
I actually saw her drawing me last
week.

PETER
Oh yeah?

BRIDGET

Yeah, she made me look crazy.

PETER
That’s Charlie.
4l

42

43

33.

Peter’s phone VIBRATES again. A yellow “Message Waiting”
light blinks. Annie has left a VOICEMAIL.

INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME 41

Charlie walks around, holding an empty plate, her lips
covered in chocolate. She stops for a moment to SWALLOW. She
pauses, then swallows again. She looks slightly concerned.

Charlie goes to a stack of RED CUPS and pulls one.

She goes to the kitchen faucet and draws herself a cup of
water.

INT. ANNIE’S WORKSHOP - NIGHT 42

Annie is working on the miniature of the Graham house. She
plants a freshly-painted FIGURINE of a ghostly old woman ina
bathrobe (clearly Annie’s MOTHER) in the upstairs hall. The
figurine looms outside the open door of the master bedroom
replica, where figurines of Annie and Steve are asleep in
bed.

INT. PARTY HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 43
The party is still in full swing.

Charlie has found her way onto the COUCH and is now
assembling a small manikin from disparate parts (from her
pocket). Her cheeks look pink and slightly INFLAMED. An
allergic reaction to the cake? It looks like she’s on the
verge of throwing up, but she keeps her concentration on the
manikin.

A concerned BOY (16) approaches Charlie. Not recognizing that
she’s a girl:

CONCERNED BOY (0.S.)
Hey dude, you okay? You want some
water?
Charlie doesn’t even look up.

CHARLIE
I’m okay.

CONCERNED BOY
You sure?

CHARLIE
Mm-hmm.

The Boy hesitantly walks off.

Charlie does NOT look good.
44

45

46

34.

INT. OTHER ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 44
Peter is drawing an impressive bong hit.
The door is OPENED by Charlie.

CHARLIE
Peter?

This is just as Peter finishes inhaling. He COUGHS up smoke.
PETER
(like a chimney)
Charlie!

Peter immediately hides the bong behind his legs and looks to
Charlie, affecting casualness.

PETER (CONT'D)
(still spouting smoke)
What’s up?
Charlie looks scared.

PETER (CONT'D)
Are you okay?

CHARLIE
It’s hard to breathe.

Charlie’s voice is cracked and strange.

PETER
What do you mean?

CHARLIE
(tearing up)
My tongue is getting bigger.
HARD CUT TO:
EXT. CAR - NIGHT 45

A distraught Peter pulls Charlie to the car. Charlie’s eyes
bulge and her face is pitch-red. She seems UNABLE TO BREATHE.

Peter desperately opens the back door, guides Charlie in,
slams the door, and runs to the driver side of the car.

INT. CAR (MOVING) - NIGHT 46
Peter speeds down the empty HIGHWAY. In the back seat,
Charlie GASPS and gurgles for breath. She KICKS at the door
and GRASPS at her throat. Tears of pain stream down her face.

Peter ACCELERATES. Speeding from 60 MPH to 65.
35.

PETER

You're okay, Charlie! We’re going

to the hospital!
Charlie frantically rolls down her window. Desperate for air.
Peter continues accelerating. 70 MPH.
Charlie forces her head through the BACK PASSENGER WINDOW.
She GASPS for breath, but her throat is swollen shut. She
can’t even scream.

Peter continues accelerating. 75 MPH.

Charlie sticks her squealing head even farther out the
window.

Peter continues accelerating. 80... 85... But THEN--

A grisly DEER CARCASS, smeared across the road, appears in
the car’s headlights.

Peter SWERVES out of the way.

CHARLIE’S HEAD, flailing out of the window, COLLIDES FACE-
FIRST WITH A TELEPHONE POLE. The impact is so great that
Charlie’s head is RIPPED OFF its shoulders.

The decapitated head SAILS silently in the car’s wake.

Peter STOMPS on the brakes. The car SQUEALS to an ear-
splitting halt.

The frozen car chugs quietly. Suspended in time.

Peter sits motionless. Paralyzed. His eyes are fixed on the
road in front of him.

In the SIDE-VEW MIRROR, the dead deer (thirty feet back) is
faintly visible in the car’s brake lights. Bathed in red.

Peter doesn’t dare look back. His foot is jammed into the
brake.

In the back seat, Charlie sits headless. A torso.

Peter’s EYES begin to stray toward the REAR-VIEW MIRROR, but
they STOP before they get there. Peter can’t look.

Peter reaches for the rear-view mirror and subtly turns it
AWAY.

The “Voicemail Waiting” light (from Peter's cell) blinks
through the fabric of his jeans pocket.

A long moment of silence, and then...
47

48

49

36.

Peter’s foot slowly eases OFF the brake pedal.

The car begins to slowly idle forward.

Peter, eyes locked on the road ahead, allows the car to
slowly pick up speed. His demeanor suggests that he’s in
great denial. As if he’s saying to himself “it’s okay,
nothing happened."

The car drives onward. The headless torso rattles gently in
the back seat.

EXT. GRAHAM HOUSE - NIGHT 47

The car idles quietly into the driveway. It PARKS beside the
other family car, but the engine continues humming.

The driver door opens, setting off the dull DING-DING-DING of
the “door open/engine on” alarm. After a long pause, the
engine is turned off. Peter steps out, as if in a dream
state.

He walks stiffly away from the car and into the house.

INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 48

Peter stalks woodenly through the hall. He walks into his
bedroom, leaving Annie and Steve to their sleep.

Peter climbs into bed, his door left open.
INT. BEDROOM - THE NEXT MORNING 49
The next morning.

CLOSE-UP on Peter’s face, turned halfway into his pillow. His
eyes are wide open.

Downstairs, we hear Annie pulling on her coat.

ANNIE (V.O.)
I’m running out for some balsa
wood. You want anything?

STEVE (V.O.)
I’m good, baby. Drive safe.

ANNIE (V.O.)
Okay! Back in twenty!

The front door is heard opening and shutting. We then hear:
Annie walking to the car... The car door opening... Annie
beginning to climb in. And then... Silence. Followed by...

A horrible SCREAM, shrill and almost inhuman-sounding, issues
from outside. Peter’s eyes WIDEN.
50

51

52

37.

Annie is heard staggering backwards and falling down,
muttering (almost inaudibly) “No, no, no, no..." Downstairs
(in the house) Steve is heard reacting and running to the
front door. Before he makes it outside, Annie lets out
another blood-curdling SHRIEK, which prompts a HARD CUT TO:

EXT. HIGHWAY - MORNING 50

CHARLIE’S HEAD rests by the side of the road. The nose is
completely smashed in. One eye is pitch red and the other is
milky and opaque. The head is completely covered in ANTS.

The halted shriek (from the last shot) ECHOES OFF into the
wretched silence of this shot.

The sound of THUNDER bridges our cut to:
INT. GRAHAM HALLWAY - NIGHT 51
A STORM rages outside.

Annie and Steve’s bedroom door is cracked open. We barely see
ANNIE lying in bed, WEEPING and MOANING. Steve, sitting on
the bed, consoles her. He tries to feed her a pill.

ANNIE
NO! I can't! I can't! I just wanna
die!... I can't.

Steve rubs her head as she sinks into a more placid despair.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
.--It hurts too much. I just need
to die.

And then more feelings come SURGING up. She MOANS an
anguished moan.

We reveal PETER, standing paralyzed on the stairs, LISTENING.
His mother’s cries shred at his nerves.

ANNIE (0.S.) (CONT'D)
CHARLIE!!!

EXT. CEMETERY - DAY 52

An overcast day. A sad gathering of mourners. Annie, Peter
and Steve stand lost among them.

We are at a distance. The COFFIN (in profile) is being
lowered into the ground. We are booming down to FOLLOW the
sinking casket (keeping it centered), and as the coffin
descends into the earth, so do we. We slowly creep down,
losing sight of the cemetery and the mourners. We continue
tracking down along the DIRT and the EARTHWORMS and the
WEEDS, Sinking deeper and deeper into the dark, wet soil.
Soon we are swallowed up again in BLACK.

38.

INT. HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON 53

THE WAKE. Everything seems slightly opaque, as if seen
through glass. Glossed over by grief.

People stand uneasily and talk in hushed tones.

STEVE stands in a daze, politely (but absently) accepting
condolences.

INT. ANNIE & STEVE’S BEDROOM - SAME TIME 54
Annie lies in bed, facing the wall. Her back is tous.

INT. LIBRARY - SAME TIME 55
Peter stands (hiding?) in the family library, anxiously
massaging his CELL PHONE with his thumb. He looks completely
battered by trauma and self-loathing.

He observes the wake in the adjacent living room through the
distortion of the library's textured glass door. He watches
Steve shake someone’s hand.

A MAN (40s) steps into the library, not expecting to find
Peter.

MAN
(surprised)
Peter. How are you?

Peter smiles politely, but can’t answer. His eyes look almost
deranged.

MAN (CONT'D)
Can I get you anything?

PETER
I’m just gonna use the bathroom.

MAN
Okay.

As Peter walks stiffly past, smiling his forced smile, the
Man awkwardly adds:

MAN (CONT’D) tos PETER
I’m so sorry for your loss. (exiting)
Thank you.
INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS 56

Peter hastily enters the bathroom and LOCKS the door.

He stands frozen for a moment, battling panic. The sounds of
the wake persist in the other room.

Peter turns on the SINK to create white noise.
57

INT. LIVING ROOM - EVENING 57

The remaining mourners are slowly filtering out. Steve
politely ushers them, thanking them for coming.

Soon, everyone’s gone. Steve just stands there, in the middle
of the room. Lost.

INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER 58

Steve goes to the bathroom door. Tries to open it. It’s
LOCKED. The running sink is faintly heard.

Steve pauses, then knocks gently.

STEVE
Peter?

No answer.
INT. BATHROOM - SAME TIME 59

Peter sits on the edge of the tub. The sink is still running.
He holds his cell to his ear, listening to VOICEMAIL.

INT. ANNIE & STEVE’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER 60

Steve approaches his bedroom, but STOPS at the open door.
Annie is no longer in bed. The sheets have been dragged
halfway off the mattress (presumably by Annie’s feet when she
left).

INT. CHARLIE’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER 61
Charlie’s lonely bedroom. Everything is as it was.

The door OPENS. It’s Steve. He stands at the door, taking the
room in. After a moment, he steps inside.

MOMENTS LATER

Steve sits on Charlie’s bed. He has pulled up Charlie's
DRAWING PAD.

Steve opens the pad. He flips slowly through the pages. He
takes care to really look at the drawings. As if appreciating
them for the first time.

Steve passes several drawings of severed animal heads
(including those of the rabbit, the rat and the cat, which we
saw in Charlie’s shoebox). Steve then comes to Charlie’s half-
finished drawing of the pigeon head (which now dons a CROWN).
Steve studies it, and then turns the page to discover..

BLANK PAGE. There are no more drawings.

The floodgates open. Steve WEEPS.

INT. CHARLIE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 62
Charlie’s bedroom is EMPTY again. It’s snowing outside.

The door is open, and the hallway’s lights are off.

Framed by the doorway, Peter walks past, determinedly not
looking into the room.

INT. PETER’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 63

Peter enters. Without changing out of his clothes, he climbs
into bed. The ALARM CLOCK reads 10:10 PM.

He turns to his side and gazes out the WINDOW. The imposing
TREEHOUSE looms just outside. He stares at it.

LATER

Peter rolls huffily from his stomach to his back, unable to
sleep. He turns to the ALARM CLOCK. It now reads 1:32 AM.

A beat, and then Peter climbs out of bed, gathers his blanket
and pillow, and leaves the room.

EXT. GRAHAM HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER 64
Peter, wearing his parka and an Elmer Fudd hat, emerges from
the back door of the house. He carries his blanket and pillow
through the light snowfall, heading for the TREEHOUSE.

He notes Charlie’s SHOEBOX near the base of the tree (having
been dropped from the treehouse?). Flies are audible inside.

Peter grips the tree’s climbing handles and scales the tree.

INT. TREEHOUSE - CONTINUOUS 65

Peter climbs in. He lays out his blanket and lies down,
positioning his pillow under his head. Now situated, he
begins to close his eyes, but before they can shut, he SENSES
something behind him. He slowly look back to SEE:

ANNIE IS SLEEPING IN THE CORNER, bundled up in blankets.

Startled, Peter STAGGERS out of his blanket, GRABS his
things, and rushes frantically out of the treehouse. In his
haste, his foot SLIPS OFF one of the wet climbing handles. He
falls to land HARD on his back.

In pain, Peter rises and limps back toward the house.
WE SLOWLY DISSOLVE FROM THIS TO...
INT. CLASSROOM - DAY 66

Peter sits in the back of class as a teacher drones on at the
blackboard. The teacher’s voice is distant and vague, as if
heard from UNDER WATER.

Peter’s EYES are busy with nagging, obsessive thoughts. They
narrow upward to his right.

We flash briefly to an INSERT of the family car’s REAR VIEW
MIRROR (from Peter’s POV) on the night of the accident. The
mirror is in focus, but whatever’s in the BACK SEAT
(Charlie's headless body) is blurry and just out of the
mirror’s view.

We return to the CLASS. Peter snaps out of his reverie to see
BRIDGET looking at him. Their eyes briefly MEET before she
quickly turns back to the teacher.

Peter’s eyes HARDEN.
EXT. GRAHAM HOUSE = DAY 67

Annie draws the MAIL out of the mailbox. Among the letters is
a BROCHURE. It reads “Calling All Skeptics!" Below that: “A
PUBLIC SEANCE to be conducted by famed spiritual medium,
Suzanne Marlowe!”

Annie goes PALE at the sight of this. She looks around,
suddenly paranoid - as if nervous that she’s being watched.

INT. WORKSHOP - DAY 68

Annie is at work, trying to make progress on the HOSPICE
MINIATURE. Her eyes are numb. She looks exhausted. She turns
in her swivel-chair to face the miniature of the GRAHAM
HOUSE. She stares at it.

Off-screen, the front door is heard UNLOCKING. Annie looks in
the direction of the noise.

INT. FOYER - SAME TIME 69
The front door opens and Steve enters.

STEVE
Annie?!

Max runs up to greet Steve, his tail wagging excitedly.
INT. WORKSHOP - SAME TIME 70
Annie goes to the door. Steve is heard scaling the stairs.
Before he can reach the top, Annie silently eases the door
shut.

INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 71

The workshop door quietly CLOSES just before Steve appears at
the top of the stairs. He approaches the workshop.

He knocks on the door.
No answer.

He eases the door open. Annie “works” with her back to the
door. She’s now wearing HEADPHONES, “listening” to classical
music.

Steve smiles sadly and closes the door, leaving Annie to her
work.

INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER 72

Steve enters the kitchen. Mail waits on the kitchen island.
He finds the BROCHURE for the public seance, and DUMPS it in
the trash.

In the b.g., Annie CROSSES the doorway. Steve doesn’t see.
EXT. GRAHAM HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON 73

Annie sits in the blue family car, parked in the driveway.
(The green car - the “accident” car - is now permanently
gone.) Annie is trying to work up the nerve to start the
engine. Then, in the SIDE-VIEW MIRROR, she sees:

Peter rides his BICYCLE up the driveway. He arrives at the
front porch, but stays on the bike. He doesn’t see Annie.

Annie has TENSED UP. She sits motionless for fear of being
seen, eyes LOCKED on Peter. He stands for a long time at the
front door, preparing to face his family.

Annie watches as Peter continues to gather himself. He
finally takes a decisive breath, gets off the bike, and
quietly enters the house.
74

43.

Annie remains tense. She turns on the car’s IGNITION.
EXT. CATHOLIC HIGH SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - EVENING 74

Annie idles into the parking lot of the HIGH SCHOOL GYMNASIUM
(from earlier). Outside, the same SUPPORT GROUP is gathering.

Annie pulls into a spot. Turns off the ignition. She stares
at the gymnasium door. Watches tensely as people solemnly
enter. She doesn’t move.

After a long internal debate, Annie finally STARTS the car
back up, and begins to drive off. As she approaches the exit,
an OLDER WOMAN (late 60s) runs suddenly - and merrily - into
the HEADLIGHTS, flagging Annie down. Annie BRAKES.

The woman circles over to Annie’s window. Annie hesitantly
rolls it down.

OLDER WOMAN
Hi! Hello. Sorry to chase you down.
(awkwardly)
Were you not coming in?

ANNIE
(cornered)
I, no, I just - forgot something.

OLDER WOMAN
Okay, sorry, I just - I recognized
you from a few months ago. You were
here because your mother?

ANNIE
Oh...

OLDER WOMAN
I feel crazy now. Sorry! I’m Joan.

ANNIE
(feeling trapped)
Hi.
JOAN
Are you doing any better?
ANNIE
What?
JOAN

With your mother...?

ANNIE
(still confused)
What?
(and then)
No. That’s not... My daughter was
killed.
44,
JOAN
Oh. My God. I’m so, so sorry.
Brief, heavy silence. Joan stammeringly offers:
JOAN (CONT'D)
Would you like to come in with me?
Or we can even just get a coffee.
There’s a place down the street.
ANNIE
I’m sorry. Really. Thank you.
(gesturing to leave)
I really did forget something.
Joan bluntly offers:

OLDER WOMAN
My son died.

ANNIE
Oh...! I’m so sorry.

Joan smiles tightly, heartbroken.

JOAN
How old was yours?

Annie looks like she’s being held hostage.

ANNIE
(pained to say it)
Fourteen.
JOAN

Oh God, that’s awful!

(matter of fact)
My son and my grandson drowned.
Four months ago. The little one was

seven.
ANNIE
(horrified)
Oh my God.
JOAN

I’ve been coming here for a month
now and it has helped. I just
wanted to say. It has. It doesn’t
make it easier - obviously. But
sometimes it just, makes it less
lonely.

ANNIE
(awkwardly)
Okay...
45.

JOAN
And I’m gonna embarrass myself now,
but if you ever need someone to
talk to...
Joan writes her PHONE NUMBER onto a piece of paper.

JOAN (CONT'D)
‘Cause we all do.

She hands Annie the phone number.

JOAN (CONT'D)
Just if you need it.

ANNIE
Okay. Thank you. Really.

Annie is moved, despite her discomfort. Joan walks off,
giving Annie a warm little wave.

75 INT. FOYER - NIGHT 75
Annie lumbers in. She pulls off her snow boots.
76 INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 76

Steve is asleep in an armchair, bathed in the dim glow of the
muted TV. Annie appears in the doorway.

ANNIE
Hey.
STEVE
(waking up)
Oh! Hey.
ANNIE STEVE (CONT'D)
I’m going to bed. Where were you?
ANNIE
At the movies. I’m going to bed.
STEVE
I’1l come with you.
ANNIE
(put off)

..-Okay.
Annie leaves the doorway.

STEVE
And can you please let me know when
you're going to the movies? I was
worried.
46.

77 INT. ANNIE & STEVE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 77

Annie and Steve are in bed. Annie’s back is to Steve. Neither
is asleep.

Steve gently SNUGGLES UP to Annie, but she is like stone. He
self-consciously touches her hip. She recoils.

Steve backs off. There is a long moment of tension, and then
Annie RISES from bed.

ANNIE
I’m gonna be right back.

She gathers a blanket, which is bundled on the room’s
armchair.

STEVE
You're not coming right back.
You're taking the blanket.

ANNIE
I can’t sleep.

STEVE
Annie: it’s freezing outside.

ANNIE
The heater’s up there.

Steve wants to fight this, but Annie is clearly anxious to
avoid a conversation.

STEVE
.-Okay.
ANNIE
Is that okay?
STEVE
(“what am I supposed to
say?”)
Yeah. Fine. Come back if you get
cold.
ANNIE

I just need to sleep.
Annie leaves.
78 INT. TREEHOUSE - NIGHT 78
We push in on an ominous WIDE of Annie lying asleep in

Charlie’s treehouse. Two LARGE HEATERS have been set up on
either side of her. They burn a BRIGHT ORANGE.

Green Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 47.

INT. PETER’S BEDROOM - SAME TIME 79

Peter lies in bed, awake. Outside his window, Charlie’s
treehouse emits an orange glow.

A CLICKING SOUND (like Charlie’s tongue-clicking) is suddenly
heard in the room. Peter FREEZES, now listening for it. After
a moment, there’s another CLICK.

Peter BOLTS up in bed. His eyes frenziedly scan the room. He
fixes on a DARK CORNER. A HOODIE SWEATSHIRT hangs on the
wall, and for a brief moment, it looks almost like a standing
person.

Peter continues listening intently for another click...
Silence. It has stopped.

INT. WORKSHOP - THE NEXT DAY 80
Outside, a beautiful day.

Inside, Annie is hard at work. Her eyes are intense - furious
even - as she carefully works on the replica of Charlie’s
bedroom. She scratches a tiny replica of the word-carving she
saw earlier ("Satony”) into the wall behind the bed. As she
does this, her attention is drawn to a looming POST-IT NOTE,
which reads:

Call gallery about extending?

Annie disregards this. She goes for a new bottle of paint,
but as she reaches, an open paint bottle is KNOCKED over.

ANNIE
Shit.

It tipped over near Annie’s extending hand, but it didn’t
look like Annie actually touched it.

Annie grabs paper towels and quickly mops up the mess. She
pulls a few drenched items out of the widening paint puddle.
Among them: JOAN’S PHONE NUMBER. She looks at it.

INT. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY 81
Peter walks absent-mindedly down the hall. THREE STONER BOYS
(including Brendan) are walking toward him, huddled and
giggling. They notice Peter.

BRENDAN
Yo, Pete.

PETER
Hey.
82

48.

BRENDAN
(whispering)
You wanna join us for a walk?

On “walk,” he mimes pinching a joint with his thumb and
forefinger.

EXT. HIGH SCHOOL SOCCER FIELD - DAY 82

Peter sits under the BLEACHERS with the three stoners. They
pass around a PIPE packed with weed. Brendan takes a hit.

BRENDAN
(looking at his phone)
Am I the only one who’s Facebook
friends with Becky?

Brendan passes the pipe to Peter.

STONER #2
You're friends with Becky?

Peter holds the pipe. Stares at it.

BRENDAN STONER #3
Facebook friends, bitch!
(back to his point)
Oh my God, her statuses... Oh my God, dude, I know.

BRENDAN
Every ten seconds!

Peter LIGHTS the bowl and takes a reluctant hit.

BRENDAN (CONT'D)

“I'm going to the bathroom now.”
5:45. “Just got back from the
bathroom!” 5:46.

Peter COUGHS OUT a lungful of pot smoke. He immediately looks
regretful.

STONER #2 BRENDAN (CONT'D)
What about Brian with his . .
girlfriend? Ha! His “princess”?!

Stoner #2 nods his head, choking on laughter.

Peter’s eyes are wide with a burgeoning panic. He does not
look well.

STONER #2 (0.S.)
“Going to pick up my princess from
the airport!” “Eating cous-cous
with my princess!”

Peter looks like he’s starting to have an ATTACK. The Stoners
are oblivious.
49.

STONER #3
Who's his girlfriend?

STONER #2
Some fuckin’ stupid college chick.

STONER #3
What the fuck?! I want some stupid
college princess chick.

Stoner #2 notices that Peter is freaking out.

STONER #2
Dude. Are you okay?

PETER
I feel like I can’t breathe.

STONER #2
What?

PETER
I feel like I’m having a reaction.

BRENDAN PETER (CONT'D)
No, man, don’t freak out. You
just smoked too much. No, I think I need a doctor.
My tongue is getting bigger.

Peter is crying now.

STONER #2
Should we take you to the nurse??

PETER
(scared)
I dunno.

BRENDAN
Look, dude: you’re breathing. See?
You're just really high.

Peter is trying to calm down.

BRENDAN (CONT'D)
See? You’re okay. You just got too
high.
(rubbing his back)
You're okay, dude. You’re
breathing.

Stoner #2 and Stoner #3 exchange “holy shit” looks.
83 EXT. STREET - DAY 83
Annie walks down an urban street, looking for an address. She

pinches the paper with Joan’s number. On its other side is an
ADDRESS in Annie’s handwriting.
84

85

86

Green Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 50.
Annie finds the address. A large, red-brick APARTMENT
BUILDING.
INT. APARMENT BUILDING - THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY - DAY 84
The elevator opens, depositing Annie onto the THIRD FLOOR.
Annie proceeds down the well-lit hall, arriving at APARTMENT
316. She knocks.
While waiting, Annie looks down. She’s standing on a HAND-
MADE WELCOME MAT. The word “JOANIE” has been embroidered into
it.

After a moment, the door is opened by JOAN.

JOAN
Annie! You came!
ANNIE JOAN (CONT'D)
It’s a little earlier than we .
said. Ah, you're perfect. Come in.
INT. JOAN’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 85

Annie follows Joan in. Joan closes the door behind them. The
apartment is cheerfully decorated in bright, homey colors.

Joan rushes off to the KITCHEN, where a TEA KETTLE is
whistling. Annie stays by the door.

ANNIE
Your welcome mat...

JOAN
Oh - it’s cute, right?

Joan pulls the kettle off the stove and pours two cups.

ANNIE
My mother used to embroider ones
just like that.

JOAN
Oh really? How funny!

Joan sets the tea on the KITCHEN table.

JOAN (CONT'D)
Please. Sit.

MINUTES LATER 86

Joan and Annie sit at the table, nursing their tea. The
conversation has become very heavy, and the spotlight is
currently on a very fragile Annie. She speaks steadily, in
fragments, as if to hold herself together. Her eyes are fixed
on the floor.
51.

ANNIE
He left her in the back seat. Went
straight to bed.

Joan nods sympathetically. Her eyes locked attentively on
Annie.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
And then I wake up. Went to my
workshop. Needed some supplies. I
go down to the car. Step inside.
First the smell of something wrong.
Then the - body. Slumped. Covered
in black, blood, like tar...
(fighting tears)
And her head wasn’t there, so I
couldn’t see her face. But they
were her clothes. And her hands...
her fingernails...

Joan is pale as she listens. Annie is trembling, locked on
the memory.

Joan gently lays her hand over Annie’s. Beat.

JOAN
When they dragged up my son and
grandson, they needed me to identify
the bodies. But they didn’t warn me
what bodies look like after they've
been in the ocean. You can probably
imagine - they swell up, get
distended, turn grey. I didn’t know
that. My son’s eyes were eaten out
of his head by fish. And my
grandson's face - like a balloon.

Annie is looking up at Joan now. They share in this. The
grisly details are somehow (in their morbid way) comforting.

Breaking the spell, Annie pulls a PILL from her purse. She
downs it with a gulp of TEA. She catches something on her
tongue, and pulls a BLACK HERB from her mouth. She pays it no
mind.

JOAN (CONT'D)
I can sometimes swear I feel them in
the room... Do you ever have that?

ANNIE
..-Small moments maybe.

This hangs for a moment.
JOAN

How’s your relationship with your
son?
Green Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 52.

ANNIE
.-.-Peter?

Joan brightens: “That’s his name?” Annie thinks about Joan’s
question.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
Oh God...

Her face DARKENS and she chuckles. She brushes it off, but
then PAUSES. She decides to actually answer.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
I sleepwalk.

(pause)
I haven't in a long time, but two
years ago I woke up - and I really
don’t remember this because I was
asleep - but I woke up standing next
to Peter and Charlie’s bed (when they
shared a room), and they were
completely covered in paint
thinner... And so was I. From head to
toe... And I was standing there, and
I was holding a box of matches. And I
woke myself up by striking one. Which
also woke up Peter. And he started
screaming. And I immediately put out
the match, immediately, but my
husband came in... and I was just as
shocked as he was, but I was the one
with the matches.

Joan is listening with no judgment. Annie, frustrated by the
memory, takes a deep breath.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
And it was impossible to convince
them that it was just sleepwalking -
which of course it was - but the
timing was awful, Peter and I had
already fallen into this stupid
quarrelling phase - arguing forever
about nothing - such frivolous
things - but that’s when the
incident happened, so...!

(throws her hands up)
Over time, everyone affected
casualness, “moving on.” But they
never forgot and Peter’s always
held it against me and there's
nothing I can say and there’s
nothing I can do because it
happened. While I was asleep.

JOAN
Did your daughter hold it against
you?
87

88

53.

ANNIE
Oh, she was off in the clouds
somewhere. Probably didn’t even
notice.

Beat.

JOAN
(empathic)
It’s impossible being a mother.

Annie looks at Joan. “Yes it is.”
INT. GRAHAM HOUSE - KITCHEN- MOMENTS LATER 87

Steve is chopping carrots at the kitchen island. Peter is
heard ENTERING in the foyer.

STEVE
Hey, that was fast. Did you bike
all the way here?

PETER
(voice cracked)
My friend dropped me.

STEVE
Oh - you should've invited him in.

But Peter’s already going for the stairs. Steve tries to
catch up with him.

STEVE (CONT'D)
Did you remember to sign up for
that SAT prep course?

Peter has made it to the top of stairs. Hiding his wrought
face:

PETER STEVE (CONT'D
I will tomorrow. You need to, Peter! That’s
coming up!
INT. PETER’S ROOM - DAY 88

Peter lies in bed, on his side. He looks ready to burst back
into tears.

Steve knocks on the door. Pokes his head in.

STEVE
Peter?

Peter turns to him, stifling tears.

STEVE (CONT'D)
Are you okay?
Green Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 54.

PETER
(deflecting)
Are you?
Pause.
STEVE

Is there anything we can talk
about, Peter?

PETER
Like what?

STEVE
Like anything. What’s going on?
What are you feeling?

PETER
What are you feeling?

STEVE
I’m worried about you.

Peter stares at Steve, eyes wide. Unable to communicate.

STEVE (CONT'D)
(careful)

It doesn’t have to be with me,

either. Maybe you’d like to talk

with somebody else...

PETER
About what?

STEVE
About everything. You’re going
through a lot, Peter.

PETER
So are you!

STEVE
Well - we all are. I think we could
all use someone to talk to.

PETER
So why aren’t you, then?
STEVE
I probably will. I probably need

to.
A long, fraught pause.

STEVE (CONT'D)

You don’t have to choose now. I’m
just letting you know that it’s
there.

(MORE)
Green Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 55.

STEVE (CONT'D)
You could even see one of the guys
in my building. I know a few guys.

PETER
(warming up to it?)
.».-And you think I need to go?

STEVE
(briefest pause)
Well, that’s for you to say. I
can’t tell you your experience.

Peter suddenly deflates . Not the answer he needed. He chills
over.

PETER
Maybe later.

STEVE
...-Okay. Let me know.

PETER
Okay.

Steve nods for a long time. Trying to think of anything else.

STEVE
All right. Dinner in a bit.

Steve smiles sensitively. Too sensitive. He leaves.
89 INT. WORKSHOP - NIGHT 89

Annie is at work. Behind her, the door opens and Steve
enters. He approaches to see...

Annie is working on a new piece: a NEW MINIATURE of the
HIGHWAY of Charlie’s accident, including the TELEPHONE POLE
that took her head. This also features a tiny figurine of
Charlie’s decapitated head and a figurine of Peter in the
family car.

STEVE
Oh Jesus... Are you planning on
letting him see that?

ANNIE
Who?

STEVE

(strong pause)
How do you think Peter’s gonna feel
about that?

ANNIE
What? It’s not about him.
Green Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 56.

STEVE
Oh no?

ANNIE
...It’s an objective view of the
accident!

Steve just eyes her.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
Okay, so what is it, then?

STEVE ANNIE (CONT'D)
It’s cruel, Annie. And

unforgiving... Oh my God!
STEVE
And useless.
ANNIE
(incredulous)

What do you think I’m trying to say
with this?! You think I’d ever want
to hurt my own son?! Are you
crazy?!

Steve almost responds, but bites his tongue.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
Oh Jesus you're sanctimonious. I
get it: you’re a good father,
you’re a good husband - get off the
stage.

Steve boils.

STEVE
(through clenched teeth)
Are you coming to dinner?

ANNIE
I’m making dinner!

STEVE
(snapping)
I made dinner! I’m GETTING you for
dinner!
(storms away)
Come down or stay here, I don’t
give a shit.

On “give”, he SLAMS the door behind him.
90 INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT 90
Annie, Steve and Peter sit at the dinner table. A fourth chair

divides Annie and Peter. Annie is fuming from her last
interaction with Steve. Beside her glass: an unswallowed pill.
57.

PETER
This is really good, dad.

Annie balks to herself. Peter tenses.

STEVE
Thanks buddy.

Annie mouths the word “buddy” to herself, incredulous. Peter
catches this.

PETER
(with an edge)
You okay, mom?

Annie turns to Peter.

ANNIE
What?

PETER
Is there something on your mind?

Annie can’t believe this.

ANNIE
Is there something on your mind?

PETER
It just looks like you might want
to say something.

STEVE
(stepping in)
Peter...

ANNIE
Like what? Why would I want to say
something? So I can watch you can
roll your eyes at me?

PETER ANNIE (CONT'D)

I have never rolled my eyes Oh sweetie - you don’t have

at you.

to. You get the point across.

PETER
(suddenly defiant)
Okay. So say what you wanna say,
then.

STEVE
Peter--

ANNIE
(getting angry)
I don’t want _to say anything. I’ve
tried saying things.

 
58.

PETER
So try again. Release yourself.

ANNIE
Release you, you mean!

PETER
So fine, so release me! What do you
wanna say? Fuckin’ say it!

Annie explodes out of her seat.

ANNIE
Don't you swear at me - you little
shit! You don't EVER raise your voice
at me! I'm your Mother, you
understand? I've given everything to
you! All I ever DO is worry and slave
and defend you, and all I get back is
that fucking face on your face! So
full of disdain and resentment and
always so annoyed. Well, now your
sister's dead! And I know you miss
her and I know it was an “accident”
and I know you're in pain - and I
wish I could take it all away! I wish
I could shield you from the knowledge
that you did what you did - but your
sister is dead. She's gone forever.
And what a waste. If it could’ve
Maybe brought us together -
something! - if you could have just
said “I’m sorry” or faced up to what
happened: maybe then we could do
something with this! But you can’t
take responsibility for anything, so
now I_can’t accept. And I can’t
forgive. Because nobody admits what
they’ve done!

She sits down. A heavy silence.

Peter is looking away, fighting tears. But then, after a long
silence...

PETER
And what about you, mom?
(long pause, then)
I didn’t want to take her...and she
didn’t want to go... So why was she
there?

Annie looks at him. Incredulous. She is boiling with rage,
but...this has also hit her somewhere deep. She’s desperately
avoided facing this question since the accident.

STEVE
Okay, we’re stopping this.
91

Green Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 59.

He looks at Annie, who looks like she’s about to lose her
mind.

STEVE (CONT'D)
We’re stopping this right now.

Annie glowers at him. Adversarial. She finally relents.

ANNIE
Fine.

She tensely RISES hesitates, but then hesitates, about to say
something else. But then:

ANNIE (CONT'D)
Fine.

She leaves.

Steve turns to Peter: he’s doing everything in his power to
keep from exploding into tears. Steve looks powerless to help.

INT. ANNIE AND STEVE’S BEDROOM - MINUTES LATER 91

Steve enters the bedroom, furious. Annie is sitting on the
bed, a hardness in her eyes.

STEVE
What the hell are you doing?

ANNIE
What am I doing?!

STEVE
Try to stop and see what’s
happening, Annie. For one second.
Try to see where this could go.
It’s not the right choice.

ANNIE
These are your choices, too! You
choose to not see how he is. How
cold he is with me. How dimissive.

STEVE ANNIE (CONT'D)

So we'll deal with that! We

can go to family therapy s

whatever - but don’t make it Oh, family therapy! Right!
about Charlie!

ANNIE (CONT'D)
So what, then? We just chalk it up
to an act of God?

STEVE
(strongly)
Yes.
60.

ANNIE STEVE (CONT'D)
He just left her in the car! , .
Went straight to bed! Not a You can’t even imagine he was
word! in shock?
ANNIE

He left us to be in shock, too!

STEVE
There was no way around that. You
need to stop this. If he had warned
us, we still would have run out
there to find her in the same way.

ANNIE
(ignoring him)
And it wasn’t a fucking BBQ either.
He lied to us, through his teeth.
He took her to some sleazy high
school house party!

STEVE . ANNIE (CONT'D)
You knew it wasn’t a BBQ! He just left her head in the
road and kept driving. He
went to sleep!

STEVE
Goddamn it -- He was in shock. He's
still in shock.

ANNIE
(acidly)
He looks pretty gathered to me.
STEVE ANNIE (CONT'D)
Gathered?! You're holding yourself

together awfully well, too!

STEVE
Excuse me? And what the hell does
that mean?
(no answer)
Someone has to keep things from
unraveling completely, Annie.

ANNIE
(exploding)
It HAS unraveled completely!

Silence. Steve is frozen.
ANNIE (CONT'D)
...Don’t worry. I blame myself,
too.

STEVE
That’s worthless.
92

61.

 

ANNIE
I’m the one who made her go to the
party.
__. STEVE ANNIE (CONT'D)
Oh, stop it! No! Don’t you dare! He’s
right! I made Peter take her!
She begged me not to go!
STEVE

I was happy she was going! Be around
other kids instead of that fuckin’
treehouse for a change! I would have
pushed her if you hadn't!

ANNIE
But you didn’t push her. I did.

STEVE
...We have no control over
anything, Annie. The ceiling could
collapse on us right now and who
would we blame?

Brief pause.

ANNIE
You don’t understand anything, do
you?
INT. PETER’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 92

Peter boils in bed, staring out the window.

A gentle knock at the door. It cracks open and Steve sticks
his head in.

STEVE
Goodnight, Petey.

Peter looks at Steve.

PETER
Do you blame me, too?

STEVE
Goddamn it -

Steve opens the door all the way.

STEVE (CONT'D)
- of course not. No one blames you.

Steve approaches Peter.
62.

STEVE (CONT'D)
I don’t for one second imagine that
you're not going through the exact
same thing we are.

PETER
Mom doesn’t think so.

STEVE
Stop it with mom. She’s blaming
everyone. It’s part of grieving.
She blames herself.

Peter has started to cry.

PETER
She wasn't driving the car.

STEVE
She could have. Anyone could have.

PETER
(through helpless tears)
I didn’t even care about her...!
That’s how it happened...!

Steve is momentarily overwhelmed.

STEVE
(weakly)
You love your sister.

PETER
(boiling with self-
hatred)
I_should be dead. At least she
could draw. She made things. I
don’t do anything.

STEVE
Yes you do. Don’t ever say that.
PETER
(burying his face in his
pillow)

I’m nothing. I do nothing.

Steve, looking helpless, rests his hand on Peter’s head.
Peter WEEPS. Steve is also crying now.

PETER (CONT'D)
(into his pillow)
I’m sorry!

STEVE
Shhh! I’m sorry.
93

94

95

63.

INT. ANNIE & STEVE’S BEDROOM - SAME TIME 93

Annie lies on the bed, her back to us. We hear Peter’s
weeping, muffled through the walls. We then hear:

ANNIE
(barely audible)
I’m sorry.

Annie’s back begins to rise and fall in a fit of sobs.

FADE TO BLACK

INT. WORKSHOP - DAY - DAYS LATER 94
CLOSE-UP of Annie’s face. Lethargic. She’s lost a few pounds
since we last saw her, and is wearing an old T-shirt and

pajama bottoms.

She stares at her unfinished miniatures. Her eyes then drift
to a Post-It note above her desk. It reads “KEEP WORKING!"

INT. ART SUPPLY STORE - DAY 95

Annie pushes a cart down an aisle of miniature building
materials. She looks farther down the aisle, and suddenly
STOPS, having noticed...

JOAN is pushing a cart toward Annie. She hasn’t yet noticed
Annie. She wears an ECSTATIC SMILE as she giddily scans the
chalk section.

Confused by Joan’s demeanor (and her presence), Annie warily
begins to push her cart toward her.

ANNIE
Joan?

Joan looks up to see Annie.

JOAN
Oh my -- Annie?!

ANNIE
Hi...!

Joan circles the carts to give Annie a big, warm, very
sustained HUG.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
Are you okay?

JOAN
(beaming)

Oh Annie. Yes. I’m really good. I’m
really really...
64.

Annie nods, forcing a smile. She looks concerned for Joan's
sanity.

JOAN (CONT'D)
Something happened, Annie. I feel
completely - turned around.

ANNIE
What happened?

JOAN
(laughing)
I don’t know if I should even say!

ANNIE
(laughing now, too)
What do you mean?

JOAN
You’re gonna think I’m crazy!
ANNIE
Not at all...!
JOAN
I... Oh God. I...
(confidentially

..-met a spiritual medium.
Annie affects a patronizing “Oh Wow” expression.

JOAN (CONT'D)
(explaining)
They were performing an open seance
-- and I know: I know what you’re
thinking, but they asked me to
attend. They were bringing in
skeptics and scientists so they
wouldn’t be accused of fraud. But I
went, fully skeptical, and what I
experienced there was truly...

Joan tries to think of a suitably ecstatic adjective.

ANNIE
An “open seance”?

JOAN
They brought back the spirit of a man
from the 19th century! And not like
as a smoke and mirrors thing. The man
next to me was a deadly cynical
neurologist, and he looked
permanently changed by the end of it.

Annie makes another “wow” face.
96

65.

JOAN (CONT'D)

And I do know what you’re thinking,
Annie - of course - but I
approached the medium and I asked
her about my son and grandson, and
she came to my apartment and she
ended up performing a, uh - well -
she...conjured my grandson!

Annie, still forcing a smile, now looks frightened.
JOAN (CONT'D)
I know what you’re smiling at. I
wouldn't believe it myself. I
didn’t! But I heard his voice, I
felt him in the room. It’s real.
Annie’s warped smile is plastered appeasingly to her face.

JOAN (CONT'D)
What are you doing right now?

ANNIE
I’m just - here, shopping.

JOAN
You wanna come over?

Annie doesn’t know what to say.
JOAN (CONT'D)
I really think you should. Please.
It would be everything if you came.
INT. JOAN’S APARTMENT - DAY 96

The front door opens and Joan enters, followed uneasily by
Annie. Joan smiles widely.

JOAN
Hello!

This “hello” was seemingly directed at the room in general.
Joan hustles to the KITCHEN. She takes SWEETGRASS and smears
it across the surface of the kitchen table. Also on the table
is an UPTURNED DRINKING GLASS.
JOAN (CONT'D)
(to Annie)

This is part of it.

Annie is hovering outside the kitchen.

JOAN (CONT'D)
Come in. Come in.
66.

Annie hesitantly enters. The WINDOW has been blacked out with

duvateen.

JOAN (CONT'D)

Okay: a few things. First: you
shouldn't do this without a medium
unless you are a medium. That’s
what she told me.

ANNIE
Okay.

JOAN
But I told you: I’d been
experiencing these...sensations a
long time before the medium. I just
didn’t know how to explain them! So
I tried this last night. This was
after the medium was here.

ANNIE
What's “this”?

JOAN
Sit down.

Annie is skeptical.

JOAN (CONT'D)
Trust me.

Annie sits down.

JOAN (CONT'D)
I’m turning off the light.

JOAN TURNS OFF THE LIGHTS.

JOAN (CONT'D)
You okay?

ANNIE
.--Yes.

Joan lights a BLACK CANDLE.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
(forcing levity)
Nice mood setter.

JOAN
Okay. Put your hand on the glass,
but don’t add pressure.

Annie lays her hand on the overturned glass. Joan does the

same.
67.

JOAN (CONT'D)
I won’t add pressure, either.

ANNIE
(more to herself)
What am I doing?

After a moment of silence, Joan speaks to the room.

JOAN
Louie?

Beat.

JOAN (CONT'D)
Louie, are you here? It’s grandma.

A COLD DRAFT crosses the room. Annie gets a tingle. But the
window is shut, as is the door.

JOAN (CONT'D)
Louie, if you’re here with us,
please just try to slide the glass.
(pause)
Louie, if you’re here--

The glass SLIDES, barely. Annie jumps, retracting her hand.

JOAN (CONT'D)
(tears of happiness)
Hi Louie!

ANNIE
(eyes wide)
How did you do that?

Annie looks under the table. There’s nothing there.

JOAN

(continuing)
Louie, I’m gonna ask you some
questions - okay, sweetie? If the
answer's yes, just slide the glass
to the right. If it’s no, slide it
this way -—

(demonstrating)
- to the left. Do you understand?

The glass SLIDES again, slightly to the right.

ANNIE
Oh my God.

JOAN
Louie, are you okay?

The glass slides right again.
68.
JOAN (CONT'D)
Are you in pain?
The glass slides to the left.

Annie is gripping her chair. She stares unblinkingly at the
glass.

Suddenly ANNIE’S HAIR IS BRUSHED TO THE SIDE, as if by an
invisible hand. She JUMPS. Joan calmly takes Annie’s hand.

JOAN (CONT'D)

It’s okay.
ANNIE
(frightened)
What is?

Joan pulls up a small CHALKBOARD from below the table. It’s
unmarked. A tiny piece of chalk rests on the surface.

JOAN
Louie, I brought your chalkboard.
Remember your chalkboard?
The glass budges slightly to the right.

JOAN (CONT'D)
Can you write something?

A long moment of inactivity, and THEN...

The piece of chalk MOVES (as if by invisible fingers) to
scrawl the words “I LOV YU GRANMA” in a young child's
handwriting!

JOAN (CONT'D)
Oh Louie, I love you, sweetheart!

Joan is crying tears of joy.

ANNIE

I’m sorry, can we stop?
JOAN

What?
ANNIE

I’m sorry. Please.

JOAN
(to the room)
Louie, we're gonna stop for a
second, but I’m coming right back!

Joan jumps up and turns on the lights. Annie looks rattled.
69.

JOAN (CONT'D)
Are you okay?

ANNIE
(shaken)
I’m sorry, I’m really...

JOAN
I understand. That’s how I reacted
at first.
ANNIE
I think I need to go.
JOAN ANNIE (CONT'D)
That’s okay. Thank you. I’m sorry.

Annie RISES. Joan blows out the candle, grabs it, and
shuffles to the kitchen to fetch a sheet of paper. It
features a Sanskrit prayer (transcribed in carefully
handwritten English).

Joan returns to Annie with the paper and the black candle.

JOAN

Here:

(handing them to her)
If you wanna try this yourself,
light the candle and choose one
item that belonged to your daughter
- that’1l be your link to her. Mine
was the chalkboard. That’s my link.
And then, when you’re ready -

(seriously, re: the

paper)
- read this out loud - every
syllable - very carefully.

ANNIE
(overwhelmed)
Why? What is it?

JOAN
I don’t know what language it is.
The medium had me read it, too.
It’s to make it start. But your
whole family - everyone needs to be
in the room. Your son. Everyone.

Annie uneasily accepts the articles and then turns to leave.
As she walks toward the door:

JOAN (CONT'D)
You didn’t kill her, Annie.

Annie turns sharply to Joan.
97

Green Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 70.
ANNIE
What?

JOAN
She isn’t gone.

ANNIE
I didn’t kill her!

Joan smiles warmly. “I know.”

ANNIE (CONT'D)
Okay. Thank you.

Annie leaves, trembling.
INT. CAR (MOVING) - EVENING 97

A discombobulated Annie drives back home. Her eyes are
buzzing and her movements are jerky and ill-possessed.

She slows to a stop at a red light.

As she sits waiting for the light to change, Annie hears a
CLICKING SOUND in the back seat. She goes white. She slowly
turns to look at the empty back seat. The clicking has
ceased.

Annie's eyes are crazed.

EXT. GRAHAM HOUSE - NIGHT 98
A wide shot of the house. Bathed in the pale moonlight, it
almost looks like one of Annie’s miniatures. All the lights
are off, save for ONE window.

INT. ANNIE & STEVE’S BEDROOM - SAME TIME 99
Steve is fast asleep. Annie’s side of the bed is EMPTY.

The door to the MASTER BATHROOM is closed, but a band of

light is visible beneath the door. Behind the door, Annie is
heard WHISPERING intensely - presumably on the phone.

ANNIE (0.S.)
Can it be anything?... Like her
clothes?
INT. PETER’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 100

CLOSE UP on Peter’s profile. He’s asleep.

Off-screen, the door is heard CREAKING OPEN. After a moment,
Annie leans into frame, hovering over Peter.
71.

ANNIE
(whispering)
Peter.

Peter doesn’t stir.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
Sweetheart. Peter. Wake up.

Peter inhales sharply. He wakes with a start.

PETER
What?

ANNIE
It’s okay, honey, it’s me.

Peter is still getting oriented. Annie looks strangely
hopeful.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
I’m so, so sorry for everything.
Please, please forgive me. I can’t
stand the things I said.

PETER
It’s okay.

Annie bends over to envelop him in a hug.
ANNIE

Can you get up, sweetheart? We’re
gonna try something.

PETER
I was just having a nightmare.
ANNIE
That’s okay, baby. We can do
something.
PETER
Do what?
ANNIE

I’ve figured it out.
101 INT. ANNIE & STEVE’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER 101
Annie stands over Steve, who’s asleep in bed.

ANNIE
Steve. Baby.

She nudges him gently.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
Steve. Wake up.
102

103

Green Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 72.

Steve jolts awake.

STEVE
What's going on?

ANNIE
Come downstairs with us. We’re
gonna do something together.

Steve looks to the door. Peter is standing nervously in the
unlit hallway.

INT. STAIRWAY - MOMENTS LATER 102

Annie walks down the hall. Steve and Peter follow warily
behind.

PETER
(whispering)
Dad?
STEVE
(whispering)
It’s okay.

Annie leads them to the unlit DINING ROOM...
INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 103

The oval dining table has been set with an upturned DRINKING
GLASS. Beside it is CHARLIE’S DRAWING PAD and one of
Charlie’s hoodies. The BLACK CANDLE that Joan gave Annie is
dimly illuminating the table. The WINDOW is open, and it is
COLD. Peter hugs himself; Steve rubs his arms.

STEVE
It's freezing.

Steve goes for the window.
ANNIE
No: Don’t change anything. I don’t
want to mess it up.
Annie sits down. There is a chair on either side of her.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
Everyone sit.

They don’t.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
My friend Joan taught me how to do
this.

STEVE
What friend Joan? And what's
“this”?
73.

ANNIE
Please sit. We need our palms on
the table and our fingers to touch.

STEVE ANNIE (CONT'D)
What are we doing, Annie? Please. You’ll see.

Steve just looks at her.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
Please just trust me.

Steve doesn’t budge.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
Fine!

Annie stands up, DRAGS the table halfway towards Steve and
Peter, and GRABS their hands.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
We can do it here, then.

She SQUEEZES their hands.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
I need you both to concentrate.

PETER
On what?
ANNIE
pause)

Think about Charlie if you can.

STEVE
(stern)
Annie!

Steve pulls his hand away from Annie.

ANNIE
(urgent)
Sweetheart, please. Please. I tried
this twenty minutes ago and it
worked. I wouldn't be bringing you
down here if it didn’t.

STEVE
What worked?

ANNIE
(pause)
I wanna just show you.

STEVE
Show us what?!
74.

ANNIE
(frustrated)
Fuck! I’m a - medium!

Before Steve can protest:

ANNIE (CONT'D)
I was seeing apparitions earlier. I
just shook them off, but I
shouldn’t have.

(gripping his hand)
Please: I know how it sounds.
There’s no way to talk about it, I
need to just show you. Okay?
Please. You'll see. I’m completely
lucid.

Steve just stares at her. She looks pleadingly at him.

STEVE ANNIE (CONT'D)
(to Peter)
You_can go to bed, Peter.
I‘1l stay. What? No. What are you doing?
(to Peter)

Peter: please. This needs all
of our energies. We need to
do this as a family.
Together.

PETER
(to Steve)
It’s okay, Dad. I'll stay.

ANNIE
(to Steve)
Please Steve. I need you to be
open. Both of you. I promise.

She holds out her hand, pleading for Steve’s. He reluctantly
obliges. Again, she SQUEEZES both of their hands.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
Okay, good. So I already read that
earlier...

Annie nods to the prayer sheet that Joan gave her.
ANNIE (CONT'D)

I don’t think I need to read it

again.
Steve squints as he looks it over.

STEVE ANNIE (CONT'D)
What language is that? (back to business)
Okay: Try to concentrate.

Annie now addresses the room.
75.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
Charlie?... Charlie, are you here?

Steve looks ready to put an immediate stop to this, but he
sees Annie’s total determination. He holds off.

In the other room, a door is heard CREAKING. Peter looks in
that direction.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
Charlie? It’s mommy. And daddy. And
Peter.

Silence. Peter and Steve are very uneasy.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
Charlie, if you’re in this room
with us -- I’m going to have us all
touch this glass.

Annie has PULLED Steve and Peter to the table. She rests her
palm on top of the glass. She takes Steve’s hand and Peter’s
hand. She lays them on top of hers.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
(to Steve and Peter)
Don’t add pressure.
(to the room)
Now if you're here, Charlie, I just
want you to move the glass for us.
Even if it’s just a tiny little

bit.
STEVE ANNIE (CONT'D)
(needing to interject) (ignoring Steve)
Annie. Even if it’s just the tiniest

little movement, Charlie!

A long stretch of nothing. Annie’s determination has not
waned. Peter suddenly TENSES UP.

PETER
(to Steve)
What the hell?

STEVE
What’s wrong?

Max BARKS in the other room.

PETER
You don’t feel that?

STEVE
What??

PETER

Like a - flexing. In the air.
76.

THE DRINKING GLASS SUDDENLY MOVES.

Peter and Steve retract their hands.

STEVE ANNIE
What the hell? Wow! Yes! Thank you, Charlie!
That was so good!

The color has drained from Peter's face.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
Now Charlie, what I’d like for you
to do is I’d like for youto...

Annie opens the DRAWING PAD. She flips it to a blank page,
and lays a small piece of PENCIL LEAD on top.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
.-.-show them what you were doing
earlier.

Pause.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
(to the room)

Can you show them what you just did

for me?

PETER
Mom.

Intensely focused, Annie points to the pad.

ANNIE
Look: She’s gonna do it.

Peter looks to the pad, terrified. Steve SEES Peter’s fear.
Steve SHUTS the drawing pad.

STEVE
That’s enough.

ANNIE
What? No!

Annie grabs the pad and flips to a PAGE near the back. It is
a simple DRAWING - in Charlie’s style - of a CAR. She holds
it up for Steve.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
When I did this earlier, this
materialized on the page! I saw
this draw itself! I saw it!

PETER
Mom, what is this?
77.

ANNIE
IT’S CHARLIE!

STEVE
ANNIE-—

Cutting Steve off, Annie continues addressing the room.

ANNIE
Did you finish, Charlie?! Did you
want to draw more?

She returns the drawing pad (now open to the car drawing) to
the center of the table.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
You can keep going if you weren’t
finished!

Annie GRABS Steve’s and Peter’s hand, and presses them
against the table again. She pushes her hands on top of
theirs.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
We need to keep our fingers
touching. We need to give good
energy.

Steve PULLS his hand away. Peter does, too. Annie SEIZES
Peter's wrist.

STEVE ANNIE (CONT'D)
This is SCARING him, Annie! No it’s NoT!

ANNIE (CONT'D)
(to Peter)
Don't be scared, Peter. This is
your sister.
(to the room)
Charlie? Are you finished with the
drawing?

Silence. Suddenly an intense GUST OF AIR sweeps the room
(from the open window?) and the DOOR SLAMS SHUT. Max is now
BARKING like crazy in the other room.

PETER
Mom? ! (very scared)
lom? !

ANNIE
(to the room)
Charlie? What’s wrong?

The air seems to be sucked out of the room for a moment. The
family is suspended in frightened anticipation. And then --
78.

THE CANDLE’S FLAME BELCHES, as if fueled (for an instant) by
propane. Everyone GASPS! The flame is immediately
extinguished.

Silence now - save for Max, still barking in the other room.
We are left for a moment in darkness, and then...

The candle’s wick quietly RE-IGNITES on its own. The flame now
burns normally. Peter and Steve stare open-mouthed at this.

Steve looks under the table. Nothing is there. He warily
lifts the candle to see if there’s anything attached to the
bottom. There is not. Before Steve can react --

A FAINT GROANING SOUND is ushered. Peter and Steve, frozen for
a moment, look nervously to the source. It’s coming from...

ANNIE. Her head is down. She’s moaning, as if trying to
vomit. She’s in some sort of TRANCE. Finally, she lets outa
LONG, PAINED GROAN. Guttural and almost inhuman-sounding. It
drags out longer than wanted. And then...

Annie stops. Her eyes are WIDE. Like a child’s. She then says:

ANNIE (CONT'D)
Hello?

But her voice sounds different. It will now remind us - in
inflection, in quality - of CHARLIE’S VOICE.

PETER
(horrified)
Mom?
ANNIE
(like Charlie)
Mom?

Annie looks around, as if looking for “Mom.” She looks very
scared now (but she’s still squeezing Peter’s wrist).

ANNIE (CONT'D)
(like Charlie)

Mom?!
PETER ANNIE (CONT'D)
(to Steve) (like Charlie)
I don’t like this. What’s happening?!
PETER
(to Steve)

Dad! I don’t like this!

STEVE
(also afraid)
Annie...
79.

ANNIE
(like Charlie)
What’s going on?!

Annie is still looking around, as if she can’t see. Asif
she’s BLIND.

PETER
(crying)
Mommy? !

Annie is crying now, too.

ANNIE
(like Charlie)
Mom? ?

Mortified, Peter tugs on Steve’s arm.
PETER STEVE

Please, dad! (helpless)
ANNIE! STOP IT!

ANNIE
(like Charlie)
What’s happening?! Why is everyone
scared?!

Terrified silence.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
(like Charlie)
WHY ARE YOU SCARING ME?!

More terrified silence.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
(like Charlie)
Dad! Peter! I’m scared! Where’s
mom? !

PETER
can’t take anymore
'Y!
DAD!

Steve runs to TURN ON THE LIGHTS. Annie is still possessed,
looking blindly about the room.

Steve runs out of the room to go to the KITCHEN.

We stay with Annie and Peter.

ANNIE PETER (CONT'D)
(like Charlie)
Peter, what’s going on?
Where’s mom? Stop it!

ANNIE
(like a scared animal)
Why are you trying to scare me?!
104

80.

Steve re-enters the room, holding a GLASS OF WATER. He TOSSES
it in Annie’s face. She GASPS - roused from her trance.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
What the hell! What are you doing?!

Annie is frozen. She takes in her drenched body. Max has
stopped barking in the other room.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
What just happened?

Peter and Steve are traumatized.
EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT 104

Steve has pulled Annie outside. He’s very aggressive. Annie
has wiped the water off her face with a towel. In the b.g.,
Peter watches from a window.

STEVE ANNIE
What the fuck did you just
do? I didn’t do anything!

STEVE
I swear to God, Annie--

ANNIE
You were there. You saw what
happened. That wasn’t me.

A fraught beat. Steve stares daggers.

STEVE

What was that, Annie?
ANNIE

We communicated with Charlie.

. STEVE ANNIE (CONT'D)
(meaning it)
Stop it. You saw that we did!

STEVE

Did you happen to see your son in
there? Did you even notice that
he’s absolutely terrified?!

ANNIE
Are you sure you’re not terrified?

STEVE
I am terrified! I’m fuckin’ scared
of you.

(definitively)

Tomorrow. We’re going to see Dr.
Stetson.

Annie's eyes go cold with recognition.
81.

ANNIE
I don’t wanna see Dr. Stetson.

STEVE
Well, I don’t wanna be conducting
seances in my fucking dining room!
Steve storms inside. Annie follows him. She boils.
ANNIE
Goddamn it! Denial can be a crazy
thing, too, Steve! To be so rigid!
But Steve keeps walking off.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
HEY!

Steve pauses, also boiling.
ANNIE (CONT'D)
What happened when I blacked out?
Did something happen?
Steve just looks at her.
105 INT. ANNIE AND STEVE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 105

The moonlight is an icy blue.

Annie and Steve are in bed. Steve is asleep with his back to
Annie. Annie is too anxious to sleep.

She turns her face into her pillow, only to notice TWO ANTS
crawling on the pillowcase. She looks down to see THREE MORE
ANTS on the bed. She then pulls ONE ANT off of her shoulder.

Annie sits up. She looks down to see a TRAIL OF ANTS on the
floor, leading into the hallway. The trail is coming from the
WINDOW.

Annie gets out of bed and checks the window. It’s locked. But
the trail seems to be COMING IN through a small gap in the
corner of the sill.

Annie follows the trail of black ants out of the room and
into the hallway...

106 INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 106
The trail of ants is leading clearly to PETER’S BEDROOM. His
door is open. (There is the faint sound of Max’s barking, as
if heard from a great distance.)

107 INT. PETER’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 107

Annie enters Peter’s bedroom. The queue of ants continues
toward Peter’s bed.
Green Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 82.

They crawl up the bed post and onto the mattress, continuing
up Peter’s leg and across his body - all the way up to his
neck.

Annie draws closer. As she approaches, it becomes horribly
apparent...

THE BLACK ANTS HAVE COMPLETELY ENVELOPED PETER’S HEAD AND
FACE.

PETER (V.O.)
Mom! What are you doing?!

CLOSE-UP OF ANNIE’S FACE. Her expression goes from horrified
to confused. She looks up, unnerved, and takes in her
surroundings. We cut WIDE to reveal:

Annie is standing in Peter’s dark room, but Peter is now
sitting up in bed. There are no ants. It was all a dream?

ANNIE
What's going on?

PETER
You were sleepwalking.

There is no audible room tone and the dialogue is strangely
CRISP, as though being spoken in a dreamy vacuum. The only
other sound is Max's distant BARKING.

Annie looks extremely confused and afraid.

ANNIE
I’m sorry...

Annie looks around.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
Is Charlie here?

PETER
Why are you scared of me?

ANNIE
(looking at him now)
What?

Annie's expression pleads “How could you ask me that?” But
Peter just stares back at her. Annie’s attitude suddenly
TURNS - from defensive to confessional. She admits:

ANNIE (CONT'D)
I never wanted to be your mother.

Annie covers her mouth, as if in shock at her own words. She
looks to Peter like a child who just accidentally broke
something.
Green Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 83.

PETER
(emotional)

Why not?
ANNIE

(still covering mouth)
I was scared. I didn’t feel like a
mother. But she pressured me.

PETER
Then why did you have me?
ANNIE
It’s not my fault...! I tried to
stop it.
PETER
How?
ANNIE

(barely able to say it)
...I tried to have a miscarriage.

Peter starts tearing up.

PETER
How?
ANNIE
(also tearing up)
However I could...! I did

everything they told me not to. But
it didn't work. I’m happy it didn’t
work!

Max's muffled barking has become faintly more distinct. Peter
is crying hard now.

PETER
You tried to kill me?

Annie, also crying, shakes her head.

ANNIE
I love you.

We cut back to Peter, but his hair and face are now
inexplicably DRENCHED in liquid (presumably paint thinner).

PETER
Why did you try to kill me?

We cut back to Annie, revealing that she's now drenched in
paint thinner, too.

ANNIE
I didn’t. I was trying to save you.

Green Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 84.
An OFF-SCREEN FIRE IGNITES, illuminating Annie’s face in
hellish orange.
MAX'S OFF-SCREEN BARKING HAS NOW BECOME VERY LOUD, VERY
PRESENT. It reaches an almost unbearable pitch before we CUT
TO:
INT. ANNIE & STEVE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 108
ANNIE WAKES UP WITH A START. It was all a dream.
Max is barking wildly in the hallway.
A FLY lands on Annie’s face. Brushing it away, she notices
that Steve’s side of the bed is EMPTY. His pillow is also
GONE.
INT. PETER’S BEDROOM - SAME TIME 109

Max's barking persists in the b.g.

The lights are on. Peter, dressed in his pajamas, sits
traumatized on the edge of his bed.

The composition of this shot (wide, high-angle) is MATCHED
eerily on the CUT TO:

INT. CLASSROOM - NEXT DAY 110
Peter sits tensely in the back corner of his classroom.

The teacher stands at the blackboard, leading the class
through an algebra lesson.

Peter’s mind is a storm. He’s brought fiercely into the
present, however, when a strange, barely perceptible glint of
LIGHT (we've seen this before) FLASHES across the room. The
light ends at the WINDOW next to Peter.

Peter looks around. Nobody else noticed it. Peter blinks a
few times, concerned that he might be seeing things. He turns
back to the window to see...

Peter’s REFLECTION is staring pointedly back at him.

The color drains from Peter’s face. He looks weakly back at
his own reflection, whose eyes HARDEN bitterly against him.

Overwhelmed, Peter abruptly STANDS UP, distracting the
teacher.

TEACHER
Yes, Peter?

PETER
(confused)
I - have to go to the bathroom.
112

Green Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 85.
Aware of Peter’s recent trauma, the Teacher is careful to be
extra-sensitive.

TEACHER
That’s fine. Just take the pass.

Peter leaves, tears in his eyes.

INT. STEVE’S OFFICE - DAY 111
Steve sits stiffly at the computer in his office. He has
typed into his search engine “Paranormal evidence, voice
channeling,” but he pauses and then DELETES this. He instead
writes “Symptomatology and management of grief
hallucinations.” He presses SEND.

Steve looks over the results, and then clicks on a separate
tab. It’s a half-composed EMAIL to a fellow psychiatrist. The
email reads...

Hi Bob,

I hesitate to write, but I’m worried that Annie might be on
the verge of (or in the MIDDLE of)

He’s stuck on how to continue.

Steve’s cell phone rings. It’s an unknown number. He
hesitates before answering it.

STEVE
Hello?

There’s a strange wave of STATIC and then...

PETER (V.O.)
(almost whispering)
Dad?
STEVE
Peter?

We can hear that Peter is crying, near hysteria.

PETER (V.O.)
Something’s at the school.
; STEVE PETER (V.0.)
What is? It followed me here!
INT. ANNIE’S WORKSHOP - SAME TIME 112

The cordless PHONE is ringing. Two FLIES crawl across it.

Annie, still wearing her nightgown, nervously works on a
FUNERAL HOME model. The ringing STOPS, but then starts again.
Annie now turns to ANSWER the phone.
86.

ANNIE

Hello?

Steve is on the other end. We can hear that he is DRIVING.
STEVE (V.O.)
(furious)
Can you guess who just called me
from school in complete hysterics?

Annie goes pale.

ANNIE
(gravely)

Charlie?

STEVE (V.O.)
...What?

ANNIE
I -- nothing. What happened?

STEVE (V.O.)

Peter just called me, Annie.
Terrified. Crying in the halls.
He’s convinced he’s being
threatened by some vengeful spirit.

ANNIE
Why does he think he’s being
threatened?

STEVE (V.O.)

(no patience)
Listen to me, Annie: I have a son
to protect.

ANNIE
What does that mean?

STEVE (V.O.)
It means that’s what I’m worried
about right now. That’s how I’m

proceeding.

ANNIE
Don’t talk to me like this. He’s my
son, too.

CLICK. He’s hung up.
Infuriated, Annie calls Steve back. He answers.
ANNIE (CONT'D)
Don’t hang up on me again. I’m not
sleepwalking anymore, you understand?

She hangs up.
113

Green Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 87.

Annie returns to the miniature funeral home. She carefully
(but tensely) presses a freshly GLUED piece of balsa wood
against the beautifully rendered wall. She holds it in place.

The phone RINGS. Annie doesn’t care. It rings until the
ANSWERING MACHINE gets it. After the outgoing message, the
machine BEEPS and a WOMAN leaves a message.

WOMAN (V.O.)

Hi Annie! It’s Margaret at the Asher
Gallery. I’m just calling to see how
things are with you and your family -
I hope everything’s okay — and also,
just wondering, uh, how the progress
is going. Not that you need reminding
- haha - but we are a little less
than nine weeks away, so it would
just be nice to get the vaguest sense
of where we are. So yeah, call me
back whenever, and again, I really
hope everything’s okay and our
thoughts are all very much with your
family, so - Okay. Thanks so much.

Click. BEEP.

Annie has grown extremely TENSE over the course of that
message. Still applying pressure to the glued-on piece, she
pushes a little too hard, and her thumb BREAKS THROUGH the
miniature’s wall.

Annie FREEZES for a moment, shocked. Then, overcome by sheer
frustration, she raises her FIST and SMASHES IT DOWN into the
funeral home’s floor, SNAPPING it.

Taken by a surge of destructive rage, she SWEEPS the
miniature off the table and rises to STOMP her foot through
its roof. DESTROYING IT.

Without missing a beat, she grabs a HAMMER and proceeds to
SMASH APART the rest of her miniatures. It’s a woeful,
devastating fit. By the time Annie gets a grip on herself,
it’s too late. All of the pieces have been destroyed. All
except for one... The MINIATURE OF THE GRAHAM HOUSE.

Annie drops the hammer.

INT. FOYER - MOMENTS LATER 113

Steve and Peter enter through the front door. A bad SMELL
immediately hits them.

STEVE
Whoa. Jesus.

They proceed up the stairs. Steve swipes away a fly.
114

Green Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 88.

STEVE (CONT'D)
Did something die in here?

INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 114
Peter goes to his room, closing the door behind him.

Steve walks up to the WORKSHOP’s door. He opens it without
knocking.

STEVE
(entering)
Annie, what is that smell--

But he FREEZES when he sees the state of the demolished room.
Annie sits in her chair, completely surrounded by smashed and
splintered wood.

STEVE (CONT'D)
(stunned)
...What happened?

He looks at Annie and almost immediately understands. She did
this. His heart breaks.

ANNIE
I didn’t wanna look at it anymore.

Steve stares at her for a very long time. He then grabs the
PHONE and storms into the hallway, dialing a number.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
(rising)
Hey! Who are you calling?!

INT. HALLWAY - LATER

Through the upstairs hallway window, A CAR pulls up to park
behind Steve’s car. A pleasant, well scrubbed man (50s)
emerges to walk toward the house. This is DR. STETSON.

There is a KNOCK at the door. It is heard OPENING.

DR. STETSON (0.S.)
Hi Steve.

STEVE (0.S.)
Thanks for coming, Bob. Yeah:
forgive the smell. I think
something died in the walls.

Annie is standing in the upstairs hallway, listening.
STEVE (0.S.) (CONT'D)

(sighs)
She’s upstairs right now.
Green Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 89.

Annie takes this as her cue. She walks defiantly down the
stairs. She arrives at the bottom, in the FOYER. Dr. Stetson
acknowledges her with a big smile.

DR. STETSON
(warmly )
Hi Annie.

ANNIE
Dr. Stetson.

DR. STETSON
Can we all sit somewhere and talk?

ANNIE
(disdainful)
Yeah, let’s make ourselves at home.

Annie sits in a chair in the corner. Dr. Stetson takes a
chair and brings it nearer. Stetson sits across from Annie,

without crowding her. (A couple flies will be buzzing around
throughout.)

DR. STETSON
How's it going?

ANNIE
Not amazing.

DR. STETSON
Can you talk about why?

ANNIE
(blunt)
Uh - because my daughter was killed
and now my psychiatrist husband is
calling over his peers to
investigate me.

Steve glowers.

DR. STETSON
Nobody's investigating you, Annie.

Annie just stares at him.

DR. STETSON (CONT’D)
Can I ask how you are?

ANNIE
I'm fine. I’m lucid. I’m in
mourning and I’m trying to cope,
and he’s supposed to be my partner,
so forgive me if I’m not bouncing
off the walls to see you.
90.

DR. STETSON
Nobody's trying to do anything
against you right now, Annie. I
promise you.

ANNIE
Then stop patronizing me please.

Stetson takes a long pause. He levels with her:

DR. STETSON
What’s all this about ghosts? And
seances?

ANNIE
(direct)
I thought I felt a presence. I was
hopeful, as you can imagine. It was
fleeting, and now I’m back to
grieving.

DR. STETSON
Okay... All right.
(moving on)
And why did you destroy your work?

ANNIE
(turning back to
Stetson)
Because it’s my work.

Annie's eyes are stone. Brief pause.

LATER

DR. STETSON
(relenting)
Fair enough. So I’m gonna ask you
some annoying questions now, Annie.
(making sure to not
patronize)
I can see that you're lucid. This
is just simply what I have to do.
Okay?
(first question)
What day is it?

ANNIE
Tuesday.

DR. STETSON
When in the month?

115

Through the foyer window, we see Steve and Dr. Stetson
OUTSIDE. This is from Annie’s POV.

Dr. Stetson seems to be explaining something to Steve. Steve

nods,

frustrated.
116

91.

We see Dr. Stetson say “I’m sorry, I can’t” and then he walks
off to his car. Steve sulks back toward the house.

Steve enters. He looks at Annie.

ANNIE

What were you hoping? That I'd tell
your psychiatrist friend that we

brought back our dead daughter? You
think I don’t know how that sounds?

Steve nods, numb. He walks past her, toward the stairs. Annie

pauses before following him up.

INT. ANNIE’S WORKSHOP - MOMENTS LATER 116

Steve has entered the workshop. He walks heavily around the

ruins.
Annie steps in. Watches him.

STEVE

You worked so hard for this show.

ANNIE

Jesus Christ - Fuck the show.

You're ignoring this!

STEVE
I’m not ignoring anything -
believe me.

Long pause.

STEVE
(tensely, measuredly)
I won’t indulge this behavior
anymore.

STEVE
I won’t. I can’t allow it.

ANNIE (CONT'D)

You ignore everything! If you
can’t find it in one of your
books!

ANNIE (CONT'D)

“Indulge”?

ANNIE (CONT'D

“Allow” now! Jesus! Listen to
how you’re just clinging!
(pointing)
You’re the one who’s gonna go
crazy, Steve. If you keep
just denying what’s in front
of you.

Steve stares at her, overwhelmed. He looks down to notice at
his feet: the figurine of Annie’s Mother, holding out her
breast. Steve lets out a defeated sigh.

STEVE

(tears building)

You know, Annie...

Green Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 92.

STEVE (CONT'D)
You can still build a shrine to the
terrible stuff. Doesn’t mean you
have to destroy anything good.

ANNIE
Well, it’s not anything good. It’s
nothing. It means nothing. This -—
(kicks a piece of wood)
- is what I cared about.

STEVE
Except for that one.

Steve is pointing out the pristine Graham House replica. He
looks it over. Something makes him chuckle bitterly to
himself.

STEVE (CONT'D)
Nice touch.

Annie looks at Steve, not understanding. She walks over to
the miniature.

She sees that something has been ADDED to Peter’s bedroom. A
HEADLESS FIGURINE (now wearing Peter’s clothes) is lying in
Peter's bed. The color drains from Annie’s face.

STEVE (CONT'D)
I was wondering when Peter would
get switched with Charlie.

Annie is covering her mouth with her hands. She is having a
horrible revelation. Her eyes then SCAN UP to notice
something else...

The figurine of ANNIE (on her knees, face in her hands) is
now in the ATTIC replica. The figurine is dressed in a
NIGHTGOWN (the same one that Annie is wearing now), except
its front is covered in blood.

Defeated, Steve leaves the room.

ANNIE
Where are you going?

STEVE
(bitterly)
I didn’t sleep at all last night.
If you can believe it.

INT. LIVING ROOM - MINUTES LATER 117
Rattled and extremely tense, Steve sits at the couch, which

is dressed with a blanket and pillow. He uncaps a
PRESCRIPTION BOTTLE (sleeping pills).
118

120

Green Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 93.

STEVE
(mumbling)
Always you - right Steve? You hold
it all together.

He draws out TWO PILLS and knocks them back. He then
hesitates before pulling out one more. He DOWNS it.

INT. WORKSHOP - LATER THAT NIGHT 118

Through the open door of the workshop (whose lights are now
off), Peter is seen TURNING OFF THE LIGHTS in his bedroom. He
looks out into the hall, paranoid, and then shuts the door.
Several FLIES adorn the hallway walls.

This was seen from ANNIE’S POV. She’s sitting in the dark,
among the wreckage of her work. She’s still in shock over the
inexplicable additions to the Graham replica.

Suddenly she HEARS the faint sound of a PENCIL VIGOROUSLY
SCRATCHING PAPER. It’s coming from down the hall. She
hesitates before rising and entering the HALLWAY...

More and more flies have collected. They seem especially
prominent around the ATTIC DOOR on the ceiling.

Noting this, Annie continues to follow the sound of drawing
to arrive at...

INT. CHARLIE’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 119

The door is open. The lights are OFF. The sound of PENCIL
FEVERISHLY SCRATCHING PAPER is heard, although the room is
completely empty.

Annie stands at the door. She hesitates before turning on the
light.

CHARLIE’S DRAWING PAD rests on Charlie’s bed. It’s open to a
mostly blank page, but a DRAWING IS MATERIALIZING on it. It

is then FLIPPED (as if by wind) to the next page, where anew
drawing begins. We can’t yet see the content of the drawings.

Annie approaches the drawing pad to investigate. Her eyes,
already buzzing with fear, now widen with HORROR.

INT. PETER’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 120

The door is closed and the lights are off. Peter is inbed,
trying to sleep. Silence, save for a buzzing fly. Then...

A CLICKING of the tongue. Peter’s eyes OPEN. He slowly looks
up, scanning past the bed, to SEE...

CHARLIE is standing in the dark corner of the room (where
Peter mistook his hoodie for a person). Charlie stares at
Peter with unblinking eyes. It’s almost too dark to make her
out. Another CLICK.
121

122

123

Green Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 94.

PETER
Charlie?

A long silence. Charlie slowly opens her MOUTH, but then her
head DROOPS forward and rolls OFF her shoulders. It tumbles
to the floor and rolls toward Peter, but when it rolls intoa
block of moonlight (cast from the window), it’s revealed to
be a Nerf basketball.

Peter glares at the ball. A quiet GROWLING is heard from the
door. Peter looks up.

The door is now OPEN and Max stands in the doorway. He seems
to be disturbed by Peter - or rather, by something standing
behind Peter.
PETER (CONT'D)
(terrified)
What is it, Max?
Suddenly TWO HANDS materialize from behind Peter’s head. They
grab his face, grasping under his chin. They TUG BACK on his
head, as if trying to yank it off. Peter SCREAMS.
Max runs in to attack, but the DOOR SLAMS IN HIS FACE.
INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 121
Max paws aggressively at the door, barking wildly.
Suddenly, Max's HIND LEGS are lifted, as if by invisible
hands, and TUGGED back by a great, vacuuming force. He is
SUCKED across the hall and down the stairs. We FOLLOW the
mortified dog as it’s pulled all the way down to the FOYER.

The FRONT DOOR IS OPEN and Max is deposited violently out of
the house. The door SLAMS SHUT.

INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME 122
Steve is FAST ASLEEP on the couch.

ANNIE (0.S.)
Peter! Peter!

INT. PETER’S BEDROOM - SAME TIME 123

Peter has just been released by the phantom hands. He’s
frantic. ANNIE is now standing in the room.

ANNIE
What’s wrong, baby?! What
happened?!

PETER

What are you doing?!
124

95.

ANNIE
What do you mean?!

PETER
You were pulling on my head!

ANNIE
What?!

Peter looks terrified of her.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
No I wasn’t! I just came in! You
were screaming!

Peter is crying.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
What happened?

PETER
I saw Charlie in the corner and
then you started pulling on my
head.

ANNIE
Peter! I would never do that to
you! Are you crazy? I would never
hurt you. How could you even think
that?

Peter just stares at her through frightened tears.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
-..-You saw Charlie in what corner?

Peter can’t answer. He’s horrified.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
Listen to me, Peter. I don’t know
what’s happening or what you just
saw, but I’m stopping this. Do NOT
tell dad what you just said to me.
Please. It's NOT true. Something’s
going on, and I’m the only one who
can stop this. Do you understand?
I’m the only one who can fix it.

Peter stares unblinkingly at her.
INT. CHARLIE’S BEDROOM - SAME TIME 124

Charlie’s DRAWING PAD is open. We track slowly in, revealing
the CONTENT of two of the drawings...

Both are crude, violently drawn sketches of PETER’S FACE, but
the EYES are replaced with X’s. The faces are framed by
furiously sketched TRIANGLES.
125

126

127

Green Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 96.

A BREEZE blows in from the window, flipping to the NEXT PAGE -—
more of the same - and then the next page - still more of the
same - and then the next page, etc...

Annie’s HAND enters to seize the drawing pad. She leaves the
room.

Max's barking persists in the b.g.
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 125

Annie has started a FIRE in the fireplace. (In theb.g.,
Steve is still asleep on the couch.)

Annie clutches Charlie’s drawing pad, gazing into the fire.
She inhales deeply, holds her breath, and then THROWS the pad
in. At first it resists the flames, but then, the EDGE of one
sheet begins to BURN.

Annie watches this, eyes glued to the fire. But the shoulder
of her SHIRT has sprouted the tiny beginning of a FLAME. It
is the same size as the burgeoning flame at the drawing pad’s
edge. Annie doesn’t even notice.

The flame spreads slowly along the drawing pad’s edge. As
this happens, the flame on Annie’s shoulder SPREADS ALONG HER
ARM. Annie notices this and panics. She desperately tries to
stamp out the fire, but it’s no use.

The fireplace-fire starts to CONSUME the edges of the drawing
pad. Simultaneously, ANNIE’S ARM IS ENGULFED FOR A MOMENT IN
FLAMES. The fire on her arm is mimicking the fire that’s
eating the book.

Annie SCREAMS, pulls the drawing pad out of the fire, and
STAMPS OUT the flames. As she stamps it out, the fire on her
arm is duly EXTINGUISHED.

Annie understands now. She’s tied to the book.
EXT. GRAHAM HOUSE - NIGHT 126

The MOON hangs large over the house. We then SLAM CUT to
MORNING. The moon has been replaced by a shrill SUN.

INT. HALLWAY - MORNING 127

Peter steps out of his bedroom, backpack slung over his
shoulder. He clearly didn’t sleep last night and his eyes are
buzzing with anxiety. He looks down the hall at the
workshop’s DOOR, which is open by the faintest CRACK. He
hesitates and walks off.

Behind the workshop door: ANNIE stares through the crack,
making sure that Peter leaves.
Green Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 97.

128 INT. JOAN’S APARTMENT BUILDING - THIRD FLOOR - MOMENTS LATIEDRS

Annie, looking frighteningly determined, emerges from the
elevator of JOAN’S BUILDING. She’s still wearing her
nightgown under a coat. She rushes to JOAN’S DOOR and knocks.

No answer.
Annie knocks again, more urgently.
129 INT. JOAN’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 129

Nobody's home. We are pulling back from the DOOR (as Annie’s
knocking persists) to REVEAL the apartment...

It looks mostly the same, but it’s now adorned in cloths and
drapes that feature various SYMBOLS. One of these is an
ORNATE SIGIL (which we recognize as the one on Annie’s
necklace). This is the Sigil of PAIMON, and it can now be
found all over the room.

The TABLE at which Annie and Joan performed the seance (which
was then covered in a table-cloth) is now bare, revealing
that the tabletop has a LARGE TRIANGLE carved into it
(pointing to the northwest). Resting in the middle of the
triangle is a PHOTO OF PETER. Beside this is an ATHAME
(ritual dagger), a scattering of herbs, and finally...

A primitive DIORAMA (the same that we saw earlier on
Charlie’s desk, but now finished). Standing center stage is a
crude manikin of a human torso whose head is an actual
SEVERED RAVEN HEAD. Atop the head is an aluminum-foil CROWN.
Three other sculptures BOW ON THEIR KNEES to the raven-headed
figure. Their heads are the severed PIGEON HEAD (now
decomposing), a severed RAT HEAD and a severed SQUIRREL HEAD.

Annie's knocking continues.
130 INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 130

Annie ceases knocking. She looks DOWN to notice that she’s
standing on...

The WELCOME MAT. “JOANIE.”

Annie's mind starts racing. She thinks for a moment and then -
it hits her! Annie RACES back to the elevator.

A SCHOOL BELL RINGS, bridging our CUT TO:
131 EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - DAY 131

LUNCH TIME. It’s overcast, dark and windy. Students mill
about in flapping clothes.

Just beyond the high school fence is a ROAD with heavy
traffic. PETER is seated at an empty table near the fence,
eating (or rather, not eating) the cafeteria food.
132

Green Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 98.

The TRAFFIC NOISE is loud and imposing. Peter LISTENS to it,
losing himself in the white noise. But there’s something
looming underneath the traffic noise...

It's like a distant YELLING, but too distant to make out.
Slowly it becomes clearer, more distinct. It’s a WOMAN’S
VOICE and it’s yelling “Peter.”

Peter looks up. Where is it coming from?

WOMAN'S VOICE
(still vague)
...I expel you...!

Peter looks around. Soon his eyes settle on something...

Across the road, on a far sidewalk, JOAN is standing. She
looks raving mad. She’s staring directly at Peter and she’s
screaming like a lunatic.

JOAN
SATONY, DEGONY, EPARIGON!

Terrified, Peter rises from his seat. He looks around to see
if anyone else is noticing this. Nobody is.

JOAN (CONT'D)
PETER!

Peter looks back at her. They MEET EYES.

JOAN (CONT'D)
GET OUT, PETER!

Peter breaks the gaze. He looks around, appealing to any/all
of the circulating kids. It’s clear that none of them see or
hear this. How is that possible?

JOAN (0.S.) (CONT'D)
PETER!!!

INT. ANNIE’S WORKSHOP - DAY 132
Annie runs in from the hallway.

She rushes to the BOXES marked “Mom’s Things.” She opens the
first box and finds a HAND-EMBROIDERED WELCOME MAT. It’s the
exact same style as Joan’s. Embroidered into it is the name
“ANNIE”. Under that is another mat, bearing the name
“CHARLES” and featuring the now-familiar sigil of PAIMON.

Annie goes to the next box. She dig through a collection of
herbs and oils, and beneath those, she finds a familiar
hardback: NOTES ON SPIRITUALISM. Below this, a couple other
hardbacks: one that appears to be a GRIMOIRE (book of spells)
and the other titled INVOCATIONS.
Green Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 99.

INVOCATIONS’ cover features an esoteric sigil. Annie opens
the book to find that it’s filled with vivid etchings of
DEMONIC POSSESSION RITUALS.

Annie goes to a MARKED PAGE. It features an illustration ofa
beastly man with a hulking body and a strangely effeminate
face. He rides a dromedary and wears a crown. Tied to his hip
is a collection of SEVERED HEADS. Behind him is a queue of
frolicking ghouls, all headless and all playing instruments.
A title reads “King Paimon (God of Mischief)."

Annie finds a HIGHLIGHTED PARAGRAPH: "When successfully
invoked, Paimon will possess the most vulnerable host. Only
when the ritual is complete will Paimon be locked into his
ordained host. Once locked in, a new ritual is required to
unlock the possession."

A sentence underlined in pencil reads: "Paimon is Male, thus
covetous of a male human body."

The next page features an etching of a man sitting atopa
mountain of treasure. A caption reads: “The riches to the
conjurer."

Annie comes to the TITLE PAGE of the book. There isa
handwritten NOTE. It reads:

My darling, dear, beautiful Annie,

Forgive me all the things I could not tell you, as TI
truly could not. Please don’t hate me and try not to
despair your losses. You will see in the end that they
were worth it.

Our sacrifice will pale next to the rewards.
Love, Mommy

Mortified, Annie throws the book into the box, and digs
deeper to find TWO PHOTO ALBUMS, familiarly titled
“Memories.”

Annie flips through one of the albums. For a while, nothing
of note. But then she FINDS something...

A PHOTO of ANNIE’S MOTHER, 20 years younger, standing with
JOAN, also 20 years younger. They both wear replicas of
Annie's NECKLACE - the one bearing the now-familiar sigil of
Paimon.

Stunned, Annie continues through the photo album. She finds
SEVERAL MORE PHOTOS FEATURING JOAN, who's often standing in
the background. Always wearing the necklace. She and Annie's
Mother were evidently close friends.

Another photo: Annie’s mother guides a baby bottle into BABY
CHARLIE’s mouth. The bottle’s milk is polluted with black
herbs.
133

134

135

100.

Finally, Annie comes to a particularly bizarre photo. It
features Joan pouring gold/silver coins over Annie’s Mother's
head. Annie’s Mother, wearing a tiara, is weeping/laughing
tears of joy. They are surrounded by an intimate, APPLAUDING
audience.

INT. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY 133
Students are returning to class.

Peter walks trembling down the hall. Any lingering kids
disperse to enter their classrooms. Peter approaches his

classroom, a gnawing apprehension taking him over.

Suddenly, from behind Peter, a FLASH of light STREAKS across
the length of the hall. It sweeps past Peter. He FREEZES.

The light seems to disappear at Peter’s CLASSROOM. Peter
stares at the door.

Through the door’s window, MR. DAVIES (the teacher) turns to
see Peter. They lock eyes. Davies smiles expectantly.

Feeling pressured, Peter walks to the classroom. He ENTERS.
INT. GRAHAM HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER 134
The hallway is crawling with flies.

Annie, still holding the photo album, enters (from the
Workshop) to investigate.

The ceiling’s ATTIC HATCH is now covered in more flies than
ever. It’s clearly the source of the infestation.

Annie, eyes crazed with paranoia, stares at the hatch. A
short (but accessible) rope hangs from it, asking to be
pulled.

Annie pulls on the rope, slowly OPENING the attic hatch and
releasing its retractable stairway. A HORDE OF FLIES escapes
the attic.

Annie hesitates before climbing up.

INT. ATTIC - CONTINUOUS 135
The attic is dank and claustrophobic. There is one window,
letting in scant moonlight. Otherwise, the space is obscured
in utter darkness.

Annie pokes her head in. At the foot of the entrance is a
FLASHLIGHT. Annie takes it, turns it on, and shines its beam
into the shadows.

Flies are everywhere. Their buzzing permeates the room.
136

101.

Waving away the flies, Annie explores the space. It’s filled
with discarded pieces of the family’s past. Old cribs, a
mattress, toys, etc.

Finally, Annie’s FLASHLIGHT dawns on something. A FIGURE
lying prostrate in the corner. Annie approaches it. The flies
get louder. Annie finally gets close enough to SEE...

It is a WOMAN’S CORPSE, and upon closer inspection, its HEAD
is seen to be MISSING. From the white and wrinkled hands,
it’s evident that this was an old woman. She is also wearing
a WHITE SILK ROBE - identical to the one that Charlie saw the
corpse wearing earlier in the woods. (Is this Ellen Leigh’s
corpse?) A large TRIANGLE has been drawn in chalk around the
body.

Annie GASPS, staggers back, and bends over to RETCH. As she
does so, the flashlight’s beam crosses something on the
VAULTED CEILING above the body. Annie pauses before raising
the flashlight. She trains it on the ceiling to reveal...

THE SIGIL OF PAIMON has been painted onto the ceiling in now-
dry BLOOD. Flies crawl across its coarse black-red strokes.

INT. CLASSROOM - DAY 136

Peter sits at the back of the class. He WRINGS his hands,
anxiety mounting. He’s still thinking about the woman (Joan)
who was yelling at him.

Mr. Davies stands at the chalkboard. Written on the board:
“Punishment brings wisdom.”

MR. DAVIES
So, everyone feels justified:
Iphigenia’s murder was commanded by
the gods - so really Agamemnon had
no choice. And Clytemnestra is
driven by revenge, just like
Orestes when he returns...

Suddenly, Peter hears something behind him. A distant
CLICKING of the tongue. We focus in on Peter’s EAR. Separated
by a few seconds each, the clicks become clearer and more
present with every CLICK. It’s as if the source is nearing.
Soon it’s loud enough to be RIGHT NEXT TO PETER’S FACE.

Suddenly, as seen from behind, PETER’S ARM SPIKES UP INTO THE
AIR. Because we’re behind him, we don’t see Peter’s face. The
tense arm is HELD there, as if being pulled by an unseen
force. The clicking sound continues.

Mr. Davies turns to notice Peter.
MR. DAVIES (CONT'D)

(calling on him)
Peter.
102.

Mr. Davies waits, but after a moment, his expression darkens
into concern.

MR. DAVIES (CONT'D)
Peter, are you okay?

We now reveal PETER. His face is CONTORTED with terrible
stress, as if his head were gripped by an electric vice. His
eyes are locked open; his eyeballs darting around, as if
appealing for help. His hand remains stiffly raised and he
seems to have difficulty breathing. In fact, his face is
about to turn purple.

PETER CLICKS HIS TONGUE. He’s now the one clicking.

MR. DAVIES (CONT'D)
Peter. What’s wrong?

Bridget, staring at Peter, looks especially disturbed. Peter
CLICKS again.

MR. DAVIES (CONT'D)
I...

Suddenly Peter GASPS a horrible, gurgling gasp. It sounds
like an agonized SQUEAL, much like the one we heard from
Charlie during her allergic attack (before her decapitation).

BRIDGET
(terrified)
Can he breathe?!

A spit-bubble forms on Peter’s lips as he struggles
hopelessly to speak. But then--

Peter’s head is SLAMMED FACE-DOWN into his desk. It holds
there, trembling with tension. His face is SMEARED across the
desktop, as if a great pressure is being applied to the back
of his head. One can almost hear Peter’s nose CRUNCHING.

Peter’s head suddenly swings back up, as if being YANKED by
the hair. He is held upright for a moment, revealing that his
eyes are pitch-red with tears. His nose is also bleeding
lightly. He looks extremely disoriented.

PETER
MOM!

Peter’s head is SLAMMED back down, into the table. Blood
BURSTS out of his now-broken nose.

The class screams!

Peter, suddenly in possession of his faculties, KICKS himself
back. He stumbles out of his chair, knocking over the desk as
he staggers backward. He has been RELEASED from whatever was
just gripping him.
137

138

139

140

Green Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 103.
He SCREAMS, throwing his arms around, fending off whatever it
was. He breaks down in SOBS, fraught with terror.
The class is completely silent.
INT. STEVE’S OFFICE - DAY 137
A haggard Steve sits in his office, nursing a scotch.
His cell phone VIBRATES. It’s ANNIE.
Steve just stares at it. Letting it vibrate. It stops.

After a moment, the office phone RINGS. He looks at it.
Thinks about answering. Doesn't.

He turns in his chair, raising the scotch to his lips.
Ignoring the phone. He downs the glass.

We now reveal the office phone’s CALLER ID. This call is
coming from Peter’s High School.

INT. GRAHAM HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY 138

The land-line rings. It’s the high school, now calling the
Graham house.

Nobody is home.
INT. CAR - SAME TIME 139
Annie sits in her car, parked on the street. She is waiting
in the driver seat, eyes crazed. She watches the house,
holding her cell phone at the ready.
A car drives by. She turns to investigate. It’s not Steve.
ANNIE
(to herself)
Goddamn it, Steve. Come home.
INT. STEVE’S OFFICE - SAME TIME 140

Steve is still in his office, eyes closed, leaning back in
his chair. Clinging to the peace.

The phone rings again. He sets his drink on the table and
grudgingly answers.

STEVE
Hello?

Pause. Steve suddenly becomes alert.

STEVE (CONT'D)
What? What happened?
(listens for a moment)
(MORE )
141

142

Green Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 104.

STEVE (CONT'D)
Okay. Yes. I’m coming now. Which
hospital?

INT. CAR (MOVING) - LATE AFTERNOON 141

Steve is now driving home. PETER is asleep in the back seat.
His nose is HEAVILY BANDAGED and his eyes are black and blue.

Steve looks at the rear-view mirror while he drives. Watches
his son sleep.

Steve looks back to the road to see -- he’s about to runa
red light. He STOMPS on the brake.

Despite the harsh stop, Peter remains asleep.

Steve grips the wheel, on the edge of his seat. A moment of
tense silence and then: the floodgates open. Steve starts
CRYING, overwhelmed. After a moment of this, he regains
composure.

The light goes GREEN.
INT. ANNIE’S CAR - LATE AFTERNOON 142
Annie is still waiting anxiously in her car.

Steve’s car is seen pulling into the Graham driveway. Annie
heaves a relieved sigh - “finally!” But then she notices that
Steve is pulling an unconscious Peter out of the back seat.
She sees Peter’s bandaged nose and PANICS.

Annie jumps out of the car and bounds over. She’s gripping
her mother’s photo album.

ANNIE
Oh my God what happened?!

Steve turns to Annie as she arrives. He’s in no mood for any
histrionics. Annie GASPS at the sight of Peter’s face.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
Who did that?!

STEVE
He did apparently. Smashed his own
face into his desk, hard enough to
break it.

This only feeds Annie’s paranoia. She covers her mouth with
her hands.

ANNIE
(needing to tell him)
Steve...
143

105.

STEVE
(blunt)
Please: just take his feet.

Annie hesitantly gathers Peter’s feet. Steve proceeds toward
the house, carrying Peter by his underarms.

INT. PETER’S BEDROOM - DAY 143

Outside, Max's BARKING is heard. It will persist through the
following scene.

Steve and Annie lay the comatose Peter into bed. Steve looks
down at Peter, sapped. He’s avoiding Annie’s eyes.

ANNIE
Steve.

Steve waits for her to continue.
ANNIE (CONT'D)
...Upstairs, in the attic... When
you were gone, I went up there.
Steve closes his eyes, not wanting to hear whatever’s coming.
ANNIE (CONT'D)
There’s a decapitated body. An old
woman...
Steve’s eyes open, numb. He looks blankly at Annie.
ANNIE (CONT'D)

(reacting)
That’s what all the flies are!

STEVE
(zero inflection)
A body?
ANNIE STEVE (CONT'D)
Go upstairs. Look for
yourself. Whose body?

ANNIE
I think it might be my mother’s. I
think! I can’t tell! The skin is
black and she’s all distended, but
it’s an old woman and the head is
gone... Go see for yourself.

Steve STARES at her before walking into the hall and
approaching the attic hatch.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
And then there’s more.
144

145

106.

STEVE
More than your mother’s headless
body. Of course.

Steve reaches for the attic hatch. He pulls it down and a
mass of FLIES escapes.

Steve pauses, now much more nervous about what he’s about to
find. He begins to climb the stairs.

Annie now RUNS downstairs...

INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 144
Annie rushes to the fireplace. She starts a FIRE.

Max's barking continues off-screen.

INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER 145
The hatch is still open. We hear from within the attic:

STEVE (0.S.)
Jesus fuck!

Annie has run back upstairs.

Sounds of distress (from above) as Steve rushes to the stairs

and stumbles down into the hallway. He’s pale with shock.
STEVE (CONT'D) ANNI

What the fuck! There’s more.

STEVE
Why haven't you called the police?!

ANNIE
The police can’t help us!

This makes Steve pause. Did Annie do this?

STEVE
Who is that, Annie?

Annie squeezes her mother’s photo album.

ANNIE
Do you remember Joan, my friend?
Her grandson died and she took me
to her apartment?

Steve’s eyes are harrowed.
STEVE

(to himself)
It did look like your mother.
Green Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 107.

ANNIE
Listen! She taught me how to do the
seance. I didn’t even want to know.
But she brought her grandson back,
and I saw it and I felt it - just
like you did with Charlie.

Steve eyes Annie with growing revulsion. She now opens the
photo album. She’s frighteningly energetic.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
This was my mother’s album. Okay?
Now look: this woman, right here,
that’s her! That’s Joan!

Annie is pointing at a photo of Joan (20 years younger)
standing with Annie’s mother (20 years younger). Annie speaks
quickly to prevent Steve from interrupting.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
She never mentioned knowing my mother
and I never met her before, but she
approached me, she consoled me, and
she told me about the seance, she
showed me how, and now - look:

 

Steve can’t listen to this, but Annie desperately draws his
attention to the photo of Annie’s Mother being showered in
coins by Joan. Annie points at the NECKLACE.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
That’s the necklace my mom gave me.
Right? It’s my mother’s necklace.
Right?

Now Annie points out another photo: her mother posing with
Joan - both wearing the same necklace.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
They're both wearing it. And
they're wearing it in every photo!

Steve, now completely pale, doesn’t react. He’s staring at
Annie like she’s a contagious disease.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
And look at the pattern! Did you
see up there? This was painted
above the body. Right?! In blood?!

STEVE
(dawning on him)
..-You dug up the grave.

ANNIE
What?!
Green Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 108.

STEVE ANNIE (CONT'D)
It was you, wasn’t it? When
you were going out, “to the
movies"? You're not even listening!

STEVE
(horrified)
And when the cemetery called...
(outraged at the
thought)
I didn’t tell you because I didn’t
want to worry you.

ANNIE
Goddamn it! LISTEN to me, Steve! I
know you don’t trust me - there’s
nothing I can do_about that - but
they put a curse on us, and when we
brought back Charlie -

STEVE
We didn't bring back Charlie!

ANNIE
(continuing)
- we made a PACT with something! I
don’t know what it is, but it’s in
the house and it wants Peter!

Annie pulls out Charlie’s DRAWING PAD. She opens it and flips
through the sketches of Peter with his eyes X’d out.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
I watched these pages fill. They’re
all of Peter.

She looks up at Steve.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
I’m sorry, Steve: I don’t know what
I did, but Peter’s in danger and
I’m the one who started this.

Annie takes Steve’s arm. He recoils at his wife’s touch. She
leads him toward the STAIRS.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
If we destroy this book, it’1l take
me too. I tried to burn it - I
tried - but my arm caught fire. On
its own. As if I was linked to it,
because I am linked! I know that
now. But if we don’t destroy
this...Peter will...

She's too overwhelmed to finish her thought. Steve’s eyes
register no compassion. He skeptically follows her down the
stairs toward the LIVING ROOM.
109.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
It needs to be me, Steve. It’s my
fault! I need you to throw it in
the fire.

Steve just stares at her.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
I can’t do it! I can’t throw it in!
I’m too scared. But if you don’t,
it’ll be Peter. I know it will.
(breaks down crying at
the thought)
It‘’ll be our son!

Annie puts the drawing pad in Steve’s hand. She closes his
fingers around it. She tries to calm herself down.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
Please baby. I can’t do it. I need
you to throw it in the fire.

Annie takes a canister of LIGHTER FLUID and proceeds to DOUSE
the drawing pad. She then looks at Steve with great love and
sadness.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
Even if you can’t believe me:
You're the love of my life.

Annie KISSES him passionately. It has the desperation of a
farewell kiss. Steve’s lips are stone.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
I love you, Steve. I love you so
much. And I love Peter so much!

Annie is crying hysterically. Max’s barking continues.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
Please! Throw it in!

Steve walks in a horrified daze toward the FIREPLACE. But
then -- he STOPS SHORT. He turns to Annie.

STEVE
I’m not doing this anymore with
you, Annie.

ANNIE
(panicked)

What? No.
STEVE

This isn’t helping you. You're very
sick and I need to call the police.
146

147

Green Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 110.

That does it. Annie storms toward Steve, SEIZES the drawing
pad, runs to the fireplace, and HURLS the book into the fire.
It is immediately CONSUMED by the flames, and then, like
clockwork--

STEVE IGNITES INTO A RAGING BALL OF FLAMES. He cries out as
he is instantaneously swallowed up by the screaming fire.

Annie can’t even scream. She’s frozen in horror. Her eyes are
LOCKED on the sight of her husband’s burning. And what's
more, the ominous STREAK OF LIGHT has returned - now bouncing
wildly around the room. Max’s off-screen BARKING has reached
an insane pitch.

We see Steve’s searing reflection in Annie’s fixed pupil. The
fire is impossibly violent. Now, at the scene’s shrieking
apex, the streak of light settles on Annie - entering her!
SLAM TO BLACK

Silence.

A distant drumming fades in...

EXT. WOODS - NIGHT 146
The WOODED AREA behind the Graham house. It’s snowing.

A drum circle seems to be in progress somewhere unseen.
Repetitive, minimal PERCUSSION (like subdued war drums)
thumps faintly and steadily in the distance.

INT. PETER’S BEDROOM - SAME TIME 147
Silence. Max’s barking has STOPPED.

Peter’s eyes blink OPEN from his deep sleep. He bolts up with
a start. He’s in his room, under the covers.

He squints with pain. He reaches to touch his nose, but
discovers the heavy plaster bandage.

Outside Peter’s window: the TREEHOUSE. A dim, golden light -
like candlelight - flickers from within.

Peter stares at it. The drums are barely heard in the b.g.
They will continue.

The drums are momentarily drowned out by the sound of a CAR
DRIVING BY outside. Its HEADLIGHTS gently illuminate Peter's
room, scanning the walls (in pale blue) as the car drifts by.

For the briefest moment, in this fleeting light, we see...

ANNIE, still wearing her nightgown, in the top corner of the
room. She seems to be FLOATING WEIGHTLESSLY. She’s so
elevated, in fact, that her head is turned to the side and
her cheek pressed against the ceiling.
148

111.

There’s something still and composed about her; something
resolutely NOT Annie. Her eyes are WIDE and her face
expressionless. She’s behind Peter, STARING at his back. He
doesn’t notice.

The car has now passed, and the room is obscured again in
darkness. Annie is no longer clearly visible.

Peter senses something behind him. He pauses, listens. Then
he begins to TURN.

Annie, back pressed against the wall, scrambles (in a silent
panic) across the wall and OUT the door. She seems to be CRAB-
WALKING across the wall’s surface.

Peter looks back just as Annie has left. He didn’t see her.
Peter climbs out of bed. He goes to leave the bedroom.

INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 148
As Peter enters the hallway, a SHARP CLANGING SOUND is heard
downstairs. Peter freezes. A sustained REVERB fills the

house. It sounded like it came from a piano.

Peter remains motionless, listening.

PETER
Dad?

Flies are everywhere.

Peter walks over to his parents’ BEDROOM.
He peers in. It’s empty.

He turns back to the hall.

PETER (CONT'D)
Mom? Dad?

Peter looks up at the ATTIC HATCH, now closed. The SOUND OF
FLIES is especially aggressive up there.

He then notices that ANNIE’S MOM’S BEDROOM DOOR IS OPEN. He
looks inside. EMPTY. He closes the door.

Peter continues warily down the hall. He approaches the
stairs.

PETER (CONT'D)
Hello?

Peter leans to peer down the stairs. He sees nothing. He
slowly proceeds downward.
149

150

112.

INT. FOYER - CONTINUOUS 149

Peter arrives at the bottom of the stairs. The foyer is
empty.

Peter notices the PIANO. It seems to have been tampered with.
The lid is open and a couple of the wires have been SNAPPED.

Peter carefully walks through the foyer, eyes scanning
around. Paranoia building.

He approaches the LIVING ROOM, which is faintly illuminated
by an off-screen flame.

INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 150

Peter stops at the doorway. His eyes travel across the walls
to finally come to...

The FIREPLACE. The last of a dim fire (mostly embers)
crackles in the pit. And lying before the fireplace is...

A CHARRED, BLACK CORPSE. It lies twisted on the rug.

Peter stands frozen, trying to discern what it is. He takes a
reluctant step forward and slowly approaches the dark figure.
Peter finally comes close enough to SEE...

The body’s HEAD has been violently AMPUTATED. The PINK/RED of
the exposed neck contrasts garishly with the crisped whole.
The body is on its back, arched and contorted.

Peter looks at the HANDS. The fingers are curled into
desperate claws. One finger bears STEVE’S WEDDING RING.

Peter opens his mouth to scream, but all that comes out isa
muted gust of air. Tears well in his eyes. He can’t even
summon the strength to look away. And above him...

ANNIE is huddled up into a corner of the ceiling. Her face is
twisted with grief and fear, and she is shaking her head -
“no, no, no, no, no” — as if pleading with the back of
Peter’s head, like a frightened animal. She holds PIANO WIRE,
pulling it taut with both hands. Wringing blood.

Peter FREEZES, sensing something behind him. He slowly turns,
but not toward Annie...

Peter looks to the other corner of the room. The CLOSET DOOR
is cracked open. Peter SQUINTS at it. Standing in the dark
closet, barely visible, is a MAN IN A RED CLOAK - staring at
him.

Peter is paralyzed.
He then SENSES something in the corner of the ceiling - where

Annie was. His eyes scan tensely to the corner, but Annie is
now GONE.
151

152

153

113.

Pregnant silence.

Suddenly, from behind Peter, Annie BURSTS SCREAMING out of
the darkness, dashing towards him.

Peter RUNS squealing out of the room. He sprints for the
STAIRS.

Peter bounds up the staircase, but at the top step, he trips
over his own foot. He crashes to his knees, scrambling to get
back up. Behind him, we hear Annie pursuing.

Peter races madly through the HALLWAY. The attic hatch is now
inexplicably OPEN. He dashes for the ATTIC STAIRS.

He runs up the stairs and immediately RETRACTS them - just as
Annie reaches him. Peter manages to pull the attic hatch
SHUT, almost catching Annie’s bloody fingers.

INT. ATTIC - CONTINUOUS 151

Peter LOCKS the floor’s hatch. There is a mad POUNDING from
beneath.

INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 152

Annie is UPSIDE DOWN and straddling the ceiling (as though
gravity were no longer a thing). She pulls at the attic knob,
SLAMMING her head into the hatch.

She bangs her head crazily against the ceiling, over and
over. With every strike, she POUNDS her forehead harder and
more wildly against the hatch - like a mad bull, trying to
break through by sheer force.

INT. ATTIC - CONTINUOUS 153

Peter stands in the dark, screaming and crying as the
pounding persists. It keeps growing harder, faster, more
insane - until it STOPS.

Peter listens... Nothing. Just the shrill cacophony of
buzzing flies. Beside him, at his feet, is a dwindling BLACK
CANDLE.

PETER
(terrified)
Mommy ?

Peter looks up. BLACK CANDLES HAVE BEEN SET UP ALL AROUND THE
ATTIC. Their flames dimly illuminate the clutter.

Peter now looks to the CORNER that earlier enshrined the
headless corpse. The corpse is now gone, but something tiny
has replaced it. The distance and weak light preclude Peter
from identifying it.
114.

Peter begins to approach the corner, tears streaming. He sees
the bloody sigil on the vaulted ceiling above. As he walks,
the buzzing gets LOUDER, more concentrated.

Peter continues warily toward the corner, his fear rising.
The buzzing has gotten even louder. Finally Peter gets close
enough to SEE...

In the center of the chalk-etched triangle is a PHOTOGRAPH OF
PETER WITH HIS EYES X’d OUT.

Stunned and confused, Peter REELS back, knocking over a
candle. The corner goes dark. Peter is weeping uncontrollably
now. He starts backing away, toward the room’s center. His
eyes remain glued to his photograph.

PETER (CONT’D)
(to himself, crying)
Please. This isn’t happening. You

need to wake up.

Peter’s teeth are chattering. He’s hyperventilating. His
trembling silhouette is framed by the WINDOW behind him.
Outside the window: dreamy snowfall.

Peter continues backing up, but something makes him FREEZE. A
prolonged GROAN, accompanied by the sound of WIRE being
wrapped and tightened around FLESH. It’s coming from a source
about twenty feet away, BEHIND him. This is followed by a
swifter, HARSHER SOUND - like a saw being dragged through
flesh. A pregnant PAUSE and then the sound REPEATS. A briefer
pause and it REPEATS again.

Peter slowly turns around. His eyes travel up to SEE...

ANNIE has somehow gotten in. She floats weightlessly in the
air. (She is faintly illuminated by a candle below her.) She
has looped the PIANO WIRE around her own NECK, which is
already straining blood. She TUGS on one end of the wire. It
SAWS through her neck. She TUGS on the other end of the wire.
It saws even deeper.

PETER (CONT'D)
Mommy !

Annie keeps sawing, FASTER and HARDER and with more ruthless
persistence. The sawing sound is horrible. Peter, screaming,
TURNS away, only to see:

A MIDDLE-AGED BLONDE MAN, dressed in a red cloak, near Peter.
He’s SMILING giddily. (We will recognize him as the man who
was smiling at Charlie at Annie’s mother’s funeral.) Behind
him, two SMILING OLDER WOMEN. They are crouched together,
illuminated by a nearby candle-flame.

PETER SCREAMS, TURNS, AND RUNS STRAIGHT FOR THE WINDOW. HE
JUMPS THROUGH THE GLASS.
154

155

115.

EXT. GRAHAM HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 154

Peter has landed face-first into the SNOW. Small shards of
glass are embedded all over his body, but nothing too
serious.

Peter lies motionless for a long time.

We cut WIDE to a BIRD’S EYE VIEW looking down on Peter. He
lies face-down in the blue-white snow, inanimate. The wind
blows softly.

We HOLD on this peaceful, static wide. After a moment, a
SHADOW floats gracefully across the snow. It belongs to
Annie, who must be above us - but the shadow seems headless.

The shadow drifts out of frame, followed by the vague,
familiar STREAK OF LIGHT. The light, however, STOPS at Peter.
It dances on his back... steadies... disappears into him.

After a moment, Peter’s head RISES languidly from the snow.

His face is marked by a few minor GASHES (from the glass). He
looks up, EYES STRANGELY CALM. They even look a bit clouded.
He looks ahead to the TREEHOUSE...

PETER’S POV: Annie’s floating body has arrived at the
treehouse, which is still glowing by candlelight. She ascends
into it. For a split-second, before she disappears into the
treehouse, we see that ANNIE HAS NO HEAD.

Peter rises to his feet, hollow-eyed. His gaze trained on the
treehouse. He seems to be in some sort of TRANCE - much like
the trance that Charlie entered earlier. After a moment of

standing, staring at the treehouse...Peter CLICKS HIS TONGUE.

With that, he begins walking slowly toward the treehouse.

He passes MAX'S DEAD CARCASS, sprawled across a snow-buried
garden.

As Peter nears the treehouse, he looks up to its OPEN
WINDOW...

Through the window, from Peter’s low-angle POV: a birdcage
hangs from the treehouse ceiling. It houses a manic
WHIPPOORWILL.

We cut to a WIDE of the treehouse as Peter arrives at the
tree’s base.

Peter pauses. Looks up. After a beat, he begins to leadenly
climb up.

INT. TREEHOUSE - CONTINUOUS 155

Peter, having scaled the tree, pokes his head through the
floor-hatch and climbs in.
116.

The walls are lined with black candles, and before Peter are
several MEN AND WOMAN (some elderly, some middle-aged) BOWING
on their knees, foreheads against the floor. They are all
dressed in RED CLOAKS.

Standing behind Peter (on the opposite side of the treehouse)
is the terrible object of their reverence. He turns to see...

A GIANT, 6’ WOOD-FIGURE MANIKIN. Placed atop its shoulders
(in lieu of a head) is CHARLIE’S DECAPITATED HEAD - now inan
advanced state of decomposition. The nose is still smashed
in, much of the face is black with rot, and it wears asilver
CROWN. One hand grips a wooden SCEPTER. The manikin’s other
hand is raised to extend its first two fingers and thumb; the
third and fourth fingers are bent (like a Christ figure).

Bowing at the foot of the manikin is ANNIE’S HEADLESS TORSO -
blood pooling at the neck. Beside her corpse, also
prostrated, is ANNIE’S MOTHER’S HEADLESS CORPSE (still
dressed in white silk, but in a worse state of decay).

Peter's eyes are WIDE, but still blank. They are FIXED on
Charlie’s head. He looks more confused than horrified.

Peter turns around to face the groveling red-cloaked
worshippers. They now seem to be bowing in his direction.

Among the worshippers is JOAN - her forehead pressed to the
floor.

Peter, unnerved, looks away. He notices...

A photo portrait of ANNIE’S MOTHER on the wall. She sits
upright and her expression is severe. The frame bears an
engraving: “Queen Leigh”

We come to a CLOSE-UP of Peter. He looks confused and scared
(although not in a way that feels like Peter). We will HOLD
on this CU for the remainder of the scene.

The sound of someone RISING. This person (Joan) shuffles past
Peter to lift the crown off of Charlie’s head. She then comes
to stand (now off-screen) before Peter. After a moment, the
CROWN enters frame to be placed ceremoniously onto Peter's
head.

Peter has TENSED up, desperately avoiding eye contact with
Joan. He SENSES something behind him. He looks back (and we
pan-tilt) to see...

The headless corpses of Peter’s family are now inexplicably
bowing in his direction.

Peter turns forward again - overwhelmed. He looks trapped.
Trembling. His milky eyes are welling with tears.
117.

JOAN (0.S.)
(quietly, trying to
soothe)

Hey hey - no no - you're all

right...

But he is starting to PANIC. His eyes fix fearfully to the
floor as his breathing grows erratic. Then:

JOAN (0.S.) (CONT'D)
Hey: hey: Charlie.

Peter's breathing HALTS. He looks up to Joan, still
trembling. Eyes wide.

JOAN (CONT'D)
You're all right now.

A long silence as Peter searches Joan's face for
understanding. Peter finally SPEAKS...but he sounds more like
CHARLIE than Peter.

PETER
Who am I?

A loaded pause from Joan. Then:

JOAN (0.S.)
You are Paimon. One of the eight
Kings of Hell.

Beat. Peter doesn’t react. He just stares at her,
uncomprehending.

JOAN (0.S.) (CONT'D)

We have looked to the northwest and
called you in. We’ve corrected your
first body and give you now this
healthy male host. We reject the
Trinity and pray devoutly to you,
great Paimon: give us your
knowledge of all secret things and
all mysteries of the Earth; bring
us honor, wealth and good
familiars; and bind all men to our
Will, as we have bound ourselves
for now and ever to Yours.

We hear Joan return to her bowing position:

JOAN (0.S.) (CONT'D)
Hail Paimon.

Peter’s eyes are buzzing.

Then, from behind Joan:

118.
WORSHIPPERS (0.S.)
Hail Paimon!
Then, louder:

JOAN/WORSHIPPERS (0.S.)
Hail Paimon!!

EXT. TREEHOUSE - CONTINUOUS 156
WIDE of the treehouse.

WORSHIPPERS (0.S.)
Hail!!

CUT HARD TO BLACK.

HOLD ON THE BLACK.

From this, we VERY SLOWLY FADE IN ON:

A NEUTRAL WIDE OF THE GRAHAM HOUSE. NIGHT. Surrounded by
dreamy snowfall. A strong artifice distinguishes the image.
As if the actual house has somehow been replaced by its
MINIATURE REPLICA. Even the drifting snowflakes look false.

Hold on this as the CREDITS roll.
