FADE IN
WE’RE IN A CHILD'S POV. WE’RE RUNNING. FAST, DOWN A HALLWAY.

We HEAR panting, our own heavy breaths. We’re scared,
terrified even. Something's very wrong.

The hallway feels endless. There’s no escape.

We TRIP, fall down. We’re dazed for a moment. We HEAR
something else now, something behind us...a RUMBLING.

We LOOK back...

EVERYTHING IS ON FIRE! THE SOUND IS DEAFENING.

 

The flames are alive, licking the walls, barrelling towards
us like they want to swallow us up...

 

INT. PLASTIC TENT/MOTEL ROOM - DAY

ELI (11) BOLTS AWAKE from his nightmare. His face is pale,
big bags under his eyes. He’s choking on air, wheezing
uncontrollably. He can’t get a breath.

He looks around frantically. He’s inside his plastic tent,
used to quarantine him from his surroundings. The walls are
opaque and the room outside looks foggy.

There’s a A LOUD HUMMING SOUND, an air purifier pumping clean
air into the tent from a hose.

Eli himself is wearing A SANITARY FACE MASK. His bed has been
stripped of the motel supplied sheets and comforter and
replaced with a special hypo-allergenic kind.

A DARK SHAPE approaches the tent wall. But an angelic voice
whispers into the tent...

MOM (0.S.)
(soothing)
Breath honey, it’s okay. You’re
okay.
ELI
(wheezing)

Dust...there’s dust!

MOM (0.S.)
It was just a bad dream. There’s no
dust. I made sure everything was
totally clean.

MOM (0.S.) (CONT'D)
Remember what we practiced, in one-
two, out one-two, in one-two, out
one-two.

Eli does as Mom directs. It’s a tried and true practice. He
takes a breath, holds, and releases.

As Eli does his breathing, Mom sings softly to him:

MOM (CONT'D)
(singing)

You are my sunshine, my only

sunshine. You make me happy, when

skies are grey...

The simple breathing technique works. He calms down.

WE REVEAL THE MOTEL ROOM from OUTSIDE THE TENT for the first
time. It’s a dingy roadside motel room, the kind where the
most modern appliance is a ten year old TV.

Mom stands just outside the tent, places her hand up against
the plastic wall. She’s in her mid 40s, midwestern Mom
attractive - but tired, frayed. She has a name, but if Eli
doesn’t use it then neither do we.

The plastic tent is less than an eighth on an inch thick, but
the separation between Eli and Mom feels huge.

A LIGHT CLICKS ON. It’s Dad, laying in the twin bed next to
the tent. He’s also mid 40s, in shape, goatee.

He removes a sleep mask to reveal eyes puffy with sleep, puts
on his glasses next to the nightstand. The clock says 6:00am.

DAD
Fire or dog?

Eli responds from inside the tent.
ELI
Fire.
(then)
I’m fine.

DAD
Of course you are, champ.

But the look on Eli’s face says he’s pretty far from okay.
A MONTAGE OF ELI’S MORNING ROUTINE

CUT TO: ELI WASHES UP

Eli wipes his body clean with ANTIBACTERIAL WIPES.

CUT TO: ELI BRUSHES HIS TEETH

He POURS BOTTLED WATER onto the toothbrush and begins to
brush his teeth. He spits the dirty water into a plastic cup
and sets it down.

CUT TO: ELI CHANGES CLOTHES

He pulls out a FRESH T-SHIRT from out of A VACUUM SEALED BAG.
Tosses it on.

CUT TO: ELI GETS INTO HIS GERM-FREE SUIT

It’s basically a full body HAZMAT SUIT, colored BRIGHT
YELLOW. Eli steps into the suit - far from thrilling. The
zipper’s on the inside and Eli ZIPS HIMSELF UP.

END MONTAGE

Now that Eli’s finished, he’s ready to leave the tent. The

fingers on his suit are too bulky work the zipper though, so
he gently slaps the tent wall to signal to Mom.

MOM
All zipped up?
ELI
(muffled)
Yes.
MOM

Sorry, honey, you have to speak up
in that thing.

ELI
Yes!

MOM
Okay, here I go.

Mom slowly unzips the tent and Eli steps outside. It’s not
easy to maneuver in the suit, he trips on the way out.

Mom catches him before he falls.

MOM (CONT'D)
Careful honey.

EXT. MOTEL - DAY

It’s a local motel in a small town. There’s TWO DELINQUENT
LOOKING TEENAGERS skateboarding in the parking lot.

Dad pulls the car around, a late model luxury SUV, a car you
only buy if you can afford the seventy-five dollars a week it
costs to fill the gas tank. There’s suitcases tied to the
roof. He honks the horn.

The motel room door opens and Mom steps out, a few suitcases
in her hand. She shoots a nervous glance at the DELINQUENT
TEENAGERS, keeps moving.

Dad gets out and starts loading the luggage.

Eli hasn't left the motel room yet. Mom turns back.

MOM
Come on, Eli. Let’s go.

Dad shuts the trunk.

Slowly, Eli peeks his head out from the motel room into the
harsh daylight. We see his sickly face through the plastic
visor of the suit.

He looks at the outside world like frightened prey. To Eli,
this beautiful summer day is terrifying.

Dad comes around to the back passenger side door.

DAD
Ready?

Eli looks nervous, but he gives his Dad a thumbs up.

DAD (CONT'D)
Okay. 3...2...1...Go!

On “Go” Eli races as fast as he can from the motel room to
the car. Dad opens the door just as Eli jumps in. Another
tried and true technique of Eli and his family.

INT. CAR - DAY - CONTINUOUS

Eli leaps into the backseat and Dad shuts the door quickly.
He’s panting, nervous, but he calms down once in the car.

He chooses the middle seat to sit, as far as he can from the
windows. He’s wheezing again. Mom turns from the front seat.

MOM
In one-two, out one-two...

Eli does his breathing exercises, calms down again.

From outside the car, Eli hears laughter. He turns to look
out his window. The Teenagers are laughing at him.

He catches their eye.
TEENAGER 1
(clearly stoned)
To infinity and beyond, dude.
They CRACK THEMSELVES UP.

Eli looks away, embarrassed. He balls his hand into a fist.

As they drive away, TEENAGER 1 tries to do a KICKFLIP and
FALLS on his face. TEENAGER 2 laughs hysterically.

Eli smiles a little himself.

EXT. WINDY COLORADO HIGHWAY - DAY

Their car drives through a windy, beautiful stretch of
highway in isolated Colorado. It’s SUMMER and the PINE TREES
lining the road are in full bloom.

Not another car in sight.

INT. CAR - DAY

SCRATCH-SCRATCH-SCRATCH. The SOUND of colored pencils on
paper.

It’s coming from Eli. He’s in the backseat of the car,
diligently working on a drawing with colored pencils.

INSERT ON DRAWING: an image of himself on a skateboard, still
dressed in his hazmat suit, ollieing high above the heads of
the two stunned-looking delinquent teenagers.

Meanwhile...in the front seat, Dad jams away to music, loud.

 

MOM
Honey, you mind turning it down?

Eli pays no attention to either of them.

8FLiX.com SCREENPLAY DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
DAD
Come on baby, you gotta listen to
this loud.

SCRATCH-SCRATCH-SCRATCH. Eli colors-in his hazmat suit. As he
works, his marks gets harder and harder.

Mom notices, looks at him through the rearview mirror.

MOM
How you feeling honey?

Eli doesn’t respond. Dad keeps jamming away.

SCRATCH-SCRATCH-SCRATCH. His face begins to tighten up. His
jaw clenches.

SCRATCH-SCRATCH-SCRA---. The colored pencil tip snaps. Eli
throws the pencil on the seat next to him in frustration. It
lands amid a collection of other broken colored pencils.

Mom shuts the music off abruptly. Surprises Dad.

DAD
Hey...!

Mom gives Dad a stern look. She notices Eli in the back.

Mom turns to face Eli, and as nicely as possible:

MOM
You doing okay back there?
ELI
(dismissive)
Fine.
MOM

Excited to finally be done with all
this driving?

Eli apathetically shrugs his shoulders. He’s clearly not
interested in talking. He gets out a new colored pencil and
starts to shade in another part of his drawing.

Mom’s about to say something else when Eli cuts her off.

ELI
What happened to the music?

Mom gives up, she’s clearly not going to get more out of him.
Dad can’t help but smile.

8FLiX.com SCREENPLAY DATABASE

DAD
(teasing)
The boy’s got his Dad’s good taste.
He turns the music back up.

Mom breathes out a heavy anxious sigh. Dad undercuts his
teasing by reaching his hand over, gently massages her neck.

In the backseat, Eli continues to color.

EXT. WINDY ROAD - CONTINUOUS

The car speeds OUT OF FRAME.

EXT. ISOLATED ROCKY ROAD/INT. MOM’S CAR - DAY - LATER
Dad pulls off the main road onto a smaller, rocky road.

Eli’s moved on from drawing and is now reading a book on his
IPAD. As Eli flips the (electronic) pages, we realize what
he’s reading because of the illustrations. It’s PINNOCHIO.

They pass by A DILAPIDATED COTTAGE with an old red paint job
bleached years over from sunlight and harsh weather. There's
A LITTLE GIRL balancing herself on an old wooden fence.

She immediately catches Eli’s eye. He puts the iPad down.

The little girl is roughly Eli’s age and her hair is a fiery
red; her hand-me-down dress thoroughly worn.

MOM
Didn't realize we had neighbors.

She moves across the old fence, arms outstretched to balance
herself. Eli’s eyes are glued to her. But in a moment, the
car rounds a bend and the little girl disappears from view.

MOM (CONT'D)
Turn here.

The car pulls into a long driveway lined with trees on either
side, serene but isolated.

They turn around a slight bend and the trees open up,
revealing...

EXT. ELI’S NEW HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

A remarkable Gothic-style house, old-looking but somehow
modern. The outside’s been redone, the door is made of steel.

It’s big enough to house ten people, quite a bit more than
Eli and his parents.

INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS
Eli stares incredulously up at the house through the window.

ELI
This is where we’re living?

Remarkably, both Mom and Dad have the same look as Eli.

DAD
Yeah, this is where we're living?

MOM
Well, she said it was isolated.

EXT. PATH TO THE HOUSE - DAY

Eli walks up to the path to his new house with great
trepidation. It might as well be hot lava on all sides of
him. He stays wedged between Mom and Dad.

EXT. ELI’S NEW HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - DAY

Eli, Mom and Dad stand in front of the solid steel front
door. No locks or doorknobs, it looks like the kind of thing
you might find in an ultra modern home, or a spaceship.

DAD
Hmm. Should we knock or do you
think there’s a doorbell--

Dad is interrupted by a FEMALE VOICE, friendly but firm, from
a speaker near the door. There’s a small camera above it.

VOICE/DR. HORN (0.S.)
Hello, Miller family. I’m Dr. Horn.
Apologies for the formal
introduction, but in order to
maintain the sanctity of the house,
and protect Eli, I’m going to open
the door and have Eli enter. We can
have our personal introductions
afterwards.

9.

Eli takes a subtle step back, shields himself behind Mom and
Dad, scared. There’s nothing inherently frightening about Dr.
Horn’s voice, but the theatrics of it all are overwhelming.

DR. HORN (0.S.)
Don’t worry, Eli. There’s nothing
to be afraid of. Just a few
precautionary measures to keep this
clean house clean. Okay, I’m going
to open the door just enough for
you to enter, and I ask that you
enter as quickly as possible. We
want as little of the outside in as
possible. Ready?

Eli holds on tighter to Mom.
MOM
It’s okay, honey. Remember, this is
why we’re here.

The door begins to slide open.

DAD
3...2...1...Go!

Eli doesn’t move.

MOM
We'll be right behind you, honey.

Mom gently breaks Eli away. Eli steps inside.

INT. DECONTAMINATION CHAMBER — CONTINUOUS

Eli reaches the middle of the small room. The steel door
slams shut behind him, startling him.

The room is eerie and overwhelming. It appears to be some
sort of decontamination chamber. Ahead, another steel door.

Eli’s totally freaked, as would anyone.
Dr. Horn’s voice comes out of another speaker.

DR. HORN (0.S.)
Great job, Eli. Now this room is
going to kill all that bad, scary
air out there and give us good air
that you can breath. But it’s going
to be loud, and it’s going to be
bright, so don’t be scared, okay?
Are you ready? Here we go.

8FLiX.com SCREENPLAY DATABASE

10.

A LOUD HUM erupts inside the room, like a powerful vacuum.
Regardless of Dr. Horn’s preamble, it still startles Eli.

DR. HORN (0.S.) (CONT'D)
Now for the lights.

A blinding bright light goes on, and Eli’s vision whites-out.
It almost brings him to his knees.

But moments later the lights shut off and the humming ceases.
The steel door in front of him begins to slide open.

Eli’s vision is still blurry from the lights and he can’t
make out what’s on the other side.

The steel door finishes opening and Eli can make out a fuzzy
shape standing in the doorway.

DR. HORN (CONT'D)
Right this way, Eli.

The shape comes into focus. It’s DR. ISABELLA HORN (early
50s), in the flesh finally. We immediately get the sense that
she has bigger things on her mind than her appearance: she
wears neutral colored clothing and her hair is years uncut,
tied back in a ponytail. She flashes a warm, inviting smile.

DR. HORN (CONT’D)
I’m Dr. Horn. Welcome to your new
home.

INT. FOYER - DAY

The decontamination room door opens and Mom and Dad enter,
having just gone through the decontamination process.

Eli's grateful to have them there. He rushes to their side
quickly, grabs onto them.

DR. HORN
I told him he could take the suit
off, but he wanted to wait for you.
Mom bends down to Eli’s level. Looks him in the eye.

ELI
What if it isn’t safe?

8FLiX.com SCREENPLAY DATABASE

11.

MOM
It’s totally safe, Eli. That’s what
makes it so special here. No more
plastic barriers.

Eli looks around. High ceilings, lots of open space and
modern furniture. Everything new and clean.

DAD
You got this, champ.

With trepidation, Eli unzips his suit. He slowly removes the
helmet, takes a deep breath in. And then another. And
another. The air is clean.

He doesn’t hardly even get the suit off before Mom wraps her
arms around him and hugs him as tight as she can. Dad joins.

She starts kissing him all over his cheeks.

ELI
Okay, okay. That’s enough.

But Eli is laughing. He’s enjoying it too.

MOM
Oh it’s been so long since I could
hug my sweet little angel. I’1l
never let you go again.

DR. HORN
One of the many benefits of living
here.

Mom turns at Dr. Horn’s words and gives her a great big hug
of her own, surprising her a little.

MOM
Thank you, Dr. Horn.

She joyfully tears up.

DR. HORN
No thanks required.

Eli takes the rest of the suit off and relaxes a bit. Dad
turns his attention towards the interior of the house.

DAD
It’s actually not bad in here.

DR. HORN
You sound surprised.

Mom shoots Dad an annoyed look.

MOM
I think what he meant was...well,
we were expecting something more
like a hospital.

Dad walks over to a small window. Looks suspiciously at it.
Knocks on it. Plastic and sealed shut.

DR. HORN
On purpose. Although everything
here is specifically and specially
built for people like Eli, I don’t
like to think of it as a hospital,
or even a medical facility. To me,
this is a home.

Eli walks up to what once was a fireplace, but is now
cemented over. But Eli’s eyes are drawn to what’s hanging
over it, AN ELEGANT GOLD CRUCIFIX.

The PAINED FACE OF JESUS is particularly horrific, and the
look in his eyes gives Eli the willies.

DR. HORN (CONT’D)
But more importantly, it’s your
home. I want you to think of me as
your guest, not the other way
around.

INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY

Eli, Mom and Dad follow Dr. Horn down the hallway. It
connects to all the rooms and as Eli passes he looks into
them: THE LIVING ROOM, THE COMPUTER ROOM, ETC.

DAD
How long have you been doing this?

DR. HORN
I’ve been an immunologist for over
twenty five years, but I started
this home about ten years ago.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

A modern looking kitchen, large and spacious, with lots of
counter space and state of the art appliances.

DAD
Now this is my room!
(to Dr. Horn)
I’m the resident chef.

Mom leans in to Dr. Horn, jokes:

MOM
He used to flip burgers in high
school.

DAD

Yeah, you married me because of the
those burgers. Speaking of, maybe I
can make them tonight...

Dad opens the fridge and scopes it out: not thrilled.

DAD (CONT'D)
Or not.

DR. HORN
You've noticed, there’s no meat in
there. I have a diet I’m going to
request Eli to stick to. Dishes
high in immunity boosting grains
and vegetables like mushrooms and
barley. I'll give you a list.

ELI
No meat? I hate mushrooms.

DAD
I’m not the biggest fan of them
either, but if the doc says
mushrooms, you gotta eat mushrooms.

Dad rubs Eli’s hair. Mom kneels down to Eli’s level.

MOM
You know what, if you eat it, we
eat it. Because we’re all in this
together.

Dad gives her a look, “I don’t want to eat mushrooms.” Mom
quickly shoots it away with a look of her own.

INT. ELI’S ROOM - DAY

Dr. Horn opens the door to Eli’s room. Everyone steps inside.

8FLiX.com SCREENPLAY DATABASE

14.

DR. HORN
This is your room. It used to be
the dining room but I had it
converted.

The room is enormous. Patterned wallpaper, queen size bed,
large walk in closet, desk, bookshelves and tons of open
space to hang around in.

MOM
Wow, Eli. Looks like you made out
like a bandit.

Eli takes it in, but still doesn’t seem too enthusiastic. As
superficially nice as everything is, it’s a far cry from
anything resembling home.

Dr. Horn can see Eli’s unhappiness. She moves to the opposite
wall where there’s a large set of drapes.

DR. HORN
Our residents seem to like this.

She pulls the drapes open and Eli is immediately blasted by
sunlight from a giant floor to ceiling window, showcasing a
stunning view of the outside wilderness: trees, grass, even a
small stream about twenty yards out.

But instead of being pleased as Dr. Horn expected, Eli cowers
in fear, shields himself behind Mom and Dad.

MOM
Ever since he got sick, he doesn’t
do well with windows.

DR. HORN
Well Eli, I can assure you, you've
got nothing to worry about. The
windows here are made of thick
plastic, nothing can get in or out.
I find the natural lighting does
wonders for the psyche.

Eli still won’t get out from behind Mom and Dad.

ELI
Can you close the drapes, please.

DR. HORN
I promise you Eli, there’s
absolutely nothing--

ELI
Close them!

Eli’s sudden yell surprises Dr. Horn, but she’s obliges.

DR. HORN
Of course. I’m sorry.

MOM
Eli, don’t yell at Dr. Horn like
that. She’s trying to help.

DR. HORN
It’s quite alright. This is a huge
adjustment, it’s going to take some
getting used to.
(then)
I do think I have something that
might cheer you up though.

Dr. Horn smiles like she knows something AS WE CUT TO...

INT. ELI’S BATHROOM - DAY

CLOSE ON: A SHOWERHEAD - the kind pointing straight down from
the ceiling to simulate rain. Expensive.

DR. HORN (0.S.)
Probably a long time since you’ve
used one of these.

WE REVEAL Eli nervously looking at the shower.

Dr. Horn turns the water on and Eli reacts as if she just let
a_snarling dog off a leash. Fear in his eyes. Dr. Horn smiles
again, she’s seen this before.

DR. HORN (CONT’D)

I know it’s scary, but the water
here is totally safe, as is the
window, as is everything else. It’s
all completely filtered before it
ever reaches us.

Eli stares at the running water; it’s been a long time since
he’s felt flowing hot water on him.

DR. HORN (CONT’D)
Go ahead. Give it a feel.

Eli shakes his head. He won’t do it.

DR. HORN (CONT’D)
It’s okay, Eli, I promise.

Mom takes Eli’s hand.

16.

MOM
How about we do it together?

Eli’s scared but he acquiesces. Eli and Mom walk toward the
running shower and, hands clasped, gently touch the water.

Almost instantly, Eli loses himself in the feeling. The water
feels perfect, and it’s been so long since he’s felt hot
running water. He looks at Mom, can’t help but smile.

DR. HORN
See, safe.

Mom and Eli remove their hands from the water.

DR. HORN (CONT’D)
If you’re comfortable, Eli, I’m

going to have you wash up while I
show your parents to their room.
Okay?

Eli takes a long beat to think about being alone in the new
house. But the idea of a hot shower is a powerful convincer.

ELI
Okay.

The adults all smile, relieved.
DR. HORN

Take as much time as you'd like.

I’1ll have your Mom come and get you

when we’re ready.
CUT TO: Eli in the shower. For the first time he seems to be
relaxed. The water runs down his face.
INT. ELI’S ROOM - DAY
Eli exits the bathroom wearing the new clothes provided: the
same kind of clothes Dr. Horn was wearing. Neutral colored

long sleeves and pants.

He steps into his new room, alone in it for the first time.
He looks so tiny amidst all the space.

He opens a door to find an EMPTY WALK-IN CLOSET. He yells:

ELI
Echo!

“Echo” echoes back to him. Eli takes notice. He experiments:

8FLiX.com SCREENPLAY DATABASE

17.
ELI (CONT'D)
Ah!
It echoes back. He smiles, looks around slyly.

ELI (CONT'D)
shit!

“Shit” echoes back. Eli smiles, finally having a little fun.

He really lets loose now, a BIG SCREAM, coming from somewhere
primal, letting his frustration out.

ELI (CONT'D)
AHHHH!

But this time, there is no echo. Eli waits for one, but it
doesn’t come. He shrugs his shoulders. Whatever.

He heads for the door, almost makes it out when...

“BHH!"” ECHOES BACK! But it sounds different than Eli’s yell.
The scream sounds painful.

 

Eli startles, looks around him. He’s alone. A VOICE FROM
BEHIND HIM:

MOM (0.S.)
Eli?

Eli whirls around but it’s only Mom and Dad in the doorway.
MOM (CONT'D)
Dr. Horn is ready for you in her
office. Come on.
INT. THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY/OUTSIDE DR. HORN’S WING - DAY
Mom and Dad lead Eli up the staircase.

They reach THE LANDING. There’s a door with a keypad lock on
it. The entrance to Dr. Horn’s wing. Mom knocks.

MOM
Dr. Horn, we’re here.

There’s a silent moment while they wait. Eli’s nervous.

ELI
Mom, what’s she going to do--?

CLICK. The electronic lock disengages, cutting Eli off. Dr.
Horn steps out, a welcoming smile on her face.

DR. HORN
Right this way.
INT. INSIDE DR. HORN’S WING - DAY - CONTINUOUS

There’s another small hallway inside. There are three doors
leading out of it: one at the end, and two on the right side.

DR. HORN
At the end is my room. This is my
library...
Dr. Horn opens the door to THE LIBRARY. Eli and Mom observe
from the hallway: nothing special, bookcases on each wall
filled with medical textbooks. Leather chairs to read in.
They continue on to the last door on the right.

DR. HORN (CONT'D)
Right this way.

Dr. Horn opens it and they enter.

INT. EXAM ROOM — DAY

Eli scans the room. It looks much like a typical doctor’s
office you would find anywhere.

DR. HORN
Why don’t you have a seat here.

Eli breaks away from Mom, not without a little resistance,
and sits on the medical bench in the center of the room.

Dr. Horn pulls out a digital camera.
DR. HORN (CONT’D)
I’m going to get a picture for my
records. Can you smile for me? Big
smile?

Eli musters up a smile. She snaps a picture.

DR. HORN (CONT’D)
Perfect. Let’s get started.

CUT TO: Eli lies on the medical bench, shirtless, attached to
what looks like an ECG machine. Mom holds the lead wires.

Although not in pain, Eli looks uncomfortable and nervous.

Dr. Horn stares at the machine printout.

DR. HORN (CONT’D)

A minor but normal arrythmia due to
nerves, otherwise your vitals look
good. Let’s get those pesky wires
off you.

Mom carefully removes the lead wires attached to Eli.

DR. HORN (CONT’D)
Can you flip onto your stomach?

Eli obeys. Dr. Horn moves behind Eli, wheels a medical tray
along with her. He can see her reflection in the glass
cabinet in front of him.

DR. HORN (CONT’D)

In a normal healthy body,
antibodies are produced by a gene
found within the bone marrow. But
in your case, the gene that
produces those antibodies
malfunctions and ceases production.

Through the reflection Eli can see Dr. Horn removing items
from packaging on the medical tray, but his own reflection
obscures what the items actually are.

DR. HORN (CONT’D)

That means the first step to curing
you is isolating the gene, and
figuring out how to make it
function again. In order to do
that, I have to harvest the marrow.
The procedure takes up to an hour,
so I’m going to give you a general
anaesthetic which will put you to
sleep. When you wake up you’ll feel
groggy, and you might be nauseous
which is absolutely normal. Nothing
to worry about.

In the reflection Eli sees Dr. Horn raise a large hypodermic
needle. Eli grabs Mom’s hand, grips so tightly it hurts her.

DR. HORN (CONT’D)

Okay, I want you to count back from
one hundred for me, okay. You’re
going to feel a little pinch when I
give you the injection.

ELI
(shaky)
One hundred, ninety-nine, ninety-
eight...

Eli's face scrunches up in pain and he exhales sharply as the
needle enters his back.

DR. HORN
Okay, it’s all done now. Keep
counting.

ELI

Ninety-seven, ninety-six...
Eli's eyelids suddenly get very heavy.

ELI’'S POV: As the drugs begin to take hold, the WORLD LOSES
FOCUS. WE’RE LOOKING AT THE REFLECTION...and there’s A FIGURE
standing behind Dr. Horn, not belonging to anyone previously
in the room. We can’t make out who or what it is.

 

ELI (CONT'D)
(softly)
What...
And with that, he’s out.

CUT TO:

A BACKYARD SOMEWHERE.
WE’RE IN ELI’S POV AGAIN.

Shining sun, chirping birds. Picturesque. There’s a SLEEPING
DOG curled underneath the shade of a tree.

We WALK toward the sleeping dog, it’s back to us. We REACH
down, go to touch it when THE DOG VICIOUSLY SNAPS AT US...

CUT TO:

INT. ELI’S ROOM - DUSK

Eli wakes with a start. He’s disoriented, groggy from the
medicine. He rolls over and winces in pain.

INT. ELI’S BATHROOM - DUSK

In the mirror, Eli examines his hip where Dr. Horn harvested
the bone marrow. It’s bruised badly and sore to the touch.

INT. ELI’S ROOM - DUSK

Eli limps back to his bed from the bathroom.

He walks past his window, drapes closed. He stops in front of
it, stares at it like it’s something to be defeated.

And from somewhere behind it, he can hear A VOICE. He can’t
make out what the voice’s saying, but it’s intriguing. He
flips the switch on the wall; sounds of the outside rush in.

Ever so faintly he can make out:

LITTLE GIRL (0.S.)
Now that’s a good ‘un!

Eli draws the drapes open just enough to peer outside.

THE LITTLE NEIGHBOR GIRL is about twenty yards away playing
in the stream. She stands ankle deep in the water, next to
her is a big red bucket. She drops something into the bucket.

She goes back to staring intently into the water, searching,
then she suddenly LUNGES into the water with her hands, like
she’s grabbing something.

Eli stares at her, totally transfixed when -- SHE TURNS TO
LOOK AT HIM. Eli darts behind the drapes, embarrassed.

Before long, there’s a dreaded knock at the window. Eli does
nothing, too scared to open the drapes back up.

LITTLE GIRL (0.S.) (CONT'D)
I saw you lookin’ at me. I know
you're in there.

Eli stays frozen, doesn’t move. Hopes she’ll just go away.

LITTLE GIRL (0.S.) (CONT'D)
What’s a matter? You scared or
somethin’?

(a beat, then)
Fine, I’1l tell my daddy and he’11--

That gets Eli’s attention. He pulls back the drapes.

ELI
Wait. I’m sorry. I just heard your
voice and---

LITTLE GIRL
(laughing)
I’m just foolin’ with you! You
oughta see your face. Look like you
seen a ghost!

This girl is something else. Eli smiles nervously.

LITTLE GIRL/HALEY
I'm Haley. I live in the house over
there.

HALEY. While her body has not yet matured into womanhood, her
eyes have, and they’re sharp and knowledgeable. Her hair is
different than before, it hangs down on her shoulders instead
of in pigtails. She speaks with a slight mountain twang.

ELI
I'm Eli. What were you doing in the
stream?

HALEY

What’s that? You gotta come closer,
I can’t hear you.

Eli takes a nervous beat, closer to the window means closer
to the outdoors. But like all boys before him, he’d rather
risk his life than appear cowardly in front of a girl.

He steps closer to the window.

ELI
I said what were you doing in the
stream?

HALEY

Catching ‘poles.

ELI
Huh?

She reaches into the bucket and comes back with something in
her fist. She reveals it to Eli.

CLOSE ON: A SLIMY TADPOLE, flapping around, gasping for air.
HALEY
Tadpoles. They come out at dusk to
eat.

The tadpole slips out of Haley’s hands, SMACKS the window.
Eli startles, jumps back.

Haley LAUGHS, picks the tadpole up off the grass.

HALEY (CONT'D)
You scared of a tadpole?!

Eli's red-faced. He bumbles through an excuse:

ELI
No, I just...

8FLiX.com SCREENPLAY DATABASE

But in a moment, he becomes transfixed on the tadpole. This
squirmy, slippery little nothing is utterly foreign to him.
Without being aware, he moves closer to the window.

ELI (CONT'D)
I’ve never seen one that wasn’t in
a book, before. That becomes a
frog?

HALEY
Yep. Don’t look like one now
though, does it?

Eli shakes his head.

HALEY (CONT'D)
Come out and I’1l show you how to
catch ‘em. I got real good at it.

Eli shifts, semi uncomfortable.

ELI
Um...

HALEY
Oh yeah. You’re like, allergic to
the outdoors or something, right?

ELI
How’d you know?

HALEY
I just figured, since you're
staying here.

ELI
Oh, right.

HALEY
So you ain’t never been outside?

ELI
Yeah. Well, no...

Eli realizes he’s never really had to explain his condition
like this before. Maybe that’s because he’s never been around
a person his age.

HALEY
Well which is it?

ELI
I didn’t used to be sick. Or, well,
I guess I was but...

8FLiX.com SCREENPLAY DATABASE

HALEY
Are you always this confusing?

24.

Eli takes a breath, restarts. The only way to tell it is to

start from the beginning.

ELI
There was something wrong with me
before I was born. My Mom said the
doctors didn’t think I’d make it.
But I did. That’s why Dad calls me
Champ.

HALEY
Champ?

ELI
I beat the odds. Except...I guess I
kind of didn’t, because---
Haley finishes the story for him.

HALEY
You just got sick again later.

Eli nods. Haley shakes her head in disbelief.
HALEY (CONT'D)
Man, that sucks. If I couldn’t go
outside, I'd probably go crazy.

Eli shifts uncomfortably, Haley realizes:

HALEY (CONT'D)
Oh, sorry...

ELI
That’s okay. I don’t really
remember being outside, so...

He trails off. His lame excuse isn’t fooling anyone anyway.

HALEY
So like, you just have your friends
come over?

ELI
Well, mostly it’s just me and my
parents. There’s Dr. Horn too now,
and she seems nice.

HALEY
So what do you do all day?

8FLiX.com SCREENPLAY DATABASE

25.

ELI
I read a lot. I got an iPad, I can
get any book I want on it and--

HALEY
That sounds boring.

Haley lacks tact but she’s not antagonistic. And Eli knows,
in this case, she’s kinda right.

ELI
What about you? What do you do?

HALEY
I’m outside just about every second
of every day. Swimming in the
creek, skipping rocks, sometimes I
even just lay out on the grass and
stare up at sky. Don’t really do
anything, just lay there.

ELI
That sounds boring.

A joke! Eli’s starting to get more comfortable. Haley smiles,
which in turn makes Eli smile.

HALEY
You're funny, Eli. But I gotta go.
It smells like rain. See ya!

Haley takes off before Eli can even say goodbye. He stays
staring outside long after she’s gone, like a person watching
the credits play out at the end of a movie that moved them.

ELI (PRE-LAP)
Mom? Dad?
INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

Eli moves through the new house alone for the first time. He
walks slowly down the hallway.

ELI
Mom? Dad?

The hallway takes on a more ominous tone at night than it had
during the day. Every shadow is new to Eli, every creak of
the floor a surprise.

As Eli passes by each room...THE LIVING ROOM, THE KITCHEN,
THE COMPUTER ROOM...he looks into it.

8FLiX.com SCREENPLAY DATABASE

26.

All the furniture looks...perfect. Too perfect, like the
displays at an Ikea showroom.

CUT TO:

THE GOLD CRUCIFIX

Hanging on the wall. It’s a striking piece of work. You can
see the torment in Jesus’s eyes.

INT. FOYER - NIGHT

Eli stares up at the crucifix. He doesn’t like it, and for
good reason. It’s kinda creepy. Especially at night.

But for some reason, he can’t take his eyes off it. He stares
into the pained eyes of Jesus.

And...is it possible? The mouth of Jesus looks as though it’s
opening, ready to cry out! Eli’s about to scream himself
when, behind him:

DAD (0.S.)
Kinda spooky, don’t you think?

Eli JUMPS, whirls around to find Dad behind him.

DAD (CONT'D)
Sorry, champ. Guess I’m the spooky
one, huh.

Eli turns back around but the Face of Jesus has returned to
it’s normal state. Did it ever really move?

ELI
It wasn’t you.
(gestures to the crucifix)
It was that.

Dad moves to put his arm around Eli. They both stare at it.

DAD
Can't say I’m a huge fan, either. A
little grim, wouldn't you say?
(a beat, then)
You know what...

Dad reaches up to the Crucifix and removes it from the wall.
Looks at Eli and smiles.

DAD (CONT'D)
Dr. Horn said to treat this house
like it was ours. So adios Scary
Jesus.

Eli smiles.

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

CLOSE ON: Eli’s tired, baggy-eyed face as he stares
disappointedly down at his dinner...

A bowl of grey, uninspired oatmeal.
ELI
Oatmeal for dinner? Can I add some
syrup to it at least?
Dad sympathetically shakes his head no.

ELI (CONT'D)
Cinnamon?

DAD
Sorry, champ. No can do.

Eli begrudgingly picks up his spoon, swirls the grey gruel
around the bowl. Dad sits down to eat himself, neither of
them look very happy about it.

DAD (CONT'D)
Well, maybe we’ve got a little
brown sugar around, hmm?
Eli lights up at the prospect. Mom puts a quick stop to it.
MOM
I don’t think so. We have to follow
Dr. Horn’s recipes exactly. You
know that, honey.

It’s unclear which “honey” she’s referring to, but both Eli
and Dad look equally disappointed.

Dad leans over and whispers in Eli’s ear.

DAD
Sorry. I tried.

Eli pushes the bowl away from him.

ELI
Do you think Haley might be able to
come over sometime?

Mom was waiting for that question. She gets serious.

MOM
I don’t think that’s a good idea
right now.

DAD
Who’s Haley?

Mom gives Dad a look.

MOM
The neighbor girl.

ELI
But if we can all be in this house,
why can’t she? She can follow all
the directions and stuff.

Mom's worked through this in her head already.

MOM
I think right now we need to just
focus on getting you better. Once
that happens you can see Haley
whenever you want. Okay?

ELI

But what if...I don’t get better?
DAD

Don’t forget, Eli, you're The

Champ.

Dad lays the love on thick but Eli doesn’t bite. He slides
his bowl away from him.

ELI
I don’t think I’m hungry tonight.

MOM
Why don’t you get some rest, Eli.
You have a long road to recovery.

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Eli doesn’t get far before he hears Mom quietly yelling.

8FLiX.com SCREENPLAY DATABASE

29.

MOM (0.S.)
Do not make me be the bad guy here.

Eli stops to eavesdrop. He carefully walks backwards without
making a sound, peeks around the corner:

DAD
I’m not, but we both know a little
sugar isn’t going to hurt him.

MOM
We agreed, anything Dr. Horn says
goes. There needs to be a unified
front.

Mom and Dad, usually a singular force around Eli, are
behaving drastically different now that he’s not around.

DAD
Look at his face, Linda. He’s
miserable. We got him here, the
least we could do is try to make
him happy.

MOM
My concern is making him well, and
that’s Dr. Horn’s concern too. And
it should be yours.

DAD
Of course it is, but...

Eli’s seen enough. It’s hard enough to watch his parents
fight, let alone about him. He leaves the scene. Mom and Dad
never notice him.

INT. ELI’S ROOM - NIGHT

Eli lies in bed, on his iPad. Reads Pinocchio. But he pauses,
looks at the window. The drapes are open, he can see outside.

After a beat, he puts down the iPad, goes to the drapes, and
shuts himself off from the outside world.
INT. ELI’S ROOM - NIGHT - LATER

CRASH! A whip-crack of thunder forces Eli from sleep. It
takes him a moment to clear the fog of sleep from his brain.

For some reason, it’s burning hot. Eli wipes the sweat off
his forehead. He realizes he’s totally drenched in it.

8FLiX.com SCREENPLAY DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
30.

There’s A LOW RUMBLING coming from outside his window. It’s a
familiar sound, one we’ve heard before, but from where?

 

He sluggishly gets out of bed, curious to see.
He reaches for the drapes, pulls them apart...

And _ is greeted by A ROARING FIRE. Blazing hot, burning just
on the other side of the window.

 

Eli falls backwards, terrified. He hits his bad leg, the pain
momentarily paralyzing him. He watches the towering flames.
And if things couldn't get any worse...

The window begins to crack from the overpowering heat. They
Spider out, threatening to destroy the window.

 

 

Eli starts wheezing, the same thing we saw earlier. He
manages to pick himself up and bolt.

INT. VARIOUS HALLWAYS

Eli races through the house, as fast as he can with his limp,
screaming his head off, wheezing in between cries of help.

ELI
Help!...Mom!...Dad!...Help me!

He can’t get to Mom and Dad fast enough. He blazes with
lightning speed through the hallways, mad with panic.

ELI (CONT'D)
Help!

Eli turns the corner to take the stairs and runs SMACK into
Mom. Only, she’s on fire, burning right before Eli’s eyes!
She reaches out to grab him with a sudden burst of movement!

 

 

Eli screams and cowers in fear...but nothing happens.

MOM (0.S.)
Eli, it’s me! What’s the matter?!

When Eli looks back he sees Mom, as normal as she’s ever
been, with Dad just behind her. It must’ve been a panicked
hallucination in the dark.

DAD
What’s wrong?

He flips on the light. Eli looks deranged.

8FLiX.com SCREENPLAY DATABASE

ELI
The fire was breaking my window!

MOM
What?!

Dr. Horn hurries down the stairs from all the commotion.

DR. HORN
What’s happening?

CUT TO:

ELI'S PERFECTLY UNCRACKED WINDOW

Dad and Dr. Horn stand looking at it. No signs of fire
either.

INT. ELI’S ROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

The rest of the room however, is in total shambles. It looks
like a tornado went through it.

The adults look perplexed, just a shade under worried.

Eli stays back, hides behind Mom in the hallway.

MOM
Eli, what in the world happened in
here?

ELI

I didn’t do this.
Eli's as confused as anybody about how the room got trashed.

DR. HORN
Where did you say you saw this
fire, Eli?

ELI
Outside.

Dad throws his hands up in confusion.

DAD
Doesn't look like a fire came
through here, champ. A tornado,
maybe...And the window’s fine.
Look, you can see for yourself.

8FLiX.com SCREENPLAY DATABASE

ELI
But...I saw it.

Mom bends down to meet him at eye level. Their matching blue
eyes stare into one another’s. She recognizes something in
them, seems satisfied, stands and takes his hand.

MOM
Why don’t we get some sleep? You
can sleep in our room tonight.
We'll get this mess cleaned up
tomorrow.

As Mom takes him away, Eli stares back at the mess of the
room, the uncracked window and the unscorched grass outside
it. Was everything just in his head?

INT. LIBRARY - DAY

Eli sits with his parents in the leather chairs in the center
of The Library. Dr. Horn sits opposite them.

She makes notations in her notebook.
DR. HORN
Your parents tell me you’ve been
having nightmares. Recurring ones.
Would you mind telling me about
them?
Eli looks at his parents, a little uncomfortable.
Mom nods comfortingly. It’s okay.

Eli turns back to Dr. Horn.

ELI
Well, there’s the one with Prince.

Dr. Horn stops writing, looks up.

DR. HORN
Prince?

DAD
The Dog Formerly Known As.

He chuckles to himself. Mom swats at his chest.
MOM

We had to...get rid of him once Eli
got sick.

8FLiX.com SCREENPLAY DATABASE

DR. HORN
Ah. I see. Sorry, Eli, go on.

Dr. Horn goes back to the notebook.

ELI
Well, in the dream I’m not sick,
because I’m outside without my suit
on, and I’m not scared or anything.

DR. HORN
(doesn’t look up)
I see.

ELI
Prince is there, and I go to pet
him, but when I do, he gets real
mad and he tries to bite me. That’s
when I wake up.

Dr. Horn notes this in her notebook.

DR. HORN
What else, Eli?

A beat, then:

ELI
A dream about the fire at our
house.

Dr. Horn puts down her pen for a moment. Looks at Eli.

DR. HORN
That must have been really scary.
How well do you remember it?

ELI
I remember putting my suit on. And
Dad carrying me to the car.

Dr. Horn jots down another quick note before she slips the
notepad into a MANILA FOLDER labeled “ELI” on it.

DR. HORN
Eli, can you see how your
nightmares might explain a little
bit about what happened last night?

ELI
The fire?

Dr. Horn nods.

8FLiX.com SCREENPLAY DATABASE

34.

DR. HORN
I think you were sleepwalking. It’s
a rare side effect of the
treatment. Sleepwalking can occur
during various stages in the sleep
cycle. Yours happened during a
recurring nightmare. That’s why you
saw the fire. Does that make sense?

Eli struggles to understand, but he knows what to say.

ELI
I guess so.

DR. HORN
Good. Now...

INT. EXAM ROOM — DAY

DR. HORN
I believe I was able to isolate
Eli’s malfunctioning gene.

Eli’s back on the medical bench. Dr. Horn wheels around the
covered medical tray.

Mom and Dad stand excitedly by Eli’s side. But Eli just looks
nervous. He squeezes Mom’s hand.

DAD
That’s great.

DR. HORN
Yes, but that’s the easy part. I’m
going to introduce a modified
version of that gene into Eli’s
system.

MOM
And then he’s cured?

DR. HORN
Unfortunately not. The process is
gradual and has to be repeated
every few days, otherwise the body
rejects them. My goal is
essentially to trick Eli’s body
into making these genes on its own.

Dr. Horn unveils a syringe on the medical tray, already
filled with an opaque liquid.

Eli quickly turns away, shaking but trying to contain it.

DR. HORN (CONT’D)
This will only take a moment.

Dr. Horn rolls up Eli’s sleeve. She doesn’t draw any
attention to his fears.

DR. HORN (CONT’D)
It’s going to burn a little, Eli. I
wish there was something I could do
about that, but there just isn’t.
But the first time always hurts the
worst.

Eli squeezes his eyes shut, just shy of hyperventilating now.
MOM
It’s okay, Eli. In one-two, out
one-two. In one-two, out one-two.

Eli tries the breathing technique, but it’s not helping.

Dr. Horn injects the solution into Eli. There’s a momentary
scrunching of the face, but the pain is gone in a flash.

DR. HORN
All done.

MOM
See that wasn’t so bad, was it---?

All of a sudden, Eli’s face scrunches up again.

ELI
Ow.

MOM
Eli, are you okay?

The pain within Eli increases. His eyes well with tears.

ELI
It hurts. It hurts.

MOM
Take my hand, take my hand.

He squeezes down onto Mom’s hand like a vice. His strength is
shocking. It hurts her.

MOM (CONT'D)
(pained)
Just breathe. Breathe, honey.

Eli’s breath comes out in short, jagged bursts.

DAD
Doc, what--?

DR. HORN
I’m sorry, Eli, I know it’s
unpleasant. It’ll be over before
you know it.
Eli squeezes tighter onto Mom.

MOM
Eli, my hand.

Tighter still. Mom grows panicky.

MOM (CONT'D)
Eli. Eli, my hand!

DAD
(to Eli)
Take mine.

Dad holds out his hand for Eli to squeeze, but Eli doesn’t do
it. He squeezes on Mom’s hand tighter...tighter...

Dad tries to pry his hand off Mom’s before he breaks it...

And Eli releases. The pain dies down. Mom yanks her hand
away, rubs it and breathes a sigh of relief.

Eli bursts into tears. Dad hugs him while Mom tries to
console him through her own pain.

MOM
It’s okay, baby. It’s all over now.

Dad glares up at Dr. Horn, who’s a little shaken up herself.
DR. HORN
I’m sorry, Eli, there won't be
anymore pain now. It’s all over.

INT. HALLWAY - DAY

Eli walks slowly down the hallway towards his room, Mom and
Dad behind him. He’s totally drained from the procedure.

But then, ahead of him, something catches his eye...

A YOUNG BOY, clothing in tatters, enters an open room down
the hall.

Eli freezes, his body surges with adrenaline. This Boy
doesn’t belong here.
Dad bumps into Eli’s back, jarring him back to reality.

DAD
What the...?

ELI
Did...did you see that?

DAD
See what?

Eli looks up at Dad with fear in his eyes.

ELI
I saw someone.

Mom and Dad give each other worried glances.
MOM
Come on, let’s get you right to
bed.
INT. ELI’S ROOM - DAY
Eli’s still pleading with Mom and Dad as they tuck him in.
ELI

He walked right into the computer
room. How could you not have seen

him?
MOM

There wasn’t anyone there, Eli.
ELI

There was. I saw him!
DAD

Easy, champ.
ELI

But---

Mom shushes him.

MOM

Your eyes were playing tricks on
you. There was no one there. You’1ll

Dad kisses him on the top of his head.
DAD
I'll have a little something for
you to eat when you wake up. Love
you.

They leave Eli alone. But Eli’s adrenaline is way too high
for him to get any kind of sleep. Plus, the drapes are open.

Eli stands at the window, searching it, wondering how the
previous night could’ve all been a dream.

He notices something outside, an animal lying in the grass.
But there’s something familiar about this animal...

WE SLOWLY PUSH IN TO REVEAL...

The DOG from Eli’s dream, the exact one. Eli’s eyes go wide.
The dog lifts its head to look at us when...

HALEY POPS UP obscuring our view of the dog! It startles Eli
half to death, he screams.

HALEY
Geez you’re jumpy!

ELI
Do you see that dog?

Haley turns, looks.

HALEY
What dog?

She steps aside. The spot where the dog was is now just empty
grass.

ELI
You didn’t see...

Eli trails off. Was it real or his imagination?

ELI (CONT'D)
I'm awake right?

Haley screws her brow up in confusion, but moments later, A
MOSQUITO lands on Haley’s outstretched arm. She freezes.

HALEY
Hey, watch this.

Haley clenches her fist, tightens the muscles in her arms.

Eli watches her with a cold fascination, forgetting about his
vision momentarily.

ELI
What are you doing?

HALEY
When a mosquito is sucking your
blood, you clench your fist and
make your muscles real tight, like
this.

CLOSE ON: The mosquito sucks the blood out of her arm.

HALEY (CONT'D)
When you’re squeezin’ they get
trapped. And they can’t get their
little suckers out of you.

CLOSE ON: As the mosquito drinks, it grows larger and larger.

HALEY (CONT'D)
And they can’t stop drinking
neither, so they just get bigger
and bigger until...

CLOSE ON: The mosquito POPS like a balloon.
Eli flinches backwards as blood explodes onto the window.

ELI
Whoa! Gross!

HALEY
You still get a bite, but it’s
worth it. I hate them damn things.

ELI
I’ve never had one. I heard they
itch.

Haley cleans the blood off the window with her shirt.

Well I guess that’s one thing good
about living inside.

Eli can feel something off. Mom is acting weird.

He approaches the decontamination chamber threshold, doesn’t
want to cross it.

ELI

Please tell me what’s going on.

MOM
It’s time to go.

There’s something different about Mom’s voice this time.
Something...inhuman.

ELI
Mom...?

Suddenly, THE DOOR BEHIND ELI SWINGS SHUT, knocking him into
the DECONTAMINATION CHAMBER. Eli falls forward.

He looks up and we can finally see that it isn’t Mom at all
in there with him. It’s A LONG HAIRED WOMAN. Her gaunt face
is locked in a horrified expression.

Eli SCREAMS, scrambles off the ground and tries to open the
door back into the house. It’s locked, he doesn’t know the
code. He BANGS on the door as hard as he can.

ELI (CONT'D)
Help! Help! Mom, Dad, please help!

The door to the outside slowly opens. A sliver of moonlight
like a laser beam cuts through the darkness.

 

The wheezing starts. His throat closes up. He’s having
trouble taking in oxygen.

He spots his Germ-Suit hanging on the wall. Forces himself to
move for it. Inside his blood feels like cement, every
movement is a trial in and of itself.

The door opens wider. Eli can see the outside world: the
grass, the trees, the dust - the death. He tries to get the
suit down, but in his panic he can’t get it off the hanger.

His face grows bright red, he can hardly breathe. He finally
gets the suit down. He looks back at the door. It’s opening
wider and wider, almost all the way open now.

He collapses trying to pull his legs into the suit. His
oxygen is completely cut off. No more wheezing, just an open
mouthed gasp, a vacuum within his lunges. He’s seconds from
passing out when....

He's dragged back into the house! The door slams shut!

 

Eli sucks in clean air as he lies on his back. He sees his
savior, Dr. Horn, hovering over him, frantic and bewildered.

DR. HORN
Eli, what the hell are you doing?!

Eli’s consciousness begins to fade. This is all too much for
him. His vision becomes foggy, the sounds echo-y.

Mom and Dad come rushing downstairs.

MOM
What’s going on?!

DR. HORN
The sensor in my room went off. Eli
was about to leave the house!

Mom rushes to Eli’s side. Then he blacks out.

INT. EXAM ROOM - NIGHT

WE'RE IN ELI’S POV: Everything is still foggy, a minor blink
of consciousness...

MOM
(frantic)
He was outside, what are you going
to do?!
DR. HORN
I’m administering something
intravenously.

Dr. Horn reveals a syringe and injects it into Eli. Eli’s too
zonked out to be bothered by the needle. Mom holds his hand.

MOM

It’s going to be okay, honey. My
little fighter. It’s going to be
okay.

(sings)
You are my sunshine, my only
sunshine. You make me happy, when
skies are grey...

He blinks out again...

A HALLWAY

WE'RE IN ELI’S POV AGAIN. The same nightmare from the opening
scene.

We're RUNNING. We TURN to face the FLAMES, like a giant
FIREBALL coming straight at us. Somewhere deep inside the
fireball, it’s almost as if we can hear words:
EEEELLLLLIIIII...

INT. ELI’S ROOM - NIGHT - LATER

Eli wakes up, back in his bed.

Mom, Dad and Dr. Horn are talking in a circle. They don’t
realize he’s woken up yet.

DAD
(upset)
You said this place was secure.

DR. HORN
It is. I don’t know what happened.
DAD
Well that’s reassuring.
MOM
(to Dad)

Stop it. Now is not the time.

DAD
Then when is the time? When he’s
standing on the front porch?

Eli finally speaks, dazed enough that he didn’t register
their conversation.

ELI
(weakly)
Mom? Dad?

The adults wipe their faces of emotion, almost like they’re
coming in and out of different characters. Mom goes to Eli.

MOM
Eli, honey. How are you feeling?

Eli is still weak. It’s hard for him to speak.

ELI
We have to go.

44,

DAD
Go where, champ?

ELI
We have to leave now.

Mom and Dad look to Dr. Horn confused, why is he saying this?

DR. HORN
Let's let him rest, for now. We’1ll
keep a close watch on him. We'll be
right here the whole time, Eli.

Eli’s losing consciousness again.

ELI
This house...

MOM
Shhh. It’s going to be okay. Just
go to sleep.

Eli closes his eyes again. Mom runs her hand through his
hair, simultaneously shoots a concerned glance to Dr. Horn.

INT. EXAM ROOM — DAY

Eli is sitting up on the medical bench. The color has
returned to his face and he looks healthier.

Dr. Horn examines him while Mom and Dad watch. Although
tired, everyone is looking much less frazzled.

DR. HORN
Blood pressure’s good, temperature
has returned to normal. I think
we’re out of the woods. Eli, how do
you feel?

ELI
Better.

Mom and Dad breathe a sigh of relief.

DR. HORN
Alright Eli, now what can you tell
us about the other night?

ELI
Mom came into my room while I was
sleeping. She said we had to leave.

8FLiX.com SCREENPLAY DATABASE

MOM
I wasn’t in your room at all last
night, Eli.

DAD
Your mom was with me the whole
time.

ELI
I know. It was the house pretending
to be her.

Mom looks at Eli incredulously.

MOM
The house? Eli---

DR. HORN
It’s okay. Let him explain.

ELI
There’s something wrong with this
place. I think...I think the house
is haunted.

DAD
Haunted? Come on now.

Eli rises from the medical bench, indignant, wound up.

ELI
It used to be just the stuff from
my dreams but now I’m seeing
people, like that kid, and the
woman that pretended to be Mom.

Mom puts a gentle hand on him.

MOM
Calm down, honey.

Eli sits back down, but he’s not calmed.

MOM (CONT'D)
We'll get this sorted out. I’m sure-

ELI
They're trying to hurt me, Mom! You
have to believe me.

MOM
Eli, sweetie, nobody’s trying to
hurt you.

Eli balls his hand into a fist.

ELI
You're not listening to me!

MOM
We're listening, but you can’t
expect us to truly believe--

Eli bangs his fist on the medical bench. The outburst visibly
shakes Mom and Dad. They look to Dr. Horn to take control of
the situation, which she does.

 

DR. HORN
I believe you, Eli.

Everyone in the room is stunned by Dr. Horn’s revelation. It
takes the wind out of Eli’s sails.

ELI
You do?

DR. HORN
Of course I do. I believe that you
believe this house is haunted. But,
Eli, remember what we talked about
before? The sleepwalking, the
nightmares?

ELI
But it feels so real.

DR. HORN
Don’t dreams feel real while you're
having them too? You’re under a lot
of stress. I promise if you remain
calm, and try to relax, these
problems will go away.

ELI
But...
(realizes)
How did I get out of the house
then?

Dr. Horn answers without wavering.

DR. HORN
A short in the electrical system.
All it required was a simple
adjustment of the wiring. I was
able to fix it on my own.

She smiles, but Eli doesn’t find much cheery about it. He
turns his attention to Mom and Dad.

ELI
It was real. I’m telling you the
truth, you have to believe me.

DAD
I want to believe you but Dr.
Horn’s the expert. She’s been
through this before.

ELI
The others patients! They must’ve
seen stuff too!

DR. HORN
I've lived here for ten years, with
patients in and out, and no one’s
ever mentioned ghosts. I promise.

Mom and Dad appear reassured with the explanation. Eli, not
so much.

INT. ELI’S ROOM - DAY

Eli and Haley are sitting Indian-style on the ground on
opposite ends of the window.

Haley breathes on the window, fogs it up. She draws a TIC-TAC-
TOE board into the condensation. She marks “X” in the corner.

HALEY
Okay. Your turn.

Eli doesn’t move. He’s not paying attention, lost in thought.
Haley waves her arms to get his attention.

HALEY (CONT'D)
Hello? Anybody in there?

Eli comes to, points to a spot and she draws an “0.”

HALEY (CONT'D)
What’s the matter with you today?
You bored or something? We can play
a different game if you want.

ELI
If I tell you something, you
promise not to laugh?

HALEY
Alright.

Eli holds a beat, getting up the nerve, then:

ELI
I think this house is haunted.

Haley's reaction doesn’t change, but she utters:

HALEY
That’s funny.

ELI
You said you wouldn’t laugh!

HALEY
Well first off I didn’t laugh, I
said it was funny. And I didn’t
mean funny like that, I mean funny
like weird. The kid that lived here
before you, his name was Perry, he
said the same thing.

ELI
(shocked)
What?!

HALEY
Yep. I didn’t talk to him as much
as I talked to you on account of it
being winter, but the few times I
did see him he seemed mighty
spooked.

Eli rises to his feet. Paces around with excited anxiety.

ELI
What did he tell you?

HALEY
I don’t really remember much. To be
honest, I didn’t really take him
too seriously when he told me.

ELI
What about me? Do you believe me?

Haley takes a beat, really thinks about her answer. It’s
actually quite adorable.

HALEY
Well, since both ya’ll are saying
the same thing, but neither of you
met each other, I suppose there’s
got to be some truth to it.

Finally, a compatriot! Eli’s posture relaxes.

ELI
I wish it was that easy to convince
the people in this house. Dr. Horn
said I was hallucinating.

HALEY
You know, now that I think about
it, that’s the same thing Perry
told me she said.

ELI
So if he told Dr. Horn too, that
means...

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

ELI
-.-she’s a liar!

Eli ardently talks to Mom and Dad. They’re trying to remain
calm while Eli goes to town.

MOM
Calm down, Eli.

ELI
But she is! Perry, he was the
patient here before me and he saw
ghosts too. Haley told me!

DAD
Dr. Horn is...a lot of things, but
I have to believe her over a ten
year old neighbor.

ELI
No! Why aren’t you listening to
me?!

Eli's starting to unspool. He balls his hands into fists
again. Mom and Dad try to take him back from the edge.

8FLiX.com SCREENPLAY DATABASE

MOM
You need to relax, Eli. This is
exactly what Dr. Horn was talking
about---

ELI
No!

Eli SLAMS his fist down onto the glass coffee table with
rage. The glass tabletop shatters.

Eli stands there amidst the broken glass, unable to move from
shock. Dad snatches him up, panicked. Looks at his hand. Mom
just SCREAMS bloody murder.

INT. ELI’S ROOM - BED - NIGHT

Dr. Horn examines Eli’s hand while he’s in bed. There’s not a
mark on it.

DR. HORN
You’re very lucky.

The tone in the room is severe. Everyone is still shaken up.
Mom's eyes are bloodshot from her tears.

DR. HORN (CONT’D)

A wound that severe could have

quite possibly been unmanageable.
(reassures Mom)

But it’s okay. Everyone is safe and

unharmed.

ELI
I didn’t mean to. It
just...happened.

DR. HORN
It’s alright. I want you to take
this though.
Dr. Horn hands Eli a SMALL WHITE SLEEPING PILL.

DR. HORN (CONT’D)
It’s going to help you sleep.

Eli doesn’t fight her. He takes the pill with a glass of
water from his nightstand.

8FLiX.com SCREENPLAY DATABASE

DR. HORN (CONT’D)
Good. Now get some rest. Tomorrow
we have another treatment and I
want you to be as strong as
possible.

Dr. Horn smiles at Eli as she gets up, but it seems to be a
more strained smile than before, like she’s feigning.

Mom hugs Eli as tight as she can.
MOM
We love you so much, Eli.
Goodnight.
Dad comes around and gives him a hug too.
DAD
When this is all said and done,
we'll take you out to the ring and
get you some boxing lessons.
(then)
I love you.

ELI
Love you guys too.

They shut the door and leave Eli alone. From out in the

hallway, Eli can hear their muffled arguments.

INT. ELI’S BATHROOM - NIGHT

CLOSE ON: THE SLEEPING PILL drops into the toilet bowl.

Eli stares down at it with disdain. He never took it. He
flushes the toilet, the pill swirls down the drain.

INT. HALLWAY/KITCHEN - NIGHT

Eli sneaks down the hallway, on a mission.

He hears the adults’ voices coming from the kitchen. Dad
sounds on edge.

DAD (0.S.)
Hallucinations? You never mentioned
anything like that.
Eli sidles up towards the kitchen entrance to listen better.

He peeks through the door, WE SEE everything from his
voyeuristic angle:

8FLiX.com SCREENPLAY DATABASE

52.

Mom, Dad and Dr. Horn all sitting at the kitchen table.

DR. HORN
Each treatment is tailored to the
patient. And Eli has maybe the most
advanced case I’ve come across yet.
His reactions are going to be
unpredictable. We’ll have to manage
him one step at a time.

DAD
And what if you can’t manage him.
What happens then?

Mom shifts uncomfortably. She doesn’t like where this line of
conversation is headed. Dad knows it.

DAD (CONT'D)
I’m sorry, honey, but we need to
talk about this.

Mom gets stern.

MOM
No. We don’t. Because Dr. Horn, you
can manage it. Right?

DR. HORN
Yes.

Dr. Horn absently glances over towards Eli’s direction and he
darts behind the wall.

Eli waits a tense beat until he hears the conversation
continue. She must not have seen him. He peeks over again.

DR. HORN (CONT’D)

And the most important thing you

two can do is be calm around him.
He’s going to take his cues from

the two of you, and if he senses

dissention, it’s going to make my
job harder.

Dad takes a breath, nods his head. He holds Mom’s hand. Gives
his best facsimile of a happy smile.

DAD
Fair enough. I’1l keep it together.

Suddenly, Mom breaks down, starts sobbing. Dad holds her.

DAD (CONT'D)
Everything's okay. It’s going to be
okay.

Eli watches on, his face steeled but his eyes processing.

INT. ELI’S ROOM - NIGHT

Eli quietly shuts the door to his room so he isn’t heard. He
lies down on his bed.

He picks up his iPad and looks at the home screen. The
background is a FAMILY PHOTO taken from when Eli was just a
baby: Baby Eli, Mom and Dad, even Prince The Dog, posing,
looking happy. Nobody with any clue that life would throw
them such a curveball.

Eli begins to tear up...

.-.-But he has no clue the horrific events unfolding just
beneath him...

FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE FRAME, and without a decibel of sound,
THREE GHOSTS, gaunt and horrific, slither their way towards
Eli's bed on their bellies. One of them is a BALD MAN, the
other is THE LONG HAIRED WOMAN (from earlier) and the final

ghost _is an ELDERLY GAUNT MAN.

 

 

 

 

Eli stares at the picture, his mind someplace else...
The Ghosts slither underneath Eli's bed and disappear.

Suddenly, there’s a BUMP underneath Eli’s bed. It startles
him. His pulse begins to race. He bends over the bed, looks
down, but it’s too dark to see anything.

He uses the iPad next to him like a flashlight and with bated
breath, peers underneath his bed.

There's nothing there. The light shines clear through to the
other side. Eli lifts himself back up onto the bed, still
spooked, still unsure.

The bed shudders hard. Eli clamps down onto the comforter.
The iPad falls to the floor, flashlight pointing up.

CLOSE ON: The legs of the bed frame. They lift straight off
the ground.

Eli feels it, holds onto the comforter as if it provides some
sort of stability. The bed rises further up: six inches off
the ground...a foot...a foot and half...

8FLiX.com SCREENPLAY DATABASE

54.

Eli knows it’s time to move. He focuses in on the door - his
exit. Leaps off the bed and races for the door.

He swings the door wide and standing before him is the YOUNG
BOY. The same boy we caught a glimpse of entering the

computer room, but now we see him in full view. He’s no older
than Eli, his stringy blonde hair hangs off the Dead Boy’s
face, which is locked in a pained expression.

 

Eli startles so bad he falls to the floor. The Dead Boy
advances on him, Eli scrambles backwards.

The Dead Boy keeps coming, his eyes little black abysses
burrowed into a colorless face. Eli keeps moving back when
suddenly The Dead Boy stops, looks up.

Eli realizes with a sinking feeling what The Dead Boy is
looking at...the bed floats a few feet above his head.

 

There’s not even a second for Eli to move out of the way
before the bed comes crashing to the floor.

Silence. The room is still, no ghosts, no movement
whatsoever. Is Eli a goner...?

 

No. UNDERNEATH THE BED we find Eli, lying flat on his back,
the bottom of the bed frame mere inches away from his nose.

He turns to look -- one of the frame’s legs landed on top of
his iPad, smashing the screen but giving Eli the life saving
inches he needed.

Eli breathes for a beat, gathers himself, and notices
something directly above him...

Etched into a wooden slat above him is a crudely written
number: 5-1-6-6...

 

INT. ELI’S ROOM - DAY
Eli stares out the window in deep thought. He hasn’t slept.
The door opens...
MOM
Eli, honey, time to wake up for...
(then, surprised)
Oh, you’re already up.

She sees Eli’s broken iPad underneath the bedframe leg.

MOM (CONT'D)
What in the...?

She removes the smashed iPad from under the bedframe.

MOM (CONT'D)
Eli, what in the world did you do?

ELI
It was...

Eli trails off, holds a beat, debating whether or not to tell
her the truth. Then:

ELI (CONT'D)
-+.an accident.

Mom’s not buying it.

MOM
I know you’re upset, honey, but
destroying your stuff isn’t the way
to express it. This isn’t going to
be easy to replace right now.
(then)
Come on, it’s time to see Dr. Horn.

INT. OUTSIDE DR. HORN’S WING - DAY

CLOSE ON: The keypad above Dr. Horn’s doorhandle. The red
light above it indicates it’s locked.

Eli watches Dr. Horn’s fingers tap the keypad. An idea clicks
in his head. Although he can’t be totally sure from his
angle, it damn sure looks like her fingers hit 5-1-6-6.
The red light turns to green and Dr. Horn opens the door.
DR. HORN

Come in.
INT. EXAM ROOM - DAY
We’re in the midst of another gene treatment, this one looks

as painful as the first. Eli’s on the medical bench, entire
body locked up in excruciating pain.

 

Dad holds onto his hand, talking him through it.

DAD
...-It’s okay. You’re okay...

Mom’s holding back her tears as she watches her son writhe.

Dr. Horn stands beside Eli, empty syringe in her hand,
watching him with interest, like one might look at a lab rat.

HALEY (0.S.)
I couldn’t find nothin’ on her.

INT. ELI’S ROOM - WINDOW - NIGHT

HALEY
There was a bunch of other Dr.
Horns but none of ‘em was yours.
You’d think if she was so well
known, there’d be something about
her on the internet.

Eli and Haley are at the window again. His face is pale and
his cheeks sunken, like he’s turning into a ghost himself.

There’s a large red sack next to Haley.

ELI
Thanks for checking.

HALEY
How did your parents find out about
her?

ELI

She called us.
Eli and Haley let that sink in a moment before Eli continues:
ELI (CONT'D)
I think I figured out what those
numbers hidden under my bed are.
It’s a code.

HALEY
To what?

ELI
Dr. Horn’s wing.

Haley ponders the sentiment, then:

HALEY
Okay, say it is. What you gonna do
about it?

ELI

I’m going to see if it works.
Tonight, after everyone goes to
sleep.

HALEY
Good thing I brought this then.

Without missing a beat, Haley undoes the drawstring on the
large red sack and turns it upside down. Lots of metal poles
and red fabric fall onto the grass: tent making materials.

She starts rifling through it.

ELI
What are you doing?

HALEY

What’s it look like? I’m setting up
my tent. You expect me to sleep
under the stars tonight? I tried
that once, mosquitos nearly sucked
me dry.

(then, struggling)
Dang it, can’t see nothin’ out here
in this moonlight.

As Eli watches her struggle with her tent, and realizing she
means to stay by his side, a smile creeps onto his face.

INT. ELI’S ROOM - NIGHT - LATER

Eli’s spread his comforter on the floor and is sitting on it.
His back’s against the window, and he looks over at the

clock: 12:30am. Time to go.

Haley's red tent is fully set up now, the opening flush
against the window. Eli looks out at her, she’s fast asleep.

He debates for a beat, then knocks on the window to wake her.
She bolts up, surprised.

HALEY
I’m awake!

ELI
I’m going.

Haley rubs the sleep out of her eyes, gets serious as Eli
stands to leave.

HALEY
Don’t get caught.
INT. STAIRCASE - NIGHT

It’s dark on the staircase, Eli uses a flashlight to see.

8FLiX.com SCREENPLAY DATABASE

58.

He creeps up the stairs, careful not to make too much noise.

INT. THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY/OUTSIDE DR. HORN’S WING - NIGHT
He reaches the top of the staircase. Even darker here.
Eli finds Dr. Horn’s door with the light, moves towards it.

He takes a deep breath, hovers over the keypad. If the code
is right, this changes everything.

He enters the code slowly: 5...1...6...6. The split second
before the light goes from red to green feels like an
eternity. But the code works, the surprise shows on his face.
The door audibly unlocks - loud in the silence. Eli freezes.
Now what? Eli hesitates a beat, does he dare enter? Yes. He
gently pulls open the door and enters Dr. Horn’s Wing.

INT. INSIDE DR. HORN’S WING - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Eli very quietly shuts the door. He looks around.

He shines the light into the library, nothing in there but a
lot of bookshelves.

Dr. Horn’s room is shut, but the Exam Room door is open.

Eli holds here for a moment, shines the flashlight on Dr.
Horn’s room, wonders if Dr. Horn might still be awake inside.
It’s too late for that now though, he’s already here.

He enters the patient’s room, and shuts the door behind him.
WE HOLD on Dr. Horn’s door. From beneath the door frame WE
SEE _a light turn on.

INT. EXAM ROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Eli shines the flashlight around the room. Although we’ve
seen it before, it’s menacing in the darkness.

There’s a medical cabinet close by, Eli opens it. There’s the
usual first aid supplies, various medical instruments, some
pill bottles, but nothing that would help Eli.

Finally, at the far end of the room, Eli reaches Dr. Horn’s
desk. He scans the flashlight over it.

Time to check the drawers.

8FLiX.com SCREENPLAY DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
59.

He tries the top two smaller drawers of the desk but there’s
nothing there but various office materials.

He tries the larger left bottom drawer. It’s empty.

Finally, Eli tries the last drawer, but when he pulls on it,
it won’t open. He tries again, still nothing.

He shines his flashlight on the side of the drawer and
discovers a lock.

Eli scans the surface of the desk with the flashlight,
searching for the key. It’s not there, and Dr. Horn wouldn’t
be foolish enough to leave it anywhere Eli could get to it.

But something inside a pen container reflects the light of
Eli's flashlight. It’s a letter opener. He removes it,
examines the tip, the wheels in his head spinning.

He examines the lock again. It’s cheap, came with the desk
and made to fit one of those thin metal keys.

Eli takes the letter opener and inserts it slowly into the
keyhole until it stops. He tries to twist, but nothing
happens. He readjusts the letter opener, pulling it out
slightly and tries again.

This time, wouldn’t you know it, the lock gives.

He tries the drawer and it opens smoothly. Eli smiles, quite
pleased with himself.

Inside the drawer is a hanging file cabinet. He pulls out the
first file. It’s a manila folder with his name written on it.

He opens the folder, flips through it. Lots of handwritten
notes, most of them written in doctor’s chicken-scratch. It’s
impossible to read, except for the headings, which can be
made out clearly.

ELI
(reading)
Treatment One....Treatment
2....Treatment 3...

He reaches the end, and the last page contains a typed
document listing Eli’s specs: hair, weight, eye color, etc.
There's a_ small photo of him stapled to the corner.

 

Eli goes back into the drawer for more, but Eli’s folder is
the only thing there.

ELI (CONT'D)
Where are the rest of them?

8FLiX.com SCREENPLAY DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
60.

There’s a strange noise from the other side of the room. Eli
whirls around, shines his flashlight at the source. There’s
nothing there. Eli’s about to turn back around when...

A HAND REACHES UP FROM THE OPEN DRAWER AND GRABS HIM! Eli
SCREAMS, his whole body lurches forward off balance, falls
into the open drawer.

 

Something beneath his hand shifts inside the drawer and Eli
hits something solid. He pulls his hand out from the drawer
and gathers himself. There’s no one else there.

He looks back inside the drawer and realizes the drawer had a
false bottom. He moves the false bottom away to reveal
another stack of folders.

Eli pulls the stack out and lays them on the desk. The top
folder is labeled “PERRY HENDERSON.” He opens it up. More
illegible chicken scratch except for the headings:
ELI (CONT’D)
(reading)
Treatment One...Treatment Four.
He flips to the last page, the specs page.

His eyes go wide...

The photo is Perry. And Perry is The Dead Boy that’s been
haunting him.

 

He quickly flips through the other folders. WE SEE THE
PICTURES OF THE PATIENTS, three of them have turned up as
ghosts so far: HELENA (The Long Haired Woman), VICTOR (The
Elderly Man) and HARRIS (The Bald Man).

There's a noise from outside the door. But this isn’t the
noise of a ghost -- it’s the sound of Dr. Horn opening her
bedroom door! She must've heard Eli scream.

 

It startles Eli. The folders slip out of his hands, spill
onto the floor.

WE HEAR her FOOTSTEPS coming towards the room - THUMP, THUMP,
THUMP, THUMP...

Eli scrambles into action. He rushes to pick up the folders.
...THUMP, THUMP, THUMP, THUMP...
He tries to remember which order they were in. Arranges them.

...THUMP, THUMP, THUMP, THUMP...

8FLiX.com SCREENPLAY DATABASE

Eli drops the folders into the desk. Shuts the drawer quietly
but quickly. Looks for a hiding spot.
..-THUMP, THUMP, THUMP. THE FOOTSTEPS STOP. THE DOOR OPENS.
Eli ducks under the desk, the closest place, and only, place
to hide. Clicks off his flashlight nick of time. He HEARS the

door creak open, Dr. Horn sticking her head in:

DR. HORN (0.S.)
Hello? Anybody in here?

Dr. Horn enters the room, turns on the lights.

DR. HORN (CONT’D)
Eli, is that you?

From her perspective, the room looks empty, just as she left
it. She enters the room anyway.

Eli squeezes himself into the corner as tightly as
possible...

And realizes the letter opener still sticks out of the cheap
drawer lock. Dr. Horn moves around the room slowly, snooping,
but she hasn’t noticed the drawer yet.

 

DR. HORN (CONT’D)
If you’re in here, Eli, it’s okay.
I won't be mad.

Eli very deliberately grabs onto the letter opener and twists
to lock it. He barely snatches the letter opener back in time
before Dr. Horn is at the desk.

Without bending over, she reaches down and tries that very
drawer. Eli tenses, certain she’s going to spot him...

But the drawer doesn’t budge, apparently satisfying Dr. Horn.
She turns to leave without more fuss and turns the light off
on her way out.
She leaves Eli, panting in the darkness underneath her desk.
ELI (V.0)
The Ghosts are her patients.

‘em?

Eli nods.

ELI
The treatments. I saw Perry had
four of them. Same with the others.
That must mean the fourth one
kills.

HALEY
And how many you had?

Eli holds a beat, then:

ELI
Today was my third.

HALEY
Oh my God! Eli, you gotta get out
of there. It ain’t safe anymore.

Eli shushes her.

ELI
I don’t think it ever was. But
still...I can’t yet.

HALEY
What do you mean, “you can’t?!"

ELI
It’s not exactly like I can just
walk out of here, Haley. Think
about it.

HALEY
I ain’t the one that’s not
thinking! Tell your folks what you
just told me, they’d have you outta
here faster than a spooked deer.

Eli snaps angrily at her.

ELI
I already tried that, remember?!

her hands on her hips: don’t you dare.

HALEY
Don’t you yell at me, Eli. I’m
trying to help you. And I can’t do
nothin’ from out here behind this
dumb window except talk some sense
into you, because right now you
ain’t got none.

Haley’s words affect him, he tries to relax.

ELI
I’m sorry.

HALEY
Sure are.

ELI

But look at it like this. My
parents trust Dr. Horn, and they
don’t believe me about The Ghosts.
Even if I told them what I told
you, Dr. Horn could just deny it.
They wouldn’t listen to me. It
might even make things worse.

Haley takes a moment to calm down herself. Eli’s reasoning
does make sense. She sighs, defeated.

Eli moves towards the window, gets as close as he can, no
longer frightened by the potential danger outside, and looks
Haley dead in the eyes.

ELI (CONT'D)
But if I had proof, something I can
show my parents that Dr. Horn can’t
deny, then they’d have to believe
me.

HALEY
And how you plan on finding that?

Eli thinks, doesn’t immediately know the answer. Then:

ELI
The Ghosts. I wait for them to come
back, and hopefully they’1l give me
another sign.

HALEY
Hopefully? Wait? That don’t sound
like much of a plan.

ELI
For now it’s all I got.
HALEY
How long can you wait.
ELI
I have three days until the fourth

treatment.
Haley shakes her head in disbelief.

HALEY
I guess I can’t stop you anyway,
huh?

ELI
(shakes his head)
Nope.
(then)
I can do this. I know it.

Haley puts her open hand on the glass, Eli does the same.
It’s the closest they can get to any physicality.

HALEY
Dammit, Eli. You better be careful.
And if you wind up a ghost, don’t
go haunting me.

INT. KITCHEN - MORNING
Eli, Mom and Dad eat breakfast. Eli’s got big bags under his

eyes from not sleeping, and he still looks sickly and pale.
He’s not touching his food.

DAD
Eat up, champ. You need your
strength.

ELI

I’m not hungry.

Mom and Dad shoot each other concerned glances, as they’re
wont to do.

DAD
Is everything okay, Eli? You’re not
acting much like yourself these
days.

8FLiX.com SCREENPLAY DATABASE

Eli looks up from his food, at Mom and Dad, their worried
faces looking back at him. He wants to tell them what he
knows, but he can’t. Not yet. He tries another strategy:

ELI
Can we just leave here? We can go
back to St. Louis.

Mom and Dad look shocked.

MOM

Eli, not this again.
ELI

Please?
DAD

Maybe you should go see Dr. Horn--
ELI

(yells)

No!
The sudden outburst surprises Mom and Dad. Eli reels it back.

ELI (CONT'D)
I mean, I’1l eat.

Eli unceremoniously spoons the grey oatmeal into his mouth,
chokes it down.

INT. ELI’S ROOM - AFTERNOON

The drapes are drawn and the light is off, so the room is
totally dark. Eli sits crosslegged in bed, stares blankly
into the darkness of the room, his eyes glazed over, lost.

He’s waiting for a sign from The Ghosts.

The door opens up, Eli comes out of his trance, hoping it’s a
ghost. But it’s only Mom.

MOM
Eli?

She peeks her head in and looks at Eli with concern.

MOM (CONT'D)
You've been in here all day. Why
don’t you come out with your father
and I?

8FLiX.com SCREENPLAY DATABASE

ELI
I’m busy.

MOM
Well, don’t you want the lights on?

She flips on the light and Eli recoils from the brightness.
Snaps at Mom like a hissing cat.

ELI

No! Shut them off! Go away!
MOM

Eli--
ELI

I said I’m busy!

Mom shuts the lights off. Eli turns back towards the darkness
once again, status quo again.

MOM
Remember Eli, we're here for you if
you need us.
But Eli doesn’t respond. He just stares into the darkness.

CUT TO: A clock. It reads 3:00am.

Eli's asleep where he was sitting, day clothes still on.
There’s a noise from somewhere in the room. Eli jolts awake.

 

He looks around the room, there’s no one there.

He blinks the sleep out of his eyes. He clicks on his
flashlight. Shines it around.

ELI
(to himself)
It’s okay. They don’t want to hurt
you.

Another noise, from above him. Eli whips the light towards
the sound and illuminates A GHOST crawling on the ceiling!

 

 

Eli gasps, startled. His hand shakes with fear, but he
doesn’t run. The Ghost retreats from the flashlight beam like
a cockroach, scuttles into the closet. The door SLAMS shut.

He keeps the quivering beam trained on the closet door, waits
for something to happen...but nothing does. He’s going to
have to open the door himself.

8FLiX.com SCREENPLAY DATABASE

Eli takes a few deep breathes, a futile attempt to calm
himself, and goes to the door.

ELI (CONT'D)
Hello?

There’s no response, as if Eli ever expected one. With a
shaky hand, he places his hand on the doorknob, holds it
there, still unsure. He tenses up his hand, ready to swing
the door wide when...

SKREEK! The sound of something heavy moving across the floor
behind him.

Eli whirls around, shines the flashlight onto the bookcase.
It’s been moved, about six inches away from the wall. Eli
steps towards it...

SKREEK! It MOVES again, this time in full view of Eli. He
jumps back, surprised. The bookcase begins to rattle.

It’s a heavy wooden bookcase, the power with which it shakes
is intimidating. Books begin to fall from the shelves. Eli
has to stand back, the bookcase rocks more violently now.

The shelves are empty of books now, the last ones crashing to
the floor, and with one final shutter it tips over. It lands
facedown with a HEARTY THUD.

Eli doesn’t know what to do at first, waits for something
more to happen. Nothing does. He shines his light over the
fallen bookcase and realizes:

ELI (CONT’D)
Is this...are you trying to tell me
something?

He checks everywhere, on the wall where the bookcase used to
be, on the back of the bookcase, even at the books that fell.
Nothing seems to give him any leads.

ELI (CONT'D)

There’s nothing here.
(angrier)

There’s nothing here!

Eli absentmindedly shines his flashlight across the room and
standing right next to him is Perry, The Dead-Boy Ghost! Dr.
Horn’s other now deceased patients are standing behind Perry.

Eli screams, falls backwards. The Ghosts stand still, but all
in_unison they point their fingers towards the ceiling.

Something GRABS him! He SCREAMS, swings his arms wildly. He
CONNECTS with something solid. There’s an AUDIBLE GASP in
front of him in the darkness. The lights go on.

And all of a sudden Eli’s looking at his own Mom, hunched
over in pain, holding her lip.

Eli's aghast, stunned.

ELI (CONT'D)
Mom? I...I didn’t...

Mom rubs her cheek, in shock more than anything. Dad angrily
steps forward.

DAD
Eli, what did you do...?

Eli braces for an explosion of anger, but Mom holds up her
hand, stops Dad. She isn’t mad.

She’s worried.

MOM
It’s okay. It was an accident.

She bends down again, looks into Eli’s eyes, like she’s
trying to peer inside him. It’s the same thing she did when
he complained about the cracked window.

Eli has a far away look in his blue eyes.

MOM (CONT'D)
I want you to see Dr. Horn.

Mom grabs his hand, and it sends a shot of adrenaline through
Eli that brings him back to his senses.

ELI
No! I don’t need to see her I’m
fine!

INT. EXAM ROOM - NIGHT

Eli stands in the corner, behind a worried looking Mom and
Dad. He uses them as a barrier between himself and Dr. Horn.

MOM
He’s not acting like himself.

ELI
I'm sorry, I’m just tired. Can’t I
just go back to bed?

8FLiX.com SCREENPLAY DATABASE

DR. HORN
Let’s have a look at you.
Dr. Horn pulls out a pen light and bends down...

ELI
No!

He forces Mom and Dad closer together, too scared to even let
Dr. Horn look at him.

DAD

What’s gotten into you, Eli? She

just wants to have a look, that’s

all.

Eli’s shaking he’s so scared. Dr. Horn backs off.

DR. HORN

Eli's right. Sleep is the answer

here. Go ahead, get some rest. We

can start again tomorrow.

INT. INSIDE DR. HORN’S WING - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Eli exits the exam room, Mom and Dad by his side. They look
worn out, concerned, over-stressed. Eli looks worse.

As he turns to leave, his eyes lock onto something that gives
him pause...

THE LIBRARY. Eli doesn’t quite know why at first, but he
can’t stop staring into it. Then it hits him.

All those bookcases. Is this the sign The Ghosts were giving
him?

CUT TO:

A KEYPAD

Fingers punch in the code: 5-1-6-6. The light turns green.

Eli looks around, making sure the coast is clear. Enters Dr.
Horn’s Wing.

INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Eli slips into the library, constantly watching his back.
There’s no door so there’s no way of concealing what he’s
doing.

He immediately goes to THE OAK DESK located in the corner of
the room. He had luck with the last desk he tried, so why not
again here.

There’s nothing on the surface of the desk except a desk lamp
and some meaningless knickknacks. He tries the drawers:
one...two...three...four...they’re all empty, they’re all
unlocked, and there’s no false bottoms. There are no secrets
to be found here.

He turns his attention to the bookcases. He’s growing antsy.
He doesn’t know what to look for, and time is of the essence.

The door to the exam room is still shut, so his parents
haven't left yet. But they could open it up any second.

Eli walks the perimeter of the bookcases, scanning the books,
looking for anything unusual. But it’s all just old medical
texts and publications.

He balls his hands up into fists, his unease turning into
frustration. He moves along the bookcases faster, searching,
searching.

He talks to himself, but also perhaps, The Ghosts.

ELI

(angry)
What am I supposed to find?

Maybe it’s the bookcases themselves! He goes to the one on
the end and examines it with a close eye. He looks at the
bottom, the top, he tries to pry the bookcase away from the
wall, but it’s too heavy.

ELI (CONT'D)
Come on. There has to be something.

Eli’s downright manic at this point, exasperated. He starts
to pull at the books on the shelves, perhaps hoping to find
some super villan-esque revolving door.

He finds nothing. He starts tearing down the books off their
shelves, no longer caring about making noise, or a mess, or
being caught.

He yells:

ELI (CONT'D)
You were supposed to help me!
FROM BEHIND HIM:
DAD
You got something against books,

champ?

Eli looks up to see Mom, Dad and Dr. Horn all staring at him
from the hallway.

Dr. Horn’s face is emotionless, but Eli knows. He’s caught.
DR. HORN
Bring Eli to my exam room please.
I'll be administering the fourth
treatment. Tonight.
INT. DR. HORN’S WING HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

ELI
No! Put me down!

Dad carries a flailing Eli over his shoulder.

DAD
Stop it, Eli. Calm down.

ELI
Don’t let her do it! Stop!

As Eli tries to fight his way from entering The Exam Room, he
sees something that suddenly stops him in his tracks.

It’s DR. HORN’S BEDROOM DOOR, it’s open just enough to see
inside.

And in the brief moment before Dad strong-arms him into The
Exam Room, he sees something...

THE GHOST BOY (Perry), inside Dr. Horn’s room, pointing an
object Eli can’t see. It’s a message.

 

 

Eli understands. He was looking in the wrong room.

INT. EXAM ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Dr. Horn is busily filling the syringe with liquid. She
doesn’t look at them.

8FLiX.com SCREENPLAY DATABASE

DR. HORN
On the bench please.

Eli kicks back into high gear. Struggles with all his might

ELI
Let me go!

DAD
Look, I know the treatments hurt,
but you can get through this.

ELI
No! Let me go!

Eli flails with everything he’s got. Dad can barely hold on.

DAD
Jesus, Eli, relax.

All Mom can do is stand by and watch in horror as the scene
unfolds around her. Dr. Horn can’t give Eli the injection
until he’s better restrained.

DR. HORN
Hold him still and I can give him
the injection there.

DAD
I’m trying!

MOM
Maybe we should wait...

DR. HORN
No. It must be now.

Dad gets a better grasp. He uses all his strength to hold Eli
down, and finally he’s successful. Eli’s lost the fight.

ELI
(out of breath)
No...please...she wants to...kill
me!

But it’s too late. Dr. Horn’s inches away from his arm with
the needle. Eli has to do something, it’s now or never.

He does the only thing he can. He bites down hard onto Dad’s
arm. Dad SCREAMS in surprise and pain, draws back, freeing
Eli.

Eli lunges forward, SHOVES Dr. Horn with all his strength.
Dr. Horn careens backwards, smashes into her desk. The
syringe flies out of her hands, breaks.

More importantly, THE ENTIRE BOTTLE of the clear liquid falls
off the desk and shatters on the floor.

Eli stands in the room, his adrenaline pumping, panting like
a wild animal.

CUT TO:

INT. ELI’S ROOM - DUSK
SLAM. Dr. Horn shuts the door to Eli’s room.

Eli puts his ear to the door, EAVESDROPS on the conversation
between Mom and Dr. Horn outside his door.

MOM (0.S.)
Dr. Horn, I don’t know what to say.

Mom sounds past the point of exhaustion. Dr. Horn, on the
other hand, remains eerily clinical.

DR. HORN (0.S.)
I have to go into town to replace
what Eli...
(stops, corrects herself)
..-what was destroyed.

Eli's eyes widen. Did Dr. Horn just say she was leaving?

MOM (0.S.)
Is there anything we can do while
you're away?

DR. HORN (0.S.)
Keep on eye on Eli. I’m not sure
how he got into my wing in the
first place...

Eli smiles.

DR. HORN (0.S.) (CONT’D)
...but I changed the code on the
door just in case.

Eli’s smile vanishes.
DR. HORN (0.S.) (CONT'D)

I'll be back tomorrow morning at
the latest.

The conversation continues but Eli doesn’t need to hear it
anymore. His whole plan, dashed to pieces with the change of
four simple numbers.

HALEY (V.O)
There's gotta be something you can
do.

INT. ELI’S ROOM - NIGHT - LATER
Eli lies in bed, staring at the locked door, his face
shrouded in darkness. Haley stands at the window, trying to
be productive.
Eli doesn’t face her when he answers.

ELI

Haley, forget it. She changed the
code. There’s nothing I can do.

HALEY
Think, Eli.

ELI
I can’t think. I just want to go to
sleep.

HALEY

Don’t say that. We’re so close--
Eli sits up, turns to Haley aggressively.

ELI
We?! What do you mean, we?!

Eli’s never been this aggressive with Haley. He looks crazed,
threatening; it spooks Haley.

HALEY
I just meant---

Eli stands, makes his way menacingly towards the window.

ELI
I’m going to die in here, Haley.
Just like all the others. And
you're going to still be out there
catching tadpoles.

HALEY
You're not going to die, Eli, don’t
say that.

8FLiX.com SCREENPLAY DATABASE

Haley’s trying to fight back tears at this point. Eli doesn’t
care, he’s lost all semblance of self control.

ELI
Why don’t you just get out of here?
I never asked for your help, and I
don’t want it now. So just leave me
alone and let me DIE!

Haley bursts into tears. She turns her back on Eli so he
can’t see her cry.

And suddenly, Eli sees not a tough country girl before him,
but a sad, scared kid, like himself. Which is probably what
she’s been all along.

It sucks his anger away like a vacuum.

ELI (CONT'D)

Haley, I’m sorry. Don’t cry. I
didn’t mean it. I don’t know why I
said that stuff. It’s like I don’t
even feel like myself anymore.

After a few more sniffles, Haley manages to get herself back
together. She turns to face him.

HALEY
I wasn’t crying. A bug flew in my
eye.

Even with all that’s happening, Eli manages a brief smile,
Haley back to her old self again.

ELI
What should I do, Haley? I can’t be
in this house another second.

HALEY
Well, you were able to get in her
wing before.

ELI
Yeah, but that’s because The Ghosts
helped---
Eli cuts himself off. Whatever he realized, Haley did too.

HALEY
It’s worth a try.

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

Eli creeps through the hallway. It’s dark, and he doesn’t
dare turn on the light. He’s got his flashlight with him.

Listens for the sound of Mom and Dad. It’s all quiet. The
coast is clear.

He heads for the stairs.

INT. HALLWAY/KITCHEN - NIGHT

The kitchen light is on and Eli stops beside the doorway. If
someone’s in there, he might be spotted. He peers inside...

And there’s DAD, sitting at the kitchen table, staying watch.
But, something looks odd. Eli realizes, HE’S ASLEEP.

As long as Eli’s quiet enough, he should be able to get past
Dad no problem.

He moves.

INT. OUTSIDE MOM AND DAD’S BEDROOM —- SECOND FLOOR - NIGHT

Eli very quietly puts his ear up to Mom and Dad’s door,
listens in. No sounds from within. Mom must be asleep too.

He makes his move up to Dr. Horn’s wing.

INT. THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY/OUTSIDE DR. HORN’S WING - NIGHT
The RED LIGHT on the keypad stands out in the darkness.

Eli stands at the door. He doesn’t really know how to begin.
He looks towards the ceiling, like that’1l help.

ELI
Um, it’s Eli. I need your help. I
need you to unlock the door.

Eli stares at the red light, waiting for it to go green. It
doesn’t. Eli tries again, more conviction this time:

ELI (CONT'D)
I don’t know if you can hear me,
but I really, really need you to
open the door.

Still just red light. Eli closes his eyes, one final try.

ELI (CONT'D)
If I can’t get in here, I’m going
to die. So please, I’m going to
open my eyes, and please let this
light be green. This is my last
chance. Please--

THE GHOST BOY (Perry) passes in FRONT OF FRAME, practically a
blur. Eli doesn’t see it because his eyes are closed.

But he opens them now...

And the light is green. Eli could cry he’s so happy. But
there’s no time for that. He quietly opens the door...

The Ghost Boy (Perry), stands motionless on the other end.
Eli doesn’t move, fear and excitement coursing through him.
After all, there’s a dead child standing before him, friendly
or not.

INT. DR. HORN’S ROOM - NIGHT

Dr. Horn’s room is tiny, even in the darkness Eli can tell.
He stands in the door, shines the flashlight around: the
place is bare, frightfully so. Like someplace a squatter

might sleep, or a crazy person.

In place of a bed there’s an army style cot, nothing more
than a sheet for a blanket. THE HOLY BIBLE lies on top.

And so far, that’s the only thing in the place...until Eli
shines his light on a_lone bookcase against a wall.

The bookcase is completely empty, and Eli examines it more
closely with the light. He uses the underside of an empty
shelf to lift the entire thing. It’s heavy but not bad, and
he moves the bookcase a few feet over to the right.

When he steps away, what he sees shocks him...

Behind the bookcase is a dark hallway, a black abyss that
begs to be left alone, to turn away from and never look back.

 

A Ghost (Perry, again) stands at the other end of the secret
hallway, in front of a door, a big red symbol painted on it
we can’t make out. It doesn’t startle Eli this time.

8FLiX.com SCREENPLAY DATABASE

78.

INT. DARK HALLWAY - DAY - CONTINUOUS

Eli enters the hallway, towards the door. When he gets close
enough he can make out the symbol. It’s a_snake, coiled ina

circle, devouring it’s own tail. The technical term is
OUROBORUS, but Eli doesn’t know that.

 

Eli's adrenaline skyrockets. This is it, this is what he was
meant to find.

His heart is beating out of his chest. The sound of his
quickened breaths echo in the hallway. Eli pushes the door
open slightly; speckles of dust dance about in the beam of

his flashlight from within.

 

He steps backwards, frightened, covers up his face with his
hands, terrified to breath. He looks back out towards the
hallway he came from; going out now would mean failure and
certain death. He came too far to quit now.

After a contemplative beat, Eli pushes his t-shirt over the
bridge of his nose. It’s no hazmat suit, but it’1l have to
do. He opens the door the rest of the way and enters.

INT. OUROBORUS ROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

The room’s nothing but a big concrete square. There’s a bare
lightbulb hanging in the center of the room, Eli clicks it
on. It casts an ugly yellow glow.

Eli doesn’t need the flashlight anymore so he turns it off.
Ahead of him, painted on the floor, is a A LARGE OUROBORUS.
Within the circle is a OLD WOODEN CHEST, about six feet long
and four feet wide.

ELI
Is this it? Is this what you wanted
me to find?

At first, it appears as though Eli is speaking to himself.
But Eli turns his head, THE CAMERA PANS WITH HIM, to REVEAL
Perry standing next to him.

Eli steps into the circle of The Ouroborus, looks back and
Perry is gone.

The chest is covered in dust. Eli grabs the handle with an
outstretched hand, careful not get too close. He opens
slowly, so as not to disturb the particles.

CRRRRREEEAAK. The sound the old chest opening fills the room.
It’s open now, but Eli can’t see inside from where he is.

8FLiX.com SCREENPLAY DATABASE

79.

He gets closer, leans in. It’s still too dark to see, the
yellow light not bring enough.

He clicks on his flashlight, and points it inside the
chest...and the DEAD FACE of Perry stares back at him. Not as
a_ghost, but as a corpse - rotting, mouth agape. The eyes
have long since rotted out, leaving empty black sockets.

 

 

 

Beneath Perry's body are the bodies of the other patients,
most of them just skeletons by this point.

There’s a NOISE behind Eli. It must be Perry. Eli turns...

But it isn’t Perry. Someone’s running after him. It’s got to
be Dr. Horn, but we can’t make our her face.

 

 

ELI (CONT'D)
I got you Dr. Horn! I---

Eli aims the flashlight at Dr. Horn’s face...and WE SEE it
isn’t Dr. Horn at all...

ELI (CONT'D)
Mom?

Almost impossibly, it’s MOM who’s running towards him. Throws
Eli into confusion. What’s she doing up here?

 

ELI (CONT'D)
Mom...what are you...?

Mom stops at the door. Stares at Eli with a TEAR IN HER EYE.

MOM
I'm sorry, Eli.

She SLAMS the Ouroborus Door shut _on Eli! Eli races towards
the door tries to open it from the inside.

 

ELI
Mom, it’s me! There’s dust
everywhere, open the---

There’s an audible THUNK as the door locks from outside.
Eli’s eyes go wide: what the hell is going on?

He tugs at the door with all his might, pounds on it. The
shirt falls from his face, leaving him completely
unprotected. With each panicked breath he inhales the dust
billowing off the door and permeating the air.

ELI (CONT'D)
Please, let me out! Mom, please!

DAD (0.S.)
Linda, what...?

Eli uses the rest of his energy to plead with Dad, praying he
will help him.

ELI
Dad! Help...I’m...trapped...dust...

But there’s no help. Instead he HEARS:

MOM (0.S.)
He knows.

DAD (0.S.)
No. How?!

Eli can’t bang any longer. His vision begins to blur. He
slumps to the ground. What in the hell is happening?

He HEARS Mom and Dad’s footsteps heading away, leading out
towards Dr. Horn’s room.

MOM (0.S.)

Call Dr. Horn. Tell her to get back

here. Immediately.
The SOUND Dr. Horn’s bedroom door closing. Then, nothing.
All Eli can hear are his own shallow, raspy breaths.

He faints.

INT. OUROBORUS ROOM - LATER

Eli comes to on the floor, his face directly on the dust
covered cement. He picks his head up, and there’s a large
streak of dust covering the side of his face.

Yet, he can breathe just fine. He stands up, inhales deeply.
No problems at all. He tries the door again, still locked.

He looks around again, this room that earlier was his escape
plan has now become his cage.

FROM OUTSIDE, he HEARS the bookcase door opening, footsteps.
His breath quickens, he creates distance between himself and
the door.

The footsteps get louder until they stop outside his door. A
BEAT, then:

DR. HORN (0.S.)
Eli? Can you hear me? It’s Dr.
Horn.

She waits for his response, but he remains silent. Her voice
clinical now, monotone.

DR. HORN (0.S.) (CONT’D)
I have your parents here. They want
to speak to you.

MOM (0.S.)
Hi, honey.

Mom's wavering voice comes through the door. Eli winces, as
if the voice were a palpable thing, capable of physical harm.

ELI
Mom...Why are you doing this?

There’s a LONG BEAT, then:

MOM (0.S.)
Because you’re sick.

ELI
But...I’m not sick, am I?

More silence from outside the room. Eli stands at attention
now, his fear diminishing, but his rage building.

ELI (CONT'D)
I’ve never been sick. You lied to
me.

MOM (0.S.)
We had to honey. It--

Eli cuts her off. He moves closer to the door, his anger
growing with the ever increasing pulse of his heart.

ELI
Everything you told me was a lie.
Why did you lie to me? Why did you
take me away from my friends and
lock me up in here? Why did you
make me think I was going to die?!
Why are you trying to KILL ME?!

Eli grabs onto the door in a furious rage and pulls with all
his might. It rattles mightily but it’s not going to open.

ELI (CONT'D)
LET ME OUT OF HERE! I HATE YOU! WHY
ARE YOU DOING THIS TO ME? LET ME
GO! LET ME Go!

He’s so loud he doesn’t hear the adults retreating back to
the library. He does however, hear the closing of the
bookcase.

INT. OUROBORUS ROOM - LATER

Eli sits with his back against the wall. He’s drawing a crude
picture of Haley in the dust on the floor with his finger.

ELI
I should've listened to her. I
should've just left.

He rubs the picture out with his hand.

ELI (CONT'D)
But now I’m going to end up just
like you.

Again, WE REVEAL Eli's talking to Perry, along with the rest
of The Ghosts. In an odd way, they almost look like friends.

ELI (CONT'D)
Were your parents in on it too? Did
they trick you like they tricked
me?

Eli gets up, goes to the wooden chest. Opens it up.

8FLiX.com SCREENPLAY DATABASE

83.

ELI (CONT'D)
I guess you can’t get me out of
here huh?
Eli looks back at Perry and The Ghosts. They’re perched just
around the border of the Ouroborus. Eli looks down at his
feet, understands the symbol acts as some sort of boundary.

He shines his flashlight down into the chest, illuminates all
those corpses. All those bones.

It gives Eli an idea.

INT. OUROBORUS ROOM - LATER

Eli nervously paces back and forth. HE HEARS the bookcase
move, shuffling footsteps approaching.

He quickly opens up the chest, then hurries towards a spot on
the wall near the door.

He lays down with his back against the wall, making it look
like he’s passed out.

The footsteps stop.
Dr. Horn’s voice calls out from behind the door.

DR. HORN (0.S.)

Eli?
(beat)

Eli, are you awake in there?
(a beat)

If you’re awake, answer me.

Eli doesn’t move. He doesn’t even open his eyes. There’s a
long bit of silence, then some shuffling, then finally, the
THUNK of the door unlocking.

Dr. Horn sticks her head in.

DR. HORN (CONT'D)
Eli?

She spots Eli on the ground doing a swell acting job. Dr.
Horn thinks for a brief moment, then fully enters the room.

She quickly goes towards Eli and reaches down to check his
pulse. The moment he feels her fingers on his skin, his eyes
SHOOT OPEN.

8FLiX.com SCREENPLAY DATABASE

84.

He grabs her wrist and pulls her towards him, with his other
hand HE SWINGS something oblong toward her head. He connects,
there’s an audible THUD, and Dr. Horn stumbles backwards.

Eli rises, we see what’s in his hand. It’s A FEMUR BONE taken
from one of Dr. Horn’s victims. He goes at her again, strikes
her across the face.

Dr. Horn crumbles to the ground, unconscious. Blood flows
from out of her hair line and beings to pool on the ground.

Eli doesn’t wait around to see if she’1ll get up.

INT. STAIRCASE - NIGHT

Eli bolts down the staircase as fast as he can. He’s making
haste, but he’s noisy.

Mom opens her door, spots him.

MOM
Shit! Eli, no!

Eli doesn’t look back, just keeps running.

MOM (CONT'D)
Paul, he’s out! Stop him! Stop him!

Mom chases after him but her door slams shut, seemingly on
its own. Eli looks back, sees Perry holding the door shut.

Eli charges ahead.

INT. FIRST FLOOR - NIGHT

Eli reaches the bottom of the steps and makes a bee-line for
THE FRONT DOOR. The door unlocks (The Ghosts doing) and opens
slightly.

With freedom in sight, Eli pushes himself harder, puts it
into fifth gear. He reaches the door, he’s almost out of
there. He grabs for the handle when...

Dad grabs him from behind, wraps him up, pulls him away so
that they’ve reversed positions. Dad now blocks his path to
the door.

Eli's wild eyed, panting hard. The bone-club he holds makes
him look like a caveman. Dad talks calmly, but his eyes
betray that emotion.

8FLiX.com SCREENPLAY DATABASE

DAD
Eli, calm down. I can’t let you
leave. Drop that and we’ll talk.
Okay, son?

Eli looks at the LARGE OAK ARMOIRE next to Dad. The Ghosts
stand next to it, they mean to push it over.

ELI
You better look out.

Dad doesn’t understand what he’s talking about it.

DAD
Eli, everything’s going to be---
Dad looks to his right; the armoire falls, a potential
killing blow if it were to land on him. He leaps to safety as
the armoire crashes to the ground.

Eli turns back the way he came. Races towards his room.

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
Eli breaks down the hallway. Dad’s back up, chasing him.

As Eli runs, objects get swept up in his wake, come crashing
down as obstacles in Dad's path.

To Dad, it looks like these things are happening on their
own. But from Eli’s perspective, it’s The Ghosts helping him.

Eli navigates down the hallway, he can see his room. The door
is closed but Perry’s there. He opens the door for Eli.

INT. ELI’S ROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Eli bursts in his room. Perry slams the door shut. Eli runs
straight for the window. He can see Haley’s tent set up

outside. But that’s not his concern at the moment.

Using the momentum behind his run, Eli BASHES the window with
his bone-club as hard as he can.

The window absorbs most of the hit, leaving only a small
spidery dent in the plastic.

Behind him, Eli’s dresser crashes to the floor, blocks the
door.

Eli continues to smash the window with the heavy bone but
he’s making little headway.

INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE ELI’S ROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
Dad pushes on the door but it won't budge.
DAD
Open the door, Eli. You don’t
understand what's happening here.
Open the door!
INT. ELI’S ROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Eli keeps smashing. He’s losing energy fast.

Haley unzips her tent, confused. She sees Eli struggling,
quickly realizes what’s happening.

HALEY
Eli!

ELI
It won’t break! I can’t get out!

INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE ELI’S ROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Dad keeps trying the door. He puts his shoulder into it and
it gives slightly.

Mom comes racing to Dad’s side. She’s got Dr. Horn, who’s
bleeding pretty badly from the head.

DAD
Jesus! Did Eli--?

DR. HORN
We cannot let him leave!

DAD
Something’s blocking the door. I
can’t get it open.

Dr. Horn places her shoulder up against the door with Dad.

DAD (CONT'D)

3. ..1l...push!

 

The two of them push on the door with all their might.

INT. ELI’S ROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Eli’s run out of steam. The window is spidered all over, but
it’s not broken, and there’s no way it’s going to.

HALEY
(freaked out)
What’s happening? Where have you
been? I thought you might’ve---

BANG! The door slams from the outside. The dresser rocks from
the force. It’s not going to hold the door forever.

Eli’s drops the bone on the ground, defeated.

ELI
They're going to get in, Haley. You
need to go before they see you.

HALEY
I don’t understand, Eli. You’re
scaring me.

ELI
I’m not sick. I never was.
Everything’s been a lie, and my
parents are in on it. They didn’t
bring me here to fix me, they
brought me here to kill me.

Haley looks at Eli with big wet eyes. She’s speechless.

BANG! The door slams again. This time, the dresser actually
moves. Not long now.

ELI (CONT'D)
You have to go back home, Haley.

Haley tries to give Eli her tough-girl routine. It doesn’t
look so tough through tears, though.

HALEY
No, you can’t just let them--

Eli’s not affected.

ELI
There’s nothing we can do now. Get
your tent and go home. If they see
you they’1l kill you too.

BANG! The door slams again, moving the dresser even further
away. DAD'S HAND reaches through the space.

DAD (0.S.)
Help me push!

Dad grips the side of the door and pushes. Seconds until
they’re in the room.

8FLiX.com SCREENPLAY DATABASE

Haley stands her ground.

HALEY
I ain’t leaving you. Maybe if they
see me, they’1ll stop and--

ELI
(severely)
You have to go.

HALEY
But---

ELI
I said GO!

Eli SMASHES the bone against the window as punctuation. It
startles Haley, and for a moment, she’s frozen. But
eventually, she turns tail and grabs her tent.

She dashes away and disappears into the darkness. No trace of
her to be seen.

Which is good, because suddenly Eli finds himself being
lifted off his feet...

INT. EXAM ROOM - NIGHT

ELI
Let go of me!

Eli struggles against the weight of Dad as he holds him down
on the medical bench. Dr. Horn finishes strapping him in.

DR. HORN
Okay, that should hold him.

Eli struggles to break free but it’s no use, the straps are
too tight.

DR. HORN (CONT’D)
(to Mom and Dad)
Why don’t you wait for me in the
library.

DAD
But, what if---

DR. HORN
Please.

Mom and Dad acquiesce and exit the room, shutting the door
behind them. Dr. Horn locks the door.

8FLiX.com SCREENPLAY DATABASE

89.

Eli struggles against the straps, but he can’t break free.
Dr. Horn goes to her desk, rummages around.

ELI
Don’t do this. Please.
(then)
Please!

Dr. Horn ignores him, which ignites Eli’s temper.

ELI (CONT'D)
You're crazy! Why are you doing
this?!

Dr. Horn stops what she’s doing. Breathes out a deep sigh.
She looks more exhausted than murderous.

For the first time, she seems genuine, an odd time
considering she’s getting ready to murder Eli.

DR. HORN
A lot of people have called me
crazy. And maybe I am. I honestly
thought I could cure you.

ELI
You're not trying to cure me.
You've been poisoning me just like
you did the others.

DR. HORN
Eli, there’s so much you don’t
know. So much you can’t know. The
first three injections were Holy
Water and Tannis Root. I thought
perhaps on someone so young, it
might work this time. But...

She stops. Looks like she’s going to cry. Composes herself
and starts again.

DR. HORN (CONT’D)
I’ve come to understand, Eli, that
what you have is like...rabies.
Once infected, the only way to stop
the spread is to destroy the host.

Eli continues to struggle.

ELI
I’m not sick!

Dr. Horn turns her back on Eli again, goes back to what she
was doing. We still don’t see what.

8FLiX.com SCREENPLAY DATABASE

90.

DR. HORN
You are. You're sick of spirit.
It’s not your fault. You weren’t
given a choice. It was made for you
by your parents before you were
even born.

ELI
What are you talking about? Let me
go!

Finally, Dr. Horn turns around, AN OPEN BIBLE in one hand, A
SMALL CONTAINER OF LIQUID in the other.

But the most surprising bit, are the tears in her eyes.

DR. HORN
The children always suffer from the
sins of the parents.

She moves in closer to Eli.

DR. HORN (CONT’D)
I'll ask the lord for forgiveness,
Eli. I hope he grants it.

Her face grows cold, her eyes steeled. She GAGS Eli’s mouth.
She begins to read aloud from the bible:

DR. HORN (CONT’D)
Be sober-minded; be watchful. Your
adversary the devil prowls around
like a roaring lion, seeking
someone to devour.

She flings the liquid from the container onto Eli ina
crossing motion. The liquid SIZZLES against Eli’s skin. He
SCREAMS OUT in pain, his eyes bulging. Muffled screams from
beneath his gag.

 

Dr. Horn continues reading:

DR. HORN (CONT’D)
Put on the whole armor of God, that
you may be able to stand against
the schemes of the devil. For we do
not wrestle against flesh and
blood, but against the cosmic
powers over this present darkness,
against the spiritual forces of
evil in the heavenly places.

91.

She flings more acidic liquid onto him. He SCREAMS OUT once
more as the liquid burns into his flesh.

DR. HORN (CONT’D)
May Holy Water purify the skin...

She retreats back to her desk, the container of liquid now
empty. Reaches for something else...

DR. HORN (CONT’D)
And this dagger purify the soul.

Dr. Horn turns back around. This time she carries A CRUDE
LOOKING DAGGER, like something out of ancient times.

Upon seeing that, Eli manages to dredge up more strength,
more energy to fight his restraints. Except...nothing.

DR. HORN (CONT’D)
You are of your father the devil,
and your will is to do your
father's desires. Let God’s hand,
by my hand, send The Devil’s
servants back, back into the
sulphur lake from which they were
born.

She raises the dagger above her head, preparing to strike.
Eli's eyes go wide, abject terror in his face. This is it.

Dr. Horn closes her eyes, bends her head, appears to say
something not written within the bible.

DR. HORN (CONT’D)
Grant this boy your forgiveness
lord. He knows not what he’s done.

She brings the knife down, right into Eli’s heart...
But_her hand freezes, the knife does not pierce Eli’s skin.

His right hand has broken free of the straps. He’s GRIPPING
onto Dr. Horn’s wrist.

She can’t break free of his grasp. This is not the normal
power of an eleven year old.

Dr. Horn stares wide-eyed at Eli. He has a confused look on
his face, as if he isn’t sure what’s happening. Like someone
dropped blood in the ocean, Eli’s eyes turn from bright blue
to dark red.

DR. HORN (CONT’D)
God, no.

8FLiX.com SCREENPLAY DATABASE

92.

Eli looks up at Dr. Horn, no longer confused.

ELI
You were right, Dr. Horn.

Eli’s voice is calm and knowing, with the timbre of someone
far older, very different from the Eli moments ago.

ELI (CONT'D)
This house was never haunted. It
was never a problem...

The rest of the straps momentarily BURST INTO FLAME then
extinguish, leaving Eli free of his bounds.

ELI (CONT'D)
-.-It’s been me the whole time. I’m
the problem.

 

DR. HORN
(in pain)
Please...Eli...

Eli squeezes effortlessly down on Dr. Horn’s wrist and she
drops the knife, her face scrunching up in pain.

He SNAPS Dr. Horn’s wrist ninety degrees the wrong way. She
cries out, collapses onto the floor in pain.

Eli stands, places his hands out front and balls them into
fists. The room behind him EXPLODES into FLAMES.

 

Dr. Horn tries to crawl away but Eli easily catches her and
grips her around the throat. Easily lifts her into the air.
He stares at her like she’s a subject to be studied.

Suddenly, we're more afraid of Eli than Dr. Horn.

ELI
You should've killed me sooner.

Dr. Horn’s face grows red as her esophagus closes off. She
crawls at his hand with her good arm, but she can’t pry his
fingers away.

Behind Eli, the FIRE RAGES. His shadow looms, bigger than it
ever should be.

Dad bursts into the room, the door finally opening from one
too many shoulder charges. It doesn’t affect Eli. He casually
looks at them.

8FLiX.com SCREENPLAY DATABASE

MOM
Put her down, Eli. Put her down and
come to us. You don’t have to do
this.

Eli takes a beat, red eyes burning inside his head like tiny
embers. He looks at Dr. Horn, then back at his parents.

Smiles.

ELI
But I want to.

SNAP!

Dr. Horn’s body goes limp. Eli drops her to the floor,
nothing but dead weight now.

MOM
Oh, Eli. What have you done?

Eli advances towards them. His parents retreat back.

ELI
What am I?

MOM
You're our son.

ELI
No. Tell me the truth!

As Eli gets angrier the fire behind him grows.
Mom drops to her knees. Dad holds her.

MOM
We weren’t supposed to have
children. The doctors warned us
that if we did, there was a good
chance the baby wouldn’t survive.

DAD
We didn’t listen. We wanted to be
parents so badly. But when your Mom
got pregnant...

ELI
I got sick.

MOM
The doctors told us it was
incurable.

MOM (CONT'D)
There was nothing they could do. So
we did the only thing we could. We
prayed.

ELI
Prayed to who?

Mom and Dad don’t respond.

ELI (CONT'D)
To who?!

The FIRE ROARS behind Eli again, and that’s all the answer we
need. It’s not God that likes fire.

DAD
When you were born healthy, all the
doctors thought it was a miracle.
And for a while, so did we. But
then...

Eli remembers, we see it too...

EXT. BACKYARD - DAY

WE SEE IMAGES, BLURRY AND FAST MOVING. NO SOUND.

 

TODDLER ELI (4) walks up to A SLEEPING DOG in his backyard.

THIS IS ELI’S NIGHTMARE. NOT A NIGHTMARE AT ALL, BUT A
MEMORY.

Toddler Eli reaches out for the dog, but it SNAPS at him,
just like the dream.

Toddler Eli’s eyes turn RED, he grabs the dog by the head.

We HOLD THE FRAME ON Toddler Eli’s red eyes, but WE HEAR
sudden WHIMPER of the dog, and the crisp, clear CRACK of Eli
breaking its neck.

Mom sits up suddenly, takes off her sunglasses and stares at
Eli. He looks back at her, smiling, the dead dog in his arms.

 

Mom’s mouth opens wide, A SILENT SCREAM...

INT. DR. HORN’S WING HALLWAY - BACK TO PRESENT

Eli moves forward on Mom and Dad, backing them into the
hallway. The fire moving with them, all of it a part of Eli.

Mom looks at Eli with big, wet, pleading eyes.

MOM
We discovered if we kept you
isolated, you didn’t have
any...problems. But as you got
older, you began to change...

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

LIKE THE FIRST MEMORY, STYLIZED IMAGES. NO SOUND.

Eli’s running down the hallway. Away from the FLAMES BURNING
behind him.

WE’RE IN ELI’S OTHER NIGHTMARE. THE FIRE IN ST. LOUIS.

He trips and falls, the fire comes barreling towards him. He
looks back, scared, it’s going to get him.

But it doesn’t. Because once again, his eyes change, turn
blood red, and the fire stops just before his feet.

Mom and Dad stare at him, panicked. They see his red eyes and
stop in their tracks.

Eli’s smiling again. Mom and Dad aren’t.

INT. DR. HORN’S WING HALLWAY - BACK TO PRESENT

DAD
.«..We couldn’t control you anymore.

MOM
That’s when we found Dr. Horn. She
said she could cure you.

Mom and Dad bump up against the back wall. There’s nowhere
else for them to go. Eli stands right up close to them.

ELI
But she couldn't.

Mom finally gets the courage to stand. She takes Eli’s hand.
He doesn’t try to stop her.

MOM
We made mistakes, Eli. But we can
move forward. We can make it work.
Together.

DAD
It’s not too late.

Dad stands too, takes Eli’s other hand.

DAD (CONT'D)
We can still be a family.

The tears are freely flowing from Mom and Dad’s eyes now. Eli
stares back, and it looks like there might be humanity
glinting through his gaze.

They stand together, holding hands, a family unit desperately
trying to stay together in the face of horror.

Eli's eyes are a constant melding of red and blue, a fight
between the Eli that once was and the Eli that is now.

He can’t bear to look at their desperate faces anymore. He
points his eyes to the floor.

MOM
Please, Eli.

And Mom does the only thing she knows to truly calm him down.
MOM (CONT'D)
(sings)
You are my sunshine...my only
sunshine...you make me happy...when
skies are grey...
Dad joins in. Eli squeezes his eyes shut. Holds back tears.
MOM & DAD
.«..you’ll never know dear...how
much I love you...please don’t take
my sunshine away.
Mom gently lifts Eli’s head up by the chin.
MOM

Eli. We love you. You can still
make the right choice.

Eli opens his eyes. And they’re still burning red.

EXT. FRONT OF THE HOUSE - NIGHT

The front door opens, and Eli steps outside. The house burns
down behind him.

He takes a moment, breathes in the fresh air.

HALEY
Nice night.

8FLiX.com SCREENPLAY DATABASE

Eli looks. Haley is waiting for him ahead. There are no
police, no adults, just Haley, looking different somehow.
He isn’t the least surprised.
She stands to greet him. He stops ahead of her, like there's

still a window between them. From look at them now, one would
never guess Eli just killed three people.

ELI
Hi.
HALEY
Hi.
(then)
Catch.

Haley tosses something at Eli. He catches it, opens his hand
and looks. It’s a tadpole.

HALEY (CONT'D)
Thought you might like to finally
see one up close.

Eli studies, fascinated. Then...he squashes it in his fist.

ELI
So you're like me?

HALEY
(nods)
We're everywhere. Dad gets around.

ELI
Will I get to meet him?

HALEY
Eventually. How do you feel?

ELI
Good, actually.

HALEY
You were special, I knew it from
the second I saw you. You weren’t
going to let Dr. Horn kill you like
she killed the others.

ELI
Why didn’t you just come in?

HALEY
That’s not how it works. You have
to figure things out on your own.

HALEY (CONT'D)
More or less. A little nudging in
the right direction never hurt
anybody.

Eli nods. He’s relaxed, taking in the world as if for the
first time. He looks out:

ELI
Who are...?

Eli gestures to the front yard. WE REVEAL an entire yard full
of ghosts, all watching Eli and Haley, like patient dogs.

 

HALEY
Oh them? They’re everywhere. When
you get stronger you’ll be able to
use them better.

Eli spots Mom and Dad in the crowd, no longer living people
but burned up ghosts. They stare at him with the same blank
stare as the rest of them. They’re under his rule now.

 

 

 

Eli doesn’t react.
HALEY (CONT'D)
I have lots to teach you, Eli. You
and I are going to be unstoppable.
But first, I thought we might just
enjoy the fresh air.
She extends her hand.
Eli takes it.
They walk into the yard, The Ghosts part to let them through.

Behind them, the house burns.
