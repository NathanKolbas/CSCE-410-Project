FADE IN TO:
1 CREDIT SEQUENCE - BLACK VOID/NOCTURNAL CITY

We glide through a black void illuminated by searing,
ELECTRIC FLASHES in brilliant phosphorescent colors. The
blackness begins to rip and tear, granting us glimpses of a
nocturnal city.

WITH THE SOUND OF A WING FLAP, we sail through a gaping hole,
out of the electromagnetic dimension into an...

EXT. AERIAL VIEW OF WASHINGTON D.C. - NIGHT

We continue to fly until we pick out one particular jewel of
this nightscape: a stately office building. We descend
effortlessly...

EXT. WASHINGTON POST (EFX)
..-passing down through the roof and six empty floors.
INT. WASHINGTON POST NEWSROOM - NIGHT

On the seventh floor we hover near the ceiling, gazing down
on an office Christmas party. None of the celebrating workers
sense our presence as we snake through the labyrinth of
cubicles and glass cells, until:

POV DIVES INTO A PHONE LINE

traveling fast along the inside of the wires, erupting out of

the EAR-PIECE with a shrieking squall of feedback.
INT. WASHINGTON POST NEWSROOM - NIGHT

A MAN yanks the phone from his ear, wincing.

MAN
(off feedback)
What the hell was that?

The man is JOHN KLEIN, an up-and-coming reporter for the
Washington Post; intelligent, with East Coast good-looks.

JOHN
{into phone)
You still there? Okay, I missed that
spelling. With a ‘Y.’ Got it.
(correcting a name in his
story)
No. You're on the record. You can’t

JOHN (cont'd)
scrape your career off your shoe anyway.
At least do some damage on your way out,
see your name in the paper one more
time...Okay.

He clicks off the line, speed proofs his story, sends it on

its way. He’s done, and done for the day. He pushes
chair and stands up, kneads his back.

ED FLEISCHMAN, (29), rolls out of the next cubicle:
ED
John! “The Balkans Peace Council is
comprised of ten members” or “is composed
of ten members”?
JOHN
Twelve members.
ED
Oh. Right. Thanks.
Ed rolls out of sight.
John grabs his coat and heads past Ed’s cubicle.

JOHN
“Composed.”

As John walks passed, Ed rolls back out:

ED
What?

John disappears through glass doors into:

INT. NATIONAL DESK - CONTINUOUS

back his

Editor CYRUS BILLS, (65), a scarecrow with a cigarette,
scrolls through John's piece on the computer. His eyes never

leave the screen.

CYRUS
This will make them sweat, it’s good,
I'll lead with it...

JOHN

Great, I'll see you Monday.
CYRUS

What?
JOHN

I’ve got to go.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

CYRUS
You can’t - how does that look, my rising
star not showing up at the Christmas
party?

John smiles. This is the closest thing to a warm moment he
and Cyrus have ever had.

JOHN
Mary’s waiting for me.

Cyrus inhales deeply on his cigarette, watching John through
the glass doors weave his way out of the party.

EXT. COLONIAL-STYLE HOUSE - MCLEAN, VIRGINIA - NIGHT
A nice, well-kept house in an upscale neighborhood.
INT. COLONIAL-STYLE HOUSE - MCLEAN, VIRGINIA - NIGHT

John and MARY KLEIN hang back in an empty kitchen listening
to the REAL ESTATE LADY.

Mary Klein, (31), a beautiful redhead with a quick smile and
an irrepressible joie de vivre.

REAL ESTATE LADY
...It’s a steal at this price. We can get
it, but we’d have to make an offer today.
The owner’s moving fast.
Mary is ready to jump. John looks uncertain.

REAL ESTATE LADY (cont'd)
Think it over, I'll make some calls.

John and Mary wander up the
STAIRS

MARY
Oh, my God...I think I love it.

JOHN
(smiles)
I think you love it too.
She hits him; he laughs.

JOHN (CONT'D)
I don’t know if we can swing it.

MARY
Come on, let’s live dangerously.

They enter the...
MASTER BEDROOM. 10

John clicks a light switch up and down. A light blinks on and
off behind a door.

JOHN
What’s this?

They open the door.
A DARK CLOSET

Mary grabs John, suddenly excited. She kisses him. He kisses
her. Passionately. She pulls him into the closet, laughing.

John closes the door.

JOHN
Come on, let’s go, right here.

He slides his hands under her blouse. She shrieks with
laughter. They fall against the wall.

bats the bulb with its wings, casting large flickering
shadows.

John and Mary tumble out of the closet.
REAL ESTATE LADY
(blushing)
Oh, here you are.
John straightens his tie. Mary smooths her hair.
JOHN
Just making sure there's ample closet
space.
REAL ESTATE LADY
Good, good. Well I’ve got good news. The
house is yours if you want it.
John looks at his wife.
JOHN

(smiling)
We want it.

INT. UPSCALE FRENCH RESTAURANT - NIGHT 16
Through the window, John and Mary clink champagne glasses.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. RESTAURANT PARKING LOT - LATER 17
Long graceful tracking shot as John and Mary walk from the
restaurant to the Valet station. It's a moment of pure

happiness, ease, everything between them is right.

John hands the VALET his ticket. They bring the car. The
Valet hands the keys to John.

John tosses Mary THE KEYS and flops into the passenger seat.
He’s drunk. Mary climbs behind the wheel. They drive off.

EXT. STREET IN GEORGETOWN - NIGHT 18
Their car travels through night time Georgetown. They pass a
ROAD CONSTRUCTION SITE that looks like a brightly lit theater
set, a CLOCK TOWER that reads 1:30, and A BIRD SANCTUARY.

They turn onto a road overhung with trees. The street is
quiet and empty.
19 INT. CAR - NIGHT 19
IN THE SILENCE OF THE CAR, Mary turns to John...
MARY

You know what I kept thinking when we
were looking at the house today?

JOHN
It’s better than your sister's?
MARY
(laughing)
No...
JOHN

We should put a mattress in that closet?

MARY
Yeah! No, I kept thinking it felt like a
dream come true.

Mary stops at a light. John looks at her, the red light
reflecting off her eyes. She’s serious.

JOHN
C'mere.

She leans toward him, he kisses her hard.

MARY
Can we make it home first?

JOHN
Depends how fast you drive.

THE LIGHT changes.

MARY gooses the accelerator past the intersection,
suddenly...

A large SHAPE moves into the headlights. A BLUR, too fast to
see.

MARY sucks in a cry, hits the brakes, cranks the wheel. The
car slews sideways. Her head slams against the side window,
which spiderwebs.

JOHN flies forward. The seatbelt jerks him back. He flings
out an arm to protect his wife. The car jolts toa stop. He
sees Mary slumped forward against her seatbelt. She’s
unconscious.

JOHN (CONT'D)
-- Mary --

He touches her gent.y. No response, although she’s breathing.

JOHN (CONT'D)
Mary...come on...Christ...

He's afraid to move her. He pulls out his cell phone, dials
911, hand shaking.

JOHN (CONT'D)
(into the phone)
There’s been an accident...
He climbs out of the car into...
THE STREET 20

He goes to the front of the car, dreading what he might find.
But nothing’s there. He checks under the car. Nothing.

He stands in the street, looking left, right, forward. It’s
strangely empty.

In the background, a LOW HANGING BRANCH ten feet behind the
car rustles in the breeze.

The faint WAIL of a SIREN bleeds in.

INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT 21
John watches Mary behind a glass partition. She has been
readied for a scan. She’s fully conscious now, her eyes wide
and scared.

CAT-SCAN SCREEN

DR. DEBORAH McELHONE looks at the IMAGE OF MARY’S BRAIN. John
looks on, worried.

DR. MCELHONE
We're doing the CAT-SCAN to make sure
there’s no swelling or bleeding...
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. HOSPITAL CUBICLE - NIGHT 22
Mary is groggy, bandages on her nose. John holds her hand...

JOHN
You okay?

MARY
Yeah, I’m okay...
But she’s not. She stares off, pre-occupied, remote. Finally,
she looks at him:
MARY (CONT'D)
You didn’t see it, did you.
. JOHN
See what?
Mary holds his gaze for a beat, then looks away.
MARY
Nothing.
John’s hand tightens on hers.
JOHN
What did you see?
Mary doesn't answer.
JOHN (CONT'D)
An animal?
She shakes her head.
JOHN (cont’d)
What?
Silence.
JOHN (cont’d)
There was nothing, I looked.
Mary turns away, her eyes tense and worried.
JOHN (CONT'D)
Honey...
MARY
John...there’s something wrong with me.
INT. HOSPITAL - WAITING ROOM - LATER 23

John dozes in a chair. Dr. McElhone places a hand on his
shoulder; he snaps awake.

DR. MCELHONE
Mr. Klein? We need to talk...
24

EXT. HOSPITAL/DOCTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT 24
THROUGH THE OUTSIDE WINDOW INTO DR. MCELHONE’S OFFICE ...

We see John and Mary sitting at Dz. McElhone’s desk, as she
talks to them. After a long moment John slowly puts his arm
around his wife.

INT. HOSPITAL - WAITING ROOM - NIGHT 25

John sees Mary’s parents, WOODROW and RUTH DUNNING, rush in
carrying overnight bags.

RUTH
Where is she?

JOHN
She just went in for radiation treatment.

WOODROW
Radiation? Already?

John's voice is shaky, everything is happening too fast.

JOHN
They have to shrink it down as much as
possible before the surgery tomorrow --

RUTH
-- Tomorrow? My God --

WOODROW
-- Okay. So they're doing surgery. So
it’s operable, right?

JOHN
Yeah. It is.

WOODROW
Good. That’s good...

JOHN
-~ They're bringing in a neurosurgeon
from Johns Hopkins, he’s one of the best.

Suddenly, tears roll down John’s face. Woodrow awkwardly puts
an arm around John.

WOODROW
It’s going to be fine... She’s going to
be fine...

EXT. HOSPITAL - MORNING 26

In the cold blue morning light, snowflakes fall on the bare
trees outside the hospital.

INT. RECOVERY ROOM - SEVERAL DAYS LATER - MORNING 27

Mary's hair is gone and her head is bandaged from surgery,
but she’s more awake and alert than the last time we saw her.
John sits with her, a yellow pad in his hand.

JOHN
(reciting a list)
..-and a snow suit for little Gary - I’ll
call Jane and Doug to check the size.
(beat)
I think that’s everybody.

MARY
Are you sure you can do all this? Have
the stores wrap everything for you, okay?

JOHN
Would you stop? It’s fine. I can handle
this.

There’s a long silence. Then:

MARY
John... I’m sorry.

JOHN
About what?

MARY
About all this. I feel like I ruined
everything.

John looks at her; she’s talking about a lot more than just
Christmas. He takes her hand and smiles.

JOHN
You haven’t ruined a damn thing.

INT/EXT. CAR - DRIVING - NIGHT 28
John drives home lost in thought, retracing the exact route
they drove on the night of the accident. He passes the
CONSTRUCTION SITE, the CLOCK TOWER, the BIRD SANCTUARY.

He drives slowly, peering out the windshield, looking for

something, a reflection, a tricky shadow - whatever it was
Mary saw that made her hit the brakes.

CONTINUED: 28

As he rolls toward the exact spot, he sees the LOW HANGING
TREE BRANCH, stops the car, gets out.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT 29
THICK BLACK SKID MARKS scar the street underneath the branch.

John tries an experiment. He gets in the car, backs up forty
yards, guns the accelerator. Suddenly, he slams the brakes,
cranks the wheel. The car slews sideways - he is pulled up
short by the seatbelt. His face never even gets near the
window.

He sits back. Tugs on the shoulder harness. It locks up. So
why didn’t it lock up for Mary?

He climbs out of the car, searching the street - searching
for an answer, a reason. What did she see?

John stands behind the BRANCH and squints his eyes: the
branch BLURS and TWO DISTANT RED CONSTRUCTION LIGHTS shine
like EYES, forming the impression of a large looming figure -
was that it?

John walks to the front of the car. That’s when he notices
something on the front bumper. Something he missed completely
the night of the accident...

qT it. the bumper is scorched black.
INT. HOSPITAL CAFETERIA - NIGHT 30

CAMERA tracks along a chrome counter top, past stacks of
plates, cups of coffee...

JOHN (O.S.)
It’s called a Glioblastoma Multiforma.
Temporal lobe tumor. Very aggressive.

ED (0.S.)
Jesus Christ...

JOHN (0.S.)
According to Dr. McElhone it’s very rare.
Strikes one in 600,000. You've got a
better chance of catching the plague.

CAMERA comes to rest behind John and Ed sitting at the
counter. Now we can see their faces in A LARGE MIRROR behind

the pie rack. John is gray with luck of sleep. He forces out
the next words:

JOHN (cont’d)
The doctor says with a tumor like this,
most people never make full recoveries.

ED
Is there anything else they can do?

JOHN
They did surgery, but couldn’t get it
all. They’1l keep giving her chemo as
long as she’s strong enough. So far it’s
working, she’s looking a lot better, her
spirits are high.

ED
Did they say it’s a result of the
accident?

JOHN

No, turns out...it’s been there a while.

ED
John, if there’s anything I can do.

John just shakes his head. Ed looks at his friend. For the
first time, John looks fragile, truly lost.

John stares into the middle-distance.

JOHN
Three days ago we were house-hunting.
Last week I was up all night worried that
I‘d bounced the cable check. It’s like
one day, you’re driving in your car and
the universe just points at you and says,
“Ah, there you are. The happy couple.
I’ve been looking for you.”

CUT TO:

NEW ANGLE 31
Facing John and Ed at the counter. The camera slowly pulls
back, through the pies, back through the mirror itself. John
and Ed darken as we pull back, further and further into this
impossible vantage point until ... they disappear.

ANGLE from atop the Christmas tree. They all join hands
around the table.

RUTH
(praying)
...We are grateful for this meal, and so
grateful that Mary will be home with us
tomorrow, for Christmas dinner.

EVERYONE
Amen.

ANGLE FROM TABLE. Ruth looks at John. He does his best to
smile. The look of hope on Ruth’s face is too much.

RUTH
What time are we picking her up?

JOHN
They said sometime late morning, after
her chemo. But Ruth, you know it’s just
for a few hours, if she’s strong enough.

RUTH
I know...

They start to eat in silence.Suddenly, the PHONE RINGS...

They all look at each other, motionless. John moves into the
KITCHEN.

JOHN (cont’d)
Hello?

John has his back to Ruth and Woodrow. We watch his face.

DR. MCELHONE (0.S.)
John? It's Dr. Mcelhone.
(beat)
Mary had a seizure. We're trying to
relieve the pressure...

INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT 34
We track behind John as he runs frantically ‘own long
corridors. Suddenly he stops: Dr. McElhone =: standing with
her head bowed, the answer is written on her face.

And he knows...

INT. HOSPITAL - MARY'S ROOM - NIGHT 35

John slowly enters then pulls back a curtain, his face full
of fear .

Mary lies motionless on a bed.

John moves slowly towards her, his entire self somehow
diminished.

He sits at her side and grips Mary’s hand like he’1l never
let her go. His shoulders tremble with sharp inconsolable
sobs. He leans in close and presses his lips to her white
lifeless face; a kiss that will have to last him a lifetime.

EXT. HOSPITAL - LATER 36

Snow falls. A SQUARE OF WARM YELLOW LIGHT glows in the night -
it’s the window to the waiting area. From outside, WE SEE:

Ruth, who can barely stand, holding onto John. She lets out a
silent wail of grief; Woodrow watches them, unable to
comprehend what has happened.

Their images blur as we RACK FOCUS from the window, moving
back through layers of FALLING SNOWFLAKES.

DISSOLVE TO:
INT. MARY'S HOSPITAL ROOM - MORNING 37
The bed is empty. John slowly packs Mary’s belongings into a
RED OVERNIGHT CASE. He doesn’t know how to do this. What
about the toothbrush? The lipstick? He picks up her dress,
smells it. His eyes close.

ORDERLY (0.S.)
She knew.

John opens his eyes, puzzled. A middle-aged ORDERLY stands in
the doorway. The man smiles shyly at him.

ORDERLY (CONT'D)
She was drawing angels.

John says nothing. The man moves away. But now John sees the
NOTEPAD next to the phone. He reaches for it.

John’s face darkens. It’s not an angel.
THE NOTEPAD: a mad scribble of a figure, its bulging eyes

colored red with Mary's lipstick. What is it? John flips the
page. There it is again, and again, page after page of Mary’s

CUT TO
EXT. BENCH - LAFAYETTE PARK - DAY 38

The trees are leafless and the ground muddy. Mittened
joggers, dog walkers pass in front of a partial view of the
White House. John is sitting on a bench with his back to us.
He looks as though he’s been there a long time, as though he
may sit there forever.

The CAMERA begins to CLOSE IN on his back. John senses
something. He whips around and glares straight at us. The
CaMERA STOPS SHORT. John sees nothing, his face relaxes.

He turns forward again. The CAMERA starts EASING toward him
again. And very faintly now comes the hint of a RUSTLE.
Wings. Louder.

John strains to hear. He slowly scans left, right. Nothing.
The CAMERA is right behind him now. He can’t hear anything.
Not even the sudden WHOOSH, the single FLAP as the CAMERA
LIFTS OFF behind him, rising, leaving John down below,
smaller, smaller, until he’s just another unremarkable human
dot in the park.

FADE TO BLACK.
TITLE SUPER: ELEVEN MONTHS LATER - FADE IN TO: 39
EXT. ELECTRONICS STORE - NIGHT 40

We are watching a BANK OF TV MONITORS through the window of
an electronics store. Christmas decorations light the
foreground.

On it, John Klein addresses Tim Russert on “Meet the Press”.

Under JOHN there is a super-title: John Klein Washington
Post.

WE MOVE IN through the windows towards the monitors and hear
John talking:

JOHN
..-I think what we saw this year was an
apathetic electorate. Interest in the
campaign was low and voter turn-out was
the worst in forty years.

TIM RUSSERT
Couldn't that just be a sign of voter
satisfaction? People didn’t feel the need
for big changes.

JOHN
I don’t think so, Tim. I think people are
-- very unsatisfied with their situation.
And what made them so complacent is that
they didn’t see any viable options for
improvement. Rather than endorse the
status quo, they decided they’d rather
just stay home and be left alone.

As the monitors play John’s interview, MOVE INTO crackling
electric pixels and we:

DISSOLVE TO:
INT. WASHINGTON POST NEWSROOM - DAY 41

PULL BACK FROM TV SCREEN TO SEE: John’s face ~- he’s watching

himself on TV. Ed and other staff members look over his
shoulder.

TIM RUSSERT
Is there anybody out there you think
could fill out the bottom of the ticket?

JOHN
I’ve been hearing a lot of talk about
Russ McCallum.

TIM RUSSERT
The Governor of Virginia.

JOHN
Right. He's got the environmental record
they need. If he’s going to throw his hat

in the ring, look for him to announce by
next week...

As the segment ends, the staffers applaud. John laughs and
takes a bow. Now we get a good look at John. He’s healthy,
fit - but older. That confident sparkle is gone from his
eyes. He wears the past year like it was ten.

ED
Hey -- I told her to watch.

JOHN

Believe me, this will take, like, no
effort.

John moans.

ED (cont'd)
Come on, you can’t keep blowing this off.

JOHN
I’m not blowing it off, I’m interviewing
the Governor, I’ve gotta be in Richmond
at eight.

Ed pulls a pink message slip from his shirt pocket, hands it
to John:

ED
Almost forgot. Garrett Knox called. The
interview got bumped to tomorrow night.
John eyes the message slip, stuck.

JOHN
Ed, I don’t know...

ED
Look: she’s not Mary, not by a mile. But
you know what? No one ever will be. You
can’t hold that against them.

JOHN
I can't?

Ed looks at John; he's only half-joking.
INT. MARRAKESH RESTAURANT - NIGHT 42

Turkish dining. Pillows on the floor and belly dancers.
Kitsch heaven to Ed, John’s idea of hell.

With them: Ed’s partner PETER, (39), and GWEN, (33), pretty,
friendly, sophisticated.

They all eat hot, marinated chicken with their hands:

JOHN

ED

PETER
Wait ‘til he starts dancing.
GWEN
(to John)

When were you there?

JOHN
*88. Covering the earthquake.

GWEN
I just missed you. I was there in ‘89.
Peace Corps.

John looks at her, intrigued.

A belly dancer rotates toward them, beckons Ed to join her.
Ed downs his Ouzo and struggles to his feet:

ED
My whole life has been leading to this
moment .

Ed pulls Peter with him onto the dance floor. John smiles at
Gwen.

JOHN
So you were in Istanbul?

GWEN
No, it was this tiny village - you can't
even believe there are still places on
earth like it. These families raise
mountain goats - well, the men do - and
then the woman use the hair to make the
most beautiful blankets...

JOHN (CONT'D)
Places I know I could go and be happy the
rest of my life if I ever had to leave
Washington for good...

His voice trails off. A woman with RED HAIR steps out onto
the patio.

John's eyes take on a DISTANT LOOK - Mary is always with him.
Gwen watches John, waiting for him to continue.

GWEN
So - where are the other two?

JOHN
Other what?

GWEN
Places you could be happy.

JOHN
They’re secret! I'll tell you this: the
second one is very cold and you have to
speak Portuguese.

GWEN
And the third?

JOHN
I haven’t found it yet.

EXT. MARRAKESH RESTAURANT - NIGHT 43
John and Gwen walk from the restaurant to the Valet station.

A long graceful tracking shot reminds us of John’s last happy
evening with Mary. But tonight he’s with Gwen. They hand

their tickets to the valet.

JOHN
Well. It was nice meeting you.

GWEN

warm smile. Beautiful, smart, charming, funny...

GWEN (CONT'D)
If you can stand another cup of coffee...
I‘m just a few blocks away.

...Available. This woman is flawless. So why does John feel
absolutely nothing?

JOHN
That sounds great. But...

John’s voice trails off.

An awkward silence. The Valet arrives with Gwen's car. She
looks at him expectantly:

JOHN (CONT'D)
Look, I’ve got an early morning, so...

GWEN
Okay. Anyway, I really liked talking to
you. Call me, okay?

John nods absently. Gwen looks at him, his thoughts are miles
away. She gets into her car and drives off.

Ed and Peter come outside and find John alone, staring
intently down the street:

ED
Where'd she go?

John mutters.

JOHN
I don’t know.

INT. JOHN’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM CLOSET - NIGHT 44

A moth eats through a sweater in the dark. The closet door
swings open. John’s hand reaches in, pulls a chain. A naked
bulb burns white. John looks restless, irritated. He yanks an
empty suitcase from the top shelf, sending clothes and books
cascading to the floor. As he gathers them up, he’s pulled up
short by the sight of Mary’s RED OVERNIGHT CASE. It sits in
the corner where he left it almost a year ago.

He bends to his knees, moves his hand to the lock, hesitates,
afraid to unlock the past.

Finally, he lifts the 1: And there, staring up at him is a
reminder of all that he has lost. His hand touches her scarf,
lipstick, a brush still twined with her red hair...

John closes the case, slides it back into the corner. He
grabs his suitcase, throws it on the bed, jamming in clothes.

EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. STREETS - NIGHT 45

John drives quickly through empty streets, crosses the
fourteenth street bridge.

John is driving through the outskirts of Northern Virginia.

you later.
EXT. JOHN'S CAR - HIGHWAY - NIGHT 47

John is speeding down the interstate. Traffic is thin. He
passes under

THE LIGHTED SIGN FOR RICHMOND.

His car drives on into the night.

INT. JOHN’S CAR - LATER 48
John squints, trying to stay focused on the road as he drops
down a crest into a FOG BANK. He flexes his brakes.

Suddenly...

BLINK: Red lights flash across the dashboard. The car stalls.
EXT. JOHN’S CAR - MOMENTS LATER 49

The car drifts out of the fog onto the shoulder and comes to
a stop.

John tries to restart the engine.

JOHN
Come on, come on, come on...

He looks around. A dark, empty road. It doesn’t feel right.
He glances in his mirror.

HIS POV: Nothing behind him. Not another pair of headlights.
Not even the interstate.

John turns the key again. Silence. Not so much as the whine
of the starter. He switches on the headlights. Nothing. He
punches up the radio: dead. So is the car phone. John smacks
his palms on the wheel. He takes out his cell phone. It
beeps, shuts down. Drained.

He looks at his watch: 2:20 AM.

THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD

Distant lightning flickers hypnotically. It seems to be
moving from the ground up to the sky.

JOHN, mystified, gets out of his car.
EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT 51

It‘s a cold night, and he tucks his hands under his arms. He
should put on his coat.

THE LIGHTNING flickers violently, a few miles away. But where
is the thunder? It’s silent, eerily silent, so quiet John can
hear his heart beating.

Abruptly the lightning is extinguished. No stars. No moon. No
light at all.

JOHN feels a surge of anxiety. He’s alone at night in the
middle of nowhere.

JOHN
(low whisper)
..-Okay. Okay.

John shrugs on his overcoat and locks the car. He looks up
and down the road. Nothing. He walks in darkness.

Now he hears a strange low rumble. What the hell is that? The
sound vibrates the road below his feet.

Finally, he catches sight of a porch light on a distant
farmhouse. Turning up his collar and plunging his hands in
his pockets, John heads toward it at a fast clip.

EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT 52

John bownrds onto the porch. The house is dark, except for a

single : 1b. No use putting it off: He knocks on the door.
Waits. Waits.

A MAN opens the door. John smiles:

_ JOHN
Hi. My car broke down just up the road.
May I use your phone?

The Man stares at him, transfixed.

MAN
t's him.
This response makes no sense to John. A WOMAN steps into view
from the shadows behind the door; she peers nervously at Jonn
as the Man raises a gun:
MAN (CONT'D)
I've been waiting for you, you son of a
bitch.

The Man grabs John by his lapels and hauls him inside. The
door shuts hard.

INT. GORDON SMALLWOOD’S HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT 53
The Man, GORDON SMALLWOOD, (43), holds his gun on...

JOHN, who stands dressed in his overcoat in the Smallwood’s
mildewy, pink shower stall. Gordon is sitting on the tank of
the toilet, his feet on the closed lid. He keeps the gun
steady with his elbows on his knees.

JOHN
Look, I don’t -

GORDON
Shut up.

John shuts up. The two men watch each other, hearing the
tread of approaching footsteps.

The Woman - Gordon’s wife DENISE SMALLWOOD, (28) enters.

DENISE
Honey, Connie’s here.

John straightens slightly as

A WOMAN enters, wearing a sheriff's deputy uniform under her
unzipped parka.

She is SGT. CONNIE PARKER, (32) - blond, with keen blue eyes
and an honest face. She calmly assesses the scene:

John is enormously relieved.

CONNIE
Okay Gordy, why don’t you put away the
gun and tell me what’s going on.

Gordon keeps the gun trained on John. Connie places her hand
on the barrel and points it to the floor.

GORDON
This is the third night in a row he's
come around, this sonofabitch is stalking
- us -

JOHN
- Look, my car broke down up the road,
my name is John Klein and I -

CONNIE
- Let’s let Gordy finish, Mr. Klein.

Gordon speaks with a disturbing edge of fear in his voice:

GORDON
Two nights ago, at 2:30, there’s this
bang on the door. I get up, and here's
this guy, says he wants to use the phone.
But there’s something creepy about him,
right? So I tell him to get lost. No big
deal. But last night, at 2:30 on the dot,
guess who’s back?

CONNIE
You’re sure it was Mr. Klein here?

Gordon stares straight into John’s eyes:

GORDON
Absolutely positive.

JOHN
(under his breath)
This is crazy.

Gordon has good ears.

GORDON
(sternly)
I am not crazy.

JOHN
I didn’t say -

Connie holds up a hand:

CONNIE
(to Gordon)
So then what?

GORDON
So last night I warned him off my
property. I used the word “trespass,”
Connie. And he still came back.
(to John)
I had the right to shoot you on my porch.
You’re lucky I’m a Christian.

CONNIE
He'd have actually had to be inside the
house, Gordon.

GORDON
Fine. So tonight I figured maybe the dumb
fuck -~-
CONNIE
(sternly)
Gordon.
GORDON

-- might come back again, and sure
enough, here he is!

John turns to Sgt. Parker, taking pains to demonstrate that
he is the sanest person in the room.

JOHN
Officer, there must be some mistake. I’ve
never been here before in my life, I’ve
never seen these people, I live in D.C.
Check my wallet.

Connie calmly reaches into John’s pocket. She pulls out his
wallet, flips it open, spots his press pass. Her eyes jump to
his face.

CONNIE

INT/EXT. GORDON’S FRONT DOOR - LATER 54

John follows Connie to the door, not sure whether to be
relieved or worried.

CONNIE
You can wait for me outside, Mr. Klein.

John heads through the door without a word. Nothing makes any
sense to him.

CONNIE (CONT'D)
(to Gordon)
We’ll run a check on him. Anyone else
comes by, forget the gun, okay? Just call
me.

GORDON
Find out what he wants.

Connie squeezes Gordon’s shoulder. He goes to the doorway and
watches JOHN standing beside Parker’s Patrol car.

Connie turns to Denise. She pantomimes tipping a bottle to
her lips: has Gordon been drinking?

Denise shakes her head no.

CONNIE
So you didn’t actually see the guy
yourself, did you? Before tonight?

DENISE
No. But I heard the knocks, three nights
in a row.

EXT. GORDON’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 55
John sees them all step onto the porch. Then, in spite of the
odd circumstances, he watches as Connie, Gordon and Denise do
a distinctly small-town thing: They all say a friendly good
night to each other. Hug.

Then, as Connie walks towards John, Gordon shouts:

GORDON
You don’t scare me!

John sits next to Connie in the front seat. Connie pulls out
onto the empty road.

CONNIE
I’m giving you a ride to town. Unless you
want to sleep in your car. I can call a
tow for the morning.

They pull up behind John‘s car.

CONNIE

You probably want to get your bag?
JOHN

What?
CONNIE

You probably brought a bag.

JOHN
Oh -

He steps out of the cruiser.

EXT. ROAD - NIGHT 57
John crosses the road, opens his trunk, takes out his
weekender. He sees Connie on the two-way. He passes through
her headlights, climbs back in the Prowler.

INT. PROWLER - NIGHT 58

He's inside the car in time to HEAR the DISPATCHER over the
two-way.

DISPATCHER’S VOICE
-- man’s clean as Clorox, if you believe
the computer.

CONNIE
Copy. Thanks, Avis.

She clicks off, gives John a little shrug, shifts into drive.
Connie puts it as plainly as she can:
CONNIE (CONT'D)

You’re a long way from D.C. What are you
doing here?

CONNIE
We’re not on the way anyplace, Mr. Klein.

John is silent - he can’t explain how he got here. He stares
out the window. They’re passing through dark, quiet little
Point Pleasant. Population 6,000.

CONNIE (cont’d)
Relax. I recognize you.
(smiles)
“Meet the Press.”

JOHN
You saw that?

CONNIE
We're not all bumpkins.

Connie steers into the parking lot of a chain motel.

JOHN
So I’m not under arrest?

CONNIE
Well, you didn’t steal anything, you
didn’t hurt anyone, there’s no breaking
and entering...

JOHN
You had trouble with them before?

CONNIE
Gordy and Denise? Naw. They're good
people, but...
She hesitates, she knows she shouldn’t say this:
CONNIE (cont'd)
Things have been a little strange around
here lately.

She leans across him to open the door, but mostly to smell
his breath.

JOHN
I guarantee I’m sober.

He climbs out.

Where am I, anyway?
Connie points to a sign: WELCOME TO POINT PLEASANT.
She watches him walk into the motel.
INT. MOTEL - NIGHT 59
The sleepy, cranky NIGHT MANAGER runs John’s charge. John
concentrates on the road map stretched out under the glass of

the check-in counter.

His finger traces Washington to Richmond, a straight shot of
interstate, not more than 120 miles.

THE NIGHT MANAGER returns with John’s credit card.
JOHN
You think you could show me where we are
on the map?

NIGHT MANAGER
We’re right on the state line.

John traces to the Virginia/West Virginia border. The night
manager snorts with disgust. Tourists. Spare him.

NIGHT MANAGER
With Ohio.
He stabs a spot 400 miles away from John’s finger. Point
Pleasant is on the Ohio River.

John's finger hesitantly tracks the tiny spidery lines from
Richmond to Point Pleasant. There’s not even a primary road
between them. The room key clinks down on the glass.

JOHN keeps staring at the map. It’s not possible.

Prowler parked across the street: Connie is making notes

INT. JOHN’S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 61

The room is dark. John jerks awake, disoriented. He was
asleep in his clothes on top of the bedspread, which he has
cocooned around himself. He doesn’t know where he is for a
moment. Then he HEARS it. Faint BREATHING, someone BREATHING,
something BREATHING.

He reaches for the bedside lamp and switches it on. The
breathing stops. Silent now. Just a dull, empty, standard
issue motel room. John swings his legs off the bed and leans
forward on his knees. Bad dreams. He stands up. His cell
phone is recharging on the chair. He heads for the bathroom
for a glass of water.

INT. MOTEL BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS 62

John turns on the tap, splashes water on his face, looks up,
studies his reflection.

ANGLE FROM BEHIND THE MIRROR. WE PULL BACK: John’s image is
framed by the mirror. The sound of the running tap fades as
his image recedes, then disappears.

FADE TO BLACK:
EXT. OTTO’S CAR REPAIR - POINT PLEASANT - AFTERNOON 63

John is on his cell phone. In the background, OTTO’S head is
buried under the hood of John’s car.

JOHN

..Look - even if I was doing eighty the
whole way it would have taken six hours
to get here...

INTERCUT WITH ED FLEISCHMAN AT HOME: 64

ED
What time did you leave D.C?

JOHN
One o'clock. Besides, my gas tank doesn’t
even get four hundred miles. It’s one
thing to zone out while you're driving,
but to stop for gas too?

ED
John, I’m sure there's a logical
explanation for all this. Don’t worry
about your pal the Governor, I'll cover
you.

find a damn thing wrong with her.

JOHN
How much do I owe you?
OTTO
Nothing. I said I couldn't find anything

wrong.
This town just keeps getting weirder and weirder...

John spots Gordon Smallwood and ANOTHER MAN loading produce
onto a truck across the street.

John tosses his weekender into the back seat and walks
quickly towards Gordon.

Gordon eyes John warily, arms folded across his chest.

JOHN
(smoothly)
Mr. Smallwood, will you accept my
apology? I’m afraid I might have been a
little rude last night.

Gordon nods stoically.

JOHN (cont'd)
Listen, you're sure it was me who came by
those last two nights, huh?

GORDON
Look, mister, Connie called me this
morning, says you check out, and that’s
good enough for me. I'm perfectly willing
to let it go. But I don’t drink anymore
and I don’t lie and as far as I know, I’m
not crazy, so if you’re accusing me -

John pulls Gordon aside.

Long awkward silence. John shakes Gordon’s hand goodbye and
walks back to his car.

John pulls onto the road. As he circles past Gordon, their
EYES LOCK for a moment.

John leaves town the way he came in. He passes a sign
reading: “Point Pleasant City Limits”

EXT. GORDON SMALLWOOD’S HOUSE - NIGHT 67

The distant farmhouse is dark except for a single bulb
lighting the porch. No one is visible inside.

A MAN'S ARM RISES INTO THE FRAME

His watch reads 2:15 a.m.

WE PULL BACK AND SEE: John’s face reflected in his car’s rear
view mirror. He’s staking out Gordon’s farmhouse from the the

woods across the road.

The high grass bends as SOMETHING moves menacingly towards
the back of John’s car.

INT/EXT. JOHN'S CAR - CONTINUOUS 69

John cocks his ear. A rustling sound. Something is coming

too dark to see.

An SUV rolls quietly up beside him, headlights off.

I've had a few odd moments of my own
since last night. If there’s other people
in town feeling as confused as I am right
now, I'd sure like to know.

There’s something in his voice or his face or maybe both...

CONNIE
Okay. In the last few months people have
come up to me and reported seeing strange
things... And I'm not talking about the
town speed-freak, I‘m talking about
honest, hard-working, church-going folks.
I’ve known these people their whole
lives, and they seem downright
embarrassed to be bringing it up.

JOHN
Bringing what up?

CONNIE
It’s hard to explain.

this showed up in their backyard?
She tosses a sketch across the desk. John picks it up.

And almost passes out. It’s a drawing, of a man, with huge bug-

FLASHCUT TO:
JOHN'S MEMORY: 73
A yellow pad with Mary’s identical sketch.
FLASHCUT TO:
ACCIDENT SITE IN D.C. 74

THE LOW HANGING BRANCH with red lights for EYES flies rapidly
towards us.

Mary's drawing and the branch superimpose, and for a split
second, John sees it: Mothman.

BACK AT THE POLICE STATION: 75
John’s face is white.

JOHN
Who saw this?

CONNIE
A couple of people.

JOHN
I want to meet them. I need to talk to
them. Can you help me?
Connie looks into his eyes: He's dead serious.
EXT. LUCY GRIFFIN'’S HOUSE - DAY 76

John and Connie drink coffee at the kitchen table with Lucy
and her son NAT GRIFFIN, (24), a slacker living at home with
his mom.

NAT
It’s been going on about a month, every
Wednesday night at the poison plant.

John looks a question at Connie: “Poison plant?”

CONNIE
The hills around the Alanco chemical
factory. It’s a make-out spot.

NAT
(smiles)
Used to be. Now we just watch the lights.

JOHN
What lights?

NAT
I don’t know, man, just these weird
lights zipping around in the sky.

JOHN
What do you think they are? How would you
describe them?

NAT
Nobody knows, dude, the sky's just
totally freaking out.

JOHN
Only Wednesdays?

NAT
That's when they seem to show up.

Lucy refills their coffee cups. Connie takes out the bird-man

EXT. BACKYARD - NIGHT - FLASHBACK - MOTHMAN’S POV 79

We descend into the back yard, landing under the blue pine
tree. We watch Lucy through the kitchen window. She stares
back at.us, mesmerized.

LUCY (V.0O.)
At first, all I could see were these two
red eyes. I kept on looking at it, I
couldn't stop. I’ve never had that
feeling before, like I couldn’t move. The
only way I can explain is that the whole
thing just wasn’t right. I know that may
not make sense, but that’s the only way I
can put it into words.

BACK TO SCENE (PRESENT TIME - LUCY'S BACKYARD) 80

CAMERA rises, peering down at Lucy, John, Connie and Nat:

Lucy (cont‘d)
Then, I guess it saw me too, ‘cause all
of a sudden these giant wings just flared
out and it took off.

JOHN

Did you see it too?...

Nat shakes his head no.

John’s eyes fix on something. He walks over to the tree,
reaches out his hand, touches it. He runs his fingers along

the tree bark - a large section is scorched black.

JOHN (CONT'D)
Mrs. Griffin, I don’t mean to pry,
but...Have you had any headaches or
blackouts or anything like that recently?

FIRE CHIEF JOSH JESSUP, (55), a stout bulldog of a man sits
with John and Connie in the fire station while, in the
background, his men scrub the fire truck.

JOSH

I guess they started about two months
ago, the strange phone calls. All hours.
The first one was just a loud beeping

- noise. Now it’s mostly creaking, howling
sounds - and once, it was a man talking
really fast in some foreign language.
Maybe Swedish or something like that.

JOHN
Have you had the line checked?

JOSH

I even had our number changed. But before
I got a chance to give it out to anyone
the calls started again.

Connie points a flashlight as John and two teenagers,
C.J.(17) and HOLLY(14), walk up the crest of a small hill.
One of C.J.'s eyes is slightly puffy with a blotch of red.

FLASHBACK - EXT. DESERTED DIRT ROAD - NIGHT 85
It’s a starlit, moonless night. C.J. and Holly are naked from

C.J. (cont'd)
Oh, shit, it’s the cops!

But it’s not a police car, it’s a massive WALL OF SCORCHING
RED LIGHT hovering over the back window.

CJ and Holly stare up, terrified.

Holly tries to shield her face with her HANDS and BLOUSE.
That’s when she sees the Mothman: her hands form trembling
wings, red light pours through button holes forming two
demonic eyes.

HOLLY
Oh my god! Oh my god!

Holly lets out a blood curdling scream.

Suddenly, A LOUD WHOOSH. The light ascends into the night
sky.

BACK TO SCENE (EXT. DESERTED DIRT ROAD - NIGHT) 86
Holly is shaking. C.J. holds her close.

C.J.

- The next thing we know, it’s gone.
Just like that. We got the hell out of
there. Next day, both my eyes nearly
swelled shut.

JOHN
What did the doctor say?

C.d.
He couldn't explain it.
(pointing at his eye)
This one never healed.

JOHN
How long ago was this?

HOLLY
About two months.

They stand in the circle of Connie’s flashlight. All we hear
is the sound of four people breathing. Connie leans in close
to Holly.

Holly turns to C.J. He looks away. Blushing, she starts to
unbutton her blouse. She turns around as she slips it off her
shoulder. Connie brings up her flashlight. On Holly's back, a
PAINFULLY SCORCHED PATCH OF BURNED RED SKIN.

John steps closer to see it.

Connie looks at John - do you have enough proof now?

I’m Kevin Parker.

JOHN
(shakes his hand)
Glad to meet you Kevin.

INT. CONNIE’S KITCHEN TABLE - NIGHT 91

John and Connie have finished their meal. Kevin plays in the
next room.

JOHN
Connie, I want to thank you for helping
me out today. You put yourself on the
line for me. I appreciate it.

CONNIE
I’m not going to end up reading about all
this in the Washington Post, am I?
This is not exactly the kind of thing we
want to be known for.

John looks up; she’s smiling, but she’s also dead serious.
JOHN
No. Believe me. It’s not the kind of
story we usually cover.

They laugh together. Then, a beat of silence.

John pours the last of a beer -- half into her glass, half
into his.

JOHN (cont’d)
Say, do you have a video camera?

She gives him a curious look: is this some kind of kinky come
on?

CONNIE
Yes. Why?

EXT. HILLTOP PATH - NIGHT 92

A cold, clear night. John and Connie follow Kevin up a wooded
path. Connie’s camcorder hangs from John’s neck.

CONNIE
..-he lives up near Pittsburgh, does some
contracting. Kevin sees him a couple
times a year.

JOHN
Kevin must miss him.

CONNIE
Yeah, he does.

Kevin leads the way, just a few steps ahead of them. Connie
does her best to make this next sound nonchalant:

CONNIE (CONT'D)
And you? Probably dating some pretty
young congressional aide?

JOHN
Not exactly.
(a deep breath, then:)
I was married...and uh...

John searches for the right words. Kevin turns and stops.

JOHN (cont'd)
..-My wife died about a year ago.

CONNIE
I’m sorry.

KEVIN
(solemn)
How did she die?

JOHN
She got really sick, Kevin. It was pretty
unexpected.
Kevin nods, understanding.

CONNIE
I'm sorry.

Kevin turns his head towards the hilltop, points his
flashlight. People are gathered there.

EXT. HILLTOP CLEARING -- NTGHT 93

John and Connie follow Ke: 1 to the summit that overlooks the
vast acreage of the Alancc  hemical plant.

ABOUT TWENTY PEOPLE: Kids, parents, teenagers, a few senior
citizens mill about amiably. Somewhere, a car radio plays.
There are no fires and no lights. John, Connie and Kevin
wander among them.

John sees Gordon Smallwood sitting alone on the hood of his
truck. They nod hello.

VOICE (0.S.)
Hey, look who’s here...

John turns. In the dark, it takes him a minute to recognize
Nat Griffin and his mother, Lucy.

LUCY
(shivering excitedly)
Getting cold, here, want some coffee?

She hands John and Connie Styrofoam cups.

NAT
In a week or so we'll have to watch from
our cars.

JOHN

Is it like this every Wednesday?

NAT
Naw, this is the most people so far.

CONNIE
Where'd Kevin go?

LUCY
He’s over there.

John and Connie wander off to the edge, looking out over the
chemical plant. They watch Kevin playing nearby.

CONNIE
Do you feel like talking about what
happened to your wife?

JOHN
Mary died last year on Christmas Eve. She
had a brain tumor. We didn’t know, but
there was a car accident one night and
they gave her an x-ray and found it. The

something, and she drew a picture of it.
It was a giant bird-man with wings and
red eyes.

CONNIE
Oh my God.

John turns to her and looks into her eyes:

JOHN
I'd pretty much forgotten that part of
things until you showed me that sketch...

DISSOLVE TO:
THE HILLTOP - AN HOUR LATER 94

The group has dwindled to to about ten people. John and
Connie sit on a blanket. Kevin is asleep at her side.

Nat Griffin points his VIDEO CAMERA to the sky, just above
the horizon:

NAT
Look, there they are!

Suddenly, excitement ripples through the remaining
spectators. John and Connie stand up. The camcorder lies
forgotten at John’s feet.

RED AND BLUE PINPOINTS OF LIGHT hover in the sky. Big deal.
It could be an airplane....

THE LIGHTS collapse in on each other and plummet straight
down into the river, disappearing at the horizon where the
water meets the sky.

More pairs of lights appear. Now some of them spin around
each other, and the after image looks like a DNA spiral
falling to the earth.

John watches spellbound as the flickering lights spin and
fall. The effect is hypnotic, eerie, dizzying,
disorienting...

JOHN
My God.

WIDE SHOT: John and Connie face the camera. In the
background, several other spectators look on.

John squints.

JOHN

Do you see it?

CONNIE
Yeah, I see something.

JOHN
What do you see?

CONNIE
I see spinning...

John unconsciously takes her hand...

JOHN
Me too. What colors?

CONNIE
Blue and red.

JOHN
How many lights?

CONNIE
Thirty, maybe more.

John and Connie stare up at the lights like kids at a magic
show. Then John realizes that he’s holding her hand. They
glance at each other and John lets go, embarrassed. John’s
eyes shift down to...

the red and blue lights reflecting off the water. But for
a moment, it almost seems as if the lights are coming from
the water -- and shining into the sky.

John steals a glance back at Connie -- she’s still looking at
him. And smiling.

EXT. ELECTRONICS STORE - DAY 96

Through a window decorated with Christmas lights, we see a
bank of TV MONITORS -- similar to the storefront we saw
earlier when John was on CNN.

INSIDE THE STORE: 97
John is shopping for an answering machine.

Suddenly, a hand lands on John’s shoulder. It’s Gordon
Smallwood -- and he looks scared:

GORDON
Mr. Klein -- I gotta talk to you...

John backs up, wary of the fear in Gordon's face.

GORDON (CONT'D)
(Confidential)
Last night I woke up with the worst
headache I’ve ever had in my life...So I
go to the bathroom to get some aspirin,

and I happen to look in the mirror -- and
I swear to God, I see something I can’t
describe -- but sure as hell know it’s

not my reflection.
John looks worried.

GORDON (CONT‘D)
Then it goes away. I can’t explain it,
but I just keep staring, telling this
thing...to show up again. But all I see
is me.

Gordon looks around nervously, making sure no one else can
hear this.

GORDON (cont‘d)
And then I hear this sound, like a weird
howl coming out of the sink. Then it’s a
voice...and it’s saying: “Do not be
afraid. Ninety-nine will die. Denver
Nine.” I even wrote it down...

Gordon pulls a wrinkled piece of paper from his shirt pocket
and fiddles with it.

GORDON (CONT’D)

It keeps saying the same thing, over and
over, for an hour. Then it stops.

Gordon peers at John, feeling sure John must think he’s lost
his mind -- but John encourages him to go on.

GORDON (CONT’D)
And when I look in the mirror, I can’t
see anything. Not even my own reflection.
(pauses)
Then this morning when I woke up, I
looked at the paper where I wrote down
the words, and this was on it.

He hands John the crumpled piece of paper. Beneath the words,
“Do not be afraid. Ninety-nine will die. Denver Nine” is a

sketch. It’s crude, but unmistakable: A_man with huge eyes
and wings.

JOHN
(pointing at sketch)
You don’t remember seeing this thing?

GORDON
No, and it scares the shit out of me.

John stares at the page, puzzled:
JOHN
Denver nine...Denver nine...Any idea what
that means?

Gordon shakes his head no. As they head out of the store,
John’s eyes narrow.

JOHN (cont’d)
Gordon...

John puts his hand on Gordon’s shoulder.

JOHN (cont’d)
Gordon, your ear's bleeding.

GORDON
What?

Gordon brings his hand to his ear. Blood is trickling along
his jaw from inside his ear. Gordon gazes down at his hand.

His stricken eyes dart to John.

DR. WILLIAMS sits with John, Gordon and Denise. Gordon is
pitched forward, a bundle of nerves, fearful. The doctor
points at:

A LUMINOUS CAT SCAN of a human brain.

DR. WILLIAMS
The CAT’S SCAN’s clean, Gordon, no sign
of any physical problem.

DENISE
Thank God.

GORDON
You’re sure? Because this man’s wife, she
had a brain tumor...

DENISE
(softly)
Gordon, please...

DR. WILLIAMS
What you had is a first class migraine. I
can write you a prescription.

DENISE
Thank you doctor, that would be very kind
of you --

JOHN

-- Dr. Williams, there are other
symptoms. He heard voices. There were
visual hallucinations. Those symptoms are
both associated with Glioblastoma
Multiforma.

DR. WILLIAMS

They are also associated with migraines.
There is nothing here to suggest
something as exotic as Glioblastoma
Multiforma.

(to Gordon)
If you'd like, I can refer you to another
neurologist for a second opinion, but --

Gordon shakes his head, confused and dismayed. He grabs
Denise and they all leave.

700 FOOT STEEL BRIDGE, an antique engineering marvei from the
1920s that spans the Ohio River.

INT/EXT. GORDON’S TRUCK/SILVER BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS 101

John watches Gordon and Denise: Gordon looks straight ahead,
one hand on the wheel, the other clutching Denise’s hand on
the seat between them. She’s putting up a good front, hiding
her concern. John lets his eyes drift down to the Ohio River
rushing beneath the bridge.

INT. COFFEE SHOP - NIGHT 102

Gordon, Denise and John sit together at a booth. Gordon looks
frightened.

DENISE
Hey -- it was good news, right? You're
not sick. That’s good.

GORDON
I wish I was sick, then I would know why
this is happening to me.

DENISE
Don’t say things like that, Gordon.

GORDON
I’m losing it. I’m hallucinating, hearing
voices, my ear’s bleeding.
(to John)
Was your wife hearing voices before her
tumor?

John doesn’t answer. His attention is riveted ACROSS THE
ROOM. John stands. He moves deliberately across the diner.

All the SOUND drains out of the room.

John crosses the COUNTER and slowly raises his hand in the
air. The blue glow of the Tv tints his fingertips as he TURNS
UP THE VOLUME.

horror. Gordon STANDS UP. His EYES LOCK with John’s.

NEWSMAN (0.S) (CONT'D)
There is no confirmation, but all ninety-
nine passengers and crew members are
believed dead.

JOHN’s face freezes, SHOCKED - this can’t be true! One look
at Gordon tells him that it is.

INT. JOHN'S MOTEL ROOM - EVENING 105

A phone cord stretches across a rumpled bedspread, shopping
bags, books, notes, photos and other research items.

- JOHN
{into phone)
May I speak to Albert Leek, please?

The voice that comes on the line is scratchy and distant.

LEEK (0.S.)
This is Leek.

JOHN
My name is John Klein and I’m working on
a pretty strange story, and I thought you
might be able to help me.

Silence on the line. John's hand rests on LEEK’S BOOK:
“THINGS UNSEEN”.

JOHN (CONT'D)
I've been reading your book, and I’m
especially interested in your theories
about prophecies --

Well, I’m sorry Mr. Klein I don’t work in

LEEK (0.S.)
The research didn’t prove viable.

What do you mean?

Click. Dial tone.

EXT. ALANCO CHEMICAL PLANT - AFTERNOON 106
Gordon hurries to his car in the plant’s parking lot, looking
awful. A FOREMAN stands in the background, looking at his
watch and narrowing his eyes.

INT. GORDON SMALLWOOD'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DUSK 107

Denise sits at the table, her face distraught. The sound of a
clock echoes through the quiet house.

JOHN (V.0)
Denise seems pretty worried about him.
You hear a voice, that’s one thing...

INT. CONNIE PARKER’S KITCHEN - NIGHT 108

Connie watches John pacing back and forth, holding Leek’s
book.

JOHN (CONT'D)

The way he describes them, they sound

CONNIE
I had a dream last night. It felt real to
me.

JOHN
Oh yeah?

Connie’s face darkens; just thinking about it scares her.
He can see she wants to tell him. He waits.

CONNIE
...It was nighttime, and I was in the
middle of the ocean, I was trying to
swim. But I was too cold. I looked for
something I could hold onto. There were
Christmas presents floating all around
me, wrapped up and tied with bows. I
tried to grab them but they kept popping
away. Like corks.

John listens intently as we...

Connie continues...

Honestly, I have absolutely no idea.

She snorts out a weak laugh. John smiles. John barely notices
Kevin standing at his knee.

KEVIN
(quietly)
You wanna play?

John looks at Connie: did Kevin hear all that? She shrugs,
then:

John follows Kevin into the den.

WE STAY ON CONNIE: She watches them getting along like John’s
been around forever. A lot of strange things have turned up
in Point Pleasant recently. On Connie’s face, we can see that
not all of them are bad...

EXT. POINT PLEASANT CHURCH - NEXT DAY 111

The service is letting out, and CHURCHGOERS head down the
front steps. Among them are Connie -- and John. He looks like
he hasn’t been in a church in years. As they move away from
the others, they notice DENISE standing nervously at the
bottom of the steps.

CONNIE
Denise?

DENISE
I don’t mean to bother you, Connie, but
it’s Gordon.

As she steps closer to Connie, she can see that Denise has
been crying.

CONNIE
Are you okay?

Denise avoids her eyes, carefully phrasing her next remark:

DENISE
I don‘t understand what’s happening to
him. If word gets out that Gordon’s, you
know, “hearing voices”...I need someone
to go talk to him.

GORDON

You met him?

John is stunned -- but completely hooked:
GORDON
Yeah. Last night, just about midnight. I

unfinished highway...

this bright flash of lightning...

A HORIZONTAL SPIRAL OF LIGHTNING crosses in front of his
truck.

Gordon pulls off the road.
EXT. UNFINISHED HWY - GORDON’S TRUCK - STOPPED 114

Gordon peers out through the passenger window, facing the
CAMERA .

BEHIND GORDON, we see AN OMINOUS VAGUE FIGURE approach the
driver side window from across the road. It has the general
characteristics of a MAN.

THE FIGURE taps on the glass.

GORDON spins around, gasps.

THE MAN stares at Gordon. We can barely see the outline of a
face.

John searches Gordon's face for a sign -- could this possibly

JOHN
Gordon, do you really believe this? You
realize how all this sounds?

Gordon gives him a “be patient” gesture, then smiles
triumphantly and holds up the morning newspaper: EARTHQUAKE
IN ECUADOR. 320 PEOPLE KILLED.

Gordon seems possessed of complete self-assurance. And this
scares John most of all.

INT. JOHN'S MOTEL ROOM - TWO NIGHTS LATER 118

Since we last saw it, the tiny motel room has been
transformed into...

JOHN’S INVESTIGATION HEADQUARTERS: A computer and fax machine
crowd the small desk. Newspapers, books and faxes are stacked
everywhere.

Maps cover the walls, studded with colored tacks: Red ones
for odd light events, blue ones for giant bird-creature
sightings, etc. In the middle of the chaos:

JOHN AND CONNIE sit on the bed, sharing a pizza and a bottle
of Merlot, watching:

NAT'S VIDEO (HILLTOP CLEARING - NIGHT) - INTERCUT 119

A weak, grainy, image of the sky over the river and the
chemical plant.

They study the TV. John draws his finger across the screen.
No trace of the lights.

JOHN
The lights should be right over here...
CONNIE
It’s probably just too dark to record.
JOHN
I wonder.

You ready for Josh's latest phone call?

John lifts a cassette player and hits “play.” On the tape we
hear Josh’s VOICE as he answers his phone:

On the other end of the line we hear an ungodly racket: a

Connie shakes her head in wonder:

CONNIE
This is definitely the weirdest date I’ve
ever been on.

JOHN
Is this a date?

CONNIE
Cut me some slack. It’s after eleven on a
weeknight and I’m in a motel room with a
single man. I’m calling it a date.

John gives her a curious smile, slightly lowering the volume
on the shrieking wail.

JOHN
I think it actually sounds sort of
beautiful, if you play it low. Kind of
like a mating call.

CONNIE
Yeah, I see what you mean, maybe this
could be our song?

John smiles. An awkward silence. He leans in and gently
kisses her. She kisses him back.

They pull back, both a little surprised at what’s just
happened. John's face makes it clear -- this is the first
woman he’s kissed since Mary died.

Connie breaks the awkward silence:

CONNIE (cont’d)
Look, if this is too soon, we could --

But before she can even finish,

THE PHONE RINGS. John is relieved to answer. It’s Gordon, and
he sounds stressed:

GORDON (0.S.)

Mr. Cold. He’s here. Right now. He’s

John turns away from Connie and sits on the edge of the bed.
The mood in the room has completely shifted:

JOHN
Let me talk to him.

GORDON (0.S.)
Sure. Hang on.

Then he turns to Connie and covers the mouthpiece:
JOHN
Get over to Gordon's quick, he says
Indrid Cold is there.

Connie doesn’t ask questions, she just grabs her things and
heads for the door.

A thin, monotone VOICE -- supposedly that of Indrid Cold --
comes on the line:

VOICE (0.S.)
Hello John Klein.

John tries to collect his thoughts.

JOHN
Who is this?

VOICE (0.S.)
My name is Indrid Cold.

John quickly attaches his tape recorder -- an expensive

Smallwood.

INDRID COLD (0.S.)
Your father was born in Racine,
Wisconsin. You lived in a green house on
Monroe street. You can’t remember how
your mother looked.

John realizes he’s sweating, his breathing has quickened. He
makes himself breathe normally.

JOHN
Okay, you’ve got my attention. What color
shirt am I wearing?

INDRID COLD(O.S.)
Red shirt, three buttons.

Correct. Hmm. John looks around the room. The curtains are
open. He pulls them shut. He looks down and sees his watch in
his shoe.

JOHN
Where’s my watch?

INDRID COLD(O.S.)
Shoe under bed.

He looks around the room: Hidden cameras? An elaborate trick?
He shuts off all the lights. Then plunges his hand into his
overnight bag.

JOHN
What am I holding in my hand?

INDRID COLD(O.S.)
Cream stick.

John pulls his hand from his bag: he holds a small tube of
Chapstick. Suddenly, an explanation occurs.

JOHN

Indrid Cold -- are you reading my mind?

INDRID COLD(O.S.)
I have no need to.

INDRID COLD(O.S.)
(instantly)
‘“-- Face unadorned held a naked promise
that her figure did --”

John flips on the lamp, opens the book, finds the page, scans
the line, takes a sharp breath. Correct.

INDRID COLD(O.S.)

Still more proof John Klein?

Connie’s speeding Prowler hugs the curves of a winding back
road, blue and red gumballs flashing.

John is still on the phone with Indrid Cold. His mood has
shifted from skepticism to anxious fascination:

JOHN
What do you look like?

INDRID COLD(O.S.)
Variable.

JOHN
I want to meet you.

INDRID COLD(O.S.)
We already have. You frighten easily.
You‘re afraid right now.
JOHN
You seem to know a lot. Can you tell me
something...What happened to my wife?
A long silence. The silence makes John nervous.

The one who was Mary Klein cannot be
found by looking.

Contact is possible. See you in time.

The line ERUPTS IN A HIGH PITCHED WHINE, a metallic WHISTLE,
piercing John’s ear. He flings the phone away. The receiver
keeps SCREECHING on the floor. John stares at the phone. The
SCREECH becomes a terrible CREAK, replaced by STATIC, then
nothing, finally a dial tone. John forces himself to retrieve
the receiver and place it back on the cradle. Sweat beads
roll down into his eyes.

EXT. GORDON SMALLWOOD’S HOUSE - NIGHT 122

Connie’s hand pounds on the door. Nothing. She pounds again.
Nothing. Finally, a light goes on inside and...

GORDON SMALLWOOD opens the door slowly. He’s in boxer shorts,
hair-mussed, fresh from bed. He squints out at Connie:

GORDON
What's up, Connie? Everything okay?

CONNIE

cycles per second. The lowest it gets is
maybe, 1930 or so...

Then John's VOICE comes on the tape.

SONNY (cont'd)
Yours is way down here in normal vocal
range: anywhere from 1000 to 1200 cycles
per second.

JOHN
So this guy’s vocal range is higher than
mine?
SONNY

You‘re bullshitting me, right? How’d you

JOHN
Do what?
SONNY

Create the voice. It’s a good mimic, but

Groundhogs don’t go that high.

JOHN
So what the hell is it?

As the tape plays, Sonny isolates Indrid Cold’s voice and

John's car passes through a tollbooth, exiting the main
highway. There’s something eerie about it, but John is
wrapped up in his call and doesn't notice.

A cold wind howls outside. John lies in bed, tossing and
turning in the dark...

LATER 128

Now the lights are on. He sits on the edge of the bed,
CHANNEL SURFING.

He clicks off the TV and throws down the remote...

MOMENTS LATER 129
Now he's dressed. He grabs his keys and he’s out the door.

EXT. GORDON SMALLWOOD'S HOUSE - NIGHT 130

John stands on the Porch talking to Denise. She shakes her
head, points towards town.
INT/EXT. JOHN’S CAR - PARKING AREA/HILLTOP CLEARING - NIGHT 131

John's car rolls to a stop at the hilltop near the Alanco
Chemical Plant. No other cars parked, no sign of Gordon.

John spots Gordon mid-span, leaning over the railing,

Gordon doesn’t seem to hear him.

John reaches Gordon’s side, places his hand on his shoulder.

Gordon stares out at nothing in particular.

GORDON
(calmly)
I used to walk up here when I was a
little kid. We’re right between West
Virginia and Ohio. So technically, I
figure we're not in either one...

JOHN
Come on Gordon it’s freezing out here,
you want to warm up in my car?

Gordon slowly shakes his head.

GORDON
Can’t. I’m waiting for him.

John nods, waits for him to continue:

GORDON (CONT’D)
John, everybody in this town is looking
at me like I’m insane...You know why?

John goes to answer, but Gordon continues:

It’s because I’m telling the

John stares at Gordon, incredulous: Gordon looks as sure of
himself and resolute as when they first met. John takes a
moment to gather his thoughts.

JOHN
I have an idea, but before I tell you
what it is, I want you to know I don’t
think you‘re crazy. Okay?

GORDON
(calmly)
I’m not crazy.

JOHN
I’ve heard about a program at the
University. They work with people who’ve
had strange experiences, and try to
figure out if these events are
occurring...outwardly or inwardly. You
see what I mean?

GORDON
You think I’m imagining all this?

JOHN
I don’t know, Gordon.

EXT. ROAD/UNFINISHED HIGHWAY - NIGHT 135
John drives past the scrap yard next to the UNFINISHED

HIGHWAY where Gordon claims to have met Indrid Cold. As JOHN
drives under the elevated RAMP TO NOWHERE...

INT - CAR - NIGHT (INTERCUT) 136
..-his face suddenly contorts with fear.

He looks around terrified: what’s happening to him?

Sweat beads on his forehead, he tries to move his arms, his
hands, his legs -- he’s paralyzed with fear.

The car continues to roll forward, increasing speed. Ten
Feet...Twenty...Thirty! His fear escalates into panic. Every
yard an eternity of unbearable terror. At fifty feet, he
crosses an_ invisible border: his fear leaves as suddenly as
it came.

John stops the car. He catches his breath, gathering his
nerve to investigate further.

EXT. UNFINISHED HIGHWAY/SCRAP YARD - CONTINUOUS 137

ohn climbs ovt of his car, plants his feet on the aspha?t,
looks around.

Nothing out of the ordinary. No sign of Indrid Cold or any
other explanation -- what did he just pass through?

He walks back towards the area, slowly, cautiously, trying to
stay calm.

Then he takes one step too many.

He’s back inside the zone. The air becomes perfectly still as
ALL AUDIBLE SOUNDS -- animals, birds, even insects -- are
sucked into silence. The night becomes darker, too dark.

John's breathing becomes shallow and fast. He falls to the
ground, engulfed in fear.

JOHN(V.O.)
I couldn't move. I don’t know what it
was, I was more afraid than I’ve ever
been in my whole life. I was just a few
feet from where I came in, but it felt
like I'd never make it back...

INT. CONNIE’S PROWL CAR - DAY 138

Connie listens intently to John as she drives towards the
unfinished highway.

JOHN (V.0O.)
...I’m on my knees, and I’m
hyperventilating. I couldn’t stand up. It
took me a half hour to crawl the five
feet out of there.
John looks at Connie. She doesn’t know what to say.

JOHN (CONT'D)
This is it, up ahead.

EXT. UNFINISHED HIGHWAY - DAY 139

Connie slows the Prowler to a crawl, then brakes. They get
out.

CONNIE

John and Connie walk slowly. John tries to get his bearings.

He starts to walk. Connie joins him and they step over an
imaginary line together. They look at each other. She shakes
her head. Nothing.

JOHN (cont'd)
Let‘s keep going.

They walk further. Nothing. John stops, perplexed, shakes his
head.

JOHN (cont'd)
(quietly)
I swear, it was right here.

Connie looks at him. She doesn’t feel it. But last night,
John did. Connie looks into his eyes, sees a man shaken from
an experience he can't explain. She takes his hand in hers.

HIGH ANGLE

They walk back and forth, back and forth, back and forth.

Birds chirp, the winter sun is shining brightly, and we pull
back on two people searching for an imaginary circle.

INT. INTERVIEW CUBICLES - UNIVERSITY - DAY 140
We INTERCUT between John and Gordon -- as each is interviewed

by DR. LEE OKSTER, (37), friendly, and way too good looking
to be in a lab coat:

OKSTER
As a child, were you prone to seizures?
JOHN
No.
OKSTER
Were you often left at home alone?

Did you have a guardian angel or secret
friend?

Gordon looks up, as if waking from a dream, as we go...
INT. ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM LAB - LATER 1421

INTERCUT again between John and Gordon with small electric
patches taped to their faces and skulls. EEG printouts scroll
out beside them.

INT. LABORATORY RESEARCH CENTER - LATER 142
Dr. Okster shows John and Gordon their EEG printouts.

OKSTER
Alright, this line here? It measures
activity in the temporal lobe, the visual
and perceptual center of the brain.
Disorders in this area have been linked
to both alien encounters and near-death
experiences.

JOHN
Disorders like a brain tumor?

OKSTER
Maybe. But neither you nor Mr. Smallwood
seem to have any temporal lobe
abnormalities.

JOHN
So what does that leave?

OKSTER
You might have been exposed to an
electromagnetic field. Certain people are
more sensitive than others to these EM
waves, and it stimulates their temporal
lobes causing vivid hallucinations.

Gordon squints skeptically:

INT. JOHN KLEIN’ MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 143

CLOSE ON A BOOK PAGE -- A 15TH CENTURY DRAWING OF A GIANT MAN
WITH INSECT EYES AND WINGS. It looks like something from the
Ars Moriendi -- “The Art of Dying” -- Medieval Christian
texts on death.

CONNIE (0.S.)
“The Nocturnal Butterfly. Also called
Mothman. In ancient cultures, the moth
represents a form of the psyche, or the
soul immortally trapped in the hellish
death realms...”

Connie sits on the edge of a bed, wearing her uniform. She
reads from a MYTHOLOGY BOOK.

John’s weekender lies open on the other bed: he’s packing.
It‘s late. A cold wind howls outside.

CONNIE (CONT’D)
(reading)
--.“Mothman is one of the most obscure
and frightening mythological creatures of
the underworld...”

Connie closes the book. She’s read enough for tonight. She
tosses it on the floor. John stops packing and looks at her.

CONNIE (CONT’D)
(softly)
What time’s your flight?

JOHN
Eight AM.

Connie looks away, missing him already.
EXT. NEW YORK STREET - DAY 144

ON WEST 83RD STREET: John stands in a doorway across from the
brownstone Criterion Apartments. He sees...

A MAN emerges from the apartment building: stocky, red face
and crew-cut hair. Looks like a retired drill sergeant.

John glances at the author photo on the book he holds,
“Things Unseen”. Sure enough, it’s the same guy: ALBERT LEEK.
John dodges across the street and stops him.

JOHN
Mr. Leek...

Leek stops in his tracks, alarmed. John holds up one of the
Bird-Man sketches:

JOHN (cont'd)
- Do you know what this is?

Leek’s eyes flick from the sketch to John’s face:

LEEK
Who the hell are you?

JOHN
John Klein. I called you. I need to know
about this.
Leek stares at him, considers -- then pushes quickly past:

LEEK
I’m sorry but I’m already late.

John follows after him down the crowded street.

JOHN
Have you ever seen this thing?

Leek keeps walking, trying to ignore the man following him.
JOHN (cont'd)
(shouting over street noise)
I need your help, Mr. Leek?
Leek finally stops and turns -- John almost runs into him.

LEEK
Where are they seeing him?

JOHN
{out of breath)
Point Pleasant, West Virginia...
He stares at John, making up his mind: should he bother?

Leek grabs the sketch from John and gazes at it. He looks
like he’s staring at his own obituary.

Leek nods.

LEEK
Follow me.

INT. METROPOLIS BOOK SHOP - DAY 145

John follows Leek into the giant, dusty old bookstore.
Shelves tower overhead; stacks of books line the floor;
aisles roll out in all directions, disappearing into murky
darkness.

ANGLE ON AISLE: John watches Leek scan the titles, his head
tilted to the side. He plucks a book off the shelves:

LEEK
Ah, here we are...

Leek flips through a book and stops on A PAINTING OF A GIANT
MAN WITH WINGS. It looks like something out of Greek
mythology. John shudders.

JOHN
Mothman?

LEEK
That’s what the Ukrainians called him.
Rough translation, of course. There were
a hundred sightings in Chernobyl the year
the nuclear plant went down.

JOHN
Jesus.

Leek turns to A GRAINY PHOTOGRAPH, the kind we’ve all seen:
blurry, poorly framed -- but instead of a UFO, a Moth-like
figure hovers in the sky.

LEEK

hurricane. They saw it. But seeing isn’t

UFO's.

JOHN
What about Roswell?

LEEK
Come on. You work in Washington. Is that
braintrust capable of keeping that kind
of secret?

John rubs his eyes, confused:

JOHN
So you're saying these things don’t
exist?

LEEK

Sure they exist. There’s all kinds of
things that exist all around us that we
never see, right? Electricity,
microwaves, infra-red waves. You know,
they’ve been around forever, they show up
in cave paintings. They’re a normal
condition of the planet, they're just not
part of our consensus of what constitutes
physical reality.

JOHN
(frustrated)
But what are they?

LEEK
Look, you're asking for an explanation
for something that can’t be explained
rationally.

JOHN
But why do they show-up before all these
disasters?

Leek re-shelves the book, turns to John:

LEEK
You know all that build-up of energy
before something happens? The way your
hair stands up before lightning strikes?
That's when they cross over --

JOHN

-- What do you mean, before something
happens? Do they cause disasters?

LEEK
Why would they need to? No, my theory is
they foreshadow death and disaster.

John lets that sink in, then:

JOHN
What do they want?
LEEK
I have no idea. What you really want to
know is why you.
JOHN
Okay. Yeah.
LEEK

You think you're special. Trust me,
you're not. You just got in their way.

JOHN
Got in their way?

LEEK
You noticed them. And they noticed that
you noticed them. Most people aren’t
sensitive enough to see them without some
sort of trauma.

John winces. Leek studies him, leans in.

LEEK (cont ‘d)
Are you fixated on death, Mr. Klein?

John is silent. Leek nods knowingly, then walks down the
aisle and out the door. John follows.

EXT. NEW YORK STREET - DUSK 146

Loud, crowded, and cold. John and Leek walk into the wind:

JOHN :
Last week my friend got a strange phone
call from a spirit or entity or whatever.

It seemed to know... everything. Like
God.

And *t made predictions, and they came
true...

JOHN
(nods, excited)
Yeah. He called himself Indrid Cold.

John searches Leek’s face for a sign of recognition; Leek
just shrugs. The name means nothing to him.

LEEK
If your “friend” thinks he’s talking to
God, he’s off by more than a few degrees.

JOHN
But how could he know all this stuff?

Leek stops walking. He looks around, trying to figure out a
way to explain.

LEEK
Look up there...

John looks where Leek is pointing...

A SKYSCRAPER: Ten stories up, a window-washer squeegees the
side of a glass building.

LEEK (CONT'D)
If there was a car crash on Eighty Fourth
and Riverside that window washer up there
could probably see it. Doesn’t mean he’s
God -- or even any smarter than we are.
But from where he’s sitting, he can see a
little further down the road.

JOHN
But they’ve gotta be more advanced then
us. Why don’t they just come right out
and say what’s on their minds?

Leek nods.
LEEK
You're more advanced than.a cockroach --
ever try explaining yourself to one?

They continue down the street, each lost in their own
thoughts. John breaks the silence:

JOHN
So, what about Point Pleasant?

LEEK
How many people have seen it?

LEEK
Don’t go back there,
Mr. Klein.

JOHN
What?

LEEK
Listen to me, something terrible is going
to happen in Point Pleasant.

John is struck by the sudden fear that has clouded Leek’s
face.

LEEK (cont’d)
Nothing you do can stop it. Don’t go
back, stay away, and stay away from
me...I can’t talk about this any more.

Leek starts to walk away, but John’s desperation demands an
answer. He pulls Leek violently by the arm.

JOHN
Look, Mr. Leek, there’s got to be a

reason I ended up in Point Pleasant...
something brought me there.

Leek pulls away.
LEEK
If it brought you there, it brought you
there to die.
LEEK disappears down a dark staircase to the subway.

John has put off his flight and spends hours walking circles

Leek’s face darkens, clouded by a bad memory. He lets the
door swing open.

John follows him down a long hallway into the KITCHEN.

John nods.

JOHN

No.
LEEK

Once they get to you, it’s hard to sleep,

LEEK (cont’d)
You cross a line between what’s real and

Leek pours himself a cup of tea and sits down at a table
across from John.

LEEK (cont’d)
I was a physics professor at Cornell,
tenured, you can look me up. One day I
started hearing voices. The voices became
messages. Before long, I was fully
convinced that I was receiving
predictions of disaster from “outside
intelligences.”

LEEK
People died.

Leek finishes his tea and goes into the LIVING ROOM, John
follows.

LEEK (cont'd)
I was investigated and almost arrested.
My wife divorced me and my kids stopped
speaking to me. I spent four horrific
years in a psychiatric facility. I lost
everything.

JOHN
Oh my god.

Leek has moved over to a mantle in front of a fireplace.
Pictures of his past life loom behind him.

LEEK
Being right is worse than being wrong. If
you're wrong, you’re just a fool, if
you‘re right, you’re a suspect.
Basically, it’s a lose lose situation.

Leek walks towards John, stands very close to him. John looks
lost and exhausted.

LEEK (cont‘d)
They fuck with guys like us, Mr. Klein.
You’1l never understand their messages.
You'll misinterpret them...I did. It
almost destroyed me...
You know what? In the end it all came

EXT. TOWN SQUARE - NIGHT 151

About a hundred townsfolk have gathered for the annual
Christmas tree lighting. John searches for Connie. He winds
his way through the crowd, past Nat and Lucy, C.J. and Holly,
Josh and the cranky Night Manager. Everyone seems a bit
anxious: there’s trouble getting the tree lit.

He spots Connie and Denise standing in a storefront, sharing
a cigarette. They both look upset. John hugs Connie, but she
doesn’t hug him back. John is hurt. Denise smooths the
awkward moment:

_ DENISE

You’re just in time, they’re about to
light the tree -- have been for the last
two hours.

JOHN
Really?
(surveying the crowd)
Where’s Gordon? Didn’t he come?

Denise points. Gordon is standing off by himself. He looks
broken, preoccupied, tense.

John notices that Connie has wandered off. He catches up with
her, gently takes her arm.

JOHN (CONT’D)
What's wrong?

CONNIE

Nothing.

Are you okay?
Connie looks too upset to talk.

CONNIE

Well, Gordon got himself fired from the
chemical plant.

JOHN
That's terrible.

CONNIE

Just kept talking about Indrid Cold,
wouldn’t shut up. Fifteen more people
reported seeing the “The Mothman” today.
Fifteen.

And three of them were cops. I hate this,
John. I absolutely goddamn hate this.

Kevin wanders up to them, tugs at his Mom's coat. John looks
down: One of Kevin's eves is swollen shut -- just like C.J.

John masks his frightened reaction.

JOHN
Hi Kevin.

KEVIN
(somberly)
Hi John. Mom, can I go closer to the
elves?

CONNIE
Stay where I can see you.

Kevin shuffles away.

John walks over to Kevin for a private talk. Kevin seems more
subdued than usual.

JOHN (CONT’D)
How are you doing, pal?

KEVIN

Okay, I guess.

JOHN
What happened to your eye?

Kevin won’t answer. John reaches for Kevin's hands: he’s
trembling. John warms them in his, rubbing them together.
Kevin stares at John.

KEVIN
Is my mom going to die?

John is taken aback, but he recovers:

JOHN
Of course not. Why?

John looks tenderly at Kevin, but the conviction in his voice
is undeniable:

JOHN (CONT'D)
Nothing is going to happen to your mom,
okay?
Kevin looks at him; he wants to believe it, but...

Connie stops, looks him in the eyes.
JOHN (cont'd)
These things are real. Indrid Cold is

tell me something...I don’t know what.

John waits for her to react. All he sees on her face is
concern. Whatever she’s thinking, she doesn’t want to say it.

Fifty feet above them, the grand old pine tree lights. They
stare, speechless. It’s beautiful, but at the same time,

maybe because of the events of the last months, a pall hangs
over the town...

John climbs out of bed. The phone starts ringing. He ignores
it. He goes to the window and draws back the curtains...

A BRIGHT ORANGE MOON (INTERCUT) 154

glows on the horizon. Silhouetted against it: a leafless
tree, bending in the wind.

The tree turns toward John. Glowing red eyes shine at him.
How could he have missed it? It’s not a tree at all.

GORDON (0.S.)
John? It’s Gordon.

Gordon's VOICE is distant and staticky.

JOHN
Gordon? Where are you, I can barely hear -

GORDON (0.S.)
(excited)
-- Jeez, I can’t believe I got
through...Listen, John: he was right.
Mr.Cold was right about everything.

John strains to hear; he shouts into the bad connection:

JOHN
Right about what?

GORDON (O.S.)
It’s beautiful, John. I want you to know
that. It truly is. You've got nothing to
worry about.

JOHN
What‘s beautiful, Gordon? What are you
talking about?
Gordon's VOICE grows fainter.
GORDON (0.S.)S
I gotta go. Goodbye, John. Thanks for
everything. I'll see you in time.

A huge flare of static and then silence. No dial tone, no
click...Just silence.

John RUSHES toward the barn as Connie emerges with Denise,
who’s crying hysterically.

John is stopped short: Denise gle es at him with hatred in
her eyes:

DENISE
(under her breath)
It’s your fault...you encouraged him...

Denise climbs the porch and disappears into the house. Connie
takes John’s arm as they walk back towards the barn.

CONNIE
You know she doesn’t mean it.

John nods.

JOHN
Did she see it?

CONNIE
No, she was asleep when she heard the
shot. Gordon wasn’t in bed. She came out
here and found him in back with his

shotgun.

JOHN
Jesus...Do you know what time it
happened?

Connie wipes her eyes and checks her notebook:

CONNIE
Around 4 A.M.

John flinches, like he’s just been struck.
CONNIE (cont'd)

I can’t stand this, John. I feel like

everyone in town is losing their mind.
John knows exactly what she means.
INT. IRON HORSE TAVERN - LATE AFTERNOON 157
John is wearing a black suit, hunched over a glass of scotch.
A couple people dressed in mourning clothes are gathered at

I got your message yesterday, I meant to

I don’t talk like that. No one does.

EXT. STREET - POINT PLEASANT - DUSK 159

It’s just getting dark as John pulls into town, parks in
front of the POLICE STATION.

John bounds up the station steps, his mind still reeling from
the events at the sound lab. He stops abruptly and walks back
down the steps, turns left.

A WOMAN WITH RED HAIR climbs the steps from the right. John
just misses seeing her, but we do: she’s a dead-ringer for
Mary.

We follow John to a -

EXT. STREET/CORNER SHOP - POINT PLEASANT - DAY 160

John climbs the steps. As he passes through the glass front

Once again, John misses seeing her. Is that Mary? Now we're
not sure. Something looks different.

Connie follows him...

OUTSIDE THE POLICE STATION: John heads across the street to
the town square, turning around as he walks, his eyes
everywhere, scanning in all directions:

JOHN
What did she say?

Connie struggles to keep up with him:

CONNIE
All these strange questions: What are you
writing about? Do you believe in
Prophecy? What would your reaction be if
I asked you to stop investigating Indrid
Cold -- if I said it was for your own
good?

JOHN
What did you say?

CONNIE

I asked for some I.D. -- will you slow
down please?

164 CONTINUED: 164

JOHN
Did she give you any?

CONNIE
No. She just said, “Tell John I’m sorry
for ruining everything.” And then she got
up and walked out.

John stops in his tracks and whips around, staring at Connie.

CONNIE (CONT'D)
What's wrong?

For a moment John can't speak. Then he claws his wallet out
of his coat, flips it open and thrusts it at Connie:

JOHN
Was it her?

Connie focuses on a wallet-size snapshot of Mary Klein -- and
her eyes go wide in shock: This is the woman.

JOHN (CONT'D)
Was it her?

CONNIE
(barely audible)
That's your wife?
JOHN
(on fire)
It was her.
Connie slowly shakes her head. This is impossible...

And just that fast, doubt forms in her eyes.

CONNIE
I’m not sure.
JOHN
What?
CONNIE
I mean -- the hair is different, and...

John stares at her in disbelief: she’s convincing herself
that it wasn’t Mary she saw.

Oh, come on.

The crazed look on John’s face scares the hell out of her.
There’s no way she’s buying into all this.

CONNIE
No it isn’t, John. I agree, there is
a...a similarity, maybe, but --

JOHN
Bullshit!

This hits Connie like a slap in the face. She struggles to
maintain her calm.

CONNIE
John -- tell me you’re okay.
JOHN
I’m not okay. You saw her. You know you
did.
(pleading)
Don’t do this to me. Not you.
CONNIE
Please John -- tell me you're okay.

John shakes his head; he’s never felt more alone in his life.

JOHN
I gotta go.

John storms off, leaving Connie standing in the middle of the
town square.

John enters. The PHONE RINGS. He looks at ti >» answering
machine: the number ‘9’ flashes insistently.

John slowly approaches the phone and picks it up...

AN EAR-SHATTERING BEEP -- he slams the receiver down.

John hits the “playback” on his answering machine. It rewinds
and plays: More BEEPING...Odd electronic MUSIC...A strange,
high-pitched rhythmic MURMUR...

What the hell does all this mean?

The PHONE RINGS. He hesitates, then picks it up. It’s a high-
pitched CHORUS OF VOICES.

VOICES (V.0.)
Are you John Klein?

JOHN
Yes.

VOICES (V.0O.)
Mr. Klein...

And now the VOICES slow down and deepen:

VOICE (V.O.)
Sorry...I...ruined... everything...

John slams down the phone. He's shaking now, in a full sweat.
But now he has an idea...

He removes the tape from the answering machine and inserts it
into his PORTABLE MINI-RECORDER.

He cues the tape to the HIGH-PITCHED RHYTHMIC MURMUR message,
then plays it through three or four times, listening closely
for words, voices -- anything.

Nothing. Just the odd murmuring noise.

The PHONE RINGS. John lets it ring, waiting for the machine
to pick up -- then realizes he’s removed the tape. Damn. He
really doesn’t want to answer the phone...

But he has to.

He reaches for it, his hand literally shaking. He picks it

John drives like a bat out of hell, gripping the wheel

Still forging ahead aimlessly into the night. John fights
exhaustion and paranoia. Another sign whizzes past: “You are

John’s eyes snap open. The woman laughs, incredulous:

WOMAN (cont’d)

She pulls out a thick stack of pink message slips.

This can’t be happening. John takes the stack of messages,

They all say the same thing: “Call me. Urgent. Mary Klein.”

INT. JOHN'S MOTEL ROOM - POINT PLEASANT - NIGHT 173
It’s still dark out. John enters like he’s walking into a
snake pit. He quickly knocks the phone off the hook before it

has a chance to ring. He looks around the room...

JOHN'S POV: Mothman drawings, photos, maps, charts, books --
it looks like a lunatic’s office.

John comes to a decision: there’s only one thing to do.

John opens a box of 40-gallon trash bags. He shakes one open
and slowly begins stuffing it.

He starts with the photos, next go the note cards. Then the
maps and charts. He begins moving faster and faster.

He furiously jams faxes and articles into the bag. Finally,
he rips THE MOTHMAN DRAWINGS off the wall and tears them up.

EXT. MOTEL - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS) 174

John throws a huge armload of trash in a dumpster behind the
motel.

INT. JOHN'S MOTEL ROOM -NIGHT 175

Riding the momentum, picking up steam, John storms through
the room, dismantling the headquarters with glee.

Suddenly, a POLAROID PICTURE falis from the wall onto the
desk in front of him. He freezes -- then relaxes: it’s the
one of him and Mary in Hawaii. He smiles.

Finally, it seems like it might be okay. He stares at this
island of normalcy in a room packed with madness.

shoulde:, we see something in the sky that has never been in
the picture before...

A tiny, bird-like figure with two red, glowing eyes.

John sinks’to the floor, gripping the picture. Even here --
in his memories -- he isn’t safe.

JOHN

No, no, no...

John sits in the dark room clutching his portable mini-
recorder and playing the HIGH-PITCHED MURMUR over and over...

INT. JOHN'S MOTEL ROOM - MORNING 177
John hasn’t moved. Dawn is breaking. John sits, half-asleep,
the recorder still playing in his hands. But the batteries

are dying and the tape plays slowly, the hi-pitched murmur

now sounding like...a voice?

THE PHONE RINGS.

Startled, John jolts awake and grabs the receiver:

JOHN
What?

It’s Cyrus Bills, John’s editor from the Post:

CYRUS (0.S.)
It's me, Cyrus...

John tries to clear his head -- what is that weird noise? He
realizes his mini-recorder is still playing...

CYRUS (0.S.) (cont'd)

catch you...John! You there?

JOHN
Yeah, yeah, what?

CYRUS (0.S.)
This is important. Governor McCallum is
touring the Alanco Chemical Plant today,
right there where you are. I need you
there. Are you listening?

JOHN
McCallum, at the chemical plant. Got it.

But John’s attention is now riveted to his tape player: as
the batteries continue to run down, the sound of a VOICE
becomes even clearer...

John holds the recorder to his free ear, straining to hear.

CYRUS (0.S.)
I need to know you're going to be
there...

John pays no attention, the VOICE becomes clearer every
second...

CYRUS (O.S.) (cont'd)
John?...

John sets the receiver down on the ground, forgetting about

it completely, and turns the volume of the mini-recorder all
the way up to “10”.

The VOICE on the tape -- now a low-pitched drone -- is
perfectly clear and very familiar: It is Indrid Cold.
INDRID COLD (V.0.)
{on tape)
Great tragedy on River-Ohio. Great

tragedy on River-Ohio. Great tragedy on
River-Ohio...

We hear Cyrus shouting to John through the discarded phone
receiver, but John listens to the tape, transfixed.

Think about it: the weird lights in the
sky show up over the chemical plant. Josh
got a call from me -- which wasn’t from
me ~- where I talked about somethin~ bad
happening at the chemical plant. Th - I
got a call from Indrid Cold talking isout
a tragedy on the Ohio River, and guess
what's on the Ohio River?

CONNIE
The chemical plant.

JOHN
And today Governor McCallum is going to
be there. I was on my way to interview
him last week when I ended up here in the
first place. All the pieces fit -- it
explains everything!

Connie stops getting ready and turns to him:

CONNIE
What about Josh's phone calls? Or Holly’s
burns? How does all that fit in?

JOHN
I don’t know exactly. It must all be part
of the warning.

CONNIE
(incredulous)
What?

JOHN
How many sightings of Mothman have you
logged down at the station?

CONNIE
(distracted)
I don’t know...thirty, forty...

leave town. Now.

Connie turns to him, angry and scared:

off the security detail. I don’t want you

my fault. I tried to help him, but he
wouldn't listen to me! I’m not going to
let the same thing happen to you!

Connie stares at him. The look on her face makes John take
his hands off her.

Connie turns, grabs her gun and purse, doesn’t even look at

John falls in smoothly, steers through the aides with the
magic words, “Washington Post”, and moves up alongside the
Governor.

JOHN
Good afternoon, Governor.

ROB MCCALLUM
Hi, John. I missed you in Richmond.

JOHN
I need to speak with you, it’s urgent.

John's intensity registers. McCallum’s smile wrinkles into
concern. He lowers his voice.

ROB MCCALLUM
What’s this about, John?

JOHN
It's the tour. You can’t do it, you can’t
go. The plant’s at risk.
An AIDE is close enough to overhear.
AIDE
(in a murmur)
-- ah, shit.
McCallum’s pace falters.
JOHN
You need to get the place shut down for a
safety inspection.
AIDE
They‘ve done two checks already,
Governor.
McCallum nods at the aide. John fights down his desperation.

McCallum has enough sense to keep his voice low.

AIDE

JOHN
I never said it was a bomb -- it’s

something...You have to believe me.

And right that minute, with his messy hair and his circled
eyes, he’s no longer believable. McCallum’s gaze settles on
him. The aide’s voice is stronger.

AIDE

security check. We’re ready to roll,

McCallum and the Aide exchange concerned glances.

If it’s about today --

JOHN
-- No, no, I just got a message...

John holds up THE NOTE.

JOHN (cont’d)
I have to get back to my apartment in
Georgetown.

Connie notices something odd about John: he doesn’t seem
upset at all. In fact, he looks more confident than ever.

JOHN (cont'd)
Indrid Cold says I’1l be contacted on
Friday at noon.

Connie can’t believe what she’s hearing. She watches as John
moves about the room with robot-like intensity.

CONNIE |
Do you have any idea what's happened to
you, John? What you’ve allowed to happen?
JOHN

I didn’t allow anything.

He tries to hand her the NOTE; she pushes it away, won’t even
look at it. CAMERA slowly moves in on the note...we see that

nothing is written on it

CONNIE
(desperate)
Don't leave. For God's sake, stop
following his orders!

JOHN
I know you won’t be able to understand
this, but I can’t.

Connie stands in front of him, talking as slow and deliberate
as a hostage negotiator.

CONNIE
Please John. Don’t do this.

John doesn’t even look at her as he steps around her, grabs
his bags and leaves.

John staggers in and drops his bags. He flops onto his bed
fully dressed, not even removing his overcoat...

EXT. POINT PLEASANT TOWN SQUARE ~ DAY 189
Snow falls on the glowing Christmas Tree...
INT. POINT PLEASANT ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - DAY 190

We now SEE the SINGING CHOIR -- a group of SCHOOL CHILDREN on
stage. Right in front, Kevin Parker.

IN THE AUDIENCE: Connie listens, smiling and crying...
EXT. FIRE STATION 51 - POINT PLEASANT - DAY 191

Josh Jessup and the other fireman use the truck ladders to
place Christmas lights along the station house roof...

EXT. LUCY GRIFFIN’S HOUSE - BACKYARD - SUNSET 192
Lucy and Nat Griffin build a giant snowman with GIANT WINGS
AND INSECT EYES beneath the blue pine tree where Mothman
appeared just weeks ago...

INT. JOHN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 193

John -- still in his clothes and overcoat from yesterday --
sits in complete darkness, staring at his phone...

INT. CONNIE PARKER'S HOUSE - NIGHT 194

Connie and Kevin decorate their Christmas tree. Connie stops
to gaze out the window; a gentle snow is falling...

INT. JOHN’S APARTMENT - WASHINGTON D.C. - NIGHT 195

John stares out the window of his apartment. Snow falls here,
too; but it falls hard and wet and gray...

candlelight flickers against the walls. She bows her head in
prayer, tears streaming down her cheeks...

The CHOIR (0.S.) brings their song to its final, poignant
notes...

INT. JOHN’S APARTMENT - NIGHT 198

John is curled asleep on the cold dark living room floor...
FADE OUT.

INT. JOHN'S APARTMENT - NEXT MORNING - DAY 199

John looks like hell: he hasn’t shaved or changed clothes in
three days. He gazes at the clock -- it’s almost noon.

He clutches the Polaroid -- Mothman still clearly visible in
the sky -- and waits. As John stares at the Polaroid, the
Mothman’s eyes seem to stare back at him.

IMPOSSIBLE ANGLE on John’s face from the Mothman’s POV in the
photo.

THE PHONE RINGS. John pounces:

JOHN

Hello?

CONNIE - AT HOME (INTERCUT CONVERSATION) 200

CONNIE

Hi. It’s me.
JOHN

Connie?
CONNIE

Yeah. Just thought we could chat for,
say, ten or fifteen minutes...

(beat)
You're not laughing.

JOHN
I'm sorry, Connie. Can I call you back?

CONNIE
No, you can’t. I booked you a flight.

What?

CONNIE
It leaves Dulles for Columbus, Ohio at

Charleston, but they’re booked solid. If

you leave right now, you'll just make
it...

Despite everything, John is actually touched.

John’s voi

CONNIE (CONT'D)
It's Christmas Eve, John. I miss you.
Kevin does, too.

JOHN
I can’t.

CONNIE
The hell you can’t.

ce is choked with emotion:

JOHN
Connie...When Mary got sick...I kept
wishing there was something I could do to
stop it. Anything. But there wasn’t. It
was like there was this train coming
straight for me and I could see it but no
Matter what I did I couldn’t get out of
its way...I couldn’t stop it.

CONNIE
No one can stop it John. Look, planes are
going to crash. Earthquakes are going to
happen. People you know and love are
going to die, and no matter what that
fucking alien tells you, there’s nothing
you can do about it. You can’t save the
world, John. All you can do is try to
survive it.

Tears run down John's face. He forces out the words:

JOHN
It’s one year to the day. He told me she
was going to call. He said Mary was going
to call with the message.

A long beat of silence.

CONNIE
(gently)
He’s lying, John. Whoever calls might
sound like her, but it’s not going to be
her. I don’t know what happens after we
die, but I’ll bet wherever Mary is now,
she’s nowhere near Indrid Cold.

John cries openly now, emotion and fear shaking him.

JOHN
But what if it is her?
(almost a whisper)
I never even got to say goodbye.

CONNIE
(gently)
She’s dead, John.

A long silence as this reality finally sinks in for John --
maybe for the first time ever.

CONNIE (cont‘d)
(cont'd)
The only question now is how you want to
remember her.

John looks at the crumpled Polaroid. Just the three of them:
John, Mary -- and Mothman.

JOHN
I miss her so much...

CONNIE
I know you do. You can miss her here just
as easily as there. Maybe more easily,
cause you're all alone there, and that’s
no way to be.

Another silence. Then:

JOHN
I miss you, too.

CONNIE
(kindly)
Do whatever you have to do. I'll
understand. But down here, we have dinner
at six and do presents at eight. We’ll be
waiting for you.

And with that, Connie hangs up. John slowly sets down the
phone. It’s 11:59 AM.

He looks at his bags, still packed, lying in the entry hall
where he dumped them three days ago.

John looks back at the phone. The future...Or the past? The
living...Or the dead? He moves for the phone -- then reaches
past it and grabs...
THE WALL CORD. He holds it, gathers his courage...And though
it might be the most painful thing he’s ever done, he takes a
deep breath, stands up...

t rd_out £ ali!

Done. He pants a bit from the emotional effort. Maybe it
wasn’t so hard after all.

He opens the blinds. Light fills his apartment. He looks
around. For the first time in days -- maybe for the first
time in over a year -- John Klein feels truly free.

His eyes land on the bags in the entry hall. John goes to
them, grabs them up and heads for the door.

THE PHONE RINGS.

John freezes. He turns and looks at the phone. The frayed
wall cord lies coiled like a snake on the floor.

THE PHONE RINGS.
He looks at the clock. It’s 12:00 exactly.
THE PHONE RINGS.

John turns away. He grips the door knob, turns it and opens
the door.

THE PHONE RINGS.

John steps out into the hall. And closes the door behind him
on the empty apartment -- and the past -- as...

THE PHONE RINGS, AND RINGS, AND RINGS...

CLOSE ON POLAROID 200A

Mary and John smile on the beach. As the CAMERA PULLS BACK,
the Mothman evaporates from the upper right hand corner,
leaving only clear blue sky. The Mothman is gone.

We rise out of the clouds, following a 737 flying west.
INT. 737 - DAY 203

John glances around the cabin as passengers read their books
and newspapers, talk, listen to music.

J-4n closes his eyes, he sits back, relieved, smiling; he’s
ne longer the hunted, the nightmare is over. But as he looks
out the window...

OUT WINDOW - SKY 204
-. a storm is brewing over West Virginia.
INT. RED FORD ESCORT - HIGHWAY 35 - DAY 205

John peers past the icy, dry snow blasting across the
windshield. He fights to keep the car on the road, inching
along at 45 M.P.H. The radio report is grim:

RADIO NEWSMAN (V.O.)

(on radio)
..-national weather service is calling
for increased snow through tonight and...

EXT. HIGHWAY - TOLL BOOTH - DAY 206

John's car exits the highway, passing through the same eerie
tool booth as several days earlier.

RADIO NEWSMAN (V.0O.)
(continuous)
..-mational weather service is calling
for increased snow through tonight and...
...into tomorrow along the Ohio River
Valley. Ten to twelve inches is expected

John sees a MILEAGE SIGN loom up out of the snowy haze:

Snow falls in gray flurries as John’s car makes its way

across the final mile of Gallipolis, Ohio and approaches the
Ohio River and the 700 foot span of...

THE SILVER BRIDGE leading into Point Pleasant.

John’s car pulls up behind a line of cars stopped on the hill
leading down to the red light before the bridge.

INT. FORD ESCORT 208

John looks at the clock: 5:55 p.m. He may be late for dinner,
but not by much...

He happily drums on the steering wheel. “Have Yourself A
Merry Little Christmas” floats from the radio.

John waits...

EXT. SILVER BRIDGE - DUSK 209
Traffic is backed-up in both directions. Cars are loaded with
people -- on their way home, on their way to parties, on

their way to the mall for some last minute shopping.

INT. POLICE CRUISER 210
Connie sits in her cruiser, mid-span. She impatiently drums
her fingers on the steering wheel. People in other cars stare

at her - after all, she is a cop.

This is getting ridiculous...she turns on her flashers and
gets out of her car.

ON THE BRIDGE 211
Connie stands on tip-toes, looking down the long line of cars
to see what the hold up is. Far ahead, down at the Point
Pleasant end of the bridge, she sees...

A SIGNAL LIGHT: It’s red -- and shows no sign of changing.
Connie turns and gazes back down at...

THE OHIO END OF THE BRIDGE: Another red light. Connie barely
registers the Ford Escort waiting there, on the road leading
to the bridge.

INT. FORD ESCORT 212

John is getting antsy. What’s with the light? A burst of
static fogs the radio. He shuts it off, annoyed.

And in the sudden silence, he hears it. A SOUND. A faint
sound. A familiar sound...

ON THE BRIDGE . 213
Connie stands in the cold wind -- and hears the sound, too. A
low MOAN that rises to an eerie SHRIEK.

She looks around -- where the hell is that sound coming from?

IN OTHER CARS: 214
The bizarre sound echoes...

Lucy Griffin and her son Nat hear it.

Denise Smallwood hears it.

And a dozen other people we recognize from town -- they al]
hear the ominous sounds...

HILL LEADING DOWN TO THE BRIDGE 215

John climbs out of his car and heads down the the bridge.
Twenty yards ahead, A MAN is standing beside his car.

JOHN
What’s going on up there?

MAN
Some problem with the traffic lights.

John walks away. The CAMERA begins to CLOSE IN on his back.
John stops, sensing something. The CAMERA stops.

John whips around, looks directly at us. The CAMERA retreats,
but the SOUND is unmistakable now, and getting louder.
Moaning, howling, shrieking...That’s when John realizes:

It’s the sound from Josh Jessup’s phone calls.

And it seems to be coming from the bridge itself.
JOHN
Oh my God...

John stumbles backwards.

JOHN dashes across the intersection and runs...

John pounds on the hoods of the cars stacked up behind the
red light.

JOHN
Go! Go! Get off the bridge!

IN THE CARS: People are scared and confused. First the weird
noises, now this crazy man telling them to run the red light?
What the hell is going on?

Most don’t bother sticking around to find out.

ROAD LEADING ONTO THE BRIDGE 221
Slowly but surely the cars begin moving off the bridge...

ON THE BRIDGE 222
As the cold wind blows and snow blasts all around him, John
moves along the row of cars ordering people off the bridge
until he reaches...

But C.J. ignores John -- he’s got bigger problems...He stares
up at the wires and cables above the bridge.

BRIDGE SUPERSTRUCTURE OVERHEAD 226
C.J.’S POV: Shrouded in mist and snow, C.J. thinks he sees

something perched on a support tower. It looks kind of like a
giant bird...

ON THE BRIDGE 227
John looks back -- C.J. is blocking all the other cars. Screw
it -- he yanks the car door open.
C.J.

What the hell is that thing?!
John follows his terrified gaze up to...

THE SUPPORT TOWER: Nothing is there.

JOHN
What thing? What are you --

He glances back at C.J. and falls silent: C.J.’s face isa
picture of abject horror...

BRIDGE SUPERSTRUCTURE 230

C.J.'S POV: In the swirling snow he sees something. Something
alive -- with wings and two glowing red eyes...

Is it Mothman? Just when the image seems to firm up, a blast
of snow obscures it. The shadowy figure seems to tilt it’s
head back and we heer a HOWLING SHRIEK...

A FORMLESS GRAY MASS streaking toward him from the fog.

It coalescés before John’s eyes, revealing itself as...

A SEVERED CABLE: The thick wire whip-saws like a bolt of
lightning just inches in front of John’s face and smashes
through...

INSIDE C.J.'S IMPALA 233
C.J.’S WINDSHIELD, instantly killing him.

John backs away from the car in breathless horror. A giant
gust of wind blows. The ground sways sickly below his feet...

right before her eyes she can see the asphalt cracking
beneath her...

She scrambles to her feet and runs from car to car:

Move! Move! Get off the bridge!

People are desperate to comply. Problem is, they’re in the
middle of the traffic jam and couldn’t go anywhere even if
they wanted to.

It’s happening. The great tragedy is happening. And for the

do to stop it...

But he has to try. While everyone is moving off the bridge,
John starts running further on, heading straight for Connie!

The pavement buckles. John stumbles. The distance between

them seems to stretch, and the harder John runs the slower he

finish wrapping Connie’s fractured arm in a temporary cast
and dressing several cuts and wounds.

Finally, one nods at him: he can talk to her now.

John rushes to her side, holds her.

KEVIN
Mom!

He crashes into her, hugs her fiercely.

KEVIN (CONT'D)
I... I was afraid that...

He bursts into tears. Connie holds him, calms him.

John watches mother and son hold each other, overwhelmed with
relief that the incredibly fine line between miracle and
disaster in their lives didn’t get crossed.

Connie looks out across the devastated landscape; they are
surrounded by close to a_ hundred survivors, wrapped in
blankets, some already bandaged, others being tended to.

We recognize many who escaped tragedy thanks to John's
warnings.

She reaches out a hand. John takes it. Then he puts an arm
around both her and Kevin.

JOHN
Connie, remember when I said I was
brought here for a reason?

Connie looks into his eyes.

John leans in close, pressing his lips to hers. They kiss,
both knowing the answer.

Fire Chief Josh Jessup threads his way through the impromptu
field hospital. He trudges up to John, looking exhausted.

JOHN (CONT'D)

Point Pleasant, West Virginia.
