WE HEAR the distinct sound of a BMX bike, humming along.
BIRDS CHIRPING, a LAWN SPRINKLER, KIDS PLAYING nearby...

SUPER: SUMMER, 1984
DELAYED SUPER: IPSWICH, MASSACHUSETTS
AN ALLURING, MELODIC ‘80s SYNTH BEAT FADES IN OVER --

DAVEY (V.0.)
It’s easy to think of the suburbs as
a dead end. A weird Bermuda triangle
where the American dream strangles
all the excitement outta life. But
looks can be deceiving...

EXT. JUNIPER STREET - DAY

Newspaper bag slung over his shoulder, DAVEY ARMSTRONG (14)
cruises down the bucolic suburban street on his BMX. All you
need to know about the bright-eyed Davey is plastered on his
tee-shirt: “AREA 51 - I BELIEVE."

DAVEY (V.0.)
Just past the manicured lawns and
friendly waves, go inside any house.
Less than fifty feet from where you
sleep, entirely different lives are
playing out.

He watches his NEIGHBORS with curiosity. PEOPLE are out doing
yard work. KIDS are playing in the street.

DAVEY PEELS UP TO A MAILBOX. Grabs a paper -- Accidentally
DROPS IT revealing THE FRONT PAGE. A PICTURE OF A BOY (13)
beneath the headline, “NEWBURYPORT BOY STILL MISSING."

DAVEY (V.0.)
Behind the freshly painted walls next
door, anything could be happening and
you'd never know.

Davey’s eyes gleam at the headline as he scoops up the paper,
stuffs it into the mailbox. Speeds away...

AS HE PEDALS ALONG, Davey surveys the NEIGHBORS he passes...
DAVEY (V.0.)

Even serial killers live next door to
somebody...
2.

A BALDING NEIGHBOR (40s) mows his lawn. Waves at Davey as
Davey passes. Davey politely smiles, waves back. But as soon
as the neighbor isn’t looking, Davey’s eyes turn skeptical...

A YOUNG COUPLE argues with one another -- Stop at the sight
of Davey zipping past. Smile as he goes by. A facade.

AROUND THE BEND, a shirtless YOUNG MAN (20) we’ll come to
know as KYLE washes his TRANS-AM. Sees Davey. Flips him off.

DAVEY (V.0.)
But that’s what I love about it. It
always keeps you on your toes.

Davey pulls over to another mailbox at the foot of a long
driveway that leads to a well-maintained two-story colonial.
It reads "MACKEY."

DAVEY (V.0.)
When something you never saw coming
breaks the routine... that’s when
things get really interesting.

Davey opens the mailbox, stuffs a paper inside --

MAN’S VOICE (0.S.)
Davey! Hey, bud -- What’s going on?

Davey looks up to find WAYNE MACKEY (40s) walking down the

driveway toward him. He’s your average suburban bachelor: a
little tall, athletic shoulders, kind eyes. Type of guy who
should have a family by now but doesn’t seem in a rush.

DAVEY
Hey, Mr. Mackey...

Davey scans Mackey. Sees his clothes are covered in --

DAVEY

What’s with all the dirt?
MACKEY

Oh -- Ha. Yeah. Been doing some

planting in the garden.

DAVEY
There was no cash in your mailbox
yesterday. For the paper.

MACKEY
Has it been a month already? Jeez...
Actually, I was gonna ask if you had
a sec to help me lift something
inside?

(MORE )
MACKEY (CONT'D)
I can grab the money too. Kill two
birds with one stone?

INT. MACKEY’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Davey scans Mackey’s FAMILY PHOTOS while Mackey goes through
drawers in the kitchen.

FROM AN END TABLE, Davey picks up a FRAMED PHOTO of a smiling
TEENAGE BOY and his PARENTS.

Mackey comes up behind Davey. Hands him a $5 bill.

MACKEY
Knew I had it. Here ya go...

DAVEY
You’ve got a big family, huh?

Mackey scans all the pictures on the walls, tables...

MACKEY
Yeah, just make sure you don’t live
too close to em or they’1ll always be
in your business, am I right?

Mackey moves to a WOODEN BUREAU. Slaps a hand on its top.
MACKEY
This is it. Bought some new furniture
for upstairs. Need to get this hunka
junk down into the basement. Think we
can manage it?
INT. MACKEY’S HOUSE - BASEMENT - MOMENTS LATER

Mackey and Davey carry the bureau down the stairs. Davey
struggles -- He’s clearly bitten off the max he can chew.

MACKEY
Watch your step...

As they level out on the concrete basement floor, pass a
large furnace -- KACHUNK! -- It KICKS ON, scaring Davey --

WHAM! He drops the bureau --

MACKEY
Whoa, whoa! You okay?

DAVEY
Shit. Sorry.
MACKEY
Long as you didn’t get your foot,
it’s fine. We can rest a sec.

Davey appraises the UNFINISHED BASEMENT. Two dangling light
bulbs throw stark shadows against the sheetrock walls that
enclose THREE ROOMS.

MACKEY
Really appreciate the help. Flip side
of not living near family -- no one’s

ever around to help out.

Davey points to a cracked door. BLOOD RED LIGHT EMANATES from
behind it. Kinda creepy...

DAVEY
What’s in there?

MACKEY
That’s where we’re going. Think you
can make it the rest of the way?

Davey nods. They hoist the bureau again. He spots a PADLOCK
ON THE DOOR IN THE CORNER. Odd. Then they’re moving --

INT. MACKEY’S HOUSE - BASEMENT DARK ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
-- THUD! Davey and Mackey put down the bureau...

MACKEY
Heavy sonofabitch, huh...?

.. leaving Davey HUFFING AND PUFFING. Mackey CHUCKLES. He
looks oddly disturbing in the red glow. Everything does.

MACKEY
So, whattaya think? Putting the
finishing touches on my dark room.
Sort of an amateur photographer.
Figured this beast would be good to
store some equipment.

DAVEY
That’s cool. I’m sort of an amateur
videographer, so I get it...

MACKEY
Just like your old man. Boy, I
remember your parents walking you
around the block in a stroller. Now
look at you. How old are ya anyway?
DAVEY
Fourteen.

MACKEY
Fourteen? Shit. Perfect age. Wish I
could just freeze it for you.

DAVEY
Anyway, I gotta get home for dinner.

MACKEY
Of course. I can take it from here.
Send your folks my best.

Davey nods, heads back up the basement stairs as THE SOUND OF
KIDS YELLING OUT ECHOES OVER --

EXT. JUNIPER STREET - CUL-DE-SAC - HIGH ABOVE - NIGHT

A crystal clear New England summer night. Dense forest butts
up against the backyards of FIVE HOUSES that line a cul-de-
sac, each home separated by a sizeable yard.

NUMEROUS FLASHLIGHT BEAMS slice through the darkness. A
commotion of some sort. A search? No, it’s --

TEENAGED BOY (0.S.)
(echoing, from a distance)
Manhunt! We’re coming to get you
shitheads!

AS WE SWOOP DOWN, we find Davey running through a neighbor’s
pitch black backyard, dressed in all dark clothes.

DAVEY
Go-go-go!

A few other KIDS (12-15), also dressed in dark clothing,
scatter in all directions, looking for hiding spots.

WE STAY WITH DAVEY as he bolts into what we recognize as
MACKEY’S BACKYARD. Ducks behind a thick bush up against
Mackey’s house. Looks around. Doesn’t see anyone --

FARRADAY (0.S.)
Move over!

DAVEY JUMPS, turns to find CURTIS FARRADAY (14), AKA
“FARRADAY," his nerdy friend, squeezing in behind the bush.
Farraday's the kid puberty left behind -- high-pitched voice,
and about a head shorter than Davey with horn-rimmed glasses.
DAVEY
The hell, Farraday? Find your own
spot! You’re gonna get us caught!

FARRADAY
This is my spot!
DAVEY
Not right now -- Go!

Annoyed, Farraday slinks away. Davey listens. No movement.
Then HE HEARS MUFFLED, INDISCERNIBLE VOICES coming from --

INSIDE MACKEY’S HOUSE. Davey peeks into the window to find --

MACKEY, PHONE at his ear, sitting across the dining room
table from a TEENAGED KID (13). Scraggly red hair, acne,
freckles, GREEN ATARI shirt. Davey doesn’t recognize him.

Mackey shrugs apologetically, hangs up. No one answered. The
redhead nods, and Mackey says something that makes him LAUGH.
They head into another room and out of Davey’s sight...

WOODY (0.S.)
GOT YOU, DUDE!

Davey recoils as FLASHLIGHT BEAMS NAIL him. Squints past the
light to find DALE WOODWORTH, AKA, “WOODY” (14) and TOMMY
EATON, AKA, “EATS” (14) smiling down at him, victorious.

DAVEY
Jesus, Woody!

Woody’s a bear of a kid. The opposite of Farraday -- Puberty
came fast and furious. Eats is the punk of the group. Like a
character out of The Ramones. A wise-ass through and through.

WOODY
Hiding in Farraday’s spot, man? Lame.
You're better than that.

EATS
Davey, treehouse in fifteen. After we
catch this little bitch.

WOODY
He’s close. I can practically smell
the Noxzema on him.

As Woody and Eats dash into the night to continue the search,
Davey peers back into Mackey’s window. All’s quiet.
EXT. EATS’ HOUSE - SIDE YARD - NIGHT

A TREEHOUSE hangs in the limbs of a maple beside a classic
colonial house. A light glows inside as --

FARRADAY (0.S.)
I can’t wait to get laid...

INT. TREEHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Woody’s got a PORNO MAG in hand, Davey and Farraday on either
side of him. Woody and Farraday look particularly intoxicated
by the pictures of beautiful, NAKED WOMEN.

EATS
Aren’t you guys sick of looking at
those same chicks?

Sitting across from them, Eats sips from a flask.

DAVEY
Shit no, man.

FARRADAY
or even just feel-up a chick.

EATS
Second base? That’s it? I rounded
third once. She was hot, too.

WOODY
Just so happens to be a girl none of
us knows --

EATS
I was on vacation, dipshit.

WOODY
How convenient...

DAVEY
I'd be happy just to get on base with
Nikki.

FARRADAY

Oh, man. How is she so friggin hot?

EATS
Too bad she’s into my brother.

DAVEY
Kyle!? No way! He’s twenty and he
works at the hardware store.
FARRADAY
When’s he getting us more pornos? The
pages on this one are wearing off --

EATS
I told you, he said we can go fuck
ourselves.

FARRADAY
Tell him we’re trying to. That’s why
we need the porno mags.

The guys all have a LAUGH as Eats passes the flask to Woody.
Woody takes a sip -- COUGHS, GAGS --

WOODY
Thank God for this treehouse. Wish I
could just live up here instead of
with my mom...

DAVEY
I dunno how safe that’d be. With
those kids going missing --

EATS
Okay, here we go...

DAVEY
What.

EATS

Come on, we all know what you’re gonna
say. “It’s a conspiracy. It’s all
connected. The disappearances aren’t
random, they’re part of some vast
governmental alien cover-up.” Right?

Davey just stares at him a moment, not wanting to admit he’s
right, but --

DAVEY
So you don't think it's weird? Last
summer, a kid goes missing in
Hamilton. Now another kid disappears
in Newburyport...?

Eats and Farraday LAUGH. Davey looks to Woody for support.
WOODY

Davey, you're my best friend, but you
sound like a nutjob.
FARRADAY
Remember when he connected a Lite
Brite to his keyboard to try and
communicate with extraterrestrials?

EATS
Or when he swore there was a demonic
presence in his room cuz our houses
were built on Indian burial grounds?

DAVEY
That was like... three years ago! And
our houses were built on an Indian
burial ground --

FARRADAY
There’s literally no proof of that --

EATS
All right, are we done here? I gotta
beat off before my parents get home.

FARRADAY
Oh shit, good call. I'm outta here.

DAVEY
You guys are animals...

As Davey follows Farraday down the ladder, Eats grabs at the
porn mag in Woody’s hand, but Woody won't let go.

WOODY
No way! Thought you were tired of
looking at these same chicks.

EATS
I am. Why ya think I stopped bangin
your mom?

WOODY
You're dead!

Woody grabs Eats, they wrestle playfully as we --
INT. DAVEY’S HOUSE - DAVEY’S ROOM - LATER

The room is literally wallpapered with the front pages of

various tabloids: “Satanic Cult Abducting Children," “I was
Bigfoot’s Love Slave,” “Back from the Dead -- For Two Years I
was a Zombie," “Are UFOs Abducting Cows?” etc...

Davey’s in bed reading “THE HARDY BOYS: THE SHORE ROAD
MYSTERY." His mother, SHEILA (40s), enters.
10.

She has the big hair and business suit of a career woman, but
the gentle nature of a mom. She fixes his covers, takes the
book away.

SHEILA
You know you shouldn't read this
stuff before bedtime. Scary dreams.

DAVEY
Mom, I’m fourteen. You don’t need to
tuck me in anymore.

SHEILA
Maybe you don't need me to. Doesn't
mean I'm ready to give it up.

She kisses him on the forehead.

DAVEY
Think Dad's gonna be home soon?

SHEILA
I don't know, hon. You know how the
news is. Always something going on
that needs reporting. Sleep tight.

Sheila flicks off his bedroom light, closes his door. As soon
as she’s gone, Davey reaches under his bed, pulls out a GE
ROBOT STARCODE WALKIE TALKIE. Speaks softly --

DAVEY (INTO WALKIE)
Guys, Roller Palace tomorrow?

Davey hops out of bed. Grabs the BINOCULARS from his
nightstand and walks to the window ON THE OTHER SIDE OF HIS
ROOM. Pulls aside the curtains THAT FACE THE HOUSE NEXT DOOR.

BINOCULARS POV: A dimly-lit room. We can just barely make out
the shape of a bed, a nightstand...

FARRADAY (0.S.)(OVER WALKIE)
Scope some cuties? I’m in.

EATS (0.S.)(OVER WALKIE)
Hope that chick from last week is
there. She was all over me.

WOODY (0.S.)(OVER WALKIE)
You asked to touch her boobs and she
threw you over the railing.

Davey scans the other windows, but the neighboring house is
empty. No signs of life. He couldn’t be more disappointed...
11.

EATS (0.S.)(OVER WALKIE)
Bet I didn’t look half as dumb as
Davey every time he sees Nikki in the
DJ booth and bites it.

Davey’s disappointment suddenly turns to a devilish smile --

DAVEY (INTO WALKIE)
Know what doesn’t bite? The fact that
I can see her right now... Naked...

FARRADAY (0.S.)(OVER WALKIE)
Bullshit...

WOODY (0.S.)(OVER WALKIE)
If you're serious, I hate you.

DAVEY (INTO WALKIE)
Holy shit, she’s waving for me to
come over --

EATS (0.S.)(OVER WALKIE)
Okay, now I know you’re full of it.
Eats, out.

FARRADAY (0.S.)(OVER WALKIE)
I'd trade both my nuts to have that
view. She's like your private dancer.
(singing)
"A dancer for money. Do what you want
her to dooooo."

WOODY (0.S.)(OVER WALKIE)
Tina Turner? I fuckin love her!

FARRADAY (0.S.)(OVER WALKIE)
Dude, me too! I mean, I know we're
technically not her demographic but --

CLICK! Davey turns off his walkie, rolls his eyes. Returns to
bed and looks out the LARGE PICTURE WINDOW AT HIS BEDSIDE at
the entire cul-de-sac. The perfect view. He grabs his --
BINOCULARS POV: Davey’s magnified gaze scans the other homes
in the cul-de-sac, finally landing on MACKEY’S HOUSE DIRECTLY
ACROSS THE STREET. No lights on. Nothing out of the ordinary.
Davey hops back in bed, pulls the covers over his head as --
OVER BLACK

We HEAR RUSTLING, then... A RING OF LIGHT becomes a FLOOD OF
ILLUMINATION, revealing we’re --
12.

INSIDE A GARBAGE CAN, LOOKING UP AT DAVEY as he drops a LUMPY
GARBAGE BAG down onto us --

EXT. DAVEY’S HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY

Davey drops the lid back into place, covering his nose.
REFUSE is strewn across the deck around three garbage cans,
one of which is still knocked over. He looks over the
extraordinary mess and SIGHS. Pulls on YELLOW RUBBER GLOVES.

DAVEY
Can you at least make Mom double-bag
her meatloaf when she tosses it?
Smells like werewolf crap.

Davey’s father RANDALL (40s) supervises from the patio table
where he cleans the detached lens from a professional grade
BETAMAX CAMCORDER. CHANNEL SIX NEWS emblazoned on the side.

RANDALL
If you remembered to put the cinder
blocks on those bins like I told you,
we wouldn’t have this mess.

DAVEY
I hate raccoons. You should do an
exclusive. Get pest control in here.
I could film it...

RANDALL
Yeah, nice try. Camcorder’s off-
limits. It’s --

DAVEY
-- expensive, I know. How am I
supposed to become the next Spielberg
if I don’t practice?

Randall gives an amused smirk. CLICKS the lens back in place
and heads for the patio door.

RANDALL
Just make sure this patio’s clean
before you go anywhere, capiche?

EXT. DOWNTOWN IPSWICH - DAY
On their BMX bikes, clearly on a mission, bags of candy in

hand, the boys zip through the picturesque seaside downtown,
brushing past outraged PEDESTRIANS...
13.

EXT. ROLLER PALACE - ESTABLISHING - DUSK

A roller skating rink, parking lot filled. The SOUNDS of
Bananarama’s “CRUEL SUMMER" bleed into the night from inside
as the guys roll up on their bikes...

INT. ROLLER PALACE - A SHORT TIME LATER

The MUSIC POUNDS THE AIR as round and round the rink goes the
crowd of TEEN ROLLERSKATERS. Nearly in slow-motion, a
GORGEOUS TEEN GIRL glides past as...

Davey, Eats, Farraday and Woody stare, slack-jawed. Eats
nearly trips, almost takes Woody with him.

WOODY

Control yourself, ya psycho!
EATS

I can't -- I got needs, Woody!

They all LAUGH as Davey’s gaze floats up to the DJ in the
booth overlooking the floor.

NIKKI KASZUBA (17) bobs her head as she searches through a
stack of VINYLS for a next song. Glaringly hot and aloof,
she’s the kind of girl guys throw their virginity at.

Davey stares up at her dreamily, slowing his roll. The guys
track his gaze. And now they’re all entranced.

FARRADAY
Nikki Kaszuba. She’s like,
scientifically the perfect woman.

EATS
If she was my sitter I'da been bangin
her the second my balls dropped.

WOODY
Was it hard not to pop a boner every
time she gave you a bath?

DAVEY
It was four years ago, not ten. Calm
down. We just played games and shit.

EATS
What kind of games? Naughty games?

DAVEY
I hate you guys...

Davey skates off toward the --
14.

INT. ROLLER PALACE - BATHROOM HALLWAY - A SHORT TIME LATER

Davey skates out of the bathroom drying his hands.
SOMEONE GRABS HIM, SLAMS HIM AGAINST THE WALL --

NIKKI
Now you’re spying on me here too?

Davey’s eyes go wide -- It’s Nikki! And she knows!
words come out because HOLY SHIT IS THIS GIRL HOT!

NIKKI
Yeah, I know you pervs spy on me.

Davey’s heart is hammering in his chest.

NIKKI
Nothing to say? Really?
DAVEY
No, I just -- I never watch when
you're -- I mean, I don’t mean to
watch you, you’re just --
NIKKI
I’m just what?
DAVEY
perfect.

But

But no

The anger on Nikki’s face dissipates. She lets Davey go,
skates off. Davey watches after her, the weight of what just

happened sinking in. What did I just say!?

INT. ROLLER PALACE - RINK - CONTINUOUS

Davey rolls up on the other guys, who are plainly staring at
the asses of a GROUP OF OBLIVIOUS GIRLS a few feet ahead. He

still looks like he’s in shock.

FARRADAY
The hell happened to you?

DAVEY
Huh? Nothing...

EATS
You sure? We were worried maybe you
got kidnapped or something.

DAVEY
You’re such an asshole.
15.

EATS
Coming from you, that’s a compliment.
Now, watch as I show you dicknoses
how to score with the ladies...

Eats speeds toward the group of oblivious girls. The guys
quicken their pace to catch up, but as Davey rounds the loop,
past the DJ booth, he glances up to find NIKKI LOOKING BACK
AT HIM. THE MOMENT LASTS AN ETERNITY. SHE SMIRKS! Then --

WHAM! Davey trips, takes a ridiculous spill, skin SCREECHING
on the wood. A few SKATERS trip over him, causing a pile-up.

IN THE DJ BOOTH, Nikki plays the famous sound bite from The
Surfaris’ “WIPE OUT.” LAUGHTER fills the air as we --

INT. DAVEY’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Davey’s family sits around the TV eating dinner off TV TRAYS.
ON THE TV, a NEWS ANCHOR (40s) talks Summer Olympics...

NEWS ANCHOR (FROM TV)
now confirmed that 14 Eastern
Bloc countries, including the Soviet
Union, will boycott the Olympic Games
in Los Angeles later this summer...

RANDALL
Unbelievable. Cold War's never gonna
end. Davey, your future’s doomed.

Sheila hands a thick folder off the end table to Randall.

SHEILA
John dropped these off today.

RANDALL
Ah, great. Must be the fliers for the
block party.

Randall opens it.

RANDALL
Yup. They got a Beatles cover band to
play this year. Pretty neato.

DAVEY
Nikki’s not DJing like last year?
She’s amazing.

RANDALL
Probably not in the cards, what with
her parents getting a divorce.
16.

Davey blanches as his heart drops.

DAVEY
Nikki’s parents are getting divorced?

SHEILA
Where’d you hear that?

RANDALL
Bob Burnquist bowls with Mike
Kaszuba. Said it’s pretty ugly.
Supposedly, Mike’s not even living in
the house right now.

SHEILA
Let’s not gossip, Randall...
(thinking about it)
But that’s awful. I never would’ve
thought they were having problems.

RANDALL
That’s why they invented curtains,
hon.

SHEILA

Well, enough about that. At least the
block party sounds like it’1ll be fun.

DAVEY
Yeah, but why’s it always like the
last weekend before school starts?
RANDALL
That’s kinda the point, pal. Say
goodbye to summer fun with a bang.
INT. DAVEY’S HOUSE - DAVEY’S ROOM - A SHORT TIME LATER

Mind still on Nikki, Davey grabs his binoculars. Goes to the
side window and cautiously looks out at --

BINOCULARS POV: Nikki’s bedroom window. The lights are on,
but no one’s there. Davey focuses in on a FRAMED PHOTO on her
bedside table. It’s of Nikki and her MOM and DAD.

Davey lowers the binoculars, saddened as --

BRRRING! The HOUSE PHONE RINGS. Davey hurries into the --

HALLWAY. Grabs the phone off the wall. Before he can answer,
he hears VOICES ON THE LINE. He’s about to hang up when --
17.

RANDALL (0.S.)(OVER PHONE)
Wanna tell me what’s so urgent I
can’t just come in tomorrow?

The UNKNOWN CALLER SIGHS, unsure how to say that --

MALE VOICE (0.S.)(OVER PHONE)
Randall, it’s -- The Chronicle
received a letter from some guy
calling himself the “Cape Ann
Killer.” Claims he’s killed thirteen
teenaged boys over the last decade.

Davey’s eyes go wide. A moment of silence passes on the line.

MALE VOICE (0.S.)(OVER PHONE)
It’s legit. Story’s gonna break any
second. We need ya in here, pronto.

BACK IN HIS ROOM. Davey grabs the walkie-talkie as the VOICES
OF HIS PARENTS ECHO UP FROM DOWNSTAIRS. The front door SLAMS.

DAVEY (INTO WALKIE)
Guys! Something big is going down!

EATS (0.S.)(OVER WALKIE)
Someone’s going down on who?

DAVEY (INTO WALKIE)
I was right. Know those missing boys?
It’s a serial killer! My dad just got
called in!

FARRADAY (0.S.)(OVER WALKIE)
Holy shit, you’re not kidding. It’s
on the news right now.

Davey drops the walkie-talkie and races back down to the --
INT. DAVEY’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Sheila’s standing in front of the TV, remote control clutched
firmly to her chest. Davey sees the LIVE PRESS CONFERENCE
where DEPUTY SHERIFF LEWIS CALDWELL (50) addresses REPORTERS.

SHERIFF CALDWELL (FROM TV)
This afternoon, the Cape Ann Chronicle
received an anonymous letter from
someone claiming responsibility for
the deaths of thirteen teenaged boys.

Davey can’t believe what he’s hearing. He looks at Sheila.
She watches in stunned silence.
18.

SHERIFF CALDWELL (FROM TV)
The author also provided a list of
names, dates and pertinent details
related to a number of open missing
persons cases. We’ve confirmed the
accuracy of these statements and can
now officially label this person an
active serial killer.

ON SCREEN, the feed cuts back to the IN-STUDIO NEWS ANCHOR.

NEWS ANCHOR (FROM TV)
Sheriff's office reports they're
likely looking for a white male in
his late-30s to 40s, living alone.
Preferred targets appear to be males,
aged 12 to 16 --

CLICK. Sheila turns off the TV. Knuckles white on the remote.
Tense silence fills the void, until --

SHEILA
I just, I can’t believe something --

INT. DAVEY’S HOUSE - DAVEY’S ROOM - LATER
CLOSE ON Davey’s face, a familiar glimmer in his eye --

DAVEY
-- like this could happen here! It
could be anybody! This is the coolest
thing that’s ever happened to us!

All four guys are here, though from their HUSHED VOICES, it’s
obvious they’re not supposed to be.

WOODY
They said he hunts guys our age.
Think maybe we should cool it with
the late night Manhunts?

FARRADAY
Why? None of the missing kids are from
Ipswich. And Cape Ann's wicked big --

DAVEY
It’s not that big. How’re you not
freaking out that something’s finally
happening in this town?

EATS
Because there’s no way it’s gonna hit
us or this neighborhood. We love you,
man, but look at this place.
19.

The guys scan the room: an “Area 51” poster hangs on the wall
beside a large framed still of the classic Patterson-Gimlin
Big Foot video. Alien figurines and toys cover most surfaces.
A large cross adorns a wall, garlic hanging from it.

EATS
You’re desperate for crazy shit to
happen. You hear a news story and
suddenly every boogeyman in these
magazines lives down the street.

Farraday grabs the BINOCULARS. Looks out the SIDE WINDOW --

DAVEY
Excuse me for being the only one to
hear there’s a serial killer on the
loose in Cape Ann and get a --

FARRADAY (0.S.)
Boner! Holy shit!

All the guys crowd to the window to follow Farraday’s gaze.
Could only be one thing. Eats scrambles to grab the extra set
of BINOCULARS Davey keeps near the window.

EATS
Move over, Woody! Fat ass!

Eats ducks down at Woody’s knees, and as the four adolescent
guys gaze out, WE SEE --

BINOCULARS POV: NIKKI, IN HER WINDOW. Undressing. Her back to
our boys, she slips off her bra. Sunkissed skin, the graceful
curves of her shoulders and bare neck achingly feminine.

FARRADAY
I bet her hair smells like Vidal
Sassoon.

EATS

Definitely. If I was over there right
now, she’d be pregnant.

DAVEY
Guys, show her a little respect. Her
parents are getting divorced.

A moment of silence passes... Then --

FARRADAY
Statistically that means she’s, like,
78 percent more likely to engage in
pre-marital sex.
20.

DAVEY
You guys are disgusting.

EATS
Whatever, dude, you were thinking it.

FARRADAY
Bank it and spank it.

Woody wrestles the binoculars from Farraday, SNEAKS A PEEK
for himself. His jaw instantly drops.

WOODY
I feel like I just discovered the
meaning of life. Davey, you gotta get
with her, man.

Davey looks out at Nikki with a look of pure intoxication.
It’s not lust in his eyes, it’s something more. Until --

NIKKI SPINS -- REALIZES SHE’S BEING WATCHED!

EATS
Shit-get-down!

The guys drop to the floor, BUT DAVEY’S FROZEN. He meets
Nikki’s gaze --

WOODY (0.S.)
Dude...!

Woody yanks him to the floor and OUT OF FRAME. Far too late.

DAVEY (0.S.)
I’m so fucked...

EXT. FARRADAY’S HOUSE - ESTABLISHING - DAY

Another upper-middle-class, two-story colonial on the cul-de-
sac. We can see Davey’s house a couple driveways over.

INT. FARRADAY’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Stuffing sandwiches in their faces, Farraday and Davey hover
over a newspaper. The headline reads, “THE CAPE ANN KILLER -
15 CONFIRMED VICTIMS AND COUNTING.”

DAVEY
The Cape Ann Killer. So rad. Dude,
look at this --

Davey runs his finger along a PHOTO of the killer’s letter.
It includes a LIST OF NAMES. The victims. Right there in
black and white, next to the info hotline number.
21.

DAVEY
Now that we have their names, I bet
we can find details of their
disappearances at the library --

FRANCINE
Absolutely not!

FRANCINE FARRADAY (40s), sets a bowl of Doritos between the
boys. Just looking at her, you can see the conservative,
razor-sharp intellect of a clinical psychiatrist.

FRANCINE
And if I find out you did, I’m
calling your mother, David. Besides,
Curtis has homework.

FARRADAY
So stupid. Everyone else gets to hang
out all summer. I hate the academy --

FRANCINE
My son is not going to be the first
Farraday without a Ph.D. from an Ivy
League school. Period.

CURTIS FARRADAY, SR. joins the boys at the table with a
salad. He stabs a finger onto the paper.

CURTIS SR.
Makes me sick. The media supporting
the name this psychopath gave himself
like he’s in the damn World Wrestling
Federation. Whoever he is, he’s
clearly deranged and beyond help.

FRANCINE
All serial killers are beyond help.
That’s why they’re serial killers.
They can't stop themselves.

DAVEY
Why do they call em serial killers?

FRANCINE
“Serial” just means “many.” So it’s
someone who’s driven to murder
multiple people over many years.

CURTIS SR.
We’ve both done some research into
the subject. Francine more than me.
22.

DAVEY
Can you tell us about some of em?

FRANCINE
Oh, I don’t think it’s appropriate.

CURTIS SR.
If they don’t hear it from us, Dear,
you can be sure they’1l learn about
it from the G.D. news...

Francine considers. Nods agreement.

FRANCINE
Well, this country’s seen its fair
share. H.H. Holmes was the first one
documented. Built a hotel in Chicago.
Called it his “Murder Castle.”

CURTIS SR.
No one knows how many people he
killed there. Probably hundreds.

Davey and Farraday’s eyes light up like the fourth of July.

CURTIS SR.
Then there’s Ed Kemper, “The Co-Ed
Killer.” John Wayne Gacy, “The Killer
Clown.” Guy actually dressed up like
a clown for the kids in his
neighborhood. Never trust a clown.

FRANCINE
Ted Bundy, “The Lady Killer.” My
favorite.

FARRADAY
Mom...! Gross!

FRANCINE
Meaning he’s fascinating. He
confessed to murdering thirty women.
Used his good looks to seduce, kidnap
and kill his victims. Some serials
even keep items from their victims,
which we call “trophies.” These are
deeply disturbed individuals.

CURTIS SR.
The list goes on and on. All with
sensational names to sell newspapers
and gain ratings. The news media
disgusts me. No offense to your
father, Davey.
23.

DAVEY
But why would the Killer write this
letter after all this time?

FRANCINE
To raise the stakes. Make it more of
a thrill, and show how confident he
is that he won’t be caught. He thinks
he’s smarter than the police, and
he’s trying to prove it.

Francine scoops the newspaper off of the counter. Peers down
at it, shaking her head in disgust as she walks over...

FRANCINE
We thought this town was insulated
from all the madness out there. But
even Ipswich isn’t safe anymore...

and drops it into the trash bin --
INT. IPSWICH PUBLIC LIBRARY - MICROFICHE LAB - DAY

Mere feet away from an oblivious OLD WOMAN (70s), Eats
jokingly humps a bookcase. Ipswich isn’t safe anymore indeed.
He’s got Woody in stitches as nearby --

FARRADAY
Guys, cut the shit! Unlike you, I
actually come here to study so don't
get me kicked out.

NEWSPAPER from Farraday's house on his lap, Davey sits at a
MICROFICHE MACHINE. Farraday loads in a SHEET. Maneuvers
through pages of OLD NEWSPAPER ARTICLES.

FARRADAY
Just use these knobs to scroll, find
the articles you want. Easy...

Davey takes the wheel. Uses the current paper as reference.
Starts searching for VICTIMS’ NAMES. AS HE SCROLLS, WE SEE --

QUICK CUTS OF DISTURBING HEADLINES, LAST PHOTOGRAPHS OF
SMILING VICTIMS --

A BLOND BOY .... A FAT BOY .... A SHAGGY BOY .... MORE BOYS,
ALL TEENAGERS. And then a break in the pattern --

A FULL FAMILY (MOM, DAD, TWIN TEENAGED BOYS) AND A SHOT OF
THEIR CRIME SCENE: A DINNER TABLE WITH BLOOD SPLOTCHES IN
FRONT OF EVERY CHAIR.

TIME FLIES BY as one by one, he crosses names off the list.
24.

FARRADAY
I can’t look at this stuff anymore.

Farraday gets up and walks off. But Davey’s eyes are wide
with morbid fascination. HE’S HOOKED.

WE SEE MORE GROTESQUE SHOTS OF THE CAPE ANN KILLER’S WORK as
Davey tracks the killer’s activities across MONTHS, YEARS --

PLOP! A MAGAZINE SPREAD drops in front of his face. A PAIR OF
BARE AFRICAN TRIBAL BREASTS close enough to motorboat.

EATS
BOOM! Afri-CANS... Get it?

DAVEY
You guys aren’t gonna believe the
shit I found --

Davey turns to find Eats and Woody. A stack of NATIONAL
GEOGRAPHIC magazines in their hands, AKA the best source of
porn a fourteen year old can easily get his hands on.

EATS
Forget what you found -- We snagged
enough tribal muff to carpet your
house. We’re back in business.

Eats stuffs a pair of NatGeos down the front of his pants.

DAVEY
The hell are you doing!?

EATS
Free porn, bro.

EXT. JUNIPER STREET - CUL-DE-SAC - NIGHT

Dressed in black, Davey and the guys shoot the shit with the
usual crew of MANHUNT KIDS as the last of the sun sets --

DAVEY
Okay, where the hell’s Sammy? We need
him or we don’t have numbers.

NEIGHBORHOOD KID 1
I dunno. We haven’t heard from him in
a few days.
By the look on everyone’s faces, that’s not normal.

DAVEY
Are they home?
25.

NEIGHBORHOOD KID 2
Car’s in the driveway. They must be.

EATS
Let’s go get the little shit. Woody,
stay here, make sure none of these
dickweeds leave.

EXT. THE HOFFMAN HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

KNOCK-KNOCK-KNOCK -- Davey, Eats and Farraday await a
response... that doesn’t come. Eats and Farraday peek into
the windows beside the door...

FARRADAY
No movement.

EATS
Or lights. Oh well...

DAVEY
Oh well? You don't think this is a
little weird? No one's seen Sammy in
days. What if --

EATS
Don't even say it! They're probably
up at the lake or some shit.

DAVEY
Then why's their car here?

Davey goes to the Hoffmans' nearby station wagon. Squints in
the windows... Nothing out of the ordinary.

FARRADAY
Maybe they rented one...?

DAVEY
Why would they --

EATS
Who cares? The real issue is that we
don't have numbers because of the
little prick, so now I can't play
Manhunt. Whatever, I'm out.

FARRADAY
I'm gonna go catch up on my summer
reading. Fuckin homework. Later.

Fun extinguished. Eats and Farraday head off...
26.

But Davey lingers. He approaches the front door, peers into
the darkened windows, morbid curiosity boiling over. He
casually TRIES THE FRONT DOOR KNOB, but it's locked. Bummer.

Davey turns around. Takes in the view from the Hoffmans' --
An unobstructed view of Mackey's backyard. Hmm...

INT. DAVEY’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

Davey puts the finishing touches on a PB&J. Grabs the jelly,
reaches for the refrigerator door -- Sees a NOTE WRITTEN IN
MARKER on the MAGNETIZED REFRIGERATOR WHITEBOARD:

“DATE: 6/29 MESSAGE: Working late again. Get a pizza. Call
one of the neighbors in case of an emergency.”

ON THE BOTTOM OF THE WHITEBOARD, a LIST of NAMES and PHONE
NUMBERS: “Farraday, Mackey, Woodworth, Eaton,” etc...

Davey puts the jelly back in the fridge, grabs the milk.

Pours himself a glass and places the CARTON on the counter.
Takes a glorious bite of the PB&J. Swigs the milk --

NEARLY CHOKES at the PICTURE ON THE BACK OF THE MILK CARTON --
“DUSTIN ‘DUSTY’ DEWITT - MISSING SINCE 6/2/84"

IT’S THE RED-HEADED KID HE SAW AT MACKEY’S HOUSE! HOLY! SHIT!
INT. TREEHOUSE - A SHORT TIME LATER

The flickering light of CANDLES on the table in the center of
the space gives a slightly crazy gleam to the eyes of --

DAVEY
Mackey's the Cape Ann Killer!

He looks like a man possessed. A prolonged silence hangs
between Eats, Farraday and Woody.

FARRADAY
I knew we shouldn’t have taken you to
the library. I blame myself.

EATS
I also blame Farraday.

DAVEY
I know it sounds kinda ridiculous --

EATS
Yeah, because it is. As soon as that
news report came out, we all knew it
was just a matter of time til you --
27.

WHAM! Davey slaps the MILK CARTON onto the table.

EATS
Congrats, you’re getting your
calcium, so what?

DAVEY
No, man, look --

Davey points at the picture of DUSTY DEWITT. The guys grab
the carton. Take a closer look at the picture.

FARRADAY
Who’s the missing ginger?

DAVEY
That’s the kid I saw in Mackey’s
dining room a few weeks ago! When we
were playing Manhunt!

WOODY
How sure are you it's him?

DAVEY
Never been more sure of anything in
my entire life.

EATS
That’s a low bar. Plus, redheads all
look the same.

FARRADAY
So true.

WOODY
Did you tell your parents?

DAVEY
No way! They'd never believe me, and
they'd ground me. I need proof. Guys,
I was only like ten feet away! I saw
him clear as day! That’s him!

Eats and Farraday study the carton, considering this insane
possibility.

DAVEY
Plus, what about the Hoffmans? Their
lakehouse is only a couple hours
north, but their car's still here?
Something's definitely off. And they
have a perfect view of Mackey's yard.
28.

EATS

DAVEY
So, what if one of the Hoffmans saw
Mackey with Dusty in the yard --

WOODY
Who?

FARRADAY
The missing ginger.

DAVEY
-- Mackey found out somehow, and then
killed them to get rid of the threat.

Silence. Everyone thinking over the details...
WOODY

Look, I'll admit this is all pretty
weird, but that's kind of a stretch.

FARRADAY
Eats, tell him what Kyle said.
EATS
Farraday, what the fuck --
DAVEY
What'd Kyle say? Does he know
something?
EATS

Goddammit. Fine. He said Mackey comes
into the hardware store every week
and buys like fifty pounds of dirt.
Says it’s for his garden --

DAVEY
His garden!? Bullshit! Who uses fifty
pounds of dirt a week in a backyard
garden? He’s also got a room in his
basement with a padlock on the door.
He’s single and he lives alone. Why
would he need that?

Davey plops down the CAPE ANN CHRONICLE. Points at a section
on the front page beneath the “CAPE ANN KILLER” headline --

DAVEY
Still not convinced?
(reading)
(MORE )
29.

DAVEY (CONT'D)
“Suspect is likely a white male,
late-30s to 40s, lives alone...”

EATS
Dude, Mackey’s a cop. With a sick
reputation --

DAVEY
That’s what’s genius about it! He
knows police tactics. He could plant
evidence to throw them off, or
destroy it if they ever found
anything bad. Who would suspect a
cop? It’s the perfect cover.

A sense of dread spreads around the table. He's got a point.

DAVEY
Guys, if Mackey is what I think he
is, we've gotta do something.

WOODY
Yeah, we gotta call the cops.

DAVEY
Have you not been listening? We
report anything to the cops, Mackey
will find out. Then he could just
destroy the evidence. Or walk over
and silence us. Permanently.

EATS

Okay, Magnum, P.I. What’s your plan?
DAVEY

We have to find out the truth -- And

be able to prove it. This is all
circumstantial; we’ve gotta find
real, hard evidence. Which means...

Mischief in his eyes, Davey smiles big. It's infectious as
smiles wipe across every face around the table. Even Eats'.

FARRADAY
Stakeout?

DAVEY
Search and destroy. Who’s with me?

WOODY
I'll bring the snacks. Davey, you get
the gear.
30.

EATS
This is batshit crazy. I'm in.

Exhilarated, Davey puts his hand out -- Woody's, Farraday's
and Eats' quickly SLAP down on top of it.

DAVEY
Operation Mack Attack starts now!

STAKEOUT MONTAGE

A SERIES OF SHOTS over an UPBEAT ‘80s SYNTH JAM -- OPERATION
MACK ATTACK in full swing:

-- Mackey tosses a DUFFEL BAG into his immaculate 1980 JEEP
WAGONEER, drives off. HIDING IN THE BUSHES, DAVEY lowers his
binoculars, jots down the time...

-- AT DUSK, Farraday hunkers down INSIDE HIS PARENTS’ PARKED
CAR as MACKEY’S WAGONEER rolls past heading into his
driveway. Farraday jots down the time...

-- IN HIS ROOM, Davey adds NOTES to a LARGE WHITEBOARD. Their
accumulated observations, laid out by day and time. It’s
starting to fill up...

-- ON HIS PAPER ROUTE, Davey chucks a NEWSPAPER. It lands on
a perfectly manicured lawn. WE SEE THE HEADLINE: “FEAR ACROSS
CAPE ANN REACHES FEVER PITCH.”

-- DURING A MANHUNT GAME, Davey peeks in Mackey’s windows.
Finds Mackey doing laundry. Sensing something, Mackey looks
out the window to find -- Nothing. Davey ducked just in time.

-- FROM HIS TREEHOUSE, Eats looks up from a porno mag to spot
Mackey eating dinner. Boooorrrring. Eats jots down the time,
goes back to his magazine, unfurling a centerfold. Yowza...

-- ON THE WHITEBOARD in his room, Davey adds MORE NOTES to
each day. Most days and times are filled in...

-- ON HIS PAPER ROUTE, Davey pulls a NEWSPAPER from his bag,
looks at the news headline: “FBI CONSULTED IN CAPE ANN KILLER
INVESTIGATION.”

-- Mackey wipes sweat as he digs in his GARDEN. ABOVE HIM,
HIDING IN A TREE, WOODY jots down a note...

-- FROM HIS BEDROOM WINDOW, Davey watches Mackey drive off.
He turns his binoculars to check THE HOFFMAN HOUSE. Still no
one home. Davey jots down notes...
31.

-- Davey finishes adding a note to the WHITEBOARD and steps
back. It’s full of notes from the stakeout. A week in the
life of Mackey, HIS ENTIRE SCHEDULE, in black and white.

END MONTAGE
EXT. BEACH - ONE WEEK LATER - DAY

FOURTH OF JULY BANNERS strung from lifeguard towers float on
the wind above the crowded beach. Families play and swim in
the sand and surf beneath the golden sun.

ON A LARGE BEACH BLANKET, Davey, Eats, Farraday and Woody are
huddled around a NOTEBOOK --

DAVEY
Okay, run down. He leaves his house
every day at 8:24 with the same
duffel bag. Contents unknown. Grabs
the last day’s mail on the way out.

FARRADAY
Returns home with the bag around
6:25. Goes into the house through the
garage door and closes it behind him.
Always closes it!

WOODY
He gardens. A lot. Like, five days a
week. Veggies. Probably.

EATS
He has dinner alone every night at
7:00... ish. Then probably wanks it

and cries himself to sleep. Loser.
BEEP! BEEP! BEEP! Eats’ CASIO CALCULATOR WATCH goes off.

EATS
Bikini break! One minute!

The guys turn as one to look across the sand and gawk at --

NIKKI, in a DNA-stirring bikini, tosses a football with a
couple other GIRLFRIENDS and a few ripped SENIOR GUYS. Dicks.

EATS
God I wish I was that bikini.

FARRADAY
I should've worn baggier trunks...

Davey watches Nikki. Longing. Smiles to himself.
32.

DAVEY
So amazing how, like, everyone loves
her, ya know?

The guys shoot Davey a disgusted look --

FARRADAY
What the fuck are you saying...?

DAVEY
No, I just mean she’s got a lot to
offer the world...

BEEP! BEEP! BEEP! The Casio alarm shatters their daydreaming.

EATS
If you're done being a bitch, can we
get back to work, please?

But DAVEY'S GAZE REMAINS ON NIKKI as she bounces to and fro
with the football. It’s pure heaven.

WOODY (0.S.)
Well, we know his schedule now, so
what do we do next?

Nikki, as if sensing she’s being watched, looks over at
Davey. She smiles. We melt.

DAVEY
(inspired)
Catch this fucker and become heroes.
EXT. JUNIPER STREET - CUL-DE-SAC - NIGHT

BINOCULARS POV: Davey’s parents pull out of the driveway,
gussied up for a night out. As they drive off...

DAVEY (0.S.)
We're clear...

The binoculars scan... Find MACKEY’S HOUSE. NO LIGHTS ON.

DAVEY (0.S.)
on all fronts.

EXT. EATS’ HOUSE - SIDE YARD - CONTINUOUS
A small tent, walls glowing with lantern light from inside,

makes the perfect stakeout spot. EXCEPT IT’S EMPTY. Because
all the action’s currently happening up in the --
33.

EATS (0.S.)

+ come on, no way. How can you say
that? They’re fuckin teddy bears! You
think a buncha Teddy Ruxpins could
take down the Empire?

INT. TREEHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

DAVEY’S FULL WHITEBOARD now hangs next to a pinned up PLAYBOY
page with a NAKED CHICK who looks an awful lot like Nikki.

Davey, decked out in his black “Manhunt” clothes, lowers his
binoculars as his parents’ car disappears. He turns to find
the rest of the gang, also dressed in black --

FARRADAY
They’re aliens, and highly
intelligent! Look how fast that one
learned to drive a speeder bike, then
ditch it without being spotted.

EATS
Whatever, dude. They’re bears. Now if
it was Gremlins, I’d buy it. Maybe.

DAVEY
I gotta get my parents to take me to
see that. Maybe go with Nikki.

EATS
Sure, then she can find out what
happens if she gets your Mogwai wet.

The guys all LAUGH as HEADLIGHTS sweep across the cul-de-sac.
They instantly pile into the large treehouse window. Davey
whips his binoculars up to watch as --

BINOCULARS POV: Mackey’s Wagoneer pulls into his driveway.
Mackey gets out, looks around at the sleepy neighborhood.
Does he sense he’s being watched?

EATS
What the hell’s he doing?

BINOCULARS POV: After a moment, Mackey walks toward his house
-- but goes around the side of the garage to the backyard.

WOODY
Davey, where’s he --

The SOUNDS OF HEAVY DRAGGING snap their attention back to --

BINOCULARS POV: Mackey emerges onto his driveway again,
pulling his GARBAGE CANS behind him.
34.

He takes them to the curb. Heads back inside. The garage door
closes behind him. A few of the lights in his house pop on.

IN THE TREEHOUSE, Davey lets out the breath he didn’t realize
he was holding. Woody and Eats lower their binoculars.

FARRADAY
Wait, was that it? Stakeout over?

EATS
Let’s break into his garage.

WOODY
We can’t do that. He’s a cop.

DAVEY
Guys, this is a stakeout. We know his
patterns now. So we just sit back,
watch and wait to see if anything
strange happens.

Davey brings the binoculars back to his eyes --
BINOCULARS POV: Davey scans, lands on MACKEY’S GARBAGE CANS.

DAVEY
Or if an opportunity presents itself.

WOODY
At least we got snacks...

INT. TREEHOUSE - LATER

Every bag of snacks is shredded, empty. NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC
magazines discarded like spent hookers. Farraday, alone,
rolls a twenty-sided die on the floor. Consults a D&D Dungeon
Master Guide. A few HEAVY THUMPS draw his gaze to the ROOF --

FARRADAY (INTO WALKIE)
Woody, you rolled a sixteen. Your elf
is trapped in a teleportation maze.
You coming back soon or what?

EXT. TREEHOUSE ROOF - CONTINUOUS

SQUAWKING walkie at his feet, Woody struggles under the
weight of Eats on his shoulders.

EATS
We're trying to scope Nikki’s tatas
and you’re talking about an elf?

WOODY
Can you see her or not?
35.

Eats raises his binoculars. Now WE SEE he’s trying to peep
over Davey’s roof to Nikki’s window. He needs to go --

EATS
Higher, ya bearded freak of nature.

WOODY
You’re so much fatter than you look!

DAVEY (0.S.)(OVER WALKIE)
Guys! I can hear you down here!

INT. TENT - SIDE YARD - CONTINUOUS

Davey, the only one still focused, lies with his binoculars
sticking out the flap of the tent. Trained on Mackey’s house.

FARRADAY (0.S.)(OVER WALKIE)
Davey, man. Maybe we should call it.
What’re you even hoping to see?

Suddenly, finally, THE LIGHTS IN MACKEY’S HOUSE GO OFF.

DAVEY
That.

EXT. MACKEY’S HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Under cover of darkness, Davey runs across the street,
crouches behind the garbage cans. He watches Mackey’s windows
cautiously. No lights appear. The other guys catch up to him.

FARRADAY
What the hell’re we doing!?

Davey puts his hand on one of the garbage cans. Smirks.

EATS
His fuckin trash? Are you kidding?

DAVEY
There could be evidence in here.
Fingers or bloody rags or something.
We find anything, we got him.

FARRADAY
Do you guys know me at all? I am not
digging through trash.

WOODY
We're gonna get in trouble if we tear
up his trash on the street.
36.

DAVEY
I’ve had to clean our deck three
times in the last two weeks because
raccoons keep getting into ours.
That’s all anyone’s gonna think.

The guys look at each other, disgusted. But what the hell?

EATS
If I find a used condom in here...
I’m gonna be so jealous.

LATER

TRASH covers the base of the driveway. The guys’ hands and
clothes caked in grime, sludge and worse. Except for
Farraday, who sits a safe distance back on the curb.

FARRADAY
How do you know you can’t get AIDS
from trash?

EATS
Only way you're ever gettin AIDS...

FARRADAY
Yeah, good one. Don’t call me
tomorrow when you’re puking blood.

Davey tosses another EMPTY BAG onto the ground. Frustrated.

DAVEY
I can’t believe it. Nothing. Maybe he
doesn’t do the killings here?

WOODY
He could have, like, a lair or
something somewhere...?

EATS
A lair? He’s Cobra Commander now?

Farraday, still off to the side, spots Mackey’s MAILBOX.
Opens it, looks inside to find --

FARRADAY
What about his mail? Can tell a lot
about someone by the magazines
they’re subscribed to...

Big smile on his face, he digs out a brand new PLAYBOY, still
in its cellophane wrapper.
37.

EATS
Ask and you shall receive!

Eats is all smiles as he snatches it, rips it open, tosses
the cellophane into the garbage pile and pages through it.

DAVEY
Farraday’s right. We can check his
mail every day and he’1l never
suspect a thing. See what bills he
gets, who’s sending him stuff...

Eats tucks the Playboy into his waistband. Per the usual.

EATS
I’1l handle that responsibility.

Of course he will. Davey checks his watch.

DAVEY
It’s 10:30. We should get outta here
before my parents come back and see
us. We can try again tomorrow.

FARRADAY
Night one, no luck.

EATS
Well, a little bit of luck --

Eats pats the magazines tucked beneath his waistband, smiles.
As he and Farraday peel off toward their respective homes --

WOODY
Hey Davey? Is it cool if I sleep over
tonight? Kinda don't wanna be home.

DAVEY
Yeah, I was gonna ask you to anyway.
I'll make popcorn and we can watch
"Close Encounters."

WOODY
Awesome. I'll go grab my stuff. Be
over ina bit.

INT. DAVEY’S HOUSE - DAVEY’S ROOM - NIGHT

Davey’s sitting at his window, Hardy Boys book in hand. But
his gaze is fixed on Mackey’s house. What’s happening in
there? Is someone over there in the dark, crying, praying --

DING-DONG! Davey JUMPS at the SOUND OF THE DOORBELL. Fuck! He
gives the clock an accusatory look. 11:47pm. It's about time!
38.

INT. DAVEY’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Davey bolts down the stairs, grabs the front door and swings
it open, revealing --

DAVEY
Dude, what took you so long?

NIKKI. She doesn’t wait for him to pick his jaw up off the
floor as she breezes past him into the house wearing a sexy
cut-off tee and short-shorts.

NIKKI
Expecting somebody this late?

DAVEY
Huh? Oh, just Woody -- My friend, I
mean. Not, uh -- Nevermind.

NIKKI

Wow, I haven’t been over in awhile.
Your mom moved everything.

DAVEY
Uh -- I guess. Like a year ago.

Nikki continues into the kitchen, grabs a soda from the
fridge like she lives here.

NIKKI
Your folks aren’t home?

DAVEY
Nah, date night.

Nikki smirks, CRACKS the soda and it sprays the air. She
takes a long, luscious sip, her eyes never leaving Davey. She
wipes her wet lips and gives him an amused look --

NIKKI
Good.

-- winks and walks confidently to the stairs. Heads up...

HOLY. SHIT. Is this happening right now? He realizes he’s
just standing there alone. Bolts after her --

INT. DAVEY’S HOUSE - DAVEY’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Davey flies into the room to find Nikki, already at his side
window, binoculars up to her eyes.
39.

NIKKI
Huh... Better view of my room than I
thought.

DAVEY

I’ve never seen you naked!
Instantly mortified, Davey blushes. Grabs the binoculars.

NIKKI
Too bad. I’ve got a great body.

What!? Nikki smirks and walks away from the window.

Equal parts embarrassed and turned on, Davey starts
straightening up, stashing toys and nerd paraphernalia under
his bed, in the closet. Wherever he can.

But Nikki’s focused elsewhere, her hands tracing along the
peeling National Enquirer covers that wallpaper his room.

NIKKI
Wow... When I gave you that first
National Enquirer, I never thought
it’d lead to this. What was that one
again...? The cult that was, like,
brainwashing Elvis' daughter for his
money, right?

Davey points to the wall where the cover of that National
Enquirer permanently rests above his bed. Nikki smiles.

NIKKI
We had so much fun. God, sucks how
much things have changed.

DAVEY
Things have changed, but good things.
Like, we're old enough to hang out
together now.

Totally onto his clumsy attempt at being suave, she lets her
finger gently touch his hand. Clearly having fun making him
squirm.

NIKKI
Too bad I'm leaving. Guess we better
get it all in now.

Her big eyes lock onto his, gleaming with mischievous intent.
Every gasket in Davey's brain about to blow, he remembers --

DAVEY
How, uh -- how’re your parents?
40.

NIKKI
Let’s stick to yours. What time did
you say they’d be home?

Uhhhhh... Mind. Frozen. She moves closer to Davey
CLOSER... THEIR LIPS ABOUT TO MEET... THIS IS IT -

  

THUD! They HEAR the DOOR OPEN AND CLOSE DOWNSTAIRS!

SHEILA (0.S.)
Davey! We’re back!

DAVEY
Oh, fuck me.

Nikki LAUGHS OUT LOUD at his reaction, slaps a hand over her
mouth. They share a look of excited amusement, then she
rushes to the window. Climbs out using the roof of the garage
to get down to the ground safely.

Davey watches her go. Totally in love. Then leaps onto his
bed, drapes his comforter over his lap as --

HIS DOOR OPENS and his parents come in.

SHEILA
Honey? I thought I heard --

She sees her son, lap covered, disheveled, eyes wide.

SHEILA
OH! Oh my God. Oh -- I -- I should
have knocked --

DAVEY
Nonononono! It’s not --

RANDALL
Jesus, Davey. The bathroom at least
has a lock.

They retreat from his bedroom, shut the door --

DAVEY
(yelling out to them)
I wasn’t doing that!

He hurries to the window -- Down below, THERE’S NIKKI looking
up at him. She smiles, BLOWS HIM A KISS, heads off...

RANDALL (0.S.)(THROUGH DOOR)
Davey, I think it’s time you and I
had a little talk. When you're done.
41.

Off Davey’s mortified face we --
EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - BEVERLY FARMS, MA - NIGHT

A pall of fog hangs over the street as BOBBY COKER (15), a
pimply teen, exits the front door of a single story ranch
home. As the screen door closes, he looks back and waves --

BOBBY
Thanks again for everything, Mrs. S!

MOTHER (0.S.)
Anytime. Call when you get home so we
know you're safe, okay?

BOBBY'S FRIEND (0.S.)
Mom, he lives like four blocks away.

BOBBY
It's cool. I will. See ya.

Bobby heads down the front steps and down the sidewalk. As he
turns the corner and out of sight --

BOBBY'S FRIEND (0.S.)
Oh crap, he forgot his bag.

The screen door on the ranch home bursts back open and
BOBBY'S FRIEND (15) flies out, hustles to catch up. He
hurries around the corner to find --

BOBBY'S FRIEND
Bobby, you forgot your --

AN EMPTY SIDEWALK. Through the fog, he can just make out a
set of brake lights far down the block, as they turn and
disappear into the void...

INT. WOODY’S HOUSE - MORNING

The flicker of the TV illuminates the room, glinting off
empty cans and random refuse piled high on every surface.
It’s the home of a boy without parents. Unless you count --

BRENDA WOODWORTH (50s) lies passed out on the couch, still in
her nurse’s uniform. Makeup smeared across her face. Hair a
mess. The coffee table in front of her dotted with LITTLE
WHITE PILLS carelessly poured out beside a BOTTLE OF GIN.

Woody stands in the doorway looking at his parent. His
security. And he knows he’s on his own.
42.

He walks over, not needing to be stealthy. Digs a hand in her
purse. Comes out with her CAR KEYS. Gives Brenda one last
troubled look. Pulls a blanket over her, kisses her forehead.

WOODY
Love you, mom...

Then heads out. Brenda doesn’t even stir.
EXT. JUNIPER STREET - CUL-DE-SAC - DAY

Mackey, driving his POLICE CRUISER, rolls down the driveway.
Turns onto the street, passing --

DAVEY (0.S.)
Eight A.M. Right on time.

A PARKED STATION WAGON. The guys are inside, ducked down,
peeking through the windows. Woody, however, sits upright in
the driver’s seat, his troubled mind elsewhere --

FARRADAY (0.S.)
Get down, shit-for-brains!

Woody ducks just in time as Mackey’s car heads past, cruises
down the street and out of sight...

DAVEY
Woody, what’re you doing? You’re
gonna lose him already --

WOODY
Guys, I’m freaking out right now,
okay? I get caught driving my mom’s
car and I’m dead shit!

FARRADAY
You said she's sleeping off a 36-hour
shift. She's gonna be out for hours --

EATS
And you look like you’re thirty. It’s
gonna be fine, now drive!
EXT. CAPE ANN HARDWARE STORE - DOWNTOWN IPSWICH - DAY

Mackey, in uniform, strolls along the sidewalk -- Says
“Hello” to a PASSERBY as he enters the hardware store.

ACROSS THE STREET, the guys pull up in the station wagon,
ducked down but watching like hawks.
43.

DAVEY
Woody, what happened to you last
night? Thought you were coming over.

WOODY
Sorry. My mom... needed my help.

DAVEY
You'll never guess who showed up at
my door instead. At midnight. Nikki.

WOODY
No way! Really!?

FARRADAY
Yeah, okay, Davey.

EATS
Lemme speak in your language: There
isn’t even a parallel universe with
buttfucking Wookiees where Nikki came
over to your house last night.

DAVEY
I'm serious! She was about to kiss me
when my parents got home and --
(eyes going wide)
Guys, Mackey’s coming out!

Davey points ACROSS THE STREET to where Mackey exits the
hardware store...

EATS
We're picking up this convo later.

Eats’ brother Kyle is behind Mackey pushing a cart stacked
high with LARGE BAGS OF SOIL.

FARRADAY
Holy shit, that is a lot of dirt.

DAVEY
Just like Kyle said. How many bodies
you think that would bury?

Just then, another hardware store EMPLOYEE comes out pushing
another cart. On it are six LARGE, RED-STRIPED BAGS of some
sort of CHEMICAL, along with TWO SHOVELS and --

EATS
Is that a fuckin pick axe?

Yup. Kyle and the other employee pile the dirt and supplies
into the backseat and trunk of the police cruiser.
44,

DAVEY
We gotta keep following him, find out
what he’s doing with that stuff.

INT./EXT. STATION WAGON - DOWNTOWN IPSWICH - MOMENTS LATER

Approaching a busy intersection, Woody and the guys have
fallen a few cars behind Mackey.

EATS
You drive like my mom, dude -- You're
gonna lose him!

They're forced to stop at the red light and watch as Mackey
turns right on red. But the cars between them aren’t turning.
They just stop, boxing the boys in. Mackey's gone...

FARRADAY
Woody...! The hell, man!?

WOODY
All right, frig this! You guys are
dicks! I'm never doing this again!

DAVEY
Guys! Relax! Let’s just get home as
fast as we can and hope that's where
he's going too.

INT./EXT. STATION WAGON - MAIN ROAD - A SHORT TIME LATER

As the guys cruise along in silence, bad vibes in the air --
BWOOP-BWOOP! Woody looks into his rearview to find --

POLICE LIGHTS FLASHING! The guys turn to see a POLICE CRUISER
bearing down on them as Woody pulls his mom’s station wagon

to the side of the road.

WOODY
Oh shit! Fuck! I’m so screwed!

DAVEY
Is that Mackey!?

EATS
Woody, just be cool --

WOODY
I don’t have a license, genius!

EATS
Tell him you forgot it at home.
45.

DAVEY
What if it’s fuckin Mackey!?

The COP gets out of his cruiser. As he approaches, the guys
CAN’T SEE HIS FACE through the station wagon’s dirty windows.
GA-GLUNK -- GA-GLUNK -- DAVEY’S HEART POUNDS AS --

The cop TAPS on the window. Woody rolls it down revealing...
OFFICER COLE (40s), tall and serious, but definitely --

DAVEY
Not him... Thank God.

WOODY
Oh shit, Officer Cole...

OFFICER COLE
Goddammit, Dale. I thought that was
you. Does your mother know you stole
her car?

WOODY
I just borrowed it! We wanted snacks
and my mom was asleep --

OFFICER COLE
What if it wasn’t me that pulled ya
over? You could be in real trouble.

WOODY
I know, and I’m wicked sorry. I’1l
never do it again --

OFFICER COLE
Got me in a real bind here. Can’t
just bust ya cuz then how am I gonna
look your mother in the eye at church
on Sunday?

Officer Cole considers a moment. Looks inside the car at each
of the guys, all of whom are terrified... Except Eats.

OFFICER COLE
Mr. Eaton. What a surprise.

EATS
Officer Cole. We meet again.

OFFICER COLE
Look, guys, I get it. I took my Ma’s
car out for a joyride now and then
when I was your age. But times have
changed.

(MORE )
46.

OFFICER COLE (CONT’D)
Promise me you'll go straight home
and never do this again --

DAVEY
Excuse me, Officer?

Cole leans down, peers in at Davey to get a good look.

DAVEY
Do you know Officer Mackey?

The other boys shoot Davey a look of death: Shut up, dude!

OFFICER COLE
Town this small, everyone knows
everyone on the force. Why?

DAVEY
You like him? I mean, he a good guy?

OFFICER COLE

What’s this, twenty questions? Just
go home. Where it’s safe.

(lowers his voice)
Another kid's gone missing. Everyone
up at Town Hall's panicked. They're
even canceling the block party. It's
gonna be on the news any minute.

DAVEY
What!?

OFFICER COLE
Get your asses home. And stay there.

INT. DAVEY’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

ON THE TV, Sheriff Caldwell speaks at an emergency press
conference, addressing a crowd of REPORTERS. Behind Caldwell,
a LARGE PICTURE of a smiling BOBBY COKER sits on an easel.

SHERIFF CALDWELL (FROM TV)
The first 48 hours are vital. If
anyone has any information, please
call the hotline.

Both on the edges of their seats, Davey watches next to his
father as his WALKIE TALKIE SCREECHES TO LIFE --

RANDALL
Still can't believe this. Ya know
they canceled block party, too? It's
never been canceled before. What the
hell is happening to this town?
47.

FARRADAY (0.S.)(OVER WALKIE)
The eagle has landed! I repeat, the
eagle has landed!

Davey bolts up, sprints for the stairs and up into his --

RANDALL
Hey, clean your room while you’re up
there...! Ya hear me...?

INT. DAVEY’S HOUSE - DAVEY’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Davey shuts the door, grabs his binoculars and peers out the
picture window --

BINOCULARS POV: In Mackey’s driveway, the brakelights of
Mackey’s Wagoneer cast a creepy red glow over his yard.

Davey quickly scans the back of the Wagoneer where the bags
of soil should be... BUT THEY’RE NOT THERE.

DAVEY (INTO WALKIE)
Guys, the dirt’s not there.

FARRADAY (0.S.)(OVER WALKIE)
Maybe it’s still in his cruiser.

DAVEY (INTO WALKIE)
Why would he leave it in there?

WOODY (0.S.)(OVER WALKIE)
Or he stashes it someplace.

FARRADAY (0.S.)(OVER WALKIE)
Shit this guy’s good.

The brakelights fall dark. Mackey hops out. Enters his house.
Davey considers... WHISPERS to himself --

DAVEY
We’re on to you, Mackey...

CLICK... CLACK... What the...? Davey turns to the side window
as a PEBBLE RICOCHETS OFF. He goes over, looks out to find --

NIKKI. Gazing up at him. She waves for him to come out.

DAVEY
Best summer ever...
48.

EXT. NIKKI’S HOUSE - ROOFTOP - NIGHT

Pair of stolen beers between them, Davey sits next to Nikki,
listening expectantly. The moonlight is magical, it’s summer
and Davey’s in love, even though --

NIKKI
I thought everything was fine. Then
they just sat me down and told me
they don’t love each other anymore.
Like “that’s that.” They didn’t even
seem upset. So fucked up...

DAVEY
They still love you though. Nothing’s
gonna change that.

NIKKI
It’s like my life’s just been one big
lie. I feel like everyone’s gonna
judge me now. Like I can’t even talk
about it with anyone.

DAVEY
What about your friends?

NIKKI
Especially my friends. Their parents
are all still happily married.
Whatever that means.

Davey nods, unsure what to say in the face of such tragedy.
NIKKI
Honestly, I can’t wait to get out of
this stupid town, away from them.

Davey tries to hide the fact that he’s crushed. Until he sees
tears forming in her eyes.

NIKKI

Are your parents happy?
DAVEY

I dunno... I guess...
NIKKI

You must think I’m a loser, bringing
you out here for this.

DAVEY
No way. I love hanging out with you -
- I mean, ya know, as friends.
49.

Nikki looks at him. Realizing for the first time --

NIKKI
You really care about me, don’t you?

DAVEY
Well, yeah. I always have.

They hold each other’s gaze for a long moment. Then --

DAVEY
Can I tell you a secret...?

Nikki gives him an expectant look over her beer as she takes
a swig. He musters his courage...

DAVEY
I think Mackey’s the Cape Ann Killer.

Nikki nearly spits out her beer. Davey’s words seem to just
hang there in the air between them. Then Nikki CHUCKLES.

DAVEY
I’m not kidding.

NIKKI
Mr. Mackey? Davey, he’s friends with
my dad. He’s totally harmless.

DAVEY
That’s what he wants you to think.

NIKKI
I know how your mind works. But
you’re wrong.

DAVEY
This is different. We’ve been spying
on him and --

NIKKI
He’s a cop! If your mom and dad found
out you’re spying on him, they would
flip their shit.

DAVEY
I know. That’s why they’re not gonna.
Not until we have real evidence to
show them.

NIKKI
Davey, listen to me. You gotta stop.
50.

DAVEY
You’re just like everyone else...
NIKKI
No, look -- If you’re wrong, you'll
look like a lunatic and be in trouble
forever. And if you’re right... he

might catch you, or come after you.

DAVEY
I’m not gonna get caught.

NIKKI
Please, just let the police handle
the killer. I don’t want anything bad
to happen to you... You might just be
the only person left in this
neighborhood I actually care about.

INT. TREEHOUSE - NIGHT

The guys look through a few brand new porn mags, all
addressed to Mackey. This is Heaven.

WOODY
It’s the freakin mother lode.

EATS
Staking out Mackey was the best idea
you've ever had, Davey.

FARRADAY
Had a pretty good idea, myself --

Farraday pulls out a BOTTLE OF JACK DANIELS.

FARRADAY
Snagged it from my dad’s stash.

EATS
So you’re using those brainpowers for
good. About damn time. Gimme some --

They eagerly pass the bottle around and take swigs. One by
one, they cringe in disgust and GROAN. Farraday COUGHS --

FARRADAY
Oh, it’s bad. It’s so bad.

DAVEY
Tastes like my mouth is bleeding.

EATS
Guess you dickheads aren’t men yet.
51.

Eats keeps the Jack, clearly forcing it down with each tiny
sip as the other guys spit and swish sodas like mouthwash.

EATS
So let’s hear it, what's up with you
and Nikki?

DAVEY

We hung out again last night. She
says she likes talking to me. We
have, like, a connection.

EATS
Fuck you, a “connection.” Only
connection I want with her is
vaginal. Oral if she’s into it --

DAVEY
Don’t talk about her like that!

The guys all blankly stare at him -- Who are you? Davey
refocuses on Mackey’s house, miffed.

WOODY
Ya think she douches?

FARRADAY
Eww, Jesus, Woody!

WOODY
What? My mom does --

DAVEY
Guys, we need to stay focused.
Mackey’s still out there. We need
something solid.

Davey grabs the binoculars --

BINOCULARS POV: Davey scans the neighborhood, panning from
left to right...

FARRADAY
We’ve been on him for weeks. If he
was gonna give us a clue, we’d have
seen it by now, don’t ya think?

lands on THE HOFFMANS’ HOUSE. Lowers the binoculars.
DAVEY

Not if we missed it the first time.
Grab the flashlight.
52.

EXT. THE HOFFMAN HOUSE - NIGHT

The guys approach the front door. Everything dark inside.
Davey shines his DURABEAM FLASHLIGHT through the windows but
can't make out anything. He tries the doorknob --

ERRRRRK -- AND IT OPENS! The front door slowly sways wide,
revealing a pitch black house. Davey’s eyes light up.

FARRADAY
What. Everyone keeps their door
unlocked around here.

DAVEY
Yeah, but this was locked last
time... We gotta go in. What if
they're dead in there?

EATS
You said the killer kills kids, not
adults.

DAVEY

That’s not totally true. One of the
articles at the library said he
killed a whole family in Rockport.
Police said something must've gone
wrong. And if it's Mackey...

EATS
Fuck! That! You wanna go in there, be
my guest. Dumbasses first.
But Davey’s already on his way inside...

EATS
Davey, I was kidding! .... Davey!

As they hesitantly follow Davey inside --

WOODY
Guys, I got a bad feeling.

INT. THE HOFFMAN HOUSE - FOYER - MOMENTS LATER

Farraday and Woody hang onto each other as the guys creep
into the dark front room. Davey, flashlight leading the way,
finds the closest light switch. Flips it: nothing.

DAVEY
Light’s not working.

EATS
You guys smell that?
53.

WOODY
Yeah. Smells like... roadkill.

FARRADAY
If it's a bunch of dead bodies, I'm
totally gonna shit my Calvin Kleins.

Davey redirects the flashlight toward the room revealing --

THE PLACE IS A MESS. An overturned chair in the living room;
two open trash bags in the kitchen, flies swarming -- A CAT
eating among the refuse; mail and other debris on the floor
throughout. It looks like some shit went down!

DAVEY
Still think I'm crazy?
BRRRING -- The HOME TELEPHONE RINGS, scaring the hell out of
the boys.
FARRADAY
Goddamit!
EATS

Farraday, check your Calvins.

AS THE PHONE CONTINUES TO RING, Davey pushes ahead, moving
through the dark, nervous as hell, the boys huddled behind
him. Step by painstaking step...

Davey aims the flashlight into the kitchen.
DAVEY
Woody, try the kitchen light. It's
around the corner.

WOODY
Me!? Why me!?

DAVEY
Just do it! I'll shine the light.

Woody falters, but forces himself toward the now-illuminated
kitchen doorway, rounds it --

AND BUMPS INTO SOMEONE STANDING THERE HOLDING A KNIFE! Woody
falls backward onto the floor --

WOODY
AHHHH!

ALL OUR GUYS
AHHHHHHH!
54.

THE FIGURE FLIPS ON THE KITCHEN LIGHT revealing --

IT’S NIKKI. And it’s not a knife she’s got, it’s a
SCREWDRIVER. Thank Christ...

EATS
What the fuck, fuckers! Nearly had a
goddamn heart attack.

NIKKI
You guys scared the shit outta me!

WOODY
We scared you!?

DAVEY
What are you even doing here? With
the lights off?

NIKKI
A fuse blew while I was vacuuming
this mess. Stupid cats.

FARRADAY
Why’re you cleaning up after the
Hoffmans’ cats? And where’re the
Hoffmans?

NIKKI
They're at the lakehouse for the
summer. They pay me to make sure
Barnaby and Trixy don’t die. Easy
money. Usually...

The guys share a look of relief tinged with disappointment.
NIKKI

Wanna explain what the hell you guys
are doing in here?

DAVEY
Sammy’s been missing so we thought
maybe... the Hoffmans were dead.
NIKKI

And that it might’ve been Mackey...?
Seriously...?

Nikki CHUCKLES. Davey looks away, embarrassed.
EATS

You told her? Okay, what is going on
with you two? You hookin up?
55.

Davey gives him a piercing, horrified look. But Nikki smiles,
totally seeing what’s going on. She switches on the sexy.

NIKKI
Let’s just say he’s more of a man
than you jerkoffs.

She winks at Davey and heads off into the kitchen.

Davey’s eyes couldn’t be wider. He’s in shock. The other guys
LAUGH and HOLLER, proudly clapping him on the back.

EATS
Holy fucking shit. You’re my God.

JUST INSIDE THE KITCHEN, Nikki smiles wide, hearing it all...
INT. DAVEY’S HOUSE - DAVEY’S ROOM - DAY
Davey crashes into his room with a basket full of clothes --

SHEILA (0.S.)
and don’t forget to clean your
room! I mean it --

DAVEY
I know, Mom. God...

Knocks a FRAMED PHOTO off of his nightstand. Picks it up --
It’s a PHOTO of DAVEY (10) WITH HIS YOUNGER MOM AND DAD. He
places it back on the nightstand as he dumps the clothes onto
his bed. Looks around the room at the MESS. Ugh...

He opens his disaster of a closet, jams more junk inside. As
he's about to close it, his eyes fall on --

TWO WORN GAMBLES G.I. JOE WALKIE-TALKIES atop a crate of old
toys. Davey’s wheels start spinning. He grabs his regular
STARCODE WALKIE --

DAVEY (INTO WALKIE)
Guys, what time’re we playing Manhunt
tonight? I’ve got an idea...
EXT. MACKEY’S YARD - NIGHT
Dressed in black, the guys sprint through backyards, under
porches, over driveways, converging in the bushes along
Mackey’s house. They’re all out of breath, but exhilarated.

DAVEY
Arright, here’s the plan --

Davey pulls out the pair of old school G.I. Joe walkies.
56.

FARRADAY
Holy shit, you still have those?

DAVEY
While you guys are spying, I’m gonna
plant one of these outside Mackey’s
window. Use the other one to listen.

FARRADAY
Audio surveillance. Smart.

WOODY
Let’s just not get caught, okay?

DAVEY

Mackey spots you, act like it’s part
of the game. We probably got five
minutes til those little shits are up
our asses with flashlights, so let’s
be quick. Farraday, Woody, you guys
take ground level. Me and Eats are up
top. Operation Manhunt starts now.

They break. Eats follows Farraday. Woody follows Davey...

-- Farraday runs into the bushes along the driveway. His head
pops up to LOOK INTO THE KITCHEN WINDOW as --

-- Eats climbs a tree to get eyes on the UPSTAIRS BATHROOM.
Looks down at Farraday. Thumbs up. Then flips him off.

-- Woody sneaks along the house to THE DINING ROOM WINDOW.
Where Davey saw the missing boy weeks ago. Looks up at --

-- Davey scales the tree at the front corner of the house,
over the driveway. Finds a VIEW INTO MACKEY’S BEDROOM.

Gazing into the window, Davey makes sure Mackey’s not there.

Whips out the G.I. Joe walkie, some duct tape. Wraps the tape
around the walkie SO THAT THE TRANSMIT BUTTON IS PERMANENTLY

PRESSED DOWN (i.e. ALWAYS LISTENING).

Davey slides himself out along a thick branch that reaches
toward the bedroom window. Manages to PLACE IT ON THE
WINDOWSILL just outside the bedroom. CLICKS IT ON --

TOMMY (O.S.)
Found ya, ya big, bearded ball sack!

A BRIGHT LIGHT suddenly nails Woody below. He holds a hand to
his eyes, looks into TOMMY WARRENS’ (9) flashlight.

WOODY
Fuck off, Tommy! We got time out!
57.

TOMMY
No, ya don’t -- I caught you!

WOODY
Want me to beat the shit outta ya?
Cuz I will, ya little --
AHHH! Tommy runs off into the night, terrified. Just then --

EATS (0.S.)(OVER WALKIE)
I got eyes on him!

IN THE TREE AROUND THE HOUSE, Eats hugs the branches to hide
as THROUGH THE WINDOW, he sees --

MACKEY, YELLOW RUBBER GLOVES on both hands. He gathers
CLEANING SUPPLIES into a BUCKET. He seems perturbed.

EATS (INTO WALKIE)
He’s wearing rubber gloves! And he’s
got a bucket of cleaning shit.

DAVEY (0.S.)(OVER WALKIE)
Like, stuff to clean up blood?

Mackey heads out of the bathroom with his cleaning kit.

EATS (INTO WALKIE)
Guys, I lost him. He’s on the move.

IN THE BUSHES BELOW, Farraday sees Mackey enter the kitchen.

FARRADAY (INTO WALKIE)
Got him! He just came downstairs.

DAVEY (0.S.)(OVER WALKIE)
What’s in the bucket?

FARRADAY (INTO WALKIE)
Looks like bleach. And a scrubbing
brush. Can’t tell what the rest is.

What the...? Farraday spots a RED STAIN on Mackey’s shirt --

FARRADAY (INTO WALKIE)
Blood! He’s got blood on him!

DAVEY (0.S.)(OVER WALKIE)
Holy crap -- Are you sure?

FARRADAY (INTO WALKIE)
Well, maybe it’s paint? I don’t know.
It’s on his shirt -- Oh shit!
58.

FARRADAY DROPS into the bushes as MACKEY WALKS RIGHT PAST the
window. When Farraday sneaks a peek again... MACKEY’S GONE --

ON THE DRIVEWAY SIDE, Mackey comes into Woody’s view --

WOODY (INTO WALKIE)
I got him!

Woody watches, face as close to the glass as he can get
without fogging it up as Mackey pauses at the BASEMENT DOOR.
Checks his bucket. Pissed, he rushes down the steps...

WOODY (INTO WALKIE)
He went into the basement!

Woody bolts to the nearest basement window. Crouches down to
look in but IT’S BLACKED OUT. PAINTED ON THE INSIDE. He
rushes to the next window. Same. Next window... Same. Shit.

WOODY (INTO WALKIE)
Mackey’s M.I.A. All his basement
windows are painted over.

DAVEY DROPS TO THE GROUND, looks up at the bedroom window.
THE WALKIE IS HIDDEN by the sill except the tip of the
antenna. No way you’d see it. Unless you were looking for it.

Satisfied, Davey sneaks up to the nearest window. Raises
himself up to look inside just as --

MACKEY POPS INTO THE WINDOW! Slides it open to get fresh air,
not noticing Davey, until --

DAVEY PANICS! SCREAMS, sprints away, Woody right behind him!

From the far side of the house, Eats and Farraday sprint out
from the shadows following Davey and Woody.

Mackey stares out at them, concerned...

INT. DAVEY’S HOUSE - DAVEY’S ROOM - NIGHT

In bed but wide awake, Davey has the other G.I. JOE WALKIE on
his chest. He shakes it a few times, but nothing changes.
Total radio silence. He grabs his binoculars, looks out at --
BINOCULARS POV: Mackey's house. The tree beside it blocks
Davey’s view of the G.I. Joe walkie on the bedroom
windowsill. Damn.

DAVEY
The G.I. Joe walkie’s not working.
59.

He looks back at Woody who's lounging on the floor in his
sleeping bag, reading a comic by flashlight.

WOODY
Did ya test em first?

DAVEY
Yeah, the batteries are brand new.

WOODY
No, the distance. Remember? Those
things were junk, that’s why we
upgraded. They couldn’t transmit far.

DAVEY
Shit -- I forgot.

Woody hops up onto Davey's bed, grabs the binoculars and
gazes out toward Mackey's house.

WOODY
So what’re ya gonna do? Just say frig
it and leave it up there?

DAVEY
No way. Who knows what we could find
out. I gotta make it work.
EXT. JUNIPER STREET - CUL-DE-SAC - MORNING
Davey wheels down the sidewalk on his bike, chucking
newspapers onto porches. As he reaches Mackey’s driveway, he
slows to a stop. Waits -- No movement inside the house.

Coast seemingly clear, Davey drops his bike and newspaper
bag, hurries up the driveway...

At the side of the house, he reaches down and SWITCHES ON THE
G.I. JOE WALKIE clipped to his belt. NOTHING TRANSMITTING.

He goes to the tree below the window, gets ready to climb up
when he looks in the backyard and sees --

MACKEY, covered in sweat, dumping a big bag of dirt OVER A
HUMAN-SIZED MOUND IN THE GARDEN.

Davey freezes in disbelief as MACKEY LOOKS UP, SPOTS HIM --

MACKEY
Yo, Davey!

Davey strains to keep himself from bolting as Mackey claps
dirt off his hands, walks up to the fence. Leans on it.
60.

MACKEY
Hey, bud -- Gotta tell ya, you scared
the shit outta me last night. Had no
idea you were in my bushes. Great
hiding spot.

DAVEY
Yeah. Your yard’s full of em.

MACKEY
Guess you didn’t see me coming
either, huh? One hell of a scream.

Mackey LAUGHS. Davey fakes it. Fuckfuckfuckfuckfuck...

MACKEY
So what’s up? Oh -- Lemme guess, I
owe you money?

DAVEY
Uh, yeah.

MACKEY
Right. This time I’m ready for ya.

He pulls a $5 bill from his wallet. Holds it out to Davey.
Davey reluctantly walks toward him. AS HE NEARS THE HOUSE --

SCREECH! A HIGH-PITCHED SHRIEK fills the air -- WALKIE-TALKIE
FEEDBACK! Horrified, Davey scrambles to turn off the
screaming walkie on his belt. Finds the POWER SWITCH. Flicks
it off. Immediately, the FEEDBACK STOPS.

DAVEY
Sorry. Must’ve left it on. From the
game last night.

MACKEY
Mind if I have a look at it?

Davey cautiously hands the walkie over. Mackey gives it a
quick once over. Hands it back.

MACKEY
You know, if you ever want some real
walkies, I have a few retired ones
from the force just collecting dust
inside. Why don't ya come in and I'll
show ya. They pick up everything --

DAVEY
I can't. Right now. Gotta get back to
my route. But thanks for the payment.
61.

Davey swipes the $5 bill from Mackey’s hand. Hurries back to
his bike. As he loads up and pedals off, he looks back.
Mackey hasn’t moved. Gives Davey a parting wave.

INT. DAVEY’S HOUSE - DAVEY’S ROOM - NIGHT

Davey tries to read his Hardy Boys book, but it’s impossible.
He grabs the G.I. JOE WALKIE, paces with it, glaring at the
object that nearly got him caught. Unable to resist the urge
anymore, he grabs his binoculars --

BINOCULARS POV: Mackey’s house. The tree outside Mackey’s
bedroom window is still blocking the view of the sill. Davey
PANS ACROSS the house. Finally lands on --

MACKEY! STARING BACK THROUGH BINOCULARS OF HIS OWN FROM A
DIFFERENT WINDOW!

Davey dives out of sight, heart in his throat, shaking --

DAVEY
Shitshitshitshit...

Cautiously, he picks up the binoculars again, kneels at the
window. Gathering his courage, he looks out to find --

BINOCULARS POV: MACKEY’S GONE! And then Davey sees it -- ON
THE INSIDE SILL OF THE WINDOW WHERE MACKEY JUST STOOD...

THE OTHER G.I. JOE WALKIE, STILL WRAPPED IN DUCT TAPE!

He knows! Davey lowers the binoculars, hands shaking, face
frozen in horror -- DEEP BREATH... DEEP BREATH...

What the fuck do I do!? Davey paces. Grabs his walkie --

DAVEY (INTO WALKIE)
Guys! Guys! You copy? .... Come in!
(radio silence)
I’m freaking out! Woody, you there!?

Dead air. Davey chucks the walkie onto his bed. His eyes
canvas the room with purpose, landing on --

THE LOUISVILLE SLUGGER BASEBALL BAT leaning in the corner. He
grabs it. Pulls a chair to the window. Loops the binoculars
around his neck and props himself up on his elbows to keep an
overnight watch on Mackey's house. EYES WIDE, vigilant --

INT. DAVEY’S HOUSE - DAVEY’S ROOM - MORNING
BLINK... BLINK... Davey wakes. Still in the chair, still

holding the baseball bat. Realizes it's morning. Jolts up.
Wipes his eyes quickly, scanning the room. He’s alive.
62.

Purpose in his eyes, he checks his watch: 9:33am. Bolts to
his nightstand, grabs his walkie. Pulls his notebook out of
the top drawer. Flips through pages until he lands on --

“MACKEY'’S DAILY SCHEDULE” Eyes pouring over the details,
Davey hones in on one line -- “11PM: GOES FOR A JOG.”

DAVEY (INTO WALKIE)
Guys, we gotta talk. Treehouse in
twenty.

EXT. DOWNTOWN IPSWICH - NIGHT

MACKEY. Dressed in Larry Bird short-shorts, high socks,
sweatshirt and headband. Jogging, breathing hard. His face
coming in and out of shadow as streetlights pass by above.
He’s all alone, king of the abandoned late night streets.

DAVEY (V.0.)
The friggin walkie was sitting in his
window. He wanted me to see it.

FARRADAY (V.O.)
Oh my god. He's onto us. I should've
listened to my parents.

EATS (V.O.)
Your parents? Who listens to their
parents?

DAVEY (V.0.)

There's no way he knows why we're
spying on him, but even if he does,
he's not onto you, he's onto me.
Which is why I need you guys now more
than ever.

As Mackey keeps jogging, in the distance behind him, TWO
FIGURES on BMX BIKES pop out from behind bushes. Follow
safely behind Mackey, sticking to the shadows.

DAVEY (V.0.)
Mackey goes for a jog every night at
eleven. Farraday and Woody, you’re
gonna follow him tonight.

Farraday and Woody duck behind trees and lampposts for cover.
Keeping as quiet as possible as they track their quarry...

FARRADAY (V.O.)
Where are you and Eats gonna be?
63.

INT. TREEHOUSE - EARLIER THAT AFTERNOON

The guys are all in front of the whiteboard. A military
strategy session led by --

DAVEY
Yesterday on my route, I saw Mackey
dumping dirt over something in his
garden. Something the size of a body.

WOODY
I don’t like where this is going...

EXT. MACKEY’S HOUSE - BACKYARD - NIGHT

Davey and Eats rush up the driveway dressed in all black.
SHOVELS in hand. Barely visible under the moonlight.

DAVEY (V.0.)
While you two follow Mackey, we’re
gonna tear up his garden. See if we
can find that body. Or bodies...

They toss the shovels over the fence, vault it. Red rover,
red rover...

EATS (V.O.)
What if Mackey catches us?

DAVEY (V.0.)
Not gonna happen. If he starts
heading back, Woody and Farraday will
radio to let us know.

Davey plants a HANDHELD CB RADIO in the dirt. Turns it on,

keeps the VOLUME LOW. He and Eats dig in with the shovels...

INT. TREEHOUSE - EARLIER THAT AFTERNOON
The guys seem a little hesitant.

FARRADAY
Okay, but what about the garden? He’s
gonna notice it’s all dug up.

DAVEY
Raccoons. Just like with the garbage
in the street. They’re trying to get
food. What’s in a garden?

WOODY
Food!

Eats punches his shoulder. Idiot.
64.

DAVEY
We just wait for him to leave. Stay
in touch with our CBs the whole time.
It’s foolproof. Let’s pin the tail on
this donkey.

Off Davey’s grin, we --
EXT. SELF-STORAGE FACILITY - OUTSKIRTS OF IPSWICH - NIGHT

Panting, the sweat-stained Mackey runs up to your typical
outdoor self-storage facility. Rows and rows of units.

He takes a key out of his sock, opens the wide metal roll-up
door. Enters and lowers the door ALMOST TO THE GROUND...

FROM AROUND THE CORNER, Farraday and Woody watch on, their
bikes on the ground. But from their perspective, they can’t
see inside the storage unit.

FARRADAY
We’ve gotta get closer.

WOODY
How the hell’re we gonna do that
without him seeing us?

Woody turns back to find FARRADAY IS ALREADY GONE!

WOODY
Farraday! Goddammit...

SNEAKING ALONG THE UNITS, Woody catches up to Farraday who’s
moving as silently and quickly as possible.

They finally get to the edge of Mackey’s unit, hearts
pounding. Farraday looks at Woody. Puts a finger to his lips:
Don’t make a sound! Woody snarls back: No shit!

Farraday points to Woody’s eyes, then around the corner: Take
a look. Woody angrily mouths, Why me? Farraday: DO IT!

Annoyed and terrified, Woody leans down, peeks inside the
unit. HE CAN ONLY SEE ALONG THE GROUND. The roll up gate is
blocking everything higher than a foot tall.

ON THE FLOOR OF THE UNIT are a shitload of BAGS OF SOIL, four
or five SHOVELS, the PICKAX, and a stack of LARGE, STRIPED
BAGS labeled “NaOH.”

WOODY
(to himself)
“Noah"...?
65.

Next to the bags is A CAR, only its tires visible --
SCREECH! MACKEY PULLS UP THE UNIT DOOR --

The guys jump back into the shadows as Mackey hops into his
YELLOW VOLKSWAGEN BUG. The car engine PUTTERS to a start...

Mackey PULLS THE CAR OUT OF THE UNIT. Hops back out, SINGING:
MACKEY
“Every step you take... Every move
you make...”
Mackey closes the unit door after him. Locks it...
MACKEY
“Every word you say... Every game you
play, I’ll be watching you...”
jumps back into his VW Bug and ZIPS AWAY...

WOODY
Was he talking to us?

FARRADAY
What? No dude, that was The Police.

WOODY
You heard the police!?

FARRADAY
I pray for you sometimes...

Farraday and Woody sprint back to their bikes. As they race
away, Farraday YELLS into his HANDHELD CB RADIO --

FARRADAY (INTO CB RADIO)
Guys, Mackey just got into a yellow
Volkswagen Bug. We lost him.

EXT. MACKEY’S BACKYARD - GARDEN - CONTINUOUS

ON DAVEY’S CB RADIO, partially covered in dirt, VOLUME STILL
LOW. FARRADAY’S WORDS ARE BARELY AUDIBLE.

FARRADAY (0.S.)(OVER CB RADIO)
I repeat, we lost him. Do you copy?

TEN FEET AWAY, the oblivious Davey and Eats are still
excavating, soaked in sweat.

EATS
This is a lost cause. There’s nothing
here.
66.
DAVEY
We're just not digging deep enough.
Their heavy breathing fills the air...

EATS
You know Mackey had a shed back here?

Davey turns. Sure enough, deep in Mackey’s backyard,
naturally camouflaged by trees, IS A UTILITY SHED.

EXT. MACKEY’S BACKYARD - UTILITY SHED - MOMENTS LATER

Davey and Eats peek inside the windows with bulky Durabeam
flashlights, but the glare on the glass is blinding.

DAVEY
Can’t see anything.

On the shed door is a PADLOCK. Davey jiggles it. IT’S LOCKED.

EATS
I got this...

Eats reaches into his pocket. Pulls out a keychain. On it is
a PAPERCLIP. He unbends the paperclip, sticks it into the
padlock. Works it around skillfully for a moment --

CLICK -- The padlock releases. Eats nods arrogantly.

DAVEY
How the hell’d you do that?

EATS
I’m just good at working the hole.

Eats removes the lock. Opens the door.

DAVEY
Dude, I’m serious.

EATS
Honestly, just jiggle it a bunch,
work it around and it’1l pop open
most of the time. Wicked easy.

INT. UTILITY SHED - CONTINUOUS

The guys check every nook and cranny with their Durabeams:
tools, a lawn mower, a work bench... Usual shed stuff.

EATS
Well this whole night's been a waste
of time.
67.

But something catches Davey’s eyes. In the corner. He shines
his light on it... and his eyes go wide!

DAVEY
Until now.

Davey reaches out, grabs a SHREDDED GREEN TEE SHIRT that’s
fallen underneath a workbench. Recognize the LOGO on it?

EATS

It’s a shitty Atari shirt, so what?
DAVEY

So, this is Dusty Dewitt’s shirt!
EATS

Who...? .... Oh, the ginger.

Davey looks over the shirt, sees --

DAVEY
This is blood!

EATS
Fuck, dude. Heinous --

MALE VOICE (0.S.)
Hey, what are you doing in here!?

Davey and Eats nearly shit themselves as they spin to find --
FARRADAY AND WOODY, laughing their balls off.

EATS
You two got a death wish!?

FARRADAY
Us? What about you? We’ve been trying
to call you on the CB for like twenty
minutes.

DAVEY
Oh shit, we left it by the garden.

WOODY
Mackey has a storage unit outside
town. And he keeps a VW Bug in it. He
drove off and we lost him --

FARRADAY
We have no clue where he’s going.
68.

DAVEY
Then we better get the hell outta
here. Check out what we found...

As Davey shows the guys the bloodied Atari shirt, we --
INT. FARRADAY’S HOUSE - A SHORT TIME LATER

Eats picks through Farraday’s refrigerator while the other
guys chow down on PB&J sandwiches.

WOODY
Why’s he got all those bags of dirt
in the storage unit?

FARRADAY
Plus shovels and a pickax...?

DAVEY
Same reason he’s got Dusty Dewitt’s
shirt. He killed him and buried the
body somewhere.

Davey tosses the bloody, shredded shirt onto the counter.

FARRADAY
Dude...! My mom makes my mac n’
cheese right there...

Farraday grabs a pair of TONGS out of a drawer, picks up the
nasty shirt and rests it atop the trash.

WOODY
He also had a bunch of bags of...
something. They had chemical warning
signs on em, looked hazardous as
hell. “Noah,” that’s what it said.

EATS
“Noah”? What the hell’s that?

WOODY
How the hell should I know? But it
was spelled kinda weird.

Woody grabs a notepad and a pen. Jots down a few chemical
symbols and writes “NoAH." Slides it over to Farraday --

FARRADAY
Classic Woody. This look right?

Farraday crosses out “NoAH.” Writes down, “NaOH.”
69.

WOODY
Yeah. Same thing.

FARRADAY
No, what you wrote means nothing.
What I wrote is the chemical formula
for Sodium Hydroxide.

EATS
Congrats, Woody -- You’re retarded.

WOODY
Shove it, Eats.

DAVEY
What the hell’s sodium hydroxide?

FARRADAY
I know it isn’t useful in gardening.
Pretty sure it’d be toxic to plants.

Davey hurries to the bookcase full of ENCYCLOPEDIA
BRITANNICAs and scans them. Finds volume “Q-T.” Pulls it out,
flips through rapidly --

IN THE BOOK, Davey’s finger traces down the page landing on
“SODIUM HYDROXIDE." His eyes grow wider.

DAVEY
Holy shit, you guys!

As the guys gather around Davey, he reads aloud:

DAVEY
“Sodium Hydroxide breaks down the
chemical bonds that keep flesh
intact, turning organic tissue to
liquid. It's frequently used to
decompose roadkill dumped in
landfills, as it prevents the growth
of microorganisms, therefore
neutralizing and immobilizing acidic
components formed in the
decomposition process. This will
reduce the odor of decomposition.”

Eats, Farraday and Woody listen in stunned silence.
DAVEY
This sicko’s using this stuff to
cover up the smell from the dead
bodies he’s dumping someplace!

“Holy shit" looks all around.
70.

DAVEY
Got good news for ya, Woody. It’s
time to tell my parents.

INT. DAVEY’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Out of breath, Davey and the guys unload on Davey’s visibly
distraught parents. Dusty Dewitt’s frozen face stares back at
them from the EMPTY MILK CARTON that sits atop the coffee
table beside the shredded BLOODSTAINED ATARI TEE SHIRT.

DAVEY
Mackey’s the Cape Ann Killer!

SHEILA
David Aaron Armstrong! Lower your
voice. People outside might hear.

RANDALL
Mackey’s a cop for Chrissakes! He’s
also been our neighbor since before
you were born --

DAVEY
Every serial killer is somebody's
neighbor, Dad --

RANDALL
Regardless, a milk carton, a tee
shirt and a storage unit don’t prove
a goddamn thing!

SHEILA
How could you all go along with this?

EATS
We didn’t want to, trust me.

FARRADAY
We wouldn’t have if it didn’t make so
much sense.

WOODY
After we followed him to that storage
unit and saw --

SHEILA
Jesus, you’ve been spying on him!?

DAVEY
We had to! And the more we watch, the
more the details stack up. He goes
jogging at eleven at night. He buys
tons of dirt every week.

(MORE )
71.

DAVEY (CONT'D)
He keeps a spare car in a storage
unit. Why would he do that? There was
nothing in his garden when we dug it
up, but I’m positive that if --

RANDALL
You dug up his -- Goddammit, Davey!

Randall can’t sit anymore. He gets up and paces. Nervous.

RANDALL
You are in deep, deep trouble! All of
you! Vandalism, spying, stealing --
This is unacceptable!

DAVEY
We're trying to save people.

RANDALL
Worry about yourselves! We’re going
over there right now and you’re going
to apologize for all of this.

Randall grabs the milk carton. Rams it against Davey’s chest.

RANDALL
I’m putting an end to this nonsense
right now. You better hope he doesn’t
press charges.

EXT. JUNIPER STREET - CUL-DE-SAC - DAY

Randall marches across the cul-de-sac, the boys following
like dead men walking. WHISPERING to each other.

EATS
Fuck, Davey! You know how much shit
we're all gonna be in now?

FARRADAY
What’re we even gonna say to him?

WOODY
He’s probably gonna kill us --

DAVEY
Shut up!

Davey inconspicuously tucks the bloody shirt into his back
pocket as they reach --
72.

EXT. MACKEY’S HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS

Randall RINGS THE BELL. The guys all cower behind him as the
DOOR OPENS. Mackey freezes.

MACKEY
Randall. Guys. What’s up?
RANDALL
Hey, Wayne -- Uh, listen, the boys

have something they need to tell you,
and I wanna apologize in advance.
Just know that Sheila and I are as
outraged as you're about to be...

MACKEY
Jesus... Well I’m sure whatever it
is, we can make things right.

Randall and Mackey look back at Davey, waiting. Davey sweats
under the pressure of being this close to Mackey. He can’t
find the words. Randall nudges him.

DAVEY
Uh, hey, Mr. Mackey -- We just wanted
to say we’re sorry. We’re the ones
who ripped up your garden. And your
garbage.

MACKEY
Oh man, I just assumed it was
raccoons. Why’d you do that?

Davey hands Mackey the MILK CARTON. Mackey looks at it,
confused. Randall shakes his head, embarrassed.

DAVEY
A few weeks ago, I thought I saw that
boy in your house. We were playing
Manhunt and I was hiding in your
bushes and...

RANDALL
And...? Come on, out with it.

Davey looks to his buddies for support, but their looks
suggest he’s on his own. You got us into this...

DAVEY
I had this idea that you were,
maybe... the Cape Ann Killer.

Mackey stares at him a long, tense moment. The guys all ready
to run like hell. But then... Mackey LAUGHS.
73.

MACKEY
The guys at the station are gonna
roar when they hear this!

Randall smiles, relieved. The guys all chuckle a bit,
uncomfortable and unsure where this is going. Even Davey
gives an embarrassed smile, though it doesn’t reach his eyes.

DAVEY
So, who was the kid that was here?

MACKEY
That was my nephew, Jamie. He was
helping me renovate my darkroom.

DAVEY
Thought ya didn’t have family nearby?
And we found this in your shed --

Davey hands the Atari shirt from his back pocket to Mackey --

RANDALL
David!?

MACKEY
You broke into my shed, too?

Randall's blood boils, utterly embarrassed, as Mackey
inspects the shirt. Sees the blood immediately.

RANDALL
Wayne, I’m so sorry. You don’t need
to respond to that --

MACKEY
It's fine. We were hammering nails
all day. He must’ve cut himself.
Look, I can call him right now. Come
on in, let’s just settle this --

RANDALL
No, no. That’s not necessary. We just
wanted you to know what happened and
that the guys promise to fix anything
they damaged, no matter how long it
takes. Right?

THE GUYS
Yes, sir.

MACKEY
Well, I appreciate the apology. No
hard feelings, honestly.

(MORE )
MACKEY (CONT'D)
I remember being a boy in the summer.
Hard to turn down an adventure.

RANDALL
You're a better man than me, Wayne.

74.

Randall grabs Davey and pulls him away. The guys follow...

EXT. DAVEY’S HOUSE - FRONT PORCH - CONTINUOUS

The guys try to avoid Randall’s seething gaze as he opens the

front door...

RANDALL
Tell your friends goodbye, then get
in your room and don’t come out. The
rest of you, go home. We’1l be
calling your parents.

and heads inside -- WHAM! -- SLAMS the door.

EATS
Well, that was a fucking disaster.

DAVEY
This doesn't change anything.

FARRADAY
Seriously? Davey, come on. I mean, is
it possible he’s the killer? Maybe.
But odds are still that it’s not him.

EATS
Your summer’s fucked, but we may get
outta this with just garden duty. I’m
not risking what little of the good
life I got left...

WOODY
Spying on him was cool, but let’s
just move on already.

DAVEY
You guys, we just need a couple more
pieces of real evidence --

EATS
Give it up, dude! I’m outta here.
Call me when you get a life...

Eats crosses to his own yard without looking back. Davey

looks imploringly at Farraday.
75.

FARRADAY
I wanted to believe it too. But
what’s more likely? That we got
caught up in the moment, or that a
cop we’ve known all our lives is a
serial killer?

Farraday claps Davey on the shoulder, heads home.

WOODY
Sorry, Davey. I’11 radio you tonight.

Woody walks off, leaving Davey alone on the porch. Davey
glares across the street to Mackey’s, enraged.

INT. DAVEY’S HOUSE - DAVEY’S ROOM - NIGHT

A PAPERCLIP jiggles in the keyhole of a PADLOCK. Davey bites
his lip in concentration. Nothing. Jiggles some more. Then --

CLICK! The lock opens. Davey smiles as --

DAVEY
Holy shit, it worked...

BRRRING! The house phone RINGS. Davey bolts off his bed, runs
into the hallway and answers --

DAVEY
Hello...?

NIKKI (0.S.)(OVER PHONE)
Can you come over?

INT. NIKKI’S HOUSE - NIKKI’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Davey looks around, enthralled. HE’S IN A GIRL’S BEDROOM! And
not just any girl’s room -- NIKKI FUCKIN KASZUBA’S!

Half-packed CARDBOARD BOXES fill the room. It’s a mess. Nikki
sits on the bed in the eye of the storm as Davey takes it in.

NIKKI
Did I get you in trouble for calling
so late? I was hoping your mom
wouldn’t pick up.

DAVEY
Nah, they’re downtown at a meeting
about how to handle the block party
situation. Looks like you’re the one
who could use some help, though.

Nikki hands him something --
76.
NIKKI
Hey, check out what I found...

Hands him a WORN PHOTO of the two of them together, back when
she had braces and he was still in grade school.

NIKKI
It’s coming with me.
DAVEY
To UConn? Really?
NIKKI
Yeah... It’s going up on my wall.

Davey swells with pride as an overwhelmed Nikki drinks in her
barely-recognizable room...

NIKKI
God, feels like I’m packing up my
whole life. I didn’t think I’d miss
this place, but now... I can’t deal.

Out of his depth, Davey sinks down to the bed beside her.

DAVEY
Seriously? Aren’t you the one who
says this town’s lame?

NIKKI
I don’t know what I feel anymore.
Everyone keeps talking to me like I’m
already gone and it’s wigging me out.

DAVEY
It’s probably just cuz everyone’s
gonna miss you. I know I will.

NIKKI
Wish my parents felt that way.
They’re so wrapped up in the divorce,
they don’t even care that I’m gonna
be gone. I just feel so... alone.

DAVEY
You’re not alone.

He puts a supportive hand on her arm. There’s a smooth
confidence to him that’s charming. Nikki can’t help smiling.

NIKKI
You're sweet. Hope the students at
uConn like me half as much as you.
77.

DAVEY
They will. You’re destined for way
more than living in this stupid
neighborhood forever. I'd give
anything to get outta here with you.

Nikki reads Davey’s conflicted face like a National Enquirer.

NIKKI
Okay, spill.
(Davey feigns ignorance)
I remember that look. Used to see it
all the time. You're in trouble, huh?

Davey considers... Finally comes out with it --

DAVEY
I’m grounded, big time. My parents
are pissed. My Dad made me admit the
whole thing to Mackey --

NIKKI
What!? No he didn’t!

DAVEY
The guys bailed on me. Worst part is
I know I’m right about him. Just
don’t know what else I can do.

Nikki takes his hand. He meets her concerned gaze.
NIKKI
Let it go. You only get the chance to
be a kid once. Enjoy your life while
you can. Trust me.

DAVEY
If I’m right, who’s gonna stop him?

INT. DAVEY’S HOUSE - DAY
ON THE FRONT DOOR -- KNOCK! KNOCK!
WE HEAR FOOTSTEPS DESCENDING THE STAIRS, revealing --

Davey. He fixes his hair in the mirror beside the door,
clearly hoping it’s Nikki. He opens the door to find --

MACKEY. In his police uniform. Oh shit! Davey immediately
stands straighter. Glances at the GUN in Mackey’s holster.

MACKEY
Hey, Davey. What’s goin on?
Davey just

His choice

78.

DAVEY
What’re you doing here?

MACKEY
I wanted to make sure we’re good. I
feel pretty bad about everything that
happened yesterday.

stares back at him, unsettled.
MACKEY

Mind if I come in for a second so we
can talk?

DAVEY
Now’s not a good time.
MACKEY
Cool. I get that... You know we’ve

got everyone out looking for this
sicko, right?

DAVEY
Then why haven’t you found him yet?

MACKEY
These things take time. Sometimes
years. If ya want, I can stop by and
give you updates.

DAVEY
You don’t have to do that. I see the
paper before anyone, remember?

MACKEY
You sure? It’d be my pleasure. I know
this stuff interests you.

DAVEY
Was there anything else, Mr. Mackey?

MACKEY
Wow, you really don’t like me, huh?
That really bums me out, Davey. Last
thing I want is for there to be bad
blood between us.

of words sober Davey. He pauses... Softens...

DAVEY
Yeah, me too. It’s just my summer’s
basically destroyed now because of
the whole garden thing. Pretty sure
my parents hate me.
79.

MACKEY
Want me to talk to them? See if I can
lighten the sentence? Happy to.

DAVEY
It’s all right. Thanks though.

MACKEY
I just keep wondering what I did that
made you so suspicious of me...

DAVEY
I dunno. My dad says I read too many
mysteries. With the Killer on the
loose, I just got caught up in it.

MACKEY
Hey, I get it. That’s why I became a
cop. It’s exciting what’s going on,
and you wanna help. That’s awesome.
I’1l admit, the stuff you thought was
proof looked pretty bad out of
context. You’ve got the brain for
this kinda work.

Davey smiles. Finally lets down his guard.

MACKEY
Anything I can do to smooth things
over once and for all?

DAVEY
Yesterday you offered to call your
nephew. Wanna maybe call him now?

MACKEY
Yeah, absolutely. Kinda gotta come in
to do that though.

DAVEY
Actually, our cord’s wicked long.
Wait here a sec --
Davey hurries off into the --

KITCHEN. Back against the cupboards, Davey’s freaking the fuck
out. He slowly sneaks a peek around the corner to find --

Mackey’s taken one step into the house. Standing there
looking as awkward as anyone would in this scenario.

Davey leans back into the kitchen. Takes a few DEEP BREATHS.
Spots the WOODBLOCK FULL OF KNIVES.
80.

Plucks out the BUTCHER KNIFE and slides it carefully down the
back of his pants. Picks the kitchen phone off the jack,
heads back into the --

LIVING ROOM. Hands Mackey the phone, cord dangling off into
the kitchen. Mackey points into the living room.

MACKEY
Place looks great. Haven’t been here
since -- Man, you were probably a

toddler. I helped your dad haul a
bunch of stuff into your attic.

DAVEY
Weird how times change, huh?

Mackey DIALS. Puts the phone to his ear --

MACKEY
My sister lives in New Hampshire.
(checks his watch)
Hmm, they might not be home. Jamie’s
big into baseball. Usually has
practice around now, I think.

He listens for a few more moments. Shakes his head. Holds out
the phone so Davey can hear the RINGING.

MACKEY
I can come back if you want? Try him
again later...?

DAVEY
No, it’s fine -- I’m sorry for being
such an idiot. I promise we’ll fix
your garden even better than it was.

Mackey hands the phone back. Offers his hand to Davey.

MACKEY
No hard feelings?

Davey’s hand trembles slightly as he takes it.

MACKEY
Sorry again you’re grounded. I’1l see
what I can do about getting you out
of the house, all right?

Mackey heads off down Davey’s driveway and Davey shuts the
door behind him. LOCKS IT. Peeks out to make sure Mackey’s
leaving. Bolts --
81.

BACK INTO THE KITCHEN. Rushes to the whiteboard on the
fridge. Grabs the MARKER and DIALS “0” on the PHONE.

OPERATOR (0.S.)(OVER PHONE)
Operator. How may I direct your call?

DAVEY (INTO PHONE)
Can you tell me the last number
dialed from my house?

OPERATOR (0.S.)(OVER PHONE)
The last number dialed from that
residence was 508-356-0742.

Davey writes the number on the whiteboard. HANGS UP, eyes
wide. He quickly scans the list of EMERGENCY NUMBERS beside
the whiteboard, finds what he's looking for --

IT'S MACKEY'S PHONE NUMBER!
INT. DAVEY’S HOUSE - DAVEY’S ROOM - LATER

The guys are all here. Davey looks between them for some kind
of reaction, other than disinterest.

DAVEY
How are you not freaking out right
now!? He called himself! There is no
Jamie! He tried to throw me off and I
caught him. This proves he's guilty!
We gotta get into that house to find
out what’s in that basement --

FARRADAY
Are you crazy? Look how much trouble
you're in just for digging up his
garden --

SHEILA (0.S.)
Davey! Get down here!

DAVEY
Shit. Wait here. Don’t make a sound.

He grabs his walkie. Clips it to his belt.

DAVEY
If I think my mom knows you’re up
here, I’1l radio so you can climb out
the window.
82.

INT. DAVEY’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Davey jumps down the stairs to find his mother Sheila
standing before the television once more.

SHEILA
I want you to see this.

ON THE TV is a LIVE PRESS CONFERENCE. Sheriff Caldwell is at
a podium filled with microphones.

SHERIFF CALDWELL (FROM TV)
-- happy to report that we have the
Cape Ann Killer in custody.

A MUGSHOT of an average WHITE GUY (40s) pops onto the screen.
Beneath the photo: “JAMES VIGNERON - ‘THE CAPE ANN KILLER’”.

Davey’s jaw drops in disbelief as the PHONE RINGS. Sheila
goes to answer it in the kitchen as Davey subtly reaches for
his walkie. Holds down the TRANSMIT BUTTON --

INSERT

The three guys are mid whisper argument when the WALKIE in
Woody’s hand suddenly comes to life. They shut up --

SHERIFF CALDWELL (0.S.)(OVER WALKIE)
Thanks to the fine effort of the
Ipswich Police Department, we
apprehended Mr. Vigneron earlier
today. I’d like to bring up the
arresting officer, Wayne Mackey.

EATS
Holy fucking shit!

BACK TO SCENE

Davey watches on in stunned silence as Sheila talks on the
phone, hidden from view in the kitchen.

MACKEY (FROM TV) SHEILA (0.S.)
I know this has been a trying No, I think it's perfect!
time for our community. But +... In poor taste? No, this
we hope this announcement is just what everyone needs
will bring peace to those who to help lift their spirits.
have been living in fear. +... Ok, be there in a few.

Mackey looks at the camera, as though seeing Davey through
the airwaves. Davey stares back, unflinching.

MACKEY (FROM TV)
Justice will be served. Thank you.
83.

Mackey waves and steps down as the CROWD APPLAUDS and Sheila
returns to stand at Davey's side.

SHEILA
The block party's back on. And all
because of Mr. Mackey. While the rest
of us are celebrating, I want you to
think about your actions. Because it
turns out the man across the street
isn't a killer, David, he's a hero.

EXT. DAVEY’S HOUSE - DAVEY’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
A frustrated Davey stands before his incredulous buddies.

DAVEY
He’s not a hero! Did you guys not
just hear that broadcast? Now we know
he’s guilty!

EATS
Are you retarded? He caught the
killer! It can’t be him!

DAVEY
Don’t you think it’s a little
coincidental that the guy we just
accused of being the killer just so
happens to then catch the killer?
Farraday, you said it yourself --
Cape Ann’s wicked big, right?

Farraday shrugs: Yeah, I guess...

DAVEY

This is exactly what we talked about
-- He’s a cop, it’s the perfect
cover. He can plant evidence to make
someone else look guilty! If Mackey’s
got these bodies, all he’d have to do
is plant one in someone’s yard. Boom
-- They’ve got a suspect.

EATS
Dude, you just sound desperate now.
Just admit you were wrong and --

DAVEY
I’m not wrong! I know there’s
something behind that locked door! We
have to find out what before some
innocent guy takes the rap for Mackey
and more people die!
84.

FARRADAY
Even if you got in, how are you gonna
get any evidence out? Can’t just drag
a body out of a basement.

DAVEY
I don’t have to. I’m gonna use my
dad's camcorder, film it all. No need
to steal evidence if I get it on
tape. Tape doesn’t lie.

Davey can see clearly the doubt etched on their faces.

DAVEY
I just need you guys to keep watch,
and make sure Mackey doesn’t come
home while I’m in there.

EATS
No, I’m done with this shit. You’re
gonna get caught, either by Mackey or
your dad --

DAVEY
Everyone’s gonna be at the block
party. All I need you to do is set up
at the bus shelter down the street.
Bring booze and pornos, whatever.
Just radio me if Mackey’s car comes
up. And Farraday --

FARRADAY
You know my parents make me go to the
block party every year --

DAVEY
I’m counting on it. You can keep eyes
on Mackey there. He leaves early, you
give me the heads-up. We’1ll have
multiple layers of protection. No way
we get caught.

WOODY
“We”?

DAVEY
You’re coming with me. I’11l owe you.

The guys consider for a few moments. Then, finally --
WOODY

If it means we're gonna finish
this... I guess I'm in.
85.

FARRADAY
Yeah... me too. One last shot.

EATS
Whatever, fine. But if anyone asks,
I’m pinning the whole thing on you.

Davey smiles.

DAVEY
Mackey’s crazy if he thinks he can do
this shit on our block and get away
with it. Time to make him pay.

EXT. JUNIPER STREET - CUL-DE-SAC - DUSK

In the fading light, NEIGHBORHOOD FAMILIES walk together
toward the DISTANT DIN of the downtown summer block party.

Among them, Farraday strolls with his parents, HANDHELD CB
RADIO clipped to his pants. He looks back at --

INT. DAVEY’S HOUSE - ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS

Looking totally bummed out, Davey’s slumped in a chair by the
TV as his parents open the front door to leave.

DAVEY
This is so not fair!

RANDALL
David, a punishment’s a punishment.
If you really gave a damn about going
to the block party, you wouldn’t have
acted like a lunatic all summer --

DAVEY
Just lemme go and I’11 be grounded
again after --

RANDALL
Not happening! End of story!

Randall heads out with Sheila. Once the door is shut --
Davey’s all business. He sprints up to his room, over to the
picture window. WATCHES the beehive of activity as his
parents join the other neighbors heading to the block party.
FROM HIS DRIVEWAY, Mackey pulls out in his SQUAD CAR. Gives a
friendly BWOOP-BWOOP and flashes the lights for the CHEERING
NEIGHBORS as he rides past...

Davey grabs the HANDHELD CB RADIO off the shelf --
86.
DAVEY (INTO CB)
Guys, it’s “go” time!
EXT. DOWNTOWN IPSWICH - MAIN STRIP - DUSK

A BANNER hangs over the quaint downtown -- “75TH ANNUAL
IPSWICH SUMMER BLOCK PARTY.”

Below the banner, a bustling CROWD enjoys fried dough,
strawberry shortcake and beer as a BEATLES COVER BAND plays
“MAXWELL SILVER HAMMER” from a makeshift stage.
IN THE CROWD, Farraday hangs back from his parents, eyes on --
MACKEY, dressed in his police uniform. He’s beside a few
other OFFICERS, laughing, greeting the swarming citizens who
thank him for catching the killer. A bonafide local hero.
Farraday pulls out his CB radio --
FARRADAY (INTO CB)
Got eyes on Mackey. You guys are good
to go. Over...

DAVEY (0.S.)(OVER CB)
Roger that. We’re moving.

INT. EATS’ HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Lounging on his couch, Eats watches WHEEL OF FORTUNE with
Kyle as ON TV, PAT SAJAK describes the usual prize package --

CRASH! Glass SHATTERS against a wall in another room --

MALE VOICE (0.S.)
You goddamn bitch!

FEMALE VOICE (0.S.)
Fuck you, Mark -- Asshole!

MALE VOICE (0.S.)
Janice! Hey! I’m talking to you!

From the kitchen, their mother, JANICE (40s), darts into the
living room, seething hatred on her face. She grabs her car
keys off the coffee table --

Eats watches on, clearly upset. Kyle on the other hand keeps
watching TV, like he’s seen this a million times.

Janice heads for the front door, exits, as their father, MARK
(40s), bolts out after her --
87.

MARK
Where the hell you think you’re
going? Janice! Get back here --

WHAM! The front door slams after them, Pat Sajak’s nasally
voice filling the uncomfortable silence.

PAT SAJAK (FROM TV)
R, S, T, L, N, E --

DAVEY (0.S.)(OVER CB)
Eats! Eats! You in position?

Eats grabs his HANDHELD CB off the couch beside him --

KYLE
Shut the fuck up. Wheel is on.

Eats sullenly hops off the couch, grabs his backpack and
heads out the back door.

EATS (INTO CB)
Hey Dickholes, chill. I’m going now.

EXT. JUNIPER STREET - CUL-DE-SAC - NIGHT

Under cover of dark, Davey and Woody hurry to Randall’s NEWS
VAN. Davey opens the trunk, pulls out the BETAMAX CAMCORDER --—

DAVEY
Hold this.

He hands the camcorder to Woody, grabs a BATTERY PACK, an
EXTRA TAPE. Stuffs them in his backpack. And they bolt toward
Mackey's house, into his sideyard...

UNKNOWN POV: From across the street, we watch Davey and Woody
race around the side of Mackey's house toward --

EXT. MACKEY’S HOUSE - BACKYARD - MOMENTS LATER

In the pitch black, Davey holds the camcorder at his side
while Woody removes a screen window. Places it on the ground.

WOODY
I’1l give ya ten fingers.

Woody squats down, interlocking his fingers. Davey wedges his
foot in Woody’s hands for a boost up and into --

INT. MACKEY’S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Feet on the floor, Davey gets his bearings as Woody replaces
the screen window from outside.
88.
WOODY
Kay, now let me in.
Davey unlocks the back porch door. Woody enters, camcorder in
hand. The guys check out the place. There’s an unnatural

stillness to it. Undeniably creepy.

DAVEY
He’s definitely killed kids in here.

WOODY
Why would you say that right now?

Davey spots the basement door down the hall.

DAVEY
Cuz it’s true.

UNKNOWN VOICE (0.S.)
Let's find out.

AHHHHHHHHH! Davey and Woody spin to find --
NIKKI. Standing in the back porch doorway.

WOODY
What is it with you scaring us!?

DAVEY
What're you doing here?

NIKKI
After everything you've told me, I
wanna see for myself.

DAVEY
Thought you said I should let it go.

NIKKI
Yeah, well, if you're right, who else
is gonna stop him?

She gives him a knowing wink.

EXT. DOWNTOWN IPSWICH - MAIN STRIP - CONTINUOUS

Farraday chows some fried dough beside his mom and dad who're
inexplicably enthralled by the cheesy Beatles cover band as
FLASHING LIGHTS CAPTURE HIS ATTENTION --

NEARBY, a CROWD has gathered, blocking whatever they’re

looking at from Farraday’s view. The flashing lights are from
cameras as REPORTERS capture the moment for the local papers.
89.
Farraday moves closer to get a better view. As he splits
through the crowd, he sees --
MACKEY and five other POLICE OFFICERS, SHOVELS IN HAND,
camera-ready, gathered along a brand-new median strip. In the
strip are beautiful flowers, COVERED IN FRESH SOIL. A PICKAX
leans against the centerpiece of the strip, a TREE.

A SIGN sticking out of the dirt reads, “DOWNTOWN
BEAUTIFICATION PROJECT - SPONSORED BY THE IPSWICH P.D.”

Farraday nearly shits himself, face turning white as a ghost.
INT. MACKEY’S HOUSE - BASEMENT STAIRS - CONTINUOUS

At the basement door, Davey stares at the knob. Trying to
build up his courage. Woody and Nikki wait behind him.

WOODY
We don’t have to go down there...
CLICK -- Davey turns the doorknob, slowly opens the door.
DAVEY
I do.

Woody GULPS. TURNS ON THE CAMCORDER as Davey flicks the light
switch. NOTHING HAPPENS. The stairs remain pitch black.

WOODY
Oh come on --

SQUAWK! The guys and Nikki nearly jump out of their skin --

FARRADAY (0.S.)(OVER CB)
Davey! Davey, you copy!?

Realize it’s just the CB.

DAVEY (INTO CB)
Is he on his way back!?

INTERCUT WITH:
EXT. DOWNTOWN IPSWICH - MAIN STRIP - CONTINUOUS

In an alley, away from the crowd, Farraday spies the
beautification ceremony from afar, CB to his lips.

FARRADAY (INTO CB)
Way worse. You’re wrong about
everything. The dirt and shovels were
for a project Mackey was doing with
the police department.

(MORE )
90.

FARRADAY (INTO CB) (CONT'D)
They planted a shitload of flowers
down here.

DAVEY (INTO CB)
That doesn’t prove anything.

FARRADAY (INTO CB)
Listen to me -- It’s over. You’ve
gotta learn when to walk away. School
starts in a week and I only made it
through half of what I was supposed
to. My parents are up my ass. I gotta
focus. I’m out, Davey.

DAVEY (INTO CB)
Farraday, wait --

CLICK. Farraday shuts off his CB, joins the fun.
WOODY
Maybe he’s right. Maybe we should
just go. This is crazy. We just broke
into a friggin cop’s house!
NIKKI
We're already here. May as well take
a look. If it's not him --
DAVEY
It’s him. And we’re about to find the
proof.
Davey takes his first step down into the darkness --
INT. JUNIPER STREET - SCHOOL BUS SHELTER - CONTINUOUS

Massive Cariole headphones over his ears, Eats sits on the
shelter bench, tears in his eyes, listening to a punk song --

HEADLIGHTS wash over him and he perks up, freaked out. Wipes
his tears. Is it Mackey!? Grabs his CB RADIO...

but the car rolls past. Relief.
INT. MACKEY’S HOUSE - BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

As they make their way down the basement steps, scared
shitless, the pitch blackness blends with a BLOOD RED GLOW.

NIKKI
Tell me you brought a flashlight.

DAVEY
The camcorder's got a light.
91.

WOODY

This thing has a light and you’re

just telling me now!?
Davey reaches over, clicks the camcorder’s light switch --
ITS BEAM PIERCES THROUGH THE CRIMSON DARK, bright, focused,
but THE PERIPHERY IS ABSOLUTE BLACK. TUNNEL VISION.
Woody uses the light to scan the area. TO THEIR LEFT is
Mackey’s dark room, red light emanating from within. TO THEIR
RIGHT, a washer and dryer. EVERY WINDOW IS PAINTED BLACK.

NIKKI
Creepiest basement ever --

WHACK! Woody hits his head on A DANGLING LIGHTBULB --

WOODY
Jesus, fuck!

DAVEY
It’s just a light!

Davey reaches up, pulls the chain -- POP! They jump back as
the bulb BURNS OUT, SHATTERING IN A BLINDING FLASH.

WOODY
I can’t see! I can’t see --

DAVEY
Calm down. Just follow me.

Woody puts his hand on Davey’s shoulder as they move to --

THE PADLOCKED DOOR in the corner that captured Davey’s
attention from the moment he saw it --

KACHUNK! Woody SCREAMS, whips the camcorder around to find --
THE LARGE FURNACE, its metal GROANING.

NIKKI
Woody! Chill out, you girl!

WOODY
I’m not built for this shit.

Davey moves to the door. Pulls a PAPERCLIP out of his pocket.

DAVEY
Shine the light right on the lock.

Woody brings the light over. Davey straightens the paperclip.
Sticks it into the keyhole. Jiggles it around --
92.

WOODY
Seriously? Did Eats teach you that?
Because it doesn’t work --
CLICK! THE PADLOCK RELEASES.
INT. JUNIPER STREET - SCHOOL BUS SHELTER - SAME

Eats hasn’t moved, still desolate, off in another world --

SCREECH! Eats’ eyes burst open -- What the fuck was that!? He
RIPS OFF HIS HEADPHONES, looks around, listens intently...

THE ONLY SOUND IS THE TINNY MUSIC COMING FROM HIS HEADPHONES.

A SUMMER BREEZE COURSES through the trees, questionable
sounds all around. And then --

DEAFENING SILENCE envelops the area. Until --

MALE VOICE (0.S.)
VAGINA!

AHHH! Eats jumps back, petrified, to find --
FARRADAY, laughing his ass off.

EATS
You’re such a friggin dick!

Eats gets up to pummel Farraday. Puts him in a headlock as --

EATS
Why’re you even here? You’re supposed
to be watching Mackey.

FARRADAY
My mom and dad wanted to leave. I ran
ahead to fuck with you. I’m sorry.
You can go home. Whole thing’s off.

EATS
What do you mean? Davey’s still in
Mackey’s house --
MR. AND MRS. FARRADAY approach -- EH-EHM!
CURTIS SR.
Thomas. What on Earth are you doing
at the school bus shelter this late?

Eats releases his death grip. Straightens Farraday’s clothes.
93.

EATS
Oh, I was just showing Curtis here a
few Karate Kid moves I’ve been
practicing. Wax on, wax off...

They don’t get the reference. Academic types. Awkward.

EATS
Hey, mind if I sleep over tonight? My
parents are fighting again.

FRANCINE
Of course. Poor thing. They have no
idea the damage they're doing to you.

CURTIS SR.
But Curtis, no fun until your
reading’s done. Understood?

Farraday nods, annoyed, as his parents head off...

FARRADAY
How bad is it this time?

EATS
Let’s just say I don’t wanna witness
a murder-suicide...

Eats grabs the handheld CB. TURNS IT OFF --

INT. MACKEY’S HOUSE - MAKESHIFT BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

We finally get a good look at the place as Woody moves the
light around. It’s a bedroom. A teenage boys’ room. Sports

posters on the wall. A twin bed. Vintage radio on a dresser.

NIKKI
What is this place?

Davey touches the frayed ear of a stuffed bunny that sits in
a heap of old stuffed animals on a rocking chair. He lifts
the blanket on the bed. It’s raggedy, worn. Pillowcase too.

WOODY
You think he keeps his victims down
here or something?
Davey inspects the AUTOGRAPH on a RED SOX TEAM POSTER...

DAVEY
“To Wayne. Keep it up, Slugger.”
94.

He finds the year on the poster -- 1956. Davey looks around
with new eyes, realizes why it all seems off. Everything’s
frayed and yellowed under a sheen of mold and dust. It’s old.

DAVEY
Holy shit. This stuff’s all his. Like
from when he was a kid or something.

NIKKI
But Mackey didn’t grow up here. My
dad said he's from Maine.

DAVEY
He must've brought it all here.
WOODY
You said there was gonna be proof,
Davey -- Where is it?

As the camcorder light moves around, SOMETHING CATCHES
DAVEY’S EYE ON THE WALL BEHIND THEM --

DAVEY
Wait, shine it back over there!

Woody retraces his path. The light falls on --

A WALL OF PICTURES. They move closer to discover... THE
PICTURES ARE OF THEM! SPYING! IN THEIR ROOMS, THE TREEHOUSE,
THE TENT, THE BUSHES, GOING THROUGH MACKEY’S TRASH, ON
WALKIES, USING BINOCULARS!

DAVEY
This enough proof for you?

WOODY
He was watching us the whole time!?

NIKKI
Suburbia's so fucked up.

THUD! Woody whips the light around as they all look at the
far corner of the room. STRANGE NOISES come from behind a
door they hadn't noticed. SHUFFLING... MUFFLED SOUNDS...

Davey slowly approaches the door, grabs the knob. Looks back
at Woody and Nikki. This is it.

DAVEY
Make sure you're filming.

Woody nods, terrified. Davey yanks open the door revealing --
95.

A BATHROOM. Woody shines the camcorder light around at eye-
level. Mold stains the walls beneath peeling paint. Gross.
The light finally finds a bathtub, its CURTAIN CLOSED.

FLIES BUZZ in the air -- Davey, Woody and Nikki swat at them
as Davey inches toward the curtain, HEART POUNDING... Reaches
out... GA-GLUNK... Grabs it... Then RIPS OPEN the curtain --

A BURGUNDY SLUDGE fills the tub, a couple UNIDENTIFIABLE BITS
jutting slightly out of it.

WOODY
What the heck is that?

Davey grabs the plunger, pushes it into the sludge. Rotates
whatever's in there, EXPOSING MORE OF IT.

DAVEY
Gimme some more light.

Woody focuses the camcorder’s light on the bits jutting out
of the sludge, and WE IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZE --

THE PARTIALLY DECOMPOSED HAND AND FACE OF DUSTY DEWITT, THE
MISSING REDHEADED BOY!!! !!!ii!ribbrriet

DAVEY
It’s fuckin Dusty Dewitt!

WOODY
Oh god... oh my god...

AHHHHHH! NIKKI LETS OUT A BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAM! Woody
follows her gaze, aiming the camcorder at the floor where --

A PAIR OF HANDS ARE WRAPPED AROUND NIKKI'S ANKLE! The light
reveals duct-taped wrists, moves up the emaciated arms to
find the battered face of BOBBY COKER! One ankle chained to a
radiator.

NIKKI
Get him off me! Get him off!

Davey drops to his knees, wrenching Bobby's hands from Nikki.
But Bobby grabs Davey's collar, yanking Davey's face just
inches from his own as he SCREAMS around the gag --

BOBBY
(muffled)
HELP ME!!!
96.

INT. MACKEY’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Davey and Woody burst out of the basement, holding up Bobby
between them. Nikki follows, camcorder on her shoulder
filming it all. As they bolt through the living room --
CRASH! Davey knocks a PICTURE off an end table. He looks down
at it, FACES VISIBLE IN THE MOONLIGHT. Something registers...
Davey stops to pick it up, realization in his eyes --

Woody struggles to hold up Bobby on his own --

WOODY
Davey, let’s go! .... Davey!

IN THE PICTURE, a smiling BLOND BOY (15) --

FLASH! MICROFICHE, FROM DAVEY’S TRIP TO THE LIBRARY. Front
page of the newspaper. THE SAME BLOND BOY, SMILING. MISSING.

Frantic, Davey scans all the FRAMED PHOTOS on the end tables
and hanging on the wall.

NIKKI
Davey, we gotta get outta here!

A PHOTO OF A FAT BOY (13) --

FLASH! MICROFICHE OF THE FAT BOY, MISSING...

A PHOTO OF A SHAGGY BOY (14) in his class photo --
FLASH! MICROFICHE OF THE SHAGGY BOY, MISSING...

DAVEY
These are his trophies...

A PHOTO OF A HAPPY FAMILY (MOM, DAD, TWIN TEENAGED BOYS) --
FLASH! MICROFICHE OF THAT FAMILY, MURDERED...
DAVEY
The people in these pictures aren’t

his family. They’re his victims...

Davey looks across the room at all the frames. They COVER AN
ENTIRE WALL. And then he sees --

A PHOTO OF DAVEY AND HIS FAMILY! THE ONE FROM HIS NIGHTSTAND!

DAVEY
And I’m next...
97.

He gulps down the panic. Pulls the photo from the wall. Shows
Woody and Nikki -- Pure horror washes over their faces.

MATCH CUT TO:
INT. IPSWICH POLICE STATION - LATER

A handful of COPS have the same looks of horror as they watch
the Betamax tape in stunned silence. Standing among them,
Brenda Woodworth, in her nurse’s uniform, flanked by Randall
and Sheila holding her hands in support.

THROUGH THE CONFERENCE ROOM WINDOWS, Davey watches Bobby
Coker wrapped in a blanket, his PARENTS holding him and
crying. A family reunited. Because of him.

As the tape ends, Sheriff Caldwell looks at Davey and Woody
across the table.

SHERIFF CALDWELL
You found all this in his house?

WOODY
And there's pictures of dead people
all over the fuckin walls!

Caldwell stands, addresses the gathering of cops.

SHERIFF CALDWELL
Somebody get out to Mackey’s. And
bring that sick son of a bitch to me.
(to the parents)
You folks mind sticking around to
give a report? Only take a while.

Randall and Sheila nod approval as the cops scatter ina
rush. Before heading out, Caldwell turns back.

SHERIFF CALDWELL
You two must be proud. These boys are
heroes.

EXT. IPSWICH POLICE STATION - A SHORT TIME LATER

Stepping outside, Davey takes a deep breath of fresh, cool
night air. He looks back through the glass doors to see all
the parents talking with Sheriff Caldwell.

From inside, Nikki sees him, breaks away from her parents and
jogs out to meet him.

NIKKI
Hey. You okay?
98.

DAVEY
Is it me or does none of this feel
real?

NIKKI

You're telling me. I just saw my
parents hug each other for the first

time in... awhile. So yeah...
DAVEY
Wow, that's awesome.
NIKKI
Not gonna get my hopes up but... That

happened because of you. So thanks.

DAVEY
I dunno about that. I mean --

Nikki seizes the moment -- AND KISSES HIM. Davey's eyes go
wide, then close. He's in Heaven. Like, whoa.

When Nikki pulls away, Davey's eyes stay closed.

NIKKI
See ya, Davey.

Heading back inside, Nikki passes Davey's parents who exit to
find Davey staring after her, still in a stupor.

INT. RANDALL’S CAR - HOURS LATER

The family drives in silence. Exhausted from giving a police
report, and from the depth of depravity they’re faced with.

Davey meets Randall’s gaze IN THE REARVIEW MIRROR... And
Randall dissolves to tears.

Sheila leans over on Randall, embracing him as he drives,
tears in her eyes.

Davey lets it all wash over him -- The fear, the anger, the
sorrow, the unadulterated reality of what’s happened. Tears
stream down his face as he looks back up to meet --
RANDALL'S RELIEVED EYES, in the REARVIEW once more.
RANDALL
I’m so sorry, Davey. I love you, pal.
Proud of you. Real proud.

Sheila reaches back, squeezes Davey’s hand as --
99.

INT. DAVEY’S HOUSE - DAVEY’S ROOM - LATER

Davey’s perched atop his bed, staring out the picture window.
BLUE AND RED LIGHT flickering on his face from outside.

SHEILA (0.S.)
And Davey’s got the sleeping bag all
set up for ya --

Woody, Sheila and Randall enter the room.

SHEILA
-- when your mom gets off her shift
in the morning, she’ll pick you up.

WOODY
Thanks, Mr. and Mrs. Armstrong.

Randall and Woody join Davey at the window. Look out to see
the beehive of activity below --

POLICE CRUISERS crowd Mackey’s driveway. OFFICERS move in and
out of the house carrying BAGGED EVIDENCE. Another CRUISER
sits parked at the end of Davey’s driveway. NEIGHBORS crowd
around, watching, gossiping.

RANDALL
You're safe, guys. They’ll keep an
eye out, make sure nothing happens.

Davey LOCKS HIS WINDOW.

DAVEY
Wonder where he is...

RANDALL
The A.P.B.’s been out for hours. Just
a matter of time now.

Davey climbs into bed as Woody settles in on the floor.

SHEILA
We love you. You boys are gonna be
the talk of the town. How’s it feel?

DAVEY
Like nothing’s ever gonna be the same
again...

Randall and Sheila kiss Davey on his head and exit. Once
they’re gone, Davey looks back out the window at the activity
at Mackey’s house. Woody joins him.
100.
WOODY
Think they’1l catch him?
DAVEY
There’s nowhere left for him to hide.

It’s over. We got him.

The boys give each other a high-five, crawl back into bed.
But as Davey lies down, he stares at the ceiling, worried...

HOURS LATER

The boys have finally fallen asleep. WE TRACK THROUGH the
room, OUT INTO THE --

HALLWAY. MOVING THROUGH the darkened house until we TILT UP --
ERRRRK... THE ATTIC DOOR QUIETLY OPENS, seemingly on its
own... The slide-down ladder extends toward the floor... A
SHOE drops down, hits the first step. A COP’S SHOE.

INT. DAVEY’S HOUSE - DAVEY’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Still asleep in his bed, Davey stirs a bit. Rolls over on his
side, back to the doorway --

SENSING SOMETHING, HIS EYES OPEN AS --

A HAND, A CHLOROFORM RAG, COMING DOWN, SMOTHERING HIS MOUTH
AND NOSE, MUFFLING HIS HYSTERICAL SCREAM!

DAVEY FIGHTS FOR A MOMENT... But his spirit is quickly sapped
thanks to the chemical’s handiwork.

Davey looks into MACKEY’S EMPTY EYES as his own flutter shut.
FADE TO BLACK

OVER BLACK

The CONSTANT SUMMERTIME DRONE OF KATYDIDS AND CRICKETS...

WAVES GENTLY WASHING ASHORE, not far away...

A TUGBOAT HORN, far off in the distance...

FLASHING LIGHTS, BLUE AND RED, through closed eyelids...

BWOOP-BWOOP! A POLICE SIREN SHOCKS US --

FADE UP ON:
101.

BLINK-BLINK... BLINK... AS WE COME-TO, OUR VISION IS BLURRY.
STROBING RED AND BLUE LIGHTS BLIND US. But AS OUR SIGHT
CLEARS, we realize we’re in --

INT. POLICE CRUISER - NIGHT

Davey sits up quickly, panicked. Looks around. Where the fuck
am I? Realizes he’s in the back of a cop car, WINDOWS FOGGED
UP. He’s bound at the wrists with rope and gagged. Beside
him, Woody is out cold, bound and gagged as well.

DAVEY
(muffled, through gag)
Woody! .... Woody!
Davey leans into Woody, nudging him hard as he can -- WOODY
COMES-TO. Looks around -- FREAKED THE FUCK OUT, he bolts back

against the car door, BREATHING HARD.
Davey moves his jaw and neck, makes his way out of the gag.

DAVEY
Turn around. I’1l untie you.

Davey and Woody sit back-to-back. Davey struggles to loosen
the rope around Woody’s wrists. Finally unties it. Hands
free, Woody removes his gag, unties Davey’s wrists --

WOODY
Davey, what the fuck is going on!? I
don’t even know how I got here --

DAVEY
It’s Mackey.

WOODY
Where the hell are we!?

They wipe the fog off the windows. Scan the darkness outside,
illuminated in bursts by the STROBING POLICE LIGHTS...

WOODY
I can’t see shit!

THUD! SOMETHING HEAVY HITS THE SIDE OF THE CAR -- The boys
jump away from the windows, eyes darting every which way.

WOODY
The fuck was that!?

DAVEY
I don’t see anything!
102.

WHAM! A ROCK HITS, LODGES INTO THE FRONT WINDSHIELD,
SPIDERWEBBING THE GLASS --

DAVEY /WOODY
AHHHHHH!

SILENCE AGAIN. No signs of life. Just absolute stillness --

CRASH! A ROCK SHATTERS THE WINDOW BESIDE WOODY, shards of
glass cutting the side of his face! They bolt to the other
side of the car, looking all around!

DAVEY
We need to get outta here!

WOODY
No way!

They listen intently, peering desperately into the woods
through the fogged-up glass. Nothing in view. No movement.
The painful anticipation is shattered as --

THUD! The guys spin around to find --

MACKEY! HIS MANIACAL FACE just inches away! IN HIS HAND, HE
HOLDS A HUGE SERRATED KNIFE AGAINST THE GLASS --

WOODY
RUUUUN!

AHHHH! Woody opens the door opposite Mackey, bolts out, Davey
hot on his heels! They sprint for the surrounding woods as --

A POWERFUL FLASHLIGHT SLICES INTO THE WOODS AFTER THEM, its
beam fractured, cascading across the trees. The boys peel off
into the darkness...

MACKEY (0.S.)
(via cruiser loudspeaker)
I know how much you guys like games.
So I’ve got a surprise for you.

As they run, the SOUND OF THE POLICE SIREN ECHOES OUT!
REMAINS ON! A SYMPHONY OF DEATH FOR MACKEY TO HUNT TO!

MACKEY (0.S.)
(via cruiser loudspeaker)
We’re gonna play Manhunt, only now,
we’re gonna play for real!

Davey and Woody stop, both leaning against a tree, out of
breath, utterly petrified. Is this really happening!? Davey
notices a PISS STAIN down Woody’s leg.
103.

DAVEY
Hey. He won’t catch us if we keep
moving. All right? Let’s go.

SPRINTING THROUGH THE WOODS, the boys finally come to a
clearing to find --

WATER! The dark, remote Ipswich Bay stares back at them! No
other land in sight!

WOODY
What the hell...?

Davey turns around to find MACKEY’S FLASHLIGHT BEAM IS GONE!
He looks in all directions... Nothing! The SHRILL SCREAM OF
THE POLICE SIREN just adds to the panic as --

DAVEY
Where’d he go!? Come on!

Davey instinctively ducks back into the treeline, sprinting
diagonally between the water and the police cruiser, its
lights still flashing chaotically.

The dense forest zips past as they dash through, adrenaline
pumping. They come to another clearing, revealing --

WATER! Again! Still no land in sight!

DAVEY
Where the fuck did he take us!?

WOODY
(realizing, desolate)
A barrier island. He knows no one
comes out here.

DAVEY
What? It can’t be an island! He drove
his car!

Woody crouches at the water line. Watches the movement of the
water in the moonlight...

WOODY
Tide’s coming in.

DAVEY
What’s that got to do with anything?

WOODY
I grew up clam digging with my Uncle
around these islands. At low tide,
there’s a road onto them.

(MORE )
104.

WOODY (CONT’D)
At high tide, the road’s covered by
water.

DAVEY
So what does that mean?

WOODY
If we don't find the road off the
island soon, we're gonna be stranded
out here til the tide goes back out.

DAVEY
We have to go back to the cruiser.
Follow the tracks.

THE POLICE SIREN ABRUPTLY STOPS! KATYDIDS AND CRICKETS once
again own the night. Waves gently wrestle with the shore.

WOODY
He’s at the cruiser right now! We
can’t go back there!

DAVEY
How deep is it? Can we swim?

WOODY
The undertow and rip tides are
insane. We’d be as good as dead.
These islands aren’t that big. If we
just keep going around, eventually --

DAVEY
We’ll find the road.

MOMENTS LATER, the guys are in a mad dash along the edge of
the island. The dense tree canopy blocks most of the light
from the moon, just enough getting through to light the way --

Woody trips over SOMETHING, rolls his ankle, FALLS HARD. As
Davey comes to help Woody up, they both lock eyes on --

THE BLISTERED, DECOMPOSING BODY OF A TEENAGE BOY!

WOODY
AHHH --

DAVEY BLOCKS WOODY’S MOUTH as they both fall away from the
body, terrified! But they quickly realize THEY’RE IN A PUDDLE
OF SLUDGE FROM ANOTHER DECOMPOSING BODY!

They slip and slide to their feet, backing away quickly. They
look around, speechless at the sight of --
105.

BODIES, in varying stages of decomposition and burial. It's
impossible to tell, but there could easily be twenty of them.
Maybe more. IT’S MACKEY’S KILLING FIELD!

Woody spots something. A FAMILIAR, EMPTY, STRIPED BAG. He
kneels down. Sees that it’s --

WOODY
“Noah”...

Empty bags of the stuff litter the ground --

DAVEY
Get down!

MACKEY’S FLASHLIGHT PEEKS THROUGH THE TREE, not too far away.
Davey and Woody try to be as silent as possible, watching as
THE FLASHLIGHT MOVES CLOSER...

MACKEY (0.S.)
I know you’re close.

DAVEY
We gotta get to the cruiser.

Woody nods agreement, but suddenly dissolves into tears.

WOODY
I don’t wanna die out here, Davey. My
Mom needs me.

DAVEY
You’re not gonna die. I got you into
this mess, I’m gonna get you out of
it. We’re gonna split up --

WOODY
Why you always wanna split up?

DAVEY
We have to. Because I’m gonna be your
diversion. I'll get Mackey’s
attention so you can get to the
cruiser. Find a way out.

WOODY
I’m not gonna let you --

But before Woody can protest, DAVEY BOLTS --
DAVEY

Hey Wayne! Fuck you, you fuckin
loser! Eat shit!
106.

MACKEY SPOTS HIM! GIVES CHASE!

DAVEY RUNS LIKE HELL, FLASHLIGHT BEAM waving chaotically as
Mackey sprints after Davey, frenzied!

Davey zig-zags through the brush! He’s never run faster in his
life, pure adrenaline coursing through his veins! Until --

DAVEY TRIPS OVER A FALLEN TREE! Quickly pulls himself into
the nook beneath it, GASPING FOR AIR!

Quiets himself... SILENCE. Where the fuck is he!? Is he
gone!? Did I lose him!? Shit...

Davey slowly, hesitantly peeks out from under the tree --

SLIT! DAVEY BUCKLES, BLOOD POURING OVER HIS SHOE, HIS
ACHILLES SLICED IN HALF!

DAVEY
AHHH!

AND THEN MACKEY’S THERE! IN DAVEY'’S FACE! He tears Davey out
from under the tree! THROWS HIM TO THE GROUND as he cleans
the blood off of his MASSIVE KNIFE!

MACKEY
Stay the fuck there.

Mackey takes off, disappearing into the night. Seriously
injured and hobbled, tears form in Davey’s eyes. He musters
his strength, SCREAMS --

DAVEY
WOODY! HE’S COMING! RUUUUUN!

EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

WOODY. Racing through the dense overgrowth. TERRIFIED.

He breaks free of some low hanging branches and stops. Sees
the SQUAD CAR about 50 yards ahead, LIGHTS still coloring the
night. Makes a dash for it --

WHAM! A BODY careens out of the shadows, SLAMS INTO WOODY!
They tumble over each other, whacking the ground hard.

WOODY
No! Please! Let me go!

Landing face first, Woody WHEEZES in pain, the wind knocked
out of him. Before he can get up, a HAND GRABS HIS HAIR.
YANKS HIS HEAD UP --
107.

WOODY
DAVEEEEY!

AND A KNIFE SLITS HIS THROAT! !!!!!1}Piibbrrdbrrdrbage
Woody's WHEEZING abruptly turns to a SURPRISED GURGLE.

Still clutching Woody’s hair, Mackey gets down low over him.
Puts his head against Woody’s, face drawn in an expression of
ecstasy as he PANTS hard and relishes the struggle of WOODY’S
FLAILING DEATH THROES. THE BOY’S FINAL, AGONIZING BREATHS.

When it’s over, Mackey stands, soaked in his prey’s blood.
Eyes closed in rapture, chest heaving, he smiles wide. Alive.

EXT. WOODS - CONTINUOUS

On his feet, barely, Davey hobbles toward the RED AND BLUE
LIGHTS. Leg gushing blood, it drags behind him, useless.
Teeth gritted, he GROWLS through the pain and tears. Urging
himself on. He finally sees the SQUAD CAR ahead --

THE BLINDING LIGHT OF A FLASHLIGHT CATCHES HIM. Coming
closer... CLOSER...

He crumples to his knees, SOBBING.

MACKEY GRABS DAVEY. Crouches and draws him close. Their faces
just inches apart. Covered in blood except his big, bright
eyes, Mackey looks truly terrifying. He whips the KNIFE to
Davey’s throat. Davey CRIES OUT in fear.

HATRED MAKES MACKEY'S VOICE QUIVER. He digs the knife into
Davey’s skin just a bit, DRAWS BLOOD -- Davey WHIMPERS.

MACKEY
You brought this on yourself! All you
had to do was leave me alone! This is
YOUR GODDAMNED FAULT!

DAVEY
(pleading)
I’m sorry. I’m so sorry!

MACKEY
Sorry? You forced me out of my home!
Stole my life! And you think you can
get out of this by saying you’re
sorry!? All I want to do is kill you.
I want you dead RIGHT FUCKING NOW!

Davey winces! But the killing blow doesn’t come...
108.

MACKEY
But that’s not enough. Not for you.

Through the fear, Davey meets Mackey’s gaze. Confused.

MACKEY
You’ve spent so much time thinking
about me. I want you to keep thinking
about me and imagining what I’m going
to do when I come back for you. And I
will. After you’ve lived looking over
your shoulder, seeing me in every
dark corner, every nightmare. Live in
the fear that every day might be the
one I come back to claim what’s mine.
One day... you’ll be right.

Mackey shoves Davey to the ground. STOMPS ON DAVEY’S SLASHED
LEG. Davey SCREAMS in pain. Mackey smiles and turns back into
the darkness --

Davey CRIES OUT in pain, unable to move. After a few moments,
HE HEARS the squad car’s driver side door OPEN -- SLAM SHUT.
Davey struggles to sit up as the CAR’S ENGINE STARTS UP.

DAVEY
No --

Dirt and rocks kick up behind the car as it drives off into
the night. THE RED AND BLUE LIGHTS FADING into the void --

DAVEY’S FACE, alternating red and blue in the lights, is
swallowed whole by the night as we --

FADE TO BLACK

SLOWLY FADE UP on STROBING LIGHTS. Distant and numerous. WE
SOON REALIZE WE’RE LOOKING STRAIGHT DOWN FROM --

EXT. JUNIPER STREET - CUL-DE-SAC - HIGH ABOVE - NIGHT

HALF A DOZEN POLICE CRUISERS, parked throughout the cul-de-
sac, their LIGHTS bathing the lawns and houses in blood red
and crime scene blue.

WE PAN OVER THE STREET, CROWDED WITH NEIGHBORS AND COPS, TO
THE EQUALLY CROWDED BACKYARDS, TO THE WOODS behind the
houses. FLASHLIGHTS scour the darkness in all directions --

THE VOICES OF TERRIFIED, DESPERATE PARENTS AND POLICE CALL
OUT INTO THE NIGHT --
109.

NEIGHBORHOOD PARENTS
(distant, echoing)
DAVEY! -- WOODY! -- DAVEY! --

It’s another Manhunt. As the PAN MOVES over the woods, we --
FADE TO BLACK
SLOWLY FADE UP as HEADLIGHTS cut the darkness, revealing a
single, hobbling SILHOUETTE. It raises its arms, desperate for
help. The headlights slow. Stop as the silhouette collapses.
The driver's door opens and a FISHERMAN (male, 60s) jogs over.
INT. PICKUP TRUCK - EARLY MORNING
Davey, exhausted, barely holding onto consciousness, lies
against the passenger window. Wrapped in a blanket. Pale as
shit. He might not make it to the hospital.
The fisherman is doing his best to reassure Davey and keep
him awake. WE CAN’T HEAR WHAT HE’S SAYING, but his expression
is one of panic, SPEEDING as fast as he can.
Davey stares out the window, in another world. The sun just
starting to rise, the sky turning from black to indigo blue.
He perks up a bit suddenly as the truck passes --

MACKEY’S SQUAD CAR. ABANDONED on the side of the road. AND ON
FIRE, all its identifying marks scorching to oblivion.

Davey’s head turns, watching it as they go by. Terror in his
eyes. Mackey’s long gone. Somewhere out there. Waiting...

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

Randall and Sheila hold Davey tight, the family all sitting
on Davey’s hospital bed. CRYING together. Relieved. Broken.

EXT. DAVEY’S HOUSE - DAY

Randall's CAR pulls into the driveway. NEWS REPORTERS and
CAMERAMEN crowding the front porch rush to the car as --

Davey hobbles out, LEG IN A CAST.
SEA OF REPORTERS
Davey! /David!/Can you tell us what
happened?/How’d you survive?

Randall helps Davey along, shielding the boy as they reach
Sheila and head inside, leaving the news folk clamoring as --

DISSOLVE TO:
110.

EXT. JUNIPER STREET - CUL-DE-SAC - DAY

BICYCLE TIRES spin quickly over the sidewalk. They slow to a
stop and a familiar SHOE drops to the pavement, the other
foot in a SUPPORTIVE BOOT.

Newspaper bag slung over his shoulder, Davey stands with his
bike at the foot of Mackey’s driveway.

CRIME SCENE TAPE blocks the way up to the house, more of it
strung across the front door. But no police. The house was
searched and cleaned out long ago.

He TOSSES A THICK SUNDAY NEWSPAPER on the asphalt at his
feet. The headline reads: “CAPE ANN KILLER WAYNE MACKEY STILL
ON THE LOOSE." Davey gazes at it a moment. Pedals on...

He makes his way around the street, tossing NEWSPAPERS onto
front porches IN REVERSE OF THE ORDER AT THE OPEN.

The yards are empty. Doors closed, probably locked. Curtains
drawn. No one watering their plants or playing games in the
lawn. It’s all gone quiet. A neighborhood haunted by ghosts.

DAVEY (V.0.)
When something you never saw coming
breaks the routine... that’s when
things get really interesting.

The SOUNDS OF AN APPROACHING CAR make Davey stop. He looks to
see it’s Nikki’s parents’ car. PACKED TO THE BRIM WITH
NIKKI’S BELONGINGS. A UConn sticker on the fender.

IN THE BACKSEAT WINDOW, Nikki looks out at Davey as the car
passes. Davey gives her a solemn WAVE. She presses a hand to
the glass. The sad look on her face tells all. They hold each
other’s gaze until the car disappears from view...

DAVEY (V.0.)
But that’s what I love about this
place. It always keeps you on your
toes.

Davey pedals on... As he throws a paper to Farraday’s porch,
Davey spots Farraday looking out from his bedroom window.
Farraday holds Davey’s gaze for a moment, remorse on his
face. Then Francine comes to the window, closes the blinds.

DAVEY (V.0.)
Behind the freshly painted walls next
door, anything could be happening and
you'd never know.
111.

Passing Eats’ house, Davey looks into the side yard, sees
Eats, Kyle and their father with CROWBARS. DISMANTLING THE
TREEHOUSE. Davey stops to watch, gutpunched by the sight.
Sees Eats’ solemn face as Eats pulls another board free.

DAVEY (V.0.)
Just past the manicured lawns and
friendly waves, go inside any house.
Less than fifty feet from where you
sleep, entirely different lives are
playing out.

INT. DAVEY’S HOUSE - DAVEY’S ROOM - DAY

Now devoid of all the childish toys and collectibles that
once filled it. Davey stares at his walls, still covered in
National Enquirer pages. Tears in his eyes, in a fit of rage,
he rakes his fingers down the wall and rips them all down.

DAVEY (V.0.)
It’s easy to think of the suburbs as
a deadend. A weird Bermuda triangle
where the American dream strangles
all the excitement out of life. But
looks can be deceiving...

EXT. JUNIPER STREET - CUL-DE-SAC - NIGHT

FRONT PORCH LIGHTS GLEAM on every house. Giving a sense of
security. Everything seems quiet. Safe.

DAVEY (V.0.)
Even serial killers live next door to
somebody...

FADE OUT
