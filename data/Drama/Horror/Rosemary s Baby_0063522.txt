. MR. NICKLAS
Oh, an actor.
(Ringing for the
elevator with
his middle finger)
We're very popular with actors,
Have I seen you in anything?

GUY
Let's see. I did Hamlet a while
back, didn't I, Liz? And then we
made The Sandpiper...

ROSEMARY
He's joking, he was in "Luther"
and "Nobody Loves an Albatross"
and a lot of television plays
and commercials.

 

The elevator doors slide open, They enter.

 

The commercials.

ROSEMARY
Yeso

Guy
And the artistic thrill, too.

Rosemary gives him a pleading look; he gives back
one of stunned innocence and then makes a leering
vampire face at the top of Mr. Nicklas’ head.

ROSEMARY ;
Did she die in the apartment?
Not that it -

MR. NICKLAS
Oh, no, in a hospital,

Mr, Nicklas presses the pearl bell-button (the name
L. Gardenia is mounted above it on black plastic)

MR. NICKLAS
She'd been in a coma for weeks.

Mr. Nicklas turns a key in the lock, Despite lost
fingers he works the knob and throws the door smartly.

MR. NICKLAS
After you, please, She was very old
and passed away without ever waking.

INT, THE APARTMENT = (DAY)

Four rooms divided two and two on either side of a
narrow central hallway that extends in a straight
line from the front door, The first room on the
right is the kitchen, It has a six-burner gas stove
with two ovens, a mammoth refrigerator, a monumental
sink, dozens of cabinets, a high ceiling and a window
on Seventh Avenue, On a chrome table, roped bales of
“Fortune” and "Musical America." Opposite the
kitchen, another room with windows facing onto a
narrow courtyard, which has apparently been used as
a combination study and greenhouse, Hundreds of
small plants, dying and dead, stand on jerry-built
shelves under spirals of unlighted fluorescent tubing;
in their midst a roll-top desk spilled over with
books: and papers.

As they are looking through the apartment, Mr.
Nicklas continues:

MR. NICKLAS
I'll be grateful to go that way
myself when the time comes. She
was chipper right to the end...
She'd been one of the first women
lawyers in New York State,

Rosemary nudges Guy and indicates the desk, She
leaves Guy and Mr. Nicklas and goes to it, stepping
over a shelf of withered brown fronds. She touches
the old wood. It is a handsome desk, broad and

I believed it to be. I can no longer associate

looks up at Mr. Nicklas.

ROSEMARY
Is this for sale?

MR. NICKLAS
I dontt know. I could find out for you.

Guy
It's a beauty.

ROSEMARY
Isn't it?

-She looks about smiling.

MR. NICKLAS
It would make an ideal nursery.

ROSEMARY
White and yellow wallpaper would
brighten it tremendously.

She looks at the closet filled with potted seedlings.

GUY
What are all these?

ROSEMARY
Herbs, mostly.
(Pointing)
Mint. Basil.

Further along the. hall. is a guest closet on the left
and, on ‘the right, a wide archway opening into the
Living Room. Two large bay windows, small fireplace
and high oak booksheleves,

ROSEMARY

She finds Guy's hand and squeezes it.

GUY
Mmm.

squeezing back her hand)

MR. NICKLAS

GUY

What she's trying to do is get
you to lower the rent.

MR. NICKLAS
(Smiling)
We would raise it if we were
allowed. Apartments with this
kind of charm -

Mr. Nicklas stops short and looks at a mahogany
secretary at the head of the central hallway.

MR. NICKLAS
That's odd. There's a closet
behind that secretary. I'm
sure there is.

Mr. Nicklas goes closer to the secretary. Guy stands
on tiptoe.

Guy
You're right.

ROSEMARY
She moved it. It used to be
there.

She points to a peaked silhouette left ghost-like on
the wall near the bedroom door, and the deep prints
of four ball feet in the burgundy carpet. Faint
scuff-trails curve and cross from the four prints to
the secretary's feet where they stand now against the
narrow adjacent wall.

MR. NICKLAS
Give me a hand, will you?

Guy and Mr. Nicklas, between them, work the secretary
bit by bit back toward its original place.

GUY
I see why she went into a coma.

The secretary lodges in its four footprints, Mr.
Nicklas massages his hands.

MR, NICKLAS
I'm authorized to show the apartment.

He goes to the door and opens it. The closet is
nearly empty; a vacuum cleaner at one side and four
wood boards at the other, The overhead shelf is
stacked with blue and green bath towels.

GUY
Whoever she locked in got out.

MR, NICKLAS
She probably didn't need five closets.

ROSEMARY
Why would she cover up her vacuum
cleaner and her towels?

MR. NICKLAS

I don't suppose we'll ever know.
She may have been getting senile

AUGUST 5, 1965 .

| Small, well-equipped and slightly old-fashioned.

Guy is leaning against a tall refrigerator, glass of

wine in his hand. Rosemary is sitting on a stool,
also with wine. HUTCH, wearing an apron and one oven
glove, is bent double, looking in the oven. He is
English, has a broad shiny face and a few strands of
wetted-down hair combed crossways over his skull.

HUTCH
I was tempted to write the manage-
ment that you were drug addicts and
litterbugs.

Rosemary and Guy laugh.
HUTCH

Instead, I lied and said that you'd
be wonderful tenants.

ROSEMARY
You're great, Hutch.

I hope though, that I can talk you
out of it.
GUY
(To Rosemary )
He's pulling your leg.
HUTCH
I'm not indeed.
Hutch straightens up, red-faced, perspiring, holding
a@ large joint of lamb.
GUY
Gee, that looks great.
Hutch, holding the joint out in front of him, leads
the way into the other room.
This is small, dark and neat. There is an inscribed
photo of Winston Churchill and a period sofa. Two
bridge tables, each with its typewriter and piles of
paper. There is another table at the side, laid for
dinner and looking out of place. Hutch goes to this
fl @ table and puts down the joint.

HUTCH
Are you aware that the Bramford had
rather an unpleasant reputation early
in the century?

HUTCH
It's where the Trench sisters
performed their little dietary
experiments, and Keith Kennedy
held his parties. Adrian Marcato
lived there too; so did Pearl Ames.

ROSEMARY

were the Trench sisters? Who was Adrian Marcato?

HUTCH
The Trench sisters were two proper
Victorian ladies. They cooked
and ate several young children,
including a niece.

GUY
Lovely.

HUTCH
Adrian Marcato practiced witchcraft.
He made quite a splash in the nineties,
announcing he had conjured up the
living Satan. Apparently people be-
lieved him; so they attacked and nearly
killed him in the Bramford lobby.

ROSEMARY
You're joking.

HUTCH
Later the Keith Kennedy business
began, and by the twenties the house
was half empty.

Guy
I knew about Keith Kennedy, I didn't
know Marcato lived there.

ROSEMARY
(Shuddering)
And those sisters!

Hutch sits down and they start eating.

Guy and Rosemary enter. He is carrying a lamp and a
shopping bag. Rosemary pulls the key out of the door
and follows Guy along the hallway. The apartment is
empty, except for a few pieces of furniture in the den,
from Mrs. Gardenia's son. The rooms are dark and full
of shadows. Faint blue light comes through the win-
dows. Guy turns into the living room, Rosemary to the
bedroom; there are many packages spread on the floor
(results of the shopping) and a solitary vanity.
Rosemary kneels, opens a wooden crate, and pulls out
three plates from the shavings. Guy comes in; she
hands him the plates and starts putting back the
shavings. We hear a woman's voice from behind the
wall.

MRS. CASTEVET (0.s.)
Roman? Bring me in some root
beer when you come!

Guy and Rosemary look at each other.

: Guy
I didn't know they were still
making Ma and Pa Kettle movies.

He goes back to the living room. Rosemary follows
him. On her way, she stops and looks toward the
closet at the end of the hallway. She goes to it and
opens it slowly. She takes out one of the four boards
leaning against the side, turns it and looks at it.
Guy has plugged the lamp in the living room and a
light comes through the archway.

ROSEMARY
Hey, these are shelves!

Rosemary brings the shelf into the Living Room, puts
it on the floor; they picnic on it - tuna sandwiches
and beer - sitting on the rug. .

ROSEMARY
Let's make love!

They unplug the lamp, strip and start making love.
Wide-eyed with fear, Guy hisses.
Guy
Shh! I hear - the Trench sisters

MRS. CASTEVET is wrapped in light blue, with snow-white
dabs of gloves, purse, shoes and hat. Nurselike she
supports her husband's forearm. He is dazzling, in an
every-colour seersucker jacket, red slacks, a pink bow
tie, and a grey fedora with a pink band, He is seventy=
five or older; she is sixty-eight or nine. They come
closer with expressions of young alertness, with friend-
ly quizzical smiles, The 2nd Policeman steps forward
to meet them and their smiles falter and fall away.

Mrs. Castevet says something worryingly; MR. CASTEVET
frowns and shakes his head, His wide thin-lipped mouth
is rosy-pink, as if lipstickeds; his cheeks are chalky,
his eyes small and bright in deep sockets, She is big-
nosed, with a sullen fleshy underlip, She wears pink-
rimmed eyeglasses on a neckchain that dips down from
behind plain pearly earrings.

2ND POLICEMAN
Are you folks the Castevets on
the seventh floor?

MR. CASTEVET
We are.

You have a young woman named Theresa

Mr. and Mrs. Castevet laugh, Guy along with them.
Rosemary smiles and cuts her steak, It is difficult
to cut, and flanked by peas and mashed potatoes.
From her expression we can gather it doesn't taste
good either.

MR. CASTEVET

shopping bag. There are roses in a vase'on the table.
Rosemary puts down the shopping bag and goes in sur-
prise to examine them, She inhales their scent.
Taking off her coat, she goes into the Living Room.
There are roses there also. Guy comes in from the
Bedroom, one rose in his hand, and kisses her.

GUY
I've been a creep. It's from
worrying Beumgart would regain
his sight, rat that I am.

ROSEMARY
That's natural, You're bound to
feel two ways about -

Guy lifts the rose to her nose, Then he turns and
walks toward the Kitchen. Rosemary follows him.

Guy
Listen, even if I'm Mister
Yamaha for the rest of my days,
I'm going to stop giving you the
short end of the stick.

Rosemary scrapes the uneaten mousse from her napkin

moment, then blink and frown.

She..shakes her head to clear the dizziness, then rolls
the napkins up inside the tablecloth and puts the
bundle aside. She turns the water off and loads the
dirty dishes into the full sink. She dries her hands
on the kitchen towel ard as she hangs it up, another
wave of dizziness maxes her swivel and hang on to the
edge of the sink. This time it lasts longer.

She straightens up and makes it to the doorway of the
Den. She keeps her footing with difficulty by holding
on to the knob with one hand and the jamb with the
other.

making it possible for her to see the frescoes from

covered with gingham contact paper, we can hear
voices off screen.

Huteh on the dock. We see him from further off and

ately surrcunded by a dozen naked men and women.

Guy is among them. They are elderly, the women
grotesque and slack-breasted. There is also Mrs.
Castevet, Laura-Louise and Mr. Castevet in a black
mitre and black silk robe. With a thin black wand,
Mr. Castevet is drawing designs on her body, dipping
the wand's point in a cup of red held for him by a
SUN-BROWNED MAN. The point moves back and forth
across her stomach and down to the insides of her
thighs. The NAKED PEOPLE are chanting - flat, un-
musical, foreign-tongued syllables - and a flute or
clarinet accompanies them. Guy's eyes are large and
tense. He whispers to Mrs. Castevet.

GUY
She's awake, she sees}

MRS. CASTEVET
She don't see. As long as she ate
the mouse she can't see nor hear.
She's like dead. Now sing.

Lady comes into the Ballroom. She wears an exquisite
ivory satin gown embroidered with pearls. She hurries
to Rosemary's side.

Guy comes and benés over Rosemary. He strokes her
with both hands - a long relishing stroke that begins
at her bound wrists, and slides down over her arms,
breasts, loins and between her legs. He repeats this
stroke several times; his hands are rough now and
sharp-nailed. Rosemary breathes, faster, He slips a
hand in under her buttocks and raises them. He lies
forward upon her, his broad chest crushing her breasts.
He is wearing a suit of coarse leathery armour. As .
he is making love to her, she opens her eyes and sees

she. picks up her handbag, opens it and takes out the
wrapped book. The doorbell rings. Still carrying tho
book, Rosemary goes to open the door. -Mrs. Castevet
stands ‘there with. the drink and a little white. cake.

MRS. CASTEVET

wasn't very long.

With a paring knife Rosemary cuts the string of the
package and undoes the brown paper. It is a black
book, not new; the gold lettering, all worn away, says:
"All Of Them Witches by J.R. Hanslet." On the flyleaf
is HUTCH'S signature, with the inscription: “Torquay,
1934." Rosemary goes into the living room, riffling
its pages. There are occasional photographs of
respectable-looking Victorians, several underlinings

and marginal checkmarks. One underlined phrase is:
"the fungus they call 'Devil's Pepper'." Rosemary
sits in one of the window bays and looks at the table
of contents. The name: "Adrian Marcato" is the title
of Chapter Four. Other chapter titles: "Prudence
Duvernoy: Stanley Rolfe; Aleister Crowley; Margaret
Wick; Witch Practices; Witchcraft and Satanism.
Rosemary turns back to the chapter: Adrian Marcato.
"Born in Glasgow in 1846, he was brought soon after to
New York (underlined)...he was attacked by a mob out-
side the Bramford...."

ROSEMARY
Outside. Not in the lobby.

There is a standing portrait of Marcato, a hypnotic-
eyed black-bearded man. Rosemary turns the page.
There is a less formal photograph of him sitting at a
Paris cafe. The caption reads: "Paris, 1899. Adrian
Marcato, his wife and son, Steven." The name "Steven"
is underlined. Rosemary flips through the book;
pauses for other underlinings. A few pages later:
"the universally-held pelief in the power of fresh
blood.

Rosemary looks up from the book, and whispers:

ROSEMARY
But there are no witches. Not

really.
She closes the book, looks at the title.

ROSEMARY
'The name is an anagram.'

Holding the book on her lap, she looks at the ceiling;
then at the book again. Suddenly, she stands up and
goes to get the Scrabble Set. She puts the book, an
open board and the box on the floor. Kneeling in
front of them, she picks up the letters to spell:
"All Of Them Witches". She jumbles the letters, mixes
them round and starts building a new sentence; it
comes out: "Comes with the fall". Then: "How is
hell fact me". She looks at the one letter left in
her hand for a moment. Then, mixes the letters again
and forms: "Elf shot lame witch" and "Tell me which
fatso".

ROSEMARY
That really makes sense.

She replaces the receiver, breathing deeply in relief.
She notices that somebody is standing outside, back
against the door. It is a MAN looking like Dr. Sapir-
stein. Rosemary, who has been bending to pick up her
suitcase, is unable to move. She remains in this
position for several seconds until the MAN turns and
looks at her, She straightens up, opens the door, and
suitcase in hand goes quickly away.

EXT, THE DOORWAY OF DR. HILL'S OFFICE - (DAY)

She gets out, shrinks, trying to be as small as possible,
and hurries to the door.

Dr. Hill opens it. He wears a blue and yellow plaid
sport shirt. He had grown a moustache, blond and
hardly noticeable. He shows Rosemary inside.

INT. DR. HILL'S OFFICE - CONSULTING ROOM - (DAY)

Rosemary sits in an armchair. Dr, Hill sits beside
the desk.

o ROSEMARY
You see, he lied to you. He said
we were going to Hollywood. The
worst thing of all, he is involved
with them as well. He sleeps in
pajamas now, He never used to before,
He's probably hiding a mark. You lnow,
they give you a mark when you join.
All sorts of rituals. They hold
Sabbaths there, You could hear them
singing through the wall, Guy, my
husband, said it was Dr. Shand, one of
these people, playing a recorder. Now,
how did he know it was Dr. Shand unless
he was there with them? They're very
clever, They planned everything from
the beginning. I suppose they made
some sort of a deal with Guy. They
gave him success and he promised them
a baby. To use in their rituals. I
know, this sounds.crazy, but I've got
books here, I'll show them to you. -

Rosemary opens her suitease, takes the two books out
of it, finds a place in the large one and hands it to
Dr, Hill.

ROSEMARY (Cont'd)
There was another actor like him, ©
Donald Baumgart, and they cast a spell

Wh.

Rosemary is speaking, Dr. Hill examines the cover and
starts flicking through the leaves.

ROSEMARY
I had a friend, Edward Hutchins.
Maybe you heard of him? A writer.
He wrote for boys. Anyway, he was
a friend of mine since I first
came to New York.

DR. HILL
(Holding book)
May I keep it?

ROSEMARY
Yes, please.

Rosemary gives him the smaller book also. Dr. Hill puts
it on top of the larger one at the side of his desk.

ROSEMARY (Cont'd)
Once, Mr. Hutchins came to visit me.
It was the time I had this pain. I
was suffering so much, Doctor, you
can't imagine how much I was suffer-
ing. And they wouldn't help me.
Nobody would. They were giving me a
drink, with tannis root. Also a
witch stuff. Tannis root. So,
Hutch came and immediately saw some-
thing was wrong. He knew about
witches, you see. Suddenly Guy
rushed in with his make-up still on,
which he never did. They must have
called him to get home and steal one
of Hutch'ts belongings. So he did.
Took his. glove, and they cast a spell
on him too. Put him in a coma.
Three months later-he died. . Maybe
all this is coincidence but one thing
is certain. They have a coven and
they want my baby.

DR. HILL
It certainly seems that way.

Rosemary shuts her eyes and almost cries from happi-

that Dr. Hill believes her. She opens her eyes

and looks at him, calm and composed. Dr. Hill had
moved behind the desk and is writing. Rosemary, who
was clutching the chair arms, relaxes her hands and
dries her palm on her dress.

No, Dr. Shand is one of the group.
The doctor is Dr. Sapirstein.

DR. HILL

He rises and goes to the open door of his examining
room, reaches inside and switches on an ice-blue
fluorescent light.

DR. HILL
I'll see what I can do, then I'll
check you over.

Rosemary hefts herself up and goes, clutching her hand-

He comes into the examining room after her. There is
a day bed at the far end of the room covered in blue,
and a chair. There are blue curtains on the window.
Dr. Hill switches on the air conditioner in the window.
It 1s a noisy one.

ROSEMARY
Shall I undress?

DR. HILL
No, not yet. It'll take some
half-hour on the telephone. Just
lie down and rest.

He switches off the light, goes out and closes the
door. There is a nice glow of evening light from
behind the curtains. Rosemary. puts her handbag on a
chair, and sits down heavily on the day bed.

ROSEMARY

God bless Dr. Hill.

She shakes off her sandals and lies back gratefully.

ROSEMARY
Everything's okay now, Andy-or-
Jenny. We're going to be in a nice
clean bed with no visitors and -

She sits up suddenly, opens her handbag, takes out the
fold of bills and counts them. There is some more
money in her purse. She takes it out and adds it to
the fold of bills. She takes the capsules out of her
handbag, puts the money back in, closes it and puts it
on the chair. She looks at the bottle of capsules in
her hand.

ROSEMARY
Monsters!

She puts the bottle on the chair beside the handbag,
lies back again on the day bed.

In front of a large contemporary house in Beverly Hills,
Rosemary rocks a bassinet, There are ten to twelve
persons around; her family and some of her friends,
Looking over shoulders, each one tries to see into the
bassinet. Rosemary picks up the baby.

ROSEMARY
He'll be four months in two days.

Rosemary cradles the baby in her arms. Elise Dunstan

The door opens. Dr. Hill looks in. Rosemary, lying
on the day bed, looks at him. Dr. Hill switches on
the fluorescent light. Rosemary shields her eyes
with her hand and smiles at him.

ROSEMARY
I've been. sleeping.

Dr. Hill withdraws, pushing the door wide open, Guy
and Dr. Sapirstein come in. Rosemary sits up, lower-
ing her hand from her eyes. They come and stand close
to her. Guy's face is stony and blank. He looks at
the walls, not at her.

DR. SAPIRSTEIN
Come with us quietly, Rosemary.
Don't argue or make a scene, because
if you say anything more about
witches or witchcraft we're going
to be forced to take you to a mental
hospital. You don't want that, do
you? So put your shoes on.

Guy finally looks at her,
GUY
We're just going to take you home,
No one's going to hurt you.

There is a car waiting with Mr. Gilmore at the wheel.

Nobody says anything; they drive in silence.

Guy, Rosemary and Dr. Sapirstein walk across the
lobby towards the elevator. Diego smiles at Rosemary
from the open door of the elevator. As they walk
Rosemary sneaks open her handbag at her side, hooks a
finger through the key ring and holding onto the keys,
spills the handbag onto the floor near the elevator.
There are coins, rolling lipstick, bills fluttering
all over the floor. Rosemary looks down stupidly.
Guy and Dr. Sapirstein start to pick the contents up.
Diego comes out to help them, making tongue-teeth
sounds of concern.

A handkerchief is jammed into her mouth and held there
by a small strong hand. They drag her away from the
bed so Dr. Sapirstein can come in front of her with
the hypodermic and a dab of cotton.

Rosemary moans through the handkerchief; a contraction;

she clenches shut her eyes, holds her breath, then

Hello, girls, PhewS Ninety-five

Rosemary takes the pill, lifts it to her mouth and
fakes swallowing it. She takes the glass of water
and drinks it. Simultaneously, with her other hand,
she siips the pill under the mattress, Eight or ten
other piils are already there. Guy cails from the

INT. BEDROOM = (DUSK)

Rosemary gets out of bed, slides her feet into slip=
pers, the puts on her housecoat. Going quietly out
of the bedroom, she walks tc the linen closet and
opens it, The shelves lock neat and orderly, piled
with bath towels, hand towels and winter blankets,

Rosemary takes everything out of the closet except
what is on the fixed top shelf, She puts towels and
linens on the floor, then lifts out the four ginghame
covered shelves, The back of the closet, below the
top shelf, is a single large white-painted panel framed
with narrow white molding. tanding close and leaning
aside for better light, Rosemary san see that where
the panei and the molding meet, the paint is- broken

in a continuous line, She presses at one side of the
panel and then at the other; presses harder, and it
Swings inward on scraping hinges. Within is darkness;
a@ second closet with a wire hanger glinting on the
floor, and one bright spot of light, a keyhole.
Pushing the panel all the way open, Rosemary steps
into the second closet and ducks down,

Through the keyhole, Rosemary sees at a distance a |
small curic cabinet that stands at a job in the hall-=
way of Mr, and Mrs, Castevet's apartment. Rosemary
tries the door, It opens, She cleses it and backs
out through her own closet and goes to the kitchen.
From her knifesrack, Rosemary takes the longest
sharpest carving knife. As she is leaving the kit=
chen, we hear a key working in the lock of the front
door. Rosemary rushes intc the nursery, brushing
against the new bassinet, and presses herself against
the wall,

‘Guy enters and goes into the kitchen, opens the fridge

and takes out ice cubes.

Rosemary sees that the bassinet is swinging. She
stops it with the point of the long knife.

Guy comes out of the kitehen with Hutch's ise bucket
in his hand. He opens the entrance docr and goes out.

Rosemary listens for a moment, then moves out to the
front door and chains it. Holding the knife point-
down at her side, she goes down the hallway to the
linen closet door, She cpens it, goes through again
into the second closet (quick glance at the under-
neath of the fixed top .sheifs like in the dream),
looks through the keyhole and cracks open the door
into the Castevet's apartment, Holding the knife
point forward, Rcesgemary pushes the door wide open
and steps through. The hallway is empty. There are

Ice cubes clink, She betters her grip on the knife

Across the room, in the one large window bay, stands
a black bassinet, skirted with black taffeta, hooded
and flounced with black organza, A silver ornament
turns on a black ribbon pinned to its black hood.
The stiff organza trembles, The silver ornament
quivers and we can see that it is a crucifix hanging
upside down, with the black ribbon wound and knotted

Rosemary wipes her hands on her housecoat, throws
back her hair, finds a fresh grip on the knife's
thick handle, and steps out where they can see-her,
Insanely, they don't. They go right on talking,
listening, sipping, pleasantly partying: Mr. and
Mrs, Castevet, Guy, Mr. Fountain, the Weeses, Laura-
Louise and a studious~-looking young Japanese with
eye-glasses. All gathered under an over-the-mantel
portrait of Adrian Marcato (the same as in the book),

Rosemary watched them until she is by. the bassinet,
which is angled in their direction, With her free
hand, she catches the black-covered handle and swings
the bassinet slowly, gently, around to face her, .
Taffeta rustles, the black wheels squeal, She looks
in, Smiling gently, she slowly reaches her left arm
to take the baby. The smile fades on her face and
changes into an expression of horror, She backs
slowly away and freezes with her eyes wide open.

ROSEMARY

have you done to its eyes?
They stir and look to Mr, Castevet,.

a large box wrapped in light blue paper patterned
with Teddy bears and candy canes, Musical sounds coms
from it.

Everyone gathers to meet him and shake his hand.

There is a confused, hushed conversation from which
words like "Worried - pleasure -- airport -
Stavropoulos -- occasion" can be heard, Laura-Louise
brings the box to the bassinet, She holds it up for
the baby to see, shakes it, and puts it on the

window seat, There are other boxes similarly wrapped
and a few that are wrapped in black with black ribbon.
Mr, Castevet draws Argyron Stavropoulos forward,

MR. CASTEVET
Come, my friend. Come see Him.
Come see the Child.

They go to the bassinet. Laura-Louise waits with a
proprietary smile. They close around it and look

into it silently. Argyron Stavropoulos lowers himself
to his knees.

Guy comes back from the kitchen, over to Rosemary.
He stands looking down at her,

GUY -

hurt, and you haven't been, really.
I mean, suppose you'd had a baby .-

Rosemary puts the handkerchief on the table, looks at

Guy, and, as hard as she can, spits at him. Guy
flushes and turns away, wiping his face,

Laura-Louise rocks the bassinet, The baby starts
whimpering. Mr. Castevet catches Guy by the arm,

MR. CASTEVET

Argyron Stavropoulos.

-Argyron Stavropoulos clasps Guy's hand in both his

own.

MRS. CASTEVET
Nothing is in it. It's plain ordi-

forth towards her, holding it.by its hood. Rosemary
stands still and looks at him,

ROSEMARY
You're trying to get me to be his

Aren't you His mother?

Slowly, Rosemary lets the black-covered handle come
into her hand, and closes her fingers around it, For
a few moments they rock the bassinet between them,
then Mr, Castevet lets go and Rosemary rocks it alone,
nice and slowly, Mr, Castevet withdraws silently to
where everybody now stands in a semi-circle, watching.
Dr. Sapirstein comes into the room and looks at the
scene. in surprise. Mrs, Castevet puts her finger to
her lips. The Japanese steps forward and crouching
down to find an angle, clicks his camera, Very
softly, Rosemary is humming. From behind the window,
we can.hear the distant noise of the-street. and cars
hooting, The sun has. already set behind the buildings
and the pleasant evening light covers the city.
