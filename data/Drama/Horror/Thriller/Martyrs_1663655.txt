MARTYRS

EXT. BALTIMORE - DAY

The shitty part of town... down by the docks. Rows
of boarded-up old buildings line a pot-holed street.

And this world is silent as we drift along the center
of the empty pavement... move tight on one of those
puddle-filled mini-craters... close enough to see the
sky’s cloudy reflection in the milky water

It’s all so peaceful...

...until a SMALL, BARE FOOT SPLASHES INTO THE PUDDLE.
And then we see who the foot belongs to...

...a LITTLE GIRL, (LUCIE), (10), wearing just a
stained, tattered gown... her bruised, terrified face
lined with tear-streaks through the filth... her
mouth open wide, like she’s screaming but nothing
will come out.

And Christ, she’s running fast... as fast as her
little body will take her... those bare feet SMACKING
THE PAVEMENT as she throws frantic glances over her
shoulder...

...but the street behind her is empty...

...S0 she just keeps running toward us... like we’re
the only people in the world that might be able to
save her.

And as she nears, her SCREAM FINALLY ERUPTS... a
painful, horrifying cry.

And EVERYTHING GOES BLACK...

...Stays that way as Lucie’s SCREAM ECHOES OVER US...
finally fading...

...as small circles of light begin to sweep across
the dark screen, and we find ourselves...
INT. CONDEMNED BUILDING - DAY

Dark and shadowy, except for the POLICE FLASHLIGHTS
floating over the scene.
COPS move around a deserted building... rusty pipes
along the ceilings... rats scurrying across the
floor... every room is empty.

A COP stops beside our lead DETECTIVE.

CoP
We sure this is the right
building?
The Detective nods... scans the room.
DETECTIVE
It’s the one the girl pointed
out.
CoP

Whoever was in here, they sure
didn’t leave any scraps.

ANOTHER COP leans into the room.

COP #2
Nothing upstairs.

Cop #2 walks back out.

CoP
Maybe she was just too scared...
pointed at the wrong one.

The Detective steps out into a long, dark hall... it
looks creepy as hell, but no different than any other
decayed old corridor.

His eyes follow the trail of his flashlight beam over
the empty floor.

DETECTIVE
Yeah... maybe.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. SAINT MARY’S ORPHANAGE - DAY

An old compound. DOZENS OF CHILDREN run around a
playground... swinging... sliding... climbing.

These are the lost children of Baltimore...
abandoned... abused... forgotten. None of them will
leave this place until they’re old enough to walk out
on their own... alone.
But right now, none of them seem to mind too much...
they’re laughing... having fun...

...except for one little girl... our Lucie... sitting
on a tree stump, her back to the others.

She’s staring out into the distance... maybe looking
for whoever it is that might still be chasing her.
Most of her bruises have all healed... at least the
ones we can see.

Then she looks down... to a SKETCH PAD ON HER LAP...
a half-finished crayon picture of a SMALL FIGURE
SITTING IN A SINGLE CHAIR AT THE CENTER OF A SQUARE
ROOM.

What looks like it could be a SMALL BUCKET rests just
beneath the chair.

Lucie lifts a RED CRAYON... makes some marks around
the floor... on the walls.

VOICE (0.S.)
Hi.
Lucie doesn’t acknowledge the voice... keeps making
those red marks.

So the voice kneels down beside the stump... a pretty
little girl, ANNA, (10). She’s holding two cookies...
extends one of them out to Lucie.

Lucie glances at it, then to Anna, before going back
to her drawing. Anna rests the cookie on the stump

beside Lucie... takes a bite of her own.
ANNA
I’m Anna.
Lucie doesn’t respond... like she didn’t even hear
her.

ANNA (cont’d)
You’re Lucie, right? That’s what
the Sisters said.

Still nothing... just the scratching of that crayon
on the paper.

ANNA (cont’d)
Do you wanna play or something?
Even Anna knows she isn’t going to get an answer.
But she still crouches there beside Lucie for a
moment... giving her a chance before finally
standing...

ANNA (cont’d)
Bye.

...Walks away... doesn’t see behind her... Lucie
stops drawing... lifts the cookie... takes a nibble
as her eyes rise from the sketch pad... to whatever’s
out there in the distance.

INT. SAINT MARY'S ORPHANAGE/ANNA’S ROOM - NIGHT

Just the dim glow of a hall light creeping through
the open door. Anna lies in bed, staring at the
ceiling... whispering.

ANNA
I pray the Lord my soul to take.
If I should...

An 0.S. SCREAM interrupts Anna’s prayer. A familiar
scream. Lucie’s scream. Anna looks to the hall...
Two NUNS hurry past.

Anna climbs out of bed... moves to the door, and
peers out... watches them rush into a room.
NUN (0.S.)

It’s okay, Lucie. There’s no one
there. No one’s going to hurt
you.

Lucie’s CRYING floats down the hall to Anna, as she
just stares at Lucie’s dark doorway.

EXT. SAINT MARY’S ORPHANAGE - DAY

The playground. Just like before, Children running
around... except for Lucie, back on her stump... not
drawing this time... just gazing out... the sketch
pad resting beside her...

...@ CHILD’S DRAWING OF A DARK FIGURE IN A DOORWAY on
the open page.

Anna walks up beside her, again holding two cookies.
ANNA
I sneak in the kitchen when
Sister Rachel is doing her beads.

Lucie doesn’t react. Anna starts to rest the cookie
on the stump again, but this time Lucie reaches
out... eases the cookie from Anna’s hand.

ANNA (cont’d)
They’re still warm.
(beat )
You don’t have a family either,
huh?

Lucie just takes a bite of the cookie. Again, Anna
waits for an answer she isn’t going to get. So she
turns to leave... just as Lucie inches over on the
stump... knocking her sketch pad to the ground.

But now there’s room for two.

Anna smiles... drops down beside her... watches Lucie
take another bite, then looks out into the
distance... silently sharing Lucie’s stare.

And then we go to a...
SERIES OF SHOTS...

ANNA AND LUCIE CLIMBING A TREE... PULLING THEMSELVES
UP THROUGH THE BRANCHES UNTIL THEY’RE NEAR THE TOP...
LOOKING DOWN ON THE KIDS AND NUNS BELOW.

ANNA AND LUCIE RACE LAUGHING OUT OF THE ORPHANAGE
KITCHEN, EACH HOLDING SEVERAL COOKIES AS A NUN YELLS
AFTER THEM.

ANNA AND LUCIE ON THE PLAYGROUND... TWIRLING ON THE
MERRY-GO-ROUND... LYING ON THEIR BACKS... WATCHING
THE SKY CIRCLE ABOVE THEM.

IN THE CHAPEL... ALL THE CHILDREN KNEELING IN THE
PEWS... DEEP IN PRAYER. ANNA AND LUCIE SIDE BY
SIDE... ARMS INTERLOCKED... PALMS PRESSED TOGETHER...
EYES SQUEEZED SHUT... UNTIL ONE OF LUCIE’S EYES
OPEN... TAKES A QUICK GLANCE AT ANNA... ALMOST LIKE
SHE’S MAKING SURE HER FRIEND IS STILL THERE WITH HER.

DETECTIVE (V.0.)
The Sisters say you’ve become
good friends with Lucie.
INT. SAINT MARY’S ORPHANAGE/OFFICE - DAY

Anna sits in a chair, as a couple NUNS stand nearby,
and the Detective sits across from her. Anna looks
nervous... manages a nod.

DETECTIVE
Does she ever say anything...
about the people that hurt her?

ANNA
No.

DETECTIVE
What kind of things does Lucie
tell you, Anna?

Anna looks to one of the Nuns. The Nun gives her a
nod... it’s okay to tell him.

ANNA
She talks about monsters a lot.
She says they’re still out there.

DETECTIVE
Monsters.

Anna nods again.
DETECTIVE (cont'd)
Has Lucie ever told you what the
monsters look like?

CUT TO:

INT. SAINT MARY'S ORPHANAGE/LUCIE’S ROOM - NIGHT

A FLICKERING NIGHTLIGHT casts a stuttering glow over
the room.

Lucie’s in her nightgown, ready to climb into bed.
But then she glances to the door... to the darkness
that lies beyond.

She slides a chair over... the metal legs SCREECHING
across the tile floor. Lucie closes the door...
props the chair against the handle, holding it shut.

The nightlight FLICKERS... enough to shoot Lucie into
motion... she charges to her bed...
leaps into the covers, pulling them up around her
face. But at least she made it.

And then that NIGHTLIGHT FLICKERS OFF. The ROOM GOES
PITCH DARK. Lucie yanks the covers up over her face.

CUT TO:

LUCIE’S POV UNDER THE COVERS... THE DARKNESS BLEEDING
THROUGH THE SHEET. ALL WE CAN HEAR IS LUCIE’S FRANTIC
BREATHING...

...until the NIGHTLIGHT FLASHES BACK ON. A glow
returns above the sheet.

Lucie lowers the sheet... looks to the night-light...
full glow. And just as she’s about to relax...

...she sees the door standing open... the chair slid
back across the room. Someone moved it

Lucie just stares in fear... doesn’t even realize
she’s stopped breathing.

AND THEN A SHAPE DARTS THROUGH THE SHADOWS BESIDE
LUCIE.

She spins... nothing there. But there was something,
so Lucie ducks back under the covers again, and we go
with her...

...Staring through that thin sheet, at the dim glow
beyond. And just like before, the world is silent...
not even Lucie’s breathing this time.

Then through the sheet, we see a SILHOUETTE RISE AT
THE FOOT OF THE BED... no way to see who it is.

LUCIE
(whispers)
Anna?

No answer. Just that shadow standing over us. And
Lucie closes her eyes... wants the shape to be gone
when she opens them.

But it isn’t.

So she slowly pulls the sheet back... the room inches
into dim view...

...until we see what’s at the end of Lucie’s bed...
this horrible, disfigured CREATURE...
almost like the living corpse of a woman with long
hair matted around her emaciated face.

Lucie opens her mouth to scream, but just like the
first time we saw her, nothing comes out... and the
Creature leaps.

CUT TO:

INT. SAINT MARY'S ORPHANAGE/ANNA’S ROOM - NIGHT

Anna in bed. Lucie’s SCREAM POURS OVER HER. Anna
leaps from bed... charges out the door.

INT. SAINT MARY'S ORPHANAGE/LUCIE’S ROOM - NIGHT

Anna races into the room... turns on the light... the
bed’s empty. The sheets are tossed about, scattered
to the floor.

Anna scans the room. Her eyes settle on the CLOSED
CLOSET DOOR. She eases toward it... takes the
handle... twists it open...

...and there inside the dark closet is Lucie...
huddled on the floor, deep gashes torn into her arms.
Lucie starts to scream again, but sees that it’s only
Anna... so she holds out one of her bloody hands to
her friend.

Anna steps inside, closing the door behind her, then
slides down to the floor, and pulls Lucie against
her... holds her... like a mother comforting her
frightened child.
ANNA

It’s okay. I won’t let them hurt

you anymore.
As Anna holds Lucie...

DETECTIVE (V.0.)
Do you believe her?

CUT TO:

INT. SAINT MARY’S ORPHANAGE/OFFICE - DAY

Anna still sitting across from the Detective.
DETECTIVE
Do you believe the things Lucie
tells you about her monsters?

Anna stares back at the Detective a long beat... long
enough for us to tighten on her face... to her tiny
lips. Then in the softest of whispers.

ANNA
I don’t know.

And we SLAM TO BLACK... wait in the darkness as a
WORD RISES FROM THE DARK. Our TITLE...

MARTYRS

Then the word fades with the black... until sunshine
and blue sky take over.

EXT. UNIVERSITY - DAY

The ivy-streaked stone buildings of a busy UNIVERSITY
CAMPUS.

SUPERIMPOSE: TEN YEARS LATER

INT. LECTURE HALL - DAY

Half-filled with STUDENTS. A PROFESSOR stands at the
front, as a PICTURE OF A MIDDLE-EASTERN PROTEST is
projected on a massive screen. Mobs of PEOPLE pack
the street.

PROFESSOR

In this one image, we can see the
pain on the faces. The blood on
clothing... in the street.

(turns to the

Students)
So where is the observer?
Obviously, he’s taking the
photograph, but is the observer
also in the photograph?

(points to the

students)
Anna.

There among the other Students is ANNA, (20), grown
into a beautiful young woman, with a spark in her
eyes. She studies the photograph a moment, then...
10.

ANNA
Yes. The Observer is in it.
PROFESSOR
Why?
ANNA
The focus is on the fear... the
faces of the protesters... their

struggle. But the police, the
soldiers... they’re all
blurred... almost secondary.
This isn’t their story.

PROFESSOR
Exactly.

A GIRL, (CHRISTINE), a few seats down from Anna
playfully rolls her eyes... throws a crumpled wad of
paper at her.

PROFESSOR (cont'd)
The observer’s bias, right or
wrong, is held within the image.
It’s what he wants us to see.

The Professor hits a button... the photograph changes
to another image from the same riot... a Soldier
helping a fallen Woman.

PROFESSOR (cont'd)
Werner Heisenberg calls it the
uncertainty principle. That the
observer always affects the
observation.

ANGLE ON ANNA...
...as she eyes the photograph.

PROFESSOR (0.S.) (cont'd)

If you shine a light on something
to see it, you have by that
action changed what you are
looking at.

(beat )
So in many ways, we see what we
want to see.
11.

EXT. UNIVERSITY/QUAD - DAY

Anna walks across the quad with a group of GIRLS...
laughing and talking. Christine leads the way.

CHRISTINE
All that “Is the observer in the
picture or not shit”... it’s like

some kinda mind-fuck Where’s
Waldo game or something.

ANNA
Because you’ve only been to about
half the classes this semester.

CHRISTINE
And the day after exams, I’1l
fuck Professor Finchem, and we’1l
both get A’s. What took you
twelve weeks of work will take me
twelve minutes.

The laughing gets louder.

GIRL #2
God, Christine, you’re such a
little whore.

GIRL #3
And I heard Finchem is more like
seven minutes.

CHRISTINE
Even better. Gives me time to
work on my biology grade too.

Anna laughs... then sees something in the distance,
and her smile fades. She doesn’t know it, but she
stopped walking.

And then we see what Anna saw... a GIRL, (20), a long
coat hanging over her small frame. She’s too far
away to make out any features. But Anna obviously
recognizes her.

The other girls stop... look back at Anna.

GIRL #3
What’s wrong?

ANNA
I’1l catch up.
12.

The Girl follows Anna’s stare... spots the Figure.

CHRISTINE
Who’s that?

Anna’s already walking away. The Girls shrug...
continue on.

Anna makes her way across the Quad... toward the
Figure, still standing in the distance.

And as Anna moves closer, the Figure’s features come
into focus... and it’s clearly LUCIE... dark eyes
tucked in a hard face... she’d be pretty if she
cared. But she doesn’t.

Anna reaches Lucie, and neither shows any emotion...
just hold a look, then...

ANNA
What are you doing here, Lucie?

LUCIE
You used to be happy to see me.

ANNA
(forces a smile)
I still am. I’m just surprised.

Anna gives Lucie an awkward hug. Lucie doesn’t
return it.

LUCIE
I called. You never called back.
ANNA
I meant to. I’ve just been busy
with...
LUCIE
Life.
ANNA

You say it like it’s a bad thing.

LUCIE
I wouldn’t know.

ANNA
That’s your choice. I tried.
13.

LUCIE
Sweet Anna. Always trying to
help me.

Anna doesn’t want this. Not now. Not ever again.

ANNA
I’m in the middle of some things
so... what do you need?
LUCIE
I found them.
Anna’s face immediately changes... from annoyance to
anger... maybe even fear.
ANNA
What?
Lucie just nods... you heard right.

ANNA (cont’d)
You always think you’ve found
them.

LUCIE
But this time I’m sure. I want
to show you.

Anna hesitates, then shakes her head.

ANNA
I can’t.
LUCIE
Why?
A BEAT, then...
ANNA

Life. I chose to live it.

LUCIE
So can I. Once you see. Once
you believe me. I can make it

all go away.

ANNA
It’s been too long. They aren’t
out there... not anymore.

LUCIE

It’s them. I know it.
14.

ANNA
It isn’t them. It’s a face you
think you remember... just like
all the other faces you were so
sure of.

LUCIE

It’s different this time.

Anna and Lucie hold a long look, then...

ANNA
I’m sorry.
...and Anna turns... starts back across the grounds.
LUCIE
Anna.
Nothing.
LUCIE (cont’d)
ANNA!

Anna only speeds up her pace, until she’s trotting
back after her friends... leaving Lucie as far behind
her as she can.

EXT. UNIVERSITY/FRAT HOUSE - NIGHT

Music and noise raging. The MOB OF STUDENTS has
overflowed into the front yard.

INT. FRAT HOUSE - NIGHT
Music... beer... laughter.

Except for Anna, standing at a window, looking out at
the dark quad. She looks much like Lucie did that
first day at the orphanage... searching for something
while the rest of the world lives.

MARCUS, (21), good-looking Frat Boy, moves up behind
her... wraps his arm around her waist... holds a
plastic cup to her lips, but Anna leans her head away
from it.

MARCUS
What’s wrong?
15.

ANNA
I just don’t feel so great
tonight.
Marcus leans in... kisses her neck.
MARCUS

You wanna come over to my place?
We can just hang out.

Anna turns... gives him a soft kiss, then...

ANNA
I’1l call you later.

Anna pulls away... makes her way to the door. Gone.

INT. DORM/ANNA’S ROOM - NIGHT

Anna lies in bed, staring at the ceiling. In the dim
light, she doesn’t look that different than twenty
years ago.

Suddenly, there’s a SCREAM... just like Lucie’s
scream.

Anna leaps from the bed.

INT. DORM/HALL - NIGHT
Anna races into the hall...
... where she sees it’s just a BOY carrying a LAUGHING

GIRL over his shoulder. The Girl SCREAMS again.
Anna watches them disappear into a room.

INT. DORM/ANNA’S ROOM - NIGHT

Anna walks back in... sits on the edge of her bed
then opens a nightstand drawer... digs under all the
layers of junk... to a life shoved away...

...pulls out PHOTOGRAPHS OF ANNA AND LUCIE WHEN THEY
WERE LITTLE GIRLS... laughing together... making
faces... the best of friends.

Anna stares at the photographs. A tear slips down
her cheek.
16.

INT. DORM/ANNA’S ROOM - MORNING

Anna asleep. Just in front of her, a CELL PHONE
rests on a nightstand beside the old photographs.

The phone VIBRATES... stops... VIBRATES again... loud
enough to stir Anna awake. Her eyes try to open...

can’t. She reaches blind for the phone... answers.
ANNA
Hello?
LUCIE (V.0.)

I need you to believe me.
Lucie’s voice opens Anna’s eyes.

LUCIE (V.0.) (cont'd)
I need you to see them too.

Anna just lies there a moment, then...
ANNA
Tell me where you are.
EXT. RURAL ROAD - MORNING

ANGLE ON A MAILBOX... the numbers 497 tacked to the
side. We PULL BACK from the mailbox...

...to a beat-up, old Honda Civic sitting along the
edge of a dirt road. Lucie’s behind the wheel,
staring at the FARMHOUSE in the distance... a wide
cornfield beside it.

She looks beyond the house...

...to a MAN, (50's), working on a tractor in the
backyard.

EXT. FARMHOUSE/BACKYARD - MORNING

The Man steps off the tractor... looks at the massive
sinkhole in front of him...

...ten feet deep by six feet wide... a collapsed tree
at the center.

The Man climbs down into the hole... starts tearing
at one of the muddy walls with a shovel.
17.

We can make out the METAL RING OF A LARGE DRAINAGE
PIPE. He’s trying to clear it.

INT. FARMHOUSE/KITCHEN - MORNING

Large and open... a CRUCIFIX hangs on a wall along
with FAMILY PHOTOS. Newspaper articles hang on the
refrigerator door... a TEEN GIRL WINNING A SWIM
MEET... a TEEN BOY HOLDING A SOCCER TROPHY.

Then we see the Two Teens at the table, the BOY, (17)
and GIRL, (15), slurping back cereal, as their
MOTHER, (50's), fries some bacon on the stove.

MOTHER
What’s the plan for today?
(off their shrugs)
Well I need your rooms cleaned
before anyone goes anywhere.

BOY
I’m supposed to pick Katie up in
an hour.

MOTHER
I just looked at your room... you

better call and tell her you’re
going to be late. Real late.

The Boy GROANS.

GIRL
I thought she broke up with you.

BOY
Nobody breaks up with me.

GIRL
I don’t think Katie knows that
Neither does the guy she was
slobbering on at the lake last
night.

The Girl grins... she loves messing with big brother

BOY
You're full of shit.

MOTHER
Hey.
18.

GIRL
He says it all the time.

The Man from the hole enters through the back door.

MOTHER

Not in front of me he doesn’t.
MAN

What’s not in front of you?
MOTHER

Nothing.
GIRL

Brandon said I was full of shit.

MAN
He’s probably right.

The Boy chuckles... the Girl flips the Boy off.

The Man pulls a slice of bacon off the counter... the
Mother gives his hand a smack.

MOTHER
Wash your hands.

The Man glances at his hands... filthy.
MAN

A surgeon’s hands should never
get this dirty.

He presses a palm against the Mother’s ass... leaves
a HANDPRINT ON HER PANTS before going to the sink
MOTHER
Randall!
MAN

(to the Boy)
After breakfast I’m going to need
you to help me downstairs.

BOY
Mom said I had to clean my room.

MAN
Soon as we’re done.

The Boy GROANS again... not the way he wanted his day
to start.
19.

BOY
Why doesn’t Nicole ever have to
help down there?

The 0.S. RING OF THE DOORBELL. The Man starts out of
the room toward it.

MAN
Because I love her more.

The Girl flicks a piece of cereal at the Boy.

INT. FARMHOUSE/ENTRY - MORNING
The Man reaches the door... pulls it open...
...and there’s Lucie in that long coat of hers.

MAN
Can I...

Before he can finish, Lucie has a SHOTGUN PULLED FROM
BENEATH THAT COAT. Ina flash, it’s leveled at the
Man’s chest...

...BOOM...

...like the Man was hit by a truck. His body flies
back into a mirror, shattering it. The glass rains
down on top of the bloody corpse.

WOMAN (0.S.)
Randall!?

The Woman comes racing into the entry... as Lucie
steps inside. The Woman sees Lucie and her husband’s
corpse at the same moment... is frozen...

...BOOM... Lucie’s shot hits her in the stomach. The
Woman twists to the floor.

And now the kids are both SCREAMING... leaning out to
see what’s left of their parents...

...as Lucie steps over the bodies... walks toward the
kids, reloading her shotgun as she moves.

GIRL
NO!

The Girl takes off down the hall... the Boy back into
the kitchen.
20.

INT. FARMHOUSE/KITCHEN - MORNING

The Boy hurries to the counter... grabs a KNIFE...
spins...

...and there’s Lucie standing in the doorway, shotgun
raised.

LUCIE
Sit down.
The Boy doesn’t move... is weighing his chances
against that shotgun... finally realizes they aren’t

good, and sits at the table.

LUCIE (cont’d)
How old are you?

The Boy is too scared to answer.

LUCIE (cont’d)

HOW OLD!
BOY
Seventeen.
Lucie considers that... doing the math in her head.
LUCIE

Did you know about the things
your parents did?

The Boy looks confused... manages a shrug. And that
must be good enough for Lucie, because she lowers the
gun... just stares at the Boy a beat...

... before swinging it back up again.

CUT TO:
INT. FARMHOUSE/BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
The Girl stands against the closed door. The 0.S.
GUNSHOT sends her body into convulsions...
...she backs away from the door, crying...
...Sspins to the bed... dives to the floor, and crawls

under.
21.

ANGLE ON THE GIRL...

... hiding beneath the bed... a hand over her mouth
trying to stifle the crying.

From outside the room, we can hear doors being
opened... footsteps moving closer

THE GIRL’S POV... as the door suddenly swings open...
Lucie’s feet step inside, along the with tip of that
shotgun barrel almost dragging the floor

The Girl tries not to breathe... watches Lucie’s feet
move past the bed. She finally closes her eyes.

LUCIE - STANDING JUST BESIDE THE BED...

...Staring at it... finally stepping up onto the
mattress... aiming the barrel down into the bed.

And Lucie’s CRYING NOW TOO... she doesn’t want to do
this... doesn’t want to kill anyone else, but she
can’t stop... not now...

...BOOM...

...feathers explode from the comforter... float
around the room like snowflakes.

And everything’s silent...
.»..as a PUDDLE OF BLOOD OOZES OUT FROM UNDER THE BED.

Lucie drops to her knees on the bed... breaks down...
whatever brought her here is over.

LUCIE
I’m sorry... I’m sorry... I’m
sorry.

INT. FARMHOUSE/HALLWAY - DAY

Lucie kneels over the lifeless Woman... strokes her
face with bloodsoaked hands.

LUCIE
Why did you do those things to
me? Why? Tell me!
22.
Lucie begins shaking the Woman... as if she’s trying
to awaken her.

LUCIE (cont’d)
How could you? HOW COULD YOU?!

Lucie finally stops shaking her... just drops back
against the wall, looking at the bodies.

LUCIE (cont’d)
I was just a little girl.

EXT. RURAL ROAD - DAY

Anna’s car pulls up alongside the mailbox... those
same numbers... 497... and Lucie’s car sitting off in
the grass.

INT. ANNA’S CAR - DAY

Anna pulls out her CELL PHONE... starts to dial, then
stops... NO SIGNAL.

EXT. RURAL ROAD - DAY

Anna climbs out of her car... holds the phone out...
turns in a circle, looking for some flash of life...
nothing.

So she looks to that farmhouse... hesitates a beat
then tosses the phone back into her car, and starts
walking up the drive.

EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY

Anna crosses the yard... through the picket gate...
up the walk...

...and slows when she sees the front door standing
open. She doesn’t like the feel of this.

Anna stops... looks around.

ANNA
Lucie?

No answer.
23.

ANNA (cont’d)
(toward the door)
Hello?

Nothing. So Anna starts moving again... up the front
stairs...

...the view inside the door rising with each step she
climbs...

...until the MAN’S BLOODSOAKED LEGS COME INTO FOCUS,
twisted on the entry floor.

ANNA (cont’d)

Oh, God.
Anna begins to tremble... trips a little on the top
step... stares in the door at the Man...

...the Mother lying beyond him.

LUCIE (0.S.)

I didn’t have a choice.
Anna spins with a start... sees Lucie standing on the
walk behind her... blood spattered across her face...

that shotgun still in her hands. Anna’s scared out
of her mind.

ANNA
Lucie... what did you do?

LUCIE
What I had to. I told you it was
them.

ANNA
No... you were going to show them
to me. We were going to tell the
police.

LUCIE

The police wouldn’t have believed
us. You know that. They don’t
care anymore. No one cares
anymore.

Lucie starts up the steps toward Anna... as Anna eyes
that shotgun moving closer.

LUCIE (cont’d)
Except you and I, Anna.
24.

Lucie gently takes Anna’s hand in hers. Anna
stiffens at the touch... lets Lucie guide her into
the house.

LUCIE (cont’d)
I want you to see... so you’1l
believe me.

INT. FARMHOUSE/ENTRY - DAY

Anna and Lucie stand over the Man’s bloody corpse...
his lifeless eyes frozen in a final stare.

LUCIE
It’s him. His face has changed a
little, but the eyes... I know
those eyes.

Anna can’t control herself any longer... vomits.

LUCIE (cont’d)
He’s the one, Anna.
(pointing to the
Mother )
And her.

Anna just shakes her head... backs up against the
wall.

ANNA
It’s been too long. You don’t...
(beat )
You can’t be sure.

LUCIE

ANNA
Not sure enough to do this.

LUCIE
IT’S THEM!
(calms herself)
Why don’t you believe me?

Anna moves deeper into the house... sees the DEAD BOY
CRUMPLED IN THE CHAIR... she GASPS IN HORROR.

LUCIE (cont’d)
They knew.
25.
ANNA
They?

LUCIE
The children.

ANNA
There are more?

LUCIE
A girl.

ANNA
Oh, God. Lucie...

LUCIE
They knew what their parents were
doing.
Anna shakes her head...

ANNA
No... no.

Anna can’t take anymore... starts for the door...
fast. Lucie grabs her.

LUCIE
Anna, wait. You have to believe
me.
Anna keeps moving... almost running now... just
trying to get out of this house... away from all this
death.

Lucie follows after her.

EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY

Anna charges down the porch steps. Lucie runs out of
the door behind her.

LUCIE
Anna! PLEASE!
Anna stops... turns back to Lucie.
ANNA

I can’t help you anymore.

Lucie’s eyes fill with tears. This is the end, and
she knows it.
26.

LUCIE
Please...
Anna shakes her head... turns and starts down the
walk... back toward the road.
Lucie collapses to the steps... just sits there,

watching Anna leave her.

ANGLE ON LUCIE...

...the front doorway just behind her. And we HOLD ON
LUCIE a long beat... the sadness in her eyes...

...when SUDDENLY A SHAPE DARTS THROUGH THE SHADOWS
INSIDE THE HOUSE... too fast for us to see what it
was.

Then the CRASH OF A VASE SHATTERING spins Lucie to
the doorway... she looks in... confused... maybe
frightened. Who did she miss?

INT. FARMHOUSE/HALLWAY - DAY

Lucie eases down the hall... stops in the living
room, where the SHARDS OF A BROKEN VASE are scattered
on the floor.

Lucie stares at the pieces... as she reaches into her
coat pocket... pulls out TWO SHOTGUN SHELLS... opens
to gun... slides them in, then SNAPS the gun back
into position...

...just as the CEILING CREAKS ABOVE HER... FOOTSTEPS.

INT. FARMHOUSE/STAIRWAY - DAY

Lucie slowly climbs the stairs, that shotgun ready to
fire.

EXT. FARMHOUSE/DRIVE - DAY

Anna’s crying... walking toward the road... toward
her escape.
27.

INT. FARMHOUSE/UPSTAIRS HALL - DAY

Lucie inches down the hall... glancing in each open
doorway she passes. And we’re just waiting for
something to spring out of one, but they don’t... and

Lucie keeps walking...
...Until a DOOR SLAMS SHUT BEHIND HER.

She turns... stares at it a beat, then charges...
fast... reaches the door, and kicks it open... gun
raised to finish off whoever’s behind it.

The door swings wide...

...and there’s that SAME MONSTROUS CREATURE WE FIRST
SAW ON LUCIE’S BED TEN YEARS AGO... what could be a
WOMAN...

...long, black hair matted over a bony, skeletal
frame. But we don’t get a clear look before the
CREATURE SPRINGS AT LUCIE... knocking her back...

...Lucie’s finger instinctively SQUEEZES THE
TRIGGER... BOOM... but the shot fires harmlessly into
the ceiling as she falls.

CUT TO:
EXT. FARMHOUSE/DRIVE - CONTINUOUS
Anna turns to the gunshot... watches as a CLOUD OF
BIRDS EXPLODE FROM THE TREES.

CUT TO:

INT. FARMHOUSE/STAIRWAY - CONTINUOUS

Lucie sails backward through the railing, with the
Creature on top of her... tearing at her... they hit
the stairs... CRACK... tumble down in a blur

Lucie SLAMS to the bottom with a THUD... loses her
gun. The Creature SCREECHES OUT... leaps again, but
Lucie kicks it away... scrambles up... trips over the
Mother’s body... her hands drip with the Mother’s
blood, as she races away.
28.

INT. FARMHOUSE/KITCHEN - DAY

Lucie tears into the kitchen... grabs the KNIFE that
the Boy once held on her... turns... waits for the
next attack.

LUCIE
Wait... please...

She holds up the bloody hand.

LUCIE (cont’d)
...I did it. It’s over.

The 0.S. SMACKING OF RUNNING FEET.

Lucie keeps that hand held up as she walks into the
hall.

INT. FARMHOUSE/HALLWAY - DAY

Lucie moves along the hall, her hand leading the way.

LUCIE
I stopped them.

Then a GURGLING BEHIND LUCIE... she freezes...
doesn’t want to see what’s there, but knows she has
to... so she slowly turns...

»..to that CREATURE CROUCHED ON THE FLOOR.

LUCIE (cont’d)
See... I stopped th...

The Creature leaps... tackles Lucie. And Lucie does
her best to fight the Creature off, but it’s too
strong... tears the knife from Lucie’s hand... starts
slicing it wildly across Lucie’s chest... down her
arms.

Lucie’s SCREAMING... fighting for her life... finally
breaks free again... drags herself into a doorway.

INT. FARMHOUSE/DARK ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Lucie slams the door shut... starts to back away,
then hears TAPPING BEHIND HER.
29.

She turns... looks across the room to a METAL CHAIR
that looks just like the ones from her childhood
drawings...

...and this one has the YOUNG LUCIE is sitting in
it... trying to pull free... lifting one of those
loose, bolted legs up... TAP as it hits the floor
again.

And then a SHADOWY FIGURE walks past the Young
Lucie... stands in front of her. We can’t see the
Figure’s face, but just as the Young Lucie is about
to scream, the Figure SWINGS HIS HAND TOWARD HER
MOUTH...

CUT TO:

OUR LUCIE... THROWING HER OWN HAND OVER HER MOUTH...
TRYING NOT TO SCREAM...

»..as she slides down into the corner... and we
realize this is just a closet... there is no metal
chair... no Figure... no Young Lucie.

Then a SQUEAK, as the DOORKNOB BEGINS TO TURN...

...and Lucie can’t do anything but watch it... wait
for the Creature to come inside and kill her

The door inches open... but it isn’t the Creature...
it’s Anna... come to save Lucie again.

Lucie looks up at Anna, just the way she did when she
was a little girl.

LUCIE
It’s here, Anna.

Anna nods... drops down beside Lucie, and pulls the
door back closed again.

LUCIE (cont’d)
It hurt me again.

Anna wraps her arm around Lucie... holds her just the
way she used to... and EASES THE BLOODY KNIFE FROM
LUCIE’S HAND.

ANNA
It’s okay. I’ve got you. I
won’t let anything hurt you.
30.

Lucie buries her face to Anna’s chest. Anna gently
rocks her... larger versions of those two little
girls years ago.

INT. FARMHOUSE/BATHROOM - DAY

Lucie soaks in a tub, as Anna carefully cleans the
knife wounds across her chest.

OLD JAGGED SCARS COVER LUCIE’S ARMS AND LEGS... a
lifetime of pain.

ANNA
You need a doctor. I don’t know
how to do this.

Lucie isn’t worried about her wounds... she’s almost
smiling.

LUCIE
You should have seen his face
when he opened the door. He
recognized me too. I could see it
in his eyes.

ANNA
If it was really him.

LUCIE
It was him.
(beat )
I just wish I could have made it
last longer. Watched them suffer
the way they watched me.

Anna doesn’t want to talk about this.

ANNA
We need to hurry... finda
hospital... someplace far away.
LUCIE

After we get rid of the bodies...
clean the house back up.

ANNA
We don’t have time.

LUCIE
That’s the only way it will leave
me alone. I have to wipe them
away... like they never existed.
(MORE)
31.

(beat)UCIE(cont 'd)
Then it will have to let me go.

Anna hesitates... eyes Lucie’s face... she’s so sure.
Anna nods... stands... starts out.
ANNA
I’m going to find you some
clothes.
Lucie rests in the tub... raises her hand up above
her... studies it... it’s covered in scars zig-

zagging all over her skin.
LUCIE
It’s almost over.

INT. FARMHOUSE/BEDROOM - EVENING

Anna pulls a t-shirt from a dresser drawer... adds it
to the pants she already has in her hands.

She starts out of the room... stops in the doorway,
and looks back...

...to that puddle of blood seeping out from under the
bed...

...the hint of the Girl’s foot tucked beneath in the
shadows.

Anna stares at it a moment, then turns...
...RIGHT INTO LUCIE... her naked body dripping wet.
Anna jumps with a start.

ANNA
Jesus.

LUCIE
Sorry.

Anna hands the clothes to Lucie.

ANNA
I’1l meet you in there.

Lucie watches Anna walk away.
32.

INT. FARMHOUSE/LIVING ROOM - DAY

Anna enters... just stands there a moment before she
spots the SHOTGUN on the floor.

She throws a glance back out of the room, then grabs

the shotgun... shoves it under the couch...
...scoops up the scattered shotgun shells... rolls
them under... then backs away, just as Lucie walks
in.

LUCIE

You ready?
ANNA

Yeah.
INT. FARMHOUSE/ENTRY - EVENING
ANGLE ON THE FACE OF THE DEAD MAN...
...then we see Lucie, dressed in the borrowed t-shirt
and jeans, is holding his outstretched arms... Anna’s
got his feet... ready to drag him out the door

But Anna’s caught in a stare... can’t help.

LUCIE
What’s wrong?

Anna doesn’t answer.

So Lucie drops his hands... moves around, snatching
Anna’s arm... jerking her down... close to the Man’s
face.

LUCIE (cont’d)
Can you smell it?

Anna pulls away from Lucie.

ANNA
Lucie, stop.

LUCIE
Can you?

Anna backs away from the body... away from Lucie.
33.

LUCIE (cont’d)
I’ve known that smell my whole
life. From every time he'd beat
me. Every time he’d walk into my
cell. He’d tell me how perfect I
was... how I was the one they’d
all been waiting for.

(beat )

And then he’d pull out the
chains.

Lucie stands... moves back around, grabbing the Man’s
hands.

LUCIE (cont’d)
Don’t let what he looks like now
make you feel sorry for him.
Lucie waits for Anna to lift the Man’s feet.

Finally, Anna does... they drag the Man out the door.

EXT. FARMHOUSE/BACKYARD - EVENING
ANGLE ON THAT HOLE THE MAN WAS WORKING IN...

...as his body suddenly rolls in... tumbles to the
bottom.

Anna and Lucie stand at the top of the hole, staring
down at the corpse until...

LUCIE
We need to get the others.

Lucie walks away.

Anna stands there a moment... looks up... to the
distance...

...her car still parked along that dirt road.

She could run now if she wanted... run and leave all
this behind...

...but instead she turns... follows Lucie back into
the house...

...and we’re left alone, staring down at that corpse
at the bottom of the hole.
34.

INT. FARMHOUSE/KITCHEN - EVENING

Anna and Lucie stand over the body of the Boy, still
slumped in that chair

Lucie pulls him over... he falls to the floor...
SPLAT... his dead eyes staring up at Anna.

ANNA
Why don’t we just leave? Someone
will find them... take them out.

LUCIE
I told you. I have to do it.

Anna shakes her head... begins to tear up.
LUCIE (cont’d)
A little boy used to watch
them... the things they’d do to
me.

Lucie stares down at the dead Boy’s face. She’s
emotionless.

LUCIE (cont’d)
Find a sheet if that makes it
easier for you.

INT. FARMHOUSE/BEDROOM - EVENING

Anna tears back the covers from a bed.

EXT. FARMHOUSE/BACKYARD - EVENING

The sun is gone, replaced by a darkening sky, and
heavy rain.

Anna and Lucie carry the sheet-wrapped body across
the yard.

INT. HOLE - EVENING

ANGLE ON THE MAN’S TWISTED CORPSE...

...asS RAIN PELTS IT.
35.

THEN THE SHEET-WRAPPED BODY ROLLS DOWN THE SIDE OF
THE HOLE... falls across the Man’s... the BOY’S FACE
flops out, uncovered.

EXT. FARMHOUSE/BACKYARD - EVENING

Anna and Lucie stare down from the edge of the hole.
Lucie looks to the CRIMSON STAINS BLEEDING THROUGH
HER T-SHIRT, then raises her gaze to the sky... the
rain beats across her face.

LUCIE
I’m so tired.

Lucie glances back to the Farmhouse... to an upstairs
window, where the silhouette of a LONG-HAIRED FIGURE
peers out at her.
LUCIE (cont’d)
Do you think it will let me rest?
Just for a little while?
Anna follows Lucie’s stare... up to the empty window.
ANNA
Yes.
INT. FARMHOUSE/BEDROOM - NIGHT

Lucie sleeps on the shredded, feather-covered bed.

INT. FARMHOUSE/BATHROOM - NIGHT

Anna’s at the sink... running water over her face...
trying not to be sick.

She raises up... stares at her reflection in the
mirror.

INT. FARMHOUSE/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Anna walks into the room... glances around. Her eyes
settle on a shelf of FRAMED PHOTOGRAPHS...

...various shots of the family through the years...
smiling and laughing together.
36.

They look completely normal... the perfect family.
Not a pack of sadistic torturers.

Anna pulls down one of the pictures... sits on the
couch, and just stares at it... those faces so full
of life.

Her eyes slowly rise from the photo... to a table...
a PHONE resting there... waiting for Anna to just
pick it up.

Anna gazes at the phone... then glances to the
hall... no sign of Lucie... back to that phone again.
Finally, Anna stands... walks to the phone... another

look to the hall before she picks it up...
...we can hear the V.O. DIAL TONE.

Anna stares at the receiver a beat... until her
trembling finger hits the “9”... BEEP...

...she throws a quick glance over her shoulder to the
empty hall...

...back to the phone... “1”... BEEP...

...her finger hovers over the button... knows what
that final push means.
CUT TO:
POV FROM BEHIND ANNA... MOVING THROUGH THE DOORWAY
TOWARD HER...
...Silently closing in.
CUT TO:
ANNA...
...Staring at that “1”.
CUT TO:

OUR POV MOVING TIGHTER ON ANNA...
...almost close enough to touch her

CUT TO:
37.

ANNA...
...glancing behind her...
...but the room’s empty...

...S0 Anna makes her choice... presses that “1”...
BEEP...

...just as there’s an 0.S. THUMP FROM THE HALLWAY...

...S0 Anna quickly HANGS UP THE PHONE... turns...
waits... ANOTHER THUMP.

ANNA
Lucie?

No answer. But there’s definitely someone moving out
in that hall...

...S0 Anna eases across the living room... toward the
doorway.

ANNA (cont’d)
Lucie, are you awake?

Still nothing.

Anna steps out into the hall, and we’re ready for
Lucie or some Creature to leap on Anna, but there’s
no one...

...just the body of the Mother still sprawled on the
floor.

Anna turns... scans the other direction... THUMP from
behind her... she spins back around...

...Still no one.

And then she sees the MOTHER MOVE... somehow... her
body arch... her foot twist into the wall... THUMP.

Jesus, she’s alive.

And Anna doesn’t know what to do... just stands
frozen, staring...

...as the Mother GASPS... her eyes flutter open...
she reaches a bloody hand out to Anna.
38.

MOTHER
Please...

Anna still only stares back in shock... then looks
beyond her to the darkened doorway where Lucie
sleeps... if she’s still asleep.
Then Anna bursts into action... hurries to the
Mother... huddles over her

ANNA

(whispering)

You have to be quiet.

MOTHER
Help me.

Anna throws her hand over the Mother’s lips.

ANNA
I will, but you have to be quiet.

Anna begins to lift the Mother up... she CRIES OUT IN
PAIN.

ANNA (cont’d)
SHHHH... please. She’1l hear us.

Anna throws a nervous glance to Lucie’s doorway... no
sign of her yet.

So Anna keeps lifting...

...until the Mother is standing on her rubbery
legs... an arm wrapped around Anna’s neck.

MOTHER
My children.

ANNA
Quiet.

MOTHER
Where are they?

ANNA
I’m taking you to them. You just
have to stop talking.

Anna and the Mother make their way down the hall...
to the front door...

...as Anna looks behind them again... still no Lucie.
39.

EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT
Anna drags the Mother down the front walk.

MOTHER
Call the police. Please.

ANNA
I have a car. I’m going to take
you. We just have to hurry.

MOTHER
I can’t leave my family.

ANNA
You aren’t leaving them. wWe’re
going to...

Then a NOISE FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE... a DOOR
SLAMMING.

Anna spins to it. No one there.

Anna pulls the Mother into the shadows... bushes...
hiding from whoever is about to rush out of that
front door. Hiding from Lucie.

MOTHER
I want to see my children.

ANNA
(angry whisper)
Shut up.

MOTHER
...my little girl.

Anna clamps her hand over the Mother’s mouth.

ANNA
(whispers)
She’11 kill you if you don’t stay
quiet.

Anna holds her hand across the Mother’s lips, as she
stares through the bushes to the door...

...Still no sign of Lucie. And it’s long enough that
we start to think everything’s going to be fine.

But then a CLICK from behind them... a TWIG
SNAPPING...
40.

...and as Anna turns to it...
...LUCIE LEAPS FROM THE SHADOWS...

...SWinging that knife... slamming it down into the
Mother’s back.

The Mother CRIES OUT.
Anna falls away.

ANNA (cont’d)
LUCIE, NO!

Lucie raises the knife again... THWACK... the Mother
SCREAMS... THWACK... SCREAMS AGAIN...

...as Anna reaches in to help her, but Lucie knocks
her away... THWACK... the blade drives down again.

The Mother’s dead.

Lucie stares down at the corpse... pulls the knife
out, and turns her gaze to Anna.
LUCIE
Why?
ANNA
I was just...
LUCIE

Why did you help her?
ANNA
She didn’t deserve to die. She
didn’t do anything wrong.
LUCIE
What about all the things she did
to me? I told you.
Lucie moves toward Anna.

LUCIE (cont’d)
I TOLD YOU!

Anna starts crawling away... back toward the house.

And Lucie’s following after her, that knife still
gripped in her bloody fist.
41.

LUCIE (cont’d)
But you wanted her to live?
Instead of me?

ANNA
No.

LUCIE
Then why try to save her? Why
try to let her do it all again?

ANNA
She wouldn’t have hurt you. I
wouldn’t have let her.

LUCIE
You’re lying!

And then Lucie stops walking. The rage vanishes from
her face, as sadness replaces it

LUCIE (cont’d)
You never believed me.
(beat )
You think I’m crazy... just like
all the doctors.

ANNA
No, Lucie.
But it’s true, and Anna knows it... so does Lucie.
That’s why the tears fill her eyes. The knife slips
from her fingers... to the ground at her feet.
LUCIE

I thought once you saw, you'd
believe. That once I showed you
their faces, you could love me
again.

Anna’s too frightened to speak... just watches Lucie
walk past, back into the house.

ANNA
Lucie. Lucie!

But Lucie keeps walking.
42.

INT. FARMHOUSE/ENTRY - NIGHT

Lucie starts down the hall... looks to the smeared
blood on the floor and walls.

We hear V.0. SCREAMS.

FLASHCUT TO:

INT. CONDEMNED BUILDING - NIGHT

OUR POV gliding down a dark, empty hallway... those
SCREAMS ARE LOUDER.

CUT TO:

INT. FARMHOUSE/KITCHEN - NIGHT

As Lucie walks past... the blood spattered walls
where she killed the Boy.

She gazes at the CRUCIFIX as she passes, and we hear
THOSE SAME V.0O. SCREAMS.

FLASHCUT TO:

INT. CONDEMNED BUILDING - NIGHT

As we push through the shadows... to a tiny,
windowless room...

...a SMALL FIGURE sits chained to a chair at the
center. A rusty bucket rests beneath the chair

CUT TO:

INT. FARMHOUSE/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

As Lucie steps into a puddle of blood... tracks it
across the living room floor.

FLASHCUT TO:

INT. CONDEMNED BUILDING - NIGHT

As we float around to the front of the Small Figure,
staring directly at us...
43.

...the YOUNG LUCIE.
YOUNG LUCIE
Please. No...
INT. FARMHOUSE/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Lucie sitting on the couch, staring at us just as her
younger self was. A FRAMED FAMILY PHOTOGRAPH of the

victims rests in her lap.

LUCIE
...more. Please.

And then we see who Lucie’s talking to...

...that Creature... its horrible, twisted shape
huddled on the floor in front of her.

LUCIE (cont’d)
I’m so tired.

The Creature GURGLES... its eyes peering through that
long, tangled hair.

Then it begins crawling toward Lucie... its movements
twitchy and broken...

...Slowly dragging its form over the floor, until
it’s just in front of Lucie.

It reaches out... almost embracing her... running its
mangled, scarred hands across Lucie’s... easing the
photograph from Lucie’s lap...

...and as the Creature holds Lucie, she SMASHES THE
PHOTOGRAPH ACROSS LUCIE’S HEAD. Lucie SCREAMS OUT.

CUT TO:

EXT. FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Anna looks up to Lucie’s cry... scrambles toward it.

ANNA
Lucie!

CUT TO:
44.

INT. FARMHOUSE/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

As the Creature grabs a shard of the broken glass...
slices it down Lucie’s leg.

Lucie SCREAMS AGAIN... but doesn’t fight the Creature
off... just allows the torture...

»..as the Creature THRUSTS THE SHARD INTO LUCIE’S
OTHER LEG...

...takes Lucie’s head in her hands, and begins
SLAMMING IT AGAINST THE WALL... WHAM... WHAM...

...and Lucie is CRYING, but still powerless to stop
her...

...as Anna rushes in behind Lucie...

...sees Lucie ALONE IN THE LIVING ROOM... HER OWN
HANDS GRIPPING HER HEAD... SLAMMING IT AGAINST THE
WALL OVER AND OVER... CRYING OUT with each punishing
blow.

LUCIE
Please! No!

But the abuse continues... Lucie JAMS THE GLASS INTO
HER OWN LEG AGAIN...

...SCREAMS in pain.

ANNA
Lucie, stop!
Anna charges Lucie... grabs her arm just as she’s
about to stab herself again.
Lucie tries to fight Anna off... raises the glass to
stab Anna... then recognizes her... finally calms...

... their eyes meet...

ANNA (cont’d)
No more, Lucie. No more.

...and it’s as if Lucie is awakening from a dream. A
calmness washes over her... the shard of bloody glass
slips from her grasp.

ANNA (cont’d)
It’s gone.
45.

LUCIE
It’s never going to let me go.
Then suddenly Lucie breaks free... races straight for
the picture window... doesn’t slow down as she blasts
through.

EXT. FARMHOUSE/BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

Lucie explodes through the window... the glass rains
down as she sails out... drops the twenty feet to the
ground...

...-hits with a violent THUD.
And doesn’t move.
Anna peers down from the window.

ANNA
Lucie!

Nothing.
ANNA (cont’d)
LUCIE!
INT. FARMHOUSE/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Anna spins... races outside.

EXT. FARMHOUSE/BACKYARD - NIGHT

Anna sprints across the yard... drops to her knees
beside Lucie... rolls her over

Lucie’s unconscious... and a bloody mess.

ANNA
Please, Lucie... no.

Anna strokes Lucie’s face... kisses her

ANNA (cont’d)
Don’t leave me.

Lucie GASPS... COUGHS UP BLOOD... she’s still alive.

Anna lifts Lucie into her arms.
46.

INT. FARMHOUSE/UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - NIGHT

The Boy’s room. Soccer posters on the wall... a few
trophies on a shelf... a PROM PICTURE of the Boy and
his GIRLFRIEND.

But right now, Lucie’s asleep in his bed, wearing
just that wet, stained t-shirt.

Anna’s wrapped the wounds on her legs. She sits
there, gently stroking Lucie’s hair... her face.

FLASHCUT TO:

EXT. MEADOW - DAY

Beside the orphanage. The young Anna and Lucie race
around the meadow, SINGING as they chase butterflies
down a slope...

YOUNG ANNA
This old man, he plays ten...

YOUNG LUCIE
...he plays knick-knack once
again...

BOTH GIRLS
...with a knick-knack paddywhack
give the dog a bone. This old
man went rolling home.

And as they sing that last line, the girls tumble to
the ground... roll down the gentle slope, LAUGHING...

...finally fall still at the bottom... lay there side
by side in the high grass.

They gaze up at the sky... the clouds floating above
them.

YOUNG LUCIE
I wish I could ride a cloud. Let
it take me wherever I wanted.

YOUNG ANNA
Where would you want to go?

Lucie hesitates... this is an important question...
it deserves some real thought. Then...
47.
YOUNG LUCIE
Wherever you go.

The little girls exchange a smile... their hands meet
between them... fingers clasped.

Friends for life.

EXT. FARMHOUSE/BACKYARD - NIGHT

Anna trudges through the pouring rain, carrying the
Girl’s body... reaches the hole, and eases her down.

The Girl slides along the muddy wall... tumbles to
the bottom beside her Mother.

The family is all together again.

INT. FARMHOUSE/BATHROOM - NIGHT

Anna’s filling a garbage bag with bloody rags.

INT. FARMHOUSE/STAIRWAY - NIGHT

Anna carries the garbage bag down the steps...
reaches the bottom, and looks across the floor...

»..So much blood.

INT. FARMHOUSE/ENTRY - NIGHT

Anna’s on her hands and knees, wiping up the blood
from the floor... turning a white towel crimson
tossing it into the trash bag, then grabbing another.

As she scrubs, the PHONE RINGS. Anna freezes...
listens as it RINGS AGAIN... holds her breath as if
whoever’s calling might hear her... RING... then a
CLICK, and...

MAN (V.O.)
You’ve reached the Pattersons.
Sorry we can’t get to the phone,
we’re probably just doing
something much more important.

Anna looks at the towel in her hands... covered in
the Man’s blood, as she listens to his voice. Then a
BEEP...
48.

...but no voice on the other end... just silence...
until another CLICK, and a DIAL TONE takes over...
finally silences.

Anna goes back to work.

INT. FARMHOUSE/KITCHEN - NIGHT

Anna’s cleaning up where the Boy was killed... now
working with a roll of paper towels... slopping the
blood up.

She tears off the last shred of towel... just that
cardboard tube left. She tosses it away... starts
her search for more...

...opening cabinets... drawers... nothing.

INT. FARMHOUSE/LAUNDRY ROOM - NIGHT

Anna searches the room for towels... picks up some
folded t-shirts... they’1l work.

She opens a large cabinet door... sees a mop leaning
against the back wall of the cabinet.

Anna grabs the mop, and the BACK WALL MOVES.

Anna notices... sees a handle... pulls the wall
open... because it isn’t a wall, it’s a door.
Anna squints into the darkness beyond... reaches

deeper... finds a light switch... CLICK...

...@ row of FLUORESCENT TUBES flicker on, leading
down a narrow, cement stairway.

Anna’s suddenly curious... nervous even... drops the
makeshift rags on the floor, and steps into the
hidden passage...

...doesn’t see the small red bulb above the doorway
that begins BLINKING.

INT. BASEMENT PASSAGE - NIGHT

Anna makes her way down the steps...
49.

...reaches the dark bottom... finds another switch...
CLICK... more fluorescent tubes sizzle on... one by
one down the length of a long hall.

And there’s nothing musty or filthy about this
place... it’s clean... sterile. Like something you
might find in a hospital.

Anna stands there a moment... not sure she wants to

see what’s down here.

But her legs aren’t listening to her brain... start

walking on their own... carrying her slowly down the
hallway... her footsteps echoing...

...reaching LARGE PHOTOGRAPHS along the walls...
gruesome surgical photos... a YOUNG WOMAN WITH
STITCHES SURROUNDING HER NECK, as if her head has
been sewn onto her body. The Young Woman’s eyes are
wide open... gazing upward...

...,another WOMAN lying on a operating table... her
intestines pouring out of her open stomach... and her
EYES OPEN WIDE... GAZING UPWARD...

...an OLD WOMAN hanging from a wall... hundreds of
hooks through her skin... wires attached, suspending
her in the air. And just like the others, her EYES
ARE ROLLED UPWARD.

Anna continues past the images... down the hall until
she sees a LOCKED TRAP DOOR in the floor... she pulls
on it... locked.

She glances around... finds a RING OF KEYS... works
her way through the various shapes until one fits...
CLICK... the lock pops open.

Anna removes it... pulls open the hatch... LIGHTS
AUTOMATICALLY FLICKER ON BELOW.

There’s a metal ladder leading down into the belly of
the beast.

Anna takes a breath, then climbs down the ladder.

INT. BASEMENT AREA - NIGHT

Anna descends the ladder... reaches the bottom...
another cement hallway.
50.

She walks to the end... through plastic curtains
hanging across the hall...
...into OPEN SHOWER AREAS... keeps walking...

...down another passage. This one is lined with
SEVERAL METAL DOORS ON EACH SIDE.

Anna moves down the hall... stops at the first
door... peers in through a small glass square in the
door...

...all dark on the other side.
She pulls at the handle... locked.
She continues on to the next door... same thing.

Anna presses her nose against the glass to peer in...
too dark to see anything.

She slides down to the next door... repeats the
motion... everything’s locked down here...

...S80 she glides past the last door, tugging at the
handle without expecting it to open...

...BUT IT DOES.

Anna freezes... stares at that door cracked open...
her hand still gripping the handle... just not ready
to pull it wide.

She lets the door close... leans to the square of
glass... tries to see in from behind the safety of
beyond the door...

...but if she wants to see what’s in here, she’s
going to have to go in...

...S0 she eases the door open.

INT. DARK ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Like a prison cell... windowless walls... a METAL
CHAIR BOLTED TO THE CENTER OF THE FLOOR... just like
the one Lucie drew as a child. A BUCKET sits just
beneath the chair.

This is a modern-day version of Lucie’s nightmares.
51.

ANNA
Oh, God.

Because Anna’s world has just been turned upside
down...

...Lucie was right about this place... about those
people.

Anna sees IRON RINGS BOLTED TO THE WALLS... one of
them has a LONG, THICK CHAIN hanging from it...
coiled along the floor, then stretched out
disappearing into the shadowy back corners of the
cell.

Anna runs her hand along the ring... crouches down to
lift the chain.
LUCIE (V.0.)
And then he’d pull out the

chains.

Suddenly the CHAIN IS YANKED... the metal links
tearing across her palm...

...as it uncoils... snaps taut...
...there’s something on the other end.

Anna’s too scared to move... no idea what’s hidden in
that darkness...

...but she has to know, so she follows the chain
across the cell... stepping into the shadows...

...and huddled in the corner is the skeletal figure
of a WOMAN... nothing but scarred flesh and bones...
long greasy hair matted across her face... she looks
more monster than human... not that different than
Lucie’s Creature...

...except this woman has a METAL RING secured around
her head, completely blinding her.

The Woman cowers in the corner, emitting only
GUTTURAL MOANS.

Anna’s stunned... watches the Woman press herself
against the wall... as if she’s trying to hide from
whoever’s in here with her.

Anna moves closer... reaches out, gently touching the
Woman’s head.
52.

The Woman jerks... flails her arms to keep Anna away.
ANNA
It’s okay. I’m going to help
you.
And Anna’s voice must be so different than what the
Woman’s used to... she springs toward her, hugging
Anna’s legs... pleading in those animal tones.

Anna sees the chain is attached to a metal belt
around the Woman’s waist.

ANNA (cont’d)
I have to find a key.

Anna starts away, but the Woman clings to her.

ANNA (cont’d)
I’m not leaving you.

Anna pulls free... hurries out. The Woman CRIES OUT.
INT. BASEMENT AREA - NIGHT
Anna runs toward the ladder. The Woman’s horrible

CRIES chase after her.

INT. BASEMENT PASSAGE - NIGHT

Anna rises up the ladder... tears the ring of keys
from the trapdoor lock... descends back into the
hole.

INT. DARK ROOM - NIGHT

Anna crouches beside the Woman... turns the key...
the chain unlocks.

The Woman’s GRUNTS grow faster... excited.
Anna takes her hand.

ANNA
Come with me.

The Woman moves cautiously... unsure where Anna’s
leading her. She extends a spindly arm in front...
feeling her way.
53.

As they move out of the cell, Anna’s foot drags
across the chain... it CLANKS on the floor, and the
Woman SCREAMS OUT... jerks away from Anna... throws
her arms over her head to protect her from what
always comes next.

ANNA (cont’d)
It’s okay. I’m not going to hurt
you.

Anna gently takes the Woman’s hand again... leads her
out.

INT. BASEMENT PASSAGE - NIGHT

Anna guides the Woman down the corridor.

INT. FARMHOUSE/LAUNDRY ROOM - NIGHT

Anna steps out of the hidden door... eases the Woman
out behind her.

The Woman’s head snaps around like a confused
animal... senses she’s in unfamiliar territory.

ANNA
You don’t have to be scared. I’m
going to take you to a doctor...
someone to help you.

The Woman tugs at the metal ring... wants it off...
Now.

ANNA (cont’d)
Wait... stop.

Anna holds the Woman’s arms... looks at the ring...
sees that it’s SCREWED INTO THE WOMAN’S SKULL...

...blood seeps out where the Woman pulled at it.

ANNA (cont’d)
You need a doctor to do this. Do
you understand me? A doctor. I
can’t take it off.

The Woman calms. Anna finds a ROBE... wraps it
around the Woman’s withered frame.

ANNA (cont’d)
Come on.
54.

Anna leads her out of the room.

INT. FARMHOUSE/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Anna eases the Woman onto the couch.
ANNA
You’re in a big open room.
Nothing here will hurt you.
The Woman’s head snaps back and forth. Her hands
nervously scratch at her arms... hard enough that her
jagged fingernails tear into her own flesh...
...just the way Lucie’s arms used to look.
Anna grabs the Woman’s hands... holds them still.
ANNA (cont’d)
No. No more pain. It’s over
Do you understand me? All that’s
over.
The Woman calms... as if maybe she understands.
ANNA (cont’d)
I need you to stay here... just
sit until I get back. I have to
go upstairs... get Lucie... so we
can leave.
The Woman’s head jerks around... finally nods.
ANNA (cont’d)
You understand me? I’11 be right
back.

Another nod. Anna walks out.

INT. FARMHOUSE/STAIRWAY - NIGHT

Anna throws one last glance to the Woman before
hurrying up... reaching the top...

...just as behind her, the FRONT DOOR SWINGS OPEN.
Anna ducks behind the corner.

From here, we can just see legs and feet on the lower
floor... moving quickly through the house...
55.

...then we hear THE WOMAN SCREAM OUT.

An 0.S. STRUGGLE... until the THUD OF SOMETHING HARD
HITTING A FACE...

...and everything goes calm...

...except Anna... backing into the bedroom doorway...
...@asing the door closed... trying not to make a
sound.

INT. FARMHOUSE/UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Anna locks the door... hurries over to Lucie...
clamps her hand over Lucie’s mouth.

Lucie’s eyes immediately flash open.
ANNA
(whispers)
Someone’s in the house.

Anna helps Lucie up from the bed... to the door...
where we can all hear 0.S. FOOTSTEPS.

They rush to the window... slide it open. Anna
punches out the screen, which tumbles over the eaves.

ANNA (cont’d)
I’1l follow you.

Lucie doesn’t move.

ANNA (cont’d)
C’mon.

Then Anna follows Lucie’s eyes... to the ATTIC DOOR
STRING hanging from the ceiling.

Those 0.S. FOOTSTEPS are coming up the stairs...
fast.

Anna and Lucie reach for the string.

INT. FARMHOUSE/UPSTAIRS HALL - NIGHT
ANGLE ON THE BEDROOM DOOR...

...as the back of a MAN reaches it... shakes the
handle, then takes a step back and...
56.

...KICKS THE DOOR IN.

INT. FARMHOUSE/UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - NIGHT

The Man steps inside... sees the curtain billowing
from that open window.
CUT TO:
INT. FARMHOUSE/ATTIC - NIGHT
Anna and Lucie crouch just above the attic door...
holding their breath as they peer down through a
small crack along the frame...
...watch as the TOP OF THE MAN’S HEAD moves past...
then ANOTHER.
CUT TO:
INT. FARMHOUSE/UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - NIGHT
The Men stand at the open window... one of them
climbs out...
...the other turns to walk past across the room, and
BUMPS HIS HEAD ON THE ATTIC STRING... stops.
CUT TO:
INT. FARMHOUSE/ATTIC - CONTINUOUS
Anna and Lucie stare down through the crack... at the
Man watching that string sway... then reaching up...
grabbing it... holding it still in the air...
thinking.
CUT TO:

INT. FARMHOUSE/UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

The Man jerks the string down... the attic door
opens... the stairs extend.
57.

INT. FARMHOUSE/ATTIC - NIGHT

The Man rises up the stairs... squints around the
dark space... all shadows and boxes.

ANGLE ON ANNA AND LUCIE... lying facedown in the
darkness... squeezed behind an old chest of
children’s toys.

And their hands are clasped together... just like two
frightened little girls.

THE MAN’S FEET ease along the attic’s center

walkway... nearing the Girls.

Anna’s eyes squeeze shut, just hoping this will end.
Lucie’s are wide open... ready to face her monster
again.

But the Man walks past... doesn’t see them... reaches
the far end of the attic... kicks a box over...
empty...

...just as the ATTIC DOOR SLAMS SHUT BEHIND HIM.

INT. FARMHOUSE/UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

Anna and Lucie race out of the room... spot a FIGURE
walking up the stairs, so they duck into a dark
bathroom...

...press themselves against the wall... wait for the
Figure to pass...

...as they hear that ATTIC DOOR SWING DOWN... VOICES
TALKING.

Anna and Lucie charge out of the bathroom... down the
stairs as fast as they can go...

...and the open front door is just ahead of them...
they’re going to make it...

...just a few blind doorways to get past...

...which they do. They’re out the door
58.

EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT
Rain still pouring down, as Anna and Lucie sprint
across the yard.
EXT. FARMHOUSE/ROOF - NIGHT
The Man stands on the eaves... spots the Girls.
MAN
They’re outside!
EXT. CORNFIELD - NIGHT

Anna and Lucie charge into the rows of corn...
running with everything they’ve got.

ANNA
We just have to get to the cars.

They slow down... get their bearings.

And when they slow, we can hear the CHARGE OF
FOOTSTEPS BEHIND THEM.

ANNA (cont’d)
(pulling Lucie)
This way. C’mon.
They take off through the stalks... fighting their
way through... impossible to see where they’re
running...
...but still they run...
...until they burst out of the corn stalks... to
where the road should be... where their cars should
be...

...but instead it’s just a fence. They ran the wrong
way.

ANNA (cont’d)
Oh, God.

RUSTLING FROM BEHIND THEM...
...DARK SHAPES MOVING THROUGH THE CORN.

Anna shoves Lucie down the fence line.
59.

ANNA (cont’d)
Run!

The Girls take off again... full speed along the edge
of the cornfield...

...and now we can see the road ahead of them... their
cars waiting to lead them to their escape.

Anna throws a frightened glance behind them...

...to those CORN STALKS GOING WILD... invisible
shapes tearing through after them.

Anna and Lucie charge on... closer to Anna’s car...
closer...

...finally reaching it. Anna jerks open the driver
door... shoves Lucie in first, then follows behind.

INT. ANNA’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

Anna shakily searches her pockets for the keys... as
Lucie sits beside her... staring out the window...
rocking back and forth.

LUCIE
The monsters are coming.

Anna pulls her keys... shoves it into the ignition...
the ENGINE ROARS TO LIFE...

...Anna throws it into gear...

...just as a HAND COMES SMASHING THROUGH HER
WINDOW... grabs a fistful of hair... jerks Anna’s
head into the glass.

Anna SCREAMS OUT... stomps the gas, but the Man that
hand belongs to is hanging on... pulling so hard that
Anna can’t keep control of the car.

Lucie leans across Anna... tears at the Man’s arm...
tries to pull Anna free...

...as ANOTHER MAN LEAPS ONTO THE WINDSHIELD... starts
pounding the glass... splintering the windshield with
each blow.

And Anna can’t hold onto the wheel any longer... the
car swerves off the dirt road...
60.
...CRASHES INTO A DITCH, sending both Men flying off
the car.

Anna jerks the car into reverse... presses the gas
pedal...

...but the car’s stuck in that muddy ditch... doesn’t
budge.

Anna shoves Lucie out the passenger door.
ANNA
Get out! We have to run!
EXT. ANNA’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

Lucie and Anna scramble out... charge toward the
trees...

...when a FIST SUDDENLY COMES FLYING FROM THE
SHADOWS...

WHAM...
... hits Lucie in the face, almost flipping her

backward. She’s unconscious before she slams to the
ground.

ANNA
No!
The MAN strides over the fallen Anna... grabs Anna by
the hair... slings her to the ground... holds her
there...

...asS SEVERAL OTHER FIGURES APPROACH.

ANNA (cont’d)
Please.

No one says a word.

One of the Men lifts Lucie’s body over his shoulder
Another twists Anna’s arm behind her back... shoves
her toward the house.

INT. FARMHOUSE/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Anna sits on the floor against the couch. Lucie is
still unconscious beside her.
61.
Anna’s eyes scan over the Men flanking the room,
silently watching her.
And Anna’s hands are on the floor behind her...

CUT TO:

POV FROM UNDER THE COUCH...

...as Anna’s fingers stretch... barely touch the
metal of that SHOTGUN.

BACK TO SCENE

As ELEANOR SHAW, (60's), walks in behind them, scans
the scene... studies Anna.

ELEANOR
What’s your name?

ANNA
Anna Davis.

ELEANOR
What are you doing here?

Anna nervously shakes her head.

ELEANOR (cont'd)
Where’s Dr. Patterson?

Anna hesitates, then...

ANNA
He’s dead.

ELEANOR
His family?

Anna nods.

ELEANOR (cont'd)
Did you kill them?

Anna doesn’t answer.
ELEANOR (cont'd)
You’re in a lot of trouble, Anna.
(a beat to let it sink

in)
Did you kill them?
62.

ANNA
No.

ELEANOR
(off Lucie)
Your friend?

ANNA
Who are you?
ELEANOR
What’s her name?
ANNA
I called the police. They’re on

their way.

Eleanor studies Anna a beat, then walks to Lucie...
rolls her over with her foot...

...and her eyes lock on Lucie’s face. Eleanor
smiles.

ELEANOR
Oh, my.

Then she nods to one of the Men...

...who SLAMS THE HANDLE OF A GUN ACROSS THE BACK OF
ANNA’S HEAD... WHAM...

...EVERYTHING GOES BLACK.

Stays black for a long time... too long... just that
dark silence...

...until a sound grows from the darkness... the
RATTLE OF A CHAIN...

...and then LIGHT RETURNS TO THE SCREEN, and we're...

INT. CELL

One of those basement cells Anna explored. But now
she’s CHAINED TO THE WALL... unconscious... both arms
stretched above her head...

...as her eyes flicker back to life...

...see a MAN sitting in a METAL CHAIR BOLTED TO THE
FLOOR... as if he was just waiting for her to awaken.
63.

ANNA
Wait... please.

But the Man isn’t waiting any longer. He switches on
an ELECTRIC RAZOR, then stands... moves toward
Anna...

ANNA (cont’d)
PLEASE!

...shoves the BUZZING RAZOR against Anna’s scalp...
begins shaving off her hair.

Anna struggles, but she’s no match for the chains, as
her hair falls in long clumps to the floor around
her.

The Man finishes... then reaches up, unlocking Anna’s
hands before moving back to the cell door. Anna
yanks her hands free... chases after the Man, but
he’s already out into the hall... has the cell door
closed in her face. She peers out the door’s window.

ANNA (cont’d)
Why are you doing this?

The Man keeps walking away.

ANNA (cont’d)
WHAT DO YOU WANT?!

Anna pounds against the cell door... then everything
falls silent...

...until the 0.S. CLANKING OF CHAINS.

She turns to the sound...

...it’s coming from beyond the room... on the other
side of an adjoining STEEL DOOR, with a small, barred
observation window.

Anna eases toward the CLANKING... to that square...
peers through...

...to the CHAIN RUNNING ACROSS THE FLOOR... to a
chair at the center of the next cell...

...and there’s Lucie strapped to the chair... bound
and gagged... HAIR ALREADY SHAVED CLEAN... struggling
to get free... from the same kind of chair she

escaped years ago. But the chains won’t let her.
64.
ANNA (cont’d)
Lucie!

Lucie stops struggling... her eyes roll up... meet
Anna's...

...and a tear slips down Lucie’s cheek.
ANNA (cont’d)
Oh, God... I’m sorry. I’m so
sorry.
Suddenly a MAN’S FACE appears in the window... cold,
emotionless. He SLIDES THE VENT CLOSED over the
window, blocking Anna’s view.
ANNA (cont’d)
LUCIE!
(banging the door)
LUCIE!

Then what sounds like the ENGINE OF A HAND DRILL
WHIRS TO LIFE...

...Anna falls still... not sure what she’s listening
to.

And then LUCIE SCREAMS... LOUD.

ANNA (cont’d)
LUCIE!

Anna pounds her fists against the door.

ANNA (cont’d)
LEAVE HER ALONE!

The DRILL WHIRS LOUDER... so do Lucie’s SCREAMS.

Anna slides to the floor, cupping her ears... rocking
back and forth, trying not to listen.

ANNA (cont’d)
FUCKING LEAVE HER ALONE!
INT. LUCIE’S CELL - CONTINUOUS
ANGLE ON THE FLOOR BELOW LUCIE’S CHAIR...
...as we listen to LUCIE’S CRIES... the WHIR OF THAT

MOTOR... BLOOD DRIPPING DOWN... hitting the floor
with heavy SPLATS.
65.

EXT. FARMHOUSE/BACKYARD - NIGHT

ANGLE ON THOSE BODIES IN THE HOLE...

...aS Lucie’s distant screams wash over them. It’s
almost as if they’re getting their own revenge.
INT. FARMHOUSE/HALLWAY - NIGHT

Eleanor stands in the hall, watching several Men tear
up the bloodstained carpet... wipe down the walls.

A Man walks up beside her.

MAN
Anna Davis. Student at the
university. Was in Saint Mary’s
the same time as Lucie.

ELEANOR
Any family?
MAN
No.
Eleanor nods... good.
ELEANOR

Then no one will miss her.

INT. ANNA’S CELL - NIGHT

Anna sits on the floor, her face pressed against the
adjoining door. Her eyes bloodshot from crying.

ANNA
Lucie... can you hear me? Are
you there?

No answer from the other side.

ANNA (cont’d)
Please be there. I need you to
be there.

Another long, quiet, beat. And then a SOFT CLANK OF
A CHAIN... as if whoever’s moving it on the other
side doesn’t have much strength. So it isn’t much
but it’s enough for Anna.
66.

Anna closes her eyes... relieved.

ANNA (cont’d)
We’re going to get out. I
promise we are.

Suddenly Anna’s cell door swings open, and TWO MEN
are striding in... fast... too fast for Anna to react
before they have pinned facedown on the ground.

ANNA (cont’d)
No! Get off me!

One of the Men grabs Anna by the back of the neck...
yanks her head straight back... straps a METAL BIT
into her mouth, gagging her.

Then they wrestle her into the chair bolted in the

center of the floor... tighten the cuffs around her
wrists... her ankles.
Anna strains to break free... no chance. So she just

sits there, sucking in air over that bit...

...watching the Men move back out of the cell... stay
gone for a quiet moment, then re-enter, carrying some
kind of ELECTRICAL BOX.

Anna’s eyes are wide with fear, as she watches them
connect ELECTRODES to her legs... arms... each side
of that metal bit.

Anna tries to talk... tries to ask them not to do
whatever it is they’re about to, but it just comes
out as jumbled sounds... sounds these men have heard
a hundred times before.

One of the Men flips a switch on the machine... it
HUMS TO LIFE.

Now Anna knows what’s about to happen... begins
violently shaking her head... trying to shake free...

...asS the Man FLIPS ANOTHER SWITCH... CLICK...
BUZZ...

...and a JOLT OF ELECTRICITY sends Anna’s head
snapping back... her body goes stiff... her jaws are
clamped down on that electricity-filled bit...

...finally, the Man turns the machine off... the
energy dies...
67.
...and Anna’s body falls limp in the chair... GASPING
and drooling over that bit.

MAN
Do you want to live, Anna?

Anna doesn’t answer... can’t answer
MAN (cont’d)
Open your eyes if you want to
live.

A moment passes, then finally, Anna’s eyes flutter
open...

...and the Man hits the switch again... BUZZ.

Anna’s head snaps back... her body convulses... blood
begins to trickle from her nose...

...CLICK... the machine is off again.

The Man lightly smacks Anna’s face, making sure she’s
still conscious.

MAN (cont’d)
Open your eyes if you want to
live, Anna. You’1ll get another

jolt... maybe a dozen more. But
you’11 live.
(beat )
Keep your eyes closed, and you’1l
die now.
Anna’s head slumps on her chest... spit hanging from
her lips... blood from her nose. Her eyes stay

closed.

MAN (cont’d)
Open them, Anna. Open them or
you die.

CU ON ANNA... those eyes... clenched tightly
together.

And we’re waiting for them to open... for Anna to
fight for life, but instead...

...Anna just shakes her head... keeps them squeezed
shut.

The Man taps her face.
68.

MAN (cont’d)
C’mon. Open.

Anna leans her head away from him... keeps them
closed.
ANNA
(barely audible over
the bit)
No more... please.

The Man looks to the doorway, where Eleanor has been
standing, unseen. He shakes his head.

Eleanor turns... walks away.
The Men disconnect the electrodes from Anna... remove
the bit... unclasp the straps, and walk out.

Anna collapses to the floor.

CUT TO:

INT. LUCIE’S CELL - CONTINUOUS
Lucie... strapped into the chair...

...her face is battered and bruised... but her
swollen eyes are WIDE OPEN... staring straight ahead,
as we hear ANNA’S SOFT CRIES from the cell beside us.

EXT. FARMHOUSE - MORNING

The sky’s brightened, but the rain hasn’t let up...
still coming down in buckets.

INT. ANNA’S CELL - MORNING

ANGLE ON THAT ADJOINING DOOR... the window slat
closed, but we can hear an 0.S. SMACKING from behind
it... like a whip hitting flesh. And with each
SMACK, we hear Lucie CRY OUT.

OUR POV DRIFTS DOWN... to the floor...

...where Anna sits against the door... crying...
hearing those same sounds, and just banging the back
of her head against the door in rhythm with the
pounds... trying to make it all go away.
69.

ANNA
Please stop... please stop...
please stop.
EXT. RURAL ROAD - DAY
Anna’s car is out of the ditch... RATTLING as it
follows Lucie’s up the drive to the house... both
disappearing into the barn.

Like they were never there.

INT. BASEMENT AREA - MORNING

Beside that open trap door. Everything’s silent...
until we listen carefully... a distant voice...
Anna’s.

INT. ANNA’S CELL - MORNING

Anna sits on the floor, leaning against that steel
door.

ANNA
(singing softly)
This old man... he played four.
He played...

CUT TO:

INT. LUCIE’S CELL - CONTINUOUS

From across the room behind Lucie... we see her
chained into that chair.

ANNA (0.S.)
...kKnick knack on my door.

TIGHT ON LUCIE... JUST HER LIPS...
...Split... bloodied...
...and mouthing along with Anna’s voice.
ANNA (0.S.) (cont'd)
With a knick knack paddy whack,

give the dog a bone. This old
man...
70.

LUCIE
(barely audible)
...came rolling home.
And the cell door swings wide... the SILHOUETTE OF A
MAN STEPS INSIDE.
INT. ANNA’S CELL - LATER

Anna’s huddled in the corner. The cell door swings
open... THREE MEN enter...

ANNA
No... NO!

Anna flails at them to hold them back... no luck.
They snap Anna’s arms behind her back... handcuff
them... yank her to her feet.

ANNA (cont’d)
Lucie! LUCIE!

One of the Men SHOVES A RAG INTO ANNA’S MOUTH
gagging her, as they lead her out of the cell.
INT. BASEMENT PASSAGE - MORNING

The Men shove Anna down the hall... through a

doorway.

INT. OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

A small room... a desk, few chairs... three walls and
a large observation window.

The window looks into another room... a small chapel-
like room filled with PEOPLE... most in their 60’s or
older... all dressed to the nines... making their way

down church pews.
An altar stands in front of them.

The morning sun pours through a large SKYLIGHT in the
ceiling, casting a heavenly glow over the room.

Eleanor sits behind the desk. The Men pull Anna into
a chair.

ELEANOR
Hello again, Anna.
71.

One of the Men pulls the gag from Anna’s mouth. Anna
immediately SCREAMS TOWARD THE WINDOW.

ANNA
HELP! SOMEBODY!

ELEANOR
They can’t hear you. Not that it
would matter. They’re all aware
of you being here.

ANNA
What I said about calling the
police is true. I did.

ELEANOR
I know. Your abbreviated 911
call is what alerted us. That
and your little excursion
downstairs to find Emily... the
young woman you tried to help.

Eleanor pours a cup of tea... sips it.

ELEANOR (cont'd)
All outgoing calls go through our
system. Without yours, we would
have assumed Dr. Patterson’s work
with Emily was going well...
would have had no reason to pay a
visit last night.

(smiles)

So I owe you my gratitude.
Without you, we never would have
gotten our dear Lucie back

ANNA
I didn’t give her to you.

Eleanor just smiles... shrugs.

ANNA (cont’d)
What do you want with her?

ELEANOR
With Lucie? Her gift of course.
It’s what kept her alive during
the Doctor’s work when she was a
child... gave her the strength to
spend all these years finding
him.

Eleanor pulls a file folder from the desk...
72.

ELEANOR (cont'd)
She’s different than the rest of
us. But you already know that,
don’t you, Anna? You were ready
to die back in your cell...
rather than suffer any longer.
Lucie’s different... stronger

...opens it in front of Anna. PHOTOGRAPHS OF A
HORRIBLY ABUSED YOUNG LUCIE... stretched on a rack...
strapped to that chair... hanging from chains with
hooks piercing her skin.

ELEANOR (cont'd)

What would kill you or I... she
survives... physically, anyway.

(beat )
But mentally... the monsters are
there, aren’t they... they’ve
slipped through the cracks Doctor
Patterson opened.

Eleanor spreads another file... horrific photos of
other WOMEN.

ELEANOR (cont'd)

It’s easy to create a victim.
You lock someone in a dark
room... they begin to suffer.
And then you feed that suffering.
Methodically. Precisely. To
make it last.

(off the files)
The subject goes through a number

of states... then after a while,
their trauma... it opens those
cracks.

(beat )

Does Lucie see things that aren’t
there... things that want to hurt
her?

(off Anna’s silence)
The girl you found... Emily...
for her, it’s spiders... imagined
to be running all over her.
She’d rather tear her own flesh
off than feel their crawl.

Eleanor taps the photos of the Women...
73.

ELEANOR (cont'd)
These are victims... they reach a
point, as you or I would, where
they just break.

...then opens another file... VARIOUS IMAGES OF
TORTURED WOMEN IN THEIR FINAL MOMENTS.

ELEANOR (cont'd)
Martyrs are so much more. And so
very rare. So extraordinary.
Martyrs survive the pain... the
torture... like our Lucie, they
refuse to die. They endure all
the unspeakable sins of the
earth... they give themselves
up... and they transcend their
very being.

Eleanor smacks the first photo... a black and white
image of a WOMAN nearly skinned alive, hanging from a
pole at the center of a mob.

ELEANOR (cont'd)
Long Sheng Province. 1912. This
woman was punished for stealing
food. When this photo was taken
she was still alive. Look at her
eyes.

Eleanor holds the photo to Anna.

ANGLE ON THE PHOTO... the EYES OF THE WOMAN LOOKING
SKYWARD.

Eleanor pulls out another old photo.

ELEANOR (cont'd)

Juliet Lussier. 1945. She was a
grocer that slept with a German.
At the time, that did not sit
well with the French, so she had
to pay.

(taps the photo)
Her eyes. Still alive.

And just like the others, the Woman’s eyes are rolled
upward.

Another photo... a WOMAN IN A HOSPITAL BED.
74.

ELEANOR (cont'd)
Birmingham, 1960. This woman was
in the terminal stages of cancer.
Past the use of morphine. She
was pronounced dead over a dozen
times, and yet she kept living...
for days just in this state.
Again... the eyes.

Then Eleanor starts flipping through the photographs
faster. And as we see the ghastly images flashing in
front of us, we hear Eleanor’s descriptions.

ELEANOR (V.0.) (cont'd)

Beaten to death by her husband...
killed in a head on collision...
leukemia... aids... hours of
suffering underwater. All of
them alive when they were
photographed. All seeing
something in their final breaths.

(beat )
That’s what we’re recreating...
and we’ve gotten close with
others. That’s our hope with
Lucie...

Eleanor pulls the curtain open again.

ELEANOR (cont'd)
...and Emily.

And now we see the crowd of people are on their
knees, staring up at the Woman, Emily...

...or at least what’s left of her

She’s suspended from an executioner’s table... like a
metal crucifix fixed on the altar... a half-dozen IV
TUBES drip blood from her body into buckets...

»..aS a PRIEST WHISPERS PRAYERS beside her.

And while we never get a clear look at the physical
state of her body, it must be horribly gruesome,
because Anna goes to the window... stares out at
Emily in shock...

...then VOMITS.
ELEANOR (cont ’d)

You have to look past the pain,
Anna. Past the human form...
75.

TIGHT ANGLE ON EMILY’S FACE...

...her eyes rolled upward, just like all those
photos.

ELEANOR (V.0.) (cont'd)
...to what’s behind those eyes...
to what she sees... to that place
just beyond life... that which
awaits us all.

ANNA
That’s what this is about? Why
you’ve been torturing and killing
all these years?

ELEANOR
It isn’t torture when there’s a
higher purpose. We’re developing

their gift... expanding their
vision.

ANNA
And these people are here to see
this?

ELEANOR

They’re looking for the answer to
the human race’s greatest
mystery. We all are.

ANNA
(off Emily)
So you murder for the enjoyment.

ELEANOR
(shakes her head)
I sacrifice for knowledge.

Eleanor looks to the Priest... he’s standing just in
front of the Woman... his ear pressed to her lips.
ANNA

Why are you showing me this?

ELEANOR
I’d hoped to send you on your way
with some peace. In appreciation
for your returning Lucie to where
she belonged.
76.

The Priest turns... looks up to Eleanor in the
window... shakes his head. Emily’s eyes are finally
closed.

ELEANOR (cont'd)
Unfortunately, I won’t be able to
give you that, Anna.
A Man reaches in, placing a rag over Anna’s mouth.
Anna struggles for a moment, but whatever’s on that
rag has her unconscious in seconds. She slumps to
the floor.
ELEANOR (cont'd)
Bury her with the family.
(beat )
And have them make the final
preparations for Lucie.
EXT. HOLE - DAY

Anna’s body makes the slow slide to the muddy bottom
of the hole... lands beside the Girl.

The rain pelts Anna’s face.

A moment passes, then the bloodless corpse of Emily
rolls down on top of Anna.

As we hold on them...
.the 0.S. RUMBLE OF THE TRACTOR COMING TO LIFE...

..and Anna’s eyes begin to flutter...

...then a load of dirt drops across her... she
stirs... begins to awaken... focus on where she is...
...inside that hole... with Emily’s blue corpse
sprawled across her.
ANNA
NO!
Anna shoves Emily’s bony frame off... tries to drag

herself to her feet.

ANNA (cont’d)
Stop! Please!
77.

Another load of dirt knocks her back to the bottom...
she fights her way back up... starts scrambling up
the muddy wall of the hole... dragging herself out...

...until a Man swings a shovel across Anna’s head...
THWACK...

...sends her flying back to the bottom...
unconscious... a trickle of blood rolling down her
face...

...aS more dirt pours over her

INT. LUCIE’S CELL - DAY

Lucie’s battered and bruised... barely conscious, as
she sits slumped over in that chair.

And we hold on Lucie’s face, as we hear a voice...

YOUNG ANNA (V.0.)
Lucie. I’m here. I’ve got you.

YOUNG LUCIE (V.0.)
I don’t want to be scared.

And as we hear the Young Lucie’s words, we see
Lucie’s lips barely moving... like she’s repeating
them to herself.

YOUNG ANNA (V.0.)
You don’t have to be. Not
anymore.

YOUNG LUCIE (V.0.)
How do I make it go away?

YOUNG ANNA (V.0.)
You just pretend the monsters
aren’t real.

YOUNG LUCIE (V.0.)
Will you help me?

YOUNG ANNA (V.0.)
Yes. Always.

And Lucie’s lips might even curl into the slightest
of smiles at those words...

...until a WOMAN’S HAND touches Lucie’s cheek...
78.

...and Lucie sees Eleanor crouched in front of her...
fear fills Lucie’s eyes... the monsters are real.

Eleanor gently runs a wet cloth over Lucie’s face...
cleaning her wounds.

ELEANOR
You’re going to be all right,
Lucie. It’s almost over now.
Just one more stage, then all the
suffering will be done.

Eleanor softly kisses Lucie’s head.

ELEANOR (cont'd)
I’m so glad you came back to us.

Two Men wheel a gurney into the cell.
ELEANOR (cont'd)
It’s all going to be fine,
sweetheart.
Eleanor steps back... lets them lift Lucie up... drop
her onto the gurney.

INT. BASEMENT PASSAGE - DAY

The Men push the gurney down the corridor, its wheels
SQUEAKING as it rolls.

They turn into a room, where are surgical table rests
at the center of a large metal ring.

A DOCTOR, wearing a mask and scrubs stands waiting.

INT. OPERATING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The Men guide the gurney to the table... lift Lucie
onto the table, then extend her arms and legs into
CLAMPS...

»..attach them around wrists and ankles.

Then they release a pin... let the ring rotate,
slowly flipping the table over until Lucie is facing
the floor.

The Doctor uses a pair of scissors to snip down the
back of Lucie’s gown. It separates... falls to the
floor.
79.

The Men walk out... past Eleanor, standing in the
doorway, watching.

ELEANOR
Exactly as Doctor Patterson would
have done it.

The Doctor nods, and Eleanor turns... walks down the
hall.

EXT. FARMHOUSE/BACKYARD - DAY

Where that hole once was... now a fresh stretch of
soft, flat dirt.

No hint those bodies below ever existed.

INT. UNDERGROUND DRAINAGE PIPE - DAY

One of those two foot metal pipes... filled with
muck... branches... leaves... filth. One end is
walled up with dirt...

...until suddenly a HAND BURSTS THROUGH... claws the
dirt away so that a face... ANNA’S FACE... can
squeeze in... GASP FOR OXYGEN.

And Anna’s face is covered in a blend of blood and
dirt... now she looks more monster than human.

She frantically pulls at the dirt and rocks... drags
herself into the pipe...

...just lies there, crying. Then she starts
crawling... dragging herself along the length of
round pipe... pushing through the sludge... dead
rodents.

And right now, Anna’s eyes are wide open... she’s
fighting to live.

EXT. DRAINAGE DITCH - DAY

The dark skies still gushing rain... a stream of
overflow water runs out of a pipe... pours into the
ditch.

And then Anna appears... and the pipe pours her
out... she falls... slides to the wet bottom, and
pulls herself back up...
80.

...just high enough to peer over the edge... to open
fields... her escape... in one direction... and the
Farmhouse a few hundred yards away in the other

Anna climbs out... charges toward the house, veering
into the cover of the cornfield.

EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY

The Man that smashed that shovel across Anna’s head
walks out the front door... lifts his coat collar
above his head to protect himself from the rain...

...as THAT SAME SHOVEL COMES SWINGING THROUGH THE
AIR...

...but it’s coming POINT FIRST...

..+THWACK...

...as the tip of the shovel buries in the Man’s
neck... he drops to the porch steps... looks up at
Anna standing over him...

...the blood and muck running down her face like
rivers.

That Creature Lucie was so scared of... that’s Anna
now.

She jams the shovel deeper into the Man... SNAPS THE
HANDLE... makes sure he’s dead...

...and continues up into the house.

INT. FARMHOUSE/ENTRY - DAY

One of the Men that electrocuted Anna stands in the
entry... turns to the front door as it opens...

...his own kind of shock when he sees it’s Anna...
coming straight toward him.

MAN
How the...

And that’s all he gets out before Anna has that
JAGGED SHOVEL HANDLE STABBED THROUGH HIS CHEST.
81.

The Man drops to his knees... blood spurts from his
lips. He makes a grab for Anna... clamps around her
wrist...

...but he’s already dead. His hand slides off... he

crumbles forward... falls until the other end of the
shovel handle catches... holds him propped in the
air.

INT. FARMHOUSE/LAUNDRY ROOM - DAY

Another Man steps out of the hidden doorway.

INT. FARMHOUSE/HALLWAY - DAY

The Man walks out of the laundry room... strides down
the hall...

... his steps slowing, as he sees the DEAD MAN leaning
on the end of that wooden shovel handle.

The Man reaches under his jacket... pulls out a
KNIFE... eases toward the fallen Man... looks to the
open door...

MAN
Walker?

...but Walker’s the guy with the other end of that
shovel in his neck, so he doesn’t answer

And our Man is so focused on what’s in front of him,
that he doesn’t see ANNA CLOSING IN FROM BEHIND...

»..an IRON RAISED HIGH OVER HER HEAD.

But the Man must sense something, because he turns...
...just as Anna SWINGS... WHAM...

...hits the Man across the side of the head... sends

him flying to the floor... the knife falling from his
hand.

But that knife wouldn’t help him now anyway, because

Anna pounces... is on top of him, SMASHING THAT IRON

INTO HIS FACE OVER AND OVER...

.».THWACK... THWACK... THWACK...
82.
...the iron more blood-covered each time she pulls it
back to swing again.
The attack finally ends, and Anna just stands over
him a moment, before dropping the iron... searching
his pockets... pulling out a SET OF KEYS.
INT. FARMHOUSE/LIVING ROOM - DAY
Anna walks in... flips the couch over, revealing that
shotgun and shells underneath.
INT. BASEMENT PASSAGE - DAY

As that ladder comes RATTLING DOWN... slams to the
concrete floor...

...and Anna descends toward us.

INT. BASEMENT PASSAGE - DAY

Anna moves down the hall... stops at the first cell
door... peers in the window.
ANNA
Lucie.

Nothing, so Anna continues on...
...to the next cell...

ANNA (cont’d)
Lucie.

No answer. But Anna spots a FIGURE IN ONE OF THOSE
CHAIRS...

...the back of a WOMAN in a blood-stained gown,
facing the back wall... her head’s been shaved, and
we can’t see her face...

...but we’re still sure it’s Lucie.

Anna unlocks the cell door... rushes in.

INT. CELL - CONTINUOUS

Anna hurries as fast as her weakening body will let
her...
83.
ANNA
Lucie, it’s me.

...moves around to the front of Lucie... reaches for
her...

...and sees that it’s JUST A WOMAN... half-dead...
blank eyes. She isn’t chained to the chair... she’s
just sitting there... beaten down... to weak to move.
Anna just backs away, shaking her head.

ANNA (cont’d)
I’m sorry. I can’t help you.

Anna spins... rushes out of the cell.

INT. LUCIE’S CELL - DAY

A WOMAN mops Lucie’s blood from the floor... looks
up...

...and there’s Anna in the cell doorway, shotgun
aimed.

ANNA
Where is she?

The Woman manages to shake her head, but that’s it.

ANNA (cont’d)
Where?

WOMAN
I just do what they tell me. I
didn’t want them to...
BOOM...

...the shotgun blast sends the Woman flying back into
the cell wall.

She slides dead to the floor.

INT. BASEMENT PASSAGE - CONTINUOUS
Anna turns... strides down the corridor...
...aS a MAN rushes out, 9mm already aimed... POP...

...his shot hits Anna in the shoulder...
84.

...BOOM...

...Anna’s blast sprays his chest. Her pace never
slows as she walks past him.

And right now, Anna looks just like Lucie did walking
through the farmhouse that morning... killing
everyone... doing what she had to do.

Anna moves past another OPEN CELL...

...asS a MAN steps out right beside her... presses his
9mm against the side of her head.

MAN
Put it down.

Anna just stands there a moment... we can almost see
her mind working. Then she slowly turns toward the
Man...

...until the barrel of that gun is pressed right
between her eyes... those eyes that are staring back
at the Man...

...the same Man that sent all those volts through her
earlier... who told her to open her eyes for him.

They’re open now.

And the Man sees it... knows this is a different
Anna...

...So0 his finger tightens on the trigger...

...just as an EMACIATED WOMAN LEAPS FROM THE SHADOWS
BEHIND THE MAN.

She’s as much monster as woman... still chained, but
the length allows her to reach the Man... wrap the
chains around his throat, and yank him back to the
ground.

He sends his off-balance shot just past Anna’s

head... into the ceiling.

And the Emaciated Woman tears into him with her
claws... ripping into his flesh.

He turns the gun on her... is ready to shoot...

...WHACK...
85.

...Anna slams the butt of that shotgun into his
head... cracks his skull... leaves him only conscious
enough to SCREAM, as the crazed Woman shreds him.
Anna lifts his 9mm... slides it into her belt, and
continues on, as the Woman finishes the job behind
her.

She reaches the doorway to that operating room...

...sees the empty surgical table where Lucie once
laid.

There’s blood all over the floor beneath it.

Anna just stares at it... the shotgun drops to her
side... tears fill her eyes...

...when suddenly the Doctor springs from inside the
room... slices a scalpel down Anna’s arm.

Anna jams the shotgun against him... CLICK... EMPTY.

The Doctor tackles Anna... drives her back against
the wall... makes another slash with the scalpel.

Anna CRIES OUT... shoves him away...
...but he raises the scalpel for another blow...

...just as Anna pulls the 9mm from her belt... POP...
pierces the Doctor’s wrist...

...the scalpel falls away...
»POP... POP...

...the next shots finish him off. He drops across
Anna’s legs.

Anna sits there a moment... jagged lines of blood
seep from her wounds... spread across her shirt.

Finally, she kicks free... pulls herself back to her
feet, and continues down the passage.

ANNA
Lucie!

Anna limps down the hall... blood drips from the
bottom of her pants... leaving a red trail behind.
86.

INT. OFFICE - DAY
ANGLE ON A TREMBLING HAND...
...Shakily lighting a cigarette...

...raising it to her lips...

.. ELEANOR...
...Standing at that window, staring out. She seems
anxious... a little scared even.

ELEANOR

This is the one.

And we don’t know what she’s looking at yet... just
that she can’t take her eyes off whatever it is.

And a long beat passes before a 9mm slides into
frame...

...presses against Eleanor’s temple.
And then we see Anna, holding the gun.

ANNA
Where’s Lucie.

Eleanor doesn’t even acknowledge that gun... just
keeps staring straight ahead.

ELEANOR
She has to be.

ANNA
Where is she?

Then Eleanor turns her head toward Anna... until the
gun is centered between her eyes.

ELEANOR
She has to be.

That’s enough for Anna to let her eyes drift from her
target... out that office window...

...over the small crowd kneeling toward...
...SOMETHING WE DON’T SEE...

... because instead we’re back on Anna...
87.

...as first confusion, then pain flows over her...
...and she lets the gun fall to her side...
ANNA
(softly)
No... no...

Then Anna charges out of the office.

INT. CHAPEL - DAY

The Priest stands on the altar, in front of that
metal crucifix.

We can just make out what looks like a SKINLESS HAND
extended on the cross.

The room is deathly silent... just the WHISPERED
PRAYERS OF THE PRIEST...

...until the door swings open.

ANNA
GET AWAY FROM HER!

And everyone spins to Anna... dragging her blood-
soaked form into the room, that 9mm aimed right at
the Priest.

PRIEST
She’s there. She sees.

POP...

...Anna’s shot SHATTERS A MIRROR BEHIND THE ALTAR.
...the PEOPLE SQUIRM...

...the Priest backs away.

Anna steps up onto the altar... eyes filled with
tears as she stares at what we still can’t see...

...but it must be horrible, because ANNA SCREAMS...

...one of those tear your heart out kind of screams
that uses all of what little strength she has left.

She raises that gun back at the Priest.
88.

ANNA
Take her down.
PRIEST
It could push her past the...
ANNA
TAKE HER DOWN!
The Priest eyes Anna and her gun... hits a button on
the altar... the metal cross begins to slowly tilt
backward...

...we get another QUICK FLASH of what must be Lucie’s
leg... now just exposed tendons and ligaments.

ELEANOR (0.S.)
You’11 let her die in vain.

Anna spins... sees Eleanor walking toward them.
ELEANOR (cont'd)
All of her pain will have been
for nothing.

Anna shakily aims that 9mm at Eleanor

ANNA
Stay away from her.
The crucifix moans to a halt... lays flat like a
table...
...and Anna moves to it... lays a cloth from the

altar over Lucie’s body...

...as she holds that gun on Eleanor... unlatches Anna
from the crucifix.

ELEANOR
Listen to me, Anna. She knows
the answer the rest of the world
has fought countless wars...
destroyed civilizations over.
(beat )
Don’t waste her suffering.

POP...

...Anna sends a shot past Eleanor... keeping her
back.

Then Anna looks back to Lucie... leans close...
89.

...and for the first time, we see Lucie’s face...
nothing like the rest of her body... it’s un-
bloodied... peaceful... with HER EYES ROLLED
UPWARD... just like all those photographs.

ANNA
I’m sorry I didn’t believe. I’m
so sorry.
(beat )

I won’t leave you again. I
promise I won’t ever leave.

Anna follows Lucie’s eyes... looking up through that
skylight...

...to the clouds dotting the sky. And as Anna stares
up at them.

YOUNG LUCIE (V.0.)
I wish I could ride a cloud. Let
it take me wherever I wanted.

YOUNG ANNA (V.0.)
Where would you want to go?

We can almost see the little girl again in Anna’s
face, as a tear slips down her cheek...

...and she TIGHTENS HER GRIP ON THE GUN...

ANNA
Wherever you go.

...and we’re not sure what she’s going to do next
when suddenly...

...we notice LUCIE’S LIPS MOVE... just barely.

PRIEST
She’s trying to speak!

Anna stares at Lucie’s lips...

...and the Priest is right... Lucie’s lips keep
moving... the FAINTEST WHISPER...

...SO Anna leans closer.
Eleanor rushes toward them.

ELEANOR
WHAT IS SHE SAYING?!
90.

Anna holds that gun on Eleanor.

ANNA
Stay back!

And as Anna keeps Eleanor away with the gun, she
presses her ear to Lucie’s lips...

...listens...

...words the rest of us can’t hear.

But whatever they are, they stun Anna... like she
just heard something she can’t comprehend...
something extraordinary... not good... not bad...

...just unbelievably powerful.

She rises back up, staring at Lucie as she lets the
gun fall to her side... drop to the floor...

...giving Eleanor the chance to hurry to Lucie
herself... to lean close... and just like with Anna,
Eleanor’s the only one that can hear Lucie’s WHISPER.

And Jesus... whatever it is that Lucie said has the

same effect on Eleanor.

She slowly straightens... backs away from Lucie.
PRIEST

She was there, wasn’t she? In
His kingdom.

The People stare in awe... just waiting for Eleanor
to reveal Lucie’s secret. The one they’ve all been
waiting for.

But Eleanor doesn’t speak... can’t speak.

Neither can Anna. All she can do is gently take
Lucie in her arms... ease her off the table.

And the battle has taken all of Anna’s strength...
she’s got nothing left...

...S80 they sink to the altar together...

...just sit there... Anna holding Lucie in her arms,
just the way she used to.
91.

PRIEST (cont’d)
(to Eleanor)
Madame?

Eleanor gazes at the Priest a beat, then leans
down... takes the 9mm from the floor.

Anna’s lost eyes roll up... finally grasp the fact
that Eleanor is holding the gun.

ELEANOR
You heard her?

Anna doesn’t answer... just stares back at Eleanor...
and it’s clear they both heard Lucie’s words.

Then Eleanor raises the gun...

...she’s going to finish Anna off right here... keep
Lucie’s words a secret.

But the gun’s aim doesn’t stop on Anna... the barrel
keeps rising...

...until it’s slid inside Eleanor’s own mouth.

ON ANNA... as the GUNSHOT EXPLODES... she barely
flinches.

The PEOPLE SCREAM... a sudden panic...
...some shove their way to the exits...
...others drop to their knees... begin praying.

The Priest crumbles to the altar, making the Sign Of
The Cross over himself.

Anna looks down at Lucie... watches Lucie’s eyes
finally close.

Her pain is finally over.

PRIEST
What happens next?
Anna’s eyes slowly rise to the Priest... stare back
at him...
...and we’re waiting for Anna to answer him... to let

us all in on this incredible secret.
92.
She looks past the Priest... to the kneeling flock
all waiting with us.
And as we wait, we tighten on Anna’s face... just
like when she was little, and the Detective asked
about Lucie’s monsters...

...tightening closer... closer...

...to the point we’re all sure we’re about to get our
answer... then...

...WE SLAM TO BLACK.

THE END
