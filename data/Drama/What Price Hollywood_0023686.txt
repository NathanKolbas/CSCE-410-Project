HOLLYWOOD MERRY~-GO -ROUND
Adapted from an Original Story
by

Adela Rogers St. Johns

FADE IN

For main title end exposure of credits, there is a
background of carousel music. The series of quick
dissolves shows trick shots of each of the principal
characters in the story. It is as though they are
riding a gigantic merry-go-round. Double~exposures
show a background formed by various Hollywood places,
photographic studies of Hollywood. In the foreground
is each character riding on @ merry~go~round animal.
The only character not on @ horse, camel, etc., is
the girl, Mary Evans. She, too, is on the Hollywood
Merry-Go-Round, but she is riding in a Cinderella
pumpkin coach, with two rats for horses.

CAROUSEL MUSIC (Some established tune that
keeps the mood of the picture, such
as "I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles")

(Note: . If desired, the name of each character may
be used super~imposed on the scene depicting the
persons pertinent to the play; thus introducing them)

‘got a story of my own. It's my own brain

for fifteen years. It probably won't make
a dime, but it's an artistic triumph. It's
about an old general. In Russia.

(he demonstrates as he talks)
It's the night of the grand court ball.
Splashes of color. lIiusic. Jewels.
Throbbing pulses. They are dancing a
minuet. The old general is stooped and he
earries a long cane as he dances with the
duchess. Nobody would know he was the
famous general of all Russia. Then
suddenly a messenger throws open the door.
He calls out, as he holds a document, a
sealed document. ‘a letter from the
ezarina." The music stops. The general
reads the letter. He takes his cane like a
sword. He is not stooped now. He is the
great general who is left behind ... TI
forgot to tell you ... because he is too
old. I told the ending first, it was so
dramatic. Never mind. He takes his cane
and gives orders. ‘You go to Greece." "You
take charge of the Turkish front." "You do
this" and "You do that." How does it sound
