And Those Who Served With Him

They Live With Us
It was an act of love. Those men on
the line were my family, my home.
They were closer to me than I can
say, closer than my friends had
been or ever would be. They had
never let me down, and I could
never do it to them. I had to be
with them, rather than let them
down and me live with the knowledge
that I might have saved them. Men,
I now know, do not fight for flag
or country, for the Marine Corps or
glory or any other abstraction.
They fight for one another. Any man
in combat who lacks comrades who
will die for him, or for whom he is
willing to die, is not a man at
all. He is truly damned.

William Manchester

the journalist

writing in Goodbye Darkness about
his experience on Guadalcanal.
(Like Fife, he walked away from the
safety of a hospital in a secure
area to return to his company in

combat. )

EXT. A WARSHIP AT SEA - 1942 - DAY

A young Admiral receives an encoded message from a
radiotelegraph and interprets it for a group of Army
commanders aboard a warship. An Army division must be
diverted to support the Marines on Guadalcanal, an island
which none of them is familiar with but which it appears is
of critical importance in maintaining the supply route
between the United States and Australia now in the first year
of the war. The Army commanders tell him that two divisions
are available; each is already at sea. The choice of which to
deploy is his and, after a few seconds of hesitation, he
makes it. He asks them to return to him some day in the
future and to tell him, since he must remain far from the
fighting, about their experience in the ordeal to come.
Soldiers in the Civil war,.he says, spoke of “seeing the
Elephant”: it was as though in combat a strange, awesome
creature would appear, whose features one could not quite
describe to anyone who had not seen it for himself. He would
like to hear from them what this Elephant is.

INT. BRIG - DAWN

FIRST SGT. WELSH sits in the brig of a warship, talking with
PFC WITT, a young man from Breathitt County, Kentucky, a
regular and formerly a regimental boxer.

WELSH
I can put you up for a court-
martial, or I can give you non-
judicial punishment. Your choice,
up or down. It's a felony offense
to strike an officer -- that
includes an NCO.

WITT
It ain't right.

WELSH
We're going to send you to a place
where you learn or you don't.
They're going to shape you up.

WITT
What did the Captain say?

WELSH
Captain don't want you. Company
don't want you.
WITT
You fixed it that way.

WELSH

You were gambling. You got mad
because you lost. I've read your
record. You been a loser all your
life. You don't fool me. You'll
never amount to nothing.

(after a pause)
You hit an NCO from another unit
in a war zone. Normally you'd go to

Leavenworth.
WITT
Baloney!
WELSH

This isn't a normal situation. I
worked a deal. Consider yourself
lucky. If this got to Battalion,
you'd be court-martialed. Maybe

hanged.

WITT
Nonsense.

WELSH
A felony offense, in a war zone.
I've had trouble with you since
Hawaii. You're a bad soldier. You'd
let us down.

Welsh leaves. The steel door crashes shut behind him. witt
turns to the prisoner in the next cell, a man named HOKE.

HOKE
(after a silence)
What a jerk!

WITT
Yeah. Partly he's right, though...
I screwed up my life. I thowed away
my pearl.

EXT. DECK OF TRANSPORT

A LEGEND appears over a DISTANT VIEW of a lovely South
Pacific island: “Guadalcanal, 9 November 1942.” Two transport
ships of the U.S. Navy have sneaked up from the south in the
first graying flush of dawn to deliver fresh reinforcement
troops.
7.

For their crews, this is a routine mission and one they know
well; but to the men in the hold, the trip is neither routine
nor known.

INT. SECOND FORWARD HOLD - DAWN

CORPORAL FIFE, the orderly room clerk, sits against a
bulkhead, sick with fear. Beads of moisture cover the steel
walls. The fighting men of C-for-Charlie Company pick their
wet shirts loose from their armpits, look at their watches
and wait impatiently. The bunks are covered with their gear;
there is nowhere to sit except in the companionways. On
Fife's right, PVTS MAZZI and TILLS clutch their knees.

MAZZI
You think we'll catch a fucking air
raid?

TILLS

How the hell do I know? All I know,
them crew guys said they din’t
catch no air raid last time they
made this run. On the other hand,
time before last they almost got
blew up. What do you want me to
tell you?

MAZZI
You're a big help, Tills: nothin’
Tell me nothin’. I'll tell you
somethin’. We're sittin’ out here
on this ocean like a couple fucking
ducks in these here boats, that’s
what.

TILLS
I already know that.

MAZZI
Yeah? Well, brood on it, Tills.
Brood on it.

In one place a blackjack game has been started. Elsewhere
little knots of men have formed and stand or sit talking
earnestly to each other with widened eyes while hardly
hearing what is said. Every so often an LCI, caught wrong on
a wave, BANGS against the hull and REVERBERATES through the
closed space of the dim hold, an anguished STEEL CRY. On
Fife's left, PRIVATE FIRST CLASS DOLL is standing with
CORPORAL QUEEN, a huge, amiable Texan.
QUEEN
Well, we'll soon know what it feels
like.

GORDON
What what feels like?

QUEEN
To be shot at.

DOLL
Hell, I've been shot at. Hell
ain't you, Queen?

GORDON
I only just hope there aren't any
planes today. That's all.

DOLL
Well, I reckon if I'm goin’a get me
that pistol, I better get with it
Those fucks in the next compartment
ought be about nervous enough by
now. Anybody want to come along?

QUEEN
You'll do better on your own.

Doll stops in front of Mazzi and Tills. He nods at the

crowded portholes.

DOLL
Ain't you watchin’ the fun?
MAZZI
Ain't interested.
DOLL
I guess it is pretty crowded.
MAZZI
Wouldn't be interested if it
wadn't.
DOLL
I'm on my way to get me that
pistol.
MAZZI

Yeah? Well, have fun.

TILLS
Yeah; have fun.
DOLL
You guys'll wish you had one, once
we get ashore, and run into some of
them Samurai sabers.

MAZZI
All I want is to get ashore. And
off of this fat sitting fucking
duck we all sittin' on out here on
this flat water.

TILLS
Hey, Doll, you get around. You
think we're liable to catch an air
raid?

DOLL
How the fucking hell would I know?
We might, we might not.

MAZZI
Thanks.

TILLS
Prob'ly they'll wait to hit us at
the beach.

DOLL
(ignoring Tills)
If we do, we do. What's the matter?
You scared, Mazzi?

MAZZI
Scared? ‘Course I ain't scared! Are
you?

DOLL
No.

MAZZI

Okay then. Shut up.

Doll throws back his head and laughs and steps out through
the bulkhead.

MAZZI
That guy just ain't hep. He’s as
unhep as a box.

TILLS
You think he'll get a pistol?
10.

MAZZI
Hell no, he won't get no pistol.

TILLS
Right now, I couldn't care less.
All I want is to get off this
fucking boat here.

MAZZI
Well, you ain't by yourself, Tills.
All I know, I never bargained for
nothin’ like this when I signed up
in this man's Army back in the
Bronx before the war. How did I
know they was gonna be a fucking
war, hanh? Answer me that.

TILLS
You tell me. You're the hep
character around here, Mazzi.

MAZZI
All I know, old Charlie Company
always gets screwed. Always. And I
can tell you whose fault it is.
Bugger Stein's, that's who. First
he gets us stuck off on this boat
clean away from our own outfit
where we don't know a fucking soul.
Then he gets us stuck way down in
fourth pace on the list to get off
this son of a bitch.

At the other end of the companionway, CAPT. JAMES STEIN talks
privately with First Sergeant Welsh.

STEIN
I think our outfit looks pretty
capable, pretty solid, don't you
Sergeant?

Welsh grins at him insolently. There is a look of dark
foreboding that never leaves his face, even when he grins.

WELSH
Yeah -- for a bunch of slobs about
to get their ass shot off.

Stein does not answer him. Welsh is mad. He is insane, Truly
a madman, and Stein never has understood him. He has no
respect for anything or anybody . But it doesn't really
matter. Stein can afford to overlook his impertinences
because he is so good at his job.
11.

STEIN
Hello, Doll. How's it going?
Everything okay? Feeling a little

nervous?
DOLL
(warily)
No, sir.

Stein nods, dismissing him. Doll salutes and goes on out
through the watertight door, wondering what Stein meant.

INT. FORWARD HOLD - DAWN

Furious, Doll makes his way through the forward hold. He does
not know how much time he still has. Then, suddenly, he sees
a .45 hanging from the end of a bed frame. Three bunks away a
group of men clusters around a nervous crap game. He has to
make his move now, time is running out. He lifts the pistol
off the bunk frame and buckles it around his waist.

VOICES
Hey, you! Hey, soldier!

Doll turns around to see two men, one a PRIVATE and one a
SERGEANT, coming toward him. Will they turn him in?

PRIVATE (DRAKE)
That's my pistol you're wearin’,
soldier.

SERGEANT (KARL)
He saw you take it off the bunk. So
don't try to lie out of it,
soldier.

Doll forces a slow, cynical grin to spread across his face.
Slowly he undoes the belt and passes it over.

DOLL
How long you been in the Army,
mack? You ought know better than to
leave your gear layin' around like
that. You might lose it someday.

Both men stare back at him, their eyes widening slightly as
the new idea, new attitude, replaces their own of righteous
indignation.

SERGEANT (MARL)
Well, you better not have such
sticky fingers, soldier.
12.

DOLL
Anything layin' around out in the
open that loose, is fair game to
me. And to any other soldier. Tell
your boy he oughtn't to tempt
people so much.

SERGEANT (MARL)
Hear that, Drake? You better take
better care of your gear.

DOLL
Yeah. He sure better. Or he won't
have it long.

INT. LOWER FORWARD HOLD - DAWN

Outside, in the hatchway area, Doll stops and laughs. It was
all one big lie! Entering the bunk area on the deck above
everything works perfectly for him. On a field pack at the
edge of the companionway he sees not one but two pistols.
There is not a man in this entire end of the bunk area. That
is all there is to it. All Doll has to do is step over, pick
up one of the pistols and put it on.

INT. SECOND FORWARD HOLD - DAWN

Doll returns to C-for-Charlie in the second forward hold.
Tills, Mazzi and Fife have not moved. Doll steps up with his
hands on his hips, his right one resting on the pistol.

MAZZI
Hello, lover-boy. Where you been?

DOLL
Around... Well, what do you think?

MAZZI
Think of what?

DOLL
Nothin'. The war.

He turns on his heel and goes on inside among the bunks.

TILLS
Well, what do you say now, hep guy?

MAZZI
Just what I fucking said before.
The guy's a jerkoff.
13.

TILLS
He's got a pistol.
MAZZI
So he's a jerkoff with a pistol.
TILLS
While you're a hep guy, without a
pistol.
MAZZI

That's right. What's a fucking
pistol? Leave it, Tills; leave it
You wanna do somethin', go do
somethin'.

TILLS
I think I will.

MESS SERGEANT STORM has gathered his cooks for a bull
session.

WELSH
(grinning crazily)
What are you doing with that
fucking pistol, Doll?

DOLL
What pistol?

WELSH
This pistol.

Welsh grabs the pistol on Doll's hip and, with it, pulls Doll
slowly forward and slowly, the grin fades from Welsh's face.

DOLL
Well, I...

WELSH
And what if somebody comes around
here to Capt. Stein and wants to
search this outfit for a stolen
pistol? 'Ey? Have you ever thought
of that? And what if I then
knowin' who had it, was forced to
tell Bugger Stein where it was?
Huh? Have you thought of that, too?

DOLL
Would you do that, Top?
14.

WELSH
You bet your sweet ass I would!

Welsh bellows it with startling suddenness right into his
face. The CRASH of the landing craft against the hull
continues, relentless and unnerving.

DOLL
Well -- Do you think anybody’11
come around?

WELSH
No! I don't!

Then, as slowly as it disappeared, the sly, ominous grin
comes back over the sergeant's face. He lets Doll go and, all
in the same motion, flings the holstered pistol away from
him.

WELSH
Clean it. It's prob'ly dirty. Any
man'd leave it layin' around's a
fuckass soldier anyway.

Wherever his glance falls, the nearby men beneath it stir
uneasily and drop their eyes and fall to doing something:
adjusting a strap, checking a tie-rope, rubbing a riflestock.

INT. SECOND FORWARD HOLD - DAWN

Fife sits to Bell's right, sunk in melancholy. BELL is a
strong, quiet-voiced private.

FIFE
(after a pause)
I read in your 201 file you were an
officer before the war.

SELL
You told anybody else?

FIFE
No. How'd you end up a private?

BELL
Because of my wife. I was in the
Corps of Engineers, we'd never been
separated before, not even for a
night. I took it for four months
and then I quit. Resigned.
15.

FIFE
Yeah?

BELL
They sent me back to the States.
They told me I'd never get another
commission, they said they'd see to
it that I got drafted, and that I'd
for damn sure be in the Infantry.
We had eight months together.

FIFE
Why, the sons of bitches! Where is
she now?

BELL

Home. With her folks. How old are
you, Fife?

FIFE
Twenty-two.

BELL
Well, I'm thirty.

FIFE
Why don't you want any of the guys
to know?

BELL
Enlisted men don't like officers...
The only reason I've told you is so
you'll know why I don't want it
mentioned.

WELSH
(appearing suddenly)
All right, fuckface! Where's that
platoon roster I told you to fix up
for me?

FIFE
(indignantly)
I already did it! I made it up and
turned it in to you, Welsh.

WELSH
You what! You did no such fucking
thing, Fife. I don't have it, do I?
16.

INT. LATRINE - DAWN

He signals Fife to follow him around a corner into the
latrine. There he backs Fife up against the wall.

WELSH
You think you're a big grown-up
man, but you're gust a punk kid --
a coward. There’s nowhere you can
run now. You're in a box. A moving
box. You've never learned that your
life, and you -- they don't mean a
goddamned thing to the world, and
they never will.

INT. SECOND FORWARD HOLD - DAWN

Suddenly the KLAXON HORN goes off, RESOUNDING through the
CLANGING, overheated hold and deafening everybody -- an
immense sound that causes everyone to jump, even Welsh.

WELSH
Get your gear and shape up!

NONCOMS (0.S.)
All right! Off and on! Drop your
cocks and grab your socks!

Everybody struggles into their equipment. Bulging in all
directions, they find the stairs difficult to navigate.

DALE (2ND COOK)
Geez, my ass is draggin’. All this
gear.

STORM
Mor’n your ass‘ll be draggin’ soon.

EXT. DECK OF TRANSPORT - DAY

They emerge at last into the sunshine and fresh sea air on
deck. Looking up to the bridge, Capt. Stein sees LT. COL.
GORDON TALL, the Battalion Commander. They exchange salute.

By squads and by platoon, the men go over the side and
clamber down the four-story-high side of the ship on the nets
and into the chain of LCIs that shuttle back and forth from
the shore.
17.

EXT. ABOARD MOVING LCI - DAY
The ASST. PILOT salutes them in best naval officer style.

ASST. PILOT
Well, look what we got here. Your
outfit's lucky. Old Nippy'1ll be
comin' along in about fifteen
minutes.

TILLS
How do you know?

ASST. PILOT
Just got news from the airstrip.
Transports must've been spotted.
You're getting off just ahead of
time. You're lucky.

Fife grabs the gunnel to keep his balance in the jouncing,
swaying craft, and looks back at the dwindling ship.

WELD
But won't the fighter planes --

ASST. PILOT
They always get some of them. But
some always get through. Jerk the
lead!

Ahead, Doll sees the shore and sand beach and coco palms
gradually coming closer. Beyond them lies the dark green band
of jungle, with the mass and power of the mountains rising
behind it to rocky peaks.

PILOT
Grab holt and prepare to land!
Everybody out! No transfer slips!

EXT. GUADALCANAL SHORE - DAY

Suddenly, they are stumbling through the water. The ramp is
already rising, as the craft goes into reverse and pulls back
out to go for another load. Fife expects some protest, some
visible sign of enemy resistance, but not a shot is fired.

They dart across the beach to the line of coco palms,
thrashing dryly in the mid-morning breeze. There they rest
waiting for orders from Battalion. Didn't the Army know there
were no Japanese here?
18.

If they failed to realize this, what else don't they know?
Two SCOUTS come scampering out of the grove up ahead and
report to Capt. Stein.

FIRST SCOUT
We went in about a mile, sir.
Didn't find nothing. Some empty oil
drums. A burned spot. Hadn't nobody
been around there for at least a
week.

Stein nods, puzzled. Suddenly a CRY goes up. One SOLDIER
flings up an arm and yells, "There they are!" The CRY is
taken up all up and down the beach.

High up in the sun-bright sky, a number of little specks sail
serenely along toward the channel where the two ships lie.
Presently, a gentle SIGHING becomes audible. Then a GEYSER of
water, followed by another, then another, pops high up out of
the sea, until at last a stick of three bombs falls almost
directly alongside an LCI that is just putting off. When the
spout of water subsides, they see there is nothing left of
the LCI, only a few figures bobbing in the water who, under
the weight of their full packs, rapidly become fewer.

EXT. FIELD DRESSING STATION - DAY

The survivors of the destroyed LCI are landed by a rescue

boat not far from C-for-Charlie Company, and gently led or
carried up from the beach to a nearby field dressing station.
Some of them are still vomiting seawater from their ordeal. C-
for-Charlie drifts up toward the dressing station, consumed
with a morbid curiosity. DALE, the muscular, intense second
cook, with perpetually snapping eyes, makes the only comment.

DALE
They should of let them have it
with the antiaircraft from the
ships! They could of got a lot more
of them. If I'd been there, and had
my hands on one of them forty
millimeters, I'd of let them have
it, orders or no orders. That's
what I'd of done.

MAZZI
You'd shit, too.
EXT. MANGROVES AND BEACH ROAD - DAY

They trudge through the mangroves to their bivouac, led by
the Route Guide from regimental headquarters.
19.

The roads are seas of soft mud, axle-deep on the trucks. It
is impossible to march on or in them. The only way for the
men to move ahead at all is to travel in two lines, one on
either side, picking their way over the great rolls of drying
mud, turned back as though by a plow. Staggering, and
senseless with exhaustion, they march on. By the time they
reach their bivouac, it has begun to rain.

EXT. COCONUT GROVE BIVOUAC - DAY

C-for-Charlie works doggedly to set up camp. The rain comes
straight down, unbreathed-upon by any wind, in huge, fat
drops so close together that it seems a solid sheet of water
Turning around, Fife sees that some of the men (Marl among
them) are playing in the mud, sitting down and sliding around
like children in snow, clowning and laughing.

INT. ORDERLY ROOM TENT - DAY
Welsh enters the orderly room tent and nods at Capt. Stein.

WELSH
Sir, the company's allotment of
eight-man personnel tents hasn't
arrived from the ship.

STEIN
Have the men break packs and put'
up their shelter tents.
(as Welsh grins)
Goddamn it, Sergeant, I know it's a
ridiculous order, too! Now go and
tell them! That's an order!

WELSH
Yes, sir!
EXT. BIVOUAC - DAY

Welsh has given the men Stein's order, with sardonic relish,
and they are setting about it.

MAZZI
He's nuts! Plain fucking nuts!

Tills sits on a five-gallon water can buttoning their shelter
halves together. Mazzi gathers their combined ten tent pegs,
having stretched the wet ropes as best he can.
20.

MAZZI

You think these goddamn little old
pegs going to hold in this muck? I
was company commander of this
company, there'd be a lotta changes
around here, and pretty damn
fuckin' quick. And up yours, Tills.
You about finished there?

TILLS
Look, Mazzi, I want to ask you
somethin'. You think there's any
germs in this mud?

MAZZI
Germs? Sure there's germs.

TILLS
You really think so?

MAZZI
Why, hell yes. Don't you read the
papers? This island's loaded with
all kinds of germs. And where do
you find germs? In dirt. Malaria
germs...

TILLS
(interrupting)
Malaria germs are in the
mosquitoes.

MAZZI
Sure, but where do they get them?
From dirt. There's --

TILLS
No. They get them from other people
who got malaria.

MAZZI
Okay, sure. But where they come
from first? Everybody knows germs
come from dirt and bein' dirty.
You'll prob'ly be sick as a dog
tomorra, Tills.

TILLS
You're a son of a bitch, Mazzi.

MAZZI
Who? Me? What'd I do? You ast me a
question, I answered it for you.
(MORE )
21.

You din’t %#éeZie atown' hd slidin’
around in that mud, did you? Sure,
I laughed, I cheered them on. That
didn't cost me nothin’. Trouble
with you, Tills, you’re a jerkoff.
You're awys gettin’ sucked into
somethin’. Take a lesson, kid. You
don't see me gettin’ sucked into
nothing.

Around them, other men are working and other shelter tents
are going up in long, even lines. The ground is a soggy mire.

Doll, the proud pistol thief, swaggers over to his pal Fife,
who has just finished putting up the tent which he shares
with his assistant, PFC BEAD. Bead is a draftee, a healthy
eighteen-year-old from Iowa, the youngest man in the outfit

DOLL
We still got a couple of hours
before sundown. Bunch of us is
goin’ to look at the jungle. wanta
come?

FIFE
I don't know if I ought to. The
sergeant might need me around here
for something.

BEAD
I'll go, Doll! I'll go!

DOLL
You ain't invited.

BEAD
Whada you mean I ain't invited?
Anybody can go that wants to, can't
they?

Doll leaves. Bead is crestfallen.

FIFE
Never mind him.

EXT. JUNGLE - DAY

A dozen of the men from C-for-Charlie -- among them Big

Queen, the huge Texan, and Private Bell, the former officer --
approach the high wall of jungle curiously and gingerly.
Parrots screech from nowhere, startling them. Huge vines and
creepers hang from the canopy in great festooning arcs.
22.

Giant tree trunks tower straight up , far above their heads,
their thin blade-like roots often higher than a man's head.
Other POVs: a skull shrine, a wood carving of a man the
features of whose face have been eroded by the weather, a
python, strange tropical fruits, some split open by raiding
ants.

Suddenly Queen discovers a bloodstained shirt. For a moment
he thinks of saying nothing. He could pass it by and none of
the rest of them would know. But, noticing his strange
hesitation, the MAN next to him sees it too and raises a
shout. The other men, who instinctively have spaced
themselves out at five-yard intervals as if in a skirmish
line, cluster around and peer excitedly.

VOICES

(Gordon's esp.)
Is it American? Fuck yes, it's
American. The Japs don't wear khaki
like that. That's chino! That's not
even Marine khaki! That's Army
chino! Well, the Americal
Division's here. Maybe he's one of

them.

QUEEN
Whoever he was, he was hit pretty
bad.

THORNE

Where'd it hit him?

GORDON
It keyholed out the back.

PRIVATE GORDON, one of the men nearest it, leans down
silently and picks it up with a thumb and forefinger, as if
afraid he might catch a terrible disease from it.

QUEEN
Leave it where you found it.

Without a word, Gordon, who still holds it by thumb and
forefinger as if it might contaminate him, turns and swings
it and lets it go.

THORNE
Yeah, leave'm lay.

The chow WHISTLE sounds clear and shrill through the trees.
It is an intensely familiar, curiously heart-wringing sound.
23.

EXT. MESS TENT - DAY

Tonight C-for-Charlie receives its first dosage of Atabrine.
Standing by the Lister bag at the head of the chow line
Storm doles out the yellow pills himself, chaffing everyone
good-naturedly, but determined that nobody is going to avoid
taking his medicine.

WELSH
What the fuck do you bother so hard
for?

STORM

Because, they going to need all the
help they can git.

WELSH
They going to need a lot more than
that.

STORM
I know it.

The last man in the line has stopped and is looking back at
them, listening; one of the draftees.

WELSH
On your way, bud.

STORM
(shaking his pills)
Some of them so dumb they actu'ly
wouldn't take them. If I didn't
make them.

WELSH
So what? They don't take them,
maybe they'll get malaria so bad
they'll get themself shipped out
and save their useless life.

STORM
They ain't learned that yet. They
will.

WELSH

We'll be ahead of them. Won't we?
We'll make them fucking take them.
Won't we? You and me. We know the
secret, don't we? We already know
about not taking them. Gimme one.
24.

Storm holds out the box. Without taking his eyes from Storm's
face, Welsh reaches down, gets a pill and, thumbing the
surface dust off it, pops it into his mouth. Not to be
outdone, Storm gets one himself and swallows it as Welsh has
dry.

WELSH
You know what it is, don't you? You
realize what's happening... There

ain't any choice. It ain't going to
get any better, either. This war's
just the start. You understand

that.
STORM
Yeah.
WELSH
Then remember it, Storm; remember
it.

Bell and Fife sit by themselves eating in silence.

BELL

This war is tougher on her than it
is on me. Back home there's lights
and nightclubs, booze. More to
tempt you. I haven't touched
another woman since I was called
up. Or talked to one. I don't want
to feel the desire.

STORM (0.S.)
hairs on the table! Closing time!

 

Q

BELL
We believe in each other. You need
someone you can believe in.

Dale complains to a willing listener about Storm's
mistreatment of him. Not far away, Bead is blowing soap
bubbles, dipping a ring in the shaving lather he has whipped
up in the bottom of his helmet.

EXT. SLIT TRENCH - NIGHT

The night is filled with the stitch of tropical insects. The
men crouch over the weapons in total and unspeakable
insularity.
25.

FIFE
I always thought I'd be as brave as
the next guy, maybe even braver
But I m not. You told me about your
wife. I'm telling you something.

BELL
Everybody's scared.

FIFE
Not Doll, not Big Un. I got to work
harder at it than they do. The only
reason I'm here is because I was
ashamed for people to think I was a
coward. I had to find out if I was
yellow or not... I never had a wife
and kids. I never been to New York.
I don't want to die.

SELL
Nobody does.

FIFE
I hope I can get back -- the way I
was -- like I came.

They look up at a scuttling noise in the undergrowth, at
length discover a coconut crab. (End on CU of crab.)

EXT. COCONUT GROVE - NIGHT

Stein is writing a letter by candlelight when he hears the
noise of a Japanese plane high overhead. (Washing Machine
Charlie.) Suddenly the earth is SHAKING around him. Panic and
an objectless fright seize him, and he surges blindly out of
his tent, scrambling toward a nearby slit trench.

Down the long aisle of the coconut groves, the KLAXONS begin
their mournful, insistent belching. Above, three weak
searchlight beams feebly finger the sky. Now and then they
see the single QUICK BLINK of an antiaircraft shell
exploding. Finally, there is the SHUTTERING, THIN sound of
the motor, or motors, up there in the dark. Then, from the
direction of the airfield, come the CA-RUMPING explosions
walking slowly toward them in great giant strides. The
klaxons keep up their long, monotonous, insane, GROWLING
protest, and the antiaircraft guns PUMP their useless
laughable shells up into the night sky, as the ball-shrinking
ROAR of the bombs advances.
26.

Suddenly, there is a huge, ear-filling, impersonal, rushing
FLUTTER descending like an express train, then a flash of
light. It is strange that only one man is wounded. By all
rights, there should be many more. The wounded man is Pfc
Marl, the Nebraska dry-dirt farmer. A piece of the
daisycutter has whistled into his hole and cut off his right
hand as neatly as a surgeon could have done with a knife.
When Marl yells, Welsh leaps in with him and puts a
tourniquet on him until the medic can get there.

MARL
What'm I gonna do now, huh? How'm I
gonna work, huh! How'm I donna
plow, huh? I mean it. What’m I
gonna do now, huh? Take it away!
Get that damned thing out of here!
I don't want to look at it, goddamn
it! It's my hand!

The hand is taken away by one of the company MEDICS, who is
supposed to be trained at this kind of work but actually is
not as yet, and who stops to vomit behind a tree.

WELSH
They make artificial ones. They'll
make you one like new.

MARL
Goddamn it, it's easy for you!
How'm I gonna work? I'm a farmer.

MEDIC
Can you walk?

MARL
Sure I can walk, goddamn it. Fuck
yes, I can walk. But how'm I gonna
work? That's the point.

Fife watches, trembling within, as Marl is led off into the
darkness to the battalion medical station, the first actual
wounded casualty in the company.

MONTAGE - WITT AND HOKE AMONG THE MELANESIANS (GUADALCANAL )

Witt and Hoke have gone AWOL and are living among the
Melanesians, unconscious of the passage of the days, of good
and evil. The native people live content with what the earth
and sea provide them, in peace and harmony. Witt gets to know
two of them in particular, an older man and a young woman. He
marvels at this society where no one is alone or lives to
himself, where all is based on family and clan.
27.

He reveals to Hoke a secret from his past and, under the
influence of this revelation, decides to return to C-for-
Charlie. Hoke tries to discourage him from setting out but
at length, joins him instead.

EXT. C-FOR-CHARLIE BIVOUAC - DAWN

The men of C-for-Charlie come out into the warm, revivifying
safety of the sun and look into each other's stubbled, dirt-
caked faces to find they are changed men. Faces glower and
eyes burn. Suddenly, Fife hears himself hailed by a man
standing some distance off, near the supply tent and leaning
against a coco palm.

FIFE
Well, Witt! By God! How are you!

A troublemaker with a touchy sense of honor, Witt has been
busted several times and twice sent to the stockade on a
summary court-martial. This makes him something of a romantic
hero to Fife, who considers him the only friend besides Bell
that he has in the whole regiment. He rushes over to shake
hands, overjoyed to see him. Witt is just as glad, in his own
way. All his friends are in C-for-Charlie, and he likes the
reputation he enjoys here. As Witt sees it, everybody knows
he loves C-for-Charlie and for Welsh to ship him out, while
knowing this, only proves his total contempt for Welsh
correct.

FIFE

How'd you find us? You AWOL? I been
asking around about you every day,
trying to find out were you were. I
thought you were in the brig. How
long you been hanging around here?
Why didn't you come in the orderly
tent and get me?

Witt's face hardens, almost as though someone had modeled his
features in quick-setting cement and Fife were watching it
dry.

WITT
I ain't goin' no place where that
poorly son of a bitch of a first
sergeant is.

FIFE
Welsh? Yes, well. Well, you know, I
think maybe he's changed some
Witt. Since we got here.
28.

WITT
He ain't never going to change. Not
in no way.

FI FE

Well, I tell you. It just won't be
the same old company, Witt. Going
up there without you. I guess
that's why I said that.

WITT

(warming up)
Fife, I can tell you. When I think
of old C-for-Charlie goin’ up there
into them Japs without me, it like
to breaks my heart. I been in this
comp’ny -- what now? -- four years.
You know how I feel about it. It’s
my comp’ny. It ain’t right, that’s
all. It ain’t. I belong with the
company, Fife, old buddy.

(suddenly morose)
I don’t know what I can do about
it. In fact, there ain’t a damn
thing.

FIFE
Well, I think if you went around to
Capt. Stein and told him how you
feel, he'd arrange a transfer back
for you. Bugger knows how good a
soldier you are. Never was a
question of that. Right now he's
feeling pretty warm and sentimental
about the company, leading them
into combat and all.

WITT
I cain't do that.
FIFE
Why not?
WITT
Because I cain't. You know it.
FIFE
I honestly think he'll take you
back.
WITT

Take me back! Take me back! They
never should of made me go!
(MORE)
29.

It's their Wialiitconitt' djin't mine! I
didn't need no discipline.
Discipline is what you give a dog!
I cain't do that. I won't go and
beg them. I appreciate you tryin'

to help.
(as Fife nods)
I mean it.

FIFE
I know you do.

Fife goes on carefully, afraid of making him mad.

FIFE
Just how bad do you want to get
back into the comp’ny?

WITT
You know how bad.

FIFE
Well, the only way you're going to
do it is to go to Stein and ask
him.

WITT
I cain't do that. I tell you it
ain't fair. It ain't fair, and it
ain't square. Any way you look at
it. It ain't justice. It's a
traversty of justice.

FIFE
It's "travesty."

WITT
What?

FIFE

I said you pronounce it tra-ves-ty.

Witt stares at him as if he had never seen him before. The
storm cloud, with its flickers of impending electrical
discharges, comes back on his face.

WITT
Take off! I said take off! Leave!
Get out!

FIFE

I got as much right here as you
have.
30.

WITT
Fife, I never hit a friend before
in my life. Not without givin' them
fair warnin' they ain't friends no
more. I don't want to start now,
either. But I will.

FIFE
What the hell kind of talk is that?
What did I do?

WITT
You and me ain't friends anymore. I
don't want to talk to you, I don't
want to see you. If you even try to
talk to me after this, I'll knock
you down.

FIFE
I was only kidding with you. I only

WITT
Take off! Scoot!

FIFE
You're a boxer. I don't stand a
chance with you in a fight and you
know it.

WITT
That's tough. That's life. Go!

FIFE
I'm going. But you're crazy, for
God's sake. I was kidding you.
You're my best friend in this
outfit. I don't want to fight you.

WITT
(with sadness now)
Take off!

Fife does. He sees that Witt is right and that he did
something terribly mean, vicious and insulting, something
destructive to Witt's manhood. Guilt closes over him like a
mustard-colored cloud.

The men are inspecting a large crocodile that the 2nd
Battalion men have captured when Bugger Stein and his driver
ROAR up in the company jeep. The men have heard the SOUNDS of
mortar and small arms fire off in the hills yesterday and
today, growling more angrily today than yesterday.
31.

And yet, when their orders finally come to go up, everybody
is astonished and surprised.

STEIN
Corporal Fife, I want every officer
and platoon-grade noncom who isn't
out on a detail here in five
minutes. Get them all. Don't miss
anybody. We're moving out, Fife.
For the line.

EXT. MUDDY ROAD/OTHER COMPANY BIVOUAC - DAY

Along the route of march, the arteries of runny mud are
clotted with stalled trucks. Most are abandoned, sitting
silent in the mud, waiting for the big tractors to come haul
them out.

The foot marchers pick their way up the steep road, loaded
down with full packs and extra bandoliers, each company ina
ragged single file. Often one of their number turns aside and
falls down. Others simply faint. These are dragged aside by
the men behind them.

WELSH
Pick up your feet! On your feet!
Pick 'em up and keep moving!

Fife has the misfortune of falling out when Capt. Stein is
nearby.

STEIN
Up you come, Fife! Come on, boy.
You don't want to give up now.

The reaction he gets is startling. Fife does not get up. He
leaps up. As if stabbed in the ass with a needle.

FIFE
You! You tell me! I'll be walking
when you're on your back! I'll be
going when you and all these other
guys are on your knees and out!

STEIN
Shut up, Fife!

FIFE
You and any other goddamned
officer! I'll walk till I drop dead
-- and when I do, I'll be ten feet
in front of your dead body! Don't
you ever worry about me quitting.
32.

Staggering in his pack, Fife lurches out onto the edge of the
road. He does not shut up. Stein does not know what to do. It
is up to him to make an issue or not make one.

Fife is past the point of caring. He decides to do nothing.
Nobody else seems to care, or pays much attention, they are
all too tired. Looking up the road he sees a Melanesian
native with a haunted look hurrying past in the opposite
direction, away from the front. Then he sees that Sgt. Welsh
is watching, a vague smile on his face.

EXT. SUGAR CANE PLANTATION (DRUMSARA) - DAY

They are walking up a line of railroad tracks that runs
through a sugar cane plantation when a GUIDE (KIRK) comes
around a bend, sees them, and after a couple of deep gasps
for air, comes on at a quickened pace, already shouting.

KIRK
Where the fuck have you guys been?
I been lookin' all over hell's half
acre for this outfit! What the hell
have you been doin'? You're
supposed to be on the other side
the river, not here! what the fuck
happened? Honestly, sir, I been
lookin' all over. You're supposed
to be clear over on the other side
the river. That's where they tole
me you'd be.

STEIN
We've been following the road the
other guide showed us.

KIRK
He must of made some kind of a
mistake.

STEIN
He was positive about what he told
us.

KIRK

Somebody up there gave him the
wrong orders. Or told me wrong.

Not a very auspicious beginning. The men glance at each
other.

STEIN
What's it like up there?
33.

KIRK
A crazyhouse!

A stirring in the grass, the rustle of the sugar cane,
signals the approach of danger. At Kirk's signal, the company
stops. He pulls out a grenade and, stepping into the rows of
cane, advances toward the source of the noise. He discovers a
white cow. (A feral Indo-Chinese pig? They wandered loose,
shellshocked. )

EXT. RIVER - DAY
They cross a pontoon bridge (or ford) guarded by a heavy MG.

Groups of traffic-control men watch them with curious
sympathetic eyes.

KIRK
You just go on from here.

STEIN
There must be more instructions
than that.

KIRK

I don't know nothing about none of
that. All I know I was suppose to
bring you here.

STEIN
Won't they send another runner for
us?

KIRK

Maybe. I don't know. All I know is
what I told you.

EXT. MOUNTING ROAD (JUNGLE TO GRASSLANDS) - DAY

MUSIC enters as they begin to climb. Gradually, they come out
of the jungle onto the grassy slopes above. S/SGT. STACK, the
tough, hard-faced old disciplinarian who leads 3rd Platoon
has suffered a collapse. He the trail with his legs pressed
tightly together and his rifle in his lap, shaking all over.
The medics have put a tag on him and thrust a stick in his
hand.

STACK
Don't go up there! You'll be
killed! Don't go up there! You'll
be killed!
34.

The entire company has to pass him, one at a time and man by
man, in single file, as if passing in some macabre review.

EXT. HILLTOP (HILL 208) - DAY

Toiling, climbing with the wind behind them, they have heard
no battle noises. But rounding the last bend and coming
suddenly out onto the open hilltop, they find themselves
immersed in a vast infernal NOISE and tumult whose source
they cannot see. Men scurry here and there on obscure
missions, shouting to make themselves heard above the DIN.
The center of all their activity is a small group of seven
men standing together in grand isolation. They are almost the
only men present wearing any insignia, and all of them wear
stars or eagles on the collars of their green fatigues.

For all the NOISE, they are receiving very little fire. Now
and then a single bullet strikes the ground in amongst them
and buries itself or goes SHRIEKING off without touching
anyone.

DALE
Are those ricochets? Are they
shootin’ at us?

Soon they advance into a dry, treeless ravine. Here, at last
they can see what lies ahead of them, though they still have
no sense of where they are or how they are being deployed.

BEAD
Is this the line? Are we on the
line? Maybe they don't see us
either.

Fife looks this way and that, to see if there is something or
someone about to shoot at him. He has a singular feeling of
exposure, like a man standing on the edge of a mountaintop.
When first ONE BULLET and then a moment later A SECOND kick
up puffs of dust in front of him, he kneels to the ground and
begins to crawl, convinced some Japanese sniper has singled
him out to shoot at.

Guilty and ashamed, he raises his head to look around. The
rest of the company is standing up walking and already ahead
of him. Terrified as he is of standing up and being shot at
by some invisible party, he is more terrified of being
accused for his cowardice. He begins to jog toward his
company, trotting bent over at the waist and carrying his
rifle at high port. He smiles at the others on joining them.
It comforts him unreasonably to be in their midst.
35.

And it is just here that the second man in the company is
wounded, whether deliberately or by accident no one can tell:
PEALE, not far from Fife, suddenly claps his hand to his
thigh and stops, then sits down holding his leg, his lips
trembling, his face white.

BELL
You all right, Peale?

PEALE
I'm hit. I'm wounded. I'm hit in
the leg.

MEDIC

Can you walk?

PEALE
I don't think so. I think my leg
hurts pretty bad. You better help
me. I think it's goin' to be a long
time before I can walk again.

Stein is already calling to the men who have stopped to move
on, keep going, don't stop.

VOICES
So long, Peale. Take it easy,
Peale. Good luck, Peale.

PEALE

So long, you guys. So long. You
guys take it easy. So long. Good
luck, you guys. Don't worry about
me. It'll be a long time before I
can walk good. No doctor's goin' to
tell me I can walk on this leg.
Good luck, you guys!

(to the Medic)
I got me a Purple Heart, and I been
in combat. I never even seen a Jap,
but I don't care. No doctor's gonna
tell me I can walk on this leg for
a long time. Come on, let's get out
of this. Before we get killed.
That'd be hell, wouldn't it?

EXT. GRASSY RIDGE (HILL 209) - DAY

C-for-Charlie takes shelter behind a ridge. Welsh goes around
telling them to buddy up for the night.
36.

MAZZI
This Tills. He spent more time on
his belly than he did up on his
feet. I don't see how he managed to
keep up with the rest of us. Ain't
that right, Tills? Didn't you?

TILLS
I guess you never hit the dirt any,
did you?

MAZZI

Did you see me? You fucking-A, you
didn't, Tills. what was the use?
Anybody could tell that fire wasn't
aimed fire. It was stray stuff from
the ridge. Could hit you just as
well layin' down as standin' up.
Maybe better.

TILLS
And I guess you wasn't never scared
even once?

FIFE
I was.

BEAD
So was I. Scared to death! I never
been so scared in my life. I'm
still scared, right now!

They all laugh, even Stein and Mazzi, the New York hep guy.
Only Welsh does not. As if to prove Fife right, there is an
instant's FLUTTERING sound in the air, not unlike a man
blowing through a keyhole, and three GEYSERS of dirt spout
into the air thirty-five yards away, followed instantly by
one loud CLAP of sound. There is an ant-like scramble on the
little spur, as everyone tries to hit the dirt on the slope
away from the surprise. Private Mazzi, if not the foremost

is certainly not the last among them. Tills smiles and shoots
him the finger.

TILLS
You wasn't scared! Not even once!

MAZZI
I guess you stood up there like a
big fucking hero, fuckface.

They unship their entrenching tools and start digging. Fife
goes over to Welsh who is preparing to dig digging. Storm.
37.

FIFE
Hey, First, is this where you
guys’ve decided to dig in? I
thought I'd dig in over here with
you guys, if it was. I mean, I
guess it's as good a place as any.

He unslings his pack. Welsh stops his unbuckling of straps
and looks up at Fife with a face as expressionless as
granite.

WELSH
Take off. Get the fuck away from
me. Stay away from me, kid.

Storm has stopped his work to watch. Fife is carried back a
step by the viciousness of the sergeant's retort. Somehow he
imagined their approach to combat would soften Welsh's
attitude. Welsh stares at him, silent, refusing to be drawn
into any discussion. Visibly crestfallen, unable to hide it,
Fife turns and moves off carrying his pack by its straps.

STORM
Why don't you treat the kid decent
once in a while? He's your clerk
isn't he?

WELSH
I don't mean to wind up playin'
nursemaid. I got enough problems to
occupy me. Here. You got some dirt.
Take the shovel, gimme the mattock.

Mazzi is still infuriated at Tills for giving him the finger
when the mortar shells dropped in. It was an unfair advantage
because everybody ducked for cover.

MAZZI
Shoot me the finger, will ya? I
didn't pick you for a buddy. I
don't like to be buddying with a
hick from Hicksville who ain't even
hep. I got no choice. I treat you
right and give you good advice. You
ignore it, do something else,
always wrong. You won't never
learn.

TILLS
Fuck you, Mazzi.
38.

MAZZI
This time, Tills, you tore it. I
ain't going to have nothing more to
do with you.

TILLS
I could give a shit.

MAZZI
I ain't going to dig with you. I'm
going to dig with Sico. I'm going
up the ridge, and fuck you. Do your
own damn thinkin’!

He can feel Tills looking after him as he walks up to the
crest, to join his New York buddies in the 1st Platoon, but
he ignores him.

EXT. GRASSY RIDGE (HILL 209) - DAY

Fife finds Welsh alone.

FIFE
Why're you always jumping down my
throat?

WELSH

You're finally learning how
important you are to the world,
kid. Taken you long enough. Hurts,
don't it? Shock to the system.

FIFE
You don't believe in nothing, do
you?

WELSH

You've still got illusions, kid.
You won't for long.

FIFE
What do you believe in, Sergeant?

WELSH
Property. That's what they're all
fighting over. Property!

Welsh takes a large Listerine bottle full of straight gin
from his musette bag, tips it back and pretends to take loud
gargles for a nonexistent sore throat. They look around as
PFC Gordon, with his flying fox, staggers up, breathless
with news that sickens them all.
39.

GORDON
They found two guys from George
Comp'ny -- I heard it from the

runner -- the Japs took ‘em
prisoner -- stabbed 'em with
bayonets, fifty times. One of ‘em
beheaded -- alive -- with a sword.

E Comp'ny found 'im with his hands
tied behind his back -- head
sitting on his chest. They'd
stuffed his dick in his mouth.

The sheer barbarity of the thing sweeps through C-for-Charlie
like a cold-water shock.

DOLL
I ain't never going to take a
fucking prisoner. I'm going to
shoot every one of them comes my
way. Preferably in the guts.

QUEEN
The dirty fuckers!

DALE
Okay. Okay. Okay.

The battle round the bend, which they can hear but not see,
has continued unabated. Now for the first time, whole groups
begin to return from it. The attack has failed. Strangers
from the 2nd Battalion drop gasping over the crest of the
ridge and lie breathing in hysterical sobs with eyes like
drilled holes dark in their outraged, furious, unbelieving
faces. They look at C-for-Charlie with astonishment, then
hasten on toward the rear.

More and more keep coming in, haphazard, piecemeal, rarely
even with their own squads, hollering to them not to shoot
for God's sake, don't shoot. Once inside C-for-Charlie's
perimeter, they simply collapse. One boy, sitting in a row of
five or six, weeps openly like a child, his forehead and hand
resting on the shoulder of the man next to him, who pats him
absently while staring straight ahead at nothing with
smoldering eyes. A man with semaphore flags signals the rear.
None of them knows what the overall situation is, or has any
idea of what is taking place anywhere except where they
themselves have been. C-for-Charlie, feeling shamefaced
watches quietly with a wide-eyed, awed hero worship, which no
one can honestly say he wants to lose, if it means sharing
their experience.

The division COMMANDER suddenly appears among them, smiling
and talking, and tries to rally their morale.
40.

GENERAL
Whoa! We're not gonna let these
Japs whip us, are we, boys? They're
tough, but they're not as tough as
we are, are they?

PVT. DRAKE
General, you go out there! You go
out there, General, you go out
there!

EXT. HILL 209 - DAY

As the red-and-white-splashed walking wounded totter rearward
in groups, trying to help each other, Storm crawls over to
the hole he shares with Welsh.

STORM
There ain't no water left. I seen
jeeploads of water cans on the way
up from the river. They probably
got diverted to the rear.

WELSH
Or poured out on the ground.

STORM
Whichever. People's going to have
to eat my supper dry.

Welsh watches the sun drop behind the mountains. Guadalcanal
is a green, peaceful island, not unlike Tahiti. Here the
night does not fall so swiftly as it did down in the groves
below. Far away, Welsh sees dogs and feral pigs feasting on
the dead.

BELL'S DREAM- SERIES OF ANGLES (SECOND UNIT) - D/N

Bell dreams of his wife MARTY. He remembers the first time
they saw each other, the first time their hands touched. The
dream progresses. She stands on a white sand beach, watching
a boat sail toward a solitary island. She enters a cave. (In
all this we occasionally look over Bell's shoulder but we
never see him face on.)

EXT. GRASSY RIDGE (HILL 209) BELL'S SLIT TRENCH - FLARES -
DUSK

Bell wakes up with a cry that throws the Sentry in the next
hole into a panic. Green flares are falling through the sky.
41.

SENTRY (0.S.)
I can't see anything! I can't see
anything!

WELSH
Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Wait!
Don't anybody fire!

BELL
It was me. I had -- a nightmare.

SENTRY (0.S.)
Well, for fuck's sake, try and keep
it to yourself! You scared the
living shit out of me.

GORDON
Why don't they come? What are they
waiting for? Why don't they do
something?

The suspense, exaggerated by the THRUM of the tropical night
is unbearable. There is a sudden explosion of RIFLE FIRE from
the holes on their right. All around them, men are hollering
happily and throwing their GRENADES and FIRING. And in front
of them, the empty jungle underbrush sways and RUSTLES as
though in a rainstorm, and chunks of bark and wood pop from
the trees. The MORTAR and RIFLE FIRE lights up the night
betraying positions, hitting nothing. A few more useless
thermite GRENADES are thrown, and then the thick silence
resumes.

EXT. HILL 209 - DAWN

At dawn, bearded, mud-stained, grimy and greasy, the men rise
in their blue holes and peer around, like the dead rising
from-their graves on the Last Day. Some of them our water
from their canteens onto their toothbrushes to rush their
teeth.

Bead has to take a crap. Without saying anything to anyone,
he drops all of his equipment by his hole and, taking only
his GI roll of toilet paper, he starts to climb the twenty
yards to the crest.

EXT. HILL 209 CREST - DAY

The trees begin three yards below the actual crest. Bead
steps into their midst. Halfway through with relieving
himself, he looks up and sees a Japanese man with a bayoneted
rifle moving stealthily through the trees ten yards away.
42.

The Japanese man sees him too and, turning, all in one
movement, begins to run at him, but moving cautiously, the
bayonet on the end of his rifle extended. Bead, still
squatting with his pants down, gathers his weight under him.
In desperation, still not knowing which way to try to Dump
all in one movement, Bead pulls up his pants over his behind
to free his legs and dives forward in a low, shoestring
football tackle when the Japanese man is almost to him,
tackling him around the ankles. This gives Bead time to hitch
up his pants again and spring upward once more until,
kneeling on his upper arms and sitting back on his chest, he
begins to punch and claw him in the face and neck.

Bead hears a high, keening SCREAM and thinks it is the
Japanese begging for mercy, until finally he slowly becomes
aware that the Japanese man is now unconscious. Then he
realizes it is himself making this animal scream. Sobbing and
wailing, he continues to belabor the unconscious Japanese
with his fingernails and fists. Then he rolls aside, seizes
the enemy rifle and, on his knees, raises it above his head
and drives the long bayonet almost full-length into the
Japanese man's chest. The Japanese man's body convulses in a
single spasm. His eyes open, staring horribly at nothing, and
his hands flip up from the elbows and seize the blade through
his chest. Bead withdraws the bayonet, throws the rifle from
him and falls down on his hands and knees and begins to vomit
and weep.

EXT. HILL 209 - DAY

GORDON
Have a good shit?

Bead is ashamed and embarrassed by the whole thing, that is
the truth, and that is why he doesn't want to mention it to
anybody. He gets back through the lines all right, without
further questions. But as he approaches C-for-Charlie, he is
joined by Pfc Doll, on his way down from ist Platoon.

DOLL
Man alive! What happened to your
knuckles? You have a fight with
somebody?

BEAD
No. I slipped and fell.

DOLL
And I 'spose all them little blood
splatters come from your knuckles?
43.

BEAD
Leave me alone, Doll! I don't feel
like talking! So just leave me
alone, hunh? Will you?

They walk on down in silence. Doll has been a little taken
aback by Bead's vehemence, a forcefulness he is not used to
from Bead. He can smell something when he sees it. Seeing
Welsh and Storm, he goes over to them, grinning.

DOLL
What the fuck happen to your boy
there? who the hell he beat up with
them skinned knuckles and all them
blood splatters on him? Did I miss
somethin'?

WELSH
Bead, come over here! What happened
to you?

BEAD

Who? Me? Well, I slipped and
skinned myself, that's all.

WELSH
Where'd you go a while ago? When
you were gone for a while? Where
were you?

BEAD
I went off to take a crap.

DOLL
Wait! When I seen him, he was
comin’ down from the 2nd Platoon's
section of line on the ridge.

WELSH

Lissen, kid, I got more problems
than I know what to do with in this
screwy outfit. I got no time to
fuck around with kid games. I want
to know what happened to you, and I
want the truth. Look at yourself!
Now, what happened? Where were you?

BEAD
Well, I went across the ridge
outside the line. A Jap guy came up
while I was there and he tried to
bayonet me. And -- I killed him.
44.

Bead exhales a long, fluttering breath, then inhales sharply
and gulps. Everyone is staring at him disbelievingly.

WELSH
Goddamn it, kid! I told you I
wanted the goddamn fucking truth!
And not no kid games!

BEAD
Then goddamn you go and look! Don't
take my word, go and look for your
goddamn fucking self!

 

DOLL
I'll go.

WELSH
You'll go nowhere, stoolie.
(turning to Bead)
I'll go myself. And if you're
tyin', kid, God help your ass. All
right. Where is it? Come on, show
me.

BEAD
I'm not going up there again! You
want to go, go by yourself! But I
ain't going! And nothin's gonna
make me!

WELSH
Okay. Where is it, then?

Storm puts on his helmet and picks up his Thompson.

BEAD
A few yards beyond the crest, front
of Krim's hole. You won't need all
the goddamned artillery, Welsh!
There’s nobody up there now but
him!

DOLL
Top, you wouldn't keep me from
goin’, would you?

Welsh stares at him a moment, then without change of
expression, turns away silently. It is obviously a reprimand.
Doll chooses to take it as silent acquiescence. And with
himself in the rear, the search party starts the climb to the
line. Meanwhile, Bead confides his anguish to Fife.
45.

BEAD
He felt it. He knew what was
happening. I just lost my head, I
was afraid. I could of taken him
prisoner, we could of gotten
valuable information from him.
Everything I ever did I fucked up.
I just wish I hadn't touched him.
Now I can't never wash it off.
Don't kill nobody, Fife! If you can
help it! I swear it right now, I'm
never going to kill again.

They look up to see the little scouting party has returned.

WELSH
He's there.

DALE
He sure is.

Doll has hunted up the Japanese rifle and brings it back for
Bead. He presents it as if presenting an apology offering.

DOLL
Here, this is yours. I scrubbed the
blood off with leaves. I wiped off
the bayonet.

BEAD
I don't want it.
DOLL
You won it. The hard way.
BEAD
I don't want it anyway. What good's
it to me?
DOLL

(laying it down)
Maybe you can trade it for whiskey.
And here's his wallet. Welsh said
to give it to you. There's a
picture of his wife in it.

BEAD
Good Lord, Doll.

DOLL
There's pictures of other broads
too. Filipino, looks like. Maybe he
was in the Philippines.
46.

BEAD
I don't want it anyway. You keep
it.

But he takes the proffered wallet anyway, his curiosity
piqued, in spite of himself. He looks at it.

FIFE
He feels guilty.

DOLL
Guilty! What the hell for? It was
him or you, wasn't it? How many our
guys you think maybe he stuck that
bayonet in the Philippines? How
about those two guys yesterday?

BEAD
I can't help it.
DOLL
Why!
BEAD
Why! How the fuck do I know why!
DOLL
Listen -- if you really don't want
that wallet.
BEAD
No, I'll keep it. I might as well.
DOLL
Well -- I got to get back up to the
platoon.
(admiringly)

I'll say one thing. When you set
out to kill him, you really killed
him.

BEAD
You think so?

DOLL
I ain't the only one.

He turns and leaves, heading up the slope. Bead sees the
others looking at him from afar, as though he were a
different person. He is not sure whether he enjoys this or
not. He is not surprised when Stein comes over.
47.

STEIN
Bead, I know you've been pretty
upset by what happened to you
today. That's unavoidable. Anybody
would be. I thought you might like
to talk about it.

Kirk appears and kneels down behind Bead, waiting his chance
to speak with the Captain.

STEIN
You had no choice. You only did
what any other good soldier would
have done, for our country or any
other. I want you to know that
after this war is over, if there is
anything I can ever do for you
just get in touch with me. I'll do
anything I can to help you.

KIRK
The Colonel's here to see you, sir.

EXT. HILL 209 - DAY

Stein has received unbelievable orders from Lt. Col. Tall,
1st Battalion Commander. Tall is lean, a West Pointer.

STEIN
We can't do that, Colonel!

COL. TALL
There's no way to outflank them. On
the left there's the cliff. It
falls straight down to the river.
The Japanese hold the bungle. It
has to be taken frontally.

STEIN
What about the water? The water's
not getting up here. My men are
passing out.

Tall looks at him, gives a slight nod, then looks away,
leaving Stein's question unanswered. Stein looks at his
watch. The-next moment, as though under a spell, he explains
to his officers and noncoms what their objective is.

They kneel just behind the crest. Stein points out the
features of the land that lies ahead of them; they inspect it
through binoculars. There are three folds of land, like
gentle ocean swells. Beyond them lies Hill 210.
48.

STEIN
We're all going to attack abreast
We've got to cross those three
folds of ground. You see? Then
once we're beyond them, we've got
to attack the hill.

WELSH
We're supposed to cross that open
field?

STEIN

(guiltily)
The Colonel says there's no way to
outflank it. We have to take it
head on, by frontal assault. We've
drawn the worst assignment. Whyte,
Blane - you see those grassy ridges
at the end of the field? Just at
the foot of the hill? When you get
to the end of the field, you're to
locate and eliminate the hidden
strongpoints on those ridges. I
can't see any sign of them, but the
Japs must have something there, to
protect the approaches... We move
out in twenty minutes. When you
hear the whistles.

EXT. FOLDS OF GROUND - THE ATTACK - DAY

Batteries of 105 HOWITZERS begin to blast away, joined by
81mm mortars and the 155mm guns of the Americal's 221st Field
Artillery Battalion,-in the first time-on target attack of
the war. P-39s and Air Cobras fly in low to strafe and drop
500-pound demolition bombs on the Japanese positions. Stein
looks at his watch. WHISTLES begin to blow up and down the
line as C-for-Charlie goes to the attack. The men have no
recourse except to begin to move. Minds cast frantically
about for legitimate last-minute excuses, and find none.
Though they prefer not to believe it, the moment has come.

Nervous fear and anxiety, contained so long and with such
effort in order to appear brave, now begins to come out in
yelled exhortations and yelps of gross false enthusiasm. They
move up the slope, and in bunches, crouching low and carrying
their rifles in one or both hands, they hop over the crest
and commence to run sideways and crouching down the short
forward slope to the flat, rocky field in front.
49.

By the time Stein looks up, 1st and 2nd Platoons are passing
out of sight beyond the first of the swells that lies across
their line of advance. They are fifty yards ahead and appear
well deployed. Close by, directly in front of him, his
reserve 3rd Platoon is spread out and flattened behind the
first swell. with them are the company HQ and the mortar
section. Most of them are looking at him with blazing,
astonished eyes.

The 1st Platoon spreads out and flattens itself behind the
middle of the three little swells of ground. The 2nd Platoon
crouches in the trough behind them. Gordon's little flying
fox trembles inside his shirt-front.

Stein moves to the first swell. Young LT. WHYTE peeps over
the crest at the third swell. Seeing nothing, he motions for
his two scouts to proceed there, using an additional hand-and-
arm Signal meaning "speed." The BOOMING and BANGING and
RACKETING in the air does not seem to come from any one place
or several places, but simply hangs and jounces in the air,
sourceless. Whyte can see no visual end results of so much
banging and exploding. His two scouts still not having moved,
Whyte becomes angry and opens his mouth and bellows at them,
motioning again. Both of them stare at him as though they
thought him insane for even suggesting such a thing, but this
time, after a moment, they move. Almost side by side, they
leap up, cross the crest and run crouching down to the low
area where they flatten themselves. Whyte jumps up, making a
sweeping forward motion with his arm, and runs forward, his
platoon behind him. 2nd Platoon moves to the top of the
middle swell.

Back at the first swell, Stein watches this move and feels a
little reassured. He raises himself to his knees, his face
and whole patches of his skin twitching with mad alarm, to
see ist Platoon arrive at the last swell and that Lt. Whyte
is on the verge of making a bad tactical blunder.

It seems strange to Whyte, truly astonishing, that he has
arrived at the third and last fold of ground without a
casualty. What are the Japanese up to?

DOLL
Maybe they've pulled out.

Whyte shakes his head. This would be too optimistic. while
his men flatten themselves and stare at him with intense
sweating faces, he raises himself cautiously on his elbows
till only his eyes show, and inspects the terrain. He cannot
see anything that looks like Japanese or their emplacements.
Whyte is scared, but his anxiety to do well today is
stronger.
50.

He takes another look at the terrain ahead -- it is sucha
short distance to the first ridge of the hill -- and then
motions his scouts forward.

Once again the two riflemen stare at him as though they think
he has lost his mind, as though they would like to reason
with him if they didn't fear losing their reputations. Again
Whyte motions them forward, jerking his arm up and down in
the signal for speed. It seems eerily quiet, in the aftermath
of the barrage, though now and then the mortars behind them
GONG away. The scouts look at each other, then, gathering
themselves on hands and knees first, bounce up and sprint
twenty-five yards down into the last of the low areas and
fall down flat. After a moment, in which they inspect and
find themselves still alive, they gather themselves again. On
hands and knees, preparing to rise, the first one suddenly
falls down flat and ounces; the second, a little way behind
him, gets a little further up so that, when he falls, he
tumbles on his shoulder and rolls onto his back. And there
they lie, both-victims of well-placed rifle shots by unseen
riflemen. Neither moves again. Whyte stares at them shocked.
He has heard no shots, nor has he seen anything move. what is
he supposed to do now? There is nobody to tell him.

WHYTE
Come on, boys! Let’s go get ‘em!

He leaps to his feet motioning the platoon forward. He takes
two step s and falls down dead, stitched diagonally from hip
to shoulder by BULLETS.

COOMBS
I saw him die! I saw a man die!

Five others of Whyte’s platoon go down with him almost
simultaneously, some dead, some only nicked. But the impetus
Whyte has inaugurated remains, and the platoon charges
blindly on. Behind them, over the top of the third swell,
suddenly comes the 2nd Platoon in full career, yelling
hoarsely. Nine men fall at once. Two die, one of them is
their 2nd Lt. Blane, unluckily chosen as target by three
separate riflemen.

MORTAR SHELLS begin to drop in onto the 1st Platoon twenty-
five yards ahead. First two, then a single, then three
together pop up in unbelievable mushrooms of dirt and stones.
Shards and pieces wicker and WHIR in the air.

In the 2nd Platoon S/Sgt. Keck, watched by everyone now with
Lt. Blane down, throws out his arms and bellows like the
combined voices of ten men for them to "Hit dirt! Hit dirt!"
Running men melt into the earth as if a strong wind had come
up and blown them over like dried stalks. They disappear.
51.

1st Platoon reaches the bottom of the ridge, a long hillock
really, and dives into the waist-high grass which skirts it,
hiding from the hidden MGs above them and protecting
themselves from the enemy mortars. Those who cannot reach the
grass are hosed to earth and hiding by the machine guns, or
bowled over stunned by the mortars, before they can hide or
get close enough to the ridge to escape the fire. The late
Lt. Whyte's nineteenth-century charge is over.

Private Bell of the 2nd Platoon lies sprawled exactly as his
body has skidded to a halt, without moving a muscle. He
closes his eyes and listens. On the little ridges the
prolonged yammering of the MGs has stopped and now confined
itself to SHORT BURSTS at specific targets. Here and there
wounded men bellow, whine or whimper. Bell has never known
such eviscerating, ball-shrinking terror.

BELL
Hey, Keck! Hey, Keck! We got to get
out of here.

KECK
I know it.

BELL
Can you see them? Can you see where
any of them are?

KECK
No.

BELL
What'll we do?

JAPANESE (0.S.)
We know you there, Yank. Yank, we
know you there.

KECK
Tojo eats shit!

He is answered by an angry burst of machine gun FIRE.

JAPANESE (0.S.)
Roozover’ eat shit!

KIRK (0.S.)
You goddamn right he does!

When the firing stops, Bell calls softly again.

BELL
What’11 we do, Keck?
52.

KECK
Listen. All you guys listen. Pass
it along so everybody knows. When I
holler go, everybody up. Load and
lock; have a nuther clip in yore
hand. 1st Squad stay put, kneeling
position,. fire covering fire. 2nd
and 3rd Squads hightail it back
over that fold. 1st Squad fire two
clips, then scoot. 2nd and 3rd fire
covering fire from that fold. If
you can’t see nothin’, fire
searching fire. Space yore shots.
Them positions is about halfway up
them ridges. Everybody got it? Then
-- GO!

The slope comes to life. Bell leaps up running, his legs
already pistoning before the leap comes down to earth. Safe
beyond the little fold of ground, which by now has taken on
characteristics of huge size, he whirls and begins to FIRE
cover. When 2nd and 3rd Squads come diving and tumbling back
over the tiny crest, Bell is content to throw himself prone,
press his cheek to the earth, shut his eyes and lie there.

VOICE
God, oh, God! why am I here!

Apparently, Keck's plan has worked very well. 2nd and 3rd
Squads, having the surprise, have gotten back untouched; and
1st Squad has had only two men hit. Bell is looking right at
one of them as, running hard with his head down, the man (a
boy, named KLINE) jerks his head up suddenly, his eyes wide
with start and fright, and cries out "Oh!", his mouth a round
pursed hole in his face, and goes down. Anguished cries of
"Medic! Medic!" are beginning to be raised now here and there
across the field.

Back at the CP behind the first swell, Stein watches. Seeing
that their Captain can safely stand up on his knees without
being pumped full of holes or mangled, others are now doing
it. He is setting them a pretty good example, Stein thinks
still a little astonished by his own bravery. He calls his
two company AIDMEN over.

STEIN
You two fellows better get on up
there. I expect they need you.

FIRST MEDIC
Yes, sir.
53.

STEIN
Go by rushes, if you think you have
to.
(as they disappear )
I need a runner! A volunteer!

Not a single figure moves to come forward or answers him.
Stein stares back at them, disbelieving.

STEIN
I -- can't see what happened up
there. I need someone to go up
there and find out what's happened.

Charlie Dale, the second cook, appears at his elbow, scowling
with intensity, his face dark and excited.

DALE
I'll go, sir.

Stein watches him go trotting off bent over at the waist

then looks back at the rest of them, somewhat restored. There
are now twelve men standing on their knees in a group around
Stein, trying to see what is going on up front. Fife is not,
however, one of these. Fife is absolutely flattened out as he
can get, staring at flies stirring in the grass. His rage is
broken off short by the buzzing WHISTLE of the soundpower
phone that Stein has given him care of.

FIFE
Yes?

COL. TALL (V.0.)
What do you mean, "yes"?

FIFE
I mean this is Charlie Cat Seven.
Over.

COL. TALL (V.0.)
That's better. This is Seven Cat
Ace. Colonel Tall here. I want
Captain Stein. Over.

FIFE
Yes, sir. He’s right here.
(to Stein)

Colonel Tall wants you.

Stein lies down and takes the phone. Despite the din, both he
and Fife beside him can hear the colonel clearly. Stein has
been caught off guard;
54.

he did not expect to be called upon to offer explanations so
soon. What he hears astounds him to speechlessness.

COL. TALL (V.0.)
Magnificent, Stein, magnificent!
The finest thing these old eyes
have seen in a long time.
Beautifully conceived, beautifully
executed. You'll be mentioned in
Battalion Orders, Stein. Your men
came through for you. Over.

STEIN
Yes, sir. Over.

COL. TALL (V.0.)
Best sacrificial commitment to
develop a hidden position I have
ever seen outside maneuvers. Young
Whyte led beautifully. I'm
mentioning him, too. I saw him go
down in that first melee. Was he
hurt bad? But sending in your 2nd
too was brilliant. They might very
well have carried the ridge, with
luck. I don't think they were hurt
too bad. Blane led well too. How
many of the emplacements did they
locate? Did they knock out any? We
ought to have those ridges cleaned
out by noon. Hello? Hello, Stein?
Over?

STEIN
Yes, sir. Here, sir. Over.

COL. TALL (V.0.)
Thought you'd been hit. I said, how
many of the emplacements did they
locate? Did they knock any of them
out? Over.

STEIN
I don't know. Over.

COL. TALL (V.0.)
What do you mean you don't know?
How can you not know? Over

Stein finds himself in a quandary. He cannot admit what both
he and Fife know, which is that he knows nothing about
Whyte's attack, did not order it, and until now has believed
it bad.
55.

STEIN
I'm back here. Behind the first
swell. Do you want me to stand up?
And wave? Over.

COL. TALL (V.0.)
No. I can see where you are. I want
you to do something. I want you to
getup there and see what the
situation is, Stein. I want Hill
210 in my hands tonight. To do that
I have to have those two ridges by
noon. The Admiral got up at dawn
for this. Come to life down there,
Stein. Out.

STEIN
(to Welsh)
Let's move up.

While Stein's Company HQ is trooping forward to the second of
the swells, the 1st Platoon continues to lie flat. After the
first crash and volley and thunder of mortars they all
expected to be dead in five minutes. Now, it seems
unbelievable but the Japanese do not seem to be able to see
them very well.

The two company aidmen have moved courageously up amongst 2nd
Platoon and begun little sorties out after the wounded. In
all there are fifteen wounded men, and six dead. The aidmen
do not bother with the dead, but slowly they retrieve for the
stretcher-bearers all of the wounded.

Bell watches them, astonished. With insouciance, the two of
them move up and down the slope of the last swell, bandaging
and salting, dragging and half-carrying. MORTAR SHELLS knock
them down, MG FIRE kicks up dirt around them, but nothing
touches them. They clump untouchably on, helping the sobbing,
near-helpless men.

EXT. HILLSIDE (WITT AND HOKE AMONG THE WOUNDED) - DAY

Witt works as a stretcher-bearer. He receives the wounded
from the aidmen and does what he can to comfort them. They
bleed. They cry. They beg for water. He puts his canteen to
their lips; he listens; he smooths their hair. He feels
strangely close to them.

The other men look on the wounded with fear and a hushed awe.
They keep their distance, though they cannot help but be
curious; fresh blood is so very red. It is all obscene
somehow .
56.

Something which they feel should not be looked at, but which
they are compelled to look at, with guilty darting glances.

EXT. GRASS AT THE FOOT OF THE RIDGE - DAY

It is Doll who sees the first Japanese. Sensing the movement
around him as men begin to stir and call softly to each
other, he raises his head until his eyes show above the
slight depression into which he has sprawled. He sees three
figures carrying what could only be a machine gun still
attached to its tripod start across the slope back toward
Hill 210.

Doll slides his rifle up, raises the sight four clicks and,
lying with only his left arm and shoulder outside his little
hole, sights on the man in front, leading him a little, and
squeezes off a SHOT. The rifle bucks his shoulder and the man
goes down. The two men behind jump sideways together, like a
pair of skittish, delicately coordinated horses, and run on.

DOLL
I got him! I got him!

Doll has killed his first Japanese. For that matter, his
first human being of any kind. He feels an impulse to grina
silly grin and to laugh.

All at once a mortar shell SIGHS down and ten yards away
EXPLODES in a fountain of terror and dirt, and Doll discovers
his confidence hasn't been helped so much after all. After a
moment, he again puts his head up a little. This time he sees
four Japanese preparing to leave the grassy ridge and head up
toward the top of Hill 210. They come into si Doll from
somewhere on the ridge already running. Doll pulls his rifle
up into position and fires off FOUR SHOTS. He misses each
time. The Japanese disappear into the rocks.

DOLL
Hey, Queen! You there? You see them
Japs leavin’ that left ridge?

QUEEN
I ain’t been seein’ much of
nothin’.

DOLL

Well, why don't you get your
fuckin’ head up and look around?

QUEEN
Go fuck yourself, Doll.
57.

DOLL
No, I'm serious. I counted seven
Japs leavin’ that left-hand grassy
ridge. I got me one of ‘em.

QUEEN
So?

DOLL
I think they're pullin’ out of
there. Maybe somebody ought to tell
the Captain.

QUEEN
You want to be the one?

DOLL
Why not? Sure. I'll carry the
message back to Bugger for you.

QUEEN
You'll do no such goddamn fucking
thing. You'll stay right the fuck
where you are and shut up. That's
an order.

Doll does not answer for a moment. Slowly his heart returns

to normal.

He offered and he was refused.

QUEEN
They'll get us out of this ina
little bit. Somebody will. You stay
put. I'm ordering you.

But the thing that is driving Doll, eating on him, doesn't
recede. He has a strange tingling all through his belly and
crotch. Off to his right there is a sudden burst of MG FIRE
his ear now knows as Japanese, and immediately after it a CRY

of pain.

DOLL
Sounds like Stearns.

STEARNS
Not my legs! Not my legs! Aidman!
Aidman! I'll be all right! Just
show me where to go!

The tingling in Doll gets stronger and his heart begins to
pound again. He has never in his life been excited quite like
this. Somebody has to get that news to Bugger. Somebody has
to be a -- hero. And at once he goes,, up in a flash and
running, bent over, his rifle in both hands.
58.

A BULLET kicks up dirt two feet to his left and he zigs
right. Ten yards further on he zags left. Then, twenty yards
further, he nearly collides with Dale, who is just coming up
to get their news.

DOLL
Where you going, fuckface?

DALE
I'm s’pose to find out what's going
on with you people.

DOLL
They sendin’ out cooks? They must
be in bad shape back there.

He hurries on past Dale without even looking back. Dale's
ears burn with the unprovoked insult. A feral pig flushes
from its hiding place in the bushes nearby. Dale SHCJTS at it
but misses.

Behind the second little swell Doll runs almost head-on into
Capt. Stein. He comes trotting up, bent over, giggling and
laughing, so out of breath he cannot talk. Welsh eyes him
contemptuously.

STEIN
What are you laughing at?

DOLL
I think they're pullin’ completely
out of there, sir.

STEIN
Who sent you back here?

DOLL
Nobody , sir. I came myself. I
thought it was something you'd want

to know.

STEIN
You're right. It is. I won't forget
it, Doll.

Doll does not answer, but grins and turns to Fife.

DOLL
That was exciting. More than all
the hunting, gambling and fucking I
ever done. All rolled up together.
59.

STEIN
God damn it, get down! George, get
a man with glasses and have him
spot the back of that ridge. I want
to know the second anybody leaves
it. Take mine.

LT. BAND
I'll do it myself.

Stein gives his binoculars to ist Lt. Band, his exec, then
turns back to Doll and begins to question him about the
attack, casualties, the present position of the platoon.
While they are talking Welsh looks over the crest at the 2nd
Platoon flattened out and looking back this way, watching
their commander, who conceivably might order them to go over
the crest again.

STEIN
You're not really pinned down
then. I was told --

DOLL
Well, we are, in a way, sir. But
like you see, I got back all right.
We couldn't all come back at once.
But two or three at a time could
make it, I think. With 2nd Platoon
firing covering fire.

STEIN
We don't even know where those
goddamned fucking emplacements are.

DOLL
They could fire searching fire,
couldn't they?

Stein glares at him. So does Welsh. Welsh wants to boot the
new hero in the ass: already giving the company commander
advice!

WELSH
Cap’n? You want me to go out there
and get them men back here for you?

STEIN
No. No, I can't spare you. Might
need you. Anyway, I think I'll
leave them there a while.

(MORE)
60.

They don't Sdéaim (tanrbie' @Ptting hurt
too bad and if we can get up onto
that right ridge frontally maybe
they can flank it.

LT. BAND
Hey, Jim! Hey, Captain Stein! I
just saw five more leaving the left
ridge, with two MGs. I think they
really are pulling out.

STEIN
Really? Really?

Now he hears a voice behind him and looks around to see Dale
staring at him with his narrow close-set eyes snapping
bright.

DALE
Captain, are there any more jobs
you got for me to do?

STEIN
Yes, Dale. You --

Stein is interrupted by the EXPLOSION of a mortar shell
amongst the 2nd Platoon on the swell just ahead of them. Its
thronging bang is almost simultaneous with a loud SCREAM of
pure fear. A man has thrown himself out of the line back down
the slope and is bucking and kicking and rolling with both
hands pressed behind him in the small of his back.

WELSH
I don't think they can see us any
better than we can see them.

The screaming takes on a new tone, one of realization, rather
than the start and surprise and pure fear of before. One of
the aidmen rushes out to Jacques and, with the help of two
men from 2nd Platoon, tears open his shirt and gets a syrette
of morphine into him. In a few seconds he quiets. The aidman
shrugs with despair. Stein is white-faced, his lips tight.
This is the first of his men he has actually seen wounded.

STEIN
Stretcher-bearers! I believe that's
Private Jacques.

LT. BAND
But, Jim. Really, Jim, I don't --
There's other men wounded.
61.

STEIN
God damn you, George, shut up!
Leave me alone!

The stretcher-bearers arrive out of breath. Stein points over
the crest to where the aidman still kneels by the casualty.

STEIN
Go get that man.

Hoke, the lead stretcher-bearer, plainly thought someone of
the CP group here was wounded. Now he sees his mistake.

STRETCHER-BEARER (HOKE)
We already got eight or nine down
there now that we're not supposed
to -- We're not --

STEIN
God damn it, don't argue withe me!
I'm Captain Stein! Go get that man
I said!

Hoke recoils, upset. Of course nobody is wearing insignia.

LT. BAND
But, Jim, really, he's not --

STEIN
God damn you, all of you! Am I in
command around here or not! Am I
company commander of this outfit or
am I not! Am I a captain or a
goddamned private! Do I give the
orders here or don't I! That man
may die. He's hit bad. Get him back
to Battalion Aid Station. See if
they can't do something to save
him.

STRETCHER-BEARER (HOKE)
Yes, sir. We got others that’re hit
bad, sir. That was all I meant. we
got three down there might die any
minute.

LT. BAND
That's it, Jim. Don't you see?
Don't you think he ought to wait
his turn? Isn't that only fair?

STEIN
Wait his turn? Wait his turn? Fair?
62.

LT. BAND
Why put him ahead of some other
guy?

STEIN

Go and get him, like I told you.
Back to Battalion Aid Station. I
gave you an order, Private.

STRETCHER-BEARER (HOKE)
Yes, sir. Come on, you guys. We're
goin’ after that guy.

STRETCHER-BEARER (WITT)
Well what the hell’re we waitin’
for? Come on, Hoke. Or are you
afraid of gettin’ that close to the
shooting?

STRETCHER-BEARER (HOKE)
You shut up, Witt. Let me alone.

The man he has addressed stands up suddenly. With a rapacious
grin he marches up to where Welsh half-reclines.

WITT
Hello, Firs’ Sarn’t.

Only then do Stein, or any of the rest of the C-for-Charlie
men for that matter, recognize that this Witt is their Witt,
the same that Stein and Welsh combined to transfer out of the
company. All of them are astonished, as Witt has obviously
meant for them to be.

FIFE
By God! Hello, Witt! What’re you
doing here?

True to his promise of a few days before, Witt passes his
narrow eyes across his friend as if Fife did not exist. They
come to rest on Welsh again. Welsh seems to peer into him.

STORM
You must be out of your mind. You
must be crazy.

WELSH
Hi, Witt. You in the medics now?
You better get down.

Stein, who has felt guilty about shipping Witt out when he
knew how badly Witt wanted to stay, even though he still
feels he did what was best for his company, says nothing.
63.

Witt ignores Welsh's cautioning and remains standing straight
up.

WITT
Naw, Firs’ Sarn’t, I'm still in
Cannon Comp’ny. Where you put me.
Only we ain’t got no cannons. who
we goin’ after over there, Firs’
Sarn’t?

WELSH
Jacques.

WITT
Old Jockey? Shit, that's too bad.

His three companions have already gone on and are now running
downhill toward the wounded man. Witt turns to follow them,
but then he turns back and speaks directly to Stein.

WITT
Please, sir, can I come back to the
company? After we get Jockey back
to Battalion? I can slip away easy.
They'11 give Hoke another man. Can
I, sir?

STEIN
Well, I -- Of course, you'll have
to get permission.

WITT
Sure. And my rifle. Thank you, sir.

He exchanges a look with Welsh, who turns to Stein as though
to protest this decision. Then, continuing to ignore Fife, he
turns and follows after his companions. Stein stares after
him. For a man to want to come back into a forward rifle
company in the midst of an attack is simply incomprehensible.
In a way, though, it is very romantic -- like something out
of Kipling.

Fife lies flat and shuts his eyes. Even though he knows that
Witt's gesture of ignoring him has to do with their argument
of a few days back, he cannot help taking it as contempt and
disgust for his present cowardice -- as if Witt with one
glance had looked inside his mind. when he reopens his eyes,
he finds himself looking into the pleading white face of
little Bead a few feet away.
64.

DALE
First chance I hadda be free of
that goddamn Storm and all them
cooks cooking up a bunch of shit
for people to gorge their guts on.
First chance I had to talk to the
Comp'ny C'mander, personally, like
this.

Fife looks at him in astonishment. For one thing, it is a
long time since anyone heard Charlie Dale string this many
sentences together. He really does seem to be enjoying it,
especially watching Storm all flattened out beside Sgt.
Welsh.

DALE
People are starting to rekinize me.
(glancing at Storm)
Hour ago that dumb fuck was giving
me orders.

STEIN

We know the Japs have vacated the
ridge on the left. Dale, you go to
3rd Platoon, tell them to move up
and occupy it. Report to Lieutenant
Gore if you can find him. Tell him
I don't want to lose any more men
than he has to. Get back as soon as
you can.

DALE
Aye, aye, sir.

STEIN
I want both you and Doll to stay
with me. I'll have further work for
both of you. You've both been
invaluable.

DALE
Yes, sir.

Dale snaps out a tiny little salute and takes off, running
bent over along the low area behind the fold.

STEIN
The ridge on the right is going to
be the trouble spot. The main
strongpoint is there. Doll, you go
back and tell 1st Platoon I want
them to fire cover. Go!
65.

Doll moves off reluctantly. He did not intend, when he first
came back, to set himself up as a troubleshooting messenger
to dangerous areas for Bugger Stein.

STEIN

2nd Platoon will make the attack.
Sgt. Keck, as 2nd Platoon leader,
you're to lead it.

(guiltily)
You'll take three squads and attack
up the ridge. It won't be easy.
Crawl up the slope as far as you
can get, until they discover you.
Then attack. The rest of us will
move forward to support you. We're
going after them, men.

Keck listens, astonished. It will be a frontal attack
uphill, under heavy fire.

Meanwhile, Doll passes up through 2nd Platoon, at the third
swell. The men, cheeks pressed to the earth, stare at him
with indifferent, sullen curiosity. He is aware that his eyes
are narrowed, his nostrils flared, his jaw set. He makes a
handsome picture of a soldier for the 2nd Platoon men who
watch him. Then he is up and running. Some bullets kick up
dirt to right and left. He zigs and zags. Finally, just ahead
of him, he sees a hand and arm shoot up into the air, the
hand describing the old circular hand-and-arm signal for
"Gather here." Doll pulls up to find Queen lying placidly on
his side and grinning up at him ruefully, his rifle hugged
against his chest.

QUEEN
Come right in.

EXT. SECOND FOLD TO THIRD FOLD - DAY

Stein begins to move forward. Patches of flesh on his face
twitch uncontrollably. From behind the third swell he will
mount the attack and observe it too. He wonders if the men
can tell his nerves are wearing thin. In the first place he
can never be sure that what he is doing is right, might not
be done better and with less cost in some other way. Danger
flickers and blinks in the air like a faulty neon tube.
Whenever he stands up he might be struck by a bullet
Whenever he moves a few feet he might be moving under a
descending mortar shell.

He is turning these things over in his mind when Fife holds
the phone up to his ear. He is dumbfounded to hear the
Colonel shouting at him that he is too far to the right.
66.

He is not even given an opportunity to explain his proposed

attack.

STEIN
I don't understand. What do you
mean -- too far to the right?

They've evacuated the left-hand
grassy ridge. My 3rd Platoon's
moving up to occupy it. Over.

COL. TALL (V.0.)

God damn it, Stein! I'm telling you
your left flank's exposed. Do' you
know what it is to expose your
flank? Did you ever read ina
tactics manual about exposing your
left flank? Damn it, you've got to
move down there! You're not moving!
Over.

STEIN
God damn it, Colonel, right now, as
you call, we're moving out to
attack the right-hand grassy ridge.
Over. God damn it.

COL. TALL (V.0.)
Stein, you're too far right
already! You're sideslipping to the
right alla time. I've decided to
commit the reserve company on your

left -- with orders to attack!
Orders to attack, Stein, you hear?
Over.

STEIN

Do you want me to go ahead with my
attack? Over.

COL. TALL (V.0.)
What else? What else, Stein? You're
not supposed to be down there ona
goddamned asshole vacation. Get
cracking! Out.

Stein looks over the terrain that lies ahead of them. He
points its geography out to Band, Welsh and Keck

STEIN
The first problem will be getting
the men from here across that
bareass field to the foot of the
ridge. It'll be safer there.
(MORE)
67.
We'll be rSgiHIN(raya'ihst them, too

close to hit us with their MGs and
mortars. There's your ridge, Keck.
You see?

Suddenly Dale appears, running bent over at the waist in that
peculiar fashion everybody instinctively adopts. Rifle and MG
FIRE hit the ground all around him, but nothing touches him,
and he arrives among them a hero. Everyone within reach slaps
him on the back as he makes his way to Stein to give his
report.

DALE
They’re okay. 3rd Platoon's
occupied the ridge on the left.

Stein sees a lone figure hurry toward him. It is Witt, with
his rifle and some extra bandoliers. At the same time, Pfc
Doll returns from his hazardous mission to 1st Platoon.
Everything is building toward the moment of truth.

DOLL
Found Queen. They're ready.

STEIN
Dale, if you want to go out with
these others when they make the
attack, I'll make you an acting
sergeant right now and put you in
command of the extra squad. Do you
want to do that?

DALE
Sure. Sure, sir. If you think I'm
capable, sir. If you think I can do
it.

STEIN
Okay. I make you an acting
sergeant. You'll go with the
others. Under the command of Keck

here.
DALE
Aye, sir. But don't you have to say
hereby?
STEIN
What?
DALE

I said: don't you have to say
hereby? You know, to make it
official.
68.

In some slow-stirring, labyrinthine depth of his animal's
mind Dale seems to be suspicious of Stein's honesty.

STEIN
No. I don't have to say anything
but what I've said. You're an
acting sergeant.

Dale turns to Doll and grins. While Doll gathers his breath
and stricken sense of justice, Witt asks permission to join
the attack force. He seems to enjoy Welsh's look of
exasperation.

WITT
Can I go, sir? I'm ready.

DOLL
Can I go too, sir?

Stein, unable to hide his stunned disbelief, nods his
agreement. It gives him a terrible feeling of moral
culpability to choose which men to send in. Some of them will
surely die, and he does not want to decide which ones. Let
Luck choose, or whatever agency runs the lives of men.

STEIN
All right, yes. Thank you, Doll.

Doll crawls away biting the inside of his lip so hard that it
brings tears to his eyes. Fife watches him bang his head
violently against a rock, his whole body writhing like a
snake's. Why does he do things like this to himself? Why
can't he keep his mouth shut?

STEIN
All right, Keck. When they're all
there, space them out. Advance by
rushes. You might as well go. we're
counting on you.

KECK
Listen, Cap’n. There's somethin’ I
wanted to tell you. That guy Bell
is a good man. Pretty steady. He
helped me get going and get the
platoon out of that hole we were in
after that charge. I just wanted to
tell you.

STEIN
Okay, I'll remember. Take care of
yourself, Keck. I need you.
69.

KECK
I'll take care of myself as good as
anybody can around here.

LT. BAND
Give them hell, Sergeant! Give them
hell!

The two attacking squads soon separate themselves from the
other half of the platoon. Most of them, in their bodily
attitudes and in their faces, resemble sheep about to be led
to the slaughter pens in Chicago. They wait. Keck has only to
crawl to them.

KECK
Okay, you guys. This is it. We're
goin’ down in groups of four. No
point in goin’ by rushes, only make
a better target stopped. Run all
the way. We ain't got any choice.
We're picked, so we got to go. I’1l
take the first bunch myself. I want
Charlie Dale with me. Dale? You can
organize them guys that's down
there. Let's move out.

He starts to crawl to the jump-off point just beyond the knot
of officers and CP men, and it is here that the first case of
overt cowardice occurs in C-for-Charlie. A big, beautifully
muscled man named SICO, an Italian draftee from Philly,
suddenly sits down in his tracks and begins to hold his
stomach and groan.

KECK
Get up, God damn you, Sico. Or Ill
kick you so hard in that stomach
you'll really be sick.

SICO
I can't, Sergeant. I would if I
could. You know I would. I'm sick.

KECK
Sick, my foot.

WELSH
Hold it', Keck. What is it, Sico?

SICO
I don't know, Sergeant. It's my
stomach. Pains. Cramps. I can't
straighten up. I'm sick.
70.

As if to prove it he suddenly vomits. He does not even try to
bend over and the vomit burps up out of him and runs down
over his fatigue shirt onto his hands which hold his belly.
He looks at Welsh hopefully out of the dark, tortured holes
of his eyes, but appears ready to do it again if necessary.

WELSH
Leave him.
(to Sico)
Come on. The medics will take care
of you, Sico.

SICO
Thank you, Sergeant.

Keck seems to want to protest. Witt studies the scene.
Welsh's indulgence is curious to him.

WELSH
Don't argue with me.

Sico continues to sit and watch the others pass. He groans
audibly from time to time and now and then he gags, but
apparently does not feel it necessary to vomit more. His face
looks haunted and his eyes tormented.

Keck's men begin to run the gauntlet. Each squad sergeant -
first Milly Becker, then McCron -- supervises the jump-off of
his men in groups of four. All of them make it down safely
except two. Of these, one, a Mississippi farmer named Catt

is killed outright. The other, Pvt Alfredo Tella, hit
running, falls, bounces hard and moans like a boy who has
taken a spill from his bicycle.

Unfortunately, the Japanese heavy mortars, still firmly
seated on the heights of Hill 210, have seen the forward
movement of American troops, too. Shells begin EXPLODING
their fountains of terror, dirt and fragments as the Japanese
gunners finger the area.

EXT. GRASSY SLOPE (KECK’S ATTACK) - DAY

Keck spreads his men out in a line and then gives the order
to crawl. The grass is about chest-high here and has a
matted, tangled underhayer of old stems. It chokes them with
dust, ties up their arms and feet, makes it impossible to
see. They crawl for what seems an eternity, expecting the
Japanese to open up at any moment. It requires tremendous
exertion. Most of them have long since used up all of their
water. Halfway up the slope Keck orders them to stop.
71.

For a moment he lies gathering his will power and thinks
about their faces. Then, taking a deep breath he stands up
straight in the grass.

KECK
Up! Up! Go!

They rise in a line and begin to scamper uphill, FIRING as
they go. Almost immediately the MGs begin to HAMMER, and at
once men begin to fall. The fury of the Japanese fire strikes
them like a wind-tormented hailstorm. The Japanese have been
smart and have waited, conserving their fire till they have
targets. Four men of McCron’s squad go down at once. On the
right, a young draftee named Wynn is shot in the throat and
screams, "Oh, my God!" in a voice of terror and disbelief as
a geyser of blood spurts from his neck. Next to him, another
soldier, is caught in the face, perhaps from the same burst
He goes down without a sound, looking as if he's been hit in
the face with a tomato. All this is apparently too much for
McCron, who has clucked over and mothered this squad for
months, and he simply drops his rifle and sits down crying.

Dale, on the left, sees the first emplacement, the first live
one any of them has ever actually seen. It is a one-gun job,
a simple hole dug in the ground and covered over with sticks
and kunai grass. From the dark opening he can see the muzzle
SPITTING FIRE at him. So far Dale has not fired a shot. what
is the point, when there are no targets? But now, seeing the
emplacement, he carefully releases his safety and FIRES a
long burst with his Thompson gun, straight into the hole
twenty yards away. Before he can release the trigger the gun
jams solidly. But his burst is enough to stop the machine
gun, at least momentarily, and Dale runs toward it pulling a
grenade from his shirt. From ten yards away he throws the
grenade like a baseball, wrenching hell out of his shoulder.
The grenade disappears through the hole, then BLOWS UP,
scattering sticks and grass and three rag dolls and upending
the machine gun. Dale turns back to his squad, licking his
lips and grinning with beady pride.

MGs still hammer at them from seemingly every quarter of the
globe. Men are still going down. They still have not located
any main strongpoints. Directly in front of them thirty yards
away, there is a winding gully and four-foot cut which
extends clear across their front.

Instinctively everyone begins to run for that. They dive in
behind its protection pell-mell, sobbing with exhaustion. The
exertion and the heat have been too much. Several men vomit
One man gurgles once senselessly, then -- his eyes rolling
back in his head -- faints from heat prostration. They lie
against the ledge in the midday sun and smell the hot, summer-
smelling dust. Insects HUM around them. The fire has stopped.
72.

DOLL
Well, what’re we gonna do now?

KECK
We're gonna stay right here. Maybe
they'll get some reinforcements up
to us.

DOLL
Ha! To do what?

KECK
To capture these goddamn fucking
positions around here! what you

think?

DOLL
You mean you really want to go on
with it?

KECK

I don't know. No. Not no uphill
charge. But they get us some
reinforcements, we can scout around
and maybe locate where all these
goddamn fucking MGs are. Anyway,
it's better than going back down
through that. You want to go back
down?

Nobody answers this, and Keck does not feel it necessary to
elaborate. Witt studies the ants crawling on the ground.

KECK
McCron’s gone. Bell, I'm appointing
you acting sergeant in his place.

BECKER
What if the Japs come down here in
force and throw us off of here?

KECK
I don't think they will. But we
better have a sentry. Doll.

WITT
Somethin’s comin’!

DOLL
They’re comin’! Somebody’s comin’!

AS one man the line behind the cut sweeps up and forward,
rifles ready.
73.

Forty yards away seven pot-headed, bandy-legged, starved-
looking Japanese men are running down-at them across an
ungrassed area carrying hand grenades in their right hands
and bayoneted rifles in their left. The massed rifle FIRE
from the ledge disposes of them quickly. Only one of them is
able even to throw; and his grenade, a dud, lands short. When
the fire ceases, only two bodies continue to move. Aiming
deliberately in the sudden quiet, Witt the Kentuckian puts a
killing round into each one of them.

WITT
You never can tell about them boys.
Even when they’re hit.

DOLL
Why’d they do it? If they wanted to
throw us out of here, why didn't
they come in force? Why just seven?
It don't figure.

DALE
Maybe they were doing it on their
own. Without orders.

They await a second, larger attack, but only four more
Japanese appear. Witt, who is the best marksman in the
regiment, quickly SHOOTS three down. Doll and Dale watch in
awe. Keck reaches in his hip pocket to pull out a grenade,
and-in the excitement he gets it by the pin. He and Bell
exchange a look of dizzying, near-fainting terror, then he
leaps back from the line and sits back against a little dirt
hammock, to protect the others. The grenade goes off with a
sickening THUD. They see there is nothing they can do for
him. His entire right buttock and much of his lower back have
been blown away.

KECK
What a fucking recruit trick to
pull.

BECKER
He jumped away -- so we wouldn't
get hit.

Bell and Doll sit with him while the others go back to the
line. They wipe the mud off his face and try to reassure him.

DOLL
We'll take care of you, Keck. I
swear to God we will! Just take it
easy.
74.

KECK
You guys write my old lady, will
you? Don't forget. I want her to
know I died like a man.

DOLL
Sure, sure. But nobody's gonna haf
to write your old lady. You'll come
out of this. We got stretcher-
bearers with us, remember?
Battalion Aid Station's movin' up
all the time. They'll have you back
to the docs in no time.

KECK
Bullshit. Don't bullshit me. I'm
cold.

BELL

There, there. Just take it easy.

KECK
You guys don't forget to write my
old lady I died like a man.

He sighs, first sign of the approaching breathlessness of
massive hemorrhage.

KECK
I grabbed it by the pin. This
fuckin’ mud on my face!

Bell wets his handkerchief and cleans Keck's face with it.
This seems to make him feel better. Becker turns from the cut
to signal the company to send reinforcements.

KECK
Just don't forget to write my old
lady I died like a man.

DOLL
Just take it easy. Don't talk like
that. You'll make it out of this.

KECK
Horseshit. I'm bleedin’ to death.
Ain't I?

He looks at Witt, who does not answer but watches him with
sympathy.
75.

KECK
See? Maybe it's just as good. I'm
all messed upon the crock. What if
I couldn't fuck no more? Just don't
forget to write my old lady I died
manly.

DOLL
Sure, sure. I'll write her. Just
take it easy.

Witt comes up. Doll and Bell drift away. Witt is calm and
cheerful in the presence of death; he does not look away. He
feels a bond with the dying man. The others are solemn,
embarrassed.

KECK
Aid Station’s never gonna get up
here. The medics either.

WITT
You're gonna be all right. Even if
you die. You didn't let your
brother down... Those flies
bothering you?

He whisks the flies away from Keck's face and waits. His eyes
express a deep understanding and tenderness.

WITT
We'll remember what you done. We
won't forget it. It won't be
wasted.

Keck looks at him uncomprehendingly. The others return. The
breathlessness has hit him; they know it won't be long.

KECK
I'm cold. Freezin’!

When he stops breathing, the men stand up.

BELL
You going to write his wife?

DOLL
Fuck no! I don't know his old lady.
That's the Company Commander's job
not mine. You out of your mind? I
ain't no good at writin’ letters.

BELL
You told him you would.
76.

DOLL

I say anything when they're like

that.
BELL

Somebody ought to do it.
DOLL

Then you write her.
BELL

I didn't tell him I would.
WITT

(to Doll)

You make me sick.

Squaring his shoulders, he stares at Doll, ready to fight him
then and there, in the midst of combat. Doll does not want a
fight. witt turns away in disgust. Charlie Dale comes over.

DALE
All over?

DOLL
Yeah.

THIRD FOLD TO CUT (WITH BINOCULAR MATTE) - DAY

Stein, through his binoculars, sees the men clustered around
the figure on the ground, two hundred yards away. Keck! Then
he sees that Sgt. Becker is looking at him -or anyway toward
him -- and making the Old Army hand-and-arm signal for
"Converge on me." He wants reinforcements. Exertion, nervous
exhaustion and fear are wearing Stein down.

STEIN
He wants help... That whole ridge
is a giant honeycomb of MG
emplacements. A regular fortress.
The attack's bogged down. They
aren't enough men. It'd take a full

company .

(to Band)
Twelve men down! I counted every
one of them. My men!... Now he

wants us to send more after them.

Suddenly Stein hears from near the foot of the ridge the
first thin, piping YELLS. They sound insane.
77.

What they lack in volume, they more than make up in their
penetrating qualities. They come in a series, each lasting
five full seconds. Then there is silence.

STEIN
What's that?

BAND
My God!

Band looks back at him with squinted, dilated eyes. From the
high grass out beyond them, high and shrill, the series of
yells comes again. They are not screams. Stein is able to
pick him out easily with the glasses, which brings him up
very close, too close for comfort. Pvt Tella -- he has fallen
at the bottom of the slope. Now he is trying to crawl back.
He has been hit squarely in the groin with a burst of heavy
MG fire which has torn his whole belly open. Lying on his
back, his head uphill, both hands pressed to his belly to
hold his intestines in, he is inching his way toward them.

STEIN
Tella. Medic!

LT. BAND
What are we gonna do?

From below the insane series of YELLS comes again, identical,
unchanging. Stein and Band aren't the only ones to hear them.
The entire remainder of the 2nd Platoon lying along the crest
of the swell have heard him. So has the Medic who is now
running bent over along the slope to Stein. Fife pricks his
ears. The mortar shells are still falling every minute or
two. Sometimes you can hear their fluttery SHU-ING sound for
two seconds before they hit; and Fife is completely
terrorized by them.

MEDIC
There's nothing anybody can do
that’ll help him. He'll be dead
before they can ever get him back
to a surgeon. He's got dirt all
over his bowels. Even sulfa won't
fix that. In these jungles?

STEIN
How long?

MEDIC
Two hours? Four, maybe? Maybe only
one. Maybe less.
The Medic

78.

STEIN
God damn it, man! We can't any of
us stand it that long! Not counting
him! And I can't ask you to go down
there.

 

studies the terrain. He blinks several times.

MEDIC
Maybe it's worth a try.

STEIN
You said yourself nobody could do
anything to help him.

MEDIC
At least I could get a syrette of
morphine into him.

STEIN
Would one be enough? I mean, you
know, would it keep him quiet?

MEDIC
Not for long. But I could give him
two. I could leave him three or
four for himself.

STEIN
Maybe he wouldn't take them. He's
delirious. Couldn't you just, sort
of, give them all to him at once?

MEDIC
That would kill him, sir. I
couldn't do that, I really
couldn't.

STEIN
Okay -- well, you want to try it?

From below the set, unchanging series of YELLS rises up to
them, precise, inflexible, a little quavery this time.

STEIN
I hope he doesn't begin to cry. God
damn it! My company won't have any
fighting spirit left at all if we
don't do something about him!
79.

MEDIC
I'll go, sir. After all, it's my
job. After all, it's worth a try,
isn't it, sir? To stop the yells.

STEIN
God, I don't know.

MEDIC
I'm volunteering. I've been down
there before. They won't hit me,

sir.

STEIN
You were on the left. It's not as
bad there.

MEDIC

I'm volunteering.
Agonized, Stein waits several seconds before he speaks.

STEIN
When do you want to go?

MEDIC
Any time. Right now.

STEIN
No, wait. At least I can give you
some covering fire.

MEDIC
I'd rather go now, sir. And get it
over with.

They have been lying side by side, their helmets almost
touching as they talk, and now Stein turns to look at the
boy. He cannot help wondering whether he has talked this boy
into volunteering.

STEIN
Okay. Go ahead.

The Medic nods, looking straight ahead this time, then
springs up into a crouch, and is gone over the crest of the
swell.

It is all over almost before it gets started. Running like
some fleeting forest animal, his medic's web equipment
flopping, he reaches the damaged Tella, swings round to face
him up the hill, then drops to his knees, his hands already
groping at the pouch which holds his syrettes.
80.

Before he can get the cap off the needle, one single MG OPENS
uP from the ridge stitching across the area. Stein and the
remnants of 2nd Platoon watch him jerk straight up, eyes and
mouth wide, face slack, not so much with disbelief or mental
shock as with sheer simple physiological surprise.

Stein waits. Seconds ago he was alive and Stein was talking
to him; now he is dead. Just like that. But Stein's attention
is pulled away before he can think more, pulled away by two
things. One is Tella, who now begins to scream in a high
babbling falsetto of hysteria totally different from his
former yells. Obviously he has been hit again, and while one
bloodstained hand tries to hold in his intestines, the other
gropes at the new wound in his chest.

DISTANT JAPANESE (0.S.)
Cly, Yank, cly! Yerl, Yank, yerl!

The next thing that catches Stein's attention is a figure
emerging from the grass fifty yards ahead and plodding
steadily toward them. Stein sees that it is his Sgt. McCron,
that he is wringing his hands and weeping. On his face two
great white streaks of clean skin run from eye to chin,
accentuating the eyes, as if he were wearing the haunting
makeup of a tragic actor in some Greek drama.

And on he comes, while behind him Japanese MGs and small arms
OPEN UP all across the ridge, making dirt puffs all around
him. Nothing touches him. At last he sits down beside his
Captain.

MCCRON
Dead. All dead, Cap’n. Every one.
I'm the only one. All twelve. Young
men. I looked after them. Taught
them everything I knew. It didn't
mean a thing. Dead. What more can
you do?

LT. BAND
They can't all be dead, McCron.

MCCRON
(in a rage)
I tried to help them! All gone!
They 're all gone! Wynn! Gordon!
Darl! Gwenne! Vincente! Mack!

STEIN
Medic! Take him back. Stay with
him. When you get back there, tell
them we need another medic now. At
least one.
81.

SECOND MEDIC
Yes, sir. Come on, Mac. That's it
Come on, boy. It'll be all right.
It'll be all right.

MCCRON
They're all dead. How can it be all
right? Why? Why? Why?

He allows himself to be led off by the arm. Stein sighs and
turns his attention back to Tella. The Italian is still
screaming his piercing wailing scream and does not seem to
show any indication that he is ever going to run down. If it
keeps on, it is going to unnerve them all. Stein does not
know what to do. He cannot send another man out there. A hot
unbelieving, outraged fury seizes him. And just then a large
green object of nature on his right rises up and bounds over
the crest of the swell, growling obscenities. Before Stein
can even yell the one word, "Welsh!", the First Sergeant is
careering across the field at full gallop toward the ridge.

WELSH AND TELLA (TRACK WITH WELSH)

Welsh sees everything before him with a furious clarity: the
rocky, thin-grassed field running off to the foot of the
ridge, mortar-and bullet-pocked, the hot bright sunshine and
deep cerulean sky, the incredibly white clouds above the
towering high-up horseshoe of Hill 210, the yellow serenity
of the ridge before him.

WELSH
Fuck you! Fuck you!

He charges on happily, zigzagging professionally . But when
he skids to a stop on his belly beside the mutilated Italian
boy, he realizes he has made no plans about what to do when
he arrives here.

WELSH
How goes it, kid?

Tella rolls his eyes around like a maddened horse until he
can see who it is. He does not stop his screaming.

WELSH
You got to be quiet. I came to help
you. Tella!

Finally the scream stops of itself, from lack of breath, and
Tella breathes, causing more blood to run from the hole in
his chest. When he speaks, it is only a few decibels lower
than the scream.
82.

TELLA
Fuck you! I'm dying! I'm dying,
Sarge! Look at me! Get away from
me! I'm dying!

WELSH
Okay, but goddamn it, do it with
less noise.

TEL LA
How you going to help me?

WELSH
Take you back.

TELLA
You can't take me back! You want to
help me, shoot me!

WELSH
(yelling in the noise)
You're off your rocker. You know I
can't do that.

TELLA
Sure you can! You got your rifle
there! Point it at me! You want to
help me, shoot me and get it over
with! I can't stand it! I'm scared!

WELSH
Does it hurt much?

TELLA
Sure it hurts, you dumb son of a
bitch! You can’t take me back

WELSH
We'll see. You stick with old
Welsh. Trust old Welsh. Did I ever
give you a bum steer?

He is aware now -- he knows -- that he won't be able to stay
much longer. Already he is flinching and jerking
uncontrollably under the fire. Crouching, he runs around to
Tella's head and gets him under the armpits and heaves.

TELLA
Aaa-eeeee! You're killing me!
You're pulling me apart! Put me
down, goddamn you! Put me down!

Welsh drops him quickly, by simple reflex. Too quickly.
83.

TELLA
You son of a bitch! You son of a
bitch! Leave me alone! Leave me
alone! Don't touch me! Why are you
touching me?

WELSH
(yelling)
Stop that yelling. It ain't
dignified. All right, we'll do it
this way, then.

Slipping one arm under the Italian's knees and the other
under his shoulders, he lifts.

TELLA
Aaa-eeeee! Put me down! Put me
down! You're breaking me in two!
Put me down! You'll kill me! You
son of a bitch! You fucker! You
bastard! I told you to leave me
alone! I never ast you to come down
here! Go away! Leave me alone! You
shiteater! Stay away from me!

Turning his head away and closing his eyes, he begins his
desperate, wailing, piercing scream again. Five yards above
them on the slope a line of machine gun BULLETS slowly
stitches itself across from left to right. With sudden,
desperate inspiration, Welsh leaps across the prostrate Tella
and begins rummaging in the dead Medic's belt pouches.

WELSH
Here! Tella! Take these! Tella!

Tella stops screaming and opens his eyes. Welsh tosses him
two morphine syrettes he has found and begins to attack
another pouch.

TELLA
More! More! Gimme more! More!

Welsh tosses him a double handful he has found in the other
pouch, and then turns to run. But something stops him.
Crouched like a sprinter at the gun, he turns his head and
looks at Tella one more time. Tella, already unscrewing the
cap from one of the syrettes, is looking at him feelingly,
his eyes wide and white.

TELLA
Goodbye! Goodbye, Welsh!
84.

WELSH
Goodbye, kid.

It is all he can think of to say. For that matter, it is all
he has time to say, because he is already off and running.
Bullets WHIR by his head. He runs and runs and then he falls
headlong over the little crest and just lies there, half-dead
from exhaustion.

STEIN
Sergeant, I saw the whole thing
through the glasses. I want you to
know I'm mentioning you in Orders
tomorrow. I'm recommending you for
the Silver Star. I can only say --

WELSH
Captain, if you say one word to
thank me, I will punch you square
in the nose. Right here. If you
ever so much as mention me in your
fucking orders, I will resign my
rating two minutes after, and leave
you to run this pore, busted-up
outfit by yourself. If I go to
jail. So fucking help me.

He shuts his eyes and rolls over away from Bugger, who says
nothing.

WELSH
Property! Property!

Witt has perceived Welsh's selfless aid to the dying man.
They glance at one another. Stein slowly crawls back to Fife
and the soundpower phone. His arm is trembling as he takes
the receiver. How long can he go on? How much longer can he
watch his men being killed in agony like this? His CP force
and the remnants of 2nd and 3rd Platoons watch him with white
eyes, as though looking to him and hoping he can in some way
get them out of this mess, so that they might go on living.

COL. TALL (V.0.)
Why aren't you following up your
attack and exploiting it? What's
the matter with you, Stein? Those
men should be reinforced
immediately. What are they doing? I
can see them through my glasses.
They're just lying behind that
ledge. They should be up and out
cleaning out those machine guns.
Over.
STEIN
I don't think you understand what's
going on down here, sir. We're
taking a lot of fire. We've had
heavy casualties. I was planning to
reinforce them right away;
something bad happened. We had a
man -- gut shot out on the slope --
he caused quite a bit of upset.
That's taken care of now. I’m
planning to reinforce now. Over

COL. TALL (V.0.)
Who was that man who ran out on the
slope? Was that what he was doing?
Admiral Barr saw him through the
glasses; the Admiral couldn't tell
for sure but thought he had gone
out to help someone. Was that it?
The Admiral wants to recommend that
man for something. Over.

STEIN

There were two men who went out,
sir. One was our senior medic. He
was killed. The other -- was one of
the privates. I don't know which
one yet. I'll find out. Over.

(releasing the button)
And fuck you. And the Admiral.

COL. TALL (V.0.)
Fine. Fine, fine. Now, what about
those reinforcements? Over.

STEIN
I have two squads to 1st Platoon, I
can send up... I lost Keck
Colonel. One of my best men...
Over.

COL. TALL (V.0.)
What the hell do you mean, two
squads! When I say reinforcements,
I mean it. Throw every man you have
in there, and do it now. Commit the
reserve platoon and all. Everybody.
1st Platoon too. I see them lying
on their fat asses down there doing
nothing. Move them by the flank in
to the ridge. Get a man to them
right now with orders to attack..

(MORE )

85.
86.

Have the 2@@LP.lditdn( qoretssd the
center. Go straight up the hill!
Envelop them. Do I have to give you
a lesson in infantry tactics while
your men are getting their asses
shot off, Stein? Over.

STEIN

(swallowing his wrath)
I don't think you fully understand
what's going on down here, Colonel.
I don't think my company alone can
take that position. They're too
well dug in. They have too much
firepower. Colonel, there's a
bunker up there, we can't see it
it's chewing my men to pieces. I
formally request, sir, to be given
permission to make a patrol
reconnaissance around to the right
of Hill 210 through the jungle. A
flanking move. It might save lives.
I believe the entire position can
be outflanked by a maneuver there
in force.

COL. TALL (V.0.)
No! I tell you, no! I want a double
envelopment! I order you, Stein, to
attack, attack now, with every man
at your disposal! Now, attack
Stein! That's a direct order! Over

His heart suddenly up in his throat, Stein hears himself
answer with a sort of numb disbelief.

STEIN
Sir, I must tell you that I refuse
to obey your order. I again request
permission to make a patrol
reconnaissance in force around to
the right. The time, sir, is
thirteen twenty-one hours twenty-
five seconds. I have two witnesses
here listening to what I've said. I
request, sir, that you inform
witnesses there. Over.

The fact is that by now there are many more witnesses, at
least half of 2nd Platoon is listening with its ears pricked.

COL. TALL (V.0.)
Stein! Don't pull that guardhouse
lawyer shit with me, Stein!
(MORE)
87.

I know you Cat .a TAdddenmred' dpwyer !
Now shut up and do like I tell you.
I didn't hear what you just said! I
repeat my order! Over!

STEIN
Colonel, I refuse to take my men up
there in a frontal attack It's
suicide! I've lived with these men
two-and-a-half years. I won't order
them all to their deaths. That's
final. Over.

Someone is blubbering now not far away along the crest, and
Stein tries to see who it is and can't. Tall is stupid,
ambitious, desperate to succeed before his superiors and
fearful the battalion will be pulled back off the line before
he can. Otherwise he could never have given such an order
Stein seems to read approval in his men's eyes. Tall's voice
is sharp as a razor.

COL. TALL (V.0.)
This is a very important decision
you're making, Stein. If you feel
that strongly, maybe you have
reason. I'm coming down. I'm not
rescinding my* order to you, but if
I find there are extenuating
circumstances when I get down
there, I'll take that into account.
I want you to hold on until I get
there. If possible, get those men
on the ridge out and moving. I'll
be there in ten minutes. Out!

Stein listens unbelieving, mentally stunned. Moving up, he
arrives at the wounded man, who proves to be Pfc Bead from
Iowa, Fife's assistant clerk. Bead is dying.

BEAD
I'm dying, Captain! I'm dying! Me!
Me! I'm dying! I'm so scared!

He closes his eyes for a moment and swallows. Fife comes up
with the telephone, wide-eyed.

BEAD
I was just laying there. It hit me
right in the side. Like somebody
punched me. Didn't hurt much.
Doesn't hurt much now. Oh, Captain!
88.

STEIN
Just take it easy, son. Just take
it easy.

BEAD
Where's Fife?

STEIN
He's right here, son. Right here.
Fife!

FIFE
I'm here.

BEAD

I'm dying, Fife!

FIFE
I know. Just take it easy. Just
take it easy, Eddie.

BEAD
Will you write my folks?
(as Fife nods)
Tell them it didn't hurt me much.
Tell them the truth.

FIFE
I'll tell them.

BEAD
Hold my hand, Fife. I'm scared.

For a moment, a second, Fife hesitates. Then, realizing with
horror that Bead is slipping away, he grips his hand.
Crawling closer, he slides his other arm under his shoulders
cradling him.

He has begun to cry, more because he suddenly realizes that
he is the only man in the whole company whom Bead can call a
friend, than because Bead is dying. Ah, what a poor friend
he's been!

FIFE
I've got it.

BEAD
Squeeze. Squeeze.

FIFE
I'm squeezing.
89.

He leans forward and presses Bead's hand against his cheek.
Bead gives a little cry.

BEAD
Oh, Fife! Oh, Captain!

His eyes do not go shut but they cease to see. After a moment
Fife puts him down and crawls away by himself, weeping in
terror, weeping in fear, weeping in sadness, hating himself.

STEIN
Lie down somewhere for a little
bit, son. I'll keep the phone for a
few minutes myself. There won't be
any calls coming in for a while.

EXT. CUT TOWARDS LEDGE - DAY

Back at the cut, Becker's men are growing nervous. Where are
the reinforcements? Doll glances nervously at Witt.

BECKER
We're just going to get killed if
we stay here. They're not going to
just let us set. Bell, take six
men, go around to the right of the
ledge, see what's up there. we'll
stay here and cover you best we
can.

Bell sets off with his men. Everything works from the
beginning. Finding the cut totally unguarded, they are able
to crawl into the midst of the Japanese position and drop
grenades down into the rear doors of two covered, camouflaged
emplacements they spot down below them; two further
emplacements, on the uphill side, are more difficult, but
bypassing them and crawling up alongside they are able to
pitch grenades into the apertures.

Father up , Bell discovers the Japanese strongpoint
beautifully dug in and with apertures in three directions. He
does not see it all at first. When the lead man climbs out

he is RIDDLED fatally by three machine guns. Both Witt and
Doll are in Bell's party, but neither of them happens to be
the lead man. This distinction is reserved for a man named
Catch, Lemuel C. Catch, an old-time regular. He dies
immediately and without a sound. They pull his body down and
retreat with it, while all hell breaks loose FIRING just
above their heads, but not before Acting Sergeant Bell gets a
good look at the strongpoint so he can describe it.
90.

BELL
Wait here.

Halting his men a few yards back from where Catch died,
leaving his rifle and holding a grenade in one hand, Bell
climbs up pokes up his head. The Japanese firing has stopped
now. All he can see is the unending grass, rising slowly
along a hillock which sticks up out of the ridge. He waits
wondering if he will die, then pulling the pin, heaves the
grenade with all his strength and ducks down. The grenade
falls and EXPLODES just in front of the hillock, and in the
cyclone of MG FIRE which follows, Bell is able to count five
guns in five spitting apertures which he could not see
before. He notes it all carefully and when the firing ceases
he crawls back down to his men, obscurely satisfied.

BELL
There's five -- five guns.

Whatever it was that made him do it, and he still doesn't
know, it makes every man in his little group look at him
admiringly . Dale, Doll, Witt, especially Witt. Motioning
them on, he leads them back down until the company's main
position at the third swell comes into view. To their
surprise they have not seen or heard a single Japanese
anywhere near the ledge.

WITT
Don't make sense. For them to leave
this place unguarded.

EXT. CUT TOWARDS LEDGE - DAY

The mortar ROUNDS continue to drop at random points along the
swell with strict regularity. It is amazing how few men they
actually wound or kill. Fife hears the soft "SHU-U-U" of the
mortar shell for perhaps half a second. There is not even
time to connect it with himself, before there is a huge
sunburst roaring of an EXPLOSION almost on top of him.

He has a vague impression of someone screaming but does not
know it is himself. Fife's body comes to rest in the lap of a
H.Q's man who happens to be sitting up.

FIFE
Am I hit? Am I hit?

TRAIN
Y-yes, you are. In the head.

FIFE
Bad? Is it bad?
91.

TRAIN
I c-can't tell. Y-you're bleeding
from your head.

FIFE
Am I?

Fife looks at his hands and finds them completely covered
with a glistening red. Gingerly he probes at his skull and
finds nothing.

TRAIN
I-it's in the b-back.
(fearfully)
How do you f-feel?

FIFE
I don't know. It don't hurt. Except
when I touch it.

TRAIN
C-can you w-walk?

FIFE
I-I don't know.

Then, suddenly, Fife realizes that he is free. He does not
have to stay here any more. He is released. He can simply get
up and walk away -- provided he is able -- with honor,
without anyone being able to say he is a coward or court-
martialing him.

FIFE
I think I better go back. Don't
you? Well -- Good luck, Train.

TRAIN
Th-thanks.

Fife stands up. His knees are shaky, but the prospect of
getting out of here gives him a strength he might not
otherwise have. At first slowly, then more swiftly, he begins
to walk rearward. Just before he breasts the top of the hill,
he meets Colonel Tall and a party of his aides.

COL. TALL
Hold on, son. Don't let it get you
down. You'll be back!

Beyond the hill, he passes a barefoot Melanesian in a
lavalava who is leading an American soldier with a bandage
over his eyes back to the rear.
92.

EXT. THIRD FOLD - CP

Stein watches Bell's party through his glasses, astonished.
They did it all on their own!

WELSH
There's less fire coming from the
hill, sir.

STEIN
I've noticed that too.

WELSH
They've knocked out some of those
machine guns. In fact, they've
cleaned out all the Japanese below
the ledge.

LT. BAND
Sir? I think the medics can go out
pick up the wounded now.

STEIN
Send ist Platoon forward. We'll
follow them.

Stein is just turning to lead the CP up toward the ledge, to
join Becker and Bell and to consolidate their newly won
position, when he looks up to see Col. Tall walking leisurely
toward him, carrying beneath his arm the unadorned little
bamboo baton that is his trademark and romantic whim.

Bell's raid has cleaned out the Japanese below the ledge and
established a real line. It has utterly changed the
situation, and it is one of those horrible ironies which seem
to dog the steps of certain men named Stein-that just at this
moment Col. Tall should walk onto the field.

COL. TALL
What are you doing lying down there
where you can't see anything?

STEIN
Observing, sir. I just sent 1st
Platoon forward to the ridge.

Tall nods. The rest of his party, which includes a young
captain named GAFF, his battalion exec, has decided that it
might be just as well to be lying flat on the ground.
A mortar
anybody,
to where

haunches.

93.

COL. TALL
I saw them leaving as we were
coming along. How many of them were
hit this time?

STEIN
None, sir.

COL. TALL
None? Not one?

round mushrooms, EXPLODING dirt without hurting
somewhere along the rear, and Tall, coming forward
Stein lies, permits himself to squat on his

COL. TALL
That doesn't sound much like the
situation you described to me over
the soundpower.

STEIN
It's not, sir. The situation's
changed. In just the last five

minutes.

COL. TALL
To what do you attribute the
change?

STEIN

Sergeant Becker, sir. When I last
looked, half of his men had
disappeared. I think he sent them
off to try and knock out some of
the MGs. They seem to have
succeeded.

From somewhere far off a machine gun begins to RATTLE and a
long line of bullets strikes up dirt twenty-five yards beyond
them. Tall does not change his position or alter his voice.

COL. TALL
Then you got my message to him.

STEIN
No, sir. Becker sent the men off on
his own. They went off on their
own.

COL. TALL
I see.
94.

The long line of MG BULLETS comes sweeping back from Stein's
left, this time only fifteen yards away. Tall does not move
but merely squints his blue eyes off at the grassy ridge in
silence.

STEIN
They've seen you, sir.

COL. TALL
Stein, we're going over there, all
of us, and we're taking everybody
with us. Do you have any more
formal complaints or demurrers?

STEIN
No, sir. Not now.

COL. TALL
Now we'll do things my way. We'll
take everybody over to the ledge.
We may take that ridge before
nightfall.

STEIN
I think that ridge is quite a way
from being reduced, sir.

Tall ignores this remark and stands up to his full height.
The conference is over. Tall gives the ridge one contemptuous
amused look and starts walking out toward it, still talking
to Stein. Slowly, very slowly, Stein stands up to his full
height also, then follows Tall out into the field where ten
minutes before they would have met a certain death.

Around them, as if sensing something or other is in the wind,
the men begin to stir. Whatever else Stein can find to say
about him, he nevertheless has to admit that with Tall's
arrival on the battlefield a change for the better has come
over everything and everybody. Tall has brought with him some
quality that has not been here before, and it shows in the
faces of the men. Standing up in front of the prone H.Q.
Platoon, his little baton in his right hand, tapping it
lightly against his shoulder as he frowns in concentration
he orders them forward and shows them how he wants them to
advance. He does not exhort them. His attitude says quite
plainly that they deserve better than that. Gathering heart,
the men rush forward in groups.
95.

EXT. CUT

Becker and Bell, Witt, Dale and Doll wait at the ledge. As
the others scramble up to join them, there are a few weak
cheers.

COL. TALL
That strongpoint is the key to the
ridge. Se -- uh -- Sergeant Bell
here is quite right. From their
knob there our little brown
brothers can cover the whole of the
ground in front of our position for
a thousand yards. Why they've left
it unguarded I have no idea. We
must exploit it before they see
their error. I know everyone's
pretty exhausted and that we've had
our troubles getting water up here,
but if we can reduce that big
bunker, I see no reason why we
can't take the whole ridge before
nightfall. I'm asking for
volunteers to go back up there and
knock it out.

Stein, hearing for the first time this news about a further
attack, is so horrified he can hardly believe his ears.
Surely Tall must know how worn out they all are.

BELL
Sir, I'll be glad to go back again
and lead the way for a party.

Immediately off to Bell's right another voice pipes up. Hunch-
shouldered, crack-faced Acting Sergeant Dale is making his

bid for future fame, future sinecures, future security from
army kitchens.

DALE
I'll go, Colonel, sir! what about
you, Doll?

Doll nods his agreement, without looking at Dale, and Private
Witt comes forward at the same time. Both sit down, much
closer to Bell than to Dale, who still squats by himself.
Bell winks at Witt, who grins and winks back.

The rather elderly, Calvinistic-looking 2nd lieutenant from
3rd Platoon presents himself. His name is GORE. Then Tall's
own exec, young Captain Gaff, puts in his two cents and
offers his services.
96.

GAFF
I'd like to lead the party,
Colonel.

COL. TALL

(gazing at him fondly)
All right, John. Go ahead. You'll
be in command. That's enough. Seven
is plenty. In the terrain you'll be
working, more men would only hinder
you, I think. I know more of you
would like to go. You'll have to
wait for another opportunity.

Stein, hearing this, peers at his commander closely and is
amazed to see that Tall is in deadly earnest and not joking
at all.

COL. TALL
Good man, my young exec... You'll
probably find the bunker guarded by
smaller MG posts around it. I think
it is better to ignore these and go
for the strongpoint itself if you
possibly can. The little posts will
fall if the big one is taken.
That's all, gentlemen. Noncoms
return to your positions. I want
the officers to remain. Synchronize
watches with me, John.

A mortar round EXPLODES nearby. At first it appears no one is
hurt, but then Storm is seen shaking his hand as though he'd
touched a hot stove. A single fragment, not much bigger than
a pinhead, has entered the back of his hand. Storm grins.

STORM
I been wounded! I been wounded!

WELSH
(with a sneer)
Okay. You'll get a Purple Heart.

STORM
You fucking A! And don't you forget
to put me in. S’like a wasp sting.
Captain, when can I go to the rear?
I mean, you know, I been wounded.

He raises his hand. When he flexes it, it makes a GRATING
sound. Nobody says anything. Storm continues to look
delighted.
97.

STEIN
You want to go right now?

STORM
Sure.

He looks at his hand again, to see whether it has changed.
There is no blood coming from the little blue-rimmed hole and
really it doesn't hurt very much, but every time he flexes it
they can all hear it grate. Stein nods. Storm may leave.

STORM
Might be a delicate operation to
get that fucking thing out of
there.

EXT. LEDGE - DAY

Meanwhile, Capt. Gaff's little assault party crawls off to
the right along the ledge and disappears around the corner of
the hillside. Bell, at the head of the seven men, keeps
thinking that he had only volunteered to lead a party back.
Irritably, he glances back to motion the others to come on.
When he reaches the point where he crawled out above the
ledge he stops. Sending Witt ahead, he points the place out
to Gaff.

Witt crawls out to take the point. Standing on his knees out
away from the ledge, he holds his rifle ready with the safety
off. He hasn't shot squirrel all his life for nothing; he
hasn't made High Expert on the range for the past six years
for nothing, either.

GAFF

Any of you guys know how to operate
this thing?

(the walkie-talkie; Bell

nods)
Okay, you stay below the ledge,
I'll call down the data to you from
up above. Once the 81s have
plastered that rock as much as they
can, we'll crawl out along that low
place until we make a line, then
crawl up as close as we can through
the grass, then throw our grenades.
Okay? Okay.

Gaff crawls out into the low place before the first shells
arrive. They can hear their soft SHU-SHU-SHU coming almost
straight down before they hit, then the hillside EXPLODES
into smoke and flame and noise.
98.

Only fifty yards from the bunker, they are showered with a
rain of dirt, chips of rock and small pieces of hot metal.
They cling to the ledge with their faces pressed against the
sharp rock, cursing with hatred the goddamned fucking
mortarmen because they might drop a short round, though they
don't. Gaff yells down changes of range and Bell relays them
by walkie-talkie.

GAFF
Okay! Tell them to stop! I think
that's enough. Whatever damage they
can do, they've done it by now.

Suddenly the mortars stop falling, in a silence that is
almost as devastating as the noise has been.

GAFF
Okay, let's go!

If they are under any hopeful illusion that the mortar
barrage has smashed and flattened every Japanese in the
strongpoint, they are straightened out on this point right
away. As the elderly, morose 2nd lieutenant Gore climbs out
first, he foolishly stands straight up, exposing himself to
the waist, whereupon a Japanese machine gunner immediately
SHOOTS him three times trough the chest. Gingerly, they pull
him back down behind the ledge.

DALE
Whadda we do now? We can't take him
with us.

WITT

We'll have to leave him.

THORNE
You can't leave him here.

DALE
Okay. He's from your platoon. You
stay with him.

THORNE
I didn't volunteer for this thing
just to sit with him.

LT. GORE
(in a faint voice)
I should have been a chaplain. I
could have, you know. I'm an
ordained minister. I never should
have fooled around with the
Infantry. My wife told me.
99.

BELL
We can leave him and pick him up on
the way back. If he's still alive.

LT. GORE
You boys want to pray with me?

DALE
We can't, sir. We got to get going.
The Captain's waitin’ on us.

LT. GORE
(without opening his eyes)
All right. I'll do it myself. You
boys go ahead.

Witt does what he can to make Gore comfortable. As they climb
out one by one on their faces and bellies so as not to make
the same mistake Gore made, the faint voice drones on. Dale
goes first, then Doll, with Witt immediately behind him.

DOLL
I wish he had of been a chaplain.
They've seen us now. They know
we're here.

Bell is the last to go, but he stops at the ledge, feeling he
ought to say something, some word of encouragement.

BELL
Well, good luck, sir.

LT. GORE
Thanks, son. Which one are you? I
don't want to open my eyes if I can
help it.

BELL
I'm Bell, sir.

LT. GORE
Oh, yes. Well, if you get the
chance, maybe you can say some
little prayer for me. I don't want
to embarrass you. It certainly
can't do no harm, can it?

BELL
Okay, sir. Goodbye.

As he climbs out, pressing his face and chest as hard into
the dirt as he can, the faint voice goes droning feebly on.
100.

GAFF
Is he dead?

DALE
Not yet.

GAFF

Okay, we'll crawl up through the
grass towards the bunker. Don't
fire or throw your grenades until I
give the signal. I want to get as
close to the bunker as we can
without them seeing us.

They are now strung out single file one behind the other.
Bell sees there is another way they could approach the
bunker, one that leads up above and behind the bunker.

BELL
Sir, see up there? After that
little open space we'd be behind
that little rise, and then I think
we could maybe crawl all the way
around behind them.

GAFF

Yes, right, good. But I don't think
there's that much time. What do you
say, Dale?

(Dale nods)
That would take at least another
hour of crawling. It's too near
dark. What do you think?

DALE
I agree with you, sir.

No fuckin’ officer is goin’ to get Charlie Dale to take no
responsibility for what the officer done.

GAFF
Okay. Let's do it.

Slowly Gaff snakes his belly over the lip of the trough and
off into the grass, dragging his rifle by the muzzle rather
than cradling it, so as not to disturb the grass more than
absolutely necessary. One by one, the others follow. None of
them knows what sets the Japanese off. One moment they are
crawling along in utter silence, each man totally alone and
separate and out of contact with the others, and in the next
machine gun FIRE is whipping and slashing over and around and
all about them. Whatever it was, they now lie separated from
each other, unable to take concerted action.
101.

Each man puts his head down and huddles to the ground,
praying that he might keep on living. Contact is lost and
with it all command and control.

DALE
We're pinned down!

It is in this static situation of potential total loss that
Pfc Don Doll comes forward as a hero. Sweating, lying pressed
flat in an ecstasy of panic, terror, fear and cowardice, he
simply cannot stand it any longer. Wailing over and over ina
high falsetto one word -- "Mother! Mother!" -- which
fortunately nobody can hear, least of all himself, he leaps
to his feet and begins to run straight at the Japanese
emplacement, FIRING his rifle from his hip at the one
embrasure he can see. As if startled beyond reasonable
expectation, most of the Japanese fire stops suddenly. At the
same moment, Capt. Gaff, released from his own temporary
panic, leaps up waving his arm and shouts for the rest to
fall back. With Gaff in the lead the rest of the assault
force runs for the trough and their lives. Meanwhile Doll
charges on, wailing his incantation: "Mother! Mother!"

When his rifle is empty, he throws it at the embrasure, draws
his pistol and begins FIRING it. With his left hand he tears
a grenade from his belt, stops firing the pistol long enough
to pull the pin with one finger, and lobs the grenade over
into the camouflaged roof of the emplacement, which he can
now see clearly since it is only about twenty yards away, and
where the grenade EXPLODES uselessly and without effect.
Then, continuing to FIRE the pistol, he charges on. Only when
the pistol ceases to fire for want of ammunition does he come
to his senses and realize where he is.

Astonished, he turns and runs. Luckily for Doll, he does not
turn back toward the others but simply runs blindly off to
the right. In this direction the curving ledge is only ten
yards away, and he reaches it before the mass of the.
Japanese FIRE can find him.

From behind him as he runs the ten yards a dark, round,
FIZZLING object arches over his head and falls a few feet in
front of him. Automatically Doll kicks at it with his foot as
if place-kicking a football, and runs on. It bounces away a
few yards and EXPLODES in a cloud of black smoke which knocks
him down. But when he falls he finds that there is nothing-
under him; he has fallen over the ledge. His foot stinging
painfully, he bounces to the foot of the ledge, landing with
a bone-jarring THUD, then rolls another ten yards before he
can get himself stopped.
102.

EXT. LEDGE - DAY

For a while Doll just lies in the grass, breathing in groans
bruised, sore, the wind knocked out of him, half-blinded. At
the moment all he can think about is that he wants to be with
people, so he can put his arms around somebody and they can
put their arms around him. With this in mind, he gets up and,
grasping the ledge, runs gas pin back along it till he comes
to the trough, where he almost runs head-on into the others,
all sitting against the rock and gasping breathlessly. Only
one of them, Thorne, has been hurt, and he has had his
shoulder smashed by an MG bullet. Capt. Gaff speaks before
Doll can apologize, make excuses or explain away what he has
done. Doll can hardly believe his ears.

GAFF
Doll, I'm personally recommending
you to Colonel Tall for the
Distinguished Service Cross. You
saved all our lives. I never saw
such bravery. I'm going to write
the recommendation myself, and I'm
going to pursue it. I promise you.

DOLL
Well, sir, it wasn't nothin’. I was
scared.

He can see Charlie Dale looking at him with a kind of hate-
filled envy from where he leans gasping against the ledge.

GAFF
To remember the ledge was off there
to the right, that was wonderful.

DOLL
Well, sir, you know, I was with the
first patrol.

He smiles insolently at Dale. Gaff is still breathing
heavily.

GAFF
So were some of these others. Are
you okay? You're not hurt?

DOLL
(fingering his boot)
Well, sir, I don't know.

GAFF
What's that from?
103.

DOLL
A Jap hand grenade. I kicked it
away. I better look.

He unlaces the boot. Inside he finds the little piece of
metal which has slipped to the bottom like a pebble, but in
actual truth, he has not even felt it. He lies, laughing.

DOLL
Hunh! Felt like a rock in my shoe.

GAFF
By God! It's only a scratch, but by
God I'm recommending you for the
Purple Heart, too. You might as
well have it. You're all right --
except for that?

DOLL
I lost my rifle.

GAFF
Take Lieutenant Gore's. We better
be getting back. And tell them we
couldn't take the objective. Cana
couple of you drag Lieutenant Gore?
(to Thorne)
You all right? Think you can make

it?

THORNE
I'm all right. But I want to thank
you!

DOLL

Don't thank me.

THORNE
I'm out of it now. I'll be going
back. I hope I'm crippled a little.

GAFF
Come on, you guys. Let's move. You
can talk it over later. Dale, you
and Witt drag Lieutenant Gore.
Bell, you help the Thorne. I'll
take the walkie-talkie. Doll, you
rear-guard us. Them little brown
brothers, as the Colonel likes to
say, are liable to send some people
down here after us, you know.
104.

EXT. PATH DOWN LEDGE - DAY

The little party makes its way back. The Japanese send no one
after them. Gaff stops at the point where Bell found the
little path that might lead up above the Japanese position.

GAFF
I think we can take it! If we get
another chance at it tomorrow, I
think we can take it. I, for one,
am going to volunteer for the
assignment. If we crawl on across
that open space and get behind the
rise, up that path Bell found --
see there? -- we can come around
behind them -- come down on them
from above. Sergeant Bell was
right. From up there we can put the
grenades to them -- easier than
hell.

WITT
I'll go with you, Captain.

Doll says he will too, and so does Dale. Strangely enough,
there is not one of them but who wants to go back with him --
excepting, of course, Thorne who cannot go.

EXT. CUT - BATTALION POSITION - DAY

The soldiers at C-for-Charlie's forward position watch and
wait anxiously to see who will return with the assault party,
if anyone returns at all. Queen chews his fingernails; the
tension is unbearable. Suddenly, they hear the electrifying
word: "Witt!" Other names follow: "Doll... Dale... Bell."

Stein watches the weary men crawl, licking their wounds, back
into the midst of the company. It is getting close to dark.
They find that, in their absence, most of Charlie has, on
Colonel Tall's orders, already dug in. The company looks at
them with reverence, though it has heard and correctly
interpreted their little assault as a failure. As Witt passes
by, Welsh smiles at him sardonically.

WITT
You know what I'm afraid of, Firs’
Sarn’? That someday I'll end up
like you. I hope I die before it
happens.
105.

WELSH
I feel sorry for you, kid. A
little.

WITT

How's that?

WELSH
The Army's going to kill you.

(taking Witt's measure)

Take care of yourself. Forget the
others. There's nothing you can do
for them. You're running into a
burning house, where nobody can be
saved. Why save people that aren't
worth saving anyway?

(when Witt does not reply)
There's no other world. Just this
one. Your sacrifice won't mean
anything. Nobody's does.

(pointing up the hill)

Who decides, when you walk out on
that slope, who gets hit, who
doesn't? What difference can a
single man make in all this --
madness -- this evil?

Witt does not answer but looks at him, turns and goes away.

Lt. Band queries Dale about his experiences. Apart froma
natural curiosity, he feels Dale has been a loner in the
outfit and could benefit from some expression of friendly
interest from an officer.

LT. BAND
Well, Dale, what was it like up
there?
(as bale shrugs)
Didn't you feel anything up there?

DALE
Feel? Yeah, I guess I felt scared.
Once we was there, anyway.

LT. BAND
Well, you hardly look it, Sergeant.

DALE
You don't really know me yet,
Lootenant.
106.

LT. BAND
But when those men were hit! One
died! You knew them!

DALE
Lootenant, I think we done pretty
good. Got off pretty lucky. As for
feeling, the Service don't pay me
no extra "Feeling Pay" for feeling.
Like they pay flyers "Flight Pay"
for flyin’. I figure I ain't
required to feel. I don't plan to
feel any more than's absolutely
necessary. The minimum feeling.

EXT. BATTALION AID STATION - DAY

Fife walks up to the battalion aid station, his heart dancing
with the wild, joyful knowledge that he is wounded and can
leave. Then, seeing the more seriously wounded, he suddenly
begins to weep, he cannot stop himself.

He sits with a line of grimy, bleeding, groaning men on a
hillside, mopping the blood from his forehead. There seem to
be hundreds of people running everywhere, all shouting at one
another. An orderly attaches a colored tag to Fife's jacket

A DOCTOR leans over and looks into Fife's eyes and then snaps
his fingers in front of them.

FIRST DOCTOR
Can't tell. Don't walk. Wait for
the stretcher-bearers to take you.
Hear me? Don't walk. Answer me. I
said don't walk.

Fife is carted away by four beat-looking STRETCHER-BEARERS.

FI FE
Listen, fellows, I can make it all
right. You guys should be carrying
somebody hit worse than me.

STRETCHER-BEARER
You just take it easy, mack. You
been doin' the fightin'. Let us
worry about the carryin'.

Good boys, good boys. He relaxes cozily. He will never have
to go back there, and it hasn't really been bad at all. For a
second, he catches Sico’s eye, but with a fine discretion, he
looks away.
107.

INT. OPERATING TENT - DAY

But in the operating tent, Fife finds out it isn't going to
be at all as easy as he thought. He is put on a vacant table,
in front of old DOC HAINES, the Head Regimental Surgeon.
Grizzled, Doc Haines works with an unlit stub of a cigar in
his mouth, grunting to himself from time to time.

DOC HAINES
Wait. Don't tell me. It's -- Fife,
isn't it? C-for-Charlie Company.

FIFE
Yes, sir, Doc.

Doc HAINES
I remember you from when you went
up to Post Hospital for that
appendectomy. How did that ever
turn out? Everything all right now?
What have we here now? Head wound,
hunh? Can you sit up?

FIFE
Sure! Sure!

Doc HAINES
Easy. Take it easy. You've lost a
little blood there. Let's have a
look-see. This’ll hurt a little bit
now... You're lucky. It isn't
fractured. You may have, I think
what we call a greenstick fracture,
sort of crack, not a break. In any
case, there's no foreign objects
inside. In a week or so, you'll be
all ready to go again.

FIFE
Then -- you don't think I'll be
evacuated. Or anything like that.

Doc HAINES
I wouldn't think so.

FIFE
Then I can walk all right now.

Doc HAINES
Do anything you like. Except you
should take it easy for a day or
two.
108.

FIFE
(bitterly)
Thanks, Doc.

DOC HAINES
This battle'll be over in a day or
two, you know.

FIFE
Sure. As soon as this one’s over,
there'll be another one. Right
after.

From his blood-caked face he grins, feeling it draw his
cheeks. He knows he makes a good picture of a wounded man
anyway.

DOC HAINES
I didn't make the rules, son. I
just try to live by them.

FIFE
It's not your problem. If a guy
ain't hurt bad enough to ship out,
you can't ship him out, can you? I
better go.

Doc HAINES
Good luck, son.

Fife waves his hand without looking back.

EXT. OPERATING TENT - DAY

Outside the operating tent the CAPTAIN who is the Regimental
S-1 sees Fife and breaks away from a group of other staff
officers.

S-1
Hey! Aren't you from Charlie
Company?
FIFE
Yes, sir. Yes, sir! I sure am!
S-1
How's it going up there?
FIFE
Terrible!
(maliciously)

(MORE )
109.
They're knédltf(garie' éhit out of

us!

S-1
How's Lt. Whyte making out?

FIFE
Dead!

The S-1 Captain recoils a little, as if he has been struck
his eyes disturbed. The others in the group of gossiping
officers have turned and are listening too.

S-1
How about Lt. Blane?

FIFE
Dead! Keck's dead! Grove's dead!
Tella, Bead, Catt!

S-1
Well, what about Captain Stein?
We're good friends.

FIFE
He was all right when I left! He's
prob'ly dead too by now!

He goes off. Then suddenly, for no reason, he begins to
blubber again. Falling down on his knees behind a truck, he
beats his fists in the mud, beside himself.

At the ledge the high racketing which has hung in the air
most of the day ceased some time ago, and only sporadic RIFLE
FIRE can be heard now in the distance. As twilight passes
into night, the officers discuss the prospects of tomorrow
and the men clean their weapons.

Beneath a canopy of hard, bright stars, the men struggle to
get a few hours' sleep. Sgt. Welsh walks silently, quietly
through their midst. The Japanese dead lie in the moonlight,
their pockets turned inside out. They are at peace, while the
living burn and rage.

INT. HOSPITAL TENT - NIGHT
Later, in a corner of the large, three-masted, circus-type
hospital tent, he finds Storm, sitting on a cot and staring

glumly at the blue-edged hole in the back of his hand.

FIFE
Storm!
110.

STORM
How you doin', kid? You're the
first guy I seen from the outfit.

Storm is glad to see Fife, too. Right now any familiar face
is welcome in this buzzing, crowded, haunted place.

INT. HOSPITAL TENT - NIGHT
Storm spits on the ground. Some time has passed.

STORM

The adventure of war, the
brotherhood, the comradeship, you
know -- they can wipe their ass on
it. It might be all right for field
officers and up, who get to run it
and decide what to do. Everybody
else is a tool -- with their serial
number stamped on ‘em. I don't like
being no tool. Not, especially,
when it can get you killed.

(after a pause)
They used to fight man to man. It
was a duel. You could be brave and
noble, all that shit. What you were
-- your personal qualities -- they
counted. Now it's just like two
machines grinding each other up. I
feel sorry about leaving the
comp’ny and coming down here. But
shit...

(after a pause)
If this hand don't get me clean
away from this fucking Rock, I can
go back to being a mess sergeant. I
can cook hot food for ‘em and get
it to 'em. I won't carry it myself.
The carriers can do that. Lot of
people are going to come out of
this war alive, more than get
killed -- I want to be one of them.

(guiltily)
I hadn't told nobody else. I want
to leave a good impression on the
boys. Morale, you know.

Fife's sharp despair leaves him for a moment. He suddenly
feels toward Storm as toward a father or older brother.
111.

STORM
Here I am trying to use my hand to
get me out of the comp'ny. But the
fact is, everybody's on their own.
Solo.

FIFE
What do you think they're going to
say about it?

Storm stares at him with dark, haunted eyes.

STORM
Since you ain't a doctor, I guess I
can tell you the truth.
(flexing his hand)
I got a hunch it ain't ever gonna
get me off this Rock.

Around them in the big, dim tent, orderlies stir and move
quietly about. Here and there, men groan from within their
bandages.

STORM
I can move it. It don't really hurt
too bad. But I ain't got any
strength left in it.
(after a pause)
You was looking pretty bad up
there.

FIFE
(bitterly)
Nothing! Nothing! Not a fucking
thing. Not even a fracture.

STORM
It's just tough luck. I'll tell you
one thing, Fife. Whether I get...
(raising his hand)
off The Rock with it or not, I
don't have to go back up there to
the front with the comp'ny, and I'm
not going to. I'm a mess sergeant
I ain't even supposed to be up
there. Me and my cooks'1ll get the
kitchen as close as we can, I'll
get them guys up hot meals every
time I can. But fuck the
volunteering shit. They got them
hot meals coming to them -- if they
can get them. But that's all. No
more volunteer fightin’
(MORE)
Fife nods.

112.

I ain't re@7DRM cant TW hin't
supposed to, and I ain't gonna.

FIFE
I'm the Forward Echelon clerk. I
got to go.

STORM
I'm sorry.

They are silent for a moment.

FIFE
I'm a coward.

STORM
(immediately)
So am I. So is everybody who ain't
a fucking goddamn fool.

FIFE
Some of the guys ain't. Witt, Doll,
Bell. Even Charlie Dale.

STORM
(without hesitation)
Then they're fools.

Nearby a sleeping man screams in his sleep, then falls silent

again.

FIFE
I mean really a coward.

STORM
What did you think I meant?

FIFE
With you it's different.

STORM
No it ain't.

FIFE
I didn't want to be a coward. I
never thought I would be. Just
turns out I am... I been hiding it.

STORM
Well, I didn't want to be one
either, I guess. But I am.
(flexing his hand)
Thank God I don't have to go back
up there, that's all.
113.

FIFE
I do.

STORM
I'm sorry. At least you'll have a
couple of days off. This shootin'1ll
be over with by then.

It is clear that Storm is sorry. But his tone points out
that, even while he is sorry, all that really has nothing to
do with him. Still, Fife feels better. Storm takes being a
coward so much more in his stride, and it makes Fife feel
less unmanly.

FIFE
All these men around here lookin’
at me like I was a hero. I haven't
even done my normal duty...

STORM
I don't believe there's many
heroes. Ones I seen was crazy. Or
got killed. The brave ones always
die.

FIFE
Maybe I could come to work for you
in the kitchen. I mean, since Dale
will be making line sergeant
you'll have a vacancy, won't you?

STORM
Yeah, I guess. Can you cook?

FIFE
No, but I can learn.

STORM
If you can get the Captain to move
you to the kitchen force, I'll
accept you.

FIFE
Stein'll never let me go. Anyway, I
could never ask him.

STORM
It's the best I can do.

FIFE
Yeah. I know, I know.
114.

He twists his neck from side to side and peers around the
high, dim, hot-aired tent. A single orderly moves down the
line of wounded men, sleeping now, each in a cocoon of
mosquito netting.

FIFE
I don't want to let them down. They
never let me down. I'd feel like I
was hiding.

He walks off. He might as well get it over with. If he waits
until morning, he might find reasons not to.

EXT. HOSPITAL TENT - NIGHT

At the door to the tent, an ORDERLY rises to block Fife's
path, but Fife pushes on past him.

ORDERLY
Where are you going? You don't have
your discharge papers. Stay there.
You can't do this!

Storm, following Fife out, steals a couple of rifles anda
helmet from an unattended MP jeep.

EXT. CUT - DAWN

Whispers and cautionary stirrings move along the line. In the
inhuman, unreal unlight of false dawn, the dirty-faced
remnants of C-for-Charlie sift from their holes and gather
stiffly into their squads and platoons. Still looking dapper,
although he is now almost as dirty as themselves, Col. Tall,
with his little bamboo baton in his armpit and his hand
resting on his rakishly low-slung holster, strides among the
men wishing them good luck. When he arrives at Gaff's group,
he squats down.

COL. TALL
I'm giving you another chance at
the bunker today, gentlemen. I
would have liked to make a night
attack, I think we could have
brought it off -- But the division
commander vetoed the idea. At least
I made the offer. I still believe a
small party has a better chance
than a large one, but with your two
casualties you might need another
couple of volunteers.

(MORE)
115.

(turnif@Lto Tédttf(cont 'd)
I leave you that decision.

Queen comes up to Tall a few minutes later.

QUEEN
Colonel, I'd like to go with ‘em.
COL. TALL
Why?
QUEEN

Because of what the Japs done to
them two guys from 2nd Battalion
three days ago. I ain't forgotten
it, either, and I want to get
myself a few of them personally
before I get knocked off or shot
up. I figure Cap'n Gaff's
operation'1ll be my best
opportunity.

For a moment, Tall cannot help believing he is being made the
victim of some kind of elaborate and tasteless hoax. 1st Sgt.
Welsh, for one, has a mind capable of such subtle ridicule.

COL. TALL
Soldier, are you serious? There's a
war on here. I'm busy. I've got a
battle to fight.

QUEEN
Yes. I mean: Yes, sir: I'm serious.

COL. TALL
Sergeant, I'm a professional
soldier. Requests for personal
vendetta offend and bore me. If you
want to go with Captain Gaff,
you'll have to go talk to him about
it and ask him. I'm busy. You can
tell him that I don't object to
your going. Now, goddamn it, go_
away !

QUEEN
Yes, sir! Thank you, sir!

Shortly afterwards, Gaff approaches his little assault party -
- Bell and Witt, Dale and Doll.

GAFF
Sgt. Queen's coming with us.
116.

The four volunteers are treated to the awesome spectacle of
Big Queen looming over them in the dawn, still clutching his
shotgun and bandolier of shells which he clung to so dearly
all through the terror of yesterday in his U.S.-made shell
hole.

DALE
If they don't get us some water up
here soon, we ain't none of us
going to make it to the top of this
hill.

He says it loud enough to be heard by everybody in the
vicinity. He rolls over to face the looming shape of Hill 209
in their rear and begins to shake his fist at it.

DALE
Monkeyfuckers! Dirty bastards!
Fucking pigs! You got all the
fucking water in the world, and you
drinking ever fucking drop of it
too. You ain't lettin’ any of it et
past you up to us, are you! well,
you better get some of it up here
to your goddamn fightin’ men, or
you can take your goddamn fucking
battle and shove it up your ass!

His protest REVERBERATES along the ledge, but nobody pays any
attention to it. The rest of it tapers away into a mutter, as
Col. Tall now saunters over to Gaff, baton in hand.

COL. TALL
John, we'll be back of you. If you
can break through, we'll come
pouring after. We'll charge at your
whistle signal.

Then they are off and crawling along the ledge, which curves
away out of sight around the side of the hill, Gaff in the
lead.

BELL
Better let me take the point, sir.

Gaff turns back to look at him, the ex-officer, then with an
abrupt gesture of both head and hand, admits his small error
and signals Bell to go on past him.
117.

EXT. LEDGE WHERE TROUGH BEGINS - DAY

When Bell reaches the point where the trough begins and Lt.
Gore died, he stops and they all cluster up. Gaff does not
bother to give them any pep talk.

GAFF
You all know the job we've clot to
do, fellows. There's no point in my
going over it again. I'm convinced
the toughest part will be the open
space between the end of the trough
here and the shoulder of the knob.
Once we get past that, it won't be
so bad. Remember that we may run
into smaller emplacements along the
way. I'd rather by-pass them if we
can, but we may have to knock them
out. Okay, that's all. When we get
up to them, we ought to have some
fun.

He stops and smiles at them, looking each man in the eyes in
turn: a happy, adventuresome smile. There are several weak
smiles in reply, similar to his own if not as strong. Only
Witt's and Queen's seem to be really deep. But they are all
grateful to him. Since yesterday, all of them have come to
like him very much. He treats them like equals. They would
follow him anywhere.

GAFF
Once we get through this mess and
back down off the line, I promise
you the biggest drunk of your
lives. My treat! I'll be leading
from here on out. I want to pick
the route myself. If anything
should happen to me, Sergeant Bell
will be in command, so I want him
last. Sergeant Dale will be second
in command. They both know what to
do. Let's go.

EXT. TROUGH TO KNOB - DAY

Suddenly, they are out and crawling along the narrow,
familiar trough. Gaff in the lead, each man careful of the
spot where the trough opens out into the ledge and Lt. Gore
got himself killed.
118.

Gaff looks off toward the strongpoint, but without raising
his head high enough to see anything above the grass. Are
they waiting? Are they watching? Are they looking at this
particularly open spot? He cannot know.

With a sudden gasp, he bounces up and takes off with his
rifle at high port, running agonizingly slowly and pulling
his knees up high to clear the matted kunai grass like a
football player running through stacks of old tires. Not a
shot is fired. He dives in behind the shoulder of the knob
and lies there. After waiting a full minute, he motions the
next man, Queen, to come on. Queen takes off running in the
same way, the shotgun in his hands, his helmet straps
flagging. Just before he reaches the shoulder, a single
machine gun OPENS UP, but he dives to safety. The machine gun
STOPS.

The third man, Doll, falls. He is only about five yards out
when several MGs OPEN UP. They are watching this time. It is
only twenty yards across, the open space, but it seems much
longer. He is already breathing in ripping gasps. Then his
foot catches in a hole in the mat of old grass and he is
down. Oh, no! his mind screams at him in panic. Not me! Not
after all the rest that's happened to me! Blindly, spitting
grass seeds and dust, he clambers up and staggers on. He has
ten yards more to go, and he makes it.

But now all the MGs from the strongpoint are FIRING, hosing
down the trough itself, as well as the open space. BULLETS
tear over the heads of Dale, Witt and Bell in bunches which
RATTLE and bruise the thin bushes. It is now Dale's turn to
go, and he is furious.

BELL
Hey, wait! Wait! Don't go yet! I
got an idea!

Dale gives him one hate-filled contemptuous look and gets to
his feet. He departs without a word, chugging along solidly
like a little engine. He arrives behind the shoulder and sits
down, apparently totally unmoved, but still bristling with
anger. Nothing has touched him.

GAFF
You must be out of your mind!

Maliciously, Dale settles in to see what Bell and Witt will
do now. Heh heh. Not that he wants them to get hurt or
anything.

Bell demonstrates his idea immediately. When he and Witt have
crawled to the end of the trough, the MGs still FIRING just

over their heads, Bell pulls the pin on a grenade and lobs it
at the strongpoint. But he does not throw it straight across;
119.

he throws it into the angle formed by the ledge and the
trough, so that it lands in front of the bunker but away
toward the ledge. when the MGs all swing that way, as they do
immediately, he and Witt cross in safety before they can
swing back.

Clearly, the three of them could have done it just as easily,
and when he throws himself down grinning in the safety behind
the shoulder, Bell winks at Charlie Dale again. Dale glowers

back.

EXT. KNOB AND SADDLE - DAY

Gaff said the rest of the route would be easier once they
were past the open space, and he is right. The terrain mounts
steeply around the knob which juts out of the ridge and up
here the mat of grass is not quite so thick, but now they are
forced to crawl. It is next to impossible to see the
camouflaged emplacements until they open up, and they cannot
take any chances. They all know from yesterday that beyond
the knob is a shallow saddle between the knob and the rock
wall where the ledge ends, and it is along this saddle which
they are to crawl to come down on the Japanese from above.

When they reach the beginning of the saddle, sweating and
half-dead from lack of water, Gaff motions them to stop. He
has to swallow his dry spittle several times before he can
speak. Remembering that the other platoons will charge at the
sound of his whistle, he unhooks it from his pocket.

GAFF
I want to get as close to them as
we can before we put the grenades
to them. Well, fellows, this is
where we separate the sheep from
the goats. Let's crawl.

He clamps his whistle in his teeth and, cradling his rifle
while holding a grenade in one hand, he commences to do so.

EXT. JAPANESE STRONGPOINT (THE ATTACK) - DAY

Slowly, as they crawl, the entire strongpoint becomes visible
-- its nearer, right end only twenty-five yards away, and
only a very few yards below their own height. And it is just
as they can finally see it, that they are discovered by the
Japanese.

Five scrawny, bedraggled Japanese men pop up out of the
ground holding dark round objects which they lob up the hill
at them. Fortunately, only one of the five grenades EXPLODES.
120.

It lights near Dale, who rolls over twice away from it and
then lies huddled as close to the ground as he can get, his
face turned away. None of its fragments hit him, but it makes
his ears ring.

GAFF
Pull and throw! Pull and throw!

Almost as one man, their six grenades arch at the
strongpoint. The five Japanese men who popped up out of the
ground have by now popped back down into it. But, as the
grenades light, two other, unlucky Japanese pop up to throw.
One grenade lights between the feet of one of these and
EXPLODES up into him, blowing off one of his feet and putting
him down. Fragments put the other one down. All of the
American grenades EXPLODE.

The Japanese with his foot off lies still a moment, then
struggles up to sit, holding another grenade as the blood
pours from his severed leg. Doll SHOOTS him. He falls back
dropping the ignited grenade beside him. It does not go off.

GAFF
Again! Again!

Again six grenades arch in the air. This time there are four
Japanese standing when the grenades light, one of them
carrying a light MG. The EXPLODING grenades put three of them
down, including the man with the Nambu, and the fourth,
thinking better of it, disappears down a hole.

GAFF
Go in!

In a moment, all of them are on their feet running. The
Japanese have shrewdly taken advantage of the terrain to save
themselves digging work. Behind the holes into the
emplacements themselves is a natural little low area where
they can come out and sit in cover when they are not actually
being shelled. Now in this hollow the scrawny, bedraggled
Japanese rise with rifles, swords and pistols from their
holes to meet Gaff and his crew. At least, some of them do.
Others stay in the holes. Three try to run. Dale SHOOTS one
and Bell SHOOTS another. The third disappears in a grand
broad jump over the edge of the rock face where it falls
clear, sixty or eighty feet to the jungle treetops below. The
others come on. And Gaff and his troops, the Captain blowing
his whistle, run to meet them, in clear view of the rest of C-
for-Charlie down at the ledge below.

Queen kills five men almost at once. His SHOTGUN blows the
first nearly in two and tears enormous chunks out of the
second and third.
121.

While he struggles to unsling the rifle from his back, he is
attacked by a screaming officer with a sword. Gaff SHOOTS the
officer in the belly from the hip. Bell has killed two men
and Dale two. Doll, who has drawn his pistol, is charged by
another screaming officer who shouts “Banzai!” over and over
and who runs at him whirling his bright, gleaming sword
around his head in the air. Doll SHOOTS him through the chest
so that, in a strange, laughable way, his legs keep right on
running while the rest of him falls down behind them.

Witt peers into a cave. A bat flies out, startling him. A
soldier approaches with a flamethrower at the ready.

Witt has SHOT three men, one of them a huge, fat sergeant
wielding a black cavalry saber. Taking the overhead saber cut
on the stock of his rifle, cutting it almost to the barrel,
Witt butt-strokes him in the jaw. Now he SHOOTS him where he
lies. Suddenly there is an enormous quiet, except for the
wailing chatter of three Japanese standing in a row who have
dropped their weapons.

Slowly, they look around at each other and discover the
miraculous fact that none of them is killed, or even
seriously damaged. Gaff has a knot on his jaw from firing
without checking his stock. Bell's helmet has been shot from
his head. Numbly, they stare at each other.

Queen now advances, snarling, on the three standing Japanese.
Taking two by their scrawny necks, he shakes them back and
forth, gaggling helplessly until their helmets fall off.
Then, grinning savagely, he begins beating their heads
together.

QUEEN

Fucking murderers! Fucking yellow
Jap bastards. Killing helpless
prisoners! Fucking murderers.

The others stand breathing hard and watching. When he drops
them, they fall unconscious, blood running from their noses.

QUEEN
That’11 teach them to kill
prisoners.

He turns to the third, who simply looks at him
uncomprehendingly. But Gaff jumps in between them.

GAFF
We need him.

Queen walks away without a word. It is then they hear the
first SHOUTS from the other side, and remember they are not
the only living.
122.

Going to the grassy bank, they see the same field they
themselves tried to cross last evening. Coming across it at a
run, the rest of C-for-Charlie is charging uphill toward the
strongpoint, according to Colonel Tall's plan, coming
straight at them, yelling.

Whatever their reason, they are little late. The fight is
already over. Or so everyone thinks. Waving and cheering
ironically and hooting derision at the heroes, their
pretended rescuers, Gaff’s men are interrupted by the sound
of a MACHINE GUN. Directly below them, in one of the
apertures, a single MG opens up and begins to FIRE at 2nd
Platoon. As Gaff’s men watch incredulously, two men go down.
Dale, who is standing nearest to the door of the embrasure
which is FIRING, leaps over with a shocked look on his face
and throws a grenade down the hole. The grenade immediately
comes flying right back out. Everyone hits the dirt.
Fortunately, the grenade has been thrown too hard and it
EXPLODES just as it falls over the lip of the rock face. The
MG below continues to FIRE.

WITT
(to Dale)
Look out, you jerk!

Scrambling to his feet, Witt pulls the pin on a grenade and,
holding it with the lever depressed, grabs his rifle and runs
over to the hole. Leaning around the right side of it
holding his rifle like a pistol in his left hand with the
stock pressed against his leg, he begins to FIRE the
semiautomatic Garand into the hole. There is a YELL from
below. Still FIRING, Witt pops the grenade down the hole and
ducks back. He continues to FIRE to confuse the occupants.
Then the grenade blows up with a ROAR, cutting off both the
scrabble of yells and the MG, which has never stopping
firing.

Immediately, others of the little force, without any
necessity of orders from Gaff, begin bombing out the other
four holes using Witt’s technique: one man FIRING while
another tosses the grenades. They BOMB them all, whether
there is anybody in them or not. There is a joyous feeling in
the safety of killing. Slapping each other on the back and
grinning at each other murderously, they call to the C-for-
Charlie men below to come on.

Colonel Tall appears at the top of the embankment, followed
by Captain Stein. Two of the platoons continue pushing uphill
to protect the new position. Tall shakes Gaff's hand.

COL. TALL
Look at them move! We owe it all to
you, John. When they saw you make
that attack of yours, and win!
(MORE)
123.

It was lik€Olou TAldutcametic¢) hearts
back into them.

The Japanese, two dozen of them, lie scattered around in
various positions and postures. Some are still in the process
of dying, and a few, though badly hurt, look as if they might
live.

DOLL
It was Big Un and his shotgun. He
set ‘em back on their heels.

Queen prowls back and forth and around the single remaining
prisoner, like a loose wolf trying to get at a caged victim
He appears to be waiting hopefully for the Japanese to make
any move for which he can legitimately kill him. The prisoner
himself looks as though he would not be capable of escaping
anywhere, even if there were no one around to watch him.

Filthy and emaciated, he has a bad case of dysentery and is
continually indicating to his guards, through a system of
signs and pantomime, that he has to relieve himself. He has
already messed his pants a couple of times apparently, and
all in all, he is a pretty sorry spectacle.

COL. TALL
What happened here?

Tall has turned away in disgust from the living prisoner to
look at the two whose heads Queen knocked together. They lie
side by side, unconscious. Except for the blood running from
their noses, they show no signs of injury or wounds. Gaff
merely raises his eyebrows, as though he didn’t know either.
But Tall can read well enough what has happened, even if he
cannot understand the method. They should have been
bayoneted, or shot. He doesn’t like this sort of thing, but
one has to make allowances for men in the heat of combat.

COL. TALL

Some sort of explosive concussion?
No fragment wounds.

(Gaff does not answer)
Well, a dead brown brother is one
brown brother less, isn't it? Take
good care of the others, men! G-2
will want them. There should be
someone around before long.

THORNE
Aye, aye, sir, yeah. We'll take
care of him.
124.

One of the PRISONER'S GUARDS reaches out with his rifle
muzzle and pokes him, tipping him over backward into his own
mess. The men around all laugh, and the prisoner scrambles to
his feet. He appears to expect this kind of treatment and
looks as if he were only putting in time, waiting for them to
shoot him.

STEIN
Say there!

COL. TALL
Don't do that, soldier!

THORNE
Okay, sir, if you say so, sir. But
he would of killed me in a minute
if he'd had the chance.

COL. TALL
I think we've wasted about enough
time here.

GAFF
Sir? Sir, I've got a few
recommendations for decorations I'd
like to turn in to you.

COL. TALL
Yes, yes, of course. We'll get
everything for all of them that we
can. But later. In the meantime, I
want you to know I'm personally
recommending you for something,
John. Perhaps -- the Big One.

GAFF
Well, thank you, sir. But I don't
feel I really deserve that

COL. TALL
Oh yes you do. Getting it for you
will be another problem. But it
would be a big thing for the
battalion, and for the regiment
too, if you did get it. We better
get moving out or here. We need to
extend our lines to hook up with
the other companies and push on
toward the top. Would you like to
take command of Baker Company, on
the left?
125.

Gaff steals a glance at Stein, then nods uneasily. He will
not be a party to a snub.

GAFF
Sir, I don’t like to be a wet
blanket or anything like that, but
what about water? If we don’t --

COL. TALL
Don't worry about water! John, I
don't want anything to break up
this attack of ours, now that we've
got the momentum. As for water
I've already taken care of that.
We'll have some water by -- ina
couple of hours. I've arranged for
that. We can’t stop now to wait for
it.

 

GAFF
No, sir.

COL. TALL
If some of the men pass out
they'll just have to pass out.

(as Gaff nods)

If any of them ask you about water
tell them what I said. Don't bring
it up yourself. Don't mention it
unless they ask you.

GAFF
No, sir. But they could die from
it, you know. Heat prostration.

COL. TALL
They could die from enemy fire,
too. They’re all tough boys. Okay?

He turns away to wave his baton at some of the men who are
still staring curiously at the various dead Japanese.

COL. TALL
You'll see plenty more of those.
Come on, let's get cracking. Are we
going up this hill or aren't we!

On a sudden impulse, Tall returns to Gaff and, taking his
arm, leads him gently away from the others.

COL. TALL
John, I'm convinced the Japanese
position can be broken now.
(MORE )
126.

All we hav€Oto da\lils( ¢@eb'Gbing and
we'll have this hill by sundown.
You see the new spirit in these
men! I want to take advantage of it
before something happens to sap
their strength.

(avoiding Gaff’s eyes)
To have this battalion relieved in
defeat, even to have it reinforced
by troops from the reserve regiment
if we stall before reaching the

top, is -- more than I can stand.
Someday you'll know what I mean,
John.

He's studied, and worked, and slaved, and eaten untold
buckets of shit, to have this opportunity. He doesn’t intend
to lose it now. He leaves Gaff and, without looking back at
him, calls out suddenly to the assembling men.

COL. TALL

I want three runners! Okay. You
three. Go back to the rear, as far
as you have to go, to find water
and bring it back with you. Take
whatever you find, at gunpoint if
necessary. Don't even report to the
regimental commander. Get back here
as fast as you can with it. If they
stop you, tell them the strongpoint
is taken, we're moving uphill. If
anyone tries to take any water from
you, you're to fight for it, with
your firearms.

(to Stein)
You take the center, Captain. Gaff
and I will bring the other
companies up, on the left and
right. Wait an hour for us to get
them in place. Then attack! we'll
throw everything we've got at them.
Once the companies are linked up
we'll move uphill together ina
line. Nothing's stopping us. We're
going all the way. High ground by
nightfall!

He raises his arm in the air, and a CHEER goes up from the
group of men around him. Lt. Band looks at him with awe.

COL. TALL
(to Band, privately)
Lieutenant, last night they cut our
phone lines back to the rear.
(MORE)
127.

Don't be itQdny TAbt (cat répair
them. We attack in one hour! It is
now twelve thirty-eight on my
mark... Mark!

While Tall and Gaff go off, Stein takes Lt. Band aside.

STEIN
George, I can't look after
everything. I'm putting you in
charge of Becker's platoon, and
Weapons. It will be like an
independent command.

LT. BAND
Let us lead it off, sir.

STEIN
(after eyeing him warily)
All right.

Band smiles his eager smile. An independent command!

Meanwhile, a group of men from C-for-Charlie has gathered
around the Japanese prisoners, fascinated by the first sight
of their enemy, living and breathing, though strangely so
unformidable. Eight more nave been rounded up and aced under
guard with the one Queen spared. They are being interrogated
by a timid young OFFICER from G-2 and a NISEI INTERPRETER.

The prisoners are a sorry, sick-looking lot. Feeble,
stumbling, they shamble along appearing to be totally
benumbed by their experiences and looking as though they
would not have the energy or the will to escape, even if they
were guarded by just one GI. All of them are suffering from
dysentery, jaundice and malaria. Two of them (just why, no
one seems to know) are stark bare-ass naked. They look like
some lower grade of animal, with their ribs and shoulder
bones showing starkly through their yellow skin.

NISEI INTERPRETER
They say they've all been living
off lizards and the bark off of
trees for the past couple of weeks.

DOLL
Ask ‘em if they was scared.

Doll gives one of them a cigarette as the Nisei translates
the question. The Japanese man looks embarrassed but
grateful.
128.

NISEI INTERPRETER
He says they were too sick to feel
much of anything. They were sorry
to see their captain die.

THORNE
Hey, Jap. Come on, Jap! Tell the
truth! Ain't you glad you don't
have to fight no more now? Hunh?
Ain't you?

The Japanese man he addresses, who obviously does not
understand a word, bobs and bows and nods his head smiling
numbly.

THORNE
See there! I told you! They don't
want to fight no more than we do!
What's all this Emperor shit!

TILLS
Just you don't give him your loaded
rifle, and then see how much he
want to fight.

G-2 OFFICER
We need to get these prisoners back
to Regiment as soon as possible. I
need a detail.

They ignore him. One of the prisoners, a SERGEANT who
declined a cigarette when one was offered him, speaks quietly
to the Nisei.

THORNE
What'd he say?

NISEI INTERPRETER

Nothing.

THORNE
What do you mean? I saw him talking
to you.

NISEI INTERPRETER

He said that if he acted that way
in front of his lieutenant, the
officer would pull his gun out and
shoot him.

(as Thorne smiles lamely)
He keeps asking me, how can I do
this?
129.

EXT. HILLSIDE - DAY

The prisoners are being led away by their guards, among them
Thorne, Coombs, Carni and Kirk. Whooping and hollering, they
descend the steep hillside in a sort of nonsensical hysteria
of cruel fun, slipping and sliding, booting the prisoners and
laughing whenever they fall. When one of the charges falls

so ill that he can hardly move, however, they stop, to
discuss the situation.

THORNE
I say shoot the fucker.

COOMBS
You know the Colonel ordered us to
get them all back alive.

THORNE
So we'll say he tried to escape.

COOMBS
Him? Look at him.

THORNE
So who'll see him?

KIRK
I'm with Thorne. Remember what they
did to our guys on the Bataan Death
March.

COOMBS
Shorty gave us personal orders. You
know damn well he's gonna check up
if one turns up missin’. What if he
has Intelligence ask these other
guys what happened to their buddy?
I don't want to get in trouble,
that's all.

The Japanese senses he has a champion in Coombs and bows
gratefully.

THORNE
Well, it’s either that or carry
him. I’m not about to carry no
fuckin’ Jap all the way back to
Regiment. Are you? Anyway, I
outrank you. I’m a corporal. I say
kill him. Look at him. Be doin’ the
poor fuck a favor.
130.

KIRK
2nd Battalion found where they'd
been eatin’ one of their own men.
Strung him up from a branch like a
deer. Took strips off his back, two
inches wide. They eat people.

Carni steps forward and puts in for the first time. He has
been thinking it over, the pros and cons.

CARNI
Coombs is right. Shorty’s sure to
check up if one is missin’. If we
shoot him or lose him, he’1l be on
our ass like a bullwhip. Might even
court-martial us.

Thorne stares at the Japanese man, then shrugs and grins
ruefully.

THORNE
Okay, I guess you're right. It
looks like we carry him. All right
then! Come on! I'll take a leg! who
wants the rest of him!

EXT. CP - DAY

Fife and Storm have returned to the company. They are treated
as objects of extreme curiosity, even in the midst of the
battle. Men who’ve come back from the gone! Questions fly in
from all sides. Everyone in the company who has not been hurt
beyond the normal minor bruises and cuts carries the guilt of
a well man who, through no fault of his own, has not
suffered.

STORM
They didn't do a fucking thing.
Didn't even put a bandage on the
fucking thing! Them doctors are
tough. They're not lettin’ anybody
get out of anything if they can
possibly help it. The shit's hit
the fan, boys. Govmint don't have
to lock you up behind bars.

Fife reports to the CP to discover that he is out of a job.
CORPORAL WELD mans the sound-power phone, though of course it
is not working. Weld is now Welsh's Forward Echelon clerk.

FIFE
What’re you doing with my phone?
131.

WELD
Hello there, Fife!

Weld looks at him with a cold-eyed, insolent smile. It is
strange what a little authority and a coup le of stripes can
do for a man. Weld is a big, unfriendly-looking soldier; Fife
has always been a little afraid of him. He is obviously not
about to turn loose of his newly acquired status if he can
help it.

WELSH
What do you want, kid?

FIFE
I came back from the aid station.
I'm supposed to report in.

His anger cannot even begin to overcome in him his sense of
lostness, war terror and terrible aloneness.

WELSH
Okay. So you've reported.

FIFE
What's Weld doing with my
telephone?

WELSH

Corporal Weld is my Forward Echelon
clerk. Them other two punk assholes
there are his assistant runners.
Here, fuckface!

(holding a paper out to

Weld)
Take this over to Culp in Weapons.

WELD
Right, Sarge!

He takes the paper and turns around, throwing out his chest

WELD
Train! Here!

WELSH
I_said TAKE it!

WELD
Right, Sarge!

He leaves. Welsh turns to Fife with his crazy, sly-eyed grin.
132.

FIFE
You knew I might be coming back.
You knew I was --

WELSH
Knew you were comin' back! How the
hell would I know you were comin'
back? I thought you were walkin'
off lookin' for a bush to die in. I
got a company to run here. You
think it can wait for you? If you'd
had any fucking guts or brains
you'd of got yourself evacuated off
this Rock, with a wound like you
had.

FIFE
You can't do this to me, Welsh! By
God, you can't! You can't take and--

WELSH
I can't, can't I! Look around you!
It's done! It was done last night
while you were at the aid station.
You can't blame me if you didn't
have guts or brains enough to --

FIFE
Goddamn you, I notice you didn't
make anybody mess sergeant in
Stormy's place!

WELSH
(grinning insolently)
Storm asked me to wait -- he
thought he might be comin’ back.

Why does it make his heart sink to find he is no longer
Welsh's clerk? Why doesn't he rejoice?

FIFE
Goddamn you, Welsh! Goddamn you,
you son of a bitch!

WELSH
I'm getting tired of teaching you
punk asshole kids that you don t
mean a goddamn thing to the world.
Not to the country, not to the war,
to nobody. This Army's going to
spend you like dollar bills.

(MORE )
133.

You can al WELSH (conta\d by day, one
by one -- and it won t mean a
goddamn fucking thing to anybody as
long as there's replacements. Who
the fuck do you think you are? You

think you mean anything to this
comp 'ny?

 

Welsh could not have chosen a more wounding thing to say. He
knows it and falls silent for a moment, as though ashamed.

WELSH

You punks are all learning now --
and Oh does it hurt! This war's
only starting. Behind this comp'ny
there's ten others like it,
stretching clear back to
Washington, all of them dedicated
to getting you up here full
equipped to get your asses lowed
off. You’re just part of a machine.
You’re a cog. You can't doa
fucking thing about it. This ain't
no war, this is a regulated
business venture.

(after a pause)
You don't know no more about it
than a pig knows about Sunday.

Since yesterday Welsh has the same drawn, haunted face and
wrinkled, too-bright eyes they all wear, but unlike them, he
feels triumphant -- triumphant because everything has turned
out exactly as he anticipated, thus leaving him with no real
shock or trauma, rather with his iron contempt intact.

FIFE
You don't believe in nothing, do
you, Welsh?

WELSH

Property! I'm the only sane man in
the fucking outfit.

FIFE
You bastard!

Fortunately, Lt. Band appears at just this moment. Welsh
leaps up to shout "Attention!" while he, Weld and Fife all
snap to.

LT. BAND
You don't have to call attention
every time I show up, Sergeant.
I've told you that.

(MORE)
134.

Certainly hdt BAND eEchte'ld) well!

Hello there, Fife! So you made it

back. We're glad to have you back

with the old outfit. Have you seen
my helmet?

Band takes off his helmet and shows Fife where a Japanese
bullet has passed through the shell. Fife listens to him in
silence.

FIFE
Well now, that's remarkable, sir! I
wish I could have seen my helmet. I
never saw it.

Fife's voice shakes with fury, and Welsh grins to himself.
Everybody in the company has already heard about Band's
helmet.

LT. BAND
It's too bad you couldn't have kept
it for a souvenir. Well then!
Corporal Fife! I guess we better
decide what to do about you, then,
Fife. Hunh? Since Weld here is now
corporal and clerk, we can't very
well demote him back to private.
Neither can we have two clerks. And
since Weld is older than Fife
besides being considerably less
well-trained I don't see how we can
send him off to take second command
of a rifle squad.

All Fife's anger runs out of him like water as he realizes
the tack Band is taking, and he decides, too late, that he
could have been much nicer about Band's helmet. Terror
balloons in him as he remembers that hellish exposed slope
down there.

LT. BAND
Soo -- How would you like to become
second in command of a top-rated
rifle squad, Fife? Sergeant Jenks's
squad of the 3rd Platoon has no
corporal. You'll see plenty of
action! I guarantee it!

WELSH
Sir, Sergeant Dranno back at Rear
Echelon has been devilling me to
give him someone to help him. He's
had a lot of work over casualties
since this action.

(MORE )
135.

And he's giliSH{aanta'dpt more.
Fife here has more clerical
knowledge than anybody in the
company except for Dranno.

LT. BAND
All right! Now you have a choice,
Fife! which do you prefer?

FIFE
I'll work for Dranno.

LT. BAND
All right! When do you want him to
leave, Sergeant?

WELSH
Today.

LT. BAND
There you are, Corporal! Okay. You
can go.

NEW ANGLE

Fife walks off nodding, but once he is alone, the rebellion
comes. All of his fury returns, his fury at Welsh, his fury
at Band, his fury at the world. Fuck them. Fuck them all.

VOICES
Moving out in ten minutes! Check
your ammo! Fix bayonets!

He knows what he feels is unrealistic; he knows he will
regret it immediately; he is sure he is signing his own death
warrant; but in spite of the fear and terror which fill him
in equal parts with fury and sorrow, he will not go back
there to work for Dranno. He finds Band still with the first
sergeant.

FIFE
Lt. Band, sir, I changed my mind.
I'd like to stay. I'd like to go
with the rifle squad.

Welsh's face turns so red it appears his whole head will
burst, but he says not a word in front of Band. The
Lieutenant gives Fife a curiously sharp look which makes Fife
wonder if he has not been actually and actively seduced. But
it is too late now.

LT. BAND
Okay. Report to Jenks's squad.
136.

As Fife anticipated, no sooner does he leave than he
immediately regrets what he has done. The only real pleasure
was the look on Welsh's face.

EXT. CP AREA - DAY

Ten minutes ago Becker's men were laughing and proud. Now,
suddenly, they are quiet, their eyes starry with fear. Becker
comes to Lt. Band with a deeply frowning face.

BECKER

Lieutenant, I was wondering if you
couldn't put my platoon in company
reserve. My boys’ve had it tougher
than any of the other platoons.
They've had more casualties, and
are more under-strength. They
deserve a break.

(after a pause)
It ain't fair to put my boys out
there all the time.

Band might have acceded to the request if Becker had not
spoken. Now he jerks his head up to stare at him.

LT. BAND
Fair? What's not fair? What's fair
got to do with it? No, I'm afraid
I'll have to deny your request
Sergeant. Your platoon is the best
we've got. They've got more
experience, they're tougher, they
belong out in front.

BECKER
Is that an order then, sir?

LT. BAND
I'm afraid it is, Sergeant

BECKER
In other words, the more of us get
killed gettin’ experience, the more
of us got to get killed usin’ it.

LT. BAND
As I said, fair has nothing to do
with it. Unfortunately. In a war
everything useful has to be used.
Here it's me who decides what is
most useful where. Any other
questions, Sergeant Becker?
137.

BECKER
No, sir.

LT. BAND
Then that's all.

BECKER
Aye, aye, sir!

Becker scuttles away in a blind rage. Poor man, Band thinks,
believing he has handled it pretty well.

LT. BAND
Sergeant!

Becker swings around. He is only fifteen feet away. Nobody
else is close enough to overhear what Band now says.

LT. BAND
I want to tell you something,
Sergeant. Do you know why our
platoon's going up first? Do you
know why they're moving out first
today in this attack? Because I
volunteered us for it.

BECKER
You what!

Becker crouches almost as if to charge him. Band raises his
eyebrows. Becker is too old a hand not to know what this
means.

BECKER
Sir!

LT. BAND
That's right. And do you know why I
did? It was because I felt, with
our superior combat experience,
we'd be more useful. To Regiment
to the Division, to everybody.

BECKER
Is that all, sir?

LT. BAND
That's all, Sergeant.
138.

EXT. WATER HOLE - DAY

2nd Platoon has discovered a little water hole. The men lie
around it on their bellies drinking the muddy water up
greedily, until Doll wades out into the middle of the hole
and pulls a dead Japanese soldier up from the bottom by the
scruff of his neck. All of them recoil in disgust, all except
Dale.

DALE
Everybody's got to drink a little
enemy blood. Some time or other

BECKER
Let's go. Bell's squad up on the
right! Dale's squad up on the left!
Make a line, make a line! Lock and
load!

EXT. FLANKS (BURNT SLOPES) OF HILL 210 - DAY

Jenks's squad will lead it off. Mazzi kisses a mortar round
and drops it down the tube, as they begin to lay down FIRE on
the slope above them. Fife sits watching a pair of blue
butterflies bounce above the grass tops. As he gets himself
ready, he can hardly believe what is happening to him. It
takes every ounce of courage he has not to turn and run. As
they start to crawl away, his teeth are chattering and he is
shaking like a leaf from head to toe.

JENKS
Come on, damn it! Get movin’!

Fife's heart beats wildly as MUSIC comes in through the
Japanese drums. He realizes this is his moment of truth, his
moment to become a soldier, a man. How precious this despised
world seems to him, now that he stands on the verge of
leaving it forever! Thorne's cries and moans when he go's
down nearby unnerve him further. Why can't he keep his mouth
shut? Fife did.

Gradually, a new courage swells inside him, a joy. He tries
to do better, helping Jenks keep the squad together
pretending he is not unnerved, that he is not thinking of all
the unreckonable ways to get killed. Fear drops away from him
like a shroud, and miraculously he is free.

The speed and power with which C-for-Charlie moves up Hill
210 is more than even Tall hoped for. Within fifteen minutes
they have hooked up with the other companies and the whole
line is bowling along uphill.
139.

The Japanese they flush from their holes and various
emplacements, which literally honeycomb the ridge, are almost
without exception the same starved-looking, sick, emaciated
types they found at the strongpoint, only now most are burned
or blackened by the fires that have spread across the slope.

EXT. FLANKS OF HILL 210 - DAY
A YOUNG SOLDIER turns to Witt.

YOUNG SOLDIER
I never been shot at before. Is
this what it sounds like?

WITT
This is what it sounds like. We’re
bein’ shot at.

Witt sees the Colonel far below. Until today, he has never
really much liked Tall, finding him a cold fish-eye of an
intellectual textbook soldier. But today he loves them all,
passionately, with an almost sexual ecstasy of comradeship.
Even Bugger Stein and Welsh come under the magnanimous aura
of his warm affection today. The idea of service to humanity,
of comradeship, of the solidarity of men, is slowly perishing
from the world, but in Witt it still runs strong.

Watching the first wave move up the hill, he feels the
mysterious quality of deep, manly friendship which can exist
between men who share the pain and death, the fear and
sadness of combat -- the happiness, too. For there is
happiness. Happiness in doing your best, happiness in
fighting by the side of your friend, happiness in feeling the
highest in yourself may be drawn forth at last.

Witt mutters under his breath. If Tall had let Bugger proceed
with his outflanking move, they might have saved themselves a
lot of good men. He turns to Bell.

WITT
I could’ve kept tella from getting
killed. Catch, Gordon. I wasn't
able to help a one of them! I can't
be everywheres at once!

VOICES
What's holding you up? Keep moving!
What's holding you up?

A wandering squad of Japanese COUNTERATTACKS the Weapons
Platoon as they are coming up behind, catching them
completely off guard. There aren’t supposed to be any
Japanese around here. Finally, they are compelled to run.
140.

Buttplate in one hand and carbine in the other, Frankie Mazzi
swings around backward to crash through the face-whipping
screen of leaves. Once through, he swings to turn face front
again, and suddenly feels himself speared, caught, and then
held. He knows what it is, but he can’t think clearly enough
to do anything about it. Some thing has grabbed hold of his
ammo belt near his right hip bone. Unable to believe it,
plunging and cursing and listening to rifle bullets
SNICKERWHACK through the brush around him, he remains
tethered, still holding buttplate in one hand and carbine in
the other. And he knows he will still be here when they come
for him, shoot him, cook him, and eat him.

When two men from the mortar section push past him running
hurriedly and obliviously, he begins to call in a feeble,
moronic, plaintive voice the same word over and over.

MAZZI
Help! Help! Help!

To his eternal shame, it is Tills who comes back for him.
Eyes glaring wildly also, running hurriedly in a crouch, he
comes up, surveys the scene, and frees him. Mazzi has been
pushing and plunging forward all the time. Tills merely
shoves him backward two feet and the snag comes free. Then
making a lip-lifting mock of a grin, he spits brown from the
quid in his jaw, and runs on.

When they come out into the bright, eye-beating light of
safety behind their own still-advancing lines, they see the
other members of the squad already setting up, resetting the
bubble levels.

MAZZI
Just don't think it makes me like
you any better.

TILLS
Done thank ut makes me lack yew any
butter.

Mazzi stares at him with hatred, certain he will tell.

Meanwhile, Stein watches his men work their way around an MG
emplacement.

WITT
We took out that emplacement, sir.
We can go ahead.

Witt could throw his arms around his commander in an ecstasy
of loving comradeship. Except that it might get taken the
wrong way.
141.

STEIN
Good job, Witt. Why don’t you stay
here and have yourself a rest?

WITT
I ruther be with the comp’ny, sir.
I mean, you know, with the
platoons. I always feel like maybe
I could help somebody, you know?
Maybe save somebody.

It is the first time he has ever told anyone his secret.
Stein stares at him quizzically, and witt curses himself. He
learned long ago in his life never to tell anybody anything
about what he really felt -- what made him do it now?

STEIN
Okay. Report to Becker. Tell him I
just appointed you acting sergeant.

WITT
But I'm not even in the comp’ny,
sir, officially.

STEIN
We'll worry about all that later.
WITT
Aye, sir.
STEIN
Looks like we're in luck today,
witt.

Witt looks at him a moment, then nods and crawls away. Now,
before Stein can give the order, the platoons move out on
their own. Stein runs forward among them.

STEIN
Go on! Go on! Don't stop now!

He hears his own voice bellowing and he knows nobody can hear
him, but he cannot stop it, and he cannot stop waving his
arms. The men charge up until the crest of the hill comes
INTO VIEW.

STEIN
Hot damn! Hot damn! Come on! Come
on! We got to get up there.

He starts off through the grass running. Everything
everywhere seems to be ungovernable chaos with the FIRING,
the SHOUTS.
142.

STEIN
Keep your distance! Twenty yards!
Form a line!

Jenks's squad are on their feet before the grenade shower has
even EXPLODED. They run uphill, hollering and yelling. Fife
scampers along with them, panting and sweating. Nothing
touches him. On his right, the usually imperturbable Jenks
lets out a long, shrill, screeching, quavering rebel yell.
Three men go down hollering in the rush. Nothing touches
Fife.

Then, suddenly, they are in! Over the crest and in! -- the
other two squads right behind them, running hard but
cautiously between long, lovely lines of trees, leaping
emplacements like the ones they once looked at with awe and
wonder, gasping and weeping and, once in a while, dying. They
are in!

EXT. JAPANESE BIVOUAC AREA - DAY

Fife has no trouble shooting. When he first sees the scrawny,
tattered, scarecrow yellow men FIRING their rifles and MGs
intently, he can hardly believe it and feels astonished. When
he sees one Japanese in a hole whirl with a grenade in his
hand and stare at him wide-eyed, he SHOOTS him through the
hest and watches him fall. Then he looks around for more
targets and sees a Japanese running, trying to make the
jungle. Head down, arms pumping, he runs in total despair,
like a man on a too-swift treadmill which is carrying him
backward. Fife leads him just a hair and SHOOTS him through
t

t

a

°

he left side just below the armpit, shouting with elation as
he man tumbles with a yell just feet away from the jungle
nd safety.

hen Stein reaches the crest of the hill, he beholds a scene
hich will remain with him the rest of his life. His
loodthirsty platoons have burst into what is clearly a
apanese bivouac area. The tall jungle trees have climbed up
ut of the gulches and established themselves here on this
rest. The Japanese have cleared out all the undergrowth so
hat what is taking place here now is taking place as though
n some park. The only thing that is not like a park is the
lue mud which is everywhere the ground. In this natural
etting, Stein's platoons are SHOOTING and killing Japanese
n what appear to be carload lots.

BHNAHHOOUDEES

There are no tents visible, but there are surface shelters of
branches and sticks which the Japanese have made themselves,
and there are underground dugouts. The first are being SHOT
to pieces or knocked apart with rifle butts. The underground
shelters are being BOMBED OUT with grenades.

 
143.

Stein sees at a glance there wii1 be no way of getting these
men organized for quite some time. A crazy sort of blood
lust, like some sort of declared school holiday from all
moral ethics, has descended on them. They can kill with
impunity and they are doing it. Several Japanese plead for
their lives. One sits meditating as though preparing himself
for death.

Queen runs laughing and bellowing on, arriving back in time
to SHOOT a Japanese officer who, rising from a hole and
whirling his sword on high, runs at them screaming to die for
his Emperor. Queen tears the scabbard away from him, jams the
sword in it, sticks it all in his belt and rushes on.

VOICES
Queen's back! Romp and stomp!

QUEEN
Show me them Japs!

Fife scampers along SHOOTING every Japanese he can see,
filled with both terror and elation. Then Jenks goes down
with a loud squawk and a rifle bullet through the shoulder.

JENKS
You take the squad.

Now Fife has the squad to himself, and the responsibility,
and finds he loves it, and all of them. A new confidence has
surged up in him, a manliness; a wild, reckless joy.

The whole area is honeycombed with rifle pits and MG
emplacements, and it was obviously the Japanese commander's
intention to sell it very dearly. But now, having heard such
great enemy firing on their flanks and even in their rear,
the Japanese begin to come up out of their holes and
surrender, sick, haggard, beaten-looking men, obviously
terrified at the treatment they expect to receive at the
hands of their enemy. Those who make the mistake of coming up
with their weapons in their hands are taken care of
immediately.

The others, who come out empty-handed and hands up, are
socked, punched, beaten, prodded and hammered with rifle
butts, but rarely -- only in a few instances -- are they
actually killed. But nobody likes them very well, and those
who refuse to do as they are told are SHOT out of hand by
tense-faced, nerve-racked men who want no fucking nonsense.
One by one, the MGs are silenced. Some of the riflemen elect
to SHOOT it out and die in their pits. Others leap up and run
for the jungle leading to their own rear, if such a term as
"rear" applies in this crazy campaign. Few reach it. The
whole thing goes quickly.
144,

When they arrive at the center of the bivouac, they find the
majority of the Japanese KILLING themselves with grenades,
guns or knives, which is just as well because those who do
not surrender immediately are SHOT or bayoneted.

Stein looks around to see the other companies pouring in from
the left and right flanks. The main fight is over. C-for-
Charlie has borne the brunt of it and gained the victory. A
few of the men sit down and weep.

COL. TALL
Well, Stein, we did it, son! We did
it!

Colonel Tall strides up to Stein and shakes his hand. There
is further handshaking with the sergeants.

STEIN
Excuse me, sir. What about the
water? Have you --

COL. TALL
I'm sorry about that, Stein! Now
what do you think are the chances
of a counterattack? I still hear
gunfire over on the left.

The moping up proves to be a pretty big operation. There are
still many unreduced emplacements scattered across the
bivouac and the hillsides beyond it. Many of the Japanese
prefer to die rather than be captured. Some are too sick even
to surrender, and simply sit by their guns FIRING them until
they are killed. Those who have surrendered are overcome with
a deep shame and sorrow. End on: rice cooking or some
domestic scene, perhaps on a wind chime or a figure of the
Buddha sitting in obscurity beneath a stand of cocoa trees.

EXT. JAPANESE BIVOUAC AREA - DAY

Charlie Dale comes to Witt with a bone to pick. Witt is
sitting on a rock, staring emptily down the hill, sorrowful,
exhausted and terribly dry. The stocky Dale, with his
perpetually hunched shoulders and powerful long arms, marches
up and stands himself directly in front of Witt to have his
say. The SHOOTING is still going on.

DALE
I got somethin' I want to tell you
witt.
WITT
(absentmindedly)

Yeah? What's that?
145.

DALE
You shouldn't ought to talk to me
like you did. I don't want you to
do it anymore. That's an order.

WITT
What? When?

DALE
Back there at the strongpoint this
morning. You remember, Witt.

WITT
What did' I say?

DALE
You called me a jerk when I tossed
that grenade down that one hole and
that Jap tossed it back out. That's
no way to talk to me. I'm a noncom

now -- it ain't dignified. In any
case, I'm orderin' you not to do it
no more.

Witt looks as if he has been stung by a bee.

WITT
Arngh, come off it, Charlie. I
known you when you was a lousy
second cook. A not very good one at
that. I ain't takin any orders from
you. You can shove them acting
stripes up your ass.

DALE
You called me a jerk!

WITT
Well, you are a jerk! A jerk! A
jerk! What's more, you're stupid!
You should of known better than to
anyway, I'm an acting sergeant too
myself! Stein made me one an hour
ago! Now, peel off!

DALE
I'm not a jerk. And you wasn't no
acting sergeant when you done it.
Anyway, I was made before you so I
still outrank you. And I ain't
scared of you... Besides, it don't
look good in front of the men
witt.
146.

His voice softens as he thinks of the new thing. He says it
as if they were two majors bellying up to the Officers Club
bar.

WITT
Men, my ass! Dale, I never hit
nobody without I warn them first.
That's my policy. Well, I'm warning
you. Get away from me, stay away.
If you ever say another word to me,
I'll whip your ass.

DALE
I think I can whip you.

WITT
Then have a go! Have a go!

DALE
There's too much work to do around
here right now. The mopping up's
just starting. I don't want to miss
that.

WITT
Anything you want! Knives
bayonets, fists, rifle butts

shooting!
DALE
Fists’ll do. I don't want to kill
you --
WITT
You couldn't!
DALE
I know you been a boxer -- all that

shit. I can still whip you.

WITT
Yeah?

Witt advances on him, raising his rifle butt as if to stroke
him in the side of the head with it, but Dale backs off. He
raises his own rifle, which is bayoneted, into fighting
position.

DALE
Maybe I couldn't whip you. But
you'll know you been in a fight.
147.

WITT
Come on! Come on! Talk! Talk! Talk!

DALE
There's too much serious work to do
right now. I'll try you later,
buddy.

WITT
Any time!

Dale turns and walks away. Witt sits down, trembling with a
cold rage. Whip him! There isn't a man his size in the
regiment who could whip him. And he doubts there is anybody
in the regiment who could whip him at bayonet fighting. As
for shooting, he has been high gun in every regiment he's
served with for the past six years. Don't look good in front
of the men. Shit!

Meanwhile, Dale goes to work over the Japanese with a stolen
pair of piers, wrenching the gold teeth out of their mouths.
His sharp, red eyes dart left and right.

EXT. JAPANESE BIVOUAC AREA - DAY
They are carrying Thorne away on a stretcher.

THORNE
I'll be back! It'll take more’n a
flesh wound to keep me from coming
back to C-for-Charlie. I don't care
where they send me! I'll be back if
I have to stow away ona
replacement boat!

All the guys are shaking hands with the other guys from the
other companies, grinning at each other out of guys b from

faces. Many are curious about the Japanese. Carni, looking

through a billfold, displays a picture of a dead soldier's

girlfriend.

CARNI
Maybe his sister.

Mazzi and Tills glance at each other. Mazzi wonders if Tills
has told anyone what happened down the hill. It infuriates
him that he cannot enjoy the victory as wholeheartedly as the
others.

Fife does not take part in the poking and looking and
souvenir hunting because the corpses make him feel queasy and
vaguely guilty.
148.

He watches only for a moment, then he has to turn away. What
is wrong with him? If the rest of the guys can be this tough
why can't he?

The scavengers move quickly. Nearby one slips a watch off a
dead Japanese lieutenant. But really everyone is too tired,
too beat and thirsty and exhausted, to care about the loot.
Later, of course, they will all regret it. Doll comes up to
Fife with a big smile.

DOLL
The Colonel wanted to know who it
was up there at the front of the
charge, with Jenks's squad. The
Captain said it was you. Colonel
said, that man is a fire-eater, the
Japs better watch out. He wanted to
know your name and if you were a
sergeant.

Bell turns and looks at Fife. Someone else smiles, causing
Fife to blush. At last he feels their equal, a good man
capable of truth and sacrifice. Fife watches the clouds move
serenely across the wide tropical sky. His triumph has made
all things beautiful to him again.

EXT. JAPANESE BIVOUAC AREA - DAY

The blow falls late that afternoon. C-for-Charlie has cleaned
out the bivouac area and captured a number of heavy mortars
as well as two 70mm field guns and been placed along the
crest they have captured. The fierce heat is begining to
abate and the first signs of evening appearing, when Colonel
Tall calls Stein off to himself.

COL. TALL
Stein, I'm relieving you of your
command.

His young-old Anglo-Saxon face is set in stern lines. Stein
can feel his heart suddenly beating in his ears, but he does
not say anything. He cannot honestly say he hasn't
anticipated it.

COL. TALL
Lt. Band will take over for you.
I've already told him. So you won't
have to.

STEIN
(after a silence)
Yes, sir.
149.

COL. TALL
It's a hard thing to do, anda
difficult decision to make. I just
don't think you'll ever make a good
combat officer. I've thought it
over carefully.

STEIN
Because of what happened yesterday
morning?

COL. TALL

In part, in part. But it's really
something else. I don't think
you're tough enough. I think you're
too soft. Too softhearted. Not
tough-fibered enough. You let your
emotions govern you too much. I
think your emotions control you. As
I said, I've thought it over
carefully. In a war people, have to
get killed. There dust isn't anyway
around it, Stein. A good officer
has to accept it, and then
calculate the loss in lives against
the potential gain. I don't think
you can do that.

STEIN
I don't like to see my men get
killed.

COL. TALL

No good officer does. But he has to
be able to face it. Sometimes he
has to be able to order it. In any
case, it's my decision to make and
I've already made it.

 

STEIN
In a way, it's a compliment then
isn't it, Colonel?

COL. TALL
There's no point in making a
scandal. I don't want it in the
records of the battalion while I
commanded it, and there's no point
in your having it put down against
you on your records. This has
nothing to do with cowardice or
inefficiency.

(MORE)
150.

I'm going €OLLet Aldi eqyptl\d For
reassignment to the Judge Advocate
General's Corps in Washington for
reasons of ill health. You're a
lawyer. You had malaria yet?

STEIN
No, sir.

COL. TALL
Doesn't matter, really. I can fix
that. Anyway, you probably will
have it. Also I'm recommending you
for the Silver Star. I will
recommend it in such a way that it
will definitely not be refused.

Stein feels an instinctive, angry desire to protest the
medal, and half-raises his hand. But then he lets it drop.

COL. TALL
You might as well have the Purple
Heart, too.

STEIN
Why?

COL. TALL
For one thing, I notice a pretty
deep scratch on your left cheek
from hitting those rocks back there
yesterday. If that's not enough, I
also note a couple of blood streaks
from scratches on your hands
underneath all that mud.

He stares at Stein expressionless. Stein suddenly wants to

weep.

STEIN
Aye, aye, sir.

COL. TALL
I think it's best if you go back
right away, with the next batch of
wounded and prisoners. It's no good
for you to keep hanging around. The
quieter we keep this, the better it
will be for all.

STEIN
Aye, sir.

He salutes and turns away.
151.

A group of stretcher-bearers is descending down to where the
jeeps are finally making their way up the forward slope of
Hill 210, and Stein joins them, helping with the stretchers.
No one in C-for-Charlie has seen him leave.

But the word gets around quickly. In spite of Tall's wish to
keep it quiet, all of C-for-Charlie -- and, for that matter
the entire battalion -- knows within fifteen minutes that
Stein has been relieved. Many of the men and noncoms are very
angry.

DOLL
We got to make a protest.

BECKER
Who to? The Colonel? He'll throw us
in the can for even thinking such a
thing.

In the end it all tapers away to nothing but bitter mumble
But if the others are willing to assuage their consciences
this way, Witt does not feel he can let it go at that.

WITT
What's the matter with you? This
battalion is going to hell ona
sled. Band! For comp’ny commander?
I believe I know how to rekinize a
comp’ny commander. He ain't one.
Neither was Stein. He just become
one in the past two days, and look
what's happened. They're kicking
him out! Well, I don't wanta be in
this battalion no more. Not without
the Cap’n. Not as long as Shorty
Tall’s in command!

Witt paces off in a mood of supreme, disgusted fury. A cold,
implacable Kentuckyness has come over him. This business with
the Captain has put a cap on things.

EXT. COMPANY CP - DAY
Pulling his sharp chin down into his thin neck and setting
his narrow shoulders stolidly, he reports himself to the new

company commander at the CP shortly before dusk.

TRAIN
What are you doing here, Witt?

WITT
Minding my binness.
152.

That goddamned Welsh is there, of course. Band is sitting six
feet away from him, eating the last of a can of C-ration.

WITT
(to Welsh)
Private Witt requests permission to
speak to the comp’ny commander.

Witt does not let his eyes waver from the Sergeant. Welsh
stares at him grimly. Then he turns his head.

WELSH
Sir, Private Witt requests
permission to speak to the company
commander .

LT. BAND
Okay. Sit down, Witt, sit down.
Make yourself com-fort-able. But
you're not "Private" any more
you're “Acting Sergeant” Witt. I
heard Captain Stein made you one
this morning. You seen my helmet
witt?

 

WITT
No, sir.

Band bends and picks up the helmet. He sticks his finger
through the hole and waggles it at Witt.

LT. BAND
That's something, isn't it, hunh?
Shot it right off my head.

WITT
Yes, sir.

LT. BAND
I never knew these things ever
really protected anybody. I'm going
to keep this, the shell anyway --
take it home with me. But sit down
Witt, sit down.

WITT
I prefer to stand, sir.

LT. BAND
(his eager smile
vanishing)
Oh? All right, Witt. What was it
you wanted, Witt?
153.

WITT
Sir, I want to tell the Comp'ny
Commander that I'm returning to my
old outfit, Cannon Comp'ny. The
reason I wanted to tell the Comp'ny
Commander was so that if the
Comp'ny Commander noticed I wasn't
around, he'd know why.

LT. BAND
Well that isn't necessary, Witt. I
think we can arrange to have you
transferred. Don't worry about
being AWOL. You've been a pretty
valuable man the last couple of
days.

WITT
Yes, sir.

LT. BAND
You know, we're short of noncoms.
Tomorrow I intend to make all the
temporary ranks permanent.

A bribe. Witt can smell Welsh watching with supreme disgust
Band's eyes suddenly narrow above his still-smiling mouth.

LT. BAND
You still want to go? All right,
Witt. I guess there's really no way
I can stop you officially. Anyway,
I wouldn't want a man in my command
who didn't want to serve under me.

WITT

It's not that, sir.

(it is a lie, at least

partly)
It's that I don't want to serve in
a battalion -- that does to guys
what this battalion did to Captain
Stein.

He deliberately does not mention Colonel Tall. Band studies
him.

LT. BAND
Okay, Witt. But I feel that's not
up to us to judge. Every army is
bigger than any single man in it.
154.

WITT
Yes, sir.

LT. BAND

That's all, Witt. Oh, Witt!
(as Witt turns back)

Perhaps you'd like a letter to
present to your company commander
in Cannon Company attesting to
where you've been the past two
days. If you would, I'd be glad to
write one for you.

WITT
(impassively)
Thank you, sir.

LT. BAND
Sergeant, write a letter saying To
Whom It May Concern that Witt has
been with this organization the
past two days in the thick of the
fighting and has been recommended
for decorations.

WELSH
I hadn't got a typewriter.

LT. BAND
Don't argue with me, Sergeant!
Write the letter! Take this sheet
of paper and write the letter

WELSH
Aye, sir. Weld! Take this paper and
go over to that stump and write me
a letter. You got a pen?

WELD
Yes, sir!
WELSH
You heard what to put in the
letter?
WELD
Yes, sir!
WELSH

Okay. Move! And don't call me
"sir," fuckface.
155.

Welsh sits down and folds his arms and looks at both of them,
Witt and Band. Then suddenly he grins his crazy mad, furry-
eyed grin at both of them. Somewhere in that labyrinthine
mind of his, he is obviously lumping them together and
letting them know it.

When the letter is written and signed -- it takes only a few
moments -- Welsh hands it over. But when Witt takes hold of
it Welsh suddenly clamps his thumb and forefinger together,
not letting it go. When Witt exerts some pressure, Welsh
holds on, grinning that stupid, insane grin down into his
face. But when Witt lets go and is just dropping his arm,
Welsh lets go too, and the paper almost falls to the ground.
Witt has to catch it.

LT. BAND
There's no need to go now, Witt.
It's practically dark. You can wait
till tomorrow.

WITT
I ain't afraid of the dark
Lootenant.

Witt stares hard at Welsh, then he leaves. He is angry at
himself for wanting the letter. He should of left it, or
refused it in the first place. He didn't really need it.
Screw them all, the cheap bastards. Not a one of them has
lifted a finger to help poor old Stein. And if Band thinks he
can buy off Bob Witt with a sergeancy, or an offer to stay
overnight and maybe reconsider, he doesn't know his guy. He
wads the letter up and throws it away.

EXT. COMPANY CP - DAY
Band has sent Weld away and is alone with Welsh.

LT. BAND
Sergeant, I can't help noting a
tone of subtle ridicule in
everything you say. For some time
I've felt you're not always
properly respectful to the company
officers.

WELSH
Sir, you can have my stripes and my
job whenever you want them.

He means it, and Band knows he means it.
156.

LT. BAND
Sergeant, don't ever get the idea
you're indispensable.

WELSH
Lieutenant, nobody knows better
than me exactly how dispensable
every man in this outfit is.

Band feels himself outmaneuvered and decides not to push it
further.

EXT. COMPANY CP - DAY

Bell and some of the other men plead with Witt. Fife does not
plead but, sitting apart, stares evenly at him. Witt will
have to be the first one to speak, and he chooses not to.

BELL
Why don't you just stay? You know
you'd like to. If they get hold of
you back in the rear, they'll throw
you in the stockade.

WITT
Not me... I won't never come back
in this battalion long as Shorty
Tall commands it. No, sir. Much's I
might like to. That Shorty Tall
better stay away from me, or I'll
punch his head in.

BELL
(as Witt walks off)
You can't go back there tonight
anyway. You fool! You'll get your
ass shot off by some trigger-happy
sentry. Hardhead!

EXT. COMPANY CP - DUSK

Sgt. Welsh stands in front of a portion of the company,
reading an announcement from Col. Tall.

WELSH
This is from Colonel Tall: "Our
victory gives us the highest
reasons for pride. It will prove a
milestone in the battle for
Guadalcanal.

(MORE)
157.

We have suddStecarhe' highest
casualties in the division and have
captured the toughest objective.
Tomorrow the division commander
will arrive to make a personal
inspection of the line. After the
inspection we are to be relieved by
a battalion of the division's
reserve regiment. I have secured
for the battalion a week's rest off
the line."

Tall stands off from his CP by himself, listening in the
gathering dusk. He smiles to himself as he hears the distant
cheers. He flatters himself that he knows pretty well how
enlisted men work -- he ought to after fifteen years -- and
the news of the week's relief far more than offsets any
natural irritation over the inspection.

EXT. HILLSIDE - DUSK

Witt is descending the hillside in lonely bewilderment when
he meets Ash, the wounded 3rd Platoon scout, who grins at him
from the side of the trail.

ASH
I'd of had you, Kaintuck, if you
was a Jap -- long ago!

WITT

They leave you here?

ASH
I would of slowed them up. I don't
really mind. Medic fixed me up
before they left. I got plenty of
ammo and Welsh left me his pistol.
They'11 be somebody along for me
evenshully.

He seems about three-fourths drunk from shock, morphine and
the pain of his bandaged wound, which he displays for Witt.

ASH
Right in the knee. I'm out of this
war for good, Witt. But what the
hell're you doin' down here?

WITT
Some binness.
158.

He looks around, marvelling to find the terrain where they
lay so long in fear and trembling, now so peaceful, the pure
sky breathing on the land, the earth going her tranquil way.

ASH
Well, give all them boys my best.

WITT
You can come with me if you want.
I'll help you along.

ASH
Nah, it's nice and quiet and
peaceful here. Anyway, I'd slow you
up. Somebody’11 be along for me.

WITT
I'll remind them.

ASH
Okay.

Ash watches the dusk close around the vanishing figure of the
proud Kentuckian.

FADE TO:

EXT. DOWN FROM HILLS (DRUMSARA BIVOUAC) - DAY

They come down from the hills and out of the jungle with
their haunted faces and pool-deep, sea-dark eyes, lugging
every ounce of booty they can carry and looking more like
Bowery scavengers than soldiers.

No sooner are they at their bivouac in a coconut grove by the
sea than they begin getting blind, crazy drunk. It is a wild
mass bacchanalian orgy that will go on for days.

VOICES
Freedom! We won! We whipped their
ass! Hooooeee!

They are hardly down out of the trucks before the bottles,
left behind here by various men and catalogued carefully by
Storm, are out and being utilized. MacTae, the supply
sergeant, in an excess of guilty love, has pitched all of the
company's pyramidal tents and even set up the cots in them
complete with their blankets and mosquito bars. The kitchen
fly is up and the stoves are lighted. All the weary warriors
have to do is clamber down and start drinking seriously, as
soon as they can draw their marked bottles from Storm's
locked chests.
159.

BECKER
Avoid the sea. There's sharks out
there. In these islands they
worship the shark.

Bell sits alone while the others carouse, hunched over a
sheet of paper with a carpenter's pencil, writing a letter to
his wife. (Much of his letter may play against scenes of
Marty, back in the States, in Florida or perhaps in Hawaii.
He remembers the first time they saw each other, their first
touch or first kiss.)

BELL (V.0.)
You're everything that's soft and
tender, Marty. I love you. You have
no edges. You're like the snow,
that comes down and makes
everything pure and bright and
clean. Everything dies on this
island, but everywhere you go they
live.

A soldier with a fiddle plays "Midnight on the water." The
cooks toss grenades into a stream and collect the fish that
bob to the surface. Storm then creates for the company such a
fish fry that it makes the more fragile-minded weep for home.
All of them are a bit mad. The combat numbness, with its
starry eyes, drawn faces and thousand-yard stare, has not yet
left them. Those who did not have the foresight to stock
whiskey away drink Aqua Velva mixed with canned grapefruit
juice from the kitchen supply.

By nightfall almost everybody has vomited one or more times.
Several men get down on their hands and knees, in the
moonlight shining tranquilly down into the coconut groves,
and bay at the moon like wolves or hounds. Another group of
ten or twelve take off all their clothing and, bareass nude,
run tripping and dancing across the open field beside the
bivouac to swim in the Matanikau in the moonlight. And there
are at least nine fist fights. When the KLAXONS sound later
on several men stumble into the wrong slit trenches, while
one actually dives into a latrine.

BELL (V.O.)
You spread life and peace around
you. You come like the rain to
everything that's dry inside me and
like a starved root. You're the sky
and the clouds, you're what there
is beyond all this. You make my
blood sing, Marty. I don't see how
anything could keep me from you. I
go through the earth to you.

(MORE)
160.

I touch yoBEii(bentd long as
you're with me, there's nothing I'm
afraid of.

INT. MAZZI'S TENT - DUSK
Inside Mazzi's tent everybody is busy knocking Lt. Band.

KIRK
Fucking stupid fuck of a
lieutenant! Volunteered us! Taking
chances with us! Fucking with us!
You tellin' me he wasn't glad when
they relieved the Captain? He could
hardly keep from smiling. His mouth
was doin' like a worm.

MAZZI
So tell him! what the fuck's the
good of sittin' around here yackin'
about it?

Carni, slack-faced with malarial fever, and the leader of the
little Greater New York group of hep guys, looks over at him
and asks in a voice hollow with fever and cynicism:

CARNI
Why the hell don't you do it
yourself, then?

TASSI
Yeah, why don't yah?

KIRK
Yeah, why not? All's you got to
lose is that P-F-C you might get on
the next promotions list.

MAZZI
(getting up drunkenly)
All right, by God I will.

He marches out of the tent and staggers through the coco
palms toward Band's HQ tent. The others follow him at a
distance, sniggering happily, content to let him take the
dangerous chance alone. All, that is, except Carni,' who
cannot get out of his bed.

EXT. BAND'S HQ TENT - DUSK

Despair, hatred and unredeemable misery rage in Mazzi's heart
after the humiliation of his rescue by Tills.
161.

It had to be that fucking Tills! So far Tills has not told
anybody, but he might.

DOLL
(intercepting him)
You hated the Captain till they
sent him away. You said he didn't
know what he was doing.

MAZZI
Fuck you.

DOLL
What're you going to Band for? You
wanta tell somebody off, why don't
you find the Colonel?

KIRK
Watch out, Frankie! You could get
in trouble!

MAZZI
Fuck it! I don't care one way or
the other. I don't fucking care.
Worse it is, the better!

(toward the tent)

Come out, you son of a bitch! I
said came out, shiteater! Come out
and find out what the men in your
outfit think of you, Band! You want
to know what we think of you? Glory
hunter! Come on, volunteer us for
somethin' else!

From Band's blacked-out tent just the faintest hint of light
creeps out to the waiting men outside. Inside the tent
nothing seems to move. Other men have begun to gather around
too now, their grinning teeth white in the bright moonlight
Aware of them, Mazzi rages on, marching back and forth and
swinging his skinny arms, compounding insult and profanity
with great artistry.

MAZZI
You're a prick, Band! A schmuck!
C'mon out, I'll take you myself!
Everybody in this outfit hates your
guts! Did you know that! How does
it feel! How does it feel!

Finally the light in the tent goes out. Then the flap is
thrown back and Band stands in the doorway leaning on his
hand on the canvas. He sways ever so slightly, but says
nothing. Slowly the men begin to drift away awkwardly. The
fun is gone.
162.

MAZZI
You think that fucking hero helmet
means anything longside the good
dead men that are really dead?

KIRK
Let's git back to some ser-yous
drinkin'. Come on, Frankie.

MAZZI
And that's what we think of you! So
court-martial me!

He stalks off proudly. Band feels sick. To think he loved
them all like children! Mazzi's tight little Greater New York
clan congratulates him all the way back to the tents,
crowding around him to slap his back and shake his hand. Now
that Band's silent face is no longer before them, the fun has
come back.

MAZZI
I sure got him told! I sure got him
told! And he never said one word
back!

Then suddenly he sees Tills's mocking, lip-lifting face
square in front of him and is startled into a new hollow
apathy. He tries to brave it out, chuckling hollowly to his
new satellite Carni.

MAZZI
I sure got him told!

CARNI
You sure did!

Tills spits brown out of the side of his grin.

TILLS
You never got nobody tole nothin'.
Nothin' a tall. I know.

MAZZI
Don't you tell no lies, Tills!

TILLS
Lies? I'm only going to tell what I
know. When I feel like it, exactly
to the minute. That's the way it s
gonna be.

Tills smiles crookedly. Mazzi turns away in horror.
163.

INT. WELSH'S TENT - DUSK
Welsh and Storm are drinking too, but they appear cold sober.

STORM

Don't matter how much training
you've got, how careful you are,
it's a matter of luck whether or
not you get killed. It don't make
no difference who you are, how
tough a guy you might be, how much
you know -- if you re in the wrong
spot at the wrong time, you're
going to get it.

(heavily)
I don't care no more. I don't care
about nothing. First time I ever
felt this way.

He finds it very serious, almost a tragedy. Welsh's reaction
astonishes him.

WELSH

Sounds like bliss.

(after a moment)
I don't really feel it yet. The
numbness. Not like the rest of you
do. Maybe I just knew what to
expect. Maybe I was frozen up
already. I know it's the only thing
that saves you.

(with his sly-eyed grin)
Maybe if you work on it, you can
make it a permanent state. I'm
going to try.

Storm looks up, like a sleepy, bait-wise sea turtle.

STORM
Not me.

WELSH
I like all this shit, Storm. I like
being shot at. Guess I'll just go
till I drop in my tracks or some
Jap gets me. They can bury me while
I laugh.

Welsh watches the insects crashing mindlessly against the
lantern that hangs from the centerpole. He starts to get up
and keels over on his face.
164.

EXT. BIVOUAC - NIGHT

Somewhere in the midst of this great bacchanalian orgy Dol',
Fife and a few other men have stumbled into Queen. Queen is
raving -- drunk, miserable and alone.

QUEEN

I shouldn't ought to have knocked
those boys' heads together. Did you
see how the Colonel looked at me?
Did you see? Maybe those boys
wasn’t the ones, personally, that
did the ball-cuttin'. what'll I do
now? Maybe they didn't know nothing
about it. Maybe they was against
it. Forgive me!

DOLL
He was eatin’ mud before. He ate a
peck of dirt. He's gone.

Queen throws himself down in the mud and begins to weep
whimper and howl, biting his clenched knuckles and staring at
Doll and Fife with the wild eyes of a rabid animal, raving
half in incomprehensible gibberish, half in lucid phrases.

OTHER MEN (0.S.)
Give him air. Don't get close to
him. Let him breathe. Don't shine
that light in his eyes!

QUEEN

Forgive me! I done what I shouldn't
ought to have done. Some things you
can't take back! Help! Get away
from me! I don't belong with you!

He weeps and whimpers and goes on biting his knuckles
writhing as though in an epileptic fit. Looking in his eyes
Fife feels, more than yesterday in combat, the horror of war;
its power to poison the soul, its systematic reduction of men
to animals.

QUEEN
Forgive me!

OTHER MEN (0.S.)
Let him go! Stand back! What the
fuck kind of swipe was he drinkin'?
165.

INT. DIVISION HOSPITAL - DUSK

Welsh comes to find himself in a small section of the
division hospital reserved for first three graders. Storm has
come to visit him and is smoking a cigar. The colored ticket
for evacuation is already attached to the foot of his bed.

WELSH
So it was you that got me hauled up
here!

His crazy eyes glint with an insane feverishness. Storm
cannot tell whether it is the malaria or simply Welsh's
personality.

STORM
Knock off, First Sarn't. Just be
quiet and they're going to ship you
out of here. You got malaria.
You're bein' evacuated.

WELSH
You'll never get away with it.
You'll never beat me out of my job
Storm. I'm too smart! Anyway, you
may be okay in the kitchen --
you’ve got no head for
administration. I know you!

From down the aisle the frail young 2ND LT. DOCTOR who runs
the ward comes running with a wardboy.

2ND LT. DOCTOR
Now you just take it easy,
Sergeant. You've got a temperature
of a hundred and five and two-
tenths.

WELSH
You're in cahoots with him!

For answer the Lieutenant shoves him back on his pillow and
puts a thermometer in his mouth, at which point Welsh bites
the thermometer in two, throws it on the floor, leaps out of
bed and runs out the tent flap and back to his company.
166.

EXT. AIRFIELD (SOUVENIR MARKET) - DAY

In the morning the whole of C-for-Charlie descends en masse
to the airfield, spreads out over the undamaged or least-
damaged areas of it, and begins bargaining with the Air
Corps, trading souvenirs for the Scotch that the flyers bring
in each day from Australia with the generals' supplies, the
milk, meat and cheese.

It is like a vast Arab souk, a thieves' market, and the
bidding is fierce. A silk battle flag, preferably
bloodstained, is worth at least three Imperial quarts. A
"Samurai saber" is always worth five. Money is practically
Meaningless to everyone except the airmen.

BELL (V.0O.)

(with MUSIC)
The world seems crazy without you.
Away from you the world is unreal,
like a country you're leaving
forever and never coming back to.

(after a pause)
I look up in the leaves, I listen
to the crickets, I feel like
anything could be a sign from you.
When I'm with other people I feel
homesick for the mountain air I've
breathed with you. Loving you keeps
me pure.

(after a pause)
We're like two trees that have
grown together -- like ivy ona
wall. Nothing means anything
without you.

(after a pause)
Will peace ever come? I want to
stay changeless for you, Marty. You
get something twisted out of your
insides by all this filth and blood
and noise. Keep me through this
terror, Marty. Keep me through the
madness. Keep me through the blood.
Darling, hold me close tonight. I
love you.

EXT. DUSTY ROAD NEAR THE AIRFIELD - DAY
Drifting away bored, Fife sees Storm and Doll, Queen and a

few other men tramping down the dusty road toward Rear
Echelon HQ.
167.

FIFE
Where you going?

DOLL
We heard Captain Stein's around
here somewhere waiting to be
shipped out.

Fife decides to join them. Together they set out to pay their
respects to their company commander whom they once hated but
now admire, and to tell him goodbye.

INT. STEIN'S TENT - DAY

They find Stein at work in his tent sorting what few papers
he has. Their arrival takes him by surprise.

FIFE
Hello, Captain. When you leavin'?
STEIN
Tomorrow. I'm going to New Zealand
by plane.
DOLL

How'd you find your bags? we
looked, we couldn't find ours.

STEIN
I spent the last three days hunting
them down. They gave me the use of
a jeep. I enjoyed driving around.

DOLL
You ready to go?

Doll seems to have taken it upon himself to speak for the
others.

STEIN
Whenever they tell me... I would
have come to visit you but I felt
like being alone.

He takes a bottle off the little camp table and offers them
all a drink. There is only one glass in the tent so they all
take it straight from the neck of the bottle. When Stein sees
how appreciative they are, he reaches into his bags and hauls
out the three bottles he intended to take with him on the
plane and gives them to them. Under the influence of the
liquor, they soon are all talking at once, all babbling away
together. Stein feels curiously detached.
168.

DOLL
We want to thank you, sir, for
asking to make that flankin' move
and watching out for us -- for
keeping us together. We're sorry to
see you go. We feel like you got a
rotten deal.

STEIN
I'm not sure you're right. You
never know if you're doing any
good. That's the hard part. It
doesn't matter. I don't care. I'm
glad to be going.

FIFE
There's still time, we ought to all
go and make a protest --

STEIN
What for? What good would it do?
Anyway I want to go. You wouldn't
want to take away my chances of
getting evacuated, would you?

"No," they chant in unison. For God's sake, they wouldn't
want to do that.

STEIN
Leave it alone. Let it lay.

Why should he want to stay? Everyone is dying to get out. It
is the only sane thing to want. And yet he knows there is
something he found here that he will never find back there.
He knows it, and they know it, though none of them could say
what it is.

STEIN
Why should I care? Washington's
full of women. It's the big boom
town now. With my campaign ribbons
and medals, I ought to make out
pretty well. I could do worse.

Stein exchanges with Storm -- a look of secret knowledge.
Storm, like him, means to be one of those who lives if he
possibly can. And Storm, like him, does not feel at all
guilty.
169.

EXT. STEIN'S TENT - DAY

When they have left Stein stands in the door of the tent and
watches them straggle off with their whiskey, unshaven,
dirty, still in the mud-slicked fatigues from the battle.

Later, when the planes come over, he sits quietly in the
dark, without any fear, and listens to the BOMBINGS.

EXT. BIVOUAC - DAY

At the bivouac the drinking starts before breakfast. They
crawl out of their net-covered cots and have a good stiff
dolt of Australian Scotch. Breakfast is the only roll call of
the day by order of Shorty Tall; after that they are on their
own.

EXT. BIVOUAC (MAIL CALL) - DAY

The men crowd wildly around Corporal Weld as he passes out
the mail. Those who have reason to fear their names might not
be called linger back in the shade of the palms, where they
do not risk embarrassment or awkward questions. Fife
considers Bell a lucky man.

FIFE
Six letters!

BELL
That doesn't seem like so many.
She's got plenty of time to write.

Fife is feeling pretty cocky as the whiskey quietly grows
inside his splintered nerves. He has found out that he is
really much braver than he thought, and this gives him real
boy. It isn't so hard to be a real soldier after all.

With Jenks dead, Corporal Fife has become Sergeant Fife
leader of the 2nd Squad 3rd Platoon. He has saved at least
two of them once apiece and at least three of them have saved
him. He feels a fierce protective love for each and every one
of them. But there is one thing that still rankles him, and
that is the way that fucking son of a backbiting bitch Joe
Weld treated him in front of Welsh that day. Stealing his job
like a sneak thief. Then smiling at him that way.
170.

EXT. HQ TENT - DAY

Joe Weld and Eddie Train, the stutterer whose lap Fife landed
in in terror, and the new kid Crown are sitting out drinking
with two of the cooks when Fife saunters up to them, mouth
pursed, tongue rubbing slowly over his teeth, his arms
dangling.

WELD
Oh -- uh, hello there, Fife. We
were just --

FIFE

Sergeant Fife to you, Corporal. And
don't ever call me anything else!

Weld looks startled for a moment. Then his look of startle
turns into a placating smile.

WELD
Well, I guess you really earned the
title, Sergeant. The hard way. I
for one sure don't --

FIFE
Don't ass-kiss me, you cheap fuck.

WELD
Now. Now, see here.
(scrambling to his feet)
I never done...

He does not get to finish because Fife steps in and knocks
him down without a word -- without a sound, in fact, except
for the smack of his fist on the cheekbone.

WELD
Hey! Hey! I was just sitting here
drinking and talking and minding my
own business.

FIFE
Get up, cheap fuck! Get up, job
stealer! Get up, and I'll knock you
down again.

First nearby, then further off, he hears uncaringly the happy
cries of "Fight! Fight!" and the SOUND of men's feet running.

WELD
I don't want to fight you. I didn't
steal your job.

(MORE)
171.

It was WelslELa(carided me corporal.

Nobody knew you was coming back. I

don’t want to fight you, Fife.
(repeating it slyly)

I just want --

He doesn't finish. Instead, he makes a wild, lunging leap for
Fife's middle, to grapple. It doesn't succeed. Joyously, Fife
steps in again and left-hooks him. This time it is more
accurate, and on the jaw. It sends Weld rolling away wildly
to the ground, where he props himself on his elbows, shaking
his head. When he rolls over to sit up, Fife dives on him.

It is as though a sudden scrambled lightning bolt of happy
maleness and joyous masculinity has g lit Fife's skull,
blinding him with glory. On top of the groggy Weld on the
ground, he cuffs and pummels. Growling and cursing high in
his throat and crying "Job stealer!" over and over, he
punches with both fists and total abandon at the face below
him. Finally they pull him off of him.

FIFE
Lemme go!

Somebody helps Weld up. His nose is broken and bleeding. Both
eyes are puffed almost shut.

Blood runs from his mouth between his broken lips and he
looks bewildered.

Fife, standing unheld now and in command of himself again,
though breathing hard, stares at him feeling both happiness
and consternation at the destruction he has caused. He is
proud of himself, but he hasn't really meant to hurt anyone.
Train and Crown take the swaying Weld by the arms to lead him
away .

FIFE
Hey! Hey! Don't do that! Don't go!
Let's have a drink. No hard
feelings!

Fife marvels at how frail and hollow he seems, this man who
once stirred such a sinking fear in him. From ten yards away
Weld stops and looks back at him. He is weeping and at the
same time trying not to. He seems to be searching his fuddled
head for the very worst thing he can think of to call Fife.

WELD
You -- You clerk!
172.

FIFE
Okay. Be a jerk!
(turning to the two cooks)
Either of you guys want some?

He grins at them. Both of them, though they are bigger than
Fife, shake their heads in silence. Fife walks along rubbing
his bruised hands. Around them the men are beginning to
disperse now that it is over.

DOLL
Did you hear that? He called you a
clerk. What he is. You showed the
fucker.

FIFE
Leave me alone.

Fife's eyes flash with anger; he does not wish to be
congratulated. Doll does not take offense but, with a
delicate nod, lets the subject drop. He sees Fife is limping.

DOLL
What's the matter?

Just then a MESSENGER comes up from Rear Echelon, gasping for
breath.

MESSENGER
Col. Tall's been promoted. They're
shipping him out. Gaff and Lt. Band
too. The whole lot of them. We're
going back up!

EXT. PALM GROVE - DAY

Down in the palm grove Col. Tall talks with a small group of
newsmen. He has somehow come into possession of a jewel-
encrusted Samurai sword and carries it under his arm in place
of the baton. Captain Gaff and Lt. Band are with him, each
with his personal baggage. A jeep waits nearby, and a movie
camera records the scene.

COL. TALL
(smiling broadly)
Of course I'm glad of the
promotion. But it will be painful
to leave these men. I feel they're
in good hands, though. They've been
bloodied. They've tasted victory.
173.

A group of C-for-Charlie men watch from a distance. While
they are fond of Captain Gaff, his departure to glory -- word
is out he will be put up for the Medal of Honor -- leaves
them with a certain bitterness.

As for Old Shorty, who, after all, is being promoted because
of their shed blood, nobody really cares very much that he is
leaving. They aren't even watching as he is driven off.

 

EXT. JUNGLE ROAD (A MONTH LATER) - DAY

The scene shifts to the jungle again. A solitary figure humps
along under his combat pack with slung rifle and bandoliers,
thin and frail-looking, his head sunk deep into his helmet
shell. Storm, from his stove, sees the single figure coming
up the road.

EXT. STORM'S MESS TENT - DAY

Storm shakes Witt's hand fervently. From beneath the helmet,
in shadow, Witt's hard implacable eyes peer out like the eyes
of some ferret-like animal. They have not seen each other in
over a month.

STORM
Let me give you some food. You look
hungry, Witt.

Storm serves him all the fried Spam, dehydrated mashed
potatoes, and stewed, dehydrated apples his small belly can
hold. Then he breaks out an Imperial quart.

STORM
How’d you find us? What the hell
are you doing up here? Like this?
All by yourself.

WITT
I'm headin' back to the comp'ny.

He wipes his mouth with the back of his hand.

STORM
You're what?!

WITT
(with a grin)
Going back. Shorty Tall got
promoted.
STORM
You must be out of your mind.

174.

Witt's eyes turn slowly in their sockets to stare at him.

WITT
No, I ain't.

STORM
In the first place nobody knows
where they are. They're way to hell
and gone off on their own
someplace.

WITT
I can find them. Somebody's got to
know.

STORM
You must be off your rocker.

WITT
Why? It's the comp'ny, ain't it?
Tail's promoted, ain't he?

He looks straight at Storm out of his black Kentucky eyes.

STORM
Have a nuther drink.

WITT
Thank you, I will. It's good to see
you, Stormy. What are you doin’ up
here feeding all these strangers?

STORM
I tried to catch up to the comp'ny,
but we missed them. Couldn't go any

further -- and these guys was here.
I figured I might as well feed
somebody.

WITT

Well, I guess it's a good deed. It
was good for me, anyway. I been
hiking three days.

Storm looks around the ridge and shrugs again.

STORM
Angh, for two cents I'd go with
you.
175.

WITT
Come on along.

STORM
I don't know what these dumbasses
would do if they didn't have me
around to take care of them.

WITT
We'd have some fun.

STORM
The truth is, I don't like to get
shot at.

WITT
Ever body to his own taste. I thin
I like it. But honestly, I wouldn't
be doin’ this if it wasn't the old
comp’ny.

Storm looks at him skeptically but lets it pass, and Witt
sets out again, well aware of the effect his odyssey is
creating.

NEW ANGLES

Witt shakes Storm's hand a final time. He has lingered to
have a couple more drinks.

WITT

We're going to find out after this
war is over what we fought for, if
it was for freedom or so's a bunch
of people could get rich and ruin
the country and never call things
by their rightful names. Yessir!

(taking Storm by the

shoulder )
Like my Aunt Kay says, the fat hogs
have got loose in the creek and
tromped everything up. That's
what's happened.

(spitting)
We worked to build this country.
They stole what we built and messed
up what was there to begin with,
belonged to everybody. The big
companies have got control of our
work, our pay, our bank deposits
our public lands and our govment.
They've dug holes.

(MORE)
176.

We're dumb Wad Titepninidians. American
democracy's been bombed. We're
living in the ruins. Them that
comes after is going to have to be
content with what we spoiled.

(his voice grows thick)
You ever had a garden? They're
pulling up the young plants and
watering the weeds! People don't
see what's happening. They got ways
of keeping it secret. But I seen
it, easy as falling off a log. They
don't fool me. No, sir! I paid the
price, and I seen the show.

Who is closer to the truth -- Welsh, with his disillusioned
view of things (which Storm and, in varying degrees, the rest
of the company share) or Witt, with his idealism?

STORM
They fooled you plenty. What're you
going up there for? I can see doing
it because they make you. But ready
and willing!

Witt is not sure what Storm is driving at, or why suddenly he
has taken this new tone. A moment ago they were the best of
friends.

STORM
Company don't care about you.
Company's just a shell. A hotel.
People come and go. You going to
get shot at for a hotel? After
you're gone, they're going to have
other guests. You don't owe them
nothin’. You believe in somethin'
that don't believe in you.

Witt wonders if Storm is insulting him. He brought it on him-
self, though, didn't he? He won't make the same mistake
again.

WITT
I made a mistake getting into this
discussion.

He gives Storm back his jar of liquor, turns and walks off.

STORM
Boy, they're just playing you like
a fiddle in a band. You're just the
kind they like to get.
(as Witt continues on)
(MORE)
177.

They don't SGDRM(castti'td About you!
Don't even know that you exist.
They're going to eat you up and
have you for dinner.

(shouting after him)
Jackass! Briar! And fuck your Aunt
Kay!

WITT
c (te himself, spitting)
ook!

Witt goes off in solitary splendor toward the line. Storm
watches until he disappears from sight, then kissing his
wounded hand and laughing with delight, he does a little jig.
A long column of troops winds through the grassy field ahead
of Witt. Trucks, jeeps, a tank. He catches a ride on a truck.

EXT. JUNGLE (MOWBRAY/GUADALCANAL )- DAY

Witt is walking down a road through the jungle, humming to
himself, when he hears the SNAP of a spent bullet in leaves
overhead. He stops and looks up. There is the faint, angry
WHIRR of a second bullet. He looks up and down. He is quite
alone here, exposed and vulnerable.

EXT. JUNGLE (OTHER ANGLES) - DAY

He sees a group of flying foxes, stirring uneasily in their
roost. He sees a stranger fig, choking the life out of a tall
hardwood. The grass about him throbs with CRICKETS. He feels
the cold presence of fear, like someone standing behind him.
He could still turn back. His eyes glisten. Now MUSIC comes
in, like a call of summoning love.

Further up the road he encounters a Marine SNIPER.

EXT. COPRA PLANTATION - DAY

C-for-Charlie is camped by an abandoned copra plantation. A
sentry hears a rock HUM past him and, startled, FIRES off a
couple of wild rounds. He stops when he hears himself hailed
form the jungle in a strong Kentucky accent.

WITT
Charlie Comp'ny! Charlie Comp'ny!
Hold yore fahr! It's witt!
(with sly humor)
Acting P-F-C Witt! Of Cannon
Comp'ny!
178.

Fife looks up. Other heads snap around. They see it is indeed
Witt. He has trekked all the way up to the line to find them.
There is a great deal of backslapping, laughter and
handshaking. Everybody is overjoyed to see him, to know that
he would search them out like this just to be with them. They
show him their new mascot: a cuscus.

Welsh and Witt have a conversation here.

EXT. PLANTATION VERANDA - DAY

Fife goes up to Witt and smiles. Squinting his eyes and
putting his head a little to one side and grinning, he says:

FIFE
Hello, Witt. Or are you still not
speakin’ to me?

Witt grins back. He seems to sense some change he likes. They
are alone on the plantation's dusty veranda. Chairs and
tables surround them, with other vestiges of some domestic
life before the war: a home, destroyed.

WITT
No. I guess I'm talking to you now.

FIFE
Because if you're not, I thought we
might as well have it out right
here and now.

Fife grins. Witt nods, still grinning. Apparently he has
heard about Fife's new fighting prowess.

WITT
Well, we could do that. I still
think I could take you. But you got
a pretty good right hand from what
I hear. If you tagged me with that
right hand, you might could whup
me. Awys pervaded I couldn't keep
away from it, a course.

FIFE
There ain't really no need though --
(grinning)
-- now. Since you're talking to me.
Is there?
WITT

Not really.
179.

FIFE
What do you say we have a slug of
swipe instead?

They laugh and shake hands, friends again. Fife's eyes sting
with tears of gratitude.

WITT
Been a long time since we had a
talk -- hadn't it? What's the new
commander like?

EXT. COPRA PLANTATION - DAY

Witt looks at the other men, in the same ecstasy of loving
comradeship that he felt for Capt. Stein the afternoon of
their assault on the Japanese bivouac. The CAMERA, FOLLOWING
his gaze, lingers on them, admiring them one by one. Little
do they suspect how they are gathered in the Kentuckian's
heart -- even Welsh, who stares at him in a mixture of
amusement and scorn.

He listens as a young NEWCOMER dictates a letter to a friend.

NEWCOMER
She don't know I can't write, but
she knows I can't write good, so
throw in some mistakes.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. KENTUCKY FARMS AND FIELDS - DAY

Witt, in what must be vision, sees the farms and valleys of
Kentucky -- people are going about their work, raking hay and
putting it up in barns -- a land of peace and truth, bright
with an unearthly light.

A woman appears. Gracious, noble, she looks out on those
scenes, a smile on her lips. She might be some individual
whom Witt has known; his sister or mother. She is all that is
not strife or war or senseless death. She is peace, she is
hope.

SHARP CUT TO:

EXT COPRA PLANTATION - DAY

A Japanese mortar BURSTS overhead. Fife quakes with horror.
180.

VOICE
Not my legs! Not my legs!

DOLL
Check your ammo!

C-for-Charlie cringes under a fierce counterattack. The
Japanese heavy mortars are lobbing in treebursts, and there
is nowhere to hide. From time to time a man rises up to draw
a piece of coconut tree from his flesh; the fragments are
thrown down from above with the force of the shrapnel itself
and finally do more damage.

Animals rush through the trees and across the tangled bungle
floor, as though fleeing a fire. Cockatoos, lorikeets. The
afternoon air sparkles with shredded vegetation. This new
battle is fiercer, more horrible and confused than the first.
(To convey the men's heightened sense of fear we shift for a
brief while from 35mm to 65mm film stock.)

EXT. COPRA PLANTATION - DAY

Fife claws the ground. All the confidence has gone out of
him; he is right back where he started. It takes every ounce
of courage he can muster not to break and run, just to stick
it out. He can do it and he does, but it costs him more than
it does the others, like Doll or Bell. He has to work harder
at it. It seems he isn't what he thought he was. Courage will
never be a possession with him.

Doll orders his squad around. The inexperienced men flinch
and gasp at each BURST from the mortars.

DOLL
We clot it and it's here. There
ain’t a fucking thing we can do
about it... Lock and load!

Fife watches him, amazed. Since his experience at the bunker,
a new sense of paternal responsibility has blossomed in Doll.

EXT. COPRA PLANTATION - DAY

The company's sparrow-mouthed, long-nosed NEW LIEUTENANT
gives the phone back to Corporal Weld. Neither he nor anyone
else seems to have the least idea where the enemy is or what
is going or. Half a dozen men from another unit flee past
them, some without their helmets. They say nothing to C-for-
Charlie -- merely glance at them with great white eyes, and
pass on.
181.

NEW LIEUTENANT
Somebody -- the commander says
somebody needs to go up there --

Beyond the plantation a red clay road runs straight off
through the jungle. One or two men crane their heads to look
up it.

NEW LIEUTENANT
(wondering if they heard
him)
Somebody needs to go forward and
find out how close they are. We
need to block that road. Till they
can send more people up.

BELL
We need to get out of here, sir
Right now. Did you explain the
situation to him? Does he know
where we are? We're sittin’ ducks
out here.

The Lieutenant tries to get battalion HQ on the phone again,
but now the line is dead.

WELD
They cut the line.

NEW LIEUTENANT
(very shaken)
Volunteers. I need volunteers.

The men look at each other. Those who came forward before --
Doll, Dale, Queen, Bell -- lie paralyzed today.

Witt studies the deserted road ahead. He knows that whoever
goes up there is likely never to come back.

NEWCOMER (0.S.)
I'll go.

Witt turns. A NEWCOMER has spoken up, a green recruit like
Bead, a stranger to them all. Now Witt recognizes him as the
man he heard dictating the letter the night before. MUSIC
enters.

The stranger quakes all over, astonished at himself. witt
frowns. He turns and looks at the others. His brothers! Again
it comes to him; the hotly joyous, almost sexual enjoyment
and acceptance; the joy of not caring anymore.
182.

WITT
Sir, I've had more experience than
that man.

The others look in amazement as Witt crawls over to the
Lieutenant.

NEW LIEUTENANT
I haven't seen you around before.

WITT
I want you to know I think the
whole thing's a bad idea, though.
If they come through there in any
strength, Lootenant, they're going
to knock your roadblock to hell and
flinders even if we was a whole
platoon. We couldn't hold them. But
I want to go.

The Lieutenant shares the other men's astonishment.

NEW LIEUTENANT
You don't have to go, private. If
you don't want to. Others will
volunteer.

Besides the young stranger, no one else has; they all know
it. And Witt can still get out.

WITT
No -- I want to go, sir. If
somethin’ bad happens, I want to be
there so maybe I can help. Besides
nothin’ bad may happen at all.

COOMBS
I'll go with Witt, Lieutenant.

Coombs looks at Witt as though he thought this way they might
have a chance to talk. The long-nosed New Lieutenant nods.

NEW LIEUTENANT
You'll need another man.

He looks around. Again there are no volunteers. Fife has no
intention of sticking his neck out, but when Witt's glance
accidentally crosses his, he suddenly speaks up.

FIFE
I'll go.
183.

The words are out of his mouth before he knows it. Witt
frowns. (Cover Welsh’s reactions as well.)

NEW LIEUTENANT
Be careful, Witt.

WITT
Yes, sir.

Witt gets his orders. He listens, then goes off witha
cheerful air that the other men find incomprehensible. Coombs
follows, then Fife. None of them looks back

The young man who volunteered, when he understands the look
in the other men's eyes, is glad his offer was not accepted
and that he did not renew it, however embarrassing his
failure to do so might be. Nor does it trouble him that two
other men are going in his place.

EXT. DESERTED ROAD - DAY
The three volunteers make their way forward.

WITT
You never know when to keep your
mouth shut.

Witt studies the road ahead from the position they have taken
up alongside it. Fife trembles. He wants to weep, but he is
afraid to. Everything is going so fast, so far. For a moment
nothing happens. Then, ominously, the mortars fall silent.
Fife feels it again -- the cold, empty fear -- like a hollow,
a void, where his confidence once lay his pleasure in
himself. It makes him feel sick. And it stays with him.

Witt looks around. A NOISE in the undergrowth on their right
barely perceptible at first, gradually grows more distinct.

Coombs peers forward, alarmed by a FAINT CRY. Ignoring Fife,
he looks at Witt only. Witt says nothing.

Coombs raises his head again. The concussion of a late mortar
round sends him reeling.

All at once, fifty yards ahead of them, they see a whole
battalion of Japanese soldiers materialize from the tree
line.
184.

Hundreds of fresh troops appear, camouflaged with the
branches of trees and bushes -- nothing like the gaunt,
starving, poorly-equipped figures C-for-Charlie has
encountered prior to now. The American soldiers look more
emaciated than the Japanese do.

Witt sees they have no chance of getting back together. Calm
and with a curious air of concentration, he turns to Fife.

WITT
Go back. Tell them what we saw. Say
they're coming up right behind the
mortars. Battalion strength.

FIFE
Why me? Let's both go.

Witt thinks about it for a moment. The Japanese advance
quickly, silently; this will be a surprise attack.

WITT
There's no time. You go. Tell that
new lieutenant to get everybody
back. Tell him they got heavy
machine guns. Tell him, where he's
sittin’ right now, they'll eat him
up. I'll hold them off.

Witt nods. There is still the same odd, cheerful air about
him. Fife gives him a little salute, and then he leaves.

Coombs is dying, and he knows it. He turns to Witt.

COOMBS
Geez, I never felt like this before
at all. What you guess it could be
from, like this? No bullets, no
blood. Just around my chest it's so
hard to breathe. Hold me, would
you. Let me look at you? Till the
end? Till it's over?

As Witt watches the Japanese approach, he begins to hear the
same MUSIC which came to him on the road as he was headed up
to the line; the same mysterious summons of fraternal
devotion. This is the fulfillment he has prepared himself
for.

EXT. COPRA PLANTATION - DAY

Fife runs like a desperate man, breaking a way through the
branches with his rifle, until he reaches the company.
185.

FIFE
Go back! Get back! Quick!

EXT. DESERTED ROAD - DAY

Witt waits until the Japanese are practically on top of him
before he OPENS FIRE. They are caught by surprise. Clearly
they had not expected to meet resistance so soon. A small
Japanese soldier with a .31 Caliber machine gun strapped to
his back advances toward him. He cannot reach back and fire
the gun himself; his job is merely to serve as a tripod for
it. Seeing Witt, he throws himself on the ground and digs in
like a badger. Other Japanese soldiers dash forward to
squeeze the trigger. One by one Witt shoots them down;
quickly, decisively, with daring and skill. Soon mortar
rounds begin to fall among the enemy soldiers. He looks back
over his shoulder. Perhaps Fife has reported their position;
perhaps the Japanese will stop and he'll get out of this.

EXT. COPRA PLANTATION - DAY

Several hundred yards away the men of C-for-Charlie listen in
bewilderment as they pull back.

MEN OF C-FOR-CHARLIE
Why don't he come back? Where's
Coombs? I just hear one gun. What's
happening? Why can't we go back?
Why can't we help him?

They glance at the new man, whose life has been spared.

WELD
The line's fixed, sir.

NEW LIEUTENANT
(shouting into the phone)
Fire mission. Grid Five Mike One
Niner. Enemy in the open. Danger
close.

Welsh is the last to fall back. He looks in Witt's direction.
WELSH
Fool!
EXT. DESERTED ROAD - DAY

Witt darts up and down the Japanese line of advance, FIRING
until he runs out of ammunition.
186.

While he is reloading a YOUNG JAPANESE, almost a boy, runs
forward and grasps the machine gun's trigger. The man who is
flattened beneath it rises from the ground, twitching his
shoulders left and right to make the fire traverse.

Witt dodges through the trees. The BULLETS shriek and hum as
they pass. From time to time he drops to the ground, hiding,
cunning and crafty, like a jungle animal.

The human tripod vats up and follows him quickly, with the
triggerman close behind.

YOUNG JAPANESE
Slendull! Slendull, soju!

Witt does not move. To give your life gladly! To lay down
your life for your friends!

The Japanese soldiers come up, surrounding him. There is no
chance he can escape now. When they are nearly on top of him
he lunges out at them, and they SHOOT him down.

EXT. COPRA PLANTATION - DAY

Fife listens, numb with terror, as American artillery rounds
SCREAM overhead. His grimy face is streaked with tears.
Before him on the ground lies a perfect seashell.

EXT. DESERTED ROAD - DAY

An abrupt silence announces that the battle is over. Witt
lies beside a Japanese soldier.

MEN OF C-FOR-CHARLIE (0.S.)
He might of got away. Look over
there.

They draw closer to Witt's body.

EXT. DESERTED ROAD - DAY

Fife, Bell, Welsh, Queen and Doll are gathered under the
spell of their comrade's death. Fife feels tie with them all.
Even with Charlie Dale. Even with the slain Japanese who lie
here and there like shoeless, sleeping children. It is as
though he had died himself and were watching the scene like a
ghost, from the other side.

FIFE
You're not alone. Can you hear me?
187.

He sits with his friend and holds his hand and does not utter
another word. He looks intently into the dead face. At last
he puts Witt's hand down and walks away, alone.

EXT. DESERTED ROAD - DAY
Now Welsh is standing over the dead man.

WELSH
Where's your pride now?
(he turns to a medic)
Bury that soldier.

EXT. WITT'S GRAVE - DAY

Witt is buried at the edge of the straight red road. They dam
his rifle in the ground, set his helmet on it and tie a
dogtag to the triggerguard. Fife's terror passes gradually
over into a longing for life and peace. The sun gleams
through the trees overhead, through the wild bananas and huge
looping lianas.

EXT. JUNGLE - DAY

Fife is walking to morning chow with Bell when he turns his
ankle on a half-dried rut in the road and goes down with a
thud.

BELL
You all right?

He has to hop along to take the weight off the inured ankle,
resting his hand from time to time on Bell s shoulder. The
pain is exquisite. MacTae, the supply sergeant, comes up.

MACTAE
You're white as a sheet! What the
hell happened to you there?

FIFE
I stepped on it wrong.

MACTAE
You been to the medics with it? No?
Really? You're out of your
everlovin’ mind! You can get
evacuated on that.

(excitedly)

I know guys w yo got shipped out on
a lot less than that.

(MORE)
188.

Let the do@ACGHE (ontshdw it to
them up at Division.

FIFE
What if they turn me down?

MACTAE
What have you got to lose? You
won't be any worse off than you are
now, will you?

But Fife feels there is something else, a serious moral
problem.

MACTAE
Are you kidding? Man, if I had
somethin' like that, I'd be up
there like a shot! Trouble with me,
I'm so fucking healthy I ain't
never gonna get myself shipped out!

Fife looks at Bell. He seems to want one of them to tell him
that he should stay, but they cannot think of a reason to.

MACTAE
I wouldn't hesitate a second... If
it's as bad as what I just saw, it
could get you out of here. If it's
as bad as what I saw, you got no
business in the infantry.

EXT. COMPANY AREA - DAY

A detachment of Japanese prisoners is passing by when
suddenly Queen steps out in front of them. The guards look at
one another, uncertain what they should do. None is bold
enough to challenge the huge veteran.

Queen stares into the face of one of the prisoners, a man
half his size. The Japanese is dazed and exhausted. He looks
out at
(Page 178 of the original missing)
FIFE
Well, if it will help it, sir -- I
guess I am.

Haines shrugs, and again his eyes glint. He turns to the
orderly.

Doc HAINES
Admit this man for evacuation.
189.

Fife is afraid to believe it, lest something happen to change
it. Just like that. Just like that, and he is out. Out! Out!
Why does he suddenly feel so guilty, so alone?

The evacuation order is si calls and stamped. As he is going
out the flap Doc Haines calls out to him.

Doc HAINES
You're a sergeant now, I see. You
were a corporal before, weren't
you?

Fife nods.

EXT. EXAMINING TENT - DAY

Outside the tent Bell slaps him on the back. Fife tries to
look joyful -- Bell seems to expect it -- but somehow he
cannot. Things are going so fast. Already a new destiny is
upon him.

EXT. SUPPLY AREA - DAY

Fife and Bell sit on a packing crate in a supply area.

BELL
How can you even think twice about
it?

FIFE

I got my squad. They depend on me.
I don't want to let them down. They
never let me down.

BELL
They'd all tell you to go. They'd
tell you to get as far from this
Rock as you possibly could. what do
you want to stay for? Everybody's
using every loophole they can think
of. You've got it made. Get out.

FIFE
This is the first time in my life I
ever belonged to something -- where

I had a place, a real job.

Bell nods. MUSIC enters.
190.

BELL
You think you’re going to keep up
with each other, but after a while
you don't. Maybe you get a
Christmas card now and then. After
a while it stops.

Faintly and far away, the KLAXONS start up, signalling the
approach of the evening air raid. Neither of them gives any
thought to seeking cover, or even looks up.

FIFE

I was afraid up there. It was as
bad as ever. I was lying there and
those treebursts were coming in --
I thought I wasn't going to get up.
I thought they were going to have
to send the MPs after me.

(looking off)
I thought I'd licked it. Once and
for all. That I wouldn't be afraid
n more. It's going to keep coming
back. I'm going to have to fight it
every day of my life.

(after a pause)
I don't want to run from a fight.
Only thing, I still want to have a
wife and kids... Witt was my best
friend.

BELL
You make other friends.

Fife feels a sudden love of home, a greed for life and
deliverance. He does not want to go back broken and burned
out. He loves the Army. But he hates it too -- the corrupt
ignorant, monotonous rut that everybody is in, the
indignities they all must suffer -- the sick green horror of
war most of all.

FIFE
If I go back I'm finished. I'll go
over the hill or go crazy, one.

BELL
Maybe you're not a soldier.

Bell looks at Fife and smiles.
191.

EXT. SHORE - DAY

Fife walks along the shore, alone. Crabs scuttle back and
forth on the seething wet sand. He sees the broken shells,
the wavy lines of wrack, a germinating coconut. Is life like
the sea, brutal and relentless? Does it know, or care, whom
it smashes on the rocks?

EXT. HQ AREA (MAIL CALL)- DAY

At mail call Bell gets the letter he has been waiting for
from his wife. They have just broken off for noon chow, and
Corporal Weld has come around with a batch of new mail. When
he opens it and sees how it begins, he knows what it is. She
has been doing it. She's been doing it. He feels sick all
over. His legs are shaky and his hands and arms are shaky. He
sits down on a coco palm log.

Doll sees him and comes to his side. MUSIC enters.

BELL

She wants a divorce. To marry him.
She says she's fallen in love and
she wants that love while she can
have it. She's asking my
forgiveness.

(tapping the letter)
It's all so calm and proper. You
could show it to your mother.

(after a silence)
She says it like she was going out
to buy a new dress!

Trucks of new replacements are coming in. The green men study
the veterans of C-for-Charlie with open-mouthed awe.

INT. HQ TENT - DAY

Bell has come with the letter to CAPTAIN BOSCHE, the new
company commander. They are alone. The reaction he gets from
Bosche is astonishing, even to him in his state of despair
As he reads, the Captain's hands begin to shake until the
letter rattles. His face becomes as white as a sheet of his
own memo paper with a rage so great that it seems to bunch
his hard round little face into a tight little ball. Somehow
Bosche gets command of himself again.

CAPT. BOSCHE
You know, of course, that you do
not have to accede to this request.
(MORE)
192.

Your wife €ayPTt. RASCHEiGerted dr
separation without your official
permission.

(as Bell nods)
Something else. With a letter like
this in your possession, you have
the right to stop all allotments
all payments, all government
insurance policies.

BELL
(tiredly)
I want to give it to her. I wanted
to ask you if you'd draft an
official letter from you for me,
giving her the permission.

CAPT. BOSCHE
I don't understand. Why do you want
to do that?

BELL
Well, I guess it's just that what's
the point of being married to a
woman who doesn't want to be
married to you?

Captain Bosche's eyes have narrowed to slits, and with them
he stares at Bell profoundly.

CAPT. BOSCHE
Well, there are all sort of
attitudes and opinions, I guess.
That's what makes the world go
round. You've got nothing to be
ashamed of.

BELL
Will you draft the letter for me,
sir?

CAPT. BOSCHE
I certainly will.

Bell turns to go.

CAPT. BOSCHE
Oh, Bell!
(holding out a sheaf of
papers)
This came in yesterday, for you. I
held it up a little because I
wanted to write my own endorsement.
(MORE)
193.
I just thoGAPd .ciBOSGHRY adightdbe' a

good time to give it to you. It's
an order for a field commission
appointing you a First Lieutenant
of Infantry.

BELL
Really?

CAPT. BOSCHE
Really. I assumed that you would
want to accept it. I've already
written my endorsement.

BELL
Can I think it over?

CAPT. BOSCHE
Of course. Take all the time you
want. You've had several big things
today. And if you want to change
your mind about that other matter
that will be all right, too... Be
strong.

BELL
Thank you, sir.

EXT. HQ TENT - DAY
Outside the tent, Bell has given Doll the news.

DOLL
If you take it, they'll post you
somewhere else. No telling where
you'll end up.

Bell gone? Bell too? Doll feels alone and afraid.

BELL
Means more money. The comp’ny’s not
the same any more. All these new
men, half of them I don't know
their names. S’not the outfit that
landed on this island. Feels all
different. I mean, Dale, an ex-
cook! Platoon Sergeant?

DOLL
Yeah. Thorne said he was coming
back. He never did.
194.

EXT. HQ AREA - DAY

His duffel bag packed, Bell stands watching a Melanesian
woman. The next day he will be sworn in and transferred.
Storm, it turns out, is leaving with him. He is glad to get
out alive, and not the least bit guilty. As the jeep pulls
away, Welsh sends him a salute.

Doll sits alone at the other end of the bivouac. Bell has
given him an address on a scrap of paper, but who knows if
they will ever see each other again or whether anything will
be the same after this war? He looks around at the new,
unfamiliar faces. Will this be his fate, to watch his friends
leave him one by one?

EXT. EVACUATION HOSPITAL - DAY

Welsh stands outside the hospital. He looks at the ground a
moment, then flips his cigarette away and goes inside

INT. EVACUATION HOSPITAL - DAY

Welsh sees Fife and wanders over to his bed.

FIFE
What’re you doing here, First?

WELSH
I had to bring somebody his gear.
So you're finally makin' it out,

hunh, kid?
FIFE
Yeah.
WELSH
When's the ship leave?
FIFE
Three days.
WELSH
You're smart. Get out while there's
still time.
FIFE

You know, First. I been thinkin’.
Maybe I ought to stay.
195.

WELSH
You what?

FIFE
Well, yes. I mean, you know, I'm
gonna miss the comp’ny. And it's --
it's sort of like running out. In
one way.

Fife does not want to leave this island a coward or a sneak.
He expected to be admired for it; instead Welsh leers at him
in silence, his mad eyes gleaming.

WELSH
Sure, kid, I think if you feel like
that, you oughta come back.

FIFE
You think so? I thought I might
slip out of here tonight maybe.

WELSH

You should.

(then grinning his slow,

sly grin)
You want to know why I busted you --
out of the orderly room? You
thought it was because we thought
you weren't coming back, didn't
you? Well, it wasn't. It was
because you were such a lousy
fucking bad clerk, I HAD to do it!

If he could, Fife would hit him, he is so furious. He knows
he wasn't a bad clerk. But he is lying on his back and before
he can get up Welsh is gone, down the aisle and out through
the flap.

FIFE
You fucking bastard! You're sick!
You feel sorry for yourself!
Bastard!

The orderlies rush down the aisle to calm him. Silently,
struggling not to, Fife weeps tears of rage and desperation.

EXT. AIRFIELD (DRUMSARA) - DUSK

MUSIC enters as three days later Fife boards a cargo plane.
No one from the company is present to see him off; they are
all far away, on the other side of the island. He bobs like a
cork in a sea of men he does not know.
196.

EXT. AIRFIELD (DAINTREE) - DAY
Captain Bosche addresses the assembled company.

CAPT. BOSCHE

Now I know you men are making and
drinking this goddamn swipe. That's
okay by me. Any man in an outfit of
mine can get as drunk as he wants
to every night, as long as he's
ready -- and in shape -- to make
reveille and carry out any
assignment he's given. If he can't
do that, he's gonna have trouble,
and from me. Personal.

(a pause)
Now I prefer to think of myself as
a family man. And that's what we
all are here, whether we like it
or not. A family. I'm the father
and -- I guess that makes Sergeant
Welsh here the mother.

(there is some laughter)
And whether you guys like it or
not, that makes all of you the
children in this family. Now a
family can only have one head, and
that's the father. Me. Father's
the head, and mother runs it.
That's the way it's gonna be here.
If any of you guys want to see me
about anything, anything at all,
you'll find I m available. On the
other hand, I'm gonna be busy
makin’ a living for this family, so
if it's not important, maybe mother
can handle it. That's all, except
for one more thing. We're into
training now, as all of you know.
You all know what kind of training
it is, too. Well, I'm making this
training just as tough on everybody
as I possibly can. Including me. So
expect it. Now that's all -- Except
one more thing. It'll be a long
time before we get home. The war is
not going to be over by next
Christmas. We'll probably have to
circle the world, and you 11
probably go back by way of New
York. So let's stick together.

(MORE)

 
197.

I want you CAP Tkn®OSGHH(a@entlbdy as
you guys back me up, I'll back you
up. All the way, and with anybody.
With any outfit, and any army.
Japanese, American, or what have
you. You can count on that
(pausing again)
And now that's really all!

The tough little guy has not smiled once, even at his own
jokes. Everybody likes him. Even Welsh seems to like him.

EXT. HQ AREA - DAY

A week later Sgt. Welsh stands in front of the company,
wearing a full field pack.

A YOUNG LIEUTENANT
Sergeant Welsh, our scheduled
transportation has been delayed.
The trucks were diverted to another
unit. What do you suggest we do?

WELSH
We'll go out the way we came, sir.

The lieutenant nods, and they exchange a salute. Welsh turns
to face the men, standing in ranks next to their equipment.

VOICES
First platoon, all present and
accounted for... Second platoon,
all present and accounted for...
Etc.

WELSH
All right -- move! Move!

EXT. ROAD TO BEACH - DAY

The men of C-for-Charlie march to the beach -- past a herd of
cattle, past a Melanesian woman who gazes at them from beside
a stream. Another company goes by, headed up toward the line.
Stalks of red ginger glow amid the strangler figs and vines.
Outside a leaf chapel, a group of Melanesians are singing.
The stream where Dale stooped to drink the bloody water flows
clear again. Some suggestion that in time the earth will
cleanse itself.
198.

EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

Their route leads them past the new cemetery. Plodding along,
gasping in the airless humidity, the cemetery looks very
green and cool to them. The area has been well drained, and
blue-grass has been planted on it. Quartermaster men move
here and there, keeping it up and tending it. Big sprinklers
send their long gossamer jets swirling through the air above
the crosses. Already grass rises from the grave mounds.

EXT. BEACH (WANGETTI) LCIs - DAY

They arrive at the beach. LCIs ply the waters between the
beach and the big ships that wait offshore to receive them.
Melanesian stevedores work among the stacks of crates. A
sailor standing on an oil drum, signalling the ships with
semaphore flags.

THE END
