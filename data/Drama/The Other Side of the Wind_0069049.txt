ANOTHER PHOTO OF

THE WRECK...

THEN A SERIES OF
FLASH PICTURES MADE
AT THE BIRTHDAY PARTY

O.W.’S VOICE
(on the sound-track)

That’s the car...

What was left of it after the accident
-.. If it was an accident.

The car was meant to be a present.
Before he changed his mind, Hannaford
Was going to give it to the young
Leading actor of his last movie --

John Dale.
Hannaford’s supposed to have saved
Him -- at some earlier date -- from

Committing suicide.

Or so the story goes.
A SERIES OF FLASH
PICTURES OF GUESTS
AT THE BIRTHDAY
PARTY ...

A FLASH PICTURE
OF HANNAFORD

A “STILL” FROM
HANNAFORD’S FILM

W.’S VOICE
(contd. )

Most of Hannaford’s admirers are
Certain he did not intend to drive
His car off that bridge

“A corny ending,” they say, “J.J.
Hannaford would never be guilty
Of that.”

There are other opinions...

He died last summer on his birthday,
July second -- it’s much too early
To guess what history will decide
About him...

This was put together from many
Sources -- from all that footage
Shot by the TV and documentary
Film-makers -- and also the students,
Critics and young directors who
Happened to bring sixteen and eight
Millimeter cameras to his birthday
Party ...

The choice of the material is an
Attempt to sketch a film likeness
Through all those different
Viewfinders ...
THE FILM BEGINS

W.’S VOICE

Hannaford’s own unfinished motion
Picture is part of the testimony:

“The Other Side Of The Wind” ...
It has been left just as it was

When they screened it -- on the
Last day of his life.
NOTE:

JAKE HANNAFORD’S film which runs in
counterpoint to this is not here
Described.

The first scene (the Turkish Bath
Sequence) opens the picture and plays
Under the titles.
THE DIRECTOR'S VOICE
Suddenly brings the scene
To an end:

JAKE

Ohh----kay...
Cut!

WE ARE ON THE SOUND STAGE OF A MOVIE STUDIO

FIRST ASSISTANT DIRECTOR

This is a wrap, Mister Hannaford?

JAKE

Yes, Kid.

FIRST ASSISTANT (PAT)
(full voice in the
background overlapping
the following)

Okay, everybody! Back-lot,
Monday morning, remember --
Nine o'clock.

THE GIRLS put on
dressing gowns, GRIPS
move equipment; everybody
starts out through the
big main doors ...

HIGGAM
(a party guest and author
of books on the cinema)

Mr. Hannaford--
BUT J.J. HANNAFORD is
moving off toward the
door in the dark rear
of the sound stage...

A sun-gun flashes on to
reveal a line of DWARVES
lined up shoulder to
shoulder for inspection.
HANNAFORD passes them
without comment.

HIGGAM (contd. )
Mister Hannaford ...

Various DOCUMENTARY
CAMERA ARE FOLLOWING
the regular movie crew
out the main doors of
the sound stage. Also
Journalists and many
“STILL” PHOTOGRAPHERS

MATT
(to a SECOND ASSISTANT
indicating the whole
boiling mass)

Who let them in?

THE ASSISTANT TURNS
to MAGGIE, appealing
for answer.

MAGGIE

They’re the “Close-Up on Hannaford”

He is looking up at a bus ...
Sixteen seats are occupied by
sixteen gruesomely realistic

dummies -- exact duplicates of
JOHN DALE (the actor who -- up
to now -- has been playing the

leading male role in HANNAFORD’S
FILM)

HIGGAM (0.S.)

He promised me--
ZIMMER (0.S.)

He asked for them.
AL (0.S.)

He thinks they’re louzy.
ZIMMER (0.S.)

So why does he want ‘em all out
at the ranch?

HIGGAM
(as though this explained
everything):
I’m Higgam.
THE BARON:

Of course you are.
FRESH ANGLE:

REVERSE ANGLE:

HIGGAM
I’m doing the book on Mister

Hannaford.

THE BARON
(to MAGGIE, with
carefully muted
sarcasm)
And I know somebody, somewhere who
isn’t.

JULIE RICH
(entering scene)

Mine is the authorized biography ...

THE BARON
(making introductions)

It is certainly one of them, Miss Rich
-- Miss Maggie Fassbinder,
Miss Julliette Rich.
JULIE RICH
Call me Julie --

MAGGIE’S VOICE (0.S.)

Hi, Julie --

MATT (a super stooge in

the Hannaford Mafia)
continues with the
introductions:

MATT

This is Mister Pister -- the first
name is Charles.
MUSIC strikes up ...

a small brass band (0.

New Orleans style and

PISTER

MATT
Isn’t it -- ?

MAGGIE

can agree to this)

And this is Matt Costello,
Mr. Hannaford’s personal assistant--

MATT
Yeach, I do all the dirty jobs--

(turning to ZIMMER, the
make-up man)

Which reminds me ...
ZIMMER

You gotta give me hell, so go ahead --
I’m sittin’ down for it.

PAT
You're a brave man, Zimmie.
ZIMMER

Brave? I got flat feet.

MATT

Ah, go sit in the bus -- you and
your dummies...

HIGGAM rushes off-

FRESH ANGLE:

HIGGAM

I was promised a place in
Mister Hannaford’s car --

PAT
Start running, junior, you just

might catch up with him at the
gate.

MAGGIE

Right Zimmie: you can all be
brave together at the ranch.

MATT
Where’s the Baron?

THE BARON
(sardonically)

Here, sir.
MATT

What'd you do with Max David?
12

THE BARON
Billy's taking care of him.
MATT

Billy? What’s he know about
the story--?

THE BARON
(sketching a
shrug)

According to Jake it doesn’t
matter-- He’s more Max’s style...

MATT

They’re in the projection room--?
THE BARON

I think he’s right--
MATT

Jake? Of course, he’s right--
THE BARON

Isn’t he always--? ... Do I get to
ride with the nudes?

MATT

You go with the midgets.

THE STUDIO PROJECTION ROOM

 

MAX DAVID, the latest (and who knows?, maybe the last)

big chief of one of the last of the big movie companies,
stands in front of the blank screen, looking impatiently at
his watch ...
13

BILLY BOYLE (a super-stooge in the HANNAFORD MAFIA)
hurries up to him.

BILLY

Hi, Max -- remember me, I’m
Billy Boyle.

MAX DAVID
Oh, yes, hi. Billy, where’s your
boss?

BILLY

(gamely trying to hide
his distress)

Jake... Maybe we'd better not wait
for him...

MAX DAVID
He’s still on the set?
BILLY

I don’t know where he is, Max --
just at the moment...

a success -- who remembers what
it cost?

REVERSE ANGLE:

MATT
(climbing into the bus)

Zimmer... I got to give you
a message.

ZIMMER
(after a beat)

From Jake? I got that message.
Everybody heard.

MATT
Not this message.

Pause... Not a move,
not a blink from MATT.

ZIMMER
I’m fired. That’s the message.

MATT’S continued
immobility supplies
the answer
INTERCUT WITH:
JULIE RICH and her own camera
and sound men. Also a couple of
lesser fish in the world of
European journalism.

ZIMMER (contd. )

So what am I doing going to his
party?
15

MATT
You're invited.
ZIMMER
... With all these stupid dummies -- !
MATT
They're invited.
ZIMMER
Jokes...
MAGGIE
You know how he is sometimes.
ZIMMER
I know how he’s getting...
JULIE RICH pricks up her
ears at this, and signals

to her cameraman. MATT
catches her at it.

CUT TO:

SERIES OF SHOTS:

The bus rolling on along the
freeway... Aboard there is

yet another DOCUMENTARY CAMERA
CREW, but most of the passengers
are ZIMMER’S SUPERNUMERARY
DUMMIES. One of these last is
propped up in a seat beside
ZIMMER himself. Matt, PAT

and MAGGIE are nearby... AL

is with MISS RICH.
16

INTERCUT: ANOTHER BUS

A much livelier scene including
the midgets and the girls (the
nudes from the steambath)

MATT

So here you are in Hollywood,
Julie... I bet life was never
like this in -- what was that
little hick town you were born

in -- ? Dijon, France --
JULIE RICH
(very cool)
Oh...?
MATT

Yeah, I just remembered. You
aren’t French, though -- you’re
Polak extraction.

JULIE RICH
(coldly)

You seem to know quite a lot about
me, Mr. Kelly.

MATT
(giving her the old
smile)

Call me Matt.

ZIMMER
(in a tone of weary
bitterness)
Old Matt -- he knows just about

everybody. He’s on that Committee --
17

MATT
Pipe down, Zimmie.
ZIMMER

The one that decides if you’re
American.

JULIE RICH
I’m not American...
ZIMMER

Maybe you didn’t know these
people are still in business.

MATT
(a whiff of quiet
menace )
We’re in business, Zimmie.
JULIE RICH
Mr. Hannaford’s investigated me?
AL
Well, not Jake exactly...

MATT
(the phone to his ear)

No -- he isn’t on our Committee --

The bus starts with a
jerk, shaking everybody --

AL

We gotta be a little careful,
don’t we?

MATT
(to Mlle. RICH)

That’s all right, Julie...
You don’t have to worry.
You're clean.

ROOM

BILLY

--. No editing, really -- just the
slates cut off...

MAX DAVID

So what am I going to see --

everything he’s shot up to now?
BILLY

The first couple reels, Max. The
rest’s already out at the ranch...
Zarah’s giving him this party, and
she invited all these movie freaks...

Bleak, blank silence from

MAX DAVID.

He waits again for

some sort of reaction,

and once again gets
nothing.

We'll see the rest of us the stuff
when we get there...
19

BILLY (cont) (contd. )
Zarah’s expecting you, Max...
So is Jake --

MAX DAVID

I was expecting him here.

CUT TO:

JAKE'S CAR (RACING THROUGH THE STREETS)

 

Jammed into the back are the two cinema historians

And biographers, HIGGAM and PISTER, also a DOCUMENTARY
CREW (sound and camera)... They can see J.J. HANNAFORD

in the driver’s mirror; he’s wearing sunglasses...

Sitting beside him is his comrade and disciple, the highly
successful young film director BROOKS OTTERLAKE. (OTTER-
LAKE is also a talented and compulsive impressionist.

With JAKE particularly -- with whom he is now, secretly,
more than a bit uneasy -- he tends to jump from one “Voice”
to another.) Another CAMERAMAN IS SQUEEZED next to him.

In the back seat:

A flurry of hushed haggling between HIGGAM and PISTER, and
a perfect frenzy of interviews... PISTER wants to know,
among other things, if MR. HANNAFORD considers that “the
camera is a phallus?”

Maybe JAKE doesn’t hear...
20

JAKE
Brooksie --
OTTERLAKE
Right here at your side, Skipper.
JAKE
Know what I want for my birthday?
OTTERLAKE
(indicating the
cineastes in the back)
Not this, I bet --
JAKE
I want a drink.
THE SOUND MAN
Mr. Hannaford... Do you mind
driving a little slower?
FRESH ANGLE: THE SOUND MAN
Sprawled dangerously on the back
of the car, clutching his
microphone.
THE SOUND MAN (contd. )

I’m afraid I'll fall off...

THE BUS WITH THE DUMMIES

 

MAGGIE’S VOICE (0.S.)

Aw, come on, Zimmie. Jake’s fine.
He’s just like he always
was.

ZIMMER

(I’m a make-up man)... an expert.
All my life I’ve been sticking my nose
into other people’s wrinkles. I know
the little signs.

(after a beat)

It's something you could almost...
smell.

That’s what the gypsies say.

MAGGIE
(dismissing foolishness)
Gypsies...
ZIMMER
Nine months we practically lived
with them... Jake’s first picture
in Spain.
A flamenco guitar is
strumming... but gloom

hangs heavy over the
group of HANNAFORD

executives seated among

the dummies...

“The Other Side Of The Wind”...

(IN THE STUDIO PROJECTION ROOM)

BILLY, sitting beside MAX DAVID,
is doing his best to act as
interpreter, salesman and

apologist.

BILLY
This is toward to the beginning...
It comes right after what we
were shooting today...
She leaves the steamroom, and
here’s this character waiting for
her...

MAX DAVID

Dale something?

BILLY
John Dale, Max...
He’s the kid on the motorcycle.
The one in the middle...
Silence...

THE FILM continues...

then CUT TO:

THE BUS

 

PAT
(defensively)

Aw, he’s picked ‘em before...

MAGGIE
(after a beat)

Nobody knows that better than
Zimmie... Nobody’s been with
him any longer.

ZIMMER

Well, I was never a member of
the old wolf-pack. If you’re
Jewish, to get into that club,
you gotta be charming...

MATT
You’re charming enough, Zimmie --

(turning back in his
seat)
ZIMMER sighs...
She reacts to this.

24

MATT (contd. )
You’re just sore about the dummies.
AL'S VOICE (0.S.)

I know how he feels. Zimmie put in
a lot of good work for him...

ZIMMER
The bridge for Randy Leigh's nose.
I created that nose: the famous
profile -- it made him a star.
PAT
Jake made him a star...

MAGGIE

He doesn’t need to make stars --
just movies.

MAGGIE (contd.)
You don’t think so?

ZIMMER
(looking at the dummy)

I don’t know what I think of this
one --

PAT
(under his breath)

Who does?
CU: THE DUMMY HEAD...

CUT TO:

25

THE FILM (IN THE STUDIO PROJECTION ROOM)

(shots featuring JOHN DALE)...

BILLY can’t think

of an answer to this.

MAX DAVID
(after watching in
silence for a
while)

He looks like a girl.

BILLY
They do nowadays, that’s how they
want to look -- It’s the scene,
Max...

MAX DAVID

Which scene?
BILLY
The scene...
MAX DAVID
(sarcastic, but not

pressing hard)

Oh?... And you old guys | are trying
to... ‘get with it’ -- ?

Is that what this movie’s about?

(then after a beat)
CUT TO:

JAKE'S CAR

He switches on the
playback of his

MAX DAVID (contd. )

No?... Well, just what is it
about?

BILLY

I’‘ll try to explain, Max --
as we go along...

OTTERLAKE
(to HIGGAM and
PISTER
All right, men -- let’s get
organized... Where shall we
start -- where old Dad here

ran away to sea? Or way back
to the ancestors?

(change of voice--
as a cinema freak)

They were all actors, weren’t they,
Mr. Hannaford?

(change of voice)
Worse than that -- they were Irishmen.

Here’s the original -- not that
it’s as good...

A whirring sound and
the tape recorder
falls silent...

During this last he
changes cartridges
in his tape recorder.

27

JAKE'S VOICE
(playback)

Most of the old actor-managers
were micks. Barret, McCullough,
Hannaford, O’Neil... What

else was there to be? You
carried bricks, got into politics
or went on the stage. Old Junius
Hannaford was pretty big in High
Tragedy before the Civil War.

And Junius Junior as befits the
second generation, made it into
High Society -- a pioneer snob
blazing the trail for the Kellys
and the Kennedys...

OTTERLAKE
That’s a run-out; but I know the
rest. Mr. Hannaford’s father
went into the movies --

HIGGAM

“Mayfair Max -- “”

OTTERLAKE
“Gentleman Jewel Thief” -- right!
Y’see, Skipper -- everybody knows
everything.

He made three of those pictures...
28

He turns on the playback.

OTTERLAKE has flicked
off the little sound
machine... JAKE
glances at him
sardonically.

CUT TO:

THE STUDIO PROJECITON

THE FILM continues...

JAKE'S VOICE
(on playback)

.-.. And everybody was happy
till they found him one
Sunday morning in his suite
in the old Hollywood Hotel
hanging from the chadel --

Censorship?
OTTERLAKE
(doesn’t reply to the
question, but returns, a
bit defensively, to his
former breezy style)

After that you had to go to
work for a living --

(to those in the back seat)

Give the Skipper his hooch, will you --

ROOM
A brief silence.

CUT TO:

29

BILLY

According to Jake, the box likes
him...

MAX DAVID
(an indifferent
mumble)
Box?
BILLY

The old magic box. If the camera
doesn’t like an actor, it just
stares...
(another beat)
That’s what Jake says.
MAX DAVID
And if the actor doesn’t like the old
magic director?...
BILLY
(vaguely)
Yeah...
MAX DAVID

And the girl?
(then, after a beat)

How does the box feel about her?

THE ACTRESS HERSELF (DRIVING HER OWN CAR)

Like everyone else, on her
way to the birthday party...
30

contd...

She comes to a stop next to
JAKE'S car: they’re both
waiting for a traffic light.

OTTERLAKE
(aside to JERRY)

Pocohontas...
(A bit of rather stoogish
laughter greets this from
the back seat)
OTTERLAKE (contd. )
Zarah was gonna invite your
man, too... We put a stop to that,
I reckon --

JAKE
(blankly)

Nobody can find him.
OTTERLAKE turns to look
at him... the lights
change, JAKE guns the
car and it leaps forward

behind)

chuckle)

A red, red Indian --

You'll meet her out

Perhaps you’d care to assess the

trauma of your

father’s suicide as it

may have been reflected in your films?
32

PISTER (contd. )

(getting ready to
repeat his question)

Mr. Hannaford --
OTTERLAKE

(briskly changing
voices -- some
celebrated and
ridiculously inap-
propriate character)

Mr. Hannaford began his career as a
prop an in the old cliff-hangers...
Bombs, buzz-saws, pits full of deadly
serpents -- he provided all the
disasters --
PISTER (0.S.)

Mumbles...

HIGGAM (0.S.)

What?... Of course, it was
Hollywood --

JAKE
(half to himself)

Another town of the same name...
OTTERLAKE
(after a brief pause,

prompting him)

Yeah -- ?
Another tiny pause.

INTERCUT:

33

JAKE
A cross between a small-time mud-show
and a mining camp... Exhilarating.
OTTERLAKE

(prompting again)

You shared a bungalow with your first
leading man -- I even know his name:
Frank Fryer. How about that? And
I’m the only one that’s not doing a
book on you --

PISTER (0.S.)
Oh -- ?

JAKE
You aren’t drinking either.

PISTER
I thought you were, Otterlake --

OTTERLAKE
The whiskey’s for him, Pister, and
let’s have it -- ! ...The book, you
mean -- ? My book on Hannaford is

how I got to Hollywood -- The
publishers’ advance...

Lots of very busy business
in the back seat as JAKE’s

drink is prepared and

passed up to him...
34

OTTERLAKE (contd. )
Five chapters took the two of us
two and a half years... I finally had
to begin directing movies myself so I
could eat.

JAKE
The rest is history.

PISTER (0.S.)
And now you’re too busy?

OTTERLAKE
No, but he is -- And take it from me,
fellas, he hates being interviewed.

That’s what’s making this whole thing
today so delightful... Zarah’s idea --

 

HIGGAM
(unnecessarily)

Zarah Valeska.
OTTERLAKE
(assuming another
famous voice)
She is the one giving the party --
(another voice)
Yes, and she’s the one dreamed up
this crazy communications orgy, where
‘the younger people of the cinema’ --

(in his own voice)

-- whatever that means, are let loose
on him. Well, happy birthday...
35

OTTERLAKE (contd. )
I donated a lot of my old tapes --

(into yet another
impression)

Scattered ‘em here and there among you
cineastes, just out of kindness. We
can spare him a few questions, I
figure, if the answers come first.

The cineastes in the back
seat are too confused by
this virtuosity to really
take it in.

OTTERLAKE (contd. )

Answers are my department... The
first Hannaford films? -- Silents,
with David Fryer. Action pictures --

(another voice)

Plenty of action. Why, Jake and Dave
used to strip to the waist every
Saturday night, put their two pay
envelopes on the mantlepiece and fight
each other for the pot...

(then, after a
moment, in his own
voice)

Whatever happened to him?

JAKE
Fryers? I don’t know, kid.
36

OTTERLAKE

They come and they go.
JAKE

They sure n’hell go.
HIGGAM

John Dale, for instance?

(HIGGAM is trying to push
his way into an exclusive
club, but not making it,

of course.)

TIGHT TWO SHOT: JAKE and

OTTERLAKE

JAKE says nothing...
goes on driving.

HIGGAM’S VOICE (0.S.)
(he doesn’t know
when to stop)

The latest of all those actors you’ve
discovered...

JAKE
(after a moment, to
OTTERLAKE rather than
HIGGAM -- almost to
himself)
Discovered?... Like you went pearling

for ‘em and squeezed your movie star
out of an oyster...
37

A title is flashed on the
screen.
“SCENE MISSING”

The screen is in --

THE STUDIO PROJECITON ROOM
MAX DAVID
Just how much is missing?
BILLY
Not too much, really --
To BILLY’S relief the
title is now replaced
on the screen by --
HANNAFORD’S FILM...
MAX DAVID'S VOICE
What happens here?

BILLY’S VOICE
(unhappily)

I’m not really sure, Max. Maybe it’s
here she leaves the bomb...

MAX DAVID'S VOICE
What’s the bomb for?
BILLY’S VOICE
(with a short

nervous laugh)

Jesus, I don’t know...
38

Another title:
“SCENE MISSING”
BILLY'S VOICE (contd. )
Maybe he’s changing his mind, and
there won’t be any...

CUT TO:

THE ROAD
A rough looking character
roars past JAKE’S car on
a motorcycle, then slows,
signalling...
THE ROUGH CHARACTER

That cop back there -- he’s waving
at ya...

JAKE
Wave back Brooksie.
THE ROUGH CHARACTER
You guys are overloaded --
OTTERLAKE
Thanks, Jack.
THE ROUGH CHARACTER
Somebody’1l have to go --
OTTERLAKE

Can he go with you, Jack?
39

THE ROUGH CHARACTER

I don’t have the insurance... See ya
at the party --

He roars away up the road...
JAKE
Do I have the pleasure?
OTTERLAKE
He knows you, all right --

CAMERAMAN
(the one in front)

Pretty good director --
OTTERLAKE

He thinks he is you.
(then, with a quick
grin)

But don’t we all?

Meanwhile, PISTER is about
to be tossed out on his ear.

It seems that the law won’t
allow the SOUNDMAN to ride
on the trunk of the car, so
room has to be made for him
on a seat. As things work
out, it’s not HIGGAM but
PISTER who is ejected, tape
recorded and all...

tape recorder all forlorn
on the roadside.

BILLY

Well... Jake’s got a whole lot of

something to say)

There isn’t too much I can tell you,

We are in:

THE FILM (IN THE PROJECTION ROOM)

MAX DAVID
(irritably)

-.--So what are the toys about?
BILLY
(increasingly on the
defensive)
Well... before this, she’1l be
pretending to look in the window at
‘em -- That is, when we get around to
shooting it -- But really she was just
making sure nobody’s following her.
MAX DAVID

The boy’s been following her -- she’s
got to know that.

BILLY
(starting to drown
slightly)

Others, beside him... like the FBI or
something.

MAX DAVID

She’s some kind of crook?
BILLY

Some kinda radical, Max

(interrupting himself
speaking quickly)
43

BILLY (contd. )

Anyway, there’s some shops there, and
the boy thinks she’s been looking at
this doll...

MAX DAVID
(flatly)

Which doll -- ?

BILLY
(after a short silence)

The one he thinks she was looking at.
So... he goes in and buys it for
her...

(he offers this last as
though it explained

 

everything)
MAX DAVID sighs quietly,
but makes no comment.
CUT TO:
THE BUS
It stops as PISTER signals to
it... He climbs aboard.

MATT
(to PISTER)

Having fun, Mr. Pister?
PISTER

The people in that last car were kind
of awful.
44

MATT
Mr. Hannaford’s car?
PISTER
They threw me out. And then I was
picked up by a lot of video-freaks --
But they ran out of gas, or needed to
fix something...
As he takes a seat in what
might be called the executive
section, the bus starts up
again...
MATT
(well along with his
drinking)
Hippies...

(he pats the top of the
dummy’s head)

That’s what junior here is all about.
PISTER
(looking closely at the
dummy )

John Dale...?

ZIMMER
(to MATT)

The hair... that doesn’t make him a
hippie. Kids today --

MATT
(cutting him off)

Yeah?... What do you know about it?
45

ZIMMER

What does Jake know -- at his age?
MAGGIE

He’d better know.
PISTER

I’ve got some material on that...

PISTER fiddles with his
tape recorder.

ZIMMER
(dropping his voice)

The way I heard it, he’s putting up
his own money --

MAGGIE
(cutting him off with
the answer)
The banks wanted a name.

ZIMMER
(indicating the dummy)

And Jake wanted him...
They all stare at the
dummy .
A baby.
MAGGIE
The world’s full of ‘em, Zimmie, or

haven't you noticed?

CUT TO:
46

THE STUDIO PROJECITON ROOM

HANNAFORD‘S FILM continues
on the screen...

MAX DAVID finally breaks
the silence:

MAX DAVID
(a hint of weariness)

What’s in the package?

BILLY clears his throat
nervously.

BILLY

The package... Y’mean what she’s got
in her bag?

MAX DAVID

It’s either a bomb on her lunch --
huh?

BILLY
The kid’s package --
(quick change of tone)
You saw it already, that’s the doll..

Once again the title
appears on the screen:

SCENE MISSING
MAX DAVID
(carefully patient)

Just tell me this, Jimmy --
47

BILLY
Billy --
MAX DAVID

There going to be film where it shows
there’s a doll in this package?

BILLY
That’s easy, Max -- just an insert...
MAX DAVID
And the bomb?
BILLY
Yes, Max?
MAX DAVID

If it was left in the building, when
does it blow up?

BILLY

The bomb is... Well, we don’t
actually know...

MAX DAVID
(cutting in)

What do we know?
BILLY
(at the end of his
tether)

Better ask Jake.
CUT TO:

THE BUS

48

MAX DAVID
I'd better read a script.

(another brief
silence)

You haven’t got one? --

(this next is not a
question)

Jake is just making it up as he goes
along.

BILLY
(weakly)

He’s done it before...

MAGGIE
Look what he did with the other:
Glen Garvey... Courtney Saxon --
PAT

Courtney? He was selling vacuum
cleaners when Jake discovered him.

ZIMMER
(disregarding this
last)
And as for Hannaford himself --

MAGGIE
(quickly)

What about him?
CUT TO:

49

PAT

Branch Sutter -- he was a dish-
washer...

ZIMMER
(staring at the dummy)

Could be that he’s wrong this time...
MATT
Who says so?
MAGGIE
(turning to look out the

window)

Zimmer. He’s got this sensitive
nose.

ZIMMER
That’s all right, Maggie; never mind
the smell -- Everything stinks a
little.

MAGGIE

You’re telling mother.

JAKE'S VOICE (0.S.)

«+. When I’m done with an actor --
I’m done. He’s as dead as cold
mutton...
50

C.U. THE ACTRESS (DRIVING HER CAR)

LUCAS listening to the playback
on his tape recorder...

JAKE'S VOICE
It’s like the end of a love affair --
All you want is out...
JAKE is speaking to his
young friend OTTERLAKE
but this is being
photographed and recorded
in triplicate.
CAMERAMAN
Well, that’s what he got.
JAKE'S VOICE
For the director, you know -- it’s
a kind of...phony honeymoon. You're

the groom: You gotta make a fair job
of romancing the poor cows.

 

CUT TO:

THE BUS

Suddenly PISTER’S tape

recorder comes shrilly (HAND WRITTEN NOTE:

MATT’S VOICE
(playback)

Speak for yourself, Skippper --
MATT laughs in

(on camera)

That’s you Matt --
JAKE'S VOICE

We know ‘em, uncle -- we have to...
PISTER

That’s Mr. Hannaford --

THE OTHERS
Shhh -- !
JAKE'S VOICE
We gotta know about everybody -- The

creeps and freaks aren’t as much fun
as the real gypsies, but something
sets our teeth on edge, we do the
chic and manly thing, Matthew -- We
don’t sulk and turn away. No. We
bend over and take a good hard sniff.

MATT’S VOICE
You don’t have to bend over to smell a

hippie. He’s like a polecat; he meets
you more than half way.

appreciation of his own

recorded remark.

MATT
(on camera)

Like the gypsies, huh, Zimmie?
52

PISTER
Gypsies?...
PISTER is searching in
his files, looking up
‘G’ for ‘gypsy’...
MATT
It's what the gypsies can smell --
right, Zimmie? ["YES"]
ZIMMER

(an irritated mumble)
Death... anybody could smell it...
MATT
Aw, put a can on it --
ZIMMER

He’s turning sour, Matt... He’s
going bad.

LUCAS’ VOICE

«+. Dream projections of Hannaford
himself?

CUT TO:
THE ACTRESS (IN HERICAR)

Driving very fast, concentrating on
the job. TRUMAN LOCKWOOD is sitting
53

THE ACTRESS (IN HER CAR)

Beside her with his camera.
In the back are CICCIO TUCCI,
a cameraman from Rome, and
LUCAS RENARD.

 

LUCAS
Man, they’re real -- He made ‘em
real; gave ‘em existence -- he

moulded the clay --

TRUMAN
Or cut ‘em out with a pair of
scissors.

LUCAS
He conceived ‘em... Like a god.

THE ACTRESS
(under her breath)

LUCAS
-- a terrible and jealous god...
That's just what he’s been for this
new boy of his. John Dale is
Hannaford’s personal creation --
(lowering his voice)

There’s something else, too... an
even stronger claim...

(with a smile)

Very much in the Hannaford style...
54

CUT TO:

THE BUS

PISTER has been searching
in his files, looking up
‘G’ for ‘gypsy’...

PISTER
(bringing forth a
sheet of paper)
Here we are -- ‘Gypsies’ --

Transcribed from my own tapes.
I was there when he said it...

(handing the paper

to Pat)
Here...
PAT
(reading)
‘Gypsies -- Hitler got rid of them,

too. But he could have fumigated
the whole world, and there’d still be
the other ones -- the hippies and
beatniks -- the bums... Call ‘em
what you want to, they slack and
slouch around on the floor because
they like it down there. Talk about
the return to the womb? What about
the return to the cave?

Junk...

Junk is how you get there... That's
how you dig your way back... Junk for
the cool dreams, kid; and the cool,
dim, anonymous gang-bang... the

mutual jack-off’...

(he laughs)
55

PAT (contd.)

That’s sure tellin’ it like it

 

Now PAT’S VOICE is
replaced by JAKE'S
issuing tinnily from
the speaker of a tape

recorder:
JAKE'S VOICE
«+. Randy Moore, for instance: he was
a prop-boy... David Leigh was an
extra: Neil Trevor, Branch Sutter...
We see:

A NEW TAPE RECORDER --

Then a wider angle shows
us:

THE ACTRESS IN HER CAR

(Where LUCAS is playing
this tape)

JAKE'S VOICE

I happened to notice ‘em... But Dale
I found. Literally. Fished him out
of the sea. Now that’s what you’d
call a discovery... Dale was flapping
around like something you

bring up in a net...

BILLY’S VOICE
(playback)

You should have thrown him back. He
was too small.
56

LUCAS
(quickly to the others)

Just listen...

MAGGIE'S VOICE
(playback)

You had to go and make him an actor --
JAKE'S VOICE

We did what we could. Kept him on

the yacht; signed him on as a deck-

hand, made a sailor out of him. Or

tried to... Sure I rescued him.

(grimly; after a
moment )

I’ve been rescuing him ever since.

C.U. LUCAS as he turns
off the playback.

LUCAS
You get it? He saved the cat’s life.

TRUMAN
(turning to THE
ACTRESS -- half
questioning)

So John Dale’s in debt to the old man
for that...?

LUCAS
(earnestly)

Can you imagine a relationship more
all-consuming? -- between master and
slave?
C.U.: THE ACTRESS

57

She goes on driving and

makes no comment.

CUT TO:

THE STUDIO PROJECITON ROOM

Heavy silence from

MAX DAVID as HANNAFORD'S

FILM conitnues on the

screen...

A FLASH OF BILLY’S
ANGUISHED FACE

Silence...

BILLY
(plaintively)
Understand, Max -- This isn’t even a
rough-cut...

(beginning to betray a
certain desperation)

You’re going to have to see the
entire movie --

MAX DAVID

Sure. And Jake’s going to have to
shoot it --

BILLY

Like I told you, Max, an awful lot of
the footage is out at the ranch.
We'll be screening it for you at the
party.
58

[“DON'T HAVE” ]
MAX DAVID sits, sphinx-like
staring at the empty screen...

CUT TO:

ANOTHER BLANK MOVIE SCREEN

This is at the HANNAFORD RANCH (in a room used for film
projection)... No theatre-type seats here, just a
mixture of chairs and couches. These are occupied now
by a variety of guests...

To celebrate J.J. HANNAFORD’S birthday, ZARAH VALESKA
has invited the widest possible range of cineastes and
cinema buffs. She has managed to include such men as
CHARBOL, GODARD, RHOMER, TRUFFAUT and BURTOLUCCI, as
well as some of the brighter young Spaniards and
Englishmen. And of course, there are premier figures
from the younger Americans: JACK NICHOLSON, DENNIS
HOPPER, CASSAVETES, NAZURSKY, HENRY JAGLOM -- the whole
spectrum, from video-freaks to ANDY WARHOL.

By no means all of these are already here in this pro-
jection room. Many are scattered about the ranch,
arguing together or just quietly getting stoned. It’s
still early...

A GUEST
(one of the
celebrities)

Hey, that’s the Baron -- Ask him...

ANOTHER GUEST
(to THE BARON,
who has just
looked in at
the door)

We'd like to see the movie --
59

THE BARON
(politely)

We've got all night for it...
g g.
["DON'T HAVE” ]
(as he turns to
go)

Lots of people haven’t arrived --

 

THE DESERT ROAD AND DRIVEWAY LEADING UP TO THE RANCH

[“YES" ]
Night is falling fast as cars and buses jam into the
driveway. Guests of every description are piling out

and climbing the picturesque stairway leading up

through the great rocks to the ranch-house above...

They are pursued (as is just about everyone this

evening) by zoom lenses and “sun guns.”

SERIES OF SHOTS: (EXTERIOR AND INTERIOR) [“NO” ]

In_ conversations such as the following, the actual
speakers are only occasionally to be found directly
on camera. The voices, for much of the time,
Functioning as a sort of informal chorus.

OSSAWATOMIE DULUTH: (we are picking this up in the
middle of another argument):

++. we’re not inny of us gonna lose inny sleep ovah
Hannaford... (NOTE: This is an approximation of
OSSIE'S accent. It is given here merely as_a_ sample
and will not be repeated.

DELLA: Look -- I’ve known everybody --

OSSIE: I don’t deny him one single white hair on
his chest, lovely --

DELLA: And nobody's in his league --
60

OSSIE: But as a film-maker --

KLEE: For us, Jake is Scotch whiskey, and red steaks --
TRUMAN: Well, I wouldn’t put Hannaford with people

like Renoir or Eisenstein. Sorry -- Einstein.
INTERCUT:

THE STAIRWAY BETWEEN THE ROCKS

In the arms of grips, bus-boys, ZIMMER’S whole collection
of dummies, emerging from the bus, proceeds grotesquely
upwards...

Besides the arrival of students, scholars and other
cinema celebrities, the different cameras are recording
a mixed bag of “Beautiful People” (among whom OSSIE is
a popular figure). These people don’t count for much
among the film-makers, but they’re here -- along with
the midgets, the nudes from HANNAFORD’S movie, and a
surly tribe of video-freaks).

(These conversations are merely accompaniment: )
SUZIE: Quite a spread...

TRAVIS: The late and next to last Mrs. Hannaford,
of course, was loaded.

TONY: You should see the farm out in Kenya --
LIZA: Oh, that’s gone now -- And the yacht...

One of the numberless
cameras recording all
of this browses for a
moment over the fierce
shapes of big game heads
decorating some of the
walls.
61

THE BARON
(looking up at
a tiger's
head)
We got that one the hard way --
OSSIE

The hard way -- ? Standing up ina
hammock?

(change of tone)
Where’s the High Priestess?
DELLA

Zarah Valeska? Actually, Fiona’s
doing her... in black and white.

JACQUELINE
Priestess of what -- ?
OSSIE
The Clan, honey --

(with heavy
sarcasm)

The wild and woolly old Hannaford
wolf-pack --

(to DELLA)

Black and white?
62

DELLA

Well, it’s her period...
OSSIE

It's certainly his --
DELLA

Fiona’s even got old Otto what’s-
his-name on the camera.

OSSIE
Sounds campy to me.
DELLA

Campy? That early Hannaford style
is --

MANNY
(over-lap)

Von Stroheim --
JACQUELINE
(cutting her
off)

Yes, you’re thinking of Von Stroheim.
63

CHARBOL

Von Sternberg...

C.U.: A SLATE BOY
THE SLATE BOY
Zarah Valeska -- Take Two!

He exits with his
slate.

We are confronted with:

THE ROMANTICALLY BEAUTIFUL CLOSE-UP OF ZARAH VALESKA

OTTO, (a nice, tired old
cameraman) has triumphantly
Managed the correct, classic
arrangement of lights...

A pause,

We are in:

THE LIBRARY IN THE RANCH

With cool, professional patience, ZARAH
is submitting herself to a filmed inter-
view conducted by the metallic FIONA DE
LALLY (of day-time T.V. Fame), whose
voice, after a short, tense silence,
comes brightly from behind the lights:

FIONA
Zarah, you name has been linked
romantically with quite a few
celebrities...

Her voice trails away
into silence.
64

ZARAH
(pained but still
polite)

Wasn’t it understood that we were
going to talk about love affairs?

FIONA
(to the camera
crew)
Cut!
VOICE (0.S.)
Cut!
ZARAH

(quietly pained)

What you agreed to talk about is
Mister Hannaford --

The cameras have stopped
(but not that of the
DOCUMENTARY MAKER who is
covering this froma
semi-hiding place)

ZARAH'S patience remains
monumental.

ZARAH (contd. )
(a helpful
suggestion)
I can tell you a story...
FIONA
All right, darling... if you want to.
THE SLATE BOY

Zarah Valeska -- take Four!
65

ZARAH
(starting her
anecdote)
One night...
FIONA

(a hurried whisper)

Call me “Fiona” while you’re on
camera, darling: it’s so much
warmer... Go on...

ZARAH

This is many years ago in Paris -- a
big, open Bugatti turned and stopped
directly in front of me --

FIONA
(prompting unneces-—
sarily, with a dry
toothed smile of
professional
interest)

-- And this was Jake, of course?
ZARAH
(coolly, patiently
helpful)
It's how we first met, you understand
-- in the street. He just thought he
was picking up a whore --

FIONA

Ouch...! Wait a minute --
66

ZARAH
(in her wide-eyed
way)

Whores are out?

FIONA
(sweetly chiding)

It’s a woman’s program, dear.
ZARAH

It's a woman’s profession.

VOICES are heard calling

from various parts of

the ranch:
“He's coming -- !”
“It’s Hannaford --

“Here he is -- !"

CAMERAMAN (0.S.)
Do we cut?

FIONA
(quietly raging)

What do you think?
ASSISTANT (0.S.)

Cut!
67

Pandemonium! A crush of
cameras and cineastes...

THE BIG ROOM IN THE RANCH-HOUSE

 

SERIES OF QUICK FLASHES:

(like most of our incidental
scenes, this plays quickly but
takes much longer to describe.)

At first we catch only glimpses

of JAKE, ringed by blinding circles
of sun-guns and flash-bulbs...

ANOTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM

 

One of the friendlier cineastes,
flushed with drink and indignation,
is arguing with some of HANNAFORD'S
attackers:
THE CINEASTE
-- a fascist, for Chrissake? Jake --?

OTTERLAKE

You got the wrong man, fellas; how
about Jack Simon here?

JACK SIMON
You tell us, Brooksie.

OTTERLAKE
(to the others)

It’s in his contract -- Every picture
he directs, he gets to shoot all the

animals, personally. With a gun, that
is. They even pay him off in guns --
68

JACK SIMON
They pay me money, kid.

OTTERLAKE
(fixing SIMON
with a hard
smile)

And they say I imitate him.
JACK SIMON

(with a quiet
menace )

That’s your thing, Otterlake.

real good at imitations...

A BLONDE
(called MAVIS)

Do Jack Benny --

FRESH ANGLE:

JAKE is changing a big
empty glass for a very
full one. His eyes are

on THE ACTRESS. (She
pays no attention to
him)...

ABE VOGEL. The distin-
guished Hollywood agent,
makes his way through
the milling crowds to
JAKE'S side.

VOGEL

Hi there, Jake -- Happy birthday...
FRESH ANGLE:

JAKE, entering the
scene, cheerfully
sabotages his own
defense:

69

ANOTHER CINEASTE
Shall we define our terms?
OTTERLAKE

Shall we not.

JAKE
Spades, spics, micks, hunkies,
honkies and hebes -- There’s a few
terms for ya...

(burlesque red-

neck)
A fassatist now -- he don’t like them
people --
JULIE RICH
(behind JAKE)

And what kind of people do you like?

JAKE
(with a benign all-
embracing smile)
Nobody.
(turning to VOGEL)
Abie -- ! How nice to see you looking

so old.
70

THE BARON
(to JULIE, dip-
lomatically)

Nobody in the plural...
JULIE RICH
Then who in the particular?
JAKE turns to her with
that maddeningly blank
look of his -- (like the
proud parent of a hope-
less brat)...

Silence... then --

CUT TO:

THE BACK TERRACE

High on the great boulders

which loom decoratively

over the swimming pool,

JOEY (a PROP MAN) can be

seen arranging the dummies

in a long row on the rocks.

He calls down:
JOEY

Okay?

ZIMMER

Fine, Joey.

(he turns to
MAGGIE)

So how do they look?
71

ZIMMER (contd. )
(after a beat)

Stupid, that’s how they look...

CUT TO:

THE VALESKA TV _ INTERVIEW (IN THE LIBRARY)

FIONA
(coming on strong)

Darling, this marvelous bash you're

giving him... As I hear it, your

whole idea was to get Hannaford in

touch with the new generation...
ZARAH

And vice versa --

FIONA
And that’s why so few of your guests
are his own age -- ?

ZARAH

Most people of Mister Hannaford’s age
are too old for him...

CUT TO:

THE SIDE TERRACE

A minority group
of well-established
Hollywood citizens.
72

FIRST CITIZEN
(winding up a
little
speech)

++. Screen Director's Guild waiting
around on their tired old asses for
the phone to ring. His ass is tired
too, but he don’t sit on it. Jake
gets out and hustles.
SECOND CITIZEN
Sure -- just to keep up all of this...
THIRD CITIZEN (VOGEL)

Who says he’s keepin’ it up? I hear
he’s in trouble...

FOURTH CITIZEN
Power...

THIRD CITIZEN
What?

FOURTH CITIZEN
Look at the dictators... Symphony
conductors -- look at them. Power --
that’s the answer. Y’don’t keep
goin’ just playin’ golf. Geta
country under you, or a whole

orchestra -- that charges up the old
batteries...
73

FOURTH CITIZEN (contd. )
He stops -- catching sight
of JAKE, who has come up
behind them, drink in
hand...
How about it?
JAKE
(a sardonic lifting
of one eyebrow)
Give me an orchestra and we'll see.
JACK SIMON
(who has been
lurking B.G.)
And go on playing the same old piece?
JAKE
(with perfect
serenity)
Nice to see you, kid.

JAKE smiles sweetly at
him...

THE BARON

We do chug along a little, Mr. Simon,
with the times...

JACK SIMON

Which times? -- and who are you?
FRESH ANGLE:

74

THE BARON

There never was an artist yet who
didn’t work from memory.

JAKE
The Baron is in charge of metaphysics.

VOGEL
(turning on SIMON)

And who got him an invitation?
JAKE

“Confrontation” is the word, Abie.
Take it up with our hostess.

VOGEL

Zarah? She must be nuts.

JAKE has just caught sight
of a cute little blonde --

a very young one...

JAKE

Mother seems to think a little young
blood’1l be good for us --
75

FIRST CITIZEN
(lecherously
registering
the young
BLONDE)

She could be right at that!

JAKE
She’s always right... Excuse me,
fellas, but I think we got ourselves
a confrontation...

He starts moving in on
his target.

The CITIZENS chuckle
appreciatively as they
sit watching his progress.
FIFTH CITIZEN
He’s got another motivation --
FIRST CITIZEN
I’ll say --

FIFTH CITIZEN
(soberly)

The one that matters. He’s in love --
SECOND CITIZEN

Get off it, he’s too old for that --
CUT TO:

JULIE RICH’S GROUP

76

FOURTH CITIZEN
Some people never are. You'd be
surprised at how much mustard’s
being cut in the old people’s home.
SECOND CITIZEN
So who’s he in love with -- Zarah?

FIFTH CITIZEN

The movies.

KLEE
(in his solemn
Dutch accent)
I dig... It is not that he not
make female stars -- it is just that
he did not make them stars --
JULIE RICH
That's my whole thesis --
ROGER

Great thesis, the old man can still
score --

JACK SIMON

Who says so -- ?
77

JULIE RICH

How he scores -- who he scores with...
That, my friends, gets us into some
very interesting country...

THE BLONDE (IN A TIGHT GROUP SHOT)

JAKE lays a hand on
OSSIE’S shoulder.

He turns back to the
BLONDE:

OSSIE

THE BARON

Jake -- I think you know Ossawatomie
Duluth...

JAKE

Ill-met by candlelight, proud Titania!

Ossie... we like your little friend.

OTTERLAKE

around her)

Not his, Skipper. She’s mine.

bending his good ear
to her and oozing charm)

What’s your name, sweetie?

flying down with us to Mexico.
MAVIS (THE BLONDE)

JAKE
Piedras Negras.
MAVIS

MAVIS

OTTERLAKE

Dangerous breed, sweetie.
THE BARON

One of them once killed a friend of
ours --

JAKE
(closing in for the
kill)

Tomorrow we’re going to see what
happens to our new boy.

JULIE RICH AND COMPANY

ROGER
(losing patience)

So the old man has a kink or two --
what of it?

JACQUELINE
(quietly serious)

The old man is a destroyer.
JULIE RICH

What he creates, he has to wreck.
It's a compulsion.
80

ROGER
It’s a theory.
JULIE RICH
I’ve got names and dates...
The folder she’s holding
is, indeed, rather
suggestive of a dossier.

But before we can hear
more of this --

CUT BACK TO:

JAKE'S GROUP

MAVIS
Gee, I don’t know... I’ve got school
on Monday.

JAKE

others)

I‘ll write a note to the teacher.

CUT TO:

at his side, sitting
glumly in front of his
dummies, all arrayed
before him...

MAGGIE
Come on in and have a drink, Zimmie --
ZIMMER
I don’t know these people.
Why they’s leadin’ actors nowadays --
stars even -- I don’t know their

ear, he idicates
ZIMMER’S dummies)
Y‘don’t know his name --

faction)
Oscar. That’s his real name... In

his school days whataya think he was
famous for -- ?

ZIMMER
Fornication.
PAT
(with grim satis-
faction)
We got us somebody tonight who’s gonna
tell us all about it --
(into phone)

Yeah?
82

FRESH ANGLE:
BERTOLUCCI
(looking up at the
dummies )

Quite impressive, I just say.

(he indicates the
dummies )

ZIMMER

So is Mr. Dale. To look at him you'd
swear he was real.

A_ DUSKY CORNER SOMEWHERE

MATT
(speaking into
JAKE'S ear, the
full Mafioso)
New information -- about Dale...
JAKE

Well, Uncle Matthew?
MATT

We found out where he comes from --
A big, rich family out in Iowa...

MAGGIE
How do you like those apples? Your

starving orphan went to boarding
school --
Silence...

83

MATT

We got one of his teachers. Want
to see him?

JAKE
(after a beat)

Sure. Pipe him aboard, Uncle Matthew.
MATT

He’s coming out with Billy.
JAKE

Fine. Billy’s bringing Max --
MAGGIE

Yeah, when’s he joining the party?

(something in MATT'S
eye stops her)

MATT

He isn’t.

MAGGIE
Any word from Texas?
MATT

I sent a car out to the airport...
Another short
silence...

He smiles sweetly at
them all and moves
away...

CUT TO:

FRESH ANGLE:

84

MAGGIE

Jake -- Can I start the screening?
Half the kids are in there waiting...

JAKE
Think some of them went to expensive
boarding schools? Give ‘em three

reels or so, and pass among ‘em with
a tin cup.

OTTERLAKE

The Hannaford Mafia isn’t looking
very festive --

JAKE

Yeah... I wish they’d go home...
OTTERLAKE

Trouble?
JAKE

Four days... that’s a long time,
Brooksie.
FRESH ANGLE:

85

OTTERLAKE

Till what?

MAVIS THE BLONDE dances
up to JAKE with another
stiff whiskey. He accepts

it gratefully.

He urges her away...
Then turns back to
JAKE.

JAKE

Thanks, sweetie... Where’s your former
boyfriend?

OTTERLAKE
(moving into scene)

He’s here and your going to the
movies --

MAVIS
What?

OTTERLAKE
(firmly)

Just follow the crowd...

What's Friday?
JAKE

Friday we close down.
86

OTTERLAKE
Jesus...
A crowd of guest
passes by on the

way to the screening...

You can’t finish the picture in four
days --

JAKE
(raising his glass)

I’ve been over-schedule before. Let’s
drink to that...

OTTERLAKE
How many times have you been broke,
Skipper?
A short, tense pause...
JAKE
At my present age, Brooksie -- just
once.

CUT TO:
87

THE PROJECTION ROOM AT THE RANCH

 

Lights dim out, there are
the usual stirrings and
throat-clearings... Then,
on the screen we resume:

HANNAFORD’S FILM

 

The door to this (part-time) projection room is
important: when people open it, their silhouettes
move across the screen. THE ACTRESS is the first
to make such an entrance and, as she finds herself
a place, is the cause of interested attention...
Later there’s another interruption: the opening
door (the square of light blanking out part of the
screen -- the crouching and ducking silhouettes as
new arrivals sneak heavily into the room). This
time it’s JULIE RICH with a couple of journalist
colleagues. They make a dash for it into the
darkest corner of the room. Here, there aren’t
any chairs, but the view of the screen in unimpeded,
so they sit on the floor. ROGER and DENISE KLEE
(a film-making partnership) are squatting nearby,
their backs to the wall.

Soon others in the room become aware of a low and
rather venomous buzzing from the corner.

ROGER
(addressing JULIE
RICH)
Don’t try to lay that on us --

KLEE
(total incredulity)

You can say almost anything else
about him --
They do, but for the
moment they shut up.

THE FILM continues...

88

JULIE RICH
(elaborately
patient, wind-
ing up an
argument )

If -- and I say “if,” mind you --
actually going to bed with a boy
is the only definition you'll
accept --

VARIOUS GUESTS
Shhh -- !

CASSIE

Do you mind -- ?
89

A WINDOW IN THE “PROJECTION ROOM”

OTTERLAKE stands looking
in at the FILM being
projected now for the

guests...
CAMERAMAN
Hey -- put Hannaford there...
There, where you’re standing.
OTTERLAKE
(grinning)

Come on, cooperate...

JAKE
What for?

CAMERAMAN
The reflection in the glass -- The
face and the film inside -- a real

Hannaford set-up!

During this OTTERLAKE
has laughingly urged
JAKE into place. Now,
as the camera turns,
he fills in the lull
with a quotation:

OTTERLAKE
“These, your actors, were all spirits-

And are melted into air...
Into thin air...”
90

JAKE has started a
long pull at his drink
but is interrupted by
the voice of JULIE

RICH:
JULIE RICH
Tatum, Fryer, Leigh...
Branch Sutter... Garvey...
He smiles at her...
Then, after a short
silence:
JAKE

Absent friends.
JULIE RICH
And John Dale... All made by you

--. Funny. We don’t see one of those
men tonight at your party.

JAKE
Tonight is for the freaks and
snoops, lady -- If you’ll excuse us,
please...

OTTERLAKE

Why don’t you go in and see the
movie, lady -- like everybody else?

They wait for her to
go... She does.
91

JAKE
“Thin air...”
OTTERLAKE

“And like the baseless fabric of
this vision, shall dissolve...”

Did you know they had dissolves in
Shakespeare?

(playing it up a
little for the
benefit of the
camera)

Sure he does: he knows everything
in Shakespeare. “The Hannaford
family curse -- ”

JAKE

And he knows everything about the
Hannafords; that’s my curse...

OTTERLAKE
We all know about old Grandad, Junius
the First -- “The great Irish
tragedian in the tinseled toga -- “

JAKE

The Shakespeare comes from him,
all right.
92

OTTERLAKE

Handed down, with a few other things
-- “Booze and the Bard” -- Right?...
As for the booze part of it -- Well,
if he hasn’t quite made it asa
rummy -- nobody can say he hasn’t
tried!

JAKE

I’m seeing little pink directors at
this very minute.

OTTERLAKE
But Junius -- Ah, “there was a most
distinguished souse”... Another

line of yours.
JAKE
That's what’s so nice about Brooksie
-- I don’t have to repeat myself, he
does it for me...
OTTERLAKE
(continuing to
quote)
“ -~ BR noble Roman shanty Irishman;
Sure, even when he cut his wrists and
killed himself...”
(looking around)
We've lost our camera, haven’t we?

JAKE

You’re losing me.
Pause...

A pause...

93

OTTERLAKE
“Like Seneca, old Junius bled to
death in a bathtub -- one of the
few times he ever sat in one. But
Junius Junior -- ” (that’s your daddy)
“He even made it into High Society --
a pioneer among the micks, blazing
the trail for the Kellys and the
Kennedys... Piss-elegant. He chose
the chandelier...”

JAKE
A human tape recorder.

OTTERLAKE

That's me, Skipper.

JAKE
I didn't know you had the chandelier.
OTTERLAKE
I’ve got everything.
In the old Hollywood Hotel it was...
They found him, one Sunday morning,
hanging from it. After which you

had to go to work for a living...
As a prop man, etcetera...
94

JAKE
Yeah... you got it all.
OTTERLAKE

I’m the Authority.

(Is there -- behind the
complacency of that
statement -- an overtone

of old affection still
remaining? If so, it
rings a little false in
JAKE'S ears... Somehow
his young friend has
staked out a claim of
ownership)...

He looks at him with
something very cold in
his eyes... OTTERLAKE
smiles back at him with
proprietory approval...

OTTERLAKE (contd. )
So... what do we do next?
JAKE

We never know, do we?

A pause...

JAKE is in a sort of

reverie... This has

commenced earlier and

comes from thoughts

far removed from family
anecdotes...
He raises his glass as

95

JAKE (contd. )

We're feeling fine -- it’s early
morning --

OTTERLAKE
Not quite yet.
JAKE
This is a flash-back...

You just happen to notice somebody
trying to drown himself. Some young
pink nobody ever heard of. And how's
this? After you dry him out, you try
to get him interested in staying
dry...

Hell, you can recite that story
backwards. And it’s lousy -- I can’t
get him interested in anything.
Everything’s a drag, man -- Be a
movie actor? That just bores him to
death... He doesn’t die, though; no,
he’s cured of that. He merely kicks
me rather sharply in the groin and
walks away...

though offering a toast.

Speaking of suicides.

OTTERLAKE
Come on, Skipper -- let’s go to the
movies...

They start away together.

CUT TO:
96

THE BIG ROOM

One group (among all the
groups) clustered around
LUCAS, or some other
CINEASTE... He’s holding

up his pocket tape recorder.

INTERCUT: MIXED REACTIONS
FROM OTHER CINEASTES

Listening to the recorded
voices.

AN EARNEST VOICE
(on the playback)

... Reflection of your attitude --
right, Mr. Hannaford? God isn’t

dead -- ?
JAKE'S VOICE
(playback)
Well, kid -- He’s certainly Jewish.

FRESH ANGLE:
VOGEL
What’s that about?
OTTERLAKE

One of my tapes. I’ve donated them to
the cause.

VOGEL

Tapes -- from that book you're doing?
97

OTTERLAKE
From the book we're not doing... I’m
the little corner store, Abe, that
has to give way to the supermarket.
VOGEL

You’re the only big director who ever
tried to write about him.

OTTERLAKE
I had to stop trying.
VOGEL

But you two are friends... Close
friends --

JULIE RICH
(lurking at OTTER-
LAKE’S shoulder)

That's what interests me: just how
close you are...

AL

Abe, this is Juliette Rich, the
distinguished critic. Abe Vogel, the
dean of Hollywood agents... Miss Rich
is doing a “study in depth” -- and
she’s so far down she’s got the bends.

(turning to the

CINEASTE WITH THE

TAPE RECORDER)

What happened to the tape?
Laughter... OTTERLAKE
grins and continues:

98

THE CINEASTE
I’m changing it.
OTTERLAKE

Don’t bother. I know all the material
... Religion? Here it is, The Gospel
According to Jake: “God the Gather is
an old Jew invented by a lot of other
old Jews in a hopeless attempt to put
down the Jewish Mother.”

He says that’s what it’s all about --

the whole new scene... Even his
movie --
JULIE RICH
(cutting in
sharply)
How’s that again -- ? His mov --
OTTERLAKE

(cutting her off
in turn, very
quickly)

The kids -- they're all turned on to
Her...

VOGEL

The Jewish mother?
More laughter...

Total silence follows

that...

The crowd is startled

99

OTTERLAKE

(Louis Armstrong
or Flip Wilson)

God? -- She sure is a mother -- !

JULIE RICH
(unsmilingly)

You said about his mov --
JAKE
(now it’s his turn
to cut her off)

We don’t talk about the movie.

by his sudden appearance,
and also (JAKE himself
feels) a bit dashed by

the abruptness of his
tone... He smiles his

most benevolent and
priestly smile.

Try the Baron here... Under torture
he might squeal a little. He writes
the scripts --

THE BARON

So Mr. Hannaford likes to say --
This stops her dead
in her tracks...

100

JULIE RICH
(to THE BARON)

Then this is your idea-- ?

THE BARON
(amiably blank)

What idea?

JULIE RICH
(losing her cool
a little, she
has a hunch
they're putting
her on)

Don’t pretend to be stupid. You're
the brainy one in this famous club

of yours -- or “Clan: or whatever you
call it --
THE BARON

It's a highly informal organization.

JULIE RICH
That tape we were hearing -- the
subject was God... Is He a member?
JAKE

She.
101

OTTERLAKE

You heard the man, lady.
JULIE RICH

I heard you imitating him.
JAKE

He does other people better.

OTTERLAKE
(as Jack Benny)

Well -- It came to Our Prophet in
a blinding flash of light, that Old
Mister White Whiskers has shot his
last thunderbolt, so... we’re back
where we started --

(his own voice)
-- Back to Mamma.

(playing to the
gallery)

His words, mark you -- The Last of The
Male Chauvinists --

JACK SIMON
(a sneer out of
the shadows)

I like him as Hannaford. That’s his
beat. You’d swear he is Hannaford.

OTTERLAKE
(with an icy
smile)

That's real nice, Jack -- coming from
you.
JAKE intervenes,

patching up a nasty
little moment between

102

the two young directors.

Laughter and some
applause...

JAKE

We’re all ruled by the wind, aren't
we, lady? So if the Lord is a lady,
and God's will is Her will -- then we
can relax, can’t we? And stop
expecting the universe to be logical.

 

OTTERLAKE

Thus spaketh Jake.

JULIE RICH is slightly
dazed by all this glib
recitation, but she makes

a quick, if slightly

lopsided recovery.

JULIE RICH
(indicating
OTTERLAKE )

And how does your disciple feel about
the new film --

JAKE
(cutting this
subject off again)

He’s the apostle, lady.
(JAKE, of course, is

putting her on; and

OTTERLAKE plays up to

103

it -- drawing, as usual,
on his powers of memory

and mimicry)

OTTERLAKE
Sure, just like St. Paul...
(aside to JAKE)
I know the lyrics for that one, too.
(in JAKE'S voice)

Paul was a big man, y'know. He put it
all together, packaged it --

(in his own
voice)

Sounds like a producer.
(as JAKE again)

Well, kid, he got the final cut.
Jesus was dead -- the subject was in
public domain when old Paul dreamed
up Christianity, and stuck then
“anity” into Christ --

JAKE
As long as I’m still twitching,
Brooksie -- you ain’t gonna stick it
into me.

JULIE RICH does not fail

to catch the veiled

aggression in this last...
104

(During this last MAVIS,
OTTERLAKE’S young blonde

has tripped into scene
bearing a stiff drink

for JAKE)

OTTERLAKE glances
quickly at JAKE...
who is smiling at
JULIE with an air

JULIE RICH
(to JAKE)

Isn’t that just what he’s doing? ...
Otterlake’s new picture is breaking
the house record at the Music Hall,
and when his own production company
goes public, they say he’1ll walk
away with forty million dollars...

OTTERLAKE
And you'll say I stole it all from
Mr. Hannaford... I’1l never walk
away from that.

JULIE RICH
(sibylline)

Yes... you two have to stick together.

of perfect benevolence...

JAKE

Please don’t tell us what you mean
by that.
105

JACK SIMON
(with a leer)

Whatever it means, you hadn’t ought
to be impertinent to an Apostle...

MAVIS
(with some
petulance)

Hey, this is a drag -- how did we get
off into religion -- ?

OTTERLAKE
To get away from movies.
(back to JULIE)
The name of the game, lady.
THE BARON
(pouring a
little oil on
the troubled

waters)

We should get away from both. A
mystery should be left in peace.

VOGEL
(a voice from the
outlying suburbs
of this group)

Mystery -- ?
Miss RICH thinks
she has a smart
answer to that one:

106

JULIE RICH

Games are only fun till someone
loses.

VOGEL
(irritated to find
himself so much
out of his depth)

What mystery?

OTTERLAKE
(smiling at
MAVIS)

I’m a good loser, lady -- a lovely
loser.

(to VOGEL)

Movies and friendship... those are
mysteries...

(was there just
a tiny sting in
the last?...
Anyway, his
tone brightens
abruptly)

And religion... The Baron’s into that
but also I know his material --

(as THE BARON)

“A mystery may reveal, it never
explains.”
107

JULIE RICH
Like Mr. Hannaford --

JAKE
(quickly, brightly)

Right, sweetie. Just like me and God.
He started to go,
but turns back for the
curtain line:
If it weren’t for the difference of
sex, how could you tell us apart?

CUT TO:
108

THE FILM

Continues...

And now, another interruption:
There is a low buzz of
interest as JAKE’S shadow is
cast upon the screen...

Drink in hand, he takes a
chair at the side of the
room and sits there watching...

From the SOUND-TRACK he can
hear his own voice (picked up
on the set by his own micro-
phone -- speaking from behind
his own camera) issuing
directions to the actors --
giving quiet but insultingly
obscene commands to the

actor JOHN DALE by way of
guiding the erotic action...

(The sequence is the one on the

rusty wreck of a bed in the
back-lot of the abandoned

movie studio)...

Suddenly a voice is heard in
the projection room itself:

THE VOICE
(hoarsely vulgar)

We oughta be coming soon to
that shot where he walked off
The picture...

huh, Mr. Hannaford?...
109

No reply to this from
JAKE...

THE VOICE in the
audience persists --

ANOTHER VOICE

Sure; they got it all on filn,
y‘know,... I was there; Jake went
right on cranking: the whole thing --
where he marches straight out of the
studio bare-assed...

Again, no comment from
JAKE...

And now, as he sits
watching it, we come to
that moment in the action
(THE GIRL’S scissors on
THE BOY’S hair) when JOHN
DALE jumps up off the bed,
strides through the mass of
movie equipment, off the
set and away...

JAKE'S VOICE can be heard
on the SOUND-TRACK (of the
FILM) ordering his camera-
men not to cut...

A wave of half stifled
laughter here in the

projection room accom-
panies this... Then a
110

(contd. )

slightly embarrassed
silence...

Suddenly the screen
goes blank.

A pause...

JAKE
(quietly)

Let’s keep going.
But nothing happens.

In the shadows we can just
make out JAKE as he turns

an inquiring look in the
direction of the projectionist.

Then the door opens...

But this time, no bright
light is thrown on the
screen. All lights, in
fact, have been turned off,
and what enters now through
the door is an immense comic
birthday cake -- a fabrication
of film cans crowned with a
perfect forest of kitchen
candles. “Ohs!” And “ahs!”
(rather campily) from the
crowd... THE BARON is in
charge of ceremonies (the
gag is clearly his)...
111

Everyone gathers in a circle
around the mass of candles,
They are big kitchen candles,
far too numerous to blow out
in the traditional single
puff.
The buzz and chatter trails
away into silence...
THE BARON

Nobody was sure just how many
candles...

JESSEL

Looks like the Chicago fire.

C.U. ZARAH (INTER-CUT WITH JAKE)

(candle flames between their
faces and the lens)

ZARAH
You should make a wish...

JAKE
(after a beat)

What for?
(Why is that faint shadow
of pain in JAKE'S eyes?)
INTER-CUT: JESSEL'S ATTEMPTED ORATION

A VOICE
(boringly raucous)

Better start blowing -- !
112

JACK SIMON
Think you can make it, Hannaford?

JAKE has caught JULIE'S
eye...

JAKE

Take a lotta blowing -- I’d say it’s

a job for Miss Rich. She’ll huff and
she’ll puff, and she’ll blow the house
down --

JULIE, exchanging looks
with JAKE, takes a puff
at the candles -- none
go out.
Laughter... Everybody
starts blowing...
Finally the last candle
is out.
THE BARON
Okay, let’s get back to the film...
A PAUSE...
Nothing happens.

Has something happened
to the machine?

No, it’s a black-out --
The whole ranch is in

 

darkness.
VOICES
“We didn’t just blow out the candles,
we blew out a fuse!”...”Too Many
camera lights -- it’s the generator --

He’s got his own out here...”
113

OTTERLAKE moves next to
JAKE as he comes out of

the projection room...

AL (ever the eager aspirant
to full membership in the
CLUB) closes in from
another direction.

OTTERLAKE
(in one of his
British voices)

By God, Hannaford! This will
shake the chancelleries of
Europe!

AL
(comically portentious)

This is no accident, Otterlake,
it’s sabotage.

The “sun-guns” still work,
of course. There is much
flaring and glaring of
these as JAKE, with MAVIS
glued to his side, moves
through the dark, crowded
rooms... OTTERLAKE and

AL follow.

OTTERLAKE
(another voice)

Sabotage, eh? Whom do you
suspect -- that, er... cineaste?

He indicates JACK SIMON
JAKE
He wouldn’t know his cineaste

from a hole in the ground. No,
probably a midget with a grudge...

SERIES OF FLASHES (ALL OVER THE DARKENED RANCH)

VOICES

“Y'getting anything?”
"Not with color.”
"Black and white, maybe...?”

"Hey! -- Those South Americans -- They

"Black and white? See how much we can

"How much’11 you pay?”
"There’s a regular price -- “

"Not tonight there won't be -- ”

CALB (the handy-man) having
confessed his inability to
deal with break-down of

the ranch’s generator, quickly
organizes a whole bunch of
lamps and lanterns from the

stables.

Thus, we have been

watching (in a SERIES OF
DIFFERENT ANGLES) the gradual
re-illumination of the party...

JACK SIMON
Saw your film...
OTTERLAKE
You can’t see anymore of it tonight.
MAVIS
(looking around for
JAKE who has

suddenly vanished)

Why not?
FRESH ANGLE:

115

OTTERLAKE
No lights, no projection, dum dum...
(to SIMON)
Anyway, I didn’t make it.
JACK SIMON

You will, kid, you will... Lemme tell
ya what I think of it --

JACK NICHOLSON
Hey, how about that drive-in -- ?
That last little town you pass on the
way out here --

OTTERLAKE

Beautiful. Find one of the stooges
somebody they’1l listen to --

JACK SIMON
What’s wrong with you, kid?

You’‘re the one that’s good at
imitations --

MAVIS
Do Jack Benny.
OTTERLAKE
(with the same
hard smile as
before)

Get us a drink, sweetie, go on -- two
big ones...
MAVIS retreats into
the shadows...

116

MAVIS
How’ll I find you?
JACK SIMON

Just look for Hannaford, he glows in
the dark. Right, Brooksie?

OTTERLAKE
(to SIMON)
What you imitate is him -- The man

himself. Your idea of him: the
bullfights and the big game -- the
whole macho bit...

 

JACK SIMON
The truth is, as a macho he ain’t all
that much. He just likes be with
‘em. That chest ain’t near as hairy
as he’d like you to think. Your
guy’s a big, pink lobster -- nothing’s
really tough except the shell.

OTTERLAKE
Now what...? I ask you what’s so
tough about you -- and you ask me
if I wouldn’t like to find out; and
then we entertain the guests with an
old-fashioned Hollywood first fight?
JACK SIMON

If that’s how you want it, kid.
117

OTTERLAKE

Old-fashioned is the word, all right!
Even the way you do Jake -- Maybe he
was like that thurty years ago...

JACK SIMON

I’‘1l give him forty years -- My
Jake'll still lick the shit outta
his.

JAKE has been overhearing
this... Now he steps for-
ward out of the shadows,
pushing JACK SIMON and

(with surprising speed)
rabbit punches him...

SIMON doubles up for a
minute; and at this, BILLY
(with equally surprising
speed) seizes the opportunity
to blackjack him senseless
... Then, with a wicked grin,
he defuses his weapon, which
turns out to be an ashtray
wrapped in a napkin.

BILLY
(putting the ashtray
back on a table)

I wasn’t even here.

OTTERLAKE
(to BILLY)

What the hell did you do that for?
JAKE

Putting a little extra zing in the old
lobster’s clay Brooksie.
118

MUSIC strikes up bravely in the darkness.

OTTERLAKE stares at
him...

He turns and starts
away...

CUT TO:

JAKE (contd. )
We'd do the same for you. We

imitation Hannafords have got to
stick together.

PAT’S VOICE
(calling)

What happened, Jake?
Dale -- ?
JAKE

What do you think?

Who knows? Johnny Dale, maybe.
He could have snuck into the
generator with his little
monkey wrench...

BILLY

Jake, I gotta talk to you...
JAKE

Sure, Billy. First take care of

the wounded while I say hello to
Mother.
He goes...

CUT TO:

119

BILLY
(starting away)

A couple wranglers can take
him to the local first aid.

We’re donating his motorcycle
to charity.

OTTERLAKE

I hope you aren’t proud of
that, Skipper.

JAKE

What do you think?

THE LIBRARY (FOR THE TV INTERVIEW)

Surrounded by OTTO’S

skillful arrangement of

candles, MISS VALESKA
is continuing her

ordeal:

Okay, Zarah -- ! No romance!
VOICE (0.S.)

FIONA
(after another heavy
little silence)
I do wish you could bring yourself

to open up on Jake just a little...
Professionally at least --
120

ZARAH
Hello...
HER VIEWPOINT:
JAKE has come up behind
the camera, and has been
watching this last.
JAKE

We don’t have much of a part,
do we, Beautiful?

INTERCUT
ZARAH AND JAKE
ZARAH
We made just half of a picture
together.
JAKE

In Austria, and what happened?
ZARAH
Hitler -- that’s what happened.
FIONA
He threw you out, Zarah?
JAKE
Miss Valeska threw him out --
Eventually. The rest of us, of
course, were in there behind her,
I was way behind...
AL

But you did liberate the Ritz.
121

JAKE
Her friend Ernest put in for
that one -- but I was three
bottles ahead of him.

FIONA
(who never gives up)

Pretend he isn’t here, darling --
Let’s have the truth about him...

ZARAH
(after a beat)

Every man contains within
himself the whole condition of
humanity.
JAKE
Write that down, somebody.
ZARAH
Somebody did.

JAKE
(to FIONA)

She gave me the book.
ZARAH

Mr. Hannaford always enjoys
pretending to be ignorant.

JAKE
And spoilt the present by

telling me who gave it to her.
Mr. Ossawottomie Duluth --
(These two are not so
innocent as to have
forgotten that the
cameras exist, but
by now they honestly

122

FIONA
(quickly, scenting
smut )
Ossie -- ?
JAKE

The queers adore great women.
They like all women. They’re
the only sex that does.

FIONA
Come on -- !

ZARAH
(turning to her)

True: real men never like us.
Men only like men...

don’t care about them.)

JAKE
(turning back to
FIONA as he gets
caught up in his
theme )
And women... keep us away from
each other --
ZARAH
Ah... “But if I cut him off,” we
ask ourselves, “cut him off from
all his good companions -- what

will be left of him?”
(pause)

“An amputee, perhaps? An emotional
basket case?”
123

JAKE
You chop away all the same...
A month's silence.

Half a man is better than
none.

He moves away...

A CAMERA following...
The voices of the TV

people retreating as
he leaves them behind:
OTTO’S VOICE
(the Cameraman; after
a beat)
We start again?

FIONA’S VOICE
(murderous )

You haven't been shooting?
What about these other
cameras?
OTTO’S VOICE
They’re on their own, of course.

FIONA’S VOICE

Well, who the hell gave them
permission -- ?

JAKE moves to

OTTERLAKE, taking ["Broke” }
the drink out of
his hand...

JAKE

(after a beat)

Who told you I was broke?
124

OTTERLAKE

Well... Billy said you’ve lost
the boat --

For a moment there’s
a baleful look in JAKE’s
eye as he looks up from
his drink.
JAKE
He did, did he...?

How about the roof over my
head, Brooksie, how dos that

grab you?
OTTERLAKE
The ranch -- ?
JAKE
Out in the snow, kid -- over
the hill... and down Dale --

But let’s not ever speak of
Master John Dale, shall we?

Ever.
OTTERLAKE
(covering his extreme
discomfort with a
flare of temper)
Dale -- ! That’s what really
bugs you, isn’t it? With all
your troubles -- Jesus, what’s

one lousy leading man?
JAKE

Less than the dust, kid, from my
chariot wheels.
125

OTTERLAKE
I‘ll drink to that --

JAKE
(staring into his
glass)

You’1l never catch up with me.
OTTERLAKE
That’s what I’m told...

JAKE raises his eyes to
him... OTTERLAKE may have
expected some slight
acknowledgement of this
delicate compliment, but
JAKE'’s look is curiously
withdrawn, and almost sly.

JAKE
Cute... very cute.
MUSIC again... (alter-
nately, Flamenco and New
Orleans jazz). It continues

throughout the following:

CUT TO:

THE LIBRARY

 

THE SLATE BOY

Take twenty-three.
126

He leaps nimbly out of
scene...

MISS VALESKA’s candles
still glow enchantingly
between the flowers...
but no MISS VALESKA!
FIONA
She’s gone!
OTTO
Sun-gun...!

SCRIPT GIRL

Well... maybe she’1ll be
back.

OTTO
(deep over-lap)

I wouldn’t use a light like
that on Miss Valeska...

FIONA
(under hear breath)

What could a light do to her -- ?
She’s had so many face lifts,
she’s ready to choke...!

REVERSE ANGLE: ZARAH

In the doorway.
Silence...

All the
knocked

CUT TO:

fight is
out of FIONA.

127

FIONA (0.S.) (contd.)
(appealing to her crew)

All I did was mention the word
"SEX"...

ZARAH
There wasn’t any.

FIONA
(floundering)

I’m sorry, I...
ZARAH

You meant with Mr. Hannaford, I
suppose.

(making a simple
statement)

There wasn’t ever... No sex at all.
128

["MAFIA 2 + 3”]

THE TERRACE

MAGGIE has succeeded in
intercepting JAKE and moves
him toward a gathering of
the Clan.

MAGGIE

Frankl’s here -- he just got in from
Texas...

BILLY
(entering scene
from another
direction)

I brought that teacher, Jake; I got
him waiting at the pool...

JAKE stops in front of
HYMIE FRANKL (a long-
time, part-time member
of the organization).
FRANKL
Lousy, awful trip...

JAKE
(turning to BILLY)

And you -- ?

BILLY
(startled)

Jake! I just told you...

JAKE
(quietly)

That's kept you busy -- just
collecting school-teachers?
129

(BILLY hopes his rueful
grin will signal a
reminder to JAKE that
he’s also been occupied
with SIMON... But
there’s no indication
that this registers.)

FRANKL
(plaintively)

Hey, can I please get myself
something to eat?

JAKE
Didn't they feed you, Joey?
MATT

All they do on airplanes is feed you.

FRANKL
Turbulence...
JAKE
(cheerfully)
You threw up? Give him some candy,
Billy.
BILLY

(patiently)

I didn’t “collect” the teacher, Jake,
he met me at the screening --
He stops. He knows
the answer...
AL is behind him.

130

JAKE
(quickly, quietly)

With Max -- ?
FRANKL

Look, Jake, those oil guys, they
want no part of us.

JAKE
(after a short
silence, cheerfully)

Neither does Max -- Right, Billy?

THE BARON
(joining the
group)
Max David -- ?
FRANKL
That dirty crook -- who needs him?
MAGGIE

We do...
131

AL

Max? -- he’s so crooked he’s got
rubber pockets so he can steal soup.

He looks around -- not

really hoping for a
laugh and certainly,
not getting it...

They turn to find him
standing nearby...

MATT

Our best chance was that oil money...
BILLY

And Otterlake -- what about him?
OTTERLAKE

Yes, what about me?

AL
(a lightning quick
cover-up)
Brooksie! -- we just wondered if you

knew about the drive-in?

BILLY
(chiming in)

Yes, we're screening the rest of
the --

JAKE
(cutting them off)

He’s seen the movie --
132

OTTERLAKE
Not everything.
BILLY
(with his nervous
little laugh)

Well, we don’t have everything...

OTTERLAKE
(smoothly)

Leave it to Jake. Pretty soon you'll
have too much.

BILLY

You bet! We’ve had our troubles
before...

OTTERLAKE
(arranging an
exit)

Get you a drink, Skipper?

JAKE
(acknowledging the
tact)

Thanks, Brooksie.

MAGGIE
(when OTTERLAKE
has left, lower-
ing her voice)

At Max's studio he’s the golden-haired
boy, isn’t he --
133

MATT

He’s got his own company...
BILLY

Tied in with Max --
MAGGIE

That's what I mean, Billy --

JAKE
(looking at BILLY)

He blew it, Maggie... Must be all
that candy he eats.

BILLY
Me -- ?
MATT
(to BILLY)
You were the one with Max -- where is
he?
BILLY

Not here, that’s where he is -- !

(getting a bit
querulous)

-- And what the hell’s the candy
got to do with it?

JAKE, lifting another long
drink, looks at BILLY with
his most sweetly patient,

sacerdotal smile...
134

JAKE
Could be it’s softening your brain,
Uncle.

BILLY
It's for the sugar... Since I got

off that stuff...

His eye is on JAKE’s
drink... his anger
makes it possible
to screw up his
courage and mention
a very delicate
matter:

And speaking of which...
JAKE (who knows BILLY
is about to be censor-
ious about the liquor)
cuts in swiftly
knocking him off
balance:
JAKE
Wasn’t very smart, y’know -- poor-
mouthing like that in front of
Otterlake. Know who he is, Billy?
BILLY

Of course I do -- I’ve seen his
pictures --

FRANKL

Big hits, both of ‘em --
135

JAKE
(to MATT)

Tell him who he is, Uncle.
MATT

Brooksie’s old man owns half the
trees in Canada.

JAKE

And y'know what Billy told him? He
told him we’re in trouble.

BILLY
Well, aren’t we?
JAKE turns back to give
him another steady,

almost pitying look.

JAKE
(very patiently)

When we talk poor to the rich,
William, they jump to conclusions.
They think we’re getting ready for
a touch.

MAGGIE
(hushed)

And that’s what we're doing?
JAKE
That could have been the general

idea -- Till Uncle Billy loused it
up on us.
136

Poor BILLY turns away...
PISTER
(lurching out of
the shadows)
Mr. Hannaford --
PAT
No more questions, junior --
PISTER
As it happens, I did one of the
earliest really positive critical
appraisals --
MAGGIE
Well, horray for you.
PISTER

Well, he’s bound to feel some
gratitude --

JAKE
Brooksie Otterlake’s a chum...
(gently, friendly
-- but with a
delicate hint of
severity)

We don’t hustle our chums for dough,
kid. We’re kinda strict about that.
137

A tiny silence...

PISTER
(dumbfounded)

But, Mr. Hannaford -- !

JAKE
Yes, kid?
PISTER
Excuse me, but... didn’t I just hear

you saying --

JAKE
(patting PISTER
gently on the
cheek)
Always remember... that your heart

is God’s little garden...

He smiles at him and
ambles off into the
darkness... The others
trailing along after
him or drifting away in
different directions --
Except for MATT who
moves threateningly

up to the flabbergasted
PISTER:

MATT
That tape recorder running -- ?
PISTER

No...
138

MATT
Good.
PISTER
But there is a camera somewhere...

MATT turns sharply and
squints suspiciously into
the shadows... Seeing
nothing, he gives PISTER
another dirty look and
leaves...

ZIMMER’S VOICE

Don’t let it bother you...

FRESH ANGLE:

PISTER, turning near-
sightedly in the
direction of the voice,
finds ZIMMER standing
just behind him...

ZIMMER
Studying a man like Jake Hannaford --
that’s an experience. Don’t you
miss it. Stick with the job.
(dropping his
voice to a tone
at once confiden-
tial and reassuring)

Eat a little shit, Mr. Pister...

CUT TO:
139

ANOTHER PART OF THE TERRACE
Standing, rather uncertainly, in front of JAKE is
DOCTOR BURROUGHS. (If he’d been born earlier, DOCTOR
BURROUGHS would have been the last man in town to
give up spats:)

BILLY

Mr. Hannaford -- Doctor Bradley
Pierce Burroughs --

BURROUGHS
Pease.
JAKE
(with his brightest
smile)
Pease?
BURROUGHS
Bradley Pease Burroughs.
(nervous laugh)

Not that it matters!

(holding out his
hand)

How do you do, sir.

BILLY
The Doc here is a professor of
English Literature in the Framistan

Boarding Academy for Boys --

BURROUGHS
(correcting him)

Clivedale -- that’s the name of the
school...
140

BILLY
He also teaches dramatics.

BURROUGHS
(merrily)

And who do you think was my star
pupil? But of course, we knew him
then as “Oscar” --

JAKE

Oscar?

BILLY
(with a leer)

Tell about Aunt Daisy -- with the

funny hats.
BURROUGHS is becoming
increasingly aware of
the cameras.
BURROUGHS

I don’t know that they were funny...

BILLY
She raised him, you told me -- and
ever since the first day he could

walk --

CUT TO:

REVERSE ANGLE: ZARAH VALESKA

 

Standing apart watching the
curious little scene at some
distance.
ANOTHER ANGLE:

MAGGIE AND MATT

CUT BACK TO SCENE:

BURROUGHS treats JAKE
a smile compounded of
pity and

141

ZARAH VALESKA
(to OTTERLAKE)

What’s the point of this?
MATT’S VOICE (0.S.)
--. Putting on shows. All dressed

up in Auntie’s gowns and hats and
dresses --

MATT
(to MAGGIE)

And the way Dale tells it, he didn’t
even want to be an actor...

MAGGIE

Sure; that was supposedly Jake's
idea -- He practically forced him...

BURROUGHS’ VOICE (0.S.)
Down there in Acapulco...?
JAKE'S VOICE (0.S.)

Yes, what was he doing? I mean,
besides getting stoned --

to
142

C.U. BURROUGHS (CONT'D)
Affection for his old
student and the assurance
that JAKE will be
understanding.

BURROUGHS
(meaningfully)

He made the trip just to see you...

WIDER ANGLE:
JAKE
.--. And the change of name?
BURROUGHS

For that, I’m afraid, we’ll have to
blame Oscar Wilde.

JAKE
Do go on, Doctor.
BURROUGHS
Well -- we had this teacher... It was
one of those unpleasant little
scandals...
CUT TO: REVERSE ANGLES
ZARAH...she turns away.
MAGGIE and OTTERLAKE
JAKE'S VOICE (0.S.)

This teacher was a faggot?
CUT TO:

JAKE AND BURROUGHS

143

BURROUGHS’ VOICE (0.S.)
Well...

OTTERLAKE
Does all this matter?

MAGGIE
(thoughtfully)

I think it does to Jake...

BURROUGHS

Mr. Hannaford...

BURROUGHS, increasingly
uneasy about all these
busy camera surrounding

him, coughs and purses

his lips.

The story concerns my school: I’m
in no position to publish abroad a
petty --

JAKE
(over-lap)

Publish and be damned, Doctor. Look
-- they’ve run out of film -- you can
speak off the record...

This last is accompanied by
a quick glance (almost a
wink!) Into the lens of the

second camera which is

following...
A brief silence --

144

BURROUGHS is still flushed

with the excitement of

being the center of all
this attention, but by now
he’s feeling quite nervous
about the particular turn
this multi-media interview

is taking.

JAKE gives him his
steady “man to man”
look: (A good
equivalent to the
straight arm on the
shoulder).

BURROUGHS

Dale himself was in no way involved;
but among the boys, there was a good
deal of morbid conversation, I’m
afraid, on unhealthy subjects. As
you can imagine -- the name
“Oscar”...

JAKE
(in a tone of the most
perfect warmth and
understanding)
What happened to that teacher?
BURROUGHS
We let him go, of course.
JAKE
(still gently, but
closing the trap)

Let him go? What about the police?
145

BURROUGHS
(startled)

The police? The poor man was sick,
Mr. Hannaford.

JAKE

Those young boys -- they weren't sick
when he finished with ‘em?

(hardening)
That’s a prison offense, isn’t it --
How many minors do you have to

corrupt?

BURROUGHS
(shocked)

I hope you’re not worried about
Dale...

JAKE
You think I should be?
BURROUGHS

Wouldn’t that depend, Mr. Hannaford,
on your own personal interest?

JAKE
(after a very short
beat)
What are you driving at, Burroughs?

BURROUGHS

Why, nothing...
146

JAKE
(cutting him off)

I’m just his director, not his Aunt
Daisy.

BURROUGHS
And I’m just his English teacher!

(a self-conscious
little laugh)

JAKE looks at him
for a moment... (He’s
allowed the scene to
get a little out of
control; now he’s
going to get back on

top).

JAKE
(with the Hannaford
smile)

Right!

BURROUGHS
(pulling himself
together)

But certainly, he has every reason to
be grateful to you...

(archly)

And I’m sure that some day, when one
of his fine performances gets the
Academy Award, you'll be grateful
to him.
147

JAKE
(straight into camera)

Notice how careful he is not to refer
to it as an “Oscar.”

(back to BURROUGHS)
Doctor, would you care for a dip?
BURROUGHS

A dip...? In the pool? What a
grand suggestion!

JAKE
(turning away)

A little more hootch should be
helpful -- I’1l be right with you.

BURROUGHS
Good... Good. And where do I change?

JAKE
(turning back)

Here, Dr. Burroughs, in the sight of
God; I won’t even peek.

BURROUGHS
(absorbing this)

Yes...I suppose all school teachers
are prigs.

JAKE

I suppose so. Prigs and queers.
148

BURROUGHS
(archly)

Now, now, Mr. Hannaford --
JAKE

Now, now, Dr. Burroughs --

CU: OTTERLAKE

His reaction to this
curious little charade...

CUT TO:
149

ANOTHER ROOM SOMEWHERE IN THE HOUSE

C U: ZARAH VALESKA
JAKE'S VOICE
Big birthday surprise, eh, beautiful?
He has just entered
the scene... BILLY
and MAGGIE follow.
pause...
MAGGIE
She doesn’t know the latest...
(to ZARAH)
Remember the way they met -- when
Jake pulled Mr. John Dale out of the

water? The famous would-be suicide --

ZARAH
(flatly)

Would-be suicides ought to be treated
like drunks.

BILLY
(breaking in)

Would-be suicide, hell: --
JAKE

I was conned, Mother, it was a fake --
ZARAH

And it turns out that he doesn’t
belong to you?
150

JAKE'’s smile goes a
little blank.

MAGGIE
(antagonized)
Belong -- ?
ZARAH
The old Chinese business, remember?
You save a life -- you own that life.
JAKE

Finder keepers?
ZARAH
Do you care?
JAKE
Care? We’re free for a change, eh,
Uncle Bill...? Now we’ll have some

fun.

BILLY smiles gratefully...
MAGGIE is irritated:

MAGGIE
(to ZARAH)

Jake isn’t a Chinaman --
JAKE

“Chinese,” Maggie -- No, and the kid
wasn’t a suicide. He was... an actor.
151

He makes the last word
sound obscene... ZARAH
can’t help but notice
that his eyes are glazed
to avoid scrutiny, he
steps behind a screen

and finishes undressing...

ZARAH
(cutting her off)

We don’t own people.
MAGGIE

He wasn’t drowning -- he was
auditioning.

ZARAH

Or disown them. That boy didn’t run
away from you. He was thrown away.

MAGGIE

And sweet Holy Jesus, what a relief!
Like getting rid of a bad tooth --
Right, Jake?

JAKE
A monkey on my back --

He has stepped out from
behind the screen (dressed
now in a terry-cloth bath-
robe)... ZARAH’s look has
stopped him.

That means a drug habit, in case you
didn’t know, Mother... Sure --
something you gotta kick. And my foot
was getting sore...
152

ZARAH
How will you finish it?
JAKE

Finish what? He’s all washed up,
Mother --

ZARAH

The picture... Isn’t that what
matters?

JAKE
We'll finish it; eh, Maggie?
MAGGIE
Without the kid?
BILLY
We do have that footage of him
bringing the clothes to her...
through all that wind --
MAGGIE
To the girl?
JAKE
(after another beat,
unfocussed)
What about her?
JULIE RICH’S VOICE (0.S.)

Yes, what about her?
JULIE RICH comes
into scene.

Enter THE BARON...

153

JULIE RICH

We're all... interested.
(another beat)

JAKE
He wasn’t.

JULIE RICH
Neither are you... She doesn’t
interest you at all. Funny, isn’t
it?

MAGGIE

A scream.

JULIE RICH

I mean, look at the record -- the big
starmaker’s never been so big
females --

THE BARON
(holding up a
length of iron
pipe)

Present for you... Not from me --
Zimmer. There’s a card.

JAKE
(his back turned,
his eyes on ZARAH)

Zimmie? We oughta have a drink with
Zimmie...
154

THE BARON
You fired him.
JAKE
I always fire him.

(turning to THE
BARON)

Anyway, on my birthday I give the
presents.

THE BARON
It's some kind of gag --
(he sighs)
We know... You make the gags, too.

JAKE
(looking at the pipe)

He tells me where I can stick it?
THE BARON

It's for those plastic John Dales
that he made for you.

JULIE RICH

Things would have been different,
wouldn’t they, if Dale had been her
lover -- ?

MATT
(looking in at the
door )

I got an early day, Zarah, it’s been
a lovely party...
155

JULIE RICH
(still zooming in on
JAKE)
You couldn’t manage that -- It rather

spoils the pattern, doesn’t it?
MATT

What’s this pattern shit?

JULIE RICH
The big boss can tell you -- he knows
how it goes -- How it’s supposed to
go...

MATT

(after a beat)

Well, I’m going home -- What’s that

thing?
MAGGIE
(half to herself,
angrily turning
away )
Zimmie's jokes -- !
JAKE

Speaking of presents...

JAKE has been rummaging

in a drawer. He brings
something out and, turning
with it, is haulted again by
MATT’s voice reading from
ZIMMER'’s “birthday card”:
156

MATT
(reading)

“Have a go at the dummies, Jake --
they break even more easily than
people.”

After a moment’s pause,
JAKE turns again and
moves out to --

THE BIG ROOM

INTERCUT: REACTION SHOT
(INCLUDING THE ACTRESS)

JAKE
(making an
announcement )
Gentlemen -- and Ladies...

The clot of cameras
thickens quickly around
him...

We're presenting an award...

To the other half of “The Other Side
Of The Wind”... the better half.

A glint of alcohol in
his eye, he moves toward
THE ACTRESS.

A bone for Pocohontas...
The crowd watches in

uneasy silence (THE
ACTRESS very cool)...
He pauses for effect.

His eyes move to THE
ACTRESS.

157

JAKE (contd. )

A little curio we picked up somewhere
-- A bit of our own palefaced
craftsmanship: an Indian bone...

The inscription goes back before all
this was movie country. Just after
the gold was found. The redskin
population dropped pretty quickly
then -- ten years and ninety thousand
of ‘em just... disappeared. Well,

in those good old days, our gallant
honkey pioneers used to cut themselves
some heads off Indian skulls and
pickle the ears in whisky for
souvenirs --

And on bones, like this one, they
liked to write cute little jokes --

(reading the
inscription)

“I am off the reservation at last.”

And so you are, my dear...

He lays the bone down on
a table next to her quite
gently, and speaks quite

lightly.

CUT TO:

We thought you might want to give
this to your leading man -- right up
his ass.
158

SERIES OF SHORT SCENES (IMPROVISED)

Between carious types... including
some notable celebrities. All this
(like everything else) is recorded
by the documentary camera-crew,

and also video-freaks)...

As the party continues, the
generation gap is underscored

by the choice of intoxicants.
Guests anywhere near HANNAFORD’s
age are, of course, mostly on
booze... JAKE himself is quietly
putting it away in fairly Homeric
quantities...

At this stage, he certainly isn’t
sober.

(THE DWARVES are frankly drunk)...
159

THE GUN ROOM

 

A fine array of trophies, a
magnificent gun collection and
many framed photographs (groups

on safari and convivial gatherings
aboard the Hannaford yacht).

AL is studying one of the pictures.
It shows a handsome young man
tensely profiled in front of some
battered targets and clay pigeons.

AL
Who’s the joker with the cigarette?
THE BARON
Miguel -- He was the best of all.
AL
Best of what?
THE BARON
Our bullfighters, right, Jake? We
followed him for a while all over
Spain.
AL
(to JAKE, who has
just entered with

OTTERLAKE )

That’s you, aiming the gun at him in
the shooting gallery...
160

JAKE
Another birthday, kid. And what a
party that was -- No movie buffs or
bums, no spies or spooks. Just paid-
up members of The Club.
AL
(reading the sign-
ture on the photo)
Miguel Ortega?
THE BARON
The best.
AL
Didn't he get killed?
JAKE
Yep.
OTTERLAKE
(grinning as he
continues to
study the
photograph)

I hope you weren’t responsible for
that.

JAKE

I just got that one shot at him,
Brooksie, and I missed.
161

THE BARON

CBut he got the cigarette.

(he starts out
the door)

There was never any braver.

AL
(following THE BARON)

Not in a shooting gallery.

JAKE

No, he didn’t look too good in there.

OTTERLAKE
I guess he didn’t quite trust you --

(he breaks off,
with a quick
change of tone)

Drop that gun, Skipper.

JAKE has indeed, picked
out a rifle from his gun
collection.

If you're planning to celebrate this
birthday on me just --

JAKE

This is the one that hurts,
Brooksie...

(OTTERLAKE is so good at
dead-panning a gag that we
almost wonder if he does
imagine the old man is
proposing some sort of
lunatic duel?)
162

JAKE looks up at him,
as the young director
rises abruptly to his

feet.
Silence...
OTTERLAKE
Skipper --
JAKE

(cutting him off)

This is the scene we both hoped that
we'd never get to. And I don’t think
it’s going to play. Not even for
comedy.

He raises the gun and
sights along it,
pointing out the window
--. He pulls the trigger.
It clicks. The gun is
empty. He lowers it,
and turns, faintly
smiling to OTTERLAKE...

A short silence... Then:
OTTERLAKE
How much longer do you need?
JAKE
How much longer have you got?

OTTERLAKE tries to
answer...

JAKE gets up and leans
the gun against the
wall.
Silence...

Silence...

163

JAKE (contd. )
Hey -- remember when you first
appeared on that location of mine
up in Bolivia? What is it -- just
three years ago?
OTTERLAKE
(forcing a
chuckle)
I didn’t even have the fare back home,

just a second-hand tape recorder that
I couldn’t work --

JAKE

A raggedy-ass kid...

OTTERLAKE
Skipper...

JAKE
Yeah?

OTTERLAKE

That forty million that was
mentioned...

JAKE
I know, kid; let me finish your line
for you. It’s still only a distant
hope...

How’s that for dialogue?
164

He grins at him and moves
into the bathroom.

JAKE'S VOICE
(from the bathroom)

You might just lean a little on Max
David... You do the leaning, he’s
gotta give.
OTTERLAKE
I did set up the screening --
JAKE'S VOICE
So you did... He hated every frame --
OTTERLAKE
He was confused...
JAKE'S VOICE
Sure.
OTTERLAKE

He’s an idiot, Jake. You know that.
They're all idiots.

JAKE'S VOICE
He’s your idiot.
OTTERLAKE
Up to a point.
JAKE'S VOICE
Don’t be pompous, kid...
Not that I don’t understand. You

made the company all that loot.
Christ knows I didn’t.
165

OTTERLAKE

Don’t think I’m not going to put up
a fight about it. I will.

JAKE comes to the door.

JAKE looks at him...

He starts raising
the gun...

CUT TO:

JAKE
But you don’t want to.
OTTERLAKE
I don’t want to have to listen to

Max and the rest of those stupid
sods turning you down...

We'll find a way... You know that,
don’t you?

JAKE

Don’t give up the ship, Davey...?
OTTERLAKE

I’m not -- !
JAKE

Didn't I tell you -- ? This scene
will never play...
166

THE ROW OF DUMMIES ON THE ROCKS
(placed earlier in neat
arrangement by ZIMMER)...

The head of one of them is
suddenly hit by a bullet and
destroyed.

INTERCUT: JAKE AT THE WINDOW

Firing...

THE TERRACE

THE ACTRESS sits alone on one of
them. (We are across the pool from
the firing lines where the dummies
are still getting blown to smithereens
by the sportsmen in the window of the
gun room. )

HIGGAM enters scene.

HIGGAM
(out of sorts)

I’ve been looking for you...
She turns to look at him.
HIGGAM (contd. )

Your boss sent me --

C.U.: THE ACTRESS

Not liking that word
"boss"...

HIGGAM’S VOICE (0.S.)

I’m supposed to give you this --
167

TWO SHOT FAVORING HIGGAM:
Holding out a gun...
THE ACTRESS
Another present?
HIGGAM

How do I know? He just told me that
he thinks you’1l know how to use it.

Rising and taking the
gun from him, she looks
dangerous... HIGGAM
beats a hasty retreat.

She then raises the gun,
turning to aim it
directly away from the
row of dummies...
JAKE'S AT THE WINDOW
His eyes are on THE ACTRESS
OTTERLAKE
(from a place of
safety)

Who’s she aiming at?

JAKE
(after a beat)

Me.
A shot rings out, and

the lantern nearest to
JAKE shatters to pieces.
168

OTTERLAKE
Hey -- !
JAKE
(falling into the
hammy style of
their game)
Otterlake -- we never should have

issued firearms to the natives.

Another shot! And
another lantern breaks.
The group is practically
blacked out.

THE ACTRESS

 

She turns her gun slightly,
taking careful aim --

THE DUMMIES ON THE ROCKS:
Getting their plaster heads
blown off!!

INTERCUT: JAKE, OTTERLAKE AND THE BARON
Each with a gun, firing blithely away...

SERIES OF SHOTS: REACTIONS FROM VARIOUS GUESTS

A QUICK FLASH: DOCTOR BURROUGHS

Mother naked, scuttling frantically out of range
of the flying bullets.

BILLY

She’s nuts! She’s going to wreck the
whole damn party --
169

ZARAH VALESKA

Jake’s done that already.

CUT TO:

Suddenly --

Out of the blackness, a bolt of bright raspberry colored
lightning (!!!) Reveals the Hannaford Ranch, the Western
landscape surrounding it, and DR. BURROUGHS, crouched
behind cactus, a trembling nude... The scattered dummies

on the rocks look like an over-exposed negative of some
unthinkable massacre...

The lightning changes color -- luridly, repeatedly, and the
night is hideously assaulted with noise.

What has commenced, of course, is a display of fireworks.
An important display -- if a bit in spirit... Guests are
surprised in various attitudes and positions...
170

A mighty boom (!!!)
from some larger and
louder firework.

PISTER
What was that?

OTTERLAKE
(as PATTON)

Artillery. The heavy
stuff.

A new -- a really
terrific detonation!!!

The women-folk’s all safe in
the stockade?

PISTER
(just beginning
to dig)

One of them’s been shooting
at me --

THE ROOF

Tiny figures, like demons
from hell, can be seen on
top of the house scuttling
madly about in the smoke
and flame...

CUT TO:

THE FRONT OF THE RANCH HOUSE

OTTERLAKE
(his Blimp
character)

My God, Hannaford -- there are
lots of them -- little men up
there -- shooting Roman
candles on the roof!
QUICK FLASHES:

GUESTS REACTING...

171

OTTERLAKE (contd. )
(changing voices)

Veteran troops, old boy --
Neo-realistics.

(another voice)

And the grand, old New Wave,
sir. They’1ll never give up!

 

(Spooked or bored, put

off or turned on --

according to age group
and individual temperament)...

MORE FLASHES:

Exploding bouquets of
light... wheels of

colored flame..
of white fire...

AL

Look -- that sweet old lady in the
tennis shoes --

PISTER
(looking wildly
around)
Where?
AL

(sharply correcting
him)

Y’mean who.
172

AL (contd. )
(then, with lowered
voice -- confidentially)
Governor Reagan -- that’s who!
OTTERLAKE

(rapid transition
from guardsman to
Kiplingesque Tommy)

Blimy -- ! This is ruddy war!

AL
(as a newscaster)

Approached by a video-freak with an
indecent suggestion (just as he was
sneaking over the State line) Ronald’s
wig slipped.

(aside to JAKE)
Is he still Governor, governor?

OTTERLAKE
(grim)

Whatever he is, Ronnie’s decreed a
state of emergency and thrown himself
on the mercy of Central Casting.

 

Another tremendous
explosion!

AL
(turning to the
bewildered PISTER to
issue a grave warning)

They're bringing up their
symposiums...
173

AL (contd. )
(into his ear,
with urgency)

Critical appraisals, Pister --
in depth.

OTTERLAKE
(voice change)

The rot has set in, Pister.
Five of our own best
biographers have gone over to
Preminger.

(another change)

They shall be stripped of
their footnotes.

Another burst of fire-
works... something
huge --

PISTER
(in a TIGHT C.U.)

No, really -- ! Something seems
to have caught fire --

OTTERLAKE
(Nixon)

Extremists from the Film
Institute -- They’ve wrapped
themselves in the grand old
silver nitrate celluloid, and
set themselves aflame.

AL
But what of Jane Fonda?
OTTERLAKE
(a gentle pious

confidence to PISTER)

She’s watching us, kid -- up
there...
So magnetic is his

personality -- or so

174

befuddled in his victim --

that PISTER actually

glances for a moment at

the fiery heavens.

BILLY AND THE BARON

AL

Now it can be told: at the
outset of hostilities, Saint
Jane was burnt at the stake...

OTTERLAKE
(yet another
voice)

She has appeared since on
Dick Cavett, and twice, ina
vision, to Duke Wayne.

They have been joined now by an
interested Scottish film critic.

THE SCOTTISH FILM CRITIC
Fond of fireworks, is he?
THE BARON
(more interested
than distressed)
Mr. Hannaford? He adores them...
THE SCOTTISH FILM CRITIC
(his eyes now on
the roof)

And those technicians -- are they
really professionals?

BILLY

Professionals? They’re
midgets!
175

THE SCOTTISH FILM CRITIC
(making the sound of
one who hopes he has
understood everything)

Ah...

THE PARKING SPACE IN FRONT OF THE RANCH
OTTERLAKE has one of those
battery-powered megaphones
used on movie sets. He is
directing it upwards towards
the beleaguered ranch house...
OTTERLAKE
“Antinyoneeyeyonee-oh!!"
PISTER
What?
OTTERLAKE

The war-cry. They’re dropping
over Burbank like ripe plums --

AL
(under his breath to
PISTER)
Pass it along -- Godard has just set

up a government-in-exile in Pomona.
A deafening explosion --
A blinding flash of red
light!!!
OTTERLAKE

Well, if Bascalucci doesn’t
surrender now --
The whole sky has now

AL
(correcting his chief)
Bertolucci.
OTTERLAKE

(expansively)

Slice him how you want him,
he’s gonna be one spicy meatball.

turned fiercely scarlet.
OTTERLAKE raises a pair
of binoculars to study

the field.

OTTERLAKE (contd. )
(yet another voice --
the Voice of Doom)

Wayne himself -- now a barefoot
friar -- has just been arrested

for denigrating all over a

Daughter Of The American Revolution!

Jessel is demanding equal
time.
FRESH ANGLE:

JAKE has moved ahead;
be seen climbing into
brand-new sports car.

177

he can
a beautiful,

OTTERLAKE (contd. )
(in his own voice,
to AL)

I wonder if our leader has any
idea who that belongs to --

AL
(lowering his voice
as some other people
start moving down the
steps toward the parking
lot)
He bought it...

OTTERLAKE
(incredulous)

What -- ?
AL
It was going to be for Dale --
OTTERLAKE
Wow.
AL
We weren’t giving much salary,
so he would have got that as a

bonus when he finished the
picture.
178

OTTERLAKE
He didn't, so he doesn’t...
AL
And that’s the way it is.
Cronkite is hastily
abandoned as OTTERLAKE
starts towards JAKE.
Let him go --

He drives like a maniac when he’s
sober.

OTTERLAKE

Ah, but here’s a lady tells us that
we've gotta stick together...
Jake and I --

He’s referring, of course,
to JULIE RICH who has come
forward out of the ranch
house and is steadily
approaching...

JULIE RICH
Close -- very close.
OTTERLAKE

Too late now, he got away from
me...

He starts toward the car
(AL moves off toward his)
... Then OTTERLAKE stops --
179

He turns... and moves
back to her.

OTTERLAKE (contd. )

And what the hell is that
about?

JULIE RICH

The farther you’re apart,
the harder it will be to hide.

JAKE starts up the
sports car with a great
roar and some erratic
clashing of gears...
swerves wildly into
the main road... and
races off toward the
drive-in theatre.

OTTERLAKE

Now what could we be hiding
from you, lady?

JULIE RICH
From yourselves --

How much you really hate each
other.

Deathly silence...

In the background, AL

is seen to raise his
megaphone (he has decided --
mistakenly -- to continue
with another gag).
180

AL
(newscasting over
his loud-hailer)
Now here’s a late bulletin --
Marlon Brando (who, by the way,
folks -- is not pregnant) has
gone underground and is doing
splendid work for all of us under
the name of Tokyo Rose.
He has quite an audience now
among the parked cars in front
of the ranch, but nobody
laughs...
After a short pause he lowers

the megaphone and turns to
look at OTTERLAKE:

Chin up, Brooksie, they haven’t got
us yet!

Another pause...
OTTERLAKE
You’ve got it wrong, lady.
JULIE RICH
Yes?
OTTERLAKE

Yes, just slightly wrong.

CUT TO:
181

THE BARON
What happened to Jesus?

THE SCOTTISH FILM CRITIC
Jesus -- ?

THE CRITIC is taking care
that nothing shall escape
his attention: BILLY’S
distress by now is moving
towards despair; but the
elderly Hungarian, as
always, is indestructably
urbane.

BILLY
He’s stoned out of his head --

THE BARON
(to the CRITIC)

A Mexican chum of ours.
Almost blind, but he still
makes our fireworks.

BILLY

Forty years with J.J. Hannaford,
and the old fart still doesn’t
know any English!

THE DRIVE-IN THEATRE

The last act begins
(as did act two) with --

A BLANK MOVIE SCREEN

Standing lonely in the
desert country, it jumps
out of the darkness under
the sudden swoop of head-
lights...

Then --

HANNAFORD'S FILM IS PROJECTED

The images paling at first
under the headlights of
arriving cars. There aren't
too many of these (not too
many have been told about
this emergency screening).

NOW THE FILM PROCEEDS FORMALLY,
AND WITHOUT INTERRUPTION...
183

A title:
MEANWHILE ——
BACK AT THE RANCH ...

A flashlight’s beam, crossing
a few remnant patches of the
birthday party, has come to
rest on a piece of black
illustration board. Upon this,
in the style of an old silent
movie title, some wit has
scrawled the words we've just
been reading...

We are, indeed, back the ranch,
and in --

THE BIG ROOM

 

Among the litter, an idle scattering
of photographers are still idiotically
photographing each other... The guests
are stoned, discursive of both.

Somebody snatches the illustration
board from somebody else.

VOICES

“Hey, who gave you that?
It’s part of the story board.”

"The what?”

"Come on -- I’1l show you...”

THE “STORY BOARD ROOM”

We've been in this room before --
184

THE “STORY BOARD ROOM” (CONT'D)

-- caught glimpses of the drawings
on the wall during one or another
of the lamp-lit conversations...
The sketches are for set-ups to

be photographed for HANNAFORD’S
FILM. These illustrate the action...
INTERCUT CLOSE SHOTS of these are
INTERCUT with the FILM itself
(being shown on the screen of the
drive-in-theatre) and with the
following dialogue...

From a tape recorder comes an
unaccompanied Flamenco lament.
MAGGIE and BILLY are doing their
valiant best to explain their
sketches to a small group of
truth-seekers.

HIGGAM’S VOICE

--. This old man is hiding -- spying

on her?

AL'S VOICE

Yes, but then she chases him,
remember?

MAGGIE’S VOICE

He finally holes up in some
old wreck of a movie prop --

PAT’S VOICE
(breaking in)

And now she’s pushing all this crazy
shit around, you see -- trying to
close the guy in, when a whole lot
more of it collapses --
185

BILLY’S VOICE

That’s being worked out.
PAT’S VOICE

So now this character is trapped --
AL'S VOICE

But then we hear his voice --
HIGGAM'S VOICE

The singing?
PAT’S VOICE

Old Manolito -- Jake always tries to
get him a job.

BILLY
(on camera)

But he won’t play the part --

MAGGIE
(on camera)

It won't be any midget, either.
PISTER
(the intelligent
truth-seeker)

But who is he?
186

MAGGIE

See the movie...

THE FILM:

The VOICES continue
off-screen:

PISTER
What does he represent?
PAT

Aw, just some screwy old squatters out
there in the back-lot of a studio --

DELLA
But what’s he doing in the story -- ?
MAGGIE

You’1l have to ask Mr. Hannaford.
JACQUELINE
But will he tell us?
Silence...
THE FILM continues:

(THE ACTRESS on the
screen alone)...

JACQUELINE’S VOICE

How about asking her -- ?
HANNAFORD’S_ FILM

Continues...

187

PISTER’S VOICE
(under his breath)

What if... he’s Hannaford --
Hannaford himself?

BILLY'S VOICE

Don’t be nuts.

INTERCUT: THE FILM ITSELF AND VARIOUS GROUPS WATCHING IT.

Sometimes we can see these
people -- mostly they are
voices over THE FILM...

We are in --

THE DRIVE-IN THEATRE

HIGGAM'S VOICE
Let’s back up a little -- The wind
it’s blowing the old movie set to
pieces.

DANNY'S VOICE

The whole world maybe...
188

KLEE’S VOICE
(over-lap)

It's just a wrecking job, there were
machines --

ROGER’S VOICE
And what about that blood on her...?
KLEE’S VOICE
Blood?
OSSIE’S VOICE
Her body --
BLACK CINEASTE’S VOICE

Whatever we're supposed to think,
there’s death in it...

THE BARON’S VOICE
My dear fellow...

BLACK CINEASTE’S VOICE
Man, that’s all it is -- death it’s
just purely what he’s all about --

CUT TO:

A_GROUP_ GATHERED AROUND THE BLACK CINEASTE’S CAR...

BLACK CINEASTE
(on camera)

Like Simon says, under the shell he’s
all mushy...
189

THE BARON
That’s mushy talk, brother.
THE BLACK CINEASTE

(to the others,
indicating THE BARON)

Who’s he?
ANOTHER CINEASTE
(pink)
“The Baron” -- That’s what they call

him.
OSSIE

Well, he is a baron.
KLEE

And he’s on all the credits for Jake’s
screenplays.

THE BARON
(ice-cool, with no
trace of self-pity)

I muse Mr. Hannaford. He has curious
pleasures --

OSSIE

Oh? We'd like to hear some more about
those curious pleasures...
190

THE BARON

Games. He likes to play games...
I am a writer who stopped writing one
afternoon in Budapest in nineteen
twenty nine. Do I have a camera?

All through the evening
people have been
forgetting the cameras,
or trying to, or pretend-
ing to try... Now THE
BARON is actually looking
for one.

I am prepared to make a limited
declaration.

(he pauses, getting
his thoughts
together)

This famous... old lion of yours --
he is not what you think, you know.

OSSIE
Who called him a lion for God’s sake?
JACQUELINE

Lions are cats. Chabrol says he’s a
cat --

CHABROL

Jake is a cat that walks like a bear.
191

BLACK CINEASTE

Or a lobster -- ? That walks like a
crab, sidewise...

THE BARON
You made the mask. Tear it off now
and what will you find? -- Another
mask. Or your own face...

OSSIE
Another mask?

THE BARON
Your own face, perhaps.

MANNY

A trick -- done with mirrors... Sorry
go on, Baron. What’s the answer?

DANNY

A magician doesn’t give any answers --
THE BARON

I’d call him a necromancer.

But I do not know if he has raised
the dead.
THE DRIVE-IN

192

JAKE, in the sports car,
sits watching the FILM...

OTTERLAKE, standing not far
away, turns to another car,
as it pulls to a stop...

Silence...

The FILM continues...

OTTERLAKE
(indicating the
screen)
Dad's done it again, hasn’t he?
"Be-dimm'd the noon-tide sun;
Call’d forth the mutinous winds.
By his so potent art...
But this... rough magic He here
abjures --"
(change of tone)

Take back the last: it doesn’t
fit...

JAKE

What does “abjure” mean? You
went to Harvard.

OTTERLAKE
“Give-up -- “
JAKE

That’s a suggestion?
193

OTTERLAKE
(to the others)

“Abjure” -- give up... he knows
what it means.

JAKE
I gave up on the seventh grade.
OTTERLAKE
Never. Not even then... And I
didn’t learn my Shakespeare in

Harvard.

JAKE
(to the others)

Mr. Otterfield wanted to be an actor --
Then he saw one of my movies --

We all read the interview...

OTTERLAKE
(to the others)

It can also be stated that we aren’t
breaking any magic wands...

(No reaction from the listening
group in the car.)

Wands... You’ve heard the Baron on
that subject? “Every man needs
two -- his own and a good one.”

He’ll be hanging onto his for awhile
longer --

JAKE

Hang onto your own, baby -- just for
once.
A long silence...

CUT TO:

194

OTTERLAKE
(camping)

He is a rough magician, isn’t he?

What did I do wrong, Daddy?

“Our revels now are ended..."?
JAKE

You bet your sweet cheeks.
195

THE ACTRESS

 

She sits alone, watching
the film...

(INTERCUT: THE FILM)
JAKE'S CAR

JULIETTE RICH has nudged her way
past OTTERLAKE and stands next to
JAKE, who sits still at the wheel
of his open car...

She stands there looking at him...

There has been the muted noise of an
expensive car coming to a stop. (Per-
haps we caught a glimpse of it in the
background)...

Now, suddenly, JULIE RICH starts back,
startled, as JAKE, with that feline
agility of his which can be so sur-
prising, jumps out of the car.

The last lurking CAMERA CREW follows
him as he moves over to:

ZARAH'S CAR

 

THE FILM’S sound-track fills the pause

as these two legendary figures, these

famous friends confront each other...
JAKE

Hey, Beautiful...
196

The banal words of the
greeting seem to carry
the vibration of many
years of affectionate
repitition.
JAKE (contd. )
Going so soon...?
ZARAH doesn’t speak.

Wasn’t much fun for you, was it...?
--. Goddam midgets...

ZARAH

They’re friends of yours?

JAKE
Just brought ‘em along for laughs,
Mother.

ZARAH
I see.

JAKE
Casting call... Some cockamamy
notion that the Old Man oughta be a
dwarf. In the movie... Don’t
you think it’s better if we never
see him?

Her eyes have gone to the
distant screen...

For a moment we share her
viewpoint:
197

Then --

BACK TO SCENE:
JAKE'S VOICE (0.S.)

That goes for us all, doesn’t it --
all the old men...

BACK TO SCENE

JAKE waits... ZARAH
makes no comment.

Now he makes a sour
little joke (a faint
note of something close
to defensiveness which
we've never heard from
him before).

JAKE

Heard but not seen, huh? And for
the sex department... work quickly
and always in the dark.

He realizes that this has
fallen very flat... even
before he’s aware that
OTTERLAKE is standing at
his side.

OTTERLAKE
(comic Japanese)

So sorry, Sarah --
(as himself)

I’m afraid our leader is a little
pissed.
198

JAKE

She doesn’t like you, kid: that’s
why she gave the party. She doesn’t
figure I get quite enough exposure
from the younger generation just from
you...

But I do, you know. I get quite
enough.

A short, tense silence...
Then OTTERLAKE turns and
leaves...

Silence again between
these two...

And now, in the FILM, the
lamenting wind is conquered
by the song of the OLD MAN...

JAKE (contd. )

That's old Manolito. We found him
together... In Spain, remember...?

She goes on listening for
just a while longer to the
old gypsies’ song...

Hey, beautiful, couldn’t we fix it
to see each other just a little bit
less seldom.

ZARAH
With an old friend, it’s quite enough

to feel he’s there -- like Gibraltar
or the Eiffel Tower...

 
JAKE absorbs this for
moment. Then she
continues:

199

JAKE
Thanks, Mother...
ZARAH

Durability -- it can be rather
fragile.

Sometimes, to keep that feeling we
need to keep our distance.

a

The bad thing is to find out that a
friendship was between a couple of
other people.

Say goodnight for me to your actress.

INTERCUT: THE ACTRESS

JAKE
(still trying to
keep it bright)

She’s not too happy with us, either...

Well -- she was pretty good in there
with the gun.
200

JULIE RICH

She didn’t shoot at the dummies --

JAKE doesn’t turn at
her approach: he goes
on looking at ZARAH.

JAKE
(the faint, hopeful
smile is still frozen
on his face -- but no
smile is in his voice)
The preferred target, I guess, would
have been me.

JULIE RICH

Preferred by you, Mr. Hannaford?

A short, ugly pause...

Then:

You gave her the gun...

ZARAH
(suddenly
exasperated)

What does that mean?

(Whatever has happened to
her feelings about JAKE,
here is a rat of a women,
deserving nothing, on whom
she can allow a bit of
pressure to escape).

What’s it supposed to mean?
201

JAKE
(ruefully)

Don’t worry, even if she doesn’t
know, she’1l tell us.

(For just this moment, we’re
encouraged to believe that
the young lady critic has
nothing to say... But we’re

wrong)

JULIE RICH
(speaking gently
and quickly)

Miss Valeska, you made just one
picture with Hannaford?

ZARAH
(blank)

Yes.
JULIE RICH
Garvey was your leading man. Glen
Garvey... It is true, isn’t it, that
during the shooting, Hannaford had an
affair with Garvey’s wife?
ZARAH
(after a short, deadly
pause)

We'll have to stop this, you know.

This last refers to the
DOCUMENTARY CAMERA CREW
(of whose busy presence
she has been increasingly

aware).
202

JULIE RICH
(rapidly building to
her climax, her
eyes still riveted
on JAKE)

Men are the subject of his movies --
Whoever the man is, naturally, he has
a woman -- Whoever she is -- somehow,
finally, Hannaford seduces her. He
must. He must possess her. That way,
he possesses him...

BILLY'S VOICE (0.S.)
(wearily)

Okay, okay... Cut it, you guys --

That’s just what happens:

the film (the documentary
film of this action) ends,
abruptly, like the turning
off of a light.

Replacing it --

A “STILL” PHOTOGRAPH OF THE GROUP

(Taken by some last, lurking
spy among the journalists.)

But if the movie camera has
stopped, the SOUND-TRACK is
still recording, and we hear --

JULIE RICH’S VOICE
Expensive vice, isn’t it? When he’s

had his actor’s girl, he throws her
away. And then, of course, he’s
203

JULIE RICH’S VOICE (contd.)

Thrown away his actor, and
destroyed him in the process...

Perhaps that’s what he really
wants --

A_hard slap!

The unmistakable sound
of JAKE’s sudden, brutal
attack...

A FLASH from a hand-held
camera, roughly turned on
again, and showing us
nothing clear... only
wild confusion and a
strong impression of
violence --

AL'S VOICE
(under his breath)

They're getting all of this, you
know -- on film...

BILLY'S VOICE

Who gives a shit? What’s their
public, for Chrissake? -- Before
one of those creeps can put this
stuff together we’ll have our
movie out. A real movie...

(he breaks off --)

Silence... (or some-

thing close to it)...

From the FILM still run-
ing on the big screen --
there comes a faint sighing
of wind...

CUT TO:
204

 

THE RANCH
Dawn -- very early, very
grey...

The last of the cars are
pulling out of the drive-
way and heading for home.

The house itself would
seem to be deserted.

CALB (the general handy-
man) is searching the
empty, littered rooms,
calling out an occasional
“Mr. Hannaford -- “ as he
goes...

Silence answers him...

THE RANCH

 

Dawn -- very early and
very grey...

The last of the cars pulls
out of the driveway heading
for home...

The house itself would seem
to be deserted. CALB (the
general handyway) is
searching the littered rooms,
calling an occasional
“Mister Hannaford” -- as he
goes...

Silence at first...
Then a murmuring can be

heard somewhere in the
house.
205

JAKE'S VOICE

--- Old friends are old, and
that’s the trouble with ‘em...

 

(This is, in fact,

the continuation of
some talk between JAKE
and VOGEL, the start
which we heard early
last night, and which
had been recorded. )

JAKE'S VOICE (contd. )

They don’t grow old -- it’s just
something they stumble over and
fall into. And they all seem so...
surprised.
Poor sods -- they look at you as
though there was something you
could do about it...

CALB goes searching...

through the house and out

onto the terrace by the

pool... But JAKE’S VOICE

grows fainter...

(But there is someone else

here) ...

CUT TO:

THE DRIVE-IN THEATRE
Almost empty now...
OTTERLAKE
Hey, Billy --
BILLY

Hey, Brooksie --
206

OTTERLAKE

What happened to the critic
lady?

BILLY
She'll live --
AL
She'll live to write about it.
BILLY
Fuck her.
OTTERLAKE

Almost everybody’s gone, looks
like... Zarah, too?

BILLY
She left.
OTTERLAKE
(with just a whiff
of JAKE in his
tone)
So she did, uncle, so she did...
Maybe she don’t love us like she used
to.
BILLY
Maybe...

Don’t let him get you down,
Brooksie.
207

OTTERLAKE

Do you?
BILLY

Not yet. Not quite.
OTTERLAKE

We’re hanging tough, Billy.

-.. Let’s see if we can get a

laugh out of him --
He turns and looks
toward the place where

JAKE is sitting along
in the sports car...

CUT TO:

THE FILM

 

It plays for a time...
Then we hear:
JOHN DALE’S VOICE

Morning, Hannaford.

CUT TO:

THE THEATRE GATE

 

JAKE'S car lurches to a stop...

JOHN DALE'S figure -- unmistak-
able in its raincoat and with
the curly ash-blonde hair, is
in the foreground...

JAKE peers at him through the
murky light...
208

JAKE
Johnny -- ?
No answer.
Came to my party after all --
JOHN DALE’S VOICE
I came to get my car, Hannaford.

JAKE
(after a silence)

Get in. I’11 drive you...

JOHN DALE’S VOICE

No, thanks.
Another silence...
JAKE
Chicken -- ?

There is no reply...

After a long moment,
JAKE turns away, puts
his foot on the pedal
and, with a frantic
screeching of tires,
the car swerves out
through the gates and
off down the highway...

REVERSE ANGLE:

It was the voice of John
Dale, but it was not

John Dale. OTTERLAKE

takes off the wig.

(Much earlier we've seen him
idly picking it from the

head of one of the dummies)...
209

OTTERLAKE

I’m better than I think...
And much less funny --

He tosses the wig to
MAVIS, who utters a
tiny whine of disgust
upon receiving it.
Ripping off the rain-
coat which had completed
his disguise, he climbs
into his car.

Come on, sweetie...

The old man didn’t get to make
it with you, did he, so who
does that mean you’re going
home with? According to the
critic lady, with a virgin.

He starts the car...

CUT TO:

The real JOHN DALE...

THE RANCH

Moving through the empty house...
The voice of the handyman

be heard calling again:

“Mr. Hannaford...”

Silence at first.

Then the murmuring from another
room...
210

JAKE'S VOICE

.-.. Remember those Berbers -- up
in the Atlas? They wouldn't

let us point a camera at ‘em.
They’re certain that it...

dries up something...

Following the sound,
JOHN DALE moves into --

THE BIG ROOM

Here, sprawled in a huge
leather chair, HIGGAM is
sleeping, his tape recorder
on his lap...

JAKE'S VOICE (CONT’D)

The old eye, you know, behind the
magic box. Could be it’s an
evil eye, at that...

Medusa’s...

CUT TO:

THE DRIVE-IN THEATRE

A deserted field, except
for THE ACTRESS sitting
alone in her little car...

The wailing wind and the
gypsy song on the theatre’s
sound track are joined now
by the wailing of police
sirens -- heard very
distantly...

The sky is clear enough to
show the hint of a black
pillar of smoke somewhere
far off...
211

JAKE'S VOICE

Who knows, maybe you can stare
too hard at something. Huh? --
Drain out the virtue -- suck out
the living juice...

ON THE SCREEN -—

The moving images fade
under the dead pallor
of the rising day...

THE ACTRESS starts up
her car and drives
away.

JAKE'S VOICE (contd. )

You shoot the great places and
the pretty people -- All those girls
and boys...

Shoot ‘em dead...

The air is lightening;
morning is almost here;
the sun is just under the
horizon, and JAKE’S FILM
is very faint now on the
big screen...

THE GIRL seems like a
ghost as she returns to
the shapeless wreck which
is all that’s left of the
OLD MAN'S dwelling place.

For a moment longer --

dim as the image itself --
there rises from somewhere
beneath this ruin the

gypsy lament... But already
the wind ius blowing it away...

Blowing everything away...
212

Layer after layer flies off
into the sky... And ten, as
the great dust cloud settles,
there is nothing -- only a
vast lunar emptiness...

And silence...
JAKE'S VOICE (contd. )
(on the sound track
of the projected
film)
Cut.

The image disappears from
the screen.

The movie is over.
