EXT. WEST TEXAS HIGH DESERT - DAY

A barren landscape that stretches forever, flat-topped mesas
in the distant background. No buildings, no people...only a
lonely wind that stirs the dust from the desert floor

JIMMY (V.0.)
There is a story told in the town of Big
Lake, Texas. A story of the town’s
beginnings...

An ancient OIL RIG comes into view; long since dried up, with
tumbleweeds choking its foundation.

JIMMY (V.O,) (CONT'D)

It is the story of the Santa Rita number
one, the birthplace of west Texas oil. As
with most oil legends, there was a man
who believed oil was right beneath his
feet, and, as with most oil legends,
there was no one who believed him.

The wind swirls the dust higher, and as it settles...
~ 2 EXT. WEST TEXAS VISTA ~ DECADES AGO
...TWO NUNS, each holding a BASKET OF YELLOW ROSE PETALS.
JIMMY (V.0.)
Except, in this case, for two nuns, who
in 1923 believed in the man’s dream and
were willing to invest money no one knew
they had. Their priest shook his head and
offered only one small piece of advice.
The nuns toss a handful cf the petals high into the sky.
JIMMY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Bless the site with rose petals of yellow
and invoke the help of Saint Rita, the
patron saint of impossible dreams.

The petals flutter to the ground...and in the background.

3 EXT. DUSTY BASEBALL FIELD - DECADES AGO

...€@ BASEBALL FIELD, more accurately a patch of dirt. Oil
workers are playing a baseball game...and playing well.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED: 3

JIMMY (V.0.) f
And while the workers waited for the oil ‘
that would eventually come, they played
baseball.

The workers --- dirty, no uniforms ~-- turn a double play.

JIMMY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Played baseball so well that some were
able to give up the dirt and the despair,
and went on to play major league ball in
the glory days of Ruth and Gehrig.

The oil worker tosses a pitch and the batter HITS IT high,
very high, into the air.

And while the ball flies lazy in the dusty air, the blue sky

turns. gray and the dust turns into snowflakes.
JIMMY (V.0.) (CONT'D)

I've told that story many times. The
blessing, the baseball, the dreams. Never
knowing...that I was really telling it to
myself.
TITLE: BASED ON A TRUE STORY
The ball begins to settle...
EXT. CONNECTICUT - DAY 4

..-and it's caught by a YOUNG BOY in the snow-covered front
yard of his home.

JIMMY MORRIS, 12, stands on a pitching mound of snow, ready bl
to throw another pitch.

TITLE: GROTON, CONNECTICUT 1973 *
YOUNG JIMMY
(whispering the play by play)
First game in the big leagues...and Jimmy
Morris has a no-hitter going...
His FRIEND, a snow-covered catcher, is already complaining...
SNOW-COVERED CATCHER
Jimmy, don‘t throw it so hard. My hands

are cold.

Jimmy unloads a fastball and the catcher ducks out of the -
way. The ball disappears into the snow. (

YOUNG JIMMY
Hey! Whatcha doin’?!

SNOW-COVERED CATCHER
Waitin’ till spring. That's what I’m
doin’.

Jimmy's mother, OLLINE (goes by Ollie), LATE 20'S, calls out
from the side door.

OLLIE
Jimmy!
(he turns)
Your father and I need to talk to you.

The joy of the moment, of playing in the snow, is gone. Jimmy
knows the news won't be good.

YOUNG JIMMY
(to his friend)
See ya

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Jimmy sits at the kitchen table; his younger brother, KAEL,
8, a few feet away

Jimmy’s father, JIM SR., 30, NAVY THROUGH AND THROUGH, stands
military upright, sipping coffee as he looks out at the snow.
When he turns to look at Jimmy, Jimmy realizes he still has
his cap and on and removes it lest he feel his father‘s
wrath.

Ollie sets a cup of hot chocolate in front of Jimmy --

OLLIE
I hear Virginia's real nice

~~ then positions herself at the end of the room next to her
husband.

OLLIE (CONT'D)
Least that‘s what the Navy folks told
your dad...isn‘t that right Jim?

Jim Sr. continues to stare out the window.

YOUNG JIMMY
We'll just be movin’ again.

Ollie doesn’t want it getting worse. She says to her son...

OLLIE (CONT'D)

snow down there.

6 INT. BEDROOM ~- NIGHT

Late at night. Jimmy is in his bed, tossing a baseball into
the air...catching it as it falls back.

YOUNG JIMMY
Jimmy Morris...with another masterful
pitching performance...

He holds the ball for a second, silently, and as he starts to
toss it again...

YOUNG JIMMY (CONT‘D)
.--.well on his way...

The ball rises in the darkness, reaching its peak, and a blue
sky becomes the background. It falls into...

bit by too many hard pitches. He throws. ..CLANK.

YOUNG JIMMY (CONT’D)

He runs toward the ball. Through the sliding glass door

OLLIE

Jimmy stops for a moment, hoping it‘s not..

OLLIE (CONT'D)
Your father and I need to talk to you.

...but it is. So much for Virginia being nice.

He drops his head in disappointment... When he raises it,
we're -—

EXT. FLORIDA BASEBALL FIELD - DAY

«++-and the solitude of the backyard is replaced by the sounds
of a Little League baseball gama; clapping, encouragement.

Jimmy, a few months older, shakes off a sign, then nods to
his catcher.

TITLE: HOLLYWOOD, FLORIDA

Jimmy scours the bleachers — Dozens of fans. Dozens of
fathers. But not his own. He collects himself and fingers the
ball.

VOICES FROM THE CROWD
C’mon Jimmy!
Jimmy exhales, disappointed, and tosses a pitch. It makes a
sizzling sound as it sails in and the young batter doesn’t
even swing, overwhelmed.

LITTLE LEAGUE UMPIRE
Strike threei

And the game is over as teammates run in to congratulate
Jimny.

EXT. FLORIDA BASEBALL FIELD - LATER

Jimmy and two of his teammates, BOBBY and MARK, walk in front
of the bleachers. Each of the kids is working on a snowcone.

MARK
I‘ve seen you pitch same good games
Jimmy, but you were on fire today.

A few of the spectators walk by, one taking a moment to
say...

LITTLE LEAGUE FAN
Nice game Jimmy.

YOUNG JIMMY
Thanks.

{CONTINUED }
CONTINUED : 9

Jimmy‘s a step or so ahead of his friends, as if he’s ina
hurry to get somewhere.

BOBBY
You keep strikin’ out that many, Coach’ll
be buyin’ a lot more snowcones...

.».but Jimmy barely hears a word, tossing the rest of his own
snowcone in a GARBAGE CAN and hopping on his BICYCLE.

MARK.
Hey! You aren‘t comin’ to the pizza
place?

YOUNG JIMMY

(already pushing his bike)
Nah, I got somethin’ I want to do.

He pedals off, wasting no time...

YOUNG JIMMY (CONT'D)

EXT. FLORIDA NAVAL BASE - DAY

The sun is still high above the palm trees as Jimmy rides his
bike, zipping between naval officers walking on the sidewalk.

He drops his bike at a tiny office building...and runs in.

Hey Dad...

JIM SR.

Jimmy waits, anxious for his father to ask him about the
game. Jim Sr. opens a file and without looking up...

JIM SR. (CONT'D)
Mmhmm?

YOUNG JIMMY
I had a good game. Thirteen strikeouts.

JIM SR.
(without looking up)
You win?

Jimmy nods. Jim Sr. realizes it’s the wrong file. He puts it
back, plucks another and turns toward his desk, not catching
the disappointed look of a young man who‘d been hoping for
more in the way of praise from his father. After a second,
Jimmy turns to go.

JIM SR. (CONT’D)
I just found out...there's a chance we
may be re-stationed again.

YOUNG JIMMY
(stunned)
How much of a chance?

Jim Sr. doesn’t answer right away, providing Jimmy with all
the answer he needs. They've been down this road before.

JIM SR.
It’s in west Texas. The Navy wants me to
be a recruiter there.

YOUNG JIMMY
Texas? When?

JIM SR.
Three weeks.

YOUNG JIMMY

YOUNG JIMMY

What kind of baseball they have?

JIM SR.
(difficult pause)
They don‘t.

« I hear they might be startin’ some summer
ball.

The devastation on Jimmy’s face is plain. He whispers...

father to see him lose it.

EXT. WEST TEXAS HIGH DESERT ~- DAY 13

Texas. Oil rigs rhythmically pump away on the dry horizon.

INT. CAR - DAY 1

The Morris family car, U-HAUL in tow, cuts a straight arrow
path across the barren landscape. Jim Sr. is at the wheel
Ollie on the passenger side. Jimmy and Kael sit in the back.

KAEL
What are those things?

YOUNG JIMMY
What?

KAEL
Those things goin‘ up and down.

JIM SR.
Oil rigs. When those things are movin’ up

Looks like times are good

Kael watches the flat-land pass by.

KAEL

OLLIE
Yeah, but this time I mean it.

YOUNG JIMMY
You say that every place too.

The station wagon passes businesses and pedestrians. *
16 EXT. TEXAS HOME ~ DAY 16

The back of the U-Haul is open and boxes are spread out on ves
the front lawn. Dry patches of brown grass are scattered {
around on the bone-dry red clay.

Ollie walks from inside the trailer, her hands on her hips

OLLIE
We must‘ve left some of ‘em back in
Florida.

dim Sr. stacks boxes. Kael checks out the drainage ditch .
while Jimmy paws through a box. *

his son‘s face.

But Jimmy doesn‘t jump to. *
JIM SR. (CONT'D) *

Jimmy, for maybe the first time in his life, stares right at *
his father without backing down. Jim Sr. feels it, too, grabs *
a box and carries it over to his son. *
JIM SR. (CONT'D) *

There are more important things in life *

He forces the box into Jimmy’s hands. After another beat, *
Jimmy gives in, turns and carries the box toward the house. *

EXT.” BIG LAKE MAIN STREET - DAY 17

Jimmy takes his bike on its first journey into downtown Big
Lake. The cars are parked in old style diagonal spots.

He spots what he’s looking for...a small CLOTHING AND DRY
GOODS STORE.

INT. STORE ~ DAY 18
Jimmy is giving the socks an ambivalent once~over, but his

attention is drawn to the sound of voices coming from the
back room,

{CONTINUED)
CONTINUED: 18

He wanders to the opening and finds THREE MEN, all 50 or so,
playing dominos. The conversation between HENRY, FRANK and
CAL is an animated one

FRANK
One...billion...dollars. Pay to the order
of Chrysler Corporation. Signed, the lame
headed Congress of the United States.

CAL
One and a half billion.

HENRY
Gentlemen, let's not forget this is a
landmark American business we’re talking
about .

FRANK
If it's such a landmark business, how
come it needs a billion dollars of
taxpayer money?

CAL
One and a half billion.

FRANK
‘Scuze me Cal. One and a half billion.
You wanna answer that one for me Henry?

Henry is dressed a touch more professionally than Frank and
Cal, wearing a SHIRT, VEST AND BOW TIE

HENRY
Because if we don’t give them one...
(looks at Cal)
..and_a half billion dollars, they won’t
be around when we finally get tired of
buying these Japanese cars.

CAL
Cars that are burnin’ our oil.

FRANK

Jimmy looks dejected. Henry sees the look...and warms to it.
He reaches under the counter.

HENRY (CONT’D)
However...might have a catalog that can
help us out.

The dejected look fades and Jimmy walks to the counter. Henry
licks his thumb as he leafs through the pages.

EXT. WEST TEXAS VISTA - DAY 21

Jimmy pushes his bicycle from the road onto the dusty site of
the Santa Rita. He jumps from his bike and lets it tumble.

The old rig still rhythmically pumps. Up. Down.
EXT. WEST TEXAS VISTA - DAY 22

The oil rig is in the background as Jimmy moves to the
parched old baseball field, barely recognizable.

He sees where the mound once was and lightly scoots his foot
across the CHUNK OF WOOD that served as the pitching rubber
decades ago.

Making certain no one is around, Jimmy goes into a wind-up
and throws an imaginary pitch toward home.

He looks to where home plate might have been, but there’s
nothing to see...nothing except the oil rig’s relentless
motion.
..-Up and down...up and down...

DISSOLVE TO:

...and then it's still. Dust has gathered on the Santa Rita
and weeds have sprouted all around the historic rig.

Standing on the pitching mound, where a 12 year old boy was
playing just seconds before...years before...

coming out of the east,

He scoots his foot, almost reverently, along the old mound

and then walks toward his beaten-up PICK UP TRUCK, parked

where the bike had been years ago.

EXT. BIG LAKE MAIN STREET - DAY 24

It’s early morning, springtime, but the faint shimmer from
the town that Jimmy grew up in is now gone.

Severai~of=the-windows“are cracked and dirty, a few of the
small shops are out of business.

Jimmy drives his truck along Main Street. He looks straight
ahead, having seen it thousands of times before.

EXT. BIG LAKE HIGH SCHOOL - DAY 24A

Jimmy pulls into the parking lot of Big Lake High, dirt and
dust covering most of the vehicles. He parks his truck.

INT. BIG LAKE HIGH SCHOOL ~- MOMENTS LATER 25

=XT. BIG LAKE PARK - NIGHT

The weekly Big Lake softball game is in the iate innings, a
fact made painfully obvious by the hot and weary locks worn
by the slightly overweight, very out-of-shape, competitors.
The umpire sits in a lawn chair behind home plate, guarding
the beer cooler.

Jimmy is pitching...and loops a very lazy underhand pitch.
The bases are full. The batter doesn’t swing.

UMPIRE
Ball two.

JIMMY
Sammy...sometimes it helps if you swing
that thing on your shoulder.

SAMMY

HUNTER
C'mon Dad...strike him out!

SAMMY
{starts to work Jimmy}
Hey Big League. You gonna walk me in
front of your own son?

JIMMY
You want your pitch?

SAMMY
Jimmy Morris, gonna walk in a run. Just
like back in summer ball.

Jimmy tosses a pitch...and Sammy crushes it. The ball sails
beyond the outfielders and the runners clear the bases.

For just the shortest of moments, Jimmy watches the ball sail
away...as if watching his own past. The moment’s broken by...

EXT. BIG LAKE HIGHWAY - NIGHT 31

Jimmy’s driving back home, Hunter already fast asleep next to
him. He slows down as he sees the field where he played his
American Legion ball as a young man.

Jimmy pulls the truck to a stop and keeps the headlights on
to illuminate the pitching mound.

He gets out, softly closing the door so as not to disturb his

son, and reaches in the truck bed. In one hand, a glove; in
the other, a BURLAP SACK.

Jimmy gets to the mound, not a soul in sight, and pulls a
baseball from the sack.

His arm stretches out, loosening, and then he casually tosses
a pitch toward home.

Nothing more than a lazy pitch, a routine that for Jimmy is a
way to relax...the same as reading might be for others.

The pattern repeats. Silhouette. The ball clanging into the
chain-link backstop.

INT. BEDROOM ~- NIGHT 32

A baby's cry cuts through the 4:10 AM darkness; not a painful
cry, just the one telling Mom and Dad it’s time to get up.

Lorri tosses the covers aside and groans as she looks at the
clock. Jimmy stirs as if he might be getting up.

JIMMY
I'll get her.

LORRI
Is this a real “I'll get her”...or are
you waitin’ for me to say “go back to
sleep.”

JIMMY
I haven‘t decided.

LORRI
Go back to sleep.

INT. JAMIE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 33

LORRI
How'd everything go last night?
JIMMY
Sammy took me deep and Hunter and I got

whether Nat King Cole was a better singer
than Frank Sinatra.
LORRI
I thought they already had that argument?
JIMMY
(heading out the door)
‘Bout once a week. See ya in an hour. ¢
Lorri smiles and settles into a rocking chair with Jamie, .
quietly singing a lullabye.
INT. CHEMISTRY LAB - DAY 34 *

Jimmy enters his classroom, but it’s too early for any of the
students to be there.

Instead...he finds PRINCIPAL PHIL MCKINNEY, 50, VERY TEXAS,
using a chemistry burner to warm his cup of coffee.

JIMMY
Morning Phil ,

MCKINNEY
Mornin’ Jim. There ain’t nuthin’ over

MCKINNEY

35 EXT. BIG LAKE BASEBALL FIELD - DAY 35

McKinney and Jimmy walk in the outfield of the dried-up high
school baseball field

MCKINNEY
Jimmy, I‘ve always been honest with my
teachers...‘cause it’s the only way I

know.
Jimmy says nothing, listening

MCKINNEY (CONT'D)

We gave baseball a try a few years back,
basically as a way to keep some of the
kids busy between basketball and
football.

(beat)
Football’s religion and the basketball
program's done fine.

{a short pause)
Fact of the matter is...we aren’t seein’
much when it comes to baseball.

JIMMY
We got a good group comin’ back.

MCKINNEY

one game last year. That ain't much of a
team.

Now they both are.

It’s Phil’s turn to listen.

JIMMY (CONT'D)
Baseball's the only thing some of these
kids have. Don’t take it away too.

MCKINNEY

S'your team.

EXT. BIG LAKE BASEBALL FIELD ~ DAY 36

NINE PLAYERS are scattered around the field, most wearing
their year-old BIG LAKE OWL TEE SHIRTS.

Jimmy has a bat over his shoulder and an EQUIPMENT BAG in his
hand as he walks to the plate. A TENTH PLAYER runs up...

TENTH PLAYER
Coach...I forgot my glove.

Without a word and without breaking stride, Jimmy hands him
the bag. The young player starts pawing through it.

JIMMY
{to himself)
Ten players. Nine gloves.

EXT. DUGOUT - CONTINUOUS 47

Hunter shadows his father, as he always does. He props the
bats just so against the fence, making certain the batting
helmets are in a precise line.

EXT. BIG LAKE BASEBALL FIELD ~ CONTINUOUS 38

A ball thumps into the catcher’s glove as Jimmy arrives at
the plate. JOEL, 17 flips the ball to his coach.

JIMMY

JOEL
Couple of holes.

Simmy swats a ground ball to second base.

JIMMY
Let's get one.

RUDY, 17, scoops up the ball and. tosses it to first base
where JOE DAVID, 17, catches it.

JOE DAVID
{tosses it home}
Coach, they puttin’ down any grass this
year?

RUDY
Man...it’s a goat track out here.

Jimmy gets set to hit the ball...

JIMMY
Still waitin’ for the seed to take.

..and he sends a lazy grounder to shortstop. JOAQUIN, 17,
HISPANIC, is down on one knee, giving the infield dirt a once
over. The bail skips right over his head

JOAQUIN
What seed?

Jimmy doesn’t even turn to his catcher, but mutters to him

JIMMY
One of the holes?

JOEL
Yes sir.

The ball trickles into the outfield.

JOAQUIN
Ain't no grass seed here.

He stands up...

JIMMY
Joaquin...

The ball sizzles in from the outfield, but Joaquin’s kicking
the dirt in front of him. Jimmy yells out his nickname. .

JOAQUIN (CONT'D)

Tiger Woods’ backyard?

RUDY
They don‘t even play for six months.

dimmy sends another grounder toward short...a sharp one.

JIMMY
Hey guys? Why don’t you let me worry
about the field...

This time the ball rolls through Wack’s legs, his hands on
his hips.

JOAQUIN
You plan on worryin’ anytime soon?

Jimmy’s patience runs thin.

JIMMY
Wack, what do you say you get some of
your runnin’ in early today.

JOAQUIN
Yeah...I‘11 get my runnin’ in.

He drops his glove in a manner suggesting it’s not the first
time this has happened.

Wack takes off in a lazy jog toward the outfield, kicking up
dirt and sarcastically coughing as he goes. Jimmy has to
suppress a smile. He hits another ground ball...

JIMMY
Alright, let’s bring it home.

EXT. BIG LAKE BASEBALL FIELD ~ LATER 39

The players are gone, all except for Jimmy, Joel and Hunter.
Joel is stacking his gear, while Jimmy gathers some stray
baseballs by the mound. Hunter bags everything else.

Y¥‘know sometimes if you throw...works

Joel tosses a ball a couple of feet in the air. It Pplops into
his glove.

JOEL (CONT'D)
Ball...glove. That kind of thing.

For a second, Jimmy looks as if he'll politely refuse, but..

JIMMY
Might throw a couple.

EXT. BIG LAKE BASEBALL FIELD ~- MOMENTS LATER 40

Joel catches one of the warm-up tosses. It’s nothing special,
producing nothing more than a soft THUD as it hits the glove.

JOEL
How come you throw out there? All by
yourself?

JIMMY

(continues to throw)
Been doin’ it forever. Helps me relax, I
guess.
The lazy game of catch continues.
JOEL
So...back when you were really throwin’.
How fast could you bring it?

JIMMY
I dunno. Eighty-four... eighty-five.

Hunter settles in on the bleachers to watch his father.

JOEL
That's not bad.

JOEL

JIMMY
Can‘t. Promised too many doctors.

JOEL
C'mon man...one's not gonna hurt ya..
{opens and closes mitt)
Feed me.

Jimmy catches the ball and holds it for a second. Joel digs
his cleats in, his glove a tempting invitation.

Hunter leans forward, curious. Joel nods and Jimmy sizzles a
pitch across the plate. It hits Joel‘s glove with a loud
POPPING sound.

Joel is motionless, holding the ball right where it hit. Then
he shakes his mitt - his hand hurts.

JOEL (CONT'D)
Whoa.
(he stands to toss it back)
Where’d that come from?

Jimmy catches the ball. His eyes are in a different time.

JIMMY
Forgot how good that sounded.

Joel settles back in...and there is...

...a flurry of pitches: Pop...pop...THWACK. Each crushing
into the catcher’s glove. One last pop. Joel stands and walks
to the mound.

JOEL
How fast you think those were comin‘?

JIMMY
Not as fast as you think.

EXT. PARK - DAY 41

Lorri sits on a blanket, trying to make sure the stack of
papers she‘s working on doesn’t blow away. Jamie’s asleep
just behind her.

Hunter zips by, fast enough that he takes a few of the papers
with him. Jimmy, not zipping, is a couple of strides behind.

LORRI
Hunter James!

JIMMY
(gathers some of the papers)
Important stuff?

LORRI
Oh, only some college applications I need
to review by tomorrow.

Complete with footprints.

JIMMY
S'what happens when you get in the way of

He sees them down by the swingset: Hunter climbing aboard
while FIVE YEAR OLD JESSICA is already riding high.

Jimmy's father is lightly pushing her. Jimmy‘s smile fades

{a hint of exasperation) -

Yeah well I. don't throw hard enough.

Now come on, hit the shower.

He turns to walk away...again...and again he’s stopped by...

JOEL
We start winnin’,...you try out again.

..,and Jimmy slowly closes his eyes, wondering if the showers
are anytime in the near future. He turns around...

JIMMY
Last time I checked the scouts weren’t .

JOE DAVID *
Not. many science teachers throw like you. .
Jimmy hesitates, sighs... *
JIMMY

Jimmy can‘t ignore the sudden spark in their eyes. He waits
another moment before saying...

JIMMY (CONT'D)
And all I do is find some kind of try-out
somewhere...

JOAQUIN
That’s it man.

The entire team waits for Jimmy's response. So does Hunter.

JIMMY
Alright...if you make it to...

But most of the words after “if” are drowned out...

TEAM
Alright Coach Morris!

The players hop from the bleachers and finally head for the
shower. Hunter smiles as the team runs past his father.

EXT. BIG LAKE HIGH SCHOOL - DUSK 62

Jimmy tosses the equipment bag in the back of his truck and
he opens the door to get inside.

Jimmy slips the truck into reverse and looks at Hunter...

HUNTER
I_know. No tellin’ Mom.

EXT. BIG LAKE GAS STATION - DUSK 63
Jimmy gasses up the truck, Hunter already asleep inside. The
sun makes its last reach across the desert surrounding the

service station.

He gazes at the town as he mulls the very same things he told
his players to think about.

INT. TRUCK - NIGHT 64
The truck rolls along on a lonely stretch of road. Jimmy's
face is blank...until he notices a RADAR UNIT on the side of
the road.

The number flashes...36 MILES PER HOUR...and curiosity pays a
visit. Jimmy pulls to the side of the road.

Hunter stirs, but only for a second. Jimmy keeps the engine
running, unsure of whether he wants to see, whether he even
wants to know, what the radar unit might tell him.

 

He glances in the rear view mirror...and notices something

hanging on it.

THE SAINT RITA. Jimmy reaches for the medallion, rubbing it
between his fingers...

-..he puts the truck in reverse and backs up.

EXT. ROADSIDE ~ NIGHT 66
The lights illuminate the short stretch of highway leading up
to the radar sign. Jimmy, the burlap sack of baseballs at his
feet, stands a few paces in front of his truck...about twenty
or so from the radar sign.

He throws a lazy pitch just to the left of the sign and the
ball rolls away down the road.

The sign reads...42 MILES PER HOUR.

A CAR approaches and Jimmy rummages through the bag, hoping
to look normal. The car passes. 60 MILES PER HOUR.

He grabs another baseball...and this time he throws harder.
70 MILES PER HOUR.
Jimmy throws again...73 MILES PER HOUR.

A look of disappointment with the realization that he’s not
even_fast enough for the minor leagues.

JIMMY
C'mon...

Another pitch...75. Another...76, The exhales become grunts
as he pushes himself harder.

Another...75. Again...76. And he stops as the last ball skips
away into the darkness.

Out of breath, he picks up the empty bag and walks past the
radar unit, hoping to find at least some of the baseballs.

And then...as he walks away...there is a flicker on the green
76 on the screen. Part of the light is burned out.

Hunter races out with the glove and ball, leaving Jim Sr. and
Jimmy to deal with the silence between them. After a beat...

JIM SR.

JIMMY

Jim, Sr. nods, a bit hurt.

Jimmy turns to see a collection of PHOTOGRAPHS on the mantel

THWACK! Wack swings at a sizzling fastball and misses. And
again.

THWACK! Only this time it‘s Joe David standing in, taking a
tentative cut at a sizzling fastball. Very tentative.

THWACK! Rudy swings...and misses.

One after another, no one even coming close to the ball.
Pitch after pitch, player after player. sssssSSSSSSS...

THWACK! THWACK! THWACK!

Knees continue to buckle. Players stand as far to the outside
of the batter’s box as they possibly can. And then --

Wack gets just a tiny part of the baseball, enough to foul it
back behind Joel. It CLANGS against a metal shed. As the
sound echoes --

Everything stops. Every player. Every lazy toss. Every

Someone has finally made contact with a pitch thrown by Coach
Morris. Wack doesn’t know what to say.

Jimmy looks out at the field, part of him knowing he may not

same look he had as a kid back in Florida. He slows down,

HUNTER
What?

JIMMY
It‘s been a good field.

They walk again.

HUNTER
Can we get a slurpee?

JIMMY
Maybe later.

HUNTER
But you said if you wanted somethin’ bad

JIMMY

Yeah, well, I wasn‘t talkin’ about

EXT. BIG LAKE HIGH SCHOOL - DAY 103

The school parking lot is nearly vacant. The marquee on the
SIGN out front reads: HAVE A GREAT SUMMER!

INT. LOCKER ROOM ~- COACH'S OFFICE ~ DAY 104
The room is empty as Jimmy packs his things. He holds a box
under one arm and is pulling some newspaper articles off a
bulletin board with the other.

The headline from the first article reads: OWLS HEADED FOR
STATE TOURNAMENT .

Jimmy smiles as he pulls it down. He reaches for the next.

OWLS LOSE STATE TOURNEY OPENER 6-4. He tucks it in the box
and reaches for the third: a small advertisement...

players: YOUR TURN COACH!

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Jimmy, Hunter and Jessica sit at the small kitchen table
eating cold cereal. Jamie is in the high chair, sloshing
oatmeal everywhere. Lorri zips in, late for work.
LORRI
First day of summer registration and I‘m
gonna have to skip breakfast.
JESSICA
(points to a box of cereal)
You can take some Mister Crunch with you.
JIMMY
He's a Captain Jessie. Don‘t go bustin’
rank on him.
LORRI
Thanks anyway honey.
Lorri gathers her things from the counter and asks Jimmy...
LORRI (CONT'D)
You got anything goin‘ today?
JIMMY
Me? Nah.
LORRI
We need to go see the real estate guy.
HUNTER
He's been a Captain forever. Why don't
they make him something better?
JIMMY
You thinkin’ Admiral Crunch?
LORRI
Just say “yes ma‘am"” so I at least know

EXT. BIG LAKE HIGHWAY - DAY 106

An endless highway stretches out of Big Lake, straight as can
be into the early morning high desert. Jimmy’s truck rolls
past a sign that reads...

SAN ANGELO 97 MILES

...quickly fading into the heat rising from the asphait.
EXT. SAN ANGELO BASEBALL FIELD - DAY 107

Jimmy and the kids are in the old truck; Hunter in the front,
Jessie and Jamie in the tiny extended cab seats in the back.

The truck moves closer to the try-out field and, for a short
moment, it looks as if only a handful of players are there...

...until they get closer and see the field filled with young
players. What little confidence Jimmy had...slips away.

JESSICA
They got lots of players Daddy

Jimmy reluctantly pulls in, as far from the field as he can
get. He sits inside, staring at the players, each with the
drive and conditioning he had years ago.

The truck idles for a few seconds...and Jimmy’s hand slides

on to the stick shift, ready to slip it into reverse. He
glances at Hunter...and the look from his son tells him
everything

The truck stays. The keys turn...the engine falls silent.

EXT. SAN ANGELO BASEBALL FIELD - DAY 108

The young player at the front of the registration line signs
in. The BASEBALL SCOUT behind the fold-out table says...

BASEBALL SCOUT

Jimmy moves to the head of the line; Hunter and Jessie on

EXT. SAN ANGELO BASEBALL FIELD ~ LATER 109

The sun rises high in the sky as Jimmy and the kids sit in
the bleachers watching the other players try-out

The infielders make sparkling plays, the outfielders easy
grabs.

EXT. SAN ANGELO BASEBALL FIELD - LATER 110

Jimmy and the kids now sit on the grass beyond the fence,
catching the shade from the scoreboard.

The try-out goes on. Jessie has a sheet of paper filled with
TIC-TAC-TOE games.

Hunter sits on the open tailgate of the truck. He’s working

It‘s his father...changing Jamie’s diaper.

HUNTER
We’re outta diapers.

JIMMY
(reluctantly cleaning)
We're outta here...soon as Jamie's good

HUNTER

JIMMY

Jimmy stands, wet wipe in hand, and sees Gassoway waving him

in from the pitching mound. He looks at Hunter...

HUNTER
I‘m not doin’ it.
JIMMY
- Just...keep her here. This won‘t take

long.
He tosses the wipe in the truck bed and grabs his glove.
EXT. SAN ANGELO BASEBALL FIELD - DAY
Jimmy jogs the last couple of steps to the mound.

GASSOWAY
You need to warm up?

Jimmy, knowing it won’t take long, stretches his arm behind

his head...not even close to your textbook warm up

JIMMY
Nah, I’m good.

GASSOWAY
{flips him the ball)
Don’t hurt yourself

Gassoway walks away, leaving Jimmy alone on the mound.
He stretches his arm out again and looks in; the catcher
already crouched behind the plate, the scout holding the
radar gun behind the back-stop.

BASEBALL SCOUT
Whenever you‘re ready.

Jimmy takes a deep breath. He hears Jamie let go with an
impatient cry and closes his eyes.

JIMMY
Whenever I'm ready.

And Jimmy lets loose. ssssssSSSSSS...THUMP! The ball smacks
hard into the catcher’s glove, loud enough that a couple of

heads turn from around the field.

Hunter, standing in the truck bed (so he can see), smiles. *

The catcher holds the glove still for a moment, surprised by
the sound. Without a word, he slowly throws the ball back.

Jimmy catches it and scuffs the pitching rubber with his
foot. He exhales, letting his shoulders fall, and throws
again...

THWACK! More heads turn. The scout with the radar gun shows

little reaction, aside from his eyes quickly reading the
unseen number.

Another pitch...POP! Players continue to turn and stare. The
pitches come faster...and faster.

THWACK! THWACK! Gassoway moves alongside the baseball scout,
checking out the radar gun numbers without expression.

Pitch...pop. Pitch...pop. Jimmy looks in...now relaxed.

JIMMY (CONT'D) 7
You want me to keep goin’?

GASSOWAY *
Couple more.

All of the remaining players are now watching. Both Gassoway
and the scout are holding radar guns.

Each pitch piles on top of the other, faster...faster

GASSOWAY (CONT’D) *
That's good, Jim. *

The try-out ends. Jimmy walks from the mound and the young
man who was catching pulls off his mask and jogs out.

YOUNG CATCHER
You were throwin’ hard man.

JIMMY
(scoffs)
C'mon...

YOUNG CATCHER
Yeah, well you got ‘em talkin’

Jimmy looks behind the plate and sees that Gassoway and the
scout are talking...intently.

EXT. SAN ANGELO BASEBALL FIELD - DAY

Jimmy puckles Jamie inside. He holds a diaper in one han

he heads for the garbage.
Gassoway is waiting for him.

GASSOWAY
Jim, how fast were you throwin’ fifteen
years ago?

JIMMY
Slow enough that scouts stopped usin‘ the
word “fast.”

He tosses the diaper in the garbage and as it hits the

bottom...the question is asked again.

GASSOWAY
Jim...

...how fast were you throwin’?

JIMMY

84, 85. Why?

GASSOWAY
You just threw 98 miles an hour.

GASSOWAY
Dozen straight pitches. Two radar guns.
Same thing on both.

JIMMY

Gassoway shakes his head and starts to walk away.

GASSOWAY (CONT'D)
You figure out what I saw out there
today, you let me know...okay?

JIMMY
(still stunned)
Okay.

Jimmy is left alone with about a million thoughts. He glances
over at the now empty field, then turns his eyes to his truck
where Hunter and Jessie are chasing each other round and
round. When Jamie starts crying the picture is complete.

Jimmy's not 20 anymore. What the hell, he smiles anyway.

118 INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT 118

Lorri uses her back to shove open the kitchen door, grocery
sacks taking up both arms. She plops down the sacks on the
counter and punches the TELEPHONE ANSWERING MACHINE.

She starts pulling groceries from the bag...

JIMMY ON THE MACHINE (V.C.)
Hey...don‘t fix dinner, we‘re gettin‘

mot say anything else.

LORRI
Thank you sweet pea...

you.

Lorri looks at Jimmy as she opens the pizza box. Jimmy's
smiling like the cat who ate the canary.

Hunter is silently bursting...

JIMMY
Alright, go ahead...

...and the story floods out. Hunter spills beans everywhere
as Jimmy and Lorri share a look.

INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Pizza-stained plates surround the cable, the kids already in
bed. Jim and Lorri remain...

JIMMY
(still in disbelief)
-and when he said 98...
(shakes his head)
Do you know how many guys throw 98 miles
an hour?
His side of the conversation has an almost dreamy tone to it,
as if he’s still recalling every pitch as he gazes at the
candle in the middle of the cable.

LORRI
Not many?

INT. LIVING ROOM ~- NIGHT 122

The glow of the television set shines on Jimmy's face as he
watches a baseball game.

On the screen...the gate to the bullpen opens and a relief
pitcher jogs toward the pitching mound. Jimmy watches the
short journey...

... givin’ it up without knowin’”...
EXT. SAN ANGELO BASEBALL FIELD - DAY 123

It's pouring rain, a warm Texas storm dumping heavy drops on
the try~out field from two days earlier.

Jimmy wears a TEE-SHIRT and WORKOUT PANTS, already soaked, as
he throws from the mound. His foot slips a bit in the
mud...but the ball sails in hard.

Gassoway and TWO OTHER SCOUTS stand behind the backstop and
all THREE RADAR GUNS read 96 miles per hour.

Hunter sits in the bleachers behind the three scouts, trying
to read the speed.

The pitches keep coming. ..96...97...

GASSOWAY
So much for his arm falling off.

EXT. SAN ANGELO BASEBALL FIELD - MOMENTS LATER 12

The try-out ends. Jimmy walks toward the dug-out and smiles
at Hunter, waiting with his duffel bag and a towel...a look
of pride on his face.

He reaches for the towel, playfully using it to rub his son‘s
head. And as he starts to dry his own face...he notices...

..an OLD TRUCK discreetly parked beyond the outfield fence.
His father’s truck. It slowly backs up and pulls away.

Huncter’s wall - on it are several photos of Jimmy in his

Jimmy throws some lazy warm-up pitches; not in a bullpen, but
on the small part of the field along the right field line.

The young batter at the plate digs in and Jimmy gets ready to
throw his first pitch. He tosses it...

ORLANDO UMPIRE
Ball one.

ORLANDO MANAGER
When I was a boy, my father used to take
me out in the woods to cut firewood for

A slightly bemused look on Jimmy’s face. The manager smiles
back, knowing Jimmy’s indulging him..

ORLANDO MANAGER (CONT ‘D)

Bear with me now. Anyway, the two of us‘d
be out there, and I wanted so bad to cut
more wood than he could. I'd be swingin’

A CAB pulls away, leaving Brooks and Jimmy just outside the
arches that grace the entrance to the park

Brooks walks toward the stadium, while Jimmy lingers for a
moment...looking...taking it all in

INT. LOCKER ROOM ~ DAY 182

Jimmy and Brooks enter the empty Texas locker room, the only
other person...the LOCKER ROOM ATTENDANT who guides them in.

The room is spacious, plush...a contrast to the minor league
locker rooms that have been home the past few months.

The sparkling clean TAMPA BAY UNIFORMS hang in each locker,
the names of each player sewn on the back of each jersey

 

LOCKER ROOM ATTENDANT
Team won't be here for a couple hours
Feel free to look around,

-..and then they see them: two lockers, side by side, with
their jerseys hanging in front. MORRIS. BROOKS.

Two different paths. Two dreams. ..realized.
BROOKS
(touches his jersey)

We ain’t in Kansas anymore...are we Riv?

Jimmy moves closer as well, carefully lifting the jersey off
its hook. The SPORT COAT is behind it, already delivered.

In the pocket...a single YELLOW ROSE. Draped over the hangar
the SAINT RITA MEDALLION.

EXT. BIG LAKE BASEBALL FIELD - DAY 183

Joaquin, Joe David, Joel and Rudy lean against their cars in
silence

There are only five cars waiting to make the trip.

Joaquin stops, stumned at the sight. He opens his door and
gets out...and so does Henry from the lead car.

HENRY
Any you boys know how to get to
Arlington?

JOAQUIN
(a broad smile)
Yes sir.
He quickly gets back in and the five cars pull out onto Main

Jimmy tosses the next pitch with a purpose. The manager keeps
on talking, his expression unchanged.

EXT. BULLPEN - NIGHT 188

Jimmy walks to the far side of the bullpen where THREE RELIEF
PITCHERS lean back in their chairs, spitting sunflower seeds.

RELIEF FITCHER #1
Jim, as chairman of this distinguished
panel of athletes, you should know that
after much discussion and very careful
deliberation...
{nods at the two pitchers)

Jimmy grins and tosses the towel to the side. And as he turns
to head back to the mound...he hears from above

He turns at the sound of her voice. There she is, standing
against the railing that runs above the pen.

Lorri holds Jamie with one arm, Hunter and Jessie stand at
her side. -

The sight of her husband after three months apart, the sight
of him finally wearing a major league uniform.

Overwhelmed, her eyes fill with tears and her voice cracks...

LORRI (CONT’D)
You look great.

Jimmy's eyes well up.

LORRI (CONT’D)
{to Hunter and Jessica)
Doesn't your daddy look great kids?

The kids nod. Jimmy climbs on one of the seats, reaching
up...just close enough to touch Lorri's hand...

JIMMY
Hi.

LORRI
Hi. (

..-the quiet greeting is short, but it’s the look they
exchange that says everything. He touches Jamie’s hand.

JIMMY
Hi honey.

Jessie’s already reaching through...

JESSICA
~ Hi Daddy.

...and Jimmy pauses a moment as he sees Hunter, a young man
so proud of his father. Three hard months meit away.

JIMMY
Hey partner. Missed you.

HUNTER
Me too.
