board in front of the building until it fills the screen. The
poster reads: May 19, 1972 / The Millfield College Workshop /

INT. THEATRE ~ STAGE - LONG SHOT

ve

A large group of students and adults on the open stage which
still contains the set for the play, a large table from it
covered with bottles of soda, cans of beer, varicus chips, etc.
on it; we see students covertly pouring liquor into paper cups.
Music plays loudly on some radio; the song. The focus of
attention is Richard Collier whose pretty date stands smiling
contentedly beside him as he responds happily to beck and
shoulder pats, handshakes, hugs and general ad-lib congratula~
tions. Camera moves in on the group in which he stands. The
following dialogue is largely simultaneous in addition to ac-
lib hubbub of party: .

MALE STUDENT #1
Sensational, Dick! Funny as hell!

RICHARD
Thanks! Glad you liked it!

PROFESSOR
Well crafted, Mr. Collier. You
did yourself proud.

A busty girl comes up to him and hugs him passionately.

alternating between Richard and the woman, each shot taking

us closer to her though, in shaéew, we cannot make out her
features. Dialogue is now a rumble in the b.g. All through
this sequence there is a hinting undercurrent of some strangely
lovely music. The woman cannot take her eyes off Richard and
he is mountingly aware of it, uncomfortable though trying to
maintain a smiling facade toward the people around him. On

the last shot, the woman is gone from her seat. Richard

reacts to her disappearance and looks around. Dialogue flares
as the camera moves around so that it is behind Richard.

DATE
What's the matter, honey?

RICHARD
Uh..-nothing, nothing.

Excuse me, sir?

PROFESSOR
I was saying that I've had’ an idea
for a play kicking around in my
head for some time and thought,
perhaps, we might talk it over.

RICHARD

Oh, yes. That would he.... (X%)

PROFESSOR
It's not a heavy-minded, moralistic
notion, mind you. But it could be....

Suddenly the hand of the very Ola Woman reaches into frame
and touches Richard's shoulder. It is as though he has anti~

He flinches as the Old Woman presses something into his right
hand and leans in close to whisper to him, camera moving in
on Richard's face and her lips or his ear, her whisper shaken,
traumatized.

OLD WOMAN
Come back to me.

She turns abruptly out of frame, Richard staring after her,
camera withdrawing to include Richard's Date and a few of the
others. :

He forces a smile and returns to the group but keeps glancing
toward the o.s. departing Woman, obviously in a state of mys-

He holds up the object -- man's gold watch, obviously not con-
temporary. Richard looks at it, gripped by a sense of some~

eyes, turning.

LAURA (c.s.)
How was the play?

The Old Woman controls her emotions and starts towarcé her room.
Laura Roberts is on the sofa in the sitting reom, wearing a
nightgown and robe, a book on her lap. She is forty-three, a
pleasant-looking woman. The room is furnished with mostly
period pieces.

™he Old ‘loman nods, moves out of frame. Laura starts tO speak,
then doesn't as the o.s. door to the Old Woman's room opens

book and, rising, moves to the door, camera with her.

LAURA

She waits. She is about to speak again when music starts to
play inside the Old Woman's reom, music to which we heard
gathering fragments during the dance sequence in the Theatre
Arts Building. Laura listens curiously.

entrance and stops, looking at the Hall of History. Late
afternoon light through the windows gives the empty corridor

a strange haze-like effulgence. There are photographs on the
walls, display cases, an alcove.- Richard walks to the first
photograph on the wall. It is that of the hotel in the early
1900's, a carriage and horse team in front of it, guests in
the attire of the period. Richard shakes his head, smiling,
then moves to the display case, looks inside. Camera moves to
reveal a dish, a menu, a napkin ring, an iron, a phone, an
open hotel register, a program for a play entitled Wisdom of
the Heart / June 28, 1912. Richard looks at the objects with
a charmed smile, then moves to an alcove. Inside it, behind

a glass partition, is a typical hotel bedroom from early 1900's
~- a bed, a bureau, table, chair, wall mirror, et al. Richard
looks at it, then turns around. Abruptly, he freezes, staring
at something o.s.

And I conceived a notion. What, I
asked myself, if I attempt to hypno-
tize my mind -= suggest to it that
it isn't 1971 but 1571. I mean

actually. Actually is7l.

RICHARD
(eagerly)
Did you do it?

FINNEY
I closed my eyes and fed a sugges
tion into my brain. It's August,
1571. I'm in the Hotel Del Vecchio.
I spelled out details for myself,
kept doing it over and over. August,
1571, the hotel, the details of the
past. Again and again and again.

RICHARD
And -- ?
FINNEY
(hesitates)

Well, I’ll never really know,
Richard. I've never done it since
and I'm not sure I'd want to do it
again. I felt exhausted afterward
-- completely washed out. And, if
it really did happen I was only
there a fraction of an instant,
remember; a flicker.

RICHARD
You were there though.

FINNEY

(shrugs,

smiling)
I thought so.

(beat)
It was imperfect, granted. How
could it be otherwise? There were
objects around me that were clearly
of the present; I knew they were
there. A telephone, a book, my
luggage. And the clothes I wore;
strictly 1971; well, in my case,
probably a lot older.

He and Richard exchange a smile.

RICHARD'S BED

It is covered with empty bags and plastic envelopes of 1900
coins and bills from the coin shop bag. Ricahrd sits on the
bed, pulls open the stapled top of the "stereo" bag anc takes
out two blank cassettes, each marked "320." Reaching out, he
takes the cassette recorder off the table, ejects the cassette
already in it and replaces it with one of the blank cassettes.
He puts the recorder on the table just in front of him, thinks,
then presses down the "start" and "record" buttons simultane-

ously. After a few moments, he begins to speak.

It's June 27, 1912.

starts to put it in his vest pocket, almost dropping it. He

teeth clenching. He keeps drawing in deep breaths of air. He
is obviously very wobbly. Gradually, his head clears and his

gets dizzy again, speeds up and makes it to the bureau with

a few quick steps, leaps on it heavily, eyes closed, breathing

reflection in the bureau mirror, grins at himself. Now he
notices the objects on the bureau -~ men's toilet articles -~

and reacts.

RICHARD 198-5

The woman, still singing, moves around the room, looking for
something. At last she finds a tortoise-shell comb on the
mantel of the fireplace. Picking it up, she returns to the
bedroom. After several moments, Richard moves into frame
and with cautious speed, moves across the sitting room to
the door, camera with him.

He reaches the door and turns the knob to open it. The door
is locked. Further, the only way to open it is with a
skeleton key which isn't there. Richard looks at the door,
appalled. He turns the knob again, in vain, groans softly.
This is too much. He looks around haplessly. Then he whirls
to look at the door. Camera zooms in on the keyhole. Some-
one is inserting a skeleton key into it.

RICHARD 198-E

His expression one of total shock. Suddenly, he lunges for
the sofa and dives behind it; there is no time to make the
alcove. Just as he disappears behind it, the corridor door
is opened by a man with mutton-chop whiskers, wearing a 1912

sees the man standing by the sitting room window, looking
out, his back to camera. “Richard pulls back, waits. After
several moments, with a dismal sigh, Rollo walks into the
other bedroom. He has barely entered it when Richard comes
out from behind the sofa, sees the key in the corridor door
and moves there, still dizzy. The key clicks loudly as he
unlocks the door.

Richard shuts the door as quickly and quietly as he can and
starts toward the elevator, walking as though he is haif-
drunk. He has gone only a few yards when he hears the door
to Suite 313 being opened, and, on impulse, spins and starts
back, walking casually and, by dint of will, evenly. The
man comes out of the room, sees Richard.

ROLLO
Excuse me, did you see someone
try to come in here?

RICHARD
(putting on the
ritz)
Why, yes. Some young chap.
(gesturing)
Ran that way.

ROLLO
I'll be damned. I'd better report
that.

RICHARD
Indeed you'd better,

As the man turns back,

RICHARD
I'd have stopped the rascal if I'd
known that ---

ROLLO
(gruffly)
Yes, yes, thank you.

He goes in and closes the door -~ at which Richard reels to
the wall and leans against it dizzily, groaning.

RICHARD
I traveled sixty-seven years for
this? ”

He leans against the wall a few moments, then looks toward

the elevator with a serious, determined expression. Drawing

in a deep breath, he starts for the elevator.

ANGLE ON ELEVATOR 205
as Richard comes up to it, there are a number of people

waiting. Some glance at him, some don't. In his condition,
being suddenly exposed to 1912 people is somewhat unnerving.

I know how unskilled I am at making

I have no background, sir, and no
experience. I move too clumsily

very name of the play, I'm so
involved in it.

I go berserk on stage.

Pressing forward, she kisses him hungrily. They kiss for a
long time. As they separate, Richard speaks breathiessly.

RICHARD

Her reactive laughter so delights him thet he hugs her tightly.

Tell me more about yourself, love.
What Sort of plays do you write?
Are there parts in them for me?
I'd love to act in one of them.
Assuming that I ever want to act

What did you want to...talk about?

Her voice has faded; she is silent again. They stare at one
another, an aura of emotion building steadily and irresistably
around them. Moments pass. Then, reaching up slowly, Richard

puts his hands on her upper arms. She draws in sudden breath.

ELISE
No.

She doesn't move though. Now he reaches up his hands =~ stili
slowly, very slowly, and presses one palm to each side of her
face, tilting it gently back. Her eyes peer deeply into his,
as though she is searching for some kind of answer she can
understand; as though she knows that, whether or not she finds
that answer, involvement is about to claim her.

ROBINSON (Cont'd)
(pause; shaken)
And you would have her lose all
that to be Mrs. Collier?

RICHARD
(pause; quietly)
I owe you an apology.

ROBINSON
{taken back)
What?

RICHARD
I understand your motivation now
and I respect it. You have nothing
but the best in mind for her.

ROBINSON
(hopefully)
Then you'll -~ ?

RICHARD
But so do I. Do you think I'm
blind? Don't you think I'm well
aware of her potential? Asking
her to marry me won't be asking
her to commit creative suicide.
Of course she'll continue to act -~-
and grow -- and become everything
you see for her.

ROBINSON
(flatly)
With you at her side?

RICHARD
With me at her side.

ROBINSON

(pause; the

gauntlet cast)
No.

{voice trembling)
I have invested all my heart and
soul in her and you will not destroy
that. She -- is ~~ mine.

You're out of your mind.

T'll rid her of you, mark my word.
You shall not have her..

Not even the will of heaven will

Thank you.

He turns to leave, camera pulling ahead of him as he walks
away from the gazebo. Suddenly, the Burly Stagehand and his
companion burst from the o.s. shadows and hurl him to the
ground. As he struggles with them, camera moves to Robinson

The performers seen from behind, taking a curtain call to loud
applause and cheering. As the curtain closes, Elise turns to
camera, her expression one of barely contained panic. She
calls to the o.s. curtain man.

ELISE
No more!

The other performers are startled by this, looking at each
other and at her as she hurries out of scene.

BONES .
No more?

Non.

It doesn't make sense. Where could

Help me quickly. I've got to look

Marie starts to undress her when there is a knock on the door.
With an anxious sound, Elise moves quickly there.

She turns away from him and starts to remove her costume.
Robinson watches her with suddenly haunted eyes. As she turns
to glare at him, he opens the door and goes outside.

Au revoir, McKenna.

He closes the door slowly, tooking at Elise as though he will

the showman to the last.

INT. ROOM - NIGHT 354

as Elise moves inside and looks around, checks the closet.

She is struck uncomfortably by the fact that there are no
clothes, no luggage, only toilet articles on the bureau: A
shaving brush, mug, after-shave lotion, soap, @ comb, tooth-
brush and powder. She checks the closet; empty. The bureau
drawers; empty. She hesitates, then moves out past the porter,
her expression one of deep concern. The porter watches her ¢o,

A strange sight looming overhead, chewing hay.

CLOSE ON RICHARD 356

Recovering from the unexpected sight of the horse, he tries
to sit up but to no avail; he is trussed so rigidly that a
deep breath hurts his chest. He looks around, then, bracing
himself, starts to wriggle toward the stall door. He has
