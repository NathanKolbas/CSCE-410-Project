FADE UP -

AERIAL SHOT

Several thousand feet above Los Angeies.

The afternoon sun streaks through layers of smog and haze.
ETHEREAL MUSIC

A word is handwritten across the screen: strange.
It.dissolves away.

Another word: afraid.

Another: magic.

AN EXTREME CLOSE uP -

A beautiful young face, SARAH, seventeen years old.

The delicate curves of her features, her Botticelli hair, her
creamy skin, don’t hide a pervasive sadness.

: SARAH’S VOICE
Something strange is' going to happen
here. I can’t tell if I’m afraid or not.
Nervous. I wish I could snap my fingers
like magic and it would be a.month from
now. A year...

INT. AIRPLANE - AFTERNOON

Sarah sits next to the window, writing in'a' diary. Her
father, ROGER BAILY, and her stepmother, JENNY, are beside
her, getting ready for landing. -

Sarah looks out the window.

AERIAL SHOT -

The plane enters frame below us, banks left and moves down
into the murk.

EXT. AIRPORT - AFTERNOON

Confusion-- dozens of PASSENGERS, SKYCABS, all manner of
PEOPLE swarm around Sarah, her father, Jenny, as the three
try to find a taxi.

INT. CAB - AFTERNOON.

 

Ignoring her parents’ chatter, Sirah lies back,

the window, listless, mesmerized py the city as it glides by.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

VARIOUS ANGLES - OUT THE WINDOW
ON A STREET CORNER - A WOMAN screams to kigh hell at her
KIDS, little ones, who hold her hands, numbed by her raging.

IN A CENTER DIVIDER - An old Datsun has been neatly
compressed into ore third its original size by a huge
delivery truck. POLICE and PARAMEDICS are all around. Two
BODIES iie. underneath blood-soaked white cloth covers.
ONLOOKERS gape. SOMEONE is crying hysterically.

IN THE NEXT LANE - A jacked-down,; customized, white-on-white
BMW, cruises by. One of the darkly tinted windows is rolled
down. A slumped-down GANG-BANGER with a shaved head and
wraparound glasses leers at us.

ON A SIDEWALK - A towering, psychotic; HOMELESS MAN with
rotting dreadlocks holds a sign aloft: “December 31, 1999
will be the end. PREPARE!!”

=XT. GLENDALE - AFTERNOON
Old Los Angeles: the CAB takes.a turn up a hilly street.
EXT. - THE HOUSE

A hodgepodge of styles: rustic lodge turned Seventies party.
palace. Now it’s painted an odd brown, overgrown with
bouganvillea. Eucalyptus trees creak in the breeze.

But mostly, it’s isolated; there doesn’t seem to be a single
house anywhere nearby.

Roger pays the cab.

ROGER :
It reminds me of my parents’ place in the
Adirondacks. It was a great deal. Some
actress in the Twenties built it as a
hunting lodge. I love being away from the
city noise.
A helicopter BUZZES overhead. They look up.
INT. LIVING ROOM -
The room is huge, with wood beam ceilings, a stuccoed-over
stone fireplace. All of the Bailey’s possessions are stacked
in the middle of the floor, draped with furniture pads.
ROGER
I told them not to put everything in one
place.

Jenny touches a Mexican light fixture.
JENNY
It’s certainly got personality... ~

 

INT. KITCHEN -

Sarah walks-into the kitchen, painted laquer- red, with
Japanese lanterns and shoji screens.

SARAH
Multiple personality disorder.

INT. SARAH'S BEDROOM - DAY

The room is a hitherto unachieved shade of cadmium yellow.
Sarah comes in, sees at it and sighs.

She opens a double-door closet, but it only leads OUTSIDE
with a several story drop and no railing or balcony.

- Roger and Jenny come in, see the Doorway tc Nowhere.
ROGER

Hmm. That’s not exactly to code... It’s
going to take some fixing up. But my
nésting instinct is-raging. What do you
think?

A SARAH
It's fine. Whatever...

(walking out)

I’m gonna go look for my clothes.

JENNY
Stop worrying. She'll be okay.

Her remark annoys him.

INT. LIVING ROOM -

Sarah is. rummaging around in the huge pile of stuff. Behind
her, the setting sun streams through the front door.

A figure is moving up the front steps, completely
silhouetted.

BEHIND SARAH -

A shadow of a MAN moves up the far wall, stands in the
doorway. The shadow holds up a snake.

IN ONE INSTANT:

 

MAN
Welcome to the end of the road.

Ww

 
 

 

Sarah turns, and sees a dixty VAGRANT with hollow eyes,
smiling, snake in hand.

Sarah shifts into another mode.

VAGRANT’S POV OF SARAH - SOMETHING WEIRD IS HAPPENING: BRIGHT
LIGHT starts to emanate from behind Sarah. And her face
starts to CHANGE...

Startled, the Vagrant drops the SNAKE, steps back.

The SNAKE wriggles towards Sarah. She scrambles away,
knocking a chair over.

ROGER
(running down the
stairs)
Sarah...?

Roger sees the Man,. picks up a fireplace poker and charges at
him. :

“ROGER
Get the fuck out of here!!!!!

‘The Man jogs back, confused. Roger slams the door, breathes.

ROGER
Sarah, are you alright?

SARAH
(off somewhere)
I... Yeah...

THROUGH A WINDOW - The Vagrant is running away, up the
illside.

VAGRANT
Scary chick! Scary chick!

ANGLE - The snake is slithering across Roger’s foot.

He raises the poker and slams it down with a fleshy PLONK.

INT. SARAH'S ROOM ~ NIGHT

Sarah sits on a mattress which has been made up for bed. She
eats Chinese food from a container. Roger stands in her
doorway. :
ROGER

The reaitor said he’s just a weird guy

that lives in Griffith park...But he’s

never hurt anybody... You're not going to

be spending any time here by yourself.

Jenny or I will always be around.

  
 

 

ou

SARAH
I didn’t say anything.

ROGER .
I gust want peace and quiet for you...
like the doctor said... Maybe we should
move...

SARAH
No, it’s fine!

: ROGER
(backing off)
Okay, alright.
Roger goes.

ANGLE ~ An old black and white PHOTO of Sarah’s MOTHER in a
garden.

Sarah. takes the photo from a packing carton, touches the
glass.

INT.. SARAH'S ROOM - LATE NIGHT .

. Sarah lies there,. eyes open.

OUT THE DOOR TO NOWHERE - It’s very dark.
A breeze rustles the trees. We hear the clock TICKING.

AN ALARM goes off. A hand reaches for it.

INT. BEDROOM - MORNING

This is a different bedroom, fully furnished, very subdued.
A teenage girl is getting out of bed, BONNZE STEWART, somber,
pale, covered in a longsleeved nightgown. She puts her hair
up in a ponytail while she gets her bearings.

INT. CLOSET -

Bonnie pulls out a grey Catholic school uniform. She stops
and looks in her full-length closet mirror. She siips her
nightgown off.

We are looking OVER HER SHOULDER, but we see just enough ci
some very extensive, reddish scarring across her shoulders,
chest and arms.

Something awful, happened to her.

 
 

 

 

ON

Bonnie looks in her own eyes, doesn’t like what she sees.

A MOTHER’S VOICE
(£rom somewhere)
Bonnie, are you up?

BONNIE
Yeah.

INT. KITCHEN IN HANCOCK PARK - MORNING

An attractive, well-coiffed black MOTHER, is just finishing a
pan of scrambled eggs in her very upscale kitchen. She moves
to the tastefully decorated

BREAKFAST NOOK

which contains an extremely handsome black family: FATHER,
BROTHERS, SISTERS and ROCHELLE MACK, 16, model-pretty and
thin. She almost makes her familiar grey Catholic school
uniform look glamorous.

Rochelle scoops up some scrambled eggs, her second helping,
and wolfs them down. : .

Rochelle’s Mother watches this.carefully.

ROCHELLE’S FATHER
(to a brother)
You can get the verbal up. Stanford puts
a lot of weight on those scores.

ROCHELLE’S BROTHER
Yes, sir.” j

ROCHELLE'S FATHER
(to Rochelle)
How’s your half gainer coming in
practice, honey?

. ROCHELLE
Good, I guess.

ROCHELLE’S FATHER
That sounds good...
(mockingly to the
rest of the table)
...I guess.

ROCHELLE
(leaving the table)
Excuse me.

ROCHELLE’S MOTHER
Where are you going?

 
 

 

 

 

ROCHELLE
To get my books. Is that alright?

An ongoing tension between them.

INT. ROCHELLE’S BATHROOM -

Rocheile is crouched over the toilet, an empty package of |
plain doughnuts lying nearby. She wipes her mouth, flushes
the toilet. A KNOCK on the door.

ROCHELLE’S MOTHER
(from outside)
Rochelle, you're going to miss your ride.

Rochelle very carefully and silently folds up the doughnut : .
wrapper and puts it in her bookbag.

She picks up stray crumbs as she goes to the door.
ROCHELLE’S MOTHER
_ (from outside) :
Rochelle?
INT. HALLWAY OF A TRAILER HOME - MORNING

NANCY DOWNS comes ‘out of the bathroom. She wears the same
uniform as the others, but with a white-trash vibe: bleach-

‘blonde hair, too much makeup, an ankle tatoo.

Nancy is face to face with RAY, paunchy, unshaven, in Roto-
Rooter cover-alls. As the two maneuver past each other in the
tiny hallway, Ray Looks down her shirt.

RAY
Did I ever tell you I have a thing for
girls in Catholic school uniforms?

Nancy scratches. her cheek while giving him the finger.

NANCY
(acid) :
Yeah, Ray. But I love hearing it again
every morning.

He laughs a smoker’s laugh which turns into a smoker’s cough.
Then he lights up.

INT. TINY MASTER BEDROOM - CONT.

Nancy’s mother, GRACE, is out. cold on the bed amidst a wine
bottle, an overturned ashtray, a TV Guide.
 

 

 

 

NANCY
Mom...

No response. Nancy goes to the purse on the bedside table,
opens the wallet: a few singles, coins. Nancy takes it all.

EXT. TRAILER - MORNING

Nancy steps outside the-dilapidated TRAILER set in the
backyard of an even more dilapidated old BUNGALOW.

EXT. SILVERLAKE BUS STOP - MORNING

Nancy scans for'a seat amid sea of HISPANIC WOMEN, all
chattering on in Spanish.

Nancy sits in back. Across the aisle are two ninth grade 30YS
in school uniforms. They whisper to each other when they see
Nancy. :

One of them starts miming a blow job.
Nancy turns.
: NANCY
If you.don’t stop, I’ll fucking rip your
testicles off. : ‘
The Boys are afraid.
EXT. ST.’ BERNARDS ACADEMY - MORNING
BUSES and CARS deposit swarms of uniformed STUDENTS: The
school has a fading elegance: graceful stuccoed buildings,
cracked, patched and tinged with graffitti.
INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY
CHRIS HOOKER, TREY HANTHAM, MITT ROGERS, and a handful of
other JOCKS hang by the water fountain, perched on either
side of the hall.
A spindly-looking lower-class BOY, has to walk through them.

Trey and Mitt merely glare at the boy. This is enough to make
him sprint off.

MITT
Oh look. It’s the Reining Miss Trailer
Trash USA, the anorexic freakazoid, and
Freddy Krueger’s monster bride.

Bonnie, Rochelle and Nancy are approaching. The Boys fall
silent as they pass.

 

 
 

 

 

Trey coughs artfully spicting out the word ‘scum fuck’ or
‘fuck me’ or ‘blow job’. Other boys follow suit, except
Chris, who seems annoyed.

CHRIS
Watc. ‘he fucking language, you guys.

Nancy glares at Chris: SOMETHING BETWEEN THEM.

BONNIE
So many men, so little ammunition.

‘DOWN THE HALLWAY -

Once they reach their lockers, Bonnie pulls out a strange
paperback. .

BONNIE

The Almanac says today will bring an
arrival of something...?

(finding it, reading) :
“...a new wholeness, and with it, a new
balance between North, South, East and
West. Earth, Air, Water, and Fire...
Maybe it’s a fourth.

‘ NANCY
Aren’t we good enough?

"BONNIE
Four would make a ring.

NANCY
. Look. There’s our fourth.
‘ i
ANGLE - A huge, rather. macho-looking, uniformed female
SECURITY GUARD.

The girls LAUGH.

- INT. FRENCH CLASS - DAY . . : +

Bonnie sits in. French class, trying her best to avoid the
gaze of MONSIEUR THEPOT, the rakish, fortyish French teacher.
He speaks only IN FRENCH and is SUBTITLED.

THEPOT
Welcome back, class. I hope you had a
fine weekend. Monsieur Rogers, how was
your weekend?

MITT
Tray bee-in, Mon-sewer.
THEPOT . io
How did you spend your weekend? At the
beach? At a rock concert? Looking for
girls?

 

Mitt looks lost.

THEPOT
Cherchez les femmes? Hmmmm? Les femmes?

Thepot makes an hourglass shape in the air.

MITT
You mean did I get any pussy?

The class LAUGHS. Thepot is not amused.

THEPOT
En francais, Monsieur Rogers.

MITT
Qui. Bow-coup de pussy, Mon-sewer Thepot.

SARAH
(from somewhere, in
perfect French) -. .
Like hell you did, you pig:

CO

Heads turn. Thepot smiles.

THEPOT
Ah, Madamoiselle Baily, our new student.
Your French is excellent. Did you live in
France or Canada?

SARAH .
No, but I went to a school where they did
not allow Cro-Magnon men into the
classroom.

Thepot is impressed.
ANGLE.- BONNIE - She stares at Sarah.

MITT
Jesus... You know in LA we should be
learning Mexican anyway.

SARAH
{in English)
Then why are you taking French?

MITT
Because I want to be near you,
. (muttering) .
...fuckin' bitch.

 
 

 

The boys laugh, except for Chris.
THEPOT
Monsiér Rogers! That's enough! Alright,
Madamoiselle Martin...

Thepot keeps talking in French but it FADES AWAY as we

MOVE IN on Sarah. She’s watching something.

UP AHEAD - Bonnie takes a pencil and stands it on its lead .,
point, balancing it with her index finger. ‘

She stares at the pencil and, concentrates.
She takes her finger away, and the pencil stays standing.
Sarah watches, mesmerized.

Bonnie turns to Sarah.

The pencil falls.

Bonnie’s expressionless stare ‘shoots through Sarah.

INT. BIOLOGY LAB. - DAY

Class hasn’t started yet. Nancy and Rochelle are at a rear
lab table.

ROCHELLE
.' That fucking Laura Lizzie.

ANGLE - LAURA LIZZIE, a muscular, blonde swimmer, joking with
her LAB GROUP.

NANCY
What about her?

ROCHELLE
_ Last Friday I couldn't find my Clothes.
They were floating in the pool. My. mother
had to drive me home in my bathing suit.

NANCY
Why didn’t you say anything?

ROCHELLE
I'd quit the team, but my dad would have
a brain hemorhage.

Bonnie rushes in, excited.
 

BONNIE

ROCHELLE
Who?
BONNIE
Someone to be the fourth. I know she’s
the one.
NANCY
Shut up.
BONNIE

I’m serious. She's in here next. Look.

Sarah wanders in, confused. She talks to a TEACHER up front
who directs her to take a seat. Sarah comes to the Girls.

SARAH
Can I sit here?

Nancy crosses her eyes.

NANCY
. (funny .voice) :
Frankly honey, we'd prefer it if you
didn't.

 

Sarah walks off.

BONNIE
(calling after Sarah)
No, you can have it...

Too late. She's at another table.
BONNIE
{to Nancy)
Happy now?

NANCY
— She's a freak.

BONNIE
Then she'll. fit right in.

NANCY
(eyes crossed)
Uh oh. I think my eyes are stuck.

men. I’m Chris.

(he sits)

SARAH
So many people have been rude, it’s hard
to keep track.

CHRIS
Who élse?

SARAH
Don’t stare. Check out four o'clock.

Chris very artfully yawns and stretches, turning his head to
see the Girls.

CHRIS
Oh shit. It’s Fear, Loathing and
Pestilence. Whatever you do, stay away
from them.

WITH THE GIRLS - Bonnie is watching closely.

BONNIE
They're talking about us. I can tell.

Chris sneaks a nervous look at Bonnie.

BONNIE
:..He'’s telling her about me, the scars.

Nancy's: hand goes on Bonnie’s shoulder.

BACK WITH CHRIS AND SARAH -

CHRIS
...shle’s got these burn scars all over
her body. I haven’: seen them, but I know

some even scarier shit about them...

SARAH
What?

 
   

CHRIS - |
They're witches.

 

. SARAH
Really?

CHRIS
No. I don’t think so. They just have that
bitchy-witchy-Stevie Nicks-thing
happening.

He touches her hair.

'

SARAH
What are you doing?

He buries his face in it and sniffs. She tries to pull away.

CHRIS
I have a hair fetish. You use... Pantene.

SARAH
That's impressive.

CHRIS
What are you doing after school?

ae | - apa

Nothing, I guess.

 

CHRIS
Really? I’m busy.

Annoyed, she finally swats him out of her hair.

CHRIS

SARAH

Chris smiles his shit-eating grin and gets up.

CHRIS
You could come and watch. A lot of the
girls do.

SARAH

No thanks. I just remembered I’ve got an
appointment for some root canal and.I’m

EXT. FOOTSALL FIELD - -DAY

‘Several cars are parked next to the field with several
GIRLFRIENDS sitting inside, eating, trying to do homework,
but mostly watching their BOYS doing scrimmages.

ANGLE - BEHIND SOME TREES - We spy Sarah, doing her best not
to be seen. She scans for Chris on the field.

A VOICE
Looking for something?

Sarah turns. Nancy, Bonnie and Rochelle are right there.

SARAH
No...

BONNIE
Some. of these football dicks make their
girlfriends come watch them practice. As

Nancy leads them out of the pet store.
INT. CLOTHING BOUTIQUE > DAY
Browsing.

BONNIE
What’ does your father do?

SARAH
Retail consultant for Holland Ross. .You
ever take one of those?

BONNIE
It’s a little conservative for me.

Bonnie twists a new red scarf around her neck. Sarah looks
around, nervous. A bitchy SALESMAN is eyeing them.

“= - BONNIE
— You know, everything in nature steals.
Big animals take from little ones.

NANCY
This place blows. Let's make like Tom and
cruise.

ROCHELLE

Let’s make like Hemingway and book.

BONNIE
Let's make like Smuckers and jam.

They look at Sarah:
7 SARAH . :
Let's make like a baby and head out.
The girls LAUGH, moving to the-door. '

SALESMAN
Young lady, that scarf...

(- They all make a b-line for the exit... except Sarah who
. =) stands right in front of the Salesman.

She touches his hand.
 

 

SARAH
Excuse me...

THE SALESMAN’S POV - Sarah looxing straight at him.
Sarah’s eyes are riveting.
g behind her is brightening, FADING TO a shimmering

il ic melts down. Sarah's shape is darkening INTO:
SHADOW, dissipatin

  

SARAH
(weird, echoey)
Excuse me...
BEHIND SARAH’S BACK - Nancy waves the girls away. They run.
BACK IN THE VISION -
Sarah's shape thins and twists into a wire hanger. It falls.

With a CLANG,. everything snaps back -to NORMAL.

The Salesman bends over, dumbstruck, to pick up a wire
hanger.

Sarah stands over him, holding up a shirt.

SARAH
(impatient)
Excuse me, do you have this in a medium?

SALESMAN
I, uh...?

The Salesman rubs his temples and sits down on the floor.

SALESMEN
Oh my.. I’ve just got to cut back on the
Nutrasweet. I know that’s what it is. I
just read an article... I’m sorry. You
were asking...?

To SARAH
Nevermind.

EXT. MALL - AFTERNOON

The three Girls wait just outside the main entrance, .as Saran
comes out.

NANCY
What did you say to that guy?
 

I

 

 

SARAH

Nothing.

BONNIE

Bonnie and Rochelle give a look.to Nancy.

ROCHELLE
You'll like these.

EXT. SILVERLAKE - AFTERNOON

Rochelle’s beret, Nancy’s high tops, and Bonnie’s scarf.
Together with Sarah they march through a graffitti-splacttered
part of town.

ROCHELLE
Why did you move down to L.A.?

Long silence.

SARAH
I killed myself.
(laughing coldly)

I mean, I tried to... People found out. |
My. dad couldn't handle it. He gota
transfer.

' ROCHELLE - -- i
Oh.

Sarah walks ahead.

The girls all look at“each other.

INT. CANDLE SHOP - AFTERNOON

Dark, Catholic, and decrepit. The proprietor, an ethereal
Latina with a lined face, named LIRIO, eyes the Giris warily.
Sarah browses the occult paraphenalia.

Rochelle comes over and hands Sarah a book.

SARAH
I have a diary.

 
 

 

 

 

ROCHELLE
This is better. You put spells and power
thoughts in it. Then don’t let anyone
read it, ever. Except maybe us.

. SARAH
You guys are ail into this?

. ROCHELLE
Sort of.

Rochelle slips some incense into her pocket and wanders off.
Nancy approaches a PAINTING surrounded by candles and
mirrors. The PAINTING is of a woman, a witch probably,
enveloped in electric iight, deep in the throes of ecstatic
pain or pleasure.

A small plaque below reads: ‘Invocation of the Spirit.’

Bonnie walks up.

NANCY
I want to. see a god.

BONNIE
That's nice, Nancy.

The girls stare at the painting.
WITH SARAH - She continues to browse. Books, medallions.

She picks up a boxed set of candles, red, black, white. She
smelis them.

‘Just then, a MIDDLE-AGED COUPLE enters the shop. They nod to
Lirio, then disappear behind a black curtain in the back of
the store. Sarah is curious.

She approaches the curtain.
Suddenly a wrinkled hand stops her.
~ "+ LIRTO

That’s not for you.

SARAH
Sorry...

Lirio sees an old ring on Sarah’s hand.

LIR=O
A beautiful ring. It was your mother’s.

 
SARAH ai |
(taken aback)

 

Yes.
Lirio looks at the box of candles, the book.
LIRIO
You going to pay for those?
: (off Sarah’s nod)
Not like your friends.

They go to the counter. Sarah pays.

LIRIO
You know how to use candles?
SARAH ,
You light the wick.
LIRIO
More than that. Red is for love. Black
is... Here. Take this. Read it.

Lirio gives her a small book covered in Old English script
and engravings.

CA SARAH
Ne I‘*ve never read any books about... you
know... I just... kind of... feel it...

LIRIO

Did someone teach you? Your mother?

SARAH
No, she’s dead.

LIRIO
You are a Natural Witch. Self-taught.
Your power comes from within.

Lirio touches Sarah’s hand, the ring, nodding, giving Sarah a
creepy smile.

BONNIE
(calling)
Sarah, come on...
Sarak goes to the girls.

“EXT. CANDLE SHOP - CONT.

 

As they trudge off. .

NANCY
I can’t believe you paid. It’s so
embarrassing.
 

 

EXT. BAILEY HOUSE - EVENING

Sarah trudges up the driveway. It’s dark, and the hills are
quiet. .

INT. FRONT HALLWAY - EVENING

Sarah's father and Jenny are sitting in the dining room
looking very agitated. When Sarah comes in, he jumps up.

: ROGER :
Where the hell have you been?

1

SARAH
Just. hanging out with some friends from
school.

ROGER
It’s seven o’clock in the evening. We
were this far away from calling the
police!,

: SARAH
Relax. I’m not dead.

 

This stops him cold. Sarah’ runs upstairs.

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

Sarah has passed out on her bed, still in her clothes. She
has lit a dozen or so of the CANDLES from the store.

The breeze from the open Doorway to Nowhere lightly tosses
the flames to and fro.

Sarah BREATHES heavily while she sleeps.
The sound of her BREATH is growing deeper, cavernous, like
some huge beast... and it synchs with the BREEZE from the

window.

The CANDLES are blowing out and relighting with each BREEZE,
with each breath.

Suddenly the PHONE RINGS.-Sarah dives for it.
The BREEZE stops.

SARAH

 

Helio?

VOICE
What are you wearing?
 

 

 

SARAH
Who is this...? Oh.

CHRIS’ VOICE
I. need a mental picture otherwise I won't
be able to get my rocks off. This is 976-
HOTT, right?

SARAH
You're sick. How.did you get my number?

CHRIS’ VOICE |
Inflamation... I looked for you on the
field.

SARAH
I told you. Root canal.

CHRIS’. VOICE
This Friday. After practice. A real date.
zI’ll buy you dinner and you'll give me
sex.

SARAH
You're a pervert.

CHRIS’ VOICE
I‘ll take that as a yes. Later.

CLICK.

SARAH
Hello?

She lies back, slightly annoyed, but rather more excited.

EXT. AMBASSADOR HOTEL ROOFTOP - EVENING

Sarah and.Chris lie beneath the dilapidated neon ‘Ambassador
Hotel’ sign. Chris kisses her, rapaciously, .bending her body
around his, stroking her everywhere. .

His mouth goes down her chest, as he opens buttons on her
uniform blouse.

Sarah is not emotionally engaged. She watches a smog-hued
sunset.

Just then, Trey and Laura Lizzie round a corner, hand in
hand. Sarah smiles at then, embarrassed. ©

LAURA
It was nice to meet you, Sarah.
 

 

 

TREY
We’ll catch you later, bro.

CHRIS
(coming up for air)
Peace.

Laura and Trey descend a ladder.

Chris dives back into Sarah. He starts unbuttoning his pants,

A little blood drips in too.

She drinks the pinkish water.

She wavers, and the glass drops, SMASH!

Water, blood, shards of glass on the floor, all around her

Gradually we PULL BACK to reveal she is on her bed.
There‘s no blood.
She rubs her wrists: they’re normal.

There’s a distant KNOCK at the front door.

pond, the sun glimmering all around her.

It was you, Manon... ‘

She looks up, still shaken by this past event, closes her
book.

She's the only one still fully clothed. Everyone is lcoking
at her.

Slowly, Bonnie unbuttons her blouse,. slips it off. She pulls
off her skirt.

The. SCAR covers more than half her body,’ in jagged strokes
across her chest, arms, shoulders, knees, as if someone had
splashed paint on her and swirled it around. ‘ .

She looks so vulnerable.

Bonnie, I think you're beautiful...

Bonnie relaxes, even gives a pained little smile. She gets in
the water.

Sarah swallows and picks up. her book.

As long as I remember, I could do it.
Wish things, the visions. And I always
felt sick. Like the world didn’t need a

realized I would rather be dead. But [I
didn't die. I made it here, where I
finally belong. It’s been a long road,
but I finally found these three. Now we

SARAH
Don’t. stop.

-BONNIE
It would be so much easier if I could
give up.

SARAH
Bonnie, make it work.

BONNIE
How?

SARAH
Everything you're feeling, the pain, thac
will make it happen...

A tear runs down Bonnie’s cheek. Sarah instinctively catches
it on her finger. .

She takes a glass and rubs the tear on the bottom of the
glass.

BONNIE
What are you doing...?

Sarah opens the carafe and pours in some wine. She lights up |
the sage stick. She douses the sage in the wine, it SIZZLES
turning the liquid dark purple.

Sarah dips her fingers in-the wine, and, pulling back
Bonnie’s sheets, she flicks the liquid ali over the bandages.

Bonnie closes her eyes.
 

 

 

BONNIE
It feels warm.

Sarah WHISPERS something, continuing to flick the liquid.

BONNIE
It‘’s getting hot. Ow...

Outside the window there’s a gust of WIND.

BONNIE

Suddenly the window flings open, and a GUST OF WIND blows
into the room, tossing everything around.

INT. EXAMINING ROOM - DAY

Bonnie, draped in an elaborate surgical shroud, sits with her
Mother and several NURSES. The Doctor pauses.

DOCTOR
I want you.to remember that we may need
to make several passes before we can see
results.

Bonnie nods.

The Doctor cuts the section on Bonnie’s back, behind her
right shoulder, where she can’t see. He peels back the
bandages.

RED FLAKY SKIN. A Nurse takes a picture with a DIGITAL
CAMERA. The skin appears on a COLOR ENHANCED COMPUTER SCREEN
where Bonnie can see it.

BONNIE
What is that? Is it better?

The Doctaer. takes a swab and dips it in solution: He wipes
away the flaky material.

The Doctors face goes blank.

BONNIE
What..,?

DOCTOR
Just a minute.

He cuts some more, swabs some more.
 

 

BONNIE
Waat does it look like?

MRS MACK
I can’t see...

 

The Nurse takes a picture. The image appears on the COMPUTER
SCREEN.

Mrs. Mack looks at it and starts crying.
Bonnié -- something beautiful happens inside her.

We. ‘see Bonnie’s back. Underneath a layer of slimy
disinfectant and flaky bits: glowing HEALTHY SKIN.

The Doctor runs his hands over Bonnie's back.

DOCTOR
I can’t believe it...
(he laughs)
It works...

INT. HOMEROOM - MORNING
Sarah is huddled with Rochelle and Nancy in the back, while a
TEACHER DRONES ON reading an announcement. Thirty.or so
STUDENTS, still not fully awake.

BONNIE
Thanks for the info.

Scattered CHUCKLES.

 

As she crosses in front of the whole room, Bon:
nonchalantly drops the cape. Her knee-length plaid u
skirt has been hiked up to a mini, and she wears ac
tank top instead of the requisite blouse.

 
  

But most importantly, her skin, of wkich we see quite a io
is £lawless, no scars, nothing.

She and Sarah hold hands.
BONNIE

maybe kind of stupid. I guess that goes
with being beautiful, right Rochelle?

ROCHELLE

They laugh.

Then who did?
Suddenly the LIGHTS GO OUT.

GRACE

Grace gets up and teeters down the hall, Scotch in hand,
throwing open the door to the

GRACE
Did you pay the power bill? Ray...?
Nancy’s got homework.

RAY

Grace comes over and kicks him. He just lies there. She kicks
him again, and this time he grabs her foot, pulling her down
onto the bed. The tumbler of Scotch falls.

BONNIE
‘Sarah doesn’t feel like talking to you.

Bonnie hangs up, and they all LAUGH, except Nancy who hangs
over the ledge of the Doorway to Nowhere. Bonnie notices.

BONNIE .
Why don’t you wish for something?

 

NANCY
How can I wish for one thing when

Grace is in the KITCHEN, fixing a drink. Rochelle pours over
the jukebox.

ROCHELLE
Every song on here is by Connie Francis!

Grace totters in, her highball TINKLING.

Ever since I was a little girl I said

Suddenly ‘Who's Sorry Now?’ echoes through the giant space.

 

THROUGH THE DOOR - We spy Grace, in the dining room archway,
deep in the throes of an empassioned lip-synch of the SONG.

Casting visions is the oldest form of
magic for witches. It started with nights
around the fire, shadows on the cave

Sarah closes the book.

Nevermind about that... Just feel. You

NANCY:

“I' bet I could do it to all of you.
Sarah scoffs.

SARAH
Well, you can try it.

They turn to.Nancy in the mirror. She closes her eyes. They
wait. . - ,

Nancy places her hand on Sarah's.

Without any light theatrics, Nancy MORPHS into a MALE VERSION
of herself.

MALE NANCY
Women... if it weren’t for the pussy, I’d
say kill ‘em all.

Rochelle and Bonnie burst into hysterics, knocking the mirror
over - CRACK.

Rochelle's eyes are closed. She starts to move upwards, but
it’s hard to tell how far.

FROM ABOVE - Rochelle is drifting towards us. An inch or so,
but then more: six inches, a foot, three feet. Finally they

NANCY
Just because we’re young and beautiful,

Rochelle’s case.

ROCHELLE
What?

SARAH
Is it black magic behind the curtain?

LIRIO
True magic is neither black nor white. It
is both because nature is both. Loving

rattlesnake, rose. It keeps a balance on
it’s own. So you must not throw that
balance out. Understand?

What are you, ‘Nancy: Part Two?’

BONNIE
I’ve spent most of my life being a
monster. Now that I’m not, I’m having a
good time. If you can’t deal with it,
fuck off.

ROCHELLE
Look.
 

 

 

 

ANGLE ~ the light inside the store GOES OUT.

INT. CANDLE SHOP - NIGHT
Muffled VOICES as the Girls appear outside the door.

A litter of pickled FETAL PIGS bob in a dusty jar of
formaldehyde. ~

Nancy crawls out from behind the boxes, brushing against the
jar. It. falls - SMASH! The pigs scatter.

Nancy freezes.

INT. LIRIO’S APARTMENT (UPSTAIRS) - NIGHT - CONT.

Ancient and musty, filled with memorabilia, various religious
icons.

Lirio rises from a daybed and turns the television down,
listening.

INT. CANDLE SHOP - NIGHT - CONT.

Nancy covers her nose, slinks over to the door, and, holding
the skeleton bell still, opens the door.

SARAH
(whispering)
What’s that smell?
NANCY
(whispering)
I broke a jar.
The Girls all see the pigs. Rochelle stifles a gasp.
NANCY
(whispering)
_ Relax.
She waves them on. They tiptoe through the pigs.
ANGLE - MOVING TOWARD THE BLACK CURTAIN.
Sarah doesn’t look pleased.
Bonnie takes her hand.

We follow the girls as they move toward the curtain an
through the doorway.

 
 

. : 73
MAINTAINING ONE CONTINUOUS SHOT, we find it very bright on
the other side. In fact, we are outside and IT IS DAYTIME.

   

EXT. SCHOOL LAWN - DAY

 

11 in ONE SHOT, we move around the girls and see behind
them, where we came from, nothing but a broad expanse of open
space, lawn, trees, .a few STUDENTS.

Sarah, Rochelle, Nancy and Bonnie come to a stop, dazed,
utterly perplexed.

ROCHELLE

 

What...?
Sarah looks at her watch.

SARAH
It’s Thursday... fifth period.

NANCY ,
Did the same thing happen to everybody
else as what happened to me?

. BONNIE
What the fuck...?

ROCHELLE .
This is just like that time I blanked out
after drinking eight Kamikazes at Fung
Lums except this time I’m not waking up
in a.pool of egg-roil vomit.

 

NANCY
Will you jerks shut up? We have just done
something amazing. I mean, I have.

Sarah runs off.

NANCY
What’s wrong with you?

SARAH
I don’t know.

BONNIE

(quietly)
She’s starting to get on my nerves.

A CRACK OF LIGHTNING! And a slow roll of THUNDER

 

EXT. MULHULLAND - MURKY DAY

 

The Mustang slips around a curve, going just a li
fast.

 
 

INT. NANCY'S CAR - CONT.

It's claustraphobic with the hood down. The four Girls take
up every available square inch.

Nancy and Sarah are embroiled in a heated discussion. |
.
|

SARAH
You're missing the point. I know we can,
but the point is whether or not we

should.

NANCY
If we can, we should.

SARAH
But if you don’t need something, why ask
for it?

NANCY
Because I want it.

Nancy’s taking the curves even faster now, closer to the
edge.

. SARAH

We've accomplished what we set out to do.
I think we should stop. It’s. like what
Lirio said, throwing’ things out of
balance. We might get something now, but
we'll pay for it later.

 

NANCY
Are we really having a theological
discussion?!?! It’s fun! It’s scary! Who
cares. what happens?

. SARAH
I just don’t think we should invoke Manon
or the spirit or whatever. It’s... I

don’t want to do it...
(turning to Rochelle
and Nancy in back)

What do you guys think?

Rochelle shrugs. Bonnie takes a long drag from a cigarette
ard glares at Sarah.

NANCY
Don’t try and get them on your side.

es} SARAH

I wasn’t, I just...
 

 

NANCY
Are you part of this circle or not?

SARAE
Of course I am. But I thought it was a
democracy, not a facist regime. And could
you please slow down?

NANCY
Oh... sure...

Suddenly, a pair of headlights’ flashes around a‘corner, Nancy

swerves away. The car SPINS out and slams sideways INTO A
BRICK WALL!

WHAM!! The Girls are thrown around. A window is shattered.

Nancy kicks open her door and jumps out. She pulls the other

Girls out.

NANCY
Anybody hurt?

They all look okay, but the’car looks bad, maybe totalled.

They huddie in the rain, in shock, wondering what to do next.

NANCY .
Oh well. I was getting sick of this
thing... Maybe I’ll get a Range Rover.

Sarah stares at Nancy.

INT. NANCY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Nancy comes in, soaked.

The place is empty.

Nancy hits the jukebox. Connie starts belting out ‘Fallin’.

Nancy sees a note, ‘Went: to Vegas with Greg. Not sure when
we'll be”back. $ in drawer. Mom.’

Nancy looks in the drawer: Some crumpled up twenties.
She pours a glass of wine.
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Nancy sits on the couch across from the juke box, an empty

wine bottle and glass next,.to her.
\

Suddenly she throws the wine bottle at the glass dome over
the turntable.

The dome smashes, the record skips, the machinery SPARKS, and

the juke box dies.

CLOSE UP - A NOTE IS PASSED: “Let’s go to the beach.”
ANOTHER NOTE: “You want a tan?”

ANOTHER: “No, shit-head.”

INT. BIOLOGY LAB - DAY

Nancy and Bonnie are writing notes to each other, Rochelle
passing them back and fourth..

Sarah sits next to them, actually paying attention to the
droning TEACHER. Nancy sees this and leans over.

NANCY
(whisper)
Hey, professor. We’re going on a field
trip.
SARAH
(whisper)
Where? :

NANCY
(whisper)
To the beach. At dawn. For the solstice:

SARAH
(whisper)
I don’t know...
Nancy is incensed. She grabs Sarah arm.

NANCY
What do you mean, you don’t know?!

TEACHER

Miss Downs, I hate to interrupt your
little social. gathering...

INT. HALLWAY - JUST AFTERWARD
The other three face Sarah.

SARAH
Why? What’s the purpose?

 
 

NANCY
We want to give thanks to Manon. Small
sacrifices. Rochelle’s going to offer her
brain. Except that might be too small.

  

Rochelle ignores the remark.
NANCY
Listen, we’re doing this because we think
you're right. We’ve been taking and
taking. It’s time to give back.

Sarah thinks...

INT. BUS - PRE-DAWN . ~

The girls are pensive as the bus makes its way up PCH. The
only other passenger is a SLEEPING WOMAN.

EXT. BEACH - PRE-DAWN

Four black silhouettes file across the sand against the
coloring sky. Breezes flap their clothes.

Rochelle steps in Nancy’ s footprints, Bonnie in Rochelle’s,
Sarah in Borinie’s.

 

Nancy carries a tiny “SNAKE in a jar.
Bonnie, a BUTTERFLY in another jar.
Rochelle, a PARAKEET in a tiny wooden cage.

Sarah, a baggie with a GOLDFISH.

EXT. BEACH -

Bonnie finishes laying a ring of stones in the sand. Nancy
starts a fire in the middle. |

Sarah looks at the snake in the.jar.

SARAH
When I was at my lowest, before I tried
to, you know, kill myself, I thought
everything had turned into snakes.

Everything...

: NANCY
(_) Does it bother you?
N, aa

SARAH

No, it’s small... I don’t care.
 

 

 

NANCY
The serpent is very powerful.

Zach girl places her offering inside the ring and sits.

Iz does bother her. 7 . ,

NANCY
Okay...
(concentrates)
Manon... Ruler of.Earth, maker of waves,

bringer of fire, I present these...

ROCHELLE
We...

NANCY
We present these modest sacrifices...

The Girls each light a black candie. They stand and move ina

circle.

NANCY
Winds of the West, strong and true, aid
us in our magical work on this, the
shortest day, the longest night...

The WIND stirs, blowing the Girls’ hair across their faces.

NANCY
Serpent of old, Ruler of Deep, Guardian
of the Bitter Sea, show us your glory, we
pray of thee, we pray of thee, we invoke
thee...

Sarah is shocked.

NANCY
Come, and show us your glory. Come unto
us... Come unto...

SARAH

This isn’t thanks. You’re trying to
invoke’ him..-

BONNIE
If we told you, you wouldn't have come...

The SUN nears the horizon. Sarah gets up and walks away.

NANCY
Get back in the ring!

Fish are jumping up above the surface of the water.

BONNIE :
I don’t know what you‘re so afraid of...

SARAH
I’m not afraid. °

The GOLDFISH flips and flaps violently.

: NANCY
Please, Sarah...

Nancy holds out her hand.
Sarah slowly comes’ forward. They all clasp hands.

FAR OUT AT SEA - A bolt of LIGHTNING charges down from a
cloud to kiss the ocean. A slow, delayed RUMBLE.

NANCY
Show us your glory...

The PARAKEET beats against the cage, forcing its head through:
slats. : .

The WIND thrashes. them.

 

The SKY turns dark.

NANCY
Manon, we invoke thee!!!!

Nancy's eyes roll back in her head. She falls to the ground.

NANCY
Manon...! Fill me...!

The jars with the SNAKE and BUTTERFLY shatter. The SNAKE
slithers off and the BUTTERFLY is tossed away in a violent
gust.

The wooden cage snaps apart and the PARAKEET flaps free.
The bag bursts open. The GOLDFISH lolls on the sand.
Nancy is thrashing violently.

The ground actually shakes, AN EARTHQUAKE.

tee Saran looks at Nancy, the ocean, the snake. sidewinding away.
nae She feels the ground shaking. She’s awed, terrified.
NANCY
FILL ME!!!!!!
 

 

 

 

Suddenly a huge BOLT OF LIGHTNING DESCENDS ON US, finge
NANCY.

NANCY
AHHH! !!!

Everything turns WHITE -

Then BLACK -

FADE UP -

EXT. BEACH - MORNING, HOW MUCH LATER?

Bonnie and Rochelle are waking from a sleep. Sarah sits
beside them, dazed.

ROCHELLE

(groggy)
Jesus... Was he here?

The GOLDFISH pathetically flaps on the sand.

‘
Sarah gently picks it up and carries it to the water and lets
it go. Then she sees something.

The ocean is calm now. Not a cloud in the sky. And twenty
yards out we see NANCY, i face o water.

Sarah is transfixed.
Rochelle and Bonnie watch as Nancy walks to shore.
NANCY

Did you feel him? He blessed me. He ran
through my veins. I still feel him.

Nancy has a weird detached gleam.

A SIREN. The Girls turn.

UP THE BEACH there is some kind of commotion, CROWDS of

ONLOOKERS, A TV NEWS VAN.: And a COAST GUARD jeep flashing its
chnerry-reds. .

 

The Girls get up to investigate.
IN THE MIDST OF THE CROWD -

We dip down to find... A GREAT WHITE SHARK, dead, eyes and
mouth bleeding, having beached itself far onto shore.

When Nancy sees it, she starts laughing.
NANCY

Beautiful... Fucking beautiful... Look...

 

 

 

WE LIFT UP to see:

ALL ALONG THE COAST, more SHARKS, some even bigger, perhaps
FIFTEEN, all dead, beached, bloody.

NANCY
Manon is great... He loves us... This is
how we know...
Sarah backs away, horrified. She feels nauseous.

Rochelle and Bonnie look blank. But Nancy just keeps
laughing, her eyes glazed over in demented bliss.

. NANCY
Thank you, Manon!

She gets down and kisses the sand.
NANCY
Manon is great!
INT. BUS’- DAY
As they ride home. Bonnie sits by herself.
Sarah WHISPERS to Rochelle:

SARAH
Something’s wrong...

Nancy faces the sun, all of the windows on her side of the
bus down. She takes in the wind, practically drinking it, her
hair blowing around violently.

NANCY
I haven’t felt this good in a long time!

Suddenly all the lights on the bus SPARK and sputter out.
THE DRIVER is freaking. His controls are seizing up.
The BUS swerves.

Nancy smiles at Sarah: a frightening smile.

INT. CAFETERIA - DAY

AMID THE LUNCHTIME CHAOS - We find Sarah eating her lunch
silently, Chris hunched over her shoulder.
 

CHRIS :

hanging with your scary friends. .
She turns to him.

SARAH
Alright... Tomorrow.

He smiles. :

INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT ~— ‘

It’s as nice a place as we can imagine Chris choosing. He
wears a coat and tie. Sarah’s a little underdressed.

CHRIS :
I’m glad we're finally here, together.

It just feels so right... Don't you
think? Don't you feel this incredible
thing going on between us?

SARAH
Chris...

 

CHRIS
Wait, don’t answer. I’m rushing things.

Why did we stop here?

CHRIS
To talk...

He sidles over to Sarah.

SARAH
Chris, I know you feel really strongly,
but have you ever stopped to wonder why?

CHRIS
That’s the thing about love. There's no
way to figure it out.

SARAH
Exactly...

CHRIS
It doesn’t matter. If you're ona
surfboard and a tidal wave is coming, you
ride it.

SARAH
Even if you end up drowning?

CHRIS
(kissing her neck)
I'd drown myself in you, Sarah.
He wraps his arms around her tightly.

SARAH
Chris, take me home.

Long -pause.

CHRIS
No.

He starts to stick his hand inside her blouse. She puils

away, but he’s too strong.

SARAH
Chris, stop it!

CHRIS
NO, GODDAMNIT!!! YOU AGREED TO COME!!!

Sarah is terrified, crying. She controls herself.

. SARAH .
Okay, okay. Just let’ go of my arms.

She kisses him.
He smiles, lets go.

CHRIS
Sarah... I’ve been wanting this so bad.

She reaches to touch him down there. His eyes flutter with
pleasure.

Then she wrenches her face as if squeezing. He HOWLS with
pain. .

She elbows him across the face and he’s. knocked back.
She gets up and runs.

CHRIS
Sarah!!!! What’s the matter with you?

He clutches at his groin.

EXT. BRUSH - NIGHT

Sarah scrambles through the bushes and trees in total

Rochelle runs to the door. Bonnie right behind her

Please don’t. He would have never tried
this, if I hadn't...

NANCY
That’s how they’ve gotten away with it
for so many centuries! She’s a temptress!
She made him do it! Well, that doesn't
work for me! Chris used to grab at me at
parties after the game, drunk,
victorious! And I gave him what he
wanted! And for that he treats me like a
slut!

A glass of water sitting on a table across the room SHATTERS.

SARAH
Nancy...

NANCY -: . . .

We act as one.
She kisses Sarah on the cheek.

Sarah is talking to SOME GIRL who points upstairs.

Gzop.-

Sarah looks over: the black curtain is blowing open, light
spilling from inside.

Lirio takes Sarah's hand.

LIRIO
Come.

. She leads Sarah through the doorway into: |
INT. GLASS COVERED COURTYARD - CONT.

This is an old atrium with hugely overgrown trees and plants
obscuring the light from above except for a small pool of

_ luminescence at the far end, where, in a shaft of afternoon
sun, sits an ANCIENT WOMAN, THe Witch, ‘on an old wooden
chair..She turns to Sarah. She has one milky grey eye and one
eye the color of blood.

She smiles, revealing rows of rotting brown and missing
teeth.

She waves Sarah to come over.

WITCH
Venga aqui, hija. Venga...

Lirio pushes Sarah forward, past the dozens of BIRDCAGES
. hanging from the gnarled bows. There are LIZARDS on the
walls, BUTTERFLIES here and there.

 

The arthritically wrenched HAND of the Witch touches Sarai
cheek. By the way the Witch looks off we know she is blind.

WITCH
Que bonita y joven... No me tema.
Sientase...

LIRIO

(right behind Sarah)
She says don't be afraid. Sit down. She
won't put you in a trance like the other
night when you came through here with th
others...
 

 

Sarah sits at the Witch’s feet. The Witch takes Sarah’s hand
and touches her ring. She laughs, delighted and demented,
babbling on in SPANISH.

LIRIO
: (crasiating)
She: says this ring from your mother tells
her’ many things: your mother was a very
powerful woman, very beautiful and
strong.

More SPANISH from the Witch.
LIRIO
(translating)
She knew many things. But she was afraid
of her own power. And you are too.

The Witch tightens her grip on Sarah, CONTINUING.

LIRIO
She says be strong. The Craft is a
blessing...

SARAH . .
I never knew my mother... But sométimes I

think I remember her...
Sarah is softly crying. Lirio holds her.
Suddenly the place is ripped apart in a BLAST. A huge

FIREBALL pours in through the door from the shop. GLASS falis
from the ceiling. The three Women are rocked to the ground.

  

The wall into the shop has crumbled, the place is on FIRE,
utterly destroyed. .

Then suddenly, the entire scene melds back to i:’s normal

state.
Silence.

Sarah and Lirio are terrified.

A GIGGLE from out front of the shop. A silhouette of Nancy
moves past a window.

SARAH
It's Nancy casting visions.

The old Witch makes a remark.
 

 

 

 

LIRIO
(translating)
She says it’s amateurish work, and she’s
not impressed... But personally I think
it’s pretty good.

SARAH
I’m getting out of here.

The old Witch grabs Sarah's arm, talking to her ernestly.

LIRIO :
She says remember this: no one can use
magi : it 3 5 ;

SARAH

LIRIO
You will understand when you need to.

EXT. ALLEY - DUSK

Sarah runs in the shadows, the sound of SIRENS coming closer.
It’s a bad neighborhood: HOMELESS and GANGBANGERS lurk
everywhere. . . .

She darts into'a street and SCREEECH! a BMW Station wagon
almost hits her.

Inside the car are Rochelle and Bonnie.

BONNIE
Sarah! We’ve been looking for you...

SARAH
(backing, away)
Why?

BONNIE
Sarah, wait. Thank God we found you.
Nancy’s totally out of control. We think
she’s trying to kill you. It’s like she’s
high on Manon or something...

ROCHELLE
At school, we were just trying to scare
you because we were scared. We thought
you were going to tell everybody about
the coven. Sarah... Get in the car...

Sarah isn’t sure.

_. BONNIE
If Nancy finds you...

 
ROCHELLE
We swear on our hearts that we’re not
shitting you.

 

Rochelle opens the door. Sarah comes forward.

INT. BMW - NIGHT
Bonnie drives and Rochelle looks straight ahead.
Silence.

SARAH
Whose car.is this?

BONNIE
My mother’s. I didn’t even teil her I
took it. .
Sarah leans forward into the front seat area.

SARAH
Where are we going?

» ROCHELLE
Where do you want to go?

 

SARAH
Home, I guess.

BONNIE
Are you sure you want to go home?

ROCHELLE
It might not be a good idea.

SARAH
Why?

No answer.

Bonnie presses a button that locks the doors all around.
Sarah leans back, wary.

NANCY is right there, sitting up in the cargo section.

NANCY :
Because I know where you live.

 

Sarah jolts, heart pounding.

Nancy climbs up next to her.

NANCY 40
Sarah? What’s the matter? You don’t look

so good.

Sarah looks in the rear view mirror. Bonnie won’t meet her
glare.

SARAH
What are you going to do to me?

NANCY
This.

Nancy ‘pulls out.an ax, swings it around violently and buries

it in her Sarah’s chest.

Death SCREAM from Sarah.

Then the ax vanishes.
Nancy smiles coyly.
Sarah is hyperveritillating.

NANCY
The question is, what are you going to do
to yourself?

They come to an intersection.
Sarah looks blank.

Suddenly she explodes in movement: SLAMMING her. fist down on
the button to unlock the doors, DIVING out of the car.

Bonnie grabs a leg, Nancy. some hair; but it’s too late. Sarah
slips away. :

Sarah is running up a huge old flight of crumbling stairs
flanking a HILLSIDE.

Bonnie takes after her.
NANCY

Bonnie, nevermind..! She can’t hide from
us.

 

UP THE STAIRS - Sarah is panting, heaving,
the hundreds of steps. She pauses, Looks back.
 

 

 

The BMW peels out.

Nancy HOOTS raucously and it echoes up the hill.

EXT. HILLSIDE ROAD - NIGHT

Hair askew, dirty, exhausted, Sarah trudges up a curving
hillside road.

Headlights hit her from behind.

She moves out of the way. It’s-a WOMAN and a CHILD ina
STATION WAGON. .

SARAH
Please, stop! Please!

The WOMAN lays on the HORN and speeds past her.

EXT. SARAH'S HOUSE - NIGHT

The place looks’ dark and quiet. Sarah limps up the front
walkway.

INT. FRONT HALLWAY -.. NIGHT
Sarah turns the ‘lights on.

SARAH
Hello...?

She checks into the LIVING ROOM, KITCHEN... nobody. She sees
the phone table.

ANGLE - The Yellow Pages are open to the airlines section. On
a small pad are written a FLIGHT NUMBER and a DEPARTURE TIME.

Suddenly the ANSWERING MACHINE kicks on.

SARAH'S VOICE

'SaRAH'S VOICE
(over phone)
...Goodbye... I love you...

 
 

 

 

(laughing, it turns
into...)
NANCY'S VOICE
Pretty good, huh? Your parents must care
a lot about you to just jump on the next
flight. Especially when flying is so
dangerous...

SARAH :
What are you talking about? .

BEHIND SARAH - The TV bursts on playing THE NEWS.
ON THE TV - footage of a devastating PLANE CRASH SITE.
TV ANNOUNCER

...F.A.A.. officials have retrieved the

black box and a full invetigation is

pending. Once again, Global Flight 321

ANGLE - The note reads: “Flight 321 - Global”
Sarah drops the phone. Her eyes flutter.
She falls down, woozy,; but doesn’t pass out. She sits there.
_Dizzy. WE SPIN AROUND HER.
And something else: The lights are FLICKERING. They go OUT.
Quiet, dappled MOONLIGHT through the windows. .

SARAH - Is losing touch, beyond afraid, sick with doom.

She picks up the phone: It’s dead. She presses on the hook.
Nothing.

She gets up, locks the front door and moves upstairs.
INT. SARAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Sarah looks out her window.

Dark and quiet.

The DOORBELL rings.

INT. STAIRS - NIGHT
She slowly tiptoes down the steps.

The DOORBELL again.

 
 

 

 

 

 

ABOVE THE WALL in the staircase, behind Sarah, the shadows of
tree branches sway slightly in the night breeze.

We hear soft HISSING.

 

The TREE SHADOWS gr. -“fully turn into the SHADOWS of GIANT
SNSXES.

Sarah does not see this. —
More HISSING.

She moves to the front door, silently. She peeks through a
side window. There’s nobody outside.

EXT. FRONT PORCH - NIGHT - CONT.

She very cautiosly opens the door. All ‘quiet.

Then: the DOORBELL’ rings again.

ANGLE - The BUTTON IS PRESSED without anybody pressing it.
Saran’s eyes go wide. \

She backs away.towards the street, backing down the front
steps, then stops. :

' She’s Standing on something strange. HISSING.

She looks down:, She’s standing on SNAKES, dozens of them.

The CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal the front walkway, the lawn,
the sidewalk, the street, are all composed of a HUGE TEEMING

‘MASS OF THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF SNAKES.

it's an ocean. It completely surrounds the house.
Sarah turns very slowly. She sees it all.

She starts shaking.

She can’t catch her breath.

The SNAKES hang from the trees. They cover a CAR. They Pour
out of a mailbox.

A snake starts to spiral up her leg towards her inner thigh

SARAH
No...

She shakes the snake off and tips forward onto the safe haven
of ‘the porch and back into the house.

INT. FRONT HALL - NIGHT - CONT.
 

 

 

 

Sarah robotically comes in, closes and locks the door.
Faint girl GIGGLING.

Sarah turns and runs into the

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT - CONT.

LOOKING OUT THE KITCHEN WINDOW - i i i ed_of
snakes, just like the front.

At.the front door, something is POUNDING.

Sarah runs out.

INT. FRONT HALLWAY - CONT.

The front door is BOWING with the monstrous force of a huge
creature pounding with all its might. POUND, POUND. Sarah
sees through the window the silhouette if SOMETHING INHUMAN.

SARAH

She backs-up the stairs. She ducks into

INT. HER ROOM - CONT.

She locks her door, shoves her dresser in front.

We hear the front door break down - SMASH!!!
Huge FOOTSTEPS coming up the stairs.

Deep, inhuman BREATHING (we‘ve heard ‘it before).

The doorknob turns. A massive body POUNDING.

Sarah runs into

INT. HER_BATHROOM - CONT.

We hear furniture THROWN out of the way, SMASHING.

POUND! The wooden slats on the bathroom door splinter. POUND!

Sarah,. backs up, panicked, out of ideas.

She backs into her shower, closes the door, huddiing in the
corner, on the wet tiles.

SMASH!! The bathroom door shatters.
 

 

 

THE BUMPY SHOWER GLASS - We see a massive BEAST,
snched, BREATHING deep resonant breaths.

  
 

_ THROUGH
vague, }

It sees Sarah in the shower, moves to her.

It moves close to the glass.

The door opens.

As the glass passes, the shape turns into Nancy, grinning.

NANCY
Gotcha.

ON SARAH - It really makes no difference to her now. She’s
shifted into another mode: cornered animal.

Nancy leans in close.

NANCY
You know... if I were you, I’d kill
myself.
Nancy's hand is reaching for something... the shower handle.

She turns it on full blast.
Nancy slips. away.

Sarah just sits there getting soaked until finally, .slowly,
she gets up and out of the stall.

Totally doused and dripping, she walks out.

There are no broken doors, no signs of the Huge Beast.
BEDROOM - CONT.

All is normal.

Except... ON THE DRESSER - The black and white photo of
Sarah's Mother in the garden.

IN THE. PHOTO - The trees are ‘swaying gently: Sarah's Mother
looks up and calmly smiles at us. Sarah moves on.

HALLWAY - TOP OF THE STAIRS -
Sarah comes out, looks.down numbly, starts down the steps.
INT. LIVING. ROOM - NIGHT

She comes. in and stands in the middle of the room. we are
MOVING AROUND HER.

Light and shadow.
 

 

 

An empty chair. GIGGLING. Now Rochelle sits there.
Light shifts. Now Rochelle is over by the window.

SARAH
..-Where are my dad and Jenny?

NANCY
Oh. You'll be seeing them soon.

ROCHELLE
As soon as you kill yourself.

An empty archway.
Sarah looks: Bonnie in the archway now.

SARAH
No.

Nancy dips down from a shadow over Sarah’s head, floating.

NANCY
What are you waiting for?

Now she's gone.
: SARAH
(softly)
I’m not going to kill myself.:.

BONNIE
What was that?

Now a huge BOA CONSTRICTOR is gracefully and silently
lowering itself from the ceiling, unseen by Sarah.

SARAH
I don’t want to kill myself.

NANCY
You don’t sound too sure.

Suddenly the SNAKE coils around Sarah's neck and wraps
around.

Her eyes bulge and she paws at the SNAKE but it’s too tight.

It starts to lift her off the ground by the neck.. Her feet
kick violently.

The SNAKE MORPHS INTO A ROPE. Sarah is being hung py the
neck.

Nancy watches.
aed

 

Sarah gives a silent scream as her neck SNAPS.

She falls to che ground.

No snake. No rope. She kneels there choking, rubbing her
neck. :

 

NANCY . |
If you don’t want to kill yourself, then
why are you fantasizing about it?

SARAH
I’m not fatasizing about it....,

BONNIE
Why doesn’t she use magic on us?

NANCY
Because she knows it won’t work.

SARAH
(remembering)
No one can use magic against you if you
do not let them.

NANCY .
That's right. :
(chanting,
monotonous)
Now is the end: Let her go in peace.

ALL THREE
Now is the end. Let her go in peace.
Now is the end. Let her go in peace.
Sarah gets up.
SARAH
There’s nothing behind that. Your chant
is empty. It has no power over me.

Sarah looks OUT THE WINDOW - The landscape is normal, without
a single snake.

Sarah walks to the front hall.

NANCY
Come back here.

Just as Sarah pulls open the door she is met by Roger, Jenn
and A FAMILIAR WOMAN.

SARAH
Dad...

She throws her arms around him.
 

 

 

ROGER
Sarah, we were so worried.

SARAH
I’m alright now. I mean, really alright.

He looks in her eyes.

. ‘ROGER
I want you to meet someone.

The Woman comes forward.

ROGER
Sarah, this is your mother.

Sarah looks at her, in shock, not understanding.

MOTHER
Hello, Sarah.

She hugs Sarah who is speechless,’ on the verge of. tears.

SARAH
How...?
MOTHER
{smiling)

You're dead. We all are.
Sarah pulls back to get another look at her, but it’s NANCY,
who kisses Sarah on the lips, then pushes her down on the
floor.
The front door SLAMS CLOSED.

NANCY
You're not leaving.

Nancy leans down in front of Sarah.

NANCY
Give me your hands.

Without thinking, Sarah does. And before she can even react,
Nancy has taken the Exacto knife and zough Sarah's

wrists.
Blood runs. Sarah stares at ict.

SARAH
It’s not real...

NANCY
The fuck it isn’t.

Lt9
Nancy smears the blood up her arm. . I

SARAH
No...

She gets up and runs to the door, but Rochelle is there to
block it.

Nancy grabs a pen and starts writing a note.
NANCY
(reading aloud) mo,
“I killed Chris. I’m sorry. Love, Sarah”

Nancy puts the pen and the note in Sarah’s hands, and she
drops them.

ON THE FLOOR - The note and the pen are smeared in blood.

NANCY
Thanks. That's perfect.

Sarah runs upstairs, panicked, bumping into the wall.

NANCY
I wish she would relax.

INT. SARAH'S BEDROOM - CONT.

She bounds in, holding her wrists out, bumping into a dresser
and knocking the PHOTO of her mother off the table.

The glass cracks.
She stumbles into
THE BATHROOM -

Where she opens the medicine cabinet. She fumbles for some
bandages, but the box only has a few small band-aids.

Sarah slips to the floor, crying, hopeless.

She sees the photo on the floor. She crawls to it, touches
the glass. She thinks.

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Nancy and the girls are sitting there. Rochelle and Bonnie
look very glum.

ROCHELLE
I was just thinking...

NANCY :
Please. I’m not in the mood for any of
your stupid-ass comments.

ROCHELLE
You know, I’m really not that stupid.

NANCY
Oh? Then exactly how stupid are you...?
Jesus. Go upstairs and see if she’s dead
yet.

ROCHELLE
You didn’t say please.

NANCY
Do it now, or I’ll fucking kill you!

Nan¢y lunges at her. Afraid, Rochelle gets up.

ROCHELLE
Bonnie, come with me.

She meets up with Bonnie.

BONNIE

INT. SARAH’S. BEDROOM - CONT.
They see blood drips and smears on the floor.

. ROCHELLE
Gross.

‘BONNIE
She was in here.

The drips lead over to double doors. Rochelle opens them to
reveal

A LONG, STRANGE-LOOKING HALLWAY. -
With flickering sconces.

ROCHELLE
I don’t remember this...

They step forward.
 

 

 

DOWNSTAIRS - WITH NANCY - CONT.
We hear distant SCREAMS.

. NANCY
Bonnie...? Rochelle...?

She goes upstairs.
INT. SARAH’S ROOM - NIGHT

Following the drops of blood, she goes to the double doors,
opens them, seeing the HALLWAY.

Nancy stops. She picks up a book and throws it into the
hallway.

The BOOK vanishes, causing a soft gash. The IMAGE OF THE
HALLWAY DISSIPATES like fog.

Nancy turns around.

NANCY
Nice try... Actually it was a pretty lame

try.

Then out of the bathroom comes a SCREAMING bloody Sarah,
shoving Nancy out the double doors.

Nancy flies out into the darkness.
And then... silence.

Sarah creeps forward and peers into the BLACK.

A CRACK of THUNDER and the skies FLASH, illuminating Nancy

who lies motionless on the pavement, her neck is at an
impossible angle.

Rochelle and Bonnie are climbing out of the bushes nearby.
A BREEZE stirs the trees.

A HORN honks.

EXT. FRONT OF HOUSE - NIGHT

Roger and Jenny are getting out of a TOWTRUCK. Sarah comes
out the front door, walks right up and hugs her father.

BONNIE
Hi.

 

ROCHELLE
How are you?

Sarah just stares at them.

BONNIE
Well, um, okay... We want you to know
that we’re really sorry about your wrists
and all. And it wasn’t our idea to try |
and kill you. And we hope you can forgive
us.

. ROCHELLE
And you were totally right about not
“abusing the craft. Not that it really
matters anymore. We lost all- our
