INT. TALBOT HOUSE, BEDROOM (VICTORIAN PERIOD) -- NIGHT

—S EE EEE EEE UEC TORIAN PERIOD) ~~ NIGHT
THUNDER RUMBLES and LIGHTNING FLASHES...

YOUNG LAWRENCE, a raven-haired youth, 10 years old, sits up
in his bed, looking fearfully to the darkness.

INT. TALBOT HOUSE, HALLWAY -- NIGHT

With the STORM HEARD raging outside, Young Lawrence peers
out into the HALLWAY. A man's ANGUISHED CRY is HEARD, but
it's lost in the SOUND of THUNDER. Was it imagined?

Young Lawrence, in a night~-shirt, starts tentatively down
the long, dark hall of this opulent, Victorian MANOR HOUSE.
LIGHTNING illuminates many big game, ANIMAL HEAD TROPHIES
mounted one-after-another: TIGER... ELEPHANT... LION...
Young Lawrence walks, trying to ignore the freakish tableau.
DOWN THE HALL

Young Lawrence slows, looking ahead to... a DOOR ajar.
LIQUID pools out from beneath, like black molasses.

Young Lawrence moves to push the DOOR OPEN...
IN THIS MASTER BEDROOM

A MAN is slumped on his knees, weeping, cradling the FIGURE
of a WOMAN. He lets out another CRY of anguish!

YOUNG LAWRENCE
Father... ?

The man, SIR JOHN TALBOT, 40, looks to see Young Lawrence.
Sir John is in agony, tears streaming down his face.

The cradled WOMAN'S ARM falls free, dangling limply, the
wrist slit; gashed wide with BLOOD FLOWING to the floor.

Young Lawrence stumbles back in horror...

Falling against his older brother, BENJAMIN, 12, arriving in
the doorway. Benjamin, likewise terrified, raises a bright
OIL LANTERN to the room just as BOOMING THUNDER is HEARD!
EXT. TALBOT HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS -- NIGHT

The stately MANSION and surrounding countryside are glimpsed
in brilliant LIGHTNING. THUNDER ECHOES as we...

SOAR UP into the TEMPEST! CAMERA Z00MS: through and beyond
roiling STORM CLOUDS... to find a FULL MOON shining down.

CLOSE ON: a stage-craft FULL MOON backlit by flickering
gaslight within a painted BACKDROP of crooked trees and grim
sky. INTO FRAME steps handsome LAWRENCE TALBOT, mid-30's.

To be or not to be. That is the
question. Whether 'tis nobler in the
mind to suffer, The slings and arrows

Lawrence walks to centerstage, passionate eyes gleaming.

LAWRENCE
Or take arms against a sea of
troubles, And by opposing end them.
To die: to sleep. No more; and by a
sleep to say we end...

IN THE AUDIENCE: wealthy WEST-ENDERS watch, enthralled.

While on the near STREETS, THEATER-GOERS pour noisily out
from the THEATER into filthy, loud, over-crowded Londontown.

INT. THEATER, DRESSING ROOMS -- NIGHT
eee ONEGHT

A boisterous PARTY is HEARD from the other room. Lawrence
sits at his DRESSING TABLE, in costume, pouring two stiff
DRINKS. He hands one to a tawdry COCKNEY LADY beside him.

LAWRENCE
Over the lips and through the gums...

They drink. Cockney Lady laughs, already drunk. Lawrence
pours again while Cockney Lady paws at him amorously. A
fatherly, ELDER ACTOR, American, enters from a curtained
CHANGING BOOTH, pulling on his jacket, watching them.

CONT INUED
ELDER ACTOR
A few cocktails, Lawrence?

LAWRENCE
A few.

ELDER ACTOR
Too many?

LAWRENCE
Et tu, Brute?

ELDER ACTOR
No. Indulge, by all means. Just do
not forget yourself.

Lawrence toasts his own REFLECTION in his MIRROR.

LAWRENCE
I make no promises.

ELDER ACTOR
The occasion is in the other room.
Bring your new... friend.

Elder Actor exits. Lawrence extricates himself from Cockney
Lady's grasp, kissing her hand as he stands.

LAWRENCE
Excuse me, dear, while I dress.

COCKNEY LADY
Dress. Undress. Whichever you like.

She smokes. Lawrence begins changing from his COSTUME.
Behind, the DOOR opens as a lovely woman, GWEN CONLIFFE, 30,
looks in, nervous. She KNOCKS, clears her throat.

GWEN
Begging your pardon, sir... I...

Lawrence is taking off his SHIRT as he looks over.
Gwen is stunningly beautiful, in a nice, though plain,
DRESS. She tries to avert her eyes from his shirtlessness.

GWEN
I'm... terribly sorry, but... you are
one Mr. Talbot?

LAWRENCE
Correct.

GWEN

Mr. Lawrence Talbot, actor?
Lawrence pulls on a SHIRT, buttoning.

LAWRENCE
Correct again, and while normally I'd
be so happy to make. the acquaintance
of an admirer as lovely as yourself...
(of Cockney Lady)
..-tonight, as you can plainly see...

GWEN
You misunderstand me.

LAWRENCE
Do I? Well, make it quick. I'm
about to have my hands full.

GWEN
I've come from Talbot Hall. West
Blackmoor. My name is Gwen Conliffe.
Betrothed to Mr. Benjamin Talbot.

Lawrence regards her with a new seriousness.

Gwen nods.

Gwen makes way as Lawrence shows Cockney Woman out the door.

LAWRENCE
My brother's fiance?

Lawrence considers, looks to Cockney Lady.

LAWRENCE
A moment alone, please...

COCKNEY LADY
What's all this about?

LAWRENCE
Go entertain yourself. I'll collect
you momentarily.

LAWRENCE
So, Miss Conliffe... what brings you
here tonight?

GWEN

You've had no letter from Benjamin
lately, though you expected one.
Forgive my reading them, but your
last correspondence with him told me
you'd be in London now.

(troubled pause)
The reason there's been no letter...
Benjamin is gone. He's disappeared.

LAWRENCE
Disappeared?

CONT INUED
GWEN

For almost a month now, without a
trace. And there's been a killing in
Blackmoor; an unspeakable murder.
All the while, a certain woman is at
the center of it. Because of her,
propriety forbids me from saying
anything more.

(pause)
I come to ask for your help.

 

LAWRENCE

My father. He knows you came?
GWEN

He knows.
LAWRENCE

He asks this? My father?
GWEN
I ask. I pray you will return to
Talbot Hall. }

Lawrence turns away, sullen, slowly shakes his head.

LAWRENCE
I cannot.
GWEN
You must. Please. How... how can I
express what heartache it's been...?
LAWRENCE

Tonight was our last performance
before returning to New York. !
Besides which, whatever this is... i
what help could I be in any of it?

GWEN
With respect, where else would you
have me turn? It is your family in
dire need of you.

LAWRENCE
I'm sorry you've wasted your time.
For my own reasons, I will never go
back to Blackmoor. I'm afraid that's |
my final word.

Gwen stares sadly down in weary despair.

GWEN
Well, then. There's nothing more to
say. Except thank you for hearing
me, Mr. Talbot.

CONTINUED
Lawrence watches as Gwen crosses. She halts at the door.

GWEN .
I know you've been away for nearly a
lifetime. Still... he is your blood.
Your only brother.

Gwen goes, SHUTS the DOOR. Lawrence stands alone, miserable.

Lawrence, in his Hamlet COSTUME, walks these swampy MOORS
amidst a heavy FOG. MIST swirls as he reaches out.

LAWRENCE
Hello...?!

Ahead, within a CIRCLE of huge, weathered and ancient STONE
MONOLITHS jutting upwards from the ground, Lawrence nears...
A lone MAN in rural attire, standing with his back to us.

LAWRENCE
Benjamin, is that you? Ben...?

As Lawrence approaches, the MAN TURNS to REVEAL...

A FACELESS VISAGE of unbroken flesh stretched ‘taut across a
SKULL of empty EYE SOCKETS and gaping maw!

INT. LODGING ROOM -- NIGHT

Lawrence awakens, aghast, sweaty. He sits up, looking
beside him to Cockney Lady who lies facing away.

LAWRENCE
Lord... what a dream. You awake?

Cockney Lady GROANS sleepily, stirring...

LAWRENCE
I dreamt I was in a fog, and...

Cockney Lady TURNS, showing a GHOULISH SKULL-FACE devoid of

features -- SHRIEKING -- her TEETH GNASHING!
INT. LODGING ROOM -- DAWN

Lawrence awakens for real this time, sweaty, gasping.

As he looks to Cockney Lady who lies facing away beside him,
he scrambles from the bed, backing fearfully to the wall.

 
 

EXT. LODGING HOUSE ROOF MOMENTS LATER -- DAWN
A ROOFTOP HATCH is thrown open with a THUD. Lawrence climbs :
a LADDER out onto the flat ROOF, wearing clothes he's thrown

on. He takes out and lights a CIGARETTE, inhales deeply.

Lawrence goes to the roof's edge. He takes out a BOTTLE,
drinks. He stares across the dark London CITYSCAPE set
against the aborning, orange SUNRISE. His mind is troubled.

LAWRENCE
(under his breath)
Damn you, Father. Goddamn you.

Lawrence angrily flings the BOTTLE at the horizon.
it's HEARD SHATTERING far off, shards HEARD scattering.
A distant TRAIN WHISTLE SOUNDS, growing LOUDER...

The TRAIN WHISTLE SOUNDS from inside the STATION. We find
MEMBERS of Lawrence's ACTING TROUPE unloading many large
TRUNKS of "Atherton Traveling Theater Co." belongings from
WAGONS. STATION ATTENDANTS help transport the TRUNKS inside.

Other ACTORS slap Lawrence on the hack, wishing him well, as
Elder Actor comes to firmly shake Lawrence's hand.

ELDER ACTOR
We'll do the best we can without you.
It's right this; you going home.

LAWRENCE
No home of mine, but I'm going. Hard
to believe, one long day's journey
takes me back 20 years.

ELDER ACTOR
Good luck. See you in New York.

Lawrence nods, waves as he crosses the STREET...

This is post-Industrial-Revolution London, with the SOUNDS
of INDUSTRY echoing in the sooty air; London as the center
of the universe. Streets bustle with hurried GENTLEMEN and
LADIES, shouting HAWKERS, dirt-poor WAYWARD YOUTHS and
BEGGARS. As Lawrence reaches a waiting four-horse CARRIAGE,
the DRIVER opens the passenger door. Lawrence climbs in.

Lawrence peers pensively out the WINDOW...

Scanning the bleak and forbiddingly vast MOORS. Low, wild

The STONE MONOLITHS from Lawrence's nightmare command an
area of high ground. Cawing BLACK CROWS congregate.

EXT. BLACKMOOR ROAD, FURTHER ON -- DUSK

The driver guides Lawrence's carriage onward.

Beyond near FIELDS, a GYPSY ENCAMPMENT of TENTS and WAGONS
has settled an open area bordered by FOREST. CAMPFIRES
burn. GYPSIES lead HORSES, carry WATER and skin wild GAME.
IN THE GYPSY CAMP

At one exotically decorated WAGON, an ancient, female
fortune-teller, OLD MALEVA, steps out, sensing something.

Stooped Old Maleva hobbles purposefully across the
encampment, past other TRIBE MEMBERS who respectfully make
way. She reaches a vantage point from where she can SEE...
The DISTANT ROADWAY where Lawrence's carriage is passing.
Old Maleva's piercing eyes narrow, fixated.

With the carriage heading away in the B.G., Lawrence sets

down his TWO SUITCASES. He gathers his nerve, straightening
his clothing and hair. Hesitant, he KNOCKS, entering...
INT. TALBOT HOUSE, GRAND HALL -- NIGHT

The DOOR CREAKS, as Lawrence enters.
He passes through the wood-paneled ENTRY PARLOR, CROSSING
into the giant, Victorian-Gothic GRAND HALL.

It's a cavernous room, with walls covered floor-to-ceiling
in TAPESTRIES, PAINTINGS and all manner of displayed
WEAPONRY; RIFLES, LANCES, SHIELDS and crossed SWORDS.
Across the way, two STAIRCASES combine at a LANDING to lead
up to the West and East Wing BALCONIES of the second-story.

Lawrence crosses, FOOTSTEPS ECHOING. There is a look and
feel here of cobwebby, frayed-edged, smoke-darkened gloom
and decay, as there will be everywhere throughout Talbot
House. Gothic indeed. Everywhere, magnificence wanes.

Lawrence comes to stand before the Grand Hall's massive
FIREPLACE, staring up at the OIL PAINTING hanging above...
A PORTRAIT of his MOTHER; a youthful, olive-skinned beauty
standing on the moors, her dress and raven hair flowing.

MAN'S VOICE (0.S.)
"I will arise and go to my father,
and I will say unto him...!"

Ris reverie broken, Lawrence turns to see...
Grey-haired, dashingly handsome SIR JOHN TALBOT, mid-60's,
striding down the STAIRCASE, his mellifluous voice booming.

SIR JOHN
"Father, I have sinned against
heaven, and before thee! And I am no
more worthy to be called thy son;
make me as one of thy hired servants!"

Sir John reaches the bottom of the stairs, followed by his
ioyal DOG, an old hunting hound, SAMSON. Sir John is an
imposing presence; a WELL-DRESSED man of the gentry, despite
the odd worn cuff here and loose seam there.

SIR JOHN
And lo and behold, here he stands: [
the Prodigal Son returned. Shall I i
have my own robe brought to be placed
upon your shoulders? Rings for your
fingers and shoes your feet? Shall
I kili the fatted calf?

LAWRENCE
Don't go to any trouble on my account.

SIR JOHN
Come, let me see you. Let me look at {
what kind of man you've become.
Lawrence walks to face Sir John, clears his dry throat. i

CONTINUED

LAWRENCE
Hello, Father.

SIR JOHN
Lawrence.

They look at each other, no more than ten feet between them,
silence hanging like a challenge. A chilly reunion.

SIR JOHN
Words fail me. When your telegram
arrived to say you were coming, I
couldn't bring myself to believe it.
I've grown so accustomed to thinking
I would never lay eyes on you again.

LAWRENCE
As have I.

Sir John SMILES wryly, walks to cross the vast room.

SIR JOHN
Of course, to be clear... it wasn't
my idea to send for you.

LAWRENCE
I wouldn't have imagined so.

SIR JOHN
Not that you're not welcome, of
course! We'll make room for you...

(to his :DOG)

-+-won't we, boy? It's only that...
I simply can't help wondering...

Sir John yanks a dusty, tasseled BELL PULL several times.

SIR JOHN
What difference could possibly be
made by your being here? A fair
question, I think.

Lawrence considers, restraining his anger.

LAWRENCE
I'll do whatever I can, I suppose, to
aid my missing brother...

SIR JOHN
How noble you are!

LAWRENCE
Although, knowing so little yet, how
can I give the answer you seem to
want from me, Father?

CONT INUED

SIR JOHN
Let me be the one to enlighten you.

Sir John turns on his heel, SHOUTING, so his VOICE ECHOES..

SIR JOHN
KENDALL!

Where in the hell...?

Entering through one ARCHWAY beneath the STAIRS, comes the
balding and pasty butler, KENDALL, exasperated.

KENDALL
Yes, Sir John, yes. Here I am.

SIR JOHN
Wonderful, Kendall. Lawrence here
will be our guest for... however
long. Take his things up. Have Gwen
meet us in the drawing room.

In the dark, cluttered, high-ceilinged DRAWING ROOM, Sir
John pours much SCOTCH into TWO GLASSES on a LIQUOR TRAY.

SIR JOHN
Blackmoor's troubles began the day
the wandering caravan arrived. Late-
winter, ten months ago.

Lawrence looks up at ANIMAL HEAD TROPHIES, SAFARI PHOTOS,
and WORLD MAPS adorning the walls. Sir John places one
drink on a TABLE near Lawrence, goes to sit in a CHAIR by
the blazing FIREPLACE which Samson lies near.

SIR JOHN
The Gypsies are quite willing to make
a living from us; telling fortunes,
trading and peddling goods. But,
since many villagers still believe
all Gypsies to be witches, a distance

is kept. Although... it is rumored
that, amongst the gentlemen of
Blackmoor...

Lawrence looks at one PHOTOGRAPH: of YOUNG LAWRENCE and
YOUNG BENJAMIN standing with MOTHER and SIR JOHN.

CONTINUED

 
12.

SIR JOHN
Some men of questionable morals, upon
a hunting excursion, or out for an
evening's constitutional, may
discreetly make their way to the
Gypsy encampment. There they are
welcomed to partake of wine, women
and song. Well... maybe not song.

At the DOORWAY, Gwen gives a small cough, entering timidly.

There's no denying her fair beauty. Samson goes to her.

GWEN
Good evening.

Sir John stands to be polite...

SIR JOHN
Hello, Gwen.

-..and immediately sits back down. Lawrence gives a nod.

LAWRENCE
Hello.

GWEN
I didn't expect you'd come.
Please... don't let me interrupt.

Gwen pets Samson. She crosses to a corner, looking small.

SIR JOHN
Six weeks ago, a Gypsy named Victor;
a blackguard and thieving criminal,
finished serving a lengthy prison
term in London. He returned to the
tribe, only to find his Gypsy wife
far along in a pregnancy.

LAWRENCE
The child was not his?

SIR JOHN
His absence was too great. And so,
this Victor dragged the unfortunate
woman, Carmilla, into the village.
He brought her before our Justice of
the Peace, saying Blackmoor parish
owed him justice.

A CLOCK begins CHIMING. 7:00. Sir John stands.

SIR JOHN

Seven o'clock already. We must leave.

ON THE LAWN, ahead, a STABLE BOY brings THREE HORSES.

LAWRENCE
Why would this husband go outside his
tribe? Unless, he felt the village
did the wrong to him.

SIR JOHN
Exactly. Victor had beaten a
confession out of his wife. She told
how her secret lover was one of the
men of Blackmoor.

GWEN
She will not say who it is.

SIR JOHN
For which she's spent the last month
and a half jailed; to be held until
she tells his name.

LAWRENCE
You still haven't said what all this
has to do with Benjamin.

Gwen's troubled, unable to bring herself to say it. .
Lawrence sees this. Sir John is likewise saddened...

SIR JOHN
Benjamin is suspected.

LAWRENCE
As the father? It cannot be true.

SIR JOHN
Squire Strickland has called a Public
Hearing for tonight. I must be there
to speak for your brother.

Sir Lawrence and Gwen go to take their horses' reins.
Sir John climbs ably up onto his great, WHITE STALLION.
Stable Boy gives Gwen a boost as she mounts her horse.

SIR JOHN
You can still ride can't you,

Sir John and Gwen ride towards the ESTATE ROAD. Sighing,
Lawrence takes his horse, climbs expertly on. He rides.

imprisonment, there was a killing...

SIR_ JOHN
The peasantry claim a devil-creature

Carmilla; or was conjured by those
Gypsies sympathetic to her plight.
GWEN
They say a Loup-Garou stalks the
witching hour of the full moon.

LAWRENCE
A werewolf? Are you serious?

CONTINUED
SIR JOHN
Whoever committed the murder did so
to stir superstitious fears, in the
hope that Carmilla would be set free.

GWEN
It was one day after the killing,
when Benjamin went missing.

SIR JOHN
Found gone, some of his clothing and
belongings taken. As if he'd fled.

LAWRENCE
And he said nothing before he left?
He gave no indication...?
GWEN
No, he... he said nothing.
Lawrence watches her, senses something. She averts her gaze.
LAWRENCE

Are you certain?

GWEN
He said nothing.

SIR JOHN
The longer he's gone, the more rumors
spread and fester. So, tonight...
to defend Benjamin means defending
the gypsy Carmilla.

As the DOOR of the JAILHOUSE opens, an O.S. CROWD is HEARD
REACTING. The very pregnant Gypsy, CARMILLA, in SHACKLES,
bewitchingly lovely déspité her pale, ailing appearance, is
lead out by the gorillalike JAILER. Sir John follows, grim.

The CITIZENS of Blackmoor pack the lamp-lit, COBBLESTONE
STREETS of the SQUARE; mostly poor, peasant FARM FAMILIES.
Some SHOP WORKERS, LABORERS and SERVANTS. An awesome
GUARDIAN ANGEL STATUE -- wings spread, SWORD raised --
Stands at the crowd's center. SHOP OWNERS watch from the
DOORWAYS of the bordering TAVERN and STOREFRONTS. WIVES and
DAUGHTERS lean out 2nd-story, residential WINDOWS.

ON THE JAILHOUSE STAIRS

Carmilla is lead down a few steps, facing the crowd, her
green eyes fearful. Sir John follows to stand with her.

At the JAILHOUSE DOOR: out struts the haughty magistrate,
SQUIRE STRICKLAND, 60, long-haired, immaculately bedecked.

 

IN THE SQUARE

Lawrence and Gwen climb the tiered BASE of the ANGEL STATUE
to stand where they can see over the gathering.

Behind the crowd, in the open-air FORGING WORKSHOP of his
BLACKSMITH SHOPPE, the brawny, Irish blacksmith, JAMES
FITZGERALD, comes to watch. He's soot-covered, in a leather
APRON. His WIFE joins him, cradling their infant CHILD.

ON THE JAILHOUSE STAIRS
Strickland surveys the crowd, raises a hand. CROWD QUIETS.

STRICKLAND
My friends... we all know why we are
gathered here.
(pointing down)
This man has suffered an injustice...

IN THE SQUARE

AT THE FRONT OF THE CROWD, given wide berth by VILLAGERS,
stands VICTOR, Carmilla's thuggish, Gypsy husband, wearing
an EYEPATCH. He's flanked by Old Maleva, the fortune
teller, and BELA, the gaunt, waxen-skinned Gypsy Chief.

ON THE JAILHOUSE STAIRS

STRICKLAND
A great wrong was done to him. Done
by this woman... his own wife!

Carmilla hangs her head, her features bathed in cold sweat.

STRICKLAND
She carries a bastard child conceived
in the sinful act of adultery.

IN THE SQUARE

The CROWD MURMURS, agitated. Beneath the TAVERN'S "Sword of
God" SIGN, several of the town's more elderly and most
wealthy GENTRY stand watching: the distinguished DOCTOR
LLOYD; the broad-shouldered, walrus-moustached COLONEL

MONTFORD; and the wizened, dour-faced PASTOR FISK. Other
plump, drunken LAND OWNERS stand amongst them, DRINKING.

ON THE JAILHOUSE STAIRS
Strickland plays to the cheap seats always.
CONTINUED |
STRICKLAND
She refuses to say who in Blackmoor
Village is the father. Why is that?
Has it something to do with the full
moon evening, when blood and gut were
spilled onto the moor!? And what
about the note; secretly nailed to
this very door in the dead of night
one day later...?

  

Strickland thrusts out a PIECE of PAPER...
A scrawled NOTE and DRAWING of a PENTAGRAM: "RELEASE HER
OR OTHERS DIE"

STRICKLAND
A threat made against us all, with
the next full moon tomorrow!

IN THE SQUARE

Beyond the ANGRY CROWD, lanky CONSTABLE NYE (seen in the
FLASHBACK) arrives on his BICYCLE, PIPE in mouth.

ON THE JAILHOUSE STAIRS

STRICKLAND
Who made the threat? For us to find
the truth, she must confess her
fellow adulterers name!

As the CROWD VOICES assent, Strickland glances to Sir John.
IN THE SQUARE :

UNDER THE STATUE, at the CACOPHONOUS center of the SHOUTING
CROWD, Lawrence and Gwen look around in despair.

ON THE JAILHOUSE STAIRS

Sir John steps forward, facing the gathering, raising his
hands. The CROWD begins QUIETING, respectfully.

SIR JOHN

Please, if I may...! You all know

me. You know the Talbots have and
always will be one of the pillars of
this community. JI am an honorable
man. As such, I must ask again... by
what law, Squire Strickland, is this
woman held, when adultery is no crime?

STRICKLAND
Yes, well... I'm not surprised you'd
like to see her freed and forgotten,
Sir John. Wasn't it your son said to
have frequented the Gypsy camp?
(more)

 
 

CONTINUED
18.

STRICKLAND (CONT.)
Your son; Benjamin, who was witnessed
in heated arguments with this woman,
and who visited her while she was
jailed...?

SIR JOHN
What kind of man are you, to make
such accusations against my son?!

STRICKLAND
These are facts, not accusations.
The crime is economic! Should this
forgiving husband be left unfairly
responsible for the financial burden
of the bastard child? I think not.

SIR JOHN
That is the reason you pretend so you
may exert your puritanical will. You
wish to disgrace whoever dared to
have relations with a lowly Gypsy!
So you overstep the bounds of your
authority by jailing her, while you
slander my family's good name!

STRICKLAND
If that is what you truly believe,
let the debate be opened to all...
{addressing the CROWD)
If there is anyone who also feels
this woman is.the aggrieved party,
say so now! Make yourself heard!

SIR JOHN
Except who would dare speak against
you, aS you are principal landowner
and Justice of the Peace?

STRICKLAND
Nonsense. Yes, many are indebted to
me... but everyone knows I am a fair

and open-minded man. They know they
can speak freely, so...

(addressing CROWD)
Again; if you side with her, as Sir
John does, speak! You think I am
unjust? I Beg you, raise your voice!

IN THE SQUARE

UNDER THE STATUE, Lawrence and Gwen look to the surrounding
crowd as EVERYONE grows HUSH.

AT THE BLACKSMITH SHOPPE, James Fitzgerald watches,
empathetic. He sets his jaw, steps forward, about to speak...
His WIFE reaches to stop him. He sees the fear in her eyes.

CONTINUED
AT THE TAVERN, the GENTRY exchange sheepish looks (except
stone-faced Fisk), knowing they will not speak out.

ON THE JAILHOUSE STAIRS

In the silence, Carmilla shuts her eyes, shedding a tear.
Strickland, arms out, turns to Sir John.

A telling silence. Deafeningly so.

Sir John can say nothing more, solemnly defeated.

My brother is innocent!

IN THE SQUARE

EVERYONE TURNS en masse, looking...
UNDER THE STATUE, Lawrence stands at Gwen's side.

LAWRENCE
I am Lawrence Talbot, and I would
stake my life that Benjamin is not
the father. Whoever is... can't you
see she's trying to protect you...?!
(imploringly, to VILLAGERS)

How can you keep silent while she
suffers this way, all to save you
from harm? I beg you, reveal yourself

ALL AROUND Lawrence and Gwen, not one person speaks. No one.
ON THE JAILHOUSE STAIRS

STRICKLAND
Another heartfelt, familial plea.
Alas, met aiso with an empty sound.
(turns to Carmilla)
If she will not tell, so be it! We
hold her longer still!

As the Jailer steps forward...
Carmilla stands, in shackles, tearful.

CARMILLA
No! No more! I'll tell...

The GASPING CROWD returns all attention to Carmilla.
CARMILLA
I'll tell you all! I'll keep the
secret no longer!

The CROWD'S QUIETING as Carmilla looks to the apprehensive
Sir John. She wipes tears, looks out, gathering courage...

AT THE BASE OF THE STAIRS, Victor's enraged, charging up the ;
Stairs towards Carmilla! The Jailer steps up to block the ° :

Strickland's smiling, triumphant. He nods...
The Jailer walks to take Carmilla's arm, pulling her up the
steps. Sir John bows his head, stricken, despairing.

IN THE SQUARE
UNDER THE STATUE, Lawrence and Gwen are stunned.

GWEN
No! It's... it's not true.

Gwen climbs down, distraught, PUSHING through...

Lloyd and Colonel Montford sit at a TABLE, drinking. Other
fat LAND OWNERS smoke, drink and whisper amongst themselves.

COLONEL MONTFORD
Tomorrow comes the full moon. Do you
let the whore go or not?

DOCTOR LLOYD
If I'm permitted to speak in my good |
friend Sir John's defense...

The BARKEEP serves more BOOZE. Sir John is seated by the |
FIREPLACE, staring into his MUG, brooding forlornly. i

STRICKLAND |
You needn't defend anyone, Doctor. i
We're all on the same side. I more i
than anyone wish Ben would appear. |

You know how it looks, Sir John.
There are those who believe
Benjamin's hiding away, till she's
released and the gypsies go. Even
more think he is the murderer...

Still, it does seem your crusade has
reached its end, Squire, with the man
she's implicated nowhere to be found.

BARKEEPER
I know where he is! You want to
know?! That lost soul's spellbound
in her curse; out in the wilderness
somewhere, living like a mad
animal... till the full moon calls
him again to do her red work! You'll
see, tomorrow night!

CONSTABLE NYE
Please do keep that supernatural
claptrap to yourself!

PASTOR FISK
No. There may be something to it.

EVERYONE looks to spooky Pastor Fisk, QUIETING.

PASTOR FISK
The devil is able to touch our world.
There are Such demons that walk like
men, and men who walk like demons.

Silence lingers, the FIRE HEARD CRACKLING.

DOCTOR LLOYD

Well, I'm not certain what that
means, but if she's still jailed by
the Quarter Sessions, there'll be
hell to pay. Beg pardon, Pastor Fisk.

(to Strickland)
She's made the confession you
demanded, hasn't she?

COLONEL MONTFORD
The note said others will die!

DOCTOR LLOYD
Yes, Colonel, but we don't know who
left the note, who did the murder, or
even if they are the same person!

STRICKLAND
Enough. Enough!
(sighing deeply)
Let the full moon rise and fall. If
there's no other killing, Carmilla
will be released to her husband. He
may deal with her however he sees fit.

SIR JOHN
And the child? What if it is truly
my grandchild she carries?

STRICKLAND
What of it? Once this is done, the
tribe will move on. Feel free to
follow them if you like, but they
will be Blackmoor's problem no longer.

Lawrence rides his horse through low FOG, carries a LANTERN.

Ahead is the fine FRAMEWORK of a far-from-finished HOUSE at
forest's edge. Lawrence dismounts, bringing the lantern.

INSIDE THE FRAMEWORK, Gwen stares up to the STARRY SKY.

LAWRENCE
My father said I might find you here.

GWEN
Welcome to... our house. Not yet a
home. On the farthest edge of the
your family's estate. I used to
iaugh that this is as far as I could
get Ben to move from Talbot Hall.

LAWRENCE
Further than I would have expected.

Gwen smiles faintly, looks back up. The surrounding WOOD
FRAMING describes a large, simple TWO-STORY STRUCTURE.

GWEN
Not that there's been much work on
it. Not lately.

LAWRENCE
He'll be back. He will.

Gwen's sad, wanting to believe. They walk.

GWEN
Thank you for what you said tonight.

LAWRENCE
I meant it. He was and always will
be the good brother. The good son.
Unlike myself.

OUTSIDE THE FRAME, Gwen and Lawrence walk with the
unfinished house behind them, open FIELD before them.

GWEN
I confess, after meeting you in
London, I didn't... hope for much.
From your behavior. Your drinking,
and that... woman. I...

LAWRENCE
Yes. Well, I may be more than I
first appear. Or less.

They stop, looking to the distant LIGHTS of the GYPSY CAMP.

LAWRENCE
You claimed Benjamin said nothing
unusual before he left. Is that the
full truth of it?

Gwen looks at him, uncertain what to say.

LAWRENCE
Whatever you're hiding, I hope you'll
trust me enough soon to tell me.

Behind, a HORSE SNORTS. Lawrence and Gwen turn, startled...
Old Maleva and Bela are there on horses, like eerie specters.

LAWRENCE
Hello? What do you want?

Old Maleva rides closer. Bela slowly circles, eyeing them.
Lawrence steps protectively in front of Gwen.

OLD MALEVA
You. You are the young Talbot?

LAWRENCE
In a manner of speaking.

OLD MALEVA
You should return to wherever you are
from. The path you're on leads to
the end of you.

LAWRENCE
(unnerved, sarcastic)
As much as I'd like to take your
advice, I'm afraid I can't.
Lawrence is keeping an eye and lantern on Bela. Bela stops.

GWEN
You are the fortune teller?
OLD MALEVA
Maleva the Seer.
GWEN
Then, see his brother.... my fiance,

Benjamin. Please tell us where he is.
Old Maleva's piercing eyes fix on Gwen a moment.
Suddenly, Old Maleva yanks her horse's reins, riding off.
Lawrence aims his lantern up at Bela's glowering face.

LAWRENCE
You don't say much, do you?

Bela kicks his horse, riding to follow Old Maleva.
Lawrence and Gwen watch. Old Maleva halts, turning back...

OLD MALEVA
I will ask the spirits. If they know
of your brother... I will find you.
Old Maleva rides to follow Bela away into the night.

Old Maleva stands with Carmilla's husband, Victor.

Lawrence enters. A utilitarian DESK and CABINETS are
located across from THREE empty, metal-barred CELLS. Sir
John, Constable Nye and Squire Strickland stand at the first
open CELL, where Doctor Lloyd kneels. Jailer's in the B.G.

DOCTOR LLOYD
She was cold as the grave. The baby
was motionless inside her.

A NECKLACE Carmilla wore lies on the floor, its AMULET open,
like a locket, with RED POWDER spilled out from inside it.

DOCTOR LLOYD
There is a remnant of the Gypsy
poison here, whatever it is.

Lawrence approaches as Doctor Lloyd rises.
Sir John moves past, stepping away, lost in thought.

DOCTOR LLOYD
It might have been passed to her by
someone in the tribe. She might have
had it with her the whole time.

CONSTABLE NYE
Why? Why kill herself now?

STRICKLAND

Who knows? Abandoned by Benjamin.
Deathly afraid, I'm sure, to face her
husband's wrath. Whatever her
reasons, there's no question she took
her own life.

(considering)
Good riddance. To her and all of
them.

Sir John slowly turns. He strides back towards Strickland...
Sir John PUNCHES Strickland! He SWINGS again, but he's
grabbed by Lawrence and Doctor Lloyd, held off.

Strickland recovers, furious, nose bloodied.

STRICKLAND
What the devil... !?

DOCTOR LLOYD

How will he ever return to prove his
innocence now?! Tell me that.

untucked shirt bears the TALBOT FAMILY CREST on its pocket.

SIR JOHN
Ah... Mr. Talbot, Esquire. Just the
gentleman I'm looking for...

Sir John rises. Lawrence remains by the door.

LAWRENCE
Are you alright?

SIR JOHN
I've been meaning to ask you.
Explain again exactly how it is you
make your living. Pretending you're
someone else? Playing at life? How
bloody appropriate...

LAWRENCE
You should rest, Father. You've
probably had enough to drink today.

Sir John DRINKS. He SLAMS the table with the bottle, drags
the bottle along the table as he walks the length of it.

SIR JOHN

What wouldn't I give... to have it be
you the one missing instead. You do
know that, don't you?

Lawrence swallows hard, refusing to let out his sorrow.:

LAWRENCE
Of course I do.

SIR JOHN
Until yesterday, you were missing.
So forgive me if I doubt I'll begin
to rely upon you at this late date.

LAWRENCE
Yes, sir.

SIR JOHN
You are your brother's opposite.
Never worth a damn. You're not even
man enough to stand up for yourself,
are you? Say something. Don't just
stand there. Defend yourself,
goddamn you! Defend yourself!!

Lawrence just clenches his jaw, tears welling up.
Sir John's spent, pulls out a CHAIR to sit. Stares forward.

SIR JOHN
Get out of my sight.

Lawrence turns to leave, falters upon seeing...

He puts the gun back, straightens his hat, nervous.

Nye RIDES off through the SQUARE, circling the ANGEL STATUE.
Streets are deserted. SHOPS are CLOSED. WINDOWS SHUTTERED.

In some of the SECOND STORY WINDOWS, a few VILLAGERS peer

MANY RIFLES are propped up by the FRONT DOOR.

Gwen enters to find Lawrence looking up at his MOTHER'S
PORTRAIT. After a moment, Lawrence turns to see Gwen.

GWEN
Tell me about her.

LAWRENCE

(looks to PAINTING)
The kindest soul. Without equal.

(remembering)
We spent endless hours together in
this very room. Playing music...
reading books aloud, and plays.
Acting out favorite scenes. She was
able to fill this house with warmth,
if you can imagine.

GWEN
What happened? I mean... do not say,
if you feel you cannot. It's just...
Ben and your father refuse to speak

Lawrence looks to Gwen, his mood darkening.

ANIMAL HEAD TROPHIES (familiar from the OPENING SCENE) .

something liquid on the floor.

Lawrence steps up, uses one finger to push the DOOR OPEN.

LAWRENCE
My father held her as she died.
She'd killed herself. Slit her

wrists. Blood was... everywhere.

I never even knew why she did it.
GWEN

Lawrence, still lost in remembrance, descends with Gwen.

LAWRENCE
There's a lot I don't remember. My
mind was affected, they say.

I spent months in an insane asylum,
in London. Father sent me. Till I
could cope with my mother's death.

They return to the GRAND HALL. Gwen's listening, saddened.

LAWRENCE
In that nightmare; the asylum... I
lived strapped down. Drugged. Lost
amongst the screaming mad. It truly
was a hell. That much I recall.

I was returned home, "cured." I
lasted five more years till I ran

Yes, it's one thing if this man-beast
comes from... out there somewhere...
(WAVING to the distance)

Quite another if it is amongst us.

Lloyd and Strickland share a look, mulling this unhappily.

COLONEL MONTFORD

Could be anyone. Could be someone's
cursed and doesn't even know it.

A werewolf... he's the worst

and beast; killing not for food or in
self-defense, but for killing's sake.

Sir John and Lawrence arrive, dismounting.

STRICKLAND

Half the village has left for the
city already. Everyone who remains

is at each other's throat.

DOCTOR LLOYD

I stitched up five drunken brawlers
in the village last night alone.

LAWRENCE
No more word from London?

STRICKLAND
No officer has hurried to take
Constable Nye's position, not
surprisingly, considering the manner
in which it was vacated.

SIR JOHN
London sends promises of help; never
the help itself. We're on our own.

DOCTOR LLOYD
They most likely think us mad. TI
think us mad, so why shouldn't they?

STRICKLAND
Yes, it all seems laughable in the
light of day, but wait till when the
full moon returns.

All the men nod, agreeing. Kendall nods, still serving.

COLONEL MONTFORD
On that midnight hour, the shadow of
the monster will fall upon us again.

SIR JOHN
I can't help wondering how different
things might be except for the
actions of certain persons.

STRICKLAND
(bristling)
If you refer to certain persons who
are still unaccounted for, I'm
inclined to agree.

Sir John looks likely to swing again. Strickland stands.

LAWRENCE
Stop this, please.

DOCTOR LLOYD
Quite. We've all of us ended up in
this together. Leave it at that.

Sir John backs down, fists clenched. He walks, going off to
watch the continuing RIDING and PISTOL TARGET-PRACTICE.

LAWRENCE
We'll be ready. Whatever creature it
is will be defeated.

They look to see it is the brawny blacksmith, Fitzgerald,
riding across the lawn. He arrives, dismounting...

FITZGERALD
Greetings, sirs.

STRICKLAND
Afternoon, Mr. Fitzgerald. What have
you brought us?

FITZGERALD
What was contracted, but let me take
an appreciation of this moment...
that such fine gentlemen would be
eagerly awaiting the arrival of my
lowly self. Can't imagine another
circumstance will ever provide me
with the same celebrity.

COLONEL MONTFORD
Get on with it, man!

FITZGERALD
At your service, Colonel...

Fitzgerald unties TWO, heavy LEATHER BAGS from his saddle,
lugs them over to the table. Everyone stands.

FITZGERALD
Blessed by Pastor Fisk...

Fitzgerald overturns one BAG onto the Blackmoor MAP...
Spilling out MANY gleaming SILVER BULLETS.

FITZGERALD
Said to be all that's good for
killing werewolves.

They all look upon the bullets with a kind of reverence.
Lawrence reaches to pick up one SILVER BULLET, examines it.

LAWRENCE
Have we all gone mad? Is this just
some kind of... mass hysteria?

DOCTOR LLOYD
What happened to the good Constable
was real enough.

STRICKLAND
If the only thing silver does that
lead can't is steady the hand of the
man firing the gun, that's still
enough for me. Let it be silver.

ACROSS THE LAWN, Sir John watches as...
One PEASANT rides, SHOOTING at the targets, missing most.

Nicely done, son. Excellent.

The significance of those words is not lost on Lawrence.

LAWRENCE
Thank...thank you, sir.
(offers PISTOL back)
You taught me well in my youth. I'm
still surprised I retained any of it.

SIR JOHN
Of course you did. You're a Talbot.
It's in your blood.

EXT. FARM FIELD / UNFINISHED HOUSE -- DAY

 

Lawrence rides, holding the reins of Gwen's horse to guide
it since Gwen rides while holding her hands over her eyes.
As they cross the FIELD, 0.S. HAMMERING is HEARD.

GWEN
How much further? Can't I look yet?

LAWRENCE
Have some patience.

GWEN
Patience? You've kept me away for
weeks. I'm fed-up with patience!

Gwen's grinning, amused. Lawrence is pleased.
They travel a little further. Lawrence dismounts, going to
help Gwen down. He guides her a few steps, positions her.

LAWRENCE
Okay. You may look.

Gwen finally lowers her hands, opening her eyes...

They stand before Gwen's now nearly complete 2-STORY HOUSE.

The outer STONEWORK and WOODWORK are almost finished. Only

a few WINDOWS are in place so far and LABORERS are still '
working on the ROOF, but it's very nice indeed.

GWEN
Oh... oh, my, it's... beautiful.

Overwhelmed by emotion, Gwen turns to wrap her arms around
Lawrence's neck, KISSING his cheek. Lawrence is surprised.
Gwen releases him, immediately realizing, blushing.

GWEN
Forgive me. I... I didn't mean to...
I was only...

LAWRENCE

Gwen. There's nothing to forgive.

Now, please, if you wouldn't mind...
(smiling)

Why don't you go in? See for

yourself. This is your home.

Gwen nods. She looks upon the house a long moment.
Tears come to her eyes. Lawrence sees, his smile fading.

GWEN
My home... and Ben's.

Gwen walks to the house. Lawrence watches her go inside, :
absently reaching to touch his cheek where she kissed him. :

cur TO:
INT. TALBOT HALL, GWEN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT
Gwen stirs under her BEDCLOTHES, having trouble sleeping.
INT. TALBOT HALL, LAWRENCE'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

Lawrence lies in his BED, wide awake. A SOUND is HEARD from
somewhere; like a CREAKING DOOR. Lawrence sits up.

IN THE HALLWAY

Lawrence looks out, pulling on a SHIRT. FLOORBOARDS CREAK.
IN THE GRAND HALL

Lawrence comes to look over the BALCONY railing...

BELOW: the LIGHT of a LANTERN heads down one HALLWAY
underneath the stairs, casting SOMEONE'S lengthening SHADOW.
Lawrence finds this very strange, heading downstairs.

INT. TALBOT HALL, CONSERVATORY -- NIGHT

Lawrence enters, looking across the expansive, empty
CONSERVATORY. Glinting LANTERN LIGHT from outside Plays
across the sweeping GREENHOUSE WINDOWS .above.

Lawrence quickly crosses, his breath fogging a WINDOW as...
LAWRENCE'S POV -- THROUGH WINDOW

Sir John can be seen, in a heavy COAT, using the LANTERN to
make his way across the manor's neglected, hillside GARDENS.

IN THE CONSERVATORY
Lawrence backs away from the window, perplexed.

GWEN'S VOICE (0.S.)
Lawrence?

Lawrence spins to see Gwen crossing towards him.

GWEN
Who was that? {

Lawrence puts a finger to his lips.

EXT. TALBOT HALL, REAR GARDENS -- NIGHT

Lawrence and Gwen follow Sir John's path through the GARDENS
CONT INUED
AHEAD, Sir John's LANTERN LIGHT heads into the dark FOREST
nearby, throwing erratic SHADOWS.

Lawrence nods forward, offering his hand to Gwen.
Gwen hesitates for the merest moment, then she reaches to
take Lawrence's hand and they hurry after Sir John.

IN THE FOREST

Lawrence and Gwen, still holding hands, travel a PATHWAY
through the foliage. Sir John's FIGURE and his LANTERN'S
GLOW can be seen far ahead. Lawrence and Gwen slow as...

They reach a CLEARING surrounded by wrought IRON FENCING.

It is the Talbot family GRAVEYARD. Generations old. At
least 30 HEADSTONES. At center stands a large, ornate TOMB.
THREE new CANDLES BURN in the melted wax on the steps of the
tomb where many a candle has burned before.

Lawrence releases Gwen's hand as they solemnly approach.
The FLICKERING LIGHT off the candles dances across the
tomb's elaborate CARVINGS, ILLUMINING the LIKENESS of
Lawrence's MOTHER'S FACE, her eyes shut, etched in the
GRANITE of the TOMB DOOR. Below are the WORDS...

"Anna Talbot, beloved wife and mother. Taken by tragedy."

Lawrence backtracks to the TRAIL, looking ahead to where..
The whole of the forest is DARKNESS. No sign of Sir John.

CUT TO:
INT. TALBOT HALL, DRAWING ROOM -- MORNING
Sir John sits staring into the cold FIREPLACE, brooding,
petting Samson at his side. As it often does, his SHIRT
bears the TALBOT FAMILY CREST. Behind, Lawrence enters.
LAWRENCE
Father. I saw you go out last night.
Followed you, actually, to the forest.

SIR JOHN
Why didn't you join me?

LAWRENCE
I lost sight of you.

SIR JOHN
I couldn't sleep. Wandering the
woods quiets my mind's anguishing.
Sir John stands. Samson walks over to lick Lawrence's hand.

LAWRENCE
There's... there's no truth, is
there, to the rumor that Benjamin may
be hidden nearby? Looked after by
someone? Perhaps... somehow
afflicted.

SIR JOHN
No. There is no truth to it.

Sir John crosses to stand close to Lawrence.

SIR JOHN
With all that's befallen this
household of late... I've been

meaning to put into words some...
expression of gratitude.

LAWRENCE
You're trying to say thank you?

SIR JOHN
Yes, yes. That said, when the time
comes tonight... I don't care what
you have to do; what excuse you have
to make... you must not participate
in the hunt.

LAWRENCE
You're not serious?

SIR JOHN
Don't ask me to explain. Just do as
I tell you. There will be plenty of
us out there without you...

LAWRENCE
You... you know I cannot...

SIR JOHN
I ask this one thing of you, as your
father. This once, heed my word!
(trying to calm)
With your brother still gone, you and
I are all that remains of this
family. If anything were to happen
to me... you may very well be the
last to carry on the Talbot name.
(pause, commanding)
Ride out if you must, but break off
from the group. Return here to hide.
Just stay away, you hear? Stay away!

Sir John walks, exiting. Lawrence is left bewildered.
Samson BARKS up at him, goes to follow Sir John.

EXT. FOREST / WATERFALL -- DAY

Lawrence and Gwen stand at a CLIFF'S EDGE, facing the
incredible view beyond the steep drop. Across the ROCKY
CHASM, a slender WATERFALL cascades.

GWEN
Some days, I expect to see him riding
up to Talbot Hall. Others, I know in
my heart some terrible fate must have
befallen him.

(pause)
More often now, I think Benjamin
simply... left. Moved on to start
some other life without me...
LAWRENCE
No.
GWEN
Perhaps with someone else.
LAWRENCE
No.
GWEN

We don't know. We may never.

LAWRENCE
I have something for you. Forgive me
for not giving it to you sooner...

Lawrence takes out an old, folded ENVELOPE from his jacket
pocket. He takes a LETTER from the envelope.

LAWRENCE

You already know Ben and I wrote each
other when we could. This letter,
from last year... I've carried it
with me since. He wrote...

(READING from LETTER)
"Her family, of Reeves Lane,
Londontown, visits often with friends
here. Her name is Gwen. Gwen
Conliffe. She is so fair as to take
your breath away. I only wish
somehow you could meet her, my
brother, to see with your own eyes
how I have been blessed."

Gwen listens, greatly affected by Ben's words.

"I am in love. I can tell only
you... I plan to ask her hand in
marriage.

able. Bleak as the situation may '
seem... don't give up hope.

 

lawrence offers the letter. Gwen accepts it, grateful. j

LAWRENCE
We should head back.

They walk INTO THE FOREST, leaving the beautiful WATERFALL.

GWEN
Why carry it? Why this letter?

LAWRENCE
I realized, long ago... by running
away; by taking my freedom, I denied
Benjamin any chance at his own. I
shackled him to my father. And Ben,
in his goodness, stayed behind to be
my father's son all these years.

GWEN

I don't believe he saw it that way.
LAWRENCE

He knew nothing else... had no other

option, because of me. His whole

life, he barely even stepped foot :

outside of Blackmoor. |
(pause) i

That letter showed that Ben's destiny i

did find him. You. You are the

happiness I was afraid he might never |

know. i
EXT. FOREST / CASTLE RUINS -- DAY
=— eee eee Re an DAY

Still DEEP IN THE FOREST, Lawrence and Gwen return to where '
their TWO HORSES are tied to a tree. The impressive RUINS

of an ancient CASTLE stand on this site. The castle's

crumbling BATTLEMENTS and tall TOWERS are broken away in !
places to reveal cross-section views of cavernous ROOMS and |
STONE STAIRWELLS, all overgrown and tangled with vines.

LAWRENCE
Kendall will take you with him into
the village tonight.

CONTINUED
47.

GWEN
I can stay at Talbot Hall if you
leave me a weapon.

LAWRENCE
Alone? I'm afraid that's out of the
question. The safest place for you
will be with everyone else.
FROM INSIDE THE RUINS -- SOMEONE'S POV...

...WATCHES Lawrence and Gwen. Someone is LOOKING OUT from
the RUINS as Lawrence helps Gwen climb up onto her horse.

IN THE FOREST CLEARING

Lawrence now climbs onto his own horse.
The SOUND of FALLING STONES causes him to look back...

ON THE RUINS, FRAGMENTS of aged STONE tumble from beneath a
dark HOLE high on one tower. No one in sight.

FURTHER DOWN THE FOREST TRAIL -- MOMENTS LATER

 

As they ride, Gwen studies Lawrence.

GWEN
People have begun to talk, that we
spend so much time together.

LAWRENCE
Let them talk. They enjoy talking.

Lawrence smiles. Gwen smiles.

GWEN i
How is it you are so very unlike the i
man I first met? I still can't {
reconcile it.

LAWRENCE

If I can't reconcile it, how can you i
expect to? i

(off Gwen's look) i
I am an actor. Sir John said it...
that I "play at life." Onstage; the
hero, the lover, or the clown.
Offstage; the cad, numbed by drink
and promiscuity. Who I am truly...?

(pause)
Anyone but myself.

Well, I like you fine, Lawrence
Talbot. Whoever you are.

Nightfall. FOG rolls in. A THRONG of the village's
CITIZENS makes its way to the CHURCH. Pastor Fisk stands by
the ENTRYWAY, watching everyone file up the STAIRS.

ON VARIOUS SURROUNDING ROOFTOPS, armed MEN are stationed.

Amongst the CROWD of weary and wary VILLAGERS and FARM
FAMILIES making their way into the sanctuary (many men
bearing FIREARMS), we may recognize blacksmith Fitzgerald's
WIFE carrying their INFANT. A fretful Kendall escorts Gwen.

AT THE DOORWAY, Gwen looks unhappily back, then goes inside.

EXT. OVER BLACKMOOR -- NIGHT

Low in the inky sky, a FULL MOON burns brilliantly.

EXT. TALBOT HALL, FRONT DOOR -- NIGHT

by Dr. Lloyd. They walk, both carrying RIFLES.

DOCTOR LLOYD
Your father and I have been friends
for, well... more years than this old
man cares to count. I was there,
Lawrence, when you came into this
world. And over these past weeks
even in the midst of everything...
I'm glad to have made your
acquaintance.

LAWRENCE
Likewise, Doctor.

DOCTOR LLOYD
I believe you've been a great comfort
to John. He'd tell you himself, I'm
certain... would that he were capable
of such sentiment.

Doctor Lloyd and Lawrence share a rueful smile.

LAWRENCE
I'm sure you're right.

They walk on, continuing to...
THE GREAT LAWN

Where a breeze carries the undulating, thickening FOG.
In the light of many LANTERNS, THREE HUNTING PARTIES gather,

all heavily armed.

Each PARTY consists of FOUR or FIVE PEASANTS/HUNTERS on
horseback; ONE HOUNDSMAN, on foot, each restraining FOUR
HOUNDS on short leashes; along with...

...Sir John and Fitzgerald heading up PARTY ONE; Strickland
and Col. Montford leading PARTY TWO; and finally, Lawrence
and Dr. Lloyd joining PARTY THREE. All are on their HORSES

SIR JOHN
I've been here many times before. On
the savannahs and in the jungles of
the Dark Continent. I have a feeling
you will learn what it is to pit
yourself against a worthy adversary
tonight. Remember... never
underestimate your prey.

STRICKLAND
This fog complicates matters, to say
the least. If, as legend claims, the
werewolf strikes at midnight...

As everyone begins to MOVE OUT...
Sir John makes sure to pass close to Lawrence, staring him
down, while Lawrence tries to pretend not to notice.
Each group begins heading in a different direction.

EXT. BLACKMOOR FORESTS -~ NIGHT
Deep in bleak, foggy FOREST, Sir John's hunting party slowly

moves through, following their Houndsman and dogs. Before
long, the hounds begin BARKING excitedly.

The Houndsman looks nervously back to Sir John.
Sir John holds up one finger.

The Houndsman releases one dog, which goes RUNNING...
Quickly disappearing in the fog.

Sir John, Fitzgerald and the Hunters ride to give chase.

BARKING, avoiding TREES and ducking BRANCHES in the mist.
They charge down a HILLSIDE, halting as they come upon the
hound barking and growling at a large, impenetrable BRAMBLE.

their Houndsman and his rooting hounds across the open
ground of the heath. From across the moors: the HOWL of the
WEREWOLF is HEARD, not far away.

The hounds go crazy.

All in the party react, wide-eyed.
Strickland looks to the terrified Col. Montford.

EXT. FOREST'S EDGE -- NIGHT

Elsewhere, Lawrence and Dr. Lloyd's group traverses a FIELD,
leaving FORESTS at their back. The WEREWOLF'S long, almost

The dogs bark wildly, straining at their leashes.
Strickland, Col. Montford and the others struggle to control
their jittery horses. Another HOWL is HEARD, very near now,
just beyond the enveloping blanket of fog.

COLONEL MONTFORD
Saints preserve us! It's here!

STRICKLAND
(to the Houndsman)
Now, man! Loose them!

The Houndsman obeys, letting his hounds free...
All four dogs race off together, gone from sight in the mist.

Strickland's party LISTENS, weapons at ready as...

Unseen in the miasmic gloom: the HOUNDS are HEARD BARKING as
they converge; GROWLING furiously as they're ATTACKING
something! From the SOUNDS of the ensuing, violent
STRUGGLE, there comes the savage ROAR of the WEREWOLF!

The DOGS YELP, being slaughtered...being silenced.

FROM THE FOG: one DOG'S mutilated BODY is THROWN...

Landing with a bloody-wet THUD before the spooked horses!
FROM THE FOG: a lone, surviving hound SPRINTS OUT, fleeing.
Strickland raises his PISTOL -- SHOOTING! Col. Montford and
the others join -- BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! -- FIRING blindly into
the fog bank where the hounds were killed.

STRICKLAND
Hold your fire! Wait!

Everyone stops shooting. Listening.
The WEREWOLF'S ROAR comes from elsewhere, farther.

STRICKLAND
It's on the run! Come on!

Strickland rides towards that last roar...

Followed without hesitation by the four other Hunters.
Leaving only Col. Montford gaping down at the ripped-up
HOUND bleeding-out on the ground before him. i
Col. Montford decides, turning his horse, retreating.

Doctor Lloyd climbs down from his horse, going to a nearby
BODY lying face down. Lawrence runs over just as Dr. Lloyd
turns the CORPSE. It's a dead HUNTER from Sir John's party,
covered in blood, eyes and mouth wide, his face CLAWED.

DOCTOR LLOYD
One of your father's men!

Lawrence stumbles back, swallowing sickness, dismayed.
The HOWL of the WEREWOLF is HEARD, distant.

LAWRENCE

You men, ride on to the moors. Go!

Their five fellow Hunters obey, riding.
Lawrence pulls his PISTOL, striding onward, gun in one hand
and lantern in the other, searching the forest.

PULLING DOWN the Hunter to Strickland's right!

Strickland and the remaining Hunters ride on, oniy just

realizing... seeing the now riderless horse amongst them.
STRICKLAND
No!

advancing quickly on SOMETHING barely seen in the gloom...
The BEAST is hunkered over the HUNTER'S prone BODY!

As Strickland SHOOTS, the BEAST leaps away! Gone.

Strickland halts his horse, looking upon the eviscerated,
dead HUNTER whose SEVERED ARM lies near.

ELSEWHERE ACROSS THE MOORS

Col. Montford rides, glances back, spurring his horse on.
He thunders past an old, crooked SIGN without noticing it...
Over SKULL and CROSSBONES: "Keep out! Dangerous bog!"

FURTHER ON, Col. Montford's glancing back once more when his
horse suddenly SPLATTERS into the BOG -- tripped up and
falling -- THROWING Col. Montford!

Col. Montford lands with a SPLASH in swampy QUAGMIRE !

He gasps, rolling onto his belly, knee-and-elbow-deep in the
muck. He looks up to see his horse, nearer the bog's edge,
splashing its way to solid ground.

COLONEL MONTFORD
No! Come back here! Come back!

The horse runs off. Col. Montford looks around, begins
struggling to extricate himself, desperately afraid.

INT. FOREST -- NIGHT
Lawrence and Dr. Lloyd are on foot, calling out...

LAWRENCE
Father!

DOCTOR LLOYD
Sir John!

They soon come upon another grisly discovery...
One more HUNTER from Six John's party, lying dead on his
back; half of him, actually, since his LEGS ARE GONE .

DOCTOR LLOYD
What Hell have we wandered into?

A GURGLING CRY is HEARD ahead. Lawrence and Dr. Lloyd look,
running towards the sound. Someone's lying half-propped up
against a tree...

It's Fitzgerald, bloody and barely alive, clutching his
RUPTURED throat. Lawrence and Dr. Lloyd fall to their knees
peside him. Fitzgerald tries to speak, unintelligible.

LAWRENCE
We're here, Fitzgerald, we're here.
Can you help him, Doctor?

Fitzgerald GURGLES urgently at Lawrence, brings up his
hand, in a fist, trying to give Lawrence SOMETHING.

LAWRENCE
Isn't there anything we can do?

Dr. Lloyd sadly shakes his head. Fitzgerald makes a last
attempt to speak, BLOOD BUBBLING from his lips. His eyes
roll up. With a final, rattling gasp, he slumps.

EXT. THE MOORS -- NIGHT

One HUNTER SLAMS the ground, holding his BLOODY FACE as...
He's DRAGGED AWAY, his foot caught in his horse's stirrup.

NEARBY

Strickland turns his horse, hearing the SOUND of that MAN'S
SCREAMS traveling out there in the fog. GUNSHOTS echo.
SOMEONE else is YELLING, followed by the WEREWOLF'S ROAR!

Strickland's unnerved, looking all directions...
Not far away, the grouping of STONE MONOLITHS is vaguely
silhouetted. Strickland rides there.

AMONGST THE MONOLITHS

Strickland rides to the center of the ancient, ceremonial
circle. The WEREWOLF'S ROAR nears. The FIGURE of the
WEREWOLF materializes, MOVING quickly, outside the circle.

Strickland SHOOTS between the monoliths, targeting the
elusive BEAST, till the revolver's EMPTY.

Strickland leaps down from his horse, pulls his RIFLE and
AMMO BAG from the saddle. He SLAPS his horse's flank, sends
the horse running. Strickland shoulders the rifle...

He turns, peering down the sight; keeps turning and aiming,
frantically trying to cover all possible entry points.
FROM BEHIND: the SHAPE of WEREWOLF appears, CHARGING
straight at the oblivious Strickland...

Strickland is THROWN, flailing -- SMASHING with bone-
crushing force against one of the immutable monoliths!

He crumples limply to the ground. Certainly dead.
ACROSS THE MOORS

IN THE QUAGMIRE: the more Col. Montford struggles, the
deeper he sinks. He's in nearly up to his waist in the
grasping muck, terror and exhaustion taking their toll.

COLONEL MONTFORD
Help! Someone! Help me, please!

The only answer...the WEREWOLF'S HOWL. Montford gives a SOB.
INT. FOREST -- NIGHT

Dr. Lloyd places his jacket over Fitzgerald's corpse.
Lawrence notices something peculiar, kneeling.

He takes a PIECE of CLOTH from Fitzgerald's fist.

Lawrence stands, studying the frayed piece of CLOTH.
We DO NOT SEE yet what Lawrence is looking at, but Lawrence
is Shaken, Tooking at it in disbelief.

DOCTOR LLOYD
What is it? Lawrence?

Lawrence closes his hand on the cloth, his mind racing.

DOCTOR LLOYD
What's wrong?

LAWRENCE
That night, Doctor... the night
Constable Nye was killed. You and
Colonel Montford left Talbot Hall
together with my father...

DOCTOR LLOYD
Yes, yes...

LAWRENCE
You... you said, that when you all
got back to the village, the
constable was already dead...

DOCTOR LLOYD
Yes, he was.

LAWRENCE
(urgently)
Tell me you were never apart from my
father that night! Tell me that you
were with him until the morning!

DOCTOR LLOYD
No. No, we...we had split up
earlier, to cover more ground...

CONTINUED
5é.

Lawrence is mortified, chilled by this revelation.

DOCTOR LLOYD
We did meet up again in the village,
but as I'd said, it was almost dawn
by the time we all got there. What's
this about?

Lawrence runs to where their horses are tied...
He scrambles up onto his horse,. RIDING away.

DOCTOR LLOYD
Where are you going?!

ON THE MOORS, AT THE BOG

Col. Montford struggles in the mire. It's hopeless.

The WEREWOLF is HEARD ROARING. Col. Montford pulls his
muddy PISTOL, trying to turn his body, trying to take aim.
FROM THE FOG: the SHAPE of the WEREWOLF materializes.
Col. Montford points his gun, blubbering. The WEREWOLF'S
guttural, O.S. BREATHING is HEARD growing CLOSER. Col.
Montford's hand is SHAKING badly. He tries to steady the
gun in both hands, tears streaking down his dirty cheeks.

COLONEL MONTFORD
No...no...no...no...no...

The gun WOBBLES so wildly in his grip as to be useless.
As the 0.S. WEREWOLF GROWLS, Col. Montford decides...

COLONEL MONTFORD
No, Goddamn you! NO!

Montford jams the gun in his mouth, frightened out of his
mind, pulls the trigger -- BLAM! -- literally out of his
mind as BRAIN and GORE EXPLODE out the back of his head.
EXT. TALBOT HALL -- NIGHT

Lawrence rides pell-mell across the GREAT LAWN...

Taking his horse straight up the front STAIRS of the mansion.

INT. TALBOT HALL, GRAND HALL -- NIGHT
Lawrence runs in, distraught, at his wit's end.

LAWRENCE
Father!

He runs halfway up the central stairs to the landing. At

the top of the stairs, Samson comes to BARK down at Lawrence.

LAWRENCE
FATHER! !

CONT INUED
57.

Lawrence's VOICE ECHOES, unanswered. Samson's BARKING.
Lawrence despairs, looking at the CLOTH he still holds...

It is a TORN SHIRT POCKET bearing the unmistakable TALBOT
FAMILY CREST we've seen Sir John wearing many times.

FLASHBACK / EXT. TALBOT HALL -- NIGHT

As seen before, Sir John addresses the THREE HUNTING
PARTIES, on horseback, gathered on the GREAT LAWN.

SIR JOHN
I have a feeling you will learn what
it is to pit yourself against a
worthy adversary tonight.

SLOW 200M IN: on Sir John's SHIRT POCKET where, even partly
obscured by his JACKET, the CREST is easily recognizable.

BACK TO SCENE -- IN THE GRAND HALL

Lawrence closes his fist around the torn pocket, allowing
his shock to be overtaken by rage’ and by determination.
He bounds back down the stairs, striding towards the open
front door, but stops, realizing something.

He turns, looking up... at Samson, still BARKING.
cur TO:
EXT. TALBOT HALL, REAR GARDENS -- MOMENTS LATER -- NIGHT

Lawrence, LANTERN in hand, has Samson on a LEASH, letting”
the dog lead him from the GARDENS to the FOREST; where we
saw Lawrence and Gwen follow Sir John the night before.

ON THE FOREST TRAIL

Lawrence pulls out Sir John's ripped POCKET, giving Samson
a good sniff of it. Samson barks, following the scent into
the foggy FOREST, quickly leading Lawrence.

They pass the eerie Talbot GRAVEYARD.

EXT. CASTLE RUINS -- NIGHT

Samson and Lawrence enter this clearing. The towering
CASTLE RUINS appear menacing in the ghostly mist.

Samson guides Lawrence towards the ruins, heading across an
uneven field of fallen STONES. Samson goes to start BARKING
at a large HOLE in the CASTLE WALL.

Lawrence pulls Samson's leash, dragging him back.
He ties Samson to a downed TREE, pets Samson's head.
58.

INSIDE THE CASTLE RUINS

Lawrence ducks through the HOLE, warily entering a dank,
moss-and-ivy-covered PASSAGEWAY. To the right, there's a
dead end of fallen DEBRIS; to the left, a narrow STAIRWELL.

FOLLOW: Lawrence moving urgently DOWN the twisting and
turning STAIRWELL, leading with his lantern.

IN THE CASTLE CATACOMBS

Lawrence exits the stairs into a TUNNEL PASSAGEWAY with
empty BURIAL CHAMBERS in the walls. He holds his lantern
down to examine FOOTPRINTS on the muddy floor. RATS scurry.

Lawrence runs, ignoring the squealing RATS which flee ahead
and peer from the chambers. He approaches an unlocked,
wrought IRON GATE across the passageway, pushes through.

Lawrence nears the tunnel's end, arriving at...

A massive, WOODEN DOOR, reinforced by a METAL SLATS.

He marvels at the door's SIX formidable LOCKS and huge
CROSSBAR which can be dropped and locked across to keep
whatever in. He grasps the door handle, PULLING...

It takes tremendous effort to swing the door OPEN.

INSIDE THE DOOR

Lawrence enters a large, tomb-like VAULT.

Straight ahead, a METAL CHAIR stands amongst a pile of many
heavy CHAINS and SHACKLES. The CHAINS and even the CHAIR
itself are BOLTED into the STONE WALL behind.

Lawrence approaches. The WALLS and FLOOR around the chair
are COVERED in countless deep SCRATCHES. CLAW MARKS.

Lawrence lifts his lantern, looking up...
More SCRATCHES on the low, stone CEILING.

Lawrence turns, looking to the inside of the DOOR.
It's covered in METAL PLATING which is CLAWED and DENTED.

Lawrence crosses to a far wall, examining...

A SHRINE of sorts in a small ALCOVE. Melted WAX on the
alcove shelf shows where CANDLES have burnt down amongst
wilted FLOWERS under a framed PHOTO bolted into the wall...
A PHOTOGRAPH of the lovely Gypsy woman, CARMILLA.

CcuT TO:
INT. FOREST -- NIGHT i

Lawrence runs full out, PISTOL held, sprinting down the long
forest trail back towards the --

Suddenly, the WEREWOLF LEAPS out from the dark forest with
@ ROAR -- SLAMMING into Lawrence with violent ferocity!

CONTINUED
59.

Lawrence hits the ground, TUMBLING...

The Werewolf ROLLS off, SPRINGING agilely mid-roll...
LANDING crouched, half-hidden in the foliage. 1

Lawrence struggles to recover, in great pain as he clutches
his left arm which BLEEDS PROFUSELY through his CLAWED OPEN
sleeve. He looks up to see...

The Werewolf rises to full height so we finally lay eyes
upon him: truly half-man/half-wolf, bipedal, covered in
dense, dark FUR with much GREY FUR on his face. He wears
Sir John's PANTS and tattered SHIRT. His CLAWED hands,
jowls and heaving chest are matted with fresh BLOOD.

Sir John's features are recognizable in the Werewolf's
frightful visage, especially in the EYES; but there is no
humanity there. The Werewolf is an animal.

The Werewolf lets out a ear-splitting ROAR, fangs bared!

Lawrence looks to his right...
Where his PISTOL lies not far away.

Lawrence dives towards the gun, reaching...
The Werewolf crosses the distance instantly...

SMASHING into Lawrence, CLAWS DIGGING IN; TEETH SINKING into:
Lawrence's shoulder as Lawrence CRIES OUT!

The Werewolf THROWS Lawrence...

-Lawrence lands, stunned, his CLOTHING further SHREDDED, with
deep, BLOODY LACERATIONS beneath.

Lawrence tries to rise, crawling, trying not to black out.
The Werewolf comes to STOMP one clawed foot down on
Lawrence's back, forcing him to the ground!

The Werewolf crouches over Lawrence, HOWLING victoriously,
raising one clawed hand, about to strike the killing blow...
A RIFLE SHOT is HEARD -- a BULLET EXPLODING into a TREE
behind! The Werewolf spins, his attention captured.

ACROSS THE FOREST, Doctor Lloyd walks forward, aiming his
smoking RIFLE, his horse in the fog behind him.

DOCTOR LLOYD
Lawrence!

As the Werewolf starts bounding towards Doctor Lloyd...
Lawrence manages to lift his head, trying to focus.

LAWRENCE
Doctor, no... run...!
60.

LAWRENCE'S POV
The Werewolf's storming across the forest. Doctor Lloyd
FIRES again. As the Werewolf LEAPS to attack Dr. Lloyd
EVERYTHING SPINS as Lawrence is BLACKING OUT...
FADE TO BLACK
We HEAR DR. LLOYD'S SCREAMS. Then, THUNDER RUMBLING...
FADE IN:
FLASHBACK / INT. TALBOT HOUSE, BEDROOM -- NIGHT

LIGHTNING FLASHES. Young Lawrence, 10, sits up in his bed
looking fearfully to the darkness.

INT. TALBOT HOUSE, HALLWAY -- NIGHT

With the STORM HEARD raging outside, Young Lawrence peers
out into the HALLWAY. An ANGUISHED HOWL is HEARD, but it's
lost in the SOUND of THUNDER. Was it imagined?

Young Lawrence starts tentatively down the long, dark hall.
LIGHTNING illuminates many big game, ANIMAL HEAD TROPHIES
mounted one-after-another: TIGER... ELEPHANT... LION...
Young Lawrence walks, trying to ignore the freakish tableau.
DOWN THE HALL

Young Lawrence slows, looking ahead to... a DOOR ajar.
LIQUID pools out from beneath, like black molasses.

Young Lawrence moves to push the DOOR OPEN...
IN THIS MASTER BEDROOM
A DARK SHAPE is hunched over, cradling the FIGURE of a WOMAN.

YOUNG LAWRENCE
Father... ?

The DARK SHAPE turns. LIGHTNING FLASHES across the bloody
face of the WEREWOLF! It's Sir John, fully transformed into
the Werewolf [without any grey fur], ROARING!

The cradled WOMAN'S HEAD falls back limply. It's Lawrence's
MOTHER; her THROAT TORN OUT, BLOOD FLOWING to the floor.

The Werewolf drops her, turning towards Lawrence.

Young Lawrence stumbles back in horror...

Falling back against his brother, Benjamin, 12, arriving in
the doorway. Benjamin, likewise terrified, raises a PISTOL
to the room -- FIRES a BOOMING SHOT!

CONTINUED

 
61.

The Werewolf's HIT in the side, thrown back, YELPING!

As Benjamin adjusts his aim through the doorway...
The Werewolf's already FLYING across the darkness --
SMASHING through a WINDOW -- gone into the STORMY NIGHT!

WE LOOK STRAIGHT DOWN: upon Benjamin and Lawrence's MOTHER
lying in a POOL of BLOOD as the ROOM begins SPIRALING...

FADE TO BLACK

MAN'S VOICE (0.S.)
Mister Talbot? Wake up, sir...

CLOSE ON:

WATER is THROWN in Lawrence's face, causing him to GASP
AWAKE. He's groggy, disoriented.

MAN'S VOICE (0.S.)
Afternoon, Mister Talbot. We'll have
you awake finally, if you please.

Angry SHOUTS and EXALTATIONS ECHO from elsewhere.
As Lawrence tries to regain his senses, we REVEAL...

INT. CELL, INSANE ASYLUM -- NIGHT

Lawrence is in a small, filthy ASYLUM CELL, seated in a
WOODEN WHEELCHAIR. He's shirtless, with all the bruised,
raw, werewolf-inflicted WOUNDS across his ARMS, SHOULDERS
and CHEST sewn up in heavy twine STITCHES. Lawrence panics.

LAWRENCE
What... what is this...?

He struggles, his ARMS and LEGS BOUND to the chair.
Bearded, bespectacled DOCTOR HENDRICK, in a dirty LAB COAT
watches. A CREEPY GUARD stands holding the WATER BUCKET.

LAWRENCE
What the hell is this!?

DOCTOR HENDRICK
Calm yourself, Mister Talbot, or I'll
be forced to put you back under.

Lawrence realizes he's unable to break free, helpless.

DOCTOR HENDRICK
My name is Doctor Hendrick. You've
been committed to The Lambeth Asylum, |
London. Not your first visit with t
us, apparently.

CONTINUED i
62.

LAWRENCE
No. That's... that's not possible...
This isn't happening!

DOCTOR HENDRICK
Let's please try not to upset
ourselves. You are here for your own
good, after all.
(to CREEPY GUARD)
Bring him.

IN THE ASYLUM CORRIDOR

Creepy Guard pushes Lawrence in the squeaky wheelchair as
Doctor Hendrick walks alongside. They pass other INMATES'
CELLS. Lawrence is in a state of numb, horrified disbelief.

DOCTOR HENDRICK
You tried to kill yourself. Your
father brought you to us. You are
gravely injured, not just physically,
but mentally as well. We've had to
keep you heavily sedated, lest you
tear loose your stitches again.

LAWRENCE
How long have I been here?

DOCTOR HENDRICK
A fortnight now. Spent ranting.
Raving. You are severely delusional.

Lawrence glimpses INMATES in their cells: filthy, half-naked
MEN, CRYING, spouting GIBBERISH and/or gesticulating wildly.

DOCTOR HENDRICK
Your father is a werewolf, you say.
You believe your wounds were not self-
inflicted, but caused when he
attacked you in his... animalistic
state. You also claim your father
murdered your mother. Do you
remember any of this?

LAWRENCE
(grimly)
I remember. I remember everything.
INT. LAMBETH ASYLUM, HENDRICK'S OFFICE -- NIGHT
Lawrence is wheeled in. Sir John stands looking up at
yellowed CHARTS of HUMAN ANATOMY which cover the walls of
this cluttered, disorganized OFFICE.
Lawrence strains in angry frustration against his bindings.

CONT INUED
63.

DOCTOR HENDRICK
Sir John.

SIR JOHN
Doctor. Would it be possible for me
to visit privately with my son?

DOCTOR HENDRICK
I suppose, so long as you're careful.

CREEPY GUARD
I'll be right outside in the hallway,
Sir, if he should become agitated.

Hendrick and Creepy Guard go. Sir John looks to Lawrence.

SIR JOHN
I tried warn you. I told you not to
join the hunt.

LAWRENCE
Where's Gwen?

SIR JOHN
Gone. Probably somewhere here in
London. What does it matter?

LAWRENCE
Doctor Lloyd?

SIR JOHN
Killed. Saving you, it seems. Dead
along with Strickland and Colonel
Montford.

LAWRENCE
You killed them.

SIR JOHN
Apparently. Though, only you and I
know that. To everyone else, we and
some peasants were the few survivors.

LAWRENCE
You... you killed mother.

This troubles Sir John. He nods, solemnly remembering.

SIR JOHN
Yes. Yes. So long ago...
(pause)

It's like a vague memory of a
nightmare. A nightmare that began on
a fateful African expedition. Kenya,
1863. Where the hunter became the
hunted. What manner of creature
attacked me, I did not know...
64.

FLASHBACK / EXT. AFRICAN PLAIN -- NIGHT

By FULL MOON light, with his CAMP in the distance, Younger
Sir John, RIFLE up, stalks through waist-deep GRASSLANDS.

A huge WEREWOLF SPRINGS up from the bush
Sir John wheels, FIRING! -- too late as the fearsome,
WEREWOLF is already upon him, SCREECHING!

 

 

BACK TO SCENE -- ASYLUM OFFICE

SIR JOHN
I barely fought the thing off, but
not before I was bitten. So when I
returned to Blackmoor and my family,
to recover from my wounds... I had no
idea a demon slumbered inside me. In
my very blood.

FLASHBACK / EXT. TALBOT HALL, MASTER BEDROOM -- NIGHT

The bloody-faced WEREWOLF that Sir John has become drops
MOTHER'S BODY, turning towards Young Lawrence in the doorway.

BACK TO SCENE -- ASYLUM OFFICE
Sir John is truly remorseful.

SIR JOHN

At the time, I was fully prepared to
take my own life. How could I not,
after what I had done? Except... it
was not me.

(looks to Lawrence)
When the transformation comes, I
cease to exist. I have no control
over the beast... nor recollection of
its actions, afterwards. I was as
much a witness to the tragedy of your
mother's death as you were.

LAWRENCE
Is that what you tell yourself?
SIR JOHN
Believe what you want. I mourn her

every day.
(looking around) i
As for this place... I brought you
here then, to heal your broken mind.
It's where you built what memory of i
her death your sanity could accept. |
(pause)
Meanwhile, I persuaded your brother
to aid me. So that before the next |
full moon... I

a prison that could, contain the
werewolf.

FLASHBACK / INT. CASTLE RUINS, VAULT -- NIGHT

Younger Sir John, shirtless, is seated in the METAL CHAIR we
saw earlier. He's SHACKLED and CHAINED, sweating, waiting

BACK TO SCENE -- ASYLUM OFFICE |

SIR JOHN
Every month since, I have imprisoned
myself.

FLASHBACK / INT. CASTLE RUINS, VAULT -~ NIGHT

Young Sir John is CHAINED down, in MID-TRANSFORMATION!
He's SCREAMING in pain, FUR GROWING across his quaking body
as he struggles to break free of the tangle of CHAINS!

BACK TO SCENE -- ASYLUM OFFICE

SIR JOHN
Once each month at least, and twice
in those months, we soon discovered,
when a second moon on the cusp of the
wax or wane is whole enough to
overtake me.

LAWRENCE
Ben knew, all this time.

SIR JOHN
Benjamin had always been the one
person in my life who remained
steadfast by my side. Together, we
were able to carve out a life for me,
despite my incurable affliction. We
kept my bestial alter-ego at bay.

LAWRENCE
Until now. Until Carmilla.

Sir John looks to Lawrence.

LAWRENCE
I saw the vault in the castle ruins.
I saw the shrine you made to her. it
was never Benjamin who had the affair
with the Gypsy woman. It was you.

SIR JOHN
Yes.

CONTINUED
LAWRENCE
Ben was not himself once Carmilla was
jailed, because he knew that you were
the adulterer. That's why he had
been seen arguing with her... why he
visited her. He knew Carmilla
carried your child.

SIR JOHN
And look what the Philistines did to
her. Her vile husband beat her
bloody before bringing her to
Strickland, and yet she was the one
jailed. And for what Crime? Love.
For love! For that selfsame failing,
I was expected to be brought forth
and pilloried. Made a pariah! For
daring to know love yet one last time
in my life!

LAWRENCE
Except you let this happen when you
refused to come forward.

SIR JOHN
Untrue! I did everything I could to
free Carmilla...

LAWRENCE
Everything but accept responsibility!

SIR JOHN

If I came forward, they never would
have let it end! She gave them a
name, as I told her to. The next
night would have passed without
incident. I would have made certain
of that. She should have been
released to leave with her tribe! I
was willing to lose her, if that's
what it took. Against every emotion
in my heart, I would've watched her
walk out of my life, even carrying my
own child! So long she was free!

(fury growing)
You saw. You saw how the good
villagers of Blackmoor held their
tongues while Strickland paraded
Carmilla before them! After so many
years of my protecting every man,
woman and child from the abomination
inside me! To what end? So I should
have to watch as their persecutions
drove her to her death...!?

LAWRENCE
You've...you've gone mad...

SIR JOHN
To hell with each and every one of
them. Let them mount whatever

defense they can manage... till
either Blackmoor is dead... or I am.
LAWRENCE
Can't you see that it's driven you
mad!
SIR JOHN

You may be right. Absolutely. But,
what concern is it of yours anymore?
You've been bitten. You must know
what that means.

Lawrence does know, desolate, straining in his bindings.

SIR JOHN
It would have been God's mercy if you
weren't discovered alive, but you
were. You survived.
(long pause)
There's only one gesture of kindness
I can show you now.

Sir John produces a STRAIGHT RAZOR, shows its blade.
SIR JOHN

Keep it hidden. Till a time comes
when you are alone and can use it.

Sir John comes to place the closed RAZOR in Lawrence's bound

hand, so Lawrence can palm it.

SIR JOHN
Farewell, son. Farewell.

Sir John walks towards the door. Lawrence is demoralized,
but takes a deep breath, mustering one last defiance.

LAWRENCE
Before you go, I want you to know...
I know now that you killed Ben.

Sir John stops, keeping his back to Lawrence.

LAWRENCE
He never would have helped you
unleash the werewolf. He would have
fought you. And so you killed him,
that very first night, didn't you?

SIR JOHN
I couldn't have, could I? Since he
went missing the day after.

CONT INUED
68.

LAWRENCE
No. When Gwen said he was still at
Talbot Hall after the first murder,
she was trusting in what you told
everyone. But, she was in London.
Ben had sent her away. Because he
knew what you were about to do!

Sir John still faces away, betraying nothing.

SIR JOHN
Benjamin left. He's deserted me,
just as you deserted me before him...

LAWRENCE
You probably didn't even know till
you found him in the morning, isn't
that so...?!
(venting fury)
And where did you hide the body?!
Where did you bury my brother?!!

The DOOR SLAMS OPEN as Creepy Guard and Dr. Hendrick enter.
LAWRENCE
He gave his whole life to you; your
loving, loyal son... and you murdered
him! YOU MURDERED HIM!!

Creepy Guard comes to grab Lawrence in a headlock.

Dr. Hendrick stabs a HYPODERMIC NEEDLE into Lawrence's neck

Lawrence's hand SPASMS...
Dropping the RAZOR to the floor.

Dr. Hendrick pushes the hypo's plunger. As Lawrence CRIES
OUT, we ZOOM IN: entering HIS PUPIL -- into PITCH BLACK...

NIGHTMARE MONTAGE BEGINS / INT. THEATER -- NIGHT

From BLACKNESS: a gaslight LAMP FLICKERS to life, back-—
lighting a stage-craft FULL MOON within a familiar,
painted STAGE BACKDROP of crooked trees and grim sky.
Lawrence steps INTO FRAME, wearing a STRAITJACKET.

LAWRENCE
To be or not to be. That is the
question! Whether 'tis...

He overacts, trying to be HEARD over growing O.S. GROWLING.

LAWRENCE
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to
suffer!! The slings and arrows of

outrageous fortune!

CONTINUED
Shouting over the still GROWING SOUND of monstrous SNARLING
and GNASHING, Lawrence looks out to see...

He stands before an S.R.O. AUDIENCE made up entirely of all
manner of MALE and FEMALE WEREWOLVES in FANCY DRESS; all of
them ravenously consuming dismembered HUMAN REMAINS.

The WEREWOLVES tear into severed ARMS and LEGS, some
fighting over bloody ENTRAILS, while down the CENTER AISLE
walks the transformed SIR JOHN; fully a WEREWOLF, in a fine
SUIT, smoking a CIGAR and CLAPPING his clawed hands.

SIR JOHN WEREWOLF
Bravo! Bravo! My son, ladies and
gentlemen! My son!

The stage's RED CURTAIN FALLS CLOSED behind Lawrence as he
backs fearfully away, slipping through the center slit...
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CURTAIN: Lawrence finds himself...

ON THE MOORS

IN A DENSE FOG. Lawrence walks, leaving the curtain behind.

OLD MALEVA'S VOICE (0.S.)
Even a man who is pure in heart and
says his prayers by night...

There's a huge SHAPE slowly approaching in the FOG.
OLD MALEVA'S VOICE (0.8.)
++. May become a wolf when the
wolfsbane blooms... and the autumn
moon is bright.

Old Maleva arrives on horseback, in full GYPSY REGALIA.

LAWRENCE
Why are you here?

OLD MALEVA
I pledged to seek you out, Lawrence
Talbot... if the spirits gave an

answer to your question. From across

the beyond, the answer came...

Benjamin is with your mother now.

My mother?

OLD MALEVA

WHITE WALLS are covered in old blood and worse. Lawrence
sleeps, in his STRAITJACKET, curled fetal, DREAMING...

LAWRENCE'S DREAM -- WEREWOLF'S POV

We're RUNNING quickly through misty, gnarled FOREST...

IN THE CELL

Lawrence rolls, twitching. Areas of FUR are beginning to
crop up on his face. His VEINS THROB. His grinding TEETH
are becoming SHARP FANGS. He's partially transformed!
LAWRENCE'S DREAM -- WEREWOLF'S POV

RUNNING fast, from FOREST to the open MOORS...

IN THE CELL

Lawrence rolls back the other way, now returned to NORMAL.
He continues stirring, feverish.

LAWRENCE'S DREAM -- WEREWOLF'S POV

RUNNING across the GREAT LAWN, to TALBOT HOUSE, where every
WINDOW is filled with a bright, HELLISH RED GLOW.

DISSOLVE TO:

IN_A WATER TANK

Lawrence PLUNGES UPSIDE DOWN into a GLASS TANK of MURKY
WATER! His eyes open, bulging, as he awakens, mortified.
He's in up to his waist, straitjacketed.

Lawrence squirms, left under for an interminably long time.
As he YELLS, spewing BUBBLES, he's suddenly YANKED UPWARD...

IN AN ASYLUM TREATMENT ROOM

Creepy Guard turns the WHEEL of a CHAIN and PULLEY SYSTEM
which hoists Lawrence, by his CHAINED feet, up from the
Hydro-Therapy TANK. Lawrence hangs, GASPING.

LAWRENCE'S UPSIDE-DOWN POV: reveals other INMATES in BIZARRE
CONTRAPTIONS; One naked LUNATIC is strapped to a TABLE, with
INCISIONS on his body BLEEDING into GROOVES in the tabletop;
another INMATE, in a LEATHER COLLAR at the end of a POLE
held by a DOCTOR, is forced to walk a crude TREADMILL.

Lawrence ends up face-to-upside-down-face with Dr. Hendrick.

DOCTOR HENDRICK
(to Creepy Guard)
Again.

Lawrence barely has time to react as Creepy Guard kicks the
release on the PULLEY-SYSTEM'S WHEEL, dropping Lawrence...

IN THE WATER TANK

Lawrence SPLASHES under! He twists, desperately afraid.
More endless seconds tick by, till he simply can't hold his
breath any more. He's BLACKING OUT, his eyes rolling back.

DISSOLVE TO:
LAWRENCE'S DREAM -- LAWRENCE'S POV

We WALK down the familiar UPSTAIRS HALLWAY of the TALBOT
MANSION. Where once were the big game, animal head
TROPHIES, now hang stuffed and mounted HUMAN HEADS...

The discolored, gory HEADS of FITZGERALD... CONSTABLE NYE...
STRICKLAND... DOCTOR LLOYD... COLONEL MONTFORD; each ,with
their NAME engraved on.a BRASS PLAQUE beneath.

FURTHER ON, we approach the MASTER BEDROOM DOOR, HEARING a
WOMAN'S CRIES. The door OPENS by itself...

IN THE MASTER BEDROOM
By OIL LAMP LIGHT, a WEREWOLF attacks a WOMAN on the BED.

It's Gwen on the bed, struggling, SCREAMING. The WEREWOLF
is on top of her, TEARING at her clothing. Gwen pounds on
the creature's chest, trying to fight him off, in tears.

GWEN
No... no... Lawrence, no!

The Werewolf abruptly reacts, stopping. We can see it now,
in his EYES -- it is Lawrence. The Werewolf turns, seeing
himself in a huge, ornate MIRROR across the room...

IN THE MIRROR: it's human LAWRENCE reflected, sweaty, having
forced himself onto Gwen who lies under him, weeping.
Reflected-Lawrence grabs the LAMP, enraged, THROWING it --
SHATTERING the mirror as the LAMP EXPLODES into FLAMES!

 

END MONTAGE/DISSOLVE TO:
INT. ASYLUM, PADDED CELL -- NIGHT

Lawrence lifts his bedraggled head, regaining consciousness.

He is once again BOUND to his WHEELCHAIR. He's barefoot,
dressed in an institutional SHIRT and PANTS.
Hendrick stands flanked by Creepy Guard.

DOCTOR HENDRICK
Good evening, Mister Talbot. Against
my better judgement, I've decided to
allow a visitation. I hope it may
have a calming influence.

Lawrence is groggily trying to shake out the cobwebs.

DOCTOR HENDRICK
You'll only have a moment.

A young, pasty-faced INTERN escorts Gwen in, waits by the

door. Gwen looks at Lawrence, hand to her mouth, anguished.

GWEN
Lawrence.

LAWRENCE
Gwen? Is it truly you?

GWEN
Oh, Lawrence... I've been trying for
weeks to be allowed to see you. Are
you alright? What have they done?
(to Dr. Hendrick)
Why is he tied down like this?!

DOCTOR HENDRICK
For his own safety, Miss.

LAWRENCE
It's alright, Gwen. You're...you're
with your family? Here in the city?

GWEN
Yes. We're doing everything we can.
Your father... he brought you without

telling anyone. You were hurt,
nearly killed. He took you from
Talbot Hall in the middle of the
night.

I... I thought I might never find you
again...

Gwen reaches to touch Lawrence's face.

DOCTOR HENDRICK
No physical contact with the patient
if you please, Miss.

I... I can't tell if you're a dream
or if I'm awake. I'm sorry.

Tears roll down Lawrence's cheeks.

GWEN
We're going to get you out of here
somehow. We'll do whatever it takes.
We'll go to doctors, solicitors...

LAWRENCE
No. It's too late. It's too late
for me now.

GWEN
What...what are you talking about?
What happened? What happened that
night?

DOCTOR HENDRICK
That's enough, Miss Conliffe. I can
see this was a mistake...

Doctor Hendrick nods and Pasty Intern steps forward.

LAWRENCE
Listen to me, Gwen. Promise me. ,
Don't ever go back there...

Pasty Intern begins pulling Gwen away. She's distraught.

LAWRENCE :
Don't go back to Blackmoor, whatever

Let go of me! No! Lawrence!

Gwen's looking back as she's pulled away. Gone.
Lawrence despairs. Doctor Hendrick's angry.

74,

Doctor Hendrick stands. TWO other DOCTORS sit in the front
row.

DOCTOR HENDRICK
(to Lawrence)
My associates and I... we've been
quite eager for this night to arrive.
We consider you a particularly
fascinating case.

LAWRENCE
(bitterly)
I'm flattered.

Creepy Guard walks back to the only door while sorting
through the MANY KEYS on his KEYCHAIN. He LOCKS the door.

DOCTOR HENDRICK
What you're suffering from is called

"Lycanthropy." Simply put, it's the
belief that you will be transformed
into a wolf... that you will take on

certain physical characteristics of
the wolf. There are legends of
werewolfism as far back as Greek
mythology, and beyond. Across almost
every culture, you will find some
version of the "changling" delusion.

Dr. Hendrick paces. Creepy Guard returns to observe.

DOCTOR HENDRICK

There were ancient, primal tribes
whose warriors believed that
consuming the flesh of those they
defeated would grant them their
enemies strengths. The Norse
Berserkers would adorn themselves in
animal hides before each battle. In
the Medieval Ages, throughout Europe,
thousands of persons, even tens of
thousands, were put to death as
convicted werewolves.

(pause)
We live in a more enlightened age.

(to 2ND DOCTOR)
Doctor, if you wouldn't mind...

2nd Doctor rises, crossing to a tall WINDOW.

DOCTOR HENDRICK
We are here tonight, to illustrate
conclusively that your fears are
guite irrational.

2nd Doctor pulls aside the CURTAINS, revealing a view of the
NIGHT SKY and the high FULL MOON shining brightly.

CONT INUED
Realization strikes Lawrence like a thunderbolt.

LAWRENCE
What...what are you doing...?

DOCTOR HENDRICK
We are simply going to remain in this
room together, all night. And once
you've witnessed that the full moon
holds no sway over you; that you
remain a perfectly ordinary human
being...

LAWRENCE
my God...

DOCTOR HENDRICK
You will have taken your first small
step down the long road to recovery.

LAWRENCE
You can't do this... you can't!

DOCTOR HENDRICK
Lycanthropy is a disease of the mind
existing somewhere in the deep
recesses of your thoughts. Yes, to
you, it seems very real!

LAWRENCE
It is real! You've got to believe me!

. DOCTOR HENDRICK
You've suffered quite traumatic
personal experiences, Mister Talbot,
we're well aware. You hate your
father. Your mother committed
suicide. Therefore, your father must
be to blame for her death...

Lawrence is fed up, begins struggling violently, trying

pull his arms and legs free of the wheelchair!

DOCTOR HENDRICK
You witnessed your mother's self
mutilation! Your young mind, unable
to accept it, created a fantastical
truth; that your father is literally
a monster!

Lawrence is unable to free himself, SWEATING, BREATHING HARD.

DOCTOR HENDRICK
But, your father is not a werewolf.
You were not bitten by a werewolf.

You will not become a werewolf

Across the FOGGY CITY, at the HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT, majestic
BIG BEN shows 12:00. The CLOCKTOWER TOLLS... TOLLS...

INT. OPERATING THEATER -- NIGHT

Dr. Hendrick sits beside the other doctors. (BIG BEN can be
HEARD faintly TOLLING MIDNIGHT in the B.G.)

DOCTOR HENDRICK
Tonight, we will sit and watch the
evening passing uneventfully.

LAWRENCE
Tonight you will sit and watch me
become a werewolf, and then I will
kill you all! Please, listen...
sedate me! Lock me up! Kill me!

Lawrence looks down to see...
VEINS on the back of his hands THROB; tiny HAIRS GROW!

LAWRENCE
Do something, anything, I'm begging
you! You have to --

Lawrence doubles over, suddenly in excruciating pain!
He jerks back in the wheel chair CRYING OUT!

LAWRENCE
It's... HAPPENING...!

Doctor Hendrick and the other doctors watch, unimpressed.
DOCTOR HENDRICK
It's your imagination, Mister Talbot.
All in your vivid imagination!
Lawrence CRIES OUT, hyperventilating, TREMBLING...

LAWRENCE
GET! OUT!

And the old-school TRANSFORMATION begins...
Lawrence's hands clench as heavy FUR begins to SPROUT,
impossibly quickly! His FINGERTIPS split, GROWING CLAWS!

Lawrence's FEET endure a similar transformation, flesh
rippling, thick FUR SPROUTING as if by magic! CLAWS GROW!

Dr. Hendrick and associates watch in stupefied terror.

Lawrence throws his head back, SCREAMING! FUR'S GROWING out
from his face and jowls while his TEETH become sharp FANGS!

Creepy Guard's slack-jawed, backing to the door.
Lawrence's FACE MUTATES into the lurid, monstrously lupine
face of THE WOLFMAN; his long SCREAM becoming the raging,
guttural ROAR of the Wolfman!

DOCTOR HENDRICK
Bloody Hell!
Dr. Hendrick, 2nd Doctor and 3rd Doctor make a mad scramble
for the door, where... Creepy Guard's already beginning a
desperate search through his overburdened KEYCHAIN.

The transmutation now complete, the Wolfman struggles
against the STRAPS holding him to the wheelchair!

AT THE LOCKED DOOR, Creepy Guard's frantically trying to

find the KEY! The three doctors are BANGING on the door,
YELLING, trying to pull it open! Dr. Hendrick wrests the
KEYCHAIN from Creepy Guard's grasp.

DOCTOR HENDRICK
Give me those keys, you imbecile!

The Wolfman YANKS his arms and legs free, rising.

2nd Doctor sees this, looks up, across the room...
There's a LADDER built into the wall, leading to a SKYLIGHT.

2nd Doctor runs towards the ladder.
Wolfman reacts, enraged, THROWING the WHEELCHAIR...

The WHEELCHAIR SMASHES 2nd Doctor against the wall!
He slumps, trailing a wide SMEAR of BLOOD.

Wolfman ROARS, heading for the others.

Hendrick tries one KEY in the door's lock... doesn't work
Creepy Guard sees the Wolfman coming.

3RD DOCTOR
Hurry, Hendrick, hurry! :

Creepy Guard gathers his nerve, turning to face the Wolfman,
reaching to take his heavy TRUNCHEON from his belt. With a
YELL of bravado, Creepy Guard charges, the club raised...

The Wolfman greets him with a swift and bloodying BACKHANDED
SWIPE -- sends Creepy Guard CARTWHEELING...

 

Creepy Guard TOPPLES the OPERATING TABLE!
CONTINUED :

Wolfman LEAPS across the distance...
Lands on Creepy Guard to begin TEARING HIM APART!

AT THE DOOR, Dr. Hendrick inserts another KEY...

DOCTOR HENDRICK
Got it!

As he turns the KEY, it SNAPS OFF in the LOCK.

DOCTOR HENDRICK
Oh boy.

By the OPERATING TABLE (which blocks our view of most of the
gory carnage), the Wolfman straightens, BLOOD-SOAKED, having
finished with Creepy Guard.
Dr. Hendrick begins POUNDING the door's small, circular
WINDOW. 3rd Doctor looks around, frantic, sees...
The Wolfman stalking towards them.
IN THE HALLWAY
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR: Dr. Hendrick's BLOODIED FIST
BREAKS the WINDOW! Hendrick presses his face against the
small HOLE, jagged glass cutting his fingers.
DOCTOR HENDRICK

Help! Open this door! Oh, Lord,

someone please open this --
Doctor Hendrick is violently PULLED AWAY.
EXT. LAMBETH ASYLUM -~ AN INSTANT LATER
The FULL MOON is REFLECTED in ONE of the tall WINDOWS high
on the red brick exterior of Lambeth Asylum, and then...
The WINDOW SPLINTERS as Dr. Hendrick is THROWN OUT!
Followed immediately by the Wolfman LEAPING OUT!
IN MID-AIR

Dr. Hendrick WAILS as he FALLS headlong for SIX STORIES,
flailing. Behind, the Wolfman FALLS lithely.

Dr. Hendrick SPLATTERS onto the THAMES' RIVERBANK with the
most disturbing sound of finality. The Wolfman's more
favorable trajectory carries him... SPLASHING into the RIVER!

INT. LONDON SEWERS -- NIGHT

In this long, dark, underground TUNNELWAY, with SLUDGY WATER
FLOWING swiftly through, a MAN'S HEARD WHISTLING. A lanky
RAGPICKER, in tattered SUIT and CAP, makes his way down the
tunnel, carrying a 7-foot-long, WOODEN POLE and a LANTERN.

 

He's wading in the putrid water, using his pole to poke at
the GARBAGE floating and.accumulated on the narrow, rat-
infested WALKWAYS to either side of him.

RAGPICKER
(SINGING)
The man in the moon came down too
soon and asked his way to Norwich!
He went by the south and burnt his
mouth with eating cold plum porridge!

Ragpicker pulls up a GLOVE, examines then discards it.

RAGPICKER
(SINGING)
"Oh... will you walk into my parlor?"
Said the Spider to the fly, "It is
the prettiest parlor that you ever
did spy!"

He brings up a soaking BOOT with his stick. It's worth
taking, so he shoves it in the SACK slung over his shoulder.

RAGPICKER
"You've only got to pop your head
inside of the door, and you'll see
many curious things you never saw
before, Will you, will you walk in,
pretty Fly?"

From behind him, the Wolfman's HOWL ECHOES, distant.
It gives Ragpicker pause: He waits, then continues, leery.

RAGPICKER
"My fine house is always open," said
the Spider to the Fly, "I'm glad to
have the company of all who go by..."

The Wolfman's HOWL is HEARD, very NEAR.
Ragpicker spins to look back, aiming his lantern.

RAGPICKER
(quietly, afraid) |
"Will you... will you walk in, pretty !

Fly...? Will you grant me one sweet
kiss, dear," says the Spider to the :
Fly." |

DOWN THE TUNNEL: coming slowly into view... is the LIGHT of
the LANTERN reflected in the Wolfman's TWO RED EYES.

Ragpicker turns, FLEEING down the tunnel...
FOLLOW: as he's SPLASHING through the muck, TURNING this way
and that... navigating the MAZE of TUNNELS, not looking back.

FURTHER ON

Ragpicker stumbles from one TUNNEL, entering into a main
artery INTERSECTION. WATER'S POURING in from everywhere.

RAGPICKER
(uncertain)
Which way... which way...?!

The RATS scurrying along the walkways are choosing the
largest tunnel; moving the same direction as the WATER'S
INCREASED FLOW. Ragpicker follows their lead.

DOWN THE TUNNEL

Ragpicker sloshes along, FALLING in the RUSH of WATER,
regaining his footing, keeping his lantern aloft.
He halts, crestfallen, shining the lantern ahead...

RAGPICKER
Lordie.

All the rats are disappearing through HOLES in
the tunnel's aged brickwork, while beyond that...

The TUNNEL itself ends at an OUTLET which is criss~-crossed
by a latticework of METAL BARS, so that while the WATER'S
RUSHING out, for Ragpicker it's a DEAD END.

Ragpicker aims his lantern back up the tunnel, against the
current. Before long, the RED EYED Wolfman can be seen
creeping into the LIGHT, SNARLING lowly. As Ragpicker backs
away, we PULL BACK: through the METAL BARS to...
OUTSIDE THE TUNNEL

At the SEWER'S OUTLET, we HEAR only the RUSH of the WATER
CASCADING OUT into the THAMES along with the SOUNDS of the
CITY as the murky WATER begins FLOWING RED with BLOOD.

EXT. THAMES RIVER BANK -~- NIGHT
EEE EEE SANK, ~~ NIGHT
TWO uniformed CONSTABLES patrol a WALKWAY along the Thames.
Across the RIVER, massive SMOKESTACKS disgorge black clouds
to the sky. 1st Constable carries a LANTERN, noticing...

1ST CONSTABLE
Hold on. What's this here...?

He points out a WET AREA of RAILING and WALKWAY where it
looks like someone's climbed out from the river.

81.

Both constables follow the TRAIL of splashed WATER across
the walkway to where lst Constable kneels, indicating...

Wet, clearly inhuman, CLAWED FOOTPRINTS left by the Wolfman.

The constables share a look of bewilderment. They follow
the WET FOOTPRINTS to STAIRS leading up a WOODED HILLSIDE.

EXT. PUBLIC PARK -- MOMENTS LATER

At the top of the STAIRWAY, lst and 2nd Constable arrive,
surveying the surrounding PARK. They walk, seeing...
SOMETHING'S out there in the open space of the LAWN.

Still advancing, 2nd Constable takes his BILLY CLUB from his
belt while 1st Constable puts his WHISTLE to his lips.

IN THE LANTERN LIGHT: the Wolfman's on his haunches,
crouched forward. He turns, clutching a dripping fistful of
ORGANS he's pulled from the pried-open CHEST CAVITY of a
MALE CORPSE, letting out a ROAR from his blood-dripping maw!

2ND CONSTABLE
What in God's creation...?!

The Wolfman rises, moving towards the stupefied constables.
lst Constable starts BLOWING his WHISTLE!

The Wolfman reacts immediately, throwing his hands to his
ears. He retreats from the HIGH PITCH WHISTLING.

ACROSS THE PARK

The Wolfman runs with a fast, loping gait...
Headed for a WOODED AREA ahead with BRIGHT LIGHTS beyond.

1st and 2nd Constable chase, BLOWING their WHISTLES.
EXT. WEST END STREET -- MOMENTS LATER

Residential. Well-dressed PEDESTRIANS, mostly GENTLEMEN
escorting their LADIES, are on the SIDEWALKS. Begging
URCHIN CHILDREN wheedle. COACHES cross. A large, multi-
passenger OMNIBUS is pulled by a TEAM of HORSES.

From the bordering PARK, the Wolfman LEAPS from the TREELINE
into the street, recoiling in confusion at all the GAS LAMP
LIGHT and ACTIVITY. PEDESTRIANS react. WOMEN SCREAM.

The Wolfman runs directly into the path of the OMNIBUS...
The horses REAR up, spooked, SCREECHING!

The Wolfman flees onward across the street.
The horses BOLT, charging forward, picking up speed!

ON THE OMNIBUS

The omnibus DRIVER pulls on the reins, to no avail.
The horses are OUT OF CONTROL, heading for the SIDEWALK... i

ON THE SIDEWALK

As EVERYONE'S fleeing all directions...
A wealthy MAN and WOMAN are brutally RUN DOWN!

ON THE STREET

The omnibus' horses veer back towards the street, but
they're turning too sharply -- THROWING the DRIVER from his
perch as the OMNIBUS is TIPPING...

IN THE OMNIBUS

A DOZEN PASSENGERS all CRY OUT as the OMNIBUS OVERTURNS!
EVERYONE'S THROWN! BREAKING WINDOWS rain GLASS SHARDS!

ON THE STREET

More panicked PEDESTRIANS scatter as...
The Wolfman charges straight at one BUILDING, LEAPING...

The Wolfman grabs onto the the building's BRICKFACE and
begins swiftly scaling the FACADE and WINDOW LEDGES. He's .
astonishingly agile, using his clawed HANDS and FEET to make
quick work of the THREE STORIES.

ON THE ROOFTOP

The Wolfman pulls himself up, traversing the ROOFTOP 'S EDGE
at an effortlessly-balanced sprint, JUMPING...

...landing on all
fours on the neighboring, PITCHED ROOF. He quickly climbs
that roof to it's peak, moving fleet-footedly along the
narrow peak till he once again JUMPS...

..-.TRAVELING an impossible distance...

...to the next ROOFTOP, fleeing on without hesitation or mis-
step. And so it goes as he LEAPS from BUILDING...

...to BUILDING,
with unerring animal physicality and instinct, against the
backdrop of the great, sprawling, London METROPOLIS.

OTHER surrounding COUPLES stand watching, sipping CHAMPAGNE.
EVERYONE is in elaborate COSTUME, musicians included; all
wear fanciful ANIMAL MASKS.

At long BANQUET TABLES at one end of the room, SERVANTS

clear dishes left from a feast. Some COUPLES still linger
at the tables, conversing. It's at the giant WINDOWS over
the dining tables where -- the Wolfman comes CRASHING IN...

The Wolfman lands in the middle of the dancing revellers,
grabbing one BIRD-MASKED MAN from behind and reaching around
with one hand to CLAW OPEN THE MAN'S THROAT!

BLOOD FOUNTAINS up as the ROARING Wolfman drops the victim.

The Wolfman starts cutting a bloody swatch of carnage —-
ATTACKING ANYONE and EVERYONE within his grasp!

It's pandemonium! EVERYONE SCREAMING! MUSIC STOPS
disharmoniously. MEN try to protect WOMEN, but...

The Wolfman SLASHES at MEN and WOMEN alike with his razor-
sharp CLAWS -- RIPPING, GOUGING and MAULING -- cutting
people up, BLOOD SPRAYING!

The Wolfman spins, SWIPING at one WOMAN, gutting her...
She drops to her knees, her INTESTINES SLOSHING to the floor.

EVERYONE'S FLEEING away from the center, but...
PEOPLE are falling, getting TRAMPLED!

THREE BRAVE COSTUMED MEN .rush forward...

A BULL-MASKED MAN attacks the Wolfman, taking a wild swing,
but the Wolfman grips the man's arm while BITING savagely
near the shoulder -- TEARING THE MAN'S ARM OFF!

The Wolfman discards the man and the arm as a TIGER-MASKED
MAN charges! The Wolfman TOSSES this man far...

Tiger-Masked Man lands grotesquely in a twisted heap!

A GORILLA-MASKED MAN jumps on the Wolfman from behind, but
the Wolfman immediately THROWS HIM OFF!

The man's trying to crawl away, but The Wolfman's on him,
SINKING HIS FANGS INTO THE BACK OF GORILLA-MASKED MAN'S
HEAD! We can just HEAR the SKULL CRACKING over the man's
CRIES as BLOOD POURS out of the MASK'S MOUTH and EYES!

The bloody Wolfman rises, spinning to look for who's next.
An OWL-MASKED MAN SHOVES past others to THROW one of the OIL i
LAMPS taken from the banquet tables... |

OWL-MASKED MAN i
Look out!

The LAMP SMASHES in front of the Wolfman, FLAMES SPREADING!
The Wolfman's freaked out, backing away.

Another LANTERN is HURTLED...
It EXPLODES onto the floor! The Wolfman voices his fury,
holding up his arms against the FLAMES!

The Wolfman retreats...

Everyone scatters from his path as he VAULTS over the
BANQUET TABLES and begins pulling himself up the cascading
CURTAINS of the shattered WINDOWS.

High above, the Wolfman clings to the curtains, KICKS OFF

 

from the wall -- SWINGING out above the crimson-stained
aftermath below -- HURTLING HIMSELF out into the night!
cur TO:

EXT. LONDON STREET, EAST END -- NIGHT

On a sparsely peopled STREET in a poor section, a few
DRUNKARDS congregate outside a TAVERN. Wild DOGS wander.
A drunk, young LADY-OF-THE-EVENING, in a soiled DRESS,
stumbles from the tavern, MUTTERING under her breath.

The Young Lady starts down the SIDEWALK, none too steady.
She's passing a MAN walking the other way.

YOUNG LADY
Pardon, Sir... spare a few bob?

As the MAN'S brushing by her...

YOUNG LADY
Willing to make it worth your while,
squire. What do you say?
(watching him go)
Snotty.

Young Lady SPITS after him, walking on.
She heads down a dark ALLEYWAY.

ACROSS THE STREET, from a DARK ALCOVE: a MAN steps into
view. He's handsome, dressed in BLACK, wearing a tall, TOP
HAT and an enveloping CLOAK reaching almost to the ground.
He grips a CANE capped by a SILVER, horned DEVIL'S HEAD
handle with RUBY EYES. Let's call the man JACK.

Jack swiftly crosses towards the ALLEYWAY.

As he reaches the opposite sidewalk, he treads upon a
discarded NEWSPAPER headlined: "2ND RIPPER VICTIM FOUND!"

DOWN THE ALLEY

Light FOG hangs low. Young Lady's meandering along,
muttering to herself, while... Jack follows, cape flowing,
looking to be certain no one else is around.

Young Lady HEARS Jack's FOOTSTEPS, looking back...

She sees Jack coming. She walks faster, unnerved.
Jack walks faster.
Young Lady may be drunk, but she's not stupid. She runs.

Handsome Jack strides after, confident she won't escape.
He's sweating, excited, with an awful gleam in his eye.

JACK'S HAND twists the devil-head top of his CANE and
unsheathes a long, glinting KNIFE BLADE.

Young Lady's running, deathly afraid, trying to hike up her
skirt so she can run faster.
Jack's closing fast, when...

The Wolfman drops from above...
SLAMMING Young Woman to the ground!

Behind, Jack stops dead in his tracks, startled.

Young Lady's CRIES die quickly as the Wolfman'S DIGGING HIS
TEETH INTO her throat, THRASHING!

Jack witnesses, appalled by the sight, sickened.
AT THE MOUTH OF THE ALLEYWAY
Jack sprints out from the ALLEY, shoving by TWO burly
FACTORY WORKERS. The men curse him as he continues fleeing.
Jack trips and FALLS... SPLASHING into an enormous puddle in
the street, losing his HAT. He scrambles up and keeps
running as fast as his legs will carry him.

EXT. LONDON OVERVIEW -- NIGHT
In the distance, on a high TRAIN TRESTLE, we can see THE
WOLFMAN making his way along the top of the angular, iron
structure. A long TRAIN steams by in the other direction.
cur TO:
INT. WALLED ENCLOSURE -- NIGHT
SOUNDS of EXOTIC BIRDS are HEARD. The Wolfman pulls himself
up atop a tall WALL, remains there, crouched, sniffing at
the night air. He drops down inside the wall.

He's entered a lush GARDEN of sorts, filled with exotic
PLANTS and TREES. He moves warily through, hunkered.

The Wolfman hesitantly approaches a large, placid POND.
He crouches at the water's muddy edge, begins scooping water
to his mouth, drinking, ever watchful.

86.

As the Wolfman drinks, we PULL BACK: beyond IRON BARS to
reveal that this GARDEN is actually an enclosed ZOO HABITAT
which, according to its SIGN holds a...

 

“Crocodylus niloticus;
Nile Crocodile."

IN THE ENCLOSURE, Wolfman continues sating his thirst at the
pond's edge, in a rare moment of quiet calm. He stops
drinking, leaning forward to peer curiously into the water...

He's transfixed by his own REFLECTION for a long moment.

Then, just as the REFLECTION is broken by RIPPLES...
An enormous CROCODILE LUNGES UP from the water, reaching out
his massive jaws to CLAMP DOWN on the Wolfman's leg!

The crocodile performs a DEATH ROLL, DRAGGING the Wolfman
back with him into deeper water!

The Wolfman's YELPING, clawing and fighting back...
He SLASHES at the crocodile, managing to extricate his torn,
BLOODY leg from the croc's craggy-toothed mouth.

In the frothing water, the two behemoths WRESTLE!
It's a brutally violent, life-and-death struggle!
The crocodile SLAMS the Wolfman with his powerful tail...

The Wolfman lands at the water's edge, dazed.
The HISSING crocodile attacks from behind!

The Wolfman rolls, barely. avoiding the croc's gnashing jaws!

The crocodile twists, snapping after the Wolfman...
Wolfman climbs on the crocodile's back, gripping the croc's
head in both hands -- PULLING with all his might!

Kneeled on the crocodile's back, with the savage reptile
THRASHING beneath him, the Wolfman's PULLING the crocodile's
head back further... further still, until finally -- the
crocodile's SPINE is HEARD SNAPPING grotesquely!

The croc goes MOTIONLESS. The Wolfman releases his grip.

The Wolfman rises, spent, staggering away from his defeated

foe, bearing BLEEDING WOUNDS from the encounter.

The Wolfman lets out a long victory HOWL.

From not far away, another HOWL answers.

The Wolfman turns, his eyes widening. |
He HOWLS again. Several HOWLS reply. |
EXT. LONDON ZOO, WOLF CAGE -- MOMENTS LATER !

CIRCULAR CAGE which is home to FIVE full-grown WOLVES. The |

Wolfman's equally excited, circling, watching as the
imprisoned wolves follow his every move.

 

The Wolfman vaults over the spectator RAILING, getting a
grip on the cage's METAL BARS. He presses his face to the
bars, puzzling over them, angrily rattling them.

The Wolfman starts trying to bend the bars; PULLING at them.
The wolves pace back and forth, vocalizing frantically.

The Wolfman keeps trying, using his inhuman strength --
beginning to BEND the creaking BARS APART!

EXT. LONDON CEMETERY -- NIGHT

In the middle of this vast, hilly CEMETERY, with tall
GRAVEMARKERS, BURIAL VAULTS and eerie STATUARY for as far as

By LANTERN light, a greasy-faced, shabbily-dressed, middle-

aged GRAVEROBBER and his FOUR, young STREET URCHIN i
accomplices (Artful-Dodger-types), strain at ROPES tied {
around a COFFIN they're hoisting up from an exhumed GRAVE. :

They manage to set the heavy COFFIN beside the open grave,
propping it up on the DIRT MOUND they've dug.

GRAVEROBBER
That's the way, lads. A little bit
of effort leads to good things,
aren't I always saying?
(smiles his CROOKED SMILE)
Now... let's see how good!

Graverobber pulls the COFFIN LID OPEN. He and the Four
Urchins grin in at the CORPSE of the well-dressed MAN.

GRAVEROBBER
Hello, Mister Sir! Glad to meet you!
Pleasure's all ours!

Graverobber and his urchins LAUGH, setting to work, quickly
and efficiently removing anything of value; taking RINGS
from the man's fingers and CUFF LINKS from his cuffs.
Extracting a WATCH FOB and GOLD POCKET WATCH while plucking
BUTTONS from the man's SHIRT and SUIT. Graverobber pries
open the corpse's mouth, leaning close to look inside.

The youngest urchin, blonde~haired and rosy-cheeked,
BLONDIE, occupies himself removing the deceased's SHOES.

Graverobber LAUGHS again, but the laugh catches in his
throat as he spots one of the wolves.

Graverobber stands as the urchins all turn, looking...
The wolves have them surrounded.

GRAVEROBBER
Alright, my lads... let's be calm
about this... nice and caim...
Graverobber licks his lips, looking to a SHOVEL sticking up
from the dirt mound. Meanwhile, the closest wolf begins
edging forward, GROWLING menacingly.

GRAVEROBBER
On the count of three... run.

Graverobber slowly reaches for the shovel, watching as that
most aggressive wolf creeps even CLOSER...

GRAVEROBBER
1... 2... 3... RUN!

The urchins scatter! Graverobber grabs the shovel just as
the first wolf LEAPS at him!

Graverobber SWINGS the shovel, BASHING the wolf aside!
The YELPING wolf goes tumbling!

The four other wolves all RUN OFF...
Following the urchins in different directions.

Graverobber raises the shovel, preparing to swing again, but
he's losing his footing in the loose dirt...

He TRIPS backwards over the coffin, coffin LID SLAMMING as
he FALLS down into the deep, dark GRAVE!

IN THE GRAVE: Graverobber's hurt, groaning, trying to rise.
DIRT FALLS IN onto him as he's looking up...
Just in time to see the COFFIN SLIDING...

ELSEWHERE AMONGST THE GRAVESTONES

Blondie, our favorite urchin, runs for all he's worth, still :
hugging the dead man's SHOES to his chest.
Two ravenous wolves are right behind.

Blondie glances back, terrified. Ahead, there are TWO
VAULTS close together. It's a tight fit, but Blondie
disappears down the NARROW SPACE between them...

When the two wolves arrive side-by-side, their attempt to
follow becomes a SNARLING FIGHT over right of way.

FURTHER ON

Blondie ducks down in the shadow of a massive GRAVEMARKER,
pressing against the cold stone, hiding. The SNARL of the
wolves is soon HEARD. Blondie watches as, down the ROW of
GRAVES, the two wolves arrive, prowling.

The wolves SNIFF at the ground, heading Blondie's way.

Blondie notices for the first time that he's still got the
shoes. He swallows, deciding. Carefully trying to make as
little noise as possible, Blondie THROWS one shoe...

The SHOE'S HEARD landing a few rows down.
The two wolves immediately raise their heads.
They rush off in the direction of the sound.

Blondie grins, relieved. He stands slowly, craning his neck
to make sure the coast is clear. Something WET starts
DRIPPING down onto his shoulder. Blondie notices, looking
at the droplets... RED droplets.

Blondie looks straight up...

ABOVE, standing balanced atop of the huge GRAVEMARKER, is

the Wolfman leering down. He DROPS, letting out a ROAR!
CUT TO:

EXT. ST. PAUL'S CATHEDRAL -- NIGHT

Amidst the boundless LONDON CITYSCAPE...

The Wolfman climbs towards the peak of the spectacular DOME

of ST. PAUL'S CATHEDRAL.

The Wolfman reaches up at the FULL MOON, HOWLING loudly...
HOWLING with a kind of disconsolate yearning.

FADE TO BLACK

FADE IN:
EXT. BUILDING ROOF -- DAWN

A hard RAIN FALLS. On a high ROOFTOP overlooking the city,
Lawrence, in human form, lies face down, unconscious.

He stirs, awakening. He drags himself to his feet, holding
his head in pain, noticing the WOUNDS on his leg.
He touches the wounds, not fully understanding.

Lawrence looks down at his tattered, blood-stained SHIRT and
PANTS. He examines his hands and forearms, which are
covered in SCRAPES and LACERATIONS. There's BLOOD under his
FINGERNAILS. Now, realization begins to come to him.

As Lawrence turns to look out over the storm shrouded CITY,
the full weight of the lost evening crashes down upon him.

He falls to his knees, numbed by the horror of it, the RAIN
washing over him. He breaks down ~- afraid, ashamed,
enraged -- WEEPING into his hands.

cur TO:

INT. CHURCH -- MORNING

The CHURCH'S dark interior is meager in scale and adornment.:

PEWS are empty. An elderly PRIEST lights CANDLES near the
entrance. Lawrence enters, still in his wet, torn clothing,
slowly walking up the CENTER AISLE.

. PRIEST
May I assist you, son?

LAWRENCE
I'll only be a moment.

PRIEST
Is there something you need? Do you
wish confession?

Lawrence stops, standing in DARKNESS, without turning.

LAWRENCE
It's a little late for that.

Lawrence continues. Halfway up the aisle, he takes a seat,
kneeling. Pale LIGHT filters in through the STAINED GLASS
WINDOWS behind a large CROSS over the ALTER. All is QUIET.
Lawrence puts his hands together, lowers his head.

LAWRENCE
(quietly)
I'm not here to ask forgiveness.
What things I've done...

LAWRENCE (CONT.)
(pause)
I don't even remember. I do know I
will pay for them. I am damned. I
am damned, and there will be a
reckoning, soon enough.

(pause)
I ask one thing, though I have no
right. I beg of you... let me do

what needs to be done. Give me the
strength I'm afraid I don't have.

Lawrence looks up, hands still clasped.

LAWRENCE
Give me the courage to finish this.

CuT TO:
INT. CONLIFFE HOUSE, UPSTAIRS PARLOR -- MORNING
In the PARLOR of this upper middle-class, 3-story ROW HOME,
Gwen works mending CLOTHING at a SEWING MACHINE. She's
weary from lack of sleep. GWEN'S FATHER enters, a man of
kindly appearance, wearing a look of great worry.

GWEN'S FATHER
Gwen, dear.

GWEN
Yes, Father? What's wrong?

GWEN'S FATHER
You'd... better come.

IN THE DOWNSTAIRS ENTRYWAY

Gwen walks down the STAIRS to the front of the house,
uncertain, followed by Father. GWEN'S MOTHER, a stout,
handsome woman, stands in the HALLWAY, likewise worried.
Mother looks to the FRONT DOOR. Gwen follows her gaze...
A FIGURE can be seen through the DOOR'S TRANSLUCENT GLASS.
Gwen crosses quickly, going to OPEN the FRONT DOOR...

ON THE PORCH, Lawrence stands, desolate, soaking wet and
shivering, holding himself against the cold.

Gwen can barely believe her eyes, overcome by emotion.
She takes his hands, bringing him inside, SHUTTING the DOOR.

cur TO:
INT. UPSTAIRS PARLOR -- DAY

FIRE in the FIREPLACE. Lawrence sits in a CHAIR, wearing
clean, new CLOTHING (borrowed from Gwen's father).

He gazes into the flames. Gwen stands at one WINDOW, j
watching the RAIN. A large, mantel CLOCK is HEARD TICKING. oo

LAWRENCE

Finally... when I awoke, it was with
no real memory of last night.
Except, of bloodshed. An orgy of
violence.

(pause)
The curse has been passed on from the
father to the son.

(troubled pause)
And, there is one last thing. I'm
certain that Benjamin tried to stop
my father.

(hesitant)
I'm just as certain that my father
killed Benjamin.

Gwen's bathed in the day's cold, pale light.

LAWRENCE
I'm so very sorry.

GWEN
As you say it... I know it's true.
I've known I need to begin mourning
him.
(pause)
I just don't know if I can bring
myself to accept it.

Gwen brushes away tears. Lawrence stands.
LAWRENCE
There isn't much time. I've nowhere
else to turn.

GWEN -
What can I do?

LAWRENCE
If you can manage it, I need enough
money to get a horse.

GWEN
Why? Where will you go?

Lawrence does not answer. Gwen realizes.

GWEN
No. You can't go back there.

LAWRENCE
I have to.

CONT INUED
 

GWEN
You said yourself, he killed Ben...
killed so many others. He'll kill
you.

 

LAWRENCE
He has already, Gwen. He has. It
will be a full moon again tonight.
{looking at his hands)
Even now, I feel it... like a
crawling beneath my skin; a burning
in my veins. I have till before
midnight to get to Blackmoor and to
end my father's life. And then...
(pause)
Then, I will do what it takes to end
the curse in me.

Gwen's shaking her head, agonized.

GWEN
There must be some other way... {
LAWRENCE '
There isn't.
GWEN
There must be! This... this can't be
happening!
LAWRENCE

I can't run, not from this. Not this
time. There's no one else. It's my
turn to be the one to face
responsibility.

Lawrence crosses to Gwen, his voice thick with emotion.

LAWRENCE

Nothing in heaven or on earth can
change what's happened, or what
happens tonight. Nothing can stop
the moon. But, I'd have given
anything that our paths might have
crossed in some other life. If we'd
have only had a chance somehow.

Lawrence takes Gwen's hand in his.

LAWRENCE
I confess... there is a part of me
praying that if I'm able to avenge my
brother, he may forgive my feelings
for you. Feelings I've fought so
hard against, please believe me...

Lawrence KISSES Gwen's hand. Her heart is breaking.

CONTINUED
94.

LAWRENCE
Forgive me.. Let Benjamin forgive me.

Gwen takes Lawrence's face in her hands, presses her lips to
his. They KISS gently, both crying.

GWEN
(quietly)
Pray he'll forgive us both.

LAWRENCE
Goodbye, Gwen.

GWEN
No. Please, don't go...

LAWRENCE
Goodbye is all we have left; all life
ever had for you and me.
(whispers)
Goodbye.

Tearfully, they share one last KISS.

EXT. LONDON STREET CORNER -- DAY

GLOOMY SKIES. PEDESTRIANS everywhere. Streets are clogged
with VEHICLES. Lawrence, wearing a COAT, makes his way down
the crowded SIDEWALK, passing a young STREET HAWKER waving

a NEWSPAPER with a PHOTO of LAWRENCE under the HEADLINE:
"ESCAPED MENTAL PATIENT! Brutal Killings in the Night!"

STREET HAWKER
(droning sales-pitch)
Read it here. Escaped Mental
Patient. Escaped Mental Patient.

Lawrence hides behind his jacket collar, moving on, but then
he halts. Ahead, TWO POLICE CONSTABLES stroll this
direction. Lawrence quickly turns, hoping he's not been
seen, now facing the Street Hawker.

STREET HAWKER
(still droning)
Escaped Mental Patient. Escaped
Mental Patient.

Street Hawker does a startled double-take: looking at
Lawrence, looking to the NEWSPAPER, then back at Lawrence.
His voice takes on a newfound urgency...

STREET HAWKER
(POINTING at Lawrence)
Escaped mental patient!

STREET HAWKER (CONT.)
Escaped mental patient! Escaped
mental patient!!

Lawrence turns to hurry back the way he came...
Comes face-to-face with another POLICE CONSTABLE.

POLICEMAN
Just one moment, Mister...!

The Policeman's brings a WHISTLE to his lips, putting a hand
on Lawrence. Lawrence grabs the Policeman's arm, TWISTING,
pulling him forward, then SHOVING him back!

The Policeman goes SPRAWLING over Street Hawker's NEWSPAPER
DISPLAY and STACK of PAPERS, but he's BLOWING his WHISTLE

Lawrence wheels to see...
The TWO CONSTABLES reacting, RUNNING this way.

Lawrence charges straight at them. The lead Constable's
raising his BILLY CLUB, but Lawrence lowers his shoulder and
DIVES into them -- KNOCKING both Constables to the ground!

Lawrence ROLLS, scrambling to his feet. He RUNS...
SHOVING Pedestrians... TOPPLING STREET VENDOR TABLES...
He darts into the busy street...
Disappearing in the CROWD.

muddy ROADWAY, leaving LONDON behind.

eyes bleary from crying. She just sits there, motionless,
staring at the sewing machine for the longest time.

INT. CONLIFFE HOUSE, SITTING ROOM -- NIGHT

Gwen's Mother and Father are seating in the SITTING AREA.
She pretends to occupy herself KNITTING. He pretends to be
cleaning out his PIPE over a pedestal ASHTRAY.

Mother looks over her knitting to watch Father absently poke
a PIPE CLEANER into the pipe, his mind elsewhere.

GWEN'S MOTHER
Why don't you see how she's doing?

Father looks over, tosses the pipe aside, rising.

Gwen's Father comes up-the STAIRS to a closed DOOR.
GWEN'S FATHER

Gwen's Father KNOCKS, looking in...

The room's empty. Father's troubled, seeing...
The WINDOW'S OPEN to the FIRE ESCAPE outside.

A FOUR HORSE COACH speeds away with LONDON in the B.G.,

Gwen's Father is at the open window. As he steps back, he
notices a single BULLET beside the SEWING MACHINE.

Gwen's Father rushes in. He goes to the bed, getting on his
hand and knees to reach under. He pulls out a small, metal
STRONGBOX, flipping it open.
It's empty, except for a few BULLETS.

Lawrence stares for a long, steely-eyed moment.

Cur TO:
INT. BLACKMOOR FOREST -- NIGHT !
Lawrence rides his horse quickly on a FOREST TRAIL... |
Arriving at the Talbot GRAVEYARD. At the GATE, Lawrence
jumps down. He walks in amongst the HEADSTONES. .
Mother's ornate TOMB beckons, touched by SHAFTS of MOONLIGHT.
INSIDE THE TOMB

The heavy DOOR is slowly pushed inwards, inch by inch, till
Lawrence is able to squeeze through, entering.

Brushing aside COBWEBS, Lawrence sadly looks upon mother's
STONE SARCOPHAGUS, which rests on a PEDESTAL. He steps
forward. There's another COFFIN beyond mother's...

 

A plain, WOODEN COFFIN on the floor.

Lawrence is filled with dread, kneeling beside this coffin.
He removes the LID, reacting to the smell of death. ‘

INSIDE THE COFFIN: a MAN'S ROTTEN CORPSE. Almost three
months old, altered by desiccation and decay. Skeletal.
Its CLOTHING is CLAWED, SHREDDED, covered in old BLOOD.

LAWRENCE
Benjamin.

Lawrence swallows, tearful. He's found his brother at last.
He places a hand on the corpse's chest.

LAWRENCE
My brother. I'm sorry. I left
you... abandoned you to him. I've

regretted it for so long now.
Forgive me. Forgive me, that this is
our reunion.

(agonized)
How can it be that I never met the i
man you became? How could I have let i
that happen? :

He stands, looking down at Benjamin's corpse.

Rest in peace. Know that what I do
tonight, I do in your name.

Lawrence rides at full gallop towards the mansion.
AT TALBOT HOUSE

IN ONE WINDOW: SIR JOHN'S SILHOUETTE can be seen as he's
looking out, till he lets the CURTAIN fail CLOSED.

INT. TALBOT HOUSE, GRAND HALL -- NIGHT
So eee ae

Shoving the FRONT DOOR OPEN, Lawrence strides in, throwing
off his COAT. He's clutching Ben's REVOLVER, crossing into
the Grand Hall with its walis of PAINTINGS, CRESTS,
TAPESTRIES, WEAPONS, TROPHIES; Talbot history.

ACROSS THE ROOM, Sir John is seated in a CHAIR by the
massive FIRE in the FIREPLACE. He holds a BOTTLE of SCOTCH. :
The room is lit by CANDLES held in CANDELABRA. j

SIR JOHN
Well, well! An unexpected visitor!
You are cutting this awfully close,
aren't you...?

Sir John gestures behind him...
Where the large GRANDFATHER CLOCK shows: 11:45.

SIR JOHN
Fifteen more minutes, and you and I
won't be ourselves anymore. Or is
that it; have you come to join your
father for a night out on the town?

Lawrence arrives, gathering his nerve, pointing the gun.

LAWRENCE
Stand up.

SIR JOHN
I'd have Kendall attend to you, but
he's fled. Took my goddamn dog with
him, the bastard. Have a drink? i
Sir John drinks from his bottle.

LAWRENCE
Stand up, Sir!

SIR JOHN
As you wish.

Sir John rises, imposing as ever.

CONTINUED i
99.

He's well dressed, but more disheveled than usual, unshaven.
There's no sense of drunkenness, but the man, like his
manor, is deteriorating.

SIR JOHN
Calm yourself. You're the one with
the weapon, after all. I could have
armed myself if I'd wanted... shot
you down the moment you walked in.

LAWRENCE
Why didn't you?
SIR JOHN
(shrugs)
Call me sentimental. You came all
this way... you deserve a sporting

chance.
Sir John walks as he talks. Lawrence keeps the gun trained.

SIR JOHN
You're not entirely unexpected. The
asylum sent word of your "escape,"
though accounts varied wildly, as you
might imagine.

LAWRENCE
I found Benjamin. I finally found
him where you left him. This is his
gun. These... his bullets...

Lawrence opens the gun, takes out one SILVER BULLET.

LAWRENCE
Silver. He loaded this weapon with
silver bullets...

Lawrence puts the bullet back, closes the gun.

LAWRENCE
Once he realized that there was no
other way to stop you.
(holding up REVOLVER) i
Tell me again you didn't kill him.
Deny it, while I hold the proof.

Sir John looks away, tortured, guilt eating at him.

SIR JOHN
The irony is... we forged those
bullets together, long ago. A last
resort, we agreed. One I was
confident we would never need.

(angrily remorseful)

He put himself in harm's way.

CONT INUED
SIR JOHN -(CONT.)
Out on the moors, that night. I...
I never meant for him to die! How
should I have known he'd side with
them? How was I to know he'd turn
against his own father!?

LAWRENCE
Because he was so mucn better a man
than you.

SIR JOHN

You'll hear no argument from me.
Sir John swigs morosely from his bottle.

LAWRENCE

You killed him with one hand, buried

100.

him with the other, and still managed

somehow to remove yourself from

blame. It was Ben's fault, because
he tried to protect the villagers.
My fault you attacked me, because I

had been warned. Mother died not at

your hands, but at the hands of the
beast.

(furious)
All of my life... I thought this
family cursed. But, you were the
curse on us, Father! All along, it

was you.
SIR JOHN
You come here to speak for
Benjamin... to avenge him...?
Sir John's still pacing.
SIR JOHN

First, answer how you can even dare
call him your brother! Or did you
imagine a handful of letters across
the years could make up for your
betrayal? Because that's what your
leaving was... a betrayal!

It's Lawrence's turn to face his wounding guilt.

SIR JOHN
You know full well how you wronged
him... how it was as if a part of

himself was torn away when he found
you gone. He loved you!

(pause)
For those wounds you inflicted upon
him... I admit could never have
forgiven you.

CONTINUED
101.

LAWRENCE
What of the wounds you inflicted?

SIR JOHN
He may not have been able to bring
himself to tell you what he truly
thought of you, but Ben and I... we
spoke often of your cowardice.

LAWRENCE
You needn't remind me of my debt to
him. I'm here to repay some part of
it tonight.

Lawrence looks across to...
The GRANDFATHER CLOCK. It's 11:49.

LAWRENCE
As for cowardice... it means so
little coming from a man who, having
torn out the throat of his beloved
wife, hadn't the courage to end his
own life.

SIR JOHN
Again, think what you will of me and
the suffering that's been my lot. I
don't expect you to believe me, but
I would've gladiy traded places with
your mother if I could have...

LAWRENCE
Easy to say.

SIR JOHN
As it was, my death would have done
nothing more than to orphan my sons.

LAWRENCE
And all the better for it we would
have been! Or have you forgotten...?
You murdered us! One by one, you
murdered us all! Look around!

They're standing at the center of the Grand Hall.

LAWRENCE

This is what remains of the family
you speak of with such reverence.
Your trophies... the sound of your
own voice... the ghosts of your
victims. That's all you have left!
Everything else you destroyed.

(bitterly)
All for Carmilla.

CONTINUED
SIR JOHN
Don't you speak her name.

 

LAWRENCE
Her own love was proven, beyond a
doubt. She suffered endless
humiliations, though she could have
had her freedom merely by confessing
your name. But, she kept silent...
to protect you. Out of love.

Lawrence keeps the gun trained on Sir John.

LAWRENCE
You, meanwhile, kept a different
silence. Having weighed your
feelings for her against your
instinct for self-preservation. You
wouldn't dare risk your social
standing or the precious honor of the
Talbot name! So, you abandoned her
to her husband's tender mercies. And
she took her life... alone.
Heartbroken.

Sir John drinks, sunk in grief.

LAWRENCE
You were the end of her... not
Strickland... not the citizens of
Blackmoor! You were her reason for
living and her reason for dying!

Sir John wheels, THROWING his bottle...
It SHATTERS against the wall!

SIR JOHN
No more! I'll hear no more!

LAWRENCE
For you to commit murder in her name
and call it vengeance is a sick
perversion of her memory.

SIR JOHN

(enraged)
Then be done with me! Enough talk!
End it now! That is a gun in your
hand, is it not?! Oh, but first...
first let me inform you of one small
detail. You see, before you came
in... I took the liberty of turning
the clock back ten minutes.

ZOOM IN: on the GRANDFATHER CLOCK which now reads, 11:50.
CONTINUED
102.

SIR JOHN
(angry mocking)
So...the time you thought you had in
which to screw up your courage is
gone! This, son, is your moment of
truth!

Lawrence is unnerved, uncertain. He looks up as...
The BLACKMOOR CLOCKTOWER is HEARD TOLLING from the distance.

Sir John steps up, defiant, pounds his chest.

SIR JOHN
Here is your chance to finally show
your father what you are made of!!
If you think you have it in you to
pull the trigger, DO IT! Do it.

Lawrence grits his teeth, angry, terrified...

He's leveling the revolver squarely at Sir John's chest, but
the gun TREMBLES in his hand. With the far off CLOCKTOWER
TOLLING, all Lawrence's years of fear of and pent-up hatred
for his father culminate in this decisive instant.

LAWRENCE
When I first arrived... you asked
what difference my returning to
Talbot Hall could make.
(pause)
Here is your answer!

Lawrence PULLS the TRIGGER...
The HAMMER FALLS, but NOTHING HAPPENS!

Lawrence and Sir John are stunned.

Lawrence pulls the trigger again! Nothing!

Sir John's disbelief turns to rage as he KNOCKS the gun
away -- PUNCHING! Lawrence is thrown to the floor!

SIR JOHN
Good God, you did it!

Lawrence tries to rise, but Sir John KICKS him down!
Sir John's manic, seems almost proud.

SIR JOHN
The grave's damp must've gotten to
the powder, but still... a valiant

effort! I honestly didn't think you
had it in you!

Lawrence is on his feet, letting out a CRY as...

He TACKLES Sir John! They go CRASHING through the sitting
area, scattering the CHAIRS and SIDE TABLES.

They fight in front of the roaring FIRE, trading blows.

CONTINUED
104.

Sir John's fists STRIKE like sledgehammers!

Lawrence manages to block one of his father's swings,
countering with a PUNCH that sends Sir John to the floor.

Sir John wipes his bloodied mouth as he's rising.

SIR JOHN
Nicely done!

Lawrence is immediately on Sir John, pinning him, getting
both hands around Sir John's neck

Lawrence puts everything he's got into tightening his
STRANGLE HOLD on his father's windpipe! Sir John struggles

And just when it seems like Lawrence has the upper hand...
Just as Sir John's having the life choked out of him...

Sir John STARTS TRANSFORMING! His TEETH LENGTHEN and become
florrid FANGS! His reddening face GROWS its grey-tinged FUR
while his HANDS SPROUT dense FUR and lethal CLAWS!

Much to Lawrence's dismay, he's now fighting the brutally
powerful GREY-WEREWOLF in MID-TRANSFORMATION! Grey—Werewolf
breaks Lawrence's grip, brings one leg up and KICKS -- sends
Lawrence FLIPPING backwards in the air...

Lawrence THUDS to the floor across the room.
Grey-Werewolf rises, the "change" complete. He looks
around, furious and disoriented, as one might imagine.
He announces himself with+a window rattling ROAR! —
Lawrence covers his ears as he's getting to his feet.

Grey-Werewolf turns, heading for Lawrence, nostrils flaring
saliva dripping from his wicked maw.

Lawrence goes to a dusty SUIT of ARMOR, taking the long,
deadly SPEAR the posed KNIGHT was holding.

As Grey-Werewolf advances, thirsting for carnage, Lawrence
wields the spear. Grey-Werewolf doesn't seem to care or
understand the spear, till Lawrence...

SLICES into Grey-Werewolf's arm! Grey-Werewolf backs off
bloodied. Confused. Lawrence keeps SWINGING the spear,
keeping Grey-Werewolf at bay.

Lawrence maneuvers over to grab an unlit OIL LAMP from a
WRITING DESK against the wall, THROWS the LAMP...

The oil lamp SHATTERS against Grey-Werewolf, SOAKING the fur
of his arm, torso and beastly face with OIL.

Undeterred, Grey-Werewolf advances...
Lawrence is backed up against the desk, trapped.

CONTINUED
He raises the spear -- STABBING...

The spear PIERCES Grey-Werewolf below his left collar bone;
the SPEARHEAD bursting bloodily out Grey-Werewolf's back!

Grey-Werewolf SCREAMS, staggered, clutching the spear.

Lawrence runs over to the mounted GUN RACK where many of Sir
John's PISTOLS and RIFLES are displayed.
He grabs a large SHOTGUN.

ACROSS THE ROOM

Grey-Werewolf grasps at the spear, but the spear's flared,
arrowhead-like point is impossible to pull out backwards.

AT THE GUN RACK

Lawrence clutches the SHOTGUN as he kneels before the low,
long, wooden GUN CABINET. He throws the CABINET DOORS open,
pulling out a heavy WOODEN BOX.

Lawrence opens the box. It's filled with ALL KINDS of
AMMUNITION. He grabs a BOX of SHOTGUN SHELLS, however...
The VEINS on the back of Lawrence's hands THROB! FUR is
starting to GROW! It's happening. Transformation's begun

LAWRENCE
NO!

Lawrence looks over his shoulder to where...
Grey-Werewolf still struggles to remove the spear.

Lawrence looks over his other shoulder to...
The FIRE in the fireplace.

ACROSS THE ROOM

Grey-Werewolf falls to his knees, falling on the spear's
shaft, which drives it further into his body!

AT THE GUN RACK

Lawrence sucks air, struggling against the irresistible
forces overtaking his physiology. He slams the AMMUNITION
BOX SHUT, lifting it as he stands, fighting a wave of pain.

FUR is APPEARING across Lawrence's face as he runs..
He stumbles to the fireplace, lifting the closed ammunition
box and HEAVING it INTO THE FIRE! Mission accomplished.

Lawrence's body contorts involuntarily, taking him to his
knees. His TRANSFORMATION'S PROCEEDING in earnest.
His body QUAKES as his lupine alter-ego's winning out!
106.

ACROSS THE ROOM

Grey-Werewolf's pulling the spear towards him -- hand over
hand -- FEEDING its entire length through his body till the
bloody spear finally CLATTERS to the floor behind him.

Grey-Werewolf turns his attention back to Lawrence...
Except, Lawrence is now THE WOLFMAN, ROARING!

AT THE CENTER OF THE ROOM

Grey-Werewolf and the Wolfman circle each other...
They're sizing one another up...

They both rush forward, GRAPPLING...
It's a vicious, werewolf vs. werewolf battle royal!
They CLAW at each other, SLASHING, teeth GNASHING!

Grey-Werewolf and the Wolfman THROW each other around the
room ~- SMASHING into walls -- TOPPLING BOOKSHELVES and
bringing PAINTINGS and WEAPONRY CRASHING DOWN!

He grabs onto the huge, wooden CHANDELIER above, SWINGING as
the straining ROPE holding the chandelier CREAKS.

Grey-Werewolf runs, JUMPS...

CLIMBING straight up a vast TAPESTRY. He JUMPS again...
DIGGING his CLAWS into the ROOF BEAMS, climbing towards the
center of the room, above the chandelier.

IN THE FIREPLACE: the ammo box shifts, engulfed in FLAMES.

LANDS standing astride the still wildly CAREENING

Grey-Werewolf hangs on relentlessly, BITING DEEPLY, while
Wolfman's CLAWING back at him, trying frenziedly to throw
him off, and it's just then that...

IN THE FIREPLACE: the burning ammo box EXPLODES!

The massive EXPLOSION throws a huge FIREBALL -- SHOOTING
whistling BULLETS and PELLETS in every direction at once!

The BLAST sends the Wolfman and Grey-Werewolf FLYING in a
shock-wave of burning DEBRIS and sizzling BULLETS!
WINDOWS are SHATTERING!

The Wolfman SLAMS into one wall, landing in a heap, his body
bearing many SMOLDERING BULLET WOUNDS.

Grey-Werewolf's fallen by the STAIRS, rising up and
SCREAMING as half his body is BURNING! The LAMP OIL that
soaked his fur is now ablaze!

Grey-Werewolf writhes, spastically trying to shake off the
flames, which only makes it worse. He FLEES headlong into

The explosion has doomed Talbot Hall.
EXT. REAR GARDENS -- MOMENTS LATER -- NIGHT
The Wolfman leaps out the jagged HOLE in the conservatory
WINDOWS. He lands in the GARDENS, searching warily.
He heads for the FOREST.

Gwen looks out the COACH WINDOW, horrified upon seeing...
In the distance: TALBOT HALL BURNS.

EXT. FOREST / CASTLE RUINS -- NIGHT

The Wolfman enters the clearing presided over by the looming
CASTLE RUINS. He searches, SNIFFING the air, watchful.

As he nears the ruins, a huge STONE comes SMASHING DOWN -—-
barely missing him -- imbedding into the ground!

The Wolfman looks up to where...

Grey-Werewolf stands atop a high, CORNER TOWER, HURLING
another huge STONE down!

The Wolfman dodges the deadly projectile, runs and LEAPS...
He starts quickly SCALING the tower.

Above, Grey-Werewolf's terribly wounded; upper TORSO, ARM
and half his FACE sickeningly BURNED; the FUR BURNED OFF.
He YELLS down, KICKING loose a section of the BATTLEMENT...
The Wolfman scrambles aside to avoid the falling STONES.

EXT. TALBOT HOUSE -- NIGHT
As the coach arrives, Gwen leaps out.
She and the Driver look on in awe as SMOKE and FLAMES pour
from the MANSION'S broken WINDOWS and open FRONT DOOR.
Gwen runs to the STAIRS, past where Lawrence's HORSE is tied.
INT. TALBOT HOUSE, GRAND HALL -- NIGHT
Gwen enters, surrounded by FLAMES. She covers her mouth and
nose, taking in the heat-warped scene of destruction.
FIRE SPREADS irrevocably, consuming everything.

GWEN

(calling out)
Lawrence! Lawrence!

CLOSE-ON: the beautiful PORTRAIT of LAWRENCE'S MOTHER as
it's BURNING. FLAMES hungrily devour ancient paint.
MOTHER'S FACE blisters... her image disappearing into ash.

Gwen looks straight up, retreating as.
Above, the ROPE holding the chandelier BURNS, FRAYING.

Gwen flees into the ENTRY PARLOR, not looking back as the
CHANDELIER CRASHES THUNDEROUSLY down behind her!

EXT. TALBOT HALL - -- NIGHT
Gwen runs down the front stairs, calling...

GWEN
Where are you, Lawrence?!

CONTINUED

A far off HOWLING is HEARD. Gwen turns, listening intently
Another ROARING CRY comes from the distance.

Gwen runs to Lawrence's horse, untying it and climbing up.
She RIDES off to follow the werewolf's ululation.

EXT. CASTLE RUIN -- NIGHT
EELS,

Just as the Wolfman climbs atop the corner tower,
Grey-Werewolf makes a spectacular LEAP...

Grabbing onto the curved, outer wall of the larger,
neighboring TOWER; the CASTLE KEEP. Grey-Werewolf climbs.

Behind, the Wolfman JUMPS after...
Actually leaping INTO one of the gaping HOLES in the side of
the keep; climbing the exposed SPIRAL STAIRCASE INSIDE...

AT THE TOP OF THE KEEP

The Wolfman and Grey-Werewolf arrive simultaneously in the
remains of this large, circular, ROOFLESS ROOM at the
highest point of the ruins. They square off, both letting
loose nightmarish CRIES of RAGE! But, neither is going back
down, of course, and so the pitched BATTLE is REJOINED...

They start RIPPING INTO EACH OTHER...
SLASHING and COUNTER-SLASHING, unrelentingly...
Sending BLOOD SPRAYING up into the night air

Grey-Werewolf SWINGS, but the Wolfman catches the blow and
BITES a CHUNK out of Grey-Werewolf's forearm!

Grey-Werewolf SPINS, BASHING the Wolfman back...

Wolfman SLAMS against a WALL which immediately FALLS AWAY,
exposing the PRECIPITOUS DROP beyond.

Then, the whole TOWER'S SHAKING...

BELOW: FISSURES begin spider-webbing across the tower's
already FRACTURED surface.

The Wolfman and Grey-Werewolf continue their animalistic
Danse Macabre, trading LACERATING STRIKES, the both of them
covered in countless crimson SLASHES and GOUGES.

Suddenly, a RUMBLE is HEARD, growing DEAFENING as...

The FLOOR literally FALLS OUT from under the Wolfman and
Grey-Werewolf! The entire TOWER is CRUMBLING DOWN!

We lose sight of the Wolfman and Grey-Werewolf in the
AVALANCHE of falling STONES and rising DUST!

ON THE FOREST TRAIL
FOLLOW: Gwen riding quickly, holding her PISTOL, arriving...

AT THE RUINS

Gwen rides into the clearing, looking to the DUST CLOUD
hanging over the castle. As she urges her horse forward...

Grey-Werewolf rises into view, climbing RUBBLE to the stand
atop a low section of broken RAMPART WALL; he's carrying the
unconscious Wolfman over his head in both hands!

Gwen is aghast.

Grey-Werewolf HOWLS to the sky, throwing Wolfman's
motionless body to the forest floor below.

Grey-Werewolf leaps down...
Moving to where the Wolfman lies unconscious.

GWEN
No!

Gwen struggles to control her rearing horse, taking aim --
FIRING her pistol repeatedly!

BULLETS STRIKE around Grey-Werewolf! He's HIT in the ARM,
BLOOD SPLATTERING! He turns to face Gwen, SNARLING!

Gwen keeps firing, but her GUN'S gone EMPTY.
She yanks on her reins, RIDING AWAY...
Grey-Werewolf angrily gives chase.

FURTHER UP THE FOREST TRAIL

Gwen rides full out, glancing back...
From the DARKNESS, Grey-Werewolf is closing the distance.

EXT. FOREST / WATERFALL -- NIGHT

Just as Gwen races into the WATERFALL CLEARING...
Grey-Werewolf JUMPS onto her horse's REAR HAUNCHES...
DRAGGING the SCREECHING horse down!

Gwen is THROWN to the dirt...
Grey-Werewolf's THROWN, ROLLING.

The wounded horse clamors to it's feet, fleeing.
Gwen recovers, running towards the CLIFF and roaring
WATERFALL ahead. Grey-Werewolf pursues.

Grey-Werewolf LEAPS forward...
Taking Gwen to the ground!

Gwen SCREAMS, trying crawl away, but the gory Grey-Werewolf
is astride her, holding her. He's bent over her, TOUCHING
her DRESS, almost gently, as if toying with her...

His claws TEARING the fabric.

CONT INUED
lll.

Gwen keeps CRYING OUT as Grey-Werewolf leans his monstrous,

burned visage very close to her face, breathing and drooling ;
onto her as he studies her, SNIFFING. He brings one hairy {
hand to her face, his claws faintly brushing her cheek.

Grey-Werewolf rears up, keeping a grip on Gwen, ROARING!
Another ROAR ANSWERS! As Grey-Werewolf wheels...

The Wolfman arrives at full speed, SLAMMING Grey-Werewolf,
‘KNOCKING him off of Gwen...

The Wolfman lands on top of Grey-Werewolf, begins POUNDING
ON HIM ~-- ROARING with RAGE!

The stunned Grey-Werewolf still keeps fighting; struggling
even as the Wolfman leans in and opens his fanged mouth
wide -- going for Grey-Werewolf's throat...

The Wolfman pulls himself closer...ever closer, till finally
he SINKS HIS TEETH IN -- RIPPING GREY-WEREWOLF'S THROAT OUT!

Gwen's on her feet, backing away.

The Wolfman rises, drenched in BLOOD, looking down as Grey-~
Werewolf dies. The Wolfman lets out a sustained HOWLING CRY.

Grey-Werewolf, lying dead, TRANSFORMS back into SIR JOHN.

Gwen turns, looking for an escape. : Too late as...
The Wolfman looks to her, moving towards her...

Gwen's trapped as the Wolfman begins circling.

GWEN
No, Lawrence... it's me. It's Gwen!

The Wolfman circles, never taking his burning eyes off her.
Gwen turns so she's always facing him, pleading.

GWEN
Lawrence, please. Don't do this!
Look at me! You... you know who I

am! You know me!
The Wolfman SNARLS, regarding her as easy prey.

GWEN \
This is not what you are! Your i
father did this! You are Lawrence
Talbot! There must be some part of
you left! Please... hear me...!

The Wolfman begins stalking towards her. Gwen's CRYING. |

GWEN
Remember what you said to today...
(more)

CONT INUED
GWEN (CONT.)
If goodbye is truly all we have...
this is mine. Know, that I had
feelings for you, Lawrence. Remember
that I loved you... I loved you too!

CLOSE-ON: GWEN REFLECTED in the Wolfman's narrowing eyes...
just as there seems to come some glimmer of recognition.

For a moment, the Wolfman's ghastly features soften as he
regards Gwen... like perhaps the man trapped inside the
beast has somehow resurfaced...?

The Wolfman edges closer, not threateningly, but with a kind
of curicsity. Gwen recognizes the moment.

GWEN
Lawrence?

Suddenly, the Wolfman rears back, HOWLING, arms extended,
claws clutching -- a lamenting, tortured HOWL.

Gwen recoils, covering her ears, stumbling back...
She falls to the ground.

The Wolfman charges at Gwen...
Gwen SCREAMS as he is upon her!

The Wolfman LEAPS over Gwen, running across the clearing,
moving straight for the CLIFF'S EDGE.

Gwen turns to look... realizing...

GWEN
No!

At the CLIFF overlooking the WATERFALL, the Wolfman LEAPS
out into MID-AIR... FALLING into the chasm...
PLUMMETING a great distance...

BELOW

The Wolfman SMASHES into the jagged CLIFFSIDE...
FLIPPING again and again as he...
FALLS...
ever downward...

His body being BASHED and brutalized, LIMBS RAVAGED...
BONES BREAKING, consciousness gone, till at last..

The Wolfman SPLASHES into the RIVER BASIN at the base of the
WATERFALL! He's immediately gone from sight below the
CHURNING WATER. He does not resurface.

ABOVE

 

Gwen staggers to the cliff's edge, looking down, her hand
over her mouth. She lets out an echoing CRY!

She kneels, hanging her head, bereft, SOBBING.
The FULL MOON shines down through the treetops.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. FOREST RIVERBANK -- DAWN

BIRDS SING. On the dawn-kissed banks of the RIVER, down-
stream from the roaring WATERFALL feeding it, we find...

LAWRENCE'S CORPSE, battered and broken. Human again.
Lying there, with his eyes closed, half-in the river while
the shore's gently undulating water caresses his hair and
placid face, Lawrence looks almost at peace.

FADE TO BLACK
FADE IN:
EXT. ENGLISH COASTLINE -- OVERVIEW -- DAY

Above the CLIFFS of a section of English COASTLINE, with the
OCEAN pounding rocky SHORES below, we find the relocated
GYPSY ENCAMPMENT. MALE and FEMALE TRIBE MEMBERS go about
their daily lives amongst the settlement's TENTS and WAGONS.

IN THE ENCAMPMENT

At the CLIFF'S EDGE, the ancient, fortune-teller, Old
Maleva, peers out across the endless OCEAN.

She turns, heading back through the camp.
IN ONE TENT

Old Maleva enters. A BABY can be HEARD CRYING. THREE young
GYPSY NURSE-MAIDS are crowded around a veiled, INFANT'S
CRIB. As they see Olid Maleva approaching, they step away.

Old Maleva comes to part the crib's VEILS, reaching in to
gently pick up the crying BABY, a dark-haired BOY, mere
months old, wrapped in BLANKETS. His EYES are GREEN.

Sullen, sallow-faced Bela enters.

Old Maleva goes to sit, cradling the child lovingly.

Bela walks to stand at Old Maleva's side. Old Maleva begins
reciting a SING-SONG an INCANTATION in a whispered,
incomprehensible tongue, gently rocking the now quieting
child back and forth in her arms.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. BLACKMOOR FIELD -- DAY

Where the Gypsy encampment once stood in Blackmoor; where
all that is left are the THREE unmarked GRAVESTONES. ..

We PAN DOWN: into the very earth... INTO CARMILLA'S GRAVE...
Where we are able to look upon the rotted, withered face of
CARMILLA'S ENSHROUDED CORPSE inside her WOOD COFFIN, and we
can see the wide, dried-brown BLOOD STAIN left from the
long, still gaping INCISION that was CUT INTO HER WOMB.
