EXT. CAMPSITE - AFTERNOON

A lush campsite, in the woods. A smattering of RV’s and
campers, a few TENTS, spaced out from each other for privacy.

Legend: 1980

VIOLET (7) steps out of a small CAMPER, heading away as her
MOTHER leans out of the door.

VIOLET’S MOTHER
Where are you going, Violet?

VIOLET
Just to pick some flowers!

VIOLET’S MOTHER
Don’t wander too far!

EXT. CAMPSITE, WOODED PATH - MOMENTS LATER

Violet moves down the path, stopping to look at some WILD
FLOWERS growing beside her. She glances up, seeing SEVERAL
RV’S and MOTOR HOMES in a cluster, just visible off the path.

We don’t know it yet, but these belong to the TRUE KNOT.
Unaware of their danger, Violet heads further down the path.

EXT. CAMPSITE, STREAM - LATER

Violet emerges into a clearing on the banks of a quiet,
pristine river. Sunlight reflecting off the water, lovely
wildflowers growing by the bank...

She's startled to see a WOMAN sitting by the water, almost
hidden by the overgrowth. Holding a fistful of FLOWERS,
throwing pedals into the stream as she sings...

ROSE
My wild Irish Rose / The sweetest
flower that grows / You may search
everywhere / But none can compare
with my wild Irish Rose...

She is beautiful, dressed in flowing, strange clothes and a
black TOP HAT. She is ROSE THE HAT (looks 30's, but is so, so
much older). She turns to Violet, smiling sweetly.

ROSE (CONT'D)
Well hi there.
2.

Violet stares at Rose’s flowers. BRIGHTER, more COLORFUL than
the wildflowers she’s found...

VIOLET
Where did you find those?

ROSE
Oh, these? I know all the secret
places. You want one?

Violet doesn’t answer. Studies Rose’s face. She has a sweet
demeanor, a KIND, EARNEST SMILE...

ROSE (CONT'D)
Oh... you’re wondering why I’m
wearing such a funny hat. Well I'll
tell you. I always wear this hat.
So much it’s part of my name now.
My friends, my very best friends,
they just call me “Rose the Hat.”
You can call me that, now that
we're friends.

VIOLET
I like it. It looks like a
magician’s hat.

ROSE
It is! It’s a magic hat, wanna see?

Rose removes her hat. Violet watches, her wariness fading.

ROSE (CONT'D)
Take a look. Nothing in my hat,
nothing up my sleeves...

Violet STEPS FORWARD again, so that she can see inside the
hat. It’s EMPTY. Rose turns it over, shaking it for effect.

A SNAPPING BRANCH draws Violet’s attention. She turns, seeing
a MAN lurking at the edge of the woods. STARING AT HER. He is
CROW (40's, dressed in dirty clothes.) PERFECTLY STILL.

ROSE (CONT'D)
Don’t worry, he’s my friend. You're
missing the trick! Reach inside.

Violet hesitates... and then reaches her hand out, into the
hat... pulling up a HANDFUL OF BEAUTIFUL FLOWERS.

VIOLET
Wow... they’re so pretty --
ROSE
Because they’re special. Speaking
of special... you’re a little magic

too, aren’t you.
Rose reaches into the hat, her hand disappearing from view.

ROSE (CONT'D)
The flower in my hand. What color
is it?

(off Violet's hesitation)
It’s okay, honey. You won’t scare
me. I’m not like mom and dad.

VIOLET
Purple.

Rose smiles, lifting up a GORGEOUS PURPLE FLOWER.

Another SNAPPING TWIG, and Violet looks. There are MORE
PEOPLE now, standing at the periphery of the woods.

ROSE
Violet. Like you.

She turns. She doesn’t remember telling Rose her name...

Rose turns over the hat, and FLOWERS POUR OUT OF IT onto the
ground. Violet’s eyes light up. She stoops, picking up a few
of them. Rose does the same -- and EATS a flower, right off
the stem.

VIOLET
You don’t eat flowers!

ROSE
Oh, but you do.

VIOLET
But these are special.

ROSE
The special ones taste best.

More SNAPS, and Violet turns to see SIX PEOPLE, members of
the TRUE KNOT, watching from all around them. Flanking her.
They are Crow, BARRY THE CHUNK (40's, heavy), GRAMPA FLICK
(ancient), APRON ANNIE (30's) and SILENT SAREY (50's).

VIOLET
I should get back to my mom...

She starts to pull away, but CAN’T. She looks down: ROSE’S
HAND GRIPS HER FOREARM. TIGHT.
ROSE
Stay a while. See more magic.

Violet starts to PULL against Rose’s grip, but it is VICE-
LIKE. Behind her, THE TRUE KNOT ADVANCES ON HER. SILENT.
Their movement STRANGE, INHUMAN - closing in on all sides...

ROSE (CONT'D)
You are a special little thing,
aren’t you.

She squeezes Violet’s arm as the pale faces speed up,
barreling toward her silently. Rose’s fingernails DRAW BLOOD
on the girl’s forearm. And Rose is STILL SMILING.

EXT. CAMPSITE - LATER

Violet's mother walks up the path, a little concerned.

VIOLET’S MOTHER
Vi? Violet!

Silence. She glances down at the wildflowers growing by the
path, frowning to herself. Behind her, we see the TRUE KNOT’S
RV’S DRIVING AWAY. She barely glances at them.

VIOLET’S MOTHER (CONT’D)
(panic growing)
Vil Violet! Violet!
As her panic grows, the small group of RV’s exit the
campground unnoticed as she heads deeper in the woods,
calling for a daughter that will not answer.

CUT TO:

EXT. OVERLOOK HOTEL - NIGHT

Snow. Snow as far as we can see, so bright in the moonlight
it almost seems to be giving off its own light. The camera
floats above it, tilting up to reveal:

THE OVERLOOK HOTEL. Half-buried in the snowfall.

INT. OVERLOOK HOTEL, CORRIDORS - NIGHT

The camera follows a boy on a tricycle. We recognize him
immediately... YOUNG DANNY TORRANCE (5) riding his tricycle
down the familiar hallways. Turning corners, moving fast.
5.

He comes to a stop in front of a specific room. ROOM 217. We
gradually realize why he stopped, and why he stares... THE
DOORKNOB IS TURNING. SOOOOO SLOWLY...

As he watches, the door CREEPS OPEN, revealing ABYSSAL
DARKNESS WITHIN. And then, just as slowly, a FIGURE STARTS TO
MATERIALIZE IN THE INKY BLACKNESS...

A GROTESQUE WOMAN, NAKED, GREEN WITH ROT, DRIPPING WET, JUST
BARELY STEPPING OUT OF THE DARK WHEN --

INT. DANNY’S BEDROOM, FLORIDA - NIGHT

-- DANNY'S EYES FLY OPEN. He BOLTS UP in bed, gasping from
the nightmare. COVERED WITH SWEAT, his dream still fresh. He
catches his breath, and quietly climbs out of bed.

INT. CONDO HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

A door, the name “DANNY” displayed in construction paper,
opens as Danny steps into the small condominium. He heads
toward the BATHROOM at the end of the hall.

The door is CLOSED as he approaches, and he slows down.
Surprised to see it closed... He steps toward the door,
cautious. Listening. And then, faintly...

WE HEAR A SOUND THROUGH THE DOOR. A QUIET SLOSHING OF
WATER... LIKE SOMEONE SHIFTING IN A BATHTUB.

Danny hesitates. Afraid to open the door, but telling himself
that he’s being silly -- it’s all in his head... He slowly
turns the knob, and OPENS THE DOOR, REVEALING:

A WOMAN, IN THE TUB, SITTING IN THE DARK. Lit only by
MOONLIGHT. Obscured by the shower curtain. She slowly reaches
up, pulling the curtain back. We know who she is:

MRS. MASSEY. The WOMAN IN THE TUB. Her skin green and
bloated, her hands purple with coagulated blood. Her eyes
dead and white, like a fish’s belly. We can almost SMELL the
putrid rot as she GRINS AT DANNY --

The filthy water SLOSHES as she slowly STANDS, naked, her
body waterlogged and rotting. A purple foot LIFTS from the
water, STEPPING ONTO THE BATHMAT.

Danny’s bladder LETS GO, a puddle forming at his feet.

She LUMBERS TOWARD HIM as Danny CLOSES THE DOOR, stepping
back into the hall.
6.

He stares, wide-eyed and terrified as A SHADOW APPEARS UNDER
THE DOOR. FILTHY WATER LEAKING OUT AS THE DOORKNOB SLOWLY
TURNS. LEFT, THEN RIGHT.

Danny COVERS HIS EYES, trying to WILL IT AWAY, even as he
hears DEAD FINGERNAILS SCRATCHING ON THE DOOR --

A HAND FALLS ONTO HIS SHOULDER, AND HE SPINS, SCREAMING -—
Into the face of WENDY TORRANCE (30's, exhausted. )

WENDY
Hey! Hey! It’s okay, it’s okay...

He RUNS into her arms, she holds him, alarmed and perplexed.

INT. DANNY'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Wendy PULLS a fresh pair of pajama bottoms onto Danny.

WENDY
There, all dry. What happened?

Danny doesn’t answer. Just stares ahead, CATATONIC.
WENDY (CONT’D)

Danny, you have to talk to me. You

haven’t talked since we left

that... place. Please, Doc. Please.
INT. CONDO HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
Wendy steps down the hall slowly, toward the bathroom door.
Steeling herself. Summoning a familiar courage -- a courage

she learned at the Overlook.

She reaches the doorknob, and only hesitates a moment before
opening the door and turning on the light.

The room is empty. Nothing in the tub, nothing out of the
ordinary. She exhales. She’s about to leave, hand on the
light switch, when she sees --

TWO SHAPES ON THE BATHMAT. WET DEPRESSIONS. FOOTPRINTS.

CUT TO:

EXT. MARINA, FLORIDA - DAY

Danny sits on a bench, looking out at the marina. Exhausted.
DICK (0.S.)
So you ain’t talkin’, huh Doc?

Reveal DICK HALLORANN (late 50’s, black) sitting beside him.

DICK (CONT'D)
Weren’t talking much first time I
met you, neither. Little boy, set
to spend a long winter at that
rotten old place, just him and his
mommy and daddy -- daddy’s dark as
that boy is bright and boy, is he
bright -- he’s Shining like fire in
the one place - the worst place -
for a boy who Shines.

(beat)
You remember the first time we
really talked? When I spoke up
inside your head?

Danny nods. Dick smiles. And then, Dick keeps talking... but
his mouth doesn’t move. He speaks IN DANNY’S MIND.

DICK (V.O.)
Made you feel good, right? Knowing
you weren’t alone?

DANNY
Daddy tried to kill me.

Dick notices that Danny used his “outside” voice, and follows
suit. No longer talking in his head.

DICK
It wasn’t all him, you gotta know.
That place fed his dark, like it
fed on your light. And he had some
light in him, too. Just like you
got some dark. We all got both --

DANNY
It’s not done with me.

DICK
It ever strike you funny, how I
showed up when I did? When you
needed me? Someone did that for me
too. My gramma taught me and I
tried to teach you and some day,
Danny Torrance, you'll teach
someone else-

DANNY
I won't.
DICK
Oh you won’t, huh.

DANNY
I won’t Shine, I mean. No more.
It’s dangerous.

DICK
Reckon it is, sometimes.

DANNY
She found me. She’1l come back and
come back until she gets me.

DICK
You're right. Overlook’s condemned.
Boarded up. They’re starving old
ghosts and they’re reaching out for
you. Won’t stop with her, either.

DANNY
Pictures in a book. You said they
were just pictures in a book, and
they couldn’t hurt me.

DICK
Thought they was.

DANNY
But they aren’t. They’re real.

DICK

Some things, dark things, the
Shining’s like food. They're
mosquitos, landing for blood.

(beat)
The Overlook, it was always just
pictures to me, but I didn’t Shine
like you. Nobody Shines like you.
So you, in that damn hotel... you
was like a million-watt battery,
all plugged in, and it ate it up.
You made it real, started soon as
you walked through the door.

DICK (CONT'D)
Can't do nothin’ about that, I’m
sorry to tell you but you’re not a
child, you're older now, much older
in a way, and you gotta hear this.
World’s a hungry place and the
darkest things are the hungriest
and they'll eat what Shines. Swarm
it. Like mosquitos, or leeches.

(MORE )
DICK (CONT'D)

Can’t do nothing ‘bout that. What
you can do is turn what they come
for against them.

Danny looks up at Dick. His old eyes are sad, weary.

DICK (CONT'D)

My grandfather, he was a mean
sonofabitch. Dark inside, same type
of dark as your dad. Beat me
senseless, and my gramma too, and
when he died I danced but he kept
on comin’ back. Standing in my
room, suit all grey and stinking,
from whatever mold was growing on
him in that box. One day he grabbed
me and he was real. His nails were
overgrown, growing long in the
grave and they cut me, Doc. Cut me
deep. And Gramma... she taught me a
trick. Gave me a present.

He reaches into his coat, and removes A SMALL METAL LOCKBOX.
Very old, rusted. And, a KEY. On a chain.

DICK (CONT'D)

I want you to know this box. Inside
and out. Don’t just look at it;
touch it. Stick your nose inside
and see if there’s a smell. Know
every corner. Every single thing.

DANNY
Why?

DICK

Because you’re gonna build one just
like it in your mind. One even more
special. So next time that bitch
comes ‘round, you’ll be ready.

(beat)
Let’s get you back to momma.
Wendy’1l worry and she shouldn’t
have to worry another day in her
life; that woman’s paid that debt.

They stand from the bench, walking back toward the shops.
Further out, Wendy is looking wildly around as she SPOTS
Danny approaching. She rushes toward him, relieved...

We realize DANNY IS WALKING ALONE. DICK IS GONE.

WENDY
There you are! Where did you go???
10.

She hugs him as we PAN OFF of them, resting on a TATTERED
MISSING POSTER ON A LIGHT POST... A POSTER OF VIOLET’S FACE.

CUT TO:

INT. CONDO, LIVING ROOM - ANOTHER NIGHT

Danny and Wendy sit on the couch, snuggling as they watch a
BUGS BUNNY CARTOON. Wendy laughs at the show, Danny smiles.
Content. BETTER. And then, he looks up. Toward the hallway.

DANNY
I have to pee.

He hops up, and Wendy watches him go. A little concerned...

INT. CONDO HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Danny turns the corner. Looking at the BATHROOM DOOR. It’s
SLIGHTLY OPEN... and he sees what he knew he’d see.

MRS. MASSEY, in the tub, BARELY VISIBLE through the door.

He takes a breath, and walks toward the bathroom. As he
nears, she SITS UP, GRINNING WITH HER ROTTEN TEETH. Danny
steps into the door as she CLIMBS TO HER FEET, filth and
water dripping from her.

DANNY
Hi Mrs. Massey.
(beat)
I brought you a present.

He CLOSES THE DOOR, we PULL BACK. SLOW. After a few beats...
MRS. MASSEY SCREAMS.

INT. CONDO, LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Wendy looks up as Danny returns. Calm, casual.

WENDY
You okay, Doc?

DANNY
Yeah, mom. I’m okay.

He climbs onto the couch, resting his head on his mother’s
shoulder. She can tell... HE’S OKAY. TRULY OKAY. And for the
first time in a long time, Danny SMILES.

CUT TO:
11.

INT. DEENIE’S BEDROOM - MORNING

DAN TORRANCE (mid 20’s now) awakes with a start. Pale,
sweaty. His face BRUISED AND SWOLLEN, fighting through one of
the worst (and last) hangovers of his life.

Legend: 2000

He’s in a FILTHY APARTMENT, a dirty mattress on a dirty
floor. He COUGHS, dry-heaving as he holds his throbbing head.
He rolls over, and stops as he sees --

DEENIE (early 20's, frail and sickly) asleep next to him.
Also naked. He stares, trying to remember --

INT. DIVE BAR - THE PREVIOUS NIGHT

Blurry flashes. Hazy memories. Dan, downing a shot of
whiskey. And another. Deenie, holding onto him while he
shoots pool.

DEENIE
(slurring)
What’s your name again, Cutey...

INT. DEENIE'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Dan stares at her. There’s VOMIT next to her mouth, staining
her pillow. As the sight and smell hit him --

INT. DEENIE’S BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Dan PUKES into the toilet, spitting out a vile mix of bile
and whiskey. Fumbles for the handle, barely manages a flush.

He THROWS water on his face, looking up in the mirror AND
SEEING THE CUTS AND BRUISES. One eye almost SWOLLEN SHUT. He
reaches up, perplexed. Touching the wounds...

INT. DIVE BAR - THE PREVIOUS NIGHT

-- More whiskey. A LARGE MAN trying to pull Deenie away from
him. Dan, getting in the man’s face. A PUNCH that lands Dan
on the ground. Spitting out BLOOD, getting to his feet - a
familiar DARKNESS in his eyes.

-- A hand, grabbing a BILLIARD BALL. Dan, SMASHING THE BALL
into the man’s head. Straddling him now, as others SCRAMBLE
TO BREAK UP THE FIGHT. Dan’s hand, smashing the ball into the
man’s head AGAIN. And AGAIN. And AGAIN.
12.

DAN
(between blows)
You gonna take - your - medicine --

INT. DEENIE'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Dan STUMBLES, catching himself on the dresser. Looks down at
his BLOODY, BRUISED KNUCKLES. HIS HANDS SWOLLEN.

DAN
Oh god...

He looks back at the sleeping girl, and then at THE WHITE
POWDER, STILL ARRANGED IN SLOPPY LINES, on the nightstand
beside her. NEXT TO THE EMPTY WHISKEY BOTTLE.

INT. DEENIE’S BEDROOM - THE PREVIOUS NIGHT

Dan PULLS HARD from the whiskey, WINCING as Deenie SNORTS A
LINE OF COKE from the nightstand.

DEENIE
Holy shit, I think you killed him.
What if you killed him. I hope you
killed him. I hope you killed him,
you hear me?
Deenie, STRADDLING HIM NOW.

DEENIE (CONT'D)
Lemme kiss it better.

She kisses him, hard, pushing him back onto the mattress.

INT. DEENIE’S LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Dan STUMBLES out, pulling his clothes on. Looking at the
BLOOD ON HIS SHIRT. Not all of it his...

And then he realizes something. He pulls out his WALLET... NO
CASH. Digs through his pockets. NOTHING.

DAN
Fuck. Fuck...

He turns his pockets out, frantic now. All of his money,
gone, probably snorted by the naked girl in the other room --

HER PURSE. There, on the table. Open. Dan stares at it, and
after a long pause, he moves toward it.
13.

He opens her wallet, looking through. There’s CASH there,
maybe $100. Tens and twenties, crumpled...

AND FOOD STAMPS. A pile of food stamps.

He slowly removes the cash, conflicted. Looking back through
the open bedroom door, where she snores softly. He POCKETS
THE CASH, heading toward the door when --

TODDLER (0.S.)
Mommy?

He stops cold. Turns. Standing in the doorway to another
bedroom is a TODDLER, maybe 18 months. Staring at him. Dan
DEFLATES a little. Confused, concerned... humiliated.

DAN
What’s your name, hero?

The kid just stares at him.

DAN (CONT'D)
Please tell me you came from next
door. Or down the hall...

TODDLER
Momma...

Dan sighs. Oh, shit. He goes to the kid. Picks him up --

AND SEES THE BRUISES on the boy’s arms. The kind you get from
being GRABBED. REALLY HARD. He carries the boy into the
bedroom, placing him next to Deenie.

TODDLER (CONT'D)
Momma!

He cuddles against her, and even in her stupor, Deenie wraps
a hand around him. Dan watches, heart breaking a little.

He makes his way toward the door, stopping one last time by
her purse. Looking at the food stamps, the little boy cuddled
up next to Deenie... And at the CASH in his hand.

DICK (0.S.)
You can put her money back, Doc.
You can do that much.

He looks up. Dick is standing in the shadows, HIDDEN.
DAN

She took mine. Probably spent it on
the coke --
14.
DICK
Doc.
Dan stares him down. After a moment, tucks the money in his
pocket. He turns back, looking at Deenie and the boy.
Squints, concentrating. For a moment, a FLASH of --
THE LOCK BOX, with the rusty lock.
DICK (CONT'D)
Oh no, Doc. You can put things from
the Overlook away in boxes, but not
memories. Never those. They’re the
real ghosts, you take ‘em with you.
Dan stares at him defiantly, and walks out the door.

CUT TO:

INT. ABRA’S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - EVENING

DAVID (30's) and LUCY (30’s) turn the corner, following the
sound of PIANO MUSIC. Stilted, promising... YOUNG ABRA (5
years old, adorable), sits at the piano in the living room.

LUCY
Time for bed, Abra.

YOUNG ABRA
A little more??

DAVID
No sweetie, big day tomorrow.

YOUNG ABRA
Birthday party!

DAVID
That's right. But for now, bedtime.
INT. ABRA’S HOUSE, ABRA’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

David and Lucy tuck Abra into bed. Handing her a STUFFED
BUNNY, which Abra CUDDLES happily.

YOUNG ABRA
Abba’s five! Happy birthday Abba!

LUCY
Not just yet. Goodnight sweetie.

They leave her tucked in, closing the door softly.
15.

INT. ABRA’S HOUSE, MASTER BEDROOM - LATER

David and Lucy are fast asleep. Slowly stirred by a sound...
PIANO MUSIC, echoing through the dark house.

INT. ABRA’S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

David and Lucy make their way down the stairs, the music
LOUDER NOW. It seems Abra’s snuck out of bed, and gone back
to the piano. As they turn the corner, they STOP COLD.

There is no one in the room. But THE PIANO IS PLAYING, the
same song Abra was struggling with earlier...

CUT TO:

INT. MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT

ANDI STEINER (15, sharp and pretty) sits in the dark theater.
Munching on candy as an older BUSINESSMAN (50s) makes his way
down the aisle, sitting next to her.

She doesn’t look up from her candy as he sits.

BUSINESSMAN
Andi?

ANDI
That’s right.

BUSINESSMAN
You're prettier than your picture.

ANDI
You’re older than yours.

He looks around, a little nervous.
BUSINESSMAN
So are we staying here or going

somewhere?

ANDI
Don’t you want to watch the movie?

He frowns. But soon softens as she SNUGGLES UP to him, laying
her head on his shoulder. His HAND finds her THIGH.

We pull back to reveal ROSE and CROW, sitting a few rows
back. Not watching the movie. Watching ANDI.
16.

ROSE
I don’t see what the fuss is about.
Chat room romance. A little gross,
but not interesting.

CROW
Watch. It’s interesting, I promise.

ROSE
It better be. Because she’s not all
that steamy -

CROW
There she goes.

They watch as Andi PUTS HER LIPS TO HER DATE’S EAR.

ANDI
Aren’t you tired? Sleep.

The man’s head instantly DROPS to his chest. He’s OUT COLD.
She lifts his LIMP HAND off her thigh with disgust, and
fishes out his wallet. Starts PULLING CASH, credit cards.

ROSE
Okay.

CROW
Wait. This is the best part. I’ve
watched her do it three times now
and it never gets old.

Andi pulls a PEARL-HANDLED KNIFE from her purse.

ANDI
Sleep deeper. Deep as you can. The
pain you'll feel is only a dream.
What will the pain be?

BUSINESSMAN
A dream.

She puts her arm around him, and quietly SLASHES TWO TINY V’S
into his cheek. The blood FLOWS. He doesn’t even FLINCH.

ANDI
You can explain a lost wallet, when
your wife asks, but you can’t
explain this. This, you see every
day in the mirror. Every time you
see it, you’ll say it out loud...
“I like little girls.”

She finishes cutting, leaning closer to the sleeping man.
17.

ANDI (CONT'D)
You'll say it out loud.

BUSINESSMAN
Out loud.

ANDI
And the next time you go looking
for a little girl online, you’1l
remember that time you got bit by a
rattlesnake. A rattlesnake in a
blue skirt and white blouse, whose
face is a blank.

She kisses his bloody cheek, standing from her chair, quietly
leaving the theater. Rose and Crow watch, impressed.

ROSE
That is interesting.

EXT. MOVIE THEATER - MOMENTS LATER

Andi walks in the afternoon sun. The street is crowded, she’s
in a city. Behind her, CROW approaches.

CROW
“Scuse me, miss? Miss!

She ignores him, walking faster.

CROW (CONT'D)
You left something in the theater -

ANDI
You wanna leave me alone.

Crow STOPS. Blinks. Suddenly UNSURE of himself, as if he
FORGOT WHY HE WAS CHASING HER. Andi turns to leave when --

ROSE GRABS HER ARM.

ROSE
Well hi there.

Andi stares at her.

ANDI
You want to let me go.

ROSE
Oh no, sweetie. No I don’t.

CUT TO:
18.

EXT. OVERPASS, NEWARK - EARLY MORNING

Dan wakes up under the overpass, face down on a filthy towel
he’d spread out for himself the night before. A fresh bottle
in front of him, empty. Clutched in his cold fingers.

He COUGHS, spitting with his dry mouth. Looking around him.
Not even sure how he ended up here.

INT. GREYHOUND STATION - LATER

Dan stands at the ticket counter, looking at the crumpled
bills in his hands. His hands SHAKE, he’s DIRTY. Exhausted.

DAN
How far can I get for...

He counts out the bills.

EXT. GREYHOUND STATION - LATE MORNING

Close on the bus sign: FRASIER, NH. Passengers board quietly,
and Dan is among them. The last of his cash apparently went
to the BOTTLE he clutches, along with his beat-up knapsack.

CUT TO:

EXT. ABRA’S HOUSE, BACKYARD - AFTERNOON

DOZENS of kids and parents pack the yard, decorated for
Abra’s birthday party. David and Lucy watch Young Abra,
dressed in a birthday tiara and carrying her STUFFED BUNNY,
run toward them holding out a handmade card.

YOUNG ABRA
Mommy! I made this for you --
It’s a secret card!

Abra bounds away, toward the MAGICIAN who is gathering the
kids at the end of the yard. Lucy looks down at the card.

Just a simple word: hELL©
The MAGICIAN holds out a red TOP HAT to the kids.
MAGICIAN
Nothing up my sleeves, nothing up

my sleeves...

He reaches in, pulling out a WHITE RABBIT. The kids clap and
giggle, and he hands it to Abra.
19.

MAGICIAN (CONT’D)
Abracadabra!

YOUNG ABRA
I know magic too!

MAGICIAN
Well you get to hold him, birthday
girl.

She pets the bunny, watching.

He turns over the hat, and SILVER SPOONS fall out. The kids
laugh, delighted, as he picks them up and starts HANGING THEM
ON HIS FACE, the last one balanced on the tip of his nose.

YOUNG ABRA
I can do that.

MAGICIAN
That’s nice, sweetie.

EXT. ABRA'S HOUSE, BACKYARD - LATER

The party is over, the last of the kids trickling out. David
and Lucy clean up as Abra plays with the last of her friends.
David frowns at the birthday cake.

DAVID
We can forget nap time.

LUCY
Just a few more hours. Say it with
me, just a few more hours --

She smiles at him, heading through the open sliding glass
door into the house. As he carefully scoops up the cake --

LUCY (0.S.) (CONT'D)
(alarmed)
David...

INT. ABRA’S HOUSE, KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

David enters the kitchen, where Lucy stares. White as a
sheet. She’s pointing...

THE SILVERWARE DRAWERS ARE ALL OUT, as though they SHOT OUT.
FORKS AND KNIVES ALL OVER THE FLOOR.

DAVID
What the hell...
20.
LUCY
Dave...
Lucy POINTS AT THE CEILING. He follows her gaze --

ALL OF THE SPOONS are hanging from the ceiling. Dangling, as
though magnetized. Their tips barely touching the plaster.

They STARE at it as Abra enters. Stuffed bunny in her hand.
YOUNG ABRA
(proud)

Abra... cadabra!

LUCY
Honey, did... did you do this?

Abra’s smile fades. Her lip starts to quiver.

YOUNG ABRA
Am I in trouble?

They stare at her, not sure what to say -- as she STARTS TO
CRY, to REALLY LET LOOSE --

ALL OF THE SPOONS FALL DOWN AT ONCE, CRASHING TO THE FLOOR.

CUT TO:

INT. GREYHOUND BUS - SIMULTANEOUS

Dan STARTLES awake in his seat. SENSING SOMETHING, something
that woke him... as though REACTING TO THE FALLING SPOONS...

CUT TO:

EXT. CAMPGROUND, LONG ISLAND - SIMULTANEOUS

Rose STOPS in her tracks as she heads toward her RV, also
SENSING SOMETHING. Looking over her shoulder. A passing
thought, but something... some thing...

INT. ROSE’S RV, LONG ISLAND - MOMENTS LATER

Rose steps into the trailer. The moment forgotten as she
heads toward ANDI, who is just waking up on the bed.

ROSE
Hi there, sleepyhead. Sorry, I had
to sleep you pretty hard, you’re a
tough one. Willful.
21.

Andi sits up, rubbing her head. Taking in her surroundings.

ROSE (CONT'D)
You know I checked... six men, in
three months. With those little
snakebite tattoos on their cheeks.
You've been busy.

(beat)
Snakebite Andi, that’s who you are.
So who am I...

ANDI
You're some crazy bitch that
kidnapped me --

Rose holds up a finger. One finger, and Andi is SILENT.

ROSE
Just the truth, from now on. You’1l
only say the truth.

ANDI
(beat)
You’re the most beautiful woman
I've ever seen.

ROSE
Well golly. Works a little too
well, don’t it. Here’s the deal,
Snakebite Andi. You’re a pusher.
You can push people, and we haven't
had a pusher round here for a
little while so I’m gonna offer you
a deal I haven’t offered anyone in
almost forty years.

ANDI
No way you’re forty.
ROSE
How old are you, darling?
ANDI
Fifteen.
ROSE

Fifteen. God, what an age. The
Springtime of your womanhood, isn’t
it, you're not a girl anymore but
you don’t have a single dent yet,
either. Gravity hasn’t even noticed
you, not at fifteen.

(beat)
Men, though...
Andi lowers her head.

ROSE (CONT'D)

No! No shame, and you paid that
back, didn’t you. What I’m
offering, Snakebite Andi, is just
that: Springtime. Springtime
forever. Ten years from now, you’re
still fifteen. A hundred years,
maybe you’re seventeen. Live long,
stay young. Eat well.

ANDI
Sounds too good to be true.

ROSE
I know it.

ANDI
So you and your friends out there -—

ROSE
They're not my friends, they’re my
family. We’re the True Knot, dear.

ANDI
(snickers)
True Knot.

ROSE
What’s tied can never be untied.

Andi laughs. Rose, though, isn’t laughing.

ANDI
Do I have any other choice?

ROSE
Only bad ones, dear. But it’s
better if you want it. Makes the
turning easier.

ANDI
(beat)
Does it hurt?
Rose smiles, and lies.

ROSE
Not at all.

EXT. TEENEYTOWN, FRASIER NH - EVENING

Dan steps away from the bus station. Tired, beaten. Shuffling
through town, not even sure where he’s going. It’s MAIN
STREET New Hampshire, the evening hours seeing the streets
mostly deserted. A small town, with character.

He stops at a sign: VISIT TEENEY TOWN! FRASIER’S SMALL
WONDER. He looks beyond it, smiling to himself as he beholds
Teeneytown. It’s a MINIATURE REPLICA of the very street he’s
on, a tiny representation of the town he’s in.

Around it, a SMALL TRAIN - designed for toddlers - resting
idle on its tracks. Dan smiles. It’s strange, but welcoming
at the same time. He crouches, examining the locomotive.

BILLY (0.S.)
You like it?

Dan spins to face BILLY FREEMAN (late 40’s, kind.)

DAN
Sorry, I was just -

BILLY
That’s okay, people love to look at
it. Model train buffs, usually. We
keep em away in the summer when the
place is jumpin’, but this time of
year there’s no we, just me. And I
don’t mind.
(holds out his hand)
Billy Freeman. Town maintenance.

DAN
Dan Torrance.

BILLY
Just off the bus? Or you ridin’
your thumb?

DAN

Bus. What does this thing have for
an engine?

BILLY
Now that’s interesting. You ever
hear of the Chevrolet Veraneio?

DAN
Brazilian Suburban, wasn’t it?
Turbodiesel.
24.

BILLY
That's right! Instrument panel’s
from a Suburban too. Seats I put in
myself.
(beat)
What brings you to town, Dan
Torrance?

DAN
Not sure yet.

BILLY
Not many take the bus this far
North, less they’re looking for
work. You lookin’ for work?

DAN
Yeah, I am. Place to stay, too.

BILLY
Change of scenery? Or you running
away from something? Don’t mind my
asking, I hope. New face is all.

DAN
(beat)
Running away from myself I guess.

BILLY
Yeah, I know that look. Pretty
well, sorry to say.
(smiles)
Runnin’ away from yourself’s a
pickle. You take yourself with you,
wherever you go.

DAN
Ain't that the bitch.

BILLY
(considering)
I know Mr. Kingsley, from the
program, he helps folks out now and
again, if they’re worthy of help,
that is. You got references?

DAN
A few. Mostly janitorial, hospital
orderly stuff.
25.

INT. DAN’S ROOM, ELLIOT STREET - EVENING

Dan stands by as MRS. ROBERTSON (40’s) gives him a tour of
the LOFTY ROOM, at the top of the building. A view of the
mountains, a simple room. A bed, a bath. Billy watches on.

MRS. ROBERTSON
Rent’s eighty-five a week, payable
upfront. Billy paid your first two,
the rest are on you. Once you start
getting paid at Teeneytown. No
pets, no parties, no noise.

Dan looks at Billy, surprised. Billy just watches.

DAN
I’m a quiet tenant.

MRS. ROBERTSON
Last guy said the same. Math
student. Even let him paint the
wall all blackboard, so he could
scribble his little puzzles up
there.

She walks to the wall adjacent to the bed. A wall painted
over DARK, with CHALKBOARD PAINT. She reaches down, picking
up one of several pieces of COLORED CHALK by the wall.

MRS. ROBERTSON (CONT’D)
(writing)
Wasn’t quiet, no sir. Didn’t even
paint over this when he left, but
I’m glad he didn’t so I can make
this easy for you... so you see it
every morning, when you wake.

She steps back, revealing the writing: “85/wk. BEHAVE.” She
walks past him, stopping for a beat beside Billy.

MRS. ROBERTSON (CONT’D)
You sure you wanna vouch for this

pup?

BILLY
Pretty sure.

MRS. ROBERTSON
It’s your ass, Billy.

She leaves, and Dan looks to Billy. A long beat.
26.

BILLY
I’m downstairs, ground floor, if
you need anything. Find me tomorrow
and we'll talk about some work.

DAN
Why are you doing this? You don’t
know me.

BILLY
No I don’t. But I know the look,
like I said, and... sometimes I get
feelings about people. Hard to
understand, I guess.

DAN
(beat)
Easier than you think.

CUT TO:

EXT. BEACH - NIGHT

Andi lays flat on a lawn recliner, near the group of RV's.
The sounds of the waves, a sky full of blinking stars
overhead. A FIRE BURNING in the center. She’s nervous.

Around her, the members of the TRUE KNOT stand. Rose in her
hat, Crow beside her. Apron Annie, Barry the Chunk, Silent
Sarey watch as Grampa Flick regards them with ancient eyes.

ROSE
No fear.

ANDI
Who are these people -

ROSE
You'll find out, after. But this
here is Grampa Flick, and he’ll
lead us. No fear, understand?

Rose nods to Grampa Flick, who steps forward.

GRAMPA FLICK
We are the True Knot and we endure.

GROUP
Sabbatha hanti.

GRAMPA FLICK
We are the chosen ones.
27.

GROUP
Lodsam hanti.

GRAMPA FLICK
We are the fortune ones.

GROUP
Cahanna risone hanti.

GRAMPA FLICK
What is tied cannot be untied. Here
is a woman. Would she join us?
Would she tie her life to our life?

ROSE
Say yes.

ANDI
Yes.

Rose reaches down, lifting a SILVER CANISTER. Almost like a
THERMOS, but older. STRANGER. She holds it near Andi’s face.

Rose TURNS THE VALVE on the canister. A small, rueful sigh,
and a PUFF of silver MIST escapes. But it doesn’t dissipate
into the night air... IT HANGS.

ROSE
This one’s special. Her name’s
Violet, and there’s not much of her
left... she tastes like flowers.

Rose gently purses her lips, BLOWING the pocket of mist
softly. It FLOATS around Andy’s face.

ROSE (CONT'D)
Breathe deep.

After a beat, Andi BREATHES IT IN. ROSE HOLDS HER DOWN.
ROSE (CONT'D)
Embrace it. It’s the only way
through.
Andi SCREAMS in pain, shaking VIOLENTLY in the chair.

ROSE (CONT'D)
Take steam or die.

Andi CONVULSES, and as they stare at her, HER SKIN BEGINS TO
CHANGE -- BECOMING TRANSLUCENT, TRANSPARENT, in FLASHES --
CYCLING between human and something else --
28.

WE CAN SEE HER SKULL, SCREAMING UNDER THE SKIN OF HER FACE --

CUT TO:

INT. DAN'S ROOM, ELLIOT STREET - LATER THAT NIGHT

Dan is asleep in bed. Out the window, snow falls hard. A
SHUFFLING SOUND in the corner slowly stirs him. He opens his
eyes. Squints into the darkness... there’s nothing.

But he becomes aware of something else. FLIES, buzzing around
him. He realizes SOMEONE HAS THEIR ARM DRAPED OVER HIM -- A
DEAD ARM, ROTTING. FLIES CRAWLING ALL OVER IT.

He carefully reaches down, trying to LIFT THE ARM away, while
he starts to roll over TO SEE THE ROTTING SKIN of A NAKED
YOUNG WOMAN laying in bed beside him.

HE SLOWLY tries to drop to the floor beside the bed, almost
extricating himself from her grip when HER DEAD HAND GRABS
HIS ARM. He SHOUTS, and she slowly ROLLS OVER TO FACE HIM --

IT’S DEENIE. Eyes clouded over, BLOOD AND VOMIT coming from
her nose and mouth. LIKE SHE DIED OF AN OVERDOSE. She SMILES,
and when she speaks, she’s speaking through PHLEGM.

DEENIE
They haven’t found us yet.

He GASPS. CLOSES HIS EYES -- BUT SHE GRIPS HARDER, and when
he opens his eyes HER FACE IS INCHES FROM HIS OWN.

DEENIE (CONT'D)

They were used to hearing him cry,
‘cuz I left him alone so much... so
they didn’t do anything, and they
haven’t found us yet...

He stares. The flies CRAWL OVER HER OPEN, SIGHTLESS EYES.

Dan notices something else -- A SMALLER HAND, also PALE AND
ROTTEN, CLINGING TO DEENIE. She reveals the TODDLER, cuddled
against her. DEAD AS WELL.

TODDLER
Mama --

Dan SCREAMS. And SCREAMS. And the room is EMPTY. He SHAKES on
the ground, overwhelmed with horror. CRAWLS FAST toward the
bag at the foot of his bed, GRABBING FOR --

THE BOTTLE OF WHISKEY, half full, inside. He PULLS OFF THE
CAP, bringing it toward his lips --
29.

BUT STOPS THIS TIME. STARES AT IT. FOR A LONG TIME...

CUT TO:

INT. HALLWAY, ELLIOT STREET - LATER

A hand KNOCKS on a door. After a few long moments, the door
opens, revealing BILLY. Blinking at the late hour. Dan stands
in the doorway, TEARS ALL OVER HIS FACE. AT ROCK BOTTOM.

DAN
You said you knew my look. What’d
you mean?

BILLY
You're sick and you’re tired, I can
see that much. But are you sick and
tired of being sick and tired?

After a long beat, Dan says the words he’s struggled to say
for so long. The most important words he’1ll ever say.

DAN
I need help.

Billy nods. Smiles gently.

BILLY
Come on in. Let’s talk about it.

He steps aside, and Dan comes into the room.

CUT TO:

INT. AA MEETING - ANOTHER NIGHT

A group of RECOVERING ADDICTS sits in the dimly lit church
basement. At the podium, the moderator DR. JOHN (mid 60's)
stands to speak, leading the group in the prayer.

GROUP
God, grant me the Serenity, to
accept the things I cannot change,
courage to change the things I can,
and wisdom to know the difference.

Dr. John smiles at the room, holding out a box of CHIPS.
DR. JOHN

Anyone here have a year? Six
months?
30.

An ADDICT gets up, applause as they take their chip.

DR. JOHN (CONT'D)
Three months? Thirty days?

(as someone approaches)
Congrats brother.

He looks out at the group.
DR. JOHN (CONT’D)

And now for the most important

person in the room. Anyone here a

newbie? Someone got 24 hours?
Reveal DAN, sitting beside Billy. Tears in his eyes. Billy
smiles, encouraging, and after a moment, Dan STANDS UP.
INT. AA MEETING - LATER
Dan and Billy stand by the coffee machine, looking down at
the ONE DAY CHIP in his hands. Turning it over. Around him,

small talk and handshakes, some hugs.

Dr. John approaches, pouring his coffee.

DR. JOHN
Billy says you’re new to town.
DAN
Dan.
DR. JOHN
John.
BILLY

Doctor John’s been serving the town
most of my life. Delivered my
little brother.

DR. JOHN
Small towns. How you holding up
Billy?

BILLY

Train’s still runnin’.
Dan notices Dr. John rubbing his wrist, frowning.

BILLY (CONT'D)
You okay?
31.

DR. JOHN
Yeah, just... lost something.
Emma’s gonna kill me. Well good to
know you, Dan. Come back. Hope to
see you again soon.

They SHAKE HANDS. And in that moment, Dan KNOWS SOMETHING. He
watches Dr. John walking away.

BILLY
Good man. Really holds us together,
got a gift for -

DAN
Hang on.

He follows Dr. John, reluctant.

DAN (CONT'D)
Hey Doc... your watch.

Dr. John stops. Turns, looking at him quizzically.

DAN (CONT'D)
You lost your watch. You were
worried about the kid with
Goocher’s.

DR. JOHN
(beat)
What?

DAN
The kid. Goochers? Glutchers? Some
sort of bone thing.

DR. JOHN
(long beat)
Gaucher's disease.

DAN
Yeah... the terminal ones always
bother you, and you washed your
hands, the hospital bathroom, you
left it on top of the soap
dispenser. Your wife gave it to
you, it was your wedding present.

Dr. John stares. Not sure what to make of this.

DAN (CONT'D)
Check on top of the soap dispenser.

Dr. John nods, and starts to walk away. Dan sighs.
32.

DR. JOHN (PRE-LAP)
How’d you know that?

INT. DR. JOHN'S OFFICE - THE NEXT DAY

CLOSE ON the WATCH, back on Dr. John’s wrist.

DAN

Wish I could say. Lucky guess.
DR. JOHN

Guess my ass...

(beat)

Billy said you have orderly

experience.
DAN

That’s right.

DR. JOHN
You working right now?

DAN
Few shifts at Teeneytown. Helping
with the train, couple hours a day.

Dr. John sits back. Considering.

DR. JOHN
Well listen, I owe you a debt.
However you did it.
(beat)
I do three days a week at Rivington
House. Hospice. Tough to find good
orderlies, tougher to keep ‘em.

DAN
That sounds good to me, sir.

DR. JOHN
Dying people don’t bother you?

DAN
We're all dying. Whole world’s a
hospice with fresh air.

DR. JOHN
Okay, then. Done. Because you’re a
friend of Bill’s.

DAN
Billy’s got a lot of pull in this
town.
33.

DR. JOHN
(laughs )
Not Billy. Bill. We’re both friends
of Bill’s; Billy is too.

DAN
I don’t get it.

DR. JOHN
Keep comin’ to the meetings. You'll
figure it out.

CUT TO:

EXT. BEACH - DAY

Andi lays on the recliner, the sound of the surf starting to
bring her back. She blinks into the sun. The True Knot are
enjoying the beach, looking like relaxed campers. Grilling,
reading, enjoying the sun and the sand. As they see her, they
SMILE. Some CLAPPING.

ROSE
Well hi there.

Andi blinks. Rose’s hat almost blots out the sun.

ANDI

How... how long was I...
ROSE

Few days.
ANDI

You said it didn’t hurt.
ROSE

Doesn't now, does it.
ANDI

I felt like I was dying --
ROSE

You did.
ANDI

You brought me back.

ROSE
Couldn't have done it on my own.
You wanted to come, so you came.
You'll feel better when you eat.

She sits beside her, touching her knee. Gently.

ANDI
Am I still human?

ROSE
Do you care?

INT. ABRA'S HOUSE, ABRA'S ROOM - NIGHT
Lucy tucks Young Abra into bed. Puts the bunny in her arms.

LUCY
There you go.

YOUNG ABRA
(off her frown)
What is it?

Lucy doesn’t answer.

YOUNG ABRA (CONT’D)
(realizes)
You're scared of me.

LUCY
We love you more than anything in
the world, you hear me? Anything.

YOUNG ABRA
I didn’t do the spoons. I just
pretended it was me but it was the
real magician. From the party, it
was a birthday party trick he did
for me and you and daddy shouldn’t
be scared, it wasn’t me.

It’s a clumsy lie. A child’s lie... but a kind lie. And part
of Lucy appreciates it, even though she knows better.

LUCY
Goodnight, my heart.

She kisses Abra, and leaves the room.

CUT TO:
35.

INT. HALLWAY, RIVINGTON HOUSE - NIGHT

Dan MOPS THE FLOORS of the darkened halls. Sparely decorated,
patient rooms lined up left and right. As he does, he almost
mops over a CAT, who scuttles out of the way.

DAN
Sorry, Azzie.

The cat moves down the hall, SCRATCHING at a patient’s door
before pushing it open and slipping inside. Dan moves along,
lost in his work, as he passes the room. Glances inside.

An elderly PATIENT (80’s) lays on the bed, and Azzie the cat
perches at the foot of the bed.

DAN (CONT'D)
C'mon, leave him be.

The cat doesn’t budge. Shrugging, Dan starts to walk away...
but STOPS. A feeling comes over him.

He turns back, opening the door further. The cat just stares,
almost like it’s STANDING GUARD. Waiting for something. Dan
looks at it for a long time... and then steps into the room.

INT. PATIENT’S ROOM, RIVINGTON HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Dan steps inside, feeling uneasy. The patient STIRS.

PATIENT
Doc? Doc, that you?
DAN
(beat)
No, it’s... I’m not a doctor. Just

cleaning up, you want me to call
you a doctor?

PATIENT
C’mere. Please.

Dan steps toward him, leaning the mop on the desk. The man
looks SICK. One foot almost in the grave.

PATIENT (CONT'D)
Cat’s on my bed.

DAN
I can take him out --
36.

PATIENT
No, I knew he would be. That cat...
always seems to know when it’s
time. Guess it’s time.

DAN
No, it’s just Azreel being a silly
old cat --

PATIENT

Nope. Been that way since I got
here. The cat knows when it’s time
to go to sleep, everybody knows
that. I’m gonna die.

Dan hesitates... then REACHES OUT, taking the man’s hand.

DAN
(quietly)
Yes. You are. I’ll get someone --

PATIENT
Stay with me. Please.

Dan sits back down.

PATIENT (CONT'D)
Known it’s comin’. Doesn’t make it
less scary.

DAN
(long beat)
I know what scared feels like. But
tell you what, maybe it’s what you
said. Just going to sleep. Nothing
to be scared of, sleeping. Maybe
you wake up some place better.

PATIENT
You’re a strange type of Doctor.
DAN
I’m not a doctor.
PATIENT
I think y’are.
(laughs )

Doctor Sleep. You'll stay, right?

The man sighs, relieved. Looks up at the ceiling.
37.

PATIENT (CONT'D)

I’m just scared, Doc, scared it'll
hurt or be dark or be nothin’ at
all, and I don’t wanna --

Dan CLOSES HIS EYES, CONCENTRATING. PROJECTING...

DAN (V.O.)
(in the man’s mind)
Nothing to be scared of.

The man CALMS, listening as though it’s his own thoughts.

DAN (V.O.)
Just going to sleep. Finally. True,
restful sleep.

PATIENT
Thank you, Doc. Thank you.

DAN
I shouldn’t be here, let me get you
a real doctor --

PATIENT
No, this is exactly where you
should be. Exactly.
(beat)
I see my wife...

And then, one LONG, RATTLING BREATH. As Dan stares --

A FINE CLOUD OF RED MIST rises from the patient’s mouth.
Tendrils of red smoke, gently rising from his mouth and nose.
Dan watches the small cloud of mist HOVER above the bed...

AND DISSIPATES into the air with a sigh. Then, the patient is
perfectly still. IT’S OVER.

Dan watches as Azzie the cat GLIDES DOWN from the bed, calmly
leaving the room. Heading back into the hallway. Dan sits
there for a long time, looking at the man.

And realizes, for the first time in years, a PURPOSE.

CUT TO:

INT. DAN'S ROOM, ELLIOT STREET - LATER

Dan steps into his room, still in his scrubs. Something
different about him now. Something profound. He seems
PEACEFUL, settled.
38.

He moves to the bed, sitting to remove his shoes... and
notices something odd. On the blackboard, ALL OF THE WRITING
HAS BEEN ERASED. No more rent, no more “behave.” In its
place, a single word:

hELL©

Dan stares it for a long time. Processing. And then... walks
to the board. Picks up a piece of chalk, and writes: “HI”
INT. ABRA'S HOUSE, ABRA'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

In her bed, in the dark, Abra GIGGLES. Like she heard him...
and then, rolls over to sleep.

INT. DAN'S ROOM, ELLIOT STREET - CONTINUOUS

Dan sits. He stares at the writing for a long, long time.

FADE OUT.

EXT. OVERLOOK HOTEL - NIGHT

The snow piled up. The hotel dark.

INT. OVERLOOK HOTEL, CORRIDORS - NIGHT
We FLOAT through the corridors. The sound of OLD-TIMEY MUSIC
coming from somewhere deep, deep within the rooms... echoing
through the halls, a ghost in its own right...
INT. OVERLOOK HOTEL, GOLD ROOM - NIGHT
We float into the ballroom. Toward the FAMILIAR BAR,
illuminated from below. No one in sight, but the MUSIC IS
COMING FROM HERE.
Come to rest in a CLOSEUP of A GLASS OF WHISKEY.

INT. AA MEETING - MORNING

CLOSE on an EIGHT-YEAR CHIP... in DAN’S HANDS. Eight years
older now (late 30's), CLEAR-EYED and sober. Around him,
people CLAP as he takes his chip. He turns to face the room.

Legend: 2008

DAN
Dan, alcoholic.

GROUP
Hi Dan.

From the chairs, Billy cups his hands to his mouth.

BILLY
Speech!

DAN
I’m not a speech guy, so I figured
I'd hold the chip and talk about
whatever popped up. So here I am,
and... I’m thinking about my dad. I
saw a chip like this in his hand,
couple of months before he died. 5-
month chip, I’m pretty sure. He
hurt me once, when he was drunk,
broke my arm, then he dried right
out.

He looks at the chip, and then at the group.

DAN (CONT'D)
He died when I was 5, so the only
way I ever got to know my dad,
really know him, was when I went
dark. When I drank, to dull the...
or every time I wanted to break
someone's face. The drinking and
the temper. Those things in me,
they were his and they were all I
could know of him.

(beat)

But now... now I get to know hima
little different. Cause he also
stood in a room like this once,
wanting to get well. For me. And my
mom. He held a chip in his hand, a
chip that said 5 months and on that
day, anyway, before the hotel...

Dan collects himself.
40.

DAN (CONT'D)
On that day, all he wanted in the
world was to stand where I’m
standing right now. And here I am.
(beat)
So thank you, I guess, from us
both. This is for Jack Torrance.

He takes the chip, returning to his seat. Billy puts a hand
on his shoulder as the next person stands.

INT. CHARLIE’S ROOM, RIVINGTON HOUSE - NIGHT

CHARLIE (90's), stirs in his bed. Soft lamplight beside him
as he looks through wrinkled eyelids...

TO THE CAT, sitting calmly at the foot of his bed. He stares
at it, sighing. Then turns to the chair beside him, where Dan
sits. He smiles at Charlie in the warm lamplight.

There’s something different in Dan’s demeanor... he is
COMFORTABLE in this role now. Used to it. It’s WHO HE IS.

DAN
Hi Charlie.

CHARLIE
Doc.
(beat)
I guess I don’t need to ask why
you're here, this hour.

DAN
Any pain? I can get Claudette to
bring you a pill.

CHARLIE
Pill won't matter. I’ve heard about
these house calls. What a visit
from Doctor Sleep really is. So
what do you see?

Dan puts his hand on the man’s forehead, gentle and calm.

DAN
Your twin sons at four. See them?

CHARLIE
(beat)
I do... I can actually see them...
41.

DAN
A Farmall tractor with a striped
umbrella over the seat. Five years
old, pulling a red wagon --

CHARLIE

Lord, look at that -- like a deck
of cards, all out of order...

(beat)
I’m not scared of hell, Doc. I
lived a decent life. And I don’t
think there’s such a place anyway.
I guess I’m scared there’s nothing.
There was nothing before, so what
if there’s nothing after...

DAN
We don’t end, Charlie. I know that
for certain. Don’t know much else,
but I know we don’t end.

CHARLIE
I can taste blueberries, the
blueberries my mother used to
grow... you taste those?

DAN
I do. And I hear Frank, singing on
the old radio, on your workbench,
by your tools...

(singing)
Come fly with me, come fly, let’s
fly away...

Charlie smiles, a tear rolling down his cheek.
DAN AND CHARLIE
If you can use some exotic booze,
there's a bar in far Bombay...
Come fly with me, let's fly, let's
fly away...

CUT TO:

INT. DAN'S ROOM, ELLIOT STREET - MORNING

Dan steps into his room, peeling off the work day. He turns
toward the blackboard, pausing as he sees a message in chalk:

Been a minute, little pen pal...
42.

He walks to the board. Writes a single word in response:

SCHOOL

INT. ABRA'S HOUSE, ABRA'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

We see ABRA (13 now, the same brightness in her eyes). She
smiles. Rolling her eyes a little.

LUCY (0.S.)
Abra! School!

ABRA
Fine, I know.

She pops headphones in as she grabs her backpack, checking
herself in the mirror. Then, she’s off into the world.

GRAMPA FLICK
Watchtower.

He looks at him as he passes. Grampa Flick looks ILL... his
hair almost white. Skin pale. Older than we saw him last...

He finds Rose SITTING ON TOP OF HER CAMPER, hat perched on
her head. Indian style. Looking out at the trees.

CROW
Sorry to interrupt.
ROSE
Any luck?
CROW

Getting closer. We’re heading in

the right direction. I just need

another day or two. I’1l find him.
(beat)

But til I do, you gotta open a

canister.
43.

ROSE
We took steam six months ago. Six
months, that’s nothing.

CROW
Yeah, but Rosie - that kid in
Delaware wasn’t so steamy, and it’s
already showing. You've seen Grampa
Flick’s hair, yeah?

ROSE
(beat)
Yeah.

CROW
I don’t think he’s well.

ROSE
Grampa Flick hasn’t been well since
Nixon was in office.

CROW
I know. But lately... anyway, we
need to eat. All of us. Are the
canisters low?

ROSE
Course not. Just no need to waste
one, if you’re close to the kid.

CROW
I might need it just to find him.
(beat)
Used to be more steam in the world.

ROSE
Don’t be daft. That’s like when
Rubes say “fifty years ago, people
used to be more neighborly.”

CROW
But it’s true, Rose. There’s less
steam out there, and weaker, too. I
don’t know if it’s their cell
phones or their diets or their
Netflix or what, but I’m not
picking up many scents these days,
and the ones I do -

ROSE
I‘1l open a canister tonight. Just
to tide everyone over.

He nods. Relieved. Heads back toward the ladder.
44,

CROW
You know it, Rose.

ROSE
Know what?

CROW
That's why you sit up here, every
day. That’s why you’re always up
here, no matter what you tell the
others. World’s not as steamy, and
you're looking for a whale.

Rose watches him go. And looks out at the trees.

INT. ROSE'S RV, IOWA - THAT NIGHT

Rose looks at the COLLECTION OF SILVER CANISTERS. She sighs.
There’s only a FEW LEFT. She picks up a canister, and turns
it over in her hands.

EXT. ROSE'S RV, IOWA - LATER

The True Knot have gathered around the campfire. Rose stands
at the center, looking out at the HUNGRY FACES of the group.
They stare GREEDILY at the canister in her hand.

She crouches down, OPENING THE VALVE. A HISS, and the SILVER
MIST leaks out. Spreading out like an UMBRELLA OVER HER.

ROSE
Take nourishment, and endure.

They gather around, descending on the mist, SLURPING IT IN.
As they do, we watch THEIR SKIN changing, becoming
TRANSLUCENT, the GRINNING SKULLS WITHIN visible as Rose steps
back, watching. Frowning.

CUT TO:

EXT. BASEBALL FIELD, IOWA - ANOTHER DAY

Kids playing baseball. Neighborhood uniforms, a boys and
girls club. We’re watching the game, nothing unusual... and
then we see BRADLEY TREVOR (12) step to the plate.

ON THE BLEACHERS: parents and kids watch on. One of the
SPECTATORS leans to the man next to him.
45.

SPECTATOR
Watch this kid - number 19. He’s a
natural. Hits it every time. Like
he can read the pitcher’s mind.

REVEAL CROW sitting behind them. WATCHING INTENTLY.

At the plate, Brad smiles just as the pitch is thrown... AND
SENDS THE BALL SCREAMING over the shortstop’s head. The crowd
CHEERS, and Crow smiles.

SPECTATOR (CONT’D)
See? You watch, one of these days
some talent scout’s gonna get wind
of Brad, there. You watch.

Behind him, Crow just smiles. He already has.

EXT. SECLUDED ROAD - DAY

Brad walks along the road, LONG ROWS OF CORN on either side
of him. Still in his uniform, carrying his bag and his glove.
Walking home, smiling.

Behind him, we realize a VEHICLE IS APPROACHING from the
distance. A VAN. It slows behind him, and he STEPS TO THE
SIDE of the road to let it pass. It pulls up beside him.
Barry leans out of the passenger window.
BARRY
Hey! 19! Just saw your game, you’re
ready for the majors! Well played!
BRAD
(wary)
Thanks.
BARRY
You heading home? Hop in, I'll give
you a ride.

Brad keeps walking, the van keeping pace.

BRAD
It’s real close, I’m good.

The sliding door opens, and Snakebite Andi leans out.

ANDI
It’s okay.

Brad STOPS walking. Staring at her.
46.

ANDI (CONT'D)
We're friends. You wanna hop in,
we'll take you right home.

BRAD
You can take me right home.

ANDI
You trust me.

BRAD
I trust you.

He climbs into the van, and the door closes behind him.
Driving calmly away, past the rows of corn.

CUT TO:

EXT. ABANDONED ETHANOL PLANT, IOWA - LATER THAT NIGHT

The vehicles of the True Knot are parked at the old plant.
Nothing around them for miles. They all watch on as Barry
gently lays Brad in the center of the circle. He’s bound with
DUCT TAPE, and he’s WEEPING.

BRAD
Please take me home... I won’t
tell. I won’t tell. Please...
Barry PICKS UP THE GLOVE. Number 19 carved into the leather.

BARRY
Number 19. Kid, you were good.

Barry PUTS HIS HAND into the glove, TRYING IT ON as Rose
drops to one knee beside Brad. Touching his hair.

ROSE
It’s not personal.

Rose steps away from him, looking out at the others with a
smile on her face. She steps toward Andi, who watches as Crow
hands rose a SMALL KNIFE. Short, but VERY SHARP.

She starts walking back toward Brad, who notices the knife.

BRAD
Are you going to hurt me?

ROSE
Yes.
47.

As the group tightens their circle around him, they hold
flashlights so that Rose can sees what she’s doing.

ROSE (CONT'D)
Pain purifies steam, dear boy.
Fear, too. So you understand.

And just like that, she brings the knife to his torso. We
STAY ON BRAD’S FACE as his eyes go wide, and we hear a faint
SLICING SOUND. He SCREAMS, LOUD. SO LOUD.

Rose sits back, looking at his mouth and nose. Frowning, she
reaches down and GOES BACK TO WORK, her hand moving off-
screen as Brad’s scream becomes GUTTURAL. PRIMAL.

And then, as his scream of PURE AGONY starts to cease -

A TINY CLOUD, SO SMALL, OF SILVER STEAM RISES FROM HIS LIPS.
Around him, the members of the True Knot GREEDILY LEAN
FORWARD, THEIR FACES STARING DOWN AND BLOCKING OUT THE SKY --
AS THEY INHALE.

ROSE (CONT'D)
Good. Good start.

Brad pants. Eyes wide with shock and pain. His eyes travel
down, to where Rose clutches the BLOODY KNIFE.

BRAD
Please -

ROSE
We're just getting started.
INT. ABRA'S HOUSE, ABRA'S ROOM - NIGHT

Abra is ASLEEP IN BED as we PUSH INTO A CLOSEUP. Her brow
furrows. She’s having A BAD DREAM.

ABRA
(asleep)
No... no...

EXT. ABANDONED ETHANOL PLANT - LATER THAT NIGHT
Brad's SCREAMS CONTINUE, becoming harsh BARKS of pain. Almost

inhuman. His eyes are wild, BLOOD SPRAYING up onto his chin
and cheeks from Rose’s work below.
48.

Another small CLOUD OF STEAM rises, and again the True Knot
LEAN DOWNWARD, almost like a football huddle, BREATHING
GREEDILY as the steam spreads among them --

THEIR SKIN BECOMING TRANSLUCENT, JUST FOR MOMENTS, REVEALING
GRINNING SKULLS AND GLITTERING EYES --

BRAD SCREAMS AGAIN underneath them, but it is pointless.

INT. ABRA'S HOUSE, ABRA'S ROOM - LATER

Abra BURSTS UP in her bed, HYPERVENTILATING. Panicking.
Trying to shake the dream.

ABRA
Stop... stop... stop...

She shakes her head, FREAKING OUT. Squints her eyes,
CONCENTRATING HARD -- SEEING FLASHES OF --

A KNIFE IN A BLOOD-SOAKED HAND, OVER A BASEBALL JERSEY.
BRAD’S SCREAMING FACE. THE TRANSLUCENT, GRINNING SKULL/FACES
OF THE MONSTERS LEANING OVER HIM, EYES SPARKLING WITH GREED --

And a WOMAN, IN A TOP HAT. WHO SLOWLY TURNS TO LOOK AT HER --

EXT. ABANDONED ETHANOL PLANT — CONTINUOUS

Rose suddenly STOPS HER WORK. Looks over her shoulder. As if
AWARE SOMEONE IS WATCHING HER... Crow notices her expression.

CROW
(quietly)
What is it?

Rose just looks up at him. Brad STARES at the sky. Tears and
blood all over his face.

BRAD
(weak)
Just kill me...

ROSE
Soon, dear.

And then, her hands go back to work, and again, his BARKS OF
AGONY fill the night as the Knot huddles around him, greedily
waiting for the next morsel of food to rise from his mouth.
49,

INT. ABRA'S HOUSE, ABRA'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Abra starts SCREAMING HER HEAD OFF. THRASHING ON THE BED.
SCREAMING LIKE BRAD is screaming, so many miles away. The
lights TURN ON, and David and Lucy RUN IN, TERRIFIED.

LUCY
Abra! Abra!
ABRA
TONY!!!! TONY!!! STOP THEM, TONY!!!

INT. DAN'S ROOM, ELLIOT STREET - NIGHT

Dan is asleep in his own bed, when A BLAST, A SHOCKWAVE,
FOLLOWED BY A LOUD CRACKING SOUND as Dan HITS THE FLOOR,
HARD. GRABBING HIS HEAD, in PAIN.

EXT. ABANDONED ETHANOL PLANT - CONTINUOUS

Rose SPINS WILDLY over her shoulder. She FELT IT TOO.

INT. DAN'S ROOM, ELLIOT STREET - CONTINUOUS
Dan struggles to his feet.

DAN
Jesus!

He stands, not even noticing that his NOSE IS BLEEDING. His
eyes go to the mirror on the wall by his headboard --

WHERE SOMETHING TAKES HIS BREATH AWAY.

He stares. All his breath stopped in his head. In the mirror,
he can see the CHALKBOARD WALL reflected...

A WORD CRACKED INTO THE VERY PLASTER, LARGE AND BOLD.
REDRUM

He stares at it, and slowly turns away from the glass, toward
the wall, where the word MURDER stares down at him.

He walks to it, very slowly.

DAN (CONT'D)
Okay. Okay.

SCARED, he picks up the chalk. And writes one word back:
50.

WHO?

He slowly turns, walking back to the bed. Shaking, he sits
down, and makes himself look back at the wall, where the
answer has already appeared in chalk.

BASEBALL BOY.

EXT. ABANDONED ETHANOL PLANT - LATER
Brad stares ahead as his body finally GIVES OUT. A long DEATH
RATTLE from his throat, and the Knot lean closer, GETTING THE
LAST OF THE STEAM as it rises from his mouth. Sucking it in.
Rose sits back.
ROSE
Damn, I thought he had another few
minutes in him.
CROW
He made it three hours, we can’t
complain.
She picks up a silver canister.
She looks up to Grampa Flick... WHOSE HAIR IS A LIGHT BROWN
AGAIN, the silver long gone. His wrinkles seem BETTER,
smoother. He looks TEN YEARS YOUNGER, EASY.
As they disperse, Rose PRESSES ON THE BOY’S CHEST, looking
for little traces of steam that might be hiding inside. She
holds the canister, and the steam rises.
INT. ABRA'S HOUSE, ABRA'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Abra rocks back and forth, sobbing as her parents hold her.
ABRA
They killed him. They killed him...
INT. DAN'S ROOM, ELLIOT STREET - CONTINUOUS

Dan sits on the bed, looking at the word on his wall. Pale,
scared. Over his shoulder, that familiar word in the mirror:

REDRUM

DISSOLVE TO:
51.

EXT. ABANDONED ETHANOL PLANT - SUNRISE

Rose and Crow finish BURYING THE BODY in the dirt, as the
morning sun creeps up. The others are inside their vehicles,
resting, ready to go.

She shovels a heap of dirt onto the growing pile. Almost
done. She sits back, resting her head on the handle of the
shovel. And after a long beat...

ROSE
We had a looker.

Crow stops. Turns to her, slowly.

CROW
Tonight?

ROSE
Yeah.

CROW
Big steam?

ROSE
Huge. Huge.

CROW
Where?

ROSE

East Coast I think.

CROW
(beat)
You're saying someone looked in
from fifteen hundred miles away?

ROSE
Maybe further.

CROW
Boy or girl?

ROSE
Think it was a girl, but she was
out of there in a flash but then
she screamed, and I swear, Crow
Daddy... I haven’t felt power like
that, raw power like that, in so
long...
52.

CROW
We should look into it. Sooner than
later, I guess. In case her parents
freak out, send her to a
psychiatrist, they get her on pills
-- could ruin the steam, muffle her
just when we need --

ROSE

If I got it right, and I’m pretty
sure I did, giving Paxil to this
kid would be like throwing a piece
of Saran Wrap over a searchlight.

(beat)
I don’t know where she is, but I do
think she’ll come back. And when
she does, I’ll know a lot more. A
lot more.

They go back to burying the little baseball boy.

CUT TO:

INT. DAN'S ROOM, ELLIOT STREET - MORNING

Dan finishes getting dressed, ready to head out for his day.
He stops, though, staring at the wall. He’s going to have to
clean that up at some point...

He ERASES the chalk that’s there, running his fingers over
the cracks in the plaster. Before he goes, he reaches down,
holding a piece of chalk. CONSIDERING.

Finally, writing. As he heads for the door, we REVEAL the
words he wrote:

I hope you’re okay. Your friend, Dan.

INT. ABRA'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - LATER THAT MORNING

Abra bounds into the kitchen, where Lucy sits at the table.
Sipping coffee... watching her daughter CAREFULLY.

ABRA
Morning!

She watches as Abra heads to the fridge, grabbing some stuff.
ABRA (CONT'D)

Guess what! I made a new friend,
his name’s Dan.
53.

LUCY
At school?

ABRA
(thinks fast)
No, he doesn’t live here. I mean he
lives close, Frazier I think. No

big deal.

LUCY
(beat)

Are you okay? Last night --
ABRA

I’m okay. I’m sorry about that.
LUCY

Just a nightmare, huh? Abra... I

know that head of yours is like a
radio sometimes, and you pick up

some... weird stations --
ABRA
I told you, I don’t -- nothing

weird like that, not anymore --
LUCY

I only need to know you’re okay.

You're safe, right? You’re okay?

ABRA
Of course, mom. I’m gonna be late.

She bounds out of the kitchen. Lucy watches, frowning.

INT. SCHOOL LIBRARY - DAY

Abra sits at one of the LIBRARY COMPUTERS, headphones in her
ears. Around her, other kids form small pockets, talking and
living their normal lives. But Abra is on the outside.

Abra takes off her headphones, looking around the room. We
realize why she prefers the music -- SHE CAN HEAR THEIR
THOUGHTS. We catch SNIPPETS as she scans the room:

My god I’ve gotta study if I don’t study I don’t know...

Fifty two, running play -- handoff to eleven and -- coach is
gonna kill me if I don’t get these, c’mon...

Why doesn’t he like me? My hair? I should change my hair...
54.

She looks at the other kids, trying not to notice the
OCCASIONAL STARE. As she stares at one girl, she hears --

GIRL (V.0O.)
The freak is staring at me again...
what is she staring at, freak...

Abra quickly turns away. Pulls the headphones up, the chorus
of thought-whispers is drowned out. She turns back to the
computer... looking at the NATIONAL CENTER FOR EXPLOITED AND
MISSING CHILDREN. She scrolls through LISTINGS, the faces of
the nation’s missing children. So, so many...

INT. ABRA'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - EVENING

Abra comes in the door. David sits at the table, doing some
work on his laptop.

DAVID
Hey Abba-doo.

ABRA
Hey dad.

DAVID

School okay?

ABRA
How’s the book?

DAVID
Good! I’m writing about Charleston
and the Black Bottom -

She opens the fridge, grabbing a soda.

ABRA
I’m gonna start my homework.

He watches her go.

DAVID
That's good sweetie, think Harvard
in three years!

ABRA
(laughs )
We'll see.
55.

INT. ABRA'S HOUSE, ABRA'S ROOM - NIGHT

Abra sits on her bed, music playing in her ears. Her books
are laid out on the bed around her, but she isn’t studying.
She’s looking at the PRINTOUT she took home from the library.
The printout of the MISSING PERSON’S REPORT:

BRADLEY TREVOR. AGE: 12. RACE: CAUCASIAN. LOCATION:
BANKERTON, IOWA.

ABRA
You were special. Like me...

She holds onto the picture, laying down on her back. Getting
comfortable. Reaches out, TOUCHING THE PICTURE. And after a
few moments, closes her eyes...

A FLASH: Bradley, TIED UP, on the FLOOR OF A VEHICLE --
Abra OPENS her eyes. Startled. Wasn’t expecting that. She
looks down at the picture again, and brings her fingers back
to the image. Touches it. Closes her eyes again --

FLASHES OF: CORN FIELDS, rolling by. The RUMBLING of the VAN
beneath her -- A BASEBALL GLOVE ON THE FLOOR OF THE VAN --

She opens her eyes. Takes a deep breath. Lays completely
back, holding the picture, squeezing her eyes closed...

HER EYES FLY OPEN. COMPLETELY WHITE, ROLLED INTO HER HEAD...

FLASHES OF: A BASEBALL FIELD, CORN FIELDS, A LONG ROAD --

EXT. ABANDONED ETHANOL PLANT - NIGHT

A BIRDS’ EYE VIEW of the abandoned plant. The LINE OF
VEHICLES moving through the dark, NO HEADLIGHTS. RV's,
CAMPERS, A VAN...

Pulling past the sign: NO TRESPASSING BY ORDER OF THE CANTON
COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEPT. ANOTHER SIGN BEYOND IT...

INT. ABRA'S HOUSE, ABRA'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Abra CONVULSES SLIGHTLY on the bed, eyes rolled over white.
SHE GRIPS A PEN, scribbling on the printout without looking:

“ORGANIC INDUSTRIES. ETHANOL PLANT #4. CLOSED UNTIL --
56.

EXT. ABANDONED ETHANOL PLANT - NIGHT

-- FURTHER NOTICE,” reads the sign that Abra is transcribing.
The images come in a FLURRY NOW: BRADLEY SCREAMING -- DIRT
SHOVELED INTO A HOLE ONTO A BASEBALL GLOVE -- THE CARAVAN
LEAVING IN THE MORNING LIGHT --

INT. ABRA'S HOUSE, ABRA'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Abra GASPS in a breath as her eyes go back to normal. She
stands, shaking it off. Tears in her eyes.

She heads to the window, looking out at her street, and the
MOUNTAINS in the distance. And we can tell... SHE’S ANGRY.
She GRIPS the window, knuckles turning white. And as she
stares at her street, her eyes ROLL BACK AGAIN --

And the room PIVOTS. ROLLING UPWARD, as though the whole
house is ROTATING TOWARD THE SKY --

ABRA HOLDS ONTO THE WINDOW AS THE ROOM ROLLS AROUND HER, hair
falling back behind her like she’s hanging from the ceiling.
When she opens her eyes, she’s not home anymore. She’s in --

INT. SUPERMARKET - EVENING

-- a supermarket. Just a normal supermarket. Lit by
fluorescent lights, SHOPPERS milling about. Abra is FLOATING
FORWARD down an aisle, and she looks down to see --

HANDS, HOLDING A SHOPPING CART. Not her own hands, though...
the hands of a WOMAN.

Reveal ROSE, pushing the cart, loaded with basics. As she
goes, she SLOWS down. A strange look on her face. She looks
around, trying to shake the odd feeling she has.

She starts pushing the cart again. Turning a corner, looking
out at the ICE CREAM in the freezer. She reaches up, as
though to open the freezer doors --

But RESTS HER HANDS on them. EXACTLY THE SAME WAY ABRA WAS
HOLDING HER WINDOW. Rose CLOSES HER EYES, and sees a FLASH -

OF ABRA’S STREET, WITH THE MOUNTAINS BEYOND.

ROSE
Well hi there.

In the reflection of the glass freezer doors, Rose can ALMOST
SEE ABRA'S FACE, looking back at her. Rose reaches up and
back to TOUCH THE BACK OF HER HEAD.
57.

INT. ABRA'S HOUSE, ABRA'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Abra STARES out her window, eyes rolled over white, when A
HAND GENTLY RESTS ON THE BACK OF HER HEAD -- ABRA SCREAMS.

ABRA
Get out!
INT. SUPERMARKET - CONTINUOUS
Rose is KNOCKED BACKWARD as the glass of the freezer door
SHATTERS BEFORE HER, bottles and containers EXPLODING within.
She hits the ground, SHOCKED. BLOOD RUNNING FROM HER NOSE.
INT. ABRA'S HOUSE, ABRA'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Abra backs away from the window, eyes wide with fear and
defiance. Breathing heavy, she SHUTS HER EYES AND SHOUTS --

ABRA
GET OUT OF MY HEAD!! DAN, HELP --

RUMBLE - the whole room SHAKES ON ITS FOUNDATION.

INT. ABRA'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

David LOOKS UP as the house VIOLENTLY SHAKES, the light above
him SWINGING as though from a powerful EARTHQUAKE.

INT. SUPERMARKET - CONTINUOUS

Rose TAKES ANOTHER BLAST, KICKING at the shopping cart as she

SKIDS across the floor. Sits up, looking wildly around as a
CLERK rushes to her, to help her to her feet.

CLERK
Ma’‘am... you okay?
ROSE
I’m fine... Jesus. Jesus.

She WIPES the blood from her nose, STUNNED.

INT. AA MEETING - NIGHT

Dan lays on the ground in front of the coffee pot. BLOOD
RUNNING FROM HIS NOSE as well. Unconscious. Billy helps lift
him up as Dan looks around, disoriented.
58.
BILLY
You okay, Danno?

DAN
Yeah... what happened?

BILLY
You just dropped. I thought you was
having a stroke...
Dan gets to his feet. Wipes the blood from his nose.

BILLY (CONT'D)
Who’s Tony?

Dan looks at him. Surprised.
BILLY (CONT'D)
You kept saying “Please Tony,
help.”

DAN
Sorry about that. I’m good.

CUT TO:

EXT. CAMPSITE - NIGHT
Rose steps out of her truck, heading toward the camp. The
others mill about, but Crow can tell right away something is
wrong. THE BLOOD, on her face and her shirt.
CROW
Rosie?

INT. ROSE'S RV - MOMENTS LATER

She shuts the door, pulling off her bloody shirt.

ROSE
We've got a problem.
CROW
Talk to me.
ROSE

The looker? She found me again. I’m
minding my own business, buyin’
groceries, and there she was.
59.

CROW
(beat)
How?

ROSE
Don’t know, don’t care. We have to
have her, Crow, we have to.

CROW
Does she... does she know who you
are? Where we are?

ROSE
I don’t know. I don’t think so, but
that’s not the important... I said

she was huge steam, right? Well
it’s even bigger than that. I tried
to turn around on her and she blew
me out of her like I was nothing.

CROW
Bullshit.

ROSE
Never happened to me. Never. I
would have said it was impossible.

Crow takes this in. Rose smiles at him... she’s excited.

CROW
Is she food, or do we turn her?

ROSE
We don’t turn her.

CROW
You sure? If she’s what you say --

ROSE
Then we don’t want anyone with that
kind of power in the Knot. Think
about it.
(beat)
What if it’s neither.

CROW
What do you mean?

ROSE
I mean we don’t kill her, we don’t
turn her. Think of a cow. You
butcher one, gives you meat for
months. Keep it alive, take care of
it, it gives you milk for years.
(MORE )
60.

ROSE (CONT'D)
And she can take it, Crow. She’1l
last a long, long time.

CROW

We've never tried that.
ROSE

I know.
CROW

Because a steam-head’s dangerous.
You keep it alive, it could be
dangerous.

ROSE
I know. The point... the point is
she’s a great, white whale. And I
want her, Crow. I want her.

CUT TO:

EXT. SCHOOL - ANOTHER DAY

Abra gets out of her mother’s car, backpack over her
shoulder. She heads toward the school.

LUCY
Have a good day, sweetheart!

ABRA
Thanks mom!

She watches her mom drive away... and once she knows she’s
gone, she starts walking AWAY FROM THE SCHOOL, up the street.
EXT. BUS STATION - LATER

Abra approaches the ticket counter at the bus station.

EXT. BUS STATION, FRAZIER NH - LATE MORNING

Abra steps off the bus. Looking around the main street of
Frazier... closing her eyes. FEELING FOR SOMETHING. She
walks, head down. Listening to her music. And then sees
something that strikes a chord with her... TEENEYTOWN.
61.

EXT. TEENEYTOWN, FRASIER NH - MOMENTS LATER

Dan sits at the controls, STARTING THE SMALL TRAIN. Aboard,
dozens of HAPPY KIDS enjoy the train ride. He sits back,
content. Smiling at them.

And then... his SMILE FADES. SENSING SOMETHING.

He turns around... seeing ABRA, standing a few feet away.
SMILING AT HIM. He nods, turning back to the train... but
looks back, and she’s still smiling.

And then, a VOICE IN HIS HEAD.

ABRA (V.O.)
Hi.
Dan goes PALE. Looks around... how did she find him?
DAN (V.O.)

Not here. Gimme a sec.
Abra nods. Dan heads to Billy.
DAN
Hey, you okay if I take lunch
early? Not feeling so hot.

BILLY
Sure.

He watches as Dan walks away, through Teeneytown. Some
teenager following him, at a bit of a distance...

CUT TO:

EXT. LIBRARY BENCH, MAIN STREET, FRAZIER - LATER

Dan and Abra sit on the bench outside the public library.
Abra watches him, EAGER. EXCITED.

ABRA (V.O.)
You can hear me --
DAN
(out loud)

Let's use our outside voices, ok?
You tracked me down.

ABRA
It was easier than I thought! Like
GPS, but in my head --
62.

DAN
Listen, and I don’t mean any
offense, but this day and age, a
man sitting alone with a teenage
girl on a bench --

ABRA
I’m Abra Rafaella Stone. And you’re
my uncle. Uncle Dan. And that’s not
even a lie, not totally. In science
last year, Mr. Staley told us that
all humans share the same genetic
plan. He said that the things that
make us different are very small
things. Did you know that we share
something like ninety-nine percent
of our genetic makeup with dogs? So
you could be my Uncle. Or cousin,
or whatever. That’s all I’m saying.

DAN
Abra’s Theory of Relativity.

ABRA
We're related in other ways. You're
magic, like me.

She looks at him, eager. Dan sighs. Reluctant.

DAN
Don’t know about magic. I... I
always called it the Shining. And
yeah, we both Shine.
(beat)
Do your parents know?

ABRA
About my “Shine”? My dad’s always
been a little more scared of it,
but he thinks it’s gone except for
a few things, like me calling from
camp because I knew Momo was sick,
and he’s glad. My mom’s a little
different. Sometimes she’ll ask me
to help her find something she’s
lost -- last month it was her car
keys, she left them on Dad's
worktable in the garage -- but she
doesn’t know how much is still
there. They don’t talk about it. I
know it scares them so I try not
to. Because if people find out...
Eek, a freak. You know?

(off his face)
(MORE )
63.

ABRA (CONT'D)
Sure you know. You try not to use
it, don't you.
(realizing)
You've been trying a long time.

DAN
When I was a kid, I didn’t
understand the Shining, so I called
it Tony... I thought he was my
imaginary friend.

ABRA
I thought you were my imaginary
friend. For a long time.
(beat)
How many of us are out there?

DAN

Lot of folks have a little bit of
Shine to them. They don’t even know
it. But they always seem to show up
with flowers when their wives are
sad, they do good on school tests
they don’t even study for, they
sense how people are feeling as
soon as they walk into a room. But
I’ve only met two or three people
in my life that knew they Shined.

ABRA
The baseball boy Shined. His name
was Bradley Trevor.

She reaches into her bag, handing Dan the printout. Pictures
of Bradley Trevor, and OTHER MISSING KIDS.

ABRA (CONT'D)
These people - they look like
people, anyway - they took him and
they... ate him. They ate his
Shine.

DAN
You could feel it.

ABRA
And they could feel me. I think. At
least one of them, a lady. A lady
with a hat.

DAN
So what do you want to do?
64.

ABRA

I want to find them. Stop them.
Because I think they’ve done this
to a lot of other kids, too.

(beat)
I used to feel so alone. I thought
it was only me. You know how that
feels, don’t you.

DAN
I do.

ABRA
But we’re not alone. And those
other kids out there, they’re not
alone either but they think they
are, and they’re in danger. So I
have to do something. Right?

DAN
Why did you come here? Why me?

ABRA
(beat)
Because you can hear me. You’d
believe me. You Shine too. And they
hurt people like us. I mean what
would you do?

Dan shakes his head. This is too much...

ABRA (CONT'D)
If you could get something of his,
if you could go to Iowa -

DAN
Whoa, hang on.

ABRA
I can help you find him! Then his
parents would know where he was,
they can bury him right, at least,
but we could also get his glove. If
I could touch that glove, I could
track them --

DAN
Easy --

ABRA
Because Barry the Chunk, I think
that was his name, for a while,
before they killed him, he was
wearing it.
65.

Dan hands her the papers back. Sighs.

DAN

Go home, Abra. Go home, think about
school and your parents and the
rest of your life. Don’t chase
these people, don’t aggravate them,
and whatever you do, don’t attract
their attention. Don’t Shine. Find
something - anything - well, almost
anything - to stop that Shine of
yours. You keep your head down,
keep your Shine dull, and you hope
to god that these people - or
anything else like them - doesn’t
see you. Once they see you, they
come back. Do you hear me? They
come back.

(beat)
Keep your head down, and keep
yourself safe. Above all else.

He stands, leaving her on the bench as he walks away.

CUT TO:

INT. ORDERLY STATION, RIVINGTON HOUSE - NIGHT

Dan sits at the station, rooms dark around him. He smiles as
Azzie HOPS up onto the counter, meowing at him.

DAN
Hey Azzie.

The cat hops down, running to an OPEN DOOR. MEOWING.
DAN (CONT'D)
Wow, got your wires crossed
tonight. No one’s in there, Az.

The cat MEOWS louder, heading inside. Dan follows.

DAN (CONT'D)
I told you, that room’s empty --

As he turns the corner, he sees SOMEONE STANDING IN THE DARK
ROOM. LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW. Dan takes a step inside.
INT. PATIENT'S ROOM, RIVINGTON HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Dan steps toward the figure, as he does he CLOSES HIS EYES.
WE FLASH TO AN IMAGE OF A LARGE LOCK BOX, LID CREAKING OPEN --
66.

DICK
Whoa, hang on, Doc.

It’s DICK HALLORANN, barely visible in the moonlight.

DAN
Dick... I’m sorry, I thought...

DICK
Thought I was from the Overlook.
Almost locked me up. Still getting
visits from them old ghosts?

DAN
It’s been years. Horace Derwent was
the last one. Confetti on his suit.
Said “great party, isn’t it?” shit-—
eating grin on his face... ‘til I
pulled out a box for him. That grin
went fast.

(beat)
You know it never occurred to me to
ask, those years ago... what

happens to them in these boxes? Do
they die in there?

DICK
Do you care?

DAN
(beat)
I’ve missed you.

DICK
Has it been a long time? Can’t
tell. This world is a dream of a
dream to me now.

DAN
Eight years. Little more.

DICK
Last time I saw you, you was at the
bottom. You look better now.

DAN
Why are you here?

DICK
I’m here because it all comes
‘round. Ka’s a wheel, Doc.

DAN
Abra.
67.

DICK
You listen, son, it hurts to be
here so I'll only say it once. If
these empty devils ever found you,
when you was a tyke - if they’d
even sniffed you - you'd be long
dead. They’re on the land like a
cancer on the skin. Once, they rode
camels in the desert; once they
drove caravans ‘cross Eastern
Europe. They eat screams and drink
pain and they've noticed that
little girl.

Dick approaches. Eyes grave.

DICK (CONT'D)

They might kill her. Might turn
her. Or might keep her til she’s
all used up and that’d be worst of
all. You can’t let ‘em.

DAN
Why me?

DICK
Because she found you. Because she
showed up. Hell doc, why me? You
just walked on into my kitchen one
day, and I’m still on the hook.
Some things just are.

DAN
What the hell am I supposed to do?

DICK
Get her what she asked for.

Dick turns back, heading back toward the window. Looking out
at the mountains in the moonlight.

DICK (CONT'D)
You won’t see me again, Doc. This
is my last dream. It seems to me
you grew up fine, son. But you
still owe a debt.

(beat)
Pay it.

And then the room is empty.

CUT TO:
68.

INT. ROSE'S RV - AFTERNOON

Rose sits in her camper. Eyes closed. Perfectly still when
there is a KNOCK AT HER DOOR. She ignores it. Another knock.

ROSE
Goddammit, what!

The door opens. Crow leans inside.

CROW
I’m sorry to interrupt you -

ROSE
I told you, no distractions!
Nothing to eat, nothing to drink,
just peace, quiet and meditation, I
need all my wits for her tonight -

CROW
That’s why I’m here. Found
something.

He approaches, holding out a newspaper clipping. Rose takes
it from him: “POCKET EARTHQUAKE” REPORTED IN ANNISTON.

ROSE

(reading)
“How small can an earthquake be?
Pretty small, if the people of
Richland Court, a short Anniston
street that dead-ends at the Saco
River, are to be believed. Late
Tuesday night, several residents of
the street reported a tremor that
rattled windows, shook floors, and
sent glassware tumbling from
shelves. Although the Geological
Survey Center in Wrentham reports
there were no temblors in New
England last Tuesday” - well I’11l
be. Maybe, just maybe...

CROW
What do you think?

ROSE
I think maybe. Not 100%, but I’1l
take 50/50.

CROW
If it’s actually her -
69.

ROSE
Richland Court -

CROW
- and she did that, shook a whole
street in New Hampshire -

ROSE
Having a place to focus on — not
just a town but a street — will
make things a hell of a lot easier
for me tonight. Good catch.

CROW
How you comin’ at her?

ROSE
She'll be asleep. I just want to
look around. See who she is. Pick
up information, plant suggestions
like worms. Let ‘em burrow. A
hundred worms, about her dear
friends the Knot. And when we roll
up she’ll be so glad to see us
she'll hop right in the van.

CROW
If she did that... if she really
shook the whole street, you should
be careful.

ROSE
(beat)
I should be careful. She’s a little
girl.
CROW

And you're the queen bitch of all
time, I know. I’m just sayin’.

He turns, leaving her to meditate.

CUT TO:

INT. ABRA’S HOUSE, ABRA’S ROOM - NIGHT

Abra sits on her bed, downtrodden. Headphones in her ears.
There’s a KNOCK at her door, and Lucy leans in.

LUCY
Hey...
70.

ABRA
Hey mom.

LUCY
Are you okay? We missed you at
dinner.

ABRA

I’m okay. Just a rough day.

LUCY
Wanna talk about it?

ABRA
I’m good.

Lucy nods. Knows better than to push her.
LUCY

I'm flying out to see Momo in the
morning, I‘’1ll be back as soon as I

can...
(hesitates)
Abra?
ABRA
Yeah?
LUCY
Is she... gonna pull through this

time? Is she gonna be okay?

Abra looks at her mother sadly.
ABRA

I don’t know, mom. I hope so. Tell

her I love her.
Lucy nods, and closes the door behind her. Abra sighs, turns
off the light, and then lays down. Closes her eyes, ready to
sleep. And dream.

CUT TO:

EXT. CAMPSITE - NIGHT

Rose sits atop her RV. Legs crossed in front of her, sitting
lotus. Hands resting gently on her knees, centering herself.
Getting ready. Above her, a sky full of stars.

She takes a deep breath. Concentrates...
71.

She briefly OPENS HER EYES, and we realize she is FLOATING
FAR ABOVE THE GROUND. Stars above her, LIGHTS BELOW HER...
the scattered lights of small towns, houses. Cars.

ROSE IS TRAVELING.

EXT. RICHLAND COURT - NIGHT

A normal cul-de-sac, quiet. The lights out. Rose STANDS by
the street sign: RICHLAND COURT. As she steps forward, toward
the houses --

THE STREET REVOLVES, AS IF FOLDING TOWARD HER. FOLDING IN
HALF, so that she is looking straight ahead at THE ROOFTOPS
OF THE HOUSES. Staring at each one...

NOTICING BLUE LIGHT coming from one house. AS IF IT IS
GLOWING SOFTLY. Rose moves toward the roof, and again the
WORLD TURNS, REVOLVING --

The house AND THE GROUND BENEATH IT now UPSIDE DOWN as Rose
walks, stars beneath her feet -- TOWARD ONE BEDROOM WINDOW.

She holds her hands up, pressing against the glass. Peering
inside... it is ABRA’S ROOM. DARK, save a BLUE GLOW from
within... Rose CLOSES HER EYES, concentrating further --

PUSHING THE WINDOW FORWARD, the house TIPPING FORWARD AGAIN,
so that she is on top of the window, PUSHING DOWN ON IT like
she’s doing a push-up -—

And then it FALLS AWAY, the glass DROPPING FROM THE WINDOW,
DOWN INTO THE ROOM -- AND SILENTLY EVAPORATING INTO THIN AIR.

The house REVOLVES AGAIN, Rose STEPPING FORWARD through the
open window as if it is a small door, and standing now, in --

INT. ABRA'S HOUSE, ABRA'S ROOM - NIGHT

-- Abra’s room. The room is dark, but above her THE CEILING
IS FULL OF STARS. Rose looks at the girl SLEEPING IN THE BED.
She can’t see her face, it’s buried in the pillow.

ROSE
(quietly)
Keep sleeping, princess.

She steps quietly, looking at the WALLS of the room... and we
realize the walls aren’t walls at all. They’re FILE DRAWERS.
MEMORIES. Some labeled: “Mom.” “Dad.” “Dreams.” “School.”
72.

ROSE (CONT'D)
You rubes. Spend your whole lives
making little boxes, little
memories, and you think they make
you so rich... you should see mine,
kiddo. My mind’s a cathedral.

She runs her hands over the file drawers that make up the
walls, looking for something interesting. She sees one,
decorated in a child’s handwriting...

ROSE (CONT'D)
Well hi there.

The drawer, larger than the others, is labeled “ME.”

Rose GLANCES BACK at the bed, where Abra’s still sleeping.
She smiles. She reaches up, pulling open the drawer. It
EXTENDS FROM THE WALL, coming out about a foot. Rose peers
inside, at the FILE FOLDERS packing the drawer...

She reaches her hand inside to pull one out.

SUDDENLY, A HORRIBLE NOISE PIERCES THE AIR. A BRIGHT
SPOTLIGHT SHINES DOWN RIGHT IN HER EYES -- THE DRAWER SLAMS
SHUT ON ROSE’S HAND - CRUSHING BONES, SNAPPING FINGERS -

Rose SCREAMS in SHOCK and surprise. YANKING AT HER HAND, but
it is CAUGHT, like in a BEAR TRAP. She turns, realizing that
ABRA IS SITTING UP...

BUT ABRA IS DIFFERENT. Her hair is SHOCK BLONDE, and she HAS
NO EYES. No identifying features... LIKE HER FACE HAS BEEN
CENSORED. The only thing we recognize of Abra IS HER SMILE.
DREAM ABRA
He said you’d come back, and you
did...
THE SMILE BECOMES A GRIN.

DREAM ABRA (CONT'D)
Good.

She STANDS from the bed, moving toward Rose. Rose FLAILS,
hand trapped, VULNERABLE AND STUNNED --

ROSE
Get back -- GET BACK!!

But “Abra” just GRINS at her. Advancing.

ROSE (CONT'D)
You're a fucking child!
73.
“Abra's” grin FALTERS for just a moment, but she REACHES UP,
HER HAND HEADING FOR ROSE’S HEAD --

ROSE (CONT'D)
NO --

AND ROSE IS SUDDENLY ALONE IN THE ROOM.

ALL OF THE FURNITURE IS GONE, a strange SLUDGE on the ground,
oozing up around her and HOLDING HER ON THE SPOT. A TRAP --

Suddenly, Rose is aware of a NOISE. Like PAPERS being rifled
through, very fast --

ROSE (CONT'D)

Where the hell did you...
(realizes)

NO.

She CLOSES her eyes, and for just a FLASH we see --

-- a CAVERNOUS SPACE, vast and dark, FULL OF FILE CABINET
DRAWERS -- ROSE’S MEMORIES, ROSE’S MIND -- AND A YOUNG GIRL
Is RIFLING THROUGH THEM --

-- Rose OPENS HER EYES, thrashing her head back and forth.

ROSE (CONT'D)
GET OUT! GET OUT! GET...

The sounds of PAPERS is deafening as Abra DIGS through Rose’s
mind. Desperate, Rose begins to TEAR HER HAND out of the
drawer that holds it. Her fingers SNAP, the skin PEELS BACK --

But she RIPS HER HAND from the vice, and STUMBLES toward the
window, holding her hand.

ROSE (CONT'D)
GET OUT!

The room ROTATES AGAIN, the window DROPPING DOWN, and Rose
stumbles, FALLING THROUGH THE OPENING --
EXT. RICHLAND COURT - CONTINUOUS

-- into the night, the world TURNING again, Rose FREE FALLING
TOWARD THE SKY, out of control --

THE WORLD TURNING BENEATH HER, AS THOUGH SHE’S SUDDENLY AT
35,000 FEET, the wind KNOCKING HER BACK AND FORTH, as the
ground suddenly RUSHES UP TOWARD HER --

She PLUMMETS, down toward an RV parked in a campsite --
74.

EXT. ROSE'S RV - CONTINUOUS

-- AND BACK INTO HER OWN BODY, laying flat on her back on top
of her camper -- as the world ROTATES VIOLENTLY TO THE SIDE,
sending her ROLLING toward the edge of the camper --

AND FALLING HARD ONTO THE GROUND BESIDE IT. She GASPS,
lifting her face from the DIRT. BLOOD running from her nose,
eyes wide. Crow RUSHES TOWARD HER, followed by Andi and
several other members of the True Knot.

CROW
Rose!
ROSE
(gasping)
Trap...

She tries to stand up, putting weight on her hand --

And HOWLS with pain. She slumps down, pulling her hand up to
her face to look at the damage -- BROKEN FINGERS. NAILS
PULLED OUT. DEEP GASHES in her skin -- it’s like her hand was
put through a SHREDDER.

ANDI
What the hell happened?!

ROSE
(gasping)
Little bitch set a trap for me.

ANDI
Your hand --

Rose SHOVES HER BACK. Furious. She SCREAMS into the night.

CROW
Rose --
She SPINS toward him, and we see -- HER EYES ARE DIFFERENT.
INHUMAN. Small POINTS OF LIGHT SHINE from her PUPILS,
subtle... but her feigned humanity is SLIPPING in her anger.

CROW (CONT'D)
Calm down. We know where she is
now, right? Now we know.

ROSE
She was in my head.

CROW
(blinks)
What?
75.

ROSE
Stealing! Stealing from me!

CROW
What does she know?

ROSE
I don’t know!

CROW
How much did she see?

ROSE
I don’t know!

She fumes. Paces. Clutching her damaged hand.
ROSE (CONT'D)
She's dead. That little thing
dared... fuck... with me...

BARRY interrupts.

BARRY
There’s a problem -
ROSE
Not now!
BARRY

Grampa Flick.
They turn and look at him.

BARRY (CONT'D)
I think he’s cycling.

CUT TO:

INT. DAN'S ROOM, ELLIOT STREET - NIGHT

Dan STIRS in his sleep, a VOICE IN HIS HEAD -- CRACKING, like
the FREQUENCY IS OFF, but BREAKING THROUGH --

ABRA (V.O.)
Uncle Dan! Uncle Dan! I hurt her, I
really hurt her!

He WINCES, sitting up. Disoriented.
76.

INT. ABRA'S HOUSE, ABRA'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Abra SITS in bed, in the dark. Eyes closed. SENDING HER
THOUGHTS. Whispering to herself...

ABRA
(whispering)
I hurt her and she deserved it and
that’s not the best part --

INT. DAN’S ROOM, ELLIOT STREET - CONTINUOUS

Dan holds his temples as he listens to her voice in his head,
distorted but clearly hers.

ABRA (V.O.)

-- the best part is I got in her
head. I got in her head. Uncle Dan?
Are you there? Can you hear me?

DAN
(to himself)
Oh god, Abra. What did you do...

Dan stands, heading toward the wall. The word MURDER, cracked
into the plaster. He picks up a piece of chalk, and after a
beat... writes “OKAY. WHERE?” And he STOPS.

DAN (CONT'D)

(to himself)
Just talk to the kid. If we’re
gonna do this, let’s do this.

He PUTS THE CHALK DOWN. Takes a beat... and closes his eyes.
DAN (CONT'D)
Hi Abra.
INT. ABRA'S HOUSE, ABRA'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

In her bed, Abra suddenly LIGHTS UP. Dan’s voice FILLING HER
HEAD, no distortion at all. Like he’s RIGHT THERE.

ABRA
I can hear you...

DAN (V.O.)

I’m sorry I sent you away, before.
Tell me everything. Then tell me
what I’ve got to do in Iowa.

CUT TO:
77.

EXT. CAMPSITE - NIGHT

The members of the True Knot gather around the campfire.
They've pulled GRAMPA FLICK out into a field, near the
firelight. They stare at him, faces pale and afraid.

He lays on the ground, COUGHING. FRAIL. He appears near
death. Crow crouches beside him. Rose is CRYING. Andi stands
beside her, confused.

ANDI

I don’t understand.
ROSE

You will.
ANDI

I thought we lived forever...

ROSE
Did someone promise you that, Andi?
Someone say you’re immortal? I said
“live long, eat well.” We can live
long, very long, and we do, most of
us, but we haven’t been eating
well, not for a long time now and
Grampa...

Rose looks down at the pale man by the firelight.

ROSE (CONT'D)
He turned me, you know. A long,
long time ago.

Crow approaches them.

CROW
He’s going.

They step over Grampa Flick. As Andi watches, we realize
something has been happening - HIS SKIN IS FLICKERING.
“CYCLING” between being visible, normal skin, and being
TRANSPARENT. We have FLASHES of his skeleton within...

We can see his LIVER, HIS LUNGS, HIS VEINS AND ARTERIES. THE
NERVES CONNECTING HIS EYES TO HIS BRAIN -- And then, he’s
BACK, and those eyes fix on Rose.

GRAMPA FLICK
Rosie...

ROSE
Yes, love.
78.

She crouches to him. Holds his hand.

GRAMPA FLICK
I’m scared...

ROSE

(defiant)
No. No you’re not. Not you, my
love. You watched empires rise and
fall, cheered the gladiators in
Rome. You sailed across oceans to
new worlds and you fed on Kings,
princes, and popes. They wrote
myths of you and made statues and
they trembled in their villages and
beds and skyscrapers and they
screamed, screamed at your coming.
They broke against you like waves
on rocks and they died by the
billions as you burned like a sun,
for eons. EONS. So no. You are not
scared. Not you. You are a god, and
you eat fear. You are not afraid.

He smiles. Tears fall down her cheeks.

ROSE (CONT'D)
Look at us. Look at the family you
made. We are your legacy, love, and
we are legion.

As he looks at them -- the CYCLING BEGINS AGAIN. Violent this
time. He SCREAMS as his body CONTORTS, FLASHING transparent,
then back, then INTO SOMETHING ELSE --

SOMETHING UNDERNEATH IT ALL, UNDER THE SKIN AND THE BULGING
EYES AND THE VEINS AND THE BONES --

SOMETHING LIKE AN INSECT, ITS EYES GLOWING FIERY RED --
INHUMAN MOUTH OPEN IN A SCREAM -- CYCLING BETWEEN THESE THREE
VERSIONS OF HIMSELF, SCREAMING IN AGONY UNTIL --

HE BURSTS APART. Not an explosion... just as though he has
ATOMIZED. His physical body CONVERTING... TO STEAM.

And, TEARS in their eyes, his “family” steps forward -- AND
BEGINS BREATHING HIM IN. FEASTING.

CUT TO:
79.

INT. HALLWAY, ELLIOT STREET - BEFORE DAWN

Dan knocks at the door. Again. And again. After a few
moments... Billy answers.

BILLY
It’s four in the morning --

DAN
You've always seen me, Billy. Got a
sense about people, that fair to
say? You think I’m an honest man? A
good man?

Billy stares at him. Confused.

BILLY
I do, Dan.

DAN
I need your help. And the first
thing I need is for you to listen
to a story and try - harder than
you've ever tried - to believe me.

INT. DAN’S CAR - SUNRISE
Dan drives down the highway. He looks over at the passenger
seat, where BILLY IS SLEEPING. The vast countryside, the sun

coming up. A voice from the back seat.

ABRA (V.O.)
How’s it going?

Dan smiles.

DAN
Shouldn't you be getting ready for
school?
The camera pivots -- revealing ABRA, in the back seat.
ABRA

Yeah but I wanted to tag along. How
long have you been driving?

DAN
Few hours so far. We should be
there tonight. Late.

ABRA
Who's that?
80.

Dan looks over at Billy, sleeping soundly.

DAN
A friend. Maybe my best friend.
(beat)
Any more visitors?

ABRA
No. And I’ve tried to find her
again, but she put up a firewall.

DAN
Well when we get the glove, we’ll
know where they are. And we need
to, more than ever. Now that she’s
really onto you.

INT. ABRA'S HOUSE, ABRA'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Abra sits in her bed, headphones on. Concentrating. She
smiles, leaning back.

ABRA
You should have seen her face. She
was scared, Uncle Dan.

INT. DAN'S CAR -— CONTINUOUS
Abra smiles at him. She is ENJOYING THIS.

ABRA

Scared like those kids were scared.
All those kids she’s killed... she
was so mad, and so scared, that I
got inside.

(beat)
That was a new trick. I’ve never
done that before.

DAN
I haven’t either. What was it like?

ABRA
Like a library. I guess we’re all
libraries, inside. It looked like a
cathedral of file cabinets, but
only because that’s how she thought
of them. If she was thinking of a
museum, or a computer, I would have
seen that, I think.
81.
DAN
How'd you do it?

ABRA
Like this, just a little push --

Dan JOLTS, the car wheel SPINNING a little in his hand. For a
moment, a FLASH --

INT. OVERLOOK HOTEL, LIBRARY - NIGHT

-- the LIBRARY of the OVERLOOK. A TYPEWRITER on a desk. File
cabinets, many, from the floor to the ceiling... Then a flash

into DARKNESS --

AN ABYSSAL DARKNESS, FILLED WITH LOCKED BOXES. DOZENS AND
DOZENS OF THEM. LIKE COFFINS...

Abra STEPS toward the lock boxes, each the size of a PERSON.
The LIDS BUMPING, SCRATCHING. THINGS TRYING TO GET OUT --

DAN (V.O.)
Abra!
INT. ABRA'S HOUSE, ABRA'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Abra LANDS on the floor of her bedroom.

ABRA
Sorry! Sorry...

Her door opens, and David pokes his head in.

DAVID
You okay?

ABRA
Yeah, sorry, rolled out of bed.

DAVID
You feeling any better?

ABRA
I’m okay dad. Sorry about that.

He leaves. Abra stands up, getting back onto her bed.

INT. DAN'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

Dan shakes his head, laughing a little, glancing at Billy.
STILL ASLEEP. Abra appears in the back seat again.
82.

ABRA

I’m sorry. I wasn’t trying to --
DAN

It’s okay.
ABRA

You're strong. I mean it... you

just pushed me right out. Like it
was nothing.

(beat)
What were those boxes?

DAN
Nothing.
ABRA
Liar.
DAN
(long beat)
When I was a kid... younger than
you... I bumped into something like

these things. Something that ate,
like they do. Only it wasn’t a
person... it was a place.

(beat)
They closed it down, after. Let it
rot. But some of the things that
lived there, they... don’t poke
around in there again.

ABRA
I won’t. I promise.
(beat)
Thank you. For helping me.

DAN
Don’t thank me yet, kiddo.

CUT TO:

EXT. CAMPSITE - EVENING

Rose sits at the edge of the woods, looking out in the trees.
Behind her, Crow approaches.

CROW
We’re almost ready. Loading up.

ROSE
Good. Get the caravan on the road,
we'll have her in a day or two...
CROW
I don’t think you should come.
ROSE
(beat)
The fuck did you just say?
CROW
She tagged you. She got in your
head --
ROSE

Won’t happen again. I
underestimated her a bit but it
won't happen again --

CROW
She knows you. And who knows how
much she got to before you kicked
her out.

ROSE
She’s mine, Crow.

CROW
She is. But right now, far as we
know, you’re the only one of us she
could track. She sees you coming,
she could run. Or set another trap.
Better you hang back.

He steps toward her, putting his hands on her

CROW (CONT'D)
I’1l knock her out cold. One of our
assets in the NSA gave me the good
stuff, put her out without a chance
of overdose. I’m gonna head South,
circle around, come at her froma
different direction --

ROSE
I should be there.

CROW
I'll sniff her out, like I always
do. Track her right to the door,
like I always do. Deliver her right
to your feet, like always. All
yours. But if she sees you coming
it puts us all in danger and you
know that, Rosie, you know I’m
right about this.

83.

arms.
84.

Rose nods. He’s right.

CROW (CONT'D)
I‘1l leave Andi with you, if you
want --

ROSE
No. You’ll need your strength, all
of you, if she pulls a trick on
you. You stay together.

CROW
I got some tricks of my own.

He kisses her. Smiles. And turns, heading back toward the
vans. Rose watches him go.

CUT TO:

EXT. SECLUDED ROAD - NIGHT
Billy’s driving now. Dan sits beside him, exhausted.

BILLY
I think we're here.

Dan sits up. There’s nothing but CORN FIELDS all around.
DAN
Okay, let me see if I can get her.
(beat)
Abra...
And long beat. And then, she’s in the back seat.

ABRA
That's the sign.

She points. Dan follows. There, in the headlights: ORGANIC
INDUSTRIES. ETHANOL PLANT #4. CLOSED UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE.

ABRA (CONT'D)
Pull around back --

DAN
Pull around back --

ABRA
And I’1l tell you when to stop --

DAN
She’1l tell us when to stop.
85.

Billy looks over at him. Worried.

BILLY
I gotta tell you, Danno. I don’t
know whether I hope you’re right or
wrong about this. I mean if you’re
wrong, it means my friend is crazy.
I mean full-blown-mental-breakdown-
monsters-killing-imaginary-kids
bonkers, but I can work with that.
If you're right though...

DAN
I know. It’s much worse.

EXT. ABANDONED ETHANOL PLANT - LATER

Billy and Dan stand in a familiar spot. FRESH DIRT. Darker
now, with only the one set of headlights. The plant looming
above them. Dan pulls the SHOVELS out of the back of the car.

DAN
You should go home.

BILLY
What? You said you needed my help -

DAN
Not you.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL: Abra, standing with them.
BILLY
Oh... you’re talking to her? She’s

here now?

ABRA
I can handle it.

DAN
No. We'll take it from here.

Abra hangs back, reluctant. Finally, she is gone.

DAN (CONT'D)
Okay. Just us.

Billy looks at him, scared, as Dan starts DIGGING. And
digging. Some time passes...

DAN (CONT'D)
You smell that?
86.

Billy keeps digging. Face pale.

BILLY
Used to hunt. Did I ever tell you
that?

DAN
No.

BILLY

Deer. This one summer, I clipped
this buck, had been tracking him
two days, and I got the shot and I
clipped him. He ran off. I went
after, figured he wasn’t gonna last
long but he vanished, just up and
evaporated. Not a trace. Truly
baffling.

Dan and Billy keep digging.

BILLY (CONT'D)
Five days later, I’m trying a
different spot. Miles away. Miles.
And I come round, looking for a
spot for the blind, and I smelled
him... smelled him. Found that
buck, huddled up to a hollow trunk.
Dead for days. The smell, the look
of him -- never hunted a day since.
(beat)
This’s the same smell.

They dig more. Dirt piles a little higher. And then...

DAN
Billy.

Billy looks over. There, barely revealed in the dirt... is
the LEATHER OF A SHOE. Sticking out.

They lock eyes, and gently drop to their knees. Digging
higher with their gloved hands... HOLDING THEIR BREATH,
GASPING for air when they can. And finally they stand back.

Protruding from the dirt, is the SCREAMING, ROTTING FACE of
Bradley Trevor. STILL LOCKED IN HORROR, bugs and worms having
their day. The BASEBALL GLOVE, clutched in his hands.

Dan leans forward, CRYING NOW. He reaches out, GENTLY SLIDING
THE BASEBALL GLOVE through the white, broken fingers.

DAN (CONT'D)
Jesus wept.
87.

Billy STUMBLES out of the shallow grave, VOMITING onto the
ground. Dan follows, looking sadly down.

BILLY
Fuck... fuck, Danno. How the
fuck... they didn’t even bury him
deep. They buried him shallow.

DAN
I’m sorry, Billy.

BILLY
What did you get us into --

He puts his hand on his shoulder.

BILLY (CONT'D)
What do we do now --

DAN
We cover him back up. Call the
police from a payphone, on the way
out of town. Let his parents have
him, at least. And we get this
glove to the girl who needs it.

INT. DAN'S CAR —- MORNING

Dan drives, Billy sits in the passenger seat. Shell shocked.
Looking out at the sun over the empty fields.

BILLY
The people who did that...

DAN
They aren’t people.

BILLY
No. No they aren’t. Anyone who
would do that to a little boy...
they’re not people.
(beat)
But they’re coming.

DAN
Yes.

Billy nods. Processing.

ABRA (0.S.)
Did you get it?

Dan sighs. Abra is in the back seat.
88.

DAN
Yeah, we got it.

BILLY
She's back?

DAN
We're heading to you. We’1ll be
there in the morning, we have a
stop to make. Abra... I need you to
show your parents what’s happening.

ABRA
No!

DAN
Yes.

ABRA

No! They just -- they almost think
I’m normal! If I tell them -

DAN
Rose’1ll go through them to get to
you. You know that, don’t you?
She'll cut them down without a
second thought and she is coming,
Abra. They need to know.

Abra GLARES at him. Tears in her eyes. And then... she’s
gone. Dan sighs. Looks over at Billy.

BILLY
What stop do we have to make?

DAN
Do you still have that old deer
rifle?

Billy looks at him. The color draining from his face.

CUT TO:

EXT. ABRA’S HOUSE - THE NEXT MORNING

Dan pulls into the driveway. He’s CLEANED UP, the dirt all
gone. Billy is with him. As Dan steps out of the car --

DAVID bursts through the front door. Abra TUGGING at him.

DAVID
(furious)
You're “Uncle Dan?”
89.

ABRA
Dad!

DAVID
The fuck do you think you are --

DAN
Sir --

DAVID
She is thirteen years old --

DAN
(to Abra)
I told you to show him --

ABRA
I told him!

DAN
Not the same thing.

DAVID
I'm kicking your ass before I call
the police --

David GRABS Dan, SPINNING him around, SHOVING HIM ONTO THE
CAR. Billy RUSHES FORWARD.

BILLY
Hey --

Dan HOLDS UP HIS HAND, waving Billy back.

DAN
Abra --
DAVID
Don’t say her name you sick son of
a bitch --
DAN
Abra!

David WRAPS HIS ELBOW around Dan’s neck, HURLING HIM DOWN,
ready to POUND HIS FACE --

David suddenly SCREAMS as a LOUD NOISE fills his head. Like
an AIR HORN, CRUSHING HIS EARS. He STUMBLES BACK, hands to
his ears. Billy watches... HE CAN’T HEAR ANYTHING.

Finally the noise STOPS, and another noise fills his head:
90.

ABRA (V.O.)
DAD.

David STUMBLES, his hands coming up to his head. Abra’s voice
LOUD inside his mind. He spins back to her, STUNNED.

ABRA (V.O.)
STOP.

Dan gets to his feet.
DAN
I’m sorry Mister Stone. I'ma
friend. And everything she told you
is true.

DAVID
The hell... is happening...

DAN
Abra needs to show you something.

CUT TO:

INT. ABRA'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

They sit at the table. David shakes his head. Still angry,
but mostly CONFUSED.

BILLY
I saw him. I saw the body, it’s
true.

DAVID

Probably your friend here put him
there. You think about that?

BILLY
Not for long, I didn’t.

DAN
Your daughter is special, Mr.
Stone.

DAVID
Don’t talk about her --

DAN
And you know that. Deep down.

David doesn’t answer.
91.

DAN (CONT'D)

She saw what happened to that

little boy, and she saw who did it.
(turning to Abra)

Show him.

Abra walks toward David. Reaches up, touching his head.

ABRA
I’m sorry Daddy. I really didn’t
want to...

DAVID

Didn’t want to what --
She closes her eyes. And suddenly --

FLASHES. THE ETHANOL PLANT. BRADLEY’S SCREAMING FACE. ROSE,
LEANING OVER HIM...

Dan and Billy watch sadly as David CONVULSES in the chair,
the images playing through his head. A look of BEWILDERED
HORROR ON HIS FACE.

Tears fall as he relives Bradley’s final moments... and then
he SCREAMS --

INT. ABRA'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - LATER

A SHAKING HAND pours a glass of whiskey. We follow it up to
David's pale face, still processing what he just saw. Downing
the drink in a single gulp. He turns to Dan and Billy.

DAVID
Drink?

They each manage a very small, sad smile. Waving him away.

DAN AND BILLY
No thanks.

DAVID
Those... people. They know about my
daughter?

DAN
They do. And sooner or later,
they’re coming.

DAVID
We've gotta do something. Call the
police, the FBI --
92.

DAN
They've been doing this a long,
long time sir. They are ancient,
rich, and connected. I don’t think
they're very worried about police.

DAVID
Well where are they? When are they
coming? Where can we go --

DAN
Abra can answer that. If she’s
ready.

Abra sits at the table. Steeling herself.

ABRA
I’m ready.

Dan reaches into his bag, and slowly - reverently - removes
the BASEBALL GLOVE. She stares at it.

DAN
Are you sure you want to do this?
I'm asking all of you. This is
dangerous. I mean truly, truly
dangerous.

ABRA
I have to. They already know me.
They're already on their way. And
they can’t keep doing this, Uncle
Dan. We can’t let them.

He moves toward her. Holding it out. Abra takes a breath...
and TAKES THE GLOVE. CLOSING HER EYES.

We hold on her. Hearing the gentle sounds of a HIGHWAY fading
up. And when she opens her eyes, she’s in --
INT. CROW’S RV - DAY

-- Crow’s RV. STARING AT BARRY’S HAND... the same hand that
wore the glove. HER TRACKING POINT.

She looks up from Barry, who is asleep in his chair. Looking
toward the driver’s seat -- WHERE CROW IS DRIVING. She turns
back, toward the back of the RV, looking out the window --

AT ANOTHER VEHICLE. SNAKEBITE ANDI IS DRIVING. There’s a
small CARAVAN on the move...
93.

INT. ABRA'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
Abra OPENS HER EYES.

ABRA
I-95. Barry, the Crow, the Snake
and a few others. They’re close.
Very close. The trees haven’t
changed that much, maybe
Massachusetts but they’re close.

DAN
Rose?

ABRA
Didn't see her. But they’re coming.
(beat)
I don’t want them anywhere near my
dad. Nowhere.

DAVID
If you think I’m leaving you --

DAN
You're not.

INT. ABRA'S HOUSE, ABRA'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Dan steps into Abra’s bedroom, followed by Abra, David and
Billy. He looks around.

DAN
This is the only room she saw?

ABRA
That’s right. And I made some
changes. Hid some things.

DAN
Okay... they’1l be trying to track
you. Trying to catch on.

His eyes go to the STUFFED BUNNY by her bed. The same one she
carried when she was a little girl. Dan stares. AN IDEA.

DAN (CONT'D)
And you're going to let them.

ABRA
Are you crazy?
94,

DAN
Probably. But you’re going to let
them, and then I need you to try to
do a little trick.

ABRA
(smiling)
A magic trick?

DAN
More like ventriloquism.

CUT TO:

INT. DAN'S CAR - DAY

Dan drives. Beside him, Abra sits in the passenger seat.
Billy is in the back. No sign of David.

ABRA
(eyes closed)
They're following us.

DAN

Good. Let them. You okay?
ABRA

I’m okay.
DAN

Concentrate. You've gotta keep it
up until they land.

ABRA
I know.
EXT. STATE PARK - LATER

Dan’s car drives into the STATE PARK entrance. Passing
CAMPGROUNDS... heading deeper into the woods.

CUT TO:

EXT. CAMPSITE - DAY

Rose steps out of her camper. Looks around the nearly
deserted campsite, sighing. She CLIMBS THE LADDER, getting
onto the roof. Sitting lotus, quieting herself.
95.

ROSE
Okay, Crow Daddy. Go get her.

CUT TO:

EXT. STATE PARK, CAMPSITE - LATER

Dan’s car comes to a stop. He climbs out, looking around. A
nice, secluded area... no other campers, not just yet. Some
PICNIC TABLES. Billy gets out behind him, heading to the
TRUNK.

DAN
This could work.

BILLY
Good blinds, over there and there.

Dan walks to Abra’s door, opening it. Looking in at her.
She's sitting VERY STILL, concentrating hard.

DAN
Still close?

ABRA
Getting closer. I think. This is
tough -

DAN
I know. Not much longer. Come on.
Let’s get you ready.

CUT TO:

EXT. STATE PARK, CAMPSITE - LATER

The RV moves slowly through the park. Purposefully. Down the
wooded path... and to the clearing.

EXT. STATE PARK, CAMPSITE - CONTINUOUS

The vehicle comes to a stop. The doors open... and Andi,
Barry, Silent Sarey and Apron Annie STEP OUT. Trying to look
casual. Looking across the field, toward the picnic area --

WHERE ABRA SITS at the table, eyes closed. Concentrating.

Andi points. Barry nods, and they start FANNING OUT. Heading
toward her.
96.

BY THE TREE LINE: Dan and Billy CROUCH. HIDING. Watching them
through RIFLE SCOPES. THE CROSSHAIRS ON THE GROUP...

BILLY
(whispering)
I don’t know, Dan. Jesus, I don’t
know if I can do this -

DAN
I know. I know...

BILLY
I mean, they’re people. I don’t
know if I can just...

DAN
Look at their hands.

He does. He sees -- SYRINGES. In Andi’s hand, and in Barry's,
as they approach Abra.

BY THE TABLES: Andi steps closer. Abra is SITTING STILL, EYES
CLOSED. CONCENTRATING.

ANDI
Excuse me, sweetheart.

Abra opens her eyes.

ANDI (CONT'D)
You look relaxed. You feel relaxed,
don’t you Abra.

ABRA
(beat)
I guess.

ANDI
You should. Just relax. We’re
friends.

ABRA
You're friends.

ANDI
That’s right.

She steps closer, syringe behind her back.

ANDI (CONT'D)
Just friends, and we want to take
you to meet more friends. Good
friends.
97.

She gets closer. Close enough to reach out and touch her.

BY THE TREE LINE: Dan’s finger tightens on the trigger. Billy
watches through the scope as Andi LIFTS THE NEEDLE.

BY THE TABLES: Andi STICKS THE NEEDLE INTO ABRA’S ARM,
depressing the syringe. And laughs to herself.

ANDI (CONT'D)
Well shit, the way they talked you
up, I was expecting it to be little
harder than that...

Her smile fades. She STARES... Abra ISN'T THERE. She just
stuck a syringe into ABRA’S STUFFED BUNNY.

She BLINKS. The spell broken. Looks around wildly. As she
turns, her eyes BURN WITH LIGHT. LIKE FLAMES.

Billy GASPS when he sees her eyes --

BILLY
Oh my god.

DAN
They're not people, Billy. Not even
close.
Andi GLARES at Barry.

ANDI
The fuck?

Barry and the others CONVERGE, eyes wild.
BARRY
Parlor tricks. Fucking parlor
tricks -

BANG. A bullet SPINS HIM AROUND.

EXT. CAMPSITE - CONTINUOUS
Rose suddenly LURCHES FORWARD, GASPING IN PAIN.
ROSE
Get out get out get out of there --
EXT. STATE PARK, CAMPSITE - CONTINUOUS

They turn toward the tree line --
98.

Where Dan and Billy OPEN FIRE. BANG BANG BANG BANG BANG --

The bullets STRIKE APRON ANNIE and SILENT SAREY as they DIVE
FOR COVER. Barry PULLS HIS OWN PISTOL, FIRING BACK -—

BILLY SHOOTS HIM IN THE HEAD.
BARRY DROPS, HIS BODY CYCLING FAST -

BILLY
Holy shit --

Barry’s skin CYCLING, TRANSLUCENT, HIS SCREAMING SKULL
VISIBLE THROUGH HIS SKIN BEFORE HIS TRUE FORM, HIS INSECT-
LIKE FORM, FLASHES BRIEFLY --

And he BURSTS AWAY IN A CLOUD OF STEAM --

BANG BANG - Apron Annie and Silent Sarey SLAM INTO TREES, AND
THE GROUND, BEFORE CYCLING VIOLENTLY AWAY --

Andi is HIT in the shoulder, SPINNING HER LIKE A TOP. She
SCRAMBLES BACK toward the RV, looking up to see --

ABRA, STARING AT HER. GRINNING.

ANDI
You little shit --

ABRA
You deserve it. You --
INT. ABRA'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Abra SITS ON HER KITCHEN TABLE, MEDITATING. GRINNING. Beside
her, David watches, NERVOUS.

ABRA
-- deserve it. All of you.

EXT. STATE PARK, CAMPSITE - CONTINUOUS

Dan and Billy ADVANCE on the RV. FIRING at another True Knot
member, KNOCKING THEM DOWN. They start to CYCLE on the
ground. They flank the RV, moving fast.

Billy gestures that he’s going around back, and Dan heads for
the door. Inside, Andi’s FACE pops up by the window, and Dan
FIRES -- but he’s OUT OF AMMO.

ANDI
Neat trick.
99.
Dan frantically tries to reload, dropping to one knee.
Pulling out some AMMO, loading the gun fast.

ANDI (CONT'D)
Where’s the girl?

CLICK. He chambers a round.
ANDI (CONT'D)
Got just one question for you

sweetie...

He brings the gun up, training it on the window. Waiting...
Andi’s face APPEARS IN THE DOOR.

ANDI (CONT'D)
Aren’t you sleepy?

Dan DROPS to one knee. The gun FALLING FROM HIS HAND. He’s
suddenly VERY TIRED, trying to WILL HIMSELF TO STAY AWAKE.
Andi GASPS as he STARTS TO GET BACK UP.
ANDI (CONT'D)
(impressed)
You're sleepy.
Dan GLARES AT HER. DEFIANT.

ANDI (CONT'D)
Sleep.

Dan KEEPS FIGHTING. Andi stares at him, NOT SURE WHAT'S
HAPPENING. WHY ISN’T THIS WORKING... she steps out of the RV.

ANDI (CONT'D)
Sleep.

Finally, Dan DROPS. UNCONSCIOUS.

CUT TO:

INT. ABRA'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
Abra BOLTS UP, panicked.

ABRA
Wake up! Uncle Dan, WAKE UP --

CUT TO:
100.

DARKNESS.
Abra’s voice, far away, trying to push through the dark...

ABRA (0.S.)
WAKE UP!

Dan’s eyes start to open.

EXT. STATE PARK, CAMPSITE - MOMENTS LATER

Dan squints, looking up to Andi, who is standing over him.
Lifting his gun.

ANDI
Fucking men. Fucking men...

DAN
(groggy)
Child eater.
Andi stops. Stares at him.
ANDI
You rubes slaughter cows, pigs.
Chickens. It’s no different.
She raises the gun, pointing it at his head --
DAN CLOSES HIS EYES --
BANG.
He opens them. The shot didn’t come from Andi... it came from
BILLY, who leans against the corner of the RV. PISTOL SMOKING
IN HIS HAND. He got her RIGHT IN THE NECK.

Andi DROPS THE RIFLE, hand to her wound. BANG - the second
shot HITS HER CHEST, SPINNING HER. SHE HITS THE GROUND.

Billy steps closer as Dan tries to GET TO HIS KNEES.

BILLY
Fuck... fuck. That’s all of them,
Danno. That’s all --
DAN
(choking)

Stay back -

Andi lays on the ground, her skin CYCLING. Her eyes STARING
at Billy through her translucent skin, the blood from the
BULLET WOUNDS visible spreading through body as she cycles.
101.

He stares, AWESTRUCK...

ANDI

(raspy)
Kill yourself.

Billy BLINKS. Dan BURSTS forward, trying to GRAB THE GUN --

DAN
Billy no! No!

Billy STRUGGLES AGAINST DAN as Andi LAUGHS, cycling on the
ground... and Billy SMASHES the stock of the gun into Dan’s
face, KNOCKING HIM BACK.

Billy looks at him, helpless, eyes wide and terrified as he
TURNS THE PISTOL ON HIMSELF --

DAN (CONT'D)
Noooo --

BILLY FIRES. Dan STARES. Devastated. A SPLASH of blood
hitting his face. The sound of Billy’s body hitting the
ground, and then...

ANDI FINISHES CYCLING, A BURST OF STEAM DISSIPATING INTO THE
AIR. Dan crawls to Billy. TEARS IN HIS EYES.

DAN (CONT'D)

I’m sorry... I’m so sorry...
Billy looks at him, still confused... and then RED STEAM
rises from Billy’s mouth and nose. A DEATH RATTLE... and then

Billy is gone.

Dan CRIES, looking around. Helpless. Barely aware of ABRA,
standing over his shoulder. Watching.

ABRA
There’s one missing -- there was a
van. There was a van.
He turns to her, not understanding.
ABRA (CONT'D)
I didn’t see the Crow. Where’s the
CROW --
And she suddenly VANISHES.

DAN
Abra. Abra!!!

CUT TO:
102.

INT. ABRA'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Abra LOOKS UP, lip quivering. A NEEDLE stuck in her neck, the
syringe DEPRESSED. CROW smiles at her as she stares at him.

CROW
Hello, Abra.

She COLLAPSES, he CATCHES HER. Starts to lift her up...

DAVID (0.S.)
Get away from her.

Crow stops. Turns. Chuckles to himself to see DAVID, standing
at the kitchen door. A KNIFE in his hand.

DAVID (CONT'D)
Step back.

Crow gently places Abra down on the table.

CROW
Sure thing, daddy. You know, I’m
glad we got to meet.

DAVID
I'll kill you.

CROW
Brave words. Always tickles me,
watching you rubes threaten a god.

You know, your little girl... she’s
maybe the best food we’ll ever
have.

He steps toward David.
CROW (CONT'D)
I’m so glad I had a chance to
compliment the chef.

CUT TO:

EXT. ABRA'S HOUSE - MINUTES LATER

The front door opens. Crow carries Abra to the driveway,
where his VAN is parked. He leaves the door open behind him,
and through the doorway we see --

DAVID'S LIFELESS BODY, crumpled on the kitchen floor.

CUT TO:
103.

EXT. STATE PARK, CAMPSITE - CONTINUOUS

Dan spins around in the field, next to the abandoned RV.
Desperate. Tears on his face, blood on his clothes.

DAN
Abra! Abra! Abra!

Silence. No response. He stands in the field, looking around.
The only evidence that anything bad ever happened here... is
BILLY'S CORPSE, sprawled out by the camper.

Broken, alone, Dan heads to his car.

CUT TO:

EXT. CAMPSITE - CONTINUOUS

Rose PACES, tears on her face. RAGE. And finally her PHONE
RINGS. She looks at it, relieved, rushing it to her ear.

ROSE
Tell me you got her.

A beat... and then she RELAXES.

ROSE (CONT'D)
Thank you. Thank you love.

CUT TO:

INT. VAN - EVENING

Abra lays on the back seat. TIED UP with her seatbelt. She
starts to COME TO, blinking. GROGGY. Looking around with
GROWING PANIC.

CROW
Oh good, you’re awake.

She looks up at him. SQUEEZES HER EYES SHUT.

ABRA
Dan -

CROW
Don’t bother.

Abra dry heaves, trying to get her bearings.

ABRA
What’s wrong with me...
104.

CROW
You are dosed, missy. More than I
ever used before. Might let you
wake up, here and there, but that
steam of yours is fast asleep.

ABRA
(realizing)
My dad.

Crow doesn’t answer.

ABRA (CONT'D)
(angry)
What happened to my dad.

CROW
Lotta good people killed today.
Lotta good people.

Abra starts to cry.

CROW (CONT'D)

Would love to tell you someone will
pay, some kind of justice raining
down for the sad events today but
it don’t work like that. We were
always gonna have you. Some of my
people are dead, some of yours
dead... outcome didn’t change,
though. Think on that a minute.
Outcome didn’t change, so their
deaths... all of them... just a
waste. A waste, you brought on us
all. For what?

Abra closes her eyes. Tries to reach out to Dan.

ABRA
Please... hear me...

CROW
Ain’t no one hearing you, darling.
Might as well calm down, enjoy the
ride. Like I said. Outcome hasn’t
changed.

CUT TO:

INT. DAN'S ROOM, ELLIOT STREET - LATER THAT NIGHT

Dan enters the room, a BROWN BAG in his hand. He frantically
pulls out its contents... A BOTTLE OF WHISKEY.
105.

DAN
Oh please, please please please.
(concentrates)
Abra... Abra! Abra!

Silence.

DAN (CONT'D)
(concentrating)

Dick... you there? I need help... I

need your help... Dick please...

He STARES AT IT. Tears on his cheeks. Closes his eyes.

DAN (CONT'D)
Don’t Doc. You don’t need it, you
don’t...

(quiet)
Someone help me. Tony... please
help me, Tony.

Silence. He leans forward, PICKING UP THE BOTTLE. Holds it in
his hands. Stares at it. And after a few long, AGONIZING
MOMENTS --

EXT. ELLIOTT STREET - MOMENTS LATER

The bottle flies out of Dan’s window, SMASHING on the
sidewalk below.

INT. DAN'S ROOM, ELLIOT STREET - CONTINUOUS

Dan sits back down. Staring at the wall in front of him, the
word MURDER cracked into the wall.

DAN
Okay. Okay. He always said your
brain was like a radio...

He sits lotus, collecting himself.

DAN (CONT'D)
No one’s answering when you call.
So stop calling.

(beat)
And just listen.

Dan concentrates. A haze of noise... and then VOICES. DOZENS.
HUNDREDS. THEN THOUSANDS... VOICES IN THE DARK. OVERWHELMING.
DAN WAITS. WAITS.
106.

He tries to sort through them. Concentrating harder than he
ever has before. BLOOD BEGINS TO RUN FROM HIS NOSE.

And finally, there in the mess of noise, a TINY VOICE...

ABRA (0.S.)
Dan...

He THROWS HIS ARMS out in front of him as the entire room
TIPS FORWARD. He SLIDES ACROSS THE FLOOR, BRACING HIMSELF UP
AGAINST THE WALL --

And OPENS HIS EYES. HIS WALL IS GONE. He’s in a VAN. ABRA is
on the seat in front of him, curled down. CRYING QUIETLY.

DAN
Hi.

She looks. Eyes wide, groggy. Tries to sit up.

DAN (CONT'D)
Don’t talk.

He looks past her, to where CROW is driving. Looks at the
SEAT BELTS tied around Abra, holding her down.

DAN (CONT'D)
He drugged you.

She nods.

DAN (CONT'D)
I’m so sorry.

ABRA (V.O.)
Help...

He leans forward.

DAN
I’m going to try something. You're
weak, and he’s blocking you, I
could barely hear you... I need you
to trust me. Okay? Okay?

She nods. He reaches out his hand, toward hers. She
STRETCHES, trying to touch his fingertips with her own...

CUT TO:
INT. VAN - MOMENTS LATER

107.

Crow drives along. Behind him, Abra SITS UP in her seat.

Staring right at him. He glances in the mirror.

CROW
Awake again, huh? Might need to
dose you at the next rest stop.

ABRA
Where are we going?

CROW
You know where.

Abra looks around.

ABRA
Fuck. I feel... hung over.

CROW
Told you. It’s good shit.

ABRA
Haven't felt hungover in years. And
you know I don’t miss it. Not even
a little.

Crow pauses. Looks at her in the mirror.
ABRA (CONT'D)
(looking out the window)
West... staying off the major
roads, huh? Smart.
She sees a sign. CROWNVILLE, 10 MILES.

ABRA (CONT'D)
Crownville. New York.

Crow stares. Looks closely. Abra looks back at him in the

mirror, but her EYES ARE DIFFERENT. COLDER. ANGRY.

AND THEY’RE BROWN. NOT BLUE.

CROW
(quietly)
Who are you?

ABRA
I’m the guy that killed your
friends.
108.

Crow freezes. Isn’t sure what to do. Clenches up, like a man
walking through a mine field.

CROW
Well nice to meet you. Neat
trick... haven’t seen this one
before.

ABRA

Wanna see one more?
Crow slowly REACHES for the gun at his hip.

ABRA (CONT'D)
Don’t imagine Rose’1ll be happy if
you shoot the prize.

Crow’s hand stops.

CROW
Don’t suppose Rose is gonna be
happy about any of this. And when
that woman gets mad... Well, seems
to me you know enough to know you
might wanna sit this one out. Count
your blessings, go on your way.

Abra reaches around, checking her SEAT BELT. She LAUGHS.

CROW (CONT'D)
What’s so funny, friend.

ABRA
Well, it’s just... arrogance.
Arrogance, really. But it makes
sense. If you think you’re gonna
live forever, stands to reason...
She grins at him.
ABRA (CONT'D)
Of course you wouldn’t wear your
seat belt.
Crow glances down. His belt UNBUCKLED --
Abra THROWS HER HANDS OUT, JERKING THEM TO THE RIGHT --

THE STEERING WHEEL JERKS TO THE RIGHT AS SHE DOES --—
109.

EXT. SECLUDED ROAD - CONTINUOUS
The Van SWERVES FROM THE ROAD, through the guard rail,
BARRELING TOWARD THE TREES -- AND CRASHES. HARD. CROW IS
EJECTED through the windshield --

Dan JERKS AWAKE on his bedroom floor, the momentum of the
CRASH sending him FLYING BACKWARD against his bed --
EXT. CAMPSITE - CONTINUOUS
-- Rose DROPS TO HER KNEES, SCREAMING IN PAIN AND SHOCK...
ROSE
NOOOOO! !!
EXT. SECLUDED ROAD - MOMENTS LATER

The van is SLAMMED against the trees. Inside, Abra is HELD
FAST by her seat belts. She looks around, DISORIENTED...

ABRA
(weak)
Dan? Dan?

She gets out of the car. Walks toward the SMASHED HOOD -- And
sees CROW, CRUMPLED ON THE GROUND. CYCLING.

She crouches down next to him. He stares at her, SHOCKED AND
BEWILDERED, EYES BULGING BENEATH HIS TRANSLUCENT SKIN --

ABRA (CONT'D)
I hope that hurts. A lot.

He CYCLES, contorting one last time into the INHUMAN CREATURE
that resides underneath... And then VANISHES IN A RUSH OF
STEAM. Leaving Abra alone.

INT. DAN'S ROOM, ELLIOT STREET - CONTINUOUS

Dan SMILES. Gasping. Wiping the blood from his nose.

DAN
Hang tight, Abra. I’m coming.

He grabs his keys, and runs into the night.

CUT TO:
EXT. SECLUDED ROAD - LATER

110.

Abra WALKS up the street by herself, in the dark. Shaken by

the crash. As she does, she looks up and sees -—

ROSE. STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD, IN THE MOONLIGHT.
Abra GASPS -- but then realizes. She can see the MOONLIGHT

THROUGH ROSE.

ABRA
Well hi there.

Rose glares at her.

ABRA (CONT'D)
Guess there’s no point hiding
anymore, is there.

ROSE
You killed them. You killed him.

ABRA
The Crow? I did. And I’m gonna kill
you, Rose the Hat.

Rose BRISTLES. Smiles at her... but we can see the RAGE

behind her eyes. The DISBELIEF.

ROSE
Big words, dear. Big words from
such a small child --

ABRA
A small child that just killed your
man.

ROSE

I’1ll come for you.

ABRA
I know. I hope so. Because if you
don’t, if you chicken out, you
coward, and I really need you to
hear me when I say this...

She steps close.

ABRA (CONT'D)
I’1ll come for you.

Abra PUSHES HER WAY through Rose, and the projection BURSTS

AWAY like a puff of smoke.

CUT TO:
111.

INT. ROSE'S RV - CONTINUOUS
Rose OPENS HER EYES. Fuming.

ROSE
Alright, bitch-child. Alright.

Rose gets up, going to the CANISTERS OF STEAM. THE LAST OF
THEM. She TEARS THEM OPEN with her hands, GORGING HERSELF ON
THE STEAM that comes from them. Pulling it all in.

As we watch, her skin GLIMMERS. Her eyes GLOWING from the
pupils... she’s GETTING STRONGER. As the steam courses
through her, HER HAND BEGINS TO HEAL.

EXT. CROWN MOTEL - MORNING

Dan’s car pulls into the parking lot. He gets out, looking
around... and sees ABRA, crouched in the corner of the
parking lot. She runs to him, throwing her arms around him.

CUT TO:

INT. DAN’S CAR - AFTERNOON

Abra WAKES UP in the passenger seat. Dan is driving. She
looks out the window...

ABRA
I’m sorry, I dozed off.
DAN
You earned it.
ABRA
Where are we?
DAN
Ohio.
ABRA

Where are we going?

Dan looks at the road. His face pale.

DAN
(long beat)
Colorado.
ABRA

Why Colorado?
112.

DAN
(beat)
She's going to keep coming.
ABRA
I know.
DAN
Always. This only ends if we end
it... and I don’t think we can beat
her. Not by ourselves.
(beat)

There’s a place. It’s a dangerous
place, for people like us.

ABRA
The place you told me about. The
hungry place.

DAN
That’s right.

ABRA
If it’s so dangerous, why would we
go there?

DAN
Because if it’s dangerous for
people like us... and it is... I

expect it’s dangerous for people
like her. Maybe even more so.

They drive in silence.

ABRA
Good. She’s following us, you know.
DAN
That’s good. Let her.
(beat)
I’m sorry. About your father.
Abra nods. Takes a beat... and STARTS TO CRY.
ABRA
I’m sorry about your friend.
(beat)

This won’t end. Not unless we end
it. So let’s end it.

They drive on.

DISSOLVE TO:
113.

EXT. I-80 WEST - EVENING

Dan’s car blazes down the road. The fields of Iowa extending
around them.

INT. DAN'S CAR -— CONTINUOUS

Abra looks out the window.

ABRA
Iowa. Where this started.

DAN
Started before that, I’m afraid.

Abra’s PHONE RINGS. She looks at it...

ABRA
Oh no.
(beat)
It’s my mom.
Dan nods.
DAN
Tell her you’re okay. But don’t
tell her where we're going... you

don’t want Rose within a hundred
miles of her.

ABRA
I know. What do I say to her?

Dan reaches out, taking her hand. Abra answers the phone.
ABRA (CONT'D)
Hi Mom...
EXT. ABRA'S HOUSE - INTERCUT

Lucy sits on the curb, surrounded by POLICE. They’re going
through her house. Tears on her face, devastated and shocked.

LUCY
Oh thank god -- where are you? Are
you okay?

As she talks, several DETECTIVES stand beside her, listening.
114.

INT. DAN'S CAR - INTERCUT

Abra tries to hold it together.

ABRA
I’m okay, mom. I’m okay.

LUCY
Come home... my god, Abra, what’s
happening...

ABRA

I can’t tell you. Yet. But I’m
okay. I’m with a friend, and we’re
going to... we’re going to get the
people that did this to dad.

LUCY
Who did this?!

ABRA
I’m sorry mom. I’11 call when I
can.
(beat)
I love you.

She hangs up. Looks over at Dan.
ABRA (CONT'D)
When we’re safe, you’ll call her.
Tell her where to find us.

DAN
I will.

ABRA
Okay.

She rolls down the window, and THROWS THE PHONE OUT.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. GAS STATION, SIDEWINDER CO. - NIGHT

Abra looks up at the IMPOSING MOUNTAINS as Dan finishes
gassing up the car. A LIGHT SNOWFALL on the ground around
them, more on the mountains above. He climbs back inside.

DAN
Not too much further. Up the
mountain.
115.

ABRA
Are we going to win, Uncle Dan?

DAN
We have to.

They start driving.

EXT. MOUNTAIN PASS - NIGHT

The familiar mountain pass, the camera FLOATING OVERHEAD as
Dan’s car treks up the snowy mountainside. Higher and higher,
and further and further away from civilization. Toward the
one place in the world he fears the most.

EXT. OVERLOOK HOTEL - LATE AT NIGHT

Dan’s car approaches, and comes to a stop. The headlights
shining on the old hotel.

IT IS CONDEMNED. Dark, boarded up. The decades of NEGLECT AND
DECAY evident in its crumbling form, the once grand hedge-
maze just overgrown.

A foot of snow on the ground, almost enough to make the road
impassable. But somehow, they’ve made it.

Dan climbs out of the car. Face pale.

DAN
There it is.

Abra joins him.

DAN (CONT'D)
This is what we’re going to do.
You're going to stay in the car,
keep the heater running. I don’t
want you spending a minute inside
there if you don’t have to.

He points down the road, following it as it snakes around the
adjacent mountain.

DAN (CONT'D)
She can only come this way. You'll
see her a mile out, easy. You see
lights on the mountain, over
there... you blast me, okay? And
I‘1l meet you in the lobby.
116.

ABRA
You aren’t waiting with me?
DAN
I can’t, I’m afraid.
ABRA
Why not?
DAN

Because I’ve got to go wake it up.

She climbs back into the car, starting the engine. And Dan
Torrance walks through the snow, toward the Overlook Hotel.

CUT TO:

INT. OVERLOOK HOTEL, LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER

The camera FLOATS through the lobby. The hotel is TERRIBLY
DAMAGED, dark. Mold and water damage everywhere. Rotted
boards on the windows. This isn’t a hotel... it’s a carcass.

LOUD BANGS at the front doors. They get louder as we get
closer... and then we see the door GIVE WAY as Dan forces his
way inside. He walks in, looking around. The silence of the
place overwhelming.

He looks to his left, toward the ELEVATORS... long out of
order. Dark.

DAN
Wakey wakey.

He stands in the lobby, waiting. Waiting. And then...

A FEW OF THE LIGHTS START TO SHINE, VERY DIM. Almost
imperceptible. Just a FAINT CURRENT running through old
wires...

He nods. Good. He starts to walk further into the hotel.

INT. OVERLOOK HOTEL, BLUE HALLWAYS —- LATER

Dan walks the path his tricycle took so many years ago. PAST
THE KITCHEN WALLS, now grimy and rotted. Into the next
corridor, turning left --

REVEALING A HALL WITH FAMILIAR BLUE FLORAL WALLPAPER, some of
it peeling. He walks, looking up at the LIGHT FIXTURES,
watching as they continue to HUM WITH WEAK LIGHT... LIGHT
HE’S PROVIDING, as he continues to feed the hotel more power.
117.
He reaches the corner, and HESITATES BEFORE HE TURNS. We
hesitate too... we know what once stood on the other side.
Dan turns the corner, revealing A DARK HALL. The familiar
window at the end... but no little girls in blue dresses. He
keeps walking. Around him, the lights CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE
BACK TO LIFE.

CUT TO:

INT. OVERLOOK HOTEL, LIVING QUARTERS HALLWAY - LATER

He rounds another corner. Looking past the stairwell, at what
used to be the living quarters...

THE DOOR BROKEN APART. BY AN AXE. Hanging lazily open on its
hinge. He approaches the door, slowly PUSHING IT OPEN.
Stepping into:

INT. OVERLOOK, LIVING QUARTERS, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The LIVING ROOM. He can see the BEDROOM beyond it, all rotten
by time. He moves slowly into the --

INT. OVERLOOK, LIVING QUARTERS, BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

-- bedroom, and looks at the BATHROOM DOOR. The childish
SCRIBBLING, FADED, ON THE DOOR: REDRUM.

And above it, the GIANT HOLE created by his father’s axe. Dan
approaches it. Bringing his face CLOSE TO THE GAP, looking
through the broken door, just as his father once did...

To the little window, where he’d once crawled out into the
snow outside. He stares sadly at the room... And then turns,
walking back through the residence, into the dark hotel.

INT. OVERLOOK HOTEL, BOILER ROOM - LATER

Dan steps into the darkness of the boiler room. Dusty, cold.
Dark. He heads to the boiler, and starts TURNING VALVES.

INT. OVERLOOK HOTEL, GOLD ROOM - LATER

Dan moves down the hallway outside the GOLD ROOM. Realizing
there is LIGHT COMING FROM INSIDE...
118.

He steps into the double doors, looking past the TABLES AND
CHAIRS, toward the BROKEN STAGE at the front of the room. And
then seeing the source of the light...

THE BAR. At the far end of the room. LIT PERFECTLY from
below, an EMPTY GLASS on the bar. WAITING FOR HIM.

And after a long beat, he approaches the bar. Past the
formerly grand ball room, now dilapidated. He arrives,
sitting at one of the stools. Staring at the glass.

BARTENDER (0.S.)
Slow night, Mister Torrance.

In front of him, his back to us, a BARTENDER wipes glasses.

DAN
Not for long, I imagine.

BARTENDER
You're a whiskey man, are you not?

DAN
I was. Most of the time.

The bartender turns to him. We don’t see his face, but we see
Dan’s expression as he’s poured a glass of JACK DANIELS. He
always knew this day would come, somehow.

BARTENDER
On the house.

DAN
Thanks, dad.

We PULL BACK. Revealing the bartender... it is JACK TORRANCE
(40's). Dressed sharply, the same red tuxedo, the same black
bowtie, that LLOYD wore. Part of the staff now.

JACK
I'm afraid you’ve confused me with
someone else. It’s Lloyd.

DAN
Lloyd.

JACK
I apologize, I’m not sure where
everyone is. But it’1l pick up.

DAN
I know where they are. And you're
right, it’ll pick up.
(beat)
(MORE)
119.

DAN (CONT'D)

This was your brand, Jack Daniels.
I used to see the bottles at home -
our real home, before all this. Mom
would find them, hidden sometimes.
I smelled one once. Smelled like
something on fire. Which, I
suppose, it was.

JACK

Would you care for something else?
DAN

No.
JACK

What’s the old saying? “The ideal
man doesn't smoke, doesn't drink,
doesn't get angry --”

DAN
“Doesn't exist.”

JACK
Very good. If you don’t mind my
saying, Mister Torrance, you

seem... Put upon.
DAN
Put upon.
JACK

Ain’t that the way. Man just living
his life, trying to do his work,
gets put upon. Pulled into other
people’s problems, I see it all the
time. If you don’t mind my saying.

DAN
(beat)
So we lived in Florida.

JACK
I'm sorry?

DAN
Mom and I. We never wanted to see
snow again so we lived in Florida.
Tiny place, but comfortable and we
were happy. I mean we were
grieving, we were traumatized, but
there was happiness too.

He stares at the drink. Wanting it so bad.
120.

DAN (CONT'D)
I was twenty when she died. And not
my best self, not by a mile. She
saw it, saw you, in me, but she
loved me through it. Then she got
sick and back then I’d see - when
someone was gonna die - I'd see
flies. Black flies. Death flies, I
called them, circling people’s
faces, landing now and then and
those last weeks she was covered.
Her whole face. Could barely see
her eyes through them, and I’d try
to comfort her but I could hardly
look at her and she saw that. Laid
there dying while her son...
avoided looking...

Jack PUSHES the drink gently toward him.

JACK
Maybe something warm, to push away
such unpleasantries -

DAN
Don’t you want to hear? I mean, she
was your wife. You loved her in
your way, I know that. Don’t you
want to hear about her last days?
What she said about you?

JACK
I think you’ve mistaken me for
someone else. I’m just a bartender.

DAN
Right. Lloyd the bartender: pouring
joy at the Overlook Hotel.

JACK
I‘1l pour whatever you'd like,
Mister Torrance.

DAN
This drink costs an awful lot.

JACK
Your money’s no good here. Orders
from the house.

DAN
Won’t cost money. It’ll cost me
eight years. Eight behind me, and
who knows how many in front of me.
121.

JACK
Your credit is fine, Mister
Torrance.

Dan turns the glass. Rolling the booze around within.

DAN
When the others started coming back
- and they all did, over the years -
I expected you’d have your turn.
Thought I’d turn a corner and there
you'd be. Maybe with the axe. Maybe
typing away, hunched over your old
typewriter in the other room. Maybe
frozen in the snow... but you
didn’t come.

JACK
Perhaps a bourbon. We have an
extensive collection.

Dan picks up the glass. Turns it over in his hand. Wanting
it, more than he’s wanted a drink in a long time...

DAN
“Man takes a drink... the drink
takes a drink... then the drink
takes the man.” Ain’t it so, dad? I
wonder, frankly, what our lives
would have been - what our family
would have been - without this --

JACK
Medicine.

Jack stares him down. Something has CHANGED in his eyes.

JACK (CONT'D)

Medicine, is what it is. A bonafide
cure-all. Depression, stress,
failure, remorse, it wipes it all
out. The mind is a blackboard and
that’s the eraser and it’s good,
good medicine, Dan.

Jack leans forward, takes the glass from him. KNOCKS IT BACK.

JACK (CONT'D)
A man tries, he provides, but he’s
surrounded by mouths. Mouths that
eat, cry, scream, nag - so he asks
for one thing.

(MORE )
JACK (CONT'D)
One thing, just for him, to warm
him up, take the sting out of days
of those mouths eating and eating
and eating everything he makes.
Everything he has. And a family, a
wife, a kid - those mouths eat
time. Eat your days on earth.
Gobble them up, chew them to paste
and even then, while they’re still
chewing they scream at you. Shout
for more, tell you you’re wrong,
don’t even bother to say “thank
you.” Just eat, and whine until
you’re empty and done.

He POURS ANOTHER. Pushes it to Dan.
JACK (CONT'D)
Enough to make a man sick. And this
is the medicine. So tell me, pup.
You gonna take your medicine?
He waits. Dan leans back. Afraid.

DAN
I’m not --

122.

Jack SMASHES THE GLASS out of the way. The liquor FLIES OUT,

SPLASHING onto Dan’s shirt. Jack stares him down...
a warm smile appears, out of nowhere.

JACK
Oh! Look at that, I’m sorry, clumsy
old me, Mister Torrance. Forgive
me. Let’s get you cleaned up.

INT. OVERLOOK HOTEL, RED BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Dan looks up, DISORIENTED. He’s in the RED BATHROOM
his father leaning over the SINK and wetting a hand
moves to Dan, starting to wipe up the spill.

JACK
Management is concerned.

DAN
Concerned.

JACK
About the girl. In the car.

DAN
I’ll bet.

and then

suddenly,
towel. He
123.

JACK
Horrible, what she’s done to you.
Pulled you into her mess. A smart
man, he’d let her handle it. Let
things unfold as they’re meant to,
sit it out.

DAN
Management would do well to
understand... the girl is
protected.

JACK

Why should you pay her tab, Doc?
He looks into Dan’s eyes. The same darkness.

JACK (CONT'D)
I did it wrong. With you. I was
just trying to make you tough. Make
you a man I could be proud of.

DAN
I believe I am.

JACK
You messed up, Danny. Got two men
killed. Good men. Men who took a
stand. Fought. And for what? For
this little girl, who started all
this trouble. Pulled you, and them,
into her mess.

DAN
And what does management think I
should do about that?

JACK

(shrugs )
Nothing. Easiest thing in the world
to do, son. Bring her inside. And
then... well, accept the things you
cannot change. And you and I can
sit at the bar, have a drink.
That’s what you’ve always wanted,
isn’t it?

Dan stares at him. About to answer when --

ABRA (V.O.)
DAN!

He SNAPS to attention. Looking toward the door.
124.
ABRA (V.O.)
Dan, she’s here!

CUT TO:

EXT. OVERLOOK HOTEL - MOMENTS LATER

Abra climbs out of the car. Around her, the snow is FALLING
HARDER. Across the mountain, she watches as HEADLIGHTS CLIMB
the precarious mountain path.

She stares at the approaching RV, still a few minutes away.
Dan steps out of the front doors, walking toward her. She
points to the lights.

DAN
Okay.

He looks back at the hotel. Inside, MORE AND MORE LIGHTS are
on. He looks from the dark building to the approaching lights
on the road... danger to either side of him.

He holds out his hand, and Abra takes it.

INT. OVERLOOK HOTEL, LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

Dan and Abra step inside. Abra looks around the lobby.

ABRA
This place is sick. The same way my
Momo was sick... it’s cancer. Only

worse.
He turns, crouching down to her.

DAN
You should call your mom. Tell her
where you are. By the time she gets
here...

ABRA
It’ll be over.

DAN
One way or the other.

Abra CLOSES HER EYES. Concentrates. As she does... Dan
notices the LIGHTS SWELL in the lobby. Coming up to FULL
POWER. FEEDING OFF HER SHINE.

ABRA
Okay. Done. What do we do now?
125.
DAN
We head inside. She’ll find us.

They start walking toward the corridors. As Abra steps in,
Dan STOPS. Looking at something on the wall...

A FIRE AXE. IN A DIRTY GLASS CASE.

EXT. OVERLOOK HOTEL - MINUTES LATER

Rose steps through the snow, looking up at the hotel. The
lights FULLY BRIGHT inside, shining through the old boards
over the windows. THE HOTEL IS AWAKE.

INT. OVERLOOK HOTEL, LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER

Rose the Hat walks into the lobby of the Overlook Hotel. She
moves slowly, taking in her surroundings. Feeling the POWER
of the place.

She looks toward the elevators, and for just a moment -- sees
a FLASH of BLOOD, soaking the entire lobby. She smiles.

INT. OVERLOOK HOTEL, CORRIDORS - CONTINUOUS

Rose walks the corridors, past the closed doors. She RUNS HER
FINGERS along the walls, glancing down at the familiar CROSS-
PATTERN CARPETING as she goes deeper into the hotel.

INT. OVERLOOK HOTEL, COLORADO LOUNGE - MOMENTS LATER

Rose steps into the iconic COLORADO LOUNGE. Looking at the
OLD PIANO... the LONG DESK just beyond it, in the center of
the room. The desk with the OLD TYPEWRITER, rusted and dusty.

And beyond it... to the STAIRCASE. Where DAN stands, Abra at
his side. Waiting for her. Dan holding THE FIRE AXE.

ROSE
Well hi there.

Dan leans toward Abra.
DAN

(in Abra’s mind)
When this starts, you run.
126.

ROSE
Yes, you run, dear. Then I’1l find
you. And you’1ll scream for years
before you die.

ABRA
We'll see who does the screaming.

ROSE
We'll see indeed.

DAN
She's right, you know. You should
be afraid.

ROSE
Why is that?

DAN
You don’t know where you’re
standing.

ROSE
Who are you, handsome?

Dan doesn’t answer.

ROSE (CONT'D)
I get it, you’re scared. You should
be... you’re the man who killed my
Crow, aren’t you.

Dan nods.

ROSE (CONT'D)
The others too.

DAN
(to Abra)
Go.

In that moment, Rose GRABS HER EARS as a HIGH-PITCHED RINGING
erupts in her skull. The room GOES BLURRY, and she STUMBLES
to one knee. After a moment, she shouts --

ROSE
ENOUGH.

The sound of someone HITTING THE GROUND. Rose looks up, BLOOD
running from her nose. On the stairs, Dan is LYING ON HIS
SIDE, pushing himself back up. Abra is GONE, having run into
the hotel during his distraction.
127.

Rose gets to her feet, walking toward Dan as he rises,
picking up the axe.

ROSE (CONT'D)
How the hell did we miss you? You
and I should have met years ago,
Danny. That’s your name, isn’t it?

DAN
I was busy. So were you... busy
killing children.

ROSE
(shrugs )

Something happens to the steam,
when you rubes get older. It gets
dirty. Polluted. You know that, I
see the grease all over you. You
don’t “Shine” quite the same, do
you. Growing up spoils that, I
guess. But seriously, handsome,
where have you been hiding.

He raises the axe defensively as she STARTS CLIMBING THE
STAIRS. Slowly, STALKING him.

ROSE (CONT'D)
I can make you an offer. An offer I
rarely make.

DAN
Can’t wait.

Dan starts slowly BACKING UP THE STAIRS. Rose follows, and
they slowly climb... just as Jack and Wendy did years ago.

ROSE
Such a gifted boy. Hiding his light
under a bushel, for so long. You
could live a long, long time. Live
well, too. Indulge yourself. No
consequence. No hangovers. Live
long, eat well.

DAN
Must feel lonely. Being the last
one, I mean. Last one in the world.

ROSE
Oh sweetie, I’m not the last. Far
from it. I’m just the prettiest.

Dan reaches the top step. Rose looks up at him, smiling.
128.

DAN
I assume you know my answer.

ROSE
Pity.
(beat)
So are we doing this or not?

A long beat... and then a BLAST OF NOISE in Rose’s head. Dan
RUSHES toward her, RAISING THE AXE --

ANOTHER BLAST, THIS ONE IN DAN’S MIND --

HE FALTERS, SWINGING THE AXE DOWN TOWARD HER HEAD --

SHE CATCHES THE HANDLE, just below the blade, DEFLECTING IT --
INTO HER OWN SHOULDER.

She RIPS the blade out, RIPPING IT from Dan’s hands --

SWINGING IT DOWN, BURYING THE BLADE INTO HIS THIGH. She GRABS
HIM around the neck, HURLING HIM UP OFF HIS FEET, OVER HER
HEAD -- AND HURLS HIM DOWN THE STAIRS.

He lands HARD, bouncing from the stairs, landing at the
bottom with a THUD. His leg BLEEDING PROFUSELY.

Rose slowly descends the staircase, blood flowing from her
collarbone. Axe in hand. EYES BURNING WITH INHUMAN LIGHT. She
crouches over him. Looking at his wound.

ROSE (CONT'D)

Oh, sweetie. I seem to have nicked
your femoral artery. You’re gonna
bleed to death.

He tries to sit up, she SMASHES the back of the axe into his
HEAD, knocking him back. GRABS his throat. PUSHING HIM BACK
with INHUMAN STRENGTH. He’s OUTMATCHED.

ROSE (CONT'D)

My, my, what a temper you have. So
much fire. You sure I can’t tempt
you? Turn all that fire and steam
into a long, blessed life... or do
you want to die here on the floor?

DAN
We don’t die. We go on.
ROSE
Fair enough. Such a waste... or

Maybe not.
129.

She DIGS HER FINGERS into his leg wound, and he SCREAMS. She
tightens her grip on his throat, leaning close to him. Her
fingers DIG in the wound, and he SCREAMS LOUDER...

And then, a FAINT CLOUD OF GREY STEAM escapes his mouth.
Rising in the air. Rose greedily INHALES IT.

ROSE (CONT'D)
Damn, even at your age... it’s so
good. You taste like whiskey.

She DIGS IN HARDER, and Dan SCREAMS LOUDER. As he does --

FLASHES BEFORE HIS EYES: HIMSELF AS A CHILD. RUNNING,
TERRIFIED THROUGH THE HALLS. HIS FATHER, LIMPING AFTER HIM.
AXE IN HAND. THE WOMAN IN THE TUB, RISING.

Rose INHALES another breath of Dan’s steam.

ROSE (CONT'D)
So much terror, all your life.
Delicious. You do Shine - that’s
the word you like, isn’t it? And so
does the little bitch. But honey,
neither one of you can hold a
candle. To me.

She releases his neck, GRABBING HIS HEAD with fingers as
strong (and suddenly as sharp) as TALONS. She SQUEEZES HIS
SKULL as she DIGS MORE into his leg. Dan SCREAMS IN AGONY --

FLASHES: LITTLE DANNY, RUNNING THROUGH THE HEDGE MAZE. THE
WORD REDRUM, ON THE WALL. AND DARKNESS... A DARKNESS FULL OF
LOCKED BOXES, LIKE COFFINS.

Rose BREATHES IN MORE STEAM. Eyes blazing, ecstatic.
ROSE (CONT'D)
(realizing)
You’re not alone in there. What are
you hiding?
She SQUEEZES HIS HEAD HARDER. Dan SCREAMS --
FLASHES: LOCK BOXES, LIDS BANGING. THINGS TRYING TO GET OUT.

ROSE (CONT'D)
What’s in those? Something special?

DAN
You don’t know where you’re
standing.
130.

ROSE
You said that. What do you mean?

DAN
I mean you’re right. I Shine, and
Abra Shines even more than me. But
neither of us Shine as much as
you... and you’re standing in the
one place -- the worst place -- for
someone who Shines.

Rose looks at him, her smile fading as --
FLASH: THE LIDS OF THE BOXES ARE THROWN OPEN, ALL AT ONCE
He GRINS, and for a moment, it’s HIS FATHER’S GRIN.

DAN (CONT'D)
The things in those boxes aren’t
just special... they’re starving.

Rose looks down at him, not understanding -- and over her
shoulder, we see the rotten, EMACIATED FACE OF MRS. MASSEY.
GAUNT, STARVING. STARING AT ROSE --

MRS. MASSEY POUNCES. She KNOCKS ROSE TO THE FLOOR, and we
realize she ISN'T ALONE --

DOZENS OF GHOSTS DESCEND ON THEM. All SCREAMING WITH HUNGER,
faces GAUNT AND STARVING. We recognize most of them - HORACE
DERWENT. DELBERT GRADY. THE INHABITANTS OF THE OVERLOOK.

Rose SCREAMS as they CLIMB ONTO HER, desperate for FOOD --
CLAWING, DIGGING. Their hands DISAPPEAR INTO HER BODY. They
desperately DIG INTO HER, LOOKING FOR ANYTHING TO QUENCH
THEIR DECADES OF HUNGER --

Rose STRUGGLES. Fighting with everything she has to keep them
back, SCREAMING IN SURPRISE AND PAIN --

But it’s no use. The hollow eyes and gaping mouths of the
ghosts surround her, descending on her just as the True Knot
did to Bradley Trevor.

Rose looks one last time at Dan, FURY AND RAGE in her ancient
eyes. Unable to believe that she is beaten... by HIM.

He STARES HER DOWN. Holds eye contact, even as the ghosts
PLUNGE THEIR HANDS into her chest. One last look of hatred
from Rose --

AND THEN SHE STARTS TO CYCLE. Her skin becoming TRANSLUCENT,
we can see their GHOSTLY FINGERS INSIDE OF HER, PULLING AT
HER HEART, HER BLOOD --—
131.
She THRASHES BENEATH THEM, HER SKULL SHINING THROUGH HER
SKIN, TWISTING INTO THE INHUMAN MONSTER SHE TRULY IS --

She SCREAMS ONE LAST TIME, as STEAM BEGINS TO POUR OUT OF HER
MOUTH AND NOSE. The ghosts INHALING IT HUNGRILY --

And then she BURSTS APART in a cloud of silver STEAM. The
steam is ABSORBED by the inhabitants of the OVERLOOK, who
greedily GULP IT IN --

SOME OF IT ABSORBED BY THE VERY CARPET, being digested by the
hotel itself -- And then, she is gone.

The ghosts’ gaunt faces EXPAND, their features BECOMING
RESTORED, the years of starvation DISAPPEARING as they
inherit all of her strength.

Dan tries to SIT UP as they turn their attention to him. They
ADVANCE, GRINNING THEIR DEAD SMILES --

Dan CLOSES HIS EYES, CONCENTRATING --
A FLASH OF THE LOCK BOXES, he wants to LOCK THEM AWAY AGAIN --

But they are ON HIM before he can do anything. He STRUGGLES
in their grip, and as a DEAD HAND closes over his mouth --

WE SEE HIS EYES ROLL BACK WHITE as the Overlook POURS ITSELF
INTO HIS MIND.

INT. OVERLOOK HOTEL, CORRIDORS - MOMENTS LATER

Abra looks up as the LIGHT FIXTURES SWELL with new ENERGY.

From somewhere deep in the hotel, THE SOUND OF MUSIC. Old
music, ECHOING THROUGH THE HALLS. She slowly walks, SCARED.

ABRA
Uncle Dan?

Just the sound of music. She moves slowly, afraid, and turns
the corner to see -- TWO GIRLS, IN BLUE DRESSES. HOLDING
HANDS. STARING AT HER.

She STARES AT THEM. Terrified. The girls stare back, their
expressions BLANK...

As SOMEONE STEPS INTO THE HALL BEHIND ABRA. She turns at the
SHUFFLING SOUND of their entrance...

It’s DAN, head down. THE AXE IN HIS HANDS.
132.

ABRA (CONT'D)
Uncle Dan! Is it done? Is she
dead...

As Abra approaches, he LOOKS UP AT HER. She STOPS COLD.
It’s Dan... BUT IT ISN'T. His eyes are DARK. FULL OF
VIOLENCE. The same expression his FATHER wore, those years
ago, when he TRIED TO KILL HIS FAMILY.
ABRA (CONT'D)
(beat)
What’s wrong?

He stares at her... AND LIMPS FORWARD. CLUTCHING THE AXE.

DAN

Bad girl. Bad little pup...
ABRA

Uncle Dan...
DAN

You’re gonna take your medicine.

As he picks up speed, AXE AT THE READY. HE MEANS TO KILL HER.
She backs up, the realization hitting her -- THEN ABRA RUNS.

INT. OVERLOOK HOTEL, CORRIDORS - CONTINUOUS

Abra turns the corner, moving fast. Around her, the music
LOUDER NOW, the lights FLICKERING. Behind her, Dan LIMPS
FRANTICALLY along, Axe in his hand.

DAN
Abra!

She runs faster, rounding the corner. Makes it down a
familiar hallway... looking over her shoulder. She’s ahead of
him, but he’1l turn the corner any second --

She sees an open door. RUNS INSIDE. As she closes the door
behind her, we tilt up to the room number... ROOM 217.
INT. OVERLOOK HOTEL, ROOM 217 - CONTINUOUS

Abra slowly backs away from the door, into the familiar room.
The green walls are FADED, MOLDY. OLD.

Keeping quiet, she BACKS INTO THE ROOM. Waiting. She watches
as a SHADOW PASSES BY UNDER THE DOOR. Hears Dan’s LABORED
BREATHS as he looks for her.
133.
DAN (0.S.)
Abra!!!

After a few moments, he passes, and she listens to him
walking away.

Barely aware THAT SOMEONE IS IN THE BATHTUB IN THE OTHER
ROOM. Just over her shoulder.

The sound of WATER SLOSHING GENTLY turns her head. She turns
to see --

THE SILHOUETTE of a WOMAN, SITTING IN THE TUB. Her hand
slowly REACHING UP to pull the curtain back.

Abra watches as MRS. MASSEY peels back the curtain, GRINNING.
Abra STEELS herself against the vision. Holds her ground.

ABRA
Try it.

Mrs. Massey STANDS UP. Abra stands, waiting as --
THE DOOR IS SUDDENLY KICKED OPEN.

She spins back toward it as DAN STEPS INTO THE ROOM. AXE IN
HAND. GRINNING AT HER.

DAN
There you are. We have to talk,
Abra. You’ve been very, very bad.

ABRA
You’re not Uncle Dan.

He stops. Smiling at her.

ABRA (CONT'D)
You're a mask. A false face.

DAN
Who else would I be?
ABRA
You’re not him. You’re the hotel.

(beat)
But he’s still in there.

He smirks, and after a beat... lets the mask slip. The face
staring at her is Dan’s, but also something else. SOMETHING
DARK. SOMETHING OLD. SOMETHING THAT WANTS HER DEAD.
134.

DAN
Masks off, then. Anything else to
say? Are you sure you wouldn’t like
to run? A game of tag, perhaps? All
we have is time, you know. An
eternity of time. Or shall we end
it? Might as well. After all...
we're missing the party.

Abra SMILES at him.

DAN (CONT'D)
Why are you smiling?

ABRA
Because you don’t know where you’re
standing.

DAN

I know these halls like my own
face, child.

ABRA
I mean the body you're standing
in... the face you’re wearing.

That’s Dan Torrance, and you don’t
know him. You think he’s still a
little boy, and man oh man, are you
in for a surprise.

DAN
(laughs )
Dan Torrance. You mean the same Dan
Torrance who was just laying broken
at the foot of the stairs?

ABRA
I mean the Dan Torrance who made
one stop, as soon as he got here.
(beat)
To the boiler room.

Dan’s smile disappears. He didn’t know that... and we can see
the implication SCARES HIM. He LIFTS THE AXE, SWINGING IT
DOWN AT HER HEAD --

Abra HOLDS HER GROUND, DOESN’T EVEN FLINCH AS --

THE AXE STOPS. INCHES FROM HER HEAD.

Dan holds it, staring at her with a PERPLEXED EXPRESSION. AN

INTERNAL STRUGGLE HAPPENING before our eyes, his hands
SHAKING...
135.

She reaches up, GENTLY RESTING HER HAND ON HIS, just above
the axe blade. And then, after a long beat... Dan CLOSES HIS
EYES. Breathes in... and when he opens them, we see the
difference. IT’S DAN AGAIN. THE REAL DAN.

ABRA (CONT'D)
(smiling)
There you are.

DAN
You were supposed to run.

ABRA
I didn’t want to leave you...

Dan smiles, gently.

DAN
I'm right where I’m supposed to be.

ABRA
I knew you wouldn’t let it hurt me.
I could feel it.

DAN
(beat)
Abra... I can’t hold it back much
longer though. You have to run.
ABRA
No. I’m not going anywhere without
you.
DAN

I'll be right behind you. Have to
close the door behind us, right?

She stares at him, not sure if she believes it. He nods,
reassuring. And finally...

DAN (CONT'D)
Run.

Abra turns, RUNNING FROM THE ROOM. Dan holds his ground, his
gentle smile fading as the HOTEL REGAINS CONTROL.

His face is slowly overtaken by PANIC. “Dan” turns, DROPPING
THE AXE as he RUNS --
136.

INT. OVERLOOK HOTEL, BOILER ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

-- into the boiler room. Heads to the boiler, looking at the
GAGES -- THE STEAM PRESSURE IS ALREADY IN THE RED. Panicked,
he reaches up to grab the handles...

BUT HIS HANDS STOP. Inches from the wheel. His face contorts
in confusion. DAN, inside, trying to STOP HIS HANDS from
relieving the pressure...

DAN
(struggling)
Are you out?
INT. OVERLOOK HOTEL, LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER

Abra RUNS toward the door.

ABRA
Almost...

INT. OVERLOOK HOTEL, BOILER ROOM —- CONTINUOUS

Dan’s hands SHAKE over the boiler. His face contorted with
RAGE and anger...

With great effort, Dan manages to STEP BACK, AWAY FROM THE
BOILER. LOWERING HIS HANDS. Sitting back, WATCHING THE BOILER
OVERLOAD.

FLAMES ERUPT FROM THE PIPES.

He sighs, knowing it’s over... the fire can’t be stopped now.
He stands and watches, even as the flames SPREAD TOWARD HIM.

As they reach him, Dan CLOSES HIS EYES, EXHAUSTED BUT
VICTORIOUS. In the firelight, we see his weary SMILE as the
FIRE REACHES HIM.

EXT. OVERLOOK HOTEL - MOMENTS LATER

Abra stands in the snow, watching as FLAMES begin to erupt
from the hotel. She stares, helpless as they SPREAD.

ABRA
Come on Uncle Dan, get out of
there...

The FIRE SPREADS FAST... the old, rotten wood and plaster of
the hotel CATCHING QUICKLY. The flames BUILDING AND BUILDING
as the snow falls around her.
137.

ABRA (CONT'D)
Come on.

On the mountain pass, in the distance, she sees SIRENS from
the APPROACHING POLICE CARS. Her mother brought the cavalry.

She turns, looking as the FLAMES ENGULF THE HOTEL... GLOWING
IN THE SNOW. The fire so large now, bursting through windows.

Abra waits, and waits. A TEAR rolling down her cheek.
Desperate for him to be safe. For it to be over. She waits...
and waits...

As the police cars reach the top of the pass.

ABRA (V.O.)
The fire spread fast. Destroying
the hotel... purifying it.

CUT TO:

INT. ABRA'S HOUSE, ABRA'S ROOM - ANOTHER NIGHT, WEEKS LATER
Abra sits on the foot of her bed.

ABRA
Burning so bright I was warm, even
in the snow. I could almost hear it
screaming. I could hear it dying.
And I knew, somewhere deep
inside... I knew you were okay.

REVEAL DAN. Leaning against the wall. Smiling at her.

DAN
I’m sorry I put you in danger. It
was the only way.

ABRA
I know.
(beat)
Do you think she was right? When
she said she wasn’t the last one.
Do you think there are more,
somewhere out there?

Dan considers this, moving toward the window. Looking out the
mountains in the moonlight.

DAN
The world is a hungry place. A dark
place.

(MORE )
138.

DAN (CONT'D)
And maybe there’s more of them, or
things like them, or worse. But
there are more people like you too.
People who stand.

She smiles at him. He looks out at the mountain. The snow at
the peak, against the night sky.

DAN (CONT'D)
You know what Rene Daumal said
about mountains? “What is above
knows what is below, but what is
below does not know what is above.
One climbs, one sees. One descends,

one sees no longer... but one has
seen.”

(beat)
They really are lovely, aren’t
they.

He turns back to her, the mountain behind him.

DAN (CONT'D)
I told you, when we first met... I
told you that you should hide, keep
your head down. Keep your Shine out
of sight. I was wrong about that.
(beat)
Shine on, Abra Stone. You Shine on.

She smiles. In the hallway, Lucy approaches.
LUCY
Abra! Dinner time!
(stepping in)
Who are you talking to?
REVEAL: The room is empty. Abra sits alone.
ABRA
No one.
INT. ABRA’S HOUSE, UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
Abra stops at the end of the hall. Lucy turns back to her.
ABRA
That’s not true. I lied, just now.

I was talking to Dan.

LUCY
How?
139.

ABRA
We go on. After. We go on. And he’s
okay, mom. He really is.

LUCY
(beat)
Good.

She heads down the stairs. Abra waits, watching her go. After
a few beats... she turns, toward the BATHROOM AT THE END OF
HER HALL. She stares at it.

LUCY (CONT'D)
You coming?

Through the door, in the dark... we see the SHADOW OF THE
WOMAN, SITTING IN THE TUB. BEHIND THE CURTAIN. MRS. MASSEY,
come for Abra. As she did for Danny, years ago.

ABRA
In a minute.

She turns, walking down the hall. Relaxed. She steps into the
bathroom, and slowly turns to CLOSE THE DOOR behind her. As
she does, ABRA SMILES.

FADE TO BLACK.
