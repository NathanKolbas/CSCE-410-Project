“LET ME IN”
BLACK SCREEN
We HEAR the DREADFUL MOANING and HOWLING of ARCTIC WIND.
FADE IN very slowly, TO DISCOVER we are HIGH ABOVE:
A SNOWY, RURAL LANDSCAPE - NIGHT

An empty TWO-LANE HIGHWAY snakes through massive pines;
MOUNTAINS loom in the distance. A BLIZZARD rages all around.

HOLD.

HAZY GLOWS of FLASHING RED and BLUE LIGHT suddenly appear,
way down the highway. It’s a SMALL MOTORCADE. We make out
two POLICE CRUISERS, an AMBULANCE. The wind is so fierce, we
can’t even hear the sirens yet.

Through the swirling VEIL OF SNOW, the image looks surreal;
it could almost be a painting... or a dream...

SMASH CUT TO:
THE MOTORCADE
SIRENS BLARING as they race through the blizzard.
THROUGH THE AMBULANCE WINDSHIELD

We SEE the HEAVY SNOW HURTLING toward us, obscuring the road
ahead. The STROBES from the roof periodically FLASH, and the
SNOWFLAKES suddenly appear to FREEZE in mid-air for a
blinding instant. It is completely disorienting. We HOLD on
this, as we HEAR TWO PARAMEDICS in the front seats (0.S.):

PARAMEDIC ONE (0.S.)
Jesus, I can’t see -- I can’t see a
fucking thing --

PARAMEDIC TWO (0.S.)
(into radio)
One three one to dispatch, come in!

IN THE BACK - QUICK, TIGHT SHOTS:
THREE MORE PARAMEDICS, wearing long RUBBER GLOVES work
feverishly on a completely naked PATIENT, whose face is

obscured from our view. The Unseen Patient THRASHES
VIOLENTLY as they work, in complete agony --

UNSEEN PATIENT’S POV - HANDHELD:

Twisting and turning, looking straight up at the Paramedics
as they struggle fiercely to hold him down --

PARAMEDIC THREE
Hold him down! Get his arms! Get
his arms!
The Unseen Patient GASPS and GAGS --
PARAMEDIC THREE
I need an irrigation lens and a

1000cc’s of saline -- !

PARAMEDIC FOUR

Got it!
As he reaches for the Patient’s eyes -- right at CAMERA --
the GASPING ACCELERATES -- AND --

THE PATIENT’S WRIST

swings up into FRAME, in panic -- it snaps short suddenly
with a CLANG! It is HANDCUFFED TO THE GURNEY.

UP FRONT
The RADIO CRACKLES to life as we watch the strobing blizzard:

RADIO (V.O.)
Go ahead one three one!

PARAMEDIC TWO (0.S.)
This is one three one! We have a
male, mid-fifties with burns over
nine to nine and a half percent of
his body! Prior to our arrival on
scene, patient apparently doused
his head, neck and face with some
sort of highly concentrated acid!
Patient’s airway is severely
compromised due to fume inhalation!
Vital signs unstable! Please
advise! Patient is a criminal
suspect! We’re coming in with a
police escort right now!

IN BACK
The Paramedics wrestle with the Unseen Patient --

PARAMEDIC FOUR
OK -- it’s in! The lens is in!

PARAMEDIC THREE
Irrigate!

UNSEEN PATIENT’S POV -- HANDHELD:

MORE EXCRUCIATING GASPING and CHOKING sounds as our view
FLOODS with SALINE -- the IMAGE LITERALLY RIPPLES -- and WE --

CUT TO:
A MOVING SHOT, DOWN A HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT
We're FOLLOWING ON THE BACK of a PLAINCLOTHES POLICEMAN as he
makes his way towards a HOSPITAL ROOM DOORWAY. As he
arrives, a PRIEST is on his way out. The Policeman stops,
allowing the Priest to pass. The Priest nods to him gravely.
We FOLLOW the PLAINCLOTHES POLICEMAN INTO:
THE DARK HOSPITAL ROOM
where a HEAVYSET NURSE attends to a bed on the other side of

the room, her body blocking our view of the Patient’s face.
She turns, hearing the Policeman; approaches. HUSHED TONES:

 

POLICEMAN
Can I talk to him?

NURSE
He can’t actually talk...

The Policeman LOOKS OFF SCREEN, past her, sees the Unseen
Patient for the first time; whatever he sees, it knocks the
wind out of him. He nods, utters under his breath, shaken:

POLICEMAN
I see. Jesus...
(then)
Alright, well... can I... just

have a few minutes?

The Nurse nods and leaves the room. The Policeman moves
toward the UNSEEN PATIENT’S BED slowly, apprehensive --

FROM THE UNSEEN PATIENT’S POV:

We finally get a CLOSE LOOK at the Policeman’s face as he
steps up. He’s mid-40s, with soulful but determined eyes. A
small town sense about him. From his haunted expression, you
get the feeling he’s never seen anything quite like this.
MACHINE NOISE surrounds us: A RESPIRATOR HISSES ominously...

Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library
The Policeman unzips his jacket, takes a POLICE NOTEBOOK out,
opens it, places it in front of the Unseen Patient; he takes
out a PEN, carefully places the Patient’s FINGERS around it.
Then he looks up, RIGHT INTO CAMERA, struggling a bit:

POLICEMAN
We, uh... We wanna know who you are.

Beat. His eyes drift down to THE PATIENT’S HAND, gripping
the pen. There is a fresh ACID SCAR across the top of it.
The hand remains perfectly still, no intention of writing...

POLICEMAN (CONT ’D)

We'll find out, you know. Sooner or
later. You could save us some
legwork by communicating with us now.

(beat)
I just got off the phone with the
Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Guess there’s an idea you been
involved in a whole lot more than
just what’s been going on around
here. Like maybe this all goes way
back. Other states. Other cities.

(stares at him)
Is that true?

(then)
Are you a Satanist? You in some
kind of cult? Coz if there are
others involved, we'll find them
too, believe me.

The PACE of the HEART MONITOR speeds up a bit. The Policeman
turns, noticing; he turns back, trying to gauge the reaction:

POLICEMAN (CONT ’D)
What’s the matter? Is that it? Is
there someone you wanna tell me
about? People you’re involved with?

(beat; then)
Look, I’m gonna be honest with you.
Your prognosis here... it’s not too

good. What you did, it’s a real...
shock to your system. There may not
be a lotta time left. So maybe...
Maybe you got some things here you
wanna tell me. Things that are
weighing heavy. On your heart.
Maybe you could write ‘em down for
me. Clear your conscience.

 

The Nurse appears again in the doorway:

NURSE
I’m sorry. The Nurse at reception
downstairs is on the phone. She wants
to talk to you. Says it’s urgent.

The Policeman turns to her, nods; then turns back, stares
INTO CAMERA, cautious, searching, wondering if maybe he is on
the verge of something here...

POLICEMAN
I’ll be right back... Okay?

He turns to go; and we CUT FOR THE FIRST TIME TO REVEAL:
THE PATIENT

Under bandages is a viciously acid-ravaged face -- almost
unrecognizable as human anymore. Haunted eyes stare out from

 

 

mangled flesh, gazing after the Policeman with a sense of
fear. After a beat, he looks down in front of him at:

 

 

THE POLICE NOTEBOOK

where his hand rests, holding the pen, motionless. We HOLD
FOR A VERY LONG BEAT. Finally, fingers trembling, he lifts

the pen, begins to WRITE...

 

NURSES STATION - MOMENTS LATER

The Policeman is on the phone. BEHIND HIM, RONALD REAGAN
silently gives a speech on TV -- the sound is off.

POLICEMAN
His daughter? When was this -- is
she still here...?

Suddenly, a BEEPING ALARM sounds from behind the station --
the heavyset Nurse checks the bank of patient monitors -- she
quickly starts for the suspect’s hospital room -- the
Policeman notices, growing concerned; we SLOWLY PUSH IN:

POLICEMAN
(into phone; distracted,
eyes following Nurse)
Well did she leave any information,
a phone number...?

The response on the phone suddenly focuses him again --
POLICEMAN (CONT ’D)
(into phone)

What do you mean a little girl?
How little...?

Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library
JUST THEN, a BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAM erupts (0.S.) from the
hospital room! The Policeman drops the phone and rushes --

BACK INTO THE HOSPITAL ROOM

WIND SWIRLS. The Nurse is standing next to the OPEN WINDOW,
horrified, her head in her hands. THE HOSPITAL BED IS EMPTY.

The Policeman moves over to LOOK --
OUT THE WINDOW:

THE PATIENT'S DEAD BODY LIES TWISTED SICKLY ON THE SNOW-
COVERED GROUND, TEN FLOORS BELOW!

 

POLICEMAN
(utters, breathless)
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph...

IN THE EMPTY BED

The POLICE NOTEBOOK lies open, it’s pages fluttering gently

in the wind. On top, written in the dead Patient’s TORTURED

SCRAWL are the words: “Abby... I’m sorry...” HOLD; then --
TIMECUT TO:

A WIDE TABLEAU SHOT OF THE FRONT OF THE HOSPITAL - NIGHT

We are INSIDE THE LOBBY, LOOKING OUT through massive GLASS

WINDOWS. POLICE CARS and FORENSIC TEAMS have gathered.

CRIMSON SNOW drifts serenely over everything, ILLUMINATED by

the SPINNING RED EMERGENCY LIGHTS on the vehicles.

A SMALL CROWD -- the Policeman included -- watches as the
Patient’s body is zipped into a body bag...

In the FOREGROUND, over this, we see AN OUT OF FOCUS IMAGE OF

RONALD REAGAN continuing his speech -- it’s a REFLECTION from
the LOBBY TV, on the window in front of the body. Down here
the sound is on -- it’s the “Evil Empire” speech:

RONALD REAGAN ON TV
There is sin and evil in the world,
and we’re enjoined by scripture and
the Lord Jesus to oppose it with all
our might. Our nation, too, has a
legacy of evil with which it must
deal. The glory of this land has
been its capacity for transcending
the moral evils of our past...

The Policeman lifts his hand -- there’s something in it: it’s
the POLICE NOTEBOOK; he stares at it... haunted...

SUPER the TITLE CARD: “LITTLETON, COLORADO. MARCH, 1983.”

A NURSE steps up behind the Policeman, starts to say
something, and just as he turns we:

CUT TO BLACK. THE SOUND WASHES AWAY INTO SILENCE.

 

HOLD.

After a long beat, we start to HEAR a CHILD’S VOICE, QUIETLY
SINGING; there’s something mournful about it... EERIE...

CHILD'S SINGING
Eat some now, save some for later...
Eat some now, save some for later...

ANOTHER SUPER TITLE FADES UP: “TWO MONTHS EARLIER...”
A DISTANT TRAIN HORN CRIES as we SLOWLY FADE IN TO REVEAL:
A TWELVE YEAR OLD BOY, HIS BACK TO US, SEATED ON A JUNGLE GYM

We're PUSHING IN ON HIM as he sings to himself, completely
hidden in a HOODED, METALLIC SILVER WINTER JACKET; BREATH
STEAMS around his head in the dim, blue TWILIGHT. SNOW
BLANKETS the ground underfoot. No one else is around.

As we CREEP CLOSER, the Boy reaches into his pocket, pulling
out candies, unwrapping them, and popping them into his
mouth, one by one, in a constant stream. The rhythm of his
song is periodically interrupted by the need to chew.

BOY
(singing absently, hushed)
Now and Later... the really tasty
treat... Now and Later... the
flavor can’t be beat...

Suddenly, a WOMAN’S VOICE ECHOES distantly:

WOMAN’S VOICE
Owwwwen...?

The Boy keeps on singing:
BOY
Look at all those...
(chews; then: )
..-pieces... Flavors that are wow...

Beat.

WOMAN’S VOICE
Owwwwen...?

Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library
We STOP in CLOSE UP on the BACK of the BOY’S HEAD -- and he
finally TURNS TO US, in the direction of the Woman’s Voice:
BOY
(annoyed, mouth full)

This is OWEN.

On the verge of thirteen, his face still has a delicate, pre-
adolescent androgyny. He looks innocent, almost fragile.

WOMAN’S VOICE
Dinner time, honey...!

As Owen gets up to go, he pulls a fistful of candy wrappers
from his pocket, dumps them on the ground, buries them in the
snow with his foot. CUT WIDE to SEE we are in:

A MASSIVE 1960'S ERA APARTMENT COMPLEX - COURTYARD - TWILIGHT

The jungle gym sits in a meager playground at the center of
the deserted courtyard. Tall buildings surround us. As Owen
trudges away through the snow toward his building we CUT TO:

LONG LENS CLOSE ON OWEN - AT THE DINNER TABLE - NIGHT

Owen sits, head bowed, holding his MOTHER’s hand as she says
grace in the F.G., SOFT FOCUS. HOLD on OWEN throughout:

OWEN’S MOTHER (0.S.)
Bless us O Lord, and these Thy gifts,
for which we are about to receive,
from Thy bounty, in the name of Jesus
Christ, our Lord, Amen.

As they release hands, Owen’s mother’s ARM reaches over,
pours Chablis into a WINE GLASS in the F.G. -- OWEN’S EYES
flit a bit anxiously to the glass as it FILLS...

OWEN’S MOTHER (0.S.)
How was school today?

Owen scrunches his face, shrugs a shoulder. She laughs:

OWEN’S MOTHER (0.S.)
That good, huh?

(notices he’s not eating)
Hey, what’s this -- you didn’t go
and spoil your dinner on me now,
did you? Owen? Sweetie, you
promised me...

He guiltily stabs a forkful of his Kraft mac and cheese:

OWEN
..-MNo... What? I didn’t...

The PHONE RINGS. She stands, and we FLEETINGLY GLIMPSE for
the first time she wears a POWDER BLUE NIGHTGOWN and ROBE --

OWEN’S MOTHER (0.S.)
Eat. Please, honey.

She musses his hair affectionately, EXITS FRAME, ANSWERS PHONE:

OWEN’S MOTHER (0.S.)
Hello?
(she quiets, darkens)
What. No, what?

Owen turns, watching her OFF-SCREEN with growing anxiety...

OWEN’S MOTHER (0.S.)
Look... Look, I’m not -- I’m not
gonna discuss this now, okay?
We're eating dinner.

Owen’s EYES discreetly FOLLOW as she reaches into FRAME, grabs
her WINE, then paces 0.S. -- the PHONE CORD stretches TAUT...

OWEN’S MOTHER (0.S.)

Well, we had an agreement, George.
Okay? We agreed...

(then)
You know what? I think maybe you
better call my lawyer, okay...? Yes.
Right. Because you know he’d never
let you get away with this shit.

(beat)

Don’t talk to me like that -- I will

not. Be spoken to. In that way!
(beat)

Okay, I’m going now, George, okay?
«What? He’1ll call you back.
We're eating, George.

She SIGHS, re-enters FRAME, holds out the phone:

OWEN’S MOTHER (0.S.)
Your father wants to talk to you...

OWEN
(into phone, uncomfortable)
Hello? ...Hi... I’m okay...

Owen steals a final look at the WINE GLASS as his mother sets
it down again in the F.G., RE-FILLS it...

10.

INT. OWEN’S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - NIGHT

Owen gingerly sets his plate in the sink, which is piled with
dirty dishes. He peeks THROUGH THE DOORWAY INTO:

THE DARKENED LIVING ROOM

Where his mother, partially obscured by the door jam, sits
with her wine glass, watching ranting televangelist, Dr. Gene
Scott on TV. We HEAR the sound of her CRYING.

Owen turns away, hopeless. He is about to go when he SEES:

A LARGE KITCHEN KNIFE

Lying on the counter. His eyes linger on it...
CUT TO:

INT. OWEN’S ROOM - NIGHT

A model of the SPACE SHUTTLE hangs from the ceiling. There’s
a TELESCOPE by the window. Posters of the planets. STAR
WARS toys. “Beth” by KISS plays softly from a cheap RADIO.

OWEN’S BARE FEET stalk slowly though the chaotic, clothes-
strewn mess on the floor... We HEAR his BREATHING...

CLOSE ON THE LARGE KITCHEN KNIFE
As it pierces the air, creeping forward threateningly...

OWEN (0.S.)
(very quiet, menacing)
Hey little girl...

REVEAL Owen as he steps up to his dresser MIRROR. He’s
stripped down to his underwear, holding the knife, and
wearing a PLASTIC, SEMI-TRANSPARENT HALLOWEEN MASK which
completely obscures his expression. It’s a disturbing image.

OWEN
(staring down his “victim”)
Are you a little girl...?

Just then a WOMAN’S SHRIEK echoes distantly. Owen turns as
LIGHT SPILLS onto his ceiling from outside his window. There's
a MAN'S VOICE too. Owen sets down the knife, moves to:

HIS WINDOW

Across the courtyard, framed in one of the other apartment

windows, a COUPLE, having just come home, are ARGUING
passionately. We can’t make out what they’re saying.

Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library
11.

They are LARRY and VIRGINIA, early 30s.

Owen watches them, motionless. He turns his telescope
towards them, cautiously presses his eye to the eyepiece...

THE TELESCOPE

FOCUSES on Virginia as she yells at Larry. She’s hot-tempered.
Has a somewhat trashy, small town sexiness. Larry tries to
calm her to no avail, reaches for her wrist; she pulls away.
At their feet, a tiny LAP DOG BARKS incessantly.

Owen just stares from behind the mask. Slowly BREATHING...
Finally, he turns the telescope... starts to peep into other
windows... He finds:

A FORTY-ISH, SHIRTLESS MAN (JACK)

lying on a BENCH in his cramped living room, lifting weights.
His CHEST is OVERLY DEVELOPED.

Owen pulls his eye from the telescope, pushes up his mask.
He looks down at his own scrawny chest, ashamed. Then he
notices something: the courtyard is QUIET again. He looks
up, swings the telescope back toward:

LARRY AND VIRGINIA’S APARTMENT

Virginia has calmed. Larry, contrite, rubs her arm
apologetically... He tries to kiss her, but she turns away.
He touches her face, tries again; grudgingly, she lets him...

Owen watches with morbid fascination as the KISS builds...
turns SEXUAL, as Virginia gives in... Larry starts to grope
her, reaches into her shirt, exposing her breast, WHEN --
VIRGINIA’S STARTLED EYES SUDDENLY MEET THE TELESCOPE --

 

OWEN backs away, terrified -- ducks behind his curtain. He
stands there frozen, heart racing. HOLD.

Finally, he PEEKS back: Virginia is closing the drapes.
Humiliated, Owen starts to turn away when he SEES --

A SILHOUETTED U-HAUL MOVING TRUCK

RUMBLE into the driveway between buildings. A FIGURE climbs
out, disappears behind the truck. After a moment, he re-
emerges, struggling with SEVERAL VERY LARGE SUITCASES along
the passenger side.

He stops, looks up into the cab, panting, his breath misting

up into the freezing air. He waits. Finally, ANOTHER MUCH
SMALLER FIGURE emerges, climbing down. Owen LOOKS:

12.

THROUGH THE TELESCOPE

It is A TWELVE YEAR OLD GIRL. Wrapped in a dark poncho, she
has mysterious, somewhat coarse features, like a gypsy. She
doesn’t even acknowledge the Figure waiting beside her. She
just starts into the courtyard.

The Figure -- a BALDING, WEARY MAN IN HIS MID-FIFTIES --
finally follows with the heavy luggage, looking almost like
her servant. Or maybe her father.

Owen watches as they make their way toward his building. As
they get close, he notices something through the telescope --
despite the snowy ground, THE GIRL IS COMPLETELY BAREFOOT.

Owen cranes to look straight down out his window, as, right
below him, the pair disappear into the entrance to his building.

CUT TO:
A NARROW VIEW THROUGH OWEN’S PARTIALLY OPENED FRONT DOOR
We look out at a STAIRWELL at the end of the EMPTY HALL.
Approaching FOOTSTEPS ECHO. Just as the TOP of the GIRL’S
HEAD starts to appear, climbing up the stairs --
OWEN quickly and quietly SHUTS his front door. He waits,
pressed against the front door as the MUFFLED FOOTSTEPS grow
LOUDER. Finally, he gets the courage to PEEK --
THROUGH THE PEEPHOLE

Just as the Girl and the Man pass, distorted and obscured by
the LENS’ FISHEYE EFFECT. We HEAR OWEN BREATHING RAPIDLY...

EXT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

The DOOR SLOWLY OPENS a crack, and OWEN peers cautiously out
to SEE the BALDING MAN, setting down the luggage, starting to
open the door to the apartment RIGHT NEXT DOOR.

Owen stares down again at the Girl’s bare feet as she waits,
her face turned away. Finally, she steps inside. The
Balding Man picks up the luggage, steps in after her.

INT. OWEN’S ROOM - NIGHT

Owen lies on his bed, eating Now and Laters, LISTENING to the
SOUNDS of his new neighbors coming through the wall. There’s
a STRANGE, EERIE GROANING... a RHYTHMIC SCRAPING...

We MOVE IN ON OWEN as he leans close to the wall, trying to
make out the INTENSE SOUNDS with a building sense of dread...

13.
We’re CLOSE on HIS WIDE OPEN EYES when we hear a SUDDEN LOUD
BANG FROM THE WALL -- and we FLASHCUT TO A HAUNTING VISION:
AN AQUA BLUE FIELD -- VERY SHALLOW FOCUS

CRIMSON-COLORED CLOUDS BILLOW and GROW disturbingly -- it
looks like BLOOD POURING into PURE, CLEAR BLUE WATER...

We HOLD -- THEN SEE THREE LIGHTENING FAST CUTS OF TIGHT SHOTS:
-- FLESH TEARS -- !

— VICIOUS DEMONIC EYES STARE -- !
-- BLOOD SPRAYS -- !

 

OWEN GASPS, sits up with a START! CUT WIDE to REVEAL we are:
INT. OWEN’S ROOM —- MORNING

Owen sits in bed, in exactly the spot we left him last night,
having just awakened from a nightmare. He starts to get his
bearings, looks around him at the room in the morning light.
Finally, he stares at the wall. Everything is quiet now.

EXT. APARTMENT COURTYARD - MORNING

Owen steps out of his building wearing his heavy jacket and a
BACKPACK. He starts across the courtyard when he SPOTS: A
BARE FOOTPRINT in the snow. He turns back, looks up... in_
the apartment next to his, the WINDOWS have been COMPLETELY
BOARDED UP from the inside with NEWSPAPER AND CARDBOARD.

 

 

As he stares, we start to hear:
CHILDREN’S VOICES
I pledge allegiance... to the flag...
of the United States of America...
INT. OWEN’S MIDDLE SCHOOL HOMEROOM - MORNING
We’re MOVING PAST about 30 STUDENTS, giving the pledge:
STUDENTS (CONT’D)
And to the Republic... for which it
stands...

FIND OWEN, hand over his heart, reciting with the others --

STUDENTS (CONT’D)
One Nation... under God...

SPLAT! A huge SPITBALL slaps onto Owen’s jacket. He turns

to see one of the students smiling cruelly. This is KENNY.
Resigned, Owen starts to scrape the mess off, and we CUT TO:

14.

INT. INDOOR MIDDLE SCHOOL POOL - MORNING

Pre-class chaos. KIDS IN BATHING SUITS scream, splash, push
each other into the pool. Still fully dressed, Owen walks up
behind his Serbian P.E. teacher, MR. ZORIC, says meekly:

OWEN
Mr. Zoric...?

Mr. Zoric turns, sees Owen is not in his bathing suit:

MR. ZORIC
Owen -- c’mon, serious... again?
OWEN

I have a cold. My mom wrote me a note.

He holds out THE NOTE: clearly in Owen’s own handwriting,
misspellings and all, it reads: “PLEASE EXSCUSE OWEN FROM
SWIMING. HE HAS A COLD.”

Mr. Zoric stares at Owen for a long beat; takes pity on him:

MR. ZORIC
Okay. Go sit in bleecher.

Owen sits, looks out at THE POOL, a bit miserably, SEEING:
KENNY

who, along with TWO COHORTS, circles and accosts a GIRL WITH
VERY DEVELOPED BREASTS; the boys keep disappearing under the
water, grabbing at her. She backs away, shriek/laughing
uncomfortably, when Kenny appears behind her and undoes the
strap on her bikini with a tug -- she grabs it before it can
fall, SCREAMS for Mr. Zoric at the top of her lungs -- Mr.
Zoric turns, sees Kenny laughing hysterically --

MR. ZORIC
Okay, Kenny! Ten laps! Now!

KENNY
I didn’t do anything...!

MR. ZORIC
Now! Or I make it twenty!

Kenny pounds the water with his fist, and, as Zoric turns
away, the Girl SOCKS him INCREDIBLY HARD in the arm. Owen
can’t help but smile -- but it’s unfortunate timing, because
at just that moment, Kenny feels Owen’s stare, turns -- Owen
stops smiling abruptly, averts his eyes, wishing he were
invisible; but sadly, he’s not. Kenny glares, and we CUT TO:

INT. POOL LOCKER ROOM —- MORNING

Owen spins the tumbler on his locker as fast as he can -- he
pops it open, quickly grabs his backpack when he HEARS --

VOICE (0.S.)
Hey little girl...

Owen turns to see Kenny and his friends (DONALD and MARK)
surrounding him, still dripping in their suits. Kenny is
twirling a wet towel into a whip -- he SNAPS it suddenly into
Owen’s face --

OWEN
(recoiling in pain)
Ow! Don‘t...!
KENNY
Are you a little girl...?
He SNAPS it viciously again -- Owen bends over, covering his
face, trying to protect himself -- as Kenny moves in closer --
KENNY

That’s why he won’t go swimming --
he doesn’t want everyone to see what
a little fucking girl he is --

Desperate, Owen tries to make a break for it -- but they grab
him, wrestle him violently to the ground -- he starts to
scream, but Kenny covers his mouth -- Owen GASPS for air --

OWEN’S POV - HANDHELD:

As he flails in panic -- Kenny giggles sadistically --
KENNY
Hold him down! Get his arms! Get
his arms!

As they do, Kenny reaches under the waistband of Owen's
pants, seizes his UNDERWEAR, YANKS it upwards, slowly
STRETCHING it into a brutal WEDGIE --

Owen SQUIRMS FRANTICALLY for an excruciating moment, until
suddenly a PUDDLE starts to GROW on the ground by his legs --
DONALD realizes, repulsed -- backs off --

DONALD

Dude, shit! I think he pissed
himself!

16.

KENNY
(laughing out of control)
~! Shit...!

Oh..

 

DONALD
(wiping himself with his
towel, horrified)
He fucking pissed himself!

The three of them scramble up -- Mark checks to see if he is
soiled too -- he kicks Owen’s side in disgust --
MARK

Jesus! Fucking freak!

Owen just lies there, as they head off -- Kenny’s

uncontrollable LAUGHTER ECHOES. A few CLASSMATES stare down

at Owen, askance, changing at their lockers.

Owen gets up slowly, picks his backpack off the ground...
CUT TO:

OWEN’S HAND GRABBING FIVE PACKS OF NOW AND LATER CANDIES

from a huge candy display -- WE ARE:

INT. LITTLETON VIDEO ARCADE - LATE AFTERNOON

Owen waits in line at the pay counter. The after school
crowd is here, and the DIN from the games is DEAFENING.

Owen looks over at a TENTH GRADE COUPLE making out by the MS.
PAC-MAN machine, their tongues deep in each other’s mouths.
Owen stares, when suddenly he BARELY HEARS the VOICE of the
SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD COUNTERMAN calling him over the cacophony.

Embarrassed, Owen places his candy and a TWENTY DOLLAR BILL
on the glass counter. As the Counterman grabs the money,

Owen NOTICES something in the COUNTER DISPLAY CASE below it --
an OPEN PEN KNIFE among some knickknacks; HIS EYES FIX ON IT.

 

EXT. APARTMENT COURTYARD - TWILIGHT

Owen sits on the jungle gym with his new PEN KNIFE. He unwraps
a candy, STABS it with the knife, puts it in his mouth --

OWEN
(singing, mouth full)
Eat some now, save some for later...

A metal DOOR THUDS shut -- Owen quiets, turns to see:

THE BALDING MAN

having just exited his building. Owen watches as the Man
sets down a DUFFLE, vainly attempting to light a cigarette in
the wind with his BIC LIGHTER -- “FLIT--FLIT--FLIT...” The
Man’s eyes drift up, suddenly feeling Owen’s gaze --

The two STARE at each other for an eerie, suspended moment.

 

Owen attempts a smile; but the Balding Man just picks up the
duffle, starts out toward the street -- we WATCH FROM:

A VERY HIGH SHOT, LOOKING STRAIGHT DOWN OVER THE COURTYARD
Owen remains motionless on the jungle gym, watching him go...
HOLD.

Then, just as Owen finally starts to quietly resume singing --

OWEN
Eat some now, save some for --

WE SMASH CUT TO:
EXT. WAL-MART PARKING LOT - LONG LENS SHOT - NIGHT

HOLD on the quiet, mostly deserted lot, bathed in sodium

vapor light... AFTER A BEAT, we SEE some BLURRY MOVEMENT in
the F.G. -- we HEAR the familiar “FLIT-FLIT-FLIT” of the BIC
LIGHTER again; SMOKE rises INTO FRAME, and we realize we are
now WATCHING from the BALDING MAN’S POV, over his shoulder...

 

A BEATEN-UP DATSUN B-210 pulls into the lot, parks. A BARELY
SIXTEEN YEAR OLD KID gets out, heads toward the store...

HEAR a LONG EXHALE; a STREAM OF SMOKE blows into F.G. view...
CUT TO:

THE DATSUN’S DRIVER DOOR

Seen from the shoulders down, the Balding Man’s GLOVED HANDS

slide a tow truck driver’s “SLIM JIM” down the car’s window

and into the door, DIGGING... until... the DOOR LOCK POPS UP.
CUT TO:

INT. DATSUN - MOMENTS LATER

Total STILLNESS, QUIET. We’re in back, looking toward the
empty parking lot through the windshield.

18.
The SIXTEEN YEAR OLD approaches. We HEAR the VERY FAINT
sound of BREATHING... from somewhere in the car...
HOLD as the Kid gets in, starts the engine, drives out...

After a few moments, we NOTICE something BLURRY moving very
subtly in the F.G.; the Kid does not... CUT AROUND TO:

THE REVERSE ANGLE
past the Kid as he drives. Right behind him, just visible in

shadow, is a FIGURE (the Balding Man) in a primitive looking
CLOTH MASK with the eyes cut out. The Figure WAITS,

 

motionless, poised, for a very long, disturbing beat... We
HEAR a PASSING TRAIN getting CLOSER... LOUDER...
Then, as the Kid brakes -- a TRAIN HORN BLARES -- and the

Figure LUNGES forward, JAMS the gear shaft into park with one
gloved hand -- uses the other to MASH a WET COTTON PAD over
the startled Kid’s nose and mouth! It’s messy, brutal --

CLOSE ON the FIGURE’S IMMOBILE, MASKED HEAD as the KID FLAILS
MADLY (0O.S.)! The utter terror in the Kid’s muffled SCREAMS
is excruciating -- like the primal squeal of an animal
experiencing the sudden, incomprehensible realization it is
being slaughtered. It goes on way too long. Finally, he
QUIETS; from behind the mask we hear HEAVY, RAPID BREATHING --
as the breathing starts to slow, we CUT TO:

HIGH ANGLE - OUTSIDE THE CAR - AT A TRAIN CROSSING

AN AMTRAK TRAIN finishes passing in front of the Datsun,
stopped on a sleepy, two lane road; no other cars are around.
The CROSSING GATES LIFT, but the car doesn’t move... CUT TO:

THE ABANDONED DATSUN - LATER

On a SECLUDED, MOUNTAIN ROAD; the driver door is ajar. PAN
SLOWLY to a SNOWY HILLSIDE WOOD beside the road. We HEAR
RUSTLING SOUNDS from within the TREES up the steep incline...

IN THE WOOD

Partially OBSCURED BY TREES, we SEE the SIXTEEN YEAR OLD KID
SUSPENDED BY HIS FEET on a ROPE, SLUNG over a TREE BRANCH.
Now in a CLEAR, PLASTIC RAIN SLICKER, still wearing his mask,
the Balding Man finishes hoisting the boy’s body, pulling the
rope with all his strength, grunting, panting hard --

CLOSE ON the DUFFLE: The Man reaches in, pulls out a FOLDING

HUNTING KNIFE(looking a lot like a much scarier version of
Owen’s pen knife), a LARGE, PLASTIC JUG, and a FUNNEL...

19.

CLOSE PROFILE ON the UP-SIDE-DOWN, SILHOUETTED HEAD of the
BOY: BREATH steams gently from his nostrils; he is still
alive, but heavily sedated. The Man ENTERS FRAME, crouched
on his knees, moves in close to the Boy’s face. He opens the
knife, presses it delicately against the Boy’s neck -- then,
all at once, THRUSTS the knife upward, PUNCTURING an artery!
We watch in SILHOUETTE as BLOOD DRAINS in a THICK, THROBBING
STREAM... TIP DOWN to see it FILLING the PLASTIC JUG below.

 

Nearby FOOTSTEPS CRUNCH in the snow -- startled, the Man
turns to see A DEER, watching him. They stare at each other.

TIMECUT TO:
THE WOOD - MINUTES LATER
The Man is carefully re-packing his duffle. He has removed
the cloth mask; his face is red, sweaty, his eyes have a far
away look. He looks numb. Bitter.
He reaches down, picks up the plastic jug, now filled with
blood. Walking back toward the duffle, he gently pulls the
funnel out of the jug, just starts to screw on a lid WHEN --
HIS LEG SINKS SHARPLY through the snow into a hole hidden
below -- he loses balance, DROPS the JUG -- it goes TUMBLING
DOWN the HILLSIDE -- ! He scrambles up, and runs lamely down
the hill after it; he EMERGES ONTO --
THE SNOWY MOUNTAIN ROAD
near the Boy’s abandoned car. The mostly EMPTY JUG sits on
its side in the street, BLOOD POOLING around it. The Man
stares at it, devastated, out of breath, in pain, AS --
DISTANT HEADLIGHTS
appear way down the road -- the Man turns to see A SNOW PLOW
heading this way. Panicked, he hobbles over, grabs the jug,
and clambers back up the hill, DISAPPEARING into the woods
OVER THIS we HEAR as HUSHED, MENACING VOICE:

VOICE (OWEN)
What’s the matter? Are you scared?

CUT TO:
EXT. APARTMENT COURTYARD - NIGHT

Owen stands, holding his OPEN PEN KNIFE threateningly,
staring at something OFF-SCREEN:

OWEN
Are you scared, little girl? Huh?

Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library
20.

As he lunges forward with the knife, we PAN with him to

reveal his “victim” -- A TREE. He THRUSTS his knife into the

bark with all of his might. Again. And again. Finally, he
stops. As he catches his breath, he suddenly feels a chill,
as if someone is there -- he turns to see:

THE NEW NEIGHBOR GIRL, standing on the jungle gym, watching
him, expressionless. Up close, her face looks tired, a
bit... malnourished. Her hair looks like it hasn’t been
washed in a very long time. Her clothes look old, ill-
fitting, like they could have come from the Good Will.

GIRL
What are you doing?

OWEN
(suddenly embarrassed)
Nothing.
(then)
What are you doing?

GIRL
Nothing.

Beat. Owen tries to make conversation:
OWEN
You guys just moved in, didn’t you?
Upstairs.

She looks at him.

GIRL
How do you know?

OWEN
I live next door.
(points)
Right there.

Pause. Finally, she nods. Jumps down from the jungle gym.

GIRL
Just so you know, I can’t be your
friend.

OWEN

...Why? What do you mean?

GIRL
Does there have to be a reason?
That’s just the way it is.

And she goes. He watches her, for a stunned beat. Then:

OWEN
Well who said I wanted to be your
friend...?!

But she’s already gone into the building.
INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE OWEN’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Owen sticks his key in the front door lock when he hears
FOOTSTEPS coming up the stairwell; they have an ODD CADENCE.
Owen turns as the Balding Man appears, LIMPING up the steps
with his duffle. Their eyes meet briefly. Then Owen opens
his door, disappears inside.

The Man continues towards us; as he passes Owen’s door, he
STOPS for a moment, stares at it... then moves on; CUT TO:

THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR

Owen has his eye pressed to the peephole, breathing through
his mouth, trying to be very quiet. He slowly backs away,
LISTENING to the Man’s IRREGULAR FOOTSTEPS... the door next
door CREAKS OPEN... then THUDS SHUT.

INT. OWEN’S ROOM - NIGHT

Owen is taking off his jacket, when he starts to hear
MUFFLED, INDECIPHERABLE YELLING coming through the wall from
the neighbors’ apartment. He jumps slightly as he hears a
SUDDEN, STIFLED CRASH, and a THUD. The YELLING CONTINUES.

Concerned, Owen moves apprehensively toward the wall, PRESSES
HIS EAR TO IT... The yelling becomes a bit more intelligible
-- but it is not clear whose voice it is -- there’s something
unsettling, almost FEROCIOUSLY INHUMAN about it -- maybe it’s

just acoustics, or the way it distorts through Owen’s wall:

VOICE (THROUGH WALL)
(near-hyperventilation)
..-SUPPOSED TO DO? AM I SUPPOSED
TO GO OUT AND DO IT MYSELF?! HUH?!
(long pause; then:)
SAY SOMETHING!!!

Owen listens, on pins and needles, as the argument goes
SILENT for a LONG MOMENT... we can just barely make out
someone HYPERVENTILATING...

HOLD.

Then, finally, we CUT TO:

22.

THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WALL

We are CLOSE on the Balding Man, who sits at a table, looking
down, quietly despondent; all of the gear from his duffle --
including the empty, blood-stained jug -- is scattered across
the floor behind him like it has been hurled there. We are
shooting PAST THE ARM of an OUT OF FOCUS FIGURE (could it be
the GIRL???), standing in FOREGROUND -- the Figure is
HYPERVENTILATING, waiting for a response.

The Balding Man glances up at the Figure, then looks down
again, bitterly ashamed. Finally, almost inaudibly, he says:

BALDING MAN
..-Forgive me.

Exasperated, the Figure STORMS OFF, WIPING THROUGH FRAME...
We CUT BACK TO:

OWEN

his ear still against the wall, anxiously waiting for more.
But nothing more comes. As he edges away from the wall, we --

CUT TO:
A MOVING SHOT, DOWN A CROWDED MIDDLE SCHOOL HALLWAY - MORNING

We're WITH OWEN as he passes through THRONGS of ARRIVING

STUDENTS -- there’s a HUSHED EXCITEMENT coursing through the
crowd, something is going on... Up ahead, Owen sees kids

gathering in CLUSTERS outside the ADMINISTRATION OFFICE,
whispering to each other, spying into the windows --

As Owen reaches them, he PEERS, with the others, INTO THE
OFFICE WINDOWS: in the waiting area are several UNIFORMED
POLICE OFFICERS. Their expressions are grave. One talks to
a woman who looks like she could be the PRINCIPAL. Behind
the counter, SECRETARIES are crying.

A MAN’S VOICE interrupts, from behind the kids:

MAN'S VOICE
‘Scuse me, fellas -- can I get
through here?

Owen turns -- IT’S THE SMALL TOWN PLAINCLOTHES COP FROM THE
OPENING OF THE FILM. The group parts to let him into the
office -- as he passes, we HEAR:

 

PRINCIPAL (V.O.)
As some of you may have heard, there
was an incident last night, and one

of our recent graduates was killed...

23.

Owen watches as our POLICEMAN steps up to the Principal -- the
other Cop turns, introduces them; he shakes her hand, CUT TO:

INT. MIDDLE SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - MORNING

The ENTIRE STUDENT BODY listens to the PRINCIPAL as she speaks
at a podium. The PLAINCLOTHES POLICEMAN stands behind her
with the other UNIFORMED COPS and VARIOUS FACULTY on stage.

PRINCIPAL (CONT’D)
I know many of you knew Scottie. He
was a bright, funny student, and a real
group leader who many of you knew from
his continuing involvement with our
Young Life Christian association...

ON OWEN, in the crowd, his backpack cradled in his lap:

PRINCIPAL (CONT’D)
The police assure me that everything
possible is being done to find those
responsible for this tragedy, but in
the mean time, we should all be on the
lookout for any suspicious activity...

Owen HEARS a STRANGLED LAUGH -- he peeks behind him to see
KENNY, MARK and DONALD, a couple rows back; they’re quietly
joking around, unmoved by the proceedings. Donald suddenly
glances in Owen’s direction -- Owen quickly turns away, SLINKS
DOWN in his seat, hiding from their view --

PRINCIPAL (CONT’D)
Your safety is our number one concern.

CUT TO:
A FRONT PAGE NEWSPAPER ARTICLE ABOUT THE MURDER
The HEADLINE: “LOCAL TEEN BRUTALLY SLAIN IN WOODS”. There’s
a yearbook PHOTO of Scottie Tate; a SUB-HEADLINE: “Victim
drained of blood, Police suspect ritual killing”. SCISSORS

 

lay by the article; it’s been cut out. WE ARE:

INT. OWEN’S ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

Owen sits on the floor, by the newspaper, opening a NOTEBOOK,

packed with clippings, scraps of paper... We HEAR OWEN’S

MOM'’S MUFFLED VOICE from the other room; she’s very upset:
OWEN’S MOTHER (0.S.)

I want you to come straight home
after school, okay...?!

Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library
24.

Owen ignores her, turning the pages of his notebook. INSIDE
are OTHER ARTICLES he’s collected -- GRISLY NEWS STORIES...
MURDERS... ASSASSINATIONS... SERIAL KILLINGS...

OWEN’S MOTHER (0.S.)
And I don’t want you going outside
the complex when you get home
either -- not until they catch this
guy! Stay in the courtyard...! Do
you hear me...?!

 

In the book, Owen’s eyes linger on his own CRUDE SKETCH of a
PLAN TO BLOW UP THE SCHOOL -- and a few CHILD-LIKE DRAWINGS
OF BLOODY, SEVERED HEADS, with names scrawled underneath:
“KENNY”, “MARK”, “DONALD”; he smiles.

OWEN’S MOTHER (0.S.)
Finally, Owen finds an empty page -- he slips the new article
into it, closes the book, satisfied. He gets up, goes to his
desk, is about to put the notebook in an open drawer when he
glances OUT THE WINDOW AT:
THE COURTYARD
He stares at the EMPTY JUNGLE GYM for a beat, WHEN SUDDENLY --

Owen’s Mother’s voice grows LOUDER, like she’s approaching --

OWEN’S MOTHER (0.S.)
I want you to promise me, honey --

We HEAR the sound of her trying to open Owen’s locked door --
OWEN’S MOTHER (0.S.)
Hey... what’s --
(KNOCKS on door, HARD)
Owen?!

Owen quickly buries the notebook deep in the drawer, grabs
the cut up newspaper on the floor, hides it under his bed --

INT. HALL OUTSIDE OWEN’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

THE DOOR OPENS -- we’re shooting LONG LENS past OWEN’S
MOTHER, SOFT FOCUS in the F.G. She’s in her blue robe, a
half-full WINE GLASS dangles from her hand -- OWEN SEES IT.

OWEN’S MOTHER (0.S.)
What are you doing...?

OWEN
Nothing.

Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library
25.
OWEN’S MOTHER (0.S.)
Well, did you hear me -- ?

OWEN
Yes!

OWEN’S MOTHER (0.S.)

Okay...

(quiets, softening)
I just... I don’t want anything to
happen... To my baby...

She starts to CRY. Owen immediately feels bad. He moves to
her slowly, hugs her... We CONTINUE TO STAY ONLY ON HIM, as
he speaks softly, trying to comfort her as she begins to SOB:

OWEN
It’s okay, Mom... Don’t worry...
(then, even quieter: )
I‘ll just stay in the courtyard...
I always stay in the courtyard...

OWEN’S MOTHER (0.S.)
(squeezing him, emotional)
Okay, sweetie... Thank you...

EXT. APARTMENT COURTYARD - TWILIGHT

Owen exits his building. Across the way he SEES JACK (the
weight-lifter we saw through the telescope earlier); he wears
an INSULATED RUNNER'S OUTFIT, stretching his legs against the
wall. He looks over at Owen, nods hello, JOGS OFF.

Owen starts for the jungle gym; he looks up at the BOARDED UP
WINDOWS of the apartment next to his... no signs of life...

JUNGLE GYM - LATER

Owen sits by himself, playing with a RUBIK’S CUBE, struggling
with it. After a long beat, A FIGURE comes up quietly behind
him, sits on the jungle gym. It’s the GIRL. Owen can tell
she’s there, but doesn’t turn. Finally, she speaks:

GIRL
Oh, it’s you again, huh?

Owen doesn’t respond, pretending to be occupied by the Cube.

GIRL
You know, I really wanna be left
alone...

OWEN
Me too.

Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library
26.

GIRL
So leave.

Owen doesn’t turn, but decides to take a stand, fires back:

OWEN
You leave.
(then, a bit weaker)
I’ve lived here way longer than
you...

Beat. She just accepts that. Sits there. She looks at the
Rubik’s Cube, tremendously curious, despite herself:

GIRL
What is that?

OWEN
-..This?

She nods, defensive. He looks at her like it’s so obvious:

OWEN
It’s a Rubik’s Cube.
(then, is she nuts?)
You don’t know Rubik’s Cube?

GIRL
Is it a puzzle?
OWEN
Yeah... Wanna try?

(beat, holds it out)
Try it. You can give it back
tomorrow.

GIRL
That’s okay. I might not be here
tomorrow.

OWEN
Day after tomorrow then. But I’m
gonna need it back.

GIRL
«+-How do you do it?

OWEN
You gotta make each side all one
color.
(he does a side)
See?

Finally, she takes it. Gets to work. Beat. Owen notices:

Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library
27.

OWEN
.+-You smell kinda funny.

And she looks quite ill. So pale. Frail. She glances up,
self-conscious; returns to the puzzle. Owen sees her clothes
are thin, worn out, like a street urchin’s:

OWEN
Aren’t you cold?
GIRL
(eyes on the puzzle)
No.
OWEN
Why not?
GIRL

I dunno. I don’t really get cold.

Beat. He watches her, so absorbed in the Cube. After a
while, he gets up. Waits for her to look up; she doesn’t.
So he starts to walk away... watching her... tentative...

OWEN
...See you tomorrow then...

And as Owen heads off, WE STAY WITH THE GIRL, totally focused
on the puzzle. The door to the building CREAKS open and
SLAMS shut; and she looks up, turns to see Owen is gone.

Just then, we HEAR an INHUMAN GROWL and GURGLE. The Girl
doubles over, in excruciating pain... We HOLD on her, as she
struggles, BREATHING SLOWLY... Finally, she looks up,
glancing around the courtyard, warily. She gets to her feet,
weary, stumbles toward the street...

EXT. BRIDGE UNDERPASS NEAR ENTRANCE TO THE COMPLEX - NIGHT
A FIGURE JOGS towards us, slowing as he approaches the
underpass. It’s JACK, out of breath, on his way back to the
complex. As he enters the dark underpass, he hears a quiet,
FRAGILE VOICE -- it’s EERIE:

FRAGILE VOICE
Help me...

It startles him, he looks around; but it’s dark under here:

JACK
..-Hello?

FRAGILE VOICE
Please... Help me...

Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library
28.

Finally, just barely, he SEES something against the wall ina
dark heap -- it’s the little Girl... She looks terrible...

JACK
Hey there... Are you okay? What
happened?

GIRL
I fell down...

JACK
Yeah...? Can’t you get up...?

GIRL
No...

JACK
How old are you, sweetheart? Do
you live around here...?

GIRL
I live right here... Can you carry
me...?
JACK
Okay, sweetheart... sure... Why
don’t you -- here...
(bends down to lift her)
Grab onto me... Okay...?

We WATCH the two of them, their FIGURES in SILHOUETTE: she
reaches out her TREMBLING ARMS, tries to grab on to him --

GIRL
Thank you...

JACK
(lifting her gingerly)
You got it...?

GIRL
(struggling to hold on)
...yeah...
JACK

(feels her slipping)
You got it -- ?

THEN -- ALL AT ONCE -- THE GIRL’S BODY CONVULSES VIOLENTLY
AROUND JACK WITH INCREDIBLE SPEED AND STRENGTH! SHE BITES
VICIOUSLY INTO HIS NECK, EASILY OVERPOWERING HIM, EVEN THOUGH
HE’S THREE TIMES HER SIZE -- HE SCREAMS, STAGGERING TERRIBLY
IN UTTER SHOCK AND HORROR --—

Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library

JACK
JESUS CHRIST!!! JESUS CHRIST!!!

And he COLLAPSES, the Girl on him like a vice! HOLD as she
takes a LONG, THIRSTY DRINK from JACK'’S MOTIONLESS BODY...

Finally, she lifts her head. BLOOD STREAMS DOWN HER FACE.
She looks haunted, disturbed. Then, in one swift move, she
reaches down, and TWISTS HIS HEAD SHARPLY, SNAPPING HIS NECK.

She gets up, looks around to see if anyone has seen. No one
is around. And she runs off, her body again moving just like
a little girl’s -- seeming frightened, vulnerable, fragile...

CUT TO:
JACK’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

We're LOOKING THROUGH OWEN’S TELESCOPE, PANNING THROUGH the
empty living room, lights still on... The TELESCOPE SWINGS
OVER and REFOCUSES on ANOTHER WINDOW where LARRY AND VIRGINIA
sit in the dark in their pajamas, watching DYNASTY on TV.
Larry has a hand on Virginia’s BARE THIGH... The TELESCOPE
HOLDS in anticipation of any exciting developments -- WHEN --
we start to HEAR MUFFLED ARGUING -- REVEAL:

OWEN

He takes his eye away from the telescope, and turns toward
his BEDROOM WALL. The new neighbors are fighting again. He
moves closer, climbing onto his bed to listen, concerned.
This time it definitely sounds like THE FATHER is the one
YELLING... the words are INDECIPHERABLE. As Owen presses
his ear to the wall, he can BARELY make out a FEW FRAGMENTS:

BALDING MAN (THROUGH WALL)
...EXPECT ME TO CLEAN IT UP NOW,
DON’T YOU...!

(more INDECIPHERABLE

WORDS; then:)
.. BITCH!

There’s a SUDDEN LOUD BANG! Owen jerks away from the wall,
startled. He LISTENS, catching his breath... but the
neighbors have GONE SILENT again. A thought occurs... Owen
gets up slowly, moves to THE WINDOW, PEERS DOWN AT:

THE COURTYARD
After a moment, there is ANOTHER BANG (a DOOR SLAM) at the
BUILDING ENTRANCE below, and the BALDING MAN STORMS OUT into

the courtyard. He LIMPS with his DUFFLE toward THE STREET...
HOLD, as OWEN WATCHES; then, as it STARTS TO SNOW, CUT TO:

A FROZEN LAKE - NIGHT
Large, expansive, still... We HEAR WATER TRICKLING; PAN TO:

THE SHORELINE. Where fresh water from a SMALL AQUEDUCT PIPE
flows into an opening in the ice... The Balding Man DRAGS
JACK’S BODY through the snow toward the opening... it’s tough
work with his bad leg, and Jack was a big man. Finally, the
Balding Man HEAVES THE BODY into the water. It FLOATS.

Winded, angry, the Balding Man finds a LONG STICK, and
presses it into Jack’s chest. He limps precariously along
the edge of the shore, GUIDING the FLOATING BODY with the
stick toward the SOLID ICE...

As it reaches the perimeter, the Balding Man THRUSTS the
stick against the body, attempting to submerge it under the
ice -- but it SLIPS, and the Man stumbles, almost tumbling
in. He recovers... carefully repositions the stick --

DEAD BODY’S POV - FLOATING ON WATER

looking up at the Man as he gets the stick in place. He is
seething. Using all his might, his face contorting in a
brutal grimace, he lets out a VICIOUS, ENRAGED GRUNT, and we
PLUNGE UNDER THE WATER -- the SOUND GOES SILENT -- we CUT TO:

 

THE HAUNTING VISION

BLOODY CLOUDS billowing in CLEAR BLUE WATER -- as we HOLD on
the horrifically beautiful image, we HEAR QUIET BREATHING...
Something OUT OF FOCUS DRIFTS DOWN into view -- just as we
GLIMPSE it is a SEVERED HEAD -- we HEAR A GASP, and CUT TO:

INT. OWEN’S ROOM - MORNING
Owen AWAKES with a start. Another nightmare. HOLD.
EXT. APARTMENT COURTYARD - MORNING

Owen emerges from his building in his jacket and backpack, he
starts across the courtyard when he NOTICES something...

CLOSE ON THE RUBIK’S CUBE. It rests on the jungle gym,
covered in fresh snow. Owen picks it up, brushes it off to
see, IT IS COMPLETELY SOLVED. Owen is stunned. He looks up
at the BOARDED UP WINDOWS. Turns back to the Cube, OVERJOYED.

EXT. OWEN’S MIDDLE SCHOOL - MORNING
We TRACK with OWEN as he walks along the CHAIN LINK FENCE
toward the entrance -- he stares at the Cube in disbelief,

oblivious to all else. As he EXITS FRAME, we come to REST ON
a MAKESHIFT SHRINE on the FENCE: pictures, letters, candles.

It’s a MEMORIAL to Scottie Tate. We PULL FOCUS to OWEN as he
reappears behind the fence, walking up to the school, still
gazing at the Cube. The BELL RINGS, Owen starts to run...

EXT. APARTMENT COURTYARD - TWILIGHT

Owen, still holding the Cube, arrives to find the Girl
already waiting on the jungle gym. She looks CLEAN, HEALTHY,
she’s dressed better. She smiles at him.

OWEN
How did you do it?!

GIRL
I just... twisted it.
(smiles)
Do I smell better now?

He smiles, embarrassed... she does. He shrugs, awkward.

OWEN
...What’s your name?

GIRL
Abby. What’s yours...?

OWEN
I’m Owen.
(then)
How old are you?

GIRL (ABBY )
Twelve. More or less. What about
you?

He looks at her queerly:

OWEN
Twelve years, eight months, and
nine days -- what do you mean,
“more or less”...? When’s your
birthday?

ABBY
I don’t know.

OWEN
You don’t know? Don’t you
celebrate your birthday?
(she doesn’t respond; then)
What about your parents? They must
know...

 

Still no response.

OWEN
Don’t you get birthday presents?

ABBY
(simply)
No.

He looks at her, taking awfulness of that in. Beat. Then:

OWEN
Well... you can... have this. If
you want.

ABBY

(smiles, touched)
That’s okay. It’s yours.

He looks at the solved cube, in disbelief. Still excited.

OWEN
I really don’t get how you did
this...

Beat. She looks at him.

ABBY
...Want me to show you?

He smiles. Mixes up the colored squares. Says quietly:

OWEN
Yeah...

ABBY
You have to start with the
corners...

He watches her as she starts to twist... stares at her hair,
her face... she’s actually quite beautiful. We CUT WIDER ON:

THE TWO OF THEM ON THE JUNGLE GYM; MUSIC fades up, we HEAR:

A GIRL’S VOICE (JULIET)
Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet
near day...

INT. OWEN’S ENGLISH CLASS - DAY

ZEFFERILLI’S “ROMEO AND JULIET” plays on a 16 MM PROJECTOR in
the darkened class -- JULIET lies naked in the sheets staring
at ROMEO in the early morning light as he dresses, preparing
to leave. There is quiet GIGGLING among the class at the
romantic/sexual content on the screen. The TEACHER glances
up from a book at her desk, then back down, oblivious.

Paying no attention to the movie, Owen sits, copying
something out of a BOOK: it’s the MORSE CODE ALPHABET. He
writes out the dots and dashes for each corresponding letter
with a certain intensity, an urgency...

Across the room, Kenny sits with a long, broken-off
RETRACTABLE CAR ANTENNA in his hand -- smiling slyly, he
stretches the antenna out to its full length, reaches over,
taps the shoulder of A CHUBBY GIRL WITH GLASSES in the next
aisle, then quickly pulls it away, retracts it again. The
Girl turns, annoyed, can’t figure out who’s tapping her...

Pleased, Kenny turns, looking for his next victim, when he
spots Owen, on the other side of the room, copying... The
sight of Owen so deeply immersed in something somehow irks
Kenny; he stares at him darkly, wondering what he’s up to...

HOLD on Owen as he writes... He starts to bounce his leg,
anxious, excited... He pinches his crotch reflexively...
Has to pee... But keeps right on working... On a mission...

ON THE SCREEN, Romeo kisses Juliet farewell --
ROMEO
I must be gone and live, or stay
and die...
INT. BATHROOM STALL - DAY
CLOSE ON OWEN as he finishes peeing. He zips his fly, and

reaches out his leg, about to flush the toilet with his shoe
when he hears a group of FOOTSTEPS in the bathroom -- the

sound of METAL SCRAPING echoes... Owen freezes...
There is a KNOCK at the stall door... Owen remains perfectly
still... Then, a loud BANGING... Finally, Owen flushes,

unlocks the door, opens it, steps slowly --
OUTSIDE THE STALL

Kenny, Donald and Mark wait for him. Mark sits on a metal
trash can propped against the bathroom door, blocking it.

KENNY
What were you writing back
there...?

OWEN
...What do you mean?

KENNY

In Cook’s class.
(beat)

Let’s see it...

Beat. Owen looks at him, decides to take a quiet stand...

OWEN
---No.

KENNY
..-Mo?

Kenny approaches, extends the old car antenna in his hand...

KENNY
Where is it...?

SLAM -- he lashes the antenna viciously against Owen’s leg!

KENNY
Where is it...?

SLAM -- even HARDER! But Owen, in pain, remains silent...

KENNY
Show me!

Frustrated, Kenny swings higher, SLASHES OWEN’S FACE! Owen,
stiff as a board, clenches his eyes shut, his cheek BLEEDING.

DONALD
...desus Christ, dude...!

KENNY
..-What...?

DONALD
You explain that to his mom...

KENNY
That’s okay...

He walks up close to Owen, grabs him hard by the hair -- Owen
keeps his eyes shut..

KENNY
She’s not going to tell her mom on
us, is she...? She fell down on
the playground, that’s all...
Right? Right...?
Owen slowly opens his eyes, squints, preparing for more --

KENNY
Say it, little girl... Say it...

The SCHOOL BELL RINGS.

DONALD
C’mon, dude... Let’s go...

Kenny just stands there for a moment, staring Owen down.
Finally, they start to go. Owen watches, terrified... HOLD
on his frightened face, as we HEAR:

OWEN (V.O.)
(whispering, miserable)
I fell down...

INT. OWEN’S APARTMENT - DINNER TABLE - NIGHT

ON OWEN as he sits there, head hung low, a BAND-AID on his
face; his mom, seen from shoulders down, sets food in front
of him, as he finishes telling her about his “accident”:

OWEN
.«..On the playground.

OWEN’S MOTHER (0.S.)
(takes his face in her
hands)
Well you have to be more careful,
honey... Okay? I don’t like to
see my baby hurt...

She kisses the top of his head. Owen nods, ashamed. Then:

OWEN’S MOTHER (0.S.)
Eat, sweetie. Please.

As she heads OFF-SCREEN, Owen STABS his mac and cheese, but
doesn’t eat; he just sits holding the fork, anger building...

EXT. APARTMENT COURTYARD - JUNGLE GYM - NIGHT

Abby watches as Owen digs folded pieces of paper out of his
backpack -- the MORSE CODE keys he copied down. His mood is
so much brighter now that he is at Abby’s side again --

OWEN
Here, look -- I made one for you,
and one for me --

Abby sees a copy of ROMEO AND JULIET in the backpack -- picks
it up, recognizing it with a tiny smile:

ABBY
Are you reading this?

OWEN
It’s for school, it’s boring --
c’mon, look...! It’s so cool...!

OWEN (CONT'D)
We can talk to each other...!
Through the wall...!

She looks at him, suddenly uncomfortable... Puts down the
book. Stares at the paper for a moment... Says quietly:
ABBY

Can you hear me through the wall?

Owen suddenly realizes he just let something slip, wishes he
hadn’t... He shrugs a shoulder, awkward, guilty:

OWEN
.--Only sometimes...

Beat. She puts down the paper, stares at her shoes...
ABBY
What about the other night...? Did
you hear anything the other
night...?
OWEN
..-A little...
(beat; then, quiet,
tentative)
What was your dad so mad about...?
No response. He looks at her. She still doesn’t look up.
OWEN
Where’s your mom...? Are you
parents divorced?

ABBY
My mom is dead.

Owen looks at her. Takes in the hugeness of that. Then:
OWEN
My mom and dad are getting a
divorce.

She looks up. Smiles sadly. Sees the band-aid on his cheek.

ABBY
What happened there...?

She points to his cheek. He looks away.

OWEN
Just some kids. At school.

She looks at him, concerned -- he tries to brush right past:

OWEN
Where do you go to school anyway?
I never see you --

ABBY
Owen, listen.

He stops. She looks at him, deadly serious.

OWEN
..-What...?

ABBY
You have to hit back.
(then)
You have to hit back hard.

Beat.

OWEN
...There are three of them...

ABBY
Then you hit back even harder.
(beat)
Hit them harder than you dare. And
then they'll stop.

OWEN
..-What if they hit me back?

ABBY
You have a knife.

OWEN
Yeah... But what if they --

ABBY
-- Then I'll help you.

He looks at her...

OWEN
+..-You? You’re a girl...

She touches his hand gently, reassuringly. He looks down at
her hand, touching his... Finally, he tentatively rubs his
finger against hers. Looks back up at her. She smiles:

ABBY

I’m a lot stronger than you
think...

Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library
38.
Finally, he smiles. Somehow more encouraged. He slips the
paper back in her hand, grabs his, gets up; looks at her...

OWEN
Come on...

She looks at him, confused. He starts to go...

OWEN
Come on...!

She rises, and he takes off, running toward the building --
we CUT TO --

A HIGH ANGLE

looking down at them, as Abby chases after Owen playfully...
REVEAL

This is the BALDING MAN’S POV from his apartment window...

He has peeled back some of the cardboard and newspaper,
stands there WATCHING... He looks... JEALOUS...

 

INT. OWEN’S ROOM - NIGHT

Still fully dressed, Owen lies, studying his Morse Code cheat
sheet on his bed, close to the wall, listening for Abby...
Suddenly, he HEARS a MUFFLED COMMOTION from next door:

ABBY (THROUGH WALL)
..-Move...

(then)
...-I have to get in there...!

 

Owen listens, concerned...
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WALL

We WATCH through a DOORWAY as the Balding Man sits on a naked
mattress next to the wall, newspaper in hand, a SMALL
TRANSISTOR RADIO playing CLASSICAL MUSIC at his side. He
stares up at Abby who waits impatiently, for him to move...

Finally, looking almost wounded, he picks up his little radio
and gets up, limping away toward the doorway -- he starts to
close the door as, BEHIND HIM we SEE Abby climb onto the
mattress with her cheat sheet -- she KNOCKS once; a KNOCK
comes back --

CLOSE ON the Balding Man’s face as he finishes shutting the
door in the F.G. He stands there, listening, perturbed...

BACK IN OWEN’S ROOM
Owen starts to TAP out his message on the wall to Abby:
OWEN
(whispering to himself)
S...W...E...E...

CLOSE ON his cheat sheet, as he continues -- on the paper, he
has written out the code for the phrase: “SWEET DREAMS”...

INT. OWEN’S MIDDLE SCHOOL - INDOOR POOL - DAY

Quiet. Between classes. Owen makes his way to a little,
windowed SIDE OFFICE, where he finds Mr. Zoric on his break,
reading the paper, sipping coffee.

OWEN
Mr. Zoric...?

MR. ZORIC
(glances up, then back at
newspaper )
Yes, Owen?
OWEN
I was wondering. About the after
school strength training class?
Can people still... sign up?

Zoric looks up. Lowers his newspaper. He stares at Owen,
trying to make out what is going on, senses it’s serious:

MR. ZORIC
.»»-You like to get strong?

Owen shrugs, embarrassed; Zoric nods, slow... Then:
MR. ZORIC
Okay. Four o’clock. You come. We
make you strong.

Owen nods. JZoric returns to his paper. Owen starts to go --

MR. ZORIC
Hey...

Owen turns back. JZoric glances up, then back at the paper:

MR. ZORIC
...We teach you swimming too.

Owen smiles sweetly:

OWEN
..-Okay...

INT. OWEN’S MOM’S BEDROOM - TWILIGHT
An unmade bed. Empty wine glasses on the night stand.

Owen sneaks cautiously in, peeks at the partially opened door
to the adjoining bathroom; hears THE SHOWER running...

He moves to HIS MOTHER'S PURSE, sitting open on her dresser.
He reaches in, carefully pulls out HER WALLET... opens it...
takes out a TWENTY DOLLAR BILL... He starts to put the
wallet back, when he SEES --

A POSTCARD IMAGE OF JESUS CHRIST AND THE SACRED HEART

stuck on the dresser mirror above him: Jesus stares down with
his look of infinite compassion; Owen stares back, wary...

INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE APARTMENTS —- TWILIGHT

Owen quietly exits his apartment, walks next door to Abby’s.
He KNOCKS on the door, when he hears IRREGULAR FOOTSTEPS --
he turns to see the BALDING MAN approaching from the
stairwell, carrying an empty plastic trash can.

As he sees Owen, the Balding Man slows to a stop, stares
stone-faced, menacingly... Owen smiles at him, unsure, a
little afraid... After a LONG BEAT, the Man sighs slowly;
then speaks, very quietly, ominously:

BALDING MAN
You know... I was like you once...

Owen stares at him, uncomfortable. Then, even more quiet:
BALDING MAN
(almost to himself)
I was just... like you.

Beat. Owen is bewildered. Growing anxious, he utters:

OWEN
...Is... Abby home...?

But the Man just keeps staring, lost in thought -- just as,
Abby opens the door. She starts to smile, seeing Owen -- but
her smiles fades as she sees the Balding Man too. Wonders
what exactly is going on out here...

Relieved, Owen turns to her:

Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library

OWEN
Hey...

Her smile immediately returns.

ABBY
Hey.

And the two of them head off down the hall together, as the
Balding Man watches... Abby steals a look back at him...
Glares at him...

INT. LITTLETON VIDEO ARCADE - NIGHT

Owen and Abby stand at the same Ms. Pac-Man machine where
Owen saw the Tenth Grade couple French kissing earlier...
Abby watches, fascinated as Owen plays with great intensity.
As he dies, Owen scrunches his face, laughs; he gestures it’s
Abby’s turn. She takes the joystick, unsure, but smiling...

THE CANDY COUNTER - MOMENTS LATER

Owen puts down the TWENTY DOLLAR BILL to pay for a bunch of
PACKAGES OF NOW AND LATERS; he gestures to the candy, so
excited; he has to SHOUT over the BLASTING VIDEO GAME SOUNDS:

OWEN
Want some?! They’re really good!
They’re my favorite!

Abby looks at the candy, oddly uncomfortable --

ABBY
(shakes her head, waves
her hand)
No, I don’t want it...!

Owen is a bit hurt she doesn’t want to at least to try some;
but he makes the best of it, points to the display:

OWEN
Well...! What do you like...! You
can have anything you want...!

Abby tries to be polite; it comes off colder than she means:

ABBY
I don’t... really eat this stuff!
OWEN
(nods, smiles, a letdown)
Oh...! Okay...!

Owen turns to the Seventeen Year Old Counterman:

Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library
42.

OWEN
I guess that’s it...!

The Counterman takes the cash, gives Owen the change. Abby
watches as Owen collects his candy, trying to hide his
disappointment. She feels bad.

ABBY
Well... maybe I could try just
one.

   

Owen looks up, suddenly excited. He opens a package, gives
her a piece. She puts it in her mouth. He watches for her
reaction. She smiles for him, nods. He grins, so pleased --

CUT TO:
EXT. STREET - MOMENTS LATER

Abby stands VOMITING VIOLENTLY, bent over against the side of
a building. Standing back a bit, Owen watches, feeling just
terrible. Finally, she looks up, embarrassed, sad...

ABBY
-.-Sorry.

Owen looks at her there, seeming so thin, so frail, so broken
-- his heart aches... He so wants to comfort her... He
moves to her, awkwardly, and, out of nowhere, just puts his
arms around her... holds her tight...

Abby stands there stiffly, arms at her side, a bit stunned.
Finally, she relaxes her body, gives in to him. She rests
her head against his... But her eyes look troubled. Then:

ABBY
(whispers)
Owen... Do you like me?

OWEN
(still holding her)
Yeah...
(then)
A lot.

Beat.
ABBY
Would you still like me... even if
I weren't a girl...?
OWEN

(beat)
...-What do you mean...?

Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library
43.

But she doesn’t respond. Finally, he says:

OWEN
I dunno... I guess so...

As she listens, Abby’s EYES DRIFT to OWEN’S BARE NECK -- so_
tantalizingly close to her mouth... Her PUPILS WIDEN subtly,
involuntarily -- she catches herself, has to resist her
impulses... She stiffens, pulls away, afraid.

Owen looks at her, confused.

OWEN
...Why?

She smiles sadly, recovering; looks down at her shoes, shakes
her head:

ABBY
No reason...

EXT. ENTRANCE TO APARTMENT COURTYARD - NIGHT

Owen and Abby walk side by side, back into the courtyard...
Somewhere in the distance, the familiar TRAIN HORN echoes...

OWEN
So where are you from? How come
you guys moved here...?

ABBY
We... move around a lot.

OWEN

Yeah, but why would you move here?
I hate it here. Someday I’m gonna
get out...

(smiles at her)
And I‘1l never come back...

(beat, looks away)
People here are just... stupid.

Abby looks at Owen. She stops, reaches for his hand -- he
sees it, starts to reach back, WHEN --

OWEN’S MOTHER (0.S.)
Owwwwen...!

Startled, Owen pulls away; he’s suddenly angry, embarrassed:
OWEN

(muttering)
Oh God... Hang on...

He heads into courtyard -- we CUT TO:
The POV from OWEN’S APARTMENT WINDOW, looking DOWN past
Owen’s Mother's OUT OF FOCUS HEAD -- Owen LOOKS UP AT US:
OWEN
What...!

OWEN’S MOTHER (0.S.)
Where were you?! I called you!

OWEN
I’m right here!

OWEN’S MOTHER (0.S.)
You promised me you wouldn't leave
the courtyard -- !

OWEN
-- I been here the whole time...!!!

OWEN’S MOTHER (0.S.)
Well, come up! It’s time for
dinner...!

OWEN
Okay...!!!

We CUT BACK DOWN to Owen, on the ground; he turns. Abby’s
gone.

INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE APARTMENTS —- MOMENTS LATER

Owen trudges up the steps -- finds Abby waiting, sitting by
her doorway... she stands as Owen approaches; she smiles:

ABBY
Night...

Owen smiles back. Nods... Then, he goes inside his
apartment... She watches as he shuts the door...

Then, she starts to open her own door...

INT. ABBY’S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - NIGHT

Abby enters to find the Balding Man grimly packing up his
duffle -- she watches, unseen by him, as he neatly places the

freshly washed plastic jug in the bag. Finally, she speaks:

ABBY
You going out...?

Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library
45.

He looks at her. Then gets back to work. Not looking at her
as he finally speaks, quietly, bitterly... The air is tense:

BALDING MAN
Is there a choice...?
(then)
I think maybe I’m getting sloppy.
Maybe I want to get caught...
Maybe I’m just... tired of this...

 

He stares at her. Then:

BALDING MAN
What would you do if they found me?
You don’t think they’d come looking
for you...? People have seen my
face. They know we live here.

ABBY
(tentative, a bit afraid)
.»+-You look tired. Maybe you
shouldn't go tonight...

BALDING MAN

What else am I good for?

(then, relents bitterly,

unable to look at her any

longer)
Don’t worry... I won’t let them
find you. I’ve already thought of
what to do. If I have to. I just
want you to know what I go through
for you...

She moves over to him slowly. He turns, seeing her there.
He softens, lowers himself to her. She touches his face. He
closes his eyes. Then opens them, looks down, vulnerable:

BALDING MAN
Please don’t see that boy again...
Okay...?
He looks up at her. But she can’t hold his gaze. She looks
down. He hardens again, knows what that means. He gets up,
and resumes packing his equipment. SEES his BIC LIGHTER, and
CIGARETTES on the counter... Picks them up...

EXT. YMCA PARKING LOT - LONG LENS SHOT - NIGHT

OUT OF FOCUS SMOKE rises in the F.G. around the BLURRY,
SILHOUETTED HEAD of the Balding Man as he watches the YMCA
ENTRANCE in the distance. A few TEENAGERS and YOUNG MEN exit
with gym bags, laughing, carousing, unaware of him..

As they get in their cars, PULL FOCUS to back of the Balding
Man’s head. He takes a last, long drag on his cigarette,
then, FLICKS it away; the burning ashes sparkle briefly...

INT. YMCA - HALLWAY - NIGHT

Lights go out in the empty corridor; it’s closing time. At
the far end of the hall, just outside the front door, we can
see a COUPLE of HIGH SCHOOLERS waiting in the cold, chatting.

PAN SLOWLY AWAY to a CLOSED LOCKER ROOM DOOR on the side of
the hall. From inside, QUIET RUSTLING ECHOES...

INT. YMCA - LOCKER ROOM - SHOWER AREA - NIGHT

In one of the darkened shower stalls, the UNCONSCIOUS BODY of
a LANKY TEENAGER hangs up-side-down on a rope from the shower
head. Wearing his cloth mask, the Balding Man digs items out
of his duffle -- the plastic jug, the funnel, the knife...

He sets the jug and funnel in place, right under the
Teenager’s head... He gets on his knees, by the Teenager’s
head, starts to open the folding knife, preparing to cut...

BACK IN THE HALLWAY

The High Schoolers chatting outside look like they are
getting impatient -- one of them yanks open the front door --
YELLS:

HIGH SCHOOL KID
What the fuck, Dan?!!! Let’s go!!!

IN THE LOCKER ROOM

The Balding Man freezes, hearing the voice... He waits...
Listening... When he starts hearing APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS --

HIGH SCHOOL KID (0.S.)

Trying not to panic, the Balding Man stands slowly, moves to
the locker room door, hears the footsteps getting closer. He
presses himself to the wall, gripping the knife tensely,
preparing to ambush anyone that comes through that door, if
it comes to that... He tries to control his BREATHING...

Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library

The door SHAKES as someone tries to open it from the other
side -- it’s LOCKED -- there’s a sudden BANGING on the door --

HIGH SCHOOL KID (0.S.)
ARE YOU IN THERE, DAN...?!!!

CLOSE ON THE LANKY TEENAGER as he hangs in the shower stall,
unconscious, serene...

HIGH SCHOOL KID (0.S.)
..-DAN?!!!

The Lanky Teenager’s eyes barely flutter open, groggily,
maybe hearing his name. But he is totally out of it...

IN THE HALL

The High School Kid stands outside the Locker Room door --
the Other Kid calls from the front entrance --

OTHER KID

What’s going on, man...!

 

The High School Kid starts walking away from the Locker Room,
back toward the entrance --

HIGH SCHOOL KID
I don’t know! I don’t know where
he is...!
THE BALDING MAN
Listens as the footsteps start to get quieter... CUT TO --
THE LANKY TEENAGER’S UP-SIDE-DOWN POV

As his eyes FOCUS, seeing the Balding Man in his mask,
pressed ominously to the wall by the door with the knife --

The horror of the image, starts to bring him to --

LANKY TEENAGER
..-Hey...

Startled, the Balding Man turns to the Lanky Teenager -- the
Teenager’s eyes widen, he SCREAMS SUDDENLY --

LANKY TEENAGER
HELLLLLLLP...!!! HELLLL-—

The Balding Man panics, doesn’t know what to do --

IN THE HALL

The Two High Schoolers hear the SCREAMING, scramble back
toward the Locker Room --

LANKY TEENAGER (0.S.) (CONT'D)
--LLLLP_ME...!!!

They spot a JANITOR down another hallway, pushing a cart --
HIGH SCHOOL KID
(to the Janitor)
Hey!

JANITOR
What are you kids doing -- ?!

HIGH SCHOOL KID
-- Do you have the key...?!

BACK IN THE LOCKER ROOM

More BANGING at the door, as the Lanky Teenager continues
SCREAMING! The Balding Man uses all his strength to slide a
heavy metal bench in front of the door -- then he turns,
rushes toward the Teenager, who starts to SHRIEK even louder!
The Man quickly gathers up his equipment -- the jug, the
funnel -- and stuffs it all into his duffle! He turns, looks
around for another exit, but there is none...!

A KEY SCRAPES into the Locker Room door -- and the lock turns
with a LOUD CLICK -- !

Nowhere to go, the Balding Man heads straight --

INTO THE SHOWERS

retreating into the farthest stall -- he presses himself into
the corner, slides down the tile to the floor, cowering in
complete terror... He starts digging madly into the duffle,

finally pulling out the GLASS JAR OF ACID, just as --
THE LOCKER ROOM DOOR
opens, SLAMMING SHORT into the metal bench! The Men behind

the door PUSH, and the bench STARTS TO SLIDE -- SCRAPING
SLOWLY AGAINST THE FLOOR -- !

THE BALDING MAN

rips the cloth mask off his face! He reaches down, unscrews
the lid from the glass jar -- he lifts it near his head,
breathing hard, HESITATING, when -- he HEARS the High
Schoolers and Janitor finally entering the Locker Room -- !

In total anguish, the Balding Man braces himself, with not a
moment to lose -- he WHISPERS a final, PAINED CRY --

BALDING MAN
..-Abby...!

-- then DOUSES HIMSELF WITH THE ACID, pouring it over his
head -- and as it STARTS to SIZZLE and SMOKE --

HIS SCREAMS

ECHO HORRIFICALLY throughout the LARGE, TILED SPACE...!
CUT TO:

INT. OWEN’S ROOM - OVERHEAD SHOT - NIGHT

Quiet. Dark. Owen lies in bed, staring up at the ceiling,
deep in thought. The faintest smile grows on his face, then
fades away. Finally, unconsciously, he reaches out his hand,
gently touches the wall, pressing his palm flat, tenderly
against it --

INT. ABBY’S ROOM - OVERHEAD SHOT - AT THAT SAME MOMENT

Abby lies on the mattress, her hand already on the wall, as
if touching Owen’s on the other side. Still fully dressed,
she lies there, perfectly still... when a LOW, inhuman GROWL
breaks the silence... Abby rolls onto her side, clutching
her stomach, looking frail... Hungry... Alone...

INT. OWEN’S MIDDLE SCHOOL - WEIGHT ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

Owen lies grunting on a weight bench, struggling hard with
some very light chest presses, as Mr. Zoric sits nearby,
reading the NEWSPAPER -- the HEADLINE reads: “RITUAL KILLER
CAUGHT IN THE ACT -- SUSPECT ATTEMPTS SUICIDE --
HOSPITALIZED, IN CRITICAL CONDITION”.

Zoric looks up from the paper, sees Owen awkwardly battling
the weight -- puts down the paper, helps him lift the bar
safely up... Owen looks at him, a bit embarrassed at how
weak he is; but Zoric nods encouragingly:

MR. ZORIC

Don’t worry. Is good. Very good
for start.

Owen smiles, and we CUT TO:
OWEN’S PANTS, STUFFED IN A URINAL

In the LOCKER ROOM BATHROOM. Disgusted, depressed, Owen
stands there staring in his underwear, partially dressed. He
carefully fishes the soaked pants out with his hand, dangling
them away at arm’s length...

EXT. OWEN’S MIDDLE SCHOOL - WIDE SHOT - LATE AFTERNOON

TRACK WITH OWEN as he starts for home in the waning light of
the day, wearing his jacket, his backpack, and his little gym
shorts. His breath mists is the freezing air... In his hand
hangs a clear plastic bag containing his wet pants...

CUT TO:
CLOSE ON THE BALDING MAN’S TRANSISTOR RADIO

as the LOCAL NEWS plays through HEAVY, SURGING STATIC from
its tinny speaker:

NEWSCASTER
.+-Police say an unidentified man has
been arrested in connection with the
recent ritual murder of a local high
school honor student...

REVEAL ABBY

who lies in a fetal position on the naked mattress in the
dark room, staring at it. Concerned, she picks the radio up,
trying to adjust the reception as the Newscaster continues:

NEWSCASTER
...-The suspect is hospitalized in
critical condition with severe, self-
inflicted acid burns over his face
and torso, making it impossible so
far for authorities to determine his
identity...

EXT. APARTMENT COURTYARD - NIGHT

Owen sits alone on the jungle gym, with his Rubik’s Cube.

He’s got two sides done, and is working on a third... Losing
interest, he stops, looks up at the boarded up windows of
Abby’s apartment, stares for a long time... Waiting...

Finally, he SIGHS, disappointed, wondering where she is...
It STARTS TO SNOW...

CUT WIDE ON THE COURTYARD -- OVER THIS we HEAR:

ANNOUNCER’S VOICE
Ladies and gentlemen, the President
of the United States: Ronald Reagan!

As excited APPLAUSE breaks out, we CUT TO:
INT. HOSPITAL LOBBY - RECEPTION AREA - NIGHT

The APPLAUSE plays over a TELEVISION in the deserted lobby.
Reagan walks up to the podium, shakes the Announcer’s hand,
as the crowd continues with its standing ovation:

RONALD REAGAN ON TV
Thank you... Thank you very much...

Oblivious, the ADMITTING NURSE sits reading a magazine.

After a moment, Abby enters, walks slowly to the counter; she
puts on a bit of an act, looking sad, lost... there are
snowflakes in her hair...

ABBY
Excuse me... I’m... looking for my

father...?

 

ADMITTING NURSE
Is he a patient here...?

ABBY
Yeah... They... brought him in
last night...
(looks down, ashamed)
.+.-The police did.

ADMITTING NURSE
(suddenly realizing who
she means, pained)
-..Oh... I see...
Abby looks up, vulnerable, looks like she might cry:

ABBY
Do you know where he is...?

The Nurse looks at her for a beat, feeling terrible for her,
tries to be gentle:

ADMITTING NURSE
He's... he’s on the tenth floor,
sweetie... But it’s restricted...

Beat; she looks at Abby with a sad smile, picks up the phone:

ADMITTING NURSE
Look -- why don’t I call them, tell
them you’re here --

But Abby immediately starts to back off --

ABBY
-- Oh, no -- that’s okay...

And she heads for the door. Surprised, the Nurse watches her
go, still holding the phone. Then, just before Abby exits,
she notices something with horror -- Abby is barefoot...

ADMITTING NURSE
(under her breath)
Oh my God -- you poor thing...

She hangs up the phone, and runs after Abby --

ADMITTING NURSE
Hey -- ! Sweetie -- ?!

EXT. FRONT OF HOSPITAL - WIDE SHOT - IMMEDIATELY

The Admitting Nurse comes out to see that Abby is already
gone, nowhere to be found. She looks around, confused,
concerned. Finally, she turns, heads back...

As she re-enters the building, we HOLD -- a SHADOW on the
FACADE, three floors up, suddenly STARTS MOVING -- STARTS
CLIMBING -- it’s ABBY...!

 

INT. TENTH FLOOR HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

SNOW SWIRLS outside the window. We HEAR the OMINOUS,
RHYTHMIC HISSING of a RESPIRATOR just OFF-SCREEN. After a
moment, Abby appears, crouching on the ledge... She STARES
at something 0.S., pained; then knocks gently on the glass...

HOLD.

We HEAR a RUSTLING of SHEETS... Abby waves sadly, as a BLURRY
FIGURE starts to make his way slowly INTO FRAME... It’s the
Balding Man, his face ravaged by acid; he hobbles weakly to
the window, wheeling his IV and HEART MONITOR with him. AN
AIR TUBE snakes from his neck. He pulls open the window...

ABBY
..-May I come in...?

He gestures to his twisted mouth, his neck: he can’t talk.

Abby nods. The Man leans his head out the window, close to
hers. She looks at him, heartbroken; her eyes start to tear.

She looks down, ashamed, whispers:

ABBY
---I’m sorry...

She looks back up at him, tears streaming down her cheeks...

Struggling, he reaches out, touches her face... Gently wipes
away her tears... She takes his hand in both of hers,
presses it to her cheek. Closes her eyes. Trembling.

Finally, starting to recover, she looks up at him,
vulnerable. At a loss... She smiles sadly:

ABBY
I don’t... know what to do...
(then; kindly)
What would you like me to do...?

He looks at her, hesitating. Then he reaches up to the tube
in his neck, and YANKS it out -- an ALARM on the MONITOR
starts to BEEP. The Balding Man leans down, vulnerably
presenting his neck to her, gestures to it...

Abby’s expression turns grave, as she stares it him. She
touches his head softly... Then, suddenly, she bends down,
and BITES into his neck -- BLOOD SPURTS, she DRINKS DEEPLY...

The WIND starts to pick up as the Balding Man goes limp --
the DRAPES are sucked out the window, WHIPPING FURIOUSLY
around them as the Man’s body slumps -- Abby pulls aside,
blood dripping from her mouth -- she watches as the Man
starts to FALL -- he DROPS TEN FLOORS to the snow covered

ground below -- !

 

A BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAM erupts from --
INSIDE THE ROOM

The HEAVYSET NURSE (from the opening of the film) has just
entered -- she RUSHES toward the open window where the DRAPES

TWIST WILDLY, obscuring the view -- ! Realizing the Balding
Man must have just jumped, she puts her head in her hands,
horrified --

The POLICEMAN bursts into the room, and we REPEAT THE MOMENT
FROM THE OPENING OF THE FILM!

EXT. LEDGE OUTSIDE WINDOW - CONTINUOUS
The Policeman leans out, staring down at the Balding Man’s
body -- only now, from this VANTAGE POINT, we are able to

REVEAL something we couldn’t see before -- unseen by the
Policeman --

ABBY
stands pressed to the wall, watching, terrified, just out of
sight -- as the Policeman utters breathlessly --

POLICEMAN

Jesus, Mary, and Joseph...

HOLD on ABBY, as the Policeman retreats inside, to GENERAL
CHAOS and YELLING... As the OFF-SCREEN PANIC BUILDS, Abby
moves to the edge of the ledge, gazing solemnly down...
Finally, she LEAPS into the air, and OUT OF FRAME!

 

CUT TO:
THE WORDS: “ABBY... I’M SORRY...”

SCRAWLED in the Balding Man’s handwriting in the POLICE
NOTEBOOK. RED LIGHT STROBES over the paper -- we ARE:

EXT. FRONT OF THE HOSPITAL - LATER

The Policeman stares at words in his notebook, haunted, as
the Balding Man’s body is lifted in the coroner’s van...

A WOMAN'S VOICE
Excuse me... Officer...?

The Policeman turns --

POLICEMAN
...Yes?

It’s the Admitting Nurse who spoke with Abby in the lobby --
She moves up close, visibly shaken by the proceedings...

ADMITTING NURSE
I’m the admitting nurse... I think
we spoke on the phone...?

POLICEMAN
(remembering)
Oh. Right. About the little
girl...?

She nods. He turns to a fresh page in his notebook... We
START TO PUSH SLOWLY IN ON HIM...

POLICEMAN
What can you tell me about her...?

INT. OWEN’S ROOM - NIGHT

Abby appears outside Owen’s partially opened window, on the
ledge. The Balding Man’s blood still stains her face... She
TAPS on the glass...

ABBY
Owen...!

In bed, Owen starts to wake up, completely out of it... Abby
whispers:

ABBY
Can I come in...?

He starts to get up -- Abby’s alarmed:

ABBY
No -- wait -- don’t look at me...

Owen groans... gets back under covers... facing away...
drifting...

ABBY
But you have to say it... That I
can come in...

OWEN
++.-You can come in...

ABBY
Close your eyes...

OWEN
They’re already closed...

She comes in... She quickly gets out of her bloody clothes,
undressing completely... and climb into bed behind Owen...

OWEN
How'd you get up here...?

ABBY
(beat)
I flew.

OWEN

Yeah, right...

(then, feels something

behind him, opens eyes)
Hey... you're not wearing
anything...!

(then)
And you're freezing...!

ABBY
Sorry... Is that gross...?
Beat.
OWEN
No.
(then)
Where were you today? I waited for
you...
ABBY
...I had to go out.
OWEN
Oh.
(then)
Abby...?
ABBY
Yeah...?
OWEN
Will you go steady with me?
ABBY
(beat)
What do you mean...?
OWEN
Will you be my girlfriend...?
ABBY
Owen... I’m not a girl...
OWEN
You're not a girl...?
ABBY
No.
OWEN
What are you...?
ABBY
I don’t know... I’m... I’m
nothing.
OWEN
Oh.
(then)

You know, it’s okay if you don’t
wanna be my girlfriend. You don’t
have to make stuff up...

ABBY
Can’t we just keep things the way
they are...?

OWEN
(hurt)
Yeah.. Of course...

He stops talking, gives her a bit of the silent treatment.
She can tell she’s hurt him. Feels guilty...

ABBY
Do you... have to... do anything
special when you go steady...?

OWEN
(pouting slightly)
No...
ABBY
So everything’s the same?
OWEN
(obviously)
Yeah...
Beat.
ABBY

Okay. We can go steady.

OWEN
..-Really?

ABBY
Sure.

He smiles. Closes his eyes. Abby stares at Owen’s back...
gently caresses his shoulder, running her fingers down his
arm... and over his hand. She takes his hand in both of
hers, and lifts it, puts is against her cheek, closes her
eyes -- it’s a gesture eerily reminiscent of the one she made

 

 

with the Balding Man just before he died... And as they both
drift off into sleep...

TIMECUT TO:
THE VIEW FROM OWEN’S WINDOW - PRE-DAWN

HOLD for a LONG BEAT, until the SUN just peeks over the
horizon, FLARING CAMERA... It’s beautiful, lyrical...

A THIN SLIVER OF GOLDEN LIGHT reaches over the bottom lip of
the window, SLICES silently into the room... projecting
patterns on the wall...

REVEAL OWEN and ABBY, bathed in SOFT BLUE AMBIENCE, asleep in
bed, like Romeo and Juliet. The LIGHT reaches toward them...

CLOSE ON ABBY’S ARM, as the RAY of SUNLIGHT slowly spreads
out... finally... TOUCHING her SKIN -- the delicate surface
BLISTERS SUDDENLY, starts to SMOKE -- !

ABBY’S EYES SNAP OPEN -- she yanks her arm instinctively out
of the light, startled, in pain! She backs quickly away from
the light, into the corner, pulling the blanket around her.
She looks around the room in horror, stunned that she let her
guard down so low as to find herself right here, right now...
Beside her, Owen remains blissfully in slumber.

Her back to the wall, Abby reaches over very, very
carefully... grabs the cord, gently lowers the blinds...

HOLD on her as she sits there... catches her breath...
CUT TO:
THE WORDS: “I MUST BE GONE AND LIVE, OR STAY AND DIE...”

WRITTEN on a small SCRAP OF PAPER lying on the pages of an
OPEN BOOK on Owen’s DESK. Below the words, a HEART has been
drawn. LIGHT SUDDENLY SPILLS across the paper as we HEAR the
sound of metal BLINDS BEING YANKED OPEN. A HAND enters
FRAME, picks the paper up --

It’s OWEN, having just gotten up; he reads the note, sleepy.
He turns the scrap over -- it’s a fully ripped open package
of Now and Later candies. He lifts the open book the scrap
was lying on, looks at the cover -- it’s “Romeo and Juliet”.
Owen looks back at the scrap -- SEES below the heart is
written, “OWEN + ABBY”. Owen smiles.

EXT. OWEN’S WINDOW - MORNING

The window opens, and out pops Owen’s head -- he looks around
at the great drop below, to the narrow window sills, covered
with undisturbed, virgin snow... How did she get up here

last night...? It’s impossible...
INT. SCHOOL BUS - DAY
Owen sits among a rowdy CROWD of MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENTS,

silently reading his copy of “Romeo and Juliet” -- his brow is
furrowed, the book is hard to understand...

Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library
59.

The crowd starts to get even more excited, looking out the

window -- Owen stops reading, looks out the window to see THE
FROZEN LAKE, as the bus approaches... It’s a school field
trip... Along the distant horizon, a PASSENGER TRAIN speeds...

EXT. BUS - MOMENTS LATER

The Students file off the bus, carrying ICE SKATES; some have
HOCKEY STICKS and HELMETS... Mr. Zoric and a FEW OTHER
TEACHERS supervise, directing the student traffic --

MR. ZORIC
If you play hockey, you play this
side! Free skate, this side!
Everyone careful for holes in ice!
Stay! Away! From holes! We be
watching! So you play safe!

 

 

As Owen starts to put on his skates with the others, Kenny,
Donald, and Mark step up behind him -- Kenny puts his hand on
Owen’s shoulder, leans in, speaking to him quietly, smiling:

KENNY
I hope you been learning how to
swim... Coz today you’re goin’

in...

And the three bullies head out to the ice. Owen watches them
go, with a growing sense of trepidation... and anger...

CUT TO:
A SMALL, FROZEN AQUEDUCT PIPE
along the shore. It looks like the pipe we saw the night the
Balding Man dumped the body of the weight-lifter into the
water -- only now the entire SHORELINE IS FROZEN SOLID.

Owen’s feet trudge by the pipe in skates... He is scouring
the area for something...

A GROUP OF GIRLS skate into the area, laughing, trying out
their best (and not particularly impressive) figure skating
moves -- one of them is the girl Kenny accosted in the pool.
Ignoring them, Owen keeps searching; he spots something, digs
it out of the snow... It’s a LONG STICK -- it could be the
same stick the Balding Man used to submerge the body under
the ice, though there’s no way to be sure...

Owen BANGS the stick against his palm, testing its strength...

EXT. MIDDLE OF THE LAKE - MOMENTS LATER

Kenny, Donald, and Mark make their way across the ice...
Finally coming upon Owen, who stands about twenty feet in
front of a HOLE IN THE ICE, holding the long stick. He
stares at them. Kenny smiles.

KENNY
Is she ready for a swim...?

Owen says nothing, just sets his jaw; but it is clear he is

very afraid... He grips the stick harder, raises it
slightly, bracing himself for trouble... Kenny notices:
KENNY
Whattaya think you’re gonna do with
that...?
OWEN
(trying to be brave)
I’m gonna... hit you with it... If

you try anything...
Kenny looks at his friends, smiles mockingly:

KENNY
Really...? Wow...

NEAR THE EDGE OF THE LAKE

As he tries to organize a hockey game, Mr. Zoric suddenly
sees Owen surrounded by the boys near the hole in the ice...
He watches them with growing concern...

BACK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LAKE

Kenny’s smile fades as he stares Owen down...

KENNY
You know what I think...?

Owen remains silent...

KENNY
I don’t think you’re gonna do a
fucking thing... I think you're
just gonna stand there, like the
little girl you are... And I’m
gonna grab that stick... and ram it
right up your ass... And then...?

(beat, hardens)
You’re goin’ swimming.

Donald sees something, is growing uncomfortable with all
this; says quietly to Kenny:

DONALD
Dude -- Zoric is over there
checking us out -- let it go...

We'll beat his little ass later...

But Kenny isn’t going to be the one to blink... he just keeps
staring... Owen is trembling...

KENNY
Gimme the stick...

Owen doesn’t dare move. Kenny, sensing weakness, suddenly
lunges forward, and Owen, panicked, SHUTS HIS EYES, and
SWINGS THE STICK with ALL HIS MIGHT! IT CONNECTS squarely
with the side of Kenny’s head, and Kenny DROPS, stunned -- !

 

MARK
Holy shit! Are you fucking crazy!?

Owen opens his eyes, shocked to see Kenny, crumpled on the
ice, gripping his ear in excruciating pain -- BLOOD GUSHES!
Kenny starts to SCREAM -- !

MR. ZORIC

turns, hearing Kenny’s agonized screams -- one of the other
Teachers immediately heads toward the middle of the lake to
investigate -- Zoric is about to go too -- when he HEARS MORE

SCREAMS from the other direction -- !

He turns to see the GROUP of GIRLS at the shoreline, by the
aqueduct -- the girl Kenny accosted in the pool is SCREAMING
and CRYING, horrified -- Zoric starts in their direction...!

IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LAKE

The Teacher rushes to Kenny’s aid, shocked by the amount of
blood -- Owen watches, absolutely terrified at what he has
done -- ! He stands there, frozen... drops the stick...
MEANWHILE, AT THE SHORELINE

We watch in WIDE SHOT as Zoric arrives -- the girls are
huddled together, comforting each other; one of them points
to something by the edge of the lake -- Zoric looks, and the
blood drains from his face... He recovers, starts to pull
the girls away -- then, he turns back, staring, aghast...

JACK, THE WEIGHT-LIFTER’S BODY

HALF-SUBMERGED under water, and HALF-FROZEN into the ice. A
CHAIN SAW CARVES around him...

CUT TO:
EXT. LAKE - WIDE SHOT - LATER

POLICE CARS. FIRE TRUCKS. A CROWD has gathered, watching
along with the Students as a CRANE lifts an ENORMOUS, SOLID
BLOCK of ICE CONTAINING JACK’S BODY into the air...

We ZOOM SLOWLY in on MR. ZORIC in the distance as he
animatedly describes what happened to a MAN IN A SUIT, who
has his back to us, taking notes... A PAIR OF COPS need to
squeeze by, and Zoric steps aside, still talking -- as he and
the POLICE OFFICER rotate, switching places, we SEE Zoric has
been talking to the SMALL TOWN POLICEMAN from the opening of
the film; we CONTINUING ZOOMING SLOWLY in, until his HAUNTED,
and CONCERNED face fills frame...

CUT TO:
INT. PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON

ON OWEN, profile, his head hung low. His mother sits out of
focus in the F.G.

PRINCIPAL (0.S.)
Give me one reason I shouldn’t
suspend you, Owen...

(beat)
Can you think of one?

Owen keeps his head lowered, miserable.

PRINCIPAL (0.S.)
Look, I know about Kenny and his

friends, believe me -- I’ve had to
deal with them many times -- but

where would you ever get the idea
that this is the way to handle
things? This in not. The way. To
handle things. Don’t you know what
could’ve happened...?

(then)
You seem like a smart kid. I just
don’t want to see you going down
the wrong path...

 

OWEN’S MOTHER (0.S.)
(very softly, distraught)
He’s a good boy... he really is...

INT. OWEN’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Owen takes off his jacket; his mom is already ON THE PHONE:

OWEN’S MOTHER (0.S.)
Hello...? Is George there...?
Excuse me...? This is his wife --
who's this...?

The DOOR BELL RINGS. Owen looks at his mom, who is angrily
immersed; he trudges for the door, as he continues to hear:

OWEN’S MOTHER (0.S.)
Well, hello, Cindy... Could you
please tell George that I called,
and that I need to talk to him...?
About our son...? It’s urgent.

 

Yes -- if he even gives a shit...
Owen opens the door -- it’s the SMALL TOWN POLICEMAN:
POLICEMAN

(grave tone)
Hi there... Your mom or dad home?

Owen looks at him, suddenly worried -- does this have
something to do with Kenny...?

OWEN
Um... yeah...
(then)

OWEN’S MOTHER (0.S.)
(still on the phone)
Thank you, Cindy... Goodbye...
(hangs up, then, annoyed)

Her FIGURE enters the hallway -- she slows, seeing the
Policeman. Her tone immediately changes, quiets:

OWEN’S MOTHER (0.S.)
-..-Oh... What’s this about...?

POLICEMAN
I’m afraid there’s been an incident
with one of your neighbors here in
the complex... So we’re just going
around, talking to people... see if
anyone knows anything...

OWEN’S MOTHER (0.S.)
..-What kind of incident...?

Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library

The Policeman glances at Owen -- this may not be appropriate
for his young ears; Owen’s mother immediately picks up on it:

OWEN’S MOTHER (0.S.)
(firm)
Owen -- why don’t you go to your
room. ..?

Owen hesitates, disappointed. The Policeman smiles
apologetically, and Owen heads off -- he steals a final look
at them from down the hall --

OWEN’S MOTHER (0.S.)
Would you like to come in,
Officer...?

As the Policeman enters... CUT TO:
INT. OWEN’S ROOM - NIGHT

Dejected, Owen enters, shuts the door... sets down his
backpack by his desk when he sees a FLASH from outside his
window. He HEARS VOICES. He looks out --

ACROSS THE COURTYARD

There’s ACTIVITY inside JACK’S APARTMENT. Owen looks THROUGH
HIS TELESCOPE: it’s SEVERAL POLICEMAN in LATEX GLOVES...
TAKING FLASH PICTURES... SEARCHING FOR EVIDENCE...

Owen watches for a moment, transfixed... when he HEARS
BARKING across the courtyard: he swings his TELESCOPE over to
FIND VIRGINIA, out on her balcony, also silently craning to
try to spy a look at what’s going on in Jack’s apartment --
her tiny lap dog is cradled in her arms --

She turns, suddenly, SEEING OWEN STARING AT HER THROUGH THE
TELESCOPE -- she glares, goes back inside, yanks the drapes
shut. Owen sighs. Then he turns, LOOKS AT HIS WALL...

 

 

INT. ABBY’S ROOM - NIGHT

Looking ill, Abby lies on her mattress when she starts to
hear quiet KNOCKING on the wall... Morse Code... It makes
her smile sadly. She looks over at the wall where she has
taped Owen’s cheat sheet, starts to decode his tapping...

She raises her hand, about to knock back when she hears MORE
KNOCKING -- FROM THE FRONT DOOR. Abby, turns, frightened...

INT. ABBY’S APARTMENT - HALLWAY - NIGHT

Abby creeps toward the front door, on eggshells, trying not
to make a sound... MORE KNOCKING on the door...

Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library

She reaches the door, steps up on her tip-toes to look --
THROUGH THE PEEPHOLE
The SMALL TOWN POLICEMAN stands outside the door, waiting...

Abby backs away from the door... stares at it for a LONG
BEAT, not knowing what to do...

Finally, she hears FOOTSTEPS, as the Policeman starts to walk
away... hears him KNOCKING FAINTLY on some other door...

INT. OWEN’S ROOM - NIGHT

Owen lies on his bed, next to the wall waiting for response
from Abby. He gives up, disappointed. Turns off the light.

INT. OWEN’S MIDDLE SCHOOL - WEIGHT ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON
CLOSE ON Owen on the bench press -- he pushes hard, huffing
and puffing with the barbell; there’s a new fire in his
little body...

INT. INDOOR MIDDLE SCHOOL POOL - LATE AFTERNOON

Owen trains in the pool, holding the edge, kicking his legs.

VOICE
Hey Owen...

Owen looks up to see Mark, the smallest of the bullies
standing there in his bathing suit -- he has a bit of a smile
on his face, he’s hard to read:
MARK
Look’s like you went for a swim
after all, huh...?

Owen glares at him, wondering if this is going to be trouble;
but seeing Owen’s expression, Mark immediately backs off:

MARK
I’m just kidding...

And he moves off, sheepish, to the other side of the pool,
jumps in. Owen watches, surprised: is he afraid of Owen now?

EXT. MIDDLE SCHOOL POOL BUILDING - TWILIGHT

Owen emerges from the building when he overhears VOICES -- he
suddenly backs away, frightened, hides behind a column --

OWEN’S POV:

DONALD and KENNY, a HUGE BANDAGE on his ear, have just
greeted MARK, who’s just come out of the building; as Owen
watches, an OLDER, TALLER KID (KENNY’S BROTHER) suddenly runs
up behind Kenny, and playfully -- though brutally -- wrestles
with his head -- Donald and Mark laugh -- Owen’s intrigued:

KENNY’S BROTHER
How’s the cripple...!

Kenny, the much weaker of the two, wrestles his big brother
off, pissed, protecting his ear:

KENNY
Jesus Christ, dude -- look out...!

KENNY’S BROTHER
(laughing)
Man, that kid wailed on your ass --
(yells in his bad ear)

Can you still hear me, bro -- ?!
KENNY
Stop...!

He SOCKS his older brother hard in the arm; but Kenny’s
brother only seems to enjoy it, this is his idea of humor.
Finally, he eases up, smiles:

KENNY’S BROTHER
You going home?

KENNY
No, we’re going over to Mark's...

KENNY’S BROTHER
Well can I borrow your keys...? I
forgot mine... Pleeeeeease...?

Kenny softens, giving in -- pulls out his keys, hands them
over; his older brother musses Kenny’s hair:

KENNY’S BROTHER
Thanks... See you at home, little
girl...

Kenny pushes him off, instantly mad again. Kenny’s brother
heads off. Kenny turns, sees Donald and Mark grinning:

KENNY
Shut up...

DONALD
(trying to stop smiling)
We didn’t say anything...

KENNY
Shut up...

As they head off, Kenny glowering, his two friends trying to
hide their pleasure, OWEN SMILES... so happy to see the
tables turned on his nemesis... OVER THIS WE HEAR:

OWEN (V.O.)
(quietly excited)
Abby... I did it...

EXT. APARTMENT COURTYARD - JUNGLE GYM - NIGHT
Owen and Abby on the jungle gym. Abby turns to him:

ABBY
You did what...?

OWEN

They were gonna push me in a hole.
In the ice. So I got a big stick
and I hit Kenny really hard in the
head. He had to go to the hospital
-- I was almost suspended. But I
did it. What you said. I stood up
to them.

Abby looks at him, surprised... taking that in...

ABBY
...Owen.

OWEN
...Yeah?

Abby slowly leans in, kisses him gently on the cheek. She
pulls back, smiles at him, proud. Owen beams, embarrassed.
Beat. An idea strikes; he asks quietly:

OWEN
Hey... You wanna go somewhere...?

ABBY
(quiet, intrigued)
Where...?

He hops down, reaches out a hand to her, mysteriously; she
looks at him, then takes it, easing off the jungle gym --

CLOSE ON HER BARE FOOT as it touches the snow... and CUT TO:

DARKNESS

FOOTSTEPS ECHO... A FLASHLIGHT sweeps through FRAME,
illuminating HAND-INKED WORDS ON AN OLD, DUSTY DOOR: “KEEP
OUT”, and “ENTER UPON PENALTY OF DEATH”. Owen enters FRAME,
pushes a shoulder hard into the door, it opens REVEALING:

INT. APARTMENT COMPLEX - BASEMENT STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT

A dim, dingy, concrete space, but a secret world all its own,
furnished with mismatched items salvaged from the trash: a
SUNKEN ARMCHAIR, an OLD COUCH, a THREADBARE PIECE OF
CARPET... BEER and LIQUOR BOTTLES litter the floor. There
are PILES of DOG-EARED GIRLY MAGAZINES. At the center of it
all is a BATTLE-SCARRED PING PONG TABLE, a hole punched
through one side.

Abby takes it all in, walking around with a childlike grin.

OWEN

There was this kid who used to live
in the building. Tommy. He used
to hang out down here with some of
the high school kids, and... they
would drink and smoke. Anyway,
sometimes when the older kids
weren’t around, he’d play ping pong
with me. He was pretty nice,
but... then he moved away.

(beat, looking around)
I kinda like it down here...

ABBY
It’s cool...

OWEN
I don’t think any of the adults
even know about it...

Abby finds on old cassette player, presses play: “The Guns Of
Brixton” by THE CLASH begins, as Abby continues her tour...

ABBY
So... what did you want to do down
here...?
Beat. Owen smiles, watching her...
OWEN
I have an idea... close your

eyes...

Abby stops, looks at him. She smiles. Closes them.

Owen quietly takes his PEN KNIFE out of his pocket. He
glances at Abby, then opens it, presses his thumb carefully

against the SHARP TIP... He swallows, bracing himself...
Then presses hard, suddenly, against the blade, SLICING OPEN
HIS THUMB -- he GRIMACES silently in pain, as it starts to
BLEED... A LOT... He smiles:
OWEN
Okay... let’s... make a pact...

Abby opens her eyes. Owen holds out his BLOODY HAND:

OWEN
«..you and me...

Seeing the BLOOD, Abby immediately FREEZES in HORROR and
DREAD... Her PUPILS WIDEN, like an animal about to pounce --

Oblivious, Owen steps toward her, hand dripping -- he offers
the knife, trying to allay any fears --

OWEN
It’s okay -- it only hurts for a
second, it’s no big deal...

Abby backs away, her stomach GROWLING -- she holds herself
rigid, FIGHTING VICIOUS, HUNGRY URGES... when suddenly, she
SEES OWEN’S BLOOD PUDDLING on the floor; HER EYES FIX ON IT --

 

HOLD for a long, suspended beat, as she STARES, MESMERIZED...
LOSING HERSELF TO INSTINCT... Owen still doesn’t get it, AS --

ALL AT ONCE, Abby DROPS to the ground, HOVERING FEVERISHLY
over the PUDDLE on all fours! She SNARLS RAVENOUSLY --

OWEN watches in shock, as ABBY STICKS AN EERILY LONG TONGUE
OUT of her mouth, begins LICKING THE BLOOD off the concrete!

 

 

OWEN
(breath stolen)
..-Abby...?

Abby suddenly LOOKS UP -- her FACE, smeared with dirt from
the floor, is TRANSFORMED! She has DEMONIC EYES, her

EXPRESSION IS TORTURED, SAVAGE -- she doesn’t even look like
a child anymore...! QUIVERING PRIMALLY, she HISSES, arching
her back, on the VERGE OF ATTACK:
ABBY
Go _ away...!
But Owen can’t move... he is terrified... his eyes start to
well with tears... Abby GLARES FURIOUSLY, POSSESSED:

ABBY
GO...t!!
But he can’t! Then -- knowing if she were to stay even an
instant longer, it would be over -- she turns suddenly,

making a break -- and RUNS WILDLY for the door -- !

Owen is completely stunned -- !

FOLLOWING ABBY -- as she SPRINTS MADLY, PANTING, GRUNTING
like a wild, panicked beast! HER BARE FEET SLAP concrete,
picking up speed -- WE STAY WITH HER AS SHE GOES --

UP METAL STAIRS -- BOUNDING FOR THE EXIT DOORS -- !

EXT. APARTMENT COURTYARD - HIGH ANGLE - NIGHT

Abby bursts into the courtyard and heads STRAIGHT FOR A
TREE... like a feral cat, she launches right up the trunk,
CLIMBING SWIFTLY, EERILY -- her nails SCRATCHING, CLAWING at
the bark as she goes...

AT THE TOP OF THE TREE

We FIND her, settling in the branches, RABID, her SENSES

HEIGHTENED, a HUNGER UNLEASHED, NEEDING TO BE SATED... She
peers around the courtyard below -- her pupils so wide, her
EYES ARE SOLID BLACK... Suddenly, she HEARS a small dog’s

BARKING -- TURNS --
BELOW

VIRGINIA is entering the courtyard, walking her tiny dog.
She’s moving fast, angry, like maybe she’s just had a fight --
fifty feet behind, LARRY follows, trying to catch up; he

calls after her:

LARRY
(out of breath)
Goddammit -- Virginia...!

But she keeps going, towards her building -- and directly
into the path of -- ABBY -- who ABRUPTLY LEAPS DOWN, KNOCKING
VIRGINIA, FACE DOWN, INTO THE SNOW!

 

VIRGINIA SCREAMS, THRASHING WILDLY as ABBY SINKS HER TEETH
INTO HER NECK, TEARING FLESH -- BLOOD SPURTS out into the
snow as Abby begins RUTHLESSLY FEEDING, SLURPING...! Beside
them, the little lap dog growls and barks primevally --

Hearing the screams, Larry begins to RUN! He comes upon the
scene in utter panic and shock, freaking out -- he LUNGES
suddenly at ABBY, KICKING her FIERCELY -- and ABBY is KNOCKED
FREE, TUMBLING into the snow -- !

Abby lifts her head, stunned -- her MOUTH OOZES BLOOD, PIECES
OF FLESH STILL IN HER TEETH...

Larry sees the BLOOD pouring from Virginia’s shredded neck --
he starts for Abby in a blind rage --

LARRY
What the FUCK -- ?!

But before he can reach her, Abby, terrified, snapping back
to reality, TAKES OFF! Larry SCRAMBLES after her, SKIDDING
around in the snow, but Abby’s agility and speed way are too
much for him -- and, in an instant, she’s gone!

JUST THEN, OWEN emerges into the courtyard, dazed as
COMMOTION builds around him -- Larry RANTS desperately,
totally out of breath as RESIDENTS APPEAR on their balconies
to see what’s the matter:

LARRY
(crying, hysterical)
Somebody call 9-1-1...!!! SOMEBODY
CALL 9-1-1...!!!

 

 

He rushes to his girlfriend’s side, as BLOOD STILL GUSHES
FREELY from her neck -- he’s in a complete frenzy --

CLOSE ON OWEN, as LARRY SCREAMS ECHO through the courtyard:

LARRY (0.S.)
(agonized disbelief)
Jesus Christ -- she bit her...!!!
SHE FUCKING BIT HER.. !

 

HOLD, aS DREAD sets in Owen’s eyes... Then, TIMECUT TO:

HIGH ANGLE - OVER COURTYARD - LATER

RED FLASHING LIGHTS. A CROWD OF NEIGHBORS watch, as
PARAMEDICS load Virginia into an AMBULANCE, LARRY at her
side... CUT TO REVEAL -- THIS IS THE POV FROM OWEN’S WINDOW.

Owen stands there watching, visibly shaken; he looks down,
squeezing his thumb, finishes sealing a BAND-AID around it.

He stares at it... Then looks up slowly, across the way...
at Larry and Virginia’s EMPTY APARTMENT... at JACK’S...

LIGHT SPILLING ACROSS OWEN’S MOTHER’S BODY

as she lies in bed in her BLUE NIGHTGOWN, PASSED OUT, FACE
BURIED in the pillow, her HAIR SPLAYED chaotically... we ARE:

INT. OWEN’S MOM’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

OWEN stands, backlit in the doorway, having just opened the
door; he stares in at his mother in the dark room... BEAT.

OWEN
(quiet, vulnerable)
-.--Mom...?

But she doesn’t stir... Owen looks over at the EMPTY WINE
BOTTLE and GLASS on the night stand, realizes she’s going to
be out for quite some time...

HOLD ON OWEN’S STARING EYES, bathed in shadow; they look
frightened, helpless... we start to hear a FILTERED PHONE
RING... Finally, a WOMAN’S VOICE ANSWERS; she sounds SLEEPY:

WOMAN’S VOICE (PHONE FILTER)
.--Hello...?

CUT TO:
INT. OWEN’S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - NIGHT

Owen sits on the floor clutching the phone, his arms hugging
his knees to his chest, his back against the cabinets... He
looks scared, on the verge of breaking down... (NOTE: the

entire conversation is EXTREMELY INTIMATE, QUIET, INTENSE...)

OWEN
Hi... Is my dad there...?

We hear QUIET, INDISTINGUISHABLE VOICES, then, a MAN gets on:

MAN’S VOICE (PHONE FILTER)
Hello...?

OWEN
Dad...? Can I talk to you...? For
a minute...?

MAN’S VOICE (PHONE FILTER)
...Sure, pal. What is it...?
What’s wrong...?

 

 

Owen can’t speak... starts to cry...

OWEN
I dunno...

MAN'S VOICE (PHONE FILTER)
What...?

OWEN
.»+-Do you think...? Is there...?
Is there such a thing... As evil?

MAN'S VOICE (PHONE FILTER)
..-What...?

OWEN
..-Can... people be evil? Is that
true? Is that real...?

SILENCE... Then:

MAN’S VOICE (PHONE FILTER)
What are you talking about, pal...?
I don’t know what you’re talking
about...
(long beat)
Did... something happen...?

Owen doesn’t know what to say... His father grows anxious:

MAN’S VOICE (PHONE FILTER)
Where are you getting this...?
From your mother...? All her...

religious crap..
OWEN

  

No...

MAN’S VOICE (PHONE FILTER)
Jesus Christ -- don’t listen to
that shit, okay...?

OWEN
(heart sinking)
No -- that’s not --

But his father isn’t listening, some past conflict already
triggered --

MAN’S VOICE (PHONE FILTER)
-- Goddammit...!

Away from the phone, we can just BARELY HEAR the Woman --

WOMAN’S VOICE (PHONE FILTER)
What’s wrong -- ?

MAN’S VOICE (PHONE FILTER)

(to the Woman)
She’s filling his head with all
this crap...!

(then, back into phone)
You know what? Owen, listen -- put
your mother on the phone, okay? I
wanna talk to her...

OWEN
Um, she’s... she’s not here...

MAN’S VOICE (PHONE FILTER)
Well please have her call me when
she gets back, alright...?
(beat)
Okay...?

 

Owen makes one last desperate attempt:

OWEN
Dad...?

MAN’S VOICE (PHONE FILTER)
(cutting him off)
Owen, I want you to get that crap
out of your head, okay? You mother
just... she has problems... and I’m
gonna talk to her. So I don’t want
to hear any more about this,

alright?
Owen is crushed...

OWEN
...Yeah...

MAN’S VOICE (PHONE FILTER)
(softens again)
Okay. Good. You have a good
night, pal. I love you. And I’m
sorry about the last couple months,
but I'll see you real soon, okay?
I promise. Maybe next weekend...

OWEN
(world caving in)
Okay... I love you too...
Hangs up. Leaving Owen back where he was. Completely alone.

ABBY’S NOTE: “I MUST BE GONE AND LIVE, OR STAY AND DIE...”

Owen stares at it, curled up on his bed. He looks at the
HEART, “OWEN + ABBY” beneath it... Finally, he steels
himself, and raises his hand to the wall... He hesitates,
then... KNOCKS forcefully. He waits, heart racing...
Nothing. He turns away, maybe relieved... until... a KNOCK
comes from the other side. Owen turns back to the wall...

INT. ABBY’S APARTMENT - FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

Abby opens the door slowly, looking healthier than she has
been. Sees Owen waiting there in his jacket. The air is
charged. They stare at each other. Finally, Owen says:

OWEN
Can I come in...?

She smiles, a bit wary, nods. He is about to enter; then:

OWEN
-.-You have to say it...

She looks at him, surprised by his tone; her smile fades...

ABBY
-..-You can... come in...

He does... she follows, self-conscious, as he walks down the
hall cautiously, seeing her place for the first time... It’s
desolate, almost no furniture, belongings in piles. Spartan.
Owen takes it in silently; then he just stops where he is,
hands in his jacket pockets, not looking at her...

OWEN
(quietly)
Are you a vampire...?

She glances down at her bare feet...

ABBY
I... need blood. To live. Yes.

He looks at her...

OWEN
Are you... dead...?

ABBY
No.
(then)
Can’t you tell...?

Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library

OWEN
But... how old are you? Really.

ABBY
I’m twelve...

(then, still trying to
understand it herself)
But... I been twelve for a very

long time...

Owen glances around, wary...

OWEN
Where’s your dad...?

ABBY
(beat, guilty)
...-He wasn’t... my dad...

Owen looks at her, nods. Owen take a step into the dining
room. On an old table is a collection of STRANGE, WORN OUT
TOYS from many different eras, some of them looking almost
like ANCIENT GAMES or PUZZLES... Owen looks at them...

OWEN
What are all these...?

ABBY
(smiles sadly, shrugs)
...I like puzzles...

He steps over to a series of OPEN BOXES against the wall;
inside, sorted into groups are WATCHES, WALLETS, CLOTHING...

OWEN
What about this stuff...?

ABBY
They’re just things...
(beat)
You can take whatever you want...

Owen sees RUMPLED CASH in one of the boxes. There’s a lot.
A horrible thought occurs:

OWEN
These are things from the people
you kill, aren’t they? You kill
them, and then steal from them,
right...?

She doesn’t respond immediately -- it spooks him -- he starts
for the door, angry --

OWEN
I’m wanna go home now...
But she BLOCKS HIS WAY, sad, doesn’t want him to leave...
OWEN
I wanna go... Are you gonna let
me...?
(then, with an edge)
What are you gonna do to me...?

Stung, she looks up at him, then back down; she steps out of
his way, whispering, heartbroken:

ABBY
«..I told you we couldn’t be
friends...

And Owen heads for the door. She looks up, watches him go...
And as we HEAR the DOOR OPEN and SLAM SHUT, we CUT TO:

THE HALLWAY - IMMEDIATELY

Where Owen stands outside Abby’s front door, heart-racing,
breathing hard through his nose, trying to calm down...

HOLD.
Then --
CUT TO:
EXT. HOSPITAL - DAWN
HOLD as the SUN cracks over the horizon in the distance...
CUT TO:
A MOVING SHOT, DOWN A HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAWN
We FOLLOW a POLICEMAN approaching a HOSPITAL ROOM DOORWAY...
As he walks, we ARC in front of him to see it’s the SMALL
TOWN POLICEMAN; he slows, looks into:
THE HOSPITAL ROOM
It’s DARK, the DRAPES ARE DRAWN. VIRGINIA SLEEPS in bed;
she’s STARTLINGLY PALE, ALMOST BLUE... Her neck is heavily
bandaged, an IV tube trails from her arm...
Slumped but awake in a chair by the bed is LARRY; he looks

like he’s been up all night. He glances up at the Policeman,
who SPEAKS VERY QUIETLY, not wanting to disturb Virginia...

78.

POLICEMAN
Hi... Are you Larry...?

Larry nods.

POLICEMAN
You mind if I talk to you for a
minute...?

Tilts his head, indicating the hall.

LARRY
...Sure.

Larry gets up, EXITS FRAME -- but we STAY ON VIRGINIA... we
PUSH SLOWLY IN on her, sleeping, as we HEAR the two men, just
outside the door, speaking in HUSHED TONES:

POLICEMAN (0.S.)
Sorry to bother you...
(then)
..-How’s... she doing...?

LARRY (0.S.)
(grim, shaken)
It’s been... quite a night... They
had to give her almost six pints of
blood... We’re still waiting to
see if her body rejects it.

As Larry speaks, VIRGINIA’S EYES OPEN with a QUIET START, as
if waking from a nightmare -- her PUPILS ARE SOLID BLACK...

She looks around, disoriented, sees the IV DRIP... looks down
at the line STUCK IN HER ARM... A SPOT OF HER OWN BLOOD is
soaked on the bandage; VIRGINIA STARES AT IT, TRANSFIXED...

 

IN THE HALLWAY

The Policeman nods, sympathetic -- but there’s a sense of
quiet urgency as he speaks --

POLICEMAN
Well, I won’t keep you too long. I
just, I need to ask you about the
description you gave. Of the
little girl.

BEHIND HIM, OUT OF FOCUS, IN THE DOORWAY, we can just make
out some MOVEMENT in the shadows in VIRGINIA’S BED...

POLICEMAN (CONT ’D)
(refers to his notebook)
You said she had dark hair, was
around twelve years old, and wasn’t
wearing shoes...

LARRY
.--That’s right.

The Policeman pulls something from his notebook, shows Larry:

POLICEMAN
Have you ever seen this man? He’s a
suspect in a murder investigation.

Larry looks at it: it’s a SKETCH OF THE BALDING MAN...

LARRY
Yeah... Maybe... Looks like a guy
in our building. Moved in a couple
months ago, I think.

POLICEMAN
Did he have a daughter? Like the
girl you described?

LARRY
I don’t... I don’t know. I’ve
only seen him a few times...

As the Policeman listens, the MOVEMENT in the room behind him
continues, grows more active... And now there are FAINT
SOUNDS in the darkness... DRIPPING sounds...

LARRY (CONT’D)
(concerned)

You think this is related to the

murder case?

POLICEMAN
Maybe. We’re starting to think the
two of them may have been part of
some Satanic cult...

LARRY
(aghast)
What...?
POLICEMAN
We found another body few days
ago... Same M.O. The victim was

completely drained of blood...

THE DAY NURSE appears silently behind the Policeman, pauses
at the open door, checking the patient file, about to enter,
unaware of the activity inside...

POLICEMAN (CONT’D)
But there were bite marks on the
victim’s neck. Small ones. Like a
child's.

 

LARRY
(horrified)
Jesus Christ -- what is that girl --
what’s going on...?

Over the Policeman’s shoulder WE SEE the DAY NURSE step
inside, disappearing into the darkened room --

IN THE ROOM

She moves to the window, OPENS THE DRAPES; turns to SEE --
VIRGINIA

HUNCHED OVER, GNAWING and SLURPING over her own arm, like a
rabid animal -- suddenly, feeling the light spill over her
body, she TURNS --

BLOOD DRIPS FROM HER MOUTH -- and from a FRESH BITE WOUND ON
HER ARM -- SHE'S BEEN SUCKING HER OWN BLOOD -- !

Panicked, the Day Nurse suddenly REACHES OUT TO STOP HER --

DAY NURSE
Oh my God -- what are you-- ?!

BUT VIRGINIA’S SKIN IMMEDIATELY BEGINS TO BLISTER AND SMOKE
IN THE DAYLIGHT! SHE SCREAMS IN AGONY and -- just as the Day
Nurse GRABS HER --

VIRGINIA SUDDENLY ERUPTS INTO FLAMES!!!

 

THE INFERNO QUICKLY ENGULFS THEM BOTH -- WE HEAR A CHORUS OF
THEIR SHRIEKING...! IT’S A PURE VISION OF HELL!

LARRY AND THE POLICEMAN
BURST IN from the hall -- the HEAT is so intense, they are

forced to stop dead in their tracks...! They stare
helplessly at the scene in complete shock and horror...!

INT. OWEN’S APARTMENT - KITCHEN/DINING AREA - NIGHT

TIGHT SHOTS: Reaching into the oven, Owen gasps, burning
himself trying to grab a tv dinner -- he waves his hand in
the air to cool it, reaches for a pot holder in a drawer --

A NOTE on the refrigerator reads: “HI SWEETIE, MEETING WITH
THE LAWYER TONIGHT. BE HOME LATER. THERE’S A POT PIE IN THE
FREEZER! I LOVE YOU! GOD BLESS! MOM.”

The TV is on nearby -- Owen isn’t even paying attention:
TV NEWSCASTER
One patient and a nurse died early
this morning when a five alarm fire
broke out on the tenth floor of
Littleton Memorial Hospital. The
cause of the fire is still unknown,
but authorities believe it may have
been electrical...
Owen sits, gets settled with his dinner just as --
There is a KNOCK at the door... MORSE CODE.
Owen stiffens... CUT TO:
THE FRONT DOOR

It opens, revealing Abby. She smiles hopefully:

ABBY
...Hey.
OWEN
(coolly)
...Hey.

They stand there awkwardly, Abby waiting to be invited in...
Finally, Owen opens the door a bit wider for her to enter...

She smiles uncomfortably...
ABBY
You... have to invite me in...
It’s your home...

A quiet taunt:

OWEN
What if I don’t...?
(then)
Why can’t you just come in...?

Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library

She looks at him, smile fading...

OWEN
Is there something in the way...?

She stares at him sorrowfully... Finally, she makes the
decision... Steels herself... Enters...

Owen shuts the door, and turns, waiting skeptically...

At first, nothing happens. She just stands there, rigid,
eyes fiercely locked on Owen's...

But then... slowly... something starts to happen... her

breathing becomes labored... and then, she starts to BLEED...
from her EYES... her NOSE... her MOUTH... her PORES...! She
BEGINS TO SHAKE, GRIMACING in UTTER TORMENT as BLOOD DRENCHES

 

her skin, her clothes -- ! IT LOOKS LIKE SHE’S DYING -- !
Horrified, Owen immediately regrets what he’s done -- lunges
forward, grabbing her shoulders -- !

OWEN

No! Stop! You can come IN!

Abby suddenly relaxes her muscles, relieved. Panicked, Owen
looks at her to see if the bleeding has stopped. It has. He
immediately hugs her tight. Closes his eyes...

He holds her; then, head on her shoulder, still catching his
breath, he ANXIOUSLY UTTERS the unthinkable:

OWEN
What if I didn’t say anything...?
Would you have just kept bleeding...?

ABBY
I knew you wouldn’t let me...

OWEN
(opens his eyes, afraid of
the thought)
.--But... what if I did...?
Abby finally closes her eyes, whispers quietly, simply:

ABBY
...I knew you wouldn’t.

INT. OWEN’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Owen sits on the couch, staring up at Abby who stands before
him, clothes covered in blood. Owen is still reeling:

...Who are you...?

Beat. She looks at him, a defiant look in her eye...

ABBY
.--I’m just like you.

OWEN
What do you mean?

Abby stares at him, her demeanor changing... she steps
forward, hovering menacingly, brandishing an imaginary

ABBY
What’s the matter? Are you scared?
Are you scared, little girl? Huh?

OWEN
(suddenly afraid)
...What are you doing...?

ABBY
Those are the first words I ever
heard you say. Outside.

Beat. Owen grows self-conscious.

OWEN
Yeah, but... I don’t kill
people...

ABBY

But you’d like to, if you could...
To get back at them... Right?

 

OWEN
(quiet, grudging)
...Yeah...

ABBY
To get revenge --

OWEN
Because they hurt me, because I --

ABBY
Because you want to live. Just
like me.
(then)
I do it because I have to. To
survive.

She looks at him, becoming serious, quietly pleading:

Owen... Be me a little...
She moves very close to Owen, reaches out, touches his face --
CLOSE ON OWEN’S EYES

AS HE SUDDENLY SEES QUICK FLASHES OF A VISION:

 

We HEAR Owen and Abby QUIETLY BREATHING as we FLEETINGLY SEE --
DEMONIC EYES STARING at us -- !
A TWISTED MOUTH OPENS, BARING ITS TERRIBLE FANGS -- !
ABBY (V.O.) (CONT’D)
(whispers, emotional)
Please... For a little while...
A CHILD'S SHOULDER IS RAVAGED FIERCELY BY THE TEETH -- !
THE CHILD’S FEET KICK AND THRASH IN TERROR AND PAIN -- !

ABBY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Be me...

SUDDENLY, WE SEE THE CHILD’S FACE -- IT’S ABBY -- !
EYES RED, STREAMING WITH TEARS, A LOOK OF UNSPEAKABLE PAIN -- !
IT’S THE MOMENT SHE BECAME A VAMPIRE -- SO MANY YEARS AGO!

BUT AS HER MOUTH OPENS, ABOUT TO SCREAM -- IT’S OWEN’S SCREAM
WE HEAR, AS IF HE’S SCREAMING HER SCREAM, FEELING HER PAIN...!

REVEAL OWEN --
Back in the living room. His eyes red with tears.

WE CATCH A FLEETING GLIMPSE OF ABBY'S EYES, ANCIENT, TIRED --
but before they fully register, they are a child’s again...

Owen and Abby stare at each other. Silent. Emotional.

Owen raises his hand, unconsciously rubs his shoulder, in the
same spot where Abby was bitten in the vision...

WASHING BLOOD into the drain...

OWEN
still in the living room, deep in thought, the experience he

just had resonating in his head. We can HEAR the SHOWER
RUNNING in the background.

HOLD.
Then --
CUT TO:
A RECORD PLAYER
Owen’s hand sets down the needle... The Romantics’ “What I

Like About You” starts to play -- LOUD -- we are:
INT. OWEN’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Owen puts his hands in his pockets, listens to the music,
bopping his head subtly, walking around the room. He is
setting a mood, trying to be nonchalant. He spies a quick
look down the hall to see if Abby’s out of the shower yet.

A moment later, Abby appears, wrapped in a towel, clutching
her bloody clothes. She slows, hearing the music. Glances
at Owen. Smiles appreciatively. Bops her head a little too.

Owen sidles up to her, hands still in his pockets. He has to
yell over the music -- gestures toward his mom’s bedroom --

OWEN
You can borrow one of my mom's old
dresses if you want...!

Abby looks at him, nods appreciatively, and disappears into
the bedroom. Owen watches her go...

After a moment, Owen approaches the bedroom doorway, drawn --
CLOSE ON HIM as he PEEKS in, curious -- catches a FLEETING
GLIMPSE of ABBY dressing -- momentarily transfixed -- but --

Before she can catch him, he ducks out of the doorway again --
walks back into the middle of the room...

Abby emerges in an old, out of date dress, smiling. She
spins shyly, modeling it for Owen; the first time we’ve seen
her in a dress, she looks adorable. Owen smiles, blushing at
the sight of her -- when --

We HEAR the FRONT DOOR SLAMMING --

OWEN’S MOTHER (0.S.)
Hello...!

Panicked, Owen grabs Abby’s wrist, her bloody clothes, and
they run into --

OWEN’S ROOM

Abby runs straight for the window, opens it up -- she goes
right out on the ledge, without hesitation --

OWEN’S MOTHER (0.S.)
Owen...?! Where are you...?!

Alarmed, Owen turns toward his door --

OWEN
I’m in here...! I’1l be right
there...!
He turns back to the window -- and Abby is already gone. A

bit stunned, he sticks his head --
OUT THE WINDOW

To see Abby, impossibly, already sticking her head out her
window, next door. She smiles at him. He smiles back.

INT. ABBY’S APARTMENT - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Abby sits on the floor in her darkened apartment, playing
with her puzzles... bored... lonely... She stops for a
moment, stares a bit longingly at the wall that adjoins
Owen’s apartment...

INT. OWEN’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Owen stands looking at his mother who lies, out of focus,
passed out on the couch. The only light in the room is the
blue pulsing from the TV SCREEN. He stares to make sure his
mom is completely asleep as he slowly, silently pulls on his
jacket... Finally, he tip toes past her, OUT OF FRAME...

As we HEAR the FRONT DOOR QUIETLY OPENING, we CUT CLOSE ON
the TELEVISION; it’s a local PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT:

early morning... The car slows to a stop... Wind howls...

CUT TO:
A LONG ROW OF METAL APARTMENT MAILBOXES
as we MOVE ALONG them, hearing FOOTSTEPS... We STOP on ONE:
there is no name label, just the old glue from names past...
A SHADOW falls over the mailbox as the FOOTSTEPS QUIET. We
can see a distorted reflection in the metal, as a FIGURE
stares at the mailbox; but it’s too distorted to recognize...

More FOOTSTEPS, snow crunching underfoot as the CAMERA CREEPS

The CAMERA STOPS... So do the FOOTSTEPS...

THE REVERSE ANGLE - POV LOOKING DOWN FROM ABBY’S WINDOW

THE SMALL TOWN POLICEMAN stares up at us forebodingly as he
stands in the courtyard, beside the empty jungle gym...

INT. ABBY’S APARTMENT - DINING ROOM - EARLY MORNING

Lying in the middle of the floor, covered in a blanket,
surrounded by puzzles, Owen wakes up. Still fully dressed,
he looks around, disoriented. Abby is not there.

He spots a NOTE on the table: “Hi, Owen. Good morning. I am
in the bathroom. Please do not come in. Want to hang out
with me again tonight? I really like you. Love, Abby.”

Suddenly, there’s a LOUD KNOCK at the front door. Owen
turns. He gets up, moves very quietly into --

Owen FREEZES, doesn’t know what to do... He takes a step
backward, and the floorboard makes a long, sustained CREAK
underfoot...!
OUTSIDE
The Policeman turns, hearing the creak... knows someone is
inside -- he BANGS even harder on the door --

POLICEMAN

Hello?! This is Littleton P.D.!
(bangs again)
HELLO?! OPEN THE DOOR!
OWEN
stands there, stiff, trying not to make a sound, WHEN --

suddenly DRAWS HIS GUN, raises his foot -- and SLAMS HIS HEEL

The Policeman appears in the doorway to the kitchen, RIGHT
NEXT to where Owen’s back is pressed -- we can see them both,
but they cannot see each other...!

Owen holds his breath, can feel the Policeman standing
nearby... The Policeman GAZES in... then... moves on...

 

Owen listens as he passes... then, he gathers courage, darts
his head near the door jam and PEEKS:

INTO THE DINING ROOM

where the Policeman continues his sweep... He spots BOXES on
the side of the room, peers in, but it’s too dark to see...

Owen watches with just one eye past the door frame as the
Policeman takes a hand off his gun, and reaches up to the
cardboard and blankets covering the window -- he YANKS a
small section away, LETTING SOME LIGHT into the room...

 

The Policeman looks back in the boxes, sees the WALLETS,
WATCHES, and CASH... Then he sees SOMETHING BALLED UP on the
floor, nudges it into the light with his foot -- it’s ABBY’S
BLOOD DRENCHED CLOTHING; the Policeman looks at the blood

with growing alarm, imagining the worst -- he puts both hands
firmly back on his gun -- fear creeping into his voice:
POLICEMAN
HELLO...?!

Owen watches in horror as --
THE POLICEMAN

turns, spotting Abby’s NOTE near the table... He reaches
with one hand, picks it up... reads it... LOOKS UP AT --

THE CLOSED BATHROOM DOOR

Owen literally stops breathing for a moment, staring with
dread as the Policeman RAISES HIS GUN, and STARTS SLOWLY DOWN
THE HALLWAY, TOWARDS IT...

THE POLICEMAN’S POV

MOVING FOR THE DOOR... We can HEAR his MEASURED BREATHING as
he CLOSES IN...

OWEN

LEANS his head out into the darkened hallway, watching the
Policeman’s back as he creeps away, finally ARRIVING --

AT THE DOOR

The Policeman listens for noise from inside, hears nothing...
He reaches a hand down to the KNOB, gently grips it... tries
to TURN it slowly... it MOVES...

ALL AT ONCE, he FLINGS OPEN THE DOOR, GRIPS HIS GUN IN BOTH
HANDS, AND GAZES IN -- !

It’s even DARKER inside... He REACHES A HAND IN, feeling
around for a light switch -- finds one, FLICKS IT: nothing...

So finally, he STEPS ABRUPTLY --
INSIDE

looks around, trying to see in the darkness... As his eyes
adjust slightly, he can just make out --

AN OLD, STAINED BLANKET

spread over the top of the BATHTUB... He leans in closer,
still holding the gun... the STAINS look like BLOOD.

He reaches a hand free from his gun, and quickly LIFTS off
the blanket... underneath are MORE BLANKETS, wrapped around

something in the tub -- something shaped like a BODY...
The Policeman quickly PEELS those back too -- revealing ABBY.

He stares at her, moves his face close, cannot tell if she is
dead or alive... He glances above the tub, now able to see
that the BATHROOM WINDOW is thoroughly covered with CARDBOARD
and BLANKETS, SEALED along the sill with ELECTRICAL TAPE...

He reaches a hand up, feeling for the edge of the tape --
finds it -- and -- JUST AS he STARTS TO TEAR IT BACK --
LETTING A TINY BIT OF LIGHT IN -- A VOICE CRIES OUT -- AT THE
VERY SAME INSTANT, ABBY'S EYES OPEN, PAINED BY THE LIGHT AS
HER ARM SIZZLES -- !

 

OWEN (0.S.)
NO! STOP!

Startled, terribly on edge, the Policeman turns, levelling
his GUN at OWEN, standing in the HALLWAY behind him -- !

POLICEMAN
(spooked, breathless)
Christ Almighty, son -- !

-- AND BEFORE HE CAN FINISH, ABBY LEAPS UP FROM THE TUB AND
ATTACKS HIM FROM BEHIND, SINKING HER TEETH INTO HIS NECK!!!

 

Owen watches, horrified, as the Policeman FLAILS VIOLENTLY,
BLOOD SPRAYING as ABBY FEASTS GRUESOMELY, VICIOUSLY --

THE GUN CLATTERS to the linoleum -- !

THE POLICEMAN GRABS A BLOODY HAND on the door frame to keep
from collapsing -- his TERROR-FILLED EYES LOOK UP, LOCK ON
OWEN’S as he REACHES HIS OTHER HAND OUT -- PLEADING FOR
OWEN’S HELP -- !

 

OWEN stares back, TORTURED...

Unconsciously, Owen’s HAND STARTS TO LIFT... REACH OUT...

HE STEPS SLOWLY TOWARD THE BATHROOM...

The Policeman SEES OWEN’S HAND, REACHING in his direction -- !
His BLOODY HAND LOSES ITS GRIP on the door frame, and he
stumbles backward -- BUT HE PERSEVERES, STILL REACHING
DESPERATELY WITH HIS OTHER HAND FOR OWEN’S -- WHEN IT SUDDENLY
DAWNS ON HIM THAT OWEN IS REACHING FOR --

THE DOORKNOB

OWEN GRABS IT, YANKS -- AS THE POLICEMAN SCREAMS IN HORROR --

POLICEMAN
NoO-- !

AND THE DOOR SLAMS SHUT -- SEALING THE POLICEMAN’S FATE!

Owen backs away from the door in complete terror, listening
to the HORRIBLE SCREAMING AND BANGING from behind the door...

It’s unbearable -- he TURNS AWAY, TREMBLING...

Finally, he has to cover his ears...

We HEAR GURGLING, and then the tell-tale SNAPPING of the
Policeman’s neck -- and all of a sudden, everything goes --

SILENT.
HOLD.

Abby emerges from the bathroom, still wearing Owen’s mother’s
old dress from last night; she has blood all over her face.

Owen lowers his hands from his ears, stands there, stunned...

Abby walks up behind him, puts her arms gently around his
body. Her expression is mournful, no sense of victory at
all... she utters sadly, holding him tight:

ABBY
Thanks...

TIMECUT TO:
THE HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
Owen and Abby stare at each other, silent... A pained sense
of what is coming... Neither sure what to say... Finally,

Abby, the more experienced of the two, speaks softly, crushed:

ABBY
Owen... I have to go away...

Owen looks at her, at a loss, vulnerable... knows she’s
right... but can’t even nod...

She stares into his eyes... it’s excruciating...

Then, she leans slowly toward him, and for the first time,
despite her blood-drenched lips, they KISS... a long, last,
tender embrace...

Finally, they part, blood now on Owen’s lips too... He stares
at his feet, sadly, knowing it is over... she does too...

Michael Andrews and Gary Jules’ soulful cover of Tears for
Fears’ 1982 hit, “MAD WORLD” starts to play as we CUT TO:

INT. OWEN’S APARTMENT - MORNING

Owen walks in the door and Owen’s mother -- in the other room
-- immediately rushes over, hysterical, beginning to cry --

OWEN’S MOTHER (0.S.)
Oh my God -- !

She’s angry, emotional, relieved, all at the same time; she
grabs him by the shoulders, crouches down right in front of
him -- but we are ON OWEN’S FACE --

OWEN’S MOTHER (0.S.)
Oh my God!
(squeezes him tight)
Don’t ever do that again! Where
were you?! Where were you?!

Owen stares off as she holds him, his mind so far away:

OWEN
..-with a friend...

HOLD... “MAD WORLD” CONTINUES -- CUT TO:
INT. OWEN’S ROOM - NIGHT
Owen sits at his desk with his book of clippings... in front
of him is the latest NEWSPAPER ARTICLE to add to the bunch --
the GIANT HEADLINE reads: “WHO WAS HE?” The sub-headline
continues, “’RITUAL KILLER’ SUSPECT STILL UNIDENTIFIED AFTER
SUICIDE”; the POLICE SKETCH OF THE BALDING MAN is pictured...
Owen gazes at his desk, dispirited, no longer interested in
his clippings, when he HEARS A CAR DOOR SLAM... Suddenly, he
fills with trepidation, stands up, moves to the window to SEE:
A SILHOUETTED TAXI
IDLING in the driveway between buildings. A FIGURE finishes
putting a LARGE SUITCASE into the trunk... comes around,
opens the passenger door for a SMALLER SILHOUETTED FIGURE who
sits in -- Owen sees the outline of a tiny BARE FOOT as it
lifts up into the car, just before the door closes...
PUSHING IN, CLOSE ON OWEN

as he watches the TAXI pull away... disappear in the
distance... So overwhelmed, he can’t even cry yet...

“MAD WORLD” CONTINUES, OVER...

INT. ABBY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

THE CAMERA MOVES THROUGH the HAUNTINGLY EMPTY SPACE...
She’s gone...

INT. BASEMENT CLUBHOUSE - NIGHT

CAMERA MOVES PAST the words, “ENTER UPON PENALTY OF DEATH”...
into the DESERTED CLUBHOUSE...

PAST the OLD ARMCHAIR and CASETTE PLAYER...

PAST the PING PONG TABLE...

The CAMERA FINALLY COMES TO REST ON something slumped in a
dark corner of the room, hidden behind the sunken couch...

It’s the POLICEMAN’S BODY...

And, as “MAD WORLD” comes to an end, we CUT TO:

EXT. APARTMENT COURTYARD - MORNING
The JUNGLE GYM sits empty, surrounded by snow.
VERY CLOSE ON OWEN’S FACE

Nose pressed behind the fogging glass of his window, staring
down at the courtyard. Now he’s crying...

We HOLD in SILENCE as tears stream down his sad,
expressionless face...

After a long moment, the PHONE RINGS behind him...
He doesn’t move...

It RINGS again...

...and AGAIN...

He turns, shuffles off to go get it...

INT. OWEN’S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - MORNING

Owen picks up the phone. Doesn’t even say hello.

MARK (PHONE FILTER)
Hello...? Is Owen there...?

OWEN
Yeah...

MARK (PHONE FILTER)
Hey Owen, it’s Mark. Mr. Zoric
wanted me to call. He wants to
know if you’re coming tonight.

OWEN
Why does he want to know...?

MARK (PHONE FILTER)
I dunno. I guess coz you haven't
been coming the last few days...

OWEN
Oh. I’m not really sure.

MARK (PHONE FILTER)
Ok. Hey, Owen... By the way... I
think what you did to Kenny was
good. He deserved it.

OWEN
«--You do...?

MARK (PHONE FILTER)
Yeah. Just so you know.
Owen takes this in... a ray of hope that things can change...
EXT. PHONEBOOTH - AT THAT SAME MOMENT

Mark waits on the line, listening to see if Owen is buying
this... Outside the glass, Donald, Kenny, and Kenny’s Older

 

Brother watch...

MARK
(finally, into phone)
Well... Then maybe I’1l see you

tonight, huh?

OWEN (PHONE FILTER)
...Yeah.

Mark glances over at the others, nods...
EXT. MIDDLE SCHOOL POOL BUILDING - TWILIGHT

Warm light emanates through the windows from inside as SNOW
drifts down all around...

INT. LOCKER ROOM —- TWILIGHT

Owen finishes getting into his work out clothes -- a t-shirt
and bathing suit -- when a warm voice greets him --

MR. ZORIC (0.S.)
Ah! Speak of devil! There he is!

Owen looks up to see Mr. Zoric smiling at him; Owen smiles:

OWEN
Hi...

MR. ZORIC
(pats Owen’s shoulder)
Good to see you. We start in pool
today.

And he heads out of the locker room. Owen grabs his towel,
and starts out too, when he runs into Mark -- who stands
there awkwardly, almost as if he were waiting for Owen:
MARK
(smiles)
Hey, Owen...

Owen regards him warily, nods, and heads out --

Mark watches him go...

Then he walks across, steps over to an EXIT DOOR; he cracks it
open, sticks his head out -- WHISPERS to someone out there:

MARK
He’s here...

EXT. BACK OF MIDDLE SCHOOL POOL BUILDING - NIGHT
TIGHT SHOTS -- as the wind howls, and snow swirls -- Kenny
and Donald douse an overflowing DUMPSTER with KEROSINE...
laughing quietly, shushing each other --
KENNY’S BROTHER (0.S.)
(hushed)

Hurry up...!
INT. INDOOR MIDDLE SCHOOL POOL - NIGHT
Owen holds the edge of the pool, treading water as Mr. Zoric
stands above him, supervising -- Owen breathes in, lowers his
face into the water, breathes out... in... out... in...

MR. ZORIC
That’s it... that’s good...!

Mark runs up behind Zoric -- out of breath --

MARK
Mr. Zoric -- there’s a fire!

MR. ZORIC
(turns, alarmed)
What?!

MARK
Outside! In back!

Zoric nods -- turns back --

MR. ZORIC
Owen, I be right back!

Owen, slows, nodding, as Zoric abruptly heads off... Owen
looks up at Mark, who glances at him, then averts his eyes,
walking away in the direction Zoric went...

EXT. BACK OF MIDDLE SCHOOL POOL BUILDING - NIGHT

The dumpster is ABLAZE, flames reaching into the sky -- no
one in sight --

INT. MIDDLE SCHOOL POOL BUILDING - HALLWAY - NIGHT

Zoric rushes for the exit doors, disappears through them --
we HOLD for a moment... someone steps out from hiding... it’s
Kenny’s Brother. He walks up to the doors... SNAPS the
DEADBOLT into place, locking Zoric out...

INT. INDOOR MIDDLE SCHOOL POOL - NIGHT

Owen continues treading water on the side of the pool, when
suddenly he HEARS YELLING -- his eyes widen seeing Kenny's
Brother, Kenny, Donald and Mark storming into the room --
heading straight for him along the edge of the pool --

KENNY’S BROTHER
Everybody out! Move! lLet’s GO!

Frightened, KIDS climb out of the pool, scampering away --

Owen panics -- lifts himself out -- and RUNS MADLY -- for the
LOCKER ROOM -- !

The bullies FOLLOW -- !

IN THE LOCKER ROOM

Owen skids on wet feet in front of his locker -- SPINS the
TUMBLER -- he rips open the door, digging frantically into
his pants -- he finds his PEN KNIFE -- OPENS IT -- TURNS --
JUST AS -- Kenny’s Brother, Kenny, Donald, and Mark all

stumble into the room, converge around him...

Owen looks at them, holding his little pen knife, trembling,
shivering as he drips in his bathing suit...

Kenny’s Brother smiles --

KENNY’S BROTHER
What are you gonna do with that...?

He starts slowly toward Owen, who raises the knife, his hand
visibly shaking... As Kenny’s Brother closes in, Owen stares
at him, suddenly realizes he just can’t do it -- and attempts
to make a break, ploughing straight into Kenny -- who GRABS
him -- they ALL GRAB HIM!

Kenny’s Brother easily snatches the pen knife out of Owen’s
grip! Then, he SEIZES one of Owen’s legs, and begins
VICIOUSLY DRAGGING HIM out of the locker room -- Owen SQUIRMS
in pain and panic -- as the others follow -- !

BACK INTO THE POOL AREA

Kenny’s Brother drags him straight toward the pool -- calls
out to Kenny and Donald --

KENNY’S BROTHER
Grab his arms! Get his arms!

They do, and the three of them suddenly LIFT OWEN UP, and
TOSS HIM INTO THE DEEP END OF THE POOL --

OWEN’S POV

PLUNGING into the water! He FLAILS MADLY, unable to SWIM!

He GAGS VIOLENTLY, BOBBING his head in and out of the water,
GULPING for air...! Finally, he manages to latch a hand onto
the edge of the pool... He pulls his head up, just out of
the water, coughing...

Kenny’s Brother’s feet appear beside him, and he crouches
down next to Owen’s face, holding Owen’s pen knife... He
grabs Owen by the hair with his free hand -- Owen WINCES --

KENNY’S BROTHER
(quietly)
Know who I am...?

Owen looks at him, terrified... nods yes...

KENNY’S BROTHER
Good. Then you know why I’m here.

He stares at Owen. Smiles.

KENNY’S BROTHER
We’re gonna have a little contest.
Okay? You stay under water for...
three minutes.

He moves the knife closer to Owen’s face...

KENNY’S BROTHER
If you can do it, I’ll just give
you a little nick. On your cheek.
But if you can’t... I’1l poke out
one of your eyes. Got it? An eye
for an ear.

Owen looks at him, filling with dread...

OWEN
But... that’s impossible...

KENNY’S BROTHER
That’s your problem...
Kenny, still wearing a big bandage on his ear, steps closer
over his brother’s shoulder, getting a good look at Owen...
He glowers at him, preparing for revenge...
Kenny’s Brother grips Owen’s hair hard; Owen grimaces --
KENNY’S BROTHER
Three minutes. Better take a deep

breath --

Owen starts to SUCK AIR IN -- AS -- WITHOUT WARNING -—
Kenny’s Brother FORCES OWEN’S HEAD --

UNDER WATER

Owen PLUNGES DOWN, EYES WIDE OPEN, his CHEEKS PUFFED with
air...! BUBBLES trickle from his lips...

KENNY

stares on bitterly as his brother holds Owen down...

Seeing Owen’s arms flailing slightly under the water, Donald
and Mark exchange a look, suddenly worried that this may get
out of hand... Mark looks at --

THE LARGE CHRONOMETER

on the wall... as the SECOND HAND slowly sweeps...

UNDER WATER

Owen starts to make WHINING sounds, struggling to hold his
breath... Panic fills his eyes -- a STREAM OF BUBBLES
flushes from his mouth --

THE BUBBLES

APPEAR on the water’s surface, above Owen’s head -- seeing
them, Kenny finally starts to get nervous too --

KENNY
(quietly)
Okay, Jimmy...

KENNY’S BROTHER
Shut up!

Beat, as they wait a bit longer; then --

DONALD
C’mon, man, this is stupid --

KENNY’S BROTHER
I said shut up!

They all STARE SILENTLY; it’s starting to go too far...

UNDER WATER

Owen is turning red... it doesn’t look like he can last much
longer -- when SUDDENLY -- we hear a MUFFLED CRASH from above
water -- UNSEEN BY OWEN -- a SHADOW SWEEPS through the center

of the pool behind him -- as if something were flying over
the surface of the water -- we MOVE IN CLOSE ON OWEN’S EYES --

OWEN’S POV - SHALLOW FOCUS

staring into the CLEAR BLUE WATER -- we BARELY hear what

 

could be SCREAMS from above the pool -- and we begin to SEE
BLOODY CLOUDS BILLOWING DOWN from the surface -- this is the
same exact image from OWEN’S NIGHTMARES -- THEY HAVE ALL BEEN

 

A _PREMONITION OF THIS VERY MOMENT -- !!1!

 

Something OUT OF FOCUS DRIFTS DOWN into view -- it is KENNY’S
BROTHER'S SEVERED HEAD -- !!!

BACK ON OWEN’S FACE

as he SEES it! Behind him, a PAIR OF WILDLY KICKING LEGS ARE
SUDDENLY DRAGGED just below the surface of the water, all the
way across the pool, TRAILING CLOUDS OF BLOOD as they go -- !
AT THE SAME TIME -- KENNY’S BROTHER’S HEADLESS BODY SLUMPS
into the pool, right in front of Owen -- and the GRIP on
OWEN’S HEAD is RELEASED -- !

OWEN

SURGES to the SURFACE, COUGHING FOR AIR, SLAPPING MADLY at
the water -- he GRABS the WALL -- !

WE STAY CLOSE ON HIM AS HE GASPS FOR AIR, PANTING HARD, EYES
SHUT! All around him we HEAR OFF-SCREEN SCREAMING, MAYHEM,

SPLASHING -- ! Then all at once, it finally STOPS.

We hear only the sound of Owen, as his breathing slows...

A FIGURE quietly moves up next to him in the water... He
opens his eyes, SEES --

ABBY’S FACE

inches from his, eyes staring lovingly at him to make sure he
is okay... Flecks of blood and water spatter her face...
She is like a vision.

Owen smiles at the sight of her. She smiles back. Finally,
she reaches over, takes his hand in both of hers, presses it
to her cheek. Closes her eyes.

CUT TO:
THE POOL - HIGH, WIDE SHOT - MOMENTS LATER
A tableau of the bloody aftermath. The bullies’ bodies lie

scattered about along the edges, and inside the pool. The
water is still settling. Owen and Abby are gone.

HOLD.
Then --
CUT TO:
A MOVING SHOT, DOWN THE AISLE OF A PASSENGER TRAIN
We're FOLLOWING on the back of a TRAIN CONDUCTOR... He stops,
FINDING OWEN, alone in his seat, backpack at his side --
CONDUCTOR
Scuse me, son... can I see your

ticket?
Owen hands it over. The conductor checks it, then looks down
at the floor, seeing a LARGE, CARDBOARD CARTON among a few
other items of luggage; the carton stretches into the aisle --

CONDUCTOR
That yours...?

Owen nods. The Conductor looks at it, slightly annoyed, but

then just walks off... Owen stares out the window.
Beat.
A QUIET KNOCKING begins... from inside the box. MORSE CODE.

Owen looks at the carton, smiles. He begins TAPPING a
message back as the TRAIN STARTS TO MOVE...

Then he turns back to the window, looking out as the TRAIN
GATHERS SPEED... Outside it is SUNRISE.

He takes out a piece of candy from his backpack, puts it in
his mouth, watching as the world moves past, his BACK TO US...

OWEN
(sings quietly)
Eat some now, save some for later...
He’s leaving his old life... for another...
We see his FACE REFLECTED in the window: he looks emotional.
OWEN
(sings quieter still)
Eat some now, save some for later...
And, as the TRAIN’S HORN RINGS OUT, BUILDING -- we SUDDENLY --
CUT TO BLACK.

THE END.
