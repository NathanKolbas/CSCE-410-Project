Draft 42 - Feb. 15, 13964

FADE IN:

Our picture opens on a fairly distant shot of The Island,
lonely, sun-speckled yet mist-dim, somehow unsubstantial.
Slowly, the CAMERA moves closer as a man's voice sreaxs.
It is a Highlander's soft voice.

CAMERON (0.s.)

Well, there it iss. The Island.
A mossy bank, a soft bit of sod,
@ spot to rest your oars and sit
and sun yourself a spell. Some-
how the sun does seem to favor
the place. A toy island...a wee
insignificant bit of grass and
stone...as tranquil looking a
Piece of real estate as anyone
could fancy. Stop! Stop here!

 

THE CAMERA obeys.

CAMERON (cont'd) (o.s.)
We'll go no closer. Not again.
Not efer again.
(draws a deep breath)

iss its name in Gaelic. In .
English it means The Island That
Likes to be Pisited.

(his voice deeply ironic)
Fisited indeed. There are those
who hafe found the island hos-
pitable to a fault. There are
those who hafe found the island...
hungry... for fisitors...

That

FADE IN:

LONG SHOT, HIGH, of a country house, not really isolated,

but somehow alienated from its neighbors, It is run-down,

neglected, empty and...even in the light of mid-afternoon...

. dark. Over this scene we once more hear the 0.S, voice of
CAMERON.

CAMERON (0.8.)
(sighing)
Yes...another choice bit of real
estate. But here...there is no
invitation here... no beckoning...

CAMERON (cont'd) (o.s.)
no wanting to be fisited. And yet
this house...this house and the
Island are for all time linked
most tragically together...

The voice fades as a jeep, vintage World War II, comes
down the road, slowing down and finally stopping in front
of the house. The CAMERA closes in and by the time the
back door opens and a man, an American officer in battle
dress, gets out of the car, we are in MEDIUM CLOSE-UP.
The man turns and faces the house as if confronting it.
His eyes narrow speculatively as he slowly, Geliberately,
takes in the dark decay of the place, the ‘FOR SALE' sign,
itself now old and forlornly awry on its base.

At last the man moves across the weedy stretch of lawn,
mounts the steps, starts to knock, changes his mind and
tries the door. It opens easily, and he steps into the
house, closing the door gently behind him.

He finds himself in a small entrance hall. On either side
of him are closed-off rooms. Before him is a staircase
curving gracefully upward. A pale light dimly penetrates
the dirty fanlight above the door, making it possible for
the man...and for us...to make out the gracious lines of
the architecture. Even now, in this sorry stete, one can
imagine how inviting, how warm, this small manor house
must once have been.

Without haste, the man takes in the sight, the ambiance.
But, though unhurried, he wastes no time, for his interest,
his focus of attention, seems to be on the staircase and
on the unseen floor above.

Slowly, he begins to mount the stairs. At the top, he
discovers a door, open upon a dark and deeply silent room.
Quietly, he enters. All of this room's past, which can be
taken away, has gone. Such light as there is...no more
than enough to make shadows...comes from the only window,
which is at the back and incompletely shrouded in sacking.
Also toward the back of the room is another door.- It is
closed. As his eyes adjust to the dark, they circle the
room, taking in the peeling wallpaper, the desolated,
deserted sadness of it all, until finally his eyes came to
rest upon the only furnishings in the room... if two up-
ended packing cases and a chair may be called furnishings.

On top of one of the cases is an unlighted candle ina
holder, and beside it is a chair, the back of which is
turned toward the man. These objects seem only to add

to the impression of empty desertion. And then, in the
dark, the man becomes slowly conscious of the faintest,
“almost indiscernible movement. It is in the chair. He
freezes. There is a moment of utterly suspended animation.
Then he speaks, his voice hardly a whisper.

KENNETH
Who's there?

THE CAMERA closes in tight on the chair, as from its
depth the movement takes shape and turns to face the man.
In the chair is a woman, old, gaunt, narrow-eyed...as
frightened by the man as he has been by her. Only when
her old gimlet eyes observe the obviously corporeal
Rature of the intruder, does she let out her breath.
Hostilely, she regards him.

MRS, OTERY
What do you think you're up to
here now: This here's private
property:

KENNETH 5
(relaxes, almost smiles)
And you must be the caretaker.
Your name is....?

MRS. OTERY
(compelled against
herself to answer
his gentle, but
utterly assured
command)
Mrs. Otery.

(trying to regain

her authority)
Mrs. Harry Otery, that's who.
And I’m in charge of this house.
It's my job to show it to
prospective purchasers with
appointments.

KENNETH
Really? From the looks of
things, I shouldn't think you'd
find yourself very busy.

Good for you, but aren't you

MRS, OTERY
I'm not one to waste good candle-

candle.

Be attempts to light candle, but the wick has burned too
low. He then removes a knife, a rather large, lethal-
looking instrument, from inside his jacket and with it
begins to carve the wick out of the wax.

MRS. OTERY
(at the sight
of the knife)
‘Bre now...what are you carrying
a wicked thing like that for?

KENNETH
As you rightfully pointed out,
Madam, there's a war on. Govern-
ment issue.

He now lights the candle and in its feeble, flickering
light, begins to look around the room. The light shows
MRS. OTERY nothing she has not already seen; her atten-
tion is still riveted on the knife. We follow KENNETE'S
examination of the room as MRS. OTERY speaks.

MRS, OTERY

Wot government? Knives is «

superbly romantic rat-holes.
{moves to window)
There's an apple tree outside
there, with one of its branches
scraping against the window...
(smiles)
It was my own private entrance
and exit...

He pulls aside the sacking, which lets in a little mors
light. We see that the window, which reaches to the
floor, opens outwards. There is, however, no tree. The
man stares in disappointment, lets out his breath.

KENNETH (cont'd)
Ah....

MRS. OTERY
Well, there was a tree, I
believe. You can sea the
root if you look down.

KENNETH

(at the window)
Yes. Yes, I see it in the
long grass. And a bit of the
seat that used to be around
it. There were blue curtains
at the window, and there was a
sofa at this end, and I had my
first swimming lessons on it.

sour, indifferent

be here drinking in these
moving memories.

She eyes him narrowly.

KENNETH (cont'd)

stairs, but the little door at the back has caught his
eye.

Why, yes. The villagers are

When I inquired about it, they
said the owners had to get a care~

in this house.

MRS. OTERY
A pack of cowards.

With a show of Patience, indifference even, he sits down
in the chair that MRS. OTERY had occupied. He taps out
his pipe, his eye first on the door, then deliberately
turned toward the delicate movement of the little fingers
of dying fire. As the fire burns lower, he sits quietly,
and in the increasing dusk, he ceases to be an intruder,
and his figure becanes indistinct and fades from sight.

When the haze lifts we are looking at the room as it was
some forty-five years ago on the serene afternoon that
began its troubled story. There are rooms that are always
Cheerful, and MRS. MORLAND'S little drawing-room is one of
them. It is furnished, as we have already heard, with the
blue curtains, the sofa on which KENNETH had his first
swimming lessons, the Peacocks on the wil, and the apple
tree is in full blossom at the Open window. One of the
tree's branches has even stepped into the room.

MR. MORLAND and the local clergyman, MR. AMY, are chatting
importantly about sane matter of no importance, while MRS.
MORLAND is on her sofa at the other side of the room. She
is knitting and she comes into the conversation occasionally
with a cough or a click of her needles. This is her
tactful way of telling her husband not to be so assertive to
his guest. All three people are slightly over forty years
of age. They are People who have found life to be, on the
whole, an easy and hapoy adventure. The squire is only a
@mall squire of very moderate means who passes life Pleasant-
ly and not unprofitably in being a J.P. and will discuss for
days or months the advisability of putting @pew roof on a
tenant's cowshed. Eventually, without his knowing it, his
wife will make up his mind for him. Even she does not know
she has done it. MRS. MORLAND is a delightful woman with
rather shrewder sense than her husband, and she has a joke
that has kept her merry through all her married life, viz.
her husband. She adores him, however, and they are an
extremely happy sociable couple. MR. AMY is even more
sociable than MR, MORLAND; he is reputed to know everyone

in the county, and has several times fallen off his horse
because he will salute all passers-by. On his visits to
London he usually returns depressed use there are so
many people in the streets to whom he may not give a° friendly
bow. He likes to read a book if he knows the residence of
&@ relative of the author, and at a Play it is far more to
him to learn that the actress has three children, one of

Yes, that's right. Scotch firs

out of which a small stream flows.
And it has hillocks and a glade,

is outlined finally against the rise of the hillock, then

once more in the MORLAND'S DRAWING-ROOM. The CAMERA'S
approach to the voices we hear (as. SIMON'S voice din-
inished as we moved away from him, so now do these voices
augment as we approach) is oblique, circling the room,
little changed from our last visi , until it comes to
rest...at last...on the three occupants. They are mR.
and MRS. MORLAND,and MR. AMY. Before we see them we hear
their talk. sR. MORLAND says,

 

MR. MORLAND (0.s.)
It's the sugar I mind most.
We haven't had a Proper puddin' in
weeks.

MR. AMY (0.8.)

(replies)
Well, personally L believe these
small sacrifices have been a bit
of a blessing in disguise. Since
I've had to walk about so much,
I've dropped a full stone...feel
like a boy. You would too, Janes,
if you followed in my footsteps
every day.

MR. MORLAND (0.s.)
I Caresay I feel as much a boy as
you, George.

Now, finally, the CAMERA Closes in on MORLAND, and we see
that he is now an old man. He is.still straight and lean,
but there is simply not the vigor and chestiness of fifty,
hor the look that all is still Possibly recoverable. His
hair is quite white, his complexion ruddier and veined,

MR. MORLAND (cont'd)

You never sa recisely what your
age is, Georke™ . ¥ ¥

MR. AMY
(He too is much aged,
but he doesn't carry
his age as well as

MR. MORLAND. He seems
to have shrunk)

They walk up the last few steps together curing the ensuing
Gialogue and reenter the DRAWING-ROOM, he to stop again by
the fire, she to where the old album lays.

MRS MORLAND
(smiles)
Nothing really. Just how
George wishes he were in the
Navy like Simon.

MR. MORLAND
Ha: At his age? He's getting
positively senile.

MRS. MORLAND has picked up the album and opened it. Her
smile doesn't altogether disappear, but it becomes pain-
fully poignant as she looks at the pictures. We, too,

see them, these faded images of the past, the color of
the present giving way to the sepia shades of memory,

The first one we see, at first glare might almost be the
one taken on KENNETH'S second birthday. But we must stay
with it long enough to take in the three candles on the
cake, MRS, MORLAND now occupying the place of the absent
MARY ROSE, and somewhat apert, unsmiling, SIMON, who is
looking not at the little boy on his birthday, but into
some distance of his own. The boy, KENNETH, is seen to
be fair and blue-eyed like his mother, and he has something
of her open gaze and look of innocent joy. This first
picture should be followed by several more...five or six...
all on KENNETH'S birthdays. MRS. MORLAND is always there.
SIMON is sometimes not. The pictures in which SIMON is
Present should reveal the estrangement between father and
son. They are never touching, never smiling at each
other, always separated by some person or thing. The last
shot should be dated 1914 and we should see SIMON in some
attitude indicating his role as warrior and KENNETH'S envy
and eagerness to join the company of men. Under the date
1915 there is no picture. Instead, in a firm hand should
be written the words, ‘Private Kenneth Moreland Blake,
Missing in Action.'

MR. MORLAND
Fanny, don't, my dear.

MRS. MORLAND -
I was just remembering how
lovely the apple tree is in bloom.

MR. MORLAND
But it must come down, Panny. It
has become a danger. It might
fall on someone any day. You know

is, at this moment, a deeply worrieé man as he gazes with
pity and compassion on the sleeping figzre which he is
guarding through this long night journey. The figure is,
of course, MARY ROSE. But she is in deep shadow, her
head averted. The figure moves; there is a faint moan.

field until he sees two dim figures cutting through the

walk. The thought of what his next steps might bring to
him are too awesome. But as his step slows, the slighter
of the two distant figures begins to move forward, gaining

itself into his rusty arms. ,

Aa if touched by some marvelous, forbidden enchantment,
Ro one moves or speaks. Only the sound of SIMON'S footsteps
at the top of the stairs, now entering the DRAWING-ROOM,
breaks the spell, causing MARY ROSE to look into her
mother's face for reassurance. She Sees, undeniadly sees,
the age. Slowly, her eyes move from MRS, MORLAND to
MR. MORLAND, where she finds again, the same inexplicable
Dlight. She turns from one face'to another, and on each
she sees deeply etched, in unaccountable lines, love, grief,

Her amile intact, MARY ROSE disengases herself from the

toward a wall mirror.

MARY ROSB (cont'd)

As if to straighten her hair, her appearance, MARY ROSE
forces her gaze into the mirror, quite unable to disguise
the trembling anxiety with which she regards her image.

She sees herself...lets out her breath...for it is really
herself, the self she knows. For an instant she goes slack
with relief, and a smile springs spontaneously to her lips.
It is shaky, but it is real. .

However, before she can turn back to face the others, she
sees in the mirror...his face reflected beside her own...
SIMON. And the nightmare is real, He is so mich older,
and she 1s not. Only she is unchanged. The others are
OLD and ALIEN. She whirls around, faces them like an
animal at bay.

She never rose from the chair. It is as though she were
dead long before the scream had finished making its relent-

as if the scream, triumphant in its monstrous birth, had
simply discarded what was left of her.

Of the figures in the tableau around the body of MARY ROSE,
only SIMON makes a pitiful little human gesture of protest
Gently he touches her pale, almost luminous cheek.. And when

he takes his hand away, his fingers, where they touched her,
are faintly blue. There is one small, awful, choked sound

from SIMON, as the scene fades. There is no further movement...

icy echos of the scream.

FADE IN:

And it is the still retounding weves of this echoed scream
that move now into the dusty old room where KENNETH sits
and waits in the dark, the fire and candle long since
guttered out. The little door at the beck opens slowly to
the extent of a foot. Thus might e breek of wind blow it
if there were any wind. Presently KENNETH rises Slowly to
his feet. He hears nothing; he sees nothing. But the feel
of the scream is with him. As he watches, the door
closes softly. Now he picks up the candle, relichts ait,
and with hardly a moment's irresolution, moves toward the
door. He opens it, crosses the short length of the hell
and now tries the final door. Easily, without a murmur of
protest, it opens for him. He holds the candle up, looking,
waiting... there is nothing. He lets out his breath, turns
back, slowly retracing his steps into the drawing-room.

And it is there, at last, that he is met by MARY ROSE. She
stends quietiy in the middle of the room, as if made out of
the light he has brought beck with him. She nods politely
and speaks.
