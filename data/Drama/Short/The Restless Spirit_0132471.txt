EXT, VARIOUS ANGLES - STAFF CAR - DAY

Drenched in the dazzling clear sunlight of a Spring day,
@ gleaming black staff-car winds its way along the back
roads of the rolling French countryside. An old grizzled
farmer looks up from plowing. A child waves from a
broken porch swing. red~cheeked, pregnant, peasant
girl idly watches the car pasa nearby.

DISSOLVE:

EXT, ELEGANT COUNTRY ESTATE - DAY

The headquarters of GENERAL ROUSSEAU, It is a lovely,
gracious place surrounded by well-kept tall hedges,
graceful willow trees and a sloping grassy lawn of
enormous BWeep, The staff-car swerves up the winding
gravel drive leading to the entrance, Everywhere in
evidence is the restrained bustle connected with a
military headquarters, Smartly uniformed ‘guards; small
.§roups of officers arriving and departing; dispatch
riders conversing with each other in hushed tones.

Waiting for the etaff-car are GENERAL ROUSSEAU'S two
aides, MAJORS SAINT-AUBAN and COUDERC, They politely
greet the occupants of the car, ARMY COMMANDER GENERAL
BROULARD, a trim, wiry old man with watery eyes, and his
aide, COLONEL DE GUERVILIE, a. fat, tall man in his

middle forties. The chauffeur hops out to open the door,

MAJ, SAINT-AUBAN
(saluting)
Good afternoon, General Broulard,
Major Saint-Auban, of General
Rousseau's staff, and this is
Major Couderc,

GEN, BROULARD
(exiting car)
How do you do, gentlemen.
This 1s Colonel de Guervilie.

COL, DE QUERVILLE
Gentlemen,

They ail stand uneasily at a loss for small talk.

MAJ. COUDERC
(nervously)
I hope your trip was pleasant,
Generel.

GEN. BROULARD
(straightening his
jacket)

Thank you, Colonel, It was quite
enjoyable...yes, the country's
quite beautiful this time of
year,

MAJ, SAINT-AUBAN
Well, if you'd like to come in-
side, sir, General Rousseau is
awaiting you in his office,

DISSOLVE:

INT, PLUSH SALON - DAY

Which has been converted into GENERAL ROUSSEAU'S office,
There are maps everywhere; on the wall, spread on the
table, folded on chairs and stacked on shelves. The
room is richly furnished in Louis XV, with thick carpets,
fine paintings and everywhere graced with art objects

of @11 kinds. GENERAL BROULARD wanders about the room
admiringly. GENERAL ROUSSEAU packs his pipe, thought-
fully. He is a friendly looking man, in his fifties.
Somewhat of a cat and mouse game appears to be in

progress.

GEN, BROULARD
Paul, you've done a wonderful
gob on this room,

GEN, ROUSSEAU
You're very kind, George, but
it's really pretty mich the way
I found it when the Blanchards
evacuated the place. I my have
added 4 touch here and there but
nothing really important,

(CONTINUED)
(CONTINUED - 1)

GEN, BROULARD
Well, Paul, say what you will,
but t prefer to believe that
your taste in carpets and pic-
tures is second to none.

GEN. ROUSSEA

(playing the game
Thank you -- I do think it's
important -- I mean the place
@ wan works, the way it looks.
The atmosphere of the room has
an effect on the man who works
in it.

GENERAL BROULARD scrutinizes an elegant vase resting on
&@ marble table top. Smiling to himself, he looks up
brightly and crosses the room to GENERAL ROUSSEAU'S
desk, seating himself comfortably in a leather chair,

GEN, BROUIARD

(complete change

of tone)
Paul, I've come to see you about
something big, It's top seoret
and it mustn't go further than
your chief of staff, and not to
him unless you can trust his
discretion.

GEN. ROUSSEAU
Of course.

GEN, BROULARD
A group of armies is forming on
this front for an offensive in
about three weeks, Joffre is
determined to make a complete
breakthrough. The latest word
seems to be that the Americans
are not coming into the war.
Apparently they don't seem to
mind having their ships torpedoed,
So it looks as though we won't be
getting any help, at least not
very Boon, anyway. Why are you
smiling?

GEN, ROUSSEAU
Oh, forgive me, go on, please.

(CONTINUED)
(CONTINUED - 2)

GEN, BROULARD
No, reAlly, I know it's silly
but I wish you'd tell me what
you Were smiling at,

GEN, ROUSSEAU
I'm really sorry, I didn't mean
to be rude. I just thought for
a@ moment that I imew what you
were about to say. Please go
on.

GEN, BROULARD
(pleasantly)
I never knew you were a mind
reader -- what did you think I
was about to say?

GEN, ROUSSEAU
(tentatively)
Something about the Ant Hi11?

GEN. BROULARD
You are a mind reader, Paul.

GEN. ROUSSEAU
Not really. It is a key position,
It's in my sector -~ and further-
more, to be perfectly honest, I've
heard some talk. You know nothing's
really a secret at headquarters.

GENERAL BROULARD studies GENERAL ROUSSEAU for a moment,
then he smiles pleasantly.

GEN, BROULARD
Well what do you think?

GEN, ROUSSEAU
About what?

GEN. BROULARD
About the Ant Hi11?

GEN, ROUSSEAU
I suppose just about the same
sort of things that everyone
else thinks about it. It's
the key to the whole German
position in this sector.
(continued)

(CONTINUED)
(CONTINUED - 3)

GEN, ROUSSEAU (cont'd)
That's not news to anyone, I'm
sure. It's a miniature
Gibralter, The Germans nave
heid onto it for over a year,
And I dare say that they know
what 1t's worth, too. They've
put a lot of work into seeing
that we don't take it away
from them,

GEN, BROULARD
(solemnly)
I saw Joffre yesterday, He gave
me formal orders to take the
Ant Hill no later than the tenth.
That's day after tomorrow,

( GEN, ROUSSEAU )
smiles patronizingly

I don't want to be disrespestful
to the old. boy but that kind of,
'I want 1t no later than the
tenth,! stuff comes very close
to being ridiculous, don't you
think?

GEN, BROULARD
(dtsappointed
I don't imagine I'd here if
I really thought that. Look,
Paul, we all know it's not
going to be a picnic -- but
then no one ever said it would,

ROUSSEAU smiles at him, politely. BROULARD returns the
smile and turns his attention to an ivory letter-opener.

GEN, BROULARD

I've entrusted this job to Sorel
and Swann already and they've
failed both times, [If there's
One min in this arny who can do
this for me, it's you, Paul. I'd
have called on you first but you
were up to your neck at Souchez,.

GEN, ROUSSEAU
You're very flattering, George,
but really, it's out of the
question -- absolutely out of

GEN, ROUSSEAU (cont'd)
the question. My division was
cut to pieces. What's left of
it 1s in no cormdition to even
hold the Ant Hill, let alone
take it. I'm sorry but that's
the truth, at least in oy
opinion,

BROULARD gets out of his chair and walks to the window,
He picks at a fleck of paint on the glass.

GEN, BROULARD
I'm sorry to hear you talk this
way. What I mean is, that as
your friend -- I shouldn't want
to see anything like this, no
matter how genuine it might be --

GEN. ROUSSEAU
(pleasantly)
What are you trying to say,
George?

GEN. BROULARD
Well, let's be honest with each
other, We alwaye have been, and
there's no reason why we should
start doing things any differently
now. You've got a right to know,
or perhaps I should say, as a
friend I have a right to tell you.

BROULARD faces around. His eyes fairly sparkle.

GEN, BROULARD
The talk about headquarters is
that you're being considered
for the twelfth corps - and
with that, another star. Now
we both know that you've got a
good enough record to be able to
refuse this order on the grounds
you've stated. No one would ques-
tion your decision and they'd get
someone else to do the job. But
then you know the way talk starts
about a thing like that. Of course
it's always by those rear echelon
commandos who wet their pants when
@ oar backfires -- but they've got
mouths, and they've got dirty
gossipy minds,

(CONTINUED)
(CONTINUED - 5)

ROUSSEAU smoothes back his hair, nervously. He moves to
& smll bar, .

GEN, ROUSSEAU
Would you like some cognac?

GEN, BROULARD
No thanks, I try not to start
before dinner, In fact the
doctors have been trying to get
me to lay off the stuff com-
pletely.

ROUSSEAU pours himself a brandy, replacing the cap of the
bottle with great precision. He drains the snifter
slowly. He looks at BROULARD with an idle expression
that seems to say, "All right, let's suppose I am
interested, what's the next move?"

GEN, ROUSSEAU
You're awfully clever, George.
But then you always have been,

GEN, BROULARD

(smiling)
But not clever enough, apparently.
A little transparent there at the
end, I was confident your judge-
ment wouldn't be swayed by an
appeal to your ambition, no mtter
how valid 14t might be. But you
can't blame me for trying, Frankly,
I'd have been disappointed if you
hadn't seen right through me.

GEN, ROUSSEAU

(solemly)
Well, I don't think I have to be
ashamed of the fact that I have
@ normal amount of ambition --
and that naturally I'm concerned
about my reputation at headquarters,
but there are other considerations,
I am responsible for the lives of
eight thousand men.

GEN, BROULARD
(kmows Rousseau is
hooked )
Of course you are, And I know you
wouldn't tackle a thing unlesa you
were sure that you were doing right
(continued )

(CONTINUED)
(CONTINUED ~ 6)

GEN. BROULARD (cont'd)
by those men, Now look -- just
suppose for the moment that you
were convinced, at least to the
point of your conscience being
clear, Now, if for some unlooked
for reason the thing didn't cone
off right -- well, at least you
gave it your all, The casualties
Will prove that, You did the
best you could. Perhaps your
division was under strength.
Perhaps it was tired. Its morale
was low. Perhaps, in retrospect,
it might appear they were not
really in the best shape to earry
the assault. But it wasn't your
idea, You simply did your best
to carry out orders, And further-
more, although I know this is of
secondary interest to you, I mst
take the risk of angering you by
pointing out that this would not
hurt your chances for the twe
corps. In fact, it would probably
help them,

ROUSSEAU lights up a cigar, first carefully snipping one
end with a cutter,

GEN. ROUSSEAU
How's artillery?

GEN, BROULARD
All you want.

ROUSSEAU savors his cigar.

GEN, ROUSSEAU
How about replacements,

GEN, BROULARD
(hopefully)
We'll see what we can do,

GEN, ROUSSEAU
When do you see this coming off?

GEN, BROULARD
No later than day after tomorrow,

ROUSSEAU lazily reaches across his cluttered desk for

EXT, COUNTRY ROAD = DAY - VARIOUS ANGLES

Establishing the 1¥ist Regiment dispiritedly slogging
back to the trenches, They are loaded down like pack
animals, Their uniforms look as though they had been
marinated in mud, The sky in the direction they are
marching 18 occasionally illuminated by a dim flash of
light foliowec a split second later by a dull boom.

The tramp of their feet is out of step = and this is
accentuated by the irregular clanking and banging of
their equipment. There are, ideally, about one
thousand men winding along the road in columns of fours,

THE HEAD OF THE COLUMN ~ COLONEL DAX AND CAPTAIN
RENOUART

COLONEL DAX 1s @ handsome min in his thirties - vigor-
ous and tanned by the weather, CAPTAIN RENOUART is a
young man in his late twenties, graced by the kind of
good looks that would go into mking a beautiful woman -
an elegantly trimmed moustache completes his face,

The two men walk & little apart from the rest and talk
in hushed tones, They have been talking before we come
upon them. COLONEL is noticeably annoyed. They
speak in low tones so as not to be overheard.

COL. DAX

Do you know your real trouble,
Captain Renouart? You're ego-
tistical. You've got a big head.
You're so sure the sun rises and
sets up there in your noggin you
don't even bother to carry matches,
Now let me ask you one question,
And believe me I'm entirely serious
about it. Do you think you're God?

CAPT, RENOUART

Of course I don't, Colonel,

COL, DAX
You're not infallible, then?
You're every bit as apt to be
wrong a8 any other human being?

CAPT, RENOUART

firmly

I'm not farm about the Ant Hill.
Anyone with @ brain in his head
would know that --

COL, DAX
And you've got the only brain in
the world, They made yours and
threw the pattern away? The rest
of us have a skullful of corn-
flakes,

CAPT, RENOUART
Look, I know I don't have that
wonderful legal mind of yours,
You can twist everything --

COL, DAX
All right, you say it's impossible.
The best military minds in France
think it's possible, but you don't,
Both times other outfits have been
cut to pieces. Now we're given the
job. We're under strength and
we're battle weary, It mkes no
sense at all.

CAPT, RENOUART
Right.

COL. DAX
But what conclusion can we
justifiably draw from all of
that? Difficult? -- yes.
Small chance for success? -=
yes. Possibility of great
casualties? -- yes. No apparent
reason clear to us? -=» yes,
Conclusion? Not very pleasant
to look forward to, but definitely
not impossible. If we never fight
unless we're absolutely sure of --

CAPT, RENOUART
Now you're putting words in my
mouth, And furthermore you're
reducing it all to an absurdity.
Look, beyond your wonderful
erystal clear logic there's a
thing called common sense, And
that common sense understanding
of the situation says in big bold
letters, impossible, senseless,
willful murder.

COL. DAX
How do you mean, impossible?
Like @ dead man walking = a.
guy with a bullet through his
heart? Something like that?

CAPT, RENOUART
(wariiy)
Yes.

COL, DAX
I knew @ mn to do exactly that,
He had a hole in his ticker you
couldn't cork with a corncob, but
he walked almost three miles,
I proved that he did and estab-
lished that his wife couldn't have
been near the place he was shot,
You see the trouble with common
sense is that things are often not
what they seem to be.

CAPTAIN RENOUART shrugs and walks along silently. DAX
regards RENOUART, uncomfortably.

Look, Edward, I've seen too many
guys like you not to know the
type. You're a brooder. You
carry the whole world around on
your shoulders. You'd feel per-
sonally responsible if it started
raining. Figure that you might
have stopped it in some way, or
that you ought to have had um-
brellas for all of us, Well, you
better snap out of it as of right
now, Act like a min, Live up to
those captains' bars you're wear-
ing. You do it, or I'll take 'em
off of you. I'll nail your tail
to a stump and push you off back-
wards.

CAPTAIN RENOUART smiles, ruefully.

IN THE COLUMN - MEYER AND FEROL

The only similarity between the two men is their rank of

private. MEYER is a ta

11 bushy-haired man with bizaare ,

uneven features who, by some, might be considered ugly.
FEROL is a slender, somewhat good-looking, if ferret-

faced, young man of about the same age as his friend -
late twenties. They appear to be worried and depressed
in spirit and trying, with som Success, to joke their

way into a better mood,

ANOTHER PART OF THE COLUMN ~ ARNAUD AND DUVAL

We hear the laughter of the previous scene in the dis=
tance, ARNAUD is a tall, wiry min with steel-rimmed
glasses. DUVAL is a plump, friendly looking fellow.
From the way they treat each other we gather they are
very good friends. The two men talk quietly but the
soldiers on each side of them cannot help overhearing
the conversation, with the result that they wear a
studied look of inattention.

PVT, ARNAUD

PvT. ARNAUD

PVT, DUVAL
That's not entirely true though.
They say it's fifty-fifty on each
flip no matter how many times it
comes up head or tail. If you
flipped a hundred heads in & row
the odds of getting a head on the
hundred and first flip would still
be fifty-fifty.

Pvt, ARNAUD
That my be true, theoretically
but if I saw someone flip even

INT, Lf, ROGET'S DUGOUT -~ NIGHT 10

LIEUTENANT ROGET, who we have. seen briefly on the march
into the trenches, 1s a balding, puffy man sporting a
thin mustache. He is in his middle thirties and he has
the kind of face you take an immediate dislike to with-
out even pausing for a moment's reflection that first
impressions are not always correct,

He sits before a battered wooden table, The dugout is
literally dug out of the earth itself, reinforced by
rough-hewn wooden beams and logs. A crude bed of straw
packed into a wooden mold is the only sign of comfort.

LIEUTENANT ROGET is drinking, ani from his heavy move-
ments we miy assume he has not just begun. His face is
cork-biscked and he is in full battle dress but for his
helmet which rests on the table beside him. He takes
several swallows from a bottle of cognao which is almost
empty. There is a candle jammed ina bottle. The flame
flickers in a draft. ROGET looks up,

CORPORAL PARIS and PRIVATE LEJEUNE enter, We have seen
them briefly on the march, too, PARIS is a good-looking,
Well-bullt man, LEJEUNE is a chunky, S80lid-looking man,
They are in battle dress and have their faces blacked,
They snap to attention before LIEUTENANT ROGET, He re-
gards them stonily and mikes a visible effort to pull
himself together, He succeeds to the extent of being
able to reproduce a ponderous air of solemnity.

With ROGET in the lead, they stealthily crawl over the
parapet, The clouds have broken and now the moon is
full, The broken contours of the round stand out in
grotesque relief, Bending low, they swiftly enter the
opening in the wire, All three carry revolvers and extra
grenades. They crawl painstakingly through the lane.
Suddenly their path is blocked by more wire, The night

and LEJUENE follow, The silence is broken by a distant
brief exchange of small arms fire. ROGET increases his
speed, increasing the noise of the patrol, In the almost
perfect silence of the night, the noise they are making
is terrific. PARIS grabs ROGET by the ankle and crawls
up alongside him.

GENERAL ROUSSEAU and his ADC, MAJOR SAINT-AUBAN stride
into view around a traverse, Moving at a smart clip,
they pass troops who stare sheepishly at ROUSSEAU, He
appears to be well liked by the men and returns cordial
nods to many of them. Now and then he stops for a brief
exchange of words = very much enjoying the admiring

ing, gentlemen, Do you suppose

of battle and our own mistakes.

where they were killed, and in what
numbers <=

The place is actually one of those magnificent medieval

over to the Army to use for its own purposes by the
owners who evacuated 1t as the high-tide of war washed
closer,

The parade ground is & huge grassy area about the size
of a football field, It is surrounded on three sides
by white-birch trees, The fourth side opens on the
castle and is connected by a wide gravel road, lined
with flower beds and further back, stately pine trees.

The 18lst Regiment 1s drawn up in a three sided square
Sround the perimeter of the parade ground, The regi-
mental color-stand flutters smartly. The regimental
band is grouped off to one side, Officers stand in
small formations ahead of their troops, COLONEL DAX
stands with CAPTAIN HERBILLION and CAPIAIN RENOUART,

There is & long roll on the field drum, SERGEANT-MAJOR
BOULANGER steps smartly out to the center of the field,
He stops in front of a knot of officers which comprise
ROUSSEAU'S staff, They are grouped in the center of the

The look in RENOUART'S eyes implies, all explanations aside,

that DAX 1s ina large measure responsible for all of this.

It's too good for such dirty work

Also, with General Rousseau so

Rousseau and me, or, I should say,
the General Staff. Any questions

kept within those brackets.

GEN. ROUSSEAU

Colonel Dax, you have made certain
statements and insinuations about
the offices of the General Staff
which paints an extremely ugly
picture, Do you really have that
mental picture of the men who guide
our armies == who hold the destiny
of France, her welfare and her honor,
in their hands? Do you actually
see them as blockheads and blunderers,
petty little men who would willfully
throw away the lives of our soldiers

The beauty of this mess is ite
freedom from complication, All
the men are equally innocent.
None of them showed cowardice, but
one of them's got to be shot for it
nonetheless, low the point is which
one?

Sat. PATIN
I don't see how that's so beautiful.
Do you call that justice?

CAPT. SANCY
Who said anything about justice?
There's no such thing, But in-
justice is as much a part of life
as the weather, Anyway, the lucky
fellow will be making his oontribu-
tion to Winning the war,

SqT, PATIN
In other words, you think the man
who is shot is as much & part of the
scheme of things as the officer who
calculates the barrage, the infantry-
man who goes over the top, or the
quartermaster who doesn't,

CAPT. SANY
Certainly, discipline is the first
requisite of the army. It must be
maintained, and one of the ways to
do it is to shoot a man now am then,
just to show the others how scart
they are to be on the right side.
He dies, therefore, for the ultimte
benefit of his comrades and his

country.
SGT. PATIN
Have you anyone in mind,

Ferol. They are lucky to have this
opportunity,

They also happen to be among the
best soldiers in the company.
As a matter of record, they got
farther in the attack than anyone
in the regiment.

CAPT, SANCY
Which adds one more proof of their
stupidity. Try to get this straight.
If the whole regiment had been made
up of Meyers and Ferols, would it
have done any better? No, Shells
kill good soldiers just as fast as
bad ones, in fact, even faster,
We're all cannon fodder,

elected.

a Jew,

CAPT, SANCY

That's where you're wrong, You're
being shortsighted, This is one
time when being a Jew is going to
save a man's life instead of costing

him it.

self to the same thing over again.

SGT. PATIN
But this isn't going to be a
Dreyfus case.

CAPT .“SANCY
No one thought the Dreyfus case was
going to be one either, They never
dreamed when they picked on that
quiet little Jewish officer that the
whole world would ring with his name
for years to follow. That ministry
after ministry would fall and a war
loom possible because of him, Or
that the entire nation of France
would be kept in a state of distur-
bance over him and his fate, No, if
I chose Meyer the ory of anti-
semitiam would undoubtedly be raised,
rightfully so, too, No one oan say
when or at whose expense that cry
would be silenced, That's where I'm
using my head, I want to be clean,

PROSECUTING ATTORNEY
«oe8nd 80, gentlemen of the court,
I say it has been proven beyond
any shadow of a doubt that the
accused are guilty of cowardice in
the face of the enemy. I shall
therefore confine myself to re-
questing the court act in accordance
with the provisions of the Code Of
Military Justice, to find the accused
guilty of the charges as stated, and
to impose the penalty which 1s pre-
scribed by the code. Thank you,

GEN, ROUSSEAU
Is the defense ready to make its
summary to the court?

COL. DAX

(mounting anger)
Honored judges of the court, it ia
impossible for me to summrize the
ease for the defense, since the court
has not allowed me a reasonable oppor-
tunity to present my case in & manner
which would mike it forceful and under-
standable. I have been prevented from
introducing evidence that I consider
vital to the defense. I have been denied
the privilege of cross-examination,
The prosecution has presented no wit-
nesses. Furthermore, there has been no
written indictment of charges against
the defendants, and the defense has
never had an opportunity to study the
@lleged charges prior to the trial.
Lastly I protest against the fact that
no stenographic notes of the trial
have been kept. It is my absolute
conviction that the aforesaid con-
stitutes a gross violation of legal
procedure which in itself renders this
court martial null and void.

Sergeant Gonoud, you are appointed
to commnd the prisoners! escort
from the guard-house to the execu-
tion posts. You will have a guard
of twelve men under arms, rifles
loaded, bayonets fixed, four men to
each prisoner. The four men are to
be individually assigned to each
prisoner amd held responsible for
that one prisoner alone in case
trouble starts, At any Sign of
trouble the prisoners are to be in-
stantly covered, If the trouble does
not subside at once, the prisoner is
to be shot on the spot, If any con-
certed action gets under way, they
&re all to be shot or bayoneted. But
every effort must be mide to get then
under control without resorting to
shooting. Is that clear?

Sar. GONOUD
Will the prisoners be bound?

S@T. BOULANGER

No, the prisoner's hands will not be
bound until they are at the execution
posts. There i8 no wish to have any
unnecessary cruelty inflicted on them.
The escort is not to exchange a single
word with the prisoners except words
of command, You will be given a litre
of cognac with which to f111 your can-
teen, When you go to fetch the
prisoners you are to give each one
of them & good swig of it and a ciga-
vette if he wants 1t. But see that
they don't take too much. Don't for-
get that it will be on an empty
stomach - a very empty stomach, if my
guess is any good. Then, when the
detachment reaches the corner of the
wood where it turns onto the parade
ground, you are to give them each
&nother swig. That will be their
last. Is that clear? As soon as this

INT, GUARD HOUSE - NIGHT - PARIS, ARNAUD AND FEROL 39

The men have just been served a magnificent meal, Roast
beef, potatoes augratin, assorted vegetables, seeded
rolls, wine, and a tray of pastries. It has been placed
on a fine, white linen, tablecloth which now adorns the
rough table. There are but two things lacking - chairs
and silverware.

Two armed guards wait at the iron door for the K.P, who
served the meal.

The condemned men hover about the table distractedly.

They seem to breathe in short gasps, They have a strange
brilliance about the eyes, a kind of glazed, feverish
quality. Their movements are jerky and often seem to start
without purpose, then, once abandoned, the purpose is
remembered.

The men stare blankly at the food, FEROL picks at the
potatoes with his fingers, Little by little they.all
begin to gather up food in a variety of grotesque ways =
peeling strips of meat off, scooping up pastries, etc.
Gradually the scene begins to resemble what might occur
if savages went to a buffet luncheon, .They eat with a
frenzy. Stuffing food into their mouths as quickly as
they aan. Suddenly PARIS bolts away from the table into
the corner and wretches violently.

This seems to interfere with the pleasure of the others,
and they slowly chew to a halt breathing hard as if to
prevent a similar fate from overtaking their dinner.

Well, you insist on being so fair-

much in what you've said,

COL. DAX
Since this conversation is in private
and most certainly off the record,
my I say, sir, that I quite clearly
see the Army's grievance, The issue
is cloudy and because of that I was
quite able to mke it even cloudier.
But I must in all honesty agree there
is a legitimte grievance on the Army's
part. It is an indisputable fact that
some men of the lead battalion never
left the trenches, I went forward ny-
Self under fire and found them huddled
together like frightened children.
Granted the fire was withering and many
of them would have been killed, never-~
theless, they were in the trenches
when they should have been moving for=
ward. I doubt if their presence in the
assault would have vitally effected
the result, but in all truth, who knows?
-- perhaps it would have, :

GEN ,BROULARD ®

(nodding)
No one can ever know. On the other
hand, I mast admt it is perfectly
obvious from the testimony and the
casualties that, on the whole, the
effort of the troops was very good,
But we've got the problem of keeping
the effectiveness of the troops very
good, What about the men who did go

over the top <= who got as far as
the enemy wire -- who saw their
friends fall all around them?

What would they think if we let the
shirkers get away with it?

COL. DAX

I believe you're sincere in what
you say. I also agree that there
is a great deal of merit in your
position, But my I respectfully
ask, in the confidence of this
library, isn't there yet another
reason &t play in your decision to
Allow those men to die as examples?

GEN. BROULARD
I can't lie to you, Dax, you mow
very well there is. But damning
as it my sound, it is a secondary
consideration, It is, in Pact, you
might say, making the most of a tragic
situation. Of course the General
Staff would like to shift the burden
of failure off its own shoulders.
Why not? We're subject to all kinds
of unfair pressure from ambitious
civilians and politicians. We think
we're doing a good job -- helping
France. Why should we bear any more
eriticism than we have to?

COL, DAX
In other words, you feel that as long
as the men are to some extent guilty
of cowardice, and as long as it is
truly necessary to set an example for
the good of the others, you feel that
is a kiwof lucky convenience for the
General Staff that it can also dump
fhe responsibility of failure onto
she men,

GEN, BROULARD
That's close to it. It's no worse
than when the police find some hood-
lum shot dead in the street, they
claim him to be the cause of one or
two of their long outstanding unsolved

crimes, We can't undo the attack.
We undertook it with sincere faith
in its possibilities. It wasn't in
the oards, that's all,

COL. DAX
General, I am really quite sym-
pathetic to your point of view --
although I suppose it would be
truer to say I understand your
point of view. It finally comes
down to a clear moral issue that
@pplies both to the execution of
the men a8 an example, and to the
Shifting of blame onto innocent
shoulders, You fcel that dis-e
honest as it may be to blame the
men for the staff's failure, it none-
theless serves a higher purpose. It
helps preserve the staff which is
doing good for France. It protects
the staff from its critics who are
perhaps more interested in personal
ambition than in the good the
country, I suspect you my also feel
it is rather inhuman to select men
at random from the battalion and have
them executed as an example, but
this top, will perhaps save other
lives in the future by welding the men
of the Army into a more efficient
fighting force.

GEN ,BROULARD
Very well put, Dax, though somehow
I take it you don't approve.

COL, DAX
There are people who might argue that
good cannot come from evil. That the
ends cannot be used to justify the
means, That if it were possible to do

blinded by your reasons, Certainly
there is something to be gained by
killing those men, From a practical
Btandpoint, perhaps much more than
by saving them, In the end it comes
down to a very simple realization.
Executing those men is a brutal and
inburain thing. I don't have to carry
my moral searchings any further than
that. And I intend to stop it -- or
ZI should say, to have you stop it.

it seems, General, that a certain
Captain came to see me this after-

GEN, BROULARD
The name seems familiar,

COL, DAX
I believe you met him briefly after
the inquiry this afternoon -- some-
thing about some shells falling short?

GEN. BROULARD
Oh, yes, I recall now,

COL, DAX
Would you be surprised to learn that
General Rousseau ordered Captain
Pelletier to fire on the French -
trenches? Yes, into the French
trenches.. During the attack, when
the advance was faltering in the
German wire, General Rousseau ordered
Captain Pelletier to open fire on the
men who hadn't left the trenches --
the so-called mutineers, Captain
Pelletier refused to do this without
&@ written order, General Rousseau took
the phone himself and ordered Captain
Pelletier, in front of the telephone
clerk and Captain Nichols, the
artillery spotter, to fire into our
own trenches, AgAin Captain Pelletier
refused without a written order, Again
he was ordered and again he refused,
&ll in front of witnesses,

GEN, BROULARD
Colonel, you are aware, I should hope,
that General Rousseau has placed this
Captain Pelletier on report for some
poorly registered shota that fell short
on our own men while they were advancing.
Do you really believe this fantastic
story which has obviously been concocted
by Captain Pelletier and his friends to
cover up their own mistakes?

Yes, General, Ido, Furthermore,
I have sworn depositions from all
the principals concerned with this
affair. And most important, I
really don't care at this moment
whether their story is true or not.
It serves my purpose in either
variation. In fact I should act
the same even if I Imew for an
absolute certainty that their
stories were entirely false,

GEN, BROULARD

clearly that this mtter of the

COL, DAX

And I'm not a newspaper pan or a

this situation of a French General
ordering his own artillery to fire on
his own French troops, the type of
story that fires the imagination of
the people. That brings forth every

GEN, BROULARD
And why should anyone believe those
men?
: COL, DAX

For one reason, because they might
want to. It might very nicely serve
their purposes to believe the story.
For another, because the story would
be presented and documented by the
Colonel in commrnd of the regiment,
who was not under arrest, who has not
committed any act of cowardice, who
is a respected member of society, and
last but not in any way least, who is
& friend of many years standing with

as a lawyer in Paris,

VARIOUS ANGLES = PARADE GROUND ~ REGIMENTAL BAND 43

Sixteen men in dress uniforms playing a Spirited march,
The early morning sunlight glitters from their polished
instruments. The musicians appear to be deeply absorbed
in the small square books of music mounted directly in
front of their peff faces. A short, fat SERGEANT
vigorously conducts them.

VARIOUS ANGLES - PARADE GROUND - THE REGIMENT ah

Formed into 4 large, three sided, hollow square, spaced
by Regimental flags that flutter splendidly in a light
breeze -- rifles at parade-rest, eyes front, faces blank
and expressionless. -Mud from the trenches still cakes
their uniforms, Here and there we see a familiar face «=
LIEUTENAND ROGET, CAPTAIN SANCY, LIEUTENANT JONNART (more)
and many of the soldiers we have come to know,

The Regiment's officers are distributed in small groups
in front of the lines of men.

Three black posts, spaced about ten feet apart and backed
by & wooded slope, form the fourth side of the square,

A small detail of men stand near the execution posts.

It is a gloriously beautiful day. The sky is clear and
cloud=swept. The air is full of bird-song, A slight
early morning haze softens the brilliant colors.

GENERAL ROUSSEAU 45

And_a smBQll party consisting of MAJOR SAINT-AUBAN, MAJOR
COUDERC and @ dozen junior officers of his staff, are
grouped apart from the Regiment and closer to the execu-
tion posts, They stand at ease and converse in low tones.
ROUSSEAU carries himself erect and proud, The chest of
his dress tunic is covered with decorations. He gives
the definite impression he has well earned them, He is
the perfect picture of a military ran.

COLONEL DAX 46

Stands not far from GENERAL ROUSSEAU'S group. He is
flanked by his ADC, CAPTAIN HERBILLION and several

resolved to do his military duty.

himself properly, and only someone close-~by might notice
the animil panic in his eyes.

A smmll group of civilians are standing off to one side.
Several wear black coats and tail, top-hats, One of them
bends over @n ancient looking camera, mounted on a huge
tripod, ARNAUD notices this with satisfaction and draws
himself up to his full height. A few moments later, as
the column passes GENERAL ROUSSEAU'S group, ARNAUD turns,
majestically to GENERAL ROUSSEAU,

PVT, ARNAUD
(great disdain)
Assassin] -- watch a hero die,

His guards press in closely but they are not needed. He
turns away, solemnly and continues,

By now, we have gotten appropriate reactions from almost

all the pruned pais in the Regiment: LIEUTENANT ROGET,
COLONEL » CAPTAIN SANCY, PRIVATE MEYER, et al.

OTHER ANGLES = THE EXECUTION POSTS 53

The colum comes to 4 halt. ‘The black posts are spaced
about ten feet apart. Three squads of twelve riflemen
each are placed opposite each pole, They stand at
parade-rest in double rows of six. They are about twenty-
five feet from the pole.

The prisoners are bound to the pole in such 4 way that
their lifeless bodies will still be supported.

PARIS'S stretcher is propped up against the pole, He hangs
forward grotesquely held by ropes, As condemned prisoners
often are, ARNAUD and FEROL are very anxious to do every=
thing correctiy. They willingly place their arms just so.
They both possess the unexplainable cooperativeness of the
condemned, :

The firing squads stand motionless, The PRIEST continues
his spiritual efforts. SERGEANTS GONOUD and BOULANGER
&re everywhere checking and double checking,

VARIOUS ANGLES - INTERCUT 5h

During the above action, at the appropriate moments, we
will cut away to get reactions from certain principals,

FROM THE PRISONERS* VIEWPOINT 55

The following action is all played from the prisoners!
viewpoint. verything is seen in long shot and either
unheard or heard indistinctly.

Fhe drums roll, MAJOR COUDERC solemnly walks to the
center of the parade ground, The regiment seems a solid
wall, He raises a sheet of paper,

MAJOR COUDERC

(slowly
In the name of the French people,
on this day, the fourteenth day
of the month of September in the
year of our Lord, one thousand,
nine hundred and fifteen, the
verdict of the Summry Court
Martial of the Chateau de L'Aigie,
will be fulfilied accordingly»
The soldiers Maurice Ferol, Pierre
Arnaud and Henri Paris, of the one
hundred and eighty-first regiment
of the fourth division, having been
proven guilty of cowardice in the
face of the enemy during the attack
on the enemy line on September twelve
of the year of our Lord, one thousand,
nine hundred and fifteen, are to be
executed by rifle fire in accordance
with the judgment of the Summary Court
Martial.

During the last third of MAJOR COUDERC'S speech, the fol-
lowing action begins. It 1s seen in long-shot and noth:

can be heard of the dialogue, The length of MAJOR 's
speech will be altered accordingly to fit the following
action.

GENERAL BROULARD'S black staff car pulls slowly to a halt
at the edge of the parade ground.

The soldier-chauffeur opens the rear door, The fat Colonel,
DE GUERVILIZ who we have seen before as a member of GENERAL
BROULARD'S staff, exite stiffly, carrying a brief-case,

A t&ll junior officer detaches himself from GENERAL
ROUSSEAU'S group and hurries to the car, The two officers
exchange salutes and converse briefly,

The junior officer salutes again and leads the COLONEL to
GENERAL ROUSSEAU,

They exchange salutes and converse briefly. The COLONEL
produces &n envelope froma brief-case. ROUSSEAU opens
it and reads from & single piece of paper, He lowers the
paper slowly, He s&ys a few words to the COLONEL, The
COLONEL shakes his head, ROUSSEAU glances at the paper
again.

At this moment, MIJOR COUDERC finishes reading the death
sentence, and returns to ROUSSEAU'S group, ROUSSEAU
speaks to several junior officers. One of them salutes
and turns to & non-com,

The non-com salutes and jogs across the field to the
firing squad, He salutes and addresses SERGEANT BOULANGER,
SERGEANT GONOUD joins them, ‘The non-com salutes and walks
away SERGEANT BOULANGER walks to the front of the firing
squad,

SGT, BOULANGER
Squas~ds, right shoulder, haw.

He issues the appropriate commands to march the firing squads
away. The band strikes up & spirited march, Other orders
are shouted indistinctly in the background. The non-coms
begin to march the regiment off the parade grounds,

ANOTHER ANGLE - THE CONDEMNED MEN 56

SERGEANT GONOUD his face split by a grin, runs up to the
prisoners,

SGT. GONOUD
You boys really have a friend some
place, General Broulard's gust
commuted your sentences to thirty
days in the guardhouse, Here, get
these men untied. I drink to your
health,

The guard detail st les with the ropes, They smile
sheepishly. ARNAUD suddenly goes berserk, He grimaces
and begins snorting and drooling, Partially free, he
jerks away from the execution stake, A rope still holds
his ankles. He spills over on his face, He claws at
the ground, The guards gently try to calm hin, At the
Same time, FEROL smiles smugly as he is untied.

Pvt, FEROL
I knew it! I knew 1¢, by God,
I knew it! I knew I wouldn't
die. I knew it!

ANOTHER ANGLE - GENERAL ROUSSEAU 57

He has drifted off by himself, His staff seems to have
wandered off. He stands alone, a beaten figure, In the
background the regiment is being briskly marched off the
Parade ground to the accompaniment of unintelligible
Shouted commands and the brassy strains of a French mrch,
DAX approaches him,

COL, DAX
Good-morning, General,

GEN, ROUSSEAU
(4e211y)
Good-morning, Colonel,

They both stand at a loss for words, ROUSSEAU looks up

Sharply.

GEN. ROUSSEAU
Perhaps you will be interested to
‘mow, Colonel, that in addition to
this magnificent, last minute bit
of grand opera on the part of General
Broulard, I have been relieved of my
command, pending further inquiry.

COL. DAX

(sincerely)
I'm sorry to hear that, sir, I hope
you'll believe me 1f I say that, in
spite of what I thought of your
handling of this...affair, have
always had the greatest professional
respect for you. I meant you no
personal harm,

I believe you, Colonel, There is
nothing like real regret for
brightening a bad conscience.

COL, DAX
(peeved)
I can assure you, sir, there is
nothing whatsoever on my conscience.

GEN, ROUSSEAU
Well, then you must be very proud
of yourself, Colonel,

COL, DAX

I thank God this terrible thing did
not happen, I'll say it again, I'm
not proud of doing injury to you,
Bir. I have always regarded you as
a@ fighting commander, a rarity in
any army, It will be a great loss
to the army if your abilities are
put aside, due to this,

GEN, ROUSSEAU
Is there any doubt in your mind,
Colonel, that I shall receive the
full share of credit for all this?

COL, DAX
If it's any consolation to you, sir,
you must be aware that it is not
Altogether unlikely that I my expect
Some little momento of the Staff's
displeasure, as soon as everything
quiets down,

ROUSSEAU looks around at the regiment marching away. It
is apparent that he was not without a great deal of
devotion for his men, whatever his actions may have been,

GEN, ROUSSEAU
Would you care to walka little way
with me, Colonel.

COL, DAX
qhank you, sir, I'd be very happy

This may sound like sour grapes,
but, ina way, I'm not sorry for
myself, Perhaps, I'm even glad
it's over and done with, Someone
once said, 'The two essential ine
gredients of progress are fire and
unerals,! Perhaps @ man can grow
weary of being the instrument of
that kind of progress,

They wall along in a friendly silence,

GEN, ROUSSEAU
(expansi vely)
Which one of us was on the side of
the angels, I womer,

COL, DAX
I'm not sure I follow you, sir.

GEN, ROUSSEAU
Well, take, for instance, the case
of the early Christians, What was
it, perhaps more than anything else,
that strengthened and solidified
them? -= persecution, wouldn't you
say? . The cruelest kind of injustice.
Tyranny gave birth to the Magna Carta,
Callousness and indifference to human
welfare brought about the French :
Republic. And so on through History.
Tt my be that progress comes really
through & kind of challenge. And who
is to say that if those men had been
shot today, that it wouldn't have
been @ step towards the end of a cer-
tain kind of despotism in the army?

COL. DAX
General, you have a very strange
theory there. I am not at all sure
that I agree with you,

GEN, ROUSSEAU
I'm not at all sure I agree with my-
self. You know, perhaps when they
say mn is a rational aninal, what
they really mean is that he has a
limitless ability to rationalize,

feel self-righteous no mtter what

he does, I don't know why I'm
rambling on like this, Probably be-
cause there's nothing left for me to
do but talk, You know, Colonel, I am
undoubtedly a very wicked man - but

I don't feel wicked inside, Though,
I suppose that's a prerequisite

for being labeled truly wicked,

COL, DAX
labels are fine for tin cans, but
not for people. I dont know,
perhaps every min is as righteous
as the circumstances of his life
allow him to be,

GEN, ROUSSEAU :
That doesn't explain very much,
Colonel,

COL, DAX

Perhaps there are no explanations,
Perhaps we do what we have to,

But, you know, I was just thinking
of & conversation I once had with a
client of mine who was an Atheist.
I asked him how he could possibly
believe that Christianity was a
failure - that it hadn't worked?
Very simple, he said. It was never
tried,

& meditative silence, ROUSSEAU finally looks

GEN. ROUSSEAU.
Colonel, may I ask you to join m
