“STARCROSSED"

ACT ONE
PADE IN:
EXT. CHICAGO STREETS - NIGHT : 1

MARY 4s running for her life, her youthful, exotic.
beauty strained but not quite marred by the fear that's
tensed the muscles in her face, and stiffened the cords
in her neck, and fogged her eyes with the shine of
tears. She glances back.

ANGLE - BUILDINGS 2
Across their street-lit facades flit the ominous shadows
of her pursuers, huge and distorted. And, along with
these shadows, the echoing SOUND of their racing feet.
NEW ANGLE - MARY 3
Breathless, gasping, she intensifies her effort to
outrun them, but it's hopeless. They're stronger than
her, quicker than her.

ANGLE - MEN 4
There are two of them, built strong and tall. Both

wear suits and ties. We're not close enough to see
their faces but, curiously, chillingly, we can hear
their labored breathing and sense not only their
determination, but their anger.

ANGLE - MARY 5
She skids wildly around a corner, almost slips, almost
falls.

ANGLE - MEN 6
Gaining... gaining.

EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD BAR - NIGHT T

Three young men, all in their early twenties, buddies,
come from the bar, laughing, joking with one another,

Two of them are engaged in a little fancy footwork --
shuffle-jab-jab-hook. Mary, running full out, but
looking back again, over her shoulder, collides head-on
with one of them, JOEY, not quite knocking the two of
them to the pavement.

JOEY
(laughing)
Hey, hey, hey! You didn't see
the stop sign, or what?

Shaken, disoriented, still pressed against Joey, his
hands on her arms, Mary looks back. Joey and his
friends look.

LONG SHOT - MEN 8

They run into view from around the corner, then pull up
short as they see Mary with the three young men.

ANGLE - GROUP 9

Joey silently appraises the situation, glances at his
pals, then back at the two men. It doesn't take a
genius to put two and two together. He sort of hands
Mary to one of his friends, like a package for
safekeeping. Then, stepping away from them a few feet,
he repositions himself and eyeballs the two pursuers.

JOEY
(continuing)
So? Something you want here?
ANGLE - MEN 10

Unmoving, mute.

FAVOR JOEY 11

JOEY
(continuing)
Well, come on, come on, you
want it, come and get it!

CLOSER ANGLE - MEN 12

They're twins. Same size, same hair, same eyes, same
restrained, but evident, ferocity.

CLOSER - JOEY AND FRIENDS 13

They can all feel it, like an iron fist held back, or
maybe a claw, and they're hoping like hell that Joey's
bravado, alone, will win the night. There's a pause
that, with the tension, seems quite a bit stronger than
it really is.

ANGLE - MEN 14

They turn away, walk away, and disappear around the
corner.

ANGLE - GROUP 15

A collective sigh of profound relief, quickly disguised
-- as best they can -- by some satisfied laughter.

STEWY
(with a slap on
Joey's back)
Way to go, champ!

And then the other friend, RALPH, raises a megaphone-
shaped hand to his mouth and issues a loud series of
chicken sounds in the general direction of the departed
enemy. Everyone laughs, and even Mary seems to relax a
bit and almost smiles.

FAVOR JOEY 16

He turns to her, really looking at her for the first
time. And now STEWY and Ralph do the same. There's a
bit of discreet glancing between the three pals, as all
of them come to the same and obvious decision: Mary is
gorgeous.

JOEY
You okay?

She nods, smiles again -- just slightly.

MARY
Yes. Thank you.

It was just a few words, but enough to detect an accent;
but not a readily identifiable one. What it does,
though, is make her even more exotic than she already
seems.

Joey glances at the empty street corner, then back at
Mary.

(CONTINUED)

‘ JOEY
@ Close call, huh? Couple of
creeps.
RALPH
Looked like foreigners, if you
ask me.
STEWY
(mockingly serious)

Yeah. You'd never see two guys
in this city act like that.

Ralph slaps Stewy on the head. Stewy laughs.

JOEY
(to Mary)
So... everything's alright now?
I mean, you'll be okay if we
leave you alone?

MARY
(not too
convincingly)
Yes.

Joey and the boys exchange dubious glances.

e JOEY

You live around here?

MARY
I'm... visiting.

JOEY
Oh, yeah? You're not lost,
are you?

MARY

No. I think I can find my way.

Joey nods. A bit of an awkward silence. Then, obviously
reluctant to end it, but not sure how to continue:

JOEY
(to the guys)
What d'tyou think?

Stewy and Ralph exchange a glance.

STEWY ;
What d'we think? We think you'd
be nuts to leave her out here a

JOEY
Right.
STEWY
(to Mary) -

It was a real pleasure...
running into you.

Mary nods, smiles shyly. Stewy taps Joey's shoulder.

STEWY
See you in the morning.

Joey nods. Stewy and Ralph take off across the street
after a final, private grin toward Joey and Mary.

ANGLE - JOEY, MARY 19
A moment of silence between them. :

JOEY
Well, you all set?

She nods. He gestures. They head toward his car, an
early 70's Chevy convertible with the top down. It's
in mint condition. As they approach it:

JOEY
Know anything about cars?

She shakes her head; again the shy grin.

JOEY
Too bad. Been working on it
for two years.
(grins)
It'll just about fly.

Mary looks at the car with new interest as Joey opens
the passenger door for her, then moves around to get in
behind the wheel.

JOEY
So...is this your first time
in Chicago?

EXT. VARIOUS CHICAGO LOCATIONS - NIGHT 20

SUPERIMPOSE MAIN TITLES as the Chevy cruises through
light traffic. We don't hear Joey's conversation but
he looks like a tour-guide. He's proud of his city and
his car. Mary's interest is keen.

EXT. STREET CORNER - WIGHT Bee 21

Joey pulls the Chevy to the curb. ‘He's stopped *
in front of a bus stop. Mary looks at it. It's

7 @ well-lighted area, but a lonely one. There's

a lengthy pause, as if both are undecided about
what they should do next. Then, with some
reluctance, she opens the car door and steps out,
closing it behind her. se leet .

Another pause. She looks back at Joey. He nods,
smiles just slightly, then sort of salutes her with
a little wave. Mary returns the gesture - almost
as if imitating it. eee)

Joey shifts into gear, spins the wheel, swings
a U-turn.

WIDER = SCENE dose 22

Mary approaches the bench and sits neatly. The
Chevy cruises slowly away.

She watches the taillights begin to fade away.

ANGLE - JOEY 24

Driving away, he keeps one eye on her small image in the
rearview mirror. She looks vulnerable as hell. He
steps on the brakes.

CLOSE - MARY 25

For the first time we see a sign of hope in her
expression.

CUT TO:

EXT. ALL-NIGHT DINER - NIGHT 26

There's just a few cars parked beside it. Joey's 1s one
of then.

INT. DINER - NIGHT 27

The only other customers sit at the counter. Joey and -
Mary are opposite one another in a booth, the WAITRESS
standing beside them, waiting with her pencil and

order pad.

JOEY
What're you gonna have?

Mary doesn't respond, seeming uncertain, or maybe even
confused.

JOEY
(continuing; to
Waitress)
I'll have a bowl of chili;
double side of oysterettes.

WAITRESS
Somethin' to drink?

JOEY
Coffee.

WAITRESS
And you, dear?

MARY
The same?

WAITRESS

It's up to you, sweetheart.

Mary seems at a loss again. Joey takes charge.

JOEY
Just make it for two; huh?
Nice and easy.

WAITRESS
(leaving)
Thanks, hon.

There's a silence between them. Joey's not only charmed

by her, he's puzzled. But now, nodding in agreement to
his own statement:

JOEY

I'll tell you what I'm thinking.
I'm thinking you're not just
from another part of the country...
but from a whole different
country,

(taps his ear)
I'm hearing an accent.

Mary lowers her eyes.

JOEY
(continuing)
Give the man a prize.

He repositions himself in his seat, really starting to
enjoy this.

JOEY
(continuing)
Okay... let's see how Sherlock
Holmes would do this...

A pause for serious concentration. Then, using his
fingers for emphasis, as he counts off his major
deductions:

JOEY

(continuing)
One: you're on the run. Two:
like Ralph said, the guys that
were after you looked like
foreigners. Three: you don't
talk a lot, maybe because you're
trying not to give yourself away.
Which means... four: that you've
got something to hide. Which
leads me to... five: that
wherever you're from, you're not
supposed to be here.

A silence. He watches her, searching her expression
for clues.

JOEY
(continuing)
What d'you say? Am I getting
warm?
(he grins)

Maybe even a little "red" around
the cheeks?

Joey glances around, surreptitiously. Then, leaning
forward and lowering his voice:

JOEY
(continuing)
Do I see an Iron Curtain in your
not-so-distant past?

Mary merely stares at hin, looking like she doesn't know
whether to laugh or cry. Joey shrugs.

JOEY
(contdnuing)
Hey, forget it, it's none of
my business, right?

He sits back, picks up his spoon, plays with it. Mary
watches him curiously. Then, terrifically conversational:

JOEY
(continuing)
So, tell me, you married? Got
a@ boyfriend?

Mary shakes her head "no."

JOEY
(continuing)
Me either. I mean, I'm not
merried either. Don't even
have a girlfriend. Can't
afford one.

He politely waits for her to pick up the conversation.
When she doesn't:

JOEY
(continuing)
Any sisters? Brothers?

Mary shakes her head again. It's starting to sound like
an interview, which means it's starting to sound like a
first date.

(CONTINUED)

JOEY
(continuing)
I've got one sister, kid sister,
Goes to college in Wisconsin.
(humbly but proudly)
That's why I'm broke all the
time. I help her out, you know?
(pause; then)
’ How about your folks? Still
living?

MARY
No, I haven't any parents.

JOEY
(nods sympathetically)
Well, you see that? We've got a
couple of things in common.
ne are gone, too. Died when I
was sixteen. Annie was only
twelve, poor little kid.

He seems to momentarily drift off in a melancholy way.
Mary appears to be studying him. The Waitress returns. |

WAITRESS
Here you go, kids: two bowls
of chili, extra oysterettes,
two coffees. Cream and sugar
on the table.

After the momentary racket of plates and cups hitting
the formica, the Waitress leaves and the silence
returns. Then --

JOEY
Go on, dig in, you look hungry.

Mary stares at the chili, once again seeming uncertain.
Joey begins preparing his own, practically drowning it
in oysterettes. Watching him, Mary does it the same
way. Joey grins.

JOEY

(continuing)
No chili in the U.S.S.R., huh?

She doesn't respond. He smiles, then laughs a little --
quite proud of his insightful detection.

JOEY

MARY
Greasy...?

JOEY
Spoon. First time, right? I
mean, having chili.

 

MARY
Yes.

JOEY
Well, what'd you think?

MARY
It was... very good.

JOEY

(smiles)

You don't sound too sure.

MARY
It was different.

JOEY |

I bet. Wasn't even on :

pumpernickel.

He opens the car door for her and she slides in. Then,
just before Joey slides in after her, he catches a
glimpse of a car parked across the street.

ANGLE - CAR 29

It's a big new Mercedes four-door, bullet gray, hulking
and formidable in the darlmess.

PAVOR JOEY 30

He slides in behind the wheel of the Chevy as if he
never saw the car.

JOEY
(continuing)
I've got to ask you something:
Those guys -- did they have
wheels?

MARY
I don't understand.

JOEY
A car,

Sensing the very subtle edge in his voice, she starts
to look around.

JOEY
(continuing) :
Don't turn around.

Rigid, in fear again, she sits motionless, facing front.
Joey starts the engine, acting casual as all get-out.

MARY
They have a gray car.

JOEY
(nods)

Yeah, and expensive taste. -

He pauses a moment to think. She watches him.
JOEY
(continuing)

Tell me something else: are
they packing?

MARY
What?
JOEY
Guns. Are they carrying guns?

I mean, how serious are these

guys?
Mary looks away.

A silence. Then, making a decision

to trust him:
MARY
They're very serious... and very
dangerous.

Joey nods, his worst suspicions confirmed.

JOEY
Okay. One more thing: how
well do they know this city?

MARY
They've only been here for two
days... like me.

JOEY
(mutters under
his breath)

Be thankful for little favors.

Now, with determination he shifts the car into first
gear. He glances at her and smiles briefly, as if to

reassure both of them.

JOEY
(continuing)
Hang on.

He revs the engine, pops the clutch. The tires screech
and spin and smoke. The Chevy roars out of the diner's

parking lot.

ANGLE - MERCEDES

The headlights flash on, the engine fires, and with a
powerful lurch, the big car takes off after them.

EXT. VARIOUS CITY LOCATIONS - NIGHT

It's not somuch a chase as it is a game of follow-the-
leader... through an obstacle course. Joey's a native
and he knows the city inside out and backwards. He

also knows that the Mercedes is twice as quick as his

old Chevy, so the only hope he's got is to run and hide.

Specific locations will be selected which will

ultimately allow Joey -- with his superior knowledge of

the turf -- to escape the pursuers, but not before he
and Mary come perilously close, more than once, to

disaster.

It's a hair-raising sequence that establishes one thing
with extreme clarity: the two men who are after Mary --
for whatever reason -- are determined to succeed; maybe

even if it means their own destruction.

Regardless of

31

32

how many times Joey manages to elude them, they reappear;
the gray Mercedes rising out of the ashes like some

terrible beast: pushing on, coming back, unstoppable.
Through the tinted windows of the car their faces are

obscured, but not their savage tenacity.

In the end Joey and Mary sit in the parked Chevy in some
dark and unseen crevice and, holding their breath, watch

the Mercedes roar past and fade into the night -- this

time, at least, not to return.

Joey turns to her, and she to him. It's too soon to
feel the exhilaration of having somehow, miraculously,
won this battle. Knowing it or not, wilful or not, he
has saved her life two times this-evening. She stares
at him curiously. For some inexplicable reason, she
doesn't understand why he's acted the way he has. But,
as for Joey -- up to this point -- he's merely acted
out of instinct.

Joey breaks the silence for the first time since he and
Mary left the restaurant. It's a masterpiece of quiet
understatement:

JOEY
I think we better have a talk.

Brief pause.
CUT TO:

INT. JOEY'S APARTMENT BUILDING STAIRWAY - NIGHT 33 -

The two of them are trudging toward the top floor, the
fifth floor. Right now they're between the third and
fourth floor landings. The stairway 1s poorly lit and
the building looks like it's probably older than the
hills.

JOEY
I've been climbing these stairs
for eight years. When I first
moved in, the super says to me:
Kid, you're going to have legs
like iron pipe. Then last month
this new guy moves in. I hear
the super tell him: Kid, it's
fantastic for the cardio-
vascular system. Funny how
times change, huh?

INT. FIFTH FLOOR STAIRWAY - NIGHT 34
They're nearing the top.

JOEY
(continuing)

So now I got legs that'll outrun
The Six Million Dollar Man; a
heart like a rocket pump; and a
pair of lungs that could blow up
a blimp.

JOEY (cont'd)
But you know what? I'd give it
all up for an extra hundred
bucks a week and an apartment
in a building with an elevator.

CUT. TO:

INT. JOEY'S APARTMENT ~ NIGHT

The door opens. and Joey steps in, standing aside for
Mary to enter -- which she does, with great curiosity.
Joey comes in, flips on a light, closes the door.

FAVOR MARY

She merely stands there, trying to take as much of it
in as she can. He watches her in silence.

JOEY
May not be much, but it's home
to me.

As Mary continues to survey the Anterior, Joey walks
into the kitchen. The apartment is three rooms; living
room/bedroom, kitchen, and bath. The furniture is in
okay condition, even though it hasn't been changed since
the 50's. The apartment looks pretty clean, actually
homey in a way. There are a few posters on the walls,
carefully picked. One's a nice picture of Marilyn
Monroe -- just her sad smiling face. Another one's a
Photo of some wild horses galloping through a stream.
In a corner 1s a baseball bat, glove and ball; and
beside that, a bowling ball in its bag. Mary pauses in
front of a couple of framed photographs.

JOEY
(continuing; at
the fridge)
My folks, back in '74, And
that's Annie. Beautiful,
isn't she?
MARY

Yes, very beautiful.

JOEY
How about a beer? I know
they've got beer where you
come from. 7

Joey pulls two cans from the fridge, pops the tabs, and
walks back into the main room, handing her one.

JOEY

How d'you say it? Skol? Nyet?

She doesn't respond. He gives up, taps their cans
together.

JOEY -
(continuing)
Cheers.

He takes a slug, slumps down onto the couch, seeming
weary for the first time. She watches him, once again
following his lead, sits down on a chair opposite.

NEW ANGLE - TWO SHOT 37
They silently appraise one another.

JOEY

(continuing)
How about we start with names.
But let's keep it simple, okay?
First names only.

(pause; pointing

to himself)
Me Joey.

(points to her)
You...?

MARY
(after a beat)
Mary.

Joey stares at her, not believing it for a minute.

JOEY
Mary? That's a Russian name
now? Like in Jesus and Mary?

Mary smiles shyly. Joey takes another sip of his beer,
never taking his eyes off her.

JOEY
(continuing)
You don't have the slightest
idea of what I'm talking about,
do you?

( CONTINUED)
e-

18.
CONTINUED: 37

A silence. He leans forward, as if to see her more
closely.

JOEY

(continuing)
Look, I don't want to poke my
nose in where it doesn't belong.
But the way I see 1t, you've
got a problem. And because we
sort of... got together... I
feel a little responsible, and
I figure I ought to try and do |
something to help you out. '

Mary continues to listen intently, but to say nothing.
On occasion -- usually after he does -- she takes a sip
of her beer.

JOEY
(continuing)

But you've got to give a little,
you know? You've got to tell me 7
what's going on. Just so I'm
not groping around in the dark,
running into walls and things,
stubbing my toes.

He's remarkably earnest, and Mary would have to be from
another planet not to sense at least some of that. She
stands, walks across the room to one of the windows
facing the street. She pulls the curtain aside and
looks out. He watches her, his eyes squinting a bit,
his brow furrowed, as his brain continues to be severely
taxed by her mystery. She turns back to face him.

MARY
Those men...

JOEY
Yeah?

MARY

They want to capture me.
(pause; then)
Or kill me.

JOEY
(the reality is
hard to accept)
Kill you? Just because you
Jumped the wall?

Her question wasn't unexpected. His eyes appear to

be any prouder to voice them.

JOEY
That's because where you've come
from, freedom's not a tune you
whistle. But believe me when I
tell you: once you learn that
tune... nobody, not anybody...
can take it away from you.

A beat, and then he extends his hand. She's hesitant to
respond, but then she does. He takes her hand in his
and shakes it. A pause.

EXT. JOEY'S BUILDING - NIGHT

No cars move on the street, and only a few lights glow
from behind curtained windows.

INT. JOEY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Joey's asleep on the couch beneath a blanket. The
covers have been pulled back on the bed, but Mary's
not in it. Instead, she stands, still dressed, by the
window, staring out.

She sits down in front of the small black and white
television, curling her legs under her. She stares at
the set for a second or two. It switches on, by itself.
She settles back to watch an old western. She doesn't
bother to turn up the volume. She watches in silenee.

Joey pushes the blanket aside and rises from the couch
in his boxer shorts and T-shirt. He walks into the

kitchen, Mary trailing behind him, appearing a little
anxious.

NEW ANGLE - TWO SHOT : 52

Joey follows his nose to the stove. There's a pot of
coffee brewing, and a pot on the stove, covered, He
glances at her, quizzically.

MARY
I found things in there and
there.

She points to a cupboard and the refrigerator.

MARY
(continuing)
Was that alright?

Joey looks back at the covered pot, then reaches out --
a bit tenuously -- and raises the lid.

For breakfast?

Her hopeful expression begins to fall.

JOEY
(continuing)
No, no, I love chili! It's my
favorite thing in the world.
I just never thought of having
it first thing in the morning.

He comes from the bathroom, dressed in his mechanic's

without sound, now a particularly silly game show.
Joey leans down and turns up the volume.

JOEY
Better, huh?

She nods, but we're left with the distinct and lingering
impression that she's always been hearing the sound.

JOEY

She may or may not have understood him. He smiles at .
her, clearly reluctant to leave. But then, knowing he
has to, he reaches out, touches her cheek.

The Nazis Jog in unison, one step at a time -- clearly
not as quick as Joey, but just as clearly unphased by
the effort. There's something almost robot-like in
their perfectly even pacing. And in their expressions,
the same frigid coldness we saw last night.

With both of them clinging to the railing, they watch in

watches him. Then, shaking his head, groping for words,
feeling somehow embarrassed and not knowing why:

A silence. Understanding his need, she slowly turns and
begins to look around the billiard’ room. He watches her.
Then, spotting a dozen balls scattered on one of the
tables, she slowly approaches it.

104 INTERCUT - MARY, BALLS, JOEY - 104

She stares down at the numbered balls. Joey watches,
having no idea of what to expect. For a moment, nothing.
But now one of the balls begins to roll, just slowly,
toward one of the pockets. ~

Joey's mouth drops open a bit. A tiny bead of perspira-
tion appears on Mary's forehead. The rolling ball,
still traveling slowly, approaches the pocket, crosses
the lip, drops in.

Joey moves from his position, moving like a man under
water, his eyes never leaving the pool table, as he
comes closer to it.

Another ball has started to roll, this one just a little
faster; and this one, too, drops into a pocket.

Joey stares at her. More perspiration has appeared on
her face, but she seems impossibly calm. Then, a SOUND.
Joey looks back down. Two balis now, and then three,
begin to roll toward different pockets. And then, even
before all of them have sunk, others start rolling.

Joey's eyes dance around the table, watching first this
ball, then that one, then another, then still another,
until -- finally -- all are in motion, and all are gone,
and the table is bare.

105 CLOSE - MARY 105
She turns to him, her face shimmering with perspiration.

106 FAVOR JOEY 106

He turns to her... almost, but not quite entirely, ready
to believe. She senses his hesitation, his turmoil,
his innocence battling with whatever has jaded him, has
jaded nearly all of us. And she knows that what she's
said and what she's done still isn't enough.

122A INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - DAY 122A

~—

Joey and Mary are in the place, Joey engaged in 7
conversation with thé chinese waiter, Mary watching,

@ fascinated by the new language. The waiter Speaks no English.

Joey speaks no Chinese. The problem is that Joey is

attempting to order a particular dish,, only he can't

remember what it's called. All he can do is try to

describe it - in increasingly more elaborate detail.

But since the waiter doesn't understand English, the

-situation seems hopeless.

Joey's frustration intensifies. He begins using his hands
in his attempts to communicate visually. It's beginning
to look like a game of charades.

The waiter continues to rattle off the names of every
single chinese dish he can think of. But not one of them
rings Joey's bell.

But now, after listening carefully, Mary has caught on

to the basics of the Chinese vocabulary. She turns to

' Joey and speaks for the first time in this scene. What 7
| she says, very clearly and very precisely, is the name of
the mystery dish.

“The waiter looks at her. Joey looks at her. Theré's a
brief, stunning silence, and then both men practically
explode in enthusiastic affirmation. With immense
relief the waiter walks back to the kitchen to Place
the order. Joey stares at Mary, once again awed by
her.

 

JOEY
I don't get it. How did you
' do that? I couldn't think of
it. He didn't know what I was
talking about. But you figured

it out. ;
MARY
' You were thinking about it,
! Joey.

A pause. In a way he understands what she means, but he's
: not quite ready to accept it. He shakes it off, wants

He demonstartes, using his chopsticks to pick up an
imaginary bite of food and place it into his‘mouth.

A dubious hesitation, and now Mary does the same. He
watches her carefully, silently encouraging her. Then,

JOEY
Crazy, huh? :

MARY
I like it.

He grins, shakes his head.

Another silence. Then,

JOEY
What am I going to do with you?

She stares at him curiously.

me where you live... where you
came from.

She shakes her head. Another pause,’ and now a thought .
begins brewing in Joey's head.

The large, domed-ceilinged room is empty and dim. In

He's at a loss to know what to do, which switch to pull.
Knowing he's got to start somewhere, he reaches out —-
tentatively -- toward one likely-looking switch.

FAVOR MARY

She stops his hand, shakes her head. He stares at her.
She looks down at the panel, obviously trying to
familiarize herself with it, to understand it. And now,
slowly, she goes to work.

the lights in the room, causes a pattern of stars to
appear on the black ceiling. She changes the pattern

the ceiling is minutely detailed and would seem to
include every celestial body in the universe, and all
of their magnitudes, motions, and constitutions.

FAVOR MARY

She stares intensely at this latest map of the universe,
then finds the control that directs the lighted arrow
along the ceiling. She wants to be as precise as
possible. She takes her time, checking, rechecking.
And then, with great precision, she stops the arrow at
one particular point.

FAVOR JOEY

He stares at the lighted arrow, knowing what it
represents, trying, somehow, to absorb the wonder of it
all, the staggering implications.

Professor Hobbs? It's me...
Joey Donizetti. Remember me?
I'm the guy who always works

She recognizes him, but still seems very uncertain.

PROFESSOR HOBBS
What are you doing in here, Joey?

Joey seems to be at a momentary loss. How can he

possibly explain it?

FAVOR MARY 134
She's made a decision. She reaches for something in her
pocket. Joey's anxious, unsure, maybe even afraid of

what she might pull out.

CLOSE - MARY'S HAND 135
She withdraws something from her pocket that's at first
unrecognizable. It's a piece of flat metal, maybe

copper, maybe gold. The edges are uneven, as if it's

part of something larger that's been broken off.

Mary hands the piece of shiny metal to the Professor,
who takes 1t and holds 1t and stares down at it as if it

were a piece of the original Ten Commandments presented
to Moses.

CUT TO:

INT. COMPUTER LAB ~ DAY .

Joey stands alone in the quiet on one side of a glass
wall. On the opposite side are Mary and Professor
Hobbs. Within the room are a number of computers of
various size and description. Colored lights glow.
Joey can't hear what's being said on the other side of
the glass, but the essence of the scene is apparent.
Copying an amazingly complex mathematical question from
a small sheet of paper she holds, the Professor 1s
writing it onto a blackboard. There appear to be more
symbols than numbers. Even the majority of us, who
will have no idea of what it is that she's writing, will
understand that to comprehend such a question takes a
real measure of brilliance. Mary merely watches,
quietly watches.

Finally finished, the Professor hands the stick of
chalk to Mary, gives her some brief, last-minute
instructions, then checks the time on her watch as she
walks away, heading toward one of the computers.

Joey stares at Mary, staring at the mass of symbols and
numbers on the blackboard. The Professor sits down at
a@ computer, the small sheet of paper beside her, ready
to enter the same question. She raises her hands to
begin typing, but suddenly stops. A SOUND has
distracted her. She looks up. Joey looks.

Mary is writing the answer to the question, writing
steadily, in large and clear numbers and symbols on the
blackboard. Professor Hobbs stares in speechless awe.
Joey begins to grin. Mary continues to write. The
Professor slowly stands. Joey's grin widens. Mary
draws a line under her work, puts the chalk in the rack,
turns toward the Professor -- without even the smallest
trace of superiority in her expression. The Professor,
staggered by this display of genius, feels suddenly weak
in the kmees and slumps back onto her chair. Mary turns
to look through the glass wall at Joey. He raises a
thumb. :

side by side fifty feet away. Directly between them,
lying on the hall floor, is an unabridged dictionary
that looks like it weighs twenty pounds.

INTERCUT - MARY, JOEY AND PROFESSOR, DICTIONARY 150

The anticipation is extreme. Joey and the Professor
stand and stare, their eyes darting between Mary and
the dictionary. Mary's face is bathed in perspiration.
Joey seems to be trying to help her, his jaw twitching,
his muscles tensed. For a moment it looks hopeless.

The Professor sits behind her desk. Joey and Mary sit
opposite, All around the room are the signs and symbols
of the Professor's world: heavenly globes, lush
photographs of celestial bodies, a kinetic sculpture of
the solar system. The atmosphere is scholarly; the mood
portentous.

By the Professor's attitude, it's apparent that even
with all she's seen, and even though she wants to accept
it fully, the pragmatic side of her won't quite allow
total commitment.

Professor Hobbs screams in terror as she starts to rise,
hysterical, having no idea of what she's doing.

third explosion rocks the barn, blowing out another
massive piece of wall. Chunks of flaming wood rain down
around them, as they huddle beneath the lip of the
crater.

A momentary silence. He raises his head above the
crater's edge and peers through the darkness.

She rises, tentatively, and peers over the lip of the
crater to the car. Joey watches her. Her face doesn't
betray the effort, but the perspiration immediately
begins to form on her face, and mixes with the soot and
grime, and starts to streak.

Joey looks anxiously toward the car. Nothing's

EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT 199A
Professor Hobbs' car appears from around a corner, drives
toward camera, pulls to the curb and stops. Traffic
continues by on the drivers side. Beyond the passenger
side of the car is an outdoor skating rink, surrounded

by shimmering lights.

INT. CAR - NIGHT. 199B

Joey and Mary sit in silence. Both are dirty, exhausted,
emotionally drained. Joey turns to her. He's at a loss to
know what to say, but he knows that he has to address
the issue.

JOEY :
I can't say I know how you feel,
because I don't. But if it's 7
anything even close to what I'm
feeling, then we've got to talk
about it. Okay? Will you talk
to me, Mary? :

A pause. Then,

MARY

Professor Hobbs is dead because
of me.
JOEY
No!

If I hadn't come here ... if I
hadn't met you eee

JOEY
{cuts her off)
Wait a minute! Why don't we go
back ‘a-ways. How about if I hadn't
been born ... or the world didn't
exist ...

MARY

politely closes the door -- with profound relief. He
takes a beat to compese himself, then crosses to the
door and opens it.

Didn't it ever occur to you that
something might be different?

A thoughtful pause all around. Then, shaking his head:

JOEY
Forget that.

He sips his beer, trying to do as he preached, but it's
not easy. He's got to admit, even if it's only to
himself, that it's a provocative consideration. Then,
lowering his voice:

STEWY
I suppose you realize what we've
got here.

JOEY

STEWY

He makes a wavy-hand gesture that he accompanies with a
slightly musical sound: outer limits.

Stewy exits the room, but even before he can look around,
four plain clothes federal agents are literally on top
of him, pinning his arms, gagging his mouth, arid hauling
him away. One of the agents reaches into Stewey's

jacket pocket, withdraws his car keys, and tosses them
to another man.

Stewy?

Joey pauses, trying to perceive the answer. Then,
brightening:

JOEY
Yeah. He's in there somewhere.

He looks back at Ralph. Ralph looks away, feeling

uneasy.

A silence.

JOEY

She's in there, Ralph. I'll
bet my life on it. They both
are. Sixth floor.

RALPH
Yeah? Well, your life's not
going to be worth two cents,
you try and bust in there.
It'd be easier getting into

Hey! Where're you going?

Joey keeps walking, doesn't even @lance back. His look
of determination is almost ferocious.

JOEY
Going to get her, Ralph. I'm
going to spring her.

He stalls, standing alongside the large office directory,
his tension very apparent as he watches the routine, the
display of passes, the guarded admissions.

NEW ANGLE - JOEY 242

He moves away from the office directory and begins
toward the guards, walking casually, slowly, not really
clear as to what he'll say or try to do. But now, a
sudden break:

ANGLE - SCENE 243°

An alarm BELL goes off, a harsh, clanging sound that
immediately gathers everyone's attention. Then, from
one of the two-way radios the guards wear in holsters
around their waits, a garbled communication.

FAVOR JOEY 2aky

He stops dead in his tracks. Is 1t him? Have they
already spotted him? He looks around, scared half
to death.

ANGLE - GUARDS 245

One of them shouts to the security man at the
information counter:

GUARD
Take it over! Now!

He indicates their station, and now both guards
immediately turn and race off toward the fire stairs,
abandoning their post.

FAVOR JOEY 246

He turns to look toward the security guard. He's an
older man, a slow-moving fellow, who must extricate
himself from behind his counter. It'll take a few
seconds, precious seconds, during which the main post
will be vulnerable.

Joey isn't liking it at all.

SPOKESMAN
A friend.

JOEY

Yeah? Why don't I believe you?

He turns, unlocks the door, tries to open it. It's
securely locked from the hall side. He looks back at
the Spokesman and the dozen other bureaucrats, shielded
behind the glass wall.

SPOKESMAN

(he's never

threatening)
Our colleague, Professor Hobbs,
a distinguished scientist and
a remarkable woman, is dead.
With respect to her memory, and
so that she'll not have died in

cooperation.

Joey turns to Mary, then back to the Spokesman.

(truthfully)
I don't have the slightest idea
of what you're talking about,

He continues to bash at the glass wall, but it doesn't
give an inch. Now, though, the light in the room
beyond the glass begins to fade. The Spokesman and the
dozen others -- watching impassively, clinically --
slowly disappear in darkness. Joey continues to shout
at them, his voice growing hoarse. And then, finally,
he stops -- exhausted, sweating -- and turns to face
Mary.

to the motel and you were gone,
I knew that I'd been waiting

had to see you again. I had to
touch you again.

She searches his eyes.

MARY
Why did you say that? About not
being able to keep me?

Because I know the future, Mary.

She looks down, tears in her eyes again. He holds her
hands even more tightly.

heard you talking to me this

When I came here I was afraid.

you lived your life, and saw how
you were ready to fight and even
die for what you believed in,
and just as ready to fight for
me -- who you barely knew.

courage, Joey. So much dignity.

everything I had if I could only
get far enough away from it.

INT. CAR - NIGHT * 323
Joey stares straight ahead through the windsheild, -
confused, even awed by what he sees.

JOEY
Is that ... the ship?
MARY
(nods)
Yes.

A beat, and then Joey exits the car - Mary does the
same.
NEW ANGLE - FAVOURING JOEY * 324
He stares at the outer space ship. Clearly, it must
be something unlike anything he might have expected.
ANGLE SHIP * 325

Forty yards away, it hovers motionlessly about
eighteen inches off the floor, backlit by moonlight
streaming in through a row of enormous windows.

It's a gloriously simple creation, barely more than
ten feet high and five feet wide, a pair of triangular-
shaped glowing glass tubes connected at the base by a
third tube, this one an oval. It looks like a piece

of kinetic sculpture, shimmering with it's neon-

like gasses in ice-cream colours.

FAVOUR JOEY * 326

He remains in quiet awe of this object.

JOEY
(almost whispered)
I don't understand. You travel
in that? :

MARY
Yes.

JOEY
But it's ... nothing. It's open.
It doesn't have any walls, any
seats, any engines, any controls ...

MARY
No. But we do travel in it ...
like light.

He stares at her, still very unsure.

JOEY
It's one of your ships?

MARY

Yes. Their's are very primitive.
They couldn't have come this far
in one of their own.

(pause; then)
They have very little compared
to us. Which is why they wanted
our world ... and took it.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: * 326

A silence. Joey searches the surrounding darkness.

JOEY
Do you think they're here?
She looks at him. Then, almost as if it's a test:

MARY
Do you?

A beat. He looks around again, this time letting himself
"sense" the area, as well as see it. Then, nodding:

JOEY
Yeah. But I don't think they're
together.

A silence, as they both try to pin down the enemy's
location. Then, taking her by the arms, he gently
turns her toward him.

JOEY
(continuing)
We don't have the time to play
cat and mouse with them. I've
got to smoke them out... draw
7 their fire. |

MARY
No,

JOEY
There's no other way. How long
will it take you to get off the
Ground, once you're inside?

MARY
It's almost immediate.

JOEY
Alright. Then you're going to
have to be ready to make a run
for 1t. Okay?

She doesn't speak. He pulls her against him. She wraps
her arms around hin, fiercely. Then, grinning through
his own tears; .

JOEY
(continuing)
Will you write?

As long as we live, we'll always
be together.

She lifts her face to his and kisses him, and this time

it's as if

they'll never part. But then, when they do:
JOEY

Will you come back? Ever?
MaRY *

How long will you wait for me?

JOEY
As long as there's hope.

MARY
Then hope. Always hope.

They kiss again, even more 4ntensely. And then, in the
most selfless act he's ever made, Joey breaks away from
her and runs.

NEW ANGLE - SCENE ; * 327

He's like a dark streak, racing across the emptiness,
having no idea when -- or even 4f -- an attack will be

launched.

He steps out from the cover of his hiding place.

A direct hit. The Nazi, along with whatever he was
standing near, is pulverized in a flaming, thundering
explosion.
ANGLE - JOEY * 333
He drops back down to the ground.
- JOEY
(shouting)
Now, Mary! Run! Run!
ANGLE - MARY * 334
She races from the safety of her hiding place, running
directly for the ship.
CLOSE - JOEY : 7 335

He scans the area, desperately looking for a clue to the
other Nazi's position.
ANGLE — SHIP * 336

The second Nazi is suddenly there, directly in front of it.

CLOSE - MARY * 337
She stops abruptly, staring in horror.

MARY
Joey!!!

ANGLE - JOEY 7 338

He whirls around, prepared to fire.

NEW ANGLE - SCENE 7 339

The Nazi stands 2fi front of the ship, . Joey's weapon
aimed directly at him.

JOEY

frustrated cry)
I can't shoot! If he goes, so
will the whole ship!

CLOSE - NAZI Poe 340
For an instant, he almost seems to smile. But it's a
chilling expression, more like the rictus grin ofa

corpse. And then he slowly raises his hand, and in it,
another weapon, aimed not at Mary, but Joey.

EXTREME CLOSE-UP - MARY . 341

MARY
Nott!
ANGLE - NA2I * 342

as, doubtlessly for the first time in her life, Mary
uses her power to destroy a living creature, and the
Nazi seems to blow apart from the inside out.

ANGLE - JOEY hal 343
He's momentarily staggered by the sight.

ANGLE - MARY . . 344

She turns her head away.

WIDER ANGLE - SCENE * 345

Joey runs to her, takes her into his arms, holds her.
She looks at the ruin around them.

MARY
(continuing)
Is this the price of freedom?

A beat.

JOEY
Nobody can answer that but you,

(pause; then)
But you better figure it out
before you get home.

She looks up at him, her face shimmering with tears,
then reaches out and touches his cheek as she did once
before -- as he taught her. In the b.g., the distant
THUD of helicopter rotors. She breaks away and runs
to the ship,and steps into it where she, too, seems to
hover eighteen inches above the warehouse floor, surrounded
by the delicate tubes of coloured light.

It's immersed in new light, laser-like beams, radiant,

almost blinding. And now the entire shape begins to
rise off the floor, the light moving with it.

There are tears in his eyes.

The light hovers over the floor, floats gaily, turns,
then suddenly accelerates.

He's terrified.

It speeds toward the massive windows and smashes
directly into them.

He stares up at the light until it's gone from
sight.

In the b.g., the roar and thud of the helicopter.
Joey looks.

It hovers a couple of hundred feet off the ground,
it's searchlight playing down over the warehouses.

at Frankie's car, forty yards away.

A grin begins to turn up the corners of his mouth.

ANGLE - CAR 7 370
The headlights flash on, almost merrily.

ANGLE - JOEY _# 371

He stands there illuminated by the headlights as the
car rolls to a polite stop in front of him.

In the b.g., the thundering roar of the helicopter as

it sets down outside the shattered windows and it's
spinning rotors make the dust inside the structure

swirl around Joey and in front of the headlights,
twinkling and shimmering like a tiny but active universe.

NEW ANGLE - SCENE ; * 372
A massive steel door slides open behind Joey and a

dozen federal agents slowly step into the warehouse,

each man armed with an automatic rifle, all of them
silhouetted by the light behind them.

FAVOUR - Joey * 373
He doesn't even seem to notice them as they slowly

fan out in a wide semi-circle and begin their cautious
approach.

Instead, his gaze is locked on the moon and stars beyond

the shattered window. And - in his mind, at least - A
single pinpoint of light fading into infinity.

FADE OUT
