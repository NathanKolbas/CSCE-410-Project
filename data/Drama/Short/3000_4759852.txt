FADE IN:
EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD. - NIGHT
It is shortly after midnight on an icy night.

An old yellow Mustang pulls alongside the curb on a sleazy
section of Hollywood Boulevard. The passenger door opens and
Vivian steps out. She quickly shuts the door and walks away from
the car as if it wasn't there. The Mustang drives off. Vivian
continues strolling down the street, cold white breath floating
from her bright red lips.

Dressed in a tight purple leather mini-skirt, black stockings
and a white imitation fur jacket, Vivian is twenty- two years
old. She has been hooking or over six years. Heavy make-up
gives her pretty face a dangerous and hard look.

She lights up a cigarette and takes a drag. She moves gracefully
on spiked heels across the grime covered sidewalk. She owns this
section of the boulevard. After six years on the street she has
seen it all. She has done everything and will do anything.
Humiliation is for the shy. Fear is for the innocent.

Occasionally a car passes and Vivian's hawk eyes watch it for
any indication of interest.

She passes a vagrant huddled in a pile of ragged blankets and
newspapers in a doorway. She barely sees him; he is simply part
of the scenery.

Across the street a black prostitute strolls by, rubbing he pst
shoulders against the cold. At an all-night fast food stan
several drug dealers are talking and eating.

Yet, except for the occasional sound of police helicopters in
the distance, the street is quiet. It is not bustling with
activity like a TV cop show. It is empty and lonely and cold.

Vivian's ears and cheeks are red from the chill, but her
cigarette keeps her warm inside. A couple more customers and
she'll earn enough for the night.

She glances across the street at _a bright yellow Winchell's
doughnut shop. Half a dozen peop ple sit at the dirty white tables
Gnside. She sees something that annoys her. She changes course.

Vivian hurries across the street toward the Winchell's. She
pushes the glass door open and goes inside.

INT. WINCHELL'S - NIGHT

Behind the counter we see two older Vietnamese men making
doughnuts, trying to ignore the unsavory crowd camped in the
shop.

As Vivian enters, a gangly, ugly young Drug Addict moves toward
her. His faltering voice and awkward movements indicate that he
is on the last legs of excessive crack use.
DRUG ADDICT
Hi, V-vvivian.

Vivian doesn't even glance at him.

VIVIAN
Hi.

She moves past him toward the back of the shop. Sitting ata
table is Kit, a young, dark-haired prostitute, thin an
unhealthy-looking. She is talking with a black Old Man.

KIT
Vivian.

Vivian looks at her, annoyed.

. VIVIAN
Kit, what are you doing?

KIT
Waiting for you. It's fucking cold
out there.

VIVIAN
It's not going to be any warmer
tomorrow night.

The Old Man waves at Vivian.

OLD MAN
Hi, Viv.
VIVIAN
(quickly, without looking
at him)
Hi.
(to Kit)

Let's get working. We've only got a
couple hours before the street
clears.

KIT
It's too cold. No one's out.

VIVIAN
They're out.

Kit coughs so loudly and deeply that it's obvious she has
emphysema.

KIT
Let's get high.

Vivian grabs Kit by the shoulder and drags her toward the door.

VIVIAN
We're going to work. Come on.
EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD. - NIGHT

Vivian and Kit come out of the shop and onto the street. As they
walk Kit wraps her arms tightly around her body to shield
herself from the cold. She starts to cough again.

Vivian is

KIT
It's too cold. I'm gonna get sick.

VIVIAN
We've got to work. The rent's
coming up. I'm not going to lose
a

our place.
KIT
We'll make it up tomorrow. Let's
get high.
VIVIAN
How much have you made tonight?
KIT
(hesitantly)
Twenty.
angry.
VIVIAN

One fucking date?

KIT
I haven't felt good.

VIVIAN
I'm going to fucking kick you out
if you don't start holding up your
end!

Kit's eyes water and she starts to sniffle.

Kit wipes

VIVIAN
Don't ory on me. I'm not your

your end or I wouldn't have let you
move in.

her eyes.

KIT
Tomorrow's Friday. We'll make it up
then. Don't you want to get high?

VIVIAN
I don't want to spend everything
we've got. The rent's coming.

From Vivian's face we see that she is starting to relent.

VIVIAN
Give me the twenty.
Kit reaches down and pulls out a twenty dollar bill from her
sock. She hands it to Vivian. Vivian stares at her levelly.

VIVIAN
You're not holding out on me?

KIT
It's all I've done. No one's out.

Kit starts to cough again.
VIVIAN
(softening)
Maybe it is too cold.
They walk down the street toward the fast food stand.

KIT
Are we going to get high?

VIVIAN
Just be quiet for awhile.

Kit knows that means yes. She rubs her shoulders and hurries to
keep up with Vivian's long strides.

A car approaches slowly and Vivian pauses to watch it. It passes
without stopping. Vivian continues on.

EXT. FAST FOOD STAND - NIGHT
Vivian and Kit approach a Latino Drug Dealer.

VIVIAN
Where's Carlos?

DRUG DEALER .
What you want, girl? I can fix you
up.

VIVIAN
Where's Carlos?

DRUG DEALER
The cops got him. What you want?

VIVIAN
I only buy from him. When's he
getting out?

DRUG DEALER
How do I know? You think I'ma
lawyer? You want some stuff or not?

He holds up a small baggie containing three rocks.
VIVIAN

I don't want any of that yellow
shit. Don't you have any white?
DRUG DEALER
This is good stuff.

He shakes them from the baggie into his hand.

DRUG DEALER
I'll let you taste it.

He offers it out. Vivian glances around, unsure, looking for
another dealer.

DRUG DEALER
Taste it.

Kit comes up to Vivian's side.

4 RIT
Let's just get it.

The drug dealer offers it to Kit.

DRUG DEALER
Taste it, sugar.

Kit takes a rock and tastes it with her tongue.

KIT
(to Vivian)
Let's get it.

Vivian sighs and pulls out a twenty. Before the dealer can grab
it, she pulls it back.

VIVIAN
Not that one, the big one.

She points at a different rock in the Dealer's hand. The Dealer
rolls his eyes {the rocks all seem the same size to him) and
takes the rock from Kit's hand. He hands Vivian the other rock.
Vivian hands him the twenty.

VIVIAN
When's Carlos getting back?

DRUG DEALER ;
He's across the street, girl.

He points across the street at another drug dealer who has just
come around a corner. Vivian sees him. She flips the Dealer off.

VIVIAN
You fucker! This better be good
stuff.

DRUG DEALER
It's good.

He walks away. Vivian and Kit turn and head back down the
street.
INT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT

Vivian and Kit stand at the counter of a liquor store. A small
Vietnamese Clerk is behind the counter.

VIVIAN
Give me a pipe kit.

The clerk reaches under the counter and pulls out a small baggie
containing a cheap glass pipe and a bit of steel wool.

CLERK
(in broken English)
You want lighter?

Vivian nods and selects a red Bic from the display. She hands
the clerk a five-dollar bill and he hands back the change.
Vivian counts it and then stashes it and the pipe kit away.

VIVIAN
(to Kit)
Come on.

They exit together.
EXT. STREET - NIGHT
Vivian and Kit walk down the street together, heading for home.

VIVIAN
We should bleach your hair.

nnd
(coughing)
I like my hate.

VIVIAN
You'll make more money if we bleach
it. If you're going to stick with
me you're going to have to make
more money.

KIT
(meekly)
Okay.
Vivian puts an arm around Kit's shoulders.
VIVIAN
It'll be pretty. We'll give it a
natural curl or something.
Vivian teases Kit's hair with her fingers.
VIVIAN
You'll like it.

KIT
(more hopefully)
Okay.
Vivian hears a car slowing behind them. She giances over her
shoulder and sees a sleek black Mercedes following them.

VIVIAN
Look at that.

The Mercedes pulls up past them and stops. Vivian and Kit pause.

___ VIVIAN
(grinning)
There's rent.

Kit isn't happy about the delay, but she waits obediently as
Vivian walks up to the car and leans over the passenger window.

The window electrically rolls down and Vivian looks inside.

In the driver's seat is Edward Harris, a good looking, well .
groomed man in his late forties. He is wearing an expensive suit
and tie.

VIVIAN
You want a date?

Edward stares at Vivian coolly, as if still debating. His eyes
jogk at her as if studying a label on a bottle of wine. He makes
a decision.

EDWARD
Yes, hop in.

VIVIAN
How much you want to spend?

Edward smiles, amused for some reason.

EDWARD
What are your rates?

Vivian, influenced by his car and clothes, blurts out a high
figure.

VIVIAN
A hundred.

EDWARD
For the whole night?

VIVIAN
(quickly)
For an hour.

EDWARD
I'm looking for someone for the
whole night.

VIVIAN
For what?
EDWARD
Whatever.

VIVIAN
Five hundred.

EDWARD
That seems high.

VIVIAN
Three hundred.

Edward is enjoying this game.

EDWARD
Two fifty.

Vivian eyes Edward. Two fifty is more than enough, but she can't
help thinking that she could get more from him. She decides not
to push it.

VIVIAN
Where do you want to go?

EDWARD
I've got a hotel room.

VIVIAN
Okay. Wait a second.

Vivian walks over to Kit's side.

VIVIAN
I'm going to go with him.

KIT
How long?

VIVIAN
I don't know. He said the night. Go
on home. Here ...
Vivian hands Kit the baggie with the pipe and the rock.

KIT
Will you be home in the morning?

VIVIAN
I don't know.
KIT
What if I'm hungry?
Vivian pulls out a twenty and hands it to Kit.

VIVIAN
Don't spend it all.

Kit nods.
KIT
Maybe he'll give me a ride?

Vivian turns back toward the Mercedes and bends down
can see Edward through the window.

VIVIAN
Can my friend have a ride home?

Edward shakes his head.

EDWARD
I'm not a taxi.

Vivian turns to Kit.

VIVIAN
Go on.

Kit coughs. She's unhappy about going home alone.

KIT
I'll wait up for you awhile. In
case you get home. We'll get high
together.

Vivian pats Kit affectionately on the shoulder.
VIVIAN

It's okay, babe. You don't have to
wait for me. Just save some.

until she

Vivian gets inside the Mercedes. Kit watches as it drives off.

INT. MERCEDES - NIGHT

Vivian sits comfortably in the warm leather seat. She finds the

ashtray on the dash an
She looks at Edward curiously as he drives.

VIVIAN
Nice car. Yours?

EDWARD
It's rented.

VIVIAN
What's your name?

EDWARD
Edward. What's yours?

VIVIAN
Vivian. What motel are you at?

EDWARD
The Beverly Wilshire.

lights a cigarette with the car lighter.
10.

VIVIAN
That place next to Augie's?

Edward regards her for a moment, amused.

EDWARD
Beverly Hills.

__ VIVIAN
(oblivious )
Nice place?

Edward smiles to himself.

EDWARD
It's alright.
VIVIAN
You from out of town?
EDWARD
New York.
VIVIAN
I've never been to New York. How is
it?
EDWARD
It's alright. How do I get back to
Wilshire?
VIVIAN
Make a left up there. Why are you
in L.A.?
EDWARD
Business.
VIVIAN

What kind of business?
EDWARD
uy, you eSik a ise
Vivian, squelched, takes a drag from her cigarette.

VIVIAN
Just being friendly.

Edward doesn't respond.
EXT. BEVERLY HILLS - NIGHT

The Mercedes glides through the streets of Beverly Hills.
11.

INT. MERCEDES - NIGHT

Edward looks over at Vivian, who is sitting silently next to
him.

EDWARD
My overcoat's in the back seat. Why
don't you put that on?

VIVIAN
Why?

EDWARD
Let's just say you're a little over-
dressed for this ... motel.

VIVIAN
They don't like hookers?

EDWARD
It's not the kind of place that
rents rooms by the hour.

VIVIAN
Every prace has hookers. They just
don' ike to admit it.

EDWARD
Perhaps so. But if this hotel has
any hookers they don't look like
they're ...

VIVIAN
... off the Boulevard?

EDWARD
Exactly.

EXT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Thousands of tiny white lights sparkle along the walls of the
Beverly Wilshire Hotel. Bright flags are illuminated by
carefully placed spotlights.

The Mercedes has stopped in a valet parking lane. A valet opens
the passenger door and Vivian, bundled up in Edward's overcoat,
steps out. Edward hands the keys to another valet.

A doorman opens the huge glass door for Vivian and Edward. They
step inside.

INT. LOBBY OF THE BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL - NIGHT

The lobby is bright and spacious, filled with thick carved wood

paneling and expensive decorations. Even at this hour there is a
great deal of activity; men in business suits and women in furs

and jewels are passing by to their rooms.

Vivian's face tries to conceal the awe that she feels at the
sight of all this luxury.
12.

She covers it well, lifting her chin ae slightly and stiffening
her back as she walks at Edward's side.

Edward is perfectly at home. He places one hand on Vivian's
elbow and guides her through the lobby as gracefully as he
drives his Mercedes.

They reach the elevators and go inside.
INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

The young Elevator Operator is dressed in a clean red uniform
that seems just a bit too tight. As the elevator doors close he
nods toward Edward.

OPERATOR
Floor, sir?

EDWARD
Penthouse.

OPERATOR
Yes, sir.

The tone of the Operator's voice indicates that Edward will not
have to tell him again. He will remember Edward. There is only
one penthouse.

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

Edward and Vivian come out of the elevator into a hallway
jeading | toa Sanda doorway with two heavy wood doors. ward
pulls his key and unlocks the door. With a gentle push the doors
slide open in unison.

Edward gestures to Vivian to go inside. She does. Edward closes
the doors behind her.

INT. PENTHOUSE - NIGHT

As Vivian Bor into the room_she has the sensation of falling
off the top of the building. In front of her is a sunken living
room with massive windows revealing the sparkling lights of the
city below. She is speechless.

Edward is quite at home. He closes the door and walks past Jh her,
down the steps to the living room. The living room is filled
with museum-quality art deco furniture, all rose and gray and
lavender. On one of the walls is a relief of stylized Egyptian
figures. He picks up a phone.

EDWARD
Room service ... I'd like a bottle
of the house champagne and a bowl
of chilled strawberries sent to my
room. Penthouse. Thank you.

Vivian still stands motionless by the front door. Edward looks
up at her, his trademark half smile drifting to his face.
13.

EDWARD
Nice view?

Vivian says nothing. She makes her way down the steps to the
living room, her legs a little weak.

EDWARD
I've impressed you?

Vivian looks at Edward, her awe giving way to a cynical sneer.

VIVIAN
No. I come here all the time. As a
matter of fact, they do rent this
room by the hour.

Edward laughs. He sits down in a comfortable chair and leans
aCK.

EDWARD
Very good.

Vivian paces through the room, still hypnotized by the view, but
recovering quickly.

VIVIAN
I don't get it. What's a guy like
you doing cruising Hollywood
Boulevard?

EDWARD
Why not?

VIVIAN
Hell, you should be able to pick up
a phone and order a girl from Room
Service.
(suspiciously)
Unless you're into some weird stuff...

EDWARD
No, not at all. Just the usual
stuff. I don't have that much
imagination.

Edward loosens his tie.

EDWARD
To be honest, I wasn't planning on
having a girt tonight ab all. I was
sightseeing the Chinese Theater

when I got lost.

VIVIAN
Lost?

EDWARD |
I don't know the city very well and

while I was driving dround I
spotted you.
14.

VIVIAN
And fell in love.

EDWARD
Or a close approximation.

A chime goes off to indicate there's someone at the front door.

EDWARD
That should be the champagne.

He starts to sit up. Vivian motions for him to stay put.

VIVIAN
Eh, sit! I'll get it.

Edward sits back down. Vivian waltzes up the steps and opens the
front door. A Waiter comes into the room with a silver cart. On
it is a bucket of champagne and a covered bowl.

WAITER
Where would you like it?

VIVIAN
Down there, I guess.

The Waiter carries it down the steps and sets it in the middle
of the living room.

EDWARD
That'll be fine.

The Waiter heads back up the stairs and pauses near Vivian.
Vivian stares back at him.

VIVIAN
(annoyed)
What are you looking at?

The Waiter glances away uncomfortably and exits. Vivian closes
the door behind him. Vivian marches back down the stairs.

EDWARD
I think he wanted you to tip him.

VIVIAN
For one bottle?

EDWARD
I quite agree.

Edward stands up and crosses to the silver stand. He lifts the
lid on the bowl to reveal a dozen enormous strawberries. He eats
one. He twirls the champagne bottle in the ice bucket and then
gracefully lifts it out.

VIVIAN
I still don't see why you picked me
up. Don't you have a girlfriend or
a wife, or both?
15.

Edward deftly pops the cork on the bottle without losing a drop
of champagne.

EDWARD
Both. I got the house brand. I
didn't think you'd mind.

VIVIAN
It all tastes the same to me. So
where's your girlfriend and wife?
Sleeping together?

Edward pours the champagne into a long-stemmed glass and hands
it to Vivian.

EDWARD
My wife divorced me and is in
Europe I believe. My girlfriend is
in New York. Cheers.

Edward places the champagne bottle back into the bucket. Vivian
holds the glass awkwardly.

VIVIAN
Aren't you going to have any?

EDWARD
I wish I could. But my liver rotted
away. I can't have any alcohol.

VIVIAN
You don't have to get me drunk,
honey.

Vivian takes a sip from the glass.

EDWARD
No. I just like the smell. Fond
memories.

He eats another strawberry. He glances at Vivian's glass.

EDWARD
How do you like it?

VIVIAN
Not much. I don't really drink. I
smoke though. I don't guess you do?

EDWARD
No. Not tobacco or otherwise.

VIVIAN
It was the otherwise I wanted.

EDWARD
Try a strawberry. It'll bring out
the sweetness of the champagne.
16.

Vivian eats a strawberry and then washes it down with the
champagne.

EDWARD
Better?

VIVIAN
It's okay. Why didn't your
girlfriend come with you?
Edward's face sours.

EDWARD
I don't know. Just being difficult.

Vivian takes another sip and smiles wickedly.

VIVIAN
She wants a new mink.

Edward isn't sure if he finds that funny.

EDWARD
My but we do like to talk.

Vivian shrugs.

VIVIAN
You want me to shut up, I'll shut
up. It's your two fifty.

She takes another sip from her glass.

Edward turns from her and walks to the windows. He looks out
into the city.

Vivian finishes her champagne, goes to his side, and starts to
rub his shoulders. She leans over and kisses his neck.

Edward takes her chin in his hands and studies her face. He runs
a finger over her lips until his fingertip is covered in red
lipstick. He then takes the finger and touches her nose, leaving
a red dot.

EDWARD
Have some more champagne.

He returns to the tray and pours her another glass. Vivian rubs
the lipstick from her nose.

VIVIAN
I don't like it much.

; EDWARD
A bit more. Here.

He places the glass in her hand and tips it up toward her face.
She drinks it.
17.

EDWARD
Nothing puts a sparkle in a woman's
eyes like champagne.

Edward's hand continues to lift the glass until Vivian finishes
it. She takes a breath

VIVIAN
You_ should see my eyes when I've
smoked a piece.

Edward takes the glass from her hand and sets it down.
EDWARD

Five hundred years ago a cocaine-
snorting nation of Indians was

enslaved by a few dozen drunken
Spaniards.

VIVIAN
So?

EDWARD

I think it was McLuhan who said
that alcohol is the drug of
civilized man.

EDWARD
You like to talk, too.

Edward smiles.

EDWARD
Yes. I guess I do.

Vivian glances around the room.

VIVIAN
So where are we going to screw? Or
do you just want to talk?

EDWARD
How about the bedroom? You want any
more champagne?

VIVIAN
No. I don't like to drink too much.
I get numb.

EDWARD

Alright.
He takes her by the hand and leads her toward the bedroom.
INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

Edward turns on a light, revealing that the bedroom has been
decorated in keeping with the art deco theme of the penthouse.
18.

Another large relief, this one of prancing unicorns, is mounted
over the bed. The bed itself is enormous and covered with gray
satin sheets and a rose comforter.

Edward walks over to the bed and picks up a mint lying on the
pillow. He tosses it to Vivian.

Vivian catches it, unwraps it, and pops it into her mouth.

VIVIAN
(munching)
Can I have my money now?
EDWARD
Oh ... yes.

He reaches into his jacket and pulls out a money clip. He takes
five fifties from it and hands them to her. It doesn't appear to
diminish the size of the clip.

Vivian takes the money and stuffs it into her tiny purse.

VIVIAN
Thanks, honey.

She gives him a kiss. Edward returns it. Just as he is about to
pull her into his arms she abruptly steps back from him.

She quickly undoes her clothes. She slips out of her shoes.

VIVIAN
So what would you like? Just a
screw, or you want a blowjob first?

EDWARD
We'll ... play it by ear. See how
it goes.

Vivian pulls off her blouse and skirt.

VIVIAN
That means you want the blowjob
first.

Edward smiles, somewhat embarrassed by her bluntness.

EDWARD
Does it?

VIVIAN
Yeah. You don't mind wearing a
rubber, do you?

EDWARD
Seems like a good precaution.

VIVIAN
You look clean but these days you
never know. I don't do it in the
ass, either ... unless you want to
pay extra.
19.

She removes her panty hose. Naked but for a pair of black
panties, she sits down on the floor and carefully lays her
Clothes out on the carpet, smoothing them down so they won't get
wrin. er

Edward sits on the bed and watches her, fascinated.

EDWARD
What are you doing?

VIVIAN
I don't want my clothes to get
mushed up.

EDWARD
You could hang them in the closet.

VIVIAN
This is fine.

Vivian stands and walks to Edward. She gives him a quick peck on
the cheek.

VIVIAN
Here, I'll help you out of your
clothes.

She undoes his tie and pulis it from his shirt. Edward grabs her
wrists, firmly but gent

EDWARD
Hey. Slow down. I thought I had you
for the whole night.

VIVIAN
(evenly)
Yeah, you got me. Just most guys
like it quick.

EDWARD
Well, then I'm not like most guys.

Guiding her by the wrists, Edward slowly pushes her back onto
the bed covers. He releases her and settles in beside her. He
runs a finger across her thighs.

Vivian lies back in the bed covers, bored. Edward's fingers pet
her stomach. Vivian winces.

VIVIAN
That tickles.

Edward smiles and touches her stomach again. Vivian sits up
quickly.

VIVIAN
(firmly)
That tickles. I don't like it.
20.

EDWARD
Sorry. What do you like?

VIVIAN
(annoyed)
Hot baths and white rocks. Okay? If
I want some gay to turn me on I'll
pay you_two- ty. I'm here to Take
you feel good. so" lay down.

Vivian pushes Edward back onto the bed. She unbuttons his shirt.

VIVIAN
Jesus, champagne, strawberries,
mints, and greplay- You act_like
you're seducing a Valley girl you
picked up in a dance club.

Edward laughs. Vivian undoes his pants.

EDWARD
I'm an incurable romantic.

VIVIAN
Yeah. Well, you were cruising the
wrong boulevard for romance.
(beat)
But if you want a good fuck, you
found the best. Just lay down and
let me drive.

Vivian lips off the bed and walks to the lights switch. She
turns it off.

In the faint light that leaks through the cracks in the door, we
see her return to Edward. She lies on top of him and kisses him
full on the lips. Edward wraps his arms around her.
They make love.

DISSOLVE TO:
INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT
Vivian turns on a light. The bathroom is large, decorated in
gray tile and gold trim. There is a huge sunken bathtub in the
corner of the room.
Vivian looks at herself in the mirror. He hair is tangled and
loose, and her body damp with sweat. With her fingers she combs
out her hair to untangle it.
She unrolls a handful of toilet paper and wipes the sweat from
her forehead and neck. She uses her finger to adjust the smeared
line of her lipstick

She turns off the light.
INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

21.

Vivian is sitting on the floor picking up her clothes. Edward
e

slides over on t bed to see her.

EDWARD
What are you doing?

. VIVIAN
Getting my clothes.

EDWARD
I thought we had all night.

VIVIAN
What? You want to do it again? I
thought I finished you of

EDWARD
You did. But stay the night. I'd
like to sleep with you, I'll get
you a taxi in the morning.

Vivian sighs.

VIVIAN .
Why do you want to sleep with me?

EDWARD
I don't like to sleep alone.

VIVIAN
Your girlfriend fucking spoils you.

EDWARD
She does.

Vivian stands up and walks over to the bed.

VIVIAN
Alright. Move over, Romeo.

INT. HALLWAY - MORNING

The elevator doors open and a waiter rolls a cart out into the
hallway. He takes it to the doors of the penthouse. He rings the

bell.

INT. PENTHOUSE LIVING ROOM - MORNING

Edward, dressed in silk pajamas and a black velvet robe, stands

in the living room talking into a cordless phone.

EDWARD
If you really miss me then take a
plane and get out here.

The chimes ring. Edward covers the receiver with his hand.
22.

EDWARD
Come in! It's open.

The door opens and the waiter carries in a covered tray of food,
a bottle of champagne, and a pitcher of orange juice.

EDWARD
Just set it down over there.

Edward points to a dining table in a corner of the room. The
waiter does as requested.

Edward speaks back into the phone.

EDWARD
Cindy? Yes. I don't care what your
agent says. A one-week vacation
isn't going to ruin your career.

The waiter sets down the tray and returns through the living
room. Edward picks up his wallet from an end table and hands the
waiter a five- dollar” bill. The waiter nods and exits.

EDWARD
I want you here. You know how I get
when I'm doing business. Do you
know how much this deal is worth?

Edward walks over to the dining table and lifts one of the tray
covers. Inside is a gourmet breakfast.

EDWARD

(becoming angry)
You promised me when you started
this whole modeling thing that I
would still come first. Now I'm
telling you to get out here. Today.

(beat)
Cindy!

She's hung up on him. Edward slams the phone down on the table.

EDWARD
Spoiled bitch.

Edward takes a deep breath to calm himself. He pours a glass of
orange juice and takes a sip. Still agitated, he crosses through
the living room to the bedroom door.

INT. BEDROOM - MORNING

Vivian is asleep in the bed. She is not a light sleeper. He body
is in an awkward position and her mouth is frozen half open on
her tranquil face. She looks young and childlike.

Edward stares down at her for a moment. He sips his orange
juice. He is thinking again. Making a decision.
23.

EDWARD
(loudly)
You're quite a sleeper.

Vivian stirs roughly.

EDWARD
Good. morning. Would you like some
breakfast?

Vivian's eyes open painfully and she squints at Edward. She
shakes her head, trying to wake up.

VIVIAN
I forgot where I was.

EDWARD
That must be an occupational
hazard.

EDWARD

This is a nice bed. It's so soft. I
slept like a stiff.

EDWARD
Would you like some breakfast? It's
still hot.

VIVIAN

I don't eat in the morning.

EDWARD
You should. Come on.

Edward picks up his shirt from the night before and tosses it to
er.

INT. DINING TABLE IN THE LIVING ROOM - MORNING

Vivian wears Edward's shirt as they sit at the dining ta table.
Edward dishes out some food and sets it in front of her

VIVIAN
My head hurts. It's that champagne
you made me choke down.
Edward pulls the champagne bottle from its bucket.

EDWARD
Some hair of the dog.

He deftly pops the cork.

VIVIAN
No. I'll get sick.

Edward fills a third of the glass and tops it off with orange
juice.
24.

EDWARD
Just a bit. With orange juice. I
guarantee it will make you feel
better.

Vivian reluctantly takes the glass.

_ VIVIAN . ;
I don't like orange juice either.

EDWARD
Don't you like anything?

Vivian swallows some orange juice.

VIVIAN
White rocks. Hot baths.

EDWARD
Well, you're welcome to take a nice
long bath. The one in the bathroom
is practically a pool.

VIVIAN
I saw it, but I have to go.

She picks up a fork and starts examining the food on her plate.
Edward begins to eat.

EDWARD
I wanted to talk to you about that.

VIVIAN
What is this stuff?
She eats a forkful.

EDWARD
Crepes.

VIVIAN ;
It's good. The orange juice isn't
that bad neither.

She takes another sip.

EDWARD
I'm going to be in town until next
Friday. I'm involved in an
important business deal and I'm not
going to have the energy to try to
chase down girls when I need to
relax...

Vivian is wolfing down the food hungrily.

VIVIAN
(her mouth full)
You want my number? But I charge
more on Saturdays.
(MORE )
25.

VIVIAN (CONT'D)
Especially if you want to do the
sleeping thing. I'd lose a lot of
business.

EDWARD
Heyy slow down. I'm not going to
e your plate away from you.

VIVIAN
Sorry. I guess I was hungry after
all. So you want my number?

She finishes off her glass and refills it, this time favoring
the champagne.

EDWARD
Actually, I was wonderin
would like to stay here git t .
week.

Vivian tries to conceal her surprise at his offer. Not many
people are interested in her during the day. It takes her a
moment to respond.

VIVIAN
(trying to act cool)
It'd cost ya.

EDWARD
How much? Let's see if I can afford
it.

VIVIAN
Well, seven full nights and days,
too?

EDWARD

Yes. You can do what you want
during the days, but I'd like to
have you on call, so to speak.

VIVIAN
Two thousand.

Edward sports the same faint smile that he always gets when he's
negotiating money.

EDWARD
Hmmm. Two fifty a night for seven
ights is only seventeen hundred
and fifty dollars.

VIVIAN
But you want me during the days,
too. And last night you didn't get
me 'til after twelve. I did some
good money before you picked me up.

EDWARD
I'm sure you did' but seven nights
of steady work.

(MORE )
26.

EDWARD (CONT'D)
Shouldn't I get a discount or
something? How about fifteen
hundred?

VIVIAN
Don't be an asshole. You know
you, ve got two thousand. This
ucking room must cost you a couple
hundred a night.

Edward smiles broadly at that. Vivian notices.

VIVIAN
Or more!

EDWARD
I like to know I'm getting my
money's worth. I struck a good deal
on this room, too.

VIVIAN
(firmly
Two thousand.

Edward pours himself some more orange juice.

EDWARD

Alright. I like you. Two thousand
it is. But let me tell you, I have
very tough business to do. There is
a lot of pressure involved. When I
get tense, I need someone to help
me relax. That means no problems.
No hassles. Understand?

The thought of all that money is starting to warm Vivian's
voice.

VIVIAN
Sure, honey. I'll treat you like a
prince for a week. Anything, any
way you want.

EDWARD
I'm not just talking about sex. I
need some nice pleasant company.

VIVIAN
I'll treat you so nice you'll never
want to let me go.

EDWARD
Fine. But I will go. This is only
for a week. I want you to be clear
on that, too.

VIVIAN
Hey, I'll be looking forward to
spending my money when you're gone.

Edward smiles.
27.

EDWARD
I wish my jawyer was that honest.
So it's a

VIVIAN

I need to go back to Hollywood and
get some things.

EDWARD
No, I want you to stay here while
you're with me. I don't want any
trouble. We'll buy anything you
need. What do you want?

Vivian smiles awkwardly.

VIVIAN
Well, a little bit of rock. Just to
get me through the week. I'll pay
or it mysel

EDWARD
No. No drugs. Not while you're with
me.

VIVIAN

I just need a little buzz. It's no
different than champagne.

E DWARD
Ghampagne is legal. Drugs are
illega That's enough of a
difference to me.

VIVIAN
I can't go a whole week without
getting high.

EDWARD
(shrugs )
Then I'll have to call Room Service
and get another girl.

Vivian sits in silence for a moment. Edward watches her for the
corner of his eye. He enjoys negotiating. Vivian's face
toughens. She looks at Edward levelly.

VIVIAN
Alright. A week. But I want three
thousand.

Edward studies her for a moment. He knows when to close a deal.

EDWARD
That's fair. Hardship pay. Three
thousand dollars for one week, no
drugs, no strings attached.

VIVIAN
It's a deal.
28.

INT. BATHROOM - MORNING

Vivian is stretched out in a hot bubble bath. Her face shows
almost orgasmic pleasure. She starts to laugh.

VIVIAN
Three thousand! Three thousand
fucking dollars!

Laughing, she lays back and sinks down into the warm bubbly
water and disappears.

She pops back up, shakes out her hair and laughs again.

VIVIAN
Three thousand!

Edward comes into the bathroom and stands by the door, watching
her laugh. He has just finished dressing and is trying to get
is tie tied.

EDWARD
Happy, huh?

VIVIAN
Listen, lover. When I'm not giving
you the best fucks of your life,
I'm gonna be right here, in this
tub. Have Room Service bring the
cart in.

She laughs.

VIVIAN
Three thousand. To sit in a bathtub
for seven days.

EDWARD
I'm overpaying you, aren't I?

VIVIAN
Hey, I'd have taken a thousand, but
we both know you can put up three,
can't you?

EDWARD
(smoothly)
I don't think it will break me.

VIVIAN
Then it's a good deal for us both.
I'll keep you happy, lover.

EDWARD
Good. I've got to meet with some
people. I'll probably be gone most
of the day.

VIVIAN
I'll be right here.
29.

Edward is still struggling with his tie.

EDWARD
I can never get these things right.
Cindy always does them for me. Do
you know how to do these?

Vivian_slides over to the edge of the tub and wipes her hands on
a towel.

VIVIAN
Let me see.

Edward walks over to the tub and leans over. Vivian reaches up
and tries to tie his tie.

VIVIAN
How does this go?

She makes a mess of it. She undoes it and tries again.

EDWARD
Forget it. You're killing my back.

VIVIAN
No, let me try again. I_ got to
learn how to Spoil you like your
girlfriend does.

Edward continues to hunch over. Vivian finally gets something
that is almost close.

VIVIAN
There.

Edward straightens up and glances in a mirror.

EDWARD
Close enough. You have the rest of
the week to practice.

Edward reaches into his wallet and pulls out his American
Express Gold Card. He sets it down on the sink.

EDWARD
Here. Buy some nice clothes on
Rodeo Drive. A few dresses, but not
too fancy, or too sexy. Soft pinks
and pastels are nice. I just want
You to look presentable in the
otel, understand?

VIVIAN
Yeah. You want me to dress like
your high-class girlfriend.

EDWARD
Well, let's hope you don't spend
that much.
30.

VIVIAN
How much can I spend?

EDWARD
Be reasonable. You seem like a
smart girl. I'll make you a deal.
If you spend too much I'll send it
all back at the end of the week. If
you're sensible, I'll let you keep
it. Fair?

VIVIAN
Fair.

Edward walks over and kisses her on the cheek.

EDWARD
Bye.

VIVIAN
Bye, lover. It's gonna be a fun
week.

Edward smiles and exits. Vivian relaxes back in her tub.

VIVIAN
Three ... thousand ... dollars.

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

Vivian is back in her street clothes, lounging about on an art
deco couch, talking on the cordless phone.

VIVIAN
You wouldn't believe it, babe. It's
like out of Dynasty or something.
It's a gas. He's leaving next
Friday. I'll be back then.

We hear Kit's voice on the other end of the phone.

KIT (0.S.)
But Viv, I don't have any money.
What will I do 'til you get back?

VIVIAN
Work, baby. You're supposed to be
working. I'm not your mother. I'll
handle the rent, you just keep
yourself going for a week. Pick up
some blowjobs. You can do that.

KIT (0.S.)
(softly)
Okay.
VIVIAN

Listen, baby. I'm making good
money. Good money.
(MORE )
31.

VIVIAN (CONT'D)
When I get back we're gonna move to
the Strip and work the good part of
town. Just like I promised. We'll
get a nice place, not like that
shithole we're in now. I always
told you I could get the class
tricks.

KIT (0.8.

That's cause You, re pretty, Viv.
But I don't think I could work the
Strip. I'm not pretty like you.

VIVIAN
Babe, I'm telling you we'll get
our hair done up right and you'll
e a knockout. Okay?

KIT (0.S.)
Okay.

VIVIAN
You take care of yourself. I'll be
back in a week. It's not that long.

KIT (0.S.)
Okay.

VIVIAN
Bye, baby.

KIT (0.S.)
Bye.

Vivian presses a button to hang up the phone and sets it down on
the table. She leans back in the couch, happy and comfortable.
She pulls the American Express card from her pocket and admires
it.

VIVIAN
Time to shop.

INT. HALLWAY - DAY

Vivian is dressed in her street clothes, without the black
stockings, white coat, or heavy makeup. She doesn't look quite
so much like a hooker, but she's not altogether respectable,
either

She is waiting for the elevator. When the doors open she
saunters inside

INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

The Elevator Operator is standing by the controls as Vivian
comes in. He notices, but tries not to stare at her out-of-place
attire.

VIVIAN
(cheerfully)
Hi.
32.

OPERATOR
Hello. Lobby?

VIVIAN
Yeah.

The elevator starts down.

_ VIVIAN .
I'm going to be staying here for
awhile.

The Operator nods.

OPERATOR

Excellent.

Vivian smiles at him. He reluctantly returns it. The elevator
reaches the bottom floor and the doors open.

VIVIAN
I'll be back.

The Operator nods as she steps into the lobby.
INT. LOBBY - DAY

Vivian gets strange looks from the hotel employees and customers
as she strolls through the lobby.

At first she shrugs off the obvious rejection she sees in their
eyes, but after getting the same reaction from each person she
sees in the lobby, her savior faire begins to erode.

When she reaches the front door she hurries through it, eager to
be away from them.

EXT. HOTEL - DAY

Vivian comes out onto Wilshire Blvd. and looks around. She is
less confident and excited than she was before. She's feeling a
little lost in this strange place.

She crosses the street and heads up Rodeo Drive.

EXT. RODEO DRIVE - DAY

Vivian passes store windows, looking at the expensive things
inside. Something about it all makes her jittery.

She comes to a posh women's boutique. She hesitates for a moment
and then enters.

INT. BOUTIQUE - DAY

Vivian is no sooner in the door than she is subject to the
disapproving stare of a Saleswoman, standing behind the counter.
33.

SALESWOMAN
(with a Beverly Hills
sneer)
Can I help you?

VIVIAN
I'm just looking.

Vivian tiptoes through the shop as if it was filled with
delicate glass objects. She cautiously examines a dress.

The Saleswoman, unhappy with Vivian's clothes, appearance, and
voice, quickly comes around the counter and approaches her.

SALESWOMAN
Are you looking for something in
particular?
VIVIAN
I need some new clothes.
SALESWOMAN
(sarcastically)

Yes.

Vivian eyes the Saleswoman suspiciously. She's beginning to get
the drift. She points to a dress.

VIVIAN
How much is that?

SALESWOMAN
I don't think it would fit you.

VIVIAN
gotavs coming out)
I didn't ask if it would fit. I
asked how much.

SALESWOMAN
It's very expensive.

Vivian's body tenses as she stares at the Saleswoman, violence
in her eyes.

VIVIAN
What's with you?

SALESWOMAN
(unblinking)
Pardon?

VIVIAN
What's with this fucking look on
your face?

SALESWOMAN
I think you should leave. You're
obviously in the wrong place.
34.

Vivian is so angry and frustrated she is speechless.

SALESWOMAN

Please leave.

Vivian turns and stomps toward the door. She stops and spins
around staring at the Saleswoman incredulously.

I was
here!

__ VIVIAN ;
going to spend fucking money
What's with you?

The Saleswoman says nothing. Vivian flips her off. She throws
the door open and storms outside.

The Saleswoman calmly walks back to her counter and returns to

her place.
EXT. RODEO DRIVE

Vivian comes out
eyeing Vivian as
eyes water up to
herself.

She looks up and
elegant designer

— DAY

onto the street and stands, lost. A man passes,
if she were a freak. Vivian's face is red. He
cry. She takes a deep breath, trying to control

down for another shop. On the street, women in
outfits stroll by. Vivian suddenly feels naked.

She heads back to the hotel.

INT. HOTEL - DAY

Vivian enters the Tobby, nervous and paranoid. She heads toward
s

the elevators. She fee

sight of all the

an emptiness in her stomach at the
luxury around her. Only this time she doesn't

have Edward to guide her. She is surrounded by it but not a part

of it.

Mr. Thomas, the
crosses the room

May I

prim, middle-aged hotel manager, spots her. He

and deftly cuts her off from the elevator.

MR. THOMAS
help you, miss?

Vivian stops, practically shaking with terror.

VIVIAN

I'm just going up to my room.

MR. THOMAS

You're a guest here?

I'm...

VIVIAN
I'm with a friend.

MR. THOMAS

And who is that?
35.

VIVIAN
Edward...

Vivian's face fills with terror. She doesn't know his last name.
He hands are trembling.

MR. THOMAS
What's the matter?

VIVIAN
I'm...

The elevator doors open behind them. She spots the Operator.
VIVIAN
(blurting it out)
He knows me!
Mr. Thomas turns and eyes the Operator curiously. The Operator
looks back at them innocently. With a smooth gesture Mr. Thomas
waves the Operator over.

MR. THOMAS
Do you know this young lady?

The Operator nods.

OPERATOR
She's with Mr. Harris.
MR. THOMAS
(Surprised)
Mr. Harris?
_.,.. OPERATOR
She joined him last night,
apparently.
VIVIAN

(voice quaking)
I just want to go back to my room.

Mr. Thomas' tone toward Vivian changes dramatically. He waves
the Operator away.

MR. THOMAS
Are you alright?

VIVIAN
I just want to go back to my room.

MR. THOMAS.
Why don't you come with me? We'll
chat for a moment.

He takes her by the arm and leads her off.
36.

INT. HOTEL OFFICE - DAY

In a richly furnished office, Mr. Thomas places Vivian in a
comfortable chair and then leans against the edge of his desk.
As he addresses her, his voice is firm, but warm. Fatherly.

MR. THOMAS
wy dear, I want you to understand
that there are certain things that
don't happen in the Beverly
Wilshire. Things that go on in
other hotels. You understand?

Vivian says nothing.

MR. THOMAS
But Mr. Harris is a very special
customer of this hotel. And we like
to think of our special customers
as friends. As a customer, I would
expect Mr. Harris to sign in any
additional guests that he wants to
spend the night. But as a friend,
we're willing to overlook it. I'm
assuming you're a relative. You
must be his niece.

Vivian finds herself nodding.

MR. THOMAS
Of course. Naturally when Mr.
Harris leaves, I won't see you in
this hotel again. Correct?

Vivian nods.
MR. THOMAS
I would also encourage you to dress
in a more appropriate manner.

Vivian quickly pulls out her American Express card and hands it
to him as if it somehow validates her actions.

VIVIAN
I_was trying to get some other
clothes... but... they wouldn't...

She can't go on. Mr. Thomas politely glances at the American
Express card and hands it back to her. He sighs wearily. The
things he must do to keep his "friends" happy.

He walks around his desk and picks up the phone. He dials a
number.

MR. THOMAS
(into the phone)
Women's clothing.
beat)
Could I speak to Bridget.

Bridget, hello.
(MORE )
37.

MR. THOMAS (CONT'D)
This is Mr. Thomas at the Beverly
Wilshire. Well, that's flattering.
Listen, I'm going to send someone
to you. She's the distant niece of
a special customer of ours. A very
special customer: Mr, Harris. Yes,
the Long Island Harrises. His niece
is... from out of town. You know.
And she needs a little help
dressing. Maybe you could help he
pick something. Thank you very
much. She'll be right over.

Mr Thomas sets the phone down and smiles patronizingly at
Vivian.

MR. THOMAS
There you are. Go to Saks down the
street. It's a tall black building
not far from here, thankfully. Go
straight to the second floor and
ask for Bridget. She'll take care
of you.

Vivian stands up. She's calmer now.

VIVIAN
Thanks.

MR. THOMAS
If you have any other problems come
ask for me personally. I'm Mr.
Thomas.

Vivian nods. He shows her to the door. She exits. He watches her
go, unhappy about the whole matter.

INT. SAKS - SECOND FLOOR - DAY

The elevator opens and Vivian walks out and surveys the room
nervously. She wanders toward the women's clothing section.

Bridget, a large friendly woman, spots her.

BRIDGET
You must be Mr. Harris' niece.

Vivian nods.

BRIDGET
What's your name, dear?

VIVIAN
Vivian.

VIVIAN

Well, the mini-skirt is dead,
Vivian. I don't care how many
designers try to bring it back,
it's dead. Goodness, you_look like
a streetwalker in that. Let's find
you something else. Come on.
38.

Bridget leads Vivian into the racks of clothes.

BRIDGET
Where are you from dear?

Vivian is silent for awhile.

VIVIAN
Ohio.

BRIDGET
No wonder. How about this?

Bridget holds up a brown designer dress.
VIVIAN
(timidly)
Do you have anything in soft pink?
Bridget studies Vivian for a moment.

BRIDGET
Like a pastel?

INT. SAKS - DAY

Vivian is dressed in a pink pastel dress with fine white beading
around the neck and shoulders and a tiny lace collar.

BRIDGET
You look lovely.

Vivian nods. She seems dazed and weary. She hands Bridget the
American Express card. Bridget takes it.

BRIDGET
Do you have any shoes for it?

Vivian shakes her head. Bridget leads her off.

BRIDGET
Come, come.

INT. SAKS - DAY

Bridget is ringing up Vivian's new dress and matching hat,
purse, and shoes. She packs Vivian's old clothes in a paper bag.
he hands Vivian the small credit card form.

BRIDGET
Just sign here.

Vivian signs.

BRIDGET
We have a salon on the third floor.
Maybe you'd like to get your hair
and nails done?
39.

Vivian glances at her nails. They are a hideous shade of bright
red.

BRIDGET
Go on. It's a treat. By the time
you get back to Ohio they'll think
you were born in Beverly Hills.

EXT. WILSHIRE BLVD. - DAY

Vivian's nails are pink. Her hair is cut and styled more
conservatively and done up in a bun. She wears a soft white hat
and pink shoes and a pink dress. In her hands is a pink and
white purse. He makeup has been redone. She walks down Wilshire,
still quiet and dazed. But lovely.

She carries a bag with her working clothes. She stops at a
trashcan and throws the offending items away. Hoping no one
notices.

She approaches the hotel and pauses. He eyes are drawn to the
other side of the street: Rodeo Drive. It seems ominous to her.

She takes a breath and crosses the street.

EXT. RODEO DRIVE - DAY

Vivian walks up Rodeo Drive again. Her manner is uneasy, but
determined, as if forced to stroll down a dangerous street on a
dare. She is better armed this time, in a suit of impenetrable
pink armor.

She darts by the boutique that kicked her out, trying not to be

seen by the saleswoman on the other side of the window.
She continues on to another shop. She takes a breath and enters.
INT. ANOTHER BOUTIQUE - DAY

Vivian strolls through the store, poker-faced but weak at the
knees. She stops at a dress and fingers it.

Another Saleswoman comes up alongside her.
ANOTHER SALESWOMAN
It's very pretty. Would you like to
try it on?
Vivian turns and looks at the saleswoman for a moment. Blood
flows back to her skin. Vivian flashes a trademark Beverly Hills
bitch sneer.

VIVIAN
Why not?

EXT. RODEO DRIVE - DAY

Vivian strolls up the street, carrying a clothing box. Her step
is lively, and her face has a trace of a snotty smile.
40.

A well-dressed man passes by, smiling politely. Vivian's nose
lifts as she happily ignores him.

She heads for another shop
INT. BOUTIQUE #3 - DAY

Vivian is in a dressing stall, tossing a dress outside to a
Nervous Saleswoman.

VIVIAN
Nope.

Another Nervous Saleswoman comes up, holding a long purple
evening gown.

A.N.S.
How about this one?

VIVIAN
Ick! I want something in a pastel.
That's horrid.

The Nervous Saleswoman is frantically hanging up some of the
other clothes Vivian tried on.

NERVOUS SALESWOMAN
There's a _mint green dress in the
window...?

VIVIAN
Yes! Let me try that on.

EXT. RODEO DRIVE - DAY

Vivian's arms are filled with clothing boxes and bags. She has
perfected her Beverly Hills sneer. She owns this block.

On her way back to the hotel she returns to the first boutique.
Without a beat of hesitation she marches in.

INT. BOUTIQUE - DAY

Vivian, her hat partially obscuring her face from the
Saleswoman, sails into the store carrying all her boxes and,
bags. The Saleswoman smiles to hersel’ viously a professional
shopper.

Vivian strides over to the dress she originally looked at. She
fingers it roughly.

SALESWOMAN
(eagerly)
Isn't it pretty? It's on sale.
Vivian abruptly faces the Saleswoman and stares at her coldly.

VIVIAN
It wouldn't fit me.
41.

Vivian marches toward the front door. She turns back to the
Saleswoman, who is trying to remember who Vivian is.

Vivian flips her off again, just to remind her.
VIVIAN
(coolly)
Bye.
Vivian exits. The Saleswoman stares after her.

INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL - DAY

Vivian walks confidently through the hotel lobby, past the
admiring gazes of several businessmen. She enters the elevator.

INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

In the elevator, Vivian gripping her packages like loot from a
conquered city. The Operator doesn't recognize her. He starts
the elevator up.

OPERATOR
Floor, ma'am?

VIVIAN
(smoothly)
Penthouse.

The Operator does a double take. Vivian smiles at him.

VIVIAN

Hi again. Like my new dress?
OPERATOR

It's... lovely.
VIVIAN

Mr. Thomas picked it out for me.

OPERATOR
Oh...?

They reach the top floor. The doors open. Vivian steps out.

VIVIAN
Bye.

The Operator watches her go.
INT. PENTHOUSE LIVING ROOM - SUNSET
Vivian, still in her pink dress but without the hat, stands in

front of the glass windows, staring out into the city
reflectively.
42.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY - EVENING

Edward steps to the front desk and catches the eye of a Desk
Clerk.

EDWARD
Any messages?

DESK CLERK
Yes, Mr. Harris.

He hands Edward a few message slips and a telegram. Edward sorts
through them. He is tired and on edge.

Mr. Thomas, standing at the other end of the front desk, sees
Edward. He deftly approaches him and speaks in a low intimate
voice.

MR. THOMAS
Good evening, Mr. Harris.

Edward continues looking through his messages.

EDWARD
(absently)
Hello.

MR. THOMAS
I met your ... "niece" in the lobby
today.

EDWARD
(looking up)
My niece?

MR. THOMAS
That pretty young girl staying in
your room. I just assumed...

Edward's and Mr. Thomas' eyes meet. They are engaging in some
sort of subtle power struggle, a struggle that Edward intends to
win.

EDWARD
I don't have a niece.

MR. THOMAS
Ah, my mistake.

EDWARD
That pretty young girl in my room
is a prostitute.
Mr. Thomas can't think how to respond.

EDWARD
Do you have a problem with that?
43.

MR. THOMAS
(softly)
No, sir. Have a good evening.

Mr. Thomas bows slightly and walks away. Edward watches him go
and turns back to the Desk Clerk, suddenly in a good mood.

EDWARD
Have some champagne sent up. And a
cheese tray or something. Maybe a
paté and some bread. A large yottle
of mineral water. And strawberries.

DESK CLERK
Yes, sir.

INT. PENTHOUSE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Vivian is sitting demurely on the couch when Edward comes in
from the hall e stands up and looks at him. She smoothes her
dress anxiously.

VIVIAN
Do you like it?

Edward strolls down the steps to the living room, studying her.
He smiles.

EDWARD
It's lovely.

Vivian sighs with relief.

VIVIAN
I had my hair done. I hope that was
okay.

EDWARD

Yes. I like it.

Edward gives her a quick kiss and sits down in a chair,

exhausted. He loosens his tie and uses one foot to try to slide

the shoe off the other. It's stuck. He reaches down to untie the
shoe, but before he can Vivian practically throws herself at his
eet.

VIVIAN
Here, let me help you.

Vivian kneels at his feet and unties his shoes. She pulls them
off and sets them down next to the chair.

VIVIAN
Socks too?

EDWARD
That's alright. My feet were just
swelling w
(pause
(MORE )
44,

EDWARD (CONT'D)
I had an interesting talk with the
hotel manager downstairs.

VIVIAN
(looking down)

Edward takes Vivian's chin in one hand and raises her head. He
looks into her eyes.

EDWARD
Listen to me. I don't know what
happened with you two, but I don't
care. I'm paying a bundle for this
room and I expect to be treated
with respect. That includes you. If
anyone hassles you, or makes you
feel uncomfortable, you tell me.
I'll see that they're fired
promptly. That includes Mr. Thomas.
Understand?

VIVIAN

(happily)
Yeah.

EDWARD
I don't care whether you're a
prostitute, my wife, my niece, or
he First Lady. As long as you're
my guest, the people in this hotel
will treat you like a queen.
Alright? If I have to, I'll buy the
hotel and burn it down to prove my
point.

Vivian smiles brightly. He lets go of her chin and relaxes in
his chair.

EDWARD
Now, it looks as if you did some
shopping...

Vivian reaches over to the end table and picks up a pile of
credit card receipts.

VIVIAN
I saved all the receipts. I bought
three dresses and some other stuff.
ghat hat over there goes with this
ress.

EDWARD
Only three dresses?

VIVIAN
Well, I didn't figure I'd be going
out a lot. And clothes are so
expensive around here.

(MORE )
45.

VIVIAN (CONT'D)
I got two of them on sale, but even
then it all came to eight hundred
and fifty-seven dollars. I could
have done better at Sears or
something but...

__ EDWARD /
That's fine. You could teach Cindy
a lesson in saving money.

VIVIAN
(eagerly)
You want to see what I bought?

Edward couldn't care less, but he decides to indulge her.

EDWARD
Yes, I'd love to.

Vivian jumps up, runs to the couch, and picks one of the boxes
she brought home. She opens it to reveal a long mint green
dress.

She unzips her dress and pulls it off. Underneath she is wearing
a soft pink teddy. She picks up the green dress and starts to
put it on.

EDWARD
(smiling)
New underwear too?

Vivian stops pulling up her green dress. She lets it drop to the
floor and models the teddy.

VIVIAN
Yeah, like it?

EDWARD
Very much.

VIVIAN

Good, I got another one that
matches this dress.

She steps out of the green dress and runs over to a bag
containing some underwear. She throws off the pink teddy and
puts on the green one.

VIVIAN
How's that?

EDWARD
Nice.

VIVIAN

And I got a white one too, for my
yellow dress. I couldn't find a
yellow one.

She holds up the white teddy.
46.

VIVIAN
I_kinda thought they were sexy. But
classy too...

EDWARD
Yes.

The front door chimes.

EDWARD
That's Room Service.

VIVIAN
joking)
Maybe I should answer it in my
teddy. Give him a thrill?

EDWARD
Let's not.

VIVIAN
(embarrassed)
No. I wasn't going to. I was just
kidding.

Vivian pulls on the mint green dress. She zips up and darts up
the steps to the door. She pulls the door open to reveal a
Bellboy with a tray of food.

BELLBOY
Room Service.

VIVIAN
Come on in. Put it down there.

The Bellboy carries the tray down the stairs. He sets it down
and returns to the door. Without getting up from the chair,
Edward hands him a five-dollar bill as he passes.

After he has exited, Vivian shuts the door.

Edward wearily gets up and walks over to the tray of food. He
pulls the champagne from the bucket and pops the cork. He pours
a glass for Vivian. He opens the mineral water and pours some
into a champagne glass.

As Vivian comes down the steps Edward hands her the champagne.
Vivian takes it. Edward holds up his glass of water.

EDWARD
Cheers.

They clink their glasses together. Vivian quickly sips the
champagne.

VIVIAN
I'm starting to like this stuff.

She returns to her clothes and takes off her green dress.
47.

VIVIAN
Let me show you the yellow one.

She pulls it from the box and puts it on. It has a conservative,
almost businesslike look to it.

VIVIAN
Like it?

Edward carries the bottle of champagne over to her and refills
her glass. He kisses her.

EDWARD
I like it. I'm pleased.

Vivian takes another long swallow of champagne.

VIVIAN
Great. Now I'll show you the good
stuff.

EDWARD

The good stuff?

VIVIAN
(between champagne sips)
Well, I figured you weren't going
to be taking me out _a lot, so I
figured what I really needed was
some sexy lingerie for when I was
in.

Vivian moves over_to another set of boxes. She pauses and eyes
Edward suggestively.

VIVIAN
Why don't you relax while I show
you?
Edward sits down.
Montage of Vivian's outpits

As Edward sits in the chair Vivian changes from outfit to
outfit.

She slides up to him in a sexy long white lace and silk
nightgown. She does a turn so he can see it.

He smiles. Vivian tosses the nightgown into his lap as she tries
on something else.

She takes a long sip from her champagne glass as she shows him a
sexy pair of red tap pants and matching camisole.

Edward refills her glass as she shows him a black corset and
long stockings.

Vivian tosses the stockings onto Edward. He is accumulating a
pile of lingerie on his lap.
48.

Vivian comes up to him in a short bright pink nightie. Very
drunk, she sits on his lap and finishes off the last of her
champagne.

She lets the glass drop to the carpet and kisses him.

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

Edward carries a drunk Vivian into the bedroom and gently lays
her out on the bed.

VIVIAN
Did I do good?

Edward rolls her into the covers.

EDWARD
Yes.

He takes off his coat and shirt.

VIVIAN
I got most of it at this great
sale. A lot of it is olyester, but
that white one is real silk

Edward pulls off his pants and climbs into bed with her. She
pulls him into her arms and snuggles up to him drunkenly.

VIVIAN
It only cost around two thirty-
five.

EDWARD

You did very well.
VIVIAN
(a little worried)
are, you going to let me keep it
a. ?

EDWARD
Yes. It's yours.

Vivian's eyes light up. She kisses Edward passionately.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

Vivian and Edward eat breakfast at the living room dining table.
Vivian is dressed in one of her sexy nightgowns.

VIVIAN
What do you do all day while you're
gone?
49,

EDWARD
Meet with lawyers and stockbrokers.
Read financial reports. It's pretty
boring.

VIVIAN
What's it for?

EDWARD
I'm acquiring a company.

VIVIAN
What kind of company?

EDWARD
It's called Kross Enterprises. It
used to build ships. Nowadays it
doesn't do much of anything.

VIVIAN
Why would you want it?

Edward takes a sip of his orange juice and looks at Vivian
sideways.

EDWARD

Are you really curious?
VIVIAN

Yeah.
EDWARD

Alright. Warn me if I bore you.
Twenty years ago Kross was a huge
corporation, and even though
they're on the verge of bankruptcy
today they | still have millions in
assets ings like real estate,
equipment, pension funds. Things
that can be liquidated to generate
cash. You understand?

VIVIAN
What are pension funds?

EDWARD
That's cash invested in various
accounts - It's supposed to be used
pa y worker's retirement and

hea th benefits. Sometimes it's
hard to get_at because of various
government laws, but with good

awyers you can usually strip them
down since only part of them have
been contractually promised to the
employees. Anyhow, we figure Kross
is worth about 400 million. We hope
we can acquire it for between two
and three hundred million. No
matter what, I'm going to make a
profit. The question is how large.
50.

VIVIAN
(thinking hard)
If it's worth that much money, why
doesn't somebody else try to buy
it?

EDWARD
Try is the key word there. Other
people have tried. But not that
many | people have a few hundred
million to toy around with like
this. And I know about assets the
corporation owns that other people
aren't aware of. Financial
statements say the corporation is
only worth around 300 million. I
know it's worth more than that. In
fact, it may be worth even more
than’ 400 ttitlion, if I'm right
about certain things. We'll’ see.
The other problem is that the
management of the company isn't
particularly happy about the idea
of being sold ecause they'll lose
their jobs.

VIVIAN
Oh.

EDWARD
I wouldn't lose any sleep over
them. They got the corporation into
mess it's in now.

VIVIAN
Bo bey can make all that money just
uying it and then selling
Oy rte

EDWARD
It's not quite that simple, but
yes.

VIVIAN
(admiringly)
What a racket!

EDWARD
(smiling)
Yes.

VIVIAN
Is that how you got so rich? Buying
companies?

EDWARD
No. It's been passed down through
the family. But I have more than
tripled it in the last seven years.
These are good days for making
money.
51.

VIVIAN
That's great.

Edward shrugs.

EDWARD
I'm going to have to get dressed, I
have a meeting at ten. Tomorrow
I'll give you'a lesson in short
selling.

_VIVIAN
(happily)
Okay.
EDWARD

You're a good listener. I like
that.

He stands up and gives her a kiss on the cheek.
INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

Edward, fully dressed, is standing at the front door as Vivian
ties his tie. She finishes.

VIVIAN
There you go.
EDWARD
How does it look? Do I need to
check it?
VIVIAN
No. I've got it down. It looks
great.
They kiss.
EDWARD

I'll see you this evening.

He exits. Vivian stands by the door for a moment and then walks
down the living room steps.

She opens a large cabinet in the wall that conceals a
television. She switches it on and sits on the couch.

DISSOLVE TO:
INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

Vivian is stretched out on the couch. She had been watching
television for hours. She flips through the channels using a
remote control. There's nothing on.

She turns the television off. She lays her head down on the
couch and stares off, bored.
52.

INT. BROKERAGE HOUSE - DAY

Edward is being led through the hallways of a brokerage house by
Vance, a well-dressed young stockbroker.

VANCE
We can't buy any more stock without
filing. I just can't conceal it any
longer. We might hide it under
another name for a week or two, but
we could get into trouble later.

EDWARD
No, no. Let's play by the rules.
We'll just have to move quickly.

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
Vivian is on the phone.

VIVIAN
How about hamburgers? Do you have
any hamburgers? Great. And fries.
And ketchup. Yeah. I'm in the
enthouse. The penthouse on the top
loor. Right.

EXT. HELIPORT ON TOP OF SKYSCRAPER - DAY

Edward and Vance come out of a doorway onto the rooftop of a
large skyscraper. There is a sleek corporate helicopter waiting
on a landing pad. Edward and Vance lower their heads as they
fight through the wind generated by the rotor blades.

As they near the helicopter, a young man in a business suit,
Jake, comes out to greet them. They all have to shout over the
sound of the engines.

VANCE
Mr, Harris, this is Jake Conway.
He's our top researcher. He'll be
giving us the tour.

JAKE
It's a pleasure, Mr. Harris.

EDWARD
Good to meet you.

They all climb into the helicopter. It takes off.
INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

An empty plate that once held a hamburger sits on the dining
room table. Vivian stands in front of the plate glass windows,
staring out onto the city.
53.

INT. LOBBY - DAY

Vivian comes out of the elevator wearing her mint green dress.
She strolls through the lobby on her way to the hotel dry goods
store.

She spots Mr. Thomas. With a wicked look on her face she walks
up behind him and puts an arm on his shoulder.

VIVIAN
Hi. How are you?

Mr. Thomas looks at her uncomfortably.

MR. THOMAS
Fine. Hello.

VIVIAN
How do you like my dress? Better,
hey?

MR. THOMAS

It's very pretty. The color is very
good on you.

VIVIAN
Thanks. See ya.

She smiles brightly and saunters off. Mr. Thomas watches her go,
more amused than annoyed at her.

INT. DRY GOODS STORE - DAY
Vivian buys a pack of cigarettes.
INT. BATH ROOM - DAY

Vivian sits in the bathtub smoking a cigarette. It isn't
satisfying. She tears off the filter and takes a few drags.

She gives up and tosses it into the toilet. She sinks into the
tub.

VIVIAN
How the fuck am I going to last a
week?

EXT. PORT OF LOS ANGELES - DAY
A helicopter flies over the port.
INT. HELICOPTER - DAY

They look over a huge shipyard as Jake describes it for Edward.
54.

JAKE
This is the jewel in Kross' crown.
Prime industrial property
straddling the Port of Long Beach
and Los Angeles. We can strip out
all the heavy equipment. Some of
the cranes are very valuable
overseas. World War II stuff that
nobody builds anymore because it
costs too much. The Japanese are
salivating for them.

Edward points toward one of the edges of the shipyard.

EDWARD
What's that long building over
there?

JAKE

Waste processing plant. They don't
use it anymore. Most of the yard
we'll just level. The real estate
possibilities are endless. In fact,
I talked to a couple developers --
under the table, of course -- and
they said we could

_ EDWARD
(cutting him off)
You what?

JAKE
(tentatively)
I talked to some developers about
the land.

EDWARD
What kind of idiot are you? You
don't talk to anyone about this but
me!

JAKE
I'm sorry, sir. They're close
friends; they'd never breath a
word.

Edward glares at Vance.

EDWARD
Where did you dig this moron up?

Vance turns to Jake, angrily.

VANCE
He's absolutely right, Jake. That
was an incredibly stupid thing to
oO.

EDWARD
You people are supposed to be
professionals.
55.

VANCE
It won't happen again. I'll pull
Jake off the project.

EDWARD
No. Don't bother. He's probably
already told everyone he knows.

JAKE
I'm very sorry, Mr. Harris.

EDWARD
Forget it. Let's go up the coast. I
want to look around.

INT. BROKERAGE HOUSE MEETING ROOM - DAY

Edward, Vance, and Jake enter a large meeting room. Sitting at
one end of a long conference table, Ring” of papers spread out
before him, is William, a crafty-loo' lawyer with wire-rimmed
glasses. Edward smiles broadly upon seeing him.

EDWARD
Bill! Where the hell have you been?

WILLIAM
Working on your damned pension
funds. I've found the angle. We can
bleed them dry.

EDWARD
Yeah, if your boys at the brokerage
haven't already leaked the whole
eal.

WILLIAM
Leaked! What?

EDWARD
Skip it. Jake's going to be good
from now on...
(to Jake)
...aren't you?

Edward gives Jake a friendly pat on the shoulder.

JAKE
(quietly)
Yes, sir.
EDWARD

Listen, there's something you need

to look into right away. There's a

chemical treatment plant at that
shipyard. I want you to see if the
ermits are still valid. And what
ind of limits are on them.
56.

WILLIAM
Treatment plant? What... oh! You
son of a bitch! What a brain!

EDWARD
Don't get too excited yet. Check
the permits first.

Edward sits down next to William. He glances back at the other
two men.

EDWARD
Thanks for the tour. Keep your
mouths shut. I'll see you tomorrow.

_ BOTH
Yes, sir.

They exit. William glances at Edward quizzically.

WILLIAM
What are you ragging them about?

EDWARD
Ask them. Where are we at?

WILLIAM
The Board knows.

EDWARD
Do they know it's me?

WILLIAM
Yes. A call came down from Kross.
He wants to talk to you alone.

1 PDN ARD
(laughing)
About what?

WILLIAM
Your intentions.

EDWARD
Alright.

WILLIAM
I don't think you should.

EDWARD
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

WILLIAM
I'll have to be present when you
talk.

EDWARD
No. Everyone knows you're my
muscle.

(MORE )
57.

EDWARD (CONT'D)
If the three of us sit down
together then we might as well
announce it in the Wall Street
Journal. I'll meet him in public
for dinner. Less suspicious.
Tonight, if you can arrange it.

WILLIAM
I can. But_you shouldn't go alone.
He might claim that you tried to
blackmail him or something.

EDWARD
I'll bring a girl. That'll keep it
all on a friendly level.

WILLIAM
That might do. You brought Cindy
along?

EDWARD

No, the little cunt's in New York,
pretending she's a model. World's
only five-foot two-inch model. But
I've gota little irl to keep me
company while I'm here. She'll do
for the evening.

WILLIAM
Alright. I'll set it up.

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

Vivian, dressed in a teddy, is dozing on the couch with the TV
on.

The phone rings. Vivian wakes up with a start. She looks at_it,
unsure. It rings again. She debates whether to pick up up. It
rings again.

Finally she picks it up.

VIVIAN
Hello?

EDWARD (0.S.)
(firmly)
Don't ever pick up the phone. Ever.

VIVIAN
I'm sorry. I didn't know. You
didn't tell me...

EDWARD
It's alright this time. I needed to
talk to you. But from now on, you
don't ever answer it. Understand?

VIVIAN
Yes.
58.

EDWARD

We're going out to dinner tonight.
I want you to look your best. I
don't think you have any clothes
that will do. Go buy something a
little more formal. Something dark
and low cut, but tasteful. Spend
whatever you have to. If you don't
know what to get tell the salesgirl
you're dining at the Rex. And have
your hair done. We're a little
pushed for time so I'll meet you in
he lobby at seven forty-five. Bye.

VIVIAN
Bye.

Vivian slowly sets the phone down.
INT. DRESSING ROOM AT SAKS - DAY

Vivian is ina rivate dressing room as Bridget helps her
squeeze into a tight-fitting black evening dress.

Bridget tugs upward on the sides of the strapless dress and
shakes it a bit to get Vivian's breasts in place.

BRIDGET
There we go. Take a breath.

Vivian sucks in and Bridget zips up the back. Vivian steps over
and looks at herself in a mirror.

BRIDGET
Your uncle will like this.

A sheepish look spreads across Vivian's face.

VIVIAN
He's not really my uncle.

Bridget shrugs.

BRIDGET
They never are.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

With her hair done up and bound with a string of imitation
diamonds, Vivian looks elegantly sexy in her black evening
dress. The only thing spoiling the picture as she waits in the
lobby is the sloppy way she drags on a cigarette.

She gets more than a couple of admiring glances from male hotel
patrons. She spots Mr. Thomas standing behind the check-in
counter and crosses to him.

VIVIAN
gnervous!)
How do I look?
59.

Mr. Thomas smiles politely.

MR. THOMAS
Stunning. But Miss Vivian, it
really isn't necessary for me to
approve every outfit you wear.

Vivian puffs away on her cigarette.

VIVIAN
I'm just shaking ‘cause Edward is
taking me to this really fancy
place. The Rex? Is that a nice
place?

The ashes from Vivian's cigarette fall to the carpeted floor.
Mr. Thomas winces. He slides an ashtray toward her.

VIVIAN
Oh sorry.

She stamps out her cigarette in the ashtray.

MR. THOMAS
It's a very nice restaurant.
VIVIAN
Do I look okay for it?
MR. THOMAS
You look fine. Mind what fork you
use.
VIVIAN
(absently)
Yeah...

She spots Edward entering the lobby. He gestures for her to come
to him.

VIVIAN
Got to go. Bye.

She quickly crosses the lobby toward him. As she does, her face
sours as a thought comes to her.

VIVIAN
Fork?

INT. REX RESTAURANT - NIGHT

An array of different forks is neatly lined up on the tablecloth
next to Vivian's salad plate. She stares down at them.

EDWARD (0.S.)
I'll be happy to look into it for
you. To be honest, I don't know if
we've bought any of your stock.
60.

Edward sits across the table from Vivian. He selects the last
fork on the left of the plate and begins eating the salad.

KROSS (0.S.)
Don't play any fucking games with
me, Harris. You know damn well what
stock you have and what you don't.

sitting next to Vivian is James Kross, in his carly 70s, a bulky
self-made millionaire industrialist. In his youth he was foreman
in a steel mill and during World War II pioneered the use of
welding instead of riveting in the construction of war ships.
But age is beginning to take its toll on him. His skin is

unhea thy looking and his large hands sometimes tremble when he
speaks.

He picks up the fork closest to his plate and starts to pick at
the salad.

KROSS
I know you have control over at
least twenty percent of the stock.

EDWARD
(calmly)
Then call the S.E.C.

Vivian glances back and forth between Kross and Edward's forks,
trying to figure out which one she should use. Does each person
use a different one?

KROSS
If you push me I might.

EDWARD
(politely)
Are you threatening me?

Edward_ notices Vivian out of the corner of his eye. She looks at
him helplessly. He studies her curiously.

KROSS
You might have some explaining to
do. Those gays are tired of
parasites like you jerking them
around

As he talks, Edward eyes Vivian and gently taps his finger to
the empty spot where his fork had been. Vivian gingerly picks up
that fork from her setting. Edward winks at her e starts to
eat.

EDWARD
Really, Mr. Kross. I don't think we
have anything to talk about. Maybe
you should see my lawyer.
61.

KROSS
I came here to talk to you, not to
eat _succotash or stare at your
girlfriend's tits. I want to talk
business.

Edward sets down his fork, abruptly stands, and places his
napkin next to his plate. He nods toward Vivian.

Vivian has just stuffed her mouth full of salad. She looks up at
Edward confused.

EDWARD
Let's go, Vivian.

Vivian obediently stands, still clinging to her fork.

KROSS
Harris, wait.

Kross stands as well. Edward stares at him coolly.

KROSS
I'm sorry. That was out of line.

Edward says nothing. He starts to turn away. Kross quickly turns
toward Vivian.

KROSS
Miss, I'm sorry about that remark.
I apologize. It was uncalled for.

Vivian finishes chewing and swallows quickly.

VIVIAN
Oh, it's okay.

Edward looks over at Vivian with stern sympathy.

EDWARD
Are you sure, Viv?

Edward has never called her "Viv" before. Vivian stares at him,
unsure. She doesn't know what to say; what he wants from her.
She glances at Kross, who waits for her reply.

VIVIAN
Yeah... it's okay.

Edward picks up his napkin and slowly sits. Vivian and_Kross
sit. Edward leans toward Kross and speaks to him in a low firm
voice.

EDWARD
I didn't have to come here. I don't
have to talk to you. If you have.
something to say you better say it
without threatening me or insulting
the lady.
62.

Kross' hands tremble as he adjusts his napkin onto his lap and

tries to calm down.

KROSS

I'm sorry. I'll

get to the point. I

think you're trying to take over my
company « If you do get it, and if
I

wha

ve been told about you is

true, you'll liquidate it.

(pause

)
I don't want that to happen. I
built this company up myself. I've
run it for forty years. We're in
bad shape right now, but we're
going to get through it...

As Kross talks, the waiter comes by and checks their salads.
Edward nods that he's finished. The waiter starts collecting
plates. Vivian, though she's finished her salad, is still
clinging to her fork. The waiter pauses by her side. She spots
him and sets down her fork. He whisks the plate off.

KROSS
I came here to talk to you man-to-
man to see if I can reason with
you. What do I have to do to get
you to call off the dogs?

EDWARD
I don't understand you.

KROSS
What would it cost to buy out your
stock? Name your price.

EDWARD
I really don't know. But from what
I've heard your company doesn't
have any cash.

The waiter returns with another dish. He places a plate in front

of each of them. As they

talk, Edward subtly lifts the correct

fork and taps it to the table. He half smiles at Vivian. Vivian,
studiously watching his prompting, selects the correct fork.

They both start to eat.

KROSS
Not... right now. But we're going
to get a large contract to build
four destroyers for the Navy.
They're a revolutionary design and
once we can prove it, I know we'll
get more orders. I could give you a
promissory note.

EDWARD
Then I'd be in a position of making
your company a loan. That doesn't
seem to make much sense.
63.

KROSS
We'd pay you interest. As soon as
we get the contract...

Edward shakes his head.

EDWARD
Mr Kross, you're not going to be
getting any Navy contracts.

KROSS
(upset)
What do you mean?

EDWARD
Just that. You're not going to be
getting any new contracts from the
military. know.

KROSS
(incredulous)
You've sabotaged them?

EDWARD
You flatter me if you think I can
tell the Pentagon what to do. But I
do know you aren't getting the
contract.

Kross sits quietly dazed. Much as he would like to believe it is
a lie, he knows Edward is telling the truth.

Vivian half watches him as she eats from her plate. Edward takes
a bite of his food and then speaks smoothly.

EDWARD

Now let me propose something to
you. If I ever _do decide to acquire
your company, I will of course file

proper papers with the S.E.C.
If that was to happen, I would
suggest that you and the Board
cooperate with me, rather than try
to fight it. You couldn't stop me,
you could only lower my profit
margin. If ou don't fight me, I
think you'll find I can be a
valuable friend.

Kross shakes his head, amazed at Edward's arrogance.

KROSS
You want me to recommend to the
Board that my company be raped by a
man like you?

EDWARD
It's not your company. It's a
public company.

(MORE)
64.

EDWARD (CONT'D)
We both know that you can barely
keep it going for a couple more
years before you've completely
drained it. It's a waste of capital
to keep it running when it isn't
going anywhere.

A Maitre d' comes up and stands politely next to Edward. Edward
pauses and glances at him.

EDWARD
Yes?

The Maitre d' whispers in a low voice to Edward. Edward nods and
the Maitre d' exits. Edward turns to Kross.

EDWARD
Now it's my turn to apologize. I'm
afraid that I have a private call
that I must deal with. If I may be
excused...

Without waiting to see if he's excused, Edward stands and exits.

Vivian and Kross sit quietly. Vivian eats with her usual strong
appetite. Kross seems to be pondering some dilemma. He stares at
Vivian. He knows he has been beaten, but it's difficult to take
in front of this pretty young woman.

KROSS
Your boyfriend's a_real sharpie,
little girl. A real shark. That's
the kind of man who makes it these
days. They smell money like blood.

Vivian stops eating. Kross continues, his voice full of emotion.

KROSS

There was a time when men_ got rich
by building things. I built ships
the size of cities! Ships that
could rule the seas into the next
century. Why, last year the Navy
recommissioned a ship out of
mothballs that I built forty years
ago. They did it because they knew
damn well no one could build
anything better! We built this
country into the greatest
industrial power the world has ever
known. We creamed the Japanese! We
dwarfed the rest of the world.
Dwarfed! This country sent men to
the moon!

(beat)
But something happened...

He shakes his head uncertainly.

KROSS
We made mistakes, maybe. I don't
know. We lost our way.

(MORE )
KROSS (CONT'D)

Listened to too many Harvard fags
telling us how to maximize profits.
And now men like your boyfriend,
they survive by feeding off our
decay. They make themselves rich by
sucking the money out of our
shipyards. Blind to the future.

phe re destroying everything we
uilt.

His eyes focus on Vivian. She is moved by his speech.

KROSS
But stay with him, little girl. You
don't want to be on the wrong side
of the fence when this country
falls apart. He's going to be a
good little meal ticket for you.

He is finished. Vivian stares at him, frozen.
Edward returns to the table and sits down.

EDWARD
My apologies again.

KROSS
Forget it. I have to go anyway.

EDWARD
At least stay for dinner.

KROSS
No. Thank you for this talk. You've
cleared my head. I know what to do
now.

EDWARD
Which is?

KROSS
I'm not going to pay you off. I'm
going to fight you with every
resource I have. Neither you nor
any of your cronies will ever set
foot in my shipyards. You'll burn
in hell first.

Kross stands up.

EDWARI
Alright. If you feel that way, do
what you have to do. And if you
change your mind, I won't hold it
against you later. Just tell me
that you ve changed your mind and
I'll forget about this
conversation.

KROSS
What are you rambling about?
66.

EDWARD
If you change your mind, come to
me. My door will be open.

KROSS
I'm never going to speak to you
again. I'm never going to see your
face again. I'm just going to Stop
you. Got that?

Kross tosses his napkin into his plate and leaves.

Edward leans back in his chair, calm and relaxed. He takes a sip
from his water glass. He smiles brightly at Vivian and then
laughs.

Across the table Vivian stares at him unsmiling.

VIVIAN
Why are you laughing?
EDWARD
You and your fork. You were such a
picture.
A Waiter comes up.
WAITER
Would you like the next course,
sir?
EDWARD
(brightly)
Yes. Yes, just for two.

INT. PENTHOUSE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Vivian's face is pensive as she stares out of the glass window
down at the city lights. She quickly drains her champagne glass.

Edward stands next to her. He refills her glass with the bottle
in one hand as he holds the wireless phone with his other.

EDWARD

(into phone)
We were right, they don't have any
cash. The only card he had was the
Navy contract and we know what
happened to that. It's perfect.
Kross is the only thing in our wa
and he's ready to cave in. Lots o
big talk, but one push and he's
over the edge. I could see it in
his eyes.

Edward crosses the room and sets the champagne down on a table.

EDWARD
Well, that's your job.
67.

Vivian holds her glass in a daze. Edward, full of energy, paces
back to her. He stares at her as he listens intently to the
phone.

EDWARD
Do some research. The guy used to
be a millionaire. But it's been
downhill for over twenty years. He
must be over leveraged. where’ s he
get his money these days? What
banks are loaning it to him? Find
out. We have lots of friends. It
woutdn ' t take much. A couple phone
ca. Ss.

Something catches Edward's attention. His eyes focus on Vivian's
head. He touches the diamond string wrapped around her hair bun.

EDWARD
(holding his hand over the
hone receiver)
Are those real?

Vivian shakes her head "no". Edward smiles.

EDWARD
They look lovely.

He leans over and gives her a kiss on the cheek. Back into the
phone he says:

EDWARD
Now you're thinking. Get on it

We're going to wrap this s up by
Friday now it now. 1k to you
tomorrow.

He clicks the phone off. He takes it to the table and sets it
down. He turns back toward Vivian and slowly stalks across the
room to her.

EDWARD
Have I even told you how very, very
beautiful you are?

VIVIAN
(weakly)
No.

EDWARD
You are, you know. Very beautiful.

He wraps an arm around her waist and gives her a deep kiss.
___ EDWARD
I certainly could have done a_ lot
worse for a wrong turn on Hollywood
Boulevard.

Vivian turns away from him and quickly downs her champagne.
68.

EDWARD
Easy, lover. You're supposed to sip
it.

Vivian crosses to the bottle on the table.

VIVIAN
(coolly)
I thought you liked me when I was
drunk.

She fumbles a little as she picks up the bottle. She starts to
refill the glass, spilling champagne all over. Edward pulls the
glass and bottle away from her. He sets them down on the other
end of the table. He takes Vivian by the wrists and turns her
toward him. His dark eyes peer into hers.

EDWARD
Why are you running away? You've
been acting strange all evening.

Are you mad at me?
VIVIAN
No.
EDWARD

Then kiss me again.

Vivian throws her arms around his neck and kisses him fiercely.
Edward's hands slide up her thighs and across her back. He runs
them through her hair and unties the bun. Vivian shakes her hair
out and it falls across her shoulders.

Edward gazes into her eyes. Vivian looks away. She roughly
unzips the back of her dress and pulls it from her shoulders.

Before she can get it off, Edward grabs her by the wrists again.

EDWARD
Why are you in such a hurry?

Vivian says nothing, her eyes are on the floor.

EDWARD
Am I ugly to you? Am I fat and
disgusting? Do I smell bad?

VIVIAN
(softly)
No.

EDWARD
People have been so bold as to tell
me I'm somewhat attractive. Aren't
I to you?

VIVIAN
You're very... handsome.
EDWARD
Then why are you in such a rush to
get it over with? We have all
night. Is it really such a chore?
Are you so jaded that you never
enjoy making love?

Vivian pulls away and turns her back on him.

VIVIAN
(firmly)
Not with customers.

EDWARD
Why not? I think I've been pretty
good to you the last few days.
Haven't I treated you well?

Vivian stands silently for a moment.

VIVIAN
(softly)
..-Yes.
EDWARD

I can't hear you.

69.

Edward takes her by the shoulder and spins her around. Her eyes

are full of tears.

VIVIAN
Yes!

EDWARD
Why are you crying?

Vivian says nothing. Edward shakes her gently.

EDWARD
Answer me.

VIVIAN
It's your fucking champagne. You
got me all weird inside. I drank

too much.
EDWARD
gently)
Tell me why you're crying.
VIVIAN
Leave me alone!
(desperately)

What do you want from me?!

EDWARD
My money's worth.

Another tears slides from Vivian's eyes.
70.

VIVIAN
I've given it to you.

EDWARD
No you haven't. I thought I had you
for a week, but you've only given me
a tiny part of yourself. The rest you
kee rom me. You try to hide it. But
back there in a dark corner of your
eves I can see it. Hidden away in the
shadows. And every time I see it I
wonder what it is, and why you are so
determined to keep it from me. It
makes me want you more and more. Let
me have it. Let me see it for a few
days. I promise I won't keep it.

Edward slowly takes her into his arms.
VIVIAN
I don't know what you're saying.
You don't make any sense. Just let
me go, please. Let me go.

Edward kisses her gently. Vivian is limp in his arms, tears
rolling down her neck.

EDWARD
Do you want me to make love to you?

Vivian looks into his eyes.

VIVIAN
~--YeS...

EDWARD
There. That's all I wanted.

Vivian's eyes focus upon him. She leans up and with trembling
lips she kisses his cheek.

DISSOLVE TO:
INT. LIVING ROOM - MORNING
Vivian, dressed in a white silk nightgown, sits on the carpet in
the middle of the living room. Her head is down and her hair is
a tangled mess that covers her eyes.
Edward, dressed in his usual business suit, comes from the
bedroom, struggling with his tie. He sees Vivian sitting limply
on the floor.

EDWARD
What are you doing?

VIVIAN
Just sitt'n'.
71.

EDWARD
Why don't you sit on the couch, or
go back to bed? Don't you feel

alright?

VIVIAN
I've got a little headache.

EDWARD
No wonder, the way you were
drinking last night. You want to do
my tie?

VIVIAN
Yes.

She pulls herself off the floor and walks to him. She bites her
lip as she deftly ties it into a neat knot. Edward glances at
his reflection in the plate windows to see if it is alright.

EDWARD
Hmmm. Cindy always ties it so the
emblem is right in the center of
the knot.

VIVIAN
Oh.

She reaches for him to try to re-tie it.

EDWARD
No, that's alright. I don't have
time. This will do.

Edward gives her a warm kiss. She doesn't return it. Her eyes
are glassy.

EDWARD
I hope you feel better. I'll be
one all day. Maybe we'll have
inner someplace nice tonight.

hi fully)
(hopefully)
I'd like that.

Edward smiles at her and walks away. He exits up the stairs.
Vivian watches him go.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY

Vivian, wearing her pink dress, strolls by shops in the hotel
dobby: half-heartedly window-shopping. She keeps glancing around
the lobby as if waiting for someone.

She spots Mr. Thomas coming out of a back room. She crosses the
lobby and heads for him.
72.

Mr. Thomas spots Vivian and half smiles, He isn't quite sure
what he thinks about her. Her presence in his hotel makes him
nervous, and yet he secretly enjoys her company.

VIVIAN
(cheerfully)
Hi.

MR. THOMAS
Miss Vivian.

VIVIAN
I've got to talk to you. Boy, did
ou mix me up last night with that
ine about the fork. I think I made
a fool of myself.

MR. THOMAS
(honestly concerned)
How?

VIVIAN
Oh, I didn't know which fork to use
so I kept holding off and everyone
used different ones and Edward
laughed at me.

MR. THOMAS
Oh, I'm sorry. It really isn't that
difficult.

VIVIAN
Well then show me. Edward might
take me to dinner tonight an
don't want to look like a dummy
again.

Mr. Thomas looks around the lobby uncomfortably.

MR. THOMAS
Well, I'm on duty right now. Just
use the one on the left.

VIVIAN
No, you got to_show me the whole
thing. The whole dinner thing. From
the top. You got me into this mess.

MR. THOMAS
(amused)
I...? How am I responsible?

VIVIAN
Because if you hadn't told me, I
wouldn't have even thought about
it. Now I'm all jittery.

Mr. Thomas smiles and glances around the lobby again. Everything
seems quiet enough. Why not?
73.

MR. THOMAS
Alright, come with me, young lady.
In fifteen minutes I can teach you
everything you need to know to dine
with the queen.

INT. HOTEL OFFICE - DAY

Mr. Thomas' desk is laid out with two opposing sets of
tableware. He shows Vivian the correct piece from his side and
she mirrors his actions from the other.

MR. THOMAS
And as you pick up the knife you
shift your fork to the left hand.

Vivian does this.
VIVIAN
Hey, I already knew that one. I
always do that.

MR. THOMAS
You had good parents.

VIVIAN
But the other guy ate like this.

Vivian switches the fork and knife.
MR. THOMAS

Well, he was either European or
badly brought up.

VIVIAN
No, he was a rich guy, too. I could
tell.

MR. THOMAS

That doesn't mean a thing. Some of
the richest people I've met have
the worst manners. Of course, Mr.
Harris, being of old money, knows
his way around a table.

VIVIAN
What's old money?

MR. THOMAS
That means he has inherited his
money down a long family line. It
used to be fashionable to look down
upon people who had become rich
through their own labor.

(shrugging)

In fact, it séems to be in fashion
again. But let's continue with our
lesson.

(MORE )
74.

MR. THOMAS (CONT'D)
Most restaurants don't even lay out
their silver correctly, so if they
don't it isn't your fault if you
pick up the wrong one. Spoons...

INT. BROKAGE HOUSE - DAY

Vance is punching numbers into a computer terminal as Edward and
William watch the display.

VANCE
The word's on the street. Stock's
at ten and a quarter.

Edward smiles.

EDWARD
Flight of fancy. Let's offer eight.
That should bring them back down to
earth. Then we'll raise it to nine
and close the deal.

WILLIAM

I'll work on the papers.
VANCE

So we're filing?
EDWARD

Yes, time to jump out of the

closet.
INT. MEETING ROOM - DAY
Edward and William are lounging together at the end of a long
meeting table. A lovely young Secretary comes in and serves them
coffee from a tray.

SECRETARY
How do you like it, Mr. Reaves?

WILLIAM
(suggestively)
Any way I can get it, angel.

The Secretary forces herself to smile politely.

SECRETARY
Cream or sugar?

WILLIAM
Both.

EDWARD
Black.

The Secretary pours the coffee into two cups and saucers and
lays them nearly on the table. She picks up the tray and exits.
William watches her go.

Edward takes a sip of his coffee.
75.

EDWARD
So, tell me about Kross.

William waits until the Secretary has closed the door and then
picks up his coffee.

WILLIAM
You're right, as usual. Completely
mortgaged : down to his grandson's
scholarship funds. Best of all,
he's applying for another loan.

EDWARD
Bank we know?

WILLIAM
Oh yeah.

EDWARD

Need me to call anyone?

WILLIAM
Nope. It's all handled. Nice and
quiet. You can forget all about it.

EDWARD
(sipping his coffee)
I will.

Edward changes the subject.

EDWARD
So why don't we go to dinner
tonight? You can leer at this girl
I have for the week.

WILLIAM
Is this the one whose honor you
defended from Kross?

EDWARD
(laug! ghing)
Yes. You'll like her. Just your
type. A real tramp.

INT. ELEGANT RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Edward, William, and Vivian are dining at another elegant
restaurant. Vivian is decked out in her black low-cut dress.
William stares at her cleavage as she eats daintily, holding her
silverware carefully in her hands.

EDWARD
(to Vivian)
Tell Bill what you said to me, that
first night.
(to William)
It was something like, "if you're
looking for romance you were
cruising down the wrong street.
(MORE )
76.

EDWARD (CONT'D)
But if you want to fuck, you've
found the best..."
(to Vivian)
Was that how it went?

VIVIAN
(uncomfortably)
Yeah, I think so.
William stares at Vivian fixedly.
WILLIAM
You look very familiar to me.
Haven't I seen you before?

Vivian shakes her head no.

WILLIAM
You work for Robert's agency, don't
you?
VIVIAN
No.
WILLIAM
Oh.
(to Edward)
I thought that's where you got your
girls.

EDWARD

You must be joking. I'm not going

pay a fortune for a high-class
gol igger to leech off me. Last
time I called them, I ended up
spending ten grand for a skinn
little thing that kept pressuring
me to buy her jewels. I found
Vivian on Hollywood Boulevard and
she's charging me a third of that.
And she's happy to get it, aren't
you?

Vivian meekly nods. She isn't enjoying the conversation.

WILLIAM

Jesus, Edward, you're the only |
billionaire I know who would
tramping around Hollywood loo Sng
for a bargain streetwalker. Just
because you got one bad girl
doesn't _mean you should write off
the whole agency, When you get a
girl from Robert's you're paying
or discretion.

EDWARD
What do I need discretion for? I'm
divorced. And I don't need a girl
who speaks French better than I do.
Vivian has been an absolute doll.
(MORE )
77.

EDWARD (CONT'D)

I had to buy her a few things so
that she'd Be presentable, but I'm
still going to save money in the
long run.

William shakes his head. He glances over at Vivian.

WILLIAM
Can you believe the way this guy
talks? Do you know how much he's
worth?

Vivian doesn't answer. She lowers her eyes and concentrates on
her food.

EDWARD
Why are you always pushing Robert's
on me, Bill? You own a piece of
that?

WILLIAM
(irritated)
No. It's just a nice agency and I
like to keep my clients happy. But
if you can find true love in
Hol ywood, for a great mark down,
that's okay by me.

Edward leans over to William.

EDWARD
She's a real tiger in bed.

WILLIAM
(eying her)
I'll bet she is.

Edward eats. William watches Vivian push the food around on her
plate. He seems bothered by something.

EDWARD
(amused)
What are you thinking about, Bill?

WILLIAM
(looking away)
Nothing.
EDWARD

You want her? I don't mind. You
want to try her?

WILLIAM
Jesus, Edward, don't be so tacky. I
can rent my own girls.

EDWARD
I can read you like a freeway sign.
78.

WILLIAM
(tensely)
I'm not interested.

EDWARD
Go ahead. Vivian doesn't care.
She's used to six guys a night.
Just be sure you wear a condom.
She's careful about that.

WILLIAM
Thanks, Ed. That really turns me
on. Now can we just drop it? Don't
we have anything else to talk
about?

Edward leans back in his chair and smiles smugly.

EDWARD
North American Steel.

William glares at Edward and then laughs, relaxing at last.
WILLIAM ;
No. No way. You'll never get it.
Not a prayer.

EDWARD
Why not?

Vivian stares at Edward expressionlessly.
INT. PENTHOUSE - NIGHT
Edward and Vivian come into the room. Edward switches on a
light. Vivian walks down the steps into the living room. Her
face is rigid; her eyes are focused on the floor.
Edward follows after her.
EDWARD

My, you're quiet again. You haven't

said a word to me since we left the

restaurant. I kind of like it, but...

As Edward touches her shoulder Vivian suddenly spins and
explodes with anger, pounding him with closed fists.

VIVIAN
You fucker! You fucking bastard!

Vivian frantically pounds away at Edward, not so much to hurt
him, but as if purging herself of emotion.

Edward pulls back for a moment and then forcefully grabs her
arms and throws her onto the couch.

EDWARD
Have you lost your mind?!
79.

Vivian jumps up and runs at Edward. Edward grabs her and throws
her down onto the couch. Before she can get up again Edward
pushes her back down. Tears well up in Vivian's eyes as she
yells at him.

VIVIAN
You fucking asshole. I can't
believe what a shit you are!

EDWARD
Would you please tell me what
you're mad about?

VIVIAN
I'm not a fucking piece of meat for
you to offer to your friends!

Edward is taken aback. He adopts a gentler tone. Vivian sits on

the couch,

seething with rage.

EDWARD
Alright. Just calm down.

VIVIAN
I almost picked up that fucking
table and smashed it in your
fucking face. I almost did it!

EDWARD
I appreciate your self-control.

VIVIAN
I fucking beat the shit out of a pimp
who tried to force me into his
stable. I could beat the shit out of
you! I almost started screaming in
the restaurant I was so mad. I would
have punched you in the face and
walked out of there but... but...

Vivian's voice cools to an icy calm.

VIVIAN
...I wanted my money.

EDWARD
I'm sorry. It never even occurred
to me that you would mind.
Honestly.

VIVIAN
(exploding)
I WANT MY FUCKING MONEY! I'm
getting out of here! I don't want
anything to do with you!

EDWARD
(firmly)
Lower your voice.
80.

VIVIAN
Give me my money.

EDWARD
Can we talk about this? Can you
just try to calm down?

VIVIAN

I'm going crazy 'cause you won't
let me get high. I'm bored out of
my fucking mind all day and

enever see you, you treat me
like ghitt You don't like the way I
eat. I never tie your tie right. I
don't drink enoug: and then I drink
too much. You're always shitting on
me!

A tear falls from Vivian's eyes. Edward shakes his head at her,
incredulous.

EDWARD
I'm sorry. I thought I was treating
you pretty nicely.

VIVIAN
I've fucked stinking old men who
made me want to puke, but I've
never had anyone make me feel as
dirty as you do! You make me feel
dirty inside.

EDWARD

-.. I wasn't even serious. It_was
just a joke. I was razzing Bill
ecause he runs this call girl
service. We tease each other like
that. It's quite juvenile. But I
didn't think you'd mind my
saying. - I mean it's not as if
you're from a convent.

VIVIAN
YOU DON'T OWN ME! I say when! I say
who! I say how much! If I make a
deal with you it's between me and
you and if he wants to FUCK ME TOO
then he can ask me and I'll tell
him how much!

EDWARD
Of course. You're right. I'm sorry.

VIVIAN
I don't fuck anyone who sticks
their dick out at me. I fuck who I
want! I say how much! I _run my
life! You don 't run my life!
81.

EDWARD
Vivian, I'm very sorry. You're
absolutely right. That was an
idiotic and insensitive thing I
did. I can tell that you have a lot
of pride and I should have known
that that would hurt you.

Vivian jumps to her feet.

VIVIAN
It didn't hurt me! It doesn't hurt
you when someone pisses on you! It
just pisses you off!

Edward's face sours. She is trying his patience.

EDWARD
Alright. I've apologized. I've said
I'm sorry. Now if you want to take
what you've earned so far and walk
out of here, I'll understand.

Vivian doesn't say anything.

EDWARD
Do you want me to call a cab?

Vivian is still silent.

EDWARD
Do you?

VIVIAN
I don't know.

EDWARD

Then think about it. But we're
going to get past this. I've
apologized already. I've heard what
ou have to say, you're right and
it won't happen again. But if you
can't get past it then you should
leave, because I'm only going to be
here a couple more days and I'm not
going to spend it fighting with
you. Understand?

VIVIAN
(bitterly)
Fuck off.
EDWARD

Alright. I'll call a cab. If you
want the clothes, pack them up.

Vivian stands frozen for a moment. Suddenly she spins and
marches into the bedroom.
82.

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

Vivian starts roughly picking up her clothes in the dim light of
the bedroom. As she does she starts cry ying. With each item of
clothing the tears come down harder. Finally she is crying so
hard she can't breathe. She lets the clothes fall from her arms
and starts to shake uncontrollably.

Edward appears at the doorway. His face is genuinely concerned.
Vivian sobs in fits, gasping for air.

EDWARD
(tenderly)
I'm sorry. I really am sorry.

Vivian finally manages to breathe again. She stands limply. Her
face is smeared black with mascara.

VIVIAN
You...
(barely audible)
.--hurt me.

Edward goes to her and wraps his arms around her shoulders. She
touches his hand.

INT. BATHTUB - NIGHT

Edward and Vivian are taking a bath together. It isn't a bubble
bath. Edward wipes the black mascara from Vivian's eyes with his
wet hands.

EDWARD
I've been a fiendish cad, and I'll
make it up to you.

VIVIAN
I got so crazy. I'm not like that.
I don't know why I got so crazy.

EDWARD
(exaggerating his Harvard
accent)
Because I was a boor, a clod, an
oaf, a cretin, a dunce, a putz, a
shmuck..

He washes the black from his hands and caresses her cheeks again
with warm water.

EDWARD
...but I shall make amends as only
a Harris can.

He runs his little finger across he eyebrows and down her nose.
EDWARD

I shall give you an experience that
will last a lifetime.
83.

Vivian smiles.

VIVIAN
Yeah, sure. You're good, lover, but
not that good

EDWARD
Vivian, Hoe. mind is always in the
utter. Mine's only there
requently. I speak not of the
lower forms of pleasure, but of
high art.

VIVIAN
What?

EDWARD
I'm going to take you to the opera.

EXT. FANCY CLOTHING STORE ON RODEO DRIVE - DAY

Edward is holding Vivian by the hand as they stand in front of a
display window. Inside the window is a stunning red sequined
ress.

EDWARD
That's it. That's what you're
wearing tonight.

Vivian's eyes light up like a child on Christmas morning.
INT. CLOTHING STORE - DAY

Edward sits on a comfortable chair sipping tea as he waits by
the dressing room. A prim, well-dressed Saleswoman stands at
attention by his side.

Vivian comes out of the dressing room wearing the red dress. She
looks beautiful in it. Her face is aglow with pleasure as she
admires herself in the mirror. The Saleswoman walks over to her
and checks the fit.

SALESWOMAN
It'll need a couple alterations to
fit right in the bust. We can do
them here.

EDWARD
We need them done now. I'm taking
her to Aida in San Francisco
tonight.

The Saleswoman purrs in Vivian's ear.
SALESWOMAN

Oh, you're so lucky. It's supposed
to’be fabulous.
84.

INT. MERCEDES - DAY

Edward is talking on his car phone. Vivian sits happily next to
him, admiring her new dress.

EDWARD

(into the phone)
Bill, Bill, stop panicking. I'll
read the contracts on the plane.
Just have the brokerage arrange the
flights for me. Kross isn't going
anywhere. It's not like I'm going
to help anything by watching the
stock go down today. Have it ready
for me. I'll make a couple more
stops and be there in an hour or
two. ‘Bye.

Vivian looks over at Edward, still reeling from all the
attention he is giving her.

VIVIAN
Are you sure this is alright? I
don't want you to hurt your
business.

Edward smiles amusedly.

EDWARD
My empire may. crumble through |
neglect, but it's worth it. I've
been meaning to see Aida before it
closes and now I have a good
excuse. But you must be freezing in
that skimpy thing.

VIVIAN
I'm okay.

EDWARD
No, no. You're bound to get
pneumonia if we don't do something.

INT. FURRIER - DAY

Vivian stands wrapped up in a gray mink coat. She rubs the fur
against her cheek in ecstasy. Edward sits near her, watching.

VIVIAN
It's so soft.

A handsome young Salesman is standing by her side, his arms
filled with other coats. He looks at Edward for approval.

EDWARD
Nice, but not what I had in mind.
We're only going to rent it for a
few days, so we might as well get
something really special.
85.

SALESMAN
I have just the thing.

He exits into the other room. Vivian looks at Edward pleadingly.

VIVIAN
I like this one.

EDWARD
Vivian, trust me, I know furs. I'm
going to find you one that will
give you multiple orgasms.

The Salesman comes out carrying a long, stark white fur coat.
Vivian's eyes widen. The Salesman hands it to Edward.

SALESMAN
Baby seal, very rare. You can't get
them anywhere any more. I normally
wouldn't even consider renting it, but
for you, Mr. Harris...

Edward nods. He stands up and walks to Vivian's side. The
Salesman helps Vivian out of the mink and steps back. Edward
slides the coat over Vivian's arms. He wraps it around her body
and gives her a kiss. Vivian melts.

VIVIAN
(whispering in Edward's
ear)

I think I'm coming.

SALESMAN
(loudly)
Of course, 1f you do decide to
purchase it later, I'll deduct the
rental fees from the total cost.

Edward glances at the Salesman sideways.
EDWARD

Don't get your hopes up. Frank.

We're just renting it for the

opera.
INT. SHOE STORE - DAY
Another Salesman is fitting Vivian with a pair of red high heel
shoes. Edward sits next to her. He leans over and whispers in
her ear.

EDWARD
Feel like Cinderella yet?

Vivian nods happily.
INT. BROKERAGE - NIGHT

Edward, dashing in a tuxedo, escorts Vivian by the hand down a
long hallway as William trails after them.
86.

Vivian, balancing on high heels, is having trouble keeping up
with him on the slippery marble floors.

WILLIAM
Please, at least think about it.
It's a gold mine. You're the one
who thought it up.

EDWARD
Bill, I don't want to get in the
toxic waste business. What a
nightmare! I just want to sell the
rights to the highest bidder. Let
them do the dirty work. Those
rocessing licenses must be worth a
ortune.

WILLIAM
But not half as much as if we use
them ourselves.
Edward stops suddenly and turns toward William. Vivian skids and
almost falls; she grabs Edward's shoulder for balance. Edward,
ignoring her, looks down at William like a teacher lecturing a
ow student.
EDWARD
Bill. Cash, leverage, acquire.
Cash, leverage, acquire, Cash,
Teverage, acquire. Got it?

WILLIAM
Okay, okay. I got it.

Edward slaps William on the shoulder and drags Vivian off.

WILLIAM
Enjoy the opera! Read the
contracts!
EXT. HELIPORT - DAY

Vivian and Edward come out onto the roof and make their way to a
waiting helicopter.

Once they are inside, the helicopter takes off.
INT. HELICOPTER - DAY

Vivian looks out the window as the chopper flies over the city.
She squeezes Edward's hand.

VIVIAN
It's like a dream.

Edward smiles absently as he reads through some papers.
EXT. HELIPORT AT BURBANK AIRPORT - DAY

Edward and Vivian climb out of the helicopter and make their way
from the landing pad.
87.

A Pilot in a leather jacket and dark sunglasses greets them.

PILOT
Mr. Harris?

EDWARD
Yes.

PILOT

Your plane is ready to go, sir.
EXT. HELIPORT AT BURBANK AIRPORT - DAY
A small corporate jet takes off down the landing strip.
INT. JET - DAY

Edward and Vivian are alone in the passenger lounge of the jet.
It is a comfortable room featuring a long couch that curves
across two walls, a small bar, anda pusite -in television and
stereo. Edward is sorting through a pile of contracts. Vivian is
ooking at herself in a small mirror. He hair is wild and loose
from the helicopter.

VIVIAN
Good thing I didn't have my hair
done.

EDWARD
Oh, I should have warned you. Cindy
won't even let me get her near a
helicopter.

VIVIAN
I can fix it.

EDWARD
Good, now be quiet while I read
these.

Vivian smiles wickedly and fluffs her hair up. She takes her fur
off and lays it down on the floor. She walks over to Edward and
slides into his lap. She starts to kiss his neck.

Edward, grinning, pushes her away gently.

EDWARD
Go away.

Vivian, undaunted, slides the straps of her dress off her
shoulders. She stands and it falls to the floor. Wearing only a
pair of red panties, she lies down on the fur coat.

EDWARD
What are you doing?

Vivian gives Edward her finest come-hither look.

VIVIAN
Being quiet.
88.

Edward sets down his papers.
EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - SUNSET

The sun is just beginning to set as the jet makes a slow pass
over the city and heads for the airport.

INT. JET - SUNSET

Vivian, naked, stares out the window at the city lights
twinkling below. Her eyes are full of wonder.

VIVIAN
I can see the bridge. It's all lit
up. It's so beautiful.

Edward is reading a contract. Without glancing up he speaks to
her.

EDWARD
You'd better put on your clothes,
now. I don't want to give the pilot
a thrill.

Vivian reaches down and picks up her red dress.
EXT. SAN FRANCISCO OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT

An airport limo pulls to a stop in front of the San Francisco
Opera House. The driver walks around back and opens the
passenger door. Edward emerges and helps the fur-wrapped Vivian
out.

They walk toward the Opera House past a beautifully lit fountain
wit several graceful statues in its center. Edward has his hand
on Vivian's elbow as they talk.

EDWARD

Some people say that Opera isa
cultivated taste -- that's why
everyone prefers movies -- but I
don't believe that. It's something
you're born to. But I don't mean
that in an elitist sense. High
born, low born, you can always tell
when someone goes to the opera for
the first time. Some love it, some
hate it. Those who love it will
always love it; those who hate it
might force themselves to
appreciate it, but they' 11 never
love it. Maybe there’ s an opera
ene in a person's DNA. It'll be
interesting to see how you react.

VIVIAN
Even if I hate it, I'm glad you
took me.
89.

EDWARD
So am I.

INT. OPERA LOBBY - NIGHT

A small crowd of well-dressed people move through the lobby
toward the theater. Vivian admires the pretty dresses and things
aroun: er.

INT. THEATER - NIGHT

Edward and Vivian sit front row center on the first balcony.
They hold programs while they wait for the curtain. Vivian leans
over to Edward and speaks in a low voice.

VIVIAN
If it's in Italian, how will I know
what they're saying?

EDWARD
I'll whisper some of the main parts
of the story for you. But you'll be
surprised at how much you'll
understand by the way they sing.
The music conveys their emotions
more powerfully than any words.

The orchestra begins.
MONTAGE OF OPERA

When the lights dim and the opera is performed, we do not shift
to the stage but rather stay on Vivian.

As the music builds and the changing stage lights dance across
her face we see the opera unfold only through her eyes. As we
DISSOLVE from close-up to close-up, Edward occasionally leans
over and whispers intimately into her ear.

EDWARD
Radames is desperately in love with
Aida, a mere slave. Yet he is
forced to marry Amneris, the King's
daughter.

The music continues. Vivian's face focuses intensely on the
stage, as if a new world is being revealed to her. Edward leans
toward her ear.

EDWARD
Here he tells Aida how much he
loves her but...

Vivian raises a hand and gently covers Edward's mouth. She nods,
eyes fixed on the stage. She understands what is happening.

As Vivian's hand slowly lowers, Edward glances at her, pleased.
He holds onto her hand and gently strokes her fingers.
90.

Vivian concentrates on what is happening. The music is reaching
its tragic climax. The emotions building inside Vivian swell. As
the opera ends, she is profoundly moved. A single tear rolls
down her cheek.

INT. STAIRCASE / OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT

Vivian and Edward stand at the top of an elegant staircase
leading down from the balcony. Vivian is slightly swaying as if
weak. Edward has a firm arm around her shoulder.

EDWARD
Are you alright? Can you make it
down the stairs?

VIVIAN
I just stood up too fast. My head
is spinning. The blood all went to
my legs. Just a second.

Edward holds her tightly as_ other patrons move past them and
down the stairs. Edward smiles smugly at her.

EDWARD
You liked the opera, didn't you?

Vivian nods.

VIVIAN
Yeah. It was... I liked it so much.
It... was sad.

As she thinks about it, she feels the urge to cry again. She
fights it.

VIVIAN
I'm okay now.

INT. AIRPLANE - NIGHT

Vivian is lying across the lounge couch with her head on
Edward's lap. Edward strokes her hair. Tears are streaming from
er eyes.

EDWARD
You're such an emotional little
creature.

VIVIAN
(defensively)
It was sad.

EDWARD
I know. But I took you to make you
happy, not to make you cry.

VIVIAN
I'm happy. Just sad happy is all.
91.

EDWARD
You've been crying for an hour.

Vivian wipes her eyes.

VIVIAN
I just... I'm kinda used to smoking
whenever I get sad, you_know? It
keeps me feeling goo I'm not used
to being off it.

EDWARD
I'm sorry if that's been tough on
you.

VIVIAN

No, no. It's okay. It's just like
I'm feeling all sorts of strange
things. s kinda nice in a way. I
just Raves trouble handling it
sometimes.

EDWARD
Well, the day after tomorrow I'm
off to New York and you can do
whatever you want. And youll have
some money to do it wit

VIVIAN
Yeah.

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

Edward is sound asleep. Vivian is staring off into the darkness.
She can't sleep.

She slowly crawls out of bed. She is wearing a pink teddy.
Edward stirs. He blinks his eyes.

EDWARD
What's the matter?
VIVIAN
Noth'n'. Just can't sleep.
EDWARD
Oh.
VIVIAN

Can I get some champagne? Maybe
it'll Relp me sleep.

EDWARD
Sure. Let me call ...

He pulls himself up with difficulty.
VIVIAN

No, no. I can call. You sleep. I'm
alright. Really.
92.

Edward lies back down.

EDWARD
(sleepily)
Okay. Order whatever you want.

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Vivian sits alone on the living room floor staring out the
windows into the city. She is dressed in_her pink teddy with the
white fur wrapped around her shoulders. She sips straight from
the bottle of champagne.

She hums a tune from the opera.

She takes a long drink and arranges the bottom of the fur over
her legs for warmth.

INT. LIVING ROOM - MORNING

Edward is dressed in his robe talking on the phone as he looks
over the morning breakfast on the dining table.

EDWARD
Jesus that was fast. What did ygu
do, put a horse head in his bed?

INT. BROKERAGE HOUSE - MORNING
A Secretary hands William a cup of coffee. He takes a sip.

WILLIAM

Very funny. I barely did anything.
The old coot must be more desperate
than either of us thought. He said
he wouldn't talk to me about
specifics until after our thirty-

day filing period. But he wants to

k to you. Get assurances that
you" re both on the same side or
Something. Maybe get you to call
off the dogs, i.e., me.

He takes another sip of his coffee. He waves the Secretary off.
She exits.

WILLIAM
An Anyhow I told him that I might be
e to arrange for you to see him
this morning at your hotel room.
What I'd Like you to do is butter
him up and then drag him here so I
can grill him.

INT. LIVING ROOM - MORNING
Edward is sipping orange juice.

EDWARD
You're such a sneaky fucker.
93.

WILLIAM
The guy's pathetic. All you have to
do is take him by the hand and
bring | him over. If we could just
get him to tell us the story on the
Na nee? air commitments it would be
wor 1

Edward glances at his watch.

EDWARD
Alright. Tell him ten-thirty.

WILLIAM
He'll be there.

INT. BEDROOM —- MORNING

Vivian is passed out on the bed. Edward comes in and undoes his
robe. He starts to put on a suit.

EDWARD
Wake up, sleeping beauty.

Vivian stirs. She blinks and looks at Edward with sleepy red
eyes.

VIVIAN
What?

EDWARD
Put on some clothes. We're going to
have a guest.

INT. BEDROOM - DAY
Vivian, wearing her yellow dress, is tying Edward's tie for him.
EDWARD
You sure you don't mind? I wouldn't
want you to get mad at me again.
VIVIAN ;
No, it's okay. I didn't mean it. I
like tying it.
She finishes. Edward checks it in the mirror.
EDWARD
Pattern in the center. Perfect.
That's lovely.

He gives her a peck on the cheek. We hear the doorbell ring from
the living room.

EDWARD
Well, here we go.
94.

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

Vivian stands near the bedroom as Edward opens the front door.
Mr. Kross slowly enters. He looks old and tired. The shake hands
and Edward closes the door behind him.

EDWARD
Mr. Kross.

KROSS
Mr. Harris.

Edward leads him down the stairs.

EDWARD
Have a seat.

KROSS
I can't stay very long.

Kross notices Vivian standing across the room. He seems
surprised to see her. Surprised and bothered. He nods to her.

KROSS
Young lady.

. VIVIAN
Hl.

They both seem uncomfortable in each other's presence. Like
former lovers who run into each other by surprise in public.
Kross immediately turns his eyes away from her. He looks at
Edward.

KROSS
I'll get to the point. As I said
earlier today to your lawyer, I've
reconsidered my position on your
expected acquisition offer. After
the filing period is over, I'll
recommend to the board that we
accept your bid.

EDWARD
Excellent. I'm sure that will be
the best for everyone.

KROSS
And I wanted to apologize for...

EDWARD
There is nothing for you to
apologize for. It's just business.

Kross's hands are trembling. He glances nervously at Vivian and
then back at Edward.

__ KROSS
Yes. Business.
95.

Vivian is disturbed watching this broken man. She backs away
into the bedroom and disappears.

KROSS
That's all. I just wanted to tell
you my decision in person.

EDWARD
I appreciate that. And I'm sure
things will go well for you.

KROSS
Thank you. I'd better be going.

EDWARD
Perhaps you could do me one favor,
thoug If you could take an hour
to accompany me down to m
brokerage and have a brief talk
with my lawyer. Just answer a
couple questions.

KROSS
I don't think that's quite proper
at_this time. Maybe after the
filing period.

EDWARD

Let me be completely up front with
your Mr. Kross. We're preparing our
id now. That bid is based on our
speculation of the corporation's net
worth. The more we know the higher
our bid can be. And since you do own
a large block of shares...

__ KROSS ;
...-It's in my best interest to
cooperate.

EDWARD
We might even be able to strike a
special deal with you on your
particular block of shares.

Kross looks at Edward with a weak smile.
KROSS
And if I throw myself on m yor,
ou promise to take care o
amily.
Edward stares at Kross evenly.

EDWARD
It doesn't have to be that way.

KROSS
Alright. I'll answer your
questions. Whatever you want.
96.

EDWARD
Good.
(turning)
Vivian...

Edward notices for the first time that Vivian has left the room.

EDWARD
Just one second.

He heads to the bedroom.
INT. BEDROOM - DAY

Vivian is sitting on the bed as Edward comes in. He closes the
door behind him.

EDWARD
Why'd you run off?

Vivian stares at her feet.

VIVIAN
Just... no reason.

EDWARD
Very well. I'm going to be gone all
day. I don't think I'1l be back in
time for dinner so go ahead and
eat. Alright?

Vivian looks up at Edward.

VIVIAN
What did you do to him?

EDWARD
What do you mean?

VIVIAN
Why is he afraid of you? What did
you do to him?

Edward is silent for a long while. He doesn't like this question.

EDWARD
I don't think you need to worry
about things like that.

VIVIAN
(almost to herself)
Last time I saw him he was so
strong. Now he's so scared.

EDWARD
(firmly)
The man made a business decision.
That's all. I make business
decisions; you make business
decisions.
(MORE)
97.

EDWARD (CONT'D)
Nobody does anything unless it's in
his own best interest.

Vivian stares at her feet and says nothing. Edward watches her.
He turns and leaves.

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
Edward crosses the living room to Kross.

EDWARD
Everything's fine. Let's go.

EXT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL - DAY

It's a cold cloudy day. Vivian stands in front of the hotel in
her mink coat, smoking a cigarette. She watches the cars passing
by, thinking.

An old yellow Mustang passes. She takes a last drag and tosses
her cigarette butt into the gutter.

She turns and goes back into the hotel.
INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY
Vivian walks up to the front desk and addresses the Desk Clerk.
VIVIAN
Is there a phone I can use? I want

to call a cab.

DESK CLERK
You may use this phone.

He pulls a phone from under the desk.
Mr. Thomas enters from the back door. He smiles at Vivian.

MR. THOMAS
Miss Vivian.

VIVIAN
Hi. What's the number of a cab
company?

MR. THOMAS
Where are you going?

VIVIAN
Ummm... Hollywood like. I need to
get some medicine. You know, for
headaches.

MR. THOMAS
Why don't you use one of the
hotel's limousines?

VIVIAN
Limo?
98.

MR. THOMAS
Of course. A small perk for the
guests in our better rooms.

Vivian thinks about that for a moment. She kind of likes the
idea, but it also makes her nervous.

VIVIAN
Ummm... I don't want Edward to know
I'm leaving. He... I just don't
want...

MR. THOMAS

Discretion is our middle name here
at the Beverly Wilshire.

EXT. LIMO - DAY
A long black limo drives into Hollywood.
INT. LIMO - DAY

Vivian sits alone in the back of the limo, enjoying the ride.
There is a phone and a tiny television set and a small stereo
system. She examines each carefully and plays with the knobs.

LIMO DRIVER (0.S.)
(from a small speaker)
Is this the street, Ma'am?

Vivian presses the intercom button.

VIVIAN
Yes. 1312. It's a big apartment
building.

EXT. VIVIAN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

The limo pulls to a stop in front of a rundown apartment
building on a dirty Hollywood side street.

The Limo Driver, a large Latino man, steps out of the car and
walks around to the passenger door. As he does he surveys the
surroundings uncomfortably. This is a rough neighborhood.

He opens the door. Vivian steps out, fur and all.

LIMO DRIVER
Are you sure this is the right
place, Ma'am?

VIVIAN
Yeah.

LIMO DRIVER
Maybe I should go with you. This
doesn't look like a good place for
a lady to be alone.
99.

Vivian is suddenly aware of how her appearance has changed. She
wraps the fur around herself a little nervously.

VIVIAN
I'll be okay. I'll just be a
second.

LIMO DRIVER
You sure, Ma'am?

VIVIAN
Yeah.

She hurries up the steps to the apartment building. The Limo
Driver unhappily watches her go.

INT. HALLWAY - DAY

Vivian's bright new shoes and white fur traverse the grimy dark
car eted hallways. Cockroaches scurry along the edges of the
wa Ss.

Vivian reaches the door to her apartment. She turns the knob. It
opens.

INT. VIVIAN'S APARTMENT - DAY

Vivian's apartment is small and claustrophobic. The walls are a
dingy faded yellow, and plaster is falling from the ceiling.
There are a couple of worn-out overstuffed chairs and a bookcase
piled with everything but books. The majority of the room is
given over to a jarge bed that is folded out of a couch. A large
mangy pile of old blankets and pillows covers it.

As Vivian enters from the hallway she whispers.

VIVIAN
Kit? Kit? You here?

She blinks into the dim room and waits for an answer. There is
none. It is clear from Vivian's face that she is glad no one is
home. She closes the door behind herself.

She moves to a small wooden box on the bookshelf and opens it.
Inside are various drug paraphernalia, but no drugs. She closes
it, annoyed.

KIT
Viv?

Startled, Vivian spins and sees Kit staring at her from under
the blankets on the bed. Her face is pale and ghostly. Her voice
hoarse.

VIVIAN
Jesus, you scared me. I didn't see
you under there. Why didn't you
answer me?
100.

KIT
I was waking up. I'm not feeling
too good

VIVIAN

You never feel good.

KIT
That's a pretty coat. Did your date
give you that coat?

VIVIAN
No, it's just rented.

KIT
Those are pretty shoes.

VIVIAN
Yeah. Well, I can't stay very long.
I got to go back.

KIT
You aren't home yet?

VIVIAN .
No, not 'til tomorrow. I just
wanted some rock. Is there any?

KIT
No. I smoked it all. But we could
go get some if you have money.

Kit sits up. She wears a sleeveless undershirt that exposes her
unhealthily thin and pale arms. Vivian stares at her unhappily.

VIVIAN
Fuck, you look like hell. Haven't
you been eating?

KIT
I didn't have any money.

VIVIAN
You have to work, babe. Besides,
there's food in the kitchen.
Kit coughs hard.
KIT
I didn't feel like it. I just
haven't been hungry.
VIVIAN
You have to eat. No wonder you
don't feel good. God damn it.
Vivian stands restlessly, overcome with both guilt and revulsion.

VIVIAN
You're such a fucking baby.
101.

She pulls off her coat and tosses it onto a chair. She marches
into the kitchen alcove.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Vivian's kitchen is piled with dirty dishes, old open cans and
various food boxes. Vivian pours a can of chicken soup into a
small saucepan on a tiny electric skillet.

KIT (0.S.)
What you doing, Viv?

VIVIAN
I'm making you some soup, damn it.
You have to eat. You want onions in
it?

KIT (0.8.
I'd like that.

Vivian gets a small white onion from the refrigerator and chops
it with a large butcher knife. She throws the onion into the
soup.

INT. VIVIAN'S APARTMENT - DAY

Vivian comes out with a bowl of hot soup with a spoon in it. As
she stands in front of Kit for a moment we almost get the
impression that she might throw it at her. Instead, she sets it
down roughly on the be

Kit starts to sip the soup. Vivian paces around the room
restlessly. She moves to the window and opens it.

VIVIAN
God it stinks in here. Why didn't
you open the window?

KIT
It's cold.

Kit sips the soup.

KIT
This is good. I'm feeling better
already.

VIVIAN
I'm not your fucking mother.

KIT
I'm sorry. I've just felt lonely.
You want to go get some rock?

VIVIAN
No, I got to go. I've got a car
waiting for me. I shouldn't smoke
it anyway while I'm working.
102.

KIT
You sure look pretty. That guy must
be treating you real good. Is he
nice?

VIVIAN
He's alright.

KIT
He must like you a lot to want you
around for so long. He sure must

like you.
VIVIAN

Yeah... well, he likes to fuck me.
KIT

He buys you nice things.
VIVIAN

Yeah.

Kit coughs again.

KIT

Maybe you should stay with him, Viv.
VIVIAN

(nervously)

What are you, nuts? The guy's rich.
Don't you know anything? He can
have any girl he wants. He has a
high-class fuck in New York. Rich
guys don't go for street girls.

KIT
Why'd he pick you up?
VIVIAN
It was a mistake.
(softly)
He was lost. He just wants me 'til

tomorrow.

Maybe he' it Task you to stay with
him.

Vivian doesn't like to think about that. She turns away.

VIVIAN
No.

KIT
Don't worry about me, Viv. I'll be
okay. I can always get by. You
should stay with him. You look so
pretty. et if you asked him he'd
want to keep you.
103.

VIVIAN
God are you stupid. He's just a
date. That's all.
(beat)
I got to go.

She grabs her coat and puts it on. She walks to the door and
stands for a moment, uncomfortable, guilty. She pulls some money
out of her coat pocket.

VIVIAN

Here's twenty. Hell, forty. Don't
spend it all on rock. Get some food
tonight, okay? You're gonna get
sick if you don't keep eating.

(beat)
I... don't know exactly what time
I'll be back tomorrow, so don't
wait for me or anything.

She sets two twenty-dollar_ bills on the bookcase. Kit and Vivian
stare at each other silently for a moment. In Vivian's hand is
the rest of her money. She looks down at it.

VIVIAN
Yeah. And... I'm gonna stash some
of this here. I got it the first
night with him.

She opens an empty jar of cold cream and stashes most of the
money inside.

VIVIAN
Don't you touch that money... I'll
count it when I get back...

Vivian walks to the door and hesitates again. Kit looks at her
sadly.

KIT
You're not coming back, are you?

Vivian tries to say something but chokes on the words. She takes
a deep breath.

VIVIAN
I'll be back, babe.
(pause)
You_know what? When I get back
we'll go to Disneyland. Take a bus.
Would you like that? I'll have lots
of money.

KIT
That would be fun.

VIVIAN
We'll go on that Space Mountain
ride. You like that?
104.

KIT
I like Small World with all the
kids and the little boats.

VIVIAN
We'll go on everything. It'll be
fun.
Vivian opens the door and slowly steps out.
KIT
I think you should stay with him,
Viv.
Vivian grits her teeth.
VIVIAN
You're so fucking stupid! Just shut
up! I'll be back tomorrow.
She exits and closes the door behind herself.
EXT. VIVIAN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

Vivian comes quickly out of the apartment building and heads for
the limo. The Limo Driver opens the door for her.

LIMO DRIVER
I was getting worried.

VIVIAN
I'm fine. Just take me back.

INT. LIMO - DAY

Vivian sits in the back of the limo. She is calmer now. She
leans back in the seat and wraps the fur tightly around herself.

INT. BROKERAGE HOUSE - DAY

Edward and William stand in front of a conference table staring
at a long flow chart of their acquisition and liquidation of
Kross Enterprises.

WILLIAM
Well, that's about it. Thirty,
sixty days. Six months. One year.
After that, Kross is just naval
history.

EDWARD
You really think we can scam all
the pension funds off on P.B.G.?

WILLIAM
Hey, '78 was a great year.

He starts to roll up the charts.
105.

WILLIAM
The only question in my mind is
what are you going to go after
next.

EDWARD
(smugly)
North Américan Steel...

WILLIAM
You're dreaming.

Jake comes into the room.

JAKE
Your helicopter's ready, Mr.
Harris.

WILLIAM

(glancing sideways Edward)
Helicopter? Going to the opera
again?

. EDWARD
I just want another look at the
shipyards before I go back to New
York.

WILLIAM
You're such a sentimental softy.

EDWARD .
Why don't you come with me?

WILLIAM
No. I want to finish that chemical
bid so you can take it back to New

York.
EDWARD /

You can always Fed Ex it later.
WILLIAM

No, you know me. I don't like loose

ends.
INT. BROKERAGE HALLWAY - DAY

Jake is escorting Edward down the hallway.

JAKE
So, did you learn a lot from Mr.
Kross?

EDWARD

Who? Oh, no. Not really. We already
knew it all.
106.

EXT. HELICOPTER - DAY

Edward is sitting comfortably in the helicopter as it passes
over the decaying shipyards. He stares down at it thoughtfully.

INT. LIVING ROOM - EVENING

Vivian is standing in front of the glass windows, looking out at
the city, drinking a glass of champagne. The doorbell rings.
Startled, she spills some champagne on her hand. She turns and
looks at the door, edgy. It rings again.

Licking the champagne from her hand, she walks across the room
and up the stairs to the door. She opens it.

William is standing outside with a small briefcase.

_ WILLIAM
Hello again.
VIVIAN
(nervously)
Hi.
WILLIAM

I take it Edward isn't back from
his little helicopter trip?

VIVIAN
No.

They wait quietly for a moment, Vivian expecting him to leave
and William standing firm.

WILLIAM
May I come in?

VIVIAN
Oh, yeah, sure.

William walks past her and down the steps into the living room.
He spots the open bottle of champagne and walks over to it.

WILLIAM
You like drinking alone?

VIVIAN
Sometimes.

William picks up a glass.

WILLIAM
Do you mind?

Vivian is obviously uncomfortable in his presence, but she
doesn't feel like she can refuse.

VIVIAN
No.
107.

William sets his briefcase down on the table and pours a full
glass. He takes a sip.

WILLIAM
It's been a long day.
(pause)
You know Edward's leaving tomorrow,
don't you?

WILLIAM
Yeah.

William takes another sip. He opens his briefcase and takes out
a small stack of papers.

WILLIAM
m going to leave some papers here
for im to take back to New York.

He sets the papers down on the table and closes the briefcase.
He walks over to the window and looks out. He takes another sip.

WILLIAM
Great view. Lord Harris sure knows
how to live, doesn't he?

VIVIAN
Lord Harris?

WILLIAM
Just a joke. Between me and Ed.
This must be quite _a change for a
hooker off thé boulevard.

Vivian says nothing. William takes a long drink and goes back to
the bottle for a refill. He stares at Vivian.

WILLIAM
You're a very pretty girl, Vivian.
Too pretty for the street.

Vivian is silent. William stalks closer to her. He takes a
drink.

WILLIAM
What do you make a week? Five
hundred? Even that?

Vivian's tone of voice suddenly becomes hostile.

VIVIAN
What's it to you?

WILLIAM
With the right manager you could
make a lot of money. More than
Edward's giving you. Much more than
you can make on the street.
108.

VIVIAN
I don't like managers. I don't like
people making money off me.

William smiles.

WILLIAM
You _got a mean streak in you. Don't
you? Maybe that's what Edward liked
about you.

He takes a sip and turns away.

WILLIAM

There's nothing to get hostile
about. I have some friends who run
a nice service. They aren't like
the pimps you find on the street.
They don't muscle you. They just
help you. Sure, they take a cut,
but since you're making a lot more
money you won't even think about

VIVIAN

Yeah, they take their cut. Then they
sell you their shitty overpriced
dope. Then they rent you their
laces... they let you use one of
heir cars. Then they tell you they
need a bigger cut, and the dope costs
more, too. But don't worry, they'll
lend you the money ‘til your next
job. Yeah, they'll help you. They'll
elp fuck you. Well, no thanks. I
only want to get fucked by one person
at a time.

William's face sours. He downs his champagne quickly and sets
the glass down on the table. Obviously straining to keep his
voice calm, he turns to Vivian.

WILLIAM
How long have you been on the
street, Vivian?

VIVIAN
(quietly)
Six years.

WILLIAM
I read in the paper once that the
average life expectancy for a
street hooker was twenty-seven.

VIVIAN
I don't read the paper.
109.

WILLIAM
Don't you like it here? You got
your champagne, you nice Rodeo
Drive dresses, your view. Isn't
this nice?

Vivian says nothing. She turns away from him.

WILLIAM
What are you, going to do when
Edward's finished with you? Go back
to the street? You're too pretty
for that. You're just wasting
yourself. A couple of years fucking
niggers and drug pushers and your
face will be ruined.

VIVIAN
Just get out here.
(desperately)
Does Edward want you here? I don't
think he'd like it if you were
talking to me like this.

William half laughs.

WILLIAM
Edward? Oh, now I get it. It's
starting to make sense. You don't
think Edward's going to get rid of
you, do you? What do you think? You
think Edward's going to keep you?
(intensely)

Don't you know what a cold bastard
he is? He's not going to keep you.

VIVIAN
(yelling)
I know!

WILLIAM
(angrily)
Then what's your problem? I'm
trying to help you!

Vivian spins and stares at him furiously.
VIVIAN
I don't want your help! I don't
like you. I'd rather fuck niggers
and drug pushers than fuck you!

William slaps her hard across the face.

WILLIAM
Don't talk to me like that, whore.

Vivian buckles over, holding her face in pain. William stares at
her, seething.
110.

WILLIAM
Fine. Go back to the street. End up
dead in a dumpster. What do I care?

He turns to start to leave, but as he does Vivian leaps at him,
pounding him from behind.

William turns and slaps her hard again. He slaps her again.
Vivian keeps punching him.

VIVIAN
You fucker! You fucker!

In the background, Edward opens the door and enters the room. He
sees the two of them fighting. For a moment he is confused, but
then he hurries down the steps and runs to them.

EDWARD
Cut it out! What's going on?!

Vivian roughly claws William with her fingernails. Edward pulls
her away from him.

William, blood dripping from his cheek, lunges at her and slaps
her again.

Edward punches William hard in the stomach. William buckles over
in pain.

Edward pulls Vivian further away and lets go of her.

As Edward moves toward William, William straightens with an
angry look on his face.

WILLIAM
That little bitch!

William is about to rush toward Vivian again when Edward slugs
him square on the chin. William stops cold and sways in dizzied
pain.

Edward grabs him ‘ey the shoulder and drags him up the steps to
the front door. liam, dazed, doesn't resist.

Edward tosses him out into the hallway. He follows him and
closes the door.

Vivian stands alone, stunned, holding her face in pain.
INT. HALLWAY - DAY
Edward roughly throws William up against the wall.

EDWARD
What the fuck are you doing?

William grits his teeth.
111.

WILLIAM
That's some nasty little cunt you
found.

EDWARD

Yeah, I kind of like her. What the
fuck were you doing with her?

WILLIAM
I came to drop off some papers and
she started pissing me o

EDWARD

What? Did you make a pass at her?
WILLIAM

No.
EDWARD

Well, whatever it was, you look
pretty stupid.

He takes William by the chin and turns his head so that he can
see the cuts from Vivian's nails.

WILLIAM
Yeah, I feel pretty stupid. Nice
right hook you got.

Edward smiles and pats William on the shoulder.

EDWARD
So, what'd you bring me?

WILLIAM
The treatment license bid. Try to
read it by next week.

EDWARD
I'd invite you in for a drink, but
I don't think it would be a good

idea.
WILLIAM
No. That's alright.
(grinning)

I got to go get a tetanus shot.
He wipes the blood from his face with a handkerchief.
WILLIAM
Oh, I need my briefcase, if you
would be so kind...
Edward opens the doors and goes back into the room.
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Edward comes down the steps and crosses to the dining table. He
grabs William's briefcase.
112.

Vivian is sitting on the couch, unmoving.

Edward walks up the steps and tosses the briefcase out to
William.

WILLIAM
Have a nice trip tomorrow.

EDWARD
I will.

Edward closes the doors. He turns and looks at Vivian. She seems
frozen. Edward walks up to the couch and sits next to her.

EDWARD
You alright?

Vivian speaks with an icily calm voice.

VIVIAN
Why do guys always know how to hit
a girl? Wham, right across the
cheek. Nice and high so it feels
like your eye is going to explode.
Pimps, cops, even little asshole
lawyers in suits and ties. They all
hit you the same. What do they do,
take all the boys aside in high
school and show them how?

EDWARD
No one's going to hit you anymore.

VIVIAN
Nobody needs to. He already did a
good enough job.

EDWARD
I'm sorry about that. I don't know
what got into him.

Vivian slowly stands up.

VIVIAN
I'd better go.

EDWARD
Go? You don't have to go. You
didn't do anything | wrong. I kicked
Bill out. We've still got one night
together.

VIVIAN
No. I want to go. I hate it here. I
want to go home.
Edward stands.

EDWARD
Alright. I understand.
113.

Edward reaches into his jacket and pulls out a long gray

envelope.

E DWARD
Here. I was going to give you this
tomorrow, but I'll give it to you
now. It's three thousand.

He holds it out to her, Vivian doesn't take it.
VIVIAN

You can take out five hundred for
tonight.

Edward takes her hand and puts the envelope in it. He

fingers around it.

EDWARD

Don't be silly. Take it all. I may
be petty about money, but I'm not
that etty. You earned it.

eat)
I'm soEey about what happened. I'm
sorry you won't stay,
understand.

Vivian stares down at the envelope. Her eyes moisten.

VIVIAN
You're the nicest guy I've ever
known.

EDWARD
Then stay.

VIVIAN
I don't know.

EDWARD
Stay tonight. Not for the gmoney.
Not because you have to. Stay
because you want to.

closes he

He takes her chin in his hand and kisses her on the lips. As he

pulls back we can see Vivian debating.

VIVIAN
I don't know. I just... don't think
so. My face hurts real bad and I
don't feel so good. It's starting
to swell up.

EDWARD
We don't have to make love. You can
just sleep here and have breakfast
in the morning. Then I'll get you a
cab before I go to the airport.

VIVIAN
I am kind of tired.
114.

EDWARD
Then stay.

Vivian nods. She carefully sets the envelope down on the coffee
table.

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

In the darkened bedroom Vivian and Edward lie together. Edward
sleeps deeply, peacefully, with Vivian's back cuddled in close
to his chest, his arm over her body. Vivian, her face swollen
and puffy from the blow she received, stares into space,
sleepless.

She takes Edward's limp hand in her hands and carefully examines
it. The fingers, the palm, the tiny hairs on the back. She pulls
it in close to her body and holds it tightly. She kisses the
fingers. In a low, barely audible voice she says:

VIVIAN
I... love you.

Almost as if she wanted to hear what it sounded like.

Edward stirs a little but continues to sleep. Vivian stares off
again, her eyes filled with desperate longing. What she has said
to a sleeping hand she would never dare say to his face. She
knows only too well that his reply would not be "I love you,
too". There is nothing she can offer this man. Nothing that
would hold him. Yet there is an emptiness inside her this night
that she cannot bear. If she cannot have his lasting love, at
least she could have a moment of company.

She rolls over and starts to kiss him. Edward stirs.

EDWARD
What? Go back to sleep.

She continues to kiss him, rubbing her hands over his body.

VIVIAN
Make love to me. Make love to me,
please.

Edward sighs and smiles sleepily. He returns her kisses.
INT. BEDROOM - MORNING

Edward, fully dressed in a suit, is packing his bags. Vivian,
dressed in her pink outfit, fingers her clothes in the closet.
She has a nasty blue and purple bruise across her cheek and
under her eye. It is covered with makeup, but with little
success.

Edward is the model of a hurried businessman preparing for his
return trip.

EDWARD ;
We're running little behind. I have
to be at L.A.X. in two hours.
115.

He looks over at Vivian, who is staring forlornly at her
clothes. He tries to understand why she looks so sad.

EDWARD
What's the matter?

VIVIAN
Did... did you want to take these
back?

EDWARD
Of course not. They're yours. Pack
them up.

Vivian smiles. Edward turns and closes his suitcase.

EDWARD
All except the fur, of course.
That's rented.

Vivian pauses. She looks at the beautiful fur coat hanging on
the rac

EDWARD
Damn, I_forgot all about that
thing. I've got to send it back
before I go to the airport. Bring
it along as we go down.

Vivian pulls the fur from the hanger. From her eyes we can tell
that it is going to be very difficult for her to part with it.

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

Edward carries his suitcases out into the living room. He sets
them down and picks up the phone. He dials the lobby.

EDWARD
Could I have a bellboy come up and
help me with some bags? Yes.
Penthouse.

He sets the phone down. Vivian comes into the room, carrying a
few long thin clothes boxes that she has packed her things into.
On top of them is the fur.

EDWARD
When the bellboy comes I'll ask him
to get you a cab, or...

Vivian stands emotionlessly, the boxes held tightly in her arms.
Edward is debating something.

DWARD
Oh, what the hell. You want me to
give you a ride? Would that be
better than a taxi?
116.

VIVIAN
(quietly)
I don't want to make you late.

EDWARD
I think we have time. I just drop
the car off at the airport and take
the plane. The tickets are
reserved. Yes, let's do it that
way. I can drop off the fur on the
way.

The doorbell rings.

EDWARD
Come in!

A bellboy comes in with a small cart. Edward points toward his
bags and the bellboy goes to pick them up.

As the bellboy loads the things onto the cart, Edward glances
around the room to see if anything has been 1éft. He notices the
envelope with the money in it. He picks it up and puts it in his
jacke

INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY

As the elevator opens the Bellboy emerges with Edward's and
Vivian's bags Edward walks straight to the main desk. Vivian
stands in the lobby, holding the fur in her arms. She looks
around the room, taking it all in for one last time.

Edward hands his keys to the Clerk.

EDWARD
Is everything taken care of?

CLERK
Yes sir, I believe so. Let me just
check the phone bill.

Edward stands impatiently.

Mr. ‘Thomas, on patrol through the lobby, sees Vivian and walks
to her.

MR. THOMAS
Well, today's the day. I'll miss
you, Miss Vivian. ope you had a
nice stay.

Vivian is nervous and edgy.

VIVIAN
Oh, yes. It was nice.

MR. THOMAS
So you'll be going to New York with
Mr. Harris?
117.

VIVIAN
No. Back home. Hollywood.

MR. THOMAS
Oh.

He notices the bruise on her face.

MR. THOMAS
(concerned)
Where did you get that bruise?

Vivian touches her face guiltily.

VIVIAN
Oh. I bumped into something. Isn't
that dumb?

Mr. Thomas sees through this obvious lie. Vivian is shaking
nervously.

MR. THOMAS
You're trembling. Is there anything
the matter? Can I help you in any
way?

Vivian is about to say something when Edward comes up behind
them.

EDWARD
All set. Let's go.

Mr. Thomas nods slightly to Edward.

_ MR. THOMAS
Mr. Harris.
EDWARD
Yes. We've got to run. Come on,

Vivian.
Vivian seems reluctant to leave.
VIVIAN .
Could... I get some cigarettes? I
need one.
Edward looks a trifle annoyed.

EDWARD
We're in a rush.

_ VIVIAN
They're just over there.

She points to the dry good store.
118.

h EDWARD
(sighing)
Alright.

Vivian and Edward head toward the store. Vivian glances back at
Mr. Thomas, who is still watching her, concerned.

VIVIAN
Bye. Thanks for everything.

INT. DRY GOOD STORE - DAY

Vivian is standing in front of the counter. Edward is gazing at
a magazine rack.

VIVIAN
Virginia Slim Lights.

The clerk sets the cigarettes down on the counter. Edward
quickly tosses him a couple dollars.

Edward pulls a woman's magazine from the rack and shows the
cover to Vivian. On it is a stunningly beautiful young woman.

EDWARD
That's Cindy.

Vivian takes her cigarettes and stares at the cover.

VIVIAN
She's... beautiful.

EDWARD
She's very little. Just over five
feet. But she's got the best body.
It's perfect, and her face... you
can see.

He tosses the magazine back onto the rack and starts to lead her
out.

EDWARD
Dumber than a doornail, though. I
guess they beat the intelligence
out of you in finishing school.

As they exit, Vivian glances back to the smiling face on the
magazine.

EXT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL DRIVEWAY - DAY

Edward and Vivian come out of the hotel to their waiting car.
The bellboy has finished packing the bags in the trunk. Edward
tips him.

The valets open the doors and Edward and Vivian get in. Edward
tips the valets. They shut the doors. The Mercedes drives off.
119.

INT. MERCEDES - DAY

As Edward drives the car down Wilshire, Vivian is nervously
smoking a cigarette, The fur is in her lap and she is
unconsciously stroking it.

EDWARD
How don do you think it will take
to rom Beverly Hills to
Hol Swoods

VIVIAN

I don't know for sure. Ten minutes
or something.

Edward glances at his watch.

EDWARD
And an hour to get to the airport.
(shaking his head)
I don't know why I always cut these
things so close.

Edward slows the car down as they approach a parking spot in

front of the furrier. He pulls in and stops e@ car.
DWARD
I'll just run in and get rid of

this.

He reaches over and takes the fur from Vivian. Vivian quickly
turns her head away. Edward notices.

EDWARD
What's the matter?

VIVIAN
Noth'n.

Edward stares at the back of her head for a moment and then
decides he doesn't have time to pursue it. He gets out of the
car.

As she watches Edward take the fur into the store, tears roll
down Vivian's cheeks. She takes a drag from her cigarette. She
stashes it out in the car's ashtray.

Within seconds, Edward is back out of the store. He rounds the
car and jumps in.

EDWARD
Alright. That's done.

Edward puts the car into gear and drives off.

Now Vivian is crying harder. So much that she can't conceal her
sobs. Edward glances over at her, concerned and annoyed at the
same time.
120.

EDWARD
Now what? What's the matter?

Vivian is crying hard. She can't talk. Edward continues to drive

on.

EDWARD
Jesus. What is it? Can you tell me
why you're upset now? Damn it, I
don't even know how to get back to
Hollywood.

VIVIAN
(choking it out)
Just go straight!

EDWARD
What happened to you? Is it the
fur? You didn't expect me to let
you keep it, did you? It was
rented.

VIVIAN
(still crying)
Just forget it!

Vivian tries to control herself. She wipes her eyes and manages
to stop the tears.

EDWARD
Is that it? The fur?

VIVIAN
Just stop it! Why do you always
pick at me? I don't want to talk.
You always make me talk.

EDWARD
I just want to know what's going
on. If you're unhappy and there is
something I can do...

VIVIAN
Yes! I loved that fur! Now leave me
alone.

EDWARD
Vivian. I didn't mean it to end
like this. I mean, be reasonable.
fhat's a twenty thousand dollar
ur.

VIVIAN
I didn't say I wanted it. I knew
you were going to take it back.
Okay? I'm not dumb! I knew I
couldn't have it. You asked me why
I was crying and I told you!

Edward is quiet for a_ moment. Vivian has managed to control her
crying. She stares coldly ahead.
121.

VIVIAN
Make a left on Highland. Right
there.

Edward turns the car and they head up Highland. Edward's face is
tense.

EDWARD
Look, if you really want a fur,
I'll buy you a fur. That one was
just too expensive. Would you like
a fur?

VIVIAN
No. Just take me home.

EDWARD
I'll get you a fur. I'll miss my
plane, but if it'll make yee stop
crying I'll buy you something.

VIVIAN
(angril
I'm not crying anymore.

EDWARD
God damn it, Vivian. I'll buy you a
fur. A nice one. Just it can't be
that one. That one's too much. I'll
get you the silver mink you tried
on first. I'll throw away a few
thousand. Okay? I don't know what
the fuck you plan to do with one on
Hollywood Boulevard, but...

VIVIAN
LEAVE ME ALONE! I DON'T WANT
ANYTHING FROM YOU!

Edward slams on the brakes. The car stops hard. Vivian stares at
him defiantly.

VIVIAN
You want me to walk home!? I'll
walk home! It's three miles but
I'll walk!

EDWARD
I don't want you to walk! I want
you to stop yelling!

Vivian turns from him and stares out her window. Edward takes a
deep breath and starts the car up again.

Vivian stares out the window. They are leaving the nice, well-
tended homes of Hancock Park and are approaching the streets of
Hollywood.

They are both tensely silent as Edward drives on. Vivian begins
to cry softly.
122.

Edward listens to her with annoyance, but resists the impulse to
say anything.

They approach Hollywood Blvd. and Edward makes a right.

As Vivian stares out the window of the Mercedes she sees the
grimy streets and the shabby people mixing with the occasional
tourists. As they continue down the street toward Vivian's
section of the Boulevard we will see less and less tourists and
even shabbier-looking people. The streets become more grim and
irty.

Vivian is sobbing harder now, trying to control herself but
unable. Edward, getting madder as it grows louder, finally
ursts.

EDWARD
I don't know why you had _to do this
to me. We had a wonderful time
together and now you have to ruin
it.

Vivian grits her teeth and tries not to say anything. Edward,
now that he's gotten it out of his system, adopts a slightly
gentler tone as he continues to lecture her.

EDWARD
You should have told me you like
the fur so much. I could have
gotten you something yesterday -
It's really a stupi hing to cry
about. You know I bent over
backwards to make things pleasant
for you and it's just a shame that
you re going to spoil it all by
eing unreasonable.

The streets they pass are now filled mostly with drug dealers,
an occasional prostitute, and various homeless tramps. Vivian
stares out the window at the destitution outside, her eyes fixed
and red. She is on the verge of a nervous breakdown.

EDWARD
This is about the area. Do you want
me to leave boo her, or do you have
a place near

Vivian says nothing.
EDWARD
Vivian? Where do you want me to let
you off?

Vivian screams hysterically. She seems to have suddenly gone
crazy. She starts pounding the roof of the car with her fists.

Edward guickly pulls the car over to the curb and stops it.
Vivian is still screaming and pounding.

EDWARD
VIVIAN! VIVIAN, CUT IT OUT!
123.

Edward grabs her by the wrists and tries to stop her from
pounding the ceiling. Instead she starts pounding him.

EDWARD
Get out! GET OUT OF THE CAR!

Vivian continues to pound him for a moment, but then she breaks
down and starts to sob limply.

EDWARD
You're out of your mind. You're
insane!
Vivian is crying.
EDWARD
I've had enough of this. Get out of
the car.
Vivian doesn't move.
EDWARD

Get out of the car!

When she still doesn't move, Edward throws open his door and
gets out.

EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD - CONTINUOUS

Edward walks around the car and opens the trunk. He pulls out
Vivian's few boxes of clothes and sets them down on the curb. He
shuts the trunk.

He walks over to the passenger door and opens it.

EDWARD
(firmly)
Get out.

Vivian doesn't move. She is still crying.

EDWARD
Don't make me regret ever picking
you up. Now please, get out of the
car. have to go.

Edward grabs her by the hand and starts to pull her from the
car. Vivian explodes again and starts hitting and kicking him.

Edward forcibly drags her from the car and then throws her to
the ground. He slams the door shut.

As Vivian hits the ground she begins to cry again, too weak to
fight anymore.

Edward looks down at her. He takes the money envelope from his
jacket and holds it out to her.
124.

EDWARD

Here, take it. It's your money.
VIVIAN

(sobbing in fits)

I don't want it. Just go away.
EDWARD

Take it.
VIVIAN

No.
EDWARD

You'll regret it tomorrow if you
don't take it. You'll regret it the
minute I drive away.

Vivian doesn't say anything. Edward lays the envelope down on
the sidewalk in front of her.

He turns and walks around the car. Vivian lies frozen for a
moment and then suddenly snaps alive as she hears the sound of
his car door opening and closing.

She grabs the envelope and crushes it in her hand. She leaps at
the car and starts smashing her fists against it and the
windows.

VIVIAN

Go to hell! I hate you! I hate your

money! I hate it!
We see a flash of Edward's face as he stares at Vivian pounding
on his window. She's completely lost her mind. He puts the car
in gear and pushes on the accelerator.
Vivian is still pounding as the car pulls away. In a final
gesture of rage she throws the envelope at the car and it breaks
open as the car peels off.

The money scatters across the gutter as the car drives away.
Vivian falls to her knees, weak and crying.

Across the street various shabby-looking people stare at Vivian
and the money.

Vivian is on her hands and knees sobbing. She can barely
breathe. She is completely broken.

She wipes the tears from her cheeks. She looks down the street.
The Mercedes is gone.

For a brief moment she is still, frozen like a statue.
She reaches down in the gutter and starts to pick up the money.

DISSOLVE TO:
125.

EXT. BUS - DAY

An old Greyhound bus drives down the freeway from Los Angeles.
It moves easily through the traffic. A small sign over the
windshield reads: DISNEYLAND.

INT. BUS - DAY

Vivian and Kit are sitting in the bus. Kit is sitting next to
the window, looking outside with a warm, happy smile. She is so
excited she can barely stand it.

KIT
Could I get one of those balloons?
You know, with the ears?

Vivian_sits next to Kit staring off with utterly blank and empty
eyes. The side of her cheek is still bruised. She is wearin er
mint green dress, but her hair is poorly done and lies limply

around her pale face. Kit coughs.
KIT
Oh, I guess that's stupid. Those
are for kids.
Vivian blinks and glances over at Kit, tired.
VIVIAN
No, babe. You can have a balloon.
One with the ears.

Kit smiles happily and looks back out the window. Vivian stares
emptily ahead.

FADE OUT:
