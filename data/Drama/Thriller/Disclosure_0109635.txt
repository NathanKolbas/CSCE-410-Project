five year old zips his sweatshirt.

TOM SANDERS, 41 years old, suit and tie, an ID BADGE on his
pocket, confronts his daughter, her jacket in his fist. The
smile of a ladies’ man. The build of a varsity athlete. Still
something of the high school hero about him.

That is our commodity. We offer

never delivered--freedom from the
physical body. Freedom from race

personality, from place and time.

an advantage.

CONLEY
Wait a minute. You’re the head

FERNANDEZ
Isn’t it true, Ms. Johnson, that
you told Mrs. Ross three weeks
ago you wanted a special bottle
of chardonnay for your meeting
with Mr. Sanders?

MEREDITH
No. That’s not true.

FERNANDEZ
That’s not what she says.

JUDGE MURPHY
Ms. Fernandez, do you have
testimony from Ms. Johnson’s
assistant? '

FERNANDEZ
Yes I do.

JUDGE MURPHY
Ms. Johnson?

Meredith takes. a beat.

MEREDITH
The fact is, Mrs. Ross has some - 9
personal problems. She’s been in 9S

and out of rehab twice since she 99
started working for me. Her 9
family is very prominent, and
she’s...well, a failure in their
eyes. She tends to make up

stories so she‘ll seem more
important. Less of a failure.

I told Mrs. Ross to get a bottle

of wine after Tom asked for it,

at the Conley-White lunch. For

all I know, she had that bottle

at home.

JUDGE MURPHY
Ms. Fernandez, any more
questions?

FERNANDEZ
Not for now.

Obviously, what we have here are
two basically incompatible
accounts of the incident.

(off notes)
Certain facts are consistent in
both stories. The parties had a
previous sexual history. Wine
was drunk by both parties. Mr.
Sanders rubbed Ms. Johnson’s
shoulders. There was kissing.
Mr. Sanders’ penis was in Ms.
Johnson’s mouth. Mr. Sanders
removed Ms. Johnson's panties.
Sexual intercourse dic not occur.

I wonder if you could review for oN

SANDERS
Sure, Meredith. “Diana” is our
name for a stand-alone CD-ROM
drive player. For CD-ROM to be
effective, it has to be portable--

Conley-White executive, who then passes it along...

And it has to be fast. “Diana”
is twice as fast as any CD-ROM
drive in the world. We've in
production now. We’ve had some
early problems, but we're solving
them.

MEREDITH
And the problems we've had--were
they design problems?

SANDERS
What we have is a fabrication
problem involving the production
line in Malaysia.

MEREDITH
What sort of problems?

SANDERS
For example, we should be using
automatic chip installers to lock
the controller chip on the board,
but .the Malays on the line have
been installing the chips by
hand. Literally pushing them in
with their thumbs. And the air.
in the plant is dirty. The PPU--
particulates per unit--is running
as high as eleven. It should be
zero. We should have level-seven
air handlers, but we only have
level-five air handlers instead.

And we should be ordering %
components like hinge rods and ©
clips from our usual Singapore oy

supplier. The ones we're getting .%
are less expensive, but less an
reliable. roy

MEREDITH
I’m confused here. You set up
this line, Tom. You didn’t
anticipate these problems?

specifications were altered.
