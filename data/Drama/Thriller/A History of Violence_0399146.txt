A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE

by

Josh Olson
EXT. CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY - MORNING

A battered old motel by the side of the road. The roof is
chopped up, nasty looking. Paint peels from the walls. A
large, pathetic green papier maché dinosaur - some toothless
mental case's idea of a Tyrannosaurus Rex is situated in
front of the office. A sign reads “Rooms $24.98 and up!”

The door to one of the units opens and LELAND, a reedy
looking guy, almost made out of beef jerky, steps out, small
suitcase in hand and takes in the morning. A voice calls out
from inside.

BILLY
You think maybe we could just turn
around?

LELAND
Nah.

BILLY - shorter, chunkier, wearing jeans and an old Johnny
Cash tee shirt - walks out, hefting a grubby backpack and
lighting a cigarette.

LELAND {cont’d)
Life's all about chaices, Billy. Ain’t no
video game where you get to hit the
restart button any time you ain‘t happy.

They walk over to a well worn old convertible. Leland takes

the top down and: throws his suitcase in the back. Billy does
the same with his pack.

LELAND (cont'd)
We are who we are and we done what we
done. Whatever.

BILLY
Yeah, I guess. I’m just tired, though.

LELAND
Yuh. Me, too.

He tosses Billy the keys.
LELAND (cont‘d)
Here. Warm ‘er up and bring ‘er on up to

the office. I’m gonna go check us out.

BILLY
say.

Leland walks towards the office as Billy climbs into the car.
Billy sits in the driver seat and looks around.

@ CONTINUED:

The sun beats down on the desert. No breeze, just a faint,
low electric hum from the power lines that head off into the
distance. Billy closes his eyes and enjoys the sun on his
face. de sighs and puts the key in the ignition. The engine
starts. Billy kicks it into gear and slowly pulls out.

He drives the car up to the office and slows down, leaving
the engine idling. He slides a casette tane - Johnny Cash ~
into the player and leans back, waiting patiently for his
friend.

A long beat, and then Leland walks out of the office.

BILLY (cont’d}
What took so long?

LELAND
Nothin’. Little trouble with the maid,
but everything’s fine now. Johnny!

BILLY
Johnny.

Leland, humming along with Johnny, slides into the drivers
seat as Billy slides over.

@ LELAND

Damn, Eight AM and already this hot.

BILLY
Yuh.

LELAND
We got any water?

BILLY
Prolly not enough.

LELAND
Yeah. There‘s a machine back in the
office.

BILLY
I'll go.

He climbs out of the car and Leland gets behind the wheel.
Billy walks to the motel office.

INT. MOTEL OFFICE

It's quiet. Billy walks in and looks around, sees what he‘s

. looking for. He walks across the room and as he goes, we see
blood splattered on the wali.

e (CONTINUED }
CONTINUED:

Pull back to reveal the MOTEL CLERK behind the desk, shot in
the chest, dead. A MAID lies on the floor in a pool of blood,
shot in the head. Billy steps over her and goes to a cooler
against the wall and takes out three bottles of water.

He hears a noise and freezes. He turns to see the bathroom
door against the far wall open, and a LITTLE GIRL steps ont.
She sees the tableau in front of her and gasps.

Billy drops the bottles and pulls a revolver out of his
waistband and points it at the girl. She looks at him in

terror and opens her mouth to scream. Billy’s finger tightens
on the trigger.

cur TO:
BLACK
A scream rips through the silence.
INT. MCKENNA HOUSE - TOM & EDIE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
TOM MCKENNA, a slightly weathered husband and father of two,
snaps awake at the sound of the scream and leaps out of bed,
races to the door in the dark.

INT. MCKENNA HOUSE - SARAH‘S ROOM

SARAH MCKENNA - an adorable five year old girl - is sitting
bolt upright in her bed, screaming.

A light snaps on as Tom, wearing pajama bottoms and a worried
look - comes racing in to save his daughter.

He takes her in his arms.

TOM
Sarah! Honey! What‘s wrong? What is it?

His daughter stops screaming and looks around blearily, then up at her
father.

SARAH
Daddy? Daddy?

TOM
Daddy’s here, baby. Daddy’s here.

SARAH
There were monsters!

{CONTINUED )
CONTINUED:

TOM
No, baby. There's no such thing as monsters. It
was just a bad dream. Daddy’s here now.

JACK McKENNA, 16, hair a mess, wearing a Beastie Boys tee shirt and
boxers, walks in the door.

JACK
What's wrong, Dad?

TOM
Hey, kiddo. Sarah just had a bad dream.

SARAB
T saw monsters, Jacki

Jack walks over to his sister’s bed and sits down beside her.

JACK
Monsters! Cool! What kind?

Tom shoots his son a dirty look.

SARAH
I don’t know. They were in the shadows.

JACK
Hmnm. Shadow monsters. They look pretty scary. But
they can’t really do anything. Especially when the
lights are on. They're afraid of the light.

TOM
Jack!

EDIE MCKENNA, a strong and lovely woman, possibly a little younger
than Tom, stands in the doorway in a robe.

EDIE
What happened?

TOM
Sarah had a bad dream about monsters. (Shoots a
look at Jack) I’m telling her there are no
monsters.

SARAH
Jack says shadow monsters are afraid of the light.

Tom shakes his head. Edie smiles.
EDIE

It would seem there are two schools of thought on
the matter.

(CONTINUED }
CONTINUED: (2}

TOM
You could say that.

SARAH
I‘m going to turn on my night light, just in case.

EDIE
That sounds like a brilliant solution.

Edie sits on the bed and hugs her daughter. Tom smiles and puts his
arm around his son, who pulls away, embarrassed. He is, after all, 16.

EXT. MCKENNA HOUSE

A large, sturdy farmhouse in the middle of a huge corn field ~ the
house is at least a hundred years old, and well kept up. An old
station wagon parked in front of a small barn. One barn door is open,
revealing an old pickup inside. A tricycle in front of the porch. A
propane tank a few yards from the front of the house, off to the side.
Halfway across the field, a tiny shack that hasn't seen use in
decades. On the other side of the house from the barn, a swing set and
a small slide.

Dawn's rosy fingers creep across the cornfield. Another day in
Taylorville, Indiana.

EXT. HANK QUIGLEY’S HOUSE - MORNING

A small, dilapidated two bedroom house on the side of the
road, Probably built around the same time as the McKenna
house, the difference is nobody‘s spent any time keeping this
place up. Paint peels, boards are cracked and weathered, and
the whole place looks two steps away from being abandoned.

INT. HANK QUIGLEY’S BEDROOM

A small room, sparsely furnished. A small dresser in the corner with a
dirty, cracked mirror. A dozen different vials of prescription
medicine are strewn around on it. The sun streams harshly through the
small window.

HANK QUIGLEY, late fifties/early sixties - once a rock of a man, now
gone a little soft - sits on the bed in old boxers. Ke has two round

scars on his upper chest. His eyes are moist as he looks at a wedding
photo of Tom and Edie.

A half empty bottle of whiskey sits on the night stand. Hank takes it,
raises it to his lips, then pauses. He puts it back on the stand,
looks at it a beat, then puts down the photo and gets up, walks to the
bathroom. lle stops by the dresser, bends over and picks up a pill
bottle, puts it on the dresser.

(CONTINUED )
CONTINUED;

For the first time we see his back - there are at least half a dozen
smaller round scars spread across it.

He walks into the bathroom, and we hear the sound of a shower going
on.

INT. McKENNA HOUSE - KITCHEN ~ MORNING

Edie, Tom and Sarah sit around a table, eating breakfast.

SARAH
I think Jack‘s right about shadow
monsters, Daddy.

TOM
Oh, really?

She nods.

SARAH
But I think there's something he doesn‘t
know.

EDIE
What's that, honey?

SARAH
I think shadow monsters aren‘t as bad as
other monsters. And I think when other
monsters come, the shadow monsters beat
them up.

TOM
Sort of protector monsters, then.

She nods and eats a spoonful of cereal. Edie smiles, then
looks Over at the empty space on the table and frowns.

EDIE
(Calling out)
Jack!
dack walks in, dressed for school.

JACK
What?

Edie shakes her head. Jack sits down at the table, turns to
Sarah.

dack {cont'd}
Night Light worked, didn’t it?

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

She nods vigorously. Tom turns to Edie.

TOM
I‘m running a bit late today. Can you
drop me off on the way in?

EDIE
Sure.

TOM
Great. Thanks. (Turns to Jack) What do
you have going on today?

JACK
Nothing much. Math test in a few days. I
think we're playing baseball in gym
today, so I can look forward to sucking
hard in right field,

TOM
You remember what I told you, right? Hang
back. Never let the hitter get one over
your head,..

JACK
Unless it's over the fence,

TOM
Right!

They continue their pleasant, familial chatter as we slowly
pull back.

EXT, TAYLORVILLE - ROAD ~ DAY
The McKenna‘s station wagon tools down the road towards town.

INT. McKENNA‘S STATION WAGON

Edie‘s at the wheel. Tom sits next to her, looking out the window.

Edie notices the half smile on his face.

EDIE
What?

TOM
Hmm? Oh, just thinking about Jack and Sarah.

EDIE
They're pretty incredible.

{CONTINUED }
CONTINUED:

a

TOM
That’s an understatement. Her whole theory about
shadow monsters protecting her from worse
monsters?

EDIE
Awful young for that kind of moral
relativity.

TOM
Yeah. I guess. She’s just brilliant.
They’re both brilliant.

EDIE
God, it’s amazing, isn’t it?

TOM
What’s that?

EDIE
One minute you're this dumb kid, running around
like an idiot, getting inte trouble, dreaming
these impossible dreams, and then, all of a
sudden, you're this grown-up sitting around
worrying about whether or not your children are
gonna be okay.

TOM
I remember reading a book in high school
that had a bit about that. Something
about how one moment summer vacation’s
the longest stretch of time imaginable
and an unhooked bra strap is as close to
heaven as you can possibly imagine. The
next, you‘re middle aged wondering where
it all went.

EDIE
Don‘t be in such a hurry. We’re not
middle aged yet.

TOM
Yeah, I know.

EDIE
t don’t feel like a real grown-up yet.

TOM
Yeah. You think we ever will?

{CONTINUED )
CONTINUED: (2)

EDIE
Yup. Everyone does, eventually. Sooner or later,
you're gonna wake up and find out you've turned
into that cranky old guy who yeils out the window,
“Keep that noise down, you gaddam kids!”

‘TOM
God. Kill me before that happens, okay?

EDIE
Oh, honey, I’11 have left you long before that.

She smiles at him, and slows the car down. He leans towards her and
they kiss. The kiss grows long and passionate - Edie is surprised, but
happy. Tom’s hand slides inside the back of her shirt and moves
towards her bra. She pulls away, laughing.

EDIE (cont‘d)
What are you doing?

TOM
You know, an unhooked bra is still pretty
damn close to heaven.

EDIE
You're a nut.

He smiles warmly at her.
EDIE (cont'd)
I‘1l be done early today. All I have is the
Watson's will and Dave Ryan‘s tractor sale, Want
me to come pick you up?

TOM
We can go to the drive-in and make out tonight.

EDIE
Tom, there hasn’t been a drive-in in this
town since the early nineties.

He smiles and looks intently at her. She looks back with the
same intensity. These two are still very much in love.

EXT. TAYLORVILLE OUTSKIRTS

Tom gets out of the car, and Edie drives away. Tom walks towards town.
EXT. TAYLORVILLE - CENTER

A small town, pleasant and clean. Shops line the streets, and cars
drive by - people on their way to work and school. Tom walks down the

street, clearly enjoying the sun on his face.

{CONTINUED )
 

CONTINUED;

A deep, thumping bass fades up behind him, and Tom turns to see a car
cruising towards him, rap blasting out of it. THREE HIGH SCHOOL KIDS
are in the car. Tom waves at the car as it goes by. The car slows, and
JARED, the driver leans out the window.

JARED
Hey, Mr. McKenna!

TOM
Hey, Jared.

JARED
Charlotte told me to tell you she's gonna have to
be half an hour late this afternoon.

TOM
Okay, Jared. Thanks.

JARED
No problem.

The car peels out, music still pounding. Tom watches them go, smiling.
TOM
{To himself)
Keep that noise down, you goddam kids.
EXT. McKENNA’S DINER - DAY
A very nice, clean diner on a well travelled street. A couple of
LOCALS walk by and wave to Tom as he approaches the diner. He opens

the door, then pauses when he sees something.

He leans down and scrapes a smudge off the window with his finger. He
walks into the diner.

INT. McKENNA'S DINER
PAT JOHNSON, a wiry man in his mid fifties in dusty overalls sits at

the counter, sipping at a cup of coffee. He‘s the classic Midwestern
farmer.

MICK, the short order cock back in the kitchen waves as Tom comes in.

TOM
Morning Pat, Mick.

PAT

Who‘s the craziest woman you ever dated?
TOM

Whoa, ‘scuse me?

{CONTINUED )
CONTINUED:

ll.

PAT
Mick and me's just talkin’ about women we been
with. He once dated a woman used te attack him in
the middle of the night.

TOM
She what?

MICK
She'd have these crazy goddam dreams where instead
of her boyfriend, I was some kind of demented
killer. I woke up one night she'd stuck a goddam
fork in my arm.

TOM
Jesus.

MICK
i’m spurtin' blood and she’s sittin’ there,
crying, goin‘ “Baby, I love you, I love you.”

TOM
If she really loved you, she’d have used a spoon.

Pat cracks up. Mick smiles.

TOM (cont’d)
You dumped her, right?

MICK
Nope. Married her. Lasted six years.

TOM
You married her?

MICK
Well, yeah. Nobody's perfect, Tom.

Tom nods = he can’t argue with that.

PAT
Yeah, well, I got that beat. I dated a
psychiatrist in New York for a whole year.

MICK
Hard to top that.

PAT
I’m tellin’ you, there’s only one reason a person
gets into that line of work, and it’s not to help
crazy folks.

TOM
What the hell were you doing in New York?

PAT

You ain’t the only one from out of town. I was
born and raised there.

TOM
In New York?

PAT
Uh huh.

TOM
city?

PAT
Well, sure.

MICK
Who's the craziest girl you ever went out
with, Tom?

TOM
I dunno. I never really had any crazy
girlfriends.

PAT
Sure wasn't Edie.

TOM
Ha. No. She's definitely the sanest woman
I've ever known.

PAT
Honest, too.

TOM
Yup.

PAT
When she helped me sell the farm...

TOM
I remember this.

PAT
That big combine tried to slide some shit
in, some mumbo jumbo that‘d have me
paying the closing costs. They claimed it
was just a little mistake, but she went
on the warpath, I’m telling you.

CONTINUED: (3)

PAT (cont'd)
These companies, they slip in a line
here, a line there, hoping you don’t
catch it and they just screw you a little
more.

TOM
Yeah, she hates that. Edie couldn't cheat
someone if her life depended on it.

Par
Good woman.

TOM
I remember we're out on our first date,
and that song Me & Mrs. Jones comes on.
{fom chuckles) We’re talking about the
lyrics, how it’s about this guy screwing
some other guy‘s wife, and Edie? She’s
stunned. She alwayS thought it was Mr.
Jones singing about how great his wife
was.

Tom shakes his head in amusement, then spots something outside ~ Hank

Quigley stands outside, looking in thoughtfully.

TOM (cont‘d)
‘scuse me, fellas.

He walks to the door and opens it, just as a MIDDLE AGED WOMAN walks

through,

MIDDLE AGED WOMAN
Morning, Tom.

TOM
Morning, Patty. I‘1l be right in to help you.

She walks over to a booth and Tom steps outside.

EXT. McKENNA’S DINER

Hank looks uncertainly at the door. Tom nods and opens it for him, and
Hank walks in.

INT. MCKENNA’S DINER
Tom leads Hank to a corner booth.

TOM
Mick, take care of Patty, would you?

Mick waves acknowledgement and Tom sits down across from Hank.

BANK
I know I got no call to come to you like this,
Tom. We don't have nothing even looks like a
relationship.

TOM
Weli, no, but, you know, come on. We're like
family... What can I...?

No, Family’s more than just names.
TOM
Well... Yeah. I guess. But Still.... What's on

HANK
How's Edie doin'?

TOM
She’s good, Hank. She’s really good.

Hank nods.
TOM (cont'd)
You know, maybe you should, you know, come by or

something. Some time.

HANK
Yeah. That’s what I wanted to talk to you about.

Tom waits patiently for Hank to collect his thoughts. Pat walks by,

‘em. T made a mess of my life, Tom. A real mess.
You know Edie and I ain’t exactly been close.

TOM
Yeah.

HANK
I want to try to make some things up to her. I’d
like to get to know my grandchildren before...
Before they're not children anymore.

TOM
I think they‘d like that.

HANK
You think? I ain't the best person, But I‘d like
to try to make up for that.

TOM

I'll bring it up to Edie, Hank. I‘1l see what 7
can do.

TOM (cont'd)
Can I get you anything? You want some breakfast?

HANK
Naw. I ate already. I best be moving along.

TOM
Okay.

Hank gets up and walks to the door. He stops, turns to Tom, and nods
in gratitude. Tom nods back, then gets up and walks back to the

counter,

MICK
Hank Quigley, huh? Man, he used to be one mean old
son of a bitch.

TOM
That‘s what I hear.

INT. TAYLORVILLE HIGH - BASEBALL FIELD - DAY

Gym class ~ A softball game in progress. Jack sits on a bench by the

Jack stands out in deep right field bored out of his mind. In the
distance, on the track, Judy runs past and waves.

BOBBY JORDAN, class jock and all round tough guy, walks up to bat. One
man‘s already on third base.

BOBBY
One winning run, coming up.

His teammates cheer - “Go get ‘em, Bobby!” etc.
The PITCHER winds up and pitches. Ball. Bobby sidesteps it.

The pitcher winds up again and fires. Jack steps back, deeper into

He bends over and looks at her engine, still smiling. She
watches nervously from the side. Billy gestures to her.

BILLY (cont‘d}
It ain't the engine, it’s the carburator.

Oh yeah?
EDIE

Yeah.

Cannonball!

EXT. POND - NIGHT

The McKenna‘s station wagon sits near an idyllic pond. A
cooler full of beer sits nearby, and a small boom box sits on
the hood, blasting late seventies rock and rall.

Edie is in the water, naked. A naked Tom flies through the
air, curled in @ ball, and lands with a huge splash. Edie
laughs, and Tom swims up to her and they kiss.

A loud buzzing, and Tom breaks the kiss to swat at a
mosquito.

TOM
Damn!

EDIE
Yeah, that’s kind of the downside.

TOM
That and the freezing water.

EDIE
Sort of makes it hard to achieve the
desired effect, huh?
‘TOM
Honey, there’s nothing hard within a mile
of this place.
Another mosquito buzzes by and Edie swats at it.
TOM (cant‘d)
You ever think maybe kids didn’t come
here because it was so perfect but
because they didn’t have anywhere else to
make out?
She looks at him thoughtfully, then smiles.
EXT. POND - TWENTY SECONDS LATER

Edie and Tom, now loosely dressed, leap into the car and peel
out.

INT. McKENNA HOUSE - TOM AND EDIE‘S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Edie comes out of the bathroom in her nightgown. She lays down next to
him end kisses him warmly on the mouth.

Tom smiles and runs his fingers through her hair. He seems a
little distant.

EDIE (cont'd)
What is it?

He rolls over takes her head in his hands and looks intently
into her eyes.

TOM
Tt’s so amazing. L remember the moment T
knew you were in love with me. IT saw it
in your eyes in an instant. I can still
see it.

EDIE
Of course you can. I still love you.

TOM
I am the luckiest son of a bitch alive.

He eases back, petting her head, eyes looking off in the
distance.

EDIE

What is it, honey? What's wrong?
TOM

You're gonna hate my timing.
EDIE

What?
‘TOM

Your father came by the diner today.
She tenses at this,

EDIE
What did he want?

TOM

He wants to see you, honey. He wants to
meet the kids.

TOM
He was a drunk. He used to hit you, I
know. Nothing good comes out of that. But
he seems...

EDIE
No. T don't care. I don’t care why he did
what he did. I don't want to see him, and
I don’t want him near my children.

TOM
IT don’t know the man. We’ve met maybe
five times in eighteen years, and today
was the longest we ever talked. But the
man who came into the diner today was
beaten down. He knows he screwed up,
Edie. He wants to make amends, TI think.

EDIE
He can't.

TOM
Honey.... People change.

EDIE
1 know that, Tom. People change every
day. You hear people talk, and Hank
Quigley was the nicest man in town before
the war. But what happened over there
sure as hell changed him.

TOM
It changed a lot of people.

everything she could to help him, to look
past what he‘d become.

TOM

grandparents. I didn't exactly provide
well on that front.

She leans down and runs her hand down his cheek.

EDIE
You're the best man I've ever known, Tom
McKenna, and you provide for this family
every single day.

She rolls over and hits the switch on the bedside lamp. It
flickers on and off, and she grimaces. Tom smiles and leans
over her and shakes it, and the light snaps on in full. She
kisses him on the cheek in gratitude, and picks up some
papers and starts to read.

Tom looks at his wife thoughtfully. A smile spreads across
his face, and he rolis over to go to sleep.

EXT, TAYLORVILLE — AFTERNOON

‘Tom walking down the street. Town's a little more crowded than last
time - it’s Saturday afternoon,

A pair of kids race by Tom. One kid has plastic Wolverine claws, the
other is wearing huge green Hulk fists. He smiles as they pretend to
duke it out.

INT. McKENNA’S DINER
The place is crowded. Charlotte is delivering a meal to a table. Mick
is cranking away at a dozen orders. Tom walks in, SAM CARNEY, the

local sheriff, sits at the counter sucking down some coffee. Tom slaps
him on the back.

TOM

EXT. TOWN SQUARE — NIGHT

The town square‘s a nice piece of land. Well kept, a few trees, with
City Hall - the nicest building in town ~ right in the center. Kids in
cars drive around and around, music blasting from every window.

Jack and Judy sit alongside the building, passing a joint back and
forth, watching the kids go round and round.

JUDY
You ever wonder what kids did for fun on a
Saturday night a hundred years ago?

JACK
I dunno. I always figured they got into their
parents’ wagon and went cruising around their town
square playing loud banjo music and acting like
idiots.

JUDY
So you think this is as good as it gets?

JACK
For us? Yeah. For now. Eventually we grow up and
get jobs and have affairs and eventually become
alcoholics.

Judy Looks at him a long beat, then takes a hit off the joint.

JUDY
Ya know, sometimes you depress me.

Jack smiles.

He swerves into the next lane, and a horn honks loudly at him. He hits
the brake and looks back, sees he's almost driven into another car ~ a
battered old pickup. He flips the truck the finger- Leland and Billy
sit inside the truck. Billy gives Bobby a very cold glare and Bobby
polls back his finger, scared. Billy nods and they drive on-

BUDDY #1
Who the fuck was that?

BOBBY
I don't know. And I don’t want to.

LELAND

change anything?

BILLY
I’m just sick of this shit.

LELAND
Yeah, you made that clear about ten thousand miles

I don’t want to hear about it anymore.

BILLY

Mick's behind the stove, cleaning and closing the place down,
Charlotte's wiping down a table. JEFF and LISA, a pair of high school
kids sit at a booth, eating ice cream. Tom is sitting behind the
counter, talking to Pat, who’s finishing up his dinner.

PAT
Good as ever, Tom.

Pat slaps some bills down on the counter and heads for the door. He
waves to Mick, who waves back.

PAT (cont'd)
See you in church, Tom.

TOM
Ayuh. Have a good evening.

Pat opens the deor to walk out, and bumps smack into Leland.

PAT
Oh, excuse me,

scared. He turns to Leland.

LELAND
Yeah, her. Fuck her. Do it.

TOM
No! Don’t!

Billy shrugs and pulls the trigger.
Click.

Billy looks at the gun, puzzled. Leland looks to Billy - what the
fuck?

Without even thinking, Tom lashes out with the coffee pot, smashing it
into Leland’s face, the glass shattering. Leland cries out and drops
his gun, falls to the floor.

 

Tom leaps over the counter and picks up Leland’s gun.

Billy quickly ratchets another bullet into the chamber of his gun and
turns to Tom.

Tom fires, hitting Billy in the chest, sending him spinning-

Lisa screams.

Leland grabs a knife from the floor and slams it into Tom‘s foot. Tom
screams in pain and whirls, sees Leland on the floor, the knife in his
hand, and fires down, through the top of Leland’s head. Leland’s face
explodes in a shower of gore.

Billy staggers towards Tom, clutching his bloody chest, his gun in his
other hand.

BILLY
MOTHERFUCKER! !!

He raises the gun to fire again. Tom whips the gun up and fires,
hitting Billy in the stomach and sending him crashing through the
diner window in a shower of glass.

people yell and shout and scream.

Tom struggles to stand upright, blood gushing from his foot.

Mitch runs over to him and holds him up,

The rest is a swirl of disconnected images from Tom's POV:

Sam, the local sheriff, bursts into the diner, gun in hand.

An ambulance in front of the diner.

A crowd of people watching as PARAMEDICS lead Tom to the ambulance.
Jack and Judy in front of the crowd, watching in shock. Jack reaches

Look, mister. I've been exceedingly
polite to you, but if I have to, I'll
call the authorities and we can take this
up with them. I will not have anyone come
into my business and threaten me.

CHARLIE
Mr. Torrino’s just making conversation.

Whatever you want to call it. This

CHARLIE
He wants us to leave, Mr. Torrino.

Hello, Molly? This is Edie McKenna. Is he

Tom turns to her.

‘TOM
You calling Sam?

EDIE
Yeah.

Isn’t that overreacting?

No. Of course not.

Tom nods.

Sure. (Hands Sam the license) I thought I

Sam looks at the license, then walks back to his car. Aldo

to the car and hands Aldo the license.

Step out of the car, sir.

Aldo steps out.

Something I‘ve never told you....

TOM
My God. Did he....?

EDIE

No. Worse. My mother didn’t die in a car
crash visiting her sister.... She didn‘t
drive off the road. She parked the car in
front of that train. Parked it, Tom. She
couldn’t take it anymore. She couldn't
stop him from hurting us. She couldn’t
change him. I‘d just left for college...
I guess she was waiting until TI was
safely out of the house for good....

TOM
My God....

EDIE
Sam's father was sheriff then. He’d grown
up with my father, and he didn‘t want my
mother’s memory being destroyed by gossip
and scandal. He took care of it. But
Tom... As far as I'm concerned, my father
killed her. He left her no other choice,
no other exit. I don't want anything to
do with him, ever.

wearing the new shoes.

EDIE
I have to find my daughter.

SALESWOMAN
I‘m sorry, m’am. I can't let you leave
the store with those.

Edie kicks off the shoes in exasperation and walks briskly
out of the store. A hand grabs her shoulder and she whirls.

It’s Charlie, Torrino’s man. Edie gasps.

CHARLIE

EDIE
Oh my God. My daughter! Where is she?

Charlie nods, and Edie follows his look to see Sarah standing
outside the toy store, looking in the window. Torrino and
Aldo sit on a bench across from her. Edie walks to her

It's easy to get information on me. But
how does that old song go? “Believe half
of what you see and none of what you
hear”? That's good advice. It’s true T’ve
been on the wrong side of the law a few
times. I come from a tough town. Life
doesn’t always give us the choices we'd
like. But if you come to my neighborhood
and ask the people, they’1]l tell you it‘s
me they come to when they have problems,
not the police. You watch the news. You
know about big city police.

EDIE
t don’t have time for this.

TORRINO
I’m sorry. I’m an old man. It’s pretty
easy to drift off subject. I’1l keep this
brief. I have a little shop in South
Philadelphia. We sell cheeses from all
over the world. You’d like it, Mrs.
McKenna. Everybody comes there, and even
if they’re not buying, it’s a place to
come together with your friends and
neighbors. It makes me happy to own such
a place. It’s an essential part of the
community.

EDIE
What does this have to do with my
husband?

TORRINO
Your husband? I think your husband’s real
name is Joey Behan. He ran with a bad
group of kids. Troublemakers. He was what
you'd call the Alpha male these days. He
was really good at getting his friends to
da things for him. People like you and
me, Mrs. McKenna, we respect community.
We understand how important it is to have
a place where people can come together
and be part of a bigger thing. But not
Joey.

husband has nothing but respect for...

EDIE
Not that much, they don’t. Besides, Tom
grew up in Portland, Oregon.

TORRINO
Yes, yes. Of course. But Joey Behan
didn’t, and he and a little friend of
his, Richie Federici, decided one day
that what was mine should be theirs. It's
never been hard to get ahold of guns in
Philadelphia, and one evening, as we were
closing shop, Joey and his friend Richie
came in armed to the teeth.

EDIE
This is crazy.

TORRINO
Yes. It was crazy. SO crazy, nobody was
ready for it. Joey and his friend had no
compunction about firing wild. Five of my
friends were hit. Of the three who lived,
one of ‘em can't use his arm anymore.
Another is permanently brain damaged,
Mrs. McKenna, and TI started the day with
two good eyes, These two young men made
off with a very large sum of money, and
disappeared. Friends of mine, I have to
tell you,they wanted to spend a lot more
time looking. Me, I just wanted to get on
with my life. Learn from my mistakes and
move forward. Hut when I turned on my
television the other day and saw Joey
Behan staring me in the face, I knew T
had to do something. You say he’s the
wrong man. He‘s not Joey Behan. Perhaps
this is true. Anything’s possible. But
would you forget the man who took your
eye, Mrs. McKenna? I doubt it.

Edie looks at Torrino calmly for a long beat.

EDIE
Mr. Torrino, let me tell you how I’m
going to spend the rest of my day. I’m
going to take my daughter and we‘re going
to buy her a pair of new shoes. Then I’m
going to my office and calling Judge
Lane. He‘s the toughest judge in the
county, but he has a crush on me a mile
wide, and I’m going to push through a
restraining order against you and
your.... associates.

Torrino smiles.

TORRINO
No, Mrs. McKenna. You can’t. T want to

enchanting daughter.

Edie reaches out her hand to Sarah, who takes it. They turn

TOM
I don’t know how to do that, honey. He

Sarah looks at her mother, upset. Tom kneels by his daughter.

Tom runs into the closet, pulls out the rifle and the
shotgun, tears out of the room.

Tom leaps down the stairs and runs to the door. He puts the
rifle down against the wall, and, keeping the shotgun hidden,
he cracks the door cpen to find...

Hank.

TOM
Jesus. Hank.

HANK
vom. I’m sorry. Is this a bad time?

EDIE
Yes. Ir is.

Tom turns to see Edie standing behind him. Hank looks at her -
the first time he's made eye contact with his daughter in
more than fifteen years.

TOM
Hank. I...-

HANK
I just want to say something. Then I‘11
leave. Please, Fdie. Just this one time.

A long, uncomfortable beat, Tom stuck in between the two of

them. Edie glaring, Hank not breathing. Edie finally eases
back.

TOM

HANK

No. «« Tocan‘t,

 

He turns and stumbles to the dccr and steps cut. Tom looks at

Hank walks away from the house. Tom rushes up behind him and
gently takes his arm.

Hank turns to face him.

HANK

TOM
Then why the hell did you come all the

TOM
Yeah. She might. But at least she‘’1l

Hank looks at him thoughtfully.

INT. LIVING ROOM

Hank stands in front of Edie. She's still not giving him
anything. Tom hands him a glass of water, and he takes a long
sip, then puts the glass down on the mantle.

HANK
When I was growing up, we didn’t talk a
lot about how to be a man. It was just
something your daddy was supposed to pass
on to you. The things my daddy passed on
to me... Well, I guess it wasn’t enough.
Sure, it helped me make it through that
war, but nothing he taught me helped me
know how to make it back home. Your momma
did her best, Edie. She stood by me when
she should have taken you and just gone,
and I paid her back by treating her worse
than a dog. I can blame the booze, and I
can blame the war, but you want to know
the truth, it’s this - it ain’t none of
those things made me what I was. They
just opened the doors, and it was easier
to go through them than close ‘em. If I’d
loved her the way I should... If I'd
loved you the way I should.... I don’t
know.

Edie looks shaken at this.

HANK (cont'd)

We never were no kind of family. I was
like a lot of people. I never thought
much about what family meant. It’s
nothing more than a word and it don’t
mean shit unless you fill it with love
and commitment. You and Tom here... It
looks like you done that. I envy that. I

truly do.

EDIE
Hank... .?

HANK
Yeah?

EDIE

Why are you here?

HANK

I just wanted to tell you some things. I
want you to know I haven’t been sitting
around the last fifteen years telling
myself I’m some kind of victim. I know I
took the easy route, and I know I ain’t
even begun to pay for that, and I want
you to know that bad things do happen to
bad people, and if that's the case then
Maybe good things will happen to you and
yours.

A long beat. Nobody says anything.

HANK (cont'd)
That's really all. I know you‘re happy
here with this man. That makes me happy.
Not that that matters to you. It
shouldn’t matter to you. You done good,
Edie. You could have gone the easy road,
and you didn’t, and you prove that
sometimes good can come from bad. That‘s
all I want to say to you.

He gets up and walks to the door and opens it.

EDIE
Dad....

Hank stops, and a smile slowly spreads across his face. A
warm, beatific, loving smile.

Then something outside catches his eye. Hank whirls, and
grabs the shotgun from its place against the wall. But before
he can fully make it, a bullet slams into him, sending him
sprawling back onto the floor.

Edie and Tom flinch at the sound of the shot.

A beat ~ everything is frozen.

Hank holds himself up by the door, looking down in
dumbfounded surprise at the hole in his chest. He looks out
at the field, then falls to the ground, dead.

Tom snaps out of it first.

TOM

Edie is in shock. She doesn’t move.

Jom tackles her and drags her down again. She doesn’t even
seem to notice - she’s fixated on her father's body lying on
the floor.

TOM
Edie! Stay down.

She looks at him blankly.

EDIE
That’s my daddy.

Tom shakes her hard. Her eyes seem to re-focus, and she looks
at Tom, confused.

EDIE (cont’d)
Tom?

TOM
Edie. You have to stay down.

She looks around, looks at her father, then at the open door.

TOM (cont‘d)
Stay here.

He scrambles across the floor to the door ~ the rifle leans
against the wall next to the shotgun.

He grabs the rifle and slams the door closed ~ but Hank’s in
the way. Tom doesn’t let himself look at the dead man, but
scrambles back across the floor, rifle in hand.

He makes it to the window and carefully peers out, ready for
anything.

Except what he sees.

Jesus Christ.

Edie crawls over to him.

EDIE

EXT. MCKENNA HOUSE

Torrino, Aldo and Charlie stand out at the edge of the field.
Charlie has a rifle in his hand. Aldo has his hands on the
shoulders of Jack, who looks terrified.

TORRINO
Joey. Come out. Let's end this now and
nobody else will get hurt.

A long beat, and then Tom appears in the door, rifle in one
hand, shotgun in the other.

‘TOM
Let my son’ go.

TORRINO
Come down here, Joey. Let’s talk.

TOM
My name is not Joey. You have the wrong
man. You have my son. You‘re trespassing.

Torrino shakes his head.

TORRINO
You know I'm a serious man, Joey. You‘ve
seen what I’m willing to do. Stop the
game.

Tom whips the rifle up and aims.

TOM
This isn’t a game, you son of a bitch!

He fires, hitting the propane tank, which EXPLODES, shooting
fire everywhere, sending Torrino, his men and Jack sprawling
to the ground. Aldo takes the brunt of it, his back
protecting Jack.

Tom dives to the ground, rifle in hand.

TOM (cont'd)
Jack! Runt

Jack scrambles to his feet, and Tom fires at Charlie and
Torrino, covering his son. Jack makes it to the field, dives
into the corn, vanishing.

Charlie and Torrino fire wildly at the house. Tom hits the
ground and rolls off the side of the porch.

INT. LIVING ROOM

Edie curls up on the floor, screaming as bullets slam into
the walls and the furniture.

SARAH (0.S.}
Mommy?

EDIE
Stay down, baby! Mommy’s coming! But stay
down!

She crawls towards the stairs.
EXT. MCKENNA HOUSE

Tom crouches by the side of the house, rifle in hand. He
checks the load - one bullet left. He peers up at the porch,
sees the shotgun lying there, and frowns. A bullet zings past
his face, and he dives back, scrambles behind the house.

The circle of fire where the tank was is expanding. The field
is starting to burn.

Charlie and Torrino crouch down. Torrino nods towards Aldo,
who lays face down, his back ripped to shreds, on fire.
Charlie shakes his head - “no.” Torrino grimaces. He points
to the other side of the house, gestures for Charlie to head
that way. Charlie scuttles off.

Behind the house, Tom straightens up, back to the wall, and
slides towards the other side of the house.

He creeps around the corner, alongside the porch, and looks
up. The shotgun’s gone.

Charlie creeps around the side of the porch and bumps right
into Tom. The two men scramble to bring their guns up, but
they‘re in too tight. Tom drops the rifle and goes for
Charlie‘s throat.

The two men roll on the ground, pounding the shit out of each
other. Tom bites Charlie’s hand hard, until blood squirts
out. Charlie screams in pain. Tom rolls on top of him and
punches his throat hard, over and over.

Charlie chokes and gurgles and dies. Tom keeps pounding.
Tom cries out in pain as a bullet tears through his shoulder,
knocking him forward. He rolls over to find Torrino standing

over him, gun in hand, glaring in rage. Torrino cocks his gun
and points it right at Tom‘s head.

TORRINO
You have anything to say before T kill
you, you miserabie prick?

Tom stares back, hatred in his eyes, clutching his wounded
shoulder.

TOM
I should have killed you back in Philly.

Torrino smiles, relieved. Finally!
Tom clenches his jaw, ready for the shot.
BLAM!

Blood splatters all over Tom as Torrino’s chest explodes.
Torrino staggers forward and falis to the ground. Tom rolls
out of the way and sees Jack standing there, a dazed look on
his face, the shotgun in his hands.

Tom staggers towards Jack and takes the shotgun from him.
Jack is frozen, non-responsive. He just stares at the dead
man on the ground.

Edie steps out the front door, Sarah in her arms, and walks
briskly towards her husband and son.

EDIE
Oh my God. Tom? Are you okay? Is it over?
Is it over?

She rushes over and hugs her her son tight.

Tom stands, looking at his family for a moment. Edie looks
back at him, a mixture of conflicting emotions on her face,
but mostly anger. Tom hesitantly steps toward them, then
takes them all in his arms. Outside, the fire in the field
rages.

In the distance, sirens.
EXT. MCKENNA HOUSE - LATER

A fire truck parked in the field, FIREMEN putting out the
last of the fire.

Tom sits on the back of an ambulance as the Paramedic
bandages his shoulder, Sam is questioning him as Edie stands
by, stili holding the dazed Sarah. Jack Stands off in the
distance, jooking at the spot where Torrino lay.

Tom nods. Sam turns to Edie.

She looks at Sam and smiles faintly in gratitude.

Tom lays back on the stretcher.

Edie climbs in and sits beside him, a distant look on her
face. She holds his hand, but doesn’t look at him. The
ambulance takes off.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

Tom lays in the bed in the dark, staring at the ceiling. The
door opens, and Edie walks in. He reaches out to her.

TOM
Bdie.... Honey... Are you okay?

She steps back, away from him.

EDIE
Tell me the truth.

Tom looks at her a long beat, then hangs his head.

TOM
You heard.

EDIE
No. I saw. Those men... Torrino... He
wasn’t wrong. You're the man he was
looking for. You’re Joey Behan. That’s
your real name. You didn’t grow up in
Portland. And you never talked about your
adopted parents because you didn’t have
any. You killed men.... You killed them

Shit! Whoever you are! The lie is over.
It's dead. I want to know the truth right
now.

TOM
Edie....

She glares at him, furious.

TOM (cont'd}
My brother Steve and I... he was older
than me.... we were raised in an
orphanage in Philadelphia. When he got
old enough to leave, Steve ran errands
for Torrino. I guess he thought it was a
way into being a player some day. Torrino
found out Steve was skimming off some of
his runs. Steve... Steve was the only
family I'd ever had. Torrino... He’s
exactly what he looks like, Edie. Guys
like him, they kill you over nothing.
Cops found Steve in a dumpster. Everyone
knew who it was, but nobody could prove
anything. You never can. Richie Federici
was my best friend, a year younger than
me... He loved Steve, toa. I came up with
the idea of hitting Torrino's cheese
shop... Get some payback. Make it look
like a robbery.

EDIE
Make it look like.... You were going to
kill then.

TOM
He killed my brother, Edie. We got some
guns... That wasn't hard. And we waited

Torinno and a few guys in the back,

how we used to say we‘d never lie to each
other? That's all we're going to do from
here on out. I‘m not going to let you
tear this family apart. So you be Tom,
I'll be Edie, and maybe someday it‘1l
start to feel real again, You can’t live
with that, you leave right now.

Tom nods.

EXT. TRAIN TRACKS - DUSK

Jack (cont‘d)

He chucks the bottle. She sits down next to fim.
JUDY
Want to smoke a joint?
JACK
Nah. Thanks.
Judy shrugs and lights up, takes a deep hit. They sit in
silence for a long beat.
JUDY
So Mr. Beezer said “Shit” today.
JACK
Beezer?
JUDY
Yeah, He slammed his thumb with a hammer
in class.
JACK
Beezer never curses.
Jupy
Right. I know. We're all, like, whoa!
Dude!
Jack nods.

Jack smiles faintly. Judy smiles back, warmly. She puts her
arm around him, and he buries his head in her shoulder.

EXT. CEMETARY - DUSK

A PRIEST stands over an open grave, lowering a casket into
the ground as Edie stands by watching, holding Sarah’s hand.
Tom stands alongside them. Except for the GRAVEDIGGER off to
the side, there’s nobody else there.

INT. TOM AND EDIE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Edie sleeps on one side. Tom, on the other, stares at the

ceiling, uncomfortable in his own bed. He finally rolls over
and closes his eyes.

FADE TO:
BLACK.
A phone rings.

TOM
Hello?

MAN’S VOICE (0.8.)
Help me, Joey....

INT. TOM AND EDIE‘S BEDROOM — NIGHT

Tom sits on the side of the bed, shaken to the core. Edie
sits up behind him.

EDIE
What is it, Tom?
TOM
Richie’s alive.
EDIE
What?
TOM
Fe... I don‘t know how... He must have

gotten away from them.

EDIE
Tom, what the hell are you talking about?

TOM
Richie, Edie. Richie is still alive. They
didn’t kill him.

EDIE
That’s good, isn’t it?

TOM

No. I mean, yes. But... Dammit. Dammit to
hell.

EDIE
what?

TOM
They have him, Edie. They found him.

EDIE
Torrino'’s dead, Tom. Who’s “they”?

TOM
Torrino's friends. His organization.
They must have tracked down Richie, too.

EDIE
How, Tom? Finding you makes sense, but
have you seen Richie on the evening news
in the last few days? Did he change his
name, too? Are you even listening to
yourself?

TOM
IT don’t know. It doesn’t matter, All that
matters is that it isn’t over yet.

EDIE
No, it's over.

TOM
Richie has a wife and kids, too. They
said they were going to...

EDIE
I don’t want to hear it.

TOM
Edie. I have to deal with this.

EDIE
No, you don't. You’re Tom, not Joey.

TOM
Do you want to spend the rest of our
lives running and hiding from these
people? Edie, listen to me. They have
Richie. They're going to kill him and his
family unless....

EDIE

Unless what?
TOM

Unless I go to them.
EDIE

So they can kill you?
TOM

That's what they want.
EDIE

What are you going to do?
TOM

Edie, 1 have to go.
EDIE

To die?
TOM

No, To put an end to this-

EDIE
What does that mean, Tom?

Tom gets up and starts to get dressed.

EDIE (cont'd)
Tom, what does that mean?

TOM
It means I have to go.

EDIE
Goddammit, Tom. You can't.

TOM
For twenty years I've run from this. I
let my best friend die. I thought I
couldn't do a thing to stop it, but now
it turns out T can-

EDIE
And make yourself feel better in the
bargain..

TOM
Dammit, Edie, it's not about me. I[t‘s
not about feeling better about what
happened. It's about fixing something I
did.

EDIE
You don‘t have to do it.

TOM
Yeah, I do. I have to.

EDIE
So you’1l give up your family for that?

‘TOM
Is that what it means?

EDIE
That's what it means.

Tom frowns and buttons his shirt. He turns to her.

 

‘TOM
When they've done something that’s so bad
they can’t live with it, some people end
it all, They just shut off, they kill
themselves, or get lost in drugs or
booze... Others... We just shut it out,
we push it aside, as far as we can, every
time until it stops coming. I thought it
had gone away forever, Edie. I thought
that so many of my cells had died and
been replaced that I'd become someone
else completely, and I guess even that's
a lie, because the truth is, I didn’t
think about it at all. I'd buried it.
Until this happened. And that’s when I
learned that it'd never gone away. It’s
always been there, just waiting for a
chance to come out. The only way I can
bury it, the only way I can be Tom
McKenna and stay Tom McKenna is to face
this thing and kill it.

EDIE

That’s just bullshit, Tom. All you have
4 to do is choose.

TOM
There’s no choice for me.

EDIE
We won't be here when you get back.

TOM
I hope you are.

He walks out of the room without looking back. Edie drops
onto the bed, slightly in shock. She reaches over to turn on
the lamp, and it flickers off and on. She shakes it, but it
doesn't do anything. In a flash of rage, she lashes out,
slamming the lamp against the wall, where it shatters.

EXT. McKENNA HOUSE

The barn in the back. Tom opens the doors and goes inside.
There’s a roar of an engine, and a moment later, a big,
battered pickup drives out. He swerves around the station
wagon and disappears down the road.

EXT. PHILADELPHIA ~ NIGHT

The city looks alive at night. The skyline is brightly lit
and beautiful. Tom ~ let’s call him Joey now, because that’s
who he is - sits in the shadows of the steps of the Art
Museum looking over it. It’s been a long time. His hair’s
scruffy and he hasn‘t shaved in a couple days.

A loud roar, and two souped up cars blast past the museum, a
late night street race. Joey smiles faintly in recognition
and stands, heads down the stairs to his truck.

EXT. CAFE DES ARTISTES ~ NIGHT

A corner restaurant in the middle of the city. Joey walks up
to it and leoks at the sign hanging outside. He walks in.

INT. CAFE DES ARTISTES

A nice boho kind of joint. College kids and young urban
professionals enjoy vegetarian meals in a delicate, pretty
decor. A maitre'd approaches him.

MAITRE'’D
How many in your party, sir?

JOEY
What happened to Murph’s?

MAITRE‘D
Sir?

Christ, I mean, forever. Since the
forties, at least.

MAITRE'D
Oh, Murphy's. They were shut down at
least six years ago.

JOEY
For what?

MAITRE’D
They were serving minors.

Joey shakes his head.

JOEY
Yeah, that figures.

MAITRE’D
Will you be having dinner, sir?

JOEY
No. I don’t think so. Thanks.

He stops, then turns back.

JOEY {cant’d)
Track and Turf still around?

MAITRE‘D
That place on 45th? Yeah. I think so.

Joey nods and walks out.
INT. TRACK AND TURF - LATER

A real dive bar. A broken neon sign in the window reads
"Track & Turf” backwards. A battered old bar in the middle. A
few booths, a couple tables with mismatched old chairs.

A decent sized, albeit ratty crowd fills the place. Joey
walks in and looks around. He looks in the corner and sees @
decrepit old slide bowling machine and smiles. He walks to
the bar and sits. The bartender walks over to him.

JOEY
Genny Cream.

The bartender puts a bottle in front of Joey, who takes a

long pull and looks around the place. He spots a MAN sitting
in a booth in the back and gets up and walks over to him.

SOEY (cont'd)

MAN
Ruben? Shit. Ruben’s been dead for ten

Joey nods and turns to walk away.

on.

JOEY
Yeah?

The man nods. Joey sits down across from him.

JOEY (cont ’d)
I'm looking to buy.

MAN
You bought from Ruben?

JOEY
Yeah. Once. Long time ago.

MAN
What you lookin’ for?

JOEY
I don't know. Something in a semi-
automatic. I need two of them. Major
stopping nower. And ammo. Couple more
items. I need to see what you’ve got.

The man nods.

JCEY
Do I look like a cop?

Shit. You look like a farmer on vacation.

Joey smiles.

EXT. TORRINO’S CHEESE SHOP ~ NIGHT
Joey stands across the street, in the shadows, looking at the

old cheese shop. He pulls a gun out of his jacket, cocks it,
and walks determinedly towards the store.

INT. TORRINO'S CHEESE SHOP
An OLD MAN stands behind the counter, wrapping a large block
of cheese in wax paper with one hand. Except for him, the

store is empty.

The door slams open and Joey barrels in, gun in hand, face
grim.

The Old Man flinches, but doesn't look up.

OLD MAN
You'd be Joey Behan.

JORY
T am.

The Old Man continues wrapping, not making eye contact with
Joey.

OLD MAN
You're in the wrong place.

JOEY
Where are they keeping Richie?

OLD MAN
You know the old beach house?

JOEY
The one in Surf City?

The Old Man nods.

JOEY (cont'd)
You got the address?

The old man puts down the block of cheese, picks up a pencil
and writes the address down on a piece of brown paper. Joey
notices that his other arm doesn’t seem to work.

JOEY (cont'd)
How many men there?

OLD MAN
Ain't more than five of them leit.

JOEY
Torrino’s gone, you know.

OLD MAN
I know.

Joey nods towards the man's dead arm.

JOEY
What happened to your arm?

The Old Man turns to face Joey for the first time.

OLD MAN
You know, Joey.

Joey’s jaw tightens. He takes the piece of paper and nods

grimly, walks out of the shop. The Old Man goes back to his
‘cheese.

EXT. SURF CITY STREET - DAWN

Waves crash on the beach as the sun peeks over the horizon.
Joey's truck is pulled over by the side of the road.

INT. JOEY’S TRUCK

Joey sits in the driver seat, sipping coffee from a “World’s
Greatest Dad” mug. He's fully strapped ~ crisscrossing
underarm holsters with guns. A huge knife in a strap-on
holster sits next to him. He finishes the coffee, slips the
strap on around his leg under his pants, and puts a jacket on
over the holsters. He gets out.

EXT. BEACH HOUSE

B big old beach house sits at the edge of the dunes. It's
seen better days. Three or four cars are parked at random
angles in the driveway. A large man in a football jersey -

Thug #1 ~ stands by the front door, casually keeping an eye
out.

Ke hears a slight scuffling noise and whirls, producing a gun
out of nowhere. Nothing.

He eases back just as Joey appears behind him, knife in hand.
Joey whips a hand over the man’s mouth and slams the knife
into his back again and again. Thug #1 sags to the ground.
doey watches him drop, blood staining his jacket. He turns to
the house.

INT. BEACH HOUSE

THUG #2 and #3 sit around a coffee table, drinking coffee,
guns sitting in front of them. Thug #2 reads a paper.

THUG #2
You ever read the funnies?

THUG #3
Not anymore. Nothing funny left.

THUG #2
Ain‘t that the goddam truth. I can’t
believe how bad this Cathy shit is,
Someone should strangle this bitch.

The front door opens.

THUG #2 (cont'd)

Yo, Marvin. What’s up, You‘re supposed
tow...

They look up and see Joey standing there, a gun in each hand.
The two men scramble for their guns, but Joey fires first.
Thug #2 goes down in a spray of blood.

Thug #3 dives to the floor, knocking the table over. The

coffee, cups, newspaper and guns crash to the floor and he
scrambles for a gun.

Joey moves quickly and leaps on the man’s back, slams his gun
in his ear.

JOEY
Where‘s Richie?

THUG #3
Downstairs. We got a basement. He's down
there.

Joey nods.

JOEY
I'm sorry about this,

THUG #3
Fuck you.

BLAM!
INT, BASEMENT

THUG #4 leans against a wall, gun in hand, waiting. The
basement door slams open and something crashes down. Thug #4
whips out from behind the wall blasting. He steps out to see
that he‘s shot the hell out of an old armchair.

THUG #4
Shit.

Joey pops up in the basement door and blasts away, nailing
the Thug.

Joey cautiously creeps down the stairs, ready for anything.
He‘s stained with the blood of the men he's killed.

He steps down into the dark basement and looks around. Hits
switch on the wall and the lights go on. The basement is
empty. He hears a sound, and looks ~ across the room is a
door leading into a smaller area.

Joey cautiously steps towards it.
JOEY
Alright. Whoever’s in there... Come on
out.

A long beat. Then....

MAN'S VOICE (0.S.}
Joey?

JOEY
Richie?

MAN‘S VOICE (0.S.}
Joey! Help me. I'm all alone in here,

Joey cautiously approaches the door. Takes a deep breath and
pushes it open.

INT. BASEMENT - SMALL ROOM

RICHIE, a gcod looking man the same age as Joey, sits on a
chair in the middle of the room, his hands tied behind his
back. Joey steps in, gun in hand.

JOEY
Jesus. Richie.

Joey! Oh my God. Joey!

JOEY
How many here?

RICHIE
What? Those guys? Just four.

JOEY
I was expecting five.

RICHIE
I dunno. I only know four. Jesus, Joey!
You came! Untie met!

Joey holsters his guns and walks over to Richie and leans

down.

Except Richie‘s hands aren't tied.

Richie whips out a gun and points it at Joey’s head. Joey

freezes.

RICHIE (cont'd)
Oh, yeah. There were five.

Richie stands up, gun still pointed.

RICHTE (cont‘d)
I knew you'd come, Didn‘t think you'd
make it this far, though. I was hoping
for a little less bloodshed, Joey. Jesus,
you're good with the killing, aren’t you?

Joey glares at him.

RICHIE (cont’d}
Why do you think that is? You think it's
genetic? You think your old man was some
kind of killer? Or is it just chance?

JORY
They didn’t track you down,

RICHIE
Oh, hell no. i've always been here, Joey.
Right here where you left me.

JOEY
What happened?

103.
CONTINUED: (2)

RICHTE
Do you have any idea what it takes to
talk one of these wiseguy fucks out of
killing you?

Joey shakes his head.

RICHIE (cont'd)
I told him the whole story, man. I told
him how you talked me out of going away
to school so I could help you kill him.
He liked that loyalty thing, you know? He
liked that I’d give up what I wanted for
a friend, Joey. Or Tom. You prefer Tom?
You’re starting to look like a Tom, you
know? Yeah, well, anyway, after a while,
he started letting me do some work for
him. Made me do the dirtiest goddam jobs
he had. Lots of fun shit. I got good at
it, too. You wouldn't believe how easy it
is to just slide into Bad. Oh, hell.
Yeah, you would.

Joey doesn’t respond.

RICHIE (cont‘d)
You got nothing to say? Huh? You just
gonna sit there and listen?

He steps forward and smacks Joey in the head with the butt of
the gun, Joey's head snaps back, but he doesn’t say anything.

RICHIE (cont'd)
Hey! I’m talkin’ here!

He smacks him again, this time drawing blood. Joey wipes the
blood from his forehead and responds quietly and evenly.

JOEY
I‘m listening.

RICHIE
Yeah. You better. You fuckin’ better.

He steps back and composes himself a beat.

RICHIE (cont'd)
All that really matters is that it got to
the point where Torrino actually trusted
me, and when you bumped the old man, that
left me in charge of what was left of his
shit.

York guys, start over at the bottom. Like
I don’t owe you for enough as it is.
Goddam you, Joey. I could have had a real
life. I was going to go to fucking
college, man. Guys like us, how many of
us make it that far? You did this, Joey.
you did this to my life.

Joey steps toward Richie.

JOEY
I guess I kinda knew some of that. They
just found you out of the blue, the same
time they found me? Didn’t make sense.

RICHIE
Then why’d you come back?
JOEY
I came here to save you.
RICHIE
You missed your chance a long time ago.
e Joey steps closer. Richie raises the gun, pointing it at his
head.
JOEY

X thought I could live with what I‘d done
to you, Richie. In the end, I couldn't. I
wanted to believe I could save you, but I
guess this'll have to do.

He sticks his forehead up against the barrel of Richie’s gun.

JCEY (cont'd)
You do what you have to.

RICHIE
I want you to beg for me.

JOEY
Not gonna happen. Just end it.

RICHIE

bloom to her. I think I'11 fuck her
before I kill her. How about that? You

Without warning, Joey whips his head to the left, causing
Richie’s gun to slide forward, past his head. Richie staggers
forward, and grunts in surprise. The gun goes off, but Joey
knocks it out of his hand with his free hand.

Richie slowly looks down and sees Joey‘s other hand - it’s
wrapped around the knife sticking into Richie’s belly. Richie
staggers back, clutching the knife, blood gushing. Joey
calmly pulls out one of his guns and points it at Richie.

JOEY
I‘m willing to kill for that, Richie.

EXT. BEACH HOUSE

Joey walks towards the beach, battered and blood soaked. He
walks down to the edge of the water and hurls his revolvers
as far as they'll go. We takes the bloody knife out of its
holster and throws it after them. He tears off the knife

holster and the underarm holsters and throws them into the

sea as well.

He rips his bloody shirt off and throws it in after the
weapons, then falls to the sand and sits, staring out as the
sun rises over the horizon, water lapping closer and closer
to his feet.

He sits a long, long time.

EXT. MCKENNA HOUSE ~ DUSK

Tom’s pickup pulls up in front of the house. Tom gets out and
looks at the house, sees the station wagon parked in front.

The field has been cleaned up, all remnants of the propane
tank are gone.

Tom walks to the front door and opens it.

INT. LIVING ROOM

Empty. Tom hears a sound in another room, and heads for the
kitchen.

INT. KITCHEN

Edie sits at the head of the table, dishing out dinner to
Jack and Sarah. Jack and Sarah look up when he walks in, then
go back to their meals. Edie doesn't look up. Tom stands in
the doorway a long beat, then sits in his chair.

A long beat as the family eats. Tom looks around at his
family, who don’t return his look, He closes his eyes and
fights back the tears. Sarah looks around the table, at her
mother and brother, then her father. She’s thinking hard.

Sarah gets up and walks over to the counter and picks up a
plate and some silverware and puts them in front of her
father, her face very straight. Tom looks at her, his eyes
wet, and smiles. She shoots him an uncertain smile, then goes
back to her seat.

Jack, chewing his dinner, looks at the serving plate in the
middle of the table. He swallows, then pushes the plate over
in front of his father, not making eye contact. Tom smiles in
gratitude.

He looks across the table at Edie, who stares intently at the
food in front of her.

After a lang beat, she looks up at her husband, her face
impassive. He looks back, no idea what she‘s thinking, no
idea what the future holds. But he sees something in her
eyes, and for now, that’s enough.

There's hope.
