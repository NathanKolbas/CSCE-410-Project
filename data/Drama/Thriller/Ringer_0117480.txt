FADE IN:
INT. OFFICE — DAY

A mass of non descript cubicles. In the distance, we hear a
VOICE. Someone chanting to himself, nervous.

VOICE
I've been with this company two
years... I’ve been with this

company two and a half years...

The CAMERA pushes. through the maze of tiny cubicles trying to
find the disembodied voice, past WORKERS routinely going
through their daily grind. We finally find the man behind
the voice.

STEVE BARKER

A pleasant looking guy in his early 30's, who’s been
overlooked his entire life. But not anymore. Not today.
Steve drums his fingers nervously, takes a deep breath, then
gets up from his cubicle.

He walks down a series of hallways leading to a large,
formidable looking office. He knocks on the door and walks
inside.

INT. MR. HENDERSON'S OFFICE - DAY

MR. HENDERSON, a distinguished looking man in his 50's, is
sitting at his desk. He glances coldly up at Steve when he
finally notices him. :

MR. HENDERSON
Can I help you?

STEVE
Sir, I’ve been with this company
for two and a half years, and all
I've really done is some clerical
crap and... well, I think I’m ready
for more responsibility.

MR. HENDERSON
I see. What exactly are you basing
that on?

STEVE
I'm basing it on the fact I know I
can perform. I just need a chance.

Mr. Henderson looks at him, a bit impressed.

(CONTINUED)

 

 
 

CONTINUED : : . .

 

MR. HENDERSON
Okay, Barker... What kind of
responsibility are you looking for?

STEVE
(surprised)
I don’t know. A better job than I
have now. Something in management.

MR. HENDERSON
We don’t just hand oyt managerial
promotions, Barker. This isn’t
Coca Cola. . :

Mr. Henderson laughs pretentiously. Steve laughs along,
though he has absolutely no idea what that means.

MR. HENDERSON (CONT'D)
I‘ll tell you what. Today’s your
lucky day. I'm gonna give you a
chance to prove your chops.

STEVE
Thank you, Mr. Henderson.

( MR. HENDERSON
I want you to fire Pedro.

Steve looks at him, not understanding.

STEVE
The janitor?

MR. HENDERSON
I caught him using my personal
bathroom. .

STEVE
Uh... maybe it was an emergency.

MR. HENDERSON
He knows better, Barker. He should
have shown some restraint.

STEVE

I’m sure he tried as hard as he
could, sir.

MR. HENDERSON
It’s not just that. Look! I came
in this morning and my basket was
full of trash. . No, I’m sorry, he's
out of here.

Mr. Henderson presses his intercom.

MR. HENDERSON (CONT’D)
Peggy, tell Pedro Mr. Barker would
like to see him.

Steve looks at Mr. Henderson a ‘little uncertainly.

STEVE
Uh, Jesus... I don’t know.

MR. HENDERSON
Do you want to be a manager or not?

Mr. Henderson stares at Steve. Steve sighs.
INT. TRASH ROOM - DAY

Steve walks into a small trash room in the back of the
office. PEDRO, a Giminutive, sad looking, middle aged
Hispanic man is emptying a few trash baskets.

STEVE
Hey, Pedro...

PEDRO
(looks up, thick accent)
Oh. You want to see me, Mr. Steve?

STEVE
That’s right, I, uh... Pedro, you
don’t really like: your job, do, you?

PEDRO
Oh. yes. I like very much! I get
to clean things. Work with my
hands.

STEVE
Yeah, but you'd be happier doing
something else, right? I mean,
you‘re a pretty bright guy.

PEDRO
No... not really.

(CONTINUED)
 

CONTINUED :

 

STEVE
Of course you are, Pedro! You just
have a bit of ‘a language problem.

PEDRO
No, no, senor, in my country, Pedro
not too bright either.

STEVE / :
Look, trust me. You’re wasting
your time here...

PEDRO
(eyes wide, getting it)
Oh, no. Oh, no. Pedro can’t be
fired, Pedro can't be fired. Pedro
has eight kids. Pedro’s wife just
died.

STEVE
Your wife...? Oh god, I’m sorry.

PEDRO
I miss so much. Pedro wants to

. 4 give Maria nice funeral, not just
i . put her in box. I love so --
Pedro leans forward and starts to sob uncontrollably.
STEVE
(closes his eyes)
Look, uh... Pedro, I’m not firing
you.
PEDRO
(looking up)
No?
STEVE
I'm offering you something else. A
better job.
PEDRO
Pedro listening.
STEVE
(trying to think)
How would you like to... mow the
lawn at my apartment complex?

PEDRO

STEVE
Uh, I’‘1l give you... four hundred.

PEDRO
Wow. And health benefits?

STEVE
I don’t think --

PEDRO
Please, Mr. Steve. Pedro needs
health benefits. Pedro has many

kids.

STEVE
Yeah, yeah. You got health
benefits.

Pedro shakes Steve's hand enthusiastically.

INT. MR. HENDERSON'S OFFICE — DAY

Mr. Henderson looks out his office door and sees Steve
walking by. He runs over to him.

MR. HENDERSON
How did it go? Did you sack the
guy? .

STEVE
Uh, yes I did, sir.

MR. HENDERSON
Welcome to management, Barker!
From now on, you get that cubicle
over there.

Mr. Henderson points to a slightly bigger cubicle a few feet
away. Steve stares at it, eyes glazed.
 

 

 

 

EXT. STEVE'S APARTMENT — THE NEXT MORNING

Steve is standing on the lawn outside of his huge apartment
complex with Pedro. A sexy neighbor, SARAH, walks by,
carrying her mail. Steve smiles at her.

STEVE
Hi, Sarah.

SARAH
Hey...

She smiles weakly. _ She obviously doesn’t know his name.

STEVE

So, you got your mail there?
SARAH

Uh... yeah.
STEVE

Anything good?

SARAH
{looks at him, beat)
I don’t know. I haven't opened it
yet.

STEVE
Rignt...
(way too abruptly)
Wanna go out?

SARAH
(quickly)
I have to feed my cat.

She walks quickly away. Steve winces. Pedro walks over to
Steve, impatient.

PEDRO
Pedro get to use a lawnmower now?

STEVE
Yeah, 1 think there’s one in back.

Steve walks to a little shed in the back of the Rental
Office. He grabs the first lawnmower he can find and hands
it to Pedro.

STEVE (CONT'D)
There you go.

(CONTINUED)
 

 

CONTINUED:

Pedro takes the lawnmower, happily makes his way back to the
lawn, and starts to mow.

NEIL GOLDMAN, the apartment manager, stares out the window of
the rental office. He walks quickly out to the lawn.

NEIL
(to Steve)
What’s going on here?

STEVE
I hired him to do the lawn.

NEIL
What are you talking about? You’re
a tenant. You don’t have the
authority to hire someone.

STEVE
Well, the lawn was getting pretty
sloppy...
NEIL
You're a tenant! You can‘t hire ;
anyone!

Steve pulls Neil aside.

STEVE
Look, take it easy, will you, I’m
paying him out of my own pocket.

NEIL
What?

STEVE
I’m paying him out of my pocket.
It's my dime.

NEIL
(confused)
Okay... whatever.

Neil walks away, still a little puzzled. Pedro whistles and
continues to mow the lawn. : .

INT. STEVE’S APARTMENT — NIGHT
teve is sitting in front of his miniscule Tv, sloppily

eating some fries. He’s watching an episode of "Family Guy,”
laughing away in a high pitched, idiotic cackle.

- Even though it’s evening now, we can still hear the sound of

the lawnmower going outside. Steve gets up and looks out his
window. . :

STEVE
{calling out)
Pedro, you can go home!

PEDRO (0.S.)
No done yet! .

Steve shakes his head with admiration and sits back down.
Suddenly, he hears a loud SCREAM outside. Drops of blood
splatter on his window as a FINGER flies by. Steve is
concerned.

CUT TO:
INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT
Pedro runs through the emergency doors of a hospital,
holding his hand,. in agony. Steve runs in right behind him,
holding three of Pedro’s fingers in a bag packed with ice.

CUT TO:

INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM — NIGHT

waiks urgently into the waiting room.

DOCTOR
Who's Mr. Rodriguez’s employer?
STEVE
(jumps up)
Me.
DOCTOR .
Good news. We can save his
fingers.
STEVE
Great --
DOCTOR
Now, what health plan is he on?

going to need the cash up front. |
STEVE

Twenty eight thousand dollars.

STEVE

I don’t have that kind of money!
DOCTOR
: Well, I'm sorry... We can't do the

surgery.
STEVE
What? That’s ridiculous! t
DOCTOR :
. Sir, this is the real world, not
“E.R.” You don’t have insurance :
| \ and you don’t have any funds.
| / |
( Steve looks at him, frantic.

| DOCTOR (CONT’D)

We can keep his fingers on ice for
two weeks. Not a day longer.
After that... I’m afraid there’s
nothing we can do.

CUT TO: -
INT. STEVE’S OFFICE — THE NEXT DAY
Steve is sitting in front of Mr. Henderson.

MR. HENDERSON
The answer is no.

STEVE
But... Pedro was an employee
yesterday! Can’t our medical
insurance still cover him?

MR. HENDERSON
I said no.

STEVE
But... why not? It’s just one
day.

MR. HENDERSON
(isn’t it obvious)
Well, see, I'd be knowingly
breaking the rules.

Steve looks at him, incredulous.

Steve thin

A beat.

STEVE
Please, sir, he’s in the hospital
right now. He’s in agony. He has
three fingers on ice. They’re not
gonna last long! I’m begging you.
Please. Have a heart.

MR. HENDERSON
Hey, hey! I give six hundred
dollars every year to help fight
M.S. .Don‘t talk to me about heart.

ks for a second.

STEVE .
How about this? If you cover him
for the fingers, you could dock it
out of my pay.

MR. HENDERSON
(thinks about this)
What's the bill?

STEVE
Twenty eight grand.

MR. HENDERSON
What? Jesus, if I took every one
of your checks, I wouldn't get back
my money for like nine months...
and who knows if you're even gonna
be here that long?

STEVE
What’s that supposed to mean?

MR. HENDERSON
I’m just spitballing. Relax.

GARY BARKER, (late 40’s, early 50’s) a hyper, unkempt guy,

TVs mounted high up against the wall.

GARY
C'mon, Garciaparra. Hit it out!

GARY
What do you need 1500 for?

STEVE
Actually, I need 28 grand. I'm

GARY
28 grand?... What did you do,

No, no, it’s just a personal thing.
My friend lost his fingers and...

BIG TONY
You know something? You talk too

Big Tony leans forward and punches Gary hard in the throat.
Gary keels over, gagging, in agony. FRANKIE, a mobster a few
tables away, looks up at a TV, excited.

FRANKIE

STONE PHILLIPS (V.0O.)
His name is Jimmy Washington. But

Gary and Steve are walking towards a sign-up booth. Steve
looks around at all the athletes on the field. He starts to
breathe heavily. After a few seconds, he’s practically
hyperventilating.

STEVE
I’m sorry, I’m sorry. I'm out of

Steve turns around and bumps into someone.

WOMAN (O.S.)
Is something wrong?

Gary and Steve.look up. Standing in front of them is LYNN
SHERIDAN, a beautiful Volunteer in her early 30’s who
radiates goodness.

. . GARY
f ‘ Uh, Jeffy’s just nervous...

Steve looks up at her and, for a moment, is speechless.
She’s the most beautiful woman he’s ever seen. If there’s
such a thing as love at first sight, this is it.

LYNN
There’s no need to be nervous,
Jetfy. .
Lynn moves closer to him, smiling.

LYNN (CONT’D)
Hi, I'm Lynn. Nice to meet you.

Steve just stares at her, smitten.
LYNN (CONT’D)
What‘s the matter? Cat got your

LYNN
Are you his sponsor?
GARY
Yean. It’s a thankless job, but --
LYNN
Do you have his medical records?

Huh?
; LYNN
7 3 His records. We require medical
q - records for all the athletes.
GARY

Oh, his medical records. You know

what? I left them in my other car.
(lame laugh)

I swear, sometimes I think I'm

retarded.

Lynn gives him a bit of a dirty look.

GARY (CONT'D)
Look, it’ll take me hours to get
them. And just look at this little
guy. He has his heart set on
competing. Don’t you, Jeffy?

. STEVE
Go for gold!

Lynn looks at Jeffy for a beat. She sighs.

talk, a little nervous.

LYNN (CONT'D)

What specifically is his condition?

GARY
His condition?
(thinks)
He's... real slow. And he wets

Lynn just looks at him. A few feet away, Steve winces,
eavesdropping on their conversation. AN ATHLETE and his
SPONSOR stand beside Steve in front of the beverage cooler.
Steve smiles nervously at them.

LYNN
Look, for his own well being, I’m
going to need to accurately know
what his handicap is.

Steve turns quickly to the Sponsor beside him.

STEVE
Jeffy want a V-8!

The Sponsor smiles at him, puts Gown the. folder he’s holding
and reaches behind him into the beverage cooler. As he does,
Steve opens the Sponsor’s folder and quickly sneaks a peek at
the medical recerd inside. .

Gary looks beside him and notices A FEMALE VOLUNTEER hugging
an ATHLETE.

I bet Jeffy could use a hug.

LYNN
Jeffy... would you like a hug?

“Jeffy” nods. She gives him an affectionate hug. Steve
closes his eyes and enjoys it. .

STEVE

Lynn chuckles. Gary checks Lynn out as her back is turned:
“Not bad.” Lynn starts to lead Steve away. Gary moves
closer to her.

GARY
Let me help you walk him. He can
be a real handful --

LYNN
Could you go there, please, and
fill out his registration forms.

Lynn starts to walk away with “Jeffy”. Steve sneaks a look

STEVE
Oh... Jeffy forgot.
The two of them share another laugh. Then Steve walks up to

the starting line and hunches forward next to the other
athletes. He looks to his right.

Hunched over beside him is RUDY, a guy with Down Syndrome.

Steve looks at him in total shock. The STARTING GUN goes
off. ONE OF THE ATHLETES runs in the other direction and
starts to scream.

Steve starts running at a leisurely pace, not wanting to
embarrass his “handicapped” competitors. But to his
amazement, all of them, led by Rudy, are blowing past him
with ease.

CUT TO:
EXT. QUALIFYING FIELD — DAY

Steve is lined up for the high jump. AN ATHLETE beside him
sprints towards a high bar and leaps expertly over it. Steve
takes a running start, then manages to lift himself only a
couple of feet in the air, landing well in front of the bar.
A FEW OF THE ATHLETES nod their heads and give hima
sarcastic “thumbs up”.

CUT TO:

CLOSE on Steve, now running the 400 meter dash. He has a
look of pure determination in his eyes. There‘’s no one
within 10 yards of him.

PAN SLOWLY to REVEAL Steve is actually way behind everybody
else. Suddenly, ONE OF THE COMPETITORS trips and falls.

A bunch of the other athletes turn their heads, then run over
and help him up, as has become tradition in the Special
Olympics.

Steve, oblivious, just keeps on running towards the finish
line. He pumps his fist a little, proud of himself, when he
crosses the finish line.

Steve has just finished the pentathlon trials and he looks
absolutely exhausted, much more so than his handicapped
opponents. Lynn runs over to him.

Lynn hugs Steve. Steve savors the hug a little too much once
again. Lynn walks over to congratulate the next qualifier.
Gary pounds Steve on the back.

when he was watching “Family Guy”) Yolie just looks at him.
There's a bit of a silence.

LYNN

Yolie’s from Seattle.
Steve just nods, reluctant to do his Jeffy voice around her.

YOLIE
Where you from?

YOLIE
Sometimes.

STEVE
Uh, how often would you say?

YOLIE

I don’t know. It varies.

STEVE
From season to season? Or day to
day?

YOLIE

Uh, I don’t know. Both I guess.
There’s a bit of a silence. Finally, the Waiter walks over.

WAITER
Are you ready?

STEVE
Yeah! Okay, the lady will have
salad and I'll have the fettuccine
alfredo and --

They all look at him for a beat.

STEVE (CONT'D)

INT. RESTAURANT - LATER

All of them except Yolie are leaning back in their chairs,
looking a little stuffed. Steve is talking up a storm now,
feeling more relaxed.

STEVE

happy, really happy, but then he

agony. Lynn looks at Steve, then takes his arm and starts to
walk him back towards the camp.

greeting a teacher. .

ALL OF THEM
Hi David...

DAVID
You must be excited, huh, guys?
Games are only a couple days away.

A few of them smile politely at David. The rest of the guys
just continue to watch TV.

EXT. OLYMPIC TRAINING FIELD — NIGHT

Steve is outside, by himself, practicing, looking more
determined than he ever has in his life.

All the training’ he’s been doing in the last week is starting
to pay off. He’s actually starting to look pretty damn good
in all five of the events.

Suddenly, a light comes on in one of the dorms.

Elliot leans over and hands Jimmy a piece of paper while
Jimmy runs. Jimmy shakes his head, then tosses the paper
away.

JIMMY

Hey is for horses.

Matt fires his starting pistol and the two of them take off.
The two of them run neck in neck for a few yards. Then Jimmy
Gigs down and grabs the lead. as he does, he half turns to
Steve, taunting him, waving his hand forward.

Steve runs faster but ends up losing by a good ten yards to
Jimmy. Steve hunches over after the race, having pushed
himself harder than he ever has.

GARY
What the hell was that?

Steve looks up, startled to see Gary standing there.
EXT. OLYMPIC VILLAGE — Day

Steve and Gary are sitting on a bench outside of Steve’s

Jeffy called number on back and
asked them to bring new one... in
person.

LYNN
That was very nice of you. You’re
a really good person, Jeffy. You
know that?

Steve looks down. The “Kids” continue to play, thé crowd by
now really whipped into a frenzy. The athletes on the dance
floor are really busting loose now.

In the middle of the floor, Mark and Yolie are dancing away,
having a ‘ball.

A few feet away from them, Glen and The Stripper are doing a
bizarre version of the lambada.

Behind them are Billy and Sally. They’re the only couple
slow dancing. She has her head nuzzied on his shoulder,
looking happier than she has in 60 years. Billy looks both
ways, then slowly moves one of his hands up towards her
breasts.

Standing against the wall, alone, is Thomas. He’s watching
Jimmy and Karen dance, his heart breaking in two. Jimmy
spots Thomas watching him, then leans over and starts to
tengue Karen’s ear. Thomas shudders.

Lynn turns to Steve and holds out her hand.

Steve is dancing more spastically than even the severely
handicapped dancers on the floor. SHELLY, one of the singers
in the band, steps to the mike.

SHELLY
Now it’s time to bring it down a
moment. Keep it real...

The Kids From Widney High start to play a ballad. All the
couples look at each other and start to dance slow. Steve
and Lynn look at each other for a beat.

STEVE
Uh... could you teach, Jeffy?
{looks at her)
One day he may wanna ask out girl.

Lynn looks at him for a beat. She smiles.

LYNN
Sure, Jeffy. Here. Okay. Put
your arm over there... Like this.
No, no, no... not on my stomach,

Steve is trying his best, but he’s pretty clumsy at it.

LYNN (CONT'D)
And I‘ll put my arms around you...
like this. Now let’s just move to
the music.

Lynn moves a little closer and the two of them start to
dance. Steve drops his head on her shoulder. The two of
them stay like this for several seconds. Steve sniffs her
hair and sighs, happier than he’s ever been in his life.

Lynn moves a tiny bit closer to him.

I think you’re pretty perfect too,
Jeffy. I mean it. I think you’re
funny, and sweet, and brave...

Steve looks at her, moved, the first time he’s heard these
things from a woman in a long time. Then, overcome by the
moment, he leans in to kiss her. Lynn looks at him, shocked,
and quickly pulls her head away.

LYNN (CONT'D)
I’m sorry, Jeffy. I didn’t mean to
give you any ideas.

STEVE
You didn’t --

LYNN
No, no. I did and I’m very sorry.

STEVE
Don’t be sorry. Jeffy’s fault.

LYNN
No, it wasn’t. Listen, you did
nothing wrong. Absolutely...

Lynn looks away, about to lose it.

launch our games, please welcome
eur first ever Gold Medal winner in
the Pentathlon, Arthur Graham!

ARTHUR GRAHAM, a mentally handicapped athlete now in his
70’s, slowly and unsteadily makes his way onto the field,
holding the Olympic flame.

He looks around at all the people in the stands, and
suddenly, stirred on by all the excitement around him,
summons back something within him and starts to sprint
quickly and gracefully around the field. .

The crowd goes wild. Arthur pumps his fist high in the air,
then runs a couple more laps around the field. Finally, on

- the verge of collapsing, he staggers towards the Olympic

Torch and lights the flame. The crowd claps even harder.

OLYMPIC OFFICIAL (CONT’D)
And now, I would like to ask all
our athletes to put their hands
over their hearts and recite the’
Olympic Oath.

All the athletes put their hands over their hearts. One by
one, the athletes step forward in their places and recite the
Olympic Oath.

Steve looks around the field, blocking out all the noise
around him, the enormity of what he’s gotten himself involved
in hitting him squarely between the eyes.

Then he looks across the field and sees Lynn. Standing by
herself, looking preoccupied. Steve stares at her and sighs.

Suddenly, Glen pokes Steve in the ribs, knocking him out of

his reverie. A Special Olympic VOLUNTEER is standing in

Lynn smiles at him and walks into the theater. Ushers Thomas
and Karen show her to her seat, in the front row.

~ INT. SCHOOL THEATER — DAY

( : The play is in midswing. Sammy is strutting around the stage
as “Vinny Barbarino.*

SAMMY
Up your nose with a rubber hose,
Mr. Woodman!

The audience laughs. Steve opens the curtain and scans the
sea of laughing faces in the crowd, getting high off their
laughter and the effect it’s having on his actors. Suddenly,
he looks into the audience and spots Lynn.

Lynn sees him too. The two look at each other for a long
time. The curtain goes down and everyone applauds. After
a few seconds, Lynn and Steve walk slowly towards each other.
There’s a few seconds of silence.

STEVE
Hey...
LYNN
Hey...
STEVE
co You... you look great.

Thanks...
STEVE

So... what brings you down here?
LYNN

I wanted to see Pedro play the

guitar. .
STEVE

What? How did you know about --

LYNN
Steve, the whole thing was on “60
Minutes.” And “20-20.”

STEVE
Oh, yeah. Right.
(long pause, looks at her)
I... tried to call you.

LYNN
I know. Over twenty times.
(off his look)
( I have caller ID.

Lynn manages a small smile. Steve looks like he’s going to
cry.

STEVE
Oh God, Lynn. I am so sorry...

eve moves a little closer to her. She moves away.

STEVE (CONT'D)
Don't hate me. C’mon, Lynn...
please. You once told me I was a
really nice person.

LYNN
I believe I said that to Jeffy.

STEVE
Well, we're the same guy. More or
less. I mean, maybe I’m not as
good a dancer. And I don't dress
as well. And...I'ma hell of a lot
more incoherent. : . .

Lynn smiles a bit, then looks away. Steve looks down.

STEVE (CONT'D)
Lynn. I need you to forgive me.
You, more than anybody.

_LYNN
What? Why am I --

STEVE .
I meant all those things I said
about you. You are perfect. You
do treat everybody well. You do
make everyone feel better around
you. I mean, maybe not me, right
now, but everybody else.

Lynn smiles a little, despite herself. Steve smiles back at
her. He reaches forward to give her a little hug. She pulls
away.

: GLEN
Come on, Lynn! He’th thorry!

Lynn turns around. She sees Glen, Mark, Billy, and Thomas,
standing right behind them.

BILLY
Steve sorry. Definitely sorry.
THOMAS
Yeah. To err is human, to forgive
is... Did I tell you my father grew

a moustache?

MARK
Cut him a break, okay? Some guys
are a little slow when it comes to
women of the opposite sex... if you
get my drift. .

Lynn looks at him. She smiles. Then she turns to Steve and
moves slowly towards him. Steve holds out his arms again to
hug her. She extends her hand instead.

STEVE .

Well, it’s a start.
They shake hands warmly. They look at each other for a beat

STEVE
Oh, shit. I‘m sorry. Now, Pedro!

Pedro reaches down and picks up a flamenco guitar. He plays

beautifully for about ten seconds. Then, suddenly, one of

his fingers keeps bumping up against the strings, interfering
--with his otherwise perfect performance. :

We CLOSE IN on his hand and see that one of his three fingers

obviously didn’t “take” -— it’s still a useless ‘stump. ‘As the

Special Olympians continue to sway to the music, we:

FADE OUT.
