INT. MABRY BARN - DAY 1

The door slides open and MADYLYN, in her 20's, a petite,
tart,taciturn woman holds a cigarette.

Her 4 year old daughter, CANDACE, charges in.

CANDACE
Look, look!

JACK, mid 20's, enters laden with a cigarette between his
teeth. He’s wiry, strong, intense. Black hair slicked up and
back. Very sure of himself.

MADYLYN
Good lord in heaven. It's really
falling apart.

JACK
Let it rot. God damn waste of space
anyway.

They glance about the huge empty space - as Candace runs
around the rusting abandoned remnants of a once thriving
dairy barn, rattling off the wonders

CANDACE
A tractor...and lots of hay...

Madylyn and Jack stand side by side in the doorway. They both
take slow drags and then turn to each other and smile.

EXT. MABRY YARD — DAY 2

Jack and Candace jump and run in the fields of tall grass
bordering the house and barns.

Jack does a comic fall backwards in the grass - and
disappears. Candace giggles and tries to copy him. Madylyn
watches - smokes.

Jack and Candace stare at the simple farmhouse and
surrounding barns.

JACK
This was my daddy's house, He was a
farmer and his daddy was a farmer
teo.

CANDACE
Are you a farmer?

JACK
Hell no.

EXT. MABRY YARD - DAY 3

Madylyn snubs her cigarette and bows her head. Jack lowers
his head but keeps his cigarette in his

teeth. Candace closes her eyes but sneaks a peek at her
parents during the prayer.

MADYLYN
Bless, ch Lord, these gifts to our
use, and us to Thy loving
service...

Jack opens one eye and catches Candace and bumps his eyebrows
and she laughs and shuts her eyes quickly. Madylyn knows what
has happened and smiles, without opening her eyes.

MADYLYN (CONT‘D)
In Christ's name, Amen.

JACK
Amen.
CANDACE
++.And Amen.
EXT. MABRY YARD - DAY 4

Jack and Madylyn sip cocktails. Candace drags a rusting saw
from the barn, tries to saw a plank of wood.

JACK
No, honey...
CANDACE
Io can do it.
JACK
Nope. It’s old and rusty.
CANDACE
Please...
JACK

No, baby. No means no.

MADYLYN
Jack...why don’t you help her?

He stops her with a look “Don’t contradict me.” But she eyes
him evenly.

MADYLYN (CONT'D)
She wants to try.

He stares at her, more pissed than he should be, Madylyn
holds the plank steady as Candace struggles to run the saw
back and forth across it. The blade falis off.

CANDACE
Oh...

JACK
Like I said...

He turns his back on Madylyn and scoops up Candace and walks
off. Madylyn stares at hi
EXT. MABRY HOUSE ~— DAY 4n

Jack walks to the end of his long driveway. Opens his
mailbox.

A muscle car pumping loud music drives passed - then slows to
a stop.

Jack watches the car slowly reverse toward him.
VOICE
+..Anything interesting in the mail
today?...Mr. Jack Mabry.

Jack leans into the passenger window - sees a teenage girl
and a man in his late twenties leering back at him.

Jack studies the man‘s face, then smiles,

JACK
Walters? Jesus. How long's it...?

WALTERS
Three years next month.

JACK
Any violations?

*
 

 

 

WALTERS
Nope. None anybody can prove
anyway.

Jack smiles. Candace and Madylyn have come over.

CANDACE
Can we get ice cream?
JACK
Not now.
GIRL
C’mon, get the little lady an ice
cream.
WALTERS

Yeah Jack. Show her what a big man
you are. You know your Daddy's one
hard ass sonofabitch, sweet-thing.
I had to clean my ass with a cue—

tip two years before he'd write me
a release.

He laughs, a little too hard.
Jack's smile fades a little. Candace clutches at his leg.

CANDACE
Daddy.

Walters holds out some change.

WALTERS
Here ya go darlin.

Jack gently pushes his hand back. Madylyn watches him.

WALTERS. (CONT'D)
What? Least I can do after all you
done for me. Right?

Madylyn steps up, pulls Candace to her. Jack puts his arm
around Madylyn, kisses her head.

JACK
(looks him in the eyes)
You just keep it together, make me
proud. Okay?

Walters eyes him back. Smiles.

WALTERS
Nice place.

He winks and drives off laughing. Jack and Madylyn watch.

INT. MABRY HOUSE ~ CANDACE’S ROOM ~ NIGHT 5

Candace wakes and shuffles sleepily to her parents room.

INT. JACK AND MADYLYN'’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 5A
Candace stares at the moving shapes under the blankets.
Madylyn sits up, startled. Jack curses.

LATER:

Candace sleeps soundly next to her parents.

Jack faces away from Candace, spooned up against Madylyn from
behind. He moves into her and holds her tightly around the
chest. At first Madylyn whispers protests, but her breath
quickens and finally she relents. Jack builds intensity,

fierce.

Candace sleeps.

OMITTED 6

IN?. MABRY HOUSE - KITCHEN ~ DAY 7
Jack sits at the table reading the sports page. Madylyn
serves him a drink. She lingers, sipping her own drink, runs
her fingers through the back of his hair. He reads, ignoring
her.

Almost unnoticed, a BEE enters a window. Just a subliminal
sound in background.

INT. MABRY HOUSE - JACK AND MADYLYN’S BEDROOM -— DAY 8

Madylyn tucks a sleepy Candace in for a nap.

CANDACE
I like your bed better.

Ho RO

*
 

 

MADYLYN *

It's ok honey. *
She sits on the edge of the bed and strokes her kid's *
shoulder, sipping her drink. She stares out the open *
window... doesn’t notice the BEE crawling across the shut *
screen. She moves to sip and stops, hand trembling the *
tiniest bit. Her eyes are wet, booze or emotion...hard to
say.
The SOUND OF THE BEE is just a little bit louder, turning
into a VIBRATION.

9 iNT. MABRY HOUSE ~- LIVING ROOM -— CONTINUOUS 9 *
Jack watches golf in a chair in front of the TV. Madylyn
stumbles into the room. She stands staring at him, at the
back of his head.

The sound of the BEE banging against the screen is morphing, *
almost a TUNING FORK now... Madylyn slugs the last of her
drink, trembling.
MADYLYN
Look at me.
Jack glances at her.
MADYLYN (CONT'D)
I’m not standing for this.
Jack only semi breaks from the golf, half-hearing. Looks back
to her in a glance, eyes still on the game.
JACK
What’s that, hon...?
MADYLYN
You keep my soul in a dungeon.
He looks at her now...quizzical.
MADYLYN (CONT'D)
T‘ll leave you...I’m leaying.
He stares at her and she stares back. He gets up and walks
toward her, not fast but she retreats a step...and he just
walks past her, and up the stairs. *

 

MADYLYN (CONT'D)
Jack, do you hear me...
 

 

 

9A

Suddenly Madylyn races upstairs
INT. JACK AND MADYLYN’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 9A

Jack pushes up the window, trapping the BEE between the glass
panes.

He turns back and lifts a sleeping Candace as Madylyn rushes
into the room. Jack kicks out the screen and HOLDS THEIR
SLEEPING CHILD OUT OVER THE DROP. Madylyn freezes.

JACK
You mean it? Huh? If you leave
me...T’ll do it.

MADYLYN
Jack...

JACK
You think that I won't? You think I
won't!?

His voice is like a punch but there is pain and fear in his
face.

THE SOUND is rising all around Madylyn, engulfing, vibrating
in waves. Terrifying. She trembles.

And then she breaks. Tears pour from her eyes and she moves
to him with arms outstretched to embrace him. He places
Candace on the bed, and Madylyn shuts the window quickly,
SHUTTING OUT THE SOUND. Jack grabs Madylyn in an embrace,
almost sobbing...

JACK (CONT'D)
Don't ever...

MADYLYN
Shhh, I won’t...I‘m sorry...

He kisses her with deep passion, she's wrapped around him.
Candace wakes and looks at her parents.

C.U. - THE BEE...crushed in the window, it’s last slow
movements...

EXT. MABRY YARD - LATER THAT DAY 10

Jack and Madylyn, standing with backs to camera, talk quietly
on the lawn. Candace sneaks up behind them...

40 YEARS LATER:

INT. CHURCH - DAY ll

Madylyn, singing in the Episcopal Congregation. She is in
her early 60’s now, still beautiful despite weight of
drinking and time. She sings with conviction and feeling.

CONGREGATION

‘Praise God from whom all blessings

flow. Praise him all creatures here

below. Praise him above ye Heavenly

Hosts. Praise Father, Son and Holy

Ghost.’ Ah-men
Jack, his hair now gray, has retained the vestiges of
unforced virility, but as he sits back down. in the pew he
sighs deeply from a heaviness that he rides, and doesn’t deal
with. Because there’s not time, and he has other things to
do.

He reaches over and takes his wife’s hand in his, as the
service continues. He seems unsettled - collar too tight.

TITLES: ‘STONE’

INT. CHURCH HALL -— DAY 12

Jack and Madylyn mingle with fellow CHURCHGOERS over coffee
and pastries.

Jack greets people warmly. He shares a laugh with an EX-CON,
pats him on the back.

Later, Jack and Madylyn linger at their table with coffee.
Madylyn laughs into her coffee at something Jack says.

INT. PRISON CAFETERIA - DAY 13
The first thing you notice is the NOISE. Chaotic. Jarring.
Hundreds of men, the collective energy of a riot...a bomb.

Held forcibly in check but sparking off everywhere.

STONE, late 30’s, wiry and hard. In line for food. Jittery,

nothing moving fast enough for him. His eyes flick to the
clock which never seems to move. His eyes roam the room
taking in its chaos. Sounds fragmented and disorienting.

STONE
Aw, c’mon man...

His impatience is permanent. Fundamental. Purgatory.
INT MABRY HOME - BEDROOM - DAY 14

Jack changing into casual clothes. His demeanor neutral,
maybe a little tired. Madylyn sits on the bed and dials the
phone. Her face lights up.

MADYLYN
Candace? It’s Mom. Well I don’t
know if you recognize my...

Madylyn laughs. Jack pays no attention, doesn’t even turn
around.

MADYLYN (CONT’D)
No, we’re just back. Your father’s
right here, do you..? Ok. Fine. 7
know. I know Candace, but that’s my
job, okay? Alright..anyway, how’s my

Jack leaves the room.

MADYLYN (CONT'D)
(quieter)
Stop it, really.

INT. MABRY HOME - LIVING ROOM ~ DAY 15 *

A little later. Jack watches golf, one arm draped over his
head. Madylyn in the kitchen, making them drinks. She walks
over and hands him his. He takes it without looking up, *
mumbles thanks.

*

She goes back and putters in the kitchen, humming.

EXT. PRISON YARD ~ LATE AFTERNOON 16

All the normal yard activity. Clusters of men.
Conversations. Basketball. Stone leans on the fence staring
at cars driving in the distance. At the sun getting low. An
INMATE passes by.

STONE
What time is it?

INMATE
Fuck you time.

Stone nods and then explodes, attacking the guy as we CUT:

INT. MABRY HOME - BEDROOM - NIGHT 17 *

Jack joins Madylyn in bed and kisses her goodnight. He rolls
over and his back makes him grunt a little. She rubs his
shoulders a little, sweetly. He sighs and closes his eyes,

INT. MABRY HOME - BEDROOM ~ LATER 18 *

The phone jars Jack and Madylyn awake. He answers it and
listens. Madylyn watches his face. He nods to her. She puts a
hand to her mouth and sits up.

JACK (ON PHONE)
Oh, Betsy...1 know...I know. Yes,
it was...Do you want us to...?
Alright, we'll be over in the
morning...we love you too.

He hangs up, affected.

JACK (CONT'D)
Bobby slipped away just after
midnight,

. MADYLYN
Oh, I’m sorry, Jack. I'm so sorry.

She embraces him and kisses his cheek.

JACK

Well. Finally out of his misery.
MADYLYN

That’s right. He's in a better

place.

He lies down next to her. She holds her hands together and

says a silent prayer. Then she turns on her side and looks

at him. He lies staring at the ceiling. She waits, ready to
talk about it...searching his face, reading his feelings.

He sits up.

JACK
T want to...
(sighs)
I think I’m gonna look at my notes.

He gets out of bed, leaving her alone.

INT. CHURCH - DAY 19
Jack stands at the pulpit for his eulogy.

JACK
++-and I won't say being kid
brother to such an All-American was
always great. “Why can’t you be
like your brother Bobby?”...if I
had a nickel for every time...and I
should confess for the record...
that scar on his forehead, he told
a lot of stories about how he got
it. But it was me...I threw a
hammer at Mr. Perfect when I was
eight,

People laugh warmly.

JACK (CONT'D)

He never told though. He covered
for the people he loved, that’s how
he was. And I loved him for it. And
I wanted to be like him.

(beat - he goes off his

notes)
I want to say this...where we grew
up, it wasn't...it was...Not
everybody was...Without Bobby, I’m
not sure where I’d have...if I'd
have made these choices...He showed
me how to live. What was right. He
lived right.

{chokes up the smallest

bit)
He lived right. And in the end,
what more could you want people to
say about you?

Madylyn has tears in her eyes.

EXT. CHURCH ~ DAY 20

Steps of the church. Mourners lingering, comforting and
chatting. JACK stands apart, alone, shaking hands looking
over at...Madylyn consoling Bobby’s widow BETSY.

VOICE
+-Poor Betsy...

Jack turns. FRANK, a financial advisor/insurance guy, early
40's, Not afraid to do a little business at 4 funeral.

FRANK
She deserves better. You don’t need
that kind cf uncertainty at a time
like this...You given any thought
to...?

JACK
No. I mean...yeah, yeah I’m
thinking about it but...let’s
see...

FRANK
Don’t think too long. You retire in
what...three months?
(talking quickly now)
All I'm saying...that policy it’s
peace of mind, sure, but when
you're pension fund is down 40?

FRANK (CONT'D)

the dollar and we put it to work
for you now in a bargain value
market while everyone else is
standing around like a
zombie...paralyzed. Like Buffett
says, “When there’s blood in the

streets...”

JACK
Okay...okay...this really isn’t the
best...

FRANK

Sorry. I’m just saying...
retirement...what do you want that
to be? Planning for death? Shit,
there’s a moment here...grab it and
enjoy life. You’ve earned it.

They look at Betsy crying, frightened.

FRANK (CONT'D)
My condolences.

EXT. MABRY FRONT PORCH - EVENING 21

Jack and Madylyn sit, sipping their drinks and looking out on
the gloaming light falling, mid conversation.

MADYLYN

(sips, shaking her head)
So many people, followed ail the
rules only to find that what you
invested in, what you worked for,
hasn‘t gotten you what you
thought... too late to start
again...Oh, Lord,

She looks at him.
JACK
Don’t. We’re not going to...we're
going to be fine.

back. Even here, he’s impatient. For what?

tone closes his eyes and sighs. Got through another day. But
his eyes pop open, staring in the dark.

INT. PRISON ~ ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICES — DAY 23

Jack at work - an out-of-date facility. He moves down halis
and consults with co-workers on cases. Jack has authority
here. He is in charge.

LATER - Jack is on the phone about a case. 23A

JACK (ON PHONE)
You have him report back to me as
soon aS he...no...no...listen to
me. It comes to me first, got it?
Okay.

LATER —- Down the hall from his office the secretary, 233
MISS DICKERSON, is black, 60 and no nonsense. Jack strolis
out to lunch with A COUPLE OF MIDDLE-AGED CO-WORKERS.

JACK (CONT'D)
You're in charge, Dickerson.

Dickerson snorts.

INT. JACK’S OFFICE - DAY - LATER 24

Jack listens to a very tough looking BLACK INMATE in a prison
jumpsuit. Trying to be persuasive...

SINCERE INMATE
+:.With Jesus and my family, and
all the advice from you Mr.
Mabry, that social worker
Ms. Honeycutt, all of them, I’ve
taken it all to heart, you know

hunting and pecking and talking on phone.

JACK (ON PHONE)
Another year and nothing to show
for it, same crap, same line. I do
agree, That’s what I'm writing.

LATER - ANOTHER INMATE IN THE CHAIR. 2468
Hispanic Guy, young, 29. Looks shell-shocked and tired.

INMATE
I’m ashamed of it but I was
desperate and it was a plastic gun,
man, it was a toy. I was never
going to hurt nobody...but, listen,
I know what I did was wrong...My
mother, she feels...she tells me
she feels proud of what I have done
to educate myself. I don’t want to
disappoint her...so you know...

He trails off. Jack is lost in thought, hardly listening.

LATER - Jack at his desk writing notes. Dickerson pokes h@ac
head in.

DICKERSON
Warden wants to see you.

INT. PRISON - WARDEN’S OFFICE - DAY 25

Jack walks in, The WARDEN behind his desk, early 50's,
easygoing for a guy in his job, has a sense of humor but
knows the job ground up. He’s talking to a FEMALE FACILITY
SUPERVISOR, early 40's. They turn, dropping something they
were discussing.

JACK
Janice. What's up Stu?

WARDEN
Hey, shut the door, Jack.
(seems to have something
to say, holds up a file)
DeShawn Mackey? Yours right? Your
report?

JACK
Yeah, why?

Warden and Janice exchange a grave look.

WARDEN
It's an incompetent mess, Jack.
Look, I know your head's already on
your golf game, but this is a
travesty of proper case work.

He drops the file in the trash. Jack is dumbfounded.
The Warden and Janice burst out laughing.

JACK
Oh...Jesus...

WARDEN
Gotcha.

Jack's laughing now, the Warden really laughing hard. He
fishes the file out of the wastebasket and hands it to
Janice.

WARDEN (CONT'D)
Here, learn from the master of
understatement. Keep ‘em brief.

Jack stops laughing, confused.

WARDEN (CONT’D)
I need you to get Janice up to
speed before you're out the back
door. So let's pass her all your
indeterminates eligible this year.

Jack has to take this in...his retirement suddenly real.

JACK
Okay...I mean...yeah, yeah of
course.
(beat)
I‘d like to stay on my currents
though. See ‘em to review.

WARDEN
Hey, if you're willing...appreciate
it.

Janice snatches up the files ~ Jack’s lifework — and gets up
to go. She pauses at the door.

Jack looks at him a beat.

JACK
We're not talking about me okay.

They stare at each other in silence.

INT. JACK’'S CAR - DAY 28

Jack drives home, news on the radio about the economy and
layoffs and corporate malfeasance flushing people’s pension
funds and all of it...

INT, LIQUOR STORE ~ DAY 29

Jack walks in and the guy behind the counter knows him so
well that while talking on the phone he just pulls Jack's two
bottles and rings it up without even pausing his call.

EXT. MABRY HOME ~ SUNSET 30

Jack parks and gets out. A young couple is walking by on the
sidewalk, arms on each other. Not that Jack stops and
notices or anything, they are just there passing through.
Youth.

INT. MABRY HOME - EVENING 31

Madylyn is vacuuming. She doesn't hear Jack enter. She’s
bending over slightly, her back to him. He stares at her a
beat and then steps toward her quietly, reaches as though to
grab her hips then she turns and startles hard, startling
him. She laughs right away and he chuckles too maybe.

Jack listens closely.

STONE (CONT'D)
It was a tragic mistake I made
but I've learned my lesson, Mr.
Mabry. And I’ve paid with hard time
and I’m ready to be out. Can you

EXT. MABRY FRONT PORCH — EVENING 33

From inside MUSIC can be heard. Madylyn and Jack sit sipping
drinks. Jack is listening distractedly.

MADYLYN

Where have you gone?

Jack looks up, then away.

JACK

He shakes his head. She looks at him, expecting the story.
He’s silent. She turns away and takes a hard drag.

MADYLYN
+++Been a while since you brought
one home.

She smiles, looks at him. After a moment or two she stands
again, finishing her drink.

MADYLYN (CONT’D)
You want a topper?

He hands her his glass. She goes in.

INT. PRE-SCHOOL - DAY 34

A CLASS OF PRESCHOOLERS play with the LEAD TEACHER, and her
AIDE, LUCETTA: 27, sexy as hell, free, fun, and womanly. The
children adore Lucetta because she thinks like they do.

LUCETTA
Let’s make today a special day!
Let’s do one nice thing for someone
else, and not tell anyone we did
it.
INT. MABRY HOME ~ DAY 35
Madylyn plays poker with SEVEN MATRONS. Lots of smoke,
laughter, food, and skill. The phone rings, Madylyn gets up
to answer.
MADYLYN
Hello...Excuse me? Excuse me I
couldn’t understand...This is Mrs.
Mabry...Well, you need my husband.

Madylyn makes a face, hangs up, goes back to poker.

LUCETTA
She was sort of short with me. Like
she didn’t want to talk. So I just —
Tommy! Don't bite! We don’t bite.

STONE'S VOICE
You gotta stay on it.

LUCETTA
Huh?

She's been cut off.

LUCETTA (CONT’D)
Shit, Amber, don't hit Tommy! No.
We don’t hit. Everybody love
everybody.

INT. PRISON ~ JACK'S OFFICE ~ DAY 42
Stone back in Jack’s office.

JACK
Listen. All I'm getting at...Do you
believe it was wrong, what you did?

STONE
Did I know what I was
doing when I set the fire? Am I
evil? Or was I out of my mind when
I did it? You want me to tell you
about my bad childhood?

JACK
Did you have one?

STONE
We all got one, right?

Jack cracks a smile which makes Stone smile.

JACK
But you think you've changed.

STONE
You mean ~ am I going to set any
more grandparents on fire?

JACK
Are you?

STONE
Nope.

JACK
You got anymore?

Stone knows Jack's trying to make a joke. He smiles.

STONE
one,

JACK
Well...try to...you know...make a
better effort with that one.

Stone smiles. Jack appreciates it. But then Stone's eyes
begin to water and he turns away.

JACK (CONT'D)
I’m not trying to be flip.

STONE
Me either. I'm rehabilitated, man.

JACK
Why because you did the time? And
that’s it? That makes you ready?
You're a clean slate?

STONE
Clean as anybody. Clean as you.

JACK
Well. (chuckles) Maybe. Maybe not.

STONE
So lemme ask you something...I'm
serious now...why do you get to
walk around free and easy and I
don’t, then?

JACK
I wasn't convicted of a crime.

STONE
You never did anything bad? Never
did anybody wrong?
Barest hint of a pause from Jack.

JACK
I never broke the law.
 
 

 

 

32.

STONE
Good, but you gotta get with him
person to person...promise me.

LUCETTA
I will baby...I’m on it.

Stone reaches across the table but doesn’t touch her. The
GUARD in the room looks their way and starts to call out.
Stone pulls back.

STONE
I need you. I gotta have you...you
gotta help me.

She basks in this last statement, beams at him.

LUCETTA
Anything. I‘d do anything for you,
baby. You know that.

They watch the guard and play a game handing over a
drumstick. He manages to get it off to her and touch her
finger for one second...she giggles and takes the drumstick
and caresses it with her mouth slowly for him...

LUCETTA (CONT’D)
Qco, I love it greasy...

STONE
Ohh...shit. You killing me. You're
so fucking hot. Did you dress for
me? What you got under there?

She mouths “Nothing.” He dies. She squirms and giggles.

STONE (CONT‘D)
I swear, if he doesn’t...2 don‘t
know what...r have to...

LUCETTA
It’s gonna happen baby.

STONE
If it don't I’m gonna kill myself.

He looks away.

LUCETTA (CONT'D)

You want to play Crazy Eights now?

Stone's gaze is fixed on something. A family around a table
with Bibles. The INMATE reading Bible passages with his girl
and family. Stone looks at the Guard watching them.

LUCETTA (CONT'D)
Baby?

Stone keeps staring, getting tense.

INT. PRISON ~- LIBRARY ~ DAY 46

Stone goes to “Religion” section and pulls down every book he
can find, pamphlets too. Sits at a table and starts to read
voraciously.

TIMECUTS: Some stuff is boring him and he can't even get
through. Something in a PAMPHLET seems to catch his
attention and hold it. He reads.

INT. PRISON ~ CELLBLOCK - NIGHT a7

INMATES settle down for the night. Stone is reading that
pamphiet and a book at the same time, cross referencing
between them. We might see part of the word ZUKANGOR on it,
and maybe the phrase "The Light and Sound of God”

STONE

(reading softly aloud)
Light and Sound are the twin
aspects through which we know God's
Truth. The Light is consuming Fire,
the Sound is terrifying but for one
who experiences these twin pillars,
life becomes fresh and new again.
Through 2uk he is purified of
karma, sin. He gains wisdom,
charity and Freedom...

He considers this...

STONE (CONT’D)
Fuck.

The lights turn off violently. A Roar of protest rises from
the block.

STONE (CONT'D)
Shit! I'm trying to improve myself
here, motherfuckers! !

INT. MABRY HOME - HALLYWAY ~ EVENING

holds her to him closely.

Surprised, she pulls back a bit, thinking they're
done, but he holds on.

JACK
No...just...

Jack

His head is turned away from her, she can’t tell but thinks

he might be crying.

MADYLYN

He breaks the hug, looks at her - then takes her hand and

leads her to the bedroom.

MADYLYN (CONT‘D)
Your back’s ok?

He closes their door.

INT. MABRY HOME - LATER

The house is dark. The phone rings and an answering machine

‘Beep’ is heard. Lucetta’s voice is heard.

LUCETTA'S VOICE
Hi. Hey. This is Lucetta Creeson -
I called before. Uh - I’m married

you know him. IT hope it’s not too
late to call...what is it? Like

INT. MABRY HOME ~ BEDROOM ~ NIGHT

Jack and Madylyn make love. Lucetta’s voice can be heard from

the answering machine down the hall.

LUCETTA'S VOICE

INT. LUCETTA’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 51

Lucetta walks around her one-bedroom with cotton between her
toes nonchalantly naked, the phone under her chin. She checks
the clock: it’s 9:12 pM.

LUCETTA
Stone told me you like to know
people, that you're real nice and
like to talk, or something. So I‘d
like to. Talk to you. I work
mornings, but - no - anytime
that'd be good for you I could
arrange things. I'l] call back but
I gave your wife the number so
please call - maybe you're already
in bed -

She’s cut off.

LUCETTA (CONT’D)
Shit. I hate that. I wasn’t done,

She flings the phone and sits to finish painting her
toenails. Sings lightly to herself.

LUCETTA (CONT'D)

“How can I live without you...I

want to know...” ...Who goes to

sleep at 9:00?
She laughs and is pleased with her toes. She cups her breasts
admiringly. She picks up the phone with a sly, sexy idea and
calls another number.
INT. MAERY HOME - BEDROOM - NIGHT 52
Madylyn sleeps soundly. Jack is awake, on his back. He rubs
one hand over his face, then stares into nothing, thinking.

INT. LUCETTA’S PLACE ~ BEDROOM - NIGHT 53

Lucetta is fucking a MAN. Hard, thrilling.

  

INT. SRY HOME ~ KITCHEN - MORNING 54
Jack and Madylyn sitting down to breakfast. Jack has his chin
on his hands, listening as Madylyn reads her “Daily
Devotions”.
 

 

 

36.

MADYLYN
“,,,Where would I be today if after
failing I wasn’t given another
chance to serve? ...How has failure
brought me new strength and a
stronger commitment to service?”
»..Very good,

She puts it down and puts sugar on her grapefruit. They bow
their heads in prayer.

MADYLYN (CONT'D)
Bless, oh Lord, Thy gifts to our
use, and us to Thy loving service,
and make us ever mindful of the
needs of others, in Christ‘’s name.
Amen,

JACK
Amen.

MADYLYN
Lib said it rained like the devil
out at her place last week but we
didn't get anything. Did you out at
the prison? Friday?

Jack still has his head bowed over his hands, eyebrows knit.
The kettle starts to whistle.

MADYLYN (CONT’D)
No rain, huh?

He doesn’t respond so she stands to get the kettle. He stops
her, holding her wrist. Looks up.

JACK
Did you enjoy yourself?

Arm held, not looking at him, she pauses. She begins to turn
to answer him.

INT. PRE-SCHOOL ~- DAY 55
Lucetta surrounded by her class makes an art project with
empty strawberry containers and twigs. She finishes hers,

checks her watch and calls to the Lead Teacher.

LUCETTA,
Amanda? f got that doctor's thing.

LEAD TEACHER
Ok honey. Everyone tell Miss
Lucetta bye bye.

The children yell out ‘Bye’ and keep working on their
projects. Lucetta scoots out with her container.

INT. JACK’S CAR/EXT. PRISON - PARKING Lot ~ DAY 56
Jack pulls up and parks. His PISTOL is in a CLIP HOLSTER on
the passenger seat. As he gets up out of the car and begins
to walk to the building, he clips it to his belt under his
jacket. Because his head is down, he doesn’t right away see

LUCETTA: standing leaning against her car up ahead. Short
dress, low cut neck.

LUCETTA
Mx. Mabry? Officer Mabry?

Jack’s head pops up and he stops as he sees her.

ON JACK’S FACE: as he sees Lucetta. She has an impact.

JACK
i‘m sorry...Miss...?
LUCETTA
Mrs. Creeson. I’m Stoney’s wife.
JACK
(can’t hide surprise)
Creeson?
LUCETTA

Call me Lucetta though. Please!
She smiles and wiggles involuntarily.

JACK
You here to see...your husband?

LUCETTA
No, silly I came to see you. Didn't
you get my message?

JACK
Yeah...okay, look. Mrs. Creeson...
there’s a way we meet with family.
You go through the office. We
assign a case officer to come and
meet and gauge the home situation.
 

 

 

38.

She laughs.

JACK (CONT'D)
What's funny?

LUCETTA
I'm the home situation, how does it
Look?

She shimmies and giggles. Jack looks around a little
uncomfortable now. But it’s hard not to look at her.
Impossible.

JACK
Ms. Creeson,
(she starts to say
“Lucetta...")}
Lucetta...yeah...Call the office
and make an appointment.

LUCETTA
But I just want to talk with you
for a while. Can’t we just make a
date just you and me? You know how
much this means to us, please...

She’s stepping up to him as she says this and he backs up.

JACK
Please, ma‘am...you've got to go
now. Or visit George...
(she laughs)
Stone... But we can’t do it this
way...I’m late..really.

She digs into her bag.

LUCETTA
I just want to give you this little
something my kids made in class...

JACK
I'm sorry, that’s not appropriate.

He moves to go but she blocks him and forces it in his hand.

LUCETTA
It’s for the birds, see? They make
their nests. You stick it in a tree
and they take their bits of twig
and twine and cotton and they just
make up a little home.
 

 

 

57

39.

She's holding his wrist.

JACK
Okay...enough. I’m sorry.

He goes but he’s still holding the nest awkwardly. Doesn’t
know what to do with it exactly. He looks back.

She waves big. She laughs and stands staring after him,
smiling.
INT. PRISON - SECURITY DESK 57

Jack clears through, Hands over his PISTOL to be checked in
lock box for the day.

INT. JACK'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 58

GUARD by the door. Stone already in the chair waiting. Jack
enters, flustered and pissed. Bird nest/home in his hand.

JACK
What the hell’s all this?

STONE
Buh?

Jack chucks the nest on his desk.

JACK
This. Your wife. What do you got in
mind, you two?

Stone looks at him blankly.

STONE
Lucetta send you that?

JACK
She gave it to me! Just now in the
parking lot.

STONE
Lucetta? She come find you?

JACK
Yeah, I hope you didn’t put her up
to this...you do not want to play
games with me, son.

STONE
Shit, I told you Lucetta does
whatever the fuck she wants, man.
Jack looks at him

STONE (CONT'D)
++-You check out her rack, man?

Jack remains standing behind the desk, studying Stone.

JACK
C'mon,

STONE
What?

JACK

Have some propriety son.
He chucks the nest in the garbage and sits down, exasperated.

JACK {CONT’D)
Jesus what a week...

Jack is a little thrown off his normal focus a bit. He just
sits, thoughts jumbled a bit. He notices Stone has a pamphlet
and a book with him.

STONE
You ever heard of Zukangor? I been
reading.

JACK
No,

Stone passes the pamphlet over. Jack reads...

JACK (CONT'D)
“The Light and the Sound of God.”

STONE
They say the Sound comes first.

JACK
How's that?

That when Truth comes it comes as a
sound that puts you back in

it starts like as a vibration.
Like an electric light buzzing, or
rushing water. Or a bee.

JACK
Yeah?

STONE
Then it grows. That’s what they
say.

JACK

is that right.

STONE
They say everything that happens to
you is what’s supposed to happen
for you, in order for you to
advance ‘cause life continues after
death, lots of times.

JACK
Well...that sounds good.

STONE
But there ain’t no fucking priest
or nothing...there’s some dude
Arnold who’s like the %uk-Master.

JACK
Arnold,

STONE
You supposed to find freedom on
your own. They say when you do the

She looks at him. This is a first. She tries to read what‘s

EXT. PRISON YARD ~ DAY 61

looking up, making a tentative shape with his mouth, looking
around self-consciously and then listening.

But it’s all fragmented and chaotic noise. The same as
always.

Madylyn sings along with music and smokes and reads. She

looks at the time. 4:00pm. She takes a drag, staring into

the middle distance. Her brain is veering toward a thought,
aconcern. But she takes a breath and shakes it off.

MADYLYN
The Lord works in mysterious ways.

She goes back to her bible.

INT. LUCETTA’S BEDROOM ~ AFTERNOON 66

iucetta wipes up between her legs, on her back on the bed. A
naked man walks out of the room.

LUCETTA
Goddamn! Like a quart and a half.
Goddamn!

She squeals with laughter.

INT. CELLBLOCK - AFTERNOON 67

Stone is chanting louder, fighting the CHAOTIC NOISE.
Humming fiercely, if that’s possible. Someone catcalls at
him and he breaks, losing his struggle for calm.

The pastor sips water. Jack stares at him.

Lucetta Creeson. I was looking for
Jack...

MADYLYN

I'm afraid he’s still -
She hears the front door.

MADYLYN (CONT'D)
No - wait, hold on a minute...Jack?
Telephone.

JACK
Who is it?

MADYLYN
Friend of yours?

She was being light but he takes the phone impatiently and
she can see that he’s in a mood. She walks away but we may
feel her linger in the periphery. Old habits.

JACK
Hello?

LUCETTA
Hey! It‘s me, Lucetta. Listen, when
can we get together?

JACK
Ms. Creeson, I don’t know why
you're calling me at home..I told
you to call...

LUCETTA
I don’t like offices though. I
can’t be real with a person in some
office...

Something in his face, trying to assess whether he’s reading
her right.

JACK
Ms. Creeson -
 

 

 

LUCETTA
Lucetta,.

JACK
My business is with your husband.

LUCETTA
(giggles)
Well that's what I want to see
you about! Did you think I had
another reason?

JACK
No, IT did not. But ~

LUCETTA
We can meet for lunch. You could
bring Mrs. Mabry too. She’s got a
sweet voice. What's her first name?

JACK
IT admire that you love your husband
and want what's best for him, but
this isn’t going to help him.

LUCETTA
I do love my husband. I love him so
much. All I’m asking is for a
chance to help you see him in a
different light. How many men in
that place you work have somebody
loving them like that, doesn’t that
mean something to a person in your

position?
JACK
It does...don’t misunderstand me.
LUCETTA
T just want him home. I want his
arms around me. I want him in bed

 

with me. I miss him you know.
She pauses a flicker.

LUCETTA (CONT'D)
Can't I persuade your

You're very persuasive.

Jack is biting his lip.

staring into space listening to her breath.

She can hear him breathing back. She smiles and we CUT:

Lucetta grinning.

LUCETTA
Got him.

Stone and Lucetta at a table. He is quiet. Not as laser-~
focused on her. She is giggly with excitement.

LUCETTA (CONT’D)
It’s gonna happen baby! Oh, and...
AND... I saw Max Jenkins the
other night and he’s still holding
your job at Chrysler. Or, he says
whenever, you know, you're
released, he‘ll have one for you.
So that's good. But, you know, he’s
a little bit funny sometimes I will
say.

STONE
How soa?

LUCETTA
He said he was going to call me
back and he didn’t.

STONE
Maybe he was busy.

LUCETTA
And you know I hate that more than
anything. Being dangled.
(looks at him)
You okay, honey?

STONE
I’m tired.

LUCETTA
Me too.

LUCEPTA (CONT’D)
What, can't you sleep?

STONE
Too loud, All the time...

LUCETTA
Poor honey, I’m pooped too.
STONE
How come?
LUCETTA
I’m tired? I just am. I was up
late.
STONE

Doing what?

LUCETTA
(shrugs)
And work. And stuff. I think it's
gonna be next Friday.

STONE
What do you mean?

LUCETTA
My date with Mr. Mabry.

STONE
That‘s good, baby. Cause I’m having
these weird-ass dreams...

LUCETTA
(flirty)
Yeah? Like what?

STONE
One time - there was this dog, see,
barking its fucking head off. And 1
yelled at the owners to shut the
damn thing up but they were a bunch
of rednecks -

LUCETTA
Wait, this happened or...?

STONE
So what I did was, I fed the dog
steel wool and glass in a
cheeseburger. And that took
care of it.

LUCETTA
(stares blankly)
I don’t get it.

STONE
It took a long time. To die.
Howling. But then it was quiet and
I could sleep.

LUCETTA
You dreamed that?

STONE
(whispers)
I can’t be in here anymore. It’s
messing with my head...

LUCETTA
{stops eating)
I know baby...but we got a plan
now.

STONE
Iwas trying to kill myself. Hang
myself. In solitary. But I was too
scared to die. So I just hung
there, choking...

LUCETTA
In one of your dreams?

STONE
For eternity.

He starts to cry. Lucetta is amazed and doesn’t know what to
She has never seen him do this and she looks to see if
anyone is looking. She reaches for him.

covers and falls asleep, fast, smiling.

INT. MABRY HOME ~- BEDROOM ~ CONTINUOUS 77 *

Madylyn has fallen asleep with her book on her chest. Jack's
side of the bed is turned down, but not slept in. His light
is on. Her bedside clock reads 3:58 AM.

EXT. MABRY HOME ~ FRONT PORCH ~ NIGHT 78 *

Jack sips a highball and smokes an illicit cigarette. First
one he’s had in years. He can’t control where his mind is
going. He looks at the cigarette and throws it down in
disgust.

JACK
Stupid son of a bitch.
EXT. PRISON PARKING LOT ~ PICNIC AREA 73 *

Lucetta sits across a picnic table from Jack. She's got some *
Easter eggs she brought.

Jack glances around at fellow employees at adjacent tables, a *
little uncomfortable. He turns back to Lucetta, who sits *
staring at him with a warm smile, inviting.

 

JACK

I got a grandchild.

LUCETTA

Do you?
JACK

Four years old. Katie. *

Yes she is.

Oh no, hell no.

LUCETTA
T bet she loves you though, See her
much?

JACK

No. No. Candace doesn’t really -
that's my daughter. She...they live
upstate. We don’t see them much.

She begins to peel another egg. He watches her hands.

JACK (CONT'D)
She‘s getting divorced. My daughter
is. Mistake from day one, you know.
i said so, but....you know, you
can’t help... When you see
someone’s life going all to heil?
And she won’t even ~ well. What are
you going to do?

Lucetta shrugs, smiles.

JACK (CONT'D)
People do what they’re gonna do.
Maybe nobody can really help
anybody.

LUCETTA
I don’t believe that at all.

She's looking dead at him, right at his eyes. Jack shifts for

the pain in his back.

LUCETTA (CONT’D)
Are you in pain?

JACK
Just my back.

LUCETTA
From playing ball? Or like, from
some war?

JACK
Just life.

What I can do for you ~ for Stone.
There’s a whole system...

LUCETTA
Have you tried magnet therapy?

LUCETTA (CONT‘D)
For your back. These magnets you
wear and stuff?

JACK
Magnets?

LUCETTA
You should come over to the house
sometime cause I got these insoles
this guy sold me and I wear ‘em in
my shoes and I don’t get tired at
school or anything.

JACK
Huh.

LUCETTA
And then sometimes I put ‘em under
my pillow when I go to sleep.

JACK
Yeah? What does that do?

LUCETTA
Oh, you know we‘re all toxic. It‘s
all the microwaves and cell phones
going through the air, all that
stuff that we can’t see.

LUCETTA (CONT‘D)
Things build up inside you. And it

JACK
Wow. That’s...

LUCETTA
It’s real. I believe in it. You
don’t believe it?

JACK
I don’t know, I guess.

LUCETTA
It’s real. For me it’s all about
the body, you know? When your body
feels good, your head just follows.
Absolutely. Egg?

She offers the peeled egg. He hesitates.

LUCETTA (CONT‘D)
My kids did ‘em. Now I’m stuck with
‘em so I got to eat ‘em all. Salt
or pepper?

JACK
(smiles a little)
Salt and pepper. They're nice.

She sprinkles some of each on top and then gently blows the
excess off. Hands it to him. He eats it, awkward, self
conscious as she watches.

LUCETTA
Well don't be shy, just eat the
whole thing.
He pops the whole thing in his mouth and pretends to swallow,
holding it in his cheek. She gasps and then he brings it
back out between his teeth and she laughs hard...
She holds out second egg, waving it at him.

LUCETTA (CONT'D)
You want some more?

HUM OF THE REFRIGERATOR in Lucetta’s place. The camera
slides along to find...

Jack and Lucetta standing a few feet apart. Jack stands with
his feet slightly wide, still. And she watches him intently.
His eyes are closed.

LUCETTA
Feel anything?

JACK
Um.

LUCETTA

A tingling?

JACK
+..No... I don’t think I...

LUCETTA
A pull? I’m telling you this is
going to change your life...

She moves to him, swaying to the music. Byes closed, Jack

feels her presence. She is easing closer to him and hands him
a beer and sips her own.

LOW HUM of a FLORESCENT LIGHT, BUZZING...
STONE is on his bunk. The block is empty because it’s dinner

TWO GUARDS APPROACH. Start to unlock door.

THE HUM ES A LITTLE LOUDER NOW, almost vibrating.

Lucetta gets closer to Jack. Jack scoots his feet around
some, trying to feel the magnetic insoles’ effect.

LUCETTA
It’s not dramatic. Just a sense.

JACK
Maybe. Yeah. A little something.

She smiles, aware of the effect she has on him. She comes so
close her body is against his side - still swaying to the
music.

LUCETTA
You can borrow them.
JACK
Couldn’t hurt. I guess.
LUCETTA
Nothing wrong with feeling right.

Right?

angely, looking past him.

    

 

He turns follows their look to: A BLACK INMATE approaching in
the opposite direction, pushing a LINEN CART.

 

Stone is ushered into a holding cell to await infirmary.
Stone holds the bars, leaning heavy on them, looking into the
florescent drab space as the BLACK INMATE on work detail
enters with the cart, and enters an adjacent room. OTHER
INMATES DRIFT BY outside in the hallway.

 

THE LIGHTS BUZZ, growing louder, but fracturing in fizzes and
bops. STONE raises his head, as though he is listening. Sound
is chaotic and disorienting.

THE SOUND is rising...

Lucetta playfully brings har lips close to the nape of Jack's
neck as she moves her body around him. She giggles and

breathes on Jack - sort of ‘acting’ the part of a seduction.
He laughs, at the ‘performance’, but is affected.

THE TWO WHITE POWER INMATES ENTER AND ATTACK. In a flash they *

STABBED repeatedly with a shiv... *

STONE: Watching through the bars - the action inches from his
face.

INT. LUCETTA'S APARTMENT - EVENING 87

Lucetta touches Jack, taking his wrist. He doesn’t move,
looks at where she is holding him and his gaze moves along
the arm to her body, He moves around to face her, she lifts
his other hand, places it around her

JACK
My God. Help me...

THE SOUND: is actually pulsing now, like a tuning fork..

INT. PRISON - HOLDING CELL/COMMON AREA - EVENING 88

STONE DROPS TO THE FLOOR -~ watching through the bars: The
guy being stabbed is literally a foot away from Stone, face
screwed up in agony, trying to cover up with his one free arm
as blows rain in on his kidneys and neck and head. PEOPLE
ARE SHOUTING.

The arm with the shiv whips across in between Stone and the
guy, wrapping around to strike him in the throat.

hand reaching out through the bars toward the victim. One of
the attackers stands up and looks right in the camera and
raises his arms, triumphant. In a blur of action, GUARDS
ENTER and throw the ATTACKERS to the floor.

STONE: Staring right into the victims’s EYES as he goes into
shock, EYES WIDE, STARING RIGHT AT STONE.

ALL SOUND IS GONE EXCEPT FOR THE WAVES OF GOD’S TUNING FORK
CRASHING OVER STONE.

Madylyn raises her cigarette and stops halfway to her mouth.
Holding it there for a long frozen beat. She looks over at
the rocker Jack usually sits in. Regards it. Reaches out and
starts it rocking. Then abruptly stands and goes inside.
INT. PRISON - HOLDING AREA/COMMON AREA — EVENING 92
No sound except the TUNING FORK SOUND. A perfect harmonic.
Through the bars of the door we see the CHAOS as guards pound
into the room, separating bodies and checking the guy’s

pulse. But we can't hear anything.

Stone sits on the floor, cross legged with a look of wonder
on his face, listening. He looks up:

STONE’S POV: BRIGHT LIGHT coming through the bars, cut by
shadows of the movement on the other side. He blinks and
smiles.

Why don’t you say the blessing.

Startled a bit, he nods...

He stops.

charged. He looks at his watch...a thought forming.

Then impulsively he guns it and yanks the wheel hard, turning
right out of the middle lane.

EXT. PUBLIC GOLF COURSE - DAY 96

Jack tees up to drive. All is quiet. Beautiful day and he
takes his time. He seems able to focus totally on the ball.
Sound is muted as he winds up...AND HITS A TREMENDOUS DRIVE.
He watches it go...drive of his life.

He looks around to see if anyone saw. Nobody did. A tiny
pump of the fist, just for himself.

Sky. But, really, it’s like a big
blue bowl. You can’t see anything
more than you can see - like
clouds, or stars, maybe, at night.
Even with a telescope you can’t see
forever.

LUCETTA
What?

So how do they know? What’s

Lucetta laughs - then stops when she notices he isn’t.

 

LUCETTA
So Jack, he said the Board’s going

few days to write up his notes in
your case file, if he feels
strongly enough, to submit to the
Parole Commission and put it in the
computer, so when they go over it
next week they'll see it. Isn't
that great? This could be it, baby.
Isn't that great?

Yeah.

He closes his eyes and tilts his head to the side.

Didn't I do good? ...Look at me!

STONE and GUARDS show up in her doorway.

At her desk Ms. Dickerson grunts when she sees them. She
buzzes Jack on the intercom.

DICKERSON (CONT’D)
Creeson‘s here.

Stone waits at the door. Turns to Dickerson.

STONE
You think we'll get any rain later?

Dickerson glares at him. He seems different and she is
suspicious of change in people.

INT. PRISON - JACK'S OFFICE - DAY 103

Jack sits forward studying Stone and reading the report on
the incident of the murder. His demeanor toward Stone is
skeptical and impatient.

STONE
I don’t know if I can really
explain it.

JACK
Well. Try. Please.

Stone stares at him.

STONE
You don’t believe me, do you?

JACK
I’m not saying I don't. Look, I've
seen the tape. It’s quite a thing
but nothing happened to you... I
mean you weren’t involved...okay...

Well, it really don’t matter.

Uh-huh.

STONE
Tt don’t.

JACK
Don‘t get me wrong here...I’d like
to believe in such things.

STONE
In me?

JACK
Yeah. Sure. I‘d like to believe in
you, too, That’s what we’re all
here for, right?

STONE
How can a person describe
something they've been through that
someone else can‘t have any way to
relate to?

JACK
Try it out.

STONE
Tt was a moment. Uh - that’s all.
All the static went away and T
could hear what was true. That's
all. And, see, now I'm going to go
on as I am, whether I’m in here or
not.

JACK
Uh-huh.

STONE
Cause see I understand my life a
little better now - I see that it’s
not empty or accidental like T
thought it was before.

Jack stares at him, Stone’s eyes are clear, not darting. It
unnerves him for a second.

Then Jack snaps out of it. Flicks his ash, and leans forward
as well.

JACK
++-SO - you’re all good now?

STONE
No. Uh-uhn. You don’t get it. I’m
not saying I’m all happy. I’m going
to lose my temper and get pissed
and frustrated say and do things
T/ll regret, even with my wife, but
that’s OK. Know what I mean?

I'm afraid I don’t.

Well, I told you y’wouldn’t
understand.

Jack stares at Stone.

JACK
»..Stone, son. Just...drop it.

STONE
what?

JACK
Just...look, I know what you're
trying to do, but just....don't.
This isn’t helping...just stop.

Stone sighs a little.

STONE
Jack, It doesn’t matter to me.

What you do. Or what anybody's
trying to make you do.

Well. This is a new breeze.

STONE
I’m going to go on the same if I’m
in here or out.

JACK
Is that right?

STONE
I want to be out of jail, sure, but
I‘m going to wrestle with the same
shit if I’m out. And, I’ll have
this same feeling if I stay in.

Jack wipes his brow, reflexively. Takes a drag.

Stone stares at him. He smiles slowly.

 

Jack tries to laugh, and can’t. Finally he pulls his gaze
away and dumps his filled ashtray into his trash can under
his desk.

JACK
Oh, shit, son. Shit. You're a
wonder.

Jack stubs out the cigarette and there is anger in it.

Jack looses an explosive kick on the side of the mower. She
turns..did she see that? He sees her at the same time and
recovers himself.

MADYLYN
You okay?

JACK
My back...can’t keep still. I'll

He exits. She rolls over and closes her eyes.

EXT. JACK‘S CAR ~ NIGHT 106
Jack drives up to Lucetta’s apartment. He gets out and goes
to the door, she lets him in.

INT. LUCETTA’S APARTMENT - NIGHT 10?
Lucetta sits perched on the arm of the couch. Jack is sort of

planted across the space from her, shifting his weight
awkwardly.

LUCETTA
+».if you wanna know really ... I
think it’s all just kind of play
acting.

JACK

It’s all bullshit isn’t it?

LUCETTA
No, Stone's just...you know...He’s
screwed up. His ideas about things
are weird...sometimes really
weird... he’s always been that way.

JACK
Cause talking to him...he almost
seemed like...

LUCETTA
Like what?

JACK
Like something really...I don’t
know. Different...

LUCETTA
He‘’s just trying to impress you and
do what he needs to do to get out.
Can you blame him?

She flicks her skirt up to flash her panties and giggles.

JACK
(awkward)
Okay...

She hops up and taking his jacket lapels begins edging him
toward the couch.

LUCETTA
He admires you a lot you know. He
told me he’s learned a lot talking
to you.

JACK
Can you be straight?

LUCETTA
Straight as you.

She pushes him backward and down onto the couch and starts to
unbutton her blouse.

JACK
Is this all just...? Just tell me
what’s going on.

LUCETTA
I don’t do nothing I don’t want to
do,

JACK
No?

LUCETTA

Tt like you Jack. I would never fuck
you if I didn’t want to.

JACK
(shrugs)
Well. Thanks.

She takes her shirt off. Stands there in her sexy bra,
touching her stomach lightly.

He looks at her, emotionally exhausted.

JACK (CONT’D)
God. You are beautiful.

LUCETTA
{loves hearing that)
Why, thank you,

JACK
i’m not coming over here again.

LUCETTA
You're not?

JACK
No ma’am.

LUCETTA
Ok.

JACK
Well...

He stends up.

JACK (CONTR)
I don’t know. Maybe I should take
some anti-depressants or something.

He hesitates, can't stop leoking at her. Can't move away. She
laughs.

LUCETTA

and the whole time I was just

laughing thinking about you. I like *
thinking about you at work. *
JACK *
Don't say that. *
him back to her. *
LUCETTA *

i think you’re sexy. And if you let
Stone out we can still be friends
too. He wouldn’t care anyway I bet.
I do what I do cause I’m on my own
and gotta make my own way and Stone
won't know.

(looks at him deep)
So don’t you want to help us? Help
me? Not cause we’re fucking or
anything but just cause it’d be
good and we'd all be happy?

JACK
Don’t talk like that. I
can’t...it’s not that simple. *
he sighs, and gets up. She can’t help herself and
LUCETTA
You can’t leave, can you? It‘s
sweet.
JACK

What the hell am I doing? Goddamn.

He gathers up his clothes.

LUCETTA
C’mon he's a good person at heart. *

JACK
You really believe that?

LUCETTA
Yeah I do. As good as you and me.
No different.

he can’t leave.

INT. JACK’S CAR - NIGHT 108

Jack drives home - deserted streets.

INT. MABRY HOME - HALL/BATHROOM - NIGET 109

Madylyn can be heard snoring as Jack eases down the hall and
into the guest bathroom. Through the open door we can see
him start to wash himself off.

INT. PRISON - JACK'S OFFICE - DAY 1106

Jack at his computer, working on Stone's report deciding,
uncertain. He commits and hits a key.

DICKERSON (0.S.)
(yells)
They called again, they need the
Creeson report!

JACK
(a little impatient)
I just sent it.

INT. PRISON - JACK’S OFFICE ~ LATER lili

Jack is prepping Stone for his Parole Board review. He's a
little unnerved by Stone’s calm.

JACK
Ok. The board’s mandate is to
determine if you’ve served your
time well; if you’re a danger to
yourself or others.

STONE
Rehabilitated huh?

Stone eyes him evenly. Jack averts his stare. He gets up
suddenly, stretches his upper body stiffly. Grimaces.
 

 

 

74.

STONE (CONT'D)
They say chronic neck pain comes
from being hanged in a past life.
Or beheaded.

Stone shrugs.

JACK
Well, it's my back, so...It’s not
my neck,

STONE

Just making conversation.

He stares at Jack silently.

JACK
(impatient)
Look, if you’re not interested in
the details of your hearing - we're
done here.

STONE
We're done?

JACK
My report's already done. Sent.
We're done.

Stone: there is something in his face. A tiny smile.
Gratitude? Or something else... Jack stares hard at him for a

second,

unnerved...but he continues

JACK (CONT'D)
Mostly they just want to hear that
you um...take responsibility for

your--
STONE
For my actions?
JACK
Yeah.
STONE
Well...see...the thing about that
is...

(with deep, sincere
feeling)
++.When my cousin came out of the
house...that night...and got me and
we went back in? It was trippy,
going in there and seeing it.

STONE (CONT'D)
Cause like the minute before we
were arguing with Poppy and there
was light im his eyes and color in
his face and then I see them...all
over everywhere, man, and pale like
wax. My head was spinning and my
mouth had taste like I was chewing
on @ penny. But most of all there
was this....this bugging in my
ears. I thought it was the shit we
was on but then it started

 

growing...
112 INT. STONE'S POPPY'S HOUSE ~ NIGHT - FLASHBACK 112
Stone in the hallway. THAT TUNING FORK SOUND RISING IN HIS
EARS.
STONE
a ++-and it scared the shit out of me

man. And Teach was bouncing off the
walls yelling at me to help him

. take care of it. And then his voice
just started going away. I could
see his lips moving but no sound
except this Sound in my head. And I
don’t even now what made me know
it, but I just knew there was going

to be a fire. There had to be. -

 

113 JUMPCUTS: Stone moving up and down the hall pouring 113
GASOLINE.

So I went and got the gasoline out
of the garage and I ran it through
the house up and down the hallways,
and I had some matches and lit it
and watched it flare up and run,
you know, following the lines I
poured, all through the rooms, over
the blood and stuff. Have you ever
seen a fire take control?

114 STONE POV: Down a long hall. The bodies can be seen throudH
the doorway, in pools of blood, just for a second as flame
whooshes down the hall and starts to consume then.

STONE (V.0.) (CONT’D)
I saw it take up Poppy and Grandma
and start to change them and I
thought: This is awesome.

STONE'S FACE: staring in wonder.

116 INT. JACK’S OFFICE ~ DAY 116

Jack stares at him, horror mounting.

JACK
Awesome?

STONE
Yeah. It was awesome. And I know
I’m supposed to feel guilty about
it but I never did and I never knew
why until now. Now I understand
that the whole thing was part of
the miracle of my own journey in
life.

JACK
Cut the crap Stone. It was your
decision. You did that.

STONE
I ain’t saying f didn’t, I'm saying
we‘re Co-workers with God and we
don’t even know it.

JACK
Your crime has nothing to do with
God.

STONE

Why not? God is everything. Look at
tornadoes and floods and
earthquakes. You don’t think we’re
a part of all that? What we carry
with us from one life to the next?
There may be a plan for all of us,
you and me and my grandparents,
that we don’t know. How can we
know?

He stares right at Jack, Totally sincere. Jack shifts in his

chair.

JACK
Enough with this shit! Enough.
You...Lucetta...Even she says ~

STONE,
You call her Lucetta?
 

 

77.

JACK
{emphatic}
Your wife. She said--
STONE
Don't.
JACK
What?
STONE

Den‘t listen to her.

JACK
What do you mean?

STONE
Don’t listen to what she tells you,

JACK
She believes in you.

STONE
No, I’m telling you, man, she’s
just trying to work on you. She's
fucking you over.

Jack falters a second.

STONE (CONT'D)
It’s her playtime.

Jack lights another cigarette, distancing...

 

STONE (CONT’D)
Whatever she says about me is just
cause we wanted to get in good with
you. To get me out. She doesn't
know at all what’s going on with
me. She‘d say anything. And she‘d
@o anything. She gets off on
jerking chains.

JACK
That‘s not a nice thing to say.

STONE
I‘m telling you. It’s all a game to
her. She’s a freak, man.

JACK
You're fucking nuts you know that?
You got a beautiful wife who cares
about you, who's ~

STONE
What do you mean beautiful?

They stare at each other. Stone smiles.

Jack feels caught, suddenly, and very hot, cramped - what
does Stone know? What has Jack gotten into?

Jack raises out of his chair.

JACK
(he's had it)

I don‘t know. Hell. Ok. I’ve heard
enough. All of this crap. Shit. Ok.
You're a con. I’ve known that from
the fucking start. Not for once did
you... So you've both been conning
me. Ok. Whatever. I’ve been around,
son. Jesus. And I'm fucking tired
of it.

STONE
Be calm Jack.

JACK
I’m sick and TIRED OF IT!

He bangs a file cabinet closed.

INT. DICKERSON’S DESK ~ DAY 11?

Dickerson is eating yoghurt with grapenuts - crunching, and
turns her head at the BANG from within Jack's office - mid
erunch. She then rolls her eyes at her boss’s foul mood.

INT. JACK'S OFFICE - DAY 118

Jack’s up now and leaning forward over the desk into Stone’s
face. His shirt is showing pit stains.

JACK
You expect me te eat this new shit
you're dishing out? Write a nice
little note about your goddamn
epiphany?

(MORE )
 

 

 

79.

JACK (CONT'D)
You're the same bastard you've
always been. You son of a bitch.

STONE
i know. I am.

Stone stares at him, but not aggressively. With a complacency
that really rattles Jack.

JACK
Asshole.

STONE
++-You don’t get it.

JACK
Iget it. I’ve got it. And I’m god
damn fucking fed up with you. Shit.
The both of you can go to hell, for
all I care.

He moves some papers and files around on his desk.

JACK (CONT'D)
The hell with you both. ft’'s all
shit. Complete and utter shit. What
have I ~- Jesus.

He stops, looks at his desk clutter, shakes his head mutters.

JACK (CONT’D)
Just god damn year in and year out.
Sitting across the desk from
this... And we pretend we're doing
something. And you pretend you've
heard us. And if we fall for it you
get out and a year later you're
back in here sitting across the
desk again. And somebody out there
is hurt, or dead. Well, I'm not
buying - ...Nothing gets better.
It's all bullshit. No one changes
for the better. And I've spent my
whole adult life doing this
BULLSHIT and I'm sick to death of
it. It's all a fucking WASTE!

He blasts in Stone's face.
SACK (CONT'D)
You get no more of my time, pal.
Get the hell out of here.

Stone waits a moment, then stands.
 

 

 

STONE
Man...You got anyone?

JACK
What the hell do you mean?

STONE
Anybody to stand behind you? Or are
you all alone?

JACK
I said get out of here.

STONE
Listen, you go ahead and blow your
motherfucking life up. Do it, man.
Blow it up. All of it. All the way.
Tt helps.

JACK
(punches intercom)
Dickerson call Peterson, we're
done.

DICKERSON (0.S.}
He's coming.

JACK
(into com)
Now goddamn it!!

STONE
Embrace it, man. Burn it up. It’s
awesome .

Jack goes and flings open his door. The Guard - Peterson - is

right there.

JACK

Did you not fucking hear me?
PETERSON

Get him out of here.
The guard takes Stone’s arm and leads him out.

Jack and Madylyn eating dinner at the table.

then gces to the phone and snatches it up.

Hello? (listens, relieved) Oh hey.

Holds the phone out to Madylyn

Madylyn frowns at the odd comment and takes the phone.

Jack goes back to eating.

EXT. MABRY FRONT PORCH ~ EARLY EVENING 125

They sip their drinks. Madylyn is going through the mail.
But it’s all hanging there between them.

ON JACK: his jaw muscle pulsing slowly, trying to find words.
A CICADA is BUZZING...a LOW HUM...

MADYLYN (0.8.)
Did you know you started out as
stone...?

He turns...did he hear that right?

JACK
What'd you say?

Madylyn is reading a pamphlet from the mail stack.

MADYLYN
Your soul. It started out as a
mineral or a pebble. And then it
was reincarnated as a plant, then
as a fish...birds, animals and so
on. You had toe work your way up to
being human. You know what it's
been doing...your soul?

He's looking at that pamphlet...he knows it. We can see a
piece of the word “; "on it...

 

JACK

What...

MADYLYN
It’s been paying off debts. Past
sins from past lives, reducing its
burden from one life to the next...

JACK
until...?

MADYLYN
Until “you are cleansed by Sound
and Light and see your true
Nature”.

She tosses it down dismissively. Jack is paranoid...

JACK
(trying to be casual)
Where'd you get that?

MADYLYN

Junk mail. Better than those
people at the door I guess.

(sips)
You know what I think?

(looks at Jack)
I think we get this one life. I do.
And you account for what you've
done in it here and if you don’t
you pay for it when you die.
Forever.

JACK
Ah, shit...

MADYLYN
You don’t think?

He shakes his head. That‘’s not what he means...he’s
struggling to speak... She looks away.

She takes

JACK
Mad, there’s something I want to
say...

MADYLYN
Mm?

a siow breath and turns to him waiting for it.

JACK
I’m sorry....I know I’ve been...

Well, sure she does...she’s

And it’s bothered you, this one.

sighs.

JACK
Well, hell. It’s a done deal now.

MADYLYN
You did what you thought was right.
That’s all you can do. ...The rest
is in God’s hands.

Madylyn takes a deep drag. They may have found a way past all
this...they can both feel it. Enough to invest in the same
interpretation of these events...

“Motherfucker”. Make me another

This gets him laughing
JACK

Shit.
They start almost really laughing...and then hear
SOUND OF A CAR SLOWING IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE.

MADYLYN is rising to go make drinks and she turns and Jack
looks up to see:

LUCETTA GETTING OUT OF HER CAR AND COMING ACROSS THE YARD.
Jack is frozen for just one beat, watching her come...

Seeing Lucetta, something in Madylyn’s face changes...a
knowing.

MADYLYN
Who is that?

LUCETTA
(calling out)
Hello!

MADYLYN
Is that her? Should you...

JACK
No. I'll take care of it...

And he’s moving...striding off the porch and down onto the
grass to intercept her,

JACK (CONT'D)
(so Madylyn can hear)
Mrs. Creeson...please...really...

He reaches her and moves to get between her and Madylyn. In
what follows Madylyn can see Jack's back and glimpses of
Lucetta but can’t see Jack’s face or hear all of it...
 

 

 

86.

JACK (CONT’D)
(sotto ~ deadly)
Have you lost your fucking mind-

LUCETTA
I've been a little worried Jack ~
you haven’t returned any of my
calls and -

JACK
(louder)
I know you’re worried, I
understand...

Lucetta side~steps enough to see Madylyn and be seen by her.

LUCETTA
Hi, Mrs. Mabry!

Jack moves to counter her and grabs her other wrist, blocked
from Madylyn’s view. He leads her toward the car.

MADYLYN’S POV: Lucetta winces a little and looks down,
reacting to something. Madylyn steps forward against the

rail, jaw tightening.

JACK
{sotto ~ fast)
itm a we're done, Get in the
car and drive...

 

LUCETTA
{tearing up a little)
I don’t know why you're being like
this - why Stone’s acting so weird?
What did you tell him about us?

JACK
{sotto - murderous)
There is no "us", Get out of here.

MADYLYN’S POV: they seem to be talking - is she resisting his
grip? Is he tightening it and forcibly moving her along?

ON MADYLYN‘S FACE: Something dying in her eyes...
Lucetta separates from Jack and gets in the car.
LUCETTA

ZT just needed to talk - I thought
we were friends.

Jack stands staring daggers at her. Hate. Still and unmoving
making sure she starts the engine and drives. Watching,
locked on the car as it drives away.

And then he walks back to the porch. Madylyn is waiting for
him, examining him.

He mounts the steps, feeling Madylyn’s glare.

MADYLYN
She was upset...

JACK
There’s no excuse...coming to my
home?
He's at the door...

MADYLYN
You don't have to be cruel, do you?

He turns on her...in his face, an expression she hasn't seen
in quite some time...he barely pulls it back...

He goes inside.

INT. WARDEN'S OFFICE - DAY 126
The Warden leans back in his chair holding the Creeson file.

WARDEN
You know we can’t alter reports

Jack stand across from him.

JACK
I know but I made a mistake.

WARDEN
Well you're only human.

Stu, I'm asking you. Please.

WARDEN

Jack stares him - holding ground.

WARDEN (CONT’/D)
Buddy...1I need something more to go

JACK
I know. I know. But - it’s

That’s all he wants to say. The Warden nods slowly.

WARDEN
You want to plead your concerns,
fine. You want to submit additional
evidence, that’s okay too. But you
know we’re clearing big numbers
right now ~ his fate’s already been
decided. It's out of our hands
Jack. It's luck and quotas.

Jack isn’t breathing.
JACK
And nothing I say is going to make
any difference.
The Warden stands to usher him out.
WARDEN
You know I don’t just push your
paper...but there’s a bigger wheel
turning right now.
Jack is white. The warden wraps a friendly arm around him.
WARDEN (CONT’D)
Don't sweat it Jack. You’re less

He claps him on the shoulder.

He looks at the clock. Adjusts his back. He loosens his tie
or his collar a little bit. Warm. Looks across at...

Stone: sitting in the chair across from him. Calm. Watching
him. He's dressed in civilian clothes.

Jack adjusts a file on his desk. Checks his watch.

STONE
You want to talk about it?
JACK
What's that?
STONE
Her coming.
JACK

Huh?

STONE
Or anything.

Jack stares at him a long beat, then laughs and shakes his
head, He’s hot, wipes his brow quickly and gets up to go
open a window.

STONE (CONT’D)
I’m concerned about you. You're
looking pretty haggard.

JACK
(over his shoulder)
Yeah, well...set your mind at ease.

He comes back, avoiding the chair but there’s nowhere to go
really so he sits.

STONE
I guess this is it for us, huh? You
got any more questions for me?

JACK
(impatience creeping in)
You better be smart or you'll right
back in here.

STONE
I got my release, Jack. I’m out.
There’s no reason for you to
concern yourself abcut me from now

Jack leans forward, speaking low and hard. No pretense.

JACK
Yeah, you got it...make no mistake,
T can have them watch your ass

Jack leans back. Lights up another cigarette.

He opens the door and calls down the hall...

JACK (CONT'D)

She’s coming. Don’t you like

Not me, boy. Time for you to go.

JACK
Here we go...

He goes back behind his desk and composes himself.

Lucetta suddenly appears in the doorway behind Jack with the
guard, Dickerson.

Jack turns - really rattled by her appearance.

JACK (CONT‘D)
Ms. Creeson.

Lucetta has dark circles under her eyes and stares at Jack
with ill-concealed disdain.

Stone, standing, smiles at her.

Lucetta glances at Stone who is beaming, relaxed. Lucetta
does not even smile at him. She bites her lip. Uncertain.

JACK (CONT’D}
Happy day.

All three are in a new, untried place, all awkward.
LUCETTA
(softly)
You ready?

STONE
You bet.

She stares at him, sick of this, and wary of what it may mean
in her life.

He smiles at her benignly ~ a different Stone than she knows.
Clear-eyed. He turns to Jack.

STONE (CONT'D)
Can I kiss her?

Jack nods. Stone moves oddly to her ~ it’s been years. She
wonders - is he shorter than when he went in?

They kiss. But not really connecting.
LUCETTA
(Cold, almost sad)
Ready to go home?

STONE
Oh yeah. f want barbeque.
 

 

 

93.

JACK
{forcing a smile)
Well. Good luck to you, Stone.

Stone turns and extends his hand to Jack. Jack takes it
reluctantly. Stone holds it longer than necessary and Jack
awkwardly disengages.

STONE
Thanks for all you've done.

JACK
Good luck to you too, Ms. Creeson.

LUCETTA
Lucetta, Jack...please. We're all
friends now, right?

She and Stone stare at him. He can’t read between the lines
and he’s sweating now.

JACK
Lucetta. Take good care of him.

LUCETTA
Oh, Twill. And listen, you take
good care too, oid man.

She goes out into the hall and follows Dickerson.

DICKERSON
You make a damn good cookie, honey.

Stone starts after them and Jack starts to let out a breath,
relieved. Then Stone steps back into the door and into the
room.

STONE
Oh, I meant to say...Lucetta told
me you fucked her.

Jack stands frozen. Does not respond or betray anything.

STONE (CONT'D)
That‘s got to be against some kind
of rules around here.

JACK
God damn.

STONE
Your life looks like shit, don't
it?

JACK
Shut up.

STONE

See you down the road.

He leaves. Jack stares after him. What did he mean by that?

INT. MABRY HOME - LIVING ROOM - MORNING 134

Madylyn is alone at home. Drinking. Already a little drunk.

INT. MABRY HOME ~- LIVING ROOM ~ NIGHT - LATER 135

Door opens and Jack enters.

He finds Madylyn out cold on the

couch. Her bottle and glass on the coffee table. He lifts her
hanging arm up to rest it on her chest. Puts a blanket on
her. Takes the bottle and glass...

EXT. MABRY HOME ~- FRONT PORCH - NIGHT 136

Jack alone on the porch drinking. Standing in the dark, no
lights on. Stares into the night. Cicadas buzzing.

A CAR DRIVES BY, the brake lights come on as it slows in
front of the house. Jack tenses, watching it as it pulls on

away. He goes inside.

INT. MABRY HOME ~ BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 137

Jack puts his GUN in the bedside drawer and lies down. Stares

at the ceiling.

INT. MABRY HOME - KITCHEN ~ NEXT MORNING 138

Jack serves eggs and toast, banging the plates down, in a
foul mood.

Madylyn sits at the table, her face flushed red. There is an
empty highball glass by her and a Jack Daniel’s bottle
nearby.

Madylyn lightly pushes the eggs away and finishes her drink.

Jack looks at her - daring her to pick up the bottle. She
picks up “Daily Devotions” booklet.

MADYLYN

Oh!...okay...um...

(Reads)
“The glory revealed to Moses is not
God's bodily splendor but that of
his moral being. Moses’s immediate
response is submission and
worship.”

(She clears her smoker's

throat)
“A vision of the glory of God often
has that effect.”

This strikes her funny and she chuckles.

MADYLYN (CONT’D)
- T’ll bet. ...Um...
(Reads silently)
-+.S0 we're getting to the
commandments next, I guess, huh?

She takes a sip from her already empty glass. She looks up at
him watching her.

MADYLYN (CONT’D)
Um...T heard a cute story the other
day. You want to hear it?

JACK

Do you believe in all this?
MADYLYN

What?
JACK

Do you...?

He stops. She stares at him hard. Hands him the book.
 

 

 

96.

MADYLYN
You read the meditation.

He takes it and reads...

JACK
“What request is on the top of my
prayer list for today? Is it a
selfish request? Or one that will
bring God glory?... After I yield
myself to the Lord, like Moses,
will my “top request” be
changed?”...

He stops with the book open.
MADYLYN
---I know what I want, how bout
you?

Jack looks up at her, empty.

MADYLYN (CONT’D)
Lost your place again?

He can’t speak.

MADYLYN (CONT‘D)
You got something you want to say

to me?

JACK
No.

MADYLYN
You don’t.

JACK
I can’t -

MADYLYN
What?

JACK

I can‘t even think of what you
would want me to say.

He pushes the door to the kitchen open to check and is met
with

FLAMES. THE KITCHEN WALL IS FULLY ON FIRE. FLAME ALREADY
CURLING UP ONTO THE CEILING.

He lurches back. It's too far gone already to think about an

No response. He runs for the bedroom and throws the door

Madylyn is lying in bed with her photo album on her chest
eyes closed. She seems to have not been woken by him. We

might not even notice that there is a bottle of pills with
the cap off and a glass of water on her night table.

JACK
MAD!

She turns to him groggy.

MADYLYN
Hmmm?

JACK
It's a fire. We've got to move.

She’s slow to respond and rips the covers back and grabs
her and we CUT:

JACK

Jack stops - ideas racing through his head ~- doesn't have
car keys, or a phone...

Madylyn stands at a distance, watching the fire. Berily
calm.

INT. BAR/RESTAURANT - NIGHT 155
Jack’s Retirement Party:

Jack's co-workers - WARDEN, Dickerson, Janice, Peterson,
and as twenty others cheer and clap. Jack smiles
uncomfortably under a GOOD LUCK ON THE OUTSIDE banner.

LARRY
He's free! He's free!

No sign of Madylyn.

TIMECUT: Jack having drinks and accepting congratulations 155A
from colleagues. There’s a muted awareness that it’s been a
tough time for him and people are trying to be cheery.

DICKERSON
(drunk, laughing it up)
You won't have me to kick around
any more! Better get a dog!

SOME GUY
{laughing}
That's what wives are for!

Uncomfortable glances all around. Jack shrugs it off with a
small laugh.

TIMECUT: Jack’s at a table with Janice. They're huddled up155B
sharing war stories and advice and he’s making her laugh. She
appreciates his advice and it seems cozy. He’s definitely had
too much but he still seems to be keeping it together.

JACK
but do not..f mean reall DO NOT
make it a two-way conversation.

JACK (CONT'D)
They got nothing but time to think
about how to work on you...get
under your skin. You can’t make
yourself a person with them.

JANICE
Oh believe me... learned that
lesson.

JACK

They'll test you for sure...
{looks at her)
Good looking woman like you...

He smiles. He puts his hand on her knee out of sight of
anybody else. Janice takes it in and looks at him nicely.

JANICE
(soft)
Jack...

JACK
(grins)
I’m retired, not dead you know.

 

JANICE
C'mon, we're friends, you're the
best...

JACK
A little fun...send me off into the
sunset...

He leans in a little. She’s uncomfortable but she’s trying to
be cool.

JANICE
Uh uh...let’s keep it pro, okay?

He stares at her a long time. She can’t tell if he’s
depressed or just going to nod and drop it. But he keeps
staring at her and it gets dark. He starts talking very low,
so only she can hear. From a distance nobody could tell they
weren’t just chatting.

JACK
Want to be a pro? Fuck you, pro.
They're going to chew you alive in
there,

JANICE
Jack -

Janice 1s shocked almost to tears. Warden arrives with darts,
plays it cool.

WARDEN
C'mon buddy, let‘s take these kids
On...

Janice stands and so does Jack. He’s still staring like a
cobra at Janice but she’s trying to make it easy...

JANICE
Okay, I’m in...

Jack leans toward her aggressive...we see how drunk he
actually is.

JACK
Up yours...

Warden grabs him back

WARDEN
Whoa, whoa buddy...all good fun...

Jack actually resists for a second then shrugs it off.
Immediately embarrassed.

JACK
(slurring)
Sorry...not your fault.
He holds out his hand to Janice
JACK (CONT‘D)
Hey...Not your fault. I'm all
fucked...- I should go.
Everybody's feeling bad for him.

EXT. BAR/RESTAURANT -— NIGHT 156
Jack exits, stumbling a little. He gets in his car and fires
it up.
EXT./INT. STREET/JACK’S CAR - NIGHT 157

Jack drives. Focused on something. Simmering.

EXT. LUCETTA’S APARTMENT - NIGHT 158

Jack sits in his car. Waiting and watching. The door opens
and STONE emerges. He walks off down the dark street. Jack
opens the glove box and takes out his GUN, gets out of the
car and follows him on foot.

TIGHT ON: Stone - as he looks up and double takes.

STONE‘S POV: Jack is blocking his path.

They stare at each other a long time. Still. Jack
approaches. He's clearly off balance but he's boring into
Stone with his eyes. He pulls his hand out of his jacket
pocket, showing the edge of his gun.

EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT 159
Shadowy. One high light in an adjacent parking lot throwing a
pool of light into the alley. Jack and Stone come along the
back wall of the market. Jack stops him against a wall just
on the edge of lights.

A STREET LIGHT IS BUZZING OVERHEAD...

STONE
dack, what‘s...

JACK SHOVES HIM HARD AGAINST THE WALL, GUN OUT AND RIGHT IN
STONE'S FACE...
107.

 

Jack's face tight with rage. Stone is oddly calm, observing
him, not fighting.

JACK
{drunk}
What’d you do?

Stone looks quizzical.

JACK (CONT’D)
Why did you do this?

Stone just smiles and shakes his head.

JACK (CONT'D)
You think I won't!

THE BUZZ OF THAT LINE IS TURNING INTO A DRONE, VIBRATING.
Stone's eyes seem to widen a little. JACK COCKS THE GUN.

JACK (CONT'D}
You think I won't!

Jack bores into him, demanding that he accept the blame for
it all. But Stone just stares at him and shakes his head the
tiniest bit. Jack threatens with the gun, bullying...but his
biuff has been called.

 

STONE eases out of his grasp and walks away. He doesn’t even
look back. He just walks out of the pool of light and into
the shadow and disappears around the corner.

THE SOUND is loud...humming.

Jack is alone with himself, nobody else to blame.

Jack HOWLS, looks at the gun...

WE CUT TO BLACK AND THE SOUND STOPS.

160 EXT. CANDACE’S HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY 160
BRIGHT SUN. A BEE buzzing around brings us to...

CANDACE 40’ish, with her father’s black hair, is putting
sunscreen on a little girl, 4 years old, who is protesting.

CANDACE
I know sweetie. But it’s the
sunburns you get now that give you
the cancer later.

 
 

 

 

108.

MADYLYN, watching. Gives her daughter a look of admonition.

MADYLYN
Who knew? We didn’t know. If we'd
known, of course we would
have...done differently.

Madylyn takes a drag from her cigarette and turns the page,
looking at the photo album. Candace lets Katie go.

CANDACE
You're greased.

Katie jumps up and down in a kiddie pool.

Candace joins her mother under the umbrella, taking a drag
from her mother’s cigarette and giving it back to her.
She peers down at the photo album

MADYLYN
{re the photos)
Cut-glass lamps.

CANDACE
Where is that?

MADYLYN
Place we used to rent at the beach.
You don’t remember it? You loved
playing in the water with your
father.

CANDACE
I love that shag carpet.

A long beat as they watch Katie.

CANDACE (CONT'D)
Don’t know how you stuck it out as
long as you did. I can’t believe
you didn’t dco this sooner.

MADYLYN
I almost did. Once.

CANDACE
What happened?

Madylyn doesn't answer. Just smokes.
MADYLYN

You have a limited point of view.
It got better. Gentler.

109,

Candace looks at her mother. Madylyn stares off into the
middle distance.

CANDACE
What are you thinking?

MADYLYN
I hope he’s eating.

Candace groans and gets up to go inside.

CANDACE
I’m monitoring your calls.

She leaves her mother. Madylyn stares and thinks.
The faint SOUND OF A BEE starts rising....
AND WE HEAR A MAN’S VOICE BEGIN TO SPEAK. Inarticulate and
strange, struggling to find the words...the voice runs over
the following scenes,
MAN'S VOICE (V.0.)
i ain’t know...how can I know?
INT. LUCETTA’S APARTMENT ~ SUNDAY MORNING i161
Stone is packing a small duffel bag. No Lucetta.
MAN'S VOICE (V.0.)
Ain’t nobody come into this place
and want to stay the same. That I
know for sure.
EXT. CITY ROAD ~ CONTINUCUS 162

Stone with duffel bag, looking around

A POWER LINE IS HUMMING, merging with that SOUND FROM THE
BEE, growing subtly...

MAN’S VOICE (V.0.)
Do I deserve to be free?
INT. BAR ~ SUNDAY MORNING 163
Lucetta in a bar. Bartender brings a drink and points to a

guy down the bar. He nods at Lucetta. She gives her siren
smile.

There's a neon bar sign BUZZING.
MAN'S VOICE (V.0.)

I hope to he.
EXT./INT. PRISON ~ SUNDAY MORNING 164
Jack arrives at the complex he’s made into his life. Entering
the outside. Walking down a hall with a cardboard box in his
hand.
MAN'S VOICE (V.0.)
But I don’t know...
INT. PRISON ~ JANICE’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 165
Over the shoulder of JANICE, we see an INMATE, discussing
himself and we see that this is the man who has been talking
in VOICE OVER.
In the open door behind him, Jack crosses with the box...he
pauses only slightly to look in on the Inmate speaking then
moves on.
INMATE
I don’t know who get to make that
decision you know...
INT. PRISON - JACK’S OFFICE ~ CONTINUOUS 166
Entering he sets the box on his desk and surveys everything
that made up his life. And then he starts to box it up.
EXT. CANDACE‘’S BACKYARD - SUNDAY MORNING 167
Madylyn sits staring, smoking and thinking.

The BUZZING LOUDER NOW.

INT. BEDROOM SOMEWHERE - SUNDAY MORNING 168
Lucetta sits naked on the edge of a bed. A man's body out of
focus behind her. She's happily painting her toenails and
smoking. Takes a drag and stares into space.

The SOUND rising...

lili.

EXT. ROAD - CONTINUOUS 169

Weird light. Getting out into the empty spaces beyond a
city. But not beautiful. Neutral, uncertain.

STONE is walking along the road under power lines humming.
Unreadable. Impossible to tell where he's going or what he's
doing.

The Sound now powerfully vibrating...

INT. PRISON - JACK’S OFFICE ~ CONTINUOUS 170

Wide on Jack behind his desk with a box on it, room stripped
bare and empty. Jack's life is dismantled and packed up in
boxes. There is one last picture frame on the desk. We can't
see what it is. He picks it up and packs it up, looking down
into the box. He stands there, head down, lost in thought.

The SOUND is LOUDER NOW, CLEARER. VIBRATING.

Almost unconsciously Jack turns his head, towards the sound.
Just barely.

THE END
