NORMAN

THE MODERATE RISE AND TRAGIC FALL OF A NEW YORK FIXER

 

by

Joseph Cedar
EXT. CENTRAL PARK - EARLY MORNING 2
It is still dark outside.
The CNN clock over Columbus Circle shows: 5:25am.

NORMAN OPPENHEIMER (60) is standing next to a_bench
Central Park. He has EARPHONES in both ears. In his hand we
notice a METAL BUSINESS CARD HOLDER.

At this hour it is either fitness fanatics or true
workaholics who need to be in the office by 7am, exercising
in the park. Norman is watching these fanatics pass by.

INT. STARBUCKS - DAY 3

A shot of a PEN writing on a_| PAPER NAPKIN: It is a diagram
with lines and circles that loosely follows the names,
numbers and institutions as we hear them:

NORMAN (0.S.)
This is the idea, the Israeli
government is withholding about
three hundred million dollars of
tax receivables from the
Palestinian Authority. My idea is
to find someone here, someone like
Jo Wilf, or an Arthur Taub, who
would buy that debt. Pay the
Palestinians eighty or ninety cents
on_the dollar, assuming that the
Palestinians will take what they
can get at this point, and that the
Israeli government would have no
choice but to honor their debt to
an American financial institution.

We see PHILIP COHEN (40) listening to Norman in a crowded
Starbucks with a polite but very skeptical look on his face.

NORMAN (CONT'D)
(passing the napkin to
Philip)
Everybody wins. The Palestinians
get their money. Israel isn’t
making any political concessions,
and lets say it is Wilf - he
collects thirty or forty million or
worst case scenario - just the
interest for that debt.

PHILIP
Why would the Palestinians agree to
get less than the full amount?
NORMAN
Because it is better than getting
nothing.

Philip thinks about this for a moment.

(CONTINUED)

EXT. CENTRAL PARK - EARLY MORNING

PHILIP
That is actually a pretty good
idea.

NORMAN
It is. I've thought it through. I
just need someone who can do it.
(pointing at Wilf’s name
on the napkin
Isn't this the scale of the kind of
deals Wilf is looking for?

A tight shot of Norman in Central Park, smiling, recalling
this conversation with Philip. There is a strange excitement
in his expression. He pulls the earphones out of his ears.
Then back to:

INT. STARBUCKS - DAY

PHILIP
Yes, but I don’t know if he would
get involved in a political
situation like this... I mean, I
know he wouldn't.

NORMAN
All I_want_to do is present it to
him. I really think it serves
everyone. When something is good,
it’s good. This is good.

PHILIP
I don’t have direct contact with
Wilf. You know that, right?

NORMAN
But you have friends there. Don’t
you? This is your circle...

Philip has to consider this for a moment.

NORMAN cour’ D)
If you're not comfortable doing
this, I’1l understand. I can ask a
few other people I know... But I
wanted to show it to you first.

PHILIP
Bill Kavish. Do you know him? He
works for Wilf. He is a friend.
Have you heard his name?

NORMAN
Yeah. Maybe. Why do I know that
name?
EXT. CENTRAL PARK - EARLY MORNING 6

Back to Norman. One of the runners he sees is BILL
KAVISH(35).

We follow Bill, FROM NORMAN’S POV, as he finishes his run and
stops by a tree to stretch his muscles.

We focus in on Bill’s energized face as we continue to hear:

PHILIP (V.O.)
You know his family. His father was
Henry Kavish. You remember him? He
was a fund-raiser for Ort in the
Eighties. He got into some kind of
trouble. They caught him Shactly
some money. I don’t know exact
what happened there, but. they fi fired
him, his wife left him, his kid:
turned their backs on him. He died
alone and penniless. Bill is his
youngest son.

Norman is fixated on Bill’s face, his movement, studying him
with genuine human interest, as if looking for the emotional
scar his father left on him.

Norman has taken out one of his BUSINESS CARDS, holding it
between his fingers.

INT. STARBUCKS - DAY 7

Back to Philip and Norman.

NORMAN
Can you introduce me to Bill?
PHILIP
I haven't spoken to him in a long
time...
NORMAN

There is nothing to lose. If he is
not interested, he'll say he is not
interested... But if he is... You
never know...

PHILIP
I can give you Bill’s e-mail, but
I'd prefer not to send a formal
introduction. We represent clients
who do business with them... I
don’t want to be in a position
where I’m asking him for a favor.

NORMAN
You're doing him a favor... But
okay. That's Fine. Can I say we are
related? Can I say I’m your uncle?

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED: 7

PHILIP
No. Don’t make it a family thing.
It doesn’t sound good... It might
not be a good idea to mention my
name.

Norman clearly needs more than that. And Philip has to give
him something.

PHILIP (CONT'D)
You can say you know me. But please
don’t tell him you got his address
from me.

Norman nods his head with polite gratitude. Philip senses his
distress as he gets up to leave.

PHILIP (CONT'D)
I’m sorry I can’t be more helpful.
It’s tough. You’re like a drowning
man waving at an ocean-liner. How
do you get it to see you? Jo Wilf
is an ocean-liner. He doesn’t see
any of us...

NORMAN
But I’m a good swimmer. Don’t
forget that. As long as my head is
above water, I know how to tread.

With a pat on Norman's back, Philip leaves.

EXT. CENTRAL PARK - EARLY MORNING 8

We’re back at the park where Bill, still stretching, notices
Norman staring at him. Norman raises his hand in an innocent,
friendly gesture.

Bill has no idea who he is. He nods his head and continues
stretching, a bit suspicious of the friendly stranger.

Norman approaches him, handing him his BUSINESS CARD.

NORMAN
Good morning, Bill. Norman
Oppenheimer.

BILL
What the fuck? You’re stalking me
now??

NORMAN
I only need a few minutes of your
time. I know you are busy. Philip
Cohen might have mentioned me...

BILL
No. Excuse me. This is my private
time... please respect that. Call
the office.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

NORMAN
I’m in touch with your secretary
twice a day. Very nice lady, but
You don’t return my calls. What am
I supposed to do?

BILL
Let it go! Give up. Does Philip
know you're here? How did you even
find me?

NORMAN
It’s a good business opportunity,
Why should I let it go? I wouldn't
be here if it wasn’t time
sensitive. Just give me a minute to
explain. A very igh official, I
can’t mention his name right now,
came to me with an offer to sell
his country’s tax receivables to a
third party...

Bill can’t believe he’s in this situation. He looks at Norman
as if he is a crazy man.

NORMAN (CONT'D)
Eighty cents on the dollar...

BILL
I'm sorry. I have to leave...
Excuse me. This is unacceptable.

NORMAN

(as Bill walks awa
Bill, I wouldn’t be doing this if I
didn't think it is worth ’Jo’s time.
Don’t trust me, trust Philip.
Sometimes good things come in
surprising ways... You never
know... You never know, right?
Worse comes to worse, he kicks me
out the door...

BILL

(turning around)
No - worse comes to worse, he kicks
ME out the door. It’s my job to
keep peopie like you away. Don’t
you get that? Please, respect my
position. Stop: Just stop. I’m
sorry. But I don’t know what else
to say.

Bill waits to see if Norman is internalizing the finality of
his response.

NORMAN
So I’ll tell my partners we had a
good conversation... and we’ll see
what happens. Okay?

Bill shakes his head with disbelief and walks away.

NORMAN (CONT’D)
Thank you, Bill.

EXT. 57TH ST. AND 7TH AVE - DAY 9

Norman is standing across the street from a DINER called
BROOKLYN DINER at the floor of a huge office building.

He is looking through the windows of the diner at Bill
Kavish, now dressed in his business suit, sitting with a few
other businessmen in one of the booths. The man in the center
of this Breakfast gathering is JO WILF (70), authoritative,
calm, allowing the younger men around him to do all the
talking.

Norman pulls out his phone and dials.

NORMAN
I got a meeting!

INT. PHILIP’S OFFICE - SAME TIME 10
PHILIP

With Jo Wilf??
Right before Norman answers, Bill Kavish raises his eyes and
catches Norman’s glance, standing outside. Bill give hima
viciously protective look.

NORMAN
Better. With Arthur Taub.

We sense that Philip doesn’t believe Norman.
PHILIP
If Jo Wilf is an ocean-liner,

Arthur is a nuclear submarine...
How did you manage that?

NORMAN
(walking away)
I told you, I’m a good swimmer.

Our view expands to see Norman walking away and blending into
the Midtown bustle. This image gradually goes out of focus.

INT. BARCLAYS MANHATTAN HEADQUARTERS- MORNING 12

 

Norman walks into this vast, intimidating lobby.

He approaches a reception desk underneath a sign that reads:
“Barclays Oil and Gas Exploration Conference”

Norman causally stands in line with a few other business
people waiting to register.

INT. CONFERENCE AUDITORIUM - DAY - MOMENTS LATER 13

 

Norman has a name-tag over his chest pocket. It reads: NORMAN
OPPENHEIMER

He wanders into a medium size auditorium in the middle of a
panel discussion, quietly finding a seat in the back of the
room.

THE ROOM IS FULL OF BANKERS AND FINANCE EXECUTIVES. From a
distance Norman blends in, but a closer look at how he is
dressed, exposes that he clearly does not belong.

On stage, with a backdrop of images of massive oil drilling
rigs, there is a MODERATOR and a GUEST SPEAKER--

RON MAOR(65) a minister in the Israeli Parliament.

They are discussing geopolitics and the energy market, but
our focus is Norman’s POV, scanning the room.

He is hunting for something, focusing on different
individuals, men and women, their name-tags, their japtop PS,
gadgets, briefcases, shoes, different items that catch his
attention. While in the B.G.

RON MAOR

(heavy Israeli accent)
I told the American leadership, at
a very high level, probably more
than half a year ago. Go to the
Russians. They hold the keys. They
know the commanders of these units
of chemical warfare on a first name
basis. Some of them are married to
Russian women. The most effective
way to protect this potentially
dangerous arsenal, is by getting
into contact with the Russians. But
it should be a real contact without
a drop of arrogance. Understanding
in advance that, okay, America lead
in Iraq, Europe lead in Libya, now
ask the Russians to lead and acce)
the fact that they will have a cote
in resolving this conflict.

MODERATOR
Suppose someone says you can’t
trust them.

MODERATOR (CONT'D)

You would say it is not a matter of
trust but of national interest...

Norman has fished a MIKE AND IKE candy out of his coat
pocket. He sucks on it without calling attention to himself.

MAOR
There is clearly a problem, it
relates to the Chinese and the Far
East as well. It is a major
question in the next decade for all
the other allies around the Pacific
Rim. Is America pushing Russia away
from the West and into the arms of
China? Some natural gas experts in
this room will say that is exactly
what _they’re doing by encouraging a
pipeline between Israel and Turkey.
Inevitably you will have a
symbiotic relationship with China,
based on currency trade,
whatever... But as I always say,
when dealing with global interests,
we shouldn’t be playing backgammon,
shesh-besh, you know. Where you
roll the dice and hope for the
best. We should be playing chess.

As this is going on, Norman has locked his glance on:
MICHA ESHEL.

He is in his mid 40s, handsome, well dressed. He is sitting
in the front row near the door, with an expression that is
saying that he has heard all this before and that he is not
very impressed with Mr. Maor on stage.

INT. OUTSIDE THE AUDITORIUM - LATER 14

 

A buffet lunch is being served. The ATTENDEES are mingling.

Maor is the center of the room, everyone is trying to get a
word with him.

But there is a SMALLER GROUP OF PEOPLE greeting Eshel as well
on the other side of the room.

It_is as if these two important men, Eshel and Maor, while
polite to each other and perfectly pleasant, are actually on
apposing teams.

Norman is following this dynamic very carefully, noticing how
they elegantly avoid eye contact with each other.

At a certain point Maor is escorted out of the room by his
security guards and entourage.

Eshel watches Maor leave. While Norman is watching Eshel.

INT. AUDITORIUM - LATER 15
The room is now three-quarters empty.
In this panel, Micha Eshel is the main attraction.

He speaks with much less pathos and with considerable humor
and ease. THE FEW PEOPLE that stayed to hear him, seem to
enjoy his sarcasm. Norman is sitting in the back, listening.

ESHEL
The distinguished minister speaking
before me, who I have a great deal
of respect for, seems to know a lot
about everything, and it is hard to

argue with him... god forbid, I’m
not saying he is wrong... China,
Russia, America... He must know

what he is talking about. He is my
boss, after all. And a very good
chess player.

(slightest smile. Audience

laughs)
But you know, George Bernard Shaw
once said - some people see the

way things are and ask why.

I see how things should be and ask -
why not?! Mr. Maor is very good at
describing the world as it is. If
you ask me, I think our job is to
discuss how the world should be.

INT. BARCLAYS MANHATTAN HEADQUARTERS - LOBBY - LATER 16

Eshel is acceptin compliments | from the few people who are
walking with him toward the exit.

Norman is tailing behind.

He follows Eshel out the doors, watching him as he says
goodbye to all the people around him - ‘surprisingly
remaining all alone on the Midtown sidewalk, without any
entourage or security. Eshel puts on his sunglasses takes

in the busy street as if deciding where to go, then heads
Uptown.

Nozman peels off his name-tag from his jacket and follows
Eshel.

EXT. OUTSIDE BARCLAYS HEADQUARTERS- CONTINUOUS 17

Eshel stops at a traffic light. Norman is close behind him.

EXT. CHOCOLATIER ON MADISON AVE. - DAY 18

 

Eshel has entered a gourmet chocolate store.

CONTINUED: 18

Norman carefully peeks into the store window to see Eshel
casually sampling chocolate.

Norman considers going inside, but there is something
intimate in the way Eshel is savoring the chocolate that
Norman knows would embarrass Eshel if interrupted.

So Norman waits outside as Eshel moves over to the cashier
with a bag of MILK CHOCOLATE COVERED CASHEWS.

Norman quickly ducks out of Eshel’s eye-line

INT. MEN'S CLOTHING BOUTIQUE, NYC - DAY 19

From inside the shop and its exquisitely designed display
window, we see out toward Madison Ave.

Different Upper East Side types cross the window.

Then Eshel stops by the window. He looks inside at a pair of
BEAUTIFUL CALFSKIN SHOES set on a pedestal. The shoes are the
centerpiece of the window display.

He is munching out of a his BAG OF CHOCOLATES.
Then we see NORMAN walk by the shop.

Norman looks at Eshel for a moment, making believe he is
recognizing him for the first time.

Eshel turns around. Norman introduces himself. They shake
hands. They talk for a bit. They are referring to something
in the display window.

Norman is laughing. So is Eshel.

They stop laughing and continue conversing about something
both of them seem to agree on.

Eshel offers Norman a chocolate from his bag. Norman firmly
declines. Then Norman opens the door to the shop and allows
Eshel to enter before him. Only now do we hear them, mid
conversation:

NORMAN
-.-I’d be hap ppy to introduce you to
him. Let me tell Arthur you are in
town. I’m going to his dinner
tonight. You can join me.

ESHEL
How do you know Arthur Taub?

NORMAN
wy wife used to baby-sit him. Then
e ended up working for him, years
later. They were very close.
(pulling out his cell
phone)

NORMAN (CONT'D)
Let me tell him you’re here, I’m
sure he would be happy if you came
tonight.

Eshel examines Norman’s face. His ghothing - His hair. There
is something about his appearance that makes Eshel want to
think this over.

ESHEL
Hold on a second. Put the phone
back...

Norman puts the phone back in his pocket. THE SALES PERSON,
who has been waiting for an opening in their conversation,
greets the two gentlemen.

SALES PERSON
Good Morning. Welcome to Lanvin. My
name is Jacques.

ESHEL
We are just looking around for now.
Thank you.

JACQUES
I am very happy to assist you
today... Come inside.

NORMAN

Mr. Eshel is speaking at a very
special event later this week and
has a series of meetings with
business leaders and diplomats. He
would like to try on the shoes in
the window.

Jacques puts his hand under his chin and looks at Eshel,
taking in the clothing he is currently wearing and his
general style.

Eshel humors him by posing with his hands folded under his
chest.

JACQUES
May I ask what line of business you
are in?

ESHEL

I don’t want to ruin my good first
impression, but I am a politician.

NORMAN
This is Mr. Micha Eshel. He is the
minister of trade and labor in
Israel and deputy to the prime
minister.

ESHEL
No. I’m the deputy minister of
trade and labor.

ESHEL (CONT'D)
My boss, the minister, is a deputy
to the prime minister, but there
are three other deputies, just to
put things in context.

JACQUES
It is an honor to meet you, Sir.
I’m sorry, but you looked too young
to be... so important.

ESHEL
Thank you for the very flattering
lie, You have a future in
politics... which is more than I
can say for myself. I might be
young, but I’m already washed up.
I’m just kidding. Very nice to meet
you, Jacques.

____ JACQUES
§gincerely
You don’t look washed up.

ESHEL
Thank you. That’s because I’m in
New York now. New York makes me
feel good. Back home, I look tired.

NORMAN
No you don’t. I’ve seen your
appearances on TV. You look great.

ESHEL
That is because I’m very
photogenic...

NORMAN
No, you are one of the few Israeli
politicians who radiates optimism.

ESHEL
Optimism... The shoes I buy today
will last longer than the
government I serve in.

NORMAN
Change is good. That’s what I was
told.
JACQUES
The fashion world relies on change.
ESHEL
And the Middle East relies on - how
do you say stagnatzia?

NORMAN
Stagnation.

(CONTINUED)

ESHEL
Stagnation. Once you’re in power,
you don’t want anything to change.
You can ask my boss about that...

ORMAN,
Do you think he'll become prime
minister?

ESHEL
Maor? If he does, It’1ll be a joke.

NORMAN
What about you? Would you ever
consider running?

ESHEL

Me?

(eating a chocolate)
You know what the problem with
modern leadership is? To be a real
leader, you need to have a firm
idealogy, you have to really know
what is right, and never look to
the sides...

(illustrating with his

hand)
Straight. But in order to get
elected, you need to be the
opposite of all that. That’s the
tricky part.

ORMAN
Something tells me that you can do
both hink you would be a great
candidate.

ESHEL
Only magicians can do two things at
the same time.
(to Jacques)
So what do you say?

JACQUES
The event you are attending... It
is in the evening, yes?

ESHEL
Yes. But I think people will be
coming straight from work. I don’t
think they’re getting dressed up
especially for this.

NORMAN
Of course they are. It’s not black
tie, but this is going to be a
classy crowd. It’s at the Waldorf
Astoria.

(CONTINUED)
14.
CONTINUED: 19

Eshel has casually picked up a shoe to see the price. We see
it as well: $1045!

NORMAN (CONT’D)
(to Jacques)
The press will be there too...

ESHEL
(returning the shoe)
Forget the shoes. Nobody is going
to be looking at my shoes. Maybe,
can I see your ties...

He walks over to the tie display.

NORMAN
What size shoe are you? A ten?
Eleven? Just try them on. We’re
already here.

ESHEL
No. I’m not getting shoes now.
(picking up a beautiful
tie)

NORMAN
(handing the shoe to
Jacques )
We'll try these on for Mr. Eshel.

Jacques walks over to one of the racks, looking for
something.

JACQUES
I think I have a better idea.
take some measurements, Mr. she >

ESHEL
No. Really, I don’t want to take up
your time. Thank you. How much is
this tie?

Norman moves in closer to Eshel, taking the tie from his
hand.

NORMAN
Let’s see what he comes up with.
Don’t say no before you try it on.
(reassuring him with eye
contact)
Don’t worry. Trust me. Enjoy it.
Let him do his job.

JACQUES
A young minister should not feel
washed up. Excuse me for saying.
Please... I can help with this. Let
me try something.

Eshel thinks about this for a brief moment, then playfully
submits himself to Jacques’ tape measure.

Norman, in the meantime, sneaks a peek at the price tag on
the tie: $195!!

INT. MEN'S CLOTHING BOUTIQUE, NYC - DAY - LATER 20

Eshel is now standing with his back to a set of THREE
MIRRORS. He is dressed in a new elegant suit, shirt and tie.

He looks, and more importantly - FEELS amazing. It is not too
flashy, it does not call too much attention to itself, but it
does give him a uniqueness that Eshel can feel even without
seeing himself.

Norman is reflected in all 3 mirrors, smiling.
Jacques is kneeling by Eshel’s feet, fixing his cuff.

ESHEL
(to Norman)
So you said your wife works for
Arthur Taub?

NORMAN
Used to work for him, yes. She
passed away.

 

ESHEL
I’m sorry.

NORMAN
This was years ago. But she was
very close to Arthur and I would be
more than happy if you joined me
tonight. He is someone you should
meet...

ESHEL
I’ve been hearing his name from a
few different people recently. He's
young, right? What’s he like?

NORMAN
(expertly)

There are two kinds of moguls. One
kind is like a big ocean-liner
ship, they make a lot of waves, and
noise, everybody can see them from
miles away... Like Jo Wilf. I think
Minister Maor is in his close
circle of friends.

Eshel takes note of that last point.

NORMAN (CONT’D)
And then there is Arthur, who is
more like a nuclear submarine.
Quiet. Fast. Young. And extremely
sophisticated.

(CONTINUED)
20

16.
CONTINUED: 20

ESHEL
Interesting...

NORMAN
He’s an interesting fellow. He
likes to surround Rimselt with
consultants who are in influential
political positions but with an eye
on the future. He has good
instincts about these things. And
he is very good about compensating
his consultants. You’d enjoy
meeting him.

Eshel takes this in.

SHEL
Maybe I’11 have my office contact

him. We’ll see... I’m not a private
person, you know... Not yet,
anyway.

NORMAN

Of course. But if you need ny help
reaching him, I’m happy to do it.
Even if it is just to plant a
seed...

ESHEL
Thank you.

NORMAN
Where are you staying while you are
here? How can I reach you?

We sense Eshel doesn’t want to answer that question. He looks
over at Norman, again trying to evaluate him.

Jacques at this point has helped him slip on a pair of
surprisingly simple looking shoes with a metallic brown tone
to them and ordinary laces.

ESHEL
Can I look at myself yet?

JACQUES
Please, Mr. Eshel, you can turn
around now.

Eshel turns around to look at himself. He is speechless.

The 3 mirrors create a triptych with the reflections of Eshel
and Norman in his background.

Eshel, looking carefully at his reflected image, tries a
facial expression that 1s contemplative and serious. Then he
fills his lungs with air, creating a more authoritative
impression.

Norman and Jacques are watching Eshel transform into what he
always imagined he could be.

(CONTINUED)
20

17.
CONTINUED: 20

But then Eshel looks down at the price tag on the suit
jacket. We see it as well: $6750!!

Then at the shirt price tag: $635!!

Eshel takes off the jacket as if it were on fire and hands it
to the surprised Jacques.

He then takes off the shoes and pulls off his pants.

ESHEL
Please, take all this away from me
before I get used to it. You are
right, it does make me feel
fabulous, but there is one rule
every Israeli politician learns in
the beginning of his career: you
cannot wear a suit that costs more
than an ordinary man’s car.
Israelis don’t want to see their
representatives enjoying
themselves. That is a fact. I’m
sorry for wasting your time.

NORMAN
But what if you didn’t know how
much it costs?

ESHEL
I do. It is too late.

NORMAN
to Jacques)
Could Mr. Eshel perhaps borrow the
suit for his event?

JACQUES
I can ask. We do that occasionally
with celebrities and red carpets.

ESHEL
No! I’m not borrowing it. I don’t
want to feel like Cinderella for
one night. I’m not a model, I'ma
member of parliament.

NORMAN
Then keep the shoes.
ESHEL
(handing the shoes to
Jacques )
No. Enough... I don’t want them.

Norman takes the shoes from Jacques.

NORMAN
Please. Let me buy you these shoes.
It would be my privilege to buy
them for you. If it makes an
Israeli leader feel good, that is
the least I can do.

(CONTINUED)
18.

20 CONTINUED: 20
ESHEL
No. Thank you. But no. I can’t.
NORMAN
(kneeling by Eshel with
the shoes)

Would you at least put them on one
more time. Go ahead. Just put your
feet inside, before you say no.

Eshel looks at Jacques, then at Norman, and finally slips his
feet back into the shoes. Eshel is now in his shirt, tie,
underwear, socks and - metallic brown dress shoes. He loves
these shoes! Norman pulls out his CREDIT CARD and gives it to
Jacques.

NORMAN (CONT’D)
We're taking them. I don’t want you
walking out of here empty handed...

ESHEL
(intercepting the card)
I can’t let you pay. If I take the
shoes, I have to pay for them.

NORMAN
It’s an expense for me. I write it
off. Don’t argue... I want to do
it.

ESHEL

The truth is, I can’t put that kind
of expense on my credit card.

NORMAN
You don’t have to. I got it.

Norman pushes Eshel’s hand away, nods to Jacques, who takes a
moment to confirm the transaction before he steps into a side
room with the credit card.

ESHEL
Yeah? You sure?

_. NORMAN
Yes. Positive. Don’t worry. I’m
happy to do it.

Eshel is looking down at Norman’s worn-out $40 shoes.

ESHEL
What about you? Why don’t you buy a
pair for Yourself? They really are
magical shoes

NORMAN
Me? No. I need special orthopedic
shoes, I have a very wide foot.
Don! t ask. I’ve got problematic
eet...

Jacques returns with the card and pen on a tray together with
the receipt.

Norman blushes with surprise when he looks at the receipt
before he signs it. We see the amount: $1137 (including tax)

Norman picks up the pen to sign, but right before he does, he
stops to look at Eshel who is putting on his old cloths.

ESHEL
Is everything okay?

Norman signs the receipt. Places the pen down with a dramatic
effect.

NORMAN
Everything is perfect! Enjoy!

JACQUES
Would you like to wear them out,
Mr. Eshel, or should I put them in
a box for you.

ESHEL
Please put them in a box. Thank
you. I’ll save them for the right
occasion.

He hands the shoes to Norman as if Norman were his assistant.
Norman hands the shoes over to Jacques to wrap in a box.

ESHEL (CONT'D)
Jesus. I just realized I’m terribly
late. I must run now. Thank you
very much.

(then to Norman)

I don’t know what to say. Thank you
for this. I’m glad I bumped into
you!

NORMAN
My pleasure.

ESHEL
(joking)
I should have taken the tie too...

NORMAN
Next time...

ESHEL
Next time.
(then...)
Here, take the chocolates. They’re
delicious.

NORMAN

I have severe nut allergies. One
wrong bite and I can drop dead.

Oh. Sorry. Specifically cashews?

NORMAN
No. Peanuts. But this is the one
area I don’t take any risks. Thank
you for offering.

ESHEL
(holding up a chocolate)
This can really kill you? What
happens if you take a bite?

NORMAN
If it has even the smallest trace
of a peanut, my body mistakes it
for a dangerous substance and
immediately shuts itself down. My
skin reacts, My eyes tear. My nose
starts running, and my throa
swells so that I can’t breathe.

Norman pulls out an EPIPEN injector from his pocket.

NORMAN (CONT'D)
If I don’t inject myself with one
of these, I can be dead in less
than fifteen minutes.

Eshel is impressed by this description.

He pops the chocolate he was holding into his mouth and
carefully places the bag of chocolates on the counter next to
Jacques, away from Norman.

Jacques nods with gratitude.
Eshel walks toward the exit of the fitting room.

NORMAN (CONT'D)
What about Arthur? Would you like
to meet him? Can I tell him you’1l
be coming with me tonight?

Eshel thinks about this for a moment. Finally--

ESHEL
Sure. Why not. It would be great to
meet him. I just need to check my
schedule. I’m staying at the
Warwick. Leave a message for me
there with the details.
Thank you, Norman...

NORMAN

Eshel walks back in, hands Norman his BUSINESS CARD, and taps
him on his shoulder in a friendly way.

ESHEL
Here. Take this. It has my private

when you are in Israel, Norman
Oppenheimer, if you ever peed
anything, feel free to call.

Norman pulls out his card holder and takes out his own
business card and hands it to Eshel.

NORMAN
And this is me. When you are in New
York, if there is anything I can
help "with, anything at all, please
let me know. And I711 call you
later.

ESHEL
(reading off Norman’s
card
Oppenheimer Strategies...

Eshel puts the card inside the shoe box.

On his way out with his shopping bag, he grabs a few final
chocolates from the bag he left on the counter.

Norman and Jacques watch him as he blends into Madison Ave.

Norman looks down at the card in his hand. We see it has the
official symbol of the state of Israel.

It reads: “MINISTRY OF INDUSTRY, TRADE AND LABOR. MICHA
ESHEL, DEPUTY MINISTER”. And on the other side, handwritten,
Eshel’s PRIVATE CELL PHONE NUMBER.

EXT. MADISON AVE - EVENING 21
Norman is walking and talking on the phone.

NORMAN
-.-I understand it is a sit-down
dinner. I don’t need a seat. Just
one seat for Mr. Eshel. I’11 stand.
I have to be somewhere anyway.

Norman stops walking. Distressed.

NORMAN (CONT’D
Please, don’t give me a final
answer until you speak with Arthur.-
- Micha Eshel. -- E. S. H. E. L.
Tell him he is the guy in charge of
regulating the energy industry...--

Norman hangs up, pulls out Eshel’s business card and dials.

INT. ESHEL’S HOTEL SUITE BATHROOM - SAME TIME 22

 

ESHEL’S PHONE RINGS just as_he enters his suite. He looks at
the number on the screen, places the phone on a table by the
door and heads toward the luxurious tub in the bathroom.

We stay on the phone while it continues to ring and Eshel
gets the water running in the tub.

EXT. ON NORMAN, MADISON AVE. - SAME TIME 23

 

Norman gives up, dials another number. After a moment.

NORMAN
Yes. Hi. Can you connect me _to Mr.
Eshel’s room... --So can I leave

INT. ESHEL’S HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT - LATER 24

 

Eshel, in a robe, AND WEARING HIS NEW SHOES, is speaking on
the phone. With:

INT. BEDROOM. JERUSALEM APARTMENT - NIGHT - ISRAEL 25

 

It is seven hours ahead and DUBY (60s), Eshel’s lawyer, a
small man with intense eyes and a no-nonsense demeanor, is
in bed, picking up a pen and note-pad from his night-table.
THEY SPEAK HEBREW.

DUBY
(as he writes down the
name Norman Oppenheimer)
Did he say what he does?

ESHEL
He’s a businessman. He has some
kind of investment fund. Not sure I
understood exactly... A warm Jew.

Duby is quietly stepping out of his bedroom so not to wake
his wife, taking the pad with him.

DUBY

You want to meet Arthur Taub, but
not through this guy Norman.

ESHEL
I have nothing better to do
tonight, why not join him?

DUBY
You can’t walk in there with
someone you just met and know
nothing about. These things are
important. If you want to meet
Arthur, let me set up a proper
meeting.

ESHEL
Are you sure? It seems harmless...

Duby by now is by his laptop, searching for NORMAN
OPPENHEIMER. Random faces come up, but none of them are
Norman. The further down he scrolis, the more pictures of
ROBERT OPPENHEIMER and images of ATOMIC EXPLOSIONS fill the
screen.

DUBY
I’m sure. One hundred percent sure.

Eshel has walked out onto the terrace of the suite.
ESHEL

I hear Taub is like some kind of -
nuclear submarine...

DUBY
Listen to me. We don’t even know
what this event is all about... I

don’t want you walking into an
uncomfortable situation. Go see a
movie. Go have a good meal. Should
I_ reserve a table for you at a nice
place?

ESHEL
I'll find something to do. Forget
it. Any press on my visit here so
far?

Duby is now looking at a NEWS WEBSITE on his computer screen
with a picture of RON MAOR in a photo-opp in NY with
important U.S. officials.

DUBY
No. Nothing special. It’s better
this way...

ESHEL

It’s crazy to see how they suck up
everything Maor says. I’m telling
ou, he is a dangerous man. He
iterally believes his own
bullshit... As if he is running the
entire world.

Duby is sensing the poison spreading in Eshel’s veins and
knows he needs to change the subject.

ESHEL

take him seriously? Can’t they see
he is as dumb as a shoe?

DUBY
I’m getting you tickets for a show!

ESHEL
No show. I’m not in the mood for a
show. I'll go get something to eat.
Don’t worry about me...
DUBY
Okay. Put it on your hotel bill.
They’re paying for it. And do me a
favor - stay away from the
Normans. I’m serious.
Duby disappears, we stay on Eshel.
He sits down on the sofa in his suite. He is restless.

His phone RINGS. He realizes it is Norman. He is tempted to
answer, but as per Duby’s instructions - he doesn’t.

Instead, he picks up the remote control and turns on the TV
as the phone continues to RING.

INT./EXT. UPPER EAST SIDE TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT - SAME TIME 26
Norman hangs up his phone.

He is waiting by the entrance as INVITEES pass him on their
way into a grand Upper East Side townhouse.

He steps out to the street corner, but no sign of Eshel.

He takes out his phone again. We see the screen. He is
calling - “Eshel Private Cell.” It rings and rings.

INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT 27

Eshel is sitting alone in a booth in a very expensive gourmet
restaurant, sipping WINE and enjoying a beautifully displayed
dish of oysters. His phone is BUZZING. He ignores it.

greeting his guests.

Arthur notices Norman from the corner of his eye.
Norman casually picks up a hors d'oeuvre from a passing
waiter, while he nods his head toward Arthur.

INT. TOWNHOUSE, DINING AREA - NIGHT 29

 

Norman has walked up to the second level of the house.

He examines the hors d'oeuvre in his hand - it looks like a
stuffed fig with an unidentified nut topping - Norman smells
it.

knowing he can’t eat it, he places it on a mantel behind a
decorative statue.

Then he peeks through the large doors leading into the formal
dining room. From Norman’s POV we see a long, fancy dinner
table with approximately 20 settings. Next to each setting
there is a name card.

Norman walks in, going over the name cards until he locates
the card that says MICAH ESHEL. It is a proud moment for him -—
to have literally secured (by proxy) a seat at the table.

He pulls out his phone and dials again. “Eshel private cell.”
He takes a deep, troubled breath as he realizes that Eshel is
not picking up.

INT. TOWNHOUSE. DINING AREA - LATER 30

The guests are now entering the dining area, finding their
seats around the table.

Norman is already sitting comfortably by the table, on the
seat marked for Micha Eshel.

He smiles nonchalantly at the guests as they take their seats
around him.

Arthur, who is talking to a few people on the other side of
the room, notices Norman sitting by the table.

He whispers something into the ear of A WOMAN standing next
to him. She is Arthur's assistant.

The smiling assistant approaches Norman. She leans down so
that she is very close to his ear.

The assistant leaves Norman waiting in this indoor basketball
court which apparently serves as Arthur's kids own all
purpose playroom. Norman looks around, taking in the
extravagant setting. He has his business card ready in his
hand. Arthur enters.

ARTHUR
Mr. Oppenheimer?

NORMAN
Norman. We met at the Stern
auction. M onute is friendly with
Lili. By t I can’t thank you
enough for ‘the ast_minute
invitation for Eshel.

ARTHUR
Where is he? Mr. Eshel.

NORMAN
He’s on his way. I just spoke to
him. He apologizes. He was held wu
in a meeting at the U.N., But he is
on this way...

ARTHUR
You just spoke to him now?

NORMAN
Yes. A few minutes ago.

Arthur is evaluating Norman. He seems amused, rather than
angry.

ARTHUR
How do you know Mr. Eshel?

NORMAN
I've been helping him out with some
of his American alliances. There
are some very interesting ideas he
is trying to promote... For

Once alone with Norman, Arthur's assistant’s smile
disappears. She opens a service door leading to the back
yard.

Norman takes his coat and hat, thanks the assistant with a
head gesture, then leaves.

EXT. UPPER EAST SIDE TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT 33

 

Norman, deflated, is sitting on a bench opposite the
townhouse.

He is emptying the last candy out of his box of Mike and
pkes, chewing on them obsessively, and scratching his collar
one.

From his POV, through the large windows of the townhouse, we
see Arthur and his guests enjoying their privileged dinner.

Norman rips apart the Gandy box to make sure it is really,
empty, then gets up and walks away into the dark park.

EXT. A SYNAGOGUE ON THE UPPER WEST SIDE - NIGHT - LATER 34

 

This is an old Upper West Side building.

Norman comes walking down the block. He stops by the
synagogue and presses his face against the glass door.

He tries the door. It is opened.
INT. SYNAGOGUE - CONTINUOUS 35
We hear a CHOIR and a CANTOR echoing in the foyer. Norman

steps into the main sanctuary, following the music.

INT. SYNAGOGUE - MAIN SANCTUARY - CONTINUOUS 36

 

A CANTOR and his CHOIR are rehearsing a cantorial piece in
this modest in size, but beautiful old New York synagogue.

The cantor acknowledges Norman with a slight head-nod, as he
continues the rehearsal.

Norman steps out and enters a small kitchenette off the main
sanctuary.
INT. KITCHENETTE - CONTINUOUS 37

Norman, hungry, finds a box of Ritz crackers on the counter
and a bottle of ginger ale.

He takes a fist-full of crackers and pours himself a paper
cup full of ginger ale. He opens the refrigerator and pulls
out a JAR OF PICKLED HERRING.

Just as he is about to place a piece of herring on a cracker,
he hears rapid footsteps descending down a staircase. Norman
quickly returns the cracker box and the jar to where they
were.

RABBI BLUMENTHAL, a 50 year-old beardless rabbi, emerges from
the stairwell, noticing Norman on his way out. He has the
energy of someone on speed.

RABBI BLUMENTHAL
Norman Oppenheimer! If you came to
hear my class, you’re a little
late...

NORMAN
If I had the time... If I only had
the time.

RABBI BLUMENTHAL
You’re busy. That’s good. Someone
has to make sure the world out
there is still spinning... What’s
new? Who’s winning? Who’s losing?
Tell me something exciting.

NORMAN
I just got back from a very special
evening. Fascinating people...
(casually)
At Arthur Taub’s house.

RABBI BLUMENTHAL
You were in Arthur Taub’s house?

NORMAN
I brought Micha Eshel with me. I
should introduce you to him. You
know who he is, right?

RABBI BLUMENTHAL
Say the name again...

NORMAN
Micha Eshel. He’s in the Israeli
parliament. Young. Charismatic.
Sharp - Very sharp.
I’m helping him out a bit...
showing him the ropes. I’m going to
help him raise some money.

We sense Rabbi Blumenthal is skeptical of Norman’s name-
dropping, but he plays along so not to offend him.

have you on his side.

Norman takes a handful of crackers before he exits--

INT. MAIN SANCTUARY - NIGHT 38

Norman quietly sits down on one of the benches and listens to
THE CHOIR AND CANTOR REHEARSE.

The entire wall in front of him is covered with MEMORIAL
PLAQUES. Hundreds of names engraved in bronze sheets on the
wall.

Norman pulls out his phone and looks down at the screen,
scrolling down his contact list, waiting, hoping, his phone
will ring. But it doesn’t.

He looks up. One name plaque in particular catches Norman's
attention. We close in on it: HENRY KAVISH

Norman had just stepped out of the s nagoque, but when he
tries to reenter, doors are now er

Before Norman answers the call, he walks around the building
into a narrow service alley where there are decorative
windows into the main sanctuary and rows of garbage cans.

The two men are now SUPERIMPOSED on the screen: Eshel, lying
on his back, holding the shoe up in front of his face, Norman
in the alley, by the garbage cans.

The CHOIR CAN STILL BE HEARD. It annotates the scene.

ESHEL
Is it too late to call?

NORMAN
No. Not at all. I just got back
from Arthur’s dinner.

ESHEL
I’m sorry I couldn't make it. It
was a crazy day. I’m really sorry.

NORMAN
That’s okay. No need to apologize.
We'll find another opportunity. I

I just wanted to say that to you.

NORMAN
Yes. I know what you mean..

on top of everything. Once you
taste it, you can’t settle for
anything less. Do you know that,

TITLE: THREE YEARS LATER

OVER _THE BLACK SCREEN WE HEAR: 43

ANNOUNCER
It is my great honor to welcome the
prime minister of the state of
Israel-- Micha Eshel...

A ROAR OF APPLAUSE AND ECSTATIC CHEERING, takes us into -

INT. WASHINGTON CONVENTION CENTER - NIGHT 44
This is a ballroom the size of a football field.

THOUSANDS OF MEN AND WOMAN are on their feet, applauding and
cheering.

We see the stage. It is the annual AIPAC convention in
Washington.

A single, official speaking podium is set in the center of
the vast, somewhat futuristically designed stage.

A MUSICAL INTRODUCTION (with pathos at the level of the Star
Wars theme) is playing on the PA, accompanying the entrance
of Micha Eshel, waving, smiling, overwhelmed by this IMPERIAL
welcoming.

ESHEL
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you Michael. Thank
you. Thank you all... Thank you.
Thank you...

But the applause won’t stop. Eshel absorbs it in. Allowing
the love to flow.

Our camera closes in on his unavoidable smirk, then slowly
moves down his body and stops on his - METALLIC BROWN SHOES.

Way, way back, far from the stage, Norman Oppenheimer is in
the audience, appiaudin with the masses, his name tag
dangling around his neck.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: 44

He is standing so far away from the stage, Eshel is too small
for Norman to see his face.

So Norman has his head directed at one of the large screens
in the ballroom, projecting Eshel’s exuberant face.

Norman is in tears. Tears of genuine excitement.

INT. HALL IN CONVENTION CENTER - LATER 45

 

A long line of MEN and WOMEN has formed around a highly
guarded reception area where Eshel and other VIPs are shaking
ands and greeting each other.

Norman is looking at Eshel from a distance. From his POV we
see Duby, Eshel’s lawyer who is now his chief of staff.

And HANNA (38) curly hair, nice smile and energetic eyes.

They are standing behind Eshel with cell phones in their
hands, whispering to each other and occasionally into Eshel’s
ear, monitoring the people who get to approach the new prime
minister.

Philip Cohen approaches Norman. He has a plate of PECAN PIE
WITH IPPED CREAM in his hand. Together they continue to
look at Eshel from a distance.

NORMAN
For once I bet on the right horse.
What were the odds? It is a
miracle.

PHILIP
Have you spoken to him yet? I mean
since he won?

NORMAN
We‘ve been exchanging messages.
It’s not that simple to reach him
anymore. He’s got a lot on his
plate.

PHILIP

And... from now on, I mean, how
does it work? Are you friends? How
close are you? Do you get to visit
him in his office? When he comes to
the States does he invite you to
have breakfast with him at Blair
House?

NORMAN
To tell you the truth, I don’t
know. From my side, I "want him to
know that I’m here for him if he
needs me.

(CONTINUED)

Philip looks at Norman, trying to evaluate how sincere he is.
Norman appears to be not only sincere - but truly moved by
the magnitude of this event.

PHILIP
Can you introduce me to him?

Norman looks at the long line of people waiting for their
turn with Eshel.

NORMAN
Of course! But let’s wait for the
right moment. I don’t want to push
myself on him.

PHILIP
If you don’t go up to him, he won’t
know you're here.

Norman is hesitant.

PHILIP (CONT’ D)
Look at him. He is sealed off, very
few people have access to him’ now
that he is King. For all you_ know
he may never return your calls, or
worse - he may never even receive
your messages.

NORMAN
Nonsense. Micha is a friend.

PHILIP
Micha? There is no more Micha.
There is prime minister Eshel, and
he has millions of friends. You
need to get on that line.

Norman knows Philip is right.

INT. HALL IN CONVENTION CENTER - LATER 46

With AT LEAST TWENTY PEOPLE ahead of them, Norman and Philip
are standing on line to meet Eshel.

From Norman’s POV we hear bits and pieces of the conversation
around Eshel and see visual fragments of these very quick and
awkward encounters.

We jump cut from one encounter to the next, emphasizing the
repetitiveness.

One of the people introduced is--

DUBY

Jo Wilf, needs no introduction.
ESHEL

Mr. Wilf! It is good to finally

meet you.

(CONTINUED)
46

36.
CONTINUED: 46

Jo Wilf (70), the ocean-liner, receives a warm hand shake
from Eshel but then he is ushered away just like the rest.

Norman follows him as he is pushed out of the inner circle,
noticing how protective Duby is of Eshel’s space.

As Norman and Philip move up in line, we also get a sense for
how this works: Hanna spots the person next in line, together
with another AIDE she verifies their identity, then she
whispers the info into Duby’s ear.

Hanna is the friendly one. Duby is protective and suspicious.

We close in on Norman. He is only 4 or 5 people away from
meeting Eshel and he is suddenly very nervous about what
might happen.

DUBY (0.S.)
Pastor Kermit Little, founder of
Christians Assembly for Israel.

ESHEL (0.S.)
Pastor. I’m honored you are here.
We'll be seeing each other tomorrow
night, right?

Norman catches Hanna’s glance.

She smiles at him but it doesn’t seem like she has any idea
who he is.

She looks down at her lists. Turns a few pages. Nothing.

Duby’s suspicious, intimidating eyes also fall on Norman for
a brief second.

Norman fixes his NAME TAG so that it is in clear view.

Philip looks over at Norman. Norman is doing his best to
project ease. But Philip senses his distress.

| PHILIP
Everything okay?

NORMAN
Yes. Fine. I might be reacting to
something in the room. But I’m
okay...

The aide standing next to Hanna is going through her lists as
well, finally finding what she was looking for.

Norman sees her whisper something into Hanna’s ear, who
whispers something into Duby’s ear, who looks up directly at
Norman.

On the sound-track - background ambiance disappears.

Norman is as helpless and pale as a condemned man about to
hear his verdict. Then he hears--

DUBY
Norman Oppenheimer, from New
York...

Eshel turns to face Norman.
A beat.

There is definite favorable recognition. Eshel’s face breaks
into a huge and warm smile.

Sound-track back to normal.

ESHEL
Norman!! My friend! Where have you
been? I’ve been trying to reach
you.

Norman finally can breathe again, allowing Eshel to pull him
in for a warm and meaningful embrace.

Secret service agents, aides, photographers, all seem to
close in on Norman, but not in a threatening way - they are
all smiling at him.

Including Jo Wilf, who is watching Norman with a curious look
on his face.

All but Duby - who is not smiling and still seems very
suspicious of Norman.

ESHEL (CONT'D)
(to Duby and Hanna
You know Norman, right?

They all shake hands.

ESHEL (CONT'D)

Naomi. Come meet Norman
Oppenheimer. Norman, this is my
wife Naomi.

They shake hands.

ESHEL (CONT'D)

Norman is going to be my special
honorary ambassador to New York
Jewry. My personal, special

advisor.

DUBY
He is?

NORMAN
I am?

ESHEL

Yes. Of course. Look around you.
Look around...

We look around - THE ROOM HAS ENERGY. HUNDREDS OF FACES, NAME-
TAGS, BUSINESS CARDS CHANGING HANDS, MEN AND WOMEN IN
VIBRANT, LOUD, PRESSING SOCIAL ENCOUNTERS.

ESHEL (CONT’D
There are over five hundred
organizations represented in this
room. It is a tremendous force of
nature. Tremendous. Unprecedented
in our history. We need to
understand how this incredible
force unites around the issues that
are important for the Jewish
people... and the world!

Duby can relax. Another empty, meaningless promise.
But it is enough to impress Philip. And confuse Norman.

EDASH! Their picture is taken against the backdrop of the two
ags.

The next people in line are ushered up to Eshel, and Norman
is prepared to move aside, but Eshel won’t let go of Norman’s
arm.

DUBY
Congressman Bob Love from Georgia.

ESHEL
Tom, good to see you. Do you know
Norman Oppenheimer?

BOB LOVE
No, I don’t. Nice to meet you,
Norman. This is my wife, Joyce.

Norman finally shakes off his initial daze.

NORMAN
Nice to meet you, Congressman. Mrs.
Love.

Philip leans in, reminding Norman of his presence.

NORMAN (CONT’D)

This is my nephew, Philip Cohen, I
think he is the youngest partner at
Frankle, Zell, Gould and Rudoff in
New York. Right?

PHILIP
Very nice to meet you. One of the
youngest...

Toby is married to a Solomon. Beth.
She is Charlie Solomon's

ESHEL
(to Bob Love)
This Toby, you heard of Smile Bars?
The candy bars. Amazing story...

AS THIS CONVERSATION CONTINUES-- Our camera gradually moves
up and away from the commotion around Eshel. Norman is in the
center of it, shaking hands, laughing, talking, accepting
business cards.

From a high angle, it all appears like a busy BEEHIVE.
Hundreds of people, buzzing around the room, maneuvering
toward the center.

The camera stops high above the room with this intricate,
dynamic, human pattern filling our entire frame, illustrating
the elaborate network that is being formed in front of our
eyes... --FREEZE!

WITHIN THE FREEZE:

On Norman: looking around him - he sees a forest of human
encounters frozen in time.

Just as great composers create perfect harmonies in their
mind, as world-class chess players can plan 50 moves ahead -
so Norman's genius comes into play in this room, at this
moment. He sees how it all connects!

Norman examines the different frozen interactions.

--He sees Arthur (nuclear submarine) Taub. He examines his
cocky face without_any spite or resentment, only a satisfied
smile that says - I have arrived!

He also sees Arthur’s (still smiling) assistant.

Norman takes it_all in. He is drunk, but not from alcohol.
He has never felt this safe, or at home, in his life.

The last image in this series of FLASHES from Norman’s POV,
is a shot of Eshel being escorted out of the room by a dense

herd of aides and security.

Eshel turns his head and gives Norman one last look.

There is longing in Norman’s eyes as he watches Eshel

disappear.

INT. TRAIN - NIGHT 51

ALEXANDRA (ALEX) GREEN (30s) is entering the train car still
at the platform of Union Station. She takes off her coat as
she finds a seat by the aisle.

There is an AIPAC NAME TAG still hanging around her neck
under her coat.

Once she sits down, we notice Norman entering the car . He
sees her name tag and smiles at her, sitting across the aisle
from her.

NORMAN
Norman Oppenheimer. Nice to meet
you.
(reading off her name tag)
Alex Green.

ALEX
Nice to meet you too. I guess we
can take these off now.

They both remove their name tags. Alex pulls out her iPad,
but before she can turn it on--

NORMAN
What brings you to AIPAL?

ALEX
I represent one of the
organizations.

NORMAN
Which one? Which organization?

ALEX
I work in the Israeli consulate in
New York.

NORMAN
Really? You're Israeli? You don’t
sound Israeli.

ALEX
I’m not.

NORMAN (CONT'D)
No? Very famous family, a big
supporter of the Israel museum.
His wife Sophia... No?

Alex shakes her head. Norman senses her coldness, so he lets
go.

As passengers continue to enter the train, walking through
the isle between them--

NORMAN (CONT’D)
Wait... Green... Any connection to
Julian Green? From Basel...

Alex shakes her head again.

The last PASSENGER has entered the car. He stops ri ht
between them and indicates to Alex that he would e the
seat next to her.

Alex gets up to allow him to get in.

NORMAN (CONT'D)
(moving over in his seat)
You are welcome to sit here... If
you're busy, I won’t bother you.
Don’t worry...

Alex looks up at the seat situation in the car. The last
travelers are finding their seats, filling up most of the
car. She doesn’t really have a civil way to refuse, so she
collects her stuff and sits next to Norman.

ALEX
Thank you.

As she turns on her iPad--

NORMAN
What do you do in the consulate?
ALEX
I’m in the legal department. I’ma

Eshel, Duby, Hanna, Naomi and other AIDES AND STAFF together
with the regular GROUP OF SECRET SERVICE MEN, enter one of
the large drawing rooms, still swarming with JOURNALISTS,
EMBASSY STAFF AND OTHER GUESTS.

The official/ceremonial part of the day is over and Eshel is
in a playful, jet-lagged mood.

ESHEL
Everybody! Go home. Go to sleep!
Leave me alone! The historical bond
between the United States and
Israel has never been stronger, you
can all relax. At least tilt
tomorrow morning. Right Duby?

DUBY
{smiling
The “specia relationship” is
intact!
ESHEL

That's right. The “special,
relationship”. And...

Eshel lifts his hand as if he is conducting a choir.

ESHEL, DUBY AND EVERYBODY ELSE
The “unwavering ‘commitment to
Israel's security...”

ESHEL
Yafe. The unwavering commitment.
Now, please, leave me alone... Get

more hand tonight, my fingers will

Eshel allows himself to fall into one of the sofas in the
room. He loosens his tie and kicks off his SHOES.

With Hanna’s encouragement, most of the people exit the room.

But there is one tall, slim MAN in his 60s waiting patiently
in the corner of the room who is not leaving. His name is
BRUCE SCHWARTZ.

DUBY
(to Eshel)
One more hand to shake, I’m afraid.
You've met Bruce Schwartz before,
haven't you? Special Middle East
Coordinator

Bruce comes over and sits in one of the chairs opposite
Eshel.

BRUCE
Just over the phone. Good to
finally meet in person, rime
minister. We don’t have to shake
hands...

ESHEL
That is very considerate of you.

They shake hands anyway.
ESHEL (CONT'D)

You're not going to make me put on
my shoes, are you?

BRUCE
No. This is as informal as could
be.

ESHEL

Good. The formal me needs a rest...

DUBY
Bruce would like to go over some
points before tomorrow’s meeting
with the president.

Bruce leans in. Duby and Hanna lean in too, to Bruce’s
surprise.

BRUCE

It is less about your meeting with
the president and more about the
statements you will deliver
elsewhere in town. As somebody who
occupies a fairly tough job
himself the president is always

ympathetic to foreign leaders
dea ing with complicated internal
politics...

ESHEL
Let me stop you. Excuse me. Ani lo

Duby, on instinct, is about to interfere, but Eshel signals
him to remain out of it.

ESHEL (CONT'D)
Please tell the president that I am
here to say ‘yes’ to peace. I’m
sorry - “state of peace” as we
agreed to call it. I fully accept
his vision. I understand it and I
believe in it. No internal politics
will change my commitment to the
Wye document.

Duby, Hanna and Bruce are all surprised by how firm Eshel
sounds. Surprised and relieved.

Eshel gets up to grab a handful of CHOCOLATE COVERED NUTS out
of a bowl on one of the tables --

ESHEL (CONT'D)
This evening I had to... Duby, how
do you say mas sefataim?

DUBY
To pay lip service.

ESHEL
I had to pay lip service to a few
organizations on a few minor
issues, but I promise you it has no
substance.

BRUCE | ;
I’m sure the president will...

ESHEL

(cutting Bruce off,

sitting across from him)
You know what I’ve found out in the
last couple of weeks since I was
elected? It is very strange,
because it is the opposite of what
I thought I would feel. Maybe the
president can identify with me...
For the first time in my
professional life, I have no
political worries. This is true. I
don’t care if I’m reelected.
Somehow God put me in this job. It
is not that I didn’t work very hard
to get here, I did, but hundreds of
other potential leaders worked and
campaigned just as hard as I did,
and for some reason I’m the one
sitting in this chair today. The
top spot. I’ve reached the top of
the ladder.

Eshel picks up a SMALL FLAG that was placed on the table,
gets up for more chocolate.

ESHEL (CONT'D)

Why me? And not someone else? Who
knows. Believe me, I’m as surprised
as everyone else. But this is the
interesting thing - instead of
feeling the burden of that great
responsibility, I’m feeling...
Duby, iech omrim goral?

DUBY
Fate.
ESHEL
I feel... Fate, which weighs

nothing at all. If God put me here,
he must have had a good reason. I’m
not free to run away from this job,
but to be honest - no single human
being can really claim to be big
enough for this job either.

Hanna and Duby exchange a glance.

DUBY
(to Bruce)
I would be nappy to go over our
itinerary with you so that we can
discuss the sensitivities of each
group...

ESHEL
(to Bruce, cutting Duby)
What is it that really worries the
president? Tell me. I want to know.
What doesn’t he want me to say?

BRUCE
Well, you have been saying
different things in different
forums. I think we are trying to
get a better understanding of the
singular message you wish to
deliver.

ESHEL

You were there tonight, right?
Hanna » how many completely opposing

organization 1 leaders came up to me

said - we're behind yous You

have our support to stan our
ground. How many? 50? 100? Yeach
with a completely different agenda.
There is no such thing as a

sorry if...
ESHEL

(cutting Bruce)
I‘1l tell you what my singular
message is. I’m going to end this
conflict. How? I’m going to say
‘yes’ to compromise, to EVERYBODY!
Because the opposite of compromise
is not idealism. The opposite of
compromise is not integrity. The
opposite of compromise is
fanaticism and death. LIFE is
compromise. I not only believe in
that. That is who I am. That is why
I'm here, in this position, If it
works, I will go down in history as
the leader who ended this epic
conflict. If I’m wrong, and BY
compromise leads to another bloody
war - I will blame God for giving
me a role I was incapable o:
performing.

Eshel’s confused monologue, (only a notch below Dr.
Strangelove level) is a result of extreme fatigue and the
high level of adrenaline his body has been releasing all
night. But now he is done. Eshel pops the last chocolate
covered nut into his mouth, picks up his SHOES and walks

Bruce, Duby and Hanna have gone from pleasant surprise in the
beginning of his monologue, to complete shock at the end.

INT. TRAIN  - NIGHT 53

have been dimmed.

NORMAN
So can I ask you, what kind of
stuff do you deal with?

ALEX
(covering her iPad)
There is what’s called a mutual
legal assistance treaty between
Israel and the United States. We
have our hands full...

Russian oligarchs who are wanted

Alex shakes her head. Her lips are sealed.

ALEX
Sorry.

NORMAN

these international treaties. She’s

Carol?

ALEX
Not personally, no, but I know who
she is...

NORMAN
I'd be happy to introduce you...

ALEX
That’s not necessary. I wouldn’t
want to bother her. But thank you.

She is a solid brick wall, leaving Norman no entrance point.

Alex looks at her watch. Then at Norman, who has no reading
material, and doesn’t seem like he plans on sleeping.

She pulls out a pair of EARPHONES from her bag. As she
inserts one into her ear - Norman catches a quick glimpse at

apologize if it came out that way.

NORMAN ;
Then what are you saying? I don’t
understand.

ALEX
Never mind. I appreciate you trying
to help connect me, it is just that
I don’t need connections right now.

NORMAN
So what do you need?

ALEX
What do I need??

NORMAN
Yeah. I’m sitting next to you on
the train, we were both at the
convention together, how can I help
you? I'm offering my assistance.
I’m a good person to know. Take
advantage of that. What do you
need? I’1l help you get it.

Alex sincerely thinks this over for a moment, but comes up

with --

ALEX
I don’t need anything.

NORMAN
Impossible. Everybody needs
something. Even tough lesbian
lawyers.

ALEX
I need many things, but not
necessarily things you can help

NORMAN
Try me.

ALEX

I need the satisfaction of knowing
that I'm doing good in the world.

NORMAN
(scratching his ear)
That’s a big one.

They both smile.

NORMAN (CONT'D)
Your parents - they’re proud of
you?

ALEX
I think so. I hope so...

NORMAN
They should be.

Alex sees that Norman means it and accepts his complement.

ALEX
What about you? Family? Kids?

NORMAN
A daughter just finished graduate
school. Her mother died when she
was three.

ALEX
Sorry to hear that. You raised your
daughter alone?

NORMAN
I did my best, yes.

ALEX
That must have been difficult.

NORMAN
You_know what_they say - small
children, small problems...

ALEX
And why were you at the convention?
I noticed you were speaking with
the prime minister. You know him
well?

Norman hesitates for a brief moment before he responds. Then--

NORMAN
Yes. I do. Micah is a close friend.

ALEX
How did you meet him?

NORMAN
I bought him a pair of shoes.

ALEX
You bought him a pair of shoes?

NORMAN
(in a sweet folkie melody)
You never know... You never know...

  

You never know.

Miraculously, Alex is now completely captivated by Norman.

ALEX
What do you mean you bought him a
pair of shoes?

NORMAN
You never know. A pair of shoes.
The most expensive shoes in all of
New York, but the best investment I
made in my life.

Norman pauses. From here on the scene is shot in extreme
close-ups, accentuating every tiny, careful, move they make,
like bomb disposal experts picking a path through a

minefield.
ALEX
May I ask what you do for a living?
NORMAN
I’m a businessman.
ALEX
What sort of business?
NORMAN
Consulting. Mostly.
ALEX
You work in a consulting firm?
NORMAN
Firm? No. It is basically only me
these days.
ALEX

Who do you consult?

NORMAN
Businesses. Organizations.
Individuals. It varies. Sometimes I
consult other consultants.

Norman smiles. So does Alex.

ALEX
Do you have a specific area of
expertise? Can you explain to me
how your business works? If it is
not too complicated... I’m curious.

Norman examines her face. Maybe there is something she
“needs” after all.

EXT. TRAIN - NIGHT 54

A wide shot of our train zooming by in the night, en route to
Manhattan.

OVER VARIOUS IMAGES OF THE TRAIN IN MOVEMENT: Norman’s and
Alex's faces are SUPERIMPOSED.

SUPERIMPOSED MONTAGE. TRAIN - NIGHT 55

 

We don’t hear their dialogue, but we SEE a heightened version
of their conversation.

--Norman is explaining something to Alex. At first subtly,
with a modesty in his facial expressions, then with more and
more enthusiasm.

--Alex is nodding her head, smiling, raising her eyebrows
with surprise.

--Norman drawing a diagram on a piece of paper with NAMES and
NUMBERS and ARROWS connecting the different names, as he did
in the first scene with Philip. For this part, Alex has put
on her READING GLASSES.

EXT. TRAIN - PENN STATION - NIGHT 56

The superimposed faces fade out, dgaving us with an image of
the train entering the final tunnel leading into Penn
Station, stopping only an inch from the BUFFER STOP at the
end of the track.

INT./EXT. PENN STATION - NIGHT 57

Norman and Alex exit the train onto the platform. We sense
the three hour ride has created a bond between them.

Norman takes a BUSINESS CARD out of his wallet and hands it
to Alex. It is his last.

NORMAN
I know you don’t need anything, and
I’m not offering anything, I
definitely won’t introduce you to
anyone. But, take this card,
please... take it. You never know.
You never know...

Alex accepts Norman’s business card.
ALEX
(looking at the card)
Thank you, Norman. Our ride
together was very interesting.

NORMAN
That’s it?? Come here.

He pulls her in for a HUG. It makes Alex laugh. She doesn’t
reciprocate, but she doesn’t resist him either.

NORMAN (CONT'D)
Take care, Alex. Good luck.

She smiles and takes off toward one of the escalators.

As she disappears up the escalator, she waves his business
card, indicating that she will be in touch.

Norman, alone on the platform, waves back to her, satisfied.
CUT TO ALEX'S FACE: Once out of Norman’s sight, her smile

disappears. She places Norman’s card in her purse and takes a
deep, troubled breath.

INT. PENN STATION, DUNKIN DONUTS - NIGHT 58

 

Alex is sitting by a table alone in the only shop that is
open at this hour. She is looking at her YELLOW LEGAL PAD on
which Norman scribbled the messy diagram with names and
arrows, specifying next to each name what he or she “NEEDS”
or “CAN GIVE”.

Alex is copying down the names to a new sheet of paper.

Then she looks up. From her POV we see:

INT. PENN STATION - NIGHT - SAME TIME 59

 

On the other side of the station, entering the closed-off
waiting area, Norman is wandering through the empty seats,
finally sitting down. He takes off his shoes. He pulls out of
his pocket a box of MIKE AND IKES, chewing on them 3 at a
time.

Alex is watching him from a distance. She picks up his
business card and decides to dial his number.

We see Norman look at his phone and answer the call.

NORMAN
Hello...

ALEX
Hi. It’s Alex. From the train...
Just now.

NORMAN

Alex! I’m so glad you called. I’m
just getting into a cab. Should I
pick you up? Where are you?

ALEX
I’m still at Penn Station.

We see Norman look around, wondering if he is caught. He
can’t see Alex through the glass barriers and across the
hall, but Alex is not hiding from him. It feels as if she
actually wants him to see her.

NORMAN
On the street?

ALEX
No. I’m still inside.

Norman is silent for a second.

ALEX (CONT'D)
Is everything okay, Norman?

NORMAN
Yes, of course. Everything is
perfect. Couldn’t be better. This
whole evening... it’s like I’m
floating on a cloud. What about you
- are you okay? Why did you call?

Alex looks down at the diagram on her pad. Then--
ALEX
I realized just now that I didn’t
give you my number and I wanted you
to have it. You never know...
FADE TO BLACK.

TITLE: FOUR MONTHS LATER

INT. STAIRWELL 60

We are looking down from the third floor of a creaky
stairwell in Rabbi Blumenthal’s synagogue. WE HEAR HEAVY
FOOTSTEPS CLIMBING UP THE STEPS. A PHONE RINGS.

He doesn’t look like everything is perfect. He is fatigued
from the walk-up, carrying his coat, scarf, gloves, hat,
umbrella and PHONE in his hands.

Norman looks at his phone for a moment, deliberating whether
or not to make a call. Finally, he decides to press CALL.

INT. HANNA’S OFFICE - EVENING - ISRAEL 62

 

Hanna is by her desk in the prime minister’s office in
Jerusalem. Her phone is RINGING, but she is letting it ring.

There is a TREMENDOUS BOUQUET OF ROSES on her desk.

Hanna looks tired and upset, holding her head, looking down
at_a CARD. We close in on the card. It reads: I’M SO SORRY.
PLEASE, PLEASE FORGIVE ME. NORMAN OPPENHEIMER.

INT. STAIRWELL, THIRD FLOOR - AT THE SAME TIME 63

 

With dilated nostrils, Norman inhales and exhales twice
before he gives up and hangs up.

Norman closes his eyes, as if to restart his mood.

When he opens his eyes, he has resolved himself for whatever
lies ahead. He exits the frame.

INT. BANQUET HALL - DAY 64

This is a medium size hall on the third floor of the
synagogue.

A group of 9 MEN and 3 WOMEN are convened around a table in
the center of this elegant but outdated room, conducting what
we will soon find out is a Synagogue board meeting. Norman
appears at the entrance to this hall.

RABBI BLUMENTHAL
Look who showed up... Our savior
has finally arrived.

NORMAN
Sorry I’m late.

Norman walks in and sees that the table is scattered with
little paper plates with different NUTS- almonds, walnuts,
pistachios and peanuts.

NORMAN (CONT’D)
(moving a plate of nuts)

But that’s no reason to kill me.

Can you get rid of the nuts please?
65

INT. BANQUET HALL - CONTINUOUS 65

The nuts are gone.

While we focus on Norman’s face, his breathing, his eyes
moving around the room as he sits by this table, we hear
Rabbi Blumenthal -

RABBI BLUMENTHAL
The situation is very simple. The
National Council has decided to
sell the building. They are
willing to try their best to keep
our lease as part of whatever
agreement they sign with the new
owners, but as we all understand,
they can’t guarantee anything. TO
be practica we need to raise
ap) roximately fourteen million
dollars, to save us from the
wrecking ball and insure our future
ere...

We see Rabbi Blumenthal’s lips move, but we no longer hear
him.

Instead we focus on Norman's agitated face.
This takes us into the following FRENETIC, FAST MOVING

sequence recapping the events that lead tO this board
meeting.

INT. JO WILF’S OFFICE - SHARED WITH - INT. STAPLES STORE - 66
DAY

On one side of the frame we see JO WILF, in his GRAND MIDTOWN
OFFICE.

On the other side of the frame we see NORMAN in a STAPLES
STORE, speaking on his cell phone.

JO WILF
Norman, Philip tells me you can
help me.

NORMAN
You will have my best effort, yes.

JO WILF
Here, talk to Bill.

Jo puts the call on SPEAKER - Bill Kavish steps up to the
phone.

BILL
Norman, this is Bill. Norman?

NORMAN
Is Jo still there? Can he hear me?

We see Jo signal to Bill to say no.

BILL
Jo had to_ step out.
Let me tell you what we need. You

NORMAN
(disappointed he has to
deal with Bill)
I’m all yours. Go ahead...

BILL
We have a colleague who could use a
friendly introduction at the State
Department...

NORMAN
The state department?

BILL
Yes. You do that for us, open the
door for him at the state
department, get him in a room with
Douglas Gordon - that thing Philip
discussed with Jo - we’ll see what
we can do.

Jo Wilf looks over at the GROUP OF PEOPLE in his office with
an expression that says - “it’s worth a try”.

Norman passes a PEN TESTING PAD. He writes down- DOUGLAS
GORDON, and takes the page with him.

Then - Jo Wilf’s side of the frame is replaced with the
interior of a BULLET PROOF LIMOUSINE in Israel.

INT/EXT - LIMO IN ISRAEL - SHARED WITH - INT. STAPLES STORBE7

Hanna and Duby are in the back seat of a limo that is part of
Eshel’s motorcade passing through the streets of Jerusalem.

Norman is still in the Staples store, looking over a variety
of ENVELOPES on display.

NORMAN
Hanna, please, Just give me a
minute with him on the phone. One
minute. Less than a minute. This is
something he wants to hear...

Hanna looks at Duby who is shaking his head decisively -
Absolutely not.

HANNA
I'm really sorry, Norman. The prime
minister is not available to speak
right now.

NORMAN
Then can I speak with Duby? Put
Duby on the phone?
(whisperin
It has to do with a special request
the prime minister asked me to look
in to.

Hanna looks at Duby - Duby is shaking his head - no!

HANNA
I'm afraid Duby is also
unavailable. I’m sorry Norman.
These are busy days for us.
Unfortunately I can’t be more
specific, but I’m sure you
understand.

Norman is visibly distressed by this. By now he has walked
over to the OFFICE FURNITURE SECTION. He sits down on one of
the office chairs behind one of the desks on display, as if
this were his natural work area.

NORMAN
I understand. Of course. Alright.
Please let the prime minister know
that I have an answer for him and
if he has a free moment, at any
hour, day or night, it would be
great if we can have a very, very
short phone conversation about a
certain individual on the board of
the dean's advisers at Harvard
business school.

HANNA
(checking with Duby...)
I will, Norman. Thanks for calling.

Duby is signaling with his hand to ask who the “certain
individual” is.

HANNA (CONT'D)
Can you tell me who this person is?

NORMAN
-- I’11 tell the prime minister
ali about him when we speak.

Duby smiles, shaking his head. He knows how Norman functions.

HANNA
Okay, Norman. Thank you...

NORMAN
No — thank you, Hanna! Go back to
doing your important work. I’m
sorry for interrupting... You’re
doing a great job and I know the
prime minister appreciates it...
Just don’t forget me Hanna, okay?

HANNA
(to Duby, in Hebrew)
What do I do with him? That’s the
fifth time I’ve blown him off.

DUBY
Don’t say it as if you’ ve done
something wrong. That’s your job.
Keeping the Normans away.

HANNA
Do you know what the prime minister
wanted from him? Isn’t David
applying to Harvard?

DUBY
I don’t care.
Norman does not get passed you. No
matter what he says.
If he becomes obsessive, you can
take a call from him once every few
days so that he doesn't get
paranoid, and to keep the
connection alive, but never, never
put him through. Understood? Never.

Hanna accepts this, but she doesn’t like it.

DUBY (CONT'D)
Don’t worry about Norman. Gettin
you on the phone is enough for him.
More than enough. In his head, he
just had a conversion with the
prime minister of Israel.

INT. STAPLES STORE - DAY 69

Norman is by the cashier, paying for a package of ENVELOPES
and a CARTRIDGE OF BLACK PRINTER INK. He is paying with a few
crumpled single dollar bills and a handful of quarters, dimes
and nickels. Right before he checks out, he places a box of
MIKE AND IKES on the counter as well.

EXT. MANHATTAN STREET - SHARED WITH - INT. RABBI BLUMENTHAL

RABBI BLUMENTHAL
Why don’t you answer your phone?
I’ve been calling all morning.

NORMAN
I'm answering now. Do you want to
hear what I have to say?

RABBI BLUMENTHAL
You spoke to him?? What did he say?

NORMAN
I don’t have a final answer yet,
but it looks good. I’1l be at the
board meeting with all the details
but let’s just say - get ready for
a surprise.

RABBI BLUMENTHAL
What kind of surprise are we
talking about? How many zeros does
this surprise have? Can you tell me
that at least?

NORMAN
(hailing a taxi)
If I tell you, where’s the
surprise? It’s a considerable
surprise. Believe me. I gotta go,
Rabbi. I’1l see you tomorrow...

Blumenthal’s study apparently also serves as a CLEANING
SUPPLIES storage place. The Rabbi picks up a WINDOW CLEANING
SPRAY because he needs to wrap his fist round something.

RABBI. BLUMENTHAL
Norman, you realize how important
this is, right? They are going to
kick us out of here... You need to
give us a firm answer. No games...
Norman!?-- Norman! !

Norman has hung up.

Rabbi Blumenthal faces the sweet couple waiting for him,
doing his best to erase the anxiety on his face.

He is then replaced with Jo Wilf and his team in Wilf’s
office. And Norman is now sitting in a bus-stop.

INT./EXT. BUS-STOP - SHARED WITH - INT. WILF’S OFFICE - DAY/1

Norman has the box of MIKE AND IKEs on the bench next to him.

colleague's name?

Jo Wilf shakes his head toward Bill Kavish.

BILL
No e-mails, Norman.
His name is Matthias Kone, he is an
official in the treasury department
in_the Ivory Coast. Eshel’s office
will need to reach out to him.
We're not involved. It has to come
from them. Maybe he can join their
delegation in Davos...

On Norman's face: The Ivory Coast - that doesn’t sound good
to him.

Jo Wilf’s office is replaced with Hanna and Duby now part of
the prime minister’s entourage at an HONORARY DOCTORATE
CEREMONY in an unidentified University.

INT. UNIVERSITY AUDITORIUM - NIGHT - ISRAEL 72

We enter during a musical interlude. A VERDI ARIA is being
performed on stage.

On Hanna, off stage, surrounded by security guards: her cell
phone is blinking. Her screen reads - “Norman”. She shows it

be firm.

It is beautiful and colorful and glamorous, buzzing with
assertive women shopping for shoes.

Norman finds a relatively quiet spot.

Philip and Norman, each in their separate surroundings, are

anything though...

NORMAN

PHILIP
Don’t belittle what I’m doing. In
the world of Harvard admissions,
this is the biggest no no in the
book. It’s like incest. It’s taboo.

Morning. Not evening.

They both hang up.

Norman dials Hanna again.

INT. HANNA’S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING - ISRAEL 82

Hanna has just_woken up (she is seven hours ahead). She takes
the phone and locks herself in her bathroom, pushing her
THREE YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER out the door - Once alone, she
composes herself and answers:

HANNA
Good morning, Norman.

NORMAN

Did you sleep okay? Family sleep

Norman deliberates for a brief moment, then, impulsively,

He holds his breath while he waits.

INT. MICHA ESHEL’S CLOSET - NIGHT - ISRAEL - SAME TIME 84

We are in a walk-in closet in Micha Eshel’s private
residence.

In a BOX with other unused items from before he was elected,
we see an outdated cellphone vibrate and come to life.

We see the screen: “NORMAN”

Our view moves back to reveal Naomi, Eshel’s wife, sleeping
alone in her bed.

INT. BERGDORF GOODMAN - DUSK 85

Norman, looking out one of the windows gverjooking Central
Park at dusk, is holding his phone carelessly in his hand as
it continues buzzing in Eshel’s closet.

We close in on Norman’s face. He is exhausted, consumed by
frustration. It leads us back to--

There is a collective sigh and groan around the table.

RABBI BLUMENTHAL (CONT'D)
Yeah. But... let’s not despair -
this is where our friend Norman
Oppenheimer comes in. Norman...

All eyes shift to Norman.

Norman looks up, takes a sip from his plastic cup of orange

Our view moves down Norman’s body, following his arm to his
hands to his fingers, SCRATCHING his SWOLLEN AND INFLAMED
CALF. It is an obsessive scratch that leaves BLOOD STAINS on
Norman's fingernails when we see him bring his hand back up
to the table..

Seven million is real. When you get

INT. MAIN SANCTUARY - LATER 87

Norman is sitting alone on one of the benches, He has his
swollen leg up, resting on the seat next to him.

He is looking at the MEMORIAL PLAQUE - hundreds of names
engraved in bronze sheets on the wall.

Cutting to a new angle, we realize we are seeing Norman from
the POV of Rabbi Blumenthal who is standing by the door.

Feeling his presence, Norman puts his leg down. They exchange
a smile.

RABBI BLUMENTHAL

It’s worth saving... Whoever your
guy is, he is doing a great thing.
Thank you.

Norman accepts the acknowledgment with a nod. Just as R.
Blumenthal is about to leave --

RABBI BLUMENTHAL (CONT'D)
You sure you can’t tell me who it
is? I probably should know. I'd
like to thank him... Just between
you and me. Is it Arthur Taub?

NORMAN
He was very clear about staying
anonymous.

RABBI BLUMENTHAL
Maybe just... Can you tell me why
he is doing this?

Norman thinks about this for a moment.

NORMAN
He can afford it. He knows me. I
told him about the community and
the history of the building, and he
said sure, why not. It is money he
gives away anyway... If not to us,
then to some other charity.

The rabbi accepts that answer, although we sense there is a
trace of skepticism still there.

RABBI BLUMENTHAL

And why does he insist on remaining
anonymous?

There is a fraction of a second before Norman responds that
indicates he might _ not have a good answer. But then he is
back on the bal

Because ify copie find out he did
this kind o thing, there will be
hundreds of other requests. It is
not his usual type of charity. He
is doing this as a favor to me. And
I promised him I won't reveal his
name.

The rabbi is nodding his head, examining Norman’s face.

RABBI BLUMENTHAL
Well. It is a good thing. That’s
all I can say. Please thank him, on
behalf of all of us.
Not that raising the other half is
going to be easy... But the
challenge - It’s good. It’s good.
We should all open up our hearts...

If there is any way you think it
would be appropriate to honer this
mysterious : man, or woman, some kind

dedication... Or if there is
something you would like me to

Norman has been waiting for this opening from the beginning
of the scene.

NORMAN
Now that you mention it, the person
who introduced me to Mr! Anonymous
is my nephew, a very successful
young lawyer, maybe I mentioned him
to you - Philip Cohen. He just got
engaged to a very sweet girl...

R. Blumenthal places his hat on his head, takes a moment to
himself, then he exits the building.

Once alone in the Sanctuary, after he hears the main doors
shut, Norman lifts his swollen leg back up.

e pulls at the cuff of his pants enough to reveal the
BLEEDING HIVES on his calf and around the swollen ankle -
But Norman doesn't want to look at it so he immediately
covers it back up.

He takes out his phone We see his screen: He goes to
CONTACTS. He scrolls through the names on his screen -
hundreds of names zoom by.

They mesh with: The MEMORIAL PLAQUES on the wall - the names
fill the frame - Zoltans and Sigmunds and Isadoras and
Miklos, Weinbergers, Mandelbaums, Rolats and Lefkowitzs -
dissolving into each other, creating a blurry collage of
contacts on Norman’s phone and the dead sounding Jewish names
on the wall.

We hear Norman on the phone:

what we are talking about. A
Russian gas Teerany is jeopardizing
our peace talks and getting between
us and the Turks because
reconciliation in this area is a
threat to their monopoly in Europe.

Duby nods his head. Eshel doesn’t like this...

DUBY
Even if it seems dirty to you, it
is important and necessary,. The
Americans are backing our talks for
the exact same reason - to break
the Russian monopoly in the
European gas market. No difference.
For us it is just a question of
keeping the right balance between
all these interests.

ESHEL
So now we are calling it ‘balance’?

DUBY

like compromise...

Dub opens the door and with a slight touch on Eshel’s lower

We hear cameras clicking from the other side of the door.

Eshel has a frozen smile on his face as a DELEGATION OF

they are.

He pauses, as if to check within himself for any
contaminating intentions.

ESHEL (CONT'D)

A decent, moral, good human being
can’t function in*these circles of
power, money, national pride. It’s
impossible.

He enters his walk-in closet and is drawn to look in the box
containing his old, private CELL PHONE.

Eshel smiles.

Why is it four hundred shekel? I

From his POV, we see his screen as he scrolls passed the

missed calls from Norman.

ESHEL

Norman Oppenheimer was looking for

me. I should call him. He has

always helped that lump in my chest

disappear.

NAOMI
And I never understood why -
If anything, he should make that
lump feel worse.

ESHEL
Why do you say that? He’s a good
friend. I’ve never met anyone as

Okay, without saying anything
negative about Norman Oppenheimer,

ESHEL
I doubt he feels that way.
That's actually pretty insulting.

NAOMI
No it’s not. It’s just the reality.
When you needed him in New York you
allowed him to enter you life, now
that you don’t need him anymore,
you completely ignore him. But I’m
not complaining about that because
I think he’s an embarrassing human
being and he shouldn’t have been in
your life in the first place.

ESHEL
But you went along with it... We
took the favor.

From Norman’s POV, we see the SHTETL MAN pacing the sidewalk

Philip enters a room full of people waiting for him.

CAROL
You have the president of the

to obtain evidence in a criminal
case... ecially if it has to do
with a lester of a foreign country!
How could I not know this
investigation was going on??

ALEX
Because it’s not going on. Yet. It
is a newspaper headline, not an
investigation.

CAROL
So where are they getting this
from? Is the Israeli police
questioning an American citizen or
not?

ALEX
As far as I understand, they’re
still figuring out if they have
enough information to make a proper
request. The witness doesn’t even
know he is a witness at this point.

Don’t give me that look. Norman
Oppenheimer is not a friend of

less. But trust me- Norman
Oppenheimer might be a royal nudge,
but he is not your villain. He’s a
poor, jonely shmo trying to
survive. And he is a pathological
liar, in case you didn’t notice.

ALEX
I don't think he is a villain
either, but over the past three
years he has been unusually
generous toward the prime minister
of Israel and has created an
intricate network of people who

Alex looks at Carol for guidance. She seems just as clueless.

NORMAN (CONT’D
Forget it. Forget it. I didn't ask.
I respect your professionalism. But
gest tell me one thing... You’re
he one dealing with this
investigation, right? This is your
department, isn’t it?

ALEX
Norman...

Carol is signaling with her hand to Alex to let Norman go on.

NORMAN ALEX (CONT'D)
Yes... I’m sorry. Please continue...

NORMAN
I'll tell you why I’m calling. I
hope it’s okay. I know this is
delicate but I feel it is my duty.
I think I can help you out.

A pause for quizzical looks between Alex and Carol.

Norman, who is hyper, inadvertently knocks his coffee over.
It is on his pants, the floor, everywhere.

There is an INDUSTRIAL MOP in the room. Norman tries to
detach the mop from the BUCKET AND WRINGER as he speaks, but
it is stuck--

NORMAN (CONT'D)

It is no secret that I’m on Eshel’s
team. I support him. I love him. I
think he is doing amazing things...
but I was just thinking - whoever
this person is, this unnamed
businessman, I probably know him.
Right? Maybe I can shed some light
on whatever it is that happened and
help you make sense of it. Another
point of view for you to consider,
that’s all I’m offering here. If it
helps Eshel too, it is the least I
can do...

Carol is completely bewildered by Norman’s tactics.
Alex seems too shocked to say anything.

And Norman, in the restroom, has finally detached the mop,
splashing soap-water all over himself and the room and
toppling over the bucket.

NORMAN (CONT’D)
What do you say, Alex? Meet me for
coffee. There is a reason why we
met on that train. You never
know... Right? You never know...

Alex looks up at Carol for_her verdict. Reluctantly, Carol
nods her head with approval.

ALEX
How is today at four? Come to my
office in the consulate.

Norman smiles at his reflection in the restroom mirror. He
did it! He got his foot in.

NORMAN
Perfect.

As he grabs a bunch of paper towels out of the dispenser...

INT. STARBUCKS - CONTINUOUS 107
Norman, wet and disheveled, with his wet newspaper still
under his arm, casually exits the restroom, ong his’ over the
puddle that has formed around the door, noddin is head
apologetically to the 3 ANNOYED CUSTOMERS waiting outside.

We catch a glimpse of SHTETL MAN, now standing on line for
coffee. But Norman is too preoccupied to notice him.

Norman is on his phone as he exits the Starbucks.

INT. PHILIP’S OFFICE - DAY 108
PHILIP

(whispering)
I can’t talk to you right now.

EXT. MADISON AVE - DAY 109
Norman walks down the avenue.
NORMAN
Yes you can. Meet me downstairs.

I’m right around the corner from
you.

PHILIP
Did you find out who it is?

NORMAN
Better. I’m meeting the
investigator who is in charge of
the whole thing. Come downstairs.
Give me five minutes.

PHILIP
Norman, I can’t...

But Norman has hung up.

 

EXT. ENTRANCE TO PHILIP’S OFFICE BUILDING - DAY 110
Madison Ave. - busy, crowded mid-town sidewalks, and Norman,
waiting anxiously by the entrance to Philip’s office

building.
Norman sees Philip rushing out.

NORMAN
Thanks for coming down...

PHILIP
What are you doing? You're acting
like a maniac. Look at you...
Why are you getting involved? This
thing is bad for Israel, bad for
America, bad for Jews, bad for
everybody. Step away...

NORMAN
It is bad for everybody, that’s why
I want to help...

PHILIP

How can you help? It’s a political
war going on seven thousand miles
from here. Eshel’s rivals found
this cockamamie story and they’re
going to use it to take him down.
There is nothing you can_do about
it, Don’t get involved. It is too
1g.

Philip looks at Norman to see if his reasoning is entering
his head. It isn’t--

NORMAN
Just tell me one thing.
Hypothetically, if this guy, this
businessman, came to you for
advice. If he wanted you to
represent him. What would you tell
im?

(CONTINUED)
93.

CONTINUED: 110
PHILIP
Why? You want to approach him? It’s
ad idea...
NORMAN

Maybe if we give him an gption that
isn’t so harmful to Eshel.

Philip looks at Norman, trying to figure out what his real
interest here is. Norman is looking back at him, waiting for
an answer.

PHILIP
I'd throw him out of my office.
That’s what I’d do. I wouldn’t want
anything to do with him. He is a
threat to an acting prime minister.
Even if it doesn’t end up having
any criminal implication,
apparently his dealings with Eshel
are embarrassing enough so that his
olitical rivals thin they can _ use
im to hurt Eshel. Eshel’s people
can’t ignore that. They have too
much to lose... They’re going to
strike back. Dig up everything they
can find on this guy. The FBI will
get involved... No matter how you
ook at it, this guy is fucked.
And you want to avoid him like the
plague.

NORMAN
What if you knew him and he was
asking you for help?

Philip takes this in. Suddenly it dawns on him - Norman may
be the unnamed businessman. He carefully considers his next
words.

PHILIP
Are you saying something I don’t
want to hear? What are you saying?

NORMAN ;
I’m not saying anything. I’m just
asking.

PHILIP

Norman, listen to me. Whoever this
unnamed businessman is, he is in
very serious trouble. And he needs
e@ very careful about what he
says now and who he speaks to.

Norman thinks this over for a moment.
NORMAN
I’m only asking if there is a legal

way to defuse this?

NORMAN (CONT'D)
If I’m meeting the investigator,
and I find out who this man is, I
want to be able to offer him
something. Let’s think creatively.

Philip can’t conceal his panic. He takes a step back.

PHILIP
I’m not sure I can offer him
anything. This man needs a very
good criminal lawyer. Don’t be
creative. And don’t meet this
investigator.

They look at each other.

PHILIP (CONT'D)
Can you do that?

Norman seems confused. But he nods his head.

Philip backs away, verifying with his eyes that Norman has
internalized his instructions. He disappears into the
building.

Norman is pacing the street with his phone in his hand. It is
bigger than him. And he can’t resist it...

Across the street, we see THE SHTETL MAN, but Norman doesn’t
notice him.

INT. ISRAELI PARLIAMENT - DAY - ISRAEL 111

Eshel is in his seat on the parliament floor, listening to,
absorbing - a scathing speech delivered with much pathos by
RON MAOR.

We focus on Eshel's face, on Duby’s face, on Hanna’s face, as
they are forced to hear sentences like:

RON MAOR.

We‘ve seen politicians with no
backbone gain power before - that
is not new... We’ve seen political
opportunists who grossly distort

e@ will of the citizens who voted
them into office, only to
shamefully gain favor in the eyes
of foreign rulers in service o
interests that are not our own -
that is not new either. But never
in our nation’s history has a man
of such low moral standing, so
spiritually empty, so
unapologetical y hedonistic,
selfish I dare say - been ina
position to do so much damage to
our people and our nation, as the
man I'm pointing to right now.

Hanna’s phone is blinking. She looks at her screen. It is
NORMAN.

She shows it to Duby, who is standing next to her by the side
door to the parliament hall.

Duby shakes his head.

DUBY
No. Not today. I can’t deal with
Norman.

HANNA

But if I don’t answer he will drive
me crazy all day. He’ll_ call ever
three minutes. It’s easier to jus
answer.

DUBY
Alright, but keep it short. Don’t
let him get involved in anything.

Hanna steps out as she answers her phone.

INT. ISRAELI PARLIAMENT CORRIDORS - DAY - ISRAEL - CONTINUOUS

HANNA
Norman. How are you?

EXT. MANHATTAN STREET - DAY 113

Norman is walking and talking on his phone. Hyper and
excited.

NORMAN
Forget me. How are you??

HANNA
Busy as usual.

NORMAN
Any chance you can connect me to
the prime minister or to Duby?

HANNA
I'm afraid they're...

NORMAN
Wait, before you say no. Listen to
what I have to sa they’ re going
to want to hear t is. m meeting

NORMAN (CONT'D)
I’m going to try and get as much
information as I can, but if Duby
wants to brief me before this
meeting, that might make the
meeting more productive...

Hanna doesn’t know what to say.

HANNA
Norman, I don’t think it is such a
good idea for you...

NORMAN
Will you give them this message?
Tell them I’m meeting with Alex
Green today. They can use me
however they want. I’m like a
puppet in their hands. It’s a
riendly conversation, off the
record... She’s a good friend. I've
known her for years. My wife used
to babysit her...

HANNA
Norman. Hold on a second. Just wait
on the line.

INT/EXT. CHOCOLATIER - DAY - CONTINUOUS 114

Norman stops by the CHOCOLATIER where he saw Eshel in the
beginning of the film while he waits. We see his POV looking
into the shop: beautiful, colorful chocolate treats.

Rich chocolate and direct access to power - his heart is
palpitating with excitement. Finally:

NORMAN
(to his phone)
Duby! I’m so happy to hear your
voice. How are you? What’s going
on? Can you tell me who...

INT. ISRAELI PARLIAMENT CORRIDORS - DAY - ISRAEL 115

We see Duby walking out of the parliament hall with Hanna’‘s
phone, fuming. He enters a SMOKING AREA closed off with glass
walls, where he can finally raise his voice.

DUBY
Shut up, Norman.

NORMAN
What?

DUBY

Shut up and listen to what I’m

saying to you. I don’t want you

meeting anybody on our behalf.

DUBY (CONT'D)
Creating the impression that in
someway you are connected to our
office is a severe punishable
crime. Do you understand me?

SILENCE. Hanna is watching Duby on the other side of the
glass.

DUBY (CONT'D)
I want to make sure I am clear
about this. Stop using the prime
minister’s name. Just stop. Don’t
do it anymore. He is not your
friend and you do not have an
relationship with him. I forbid you
to meet with this woman.

Do you understand what I’m saying?
Answer me.

Norman's eyes are focused on a tray with beautiful NUT COATED
TRUFFLES.

Then the focus changes - reflected in the shop window, Norman
notices the THE SHTETL MAN standing across the street. He
realizes that this man has been following him around since he
first saw him through the Starbucks window.

After a pause.

NORMAN
Yes. I understand.

DUBY
Good. Goodbye Norman.

Duby hangs up, exits the smoking area and hands the phone
back to Hanna as if the phone itself is contaminated.

DUBY (CONT'D)
Enough. Don’t answer his calls
anymore. He is cut off. No more.
Just the thought of him talking to
an investigator makes me want to
vomit. And find out who Alex Green
is...

Something is bothering Hanna.

DUBY (CONT'D)
What is it?

HANNA
I’m not sure it was such a good
idea to insult Norman that way...

UBY
That’s the “problem with these
Normans - they’re a double edged
sword - if you keep them in the
loop, you become more and more
dependant on them until they
gradually own you. - if you cut them
off, they blackmail you for the
rest of your life.

HANNA
I think he is just trying to help.
If you would have told him nicely
that he would be helping us if he
didn’t speak to anyone, I think
that would have been more
effective.

DUBY
I don’t want to talk about Norman
anymore. Lets find out who this
businessman is. I need a name! In a
day every newspaper in the world
ill want to know who this man is
and we need to be prepared...

He walks back into the parliament hall.

INT. ISRAELI PARLIAMENT - DAY - ISRAEL 116

 

With Ron Maor’s speech still in the background, we see Duby
hand a SMALL FOLDED NOTE to an USHER who brings it to Eshel.

RON MAOR (0.S.)

How will we explain this tragicy
historical accident to our children
and grandchildren? How, I ask you?
By. preventing it. By voting against
this dangerous agreement,
masquerading as a peace treaty.
Eshel receives the note. He opens it.

It reads: “WHO IS HE?”

Eshel looks over_at Duby, signaling with his hands and
sincere eyes - “I have no idea”.

RON MAOR (0.S.) (CONT'D)
Giving in to our enemy's /every, la last
demand is not peace!! It’s calle
LOSING!

Heckling and uproar in the room! Duby exchanges a final
concerned glance with Eshel before he leaves the parliament
hall, pulling Hanna with him.

INT. OUTSIDE PARLIAMENT HALL - ISRAEL - CONTINUOUS 117

 

A tight shot on Duby and Hanna.

DUBY
Call Norman. Tell him you want to
apologize for how I spoke to him.
Then tell him we know who the guy
is and we are not worried. This
unnamed businessman has so many
skeletons in his closet, sex
offenses, tax fraud, money
laundering, the man is a total mess
= no prosecutor in the world would
dare put him on the witness stand.

Hanna is confused.

HANNA
You know who he is? Who is he??

DUBY
Just do what I said. And make it
sound as if you are telling this to
him in confidence, behind my back.
Make him swear not to repeat what
he just heard.

Hanna gets it.

HANNA
You think he'll repeat it all to
the investigator.

DUBY
He’1l be trying to prove to her
that he knows what’s going on. And
not only to her. He’ "ut spread the
word all over the place and he’1l
probably exaggerate it so that it
sounds even worse. Call him. Make
him believe there is nothing to
worry about. His beloved prime
minister is perfectly fine.
Go. Make the call.

But how do you A now he is going to
meet with that investigator? You
told him not to.

Duby smiles.
DUBY
Just call him.
EXT. INT. SUBWAY STATION - DAY 118

Norman is going down the escalator towards the Subway in
Grand Central Station. He is on his phone--

NORMAN
He did? --You know who he is, the
businessman?? --...I can’t tell you

how relieved I am to hear you say
this. Thank you, Hanna. Please tell
Duby that I understand his
situation completely. And if there
is anything he needs me to do, he
knows I’m here for him and for the
rime minister. -- That’s what I
ike to_ hear. The prime minister is
a very lucky man to have you on his
side, Hanna. You know that, right?
Really, this kind of loyalty is so
rare. It’s sacred. I hope you know

that... --Of course. Say no more.
My lips are sealed. Good luck,
Hanna.

By now Norman has stepped off the escalator and pulled out
his METRO CARD. But instead of going through the turnstile,
he stops in his steps.

Invigorated with a new sense of purpose, Norman changes his
mind about taking the subway. He turns back to get on the
escalator going back up to Street level.

As he heads up, he sees the Shtetl man on the downward
escalator. THEIR EYES MEET as they pass each other.

The Shtetl man immediately turns around and heads up against
the direction of the escalator, so not to lose Norman.

At this point Norman understands that he is being followed.
He quickly cuts through the crowd towards the exit.

OMITTED 119-121

EXT. STREET, NEAR GRAND CENTRAL STATION - DAY 122

Norman exits Grand Central into the busy street, startled.

We see Norman’s POV - New Yorkers of all ages, color, class
and ethnicity - but no shtetl man.

Then he sees him exit the station, casually walking away.
Norman runs after him.

NORMAN

Hay. You. Hold on a second.
SHTETL MAN

Me?
NORMAN

Yes. You. Why are you following
me? What do you want?

SHTETL MAN
First of all, nice to meet you.
Srul Katz.

Srul pulls out of his pocket a pack of BUSINESS CARDS wrapped
in a rubber band. He wants to give one to Norman, but Norman
steps back.

NORMAN
No. Excuse me. Don’t give me that.
I don’t want it. Stop following me
around. Okay?

SRUL
Why are you angry? Don’t be angry.
I’m not ollowing you around. By
sheer coincidence I happen to be
going where you are goin What do
you want me to do? I apo ogize. I’m
sorry...

Norman looks at the man, evaluating him. He is unkempt, on
the heavy side, with some stains on his shirt and an old,
worn-out hat on his head.

Norman nods his head in disbelief and is about to turn away.

SRUL (CONT'D)
But if we’re alread taiking, If I
can take a few minutes of your
time, I’m glad to finally feet you
in person. You’re the Eshel guy,
right? Oppenheimer. Maybe Zvi Fink
mentioned me to you.

NORMAN
How do you know Zvi?

SRUL

Zvi and I are very close. My wife
ractically grew up in his parents
ouse. I’m helping him out with a
few things. Actually I’m seeing him
later tonight. You should come say
hello. I know he’d be very happy to
see you.

Norman seems confused. He just looks at Srul, not saying a
word.

SRUL (CONT'D)

What’s wrong? You look shaken up.
How can I help you? What do you
need?

NORMAN
What do I need??

SRUL
Yeah. Give me the honor of helping
you out. You’re a choshuv e’man.

Ave.
Srul puts his arm in Norman's and begins to walk with him.

Norman is too surprised by this strange gesture to resist it.
They walk together.

EXT. STREET - DAY 123

Norman and Srul turn the corner together.

SRUL KATZ
So, who’s the guy? Do you know who
he is, the New York businessman?

NORMAN
If I knew, would I tell you?

SRUL KATZ
I heard a rumor. But I was sworn to
secrecy.

NORMAN

Don’t believe what you hear.

SRUL KATZ
You obviously know more than me,
but whoever it is, one thing is for
sure. It’s a conspiracy. They found
a way to assassinate Eshel, without
actually killing him.

Norman thinks about this for a second.

NORMAN
Don’t bury Eshel yet. Trust me.
He’s not going anywhere.

SRUL KATZ
Why, what do you know?

NORMAN
I can’t go into details, but let’s
just say this unnamed | businessman
is... He’s a nobody , a parasite,
trying to extort the prime
minister. He is the ewest of the
low... He made up a story. The
whole thing is made up. Eshel
doesn’t even know the man.

Norman stops. He is suddenly having a hard time stabilizing

his breathing. Srul notices Norman’s stress and waits
patiently for Norman to recompose.

walking in silence.

EXT. STREET, CORNER OF CONSULATE - DAY 124

 

They arrive at the consulate.

NORMAN
I think I’m okay from here on.
Thank you. I appreciate it.

SRUL KATZ oo,
You sure? I’m happy to go in with
you.

NORMAN

No. That’s okay.

SRUL KATZ
I can wait for you outside...

NORMAN
No. Thank you. I’m good from here.
Really, thank you very much. I
appreciate it.

Srul pulls out his business cards and hands one to Norman.

Norman looks at it. It reads: “KATZ STRATEGIES, INC.”

SRUL KATZ
Call me, if you ever need anything.
Anything at all. I’m happy to help.
Zel gezunt.

Norman nods his head, perplexed by the whole encounter.

As Norman walks into the consulate, he turns back to see that
Srul Katz is still standing there, smiling, waving.

INT. ISRAELI CONSULATE - DAY 125

All we see is the back of Norman’s head and his somewhat
distorted reflection in the ONE WAY MIRROR that separates him
from the security guard behind the window.

SECURITY GUARD'S VOICE
Please empty your pockets into the
tray.

A tray is pushed out from the bottom of the window. Norman
pulls out his wallet, keys change Srul Katz’s business
card, and his EPIPEN. He plac he items on the tray.

SECURITY GUARD'S VOICE (CONT’D)
Do you have a cell phone?

NORMAN
I do.

SECURITY GUARD'S VOICE
Please shut it off and put it in
the tray as well.

NORMAN
Will you give it back to me?

SECURITY GUARD'S VOICE
When you leave.

Norman places his phone on the tray. The phone and the rest
of the items are swallowed into the one-way mirror divider.

SECURITY GUARD'S VOICE (CONT’D)
Please enter, collect your
possessions on the tray, and follow
the yellow line to the third door
on your right.

A LOUD BUZZER IS HEARD, UNLOCKING THE DOOR.

INT. CONSULATE SECURITY BOOTH - CONTINUOUS 126

This is a two door system. The second door won’t open until
the first door is closed. But Norman is afraid to have both
doors closed at the same time, so he keeps his foot in the

first door.

The walls of this small, isolated security booth are all
dark, one-way mirrors.

SECURITY GUARD VOICE
Mr. Oppenheimer, you need to close
the first door for the second door
to open.

Before he removes his foot from the door - Norman looks back
outside -

The glare of daylight is strong and blinding, but Norman is
pretty sure Srul Katz is still standing there, smiling.

We sense that Norman is recognizing something in Srul’s face -
as if he has seen this smile before.

Norman presses his face against the one-way mirror to try and
see what is behind it, but all he sees is his own distorted
reflection. Norman panics and tries to reopen the door.

NORMAN

You know what, I forgot something.
I’m canceling’ my meeting. Can I

No response.

NORMAN (CONT’D)

Hello? Anybody there? I’m not going

in. Can I have my stuff back?

Hello... Hello... please, open the

door! Open the door!

A LOUD BUZZER IS HEARD. The second door unlocks. Norman
opens the second door and goes through. The door shuts on our
lens, creating a BLACK SCREEN.

We hear over black:

ALEX'S VOICE
It’s Okay. Come.

NORMAN'S VOICE
They told me not to meet with you.
EXT. STREETS OF NEW YORK - NIGHT A127

It is the end of the work day, Manhattan at its most crowded
hour.

Everything is a blur, except for Norman, walking the streets,
lost in a daze, with his phone in one hand, and an ENVELOPE
in the other.

We close in on Norman’s face. His eyes are BLOODSHOT AND
SWOLLEN.
INT. ISRAELI CONSULATE CORRIDOR 127

Please, I should really go. I
apologize, I respect you very much,
but I°-can’t do this. This is
serious. I shouldn’t have called

Cut to a shot of:

We see a FLASH OF ALEX sitting behind a desk in her office.

Rushed New Yorkers walking around him pay no attention to
him. Then a shot of:

INT. ALEX’S OFFICE 132

And now finally we see Alex in her office, in sync, speaking
directly to Norman.

Over her head, on the office walls, we see FRAMED PICTURES,
with images of the Israeli Tourism Ministry's version of
Middle Eastern bliss:

--THE FISH, --THE DEAD SEA, -- THE FARMERS, --_THE CAMEL-—
they are all framed pictures hanging on the wall behind Alex.
Our focus changes to Alex’s face.

ALEX
Because I think the kind of
relationship you’‘ve established
with the prime minister of Israel
is illegal. I think it is corrupt.

INT. MEN’S CLOTHING BOUTIQUE - DAY A133
A shot of Eshel reflected in the mirrors of the fitting room

Norman is smiling, but by now we know him well enough to
sense a nervousness in his eyes and the itch around his neck.

WE HEAR THE SOUND OF A MOVING TRAIN, taking us to:

INT./EXT. TRAIN - NIGHT 133

We flash back to the scene on the train from Washington to
New York. Alex and Norman are reflected in the train window.
Their faces are lit by a passing dight from outside the
moving train creating a strobing effect.

ALEX
Do you have a specific area of
expertise? Can you explain to me
how your business works? If it is

not too complicated... I’m curious.
NORMAN

Have you ever played rummikub?
ALEX

Sure.
NORMAN

My mother used to_hate playing with
me, because I would mess up the
board, break up existing sets and
try to create new ones with
whatever lousy pieces I had on my
rack. Sometimes I'd mess it up so
bad, there was no way to put
everything back. My mother would go
crazy. She’d say, if you don’t have
a specific, simple move, just pick
up a tile and let the game continue
to_the next player. But usually,
all I needed to finish my turn, is
one little Joker. That’s all you
need. If you have the Joker, you
can afford to take some risks.
Somehow, with a Joker in your hand,
all the tiles fall into place.

ALEX |
I’m sorry. I still don’t
understand...

NORMAN
That’s what I do. I’m the Joker. As
soon as you put me in the game,
things work out. Here, let me show
you.

Norman refers to the yellow legal pad with the diagrams he
had drawn for her. It takes us back to:

INT. ALEX’S OFFICE - DAY 134

We see Alex’s LEGAL PAD on the table with the diagrams and
names that Norman wrote down on that train ride. Our view
tilts up from the diagram to Alex's face.

ALEX
The unnamed New York businessman -
You are that man, Norman. You are
our witness.

NORMAN
No, I'm not.

FLASH to Norman walking in the busy street. He closes his

saying.

INT. AIPAC CONVENTION HALL B135

Norman is looking around at the forest of human encounters
frozen in time. At once, everyone in the room TURNS TO LOOK
DIRECTLY A HIM.

We see Norman, in a panic, clutch his EPIPEN.

INT. ALEX’S OFFICE - DAY C135
ALEX
We can subpoena you. You have no
choice.

This does not come naturally for Alex, but she reaches out
and touches Norman’s trembling hand. Norman needs this
gesture. He allows her to keep her fingers over his hand for
afew gcconds. By now, his face, his eyes, are EXTREMELY

NORMAN
I have to leave now. I’m sorry.

ALEX
You need to hear what I have to
say. We are arranging an early
deposition for you tomorrow. I

Alex has an ENVELOPE in her free hand. She places it on the
table in front of Norman. Norman pulls his hand away and
gets up to leave.

ALEX (CONT'D)
This is your official notice...

NORMAN
Do they know it is me?
ALEX
Who?
NORMAN
Duby, Hanna... Eshel. Do they know

There is an ITCH that Norman feels around his collar bone, he
scratches it violently, without any awareness that he is
doing this.
NORMAN
But what will Eshel do to me?
ALEX
They will try to convince the court
and the public that you are an
unreliable witness. That will most
likely be their defense.
Norman nods his head. Alex hands him the NOTICE.

Norman hesitates for a brief moment, then he takes the
envelope. Right before he exits the room--

ALEX (CONT'D)
I’m sorry.

Norman turns around and leaves.

EXT. PARK AVE. - NIGHT D135
Norman is standing on the median of Park Ave. in Midtown,
looking down at the ENVELOPE. He is frozen stiff in the
middle of one of the busiest spots in the world.

INT. PRIME MINISTER'S OFFICE, CABINET ROOM - NIGHT - ISRAHG5
On Eshel’s shocked face.

The camera pulls back to reveal Duby whispering into Eshel’s
ear, while Eshel is sitting at the center of a room, waiting
for a cabinet meeting to begin.

We see Hanna standing near by, holding her phone in her fist.
Eshel wants to say something, but in this setting he can’t

say a word. He looks over at Duby Duby steps back, out of
the light. A SHADOW falls over Duby’ s face.

111.

A SERIES OF SKETCHES - SUPERIMPOSED: 137

 

Cartoons, caricatures - of Norman in relation to the prime
minister, under the sound of Duby’s voice.

DUBY (V.O.)
Right now, very few people know who
Norman Oppenheimer is, but in a few
days everyone will want to. We have
an opportunity to brand him...

First caricature: Norman is a rich uncle offering a lollipop
to an innocent, child-like prime minister on a street corner.

DUBY (V.0.)
...-To introduce him to the world in
a way that will disqualify him as
witness and at the same time paint
the prime minister as an innocent
victim.

Second caricature: Norman as a stray mutt latching onto the
prime minister’s leg as he tries to shake him off with an
olive branch on his way up to receiving the Nobel peace
prize.

DUBY, (V.0.)
If our leader is a victim... We are
all victims...

Third Caricature: Norman is the sore toe on the foot of an
aching prime minister portrayed as Atlas with a globe
weighing heavily on his shoulders.

ESHEL
How am I victim? We are too
powerful to be victims...

DUBY (V.O.)
Never say that... It is not true.

Fourth caricature: A Cinderella-like situation. Norman, with
a devious smirk on his face, trying to fit a shoe on Eshel’s
foot. Eshel appearing as a delicate, beautiful princess.

INT. PRIME MINISTER’S OFFICE - NIGHT - ISRAEL 138
On Eshel’s face sitting behind his desk. He looks devastated.

DUBY
You are Mr. Peace right now. The
press will be on your side - Nobody
wants to see our peace efforts go
down the drain because of the
fantasies of some Jewish macher. We
need to portray him as a delusional
name-dropper who has been sucking
your blood for years.

DUBY (CONT'D)
You need to say this in a clear
way, not only because it is
necessary, but because it is true.

Eshel exchanges a look with Hanna.

ESHEL
There must be another way. Norman
is a friend. A very generous
friend. I can’t hurt him.

DUBY
It is not about you and him. It is
much bigger than whatever personal
feelings you might have right now.
And bigger than the pain it brings
on any one person.

Eshel is shaking his head, he needs more...

DUBY (CONT'D)
Norman Oppenheimer is a threat to
our national interests.

You_need to treat him like you
would any other threat. This is not
your choice. It is your duty.

It sinks in.

SLOW DISSOLVE FROM ESHEL’S FACE TO NORMAN, STANDING AT:

EXT. PARK AVE. - NIGHT 139

Norman is standing on the median of Park Ave., waiting for
the LIGHT to change. He takes a deep breath.

He_ sees A MAN ON A BIKE in the middle of the street,
balancing himself on his bike with both feet on the pedals as
he waits for the light to change.

The biker is in his 40s, wearing a business suit, tie anda
helmet on his head. He is determined to stay on his bike for
the duration of the light without putting his feet down.

Norman’s PHONE RINGS. He looks at the screen. It is PHILIP
COHEN.
INT. PHILIP’S OFFICE - NIGHT 140

Philip is on the phone. They are silent for a moment.
Finally.

NORMAN
I took your advice. I didn’t g° to
the meeting. I’m stepping bac

Philip doesn’t know how to respond. Across from his desk, on
a shelf, one of the many framed pictures we see of Philip
with different sports celebrities and politicians, is a
PICTURE OF ESHEL, PHILIP and NORMAN, taken at the Aipac
convention. Finally—-

PHILIP
I’m proud of you. Good move.

Another beat of silence.

PHILIP (CONT'D)
Are you there, Norman?

Norman's eyes are fixed on the BIKER as he skillfully
maneuvers his body on the bike to keep from falling, without
advancing into the busy intersection.

NORMAN
I’m here.

PHILIP
You okay?

NORMAN

I’m fine. I think my body is
reacting to something I ate. I'll
take a Benadryl. I’1l be fine...

PHILIP
Good. Good. ...I wish _I could be
more helpful... but, I don’t...

NORMAN
(cutting him off)
I’m a good swimmer, Philip. Don’t
worry. As long as my head is above

water...

PHILIP
You are a good swimmer. That’s for
sure.

NORMAN

You have been a very big help,
Philip. Thank you. I appreciate it.
Thank you.

Philip is silent. He can hardly breathe. His face is red.
Norman hangs up.

Finally the LIGHT CHANGES and the biker pedals forward with
the rest of the traffic. Norman hails a cab.

EXT. RABBI BLUMENTHAL’S SYNAGOGUE - NIGHT 141
Norman exits the cab in front of the synagogue.

He tries to open the door to the synagogue but it is locked.

He RINGS THE BUZZER. There is no response.

EXT. SYNAGOGUE ALLEY - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 142

Norman walks around the building into the narrow alley where
there is a decorative window into the main sanctuary.

Norman climbs on a garbage can and peeks through.

The sight of the dimly lit empty sanctuary is comforting for
Norman, so he just stands there with his face pressed against
the window. Then:

MAN’S VOICE
Can I help you?

Norman turns around. It is Rabbi Blumenthal.

NORMAN
Rabbi!

RABBI BLUMENTHAL
You! What are you doing here??

NORMAN
I need to talk to you.

RABBI BLUMENTHAL

You need to sign those escrow
papers, that’s what you need. Do
you realize we are going to lose
all our pledges if this anonymous
donor doesn’t come through, not to
mention this building, and my job!

Why aren’ t you answering my phone

s??

Norman, still standing on the garbage can, says nothing.
Rabbi Blumenthal understands what Norman’s silence means.

k RABBI BLUMENTHAL (CONT’D)
Fuck!

NORMAN
I’m working on it.

RABBI BLUMENTHAL
Fuck!!

He kicks the garbage can. Norman falls to the ground!

Rabbi Blumenthal kicks one of the garbage bags right into
Norman’s face.

RABBI BLUMENTHAL (CONT’D)
I should have known. I should have
known not to trust you. I should
have known. It’s my fault. What do
I do now??

Norman, on the ground, covered in garbage, just looks at him
with nothing to say.

RABBI BLUMENTHAL (CONT'D)
Was there a donor? At any point?
Ever? Or did you just make him up?
NORMAN
I thought I had someone. And I
might still have him. But it is not
a sure thing...

They look at each other. When Norman finally tells the truth,
there is something disarming about his demeanor.

RABBI BLUMENTHAL
Then why did you tell us you had a
donor? Why would you do that?

NORMAN
I don’t know.

The rabbi shakes his head in despair and walks away.

Norman sits himself up and leans against the wall, removing
pieces of PICKLED HERRING from his coat and face.

Then-- HIS PHONE RINGS!

Norman locates his phone and looks at his screen: ESHEL
PRIVATE CELL

Norman takes a deep breath.

INTERCUT WITH:

EXT. ESHEL’S PRIVATE RESIDENCE - SUNRISE - ISRAEL 143

Eshel, with his phone to his ear, is in his private garden.
The sun is coming up.

Norman finally answers, but doesn’t say a word.

ESHEL
Is that you, Norman?

SILENCE.

ESHEL (CONT'D)
Norman, are you there?

NORMAN
Is it safe for us to talk?

ESHEL
It probably isn’t. But there is
something I need to tell you before
the lawyers and PR people take
over.

(CONTINUED)
143

CONTINUED:
ESHEL (CONT'D)
And I am speaking to you now as
Micha Eshe not as the prime
minister of Israel.
(he pauses )
I’m sorry. I’m sorry for what is
about to happen to you. In the next
couple of days you are going to
hear me saying things that I don’t
really believe. Things about you.
And it will hurt. It will hurt both
of us. But the only reason I will
be saying these things is because
there are hundreds of thousands of
lives at stake. The enemies of
peace have decided to step all over
you on their way to behead me. It
is a terrible price to pay, but
Norman, I can’t let them win. We
can’t let them win.

SILENCE.
ESHEL (CONT'D)

Do you accept my apology, Norman?
Do you forgive me?

Norman looks up to the sliver of sky that can be seen

There is a tense silence on both sides of the line. Finally:

NORMAN
I will never betray you.

The streets are still empty.

Norman crosses a deserted and freezing street into Central
Park.

As in the first sequence of the film, this is the hour of the
fanatics.

Norman is sitting on the same bench, watching them pass by in
their futuristic winter sportswear.

He sees Bill Kavish finishing his run and finding a spot for
his stretches.

Bill sees Norman. Norman approaches.

NORMAN
Good morning, Bill.

BILL
Way do you do this? Why do you
ave this way? Why can’t anything
ever be simple with you?

NORMAN
Who says simple is good?

Bill looks at Norman. Strangely, Norman’s answer is actually
quite - simple.

Definitely not now, with your
friend in trouble...

Norman nods his head, looks at Bill stretch his groin. He
turns around and walks away. Then:

BILL (CONT'D)
Wait.

Norman stops.

BILL (CONT'D)

I'm listening.

Out of respect , to my father. You
knew him, didn’t you?

Norman nods his head. But before any sentimentality settles
in--

BILL (CONT'D)
What have you got?

NORMAN
If you knew with one hundred
percent certainty that the witness
who is threatening to topple down.
prime minister Eshel will never
testify, would you know how to
make money with that information?

Bill is intrigued.

BILL
Del epends where and how I got the
ormation and if I can verify
it... You_realize that you are not
a very reliable source, right?

NORMAN
Put me in a room with Jo Wilf. I'll
give him the certainty he needs.

Bill is hesitating.

NORMAN (CONT’D)

Think about it. Do the numbers.
Come up with something. You have

EXT. 7TH AVE. EARLY MORNING 147

New York is waking UP. Commuters are exiting the subway
stations, flooding the streets.

Shops are opening. Street vendors are setting up for the day.
Norman is strolling on the sidewalk, in a pace and world of
his own. For the first time in this film, he seems -
tranquil.

An innocent looking, perfectly standard NYC, (NUTS 4 NUTS)
NUT VENDOR enters Norman’s POV.

It is a cold morning, the OWNER of the nut-stand, wrapped in
his puffy winter coat, engulfed in the roasting Smoke,

acknowledges Norman who is looking down into the different
types of sugar coated nuts.

EXT. 57TH ST. AND 7TH AVE - DAY 148
We are outside the Brooklyn Diner on 57th St. Through one of
the windows we see Norman and Jo Wilf sitting across from
each other in a booth.

We can’t hear them, but we see that while Norman is
explaining his idea, he is writing his usual diagrams on a
NAPKIN, names, numbers and a scheme of lines connecting them
all. At a certain point, he hands the napkin to Jo. Jo looks
at it. He seems impressed. They and shake hands.

We are close on his face, his eyes.

Norman finds a lone chair in one of the corners of this
beautiful urban miracle - the closest thing Manhattan has to

a town square.

He is surrounded by massive office buildings, the monumental
geandeur of the Public Library, anda horde of busy New
orkers all around him, paying absolutely no attention to the
lonely man holding a bag of peanuts.

Norman opens the bag, pulls out a nut, puts it in his mouth.
