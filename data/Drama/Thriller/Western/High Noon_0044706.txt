40 High Noon
SOME NOTES ASQUT THIS STORY

THE TIME is about 1870 or 1875.

THE PLACE is HADLEYVILLE, population around 400, located
in a Western territory still to be determined, a town just old
enough to have become pleasantly aware of its existence, and to
begin thinking of {ts appearance.

There is one street, a rambling, crooked affair that
begins at the railroad station, meanders along through the town,
ends a little way past the relatively new Commercial Hotel, and
then becomes a narrow and disappearing path into the prairie. Most
of the people in town, particularly those in better eireumstances,
have built houses away from the street, end some of them even have
small lawns and flower patches, most of them rather pathetic.

Between the station and the hotel are to be found the
majority of the settings for the action of the story: the Marshal's
office and the courtroom, the Ramirez Bar, the barber shop, the
general store, the livery stable. Other establishments that should
be indicated but will not be used (as of this writing) will be in
tune with the place and period: «a bank, restaurants, rooming houses,
a millinery shop, a hand laundry, etc. Almost all the buildings
along the street have some kind of structures behind them, such as
outhouses or sheds or, in some cases, Living quarters.

Not so long ago, Hadleyville, Like many other frentier
towns that vere at the mercy of nearby feudal barons, had been
terrorized by Gil Jordan and his retainers. From his ranch, Gil
Jordan had ruled Hadleyville, and ruled {t ruthlessly and eruelly.
There are still men == and women, too =~ who bear the physical marks
of Jordan's maniacal rages, Five years ago, hovever, Marshal Will
Doane, backed by a half a dozen harderiding deputies, had broken
the Jordan gang and arrested Jordan for murder. At his trial, he
had been sentenced to hang, but Jordan's influential friends in the
territorial capital hed had his sentence commuted to Life imprison-
ment. Now, five years later, Hadleyville is a safe place for vomen
and children. Law end order have been so firmly established that
Doane new has only two deputies.

THE PEOPLE are MARSHAL WILL DOANE, HELEN RAMIREZ,
AMY DOANE, HARVEY PELL and others.

WILL DOANE is in his middle thirties. Adequately
educated, he is a second-generation westerner in a land thet is
still spreading out. Like most of the other citizens of Hadleyvilie,
he is not a native of the town. He is direct, practical, aot too

articulate. His approach to the job cf peace officer is matter-or-
fact, umtomantic, but in the five years that he has been town
marshal be has alvays Liked it. He hes enjoyed the prestige it has
given bim, and the knowledge that he 1s respected and liked by the
townspeople. Now that he is being married, he is Leaving the job
and the town with some regret, but secure in the feeling that he is
doing the sensible thing {mn moving to another town, where a general
store should do good business.

He {s, certainly, not an average man, cut a very human
ome. Some tvo years ago be had a somewhat Lengthy affair with:

HELEN RAMIREZ. She is two or three years older than
Doane, a victim of an era and environment vith rigid social stand-
ards. To begin with, Helen is half Mexican, end thus neither
acceptable to the “pure” American vomen of the region, nor eligible
for a "good" marriage. Consequently, in eddition to being intelli-
gent, atrewd and strong-willed, she is also hard and resentful.
Physically, she is handsome, full-treasted, passionate. More, she
has style, personality.

Some yeers ago, Helen hed carried Ramirez, the Local
salocn-keeper. After his death she hed become Gil Jordan's mistress,
With Jordan in jail for Lite, Helen had herself selected Will Deane
as his successor, and Helen still cannot forgive Doane for ending
the lisscn, for this is a priviledge she reserves for herselr.
Recently, she had allowed herself to drift into an affair with
Harvey Pell, Doane's friend end deputy. A good business women, she
bas long since disposed of her interest in the Ramirez saloon, ent
ds a silent partner in the town's general store.

AMY DOANE is, withoyt kmowing it, one of the new vomen
of the period, women who are beginning to rebel against the Limit-
ations ani restrictions of the Victorian epoch. Young, attractive,
iirtelligemt, strong-willed, Amy is determined not to be a sheltered
toyewife but @ full partner in her merciage, and it is she who has
Planned their future. More, Amy has strong emotional emi intellectual.
convictions against any form of violence, because ber father and
brothers vere killed while taking part in Vigilante action, end
she has since embraced the Quaker faith. Marziage to Doane would
have been unthinkable had he remained a peace officer.

HARVEY PELL is younger than Deane, his deputy and friend.
But beneeth that friendship is a nagging sense of inferiority and an
envy of Deane. Thus, although he has secretly taken Doane's place
as Helen's lover, he has a feeling that he has oot really replaced
Deane. In addition, Harvey is ambitious, amicus to preve his manhood
acd importance. He bas hoped to be appointed Mersbel in Doane's
Place, ami he has expected that Deane would secure the position for
him. Since the promotion has not taken place, he is resentful towards
Deane for this as well. Yet, with all this, there is a remnant cf
the old liking. Doane, however, is unaware of the change in Harvey's
feelings toward hin.

 
42 High Noon

OTHERS ARE: PERCY METTRICK, Justice of the Peace;
JONAS HENDERSON, WILLIAM FULLER and MARTIN ECWE, selectmen; MILT
JORDAN, PIERCE and COLSY, remnants of the Jordan gang; SAM, Helen's
elderly retainer; TOBY, Doane's other deputy; and a surprising
cumber of other bitg,

METTRICK is urbane, cultured, cynical, unmarried,
middle-aged.

BENDERSON AND FULLER, and their WIVES, are in the same
age category, and very solid citizens.

MART HOWE is about sixty, a bachelor. He has been a
peace officer all his life, but age and the arthritis that has
crippled his hands have caused his retirement some years before,

MILT JORDAN, Gil's younger brother, JAMES PIERCE and
JACK COLBY are all that remain of the Jordan bunch. Milt is handsome,
wild, with cruel eyes and a quick, meaningless smile. Colby is
dour, remote, indrawmn. Pierce, the oldest amd the leader, is a
chronically sour-tempered man, nervous and irritable.

SAM 12 a thin, leathery, taciturn man about Martin Hove's
age. He looks as if he has known a considerable amount of viclence
and hard-Living (and probably lawlessness) in his time, from vhich --
Like Mart Howe -- he has retired, but in his own way. Helen Ramirez
ia the only person in town += and perhaps the vorld << for whom he has
any feeling. You sense that he is intensely loyal and devoted, that
he understands and admires her, and that he {s content to be her
watch-dog.

DR. MARIN, the minister, is a sincere, devout, unworldly
man, vho hag hia share of human veakness.

TOBY, Doane's other Deputy, is about Harvey Pell's age.
Lacking Harvey's tense drive, he is good-natured, easy-,oing,
dependable in a fight.

Other characters vill be descrited as ve go along. How-
ever, while ve ere here, ve omy es wall deserthe the settings for
some of the scenes to follow.

These are: (1) the Commercial Hotel, (2) Helen Ramirez’
rooms, (3) the courtroom, (4) the Marshal's office, (5) the Ramirez
Bar, (6) the Barbershop, (7) the livery stable, (8) the Church,

(9) the reilread station, (10) Martin Howe's home, (11) Willian
Fuller's home, (12) the general store, and (13) Mendosa's place.

The COMMERCIAL HOTEL would seem to be about six years
old. It is a tworstory building. The desk is in the center hall,
on one side cf which is the small Lobby, and on the other, cut orf
from view by curtains or swinging doors, the dining room. From the
hall, a stairvey leads up to the second floor, where all rooms are
entered from the ball.

HELEN RAMIREZ cecupies two connecting rooms on the
second floor of the hotel, toward the front. One is her bedroom
and the other has been furnished as a kind of sitting room or what

was called a front room then. The front room overlooks che street.
Her taste is fairly expensive, feminine and god.

WILL DOANE'S OFFICE, which he shares vith Judge
Hattrick, ig e one-story building on the main street. On one
wide of the office is the COURTROOM and on the other the jail. ‘The
courtroom is still a somewhat makeshift affair, but the bench,
witness stant, jury bax, attorney tables and spectators’ saction
can be recognized. We will probably not see the jail. The Doane-
Mattrick office should be large enough to contain two desks, chairs,
etc, The "Gun-Fighter” had a very good marshal's office.

The RAMIREZ BAR is a typical small smloon of the period ~~
a bar end some tables, tut no dance floor, no stage, no glittering
gambling layouts.

THE CHURCH has a capacity ef about 200, a small wooden
structure. It has a small orgen, or viatever they were called then,
and behind the pulpit there hengs a large painted replica cf the
Ten Commandments.

THE BARBER SHOP bas one chair and ea round card table.
The window bears the following legemi; BARBER SHOP AMD DENTIST.

HOT BATES. ‘Then lower down, and in smaller letters: DICNIFIED
UNDERTAKING. H. LeSIEUR, PROP. Behind the shop are living quarters
1 and space designed for Mr. LeSieur's other activities, but ve will

{ _ + ea none cf these except the shed vhere coffins ars built ani atored,

MART HOWE'S HOME is small, simple, almost berren
reflecting his bachelorhoed. WILLIAM FULLER'S HOME is Larger, more
affluently furnished in the taste of the period, and fussy, showing
the hand and taste of bis wife. Although ve will use both exteriors,
we will probably see only the living-room of each house.

TRE LIVERY STABLE fronts on the main street, but the
stable pert, where the horses are stalled, is at the rear, and out
of sight and hearing from the street.

EE RATLROAD STATION, for our purposes, is one small
Duilding. Part of this is veiting reon, and part has been parti-
tioned off to be the Station-Master’s Office. The office windows
look out to the track and to a large bench outside. It {s presently
planned to play the material with Milt Jordan, Pierce ami Colby
Qakside the station house.

THE GENERAL STORE is e@ typical store cf the period. If
possible, it should be indicated that the store is a prosperous one.
It shouldn't be too larga, though.

MENDOZA'S PLACE is a stopping-af? place some five or
ten miles from town, containing rode accomodations for horses end
humans. Yor cur purposes, we vill probebly see only the corral,
the exterior of the building ami the interior of the combined bar
and eating space -—- in other words, one large room containing a bar,
cables, a large fireplace, etc. It is not a fancy place. For a
good picturization of this kind of establishment, you should see
"Stage-Coach.”

13.

A.M., amd the sun is high and hot in a clear sky. Near a
landmark of some kind -- @ tree or an OUt-cropping of rock «-
a Man on horseback waits. In the distance, another Rider
appears, riding toward the waiting Man. Now, the MALY
end CREDIT TITLES APPEAR. Behind them, the Rider reaches
the Man who is waiting. They recognize each other, wave
briefly, wait together. The distant bells of an o.s.
Church begin to toll. From ANOTHER ANGLE, a Third Rider
allops toward them. He reaches them. The Pirst Man
takes cut bis watch as the FINAL CARD APPEARS AND PADES.
We are in CLOSE to the three Mec now, close enough to see
that they are travel-veary and grin, sen vho seem to be
driven by a mixture of hatred and hunger. tn the order
of their appearance, they ere JAMES PIERCE, JACK cOLgY
and MILT JORDAN. Pierce snaps bis vatch=case shut, puts
it away, neds briefly to the others, He. spurs his horse,
and they follow him. CAMERA PANS and EOLDS as they ride

be seen above screening trees.

EXT. CHURCH. Its bell tolls calmly and unhurriedly, and
the people going into it move terpidly, hot and uncomfor-
table in their Sunday test. Along the resd that winds past
the churth, Jordan, Pierce and Colby appear ami ride by.
They are too far from the church to be recognized by any
of the people going in, and when they pass the CAMERA as
they ride away from it they seem solivious to dt. Although
they are only cantering, they ride with purpowe, and it is
as if the church and the people do not even impinge them-
selves on their consciousnesses. Ag they move cut of
scene, they pass 4 wagon which has come to 4 step in the
f.g. A Man and his Wife are in the wagon, and as the Man
starts to climb down, he sees the Three Riders. He Looks
after them thoughtfully.

EXT. MAIN STREET. It bakes in the sun, a rather crooked
amd winding street that seems deserted now in the Sunday
calm. Jordan, Pierce ami Colby canter inte the scene and
ride avay from CAMERA.

SOUND of the approaching horses. HARVEY FELL enters the
scene from behind her, and dravs her back into the room.

Tor. HELEN'S FRONT ROOM. Harvey draws Helen into bis arms,
aod she accepts the familiar embrace. The purely physical
attraction each has for the other is obvious. But the sound
of the approaching horses comes nearer. Helen's guze strays
to the window. She recognizes the Taree Riders below. che

windov. Harvey cranes his neck to follow her geze.

banish him. However, vhen ne

same citizens not only opened
the gates to him, but stood by
while he executed the senbers
of the legal government. . . . A
similar thing took place about
eight yeers ago in a town called
Indian Falls. I escaped death

Harvey Looks at the other occupants at the bar and sees

Harvey turns awey and pours himself a drink with fingers
trembling vith rage. Then, as he drinks, bis glance moves
