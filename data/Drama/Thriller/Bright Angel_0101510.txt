FADE IN:
EXT. DUCK MARSH - DAWN

JACK RUSSELL and his 18-year-old son, GEORGE, crouch in a
makeshift cattail blind. Roosting ducks are dropping into
the marsh. on the water floats an arrangement of duck
decoys which have lured the ducks to the pond.
In the blind, Jack holds a long-barrel, semi-automatic
shotgun. George mans a sealed-beam car-light hooked to a
portable car battery. The light is not yet shining. Jack
peeks through at the ducks while George keeps his head down,
checking and retwisting the connections to the battery.
It’s mid-June on the northern Montana Hi-line, and it’s
chilly as the sky barely lightens eastward. The ducks :
settle and the marsh goes quiet. Jack, in the blind, takes
_a long, deep breath, squeezes off the safety of his shotgun,
regards his son beside hin.

JACK
Shine, George. Shine now.

George clicks the crude switch on the car-light and the
yellow beam streams out onto the marsh surface through the
cattails. The ducks are there, all of them on the water,
completely exposed and not yet alarmed by the light. Jack
stands and begins shooting down on the water with the
shotgun, methodical shooting, not fast, but gauged to cover
as much of the water as he can. Most of the ducks are hit
sitting in the water, but some fall just as they begin to
lift off. Jack shoots, in all, eleven times. On the water
after the last gun blast, there are 54 ducks dead or dying.

JACK

(quietly)
Well. There’s that.

GEORGE
Yessir.

. JACK
A lot of ‘em. A lot of ‘em that
time. Good work on the light,
George. You were steady as a rock.

Jack and George begin to wade into the marsh to collect the
' @ucks floating there.
EXT. RURAL MEAT LOCKER/SLAUGHTER HOUSE ~ EARLY MORNING
Jack drives his truck up to a local meat locker/slaughter
house, HONKS his horn. The LOCKER OWNER walks out while
George grabs sacks of ducks from under a tarp in the truck
cab. Jack stays behind the wheel.

LOCKER OWNER
(to Jack)
How many?

JACK
Forty-three Mallards. . Mostly
green~heads.

LOCKER OWNER
Did you see any game wardens out
there?

JACK
(sarcastic, smiling)
Saw a hundred of ‘em. They just
didn’t see me.

The Locker Owner begins to count out cash from his pocket
into Jack’s hand. George sees the transaction as he walks
with the sacks toward the slaughterhouse.
LOCKER OWNER
(counting)
How’s the railroad, Jack?

JACK
Mean and lean. Pay’s regular.

4 INT./EXT. GRAIN ELEVATOR/ Broadview- AFTERNOON
George finishes a hot, airless job cleaning the inside of an
elevator which has just been emptied. He is sweaty and
dusty. He exits, goes inside an airless little washroom,
washes his hands and face. He exits the silo, starts walking
toward town.
5 EXT. POLAR BAR/ Broadview AFTERNOON
George crosses street and enters Polar Bar.
Sunburst is a tiny, grain-elevator town built on the Great
Northern Railway, twenty miles south of the Alberta border.
6 INT. POLAR BAR - AFTERNOON

The room is convivial and peopled by a few farmers and
railroad crewmen, a country bar with a few poker, keno

machines, high school football schedules tacked to the back
bar walls.

Jack sits at the bar smoking a cigarette over his beer and
whiskey. He is a railroad brakeman, 44, a tough, soft-
spoken man whose life has dropped him in a place he might
not have planned, but that he’s made accommodations for.
He’s mildly drunk.

George loads nickels into one of the poker machines against
the walls, hitting the buttons, while one of the older bar

habitues, slightly drunk watches him from the nert, machine, *

BAR HABITUE *
Ace George! . Jesus you can't :

win this game. This game's

rigged against you. You better

quit. (Laughs. ) .

George gives the machine a hard shove and a kick. He turns,
glances at his father at the bar. A MAN--a fellow
railroader--is huddled with Jack, talking seriously. Their
conversation can’t be heard. The man puts his arm on Jack’s
back, says another ardent word, then walks out of the bar.
George turns away from the poker machine and walks to where
Jack is sitting at the bar. Jack is moody, as if he’s heard
bad news.

GEORGE
What’s happening?

The BARTENDER drifts past Jack’s empty glasses.

BARTENDER
Ready for another one, Jack?

JACK
(ignoring him, to George)
Let’s get out of the bar. Okay? I
saved back three quackers. [711
grill ‘em. Do something different.
Surprise your mother.

GEORGE
(uneasy)
Good. That’1l make her happy.

Jack takes a painful pinch of George’s belly, using his hard
grip.

JACK
you can’t box on dead legs. You
gonna make your weight? -

GEORGE
I think so.

JACK
It'd actually be nice to come ina
little over. That’s the way you
win.

GEORGE
(patiently)
Ican’t. You can’t do that anymore.

CLAUDE PHILLIPS enters the bar and motions to George from
the door. Claude is 19, dark, black-haired and good-
looking, a full-blooded Blackfeet Indian who looks more
Latin than Indian. He’s a wild boy, already sophisticated
with girls, whereas George is less savvy, more home-turning
but restless for some kind of action.

CLAUDE
(to George) .
Come here. I wanna show you

something.
George walks to his father, who’s obviously on his mind.

GEORGE
I’m, uh, going outside with Claude
just for a minute. I/11 be right
back.

Jack looks skeptically across the bar at Claude.

JACK
Don’t fuck around. Okay. I’m not
stayin’ long.

GEORGE
I won't. I-promise. :
Jack makes a pistol gesture at Claude, who smiles roguishly
back. He and George exit.

7 EXT. BROADVIEW STREET - LATE AFTERNOON 7

Something is clearly up with Claude. He’s in high spirits.
They walk, hurrying toward Claude’s car, a ‘72 Chevy junker,
which is across the street.

CLAUDE

Get in the car with me, asshole.
GEORGE

What is it?
CLAUDE

Sherman’s got a woman with him out
at the motel, which is typical. He
dead-headed her in from Havre last
night. .Now he wants out of it. So
who does he call? His son. I’m
going to get him out of it. It
oughta be funny. I guess you don’t
want to see it, though.

GEORGE
I’ll see it. I’d like to have a
look at it.
They enter the car.
8 INT. CAR - LATE AFTERNOON . 8

Claude produces a half-pint vodka bottle from under the
visor, and they each take a drink.

CLAUDE
Sherman forgets where he hides it.

Claude laughs, takes a drink, gives the bottle over to
George. : .

GEORGE
(laughing)
Rocket fuel!

CLAUDE
Fire up your missile.

They drive out of town.

9 EXT. SONIC MOTEL - LATE AFTERNOON 9
The Sonic Motel is a little cottage camp with 6 units and a
skinny gravel lot. Claude drives in behind the pickup and
HONKS his horn. George looks at the office cabin.

A woman--the MANAGER--is standing in the doorway watching.

A 7-year-old child is playing in front of the office in the
dust. After a moment, the cabin door opens and SHERMAN
PHILLIPS steps outside, closes the door behind him and walks

to Claude’s car.

sie. GEORGE
What does your mother think about
this?
CLAUDE

She married a gash hound. Here
comes the great lady’s man. The big
Indian.

Claude revs the engine. Sherman is a large, dark Indian
with a big, tight belly. He wears glasses and is in his
socks and has on a long-sleeved white shirt. His hair is
tied in a long ponytail.

CLAUDE (CONT’D)
Clear conscience is no conscience.

SHERMAN
You two’re drunk as monkeys.

CLAUDE
No, we're not drunk at all.

SHERMAN
I’ve got to get home right now.
Hazel thinks I’m still in Havre. ;

CLAUDE
Maybe you are. Maybe we’re all in
Havre. What‘s her name? .

George looks and sees a WOMAN looking out Shermari’s cabin
window.

SHERMAN ~ .
Lucy. She’s a nice girl. She’s a
Canadian.

CLAUDE

That’s probably why she likes you.
Maybe she’1ll like me.

SHERMAN

I’m going to bring her out here.
CLAUDE

Is she going to be my present from

you?

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

Sherman suddenly reaches through the window, catches .
Claude's hair in the back and twists it. Sherman is wearing
a big silver and turquoise ring that digs at Claude’s scalp.

SHERMAN
you’re not funny. You're a couple -
of clucks.

Sherman drags Claude out of the car.

SHERMAN (CONT’D)
Okay. 1/11 just break your
goddamned arm. :

Sherman speaks intently to Claude out of George’s earshot.
George looks at the motel Manager who goes back inside.
Finally, Sherman turns Claude loose and walks back to the
cabin. Claude comes and flounces into the open doorway of
the car.

CLAUDE
So. Fuck hin.

GEORGE
What’re we doing?

CLAUDE
I’m taking her off somewhere. He’s
telling her he’s going to meet her
some place later, but he isn’t. And
I'm just getting rid of her. Maybe
I‘ll kill her. That’s what Indians
are supposed to do, right? What
else is available?

Sherman emerges again, walks to the car and stuffs some
money into Claude’s shirt pocket.

SHERMAN
This is shut-up money. So shut up.
(looks in at George)
You can shut up, too, George. Go
the hell home, in fact.

Sherman motions toward the cabin door. The screen opens and
a young woman. steps out. This is Lucy. She’s wearing
sunglasses, a sundress and carrying a small suitcase. She’s
thin and of an age that could be 15 or 25, but obviously
nobody’s pushover. She comes to the car looking sullen.

SHERMAN

So, all right now. This is Claude.

She doesn’t want to go with us.

He turns immediately and starts back toward the cabin.

money on me. Be a big shot.

CLAUDE

I don’t give a shit if you’re

Lucy .
You're a real odd match for father

other.

CLAUDE
Who do I look like?

Lucy
Some Greek. Maybe your mother.

CLAUDE
Where’s she now? My mother.

Lucy
Wherever you live. At home, I
guess. You want me to guess?

CLAUDE

No. She’s dead. Are those my

Claude jumps on the motor, spewing gravel all the way out of
the parking lot and whirling off toward town.

INT. CAR - MOVING/SROADVIEW- LATE AFTERNOON

Lucy removes her sunglasses for the first time. She reaches
and turns on the radio, stares imperturbably at Claude and
George. MUSAK commences in the form of The Ray Coniff Choir
singing "April in Paris". Claude turns the radio up full
blast and drives.

EXT. BROADVIEW - PRE-DUSK

As Claude’s car makes a run through Sunburst and past the
Polar Bar, Jack is walking across Main Street, weaving very
slightly, heading toward his truck. He recognizes Claude’s
car and waves them down and comes to the window.

JACK
What’d you rob?

GEORGE
Nothing.

JACK

You robbed something. You've taken
on.a new accomplice.

GEORGE .
We're going to ride down to Great
Falls.

JACK

You're not. You’re coming home with
me. We've got some ducks to clean.

George looks at Lucy and at Claude. He wants to stay, but.

GEORGE

Okay.
Lucy

Lucy slides over to occupy George’s empty space by the
window. Claude is silent, staring ahead. :

She pulls the door closed. Claude revs the Chevy again and

heads off out of town, into the night.

on the drive home, George drives and Jack drinks out of his

own pint bottle from under the seat.

He and George both

George sits up straight and enfolds the steering wheel in
his arms. -

GEORGE

pefore I do. Or if mother is. That
worries me, that’s all.

JACK :

If I were you I’d@ worry we might

life, George. Don’t worry about
that.

(a beat)
Just stop here. Just a second.
Just stop.

George slows the truck, then stops in the road between wheat
fields. He cuts the lights and the engine. Jack rolls down
his window and puts his face out, listening.

- JACK (CONT’D)
I just want to listen now, George.
Just listen. I don’t know. You
have to do that. I like that.

Jack listens. George tries to listen without knowing what
he’s listening to. Jack is just gathering himself for
whatever’s next.

Let's go. Let’s go home the back
way.

INT. CAR - NIGHT

They drive on toward home from the alternate direction.
Sitting in the field beyond the windbreak olive trees is an
unidentified car. A Pontiac hardtop.

JACK
Well. There’s a car. Isn’t it?

They drive into the house yard. The house is a prairie
farmhouse, white-frame and dormered, with a front porch.
MAJOR, a black Labrador retriever, walks out of the Quonset
barn and stands in the headlights.

Jack opens the car door and gets out.

INT. KITCHEN ~ NIGHT 14

George and Jack enter from the mud-room steps. A tall,

young man, WOODY, who is maybe 29, stands behind the kitchen.
table. He’s dressed nicely in beige, pleated pants and a
floral shirt with the short sleeves neatly rolled, partly
disclosing a tattoo. He has wavy blond hair combed back on
the sides. Woody is a stranger and seems not intended to be
found. Woody keeps his eyes on Jack. A glass of whiskey
sits on the table. Jack looks around the kitchen...

JACK

Hello.
WOODY

Hello.
JACK

It’s me. It’s Jack.

He disappears up the stairs to confront his wife as the

is on a table beside the stairs. He seems to want to answer
it, but does not.

GEORGE

(quietly)
Let’s just go outside.

wooDY
All right.

They step toward the door.

EXT. HOUSE/CAR YARD - DARK 15

George and Woody step outside into the car yard and stand
waiting beside the house. Woody shuffles foot-to-foot. It
isn’t at all clear why he doesn’t leave while he has the
chance. Though he’s a nullity--his effect on the world is
only chaotic and his behavior random. Woody smokes a
cigarette as they stand, and it’s not possible to see that
he’s wearing cheap black and white shoes.
WOODY

I like it out here. Nothing to

bother you. I bet you could see

Chicago if the world was flat. The

Great Plains commence here.

JACK (INSIDE)
That’s a real joke! Find your :

Inside, a drawer opens and slams shut. George looks
anxiously at the house. He sees Aileen then Jack pass by
the upstairs window, arguing. Woody seems not to notice.
They hear a plane flying overhead.

WOODY
I once passed my brother in the Los
Angeles airport, you know, and
didn’t even recognize him. He
recognized me, though. Of course he
said, “Hey, bro, are you mad at me,
or what?" I wasn’t mad at him. We
both had to laugh.

George eyes Woody with both suspicion and interest. A pause
opens.

WOODY (CONT’D)
Did you know your mother was married
before?

GEORGE
Yes, I knew that.

WOODY
(smiling, knowingly)
It happens to all of them, now.
They can’t wait to get divorced.

GEORGE . .
I guess so.

Jack suddenly comes out of the house with AILEEN behind hin.
Aileen is carrying a suitcase. She is a handsome, young-
looking woman, 42 years old. She stops at the top of the
back steps, looking grave. Jack is coldly furious and looks
shaken. He walks straight up to Woody, comes close enough
for their clothing to touch. Aileen gives George a guarded
half-smile.

JACK
(softly)
What do -you do for a living?

WOODY
I’m in the Air Force.

JACK

Is this your day off, then?
WOODY

No.
JACK

What’s the matter with you? Don’t
you understand something?

Jack takes a big revolver out of his coat pocket and puts it
under Woody’s chin. Woody‘s face rises, but his arms stay
at his sides.

: JACK (CONT'D)
I don’t know what to do with you. I
don’t have any idea. I just don’t.

Jack pulls the hammer back and raises the gun higher under
Woody’s chin. For a long moment no one says a word.

AILEEN
(calmly, finally)
Jack, let’s stop now. Let’s just
stop.

Jack looks into Woody’s face, his teeth gritted together.

JACK
You're crazy, aren’t you? You’re a
goddamned crazy man. Are you in
iove with her, too? Are you? Say
you love her so I can blow your
fucking brains in the sky.

All right. No. It’s all right.

He doesn’t love me, Jack. For God’s

sake.

Jack turns and glares at Aileen, keeping the gun under
Woody’s chin.

You’re leaving! That’s why you’re
packed. Get out. Go on.

George has to be at work in the morning.

She mouths silently, but very intently to George:

AILEEN
You do what your father tells you to.

Aileen walks off the steps, rounds the corner of the house
and disappears into the ark. Woody’s car door opens and
shuts audibly. Jack returns his attention to Woody.

JACK
I’d like to think of some way to
hurt you. I feel helpless about it.
(pause)
You think I’m a fool?

: WOODY

No.
JACK

Where are you from?

wooDy
Chicago. A suburb of there.

JACK
(intensely)
Are your parents alive?

Jack pushes the gun harder under Woody’s chin.

WOODY
Yes. Yes, sir.

JACK
Toe bad they have to know what you
are. I bet they both wish you were
dead, though...Somebody else’1l have
to kill you. I don’t want to have
to think about you.
(lowers the gun)
I guess that’s it.

Jack just stands perfectly still in front of Woody, the gun
at his side. Woody says nothing. He waits an awful moment,
then steps back, looks at George, then quickly follows where
Aileen has gone. Jack looks at George helplessly.

JACK (CONT’D)
Does this seem stupid to you? All
this yelling and going nuts? I
wouldn’t blame you. You shouldn’t
even see this. I don’t know what to

It’1l be all right.
George walks out to the road. He stands, watching Woody
back the car out of the field. The car stops a moment while
Woody and Aileen sit in the car seat and have an animated
conversation George can’t hear. It is only clear they
aren’t arguing. When the car moves off, Aileen turns and
waves at him through the back window, then Woody drives away
down the road into the cold night.

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT 16

Jack has mixed himself a drink and now furiously puts
together sandwiches for the both of them. He’s on the edge
and trying to stay sane. The pistol is lying on the table.
George puts it into a kitchen drawer.

JACK
So. What do you think?

GEORGE
You could’ve been more limited,
Maybe. Maybe you shouldn’t have had
her leave.

. JACK
That’s one version. Okay. That was
a mistake. She should still be
here, I guess. This is not her
usual,

GEORGE
You could probably go find ner. We could do that.

JACK
(sarcastic)
Where would you lock?

GEORGE
I don’t know. Maybe in the café..

JACK
That’s probably exactly where she is

Shouldn’t I?

GEORGE
Sure.

Jack moves George by his shirt sleeve to the old-fashioned
high~faucet sink, turns on the hot tap, pushes George’s
hands under and begins to soap them fiercely. George
flinches from the. painful water, but his father’s hands are
in it, too, and he submits.

JACK
Harsh words are all alike, George.
You can make ‘em up. They all mean
the same thing.

- GEORGE
What’s that?

JACK

Jack quits washing George’s hands, wipes his own on his
pants.

night. They each seem bored with the other. Lucy looks at
George curiously. Claude immediately heads for the back

Oh, we had a wonderful time. You

has a small bar of motel soap in her palm and uses it
sparingly.

She continues dipping water onto herself as though to taunt
him with herself. Down the bank, Claude finds something he
likes for bait, rigs up a hook and casts his line into a
slow-moving eddy. He is skillful and seems confident of
catching a fish.

Lucy finishes her bath, walks out of the water and kneels in front of her
suitcase, realizing a tiny bit of modesty. She puts on a long flannel shirt,
a men's size. She stands and walks up the grass bank to where George sits.

Lucy :
I want to get in the sunlight. It's warmer up here.
I think I'1l have a warm beer.
She takes a beer out of the six-pack and sits on the grass beside him. On
the RADIO a weather forecast for central Wyoming is audible. Rain is forecast.

Lucy is clearly moved by George's admission, and sympathetic to his
predicament. She pulls closer to him, looking up, but at a loss for how
to sympathize correctly. She takes off her sunglasses and looks up at George.

George looks down at Claude, who's dragging a big whitefish up onto the bank.

and subsiding in the grass.

Isn't it lively? It’s a whitefish.
They’re good to eat.

Lucy
What a surprise that must be for: the fish.
Everything just goes crazy at once. I wonder what it

CLAUDE
Fish don’t think.

He kneels beside the fish, holding a long clasp knife, and
tries to take the hock out with a deft turn of his knife
blade, but in doing it he causes the fish to twist in his
grasp and the knife to jab his palm. He drops the knife,
wrings his hand, then sucks the cut.

CLAUDE (CONT’D)

her and it is a moment of fierce tension.

confidently pushes the knife--not without resistance-—

straight through the fish’s side, behind the gills. The
fish maxes a noise in its throat. Lucy then raises the
whole contraption-~knife and fish together--and slings it

Lucy falls into exhausted sleep. George watches her sleep
for a long moment, then gets up, restless, gazes out the
door, then goes to find a phone book in a drawer and looks
up a number. Silently he decides not to call for fear of
waking Lucy. But he takes the book, opened to the Casper
city map, and quietly slips out of the room.

EXT. MOTEL - DAY 38

As George walks out and closes the door quietly, he sees a
large MAN in his fifties wearing rough ranch clothing, get
out of a pickup and walk to the pay phone next to George’s
car. The Man takes a piece of paper from his pocket and
reaches for the phone. He turns and looks aggressively at
George as George passes. George, unsettled, looks away and
speeds his walk.
MAN
Hey!

George doesn’t respond, reaches his car and opens the door.

MAN
(insistent)
Hey. What‘re you up to?

GEORGE
(finally)
I’m minding my own business. Is
that safe here?

GEORGE
No.
MAN

You'd of fooled me. You sure you
don’t want a job? I got a job.

GEORGE
Yeah. Sure.

MAN
‘Bye.

The man begins to make a call. George drives away.

39 INT./EXT. DRIVE THROUGH CASPER ~ DAY 39

George uses the telephone-book map and drives into his
aunt’s neighborhood, which is in town, to a middie-class row
house with a fenced-in half-acre lot. Sudy’s house has a
wheelchair ramp up to the front porch. George parks and
goes to the door.

40 EXT. JUDY AND HARLEY’S HOUSE - DAY ~ 40

JUDY opens the front door smiling, not recognizing George.
She is near Aileen’s age but pretty and appealing in a
somewhat more wholesome way-

JUDY
Hi, there.

GEORGE
(hesitantly)
Hi, Judy. It’s George. Aileen’s
son. I kinda thought I’d come by.

JUDY
(loudly, affectionately)
Oh-Jesus-Christ~it-is-not! You’re a

INT. JUDY AND HARLEY’S LIVING ROOM ~ DAY 41

Here it’s antiseptically neat--a couch, matched chairs, a _
preserved old TV--but un-lived in. Judy and Harley “live in
the back" of the house where Judy takes George.

INT. DEN/KITCHEN - DAY

Here is a sunny, remodeled kitchen and an opened-up, added-
on den with a wheelchair ramp for HARLEY, SJudy’s husband,
who’s black, handsome and trapped in a wheelchair, which is
pushed up to a kitchen table set for lunch. Judy and Harley
seem a more dependable, more affectionate couple than
George’s parents.

JUDY

(entering)
Now, Harley, I don’t want you to get
up out of your wheelchair or
anything but who do you think this
is? It’s George. Remember George?
My sister's only baby? Well, this
is what he’s turned out to be, right
here!

Judy pushes George toward Harley, who smiles crazily and
gives him a fierce black-power handshake up from his chair.

HARLEY
All riiight! How you doin’? You’re
up there, aren’t you? You’re way up
there. Up in the clouds.

Harley fidgets his fingers on the padded arms of ‘his
wheelchair.

JUDY |

(busily setting a place)
We're just about to have lunch. T
want you to sit down and eat with

us.

HARLEY

Harley lurches off toward a smal] hideaway room off the
kitchen. He opens the door and pushes in, George behind
him.

INT. GUN ROOM - DAY

HARLEY
(chuckling, entering)
All right. Come in here.

Harley switches on the fluorescent lights in the ceiling.
The room contains a huge TV, cheap wood-panelled walls and
two walls full ef guns in racks. Harley is a gun nut.
Military rifles, hunting rifles with scopes, a machine gun,
sawed-offs with pistol grips,“ pistols of all kinds
displayed. Harley wheels straight over to the wall and
takes down the one particularly malevolent-looking scoped
rifle he can reach unaided. He mounts it--still seated--and
makes several severe popping noises.

HARLEY (CONT’D)

Starlight. Light you up after dark.

George looks at Harley, then at the gun. Harley cuts his
eyes at George, smiling.

HARLEY (CONT‘D)
I’m a civil engineer. Did you know
that? .

GEORGE
I knew that. We met once.

HARLEY
Did we? I don’t remember.. I met
suay right down on Wyoming Street in
town. Two days after I got out of
the U.S. Army. I came out here to
get rich...You know what you can do

HARLEY
Why not! They put me in this chair.
How do you think I got in this
chair? I’m standing down underneath
the rig and somebody opened up his
Junch bucket and dropped an orange
straight down on my head. Broke me
all up to pieces. And one of these
days they’re going to come up here
to finish the job and that’s when
I’ll be sitting here waiting with my

GEORGE :
Do you think they’l1 come up here?
Right to your house? I don’t see

a loss. Somebody has to pay for

what they never ever do? They never

Harley disappears into the room and slams the door behind
him. The TV comes on then, LOUD through the walls.” "Wheel

Judy and George walk out to the car. Judy is sympathetic
and affectionate.

JUDY
Was she by herself? She’s my

She wasn’t. Dad made her leave,

JUDY
Not always, hon. That’s right.

Lucy sits on the bed, talking to Johnny on the phone. She
looks toward George, disguising her surprise and relief.

Let’s go drink something. I'm tired
of talking to myself.

EXT. TRAILS END BAR - NIGHT 48

The Trails is a long, wood-sided roadhouse, with cars parked -
in a gravel lot.

INT. TRAILS END BAR - NIGHT 49

Lucy and George sit at a table drinking beer. The Trails
End is a cowboy-and-roughneck bar with poker and keno tables
popping, people dancing and in the large back room a
pitiful, small-time "Tough-Guy Contest," using a crude fight
ring, shallow makeshift ceiling lights and a sparse, drunk
crowd in attendance--vaguely interested COWBOYS, INDIANS and
their GIRLFRIENDS. Two INDIAN BOYS spar but no one in the
audience pays much attention; some are booing and taunting
the boxers. The Indians are bloodying each other almost
without effort.

George is remotely cocky. Lucy is half-drunk and ill-
tempered from the strain of the previous days and from her
responsibilities. i

GEORGE
How do you think you can get
somebody out of jail?

Lucy
I’ve got a plan to do it.

GEORGE
Let’s hear about it.

Lucy
Let me just say this as true. The
way to get out of trouble is find
somebody with worse trouble and get
them to help you.

GEORGE
That isn’t true about women.

What’s true about women in the words

woman who’s got worse troubles than
you do.

Lucy
Asshole-heart. What’re you doing
away from home, anyway?

You know he’s underage. Shit.

She turns away in her chair, disgusted.

LUCY (CONT’D)
I hope you don’t mind if I went down
on your friend. Clark, or Klaus.
Whatever. I just had too many
troubles to help myself. You know?

GEORGE
(ill-at-ease)
Whatever floats your boat.

Lucy
Well, that floated mine, and it
floated his right to the top. I
guarantee you.

A BARMAID passes through the tables handing out challenge
cards by which a customer can enter his name to fight the
bar champ in the ring at the back, win a hundred dollars and
become the "Tough Guy."

BARMAID
(blandly)
You wanna fight?
George glances at the card, shakes his head no.

Lucy
No. I’m sure you don’t.

Lucy slides the card across the table in front of her. To
the cowboy at the next table she says:

George what?
(staring at him)
George. ..No-lead-in-his-pencil.
We’ll make you an Indian again.

She writes this and slides the card back to George.
LUCY (CONT’D)
You couldn’t pour piss out of a
boot. You poor thing.

GEORGE
Is that right?

_George takes the card, looks at it.

Lucy
Maybe you can win a hundred dollars
and get out of my life.

: GEORGE
' It won't cost me that much.

He crumples the card she gave him, takes another card from
the several on the table and walks to the back of the bar.

INT. BOXING RING ROOM/TRAILS END - NIGHT . 50

A man is’ seated ringside at a wooden table on top of which
is a bell and a piece of metal for sounding rounds. George
steps up hesitantly, puts down the card, signs it right
there, then stands nearby waiting to fight the INDIAN, who
is a lean, rangy boy who sits ringside wearing no shirt,
@rinking a beer. George takes his shirt off but not his
boots.

INT. BOXING RING ~- NIGHT 51

who’s barefoot and an assassin. George uses the ring skills

George around, finally knocking him down and kicking him.

INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Lucy lies languorously on the bed, indifferent to George,
who's standing in the bathroom after his shower, pouring ice
from an ice bucket onto a wash rag then putting the rag on
his swollen cheeks. Lucy offers no sympathy. George
notices Lucy watching.

GEORGE
When did watching me get to be so
interesting?

Lucy
I wasn’t watching you. I was
looking at you and thinking about
something else. People must do that —
to you a lot.

GEORGE

I got my ass kicked. I don’t like
that. i

Lucy
I was just thinking about that.
That’s what my mother is. A kick-
ass. Isn’t that funny?

GEORGE
No.

Lucy

That’s because you don’t think it’s

Lucy and George walk to a bank of lockers, open one. Lucy
produces an envelope full of bills. She and George huddle
against the locker in a pitiful attempt at secrecy. She
counts half the bills into George’s hands, then pauses.

Lucy
Maybe I just oughta give it all to
‘em right away. He might have a
hard time getting into it and get
pissed off.

GEORGE
Go with the deal. He gets the

He takes the money, puts it in another envelope they’ve

the key.

Lucy lies across the top of him, drinks the beer with her
mouth close to his, pushes her fingers through his hair,gets
beer on his face. Until now she has been observing a small
code of conduct with regard to George-~some innocence in hin

consolation.

Lucy hurriedly puts on her coat.

George leans to pick up a plank board and as he hauls it up,
half rises then swings it flagrantly at Art, who
instinctively shoots the rotted plank half off and in a
second motion, bashes George in the face with the barrel,
then spontaneously does the same to Lucy as she tries to

wrists so that they can’t escape. She then moves the cuff
around on Lucy’s wrist, who's shuddering now from the onset

reservation police car on a night patrol. When the car
nears the oil rig, it stops. A POLICEMAN runs his
flashlight across the well platform, disclosing Lucy and
George, who seem asleep where they’ve been handcuffed and
are covered with dirt and frost. When they reach George one
of the Indian policemen squats, brushes frost off George's
face.

POLICEMAN
What are you two doing here?

He shakes George, who wakes to the light in his face and the
faraway sound of the Indian’s voice. Lucy remains still
beneath him, almost unnoticeable. The policeman holds his
finger to Lucy’s neck, but there’s no pulse.

POLICEMAN
{to his partner)
Not this one.

GEORGE
(faint, desperate)
I have the right key. She made a
mistake. You can have it now.

In an instant, George recollects himself, tries to lift
himself off Lucy, turns his face to hers and sees she’s died
of shock and concussion during the night.

DISSOLVE TO:
INT. CASPER SHERIFF’S OFFICE - MORNING

It is several days later. George, his face bruised, sits
beside an empty detective’s desk in a large room Where 3
other sheriff’s detectives are working at their desks,
talking on phones. They ignore him. A fourth DETECTIVE
casually enters from another office carrying a metal
container, which he sets on his desk and from which he
produces George’s wallet, some change, a clasp knife and the
locker key from the Greyhound depot.

George picks up his belongings with his bandaged hand and
stuffs them in his pockets.

She called from down in Rock

particulars. She wanted me to wire
her some money. Which I did. But
of course I told her about you. And
she said she wanted to see you, said
she’d take the bus up here. She’s

Aileen is in stocking feet, wearing blue jeans, her hair
tied back as though it was dirty. She turns in the middle
of the small room and smiles at him. Her suitcase is open
on the floor beside the bed. Some folded clothes are on the
unmade covers. She is packing and unrepentant but wishes,
if possible, still to be his mother.

GEORGE

INT. GREYHOUND TERMINAL - MONTAGE - DAY 88

George takes a seat to begin his 3-hour wait for the bus
home. The effects of the last few days have settled on him
and he is abstracted and undirected. He unwraps the bandage
on his hand and exercises his fingers painfully. He throws
the bandage away.

He’s incapable of relaxing or sitting still and begins to
wander around the bus station. As he does, time seems to
fracture. He passes people randomly, overhearing
conversations, becoming indistinguishable within the
populated depot.

OVERHEARD
I went out there in the night where
he was changing his shirt.

OVERHEARD ~
I wondered if the FBI would be
calling my house.

He stares at soldiers and Indians, farmers, old men and
backpackers, fixating on an idle gesture or on someone‘’s
shoes. He’s becoming more abstracted.

OVERHEARD
I thought he wanted me, you know.
But when he started he just lost his
heart.

He plays pinball.- He goes into the little diner, drinks a «
Coke and watches the fry-cook. For brief moments time seems
to slow down, the sounds blurring.

Two girls, early twenties, stand in front of an open locker.
One vaguely resembles Lucy, changes her blouse while the
other girl shields her. George watches, transfixed,
standing against a column. He is remembering Lucy.

A man walks past where George is standing. He is a large,
pulky man in his fifties, wearing extremely handsome western
clothes: snake-skin boots, whipcord trousers, a silver
rodeo buckle belt, white shirt and hat and a fleece-lined
denim jacket. He is carrying a hard-sided attache case and
a wrapped package, which he delivers to the ticket counter
for express service. It is the man George had seen making a
call outside the Eden Isle motel days before. The man has

quickly, without speaking, flashes an ungainly left hand--
open fist--and hits George across the other cheek, knocking
him further down. George scrambles up, his eyes narrowed,
gasping for breath. Again the man very quickly and
methodically moves in, but George slides off to the left and
when the man swings his flat hand, George is angled beside
him and hits him 4 times in the face--in combinations~-using
his painful, injured hand, and knocks the man against the
unlatched stall doors causing him to lose his balance and fall inside. As with the
fight against the Indian boy earlier, this is a sudden,
vicious, unmerciful fight.
