paint is blistering and peeling off the metal, the
metal itself dissolving and dribbling over the windows
in a hideous, molten mess.

Hydrochloric acid has been poured over the entire car,,
giving off a sinister, HISSING STEAM as it performs its ~
lethal work. This is the work of a sick mind, no less
disturbing for being directed against an inanimate
object.

Can't find it.

She searches the small drawers on top of his desk.

She pushes his papers around, moves the tape player and
the typewriter...

Desperately. Seth slumps into the desk chair. She
pulis the large desk drawer open -- and finds the
address book lying on top.

She starts looking up Arthur’s number. Finally finds
it. She ignores the tape cassette which is tucked in
the front. of the book.

She pulis the phone over, dials, and waits, Herc hand
absentmindedly plays with the tape cassette which was
in the book.

Arthur... Oh God... Pick up the

She look at the cassette in her hand, and sees that it
teads “PLAY ME.” She reacts and slips it into the tape
deck, Pushing PLAY.

For a moment, nothing is heard. Beth realizes the
problem and yanks out the earphone extension cord.

Instantly Alex's voice, very slurred, comes out of the

Alex, more or less where we left off; Alex's mercurial
mood on the tape has shifted again; possibly we hear a
