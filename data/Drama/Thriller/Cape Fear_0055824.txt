EXT. SQUARE IN SOUTHERN TOWN - Day

4n old picturesque square. Many trees cast shadows over the
low buildings. Traffic slowly threads its way along the street.

It's summer, and the majority of people are in light dresses or
shirt sleeves.

Gradually we become aware of a MAN walking towards us. He is
large, immensely pawerful, wears.a gaudy sport shirt, and chews
the stub of a cigar. This is MAX CADY.

He comes into CLOSE SHOT and CAMERA PANS with him. Now, in the.

not too far distance, we SEE the COURTHOUSE. It is an imposing
and majestic building and Cady is walking deliberately ‘towards it

glances upwards « CAMERA follows his gaze and tilts upward.
We'now SEE the fine old circular stairwell of the Courthouse,
and the domed ceiling.

MED. CLOSE SHOT - CADY

PAN with him as he walks forward, and starts up the staircase.

A middle-aged LIBRARIAN, carrying an armful of law books, is
walking down the stairs. The top book falls to the floor just
as.Cady reaches her. The woman rather obviously expects him to
pick up the bock - a grateful smile is already on her lips «
but he ignores her and continues past. She stands helplessly,
not knowing whether’ to try to tend down and pick up the book,
whether to put all the books down and start over again, or what.

him as he reaches the first floor landing.

SHOOTING DOWN FROM TOP LANDING

The circular stairwell and landing are below us. In LONG SHOT

we SEE the lone figure of Cady (on the first floor landing),
as he wanders around + looking for something.

INT, COURTHOUSE - FIRST FLOOR LANDING

‘This flcor has a quaint dignity. There are doors to offices

and courtrooms. The courtrcoms are lettered, and bear the
names of presiding Judges. In the BACKGROUND of our SHOT we
SEE Cady looking around, chewing his cigar. In the foreground
a NEGRO JANITOR is slowly shuffling ty. Cady spies him, and
calls acrcss the circular stairwell to him.

Hey, know where a lawyer named Sam
Bowden hangs out?

@ gaunt, middle-aged man, sitting somewhat awkwardly, his hands
crossed upon a cane, Nearby is DR, PEARSALL, an old man but

with an alert, competent look. Counsel for the Defense is WALTER
VERNON, Beside him is a representative of the Gibraltar
Insurance Company.

SAM
(to Judge)
If your Honor please. may I ask on
behalf of the plaintiff that the
defense's motion for an indefinite
adjournment be denied?

JUDGE
Do you question that an important
witness is actually 111 in hospital
as stated by the defense?

SAM
No, your Honor, but this weuld make
the third adjournment of this case --
always due to the illness of some
defense witness. Granted that this
witness is i111, the defense still
has eleven important witnesses able
to testify, while the plaintiff has
but one. I submit that eleven against
one should be enough, no matter how

happen to be,

INT. CAR - MED. SHOT

Sam tosses his brief case on the seat, starts the engine,
abstractedly reaches for a cigarette and then the lighter.
At that moment a brawny arm reaches through the window on the
driver's side, switches off the ignition, pulls out the key.
Sam, caught with the lighter in his hand and taken completely
by surprise, finds himself staring into Max Cady's smiling
face.

CADY
Hello, Counsellor. Remember me?

Still startled, it takes Sam a long moment to bring his
thoughts into focus.

CADY :
Baltimore. Eight years, four months,
thirteen days ago. Is it coming in

Didn't remember me right off, did

bit. Where Itve been, if you don't
change, they're real disappointed.
But you haven't changed, Counsellor.
Know something? That's the way I
wanted it. I wanted you to be just
the way I last saw you.

SAM
All right, you've seen me. What's
the rest?

CADY

Just want to give you the word, that's
all, want to make sure you see the
picture. Simple as that, Counsellor.

Though Sam can sense the threat, the words themselves are
puzzling. But he keeps his voice firm.

SAM
Give me my keys.

EXT. THE BOWDEN HOUSE AND DRIVEWAY - AFTERNOON

The place is on the outskirts, almost in the country. It isa
remodeled farmnouse, neat and unpretentious, sitting well back
from the street with no other house within a hundred yards. As
Sam drives in his daughter, NANCY, 12, is sitting waiting on
the porch steps, dressed in slacks; and there are three bowling
ball bags beside her, Shoes are tied to the bags by their
strings. She rises from the steps with an accusing look at Sem
as he gets out of the car. Marilyn, the Trish setter, rushes
from the steps and gives him a wildly affectionate greeting as
ANGLE WIDENS.

NANCY

toward station wagon)

SAM
(grins)
It's a mistake to teach women how
to tell time. They always use it

against you.

He turns as his wife, PEGGY, COMES from the house. She, too,
is dressed in slacks -- and very attractively. She is always
a signt to light up Sam's eyes. He moves halfway up the porch
steps to meet her.

SAM
Wherets your stop watch?

PEGGY
(grins)
Mine starts ticking the minute you
leave the house.

He smiles, takes her in his arms and gives her a good, solid
kiss, then holds her for a minute.

. SAM
What is there about you I can't
resist?
NANCY

Come on, Dad; you can do that on
your own time. I asked Betty to

Peggy laughs and CAMERA PANS with her as she steps up to take
her turn.

INT. REFRESHMENT AREA

This area, which serves beer, cokes, etc., is to the rear of
the alleys, and from some of the small tables the alleys can
be seen. Max Cady sits down at a table where he can watch
the Bowden family. He now has a sack of peanuts,

CADY
(to WAITRESS )
Beer.

She nods and hurries AWAY. His eyes linger on her trim figure,
then return to the alleys. Slowly he crushes another peanut
shell, crunches the two nuts between his teeth. The Waitress
RETURNS with open beer bottle and glass on a tray.

CADY
Fast on your feet, aren't you?

WAITRESS
You have to be around here.

He takes her left nand as she sets down the tray, examines the
wedding ring.

: CADY
That ring mean anything?

The waitress has tensed, but easily pulls her hand away.

WAITRESS
Plenty.

Cady puts a twenty-dollar bill on the table.

CADY
That mean anything?

She starts to turn away. He puts down another twenty. For an
instant she hesitates. He smiles, picks up both bilis, having
proved to his own satisfaction that all women can be had. She
hurries AWAY, faster this time, but Cady no longer looks after
her. He takes a swallow of beer, eyes on the Bowden family,
then gets up, glass in hand.

He is bowling for a spare; then, as he waits for his ball, he
turns to chalk his hands and is just starting to pick up the
ball when he sees Cady move to the rail in b.g. Sam stands
for a moment, in shocked surprise, then turns and makes his
delivery. The ball goes wide of the single pin.

NANCY
Dad, youire slipping.

He makes a slight deprecatory gesture but no reply as he resumes

his seat. Nancy steps into position, tries to find her ball.

PEGGY AND SAM
He marks down his score.

. PEGGY
You are slipping. Usually you would
have said the pin moved.

SAM

It did.

Max Cady, beer in hand, APPEARS in the b.g., walking benind
the rail. His syes are on Nancy getting ready to bowl o.s.

Cady is now nearly back to CAMERA and Nancy is in ANGLE as

she makes her delivery. Cady leans over and taps Sam on the
shoulder. Surprised, Sem turns into CAMERA, his back to Nancy
as her ball scatters the pins ~ the last one teeters and
finally falls. Nancy leaps for jcy. But Sam Bowden is aware
of none of this. He rises to his feet.

Now that's just the advice I wanted,

I'd suggest you check with the escrow
officer of the First National Bank -

that money came from, Captain.

SAM
I tell you I've got this worked out!
There's a houseboat up near Cape Fear,
with a little shore cabin -- @ tele-
phone.., but it's isolated and hard
to find. It's a perfectly plausible
place for me to hide my family --

DUTTON
No place is plausible. Do you expect
Cady to believe you'd leave your
family alone anywhere?

SAM
That's the one thing that had me
stopped. But this morning Grafton
handed me'the perfect answer right on
a platter. He's forcing me to fly up
to Atlanta to appear before the Ethics
Committee... and you can bet that his
friend Mr. Cady will be tailing me
clear to the airport. Oh, I'il make
my appearance, all right -- and then
I'll hire a car and cut across to the
coast -- that's eighty-five miles --
and hire a boat at Hennessey's Land-~

there was no law, And there's no

THROUGH BINOCULARS - THE CABIN WINDOW

In the cabin we can see Nancy -~ listening to the gramophone,
and bouncing @ ping-pong ball in time with the record.

CADY

lowers the binoculars and whisks away a mosquito. The tune from
the record player drifts across the water. Cady starts taking
off his shoes.

EXT. AREA NEAR CASIN ~ NIGHT

With the MUSIC quite loud in his ears, Sam is well concealed in ¢
clump of high grass and bushes near the cabin. He, too, is
bothered by mosquitoes but slaps at them very quietly. He is
very much “on the alert" - suddenly he hears a SOUND from the
cabin and turns sharply.

Nancy has dropped the ping-pong ball and it is bouncing ané
clattering up against the wall and some tins. As Nancy retrieves

Nancy is now seated by the telephone, again nervously bouncin
the ping-pong ball in time with the record. From time to time
she cannot keep from looking around.

EXT. RIVER - NIGHT

Scarcely making a ripple, and almost completely submerged and
hidden by tall grass and cypress trees in the water, Cady is
swimming toward the landing, MUSIC COMING OVER. The record is
worn, begins to REPEAT. Then, as he nears the pier, the record
abruptly comes to an END. Cady HEARS a faint SLAPPING SOUND from
the base of the pler. He treads water in order to hear better.

EXT. SPACE UNDER PIER

Kersek slaps another mosquito, scoops up mud from the waterts
edge, smears it over his face and neck as protection. Then he
applies more to his forearms and the backs of his hands, another
record beginning to PLAY. He doesn't see the hand that APFEARS
from the shadows behind him, claps over his mouth while simulta-
neously another hand grips one of his forearms, twists it behing
his back. Now Max Cady's huge torso can be seen as Kersek
begins to struggle. Cady twists the imprisoned arm excruciai-
ingly. An expert wrestler and infinitely stronger than Kersek,
Cady turns his victim over without taking his hand from his
mouth. The record continues to PLAY. Only now does Cady's
intent become clear. With Kersek belly down, arm twisted be-
hind him, Cady smothers the threshing legs with his own, then
forces Kersek's face into the water, quickly snatches the hand
from his mouth, uses it to keep Kersek's head down.
cADY .
(fierce whisper)

You're gonna drown boy -- without

a mark on you. You were too smart

for your pants,
Kersek's struggles are beginning to weaken. Now Cady begins to
inch him farther into the water, With Kersek's head and torso
submerged, he waits to make sure all struggles have ceased.
Then he pushes him all the way in. The body sinks soundlessly.
Cady moves QUT.

INT. HOUSEBOAT MAIN CABIN - NIGHT

Nearly numb with terror, Peggy is confronting Max Cady, standing
just inside the door, wet trousers clinging to his powerful
thighs, the mocking smile on his lips.

CADY
Come on, now, you can't be that
scared, When you get right down to
it, what's there to be afraid of?

He half-turns to lock the door. As if propelled by springs,
she darts toward the locker where she keeps the gun. But Cady
has been waiting for this; he glides with amazing swiftness to
get there ahead of her, takes out the .38.

. CADY
Well, what do you know? Me, if I
had a gun I'd get thrown right back
in stir,

He throws the gun out through the port-hole, then looks toward

_the bedroom door. Suddenly his hand reaches out, grips ner
“upper arm so tight that she gasps.’ At last she manages to

speak,

PEGGY

he shoves her another step or two toward the bedroom door,

CADY
And you a lawyer's wife! Donitt you

be any charge against me?

Suddenly Peggy lashes out and gives him a terrific crack across
the face with her free hand. Cady doesn't seem to feel it. He
quickly pins her other arm and pushes her through the door.

As for blackmail, you just think I

She tries to cower back as she realizes that he is closing the

she HEARS the CLICK of the lock.

CAMERA TRACKS with Cady as (poker clutched in his hand), he
stalks Sam. The angle is such that we are aware that Cady has
spotted Sam - but that Sam himself is unaware of Cady's silent
approach. Just when it seems that Cady is going to kill Sam --
Sam glimpses the raised poker, and scrambles to his feet.

darts aside through some trees. Cady following him. Now Cady
suddenly jumps to one side, and for an instant it looks as
though Sam is trapped against the trunk of a tree. . Cady ad-

By a hair's breadth Sam contrives to move aside. The poker
whistles through the air and cuts through the bark of the tree

conceals himself in the long grass. Savagely, Cady thrashes
at the undergrowth. Each blow makes a dull and sickening thud.
One savage stroke comes near to hitting Sem -- and he has to
move aside and give himself away. Cady leaps towards him, and
Sam -- pressed against the far bank of the gully -- seems to
be at his mercy.

Cady “savours" this for a brief moment, then raises the poker
for the "kill." In the same instant there is a TERRIFIED SCREAM

PEGGY

her hair drenched, and her wet dress clinging to her body --

has struggled ashore. Though near complete exhaustion she

moves toward Cady. This "interruption" gives Sam the chance

to roll aside -- and again Cady goes berserk -- thrashing at

the ground, each and every stroke could be the death of Sam.

In terror =-- not knowing what she is doing -= Peggy runs forward.
Cady is momentarily distracted.

SAM

This gives Sam the chance he has been waiting for. Ina last
desperate gamble, he scrambles forward towards the revolver.
Cady comes after him. Sam gropes for the gun -- and just as
Cady is about to hit him, Sam gets the revolver and twists
around and fires.

CADY

is already delivering Sam's "death blow" -- as he is hit by the
bullet from the revolver, the poker spins from his hand, and
Cady reels aside clutching his shoulder. He looks surprised
and stunned.
