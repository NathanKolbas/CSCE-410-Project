"NORMA RAE"
FADE IN
UNDER TITLES:
SERIES OF PHOTOGRAPHS 1

They succeed one another with the SOUND of a CAMERA CLICKING
sharply.

This is a composite of NORMA RAE WEBSTER's life, glimpses
of her early days, a burgeoning and a metamorphosis:

She is seen as an infant, sitting in her bath ina
galvanized tub, hair twisted into a kewpie-doll peak,
beribboned.

Norma at seven, front tooth out, a large grin splitting her
face.

At twelve in a bathing suit, a pigeon-toed stance, arms
folded self-consciously across her chest.

At fifteen, facing front, arrogant now, breasts jutting out,
hip cocked.

At eighteen, her arm around a sailor's shoulder, wearing
his hat at a rakish angle.

At twenty on a front porch with a cluster of girls, Norma
at the center, mouth black with too much lipstick, holding
a ukulele.

At twenty-two, holding a bridal bouquet, wearing a floppy
hat, perplexed, faintly forlorn, on the edge of the unknown.

At twenty-four, defiant, thumbing her nose at a sign reading
"Simpson's Secretarial School."

At twenty-six, sitting with her back against a tree, twe
young children tumbled in her lap, looking fond and frazzled.

At twenty-eight, in a monkey-pert waitress!’ outfit,
balancing a tray, ground lost.

At thirty, a photographer's formal portrait, unguarded,
beautiful, unfathomable.

At thirty-two, mature, strong, with humor, without illusion. i

She moves -- and the photograph becomes film.

CAMERA PULLS BACK. In the noise, amid the flying lint,
OQ she is in an aisle tight with machines, monitoring looms.

THE MILL 3

The place bursts on the SCREEN like a battlefield, full of

a jolting, nerve-shattering din. In the enormous space,

rows and rows of old WOODEN LOOMS ROAR like waterfalls and

shake the floors with ceaseless trembling vibrations. The

sound is deafening, the constant punishing, racketing motion

disorienting. There are no windows, no sunlight, only

blank, brick walls; it is a seasonless, timeless world in |

which men and women cannot hear themselves think, do not i

think. They are bound and shackled to the work.
I

Steam vents spew mist into every corner to keep the yarn
hot and wet. Mosquito netting rises from the floor and
disappears overhead in the high dark reaches toward the
ceiling. There is a permanent haze everywhere made by lint
coming off the rolls of terry cloth, rolls as high as a man.

ANOTHER ANGLE 4

The work begins in "the raw" where the cotton bales are

brought in and men with surgical masks covering their noses

and mouths rip apart the bales of cotton, feeding them into
1 the mouths of hoppers that shred the cotton fibers and rip

So them apart.

Cotton dust and lint fill the air like snow, coating
everyone from head to toe.

ANOTHER ANGLE | 5

Carders are next on the line, then spinners and doffers.
Almost all the work can be seen in this vast room, the size
of an enormous pasture, without interior walls. The rolls
of terry cloth slowly unwind behind the backs of the side
henmers » passing yard by yard through the women's sewing
machines.

LEONA WITCHARD 6
grey-streaked, traces of beauty still visible. She works
with her face close to a spider web of threads, her hands
rapidly guiding them. It is work of intense concentration,
demanding, exhausting.

VERNON WITCHARD . 7

A shrill WHISTLE SOUNDS. It is the break for lunch.

Vernon Witchard straightens, clutching his back, punished
by the morning's work.

INT, LUNCHROOM 8

A narrow space with a long window looking out on the work
floor. Signs are posted: "Give your chair to a spinner;
they only have 15 minutes." The mill hands make quick work
of their meal. There is little conversation; they are
already too tired to talk.

Norma munches on an apple. BONNIE MAE, a cheerful sparrow
of a woman from the folding tables, speaks to her.

BONNIE MAE
You just eating an apple for
lunch?

NORMA
I'm dieting.

BONNIE MAE

Well, I gotta keep my strength
up.

(eats heartily,

biting into a thick

sandwich)
I put this jelly up myself. on
Sunday, Roscoe and I put up over
sixty quarts of peaches. What'd
you do over the weekend, Norma?

NORMA
Soaked my feet.

BONNIE MAE
Saw you downtown. Your friend
drives a big car.

NORMA
If you'd looked on the motel
register, you'd a seen my name
there, too.

BONNIE MAE
It's none of my business...

Norma turns to look at her mother beside her. The woman's
eyes are closed, her head rests back against the tile.

NORMA
Momma, you haven't opened your
sack.

Leona remains motionless.
NORMA
Momma, don't you want your
lunch?
Still the woman doesn't answer.

NORMA
Momma !

Still Leona remains with her eyes closed. Alarmed, Norma
shakes her and Leona finally opens her eyes, looking at her
daughter blankly.

NORMA
What is it, Momma? Don't you
feel good?

LEONA
What?

NORMA

Don't you hear me? Momma!
(bends close to
her, bawling)

Momma, Momma, Momma!

Leona doesn't respond. Norma is on her feet instantly. She
hauls her mother up, grabs her by the arm, and, pulling
after her, she runs.

THE WEAVING ROOM 9

It is a headlong race across the length of the mill, Norma
ahead and frantic, her mother in tow.

INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE 10

DR. WATSON is confronted by an agitated, flaring Norma,
while Leona sits with her hands calmly folded in her lap.

NORMA
She didn't hear me} She didn't
hear one word I said! She doesn't
hear you now!

DR. WATSON
You know this happens, Norma Rae.
It happens all the time.

NORMA
That makes it all right, huh?
She's only deaf for an hour,
she's only deaf for two hours,
she's only deaf all day!

DR. WATSON
(mildly)
She can get herseif another job.

NORMA
What other job in this town?
"his is the only job.

DR. WATSON
I'll give her a note. They'll
send her home.

NO
(bitterly)
Come on, Momma. You're nothing
to any of 'em.

She takes her mother's arm and shepherds her out.
EXT, THE YARD OF THE WITCHARD HOUSE 11

The back of the shotgun house sits in an almost grassless
plot. In one corner of the yard a shade tree struggles to
live. It is still daylight, and underneath, on a straight-
backed kitchen chair, Leona Witchard sits quietly. She
sits very still, her face tilted toward the meager green
above her; she is in a reverie, on the wings of a dream.

INT. KITCHEN : 12
Norma is at the sink, washing the dishes, her father Vernon,
towel in hand, dries. Norma, as she works, watches her
mother through the open window. She finally calls out to
her.

NORMA
You all right out there?

Without turning, Leona responds in her quiet, patient voice.

LEONA
OQ Yes. I'm all right.
NORMA
You'll get all bitten up.
LEONA

I'm coming in soon.
Norma returns to the job at hand. She suddenly wipes her
hands briskly on a towel.

NORMA
I'm gonna let this pot soak.
RNON
(mildly)
There's one soaking from
breakfast.

NORMA
Well, now it's got company.

She goes out.

INT, LIVING ROOM / 13
SG In the sparsely furnished room, two children, CRAIG and
MILLIE, sit raptly watching TELEVISION. Norma enters.

NORMA
Ten more minutes of that junk
and then you.do your homework.

CRAIG
I did it.

NORMA
'¢' in writing, 'C’ in spelling,
'D! in reading -~ you haven't
peen doing too much homework.

MILLIE
Sssshhh. I wanna hear.

NORMA
I'll ssshhh you.

She goes into her bedroom, strips off her blouse, sniffs
! the armpits, grimaces and tosses it aside. She takes one
from the closet and puts it on.

NORMA
I'm going into town.
VERNON
What do you need in town?
NORMA
Things.
VERNON
Well...I'll drive you in.
NORMA

NORMA

I'm going to J.C. Penney's to

white cotton brassiere, size 32C.
You wanna come sit on a little
stool outside the dressing room
and have all the ladies look at

THE FRONT DOOR 15
REUBEN WARSHOVSKY stands on the stoop.

He has two large suitcases and is dressed in tennis shoes,
blue jeans and a T-shirt. Reuben is lean, sharp, full of
nervous and intellectual energy; his view of life wavers
between the jaundiced and the merry. He is a master of
finagle and accommodation; he is purposeful and principled.
He is fully mobilized always, however calm and easy his
manner may be.

REUBEN
Mr. Witchard?

VERNON
That's right. Vernon Witchard,
Who're you?

REUBEN

My name is Reuben Warshovsky.
VERNON

Warshovsky? What kind of name is

that? ,
REUBEN

It's the kind you have to spell
for telephone operators and
headwaiters.

VERNON
What do you want?

REUBEN
I'd like to get me a room with
a mill family.

VERNON
What for? We got a hotel with
12 rooms and a motel with 24
rooms.

REUBEN
I want to get to know some mill
hands. Close up.

VERNON
Why is that?

REUBEN
Mr. Witchard...I got into town
about an hour ago, parked my
rented car, got out, and, before
I could adjust my crotch, the
Chief of Police was on me, saying
‘Who are you, I don't know you!
and 'what the hell are you doing
here?! I told him I was a labor
organizer, come to put a union
in the 0.P. Henley textile mill,
and he said, 'The fuck you are!!
gave me a ticket and told me to
get my ass elsewhere right quick.

Norma has appeared behind her father and listens curiously.

VERNON

He's dead right. As far as I'm
concerned, you're all Communists
or agitators or crooks or Jews
or all four together. Any town
you show up, folks get thrown
out of work and get their heads
busted.

REUBEN
What .do you make an hour,
Mr. Witchard?

VERNON
Two dollars and eighteen cents!

REUBEN
When did you have your last
cost-of-living raise?

VERNON
I never had that.

REUBEN
With all due respect, Mr. Witchard,
with today's inflation, that makes
you a shlemiel,.

VERNON
You calling me some kind of name
or other?!

REUBEN

You're underpaid. You're
overworked. They're shafting you,
right up to your tonsils. You
need me.

If you hurry, you can get to the
fence before my dog bites you.

NORMA
What're you telling him that for?
We don't have a dog.

REUBEN
(looking at her
father)
You don't need one.

He hefts the heavy suitcases, turns and goes.
INT. GOLDEN CHERRY MOTEL 16

The place has never seen better days. It was always none
too clean, familiar with the hot-pillow trade and other
transients. The rooms have a view of a blacktop parking
area and a scummy swimming pool.

Norma sits in the small lobby, flipping through the pages
of a magazine, ignored by ALSTON PURVIS, the desk clerk.

She looks up with some surprise as Reuben enters, by now

footsore and weary. He recognizes her.

REUBEN
This is one friendly little town
you got here. I've been told to
shove off, to piss off, and to
git off.

NORMA
(mildly)
This place is okay. Just make
sure they spray the room for
roaches.

GEORGE BENSON enters. He is a large man, floridly handsome,
commanding, with an edge of violence just concealed. He
walks straight past Norma for the stairs, making only a
peremptory beckoning gesture. She tosses aside the magazine
and rises to follow.

INT. MOTEL ROOM . 17

The SHOWER is HEARD RUNNING from the open bathroom. Norma
sits on the edge of the torn-apart bed, fastening her

bra; she gets up and pulls on her jeans. Her face is
impassive; whatever has transpired in the past hour has
left her unmoved.

George comes in, a towel wrapped around his middie, his
hair still streaming. He combs his hair at the mirror,
drops of water spraying.

GEORGE
I'll be back this way next
Wednesday. After dinner. I'm
having dinner with my wife's

folks.

NORMA
Tonight was the last time,
George.

He doesn't turn. The. comb simply moves a little more
slowly.

GEORGE
You don't say, Norma Rae. Isn't
that a surprising turn.

NORMA
No. It's been coming for some
time.

GEORGE

Well, isn't that funny, I didn't
notice it. Didn't you get your
steak dinner? Didn't you get
your box of pralines? Didn't
you get your French red wine?
Didn't you come three times in
a row in that bed over there?

me anymore, George. You got
your wife, you got your two
kids in high school, there's a
lot of gossip, I got my two
kids... ~

«ee don't know...it just
doesn't make me feel good.

You're here to make me feel

He advances on her.

NORMA
I'm not trotting down here
anymore.

GEORGE
Why, you hick. You got dirt
under your fingernails, you
leave hair in the sink, you
pick your teeth with a matchbook
-- I've seen you! Why, shit,
what are you good for -- to come
out of the factory, wash under
your armpits, spread your legs
for a poke and go home. And
you're dumping me!

He hits her hard across the mouth; the impact sends her
hurtling across the room, slamming against the opposite
wall.

WALKWAY 18

She stumbles once or twice in the walkway, pauses to shove
her blouse inside her pants.

Reuben is standing at the open door to his room as she
passes it. He speaks coolly.

REUBEN
I heard a hell of a thump.

NORMA

That was me, getting thrown
across the room.

You better come in.

She follows him into his room.

He goes into the bathroom, returns with a washcloth, dumos
ice cubes out of his Coke, hands her the icepack. She puts
it gingerly against her face.

She gets up and begins to wander around. He has already
established himself; books are stacked and piled everywher. .
papers litter the desk, clothes are dumped on the bed and
hang from the backs of chairs.

IN FRONT OF THE MOTEL | a1

Vernon sits parked at the wheel of his battered blue
Dodge. As Norma comes out into the night, he waves his
hand and calls to her.

VERNON
Over here, honey,

She stops short on the pavement, turns and stares a moment,
exasperation visible. Then she comes to him.

VERNON
Thought I'd come down and give
you a ride home.

She merely looks at him.
VERNON

You ain't got any packages.

NO

I ain't got any explanations,
either.

VERNON
Come on, sweetheart. Get in.

INT. THE CAR 22

She slides in beside him, but she is angry and shows him a
stony profile.

- VERNON

cream cone?
It is useless to hold out against him.
NORMA

Sure. You treat me like I'm
twelve anyhow. Why not?

VERNON
That's my girl.

Beaming, he pulls away and drives off.

EXT, MILL 23

Norma and her parents and a throng of mill workers surge
through the chain link fence toward the looming, dirt-
streaked, windowless red brick building which will swallow
them all for the day. It is a spiritless mass of people,
silently set for their labor, carrying with them the
weariness of season after season. There are no swapped
greetings; this work exacts a toll in mind and muscle.

NORMA AND REUBEN a4

As she goes through the fence, she comes face to face with
Reuben again; his energy is up. He thrusts a leaflet from
a large stack under his arm at each man and woman who pass.
Suddenly, he finds he is handing one to Norma. She scans
it quickly.

NORMA
There's too many big words in
here. If I don't understand it,
they ain't gonna understand it.

She shoves it back at him and is immediately lost in the
crowd. He stops his activity and stands there in some
puzzlement, reading his own flyer once again.

NORMA 25

A bossman, JIMMY JEROME DAVIS, stands in front of her as
she is about to enter the building.

NORMA
Morning, Jimmy Jerome.

The man gestures back toward the fence with his head.

JIMMY
That fellow a friend of yours,
Norma?
NORMA
(shrugging)
Looks like he's getting to be.
JIMMY
Better hotfoot it or you'll
be late.
NORMA

I don't care if I don't get
there 'til tomorrow.

But she goes in.

AT THE FENCE 26
The last of the mill hands has entered. Reuben is finaly

alone and prepares to go. But as he turns, he finds
Jimmy Jerome in his path.

about every four years -- about

the same time we get the locusts.

REUBEN

contempt. Maybe we can make it
seven. '

JIMMY

Why, hell, we plaster the
toilet with them things.

He turns and goes. The gate in the fence closes and
Reuben is on the outside.

NORMA 27
In the weaving room, the back of her shirt already wet.
TEDDY BOB KEELER, a fellow worker, taps her on the shoulder;
she looks around; he indicates a BOSSMAN beckoning to her
from his office.
NORMA
I already told him I wouldn't go
out to dinner with him. What's
he want now?
TEDDY BOB
Maybe he wants to make it breakfast,

She makes a deprecating gesture and marches off to the
summons.

He has the hard look of a hard-living man, used to dealing
with hunting dogs and menials. Norma enters and goes on
the attack.

NORMA
Whatever it is, I didn't do it.

GARDNER
Norma, you got the biggest mouth
in this mill. Give us longer breaks,
give us more smoking time, give us
a Kotex machine --

NORMA
Do it and I'll shut up.

GARDNER
Well, we're gonna do better'n
that. We figure the only way
to close that mouth is to hand
you a promotion. You're rising
in the world, honey.

NORMA
Yeah? How far and for how much?

GARDNER
We're gonna put you on as a
spot-checker.

NORMA
It ain't gonna make me any friends.

GARDNER
It's gonna make you another dollar
and a half an hour.

She chews it over. It seems hard to digest.

NORMA . 29
She is on the floor, clipboard in one hand, stopwatch in
the other. She has paused behind LUCIUS WHITE, a black
man, and is timing him as he rethreads a loom. When he
finishes, she clicks her watch, enters a notation on the
board, moves on.

She is behind GEORGE HUBBARD, watches as he unstops a
spindle. Again, she clicks her watch, marks his time.

ANOTHER ANGLE 31

She times RAY BUCK completing a run of towels, records
his speed.

ANOTHER ANGLE 32

Finally, she stands behind her father. Vernon works at the
bobbins, doing the job he has done ali his life. He pauses
only an instant to rub the back of his neck, hurries to
recover the tempo. He grins at his daughter over his
shoulder,

Norma is troubled and unhappy.

VERNON
How'm I doin! little girl?

NORMA
You better speed it up, Daddy --
if you can.

VERNON
(protesting)
I'm goin' as fast as I can.

NORMA
They're watching me and they're
watching you...

The old man grimly bends forward and his hands fly as he
pulls bobbins and threads them.

EXT, VERNON'S YARD 33

Craig and Millie in the b.g., climb in and out of a battered
cardboard carton, which for them is a train; the SOUNDS of
their shouting and laughing rise in the early evening air.

VERNON 34

He. stands on the open back porch at a galvanized tub,
scrubbing his hands and face. As he dries off, he uses the
towel to whack some of the clinging lint from his shirt
and his pants.

Norma comes out on the porch; she goes to brush the lint
which mats his hair, making him look like a white-haired
man of eighty. Vernon stiffly pulls away from her.

NORMA
Well, I suppose you're sore at me.

I don't think you should push
your own daddy.

Norma stands troubled. She calls out to her children, almost
absently.

NORMA

Grandma's marigolds.

She sits on the top step, hugs her knees, broods.
EXT. BASEBALL FIELD - NIGHT 35

A game is in progress on the pokey little baseball diamond
with weak night lights and a splintered, faded green
two-tiered set of bleachers. Bugs wheel endlessly around
the lights, tree FROGS CROAK, there is nothing so grand as
uniforms -- the two teams play in their work clothes. The
scoreboard, broken and sagging, reads: MILLAGEVILLE 15,
PISTON 12, :

There is a sudden thunderclap of wild excitement, bringing
everyone to their feet, as the batter powers one far into
the darkness of right field, bringing in the two men
already on base and tying the score.

Norma Rae and Bonnie Mae sit down again with flushed faces.

MOVING SHOT 39

Drinks in hand, they wander around the perimeter of the ball
field. Cars are parked facing the game, spectators sitving
in them, drinking beer; kids sit or lie atop sedans, watching
the action.

Young kids on bikes stand, one foot on the pedal, one on
the ground. A few young couples sit in the grass, infants
crawling not too far from them.

He's never done anything worthwhile

REUBEN
Were you married?

NORMA
He didn't bother and I didn't
bother.

: REUBEN
My first affair, as I recollect it,
was with my Hungarian piano teacher.
I was playing Smetana and she put her
head in my lap. I played the hell
out of it. We ended up in the

' bedroom under a Russian icon, and

C her husband came home and found us

and burst into tears. I went and
put my arms around him and said
‘I'm sorry, I'm sorry,' and then
we all went into the kitchen and
had 4 glass of tea.

She looks at him oddly.

NORMA
Seems like every time you run into
me, I'm hassling with some other guy.

REUBEN
That's what it seems like.

NORMA
What do you think of me, I wonder?

REUBEN
I think you're too smart for

He lets her think that over -- and she does. They keep
walking in silence.

Men lined at the bar still grimy from the job, getting the
taste of work out of their mouths; drink ends almost every
day and it is not boisterous -- it is serious and dogged,
an anodyne.

At the back, Norma and Sonny sit in a wooden booth, marked

with cigarette burns. Soft drinks, a bucket of ice, and a

pottle of bourbon in a brown paper bag stand on the scarred
linoleum-topped table; they have made considerable inroads

in the liquor.

There are plain wooden walls, plain wooden pews, and a totally

a little tentative, as if they were intruding, and they halt
in the entrance. A large, impressive man, JAMES BROWN, waves
them on in with his straw hat. They walk all the way down to

brightly colored picture of Jesus, a jelly glass filled with
wild flowers. The people wait in silence, patiently.

MOVING SHOT - CAR 67

Reuben drives down a winding dirt country road, past dry pine
forests, fields of tobacco plants, row after row of cotton.
Now and again there is a bleached wooden shack with a tin roof
off which the sun glints. It is a dry, somnolent, empty
landscape, hard to unlock, hard to invade.

A turn in the road shows Reuben the church up ahead -- and,
at that instant, his car goes out of control.

THE CAR , 68

He spins the wheel, which is suddenly loose in his hands,
slams his foot against the brake again and again, but the car
is out of control and hurtles wildly in a careening slide,
leaving the road, bumping across a field, while he continues
vainly fighting the steering wheel. The car crashes into a
pine tree, bursting into flames.

THE CAR 69

The door is jammed and, as he scuttles across to the other
side, the windshield heats and cracks and EXPLODES. Reuben
hauls himself through the open window, falling to the ground,
rising quickly and backing away from the heat.

Figures come running from the church in the distance.

Reuben leans panting against a tree as some of the blacks
approach. For a moment, everyone stands silently watching
the car burn with great gouts of black smoke.

He stands in front of the quiet, hopeful, needful people who
have risked something to be here. He speaks very simply.

REUBEN :
On October 4, 1970, my grandfather,
Isaac Abraham Warshovsky, aged 87,
died in his sleep in New York City.
On the following Friday morning,
his funeral was held. My mother
and father attended, my two. uncles
from Brooklyn attended, my
Aunt Minnie came up from Florida.
Also present were 862 members of
The Amalgamated Clothing Workers
and The Cloth, Hat and Cap Makers'
Union. Also members of his family.

C In death as in life, they stood

CO at his side. They had fought
battles with him, bound the wounds
of battle with him, had earned
bread together and had broken it
together. When they spoke, they
spoke in one voice, and they were
heard. They were black, they were
white, they were Irish, they were
Polish, they were Catholic, they
were Jews, they were one. That's
what a union is: one. !

(pauses)
Ladies and gentlemen, the textile
industry, in which you are
spending your lives and your
substance, and in which your
children and their children will
spend their lives and substance,
is the only industry in the whole
length and breadth of the
United States of America that is
not unionized. Therefore, they
are free to exploit you, to cheat
you, to lie to you, and to take
away what is rightfully yours --

myself last summer.

ANOTHER ANGLE 76
They all turn to the little table on which his WIFE has
prepared six tumblers and a bottle of red wine. Sonny
raises his glass in a toast.
SONNY

To my wife, Norma -- and I sure

hope I can keep up with her.

INT. BEDROOM - SONNY'S HOUSE 78

Sonny sits on the edge of the bed in his pajama bottoms,
removing the price tag from the top. He then pulls it over
his head, smooths back his hair, sits waiting. Norma emerges
from the bathroom in a nightgown.

NORMA |
Hot water tap's leaking
in there.

SONNY 1

Needs a washer. ,
(then)

That sure is a pretty nightgown.

NORMA
Look at it quick, ‘cause I'm
going to take it off.

She comes and sits beside him on the bed.

NORMA
You happy?

SONNY
Well, I got another chance
to be.

They are interrupted by a hideous SOUND, the LOUD BLASTING of
a CAR HORN. It is no mere tapping of a horn; it is a
continuous, insistent, nerve-scraping blare, beginning very
close, as though the car were right under their window, then
gradually receding as the car drives away; finally ceasing
altogether.

ANOTHER ANGLE 79
as Norma. leans to her husband. They go into each other's arms ‘
for a long embrace.

The RACKET RESUMES, more emphatic than before, severing the
intimacy. The CAR HORN is a raucous, jarring howl, continuing
for a long, long moment directly under their window. Norma
sits back tensely, alerted. Again, the assault begins to
DIMINISH, as the car cruises slowly away. It becomes a WAIL
in the distance and again DISAPPEARS.

Sonny draws her fiercely into his arms, pulls her down onto
the bed, throws the covers over then.

They begin to make love.

The HORN STARTS AGAIN. The maniacal shivaree fills the
night; it is a relentless intrusion, a relentless invasion.

Norma suddenly flings back the covers, snatches up a robe,
flings it around her and runs out.

EXT. THE STREET 81

She stands on the porch, yelling at the top of her voice at
the car that is slowly cruising away, HORN STILL BLATANT.

NORMA
Daddy, I know it's youl
I know it's youl Quit itl
Leave me alonel Quit
messing with mel Go homel
There's only room for two
in that bed in there!

The car goes around a corner and the SOUND of the HORN EBBS.
The street is suddenly very quiet.

INT. BEDROOM 82

Norma returns to Sonny, throwing the robe aside. She is
defiant, angry, agitated. She snaps off the light, gets back
into bed. But they lie still, tense, waiting for the
inexorable return. The moments pass. The night is peaceful.
Slowly Norma relaxes.

NORMA
It's all right now.

She turns to her husband, goes into his arms. A long moment
passes, then the light. goes on. Sonny sits up in bed,
defeated.

SONNY
I'm sorry, honey, I can't do
nothing.

Norma turns out the light again. In the dark, her VOICE is
HEARD, determined.

NORMA
Yes, you canl

The other presence in the room is to be fended off.

THREE BOSSMEN 83

Three very grim, hard-faced men stand at the gate as the
morning shift passes them: RICK LUJAN, DAN PETERS,
WOODROW BOWZER. The mood is one of confrontation, testy,
edgy, muscular.

ANOTHER ANGLE 84

They don't have long to wait. Reuben appears, dressed in '
tennis shoes, jeans and a golf slicker, a large TWUA button '
on his chest. He is gulping his breakfast en route, a :
doughnut and a paper cup of coffee. '

He steps up to the three men with a manner that is cool, firm, |
and peremptory.

REUBEN
Okay, I'm here, and I'm ready
to look at your plant.

The three men just stand immobile, presenting a formidable
barrier.

REUBEN
The federal government of the
United States, brothers, in
Federal Court Order Number
7778, states the following:
the union has the right to
inspect every bulletin board
in the mills at least once a
week, to verify in person that
its notices are not being
stripped off.

He is finished with the coffee and looks around.

REUBEN
You got a trash can?

Bowzer indicates one nearby with his granite jaw. Reuben.
tosses the empty cup into it.

REUBEN
Keep America beautiful.

They flank him and escort him inside.
IN THE MILL 85

“ The DIN is at full pitch, as always. LEROY MASON is waiting

for them. He dispenses with greetings and hands Reuben a pair
of earmuffs.

Cont.

85 Cont.

Reuben looks around, notes that they are not standard issue,
hands them back.

REUBEN
I think I'll just keep my
ears open, friend.

It is necessary for voices to be raised in order to be heard
above the NOISE; Mason hears him. He turns abruptly and
begins the progress. They march, prison-style, Mason in
front, Reuben in the center, the three bossmen bringing up the
rear.

MOVING SHOT 86

Mason goes at quick-step, taking off like a striped ape.
Reuben lets him go. After fifty feet, a hundred, Mason stops,
turns, sees that Reuben is not with him, and storms back.

MASON
Am I going too quick for you
or something?

REUBEN
Look, man, I don't do high
port. I did my running when
iL was in the Marine Corps.
I'm not in the Marine Corps
now.

MASON
Well, if you're not in shape,
we'll slow down...

REUBEN
Yeah. I'd appreciate that.
Let's just saunter.

ANOTHER ANGLE 87

The line of march begins again and Reuben swerves right out cf
it. He approaches JED BUFFUM at a loom, taking a pad and
pencil out of his shirt pocket.

REUBEN
Good morning. I'm Reuben Warshovsky
of the Textile Workers! Union
of America. What's your name,
brother?

Cont.
 

BUFFUM

(uneasily)
O Buffun.

REUBEN
How long you worked here,
Mr. Buffum?

BUFFUM
1 Twelve years.

REUBEN
Like your job?

BUFFUM
Like to keep it.

ANOTHER ANGLE 88
The cohort of bossmen surrounds him again.
BOWZER
Warshovsky, you're interfering

with the work, and the court
order says you can't do that.

! REUBEN
OC Well, then, brother, let's
SF both keep to the letter of
the law.
BOWZER
(mildly)
I don't have no kike brother.
REUBEN

I don't think you meant to
use that word.

BOWZER
Yeah, I did.

REUBEN
Shit, now I gotta stop and
get into a fight.

Mason steps between them.
MASON
The bulletin board is right
over there.

The words separate the two antagonists. Reuben turns and
4 strides directly to it.

AT THE BULLETIN BOARD 89

He stands with his hands in his back pockets, rocking back
and forth on his heels, looking at’ the board. The others come
up behind him.

REUBEN

Somebody's looking to get
into a carpool...somebody
wants to sell a bassett pup

at forty cents a bushel at
Selma Landing...

Only thing missing is my
notice.

LUJAN
It's there.

REUBEN
I don't see it.

The man points up high, to the very top of the board.
Reuben's eyes follow his gesture.

REUBEN
Wilt Chamberlain on stilts could
read it, maybe.
(voice hardens)
Put it at eye level, fuckers,
where everybody can read it.

One or two of the bossmen bridle at the epithet but Mason
maintains order.

MASON
We'll take note of your
request.

REUBEN

(spreads his

hands )
Why do you guys try this
horseshit? Now I got to
go to the phone and call
my lawyers and get 'em on

quietly)

ANOTHER ANGLE

as Lujan scrapes a chair over, heaves his bulk up on it, pries
out the thumbtacks while the other men stand watching, and

puts it in a lower and more prominent position.

Reuben steps forward to read the notice carefully.

ANOTHER ANGLE

SAM BOLEN hurries over, wheezing hard and full of self-

importance.

BOLEN
You're not supposed to read
the damn thing!

REUBEN
No union organizer, not even
a@ Known union member, has been
inside the fences or walls of
this factory in more than ten
years. I'm reading it.

BOLEN
Read fast.

REUBEN
While I'm reading this, tell
you what -- you go read the
court order that says any
agent of this company can be
held in contempt. You're
messing with a contempt
citation, and if you're hot
for jail just keep it up.

MOVING SHOT 92

The contingent turns and marches across the length of the
weaving room, over the bucking floor, through the snowstorm of
lint, past workers who are alerted to his presence there, who
turn over their shoulders to watch him, who exchange a furtive
word. Reuben takes it all in; more than that, he draws
attention to himself:

REUBEN
Hello, there...how are you
this morning?...Warshovsky
of the TWUA...morning, ma'am,
Reuben Warshovsky, TWUA...
hello there, sir. I'ma

Oo NORMA 93

Among those he passes is Norma. They exchange an especially
significant look.

THE MARCH gl

The company phalanx grows larger as they go, with each
addition taller and broader than Reuben.

SECOND BULLETIN BOARD 95

There are boxes and bolts of cloth arranged and stacked in
such a way as to completely block the board.

Confronted with the contempt the company has for its work
force, the obvious manipulation he sees, he stands
thoughtfully a moment. It is beyond anger or outburst.

REUBEN
You know, gentlemen, your
average working man isn't
stupid -- he just gets tired.

REUBEN'S MOTEL ROOM 98

It is a shambles of abandoned meals, cartons, filing cabinets,
empty Coke bottles, dirty towels, shucked clothes, union
applications, battered typewriter, just-washed T-shirts
hanging, dripping, on the floor from chairs and light fixtures.

Reuben is forking cole slaw out of a carton as he studies a
brief. ‘There is a KNOCK.

He opens the door to Norma.

NORMA
You heard from Dorothy Finkelstein?

REUBEN
Yeah. She sent me a box of
onion bagels. They're ina

NORMA
I smell 'em.

She picks up the picture idly, turns it this way and that.

NORMA

She gives him a long, level look.

NORMA
If I joined up with you,
would I lose my job?

REUBEN
No way! You can wear a union
button as big as a frisbee when
you go to work. You can talk
union to any mill hand who wants

FRONT HALL 100

Norma enters, burdened with two large bags of groceries and,
as she wrestles with the bags at the door and tries to get the

door shut with her foot, one splits and potatoes tumble out
and roll across the floor.

NORMA
Damn! I told 'em to double

ANOTHER ANGLE 101

As she is on the floor, trying to retrieve the spilled
groceries, Sonny comes hastily to kneel beside her; over his
shoulder, in the living room, she sees a strange woman.

He suddenly raises his head and sniffs the air. Then he leaps
up and out of his chair and bolts from the room.

EXT. YARD 104

Millie is doubled over in gleeful laughter as Craig runs from
place to place in the yard, striking large kitchen matches and
igniting the weeds. Already a patch or two are burning very
nicely.

Sonny runs up to Craig, scoops him up and gives him a healthy
whack across the buttocks. The child wails in outrage. Sonny
raises his hand again -- and then holds it.

The two women have come out on the porch. Sonny shouts across
the yard at Mrs. Johnson.

SONNY
You might as well see it, ‘cause

He gives the boy another whack, drops him, runs for the garden
hose and begins to spray the flames:

mending the lectern as Norma comes in. .

that I've sinned and I've done
wrong and I'm sorry and I want
God to forgive me. Now I want
to see what this church stands
for. I want to see if you'll
stand up in that pulpit and say
there should be justice, there
should be union, if you're
oppressed, fight back, if you're
smitten, rise up -- and the Lord'll
be on your side. If you don't do
that, I say there's nothing in
this church that's any good to
me and I'll leave it flat.

Norma pulls up to the curb behind Reuben's car, parks

on the outskirts of town, Saturday leisure for half
a dozen men in work clothes from.the mill consists of
sitting or squatting on the gallery of the store with
pocketknives and chunks of wood. Reuben puts his foot
up on the porch while Norma takes an RC Cola out of the
ice chest and cools down.

“In a gesture calculated to make him one of them, Reuben
takes out a penknife, pries open a blade and begins to
whittle as he addresses the men in dumb-show. Chips
fly off his stick as he becomes evermore impassioned,
The men listen impassively. Before he knows it, he
has whittled his stick down to a toothpick, which snaps
in his hands.

Norma laughs.

A crude, misspelled, hand-lettered sign reads: "PIG
PETE'S BAR-B-Q...PORK RIBS, PORK CHOPS, PIG'S NUCKLES,
PIG'S FEET."

Reuben sets himself a little grimly, reaches around his
neck to remove the chain with the large Mogen Navid on
it, and tucks in manfully as Norma distributes leaflets
to the men clustered around.

E. A YARD
A mill worker keeps chickens in a roost and a single
dairy cowe As Reuben stands in close and serious talk
with the man, the cow wanders up. Reuben puts a hand
on its rump and shoves it -- the cow bellows, wheels
and shits as it lumbers away -- and Reuben is splattered
from chin to boots. Norma offers a laconic comment.

NORMA
It's only grass and water,
Reuben...
AT A SWIMMING HOLE lel

A little river running through sand and clay, the grass
spotted with blue and white daisies, sheltered by a row
of sedge. The sun is high, the air still, and Reuben
is in the water, rolling and snorting, naked, content.

away with two fingers. She pauses to erase, pecks again,
makes another mistake, erases again, pulls the paper out,
crumples it up and throws it down. She yawns widely.

BOBBIN ROOM 137

In the thundering weave section, amidst the DIN and the
flying lint, a spot-checker stops behind Vernon, working
down a row of pumping bobbins. The man shakes his shoulder,
shouts in his ear, indicating that he should speed up.
Vernon's hands fly, he works at top speed; sweating with the
exertion.

THE CHURCH 138
Reuben opens the door to the Chockoyotte Church and enters.
INT, CHURCH 139

It is empty. A kitten has gotten in and picks its way along

In a moment he is back with a steaming pot in his hand. He
lifts the lid.

WARREN

quarts of water in there,
Supper for seven people. Go

He kicks the door shut in Reuben's face, Reuben explodes;
the street fighter in him comes out. He pounds on the decor
with his fist until it threatens to give away on its rotting
hinges and shouts at the top of his voice,

REUBEN
Goddamn it, Warren, don't slam
the fucking door on me! I'm
trying to get you power!

In the house on either side, startled faces appear at the
windows to glimpse the disturber of the peace.

banners and pennants » U.S. flags front and back and a large
sign on top saying, "I'M FOR TWUA."

As Wayne enters, he finds four impassive faces regarding him
coolly. He drops an impressive-looking batch of cards down
on the desk.

Here's some more bodies for
you.

Reuben flips one over to James, who glances at it briefly.

JAMES
Bodies is right, This one's

Reuben rises. There is suddenly an impending sense of
violence in the closely-packed little room,

REUBEN

He throws the false cards into his face. Wayne's mouth cpens
and closes, opens and closes again. He looks from one tc the
other; all four are clenched against him. He suddenly gces
beserk, He stomps out.

EXT, MOTEL 150

He runs to the station wagon, a bull on a rampage, strips the
huge sign off the’ top and starts tearing it violently to
pieces. He rips off the banners, the pennants, the signs,
the flags, flinging them onto the blacktop, stomping on them,
grinding them under his heels, flailing the wooden poles that
held them against the side of the car until they splinter.

Then he reaches through the window into the glove compartment,
snatches up something, and comes running back,

ANOTHER ANGLE 151

Reuben and the others have stepped into the open doorway to

watch him. Hysterical, the man charges up at him, scrabbles
through a box of cartridges, grabs a bullet and rams it into
Reuben's belly.

Wayne's head is shaking from side to side; otherwise, he seems
paralyzed. Reuben takes the bullet from his hand, lifts the
hand, opens the palm, holds the bullet suspended above it,
then drops it in.

BOBBIN ROOM 153

Vernon works at an accelerated clip, the bobbins reeling off
yarn. He is like a man at stoop labor, bending, rising,
bending, rising.

harsh, graves wrested out of rocky soil. People who have
spent their lives in unremitting work come to a stony resting
place here,

Norma, Leona, the children, Sonny, uncomfortable in a dark
suit, stand by the open grave as the pine box is lowered.
Reuben and a group of mill hands, friends of Vernon's, stand
at a respectful distance.

A truck lumbers past the mourners, backs up to the open grave.
The grave diggers step out of the way. The tailgate drops
down; white sand sifts down onto the pine box in a steady
stream, slowly covering it. Norma turns to her mother.

Every inch of space is now in full use; even the bathtub is
crammed with cartons and papers. PULL BACK. Somehow a
card table has been wedged into the bathroom and two girls
sit facing each other at typewriters, hard at it.

INT, MOTEL ROOM 169

A dozen people fill the single motel room, stuffing
envelopes, addressing them, checking off lists, on the

PETER GALLAT comes through the door and Norma, looking up
from her work table, attacks him immediately.

The silence in. thé room persists.

INT, COFFEE SHOP 171

In the shop attached to the motel, looking out on the
scummy pool, Norma sits alone over a cup of coffee and a
wedge of pie. But the food remains untouched before her.
She is thinking.

The door swings open and Reuben. enters, looking around. He
sees her and ambles over, slides into the booth across from
her. He looks at her for a long, level moment.

She says nothing. He takes her fork, samples her pie, likes
it, pulls it toward him and begins to eat it.

A YARD 175

A fight breaks out, one of the white workers rounding on a
black, sending him dazed to his knees with a violent blow.
The black is up instantly and at the white: a close-in,
savage fight. In the next moment, the confrontation expands;
four whites join in, half a dozen blacks meet them, more
whites advance. There is now a general melee in the yard.
There is an uproar as each side champions its own.

Company men come on the run to quell it.

Sipping from a paper cup on her coffee break, Norma saunters
toward the bulletin board and past it. She turns with
elaborate nonchalance, comes back and stops in front of it.
She reads quickly, then shuts her eyes tight, her mouth
moving. She hits her head with the palm of her hand, as if
to drive the information home. Then she hurries to the

position he has in Norma's life.

SONNY
She had one call and she called
you.
REUBEN
(shrugs )

She knew I could make bail.

SONNY
You come in here, you mix her
up, you turn her head all around.
She's all changed. I didn't want
her to be a front-runner -- I
didn't want that. What's gonna
happen to us now?

REUBEN
She stood up on a table. She's
a free woman. Maybe you can
live with it -- maybe you can't.

He turns and walks out of the house.

INT. BEDROOM 211
Norma is in bed, her hands behind her head, awake, silent,
turned inward. Sonny enters from the bathroom, ready for
bed. His shoes are in his way; he bends to pick them up
and move them.

SONNY
Got a broken shoelace...

NORMA
There's another pair in the
drawer.

No.

NORMA
Sonny is silent for a long moment.

SONNY
I'll see you through getting
tired, getting sick, getting
old. I'11 see you through
anything that comes up. 'Cause
there's nobody else in my head.
Just you.

He turns out the light, turns his back to her. ‘She lies
( in the darkened room a moment, then places her hand on his
Oo back in a gesture of response.

EXT, STREET 212

Dense with a crowd of mill hands, a pervasive silence
hanging over them as they throng the street from curb to
curb, restless, charged, waiting, simmering in the heat
of the late afternoon.

NORMA 213

She paces outside the gate, alone in the crowd, her hands
thrust in her pockets, intent on the iron balcony high in
the side of the plant, waiting to see a figure, to hear

a sound, to receive word. This is the moment of promise,
the moment of fulfillment.

INT. MILL 214
The place is jammed, men sweating in the close confines of
the room. There are a dozen men with tags across their

shirt fronts. A dozen newspaper and television reporters
observe and record, flashbulbs going off now and then.

‘AT THE LONG TABLE 215

The men here are divided into two groups, half of them
BOSSMEN from the company, the other half UNION MEN. Huge
stacks of paper ballots are being tabulated from the "NO"
and "YES" piles.

The tension is palpable, each piece of paper a victory or
a@loss. Management is frozen-faced and silent. There are
no smiles, no talk. Men-stand up on chairs to crane and

watch the.count.

ANOTHER ANGLE 216

James Brown hoists Bonnie up on his chair, shares it with
her so that she too can see. They share hope as the
ballots are shuffled, as the two piles diminish, as the
silent marks are made, for and against.

IN THE REAR 217

an OLD MAN, pressed against the wall by the crowd, begins
to weep, unable any longer to withstand the suspense, is
ashamed, reaches for a soiled handkerchief, surreptitiously
wipes his eyes.

LINETTE ODUM 218

mashed among the people, she holds a snapshot against
her chest, turns it to look down at it -- it is the visage
of a middle-aged man, gaunt, wasted.

She looks from the snapshot to the tabulators, back and
forth, back and forth, waiting to be avenged.

A YOUNG WOMAN 219

blonde, frail, in the stifling heat and the crush, she
suddenly faints.

The pack is so great that she does not fall, is held up
by the bodies around her, merely sags against a MAN beside
her. He holds her, “takés a knotted kerchief from his neck
and mops her brow, looks around.for a way to get her out.
But there is no way, so he supports her in his arms.

FULL SHOT 220

There is a stir, a final shuffling of feet, then absolute
silence as a labor board AGENT raises his hand at the table.

IN THE HALL 221
There is a tumultuous, roaring shout from the assembled
mill hands, a hosanna of triumph. The open-throated
outery goes on and on and on.

REUBEN 222

at the back of the room, near the door, he spins on his
heel and walks out.

EXT, GATE - FULL SHOT 223

Norma, outside the gate, stops her pacing as Reuben emerges

and stands’ a moment on the balcony. They stand motionless,
So looking at each other, across the distance that separates

them.

Then he starts down toward her,

NORMA AND REUBEN 22h

as he comes up to her.

He says only one word.

REUBEN
Done.

NORMA
Did we trounce 'em?

REUBEN

We did good enough.

They walk along together, pushing through the crowd.
Behind them, up on the balcony, a MAN comes out and shouts
to the crowd below:

MOVING SHOT - NORMA AND REUBEN 225

They turn a corner and are alone. They walk toward his
car parked at the curb, front seat sagging under books,
suitcases and cartons jammed in the back, obscuring the
rear window.

NORMA
You gonna drive straight through?

Yeah.

It is ho mere ritual of farewell; the touch

But it must end. They are comrades-in-arms,

they are

battle-weary, they are triumphant. Whatever else they

might be remains unspoken.
