 "To my mind, there is no controversy 
about Birth Control, except in so far 
as how and by whom it should be 
exercised. When a poor woman appears 
before me with her sickly, underfed, 
unwashed brood of nine children and 
says she does not want to take back 
her drunken husband because it will 
mean another child added to her burden 
in a few months, my heart and soul cry 
aloud for a law that will permit a 
doctor to tell her openly what he has 
told the rich woman is secret."

Stelk, Chicago, February 8, 1917.)
