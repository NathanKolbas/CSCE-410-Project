EXT. VILLAGE - DAY 8
The General Store. A woman sweeps the sidewalk. A man
is nailing up a sign announcing "Summer Hours." A

small marina, new boats piled up. The Buick crosses a
tiny bridge. We SEE a channel, bordered by houses,
opening onto the lake.

EXT. LAKE - DAY 9
The CAMERA PANS DOWN TO it and across its surface, and
we SEE the lake's personalities:

EXT. COVE - DAY 10
The water is calm and relaxed, golden where the sun

hits the shallowest parts.

EXT. PENINSULA - DAY 11

Little waves lap the scraggly shore,

EXT. OPEN SEA - DAY 12
Bigger waves, angrier, white-capped, bouncing hard

against white-topped rocks, red and black buoys bobbing
in the swells.

EXT. SHORELINE - DAY 13
God's greenest trees, towerin high, bending occasion-

ally to the water. Rolling along behind them is the
Buick.

Little modern things, with lots of glass, too close
together. Two young men are mooring out a sailboat.

EXT. ESTATE -"DAY. ||. oo 47

"A sprawling place, with tennis courts and manicured lawns.
- Several men are working, pruning trees.

EXT. CAMP KOOCHAKIYI - DAY 18

Little cabins and dining hall. Float and docks on the
beach, boats and canoes being painted.

EXT. COTTAGES —-DAY : a Lg.

 

Pp , two stories high, rambling
porch, a widow's watch. On the bank. are piled sections
of a dock, and a float with a diving board. The yard is

covered with pine needles. The board storm doors

have been taken off the front of the house and now lean
on the porch... There's an old washtub in the back, full
of dirt, where later flowers will grow.

The Buick pulls into the yard. “Ethel jumps out, Norman

follows slowly. Ethel dashes round the side of the *

house down to the dock, making Loon calls. From the *

distance the Loons answer. Ethel turns to Norman who *

stands at the side of the house watching bemused. *

wo, ETHEL ‘*

Norman. The Loons: They heard me! *

‘Hello Golden Pond. We're here. *

Norman fumbles with keys, and opens the door. Ethel *
follows. .

INT. HOUSE = DAY . . 21

Norman and Ethel step into the living room.

It is large; -high-ceilinged, comfortable-looking.

There's a cheery glow from the lake, which can be SEEN
THROUGH the large WINDOWS. The room is practically alive
with character and history. Its furniture, eclectic and
interesting, is mostly hidden now by dust covers, and there
are porch chairs and tables piled up inside as well.

On the walls we SEE an amazing chronicle of a family.
Hundreds of photographs, diplomas and 4-H ribbons, and
drawings, and yellowed newspaper clippings.

CONTINUED:

The whole room, indsea, as we'll see, the whole house,

is a huge album of memories. There are old fishing hats
on-a rack, and old jackets, fishpoles, boat cushions,
anchors, a water ski, knicknacks galore, pine cones, stuffed
fish, and the like, and hundreds of wonderful books, coll-
ections. of Dumas.and Twain and Dickens and Defoe and
Stevenson and other masters of the ilk.

ETHEL
Just iook at this place.

 

   

 

Be all

   

Just take a ‘minute.
shipshape again.

She pulls off her jacket, puts on a marvelous, dilapi-
dated old thing and steps outside. Norman studies the
room, seemingly confused, as though staring at an old
friend he can't guite place. He wanders to the fish-
poles. .

“On the wall.is a ‘photo of Norman as a’ younger man hold-

ing two large fish. Norman stares at the picture.
Beside it is a clipping whose headline reads, “Profes-
sor Thayer Retires." It is dated 1966.

NORMAN

 

Norman wanders across the room. We SEE an aluminum .
canoe near the porch door,the name "Gertrude" emblazed
on its bow °

 

Norman opéns the wooden front door. He pushes the
screen door, but instead of swinging open, it falls
over onto the porch. Norman regards it for a moment,
then steps back into the living room.

 

He looks~about? He lifts a dust cover and finds a
fifties-style telephone on a small table. He lifts the
receiver.and listens.

NORMAN
(continuing; calling)
The phone works!

At least I think it does.

No answer.

NORMAN

(continuing)
Who the hell is that? Hello? Who
is this?... The operator! What do
you want?... You called, you must
want something... Oh, wait a
minute. I did call you, but you
never answered... Well... How are
you?... How nice. Listen. This
is Norman Thayer, Jr. over on
Golden Pond, and I have something
I'd like you to do. Call me up.
Can you do that?... I want to
check my phone and make certain it
still rings. It hasn't been rung
all winter, and it may have lost
its whatsis. Do you have ny
mumber?... I have no idea, it has
a nine in it, that's all I know...
Well, it's in the book, you must
have a book... Norman Thayer, Jr.
Let's give it a try, shall we?

Norman hangs up. He stares at the Phone expectantly.
A moment passes. He squints at the photo.

NORMAN

Who the hell is that?

We HEAR a KNOCK at the DOOR. Norman is startled, He
calls to the kitchen.

NORMAN

Someone's at the door!

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY . 23

Ethel marches in, Norman follows. He watches while she
dumps her load of logs, and straightens up a bit.

ETHEL

Norman, it's so beautiful.
Everything's just wating up.
Little tiny birds, little tiny
leaves. I saw a whole patch of
little tiny flowers out by the old
cellar hole. 1 forgot what they're
called, little tiny yellow things.

NORMAN
What were you doing out there in
the woods? °

Getting firewood, what do you think

Norman tries on another hat.

NORMAN
What do you think of this one?

ETHEL :
Quite a sight. Oh, no, poor Elmer
has had a terrible fall.

NORMAN
Who's poor Elmer?

ETHEL
Elmer, my dolly. He fell into the
fireplace.

NORMAN
Well, he should be more careful.

ETHEL
Poor little Elmer. The life you've
had. Did you know he turned sixty-
five this spring?

NORMAN
No, I must say I wasn't aware of
that.

He tries on more hats, one of which he'll wear for the
vest of the scene.

ETHEL
My father got him for me on my
fourth birthday. I wanted a red
scooter, but my father said red
scooters were excessive and
contrary to the ways of the Lord.
He told me I'd understand when I
got older. Well, I'ma lot older
now and I'm afraid I still don't
understand. But he gave me Elmer.
And Elmer and I, the times we've
had. He was my first true love,
you know.

NORMAN
I've known all along I wasn't the
first in line.

ETHEL
No, you were a rather cheap
substitute for my darling Elmer.
and now he's had a fall, poor

Maybe he was trying to kill himself.
Maybe he wants to be cremated.
Probably got cancer or termites
or something.

ETHEL
Are you hungry, darling?

NORMAN
No. It wouldn't be a bad way to go,
huh? A quick front flip off the
mantel, a bit of a kick at the
last minute, and end up right in
the fire. Nothing to it.

ETHEL °
Shut up, Norman!

NORMAN
When my number's up, do that for
me, would you? Prop me up on the
mantel and point out which way is
down, I may even try for a full
gainer with a half twist.

ETHEL
Norman Thayer, will you shut up?
Your fascination with dying is
beginning to frazzle my good humor.

NORMAN
It's not a fascination. It just
crosses my mind now and then.

ETHEL
Every five minutes. Don't you have
anything else to think about?

NORMAN
Nothing quite as interesting.

ETHEL
Well, what's stopping you? Why
don't you take your dive and get
it over with? See what it's Like?

regain his breath. He lifts the receiver,

NORMAN
Hello? Who is this?... The
operator! What do you want?...
Oh, to check the ring. Of course.
Does it work?

EXT. PORCH - DAY 27

Norman carries the phone onto the porch and watches as
Ethel gathers up paddles and cushions, puts the binoc-
ulars around her neck and carries them all down to the
canoe.

NORMAN
Yes, I guess it did ring here.
Thank you... I beg your pardon?,..
Oh. Thank you.

He hangs up the phone and leaves it on the porch. He
eutles down the bank shaking his head.

NORMAN
You ran into someone else? The
woods are full of people. What's
this place coming to?

ETHEL
It was only Charlie.

Who's Charlie?

ETHEL
Charlie, Norman. The mailman. He

NORMAN
I'1L put in the dock.
ETHEL
You won't put in the dock.

Because you're too old.

Chelsea had such a crush on him.
Remember, Norman?

NORMAN
Yes. I could never understand
that.

He pulls himself up and studies the beached float,

NORMAN

(continuing)
Remember Chelsea trying to be on
the diving team at school? Ha,
ha, ha,

(he holds out

his hands)
She was about this wide.

He climbs up on the diving board. He may take a jump
or two while they talk.

ETHEL
Tsk. She wasn't any such thing.
She had a few fat years, that's
all. :

NORMAN
I should say so. It's no wonder
she could never do a back flip.
No center of gravity.

ETHEL
Well,she tried... She only did it
to please you, anyway.

NORMAN
I know.

ETHEL
Oh, Norman. Wouldn't it be nice
if I could persuade her to come
and spend a few days this summer?

First ride of the year.

NORMAN
It's a little cold for that sort
of thing, isn't it?

ETHEL
Come on.

She pushes the canoe into the water and holds the bow.
He hesitates, but finally begins to climb in. The
canoe rocks and Norman stumbles.

NORMAN
Good God.

ETHEL
Well, watch yourself.

NORMAN

I think you're trying to kill me.

ETHEL
I've thought about it.
At last he settles in. Ethel hands him a paddle, then
climbs aboard, and they're off.

29 EXT. LAKE - LATE AFTERNOON 29
Norman and Ethel in the canoe. She is paddling ener-
getically in the bow. He igs faking it in the stern.

The canoe, consequently, is veering crookedly.

He tries a little harder. The canoe glides along by
other cottages.

ETHEL
Charlie says he doesn't expect Miss
Appley to make it up this summer.

NORMAN
Who's Miss Appley?

ETHEL
Miss Appley, Norman, who lives in
there a Miss Tate. They're both
in their nineties. They were up
here together when I was a teenager.
Wearing their neckties, and singing
in the gazebo, Holding hands,
What a marvelous love affair, if
that's what it is.

NORMAN
Yes.
ETHEL
Can you imagine being together so
long?
NORMAN
No.

ETHEL
Thanks a lot. Charlie says Miss
Appley is just too frail and Miss
Tate won't come without her. It's
sad, isn't it?

NORMAN
Yes.

Norman and Ethel paddle up the shore. A fish breaks

the water.

ETHEL
Norman! Look at the fish! My
word, It's going to be a good
summer. My father always said if
the fish start jumping in May it's
a good sign. We'll have to go to

NORMAN
No point in wasting the money.
You'd think they'd give the
license free to an old case like
me. It's not as though I'd come
out here and deplete the entire
bass population or anything. -

ETHEL
You always catch your share. You
always have,

NORMAN
Well, that's all behind me now.

ETHEL
All right, Norman.

They paddle without speaking for a moment. Suddenly
Ethel's attention is caught by something. She shrieks.

ETHEL

Norman!
NORMAN
Good God! What is it?

The loons! I've spotted the Loons!

She scrambles back in the canoe to retrieve the
binoculars.

black. They swim close to each other.

ETHEL

A husband and a wife. I think
they're looking at us.

NORMAN
Yes. They are.

He waves.

ETHEL
They're talking.

saying. Can you read beaks?

ETHEL
Look! They're kissing. My word.

They do indeed seem to be kissing. But suddenly they
lock around, wary. We HEAR the SOUND of a MOTORBOAT,

Norman hates it, But he's pleased, He rises, takes a
deep breath and blows out the candles, Everyone
applauds.

NORMAN in

I suppose you expect me to sing
something now. Well, I'm not
about to. I've been trying all
day to draw some profound
conclusion about living four score
years. And I haven't thought of
anything. I'm surprised I got
here so fast.

(he_looks at Ethel)
But I am glad I got to spend so
much time with this beautiful
woman. What's your name again?

He smiles as Ethel shakes her head. He turns to the
others.

NORMAN
(continuing)
And I certainly want to thank all
of your people for coming all the
way here from Disneyland to
witness this historic event.

EXT, THAYER DOCK - DAY 81
Bill stands in his designer jeans and Lacoste shirt and

Adidas, proudly watching Chelsea backstroking smoothly
toward the float. Charlie's boat appears.

Bill, this is my old friend,
Charlie, the mailman.

Hi, there.

CHARLIE
Hullo.

Charlie reaches his hand to Chelsea.

CHARLIE

Want a ride? .

Chelsea smiles and steps into the boat. They move
slowly toward the dock.

BILL

So, you actually deliver the
mail by boat. What an incredible
tradition.

CHELSEA
Charlie is a legend on this lake.
He gets the mail through no matter
what. Isn't that right, Charlie?

Yuh, I guess so.

CHARLIE
Oh, yuh, in the winter I have a

nobody on the lake to deliver to
so I get done a lot faster.

Bill puts a foot up on Charlie's boat.

BILL
You've got a great setup here.
Well, you're a lucky man.

He helps Chelsea from the boat.

CHARLIE
(looking at Chelsea)
You're a lucky man, too,

BILL
Yes, I guess I am,

The bow of the boat ig now drifting from the dock.
Bill finds himself being stretched.

BILL
(continuing)
Um. What do you do at a time like
this?
CHARLIE

I generally just fall into the
lake.
BILL

Oh, yes.
And he does. Charlie and Chelsea laugh. Chelsea pulls
Bill to her and kisses him. Charlie watches,
interested.

BILL
Hey, Chels, I'm a Parcheesi pro.
Chelsea nods.
NORMAN

Chelsea has never liked playing
games. We don't know why.
Probably she doesn't like losing.

CHELSEA
I tend to panic when the competition
is too intense.

NORMAN

And what is that supposed to mean?
CHELSEA

Nothing. :

punches the water. -

enormous plie of fish. Ethel can be seen in the b.g.

We caught eight million fish.
Are you sure none of these is

Yep. Watler is hummgus! Those

Can I ask you something? How did
you get Ethel anyway?

NORMAN
What? I sent away for her. Two
box tops from Quaker Oats.

BILLY
Don't bullshit me man...

NORMAN
I met Ethel when I was a principal
and she was a substitute teacher.
She was about the prettiest thing
I'd ever seen. So I told her she
made my heart go pitter-pat. She
fell in love with me immediately.

Ethel, having overheard the end of Norman's conversa-

Fortunately, the smart ones are too
smart to get caught. That's why
they're in schools... Ha, ha, ha!

Ethel and Billy share a look. She hands Norman the

They watch the loons.

Los Angeles or somewhere.

NORMAN
Yes.

ETHEL
Hello, Golden Pond. We've come
to say goodbye.

They stare out at the lake. The CAMERA DRAWS BACK and
we SEE Norman and Ethel, like the last summer flowers
on the shore. Solitary figures. Not sad, but peace-
ful and hopeful and proud. The CAMERA DRAWS BACK,
AWAY, ABOVE them. They become smaller and smaller,
but still visible and bright on the golden pond.

FADE OUT.
