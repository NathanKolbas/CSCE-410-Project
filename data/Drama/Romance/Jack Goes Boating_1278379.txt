MOVED TO A43 1
EXT. CLASSIC LIMO SERVICE PARKING LOT - DAY 2

A cold winter day. Jack and Clyde in separate limos pointed
in different directions parked side by side near the exit of
the lot. In background, Classic office. Clyde, Jack’s friend
and coworker, is well groomed, and wears a black limo suit --
a little better kept suit than Jack’s. Clyde passes a lit
joint from out his window to his friend. A reggae song,
Rivers of Babylon, is heard playing in Jack’s limo on an old
style tape portable player.

CLYDE
You thought about it?

JACK
(mervous throat clearing)
A-hem...

CLYDE
(after a pause)
«+I think you should.

JACK
What's she do there?
CLYDE
She’s the assistant to the
embalmer.
JACK
Aw, no...
CLYDE
..+.something with the fluids.
JACK
No, aw....
CLYDE

No, man. Lucy's training her to
sell seminars for Dr. Bob.

JACK
Phone sales?

CLYDE
He does seminars for the funeral
directors.
JACK
I thought he was just an
undertaker.

Jack passes the joint back through his car window to Clyde,
who takes a final toke and discards the ends.

CLYDE
She calls the funeral directors.
Phone sales.

JACK
Cool. What's her name?
CLYDE
Connie. So, I‘1l tell Lucy it’s

on.

Jack sees a man, his uncle Frank, emerge from the office of
Classic and head their way.

JACK
(indicates Uncle Frank)
Here’s my Uncle. Don't mention it --

CLYDE

Hey.
JACK

That it's...y'know... because...
CLYDE

I won't.
JACK

He won't let it rest.
CLYDE

Not a word.
JACK

It's how he is...

Uncle Frank appears outside of Jack’s car window. He gives
the men a small wave and a knowing look.

UNCLE FRANK
Gentlemen.

You two talking about me?

JACK
No.

CLYDE
Only about the money we make you.

UNCLE FRANK
That’s allowed. Your lips to God’s
ears.

He turns and walks back toward the Classic office. Jack
turns up the volume on Rivers of Babylon. Listens with
serious appreciation. Jack detects a warble in the tape.

JACK
The tape's getting stretched.
CLYDE
You should go CD.
JACK
Probably.
CLYDE

Go high tech.

JACK
Yeah.

Clyde observes Jack mouthing the words.

CLYDE
Jack. Turn it down a minute.

Jack turns it down.
CLYDE (CONT'D)
Would you call yourself a rasta

man?

JACK
No.

CLYDE
You thinking of becoming one?

JACK
No.
CONTINUED:

Clyde drives off. Jack listens to the song a moment, drives

away.

CLYDE
I just wanted to ask.

JACK
You like the song? Reggae's mainly
positive.

CLYDE
Some of the words, you know, I
don't get, so it's hard to commit.

JACK

"Over I" is a hard one.
CLYDE

“Over I?"
JACK

"Over I," yeah.

CLYDE
We'll just order something and hang
out.

JACK
Yeah.

CLYDE
No biggie.

INT/EXT. JACK’S LIMO - DAY

Jack drives. Italian woman in rear. Boxes and bags of
purchases. The Italian woman is on her cell phone, talking in
Italian. Her short talk is punctuated by the names of high
end clothing stores, Barneys, etc. She hangs up, with kisses.

After a moment--

ITALIAN WOMAN
You drive long time?

JACK
Yeah.

ITALIAN WOMAN
You married?

car pulls up, and behind it, Clyde’s limo is in line, ready
to deliver his passengers.

CUT TO:
INT. CLYDE’S LIMO - NIGHT 6
Clyde eyes the happy couple in the back seat from the vantage
of the rear view mirror. A young daughter of five between
them. She has an extravagantly wrapped present on her lap,
and is playing with the bow.

DADDY

Leave the pretty bow alone,
sweetie.

enter the hotel.

CLYDE

Can I get a minute, I got to run to
the men’s room?

VALET
Pull it out of the way. And don’t
be all day.

CLYDE

Thanks.

He hustles into the limo to pull it out of the way.

CUT TO:

An attendant stands by the opulent wash basins. Clyde
finishes at a urinal and moves to wash his hands. The
attendant offers Clyde a squeeze of a French hand soap from a
fancy looking bottle. Clyde washes his hands. The attendant
smiles and readies a towel. Clyde dries his hands. After
another moment of the two men looking at one another, more or
less expressionless, Clyde takes some change out of his
pocket.

ATTENDANT
No coins.

The attendant steps back. Clyde puts a buck in a tip bowl and
exits.

well-dressed arrivals for the event sip cocktails and chat
with each other near a pianist playing appropriate music. A
trolley of desserts passes Clyde. Guests part to make way for
it. A very tall pastry chef in white is revealed giving
directions on the placement of the desserts. Clyde observes
the man. After a moment, young woman with a guest list
approaches Clyde. Her smile hides her obvious opinion that
Clyde doesn’t belong.

EVENT ASSISTANT
May I help you?

CLYDE
No. No.

Clyde heads for the exit.

the nation. She gives one a thumbs up as she takes a
confirmation slip from her and moves on by --

LUCY
Someone's getting the bonus.

Lucy walks to the open office door to Dr. Bob’s office. Dr.
Bob dips into view as he gives Lucy a quick congratulatory
hug. At the same time, he looks over at Connie, struggling at
the phone.

DR BOB
What’s the verdict?

LUCY
The jury’s still out.

Lucy turns and crosses to Connie’s work area.

CONNIE
Well, Dr. Bob's not here, right
this minute, but I...

LUCY
(quietly emphatic)
Credit Card.

CONNIE
The new seminar experience offers
techniques-- that’s right--
“violent acts... The pain of sudden
deaths--” I did?

LUCY
Credit Card.
CONNIE
Oh, ah-- Mr. Pendecker?

JACK
Aw, that's...

OK to go, that he didn't have to
stick around. I told him I loved
him, and that he was a great dad,
that he was free to go to heaven.

Two days later, he woke up out of
the coma.
CLYDE
Fuck.

like... y'know... I thought he's in
like a zombie state. Not like Dawn
of the Dead, but a zombie state
where you stay around because
there's some unfinished business
you're responsible for-- like
taking care of my mom.

JACK
Yeah, your mom, of course...

CONNIE
He went back to be with her at
Sunshine Valley Care Facility.

JACK
God, that's... got up from a coma
and went home.

Fifty-two? Unbelievable... I mean,
I believe it, but, wow, fifty-two
years.

She was blind. She couldn't walk,

near the end. She was blind but
she'd look in the air like she was
seeing them. I don't know what,
y'know... I asked if she was afraid
to die and she said, no, but that
she'd rather not. The bathroom's
back there?

CONNIE
No, really, it’s... It’s alright.

This is plenty. I liked tonight.
They walk a few moments in silence.

CONNIE ALT
Winter. Boating.

JACK
Yeah.

They continue in silence. Jack observes Connie with the snow
falling on her. She looks at him, and he turns away shyly,
searches the street for a cab. He sees a cab and steps out
to stop it. The cab pulls over and he opens the door. She
gets part way in and then impulsively plants an awkward kiss
on his cheek and practically stumbles back into the cab,
which takes off. Jack stands in the aftermath of the kiss, a
kind of slam-kiss.

summer.

CLYDE
Five years ago I said I’d teach
you.

LUCY

He taught me.

JACK
You said it caused problems to
teach someone you're close to...so,
when you asked, later, I thought,
you know, I don't think so.

CLYDE

By summer, you'll be going away
together for weekends to a lake
that rents boats. Boating at night.
In the moonlight. Huh? Under the
stars.

JACK
I should learn.

CLYDE
We'll go to the pool uptown. State
of the art, ozone filtration.

JACK
Heated?

CLYDE
I'm serious.

JACK
I'm serious.

It'll get me back going. I used to
go three, four times a week.

That's good, but...Jack. That's

bubbles under the water, then come
up, take a breath, and go under,
bubbles, come up, and get a rhythm
going. Breath, under, bubbles, up.

You'll get used to it. We'll do it

Crowded car. Jack looks across at the MTA EMPLOYMENT poster.
His expression turns more critical. He locates the sound of
loud chewing and the source of his distraction: a seated
subway rider eats potato chips from a bag -- crunching
loudly, obliviously-- chips falling on his belly and on to
the floor of the car. Jack raises the earphones, presses the
button on an older style portable tape player.

She feels a man uncomfortably close, pressing up against her.
She squeezes through the crowd. Their eyes meet. She looks
away. She looks back to see the man has moved closer in her
direction. He’s got a bleary smile on his ruddy mug; drunk?
a psycho? He keeps moving closer to her.

Even when they know he's gay. Shit
goes on in funeral homes. I’m not
saying it doesn’t. There was a
grief counselor worked here, a
total narcissist pig, but really

Elbow up, tease the water with the
fingers and stab the water. This
arm pulls back, this one thrusts

thrust, slicing in.

Jack goes into action. Ugly but dedicated.

CANNOLI (CONT’D)
You didn’t notice?

JACK
Ahem.

The Cannoli reveals the finger that was folded out of view. A
joke. Smiles. His mobile rings. He answers.

CANNOLI
This is Federic.

Hello. Yes. Hold on.

INT. CLYDE & LUCY’S APARTMENT OUTER HALLWAY - NIGHT 157
The door is forced slightly open by Lucy during the struggle.

LUCY
I want to see...

An inch. Two inches. Her face is visible as she sees the
Cannoli.

LUCY (CONT'D)
Federic?

The door is forced shut.
CUT TO:
INT. CLYDE AND LUCY’S APT 158

Jack is mortified as he watches Lucy and Clyde struggle at
the door.

You called him?

JACK
The Cannoli?

The cooking guy.

LUCY
Let him in.

Clyde has his arms around Lucy as she kicks and struggles.

CLYDE
I’m sorry... I....

The door is ajar. The Cannoli is seen looking in. Clyde backs
forcibly against the door to force it shut while tightly
holding the struggling Lucy.

LUCY
You fucking asshole! Let go of me.
CLYDE
Let me explain.
CONNIE
Let her go.
JACK

Maybe let’s, if we...
Lucy manages to pull the door opened slightly.

THE CANNOLI (0.S.)
Is everything OK?

JACK
I’1ll talk, hem, to him...

CLYDE
(shouts )
Yes everything is fucking OK.

Clyde forces the door shut. UNSEEN BY ALL the Cannoli’s hand
is painfully caught in the door before it disappears from
view.

LUCY
Let go.

CLYDE
I’m sorry.

Lucy struggles more intensely.

Lucy breaks free and stumbles across the room. Clyde moves,
utterly defeated and humiliated, away from the door.

JACK
Ahem.... hem... stop fighting.

CUT TO:
INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT 161

The Cannoli is bee-lining it away, nursing his squashed
fingers.

Lucy, clothes totally awry, glares at Clyde.

LUCY
You called the fucking Cannoli.

JACK

Lucy moves down the hall to the stairs.

You wanted to totally fuck up a
perfectly good time with friends.

CLYDE
I was going to be OK with it.

LUCY
To totally embarrass me. Asshole.

CLYDE
No, because, I’ve grown. I wanted
to show I’ve grown.

LUCY
You are so fucked up. God. OK. OK.
Forget it.

Lucy leans in to hiss in Clyde’s ear.

She turns

LUCY
We're done.

LUCY
Forget it. OK. OK?
CONNIE
Yeah, uh-huh.
JACK
Yeah. Ahem...hem. Ahem...hem...
LUCY
Put on the lights. Put the lights

back on.

They put the lights on.

CLYDE
I’m sorry... you’re right, I fucked
up.

LUCY

This didn’t happen. Just forget it.

Asshole.

Lucy gulps a big swig of brandy.

CLYDE
I wanted to be normal with the
Cannoli. I‘1ll never be normal. I’m
a little ant opening car doors that
has to be extra polite just to be
liked by anyone!

LUCY
Quit feeling sorry for yourself,
loser.

JACK
I like you.

CONNIE
Jack likes you.

CLYDE
I know Jack likes me!

JACK
Don’t...hem... yell at her.

Jack becomes more and more paralyzed by the intensity of the
collapse of his friends’ relationship.

CLYDE
I’m fucked up and you’1l look for
some other life in some other
person. Someone brilliant with
pastries, or with death, like the
death guy!

LUCY
Don’t embarrass yourself!

CLYDE
You think I’m nothing.

LUCY
You’re fucking nothing! That’s what
you want? You’re fucking nothing.

JACK
You guys, Ahem, hem... hem...

CLYDE

You love I fucked someone. Piece of

Save it for someone who cares!

WHAT, JACK? What is it you want to
say about your asshole friend?

CONNIE
Don’t yell at him.

JACK
Ahem.... It’s...

LUCY

I told you what I did and you
couldn’t stop wanting to fuck me

all night!
JACK

CLYDE

I never lied to you!

LUCY
And I never told you everything!
You’re right. You’re nothing.
You’1l always be nothing!

Nothing!

She exits. Bedroom door is slammed shut. Jack’s nervous
throat ratchets up.

CLYDE
Oh, fuck, oh, man.

He exits after Lucy.
CLYDE (CONT'D)
(off)
Lucy. Lucy! Open the door!
Pounding on door. Connie finds the portable tape player and
punches it on to play Babylon as she takes it to Clyde. Jack
implodes barely able to “ahem...”
CUT TO:
165 INT. HALL - NIGHT 165
Connie puts the portable recorder playing Babylon next to
Clyde who is still pounding on the door. Clyde hurls the tape
player blindly away. It whizzes past Connie.
CUT TO:
166 INT. FRONT ROOM - NIGHT 166

The portable tape player crashes and falls to the floor where
it pathetically plays on with severely distorted sound.

JACK
.--hem... oh, no...

Connie enters.

CONNIE
We're going!

CLYDE (0.S.)
Let me in. Let me fucking in!

CONNIE
We're going.

Pounding on off screen door.

Lucy stands in the tub. Clyde looks at her from the
destruction of the door. He moves to her.

CLYDE
I’m sorry...

LUCY
I hate you.

He steps into the tub.

CLYDE
I’m sorry...

LUCY
I hate you.

He tries to hold her.

LUCY (CONT'D)
Let me go. Let me fucking go!

She starts out of the bathroom. Stops. She turns to him,
calm, weary.

It’s over. You know it. I know it.
Over.

She leaves the room. The reality that this was a truth he
somehow knew overcomes him, and he stands in the tub, looking
after her but seeing nothing.

CUT TO:
INT. CAB - NIGHT 168

Jack and Connie look battle shocked. He puts his hand on
hers, and she holds it without looking at him.

CUT TO:
INT. CONNIE’S APT - NIGHT 169

Connie enters and goes to the sink and turns on the water,
just to have something to do. Jack follows her in. There’s a
box from the store that contained her new dress on the bed.
Other signs of getting ready for the dinner are about. Make
up, scarves, another pair of new shoes, etc. She shuts off
the tap. The strain finally works its way to her feelings,
and she wipes at her eyes. He steps towards her, stops.

JACK
Y’know...? I mean... That was...
CONNIE
My nerves are rattling.
JACK
Maybe I should go.
CONNIE
No.
JACK
OK.
CONNIE

You could hold me.

JACK
OK.

They are holding on tight in silence.

CONNIE
My heart’s pounding.

JACK
I know.

They hold one another in silence.

CONNIE
I don't want it ever to be like

No. Uh-uh...

That's why I'm standing here with
you.

JACK
This feels good now. Better.

CONNIE
Jack?

JACK
Yeah?

CONNIE
If you took me--

JACK
Huh?

CONNIE
Took me.

JACK
Took you?

CONNIE

Over power me.

I pictured the first time by the

but it could just be now-- if you
overpower me.

JACK
Overpower you?

CONNIE
Force me, in a way--

JACK
Oh.

CONNIE
Make me.

JACK
Make you?

CONNIE

Hold me down, and take off my

clothes, and don’t hurt me, but
overcome me.

Yeah?

Yeah.

He suddenly and forcefully backs her up and down on the bed.

JACK
You alright?

CONNIE
(breathless)
You're strong.

JACK
Swimming practice.

CONNIE
You're good at it, I’1l bet.

JACK
Getting there.

Good, see, you're swimming. That's

right. Good. Good. I'm coming in.

Oh, yeah.
Clyde dives in, surfaces, and swims in the lane alongside
Jack. He passes him, turns on his back and swims that way
watching Jack.

CLYDE
Oh, yeah!

He turns and resumes swimming toward the end of the pool,
flips and starts back--

Connie walks toward the pool building. Jack and Clyde come
out of the building. The three stand talking briefly before
Connie and Jack move away toward the parking lot. Clyde
starts off, turns and looks back at them. As he watches them

we hear in V.O.:

JACK (V.0O.)
OK?

CONNIE (V.O.)
Yeah.

JACK (V.0.)
Don't worry.

CONNIE (V.O.)
OK.

JACK (V.O.)
I'm a good swimmer.

CAMERA PANS away from Clyde to the trees exterior of the pool

and rises to the blue cloudless sky.
