six stories high, built at different times in the last fifty

The barman draws a beer.
MATT

can talk again in the morning,

MATT
Fine. Thanks for this.
BREEN
What we're here for. Matthew?
MATT
Yes?
BREEN

From what you've said, I'm surprised
you care go much about seeing your
father. About seeing him at ali.

MATT
He's holding something for me.

Breen ts pleased to have this motivation cleared up.

BREEN
Ah.
25

JANINE enters. Mid-twonties, good-looking, very pale,
conservatively dressed, both demure and aloof. ‘

BREEN
Janine, this is Matthew Bailey,
he'll be staying with us for a
day or so.

JANINE
All right, Father.

BREEN :
Matthew, Janine actually runs this
establishment.
She's pleased at the compliment, but doesn't look at Matt.
MATT
(best behavior)
How are you?
She still doesn't look at him.

JANINE
Fine, thank you. Nice to meet you,

BREEN
Would you show Matthew down?

JANINE

Yea. Then I'm off.
BREEN

Fine. Good night, Matthew.
MATT

Good night, father.
Janine leads Matt out. Breen ponders,
INT. HALL ~ NIGHT

Dim lit, furnished with benches and tables and unlit lamps
and religious paintings. Janine leads Matt.

MATT
What are you doing here?

JANINE
(facing forward)
I'm the housekeeper. I don't live
here, I live over in the halfway
house.
MATT

(kidding) ny
Halfway between what and what?

JANINE
(considers; then)
Between good girl and bad girl,

MATT
Which way you moving?

She looks sideways at him. She's not friendly,

JANINE
Away from men like you.

He laugha, and raises defensive hands, admitting defeat.

MATT
Q-kay.

JANINE
It's down here,

She opens a door. She reaches in, switches on a light, and
a@ simple staircase, with wooden walls, leads downward. She
starta down, he follows.

INT. DORMITORY - NIGHT

Pitch black. The door opens, so that Matt and Janine ure
silhouetted in the rectangle of light. She hita a light
awitch and very bright ceiling fluorescents come on. It's
a fairly large room, Spartan, with six single beds widely
spaced. Hach bed comea with a low dresser, a table lamp
atop it, and @ metal folding chair.

JANINE
(pointing)
The bathroom's through there.
You're the only one here now.

Matt dislikes the coldness and the whiff of institution.

MATT
I'm aurprised. You'd think there'd
be @ run on this place.

JANINE
(deadpan)
The price ia right. Good night.

MATT
Good night.
27

She leaves, He looks around in dtataste. He moves through
the room, selects the bed nearest the middle, switches o
the lamp there. He goes back to the door to switch off’ the
overhead fluorescents. Now the room is dim, except for the
cone of amber light around that one bed. He crosses back
to it, sits on the side of the bed, looks around at the
other beds in the gloom. Very faintly, COUGHING, SNORING
and muttered CONVERSATIONS can be heard. They fade away.
He keeps looking around, grin.

EUGENE (VO)

He doesn't like this. It wasn't
supposed to be like this. He was
Supposed ta be in the Plorida Keys
by now, with all the money in the
world. Now he feels like a charity
patient, I know my boy; he won't
take this for long.

Matt looks around at the empty beds, eyes glinting. SLOW FADE.
INT, BREAKFAST ROOM - DAY

In the rectory, A small fugsy room with three two-person
tables laid for breakfast, and a sideboard with juloe,
coffee, rolls, little boxes of cereal, Standing at the
sideboard ia BUSTER FLYNN, 60ish, a ruined big man with
heavy round shoulders, heavy forward-thrust head, An
ex-boxer, punchdrunk, he steadily bobs and weaves ag he
considers hia breakfast. He could be Grooving to inner
music, or he could be evading punches,

Matt enters, reacts cautiously to Buster. Buster sees hin
and starts at once ta TALK. Buster's speech is rhythmic,
like his movements, but almost spastic, out of control.

BUSTER
Oh, yea. Oh, yea. You were here,
Last night.

Matt crosses to the sideboard, not too close to Buster.

MATT
That's right.

BUSTER
Not me. Not me, I couldn't come,
(confidential; quiet elation)
I saw the lady,

MATT
Ts that right?
28

Buster is ecstatic. Huge smile, tears in his eyes, he

gazes skyward,

BUSTER
She's so beautiful.

Matt pours Juice and coffee and chooses a roll,

BUSTER
(down a little)
Not like the first time, though.

MATT
That's probably true.

Buster's ecstatic again, vemembering the first time. He
gazes upward, opens his arms like 4 flower opening.

BUSTER
In the sunlight! Up in the air}
With all the smoke and the noise,
and she was so beautiful.
(confidential; beaming)
She smiled at me,

MATT
That's good.

Matt crosses to a table with his breakfast, sits.

Janine enters,

BUSTER ”
Sometimes I see her. Never like
the first time. That was real,
Now it's like ghosts.

smiles impersonally at them both,

JANINE
Good morning.

BUSTER
Oh, Janine. You know.

JANINE
(indulgent smile)
Yes, I know, Buster. Hava you two
met?

MATT
Informally,
29

JANINE
Matthew Bailey, Buster Flynn, ,
Buster points at Matthew, happy to have his name, as though
it's a nut he's going to carry away and store.

BUSTER
Matthew.

MATT
(polite, uninterested)
How are you, Buster? -

JANINE
Buster stays here sometimes. He
helps around the church.

BUSTER
(mimes it)
Heavy lifting.

MATT
Buster's been telling me about the
beautiful lady,

BUSTER
(happy; pointing out)
She's there,

MATT
I thought he might be meaning you,

Janine ignores the compliment in that, responds seriously.

JANINE
No, I think he means the Virgin
Mary.

BUSTER

She smiled at me. In the sun.
With 811 the smoke.

JANINE
Buster, Father Breen wants you to
ride with him to the co-op this
morning. Can you do that?

Buster's happy to have a jab,

BUSTER
Oh, yes.

He moves toward the door, happily pointing at Matt.
He exits.

She crosses to

JANINE
You slept well?

MATT
(dismissive shrug)
When I slept. I wonder if you
could help me with something.

JANINE
If I can.

She sits across from him. He takes the slip of paper from

his pocket.

MATT
The management firm over at forty-
five, they're an outfit called
Shipfer, Hallows, Crescent. I
need an address,

JANINE
Why?

MATT
I want to talk to them, find out
when my father moved, did he leave
@n address,

JANINE

Give me that, let me see what Tr
ean find.

MATT
(handing her slip)
I appreciate it.

JANINE

Part of the service.

She risea and leaves the room. He eats hia breakfast,

EXT, COURT ST. - DAY “

Brooklyn, The County Court House faces office buildings
across the broad street.

EUGENE (VO)
Court Street, Brooklyn, where all
the real estate sharks in New York
come to swim. ‘The owners, the
lawyers, the managers, the agents,
they're all here, and they're all
hungry. There's always blood in
the water on Court Street.

Matt walks around the corner INTO VIEW. He comes partway
down the block, enters an office building.

INT, JULIUS'S OFFICE - DAY

A mid-level executive office, spacious but not a corner,
sofa but not a seating area, At his desk, reading a
printout, 1a JULIUS, black-haired, balding, shadow-bearded,
40ish, muscular, mean. SOUND of knock on door. He looks
up 48 & SECRETARY enters. She looks upset.

SECRETARY
Mr. Julius...
JULIUS
(impatient)
Yea.
SECRETARY

Sir, there's 4 man out here, we
think, maybe you should deal with
hin,

JULIUS
Why? Who 1s he?

SECRETARY
Apparently, his father's a former
tenant. But he's asking questions--
We're not supposed to give out
that information,

JULIUS
Tell him so.

SECRETARY
(hushed)
Well. He's rather. . . intimidating.
32

Julius takes this as a challenge,

JULIUS “-
Oh, he 18, 43 he? Send him in.

SECRETARY
Thank you, sir,

She exits. Julius girds himself, shifting in his chair,

touching objects on the desk, Matt enters, closing the
door behind himself,

MATT
Mr. Julius?

JULIUS
(tough)
That's right. I'm told--

With a friendly smile, Matt marches toward the desk, hand
atuck out for a shake.

MATT
I'm Matt Balley. I apprectate you
taking the time for me,

Julius automatically puts his own hand out. Matt atops
just short of the desk, his hand not quite close enough.
Julius ia already 1n the motion, and haa to awkwardly rise
to lean forward and grasp his hand. Both ahake firmly but

briefly, and Julius drops back into his chair as Matt takes
the chair facing him.

MATT
Your people out there were very
good, they do their job, they're
right to be cautious, I need to
speak to someone like you to find
out what I want to know.

Julius ia wary, hostile and impatient,

sULIUS
And what is that?

MATT
My father, Eugene Bailey, used to
be a tenant in a building you manage,

Julius turns to his computer terminal, types in, studies,

JULIUS “+
Yes. It's been our account for
four years.

MATT
That's what they told me outside.
I think what I want is older.

JULIUS
Apparently the owner managed the
property before then.

That's what I want, that's what I
need. The name of the ower.

JULIUS
That's no problem.

Not a corporation, the owner,

JULIUS 7
There's a post office box number
here, you can write--

MATT
I can't talk to a post office box.
I need @ person. Like you,

JULIUS
Then that's why they couldn't help
you outside. That's the sort of
information wee=

Matt abruptly stands. He paces slowly in front of the desk.

Julius watches

him, warier.

MATT
You know, I used to be a violent
guy, but then I learned, most of
the time violence doesn't help.
Most of the time, violence makes
it worse, But every once ina
while, violence is the only thing
that will do the job.
34

Matt moves quickly around the desk. Startled, Julius
lunges for his phone. Before he gets to it, Matt chops
down, edge of the hand, into the corner where Julius! ~
throat and shoulder meet, Julius jerks backward, paralyzed

by pain, staring. Matt moves the telephone farther away,
stands over Julius.

MATT
It's amazing, really, how much pain
the body can take and not show a
thing. This, for instance,

Stepping to the side, hand rigid, he gives a short hard
jab into Julius's kidney. Julius arches his back, eyes
bulging, mouth open in a silent scream. Matt considera
him, nods his approval, goes back to sit down.

MATT
You'll be able to talk in a minute
or two, While we're waiting, let
me explain the situation. What
we're doing 1s confidential between
the two of us. I won't tell anybody
where I got the information you give
me, 4nd you won't mention to anybody
that I waa here,

Matt frowns at Julius, who's breathing now in short gasps.

MATT
There, it's better already. The
only thing I've got to mention, if
you ever tell anybody about this
meeting of ours, we're just gonna
have to have another meeting. You
ready now?

JULIUS
I-- I can't--

MATT
Sure you can. Take it slow and easy,
You followed what I said so far?

Julius nods,

MATT
Good, The owner's name,

JULIUS
(hoarse)
Alec Oberman,.
35

~ MATT
Alec Oberman. And his home addresa,

Julius hesitates. Matt leans toward hin, queationing:

Do
we have to start again?

JULIUS
You won't find him at home. If I
tell you--

MATT

I'll never repeat a word you aay.
No one will know it's from you.

JULIUS
And you won't--

MATT
(smile)
That's right, I won't have a reason
to come back,

Julius considers a second longer, breathing hard, then nods.

JULIUS
He's part owner of a nightclub,
the Blue Narcissus, in the Park
Avenue Hotel. The word is, he
loves it there. That's the one
place you're sure to find him.
At night.

MATT
Blue Narcissus in the Park Avenue
Hotel. Alec Oberman,
(stands)
Mr. Julius, I appreciate it. You've
been a great help. Don't get up,
I'll find my way.

Matt leaves, Julius's eyes on him. Julius leans forward,
pressing both forearms on the desk, easing some of the
pain. He breathes 4 bit, looking at the phone, then
reaches for the phone, and the movement gives him a new
spasm. Shocked, he pulls the arm back. His breathing ia
More ragged, he's sturing; then he calms down. He looks at
the phone; the desk; the phone; the deak. He hates it,

but he knows he isn't going to make the call. Moving
cautiously, he draws the printout closer, leana over it,
determinedly goes on with his reading.
36

EXT. PARK AVENUE - NIGHT

Matt comes walking up the avenue. He's dressed ag well’aa
possible, out of the duffel. A gray workshirt and a dark

thin tie. Dark slacks, a wrinkled dark sports jacket.
He looks ahead,

MATT'S POV: Marquee of the Park Avenue Hotel. cabs pulling

WIDE SHOT, the hotel, as Matt arrives and enters,
INT. LOBBY - NIGHT

Beige marble, dully gleaming. Vast low overstuffed aofas,
Persian carpets. Many elaborate floor lamps. Matt moves
through 1t, looking around,

AN ANGLE to show Matt in fg. In bg is a high wide oval
doorway in the side wall, topped by a blue neon signs
BLUE NARCISSUS. The corridor beyond the doorway is a
biank wall at an angle to the left, so from the lobby you

can't see far down it. Matt turns, sees the sign, crosses
to go through the doorway,

INT, BLUE NARCISSUS - NIGHT

At the maitre d's station. Four separate middle-aged
COUPLES wait for tables. Beyond the gtation, the place

is large, irregularly shaped, low-cellinged, dark, with
smell faux-candle lamps at every table. It's pretty full.

AN ANGLE on Matt, reaching the station, moving around
Behind the waiting couples, passing on the side, stopping
at the cheat-high wooden wall where the club begins. He
looks out at the place. MUSIC plays; gentle jazz.

MATT'S POVs Centered in the far wall ia a stage, thrust

out into the club space, surrounded on three sides by
tables. A TRIO plays on one side of the stage -- piano,
bass, guitar -~ illuminated by low spotlights. A microphone
on & stand is at the front of the stage,

AN ANGLE on Matt, looking the place over,
ANNOUNCER (VO)

Vivian Romero}

Scattered APPLAUSE. Surprised, Matt looks at the stage.
37

AN ANGLE on the stage, as a spotlight hits the microphone,
Vivian walks out, in a floor-length red gown, acknowledges
the applause. She speaks into the microphone. “

VIVIAN
I hope you're all feeling fine.

Positive RESPONSES from here and there.

VIVIAN
(smiling)
Good. And I hope you're still
feeling fine after this number,

She nods to the trio, then SINGS "Lush Life". She's good,
appropriate to this place.

AN ANGLE on Matt as the song ends, and an ASSISTANT
MAITRE D' approaches. He's proper, but firm.

MAITRE D'

Yea, gir? May I help you?
MATT

Yes. I'm looking for Aleo Oberman.
MAITRE D‘

He'll be in his office, sir.

MATT
Okay. In that case, I'm looking
for Alec Oberman's office,

MAITRE D'
You can't get to 1t through here,
Sir. You go back out to the lobby
and turn right, and it's the second
door. It's marked Narcissus
Associates.

MATT
Thank you.

Vivian has started to SING "Love For Sale". About to turn
away, Matt stops and nods toward her.

MATT
She's very good.

MAITRE D‘
Thank you, sir. We're very happy
to have her.
38

MATT
I can understand that.

INT. LOBBY - NIGHT

Matt comes from the nightclub, turns right to the second
door, 4 solid wood in the lobby's style, with Narciasaus

Associates on it in gold. Matt turns the knob, but the

door is locked. He looks, sees the small white button,

presses it.

RECEPTIONIST (VO)
(through intercom)
Yes?

Matt sees no grid. He speaks to the door,

MATT
For Alec Oberman,.

SOUND of buzzer, Matt pushes the door, It opens. He enters.
INT. RECEPTIONIST'S OFFICE ~ NIGHT

Small, quiet, tastefully decorated, Framed photographs of
performers on the walls. The RECEPTIONIST 1a a beautiful
pouty girl meant to be a model, She's more formal than
her appearance.

RECEPTIONIST
Ia Mr. Oberman expecting you?

MATT
I don't think so. Tell him it's
Matt Bailey. It's about nineteen
dash forty-five a Hundred sixty-
Third Row.

RECEPTIONIST
(picking up pen)
Again, please?

MATT
Nineteen dash forty-five a Hundred
Sixty-Third Row,

She writes it, then reaches for her phone.

RECEPTIONIST
Please have 4 seat,

Matt crosses to the seating area as she MURMURS into the

phone. He sits, and pokea through the magazines on the
coffee table.
39

RECEPTIONIST
He'll be with you in a moment.

MATT
Thank you.

Her phone BUZZES. She SPEAKS into it, listens, hangs up.
She rises and goes through the inner door,

INT, OBERMAN'S OFFICE - NIGHT

A wide room, expensively furnished. We SEE the left half
of it. ALEC OBERMAN, 50ish, Ivy League plus tough guy,
stands at a large plate glass window looking into the
nightclub, where the customers are now dancing. It's
obviously a two-way mirror, He draws a drape closed
acrosa it as the receptionist crosses to him.

OBERMAN
What's he like?

RECEPTIONIST
(indifferent shrug)
Constnuction worker.

OBERMAN
(to himself)
Construction and demolition.
(to ner)
Angry? Tense?

RECEPTIONIST
As calm as Sunday school,

He nods, dismissing her. Ag she crosses to the door, he
crosses to hia desk, picks up the phone.

INT. RECEPTIONIST'S OFFICE - NIGHT

She comes out, gives Matt & meaningless smile, sits at
her desk.

MATT
Going to be much longer?

RECEPTIONIST
Only a minute or two. He's
finishing a call,

The outer door buzzes, Without asking who it is, she buzzes
it open. Matt gets to his feet, expecting something.
40

DANNY enters; a very big guy, in a tux, a thug with a veneer.
He offers a friendly smile aa he walks toward Matt.

DANNY
Hi, I'm Danny, you must be Matt,

MATT
That's right.

DANNY
(atd11 smiling)
I'm sorry about this, but I'm gonna
have to frisk you now,

Matt returns his smile, and lifts his arma to the sides,

MATT
The @pology makes all the difference.

DANNY
(patting him down)
I found that to be true. Okay,
you're very clean, that'a nice.

MATT
Thank you.

DANNY
Come on in.

He leads the way to the inner door, Matt following. They
step through.

INT. OBERMAN'S OFFICE - NIGHT

We still SEE the left side of the office, where Oberman is
now seated at his desk; he rises when they come in. The
drape is closed over the plate glasa window.

OBERMAN
Mr. Bailey?

MATT
Mr. Oberman,

OBERMAN
I won't offer to shake hands, I'm

not sure we're going to be friends.
Have a seat,

MATT
Thank you,

Oberman sits behind his desk, Matt in one of two co
chairs in front of it, Danny off to the aide,

OBERMAN
You've been making confusing moves,
I'm not sure what you're about.

MATT

OBERMAN
Sounds like the start of an old
joke. Not & very good one,

MATT
If I know where he is, if I know
what happened to him, if I know

where his... things are, that's
all I want.

Oberman sits back, frowning, studying, thinking about Matt.

OBERMAN
Can it be possible you're legit?

MATT
Anything's possible.

OBERMAN
I know you're a career criminal. I
know you're just recently out of
prison. Naturally, I assumed somebody
hired you to make waves, but I just
couldn't figure out the scheme.

MATT
Scheme?

OB)
(intense)
What you're up to, just tell me. Does
it have something to do with the
election?

MATT
What election?

OBERMAN

(looks at Danny)
Jesus Christ, I believe hin.

(to Matt)
You've walked into somebody else's
game, my friend. Seven months from
now, we're going to have a mayoral
election.
42

MATT
Is that right.

OBERMAN
Happens every four years, whether
we like it or not. And every four
years, along around Auguat, we
get the real estate acandal.

MATT
I don't think I'm following you,

OBERMAN
Listen harder. In New York City,
politics and real estate are one
and the same. So the question
isn't, doea this politician take
money from the developers? The
question is, how many developers
have a leash on him, and which one
of those leashes is gonna be this
election year's August scandal. We
had a couple doozies last time around.

MATT
None of this has anything to do with me,

OBERMAN

Let me get used to that idea, It
might even be true. You know, you
walk in here with some agenda of
your own, I figure you're here to
make ordinary trouble. But maybe
you're here to make extraordinary
trouble, that's a new idea,

MATT
No trouble at all.

OBERMAN
You don't listen like you should.
What I'm telling you is, you aren't
@lone here. There's people out
there now would love to meet you,
find out what your problem is, buy
you a suit, use you to fuck me over,
and ny friends in real estate and
politica. Not everybody around here
is jolly campera all together. Some
people got enemies in this town,

MATT
Not ae,
43

OBERMAN
Fuck you. I'm talking about me.

MATT
Then you know beat.

OBERMAN
That's right. And I kmow better
than to leave you wandering around,
@ loose cannon.

MATT .
You're going to stop me?

OBERMAN
(exasperated)
I'm not a gangster, Mr. Bailey, I'm
@ businessman. There are perfectly
legal ways to deal with a bum like
you, believe me,

MATT
I'm sure there are. Are you gonna
60 on threatening me @ while longer,
or can I get to my question now?

OBERMAN
You c&nnot get to your question now.
Or later. I don't give a shit what
your question 1a. TI only know you're
drawing attention to yourself in a
neighborhood where I don't want
trouble, and that's all I need to
know. You want to look for your
father next year, that's fine with
me. This year, I can't have anomalies,
So I'll offer you one solution,

MATT

(apparently happily surprised)
A solution,

OBERMAN
I've got friends in Chicago, in
banking mostly, there might be a job
for you. A little travel money from
me, an introduction to my friends,
and if you want to come back next
year, then I'll shake your hand and
look at pictures of you in the back
yard with your father and your dog
Shep and see what I can do to help.
But not this year,

OBERMAN

Or we do something else that doesn't

you're out of my hair just as well.

MATT
Can I think this over?

OBERMAN
How long?

the question, smiles absently at Danny, nods.

MATT
Tomorrow night. That soon enough?
If I come in here tomorrow night,
I want to see Chicago.

OBERMAN
And 1f you don't?

MATT
I want to see New York,

OBERMAN
Not an option. But all right, fine,
take tomorrow, keep a low profile,
I'll have tickets and money and
names for you tomorrow night.

You're a generous guy, Mr. Oberman.

OBERMAN
Money, I've found, anawersa most

better than an answer,

MATT
I'll think about that, too.
See ya, Danny.

Danny smiles, gives a half-aalute,

DANNY °
We'll see you, Matt.

AN ANGLE for the first time to snow the right side of the
room, which has been behind Matt. Centered on the wall,
in pride of place, ig the portrait of the womun we've
seen before. Matt turns, sees 1t, stops dead.

AN ANGLE close on Matt, startled, emotional, disconcerted.

WIDE SHOT. Oberman frowns at Matt's back, sensing something
has happened.

OBERMAN
Bailey?

AN ANGLE with Matt in fg, Oberman and Danny in bg, 4s Matt
gets himseif under control, manages a smile, turns back,

MATT
I was surprised by . . . by that
picture there. That's really a
wonderful picture,

OBERMAN
You're an art lover? That
surprises me.

MATT
(waving that off) .
No, no, no I'm not. It's just that
picture. It really grabs you.

Oberman smiles. He's proud and pleased to have that picture.

OBERMAN
I agree. It's one my favorite
possessions. A good friend gave
it to me.

Matt studies the picture. He's re-familierizing himself with
it, and he's also immunizing himself, so he won't show the
wrong emotions.

MATT
That's some friend.
(nods back at them)
See you around,

He exits. Oberman and Danny look at one another. Oberman

The barman returns to his other customers. Conversation

EXT. 163RD ROW - NIGHT

Matt comes out of the deli eating 4 sandwich, carrying a
small white paperbag, He reacts when he sees Wygand's
black car stopped at the curb there. The three cops are
in it, as before. None of them look at Matt, who walks
down the block, eating his sandwich,

AN ANGLE near the church aa Matt walks toward at. Behind
him, the car moves along the curb, pacing hin, staying
well back, Matt finishes his sandwich as he turns in at
the rectory, He doesn't look back.

AN ANGLE on the rectory door as he rings the bell. The
car stops at the curb out front.

Janine opens the door. She's a little surprised,
JANINE
Good evening. You want to atay
again?
MATT
(entering )
Maybe.
She looks past him, frowna at the car at the curb.

JANINE
What's that?

INT. HALL - NIGHT
She closes the door and turns to him.

MATT
I must smell bad, I'm drawing cops.

JANINE

Those are police? Why are they
following you?
MATT
(waving that away) ’
Janine, don't ask me about official 7
motivations, I've never understood
why they do what they do.

She nods, accepting that.

JANINE
Did you find what you wanted today?

MATT :
I found something. Mostly, I'm
more confused than I was before,
JANINE
In what way?

MATT
(looking around)
Let's sit somewhere,

JANINE
Sure. Come on,

She leads the way down the hall.

AN ANGLE to include the open doorway where Breen is watching
a garden show on TV again, Janine and Matt pasa.

MATT
Evening, father.

BREEN
Evening, Matthew.

INT. BREAKFAST R00M - NIGHT

Janine switches on lights as she enters. In addition to
the tables and sideboard, there's a sofa against one wall,

JANINE
We can sit here,

MATT
Fine,

They sit a distance apart, half-turned toward each other,

MATT
Let me just tell you the situation,
49

EXT. 163RD ROW - DAY

Five years ago, The street is the same except that the
buildings at 45 and 47 are different, 45 18 a somewhat
older apartmant building, the same size aa the one there
now. 47 1a a wreck of a building, with concrete block
covering the door and windows on the lower floors, broken
glass above, a prominent FOR SALE sign nailed to the
front. Matt, dressed as in the scene with his father,
crosaes the street, moving AWAY from CAMERA, and enters
the dark vestibule at 45,

MATT (VO)
I came here once, five years ago.
My father lived in forty-five. The
place next to it, forty-seven, was
@ complete wreck.

INT. BREAKFAST ROOM - NIGHT

MATT
My father and me, we weren't ever
very close, so okay, this 1s the
first time I come to see him since
then. No phene calls, no letters.
He isn't there. Okay, I can accept
that, he moved away, Maybe he died,
I'll go look, see what I can find
out, but I'm stopped before rf start,
because ever goddam body in thia
neighborhood swears that building
that's there now was there five yeara
@go, and it wasn't.

JANINE
But why would anybody say that?
It doesn't make any sense.

MATT

The minute I got here, two guys in
the deli wanted to fight with me
because I said those were new
buildings. ‘That's crazy. I got
cops following me around, leaning
on me, telling me to go away, get
out of the precinct. The barman
down at Dave's -- on the corner?
= just told me to move away, he
won't serve me any more.

(holds up paperbag)
I got a sandwich and coffee at the
deli. I think the only reason they
don't tell me get lost ta, they
don't speak English,
50

JANINE
What are you going to do? Are -
you going away? “

‘t MATT
I can't. I got to have an enawer,
That's it. Nothing else,

JANINE
You went to see the building owner
today, didn't you? pid you find him?

MATT
(Aronic) ‘
Oh, yeah, I found him,

JANINE
He couldn't give you any answers?

MATT
He wouldn't even listen to the
question. There's some kind of
6lection coming up, somebody
running for mayor, that's all
this fellow Oberman wants to think
about. But he gave me more things
to think about.

JANINE
He did?

MATT
I finally found something that
belonged to my father, and he's
got it. Oberman. in his office,
How does that happen? I think,
okay, maybe my father died in the
apartment, when they're cleaning it
out for another tenant, they find
the picture, he likes it, takes it
for himself,

JANINE
Picture?

MATT
An o11 painting of my mother. My
father paid for 1t one time when he
thought he was flush, My mother
died when I was a kid, so that's what
we had of her. The beautiful lady up
on the wall. And now it's on
Oberman's wall.
ry

a

51

JANINE
Did you ask him about tt? ‘

MATT
I told you, he didn't want to be
asked about anything. But if it
was 48 simple aa that, if it's
just my father died in the apartment
and that's why Oberman's got the
picture, why doesn't somebody
gay so? Oh, sure, Eugene Belley,
died three years ago, heart attack,
stroke, whatever, Why have a whole
community telling lies about a
building, why have everybody leaning
on me to go away?

JANINE
It doean't make sense. I know you're
sure of the address and everything--

MATT
I'm sure, and I'm sure about that
picture. That's the only mother I
ever had, I'm not gonna forget what
it looked like. go I could be stupid
and mistaken and crazy a hundred
different ways, but there's still a
link of some kind between my father
@nd Alec Oberman, and the picture
proves it.

JANINE
So you want to find out what the
link is,

MATT

Yes. Is there any way out of here
except the front door?

He takes hia coffee out of the paperbag, starts to drink it.
She smiles at him, understanding,

JANINE
You want to avoid the police.

MATT
Let them think they've tucked me in,

JANINE
But where are you going? What are
you going to dot
52

MATT
Break into an apartment.

She's startled; then worried for him,

JANINE
But-- What 1f you get caught?

He leans toward her, with a confidential smile,

MATT
Janine. I'm a career criminal,
remember? That's my career.
So is there a back way out?

JANINE
Through the graveyard,

MATT
(amused and pleased)
Graveyard? I didn't even know
you had one,

JANINE
It's small, and very old. All
nineteenth century. It hasn't
been used for a hundred years,

MATT
But there's a way out,

JANINE
Onto the side street,

MATT
Perfect.
(finishes coffee)
Just let me get a couple things,
and then you can show me.

JANINE
I'll take that,

“He hands her the empty styrofoam cup, and leaves the room.

INT. DORMITORY - NIGHT

Buster 1s on the floor beside the bed neareat the door.
He's doing very tough exercises. The ceiling fluorescents
are on. Matt enters, moving fast. Buster sits up, grinning.

BUSTER

How you doing, Buster? “

BUSTER

You need a friend.

Surprised, Matt pauses in opening his duffel bag.
and nods at Buster,

He grina
MATT
You may be right.

BUSTER
Heavy lifting. Let me know when,

MATT
I will.

From the duffel, Matt brings a piece of gray felt in a
roll, maybe five inches long, tied with an attached lace,
He puta it in his pants pocket, then changes into black
shirt and dark jacket. He puta a black cloth cap in

the jacket pocket. .

MATT -
Thanks, Buster. I appreciate it.

BUSTER
Sure.

MATT
And you'll be here?

BUSTER
These days, & hundred fifty-ninth

. MATT
In the neighborhood,

BUSTER
Walk there.

54

Matt has a new thought to chew. He closea and stows away

his duffel while thinking 1t over,

MATT

That's right, isn't it? Those
other buildings had to be torn

down,

BUSTER
Demolition, Everything geta
demolition. Sooner or later,

sverything gotta go.

MATT
You're right about that.

He crosses the room, pauses to pat Buster on
MATT
Thanks, Buster. I'll see you

Matt leaves. Buster smiles after him.

MATT
I couldn't agree more.

EXT, RECTORY - NIGHT

The rear of rectory and church, seen in pale moonlight &nd
distant streetlights. The church is on the corner and ig
deeper than the rectory, so the area behind ig an L,
enclosed by a six foot brick wal + Most of the space is
the old graveyard; small leaning stones, maintained lawns,
neat gravel paths. Janine comes out of the rectory,
followed by Matt.

JANINE
This way,

As they walk through the graveyard, Matt looks at the stones,

MATT
I see what you mean. These are old,

JANINE
Eighteen-forties, some of then,

She stops, points,

JANINE
There's whole families. And babies,
too, they didn't all get to grow up
in those days. But they were born
here and lived and died here, and
it was just a little village. Before
the city spread out this far.

MATT
Farmers,

JANINE
That's right.

MATT
{ironic grin)
Not many farms left around here,

JANINE
Or families, either. The door's
over here,

In the middle of the wall separating the graveyard from
the side street ig a heavy wooden door. Janine leads
the way to it.

MATT
Where's your family?

For a second, she thinks she might not answer, but then ashe does.
56

JANINE

Michigan, ,
MATT

I take it you don't keep in touch.
JANINE

Oh, no. They made that perfectly

clear,

She unlocka the door in the wall, opens it, leang through

the opening to look around outside. She leans back in,
turns to Matt.

JANINE
(whispered)
There's no one there.

MATT
(low)
Thanks,

JANINE
I'm sorry, there's no key, there's
no way to unlock it from outside,
Matt bends to study the lock, then straightens and smiles.

MATT
Don't worry about it,

JANINE
You mean, you're going to break
in here.

MATT
The farmers won't mind.

She's holding the door open. He steps through, turna bask,
puts his hand on her hand on the door.

MATT
Janine. Thanks,

She's startled by the touch, and afraid of ite

JANINE
It's nothing,

He exits. She closes the door, stands with both hands
touching the door, looking at the door. When she speaks,
she 1s forcefully ordering herself.

JANINE
No,

She turns away, walks back through the graveyard,

AN ANGLE stratght ahead at Dave's bar. No one in sight
outside, windows too small and cluttered to see in, Matt
comes around the corner onto the block, jacket collar
turned up, wearing the cloth cap, hands in pockets. He

to get home,

AN ANGLE from behind hin, Seeing Wygand's car still in

outside the open door, Inside, in harsh light, we SEE

block, goes up the steps, entera, The guard is glad to
see her; she's one of the bright spots in his day.

GUARD
Hi, Janine. Night.

JANINE
Night, Murray,

She goes on in and out of sight. He nods, smiling faintly,
looking out at the street. When he SPEAKS, he's saying
what he's not ateease enough to say directly to her.

QUARD
Don't let the bed bugs bite.

INT, BATHROOM - NIGHT

Matt dismantles the shower curtain rod, looks inside it,
puta it back,

AN ANGLE on Wygand's oar. They're yawning and stretchifig
in there, Zack starts the engine and the car drives
away around the corner.

INT, BEDROOM - NIGHT

Small, neat, impersonal. Matt removeg every drawer from
the dreaser, looking at its back and bottom, feeling in
the space where the drawer goes. One drawer has a
letter-size envelope taped to the back. He peels it off,
opens it, takes out ten one-hundred dollar bills. He fans
them, counts them, puts them back in the envelope, tapes
the envelope back onto the drawer, puts the drawer away.

LATER. AN ANGLE on the closet. Matt is taking every
piece of clothing out, frisking it, tossing it on the bed.

LATER. The bed piled with clothing. Matt is tn the
closet, rapping on the walls, listening.

LATER. ‘The clothing gone from the bed, closet door closed,

carries the screwdrivers to the kitchen. The picture comes
up on the TVs a cooking show. M&tt comes back into the

watches.

MATT
Good crowd tonight? ’

She looks from him to the door she's still holding open,
back to him.

VIVIAN
(outraged)
You broke in heret

MATT
(calm)
Nothing broken,

She hasn't decided if she's coming in or going out. She
looks at the doorlock, absorbs what he's said, frowns at nim.

VIVIAN
Good crowd? What do you mean,
good crowd?

MATT
At the Blue Narcissus,

She steps further in, shuts the door,

VIVIAN
Get me a drink, will you?

Matt stands, smiling lazily at her.

MATT
Beer?

VIVIAN
I think vodka on the rocka.

She exits towurd the bedroom. Matt moves toward the kitchen.

MATT
Coming up,

INT. KITCHEN ~- NIGHT

Matt moves with easy familiarity; he knows this kitchen now.
First he opens a bottle of beer for himself, drinks from
the bottle. Then he gets down a glaas, puts in ice, gets

out the vodka, pours, puts the vodka away, picks up glass
and bottle, and exits.

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Matt crosses to put the bottle and glass on coasters on the

coffee table, as Vivian comes in from the bedroom. Again,
she's changed into something more cagual and provocative.
61

VIVIAN
(controlled anger) oy
Did you search this place?

MATT
Sure.

He picks her glass up and carriea it to her.

VIVIAN
Why? What were you looking for?
MAT? ,

You,
He extends the glass toward her, she glares at him.

MATT
(easy)
If you throw this one in my face,
you'll make the next one yourself,

She takes the glass. She considers throwing 1t in his face.
He smiles at her, waiting. She gulps vodka instead, marches
around him toward the sofa. He turns to watch her.

VIVIAN
(angry bafflement)

She sits on the sofa, erect, like a queen on & throne, to
deal with this serf.

VIVIAN
Did you find me?

MATT
Some of you,

He sits in the armchair near her,

MATT
I know you come from California,
I Know you don't keep in touch,
You must have the smallest phone
bill of anybody in New York city.

VIVIAN
(defensively angry)
I'm at work,

MATT
I know you lived for a while ona
boat. In the Caribbean, it looks
like. With a guy witha little
goatee, kinda reddish,

VIVIAN
(remembered sadness) ,
Jerry. He's dead. “
MATT

I didn't imow that part,

VIVIAN
I don't like you going through
things like that.

MATT .
Sorry. That was the only thing
that-- What did you call it?
Sentimental value, is there any
such thing 4s sentimental value.
I guess for you that picture of
Jerry is it.

She tries to dlamiss it, make it meaningless,

VIVIAN
I forgot I still had that.

MATT
You used to travel a lot up until
@ couple years ago, maatly South
America, but you never kept any
souvenira, I'm wondering 1f maybe
you were a mule,

VIVIAN
(cold dignity)
I don't even know what that means.

MATT
Maybe Jerry got you into that.
Then he's dead, and maybe you got
scared, decided to change careers,
I know you get migraines.

VIVIAN
What does that prove?

MATT
Nothing. I know you keep a thousand
dollars tucked a-- -
Vivian jumps in her seat, scared and really furious.

VIVIAN
You found that?
63

MATT
Sure. Not enough for a etake, just .
enough to vanish. I figure you “

figure you don't need a stake. Your
looks are your stake.

VIVIAN
(sarcastic)

Oh, really? Good looks are supposed
to be an asset?

MATT .
That's what I elways heard.

VIVIAN
You heard wrong. All good looka
does 1s make you a target,

MATT
That's a new one on me. You feel
sorry for yourself because you're
beautiful,

VIVIAN
(curt dismiasal)
I'm not beautiful. I'm passable,
MATT
Right. With straight As.
She frowns at him, irritated and confused.
VIVIAN

If that's what you think, why do
you treat me this way?

MATT
I went to the Blue Narcissus last
night.

VIVIAN

What? For God's sake, why?

MATT
I wanted to see your landlord,
Imagine my surprise when I saw you.
I like your singing, by the way.

She brushes that aside,
VIVIAN

What do you mean, you wanted to
see my landlord?
: MATT
Alec Oberman. He would have been ,
my father's landlord, too, 7

She's taken aback that he even knows the name,

VIVIAN
Alec isn't-- That ian't-- ‘There's

corporations.

MATT
A corporation 1s a tent. You ever
try to have a conversation with a
tent? You gotta open the flap, step
inside, say 'How you doin?!

VIVIAN
No one could get to Alec from the
corporations, they're designed to
keep you from reaching through to
anybody real,

MATT
Vivian, I was motivated. and the
point is, I went there to see hin,
which I did, but I also saw you.

VIVIAN
You saw him? You talked to him?

MATT
He's a difficult fellow. I'm going
to have to talk to him again,

VIVIAN
He won't like that,

MATT
What that asshole likes or doesn't
like doesn't bother me at all.

VIVIAN
If you think Alec Oberman ia an

asshole, you've got some surprises
coming,

MATT
I like surprises, You, for instance,
you were a surprise,

VIVIAN
(wary)
How do you mean?

I know you did, I understand that,
So what?

MATT
The fella at the club there says
you're there every night except
Monday and Tuesday. But the night
before last, you weren't there.
You just happened to be coming home

I thought I was coming down with
something, I was getting laryngitis.

VIVIAN
Think what you want to think.

MATT
Alec Oberman knew my father,

VIVIAN

Did he say so?

MATT
He haa something that belonga to
my father, that my father wouldn't

She looks at him, then smiles in relief,

Good night, Vivian.

He turns away toward the door, as she stands, distressed,

VIVIAN
(more honest)
Matt.

He stops, looks at her,
67

VIVIAN
First of all, it isn't just Alec. .,
You can find him because he's in

love with that club.

MATT
Who are the others?

VIVIAN
You'll never get near them. Matt,
no one of them owns anything all by
himself, It's all partnerships.
Alec is one of half a dozen partners
in the club. He's a partner with
some other people thet own this
building. He's in business all
over New York, with these partners,
those partners. They're all connected
together, business and politics,
they've all got pieces of the
different pies.

MATT
Like the mab, you mean,

VIVIAN
Not gangsters, they're businessmen.
They get into companiea together,
to make a profit. They know each
other, they trust each other, nobody's
too greedy, nobody's gonna break a
lot of laws and embarrasa everybody.

MATT
That's them. What about you?

VIVIAN

(shrug)
I'm a useful girl. go I've got a
good job at the club, it's getting
me exposure. I don't pay much rent
for this place. I don't sleep with
Alec Oberman, I don't sleep with any
of the partners, I never have, it's
not that way. But from time to
time, I can be helpful,

MATT
Like with me,

VIVIAN
Of course. Alec said, 'This guy's
coming around where we've got a
sensitive situation. Why ia he
there? To make trouble in the
election?!
68

MATT
What sensitive situation?

VIVIAN

I don't know. That's not the kind
of question I ask,

MATT
Okay.

VIVIAN
So I was supposed to come find you,
talk to you, find out what waa going
on. Yesterday, I talked with Alec
again, I told him I thought you were

MATT

because of this election. They
aren't gangsters, but they'll protect

That cop Wygand. If you're still
here in a day or two, how hard would
' it be for him to hit you with a

You mean find a gun on me,

VIVIAN
Or drugs. Whatever's easy.
And what happens then?

MATT
I go back inside. And some other
day, I come out again,

VIVIAN

I shouldn't give a damn about you,
but--

: MATT
Is this part of the spiel?

VIVIAN
Not If you're so busy searching
for me, can't you see that?

He starts to shake his head. She yanks him closer, staring

intently at him. He focuses, puts his arme around her,
kisses her, He pulls back slightly.

MATT :
Why do you have to be so damn tough?

VIVIAN
The same reason aa you.

She kisses him. He responds. SLOW FADE.
EXT. GRAVEYARD - DAY

There's a bench by the brick wall. Matt sits on it, holding
a coffee mug. He broads at the gravea,

EUGENE
He's starting to figure 1t out now.
He's starting to know where he
should look for me,

Janine comes out, looking for something -- looking for Matt.
She sees him, smiles, crosses the graveyard to him. He
doesn't react.

JANINE
Good morning.

He comes out of it, realizes she's there,

Wygand can't follow this, doesn't know how to react, decides
to go along with it, but only aa a tough guy. He points a
manacing finger at Matt.

at the hand holding him, Wygand releases him,

WYGAND
I'll tell you what's healthier than

painted blue, marked B N DEMOLITION, spaced here and there.
A blue wooden. fence around the site, a steep temporary dirt

road down to basement level where part of the old construction
has been removed completely.

A dumpster hauler backs laboriously down the steep road,
guided by several SHOUTING MEN, bringing a fresh empty
dumpster, It unloads it with a great deal of shrill NOISE,

Matt comes to the break in the fence where the road goes
down. He watches, then starts forward. A GUARD in a
hardhat stepa forward to intercept him.

GUARD
Sorry, mister. No entry.

MATT
A friend of mine works down there,

me around.

The guard is neutral, merely doing his job,

75

They step out of the way of the dumpster hauler, moving

very slowly upward, Matt reads the side, ,
MATT

I've seen these around the neighborhood,

SMITH
Oh, sure. This ia our turf.

The hauler finishes going by. They walk again,

MATT
Turf?

SMITH
All the companies, they got their
own areas, they don't look for jobs
in each other's territory. Makes
it easier.

MATT
No competition.

SMITH
No cutthroat. We don't try to do
it on the cheap, get people killed.

MATT
Okay.

AN ANGLE at the top of the road, Wygand in the opening,
frowning down after Matt, unable to figure out what he's
up to. He has to move out of the way of the hauler.

AN ANGLE on Matt and Smith, reaching the bottom.

MATT

around here,

SMITH
If it's bigger than a two-family
house and smaller than Madison

Buster will be over this way.

They walk into an area where building parts jut two stories
up. A CREW above breaks off debris, drops 1% into a chute,
it slides down to a half-full dumpster, Buster and another
MAN stand in the dumpster with long-handled shovels, moving

‘the debris as it comes down, stowing it, packing it so no
space is wasted.

 
76

Buster sees Matt, smiles big, waves, gestures he'll be down
in one minute.

SMITH
You okay here?

MATT
Sure,

SMITH

Holler if you need anything.

Matt noda his thanks. Smith leaves, and Matt watches the
work. Buster is somehow gawky but agile, which he has to
be, with all this heavy debris crashing down around him.
The dumpster rapidly fills, Buster and the other man
moving around on top of the trash. When it's full, they

climb down the outside. The other man walks off. Buster
comes over to Matt.

BUSTER
Heavy lifting.

MATT
You're good at it.

BUSTER
Ten years.

MATT
Is this a union job?

BUSTER
Oh, yes. You could join,

MATT
Maybe go.

Buster becomes more confidential.

MATT
Buster says this stuff gets its own
dump.

DRIVER
Yeah, it's toxic, stuff coming out

earth over the trash, Behind them, grasa is planted and

watered. At the rearmost 1a a field, flat, with nothing
but new grass and a few weeds.

EXT. LANDFILL - DAY.

It'a the driver's turn at the face. He Swings the big tig
around in a circle, backs to the face, the big tires
crunching down on raw demolition trash: beams, window
frames, chunka of plaster wall, banisters., The rear tires
reach the edge, so the end of the dumpster overhangs the
drop. The driver works the hydraulics so the dumpster
lifts upward from the front to a 45 degree angle; then he
pulls the rod that opens the back, swinging outward, The
load crashes down out of the dumpster, sliding rapidly
over the tilted steel floor. In addition to building
pieces, there are sinks, mattresses, chairs, a bathtub,

Matt opens his door, steps out onto the upper step, looks

back, watching the operation. There's too much NOISE here
for conversation.

The dumpster's empty. The driver reverses the hydraulics;
the dumpster drops back down onto the hauler with a CLANG,

the door awinging, not quite Closing. Matt gets back inside
the cab.

INT, OBERMAN'S OFFICE - NIGHT

MATT
For Buster, that was like a vision.
He still can't get over it. The
first time he saw me, he told me
about it, but I didn't get it. It
sounded like a religious thing, a
miracle vision or something.

OBERMAN

(looking at painting)
It was almost like that,

EXT, 45 AND 47 - DAY

WIDE SHOT, furious activity, workmen Clearing debris into
dumpsters. Two limousines are already there, OWNERS
standing beaide them, looking in shock and panic at the

CONVERSATION, planning, scheming,

MATT
One or more of your partners was
very close to the mayor. You could
skip around the regulations because
of that. But now you had a disaster.
The mayor's cronies demolished the
wrong building. Would the papers
like that? Would the local TV news?
And two weeks before the election.
The debris even got heid up by a
rally for your guy!

OBERMAN
(exasperated)
How do you know all this crap?

MATT
What do you care? I know it, that's
the point. And I kmow what you did,
to keep it out of the papers and
off the TV. You cleared the whole
thing off in one day, You paid off
everybody who used to live in forty-
five, found them new places to live,
furniture, clothes, You bought off
anybody in the nedghborhood that
might have a big mouth. It wasn’t
Manhattan, it was just a little outer
borough neighborhood nobody ever
looks at, so you could make it work.
Nobody ever knew. But why does
everybody say the buildings are
twelve years old? What difference
does it make?

OBERMAN
Certificate of occupancy. We couldn't
request a new certificate of occupancy
because we nad no building permits,
nothing, no right to put the building
up. So we had to pretend it was the

old building, with the old certificate
of occupancy,

MATT
I can se@ why you didn't like me
showing up. “

OBERMAN
Four years later. We took care of
everybody, we solved all the
problems. Some people lost their
photo albums, stuff like thate-

OBERMAN
We paid extra for the sentimental
value. We put the lid on it. Thank
God it happened when it did,
Everyoody was at work,

MATT
My father was retired,

Oberman looks at him, and realization sinks in. He's been
avoiding this thought.

OBERMAN

I don't believe what you're saying.
MATT

It's true,

We didn't find a body!
