BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY - Rev. 9/7/94

FADE IN:
EXT. JOHNSON FARMHOUSE - DAY

CAROLYN, mid-40s, is standing in the doorway of the
farmhouse watching a car drive up the road towards her.

A LAWYER is unloading a briefcase from the trunk of his
car.

As the car approaches, Carolyn smiles. She steps out of
the doorway and heads for the car, out of which exit her
brother MICHAEL and his country girl wife BETTY, a stout
buxom chatterbox. Both boast Florida tans and fashion
styles.

MICHAEL
(to Carolyn)
Explain to me again why we didn't
do this in Des Moines in an air
conditioned office?

—~ CAROLYN
Mom's orders.

MICHAEL
Is that the lawyer?

CAROLYN
(nods)
I have some sandwich fixings if
you're hungry.

BETTY

(proudly)
No, we just had lunch at the hotel
with my brother and his new wife.
She told me all the dirt. I.
forgot how interesting things can
get around here. It was so good
to see them. The last time we
visited they were in Europe. He
is doing so well. He ordered
champagne. For lunch! I nearly
died.

MICHAEL
I nearly died when I had to pick
up the check.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

BETTY
Michael doesn't understand.
People who make the kind of money
my brother makes don't carry money
on them. They keep it all in
various accounts.

MICHAEL
Then we should have had lunch at
the bank.

Carolyn tries not to laugh. Betty shoots him a dirty
look, then stops take in the house and its surroundings.

BETTY
Boy. It sure has been a long
time.

MICHAEL

(correcting her)
We were here two Christmases ago.

BETTY
Well, that's a long time.

: MICHAEL
It's not that long.

BETTY

(suddenly upset )
Well why don't I just say black so
you can say white!

(to Carolyn)
Don't be surprised to find your
brother hasn't changed an iota.
He hardly ever talks and when he
does it’s in that tone! You
should have heard him at lunch --
not two words until the bill came
and then he says, ‘Worth every

penny.’
MICHAEL
(defensive)
So!
BETTY
(angry)
i i onet Like

you were angry at me, at my
brother, at the world for forcing
you to eat a nice lunch!

(CONTINUED )
CONTINUED: (2)

MICHAEL
Oh, Jesus.

BETTY
(starting to cry)
I simply cannot stand that tone!

CAROLYN
(sympathetically)
Come inside. You're just tired
from the trip. :

She comforts Betty, who indulges in the attention.

BETTY
I’ am so sick and tired of
apologizing and not knowing what
I've done!

CAROLYN
I'm sure you haven't done
anything. Have some iced tea.
How are the kids? .

MICHAEL
We dropped them off with Betty's
mom. Where's Steve?

CAROLYN
(uncomfortably)
He's not coming.

Betty suddenly stops crying and abrasively focuses on
Carolyn's problems.

BETTY
Aw, is he still cheating on you,
hon?
Carolyn suddenly loses sympathy for her.

CUT TO:

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
The Lawyer hands Michael a document.

LAWYER
Just sign here as having received
the contents from the safe deposit
box.

CONTINUED:

LAWYER (CONT'D)
(as Michael does)
And this one, which clears the
bank of all further responsibility
for the contents.

Betty whispers to Carolyn.

BETTY
This is kind of exciting. You
think we'll find out your mother
had secret millions lying around?

Carolyn smiles weakly. Michael hands back the papers.

ee LAWYER
All right. Why don't we begin?

He takes out Francesca'’s Last Will and Testament.

LAWYER
Your mother has been interred at
Cedar Heights Funeral Home until
arrangements can be made.

- MICHAEL
(to Carolyn)
I thought everything was arranged.

CAROLYN
Well, there's a problem.

MICHAEL
What problem?

LAWYER

Your mother left explicit
instructions that she wished to be

cremated,

MICHAEL
Cremated?!

BETTY
Eeeww!

CAROLYN
I know. I don't understand it
either.

MICHAEL

When did she decide this?
(CONTINUED )
BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY - Rev. 10/12/94

CONTINUED: (2)

LAWYER
(reading will)
Apparently just before her death.

MICHAEL
Well, that's crazy. I don’t know
anybody who gets cremated.

BETTY
Lots of people do.

MICHAEL
Well, no one in my family did! Dad
bought cemetery plots at Prairie
Hills. One for him, one for Mom.

LAWYER
It clearly states in the will --

. MICHAEL
I don't care what it says! Maybe
Mom was delirious, you know. She
didn't know what she was saying.
If she wanted to be cremated, why
the hell did she let Dad buy two
plots, huh?

LAWYER
Well, she was very specific. She
wanted her ashes to be thrown off
Roseman Bridge.

MICHAEL
What?!

BETTY
How bizarre!

CAROLYN

Mr. Peterson, are you sure Mom
wrote all this?

LAWYER
Well, it was notarized and
witnessed by a Mrs. Lucy Delaney.
Maybe you can ask her.

MICHAEL
Who the hell is Lucy Delaney?

CAROLYN
I remember a Mrs. Delaney but Mom
told me years ago she died.

(CONTINUED )
2a

CONTINUED: (3) 2

MICHAEL
Well, I don't care if it's legal or
not, we're not cremating her and
throwing her off some bridge where
we can't even go visit her because
she's going to be blown all over
the place like an ashtray.

BETTY
Not to mention people driving over
her and doggies doing their
business -- °

MICHAEL
(interrupting) .
We're not doing it! I'm not even
sure it's Christian.

BETTY
Maybe it's an Italian thing.
(to Lawyer) .
Their mother was Italian.

MICHAEL
Doesn't matter. Move on.

The women dare not object. The lawyer raises his
eyebrows and continues:

LAWYER
Well, we'll come back to that.
Shall we open the box?

JUMP CUT TO:

SAME SCENE - CLOSE ON SAFETY DEPOSIT BOX - MOMENTS 2A
LATER .

A key is inserted and the lid is opened. There are many
papers, deeds, etc. Michael begins sorting through these.

Carolyn notices a manila envelope addressed to her mother,
postmarked 1965. She opens it up to find two letters and

a photograph -- Francesca standing near a covered bridge,

her hair wind-blown, her expression serene, beautiful and

sad.

CAROLYN
Michael, look -- I've never seen
this picture of Mom, have you?
Betty and Michael look over her shoulder. He shakes "no."

(CONTINUED)
2A

CONTINUED: 2A

CAROLYN
It was in this envelope from 1965.

BETTY
She's not wearing a bra.
(takes bridge photo)
This is Holliwell Bridge, in case
anyone's interested.

Interested, yes, but no one thinks anything of it.
Michael returns to the other papers. Betty takes the
photograph for further examination. Carolyn opens one
of the letters and begins to read.

The following dialogue is heard 0.S., as CAMERA ANGLES
ON Carolyn reading one of the letters:

BETTY (0.S.)
It's a beautiful picture of her.

MICHAEL (0.S.)
(to Lawyer)
Why are there two deeds here?

LAWYER (0.S.)
One is for the original parcel
your father bought and this one is
for the additional acres he
purchased in '59.

MICHAEL (0.S.)
And this?

LAWYER (0.S.)
Those are bills of sale from the
equipment your mother sold in...

Their conversation continues 0.S. Throughout their
conversation, we FOCUS ON Carolyn as she reads and
her expression sinks into one of shock and confusion.
She flips to the last page of the letter to read who
it is from. She can't believe her eyes.

BETTY (0.S.)
What's that?

Carolyn. jumps a little, so engrossed in her discovery.
She lies.

CAROLYN
Oh, just an old letter from a
friend.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED: (2) 2A

BETTY
(laughs )
No treasure maps, huh?

CAROLYN
(laughs nervously)
No.

Betty starts inspecting knick-knacks around the house she
might be able to take. Carolyn looks to Michael.

. CAROLYN
Michael.
MICHAEL
(reading documents)
Yeah?
CAROLYN
Michael.
MICHAEL
(irritated)
What !?
CAROLYN

Come here a minute.

Michael crosses impatiently to Carolyn. Carolyn looks
around to the others, then guides him 0.S. into the
kitchen for privacy. He protests.

MICHAEL
What? Where are we going?

They exit. Alone with the impatient Lawyer, Betty
examines a vase as she pumps him for info.

BETTY
Did she say anything in there
about me? Leaving me anything in
particular?

LAWYER
No.

Betty prattles on as she examines each item, much to the
Lawyer's dismay, hiding her resentment and hurt.

(CONTINUED)
2a

CONTINUED:

(3) 2a

BETTY
I didn't expect so. She never
liked me. It's okay. I always
knew. Thought we married too
young. Nobody broke his arm --
that's what I said, but you know
mothers and sons. Also, she
never liked the fact of us moving
to Florida although that's where
the opportunities were. Couldn't
deny that. Suppose we should have
visited more but you know she
hardly ever made an effort to come
to Tampa. Not even to see her
grandchildren. She was a cold
woman. They say Italians are hot
blooded but not her. She was ~
cool as ice.
(picks up a
candlestick)
She leave these to anyone?

Michael and Carolyn reenter the living room. Michael's
expression now matches Carolyn in disbelief.

Grateful,

BETTY
What's going on?
MICHAEL
Um... we were just wondering how

it might be better if Carolyn and
I went over the stuff by
ourselves. Not keep you two
waiting around. I'11l contact your
office about the legal work.

the Lawyer packs up to leave.

BETTY
I don't mind waiting.

MICHAEL
Well, there's a lot of boring
stuff to do. Lists of people we
have to write to. Find Mom's
relatives' addresses in Italy --
stuff like that.

BETTY
Well, I can help.

MICHAEL
I said no!

(CONTINUED)
2A

10.

CONTINUED: (4) 24
That came out a bit aggressively. Betty is hurt.

MICHAEL
Why don't you go to your mother's?
Or back to the hotel. Sit in some
air conditioning. Take a bath.

BETTY

(near tears)
I do not need instructions from
you to bathe!

(gets her bag)
I knew you'd do this! I knew I'd
come all the way here and be shut
out as usual! I came to be here
for you! I didn't have to come!

(genuinely hurt)
Lord knows I was never much
welcome in this house before.
Apparently dead-or alive,
nothing's changed.

CAROLYN
Aw, Betty.

Carolyn feels badly for her. An impatient Michael
refuses sympathy. Embarrassed, Betty starts to exit,
then stops at the mantle.

BETTY
Carolyn -- you want these
candlesticks?

CAROLYN

No. I'd like you to have them.
Betty grabs them both and exits. Carolyn looks at
him disapprovingly. Michael takes the letter from her
hands.

MICHAEL
Now what's this about?

CUT TO:

INT. KITCHEN - LATER 3

Sitting at the kitchen table, Carolyn is in the middle of
reading the letter to Michael.

(CONTINUED)
il.
CONTINUED:

CAROLYN

'... going over and over in my
mind every detail, every moment of
our time together and I ask
myself, "What happened to me in

. Madison County?" I struggle to put
it together in a way that allows
me to continue knowing we're on
Separate roads. But then I look
through the lens of my camera, and
you're there. I start to write an
article and I find myself writing
it to you. It's clear to me now we
have been moving towards each other,
towards those four days, all our
lives --'

MICHAEL
(rises)
I don't want to hear anymore!
Burn the damn thing! I don't want
to hear it! Throw it away!

Carolyn continues reading silently. Michael's curiosity
gets the best of him.

MICHAEL
What's he saying now?

CAROLYN
Well, he just goes on about how if
Mom ever needed him, she could
find him through the National
Geographic Magazine in Washington,
D.C. He was a photographer. He
promises not to write again. Then
all it says is...

(beat)

I love you... Robert.

MICHAEL
Robert! Jesus! I'11 kill him.

CAROLYN

That would be some trick. He's
already dead. That's what this
other letter is.

(takes letter and

skims )
From his attorney. He left most
of his things to Mom and
requested...

She stops.

(CONTINUED )
12.
CONTINUED: (2)

MICHAEL
What?

: CAROLYN
That he be cremated and his ashes
thrown off Roseman Bridge.

MICHAEL
amn him! I knew Mom wouldn't
have thought of that herself. It
was some damn perverted...
photographic mind influencing her!
When did the bastard die?

CAROLYN
"82.

MICHAEL
Wait a minute! That was three
years after Daddy. Do you
think...?

CAROLYN
I don't know. I'm completely in
the dark here. That's what I get
for moving away.

MICHAEL
This happened way before we both
got married. I... I can't

believe it.
(then, innocently)
You think she had sex with him?

Carolyn cannot believe he is this dense.

CAROLYN
(sarcastic)
My Lord. It must feel real nice
living inside your head with
Peter Pan and the Easter Bunny.

MICHAEL
Don't talk to me like that. She
was my mother, for Christ's sake.
And now I find out she was... She
was. a --

CAROLYN
Don't say that!

MICHAEL
Well what am I supposed to think?

(CONTINUED )
3A

13.

CONTINUED: (3) 3

CAROLYN
I can't believe she never told
me? We spoke at least once a
week. How could she do that?

MICHAEL
How did she meet him? Did Dad
know? Anything else in that
envelope?

CAROLYN
No, I don't think so. I --

She dumps it over and a small key falls out. Pause, as
Carolyn and Michael look to each other -- they grab the
key and run out of the kitchen, almost comically falling
ever each other in their obsession to put this puzzle
together.

SERIES OF JUMP CUTS 3A

FROM one lock TO another as they try to find the keyhole
that fits the key -- they try closets, attic doors,
jewelry boxes, night tables, vanity drawers... Finally --

INT. BEDROOM - DAY 4

At the foot of their parents’ bed sits a walnut hope
chest, covered with a tapestry. Michael and Carolyn
look to each other first, before one removes the
tapestry and the other tries the key. It fits. They
open the chest to find:

Camera equipment, a chain with a medallion that reads
"FRANCESCA," three leather bound notebooks -- and a
sealed envelope with "Carolyn or Michael" written on it.

CAROLYN/MICHAEL
You read it!

Carolyn relents. She takes out the letter and reads:

CAROLYN
"January, 1987. Dear Carolyn. I
hope you're reading this with
Michael. I'm sure he wouldn't be
able to read it by himself and
he'll need some help understanding
all this.’

(CONTINUED )
14.

CONTINUED:

Insulted, Michael pulls the letter out of her hand and
defiantly attempts to read it aloud himself to disprove
his mother's claim. But after looking at a few lines,
he surrenders and hands the letter back to his sister.

CAROLYN
"First, and most of all, I love
you both very much and although I
feel fine, I thought it was time
to put my affairs, excuse that
word, in order.'

MICHAEL
I can't believe she's making
jokes.

CAROLYN

Sshhh. ‘After going through the
safety deposit box, I'm sure
you'll find your way to this
letter. It's hard to write this
to my own children. I could let
this die with the rest of me I
Suppose. But as one gets older,
one's fears subside. What |
becomes more and more important
is to be known -- known for all
-that you were during this brief
stay. How sad it seems to me

to leave this Earth without those
you love the most ever really
knowing who you were. It's easy
for a mother to love her children
no matter what -- it's something
that just happens. I don't know
if it's as simple for children.
You're all so busy being angry

at us for raising you wrong. But
I thought it was important to give
you that chance. To give you the
opportunity to love me for all
that. I was...’

Carolyn and Michael look to each other like two school
children about to take a difficult exam. They continue.

CAROLYN
"His name was Robert Kincaid. He
was a photographer and he was here
in 1965 shooting an article for
National Geographic on the covered
bridges of Madison County.

CAROLYN (CONT'D)
Remember when we got that issue?
How we felt like celebrities?
Remember when we started getting
the subscription?’

They don't remember.

CAROLYN
"I don't want you to be angry
with him. I hope after you
know the whole story, you might
even think well of him. Even

grateful.'
MICHAEL
Grateful!?
CAROLYN |
(reads)

',.. It's all there in the three
notebooks. Read them in order.
If you don’t want to, I suppose
that's okay, too. But in that
case I want you to know something
-- I never stopped loving your
father. He was a very good man.
It's just that my love for Robert
was different. He brought out
something in me no one had ever
brought out before, or since. He
made.me feel like a woman in a
way few women ever experience...'
MICHAEL

(cuts her off)

That's it!

Grabbing the. letter, he starts putting everything back
in the trunk.

CAROLYN
What are you doing?

MICHAEL
This is crazy. She waits ‘til
she's dead to tell us all this.
Well, I got news for you. She
was my mother. That's enough for
me. I don't have to know who she
was.

CAROLYN
Well, I'd like to read them.

(CONTINUED )
16.

CONTINUED: (3)

MICHAEL
No. We're going to lock this up
and --

CAROLYN

t

(as Michael

freezes)
I want to read them! If you don't
want to then just leave. But
don't you push me around like I'm
some mule you paid for -- I
already hav !

Michael is stymied.

INT. KITCHEN - LATER

Carolyn opens the first notebook which is dated AUGUST
1965. Michael sits beside her with a cup of coffee.

: CAROLYN

(reading)
"It was the week of the Illinois
State Fair. The two of you were
going with Dad to exhibit
Carolyn's prize steer.’

Carolyn's voice becomes Francesca'’s voice as we --

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. JOHNSON HOUSE - EVENING

FRANCESCA is making dinner. A BLUES station is tuned in
on the RADIO.

FRANCESCA (V.O.)
"I know it sounds awful, but I
couldn't wait for you all to
leave. You were going to be
gone until Friday. Four days...
(beat)
Just four days...'

Francesca's expression looks as if she needs a break
from her family for more like four years.

FRANCESCA
Michael! Carolyn! Richard!
Dinner!

(CONTINUED)
17.

CONTINUED:

She sets down a bowl of potatoes, a plate of sausages,
coffee and corn as one by one her family enters and sits
down.

Michael enters through a screen door from the back,
letting the door slam shut.

FRANCESCA
Michael, what did I tell you
about that door?

Richard enters after Michael, letting the door slam the
same way. Francesca is about to say something, but gives

up.

Carolyn enters and crosses to the kitchen RADIO. Leaning
on the counter, she turns the dial to a COUNTRY station.
This clearly irritates Francesca, but she knows there is
no point in arguing. ~

Everyone sits and begins eating -- in complete silence
except for the song.

When Michael can't open the ketchup bottle, Francesca
grabs it, palms the top skillfully and twists it off.
She hands it back to Michael, who makes no comment.

When Richard scans the table for something that obviously
isn't there, Francesca is up out of her seat before he
can ask, at the fridge, grabbing the sour cream, closing
the fridge and back at the table with incredible
swiftness.

When Michael moves his big arm to reach for the salt, he
knocks over his cup and saucer, which Francesca catches
with both hands before they hit the floor. Her reflexes
are like a trained athlete.

Finally, Francesca is able to sit and sip her coffee.
She watches her teenage daughter fill her plate with a
blank expression that lets nothing slip through -- no
indication of all the tempests of emotions that go
through a teenage girl.

FRANCE“SCA
You excited about going, Carolyn?

Without looking up, Carolyn fakes a smile. Francesca
then looks to her son, shoveling food into his mouth at
an alarming rate. She attempts a conversation.

FRANCESCA
How was your date last night?

(CONTINUED )
18.

CONTINUED: (2)

_ MICHAEL
(without looking
at her)
Okay.

FRANCESCA
What's her name?

MICHAEL
Betty.

FRANCESCA
What's she like?

MICHAEL
Okay.

Silence. Frustrated, Francesca looks at Michael with
dismay. :

CUT -TO:

INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

Francesca is packing Richard's suitcase. Richard is at
his bureau. He is trying to open a drawer but it's
stuck.

RICHARD
Damn drawer!

Francesca crosses to him and ushers him aside. Holds
onto the drawer nobs, she looks at Richard, pauses, then
does a funny jolt with her body that makes the drawer
slip out easily.

FRANCESCA
You can’t get mad at it.

RICHARD
(to bureau, joking)
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have
yelled. May I get a handkerchief,
please?

Francesca chuckles as she closes up the suitcase.
Richard takes out a handkerchief from the drawer and
closes it.

FRANCESCA
You should stay away from anything
too spicy.

(CONTINUED )
19.
CONTINUED:

Words are no longer required. They read each other's
minds.

FRANCESCA
And I want you to promise me...

RICHARD
I swear. Only filters and no more
than half a pack a day. I got my
orders.

FRANCESCA
(defensive)
Doc Reynolds said you'd be a lot
better off --

RICHARD
I know, I know. I'm kidding. You
sure you don't want to come?

Francesca looks at Richard with complete conviction.

_FRANCESCA
I'm positive. -

RICHARD
What are you going to do for four
days as a woman of leisure?

: FRANCESCA
Same thing I do as a hired hand,
only with less help.

Francesca realizes this has hurt Richard's feelings.
She smiles.

RICHARD
I won't be able-to sleep ya know.
Can't sleep without you next to me
anymore.

FRANCESCA
It's only four days.

He gives her a sweet peck on the lips. Francesca touches
his face gently.

CUT TO:

EXT. JOHNSON HOUSE - NIGHT

Francesca waves as her family drives down the driveway
in their truck, kicking up a cloud of dust.

(CONTINUED)
9A

20.

CONTINUED: 8

When the dust fades, the truck is gone, out the driveway
and on the road.

Francesca turns and heads back to the house. As it
slowly comes into view from atop the corn husks, she
stops. She knows the house is empty now. She feels
both relief and uncertainty.

INT. JOHNSON HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT 9

Alone, dressed in her bathrobe, Francesca checks the

front door. She crosses to the living room. Noticing
two throw pillows on the floor, she arranges them neatly
on the couch. She sits herself in an easy chair then
flicks on a reading lamp and opens her book. After five
seconds, she closes the book. She crosses to the TV
and turns it ON, then turns it OFF before the picture
tuned in.

She turns and leans on the TV, flicking the ON/OFF
switch ON and OFF as her mind wanders. She gets an idea.
She crosses to the hi-fi and looks through several albums
she got from her Columbia Record Club. But nothing
inspires her and she quickly loses the desire for music.
She's antsy. She has this time alone and she doesn't
know how to spend it.

She walks through the dining room, passing a china closet
filled with fancy dishes and glasses. She stops. Shoved
in the corner behind is an old, unopened bottle of
brandy. She removes it, setting atop the dining table

to open it, then quickly changes her mind and returns

the brandy to its lonely spot on the shelf.

CuT TO:

INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS ACTION 9A

She walks into the kitchen and leans on the counter to
turn ON the RADIO. She stands just like her daughter as
she tunes in the BLUES station.

She sits at the Formica table with a glass of milk and
listens. A DOG SCRATCHES at the screen door. Francesca
rises to let him in.

FRANCESCA
Where've you been!? They already
left, ya know -- you missed them.

21.

CONTINUED: 9A

He sits by her chair at the table. She sits down. He
leans into her. She scratches his head.

FRANCESCA
I don't know why you're so sweet
on.me -- you know I don't like
you.

Of course, she does like him, she's just in a teasing
mood. The MUSIC PLAYS. Francesca softens as she pets
him.

FRANCESCA
You like this song?

* CUT TO:

EXT. JOHNSON HOUSE - DAY 10

Francesca, wearing a simple house dress, has two rugs
hung over the porch. She is beating them to get the dust
out. It is a hot day. She stops to wipe her brow. She -
grabs a glass of iced tea from off the porch, takes a

sip then presses the glass against her chest. Francesca
looks up to the sun to clear her mind. It is blinding.

When she looks back out onto her driveway, her vision is
momentarily blurred. Until, slowly, out of the blur,
she sees:

A truck driving toward her house, kicking up dust, like
some phantom appearing through the etheric plane. She
sips her cool drink and blinks to regain her vision. The
truck comes down her driveway and stops halfway.
Francesca watches with suspicious curiosity as:

The truck stops and ROBERT KINCAID steps out. Flashing
his blue eyes in her direction, he smiles and says:

ROBERT .
Sorry to bother you but I've got
a feeling I'm lost.

Francesca remains guarded.

FRANCESCA
Are you supposed to be in Iowa?

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

He laughs.

ROBERT
(laughs )
Yeah.

. FRANCESCA
Well you're not that lost.

She puts down her tea and crosses to him.

ROBERT
I'm looking for a covered bridge
out this way... uh... wait a
minute --

He looks through a small notepad for the name. Francesca
watches him intently.

FRANCESCA
Roseman Bridge?

ROBERT
That's it.

FRANCESCA

Well you're pretty close. It's
only about two miles from here.

ROBERT
Oh, terrific. Which way?

FRANCESCA

Go that way and you will come to

Cutter's where you turn left.

ROBERT
Cutter's?

FRANCESCA
Cutter's farm. Small house close
to the road. Big mean yellow dog.

ROBERT
Oh. Okay.

FRANCESCA
Yes, and then you just take that
road until it forks -- I think

less than half a mile.

ROBERT
Which fork?

(CONTINUED)
BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY - Rev. 9/7/94 23.

. FRANCESCA

The right and you go -- no. Not
that fork, excuse me. Then you
pass Peterson's -- Peterson's
farm, and by the old schoolhouse
you go left. It would be easier
to tell you if the roads were
marked.

ROBERT
Sure would.

Pause as Robert awaits directions and Francesca scans a
sudden impulse.

FRANCESCA
Well, I can take you if you want.

Robert is pleased, but a bit surprised as is Francesca’
who anxiously recants:

FRANCESCA
Or, I can tell you. I can take
you or tell you. It's up to
you. I don't care. Either way.

Robert smiles, finding her sudden nervousness charming.
ROBERT
If I'm not taking you away from
anything.

No. I was just going to have some

I just have to get my shoes.

Robert watches her as she turns and heads back to the
house. He turns back to the truck and notices the
mailbox -- MR. & MRS. RICHARD JOHNSON. He nods as if
he knew all along and begins to make room on the front
seat for Francesca. .

INT. JOHNSON HOUSE - SAME . 11

Francesca is slipping on her shoes when she suddenly
stops. "What am I doing?" she asks herself silently.

EXT. JOHNSON DRIVEWAY - SAME : 12

Francesca approaches the truck. On the door, she reads:
KINCAID PHOTOGRAPHY -- BELLINGHAM, WASHINGTON.

Robert is clearing away paper cups, banana peels, paper
bags, photography equipment. In the back, Francesca
notices a cooler and a guitar case.

ROBERT
I wasn't expecting company. Let
me get this out of the way.

He hauls a case of film from the front to the back.
Francesca notices his tanned, muscular arm move in one
graceful sweep.

ROBERT
Okay. All set.

Francesca smiles. They both get into the truck.

ROBERT
Now, where are we going?

FRANCESCA
Out, then right.

CUT TO:

EXT. MADISON COUNTY ROAD - DAY 13
The truck bounces along on the rock road, lime dust
filling the air. Kincaid and Francesca ride in silence.

The truck passes a small farmhouse, and a large angry
yellow DOG races alongside, SNARLING and BARKING.

Robert looks at Francesca and grins.

ROBERT
So far, so good. This way?

FRANCESCA
That way.

He follows her directions.

ROBERT
There's a wonderful smell about
Iowa -- very particular to this

part of the country. Do you know
what I mean?

FRANCESCA
No.

ROBERT
I can't describe it, I think it's
from the loam in the soil. This
very rich, earthy kind of...
alive... No. No, that's not right.
Can you smell it?

FRANCESCA
(shakes her head)
Maybe it's because I live here.

ROBERT
That must be it. It's a great smell.

Francesca wants to know more about him.

FRANCESCA
Are you from Washington originally?

ROBERT
Uh-huh. Lived there 'til I was
twenty or so, and then moved to
Chicago when I got married.

FRANCESCA
Oh. When did you move back?

After the divorce.

FRANCESCA
No, I don't mind. I'm not

ROBERT
Well, from Italy to Iowa ~- you
don't look particularly Italian.
(as Francesca smiles)
Whereabouts in Italy?

FRANCESCA
My mother was Austrian. We lived
in a small town on the Eastern
side, no one's ever heard of called

Bari.
ROBERT
Qh, yeah, Bari. I've been there.
FRANCESCA
(surprised)
No, really?

Oh, yeah. Actually, I had an
assignment in Greece and I had to
go through Bari, to get the boat
at Brindisi. But it looked so

He reaches over with one arm, brushing slightly against
her thigh. He opens the glove compartment and pulls out
a pack of Camels and a Zippo lighter.

ROBERT
Like one?

Francesca hesitates.

FRANCESCA
Sure, I'll have one.

She takes a cigarette out of the pack. Robert drops the
pack and, with the same hand, flicks open the Zippo and
ignites it. Francesca leans over. The road is bumpy and
a breeze blows through both windows. ee

She cups her hands around his to shelter the flame. She
feels his skin for a brief moment.

She sits back and enjoys the ride and her cigarette as
Robert lights up. Silence. They drive.

ROBERT
So, how long you've been living
here?

FRANCESCA
Long.

You just got off the train and
stayed without knowing anyone

there?

He smiles and takes his equipment to the bridge.
Francesca slowly follows. She watches his body move.
Catching herself, she stops.

Robert sets up a tripod in the small ravine beneath the
bridge, pointing a view finder up as he plans his shots.
Francesca walks through the bridge, noticing lovers' names
scrawled on the inside: CATHY & BUDDY 4 EVER ... ROSIE
AND HANK TIL THE END OF TIME. Through a crack in one of
the wooden planks, Francesca watches like a voyeur as
Robert works. She sees him take out a hankerchief and
wipe the sweat off his neck, then inside his shirt and
around his chest. Without knowing where Francesca is,
Robert speaks aloud:

ROBERT
Is it always this hot?

Francesca moves quickly away from the plank, like a
Peeping Tom who's been caught. .

FRANCESCA
This time of year.

ROBERT
I have some cold drinks in a
cooler if you'd like.

FRANCESCA
Oh. Would you like one?

ROBERT
Not right now thanks.

Francesca heads back to the truck, grateful for something
to occupy her.

EXT. ROSEMAN BRIDGE/INT. TRUCK - DAY 144

Inside the truck, she scans for the cooler bag. She sees
it next to a duffel bag. The bag's zipper is opened.

She glimpses inside at Robert's personal things --

clothes, socks, underwear, shav.ng kit. Life magazines
from July and August, one depicting the death of Adlai
Stevenson, the other a cover photo of the Watts riots. The
guitar leans against the cooler. She grabs a soda from

out of it.

over, picking flowers.

: FRANCESCA
There you are.

ROBERT
Oh! You caught me.

He rises with a bouquet of wildflowers for her.

ROBERT
Thanks for your help.

Francesca smiles, not knowing how to take this.

. ROBERT
Men still give women flowers don't
they? I mean, as a sign of
appreciation? I'm not that out of
date, am I?

FRANCESCA
No, not at all --
(suddenly)
-- except those are poisonous.

ROBERT
What!

He flings the flowers down. He wipes his hands furiously.

FRANCESCA
I'm sorry. I was kidding.

Robert looks at her with a shocked smirk, secretly liking
her strange behavior.

ROBERT
(smiling)
Are you by nature a sadistic
person?
She laughs as she helps him pick them up.

FRANCESCA
Looking for something in particular?
There's not much of a selection.

ROBERT
I found this Chicago station --
before. Wait a minute...

FRANCESCA
It's 1410.

Robert reacts with surprise, then tunes it in. We hear
a BLUES SINGER with a sax arrangement.

FRANCESCA
That's nice.

ROBERT
Want another cigarette?

FRANCESCA
Sure.

Francesca's having a great time.

16 EXT. JOHNSON HOUSE - DAY 16

Robert's truck drives down the road and into the
driveway.

ROBERT
Well, thank you for the
kindnesses, Mrs. Johnson.

FRANCESCA
Francesca.

Francesca nods, as if to say hello and goodbye in the
same moment. She gets out of the car, closes the door,
then asks:

FRANCESCA
Would you like some iced tea?

Robert fiddles with the kitchen RADIO, tuning in to the
Chicago station. Francesca is making iced tea. Robert
sits back down at the kitchen table.

FRANCESCA
Lemon?

ROBERT
Sure.

With her back to him, Robert never takes his eyes
off her. She turns and crosses to him, with the
tea. .

ROBERT
Thanks.

Francesca smiles and sips her own. She watches him gulp

down the tea so fast, some of it dribbles down the ide of
his face and neck. Francesca finds it sexy. He empties

it. .

FRANCESCA
Would you like another one?

Robert nods and pulls out his cigarettes. Robert lights
up as he watches her fix-another iced tea. He watches
her slip off one shoe, then the other -- never missing a
beat of her preparation. He can't help eyeing her body.
When she returns, she also has the flowers he picked for
her arranged in a jelly glass. She places them on the
table and sits.

ROBERT
Sure you want to keep those in the
house?

FRANCESCA
I'm so sorry ahout that. I... ha

ROBERT
Oh. How old?
FRANCESCA
About a year and a half.
ROBERT
No, your kids.
FRANCESCA
Oh. Michael's 17 and Carolyn's

ROBERT
Must be nice having kids.
FRANCESCA
They're not kids anymore. Things
change.
ROBERT

Everything does. One of the laws
of nature. People are always so
afraid of change. But if you
look at it like it's something
you can count on happening, it's
actually a comfort. Not many
things you can count on for sure.

FRANCESCA
I guess. Except I'm one of the
people it frightens.

ROBERT
I doubt that.
FRANCESCA
Why?
ROBERT
Italy to Iowa? I'd call that a
change.

And of course, being with Richard.

ROBERT
What's he like?
FRANCESCA
He's very... clean.
. ROBERT
Clean?
FRANCESCA

(catching herself)
No. I mean yes he's clean but
he's also other things. He's a
very hard worker. Very honest.
Very caring. Gentle. Good
father.

ROBERT
And clean.

FRANCESCA
Yes. Very clean.

They drink. Francesca thinks she sounds like an idiot.

ROBERT
So you must like Iowa I guess.

Francesca looks at him. She wants to tell the truth but
holds back.

FRANCESCA
It's... uh... uh...

She stops. Robert smiles.

ROBERT
Go ahead. TI won't tell anyone.

Surprised, Francesca looks at him oddly -- as if he
already knows and is giving her permission.

Francesca is so taken by his understanding and
acceptance, she lets the flood gates open, speaking
faster than her mind can keep up --

I'm supposed to say, ‘Just fine.
It's quiet. The people are real
nice.’ All of that's true, .
mostly. It is quiet. And the .
people are nice, in certain ways.
We all help each other out. If
someone gets sick or hurt, the
neighbors pitch in and pick corn
or harvest oats or do whatever
needs to be done. In town, you
can leave your car unlocked and
let your children run without
worrying about them. There are a
lot of good things about the
people here, and I respect them
for those qualities. But...

hesitates, lights a cigarette and looks across
at Kincaid.

FRANCESCA
It's not what I dreamed about
as a girl.

Kincaid is silent for a moment.

ROBERT
I scribbled something in my
notebook the other day for
future use, just had the idea
while driving along. That happens
a lot. It goes like this: ‘The
old dreams were good dreams; they
didn't work out, but I'm glad I
had them.’ I'm not sure what that
means, but I'll use it somewhere.
So I think I kind of know how you

feel.

Francesca

smiles at him. For the first time, the smile

seems warm and deep. She surprises herself. She
doesn't want him to go.

FRANCESCA
Would you like to stay for dinner?
There aren't many choices in town
and... anyway, you'd have to eat
alone. So would I.

Francesca rushes in and starts to disrobe, getting ready
to shower and change for dinner. She glances out the
window and sees:

EXT. JOHNSON HOUSE ~ SAME TIME 19

Robert is at the water pump. His shirt is off and he is
washing himself.

We INTERCUT the two.

INT. BEDROOM : 194

Francesca finds herself staring. He has a muscular, firm
body. She watches how the water cascades over his body.
How he seems so unashamed, so "in his skin,” moving with
such strength and grace.

EXT. JOHNSON HOUSE 19B

Robert pauses and looks out over the open pasture. The
cold water feels good. Since the pump is in the back of
the house, hidden from the road, no one can see him.

INT.. BEDROOM . 19¢

Francesca continues studying Robert until she has to
literally pull herself away from the window with such a
force that she rams herself into a chest of drawers.
Taking a breath, she pulls herself together.

FRANCESCA
This is ridiculous.

She heads for the bathroom, quite composed, then, without
warning, makes an immediate 180 degree turn and heads
back to the window to sneak a peek.

some of his gear.

ROBERT
I'm just going to put some of this

He does. On the RADIO, TONY BENNETT sings "Wrap Your

Troubles In Dreams." Robert approaches Francesca.

INT. KITCHEN - EVENING 22

Robert and Francesca are in the middle of dinner. But
instead of the usual silence that surrounds Johnson
family eating, Francesca is mesmerized by Robert as he
manages to eat and tell a story. The scene begins with
a laugh from Francesca. :

ROBERT
(laughs )
--. No, wait, it gets better.

He stands up and acts it out for her.

ROBERT
You have to get the full picture
here. I have three cameras around
my neck, a tripod in one hand and
my pants down around my ankles.
I thought this was a private bush.
I look up and this gorilla is
staring at me with what can best
be described as the most
lascivious expression I've ever
seen on a body with so much hair.

Francesca laughs.

I hope it was a female gorilla.

ROBERT
I hope so, too. We still write.

Francesca is laughing so hard she can't breathe. Robert
loves making her laugh.

FRANCESCA
You ought to write these stories
down.

ROBERT

Nah. L've tried. My writing's
too technical I think. Problem of
being a journalist too long is you
stop giving yourself permission to
invent. I better just stick to
making pictures.

ROBERT
No. I wouldn't say that. National
Geographic likes their wild life

in focus and without any personal
comment. I don't mind really.
I'm no artist. I'd faced that a
long time ago. It's the curse of
being well-adjusted. I'm too
normal.

I don't think you're normal.

He looks at her in surprise. She catches herself again.

Well, let's just call it a
compliment and move on.

Did you love teaching?

Sometimes. When there was a

difference. I know they're all
supposed to, but it's not true.
You tend to single out one or two

It's another world. Not just the

beast and beast, who'll survive,
who won't -- and there's no
judgment about it. No right or
wrong or imposed morality. It's
just life. It's a voyeur's
paradise really because those
animals don't want anybody in
their business. You can watch
but at a distance.

Robert smiles at her, sensing how in tune she is with
his feelings.

FRANCESCA
_My, God. How I'd love to see that.

ROBERT
They have safaris for tourists
now. Maybe you can convince your
husband.

Francesca smiles. There is an awkward pause between
them.

ROBERT
It's a beautiful night. Would you
like to go for a walk?

Yes. That would be nice.

He gets up and opens the screen door for Francesca,

W.B. Yeats, 'The Song of Wandering
Aengus.'

ROBERT

Right. Good stuff, Yeats.

Realism, economy, sensuousness,

beauty, magic. Appeals to my

Irish heritage.
She watches him with great appreciation. He smiles at
her. Instead of looking away, their eyes remain locked

. for a moment. There is clearly an attraction. They

simultaneously look away and continue walking.

Francesca's heart is beating a mile a minute yet she
can't deny she is enjoying herself. Walking side hy
side in silence, Francesca turns back occasionally

to look at her house as they get further away from it.
Suddenly, the more distant the house becomes, the more
frightened she starts to feel. Something inside her
knows she's going too far with this man -- too far from
home. Although a part of her wants it, she is surprised
to find a larger part of her finds it too unknown.

She stops. .

ROBERT
What's wrong?

Francesca looks confused for a moment, not knowing what
she wants. She can't move. She searches for a way out.

FRANCESCA
Would you like some coffee? .Or
maybe, some brandy?
Somehow Robert can sense her uneasiness. He obliges.

ROBERT
How about both?

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT 24

The room is illuminated by a single light over the
kitchen sink. Francesca moves about the kitchen
preparing coffee -- dropping the coffee pot basket,
spilling the grounds. She acts tense. Robert sits at
the table opening the brandy bottle Francesca almost
opened the night before, aware of her mood. There
are two brandy glasses in the cupboard that Robert
takes down.

Francesca gets the coffee going then sets the table
with cups and saucers.

ROBERT
You sure you won't let me help
you with those dishes?

FRANCESCA

No. I'll do them later.

Francesca freezes. He has read her mind again.

Carolyn pulls out a newly bought jar of Fluffernutter.

MICHAEL
Wow. I bet it's been here since

it recently. And it's not opened.

Realizing her mother did buy it for them, Carolyn's eyes
fill up a little, her mother's death striking her for the

Francesca sips her brandy. Robert sits across from her.

FRANCESCA
De you mind if I... ask you why
you got divorced?

ROBERT
Not at all. TI wasn't around
much... So why did I get married?

Well, I thought it was a good idea
at the time. Have a home base.
Roots. You can get lost moving
around so much.

FRANCESCA
So what happened?

ROBERT
I never got lost. I was more at
home everywhere than at one place.
So I decided to think of myself as
some kind of world citizen.

FRANCESCA
You must get lonely at times.

ROBERT
Never touch the stuff. I've got
friends all over the world. Good
friends I can see when I want, if
I want.

FRANCESCA
Woman friends, too?

ROBERT
I'm a loner, not a monk.

Francesca averts her eyes, before continuing her
investigation.

No, I think I need everyone! I

FRANCESCA
That's the thing about Iowa. You
pretty much meet the same ‘kind of
person over and over so when Mrs.
Delaney's husband is having an
affair with 'that Redfield woman'
the whole town wakes up.

ROBERT
I just think there are too many
out there saying, ‘This is mine,'
or, 'She's mine.’ Too many lines
have. been drawn. :

FRANCESCA
Doesn't it scare you?

. ROBERT
I don't know what's coming. And
I don't mind. I embrace mystery.

FRANCESCA
Do you ever regret it? The
divorce, I mean?

ROBERT
No.

FRANCESCA
Do you ever regret not having a
family?

ROBERT
Not everyone's supposed to have a
family. —

FRANCESCA
But -- how can you just live for
what you want? What about other
people?

I told you, I love other people.

FRANCESCA
No, I'm just saying --
ROBERT

I'm a little sick of this American
Family Ethic everyone seems to be

displaced soul doomed to roam the
earth without a self-cleaning oven

FRANCESCA

Just because someone chooses to
settle down and have a. family
doesn't necessarily mean they're
hypnotized. Just because I've
never seen a gazelle stampede

thing to ask.

Francesca shrugs it off.

FRANCESCA
I feel like something's been

Robert smiles and crosses to her. He takes her hand into
both his hands.

ROBERT
It's been a perfect evening. Just

He smiles and exits, catching the screen door before it
slams. Robert takes a few steps down the porch and turns.

ROBERT
One thing, though -- don't kid
yourself, Francesca. You're
anything but a simple woman.

Francesca doesn't move for a moment, then crosses to the
door as if to run after him, when she is stopped by the
PHONE RINGING. She picks it up.

EXT. BACK PORCH - NIGHT 28

Francesca sits on the porch with a book in her lap, gazing
out over the pasture. It's a hot night. She opens the
top of her robe a bit. Feeling the air against her skin,
she decides to open it a bit more. She gets an idea.

Standing, she looks to see if anyone is around -- though
rationally she knows there isn't a soul for miles. She
turns off the porch light. With a brave and daring
impulse, she sheds her bathrobe and stands naked under
the night sky. The air feels good against her body. She
opens her arms up against the night sky and moon like an
Indian priestess.

Suddenly, she starts hitting her body as mosquitoes begin
attacking her bare torso. Thwarted, she quickly covers
herself with a robe and runs into the house.

CUT TO:

INT. FRANCESCA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 29

Francesca is in front of a full-length mirror, her robe
opened, applying Calomine lotion to insect bites.
Suddenly, she stops to notice her body.

CAMERA ANGLES OVER her shoulder. It is the first time in
years she has actually stopped to look and touch her body,
running her hands gently over her curves, her neck, down
the side of her thighs, her face, her breasts. She stops.
She closes her robe and shuts off the light. She sits on
the bed. .

She gets an idea and crosses to a jewelry box on her
bureau. She searches through it, then removes a section
to reveal another compartment. It is filled with things
she hasn't worn in years -- out of date earrings, pins,
etc... Lying amongst these items is an Italian-looking
medallion on a chain. She holds it lovingly and puts it
on. Crossing to the window, she looks out and she sees
the water pump Robert used that day.

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 30

Francesca sits in her bathrobe at a writing table with a

the collie runs’ ahead.

EXT. ROSEMAN BRIDGE - NIGHT 31

The car headlights light the way as Francesca walks bare-
foot towards the bridge. Jack lopes on ahead, checking
things out. .

Francesca tacks the note for Robert to the bridge. She
considers taking it down a moment later, but decides not
to. She gets back into her car and drives away.

ROBERT
Got your note. W.B. Yeats as
messenger and all that. I'm sorry
I didn't call sooner, but I just
read it. I stuffed the note into
my pocket because the light was
fading and I had to get my shots.

FRANCESCA

The light was fading.

ROBERT
I accept the invitation, but it
might be late. The weather's
pretty good, so I'm planning on
shooting the Holliwell Bridge
this evening. It could be after
nine before I'm finished. Is
that all right?

Francesca frowns but manages to keep her voice from
betraying her disappointment.

FRANCESCA
Oh sure, get your work done;
that's what's important. I'll fix
something that'll be easy to warm
up when you get here.

ROBERT
If you want to come along while
I'm shooting, that's fine. It

INT. SLOW BEND SALOON/RESTAURANT - DAY ‘ 40

One of two eating establishments in Winterset. A lunch
time crowd fills the place. Robert is seated at the
counter. He can sense their eyes on him, wondering who
this stranger is and what's he doing here. He knows the
whispered conversation is about him.

A MIDDLE-AGED COUPLE talk at table.

WIFE
Thelma told me he checked into the
Motor Inn and the bill goes to
ional aphic M ine.

HUSBAND

pygmies to take pictures of.

WIFE
He's takin' pictures of the
bridges.

HUSBAND

Ain't no pygmies there either.

Robert: wants to finish his lunch as quickly as possible.

At that moment, someone enters the restaurant and all the
conversation stops. He overhears one WAITRESS turn to a

SECOND WAITRESS and whisper --

WAITRESS
God. It's Lucy Redfield.

WAITRESS #2
(whispering back)
Apparently Mrs. Delaney caught
them.

The First Waitress gasps.

WAITRESS #2°
Ran right into them in Des Moines
in the middle of her shopping.

Robert's curiosity gets the better of him and he subtly
turns his head to see:

The REDFIELD WOMAN. But instead of being the harlot we
might think, she's actually a rather plain, demure-
locking woman.

As she crosses to the counter, Robert immediately picks
up on the vibes in the room. He notices all the patrons
stare, then turn away to whisper. The Waitress behind
the counter ignores her while the Second Waitress

heads to the kitchen. A customer eating at the counter
places a bag on an empty stool beside her, so the
Redfield Woman can't sit down near her.

Robert and the Redfield Woman's eyes meet. She is clearly
uncomfortable. She turns, about to leave, when Robert
clears his cameras off a stool next to him and offers:

ROBERT
Got room right here if you like.

She is surprised at his courtesy. Others are astounded.
Some disgusted. She accepts his offer and sits beside
him.

REDFIELD WOMAN
Thank you.

ROBERT
Hot out there today.

She nods and smiles. The Waitress tosses a menu at her
and slams down a glass of water, then moves on down the
counter. The Redfield Woman tries to act casual, glancing
through the menu. Robert subtly scans the room as all
eyes are on them, then turns away.

Robert returns his glance back to the Redfield Woman who
is now only pretending to read the menu. She is so
embarrassed. She wants to leave but can't move.

WAITRESS
Well, are you ordering anything!?

Her harsh tone startles the Redfield Woman as well as
Robert. Gathering her dignity, she responds:

REDFIELD WOMAN
No. Thank you. I've changed my
mind.

She politely nods to Robert, gathers her things and exits.
Robert looks to the Waitress, as the Second Waitress
ENTERS FRAME.

- WAITRESS #2
I'd've thrown that water right in
her face.

WAITRESS
Poor Mrs. Delaney.

The Waitress walks 0.S., leaving the Second Waitress
facing Robert, who looks at her curiously. The Second
Waitress looks back as if to say, "What business is it
of yours?" and exits.

With this, the dam bursts --

CASHIER
Tragic is more like it. The pain
that woman has been subjected to
by that no-good husband. I never
liked him. Known him for years.
People say he's quiet. Well, it's
the quiet ones that can sneak up
behind you and stab you in the
back. I-heard yesterday, that she
confronted him. Gave him the
ultimatum and you know what he
did?

Robert stands astounded, listening to this diatribe of
gossip.

Robert comes around Main Street to get into his truck when
he sees a 1957 Chevrolet a few spaces down from his. The
Redfield Woman is sitting behind the wheel, the windows

Francesca sits in her slip, alone in a dressing room,
with several dresses strewn about. The panic of inde-

Or perhaps she's imagining something that isn't there.

I mean, I'm just buying a dress.
It's not a special occasion or
anything. I'm just shopping.
Just shopping for a new dress,

Robert is already there, working. He checks his watch,
anxious for Francesca to arrive, when he hears a car
driving up. He looks to see Francesca stop and get out.
By their expressions we can tell how glad they are to see
each other.

He extends his hand. She pauses, then takes it. He leads
her to the bridge.

CAMERA begins to PULL BACK and HOLD ON the scene. Kincaid
is in his element, moving about with ease as he works to
capture the gorgeous light. Francesca is enjoying
watching this performance -- his grace, the way the
muscles in his forearms are working, the way he moves

his body. As Kincaid moves into the creek and then up
the other bank, she walks through the bridge to the other
side. When she comes out the other end, he is crouched
down and pointing a camera toward her. He shoots three
shots in rapid succession as Francesca walks toward him.
She grins in mild embarrassment. Robert smiles back and

Francesca is busy preparing dinner. Robert enters,

FRANCESCA
Actually no. I've got everything

Yes, that'd be nice.

Robert gets her one.

Francesca lounges in a tub with a beer poured into a wine
glass. She finds it very elegant. She takes a deep
breath, watching a few drops of water fall from the shower
head.

FRANCESCA (V.0.)
I realized that he had been here
just a few minutes before. I was
lying where the water had run down

Robert is at the radio when Francesca enters in her new
dress. She looks beautiful. And it's all over Robert's
face.

FRANCESCA
What's wrong?

Robert's voice is a little shaky, a little rough, but his
admiration is genuine.

ROBERT
If you don't mind my boldness, you
look stunning. Make-me-run-around-
the-block-howling~in-agony
stunning.

She smiles and meets his gaze, reveling for a monent in
his reaction.

On the RADIO, we hear DINAH WASHINGTON begin to sing, "If
It's The Last Thing I Do" -- a heautiful, bluesy lovesong.

The PHONE RINGS. Francesca makes no move to answer it on
the first RING, or the second. In the long silence
between the second and third RINGS, Robert takes a deep
breath and looks down at his camera bags.

Francesca is finally able to move across the kitchen to
answer the phone. Robert quietly takes a seat, his back
to Francesca. The SONG PLAYS throughout.

FRANCESCA
Hello? ... Hi, Madge.

Francesca reaches out, casually smoothes out the collar
on Robert's shirt, then leaves her hand on his shoulder.

FRANCESCA
Huh-huh... Nothing, just making
myself some dinner... No, what?...

Oh... I heard about him. Yeah, I
hear he's some kind of
photographer.

She can feel the muscle running from his neck along his
shoulder to the back of his collarbone. She is conscious
of how warm his body feels through his shirt. Madge
babbles on.

FRANCESCA
No, I didn't... Huh-huh...
Hippie? I don't know, is that

called so I better run... No, they
don't get home until Friday
morning... Well, maybe I'll give

you a call. Okay. Bye.

Francesca hangs up, reluctant to move her hand from his
shoulder. Robert takes it in his, rises and turns to
face her. He slips his free hand around her waist.

They begin to dance to the song. The kitchen lights

have not been turned on since the sun went down. The sky,
a dark orange and magenta, illuminates the room through
the window. They never take their eyes off each other.

ROBERT
You're shaking. Are you cold?.

Francesca shakes her head. They dance a bit more, but
Francesca is shaking, which makes it difficult. They
both stop.

Robert places his huge hands on either side of Her face,
gently stroking her hair away from her cheek. He
whispers:

ROBERT
If you want me _ to stop, tell me

Dow.

He brushes his cheek and face softly against hers.
Francesca rubs hers barely breathing.

ROBERT
Francesca -- I won't be sorry. I
won't apologize for this.

FRANCESCA
Nobody's asked you to.

They kiss. Hands gently explore. . Their bodies touch.
Their lips never spend more than seconds away from each,
other. Robert slides his hands down her breasts and
torso, exploring every inch of her. Francesca grips
his massive back, sliding up to his neck and hair.
Robert lifts her leg and presses it against his hip,
kissing her neck and shoulders. Francesca starts to
lose herself, clutching his head to her breast, then
pulling him up to her mouth once again.

in his arms. He holds her. She closes her eyes.

FRANCESCA
Take me somewhere.
ROBERT
What?
FRANCESCA
Right now. Tell me someplace
you've been -- someplace on the

other side of the world.

ROBERT
(thinks, then)
How about Italy?

FRANCESCA
Yes.

ROBERT
How about Bari?

FRANCESCA
Yes. Tell me about the day. you
got off the train.

ROBERT
Have you ever been to that
station?

FRANCESCA
Yes.

ROBERT

You know that little place nearby
with the striped awning that sells
arraccinos...

FRANCESCA
(excited)

it!

I sat outside and had coffee.

Near the church.

I sat there once. It was hot.
Like today. I'd been shopping.
I had all these bags around my
feet I kept having to move every
time the waiter came by...

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. JOHNSON FARM - DAWN 53

Francesca and Robert are making love outdoors in an area
far behind the house hidden by corn stalks...

The two transport themselves together to another place,
where there are no familial memories surrounding them
to interfere.

CUT TO:

EXT. JOHNSON PORCH - MORNING 54

The two sit in bathrobes on the porch looking out over
the pasture. They have bowls of oatmeal on their laps.
They eat voraciously.

Robert leans over, picks a pot up off the porch and
ladles some more onto his plate. Too much falls out and
it spills onto the robe. Francesca giggles. Robert
glares at her jokingly. ,

Francesca hands him a dish rag. Robert wipes off the
food revealing his bare leg. She reaches over and
touches it. He looks at her and smiles. She leans over
and kisses him passionately until, suddenly, she pulls
away. She looks upset. She rises and moves away to look
out to the pasture. Robert can sense what is wrong.

FRANCESCA
I feel like I'm getting a little
out of control. It's kind of
frightening.

FRANCESCA (V.0.)
I had thoughts about him I hardly
knew what to do with. And he
read every one. Whatever I felt,
whatever I wanted, he gave
himself up to. And in that
Moment, everything I knew to be
true about myself up until then
was gone. I was acting like
another woman ~- yet I was more
myself than ever before.

Francesca looks at him and understands he is giving her
full permission to explore whatever she wants.
Hesitantly, she crosses to him and takes his plate away.

She stands before him, leaning Rim back into his chair.
She slowly, tentatively, opens her robe.

EXT. MADISON COUNTY ROAD - DAY 55

Francesca and Robert are driving, smoking cigarettes and
listening to MUSIC. :

FRANCESCA (V.0.)
'We decided to spend Wednesday
away from Winterset. Away from
Madison County. Away from
pastures and bridges and people
too familiar and reminders too
painful. We let the day take us
where it wanted...'

EXT. IOWA COUNTRYSIDE - DAY 56

The truck is parked against a breathtaking vista.
Francesca and Robert sit on the ground nearby eating
lunch as Robert shows Francesca a collection of some of
his photographs. They are beautiful and show a wide
range of skill.

FRANCESCA
Oh, that one is beautiful. Look
at their expressions. As if the
camera weren't on them at all.
They're not photographs -- they're

captured in moments. You should
be published. Your own

ROBERT
It's no big heartache. Whatever
makes an artist look like an
artist to the world -- is just a
feature I don't have.

FRANCESCA
Maybe you have to convince -

. yourself first. Maybe you do

have to ask why it's an obsession.

He smiles and considers what she is saying. She takes
the chain with her medallion off from around her neck and
puts it on Robert.

ROBERT
What's this?

FRANCESCA
I remembered I had this, the other
night after you left. It was made
in Assisi. My aunt gave it to me
on my seventh birthday.

Robert looks at the medallion with "For Francesca”
engraved on it. He is very moved and nods gratefully.

CUT TO:

EXT. IOWA ROAD - TWILIGHT 57

The truck drives up to a roadhouse.

INT. ROADSIDE BLUES JOINT - NIGHT 58

Francesca and Robert enter the smoke-filled roadhouse.
No one would recognize them here because it is an all-
black club. Only slight notice of the couple is taken
as they sit at a table and order drinks. Francesca is
loving it -- she can't take it in fast enough -- bodies
dancing, laughing, the band jamming. It's like she
stepped into another world.

SAME LOCATION - LATER

Over drinks, they talk. ~ .

FRANCESCA
What were you like when you were
younger?

ROBERT
(smiles)
Trouble. Why?

FRANCESCA
(laughs )
I just wondered. Why were you
trouble?

ROBERT
I had a temper.

FRANCESCA
What were your parents like?

Pause. Robert doesn't reply. She looks at him
curiously.

FRANCESCA
What?

ROBERT
I can't do this. I'm sorry.

FRANCESCA
What?

ROBERT

Try and live a lifetime before
Friday. Cram it all in.

Shakes his head. This is the first time either has men-
tioned their time clock. Francesca nods, understandably.

A black female blues singer is on stage singing "If It's
the Last Thing I Do." Robert gestures for Francesca to
take his hand and he leads her onto the dance floor.

time is running out.

CUT TO:

INT. JOHNSON HOUSE - NIGHT 59

Robert is in the living room making up the floor again
with blankets and pillows. Francesca enters. He stops.
She extends her hand. He takes it and she leads him
upstairs. He stops before they ascend.

ROBERT
Are you sure?

Francesca nods and brings him upstairs to her bedroom.

INT. JOHNSON BEDROOM - NIGHT 60

Francesca guides Robert into bed beneath the covers.

They begin to make love -- softly, lovingly -- like a
couple that are beyond the erotic, discovéry stage; a
couple that have been together and in love for years.

EXT. SIDE PORCH OF JOHNSON HOUSE -. NIGHT 61

Carolyn sits on the porch with the notebook on her lap,
thinking to herself. She decides she needs a cigarette
and searches through her bag. Finding her pack and
lighter, she stops -- simultaneously discovering a
business card from a matrimonial lawyer; pre-nups,
divorce, estate planning. She fingers the card in her
hand, pauses, then looks up upon hearing Michael's car
return home.

CAROLYN

Hillcrest Road?

CAROLYN :
Yeah. But I thought she died.

MICHAEL
He remarried. Apparently they
were having an affair for years.
Apparently the first Mrs. Delaney
was a bit of a stiff.

CAROLYN
You mean -- she didn't like sex?

MICHAEL
(nods, then simply)
I bet Mom could've helped her.

CAROLYN
Boy. All these years I've
‘resented not living the wild life
in some place like Paris and all
the time I could've moved back to
Iowa... Are you drunk?

MICHAEL
Not yet. You want to get out of
here for awhile?

CAROLYN
I think I better.

62 EXT. IOWA LAKEFRONT - NIGHT 62

Michael and Carolyn have parked in a secluded area near a
lake. Some place where the moonlight and the scenery
create a beautiful backdrop. They sit on the ground,
leaving the headlights and the RADIO ON. They are get-

But I was crazy about her. And
for about three months, I managed
to catch her during her
‘exploring’ stage.

CAROLYN
I never knew that.

MICHAEL
(sadly)
Nobody did.

CAROLYN
Was this during Betty?

MICHAEL
Everything was during Betty. God,
we were So young. Why did we think
we had to do it all so fast? I've
never cheated on Betty. Not once
we were married, I mean.

CAROLYN
Did you want to?

MICHAEL
Only about a thousand times.
What do I do now? ‘What's good

made love to me so intensely that
he transported me to Africa, for
Christ's sakes -- quite frankly I
don't think he ever did! And now
I find out that in between bake
sales, my mother was Anais Nin!

MICHAEL
What about me! I feel really
weird. Like she cheated on me,
not Dad. Isn't that sick? You
know, being the only son, you sort
of feel like you're the prince of
the kingdom. And in the back of
your mind, you kind of think your
mother doesn't need sex anymore
because she has you.

CAROLYN
You're right -- that is sick.

They drink.

MICHAEL
If she was so unhappy, why didn't
she leave?

They look to each other without an answer. Then simul-
taneously they reach for the notebooks.

MICHAEL
Can I read it now?

Carolyn offers him the book, then lays back in a relaxed
position in order to listen. Michael flips to an ear-
marked page.

Francesca is serving Robert breakfast, then sits down
beside him. Silence. We can sense some tension between
them -- this being their last day together. Francesca
seems ingenuously friendly. Robert is suspicious.

FRANCESCA
Sleep all right?

ROBERT
Yes, thanks.

FRANCESCA

Good. More coffee?

she pours)

Why is that up to me? You're the

you have no intention of leaving
your husband.

FRANCESCA
To do what? Be with someone who
needs everyone and no one in
particular? I mean, what would
be the point. Would you pass the
butter?

ROBERT
I was honest with you.

FRANCESCA

Yes. Absolutely. You have this
habit of not needing and that
it's hard to break. I understand.

Of course, in that case, why

FRANCESCA

After you leave, I'm going to

my life what happened here. If
anything happened at all! And
I'll have to wonder if you find

sink. Francesca reaches for him but he pulls away,
embarrassed.

FRANCESCA
(softly)

Don't you see, I’ve got to know
the truth, Robert. I've got to
know the truth or I'll go crazy.
Either way. Just tell me. But I
can't act like this is enough
because it has to be. I can't

Robert turns to face her. He is so hopelessly in love he
can hardly find the words. His eyes fill up with tears.

ROBERT
Because... if I asked myself
right now why I make pictures,
the only reason I could come up
with -- the only reason it seems
I've been anywhere and done
anything -- was to bring me here.
Right now it looks like the only
thing I’ve done all my life was
to make my way to you. And if I

even think about tomorrow -- if I

without you -- I'm not sure I --

He shakes his head. He can't even finish. He kneels
down before her, wrapping his arms around her and burying

his face into her body. Francesca starts to cry -- out
of happiness, out of pain -- holding onto him as if for
dear life.
FRANCESCA
Oh, God... what are we going to do?

She kisses him -- over and over, not wanting to be even
an inch apart. As if any space between them might
separate them forever. :

Suddenly, 0.S., they hear a CAR DRIVE UP to the house.
They panic. Francesca runs to the window to see:

MADGE, a girlfriend, has come for a visit. Madge is
holding a homemade dessert.

FRANCESCA
No. No. Where's your truck?
ROBERT
Behind the barn. I better go.
Francesca turns to him -- speechless -- not wanting him
ta go.

Don't worry. I meant upstairs.

He exits. Francesca gathers herself and heads for the

boy. I said --

-- 'Floyd, I'm going to visit my
girlfriend and spend the afternoon
and that's all there is to it.’
He said, 'Who's going to make
lunch? I said, ‘I'm taking a
sick day. Eat at the diner' --
isn't that hilarious.

(moves into kitchen)
He didn't dare raise an eyebrow
-- I don't even want to tell you
how late he was out last night
with those good-for-nothings from
the Sandford ranch. I am so
sorry, honey, I let two days pass
before I came by but with the boy
home the time just escapes me.
Have you heard from Richard?
How's the fair? God, it's hot.

You want me to call the doctor?

guides her to lie down. Once she's in his arms, he
speaks.

ROBERT
Come with me.

Francesca knew he was going to say this. Either answer

She turns to him and they embrace. Robert, however,
fears only one response.

MUSIC PLAYS OVER the next few images. CAMERA SLOWLY PANS

preparing dinner. He stands at the sink rinsing out some
utensils. Waiting for the water to turn hot, he looks
out THROUGH the window above the sink. He sees a beauti-

this is a view Francesca has seen a million times -- that
soon She would not see ever again.

Francesca packs to leave. She is wearing a red dress,
with buttons down the front.

She moves about the room as if with blinders on --

memories that might hinder her. Francesca tries to open
one of the bureau drawers and it gees stuck. She pauses

Pause. Robert takes another sip. Then, knowing full
well what hangs heavy between them, he asks:

ROBERT
You're not coming with me, are

Francesca stops pretending to eat. She looks at him,
having forgotten how well he can read her.

FRANCESCA
No matter how I keep turning it
around in my mind -- it doesn't

FRANCESCA
No, they don't say much. But
Carolyn's 16. She's just about
to find out about all this for
herself -- she's going to fall
in love, she’s going to try and
figure out how to build a life
with someone. If I leave, what
does that say to her?

ROBERT
What about us?

FRANCESCA
You've got to know deep down that
the minute we leave here, it'll
all change.

ROBERT

Yeah. It could get better.

FRANCESCA
No matter how much distance we put
between us and this house, I bring
it with me... and I'll feel it

two separate people anymore.
Some people search their whole
lives for it and wind up alone
-- most people don't even think
it exists and you're going to
tell me that giving it up is
the right thing to do?

FRANCESCA
We are the choices we've made,
Robert.

Robert rises and turns his back on her.

FRANCESCA
Robert. Please.
(desperate)
You don't understand -- no one

does. When a woman makes the
choice to marry, to have children
-- in one way her life begins but
in another way it stops. You
build a life of details. You
become a mother, a wife and you
stop and stay steady so that your
children can move. And when they
leave they take your life of
details with them. And then
you're expected to move again
only you don’t remember what
moves you because no one has
asked in so long. Not even
yourself. You never in your

life think that love like this
can happen to you.

ROBERT
But now that you have it --

She embraces him. He wraps his arms around her. He
whispers.

Don't leave me. Don't leave me
alone. Please,

This breaks her heart, knowing how hard it is for him to
say this. She holds him tighter, until --

ROBERT
Listen. Maybe you feel this way,
maybe you don't. Maybe it's just

Maybe... maybe when they come back
tomorrow you'll feel differently.
Don't you think that's possible?

look back. He gets in, STARTS IT UP and drives away.

Francesca exits the house and watches the truck recede
into the distance. She stops when she reaches the front
gate, leaning against it. She murmurs to herself --

FRANCESCA
Keep going. Please.

The truck drives away. Then, suddenly, stops.
Francesca's heart quickens. She watches as the truck
stands on the road in the distance.

As if Robert was deciding to turn around or keep going.
Francesca waits. Suddenly, the door to the truck flies
open and Robert exits. Francesca loses all restraint.

She opens the gate but her dress is caught on it. Robert
stands by the truck. Francesca tears at the dress,
ripping off a button which falls to the ground. She runs
down the road. Seeing her, Robert runs towards her as
well.

They grab each other furiously. For these few moments,
all considerations are gone.

CAMERA PANS UP TO the road beyond Robert's truck.

We see Richard's truck driving towards them. For a

moment it seems as if they will be caught until we

realize Richard's truck is being SUPERIMPOSED as the

light gradually brightens to reveal:

EXT. JOHNSON HOUSE ~- MORNING 72

Richard, Michael and Carolyn drive down the road toward
the house.

Robert's truck, and all traces of him are gone.

Francesca steps into the doorway in a house-dress to
welcome her family home -- wondering how this will feel.

INT. JOHNSON KITCHEN - EVENING 73
The Johnson family has dinner as Francesca narrates:

FRANCESCA (V.0.)
You all came home. And with you,
my life of details.

CUT TO:

EXT. JOHNSON HOUSE - DAY 74
Everyone is doing various daily chores,

FRANCESCA (V.0.)
A day or two passed and with each
thought of him, a task would
present itself like a life saver,
. pulling me further and further
away from those four days.

Francesca is reading. Richard watches TV.

A light rain is beginning to fall.

Richard and Francesca drive up to the general store to
buy groceries. Francesca heads for the store as Richard
crosses the street. :

Okay.
She enters the store.
INT. GENERAL STORE - DAY 77

Francesca makes small talk with the grocery lady as she
buys what she needs.

CUT TO:

EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY 78
The rain has gotten heavier.

Francesca places a bag of groceries on the front seat of
the truck, then gets in herself to wait for Richard. She
takes a deep breath and removes a handkerchief from her
bag to wipe the raindrops from her face. She freezes --

THROUGH the windshield, she sees Robert standing in the
rain beside his truck across the street, staring at her.
Her heart stops. For a moment, she isn't even sure he's
real. .

The town moves about its business around them. But
neither notice or care. Whatever safety or forgetfulness
she felt is gone. Her feelings burst through. She sits
there helpless before him -- willing to go or stay
depending on what he did.

He begins walking towards her. She prepares herself.
Her life will change -- it has to. There's no turning
back.

But the closer Robert gets, the clearer he can see that
she is crying. And he stops.

Without any words, he realizes what taking her with him
would mean. With just a glance, he sacrifices her. With
their eyes locked in the middle of Main Street -- in
front of the whole town -- they smile and say goodbye.

Robert returns to his truck. He drives off, down Main
Street.

Moments later, Richard throws the feed bag into the back
of his truck and gets in. Francesca is wiping her eyes.

He doesn't notice. He drives off in the same direction
as Robert.

FRANCESCA (V.0.)
For a moment, I didn't know where
Iwas. And for a split second,
the thought crossed my mind that
he really didn't want me -- that
it was easy to walk away.

EXT. WINTERSET STREET - DAY 78A

Their momentum brings them up right behind the old pick-
up, and sitting high in the Chevy, Francesca can see a
black tarpaulin lashed down tight in the back, outlining
a suitcase and guitar case wedged in next to the spare
tire lying flat. The back window is rain-spattered but
part of his head is visible.

FRANCESCA (V.0.)
Robert leaned over as if to get
something from the glove box.
Eight days ago he'd done that and
his arm had brushed across my leg.
A week ago I had been in Des
Moines buying a new dress.

RICHARD
That truck's a long way from home.
Washington State. I'11 bet it's
that photographer they been
talkin’ about at the cafe.

Francesca doesn't respond. She is struggling to fight
back her tears.

EXT. TWO-WAY STOP - DAY 78B

They follow Kincaid a few blocks north to where 169
intersects with 92 running east to west. It is a two-
way stop with heavy cross traffic, complicated by the
rain. .

(CONTINUED )

OL.

CONTINUED: 78B
For maybe twenty seconds they sit there.
Francesca's hand moves to the door handle.

FRANCESCA (V.O.)
Since Robert Kincaid had driven
away from me last Friday, I
realized, in spite of how much I
thought I'd cared for him then, I
had nonetheless badly
underestimated my feelings. That
didn't seem possible, but it was
true. I had begun to understand
what he already understood.

Francesca sits frozen by her responsibilities, staring at
that back window harder than she has ever looked at
anything in her life.

RICHARD
What's he waiting for?

Francesca looks up to see that traffic has cleared in
all directions. But Robert doesn't move. Francesca
knows he is going through the same thing as she is in
that moment. And then she sees:

Robert, knowing Francesca is watching, takes off the
medallion and hangs it on his rear-view mirror --
touching it gently, as if he were touching her.

Richard BEEPS his HORN lightly. But Robert's truck just
sits there. Francesca's eyes begin to tear up. Her hand
grips the door handle. She doesn't have the strength to
stay -- and she doesn’t have the strength to leave.

Suddenly, Kincaid's left signal light comes on. In a
moment he'll be gone.

Richard fiddles with the Chevy's RADIO.

Robert slowly eases his old pickup into the intersection
heading west, lowering his window to help with visibility.
Francesca squints through her tears and the rain and fog
and sees the faded red paint on the door: "Kincaid
Photography -- Bellingham, Washington.”

As Robert completes the turn, Francesca can see his hair
blowing in the wind from the open window. He begins to
accelerate down 92 and rolls up the window.

FRANCESCA (V.0.)
'Oh, Christ -- oh, Jesus Christ
Almighty... no!'

FRANCESCA (V.0.) (CONT'D)

The words were inside of me. 'I

stay... but I can't go. Let me

tell you again why I can't go...

Tell me again why I should go.' I
heard his voice coming back down

the highway...

ROBERT (V.0O.)
This kind of certainty comes only
once, and never again, no matter
how many lifetimes you live.

Richard takes the truck across the intersection heading
north. Francesca looks for a moment past his face toward
the old pickup's red taillights moving off into the
distance. A huge SEMI-TRAILER RIG ROARS into Winterset,
spraying a wave of water over the last cowboy.

FRANCESCA
(whispers )
Goodbye, Robert Kincaid.

She begins to cry openly. Richard looks over at her.

RICHARD
What's wrong, Franny? Will you
please tell me what's wrong with
you?

FRANCESCA
Richard, I just need some time to
myself. I'll be alright in a few
minutes.

Richard TUNES IN to the NOON LIVESTOCK REPORTS, looks
over at her and shakes his head.

CUT TO:

EXT. JOHNSON HOUSE - DAY 79

The rain is beginning to back off. Richard's truck
drives up. Francesca steps out with her bag of groceries
and walks briskly into the house. Richard follows more
slowly with his bag of feed, stopping at the gate to pick
up the button from Francesca's red dress.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY 80

Francesca enters and places her groceries on the counter.
She tries to compose herself. She sees the RADIO before
her. She turns it ON. The DINAH WASHINGTON SONG, "I'll
Close My Eyes" evokes every feeling of love and loss
within her. She begins to cry.

She hears Richard enter the house. She stands out of
sight, holding her hand to her mouth to muffle her
crying. She hears:

MICHAEL (0.S.)
Dad! You bought the wrong feed!

RICHARD (0.S.)
What?!

She hears Richard exit the house.

CUT TO:

INT. KITCHEN - EVENING . , 81
At dinner, Richard remembers the button he found.

RICHARD
Oh, Franny, is this yours?

Francesca sees the button. She speaks to Richard MOS.
The scene continues and her narration is heard:

FRANCESCA (V.0.)
I almost told him. In that moment
I felt as if I couldn't hold it
“back. If he really loved me,
maybe he'd understand.

She returns to her meal. The family eats in silence.

FRANCESCA (V.0.)
I was grateful for the silence
that night. I realized love won't
obey our expectations. Its
mystery is pure and absolute.
What Robert and I had, could not
continue if we were together.
What Richard and I shared would
vanish if we were apart. But how
I wanted to share this. How would
our lives have changed if I had?
Could anyone else have seen the
beauty of it?

INT. JOHNSON KITCHEN - NIGHT 82

Francesca moves about the kitchen with a frantic pace as
she puts the finishing touches on a cake. Placing the
frosting bowl in the sink, she hears SOMEONE UPSTAIRS
exiting their bedroom. She quickly gathers the cake and
her bag and exits through the screen door.

CUT To:

EXT. JOHNSON HOUSE - NIGHT 83

Fighting tears, she walks to the TRUCK from around the
house. She gets in and STARTS it. She vaguely hears
her daughter from the front door:

CAROLYN
Mom?

But she doesn't acknowledge it and drives away.

CUT TO:

EXT. LUCY REDFIELD'S HOUSE - NIGHT 84

A hand knocks on a door. LUCY REDFIELD opens it to find
Francesca standing there with a cake.

FRANCESCA
Hi. I'm Francesca Johnson. I
just feel awful that I haven't
come to visit sooner. I hope I'm
not interrupting anything. Is it
too late?

Lucy is shocked and moved at the same time.

LUCY
No. Not at all.
FRANCESCA
I was wondering if... maybe you'd

like some company.
(almost manic)
I baked a cake!

Lucy looks at the cake. She's a little dazed by all
this.

LUCY
Uh... sure. Please. Come in.
I'll make coffee.
Francesca enters. Lucy closes the door.

Michael continues reading beside Carolyn as the sun

MICHAEL
'We became inseparable, Lucy and
I. The funny thing is, I didn’t
tell her about Robert until years
later. But,-for some reason,
being with her somehow made me
feel it was safe to think about
him. The town loved talking
about the two of us but we didn't
care. And neither did your
father. Which I thought was a
lovely thing. I received
Robert's letter and my photograph
soon after. I always wondered if
your father found them. I was

An older Francesca cares for a sickly Richard. He lies
in bed beside an array of medicines and tonics. She
wipes his forehead with a cool cloth as he takes his
pills.

FRANCESCA
Better?

He nods. She smiles. She shuts off the light and lies
beside him.

RICHARD
Franny?

FRANCESCA
Hmmm?

RICHARD

I just want to say... I know you
had your own dreams. I'm sorry I
couldn't give them to you. I
love you so much.

Francesca turns to him. She is so touched, tears fill
her eyes. She nestles close to him, wrapping her arms
around him.

FRANCESCA (V.0.)
-After your father died, I tried
to get in touch with Robert but
found out he had left the
National Geographic. No’ one
seemed to know where he was. My
only connections to him were the
places we'd been to that one day.
And so each year on, on my
birthday, I'd re-visit them.

Francesca greets a UPS man with an envelope and a
package.

FRANCESCA (V.0O.)
And then one day, I received the
letter from his attorney, with a
package.

INT. JOHNSON LIVING ROOM 89

Francesca reads the letter informing her of Robert's
death. She then unwraps the package to reveal a
medallion with her name inscribed and a photography book;
a published collection of black-and-white photos by
Robert Kincaid entitled Four Days.

Pressed between two pages, the note Francesca left for
Robert on Roseman Bridge. We only see the words "white
moths are on the wing." On the front page there reads an
inscription, "FOR F.":

ROBERT (V.0.)
'There is a pleasure in the
pathless woods... there is a
rapture on the lonely shore...
There is society where none
intrudes... By the deep sea and
music in its roar... I love not

Michael and Carolyn enter. He rummages through the —
cupboard, finding that bottle of brandy, now almost ~

empty.
MICHAEL

There is enough for two drinks.
Want one?

CAROLYN
Yes.

Michael takes the only two brandy glasses from the
cupboard and sets them on the yellow Formica table. He
empties Francesca's last bottle of brandy into them. The
notebooks are closed, but Francesca’s narration continues
over the next few scenes.

FRANCESCA (V.0.)
There has not been a day since

He looks at them lovingly, then at Betty, who angrily
motions for him to follow her into the bedroom.

She slams the door behind him and talks in an irate
whisper:

BETTY
You have been out all night long!
Do I have a right to ask where
you've been?

Michael just looks at her. He gently takes her hand and
kisses it.
