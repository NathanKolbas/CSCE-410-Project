"SOME KIND OF WONDERFUL

 

BLACK SCREEN

MUSIC. STRINGS. Deep and dark. Distant voices.

EXT. TRAIN YARD

A young man is walking along the tracks. A slow, aimless
walk. Lost and lonely. A setting sun at his back. He's
handsome in a rugged, dangerous way. Denim and leather.
A great sadness and confusion on his face. His name is

KEITH NELSON.

DRUMS OBLITERATE THE STRINGS, and we RETURN TO BLACK and
TITLES BEGIN.

FADE IN:
INT. BEDROOM - GIRL
She's playing drums to the TRACK. Hard, serious. With
great purpose and need. She's boyish and tough. Her
prettiness is intentionally buried beneath acres of atti-
tude. This is WATTS. DRUMMER GIRL.

FADE TO BLACK.
TITLES CONTINUE
FADE IN:
INT. BEDROOM - CLOSE - BOY AND GIRL
Beautiful girl, handsome boy. Perfection meets perfection.
Making-out against the yellow slatted light of a darkened
bedroom. She's AMANDA JONES. He's HARDY JENNS.

FADE TO BLACK.
TITLES CONTINUE TO END
EXT. TRACKS - TRAIN
A freight train is thundering down the tracks. A HORN BLASTS.
The speeding bulk dominates the FRAME. The SOUND of DIESEL
ENGINES and CHATTERING TRACK obliterates the MUSIC.

EXT. TRACKS

The boy we saw before, Keith Nelson, continues down the track.
He looks up.

CONTINUED:

HIS POV

The train is bearing down on him.
EXT. TRACKS - ANOTHER ANGLE

BEHIND Keith TO SEE that he's walking into the approaching
train. The HORN BLASTS AGAIN.

CLOSEUP - KEITH

Watching the train. No reaction. A collision with the train
will only give him what he wants. Change.

HIS POV

The train shudders and rocks on the track. The HORN BLASTS
AND HOLDS.

CLOSEUP - KEITH
Still no change in expression.
EXT. TRACKS - KEITH AND THE TRAIN

FROM BEHIND Keith. The train FILLS THE FRAME. It's nearly
on him. He steps out off the tracks at the last moment.

EXT. TRACKS - SIDING

Keith heads down the embankment as the train hurtles past.
No change in expression.

EXT. LOWER MIDDLE CLASS NEIGHBORHOOD - LATE AFTERNOON

The homes of working people. Squat bungalows, clean but
modest. A black Corvette is parked in the driveway of one
of the houses. It stands out among the more utilitarian

vehicles on the street. An incongruent luxury. A front
door opens, and the boy and the girl we saw making-out in
the TITLE SEQUENCE step out of the house. Her blouse is

untucked, her hair's mussed, stocking feet. She's flushed
and floating. He's in a hurry. Done with her, on to other
things. She holds him back and kisses him. There's no
tenderness on his part. It's one-sided.

EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - ACROSS THE STREET

Keith is across the street, leaning on a lamp post. His
gritty hands wrapped around the pole. Washed but never
clean. A hint of anger, a touch of resentment. Hardy
doesn't belong in the neighborhood. Certainly doesn't de-
serve the girl.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
HIS POV

Hardy gets in his car, fires the engine and backs out of
the driveway. Amanda waves goodbye from the porch. Hardy
drops the Corvette in gear and squeals away. An irresis-
table show of disrespect for the neighborhood.

CLOSEUP - KEITH

There's something tragic about his look. Hardy has every-
thing money can buy and is now stealing the things it can't.

HIS POV
Amanda goes back in the house.
CLOSEUP - KEITH

His observation was careful and considered. He looks at
his greasy hands. Too dirty to touch her. He pushes off
the pole.

EXT. ANOTHER BLOCK IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD

A tired two story in a modest neighborhood. Clean but simple.
Maybe a little nicer than Amanda's neighborhood. But not
much. Keith cuts across the freshly mown lawn, up the drive-
way and around the back of the house.

INT. KITCHEN

Keith's mother, CAROL, is at a small built-in desk beneath

a wall phone balancing her checkbook. She's wearing nurse's
whites. She works. Dinner is on the fire. A ten-year-old
girl, CINDY, is sitting at the kitchen table. She's cata-
loguing her Garbage Pail kids in a photo album. Keith comes
in the back door. Cindy strikes.

CINDY
It's Semi-Conscious Keith.

Keith ignores her and continues through the kitchen. Carol
addresses him without looking up.

CAROL
Hi, honey. How was work?

He exits into the dining room.
CAROL
You still haven't told me when

you're going to cut your hair.

CONTINUED:
CINDY
Mom? You're flapping your lips
in vain. Keith vacated.

Carol addresses Cindy without looking up.

CAROL
Speak English, please.

INT. FOYER

Keith crosses out of the dining into the foyer. His father
calls to him from the living room.

CLIFF (V.0.)
Keith? Is that you?

Keith stops at the bottom of the stairs. He sighs. Caught.
He swings around and steps into the living room.

INT. LIVING ROOM

Keith's father, CLIFF, is sitting on the couch. Spread out
before him are university brochures.

CLOSEUP - KEITH

He looks at Cliff and the brochures. He's suspicious.
CLOSEUP - CLIFF

He speaks without looking at Keith.

CLIFF
I've been checking out colleges...

He looks up at Keith.
CLOSEUP - KEITH
Plays it flat.
KEITH

Aren't you a little too old for

college?
A thin smile breaks through.
CLOSEUP - CLIFF
An incredulous stare. Incredulous that Keith can be so
cavalier about a subject that Cliff considers vital, press-
ing and overwhelmingly serious. There's no humor to his

retort.

(CONTINUED)
17

CONTINUED:

CLIFF
If I'd gone to college, I wouldn't
be selling tires six days a week.

CLOSEUP - KEITH

He doesn't like hearing Cliff run himself down.
CLOSEUP - CLIFF

A word of warning.

CLIFF

If you don't get with the program,
you'll be selling tires, too.

(pause; lightens-

up)
You want to take a minute and look
at these brochures? A whole bunch
of new ones came in the mail today.

(sorts through

stack, finds one,

holds it up)
Take a look. Some of these are
real nice. Look at this, coed
physical education.

CLOSEUP - KEITH
The last thing he wants to do.

KEITH
Can I do it later?

CLOSEUP - CLIFF
He's been put off before.

CLIFF
I'm not trying to break your
back, I just want you to get
off the dime and think about
your future.

CLOSEUP - KEITH
He nods. He's heard it before.
CLOSEUP - CLIFF

One last thought. What's really at the heart of the college
issue.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (2)

CLIFF
You got a shot to be the first
guy in this family who didn't
have to wash his hands after a
day's work.

CLOSEUP - KEITH

He knows. All too well. He shows his hands to Cliff.
Dirty. Motor dirt. Like Cliff said. He pushes off the
door arch and heads back into the foyer. He heads up the
stairs, side-stepping the debris piled on the stairs to
be carried up at anyone's convenience.

INT. KEITH'S BEDROOM
Keith opens the door and stops cold.
HIS POV

Keith's sister, LAURA, is sitting on the floor going through
his records. LP's are out of their sleeves. She's rudely
holding an LP, looking at the label.

Keith's room is a shrine to art. It's a serious shelter
from the outside world. One wall is covered, every inch,
with reproduction posters, art show posters, art postcards,
reproductions torn from books and magazines. A collage of
the history of art. A second wall is devoted to his own
sketches. A third wall is a trompe l'oeil of an endless
marble gallery. The fourth wall is hung with his own can-
vases. A stereo carefully put together out of discarded
pieces and parts. His bed is a mattress on the floor. A
chair direct from the dump. A rug from off a curb during
spring trash pick-up day. A desk made of an old door held
up by two oil drums. The surface is covered with sketches
and india ink pens and brushes, ink bottles. Clay and plas-
ter models and studies. Everywhere are found objects,
things intended for future pieces and studies. It is an
artist's studio in a boy's bedroom. There's no question
from his surroundings that he's serious about his talent.

LAURA
I'm looking for that song about
the guy that killed himself for
the girl that hated his guts.
She looks up.
CLOSEUP - KEITH

He's furious at the intrusion.

(CONTINUED)
18

CONTINUED:
CLOSEUP - LAURA
Disregards his anger.

LAURA
Do you know which song I'm
talking about?

Keith takes the LP from Laura.

KEITH
Do you understand the concept
of privacy?

LAURA
Yes, I do. That's why I don't
let anyone in my room.

KEITH
Get out of here before I throw
your ass out the window.

LAURA
(outraged)
God, are you in a bad mood!

KEITH
Get outta here.

LAURA
Is this a side effect of being
massively unliked or...?

Keith grabs Laura by the arm, rips her to her feet, walks
her to the door and shoves her out.

CLOSEUP - LAURA
She's enraged.
LAURA
If I get a black and blue mark
you monger, you're dead!

The door slams on her. She screams at the top of her voice.

LAURA (0.C.)
Mom!

INT. DINING ROOM - LATER

The family are eating dinner. Laura is showing her upper
arm to Carol.

LAURA
Look at it. You see what he did
to me?
Carol looks.
CAROL

I don't see anything.

LAURA
Then you need glasses. If I
wanted to sit out, I couldn't
wear a bathing suit.

CINDY
Exposing your skin to sunlight
will make you old before your

time.
CLIFF
(to Laura)
You stay out of his room.
(to Keith)

You got a problem with her, see
me before you rough her up.

KEITH
What right does she have to break
into my room? And I didn't rough
her up.

LAURA
I have practically no feeling
left in the upper part of my arm.

CLIFF
Drop it.

LAURA
I wish just once you guys could
experience the humiliation of
having the weirdest guy ina
huge school be a blood relative.

CAROL
Your father said, drop it.

LAURA
This whole family revolves around

Keith. I'm sick of it.

(CONTINUED)
20

CONTINUED:
Keith sets down his fork and napkin.

CAROL
That's not true and you know it.

KEITH
(to Carol)
I'll be upstairs.

CAROL
You haven't finished your dinner.

KEITH
Excuse me.

Keith gets up and exists. Cliff calls after him.

CLIFF
What about these colleges, Keith?
(pause)
I expect an answer.

LAURA
Do you know what a total waste
of money it's going to be
letting him go to college?
He'll have this expensive
education that he'll never use
because all he wants to do is
make incredibly ugly art that
won't ever look good in anybody's
house.

Cliff, Carol and Cindy stare at her.

LAURA
Am I wrong?

INT. KEITH'S ROOM

MUSIC'S PLAYING. He's sitting at his desk looking at a
tattered photo.

CLOSEUP - PICTURE

A candid snapshot. Of a girl looking back over her shoul-
der. A caught expression on her face. A beautiful girl.
The girl we saw in the opening.

KEITH

Dips his brush in ink and applies it to paper.

CLOSEUP - PAPER

A steady hand draws the sweep of a girl's neck and shoul-
der. Another produces a fine, strong jawline.

CLOSEUP - KEITH

A hint of a smile as he looks at his first strokes. The
SOURCE MUSIC PLAYING in the room is lost to a DRUM TRACK
PLAYED AS SCORE. The DRUMS CONTINUE ACROSS the:

CUT TO:
EXT. HIGH SCHOOL
A big, traditional high school.
EXT. PARKING LOT

A battered, wasted Mini with English drive whips into the
parking lot and flies into a parking spot narrowly missing
the shiny new imports on either side of the vacant spot.
DRUMS OUT ON A CYMBAL SPLASH.

CLOSEUP - GROUND

The car door opens and a black patent-leather tie shoe,
covered with metal studs steps out of the car. We MOVE UP
FROM the shoes, PAST worn, torn jeans, a tank top, black
man's brocade vest, drum sticks shoved in a black leather
belt, red kid gloves and a cheap digital watch on a metal
stretch band shoved halfway up the arm to the girl we saw
in the opening. She's Watts, Drummer Girl. Big breathless
smile enjoying the rush of a near miss, the affirmation of
life that comes from a challenge to it. She takes off her
tiny red sunglasses and looks in the car.

DRUMMER GIRL
Are you aware of how close that
was?
INT. CAR
Keith looks up at her. He's annoyed with her driving.
The answer to her question is on his face. He can't help

but smile at her exhilaration. He picks up his books off
the seat and gets out.

EXT. PARKING LOT

Keith gets out of the car. He has to squeeze out. Drummer
Girl's parked a bit close on his side.

DRUMMER GIRL
Imagine what I can do when I get
my driver's license back.

She gives him a big smile and twirls her drumsticks.
EXT. PARKING LOT

Hardy Jenns and a couple of his friends are hanging in the
parking lot. Leaning against a tricked-out Toyota truck.
MUSIC's coming from inside the truck. Hardy's bending the
radio antenna over. With his free hand, he's holding the
owner of the car away. His intention isn't to do damage,
only to harass his friend. The game is interrupted as
something catches Hardy's eye.

HIS POV
Drummer Girl and Keith heading into school.
HARDY AND HIS FRIENDS

Hardy lets the antenna go. He points out Keith and Drummer
Girl. Big derisive smiles.

EXT. PARKING LOT

Drummer Girl and Keith head across the lot to the school.
They're unaware that they're being observed. She's fiddl-
ing with her drumsticks as she walks.

KEITH
You don't have any books?

DRUMMER GIRL
Not on me.

KEITH
You never study, do you?

DRUMMER GIRL
Not school stuff. My urge is to
make music. Tell me how reading
"Lord Of The Flies' '1l make me
a better drummer.

KEITH
You have no desire to get out of
this place?

DRUMMER GIRL
You're talking to someone who was
raised on cocktail onions and
cigarette butts.

CONTINUED:

DRUMMER GIRL (CONT'D)
I'd like nothing better. I have
two feet. I'll get out. I'm not
worried. You must be getting
heat from the old man about
college again.

KEITH
It's all he thinks about.

DRUMMER GIRL
In comparative terms, it's
probably better to have an old
man nagging you about the future
than to have no old man not
nagging you about anything.

KEITH
Things not too great at home?

DRUMMER GIRL
The same.

The reach for the school doors. There's a crowd. Drummer
Girl taps out a little riff on the back pack of a kid
standing in front of her.

DRUMMER GIRL
It doesn't matter. As long as
you stand by me, I'm covered.

KEITH
Where would I be without you?

DRUMMER GIRL
Seeing as how I drive you to
school every day, you'd probably
be sitting on your front porch.

The kid Drummer Girl is tapping on turns around. He's an
angry little freshman dead head. His name is Ray.

RAY
Do you mind?

DRUMMER GIRL
Very much so.

Drummer Girl twirls her stick and gives the kid a pop on
the top of his head. She steps in front of him and opens
the door for Keith.

INT. SCHOOL - HALLWAY

Keith and Drummer Girl continue down a crowded hallway.
It's a corridor claimed by the headbangers. The angry
flotsam of the school loiters on the window ledges, lis-
tening to MUSIC, laying comatose, talking loudly, verbally
abusing anyone and everyone that passes. Including Keith.
His dark clothes, blank expression and boots make him ap-
pear at home in the corridor. But he's not immune to at-
tack.

VOICE
Hey! Paint my picture!

DRUMMER GIRL
(to Keith)
Some day when your shit's hanging
in a museum and these guys are
OD'd you'll be laughing.

KEITH
I'm laughing now.

DRUMMER GIRL
I think it's hip that you paint.
I think it's hip that I drum.

And it's perfect that we're
friends.

Keith stops. Drummer Girl stops. He looks down.
HIS POV

A leg is stuck out, across his path. We MOVE UP TO a big,
ugly-looking SKINHEAD. He smiles.

CLOSEUP - KEITH
He stares at the kid. Doesn't give up anything.
INT. HALLWAY
Keith steps over the obstruction. The Skinhead pulls his
leg in as Keith raises his leg and makes him highstep over
nothing. A laugh. Keith stares at the Skinhead.
DRUMMER GIRL
That's real original. How long
you been pulling that one?
SKINHEAD
(unfazed)
How long have you been a lesbian?

Drummer Girl's face goes ashen. Keith's face tightens.

(CONTINUED)

SKINHEAD
You're carrying too much up front
to be a guy. So you must be a...

Keith grabs Skinhead by his jacket front and pulls him to
his feet. He realizes that he's grabbed more than he
anticipated. Skinhead towers over him.

INT. HALLWAY

A MALE TEACHER rudely shoves his way through the crowd.
He's assigned the security. Shirt-sleeves and tie and two-

way radio on his belt.

TEACHER
That's enough!

He grabs Keith's shoulder and pushes him aside.

TEACHER
Clear out!
Keith backs away.
TEACHER
Now!
He turns and heads down the hall. Drummer Girl points her

drumstick at Skinhead.

DRUMMER GIRL
Wimp.

She follows after Keith. The teacher turns to Skinhead.
SKINHEAD
I didn't do anything! He jumped

on me! Why don't you nail him?

The teacher flips a pack of Marlboro's out of Skinhead's
shirt pocket.

SKINHEAD
It's not my shirt.

He reaches around behind and yanks a half pint out of his
hip pocket.

SKINHEAD
That's just for show.

He reaches in the other pocket and takes out a packet of ob-
scene playing cards. The teacher looks at them.

SKINHEAD
Those were a gift.

He tries his most charming smile.

TEACHER
You just got detention, mister.

INT. LIBRARY

Keith's slumped down in a chair in the back of the library.
He's working in a sketchpad. He's got his eye on something.
Drawing.

HIS POV

The girl we saw in the opening and in the photograph, Amanda
Jones, is across the room and forward of Keith. A boy is
sitting at her table. His back is to Keith.

CLOSEUP - KEITH

He's obviously very taken with her. Watching her every
move. He feels eyes upon him. An uneasiness comes over
him. His eyes shift quickly.

HIS POV - CLOSEUP ON HARDY

Hardy's turned in his seat, looking directly at Keith.
He's not pleased.

CLOSEUP - KEITH

He's caught. He looks down to avoid the stare. A beat
and he looks up.

HIS POV

We see that Hardy was the boy with his back to Keith.
He's turned around in his seat. Amanda looks from Hardy
to Keith.

CLOSEUP - KEITH

Tries to convince himself that he's not intimidated. Looks
away. Another beat and he returns his look to Hardy.

CLOSEUP - HARDY

He's still staring at Keith. He points to Keith, holds up
a pencil, points to Amanda, points to his neck, points to
Keith, points to the pencil, turns it straight up and snaps

it in half.

INT. LIBRARY - LIBRARIAN

A crusty, older woman looks up with a scowl and lets out
a loud, shhh!

CLOSEUP - KEITH

Looks at Hardy to let him know that he doesn't scare that
easily.

CLOSEUP - AMANDA

She looks from Hardy to Keith. Wondering what Keith is
doing.

INT. HALLWAY

Keith is walking down the hallway. Drummer Girl pushes
her way through the crowd to Keith.

DRUMMER GIRL
Keith!

He stops. She's flustered and nervous.

DRUMMER GIRL
Are you sitting down?

KEITH
No. I'm standing in the hall.

DRUMMER GIRL
Right. I have some bad news.

KEITH
What?

DRUMMER GIRL
This is unconfirmed but I have
it from a reliable source.

KEITH
What?

DRUMMER GIRL
I think your father's at school.

KEITH
How do you know it's my father?

DRUMMER GIRL
You know those hats he wears?

INT. COUNSELOR'S OFFICE

Cliff has taken half an hour off work to visit Keith's
counselor, a gaunt man in his fifties, MR. GALE.

CLIFF
So there's nothing special we
need to know about filling out
the applications?

MR. GALE
Just what we've covered.

CLIFF
I don't mean to be a pain in the
butt about this, I just want to
double-check. You know kids
they wait until the last minute
on everything.

MR. GALE
You have plenty of time. Has
Keith decided on a school yet?

CLIFF
We're zeroing in on a few.

MR. GALE
He's indicated to me an interest
in a couple of art schools.

CLIFF
I don't think that's going to
happen. He comes out of an art
school, what's he qualified to
do? I'm looking for a good
business program. I think he
has a good head for business.

MR. GALE
The indications I've gotten are
that he's more creatively inclined.

CLIFF
Fine. We're looking for a business
school. He can be creative in his
spare time. How's he doing other-
wise?

MR. GALE
Fine.

MR. GALE
Very well.

Cliff picks up his hat and offers his hand to Mr. Gale.

CLIFF
Good. Thanks for the time.

MR. GALE
If you have any more questions
don't hesitate to call.

CLIFF
I appreciate it.

INT. HALLWAY

Cliff heads down an empty hallway. We MOVE AHEAD OF him
TO Skinhead. He's standing at a locker, prying it open
with a large screwdriver. He hears Cliff coming, turns
TOWARD CAMERA, shoves the screwdriver down his front and
closes his jacket. To avoid a problem, Skinhead takes
the immediate offensive position. He turns as Cliff
reaches him.

SKINHEAD
Excuse me, sir. Can I see your

hall pass?

Cliff is surprised by the request.

CLIFF
I don't have a pass. I'ma
parent. I was seeing Mr. Gale.

I'm on my way out.

SKINHEAD
Please don't think me rude, sir,
but we have to limit access to
these hallways to students and
authorized persons only. You
have no idea how many unsavory
types try to gain entry to the
school to prey on the youngsters.
They bring in contraband,
controlled substances, obscene
rock 'n roll lyrics. I'm
telling you, sir, it's like
wolves running free in the hen
house.

CLIFF
I'm heading right out.
SKINHEAD
I'm sure you are, sir. You
have an honest face and an
overall honorable body shape.
I'm just alerting you to the
rules. From a concerned teen
to a concerned parent.

CLIFF
Boy, I got two kids who I wished
had your attitude.

SKINHEAD
It's refreshing, isn't it?

CLIFF
Very. Thanks.

SKINHEAD
God bless.

Cliff smiles and continues on his way. Skinhead waits
a beat and returns to the locker.

30E INT. CLASSROOM - LAURA
She's sitting in class. All eyes turn to the door.
HER POV
He waves to Laura.
CLOSEUP - LAURA
We PUSH IN ON her face as she screams.

31 INT. SCHOOL ART ROOM
Keith's wearing paint-splattered jeans and a T-shirt.
He's sitting on the back of a chair, studying a canvas
he's working on. He's holding a paint brush in his
teeth. It's after school. Late. He hears talking in
the hallway. He looks out the door.

32 HIS POV

Hardy and a sophomore girl, MIA, are talking in the hall-
way.

He studies the situation, listens carefully.

INT. HALLWAY

Mia's back is to the lockers. Hardy's standing in front
of her, leaning forward, resting his elbow on the locker.
Engulfing her. She's completely under his spell. He's
older, he's richer, he's handsome, he's popular, he's
dangerous.

HARDY
(softens)
I want you to stay close but not
too close. You back off when I
say, okay?

She nods, yes.

HARDY
It'll get good.

Mia nods. He gives her a gentle kiss.

HARDY
Both your parents work?

Mia nods.

HARDY
Good. Maybe I'll come over
after school one day this week.

INT. HALLWAY - AMANDA
HER POV

Hardy and Mia. The tail end of the kiss. Hardy pulls
back from her. He looks down the hall and catches Amanda
looking at him. He steps back from Mia. She shoots a
look to Amanda. Hardy looks at her. She heads off down
the hall. Hardy smiles. He starts toward Amanda with his
arms outspread.

HARDY
(to himself)
Shit...
INT. HALLWAY - AMANDA
She turns to her locker and opens it. She's angry and
hurt. Hardy approaches her, acting as if he's done no-

thing wrong.

HARDY
You wanna go to your place?

CONTINUED:

Amanda glares at him, throws her books in her locker and
grabs her coat.

HARDY
What's wrong?

Amanda tries to get away. Hardy blocks her.

AMANDA
Do you mind?
HARDY
Yes I do. I want to know what's
wrong.
Amanda doesn't respond?
HARDY
Mia?
AMANDA

I'm impressed, you asked her name.

HARDY
She's a friend of my little
sister. Her brother was ina
pretty serious car accident,
and she's a little upset.

Amanda glares at him. She's never been very good holding
up her side of an argument with Hardy.

HARDY
I'm waiting for you. I know
you're coming, why would I be
trying to make another girl?
It makes no sense at all.

Amanda backs down a bit. He's charming logic leaves her
without an immediate counter.

HARDY
How can you be so beautiful and

so insecure at the same time?

In lieu of something to say, she holds her look on him.

HARDY
Trust is the basis of any
relationship. I trust you.

He leans forward and kisses her forehead.

He points to a ring on his baby finger. He points to her.
He slips it off, takes her hand, slips the ring on her
finger and kisses her again. She doesn't say yes. She
doesn't say no. Hardy takes the answer as yes.

HARDY
I'll get the car and meet you
in front.
He heads down the hall. In the direction Mia went. Amanda
looks at the floor and sighs angrily. She's upset with
herself. She wants to bust him but can't. She senses that

she's being watched. She turns.

HER POV

Keith's standing in an open doorway looking at her.

She feels uncomfortable. Wonders if he overheard the con-
versation. She'd rather keep her acquiescence to Hardy a
secret.

CLOSEUP - KEITH

He's heard it all. He's worried for her. He knows what

a stroke job she got. He gives her a two finger salute
and a smile.

CLOSEUP - AMANDA

It's too close. She exits.

CLOSEUP - KEITH

He watches the empty doorway for a long beat. He picks up
his brush, dips it in a jar of turpentine and cleans it on
his work shirt.

INT. ART ROOM

Keith's done for the day. He lays the brush down, peels
off the shirt and looks at the canvas.

CLOSEUP - CANVAS

An under-painting. Sketchy, incomplete, but very good.

EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT

A clean, modern local service station. In the good part
of town. The lights are on in the repair bays and the
office.

INT. GAS STATION
Keith's in the repair bay working on a Jaguar. Drummer

Girl's sitting on a work bench, tapping her sticks on
various surfaces.

KEITH
Jesus Christ!
Drummer Girl looks up.
KEITH
Two flies are having sex. It's
amazing.
DRUMMER GIRL
It happens.

Keith goes back to work.
DRUMMER GIRL
How's it feel to stand under an
old Jaguar?
KEITH
About the same as standing under
an old Ford. Dirty and hot.
DRUMMER GIRL

As she drums her way around the work bench, she hits Keith's
sketch book. She throws him a look back and opens the book.

KEITH (0.C.)
You wanna stand under it?

CLOSEUP - BOOK

She leafs through the book and the sketches of Amanda. She
finds the tattered photo.

CLOSEUP - DRUMMER GIRL

She looks at Keith.

DRUMMER GIRL
You have any money?

KEITH
Yeah.

DRUMMER GIRL
If I get hungrier, I'll call.

KEITH
Don't you ever eat at home?

DRUMMER GIRL
I don't like to eat alone.

KEITH
Where's your mom?

DRUMMER GIRL
Which way's the wind blowing?

Drummer Girl leans back as she abruptly changes the subject.
DRUMMER GIRL

If you wanted to, you could blow
every guy in this feeble town out

of the water. From a female,
popularity, sexual relationship
standpoint.

Keith looks at her. He doesn't understand what she means.

KEITH
I'm not interested in blowing
anybody out of the water.

DRUMMER GIRL
Yeah?

KEITH
Yeah.

DRUMMER GIRL
So what's the deal with Amanda
Jones?

Keith pauses in his work. She's hit something. He con-
tinues.

DRUMMER GIRL
(looks down)

I know you're thinking about her.

KEITH
Wrong.

DRUMMER GIRL
We've been friends too long to
bullshit each other. I know
when something's going on inside
you. And I know Amanda Jones is
on your mind.

(looks up)

You've always been on your own.
I like you because you don't
follow everybody. You're not
sheep. You don't sell your soul
to belong. And it's scary to me
that you might change that.

KEITH
Nothing's changing.

DRUMMER GIRL
Look me in the eye and tell me
you don't think about Amanda
Jones.

Keith turns to her.

KEITH
So what if I do? What do you
care?

DRUMMER GIRL
Oh, come on. You're better than
her. She's a major part of
everything you don't believe in.

KEITH
She's not that much different.

DRUMMER GIRL
Yeah? Who's been lying to you?
She's worse than different. She
crossed town to belong to the
lowest of the low. If that's
the kind of person who inspires
you, you've got a morality problem.

KEITH
You sound a little jealous.

Exactly. Drummer Girl is stunned that he nailed her feel-
ings and is obliged to deny.

Of what? Her? Yeah, right.

KEITH
You're afraid that, if I went
out with Amanda, we couldn't
be friends.

DRUMMER GIRL
That would be entirely my choice
and I'm not worried about it
because, regardless of what I
say, you're too internal to
open up and ask her out, so why
don't we change the subject?

A BELL RINGS in the station. Keith flips his wrench into
the tool box.

KEITH
You brought it up.

DRUMMER GIRL
Yeah. And I brought it up because
I care about you. She doesn't.
She has one thing on her mind and
you don't make enough of it to
matter to her. I rest my case.

Keith wipes his hands on his jeans and exits the station.

DRUMMER GIRL
Speak of the she-devil.

EXT. STATION

The black Corvette's parked at the pumps. Hardy and
Amanda. Keith walks out of the repair bay.

CLOSEUP - KEITH
He slows as he recognizes Amanda.
CLOSEUP - HARDY AND AMANDA

Hardy sees Keith. Amanda looks around at him. Hardy
BLOWS the HORN and holds it several long beats.

CLOSEUP - KEITH
He isn't amused. A hard, cold look passes over his face.

He walks around the front of the Corvette.

HARDY
Twenty dollars, super unleaded.
(pause, smile)
Check the oil.

Hardy reaches under the dash and pops the hood. Keith
steps back to the pump and removes the hose. He uncaps
the tank and shoves the hose nozzle in.

HARDY
Be nice, or I'll make you check
the tires.

Keith sighs with disgust. He looks at Amanda. She avoids
him.

HARDY
So, this is what you do for a
living, huh?

Keith looks at him. Says nothing. He walks to the front
of the car. He opens the hood.

KEITH
You want to cut the engine?

HARDY
My pleasure.

He turns off the engine. Keith leans into the engine ca-
vity and looks for the dipstick. He finds it and yanks
it out. The HORN BLOWS.
HARDY (0.C.)

Sorry about that. My hand

slipped.
Keith shakes his head at the cheap trick.

Amanda isn't amused by Hardy's cruelty.

AMANDA

Keith's watching the pump meter.

HARDY
You like looking at my girlfriend,
huh?

Keith glares at him. Amanda gives Hardy ice.

HARDY
(to Amanda)
What? He likes looking at you.

AMANDA
Shut-up, Hardy.

Keith removes the nozzle from the tank. Amanda shoots a

look at him. He puts the hose back and looks at Amanda.

A serious look. A look that preserves what's left of his
dignity.

HARDY
I'd recommend you keep your eyes
and your mind off my property.

He starts the engine. Keith smiles. He's not frightened.
Hardy holds a twenty dollar bill between his index and
middle finger.

HARDY
Here's ten for the gas, ten for
the look.

Keith looks at the bill. Pulls it out of Hardy's hand.
Keith smiles. Hardy slams the car in gear and screams out
of the station. Keith watches him go. He folds the twenty
and puts it in his shirt pocket. He reaches behind his
back and pulls Hardy's dipstick out. He tosses it in the
trash barrel. He walks back to the repair bay.

It reads, $8.00. Keith's only given him ten dollars worth

Drummer Girl's seen everything. She'd like to kill Hardy.
And possibly Amanda. Keith walks in.

DRUMMER GIRL
Keith? I watched that. It was
sick. If that isn't the raw,
bleeding truth about Amanda Jones,
I don't know what is. If you
think that's interesting, you
better pack it in.

He picks up his tool and goes back to work under the Jaguar.
Drummer Girl watches him. She turns up the RADIO and sits
back on the bench.

EXT. SCHOOL - TENNIS COURTS

Girls' gym. Tennis. A BELL RINGS. An INSTRUCTOR blows a
whistle and waves the girls in.

EXT. SCHOOL - STREET

Hardy's car pulls up fast and stops. Amanda gets out.
She's wearing a gym uniform. She reaches into the car and
grabs a tennis racket. She hurries up the steps onto the
courts. Hardy pulls away. Amanda's class is heading back
to school. She hurries to join them, hoping to avoid de-
tection. She rushes into the crowd exiting the courts and
quickly adjusts to their gait.

EXT. BLEACHERS

Keith and half a dozen other downtown boys are sitting on
the bleachers. They've spent their gym period watching
girls' gym. Keith sits up as he sees Amanda join her class.

to Amanda.

INSTRUCTOR
Amanda Jones?

Amanda slows and stops. She knows she's caught. She
curses under her breath.

Amanda turns angrily and heads for the school.

INT. SCHOOL DOORWAY - KEITH

Keith's standing in the doorway. A puzzled, worried look
on his face. He scans the room.

HIS POV - INSIDE DETENTION ROOM

It's filled with the meanest, most wasted citizens of the
school. Motor-psycho maniacs. They look to the door.

He's stunned. Not a female face in the room. No Amanda
Jones.

INT. HALLWAY
Amanda's talking with a male TEACHER. He's a middle-aged

goof with a massive Brylcreme wave. He's clearly appreci-
ative of Amanda's charms.

AMANDA
It's really sweet of you to not
make me sit in there. It's all

guys. I'd feel very weird.

TEACHER
I suppose it wouldn't matter if
you served your detention in my
office.

AMANDA
Actually, I have a better idea.
What if I didn't serve detention
at all? What if I swear I'll
never do what I did again?

The teacher is unable to resist. He sighs.

TEACHER
We'll keep this just between you
and me.

AMANDA

(sweet and phoney)
You're incredibly nice. And I
love the way you wear your hair.

TEACHER
Really?
Amanda nods. The Teacher gives her a big, goofy smile.
He's fallen like a bag of Portland cement. She exits. He

turns and examines his hair in the reflective surface of a
chrome fire extinguisher.

INT. DETENTION ROOM

Keith's sitting with the beasts. The Skinhead Keith con-
fronted earlier is sitting next to him.

SKINHEAD
Serves you right, shithead.

KEITH
Thanks.

They look at each other. It's a tense stand-off. A long
exchange of looks that could go either way.

EXT. DRUMMER GIRL'S HOUSE - AFTERNOON

A small, dreary bungalow badly in need of paint, care and

repair. Sandwiched in between freeway and refinery. Keith
and Drummer Girl are sitting on the porch. Semi-conscious
hound is sprawled on the sidewalk below the porch. Drummer

Girl's fiddling with her drumsticks.

DRUMMER GIRL
If you don't figure your shit
out pretty soon, it's gonna get
too embarrassing to be your
friend. What kind of moron
gives himself two weeks of
detention?

 

Keith looks away. He's embarrassed enough.

DRUMMER GIRL
You familiar with the Road Runner
cartoons? Beep! Beep!

KEITH
I really don't need the insults.

DRUMMER GIRL
You're going to hell in a hand-
basket. Amanda Jones doesn't
know you, doesn't care about you.
You're trying to jerk off the
impossible. How many times do
I have to listen to myself tell
you this?

Keith holds a stare on her.

KEITH
You know what kind of a guy Hardy
is?

DRUMMER GIRL
Handsome, rich, popular, muscular
hot, happening and capable of
reducing your head to a crimson
stain on the wall.

KEITH
(bitter chuckle)
You really know how to ferret-out
the dark and ugly, don't you?

have to eat it.

KEITH
(stubborn, unmoved)
Hardy's a jerk. He screws around,
he treats her like shit...

DRUMMER GIRL
And obviously she gets off on
it. You're losing it; and when
it's lost, all you are is a loser.

KEITH
You have no idea how I feel, so
why don't you just butt-out of
it?

DRUMMER GIRL
I know how you feel.

KEITH
Yeah? Really? You've been in
love.

DRUMMER GIRL
There's lots of things you don't
know about me.

KEITH

Who've you ever been in love

Drummer Girl turns defensive. She's exposed too many

DRUMMER GIRL
You want to abuse yourself, be

Keith's across the street watching Amanda.
AMANDA

As she plays with the baby, she notices something. She
looks up.

Keith watches a moment and continues home.

INT. DETENTION ROOM - MORNING

Keith's in detention with the junior criminals. He's
working in his sketchbook. Skinhead's next to him,
scratching on the desk top with a pocket knife. The

Drummer Girl has just come from her shower. She's wear-

catches her eye.

HER POV

Amanda Jones. Bra and panties, combing her hair. Perfect
light, perfect pose. She looks like she's in a French Lin-
gerie commercial.

CLOSEUP - DRUMMER GIRL
She looks Amanda up and down. She looks at her own body.

The bust inside a white T-shirt, the curve of her boyish
hips, her round, little belly. She makes, to her mind, a

disheartening comparison. It's a girl's body standing up
to a woman's. She looks back to Amanda.

are strewn about the floor and bench. She looks at Drummer
Girl.

GIRL

Are those boy's underpants?

Amanda turns and looks at Drummer Girl. She smiles as she
sees the boy's underpants.

DRUMMER GIRL
Yeah. So?

She picks up a drumstick off the bench. Amanda exits.

GIRL
So, I never saw a girl wear boy's
underpants.

Drummer Girl twirls her stick like a baton.

DRUMMER GIRL
You ever see a girl with a
drumstick shoved up her nose?

Long pause.

GIRL
Is that some kind of threat?

DRUMMER GIRL
No, that's some kind of warning.

The Girl clicks her tongue and heads to the showers, leav-
ing Drummer Girl to herself. She tucks her T-shirt into
the boxers. She turns around and looks at herself in the
mirror at the end of the aisle. She strikes a feminine
pose. It doesn't work for her.

Big, wide and confusing. Friday on the boulevard. An end-

party. Not unlike Westwood on a Saturday night in summer or
Palm Springs at Easter break. MUSIC is blowing from windows
and the backs of trucks. Clothes show on the sidewalks, mat-

Keith's sitting on the back of a bus bench. He's serious

for. Amanda Jones. I've been
contemplating the matter and I've
come to a conclusion. You
interested?

operational. You are my closest
personal friend, and if this jive
with Amanda Jones has anything to
do with sex...

(nervous pause,

looks away)
».. we could, maybe... you know,
maybe we could... work something
out, maybe.

Keith is flabbergasted at Drummer Girl's intimate proposal.
While the suggestion is bizarre, it's also sincere and ob-
viously an enormous gesture. Keith is strangely touched
and deeply appreciates it.

KEITH
It's not supposed to be like
that. I appreciate the offer
but it's not right. This isn't
about sex, Watts.

DRUMMER GIRL
(shrugs off the
decline)

He pushes the guy aside and gets in his car. He fires up
the engine.

INT. KEITH'S DINING ROOM - MORNING

It's Sunday morning. Big breakfast. Cliff's staring sus-
piciously. Chewing very slowly.

CAROL

She's sneaking curious glances between bites.
LAURA

She's staring. Very confused.

CINDY

Same thing.

KEITH

He's eating and smiling. Big smile. He notices the family
studying him. Stops.

KEITH
What?

CLIFF
He squints. He doesn't understand.

CLIFF
Why're you smiling?

She smiles.

CLIFF

He looks at Carol then back to Keith.

CLIFF
Did you do something to the car?

KEITH
He looks at Cliff.
KEITH
I wasn't aware that I was smiling.
If it bothers you, I won't do it.
CLIFF
He's not entirely convinced.
CLIFF
You haven't smiled in a while.
I was just curious about the
change.
KEITH
Stares at him.
KEITH
I haven't had much to smile
about, Clifford.
He looks at Carol.
CAROL

She forces a smile.

CAROL
You have a nice smile.

KEITH
Holds the smile.

KEITH
Thanks, Carol.

INT. DINING ROOM

Laura's held her tongue. She's been staring at Keith the
whole time. Studying the change in him. Finally she speaks.

LAURA
This isn't true. It can't be.
It has to be like the most
hilarious rumor ever floated,
right?

Keith doesn't respond. He just smiles.

CAROL
What're you talking about?

LAURA
Okay, I'm in town last night and
I hear everybody saying that
Keith asked a girl out.

CINDY
No way!

LAURA

Check it out. She's scandalously
popular, insanely beautiful and
obviously in the middle of some
emotional shoot-out to consent
to date the human Tater Tot.

(to Keith)
What'd you do to her? Threaten
her life?

KEITH
I just asked her out.

LAURA
Her boyfriend's a man, for
Christ's sake. He's extensively
easy on the eyes, he's a total
buck and you're... you're Keith.

CAROL
Is she nice, Keith?

LAURA
Mother, the girl is sex.

CINDY
For God's sake, I'm eating!

CLIFF
I'm glad you can find the time
to think about girls.

CLIFF
Between the girls and your art

anything important. I'll be
dead and buried before you get
off your butt and apply to a

Ease up, Dad. Any fool can get

few can say the same thing about
Amanda Jones.

Cliff and Keith stare at Laura.

LAURA
Am I wrong?

The beasts are all armed with sketch pads and sticks of

SKINHEAD
This was an outstanding idea.
Most of these goons have little

Keith gives him a smile.

Keith smiles. Partly out of pride, partly out of his des-—

KEITH
You know about Amanda Jones?

SKINHEAD
What? You think I live in here?
I got a personal life. How'd
you swing that one? She's
dangerous.

KEITH
I don't know, Duncan, I asked
her out, and she just said,
"yes."

SKINHEAD
What do you suppose she sees in
you? No offense, of course.

KEITH
I guess I'll find out sooner or
later.

SKINHEAD

Any time somebody on the outside
lifts a woman off a guat like
Jenns, we can all find cause to
rejoice. I'm proud of you.

85 EXT. SCHOOL - COURTYARD
Drummer Girl's sitting with a rough, little headbanger, RAY.
He clearly likes her. He looks like Drummer Girl may be his
fashion leader. They're sitting on wall.
RAY
You want me to kiss you or feel
you up or anything?

Drummer Girl stares at him.

DRUMMER GIRL
You want to die young?

RAY
What kind of question is that?

DRUMMER GIRL
Just sit next to me and shut up.

Drummer Girl looks down the hall. Ray shrugs. He buys
it. For a moment.

Drummer Girl is about to scream from his annoying questions.

RAY
Because you radiate a sexual
vibe. If you wanted to, you

could be a girl...
(snaps his fin-
gers)

Like that.

DRUMMER GIRL
This is 1987. A girl can be
whatever she wants to be.

RAY
I know. My mother's a plumber.

Do you know Raymond?

KEITH
No.

He holds out his hand. Ray looks at Drummer Girl. Drummer
Girl glares at him. He shakes Keith's hand.

RAY
A pleasure.

KEITH
Yeah.
(to Drummer Girl)
Are you busy?

DRUMMER GIRL
Just sitting here with Raymond.
Why?

KEITH
I need to borrow your car. If
you had something to do, I'd
swing back around in a while
and pick you up.

DRUMMER GIRL

DRUMMER GIRL
I'd appreciate a couple bucks

Keith is surprised by the remark. He doesn't mind paying
his way, it's the manner in which she asked. He nods.

KEITH
About an hour?

DRUMMER GIRL
Fine. It's just time. Not like
it means anything.

Keith nods. He's confused by her attitude. He backs away.
Drummer Girl slides away from Ray.

RAY
You gotta wait around an hour?

Drummer girl nods.
RAY
Do you know how much damage we

could do to each other in an
hour?

He raises an eyebrow. Drummer Girl gets up an leaves him
behind. He crosses his legs and smiles.

Keith's sitting outside. Waiting. Amanda and Shayne exit
the school. Keith stands up as she passes.

KEITH
Amanda?

Amanda and Shayne stop.

I thought maybe we could talk.

AMANDA
Well, I was...

Why don't you call me?

KEITH
Yeah. Okay.

Amanda feels terribly sorry for him. He's melting in the
presence of the two girls. Shayne intercedes.

SHAYNE
(to Amanda)
Why don't you go with him?

Amanda looks daggers at her. Keith waits for the final an-
swer. He studies Shayne's involvement. Amanda looks at
Keith and smiles with dread.

AMANDA
Where're you parked?

Keith smiles with relief.

KEITH
I'll pull around.

He heads away. Amanda turns on Shayne.

AMANDA
Thanks a lot!

SHAYNE
Oh, really? You used him to
get away from Hardy.

AMANDA
It wasn't deliberate. It just
happened. I was mad and he
stepped in. It was just bad
circumstances.

SHAYNE

Regardless, the longer you wait
to kill it, the worse it's gonna
be. He's completely deluded.
Unless of course, you're

Amanda shoves Shayne. She laughs.

Shayne urges her with a stern look.

back-walks until it's too stupid to continue. He turns,
shoves his hands in his back pockets and saunters up to
his house.

INT. CAR - SHAYNE AND AMANDA

Shayne is angry with Amanda. Amanda turns her look from
Keith to the footwell.

SHAYNE
That was swift. I gave you the
perfect window to throw him out
of, and you went limp.

AMANDA
(defensive)
Maybe you can do that sort of
thing. I can't. Not in cold
blood, anyway.

SHAYNE
Then I guess you got a new
boyfriend.

Amanda looks at her angrily.

SHAYNE
He's too dim to catch a hint.
If you don't tell him, he won't

She laughs, fake and phoney.

LAURA

And he told you we live here?
He is so modest.

I suppose he didn't say a word

No. Are you?

I didn't come here to talk about art.

Keith doesn't reply. Hardy smiles. Eases up.

me a favor.

Keith waits cautiously.

HARDY
I don't know where you guys are
going Saturday, but if you could
swing it, I'd like you to come
by my place. I'm having some
friends over. The parents are
in Europe.

KEITH
You're inviting me to your house?

 

HARDY
Yeah. I've invited a lot of
people. Something wrong?
KEITH

I don't know. You tell me.

HARDY

Nothing wrong on my end. You
got an inferiority complex or
something?

(pause)
I don't know you all that well;
I may not even like you if I get
to know you. That's not the
issue. I've known Amanda a long
time; I want to stay friends.
And if it's too much to bring
her over, forget it. I'm sorry
I asked.

one.

KEITH
That's why I'm a little cautious
about your motives.

HARDY
I'll buy that. You want the
plain truth?

Keith shrugs. He's not so sure he'd recognize it.

HARDY
I have a lot of pride. And it's
been damaged, and I don't like
it. I can recover it, in my own
mind at least, by showing people
whose opinions matter to me that
you and I are friends. Then it's
not like you stole Amanda from
me. Bad blood makes me look like
a fool. If we're friends, it's
okay. I've traded off lots of
girls to friends. That's
acceptable. It's not acceptable
some stranger lifting Amanda off
me.

KEITH
The logic's a little perverse.

HARDY
Probably, but that's what it is.
You tell anybody I had this
conversation with you and I'll
kick the shit out of you. That's
a promise.

He slides off the table and grabs his gym bag. He heads

Am I too weird to be around now
that you're moving up?

Keith doesn't particularly care for the tone.

Yeah. Something you never had
to do in two years before? It's

AMANDA
From who's point of view?

SHAYNE
Yours. You aren't a natural
fit in all this. They don't
have to let you belong. You
could be on the other side of
the world for all anybody really

cares. You like being a part
of something. Don't kid your-

you lose everything.

I'd never say it to your face,
but I don't know what I'll feel
like if I'm frozen out. You
won't, either. Why risk it for

I wish it was.

KEITH
It's not.

DRUMMER GIRL
I'm not upset about her. I'm
upset about you. She's the same.
You're the one who's changed.

KEITH
What's wrong with change?

DRUMMER GIRL
I liked you better when you were
a nothing.

KEITH
I wish you'd take a few minutes
out of your day to sit down and
think about what all this means
to me.

DRUMMER GIRL
What about what it all means to me?

KEITH
It means, you don't have a love-
sick, depressed, boring friend
anymore.

DRUMMER GIRL
She doesn't love you. It's a
joke. It's all a joke.

Keith scoffs at the remark.

KEITH
Oh, really?

DRUMMER GIRL
I'd bet my hands on it.

KEITH
You don't want to make that bet.

DRUMMER GIRL (CONT'D)
(pause)
I gotta split. This is too much
agony for me. I've been thinking

about you and me a lot lately
and I came to a conclusion that
I didn't want to deal with, but
now that we talked, I can't hide
it anymore.

(deep breath)
I think we'll get along much
better if we don't spend so much
time together anymore.

KEITH
Why?

DRUMMER GIRL
Because. I'm driving you crazy,
you're driving me crazy, and I'd
rather have you think good things
about me and not see me than see
me and hate me. I can't afford
to have you hate me, Keith. The
only things I care about in this
life are me, my drums and you.
Adios.

She walks away from the table. Keith calls to her.

KEITH
Watts!

She stops and turns. Looks at him a moment, turns and
disappears into the crowd.

CLOSEUP - KEITH

A part of himself is walking out. There's no obvious so-
lution to the problem. He's torn between love and friend-
ship, and love has to win. He turns back. He looks at
his watch. He fears that Amanda won't show. He slides
down in the chair to wait it out.

You get to go to parties?

LAURA
Of course. I'm probably going
to the one Saturday at Hardy
Jenns'. Keith's going with
Amanda. We might double.

FRIEND 2
Who'd go out with you?

LAURA
The choices are limitless.

FRIEND
Can we go, too?

LAURA
Eventually. If you stay cool.

You're lying.

Yeah.

Laura slides down off the planter.

LAURA
I was hanging with you fungi in
a vain effort to cool you out,
but all I get is breeze, so, cie

She heads down the mall. The girls watch curiously. Laura
sneaks glances back at them. She's over-estimated the si-
tuation badly.

GIRLS
They watch Laura head down the mall.

FRIEND 2
She's a liar. Her brother loathes
her. He'd never let her play with
his rep.

THEIR POV

Laura strolls down the mall. She slows as she reaches the

boys. She looks back at the girls, strikes an attitude and
flips them off. She slides up on another planter, adjacent
to the group. It looks like she's a part of the group.

LAURA

She's not really connected to the people. She's just on
the edges. She puts herself in a sexy, careless attitude.
The boys are below and to the side of her. Unaware of her.

HARDY
Amanda has to bring him. What
else can she do? She can't
take the pressure. She'll bring him.

She's devastated by what she's overheard. Stunned. All
the evil she's done on Keith comes rushing back on her.
Tears gather in her eyes. She leaps down off the planter
and takes off down the mall.

They watch as Laura charges past, breaking in and out of

Hey, Laura! Did they send you

The girls laugh.

She's serious and grieved.

LAURA
I'm sorry, Keith. I thought if

Keith sits up on the bed.

KEITH
This should be interesting.

Laura walks in and sits on the edge of his desk.

LAURA
I heard something tonight at the
mall. Hardy Jenns and his guys
were there, and I heard them
talking about you.

KEITH

LAURA
I've jumped on you pretty hard
for a pretty long time, Keith.

Keith, it's a joke. Amanda

The whole thing's a joke. She's
going out with you to get you

mess you up.

Keith freezes.
LAURA

I heard Hardy say it. I heard
him. It's true.

KEITH
A joke?
LAURA
I'm sorry, Keith. For everything.

She backs slowly out the room and closes the door. We HEAR
the CLICK of the LOCK. Laura's used her butter knife to
secure the door for Keith. MUSIC COMES UP. Keith turns

to the window.

Stares out the window. He realizes what a fool he's been.
How he's turned from his friends. How exposed he's let
himself get. He looks at a sketch of Amanda on his wall.

She's soaked with sweat. She's wearing shorts and a torn
piece of T-shirt for a bra. The room is drab and dingy.

The total value of the contents including the drums and
stereo is nine cents. It's a mess. The walls are decorated
with graffiti. The door opens, and Keith walks in. Drum-—
mer Girl looks up at him. She smiles and continues drum-
ming. Keith walks over and sits on the bed. Drummer Girl
reaches over with a drumstick, tips the tone arm on the
turntable and sends it into reject. The music ends.

KEITH
You're getting really good.

DRUMMER GIRL
(formal, stiff)
I'm working on it.

KEITH
You're brothers don't mind you
playing this late?

DRUMMER GIRL
I don't know. I never asked.
To what do I owe the honor?

KEITH
I got a little problem.

Drummer Girl senses big trouble. She gets off her seat and
lays her sticks down.

KEITH
You know how you told me that
the thing with Amanda's a joke?

DRUMMER GIRL
Yeah?

KEITH
It's a joke.

DRUMMER GIRL
You mean a joke, as in a joke on
you?

Keith nods. Drummer Girl winces. As angry as she was at
him, she understands how bad he feels.

Laura overheard Hardy talking
about it. Amanda's supposed to
get me over to Hardy's house,
and they're gonna pound me.

with her drumstick.

She doesn't like Hardy. I know
it. The guy uses her up and
down.

DRUMMER GIRL
You're playing word games. The
fact is, she sucker-punched you
and set you up to lose your face.

I'm not afraid of Hardy.

You're gonna go through with
this?

KEITH
I have to.

DRUMMER GIRL
You think it's just Hardy?

chance. I'm not gonna hide.

Drummer Girl is completely frustrated. She walks to the

Not for another minute.

Drummer Girl turns from the window. She can't argue him.

Me, too.

He touches her cheek.

She just lays still, feeling his body against hers.

Amanda hesitates. She looks at her friends. She's embar-

CLOSEUP - AMANDA AND SHAYNE

They're sifting through hanging blouses. Shayne tugs
Amanda's sleeve to get her attention. She motions her
head for Amanda to look behind her. Amanda discreetly
turns and looks.

HER POV

Drummer Girl is doing a bad job of pretending to be pre-
occupied.

CLOSEUP - AMANDA AND SHAYNE

Shayne whispers to Amanda. They leave the blouses and go
into the dressing rooms.

Drummer Girl slides over to the blouses.

They're watching from the dressing area. Shayne smiles.
She has an idea. She exits the dressing room. Amanda
follows.

Drummer Girl watches out of the corner of her eye as Amanda

Drummer Girl follows.

INT. MALL

Amanda and Shayne walk down the mall. Drummer Girl is be-
hind them. They turn into a store.

INT. MEN'S CLOTHING STORE

Amanda and Shayne walk in. Amanda doesn't get what Shayne's
doing. But she follows. A beat, and Drummer Girl slips
into the store.

INT. STORE - AMANDA AND SHAYNE

They cross to a rack of suits, and Shayne starts looking
through them. She motions to Amanda to do the same.

She's looking at a rack of belts. Keeping a watchful eye
on the ladies.

Amanda and Shayne leave the suits. Shayne leads. They
move to the back of the store. Drummer Girl leaves the
belts and looks at the suits.

CLOSEUP - DRUMMER GIRL

She's looking through the suits. She's puzzled. She looks
at the sleeve, holds it, thinks for a minute. Realizes
that something's very wrong. She looks up and turns.

HER POV

Amanda and Shayne are looking directly at her.

CLOSEUP - DRUMMER GIRL

She realizes that she's been caught. A beat and the embar-
rassment hits. She turns back to the suits and curses her-
self for letting herself get trapped.

CLOSEUP - AMANDA AND SHAYNE

Shayne looks at Amanda with a smile. Amanda isn't amused at
the prank. She exits. Shayne doesn't know what she means.
A beat and she follows.

INT. STORE - DOORWAY

Amanda stops at the door. Shayne continues out into the
mall. Amanda looks back at the suit rack.

HER POV

Drummer Girl is staring at the sleeve. She looks back at
Amanda. A hurt, angry look.

CLOSEUP - AMANDA

A look of mild compassion. But still curious. What does
the girl want?

DRUMMER GIRL
Okay.

Keith gives her a smile. He slams the hood shut and wipes
his fingerprints off the paint.

KEITH
Not an altogether terrible mode
of transportation, huh?

She has something on her mind that's hard to bring forth.

DRUMMER GIRL
One last detail hangs.

Keith tosses the rag and leans back on the car.

DRUMMER GIRL
Don't think I'm being weird, but
what if she wants you to kiss her?

Keith gives her a deadpan look.

DRUMMER GIRL
I'm serious.

KEITH
(with a smile)
Well, then I guess I'll just have
to kiss her.

DRUMMER GIRL
I didn't put in all this time

all because you're too vain to
admit you're not the king of

Keith takes a step to the bench. Another step and he's
face to face with her. He gingerly lays his hands on her
hips. She grabs his wrists and plants the hands firmly
on her tight, little hips.

DRUMMER GIRL
Look in my eyes.

Keith looks into her eyes. He laughs. Drummer Girl glares
at him.

DRUMMER GIRL
I don't have to do this, you

She hesitates for a brief moment. He opens his eyes.

Keep your eyes closed!

KEITH
Why are you staring at me?

DRUMMER GIRL
I'm seeing if you look stupid.

Drummer Girl raises a leg, plants it on Keith's belly and
fires him across the garage. She jumps down off the bench.

DRUMMER GIRL
If this is how you repay a favor
I don't know if I'm rich enough
to be your friend.
She storms out of the garage. Keith is dumbfounded.

The driver's door opens, and Drummer Girl gets out. She's
completely transformed. She's forsaken the macho image and
is coiffed and dressed in a fashion that isn't a sell-out,

her. She glances in the mirror and catches his look to her.
She turns her eyes forward, feeling as if she let out too
much emotion. She flips on the RADIO to help disguise her
exposure. Amanda slumps down in the seat and lays her head
back.

Keith's looking at Drummer Girl.
CLOSEUP - AMANDA
She looks forward. Thinking.
EXT. L.A. COUNTY MUSEUM OF ART - NIGHT
It's late. The museum is long closed. The Jaguar is parked
in front. Drummer Girl opens the door for Amanda and Keith.

They get out. Amanda looks up at the building.

AMANDA
What're we doing here?

KEITH
It's an art museum.

AMANDA
I know. But what're we doing
here?

KEITH

You don't like art?

AMANDA
Yeah, but isn't it closed?

KEITH
That doesn't mean we can't go in.

Keith leads Amanda up to the building. She doesn't get it.
Drummer Girl leans back against the car. All her hopes are
slipping away.

EXT. MUSEUM - LOADING DOCK

Amanda and Keith approach the dock. Keith gives her a hand
up. She clumsily climbs the dark steps.

INT. MUSEUM - LOADING AREA

A heavy door opens to reveal Skinhead from the detention
room.

SKINHEAD
Welcome.

CLOSEUP - AMANDA AND KEITH

Amanda looks curiously at Keith. He gives her a smile.
It's okay. He leads her in.

INT. LOADING AREA

Amanda and Keith walk in. A SECURITY GUARD is standing be-
hind Skinhead. He's a portly, middle-aged man.

SECURITY GUARD
No monkey business.

SKINHEAD
Dad? Freeze it, okay? Please?

The guard reaches for his keys. He crosses to an interior
door and unlocks it. He opens it and holds it open for Keith
and Amanda. Keith holds his hand high. Skinhead slaps it.

KEITH
Thanks.

SKINHEAD
Anything for a friend, pal.

He raises an eyebrow in Amanda's direction, indicating his
opinion of her. Keith smiles and nods. Yes, the woman is
molten. Keith puts his hand on the small of Amanda's back
and leads her into the museum. The guard closes the door.
He turns back to Skinhead.

SECURITY GUARD
I get fired for this, and you're
in the dumper, Duncan.

SKINHEAD
Absolutely.

The guard walks back over to his desk and sits down. He
opens his paper. Skinhead walks over to the desk.

SKINHEAD
Dad? I haven't said this ina
long time, and I might not say
it again, but I love your boring
old ass.

The guard looks at him. Manages a smile. Skinhead holds
out his hand. The guard looks at it. Skinhead wiggles
his fingers. The guard sighs and holds out his hand. He
wiggles his fingers and, at the same time as Skinhead,
jerks his thumb back.

CONTINUED:

SKINHEAD
Like father like son, huh?

The guard looks at Skinhead and his grim attire. A long
pause and he nods.

INT. MUSEUM

Amanda and Keith move through the dark museum. Moonlight
shines down through skylights, security lights throw oc-
casional shafts of light across the floor and walls. It's
massive, silent and forbidden.

KEITH
Have you ever been here before?

AMANDA
In grade school.

KEITH
I come all the time. But I've
never been here at night. Do
you like it?

AMANDA

It feels pretty good being
somewhere I'm not supposed to be.

KEITH
Or being with someone you're not
supposed to be with?
Amanda smiles. Keith abruptly changes the subject.
KEITH
This place is my church. I can
come here and what anybody says
about me doesn't matter.

She looks around the gallery.

The smile.

CLOSEUP - AMANDA

She's shocked, flattered, stunned. A huge smile spreads
across her face.

INT. GALLERY

Amanda sits on a stone bench. She pulls a leg up to her
chest and stares at the painting. Keith sits down next to
her. She looks at him. Looks at the painting. MUSIC COMES
UP and CARRIES ACROSS THE CUT into the next sequence.

CUT TO:
EXT. MUSEUM
The Jaguar is still parked in front.
INT. CAR

Drummer Girl's sitting in the car with her back to the door,
her legs stretched out on the seat. She's lost in a deep
sadness. She pulls up a knee, looks at her tights, looks
at her jacket. Feels foolish for the way she's dressed.
Feels foolish that she's tried to be a girl and in her mind,
failed.

CLOSEUP - DRUMMER GIRL

Her eyes are filled with tears. She's trying to hold back.
She's slowly shaking her head, no. A tear spills. She
wipes it away with the back of her hand. More tears spill.
She can't wipe them away. She bows her head and succumbs
to her feelings.

Big and empty.

EXT. HOLLYWOOD BOWL - SEATS

Drummer Girl is high up in the seats. She's laying on her
back, looking up at the sky.

AMANDA AND KEITH
They're sitting on the edge of the stage. Keith's hanging

his legs over the side. She's turned, facing him, legs
drawn up, chin on her knees.

AMANDA
What do you see in me? Be
honest.

KEITH

What do you see in me?

AMANDA
Okay. Me first?

KEITH
Yeah.
AMANDA
Okay.
She thinks for a moment.
AMANDA

I see a way out of where I am.

Keith looks at her. He thinks he understands. He's pleased
at where the conversation's going.

KEITH
Where are you?

AMANDA
I'm locked in a small, petty
world. I never had any idea
who you were other than some-
body who was different than
everybody else.

KEITH
You mean strange?

CLOSEUP -

AMANDA
Yeah. Sort of.

KEITH
And now?

AMANDA

I don't think anybody ever
thought anything of me other
than I look good next to them.
And I went because I'd rather

be next to someone for the wrong
reasons than be alone for the
right reasons.

KEITH
(unequivocally)
I'd rather be right.

AMANDA
You can stand being alone.

KEITH
Nobody can stand being alone.
If you stop thinking there's
somebody for you somewhere, it's
over. Isn't it?

DRUMMER GIRL

She sits up and looks down at Amanda and Keith on the stage.

EXT. STAGE - AMANDA AND KEITH

He turns to face her.

KEITH
I've been waiting a long time.
And I still don't have it. But
I will.

AMANDA
I don't know what you mean.

KEITH
Yeah, you do.
AMANDA
I don't. I swear.
KEITH
This was all a joke. I was

You think I used you?

KEITH
Didn't you?

Amanda holds a long look on him. There's no way out.

AMANDA
In a way.

KEITH
There's only one way to use
someone, Amanda. You do, or
you don't.

Keith's noble stance snaps Amanda. She turns on him. The
anger she's been holding in pours out.

AMANDA
And you didn't use me? You
hypocrite! What's hanging in
the museum? My soul? It's my
face! I look just as good next
to you as I do next to Hardy or
any other guy, right? Are you
in love with me?

KEITH
I think I might be.

AMANDA
You're not. This isn't love
and affection. This is revenge.
You're using me to pay back every
guy with more money and more
friends and more power than you.
Paint it any color you want, it's
you using me.

There's a long pause as Keith sees the truth behind her
attack.

KEITH

You're right. I did use you.

I used you. For all those

reasons.

Amanda appreciates his honesty. It deserves reconciliation.

AMANDA

And I used you. It's true.

It wasn't deliberate. It just

I'd thought about it, I never
would have done it. All I was
thinking about was getting away
from Hardy.

KEITH
And I used you to stand up for
myself.

AMANDA

Maybe we should call it even.

KEITH
Maybe.

Keith reaches into his pocket and takes out a jewelry box.

KEITH
This is for you.

AMANDA
What is it?
KEITH
My future. In this box is my
future.
Amanda looks at the box.
KEITH
And I'm giving it to you. Every
dime I have to my name. It's

yours.

He hands her the box. She takes it with hesitation. She
opens it. The contents startle her.

Two diamond studs.

No.

You deserve them. I'm giving
them to you. I know you like

them. I saw you wearing
Shayne's, remember?

Amanda nods.

AMANDA
It's insane. This makes no
sense, Keith.

KEITH
They're yours. For good. You
don't have to borrow from any-
body anymore. You're too good
to do that again.

AMANDA
I never heard of anybody doing
anything like this.

KEITH
I'm sure it happens every day.
Not to everybody, but to the
ones who believe in themselves.

She bows her head. The tears start. She can't help her-
self. Every negative thought she's had about herself sur-
faces. Keith's purity, the scope of his sacrifice over-
whelms her.

KEITH
Why are you crying?

AMANDA
I feel so terrible for what I
did. I hated the pressure, I
hated feeling ashamed.

So, you won't do it again. You

Amanda leans forward and kisses Keith. She puts her arms
around his neck and pulls him to her.

Keith and Amanda reach the car. Drummer Girl swings her
legs over the side.

Now what?

Hardy's house.

Amanda's alarmed. Guilt and fear. She looks at Drummer

He's in the living room. Sitting on a couch with his arm
around Mia. He's not having a great time. He's on the

waist. He kisses her forehead.

She knows the display with the girl is only an attempt to
humiliate her. She tries to let no emotion show.

Steven! What're you doing?

Keith steps forward as the room empties. The last strag-
glers exit. It's just Keith, Amanda and Hardy. Hardy's
frightened.

HARDY
You want to forget about this?
At this point, there's no reason
for us to get into it. I'm
perfectly willing to drop it.

Keith smiles. Hardy's shown his true colors. That's enough.

You want the truth. The plain
truth? You're over.

Keith raises a hand in farewell. Amanda looks at him. Her

removes the other. Keith turns to see her removing the
second one. She takes his hand and places the studs in
his palm. She curls his fingers closed around them.
