1 EXT. BERKSHIRE WOODS - NIGHT 1
A OLD VOLVO driving along a small, winding road...

NATHAN'S VOICE OVER
This is the story of the tricky
life and bitter downfall of
Coleman Silk.

ANOTHER ANGLE ON THE VOLVO as THE CREDITS BEGIN. We watch the
car wending its moonlit way. The radio in the car is playing
Rogers and Hart.

2 INT. VOLVO - CONTINUOUS 2
The DRIVER, an attractive MAN in his mid-sixties. Leaning
serenely against him, eyes closed, a handsome WOMAN, mid
thirties...

As THE CREDITS CONTINUE we occasionally CUT TO A SHOT OF A
BEAT UP RED PICK UP TRUCK sitting ominously in the shadows at
the side of the road. As THE CREDITS END we CUT TO:

CLOSE ON THE WINDSHIELD OF THE PICK UP TRUCK--inside we see
a shadowy figure.

HIS POV (TELEPHOTO SHOT): (looking through the windshield) in
the distance the Volvo rounds a curve in our direction.

3 EXT. THE PARKED RED PICK-UP TRUCK - CONTINUOUS 3
As the HEADLIGHTS wink on, the pick-up roars to life and
squeals onto the road, heading in the opposite direction as
the Volvo.

SEVERAL ANGLES--We see the Volvo and the pick-up heading
towards each other on the curving road.

When the vehicles are near enough to see each other's lights,
the pick-up abruptly swerves into the oncoming lane...

4 INT. VOLVO - CONTINUOUS 4

The couple suddenly BLINDED by the glare of headlights! The
woman wakes up, startled, squints -

DRIVER
Jesus - !

He pulls the wheel over hard! SOUND OF SQUEALING BRAKES -!
5 EXT. BERKSHIRE ROAD - NIGHT 5
The Volvo barely avoids the oncoming pick-up, but careens off

the road, plunging wildly down a steep embankment,
ricochetting off TREES and flipping into a small RIVER...
5S CONTINUED: 5

CLOSER: NO MOVEMENT FROM WITHIN, there is a terrible
silence. Suddenly we hear the scream of a bird and CUT TO:

6 EXT. ATHENA COLLEGE - DAY 6

TIGHT ON A LARGE CROW as it flaps it wings and flies away,
screeching as it disappears into the sky. We see, in the
distance, the tall steeple of a beautiful, white church, set
against the Berkshires in the distance. It is an idyllic
setting, over this we HEAR:

A MAN'S VOICE
Hey, if Clinton had fucked her in
the ass, none of this would have
happened.

THE CAMERA MOVES ACROSS to reveal A TRIO OF TENNIS PLAYERS
{ALL MIDDLE-AGED MEN) - walking after a game, carrying their
rackets, swigging bottled water and laughing. In the
background we see a picturesque, small New England campus;
old, red-brick, ivy covered, white-columned buildings,
bisecting footpaths and huge, spreading trees, benches...

1ST TENNIS PLAYER
(the original voice)
That would've kept her quiet.
Besides, in Arkansas, you're
expected to be an ass man. That's
tradition.

2ND TENNIS PLAYER
Wait a minute, she was overwhelmed
by Starr's team in that hotel
room. 11 guys hitting on her?
That was a gang bang...

3RD TENNIS PLAYER
Come on, she was talking to Linda
Tripp, talking to everybody. She's
part of that dopey culture. Yap,
yap, yap-~

1ST TENNIS PLAYER
Look, if Clinton couldn't figure
Monica Lewinsky, then the guy
shouldn't be president; that's
grounds for impeachment by itself.

Laughter. By now the three men have passed THE CAMERA and are
heading away from us.

2ND TENNIS PLAYER
I keep telling you guys, in the
ass is how you create loyalty.
6 CONTINUED: 6

3RD TENNIS PLAYER
Know what Kennedy would have told
her? Nixon? They would have told
her that not only would they not
give her a job, nobody would ever
give her a job again as long as
she lived. That her father would
be out of work. And her mother and
her brother. That no one in her
family would earn another dime if
she dared to open her mouth.

2ND TENNIS PLAYER
Yeah, he played it like a lawyer.
That's why he didn't want to come.

1ST TENNIS PLAYER

Hey, when he came, he was
finished. Evidence. The smoking
come.

(laughter)
If he'd fucked her in the ass, the
nation would have been spared this
terrible trauma.

As the men continue walking away from THE CAMERA, laughing
and talking, we HEAR:

NATHAN'S VOICE OVER
1998 was the summer of sanctimony.
America was on a piety binge.
Propriety was king. After the
fall of Communism and before the
horrors of terrorism, there was a
brief interlude when the nation
was preoccupied by cocksucking.

Just then the tennis players intersect an attractive man in
his mid-sixties; his name is COLEMAN SILK and he is the same
man we saw earlier in the car crash. He wears a well cut,
harris tweed jacket, grey flannels and carries a worn, but
expensive briefcase.

NATHAN'S VOICE OVER
(continuing)
What Nathaniel Hawthorne called
"the persecuting spirit" was
abroad in the land... And Bill
Clinton was not its only target.

THE CAMERA FOLLOWS COLEMAN SILK as he walks quickly across
the campus heading toward a classroom building in the
distance.
6 CONTINUED: (2) 6

NATHAN'S VOICE OVER

(continuing)
This is Coleman Silk. Before the
car crash, of course. Once the
powerful Dean of Faculty and
professor of Classics at Athena
College in western Massachusetts,
one of the first Jews to teach in
a classics department anywhere in
America, Coleman had spent over
thirty years at Athena... He took
a pokey, Sleepy Hollow-type
college and dragged it kicking and
screaming from mediocrity to
excellence.

As he enters the imposing looking building we HOLD FOR A BEAT:

NATHAN'S VOICE OVER

(continuing)
Of course, in the process, he made
a good many enemies... and finally

"the persecuting spirit" caught up
with Coleman...

DISSOLVE TO:
7 INT. CLASSROOM - SAME : 7

ON A BEAUTIFUL PALLADIAN WINDOW--that looks out onto another
imposing church, this one in the Gothic style. Over this we
hear Coleman Silk reciting first in Greek, then in English:

COLEMAN'S VOICE
"Sing O Gods, of the wrath of
Achilles..."

THE CAMERA PANS DOWN FROM THE WINDOW TO COLEMAN SILK who
stands in front of a desk on a raised platform. He holds a
worn copy if the Iliad in one hand

COLEMAN'S VOICE

(continuing)
All of European literature springs
from a fight--a barroom brawl
really. And what was Achilles so
angry about? He and King Agamemnon
are quarreling over a woman, a
young girl and her body and the
delights of sexual rapacity...
Achilles, the most hypersensitive
killing machine in the history of
warfare. ,
7 CONTINUED: 7

COLEMAN'S VOICE (cont'd)

Achilles, who because of his rage
at not getting the girl--isolates
himself defiantly outside the very
society whose protector he is and
whose need of him is enormous.
Achilles has to give back the girl.

(a beat:)
This is how the great imaginative
literature of Europe begins and
that is why, three thousand years
later, we are going to begin there
today. Miss...

(scanning the paper

on the desk in front

of him)
Cummings, can you tell us...

Coleman looks up:

HIS POV: thirty students, silent, there is no sign of a
response.

CLOSER ON COLEMAN--frowning.

COLEMAN

(sardonic) .
Still not here. And Mr. Thomas?..

(a beat:)
We're five weeks into the semester
and I haven't laid eyes on either
of these folks. Do these people
exist or are they spooks?

FREEZE FRAME ON COLEMAN-

NATHAN'S VOICE OVER
And now they had him. After
thirty years of academic
distinction, Coleman Silk would be
brought down by the use of one
single word.

8 INT. FACULTY CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 8

ON PROFESSOR DELPHINE ROUX--forty years old, chic, french
accented. She is the chairperson of a faculty committee of
seven. We note that one of the members of the committee is a
middle aged black man (HERB KEBLE) .

PROFESSOR ROUX
Were you aware, Professor Silk,
that Tracy Cummings and William
Thomas are African Americans?
8 CONTINUED: 8

CROSS-CUT TO COLEMAN who sits across the table from them,
baffled.

COLEMAN
(with icy sarcasm)
How could I be? I've never seen
them.

PROFESSOR ROUX
But you are aware of the
connotation of the word spook.

COLEMAN
(emphatic)
Ghost. I was referring to her
ectoplasmic character.

He opens his dictionary to the marked page -

COLEMAN
(continuing)
Here's the first definition of the
word: "Spook. 1. Informal, a
ghost; specter."

ANOTHER FACULTY MEMBER
Dean Silk, let me read you the
second dictionary meaning:
(reading)
"Disparaging. A Negro."

COLEMAN

(leaning forward,

speaking

emphatically, but

with care)
I had never laid eyes on them, how
could I know they were black?
What I did know was that they were
invisible.

PROFESSOR ROUX
(awkward pause)
Nevertheless, they have lodged a
complaint... Miss Cummings was
deva-

COLEMAN
(cutting her off)
These students have not attended
a single class! "Do they exist or
are they spooks?!" Consider the
context.
8 CONTINUED: (2) 8

COLEMAN (cont'd)
The only issue is the
nonattendance of these students,
their inexcusable neglect of work
and their sheer chutzpah. To
charge me with racism is not only
false, it is spectacularly false.

Satisfied with his rebuttal, Coleman rises and leaves the
room. HOLD ON the faculty sitting in silence.

NATHAN'S VOICE OVER
However it wasn't going to be that
easy.

9 INT. IRIS SILK'S OFFICE IN COLEMAN'S HOUSE - DAY 9

IRIS
They what?

IRIS, Coleman's wife, a vital woman with a mane of crinkly,
salt and pepper, fly-away hair, always threatening to burst
the confines of bands, pins, combs and pencils she thrusts
into it. She wears an ethnic but chic print dress and lots
of "folkloric jewelry."

Her office in their home is almost as much of a rat's nest as
her hair, bespeaking her many civic and aesthetic activities-

COLEMAN
Accused me of quote, employing a
racist epithet. Unquote.

IRIS
What epithet?

COLEMAN
Spook. Fifty years ago, it was
slang for-

IRIS
(cutting him off)
I know what it was slang for.
(then: )
That's absurd. Did you remind them
that when you were Dean, you hired
the first black -

COLEMAN
(hasty irony)
African American--
9 CONTINUED: 9

IRIS
Hired the first African American
ever on the faculty. What about
Herb Keble? He's on the committee
isn't he? Herb and Edith are
friends of ours for God's sake!
Didn't Herb open his mouth?

COLEMAN
Oh, yes...
(a withering
imitation of Herb's
sonorous voice)
"I'm sorry, Coleman. I can't be
with you on this."

CLOSER ON IRIS--outraged at the injustice.

IRIS

Well, we'll fight them! We'll
organize. My God, what a
travesty - after thirty-five years
of devoted...

(interrupting herself)
We'll start a petition drive,
that's what we'll...

(racing ahead of

herself)
We'll get a lawyer. We'll
counterattack--

THE CAMERA HOLDS ON IRIS as she continues, but the voice
slows down and deepens, moving out of sync with the image--
like a record slowing down after the power has been shut off.

IRIS
(continuing)
I've got friends among the-

QUICK CUT OF COLEMAN--as he realizes something is horribly
wrong.

COLEMAN
(a cry)
Iris!

VERY TIGHT ON IRIS--as she looks toward her husband, a look
of utter terror on her face. She knows she is about to die.

We slowly FADE TO BLACK:
NATHAN'S VOICE OVER

No, it certainly wasn't going to
be that easy.
10 INT. NATHAN ZUCKERMAN'S CABIN, BERKSHIRES - DAY 10

CLOSE ON A DESK cluttered with yellow legal pads, pencils, a
computer. In the distance we hear the sound of a television
set.

NATHAN'S VOICE OVER
Four hours later, Iris Silk died
in Coleman's arms. It was after
that that Coleman came into my
life.

THE CAMERA BEGINS TO PAN PAST a cup filled with old coffee,
half a sandwich, stacks of books, etc., etc. The impression:
chaos which hasn't been touched to REVEAL NATHAN ZUCKERMAN,
(early 40's), staring at the TV; his is the voice we have
been hearing. Light flickers on his expressionless face.
Then, from 0.S. We hear the sound of someone banging on a
door. Nathan Zuckerman pays no attention. We HEAR applause
from the TV. The banging on the door becomes more insistent.
Nathan reluctantly gets to his feet-

NATHAN
(yelling)
I'm coming...I'm coming...

ON THE DOOR, he opens it cautiously.

NATHAN'S POV: Coleman Silk, wearing chinos and a sweater.
What we notice immediately is that there is a ferocious
intensity about the man; a fire of what just might be madness
in his eyes.

COLEMAN
Zuckerman? Nathan Zuckerman?
NATHAN
(suspicious)
Yeah?
COLEMAN

(he charges inside
without being asked)
We've got to talk.

NATHAN
I'm afraid--

ON COLEMAN--He turns on Nathan, suddenly suspicious.
COLEMAN
You are the Zuckerman that's the

writer? Correct?

NATHAN
Yeah, but--
10 CONTINUED:

10.

COLEMAN
Your last book won some sort of
prize, right?

NATHAN
(starting to get
pissed)
It was short listed for the--

COLEMAN
That was five years ago; what
happened?
(not waiting for an
answer)

Blocked? Right? You're blocked;
worried you don't have another
story in you? Well I can fix that.
I'm the answer to your prayers.
You know who I am?

NATHAN
(intrigued, at the
very least)

Dean Silk?

COLEMAN

Dean Coleman Silk, that's right,
the late, retired and now resigned
and unlamented Dean Silk,
following the MURDER ~ did you
clock that? -MURDER of my wife.

(faces him)
How's that grab you, Zuckerman?
Good enough to get your juices
flowing? Huh?

NATHAN
I'm not sure I under-

Throughout the following Coleman paces around the room,
pausing sometimes to pick up something only to immediately
put it down. Occasionally he sits only to jump to his feet
almost immediately and resume his pacing.

COLEMAN

Those sons of bitches killed my
wife, Nathan--you don't mind if I
call you Nathan?

(not waiting for an

answer)
They killed her as sure as if they
had taken a gun and fired it into
her heart. Who would have thought
Iris couldn't take it...
10 CONTINUED:

11.

(2) 10
COLEMAN (cont'd)
(reflective)
Strong as she was, brave as she

was.

(back to Nathan)
But their kind of stupidity was
too much even for a juggernaut
like Iris. Massive embolism. I got
her to the hospital, but it was
too late.

(fixing Nathan with

a look)
The point is they meant to kill
me, and they got her instead; all
in the name of political
correctness~-an oxymoron if I ever
heard one.

(pleased with himself)
There's your book, Zuckerman.

NATHAN
Look, Dean -

COLEMAN
Coleman, just Coleman. "All my
other titles I have given away" -

NATHAN
Look...ah, Coleman, I can see
you're devastated. And I'm sorry,
really sorry. But I write fiction--

COLEMAN

(cutting him off)
Believe me, this thing will read
like The Manchurian Candidate -
they murdered the wrong person,
for Chrissakes, and for what? One
word. "Spooks"? Let me tell you
something, Nathan.

(confidentially)
My father was a saloon keeper in
New Jersey--the only Jewish
saloonkeeper in East Orange. He
only got as far as the seventh
grade, but he insisted on the
precision of words and I have kept
faith with him.

(as though convincing

himself)
I have kept faith with him.

Coleman has run out of steam for the moment. Flops onto the
ratty sofa as Nathan studies him. Then, cautiously -
12.

10 CONTINUED: (3) 10

NATHAN
If you don't mind a suggestion,
maybe you ought to write this book
yourself.

Coleman considers this.

COLEMAN
Maybe so. Maybe I should at that.
(then, looking around
the room:)
You're divorced, right?

NATHAN
Does it show?

COLEMAN
Nathan, you have the look about
you of a man at loose ends.
(sighs)
Takes one to know one.

NATHAN
What's the moment called in Greek
tragedy - you know, the one where
the hero learns that everything he
knows is wrong?

COLEMAN
Peripeteia...

NATHAN
(rueful)
That's me.

TIGHT ON COLEMAN--He smiles - different from the killer grin.
Open.

COLEMAN
Nathan, by any chance do you play
Gin Rummy?

NATHAN'S VOICE OVER
And that was how our friendship
began.
Over this we HEAR: STOMPIN' AT THE SAVOY
11 EXT. COLEMAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT il
A big, white, rambling home, with lights on and MUSIC

blasting from within. The screened-in porch is lit up,
too...and inside we can see two FIGURES playing cards...
12

13

13.

INT. COLEMAN'S SCREEN-IN PORCH - NIGHT 12

ON A PING PONG TABLE with a computer, that is stacked high
with papers. THE CAMERA PANS ACROSS TO COLEMAN AND NATHAN
playing gin-rummy while drinking BEER from bottles.

ON COLEMAN--studying his hand.

COLEMAN
(nonchalant)
Why did you and your wife split up?

CROSS-CUTTING BETWEEN THEM:

NATHAN
Which wife--the first or the
second?

That gets Coleman's attention.

NATHAN
(continuing; grins)
You sure you want to discard that?

We HEAR Ella Fitzgerald singing "But Not For Me" as we CUT TO:
INT. LIVING ROOM, COLEMAN'S HOUSE - DAY 13

CLOSE ON A PHOTOGRAPH OF IRIS SILK--It is a black and white
photograph, we see her carrying a placard that reads,
"Freedom of Choice." And this is obviously a rally ata
women's clinic, because she is yelling at someone 0.S.. She
looks both alive and vital, beautiful and plain, angry and
thoroughly happy all at the same time. It sits on the
mantelpiece, surrounded by other photographs of his family.

WE REVERSE ON NATHAN--He takes the photograph from the
mantle, so that he can study it more carefully. Over this we
HEAR:

COLEMAN'S VOICE OVER
Forty years we were married...

ON THE DOOR LEADING FROM THE KITCHEN INTO THE LIVING ROOM --
coleman, in khakis and an oxford cloth, button down shirt,
frayed around the collar and shirt tail hanging out, stands
in the doorway holding two bottles of beer.

COLEMAN
Add on the six months we lived
together. That's not bad -
especially these days.

NATHAN
(sympathetic)
You must have loved her very much.
13

14

14.

CONTINUED: 13
COLEMAN .
After forty years, who could tell?
NATHAN
Kids?
COLEMAN

Jeff and Michael - both married
now, tenured professors out in
California. And then there's Mark,
the thorn in my side; Marky, for
whom nothing was ever quite good
enough.
(sighs)
He's an orthodox Jew, lives with
a dental technician, in Queens,
who supports him while he writes
long, angry, unpublishable poetry.
(picking up the
photograph of his
daughter, smiling)
And there's my Lisa, she's in New
York; teaches remedial reading.

Coleman studies the photograph of Lisa a moment longer - then
puts it down as the music changes again; Dick Haymes is
singing "Where or When."

INT. SCREENED IN PORCH - NIGHT 14

Once more we see the computer, if anything there are more
papers piled on the ping pong table. THE CAMERA PANS ACROSS
TO NATHAN AND COLEMAN. The gin rummy game continues; both men
whooping with hilarity as they slam down their cards. Nathan
steals a look at the ping-pong table - it is now COVERED with
documents, boxes, more files.

Nathan glances back and sees Coleman has caught his look.

COLEMAN
Hey, you're the guy that threw
away a chance at the Pulitzer, not
me.

ON NATHAN--not fazed in the least; he smiles, lays down his
cards.

NATHAN
Gin.
15.

15 INT./EXT. PORCH - ANOTHER EVENING 15

As Nathan takes a pull from the bottle of beer, nods toward
the ping-pong table: it's empty. On the floor, a lot of FILE
BOXES crammed with papers.

NATHAN
What's with the book?
COLEMAN
The book has come and gone.
NATHAN
Meaning?
(he nudges a box with
a toe)

Meaning it's worthless. You can't
make a college without breaking
egg-heads and I couldn't write a
book called Spooks that didn't
sound like a lunatic raving. All
this...

{nodding towards the

cartons of papers)
Useless; unless you count the
dubious thrill of re-reading old
love letters.

He takes several letters that he has obviously just been re-
reading and drops them on top of one of the boxes.

TIGHTER IN as a photograph falls out of one of the envelopes.
ON NATHAN--as he leans down and picks it up.

HIS POV: INSERT OF THE PHOTOGRAPH--It is a snapshot taken in
the late forties by a street photographer. It shows the young
Coleman Silk; his dark hair is closely cropped (in what used
to be called a GI cut); he wears a tweed jacket, oxford
cloth, button down shirt (not dissimilar to the one he is
wearing now), crew necked sweater. He is walking down the
street, with a stunningly beautiful blonde girl, their arms
around one another, laughing. However, what we notice most is
that the girl looks at him with total adoration.

ON NATHAN--looking from the photograph to Coleman.

NATHAN
This you?

COLEMAN
(wry)
Hey, I was young once.
15 CONTINUED:

16.

15
NATHAN
That's not what I meant. Who's the
girl?
COLEMAN
(taking the
photograph)

Her name's Steena Paulsen. She was
from Minnesota.

NATHAN
(with a look)
Forgive me, Coleman, but you don't
seem to me to be the Minnesota
type.

COLEMAN

(with a laugh)
There are depths about me, young
man, you will never plumb.

(then quickly:)
I met Steena when I was at NYU on
the GI bill. Almost married her.

(a beat:)
What would my life have been like
if I had.

As Coleman is talking "Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered"

starts to

play on the radio.

COLEMAN

(continuing; he stops

for a beat, savoring

the music)
Listen...I hear that and
everything within me unclenches
and the wish not to die, never to
die is almost too great to bear.

(then: )
Come on, let's dance...

NATHAN
(taken aback)
What?

COLEMAN
Dance. You and me. Don't worry,
Nathan, I'm not making a pass.
Come on, live a little.

 

NATHAN
Alright, but just don't sing in my
ear, okay?
17.

15 CONTINUED: (2) 15
And the two men start to dance.

NATHAN
(continuing)
You seem pretty cheerful for a man
whose book just tanked.

COLEMAN
(a beat, then:)
I'm having an affair, Nathan.

NATHAN
No kidding?

COLEMAN
No kidding,...I'm having an affair
with a thirty-four-year-old woman.
I can't tell you what it's done to

me.
NATHAN
I'm getting a pretty good idea...
COLEMAN
(with great
simplicity)

I thought I couldn't take any more
of anything. But...when this stuff
comes back so...late in life,
(thoughtfully)
Completely unexpected, completely
unwanted, it comes back at you
with such force and...when there's
nothing you can do about it, when
there's nothing to dilute it.

NATHAN
And when she's thirty-four.

COLEMAN

(grins)
And ignitable, Nathan. Ignitable.
Ever hear of something called
Viagra? Without it I would still
have the dignity befitting a man
my age and position. Without it I
could continue in my "declining
years" to draw profound
philosophical conclusions and have
a steadying moral influence on the
young.
18.

15 CONTINUED: (3) 15

COLEMAN (cont'd)
Without Viagra I would not be
doing something that makes no
sense, something that is ill
considered, and potentially
disastrous for all involved.

NATHAN
So exactly where did you find, "La
Belle Dame sans Merci"?

16 INT. ATHENA POST OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON 16

CLOSE ON FAUNIA FARLEY, the woman who was next to Coleman in
the fatal crash. WIDEN TO REVEAL her mopping the floor in
the one room Post Office.

A thin woman with high-cheekbones, and a certain aristocratic
carriage, she wears a cut-offs, a tee shirt and flip-flops.
She's the janitor.

There's a KNOCK on the door. She ignores it. The KNOCK is
repeated, insistently.

Finally, with an exasperated sigh, Faunia looks up.

HER POV - behind one of the glass door panes, a good-looking
older man - Coleman - is peering at her, frowning... holding
his hand to the glass like a salute so he can see inside...

FAUNIA
Closed.
(louder)
Closed!

He can't HEAR her but says something she can't make out.
KNOCKS on the glass again.

HIS POV - Faunia comes to the glass opposite - they stare at
each other, each face framed through the glass pane.

COLEMAN
I only want to use the stamp
machine to get a -!

FAUNIA
(muffled)
Can't you read?!

She points through the window to the sign where the post
office hours are posted -

19

19.

CONTINUED: 16
COLEMAN

Come on..! I just want to use the
damn machine...

He points at the vending machine over her shoulder. She gets
it, considers, shrugs, what the hell. Unlocks the door -

FAUNIA
Hurry it up, okay?

COLEMAN
Thanks... Thanks so much...

Coleman hastily goes inside. She looks briefly around - no
witnesses, and closes the door.

Inside, Coleman buys his book of stamps.
CLOSER ON FAUNIA--as she studies him.

FAUNIA
Couldn't wait till tommorrow?

COLEMAN
(smiles at her)
Look, I really appreciate it...

He takes his book of stamps and heads out. As she re-locks
the door we CUT TO:

EXT. ATHENA PUBLIC LIBRARY - DUSK 17
Another day. Coleman, wearing a different outfit, exits
carrying a stack of books. An ACADEMIC COUPLE he used to
know gives him a wide berth. Pretending he hasn't seen this
snub, Coleman gets in his Volvo and heads out of town.

INT. COLEMAN'S VOLVO - DUSK 18
On Coleman--Driving home when he spots something ahead:

HIS POV, through the windshield, we sees the SUN setting
behind a big, old Chevy parked on the side of the road and
leaning against it, smoking a cigarette - is the woman
janitor from the post office. She wears a short denim skirt
and a t-shirt. Behind her a sign: AUDUBON SOCIETY.

EXT. ROAD - SAME 19

WIDE SHOT--Coleman stops his car beside the Chevy.
20.

19 CONTINUED: 19

COLEMAN
(yelling through the
open window)
Car trouble?

FAUNIA
(shrugs)
Every other day.

COLEMAN
Can I give you a lift?

She looks at him, considering - flicks away the butt.
20 INT. COLEMAN'S VOLVO - LATER 20
Coleman drives.

COLEMAN
Where can I drop you?

FAUNIA
Nickerson's.

COLEMAN
The organic dairy?

FAUNIA
Yeah...Mind if I smoke?
(she lights up, not
waiting for an
answer)
There's two dykes that run it.
(inhaling deeply)
I get a room in exchange for doing
the milking.

COLEMAN
So you work in the post office AND
the dairy...

FAUNIA
And the college. "Faunia Farley,
Custodial Staff". Says so on my
name tag.

COLEMAN

(eyes on the road)
Sounds like you keep busy.

FAUNIA
Action is the enemy of thought.

CLOSER ON COLEMAN--That gets his attention; he looks at her.
21.

20 CONTINUED: 20

COLEMAN
Who said that?

HIS POV; CLOSE ON FAUNIA-~staring out the windshield. She
exhales a long plume of smoke. We see that, much as she tries
to hide it, she is very beautiful.

FAUNIA
Jesus,. you ask a lot of questions.

COLEMAN
(reluctantly bringing
his eyes back to the
road)
You must know Smokey Hollenbeck.

FAUNIA
Smokey hired me.

COLEMAN
(glancing in her
direction)
And I hired Smokey.

FAUNIA
(looks him in the eye)
I know you did.

Coleman holds her look for a moment longer than necessary
before turning his eyes back to the road.

21 EXT. BARN AT THE DAIRY - TWILIGHT 21

WIDE SHOT--as Coleman's Volvo drives into an open area
between a large dairy barn and several outbuildings. It comes
to a stop.

22 INT. VOLVO - SAME 22
There is a beat of silence, then:

FAUNIA
Well, I guess this is the end of
the line. Thanks for the lift.

COLEMAN
I enjoyed it. I can't tell you how
long it's been since I've sat next
to an attractive--

As he is talking, Faunia takes a cigarette, starts to light
it.

22 CONTINUED: 22

COLEMAN
(continuing; quickly
reaching for the
matches)

Here...

He strikes a match and lights her cigarette.

TIGHTER ON THEM--as she puts her hand up and rests it gently
on his hand.

TIGHTER ON HER as she blows out the match.

FAUNIA
You wanna’ come in?

COLEMAN

(suddenly flustered)
Me? Thanks, but no...ah, I don't
think...

(then: )
Look, this may sound odd, but ah,
I haven't been this close to a
woman since--

FAUNIA

(finishing his

sentence)
Since your wife died. I know all
about it. Look, let's get
something straight, my friend. If
you're looking for sympathy,
you've come to the wrong place.

(inhaling deeply)
Sympathy's definitely not my
specialty.

(then as she gets

out:)
In any case thanks for the ride.

COLEMAN'S POV as she walks inside one of the buildings,
leaving the door open behind her.

CLOSE ON COLEMAN--He stares at her long after she has
disappeared, then looking up, he spots his reflection in the
rearview mirror--grins.

COLEMAN
Action is the enemy of thought.

As he opens the door and gets out of the car we CUT TO:

INT. OUTBUILDING - SAME 23
ON THE DOOR-~-as he pushes open the door.

HIS POV: Although there is very little light we can see a
stairway leading to the second floor where a door is open and
a light on inside the room.

ON COLEMAN--as he starts up the stairs.
INT. FAUNIA'S ROOM - SAME 24

ON COLEMAN--as. he steps inside. THE CAMERA PANS ACROSS TO
FAUNIA in bed; although the covers are around her we can see
that she is naked beneath them--clearly waiting for him.

CLOSER ON COLEMAN--He looks at her for a long beat and THE
CAMERA MOVES WITH HIM as he crosses to Faunia, sits beside
her on the bed.

ON FAUNIA--as he does she reaches up, wraps her arms around
his neck and draws him to her. As they kiss we FADE TO BLACK:

INT. FAUNIA'S ROOM AT THE DAIRY - LATER 25
It is obvious they have just made love.

FAUNIA
Now then, you gotta get out of
here. Nothing personal, but I
don't get my beauty sleep, I don't
wake in time to do the milking...

COLEMAN
Will I see you again?

FAUNIA
(guffawing)
Hell, you can't much miss me.

ON COLEMAN~-He leans forward, starts to kiss the inside of
her wrist, stops:

INSERT; HIS POV: across the wrist we see an ugly red scar.
THE CAMERA WHIP PANS ACROSS TO HER FACE--she looks at him
with a steady gaze.

FAUNIA
(continuing)
The question is, will I see you

again?
Te: now that you've seen my wrist scars?

By way of answer, Coleman leans down and kisses her
passionately on the mouth.

TIGHT ON THE INTENSE KISS - as Coleman pulls away, Faunia's
eyes are still closed, but there's a little smile-

FAUNIA
(continuing; barely
a whisper)
Now you're talking...

INT. BARTON HALL, ATHENA CAMPUS - EVENING 26
The corridor deserted at this hour. Over this we hear:

NATHAN'S VOICE OVER
But they did see each other again
and again.

INT. ENGLISH CLASSROOM, BARTON HALL - EVENING 27

Faunia is dusting, collecting trash, etc. A car HORN. She
looks out the window.

HER POV - Coleman's Volvo out in front.

Faunia's face: no change of expression but she tugs the
kerchief out of her hair...

EXT. BARTON HALL, ATHENA CAMPUS - MOMENTS LATER 28

Faunia runs out the door towards the car; as she does she

brushes past a woman carrying a briefcase. Faunia reaches

Coleman's Volvo, jumps inside and as the door slams behind
her we

REVERSE ON THE WOMAN SHE PASSED--who turns to look. It is
Delphine Roux, the woman we saw at the "Spooks" héaring. She
watches the car drive away, her face a mask.

INT. COLEMAN'S PORCH - NIGHT 29

Nathan and Coleman are playing gin. Nathan is dealing, his
eyes on Coleman.

NATHAN

You ought to know something,
Coleman--the jungle drums are
beating, you know the sort of
thing... "Small college town.
Distinguished professor flips out,
seen entering pharmacy, clutching
prescription."

(he discards)
29 CONTINUED:

COLEMAN
(studying his hand)
Ummm...
(then:)
Are you certain you want to
discard that?

NATHAN

Yes.

(watching as Coleman

takes his discard)
Coleman, are you listening? Right
now we're living at a time and in
a country where people are doing
everything they can to bring down
the President .-

COLEMAN
Who happens to be a jerk...

NATHAN
Nevertheless, if they're doing
that to him, they sure as Hell
won't hesitate to go after you.
We can't just -

COLEMAN

(looking up at Nathan)
Can I stop you right there? If
there's one word I've struggled
with all my life, Nathan, it's the
tyrannical word "we." We must, we
can't, we don't. I'm not talking
about we, I'm talking about me.
I'm not hurting anyone, I'm not
breaking any laws.

(grins)
I'm just having fantastic sex.

(laying down his

cards)

CLOSE ON NATHAN--studying his friend.

NATHAN
(with a look)
Coleman, there is no such thing as
just having fantastic sex.

30 EXT. COLEMAN'S HOUSE - LATE AT NIGHT 30

ESTABLISHING SHOT--The house is dark.
26.

31 INT. COLEMAN'S BEDROOM ~ NIGHT 31

The clock on a table beside the bed says: 12:15. THE CAMERA
MOVES ACROSS TO COLEMAN--who is awake watching Faunia whose
eyes are closed.

COLEMAN
What are you thinking?
FAUNIA
I'm thinking you're going to ruin
it.
COLEMAN
No I'm not.
FAUNIA
You are. "What are you thinking?"

Why can't you leave well enough
alone? Why do we have to talk?

He looks at her, says nothing - she relents.

FAUNIA
(continuing; opening
her eyes, looking at
him)
Alright, have it your way. I'm
thinking I'm a crow.

COLEMAN
A crow... Why do you-

FAUNIA
Uh uh. Your turn.

He's not sure where to begin -

COLEMAN
I was wondering what it was like
making love -

FAUNIA
Fucking -

COLEMAN
All right, "fucking". What's it
like "fucking" an old man?

FAUNIA
Perfect; no surprises. What's it
like being out of a job?

COLEMAN
Lonely. Like you, I suspect. My
turn?
27.

31 CONTINUED: 31
She doesn't contradict him -

COLEMAN
(continuing)
Aside from that dumb car, you
don't seem to have any
possessions. I mean, there's not
even a calendar on the wall--

She stops Coleman and begins to kiss him with great passion.

COLEMAN
(continuing; coming
up for air)
Action is the enemy of thought?

She sits up, annoyed -

FAUNIA

All right! My life story, is that
what you want?

(fires up a cigarette)
Fine. I used to have lots of
"possessions". My father was
rich, I mean really rich. I grew
up in a big house outside of
Boston, oriental rugs, fireplaces
in every room, a staff of
servants-- the whole nine yards.

(noticing his look)
You don't believe me?

COLEMAN
Yes. Yes, I do.

She settles back, blowing smoke -

FAUNIA
Then my parents got divorced. My
mother remarried - another rich
guy. The thing is this one
couldn't keep his hands off me.
(a beat:)
Bedtime stories were his
speciality - sweetheart, lemme
read you a story. Before I knew it
he had his fingers in my cunt--
(uneasy)
Look, you don't have to -
31 CONTINUED:

28.

(2) 31
FAUNIA
(sharp)
Hey, you asked.
(then: )

I told my mother, but she didn't

believe me. Nobody believed me.

When I was fourteen he tried to

fuck me. That's when I split.
(shrugs)

No possessions. I travel light.

COLEMAN
I'm really -

She sits up abruptly -

FAUNIA

What's that?
COLEMAN

What's w-
FAUNIA

Sssh!

They listen. Dead silence except for crickets...

COLEMAN

It's nothing. What could it be?
FAUNIA

It's Les.
COLEMAN

Les? Who's -?

FAUNIA
(peeks out the window)
My ex-husband. He works at a
garage in town. Follows me
around...shit.

COLEMAN
(slipping on his
trousers)
If he's bothering you, I'll deal
with him...
FAUNIA

(alarmed whisper)
No!
31 CONTINUED

She grabs

COLEMAN
Hey, once upon a time I was
counted a pretty fair boxer...

him -

FAUNIA

This is no joke. He's out of his
mind. He was in Viet Nam...Two
tours of duty. He used to kill
gooks and keep their ears on a
string. Just...

(she listens, then

releases him)
Maybe I imagined it.

She sits on the bed, shaking. He puts an arm around her.

FAUNIA
(continuing)
If I moved in my sleep he thought
it was gooks. Used to beat me so
bad...one time I was in a coma.

COLEMAN
Jesus... Why does he follow you?

FAUNIA
He's crazy, I told you.
(then she gets to her
feet and starts to
dress)
I've got to go.

COLEMAN
(concerned)
Stay.
FAUNIA
No.
(then:)

No, I never stay.

32 INT. DAIRY BARN - THE NEXT MORNING 32

ON FAUNIA--She wears shorts, high, rubber boots and a tee-
shirt, not exactly romantic, but on her the effect is
curiously carnal. She moves through her morning routine of

milking.

She nudges a COW into position -
30.

32 CONTINUED: 32
FAUNIA
C'mon Maggie, that's a good girl...
(then: )
Move your ass, Flossie you old
bitch.

Suddenly Faunia realizes that she isn't alone; she looks 0O.S.
smiles:

COLEMAN SILK--Who knows how long he has been standing
watching her;

COLEMAN
(returning her smile)
Hi...

ON FAUNIA--She looks at him and nods; there is an unexpected
dignity in her gaze.

COLEMAN

(continuing)
I, ah...got to thinking and...ah,
when you reach my age it wouldn't
hurt if I were to start drinking
more milk. I mean...

(embarrassed)
Calcium--that sort of thing.

FAUNIA
(amused)
The milk's in that old fridge by
the door. Leave a couple of
dollars in the mason jar on the
top.

COLEMAN
Fine...

Nevertheless, he doesn't move.

CLOSE ON FAUNIA IN A SERIES OF DISSOLVES WE SEE: Faunia
gently, but firmly shoving the cows into position. We see her
attaching the cups to the cows teats and massaging the
udders. There are patches of sweat between her shoulder
blades and beneath her breasts. Her shorts are ripped along
the side and we note that she isn't wearing underwear. This
is all powerfully erotic without being premeditated in the
least. Coleman watches, mesmerized. All through this she is
talking to him.

FAUNIA
Come on, Daisy... After I left
Boston, I was in Florida for a
while, doing this and that.
31.

32 CONTINUED: (2) 32

FAUNIA (cont'd)
A girl like me can always get by.
Hand me that hose - the red one-

Coleman hands it to her - enchanted by her sensual movements
as she goes about her work... her hands...

FAUNIA

(continuing)
Then I got tired of that, came up
here and married - guess what - a
dairy farmer. Lester Farley. I
was 20...

(she looks at Coleman

who is watching her)
What are you looking at?

CLOSER ON COLEMAN--Hew smiles, shrugs.

TIGHT ON FAUNIA--She returns the smile, then goes back to
work.

FAUNIA
(continuing)

I remember one time we got in this
huge fight in the barn and I threw
cow shit at him. He threw cow shit
back at me; next thing you know
we're both covered in cow shit and
laughing like hell. Best day of
the marriage.

COLEMAN
(more to make
conversation than
anything)
You never had kids?

FAUNIA
(a beat:)
No. No kids.

33 INT. VA HOSPITAL - DAY 33

CLOSE ON LESTER FARLEY-~He is the same man who we saw in the
opening sequence, sitting in the truck; the same man who ran
Coleman Silk and Faunia off the road.

PSYCHOLOGIST (0.S.)
Did you ever kill anyone in
Vietnam, Mr. Farley?
32.

33 CONTINUED: : 33

LES

(he looks around

amused)
Did I kill anyone?

(taking out a pack of

cigarettes)
Wasn't that what I was supposed to
do when they sent me to Vietnam?
Fucking kill gooks? They said
everything goes so...I guess
everything went. You have a match?

A moment later someone from 0.S. hands him a pack of matches.

LES

(continuing; good

manners)
Thanks.

(he lights his

cigarette, inhales)
Look, let's get something straight
right off the bat, I never hurt
her, okay? Never. And I never hurt
the kids. That was all lies. She
never cared about anyone but
herself. I should've never let her
go off with the kids. She--

(interrupting himself
You sure you don't mind me smoking?

 

PSYCHOLOGIST (O.S.)
Not at all.

LES

She waited until I was in rehab.
That's why she wanted to get me in
rehab to start with, so she could
take the kids. She used the whole
thing against me to get the kids
away. She had no right to steal my
kids. And now she's fucking this
old Jew.

(quietly)
I should've killed her back then.

34 INT. VERMONT "MADAMASKA INN" RESTAURANT - NIGHT 34
Coleman has taken to Faunia to a candlelit dinner at a New

England gourmet inn. Faunia is nicely dressed; Coleman wears
a tie.
33.

34 CONTINUED: 34
FAUNIA
(uneasy)
I don't know why we had to do
this...
COLEMAN
(smiles)

It's a meal, not a commitment.

FAUNIA
(suspicious)
Have it your way.

VOICE
Hope I'm not late...

They look up. It's Nathan.

TIGHT ON FAUNIA--She turns to Coleman with the look of ‘an
animal caught in a trap.

COLEMAN
(to Nathan)
We just got here.
(to Faunia, ignoring
her look)
Faunia, I'd like you to meet my
friend Nathan.

NATHAN
Hi.

He extends his hand, which she ignores, glaring at Coleman.
Nathan sits, recovering, just then the maitre'd appears
hovering at Faunia's shoulder.

MAITRE'D
(handing her a menu)
Madame the specialty of the house
is game...
(pointing)
Perhaps the venison.

Silence.

MAITRE'D

(continuing)
Or perhaps Madame would prefer the
fish. In that case I would
recommend this...

(pointing to one item

on the menu)
Or this...
34.

34 CONTINUED: (2) 34

36

She slams the menu into the waiter.

FAUNIA
Whatever he's having...
(indicating Coleman)
Ditto for me.

QUICK CUT NATHAN--as he suddenly realizes that Faunia cannot
read.

TIGHT ON FAUNIA--who interprets Nathan's avoidance of his
friend's gaze correctly.

FAUNIA
(continuing)
That's right, Mr. Zuckerman. I
can't read.
And she's out of there. Coleman is on his feet now -

NATHAN
Coleman -

COLEMAN
(going after her)
Look, I'm sorry -

NATHAN
Another time...

COLEMAN
Right...

Nathan sits alone at the table set for three...
EXT. MADAMASKA INN - NIGHT 35

Coleman pursuing Faunia as she storms into his VOLVO. As
Coleman climbs into the driver's side,

INT. COLEMAN'S VOLVO - SAME 36
She's staring straight ahead...

FAUNIA
Full of surprises, aren't you?

COLEMAN
Take it easy. He's my friend,
okay? I wanted you to get to know
one another.

CONTINUED: 36

FAUNIA

Because you're so proud of me,
right?

(lighting a cigarette)
You've really come down in the
world, haven't you? Dean of
Faculty, professor of classics -
and look at you, fucking a
cleaning lady who can't. even
fucking read..!

Coleman says nothing. There's nothing he can say.

FAUNIA
(continuing; her
voice. quiet)

You're going to drop me now,
aren't you?

COLEMAN
Why are you always-

FAUNIA
Because you're not up to fucking
somebody who can't read. That's
what you were thinking -

It's exactly what he was thinking, but Coleman kisses her
hard, his hands on her breasts.

COLEMAN
You're wrong. I'm going to fuck
you extra hard because you can't
read.

FAUNIA
(throaty laugh)
Now you're talking.

EXT. VOLVO - SAME 37

Coleman's car pulls out and THE CAMERA PANS OVER TO REVEAL
THE RED PICK-UP (the same one that forced Coleman's car off
the road earlier). After a pause the pick-up's engine rumbles
to life and it begins to follow the Volvo.

EXT. THE DAIRY - NIGHT 38

We see Coleman's Volvo parked near the small house where
Faunia stays. All the lights are out; everything is quiet.
THE CAMERA PANS AWAY FROM THE VOLVO, PAST THE BARN AND COMES
TO REST ON THE RED PICK UP. It moves slowly around the corner
of the barn, lights off, and comes to a stop facing the
house, the motor idling.

CLOSE ON THE TRUCK--Through the window we see the flare of a
match as Lester Farley lights a cigarette.

INT. FAUNIA'S ROOM AT THE DAIRY -SAME 39

The room is dark, lit only by the moonlight coming through
the windows. THE CAMERA PANS ACROSS TO THE BED where Faunia
and Coleman lay sleeping, wrapped around one another. THE
CAMERA MOVES INTO A CLOSE SHOT OF FAUNIA as she comes wide
awake. In the distance we hear the sound of Lester's truck
idling. Her sudden motion brings Coleman awake.

COLEMAN
What is it? What's wrong?

FAUNIA
(a whisper)
It's Les. He's out there. I can
hear the truck.

In the silence we can hear the engine of the truck as Les
revs the engine slightly.

Coleman grabs for his trousers.

COLEMAN
I'll take care of this.

FAUNIA
(panic)
No, don't! He's crazy.

But it is too late. Coleman has his trousers on and is
pulling a sweater over his head.

EXT. BARN - MOMENTS LATER 40

As we watch, the high beams of the truck are turned on. A
moment later Lester Farley appears in front of the truck
silhouetted against the glare of the headlights.

LES
(yelling)
Come out of there you murdering
bitch!

ON THE DOOR--as it opens and Coleman steps outside holding a
tire iron.

COLEMAN
Come here you. I wanna talk to you!

CLOSER ON LES: locking eyes with Coleman.
37.

40 CONTINUED: 40

LES

Did she tell you?! Did she?! I bet
not!

(shouting so Faunia

can hear)
I bet you fucking didn't!

(back to Coleman)
Did she tell you she was giving
some guy a blow job while her kids
were catching fire? Did she?

COLEMAN
Get out of here before I brain you!

LES
Put that fucking thing down before
I ram it through your fucking
skull!

FAUNIA'S VOICE
Les!

TIGHT ON LES--He stops, looks at her. At the sight of her his
face suffuses with pain.

HIS POV: Faunia stands just outside the door, now she is
wearing Coleman's shirt and baggy work pants. She holds up a
revolver for him to see.

FAUNIA
(from her tone of
voice she is
practiced in dealing
with her ex-husband)
Don't try anything, Les. I've
already called the police.

CLOSE ON LES--He stands in the open area, staring at his
wife, his chest heaving.

LES
You murdering, fucking cunt!

In the distance we hear a police siren approaching.

COLEMAN
Get the fuck away from here.

Just then a squad car with lights and sirens roars up.
CLOSE ON LES~-He freezes.

ON THE SQUAD CAR--The doors open and two cops race towards
Les.

Come on, Les...

FAUNIA
Watch out -!

at one of the cops, two more grab him from behind.

He struggles but to no avail.

LES
Fucking payback for what I did in
'Nam -!

The COPS have tackled Les but it isn't easy. They wrestle him
to the ground and drag him to the squad car.

LES

(continuing)
Rehab again, right?! Thorazine
for breakfast, right?! Fucking
government. This is the fucking
thanks I get for serving my
country--for all the shit I went
through.

(as they drag him

back towards the

police car)
They didn't give us a fucking
chance. They say we lost the war.
We didn't lose the war, the
fucking government lost the war.
I walked the walk, man. You can't
know the shit I've seen. And then
I come home to this!

The COPS have reached the squad car, they open the back door

VERY TIGHT ON LES--as they force him into the back seat, he

stares at

his wife with a terrifying ferocity.

LES
(continuing)
Fucking a goddamn carpenter while
her kids are on fire! I shoulda
killed you and my kids when I had
the chance - !

As the door slams, blocking him from view, we CUT TO:

41 INT. FAUNIA'S ROOM AT THE DAIRY - LATER 41

Faunia sits on the edge of the bed, shivering. Coleman is
beside her, saying nothing, watching her patiently. Finally

FAUNIA
(a whisper)
You wanted to know why I didn't
have any possessions. Well, now I
guess you found out...

She fumbles under the bed. Fishes out a small URN and places
it on her lap.

FAUNIA

(continuing; stares

at it)
This is what's left of my kids.

(a long beat)
It was an accident. A space
heater tipped over and the place
caught fire.

Tears stand in her eyes - spill down her cheeks...

FAUNIA

(continuing;

clutching it to her

breast, rocking it)
I can never figure out what to do
with them. Keep them? Bury them?
My sole remaining "possession" and
I don't know what to do with it.
You got any bright ideas,
Professor? Or is this all too
trailer trash for you?

He puts his arms around her, allowing her choking sobs -

COLEMAN

It's all right. It's over. It's
all over now...

INT. LISA'S TINY NYC APT. - MORNING 43

Lisa, at her cluttered desk, filled with paperwork. She's
attractive, with her mother's important hair but without
Iris' aura of authority. Lisa is always overwhelmed.

And just now upset as well, curt...

LISA
I said I'm fine.

INTERCUT WITH a puzzled COLEMAN -

COLEMAN

You don't sound fine.

(no reply)
How's the class coming?

(smiles)
What happened to the little kid
who couldn't recognize the letter
N? Did he ever get it? Lisa?

LISA
Everything's fine.

COLEMAN
(frowns)
Would you care to know how I am?

LISA
I know how you are.

COLEMAN
(vague premonition)
Do you?

She's staring into space, passing a hand over her forehead.

COLEMAN

Sweetheart, what's the matter?

INSERT: A NEATLY FOLDED PIECE OF TYPING PAPER--written in big
block letters with a red ball point pen we read: "EVERYONE
KNOWS YOU'RE EXPLOITING AN ABUSED ILLITERATE WOMAN HALF YOUR
AGE."

NELSON .PRIMUS'S VOICE OVER
Everyone knows you're exploiting
an abused illiterate woman half
your age.

REVERSE ON NELSON PRIMUS, Coleman's attorney, an amiable
fellow in his thirties; he wears a suit that hints of Ralph
Lauren more than Brooks Brothers. Nelson rapidly rereads the
letter, mumbling the words together-

NELSON
"Evéryone knows you're exploiting
an abused illiterate woman half
your age."

A grim smile as he sets aside the letter and looks O.S.:

NELSON

Well, if this doesn't take the

CROSS-CUT TO COLEMAN--pacing back and forth in front of his
attorney's desk.

Yes you are, same as when you
resigned from the college, just as
the whole "Spooks" thing was on
the point of blowing over. I told
you then -

COLEMAN
And I told you: they killed my
wife! What else could I-?

NELSON
Coleman. Slow down. SIT.

Reluctantly, Coleman obeys. Nelson studies him.

NELSON
(continuing)
Listen to me, professor. Forget
about the letter. You got bigger
fish to fry. What are you going to
do about Lester Farley?
44 CONTINUED: (2)

COLEMAN
Get a restraining order, an
injunction, I don't know...

NELSON

A restraining order. Have you any
idea what you're getting into
here, Coleman? What it looks like
from the outside?

(leaning back in his

chair)
After thirty-some years of
academic distinction ina
community you virtually created
from scratch, suddenly you've gone
off the deep end. You want me, to
fight a legal war for you on two
fronts - one of them with a
phantom correspondent and the
other with a psychotic who's been
locked up twice in the mental ward
at the VA hospital in Northampton,
under real restraints, not legal
ones.

Before Coleman can get in a word -

NELSON

(continuing)
Sure I can get a restraining
order, but will that restrain him?
I can get you a handwriting
expert. I can get you a
bulletproof vest. But what I can't
provide is what you're never going
to know as long as you're involved
with this woman: a scandal-free,
Farley-free life. Is she HIV
negative, by the way? Did you
have her tested, Coleman? Did you
use a condom, Coleman? And if you
don't use protection, does SHE?
How do you know she doesn't want
to use you to help make up for
what she's lost? Do I represent
you in the paternity suit, Coleman?

COLEMAN
I can handle Lester if I have to-

NELSON
But why do you have to? Give up
the girl, Achilles.

43.

44 CONTINUED:

44,

(3) 44

COLEMAN
(stiffening)
I beg your pardon?

NELSON

(grins)
I took your intro to European lit
umpteen years ago as an undergrad.
Never forgot your lectures on
Homer. Achilles, listen to me: you
have to give up the girl. Give
her up and your troubles go away.
I'm speaking as your friend as
well as your attorney. Faunia
Farley is not in your league and
she's not from your world. Last
night you got a good look at her
world - Coleman, the fact is she
ain't worth it.

(a amiable smile)
Achilles on Viagra - how much
sense does that make anyway?

Coleman looks up at him - he's pale with fury. But when he
speaks, it is with deadly quiet -

COLEMAN
Are you quite finished?

The tone gives Nelson pause. Coleman rises to his feet.

COLEMAN
(continuing)
You're a genuine vocal master,
Nelson. And so rich with contempt
for every last human problem
you've never had to face.

NELSON
Listen, I was only -

COLEMAN
You listen: I never again want to
hear that self-admiring voice of
yours - or see your smug, lily
white face.

And with that he turns and stalks out. We HOLD ON THE OPEN
DOOR to the outer office as Nelson's secretary sticks her

head in.

SECRETARY
Is anything wrong, Mr. Primus?
44

45

45.

CONTINUED: (4) 44
ON NELSON--he stands looking after Coleman.

NELSON
(to himself,
perplexed)
What the hell do you suppose he
meant by, "lily white."

WHAM! The SOUND of a PUNCH: landing -!

INT. GYMNASIUM BOXING RING - DAY 45
TIGHT ON AN IRISH KID--big, although he cannot be more than
eighteen as he takes the jab, blinks in surprise; then lashes
out in a fury.

TIGHT ON THE YOUNG COLEMAN SILK--aged 17 as he easily steps
away from his opponenent's punch, feints with his left and
slams a right hook into the Irish kids mid-section.

Note: As Coleman boxes, we notice the barest trace of a smile
on his face; he knows just how good he is.

 

THEN IN A SERIES OF VERY QUICK CUTS we watch as Coleman bores
in on his opponent, easily dancing out of the way each time
the other boy tries to throw a punch. Over this we
SUPERIMPOSE: "EAST ORANGE, NEW JERSEY 1944." Then, as the
bell rings we CUT TO:

WIDER ANGLE--We see we're in a GYMNASIUM, where a group of
twenty-five or thirty men have crowded around a boxing ring,
cheering on the two young men.

IN COLEMAN'S CORNER, DOC CHIZNER, Coleman's coach. A Dentist
in his 50's, Doc coaches kids but also referees big matches
in Madison Square Garden. Coleman, covered with sweat,
breathing hard returns to his corner, drops onto a stool.

DOC
Coleman, wait for it! Wait for it!
Let him do the work...Ah..!

As Doc and the CUTMAN work him over:

DOC

(continuing)
Listen to me, kid. You're smarter
than him, you read me? Smarter.
He's a putz. You counter punch.

(tapping him on the

side of the face)
Coleman, pay attention...
45

46

46.

CONTINUED: 45

Coleman, breathing deeply, staring at his opponent across the
ring, nods.

DOC
(continuing)
Counter punch. That's your game.

Just then the bell sounds. Coleman charges out. As Doc
watches, Coleman puts his strategy to devastating

effect -it's like previews of Mohammed Ali. Coleman dancing
away, dodging the punches - he's enjoying himself, enjoying
using his brains in this brawny situation... bobbing and
weaving. And then - WHAM! the counter punch from nowhere. As
the Irish kid drops to his knees.

EXT. GYMNASIUM - LATER 46

ON THE DOOR--as it opens and the young Coleman, carrying a
gym bag in one hand and a stack of books in the other, steps
out. He holds the door open for Doc Chizner.

DOC
Next week, West Point...

COLEMAN
(worried)
Doc, that guy's got five pounds on
me.

THE CAMERA TRACKS WITH THE TWO MEN as they walk towards Doc
Chizner's car.

DOC
(confident)
But he's slow. You can take him
easy. Besides the Pitt coach is
gonna' be there. He's a buddy of
mine. I want him to see you fight.

COLEMAN
So?

They walk in silence for several beats, then:

DOC
So, once he sees you fight and
once I tell him about your grades,
I'm pretty sure he'll offer you a
scholarship to Pitt.

COLEMAN
(shakes his head)
I can't go to Pitt. My father
wants me to go to Howard.
47.

46 CONTINUED: 46

47

DOC
He's an optician, your dad?

COLEMAN
Used to be, he lost his business
in the depression.

By now they have reached Doc Chizner's car.
. boc
Look, Coleman, just box for the
guy. That's all. Then let's see
what happens.

He starts to get into the car, stops, turns back to Coleman.

DOC
(continuing;
embarrassed to be
saying this)
One thing. When you meet the guy
from Pitt, don't tell him you're
colored, okay?

COLEMAN
Don't tell him?

DOC
Don't bring it up. You're neither
one thing or the other. You're
Silky Silk. That's all.

COLEMAN
He won't know?

DOC
How's he gonna know? Here's the
top kid from East Orange High and
he's with Doc Chizner; he's gonna
think you're Jewish.

And with that, Doc gets into the car and drives away as we
HOLD ON YOUR COLEMAN watching the car disappear a thoughtful
look on his face.

EXT. ALLEYWAY, EAST ORANGE - TWILIGHT 47
TRACKING WITH COLEMAN--as he races down the alleyway, pushes

his way through a back gate and dashes up a short staircase,

two steps at a time.

ON THE BACK DOOR--where his sister ERNESTINE, a light skinned
African American girl of fifteen is waiting for him.

ERNESTINE
(an urgent whisper)
You're late!
INT. SILK HOUSE, EAST ORANGE, NJ - NIGHT 48

As Coleman pushes through the door, hands Ernestine his gym
bag.

COLEMAN
I know. Hide this for me willya-

THE CAMERA MOVES WITH THEM as they walk through the kitchen
toward the dining room.

ERNESTINE
Walter's home on leave -!

INT. SILK DINING ROOM - EVENING 49

ON THE DOOR--as Coleman steps through the door into the
dining room; it is attractively but inexpensively furnished.
Framed reproductions of flower painting and landscapes are on
the walls.

THE CAMERA PANS ACROSS TO THE DINING TABLE where the Silk
family sits at dinner. Coleman's parents are light-skinned
African Americans.

Coleman's MOTHER is a primly attractive woman who sits very
straight in her chair - a nurse by profession.

Coleman's FATHER is a barrel-chested man with intelligent
features. He wears a tasteful, but inexpensive suit.

The atmosphere in the room has a definite chill.

ON COLEMAN--as he takes a seat next to his brother WALTER,
who is wearing a spiffy army uniform -

COLEMAN
Sorry, I'm late--

ON COLEMAN'S FATHER--who says nothing, doesn't look up at his
son.

WALTER
(coming to Coleman's
rescue)
What's this I hear about you being
class Valedictorian?

Mr. Silk continues to eat, saying nothing. Walter throws a
glance toward Coleman. Coleman shrugs.
49.

49 CONTINUED: 49

Just then Ernestine enters the room having stashed Coleman's
gym bag somewhere.

ERNESTINE
Hey, with the only four point o
grade average, who else were they--

MRS. SILK
Yes, we're very proud of Coleman.

Nothing. Mr. Silk doesn't bother to look up.

MR. SILK
(icy)
May I inquire how you did, Coleman?

TIGHT ON COLEMAN--again he shoots Walter a look, this time
Walter shrugs.

COLEMAN
How I did?

MR. SILK
Night before last, at the Knights
of Pythias arena. I'm asking
whether you won or lost your bout.

COLEMAN

(furious, to
Ernestine)
Did you tell them?

However before she can reply:

MR. SILK
Kindly answer my question.
COLEMAN
(glum)
I won.
MR. SILK
(like a prosecuting
attorney)
And how many fights have you won
so far?
COLEMAN
(quiet)
Eleven.
MR. SILK

And how many have you lost?
49 CONTINUED:

50.

(2) 49
COLEMAN
None, so far.
MR. SILK
(acid)

And when are you planning on
turning professional?

WALTER

(coming to Coleman's
defense)
Dad, he's only--

MR. SILK
(not bothering to
even look at Walter)
This does not concern you, Walter.
(to Coleman)
I asked you a question, young man.

COLEMAN
(eyes averted)
Doc says I could get an athletic
scholarship, maybe to Pitt.

MR. SILK

Like Walter, you will go to
Howard. And after Howard, should
you choose to become a doctor, you
will not be doing your hands any
good, pummeling them in a boxing
ring.

(getting to his feet)
You know, if I were your father,
Coleman, you know what I'd tell
you now?

COLEMAN
You are my father.

MR. SILK
I'm not at all sure. I was
thinking that Doc Chizner was your
father.

COLEMAN
He's my coach, that's all. He
teaches me how to fight. You're
my father.

MR. SILK
Well if I were your father, you
know what I'd tell you now?
Sl.

COLEMAN
(his voice a whisper)
What.

MR. SILK

I would say, "You won last night.
Good. Now you can retire
undefeated."

(firm)
You're retired.

(getting to his feet)
Now, if you'll excuse me, I don't
want to miss my train.

A SHRILL TRAIN WHISTLE OVER..!
INT. PENNSYLVANIA RAILROAD DINING CAR - DAY 50
Filled with DINERS and uniformed WAITERS bustling among white

tablecloths, Mr. Silk, among them, carrying an overloaded
TRAY.

DINER
Boy, this fish is overcooked...

MR. SILK
Sorry, sir...

DINER
I'd like to change my order...

MR. SILK
Yes, sir, very good, sir,...

He picks up the man's plate, puts it on the laden tray along
with food, glasses and utensils, starts back to the galley -

Suddenly he collapses, bringing down dishes with a CRASH!
that startles everyone in the dining car.

EXT. EAST ORANGE CEMETERY - DAY 51
A dreary spot. A knot of MOURNERS across from Mr. Silk's
coffin. Mrs. Silk upright as always, her hair now tinged
with GREY, a handkerchief to her mouth, holds Ernestine's
hand.

Ernestine's tears stream silently down...

THE MINISTER
"Cowards die many times before
their deaths; the valiant never
taste of death but once."
Clarence Silk knew well those
lines from Julius Caesar. But I
don't think there's any question
here about who was valiant.

PAN TO COLEMAN, stunned -
The coffin now lowered into the ground...

THE MINISTER'S VOICE
Ashes to ashes...

INT. (COLEMAN'S) DARK ROOM - EVENING 52

At first we don't know where we are. Then a DOOR is opened,
revealing a SILHOUETTE -

MRS. SILK
Coleman?

COLEMAN
Leave it off...Please...

MRS. SILK
Alright.

She closes the door and walks tentatively towards Coleman,
who lies in his bed. Gradually, our eyes become accustomed to
the dark; his mother sits on the edge of the bed.

She's in her crisp, starched white NURSE'S UNIFORM -

COLEMAN
You on duty? Tonight?

MRS. SILK
It's better this way. For me,
anyway...

COLEMAN

I never knew him. Not really. I
didn't have any idea what he went
through. Every...

(on the verge of

saying "godamned"

but checks himself

in front of his

mother)
...Single day...
52 CONTINUED:

53.

52

MRS. SILK
I don't believe he wanted you to
know, dear. He couldn't see the
point.

COLEMAN
I can see the point. The point is
if you're Colored it doesn't
matter how much you know, you work
in the dining car. That's the
point.

MRS. SILK
Coleman, if it's your education,
you don't have to worry. Your
father's insurance and your own
academic record will see to it
that you get into Howard.

COLEMAN
Mom, Howard isn't ‘a real
university. Howard's no different
from East Orange.

MRS. SILK
(sharp)
Coleman!

COLEMAN

(he must make himself

heard, despite the

cost)
I heard all about Howard from
Walt. He said they're always
talking about "the negro people."
About "We the negro people." Mom,
I'm not a "political" person. I
don't know who this "we" is.

MRS. SILK
Your father wanted you to know who
you were; to be proud of your race.

COLEMAN
(with passion)
What about me?! What about just
being proud of being me? I don't
want to be part of some group. I
don't want to be "a Howard Negro."

MRS. SILK
Coleman, your father wanted the
best for you. He--
54.

52 CONTINUED: (2) 52

COLEMAN

And what about what I want?! It's
my life! Don't I get any say in
the matter?

(softening his tone)
Mom, I just want a chance to be
the best I can be. Why is that so
wrong?

MRS. SILK
I'm ‘not clever enough to argue
with you, Coleman...

COLEMAN
(he puts an arm
around her)
Then don't. Don't let's argue.
I love you, Mom, but don't ask me
to go there...

MRS. SILK
Coleman... you're barely eighteen;
what're you going to do?

53 INT. FEDERAL BUILDING, NAVAL RECRUITING OFFICE - DAY 53

Scores of YOUNG MEN filling out forms. PAN THE ROOM TO REVEAL
A large CALENDAR with the date - October 6, 1944 and several
propaganda POSTERS which inform us that "There's still a war
to be won" in the Pacific, "One down, One to Go" etc.
DISCOVER COLEMAN staring at his application form.

HIS POV: on the query demanding his age and date of birth.
Coleman fills out the data, then looks over to -

PAN TO THE NEXT QUESTION: RACE
The form offers WHITE, NEGRO, ORIENTAL, OTHER
Coleman stares at the boxes - WHITE... NEGRO...

Instinctively he looks around the room before returning his
scrutiny to the categories. Then:

CLOSE ON HIS PENCIL MAKING THE MARK IN THE BOX MARKED
WHITE.

WIDER ANGLE--as Coleman hands the form to the NAVY RECRUITER,
a young man (white) in a crisp white uniform. He studies the
form, looks up at Coleman.

CLOSE ON COLEMAN--certain that he has been found out.

Welcome to the Navy, young man.
INT. NATHAN'S CABIN, BERKSHIRES - NIGHT 54
NATHAN, who looks up from the letter, which he has just read.

NATHAN
So what did the lawyer say?

Coleman, still dressed as at Primus', paces, irritated,
confused -

COLEMAN
He wouldn't even discuss the
letter, he just... Well, he ~

NATHAN
(not really a
guestion)
Was more worried about Lester
Farley?
COLEMAN .
I don't want to talk about Lester
Farley..!
NATHAN

(hands him the glass)
What DO you want to talk about?
You show up here, all in a lather -

Silence, as Coleman struggles with his emotions.
Nathan studies him, then, softly -

NATHAN
(continuing)
Listen, I was at the post office
this morning, I heard people
saying you got Faunia Farley
pregnant, that she had an abortion
and tried to kill herself--

COLEMAN
(cutting him off)
Did they add she's an opium eater,
while they were at it? And don't
forget the best part, she's an
"illiterate woman"!
56.

54 CONTINUED: 54

NATHAN
Coleman, I know it's bullshit, I'm
your friend, remember ~-?

Coleman bangs down the glass of ice tea -

COLEMAN
Then act like it.

NATHAN
Coleman, don't take these people
on.
(gesturing toward the
television where the
impeachment hearings
are playing)
They're all crazy to blame, crazy
to punish-

COLEMAN
So I just throw her to the wolves?
(Realizes)
She's waiting for that. To her,
sex and betrayal are as basic as
bread.

NATHAN
I'm not thinking about her. I'm
thinking about you.

But Coleman is cranking up...

COLEMAN

Christ, my own kids - I never
allowed any of them to watch TV
and they manifest the mentality of
a soap opera. The best schools,
superior SAT scores, post graduate
degrees and where their father's
concerned, Jerry Springer is the
best they can do -?? Don't be

like them.
NATHAN
(helpless)
I don't know what you want me to
Say...
COLEMAN

I want you to acknowledge that
something important is taking
place between me and this woman -
something worthy of respect.
Don't judge me.
57.

54 CONTINUED: (2) 54

55

COLEMAN (cont'd)
And for heavens sake don't judge
her.

Nathan is flummoxed, having trouble following...

NATHAN
She's - what are you telling me?
She's the love of your life?

COLEMAN
Okay, look, granted, she's not my
first love and granted, she's not
my Great Love, okay? But she's
sure as hell my Last Love. Isn't
that worth something? Isn't it?

And he opens the door and walks out into the night

NATHAN'S VOICE OVER
And with my failure to reach him,
all the doors but one had been
slammed in Coleman's face.

INT. COLEMAN SILK'S BEDROOM, ATHENA - NIGHT 55

Coleman and Faunia together after making love, listening to
"The Man I Love"... she's smoking...

COLEMAN
Dance for me.
(her look)
Dance.

Undismayed and naked, Faunia stubs out the cigarette, gets
out of bed and undulates to sultry Gershwin.

COLEMAN
This is more than sex.

FAUNIA
No, it's not... You just forgot
what sex is. Don't fuck it up by
pretending it's something else.

STAY with Coleman, watching, not a depleted old man, but a
lover... Faunia's performance darkly reflected in an antique
oval MIRROR above the head of the bed just over Coleman...
She dances.

He watches. A connection between them... Faunia is not self
conscious.
58.

55 CONTINUED: 55

Her movements are small, not dancing really, rather
rhythmically exhibiting herself in tiny gestures for him...
Then in a series of slow dissolves as THE CAMERA MOVES IN ON
HER:

FAUNIA
(continuing)
Don't fall in love with me.

COLEMAN
Keep dancing...
FAUNIA
(dancing)
You're falling in love... Look at

you, Coleman, you're a little boy

in love with his piano teacher.

You're much too young for me.
(she smiles)

I need a much older man. At least

a hundred. You know anyone in a

wheelchair?

COLEMAN
Don't stop.

FAUNIA
I can't stop...

COLEMAN
This is all there is.

FAUNIA
Now you're talking. Stay angry.
Angry brings us together. Lemme
tell you, pal, you picked the
right dancing girl...

COLEMAN
You're wiser than your years...

FAUNIA
I'm dumber than my years. Being
stupid, that's my achievement.
Turns out I've been watching you
dance. I know all about you,
Coleman.

COLEMAN
That a fact?

She's dancing closer to him now, her body glistening -
55

FAUNIA
You imagine you've kept secrets
from me?
COLEMAN

You never know...

FAUNIA
What could there possibly be I
don't know about you by now..?

INT. MOVIE THEATRE - NIGHT 56

CLOSE ON a beautiful young girl (STEENA); she is blond and
cannot be more than nineteen. Hers is the FACE we saw in the
PHOTO with Coleman earlier. Just now she's alone-

ED HERLIHY'S VOICE
The war is over and hundreds of
thousands of American soldiers,

REVERSE ON THE NEWSREEL she's watching -

ED HERLIHY
sailors and airmen are returning
to a grateful nation where, thanks
to Uncle Sam, a college education
awaits, courtesy of the GI Bill..!

As the newsreel about the GI bill continues, We CUT TO:

COLEMAN SILK, now 21 wearing a tweed jacket and looking very
collegiate. He sits several rows behind Steena; his eyes
fixed on her. Then, just as he is about to make a move toward
her, three young women crowd in on either side of Steena and
they all begin whispering and giggling among themselves.
Reluctantly, Coleman gets to his feet and starts up the aisle
of the theater, throwing one last look over his shoulder,
towards the girl as he does.

INT. STACKS, NYU LIBRARY - DAY 57

ON COLEMAN--He moves through the stacks, carrying a couple of
books; clearly searching for another. He pauses, about to
remove a book from the shelf when he looks O.S.:

HIS POV: In the distance we get a glimpse of the beautiful
blond girl we saw in the movie theater. She instantly
disappears; and for a moment Coleman isn't sure whether what
he saw was real or an apparition.

CLOSER ON COLEMAN (TRACKING WITH HIM)--he instantly starts in
hot pursuit of the girl.
60.

57 CONTINUED: 57

58

As he reaches the end of the row; he stops, looks around.

HIS POV--At first there is no sign of the blond. Then he
spots her disappearing into another row of books.

ON COLEMAN (AGAIN TRACKING WITH HIM) as he ducks into another
row of books, moving parallel with her, intending to head her
off.

COLEMAN'S POV (TRACKING SHOT): looking though the shelves we
get a glimpse: of the blond several rows away. Once again she
disappears.

ON COLEMAN--brushing past a browser in the stacks.

COLEMAN
Excuse me...

Throughout this we are continually CROSS-CUTTING BETWEEN
COLEMAN, AND HIS POV OF THE GIRL (never getting more than
glimpses of her).

ON COLEMAN as he rounds a corner and stops dead in his tracks:

HIS POV: There is the blond, she stands not far away, her
back to him, still intent on the book she is reading.

TIGHT ON COLEMAN--There is a half smile on his lips; the same
half smile we saw in the boxing ring.

TIGHTER ON THE BLOND--Her back is still to us.

COLEMAN'S VOICE OVER
Hi...

As she turns TO CAMERA we see her for the first time and
realize that she really is that beautiful.

INT. COLEMAN'S GREENWICH VILLAGE APT. - DAY 58

ON THE DOOR--as it is unlocked and Coleman brings the blond
in...

BLOND
I really shouldn't -

COLEMAN
One cup of coffee, that's all. I
promise. Library stays open til
five...

As he leads her inside we see his apartment for the first
time. It is an attractive one room apartment with a simple
fireplace and a kitchenette off to one side.
61.

58 CONTINUED: 58

The walls are white, there are reproductions of Paul Klee and
Chagall. The bookshelves are one by eights with bricks at
each end serving as risers. There are books everywhere, on
every surface; on the table we see a pair of boxing gloves
(not the kind you use in the ring, but lighter ones, the kind
fighters use for work on the heavy bag). The bed has been
carefully made, dishes put away; the impression we get is one
of order and neatness.

STEENA
GI bill pays for all this..?

ON COLEMAN--as he begins fixing coffee.
COLEMAN

How do you take it. I'm sorry,
say your name again..? Steena -?

 

BLOND
Steena Palsson... black is fine...
How'd you get that cut over your
eye?
COLEMAN
Steena... What is that, Swedish?
STEENA
Close. Norwegian. I really
should-
COLEMAN

You're not from New York...

STEENA
(embarrassed smile)
How could you tell? Fergus Falls,
Minnesota.

He walks over to her, smiling -

COLEMAN
You're making that up, right?
STEENA
No, I -
He's standing so close, she's desperate for a diversion- sees
something...
STEENA
(continuing)

You weren't kidding... that cut...

She picks up his BOXING GLOVES -
62.

58 CONTINUED: (2) 58

COLEMAN

It's just a hobby. Ever tried?
STEENA

Me? Are you -
COLEMAN

Here... very therapeutic...
STEENA

I dunno...
COLEMAN

(holding up his
hands, palms out)
C'mon, try it. Live a little.

STEENA
Coleman -

COLEMAN

Don't be afraid. Now -

(he helps her adjust

her arms)
Right handed? Okay, you use your
right to punch, but you keep your
left up, like so...

(he gently positions

her left hand beside

her face)
..this protects you. Now you jab
with your right. Try a few jabs.

She does; aiming at his open palms.

COLEMAN
(continuing)
That's it...Now, use your feet,
dance with me.

She continues to throw jabs, relaxing, laughing.

COLEMAN
(continuing)
Are you smart - ?

STEENA
(breathless)
Smart - ?

He easily takes hold of both her hands in his; now he is very
close to her.
63.

58 CONTINUED: (3) 58

COLEMAN
Boxing is really all about how
smart you are...

He leans forward, kissing her lightly. Then again. Then
again, this time she moves toward the kiss.

STEENA
(sudden thought)
Do you do this a lot..?

COLEMAN
(smiles reassuringly)
Practice makes perfect.

He's kissing her again.
DISSOLVE TO:
59 INT. COLEMAN'S APARTMENT - LATER 59

The GLOVES on the floor, RISE UP TO REVEAL the two of them
lying in bed together. She's stunned.

STEENA
I can't believe this.

Coleman grins -

STEENA
(continuing)
I mean I can't believe I did
something like this...

COLEMAN
Waiting for lightning to strike
you dead..?

STEENA
Well... Where I come from -

COLEMAN
Fergus Falls, Minnesota...

STEENA
People don't just hop into -

COLEMAN
Let me guess. First there's
eyeing one another in church on
Sundays...
59 CONTINUED:

64.

COLEMAN (cont'd)
then, as fall slips into winter
and the air turns cold, there's
sleigh rides, skating on frozen
lakes, singing Carols around the
Yuletide-

STEENA
Very funny...

COLEMAN
Go on then, give me the straight
dope. Tell me about real American
courtship...

STEENA
(startled)
You're American. Jews are American.

He's kissing her again - and again she's succumbing -

60 EXT. STREET - DAY 60

ON COLEMAN AND STEENA--as they round the corner of a street

near NYU.

THE CAMERA MOVES WITH STEENA AND COLEMAN as they

walk, their arms around one another.

STEENA
So all I'm saying is that Achilles
is the first real individual in
all of western litera--

COLEMAN

(shakes his head)
Not a chance...

(grins)
Look, Achilles succumbed to to
group pressure, right? I mean, he
gave up the girl - a girl he
really wanted - so the Greeks
could keep going with the Trojan
war. He gave in to group pressure.

STEENA
From which you conclude what -
that groups are -?

COLEMAN
How tall are you?

STEENA
Is this the same conversation?
60 CONTINUED:

65.

60
COLEMAN
I'd say you were maybe five, ten,
right?
STEENA
Where is this le-
COLEMAN
Did you play basketball in high
school?
STEENA
Sure...
COLEMAN
And I bet you were good.
STEENA
Well, I -
COLEMAN

But let me ask you this. Did you
want to play?

STEENA
Did I -?

COLEMAN
In America, if you're a girl and
you're five ten they make you play
basketball. It's a given. They
don't ask if you want to play, if
you're interested in the game.
Height equals fate. You play.
You do what the group says.

STEENA
I like basketball...

COLEMAN
What if it were something you
didn't like? Say all girls over
five ten had to shave their heads.

They are both laughing, Steena turns and looks at Coleman
with a look of total adoration

STEENA
Oh, God, Coleman... I think I'm in
love with you.

At that moment we HEAR a click. The picture freezes and turns
to black and white. It is the snapshot Nathan Zuckerman saw
in Coleman's house earlier.
60

66.

CONTINUED: (2) 60

ON A STREET PHOTOGRAPHER--He has just taken the photograph we
saw earlier in the scene with Nathan. The one Coleman has
kept all these years and now we know why.

STREET PHOTOGRAPHER
(handing Coleman a
card)
Picture of you and your sweetheart
for a dollar?

As Coleman happily digs in his pocket we HEAR: Dick Haymes
singing "Our Love Is Here To Stay."

INT. RECORD STORE - DAY 61

It is in the days when LPs and 45s first came out; there are
bins filled with hit singles. Dick Haymes continues to sing
as we see Steena and Coleman in a listening booth. Coleman
comes out to look for another record as Steena remains in the
booth continuing to listen to a record. THE CAMERA PANS AHEAD
OF HIM TO REVEAL a very pretty young salesgirl, she is a
coffee colored African American. Her name is ELLIE and she
watches Coleman with interest. We move with her as she
crosses to a bin where Coleman is flipping through 78s.

ELLIE
Can I help you?

COLEMAN
(glancing up)
I was...looking for Edith Piaf,
"La Vie un Rose."

ELLIE
This way..

THE CAMERA MOVES WITH THEM--she walks very close to him so
that they brush against one another.

ELLIE
(continuing; innocent)
Have you heard the new Louis
Armstrong?

COLEMAN
No, I'm not--

ELLIE
(amused)
What about "Black and Tan Suite?"
It's the best thing Ellington's
done in--
67.

61 CONTINUED: 61

COLEMAN
I'm sorry, I'm really not--

ELLIE
(nodding O.S.)
That your girlfriend?

HER POV: Steena in the booth, moving gently in time to the

music.
COLEMAN
Yeah.
ELLIE
(flirting)
Here...

(she hands him a 78

record)
Take this, Roy Eldridge, "The Man
I Love." This'1ll do the job a hell
of a lot better than Edith Piaf.

We HEAR ~- THE MAN I LOVE.
62 INT. COLEMAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 62

CLOSE ON COLEMAN AND STEENA--in a passionate embrace, as they
come up for air. Although "The Man I Love" continues to play;
we are close enough to Coleman and Steena to be aware of
their breathing.

COLEMAN
(a whisper)
Dance for me...

CLOSER ON STEENA--She steps away, looking Coleman in the eye
for a long, long beat as she comes to a decision. Then, with
the arest trace of a smile, she removes first one earring and
then the other.

She begins a languid, undulating motion as she takes
Coleman's hand, opens it and drops the two earrings into his
palm. Then, continuing the slow rhythmic movements begins to
undress slowly.

This should be a very different Steena from the girl who
first walked into Coleman's apartment; some deep, erotic part
of her has been unlocked and at moments she displays a way of
moving that is uncannily like Faunia's. In a series of SLOW
DISSOLVES we watch as she strips to the sensual music of
Gershwin.
62

63

68.

CONTINUED: 62

By the end, when she has removed her last undergarment and
dances in front of Coleman absolutely naked, the record comes
to an end and we hear the scratching of the needle of the
record player on vinyl. It is as though at that moment she
comes out of a trance. She immediately puts her hands to her
face to cover her embarrasment.

REVERSE ON COLEMAN

COLEMAN
(continuing)
That has got to be the single most
sexy dance ever to be danced by a
girl from Fergus Falls in the
history of the world.

ON STEENA--her hands remain covering her face; both mortally
embarrassed and profoundly exhilarated.

STEENA
Oh, God, Coleman, I love you. I
want to spend my life with you.

COLEMAN
What are you doing Sunday?

CLOSER ON STEENA--She lowers her hands from her face.

STEENA
(in answer to the
question we heard
the older Coleman
ask)
Sunday? Nothing. Why?

REVERSE ON THE YOUNGER COLEMAN

COLEMAN
On Sunday we're taking the train
to New Jersey...
{a beat)
To have dinner with my mother.

EXT. CENTRAL AVENUE, EAST ORANGE, NEW JERSEY - DUSK 63

Coleman and Steena walk towards his house. Steena is carrying
FLOWERS. Coleman points out various landmarks.

COLEMAN
...that's where I crashed my bike
into old man Harris' front
porch... My dad made me pay--

Just then we HEAR:
63

65

69.

CONTINUED: 63

A MAN'S VOICE
(calling out)
Coleman.

Coleman looks 0.S. waves.

THEIR POV: Across the street a young man (African American),
a few years older than Coleman waves.

ON COLEMAN AND STEENA--Coleman waves back, then quickly
glances in Steena's direction to see her reaction.

EXT. THE SILK FAMILY HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER 64

ON COLEMAN AND STEENA--His arm is around her, he leans
forward, presses the bell and turns to Steena.

COLEMAN
(very nervous)
I love you, you know that don't
you?

Before she can answer the door opens and there is Mrs. Silk,
her hair is grayer, but otherwise she looks the same.

MRS. SILK
Well, isn't this lovely.
(she kisses her son,
then to Steena)
Hello, you must be Steena...Please
Come in...

TIGHT ON STEENA--She has been brought up very well and,
although her world has just collapsed around her, her manners
are impeccable.

STEENA
I brought you these...

MRS. SILK
Aren't they beautiful? I'll just
put them in water...

She leads them in as the DOOR closes on us.

INT. SILK DINING ROOM, NJ. - NIGHT 65
Coleman, his mother and Steena at dinner - the dining room
looks a little empty with only three... As she speaks, Steena
seems to be breathing in all the wrong places...

Mrs. Silk is wise enough to understand what her son has not

told Steena; therefore she does everything in her power to
make this poor girl more comfortable.
65

66

70.

CONTINUED: 65

STEENA
.»..it's a beautiful city, Fergus
Falls, unusual because it has the
Otter Tail Lake just to the
East... My father has a hardware
supply store and a small
lumberyard ~ he's the disorganized
one, cuts himself and doesn't even
bother to wash it; they're tough,
those Icelanders - I didn't even
know they were called Icelanders.
My mother, she's a Rasmussen -
she's the opposite: sets the table
for Saturday dinner at five the
night before. I guess I was
caught between the two extremes,
so I decided to get away for
college, you know, out of their
reach, and...that's how I came to
New York...

A caesura in her breathless delivery... Steena looking
pathetically around, then -

MRS. SILK
I've never been to the mid-west
but I'm sure I'd like it.
Coleman, wouldn't you like to see
the mid west? Steena, would you
like another biscuit?

Steena's look of gratitude.

STEENA
Thank you. Thank you so much.

INT. PENNSYLVANIA RR TRAIN - NIGHT 66

Coleman and Steena, virtually alone in the chair car, heading
back for the city. Steena leans against the window, silent,
staring out into the night. Coleman sits next to her,
watching her carefully, holding her hand.

COLEMAN
Steena?

Silence, then with the screeching of brakes the train pulls
to a stop. The conductor (black) walks through the car,
announcing Penn Station, the final stop. The people get up
and leave the car, still Steena doesn't move.

COLEMAN
(continuing)
Honey...?
71.

66 CONTINUED: 66

67

CLOSE ON STEENA--as she turns to Coleman, we see for the
first time that she has been crying. She looks at him for a
long beat, just shaking her head.

STEENA

I'm sorry. Coleman, I...I love you
but--

(she breaks off)
I can't. I'm really sorry, but...

(shaking her head)
I just...can't...I'm sorry...I'm
sorry...

And without another word, blind with tears, she flees.
Coleman doesn't go after her. He just sits there. Alone.

As we FADE TO BLACK we hear the roar of a crowd.
INT. ST. NICHOLAS ARENA - NIGHT 67

WIDE SHOT--of the crows, still relatively sparse since it is
the first or decond match of the evening. THE CAMERA PANS
ACROSS TO THE RING where an AFRICAN AMERICAN BOXER waits,
bouncing up and down, throwing punches at the air,

REVERSE ON THE YOUNG COLEMAN as he climbs through the ropes
along with his CORNERMAN who is African- American. SOLLY, a
small time fight promoter who manages Coleman, climbs up
leans in and whispers to Coleman.

SOLLY
Hey, Silky...Take it easy with the
nigger, okay? Let's give the
people their money's worth.

Coleman stares 0.S. at the fighter, his face a mask.

SOLLY
(continuing; smiling)
Dance him around for three, four
rounds, then go to work.

The bell sounds, Coleman moves into the ring more rapidly
than usual. The formalities over, the men begin to feel one
another out. We notice that the usual smile is gone from
Coleman's face; it has been replaced by a look of grim
determination.

After one or two punches, Coleman nails his opponent with a
right cross and then methodically begins to pound the black
fighter, knocking him out before the round is half way over.
There are boos from the crowd.
72.

68 INT. COLEMAN'S READY ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 68

Coleman's African American cornerman stripping off his
gloves, gear, as Solly returns, studies Coleman, who doesn't
look up-

SOLLY
I ask you nicely to give folks
their money's worth. You could
have stopped the nigger in the
fourth round instead of the first.

COLEMAN

(doesn't look up)
I'm a hundred thirty-nine pounds,
five foot nine and this guy's one
forty-five, five foot eleven. I'm
supposed to let him hit me in the
head five, ten extra times to put
on a show?

(looks up)
I ain't holding up no nigger.

The cornerman doesn't react ~
69 INT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT 69
It is a nightclub in the Village, late at night. Coleman is

dancing with ELLIE (the pretty girl from the record store).
The music is slow and they are dancing very close together.

ELLIE

What are you anyway, Coleman Silk?
COLEMAN

What am I? Play it anyway you like.
ELLIE

So white girls thinks you're white?
COLEMAN

Whatever they think, I let them

think.
ELLIE

And what about your family, do
they know about this?

COLEMAN
I don't see what good it would do
to tell them.

ELLIE
And me? What about me?
73.

69 CONTINUED: 69

COLEMAN
A guy from school saw us the other
day and said, "What's it like with
a colored girl." And I told him,
"Man, they are completely hot."

Ellie laughs, moves even closer to him.

ELLIE
(a whisper)
Then let's let them know how right
you were.

She leans up and kisses him; he kisses her back.
INT. COLEMAN'S APARTMENT ~ NIGHT 70
The room is dark. HOLD FOR A BEAT then:

ELLIE'S VOICE
Coleman?

COLEMAN'S VOICE OVER
You think what I'm doing is wrong?

ON COLEMAN--He stands at a window, looking out into the night.
ON ELLIE--as she reaches across, turns on a bedside lamp.

ELLIE
(reaching for a
cigarette)
Passing?

CLOSER ON COLEMAN~-as he turns to her.

COLEMAN
But that's just it. I don't tell
people I'm white; I don't tell
them I'm Jewish. Oh, I know it's
passing in one sense, but it's not
because I want to be white. It
isn't. I don't want to be white.

ELLIE
(weary)
Well, honey, you sure don't want
to be colored.
(then: )
What happened with your girlfriend?

COLEMAN
We broke up.

CONTINUED: 70

ELLIE
Did she know you were passing?

Silence.

ELLIE
(continuing)
Did you ever tell her you were
paying for your Ph.D in a boxing
ring?

Silence.

ELLIE
(continuing)
How come?

Nothing.

ELLIE

(continuing; with a

sigh)
I'm starting to think you're
right. This isn't about you being
colored or white. Coleman Silk,
I'm starting to think this is
about you being the kind of man
who just loves having secrets.

EXT. NYU CAMPUS & GREENWICH VILLAGE ST. 1951 - DAY 71

A rally to save the Rosenbergs from execution. IRIS GITTELMAN
(20's), waving a PLACARD and awkwardly offering a PETITION.
Attractive, she's dressed in earth tones and Navajo jewelry.
We recognize her at once because of her flamboyant hair...

IRIS
Save the Rosenbergs! Sign now!
There's no time to lose! Save the
Rosenbergs! Hey, buddy -! Justice-

She literally yanks the guy around to face her. It's Coleman.
He wears a smart tie with his tweed jacket and, as always,
packs BOOKS - which now go flying...

Iris is doubly startled - and flustered. Coleman is movie
star handsome. He crackles with sexual electricity.

IRIS
(continuing)
Hey, sorry...

Embarrassed by his great looks, she clumsily ditches her
placard, clunking him on the head with it - Oy!
71

72

75.

CONTINUED: 71

As she squats to help him retrieve the volumes, she's
blushing-

IRIS
(continuing)
So, you gonna sign the petition..?

COLEMAN
(picking up books)
I'm not really a political person -

IRIS
What's that mean? You'll potchke
in front of a blackboard while the
Rosenbergs get the chair?

COLEMAN
(amused)
I suppose you think Alger Hiss is
innocent, as well...
IRIS
Alger Hiss is as innocent as you
are!
FREEZE FRAME on Coleman's reaction: she thinks I'm innocent.
CLOSE ON A PHOTOGRAPH OF IRIS, featuring her fly away hair.
PULL BACK TO REVEAL;
INT. MRS. SILKS' PARLOR, EAST ORANGE, NJ - DAY 72

As Coleman's mother studies the photo. Coleman sits opposite
her.

MRS. SILK
Iris. Nice name. And when is the
happy day?
COLEMAN
June 14.
MRS. SILK
June 14. She's white, of course.
(pause)

Have you told her?

COLEMAN
-No.
76.

72 CONTINUED: 72
MRS. SILK
When will you?
(no reply)
You plan on bringing her here for
dinner?
COLEMAN
You saw what happened when I tried
that.

Their eyes lock. Mrs. Silks suddenly understands - pow.

COLEMAN
(continuing; quietly)
I told her my parents are dead.

MRS. SILK
Dead... that you have no brother,
you have no sister. There is no
Ernestine. There is no Walter.

COLEMAN
I don't want to be Coleman Silk,
the Negro classics professor - and
that's how it would always come
out, Mom. You know it and I know
it.

He speaks urgently, desperate for her to understand -

MRS. SILK
Funny, I never thought of you as
black or white. Gold. You were my
golden child...

COLEMAN
Mom, look, I haven't worked the
whole thing out, I'm just -

MRS. SILK
Will you have children?

COLEMAN
I suppose...

Mrs. Silk won't raise her voice -

MRS. SILK
You're never going to let them see
me, are you? My grandchildren?
Mom, you'll tell me, sit in the
waiting room in Penn Station at
11:25am. I'll walk by with my kids
in their Sunday best.
77.

72 CONTINUED: (2) 72

MRS. SILK (cont'd)
That'll be my birthday present
five years from now. And you know
I'll be there. The train station,
the zoo, Central Park - wherever
you say. Or maybe you can hire me
to come over as Mrs. Brown to baby
sit. I'll do it. Put them to bed
and clean your house. But aren't
you taking a risk having children?
The suspense will be unbearable.
Suppose they don't emerge from her
womb as white as you? Won't you
have some explaining to do? Will
you accuse her of adultery? With
a Negro? But she'll know that
isn't true...

She picks up Iris' photo and realizes -

MRS. SILK

(continuing)
Maybe it won't come to that. Look
at that hair. Coleman, you seem
to have thought of everything. If
they have hair like their
mother's, that will explain away
a lot, won't it? Are you marrying
her for her hair?

COLEMAN
(stiff)
Of course not.
(getting to his feet)
I have to go now, Mom...

MRS. SILK
You think like a prisoner,
Coleman. You're white as snow and
you think like a slave.

He bends down kiss her; she pulls her head away.

MRS. SILK
(continuing)
Murderer...

ON COLEMAN--He straightens up, turns and as THE CAMERA TRACKS
WITH HIM, walks from the parlor, through the living room and
into the front hallway. Just as he is about to open the front
door, he pauses, sensing something behind him as he turns we

waiter in a railroad car; his hands are clasped in front of
him. He stares straight at his son.

DISSOLVE TO:
INT. COLEMAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 73

CLOSE ON COLEMAN--He reads, or pretends he is reading. We
HOLD ON HIM as we HEAR: the angry noise of the buzzer from
the vestibule. Coleman's head turns at the sound, but he
doesn't move. A moment later Iris appears behind him, she is
wearing a loose fitting robe and is in the process of drying
her hair.

IRIS
Who could it be, this late?

Instantly Coleman is on his feet.

COLEMAN
I'll get it.
INT. HALLWAY JUST OUTSIDE COLEMAN'S APARTMENT - SAME 74

As Coleman steps outside.

HIS POV: Through the mesh grill we see a shadowy figure in
the vestibule.

ON THE DOOR as Coleman opens it to reveal Walter, older,
heavier and now wearing civilian clothes. Walter grabs
Coleman shoves him against the wall.

WALTER
Don't you ever come near Mom again.

COLEMAN
Walt, wait a--

WALTER
You don't call, you don't write,
you don't nothing!

He lets go of his brother, looks at him with utter contempt.

I never want to see your lily-

The screen is black. THE CAMERA PANS DOWN and we see the roof
of a brightly lit Chinese restaurant. THE CAMERA CONTINUES
IT'S MOVE and we see a scattering of cars in the parking lot.
As we watch a black van pulls to a stop in front of the
restaurant...

NATHAN'S VOICE OVER
Everything was prepared for what
was now inevitable.

One of the van doors opens and a man in his fifties (BOBCAT)
gets out.

NATHAN'S VOICE OVER

"kay? We're gone. Say the word.

LES
What word - ?

LOUIE
We'll have a code word. Say the

LES
Told you! Ain't going to see the

That's what they all say at first.
Les, I know, I been there. Look

Lester manages a nod.

LOUIE

‘kay we're all having Wonton. Now
we're gonna order the other stuff.
Les, you want chicken, vegetables,
pork? You want lo mein? Noodles -?

From the corner of his eye, Les sees a CHINESE WAITER begin
his approach - his eyes widen with hatred and fear...

LES
What the fuck -

LOUIE
Can you stay back please? Five
wonton soups! Just give us a

Sir, sir! Sir, if you just stay

Okay? Right. You stay there.
Perfect. Okay, Les?

You're doing real good. I remember
my first time. Thought I'd never
make it. Couldn't even open the
fucking menu...

LES
What's the fucking code word?

LOUIE
Tea leaf. Just say tea leaf and
we're out of here...

The waiter emerges from the kitchen with the soup. Instantly,
Chet and Swift head off the waiter and take the tray...

This almost over? Because I'm
tellin' you now I can't take much
more. I can't fucking take any

Over this we HEAR a pianist playing Prokofiev.
INT. CONCERT HALL, TANGLEWOOD ~ DAY 77

ON A PIANIST--wearing a sweater and jeans is playing
Prokofiev. Behind him we see a small chamber group also
casually dressed. The pianist stops almost mid-phrase as a
violinst comes over to him and the two men begin to discuss
the music in whispers. Over this we HEAR:

NATHAN'S VOICE OVER
I had been both missing Coleman
and missing the experience of
having an intimate friend,..

ON THE AUDIENCE--a handful of people, dressed as casually as
the performers are scattered around the concert hall used for
chamber groups. Behind them, through a large opening we can
see the Berkshires in the distance.

ON NATHAN--He appears at the side moving through rows of
empty seats (some of which have sweaters draped over the back
to mark them as occupied) looking for a chair. Meanwhile the
rehearsal begins again.

NATHAN'S VOICE OVER
(continuing)
...SO I drove to Tanglewood to
listen to a rehearsal of the
evening's performance.

CLOSER IN ON NATHAN-~-as he takes his seat and spots something
O.S.:

HIS POV: Coleman and Faunia are seated several rows ahead of
Nathan. We see Coleman lean across and whisper something to
Faunia. She smiles, but says nothing in response.

EXT. LAWN OUTSIDE THE CONCERT HALL - LATE 78
It is intermission, Coleman and Faunia are huddled together,
he is talking as she lights a cigarette. She is listening,
although it is obvious that she is very uncomfortable.

NATHAN (0.S.)
Coleman.

Coleman looks up, a flash of panic in his eyes.
84.

78 CONTINUED: 78

COLEMAN
(then smiling)
Nathan, I thought I saw you...
what a surprise...
(to Faunia)
You remember Nathan Zuckerman.

Coleman takes a gentle hold of Faunia's arm so that she will
not bolt this time.

FAUNIA
(neutral)
I remember.

COLEMAN
(stepping quickly in)
Mr. Bronfman's something isn't he?
I was telling Faunia that he took
ten years at least out of that
piano

CROSS-CUTTING BETWEEN THEM:

NATHAN
I was thinking along those lines
myself.
(a beat, then:)
I've missed you, Coleman. Maybe I
can take you two to dinner some
night.

COLEMAN
(once more a flicker
of panic)
Good idea. Yes. Let's do that.
The Intermission BELL RINGS. Coleman tries to hide relief.
COLEMAN
(continuing)
Uh oh, we've got to run.
He's pulling Faunia away but Nathan can't help himself.

NATHAN
Coleman!

COLEMAN
I'll call you!

As he hurries her away into the crowd we HEAR:

CONTINUED: (2) 78

NATHAN'S VOICE OVER
I tried to use my imagination -
not to speculate where they went.
That wasn't hard. But rather to
ponder what their mutual rage had
made of them: outcasts, alone
together, they were now stripped
down to the simplest version of
themselves. With nothing between
them and their destiny.

INT. BEDROOM, COLEMAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT 719
CLOSE ON FAUNIA-~-as she leans over, kisses Coleman.

FAUNIA
I have to go.

COLEMAN
Stay here tonight.

She shakes her head, smiles...

FAUNIA
How many times do I have to tell
you...
(kissing him again)
I never stay the night.

Although she has said this many times, her heart isn't in it

COLEMAN
(leaning forward to
kiss her gently)
Just this once.

We FADE TO BLACK:
INT. COLEMAN'S KITCHEN - NEXT MORNING 80

ON COLEMAN--He sits at the kitchen table, reading the New
York Times. A cup of coffee is in front of him and laid out
on the table is an elegant breakfast: orange juice, toast in
a silver toast rack, eggs benedict (in a covered plate to
keep them warm). He looks up, smiles.

COLEMAN
(cheerfully)
Good morning.

REVERSE ON FAUNIA--She stands in the doorway, wearing
sweatpants and a worn tee shirt.
86.

80 CONTINUED: 80

COLEMAN
(continuing)
Sit down, your eggs will get cold.

Faunia sits; she has the look of an animal whose instincts
sense a trap.

COLEMAN
(continuing; making
conversation)
Doesn't look like Monica is going
to find a job in New York any time
soon.

Faunia stares at the plate in front of her -
HER POV - beautifully prepared eggs benedict... Coleman reads-
COLEMAN

(continuing)
"According to Vernon Jordan--

FAUNIA
Can't you avoid the fucking
seminar?

COLEMAN

(looks up at her)
I was only -

Faunia hurls her cup of coffee across the room, shattering it
and its contents against the cabinets -

FAUNIA
I don't give a fuck that poor
Monica can't find a job! Does
fucking Monica worry if my back
hurts from milking those fucking
cows? Does she worry about me
sweeping up people's shit at the
fucking post office? You think
losing your job when you're about
to retire anyway is a big deal,
it's not, I hate to-tell you.
Having your step-father put his
fingers in your cunt, that's a big
deal; a husband who comes up
behind you with an iron pipe and
hits you in the head that's a big
deal...having two kids suffocating
and dying, that's a big deal!
87.

80 CONTINUED: (2) 80

83

84

FAUNIA (cont'd)

(tears starting)
Shit...

(looking around like

a trapped animal)
Why did I fucking stay?! It was a
mistake. Even fucking whores know
better: "Men don't pay you to
sleep with them. They pay you to
go home."

And she runs out of the house and leaving him alone.
EXT. ROAD - LATE 81

The same twisting two lane we saw at the start. Faunia's
Chevy squealing around curves...

The Chevy passes the SIGN at the head of a dirt road: AUDUBON
SOCIETY - where Coleman first gave her a lift. Her big car
squeals to a STOP out of FRAME.

INT. FAUNIA'S CHEVY - DAY 82
Faunia leaning on the wheel, thinking. Crying.

EXT. AUDUBON SOCIETY BUILDING - DAY . 83
A gray-shingled two story house nestled in the woods. WIND

CHIMES. Once a residence, now the start of trails into the
bird sanctuary...

Faunia's Chevy bumps uncertainly into the parking area and
stops. Faunia gets out, walks to the door.

INT. AUDUBON SOCIETY BUILDING ~-DAY 84

CLOSE ON A CAGE with a crow (PRINCE) inside; he moves back
and forth in an excited manner.

FAUNIA'S VOICE
Hi Prince...

THE CAMERA WIDENS IT'S ANGLE--and we see Faunia approaching
the cage and the bird getting as close to her as it can.

FAUNIA
(softly)
How are you doing my Prince?

ON A DOOR LEADING TO THE OFFICE--inside a young girl is
feeding an animal; she sees Faunia, who is obviously a
regular visitor.
88.

84 CONTINUED: 84

GIRL
Oh, hi.
(nodding toward the
cage)
He got out the other day.

CROSS-CUTTING BETWEEN THEM:

FAUNIA
But he always comes back, don't
you, boy? Can I have him on my
shoulder? Honey, it's Faunia...

The Bird watches her from within its cage.

GIRL
You can try, but he won't come out
of his cage if he thinks you want
him to -

Faunia opens the cage and holds out her hand, but Prince
won't budge -

FAUNIA

Oh, I know all his little tricks,
don't I, Prince?

(over her shoulder)
He was famous in Seely Falls when
I lived there, used to go for all
the bright objects in the parking
lot, barrettes in the girls' hair,
keys and tin foil. The newspaper
wrote him up... all about the
folks who raised him after the
nest was destroyed...one.

GIRL
Yeah, we used to have the article
on the bulletin board, but he
pecked it all to pieces...

FAUNIA
(laughs)
He tore up his clippings? Ashamed
of your background? Didn't want
anyone to know about your past?
Oh, you good boy, you good crow...

GIRL
He was flying around outside like
I said, but the other crows
started attacking him - they
would've killed him. He doesn't
have the right voice.
89.

84 CONTINUED: (2) 84

FAUNIA
It's from being hand raised...
(stroking the bird's
breast)
Hanging around all his life with
people like us. The human stain...

Suddenly Prince erupts in his own strange CAW -

GIRL
See, he imitates the school kids
who come here, but it's not the
crow language and they catch on.
Prince is a crow that doesn't know
how to be a crow. Careful, he
bites.

TIGHT ON PRINCE

FAUNIA (0O.S.)
Oh, I know. Listen, he's humming!
Listen, children... oh, children...

CLOSE ON FAUNIA--to THE CAMERA:

FAUNIA
The first time I tried was a month
after they died...Oh, I was
ecstatic, getting myself ready,
that first time...I tried so
hard... I was so happy. I remember
the gin and the valium and the rat
poison. It tasted bitter so I
folded it into the butterscotch
pudding... I was so happy... Why
did they break down the door? I
still don't know who did that, who
ruined it... The second time my
heart wasn't in it. It was just
impulse and I slashed.

TIGHT ON THE BIRD--watching her.

FAUNIA (V.O.)
You remember, don't you, boy...

ON FAUNIA--leaning close to the cage, whispering to the bird.

FAUNIA
This morning I made a mistake.
(she takes a last
look)
Farewell, my Prince.
90.

85 EXT. SHOPPING MALL, PITTSFIELD MA. - DAY 85

ESTABLISHING SHOT--The travelling wall (a reproduction of the
Vietnam Memorial in Washington) has been set up outside a
shopping mall in Pittsfield. There are a number people
(family members along with Veterans)seaching for the names of
comrades or relatives who were killed in action. In spite of
the fact that it is a large crowd it is more quiet than you
would expect as people move about, talking quietly among
themselves... From the distance we héar a speaker.

SPEAKER
The people whose names are
inscribed on this wall are your
relatives, friends and neighbors.

As the speaker continues we CUT TO:

CLOSE ON THE WALL (TRACKING SHOT)--Row upon row of the names
of the dead.

ON LES, BOBCAT AND LOUIE (TRACKING WITH THEM)

LOUIE
What's Kenny's last name?

Nothing. Les is mesmerized by the wall.

LES
Les?

LES
(continuing)
Peterson. Kenneth Peterson...

What FOLLOWS is a MONTAGE as we see couples, their arms
around one another looking at the wall. A child placing a
small boquet of flowers by the wall. A man about fifty,
kneeling beside the wall his hand resting against the wall as
though it held some magical power. And all the time we
continually CROSS-CUT TIGHTER AND TIGHTER ON THE NAMES.
TIGHTER AND TIGHTER ON LESTER FARLEY. Finally THE CAMERA
COMES TO REST ON KENNETH BRIGGS.

LOUIE
(nodding 0O.S.)
He's right over there, Les.

Lester Farley doesn't move.

LOUIE
(continuing; quietly)
Kenny's right over there; he's
waiting for you.
85

86

91.

CONTINUED: 85

Finally Les crosses to the wall, stands in front of Kenny's
name for a long beat, then drops to his knees.

JUMP CUT IN TIGHT ON LES as he touches the letters a spasm of
pain crosses his face; then he leans forward and kisses the
name.

ON LOUIE AND BOBCAT--deeply moved.

LOUIE
(continuing)
I told you the Wall would work.
He's gonna' be okay.
(tears in his eyes)
Les is gonna' be okay, now...

INT. COLEMAN'S KITCHEN - NIGHT 86
Coleman enters and reacts -
Faunia is there. She's cleaned the whole place, putting away

saucepans and wiping off the coffee-stained cupboard from the
morning's debacle.

COLEMAN
Hi...
FAUNIA
Hi... Custodial Staff... Just

doing my thing...
He says nothing.

FAUNIA
(continuing)
Where were you?

COLEMAN
I went to the movies.

Another pause.

FAUNIA
I'm sorry. For what I did. For
what I said.

COLEMAN
You were right. What happened to
me is nothing.

FAUNIA
They took away everything you had,
everything you did - all over one
stupid word... That isn't nothing.
92.

86 CONTINUED: 86

87

FAUNIA (cont'd)
Anyways, I don't think you can
measure sorrow...

They've drifted towards one another; she's in his arms. They
stand in the middle of the kitchen, holding one another.

VERY CLOSE IN: Coleman's head rests against Faunia.

COLEMAN
(a whisper)
Can you keep a secret?...

She pulls away, takes his head between her hands,

FAUNIA
Later.

As she kisses him we DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. ROAD - DAWN 87

ON THE PICK-UP TRUCK--It is parked by the side of the road,
the lights are off; it sits silent and ominous in the gray
light just before dawn. Over this we HEAR:

LES' VOICE
(exhausted)
Numb. Fuckin' numb. No emotions.

As Lester Farley continues THE CAMERA SLOWLY MOVES IN ON THE
TRUCK.

LES' VOICE

(continuing)
Numb to the death of my own kids.
Vietnam. That's why I never did
cry for my kids. He was five and
she was eight. She was a stranger,
my little girl. That fucking
Vietnam, you caused this. My
feelings are all fucked up. I said
to myself, "Why can't I feel?" I
said, "Why didn't I save them? Why
couldn't I save them?" I kept
thinking about Vietnam. About all
the times I think I died.

By now we are close enough to see the silhouette of lester
Farley, slumped down on the driver's side. He lights a
cigarette and for an instant we see his face.
87

88

89

90

93.

CONTINUED: 87

LES' VOICE
(continuing)
That's how I began to know I can't
die. Because I died already.

LESTER'S POV; (TELEPHOTO SHOT): In the distance, from around
a turn we see the lights of a car approaching. It is the
identical shot from the opening of the film.

LES' VOICE
(continuing)
Because I died already in Vietnam.

TIGHT ON LESTER--he leans forward, turns on the ignition

ON THE TRUCK--as the headlights turn on. Again, it is the
identical shot from the opening of the film. As the truck
pulls away we CUT TO:

TELEPHONE RINGING OVER:
INT. NATHAN'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING 88

Nathan asleep, is awakened by the telephone. Groggily, he
fumbles for the receiver.

NATHAN
Hello..?

As he listens we hear from the distance, "Bewitched, Bothered
and Bewildered." playing on the radio:

EXT. COLEMAN'S HOUSE 89

WIDE SHOT--It is a summer night, Coleman and Nathan are
dancing. Over this we HEAR:

COLEMAN
I hear that and everything within
me unclenches and the wish not to
die, never to die is almost too
great to bear.

EXT. WATERFALL, OUTSIDE ATHENA -DAY 90

ON A GRAY SKY--we see crows circling overhead THE CAMERA PANS
DOWN past a frozen waterfall; in the F.G. is a precipice
where a handful of people have gathered. THE CAMERA COMES TO
REST ON NATHAN ZUCKERMAN standing at the edge of the crowd.

HIS POV: of the mourners. A small woman with granny glasses
(SALLY) is speaking.
94.

90 CONTINUED: 90

91

A WOMAN'S VOICE
We all lived with Faunia up at the
farm and that's why we are here
this morning, to celebrate a life.
Faunia Farley was, as you know, a
deeply spiritual person.

As Sally's eulogy continues we PAN ACROSS TO NATHAN who is
looking O.S.

HIS POV:Among the mourners we notice an older, aristocratic
looking couple (FAUNIA'S MOTHER AND STEP-FATHER); she wears
a fur coat, he is perfectly groomed. They look very out of
place.

NATHAN'S VOICE OVER
Not a word about the accident
itself. And certainly not a word
to suggest what I knew without a
doubt - that it had been no
accident.

CLOSE ON A PAIR OF HANDS--holding an urn; as we watch it is
tipped and Faunia's ashes spill out into the river below; a
moment later the box containing the ashes of Faunia's
children is held up and it is overturned as well.

INT. NORTH HAMPTON VA HOSPITAL CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 91

We see a blank wall, the lighting is flourescent and
institutional. In the FOREGROUND we see Lester Farley. He is
being interviewed by a PSYCHOLOGIST. What we are watching is
videotape.

LES
They thought the Wall had saved
me, but I faked them out. Use my
vehicle, that was the plan. Along
the river, come right at them,
same lane... suicide mission...

PSYCHOLOGIST
At what point did you get in your
truck?
LES
This is all confidential, right?
PSYCHOLOGIST
Ummm. . .
LES

After dark.
91 CONTINUED:

Silence.

95.

91
PSYCHOLOGIST
Had you had dinner?
LES
No dinner.
PSYCHOLOGIST

Why did you get in the truck?

LES
To get him.

PSYCHOLOGIST
To get who?

LES
The Jew professor.

PSYCHOLOGIST
Why were you going to get him?

LES
Because I had to.

PSYCHOLOGIST
Why did you have to?

PSYCHOLOGIST
(continuing)
You were going to kill him.

LES
Oh, yes, all of us.
PSYCHOLOGIST
There was planning then.
LES
No planning.
PSYCHOLOGIST
You knew what you were doing?
LES
Yes.
PSYCHOLOGIST

But you didn't plan it.

LES
No.
91 CONTINUED:

With that the screen suddenly goes black and we CUT TO:

(2)

PSYCHOLOGIST
Did you think you were back in
Vietnam?

LES
No Vietnam.

PSYCHOLOGIST
Were you thinking about the kids?
You told me this woman killed your
children. Was this payback?

LES
No payback.

PSYCHOLOGIST
Weren't you trying to get revenge,
to take revenge for that?

LES
No revenge.
PSYCHOLOGIST
Were you depressed?
LES
No, no depression.
PSYCHOLOGIST
Angry?
LES

No more anger.

PSYCHOLOGIST
But you drove your truck into
their car?

LES
I didn't kill them.

PSYCHOLOGIST
Then who killed them?

LES
(he smiles for the
first time)
They killed themselves.

96.

91
97.

92 INT. ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE, NORTH HAMPTON HOSPITAL ~ DAY 92

We see the PSYCHOLOGIST who interviewed Lester Farley with
his SUPERVISING DOCTOR; they have been watching a videotape.

DOCTOR
Well?
SUPERVISOR
Did you check the police report?
PSYCHOLOGIST
Yes.
DOCTOR
(writing as he is
talking)

Were there any marks on Farley's
truck that would indicate a
collision with Silk's car?

PSYCHOLOGIST
No, but he could--

DOCTOR
(he continues to
write)
Any signs on Coleman Silk's car
that he was sideswiped by Farley's
truck?

The psychologist shakes his head.

DOCTOR

(continuing; he looks

up, smiles)
Delusional. Lester Farley is
completely delusional, but
harmless. Continue with the
regular outpatient treatment.
Thorazine where indicated.

As he closes Lester Farley's folder we CUT TO:
93 EXT. PATHWAY IN THE WOODS - DAY 93

A path, leading from the place where Faunia' service was
conducted toward the road. THE CAMERA TRACKS WITH Faunia's
mother and her husband (FAUNIA'S STEPFATHER) .

FAUNIA'S MOTHER
(agitated)
But I'm her mother! If she kept a
diary--
93 CONTINUED:

98.

93

As they walk past THE CAMERA we see Nathan behind them,

listening.

Just then

NATHAN'S VOICE OVER
So Faunia knew how to read.

FAUNIA'S STEPFATHER
It's filth!

FAUNIA'S MOTHER (0.S.)
But it's all I have left.

Nathan catches up to them.

NATHAN
Excuse me, I wonder if I could
have a word with--

FAUNIA'S STEPFATHER
(stiff)
We're catching a plane.

NATHAN
(pressing on)
Coleman Silk was a friend of mine
and--

The following is all overlapping.

FAUNIA'S STEPFATHER
(growing angry)
I told you we have no--

NATHAN
(raising his voice)
He did not drive his car off the--

FAUNIA'S MOTHER
Listen to the man, Charles--

FAUNIA'S STEPFATHER
This is insane!

FAUNIA'S MOTHER
(to her husband)
Stop pushing me,

NATHAN
It was your daughter's ex-husband.
He killed them--

FAUNIA'S STEPFATHER
This woman is seriously ill--
99.

93 CONTINUED: (2) 93

NATHAN
But you have her diary--

FAUNIA'S STEPFATHER
There is no diary. I have burned
the diary.

He takes his wife by the arm and they walk away we HOLD ON
NATHAN watching them.

NATHAN'S VOICE OVER
Although, I knew beyond a shadow
of a doubt that Lester Farley had
murdered Coleman and Faunia;
whatever proof I had was gone.
What could I do about it? What
should I do about it?

We HEAR: BACH'S FUGUE in D MINOR -
94 INT. RISHANGER CHAPEL, ATHENA COLLEGE - DAY 94
ON A STAINED GLASS WINDOW

NATHAN'S VOICE OVER
By contrast to Faunia's funeral,
Coleman's was stage managed to the
nth degree by his family. This was
to be Coleman's formal
rehabilitation into the Athena
College pantheon of heroes -and
Coleman's children had spared no
pains to get out the vote. They
had even found a sacrificial lamb.

PAN DOWN FROM to Herb Keeble as he mounts the pulpit. There
is a beat of silence.

HERB

(quietly)
My name is Herbert Keble. I am
chairman of the Political Science
Department - and I was among those
who did not rise to Coleman's
defense when he was accused of
racism.

Throughout this we CROSS CUT TO THE SILK PEW - where
Coleman's children sit: Jeff, Mark (wearing a yarmulke) and
Lisa in tears. We also see all the characters from the
college we've met, from the couple who avoided Coleman
outside the library, even a stoic Delphine Roux along with
Nelson Primus and his wife. And near the back Nathan
Zuckerman off by himself, listening, watching.
94

95

100.

CONTINUED: 94
HERB
(continuing)
"Coleman, I can't be with you on
this." That is what I said, to my

everlasting shame. Oh, I had my
reasons. I thought I could help
better behind the scenes. If I
allied myself publicly, I told
myself, I risked being labeled an
Uncle Tom and thereby useless. I
was wrong! I should never have
said to my friend, "I can't be

with you on this." I should have
said, "I MUST be with you on
this." I should have spoken up to

say what I want to say now in the
presence of his former colleagues
and especially in the presence of
his children: that the alleged
misconduct never took place.
Coleman Silk and his wife Iris
were betrayed by the moral
stupidity of a censorious,
coercive community and I was a
member of that community. We all
were.

Nathan looks around. People are crying.

EXT. CEMETERY - LATER 95
The service is over, people drift away from the gravesite.
CLOSE ON TWO ADJOINING TOMBSTONES which read:

IRIS SILK 1934-1998 COLEMAN SILK 1930-

Nathan remains, lost in thought as people disappear around
him. Only gradually is he aware...

There's a WOMAN perhaps 62, still standing by the grave,
primly holding her purse, a blank expression on her face.

She is a light-skinned African American.

NATHAN
Mrs. Keble?
(she looks at him)
I believe your husband's eulogy
changed everything today.

The woman turns to him.
95

96

101.

CONTINUED: 95

WOMAN
I'm not Mrs. Keble.

TIGHT ON NATHAN, as he slowly realizes -

NATHAN
You're...Are you Coleman's sister?
INT. MADAMASKA INN - LATER 96

Nathan and Ernestine are sitting in the lounge of a quaint,
country inn.

TIGHT ON THE HAND OF A WAITER--as he serves them tea.

NATHAN
Lemon or milk?
ERNESTINE
Milk.
(then: )

That day Walter told Coleman never
to contact mother again - he froze
everything forever.

NATHAN
Your mother obeyed Walter?

ERNESTINE

All the Silk men from my father on
down are very decisive, Mr.
Zuckerman. Yes, she did. But I
didn't. I'd phone Coleman on his
birthday, things like that... I
was trying to reach him two days
ago, his seventieth birthday...
the day after he was killed.

(realizes)
I must have spoken to one of my
nephews-

(she looks away for

a moment then

regaining her

composure)
I don't blame Walter; he was
trying to spare my mother more
heartache.

NATHAN
Did he succeed?

ERNESTINE
When she died in the hospital, she
was delirious. :
96 CONTINUED:

102.

96

ERNESTINE (cont'd)
She kept saying, "Oh nurse, get me
to the train, I got a sick baby at
home..." Over and over. Walter
and I knew who that sick baby was.

NATHAN
Is Walter still alive?

ERNESTINE

Oh, yes. We're all a family of
teachers, Mr. Zuckerman, imagine.
Even Coleman's side of the
family -I wish our parents had
known that. And Walter was the
first colored superintendant of
schools in the state of New Jersey.

(smiles)
I guess you can tell what
generation I am - I say "colored"
and "Negro".

NATHAN
Did you know why your brother
resigned from the college?

ERNESTINE .
I gather he was accused of racism.
(smiles sadly)
That beats all, doesn't it?

NATHAN
For using the word "spooks".

ERNESTINE
Sounds like from what I've heard
today that anything is possible
nowadays. People are just getting
dumber - but more opinionated.
The year I retired, youngsters
were telling me that for Black
History Month they would only read
a biography of a black BY a black.
What kind of silly idea is "Black
History Month" anyway? If you're
going to study Charles Drew, you
do him when you do "science",
don't segregate him in "Black
History Month", for heavens sake.

NATHAN
I'm afraid I don't know who
Charles Drew is.
96 CONTINUED:

103.

(2) 96

ERNESTINE
Shame on you, Mr. Zuckerman. Dr.
Charles Drew discovered how to
prevent blood from clotting so it
could be banked. Then he was
injured in a car accident and the
nearest hospital would not take
colored, so he bled to death.

Silence as Nathan contemplates this. She looks at him -

ERNESTINE

(continuing)
You know what's sad, Mr.
Zuckerman? Nowadays it's
impossible to imagine anyone doing
what my brother felt he had to do
then... constructing his whole
life around a lie. He could have
stopped that racism charge in its
tracks - I wonder if that solution
even occurred to him. Tell me
something, Mr. Zuckerman. Did he
ever acknowledge what he'd done?
To anyone?

CLOSE ON NATHAN--He is silent for a long beat.

NATHAN
No, I don't think so. I don't
think he did.

ERNESTINE

(a rueful smile)
So he was Coleman until the end.
Set out to do something and do it
all the way. Even to the point of
being buried as Jew.

(sadly)
Oh, Coleman...

She stands; Nathan stands as well.

ERNESTINE
(continuing)
Well, It's been quite a day...

THE CAMERA MOVES WITH THEM as they start towards the door.

NATHAN
Are you going to tell Walter?

ERNESTINE
Not unless he asks.
104.

96 CONTINUED: (3) 96
NATHAN
What about Coleman's children?
ERNESTINE
It was for Coleman to tell them;
not me.
NATHAN

97

98

But you told me.
ERNESTINE
No, you said, "You're Coleman's
sister," and I admitted it. I'm
not the one with something to hide.
ERNESTINE
(continuing; she
extends a hand)
Thank you for your hospitality...
NATHAN
May I come and visit you in New
Jersey? I'd very much like to meet
Walter.

ERNESTINE
Let me think about it...

And she walks out the door.
INT. NATHAN'S CAR ~- DUSK 97
Nathan driving carefully, lost in thought. Abruptly he reacts-

HIS POV - PARKED BY THE ROADSIDE, A SNOW-COVERED, RED
PICKUP.

Nathan studies the car, slows down... Stops.

Gets out - the middle of nowhere on a chilly twilight. Nathan
walks around the truck, studying it... the murder weapon...

On the rear bumper: MIA/POW...

FOOTSTEPS in the SNOW lead into the woods...

Nathan looks around, hesitates, decides to follow them...
EXT. WOODS - TWILIGHT 98

SEVERAL ANGLES - Nathan making his way cautiously through the
whiteness of trees... until he comes out onto -
105.

99 EXT. FROZEN LAKE - TWILIGHT 99
As Nathan emerges from the woods, looking...

NATHAN'S POV - a stunning vista of white... the LAKE is
frozen over. No signs of civilization, but-

In the middle of the lake, a lone FIGURE sits on an upturned
yellow BUCKET, hunched over a HOLE in the ice, a fishing line
in his hands: LESTER, dressed in black wool CAP, pulled down
over his forehead and ears... heavy overalls, boots, etc.

Nathan doesn't move. But the FIGURE sees him. Now or never.
Nathan's expression of fear and determination...

CLOSE: NATHAN'S FOOT steps gingerly onto the ice. It HOLDS.
Then his OTHER FOOT. The feet start walking...

LOW POV - Nathan's FEET, the figure of Lester getting CLOSER.
Finally, Nathan's feet stop, twenty feet away from him...

LES
(doesn't look up)
You're on thin ice.
The men look at one another.

NATHAN
I'd say we both are. Fish biting?

LES
Not too good; not too bad...

He glances away. Nathan does too and perceives several neat
CIRCULAR HOLES dug randomly in the ice -

AND A FOUR FOOT METAL SHAFT ending in a CORKSCREW BLADE: a
lethal-looking AUGER, rotated by the cranked handle on top.

Nathan's glance up from the deadly tool bumps into Les' eyes.

NATHAN
Beautiful spot.

LES
Why I'm here...

NATHAN
Peaceful.

LES

Away from all the craziness. I'm
out of it.

(steals another

glance)
Long as I can keep it secret...
106.

99 CONTINUED: 99

NATHAN
True enough. Only now I know.

Les glances up again, then back at his fishing line-

LES
You look like a man who can keep
a secret. Aren't you the writer?

NATHAN
What do you think about if the
fish aren't biting?

He doesn't answer for a moment, then -

LES
I was thinking if I had a son he'd
be out here with me now, fishing.
That's what I was thinking when
you walked out here. Thought you
might have been my son.

NATHAN
Do you have a son?
LES
No.
NATHAN

Never married?
Another pause. Then, finally, he makes a face -

LES

Doomed.

(he jiggles the line)
When I came back from Vietnam I
couldn't relate to anybody.

(looking around)
Clean clothes, folks saying Hello,
going to parties - I couldn't
relate to it anymore. Used to get
in my car and drive around. My
buddies were afraid I was going to
die in a car accident, they were-

NATHAN
Were you ever in a car accident?

LES
(smiles)
Wouldn't know if I was.

NATHAN
You still have PTSD? Post
Traumatic Stress Disorder?

LES
Well, I tend to isolate, don't I?
What do you think I'm doing out
here?

NATHAN
But no more car accidents...

LES
There were never any accidents.
Don't you listen?

NATHAN
And no kids.

LES
Nope. You?

NATHAN
No.

LES
Married?

NATHAN
No more.

LES

So, you and me in the same boat.
What kind of books you write?

NATHAN
I. write about people like you.

LES
Is that so? What's the name of
one of your books?

NATHAN
(hesitates)
The Human Stain. It's not finished.

LES
When it is, I'll buy it.

NATHAN
I'll send you a copy. What's your
name?
99 CONTINUED:

LES
Les Farley; send it care of Pete's
Garage...
NATHAN

I will if you promise to read it.

Les rises, putting down the fishing line and picking up the
dreadful-looking corkscrew AUGER.

As Nathan,

transfixed with fear watches, Les brings it over

to him, crunching ominously on the thin ice, holding it under
Nathan's nose.

Do we hear the ICE CRACKING under their combined weight?

Nathan so

Satisfied

LES
I started ice fishing after my
wife left me. All you have to do
is dress warm and own the right
equipment - like this auger. You
drill a hole through the ice.
This'1ll cut through just about
anything - and drop your line with
your favorite lure right through.

frightened he can't speak -

LES

(continuing)
Any flash down there and the fish
are attracted. They're sensitive
to movement. The smallest
vibration can alert them - even in
the dark. And it's way dark down
there...

that Nathan is frightened, his tone changes -

LES
(continuing)
If I had a son, Little Les, a son
of my own, I reckon I'd be
teaching him all this stuff
instead of you.

NATHAN
It's cold out here...

LES
You better believe it.

NATHAN
(taking a step
backwards)
I should be going...

LES
But you know your ice fishing now,
don't you? You can put it in your
book...

Nathan continues backing up, still facing Les and that DRILL -~

NATHAN
Don't worry - I will...

LES
And you know my secret place here.
You know everything now, don't
you? But you won't tell, will you?

NATHAN
I hear you...

LES
(a beat then)
And, hey, Mr. Zuckerman.

ON NATHAN--He freezes.
LES
(continuing)

What about the book?

NATHAN
You got it, it's in the mail.
WIDE ANGLE (NATHAN'S POV): Les stands motionless on the ice,
holding the auger, as Nathan slowly, cautiously, turns and
walks back towards shore. Snow begins to fall and as we HOLD
ON LES FARLEY the snow grows thicker until the screen is
white. We HOLD FOR A BEAT

SOUND OVER: THE LIGHT CLICKING SOUNDS OF TYPING ON A
COMPUTER KEYBOARD...

CLOSE ON COMPUTER SCREEN AS TYPING APPEARS - 100

This is the story of the tricky life and bitter downfall of
Coleman Silk.

Nathan's VOICE mumbles the words over his typing...
