INT. BEDROOM -- NIGHT

Beginning title sequence: the CAMERA TRAVELS gracefully over
a woman's body. The BLACK AND WHITE images are smooth,
classy, beautiful. This sequence continues until we've seen
every part of a woman's body that we can see in a PG-13 movie.
Finally, the woman's hair fills the screen. It is long,
flowing, thick black hair. The final title fades in:

EVIL ANGEL

And then, in SLOW MOTION, the woman's hair parts. The CAMERA
SPEED rapidly increases as color fills the screen, and a
terrifying, ghostly white face thrusts itself toward us.

The eyes are red in black sockets. The demon's teeth are
razor sharp, and there is blood in her mouth. She screams.

EXT. CITY STREET -- NIGHT

GEOFF MORGAN screams, too. He staggers back on a busy street
and bumps into a YOUNG COUPLE on a date. Geoff, 34, is
dressed in a long, black coat. Beneath the coat he wears a
nice shirt and a loose necktie.

YOUNG MAN
Hey, watch it, man.

But Geoff keeps staring ahead, at two HOOKERS who stand
against a brick building. They look back at him, startled.
One of them has long black hair, but her face is quite human.

Terrified, Geoff turns and runs. He pushes his way through
the crowd.

He sees the marquee of a movie theater: CHARLIE CHAPLIN'S
CITY LIGHTS with LIVE ORCHESTRA. TONIGHT ONLY.

Geoff runs to the ticket booth of the theater. The girl at
the ticket booth is looking down at her cash drawer. She
hears Geoff and she looks up, but she's not the pimply-faced
teenager we expect. She's the demon. She screams through a
blood-filled mouth.

Geoff shouts and staggers backward into the street. A taxi
swerves to miss him. Geoff looks back at the ticket booth,
but the demon is gone. A sweet-looking, and very confused,
TEENAGED GIRL watches from behind the glass.

Geoff spins around. He sees a huge, blue neon cross attached
to the top of the building across the street. He lurches
toward the building and steps directly into the path of an
oncoming ambulance.

INT. AMBULANCE -- NIGHT

The ambulance driver, JENNY, swerves.
JENNY
Whoa! Shit!

Jenny, 26, is a street-hardened beauty. Riding shotgun is
MARCUS GALAN, 27. He's not tall, but he's dark and handsome.
He has the radio mike in his hand.

MARCUS
Whoa!

JENNY

I almost killed that crazy bastard!

You see that?
EXT. CITY STREET -- NIGHT
Geoff staggers across the street.
INT. AMBULANCE -- NIGHT
Marcus is on the radio.

MARCUS

Unit 5 in transit. We're two minutes

away.
EXT. DOWNTOWN CHURCH -- NIGHT
Geoff pounds on the doors of the church building. The doors
are locked. Two YOUNG WOMEN approach on the sidewalk.
Frightened, Geoff runs to the adjoining building, a hotel.
INT. HOTEL -- NIGHT
Geoff stumbles into the hotel. The small lobby leads into a
classy restaurant. A sexy HOSTESS waits at the podium, her
back to Geoff. She is speaking with CAMILLE JENSEN, 30, a
nicely-dressed hotel manager. As Geoff approaches, the
hostess turns to him.

HOSTESS
May I help you, sir?

As she speaks, her voice and her face turn demonic.
Geoff shouts. He runs to the elevator. A WELL-DRESSED COUPLE
is inside. The door is closing. The woman sees Geoff

approaching. She reaches out to stop the doors.

Geoff sees the woman's hand. It has turned into a claw. He
shouts. He goes for the stairs.

INT. SLUM APARTMENTS -- NIGHT
Marcus and Jenny burst into the lobby of a low-rent downtown

apartment building. There is no elevator. They go directly
to the stairs and start up.
INT. HOTEL -- NIGHT

Geoff runs up the stairs. We see deep down into the
stairwell. He is several flights up.

INT. SLUM APARTMENTS -- NIGHT

Marcus and Jenny get to the door.

MARCUS
413. This is it.
JENNY
Where's the welcome party?
MARCUS
(bangs on the door)

Hello!
A woman shouts from the other side of the door.

KARINA (V.O.)
Ayudame!

Marcus tries the door. It is locked.

MARCUS
(to the woman inside)
The door is locked! Can you open
the door?

KARINA (V.O.)
No! Por Favor! Ayudame!

JENNY
Knock it down, man. Get macho.

Marcus steps back. He kicks the door hard, near the handle.
The door bursts open, splintering the frame.

EXT. ROOFTOP -- NIGHT

Geoff bursts out onto the roof. He is exhausted.

He sees the top of the huge neon cross. He closes the door
behind him. He runs to the cross. He embraces it. He looks

around, insane with fear. The door to the roof blows open.

GEOFF
No!

But there is no one there. He puts a leg over the short
wall. He climbs out onto the ledge, and he holds to the
cross.
INT. KARINA'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

Marcus and Jenny drop to the floor where a young latina,
KARINA, 15, lies on some pillows and sofa cushions. She is
very pregnant and is in labor. The telephone is on the floor
next to her. She wears a gold crucifix around her neck.

MARCUS
It's alright. We're here. We're
here.

KARINA
Me estoy muriendo! Mi hijo, esta
muriendo!

MARCUS

No, no. Esta bien. Ya estamos aqui.
Vas a estar bien.

Marcus quickly pulls on his plastic gloves and reaches under
the girl's skirt.

JENNY
Where is she?

MARCUS
She's at ten. Looks like we're having
a baby.
(to Karina)
No te empujes. Esta bien. Tu bebe
estara bien.

EXT. CITY STREET -- NIGHT

A crowd exits the movie theater. They are dressed in suits
and evening gowns.

A 5-year-old BOY holds his parents hands as they start across
the street. He looks up. And stops.

BOY
Batman.

MOM
What did you say, honey?

BOY
(points up)
Batman.

The parents look up. They see Geoff on the ledge.

MOM
No, honey. That's not Batman.
(to her husband)
David.
DAD
I'll get somebody.

Dad runs back toward the building. Others see the Mom and
little boy looking up. They also look up. Word begins to
spread.

EXT. ROOFTOP -- NIGHT

Geoff clings to the cross. His shoe slips on the ledge. He
holds tighter.

The metal brace on the sign creaks. A bolt dislodges from
the brick. This sign is not going to hold.

INT. KARINA'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

MARCUS
Here he comes.

The girl groans. Shawn kneels beside her head. He brushes
the hair from her face.

JENNY
You're almost done, girl.

Karina looks down and watches the baby crown.

EXT. ROOFTOP -- NIGHT

Geoff looks down. Quite a crowd has gathered.

EXT. CITY STREET -- NIGHT

Some SECURITY GUARDS try to move the people back away from
the building. The Mom, Dad, and boy move back. A squad car
arrives and two COPS jump out.

EXT. ROOFTOP -- NIGHT

The bolt pulls out farther. Geoff gasps. He reaches out
and grabs the ledge.

Camille, the hotel manager, steps out through the open doorway
onto the roof. She's wearing a dress, but no coat. She
holds her arms close to her body as she approaches.

Geoff sees her. He steps back onto the cross. The metal
braces groan. He looks down and then back at her. She stops
several feet away.

CAMILLE
Sir?

He looks at her.
CAMILLE (CONT'D)
I--I work for the hotel. I don't
know what...I'm supposed to do.

Another bolt dislodges. Camille gasps.
INT. KARINA'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT
Karina shouts again.

MARCUS
He's got the cord around his neck.

JENNY
(to Karina)
You're gonna be alright.

MARCUS
Twice. Dammit.

Jenny looks at Marcus.

MARCUS (CONT'D)
It's alright. I got it.

EXT. ROOFTOP -- NIGHT
Geoff looks down at the circus below. Then back at Camille.

She looks toward the open door, as if expecting help. She
holds out her hand

CAMILLE

You've got to give me your hand.
GEOFF

I--I can't.
CAMILLE

The sign's going to fall. You've
got to give me your hand.

GEOFF
I'm scared.

The bolt pulls free.

CAMILLE
Give me your hand!

INT. APARTMENT -- NIGHT

MARCUS
Got it!
(to Karina)
Empuje!
EXT. ROOFTOP -- NIGHT
The sign begins to slide.

CAMILLE
Now!

Two policemen arrive at the door. Geoff puts out his hand.
As his hand touches Camille's fingers, he sees that her hand
has become a claw. He looks up into her demonic face. Her
mouth and eyes open wide.

GEOFF
NOOOOO! !!!

He yanks his hand back. His feet slip. He loses his balance.
He spins around. Camille gasps. For a brief moment, Geoff
hangs in the air, his arms stretched out at his sides.

EXT. CITY STREET -- NIGHT

The boy looks up at Geoff.

BOY
Batman.

EXT. ROOFTOP -- NIGHT

And then Geoff falls, fast.
EXT. CITY STREET -- NIGHT
The crowd pulls back.

COP
Oh shit.

EXT. ROOFTOP -- NIGHT

Camille stares at the empty space that Geoff had just
occupied.

Geoff falls, at first slowly, gracefully. He picks up speed.
INT. KARINA'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

MARCUS
He's coming. He's almost here.

EXT. CITY STREET -- NIGHT
We see the concrete sidewalk coming up fast.
EXT. ROOFTOP -- NIGHT

Camille watches Geoff fall.
EXT. CITY STREET -- NIGHT
The Boy watches, in horror.

Geoff's body lands face-up on the roof of a car. The car's
windows explode. The crowd recoils.

THE CAMERA RACES at lightning speed from the hit, through
the crowd, to a CLOSE-UP on the Boy's wide-eyed face. A
speck of blood hits his cheek.

EXT. ROOFTOP -- NIGHT

Camille turns away.

INT. KARINA'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

MARCUS
Got him!

Marcus lifts the baby. The child is male. He's covered in
blood, but isn't crying. Jenny has a suction bulb ready.

JENNY
(into her radio)
We got an APGAR of...two.
Marcus sucks the mucous from the baby's nose and mouth.
EXT. CITY STREET -- NIGHT

The crowd freaks out. Mom kneels at the Boy's level.

MOM
Charlie, honey? Are you okay?

He turns to her. She sees the blood on his cheek. She gasps.
EXT. ROOFTOP -- NIGHT

Camille swoons. The policemen arrive. They hold her up.
One of the cops looks down at Geoff's body.

EXT. CITY STREET -- NIGHT

Geoff isn't quite dead. He looks up at the neon cross, which
still clings to the rooftop above. His eyes glaze over.

We see Geoff's fading point of view of the cross. The image
DISSOLVES TO...

INT. KARINA'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

...The silver crucifix around Karina's neck. Her breathing
is labored. She looks at the baby.

Marcus turns the baby over in his arms.
MARCUS
Come on, little man!

The baby shivers, and then breathes, then cries.

MARCUS (CONT'D)
There we go!

JENNY
(into the radio)
We got him. He's breathing.

MARCUS
(cradles the baby)
He's gonna be just fine.
(to Karina)
Bien bonito. Mira. Esta bien.

Karina smiles, still breathing heavily. She sinks back.
INT. EMERGENCY ROOM -- NIGHT

Marcus and Jenny push a gurney through the main doors of the
emergency room. Karina and her baby are on the gurney. A
DOCTOR meets them.

DOCTOR
How's the little guy?

MARCUS
He's 100 percent. Already nursing.

DOCTOR
How long was he without oxygen?

MARCUS
I don't know. Maybe a minute or so.

Another EMT approaches. This is SHAWN, 28, a black man who
expresses as much reggae as his uniform allows.

DOCTOR
Okay. Good job. We'll check him out.

SHAWN
Marcus, you on the clock?

MARCUS
I just brought this girl in--

SHAWN
We got a stabbing on Fifth South.
Jen can handle the paperwork.

MARCUS
I gotta--
10.

SHAWN
Come on! We got blood!

MARCUS
Right.
(to Jenny)
Busy night.

JENNY
(shrugs)
I got it.

EXT. CITY STREETS -- NIGHT

The ambulance races through the city.
INT. AMBULANCE -- NIGHT

Shawn drives. Marcus is riding shotgun.

SHAWN
So you're a daddy again. How many
does that make?

MARCUS
Five, counting this one.

SHAWN
You think she's gonna name it after
you?

Shawn laughs. Marcus smiles and shakes his head.
EXT. HOMELESS SHELTER -- NIGHT

The ambulance stops at a homeless shelter. Three police
cars have already arrived. A crowd of HOMELESS MEN AND WOMEN
has gathered. Two COPS stand at the door to the shelter.

Marcus and Shawn grab their kits and enter the building.
One of the policemen leads them in.

INT. HOMELESS SHELTER -- NIGHT

The policeman leads Marcus and Shawn into a huge room lined
with tables. There are plates of uneaten food on the tables.
Two POLICEMEN stand near a HOMELESS MAN who kneels near one
of the benches. His hands are cuffed behind his back.

POLICEMAN
She's over here.

The policeman leads Marcus and Shawn into the kitchen area.
A small crowd has gathered around a young woman who is lying
on the floor in a pool of blood. FATHER CARLISLE, 58, an
Episcopal priest, is holding the woman's hand. He rises as
Marcus drops to one knee at the woman's side.
11.
He has blood on his hands.

She is young, in her early 20's, and innocently pretty.
This is EMMA. A long, bloody kitchen knife lies on the floor
only a few feet away.

CARLISLE
She was stabbed, I don't know...four
or five times. I tried to stop the

bleeding.
Shawn is immediately on his radio. Marcus sees the girl's
face. He is instantly confused.
MARCUS
(unsure)

I know this girl.

SHAWN
We've got a female, early 20's,
multiple stab wounds to the abdomen.
We need O negative standing by.

MARCUS
What's her name?

CARLISLE
Emma. Carillo.

MARCUS
Emma, can you hear me?

She nods.

MARCUS (CONT'D)
We're going to help you through this,
alright? But you're gonna have to
help us, too, okay?

She nods. Her eyes close. Marcus touches her face.
MARCUS (CONT'D)
I know it hurts, but you're gonna
have to stay awake for me. Can you
do that?
She nods.

MARCUS (CONT'D)
We gotta move her. Now!

INT. AMBULANCE -- NIGHT

Shawn drives. They are racing through the city with a police
escort. Marcus is in the back with Emma.
12.
MARCUS
We're almost there, Emma. You stay
with me, you hear?

Emma touches his hand. She says something.

MARCUS (CONT'D)
What? What was that?

EMMA
...Name.

MARCUS
You want to know my name?

She nods.

MARCUS (CONT'D)
It's Marcus.

She manages a smile.

EMMA
Marcus...

MARCUS
That's right.

EMMA
I.

MARCUS
What is it? What are you trying to
say?

EMMA
».-love...you...

Marcus is speechless. He looks down at her. She lightly
squeezes his hand. There is something so beautifully peaceful
in her expression, in her eyes.

Then her grip loosens. Her eyelids close. She's losing
consciousness.

MARCUS
Emma, stay with me! Emma!

She loses consciousness.

MARCUS (CONT'D)
Shawn! I'm losing her!

SHAWN
We're almost there!
13.
EXT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY BAY -- NIGHT
The ambulance pulls in. Marcus kicks the doors open as two

ER NURSES and a doctor, ROLLINS, meet the ambulance. They
all pull the gurney out.

MARCUS
She lost consciousness three minutes
ago.

ROLLINS

We've got her.
INT. EMERGENCY ROOM -- NIGHT

Rollins and the nurses push the gurney through the hallway.
Marcus walks with it.

MARCUS
Her name is Emma Carillo. She was
talking just three minutes ago.

ROLLINS
We've got her!

Marcus stops outside the trauma room door. He watches through
the window as the medical team attempts to resuscitate her.

INT. EMERGENCY ROOM -- NIGHT

Shawn fills out paperwork at the reception desk. Jenny
approaches.

JENNY
Where's Marcus?

SHAWN
Trauma 4.

INT. EMERGENCY ROOM -- NIGHT

Marcus watches through the window. Emma has been hooked up
to a monitor. She has flat-lined. Rollins uses the
defibrillator. No response.

INT. EMERGENCY ROOM -- NIGHT

JENNY
What you got?

SHAWN
Female. 23 years old. Some sick
bastard turned into Jack the Ripper.

JENNY
Nice.
14.

SHAWN
I think Marcus might've known her.

Jenny exits.
INT. EMERGENCY ROOM -- NIGHT

Marcus watches. The Doc gives it another try. Nothing.
Jenny joins Marcus at the window.

JENNY
How's she doing?

MARCUS
She's coming back.

The doc tries one last time.

MARCUS (CONT'D)
Come on.

Nothing.

MARCUS (CONT'D)
...Emma.

The Doctor calls it.

JENNY
God. I'm sorry.

MARCUS
No.

Marcus throws the door open and enters.

MARCUS (CONT'D)
She's not dead yet.

ROLLINS
What the hell is going on?

Marcus approaches the defibrillator.

MARCUS
Get back.

ROLLINS
Get away from that body!

MARCUS
I said get back!

He shocks her. Nothing.

JENNY
Marcus! Stop it!
15.

ROLLINS
She's dead!

MARCUS
Back off!

ROLLINS

You crazy son of a bitch!

MARCUS
Clear!

He shocks her again. Nothing.

JENNY
Marcus, leave her alone. She's dead,
man.

ROLLINS

(to a nurse)
Get security.

The nurse hurries out.
MARCUS
(to Emma)
Come on...CLEAR!

He shocks her again. Nothing. He takes her face. He
breathes into her mouth.

MARCUS (CONT'D)
Come on, Emma. Come on!

He presses on her chest. He breathes into her mouth.
INT. CAROLINE'S HOSPITAL ROOM -- NIGHT
A woman, CAROLINE, 26, awakens suddenly in a hospital bed.
She is alone in her room. She is hooked up to tubes and
wires. She looks around, disoriented, but without anxiety.
She sits up. She starts to free herself from the wires.
INT. HOSPITAL NURSE'S STATION -- NIGHT
The alarms begin to beep and blink on the nurses' console.
No one is at the station. They are all attending to the
situation with Marcus.
INT. EMERGENCY ROOM -- NIGHT

JENNY

This is crazy. You're gonna get

arrested!

Marcus presses on Emma's chest. He breathes into her mouth.
16.

JENNY (CONT'D)
Marcus!

MARCUS
She's coming back!

Two SECURITY GUARDS rush in. Marcus presses on her chest
again. The guards and the doctor grab Marcus. He fights.

MARCUS (CONT'D)
Emma! Emma! Goddammit!

As they pull him away, the nurses move toward the body.

MARCUS (CONT'D)
No!

They turn off the monitors.

MARCUS (CONT'D)
No!!

Rollins covers her with the sheet.

MARCUS (CONT'D)
NO!!!

EXT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY -- NIGHT

Caroline walks into the hallway. She sees the commotion.
She watches for a moment, gently bites her lower lip, then
walks in the opposite direction. No one notices her.

INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY -- NIGHT

Marcus is seated in a plastic chair in the hallway. He is
cuffed. Three security guards stand nearby. Shawn and Jenny
stand several feet away with Rollins and LATHROP, 48, a
hospital administrator.

LATHROP
I ought to have him arrested.

JENNY
He's a good medic.

LATHROP
He's already in hot water over that
hooker he killed last week.

SHAWN
Come on, man.

JENNY
That wasn't his fault and you know
it!
17.

SHAWN
Look, man. He knew this girl.

JENNY
What harm did he do? She was already
dead.

SHAWN

C'mon. We'll owe you one.
Lathrop shakes his head and sighs.
INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY -- NIGHT
CLOSE ON THE CUFFS being unlocked.
Lathrop stands next to Marcus. Jenny and Shawn hang back.
LATHROP
You had damn well better behave when
you're in my hospital. Do you
understand?

Marcus nods.

LATHROP (CONT'D)
Do you understand me?

MARCUS
Yeah.

Dr. Rollins gives a disgusted sigh and starts off.

ROLLINS
I'm putting in a call to Jack
Henderson. This isn't over.

Rollins collides with a MALE NURSE. The nurse recovers and
turns to Lathrop. Marcus stares into the O.R. at Emma's
lifeless body.

MALE NURSE

Mr. Lathrop, we're missing a patient.
LATHROP

Excuse me?
MALE NURSE

She was unconscious five minutes
ago. Now she's gone.

LATHROP
(back to Marcus)
Your behavior here was unacceptable.
Absolutely unacceptable.
18.

Marcus isn't even looking at Lathrop. He's still looking at
Emma's body.

LATHROP (CONT'D)
(to Shawn and Jenny)
You keep him under control. Whatever
he does, I'm holding both of you
responsible.

Shawn nods. Lathrop turns and follows the male nurse.
JENNY
(to Marcus)
You did know her, right?
INT. HOSPITAL SUPPLY CLOSET -- NIGHT

CLOSE ON FIRE EXSTINGUISHER. A woman's hands remove it from
its hook on the wall.

A young nurse, JO, 22, is kissing DANNY, 27, a maintenance
man. Danny gives her a small box tied with a ribbon.

DANNY

I got you something.
JO

What is it?
DANNY

Open it.
She opens it. It is a necklace with a gold heart.

JO
Oh my god.

She looks at him, adoringly. Caroline rises up behind Danny
and smashes the back of his head with the fire extinguisher.
The force of the blow throws his head into Jo's face, breaking
her nose and bouncing her head against the brick wall.

Danny falls. Blood pours from Jo's nose. She's too dazed
to scream. Her vision blurs, doubles. Caroline waits until
Jo's vision clears, then slams the extinguisher into the
girl's face.

EXT. HOSPITAL -- NIGHT

Caroline exits the hospital. She wears the nurse's uniform,
and she wears it well. Damn, she's hot.
EXT. AMBULANCE STATION -- NIGHT

Shawn drives the ambulance into the station driveway. Marcus
is in the passenger seat. They stop and wait as the bay
door opens.
19.

SHAWN
Maybe you just saw her at the grocery
store or something.

MARCUS
No, it's like, I don't know...it's
like I really knew her. Like she was
close to me.

SHAWN
Reincarnation. You knew her in a
previous life.

MARCUS
Total bullshit.

SHAWN
You never know, man. The universe,
it's one crazy place, you know?

MARCUS
I just...I knew her.

SHAWN
Well, it's a mystery.

Marcus moves to get out.

SHAWN (CONT'D)
Where are you going? It's thursday.
We're gonna get some beers.

MARCUS
I'm goin' home. Gotta clear my head.

SHAWN
Jen's coming.

MARCUS
I'm going home to my wife.

SHAWN
Alright, man. Just don't go back to
the hospital. Lathrop will have your
balls in a jar.

MARCUS
He'd probably sell ‘em on the black
market.

SHAWN

Man, the black market don't have no
interest in your teeny little Mexican
balls.

MARCUS
Go to hell.
20.

Marcus closes the ambulance door. Shawn drives the ambulance
into the open bay.

EXT. MARCUS'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

Marcus pulls his green Mustang into the driveway of an aging
rambler. He turns off the lights. Other cars are parked on
the street.

INT. MARCUS'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

Marcus enters. The lights are off. He doesn't turn them
on. He starts down the hallway. On the walls are family
photos, several of Marcus and Carla, his wife.

As he approaches the door, he hears muffled sounds. He stops,
listens. He silently turns the doorknob. He pushes the
door open a few inches.

INT. MARCUS'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

Marcus's wife, CARLA, 25, has a nice body, which is being
enjoyed at the moment by ED, 31. Marcus stands in the doorway
and watches.

After a moment, he quietly turns to go.

INT. MARCUS'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

Marcus starts down the hall. He stops. He looks at a
photograph on the wall. It is his wedding photo. He smashes
the photo with his fist.

INT. MARCUS'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

Ed and Carla jump out of bed.

CARLA
Oh! Marcus!

ED
Shit!

INT. MARCUS'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

Marcus punches the other photos on the wall.
INT. MARCUS'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

Ed grabs his pants and climbs out the window.

CARLA
Oh! Shit! Go, go!
21.
EXT. MARCUS'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

Ed falls from the window onto the garbage cans. He scrambles
to his feet, gathers his clothes, and runs.

INT. MARCUS'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

Marcus attacks the wall until all of the photos are down.
He looks at his bleeding knuckles.

At the other end of the hall, Carla steps into the doorway.
She holds a sheet against her chest. Marcus looks at her.
She starts to cry.

CARLA
I'm sorry.

EXT. FLEABAG MOTEL -- NIGHT

We see the malfunctioning neon sign of a fleabag motel, and
Marcus's Mustang in the parking lot.

INT. FLEABAG MOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT

Marcus sits at a tiny table near the window. He pours some
Wild Turkey into a cheap plastic hotel cup.

INT. MARCUS'S BATHROOM -- NIGHT
Carla stands at the sink. She looks at herself in the mirror.
She looks down at her arm. We see that her forearm is

scarred, the remains of old cuts.

She takes a razor blade and makes a tiny slice in the skin
of her forearm. It hurts, and bleeds. She does it again.

INT. FLEABAG MOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT

Marcus holds up the cup of whiskey. He looks at it. He
makes a decision. He pours the whiskey back into the bottle.

INT. HOSPITAL MORGUE -- NIGHT

KENNEDY, 38, a morgue worker, pulls back the sheet on Emma.
Marcus looks down on her.

KENNEDY
They're gonna take her over to County.

Marcus nods.

KENNEDY (CONT'D)
What's the deal?

MARCUS
I should've saved her.
22.

KENNEDY
Paramedic guilt, huh? Dude, she was
stabbed six times. In the gut. Even
if you'd saved her, she would've
been a mess for the rest of her life.

MARCUS
You mind if I sit here a while?
KENNEDY
Hell, I don't care. I'll be across
the hall.
MARCUS
Thanks.
KENNEDY

(turns back)
Hey, you're not turning into your
old partner, are you?

MARCUS
What?

KENNEDY
Martineau. He used to come down
here, sit with the bodies. Stare
into their eyes. Talk to 'em
sometimes.

MARCUS
I'm not turning into Martineau.

KENNEDY
That's good. 'Cause he's crazier
than a shit-house rat.

Marcus looks down at Emma's face.

KENNEDY (CONT'D)
There wasn't anything you could do,
man. She was dead before you even
showed up.

Kennedy goes. Marcus touches Emma's hand.
INT. BOARD ROOM -- MORNING

Marcus sits at a wooden table. An ATTORNEY sits beside him.
Shawn, Jenny, and other off-duty EMTs are seated behind him.
Two of the medics are uniformed. One of them is JACKSON,
30, a muscular and bald-by-choice white guy.

Several gruesome photographs of a dead young woman are pinned
to a bulletin board nearby. There is also a magnified driver's
license photo of the woman, LIZZIE MARKHAM, 20.
23.

Seated apart from the medics is a large man in a rumpled
suit. This is JOHN CARRUTHERS, 54.

JACK HENDERSON, 48, a heavy-set man who appears to be in
charge, is seated behind a large desk, which is on an elevated
platform. Four other EXECUTIVES are also seated on the
platform.

HENDERSON
It is noted that Ms. Markham was
wearing the medical identification
tag, which identified her as a
diabetic, around her ankle instead
of around her neck or wrist as
advised.

MARKS ON HER ARM, and, finally, A FULL BODY SHOT.

HENDERSON (CONT'D)
It was clearly difficult for Mr.
Galan to locate the tag, which
although on her person, was
effectively hidden.

INT. CRACKHOUSE APARTMENT -- NIGHT
FLASHBACK to the night of Lizzie's death. We see Marcus and
Jenny enter a crackhouse apartment. Lizzie is unconscious

on the floor near an unmade fold-out sofa bed.

From her wardrobe, she is clearly a hooker. And not an

expensive one. From the junkie paraphernalia on the floor
nearby, it's clear that Lizzie has recently shot up. Marcus
kneels at her side. He checks her jugular vein for a pulse.

HENDERSON (V.O.)
Due to the presence of heroin at the
scene, Mr. Galan's decision to
administer Narcan was appropriate.

INT. BOARD ROOM -- MORNING

HENDERSON
However, the presence of several
empty liquor bottles clearly led Mr.
Galan to presume that Ms. Markham's
subsequent lethargy was due to
intoxication rather than diabetic
shock.

INT. CRACKHOUSE APARTMENT -- NIGHT
Marcus prepares the syringe. Jen, in the background, talks

on her radio. We see others in the room. We will later
come to know them as RAY, PETRA, and JOSIE.
24.

Marcus injects Lizzie with the drug. Lizzie moans and rolls
her head. A moment later, she is racked with a seizure.

INT. BOARD ROOM -- MORNING

HENDERSON
It is noted that once the patient
seized, Mr. Galan correctly identified
her condition, but his efforts to
resuscitate her were unsuccessful.

Marcus looks down at the floor.

HENDERSON (CONT'D)
There are still too many uncertainties
in this case. Although we believe
that Mr. Galan will ultimately be
found faultless in this incident, we
feel that it is in his best interest,
and in the best interests of this
company, to delay our decision until
a full investigation can be made.

Henderson looks to Carruthers. Carruthers nods.

HENDERSON (CONT'D)
In the meantime, we find it prudent
to place Mr. Galan on suspension
without pay.

Jenny reacts with disgust.

HENDERSON (CONT'D)
Should the investigation clear Mr.
Galan of any wrong-doing, he will be
compensated for lost wages during
this period of suspension. Mr. Galan,
do you understand the action that is
being taken?

MARCUS
Yes.
HENDERSON
Do you have any questions?
MARCUS
No.
HENDERSON

These proceedings are adjourned until
the 14th of October.

Everyone rises and begins to disperse.

CLOSE ON PHOTO OF LIZZIE'S DEAD FACE.
25.
EXT. PARKING LOT -- DAY
Shawn and Jenny walk Marcus to his car.

SHAWN
That's bullshit, man. It's in their
best interest to find you guilty.
Then they don't have to pay you.

JENNY
Don't be an idiot. If they find him
guilty, then they've got a lawsuit.
This is all just to show that they're
taking some kind of action.

SHAWN
That's bullshit. You gotta fight
the man.

JENNY

Fight the man? What is this, 1969?
Fuck the man. That's what I say.

SHAWN
That's right.

They laugh, tap fists. Marcus looks toward a small park.
He sees Carla waiting for him. Shawn and Jenny also see
her.

SHAWN (CONT'D)
Hey. Give me a call. We'll catch a
flick tomorrow.

JENNY
I'll make you dinner.

MARCUS
Alright. Thanks. I'll see you guys.

They go. Marcus walks toward Carla.
EXT. DOWTOWN PARK -- DAY

Marcus is seated with Carla on a park bench. It has been a
difficult conversation.

MARCUS
I don't even want to know. It wasn't
me. That's all that matters.

CARLA
It's over. I swear. He's...he's a
real jerk. I just--Marcus. I'm

such an idiot.
26.

MARCUS
(rising)
I've heard all this before.

CARLA
I...I still love you.

MARCUS
We don't have kids. We don't really
have much stuff. It shouldn't turn
into a big deal.

CARLA
I don't want a divorce.

MARCUS
And I don't want a wife who has sex
with other men.

She turns away. He notices the fresh cuts on her forearm.
She doesn't hide them.

MARCUS (CONT'D)
I gotta go. I'll get an attorney, I
guess. I've never done this before.

CARLA
Me neither.

He turns and goes. She tries not to cry.
INT. VICTOR'S OFFICE -- AFTERNOON

CLOSE ON NEWSPAPER article on last night's jumper. VICTOR
CARRUTHERS, 34, is reading at his desk. He sets the newspaper
down. He appears anxious, afraid.

There is a knock on the door. Vic's father, the detective
we met earlier at Marcus's tribunal, sticks his head in.
There's a strong family resemblance.

VICTOR
Hey, Pop.

CARRUTHERS
I gotta take off. You want me to
lock up?

VICTOR
Yeah. Thanks.

CARRUTHERS
(concerned)
You alright?

VICTOR
Yeah...yeah. Have a good weekend.
27.

CARRUTHERS
You, too.

Carruthers goes. Victor looks back at the newspaper.
INT. CARRUTHERS RECEPTION ROOM -- AFTERNOON
Carruthers walks through the empty reception area. He exits.
We watch through the pebbled glass as he locks the dead bolt
from the outside. Stenciled on the pebbled glass:

CARRUTHERS AND CARRUTHERS - PRIVATE INVESTIGATIONS
EXT. HOMELESS SHELTER -- AFTERNOON

Father Carlisle helps unload boxes of canned food from a
small delivery truck. Marcus approaches.

MARCUS
Father?

Carlisle looks up.
MARCUS (CONT'D)

I was hoping I could talk to you for
a few minutes.

CARLISLE
You're one of the paramedics.
Marcus nods. Carlisle steps away from his work.
INT. CARLISLE'S OFFICE -- AFTERNOON

Carlisle's office is stacked with books, files, mounds of
fundraising fliers, stacks of donated clothing.

CARLISLE
She just came in here one day and
picked up a broom. She was seventeen
then. I told her she was too young.
But she just kept sweeping. She
said she was tired of playing silly
games with the girls at church. She
wanted to be a real Christian. Make
a real difference. And then she just
kept showing up. The Little Flower.

MARCUS
Excuse me?

CARLISLE
That's what I called her. 'Cause she
reminded me of Saint Terese.

MARCUS
I haven't been to mass in years.
28.

CARLISLE
Terese died young, too. Emma, she
was as good and pure as any saint
that ever lived. She truly was...
Our God is a cruel God, I think. To
allow such violence.

INT. CARRUTHER'S RECEPTION ROOM -- AFTERNOON

Victor closes his door and locks it. He turns and is startled
by a young woman who is sitting in the waiting room. It is

Caroline. She wears a sexy black dress.
VICTOR
Oh.
CAROLINE

I'm sorry. Did I startle you?

VICTOR
Yeah. I didn't--

CAROLINE
Do you have a few minutes? My
business won't take long.

He looks her over. She's hot, as we've mentioned before,
and she's showing a lot of thigh. She gently bites her lower
lip.

VICTOR
Sure. Come on in.

CAROLINE
Thank you.

He unlocks his door. She rises.
EXT. CRACKHOUSE -- AFTERNOON
Carruthers gets out of his car. He has parked in front of

an old brick apartment building. He starts up the steps. A
black hooker, JOSIE, 19, sits on the steps.

JOSIE
Hey, papa. You a cop?
CARRUTHERS
Nope.
JOSIE
You lookin' for skull? It's fifty
dollars.
CARRUTHERS

Sorry, little sister. Not today.
29.

JOSIE
You better get it 'fore it's gone,
baby.

Carruthers enters the building. The hooker turns her
attention back to the street.

JOSIE (CONT'D)
(talking to herself)
I'm the best there is, old man.
Worth more'n fifty dollars.

INT. VICTOR'S OFFICE -- AFTERNOON

Caroline, seated, crosses her legs. Victor leans against the
edge of his desk.

VICTOR
What can I help you with, Ms.--

CAROLINE
Lilith...will be fine.

VICTOR
Lilith. What can I do for you?

Caroline takes a cigarette case from her purse. She opens
it. She starts to take what looks like a cigarette.

VICTOR (CONT'D)
I don't allow smoking in my office.

She raises the cigarette a few inches from her chin.

CAROLINE
Who's smoking?

She puts the object in her mouth and we see that it isn't a
cigarette. It is a small tube. She blows.

A tiny dart sticks in Victor's neck, near the jugular. He
grabs his neck. He chokes. He slowly sinks to the floor.

He looks up at Caroline. She puts the tube back into its
case, and she removes a real cigarette. She lights it. From
Victor's point of view, we watch as she uncrosses her legs
and inhales a lung full of smoke.

INT. CRACKHOUSE APARTMENT -- AFTERNOON
We hear the sound of a dead bolt, unlocking. Then the door
opens. RAY, 48, a slumlord who moonlights as a pimp, leads

Carruthers into the apartment.

RAY
This is it. Not much to look at.
30.

CARRUTHERS
Thanks.

The place is as depressing as any apartment on earth. Dingy,
dirty, smelly. Peeling wallpaper and cheap furniture.

RAY
The cops already combed over
everything.
But Carruthers looks anyway.
RAY (CONT'D)
If somebody don't come claim it this
week, I'll just throw all this shit
out.
EXT. MARCUS'S HOUSE -- AFTERNOON
Marcus opens the door to his house.

MARCUS
Carla?...You here?

He stands, alone, in the center of the living room.
INT. MARCUS'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
Marcus packs his things into boxes. He packs his cd
collection, his DVDs, his books. He looks up at two World
War I swords that are crossed and mounted over the mantle.
Beneath the swords is a framed photograph of a WW I soldier.
Marcus sighs, then goes back to his task.
INT. CRACKHOUSE APARTMENT -- NIGHT
Carruthers opens a chest of drawers.
RAY

I don't know where she came from.

Just wandered in one day like a stray

dog. Acted like she owned the place.
Carruthers closes the drawer.

INT. VICTOR'S OFFICE -- NIGHT

Caroline opens a file cabinet. She's looking for something.
No luck. She opens another.

INT. MARCUS'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT
Marcus packs his clothes into a suitcase.
INT. CRACKHOUSE APARTMENT -- NIGHT

Carruthers opens the drawers in the kitchen area.
31.

RAY
You sure you're not a cop?

CARRUTHERS
I'm not a cop.

RAY
You used to be, though. Didn't you?

Carruthers looks at him, but doesn't answer. He continues
searching the place.

INT. VICTOR'S OFFICE -- NIGHT

Victor begins to regain consciousness. He finds himself
flat on his back, spread-eagle on his desk, his wrists and
ankles tied securely to the legs of the desk.

Caroline is crouched near the file cabinet. She reads a
file. She notices him. She takes the file and puts it in
her purse.

VICTOR
What is that? What do you have?

CAROLINE
You don't believe in the supernatural,
do you, Mr. Carruthers? I tried to
communicate with you, but you just
wouldn't see me. You've put me
through a lot of work.

VICTOR
What do you want with me?

CAROLINE
It's easy to slip into an occupied
body for a few seconds. Just to
make a point. But it's a lot harder
to find a vacancy. It's a very
competitive marketplace out there.

Caroline sees a family photograph on the bookshelf. Victor
has a wife and two kids.

CAROLINE (CONT'D)
Oh, look. Are those babies proud of
you? I bet they are. Of course,
they don't know what Daddy's been up
to, do they?

Victor tries to free himself. It's pointless.
CAROLINE (CONT'D)

I bet you make a lot of sacrifices
for your family, don't you?
32.
INT. CRACKHOUSE APARTMENT -- NIGHT

Carruthers looks on the bookshelves. There are no books.
Just trinkets, stones, chrystals. And a diverse collection
of knives: daggers, antique shivs, ceremonial blades.

RAY
She was into all kinds of shit.
Supernatural stuff, you know.
Witchcraft. Devil worship.

Carruthers picks up the most interesting knife. It has a
silver handle and a black, curved, snake-like blade.

INT. VICTOR'S OFFICE -- NIGHT

CAROLINE
There's one more sacrifice you need
to make.

VICTOR

What are you doing? What do you want?
Caroline opens the drawer. She finds a long, sharp gold
letter opener. She puts the letter opener between her teeth
and she crawls up on top of him. She tears his shirt open.
INT. MARCUS'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT
Marcus opens the closet. He pulls out his shirts. He finds
a suitcoat. A black suitcoat, and pants. He holds them up
to his body and looks in the mirror.
INT. CRACKHOUSE APARTMENT -- NIGHT

RAY

You know "the hooker with a heart of

gold" thing? Well, that wasn't this

one. She was one cold, dirty bitch.
Carruthers finds a row of half-used candles, and a pendant.

INT. VICTOR'S OFFICE -- NIGHT

Caroline opens her dark, almost black, lipstick. She begins
to draw something on his chest with the lipstick.

CAROLINE
It's a dangerous game you're playing,
Vic. There's something you need to
know...I always win.
INT. CRACKHOUSE APARTMENT -- NIGHT

Carruthers holds up the pendant. It's a pentagram.
33.
INT. VICTOR'S OFFICE -- NIGHT

Caroline finishes her lipstick drawing. She has made a red
pentagram on Vic's chest.

VICTOR
What do you want? You want money?
I'll give you whatever you want.

Caroline tears a piece of duct tape. She rubs her ass on
his mid-section, as if trying to arouse him.

CAROLINE
I just want one tiny little
insignificant thing.

VICTOR
What?

She puts the tape over his mouth. He fights for breath.

CAROLINE
Your life.

Caroline raises the letter opener over her head. Victor's
eyes go wide. She plunges the blade into his chest.

INT. CRACKHOUSE APARTMENT -- NIGHT

Carruthers shows Ray the pendant.

CARRUTHERS
You mind if I take this?
RAY
She don't need it anymore. You done?

I got things.

CARRUTHERS
Sure.

Carruthers steps out. Ray closes the door.
INT. VICTOR'S OFFICE -- NIGHT
Caroline looks into Victor's eyes.
CAROLINE
You're a believer now, aren't you,

Mr. Carruthers?

He nods violently, in agony. Caroline laughs. Her face
changes. She becomes the demon.

EXT. CEMETERY -- MORNING

CLOSE ON CASKET.
34.

Marcus attends the graveside service. He is dressed in his
dark suit. There is a crowd of 50 in attendance. Several
HOMELESS PEOPLE linger at the outer edges.

CARLISLE
It's not hard to believe in the devil.
Just open your eyes. You see hell
all around us. What happened to
Emma makes it easy to believe in the
devil. But it makes it hard to keep
believing in God...Emma's goodness.
That's what I keep thinking about.
There's a reason to believe in God.

Marcus looks at Emma's mother, CHARLOTTE, a beautiful woman
in her mid 50's.

CARLISLE (CONT'D)
I'm tortured to think that if I were
stronger, if I were smarter, I could
have protected her...Evil exists,
brothers and sisters. And God's not
always going to protect us. He didn't
protect Emma. That was our job.
We've got to get smarter. We've got
to get stronger. We've got to protect
the goodness that's still with us.

Marcus glances to a woman who walks on the outskirts of the
crowd. It is Emma. She passes behind one of the mourners,
and is gone. Confused, Marcus looks for her. But she doesn't
reappear.

CARLISLE (CONT'D)
Maybe we should pray a little less,
and work a little more. Fight a
little more, to make this world the
kind of place where our Emmas are
safe...the kind of place, I think,
that it has never been.

EXT. LINDSAY'S HOUSE -- DAY

Carruthers knocks on the door of a small, run-down house in
a shitty part of town. A woman, LINDSAY, 57, answers. Her
manner is not rude, but certainly not welcoming.

LINDSAY
Yes?

CARRUTHERS
Ma'am. My name is John Carruthers.
I'm investigating the death of your
daughter, Elizabeth...May I speak
with you for a moment?
35.

INT. LINDSAY'S HOUSE -- DAY

Carruthers, a file open on his knees, sits in the small,
dark house. Lindsay brings him a glass of water. The water
has a brown tint to it. He notices, and doesn't drink.

She sits.

CARRUTHERS
Thank you, ma'am.

LINDSAY
Most people would have called first.

CARRUTHERS
I'm sorry. I didn't have your number.

LINDSAY
It's in the book. I work nights. I
sleep during the day.

CARRUTHERS
I'm sorry.

CARRUTHERS (CONT'D)
And I'm very sorry about what happened
to Elizabeth.

Lindsay shrugs.

CARRUTHERS (CONT'D)
The police have told me that you
refused to identify her body.

LINDSAY
I didn't want to see my daughter
when she was alive. Why would I
want to see her dead?

CARRUTHERS
When was the last time you spoke
with your daughter?

LINDSAY
Four years ago.

Carruthers is suprised. Lindsay unbuttons the top button of
her blouse. She pulls it aside a few inches, revealing a
thick, jagged scar over her left breast.

LINDSAY (CONT'D)
She did it, in my sleep. We argued
over something. Don't remember what.
She said she was going to kill me...I
didn't--I couldn't believe that she
meant it.
36.

CARRUTHERS
I'm sorry. I don't have any record
of this.

LINDSAY

She didn't do jail time. She was
sixteen years old. She went to the
state hospital. They let her out
after a year. She took off two days
later. She said that if I ever gave
her a reason, she would come back
and finish the job. I believed her
that time.

Lindsay takes a cigarette from its pack. She offers one to
Carruthers. He takes it. She lights her cigarette, then
hands him the lighter.

LINDSAY (CONT'D)
At the hospital, they called her a,
um, a sociopath. Somebody who doesn't
see other people as...people, you
know. They're like things to her.
Playthings. Inconveniences.

Carruthers lights the cigarette.

LINDSAY (CONT'D)
It's good she's dead. That paramedic
they're trying to blame. They ought
to give him a medal as far as I'm
concerned. They're afraid I'm going
to sue. I'm not going to sue anybody.
The night after she died...I haven't
slept that well in years.

EXT. LINDSAY'S HOUSE -- DAY
Lindsay walks Carruthers to his car. He opens the door.

LINDSAY
You know, she wasn't always that
way. As a little girl, she was real
sweet. Then she got bad sick when
she was 14. Fevers...she even died
for a few minutes. Her heart failed.
They brought her back, but she was
never the same. She was mean. Dark,
you know. It's like the fever did
something to her brain. My little
girl died when she was 14. This
whore you're talking to me about...she
was nothing to me.

A woman watches from the opposite side of the street. She
is partly obscured by one of the large trees that line the
road, but we see a part of her face. It is Caroline.
37.

Carruthers starts his car. He drives away. Lindsay watches
him go. She sees Caroline across the street, but she does
not know her. Lindsay walks back toward her house. Caroline
doesn't move. A man approaches, walking two Rottweiler dogs.
The man is bearded and wears wire rimmed glasses with small
circular lenses. His hair and clothing are wild and rumpled.
This is MARTINEAU, 42.

The dogs begin to growl and bark at Caroline. Martineau
does his best to hold them back.

MARTINEAU
I'm sorry. They're usually not--

The dogs look like they want to tear her apart. Caroline
gives the man and his dogs a cold look. She starts away.

The dogs settle. Martineau watches Caroline go.

EXT. EMMA'S HOUSE -- DAY

Several people from the funeral linger in and around Emma's
house. It is an old brick home, built in the 1920's. Marcus
climbs the front steps, and enters.

INT. EMMA'S HOUSE -- DAY

Marcus pours himself a cup of red punch. Carlisle stands in
the kitchen doorway with Charlotte. He sees Marcus and gives
him a welcoming smile. Marcus nods to him and puts a couple
of cookies on his plate.

INT. CARRUTHER'S OFFICE BLDG. HALLWAY -- DAY

Carruthers approaches the door to his office. He's surprised
that it's locked. He unlocks it.

INT. EMMA'S HOUSE -- DAY

Marcus tries the door to the bathroom. It's locked.

INT. EMMA'S UPSTAIRS HALLWAY -- DAY

Marcus climbs the stairs. He sees a bathroom at the end of
the hall. He starts toward it. As he passes, he looks into
one of the bedrooms. It is clearly Emma's. The bed is made,
the curtains are open.

He stops in the doorway. He sees a small writing desk near
the window. Several volumes of a diary are neatly stacked
on the desk.

INT. CARRUTHER'S RECEPTION ROOM -- DAY

Carruthers enters. He starts toward his office. He looks at
Victor's door. It is crawling with flies.
38.

CARRUTHERS
What the hell?

INT. VICTOR'S OFFICE -- DAY

Carruthers pushes the door open and scatters a cloud of flies.
He enters, then stops dead in his tracks.

Victor lies disemboweled on the desk. Caroline has painted
the walls with his innards. Written in blood across the
wall are the words:

VENGEANCE IS MINE!
INT. EMMA'S BEDROOM -- DAY

Marcus stands at Emma's desk. He opens one of her diaries.
On the first page is Emma's photo.

There is a soft knock on the door. He looks up. Emma's
mother, Charlotte, stands in the doorway.

MARCUS
Oh. Excuse me. I'm so sorry.

CHARLOTTE
It's alright. I know we all...want
to be close to her again. Somehow.

He stands there awkwardly. He doesn't know what to say.

CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)
Did you go to school with her?

MARCUS
No, ma'am...I--I met her at the
shelter.

CHARLOTTE

Do you read Spanish?
INT. EMMA'S BEDROOM -- DAY

Marcus and Charlotte sit in the window seat. Emma's diaries
are between them.

CHARLOTTE
She kept a diary. Every day...I--
I've been trying to read it, trying
to find some reason for what happened.

Marcus turns a page. The writing is in Spanish.

CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)
Her father was from Argentina. He
taught her, before he died.

(MORE)
39.
CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)
Every entry...is a letter to him. I--
I can't read Spanish.

MARCUS
Where do you want me to start?

Charlotte nods to the book in his hand. He looks down.

MARCUS (CONT'D)

(reading)
"Dear Papa, today there was an
earthquake in Peru. I saw pictures

of a man holding his little boy who
had died. The little boy's legs
were covered with blood."

INT. VICTOR'S OFFICE -- DAY

Carruthers sits outside Vic's door as POLICE OFFICERS swarm
the office. A PHOTOGRAPHER photographs Vic's body.

MARCUS (V.O.)
"You could see the pain in the
father's face. Pain so deep it will
never go away."

A DETECTIVE transcribes the writing on the wall. He sees
Vic's discarded innards, his heart, on the floor. A POLICEMAN
dusts the open file cabinet for fingerprints.

MARCUS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
"I know the boy is in a better place.
I won't pray for him tonight."

A woman approaches. We recognize her from the family photo.
It is Vic's wife, ROSIE. She sees the police and starts to
lose it. Carruthers immediately rises and grabs her. She
screams. He pulls her close. She sobs into his chest.

MARCUS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
"I'll pray for his father. And his
mother, wherever she is."

Vic's children, MICAH, 7, and CHANDRA, 5, walk toward them
in the hallway. Carruthers leads Rosie toward them.

MICAH
Grandpa.

CARRUTHERS
C'mon, babies. We got to go.

CHANDRA
I want to go to Daddy's office.
40.

CARRUTHERS
Not today, honey. C'mon now. We
got to go.

INT. EMMA'S BEDROOM -- DAY
Camille wipes a tear from her face.
MARCUS (V.O.)
(reading)
"And his brothers and sisters.

All of those who loved him and who
are hurting so bad tonight."

INT. CARRUTHER'S OFFICE BLDG. HALLWAY -- DAY

Carruthers leads Rosie and the children back to the stairs.
He passes a cop, FRANK, 47, at the top of the stairs.

CARRUTHERS
Frank, I can't stay. Will you...?

FRANK
I'll take care of everything. I'll
let you know what we find. John,
God. I'm sorry. Vic was a good man.

CARRUTHERS
Thank you.

Carruthers starts down the stairs with Rosie and the kids.
CARRUTHERS (CONT'D)
(to Rosie)
Vic backs up his laptop at the house,
right?
She nods, fighting emotion.

CARRUTHERS (CONT'D)
I've got to get into those files.

EXT. MARCUS'S HOUSE -- EVENING

Ed exits Marcus's house. He slams the door behind him.
Carla immediately follows. She is hysterical.

CARLA
No! Come back here!

ED
You're out of your goddamn mind!

He goes to his car. She grabs him.

CARLA
Please! Don't leave me!
41.

ED
Get your hands off me! Are you crazy?

He pushes her back. She falls on the front lawn, and sobs.
ED (CONT'D)
Cutting yourself. What the hell is

wrong with you?

CARLA
Don't leave me...

ED
You're out of your goddamn mind.

He starts the car. He drives away. Carla sobs on the front
lawn. A NEIGHBOR woman has stopped on the sidewalk. She
watches.

CARLA
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT?!

The neighbor turns away, and goes.
EXT. CEMETERY -- EVENING

Marcus approaches Emma's grave. He puts a flower at the
base of the mound of dirt.

MARCUS
I only knew you for twenty minutes...
And you were the best person I've
ever known.

Marcus's cell phone rings. He looks at the phone. Carla is
calling. He decides to take the call.

MARCUS (CONT'D)

Hello.

CARLA (V.O.)
Marcus?

MARCUS
Yeah.

INT. MARCUS'S BATHROOM -- EVENING
Carla is at the bathroom mirror, with the telephone.

CARLA
Goodbye.

She hangs up.
42.
EXT. CEMETERY -- EVENING

MARCUS
Carla?

INT. MARCUS'S BATHROOM -- EVENING

Carla, weeping, raises a handful of pills to her mouth. She
washes them down with a glass of water. The phone begins to
ring.

EXT. CEMETERY -- EVENING

Marcus, the phone to his ear, walks quickly toward his car.
The phone is ringing, but there's no answer.

MARCUS
Dammit.

He gets into his car.
INT. MARCUS'S CAR -- EVENING

Marcus speeds down the road. He's on the phone.

MARCUS
Jen, it's me. Get over to the house.
It's Carla.
INT. AMBULANCE -- EVENING
Jenny is on the phone. Shawn is driving.
JENNY

(into phone)
What? Are you sure?

EXT. CEMETERY -- EVENING
MARCUS
I'M SURE. GO! NOW!
INT. AMBULANCE -- EVENING
JENNY

Okay. We're on it.
Shawn turns the ambulance around.
INT. MARCUS'S HOUSE -- EVENING
Marcus bursts into the house.

MARCUS
Carla!
43.

He goes immediately toward the bathroom. He finds Carla.
She has collapsed on the hallway floor.

He rolls her over. She's unconscious. He slaps her face.
She mumbles, but doesn't open her eyes. He drags her to the
bathroom.

INT. MARCUS'S BATHROOM -- EVENING

Marcus drags Carla to the toilet. He grabs the empty bottle
of pills on the counter and reads the label. He angrily
throws the bottle.

MARCUS
Come on, Carla. Wake up for me.

He bends her over the toilet and he forces two fingers down
her throat. She chokes, gags, then vomits into the toilet.

MARCUS (CONT'D)
There you go. That's a good girl.

He gags her again. She vomits again. Shawn and Jenny appear
in the doorway.

SHAWN
What did she do?

MARCUS
It's alright. I got her in time.

JENNY
(sees the pill bottle)
We taking her in?

MARCUS
Give me the kit. Hold her up.

INT. MARCUS'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

Carla lies in the bed. She is lethargic, but conscious.
Marcus sits at her side. Jenny's in the doorway.

JENNY
I think we ought to take her in.

CARLA
(softly, to Marcus)
If you let them put me in the psych
unit, I'll finish it. I swear to
God I will.

Jen leaves the room.

MARCUS
It's alright. It's gonna be alright.
44,
INT. MARCUS'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
Jen stops in the hallway, at the bathroom door. Shawn sits
on the edge of the tub. He has cleaned up the mess. He
looks up at her.

JENNY
He deserves a lot better.

Shawn silently, reluctantly, agrees. Jenny walks away.
INT. GRANDKIDS' BEDROOM -- NIGHT

Carruthers tucks his grandkids into bed.

CHANDRA

Grandpa, can you sleep over tonight?
CARRUTHERS

I'm not going anywhere. I promise.

INT. VIC'S DEN -- AFTERNOON

Carruthers scans files in Vic's home office. He looks at
Vic's calendar, his schedule of meetings.

He stops momentarily to look at his son's photograph on the
desk. We see another photograph, Vic on a bowling team with
Geoff, the man who jumped to his death.

INT. LINDSAY'S HOUSE -- AFTERNOON

Lindsay, the dead hooker's mother, is dressed in her
nightgown. She pours herself a cup of hot water. We see
her through the kitchen doorway, as if we are spying on her.
She puts a tea bag into the water, then some sugar.

INT. LINDSAY'S BATHROOM -- AFTERNOON

Lindsay washes her face at the bathroom sink. The mirror on
the medicine cabinet is open a few inches.

She lifts her head and dries her face on a towel. She looks
at herself in the mirror. She notices that the mirror is a
little askew. She reaches to correct it.

She closes the cabinet door. And we see...that there was
nothing waiting behind her.

INT. LINDAY'S BEDROOM -- AFTERNOON

Lindsay sits on the edge of her bed and finishes her tea.
She lies down. She takes a black cloth eye mask from the
night stand and puts it on. As the black cloth covers her
eyes, we are left in total darkness.
45.
In the darkness, we hear only Lindsay's tired breathing and
the slight rustle of the sheets as she moves. We hear the
creak of a floorboard. Lindsay's calm breathing continues.
She does not seem alarmed.
Then we hear the creak of the springs on the bed. Lindsay's
breathing stops. She utters a small, odd questioning sound.
As she takes off the eye mask, we see what she sees:

Caroline is kneeling over her. She holds a large kitchen
knife over her head in both hands.

CAROLINE
Hi, mom.

And she brings the knife down.
INT. VIC'S DEN -- NIGHT

Carruthers continues to work at Vic's computer. He's now
looking at case files. His cell phone rings.

CARRUTHERS
Carruthers.

INT. POLICE PRECINCT -- NIGHT

Frank, the cop, walks down the hall and talks into his cell
phone.

INTERCUT WITH INT. VIC'S DEN.

FRANK
The prints match a lady named Caroline
Kuntz. You know her?

CARRUTHERS

No.

Rosie steps into the doorway and looks at Carruthers. Her
face is puffy from crying. She wears a robe, and she's
holding a glass of water.

FRANK
Nothing in the criminal database.
But we found her in the state employee
file. She's single. Elemenary school
teacher. Lives in Midvale.

CARRUTHERS
(to Rosie, covering
the phone)

You know a Caroline Kuntz?

She shakes her head.
46.

FRANK
Here's where it really gets weird.
This Kuntz lady is at a PTA meeting
two nights ago. She has some kind
of seizure.

Rosie puts a pill in her mouth. She washes it down.

FRANK (CONT'D)
Freaks everybody out. Ambulance
comes, they take her away, she flat-—
lines. She's dead for, like, four
minutes. They bring her back. They
take her to the hospital, put her in
a bed, and she disappears.

CARRUTHERS
Disappears?

FRANK
She takes down a nurse and a janitor
and then just walks out of the
hospital. They got it on
surveillance. Nobody's seen her since.

CARRUTHERS
Why would a schoolteacher want to
kill Vic?

FRANK

We're talking to her friends, family.
The really weird thing is, before

two nights ago, this woman was Mother
Teresa.

Carruthers watches Rosie take another pill. At the precinct,
an OFFICE COP hands Frank a file.

FRANK (CONT'D)
John, I gotta go.

CARRUTHERS
Thanks.
(hangs up. To Rosie...)
On Vic's calendar, he had appointments
with a Father Vernon. Every other
day for the past two weeks. You
know what that's about?

ROSIE
I don't.

INT. MARCUS'S BEDROOM -- EVENING

Marcus lies in bed with Carla. They are both awake. She
lies with her back to him. He rises.
47.
INT. MARCUS'S KITCHEN -- EVENING

Marcus, at the kitchen counter, pours himself a glass of
whiskey. This time he drinks it. And he pours himself
another.

INT. VIC'S DEN -- NIGHT

Carruthers has the newspaper article about Geoff's death
open on the computer. He compares the photo to the bowling
photo on Vic's desk. He sighs. He opens a case file named,
simply, "Geoff."

Rosie is asleep on the office couch. She stirs, but doesn't
wake. Carruthers reads the file.

CARRUTHERS
Vic...what the hell were you playing
with?

INT. CATHEDRAL -- DAY

Carruthers walks down the center aisle of a beautiful Catholic
cathedral. He doesn't stop to genuflect.

There are a half dozen WOMEN scattered in the aisles, praying.
A priest, FATHER VERNON, 52, is lighting candles. Carruthers
approaches.

CARRUTHERS
Father Vernon.

FATHER VERNON
Yes?

CARRUTHERS
(extends his hand)
John Carruthers. Victor was my son.

Vernon's expression immediately softens with compassion.
INT. CATHEDRAL HALL -- DAY

Carruthers and Father Vernon sit on a pew in a long
administrative hallway of the cathedral.

CARRUTHERS
I have a pretty good idea what
happened. I just need you to fill
in the blanks.

FATHER VERNON
What is said in my confessional will
remain in the confessional, even in
death.

(MORE)
48.

FATHER VERNON (CONT'D)
(he hands Carruthers
a letter)
Your son asked me to give this to
you, in the event of his passing. I
expect it will answer many of your
questions.

Carruthers looks at the letter.

FATHER VERNON (CONT'D)
You were hired to investigate the
death of the prostitute.

CARRUTHERS
Elizabeth Markham. Yes.

FATHER VERNON
Victor felt it wasn't a coincidence.
It was God's justice. Finding him.
(A moment, then...)
Victor's sins were very great. He
was afraid...he was convinced...that
he had lost his soul.

INT. CATHEDRAL -- DAY
Carruthers sits in a pew near the back of the cathedral. He
reads Vic's letter. He wipes tears from his face. Father

Vernon watches from a doorway near the front. He turns away,
and exits, leaving Carruthers alone in the cathedral.

EXT. MARCUS'S HOUSE -- DAY
Jenny and Shawn pound on Marcus's front door.

SHAWN
C'mon. Open the door.

Marcus opens. Some time has passed since we last saw him.
He's a mess. He hasn't shaved in days. His white t-shirt
is no longer white.

MARCUS
Hey.

JENNY
Hey, yourself.

SHAWN
We're here to congratulate you.

INT. MARCUS'S HOUSE -- MORNING

Shawn and Jenny enter the house. Marcus closes the door
behind them.
JENNY
In case you haven't heard...you're
off suspension.

MARCUS
Suspension.

SHAWN
Yeah. Remember? The dead hooker.
Ring any bells?

JENNY
It stinks in here. Somebody turn on
the lights.

SHAWN

As soon as Henderson got word that
the family wasn't gonna sue, he
decided not to continue the
investigation. Imagine that.

Marcus turns on the light. The place is a goddamn mess.

There are beer and whiskey bottles everywhere.

JENNY
Just what the hell have you been
doing in here?

MARCUS
Translating. I got a translating
job.

He motions to the table. Emma's journals are open,
a half-empty whiskey bottle.

JENNY
So do you eat anything anymore or
just...?

Shawn steps into the doorway to the bedroom. Carla is in

bed, her back to us.

SHAWN
Hey, Carla. How you feeling?

She's awake, but she doesn't answer. Shawn turns away.

MARCUS
I know what it looks like. We're
just...going through some stuff.

JENNY
Going through some brain cells, that's
for sure.
50.

MARCUS
Look, it's really none of anybody's
goddamn business.

JENNY
Oookay.

SHAWN
Leave him alone, girl. A man's gotta
do what a man's gotta do.

JENNY
Well, a man's gotta take a shower
eventually.

SHAWN
Yeah, we gotta get your ass cleaned
up, man. Parker quit yesterday
so...you can take his shift if you
want. Starts at three.

MARCUS
Three?

JENNY
If you want it.

MARCUS
Yeah. I want it.

SHAWN
Alright! The man is back on the
job!

JENNY

(to Shawn)

You throw him in the shower.
I'll...turn the hose on this place.

INT. MARCUS'S BEDROOM -- DAY

cleaned up and back in uniform, sits on the edge of

MARCUS
If you need me, just call.

Carla doesn't respond.

MARCUS (CONT'D)
I gotta go.

He starts to rise. She quickly turns and grabs his arm.
Her eyes are full of fear, despair.
51.

MARCUS (CONT'D)
It's just one shift. I'll take my
cell...I gotta go.

EXT. MARCUS'S HOUSE -- DAY
Marcus gets in Jenny's car. Shawn is in the back seat.

JENNY
It's the house of the dead in there.
You realize that.

Marcus looks at the house. He sighs. Jenny starts the engine.
INT. CRACKHOUSE -- EVENING

Carruthers knocks, then waits at a door. He's dressed ina
dark suit. Ray opens.

CARRUTHERS
You and I need to talk.

RAY
We already talked.

He starts to close the door. Carruthers puts up a hand and
stops the door.

CARRUTHERS
I buried my boy this morning. I'm
in no mood to play games.

INT. RAY'S APT. -- NIGHT
Carruthers sits at Ray's dining table. This place is a dump.

CARRUTHERS
Eight days ago, a man named Geoff
Morgan took a dive off a building
downtown. Family man, good job. No
reason to kill himself.

Carruthers puts a photo on the table. It is the photo of
Vic and Geoff on the bowling team.

CARRUTHERS (CONT'D)
You know this man?

Ray shakes his head.

CARRUTHERS (CONT'D)
You're a liar. This man was a friend
of my son's, and he was one of your
customers. Lizzie Markham, your
hooker, was blackmailing him. He
borrowed $25,000 from my son, and he
paid her.
52.

RAY
I didn't blackmail anybody.

CARRUTHERS
She asked for more. He wouldn't pay
it. My son looked into things.
Then he made another withdrawal from
his bank account. $20,000. He didn't
give that to his friend. He didn't
give that to Lizzie Markham. He
paid that to you.

RAY
I said, I didn't blackmail--.

CARRUTHERS
My son paid you twenty thousand
dollars to make this problem go away.

Ray looks at him in disbelief.

CARRUTHERS (CONT'D)
My son hired you to kill Lizzie
Markham. You shot her full of bad
drugs.

RAY
You're out of your fucking mind.

Ray moves to get up. Carruthers rises, fast, and slams him
against the wall. He presses his forearm against Ray's
throat.

CARRUTHERS
Who killed my son?

We hear the sliding pump of a shotgun as someone loads a
shell into the chamber. Carruthers turns his head. A young
hooker, PETRA, 15, stands in the doorway, the shotgun ready.

RAY
Get out of my house.

EXT. CRACKHOUSE -- NIGHT

Carruthers gets into his car outside the crackhouse. He
looks up at the second floor window. Ray, shotgun in hand,
looks down at him.

CARRUTHERS
You're going down, asshole.

He starts the car, and pulls away.
53.
EXT. STRIP CLUB -- NIGHT

The ambulance waits, lights blazing, near the front door of
a strip club.

INT. STRIP CLUB -- NIGHT

Marcus and Jenny attend to a heavy-set 55 year-old man,
THOMAS. Thomas lies on the floor, on his back. A few club
patrons remain. Four STRIPPERS watch. They wear flimsy
robes. The D.J. checks his watch.

JENNY
Pulse is 150.

STRIPPER
I was just giving him a dance. Next
thing I know, he falls on the floor.

Jenny reads his blood pressure.

JENNY
Sixty over forty.

MARCUS
Alright, Thomas. We've got to get
you to a hospital. I think you're
having a little heart attack.

STRIPPER
I knew it.

THOMAS
Don't...tell my wife.

MARCUS
My job's just to keep that heart
working. If you can help me do that,
you can tell your wife whatever you
want. Is that a deal?

THOMAS
Deal.

JENNY
Thomas, I think this hobby's getting
a little dangerous for you. Maybe
you ought to take up golf.

Thomas gives her a confused look.

MARCUS
(to Jenny)
I've played golf. Doesn't quite
compare.
54.

EXT. CRACKHOUSE -- NIGHT
The car passes Josie, the hooker, who is standing at the
curb. A woman approaches slowly. Josie sees her. It is
Caroline.
CAROLINE
Hi.
JOSIE
Yeah?

Caroline looks at her, but doesn't speak.

JOSIE (CONT'D)
What're you looking at? You
somebody's wife?

CAROLINE
Oh no.

Josie turns her attention back to the street.

CAROLINE (CONT'D)
Josie.

JOSIE
How do you know my name?

CAROLINE
I'm looking for a date.

JOSIE
I don't do women.

Caroline produces a thick wad of cash. Josie decides that
maybe she does do women after all.

INT. CRACKHOUSE -- NIGHT

Josie leads Caroline up the stairs of the crackhouse. Ray
takes his place at the top of the stairs. He sits in a chair
next to Josie's door. Petra sits on his lap.

Josie gives Ray a few bills as she passes. Ray looks at
Caroline. Josie unlocks her door.

RAY
(to Josie)
How long?

CAROLINE
As long as it takes, Ray.

They enter, and close the door. Petra playfully tries to
grab the money.
55.

RAY
Greedy little bitch.

INT. JOSIE'S APT. -- NIGHT

Josie leads Caroline down a short hallway, past a small
bathroom, and into a bedroom. The apartment is pretty much
what you'd expect: orderly but with an air of decay. It is
furnished and decorated with a low-rent attempt at sensuality.

Caroline stops in the doorway. She takes off her coat.
Josie, at the bed, starts to unbutton her blouse.

CAROLINE
No. Let me do that.

INT. MARCUS'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

Carla sits up in bed. She looks around. She looks at the
clock: 11:24. She rises.

INT. MARCUS'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

Carla opens the drapes at the front window and looks out.
All is dark and quiet.

INT. BAR AND GRILL -- NIGHT

Marcus and Jenny are seated in a booth. They are drinking
soft drinks. A waitress approaches and delivers their food:
salads and ten-dollar hamburgers.

JENNY
Thanks.

Marcus pulls a folded up piece of paper from his pocket.

MARCUS

Just listen to this...

(reading)
"September 13...I don't know anybody
else my age who hasn't slept with
someone. Not anybody. Sometimes I
think there might be something wrong
with me. But I know that's the devil,
tempting me."

JENNY
Oh. Religious girl.

MARCUS
"I want to. Sometimes I want to so
bad I can hardly stand it. I want
to make love with Daniel--" That's a
guy she went out with a couple of
times. "But I know it isn't right.
(MORE)
56.

MARCUS (CONT'D)
I know he's not the right one. I
don't want to be a nun, but I won't
make love with any man who I wouldn't
want to be the father of my children."

JENNY
Good luck with that.

MARCUS
"I know I'll find him. I know I
will."

JENNY
Wow.

MARCUS
Amazing.

JENNY
She's dead.

MARCUS
Jen--

JENNY

No, listen to me. Alright, she was
an amazing woman. But she's dead.
She's cold and she's in the ground
and she's never coming back. Have
you ever known anybody who's come
back from the dead? Because, you
know, I haven't.

MARCUS
(a moment, then...)
I must be losing my mind.

JENNY
Well, you are starting to remind me
of Martineau.

MARCUS
Martineau's completely insane. I am
not completely insane. It's just--
I finally fall in love, I mean really
fall in love...and it's with a dead
girl.

JENNY
A crazy wife and a dead girlfriend.
This is just me talking, but...I
think maybe you should raise your
standards a little.
57.
INT. MARCUS'S BATHROOM -- NIGHT

Carla wears a white robe. She sits on the edge of the tub
and turns on the faucet.

She looks out, through the doorway, into the kitchen. A
small television on the counter plays DRACULA: PRINCE OF
DARKNESS starring Christopher Lee.

INT. JOSIE'S APT. -- NIGHT

Josie sits on the edge of the bed. Caroline kneels in front
of her. Josie slides off her shoes. Caroline reaches between
Josie's thighs, and unsnaps her stockings.

Caroline peels off Josie's stocking.

JOSIE
That's it, baby. Show me. You show
me how it's done.

CAROLINE
Don't talk.

INT. MARCUS'S BATHROOM -- NIGHT

Carla slides into the tub. She has moved the television to
the tiled ledge near the faucet. DRACULA still plays.

INT. JOSIE'S APT. -- NIGHT

Caroline kneels behind Josie on the bed. They are facing a
dressing table with a large round mirror.

Caroline unties Josie's blouse and pulls it over her head.
Josie closes her eyes, and tilts her head, exposing her neck.

Caroline picks up one of the discarded stockings. She wraps
each end around her fists. She gently lowers the stocking
over Josie's head.

Josie feels the stocking on her neck. She smiles. She opens
her eyes. Caroline smiles at her in the mirror. Josie sees
that she has wrapped each end of the stocking tightly around
her fists.

JOSIE
What--?

Caroline tightens. Josie reacts quickly. She gets three
fingers between the stocking and her neck as Caroline
tightens.

CAROLINE
I've come back for you, Josie.
58.
Josie fights. She thrashes, but can't get loose. She rises.
Caroline wraps her legs around Josie, and holds on for the
ride.
Josie spins and throws herself back, against the mirror. It
smashes. Caroline lets go, and falls. Josie staggers toward
the door as she pulls the stocking from her neck and gasps
for breath.

CAROLINE (CONT'D)
You trying to kill me again?

Josie turns for the door.
JOSIE
(her voice is hoarse)
Ray!
She starts down the hallway. Caroline rises.

INT. CRACKHOUSE -- NIGHT

Ray plays with the buttons on Petra's blouse. He hears Josie
scream. He jumps up. Petra falls onto the floor.

INT. JOSIE'S HALLWAY -- NIGHT
Josie rushes for the door.

JOSIE
Ray!

INT. CRACKHOUSE -- NIGHT

Ray gets to the apartment door. He tries the knob. The
door is locked.

RAY
Josie?

INT. JOSIE'S HALLWAY -- NIGHT

Josie runs for the door. Caroline enters the hallway, from
the bedroom. She pursues, but she doesn't follow the natural
rules of the universe as we know them.

She runs up the side of the wall. She scurries along the
ceiling, and then hangs upside down, her face between Josie
and the door.

Her face turns into the demon. Josie screams.

INT. CRACKHOUSE -- NIGHT

Ray steps back and kicks the door open. Caroline drops from
the ceiling and spins. Crouching, she hisses.
59.

CAROLINE
Did you miss me, Ray?

Ray staggers back, terrified. Caroline charges.

She pushes him back, over the railing. He falls three floors,
through the empty space between the stairs. He lands with a
sickening crack and a thud. Blood immediately pools around
his head.

Caroline turns to Petra. Josie runs deeper into her
apartment. She locks herself in the bathroom.

Caroline grabs Petra by the throat and slams her against the
wall. She seems undecided on whether to kill the girl. She
notices an emergency fire hose attached to the wall.

INT. CRACKHOUSE -- NIGHT

Caroline has tied the fire hose around Petra's neck. She
forces the girl toward the stair rail. Petra struggles.
Caroline throws her over the rail.

Below, an OLD WOMAN opens her apartment door and steps out
as the hose reaches it's maximum length. Petra's neck snaps.
Her body swings and her face spins toward the old woman.

The old woman screams.

Caroline goes back into Josie's apartment.
INT. JOSIE'S BATHROOM -- NIGHT

Josie freaks out in the bathroom. The only lock is a tiny,
old-fashioned slide lock under the knob.

She pushes back the sliding glass door on the shower, but
the shower window is way too small. She would never get
through it. She's trapped.

INT. JOSIE'S HALLWAY -- NIGHT

Caroline tries the knob on the bathroom door. She jiggles
it. She pushes on the door.

CAROLINE
I thought we were friends, Josie.
But then you killed me. It's not
nice...to kill your friends.

Caroline looks through the keyhole.
CAROLINE (CONT'D)

Josie, sweetie. Now you're just
being rude. Don't you like me?
60.
INT. JOSIE'S BATHROOM -- NIGHT
Josie searches the medicine cabinet for something, anything.
She finds a metal nail file. Too flimsy, too small. She

finds a can of hair spray.

She looks down at an unused candle near the sink, and a cheap
cigarette lighter next to it.

She tears the top off the hair spray. She grabs the lighter.
She flicks it. It doesn't light.

INT. JOSIE'S HALLWAY -- NIGHT
Caroline pulls on the door, hard.

CAROLINE
I want you to apologize.

She kicks at the door. It almost opens, but doesn't.
CAROLINE (CONT'D)
You're going to apologize. If it's
the last thing you do.
She kicks it hard. The door flies open. Caroline puts on
her demon face as Josie sprays the hair spray and flicks the
lighter. This time...it works.

The lighter ignites the hair spray. A blast of fire engulfs

Caroline's face. She screams. Her face burns, but she
doesn't back away. She hangs her head, her hands on her
face. Her screams become moans, her moans become...laughter.

She looks up at Josie. One of her eyelids has burned away.
Her face has already begun to blister. She laughs.

CAROLINE (CONT'D)
Stupid bitch! You can't KILL ME!

She reaches out for Josie. Josie fights. She isn't ready
to give up. She scratches at Caroline's face. Caroline
howls and throws her against the sink and medicine cabinet.
The glass breaks, cutting Josie's back.

In excruciating pain, Josie lifts her legs. She gets her
feet on Caroline's chest. She kicks, hard, with her legs.

Caroline flies back and crashes through the glass shower
door. She falls into the tub. She doesn't get up. Her
legs hang over the edge. They jerk once, then again.

Josie approaches. She looks into the tub.
Caroline lies on her back. A huge shard of glass has sliced

into her neck. Blood pours, pulsates, from her neck. Her
eyes are blank. Her body, dying, quivers.
61.

Josie backs away from the tub. Behind her, in the medicine
cabinet, most of the broken mirror is still intact. She
turns toward the cabinet, and sees the demon face in the
shattered mirror. She screams and spins around. There is
no one there.

She backs into the hallway, slides down into a sitting
position against the wall, and sobs.

INT. MARCUS'S BATHROOM -- NIGHT

Carla soaks in a tub full of bubbles. She watches the small
television.

She hears a car. She reaches for her robe.
EXT. MARCUS'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

Jenny stops the car in Marcus's driveway. They both look at
the house. He doesn't get out.

JENNY
You sure you want to go in there?
We could go back to my place for a
while.

MARCUS
And then what?

Jenny gives a small shrug. He knows what she's suggesting.

MARCUS (CONT'D)
Jen...you're my best friend...

JENNY
Sometimes that works out.

She puts a hand on his thigh. He doesn't move away.

MARCUS
I think the odds would be against
us.
She moves toward him.
JENNY

The odds are always against us. We
always beat the odds.

MARCUS
Always?

JENNY
Almost always.

She kisses him. He kisses her back.
62.
INT. MARCUS'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

Carla is at the window, in her robe. She sees Marcus kissing
Jenny. She turns away.

EXT. MARCUS'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
Marcus pulls away, slowly. Jenny opens her eyes.

MARCUS
I gotta go.

He gets out of the car.

JENNY
Marcus...

MARCUS
What?

JENNY

That was a good kiss.

MARCUS
World class.

He closes the door. He starts toward the house. Jenny
watches him go, then pulls out of the driveway.

INT. MARCUS'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

Marcus enters the house. It is dark, except for the lights
in the bathroom and bedroom. He goes toward the bathroom.

MARCUS
Carla.

She doesn't answer. He looks into the bathroom. She's back
in the tub.

MARCUS (CONT'D)
Hey. You're out of bed. That's
good.
She looks at him, but doesn't speak.

MARCUS (CONT'D)
I'm gonna get out of my uniform.

She doesn't respond. He goes.
INT. MARCUS'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

Marcus takes off his shirt. He puts on an undershirt.
63.
INT. MARCUS'S BATHROOM -- NIGHT

Carla watches the television. She picks up the belt from
her robe. She flicks it at the television. The belt falls
into the water.

She tries it again. This time, filled with water, it slaps
the television. She leans forward. She wraps the belt around
the television.

She leans back. She holds one end of the belt in each hand.
It is wrapped around the back of the television. She pulls
on it. The television inches forward, toward the edge.

She watches, her face emotionless. She pulls on it again.
The edge of the television slides to the edge of the bathtub.
She stares at the television.

Marcus enters. He sees the television, the belt, Carla.

MARCUS
Carla?

She turns to him, without expression.

MARCUS (CONT'D)
Babe?

She pulls on the belt with both hands. The television tips,
then falls into the water.

MARCUS (CONT'D)
No!

The television explodes on impact. Carla jerks and shivers
and thrashes in the water. The lights in the house flicker
and then fail.

Marcus yanks the cord out of the wall. He pulls Carla from
the tub and lays her on the floor. She is unconscious.

He checks her pulse. Nothing. He tilts her head back and
breathes into her mouth. He pushes on her chest.

He grabs his cell phone.
MARCUS (CONT'D)
Shawn, she's done it! Carla's done
it. I need you at the house. Now!

INT. AMBULANCE STATION -- NIGHT

Shawn walks briskly toward the ambulance. Jackson, the bald
EMT, is already in the driver's seat.
64.
SHAWN
(into cell phone)
Hold on, man! We're on our way!

INT. MARCUS'S BATHROOM -- NIGHT

Shawn and Jackson arrive with a kit and a portable
defibrillator.

MARCUS
Give me the bag!

Jackson hands it over.

SHAWN
She breathing?

MARCUS
No.

SHAWN
Any pulse?

MARCUS
No.

Shawn turns on the defibrillator.

SHAWN
How long?

MARCUS
Four minutes. A little more.

(positions the patches)
Clear.

Shawn hits her with the electricity. She settles. Shawn
checks the monitor.

SHAWN
Nothing.

Marcus takes the defibrillator.

MARCUS
Clear!

He hits her again. She settles. He checks her pulse.

MARCUS (CONT'D)
Nothing. Damn it!

SHAWN
One more time.

MARCUS
C'mon, Carla. Get back here.
65.
He hits her. He checks her pulse. He breathes into her
mouth. He pushes on her chest. This woman is not coming
back.

MARCUS (CONT'D)
COME ON!

Marcus takes the defibrillator.

SHAWN
It's done, man. She's gone.

Marcus hits her again. Her body arches, settles, then moves.
She coughs.

MARCUS
Get her in the ambulance. Now!

JACKSON
Holy shit.

Dazed, Carla looks at Marcus.
MARCUS
We've got you. You're gonna be
alright.

Carla looks at Marcus.

CARLA
Marcus...

INT. AMBULANCE -- NIGHT
The ambulance races toward the hospital. Jackson drives
like a bat out of hell. Shawn is in the back with Marcus

and Carla.

Carla has an oxygen mask on. Marcus finishes putting in an
I.V. She tries to take off her mask.

MARCUS
No, baby. You need to keep that on.

She tries anyway. He helps her take it off.
MARCUS (CONT'D)
What is it? You want to say
something.

CARLA
Marcus...

MARCUS
Yeah. What is it, babe?

She lightly squeezes his hand.
66.

CARLA
I...love you.

She is looking at him with an expression we've never seen on
her face. There is something so beautifully peaceful in her
expression.

Shawn looks away. Marcus, confused, stares at Carla.

INT. EMERGENCY ROOM -- NIGHT

Marcus and Shawn lead Carla's gurney toward the O.R. They
are met by the E.R. CREW, Dr. Rollins included.

Marcus holds Carla's hand.

ROLLINS
This the suicide?

SHAWN
T.V. in the bathtub.

MARCUS
She was gone. We brought her back.

ROLLINS
You are one lucky lady.
(to Marcus)
We got her.

MARCUS
I'm going with her.

ROLLINS
Not after last time.

Shawn takes his arm.

SHAWN
Don't...It's his wife.

INT. E.R. EXAMINATION ROOM -- NIGHT

Rollins and a nurse work on Carla. They check her blood
pressure. They examine the burns on her chest.

Marcus sits in a chair nearby. He stares at the floor in
disbelief. He looks up at Carla. She looks at him, with
calm affection.

INT. BAR -- NIGHT

Carruthers is at the bar, drinking a Guinness, when his cell
phone rings. He answers.

CARRUTHERS
Yeah.
67.
INT. JOSIE'S HALLWAY -- NIGHT
Frank, the cop, paces in Josie's hallway.
INTERCUT WITH INT. BAR.
FRANK

It's Frank. We found the school
teacher. What's left of her.

CARRUTHERS
Where are you?
FRANK
A crackhouse on Second South.
CARRUTHERS
700 block.
FRANK

Yeah. How'd you know?

CARRUTHERS
I'll be right over.

Carruthers slaps some money on the bar, and exits.
INT. CARLA'S HOSPITAL ROOM -- NIGHT

Marcus sits on the edge of Carla's bed. He holds her hand.
She looks at him lovingly.

MARCUS
I don't understand.

CARLA
Your wife...she's dead. You
understand that, don't you?

He nods. She pulls him into an embrace.

CARLA (CONT'D)
It's alright.

MARCUS
Emma...

CARLA
It's alright. We're together now.
Everything will be alright.

INT. CRACKHOUSE -- NIGHT
Carruthers enters. Frank is waiting to meet him. They pass

Ray's uncovered body on their way up the stairs. A CORONER
pokes at the body.
68.

FRANK
Let him through. He's with me.
(to Carruthers)
There's the first one.

Carruthers looks down at Ray's broken head as he climbs the
stairs. They pass Petra's hanging body. A police
PHOTOGRAPHER snaps photos of the corpse.

INT. CRACKHOUSE APARTMENT -- NIGHT

Carruthers looks through the bathroom doorway. He sees
Caroline's corpse in the tub. He turns back to Frank in the
hallway.

FRANK
And that right there is the end of
the story. We don't know why she
went on the rampage, but...she ain't
walking out the door this time.

Carruthers hears Josie's voice. He looks into her room.
She's on the bed, talking to a COP. A PARAMEDIC is trying
to sedate her.

JOSIE
That wasn't no schoolteacher! It
was her! It was Lizzie! I could
see it in her eyes. In her...voice.

The things she said. It was her. I
know it was her!

FRANK
(to Carruthers)
She claims the woman climbed on the
walls, like a spider. Freaky stuff.
We're gonna get her to take a blood
test. Gotta see what's floating
around in there.

Carruthers looks back to Caroline's body.
INT. CARLA'S HOSPITAL ROOM -- MORNING

Marcus sits on Carla's bed. They are sharing Carla's hospital
breakfast.

CARLA
It was so strange. It was like I
fell asleep, in the ambulance, looking
at you. I didn't want to go, but I
was so tired...and then when I woke
up, there you were again. You were
the first thing I saw.

MARCUS
Do you remember anything in between?
69.

CARLA
You mean like a tunnel or heaven or
anything? No. It's like I was
dreaming. I just remember this
feeling, wanting to come back.

Lathrop, the administrator, knocks on the door.

LATHROP
Excuse me. Mr. Galan. There are
some papers for you to sign at the
nurse's station.

INT. HOSPITAL NURSE'S STATION -- MORNING
Marcus is at the nurse's station with Lathrop and Rollins.

ROLLINS
We've got to institutionalize her.
There's no other option.

MARCUS
Look, I've told you. She wasn't
trying to kill herself. It was an
accident. I was there. I saw what
happened...It was an accident.

LATHROP
You're taking an awful chance with
her life. Do you realize that?
MARCUS

I know that...You've talked to her.
Does she seem suicidal to you?...

It was a freak accident. That's all
it was.

INT. CARLA'S HOSPITAL ROOM -- MORNING

Marcus enters Carla's room. He stands at the door and looks
at her. She is watching a cartoon on television. She smiles
and laughs with childlike delight. She gently bites her
lower lip. She looks at Marcus. He smiles at her.

CARLA
Is everything alright?

MARCUS
Everything's good.

He goes to the bed.

CARLA
Are they going to let me go home?
70.
MARCUS
In just a few days. They want you
to rest and heal a little bit.
CARLA
I'm going home with you. I'm your
wife. That's so strange.
INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY -- DAY

Marcus walks Carla down the hall. She wears her gown, and
slippers. She rests her head against his shoulder.

They pass the chapel.

CARLA
Oh! Marcus.

MARCUS
What?

CARLA

It's a little chapel.
He stops and looks at her.

CARLA (CONT'D)
I want you to do something for me.

INT. HOSPITAL GIFT SHOP -- DAY
Marcus looks at a display of children's rings.
INT. HOSPITAL CHAPEL -- DAY

Marcus and Carla are kneeling at the little altar at the
front of the chapel. He slips a ring onto her finger. It
is a three-dollar plastic ring.

MARCUS
With this ring I thee wed.

Carla is delighted. She takes another other ring, which is
slightly less feminine, and puts it on his finger.

CARLA
And I promise to love you, cherish
you...what else?

MARCUS
In sickness and in health.

CARLA
Right. As long as we both shall
live.
71.

MARCUS
I now pronounce us man and wife.

CARLA
You may kiss the bride.

He leans forward. They kiss.
INT. LIBRARY -- DAY

Carruthers searches for a book. From the titles on the spines
it clear that he is in the "Occult" section.

Later, he is at a long table with several books spread out
and opened. He turns a page and studies a medieval drawing
of an evil female winged demon as she attacks an infant in
its mother's arms.

One of the other books is open to an illustration of a
pentagram. Carruthers leans back, sighs, rubs his face.

EXT. MARCUS'S HOUSE -- DAY

Marcus opens the car door. He leads Carla to the house.
She carries some flowers and a balloon from the hospital.

CARLA
This is our house?

MARCUS
I know. It's not much.

CARLA
No. It's nice.

He unlocks the front door. She starts to go in.

MARCUS
Wait.

He picks her up, and carries her across the threshold. She
is delighted.

INT. MARCUS'S BEDROOM -- DAY

Marcus lays Carla down on the bed. He kisses her. They
start to make love.

INT. LIBRARY -- DAY

Carruthers looks up from his books. He notices a man at the
far end of the table. The man is bearded, with small round
eye glasses and rumpled clothes. It is the man we saw earlier
walking his dogs in Lindsay's neighborhood. It is Martineau.

Martineau works with stacks of books open around him. He
looks over at Carruthers. Carruthers gives him a small smile.
72.
Martineau, expressionless, goes back to his books.
Carruthers turns the page in his book. He sees another
drawing, similar to the first. This time, the demon is eating
a man's intestines. The man is still alive and screaming.

INT. MARCUS'S BEDROOM -- DAY

Marcus is very gently, very slowly, almost making love to
Carla. She touches his face.

CARLA
Marcus...

He looks at her.
CARLA (CONT'D)

It's my soul that's a virgin. Not

my body. You don't have to be so

gentle.
He resumes his task, less cautiously.
INT. MARCUS'S BATHROOM -- NIGHT
Carla stands at the mirror, in her robe. She looks at her
face in the mirror. She studies it. She looks at her teeth,
she touches a small scar on her chin.
INT. MARCUS'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT
Marcus lies on the bed, asleep.
INT. MARCUS'S BATHROOM -- NIGHT
Carla steps back from the mirror. She removes the robe.
She looks at her naked body in the mirror. Her expression
says: "Not bad at all."
INT. POLICE OBSERVATION ROOM -- DAY
Carruthers enters a police observation room. Frank, cup of
coffee in hand, stands near the window. Josie is on the

other side of the glass.

CARRUTHERS
Thanks for letting me in.

FRANK
Toxicology came back. She must be
the only hooker in the city who isn't
on something.

CARRUTHERS
You mind if I talk to her?
73.
INT. POLICE INTERROGATION ROOM -- DAY
Carruthers sits across the table from Josie.

JOSIE
I thought you said you wasn't a cop.

CARRUTHERS
I'm not. Used to be.

JOSIE
They don't believe me. They think
I'm crazy.

CARRUTHERS
I believe every word you said.

JOSIE
You do?

INT. MARCUS'S CAR -- DAY

Marcus drives through a residential neighborhood. Carla is
in the passenger seat. She is wearing a colorful scarf as a
blindfold.

CARLA
Where are you taking me?

MARCUS
You'll see.

CARLA
So mysterious...

INT. POLICE INTERROGATION ROOM -- DAY

JOSIE
She was sick, you know. She got the
H.I.V.

Carruthers nods.

JOSIE (CONT'D)
Me and the other girls, we always
make the men wear condoms. Always.
Not Lizzie. And if her men tried to
put one on, she'd get 'em excited,
then she'd take it off. She wanted
to make 'em sick. She didn't just
want their money...She wanted to
destroy them.

EXT. EMMA'S HOUSE -- DAY

Marcus stops the car outside Emma's house. Emma's mother,
Charlotte, is weeding the flower garden at the front steps.
74.

CARLA
Are we here?

MARCUS
We're here.

He reaches over and helps her take off the blindfold. She
looks around. Her smile slowly fades.

MARCUS (CONT'D)
Your mom's working on the flowers.

Carla looks at the woman. Her expression is not soft. Marcus
opens his door.

CARLA
Marcus--

MARCUS
Come on. Let's go see her.

She grabs his arm.

MARCUS (CONT'D)
It's alright. I can introduce you as
my wife. We can be friends with
her. You can still know her.

CARLA
This is so sweet. I know what you're
trying to do. But...this is my old
life. I have to be somebody else
now. I don't want to think about
the past. I want everything to be
new for us. I want to celebrate.
Our future.

Marcus looks out at Camille. He thinks it over.

MARCUS
You want to celebrate?

INT. FOUR STAR RESTAURANT -- NIGHT
Marcus and Carla eat at a very fancy restaurant. They're
eating steaks and drinking red wine. Marcus hands her a

nicely wrapped gift.

CARLA
What's this?

MARCUS
Open it.

She does. It is a leather-bound blank diary.
75.
MARCUS (CONT'D)
A new book for a new start. I know
how much you like to write.

She closes it.

MARCUS (CONT'D)
Do you like it?

CARLA

I'm not going to tell you.
MARCUS

You're not.
CARLA

I'm going to show you.
INT. MARCUS'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

Carla throws Marcus down on the bed. She climbs on top of
him. He rolls her over and kisses her. She rolls him onto
his back.

CARLA
I like it better this way.

She rips his shirt open. He likes it. She kisses his chest.
She licks his nipple, then playfully bites it.

MARCUS
Ow.

She laughs. She kisses his belly and unbuckles his pants.
She gently bites her lower lip. She takes the skin above
his belly button into her mouth. He's in heaven. Then she
bites him.

MARCUS (CONT'D)
Ouch. That hurt.

CARLA
Sorry.

She pulls his pants down. He's a little worried now, but he
lets her do her thing. And then she bites him again.

MARCUS
Ow! Dammit! That hurts.

He pulls back to the head of the bed. She stays where she
is, on all fours. He looks down at his stomach. She's drawn
blood. She looks up at him, a wicked smile on her face, an
animal look in her eyes.
76.

CARLA
(in a deep, guttaral,
dual voice)
Sucram em cuph.

It's as if she slapped him in the face. She crawls to him,
kisses him. He doesn't kiss back. She looks down at his
lap.

CARLA (CONT'D)
What happened? You don't like me?

She starts to go down again. He slides out of the bed. He
buckles his pants.

CARLA (CONT'D)
You gonna make me finish on my own?

He looks at her, takes his shirt, leaves the room.

INT. MARCUS'S KITCHEN -- NIGHT

Marcus sits at the kitchen table. He drinks a cup of coffee.
Carla enters. She stands in the doorway. She leans against

the wall and watches him.

CARLA
I'm sorry.

He doesn't answer.
CARLA (CONT'D)
I just...I thought...that's what
you'd want me to do.

MARCUS
What was that? What you said.

CARLA
I don't know.

She goes to him, puts her arms around him. He tenses.
CARLA (CONT'D)
Let's start over. I'll be me this
time.
She kisses him. Slowly, reluctantly, he starts to respond.
INT. BAR -- NIGHT
Carruthers and Frank sit at the bar, both nursing a Guinness.
FRANK
I'm not gonna investigate this, you

know that. As far as the department
is concerned, this case is closed.
77.

CARRUTHERS
I know.
FRANK
You're gonna keep going, aren't you?
CARRUTHERS
Yep.
FRANK

(sighs, puts his money
on the counter)
Just...I don't know. Be careful.

CARRUTHERS
Yes, dear.

Frank goes. Carruthers takes another drink.
INT. MARCUS'S BEDROOM -- MORNING

Marcus is asleep. Carla brings him breakfast in bed. She
wakes him.

CARLA
Wake up, sleepy head. I didn't wear
you out last night, did I?

MARCUS
What time is it?

CARLA
You have to be to work in 45 minutes.
So eat your eggs and toast.

MARCUS
What are you going to do today?

CARLA
Don't know. Shopping, probably.

As she leaves the room, she flips up the back of her robe
and flashes her ass at him. He smiles.

CARLA (CONT'D)
I'll start the shower.
(stops in doorway)
I'll be waiting for you.
She goes. He looks down at the food, but doesn't eat.
EXT. MARCUS'S HOUSE -- DAY

Carla exits the house. She locks the front door. She walks
to her car, gets in, starts the car, and drives away.
78.

Marcus watches her from his car, which he has parked on the
side of the street a half a block away. He follows her.

EXT. HOMELESS SHELTER -- DAY

Carla's car passes the homeless shelter without even slowing
down. Marcus follows, several cars behind her.

EXT. CRACKHOUSE -- DAY

Marcus pulls his car to the curb near the crackhouse. He
watches as Carla walks up the front steps and enters. He's
very confused.

EXT. MARCUS'S HOUSE -- DAY

Carruthers knocks on Marcus's door. There is no answer. He
peeks in the window. No one's home.

EXT. CRACKHOUSE -- DAY

Marcus watches from his car as Carla exits the crackhouse.
At the sidewalk she stops to talk to a TATTOOED MAN.

The man clearly doesn't know her. He is reluctant at first,
but she shows him some money, and he instantly warms to her.
He looks around, as if expecting to see someone watching
him, then leads Carla into the building. Marcus watches.

INT. AMBULANCE STATION RECEPTION DESK -- DAY

Carruthers goes to the front desk of the ambulance station.
A RECEPTIONIST hangs up the telephone and looks up at him.

CARRUTHERS
I'm looking for Marcus Galan.

RECEPTIONIST
I'm sorry. He's not in today.

CARRUTHERS
Do you have his cell phone number?

RECEPTIONIST
I can't give that out. I'm sorry.

CARRUTHERS
Let me give you my card. Have him
call me the minute he gets in.

EXT. CRACKHOUSE -- DAY
Marcus is still waiting outside the crackhouse. Finally,

Carla emerges from the building. She carries an envelope,
which she folds and puts into her bag.
79.

She goes to her car, and starts away. Marcus pulls out to
follow and collides into a passing car.

MARCUS
Dammit!

His fender is smashed. The other DRIVER gets out. Marcus
watches Carla's car disappear around the corner.

EXT. DOWNTOWN STREETS -- EVENING

Carruthers cruises the downtown streets, looking for Josie.
He sees her. She walks the street, cautiously looking for

business. Carruthers pulls his car to the curb.
CARRUTHERS
Hey, sister.
JOSIE
I don't want to talk about that
anymore.
CARRUTHERS

This isn't about that.

JOSIE
What's it about?

CARRUTHERS
How much do I get for fifty dollars?

JOSIE
Everybody gets relief, baby.

CARRUTHERS
How much do I get for five hundred?

JOSIE
Five hundred...

He nods. He shows her the cash. She moves to the car.
JOSIE (CONT'D)
Alright, old man. For five hundred
dollars I'm gonna give you the party
mix, baby.

We watch, from someone's p.o.v., as Josie gets in the car.
Carruthers drives away.

INT. MARCUS'S HOUSE -- EVENING
Marcus enters.

MARCUS
Emma?
80.
She's not there.
INT. MARCUS'S KITCHEN -- NIGHT
Marcus eats dinner alone at the table.
EXT. NIGHT CLUB -- NIGHT
Carla approaches the DOORMAN at a busy night club. She gives
him the envelope. He opens it, gives it back, and lets her
in. The others, who are still waiting in line, watch her
enviously as she enters.
INT. NIGHT CLUB -- NIGHT
Carla enters the night club. A goth band is screaming and
rocking on the stage. Hundreds of PARTIERS are banging their

heads and bodies to the music.

A young ROCKER, beer in hand, pushes his GIRLFRIEND against
the wall.

ROCKER

You spilled my fucking beer!
GIRLFRIEND

You were falling down. I was just--

He slaps her. Carla passes by. She doesn't give the Rocker
and the girl a second glance. After she passes, the Rocker
once again pushes the girl against the wall.

Carla approaches a table where a MAN WITH A GOATEE entertains
his friends. She gives the Goatee the letter. He reads it.
He stands and leads Carla into a corridor.

The goth band continues to play. The Goatee emerges from an
office. Carla gives him a wad of money. The Goatee gives
her a small paper bag. She smiles and starts away.

On her way to the door, Carla sees the Rocker sitting at a
table, surrounded by FRIENDS. His beer is full again, and
he looks like he's had one too many.

Carla stops at his table. The Rocker looks at her. So do
his friends. She unbuttons the top button of her blouse and
playfully bites her lower lip.

INT. NIGHT CLUB BATHROOM -- NIGHT

Carla enters the men's bathroom with the Rocker and three of
his friends. A MAN leaves as they enter. One of the Rocker's
friends, we'll just call him #2, puts his back against the
door. #3 has a video camera to record the beautiful moment.
81.

ROCKER
Alright. Let's see what you're
advertising.

He pushes Carla against the sink, bends her over, lifts her
skirt.

CARLA
You like that?

ROCKER
That's...that's alright.

The Rocker laughs. He and his friends look like kids in a
candy store. The Rocker starts to unbuckle his belt. #3
lifts the video camera and starts to record. He starts at
Carla's waist and then moves to her face. She turns to him
and looks into the camera. Her smile becomes a snarl. She
turns into the demon.

#3 drops the camera. Carla pulls a knife from her belt. We
recognize it as the silver-handled ceremonial knife with the
serpentine blade. She puts the knife to use.

INT. NIGHT CLUB -- NIGHT

A YOUNG CLUBBER approaches the men's room. When he gets to
the door, Carla exits. She smiles at him as she walks past.
Confused, he double-checks the sign on the door, then enters.
INT. NIGHT CLUB BATHROOM -- NIGHT

The Young Clubber stops, shocked, when he sees the carnage.
She's killed all four of them. Blood is everywhere.

Behind the Clubber is a sign: "If This Restroom Needs
Attention, Please Contact a Club Employee."

INT. NIGHT CLUB -- NIGHT
Carla walks through the crowd, and out the front door.
INT. MOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT

Carruthers locks the motel room door and closes the drapes.
Josie sits on the bed. She starts to take off her blouse.

CARRUTHERS
That's all right, honey. Not tonight.

JOSIE
What are you talkin' about?

CARRUTHERS
I want you to curl up in that bed.
Watch t.v. Go to sleep.
82.

JOSIE
And what are you gonna do?

CARRUTHERS
I'm gonna sit in this chair. And
I'm gonna watch over you.

He pulls out his gun, a .357 magnum, and sets it on the table.

CARRUTHERS (CONT'D)
And if anybody comes after you, if
anybody tries to hurt you, I'm gonna
kill ‘em.

JOSIE
What about the money?

CARRUTHERS
I'll give you the money. When it's
all over. We'll get you out of this
town.

Josie's emotions almost break free. She curls up under the
covers, she puts her head on the pillow. She looks at him.

JOSIE
You anybody's daddy?
CARRUTHERS
I was once.
INT. MARCUS'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

Carla enters. Marcus is sitting in a chair, under a lamp.

MARCUS

Where the hell have you been?
CARLA

Excuse me?
MARCUS

What do you have in your bag?

CARLA
It's a present. For you.

Marcus rises, quickly. He grabs her purse and finds the
small paper bag.

CARLA (CONT'D)
It's none of your business!

He snatches it away from her. She lets him open it: inside
is a small silver case with a syringe, several needles, two
small glass bottles.
83.

MARCUS
You go from feeding the homeless to
shooting heroin?

CARLA
It's not heroin.

MARCUS
Let me see your arms.

CARLA
Don't touch me.

MARCUS
Let me see your arms!

He wrestles her. She fights. He pulls her to the ground.
He pulls up her sleeves. She doesn't have track marks.

CARLA
Satisfied?

MARCUS
I want Emma back.

CARLA
I'm not going to live my life as a
saint. Not again. I tried that.
It wasn't a happy ending.

Marcus rises.
CARLA (CONT'D)
Whatever's out there, I'm gonna try
it. Everything. I'm gonna do it.
MARCUS
(goes to the door)
This is not what I wanted.

CARLA
Leave it.

He looks down at the silver case. He thinks it over, then
tosses it to her. She catches it. He goes.

INT. MARCUS'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

Carla sits on the edge of the bed. She holds the silver
case, but doesn't open it.

She sits, and thinks. She takes off her toy wedding ring,
and holds it in the palm of her hand.
84.
EXT. BRIDGE -- NIGHT
Marcus walks along a city bridge. He takes his ring off.
He throws it into the river. He stands, looking down at the
water. He sees someone on the banks, watching him. It looks
like Emma. It is Emma. He's certain of it.

He starts toward her.

MARCUS
Emma.

He gets to the bank, but she's gone. He looks around. She
has vanished.

INT. MARCUS'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

Carla drops the toy ring into the trash. She rises and gets
her coat.

INT. JENNY'S APARTMENT BLDG. HALLWAY -- NIGHT
Marcus waits at an apartment doorway.

JENNY (V.O.)
Who is it?

MARCUS
Open up.

The door opens. Jenny, in her robe, looks out at him.

MARCUS (CONT'D)
You want to hear a crazy story?

JENNY
At two in the morning? You bet.

INT. JENNY'S KITCHEN -- NIGHT

Marcus sit at the dinner table. Jenny gets two beers from
the fridge.

MARCUS
You didn't see her, Jen. The look
in her eyes. It's not Carla in there.

JENNY
You think it's this dead girl. Emma.
That she's in Carla's body.

MARCUS
No. I mean, I did. But...it's not
Emma. I don't know who it is.

JENNY
I think you should get some help.
85.

MARCUS
Why did she go to that building? Of
all the crackhouses in this city,
why did she go to that one? And the
way she...It's like she knew the
place.

JENNY
Okay, this is getting too freaky.

MARCUS
I'm not crazy.

JENNY
I know you're not.

MARCUS
God, Jen. I don't know what to do.

JENNY
I think we should go see Martineau.

Marcus sighs.

JENNY (CONT'D)
Maybe he can help.

MARCUS
I'm not gonna see Martineau. Not
tonight.

She looks at him. There's something very maternal, very
tender in her expression.

MARCUS (CONT'D)
(he's so tired)
I don't want to go home, Jen.

JENNY
I don't want you to go home.

INT. JENNY'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

Jenny lies in bed. She looks through the doorway, into the
bathroom. Marcus washes his face. She watches him.

He finishes. He stops in her doorway.

MARCUS
Goodnight.

JENNY
G'night.

He smiles, and goes. She stares at the empty doorframe.
She sighs, softly. Then turns out the light.
86.
INT. JENNY'S BEDROOM -- MORNING

Jenny wakes. Marcus, of course, isn't in bed with her. She
gets up.

EXT. MARTINEAU'S HOUSE -- MORNING

Marcus knocks on the door of a small craftsman style home.

A dog starts to bark. Martineau, the bearded eccentric we
last saw in the library, opens the door cautiously. He wears
an unbuttoned sweater over a t-shirt.

The dog, a Rottweiler, tries to get out.

MARTINEAU
Get back! Klaus! Back! Sit!

The dog obeys. Martineau turns his attention back to Marcus.

MARCUS
Martineau. Hey.

MARTINEAU
Haven't seen you in a while.

MARCUS
This is going to sound kind of weird,
but...I'm having what I think is a
supernatural experience.

MARTINEAU
Go talk to your priest.

MARCUS
I don't have a priest. Look, I could
really use your help.

MARTINEAU
Are you wired?

MARCUS
What? No.

MARTINEAU

(opens door)
Alright. Come in.

INT. MARTINEAU'S HOUSE -- MORNING

Martineau closes the door after Marcus enters. The house is
a warm cave full of books and newspapers.

MARTINEAU
Turn around. Hands on the wall.

MARCUS
Give me a break.
87.

MARTINEAU
Do it, goddammit.

Marcus complies. Martineau frisks him. The Rottweiler
growls. Two more dogs, equally unfriendly, enter.

MARTINEAU (CONT'D)
Is this some joke? Some prank? You
looking for a good laugh at my
expense?

MARCUS
No. I promise

MARTINEAU
You're clean.

MARCUS
You've got lots of dogs.

MARTINEAU
Seven of 'em. An important number,
metaphysically speaking. The
Egyptians believed that dogs have an
instinctive god-like goodness.

The doberman sniffs Marcus's balls.

MARTINEAU (CONT'D)
In fact, of all creatures, they're
the most immune to any sort of
domination or possession by demonic
spirits.

MARCUS
No shit?

MARTINEAU
Not one speck of it. So...at the
station. They all still think I'm

nuts?

MARCUS
Yeah.

MARTINEAU
Wonder why.

Martineau laughs. Marcus nods and smiles.
INT. JENNY'S APARTMENT -- MORNING
Jenny is dressed in her uniform. She takes a last swig of

coffee, grabs her keys from a hook on the wall and starts
for the door.
88.

When she opens the door, Carla is standing in the hall,
staring straight at her. Jenny gasps and steps back.

CARLA
You spent the night with my husband.

JENNY
Carla, listen--

CARLA
You slept with my husband. I think
I at least deserve a cup of coffee.

INT. JENNY'S KITCHEN -- MORNING

Carla waits at the kitchen table. Jenny puts a cup of coffee
in front of Carla, then sits at the table. The telephone is
attached to the wall behind her. Carla tries the coffee.

CARLA
If you fuck as bad as you make coffee,
I don't have anything to worry about.

JENNY
I didn't have sex with your husband.
Nothing happened. He wanted to talk.

Carla is unconvinced.

JENNY (CONT'D)
You want to come to the bedroom and
smell the sheets?

CARLA
(a moment, then...)
Do you mind if I use your telephone?

JENNY
Go for it.

Carla gets up and takes the phone from the hook. She gives
Jenny a "give me some privacy" look.

Jen looks down at her coffee and is lifting the cup when
Carla wraps the phone's cord around Jenny's neck. She pulls
it tight. Jenny drops the coffee cup. It smashes.

Jenny struggles to get free. Carla pulls the cord tighter.
Jenny's face begins to turn blue.

INT. MOTEL ROOM -- MORNING

Carruthers awakes in the chair. He immediately looks at the
bed. Josie isn't in it. He stands.

CARRUTHERS
Josie?
89.

He looks in the bathroom. She isn't there. He checks his

wallet. The money is gone.

CARRUTHERS (CONT'D)
No.

And he's out the door.

INT. MARTINEAU'S KITCHEN -- MORNING

Marcus is seated at a small kitchen table. There are books
and dirty dishes everywhere. Martineau drops a manuscript

on the table in front of Marcus.

MARTINEAU

You should take this manuscript.
It's twenty-five bucks, but that
just covers the cost of the photo
copies. I want to get it published,
but the only outfit that'll take it
only publishes stuff about UFOs and
Bigfoot and crazy shit like that.

Marcus looks down at the coffee-stained manuscript:
of the Afterlife" by Jacob Martineau.

MARCUS

So, the um...the afterlife--
MARTINEAU

Uh huh.
MARCUS

Is it, you know, scary?

MARTINEAU
Well, that depends. Generally
speaking, if you're not a bad person
then your afterlife will probably be
like a really nice weekend in Santa
Barbara.

MARCUS
Okay.

MARTINEAU
But if you're an asshole, well, it'll
probably be like your average Thursday
in New Jersey.

MARCUS
And do you have to go? I mean, let's
Say you were a bad person, a really
bad person, and you knew what was
waiting. Could you, I don't know--

"Secrets
90.

MARTINEAU
Stay here? Sure. Some do. Like
poltergeists. Spend the rest of
eternity moving furniture around,
shit like that.

MARCUS
What about coming back, but...in
another person's body?

MARTINEAU
Permanent possession.

MARCUS
Right.

MARTINEAU
(rising)
Let's go talk someplace else.

MARCUS
Why?

MARTINEAU
Because this place is BUGGED!

Martineau slaps the table and laughs. He starts out. Marcus
follows, with the manuscript.

EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET -- MORNING

Josie walks along the early morning street. There is very
little traffic, very few pedestrians.

She sees the Greyhound Bus station across the street, at the
next corner.

EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET -- MORNING

Carruthers drives. He's looking for Josie. He doesn't see
her.

EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET -- MORNING
Josie starts across the street, toward the bus station. We
watch her from inside a parked car. The car starts to move

forward.

She walks. The car approaches and picks up speed. It is
Carla's car. Carruthers sees Josie.

The approaching car immediately picks up speed. Carruthers
sees the car. Josie doesn't.

CARRUTHERS
Josie! No!
gl.

Josie sees the car, but it is too late. She freezes in the
center of the road and stares at the demonic face of the
driver. The car slams into her.

Josie's body smashes into the car's windshield. The force
of the hit sends her up and over the car, spinning through
the air, directly at an oncoming van.

Josie's body crashes through the van's windshield. The
PASSENGERS recoil, in horror. The driver slams on the brakes.
A sign on the side of the van reads: MT. OLIVE BAPTIST YOUTH
CAMP.

The car speeds past Carruthers. He looks at the driver, but
sees only the demon. As she passes, the demon locks eyes
with him.

Inside the van, a YOUNG WOMAN looks down. A hand is on her
breast. CAMERA PULLS BACK to show that it is Josie's severed
arm. A YOUNG MAN looks down at his lap. Josie's severed
head is face-down in his lap. He turns it over and looks
into her bloody face. Everyone in the van screams.

Carruthers watches as the killer's car turns the corner and
races away.

EXT. PARK -- DAY

Marcus and Martineau walk in a beautiful park. 100 year old
oak trees line the path on both sides.

MARTINEAU
Possession is most often accomplished
by very ancient spirits, spirits who
have never been worthy of receiving
a human birth of their own.

MARCUS
Could someone who isn't one of these
ancient spirits, someone who was
alive, recently, return in someone
else's body?

MARTINEAU
Not likely. The possessing spirit
wouldn't have the skill or the
strength to overcome the host. Not
for more than a few seconds.

MARCUS
But what if the host dies, then the
host spirit leaves the body.

MARTINEAU
Right.
92.

MARCUS
And then somebody, like an EMT, brings
the body back...

MARTINEAU
Okay.

MARCUS
..-But then another spirit, a
different spirit--

MARTINEAU
--Enters the vacated body.

Martineau stops walking. Marcus stops, also.

MARCUS
Right. Could that happen?
MARTINEAU
It's possible, but...to have that
kind of skill, we're talkin'...this

would have to be one extremely
talented and very ancient spirit.

MARCUS
But if it did happen, a good spirit
wouldn't do this. She'd just...stay
in Santa Barbara.

MARTINEAU
Right.

MARCUS
So if it did happen, and this other
spirit did come back...

MARTINEAU
Then you've probably got one very
strong, very evil bitch on your hands.

EXT. MARCUS'S HOUSE -- DAY

Carla gets out of her car. The front grill is broken, and
the windshield is smashed. She opens the trunk.

Jenny, bound and gagged, looks up at her. Jen is terrified.
Carla smiles.

INT. AMBULANCE STATION RECEPTION DESK -- DAY

Carruthers enters the ambulance station. He goes immediately
to the front desk.

CARRUTHERS
I need to speak with Marcus Galan.
Right now.
93.

RECEPTIONIST
I told you, sir--

Carruthers reaches across the desk and picks up her phone.
He pushes it into her face.

CARRUTHERS
Call him. Now.

INT. COFFEE SHOP -- DAY

Marcus and Martineau sit near the front window of a coffee
shop. They both have coffee.

MARCUS
So how do I get rid of her?

MARTINEAU
Figure out why she's here. Maybe if
you help her do whatever it is she
came back to do, she'll move on.

Marcus's cell phone rings. He turns it off.

MARCUS
What if she didn't come back to do
something? What if she just doesn't
want to move on?

MARTINEAU
She's stronger than you. You're
gonna have to make her want to leave.

MARCUS
How?

MARTINEAU
She's evil. So be really really
good.

MARCUS

What, should I start going to Sunday
School or something?

MARTINEAU
Wouldn't hurt.

MARCUS
Should I wear a crucifix?

MARTINEAU
She's not a vampire, man.

MARCUS
Well, I don't know this stuff.
94.
INT. AMBULANCE STATION -- DAY
There is no answer on the telephone.

RECEPTIONIST
I'm sorry, Mr. Carruthers.

He slams the phone down, and starts out.

CARRUTHERS
(shouting back at her)
Keep trying him!

INT. MARTINEAU'S WORKSHOP -- EVENING

Marcus sits at a tall table in Martineau's basement workshop.
The place is an eclectic mix of religious iconography. We
see books, diagrams, and paraphernalia from Kabbala, early
Cristianity, etc.

Martineau approaches. He holds a nickel-plated .38 revolver.
He is loading it with bullets.

MARTINEAU
Alright. We've got silver bullets.
I soaked them, for 30 seconds, in
holy water. Try one bullet to the
heart. Another to the brain.

He gives the gun to Marcus.

MARCUS
You're out of your mind.

MARTINEAU
We're not talking about murder here.
The girl whose body it is--

MARCUS
My wife.

MARTINEAU
She's long gone. I'm sorry.

MARCUS
You think this will...finish it?

MARTINEAU

I have absolutely no idea. We're
venturing into new territory here.
But, if I were you, I'd shoot her,
put a stake through her heart, cut
her head off, stuff her mouth with
garlic and bury her a hundred feet
deep. Might as well cover all the
bases.
95.
Marcus looks at the gun.
MARTINEAU (CONT'D)
In the probable words of George
Armstrong Custer: "If you're gonna
go down, go down fighting."
EXT. MARCUS'S HOUSE -- EVENING

Carruthers knocks on Marcus's door. He waits. Carla opens.
She is wearing simple clothes and an apron.

CARLA

Yes?
CARRUTHERS

I'm John Carruthers. Is Marcus in?
CARLA

I'm afraid not. I'm his wife.
CARRUTHERS

Good to meet you, ma'am.

CARLA
He should be home anytime. You're
welcome to wait inside, if you'd
like.

CARRUTHERS
Thank you.

INT. MARCUS'S KITCHEN -- EVENING

Carla tends to a large pot of soup on the stove. Carruthers
sits at the table.

A nice dinner is in the works. Wine, candles, flowers, you
name it. Two places have been set. A salad has been placed
at each setting.

CARLA
So you think this woman, this
prostitute, came back. Possessed
the other woman's body.

CARRUTHERS
It's more like she stole it. Like
the owner stepped away, but left the
keys in the car. She hopped in and
went on a little joyride.

CARLA
(tests the stew)
I'm trying something new. I can't
quite seem to get it right.
(MORE)
96.

CARLA (CONT'D)
(back to Carruthers)
And now the second woman's dead. So
she's in somebody else's body.

CARRUTHERS
I know it sounds insane. But, you
see...my grandparents. They practiced
the Old Time Religion, if you know
what I'm saying. I was around it a
lot as a kid. Scared the hell out
of me...But I remember my grandma
used to talk about these "hoppers."
That's what she called them. Spirits
that don't move on. As soon as one
body's used up, they jump into
another.

CARLA
So you think this prostitute was
a...a hopper?

CARRUTHERS
But it didn't start there. She and
this school teacher were just the
latest in what could be a thousand
different lives.

Carruthers pulls a photocopy of the medieval drawing from
his pocket. He unfolds it.

CARRUTHERS (CONT'D)
Have you ever heard of Lilith?

CARLA
Lilith who?

CARRUTHERS
It's an old legend. Adam's first
wife, before Eve. Things didn't
work out. Adam rejected her. So
then God made Eve, and Eve became
the mother of all living. But Lilith
was angry.

CARLA
Well, that's understandable.

CARRUTHERS
And at death she refused to leave.
She swore she'd get revenge on Adam
and Eve and all their children.
They say she's responsible for
stillborn births, and the death of
infants. And that she's the queen
of these...
97.

CARLA
Hoppers.

CARRUTHERS
Right. Here's a picture.

Carla looks over his shoulder at the winged female demon
attacking the mother and baby.

CARLA
It's not a very flattering picture.

CARRUTHERS
No.

She holds the spoon out to him.

CARLA
Here. You taste it.

He tries it.

CARRUTHERS
It's...it's good.

CARLA
There's something missing.

She looks at his face, as if the answer is somewhere in his
expression. She gently bites her lower lip.

CARRUTHERS
I'm sorry, ma'am. I don't have much
of a head for cooking.

CARLA
Hmmmm.

She looks down at the picture of Lilith again.

CARLA (CONT'D)
Oh. I must look a mess.

CARRUTHERS
Not at all.
CARLA
You're just being sweet. I'm going

to go freshen up a bit. I want to
talk to you more about this theory
of yours. Don't go anywhere.

She goes. Carruthers looks at the picture, then folds it
and puts it back in his pocket.
98.
EXT. CEMETERY -- EVENING

Marcus walks through the cemetery. A truck stops near him.

CARETAKER
We lock the gate at dark.
MARCUS
Thanks.
Marcus approaches Emma's grave. As he gets closer he sees
someone at the grave. It is a woman. She wears a white
coat. As Marcus gets closer, she turns. It is Emma.

She smiles at him. He stops, several feet away.

EMMA
Thank you, for being kind to my
mother.

He doesn't know what to say.

EMMA (CONT'D)
I can't stay long. I was sent to
tell you one thing. One thing only.

MARCUS
You didn't come back to me.

She smiles sadly, tenderly. She shakes her head.

EMMA
The good souls, Marcus...they don't
come back. Where I am now, it's so
beautiful.

Marcus steps toward her.

MARCUS
Please...What do I...How--?

EMMA
You're a savior, Marcus. A healer.
We're alike in that way. We recognize
that in one another.

He takes another step toward her.

EMMA (CONT'D)
You can't beat her. You can't hide
from her. She's too powerful...Show
her the strength of your goodness.
The only thing she respects is
strength. You must gain her respect.

Marcus takes another step.
99.
EMMA (CONT'D)
Be true to yourself, Marcus, and
death will be your victory. If you
come where I am...she can't follow
you there.
He is almost close enough to touch her. She turns to go.

MARCUS
Emma. No, don't.

She looks back. There is an odd expression on her face, as
if someone is telling her something. Something alarming.

EMMA
You have to go home. Now. Go!

INT. MARCUS'S KITCHEN -- NIGHT

Carruthers stands. He looks up at the kitchen clock. He
sighs. He peeks out into the living room. He exits.

INT. MARCUS'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

Carruthers stands at the picture window. He looks at the
sky.

CARRUTHERS
No moon.

He goes to the hallway.

CARRUTHERS (CONT'D)
Carla? Ma'am?

He starts down the hall. He looks in the hallway bathroom.
She's not there.

He looks into a small storage room. She's not there. He
gets to the bedroom door. It is open a few inches.

CARRUTHERS (CONT'D)

Ma'am? Excuse me. The things I
said...You must think I'm absolutely
insane.

There is no answer. He pushes the door open. She isn't
there. The bathroom door is open. A light is on in the
bathroom. He goes to the bathroom door. He looks in.

CARRUTHERS (CONT'D)
Ma'am, I'm sorry. I really need to
speak with your--

She isn't there. He stands in the doorway, confused. He
turns to go. She is not lurking behind him, as we expect.
100.
INT. MARCUS'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

Carruthers enters the living room. He stands near the kitchen
door. He hears a car approach outside. He crosses to the
window. As he moves we see, in the background and slightly
out of focus, that one of the World War I swords is missing.
He looks out the window. Marcus's car pulls into the
driveway.

CARRUTHERS
Thank God.

As he turns, we see Carla behind him. She screams and runs
at him. Startled, he freezes for a split second, just long
enough for Carla to bury the sword, to the hilt, in his belly.
She steps back, leaving the sword in his body.

He falls to his knees. She goes to the wall and removes the
other sword. He slowly, painfully, pulls out his gun. Carla
stops in front of him. As he raises his gun, she swings the
second sword. In one smooth motion, she removes his head.

His gun drops to the floor.
EXT. MARCUS'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

Marcus sits in his car. He looks down at Martineau's gun.
He looks at the house. He sighs, gets out of the car, and
tucks the gun into the back of his pants. He walks, slowly,
to the front door and turns the knob. It's locked.

He takes out his keys and unlocks the door. When he finally
gets the door open, Carla is standing right there. Her
expression turns immediately friendly.

CARLA
You're home.

MARCUS
Why was the door locked?

CARLA
Just...feeling a little vulnerable,
I guess.

Marcus doesn't enter.

CARLA (CONT'D)
I have a surprise for you.

INT. MARCUS'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
Marcus follows Carla into the house. Carruthers' body is

gone. The swords are back on the wall. Carla closes and
locks the front door.
101.

MARCUS
Whose car is out there?

She shrugs. He doesn't believe her.

CARLA
You look at me and you still see
Carla. Baby, you don't have to worry
about that stuff with me...I've made
you dinner. Come on.

She goes into the kitchen. He follows. As he exits we linger
on the swords. Blood drips from the blade.

INT. MARCUS'S KITCHEN -- NIGHT

Marcus enters the kitchen and sees the spread on the table.
The main course is still cooking in a big pot on the stove.

CARLA
What do you think?

Marcus doesn't answer.

CARLA (CONT'D)
It's my way of saying "I'm sorry."
I've been acting kinda strange, I
know. But some pretty weird things
have happened to me. Everything's
going to be alright. Sit down. I've
got something for you.

And she exits. But he doesn't sit. He wanders to the stove.
Some of the cooking dishes are half-covered with water in
the sink. Some knives are on the counter. The big pot is
covered, and still cooking. Some of the broth has boiled
over the side of the pot.

Marcus opens his cell phone and hits a speed dial. A recorded
message immediately answers:

SHAWN (V.O.)
This is Shawn. I'm ignoring you.
Leave a message.

Marcus lifts the lid on the soup. The big pot is almost
full. It looks like stew. He sniffs it. Something's a little
off.

MARCUS
(into phone)
Hey, it's Marcus. Where are you?

He grabs the ladle and sticks it into the soup. It hits
something. He pushes the ladle down deep and then pulls it
up.
102.

MARCUS (CONT'D)
(into phone)
I could use you here at the house,
man. I need somebody to talk to. I
think I'm losing my--

Carruther's head emerges from the soup.

MARCUS (CONT'D)
SHIT! FUCK!

Marcus drops the ladle and the phone. He staggers back.
Something catches his eye in the kitchen window: outside,
Jenny is gagged and tied to a chair beside the pool.

Marcus hears something behind him. WE RACK FOCUS from Jenny
to the reflection in the window: Carla is running toward
him, the syringe held over her head. She brings it down.

He spins. He grabs her arm, but the force of her swing almost
puts the needle into his chest. He twists her wrist. She
drops the syringe, then immediately smashes her forehead

into his face.

He staggers back toward the sink. She grabs him by the
throat.

CARLA
You can't beat me. Don't even try.

He goes for the gun in his belt. As he's raising it, she
knocks it from his hand. It flies across the room, over the
dinner table.

She goes for her knife. He knocks it to the other side of
the room. He then knees her, hard, in the gut. She weakens,
but she doesn't let go. He spins her around and pins her
against the sink.

He forces her face into the dishwater. He holds her head
under water. She fights. Her arms search for some weapon.
She almost gets a knife. Her right arm knocks the pot from
the stove. The stew spills on the floor and Carruthers’
head rolls to the corner of the room.

She slams her heel into Marcus's groin. He weakens for a
moment. She gets her face out of the water. She gasps. He
squeezes her throat as hard as he can. He lifts her feet
from the floor.

She snarls at him, but he doesn't let go. Instead he smashes
the back of her head into the kitchen window. The glass
shatters.

At the pool, Jenny struggles. She tries to scream, but she
has been very thoroughly gagged and tied.
103.

Marcus tries to push Carla's neck into the jagged glass.
She pushes him away. He slips on the floor and falls against
the wall.

CARLA (CONT'D)
I already had my throat cut once
this week. Let's not do that again.

She picks up a chopping knife from the counter.

CARLA (CONT'D)
Your turn.

She jumps on him. He manages to grasp her forearm, but she
thrashes wildly. It's like fighting a wild animal.

He finally gets her turned over. He puts his knees on her
arms. She struggles, but can't get free. She goes still
for a moment. He looks at her face.

MARCUS
What are you?

CARLA
Do you really want to know what I
am?

She reveals the face of the demon. Marcus jumps back. He
slips on the floor and tries to put as much distance between
him and her as he can.

She crouches, then rises, and slowly reveals herself. She's
100% demon. Her hands are claws. Her body has the color
and texture of someone who has been dead for several days.

Marcus looks for anything to fight with. He starts opening
drawers. He finds towels, spoons, measuring cups, nothing
that's going to help him.

CARLA (CONT'D)
I've lived more lives than you could

ever imagine. I've been everywhere
on this earth. I've done everything
there is to do. I've been men, women,

and children in every place and in
every time.

He sees the syringe. He grabs it.

CARLA (CONT'D)
There's nothing you can tell me.
There's nothing you can teach me.
There's nothing you can think that
would suprise me.

She lifts the knife and goes for him. He thrusts the syringe.
She shifts and misses the thrust. She laughs.
104.

She lifts his arm and, very smoothly, slices his pectoral
muscle at the armpit.

He screams. He drops the syringe. She straddles him. She
picks up the syringe.

CARLA (CONT'D)
You're no more than a bug to me.
You're a plaything. A toy.

She sinks the syringe into his side. He shouts. She injects
the fluid into him.

He struggles. She lets him wriggle away. He rises and backs
away. He stumbles into the dinner table. It all crashes to
the floor. Carla advances.

CARLA (CONT'D)

You can't run away from me. You
could die, and I'd follow you into
hell.

She kneels beside him. We see from his point of view. His
vision is beginning to blur. She straddles him again.

CARLA (CONT'D)
The human family. What a pathetic
failure. Billions and billions of
you, crawling across the planet,
consuming your Mother Earth. And
there's not one of you that wouldn't
sacrifice a brother or a sister to
save your own skin. Not even you,
Marcus. You've saved a lot of people.
But would you willingly give your
life to save another? I don't think
so.

Marcus gets his legs under her and he thrusts. She flies
back into the sliding plate-glass door. Her body crashes
through and falls in a heap on the patio.

Marcus rises on his elbows. She laughs. She stands and
brushes glass from her clothes.

CARLA (CONT'D)
You like to play games, don't you,
Marcus? Let's play...Justice. We
can both win. I get what I want.
And you get what you deserve.

She picks up a shard of glass. It has been broken into the
shape of a jagged edged knife. She starts toward Jenny.

Marcus tries to stand, but he loses his balance and he falls.
He looks around for something that can help him.
105.

He sees, in the corner, his nickel-plated gun. He crawls
for it. Carla approaches Jenny. Jenny is freaking out.

CARLA (CONT'D)
I'm going to give both of you exactly
what you've earned...Death. You
never deserved life in the first
place.

Marcus grabs the gun. He crawls back toward the sliding
glass door.

EXT. MARCUS'S BACK YARD -- NIGHT

Carla stands behind Jenny. She puts the jagged edge of the
glass to Jenny's throat. She looks back at the house. Marcus
is gone.

CARLA
Get back here and watch this, you
coward!

Marcus staggers into the doorway. He falls. He leans against
the jagged glass. He raises the gun. We see from his point
of view. Everything is so blurry. He tries to focus. He
tries to aim, but can't. Carla puts her head near Jenny's.

CARLA (CONT'D)
Be careful where you point that thing.

Marcus can't focus worth a damn.

CARLA (CONT'D)
I'll make it easy for you.

Carla puts a hand on Jenny's chest and pushes her, chair and
all, into the pool. Jenny immediately sinks.

MARCUS
No!

CARLA
There. Now it's just me.

Marcus pulls the trigger. He misses.

CARLA (CONT'D)
One down. Five to go.

Jenny struggles. She and the chair settle at the bottom of
the pool. Carla starts walking toward Marcus. He, too,
takes a step forward. He shoots.

CARLA (CONT'D)
Not even close.

She keeps walking. He fires again.
106.

CARLA (CONT'D)
God damn. You ever shot a gun before?

He walks toward her. He pulls the trigger.

CARLA (CONT'D)
Mis-fire. That sucks.

He shoots. The bullet tears a piece out of her shoulder.
Now she's pissed, and she's only a few yards away.

CARLA (CONT'D)
One. Last. Chance.

He fires. She stops. So does he. Did he get her?
Jenny thrashes at the bottom of the pool.

Carla stands her ground. Dizzy, Marcus drops to his knees
in the grass.

Carla unexpectedly drops to her knees, too. Marcus pops
open the cylinder of the gun. He empties the expended
cartridges onto the grass.

Carla tries to summon the demon, but she doesn't have the
energy. Her face almost gets there, then returns to normal.

Marcus picks up the mis-fired bullet from the grass. He
puts it back in the cylinder and clicks the cylinder back
into place. Carla looks down at her chest. She touches a
hole over her left breast.

CARLA (CONT'D)
Right...in the heart.

She's fading fast. Marcus raises the gun and levels it three
inches from her forehead.

CARLA (CONT'D)
Good...game.

And he pulls the trigger. This time the gun fires, and blows
Carla's brains out the back of her head. She drops.

Marcus immediately discards the gun and crawls to the pool.
We see from his point of view. Everything is blurred and
dizzy.

Underwater, Jenny weakens. Her body convulses. She is
breathing water now. Marcus crawls to the edge of the pool.

MARCUS
Jenny...

He half falls, half throws himself into the water. He sees
her at the bottom. He uses all his strength to swim to her.
107.
She is conscious, but her lungs are filling with water.

He tries to untie her. There's no way. He tries to lift
her. He can't. He struggles. He fights. He watches as
her eyes roll back.

He screams in the water. He refuses to give up. He gets
one of her arms free, then the other. He takes in water.
He continues to untie her. He's fading fast. He gets one
of her legs almost free when he loses consciousness. His
hands slowly float away from the knot. His body drifts up
toward the surface, his arms floating straight out at his
sides.

INT. MARCUS'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

Shawn kicks in the front door. Jackson is with him. Jackson
sees Carruthers' body and goes to it. Shawn runs to the
kitchen. Jackson sees that Carruthers' head is gone.

EXT. MARCUS'S BACK YARD -- NIGHT

Shawn steps into the back yard. He sees Carla's body, then
Marcus floating, face-down, in the pool, his arms straight
out at his sides. He drops his kit and runs. He dives into
the water. He pulls Marcus to the edge. Jackson is there.

SHAWN
Take him.

Jackson pulls Marcus to the concrete as Shawn goes back
underwater. Jackson rolls Marcus onto his back. He pulls
his arms over his head. Marcus immediately convulses and
begins to vomit water.

Shawn unties Jenny's leg. He takes her to the surface.
Jackson is waiting at the edge of the pool. They pull her
to the side and start working on her.

Marcus slowly regains consciousness. He coughs. He vomits.
He breathes. He rolls onto his side and watches as Shawn
and Jackson work on Jenny. Shawn is doing CPR. Jenny is
unresponsive.

SHAWN (CONT'D)
(to Jenny)
C'mon, girl. I'm not giving up.
You hear me. We'll be here all night.
I'm not giving up on you.

He pumps her chest. Jackson breathes.

JACKSON
There's nothing, man.

SHAWN
Come on.
108.

Marcus watches. His vision focuses enough to see what they're
doing. His hope turns to horror.

MARCUS
No...

Shawn and Jackson work.

JACKSON
She's gone, man.

SHAWN
Jenny, come on...come on, baby...

He pushes on her chest. Her body unexpectedly convulses.
She vomits water and coughs.

Marcus's vision blurs and fades. As Marcus loses
consciousness we....... FADE TO BLACK:

FADE IN:

INT. MARCUS'S HOSPITAL ROOM -- DAY

Marcus awakes in a hospital bed. He is alone. He looks

around. He sees some flowers and a couple of "Get Well"

cards on the window sill.

He looks out the door. Across the hall, in the opposite

room, he sees another patient. She's sitting up in bed,

eating a meal. It is Jenny.

She sees him. She smiles gently. A NURSE enters his room.
NURSE

Oh, look who's awake. You've got

some color back in your face.

The nurse pulls the curtain beside the bed, blocking Marcus's
view of Jenny.

NURSE (CONT'D)
Let's check your blood pressure.

EXT. HOSPITAL PARKING LOT -- DAY

Frank, the police detective, gets out of his car. He
approaches the hospital.

INT. MARCUS'S HOSPITAL ROOM -- DAY
Frank stands at Marcus's bedside.

FRANK
Nothing more to tell?
109.

MARCUS
It's just like you said. We were
having an affair. She found out.
She tried to kill us both.

FRANK
Hell hath no fury like a woman
scorned.

MARCUS

I guess that's true.
Frank puts a business card on the table.

FRANK
John was a good friend of mine.
It's hard to believe a hundred pound
woman could take him down.

MARCUS
She was no ordinary woman.

FRANK
You and I both know that a lot more
went down than what they're writing
in the case file...Once you're healed
up, you and I are going to have a
sit down. I'll buy you a beer, and
you're gonna elaborate on that story.

Frank starts out.

FRANK (CONT'D)
You want the door closed?

MARCUS
No. Leave it open.

Frank goes. Marcus looks into the room across the hall.
Jenny is gone. An ORDERLY is making the bed.

EXT. HOSPITAL -- MORNING

A nurse pushes Marcus's wheelchair beyond the front doors of
the hospital. He holds a plastic bag with his cards and
toiletries. He's dressed in his street clothes.

NURSE
There you go. You sure you don't
want me to call a taxi or somebody?

MARCUS
I'll be fine. Thanks.

She turns and goes. Marcus takes a deep breath. He puts
the plastic bag in a trash can. He looks around. A woman
waits for him.
110.

She stands several yards away and leans against a pillar.
It is Jenny. She wears a long dark coat and looks absolutely
ravishing. She approaches.

JENNY
You pulled through.

She smiles at him. He doesn't return the smile.

JENNY (CONT'D)
Shall we walk?

EXT. CITY CENTER -- MORNING

Marcus and Jenny walk down a busy street. They are surrounded
by people, cars, noise, confusion, organized chaos. They
don't talk. They stop at a busy corner. She turns to him.
She gently bites her lower lip.

JENNY
I guess this is where we say goodbye.
Thanks. It was fun.

Marcus looks at her. He doesn't speak.

JENNY (CONT'D)
You know, you can never kill me.
Not really.

MARCUS
You...took everything from me.

JENNY
Not everything.

She gets closer. She gives the lapel of his jacket a small,
affectionate tug.

JENNY (CONT'D)
Maybe we'll play again some time.

And then she turns to go. She is several steps away when
Marcus speaks.

MARCUS
Hey...

She stops and turns to him. He has a hard time finding the
words.

MARCUS (CONT'D)
Why do you keep coming back? Why do
you...like it here so much?

She smiles. She looks around at the people, the buildings,
the traffic, the life.
111.

JENNY
What's not to like?

And then she turns and walks away. Marcus watches her go,
until she is lost in the crowd.

Jenny walks through the crowd, smiling. A small dog growls
at her, then barks. The dog's owner, an OLDER WOMAN, tries
to calm the dog. Jenny walks toward us. When she's so close
that her face almost fills the screen, her face reveals the
demon. She looks directly at us, and screams.

CUT TO BLACK:

THE END
