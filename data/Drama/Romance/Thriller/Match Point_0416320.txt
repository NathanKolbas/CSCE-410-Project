MATCHPOINT

Dreamworks SKG
°@ EXT. TENNIS COURT -- DAY
In slow motion, a tennis ball passes back and forth.

CHRIS (V.0.)
The man who said "I'd rather be
lucky than good" saw deeply into
life. People are afraid to face how
great a part of life is dependent
on luck. It's scary to think so
much is out of one’s control --
there are moments in a match when
the batl hits the top of the net,
and for a split second it can
either go forward...or fall back.
With a little luck, it goes
forward...and you win. Or maybe it
doesn't...and you lose.

FADE TO BLACK:

EXT. TENNIS CLUB LONDON ~~ DAY

Chris walks along a fence. He carries a letter and
@ familiarizes himself with the tennis club manager's name.

Yes. I had a good deal of
experience.

TOWNSEND
Yeah, so I see. And I've heard very
good things. You don't miss playing
professionally?

CHRIS

(sighs)
Thank God every day I don't have to
do it. I hate the whole tennis tour
thing. Constant travelling and I
was never going to be Rusedski or
Agassi. You have to really want it.
Not that I have their talent.

TOWNSEND
Well, your credentials and
references are excellent. And you
want to live in London?

CHRIS
Very much. Very much.

Yeah. We've got a box and someone's
hot coming. It's La bloody
Traviata.

CHRIS
My God. I'd love to. Are you sure
it's not an imposition? Can I at

some serious cocktail'’s to start

making.
: (to Chris)
Irish ~- Have you ever had a Cuba

Libre or a Caipirinha?

TOM
Well it's really boring for him to
play with me but he’s a good sport.
And anyway...you've got better legs
than I've got. Chop-chop.

CHRIS
Don't be silly. I teach people who
have never held a racket.

you get to be so good, anyway? Tom
says you. played some of the greats.

. CHRIS
For me, it was a way out of a poor
existence. Caught the eye of a good
coach. I don't know. It all came so
easy at first.
12

CHLOE
Do you enjoy teaching?

CHRIS
Not really. I mean, it’s okay for
now but I'd cut my throat if I
thought I had to do it forever. I'd
like to do something with my life.
You know, special. I'd like to make
a contribution.

CHLOE
So you're a poor boy from Ireland
come to London.

CHRIS
I love it. It’s so exciting and
alive. I've never seen so much art
or theatre. Not that I've taken
much advantage of it yet.

CHLOE
Well, look, if you'd like someone
to show you around...I grew up in
Belgravia, I'd be happy to take you
to all the good places.

CHRIS
That'd be great. On one condition:
I buy the tickets.

CHLOE
Oh dear, is that going to be an
issue?

CHRIS

I'm afraid it is, I'm very old
fashioned. But actually I did read
something about the exhibition in
the Saatchi Gallery.

CHLOE
That's perfect. It'd be my pleasure
to take you.

CHRIS

You're very kind to offer this. Can
I at least give you some free
tennis lessons?

CHLOE
Okay, it's a deal. How about
Wednesday for the Saatchi?

I can do that.

CHLOE
Shall we meet for lunch first?

Chris enters, brushing off his suit jacket. He passes through
a doorway and into the library, then down another corridor,
and approaches a ping pong table.

NOLA (0.5.)
So -~ who's my next victim? You?

CHRIS
I haven't played table tennis in
quite a while.

NOLA
Would you like to play for a
thousand pounds a game?

CHRIS
What did I walk into?

They play. Chris smashes the ping pong ball across the table.
He smiles.

NOLA
What did I walk into?
CHRIS
It's like this. May I?
NOLA
Please.
CHRIS

You have to lean in...and hit
through the ball.

NOLA
I was doing just fine until you
showed up.

CHRIS
Ah, the story of my life. So tell
me...what's a beautiful young
American ping-pong player doing
mingling amongst the British upper
class?

NOLA
Did anyone ever tell you you play a
very aggressive game?

CHRIS
Did anyone ever tell you you've
very sensual lips?

NOLA.
Extremely aggressive.

CHRIS
I'm naturally competitive. Is it
off putting?

NOLA
I'll have to think about that for a
while.

TOM (0.5.)

Bh, there you are. I wanted to
introduce you to Chris Wilton...

Tom enters, clutching a drink.

TOM
: Chris Wilton this is Nola Rice. My
fiancee.
NOLA

Aha ~~ so you're the tennis pro,

15

TOM

He kisses her on the cheek.

CHRIS
...My pleasure.

NOLA
He was trying to have his way with
me over the table,

TOM
Oh really? Yeah, well, you'd better
watch out for this one. He's made a
living out of hustling.

NOLA
I'll be ready for you next time.

She turns, kisses Tom.

NOLA
I'll see you outside.
TOM
Oh yeah.
She exits.
TOM
(sighs)

She's quite something, isn't she.

CHRIS
How long have you been together?

TOM
Oh, six months...Jesus, yeah, six
months! She came over to study
acting and I met her at a party
that I'd crashed and she'd crashed
and one thing led to another.
Obviously it's taken mother quite a
long time to get used to the idea
that I'm serious but to be honest
with you, mother’s always had this

- funny little agenda for me which

doesn’t really involve marrying a
struggling actress. Especially an
American one. But I am crazy about
her.

(MORE)
16

TOM (cont'd)
Anyway, I think we should all go to
dinner next week. What do you
think?

CHRIS
I'd love to.

Excellent. Now, Irish, how about a

supper?

Why not.

hurt to have a few more pupils.

CHLOE
Do you need money?

CHRIS
God, no. I'm fine. It's very sweet
of you to ask but I don't.

CHLOE
I'm only asking because I care
about you.

They kiss passionately.

CHLOE

ELEANOR
You've been seeing a lot of Chris
Wilton lately, I understand.

CHLOE
Yeah. He's very nice,

ELEANOR
I liked him. I just don't
understand what he's aiming for.

CHLOE
He certainly doesn't want to be a
tennis pro for the rest of his
life.

Alec, seated nearby, overhears.

ALEC
Well, I find him very likeable.
He's found his way up the only way
open to him and he's not trivial. I
had a very interesting conversation
with him the other day about
Dostoyevsky.

CHLOE
Can't we do something for him? A
place in one of your companies or
something?

ALEC
Has he expressed a desire?

CHLOE
No, but he’s open, you know, about
his future.

ALEC
Uh-huh.

CHLOE
He really wants to make something
of his life.

ELEANOR
Chloe -- be careful. Tom’s involved
. with a woman I have reservations
about. Don't rush off.

CHLOE
Tom's happy with Nola. You're
prejudiced cause she's American.
19

ELEANOR
She's spoiled and temperamental.

CHLOE
She's an actress, they're
emotional.

ELEANOR
She’s deluding herself and she's
moody. She’s not right for Tom.

ALEC
Who are you talking about?

ELEANOR
Nola.

ALEC
Ooh.

Chloe enters a restaurant and spots Chris seated at the bar.
She walks over to him.

CHLOE
Have you been waiting ages?

CHRIS
Hello. Not at all.

CHLOE
Traffic was awful. The others'1ll be
here in a minute. They're probably
stuck in it somewhere.
(to waiter)
Can I have a champagne cocktail,
please?

CHRIS
One of your father’s associates
spoke to me today about the
possibility of a job. Did you say

anything?
CHLOE
e Look, I just told papa to keep his
eyes open if anything juicy opened
up.

(MORE )
20

CHLOE (cont'd)
So you could have first option...if
you wanted it. You're not cross are

you?

CHRIS
God, no. It's extremely thoughtful
of you.

The waiter brings Chloe's drink.

CHRIS
Thanks.

CHLOE
What do you think?

CHRIS
I'm gonna have to think about it.
I've never really seen myself in
the business world.

CHLOE
Mhh-hmm. So, what do you see for
yourself, you know, in the future?

CHRIS
I don't know really. I mean, I'm
sure its a great opportunity.

CHLOE
I'm think it is. Papa said it's a
chance to learn the business. And
if things go well, he'll see to it,
you know...that you move up quickly
or whatever.

CHRIS
I've always felt so-so about office
work.

CHLOE

It's not exactly office work, Think
of it more as a stepping stone.

CHRIS
To...?

CHLOE
To a bigger job, more
responsibility, greater earning
potential, I don't know. You've
always said how much you admire
Papa's accomplishments.
They kiss.

21

CHRIS
Of course. I mean -- it's strange
but coming where I come from, I've
always admired men like your
father. Wealthy but not stuffy.
Enjoying his fortune. Having a
grand time, supporting the arts.

CHLOE
Well, he'd really like to open some
doors for you, that's all.

CHRIS
He's a very generous man.

CHLOE
He respects how you've pulled
yourself up against the odds...
You don't seem very enthusiastic.

CHRIS
I'm sorry. I hope my hesitation
isn't upsetting.

CHLOE
No, no, not at all. It’s just that,
you know, you've always talked
about making a contribution
and...I'm sorry.

CHRIS
I will. I promise.

Chloe sees Tom and Nola enter the restaurant. She waves.

CHRIS
Oh good.

CHLOE
Hello.

TOM
Hi, guys.

Chloe and Nola begin chattering.

Chris pulls the chair out for Chloe as she seats herself at a

Tom nods,

CHLOE

TOM
It's my fault. I dragged Nola to
the classic car show at ExCel.

CHLOE
Really?

TOM
It was unbelievable. I swear my
trousers have barely dried.

CHLOE
Oh God. Shut up.

TOM
Well you love your cars, though,
don't you Chris?

CHRIS

I think the old ones are beautiful.
TOM

Ah.
NOLA

Yeah, I like the old ones. But Tom
likes .all those new ones with the
gadgets and...

raises his eyebrows.

NOLA
I want an Aston Martin.

CHRIS
I drive an Aston Martin.

TOM
Really?
23

CHRIS
Yeah, I used to work for a man and
I used to wash his cars for him. He
was very, very particular about...

Chloe turns and takes a menu from the waiter.

CHLOE
Thank you.

CHRIS
.».taking care of them so I had to
wash them every day with a
toothbrush.

NOLA
I want as Aston Martin or one of
those vintage convertibles.

TOM
Well, when we're married we'll
collect vintage cars. Just as long
as I can have a DB9 with all the
e@ trimmings. Okay?

He kisses her.

TOM
In fact, Hedley is perfect for
keeping all those cars. In fact,
speaking of Hedley...

CHLOE
Should we order, cause he's
waiting...

TOM
Oh, frightfully sorry.

TOM
I’1l have the baked potato with
truffles. That'll be lovely. Yum-

yum.

NOLA
I'd like the same, please.

Nothing to start?

@ ron

Oh, I think the wine list.

CHLOE
I'll have the caviar blinis,
please.

CHRIS

Er, roast chicken.

CHLOE
God, boring! Honestly, they have
the greatest caviar blinis here.
You should try them.

CHRIS
That's okay.

He passes her the menu.

CHLOE
No, do you like caviar?
CHRIS
So-so.
CHLOE
So-so?
CHLOE

He's been brought up as a good boy
to always order modestly. I'm very
sorry.

TOM
He'1l have the blinis.

CHLOE
My goodness, was your father an oil
rigger who specialized in
etiquette?

CHRIS
Er, he was kind of austere.

CHLOE
Chris' dad was a bit of a religious
fanatic.

TOM
Oh Christ.

CHRIS
After he lost both his legs he
found Jesus.
25

TOM
God. Sorry, but it just doesn't
seem like a fair trade.

CHLOE
What were you saying about Hedley?
TOM
Oh, papa’s invited us for some
shooting.
CHLOE
Oh, really?
TOM
Mmm—hmm.
NOLA

Guess I'd better bring a different
change of clothes. I don't think
your mother appreciated what I
brought last time.

TOM
I think that was your swimsuit.
She's just used to slightly more
fabric.

CHLOE
I'm sure if she knew you'd worn it
in a movie she'd suddenly find it
chic.

TOM
True.

CHRIS
Have you done many movies?

NOLA
It was a commercial, not a movie.

TOM
But your eyes went straight to her,
if you know what I mean.

NOLA
I don't think my career has really
gone as planned.

TOM
Oh, you just need a break.
 

26

CHRIS
I think it's important to be lucky
in anything.

CHLOE
Well, I don't believe in luck. I
believe in hard work.

TOM
Mmm.

CHRIS
Oh, hard work is mandatory, but...I
mean, it seems scientists are
confirming more and more that all
existence is here by blind chance.
No purpose. No design.

CHLOE
Well, I don't care. I love every
minute of it.

CHRIS
And I envy you for it.

TOM
What was it...the, er...the vicar
used to say? "Despair is the path
of least resistance." It was
something odd, wasn't it. It was
very strange...

CHRIS
I think that faith is the path of
least resistance.

TOM
Oh God.
CHLOE
Oh God. Can we change the subject,
please?
TOM
Oh God.
CHLOE

Nola was talking about acting which
is much more interesting.

TOM
Mmm.
27

NOLA
No, I was just saying that I think
I'm giving acting a second thought.
I just can't bear people in my
hometown to think I’ve failed. Not
that I'm ever going back to
Colorado. Ever.

The waiter returns.

You're so much more on the ball

Ah, Puligny-Montrachet. I never
heard of it before Tom ordered it.
Now I'm addicted.

CHLOE
Tom and Nola invited us to go and

told them we're busy.

CHRIS

no special plans.

@ CHLOE

I thought we said we'd stay in?

CHRIS
Yeah, but it wasn't written in
stone? We could've joined them.

CHLOE
We still can if you'd prefer it,

CHRIS
It's not a case of preferring it.
It's just we always have fun with
them and -- you love films.

CHLOE
Well shall I call them?

CHRIS
I mean, sure, unless you'd rather
not.

CHLOE
Well...it might be more fun just
the two of us. The wine, the
opera...

CHRIS
Mmmm...Absolutely. I just figured,
we can stay in any, any night
and...they’re free and suggested a
film. What’s the film?

CHLOE
I don't know, but if you'd prefer
it...

CHRIS

I am in the mood for a film.

taught. You should see my sister.
She's...she's very beautiful but
she's lost in drugs and...

CHRIS
I'm sure she's not more beautiful
that you are.

NOLA
What I am is sexy. But Linda -~ my
sister -- is classically beautiful.
CHRIS
So you are aware of your affect on
men?
NOLA

Before my parents split they used
to put her in these pageants.

CHRIS
Mmm—hmm.

NOLA
It's just a joke.

CHRIS
What did your father do?

NOLA
Um..-he left. And never sent any
money. And my mother could never
hold down a job.

CHRIS
No?

NOLA
No. Her problem was that she drank.

CHRIS
Mmm. How did you meet Tom?

NOLA
Um, We met at a party. He saw me
across the room and he honed in on
me like a guided missile. And I
liked him right off. You know, I
thought, um, well I think he's very
handsome. Don't you?

CHRIS
Very. And he asked you to marry
him?

NOLA

Mmm. Well, he swept me off of my
feet with presents and you
know...what did I know about that
kind of life? I'm just a starving
actress from Boulder, Colorado.
36

CHRIS
Mmm.

NOLA
Mmm. I had another bad marriage
behind me. That's another reason
she hates me.

CHRIS
Who?

NOLA
Eleanor. Tom's mother. She wants
him to marry this girl named Olivia
who I think is a distant cousin. I
don’t know. It’s, it's sick. It's
such an inbred family. It's...

CHRIS
And was it love at first sight for
you too?

NOLA

Um...I thought he was very
handsome. You know, and I told you
I was just...I was overwhelmed with
attention. So, what about you and
Chloe?

CHRIS
She's very sweet.

NOLA
Mmm. She is very sweet. And she
wants to marry you.

CHRIS
I don't think her mother would
approve of that either.

NOLA
No. No, it's different. I don't buy
into Eleanor, and she knows it, but
you...are being groomed.

CHRIS
Mom.

NOLA
You mark my words. They almost died
when they thought Chloe had run off
with some guy that ran a gastro pub
in the city.

NOLA (cont'd)
But...you're gonna do very well for
yourself -- unless you blow it.

CHRIS
And how am I going to blow it?

NOLA
By making a pass at me.

CHRIS
And what makes you think that's
gonna happen?

NOLA
Men always seem to wonder. They
think I'd be something very
special.

CHRIS
And are you?

NOLA
Well noone's ever asked for their
money back.
CHRIS
Where was ali this confidence when
you needed it in the audition?

that the company would pay for?

CHRIS
I don't know.

ALEC
I've had very good feedback on your
work, and the beginning of next
year there's going to be a very
significant position opening up.
One that carries a great deal of
responsibility and pays
accordingly. Plus there are a
number of perks: expense account,
driver, etcetera. We had been
focusing on someone else, but it’s
obvious. to me that you and Chloe
have become close, although I
wouldn't consider it if I didn't
think you were qualified.

Well, I'm sure something worthwhile
will come along.

Unfortunately, there's just not

great for.

Eleanor, seated nearby, reacts.

ELEANOR

So how long do you keep it up?
NOLA

How long?
ELEANOR

Well if time passes and nothing
significant materializes, how long
do you keep on going before you
decide that...to try something
else?

TOM
I hardly think Nola’s reached that
point, mother.

Al

cur TO:
 

42

ELEANOR
I'm not saying that. All I'm saying
is you give acting a try for a time
and if you keep being disappointed
you have to ask yourself the
question: "Is this really what I
want in my life? Is this...what I
want?"

NOCLA
Well I do ask myself that.

ELEANOR
See? It's only logical, Tom.
Especially for a woman. It's a
particularly cruel business for a
woman, and as you get older, and
time passes, if nothing happens it
gets harder and harder.

ALEC
Eleanor, Nola isn't exactly over
the hill.
ELEANOR
I'm not saying "now".
ALEC
Oh.
ELEANOR

But I'm a great one for facing up
to realities.

TOM
Well your take on these realities
is your own opinion and nothing
else. And frankly, not everybody
else is interested in hearing about
then.

ALEC
Tom, don't you raise your voice to
your mother, please.

ELEANOR |
Well...

TOM
I'm not raising my voice. And I'm
sorry, papa, but she's always on
Nola'’s case, continually
discouraging her via...innuendoes,
43

ELEANOR

All. I'm saying is acting's so will-
o'-the-wisp. Those that have it
know it right off. To pursue it
because you don‘t want to admit
defeat to friends back home is,
frankly, unrealistic. I'm sorry but
that's the way I feel.

NOLA
Excuse me,

TOM
Nola ~-

NOLA
It's okay. I'd like to be alone,
thanks.

Nola turns and goes.

TOM
(to Eleanor)
Well thank you very much. And I'm
sorry if I'm raising my voice now

heel emotionally.

Chris enters the corridor and walks up to her.

CHRIS
Why have you been so cold to me?

NOLA
TI haven't been cold.

CHRIS
Yes you have. Ever since we came
back from the countryside, you've
been distant, evasive.

NOLA
I don't want to encourage anything.
What happened, happened, Chris. I
mean, the moment was very out of
control for many reasons. I was
upset, I was drinking, and the
storm was overpowering.

CHRIS
Oh, stop rationalizing.

I'm not rationalizing. Passions are
passions but we're both very
involved with other people.

turns on whether the ball goes over
the net or comes right back at you?

HENRY
I always admired your game though,
you know?

You were very steady. Cool under
pressure but creative. You could be

beat yourself. I'm telling you, a

because it's just right in the

a natural success I think, because
you're great at picking out
paintings and bric-a~brac.

HEATHER
Yeah.

CHLOE
Knowing my luck, I'1l get pregnant
the minute it opens.

Yeah, well, you can manage both. I

giving up Adair when we first had

Rosie.

mean she still looks great. Sorry
but it's true. Er -- but
something's just...changed in her
face. I mean I, we barely spoke.

HEATHER
Tom said she looked a bit hard.

TOM
Yeah, well, she's always, you know,
been a lady of the sauce so to
speak. And I think it kind of runs
in the family, but...I don’t know.
I mean she’s still got that "come

me.

Me?

BURT
Yeah, you were hailing a cab on
Melcombe Street about, er, what,
five o'clock? I'd have given you a
lift.

I was?

Where's Melcombe Street?

CHRIS
No, not me.

BURT
Yes -- I mean it certainly looked
like you.

CHLOE

Where is Melcombe Street?

CHRIS
No, I'm afraid you‘re mistaken. But
people are always taking me for
other people. So...

BURT
I'd have sworn it was you.

CHLOE
Well, it certainly wouldn't be
Chris hailing a cab. He's
completely dependant on our driver.
Very annoying.

TOM
Quite right.

BURT
You should check for early
Alzheimer's, you're forgetting. I'm
sure I'm right.

CHRIS
No, you are mistaken. But...thank
you for thinking of me.

TOM
I think the only thing that comes
out of this conversation is that
you're both nuts.

Yeah, well, you're an authority on
that.

Look, we'd better be going. Look,

genuine passion not as part of some
fertility project.

CHRIS
Well I'll go with you and we'll get
it sorted.

NOLA
I'm not doing that again.

CHRIS
Again? What's that supposed to

getting pregnant?

CHRIS
I just...feel so guilty. So
terribly guilty.

CHLOE
Listen, Chris, we've both been to
the doctor. We're both perfectly
healthy. I can conceive and you're
perfectly capable of making a woman
pregnant. Is it me? Have I been
horribly pushy and obnoxious on the

I want to have our baby. We haven't
been lucky yet, that's all.

Oh, Chloe.

I'm not saying I don't love her.
Just not in the way I feel about

Right.

CHRIS

Maybe it's finally the difference
between love and lust. But what the

Hey. Keep your voice down. You know

ALEC
We're structuring something with a

my thought was, anyone in on the

hugely, assuming our predictions
are correct, and they are.

Eleanor enters.

ALEC
Eleanor, I've just told Chris the
good news.

ELEANOR

want her to know what I was talking
about.

NOLA
Well, she has to know eventually.

Nola, stop!

We don't have to have a child
together. It would make life a hell

Yeah, simpler for you but not for
me.

CHRIS

It occurred to me that even if you
had the child, I could help you out
financially.

NOLA
That's not enough.

CHRIS
Nola, be reasonable.

NOLA
That's exactly what Tom said when
he broke off our engagement. Being
reasonable got me where I am right
now.

CHRIS
So you're threatening me? If I
don't do what you say, you're gonna
go to my wife?

NOLA
Were you lying to me? All those
times we made love, all those
conversations, were you lying to me
then?

Of course I wasn't lying.

Chris Wilton...Detective Banner.

CHRIS
Good afternoon.

Chris shakes Banner's hand.

BANNER
How do you do? Take a seat.
- CHRIS
Thank you.
BANNER

This is nothing to be alarmed

about. We're just doing a routine
investigation into the Betty Eastby-
Nola Rice murders.

CHRIS
Mmm—hmm.

BANNER
Were you acquainted with either of
the victims?

CHRIS
Peripherally I knew Nola Rice.
121

BANNER
How?

CHRIS
She was engaged for a time to the
man who's now my brother-in~law.

BANNER
That's, uh, Tom Hewett?

CHRIS
That's correct. Er, they broke up.
A year ago. More.

BANNER
Mmm-hmm. When did you last see her?

CHRIS
Oh God, I can't remember...At the
Tate Modern. My wife and I ran into
her. But that was a long time ago.

BANNER
Have you seen her since?

CHRIS
Not that I recall.

BANNER
Have, um...have you ever seen this?

Banner removes a diary from an evidence baq.

CHRIS
No...What is it?
BANNER
Are you aware that Nola Rice kept a
diary?
CHRIS
No.
BANNER
As you can see...you're all over
it.
. CHRIS

Yes, I can see that.
 

122

BANNER
Do you still claim that you haven't
seen her except for more that a
year ago at the Tate Modern?

CHRIS
You can't blame me for trying to
hide the fact that I had an affair
with her. But you people have to
protect me here. I hope you don't
think IT had anything to do with her
murder?

BANNER
How long did your affair go on?

CHRIS
It began casually when she was
still engaged to Tom. They broke
up, she moved away. She came back
and IT ran into her at the Tate
Modern and it began again. God,
have a heart. My wife is gonna have
a baby. This will devastate her.

BANNER
Did you promise that you were going
to leave your wife and marry Miss
Rice?

CHRIS
No, I did not. I mean, it's
possible that she had that fantasy,
And obviously she wrote that I did,
but I tried to finesse that point
with her. I didn't want the sexual
relationship to end but I'm not
gonna break up my home. My wife and
I are trying very hard to have a
baby. We've seen several fertility
doctors. You can check that out if
you like but I beg you to be
discreet.

BANNER
But you did lead her on...so that
she had the impression you were
unhappy at home.

CHRIS
I tried te tip-toe around it and
not lead her on but she's going to
believe what she wants to believe.
(MORE)
123

CHRIS (cont'd)

Look, don't irresponsibly run
roughshod over this and wreck
people's lives. I mean, there is no
case because I would not harm
anyone, much less Nola Rice. Isn't
it obvious that somebody killed her
neighbor and she walked in when it
was happening? God, I beg you,
don't go on a fishing expedition
over this and wreck people's lives.
My family, my marriage is at stake.

BANNER
We just have to check out
everything in a murder case.

CHRIS
Okay, but I'm not your man. I know
it's not the most honourable thing
to cheat on your wife but that does
not make me a murderer.

BANNER
We're obligated to review the
situation. I understand it's
sensitive stuff for you. And if we
have to talk to you again we'll do
everything in our power to keep it
very private. Your personal life's
your own. We're not making any
moral judgements, just
investigating a crime.

CHRIS
I understand. Look, if you have to
get.in contact with me again,
which, God in heaven, I hope you
don't, please call me on my mobile.
I'll leave you my number...

BANNER
Thanks. Oh, um, one other thing. Do
you own or have access to a
shotgun?

CHRIS
Me? No. Um, my father-in-law shoots
on the estate but not me. You can
check it out but, er, I beg you to
consider mine and his position.

BANNER
Of course.
124

CHRIS
Thank you.

Chris stands, shakes Banner's hand, then exits. Banner turns
his attention to Detective Dowd.

BANNER
So, what do you think?

DOWD
I think it's what it looks like.
Someone robbed and killed Mrs.
Eastby, was surprised leaving, and
killed Nola Rice.

BANNER
Yeah, I know. I know, it's got drug
robbery written all over it.

DOWD
He's ‘specting a baby. Okay, he's
not gonna win a medal for fidelity
but we can find out discreetly
enough whether the Hewetts had a
shotgun unaccounted for. I don't
think that he would know the first
thing about stealing one though.
Wever mind sawing one off. It's a
bit of a stretch. He's got no
previous convictions. Not even a
speeding ticket. The coroner says
that Eastby was killed first.

BANNER
Yeah.

DOWD
There's no sign of a forced entry.

BANNER
So, Mrs. Eastby knew the killer if
she let him in.

DOWD
Well, come on, Mike. Ninety per
cent of the crimes we go out on,
people open their doors and invite
- the criminals in.

BANNER
Yeah, I know, you're right. I'm
just thinking out loud. It's just
he’s got a real motive.
125

DOWD
Yeah, maybe.

BANNER
I'm torn because the Rice murder
was Clearly an afterthought but I'd
ilove to pursue it a little more.
But I'm reluctant to fish around
and cause problems for everybody.

DOWD
Well, if something develops, we can
pursue it. I doubt if anything's
gonna drop into our laps.

It's as we speculated and said was

(MORE)
127

BANNER (cont'd)
He killed the next-door neighbor
first to throw us off the scene,
and set up the appearance of a
robbery. He waited in the hall. He
knew she'd be back the same time as
usual and he killed her making it
seem like she surprised a burglar
running out. He planned it all so
he could make the theatre in time
to strengthen his alibi if one
became necessary. Now, I haven't
figured out the weapon problem, and
I know it's a lot to ask a jury but
the correctness of it came to me in
my sleep, and I am going to break
this case.

DOWD
I hate to be the bearer of bad
news, Mike.

BANNER
What?

DOWD
Not that your dream isn't of
primary interest to a jury.

BANNER
What's the bad news?

DOWD
There was another shooting in the
area last night, four a.m. A drug
addict killed. Looks like a drug
sale turned nasty.

BANNER
What, and he confessed to killing
two women before he died?

DOWD
No, he didn't have to. The old
woman's wedding ring was right in
his pocket.

BANNER
No.

DOWD
Name and date engraved right on it.

BANNER
I don't believe it.
128

DOWD.
I know. I know. Your case looked
good, lots of motive. But his
motive was pretty strong, too.
Heroin. Junkie with a long sting of
convictions. Killed by one of his
own, no doubt.

(beat)

come on, I'll buy you breakfast.
You can traumatize me with the rest
of your dreams.

BANNER
No, wait. What if Wilton did it,
threw the jewels away, this guy
finds them.

DOWD
I don't know. See what tonight's
dream tell you. I'm sure a jury'11l
be interested. Come on.

BANNER
I give up.

DOWD
I knew Wilton didn't do it. He's
another poor schmuck who cheated on
his wife. When you see those
pictures of Nola Rice, you can see
why though, eh? :

BANNER
What a world. Am I right, eh?
