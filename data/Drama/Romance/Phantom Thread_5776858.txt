ALMA
It‘s beautiful. she’s beautiful.

REYNOLDS
This was for her second husband,

for the wedding, My father had died, many
years before...#e lived with a evil Nanny
Blackwood, who, because of superstition
wouldn't help me sew the dress — she believed
it would bring her bad fortune, to never be a
bride, not that anyone would have had her, she
seemed ancient to us — I don’t know how old
she was - so I sewed alone, for months &
months..sweating and sewing, hunched over...

Hateful Nanny Blackwood never married anyway!
(all the help I could have had from hex...)

I shaped the form of it on my Sister,
my first mannequin

There are endless superstitions when making a
wedding dress. Girls afraid they will never
marry if they touch it, models afraid they'll
marry only bald men if they wear the dress.

CU. PHOTOGRAPH. The dress is beautiful.

ALMA
Where is the dress now?
