THIRD DRAFT
January 3; 1960
Thou hast conquered, 0 pale Galilean;
The world has grown grey from thy breath;
We have drunken of things Lethean,
And fed on the fullness of death.
Laurel is green for a season,
And love is sweet for a day;
But love grows bitter with treason,
And laurel outlives not May.

"THE FINAL CONFLICT"
FADE IN
INT. SUBWAY - EXTENSION - DAY 1

A vast mechanical mole driller moves along a pair of rails
towards the clay face of a tunnel. Its head consists of a
huge wheel armed with blades, like a turbo-engine, revolving
around a hollow snout. The head comes to rest against the
clay. <A pause, then the wheel starts to spin with a
deafening ROAR, cutting into the clay.

At the rear end of the mole driller, a conveyor belt carries
large lumps of debris clay back along the tunnel, watched
by a couple of WORKMEN. One of them moves forward as he
notices something.

1ST WORKMAN
(calling)
Hey, hold it!

The 2nd Workman shouts back above the roar of the drill:

2ND WORKMAN
What's the matter?

1ST WORKMAN
We hit something. Kill ita
minute.

2ND WORKMAN
(calling to
Operator)
Kill it, Frank!

The two Workmen inspect the conveyor belt, which contains
large chunks of brickwork among the lumps of clay. The ROAR
of the drill stops.

1ST WORKMAN
(te 2nd Workman)
What is it?

2ND WORKMAN
(shrugging)
Forget it. I thought we'd hit
a bank vault or something.

A SUPERVISOR comes over to the SURVEYOR.

SUPERVISOR
What's going on?

We hit some brickwork.

SURVEYOR

Oh, that's nothing -- just the
foundations of the old
Thorn Museum...

(shows the Supervisor

the Plan Sheet)
See? That's the basement wall
of the building there...or what
was left of it after the fire.

SUPERVISOR
What fire?

SURVEYOR
Oh, years ago...some guy set
fire to the Thorn Museum --
burnt the place to the ground.

SUPERVISOR
Nothing for us to worry about?

SURVEYOR
Hell no, the East River Park's
the only thing up there now.

SUPERVISOR
(to 1st Workman)
Okay, let's go.

2ND WORKMAN
(calling)
Let's go, Frank!

SUPERVISOR
(to @nd Workman)
I want you to take a look at
the hydraulic on four, I think
we need a new piston-head...

The 2nd Workman follows the Supervisor and Surveyor away,
leaving the lst Workman alone to watch the conveyor belt,

CLOSE SHOT: The blades of the mole digger begin to rotate,
eating into the tunnel face and sucking great boulders of
clay into its hollow snout.

The lst Workman starvis by the conveyor belt, idly watching
the monotonous hunk. of debris flowing by. Again he spots
something: a glint ov metal, poking out from a large boulder
of clay. He is about to call out, then changes his mind and
hauls it off the belt as it passes him,

The boulder falls to the ground, breaking into lumps and
revealing several metal objects as well as old bones, stained
brown by the clay. The Workman kneels down and extracts one
of the objects, rubbing the clay away with his fingers.

THEME and MAIN TITLE SUPERIMPOSE OVER the object in CLOSE SHOT:
a rusty dagger, its handle bearing an effigy of Christ
erucified on the Cross.

The Workman locks behind him to make sure no one is watching,
then hides the dagger inside his overalls and hurriedly
begins to salvage the others.

(MAIN THEME AND CREDITS CONTINUE OVER). The Workman enters a
pawn shop, goes to the counter, takes out a pouch and unties

INT, VIEWING THEATRE - THORN COMMERCIAL - DAY 14

FADE UP ON the SOUND and VISION of a blizzard at full force,
sweeping across a primeval desert canyon. The blizzard

reaches its peak, then slowly begins to subside as twilight
approaches, revealing a snow-covered landscape, devoid of life.

MIX TO:

The same landscape at night: a white wilderness, shimmering
and still in the moonlight. A pseudoclassical MUSICAL SCORE
FADES IN, followed by the VOICE of a NARRATOR well-versed in
the art of supplying slick voice overs to commercials.

NARRATOR
(voice over)

Fifty thousand years ago, mankind
faced its first major threat of
extinction. A devastation wrought
by nature. The Ice Age. It
lasted five thousand years.
Rendered four-fifths of the earth's
surface uninhabitable. And
wiped out all but the hardiest
of nature's creations...

The darkened interior of a cave is illuminated by the first
rays of dawn, picking out a series of primitive cave drawings
on the wall.

NARRATOR

(voice over)
One of those few was man. From
that devastation dawned a new age
-- and anew hope, Phoenix-like,
man arose from the frozen
wilderness. And set forth upon
his dream...

CAMERA PANS OFF the wall and ONTO the entrance of the cave.
With cliched symbolism, it ZOOMS WITH the Narrator's words
into the rising sun beyond.

MIX To:

CAMERA ZOOMS OUT FROM a different sun, PANNING DOWN ONTO a
VISTA SHOT OF an African plantation destroyed by drought.

NARRATOR
(voice over)

Mankind has endured many catastrophes
since then, but none so grave as the
one which faces him today. The
economic crisis of the past decade

has brought inflation, famine and
chaos to every corner of the globe...

A MONTAGE of STOCK SHOTS illustrates the narration: starving
Blacks, diseased Children, civil uprisings, dole queues etc,

The commercial is being screened in a darkened viewing
theatre, watched by a group of Businessmen.

NARRATOR

(voice over)
Some label it the Great Recession,
others are calling it Armageddon
-~- that final upheaval of the
world foretold by the prophets
of old. But amid all the pessimism,
one voice rings out its faith
in the future. The voice of Thorn...

The commercial shows an impressive UPSOT OF the Thorn Building:
a glittering skyscraper, shining like a beacon in the night
sky, its lighted windows forming a giant "T",

NARRATOR
(voice over)
Wherever famine or disease has
struck, the Thorn Corporation
has been first in the field...

A map of the world lights up with hundreds of bulbs indicating
the scope of Thorn overseas...

NARRATOR

(voice over)
»..Waging a relentless war on
want by channeling its resources,
technology and research into
projects that not only aid and
relieve the suffering, but lay
the foundation to the future
prosperity of all.

The Thorn Corporation's logo and two-bar jingle ends the
commercial, followed by the throaty, coaxing voice of a
and Narrator;

2ND NARRATOR
(voice over)
Thorn,,.the World's Leading
Light in Building a New Tomorrow.

The houselights come up in the viewing theatre as the end-
leader flashes through the projector.

Sitting in the front row is DAMIEN THORN. Now aged thirty-two,
Damien combines androgynous good looks with a disarming,
charismatic charm. There is an underlying sexuality to his
character, which attracts both men and women to him.

Cont.

Sitting next to him are his personal aide, HARVEY DEAN, and
his P.R, Chief, STIGWELL. The remaining Businessmen represent
the Advertising Agency.

STIGWELL
(to Damien)
Well?

A pause,

DAMIEN
I make that four mixed metaphors,
two split infinitives, anda
floating gerundive.

The Businessmen laugh edgily.

STIGWELL
I don't think viewers pay too
much attention to that kind of
thing, Damien...

Damien gets up.

DAMIEN
No, you're right,..and they
won't pay much attention to
that kind of sanctimonious
bullshit either. I said I
wanted action, not words. I
want to see Thorn at work, not
hear about it. A thousand
starving kids clamouring for a
pellyfull of Thorn soya...Thorn
medical teams at work, Thorn
construction, Thorn engineering
-..sinstead of which you spend
half the commercial giving us a
third grade potted history of
the Ice Age.

A pause. Damien turns to Dean.
DAMIEN
Do we have any footage of the
Australian Drought Relief?
DEAN
Yes, but nothing special, and
most of it's been seen on TV
already,
Damien considers a moment.

DAMIEN
(to Stigwell)
All right, we'll find something
for you. In the meantime, go
on screening the old commercial
aoe don't want that one to go
out.

The Advertising Executives mumble "Good-bye, Mr. Thorn" as
Damien coasts out of the viewing theatre, followed by Dean,

INT, THORN BUILDING - CORRIDOR - DAY 15

Damien and Dean walk along the plush corridor back to Damien's
office,

DAMIEN
What have we got coming up?

DEAN
Botswana next week, then the
Aswan Dam at the end of the
month.

INT, THORN BUILDING - OUTER OFFICE ~ DAY 16

Damien and Dean enter a reception office and walk on through
into Damien's inner sanctum.

DAMIEN
Could we get a film unit down
to Botswana in time?

DEAN
Sure, but we can't put our
relief units in till after the
coup, and no one's too sure
how long that'll take.

INT. THORN BUILDING - DAMIEN'S OFFICE - DAY i7

Dean follows Damien into a large, panelled room, exquisitely
furnished in the style of a Regency drawing room rather than
an office. Damien goes to his desk, his mind already on
other matters as he talks to Dean.

DAMIEN
Okay, then it'll have to be the
Aswan Dam. Can you arrange for
a unit to be out there when it
goes? And make sure they give
our relief units plenty of
coverage,..don't let the Red Cross
beat them to it.

Cont.

Dean laughs, then thinks of an idea,

DEAN
Hey, why don't you go =~ that
would be a real coup --
Damien Thorn supervising relief
work in person...

Damien smiles.

DAMIEN
I've got to stay here,

DEAN
What for?

DAMIEN

To be on hand when the President
calls for me.

(pause)
He's going to offer me the post
of Ambassador to Great Britain.

Dean looks confused.

DEAN
I'm sorry -- I don't follow.

Damien smiles. A pause, then he gets up and walks over to
@ bookshelf.

DAMIEN
(casually)
Are you familiar with the
Book of Hebron?

DEAN
The book of who?

Damien reaches for a book, takes it down,

DAMIEN

It's in the Aprocrypha...one
of the more obscure back-waters
of the Septuagint Bible.

(opens the book at

@ marked passage;

reading)
‘And it shall come to pass that
in the end days the Beast shall
reign one hundred score and
thirty days and nights, and the

DAMIEN (Cont.)
faithful shall cry unto the Lord,
Wherefore art thou in the day
of evil?! And the Lord shall
hear their prayers, and out of
the angel isle he shall bring
forth a deliverer, the holy
Lamb of God, who shall do
battle with the Beast..,and
shall utterly destroy him...!'

(closes the book)
That ‘the Beast shall reign one
hundred score and thirty days
and nights! is a rather fancy
way of saying seven years --
the length of time I've been
President of the Thorn Corporation.
'and out of the angel isle the
Lord shall bring forth a
deliverer.' The angel isle --
the original Latin has 'Ex Insula
Angelorum'...England.

The implication begins to dawn on Dean.

DEAN
The second coming?

DAMIEN
Only it won't be the Beast who
is utterly destroyed, ittll
be the Nazarene,

DEAN
But what about our Ambassador
who's in Britain at the moment?

Damien turns, looks at Dean, smiles,
EXT, KENSINGTON GARDENS - LONDON - DAY 18

Early morning. A middle~aged American, faintly~distinguished,
enjoys his morning consittutional, as of habit. His pace is
leisurely, accommodating the park's wildlife: squirrels,
ducks, pigeons, children on their way to school. [In the
b.g., the distant hum of a chain saw at work.

The faintly~distinguished American AMBASSADOR wanders along
the edge of the Serpentine Lake towards the Peter Pan statue,
where a group of Japanese Tourists are taking snaps of fellow
Nippons. As the Ambassador PASSES CAMERA, a Rotweiller dog
emerges from behind the base of the statue. It observes him
a moment, then moves o.s.

cont.
A-47

il
18 cont.

The rasp of the chain saw jars in the f.g. of ANOTHER ANGLE:
Two Workmen felling a dead elm tree. The Ambassador walks
past them; the Workmen pause in their work, the saw abates,
but now another SOUND continues: a low, sustained chord,

a grating dissonance, emanating from the same key note as
the saw,

The dog disappears into the bushes on higher ground.

As the Ambassador continues walking, he becomes uneasy,
sensing a pursuer. He glances back along the path, but
there is no one. A gaggle of school children pass him in
crocodile formation, giggling at an old woman flanked by
Plastic bags, feeding ducks on the Serpentine Lake.

On higher ground, the dog moves through the bushes.

Again the Ambassador looks back, again sees nothing of
significance. The sense of menace quickens as a score of
violins are plucked in a rapid succession of butterfly
strokes rising from the basic chord (in similar style to
Penderecki's "Polymorphia for forty-eight strings").

The tow path is now deserted: a breeze stirs the overhanging
branches. The Ambassador, too dignified to run, increases
his stride.

The dog moves swiftly through the bushes, in parallel with
him, but on higher ground, then overtakes him.

The Ambassador rounds a corner, clear of the trees, and,
with a measure of relief, sights the relative sanctuary of
the Serpentine Bridge, where a hot dog van is parked, its
rear doors open.

A Tourist squirts the last of the mustard from a plastic
dispenser onto his hot dog, then moves away, The Ambassador
reaches the van, points to the hot dogs behind a glass
cabinet.

AMBASSADOR
(to the
Van Salesman)
I'll take one of those.

VAN SALESMAN
In a moment.

The SALESMAN ducks down behind the counter to refill the
mustard dispenser, The Ambassador looks back behind him,
still sensing a pursuer, but there are only park strollers
in sight. He turns back to the Salesman.

Cont.
12
18 cont.1

AMBASSADOR
Could you...

The Ambassador breaks off as the Rotwelller dog suddenly
appears over the top of the counter instead of the Salesman,
its paws splayed on the ledge. The Ambassador freezes,
caught in the gaze of the dog's penetrating eyes.

VAN SALESMAN
(voice over;
ordering dog down)
Get down from there! Go on,
‘op it!

The Van Salesman pushes the dog off the counter, throwing
it a hot dog to be rid of it.

VAN SALESMAN
{to the
Ambassador)
With or without mustard,
Guv?

The Ambassador has gone.

EXT. KENSINGTON GARDENS AND ROAD - DAY i9
The Ambassador's limousine is parked at the side of the
road; a Uniformed Chauffeur sits at the wheel, reading a
newspaper. He looks up as he sees the Ambassador hurrying
towards him, turns on the engine. But the Ambassador
strides on by, completely ignoring him.

RUSH HOUR COMMUTERS honk their horns at the Ambassador as
he jaywalks across Park Lane, seemingly oblivious to the

AMBASSADOR'S P,0.V.: The Ambassador sees his own reflection
partly superimposed by a shadowy, translucent image. It

some jackal-like animal, The image is only in the
Ambassador's imagination, for when he turns away, terrified,
his features are perfectly normal.

carried out with purpose and precision, The MUSIC is
again the low, familiar note, the jarring discord in
search of resolution,

The Ambassador rifles through his desk for something,
changes his mind, goes to a small portable typewriter and
extracts the ribbon.

The violins begin to flutter as he unravels the red and
black ribbon across the room, securing one end round the
double door handles.

Seated at his desk, the Ambassador adjusts the position
of something on the floor, The desk clock reads 2.54 p.m.

Now his work is done. He settles back in his chair to
wait. Behind him, halo-like, hangs thé Great Seal of
the United States, flanked by the Stars and Stripes.

FULL SHOT: The Ambassador enthroned at his desk, winged
by the flags of his country, crowned by the seal of

his authority. The vision is fleeting: a brief moment
of serenity before the opening doors tug the ribbon
tight, pulling the trigger on a gun wedged between his
knees and aimed at his head, The bullet rips through
the Ambassador's skull, splattering the contents of

his cranium across the Great Seal of the United States

information from local contacts.

PRESIDENT
Can you let me see it?

DAMIEN
It's quite unofficial, you

INT. TELEVISION STUDIOS - STUDIO 4 - NIGHT 58

Damien enters the darkness of the off-set studio floor, flanked
by the Two Security Men. CAMERA FOLLOWS them as the
Floor Manager leads them to the "world in Focus" set.

KATE

(voice over)
Last week Mr. Thorn arrived in
Britain to become the youngest
American Ambassador ever
appointed to what we still refer
to as our Court of St. James',
and later in the program I'll
be talking to him.

Benito watches from the shadows as Damien is escorted to the
guest chair facing Kate. Dean and the Two Security Men
remain discreetly in the b.g., out of the range of the TV
cameras and a short distance away from Benito,

KATE
But first, let's just take a
look at a few of the highlights
in a career that's already being
compared to that of the late
John F. Kennedy...

Benito eyes Dean and the Two Security Men, who are both
watching Damien. From his vantage point, Benito has
unobstructed access to his target. He puts his hand inside
his breast pocket, clutches hold of the hidden dagger ready to
strike,

ASM,
(o.s.)
Can I help you?

Benito swings round to find an ASSISTANT FLOOR MANAGER standing
behind him,

BENITO
What?

A.S.M.

BENITO

Thanks very much,

Benito backs off into the darkness in the direction of the
studio door. The A.S.M. watches him go, then turns back to
watch Kate, whose commentary has continued in the b.g.,
OVERLAPPED.

KATE

(o.s.)
«after majoring at
Yale University Damien Thorn
matriculated here at Oxford
as a Rhodes Scholar, captaining
the Oxford eight to victory in
1966, as well as winning the
Westchester Cup at Polo in the
same year...

Benito pauses in the shadows, looks back at the set. From
his P,O.V., he sees the A.S.M. glance round at him -~
catching sight of him hovering in the darkness. Again
Benito turns as if to leave, but this time the A.S.M.'s
suspicion is aroused. He walks over to the Floor Manager,
whispers something, pointing in Benito's direction. Benito
hurries towards the door, glancing round for some alternative
hiding place. He spots an iron stairway leading up to the
lighting gantry high above the studio floor...

KATE

(o.s8.)
In 1971, Damien took over the
reins of his uncle's business,
Thorn Industries, and within
seven years has turned it into
the world's largest multinational
corporation, producing everything
from nuclear armaments to soya
bean food. products...

The Floor Manager follows the A.S.M., to where they last saw
Benito, but there is now no sign of him. The Floor Manager
shrugs, returns to the set, followed by the A.S.M.

While Kate continues o.s., Benito makes his way up the metal
staircase and out onto the lighting gantry.

KATE

(o.s.)
And now, at the age of thirty-
two, Damien Thorn has entered
the political arena, not only
as U.S. Ambassador to Britain,
but as President of the
United Nations Youth Council.
In two years' time he'll be
running for the U.S. Senate,
and is already being strongly
tipped to become the youngest
United States President in
history.

CAMERA RESUMES ON Kate as she turns to Damien, sitting
opposite her.

KATE
A remarkable career for one so
young, Mr. Ambassador.

DAMIEN
(with false modesty)
Oh, I don't know. Not when you
remember that Alexander the Great
was commanding the Macedonian
Army at sixteen.

CAMERA RESUMES ON Benito as he creeps stealthily along the
gantry, glancing over the precipice edge to see how far away
he is from Damien. His VIEW is partially obscured by the
lighting boats, suspended a few feet below the gantry. He
leans forward, but his foot dislodges a loose bolt --

SHOOTING AT ground level, the bolt lands within inches of
the A.S.M., who glances up to see where it came from.

FROM Benito's P.0O.V. THROUGH the holes: the A.S.M., can be
seen as a distant figure, scanning the gantry high above him.
A pause, then he looks back at Kate and Damien. In CLOSE
SHOT, Benito sighs with relief.

Kate's interview with Damien, which has continued almost
inaudibly in the b.g., now resumes at ground level.

KATE
Of course that's how many people
view you, isn't it -- as a sort

of twentieth century Alexander,
leading the world out of the
present doldrums of recession
into @ golden era of prosperity.

to put across.

DAMIEN
The image of Thorn as a Corporation
~~ not a personal image of myself.
But I certainly hold tremendous
optimism for the future, and I
want to see Thorn play a major
part in achieving it...

CAMERA RESUMES ON Benito, who now sees that the only way he
can position himself directly above Damien is by elimbing
down from the metal gantry and striking out along one of the
lighting boats, suspended on chains from the roof. He lowers
himself over the side and slithers into the first boat, then
crawls along it on all fours.

The Damien/Kate interview resumes at ground level, LOW ANGLE.
Far above them we can dimly discern one of the lighting boats
moving slightly from side to side.

KATE
You've always taken a great
interest in youth,
Mr. Ambassador, What are your
plans now that you're President
of the U.N. Youth Council?

DAMIEN
All sorts of things, but I
believe the most important
task I have is to help young
people gain a more prominent
role in world affairs than the
one we currently afford them
+.,0r rather, deny them.
What is this arrogance that
always makes us think we know
better than them? We calli
them immature, naive...
‘Wait till you're grown up and
then we'll listen to you.’
What we really mean is 'Wait
till you're grown old, and then
you'll think the way we do.'
So youth stands aside, because
it has no other choice, and we
set to work...

benefit of the cameras --

DAMIEN
Clipped, Impotent. But above
all, safe. No wonder each...

SHCOTING ALONG the lighting boats, Benito leans over the
edge at the far end, ready to strike, Suddenly one of the
support chains in f.g. breaks loose from boat clamp...

the boat lurches forward, the sudden weight on the other
clamp causing the second chain to break free...

SHOOTING in LOW ANGLE FROM ground level: the boat takes

a nose-dive, swinging through the air like a lifeboat
suspended from one davit. Benito slides down the length of
the boat, dislodging clamps in a desperate attempt to cling
on.

KATE
(a warning cry)
Damien...!

Damien jumps clear of the set as two of the arc lamps tear
ioese from the boat and hurtle to the floor, exploding on
impact and igniting the nylon drapes.

Benito tries in vain to clutch onto the boat as he slides
eff the end, his foot caught up on the cable of one of the
lamps. He plunges towards the studio floor, but his fall
is broken short bythe cable. which proceeds to swing him

race for cover from the inferno, As Benito reaches the

catches fire.

his father in the style of a soliloquy.

O my father, Lord of Silence,
Supreme God of Desolation, whom
mankind reviles, yet aches to
embrace, strengthen my purpose
to save the world from a second
ordeal of Jesus Christ and his
grubby, mundane creed. Two
thousand years have been enough!

Damien emerges from the darkness, moving towards a crucified
effigy of Christ.

DAMIEN
Show man instead the raptures
of thy kingdom: infuse in him
the grandeur of melancholy, the
divinity of loneliness, the
purity of evil, the paradise of
pain. What perverted imagination
has fed mankind the lie that heil
festers in the bowels of the
earth? There is only one hell:
the leaden monotony of human
existence; there is only one
heaven: the ecstacy of my
father’s kingdom!

Damien turns on Christ, whom we now see to be crucified in
such @ manner that both his front and rear are visible.

DAMIEN
Nazarene charlatan, what can you
offer humanity? Since the hour
you vomited forth from the gaping
wound of a woman, you have done
nothing but crush man's soaring
desires in a deluge of
sanctimonious morality. You

you were born of an impotent
God, I was conceived of a
Jackal, born of Satan -- the
Desolate One -- the Nail. Your
pain on the cross was but a
Splinter compared to the agony
of my father: cast out from

banished, reviled!

Suddenly Damien lurches forward, grabbing the crown of thorns
in his open palms.

I would drive deeper the thorns
into your rancid carcass, you
profaner of vices, accursed
Nazarene!

by a ruined Chapel. ‘he base of the Chapel is built into
the rock face, and at first sight appears to be quite
inaccessable since the Chapel itself is perched a hundred

panting as Damien climbs the ladder outside. A pause, then he
appears in the doorway.

TRACKING IN LOW ANGLE, Damien walks into the church and
approaches a stone altar. As he reaches the steps, the

TWO FIGURES leap out at him from the shadows and hurl him face
down on the altar, each stabbing him with a dagger. We now see
that they are Brother Paulo and Brother Martin.

Damien's corpse lies face down on the altar, the daggers
plunged in his back. Brother Paulo steps forward and makes a
sign of the cross over the corpse.

PAULO
In nomine Patri, e Filii, e¢ Spiriti
Sancti...Amen.

Paule and Martin grip the corpse by the shoulders and turn him
over, reacting in horror as they recognize their victim:
Brother Matteus, his expression a death mask of terror, his
eyes rolled completely back into their sockets so that only
the glazen, milky whites are showing.

MARTIN

But...but I saw him.

Paulo glances at Martin, then turns to the high altar window,
clasping his hands in prayer:

PAULO

Rotweilier dog behind them. The TWO MONKS turn to flee, but
find that the dog is guarding the entrance to the Chapel --

HIGH ANGLE, SHOOTING DOWM FROM the altar window. Martin and
Paulo back away from the dog and turn once again towards the
altar window, reacting in horror to something o.s. BEHIND
CAMERA,

From the MONKS' P.0O.V, we see the spectral, translucent image
of a Jackal's skull, framed by the altar window and gazing in
from the darkness beyond. It is the same image seem earlier
by the American Ambassador (Scene 26), only now it is vast,
surreal, dwarfing the top of the massive stone cross in f.g.

As with the Ambassador, it is seen strictly as a P.O.V.: an
image in the mind of the beholder. The apparition is devoid of
all human features; its side-flanked eyes contain no pupiis,
only a spidery network of veins heaving in their empty sockets,
the whole pulsating as if fed by an inner glow, a phosphorescent
energy that creates a monochrome negative effect, a phantom
X-ray suspended in the void of night.

LOW ANGLE: the TWO MONKS turn sharply away from the window,
their eyes wildly searching for an escape, The window is
visible beyond them, but there is no sign of the Jackal image.

Pauio spots the opening to an old cistern well leading down to
the base of the rock. It is half-covered by a rusted grill,
leaving enough room to squeeze through the entrance.

UP SHOT; FROM inside the cistern: Paulo slithers down inside,
but reacts to the sheer drop below him. He manages to cling to
the grill as Martin follows him to relative safety.

SHOOTING CLOWN: both MONKS are now inside the cistern, clinging
to the half-open grill. A long pause, then they hear the
familiar pant of the Rotweiller dog as it ENTERS SHOT,

UP SHOT: FROM inside the cistern: Paulo and Martin look up at
the dog, staring down at them. A pause, then the grill itself
starts to slide shut, effectively entombing them in the cistern.

The Huntsren blunder through the undergrowth in pursuit of the
Hounds, the Master of Hounds howling the traditional "hollaa!"
as he sights the fox.

The fox bolts out from the far side of the copse, pursued by
the Hounds. Damien follows swiftly behind them, already in
the lead of the Hunt.

In the MONTAGE that follows, Damien is seen to be an expert
horseman, far superior to his fellow Huntsmen. Moreover his
instincts seem closer aligned to the Hounds than the riders:
the spark of the chase blazes in his eyes, the scent of the
kill flares his appetite. Gone is charade of manners adopted
by the other Huntsmen -- for perhaps the first time we see
Damien as one truly "born of the jackal"...

As the chase continues, Damien pulls way ahead of the rest of
the Hunt, overtaking many of the Hounds and effectively
splitting the pack into two.

A HORSEMAN, whom we now see to be Brother Antonio, watches the
hunt through binoculars. He is standing by the edge of a small
canal running alongside a woodland path above the field. A
shotgun is slung across his shoulder, the caged fox strapped to
the saddle. A beat, then he puts away the binoculars and
gallops off along the path in the same direction as Damien, but
still way ahead of him.

appears from the bushes on foot -- CAMERA PANS him as he runs
to pick up the dead fox lying in f.g., then doubles back into
the bushes,

We now see that the path is on a slight embankment, and a
Gave~like bridge runs underneath it. Antonio dumps the dead
fox in the cave, picks up the cage containing the second fox,
and quickly crawls back up the embankment.

SHOOTING ALONG the woodland track: the lead Hounds round the
Dend in the track and race towards us. In f.g., Antonio lies
flat on his stomach behind the bushes, holding the caged fox.
A beat, then he releases the catch on the door, and the fox
tears out along the track, away from the approaching Hounds.

From Damien's P.O.V, as he rounds the corner: the fox is just
visible in the distance, racing away from him. From this angle
we see that there is a fork in the track branching off to the
left, but ignored by the Hounds.

Antonio crouches under the cave-like bridge, hurriedly tying a
length of string to the feet of the dead fox, while Damien
gallops overhead in pursuit of his new prey.

Antonio waits a moment, then scrambles clear of the bridge to
where his Herse is tethered.

Other Hounds are now racing along the track, but there is still
no sight of the rest of the Hunt. Antonio rides up from the
embankment, dragging the dead fox behind him and causing total
confusion among their ranks.

Antonio gallops the short distance back to the fork in the

tunnel of the aqueduct, carried across the valley by the
viaduct beyond.

EXT, VIADUCT - DAY 139

The fox tears along the viaduct, then bolts down the entrance
to its den (established in Scene 118) seconds ahead of the
Hounds. Damien rides up as the Hounds converge on the hole,
yapping after the fox, but unable to follow it underground.

SHOOTING FROM the viaduct approach (as in Scene 138): Damien
can be seen in EXTREME LONG SHOT at the far end of the viaduct
as he dismounts. A beat, then Antonio rides stealthily INTO
SHOT from behind CAMERA, approaching the viaduct with caution.
As he rides through the gate, he closes it behind him without
leaving the saddle.

EXT, VIADUCT ~ WESTERN ACCESS - DAY L40-A

LONG SHOT SHOOTING FROM the opposite (western) end of the
viaduct: Damien walks over to inspect the fox's hold,
surrounded by the Hounds, Beyond him, Antonio can be seen
riding slowly down the viaduct towards him, his approach
inaudible above the yapping Hounds. A second monk,
Brother Simeon, ENTERS SHOT in f.g. and walks out onto the
viaduct, closing the gate behind him.

SAME SCENE 140-3

SHOOTING UP FROM inside the entrance to the fox's den: Damien
peers almost INTO SHOT, surrounded by the lusting Hounds. A
pause, then Antonio appears beyond him on horseback. He takes
out a dagger from inside his coat, prepares to dismount.

WIDER ANGLE: Damien looks up to see Simeon moving towards him
from the western approach, his degger drawn. Simeon looks o.s,
prompting Damien to swing round in time to see Antonio about to
dismount. Without hesitation, Damien turns his eyes on
Antonio's horse: an icy, hypnotic gaze that sends the animal
into a frenzy, It rears up into the air, dispatching Antonio
from the saddle and hurling him over the wall of the viaduct.

EXT, VIADUCT AND RIVER - DAY 140-c

Antonio's body plunges over the viaduct, twisting in the air
as it plummets towards the jagged rocks of a river far below.

EXT, VIADUCT - DAY 140-D

Now Simeon advances on Damien, his way obstructed by the Hounds
still milling round the entrance to the fox's den. As he does
sc, Damien turns his eyes on the Hounds: the same icy gaze he
inflicted on Antonio's horse. For a brief moment the Hounds
yelp in aimless confusion -- as if scenting a new prey;
suddenly they turn on Simeon and like @ pack of crazed wolves,
hurling themselves at him and tearing him limb from spouting
limb.

Peter stands by a fish and chip stall, tucking into a bag of

Presently De Carlo emerges from the Mission, Peter picks up

De Carlo emerges from Hampstead Tube Station and hails a

Peter opens his satchel and takes out a pair of roller skates,
He straps them on his feet, then skates off down the steep

Peter moves closer as the door is opened by Barbara, holding
her baby. De Carlo talks to Barbara, but we cannot hear the
conversation -- only the look of concern on Barbara's face,
She ushers De Carlo into the house, closes the door behind him,

Why are you so fond of England?

DAMIEN

Oh, I don't know. I believe
that one's heart lies where one's
childhood lies, and as mine's
buried here, England's my Land
of Lost Content. I guess if my
father had been Ambassador to
Greenland, I'd have retraced his
footsteps there and now be living
in an igloo. I spent some of
the happiest days of my life here.

Damien and Kate lean over a broken fence by the edge of a small
weir. Damien points to the cascading water,

DAMIEN
He's under there somewhere,
lurking in the shadows ready
to pounce...Biggest pike you
ever saw -~ he must be at
least forty by now, We
first met when I was about
four; I was sitting on the
bank, dangling my feet in
the water, and Old Nick
introduced himself by jumping
up and biting through my big
toe, Wetve been on intimate
terms ever since.

KATE
You know that Old Nick's a name
for the devil in England?

DAMIEN
Sure I know. What else would
you christen one of God's
creatures who bites a little
boy's toe?

KATE
(matter-of-factly)
Do you believe in God?

Damien watches the water, looking for the pike.

DAMIEN
I think you know the answer
to that question,

Look ~~ there he goes...

Kate leans forward over the broken fence, searching the
tumbling water below.

KATE

DAMIEN
Down there --

From Damien's P.O.V., the dark shadow of a massive pike
looms beneath the surface of the water.

Kate leans further forward: suddenly the fence gives way
with a sharp crack, collapsing into the weir; Kate falls
with it, but manages to cling on to a stump with one hand.

A brief pause, an INTERCUT of expression: Kate helpless,
imploring; Damien impassive, watching, The moment is
reminiscent of “The Omen" when Damien's mother clung to the
balustrade before plunging to the floor.

Damien smiles. He kneels down, grips her wrist with both
hands and hauls her to safety.

In TIGHT TWO-SHOT, Kate gazes at Damien, trying to fathom
his mind. A long pause, then Damien helps her to her feet.

DAMIEN
Come on, let's get you some
dry clothes.

As they walk away in LONG SHOT, Kate tucks her arm around

Dean goes upstairs without waiting for a reply.
INT. DEAN'S HOME - STUDY - DUSK 181

Dean enters his study, reacting in stunned amazement to
the sight in front of him --

DEAN
What on earth...

Barbara is sitting in his chair, her baby boy in her arms.
The filing cabinet has been broken open, and the whole room
is strewn with papers. As Dean walks towards her, Barbara
clutches her baby tightly to her.

Barbara holds up a fistful of Xeroxed birth certificates.

BARBARA
A priest came by this afternoon

Damien Thorn's the Antichrist,
and he'll murder my baby just as
he's killed all the others born
the same day.

DEAN
You believe some religious
nutter who...

BARBARA
(interrupting)
No...I found the proof for

Suddenly Barbara breaks down, dropping the knife and appealing
to Dean's emotions.

BARBARA
For the love of God, Harvey...
you've got to help him destroy
Damien. He says you can do it...
Damien trusts you. Please,
Harvey -- get in contact with him.
For the love of God, Harvey --~-

Barbara clutches at Dean, weeping uncontrollably on his
shoulder. Dean says nothing: too shaken by his wife's
knowledge, too shaken by his own dormant fears.

Kate scoops out the ice, throws it in the fire.

DAMIEN
Never understood why you English
are so prejudiced against ice.

KATE

Damien smiles,

DAMIEN
I met a woman once who'd been
on the Titanic. She said she
Knew it was doomed before it
even set sail,

KATE
Then why did she go?

DAMIEN
Why does anyone tempt fate?
It's in man's nature, the urge
to challenge the gods to destroy
him,..before he destroys himself.

A pause. Kate fingers her glass in thought, then looks
Damien in the eye.

KATE
Who are you, Damien?
A pause,
DAMIEN
Shall I tell you now? Or
shall we have dinner first.

As they intensify, the Dog opens its eyes, slowly, begins
to pant.

Kate lies underneath Damien, gripping his hair, wildly

searching his eyes as he makes love to her in a conventional
fashion.

Suddenly he stops, pulls away from her as she verges on
the brink of orgasm.

KATE
No, Damien...don't stop!

Damien grits his teeth, shaking his head as if gripped by
some physical pain, some mental anguish.

KATE
What is it, Damien? Oh, Damien

Can't...
KATE

Damien pauses a moment, then suddenly grips her shoulder.

DAMIEN
You want to see what I see?

KATE
I want you.

Damien hesitates, then takes her by both shoulders and turns
her over on the bed, so that she is now lying face down. In
LOW ANGLE UP-SHOT, Damien mounts her from behind; as he
penetrates her, she cries out, gripping the bedposts with
both hands. The CAMERA REMAINS oblique THROUGHOUT the SCENE:
there are no explicit angles, no gratuitous indulgences.

The blazing fire of the previous night is now nothing but
a mound of embers, the room as silent as the grave.

A thin, cold light filters into the stillness. Kate lies
face down on the bed, naked, her arms hanging limp over
the end, her back bruised and scarred by fingernails.

Presently she stirs, opening her eyes to the memory of
the previous night. She glances about the room, but there
is no sign of Damien.

DOWN as she enters the room, HOLDING ON the f.g. figure of

naked in a fetal position like a sleeping dog. Kate approaches

in Scotland, Barbara's apparition is strictly in the eye of
the beholder.

Instead of screaming, Barbara utters a series of staccato
erles, as if in the grips of an epileptic fit. She backs
away from her Baby, whom we now see to be perfectly normal.
Barbara's hand involuntarily searches for a weapon.,.It

With a demonic shriek, Barbara lunges at him with the steam
iron, plunging the pointed end into his eye socket. Dean's
agonized scream is overlapped by the hissing iron as the
heated metal evaporates his eye in a belch of steam. The
force of Barbara's blow pins him against the wall, her body
masking his face. As she withdraws the iron, we catch a
glimpse of her victim: one side of Dean's face bears the
imprint of the lron's surface, “she lived skin dove-tailing
into the remnants of his eye socket. Dean's lifeless body
slithers to the floor, the shattered socket weeping matter
from the nether regions of his brain in a tear-like trickle
down his blistered cheek.

acknowledge Kate, who is standing behind them.

DAMIEN
Where is he?

KATE
Give me back my son, I will
lead you to him.

PETER
No, Damien -- I'm not her son...
I belong to you.

Damien pauses, then turns to Kate,
DAMIEN

Okay...lead us to the Nazarene
first, then you can have Peter

back,
PETER

No, Damien -- it's a trick.
DAMIEN

Not if she wants her son back

it isn't.

A pause.
KATE
(weakens )
All right.

Damien takes Peter by the hand, leads him to the door.

DAMIEN
Let's go.

As Kate turns to follow them, she looks up at the crucified
Christ.

KATE
{an anguished whisper)
If you can help me, help me
now.

A pause, then Kate turns and follows Damien and Peter from the
chapel.

EXT, FOUNTAINS ABBEY - NIGHT 202

FULL SHOT: Fountains Abbey, a vast, ruined cathedral,
silhouetted stark against the pre-dawn sky. The Abbey is
symbolic of the crumbling Christian faith, its windows gutted,
its roof a vaulted canopy of stars.

Presently the headlights of a car appear along the narrow
country lane leading to the Abbey.

The car turns into the field and pulls up a short distance
away from the deserted ruins.

Kate gets out of the car, followed by Damien and Peter, who
have ridden together in the backseat, Kate looks anxiously
about her, then turns to Damien:

KATE
Please, Damien,..let me go
on ahead,

DAMIEN

We all go together.

KATE
Trust me, Damien...I just
want to make sure that...

PETER
(interrupting)
No, don't trust her!

Damien grips tightly onto Peter's hand.

DAMIEN
(to Kate)
You lead the way.

Kate has little alternative out to lead Damien and Peter
towards the main entrance to the Abbey: a massive oak door,
with a smaller one set into it,

As Kate approaches, she glances furtively about the outcrops
of fallen masonry.

Kate reaches the main oak door and turns back to Damien.

KATE
In there.

DAMIEN
Open the door.

Kate turns the handle of the door. As she does so, she spots
De Carlo emerging from behind one of the fallen pillows.

KATE

(a ery)
No, Father,..!

Damien spins round to see De Carlo bearing down on him, dagger
upraised, Without a moment's hesitation, Damien grabs Peter
by the waist and holds him in the air like a human shield.

Too late to stop himself, De Carlo plunges the dagger into
Peter's back.

KATE
(screaming)
Peter!
His usefulness expended, Damien casts Peter aside, then grabs
at De Carlo, hurling him against the wall of the Abbey and
nolding him by the throat.
Eate rushes to Peter's side in near hysteria:
KATE
Oh, my darling...don't leave
me! Peter...don't die, don't...
Peter opens his eyes, as if in a dream,

PETER
(murmuring)
I love you...
(pause
Beyond life itseif, I love you,
Damien...

Kate grips at Peter as his eyes close with a smile:

KATE
No, Peter...no!

As if prompted by Peter's words, Kate's anguish suddenly turns
to revenge. She pulls out the dagger from Peter's back, turns,
and with one lightning strike, hurls herself at Damien,
plunging the dagger deep into his spine.

KATE
(screaming)
You bastard!
Damien utters a palpable moan -~- the grunt of a stricken beast

~- his hands letting go of De Carlo as he tries to grab hold
of the dagger in his back. But the blade is buried to thehils.
He turns to the door of the Abbey and staggers towards it.

INT, FOUNTAINS ABBEY - NIGHT 203

The door bursts open as Damien stumbles into the vastness of
the Abbey. For a moment he stands alone amid the towering
ruins, probing the darkness for his prey.

DAMIEN
Where are you, Nazarene? Come
out and face your destiny, as I
face minel

Silence.
DAMIEN
(louder)
Do you hear me, Nazarene?

As if in answer, the Christ Child Theme Fades gently in, the
shimmering, harmonic chord of tranquility.

DAMIEN'S P.O.V.: In EXTREME LONG SHOT, at the far end of the
Abbey, a light seems to glow in the darkness, a nebulous
source of energy.

REVERSE SHOT: In f,g. the glow forms a hazy circle of light,
a diffused halo circling the SCREEN, Through it, in LONG sHOT
we see Damien stagger towards it, his arms outstretched,
Suddenly he freezes, gripped in a spasm of pain and anguish,

LOW ANGLE: Damien lifts his face towards the night sky above
nin,

DAMIEN
(an agonized cry)
Sa-tan! Why hast thou deserted
me?

Damien's cry of desolation echoes through the Abbey ruins.
A pause, then he slumps to his knees:

DAMIEN
It's over, Father...
(face uplifted)
Receive me back into thy
paradise!

With a final convulsion, Damien falls forward, the dagger
wedged deep in his back. Beyond his prostrate form, the

nebulous source of light continues to glow at the far end
of the Abbey.

EXT, FOUNTAINS ABBEY - DAWN (SFX) 204

EXTENDED ZOOM, SHOOTING DOWN FROM the top of the Abbey. In
MEDIUM SHOT Kate kneels beside the body of her son, cradling
him in her arms, while De Carlo forms a sign of the Cross
over his forehead.

CAMERA PULLS SLOWLY BACK, the THREE SILENT FIGURES growing
smaller and smaller as the ZOOM RECEDES. As it does so, the
Abbey walls and windows begin to cast long shadows across the
field, as if the light source within the Abbey were growing
brighter. De Carlo and Kate look towards the Abbey, but
they are now too far away for us to see their reaction. As
the contrast between shadow and light grows stronger, so

does the Christ Child Theme, building in volume as the

CAMERA ZOOMS BACK TO its full extent.

CAMERA HOLDS IN EXTREME LONG SHOT as Kate lifts Peter in her
arms and slowly begins to walk with De Carlo towards the Abbey
doors.
END TITLES BEGIN AS Kate and De Carlo leave SHOT BELOW us,
CAMERA HOLDING ON the full shadow of the Abbey stretching
out across the fields and beyond.
it is probably the dawn.
