We move in, seeing that these are manuel workers,

There is no suggestion of slave-labour, they walk
haphezerdé, in ones and twos and bunches, as workers
everywhere, They exchange odd greetings as they
pass. What is unfemiliar to us is the high pre-

(as from their gard and gait they evidently are),
and among these the preponderance of young ones.

A GIRL, one of the workers, the last, emerging fron
the tunnel and approaching. At this distance we
can only guess at her age (about twenty) from her
careless, swinging walk, the easy carriage of 2
small pack over one shoulder. She looks very tiny,
approaching on her own.

EXTERIOR GRAVEYARD LOCATION DAY EARLY WINTER

HIGH-ANGLE LONG SHOT. Under a snow-heavy sky moved by a
strong wind is spread a flat landscape, fulland immense. In the
distance something winds towards us like an eel, across a vast pale
field of stubble. The CAMERA ZOOMS Slowly in. We begin to
recognise a procession, people in blacx, and hear above the wind a
requiem chant led by a choir. The ZOOM continues:

MEDIUM SHOT  Siill ZOOMING inwards we see that the procession
consists of some forty persons, mostly PEASANTRY of semi-Asiatic -
type, but a few MIDDLE-CLASS ladies and gentlemen, They are
following a coffin carried shoulder high, Immediately behind the coffin
walks 2 boy, dressed in black. This, in CLOSE SHOT is the thin-faced,
dark-eyed YURI, his features a refined version of the PRASANTS',

He is looking up at:

CLOSE SHOT TRACKING. The COFFIN. I is open, showing the
CORPSE OF A WOMAN surrounded by flowers. The waxen face has
the same exotic beauty as the boy's. .

CLOSE UP TRACKING. YURI. His eyes leave the coffin and look
gravely ahead. .

LONG SHOT. Angling past the shoulder of a sinuous semi-oriental
dome, we see the burial ground, its headstones, its high wall topped
with a running curve of ornament, its old carved gates hanging open,
the procession approaching. :

MEDIUM SHOT. (On SOUND the singing approaching) The HEAD-
STONES share the unfamiliar styling of the building Some are of
sheet iron and wag and rattle gently in the wind. Most are overgrown.

CLOSE SHOT. A HEADSTONE of heavy wood On it a photograph of
the deceased, a middle-aged man of quasi-asiatic type, with long
moustaches The singing louder.

CLOSE SHOT A sheet-iron headstone wags in the wind. On it.a
photograph of a child. Past this comes the PRIEST leading the coffin-
bearers and, YURI. The CAMEPA follows him in CLOSE UP. He

is looking about with a sort of wondering alertness at:

CLOSE TRACKING SHOT. THE HEADSTONES monstrous. On
one the PHOTOGRAPH of a WOMAN in her bridal gown.

CLOSE TRACKING SHOT. YURI. He looks upwards again
CLOSE TRACKING SHOT. The COFFIN looming above him.

CLOSE TRACKING SHOT. YURI. Looks downwards from the coffin.
Checks suddenly. The head of the procession has come to a halt.
Looks upwards as:

CLOSE SHOT. The PRIEST towers over him stretching out a hand.

CLOSE SHOT. YURI is gently propelled into a new position by the
Priest's hands Something above him catches his eye.

CLOSE SHOT. The COFFIN is being lowered from its high perch
against the sky. The CAMERA follows it downwards until the DEAD
WOMAN'S FACE comes to rest beside an open grave. —

CLOSE UP. YURI. We expect some reaction. But instead, the
Singing ceases and he looks round him with timid curiosity.

HIGH-ANGLE LONG SHOT. Looking down on the group around the
grave we see the MOURNERS and LOCALS shuffle round into a circle

of respectful radius, isolating YURI on one side of the grave, the
PRIEST on the other. The MOURNERS are well dressed, some dressed
elegantly and carry wreaths. Behind them are the LOCALS, roughly
clad, curious. Movement ceases except for the wind. Ali stare at
YURI.

CLOSE SHOT. ANNA and ALEXANDER GFROMEKO, with child TONYA
between them. ANNA a well-dressed middle-aged lady with a too
sensitive face. ALEXANDER, a dignified and gentle academic. They
regard YURI with deep sympathy.

MEDIUM SHOT. From their POV we see YURI and the PRIEST
who now commences:

PRIEST
The earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof, the
- @arth and everything that dwells therein.. etc.

CLOSE UP, TONYA, one hand in her mother's, peering shyly at:
CLOSE UP. YURI. He looks up with respectful curiosity.

CLOSE SHOT the PRIEST. From Yuri s low eye-line he looks
gigantic. He is reading from a small black book with professional
solernnity. His professional boredom is revealed in the way he sways
his weight from heel to toe, and adjusts his vestments as the wind
pulls atthem, He glances down his nose at:

CLOSE SHOT. YURI. He lowers his eyes, sees something and
cocks his head slightly.

CLOSE SHOT. His ‘MOTHER. . A YELLOW LEAF has blown onto
her face.

CLOSE SHOT. YURI. He.looks away at:

MEDIUM SHOT. A SILVER BIRCH is shedding its last yellow leaves
into the grey wind.

CLOSE SHOT. YURL The CAMERA TRACKS slowly towards him...

MEDIUM SHOT. THE TREE, from YURI'S POV, coming gradually
closer as the CAMERA ZOOMS slowly in. On SOUND the PRIEST's
official lamentation begins to dwindle, overlain by a "magical"
Singing, @ dirge for the tree as it parts with its leaves.

CLOSE UP. YURI. The CAMERA continues its track into BIG CLOSE
UP. The Priest's voice is by now entirely taken over by the DIRGE.
For a few moments YURI is lost inthe music. Then, with great .
suddenness, a harsh grating cuts off the DIRGE and YURI looks quickly -
his first and only moment of horror - at:

CLOSE SHOT The COFFIN LID is dragged into place by TWO SEXTONS,
obscuring his mother's face.

CLOSE UP. YURI watches, rivetted. The SOUND of the lid slipping
into place, a warning grunt followed by loud banging.

as it began Silence for a moment, and then a rising murmur of voices.
He looks round at:

MEDIUM SHOT, The LCCALS press forward, anxious not to miss the
next moment. The MOURNERS express shocked resentment, but they
too are fascinated.

CLOSE SHOT YURI. He looks down.
CLOSE SHOT The COFFIN is disappearing into the grave.

CLOSE SHOT. YURI steps forward to the very edge. He is frowning
with the effort to take in what is being done, but it could be taken for
morbid curiosity and:

CLOSE SHOT. ANNA. A little shocked, or daunted.

MEDIUM SHOT. Ropes are whipped up from the grave by four hefty
PEASANTS who have accomplished the job. The SEXTONS hasten
to shovel earth into it, one of them gently moves YURI back witha —
big hand, the better to perform his work.

»

CLOSE SHOT. The COFFIN lying in the grave, earth and pebbles
thundering and rattling on the wood, -

CLOSE UP. YURI. On SOUND the terrible drumming continues. The
CAMERA moves ints VERY BIG CLOSE UP. His face is clenched
with efforc, intellectual effort of enquiry, not emotional effort of
control. He is trying to come to terms with Death.

CLOSE UP. In grey light, faintly luminous, the perfected face of
YURI'S MOTHER, eyes closed, tranquil, is turned up to the shower of
thundering earth upon the coffin lid above her, as to a shower of gentle
Tain.

CLOSE SHOT. The GRAVE. Through a foreground of flying spades
we see that the coffin is almost covered.

BIG CLOSE UP. YURI has made his terms. He looks thoughtful but
not shocked, awed but upright, and is unaware of anything but what he
has just perceived. On SOUND the earth begins to fall softly on earth,
the CAMERA MOVES BACK and we hear the wailing of peasant women..
YURI hears jit, understands it has nothing for him, turns his head a
bit to see:

of a gentleman again succumb to the "magic'' dirge. The CAMERA
CRANES UPWARDS through the branches and flying leaves against
Processional clouds as YURI cannot possibly see them except in imagin-
ation, and then; SOUND modulating, we follow a shower of leaves out
of the moving cage of twigs to fly in freedora for a moment in grey
Space and: .

CLOSE UP. YURI MUSIC cuts. He is recalled to himself, looks
round startled. , :

MEDIUM SHOT. YURI in foreground. ANNA is beckoning him from
the head of the grave Evident: » She has said something to recall

him from what must have been a prolonged trance, for only she,
PRIEST, ALEXANDER and TONYA are mow present, and they are Iook-
ing at him curiously, The grave is piled with wreaths. The
MOURNERS are making their way with discreet relief along the path

to the monastery which abutts onto the graveyard. Lights are appearing
in the windows there,

YURI understands that they are waiting for him to place his small
nosegay. He walks forwardtodoso. He stops.

CLOSE SHOT. His small footsteps in the earth.
CLOSE UP, YURI. He looks up at the adults to see how bad this is.

CLOSE SHOT. ALEXANDER and ANNA. ANNA looks upset but
ALEXANDER gives him a faint enccuraging smile.

CLOSE SHOT. YURI places his nosegay among the wreaths ANNA
enters picture, takes his hand, smiling at him, perhaps a little
hesitantly, and leads him off into LONG SHOT where they join ALEX-
ANDER and TONYA. A little flurry of SNOW drifts across the picture.
ALEXANDER looks up at the sky. They follow the PRIEST down the
path to the monastery.

INTERIOR MONASTERY CELL STUDIO NIGHT

BIG CLOSE UP. TONYA, standing at the end of a bed, is staring
with great solemnity at: -

CLOSE UP. YURI sitting up in bed. A hand is held over his head and
the boy is looking seriously upwards at the owner:

CLOSE UP. The PRIEST, from YURI'S POV, his eyes shut and
lips moving in silent prayer. —

MEDIUM SHOT. They are ina little lamp-lit white-washed cell. -
The few articles of furniture are of plain white wood. There is a .
crucifix on the wall, A small domed trunk stands on the floor beneath
the window. His prayer concluded, the PRIEST makes the sign of

the Cross over the child, opens his eyes, and smiles down with
professional benevolence. YURI continues to examine him. The
PRIEST looks rather uncertainly at_.ANNA who looks uncertainly back
at him. The PRIEST clears his throat.

PRIEST a
You and your husband will dine with us Madame Gromeko,

ANNA
Thank you, Father.

The PRIEST goes, watched carefully by YURI. The watchfulness
of his keen little face hasn't altered, And ANNA is a little nervous
of him. . :

Will you lie down then, Yuri?

He looks at her and obediently lies back, still looking at her.
Nervously tucking him in she says:

Your mummy and I were great, great friends you know.
This very decent lady is excusing herself for taking to herself the
mother's part; but this dreadfully self-contained child continues
simply to look at her.

So now... we... are going to look after you,

YURI
Thank you.

With startling suddenness the child half rises, looking fiercely off
and saying very coldly:

That's Mother's.
ALEXANDER stands in the doorway, holding a fine balalaika, He
is stopped short by the child's intensity but comes and places the
instrument on the bed (the child sitting up to receive it) saying quietly:

ALEXANDER
It's yours, now.

YURI doesn't touch it but looks down at it. His tone is deadpan. ©

YURI
Mine?

ANNA
Yes. Mummy... left it to you.

YURI
In her will.

His face is still turned down from them, his tone expresses nothing
of whatever he is feeling, the phrase is dbviously from some adult
conversation he has overheard; he is probing for information. And
évidently there is some awkwardness in this region. The GROMEKOS
exchange a wary glance. ALEXANDER says gently and seriously,
inexpertly avuncular: .

ALEXANDER
Do you know what a Willis, old chap?

YURI
Money.

He looks straight up at them as he makes this unconscious indictment
of adult values. ANNA is a bit thrown.

ANNA
Well no, Yuri, just this. Your Daddy ... has all the money.

Looking down again his face hidden, he runs his fingers clumsily over
the strings. Brightly:

Can you play it?
He shakes his head.

ALEXANDER (Robust)
I thought all the people in this part of the world could play
the balalaika.

YURI (Looks at him, palely:)
You don't live here do you?

ANNA (Gently)

-No Yuri; we live in Moscow; that's a long way from here.
(Bright again:) But you'll like Moscow. (To her husband)
Wan't he? .

ALEXANDER (Quietly, looking at the boy)
After a bit. Takes time to get used to things, doesn't it
old man?

YURI looks at him. Then down at the instrument. But evidently
he has registered the gentle respect of ALEXANDER's tone, for he
vouchsafes:

YURI
Mother could play it.

He takes his hands from it, signalizing that he has finished with it.
ALEXANDER takes it, ANNA rises, saying seriously:

ANNA
Oh. Well, your mother was an Artist, Yuri: Your mother
had a Gift.

he is about to reach her the man in the gangway seat immediately behind
her rises, pushes past YUFI and goes. YUFI sinks gratefully into his

MEDIUM SHOT. LARA walking towards us through a poor district.
The CAMERA PANS with her as she turns a corner into a near-slum.
She is familiar with it and its people, the old and uncared-for, the
grim-looking young, the dirty cheerful children. A factory siren is
blowing at the end of the street towards which she is walking and
FACTOFY HANDS are beginning to pour into the street. They are
dirty and exhausted, poorly clad, heavy footed, they do not talk.

CLOSE SHOT. PASHA Antipov is distributing leaflets among them.
He is a tall young man of twenty-two with a bony face, thin lips, fine
eyes, pale, wearing spectacles, clad in a long threadbare coat and
shabby student's.cap. The FACTORY HANDS respect him. Those
who refuse his leaflets do so with a hurried shake of the head or are
shame-faced, those who accept them do so proudly or with a quick
hopeful glance at him from tired, resentful eyes. Suddenly a hefty
PLAIN-CLOTHES MAN and UNIFORMED POLICEMAN are on either
side of him. He does not flinch, was expecting it.

PLAIN-CLOTHES MAN

POLICEMAN is a brutal looking creature, PLAIN-CLOTHES MAN

coldly. He says primly: . .

PASHA
Very well.

He is ready to go, but on SOUND:

LARA (SOUND; sharp, alarmed)

Allturee turn, PLAIN-CLOTHES MAN looks at LAPA, a helpless.
put ‘nighly respectable figure. He rubs his chin, looks speculatively
back at PASHA, trying to connect them.

(Quickly) He's my brother.

PLAIN-CLOTHES MAN .
Well take him home then, miss. Before he gets into trouble.

 

PASHA and LARA go. PLAIN-CLOTHES MAN watches:

| of leaflets into his coat pocket.

209 CLOSE TRACKINGSHOT Following on the packs of LARA and
PASHA. PASHA draws a identical bundle of leaflets from his coat
pocket. Soberly, as they walk, he hands one to one of the oncoming
FACTORY HANDS. This river of faces flows past us during:

He hands another. LAP.A is a bit inawe of him. Protesting, but
timidly:

LARA oe
Pasha, why has it got to be done?

PASHA
For them. For the Revolution.

CLOSE TPACKING SHOT REVERSE on LARA and PASHA, the river
of approaching faces now a river of receding weary backs. FACTORY
HAND gets a leaflet, hears the phrase, looks back alarmed.

LARA .
Pasha, they don't want the revolution.

PASHA
Yes they do. They don't know it yet, but that’s what they
want. .

A serious-looking FACTORY HAND runs up, much older than PASHA
but addresses him as an equal: .

FACTORY HAND
Give me some of those, Comrade.

Without a word PASHA gives him half the leaflets. He falls back and
we see him busy distributing as the CAMERA PANS with LAFA and
PASHA who turn into 2 quieter street, still of the same character but
without the FACTORY HANDS.

CLOSE TRACKING SHOT. PASHA and LARA. She looks quickly to
see they are not overheard, and very quietly:

LARA
Pasha, are you a - Bolshevik?

PASHA .
No. The Bolsheviks don't like me. And I don’t like them.

LARA
What else could I tell him?

deserts him altogether) - fiance. ,

_She withdraws her arm, delicately. Says pleadingly:

unhappily at his feet. LARA looks round muttering:

LARA
People... gossip... round here.

PASHA (Earnestly)
’ It's the system Lara. People will be different after the

She gives him a shy smile of gratitude, and purely out of gratitude,
takes a leaflet. He lights up: :

applause and silly laughter. The CAMERA TRACKS slowly as

KOMAROVSKY's particular tastes, in a very Sophisticated brightly

have seen him do before. LARA grows still. KOMAROVSKY
leads her back to the chair and seats her. She holds on to his hand
looking wildly up to him. Awkwardly he soothes her and disengages
his hand. He backs away taking the lamp with him.

CLOSE SHOT. The glass panelled door is opened by KOMAROVSKY.
MEDICAL PROFESSOR and YURI come out. KOMAROVSKY
addresses them with the decent brevity of one who knows words to be
inadequate. Gruffly:

KOMAROVSKY

Well gentlemen, I won't attempt to express my gratitude.
For the rest... (A-stoic little shrug) & am in your hands.

MEDICAL PROFESSOR (Frowning, awkward:)
Forget it, Victor. :

KOMAROVSKY (As one who, though unwilling, must say
ft out:) Does that apply to you ‘both?

He is looking at YURI. YURI locks packathim. They both know
what he means. :

MEDICAL PROFESSOR (Softly, slightly shocked)
Not a question to ask, Victor.

KOMAROVSKY (As one willingly accepting deserved
correction) Forgive me.

In manly fashion he shakes hands with MEDICAL PROFESSOR.
Would shake hands with YURI but:

MEDICAL PROFESSOR
Cheer up Yuri; I'll have the poor bitch in hospital tonight.

YURI
What's his name?

MEDICAL PROFESSCR (A bit startled by the tone)
Mp? That's V.I. Komarovsky. ‘Says he knows you.

YURI
Oh. He executed my father’s Will.

MEDICAL PROFESSCR
You've dealt with him?

No. 1 didn't feel competent to deal with him; I was
eight years old. Uncle Alex turned it down.

MEDICAL PROFESSOR
Oh. (He is curious but too well bred to question)

YURI :
By Komarovsky's account there wasn't much in it. And
what there was belonged to Komarovsky.

MEDICAL PROFESSOR : :

Oh he’s a very good business man. (Deprecating) But
I doubt if he's crooked. Very good company. Knows

oil-cloth covered tables, iron pillars and 2 lot of steamed-up icy
windows. A few mid-afternoon customers retain their overcoats.
A WAITER enters picture carrying two bowls of steaming heavy-
looking soup with iron spoons. CAMERA PANS with him into a
CLOSE SHOT of LARA and KOMAROVSKY, sitting on opposite sides
of atable. He is the only person over thirty in the place and looks
incongruous and forlorn. Events have unmanned him; he is sad
and tired, for the moment anyway defeated. LARA regards him

anxiously, a bit remorsefully. They speak quietly, the mood
elegiac, all passion spent.

LARA
You don't mind coming here, do you Victor Yppolitovich?

KOMAROVSKY (Quickly)
No, no... reminds me of my youth... (A pause)

LARA -
I went to the hospital again.

KOMAROVSKY (Looks up quickly)
And -?

LARA
She wants you to go and forgive her ... (KOMAROVSKY
looks at her) For her suspicions. .

KOMAROVSKY (Grimaces distastefully. Quietly)
You can tell her the truth if you like, Larissa.

LARA (Quickly)
No.

KOMAROVSKY
Well I don't see much point - It's over and done with.

LARA
Will you - (Hesitates) - see Mother now?

KOMAROVSKY (Smiles at her tact and helps her out)
Aslusedto? No... (Softly, wryly reflective) In fact
I should not be surprised if you were my Swan Song.

LARA (Cont)

KOMAROVSKY rises and shakes hands with PASHA. Both sit again.
PASHA takes his spectacles off looking pedantic, tense, severe. His
faded scar gives his already impressive face an added consequence.
A moment's awkwardness, dealt with by the older man.

KOMAROVSKY
Will you eat?

PASEA
No thank you.

He moves his spectacles pedantically in his fingers, looking at
KOMAROVSKY in steady silence. LARA's eyes go from one to the
other, anxious for it to go well.

KOMAROVSEKY .
T hope you don't think this impertinent, Pavel Pavlovich.

PASHA
Not at all.

CLOSE UP KOMAROVSKY

KOMAROVSKY
Iam -1I have advised Larissa's mother for many years.
I'm interested in what happens to her ...

DISSOLVE

MEDIUM SHOT. The bowis are empty, PASHA is braced back in

his chair, points of colour in his cheeks, his eyes excited, speaking
quickly. KOMAROVSKY is listening gravely. LARA looks earnestly
from one to the other.

PASHA

..- something that I ought to tell you M’sieur Komarovsky.
And that is this: 1am committed to the Revolution.

Nothing - (Puts a hand on LARA's hand; KOMAROVSKY
registers it) not even Lara - has more importance for. me.

to show that she agrees, and KOMAROVSKY shifts uneasily)

KOMAROVSKY (Raises his head; rather sternly:) .
You misunderstand. It's not your political views that
concern me. So far as that goes Tam more in sympathy -
than you probably suppose. Ihave some contacts of my
own which might surprise you. (PASHA looks at him
_ sceptically. Curtly:) How do you propose to live?

PASHA
I've been offered a teaching post.

KOMAROVSEY
May I know where?

PASHA
Gradov. It's in the Urals.

KOMAROVSKY
I know it. Not much of a place.

It's lovely country, M'sieur Komarovsky.. (Unconsciously
she has slipped into PASHA's style of address)

KOMAROVSKY (Ignores her; to PASHA)
It will be a very quiet life, won't it?

LARA
But that's what we want. (Winningly, charmingly,
begging KOMAROVSEY to share the rustic dream)

KOMAROVSKY
Mm. (To PASHA) Will - you must excuse me - will
. your salary be adequate.

PASHA
Adequate. Not more.

KOMAROVSKY sees LARA looking adoringly at PASHA. His
jealousy is now roused. Unctuously, with a mock-compassionate,
very insulting smile:

KOMAROVSKY ‘
Pavel Pavlovich, my chief impression -I hope you won't .«
be offended - is that you're very young.

PASHA (Flushes, collects himself and comes back harder
than KOMAROVSKY had prepared for; looking clearly at

PASHA (Cont). , .
' (the older man) M'sieur Komarovsky - L hope you won't be
offended: Do people improve with age?

The challenge is out on either side. In the conflict, KOMAROVSKY
will have the guile of age and its lack of conviction, PASHA the
directness of youth and its lack of control. KOMAROVSKY, after
a moment's inward shock, smoothly, mock-detached.

KOMAROVSKY
They grow more tolerant.

PASHA (Instantly)

Because they have more to tolerate in themselves. If
people don't marry young, what do they bring to their
marriage?

KOMAROVSKY (More and more deliberately patronising)
A little experience.

PASHA
Tam twenty-six -..

KOMAROVSKY (Murmurs)
You surprise me.

PASHA (Flushes again, repeats)

I am twenty-six. My mother died, needlessly, when I
was eight. My father died in prison. I have fended for
myself. I have worked my way through Higher School
and University. 1 am familiar with things that you can
hardly guess at.
KOMAROVSKY .

All this is experience of a kind certainly -

PASHA (Jumping in)

I have had no "amorous" experience. If that is what you
mean. (KOMAROVSKY blinks. That is what he meant
but he hadn't expected to have it said openly, and PASHA
underlines it) None whatever. Lara is seventeen; that
speaks for itself. (And again he puts his hand on hers to
say:) You probably find this situation comic. We don't.
We're going to be married, next year.

In dead silence he rises. KOMAROVSKY, inwardly enraged,
controls himself perfectly. LARA is scarlet. PASHA triumphant,

CLOSE SHOT. LARA and KOMAROVSKY.

KOMAROVSKY
A young Crusader.

LARA

KOMAROVSKY
He's a very fine young man; that's obvious.

LARA (Almost apologizing)

passes CAMERA, followed by KOMARCVSKY, on her way down the
passage to the glass panciled door.

LONG SHOT. The door opens and LARA lets KOMAROVSKY go

ahead of her into the fitting room. The place is deserted. Every-
thing covered in dust-sheets. In AMELIA's absence the business

has wound down. When the door shuts their isolation is merely under-
lined by the distant noises of the afternoon. The windows are darken-
ing towards evening. LARA looks about the desolate silent scene and
shivers KOMAROVSKY is walking away from her, slowly but
restless

LARA (A little ill at ease)
M'sieur Komarovsky will you...

KOMAROVSKY (Stops)

I beg you, drop this affectation of addressing me as
"M'sieur Komarovsky”. (With dreadful emphasis,

turning) Under the circumstances, it's rather ridiculous.
(LARA is aghast) Lara, | am determined to save you from
a dreadful error. There are two kinds of men; and only
two. That young man is one kind. He is "Bighminded".
He is "Pure". He is the kind of man the world pretends
to look up to and in fact despises. What is more, he is the
kind of man who breeds unhappiness. Particularly in
women. Do you understand?

LARA (Angry, eyes flashing)
No

KOMAROVSKY
I think you do. There is another kind of man. Not high-

‘minded. Not pure. But alive... (This flattering assess-

ment of himself is made with some passion) Now, that your
tastes at this moment should incline towards the juvenile, is
understandable. But for you to marry that boy is pure
disaster. Because - (She covers her ears, he pulls her
hands away) Because, there are two kinds of women ....
(He lets it sink in) and you, as - we - well - know, are not
the first kind ....

Her eyes fill; she.thinks it is true. Then she hitshim. His eyes

shine.

Gently:
You, my child, are a slut.

LARA (Passionate, despairing)
Tam not!

KOMAROVSKY
Let's see.

He lunges at her wrapping her in his arms. A shockingly elemental
struggle begins as, fighting wildly, she is borne across the room.

becomes quite still. .

goes leaving the reflection of LARA.

KOMAROVSKY . .
And don't delude yourself that this was rape. ‘That
would flatter us both. ‘

CLOSE SHOT. The heap of clothing stirs. LARA sits up. Her
face is tear-stained but her eyes are dry and fierce with the
unconscious ferocity of a lioness - not forcedly fierce like a huraan
being.

SVENTYTSKIS' bedroom. YURI doctors KOMAROVSKY's hand,
while host and hostess listen. It seems that fright has chastened
him again: ‘

-KOMAROVSKY (Quiet, a bit shaky)

The girl bears me a grudge. To be honest, not without
grounds. She is a political enthusiast. I was instru-
mental in the prosecution of her brother. He got the
maximum sentence. Some of the evidence entered by
the Police was - questionable. I doubt if she's right

MEDIUM SHOT. TONYA, in some embarrassment, draws YURI
into the hall to confront them. He is uncomprehending of the
situation but ready to accept it, at his most polite and willing.
The middle-class routine of introduction is both pleasant and
bizarre - pleasant in them, bizarre because it is one-sided.

TONYA
Yuri; this is Comrade Yelkin (She makes a title of
"Comrade" as "Major Yelkin" our local Delegate, he

lives here.

YURI (Shaking hands)
Oh, Welcome.

TONYA (Introducing JANITOR)

CLOSE SHOT. TONYA is in the kitchen. Harassed, hair awry,

EXTERIOR MOSCOW STREET LOCATION NIGHT
WINTER - SNOW

CLOSE SHOT. Night. With a shriek of rusting nails and
agonised groaning of timber, YURI wrenches ‘wood from a fence.
He works furiously, violently, a black figure silhouetted against
the snow and mist. He gives a glance around before attacking
the fence again. No-one is about, it seems. CAMERA PANS to
the other side of the street, behind him. In MEDIUM SHOT we
see a motionless ghostlike figure, watching. CAMERA begins
tracking towards it. On SOUND:

YEVGRAF (SOUND) :

I told myself it was beneath my dignity to arrest a man
for pilfering firewood. But nothing ordered by the Party
is beneath the dignity of any man. And the Party was
right. One man desperate for a bit of fuel is pathetic,
five million people desperate for fuel will destroy a city.

CAMERA comes to rest on CLOSE SHOT of YEVGRAF. He is
dressed in a semi-uniform of leather coat, knee boots, pistol.

MEDIUM SHOT. POV YEVGRAF. On the other side of the
street YURI is collecting the wood and wrapping it ‘within his coat.

CLOSE UP. YEVGRAF. On SOUND he continues to speak in the
past tense, remembering the experience we are witnessing.

Nor was it admiration; for a better man than me. I
did admire him, but I didn't think he was a better man.

back as he approaches the Gromekos’ street.

I admired him for his poetry, and poetry I admired as I

a fire has been lit and its smoke ascends to the high domed ceiling.
Round it stand SAILORS, herculean figures, a conscious elite,
well-equipped, standing well or sprawled among their kit; the fire

frightened; and like most frightened men he looks dangerous.
Very carefully: .

I'm sure she will vouch for me, if she's with you.

PASHA's face goes stiff with pain for just one second, then he
relinquishes the knife and with surprising clumsiness, distastefully
shoves knife, fork, spoon across the table. YURI takes then,
understanding that this means acquittal but waiting for the explanation.

says indignantly: .

WOMAN
You say you're Reds, but how do I know?

And could you have the Party taken out and shot?

its close, the political struggle intensifies. In the hour
of victory the military will have served its purpose.
All men will then be judged politically - regardless of
their military record.

YURI who looks back at her, serious and alert. KOMAROVSKY appeal
in the doorway. Slices of sleet slide from his coat as he regards them
both, rather pleased by the effect he has created. The suspicion
crosses our minds that he is not perfectly steady on his feet. But his
firm, insolently commanding voice, quite quiet, reassures us.
KOMAROVSKY :
Yuri Andreyevich, you've changed I think. Oh yes,
decidedly. Larissa Antipova... (A fatherly smile)...

May I come in?

You served two years with the Partisans. Fifth Division;
Commander Gregory Liberius; Political Commissar

writings, are flagrantly subversive. Your days are
numbered. Unless Ihelp you. Do you want my help?

He takes out a cigar, a poor thing, but still, a cigar. YURI is
considerably shaken, LARA appalled; but the set distaste on
YURI's face remains.

KOMAROVSEY has a moment of surprise, incipient anger, even
alarm but is reassured by LARA's laying her hand on YURI

YURI looks after her as she goes into the kitchen. He is recalled by:

KOMAROVSKY :

Please don't underestimate me. Either practically - or

morally. Iam not the man you take me for. —

LARA returns, puts three glasses before KOMAROVSKY, sits at the
far end of the table - but still quite close to KOMAROVSKY - asks,

quickly and quietly:
How d’you know all this about Yuri? How can you help? |

LARA raises her glass, finds KOMAROVSKY smiling ather. He
tosses off his drink, she lowers hers without drinking, her face
clouded. YURI has seen this, understanding some reference has
been made from which he is excluded.

go... Wherever you like ... to Paris ... or (delicately)

He has trodden with his unctuous delicacy slap into YURI's Holy of
Holies - an already inflamed area. YURI looks at him with tormented

eyes.

YURI

KOMAROVSKY glares at him. He tosses back his fourth glass. He

says quite quietly but with great intensity, shakily putting down his

glass: - .

too heavy to shift. Thus in the centre of the hallway stands a marble

two others and again considers. He looks more like an engineer than

She is still smiling and YURI smiling with her. He is inclined to join
in the elaboration of the wish dream. But he receives an apprehension
of what they are at. His smile goes:

YURI
I think we may go mad, if we think about - all that.

LARA (Her smile persists)
I shall always think about it. (He looks at her; she looks
at the poems)... Will you write today?

Spare me your expressions of regret. He was a murder-

they watched her in Yuriatin? They were waiting for
Strelnikov. :

- YURI (Looking at him, wary. but beginning to breathe
hard) If they thought that Strelnikov would run to his
wife - they didn't know him.

KOMAROVSKY

They knew him very well. He was five miles from here
when they caught him. (YURI stares, appalled.
KOMAROVSKY calmly presses his advantage:) I'll tell
you the manner of it. He was arrested on the open road,
He didn't conceal who he was. Indeed throughout the
interview he insisted that they call him "Pavel Antipov” -
which is his right name ~ and refused to answer to the
name of Strelnikov. On his way to execution he took a
pistol from one of the guards and blew his own brains out.

YURI .
Oh my God... (His gaze wonders, suddenly flashes in
alarm:) Don't tell Lara this.

KOMAROVSEY

I know Lara at least as well as youdo... This neurotic
gesture at the eleventh hour is just the sort of thing that
would unbalance her. But you see her position. She's
served her purpose. Those men who came with me to-day
as an escort, will come for her and the child to-morrow,
as a firing squad.

KOMAROVSKY drinks in YURI’s helplessness. The venemous resent-
ment of what follows is the more frightening because it must be kept lov

Now. I know exactly what you think of me. And why...

So are you coming with me? Do youaccept the protection
