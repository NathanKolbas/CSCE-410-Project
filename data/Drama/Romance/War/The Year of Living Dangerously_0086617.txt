EXT. AIRPORT, JAKARTA - NIGHT (CREDIT SEQUENCE)

The stucco terminal building is grimy and run down.
Soldiers in battle dress with sud-machine guns are
posted by its doors, and stand in groups abour the
tarzac. On the edges of the field anti-aircraft: gims
point at the sky. The soldiers stare in the direction
of a KLM 707 which has just laced.

At the foot of the gangway, two more soldiers with
sten gums watch the passengers as they descenc the
steps, and the Europeans blink back at them with
some uneasiness. The fainc menacing tempo of
Indonesian gamelan music drifts through the heavy
night air.

GUY HAMILTON moves down the gangway, a tape recorder
slung over his shoulder. Unlike most oz his fellow
passengers he is clearly not intimidated by the guards.
Most of the passengers head for the tramsit locnge,
only HAMILTON and two or three INDONESTANS move towards
Passport Control.
