SCREENPLAY BY: ANTHONY MINGHELLA
EXT. THE SAHARA DESERT. LATE 1942

SILENCE. THE DESERT seen from the air. An ocean of dunes for
mile after mile. The late sun turns the sand every colour from
crimson to black and makes the dunes look like bodies pressed
against each other.

An old AEROPLANE is flying over the Sahara. Its shadow swims
over the contours of sand.

A woman's voice begins to sing - Szerelem, szerelem, she cries,
in a haunting lament for her loved one.

INSIDE the aeroplane are two figures. One, A WOMAN, seems to be
asleep. Her pale head rests against the side of the cockpit.
Behind her THE PILOT, a man, wears goggles and a leather
helmet. He is singing, too, but we can’t hear him or the plane
or anything save the singer’s plaintive voice.

The plane shudders over a ridge. Beneath it A SUDDEN CLUSTER OF
MEN AND MACHINES, camouflage nets draped over the sprawl of
gasoline tanks and armoured vehicles. An OFFICER, GERMAN,
focusses his field glasses. The glasses pick out the MARKINGS
on the plane. They are in English. An ANTI-AIRCRAFT GUN swivels
furiously.

Shocking bursts of GUNFIRE. Explosions rock the plane, which
lurches violently. The fuel tank is punctured. It sprays out
gasoline, then erupts in flame engulfing both figures in a
fireball.

INT. TRAIN. ITALY 1944. BEFORE DAWN

AN ALLIED HOSPITAL TRAIN ploughs through the night carrying
MILITARY WOUNDED back to Naples.

A young French-Canadian nurse, Hana, walks through a long
carriage past rows of the injured. She stops at the bunk of A
WOUNDED SOLDIER. Hana bends to the boy. He’s had shrapnel in
his legs and cheek. She speaks softly to him.

BANA
How are you?

BOY
Okay.

HANA

Your leg will be fine. A lot
of shrapnel came out - I saved
you the pieces.

BOY
You‘re the prettiest girl
I've ever seen.
CONTINUED

HANA
(she hears this every
day)
I don’t think so.
BOY
Would you kiss me?
HANA
No, I‘1l get you some tea.
BOY
(innocent)
It would mean such a lot to
me.
HANA
{tender, believing
him)
Would it?

She kisses him, very softly, on the lips.

BOY
Thank you.

He closes his eyes. Hana smiles, continues along the
compartment. TEASING VOICES CALL OUT after her.

#1 INJURED MAN
Nurse - I can‘t sleep.

#2 INJURED MAN
Would you kiss me?

#3 INJURED MAN
You’re so pretty!

HANA
(good-naturedly waving
away their joke)

Very funny. Go to sleep now.

She opens the door of the next carriage and walks straight into
the carnage left by an emergency operation. MARY, another
nurse, is removing a blood-soaked bundle from the operating
table. Mary grimaces.

MARY
Don’t ask.

EXT. THE DESERT. DAY
THE PILOT HAS BEEN RESCUED BY BEDOUIN TRIBESMEN. Behind them

the wreckage of the plane, still smoking, the Arabs picking
over it. A SILVER THIMBLE glints in the sun, is retrieved.
Another man comes across A LARGE LEATHER-BOUND BOOK and takes
it over to where the Pilot is being tended to. The Book is full
of letters and cards and paintings. They’re scattering
everywhere. The Pilot is terribly burned, barely alive, his
face charred. One of the Bedouins covers his face with a
makeshift mask made from plaited palm leaves.

EXT. THE DESERT. DUSK

The Pilot is being carried across the desert. The mask covers
his face. His view of the world is through the slats of palm. He
glimpses camels, fierce low sun, the men who carry him.

EXT. EMERGENCY FIELD HOSPITAL, 1944. LATE DAY

The EMERGENCY FIELD HOSPITAL is a cluster of tents practically
ahead of the Front Line. SPORADIC GUNFIRE, increasingly near,
sounds throughout. It’s 1944 and the war in Italy is still
intense.

INT. MAIN TRIAGE TENT. EMERGENCY FIELD HOSPITAL. NIGHT

Hana and her best friend, JAN, walk through the main TRIAGE
TENT. It’s packed with the ruined bodies of the injured,
swaddied in bloody bandages.

INT. TRIAGE TENT, EMERGENCY FIELD HOSPITAL. EVENING

HANA IS GIVING BLOOD. She lies in a cot, next to JAN. The
shelling sounds closer.

Behind a curtain, OLIVER, a Doctor, is working on the most
recent patient, a young CANADIAN SOLDIER who is critically ill
- the tubes hanging above him, of plasma and of blood, his
stomach a bloody mess. The curtain drawn around him is pulled
back to reveal the two nurses in background. The Soldier can
just see them. He’s going to die any minute.

CANADIAN SOLDIER
(whispering to Oliver)
Is there anybody from Picton?

OLIVER
Picton? I don’t know.

CANADIAN SOLDIER
I'd like to see somebody from
home before I go.

Hana can only really hear Oliver’s end of this conversation,
but the mention of Picton chills her, and she knows, now, not
later, that her lover is dead.

HANA
(to Oliver)
Why Picton?

 
CONTINUED

OLIVER
He's from there - edge of Lake
Ontario, right, Soldier?

The boy nods.

JAN
(innocent)
Hey, that’s where your
sweetie’s from? Somewhere
near there, isn't it?

HANA
(to Oliver)
Ask him what company he’s
with?

Oliver leans over, then turns to Hana.

OLIVER
Third Canadian Fusiliers.

HANA
Does he know a Captain
McGann?
The boy hears this, whispers to Oliver.
CANADIAN SOLDIER
He bought it. Yesterday. Shot
to bits.
The shells are getting closer.

HANA
What did he say?

OLIVER
(can't look at her)
Doesn't know him.

A SHELL suddenly lands on top of the site, perhaps fifty yards
from the tent. THE LIGHTS GO OUT. Then ANOTHER lands.

Everybody is on the floor, struggling to get on a helmet.

Hana lies down, the blood still leaving her, her helmet on.
Oliver is next to her in the mud. Her heart is breaking.

HANA
He’s gone, he’s gone, he's
gone.

OLIVER

No. He’s = no.
CONTINUED

HANA
Oh God. Oh God.

The shells pound them, incredibly loud, drowning out her grief,
but each explosion illuminates it for a moment.

EXT. AN OASIS. NIGHT.
The SOUND OF GLASS, of tiny chimes. A music of glass.

AN ARAB HEAD floats in darkness, shimmering from the light of a
fire. The image develops to reveal a man carrying a large
wooden yoke from which hang DOZENS OF SMALL GLASS BOTTLES, on
different lengths of string and wire. He could be an angel.

The man approaches the litter which carries The Pilot. He’s
still in the protective palm mask, wrapped in blankets. The
MERCHANT DOCTOR stands over the burned body and sinks sticks
either side of him deep into the sand, then moves away, free of
the yoke, which balances in the support of the two crutches.
Then he slowly sets about peeling away the layers of oiled
cloth which protect the Pilot’s flesh.

The Merchant Doctor crouches in front of the curtain of
bottles, then leans back to pluck, hardly looking, certain
bottles which he uncorks and mixes. He uses this green-black
paste to anoint the burned skin. All the while he is humming
and chanting. The bottles continue to jingle.

EXT. BEACH FRONT, ITALY. LATE 1944. DAY
Wounded Soldiers walk with nurses along the beach
EXT. BEACH CABINS, ITALY. LATE 1944. DAY

THIS CONVALESCENCE HOSPITAL HAS BEEN FASHIONED FROM A LONG ROW
OF BATHING CABINS ON THE COAST, complete with Campari Umbrellas
and metal tables, at which are seated the bandaged and the
dying and the comatose, staring out to sea or in slow, muted
conversation. A BRITISH OFFICER makes notes. He is talking to a
wounded PATIENT, whom we recognize as the burned Pilot.

OFFICER (0/S)
Name? Rank? Serial number?

THE PATIENT (0/S)
No. Sorry. I think I was a
pilot. I was found near the
wreckage of a plane at the
beginning of the war.

Hana walks up to The Patient's cabin. He is propped up with a
view of the sea, which is interrupted by the British Officer.
Hana has a blanket and a chart for The Patient‘s bed. She
busies herself.
CONTINUED

OFFICER
Can you remember where you
were born?

THE PATIENT
Am I being interrogated? You
should be trying to trick me.
Or make me speak German,
which I can, by the way.

OFFICER
Why? Are you German?

THE PATIENT
No.

OFFICER

How do you know you’re not
German if you don’t remember
anything?

THE PATIENT
Might I have a sip of water?

Hana pours hima glass of water. He notices her.

THE PATIENT
Thank you.
(he sips)
I remember lots of things. I
remember a garden, plunging
down to the sea - nothing
between you and France.

OFFICER
This was your garden?

THE PATIENT
Or my wife's.

OFFICER
Then you were married?

THE PATIENT

I think so. Although I
believe that to be true of a
number of Germans. Look -

(makes a small gap

with his fingers)
I have this much lung...the
rest of my organs are packing
up - what could it possibly
matter if I were Tutankhamen?
I’m a bit of toast, my friend
- butter me and slip a poached
egg on top.
EXT. ITALIAN HILL ROAD. DAY

A CONVOY OF TWENTY TRUCKS - Red Cross vehicles and some supply
vehicles - snakes along a bumpy hill road. The war in Italy is
largely over and the Allies are moving up the country, the
wounded and supply lines slowly following.

EXT. ITALIAN HILL ROAD. DAY

A JEEP pulls out of the line and approaches the Red Cross truck
containing Hana and The Patient. The horn blows and Hana looks
out to see it contains her friend JAN. TWO YOUNG SOLDIERS sit
up front, one driving, both grinning. Jan signals for Hana’s
attention.

JAN

Hana! Hana! Hana! There’s
meant to be lace in the next
village - the boys are going
to take me.

(mischievously)
You don’t have any money, do
you? Just in case there’s
silk.

HANA
No!

JAN
Hana, I know you do. Come on.
Oh, come on.
(to the soldiers)
She's a softy, she loves me.

Hana leans under the tarpaulin, holding some DOLLARS. The two
hands - hers and Jan’s - reach for each other as the vehicles
bump along side by side. They laugh at the effort. Jan‘s GOLD
BRACELET catches the sun and glints.

JAN
(getting the money)
I love you.

The Jeep accelerates away. Hana sighs to the Patient.

Suddenly AN EXPLOSION shatters the calm as the jeep runs over a
MINE. The jeep is THROWN into the air. The convoy halts and
there's chaos as soldiers run back pulling people out of the
vehicles. Hana runs the other way, toward the accident, until
she is prevented from reaching Jan’s mangled body by the
consoling arms of Oliver.

EXT. ITALIAN HILL ROAD. LATER

- and there’s still chaos as two SAPPERS (Bomb Disposal Squad)
work on the road ahead. One of them, a SIKH, wears a turban.
EXT. ITALIAN HILL ROAD. DAY

KIP, the Sikh lieutenant, and HARDY, his sergeant, explore the
road ahead of the becalmed convoy, using saucer-like METAL
DETECTORS and HEADSETS. Kip is young, lithe, contained, utterly
focused as they inch along the debris-strewn road. He stiffens
as he registers metal. With a bayonet he carefully scrapes at
the mud-caked surface. Something GLEAMS. Suddenly, A PAIR OF
FEET walk across his vision as HANA HURRIES PAST, walking
carelessly up the road. It’s so surreal that neither man
registers at first, and then Kip is shouting.

KIP
Hey! Hey! Stop! Hey!

Now Hardy is shouting for her to stop. Hana looks around.

HARDY
Don’t move, Stand ABSOLUTELY
STILL!

Hana stops. Hardy gingerly follows her footsteps.

HARDY
(as he approaches)
Good, that’s good, just stay
still for me and then we'll be
fine.

He arrives at Hana. Then grabs her. He'd like to slap her face.

HARDY
What are you doing? What the
bloody heli do you think
you’re doing?

By way of answer she looks at the ground ahead of her feet.
Jan’s BRACELET lies in the mud. Hardy bends down and collects
the mangled bracelet, presses it into Hana’s hands.

EXT. VILLAGE. DUSK

The CONVOY is threading through A RUINED VILLAGE, passing the
souvenirs of war: an overturned vehicle now used as a game by
some children, dejected refugees tramping along the side of the
road.

INT. RED CROSS TRUCK. CONTINUOUS
Hana sees all this as she sits blankly inside the truck, the

Patient swaying alongside her. She puts out her hand to steady
him. Tears streak her face.
EXT. CONVOY SITE, ITALY. DUSK

THE CONVOY is making a PIT STOP. The trucks are silhouetted in
a line. Hana helps lift The Patient’s stretcher onto the
ground. She bends to him. Hana gets up to prepare a MORPHINE
INJECTION from a small kit. Mary arrives. Touches Hana gently,
conscious of her grief for Jan‘s death.

MARY
Are you okay? Oh god, Hana,
you and Jan were inseparable.

HANA
(sighs angrily)
We keep moving him - in and
out of the truck. Why? He’s
dying. What's the point?

MARY
(thrown )
Do you mean leave him? We
can’t. We can hardly leave
him.

Hana has settled down beside The Patient's stretcher. She draws
herself up against the night. On the hill above, she can see
the outline of A SMALL MONASTERY in the moonlight. She's
suffering, her face a frozen mask.

HANA
I must be a curse - anybody
who loves me, anybody who
gets close to me - or I must
be cursed. Which is it?

The Patient laces her fingers into his crabbed hand.

EXT. THE MONASTERY. DAY

Hana is investigating the MONASTERY OF S. ANNA, wandering
through its overgrown gardens, past a pond. What sanctuary it
seems to offer.

INT. THE MONASTERY LIBRARY. DAY

Hana explores via a gaping hole in a LIBRARY where the walls
have collapsed from sheliing. The garden intrudes, ivy curls
around the shelves. Bloated books lie abandoned, and there's a
PIANO tilted up on one side. Hana presses the keys through the
filthy tarpaulin which covers it. Everywhere there are signs of
a brief German occupation.

INT. THE MONASTERY CLOISTERS. DAY

Past the Library is a CLOISTERS, drenched with silver light.
INT. THE MONASTERY STAIRS. DAY

Hana goes upstairs, negotiating a huge VOID in the stone treads
two thirds of the way up.

INT. THE PATIENT'S ROOM. DAY

She comes across a small CHAPEL with the remains of murals and
an altar pressed into service by the Germans as a table. Hana
finds an old bed and a mattress.

EXT. CONVOY SITE, ITALY. DAY

The Convoy is in the final stages of loading up. Oliver passes
the vehicles, deep in dispute with a determined Hana, who is
carrying some sacks of rice.

HANA
When he dies I'1l catch up.

OLIVER
It's not safe here. The whole
country's crawling with
Bandits and Germans and God
knows what.

HANA
The war's over - you told me
yourself. How can it be
desertion?

OLIVER
It's not over everywhere. I
didn’t mean literally. This
is normal - it’s shock. For
all of us. Hana -

Oliver hovers as Hana adds the rice to a small cache of
provisions then lays another blanket over The Patient.

HANA
I need morphine. A lot. And a
pistol.

OLIVER

If anything happened to you
I’d never forgive myself.

Hana nods. A tiny smile. Oliver shrugs heiplessly.
OLIVER
We‘re heading for Leghorn.

Livorno the Italians call it.
We'll expect you. —

10
INT. THE PATIENT’S ROOM. DAY.

TWO SOLDIERS are helping Mary and Hana carry The Patient into
what was the chapel. They lower The Patient onto the rusted
bed. Hana turns to the SOLDIERS.

HANA
Thank you.

She shuts the door on them, leaving Mary staring aghast at the
room, its faded frescoes, its mold, its starkness.

HANA
Good.

She goes to Mary and hugs her.
INT. THE MONASTERY, HANA‘S ROOM. DAY

A smaller upstairs room, completely bare. As Hana tugs off her
uniform, she looks out of the window to see the departing
Convoy. A cotton dress goes on over her head and she emerges
looking suddenly younger and rather fragile. Through the
damaged floor of her room she has a view of the patient below
her. She looks at him. Now she has scissors and starts to cut
off her hair, not aggressively, but in a gesture of a new
beginning.

INT. THE MONASTERY STAIRS. MORNING

Hana is dropping armfuls of books into the cavities of the
damaged stairs while, with others, she is improvising new
steps. The heavy volumes are perfect for treading on.

INT. THE PATIENT’S ROOM. DAY
Hana enters.

THE PATIENT
What was all the banging?
Were you fighting rats or the
entire German army?

HANA
I was repairing the stairs. I
found a library and the books
were very useful.

Hana shrugs. She’s attending to him, pulling back the sheets,
plumping up the pillows. He’s short of breath.

THE PATIENT
Before you find too many uses
for these books would you
read some to me?

11
CONTINUED

HANA
I think they’re all in
Italian, but I’11 look, yes.
What about your own book?

THE PATIENT
{reluctant)
My book? The Herodotus? Yes,
we can read him.

Hana picks up the book from the altar and hands it to him. Then
she starts rummaging in her pockets.

HANA
Oh - I‘ve found plums. We have
plums in the orchard. We have
an orchard!

THE PATIENT
Herodotus is the father of
history, do you know that?

HANA
I don't know anything.

THE PATIENT
Thank you.

She has peeled a plum and now slips it into his mouth. His mouth
works with the pleasure of the taste, a little juice escaping
from his lips. Hana mops it up.

THE PATIENT
It’s a very plum plum.

EXT. THE MONASTERY GARDENS. DAY

Hana sits in the water trough shivering as the cold water
splashes her.

INT. THE PATIENT'S ROOM. DAY

Close on the HERODOTUS. The Patient opens its cover, held
together by leather ties. Loose PAPERS, PHOTOGRAPHS, HAND-DRAWN
MAPS AND SKETCHES are all collected between the charred pages.
He claws at some papers, inspects a letter. Then he loses
control of the papers and the whole parcel SPILLS to the floor
with a crack.

EXT. BASE CAMP AT POTTERY HILL. DUSK

Count Laszlo de Almasy, Hungarian explorer, squats with an
ancient Arab who draws in the sand, talking in some arcane
dialect, scratching out a map. The old man stops speaking and
scours the sky a beat or two before we or Almasy hear the faint
noise of a PLANE. It’s a bright yellow Steerman coming in to

12
CONTINUED

land. Almasy doesn't look up. The Arab continues to talk. The
plane sweeps past the cluster of tents and camels and trucks
which constitutes the Base Camp for a team of international
explorers, led by Almasy and his colleague, Peter Madox.

EXT. BASE CAMP AT POTTERY HILL. DAY

The expedition team drives over to meet the arrivals. Almasy
stays in the car as the others pile out and approach the plane
as it taxis alongside an old, battered silver Tiger Moth.

A young couple emerge from the Steerman. They are GEOFFREY AND
KATHARINE CLIFTON.

And it’s immediately clear that Katharine is the woman in the
plane crash at the beginning of the film.

Madox makes all the introductions, introducing the rest of the
team - an Italian, D’Agostino; a German, Bermann; and an
Egyptian, FOUAD. Hands are shaken, hellos all round, as the
couple disembark in their leather flying gear.

EXT. BASE CAMP AT POTTERY HILL. LATE DAY

The party is in the shade of the tents. Geoffrey Clifton
produces a bottle of CHAMPAGNE and sets off the cork with a
flourish. Almasy joins the group. Madox nods over to the
Clifton plane.

CLIFTON
fo the International Sand
Club.

MADOX
Marvellous plane. Did you
look?

ALMASY
Yes.

CLIFTON

(beaming at Almasy)
Isn't it? Wedding present
from Katharine's parents.
We're calling it Rupert Bear.
Hello. Geoffrey Clifton.

MADOX
We can finally consign my old
bird to the scrap heap.
Almasy smiles and walks on towards the others.

D‘ AGOSTINO
Mrs. Clifton - Count Almasy.

13
CONTINUED

KATHARINE
(smiling, offering
her hand)
Hello. Geoffrey gave me your
monograph when I was reading
up on the desert. Very
impressive.

ALMASY
(stiff)
Thank you.

KATHARINE
I wanted to meet a man who
could write such a long paper
with so few adjectives.

ALMASY
A thing is still a thing no
matter what you place in
front of it. Big car, slow
car, chauffeur-driven car,
still a car.

CLIFTON
(joining them and
joining in)
A broken car?

ALMASY
Still a car.

CLIFTON
(hands them champagne)
Not much use, though.

KATHARINE
Love? Romantic love, platonic
love, filial love -? Quite
different things, surely?

CLIFTON
(hugging Katharine)
Uxoriousness - that’s my
favourite kind of love.
Excessive love of one’s wife.

ALMASY

(a dry smile)
Now there you have me.

14
EXT. BASE CAMP. MORNING

Almasy and Madox head for Madox’s Tiger Moth. They turn the
machine around like a toy, pointing it in the right direction
for take-off. During this Almasy complains and Madox mediates -
there’s a suspicion that this is a familiar dynamic.

ALMASY
They‘re tourists.

MADOX
Absolute rot. They come
highly recommended from the
Royal Geographic. She's
charming and has read
everything, he's meant to be
a ruddy good pilot.

ALMASY
We don‘t need another pilot.

MADOX
He can make aerial maps of the
entire area.

ALMASY

You can't explore from the
air, Madox. If you could
explore from the air life
would be very simple.

(he primes the

propellor)
Contact.

Madox slips on his goggles and turns on the engine.

MADOX
Contact.

Almasy spins the propellor. It flashes into life.
EXT. GILF KEBIR PLATEAU. MORNING.

Both planes are scouting the Gilf Kebir region. Geoffrey flies
up alongside Madox and wiggles his wings. Madox waves. They’re
flying over a distinctive group of GRANITE MASSIFS, Crater-
shaped hills. The broken towers of the Gilf Kebir. Almasy is
distracted by them. He turns to Madox and points down,
indicating they should explore them.

Madox nods and brings the plane lower and they fly into the

mouth of one of the huge craters. The Cliftons’ plane follows
them into the black ravines, pitted with signs of scrub.

15
Almasy gestures to the Cliftons to PHOTOGRAPH the Massifs. A
THUMBS UP from Geoffrey, who pulls out his camera and begins
shooting.

INT. THE PATIENT'S ROOM. MORNING.

Hana changes The Patient’s bed. The light streams in from the
open window. She looks up at the green hills rolling away from
the Monastery, the village in the distance.

HANA
I should try and move the bed.
I want you to be able to see
the view. It's good, it’s a
view from a monastery.

THE PATIENT
I can already see.

HANA
(bending down to his
level)
How? How can you see
anything?

THE PATIENT
No, not the window - I can’t
bear the light anyway - no, I
can see all the way to the
desert. Before the war.
Making maps.

HANA
I'm turning you.

THE PATIENT
Is there sand in my eyes. Are
you cleaning sand from my
ears?

HANA
No sand, that’s your morphine
speaking.

THE PATIENT
I can see my wife in that
view.

HANA
Are you remembering more?

THE PATIENT
Could I have a cigarette?

HANA
Are you crazy?

16
CONTINUED

THE PATIENT
Why are you so determined to
keep me alive?

HANA
Because I’m a nurse.

EXT. THE MONASTERY CLOISTERS. NIGHT

It’s dark. Hana is caught by the stray shafts of moonlight. She
is SCRATCHING on the flagstones. Her skirt is bunched up around
her thighs. She throws something in the air. It lands with a
erack. Suddenly she is flying across the space, a hop, a skip,
a jump. Then turns at the other end, dips for the stone, then
back again, in this blindman‘’s version of HOPSCOTCH.

INT. THE PATIENT'S ROOM. NIGHT

Alone in his room The Patient listens to the erratic rhythm of
Hana's hopscotch. It takes him back to the desert and the sound
of Bedouin drums on a night shortly after the arrival of the
Cliftons.

EXT. BASE CAMP. NIGHT

The group sits around the campfire at night, supper over,
champagne drunk. They're using the empty bottle to play a game
~ Spin the Bottle. When the bottle points at you, you're
required to perform a party piece. Clifton sings a version of
‘Yes, We Have No Bananas,’ then is required to translate it
into a variety of languages - the others joining in raucously.
D'Agostino offers a Puccini aria; Fouad dances, his shawi
whirling, the Bedouin onlookers providing a percussive,
improvised accompaniment.

INT. THE PATIENT’S ROOM. NIGHT

Later, and Hana is reading to The Patient from a story in his
Herodotus. As she reads, he listens, eyes closed, still in the
desert.

HANA

..-the King insisted he would
find some way to prove beyond
dispute that his wife was
fairest of all women. ‘I will
hide you in the room where we
sleep’, says Candaules -

(correcting herself)
- said Candaules.

She stumbles over the word. The Patient corrects her.

THE PATIENT
Candaules.

17
CONTINUED

HANA
Candaules.

EXT. BASE CAMP AT POTTERY HILL. NIGHT

Katharine has her turn at the fire. She is telling the same
story. The Patient remembers her.

KATHARINE
Canduales tells Gyges that
the queen has the same
practice every night. She
takes off her clothes and
puts them on the chair by the
door to her room...

HANA (0/S)
(continuing to read)
...and from where you stand
you will be able to gaze on
her at your leisure...

KATHARINE

(her story continuing)
And that evening it’s exactly
as the King has told him. She
goes to the chair and removes
her clothes one by one until
she’s standing naked in full
view of Gyges, and indeed she
was more lovely than he could
have imagined. But then the
Queen looked up and saw Gyges
concealed in the shadows, and
although she said nothing,
she shuddered. And the next
day she sent for Gyges and
challenged him. And hearing
his story, this is what she
said -

CLIFTON
(clowning)
Off with his head!

KATHARINE
- she said, “Either you must
submit to death for gazing on
that which you should not, or
else kill my husband who
shamed me and become King in
his place.”

Clifton makes a face of outrage. For Katharine the story has
suddenly collapsed. She feels Almasy’s eyes on her.

18
CONTINUED

KATHARINE

So Gyges kills the King and
marries the Queen and becomes
ruler of Lydia for twenty-
eight years.

(an uncomfortable

moment }
Shall I spin the bottle?

The others laugh. Madox beams at Clifton.

MADOX
So Geoffrey ~ let that be a
lesson to you.

INT. THE PATIENT'S ROOM. NIGHT

Hana looks up from the Herodotus, sees The Patient's eyes
closed. She gently touches his face and whispers.

HANA
Are you asleep?

THE PATIENT
(he isn’t)
Yes. No. Dropping off.

And Hana closes the book, gets up, kisses him good night, and
blows out the lamp.

EXT. THE MONASTERY, HANA’S GARDEN. LATE DAY

Hana has been reviving a vegetable patch. She comes out to
garden. CROWS are feasting. She’s furious, shouts, runs at
them. Nature, wildness, insisting on invading her peace.

EXT. THE MONASTERY, GRAVEYARD. MORNING

Hana appears from the cemetery, dragging A METAL CRUCIFIX. It’s
bigger than she is, and she drags it along towards her garden.
A MAN WATCHES HER FROM A BICYCLE, He's approaching fifty,
grizzled and attractive, and could be Italian. He wears a pair
of grubby mittens. The man, CARAVAGGIO, chooses this moment to
introduce himself. He drops the bicycle on the ground with a
clatter.

CARAVAGGIO
{very cheerful)
Buon Giorno!
Hana turns, startled and suspicious.

CARAVAGGIO
Hana?

19
CONTINUED

HANA
What do you want?

CARAVAGGIO
I met your friend Mary. She
said I should stop and see if
you were all right.
Apparently, we're neighbours
- my house is two blocks from
yours in Montreal. Cabot,
north of Laurier. Bonjour.

HANA
(unravelling this
information}

Bonjour.

He goes to her and hands her an egg, producing it from a pocket.
He beams, as does Hana.

CARAVAGGIO
I‘d like to take credit for
it, but it’s from Mary. My
name’s David Caravaggio, but
nobody ever called me David.
Caravaggio - they find too
absurd to miss out on.

During this he attempts to conjure a second egg from Hana‘s
ear. THE EGG DROPS TO THE GROUND. Cursing, he gets on his knees
and starts to scoop it up, preserving it. There appears to be
something wrong with his hands. He grimaces at Hana.

CARAVAGGIO
My stupid hands!

INT. THE MONASTERY KITCHEN. DAY

Hana has taken his eggs and put them into a bowl. She beats them
with a knife, picking out the bits of shell. Caravaggio watches,
takes in how little food there is otherwise. The table seems
useful more as a sewing area than for cooking - it’s strewn with
altar cloths being sewn into drapes. On a tray on the table are
TWO VIALS OF MORPHINE from The Patient’s room. As Hana turns to
the stove, Caravaggio’s moved and covered them with his gloved
hands a second later and he’s juggled them into his pocket.

CARAVAGGIO

(of the eggs)
They're fresh. I haven’t had
an egg in...have you noticed
there are chickens? In Italy
you get chickens but no eggs.
In Africa there were always
eggs, but never chickens. Who
separated them?

CONTINUED

HANA
(intrigued)
You were in Africa?

CARAVAGGIO
Yes I was.

HANA
So was my Patient.

CARAVAGGIO

Look, I’d like to stay for a
while. I have to do some work
here - I speak the language.
There are Partisans to be
disarmed -

(trying to paraphrase)
- we embrace them and see if
we can relieve them of their
weapons, you know - while we
hug. I was a thief, so the
Army thought I'd be good at

it.
HANA
So you can shoot a pistol?
CARAVAGGIO
(showing his hands)
No.
HANA
Do you have a problem with
those?
CARAVAGGIO
No.

HANA
I should iook at them before
you go.

CARAVAGGIO
Look, it’s a big place. We
needn't disturb each other.
I’1l sleep in the stabie. It
doesn't matter where I sleep.
I don‘t sleep.

HANA
I don’t know what Mary told
you about me, but I don’t need
company, I don’t need to be
iooked after.

21
INT. THE PATIENT’S ROOM. DAY
Hana carries in a tray. There's OMELETTE on the plate.
HANA

There's a man downstairs. He
brought us eggs. He might

stay.
THE PATIENT
Why? Can he lay eggs?
HANA
He’s Canadian.
THE PATIENT
(brittle)

Why are people always so
happy when they collide with
someone from the same place?
What happened in Montreal
when you passed a man in the
street - did you invite him to
live with you?

HANA
He needn‘t disturb you.

THE PATIENT
Me? He can't. I’m already
disturbed.

HANA
(she cuts the omelette
into tiny pieces)
There's a war. Where you come
from becomes important.

THE PATIENT
Why? I hate that idea.

INT. THE MONASTERY STAIRS. DAY

Caravaggio is in shadows in the hallway. He listens.

INT. THE PATIENT’S ROOM. DAY

Hana, having already replaced the bed linen, is standing on a
stepladder trying to hang homemade drapes around the bed as
Caravaggio knocks tentatively, then comes in.

CARAVAGGIO
Can I help?

HANA
It’s finished.

22
CONTINUED

THE PATIENT
So you’re our Canadian
pickpocket?

CARAVAGGIO
Thief, I think, is more
accurate.

THE PATIENT
I understand you were in
Africa. Whereabouts?

CARAVAGGIO
Oh, all over.

THE PATIENT
All over? I kept trying to
cover a very modest portion
and still failed.
{to Hana, who is
heading out)
Are you leaving us?

HANA
Yes.

THE PATIENT
Now’s our opportunity to swap
war wounds.

HANA
Then I'm definitely going.

And she exits. The men consider her.

CARAVAGGIO
Does she have war wounds?

INT. THE MONASTERY, HANA‘S ROOM. DAY

As Hana walks up her stairs she finds herself overhearing their
conversation as it threads up through the hole in the ceiling.
She strips her own bed of the curtain she uses for a sheet.

THE PATIENT
I think anybody she ever
loves tends to die on her.

CARAVAGGIO

Are you planning to be the
exception?

23
CONTINUED

THE PATIENT
Me? I think you’ve got the
wrong end of the stick, old
boy.
(a pause)
So, Caravaggio ~ Hana thinks
you invented your name.

CARAVAGGIO
And you’ve forgotten yours.

THE PATIENT
I said that no one would ever
invent such a preposterous
name.

CARAVAGGIO
I said you can forget
everything but you never
forget your name. Count
Almasy - that name mean
anything to you? Or Katharine
Clifton?

EXT. CAIRO MARKET. DAY

A STREET MARKET in full sway, a locals-only affair, blazing
with noise and bustle and barter. Emerging from a thicket of
women and begging children, KATHARINE CLIFTON carries her
purchase of an exotic-looking Carpet. From nowhere she is
joined by ALMASY, who nods at the carpet.

ALMASY
How much did you pay?

KATHARINE
(delighted)
Oh, Hello!

ALMASY
They don‘t see foreign women
in this market. How much did

you pay?

KATHARINE
Seven, eight pounds, I
suppose.

ALMASY

Which stall?

KATHARINE
Why?

24
CONTINUED

ALMASY
You've been cheated, don’t
worry, we'll take it back.

KATHARINE
(bristling)
I don’t want to take it back.

ALMASY
This is not worth eight
pounds, Mrs. Clifton.

KATHARINE
It is to me.

ALMASY
Did you bargain?

KATHARINE
I don't care to bargain.

ALMASY
That insults them.

KATHARINE
(turning to face him)
I don't believe that. I think
you are insulted by me,
somehow.

ALMASY

(of the carpet)
I'd be very happy to obtain
the correct price for this. I
apologize if I appear abrupt.
I am rusty at social graces.

(tart)
How do you find Cairo? Did you
visit the Pyramids?

KATHARINE
Excuse me.

ALMASY
Or the Sphinx?

He stands as she continues, pushing past him, boiling.

INT. SHEPHEARD'S HOTEL, CAIRO. EVENING

THE LONG BAR. The Exploration Team drinking at a table. They
are not entirely off-duty - Almasy and Madox, as ever, ponder

the maps.

25
CONTINUED

MADOX
By car? Impossible. If we try
and drive north of Kufra by
car, we’ll leave our bones in
the desert.

ALMASY
Disagree.

MADOX
You’re Hungarian, you always
disagree.

Geoffrey Clifton appears.

CLIFTON
Good evening, Gentlemen!

He sits down. Madox hails the waiter.

D‘AGOSTINO
How is your charming wife?

CLIFTON
Marvellous. She’s in love
with the hotel plumbing.
She's either in the swimming
pool - she swims for hours,
she’s a fish, quite
incredible ~ or she’s in the
bath. Actually, she’s just
outside.
(responding to their
bewildered
expressions)

Chaps Only in the Long Bar.

EXT. SHEPHEARD’S HOTEL TERRACE. NIGHT

The Explorers, embarrassed, march out onto the terrace.
Katharine sits, reading, exquisite in her evening clothes.
There is dancing inside, and couples walk to and from their
tables. Madox approaches to collect her. Katharine manages to
produce a dazzling smile which includes everyone except Almasy.

MADOX
Mrs. Clifton, you'll have to
forgive us. We’re not
accustomed to the company of
women.

KATHARINE

Not at all. I was thoroughly
enjoying my book.

26
CONTINUED

CLIFTON
The team is in mourning,
darling.

KATHARINE
Oh really?

MADOX
I’m afraid we’re not having
much luck obtaining funds for
the expedition.

KATHARINE
Oh. What will you do?

MADOX
A more modest expedition, or
even wait a year. Remind our
families we still exist.

CLIFTON
(astonished)
Good heavens, are you
Married, Madox?

MADOX
Very much so. We all are, save
my friend here.

He nods at Almasy. Clifton appears tremendously relieved.

CLIFTON
I feel much better, don’t you
darling? We were feeling
rather self-conscious. Let's
toast, then. To absent wives.

D‘ AGOSTINO
(toasting Katharine)
And present ones.

KATHARINE
(toasting Almasy)
And future ones.

INT. SHEPHEARD’S HOTEL. NIGHT

THE BALLROOM. A dance finishes. Almasy takes over from
D‘Agostino to partner Katharine. The others remain on the
terrace, deep in conversation.

KATHARINE
(as they dance)
Why did you follow me
yesterday?

27
CONTINUED

ALMASY
What? I’m sorry?

KATHARINE
After the market, you
followed me to the hotel.

ALMASY
I was concerned. A woman in
that part of Cairo, a
European woman, I felt

obliged to.
KATHARINE
You felt obliged to.
ALMASY
As the wife of one of our
party.
KATHARINE
(direct)

So why follow me? Escort me,
by all means. But following
me is predatory, isn’t it?

Almasy, by way of answer, bears down on her. They dance,
fierce, oblivious to everything.

INT. THE PATIENT’S ROOM. NIGHT

Hana has fallen asleep on the bed, almost on top of the
Patient. He touches her. He speaks as if each word burns him.

THE PATIENT
Could I ask you to move? I’m
sorry -

HANA
(mortified, moving
quickly)
I'm sorry, of course. I was
dreaming. Awful.

THE PATIENT
It’s just when you move -
HANA
How stupid of me.
THE PATIENT
I can’t really bear the

pressure.

Hana gets up, upset to have hurt him.

28
INT. THE MONASTERY KITCHEN. NIGHT

Hana comes to the table, carrying a jug of water and a bowl.
She’s still sad. She unbuttons her dress, pulling it off her
shoulder, begins to pour the water to cool herself against the
night's pressing heat. She’s overwhelmed by memories, by the
weight of her curse. Caravaggio comes into the kitchen to find
her slumped at the table, her back naked, the jug of water in
front of her. She's sobbing, her shoulders heaving. Caravaggio
approaches tentatively.

CARAVAGGIO
Hana?
(he touches her
shoulder)
Hana? Are you all right?

HANA
(without raising her
head)
Don‘t touch me.

She pulls her dress up around her shoulders. Her face is red
with weeping. Caravaggio pours a glass of water and walks to
the open window.

CARAVAGGIO
You’re in love with him,
aren’t you? Your poor
patient. Do you think he’s a
saint because of the way he
looks? I don’t think he is.

HANA
I'm not in love with him. I'm
in love with ghosts. So is he.
He’s in love with ghosts.

CARAVAGGIO
(he holds up his
hands)
What if I told you he did this
to me?

HANA
(stung)
How could he have? When?
CARAVAGGIO

I'm one of his ghosts and he
wouldn’t even know it.

HANA
I don’t know what that means.

29
CONTINUED

CARAVAGGIO
(shrugs)
Ask your saint who he is. Ask
him who he‘s killed.

HANA
(furious)
Please don’t creep around
this house!

She leaves, slamming the door behind her. Caravaggio calls

after her.

CARAVAGGIO
I don’t think he's forgotten
anything. I think he wants to
forget.

INT. TENT, BASE CAMP AT POTTERY HILL. NIGHT

The group of expeditioners is around the fire. Clifton holds up

a glass.

CLIFTON
Gentlemen, to Map-making!

ALL
Map-making!

MADOX
And a special thank-you to
Geoffrey and Katharine,
without whose fund-raising
heroics we’d still be kicking
our heels.

CLIFTON
To arm-twisting.

MADOX
(to Almasy)
Did Katharine say? Geoffrey
has to fly back to Cairo.

CLIFTON
Return the favour - take a few
photographs of the army.

ALMASY
What kind of photographs?

30
CONTINUED

CLIFTON
Portraits. The Brigadier, the
Brigadier's wife, the
Brigadier’s dogs, the
Brigadier by the Pyramids,
the Brigadier breathing. I
shall of course be bereft,
but finally able to explore
the Cairo nightlife. I shall
produce an authoritative
guide to the Zinc Bars and - I
want to say Harems ~ are we in
the right country for Harems?

EXT. BASE CAMP AT POTTERY HILL. MORNING

As Clifton prepares to leave in the Steerman, Almasy

approaches.

ALMASY
Clifton, safe journey.

CLIFTON
You too. Good luck!

ALMASY
Clifton - it’s probably none
of my business - but your
wife, do you think it's
appropriate to leave her?

CLIFTON
Appropriate?

ALMASY
Well the desert is - for a
woman - it’s very tough, I
wonder if it’s not too much
for her.

CLIFTON
Are you mad? Katharine loves
it here. She told me
yesterday.

ALMASY

All the same, were I you, I
would be concerned -

31
CONTINUED

CLIFTON
I‘ve known Katharine since
she was three, we were
practically brother and
sister before we were man and
wife. I think I'd know what is
and what isn’t too much for
her. I think she'd know
herself.

ALMASY
Very well.

CLIFTON
(laughing it off)
Why are you people so
threatened by a woman?!

Almasy watches him walk toward the plane, then turns to see
Katharine, a distant figure, watching. He doesn’t move. She
doesn’t move.

INT. MONASTERY LIBRARY. DAY

Hana stands at the PIANO. It’s still lop-sided, propped against
the wall. She tries but can’t move it. So she pulls off the dust
sheet and, with the instrument still on a tilt, begins to pick
out the Aria from Bach's Goldberg Variations.

INT. THE PATIENT’S ROOM. DAY

HANA’S PIANO CONTINUES. Upstairs, Caravaggio chats with The
Patient while working his arm to RAISE A VEIN, a bootlace tied
around it, preparing an injection for himself, tapping the
syringe. During this:

THE PATIENT
I have come to love that
little tap of the fingernail
against the syringe. Tap.
Tap. Tap.

INT. MONASTERY LIBRARY. DAY

Hana plays. A GUNSHOT punctuates the music. Her hands falter,
she looks up to see A SIKH SOLDIER running past the GAPING HOLE
IN THE WALL, his rifle held aloft. He approaches the french
doors, his face creased with anxiety, and raps on the shattered
frame. It’s KIP, the bomb disposal officer who had cleared the
road on which Jan's jeep had exploded.

KIP

Stop playing! Please, Stop
Playing!

32
CONTINUED

HANA
(of the doors)
I don’t have the key to that
door.

She watches him walk around from the locked doors and walk
straight through the hole in the wall, oblivious to any irony,
and up to the piano.

KIP
The Germans were here. The
Germans were all over this
area. They left mines
everywhere. And pianos were
their favourite hiding
places.

HANA
I see. Sorry.
(then mischievous)
Then maybe you’re safe as
long as you only play Bach.
He's German.

Kip is looking around the piano. Hana giggles.

KIP
Is something funny?

HANA
No, I’m sorry.

KIP
I’ve met you before.

HANA
I don’t think so.

KIP
Look. See. See.

Hana bends to see what Kip’s looking at under the piano. Wires
run from the wall to the instrument onto which is taped an
EXPLOSIVE CHARGE. If Hana had succeeded in moving the piano she
would have triggered the charge. Kip looks at Hana, who
conceals her dismay with a shrug.

KIP
(of the piano)
Move that, and no more Bach.
EXT. THE MONASTERY GARDEN. DUSK
Across from the terrace, KIP and his sergeant, HARDY, are

putting up their tents. Caravaggio stands, chatting amiably to
them, holding a haversack, smoking a cigarette.

33
INT. THE PATIENT'S ROOM. DUSK

Hana looks down from The Patient's room, watching the tent go
up. Kip glances up at the window. Hana, suddenly shy, backs
away.

HANA
He wants us to move out, says
there could be fifty more
mines in the building. He
thinks I’m mad because I
laughed at him. He’s Indian,
he wears a turban.

THE PATIENT
No he’s Sikh. If he wears a
turban, he’s Sikh.

HANA
I‘11 probably marry him.

THE PATIENT
Really? That’s sudden.

HANA
My mother always told me I
would summon my husband by
playing the piano.

She bathes The Patient.

HANA
I liked it better when there
were just the two of us.

THE PATIENT
(irked)
Why? Is he staying?

HANA
With his Sergeant. A
Mr. Hardy.

THE PATIENT
We should charge! Doesn't
anyone have a job to do?

HANA
They have to clear all the
roads of mines. That’s a big
job.

THE PATIENT

In that case, I suppose we
can’t charge.

34
CONTINUED

HANA
No, we can't.

EXT. THE MONASTERY, HANA’S GARDEN. DAY

HANA IS GARDENING, close to the crucifix, which is now a full-
fledged Scarecrow. Broken bottles, fragments of stained glass,
and shards from a mirror are hung from the crossbar, syringes
too, all jangling and tinkling and catching the sunlight.

Kip and Hardy drive off to work on their motorcycles. She
watches them, catching Kip’s careless wave to her. She looks
briefly at herself in A PIECE OF MIRROR dangling from the
Scarecrow.

INT. THE PATIENT'S ROOM. DAY
The Patient lies in bed singing to himself in Arabic.
EXT. BASE CAMP AT POTTERY HILL

The THREE FORD CARS leave the campsite, loaded for a scouting
expedition. The rest of the party, Bedouin, tents, camels, and
Tiger Moth - is left behind.

INT. CAR EN ROUTE TO CAVE OF SWIMMERS. DAY

Almasy drives the second car, accompanied by Katharine and Al
Auf, who sits on top of the cabin. Almasy sings as they drive.
Katharine breaks the long silence between them.

KATHARINE
I’ve been thinking - how does
somebody like you decide to
come to the desert? What is
it? You’re doing whatever
you're doing - in your
castle, or wherever it is you
live - and one day you say I
have to go to the desert - or
what?

Almasy doesn’t answer. Katharine, who has looked at him for an
answer, looks away. There's another long silence.

ALMASY
I once travelled with a
guide, who was taking me to
Faya. He didn't speak for
nine hours. At the end of it
he pointed at the horizon and
said, “Faya!” That was a good
day.

Point made, they lapse again into silence. Katharine boils.

35
CONTINUED

KATHARINE
Actually, you sing.

ALMASY
What?

KATHARINE
You sing. All the time.

ALMASY
I do not.

KATHARINE
Ask Al Auf.

In Arabic, Almasy asks Al Auf, who promptly laughs, nods and
sings a snatch of what he thinks is the tune to ‘The Darktown
Strutter’s Ball’. Katharine, delighted, joins in.

KATHARINE
(sings wickedly)
I‘1l be down to get you in the
taxi, honey, you'd better be
ready about half-past
eight...

Al Auf nods and grins furiously, joins in, impersonating
Almasy. Almasy makes a face.

EXT, NEAR THE BASE CAMP AT THE CAVE OF SWIMMERS. DUSK

The group is investigating a cleft in the rocky massif. They
climb slowly. Below them, A NEW AND TEMPORARY BASE CAMP.

The group winds around the rock. Almasy turns to offer a hand
to Katharine behind him, pulling her up to the next rock slab.

The group stops at a level plateau. The Arabs stand apart and
SING THEIR PRAYERS AT DUSK. Al Auf leads the incantations.

AL AUF
Allah Akbar, Allahu Akbar...

The Westerners wait respectfully. As the sun sets in glory,
Almasy looks over at the range of rocks. One particular range
seems to look exactly like A WOMAN’S BACK. He squints at the
rocks, then pulls out his Herodotus to compare his sketch map
with the terrain in front of him.

36
EXT. CAVE OF SWIMMERS. DUSK

Almasy clambers up the rocks, coming through a narrow crevice
to find A NATURAL SHELF. He scrambles up this path, reaching
up, only to notice that his hand almost perfectly covers A
CARVED HAND on the rock, and as he digests this he realizes he
has climbed past what is THE MOUTH OF A CAVE. He disappears
inside.

INT. CAVE OF SWIMMERS. FLASHLIGHT

A FLASHLIGHT squirts into the cave. Almasy treads cautiously
along the narrow winding passage. He comes to an open cavern
and takes his flashlight up to a wall. Almasy is astonished by
what he sees.

EXT. NEAR THE CAVE OF SWIMMERS. EVENING

The others watch as a flashlight bobs and jerks among the rocks
and Almasy comes scrambling down, transformed into an excited
teenager.

ALMASY
Madox! Madox! Madox, come
quickly! Bermann, D'Ag - I’ve
found something.

INT. CAVE OF SWIMMERS. FLASHLIGHT

PAINTINGS EMERGE, figures, animals. Ancient pictures. A
giraffe. Cattle. Fish. Men with bows and arrows. Almasy has led
the whole party into the heart of the cave. Now Madox comes
alongside him at the wall, his flashlight joining Almasy’s and
increasing the visibility of the paintings. A dark-skinned
figure, apparently in the process of DIVING into water, comes
clearly into view. Then others, supine, arms outstretched.

MADOX
(with audible
excitement)
My God, they’re swimming!
They're swimming!

The others crowd around. Five excited faces in the green gloom
of the cave.

INT. CAVE OF SWIMMERS. DAY

Katharine is painting. She copies the cave paintings with
meticulous, almost scientific accuracy.

37
EXT. CAVE OF SWIMMERS. DAY

A hive of activity. The team has set up TRESTLES to catalogue
the finds as the Bedouin come out with baskets of detritus,
which they empty onto a growing heap as the Cave is cleared
out. Almasy clambers inside carrying camera equipment.

INT. CAVE OF SWIMMERS. DAY

Inside, Bermann is setting up LAMPS, running wires from a car
BATTERY. Kamal is helping him. And as Almasy arrives he catches
a tiny moment of tenderness between them. Bermann, seeing him,
quickly disengages and busies himself with the lights.

EXT. THE DESERT. DAY

The CARS are heading back to Base Camp. They bounce over the
sand.

INT. BERMANN’S CAR. DAY

Bermann is driving the lead CAR along some STEEP DUNES. Almasy
beside him. Bermann is peeling AN ORANGE, a segment of which he
holds out of the window. Kamal, riding shotgun, leans down and
collects it, his head dipping in to grin at Bermann. Bermann
looks uneasily at Almasy. He wants to tell him of his passion,
of his absolute love for Kamal, but he daren’t.

BERMANN
How do you explain? To
someone who’s never been
here? Feelings which seem
guite normal.

ALMASY
(compassionate)
I don’t know, my friend. I
don’t know.

Bermann holds out another segment of the orange, and watches
Kamal bend into view, opening his mouth to be fed another
piece, then suddenly fall from the vehicle. THE CAR LURCHES
SIDEWAYS AND TOPPLES OVER THE EDGE. D’Ag - following, Fouad
beside him - brakes sharply, but can’t stop his own car from
being caught in the avalanche of sand, and IT PLUNGES DOWN THE
DUNE AND INTO BERMANN’S UPTURNED CAR WITH AN OMINOUS CRUNCH,
the radiator exploding. Only Madox, a little way behind, with
Katharine beside him, manages to stay clear of trouble. He
jumps out of the vehicle and slides down the dune to find
pandemonium as the passengers stumble out of the cars, sand
flying, smoke pouring from the upright vehicle, the wheels of
the overturned car spinning wildly in the air, a puddle of oil
spreading ominously.

38
EXT. THE DESERT. DAY

LATER and the group have cleaned up as best as possible. D'Ag,
Bermann, and Fouad are a little worse for wear. Fouad’s arm is
in a sling, and D’Ag is sporting a bloody head bandage. Bermann
has broken a finger and is being attended to by Madox. The

luggage, water, and petrol have been stacked up and the men are
loading the remaining car.

EXT. THE DESERT. DAY

Almasy, Kamal and two of the other young Bedouin stand around
the mess of the two broken vehicles. The ONE WORKING CAR is
loaded with men and provisions. Katharine sits inside, next to

Madox. Almasy comes over to her window, to speak past her to
Madox.

MADOX
I'll be back as quick as I
can. Thirty-six hours at the
outside.

ALMASY
Try to get an additional
radiator. We can store it
between here and Pottery
Hill. And a better jack. We
planned badly.

MADOX
(nods at Almasy, then
shouts over to the
wrecked vehicles)
Bermann!

This is Bermann’s cue to take leave of Kamal, who is staying
behind. Kamal makes a little bow.

KAMAL
(in Arabic)
May God make safety your
companion.

Bermann nods and hurries away, squeezing into the car, which
jolts off, bouncing over the track.

The vehicle gets about twenty yards, Almasy watching, before it
sinks forlornly into the soft sand. It’s hopelessly overloaded
with people. They all get out.

MADOX
(irascible)
Now what?

KATHARINE
I‘1l stay behind, of course.

39
CONTINUED

MADOX
Certainly not.

KATHARINE
No, I insist. There clearly
isn’t room for all of us, I’m
the least able to dig, and I’m
not one of the walking
wounded. It’s only one night!
Besides, if I remain it’s the
most effective method of
persuading my husband to
abandon whatever he’s doing
and come and rescue us.

It's hard to argue with this logic. Almasy shrugs.

LATER - THE MADOX CAR makes a more effective departure. Almasy
watches it disappear then turns, uncomfortable, to see
Katharine walk down the steep face of the dune toward the
makeshift shelter.

INT. SHELTER. DAY

Almasy sits alone, writing into HIS HERODOTUS, a map folded in
front of him, from which he makes notes. Katharine comes across
with a clutch of her SKETCHES from the Cave wall. Hands them to
him. They’re beautiful.

KATHARINE
I thought you might like to
paste them into your book.

ALMASY
Well, we took photographs,
there’s no need.

KATHARINE
No really, I’d like you to
have them.

ALMASY
(handing them back)
Well, there is really no
need. They're too good. This
is just a scrapbook. I should
feel obliged. Thank you.

KATHARINE
(exasperated)
And that would be
unconscionable, I suppose,
wouldn't it, to feel any
obligation? Yes. Of course it
would.

40
CONTINUED

She’s already turning, heading back up the slope, leaving the
perimeter of the shelter.

EXT. THE DESERT. NIGHT.

Katharine sits alone on top of the Dune, smoking, surveying the
landscape. Below her the camp - a fresh wind flicking at the
tarpaulin, The deep tracks of Madox’s car stretching off
towards civilization. Almasy heads up towards her.

ALMASY
You should come into the
shelter.

KATHARINE
I'm quite all right, thank
you.

ALMASY
Look over there.

Katharine turns, scans the horizon.

KATHARINE
What am I looking at?

ALMASY
Do you see what's happening
to them - the stars?

KATHARINE
They’re so untidy. I’m just
trying to rearrange them.

ALMASY
No, no, over there. In a few
minutes there will be no
stars. The air is filling
with sand.

On the distant dunes an ominous, boiling cloud.
EXT. VEHICLES. NIGHT

. The team hurries around salvaging gasoline drums, water cans,
bringing anything loose or light inside the vehicles. The WIND
is whipping up. the air busy with sand. Chaos as they struggle
in ever-worsening conditions, their heads wrapped in blankets,
flashlights useless. They seek safety in two groups, the
tribesmen to the cabin of the overturned car, Katharine and
Almasy to the upright one.

41
INT. CAR. NIGHT

Inside the cabin, the sand swirling around them, Katharine and
Almasy sit without speaking. He pours a little water so that
they can wash out their eyes and noses and mouths. She takes
her silk scarf, wets it, presses it to her face.

KATHARINE

This is not very good, is it?
ALMASY

No.
KATHARINE

Shall we be all right?
ALMASY

Yes. Yes. Absolutely.
KATHARINE

Yes is a comfort. Absolutely

is not.
EXT. THE DESERT. NIGHT

The sand is piling up against the two cars, the tent is swept
from its moorings, the water cans are hurled up, too, and then
plunge ominously into sand drifts as if going under an ocean.

ALMASY (0/S)
..-let me tell you about
winds. There is a whirlwind
from Southern Morocco, the
Aajej, against which the
fellahin defend themselves
with knives. And there is the
Ghibli from Tunis which rolls
and rolls and rolls and
produces a rather strange
nervous condition...

And we hear Katharine’s laugh.

INT. CAR. NIGHT

Almasy sits alongside Katharine, whose head is against his
shoulder. He continues his story of winds.

ALMASY
-+.and then there is the
Harmatton, a red wind which
Mariners call the sea of
darkness. Red sand from this
wind has flown as far as the
south coast of England
apparently producing showers

42
CONTINUED

ALMASY (cont ‘d)
so dense they were mistaken
for blood...

KATHARINE
Fiction. We have a house on
that coast, and it has never,
never rained blood.

ALMASY
No, it’s all true.
(teasing her)
Herodotus, your friend -

KATHARINE
(laughs)
My friend!

ALMASY
- he writes about it and he
writes about a wind, the
Simoon, which a nation
thought was so evil they
declared war on it and
marched out against it in
full battle dress.

He's touching Katharine's hair, he can’t help it. She is
paralysed by his touch, then puts out her hand and traces
across the window, now entirely silted up with sand.

INT. PATIENT’S ROOM. NIGHT.

The Patient remembers. He feels Katharine’s fingers tracing
across his face.

EXT. THE DESERT. DAY

MORNING. The sand has almost COMPLETELY ENGULFED the car on the
exposed side, covering the windscreen like snow, and
encroaching onto the door of the protected flank.

INT. CAR. DAY.

Almasy is awaken by the sound of A DISTANT ENGINE. He jerks up,
waking Katharine in the process, and heaves against the door.

ALMASY
Quick. Katharine. Quick, wake
up! I can hear a car. Let me

out.
(he stumbles out of
the car, up the dune,
then stops and flies
back to the car)

The flare!

43
CONTINUED

ALMASY (cont‘d)
(berating himself)
Idiot! To fall asleep.
Unforgiveable.

EXT. THE DESERT. DAY

MADOX’S CAR IS ROARING ALONG THE HORIZON. Almasy runs back into
the car, finds his flaregun, and SENDS A FLARE high into the
sky. Katharine is with him now, and they watch, helplessly, as
the car bounces away from them, Madox a man on a mission.
Katharine panics, THE SAND HAS ERASED ALL TRACE OF THEM.
Katharine waves her arms frantically.

KATHARINE
Here! We’re here! Stop!

ALMASY
Madox! Madox!

KATHARINE
Our tracks have disappeared.

ALMASY
Madox will calculate how many
miles; he'll soon turn
around.

Katharine is frightened. He looks at her.

ALMASY
Could I ask you, please, to
paste your paintings into my
book? I should like to have
them. I should be honoured.

A car horn leaks into their conversation. Almasy can't place it
at first ~ he’d assumed it was Madox. Now he realises it's
coming from the floor of the sand dune. He suddenly turns and
charges away from Katharine.

ALMASY
The others!

Katharine, horrified, follows him towards the mound of sand
which has completely buried the other vehicle.

KATHARINE
Awful. We must get them out!
How awful.

Almasy is preoccupied. He’s gone back to their vehicle and
returns with a shovel, STARTS TO DIG FRANTICALLY. Katharine
kneels beside him and helps to shovel away the sand. During
this:

44
CONTINUED

KATHARINE
Am I a terrible coward to ask
how much water we have?

ALMASY
(shovelling hard)
We have a little in our can,
we have water in the radiator
which can be drunk. It’s not
cowardly at all, it’s
extremely practical.
(anxious at not
uncovering the boys,
egging himself on)
Come on, come on!
(then back to
Katharine)
There's also a plant - I
believe you can cut a piece
the size of a heart from this
plant and the next morning it
will be filled with a
delicious liquid.

KATHARINE
Find that plant. Cut out its
heart.

They hear NOISES, scrabbling, faint thumps. Almasy scrapes at
the sand and they find the glass of the car. The angle of the
cab, tilted up to the sky, has made it impossible for the
trapped boys to lever it open. Their oxygen is rapidly
deteriorating. Almasy pulls on the door and it cranks open. The
boys, dazed, guiping in the fresh air, clamber out.

EXT. THE DESERT. DAY

Katharine sits in the car, putting her pictures into the
Herodotus. It’s full of ALMASY’S HANDWRITING, PHOTOGRAPHS, SOME
PRESSED FLOWERS. She deciphers a page of his words and
drawings. It's almost exclusively about her, the lines studded
with Ks. She reads, astonished, then looks at him as he and two
of the three Bedouin circle the area of the cars in ever-
widening circles, like water-diviners, like Kip searching for
mines. Almasy suddenly drops to his knees and begins to shovel
into the sand. He pulis out A CAN OF WATER. Turns to Katharine
and holds it triumphantly in the air.

INT. THE DESERT. NIGHT
A red umbrella of light as Almasy fires the last flare into the

black night. Katharine comes up beside him. They wait in
silence, hope fading with the flare.

45
CONTINUED

KATHARINE

(blank)
Geoffrey's not in Cairo.

(Almasy looks at her)
He's not actually a buffoon.
And the plane wasn’t a
wedding present. It belongs
to the British Government.
They want aerial maps of the
whole of North Africa. So I
think he's in Ethiopia. In
case you were counting on his
sudden appearance.

ALMASY
And the marriage - is that a
fiction?

There’s a beat. Katharine has a hundred answers.

KATHARINE
No, the marriage isn't a
fiction.

The light from the flare fades on them and they stand in the
dark. Suddenly on the far horizon, behind their heads, an
answering flare fireworks into the sky.

KATHARINE
Thank God. Oh thank God.

There's excited shouting from the boys. Then a distant reply.
Almasy laughs with relief.

ALMASY
It’s Madox.

He turns to Katharine. She shudders.

KATHARINE
Am I K in your book? I think I
must be.

Almasy turns to her. He runs the blade of his arm across her
neck.

INT. THE MONASTERY, UPSTAIRS LANDING. DAY

Hana walks along the landing with a tray. There’s a message on
several doors in the corridor from Kip: SAFE, then a couple
with the warning: DANGER. She hears noise from The Patient’s
room. Listens for a second before going in. Kip is reading to
The Patient.

KIP (0/8)

“He sat, in defiance of
municipal orders, astride the
gun Zamzammah on her brick
platform opposite the old

(he breaks off)
I can’t read these words.
They stick in my throat.

THE PATIENT (0/S)
Because you're reading it too
fast!

KIP (0/S)
Not at all.

THE PATIENT (0/S)

You have to read Kipling
slowly! Your eye is too
impatient - think about the
speed of his pen.

(quoting Kipling to

demonstrate)
What is it? “He sat” comma “in
defiance of municipal orders”
comma “astride the gun
Zamzammah on her brick”...
what is it?

INT. THE PATIENT’S ROOM. DAY

During this, Hana comes through with the tray, finds Kip
perched on the window, relishing his skirmish with The Patient,
who has condensed milk dribbling down his neck.

KIP
“Brick platform opposite the
old Ajaib-Gher -”

THE PATIENT
“— The Wonder House” comma
“as the natives called the
Lahore Museum.”

KIP
It’s still there, the cannon,
outside the museum. It was
made of metal cups and bowls
taken from every household in
the city as tax, then melted
down. Then later they fired
the cannon at my people comma
the natives. Full stop.

47
CONTINUED

THE PATIENT
So what is it you object to -
the writer or what he’s
writing about?

KIP
What I really object to,
Uncle, is your finishing all
my condensed milk.
(snatching up the
empty can)
And the message everywhere in
your book - however slowly I
read it - that the best
destiny for India is to be
ruled by the British.

THE PATIENT
Hana, we have discovered a
shared pleasure - the boy
and I.

HANA
Arguing about books.

THE PATIENT
Condensed milk - one of the
truly great inventions.

KIP
(grinning, leaving)
I’1l get another tin.

Hana and The Patient are alone.

HANA
I didn’t like that book
either. It’s all about men.
Too many men. Just like this
house.

THE PATIENT
You like him, don’t you? Your
voice changes.

HANA
I don’t think it does.
{a beat)
Anyway, he’s indifferent to
me.

THE PATIENT

I don’t think it's
indifference.

Kip comes bounding in with a fresh can.

THE PATIENT
Hana was just telling me you
were indifferent -

BANA

Well, I’m indifferent to
cooking, not Hana’s cooking
in particular.

with a bayonet)
Have either of you ever tried
condensed milk sandwiches?

EXT. CAIRO. DAY

ANOTHER WORLD as a honking TAXI containing Almasy and Katherine
negotiates the pell-mell bustle of Cairo.

EXT. SHEPHEARD’S HOTEL. DAY

Almasy, still in the same clothes, and evidently weary, emerges
from the cab, and pulls Katharine’s belongings from the trunk,
then holds open the door for her. As she walks toward the
hotel, he hands her bag to a porter. Katharine is stung.

KATHARINE
Will you not come in?

ALMASY
No. I should go home.

KATHARINE
will you please come in?

ALMASY

Katharine turns, disgusted.

KATHARINE

Katharine fishes the book from her knapsack, shoves it at him,
then disappears.

INT. ALMASY’S ROOM. DAY

Almasy lying on a camp bed, face down. The walls are covered
with maps, enlargements of photographs. A fan whirs over his
kit which is spread, unravelled but ordered, on the stone
floor. An ineffably male room, the shutters closed, just the
thinnest shaft of light piercing the gloom. Almasy hasn’t even
removed his clothes, his boots kicked off below his jutting
feet.

There’s A KNOCK at the door. Almasy sleeps. Another. A third.
He's roused from the dead.

It's Katharine. She’s bathed, luminous, stands backlit by the
afternoon sun - an angel in a cotton dress. He walks towards
her and she slaps him shockingly hard. He KNEELS before her,
head at her thighs. Katharine beats on his head and shoulders,
violently, then stops, her face expressionless.

KATHARINE
You still have sand in your
hair.

He pulls back, to look at her. She kneels and covers his face
with kisses. He pulls blindly at her dress and it RIPS across
her breasts.

INT. BATHROOM. DAY

Almasy is in the bath. Katharine, wearing his dressing gown,
pours in a jug of steaming water. Almasy leans over the rim of
the bath. He’s singing and sewing, carefully repairing the torn
dress.

KATHARINE

I’m impressed you can sew.
ALMASY

Good.
KATHARINE

You sew very badly.

ALMASY
You don’t sew at all!

KATHARINE
A woman should never learn to
sew, and if she can she
shouldn’t admit to it. Close
your eyes.

50

ALMASY
(laughs)
That makes it harder still.

She pushes the sewing from his hands, then pours water over his
head, then begins to shampoo his hair.

Almasy is in heaven. The biggest smile we have seen from him.
She continues to massage his scalp.

ALMASY
When were you most happy?
KATHARINE
Now.
ALMASY
When were you least happy?
KATHARINE

ALMASY

What do you love?

KATHARINE
What do I love?

ALMASY
Say everything.

KATHARINE
Let me see... I love water,
the fish in it. Hedgehogs!
I love hedgehogs.

She rinses his hair, then slips off the robe and CLIMBS IN
BESIDE HIM, covering his neck and shoulders in kisses.

ALMASY
And what else?

KATHARINE
Marmite - I'm addicted! Baths

Islands. Your handwriting.
I could go on all day.

ALMASY

Go on all day.

Almasy looks away.

ALMASY

KATHARINE
A lie. What do you hate most?

ALMASY
Ownership. Being owned. When
you leave, you should

She freezes, pushes him away, pulls herself out of the bath.

She picks up her dress, the thread and needle dangling from it,
and walks, dripping, out of the room.

INT. THE PATIENT’S ROOM. DAY

Hana sits reading from the Herodotus. She pulis out a
photograph of a small child.

HANA

Next she shows The Patient the page where a CHRISTMAS CRACKER
WRAPPER covered in handwriting has been glued in.

That's a Christmas cracker.
It was a Christmas cracker. A

EXT. AMBASSADOR’ S RESIDENCE, DECEMBER 1938. DAY

A CHRISTMAS PARTY FOR THE TROOPS, The incongruous attempts to
create a traditional Christmas in the dusty heat of Cairo. The
party is in the courtyard of the Moorish Palace, which serves
as the private residence of the British Ambassador, SIR RONNIE
HAMPTON. Lots of wives, including LADY HAMPTON and Katharine,
help serve tea and cake to the SOLDIERS who sit at rudimentary
tables with paper plates and paper hats. A man dressed as SANTA
CLAUS is giving out presents — PENGUIN PAPERBACKS , CHOCOLATE.
Christmas carols leak from a loudspeaker. Officers and
Civilians walk the perimeter. one of these, arriving, is
Almasy. He sits in the shade, catches Katharine’s attention.
Katharine brings him over a cup of tea and a plate with
Christmas cake on it.

ALMASY
Say you're sick.

KATHARINE
What? No!
ALMASY
Say you're feeling faint -

woman who pushes a
trolley with teapots)
Philippa, this is empty.

ALMASY
I‘m trying to write with your
taste in my mouth.
(as she leaves)
Swoon. I‘1l catch you.

Almasy sits watching the party. The Santa Claus is dragged
outside by some excited Children. Almasy picks at his cake,
removing the thick marzipan icing. He’s writing on A CHRISTMAS
CRACKER WRAPPER, smoothing it out - “December 22nd. Betrayals
in war are childlike compared with our betrayals du -"

Katharine, attending to a table, suddenly sags at the knees,
and SWOONS. People rush to her.

LADY HAMPTON

silly.

OFFICER'S WIFE

INT. STOREROOM. AMBASSADOR’S RESIDENCE. DAY

A small STOREROOM inside the Palace - Brooms, Mops, Cleaning
Equipment. Outside, the party is visible as opaque shadows
through the bevelled glass of the ornate window. The sound of
carols sung by the enlisted men gives way to a version of
“SILENT NIGHT” played on a solitary bagpipe. Inside, Almasy and
Katharine make love in the darkness. It’s as if the world has
stopped and there’s only their passion, overwhelming reason and
logic and rules.

INT. CORRIDORS, AMBASSADOR’S RESIDENCE. DAY

A CORRIDOR. Almasy appears and almost immediately collides with
the man dressed as SANTA CLAUS.

CLIFTON

INT. SIDE ROOM IN AMBASSADOR’S RESIDENCE. ‘DAY

The approach to the Shepheard’s Hotel. Geoffrey Clifton in a
TAXI, champagne between his knees.

The car ahead of them SCREECHES TO A HALT as a WOMAN hurries
across the street. The driver honks his horn angrily. The woman
puts up a hand in apology as she skips across the street to
another taxi. IT’S KATHARINE - she asks the driver for an
address in the old town.

Geoffrey, at first excited, is troubled by Katharine’s
expression. Then he sees her skip and his whole being
punctures.

Katharine’s cab roars off. His own car jerks forward.

CLIFTON
Stop! Stop here.

Geoffrey sits in the cab. Fifty yards short of the hotel. The
world rushes by.

Katharine is in bed. Almasy has just put A RECORD on. It's the

one day he falls under the
spell of a mysterious English
woman - a harpy - who beats
him and hits him and he
becomes her slave and sews
her clothes and worships the
hem of her-

Katharine had thought for a few seconds he was serious, then
she catches on and starts to beat him.

ALMASY

Ouch! See - you’re always
beating me...!

KATHARINE
You bastard, I was believing
you! You should be my slave.

They embrace, he lies over her, considering her naked back.

ALMASY
I claim this shoulder blade -
no, wait - I want - turn over

He turns her over, kisses her throat, then traces the hollow
indentation.

Almasy and Katharine wander out of his building and into the
early morning streets, hand in hand.

EXT. SPICE MARKET, CAIRO. DAWN

The MORNING PRAYERS rise out from the city’s three Minarets.

ALMASY
Yes. It’s full of saffron,

thimble to Katharine.

ALMASY

Geoffrey, unshaven, slumped in the taxi, watches as Katharine
crosses the street and heads towards the hotel. His expression
is terrible, trying to smile, his face collapsed.

INT. THE PATIENT'S ROOM. MORNING

“Cheek to Cheek” leaks into the room from a GRAMOPHONE that
Caravaggio stands over proudly. The Patient opens his eyes - is
confused, dislocated - stares blankly at Caravaggio.

CARAVAGGIO

(grinning)
Thought you'd never wake up!

62
CONTINUED

THE PATIENT
What?

Hana comes in, sleepily, frowns at the gramophone.

HANA
Where did you find that?

CARAVAGGIO
I liberated it.

HANA
I think that’s called
looting.

CARAVAGGIO
(relaxed)
No one should own music. The
real question is, who wrote

the song?

THE PATIENT
Irving Berlin.

CARAVAGGIO
For?

THE PATIENT
Top Hat.

: CARAVAGGIO
Is there a song you don’t
know?

HANA

(speaking for him)
No. He sings all the time.

She goes over to The Patient and kisses him gently.

HANA
Good morning.
(of his singing)
Did you know that? You’re
always singing.

THE PATIENT
I‘ve been told before.

HANA
Kip’s another one.

She goes to the window, looks over to where the tents are
pitched, sees Hardy shaving and Kip in the process of washing
his hair, his turban hanging like a ribbon between two trees to
dry. He’s perched a bowl and is dipping his long coal-black

hair into it. As Hana watches Kip, Caravaggio changes the
record. The Patient identifies it immediately.

ALMASY
“Wang Wang Blues.”

CARAVAGGIO
You‘re incredible!

EXT. MONASTERY GARDEN. MORNING.

Hana walks towards the tent, and passes Hardy. She’s carrying a
small cup, which she’s a little furtive about. He’s carrying a
whole armada of OIL LIGHTS. He nods upstairs.

HARDY
Good morning, miss.

HANA

Hello. You saved my life. I
haven't forgotten.

(Hardy waves that

away)
I thought you were very very
tall. You seemed so big and -
a giant! - and I felt like a
child who can’t keep her
balance.

HARDY
(does a little mime)
A toddler.

HANA
(smiles)
A toddler.

She goes on outside, and tentatively approaches Kip, who’s
still working at his hair.

HANA
My hair was long. At some
point. I’ve forgotten what a
nuisance it is to wash.

He continues to wash. She holds up the cup of oil.
HANA
Try this. I found a great jar
of it. Olive oil.

KIP
Thank you.

She stands for a second, just wanting to be close, then shyly
walks away. Kip examines the oil, calls after her.

64
CONTINUED

KIP
Is this for my hair?

HANA
(turning, smiling)
Yes, for your hair.

INT. THE PATIENT’S ROOM. EVENING.

Caravaggio is with The Patient. They sit lost in the jazz
they're listening to. The Patient regards Caravaggio.

THE PATIENT
There was a general who wore a
patch over a perfectly good
eye. The men fought harder
for him. Sometimes I think I
could get up and dance.

Caravaggio doesn’t respond.

THE PATIENT
What’s under your mittens?
(still nothing from
Caravaggio)
What’s under your mittens?

Caravaggio stands, goes to him, removing his mittens.
INT. BRITISH HEADQUARTERS, TOBRUK, JUNE 1942. DAY.

Caravaggio, thumbs intact and wearing a crumpled linen suit,
walks through the mangled corridors of British HQ. Smoke is
rising from buildings, the ominous scream of Stuka dive-bombers
in the distance as the harbour is pounded, the steady thud of
explosions. TOBRUK IS UNDER SIEGE. BHQ is a place in the throes
of dismantling itself. SECRETARIES are visiting braziers manned
by ARAB BOYS who stoke the fires as boxes of restricted papers
are fed into them. ASHES hover in the air.

INT. BHQ. TOBRUK DAY.

Caravaggio walks through a large room crowded with desks. From
one of them, a young woman, AICHA, frowning at the chaos and
the shelling, approaches him. AICHA is Caravaggio’s sometime
lover.

AICHA
He's waiting for you. I‘11
see you tonight?
INT. CORRIDOR OF BRITISH HEADQUARTERS, TOBRUK. DAY
Fenelon-Barnes and Caravaggio make their way down the stairs

and to the entrance. Aicha passes them on the stairs, looks
anxiously at Caravaggio.

65
CONTINUED

FENELON-BARNES
Look, Moose, we need you to
stay in Tobruk. I know it’s a
bit of a short straw but the
thinking is we'll be back - I
mean, we will, we will be back
- but we need eyes and ears on
the ground. Jerry's got our
maps, you know. Swine. Before
the war we helped them run
about the desert making maps
- and now they’re getting
spies into Cairo using our
maps, they'11 get Rommel into
Cairo using our maps. The
whole of the desert’s like a
bloody bus route and we gave
it to them. Any foreigner who
turned up - “Welcome to the
Royal Geographic, take our
maps.” Old Madox went mad,
you know - did you know Peter
Madox? - magnificent explorer
- after he found out he'd been
betrayed by Almasy, his best
friend. Absolutely destroyed
the poor sod. I’d love to get
that bastard Almasy. Settle
the score.

EXT. TOBRUK. DAY

The Germans invade Tobruk. They drop to the ground in cluster
of parachutes. The harbour rocks with explosions.

EXT. TOBRUK DOCKSIDE. DAY

A GERMAN TROOP CARRIER rumbles forward passing a line of
BEDRAGGLED BRITISH POWS as they’re marched along the side of
the harbour;passing a dock in which the mangled carcasses of
boats send up plumes of ugly smoke.

EXT. TOBRUK SQUARE. DAY

A crowd of Tobruk CIVILIANS - French and Italians among the
MOSTLY ARAB FACES. Their papers are being thoroughly checked by
officers sitting at open desks. In a line, wearing his shabby
suit, is CARAVAGGIO. AN ARAB WOMAN in front of him is arguing
over the identity of her ominous CAUCASIAN-LOOKING BABY. An
INTERPRETER mediates. The OFFICER doesn’t believe the woman.
She's getting frantic at the possibility of losing her child.

Suddenly there’s a disturbance as a WOMAN is dragged along the
line by her hair. She's bloodied, and has been tortured, and
it’s hard to recognize her as the pretty AICHA. She is forced
to consider some horrified members of the line, shakes her

66
CONTINUED

head, moans, falls to her feet. Caravaggio doesn’t look, stares
straight ahead. An officer watches him as he turns briefly and
helplessly out of concern for her. Their eyes catch for an
instant and the officer sees it.

Caravaggio slowly walks away from the line. A soldier shouts to
halt, the crowd ducks for cover. Caravaggio puts up his arms in
surrender.

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM, TOBRUK. DAY

Caravaggio is slumped at a table, HIS HANDS MANACLED TO ITS
THICK WOODEN LEGS. There’s A TELEPHONE at another table in the
corner of the room attended by a CLERK with A STENOGRAPHER
working next to him. The room has stone walls which appear
damp, and no windows. SOLDIERS stand guard at the door. It’s a
horrible room. Caravaggio is trying to sleep, he’s unshaven and
pasty-looking. His interrogator, MULLER, seems incredibly tired
and aggravated. He approaches the table carrying a collection
of photographs which he lays down on the table in front of
Caravaggio.

MULLER
David Caravaggio.

CARAVAGGIO
No.

MULLER

(of the photographs)
This was taken in Cairo at
British Headquarters - July
+41. And so was this - August
*41. And this - February ‘42.

CARAVAGGIO
It’s possible. I was buying
or selling something. I've
been to Cairo many times.

MULLER
You are a Canadian spy
working for the Allies. Code
name Moose.

THE PHONE rings again, is answered. The Clerk calls to Muller
who gets up, irritably. Caravaggio addresses the room.

CARAVAGGIO
Could you get me a doctor? I'm
sick, I’m leaking blood.

Nobody responds. Muller is irascible on the phone, checking his
watch, negotiating time. The call finishes.

67
CONTINUED

CLERK
(in German)
He’s asking for a doctor.

MULLER
(to Caravaggio)
You want a doctor?

CARAVAGGIO
I've been asking for weeks,
months, I don’t know -

MULLER
We don't have a doctor, but we
do have a nurse.

CARAVAGGIO
(taken aback)
A nurse? Well, sure, great. A
nurse would be great. A
nurse? Great.

Muller nods at the Clerk, who instantly gets up. Just then the
telephone rings again. He hesitates.

MULLER
(in German)
Leave it and get the nurse!

The Clerk exits.

MULLER

(turns to Caravaggio)
Look - give me something. A
name. A code. So we can all
get out of this room.

(wiping his face)
I’m sick of this heat. It’s
too hot.

CARAVAGGIO
I slept with a girl. I’ve got
a wife in Tripoli. A girl
comes up and points at you,
you only see trouble.

The NURSE comes in. She is Arab, unbearably young, pure. Her
head is covered.

MULLER
I‘11 tell you what I’m going
to do. This is your nurse, by
the way. She’s Moslem, so
she’1ll understand all of
this. What’s the punishment
for adultery? Let’s leave it
CONTINUED

MULLER (cont ‘d)
at that. You‘re married and
you were fucking another
woman, so that’s - is it the
hands that are cut off? Or is
that for stealing? Does
anyone know?

There’s a silence. Muller turns to Caravaggio.

MULLER
Well, you must know. You were
brought up in Libya, yes?

CARAVAGGIO
Don’t cut me.

MULLER
Or was it Toronto?

Now the phone starts again. The CLERK picks it up, there’s a
terse exchange, he puts the receiver on the desk, waits for the
moment to interrupt Muller.

MULLER
Ten fingers. How about this?
You give me a name for every
finger - doesn’t matter who.
I get something, you keep
something. I'm trying to be
reasonable.

CARAVAGGIO
(ashen)
Don’t cut me. Come on.

MULLER
(pauses, suddenly
puzzled)

Are thumbs fingers?
{in GERMAN to the
others)

Is a thumb a finger?

No response. Muller opens his palms to Caravaggio.

MULLER
I get no help from these
people.

Muller slams down the telephone receiver. An AIR RAID SIREN is
going off somewhere, and now the faint sound of explosions is
also discernable, but all muffled in this room along with the
steady tap-tap of the STENOGRAPHER. At ‘that moment, Muller
suddenly becomes aware of what is happening. He turns on the
Stenographer.

69
CONTINUED

MULLER
(in German)
What are you doing?

STENOGRAPHER
(awkward, in German)
The Geneva Convention. I’m -

Muller peremptorily rips out the paper, throws it on the floor.

MULLER

The Geneva Convention! Ach!
CARAVAGGIO

Hey - Come on! You can’t do

that!

DURING THIS Muller's gone to the table, pulled out a drawer,
and produced A CUT-THROAT RAZOR. He hands it to the Nurse,
makes a line across his own left thumb and jerks his head
towards Caravaggio. The Nurse is extremely reluctant. Muller
claps his hands, pushes her towards Caravaggio.

MULLER
Go! Hey! Gol

Caravaggio is in terror.

CARAVAGGIO
I'll give you names. I’1l
give you names. What names
did you say? I’ve forgotten
the names. Tell me the names
and I’1l agree.

The guards come away from the door and press down on
Caravaggio’s shoulders to prevent him from moving. The Nurse,
grim-faced, approaches, kneels at the table, takes the blade
from Muller, takes gentle hold of Caravaggio’s hand.

CARAVAGGIO
{as she prepares to
cut)
Please - please - oh please -
oh please - I promise. What
name did you say? I knew them!

MULLER
(jabbing at the Nurse)
Come on!

And then Caravaggio SCREAMS AND SCREAMS. The AIR RAID is
continuing outside, the PHONE IS RINGING. Muller watches as
Caravaggio is mutilated, his cries continuing, his whimpers
horrible.

70
INT. THE PATIENT’S ROOM. NIGHT.

Caravaggio, his hands revealed, thumbless, advances on The
Patient, his cries still ringing in the room.

CARAVAGGIO
{The man who took my thumbs, I
found him eventually - I
killed him. The man who took
my photograph, I found him
too - that took me a year.
He’s dead. Another man helped
get that man across the
desert to Cairo. I’ve been
leoking for him.

INT. LIBRARY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF EGYPTOLOGY. DAY

Madox and Almasy are camped in one corner of THE LIBRARY,
hunched over their maps and papers and journals and clashing
furiously over the site of the next part of the expedition.

MADOX
(pushing away his
charts)
You can’t get through there.

ALMASY

I was looking again at Bell's
maps. If we can find a way to
cross the wadi we can drive
straight up into Cairo...

(he points at a map)
- and this whole spur is a
real possibility...

MADOX
So - on Thursday you don’t
trust Bell’s map - “Bell was a
fool, Bell couldn’t draw a
map” - but on Friday he’s
suddenly infallible?

Almasy is surprised by Madox’s anger.

MADOX
And where are the Expedition
Maps?

ALMASY

In my room.

MADOX
Those maps belong to His
Majesty’s Government. They
shouldn't be left lying

71
CONTINUED

MADOX (cont‘d)
around for any Tom, Dick or
Harry to have sight of.

ALMASY
What on earth's the matter
with you?

MADOX

Don’t be so bloody naive. You
know there’s a war breaking
out.

(he tosses a slip of

paper onto the map,

recites its message)
This arrived this morning. By
order of the British
Government - all
International Expeditions to
be aborted by May 1939.

EXT. CAIRO SOUK. LATE AFTERNOON

Almasy and Madox walk through the souk, the bars filling up as
the stalls are closing. Both of them are sombre.

ALMASY
What do they care about our
maps?

MADOX

What do we find in the desert?
Arrowheads, spears. In a war,
if you own the desert, you own
North Africa.

ALMASY
(contemptuous )
Own the desert.

Almasy hesitates at a junction, clearly about to take his leave

of Madox.

ALMASY
Madox - that place, that
place at the base of a woman’s
throat? You know, the hollow,
here ~- does it have an
official name?

Madox looks at him.

MADOX
For God's sake, man - pull
yourself together.

72
INT. OPEN-AIR CINEMA, CAIRO. EVENING
The OPEN-AIR CINEMA is just beginning its evening programme.

PATHE NEWS BEGINS and we date the event to April 1939. Stories
of imminent war jostle with images of Merrie England. Village
greens, sporting victories, record sunshine on the Isle of
Wight. Alone among the necking couples - mostly soldiers with
their Egyptian girlfriends - sits Katharine. She’s waiting for
Almasy. Katharine is wretched. She sits, head down, hardly
watching the screen, marooned in her despair about duplicity,
sordid assignations.

Almasy arrives, slides in beside Katharine, his shadow
momentarily large across the screen.

ALMASY
Sorry.

They watch the screen. Katharine is weeping. Almasy doesn’t
understand. He puts his arm around her.

KATHARINE
I ean't do this, I can’t do
this anymore.

INT. OPEN-AIR CINEMA, CAIRO. EVENING

LATER and Katharine and Almasy sit stiffly under the bleachers
while the main feature - a Busby Berkeley revue - plays in the
background. Finally, Katharine gets up.

KATHARINE
I‘d better go now. Say
goodbye here.

ALMASY
I'm not agreeing. Don’t think
I’m agreeing, because I’m
not.

They stand, awkward. Katharine rehearses her position.

KATHARINE
Any minute now, he’1l find
out, we‘ll barge into someone
- it will kill him.

ALMASY
Don't go over it again,
please.

He takes her hands, lays his cheeks into them. She pulls her
hand away as she makes for the exit. He calls after her.

73
CONTINUED

ALMASY
Katharine -

He looks toward her, his smile awful.

ALMASY
I just wanted you to know. I’m
not missing you yet.

She nods, can’t find this funny.

KATHARINE
You will. You will.

She turns sharply from him and BANGS her head against the
bleacher support, staggers at the shock of it, then hurries
away.

INT. THE PATIENT'S ROOM. NIGHT

The patient's stertorous breathing, each intake accompanied by
a small noise, a note, suddenly stops. Then it steadies again.
He appears to be alone. Caravaggio lies under his bed, smoking,
a vigil.

INT. AMBASSADOR’S RESIDENCE, CAIRO, 1939. NIGHT

Last seen at the troops’ Christmas party, the INNER COURTYARD
has been transformed into an elegant outdoor banquet, with a
small band providing entertainment. The Aimasy/Madox team is
assembled for A FAREWELL DINNER. They are waiting for Almasy to
arrive, his seat conspicuously empty. He is very late. And then
he’s there, dangerously drunk, terribly dashing. He practically
dances to his chair which he drags violently away from its
position opposite Katharine. He bows to Lady Hampton.

ALMASY
I believe I’m rather late.

MADOX
(ignoring the drama of
this entrance)
Good, we're all here? A
toast, to the International
Sand Club - may it soon
resurface.

THE OTHERS
The International Sand Club!

ALMASY
(raising his glass)
The International Sand Club!
Misfits, buggers, fascists,
and fools. God bless us,
everyone.

74
CONTINUED

The others drink, trying to ignore his mood.

ALMASY
Oops! Mustn’t say
International. Dirty word.
Filthy word. His Majesty! Die
Fuhrer! Il Duce!

CLIFTON
Sorry, what’s your point?

ALMASY

(not responding)
And the people here don’t
want us. You must be joking.
The Egyptians are desperate
to get rid of the
Colonials...

(to an embarrassed

Fouad)
Isn't that right, Fouad? Some
of their best people down on
their hands and knees begging
to be spared a knighthood...

(to his host, Sir

Hampton)
Isn‘t that right? Isn’t that
right, Sir Ronnie?

Ronnie Hampton shrugs. They’re all very uncomfortable. Almasy
turns to Clifton.

ALMASY

What’s my point?
(standing up)

Oh! I’ve invented a new dance
~ anybody up for it - it’s
called - it’s called - the
Bosphorus Bug. Madox?
Bermann? You'll dance with
me... D’Ag? Come on D’Aggers.

D’‘ AGOSTINO
Let’s eat first. Sit down.

The Band is now playing ‘Manhattan’ Almasy, without missing a
beat, begins to sing, replacing the words with alternatives he
knows. He lurches around. Katharine can’t look at him.

ALMASY
‘4+. We'll bathe at Brighton,
the fish you'll frighten when
you're in - your bathing suit
so thin, will make the
shellfish grin, fin to fin.’
They‘re playing it far too

75
CONTINUED

ALMASY (cont‘d)
slowly, but these were the
words, actually, before they
were cleaned up. Might be a
song for you, Mrs. Clif -

Madox gets up and pulls Almasy into his chair, taking charge.

MADOX
(whispering sharply)
Look, either shut up, or go
home. You're completely
plastered! Now sit down.

ALMASY
(loudly)
Absolutely right, shut up,
shut up. Sorry. I'm so sorry.
I can’t think what came over
me. Lashings of apologies —
all round.

EXT. AMBASSADOR’S RESIDENCE. NIGHT

Later, and now MOST OF THE GROUP ARE DANCING. We see Katharine
dancing with Rupert Douglas, enjoying herself. Bermann is there
and even Madox - jogging and grinning foolishly. Clifton looks
at Katharine who, as the dance ends, excuses herself to go to
the cloakroom. Almasy hovers in the shadows, unseen.

INT. AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE. NIGHT

Katharine comes along the familiar warren of rooms and
corridors and is suddenly confronted by Almasy, tortured and
out of control.

ALMASY
Why were you holding his
collar?

KATHARINE
What?

ALMASY
(mimicking her
inflection)
What? That boy, that little
boy, you were holding his
collar, you were gripping his
collar, what for? Is he next?
You going to drag him into
ur little room? Where is
it? Is this it?

KATHARINE
Don’t do this.

76
CONTINUED

ALMASY

(pressing her against

the wall)
I’ve watched you - I've
watched you at garden
parties, on verandahs, at the
Races - how can you stand
there? How can you ever
smile? As if your life hadn't
capsized?

KATHARINE
You know why. You know why.

He tries to hold her. She resists. They're both in torment.

ALMASY
Dance with me.

KATHARINE
No.

ALMASY
(tracing her shoulder
blade)
Dance with me. I want to touch
you. I want the things which
are mine. Which belong to me.

KATHARINE
(sobbing)
Do you think you’re the only
one who feels anything? Is
that what you think?

INT. THE PATIENT’S ROOM. NIGHT

Hana sits with the patient. His eyes are full of tears. He
opens them, sees her watching over him. He's embarrassed.

THE PATIENT
Why don’t you go? Get some
sleep.

HANA

Would you like me to?
He nods. She gets up from her sewing, then leaves.
INT. THE MONASTERY, LANDING AND STAIRS. NIGHT
Hana leaves the room, then turns and sees a tiny lamp on the
floor. It’s made from a snail shell filled with oil. She bends
to it curiously, then sees & second lamp half-way down the

stairs, then a third further down. She smiles in the light,
then follows the trail.

77
EXT. THE MONASTERY CLOISTERS. NIGHT

In the cloisters the trail of shell lamps continues, like tiny
cat's eyes. As they reach the hopscotch chalk marks, they
outline the squares. Hana hopscotches and then follows the
lights, disappearing around a corner.

INT. THE MONASTERY STABLES. NIGHT

Hana comes through into the stables. The lamps lead her, then
they stop. She peers into the shadows.

KIP (0/5)
Hana

She turns to the voice. He steps out of the darkness.

HANA

(happy)
Kip.

And he goes to her.
EXT. AREZZO. DUSK

Kip, Hana clinging onto him, steers the motorbike in the
deserted PIAZZA. They dismount and walk up to the doors of the
CHURCH.

INT. CHURCH. DUSK

They enter the Church. It’s in almost total darkness. Kip
circles Hana with the rope, MAKING A SLING across her waist and
shoulder. He lights a small flare and hands it to her before
disappearing into the gloom.

Hana stands holding the flare.

Kip runs up a hill of sandbags, right up into the rafters. Be
collects the other end of the rope which is attached to Hana.
Holding on to it, he just STEPS OFF INTO THE DARKNESS.

SIMULTANEOUSLY HANA IS SWUNG UP INTO THE AIR, her startled yelp
echoing around the Church. Kip touches ground, while Hana
swings through space, coming to rest about three feet from the
FRESCOED WALLS, painted by Piero Della Francesca. Hana’s flare
makes a halo around her head.

Now Kip, on the ground, still holding the rope, walks forward
and causes Hana to SWING to the right. She lets out a giddy
laugh, exhilarated and nervous, and she flies, illuminating -
en passant - faces, bodies, angels. Kip guides the rope as if
they were making love, which in a way they are.

78
CONTINUED

Hana arrives, hovering, in front of THE QUEEN OF SHEBA TALKING
TO SOLOMON. She’s overwhelmed. She reaches out to touch the
giant neck of the sad Queen.

INT. KIP’S TENT. NIGET

Hana lies over Kip in the stable, a naked white body plaited
into a brown one.

HANA
If one night I didn’t come to
see you, what would you do?

KIP
I try not to expect you.

HANA
Yes, but if it got late and T
hadn‘t shown up?

KIP
Then I’d think there must be a
reason.

HANA
You wouldn't come to find me?
(Kip shrugs)
That makes me never want to
come here.
(Kip still won’t
respond)
Then I tell myself he spends
all day searching, in the
night he wants to be found.

Then Kip turns, rolling over to face her.
KIP
I do. I do want you to find
me. I do want to be found.
I do.
EXT, THE MONASTERY STABLES. EARLY MORNING

Hardy knocks cautiously on the door of the stables. Eventually
Hana opens the door.

HARDY
Ah, I was looking for
Lieutenant Singh.

HANA
He’s sleeping.

HARDY
Only we've got to go to work.

79
CONTINUED

HANA
I‘ll tell him. What is it? Is
it a mine?

HARDY
It's a bomb. Up by the
Viaduct.

She closes the door, then reappears.

HANA
Does he have to go?

HARDY
Pardon me?

HANA
What if you couldn’t find
him...?
(Hardy's bewildered)
Sergeant, not today, please.
Not this morning.

Kip comes to the door, winding his turban.

KIP
What’s happening? Am I
needed?

HARDY

I’m afraid so, sir.
Kip hurries to his tent. Hana follows him.

HANA
Don’t go. I’m frightened.

KIP
This is what I do. I do this
every day.

EXT. A VIADUCT NORTH OF THE MONASTERY. DAY

Kip is lowered by a pulley into the shaft the sappers have made
around the bomb. Hardy supervises. The bomb’s huge - 2,000
pounds - and protrudes ostrich-like from the pit, its nose sunk
into a pool of sludge at the base of the viaduct.

Kip steps off and sinks knee-deep in mud, grunting in disgust.

Warily, he touches his huge opponent, feeling the condition of
the case. He wipes the metal. Reveals a serial number, calls it
out to Hardy, who’s perched on the bank.

80
CONTINUED

KIP
Serial number - KK-IP2600.

Kip stares at the number. A bomb with his name on it.

HARDY
(noting it down)
KK-IP2600 Sir! I‘11, get the
oxygen.

EXT. ROAD APPROACHING VIADUCT. DAY

Hana cycles along on Caravaggio’s bicycle. A TANK comes roaring
up behind her, then a second and third, loaded up with people -
citizens and soldiers, and children - waving flags and
gesticulating. She lets the metal circus go by.

INT. BOMB SHAFT. DAY

Back in the shaft, Kip works away, his fingers shaking with the
cold from the oxygen he’s using to freeze the fuse. Suddenly
there’s a VIOLENT TREMOR. The ground is SHUDDERING, and Kip’s
tools are falling into the sludge.

KIP
Hardy! What‘s happening?!

EXT. VIADUCT. DAY

The TANKS are rumbling towards the Viaduct. HORNS start
sounding. Hardy, below, bellows at his men above for
explanation.

HARDY
Corporal !?

DADE
(leaning over the
parapet of the
viaduct)
Tanks, sir. Don’t know what
it's about.

HARDY

Stop them!

KIP
Hardy!

HARDY
What is this - a bloody
carnival? Stop them!
KIP
The fuse has snapped!

81
CONTINUED

Two Sappers run across the bridge towards the oncoming
procession. They wave their orange flags, the tanks wave back
with their flags - Stars and Stripes, Union Jacks. Now SHOTS
are ringing out. In the shaft, oblivious, Kip slides out from
under the bomb, the oxygen spurting everywhere, all over his
clothes, hissing on the surface of the water. Hardy bends into
the shaft, heedless of his own safety.

HARDY
You've got to cut, sir, that
frost won’t last.

KIP
Go away.
HARDY
Yessir.
KIP
This is making me incredibly
angry.
HARDY

I know, sir.

Kip rubs his hands to warm them up, locates his needle pliers,
and slips them through the tiny gap. His hand touches the
casing and the freeze BURNS his hand. He jerks back, DROPPING
THE PLIERS into the watery sludge, cursing.

Above them the tanks are rumbling over the bridge, sending
drizzles of dust onto them from the fragile structure. The
cheering continues, oblivious to the crisis below.

Now Kip‘s on his hands and knees in the sludge, trying
frantically to find the pliers. Hardy looks at his watch, he
can't help. The seconds run out as Kip groveis in the mud.

HARDY
Can you feel them?

Then, suddenly Kip emerges with the pliers, soaked, shuddering.
He doesn’t know where to cut.

BARDY
Cut it sir, you‘’ve got to cut
itl

He goes straight to an exposed loop, no finesse, and cuts.
There's a snip. Then nothing.

EXT. VIADUCT. DAY
Kip and Hardy emerge from their ordeal to join what appears to

be a party. There are wine bottles and embraces. They’re
bewildered.

HARDY
Get a blanket!
(not getting
attention)
Spalding - get a blanket for
the Lieutenant!

DADE
It’s over, Sir! It’s over.
Jerry's surrendered.
(to Kip)
Well done, well done, Sir!

And now they're all shaking hands and slapping backs, and the
SOLDIERS FROM THE TANKS are there and the victory celebrations
begin. Kip’s blank, drained, not taking anything in, as Dade
wraps a blanket around his shoulders.

Hana arrives on the bicycle and she and Kip embrace privately
amidst the celebrations. A different kind of victory for them.

INT. THE PATIENT’S ROOM. NIGHT

Thunder breaks over the Monastery. Hana suddenly comes to the
door of the room. She looks mischievous.

HANA
It’s raining.

And then she bursts out laughing.

EXT. THE MONASTERY CLOISTERS. MORNING

A whoop precedes THE HEADLONG RUSH OF KIP, HARDY, and
CARAVAGGIO as they cart The Patient across. the Cloisters like
Manic stretcher-bearers. Hana is with them, checking on The
Patient who bounces uncomfortably. He is nervous, a little
giddy, but laughing. He tries to say something.

CARAVAGGIO
What's he saying?

BANA
He’s saying it’s wonderful.

The rain buckets down as they circle the pond, Hana’s umbrella
threatening to lift her into the air.

INT. THE PATIENT'S ROOM. NIGHT
A VICTORY CELEBRATION PARTY.
The gramophone plays. Kip sits in the window, the shutter open,

the village lit up behind his head, nodding to the music,
sucking out of his condensed milk. Elsewhere there is an open

bottle of cognac, some wine. The Patient has a beaker of wine.
Caravaggio is dancing with Hana.

HANA
Kip - come and dance with us.

KIP
(a sly wobble of the
head)
Later.

HANA
Oh, come on.

The Patient watches, his head nodding to the music.

THE PATIENT
Yeah!

EXT. VILLAGE SQUARE. NIGHT

A tiny PIAZZA where the Sappers and the Villagers are having
their own, more raucous, Victory Feste. There are accordions,
there’s dancing, and there’s HARDY, stripped to some exotic
underpants, clambering up the STATUE OF A FIRST ~ WORLD - WAR
SOLDIER IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FOUNTAIN. It's currently sporting
a German Helmet and Hardy has a British replacement in his
hands. He also has a UNION JACK FLAG between his teeth. He's
extremely drunk and extremely happy.

The rest of the Bomb Squad and the other party-goers roar their
approval.

INT. THE PATIENT'S ROOM. NIGHT
Hana and Caravaggio are still dancing.
There's a muffled thud in the distance. Kip’s ears prick up. He

glances for an instant out of the window.

HANA
(anxious, of the
noise)
What was that?

She is spinning with Caravaggio. When she comes around again,
Kip has gone.

EXT. VILLAGE SQUARE, ITALY 1945. NIGHT

Kip’s motorbike skids into the tiny PIAZZA.

A MILITARY AMBULANCE IS ALREADY THERE. The shattered fountain,
the sluiced flagstones, shining wet and slick, give some clues

as to what's happened, as do the elderly standing in the
shadows, the distressed girls, arm in arm. ONE GIRL, young and

84
CONTINUED

quite striking, is particularly inconsolable, her grief sobbed
out at the doors of the ambulance.

SPALDING salutes Kip, who waves his salute away, just wanting
to know what happened.

SPALDING
Booby trap. Sergeant Hardy
was running up the Union
Jack, sir, up off that statue
- it just went off, sir.

DADE
Sergeant Hardy climbed up,
sir, just for a lark. Should
have been me, it was my idea.

Kip goes to the ambulance. Spalding tries to stop him.

SPALDING
Sir - you don't want to look.

Kip steps into the back of the ambulance, bends over both
bodies, does look, then comes out, past the weeping girl.

KIP
Who‘s that girl?

DADE
His fiancee, sir.

KIP

(confused)

Hardy's?

DADE

He kept it a bit dark.
EXT. THE STABLES. LATE DAY

Hana approaches. Kip is inside the stable, the door latched. He
sits, impassively, still shocked, as Hana tries to make
contact.

HANA

Kip. Kip. It’s me. I’m 80
sorry about what happened.

(no response)
Can I talk to you?

(no response)
Why won’t you talk to me?
I don't understand. Let me
come in.

She kicks at the door in her frustration. Kip doesn’t move,
doesn't appear to hear.

85
CONTINUED

HANA
Please, Kip, please!

Kip doesn’t respond. Hana is at a loss.
INT. PATIENT'S ROOM. EVENING

The Patient listens as Hana comes back into the monastery,
climbs the stone steps to her room. He doesn’t know what's
happening. Feels desperately isolated.

THE PATIENT
Hana? Hana?

INT. HANA’S ROOM. EVENING

Later, and Hana sits in her room, despondent, lost in her
thoughts. Then she is distracted by conversation in The
Patient's room below.

INT. THE PATIENT’S ROOM. NIGHT
The Patient’s eyes open to see Caravaggio at the morphine.

THE PATIENT
Hana tells me you’re leaving.

CARAVAGGIO
(preparing the
injection)

There's going to be trials,
they want me to interpret,
don’t they know I’m allergic
to courtrooms?

He delivers the injection into The Patient’s arm. The Patient
sighs. Caravaggio takes off his jacket. A pistol is stuck in
his waistband, and he places it ominously on the altar. The
Patient sees it.

CARAVAGGIO

So, I come across the
Hospital Convoy -

(holds up the syringe)
- I'm looking for this stuff,
and this nurse, Mary, tells
me about you and Hana, hiding
in some monastery, in -
retreat -

(he administers his

own injection, using

his teeth to grip the

sleeve)
- how you came out of the
Desert and you were burned
and you didn’t remember your

CARAVAGGIO (cont’d)
name but you knew the words to
every song that ever was and
you had one possession - a
copy of Herodotus - and it was
filled with letters and
cuttings and then I knew it
was you.

(he glares at The

Patient)
I saw you writing in that
book. At the Embassy in
Cairo, when I had thumbs and
you had a face and a name.

THE PATIENT
T see.

Upstairs, sitting on her bed, Hana listens with increasing

concern.

CARAVAGGIO
Before you went over to the
Germans, before you got
Rommel’s spy across the
desert and inside British
Headquarters. He took some
pretty good photographs - I
saw mine in that torture room
in Tobruk, so - they made an
impression.

THE PATIENT
I had to get back to the
desert. I made a promise. The
rest meant nothing to me.

CARAVAGGIO
What did you say?

THE PATIENT
The rest meant nothing to me.

CARAVAGGIO

There was a result to what you
did. It wasn’t just another
expedition.

(holds up hands)
It did this. If the British
hadn‘t unearthed that
photographer, thousands of
people could have died.

THE PATIENT

Thousands of people did die,
just different people.

87
CONTINUED

CARAVAGGIO
Yes, like Madox?

THE PATIENT
What?!

CARAVAGGIO

You know he shot himself -
your best friend? When he
found out your were a spy.

THE PATIENT
(appalled)
No. Madox thought I was a spy?
No. No. I was never a spy.

EXT. BASE CAMP AT THE CAVE OF SWIMMERS. 1939. DAY

The Expedition Team is packing up the Base Camp. Madox and
Almasy are walking together towards the plateau where FOUAD, AL
AUF, and others work at the cars.

MADOX
It’s ghastly, it's like a
witch hunt - anybody remotely
foreign is suddenly a spy, 50
watch out.

ALMASY
Right.

MADOX
We didn’t care about
countries. Did we? Brits,
Arabs, Hungarians, Germans.
None of that mattered, did
it? It was something finer
than that.

ALMASY
Yes. It was.

MADOX
When's Clifton picking you
up?

ALMASY |
Tomorrow afternoon. Don’t
worry, I'1l be ready.

MADOX
I‘11l leave the plane in Kufra
Oasis. So if you need
it...hard to know how long
one’s talking about. We might
all be back in a month or two.
CONTINUED

Madox kneels and takes A HANDFUL OF SAND, puts it into his
pocket. Almasy puts out a hand. This is a moment of great
emotional weight for them both, conducted as if nothing were
happening.

MADOX
I have to teach myself not to
read too much into everything.
Comes of too long having to
read so much into hardly
anything at all.

ALMASY
Goodbye, my friend.

They shake hands.

MADOX
(in Arabic)
May God make safety your
companion.

ALMASY
(a tradition)
There is no God.
{smiles)
But I hope someone looks
after you.

Madox clambers up the hill, then remembers something, jabs at
his throat.

MADOX
In case you're still
wondering - this is called
the suprasternal notch.

Almasy nods.

MADOX
Come and visit us in Dorset.
When all this nonsense is
over.
(then shrugs, thick
with feeling)
You’11 never come to Dorset.

Almasy watches Madox leave.
INT. PATIENT’S ROOM. DAY

The Patient is still digesting the news of Madox’s suicide.
Caravaggio is a little surprised at his response.
CONTINUED

CARAVAGGIO
You didn’t know Madox killed
himself? And you didn't kill
the Cliftons?

THE PATIENT
No. No.
(now he is overwhelmed
by the pain of his
memory )
She...she ...
(then suddenly he’s
clear)
Well, maybe I did. Maybe I
did.

Unseen to either of them Hana listens, full of emotion, as the
story unfolds.

EXT. BASE CAMP AT THE CAVE OF SWIMMERS. 1939. DAY

Almasy sits on a ridge transferring map information from his
Herodotus onto a sheet of paper. He looks up at the sound of
Clifton’s approaching Steerman. It passes fast and horribly
close to his head.

THE PATIENT (0/S)
I was packing up the Base Camp
at the Cave of Swimmers.
Clifton had arranged to fly
down from Cairo to collect
me. He flew like a madman, 80
I didn’t take much notice...

Clifton is flying towards the landing strip. From the air it's
possible to make out Almasy scrambling down from the ridge
towards where stones indicate a landing area, carrying the last
of the materials from the Cave of Swimmers.

EXT. BASE CAMP AT THE CAVE OF SWIMMERS. DAY

Almasy watches as the plane drops toward him, shielding his
eyes against the sun. He stoops to gather up his luggage.

Almasy looks up to see the plane swerve, now suddenly HEADING
STRAIGHT TOWARDS HIM. He's completely vulnerable, nowhere to
run. He dives at the ground. THE PLANE SMASHES AGAINST AN
INVISIBLE RIDGE AND TURNS OVER AND OVER, the wings snapping off
like twigs as it hurtles past the prostrate Almasy. He gets to
his feet and starts to run towards the wreckage.

A blue line of smoke is uncoiling from the plane, but no fire.
Almasy pulls away the debris to find GEOFFREY - SLUMPED, NECK
BROKEN, BLOODY. He tries to move him, and in the process
reveals, to his ABSOLUTE horror, KATHARINE, STARING GRIMLY
AHEAD, UNABLE TO MOVE. He's frantic.

90
CONTINUED

ALMASY
Katharine! Oh dear God,
Katharine - what are you
doing here?

KATHARINE
(eyes rolling, an
incredible weariness)
I can’t get out. I can’t move.

Almasy starts to pull at the wreck around her. DURING THIS -

KATHARINE

‘A surprise’ he said.

(she can hardly talk)
Poor Geoffrey. He knew. He
must have known all the time.
He was shouting - “I love you,
Katharine, I love you 80
much.” Is he badly hurt?

ALMASY
I have to get you out.

Almasy pute his arms around Katharine to try and pull her
clear. She can‘t stand the pain.

KATHARINE
Please don’t move me.

ALMASY
I have to get you out.

KATHARINE
It hurts too much.

ALMASY
(can’t bear to hurt
her) .
I know, darling, I’m sorry.

He pulls - hard - the pain from which causes Katharine to gasp,
then pass out. He lifts her gently into his arms and carries
her from the danger of the place.

EXT. THE CAVE OF SWIMMERS. DAY

Almasy has WRAPPED KATHARINE IN THE SILK FOLDS OF HER PARACHUTE
and emerges from near the familiar cleft in the rock,
struggling with the exertion of the climb as they approach the
Cave of Swimmers. He has a large water bottle slung around his
neck and a haversack, and is loaded like a pack horse.
Katharine opens her eyes.

91

KATHARINE
(whispering)
Why did you hate me?

ALMASY
What?

KATHARINE
Don't you know you drove
everybody mad?

ALMASY
Shhhh. Don’t talk.

KATHARINE
(gasping)
You speak so many bloody
languages and you never want
to talk.

They stagger on. He suddenly notices a stain of gold at her
neck. It’s saffron, leaking from a silver THIMBLE which hangs
from a black ribbon.

ALMASY
(overwhelmed)
You're wearing the thimble.

KATHARINE
Of course. You idiot. I
always wear it. I’ve always
worn it. I’ve always loved
you.

Almasy CRIES as he walks - huge sobs, no words - convulsed with
the pain of it. They approach the Cave.

INT. CAVE OF SWIMMERS. DAY

Almasy comes through in shadows, carrying Katharine, blocking
out the light that pours into the entrance of the cave. Once
inside, he sets her down incredibly gently, makes a bed of
blankets and the parachute. He turns on his flashlight.

KATHARINE
It’s so cold.

ALMASY
I know. I‘m sorry. I’11 make a
fire.
INT. CAVE OF SWIMMERS. TORCHLIGHT

As he makes the fire, the light sends his shadow flitting
across the walis.

KATHARINE
Did you get Geoffrey from the
plane?

ALMASY
(reluctant)
Yes.

KATHARINE
Thank you.

ALMASY

(as he works)
Listen to me, Katharine.
You’ve broken your ankle and
I'm going to have to try
and bind it. I think you’ve
also broken your wrist - and
maybe some ribs, which is why
it's hurting you to breathe.
I’m going to have to walk to
£1 Taj. Although given ail
the traffic in the desert
these days I’m bound to bump
into one army or another. And
then I‘1l be back and you'll
be fine.

The fire is lit and he comes over to her, kneels beside her.

KATHARINE
Do you promise? I wouldn't
want to die here. I don’t
want to die in the desert.
I’ve always had rather an
elaborate funeral in mind,
with particular hymns. Very
English. And I know exactly
where I want to be buried. In
our garden. Where I grew up.
With a view of the sea. So
promise me you’11 come back
for me.

ALMASY
I promise I’11 come back. I
promise I'll never leave you.
Now, you have plenty of water
and food.

He kisses her tenderly. Pulls out his HERODOTUS and lays it
beside her. Then he puts down the FLASHLIGHT.

93
CONTINUED

ALMASY
And a good read.
(of the flashlight
battery)
Don't waste this.

KATHARINE
Thank you.
(clouds over)
Will you bury Geoffrey? I
know he’s dead.

ALMASY
I'm sorry, Katharine.

KATHARINE
I know.

He's tearing strips from the parachute with his knife.
ALMASY
Every night I cut out my heart
but in the morning it was full
again.
He leans over her, desperately worried for her. She smiles.

KATHARINE
Darling. My darling.

EXT. THE DESERT. DAWN
Almasy’s walking. He’s singing to keep awake. Darktown
Strutter’s Ball. - ’I'11 be down to get you in the taxi,

Almasy continues, his journey taking him through miles of
undulating dunes.

EXT. EL TAJ. DAY

Finally Almasy arrives at the outskirts of El Taj. He staggers

94

towards this ancient Trading Post. A Brtish Sentry watches his
approach with interest.

EXT. SQUARE AT EL TAJ. DAY.

The Sentry, a CORPORAL, brings Almasy into a square. A young
OFFICER sits at a table in the shadows of his office. His STAFF
CAR is parked in the shade.

OFFICER
Good morning!
(the Corporal has a
water bottle, hands it
to Almasy)
So, golly, where have you
come from?

ALMASY

(gulping the water,

trying to summon his

thoughts)
There’s been an accident. I
need a doctor - to come with
me. And I need to borrow this
ear. I’1l pay, of course, and
I need, I need morphine and -

OFFICER

May I see your papers, sir?
ALMASY

What?
OFFICER

If I could just see some form
of identification?

I’m sorry, I’m not making
sense, forgive me, I‘ve been

woman badly injured at
Gilf Kebir, in the Cave of
Swimmers. I am a member of the

have been walking for three
days! I do not want to spell
my name, I want you to give me
this car!

OFFICER

I understand you are agitated
- perhaps if you’d like to
sit down I could radio back to
HQ - ?

ALMASY
(snapping)
No! No! Don’t radio anybody,
just, just give me the
fucking car!

Almasy sets on the Officer, hauling him by the lapels, but then
immediately loses his balance. As he stumbles up he gets the
stock of the Corporal's RIFLE Across his head, KNOCKING HIM TO
THE GROUND.

INT. CAVE OF SWIMMERS. TORCHLIGHT

Katharine has been writing in the Herodotus. The torchlight
FLICKERS as it illuminates some words - ‘Drag myself outside’
is legible, then ‘We die, we die’ - She shakes the torch. It
FLICKERS again. Then goes out. Absolute BLACKNESS. The sound of
her trembling breath, of her terror.

EXT. EL TAJ STREET. DAY

Almasy, head pounding, is in the back of the jeep, chained to
. the tailgate. He’s desperate. The Corporal is driving.

ALMASY
(shouting, hoarse)
Stop the car. Please. A woman

EXT. A TRAIN, THE DESERT. DUSK
A TRAIN scuttles through the desert.
INT. TRAIN, THE DESERT. DUSK

Almasy is HANDCUFFED to the metal grille of the goods
compartment. He’s lying down among a bunch of other prisoners
and their little bundles of possessions in this makeshift cell
- some Arabs, some Italians.

AA SERGEANT pushes a lavatory-bound prisoner along the corridor,
leaving behind A YOUNG PRIVATE who sits on a packing case, with
a rifle across his lap, reading a Penguin edition of Gullivers
Travels. Almasy is in complete despair to be on the train. He
tries to move, but he’s locked tight to the grille. He rattles
the cuffs against the metal.

ALMASY
Excuse me.
(the Soldier looks up)
I also need to use the
lavatory.

SOLDIER
You'll have to wait.

ALMASY
It’s urgent.

the request.

SERGEANT
Go on then - you take him.
I’ve been up and down this
bloody train all day.

INT. TRAIN CORRIDOR, THE DESERT. DAY

The Soldier pushes Almasy along the corridor. They arrive
outside the lavatory. The Soldier is distracted for a split
second. Enough for Almasy to ELBOW HIM savagely in the stomach,
winding him, before battering his with his fists. He wraps his
cuffs around the Soldier’s neck and - yanking them together and
twisting - proceeds to strangle the young soldier.

INT. TRAIN, THE DESERT. EVENING

Almasy clambers over the guardrail and leaps off, tumbling into
the desert sunset.

EXT. RAILWAY TRACK, THE DESERT. EVENING

Almasy, silhouetted against the evening sky, hobbles back down
the track, THREE HUNDRED MILES AWAY from the dying Katharine
Clifton, no way now of saving her. He is a tiny speck in the
vast desert. His heart broken. He sinks to his knees in
despair.

INT. THE PATIENT’S ROOM. NIGHT

The Patient is exhausted. He has said aloud what has tortured
him. His failure to save Katharine. He looks at Caravaggio.

THE PATIENT
So yes. She died because of
me. Because I loved her.
Because I had the wrong name.

CARAVAGGIO
And you never got back to the
cave?
EXT. KUFRA OASIS. DAY
Almasy is uncovering the tarpaulin which has been protecting

Madox’s TIGER MOTH. Around him are German soldiers, two of whom

the British made me their
enemy, I gave their enemy our
maps.

Almasy carries a mapcase and hands it over to the German
officer, who salutes him and walks toward his car. Almasy turns
to the plane, rips off a sign Madox has pinned to a wing. It
reads SEE YOU IN DORSET.

THE PATIENT (0/S)
So I got back to the desert
and to Katharine in Madox‘s
English plane with German
gasoline. When I arrived in
Italy, on my medical chart,
they wrote ‘English Patient’
Isn’t that funny, after all
that I became English.

KATHARINE’S CORPSE lies where he left her - a ghost on a bed of
silk and blankets. The chill of the cave has preserved her. She
could be asleep.

He sobs, whispering to her. He's terribly cold, exhausted. He
slips underneath the covers to be next to her, and closes his
eyes.

INT. THE PATIENT'S ROOM. MORNING

Hana sits with the English Patient - the room shuttered against
the morning light. His breathing is noticeably worsening,a

violently. The Patient’s expression is full of peace.

THE PATIENT
Read to me, will you? Read me
to sleep.

INT. THE PATIENT'S ROOM. DAY

Hana lies beside The English Patient. She has the Herodotus and
is reading to him from the passage Katharine had written as she
waited for him in the Cave of Swimmers.

HANA
(reading)
‘My darling, I’m waiting for
you. How long is a day in the
dark? or a week? The fire is
gone now and I’m horribly
cold.’

The reading continues, but sometimes it's Katharine’s own voice
that’s heard.

HANA
‘I really ought to drag
myself outside - but then
there would be the sun. I’m
afraid I waste the light on
the paintings and on writing
these words. We die, we die
rich with lovers and tribes,
tastes we have swallowed...
bodies we have entered and
swum up like rivers, fears we
have hidden in like this
wretched cave...’

INT. THE CAVE OF SWIMMERS. TORCHLIGHT

Almasy smudges Katharine’s pale face with saffron from the
thimble. He presses his cheek to hers, smoothes her hair, with
incredible tenderness.

KATHARINE (0/S)
«..I want all this marked on
my body. We are the real
countries, not the boundaries
drawn on maps with the names
of powerful men...

EXT. CAVE OF SWIMMERS. DAY

Almasy comes out of the cave, carrying the bundle of Katharine
in his arms, wrapped in the silks of her parachute. He's
shuddering in the throes of his grief, but there’s no sound.

KATHARINE (0/5)
«e. I know you will come and
carry me out into the palace
of winds...That's all I’ve
wanted - to walk in such a
place with you, with friends,
an earth without maps.

INT. THE PATIENT’S ROOM. DAY
The Patient is slipping away a8 Hana reads the last of
Katharine’s message.
HANA
‘The lamp’s gone out...and
I'm writing in the darkness.‘

She looks up from the book. His eyes roll, his preathing
quiets, then stops.

EXT. LANE OUTSIDE THE MONASTERY GARDEN. DAY

Caravaggio is at the gate to the Monastery. A TRUCK isp waiting
with him. A family sits in the back of the truck. Caravaggio
stands with a young woman. He shouts into the garden.

CARAVAGGIO
Hana!

INT. THE PATIENT'S ROOM. DAY

Hana lingers in the empty room. fhe mattress stripped bare. No

pedside cabinet, and scoops it up.

EXT. LANE OUTSIDE MONASTERY GARDEN. DAY

the woman driver, Gioia. She and Caravaggio amile like lovers.

HANA
Buon giorno.

CARAVAGGIO
She‘1l take you as far as
Florence.

HANA
I can get in the back.

And she clambers Up, sits down between the children. They
exchange some small stiff, shy smiles, and then the truck
bounces away. Hana takes one final look at the Monastery as it
disappears around the bend and then turns and confronts the

life insisting noisily in the truck.

INT. TIGER MOTH. DAY

INSIDE THE COCKPIT : {HE COUPLE AS AT THE FRONT OF THE FILM.
Almasy, obliterated by goggles and helmet, Katharine ahead of
him, slumped forward as if sleeping.

The plane banks over the dark ravines of the Gilf Kebir, and
then suddenly, the rocks have gone, giving way to the earth
without maps - the desert - stretching out for mile after mile.
Almasy, the English Patient, looks down on it.
