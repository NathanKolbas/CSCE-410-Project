INT. EL CAMINO - DAY”

Marine Captain BOB HAYNE leans on his horn as he cuts in
and out of traffic. Bob wears a dress uniform with a
black armband, his wife, SALLY, is in black with a veil.
Both are slightly tight. In their early thirties, they
are known as 2 fun couple, the Sonny and Cher of the
Officers’ Club. Sally sniffs, points to a red light on
the dashboard.

: BOB
Goddamn fanbelt...
EXT. FREEWAY OFFRAMP - DAY

The El Camino slices through traffic toward an exit.

EXT. SERVICE STATION/SMALL GROCERY - DAY

Sally comes out of the grocery store with a sixpack of
beer and a wad of paper towels, crosses to the El Camino,
where Bob is finishing up with the fanbelt. She gives
him the towels, opens them both a can of beer. Bob's
face and uniform are smeared with grease.

BOB

Shit. But shit...

As the bugler sounds tape, we SEE: Bob, still smudged
with grease, seated next to his mother, AMANDA HAYNE.
Beside his mother is GRANDMOTHER HAYNE, senile and obli-
vious to the goings on. Sally stands behind Bob, and sur-
rounding her are aging Naval.Officers, all in dress
uniforms. A few civilians ere among the mourners. The
empty sleeve of a one-armed captain is flipped from his
pocket by the wind and waves in the face of Grandmother
Hayne, she doesn't react, continues to stare into space.
A grizzled CHIEF ‘PETTY OFFICER retired, with blue
weathered skin, cries unashamedly. Limousine drivers.

Why were you so late?

Before Bob can answer, the grizzled C.P.O. throws an arm
around his shoulder...

C.P.0.

(jabbing at Bob's

greasy uniform)
Look at yourself, goddamit, you
know what your old man would have
_ Said? You're out of uniform, sailor.
Yessir, his own son or not, he'd of
had your ass, kid, he'd of run you
up a flagpole and shoved it in. I
love that old son-of-a-seacock. .
Make him proud of you, Robbie, you

Sally has been watching Bob carefully for signs of danger.
She takes his arm.

SALLY

Leatherneck, roughneck. Jack was

to be prompt. .

BOB
Oh, shit.

AMANDA
He never spoke 2 coarse word or
smoked 2 cigar in my presence. An
Annapolis gentleman.

BOB
Not today...

As they approach a waiting limousine, the news program is

turned off.

Amanda squeezes Sally's hand.

AMANDA
Don't let him do anything dumb,
honey. You know how they are. He
doesn't have to go, you know, the
only son of a Navy widow. And I
still have a few connections, if
it comes to that. It's up to you,
now. Take good care of him, he's
all I've got left...

Sally sits close to him.

BOB :
I'll tell you what she does, she
drives me crazy! I can't take
being around her...

. SALLY
».» Oh, I think Amanda's just old
and lonely... And she's worried,
she's afraid you'll go to Nam...
She really cares about you.

BOB
Bullshit, she cares about herself.

SALLY
(moving closer)
Well, I'care about you.

BOB
How much?
SALLY
(rubs his leg)
A lot...
BOB
Are you worried?
SALLY
No... You'll do whatever's best.

SALLY

He turns and kisses her. She puts a hand on the steering
wheel, keeping the El Camino on course. .

8 INT. BAR - NIGHT

A JUKEBOX competes with the TV war news at one end of the
bar. Bob and Sally are the only ones dancing -- with
drunken abandon, late fifties style -- with more anger
than joy. The music ends and Sally guides Bob to their
pooth. They sit, Bob looks at their empty pitcher of
beer, then rises...

CONTINUED:

BOB
I'll get us a refill, don't go
away...

Sally, out of breath, smiles as Bob takes the pitcher to
the bar. She turns, looks up at a YOUNG SERVICEMAN in
ecivies, leaning on the booth, drinking beer from a bottle,

watching TV.

: SALLY
What's the news?

YOUNG SERVICEMAN
Still fighting, I guess...

Bob turns from the bar to see him talking to Sally. Bob
explodes across the room, swings the man away from the
booth and knocks him across the dance floor. The man
comes up swinging the beer bottle. His companions ere in
front of him immediately. Sally is.on her feet, clutching
Bob's arn.

SALLY
Hey, if you want to rassle, big
boy... .
(nuzzles his ear) -
Let's get out of here.

BOB
(drunk and pissed off)
That little punk...

SALLY
C'mon, gimme the keys. I'll drive...

BOB
Forget it...

She pulls Bob out of the tavern.

A Marine M.P. sergeant snaps to attention and salutes as
Bob drives through the gate.

INT. BASE HOUSE ~ NIGHT

The interior of the house is little more than a motel,
despite Sally's efforts at individuality. Sally enters
first, followed by Bob. As soon as he closes the door,
Sally leaps on him, grabbing Bob around the neck, tries
to wrestle him to the floor. He easily lifts her off her
feet, stumbles across the room and falls with her onto
the couch...

. SALLY :
Bastardt . .

BOB
Bitch!

They roll off to the floor. The grappling begins in half-
earnest. Sally resists furiously, enjoys it but is on

the verge of real pain and outrage. Bob, finding a release
for his anger, struggles to contain Sally, stopping short
of actually hurting her. The sexuality increases as the
violence continues until Sally, exhausted and outmatched,
Surrenders to Bob. The mock rape is over, they begin to
make love. : .

INT. BASE HOUSE BEDROOM - NIGHT . .
Sally sleeping, wakes up as she hears a CRASH from th-

other room. She looks around, sees Bob is not *: bed,

SALLY

SALLY

BOB

Oh, another thing -- get that

SALLY
Okay... It was hysterical in the Px

BOB
C’mon, Dink... .
Dink breaks from the clinch with his girl, VI, follows Bob
onto the bus. Sally looks after Bob for a beat, then
turns away quickly and gets into the car. She makes an
awkward start, a U-turn and drives away.

INT. BASE EOUSE KITCHEN ~ NIGHT

Sally dials telephone. Moves to the refrigerator, makes
vodka over ice es she talks.

SALLY
Hello, “pmanda, it's Sally. Well,
turn it off, I have something to
tell you... It's about Bob, we
couldn't let you know because of
security, but... that's right, he's
gone...,No, he couldn't have called
you -= no way. Amanda, you're
acting like a child... I won't -
listen to that, you listen... you’re
@runk... I'll talk to you when
you're sober.

Sally hangs up, drains her drink and pours another. The

Amanda.

Earl gives Cathy a look.

SALLY
(hiding disappointment)
Oh, I'm sorry, sure, maybe I could
drop in later after you get them
to bed. We could have a drink and
talk about it... Hey, Cathy, no
sweat. Make it tomorrow.

Sally breaks the connection, dials again. The first call

is busy. The second doesn’t answer. She dials again, the
first number 1s still busy. She hangs up and sits staring
at the television hypnotically. The PHONE starts to RING.

Startled, she refuses to answer. She tries to escape into
the bedroom: .

INT. BASE HOUSE BEDROOM - EVENING

The SOUND of the PHONE follows Sally. She stands in the
middie of the room, for the moment totally engulfed by the
evidence of Bob's absence... discarded clothing ~~ empty
drawers open -- a damp towel over the tub -- an open tube
of toothpaste -- naked hangers in a dark closet -- twisted
Sheets and pillows still marked by the imprint of sleep...
then the phone stops ringing and Sally returns to the
living room.

INT. BASE HOUSE LIVING ROOM - EVENING

Sally closes the bedroom door and takes the phone off the
hook. She finds her drink, sits in front of the TV, try-~
ing to follow the soundless image. She takes a sip, sud-
@enly aware of the burning of the alcohol. She sets the
drink on a table, covers her face with her hands, and

begins to cry. The sobbing bulids as Sally yields to her
sadness. :

INT. BASE HOUSE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Sally in the chair asleep. She wakens, startled by the
SOUND of the DOORBELL. She looks at herself in the mirror,
straishtens her heir with her fingers, hides the drink
behind the picture of Bob, then.turns...

. SALLY
Who's there?

VI (0.S8.)
I got a message from Bob!

Sally opens the door to Viola Munson, a pretty, tough,
brassy kid from New Jersey. While she speaks, Vi sizes up
Sally and the house.

VE
I'm Vi... I was at the bus with

Dink.

SALLY
Oh. Right. Sure. Want a drink?
A beer?

vI

No, they're waiting. The take-off's
been delayed and the boys want
company. .Dink asked me to tell

you. I guess your phone’s been

busy.
SALLY
I'took it off the hook.
vr

Got a sixpack? They want a sixpack
and a pizza.

Sally hurries to the kitchen for the beer. Vi peeks into
the bedroom, raps on the wall, notices Sally’s hidden
Qrink. She turns as Sally returns with the beer.

convenient than town... Let's GO.-.

Vi takes a last look around the house as they leave.

EXT. AIR TERMINAL - NIGHT

The El Camino is parked behind Vi's VW van. Bob, his head
on Saliy's shoulder, admires his gift from her, a wedding

band.

BOB
(holds up hand)
Looks pretty damn fancy.

. SALLY
I love it... But you'il probably
take it off when you go on liberty.

BOB
Bullshit. I won't take it off...
Look, I'll be able to send you
whatever you need. I've got good
feelings about this. I think those
gooks shot their wad with this TET

-Offensive. It's a mopping-up

operation from here on out. I aim
to come back a Major, maybe a
Lieutenant Colonel and buy us a
little old place on the beach with

“a Porsche in the garage, y'’hear?

SALLY

They both look up as the rear door of Vi's van opens: un-
expectedly. Vi and Dink, disheveled, crawl out, cross
toward the terminal building...

. BOB .
(watching them)
Of course, if I came back as a
Sergeant, we could do whatever we
felt. like...

SALLY
(holds him close)
Just come back... okay?

BOB

opens door)
Goddam right...

Are you going to call Amanda?
SALLY
Already did.

I couldn't reach her... I’ll try
again.
BOB

Okey... See you,
Sally reaches for Bob, hugs him tightly.

EXT. AIR TERMINAL - NIGHT

The last of the Marines are loaded aboard the transport.
Vi stands with several other wives or girlfriends of en-
listed men, mostly black or Chicano. Sally stands
slightly apart at the fence, less because of snobbery
than shyness. As the plane takes off, the group stands
watching the lights disappear, then breaks up and starts
toward the parked cars. Vi nods. to Sally in passing.

VI
See you around, babe.

Sally smiles, watching Vi pass, then suddenly takes the
Plunge, half-running after Vi.

You don't have to. It’s okay.

Doesn't interest me.

SALLY
I don't care where. I just don't
want to go back to that house for
a while.

. VI
The Shanty might be open, but it's
a little raunchy this time of night...

Sally, on the verge of tears, tries to make a funny face
up at Vi but her voice doesn’t carry over the sound of
loud ROCK from the’ RADIO.

SALLY
I guess that's that.

The van pulls into the garage of a modest shingled house .
circa 1929. Vi turns down the RADIO and yells:

VI

Park in that garage. ‘The © place in
front's empty.

Sally parks as Vi flips a porch light on and goes into
her apartment.

INT. VI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Vi turns on the overhead light as she enters. She crosses,
turns on TV, tries to smooth over the unmade bed, gives up
as she notices how messy the rest of tne apartment is. A
framed picture of Dink sits on an end table, and tacked

te one wall are snapshots of a slim, sensitive young man
with long blonde hair and a wisp of a beard, the opposite
of Dink. Sally enters es the TV suddenly BLARES; the end
of 2 prayer leading into the Star Spangled Banner over
patriotic images as the station signs off the air. Vi

turns: sharply to switch channels.

vi
Shit...

SALLY
Don't!

Vi waits, watching Sally curiously as she stands silent,
her eyes tearing as she listens to the end of the anthem.

When Bob goes, I have to move

INT. SPINAL CORD WARD, VA HOSPITAL — DAY

The ward is divided by screens and curtains into a series
of four bed cubicles, facing each other across the aisle.
A central PA SYSTEM PLAYS MUZAK to the captive audience,
interrupted occasionally for hospital announcements. A

LUKE

He awkwardly removes the bag from the catheter tube, holds

one of the canes and the bag in the same hand, and exits
the ward.

INT. HALLWAY - SPINAL CORD WARD - DAY

Luke comes into the hallway on the gurney, almost hitting
Sally as she walks by. She stumbles to avoid him, knock-~
ing the cane and the bag from his hand, urine splattering
on the floor.

SALLY
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't see you...

Sally instinctively bends down to pick up the cane; she
hesitates when she sees the bag. Sally rises, looks at
Luke. Their eyes meet for en instant, sharing the em-
barrassment.

LUKE
(begins to sob)
Oh, shit...

He cries in his own rage as he swings his remaining cane,
smashing a cart of medications, a tray of juice. Sally,

Sally and Vi carry the last load from the van into a small
house around the corner from Vi's.

INT, BEACH HOUSE - EVENING

The room is piled with Sally's belongings. The furniture
is old and comfortable, arranged around a large rustic
fireplace. Other renters have added an over-sized bean-
bas, psychedelic lights and other trendy touches. Sally
is unpacking files and books, sipping on a beer. Vi is
curled up near the hearth, rolling a joint. . The war news

lays on TV,-silent images against a record of the Stones

INT. PRIVATE ROOM = NIGHT

Luke is partially conscious, twisted awkwardly into the
bedcovers, haif on his side. He frees one arm with dif-
ficulty, raises his head and looks around, disoriented.
The room is dark. He whispers toward the right.

LUKE
Bozo?

There is no response,. Luke finds a button and rings for
the nurse, struggling to turn to his left.

. LUKE -
Virgil?

Again no answer. Luke lies still for a moment, then jerks
the covers from his body. He falds the bottom sheet over
himself lengthwise, tugging carefully in an attempt to
lift the dead weight of his legs and roll them over. He's
sweating with the exertion, panting, fighting an over-
whelming desire to sleep. Suddenly, his body goes off the
edge of the bed. He grabs onta the sheet, trying to slow
his fall. His head strikes a bedside stand, spilling the
water jug, paper cups, a note pad and a ballpoint pen.

“His legs stay on the bed, caught in the sheets, as his

torso hangs to the floor. The lights come on. An aide,
JASON, enters. Luke looks up, wild-eyed.

LUKE.
Don't you touch me!

He takes the ballpoint pen suddenly and places it point up
between his ribs, directly under his heart, supporting
himself in a push-up position, holding the pen upright
between his chest and the floor.

LUKE

really give a shit. You're already
killing me.

under the sheets and ralses the sides of the bed.

Superslope's head turns 180 degrees to watch Sally walk
away, then turns back to look at Hiram's cards.

Luke lies on his back, his arms immobilized by a white
hospital restraining jacket. Pee Wee is trying to feed

We FOLLOW Sally into the room and REVEAL paras, quads and
amputees jammed against the wall, waiting for treatments
in the therapy pool. The pool is also crowded. ‘Two
therapists are in cherge, one operating the hoist which
raises and lowers quads, the other in trunks, working in
the knee-deep water. Sally wheels Denny to the end of
one line, circles the pool to head for an aging man on

a@ gurney who waits to be returned to the ward. She slows
as she nears Luke, in the pool with Virgil. At the side
in line, are Bozo, Dewey, Hiram and Pepe. Bozo is talking
with an amputee from Nam, GORDON. .

BOZO
It shows they don't respect me,
sticking me in lines -- they just
don't give a damn...

GORDON
Don't give me that shit, you waited
in line in the fucking Army!

BOZO
Why don't they put in another pool?

Sally stops to listen, standing in front of Superslope,
slouched alone and silent against the tile wall.

GORDON
Christ, they don't have that kind
of money.

DEWEY
They had it for air strikes I
called in!

GORDON
That's the military, not the VA,
Jesus!

LUKE

Some fucking budget. It's a matter
of priorities...

GORDON
Are you sure?

LUKE
Hell yes -~ the military lays
pressure down for anything they -
want, but we're about as much use
to them as a burned-out tank...

HIRAM

That's bullshit, Martin, you goddam
whiner! You meke me sick.

LUKE
Meybe so, Pop, but you're from a
different war. You know, I haven't

SALLY

help, or if there's anything we

wanted.,. That would meke a difference.

EXT. VA HOSPITAL GROUNDS ~ DAY

A hand-painted sign is stretched above the entrance to the
Veteran's Administration reading JULY FOURTH HANDICAPPED
OLYMPICS = PUBLIC WELCOME. The CAMERA FOLLOWS a car as it
drives through the entrance, REVEALING as we go; picnic
benches lined up next to a "Jack-In-The-Box" hamburger
catering set-up, a patriotically decorated speaker's
stand, empty except for a microphone, a "Good Humor" ice
cream truck, and a wheelchair football game that is in
progress. As the car makes a U-turn, we SEE that most all
of the spectators strung along the sidelines of the field
are patients, many of whom watch from gurneys and wheel-
chairs. A few of the patient's families are present, even
fewer of the hospitel staff. The car makes its way back
to the speaker's stand. A couple in their sixties get out,
the mean wearing en American Legion hat and jacket. They

filled with gold plastic trophies and set them on the

stroll back to watch the football game.

garb, others in football jerseys, others in tee shirts.
Luke 4s playing halfback on the FREEWHEELERS, a team that
includes Bozo, Pepe, Dewey and others we can recognize

SCENES 60-62 JULY FOURTH PICNIC
1/21/77

Harris is on the speaker's stand, a table lined with
trophies beside him. His wife, MARGE, sits to the rear.

HARRIS
Before I announce any of our upcoming
events, I just want to express my thanks
to those hoys that played football --
that was a heckuva game! You talk about
your American spirit, a show of grit and
determination, I saw it all out there on
that field this afternoon. To me, there
is no better way to celebrate our Nation's
independence than through the courage of
you young men. Also, I'd like to thank
the Veteran's Administration for giving
us this day, and for providing us with
2 schedule of non-stop competition. We'll
be starting off with the track and field
events, and any of you boys that are
interested in competing, you just run’ down
Pat Miller, he'll sign you up. I do want to
caution you all to steer clear of the
javelin, discus and shot put areas, keep
your eyes open and practice ‘safety first.'

(he turns) .
Marge, do you have the program? .

(she rises, hands it to him)
Thank you. Later in the day, Marge will
be conducting the old Bingo game, you *on't
want to miss that:

(reads program, Marge leaves stand)
After the.field events, we'll have the
wheelchair slalom, six volts. Directly
following thet, we'll have the grand
slalom, and that, friends, will be the
big one, twelve volts?

I want you all to be sure and drop by
the weight lifting competition, I think
you'll be astounded at what some of these
youngsters can do.
We'll have the finals coming up very soon
in the archery tournement, and, from what
I've seen, we've got a flock of Robin Hoods
on hand today, believe me.

Aha! Gordon Dickson is challenging all

we had them on the schedule, and I'm sorry

to disappoint you, but the boys in blue

Before we hand out the trophies for the
athletic’ contests, I want to announce the
winner in the V.A. Hospital's Essay Contest.
The men were given the subject, ‘What July .
Fourth Means To Me’, and asked to express
theiz thoughts in essay form. Well, let me
tell you, I spent a few sleepless nights
before I could come up with a winner, they
were all just first-rate, but, I finally

had to settle on a doozie, by none other than
Willie Mason!

Come on up here, Willie: Darn it,
you're the winner!

Get on up here! I'm not going to read it!
Yes sir: Willie Malone's essay on ‘What

July Fourth Means To Me‘ takes first place
and you're going to hear it straight from Willie!
WILLIE MALONE'S SPEECH
SCENE 62 - 1/20/77

WILLIE ’

"What July Fourth means to me.'

I guess the first thing I remember

was when I was a kid -- my folks would

take us all down to the park. The whole

town would turn out. That was a little

place in Eastern Oregon called Baker.

It used to be a pretty busy town back

then., did a lot of gold mining and
jumbering. My father was a rancher. It

isn't much now, the mines have closed

and the trees ain't what they used to

be, but I remember it like it was.

Seems like my mother spent days cooking

for the picnic, and around about July -
first,-my’pa's mind would start wanderin'

and he wouldn't give a damn about the

cattle, That got us kids pretty excited,
lookin' forward to all that food and

the skyrockets and all. At the park, they'd
have flags flyin' and games of chance,
kissing booths and wrestling matches.

But let me tell you, no matter what they

had there to keep me busy, that day was
always too long for me. I wanted the sun

to go down, ‘cause when it got dark, th.

band would pley the Stars Spangled Bes ner
and the fireworks would start up. 1‘d

just lie back on the grass and watch them things
explode, and I'd start thinkin' about

how brave those men were that fought in

the Revolution. I'd dream about those men,
how they went to war for our freedom. I guess
that's when I decided to be a soldier, lying
in the grass seeing the sky lit up with
those rockets, hearing that music. I enlisted
when I became of age, I served in Europe

in World War 11 and was involved in the
. liberation of dozens of towns. As I passed
through them, as I saw the faces of the people,
I realized I had fulfilled my dream, I had
become one of those men who had gone to war
for freedom. Anyway, I sure wound up doing
what I wanted to, and that's what freedom means,
and that's what July Fourth means to me.

some good. Get a few volunteers.

on her shirt.

LUKE
Even when you're alane, don't you
ever take it off? Just to feel
free? Look at yourself?

Sally rises, her back to Luke, staring out to the sea as
if looking for a breath of fresh air.

LUKE
On a night like this, I think it's
barbarous. Ritual, like women
binding their feet or wearing veils
or shaving their heads, Or corsets.
Or bustles...

Sally reaches an important decision. She suddenly unhooks
the brassiere and knots her shirttails across her ribs,
sharply outlining her breasts, then turns and drops the
brassiere on Luke's lap.

The high spirits that were present in the initial takeover
have faded. The paras are subdued, some sleeping in their
chairs, others just sitting, waiting. Superslope is alone
in his chair as Virgil works, leaning against the wall, with
the forearm crutches and leg braces. Jeffries and MacDonald
sit on the floor. A gin game is broken up near the front
door es they react to Corrine's voice. Bozo and 2 couple of
other men move the desk back.

BOZO . ,

Be right with you, love, just a

Luke wheels to the door, helps with the desk. The door opens
and the men cheer as Corrine enters. Luke goes to the open

Sally and Vi sit drinking in the lounge. A waiter brings
a bottle of champagne in an ice bucket and starts to open
it.

The waiter gestures toward another table, where two well-

EXT. VA HOSPITAL ADMINISTRATION BUILDING - NIGHT

The crowds begin to quiet as the door opens and Luke ap-
pears. TV newsmen and their cameramen fight their way to
the doorway. Luke looks the situation over for a beat,
then starts to read from the sheet of paper.

LUKE

This letter is addressed to...

It's addressed to the Veterans
Administration in Washington, but
we really meant it for all of you

‘Dear Sirs: Conéitions in this
hospital, as weil as many others
across the country, have become

The TV cameras press closer.

LUKE
'Lack of adequate training for the
doctors, the nurses and the
administrators has had a profound
negative effect on the rehabilitation
process. Patient morale is at an all-
time low, as is...

Suddenly, two SECURITY MEN jump up from the crowd and grab

police quickly put up a ring around the crowd to prevent
violence on the outside.

INT. HOTEL SUITE ~ SAN DIEGO (MISSION BAY) - NIGHT |

Business charts and graphs, as well as sales paraphernalia,
are distributed in the suite. The door opens. BRUCE

FRAZIER, older, aggressive, carries Vi exaggeratedly across
the threshold.

BRUCE
Your honeymoon cottage, love.

Sally and TIM SPENCE, teller, younger and more reserved,
laugh as they follow Vi and Bruce into the sulte. The four
are a bit tipsy from alcohol. Bruce puts Vi onto the
couch, sits next to her. Tim opens a bottle of champagne.

Vi downs the champagne. Bruce riees, gives her a refill as
Tim and Sally sit. Bruce nuzzles Vi's ear as he pours; she
smiles at him and begins to snap her fingers, move her
body...

VI

Bruce sits, Vi sways seductively and turns on RADIO.

VI.

rock music)
You guys ever been to a go-go club?

BRUCE

We visit a lot of cities...

Vi turns her back as she slips off her dress, leaving only
her bikini briefs ana white boots. Sally is a bit uneasy
as she sips on her champagne. Bruce and Tim keep time to
the tempo on various glasses, bottles and tabletops. Vi
steps onto a coffee table and goes into a bored go-go num~
ber. Tim tentatively nuzzles Sally's ear; she moves away
on the couch. Vi turns stripper, pleying directly to
Bruce. She slides her hand down one leg and unzips a boot,
does a bump and grind, turns and takes off the other. As
she dances, we begin to SEE real pain in Vi's face. Sally
senses it, cannot bring herself to interrupt the dance.
Bruce claps his hands and whistles as Vi does a final bump,
then jumps from the table and disappears behind a drape as
the MUSIC CONTINUES. Sally goes to her...

Bruce eagerly gets to his feet, follows. Vi into the bed-

Tim. She still stands by the drapes, deeply effected by
Vi's pain. Tim is also aware of it, sits on the couch.
