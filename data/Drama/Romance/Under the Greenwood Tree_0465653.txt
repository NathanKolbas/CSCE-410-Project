EXT - GREENWOOD TREE/WOOD - NIGHT 1
A clear, black winter sky dusted with white stars.
The occasional snow flake whipped by a cold wind.
The boughs of the greenwood tree, heavy with snow.

A cart rattles along a rutted road, the DRIVER wrapped up
against the chill.

His passenger is FANCY DAY, a woman in her twenties. She
is very attractive, buttoned-up, her bright eyes nervous
and serious as the cart shudders on through the winter
wood.

Leaving quiet to descend once more in the wood.
A long beat.
Then we see an orange glow and a man walking towards us.

DICK DEWEY is in his twenties, a well-built, charming,
good-humoured man. He strides forward, singing happily to
himself, the light from his lamp illuminating his strong,
handsome features.

Dick stops when he hears a man holler a greeting at him
through the wood:

PENNY
Dick? That you, Dick Dewey?

Another lamp swings towards Dick through the darkness.

DICK
The very same, Robert Penny.

A small, bespectacled man steps out of the gloom to shake
hands with Dick, a fiddle tucked under one arm. This is
Robert Penny, the boot-maker.

PENNY
Tis as chill a Christmas Eve as I
remember.

Then another man lumbers out from behind Penny. He is
tall, goofy, perhaps not the sharpest knife in the picnic
hamper, but kind and well-liked. THOMAS LEAF.

LEAF
Hello, our Dick.

DICK
Thomas.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED: 1

PENNY
You be in fine voice, Dick.
Myself, I need some libation on a
cold night.

DICK
Then we'd best get ourselves to
father’s house, Mr Penny.

The three men stride off through the snow.

INT - MELLSTOCK/FANCY’S HOUSE - NIGHT 2

Fancy’s face is illuminated as she lights a lamp. We see
now that she is prettily but quite formally dressed.
Fancy holds up the light to investigate her new home.

It’s spartan and bleak, the walls bare, just some old
bits of furniture, and Fancy can’t stop herself sighing.

We hear Dick, Penny and Leaf as they walk by outside.

EXT - MELLSTOCK/DEWEY HOUSE - NIGHT 4

Dick, Penny and Leaf walk through the small Dorset
village of Mellstock.

One house in particular looks like a cocoon of warmth and
light on this cold night, its windows glowing orange with
light under a ramshackle thatched roof.

The men walk up to the front door, kicking the snow from
their boots.

INT - MELLSTOCK/DEWEY HOUSE - NIGHT 5

REUBEN DEWEY, the village tranter and Dick’s father, is
stooped over a hogshead of cider, expertly broaching it.
He is a man of insight and humour, very much the unspoken
leader of the Mellstock choir.

The house is a chaos of life and battered furniture, kids
and dogs and cats everywhere.

A fire roars in the hearth.

Reuben’s wife, MARY, is fixing some mistletoe to a
ceiling already decked with holly.

REUBEN
I’1l have first call on that, Mrs
Dewey.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED: 5

MARY
I’1l remind you of that when the
barrel is empty.

Their eldest daughter, SUSAN (20), is bringing in food
from the kitchen, trying not to fall over Jim (16),
Bessey (13) or Charley (10).

Dick, Penny and Leaf come into the house, quickly
shutting the door against the cold.

REUBEN
Hello, my sonnies, here you be!

MARY
Come in, come in! Never mind your
shoes. You get yourself by that
fire, Thomas Leaf.

Penny looks at the hogshead and licks his lips.

PENNY
A good drop, Reuben?

REUBEN
We shall soon see, Robert.

SUSAN
(Teasing, to Dick)
Anne said to say she’1ll be coming
tomorrow night.

DICK
She'll be as welcome as anybody
else, then.

BESSEY
Are you going to marry Anne, Dick?

CHARLEY
You said you’d mever marry, Dick,
and live here with mother and
father and me for ever.

Susan laughs out loud at this and goes to answer a knock
at the door.

Dick lifts the laughing Charley over his head.

DICK
And so I shall.

Another group of men from the choir - ELIAS SPINKS;
MICHAEL MAIL and JOSEPH BOWMAN, all with their
instruments, are standing there.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED: (2) 5

SPINKS
Merry Christmas, Mary.

MARY
Merry Christmas, neighbours. Get
yourselves by the fire.

The men of the choir are standing around Reuben and the
keg, watching him tap the barrel with almost religious
fascination.

REUBEN
Fetch us a mug, Suze.

Susan hands her father a mug and he takes it without
looking, like a surgeon taking an instrument from a
nurse.

REUBEN (CONT’D)
Here we go, my sonnies.

Reuben taps the hogshead and a shower of cider sprays up
into the room, soaking Reuben and wetting some of the
others.

MARY
(Scolding)
Reuben!
There is much laughter and reaching for mugs as Reuben
fights to plug the hole and the spraying cider.
INT - MELLSTOCK/FANCY’S HOUSE - NIGHT 6

Fancy is in her dusty bedroom, sweeping and cleaning with
gusto.

It’s dirty work but she is determined to make a go of her
new situation.

A mouse scuttles out from under a wardrobe and Fancy lets
out an involuntary yelp, before she chases the mouse with
her broom.

INT - MELLSTOCK/DEWEY HOUSE - NIGHT 7

A small, delicate, female shoe sits incongruously on a
table.

Reuben, Penny, Leaf, Spinks, Mail and Bowman all sit

around this fascinating object, their faces warm from the
fire and the cider.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

Dick sits away from them by the fire, fixing one of
Charley’s toys as the boy looks on, rapt.

PENNY
You can tell a lot about a person
from their shoes.

MARY
Have you met her?

PENNY
Not yet. She sent her shoe ahead
of her for me to fix.

SUSAN
What’s she like, then?

Penny lifts the shoe up to inspect it.

PENNY
You'll find her delicate but
robust, neighbours. Part country
girl she once was, part educated
lady she is now.

DICK
(Laughing)
You do talk some nonsense, Robert
Penny.
PENNY

(Awed)
This shoe has danced on the
marbled floors of Exeter.

REUBEN
Who will she marry then, my
sonnies? A shoe like that will
need a fancy table to go under.

SPINKS
Then Farmer Shiner’s your man.

Some sage nods of the head at this.

MARY
He’s been rattling around that big
house on his own for too long now.

REUBEN
If Shiner’s not to her liking
it’ll be Parson Maybold, you mark
my words.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED: (2)

MARY
The new parson?

REUBEN
I delivered him a great wooden box
this very day, took four of us to
get it from the cart into the
parsonage.

PENNY
What was in the box, Reuben?

REUBEN
He didn’t say and I thought it
impolite to ask. But more than
once he glanced from the box to
her lodgings with a gleam in his
eyes.

Reuben’s gossip has them all enthralled.

MAIL
Tis a very small shoe.

REUBEN
The littler the maid, the bigger
the riddle.

SUSAN

What do you think, Dick?
Dick stands up.

DICK
I think it’s time for singing.

INT - MELLSTOCK/SHINER’S HOUSE - NIGHT

In total contrast to the chaotic Dewey residence, FARMER
SHINER’s house is silent except for the ticking of a
grandfather clock.

Shiner is in his fifties, a gruff, nouveau riche farmer,
the richest man in the village. The house is expensively
decorated and furnished but lacks a certain warmth.

Shiner has enjoyed a large meal and a large amount of
wine and is stretched out on a chaise longue, gently
snoring.

His ancient dog sleeps as soundly by the crackling
hearth. It farts.
10

EXT - MELLSTOCK/SHINER’S HOUSE - NIGHT 9

The choir - Dick; Reuben; Bowman; Penny; Leaf; Spinks;
Mail et al - stand outside Shiner’s house in the snow.

Silence.

REUBEN
Fortissimy.

Then Reuben makes a flourish with his bow and they all
start playing their instruments with great vim and vigour
and singing with gusto:

CHOIR
(Singing)
“In Bethlehem he was born, O thou
man; In Bethlehem he was born for
mankind’s sake...”

INT - MELLSTOCK/SHINER’S HOUSE - NIGHT 10

The dog hears the cacophony first, leaps up from his
dreams and starts barking.

Shiner is ripped from his slumber by the noise, sits up
with a jolt.

EXT - MELLSTOCK/SHINER’S HOUSE - NIGHT 11

Reuben leads the Mellstock choir in their carol, which is
played with tremendous enthusiasm but only approximate
tunefulness.

A shutter opens in Shiner’s house and the farmer’s florid
face appears in the window.

SHINER
Shut up, will ee! Can’t a man have
a quiet night on Christmas Eve?

The choir are making so much noise that they can’t
actually hear his words.

DICK
What’s Shiner saying, father?

REUBEN
(Mischievous)
I think he wants more. Fortissimy!

Shiner disappears from the window and the choir bash on
with gusto.

(CONTINUED)
11

CONTINUED: 11

Then a jug of water is emptied over them from Shiner’s
window and the grind to a halt.

The window is slammed shut, the shutter closed.

A beat.
REUBEN (CONT’D)
Merry Christmas.
EXT - MELLSTOCK/SCHOOLHOUSE/PARSONAGE - NIGHT 12

The choir shuffle up the main street of the village, snow
falling on their baffled faces.

PENNY
Very unseemly, very.

SPINKS
And he a Churchwarden.

REUBEN
Loneliness and a drop of drink, my
sonnies, what did I tell you?
Still, we’ll ask him to our party
tomorrow night and put him back in
good humour.

The choir stop in the street, mid-way between the
schoolhouse and the parsonage.

LEAF
I’m a-cold.

DICK
Bit more singing, Thomas, and
we'll get some victuals inside
you.
Reuben looks at the parsonage and then Fancy’s house.

REUBEN
Two birds with one stone.

Reuben holds up his bow and they get ready.

REUBEN (CONT’D)
Fortissimy!

Once more the choir attack their instruments with gusto
and sing lustily.

INT - MELLSTOCK/SCHOOLHOUSE/BEDROOM - NIGHT 13

Fancy has already made her little bedroom more homely,
with fresh linen on the bed and a small fire glowing
warmly in the hearth.

She is putting some dresses away, smoothing them out,
loving their style and colour. She is in a white night
dress, hair wild and tumbling over her shoulders.

She turns as the noise of the choir reaches her, walks to
the window with a smile, opens it.

EXT - MELLSTOCK/SCHOOLHOUSE/PARSONAGE - NIGHT 14

As Fancy opens her window it throws a warm orange light
over the upturned faces of the Mellstock men below her.

She looks down at them, her hair tumbling around her
silhouetted beauty and her warm, generous smile, and each
man is smitten.

The choir come to the end of the carol.

FANCY

Thank you, singers, thank you.
PENNY

I‘1l put your shoe by the door,

Miss.

A window opens in the parsonage and a cheery Parson
Maybold is visible there.

MAYBOLD
Very pleasant, singers. Excellent.

Maybold looks over at where Fancy is still framed in her
bedroom window.

The choir follow this following conversation above their
heads as if it were a tennis match.

MAYBOLD (CONT'D)
Miss Day, is it? Welcome to
Mellstock.

FANCY
Thank you kindly, Mr Maybold.

MAYBOLD
I trust you’re settling in well?

FANCY
I am, sir, thank you.

MAYBOLD
Excellent. May I ask you to call
by in the morning before the
service, there’s something I'd
very much like you to see.

FANCY
Certainly, Mr Maybold.

MAYBOLD
(A little awkward)
Splendid. I’1l say good night,
then, and merry Christmas.

FANCY
Merry Christmas, Mr Maybold.

Maybold closes his window.

FANCY (CONT'D)
Merry Christmas, singers.

Fancy Day also closes her window, her loveliness taken
from them.

Snow falls on the choir as they take this all in.

REUBEN
Parson Maybold it is, then.

Some naughty, suppressed laughter from the choir.
REUBEN (CONT’D)

Time for some eating and a small

drop to keep us going, I reckon.
This is met with cheery consensus and the choir move off
down the street.
INT - MELLSTOCK/PARSONAGE - NIGHT 15
A very energised Parson Maybold is in his shirtsleeves
now, attacking the wooden crate with a metal bar, prising

the wood apart.

Finally he steps back and admires his new purchase with
wonderment:

A brand new, pedal-powered harmonium.

EXT - MELLSTOCK CHURCH - NIGHT 16
The ancient parish spire pushes into the starry winter
night as the stragglers from the choir enter the church.
INT - MELLSTOCK CHURCH - NIGHT 17

There is a gallery in the church where the choir sit and
play and even now habit makes them sit there.

Candles gutter as they unwrap bread and swig cider from a
communal jug.

SPINKS
A sight like that was worth
singing for.

REUBEN
As near a thing to a spiritual
vision as ever I wish to see.

PENNY
Prettier even than her shoe.

LEAF
Pretty.

Penny holds up the empty jug.

PENNY
We appear to be dry, Reuben.

REUBEN
Dick has another jug on him. Dick?

They all look around but there is no sight of Dick.
REUBEN (CONT’D)
Dick! Where’s that boy got to?
EXT - MELLSTOCK/SCHOOLHOUSE - NIGHT 18
Dick hasn’t moved since we last saw him. Snow has settled
on his shoulders and head but he doesn’t notice.
He stares up at the now-shuttered window of Fancy Day.

EXT - GREENWOOD TREE - DAY 19

The snow-covered boughs of the greenwood tree glisten in
the cold sunlight.

INT - MELLSTOCK CHURCH - DAY 20

The choir are up on their gallery, singing and playing
with gusto this Christmas morning.

Dick looks over the gallery at where he can see Fancy Day
in her pew, looking beautiful and far more sophisticated
than the other country women around her.

Next to Susan is a lovely young Mellstock woman by the
name of ANNE ROEBUCK and she looks up at Dick with
obvious love and desire.

Susan notices this like she notices most things. She
nudges her mother and they both look over at where Farmer
Shiner, in his best clothes, is looking at Fancy with
something approaching fascination.

Maybold seems full of life and vigour this Christmas
morning, beams down at Fancy from the pulpit.

INT - MELLSTOCK CHURCH - DAY 21
Later.

Parson Maybold is into his Christmas sermon, animated,
articulate.

Up in the gallery some of our out-late carol singers yawn
but Fancy watches the parson with great interest.

MAYBOLD
At the end of one year and the
beginning of the next, we must ask
ourselves how we can best serve
God in the months ahead. For the
world is changing and we must
change with it. How can we best
serve our Lord in this brave new
World? Through our children.

Susan slaps Charley’s hand away from his nose where he is
exploring his nostrils.

MAYBOLD (CONT'D)
Education, education. Give them
the intellectual arrows so that
they can go forth from this
village and make God’s mark on the
greater World. To this end I have
appointed Miss Fancy Day as the
new schoolmistress.

All heads swivel to look at Fancy, who nods a welcome to
them all.

Shiner smiles an enormous smile and Susan and Mary
giggle.

Up in the gallery Dick looks down on Fancy like a love-
sick cow. This is seen by Reuben and it troubles him.

Anne follows Dick’s gaze and frowns when she sees where
it lands.

MAYBOLD (CONT'D)
Miss Day’s talents will not only
be utilised in the classroom,
however. To our enormous good
fortune and to the glory of God
Miss Day has agreed to play the
new harmonium which is to be
installed in the church.

For those up in the gallery who were actually listening
there are ripples of unease.

PENNY
Harmonium? We don’t need no
harmonium, we’ve got a choir.

SPINKS
What does it mean, Reuben?

Reuben says nothing but looks worried.

Maybold has no idea how seismic his words have just been
for the choir.

MAYBOLD
Let us pray.
EXT - MELLSTOCK CHURCH - DAY 22
The villagers make their way out of the church and head

homewards, Maybold waiting outside with a word or a
handshake as Fancy stands nearby.

CONTINUED: 22

Dick stands on his own, just staring over at Fancy.

Reuben is the centre of a huddle of troubled choir
members.

SPINKS
At least we know what was in the
box, Reuben.

PENNY
It happened at Flintcombe Ash, it
happened at Longpuddle. A wheezing
contraption of noise replacing the
choir that have been there for a
hundred year and more.

SPINKS
He did look at Miss Day ina
warmer way than Christianity asked
for.

REUBEN
Let’s not get agitated, my
sonnies. I’m sure when the parson
knows how we feel he’1ll think
differently.

PENNY
Tell him now, Reuben.

REUBEN
Tis not the place. I’1ll ask him
and Miss Day to our party tonight,
that should do it.

Anne and Susan walk by Dick, Anne flashing her eyes at
him but his are transfixed by Fancy.

Maybold walks over to Fancy, all smiles.

MAYBOLD
How did you enjoy the sermon, Miss
Day?

FANCY

Very much, Mr Maybold. There was
one small thing.

Maybold looks surprised at this.
FANCY (CONT'D)

I had assumed the congregation
knew of the harmonium.

MAYBOLD
No, no. It was my little Christmas
present to them.

FANCY
I would hate to be seen as the
person who came newly to the
village and threw out the choir.

MAYBOLD
Think nothing of it, Miss Day. The
men will be delighted to put down
their fiddles and join their wives
and children in the pews.

Dick and Reuben are approaching, both looking nervous.

MAYBOLD (CONT'D)
Isn't that so, Mr Dewey? You have
no objection to the arrival of a
fine harmonium and Miss Day's
playing of it?

REUBEN
Well, sir... the thing is... not
to mince up a man’s words and all -

MAYBOLD
Of course you don’t, you a man of
music and all. I’m sure Miss Day’s
playing will make us known
throughout the county.

FANCY
(Hurriedly)
When I’ve properly learnt to play
it, sir.
DICK

(Blurting out)
Party.

They all look at Dick.

MAYBOLD
Excuse me?

DICK
Party.

Dick looks at Fancy who is amused by this handsome,
tongue-tied young man standing in front of her.

Indeed, it would be our honour.

Well, I...
FANCY

Thank you, Mr...?
Dick just looks at her.

REUBEN
Dick Dewey is his name, Miss.

FANCY
I shall very much look forward to
it, Mr Dewey.

MAYBOLD

As will I, Mr Dewey, thank you.

EXT - GEOFFREY DAY'S COTTAGE/YALBURY WOOD - DAY 23
A small, isolated cottage in the middle of a great, dark
wood.

INT - GEOFFREY DAY’S COTTAGE - DAY 24
GEOFFREY DAY is a small, prematurely-wizened man and
Fancy is helping him into a chair by the fire as he
coughs. His body may be frail but his eyes are bright and

intelligent.

The walls of the house are covered in antlers and stuffed
animal heads.

His small dog fusses around him.
FANCY
What were you thinking of, father,
out in the cold like that?
GEOFFREY

I’m a country man, Fancy, it’s in

Fancy sits down in another chair, frowning.

GEOFFREY
Tell me about the party.

FANCY
Mr Dewey kindly asked me to his
house for some dancing tonight.

GEOFFREY
(Unimpressed)
Dewey? The tranter? You should
wait for a better offer to make
your first social appearance.

FANCY
A better offer?

GEOFFREY
Mellstock may only be a small
place, Fancy, and it’s not what I
wished for you -—

FANCY
I’m quite content.

GEOFFREY
(Snappy)
How can you be? You an educated
woman, ready to spread your wings,
stuck in a village school to be
near your ailing father.

Geoffrey has a coughing fit, his lungs weak.

present.

Fancy reaches in her bag but Geoffrey isn’t interested.

GEOFFREY
The only present I want from you
is to see you married and married
well. This will be my last
Christmas -

FANCY
(Shocked)
Father!

GEOFFREY
But I'll not go before I see you
embrace your destiny, Fancy Day. I
promised your mother that on her
last day on this earth.

FANCY
You make me sound like some exotic
butterfly.

GEOFFREY

That’s exactly what you are. Marry

well, my child, and let your

father die a contented man.
Out on Fancy, her father’s words making a deep impression
on her.

Fancy puts out her hands and a delighted Dick takes them.
They start to dance.

Anne watches Dick and Fancy dance with a disappointed
face.

Dick is a fine dancer, it gives him confidence.

Your feet are a little more
articulate than your tongue, Mr

Dewey.

Fancy smiles at this, knows he is flirting.

his sensibilities.

Reuben sidles up to Maybold, articulate with drink.

REUBEN
A word, please, Mr Maybold.

MAYBOLD
Yes, Mr Dewey?

Some of the choir nudge each other as they play, nodding
over to where Reuben is about to state their case.

REUBEN
There has been a misunderstanding,
sir. About the choir and the...
thing you are about to replace it
with.

MAYBOLD
The harmonium.

REUBEN
You seem to think we in the choir
don’t mind being thrown out of the
church, sir.

MAYBOLD
You’re not being excommunicated,
Reuben, but joyously making way
for progress and the Lord’s work.

REUBEN
Begging your pardon, sir, but we
do mind. We mind very much. If,
perhaps, you could bring yourself
to -

MAYBOLD
Change can be painful, I don’t

FANCY
Then I'll have the same.

Pleased at her spirit, Dick hurries off to fill two
glasses.

Maybold appears at her side.

MAYBOLD
A long way from the bright lights
of Exeter, Miss Day.

Maybold lowers his voice conspiratorially.

MAYBOLD (CONT'D)
They’re simple people but kind and
generous. Still, we’ve put in an
appearance, which is the main
thing. Shall I accompany you home,
Miss Day?

The choir strike up their instruments again in a jaunty
melody and couples pair up for another dance.

Fancy is torn between living up to Maybold’s sense of her
social position or staying and enjoying herself.

Shiner blunders up, face red and cheery.

SHINER
Tis my dance I believe, Miss Day.
MAYBOLD
I was just about to escort Miss
Day home.
SHINER

Nonsense, the night is but young.
You get off, Maybold, I’1l escort

Fancy lets Shiner take her into the dance with an
apologetic smile at the disappointed Maybold.

Maybold moves off to be replaced by Anne who takes one of
the glasses from Dick and glugs it down.

ANNE
Waste not want not.

Dick watches Fancy dance with another man and he doesn’t
like it.

EXT - MELLSTOCK —- NIGHT 27

The village is quiet late on Christmas night, muffled
with snow.

Farmer Shiner walks Fancy home, their footsteps
scrunching up the main street.

SHINER
The farm next door to ours came up
for sale and I bought it.
Everybody said I was mad to do it
but I borrowed every last penny I
could and I bought it. And two
years later I bought the farm on
t’other side. They don’t call me
mad any more. Leastways, not to my
face.

Fancy laughs at this, enjoys the older man’s confidence
and solidity.

You’re obviously very good at
business.

want. A big house. The best food
and wine, more money than I can
shake a stick at. But there’s a
price you pay for filling your
days with business.

FANCY
What is that, Mr Shiner?

SHINER
(Awkward)
A lack of wife. Companionship.
Children. Some laughter in a big
old, empty house.

Fancy is touched by his honesty.

SHINER (CONT'D)
(Snapping out of it)
Go in before you catch cold, Miss
Day, and forgive my ramblings.

FANCY
Good night, Mr Shiner.

INT - MELLSTOCK/SCHOOLHOUSE/BEDROOM - NIGHT 28

From an upstairs window Parson Maybold looks out on this
parting, watching intently as Shiner kisses Fancy’s hand
before striding off towards his own house.

EXT - GREENWOOD TREE - DAY 30

The tree is down to it’s bare bones, black and leafless,
the branches scratching in the winter wind.

INT - MELLSTOCK/PARSONAGE - DAY 31

A metronome ticks.

Maybold watches as Fancy plays the harmonium. She makes a
few mistakes but she has a fine, instinctive, emotional
way of playing.

But it’s not a style that pleases Maybold.

MAYBOLD
No, no, no. Miss Day, follow the
music as written.

Maybold brings up a chair and sits very close to Fancy.

FANCY
I’1l never be good enough to play
in church.

MAYBOLD
Nonsense. You merely need more
discipline and less emotion. You
have to feel the structure of the
music.

Maybold starts to play.

MAYBOLD (CONT'D)
ONE and TWO and ONE and TWO...

He plays very well but in a purely technical way.

MAYBOLD (CONT'D)
Put your hands on mine, Miss Day.

Fancy hesitates, it’s an intimate thing to do.

MAYBOLD (CONT'D)
Feel the structure, the beautiful
structure.

Fancy puts her hands over Maybold’s and indeed feels his
rhythm in her hands and arms.

She laughs at the sensation.

MAYBOLD (CONT'D)
(Enjoying himself)
Bellissima! Musica bellissima!

Bravo! Signorina giorno.

Fancy continues to laugh, slightly awed by this handsome
man speaking Italian to her.

MAYBOLD (CONT'D)
I have been starved of good
company, Miss Day. You are an
oasis in the desert.

(CONTINUED)

31 CONTINUED: (2) 31

FANCY
Thank you, Mr Maybold.

MAYBOLD
Have you ever travelled, Miss Day?

FANCY
Not yet but I shall.

MAYBOLD
I hope one day you get the chance.
I have only dipped my toe in the
water myself but I have visited
France -

FANCY
(Really impressed)
You've been to France?

MAYBOLD
I’ve been to France. Est-ce que
vous savez jouer d'un instrument
de musique?

FANCY
Oui. Je jou 1’harmonium

Maybold laughs with delight at this and Fancy is
delighted to be actually conversing in a foreign
language.

32 EXT - COUNTRYSIDE - DAY 32
Dick drives his empty wagon along a remote lane, the grey
English channel falling away to one side.

33 EXT - GEOFFREY DAY'S COTTAGE/YALBURY WOOD - DAY 33

Dick ties up his horse outside the small, isolated
cottage in the dark wood.

A scruffy dog comes roaring out of the house, snarling
and barking.

Dick simply bends down and makes a fuss of the dog who
rolls over.

Fancy comes out of the house, pleased to see him.
FANCY

Dick, you found it. I may call
you, Dick?

DICK
(Pleased)
I suppose you may.

Fancy notices that the dog is wagging away next to Dick.

FANCY
How funny, he only really likes
father. Come in and have something
to eat, you must be frozen.

Dick is very pleased with this warm welcome from Fancy,
follows her into the house.
INT - GEOFFREY DAY’S COTTAGE - DAY 34
Dick follows Fancy down a corridor.
FANCY

There’s not much furniture,

really. Just a few bits and pieces

that used to belong to my mother.

Fancy enters a room, followed by Dick.

FANCY (CONT'D)
You know my father, Geoffrey Day.

GEOFFREY
Welcome, Mr Dewey, you’ll forgive
me if I don’t get up.

But Dick is staring at the familiar figure of Farmer
Shiner who is tucking into a plate of roast lamb.

SHINER
(Cheery)
Mr Dewey, as I live and breathe.
DICK
Mr Shiner.
FANCY
Sit down, Dick, and I’1ll get you a
plate.
GEOFFREY

Superb piece of lamb, Mr Shiner.
Tis kind of you to share it with
us.

SHINER
One sheep less, Mr Day, tis of no
consequence to me.

FANCY
Father’s right. You’re very kind,
Mr Shiner.

SHINER
(Pleased)
Nonsense.

Fancy piles up food on Dick’s plate, smiles at him.

GEOFFREY
Give the boy some wine, Fancy.

Fancy pours Dick a glass of red wine which he looks at
suspiciously.

GEOFFREY (CONT'D)
From France. Care of Mr Shiner.

SHINER
A rather fetching drop of
Bordeaux, though I say so myself.

Dick takes a slug of the wine as if it were cider and it
makes him cough.

This amuses the other men hugely.
Fancy feels for Dick, pours him a glass of water.
GEOFFREY
Best stick to your father’s cider,

eh, Dick?

Out on Fancy, feeling sorry for Dick.

EXT - COUNTRYSIDE - DAY 35

The cart is loaded with Fancy’s furniture and rattles
back towards Mellstock, the winter wind whipping off of
the sea.

Fancy feels she owes Dick some sort of explanation for
her father’s demeanour.

FANCY
You must forgive him if my father
is a little over-enthusiastic
about Mr Shiner.

DICK

It’s his own house, he can like
who he likes.

FANCY
My father used to be a game-keeper
on the Duke ofYalbury’s estate. He
fell in love with a niece of his
employer and married her.

DICK
Your mother?

Fancy nods.

FANCY
She was cut off without a penny or
a kind word. She died two years
later and my father always blamed
himself for dragging her down. He
has made it his life’s work to see
me married well.

This is a subject close to Dick’s heart and he wants to
know her opinion ofon it.

DICK
And what are your thoughts on Mr
Shiner?

FANCY

They’re private, is what they are.
Fancy shivers.

Dick reaches back and grabs a blanket from the back,
wraps it around Fancy’s shoulders.

FANCY (CONT'D)
Thank you.

Their bodies inch together on the seat for warmth and
they shudder off towards home.

INT - MELLSTOCK/FANCY’S HOUSE - DAY 36

Dick and Fancy are manoeuvring a vanity chest into the
schoolhouse.

DICK
I wish you’d let me call father to
help us. You’1l think I don’t know
how to treat a lady.

FANCY
Oh hush, Dick. Besides, we’re
nearly done.

FANCY (CONT'D)
You bring in the last piece and
I’ll fill a basin to wash the soot
off our hands.

Dick strides out of the schoolhouse and Fancy moves to
the range where a kettle sits on a hot plate.

She pours hot water into a basin and then adds cold,
before rolling up her sleeves.

DICK
All done, Miss Day.

FANCY
I suppose you should call me Fancy
now, as we're friends.

DICK
(Plirting)
Is that what we are?

FANCY
Wash your hands, Dick.

DICK
You first, Fancy.

FANCY
But you’re dirtier than me.

DICK
But you’re a lady.

Fancy puts her hands into the water and cleans herself as
Dick watches, fascinated.

FANCY
But now all the hot water is used
up, Dick.

DICK
Cold will do.

FANCY

If you don’t object you could use
the same water as me.

DICK
Not at all. And to save time I
won’t wait ‘til you have done, if
you have no objection?

Dick’s hands join Fancy’s in the basin.

(CONTINUED)
30.
36 CONTINUED: (2) 36

They slip and slide together, both of them excited by the
physical sensations engendered.

FANCY
I hardly know which are my own
hands and which are yours.
(Flustered)
Towel! Towel! Whoever thinks of a
towel until their hands are wet?

DICK
Nobody.

FANCY
Nobody.

Dick holds Fancy’s hands and their eyes meet. Then Fancy
breaks away, suddenly brisk.

FANCY (CONT'D)
Where is that towel?

DICK
Wait, Fancy, I believe you have a
smut of dust on your forehead.

FANCY
I do?

Fancy looks for the mirror.

DICK
Let me, tis soon done.

FANCY
(Flustered)
Well, I -

DICK
Hold still.

Dick dips a corner of a towel into the water.

He gently wipes away an imaginary smut of dirt. Then
suddenly kisses Fancy on the lips making her leap
backwards in surprise.

FANCY
Dick Dewey!

DICK

Is there anything further I can do
for you?

Dick beams a lusty smile at her.

Dick strides off out of the house, very pleased with this
development.

Out on Fancy, touching her lips where he stole a kiss,
heart thumping.

END OF PART TWO

PART THREE

EXT - GREENWOOD TREE - DAY 37

It is spring and the greenwood tree is the brilliant
green of new growth, the grass beneath its boughs
scattered with wild daffodils.

CUT TO:

INT - MELLSTOCK/SCHOOLHOUSE - DAY 38

Fancy is teaching in the schoolhouse. She has transformed
it, covered the walls in drawings and maps, brought in
flowers and tadpoles from the outside world.

We see the Dewey children there, Charley, Jim and Bessey.

The children are all sorts of ages and shapes and sizes,
but they enjoy Fancy’s teaching, shoot their arms up when
she asks a question.

FANCY
They say Venice is the most
beautiful city in the world, with
wondrous paintings and squares and
churches. Piazza San Marco; the
Rialto; Tintoretto; Veronese. And
not a single cart or street to be
seen. Who can tell me why?

Parson Maybold watches all this from the doorway, watches
her energy and spirit, likes what he sees.

INT - MELLSTOCK/SHINER’S HOUSE - DAY 39

Shiner is in his dressing room, struggling with a tie. He
is in his very best clothes, trussed up like a chicken,
tummy pushing against the shiny buttons of his waistcoat.

His dog watches him.

He looks at his clumsy fingers, which are trembling with
nerves.

SHINER
(To Dog)
I’m a stupid old fool, Tristian,
shaking like a leaf at my age, but
the prize is great.

He presents himself to the dog.

SHINER (CONT'D)
How do I look?

The dog barks.

EXT - COUNTRYSIDE - DAY 40

Reuben and Dick are clattering homewards, another job
done.

Dick looks excited and this worries his father.

REUBEN
I’m not a man for giving advice
but if I was, my advice would be
to forget Miss Fancy Day and get
on with your life.

DICK
Why would I forget the woman I
love?

Reuben squirms at this, it’s not what he wants to hear.

REUBEN
Love - you barely know the girl.
Is there an understanding between
you?

DICK
Not yet, but there will be.

REUBEN
She’s destined for greater things
than you, my son.

(CONTINUED)
33.
40 CONTINUED: 40

DICK
We'll see.

Reuben doesn’t like Dick’s certainty one bit.

REUBEN
Any ways, she'll be married to
Shiner before the summer is out.

Dick is disturbed to hear this.

DICK
Who told you that?

REUBEN
Shiner has set his hat on having
her and what Mr Shiner wants Mr
Shiner gets.

DICK
Fancy would never marry for money.

REUBEN
Don’t be a child, son. Miss Day
will do what she has to do, tis
the way of the world.

DICK
You don’t know her.

REUBEN

(Frustrated)
What would you have, an educated
woman like that living as a
tranter’s wife in our crowded
cottage, kids and dogs running
around her legs? Tis not
thinkable, Dick.

Dick knows there is some truth in this and he doesn’t
like to contemplate it.

Anne is working the fields - sleeves rolled up, hands
covered in mud - with some other women from the village
and she flashes Dick the most dazzling smile as they pass
by.

REUBEN (CONT’D)
That’s the woman for you, Dick
Dewey. I hope you have the sense
to see it afore she finds another.
41

34.

EXT - MELLSTOCK/SCHOOLHOUSE/GARDEN - DAY 41

Fancy is snipping at some primroses, far more delicate
and sedate than Anne’s work.

She looks up as Farmer Shiner comes up the path, taking
his hat off.

FANCY
Mr Shiner.

SHINER
Miss Day.

There is an awkward beat between them.

SHINER (CONT'D)
Lovely morning, is it not?

FANCY
It is, yes, very lovely.

Another awkward beat.

FANCY (CONT'D)
Are you going for a walk?

SHINER

I don’t believe in aimless
walking, don’t see the point in
it.

(Hurriedly)
Not that I’d stop you, for I
wouldn’t. You’1l come and go as
you please, you'll not find me a
harsh man in that respect.

FANCY
I’m not sure I understand, Mr
Shiner.

SHINER

I’ve come here to ask for your
hand in marriage, Miss Day. Course
I’ll speak to your father but he
gave me to understand that -

FANCY

Marriage?

Susan and Fancy are laughing and giggling as they sit in

their chairs and mend Fancy’s dresses.

FANCY
Stop it, Susan. It’s not a
laughing matter.

SUSAN
Just imagine! You the mistress of
Mellstock.

FANCY

I haven’t said “yes”, only that I
will consider his proposal.

SUSAN
He will shower you with riches.
Silk dresses from London. Perfumes
from Paris. Diamonds and emeralds
and rubies by the cart load.

FANCY
Stop it now.

Susan stops but Fancy likes what she was saying, all the

same.

FANCY (CONT'D)
Is he a good man?

SUSAN
I believe he is, yes. Hard when he
wants to be, for sure, but you
don’t get to do what he has done
without breaking a few eggs. But

gruffness.

The two women laugh.
FANCY
(Off hand)
How’s Dick, Susan? I haven’t seen
him in an age.
SUSAN
(Pointed)
That’s because you avoid him,
Miss.
Fancy knows she has been rumbled.
FANCY
I think he may have exaggerated my
affection for him.
SUSAN
He’s a little lovelorn I'd say,
since he heard about Mr Shiner.
(Cheery)
Still, father hopes he and Anne
Roebuck will be married before the
year is out.
FANCY
Really?
SUSAN
(Teasing)
But will you, miss, that’s the
question?
EXT - MELLSTOCK/VILLAGE GREEN - DAY 45

It is May Day and a may pole dominates the village green,

Dick dancing around it with Anne and other young people

from the village, the girls wearing white with flowers in

their hair.

The choir are singing and playing and drinking, in their
element.

Fancy stands on her own, trying to look haughty and above
it all, but her toe is tapping to the music.

A very happy Geoffrey Day is sat in the shade, enjoying
the music, as Reuben brings him a drink.

REUBEN
I hear Mr Shiner has proposed,
then?

GEOFFREY

He has. Just waiting for the girl
to say yes.

REUBEN
She will say yes, you think?

GEOFFREY

She’s like her mother, needs to
squeeze the last bit of drama out
of a thing.

(Confident )
But those church bells will be
ringing out by harvest time, you
mark my words.

REUBEN
(Relieved)
I’m very glad to hear that,
Geoffrey.

Fancy looks once more at the dancers on the may pole and
Dick’s eyes catch hers. He walks towards her which makes
Fancy’s heart flutter.

DICK
You’re avoiding me, Fancy.

FANCY
Hardly, Mr Dewey.

Reuben looks over, sees them in conversation and it
troubles him.

Dick hears the formal use of his surname and it hurts
him.

DICK
Back to Mr Dewey?

If you have something to say to me
I'd rather you said it to my face.

way. If I gave you hope then I

I want no apology for a kiss. I
want your honesty. If I -

Then Farmer Shiner arrives at Fancy’s side, making her
immediately tense.

SHINER
Miss Day.

FANCY
Mr Shiner. Would you mind leaving
us alone for a moment, Mr Dewey?

Dick is hurt by this but tries to keep his dignity.

DICK
Not at all, Miss Day.

Dick bows and walks back towards Anne and the other
villagers.

SHINER
I wondered if you’d had time to
think about my offer.

FANCY
I’ve thought about it, of course.

SHINER
No hurry, lass. None at all. I
don’t want you doing anything
against your will, but... I never

us, the pitter patter of little
Shiners.

(Alarmed)
I’1l let you know as soon as my
mind is made up.

Shiner bows and leaves Fancy alone.
Fancy looks over at where someone trips on the may pole,
sending them sprawling into a tangle of limbs and

laughter, Anne falling on top of Dick and being in no
hurry to disengage herself.

EXT - RIVER - DAY 46
Later.
A grumble of thunder.

A troubled Fancy leans against a tree, watching the river
sweep by.

DICK
So you're to marry Farmer Shiner?

Fancy turns at the sound of his voice.

DICK (CONT'D)
He’s too good a man to be kept
dangling from your finger, Miss
Day.

FANCY
How dare you speak to me like
that? Of what business is it of

yours?

I thought it might have been.
Once.

friendship and so do you.

Fancy is rattled by Dick’s correct instinct.

FANCY
I hear that you yourself will be
married before the year is out.
Actually I didn’t “hear”, I saw it
with my own eyes. You get over a
broken heart very quickly, Mr
Dewey, if that’s indeed what it
was.

DICK
Not true, Miss Day. Tis broken and
will remain so until the day you
fix it.

FANCY
You will be waiting until hell
freezes over, then.

It starts to rain, sudden and heavy.

DICK
Let us take shelter, Miss Day.

Dick takes her hand and run into the deep green wood.

EXT -— WOOD - DAY 49

Fancy and Dick have their backs to the trunk of a great
oak.

The rain is relentless, dripping from the leaves and
boughs.

Fancy and Dick are in a cocoon of leaf and water and the
noises of the wood.

Dick takes off his jacket, starts to put it over her
shoulders.

FANCY
Thank you.

Their faces are suddenly close.

Before they know it they are kissing, a kiss of real
desire, surprising them both.

It is Fancy who breaks off the kiss first, surprised and
confused.

DICK
(Tender)
I knew you felt the same, Fancy, I
knew it. I tasted it on your lips
the first time I kissed you.

It’s true and it breaks Fancy’s heart.

FANCY
Take me home, please.
DICK
Say you’ll be mine, Fancy.
FANCY
(Distraught)

You know I cannot.

Fancy pushes a tear away, runs through the wood back
towards the village.

We get the impression that someone is watching the lovers
from inside the wood.

INT - MELLSTOCK/PARSONAGE - DAY 50
Fancy is lost in emotion, excited, confused, upset.

The emotion is replicated in her playing of the
harmonium, beautiful and yearning.

Maybold comes in from outside, listens for a moment in
the doorway, mesmerised by Fancy’s playing. For the first
time, it seems, he sees how lovely she is, how sweet her
music.

She sees he is there and breaks off.

FANCY
Mr Maybold. The door was open and -

MAYBOLD
You play beautifully, Miss Day. I
will have the harmonium moved to
the church within the fortnight.

Fancy nods and for the first time Maybold notices that
she has been crying.

Miss Day, you are distressed.

Maybold fusses over Fancy, genuinely cares for her, lends
her his handkerchief.

MAYBOLD (CONT'D)
What has happened?

FANCY

Have you heard any talk of me?
MAYBOLD

Talk?
FANCY

My name mixed up with another’s? A
man, I mean.

Maybold is taken aback and very disappointed by this.

MAYBOLD
No, I heard no such thing.

FANCY
A man has asked me to marry him
and... I am confused, I don’t know
what to do.

MAYBOLD

(Deeply disappointed)
I see. Do you love this man?

FANCY
There are all sorts of love, are
there not? The passionate sort
that has no future. Or the sort
that starts with liking and gets
deeper with time, perhaps.

Maybold gathers himself, puts his personal disappointment
behind him.

MAYBOLD
You will do the right thing. I
only hope he is worthy of you.

Fancy smiles at Maybold through her tears, appreciates
his respect for her, is more confused than ever.

Shiner sits on his chaise longue, deep in thought, a

nervous.

SHINER

FANCY
I’m sorry for coming unannounced
but I had to see you.

SHINER
Please, sit down. Can I get you -

FANCY
I have considered your offer of
marriage, Mr Shiner, and I’m
afraid that -

Shiner knows what is coming and puts his hand up to

interrupt her.

SHINER
Say nothing more.

FANCY
But I must. In all honesty I
should have been more truthful
from the start and not let you -

SHINER
Let me say one thing, Fancy. I am
a fool, I know, and not versed in
the ways of love.

I know it’s not a Christian thing
to say but I cannot abide that
parson and his new ways.

REUBEN
Maybe but there tis. There’s
nothing to be done.

SPINKS
(Pointed)
Maybe there is, maybe there isn’t.
REUBEN
(Suspicious)
What mean you by that, Elias
Spinks?
PENNY

Maybe a small drop might help the
bad news slide down, Reuben?

REUBEN
Tis a Sunday morning, Robert.

LEAF
(Blurting)
I’d do see them.

All eyes turn to Thomas Leaf, who is giggling to himself.

REUBEN
Who did you see, Leaf?
LEAF
Them. Kissing and such. In the

wood.

(CONTINUED)
47.
CONTINUED: (2) 52

The choir smell some gossipy sport, perk up enormously.
But Dick stiffens, suddenly worried.

PENNY
Who did you see, Thomas?

LEAF
Til she did run away from him,
eyes squirtin’ tears like a
fountain.

DICK
You keep it to yourself, Thomas,
tis no-one’s business.

PENNY
You know his head can’t abide a
secret, Dick, twill tangle him up

inside.
REUBEN
Out with it, Thomas.
DICK
(Threatening)

I’m telling you, Thomas Leaf, you
keep it to yourself.

LEAF
(Blurting)
Twas Dick! Kissing Fancy Day in
Yalbury wood.

Dick is furious, makes a grab for the astonished Leaf.

There is an inglorious scuffle, various members of the
choir trying to stop Dick getting at Leaf.

MARY
What is going on here?

The voice of authority rings out and the men stop
scuffling.

REUBEN
A mere difference of opinion, my
love.

Dick walks straight out of the room, slamming the front
door.

REUBEN (CONT’D)
Tap the cider, Mr Penny, Sabbath
or no.

EXT - MELLSTOCK - DAY 53

The choir walk down the main street towards the church.

They have their instruments in their hands and they are

trying to walk with dignity but they keep slewing across
the road, obviously drunk.

INT - MELLSTOCK CHURCH - DAY 54

The choir are struggling to stay awake during the sermon,
some of them slumped forward over their instruments, most
of them snoring.

Dick sits aloof from them, straight-backed and fuming.
Maybold drones on from the pulpit.

Fancy Day sits in her pew, very conscious that Shiner is
wanting to catch her eye and smile at her.

MAYBOLD

(From Titus, King

James Bible)
“But speak thou the things which
become sound doctrine: That the
aged men be sober, grave,
temperate, sound in faith, in
charity, in patience. The aged
women likewise, that they be in
behaviour as becometh holiness,
not false accusers, not given to
much wine, teachers of good
things; That they may teach the
young women to be sober, to love
their husbands, to love their
children “ -

Penny falls forward, inadvertently letting his bow slur
over the strings of his fiddle.

At this noise William Dewey sits bolt upright and attacks
his fiddle with gusto, playing the lewd song from the May
Day celebrations.

The other members of the choir likewise strike up their
instruments and sing the lusty lyrics.

There is much giggling amongst the younger members of the
congregation but Maybold is absolutely furious,
speechless.

Fancy feels acutely for him.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: 54

DICK
(Appalled)
What are you doing? Stop!

Reuben is the first to realise the enormous error of
their ways.

REUBEN
Stop, my boys, stop!

One by one the choir slur to a confused halt.

EXT - MELLSTOCK CHURCH - DAY 55

Parson Maybold, with a face like thunder, glares over at
Reuben and the other members of the choir as he shakes
hands with his congregation.

REUBEN
How does the old saying go, my
sonnies? Something about valour
and discretion, I do believe.

The choir walk quickly away.
Dick has been waiting for Fancy, intercepts her.

DICK
Fancy.

Fancy is very flustered, doesn’t know what to say.

FANCY
I cannot tarry, I’m afraid, I have
school work to prepare.

DICK
There’s something I must tell you.
We were seen.

FANCY
Who was seen?

Anne approaches them, very upset and tearful.

ANNE
Tis true then, is it, Dick Dewey?
You lead a girl on when all the
time you’re making love to Miss
fancy Fancy Day in Yalbury wood.

Fancy is absolutely mortified that this news is public,
whitens, turns to escape.

(CONTINUED)
50.
55 CONTINUED: 55

ANNE (CONT'D)
You can have him. He’s not worth
it.

Fancy hurries away from the scene, humiliated.

DICK
(After her, agitated)
Fancy!

FANCY
(Angry )
Leave me alone.

56 INT - GEOFFREY DAY’S COTTAGE - DAY 56
A furious Geoffrey Day is confronting Fancy.

GEOFFREY
Have you any idea what people are
saying about you?

FANCY
I don’t care about idle gossip.

GEOFFREY
Well, you should do care! Behaving
like some milk maid trollop.

FANCY
(Shocked)
Father!

GEOFFREY
You will get a reputation and no
respectable man will ever look at
you.

FANCY
It was nothing, it -

GEOFFREY
What would your mother say if she
was here? All our precious hopes
for you -

FANCY
You exaggerate, it was nothing.

GEOFFREY

Nothing? You kiss a man in public
and say twas nothing?

(CONTINUED)
56

57

CONTINUED:

51.
56

FANCY
Just a little flirting, no more.

Geoffrey appears to calm a little.

GEOFFREY
Maybe your reputation is not quite
ruined.

These words from her father hit Fancy hard.

FANCY
Ruined?

GEOFFREY
Of course you will never see the
boy again.

FANCY
We live in the same village, I
teach his brother and sister, I -

GEOFFREY
You know what I mean, Fancy. Drop
him and do it quickly before your
life is undone.

FANCY
(Subdued)
Yes, father.

GEOFFREY
You give me your word on your
mother’s grave?

FANCY
Yes, father.

END OF PART THREE

EXT - GREENWOOD TREE - DAY 57
The branches sway in the breeze.

Dick Dewey leans against the trunk of the tree, waiting
for someone.

There is the sound of footsteps crunching through the
wood and then Fancy Day appears, her face barely visible
under hat and cloak.

(CONTINUED)
52.
57 CONTINUED: 57

As ever, Dick is struck by her beauty.

DICK
Fancy. Do we have to meet like
this, like we’ve done something
wrong?

FANCY
We have done something wrong.
Leastways, I have. I shouldn't
have... done what I did.

DICK
Kissed me?

FANCY
It gave you hope and that was
wrong of me.

DICK
Look into my eyes, Fancy Day, and
tell me it was wrong.

FANCY
I haven’t come here to argue.
You'll find someone more attuned
to your way of life.

DICK
(Sparking)
Attuned? Some village girl, you
mean?

FANCY
I have a duty to my father, to my
education. There are things I want
to do, places I want to go, I -

DICK
Do them with me.

FANCY
You know I cannot.

DICK
(Stung)
I have prospects. One day the
business will be mine and -

FANCY
Please, don’t make this any harder
than it has to be. Some things are
not meant to be and we must accept
that, it’s what has been dealt us.

(CONTINUED)
57

58

53.
CONTINUED: (2) 57

DICK
Never. I will never accept it.

The noise of an animal’s bark deep in the wood startles
the jittery Fancy.

DICK (CONT'D)
Tis only a fox.

FANCY
(Upset)
I wish you every happiness, Dick.
Please never speak to me on this
subject again.

And with that Fancy Day is gone, merging quickly into the
dense wood.

EXT - MELLSTOCK/DEWEY HOUSE - DAY 58

Dick is taking out his bad mood on a pile of logs,
smashing them with his axe.

Reuben comes out, sees the shattered wood and his son’s
Manic energy.

REUBEN
What did that tree ever do to you,
Dick Dewey?

Dick looks up and sees his father standing there.

DICK
I’ve been thinking, father, about
the business. How long have we
been tranters in this village?

REUBEN
Well, there’s me of course. And
father, God bless him. And his
father afore him. And -

DICK
A hundred years and more. And the
business is the same size as it
was when it was started.

REUBEN
Aye, tis a steady sort of work.

(CONTINUED)
58

59

60

54.
CONTINUED: 58

DICK
I don’t want steady, I want more.
Maybe we could buy out another
tranter, or open another business
in Budmouth or Casterbridge.

REUBEN
(Troubled)
We know nothing of Casterbridge.

DICK
We can learn. We could build a new
house -

REUBEN
(Shocked)
We have a house.

DICK
Not some draughty old cottage full
of kids and animals. A proper
house, with gardens and stables
and servants.

Reuben looks at Dick as if he was from another universe
and is upset by these notions of change.

REUBEN
I was born in this house and I‘1l
die in it, too. I want no more
than I’ve got.

DICK
That’s where we’re different,
father. I want a lot more.

Out on Reuben, hurt for himself and troubled for his son.

INT - MELLSTOCK/SCHOOLHOUSE - DAY 59
Fancy is teaching in the little schoolhouse.

She hears the sound of a cart driving by outside, looks
out of the window in time to see Dick rattle by, his face
set and determined.

EXT - WOOD - DAY 60
Geoffrey Day is walking in the woods. He is not a well

man but wheezes his way through the undergrowth, his dog
running ahead of him.

(CONTINUED)
60

61

62

55.
CONTINUED: 60

GEOFFREY
Come on, boy, this way.

Geoffrey takes another step and suddenly a man-trap - a
ghastly mechanism of metal teeth and levers - crushes
shut on his leg.

Geoffrey howls out in agony but is nowhere near strong
enough to release the jaws of the trap.

His dog worries around him, whimpering and afraid.

EXT -— WOOD - DAY 61

Dick drives his horse hard through the wood, reckless
speed a good indication of his mood.

Geoffrey's dog appears suddenly in the middle of the
track and Dick has to slow his cart to avoid running it
over.

DICK
(Irritated)
Stupid dog. You could have killed

us both.
The dog barks at Dick, agitated.
Dick gets down from the cart, feels something is up. Then
he sees the blood on the dog’s coat.
EXT - WOODS - DAY 62
The dog bounds through the woods followed by Dick.
The dog leads Dick to the distraught figure of Geoffrey
Day, almost passed-out through pain, the metal jaws

cutting into his bone.

Dick attempts to pull the jaws apart but even his
strength is no match for the mantrap.

Dick searches in the wood, finds what he is looking for:
a sturdy branch.

GEOFFREY
Hurry, Dick.

He wedges it into the jaws despite renewed howls of pain
from Geoffrey.

(CONTINUED)
56.
62 CONTINUED: 62

Using all his strength Dick uses the branch as a lever
until, finally, the jaws snap open and release Geoffrey's
leg.

63 EXT - MELLSTOCK - DAY 63

Dick drives his cart fast through the middle of
Mellstock, almost knocking over Shiner.

SHINER
What the hell do you think you’re
doing, Dick Dewey?

DICK
Mr Day got caught in a mantrap.

Shiner looks into the back of Dick’s cart where Geoffrey
is passed out, his dog next to him.

SHINER
Get him straight to my house,
Dick, I’1l send for a doctor.

Shiner clambers up onto the cart.

64 INT - MELLSTOCK/SCHOOLHOUSE - DAY 64

Fancy is reading at the front of the schoolhouse as her
pupils concentrate on a task.

Dick Dewey crashes in to the schoolhouse, all eyes on
him.

FANCY
(Shocked)
Mr Dewey.
Some of the naughtier children make kissing noises.
FANCY (CONT'D)
(To Class)
Be quiet!
DICK
You must come, Miss Day. Your
father is hurt.
65 INT - MELLSTOCK/SHINER’S HOUSE - DAY 65
Geoffrey lies in a large bed in fresh linen, propped up

with pillows.

(CONTINUED)
57.
65 CONTINUED: 65

Fancy is at his side, Shiner standing behind her.

FANCY
What were you doing there in the
first place?

GEOFFREY
Just a walk, for old time’s sake.
They've moved the mantraps.

SHINER
The doctor says tis a nasty wound
but a clean one. You’re welcome
here as long as you like,
Geoffrey, I hope that goes without
saying.

FANCY
(Very touched)
Thank you, Mr Shiner, you are most
kind.

SHINER
Just glad to be of help, Miss Day.

Shiner nods to her and leaves the room.

FANCY
After you are well you shall come
and stay with me, father, where I
can keep an eye on you.

GEOFFREY
Isn’t he a fine man? Without his
help I’m not sure I’d be here
talking to you now.

Fancy looks up at this, intrigued.

FANCY
He saved you from the trap?

GEOFFREY
(Lying)
He’s a modest man, he’1ll be
affronted if you mention it. Just
show your gratitude in your
behaviour towards him.

Out on Fancy, already thinking differently on Shiner.
66

58.

EXT - MELLSTOCK - DAY 66

Penny is sat outside his cobbler’s shop, tapping nails
into the heel of a shoe.

He looks up as he hears the sound of men struggling out
of the parsonage with the harmonium and wrestling it up
onto a hand cart.

Maybold is fussing around but not actually doing any of
the physical work.

Other members of the choir in the street at the time -
Mail, Bowman - look over with dismay at the sight.

Fancy stands in front of the schoolhouse, excited but
also conscious of the hurt the harmonium is bringing to
some.

Maybold sees her, waves:

MAYBOLD
Sunday is it, Miss Day! You will
fill that old place with new
music.

Fancy smiles back at Maybold, likes his enthusiasm.
Fancy becomes aware that she is associated with the

harmonium and there are glares and disappointed faces in
her direction.

Anne empties a bucket of dirty water into the gutter with
pointed gusto.

Dick is walking by in his best clothes.

DICK
Miss Day.

FANCY
Mr Dewey. You look very smart.

Dick looks at his clothes as if he hadn’t realised.

DICK
How is your father?

FANCY
Mr Shiner has been most kind, I
don’t know what would have
happened to father without him.

Dick expected some form of thanks for his part in her
father’s rescue but is too polite to mention it.

(CONTINUED)
66

CONTINUED:

59.

DICK
I’m off to Budmouth to rustle up
some new business. No peace for an
ambitious man.

FANCY
Indeed.

DICK
So Sunday is to be your coming out
on the harmonium, is it?

FANCY
It is. I trust the ill-will
towards Mr Maybold and his plans
to better the church have receded?

DICK
The turkeys won’t cheer tis
Christmas, if that’s what you
mean. I hope it goes well, I’m
only sorry I won’t be there.

Fancy has no right to be put-out but this doesn’t stop

her:

With that

FANCY
You won’t be in Church?

DICK
I have to see a man out at
Longpuddle on new business, tis
the only day he can do.

FANCY
(Lowering her voice)
I thought you cared for me just a
little.

DICK
You know I do.

FANCY
I thought you were my friend.

DICK
More than a friend, I had hoped.

FANCY
(Hurt)
Then I shall go into the lion's
den on my own. Good day to you, Mr
Dewey.

Fancy flounces back towards the schoolhouse.

EXT - MELLSTOCK - DAY 67

The church bell peals through the morning as the
villagers of Mellstock make their way to church.

INT - MELLSTOCK/SCHOOLHOUSE/BEDROOM - DAY 68

Fancy is being buttoned into a lovely silk dress by
Susan, who is attempting to cheer Fancy up.

SUSAN
You look beautiful.

FANCY
Not too indecorous for church?

SUSAN
You do this old place a power of
good, miss.

FANCY
I don’t think everyone would agree
with you.

SUSAN
Mr Shiner would.
(Knowing)
And Mr Maybold, I suspect.

FANCY
(Shocked)
Susan! The things you say.

SUSAN
Tis true! I’ve watched his eyes
follow you, full of puppy love.
FANCY
Stop it. I won’t have Mr Maybold’s
name taken in vain.

SUSAN
The Adoration Of Miss Fancy Day.

Fancy laughs despite herself, secretly pleased that she
has made another conquest.

EXT - COUNTRYSIDE - DAY 69

Dick drives his cart up over the moors.
70

INT - MELLSTOCK CHURCH - DAY 70

The gallery is deserted, just a few sticks of broken
furniture and a mouse.

Fancy plays the harmonium. She plays it beautifully.

We see Reuben, William, Leaf, Penny and the other members
of the choir scattered around the congregation, next to
wives and families. This is indeed a bleak day, the end
of an era.

Parson Maybold beams at Fancy from his pulpit, very proud
of her, proud of his church.

Farmer Shiner beams too, trying to catch Fancy’s eye,
deeply in love with her.

Geoffrey glances sideways at Shiner, sees the man’s
sparkling eyes. So all is going to plan.

Susan sees it all, takes it all in.

EXT —- FARM - DAY 71

Dick is in the yard of a large, prosperous farm and is
talking to a large, prosperous man.

FARMER
I’ve worked with the same tranter
for nigh on twenty years.

DICK
I’1l not knock another man’s work,
sir, tis not what I’m about. If he
says what he’s going to do on
time, with good grace and a fine
price —-

FARMER
He has been a bit over-busy this
last year or so. I've had to wait
a few times for ‘ee to come free.

DICK
There’s no waiting with Dewey and
Son, sir, and that’s a promise.
The farmer looks at Dick, tempted.
FARMER

Came all this way on a Sunday just
to try for a bit of custom?

(CONTINUED)
71

72

62.
CONTINUED: 71

DICK
I did, sir.

FARMER
I like a man with a bit of
ambition about him.

The farmer puts his arm around Dick and leads him towards
the farm house.

FARMER (CONT’D)
A man can’t talk business on empty
stomach.

INT - MELLSTOCK/DEWEY HOUSE - DAY 72

Reuben puts his instrument away in an old trunk with an
air of finality, devastated.

Mary watches him from the doorway, very sad for him.

MARY
There’1l be other occasions,
Reuben.

REUBEN

Not in the church. Tis what it was
truly meant for.

Reuben closes the trunk.

REUBEN (CONT'D)
Are you happy, Mary?

Mary is completely dumbfounded by this remark.

MARY
What sort of question is that,
Reuben Dewey?

REUBEN
I’ve never been an ambitious man,
I know that.

Mary goes to him, puts her arms around him.

MARY
You’re all the man I’ve ever
wanted.
(Pointed)
He’s a young man in love, he says
things he don’t mean.

EXT - COUNTRYSIDE - DAY 73
Rain sweeps over the exposed moorland landscape.

Dick puts his shoulder to the wheel of the cart, which is
stuck in thick mud.

EXT - MELLSTOCK - DAY 74

Rain falls over the village, the street deserted.

INT - MELLSTOCK/FANCY’S HOUSE - DAY 75
Rain smears down the window.
Fancy sits on a chair as Parson Maybold swirls around

her, full of the morning’s happenings. She can’t help but
smile at his antics and flattery.

MAYBOLD
What can I say? Beautiful.
Captivating.

FANCY

You flatter me, sir.

MAYBOLD
I have sat in St Paul’s cathedral
itself, with the sun seeping
through the stained-glass and a
wonderful choir in full voice but
I have never heard such music as
played by you today in our humble
Dorset church.

Fancy colours at this.

FANCY
Now I know you are teasing me, Mr
Maybold.

MAYBOLD

(Over-excited)
You bewitch me, Miss Day.

FANCY
(Serious)
Do I, Mr Maybold?
Their eyes catch for a moment and hold each other there.

A beat.

Maybold is about to say something but there is a loud,
confident knock at the door.

FANCY (CONT'D)

Excuse me, sir.
Fancy hurries out to the front door and opens it.

Shiner is standing there, the rain falling on him.

FANCY (CONT'D)
Mr Shiner.

SHINER
You play a tasty melody, Fancy,
and no mistake.

FANCY
Thank you. I -
SHINER
May I come in? Tis a damp day out

here.

Fancy remembers her manners, opens the door and closes it
behind him.

SHINER (CONT'D)
(Serious)

I know I said I wouldn’t press

you, Fancy, but seeing you playing

this morning I -

Shiner breaks off. Standing in the doorway is Parson
Maybold.

SHINER (CONT'D)
Mr Maybold, I didn’t see you
there.

MAYBOLD

congratulate Miss Day on her

performance.
SHINER

A clock ticks.

Fancy sits and sips her tea, as do Parson Maybold and
Farmer Shiner.

The silence is excruciating.

EXT - MELLSTOCK/SCHOOLHOUSE - DAY 77

A weary Dick is driving home in the rain, soaked and
muddy.

He consciously drives by the schoolhouse then changes his
mind, stops the horse.

INT - MELLSTOCK/SCHOOLHOUSE/FANCY’S ROOM - DAY 78

Still the clock ticks and still Fancy, Maybold and Shiner
sit in polite silence.

A gentle knock at the front door means Fancy has the
excuse to leap up and escape the atmosphere:

FANCY
Excuse me.

Fancy hurries out of the room to the front door and opens
it onto a bedraggled Dick. Despite everything she is
instinctively delighted to see him.

FANCY (CONT'D)
Dick!

DICK
I just wondered how your playing
went. I was thinking of you all
morning.

FANCY
(Pleased)
It went well, Dick, thank you.

DICK
I got us some new business. Big
farmer out over Longpuddle way.

FANCY
That’s excellent.

There’s no limit to what can be

And are you that ambitious man,
Dick?

DICK
I believe I am. Though it took
meeting you to make me see it.

A beat.

Dick expects to be invited in but Fancy isn’t budging,
very conscious of her guests in the other room.

DICK (CONT'D)
It’s a wet day and no mistake.

Suddenly Fancy realises the social dilemma she is in.

FANCY
Forgive me, look at you standing
there! Go home and change your
things this minute.

Dick is starting to get suspicious of her behaviour.
DICK
It would be easier to come in out
of the rain, Fancy.

Dick makes a move towards the door and Fancy blocks him.

FANCY
You can’t.

DICK
You are entertaining?

FANCY
Mr Maybold and Mr Shiner are
taking tea with me.

DICK
I see. Tea sounds very pleasant.

FANCY

You can’t come in looking like
that, Dick, what will they think?

DICK
Tis water and mud, I’m sure
they’ve seen both.

FANCY
Go home and get yourself dry.

Fancy is about to close the door but Dick stops her, to
her immense surprise.

FANCY (CONT'D)
What are you doing, Dick Dewey!

MAYBOLD
(From inside)
Everything alright, Miss Day?

FANCY
Yes, thank you, Mr Maybold.
Just... I'll be there shortly.
DICK

Just the tranter’s son, all
covered in muck and not fit to set
before a parson and a rich man.

FANCY
(Hissing)
Don’t you dare make a scene here.

Dick steps back from the schoolhouse.

DICK
I wouldn’t dream of doing such a
thing, Miss Day. For a while I was
blinded by your beauty but I see
you now for what you are.

FANCY
And what, pray, is that?

DICK
I’d marry the lowliest maid in the
county if I loved her. Nor money,
nor learning, nor the opinion of
others would force me from loving
her.

Susan and Fancy are in their underwear, looking at the
dresses in Fancy’s wardrobe.

Fancy is trying to put on a brave face but it’s hard for
her.

SUSAN
It’s beautiful, miss.
FANCY
Wear it.
SUSAN
Me? The very thought.
FANCY
Why shouldn’t you wear it?
SUSAN
Pearls before swine, that’s what

FANCY

Nonsense. Put it on, Susan.
An excited Susan wriggles into the gown.

SUSAN
Think of the dresses you'll be
able to afford next year, miss.

Fancy holds up two dresses, undecided.

FANCY
Whatever do you mean?

SUSAN
Tis all over the village that Mr
Shiner will ask you to be his wife

The great and the good of Mellstock society are there,
taking champagne from servants.

Parson Maybold arrives, waves his greeting over at where
a nervous Shiner waits.

Shiner’s face bursts into a grateful smile when Fancy Day
arrives in his house.

All eyes are on them, everyone expecting some sort of
announcement tonight.

SHINER
You came, Miss Day.

FANCY
Of course I did, Mr Shiner.

A nod from Shiner and a small group of classical
musicians start to play.

EXT - MELLSTOCK/SHINER’S HOUSE - EVENING 85

There is a strange, new-fangled piece of agricultural
machinery in one of Shiner’s fields next to the house and
village children and adults are standing around it in
awe.

Dick is playing skittles with Anne and some of the
others. He looks up at the house as he hears the genteel
noise of the musicians drift on the summer breeze.

Susan is showing her dress off to her mother and covetous
little sister.

Reuben looks over at the machine with dismay as he talks
to Spinks and Penny.

PENNY
Tis a thing of curious beauty.
Blowed if I know what it does.

SPINKS
(Lowering voice)
Some of the younger members have
been talking of not going quite so
quietly, Reuben.

Reuben gives Spinks all his attention at this.

REUBEN
Tis not for us to decide which way
it goes. I’1l not have it said
that Mellstock choir stood in the
way of progress.

Dick is irritated by the sound of genteel music and dance
coming from the great house.

DICK
Father! It’s a party is it not?
REUBEN
I believe that was the general
idea, son.
DICK

Then we’ll have dancing and music
of our own. Let’s strike up a
tune, neighbours.

Dick’s energy is infectious and the villagers of
Mellstock tune instruments and make a space for dancing.

Dick walks up to Anne Roebuck and offers his hand.

DICK (CONT'D)
May I have this dance, Anne?

Anne is very suspicious but still loves this man.

ANNE
All I get is a hand, is it?
DICK
A hand and a dance. Tis all I have
to give.
ANNE
(Pointed)
For now.

Anne takes his hand and Reuben and the choir strike up a
dance melody.

INT - MELLSTOCK/SHINER’S HOUSE - EVENING 86
Couples are dancing to the polite classical music.

Shiner approaches Fancy.

SHINER
May I have the honour of this
dance, Miss Day?

FANCY
The honour is all mine, Mr Shiner.

Shiner takes her hand and they start to dance. Has there
ever been a happier, prouder man?

People make space for the couple, all eyes on them.
Geoffrey Day watches with immense satisfaction.

Maybold watches from a distance, can’t keep his eyes off
Fancy’s beauty.

As they dance by the window Fancy can see Dick dancing in
the garden with Anne in a lustier dance of their own.
Despite everything, it irks her.

EXT - MELLSTOCK/SHINER’S HOUSE - EVENING 87

Dick is glugging down a glass of cider as other villagers
dance and play.

FANCY
You’1l get hiccups, Mr Dewey.

Dick is startled to see Fancy Day standing there.

DICK
Miss Day.

FANCY
A lovely evening.

DICK
So I heard someone say.

Anne and some of the other village girls scowl over at
Fancy. Fancy is conscious that she’s not the all-popular
woman who first arrived in the village and it troubles
her.

FANCY
So we‘ll not even be friends?

DICK

We could have been a lot more if
you'd had the courage.

Life is more complex than that,

Not from where I stand.
FANCY

No, not from where you stand. I
must be getting back to the dance.

DICK
He’s a very lucky man, Miss Day.

Fancy is disconcerted by Dick.

DICK (CONT'D)
Good evening, Miss Day.

FANCY
(With finality)
Good bye, Dick.
With that Fancy turns and walks back towards the house.

Leaving a rather sad Dick Dewey behind as Reuben and the
others play on.

EXT - MELLSTOCK/SHINER’S HOUSE - EVENING 88

Fancy is approaching the house, the shadows dancing
across the candle-lit windows, the classical music now
louder than the Mellstock boys’ music, when she bursts
into tears.

Susan is walking towards her, is immediately concerned.

SUSAN
Miss Day? Whatever is it?

Susan puts gives Fancy her handkerchief.

FANCY
I am such a miserable woman.

SUSAN
Come to the kitchens, miss, and
we’ll clean you up.

FANCY
No, there’s something I have to
do.

INT - MELLSTOCK/SHINER’S HOUSE/LIBRARY - NIGHT 89
Fancy is alone in the relative quiet of the library,
walking around, inspecting the beautiful fabrics, aware

of the expense.

She moves to a window, sees Dick dancing with Anne and
other village girls.

The door opens and Shiner comes in.

SHINER
Fancy. Susan Dewey says you want
to see me.

FANCY

You asked me some time ago if I
would be your wife, Mr Shiner.

SHINER
(Excited)
Say the word, Fancy, and you’1ll
make me the happiest man on this
God's earth.

FANCY
I cannot be your wife, sir. Deep
down I always knew it and should
have told you so a long time ago.

Shiner is devastated, it’s not what he expected.
SHINER
Is it something I have said or
done? Because if it is -
FANCY
You have been nothing but kindness
and patience, sir.
SHINER
Then why? I know I am not the
youngest man but -

FANCY
Because I love another.

Shiner is taken aback by this.

This gentleman and I can never

positions makes it impossible -
SHINER
Tell me who he is.
FANCY
But I believe I know what love is,
Mr Shiner, and what I feel for you
is not it. Forgive me.
Fancy hurries out of the room before she bursts into
tears again.
EXT - MELLSTOCK/SHINER’S HOUSE - EVENING 90

Dick is putting his jacket back on even though the choir
are still playing and villagers are still dancing.

Anne sidles up to him with a sultry smile.

ANNE
Not going already, Dick?

DICK
I have an early start.

ANNE
I’ve never known Dick Dewey be the
first one to leave a dance.

DICK
People change.

ANNE
I don’t change, Dick. I love you
as I have ever loved you.

DICK

Don’t say such things, Anne.

Maybold sits down next to her, still barely hiding his

excitement.
MAYBOLD
I trust you’re enjoying yourself,
Miss Day?
FANCY

Very much, thank you.
A beat as the dancers move by them.

MAYBOLD
I received a most exciting
communication today. Most
exciting.
(Lowers voice)
Can you keep a secret, Miss Day?

Shiner comes into the room, drinking a glass of wine. He

sees Fancy talking to Maybold, notices the intimacy

between them.

MAYBOLD (CONT'D)
I have been asked to become the
parson for the British Consul in
Venice.

FANCY
(Excited)
In Venice?!

MAYBOLD
Can you believe it? I had heard of
the position and had asked some
friends to put my name forward but
I never in my wildest dreams
imagined I would be chosen.

FANCY
Congratulations, Mr Maybold, you
will be much missed.

MAYBOLD
I very much doubt that.

Shiner downs his drink, takes another from a passing
servant, continues looking over at where Maybold and
Fancy are huddled conspiratorially together.

INT - MELLSTOCK/FANCY’S HOUSE - NIGHT 92

Fancy is in her night dress, washing her hands and arms
in her basin.

She is dreamy, miles away.

She looks down and sees Dick’s wet hands and forearms
entwined with hers.

The memory shocks her, makes her step back. And when she
looks again the basin is empty.

INT - MELLSTOCK/PARSONAGE - NIGHT 93

Parson Maybold is happily going about his ablutions,
singing loudly in Italian.

There is a loud knock at his door.

Surprised by the lateness of the hour, Maybold opens the
front door.

Shiner is standing there, has obviously been drinking.

MAYBOLD
(Surprised)
Mr Shiner. Do you realise what
time it is?

SHINER
You're a fool, Maybold.

MAYBOLD
(Appalled)
I beg your pardon?

SHINER
An even bigger fool than me, if
that can be imagined.

You’re drunk, sir. And you a
churchwarden.

SHINER
She loves you but believes you are
above her station. Treat her well,
sir, or you’ll have me to answer
to.

With that Farmer Shiner slurs off down the street.

Leaving an astonished Maybold framed in the front door of
the parsonage.

INT - MELLSTOCK/SCHOOLHOUSE - DAY 94

Susan and Fancy are making jam on a blazing summer’s day,
hands red with damsons.

There are

children all over the kitchen “helping” them,

eating and laughing.

SUSAN
Your father is recovering well, I
hear.

FANCY

Yes, thank you. I hope he will be
back in his own house soon.

SUSAN
It doesn’t bear thinking about
what would have happened if Dick
hadn’t come along.

FANCY

up by that dreadful man-trap.

It wasn’t Dick. I believe it was
Mr Shiner who found my father.

SUSAN
Mr Shiner told them to put your
father in his house but twas Dick
who wrestled him out of the trap.

This is news to Fancy and it troubles her.

FANCY
Dick never said anything to me
about it.

SUSAN

He’s a modest man, miss, it’s not
in his character.

FANCY
(Appalled)
But he must think I know and
haven’t acknowledged my gratitude
to him.

SUSAN
I suppose he must.

Out on Fancy, very upset by this.

EXT - MELLSTOCK/SHINER’S HOUSE - DAY 95

Geoffrey Day is sat out on Shiner’s impeccable lawn,
drinking lemonade on a hot day.

Maybold is pacing around, nervous.

MAYBOLD
Like everybody I assumed that Miss
Day and Mr Shiner would... but
they haven't...

GEOFFREY
She’s a fool and no mistake.

MAYBOLD
Well, yes. But maybe not. If she
loved another from a distance and
thought she had no chance of his
hand due to social chasms not of
her making. Do I make myself
clear, Mr Day?

GEOFFREY
Not completely, sir.

MAYBOLD
How easy it would have been for
her to say yes, to live here
forever in material splendour, not
a worry in the world.

Geoffrey Day looks around the splendid estate wistfully.

MAYBOLD (CONT'D)
But she showed loyalty to a love
that she thought could never be,
even if it left her eking out a
living in a village school for the
rest of her life.

This is all very depressing for Geoffrey.

MAYBOLD (CONT'D)
I have come, sir, to reward her
for her courage. With your
permission I will reach down and
lift her up into a world of beauty
and learning.

Geoffrey looks at Maybold with complete bewilderment.
MAYBOLD (CONT'D)

I want your daughter for my wife,

sir.
For a moment Geoffrey is stunned. Then a large smile
spreads across his face.
EXT - COUNTRYSIDE - DAY 96
Fancy walks through the thick grass down by the river.

A dark green river slips by, an image of cool in a hot,
hot afternoon.

She comes across Dick’s discarded shirt, picks it up.
Then she sees him. On the far side of the river, up to
his waist in water, his naked torso glistening with sweat
as he harvests nuts from the hardest-to-reach bushes.

Fancy just watches him for a moment, watches his easy
grace and confidence. Then she walks towards him.

FANCY

It’s just too bad of you, Dick
Dewey.

Dick turns at the sound of her voice. He is amazed to see
her here, conscious that he is half naked beneath her
gaze.

had saved my father when I now
know it was you.

DICK
It’s of no importance. If I may
have my -

Dick wades towards her to get his shirt but Fancy
playfully skips out of his reach.

FANCY
It is of enormous importance and
could have had enormous
repercussions.

DICK

FANCY
Did you know what I said no to Mr
Shiner’s offer of marriage?

DICK
I heard something said.

FANCY
What do you think about that, Mr
Dewey?

DICK
I have no opinion of my betters,
miss. Are you going to give me my
shirt, Miss Day?

FANCY
I haven’t decided yet.

A beat.
Then Dick lurches towards Fancy who screams and attempts
to evade his grasp but only ends up slipping on the wet
stones and crashing into the river.
DICK

The current catches the startled Fancy and swings her
downstream.

Dick crashes after her through the water and lifts her
up, carries her to the bank.

As he lies her down, her wet hair framing her lovely
face, Dick Dewey can pretend no more:

DICK (CONT'D)
You ask me what I think? This is
what I think.
Dick kisses Fancy passionately on the mouth.
For a moment her startled arms are spreadeagled on the
grass but slowly they find his back, feel his muscles
beneath her fingers as they kiss.

Fancy’s shoe bobs off downstream, unnoticed.

Marry Dick Dewey?

FANCY

You think so little of me?

Fancy trembles with anger but knows she has gone too far.

GEOFFREY (CONT’D)
I did it because I love you,
Fancy, more than any father loved

a daughter.

FANCY
Then why do you not let me be
happy?

GEOFFREY

Happy married to Dick Dewey? In a
damp house, babies hanging from
your breasts, back broken with
labour, your husband working from
dawn til dusk just to put a crust
on the table?

This word picture doesn’t sit well with Fancy.

FANCY

(Angry )
You exaggerate.

GEOFFREY
Do I? You would hate it, you know
you would. And in time you would
hate the man who married you and
put you there.

FANCY
You underestimate me, father.

great things, to go to places that
aman like Dick Dewey can only

GEOFFREY
I cannot, Fancy. And one day you
will thank me for it.

frustration.

Shooo! Off home with you this

Maybold claps his hands and the nervous children clatter
out of the classroom, finally leaving it to Fancy and
Maybold.

FANCY
What can be so important, sir,
that it could not wait another
hour?

MAYBOLD
My heart was overflowing, Miss
Day, my mind a chaos of imagery
and excitement. I simply had to
talk to you.

Mere weeks after that we will be

Now it is Maybold’s turn to be puzzled.

MAYBOLD

voices, a curse and more giggles as someone bangs into a

pew.

A lamp flickers on to reveal Thomas Leaf, Spinks and some
of the younger men in the choir.

SPINKS

The lamp illuminates the new harmonium.
SPINKS (CONT'D)

It’s Sunday and Fancy Day is playing the harmonium
beautifully, for a moment escaping her complicated life

through music.

A rather shell-shocked Maybold stands in the pulpit,
mouthing the words.

Shiner glances at her, knows he will never have her.
Dick watches his beloved with pride as she plays.

Reuben notices first, his musician’s ear picking up the
flat note.

harder Fancy plays the more bizarre the noises emanating
from it.

Leaf, Bowman and some of the others exchange
conspiratorial looks which are noticed by Reuben.

Giggles have changed to outright laughter now. It’s good-
humoured laughter, really, but to the proud Fancy it
sounds like cruel mocking.

She looks around the faces of the choir as she plays,
sees the open mouths of the villagers laughing at her,
sees even Dick chuckling to himself. Only Maybold stands
by her, a rock of support in the pulpit.

She’s had enough. Humiliated, Fancy gets up from her
stool and runs from the church.
EXT - MELLSTOCK CHURCH - DAY 104

Fancy flees the church, upset, starting to cry with anger
and humiliation.

Dick is the first out of the church, running after her.

DICK
Fancy!

Fancy half-turns at this but only manages to tangle up
her legs in her dress, sending her sprawling in the
Mellstock dust.

Dick is quickly beside her as Maybold and the rest of the
congregation pour out of the church to watch the goings-
on.

DICK (CONT'D)

Dick lifts the humiliated Fancy to her feet. The palms of
her hands are bleeding, her lovely face scratched and
dusty.

FANCY

It’s a hateful, mean, gossipy
little place and I want no more of

Fancy starts to hurry towards the safety of the
schoolhouse.

Dick hurries after her, concerned.

Fancy runs to the schoolhouse, lets herself in and slams
the door shut.

Fancy bolts the door.

She gets a look of herself in the mirror: hair unkempt,
face dirty, hands bleeding, dress ripped. She sits down

on behalf of my congregation for
that shameful display, Miss Day.
You are the best thing to have
happened to this village for a
generation and this is how they
treat you.

Fancy nods, strangely flattered.

lush branches, making them creak and whine and rustle.

Fancy tosses and turns in her sleep, a branch banging
against her window.

CUT TO:

- The distorted, mocking faces of the Mellstock villagers
as they laugh at her.

- Fancy’s hands entwined with another. She looks up,
expecting to see Dick, but it’s Maybold smiling at her.

- An image of herself outside the Dewey house, weighed
down with crying kids, hair lank, looking out at us in
misery.

- Dick up to his waist in the river, his torso so naked
as he picks nuts. He turns to look at Fancy. He smiles.
Such a smile. And puts his hand out to Fancy, beckoning
her towards him.

Fancy sits bolt upright. Someone is throwing stones at
her window.

She gets out of bed and hurries to the window, opens it.

bright Like the stars at night

No diamonds could shine so

So in with my true love I did go.

The singing is lovely and it moves Fancy deeply.
She looks down into the sparkling eyes of Dick Dewey.

A rumble of thunder above the village.

INT - MELLSTOCK/PARSONAGE - NIGHT 108

Parson Maybold hurries downstairs in his night gown, a
storm raging outside.

The door is knocked again.

MAYBOLD
Alright, alright.

Maybold opens the door and is amazed to see a soaking
Fancy Day standing there.

MAYBOLD (CONT'D)
My dear, my own one. What are you
doing here?

FANCY
I had to speak to you.

MAYBOLD
(Excited)
You have thought about my offer?

FANCY
I cannot marry you, sir.

A beat as Maybold looks at her.

MAYBOLD
You're nervous, it’s to be
expected. In the morning we will -

FANCY
I had no right to even consider
it, Mr Maybold, as I have already
said yes to another.

Maybold is stunned by this news.

MAYBOLD

Another? Who is this other man?
FANCY

The man I love, sir.
MAYBOLD

I have no chance against him?
FANCY

None.
MAYBOLD

(Very hurt)

I would have made you sing, Fancy

Day.
FANCY

You will find out the gentleman's
name soon enough, sir, and you
could cause him great hurt by
mentioning what has gone on
between us today.

A beat as Maybold looks at her.

MAYBOLD
Good night, Miss Day.

Maybold shuts the door on Fancy Day.

EXT - COUNTRYSIDE - DAY 109

A beautiful summer’s day, the hay bales dotted around the
fields under a hot sun.

Dick is working in the fields as are most of the
villagers at harvest time. He works with a scythe, his
body slick with sweat.

Susan is working next to her parents, Mary and Reuben.

Anne is there. Bowman, Mail, Leaf, Spinks, Penny are all
there, chatting and working and laughing.

Even Geoffrey is there, determined to help despite his
ill health.

Dick takes a swig of cider from a jug.

MARY
Reuben.

Reuben looks up at where his wife is looking, sees the
incongruous sight of Fancy Day walking across the
stubbled meadow towards them.

One by one the villagers are aware of Fancy walking
through them, unbuttoning her jacket as she walks.

GEOFFREY
(Shocked)
What are you doing here, Fancy?
FANCY
Come to help, of course.
GEOFFREY
Your hands were not made for work
like this.
FANCY
(Quiet)

When were you happiest?

GEOFFREY
What has that to do with anything?

FANCY
We both know the answer. If mother
was here she’d want me to marry
for love, father, like she married
you for love.

Geoffrey says nothing, recognises a calm determination in
his daughter he has never seen before.

Dick stands, amazed, as she walks towards him.

FANCY (CONT'D)
Tis a hot day.

Dick says nothing, just watches as she takes the jug from
his hand and glugs down some cider herself.

All the villagers watch her, fascinated, as she rolls her
sleeves up in readiness for work.

FANCY (CONT'D)
There was one thing I wanted to
say to you, Dick Dewey.

DICK
What might that be?

FANCY
Marry me.

Dick loves the words but is still amazed to hear them
spoken of out here in public.

With that Fancy puts her arms around Dick and kisses him
fully on the lips. Dick reciprocates and they enjoy a
long kiss in front of the beaming villagers.
Anne frowns a bit but Susan passes her a cider jug.
Mary's eyes water and Reuben puts his arm around her.
REUBEN

Well, well, my sonnies.
EXT - GREENWOOD TREE - DAY 110
The tree is brown and red and orange, the first leaves
drifting off in the autumn breeze.

EXT - COUNTRYSIDE - DAY 111

Maybold is being driven away from Mellstock, all his
belongings in the back of the cart.

The Mellstock bells start a joyous wedding peal in the
valley behind him.

EXT - MELLSTOCK/VILLAGE GREEN - DAY 112
A new, beautifully-painted waggon waits next to the
church, covered in ribbons and flowers. The crisp, gold-

etched writing reads DEWEY & SON.

Fancy and Dick are married and dancing on the village
green.

Susan dances with Mail, a little sparkle between them.

Anne dances with Shiner, who whispers something saucy in
her ear and makes her laugh.

Reuben dances with Mary, both of them still very much in
love.

Leaf dances with little Bessey.

Geoffrey Day leans on the cider barrel as he drinks and
watches, resigned to it all.

The rest of the choir are bashing out a lusty tune.

DICK
I wonder why Parson Maybold took
off like that, straight after
marrying us?

FANCY
He was impatient to find his place
in the world, Dick. I was like
that once.

And she kisses him and the kiss goes on for ever, until

the dancers are dots on a village green and fields and
woods spread for miles.

THE END
