THE MAIN TITLE BEGINS.
INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

CLOSE ON A SIMPLE OVERNIGHT BAG. It rests on a mussed
bed in a hotel room. An unseen Packer is refilling it
for the trip home. A few shirts, socks, underwear..

MACON'S V.O.
The Business. Traveler should bring
only what fits in a carry-on bag.
Checking your luggage is asking
for trouble.

The Packer carefully adds a clear plastic bag containing
a variety of travel-size packets of detergent, shoe
polish, antacid, shampoo, etc.

MACON'S V.O.
Add several travel-size packets of
detergent so you won't fall into
the hands of unfamiliar laundries.
There are very few necessities in
this world which do not come in
travel-size packets.

The Packer lays in a shaving kit. And on top of it a
small format guidebook, well-thumbed and annotated, with
a cover illustration of an armchair with wines. Above
the drawing it reads THE ACCIDENTAL TOURIST and below

IN_THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES.

SOMETHING WIPES THE FRAME and we see that the Packer has
laid a gray suit on the bed next to the overnight bag.
Now, he reaches in and picks up the trousers.

MACON'S V.O.
One suit is plenty...if you take
along travel-size packets of spot
remover. The suit should be
medium gray. Gray not only hides
the dirt, but is handy for sudden
funerals.

The Packer takes us back to the overnight bag as he lays
in a thick novel entitled MISS MACINTOSH, MY DARLING.

MACON'S V.O.
Always bring a book as protection
against strangers.

MACON'S V.O. (CONT'D)
Magazines don't last and newspapers
from elsewhere will remind you you
don't belong. But don't take more
than one book. It is a common
mistake to overestimate one's
potential free time and
consequently overpack. In travel,
as in most of life, less is
invariably more.

Now the Packer pauses. He holds this last item a long
time in his hands. It is a small, framed snapshot of a
smiling young Boy.

MACON'S V.O.
And most importantly, never take
along anything on your journey
so valuable or dear...that its
loss would devastate you.

For the first time, we are CLOSE ON the face of the
Packer. His name is MACON LEARY. As he looks at the
photograph in his hands, his countenance is masked with
grief. And in his eyes, much pain. But no tears.

SMASH CUT TO:

2 EXT. L-1011 - DAY 2

A BEAUTIFUL CLOUDSCAPE -- white, billowing, extravagant.
But no blue sky. Because, as a HORRIFIC ROAR suddenly
rushes at us, we see an L-1011 burst into sight BELOW
US at five hundred miles an hour and immediately dis-
appear, and we realize that we are LOOKING DOWN. And as
the ROAR FADES into the much more familiar DRONE of a
jetliner's cabin --

THE MAIN TITLE ENDS.

3 INT. L-1011 - DAY

Macon is in the aisle seat of a three-across arrangement.
In the middle seat is an enormously fat fellow, MR.
LOOMIS. He is so big that Macon is very nearly in the
aisle, with his knees jutting out to one side. No matter
how intently Macon pretends to be reading MISS MACINTOSH,
MY DARLING, Mr. Loomis continues to look his way.

Finally the fat man offers his hand.

MR. LOOMIS
I'm sorry I'm so fat. Name's

MACON
Macon Leary.

MR. LOOMIS
One of these seats is not really
enough for me. And the stupid
thing is, I travel for a living.
I demonstrate software to computer
stores. What do you do, Mr. Leary?

MACON
I write travel guidebooks.
MR. LOOMIS
Is that so? What kind?
MACON

Oh, guides for businessmen.
People just like you, I guess.

someone encased in a parka. He is suddenly excited.

He points

MACON
Why, yes.

MR. LOOMIS

Really? Am I right? Well, what
do you know. Look at this. Gray
suit. Just what you recommend.
Appropriate for all occasions.

MR. LOOMIS
See my luggage? Carry-on. Change

MACON
Well, good.

MR. LOOMIS
You're my hero! You've improved
my trips a hundred percent.

MR. LOOMIS (CONT'D)
All those other books waste my
time telling me how to see as much
of these cities as possible.
Yours are the only ones that tell
me what I really want -- how to —
see as little. I tell my wife,
"Going with the Accidental Tourist
is like going in a cocoon."

MACON
Well, this is very nice to hear.

. MR. LOOMIS
Times I've flown clear to Oregon
and hardly knew I'd left Baltimore.

MACON
Excellent.

Mr. Loomis notices the book on Macon's lap.

MR. LOOMIS
I see you've got your book there
for protection.

Macon shrugs, embarrassed.

MR. LOOMIS
(jovial)
Didn't work with me though, did

it?

(laughs, tickled)
Say, I'll bet this happens to
you all the time. Running into
your fans, people knowing your
work.

MACON
(thinks about it)
No...Actually, this is the first
time. .

EXT. ARRIVAL ZONE, WASHINGTON-BALTIMORE AIRPORT - NIGHT 4

Rain. Traffic at the curb. Cops move waiting cars
along.

Macon comes out with his overnight bag and spots a
Toyota up the curb. He puts his bag in the back seat as
the Driver scoots over to the passenger side in front.
INT. MACON'S CAR - NIGHT

Macon gets in the driver's seat and leans over to kiss
his wife SARAH. She is a beautiful woman, but the

events of the last year have had an effect on her and she
does not look beautiful right now.

MACON
Hello, Sarah.

SARAH
Hello, Macon.

MACON

(adjusting the mirror)
I appreciate this.

SARAH
The rain is terrible.

MACON
(turns to pull out)
I don't mind 2 little rain.

INT./EXT. MACON'S CAR - NIGHT

They leave the airport and head for Baltimore. Sarah
leans her head against her window, tense. Enormous
raindrops spatter the windshield. The wipers work:
TICK-SWOOSH, TICK-SWOOSH. .

SARAH
I don't know how you can see to
drive.

MACON
Maybe you should put on your
glasses,

SARAH

Putting on my glasses would help
you to see?

MACON
Not me, you. You're focused on
the windshield instead of the
road.

INT./EXT. MACON’S CAR - UNDERPASS/HIGHWAY - NIGHT
The car shoots through an underpass. The rain stops
completely for a moment. QUIET. Sarah reacts, then the
HAMMERING on the roof starts again.

(CONTINUED )
CONTINUED: -

SARAH
We could stop and wait this out.

MACON .
Sarah, if I felt we were in the
slightest danger I'd have pulled
over long ago.

SARAH
You're not a comfort, Macon.

MACON
(looks at her) .
Honey, I'm trying to be.

SARAH
You just go on your same old way
like before. Your little routines
and rituals, day after day.

MACON
You're not the only one, Sarah.
I don't know why you feel it's
your loss alone.

SARAH
Well, I just do, sometimes.

A wide lake in the center of the highway crashes against
the underside of the car. Macon pumps his brakes.

SARAH
Do you suppose that person has
any idea? I want to go see him
in prison, Macon. I want to say,
"Look at me. Look. Look at what
you did. You didn't just kill the
people you shot. What you did
goes on and on forever. You
didn't just kill my son, you
killed me, you killed my husband.
Do you understand what you did?"
Then when I'm sure that he does
understand, that he feels just
terrible... I'm going to open my
purse and pull out a gun and
shoot him between the eyes.

MACON
Oh, well, sweetheart --

SARAH’
Lord, I don't think I've ever seen
a@ gun. Isn't it odd?

SARAH (CONT'D)
Ethan's seen one; Ethan had an
experience you and I have no
notion of.

MACON
Sarah, it's bad for you to talk
like this.

SARAH

Oh? How am I supposed to talk?
Macon massages his forehead.

MACON
Sarah, I just feel we can't afford
to have these thoughts.

SARAH
Just shut the door, Macon. Just
pretend it never happened. Go
rearrange your tools, why don't
you, line up your wrenches from
biggest to smallest instead of
smallest to biggest -- that's
always fun.

Macon chews the inside of his cheek. Sarah slumps in her
seat.

SARAH
Macon, I want a divorce.

MACON
What?

The car swerves.

MACON
What? What did you say?

SARAH
I just can't live with you anymore.

MACON
(after a beat)
Honey. Listen. It's been a hard
year. We've had a hard time.
People who lose a child often feel
this way. Everybody says it's a
terrible strain on a marriage.

SARAH
I'd like to find a place of my
own as soon as we get back.

Macon looks at her, too long. Then, finally, back at the
road. They drive in silence, until --

MACON
Place of your own. Well. All
right. If that's what you really
want.

SARAH
You can keep the house. You never
did like moving.

INT. /EXT. MACON'S CAR - GAS STATION - NIGHT 8

This makes her finally break down. She turns away.
Macon switches his right -blinker on. He pulls into a
gas station, parks beneath the overhang, and cuts off
the engine. The only sound is the DRUMMING of rain on
the overhang far above them.

INT. MACON'S HOUSE (SERIES OF SHOTS) - DAY/NIGHT

INT. BATHROOM - MACON'S HOUSE (MONTAGE) 9
Macon is living alone for the first time. He comes into

the bathroom, takes off his pajama top and puts it in

the hamper. He begins to shave.

INT. KITCHEN -.MACON'S HOUSE (MONTAGE) 10
In the kitchen, Macon, neatly dressed; fixes himself

eggs and reads the paper. EDWARD, his Welsh Corgi dog,
eats from a dog food bowl.

INT. OFFICE - MACON'S HOUSE (MONTAGE) 11

In_his office, Macon sits down resolutely at his type-
writer. He puts some paper in and begins to look through
his notes -- very self-possessed, very disciplined. He
types --

MACON'S V.O.
In the southeast they say that if
you want to go to Heaven, you have
to change planes in Atlanta. The
airport there must have ten miles
of corridors...

INT. MACON'S OFFICE - DAY 12

ANOTHER DAY. Macon is talking on the phone at his desk.
He wears a different outfit, a bit less neat. Something
i i i oO i .

MACON
She didn't leave me, Rose. We
decided to separate, that's all.
The last thing I need is my sister
saying, "Oh, poor Macon, how could
Sarah do this to you."

ROSE (ON PHONE)
Why would I say that? Everybody
knows the Leary men are difficult
to live with.

MACON
Oh.
We begin to INTERCUT:
INT. KITCHEN - ROSE'S HOUSE - DAY 124

ROSE LEARY, Macon's sister, is in the kitchen of her
house. As she talks to Macon she continues to tinker
with the motor of some disassembled appliance which is
spread in pieces across the table.
ROSE
Where is she?
MACON
She's got an apartment downtown.
ROSE
Has she been in touch since she

left?

She's come by once or twice. Once,
actually. For things she needed.

ROSE
What kind of things?

MACON
Well, a double boiler. Things
like that.

ROSE
She was checking to see how you're
doing. Did you talk at all?

MACON
No. I just handed her the
double boiler.

ROSE
Oh, Macon. You might have asked
her in.

MACON

I was scared she'd say no.

ROSE
(after silence)
Well. Anyhow.

But I'm ing ale !
getting along!

ROSE
Yes, of course you are.

INT. MACON'S HOUSE (SERIES OF SHOTS) - DAY/NIGHT
In the living room, Macon peers at "Nightwatch" with an 13

unreasonable intensity. He is wearing a gray sweatsuit.
His dog Edward snuggles beside him.

In_his bedroom, Macon turns off his morning alarm and 14
rolls over. He squints in the light at a coffee maker

and a popcorn popper, both on timers, both doing their
thing right next to his bed. He slides out of bed toward
the. bathroom. He is wearing the same gray sweatsuit. It
looks worse. Edward lifts his head from among the

covers.

» Macon, still in his sweatsuit, opens 15
the laundry chute and a squared-off column of dirty
laundry drops down into his basket. He stoops to lift it
and pauses for a second, careful with his back.
16

THE ACCIDENTAL TOURIST - Rev. 12/14/87 10a.

In the kitchen, at dusk, Macon stands staring into the 16
refrigerator trying to decide on dinner. Finally he

closes the refrigerator door and opens the freezer. He
takes out a container of ice cream. He stands at the

back door, staring out at the yard, eating his dinner

from the carton.

INT. MACON'S OFFICE - DAY 17
Macon, in his gamy gray sweatsuit, slight stubble on his
chin, again sits in front of his typewriter with the
Phone to his ear. The sheet in the typewriter has only
one sentence fragment on it: "The traveler should be
forewarned..."
SARAH (ON PHONE)
I thought I'd drop over and pick
it up Saturday morning, if that's
convenient.
MACON:
I leave for England tomorrow
afternoon.
We begin to INTERCUT:
INT. SARAH'S APARTMENT - DAY 18

CLOSE ON Sarah in a high-backed chair. We can't see her
apartment except as it is reflected in her expression as
she looks around during the conversation.

MACON -
* Maybe I could bring the rug over.
SARAH
I'll just let myself in on
Saturday.
MACON

That way, I could see your
apartment. I've never been inside,

you know.

SARAH
It's a disaster. Nothing's been
done.

Macon is silent, waiting.

SARAH
I should have agreed to teach
summer school. Something. I open
my eyes in the morning and think,
"Why bother getting up?"

_ MACON
Me too.
SARAH
Why bother eating? Why bother
breathing?

I'm gone.

SARAH

If that's all right.

INT. /EXT. MACON'S CAR - MEOW-BOW HOSPITAL AND STREET - 19
DAY

Macon, wearing his medium-gray traveling suit, drives
along peering at all the signs on the businesses. Edward
is perched happily next to him, looking out the passenger
window. Macon sees a sign across the street: MEOW-BOW
ANIMAL HOSPITAL.

Macon brakes suddenly and Edward lurches onto the floor.

MACON
(to dog)
Sorry.

He makes a left turn into the parking lot.

INT. MEOW-BOW ANIMAL HOSPITAL - DAY 20

Macon drags Edward into the waiting room. The dog is
WHIMPERING, his claws scrabbling on the linoleum, rump
shaking. He doesn't like this. Behind the counter
stands a thin Young Woman in a ruffled peasant blouse.
She has aggressively frizzy hair that burgeons to her
shoulders like an Arab headdress. Her name is MURIEL
PRITCHETT.

MURIEL
Hi, there.

MACON
Do you board dogs?

MURIEL
Sure.

MACON

I'd like to board Edward, here.
She leans over the counter to look at Edward.

MURIEL

Couldn't you make an exception?.

She thinks it over, frowning down at Edward.

MACON
Please. I've just come from the
place we've used in the past and
suddenly they tell me they can't
take him anymore, that he bit
someone last time.

MURIEL
Edward? Do you bite? How could
you.do such a thing? ~-

MACON
I'm about to catch a plane. I'm
leaving for a week, and I don't
have a soul to look after him.
I'm desperate, I tell you.

She glances up at him sharply, surprised.

MURIEL
_ Can't you leave him home with your
wife?
MACON
No.
MURIEL

Oh. You're not married?

MACON
Well, I am, but she's...living
elsewhere. They don't allow pets.

MURIEL
Oh.

Muriel comes out from behind the counter. She is wearing
very short red shorts. Edward begins to calm down.

Edward folds his ears back inviting a pat. She bends
and strokes his head.

MACON
So will you keep him?

MURIEL
Oh, I guess. If you're desperate.
(hands him a form)
Fill this out. Your name and
address and when you'll be back.
Don't forget to put when you'll
be back.

Macon nods, uncapping his fountain pen.

MURIEL
I'll most likely see you again
when you come to pick him up. I
mean if you put the time of day
to expect you. My name's Muriel.

Muriel Pritchett.

INT. LONDON UNDERGROUND - DAY 21

Macon rides an impossibly steep escalator into the bowels
of the city.

MACON'S V.0O.
-I recommend the Underground for
everyone except those afraid of
heights, and even for them if they
will avoid the following stations...

INT. LONDON HOTEL ROOM - DAY 22

Macon, just arrived, regards the modest room neutrally

-- except for the horrible, standard-issue bedspread,
which seems to cause him particular distress. He quickly
strips it from the bed, folds it and stuffs it in the
closet. He turns back to the room. That's better.

all red, white and blue decor.

INT. "MY AMERICAN COUSIN" RESTAURANT - DAY 24

Macon is making notes in a previous edition of The

i i i when his scrambled eggs
and coffee is served. He looks the plate over carefully
and makes another note in his book before putting it
aside and beginning to eat. We can see that the earlier
edition will soon be filled with his markings: names
scratched out, others added, notes across the margins.
The WAITER hovers.

WAITER
And to drink?
MACON
Just coffee, please.
Decaffeinated.
WAITER
We have no decaffeinated.
MACON
(reacts)

Oh, you don't? Well, never mind.

The Waiter nods and retreats. Macon quickly makes a
disappointed note in his guidebook.

Macon leaves the “American Pancake House" and walks down 25
the block to the "American Steak House” and goes in. He
makes notes.

INT. PADDINGTON STATION - DAY 26

Macon buys a hot dog from a Vendor advertising "Genuine
American Hot Dogs" as London commuters stream by. Macon,
book and pen in hand, manages a bite of the mustard-
covered dog. He's not pleased.

OMITTED 27
INT. LONDON HOTELS (SERIES OF SHOTS)

Macon flushes the toilet in a cramped bathroom in an - 28
old hotel. A Nervous Manager tries to see what Macon
writes in his guidebook.

Another hotel manager, a Short Dapper Fellow, waits with 29
Macon for an elevator. And waits. The Short Dapper
Fellow becomes increasingly frenetic as the elevator

fails to arrive. Macon watches sympathetically.

THE ACCIDENTAL TOURIST - Rev. 12/14/87 16.

In the lobby of yet another place, Macon stands with a 30
dignified Lady Manager who looks like Margaret Thatcher.
Macon gazes at a covey of robed Arabs being served tea
across the room. A Bellhop pushes a cartload of new,

boxed Sony equipment to the elevator.

MACON
Has the hotel, ah, changed
ownership?

The Lady Manager lowers her eyes, distraught.

INT. MEOW-BOW ANIMAL HOSPITAL - DUSK 31

Macon stands alone at the counter and rings the service
bell. A GIRL with a ponytail pokes hér head through a
door.

MACON
I'm here for my dog.

GIRL
Your last name?

MACON
Leary.

GIRL

Oh. Just a minute.

The Girl disappears, and a moment later Muriel comes out.
She wears a V-necked black dress splashed with big pink
flowers and preposterously high-heeled sandals.

MURIEL
Well, hi there! How was your trip?

MACON
Oh, it was...where's Edward? Is
he all right?

MURIEL
Sure, he's all right. We just got
on like a house afire. Seems he
took a shine to me, I couldn't say
why.

MACON
Wonderful. So could I have him
back, please?

Caroline will bring him.

Muriel waits, facing him and wearing a perky smile.

MURIEL
Oh, yes. That'll be forty-two

Macon gives her a credit card. The length of her nails
makes working the embossing machine difficult. She turns
the bill in his direction.

MURIEL
Signature and phone.
(watches him sign)
Is that your home phone, or your
business?

MACON
It's both. Why? What difference
does it make?

MURIEL.
I was just wondering. I don't
know if I mentioned before that
it so happens I train dogs.

MACON
Is that right?

MURIEL
My speciality is dogs that bite.

MACON
Specialty. Webster prefers
"specialty."

She gives him a blank look.

MACON

That must be a dangerous job.

Oh, not for me! TI can handle

anything.

Biters, barkers, dogs that haven't
been treated right... even split
personality.

MACON

Split personality?

MURIEL
Where your dog is, like, nice to
you but kills all others... Not
that Edward would bite me, of
course. He just fell in love with
me, like I think I was telling you.

MACON
I'm glad to hear it.

MURIEL
But I could train him in no time
not to bite other people. You
think it over and call me. Muriel,
remember? Muriel Pritchett. Let
me give you my card.

She hands him a card.

MACON
Well, I'll bear that in mind.
Thank you very much.

MURIEL
Or just call for no reason! Call
and talk.

MACON
Talk?

MURIEL

Sure! Talk about Edward, his

Pick up the phone and just talk.
Don't you ever get the urge to do
that?

INT. MACON'S BEDROOM - MORNING 32

Coffee steams in the coffee maker and popcorn cools in
the popcorn maker, but Macon is still sleeping -- but
restlessly, without peace. The phone by the bed RINGS
loudly and Macon grabs it instantly, half-asleep.

MACON
Yeah?

ETHAN'S VOICE (ON PHONE)
Dad?

MACON
Ethan? Where are you?

ETHAN'S VOICE (ON PHONE)
I'm at camp, Dad. You never came

Why would you think that?

INT. MACON'S BEDROOM - MORNING 33
Macon wakes up for real now. It is a much slower

process. The phone RINGS twice more before he gets it.

On the line is JULIAN HEDGE, Macon's boss. To see him, *
we begin to INTERCUT with:

INT. JULIAN'S OFFICE (BUSINESSMAN'S PRESS) - MORNING 34

He makes it sound like the title of something.

JULIAN
So anyway, can I expect it by the
end of the month?

MACON
No... I'don't know.

Macon notices, to his surprise, that there are tears on
his cheeks. He wipes them.

JULIAN
Hey. Pal. Are you okay?

MACON

the manuscript in by the fifteenth.
Possibly earlier. Yes, very
possibly earlier.

Macon hangs up.

35 INT. MACON'S OFFICE - DAY 35

Macon's work materials are arranged about his typewriter.
Macon comes in in his gray sweatsuit and stands behind
his chair looking at the typewriter. He doesn't look so
good. He walks out.

Macon looks at it suspiciously -- he doesn't want any
more surprises. Finally, he picks it up.

MACON
Leary.

MURIEL (ON PHONE)
Macon? It's Muriel.

MACON
Muriel.

MURIEL (ON PHONE)
Muriel Pritchett.

We begin to INTERCUT:

INT. LIVING ROOM, MURIEL'S HOUSE - NIGHT 36A

Muriel sits on the couch in the living room of her
cramped row house. She holds the receiver with her chin
and shoulder so her hands are free to try on a variety of
press-on fingernails.

MACON
(still doesn't
remember)
Ah, yes.

MURIEL
From the vet's? Who got on so
good with your dog?

MACON
Right!

MURIEL
I was just wondering how Edward
was.

Macon glances over at Edward.

MACON
He looks all right to me.

MURIEL
No problems?

MACON
Well... he's developed this new
symptom. He gets angry if I leave
the house. He starts barking and
showing his teeth.

MACON
Oh, you know, he's four and a
half and I suppose --

MURIEL *
That's not too old! Tell you
what, maybe I could just come
around and discuss it.

MACON
Well, I really don't think --

MURIEL *
Or you could come to my place.
I'd fix you supper.
(silence)
Macon? What do you say?

Macon looks at the phone, confused.

MACON
I think for now I'll just try to
manage on my own.

MURIEL *
Well, I can understand that.
Believe me. I've been through
that stage. So what I'll do is,
I'll wait for you to get in touch.

MACON :
Yes. That would be good. Goodbye.

Macon is replacing the phone on its hook as he HEARS:
MURIEL *
I don't want to be pushy!
INT. MACON'S KITCHEN, TOP OF BASEMENT STAIRS - DAY 37
Edward stands WHIMPERING and shaking at the open door
to the basement, peering down into the gloom.
INT. BASEMENT - DAY 38
Macon is intently strapping the laundry basket we saw
earlier to a colorful skateboard -- Ethan's. Despite
some glimmer of satisfaction at his creation, Macon looks

worse than ever. Things are going downhill.

Macon glances up at Edward at the top of the stairs,
irritated.

MACON
If you want to come down, come.
Otherwise go away. But stop that
pitiful whimpering. This basement
is not haunted.

Macon stands to admire his work, pushing it across the
floor toward the laundry chute with his foot. .

. MACON
That ought to do nicely.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: . 38

Macon positions the rolling laundry basket under the
chute, opens the hatch and watches the squared-off stack
of laundry drop neatly into the basket. Macon pushes
the basket across the basement to the washing machine
and puts the laundry inside. He starts the machine; it
SHAKES violently and GRUMBLES into operation. He takes
a load from the dryer, drops it in the basket and gives
it a kick across the floor. It rolls to a stop at the
bottom of the stairs.

Macon stands where he was, as if transfixed, lost in
space. After a long moment, he snaps out of it.

MACON
: (to himself)
Buck up.

He walks over to the stairs and is about to pick up the
dry clothes when his attention is drawn to the WHIMPERING
Edward, who, despite his terror, has made his way hesi-
tantly down two steps. Macon is a bit cheered by this
and puts out his arms encouragingly.

MACON
That's the stuff, Edward. Come on.
Nothing to be afraid of here.

Edward quakes down two more steps, WHINING, then loses
his resolve. Macon moves up a step toward him, arms
open.

MACON
Don't give up, Edward. We can
make it. Come on. We're both
going to make Ethan proud.

At that instant the washing machine goes out of balance
and begins to ROCK WILDLY, emitting a horrendous SCREECH-
ING NOISE.

Edward's eyes widen. He leaps from his spot into Macon's
chest and arms. Macon, looking at the washing machine,
takes the clawed legs in his diaphragm and steps back
into empty space. One foot lands in the laundry basket,
which immediately rolls out from under him. Macon goes
down hard.

Edward scampers up to the top of the stairs, YELPING
wildly, and stands looking back down at --

Macon, in agony, sprawled on the floor, his leg stuck
out behind him at an impossible angle. His eyelids
flicker as he looks up the stairs.

endless staircase. The little dog begins to FADE TO
BLACK.

FADE IN:

INT. DINING ROOM (ROSE'S HOUSE) - NIGHT 39

We're looking at a large framed portrait on the wall.
It is the Leary siblings as children: Macon in the
center, his older brothers PORTER and CHARLES on either
side, and, perched in the foreground, his sister ROSE.
A LITTLE MOVE OF THE CAMERA reveals them now, thirty
years older, eating dinner.

All four are intently preparing their baked potatoes.
They have scooped out the insides and filled the skins
with butter. The floury insides are mashed and seasoned
separately.

Macon's leg is in a cast to his hip.

MACON.
I don't think anyone else has any
idea where I am.

PORTER
What do you mean?

MACON
I mean that I've come to stay
over here with you for a while.

CHARLES
Does it matter?

Macon considers.

ROSE
Do you think you should tell
Sarah?
MACON
(no)

It's nice to be so unconnected.
I wish things could stay that way
a while.

CHARLES
Why can't they?

MACON
Oh, well, you know, someone will

call here, Sarah or someone --

PORTER .

Why not?
MACON

Not answer it any time?

ROSE
Most who call me are neighbors.
They'll pop over in person if
they don't get an answer.

CHARLES
I won't miss it.

Macon looks at Porter, who shakes his head, "no problem."

INT. SUN PORCH (ROSE'S HOUSE) - NIGHT 40

The four siblings sit at an ancient card table playing a
card game of their own invention called Vaccination.
Macon is the only one not totally concentrated on the
cards. His gaze moves from brother to sister to brother
with the same interest they lavish on their cards.
Something about this makes him a little uneasy.

The telephone in the living room RINGS. Nobody seems
to notice. Rose lays a king on Porter's queen.

PORTER
Stinker.

ROSE
Hypodermic.

Rose lays a king on the ace. Charles reacts, WHISTLING
-- excited for him, which is not much. Macon smiles.

PORTER
You're a real stinker, Rose.
MACON

his hand)

: MACON'S V.O.
Generally food in England is not
as jarring as in other foreign
countries. Nice cooked vegetables,
things in white sauce... I don't
know why some travelers complain
about English food. ~

He hears yelling from the front of the house.

JULIAN 0O.S.
Help! Help! Call off your dog.

Macon props himself on his crutches and makes his way to
the window, in the front parlor.

INT./EXT. PARLOR - FRONT YARD - DAY 42

MACON'S POV: Edward has someone treed in the giant
magnolia to the right of the walk; he's BARKING and
popping off. the ground. .

JULIAN

(somewhere in
branches)

Call him off, dammit!

MACON
Edward! Stop that!

EXT. FRONT YARD AND PORCH - DAY 43
Macon struggles down the porch steps and hops over to the
magnolia. He manages to lean over and grab the leash
Edward is trailing. He peers up into the tree.

MACON
Who is that?

JULIAN
This is your employer, Macon.

MACON
Julian?

Julian lowers himself from the magnolia. He has a line of
dirt across the front of his light slacks.

MACON
Well, I'm sorry about this. I

Porter.
JULIAN

What happened to your leg?
MACON

I broke it.
JULIAN

Well, I see that, but how?

MACON
It's kind of hard to explain.

Julian supports Macon as they climb the steps.
JULIAN

Do you know how late you're
running with this guidebook?

downtown.
JULIAN
You've split.
Macon nods.
JULIAN

Jesus, Macon, what went wrong?

MACON
Nothing. It turns out these
things can happen for no
particular reason.

Edward suddenly flies into the hall BARKING furiously.
The front door swings open, hitting the radiator.

ROSE 0.S.
Hush, now.

Rose crosses the hall and looks into the parlor. Julian
gets to his feet. Charles comes in behind Rose.

MACON
Julian Hedge, this is my sister,
Rose. And this is my brother,
Charles.

Neither Rose nor Charles can shake hands; they are hug-
ging brown paper bags full of groceries. They greet
Julian.

JULIAN
Macon Leary with a sister! And a
brother, too. Who'd have guessed
it? That Macon Leary had a family
just never entered my mind, somehow.

MACON

I'm right here, Julian.
Rose gives Julian a polite, puzzled smile.

JULIAN
Oh, yes.

ROSE
I'm supposed to send you some more,
but first.I have to buy nine-by-
twelve envelopes. All we've got
left is ten-by-thirteen. It's
terrible when things don't fit
precisely. They get all out of
alignment.

JULIAN
Ah.

Julian looks at Rose for a very long moment, fascinated.

MACON
We wouldn't want to keep you, Rose.

ROSE
Oh! No.

She smiles at Julian, hoists her groceries higher, and
leaves the room. Charles slogs after her.

JULIAN
The Macon Leary Nine-by-Twelve
Envelope Crisis.

MACON
Oh, Julian, drop it.

JULIAN
Really, I had no idea, Macon. I
mean, if you'd let me know what
was going on in your life... Look.
If you want another, I don't know,
another month --

Macon gets up and hobbles off toward the sun porch.

MACON
Oh, nonsense, what's a missing
wife or two, right? Here, let

The front door BANGS open again and Edward begins bark-

without a glance into the parlor.

PORTER
(to Edward)
Monster. Do you know how long
I've been looking for you?

Julian is looking after him with a bemused smile when
Macon drops the manuscript gently in his lap. Macon sits
back down on the sofa as Julian begins to read. The
telephone begins to RING over and over; no one answers.

Julian locks at Macon and raises his eyebrows. But since
no one else seems to hear the RINGING, Julian goes back
to his reading.

MOVING IN on Macon as he watches Julian and remembers --

INT. OLD BAY RESTAURANT (FLASHBACK) - DAY 45

Macon and Julian, having just met, sit at a small table
in the conservative seafood restaurant.

JULIAN
Here's my plan. I own this little
company called the Businessman's
Press. Well, little: I say
little. Actually we sell coast
to coast. And now I want to put
out a guidebook for commercial
travelers. We'd call it something
catchy, I don't know: Reluctant
Tourist... And you're the fellow
to write it.

MACON
Me?

JULIAN
I knew the minute I read your hot
dog essay in the Baltimore Sun.

MACON
That was a one time thing. I work
in the family business. I'm not
really a writer.

JULIAN
I think you are.

JULIAN
I thought so. So do businessmen.

So you'll be helping them pretend
that's where they are.

Julian pulls a square of paper from his breast pocket
and flattens it on the table.

JULIAN
What do you think?

It is an engraving of the winged armchair we know as
Macon's logo.

JULIAN
Your logo. Get it?

MACON
Um...

JULIAN

While armchair travelers dream of
going places, traveling armchairs
dream of staying put! I thought
we'd use this on the cover.

MACON
Ah! But would I actually have to
travel myself?

JULIAN
Well, yes.
MACON
(disappointed)
Oh.
JULIAN

But just briefly. I don't want
too much information. I'm not
looking for anything encyclopedic.
I'm looking for the opposite of
encyclopedic.

MACON
Oh.
(pause)
What is the opposite?

Macon watches as Julian restacks the manuscript pages.

JULIAN
After this I want to start on New
York and the northeast again.

MACON
So soon?

It's been three years, Macon.

Julian stands up, and, with some difficulty, Macon does
too.

47 INT./EXT. FRONT HALL - DOORWAY - DAY 47
When they reach the front door, Edward blocks it, BARKING.

MACON
Edward, stop it.

Macon gives one crutch to Julian and bends to grasp
Edward's leash. Edward turns and SNARLS at Macon.

JULIAN
Whoa!

Edward SNAPS at his leash with an audible CLICK. Then
he SNAPS at Macon's hand. Macon steps back and drops
the leash. The other crutch CLATTERS to the floor.

JULIAN
Macon? Did he get you?

Macon looks down at his hand. There are four red
puncture marks in the fleshy party. Julian gives him
his crutches, keeping one eye on Edward.

JULIAN
I wouldn't have a dog like that.
I'd shoot him.

MACON
He's never done that.

JULIAN
I'd call the S.P.C.A. Or the
what's-it, dogcatcher. Tell them
you want him done away with.

fronted cupboard, accepting the groceries that Charles
and Porter hand up to her.

: ROSE
Now I need the n's, anything
starting with n.

PORTER
How about these noodles? N for
noodles? P for pasta?

ROSE
E for elbow macaroni. You might
have passed those up earlier,
Porter. -

Macon comes hobbling in. Edward follows shyly.
MACON
Rose? It seems Edward's given me
a little sort of nip.

The siblings stop work to examine his hand.

ROSE
Oh, Macon!

CHARLES
How did it happen?

MACON

It was an accident, that's all.
But I think I need an antiseptic.

You need a tetanus shot, too.

remembering--

INT./EXT. MACON'S HOUSE - SERIES OF SHOTS (FLASHBACK)

In_the living room, we're CLOSE ON a jumping Edward. As 49
he retreats, we see the laughing face of Ethan, the dog's
wrestling adversary. The dog comes back for another go.

In the kitchen, Sarah's legs WIPE PAST Ethan sitting 50
on the floor gently brushing a becalmed Edward.

In the backyard, TRACKING WITH a soccer ball as it rolls 51
across the lawn. Edward catches up to it, crazed, and
shoulders into the hedge, GROWLING ferociously. Across
the yard, Ethan watches delighted, head thrown back, his
laughter high and clear, but seeming now to grow EVER MORE
DISTANT. He turns TO LOOK AT CAMERA, at what must be --

INT. KITCHEN, ROSE'S HOUSE (BACK TO PRESENT) 52

they avert their eyes tactfully, kindly.

MACON

INT. /EXT. ENTRANCE HALL - DAY ° 53

Edward is sitting on the floor. His rump wiggles from
his desire to stand up. He is looking up expectantly
at--

Muriel Pritchett, who stands above him as Macon, on
crutches, watches. Muriel makes a CLUCKING sound with
her tongue and holds out her hand.

. MURIEL

Now you kind of cluck your tongue.
They get to know a cluck means
praise. And when I hold my hand
out -- see? That means he has to
stay.

Edward stays, but a YELP erupts from him every few
seconds. Finally, Muriel snaps her fingers over Edward's
head. Edward jumps up, BARKING.

MURIEL
(to dog)
That was very good.

Muriel reaches into her purse and pulls out a long blue
leash attached to a choke chain. She slips the choke
chain over Edward's head. :

MURIEL
He's supposed to wear this every
minute till he's trained. That
way you can yank him back whenever
he does something wrong.

She takes a step back and points to Edward's rump.
Edward stands fast.

MURIEL
Poke him down.

Macon props a crutch against the radiator and bends
stiffly to jab Edward with one finger. Edward sits.
Macon CLUCKS. Then he straightens and backs away, hold-
ing out his palm. But instead of staying, Edward rises
and follows him. Muriel HISSES between her teeth.
Edward shrinks down again.

to people's houses. Doggie, Do,
it was called. Don't you just
hate that name? But anyhow, I
answered the ad. I told them that
to be honest, I didn't like animals
but Mr. Quarles, the owner, he
told me that was just as well.
He told me it was people who got

A damp, drippy morning. Muriel and Macon are in rain-
coats. Muriel is teaching Edward to "heel." Macon
struggles along on his crutches.

She starts walking. Edward follows uncertainly.

MURIEL
He's supposed to match his pace to
anything. Slow, fast, anything I do.

She speeds up and Edward scurries after her. Edward
crosses in front of her and Muriel walks right into him,
kicking him. When he dawdles, she yanks his leash. Soon
Edward is keeping close to Muriel's left side.

MURIEL
I think he's got the hang of it.
Now you.

Macon attempts to slap his hip without losing his crutches.
Then he sets off. Edward keeps pulling ahead.

MURIEL
Yank that leash! He knows what he's
supposed to do. Don't forget to cluck.
Every little minute, you have to praise
him.

talk. That's a promise.

Muriel trills her fingers at him, and clicks off toward
a car parked down the street -- an aged, gray, boat-like
sedan. She slides in and slams the door -- there is a
sound like falling beer cans. The engine TWANGS and
RATTLES before it takes hold. Macon watches her go.

MACON'S V.O.

{same guidebook tone)
It is an unfortunate fact that
even the most conscientious
traveler cannot be prepared for
every encounter. At such times,
one must remain calm and rely
upon one's innate common sense.

Macon, on crutches, leans down to speak to Rose once more
before she drives away.

MACON
Are you absolutely clear about
this?

Yes. I know exactly where we are.

Besides, I have the address right
here! I'll be back in one half
hour.

You're sure?

ROSE

MACON
We're really not much for

happily around her. Muriel has a gauzy bouffant scarf
over her hair. She points at Edward's rump. The dog
sits and Muriel picks up his leash.

MACON
How's your little boy?

Muriel looks over at Macon.

MURIEL
What?

MACON
Wasn't he sick?

MURIEL
Who told you that?

MACON
Someone at the vet's, when I
phoned. They said your little
boy was sick.

She goes on looking at him.

MACON
What was it? The flu? It's that
time of year, I guess.

MURIEL
How come you phoned?

MACON
I wanted to know why Edward
wouldn't lie down.

She turns her gaze toward Edward.
MACON

I tap my foot but he never obeys
me. Something's wrong.

MURIEL
I told you he'd be stubborn about
it.

MACON

Yes, but I've been practicing
two days now and he's not --

MURIEL
What do you expect? You think
I'm magical or something? Why
blame me?

MACON
Oh, I'm not blaming --

MURIEL
You most certainly are. You tell
me something's wrong, you call me
on the phone --

MACON
I just-wanted to --

MURIEL
You think it's weird I didn't
mention Alexander, don't you? You
think I'm some kind of unnatural
mother.

MACON
What? No, wait a minute --

MURIEL
You're not going to give me
another thought, are you, now you
know I've got a kid. You're like,
"Oh, forget it, no point getting
involved in that."

As Muriel's voice grows shriller, the hair on Edward's
neck begins to stand up. The dog's lip begins to curl
and he starts a low GROWL.

MURIEL :
You wonder why I didn't tell you
about Alexander right off. Well,
isn't it obvious? Don't you see
what happens when I do?

Muriel looks down at the dog and stops speaking. She
taps her foot twice, but Edward rises from his sitting
position, a distinct hump between his shoulders.

MURIEL
Down.

With a BELLOW, Edward springs at her fate, every tooth
bare and gleaming. Muriel instantly raises the leash.

. He stops barking and starts
making GARGLING SOUNDS.

MACON
He's choking. Stop it. It's
enough. You're choking him!

Still, she lets him hang. Now Edward's eyes roll back
in their sockets. Macon grabs at Muriel's shoulder.
Muriel lowers Edward to the floor. He lands in a bone-
less heap. Macon crouches at his side.

MACON
Edward? Edward? Oh God, he's
dead!

Edward raises his head and feebly licks his lips.
MURIEL
See that? When they lick their
lips it's a sign they're giving
in. Doggie, Do taught me that.

Macon stands up, shaking.

MACON
Don't you ever, ever do that again.
MURIEL
Huh?
MACON
In fact, don't even bother coming
again.

There is a startled silence.

MURIEL
(tightening scarf)
Well, fine. If that's the way
you feel, just fine and dandy.

She steps neatly around Edward and opens the front door.

MURIEL
You want a dog you can't handle?
Fine with me.

MACON
I'd rather a barking dog than a
damaged, timid dog.

. MURIEL
You want a dog that bites all your
friends? You want an evil, nasty
dog? That kills the whole world?

She slips. out the screen door and closes it behind her.
Then she looks through the screen directly into Macon's
eyes.

From the hall floor, Edward gives a MOAN.

INT./EXT. ENTRANCE HALL - NIGHT

CAMERA IS LOCKED from the previous scene as daylight
fades and the porchlight comes on and suddenly Julian,
yet another outsider, is at the Leary's screen door and
Rose is admitting him. Edward BARKS from behind some
nearby door,

JULIAN
(a little shy)
Hello, Rose.

ROSE
(pleased)
Hello, Julian. Come in.
JULIAN
I've brought some materials for

Macon.

Just then Macon appears, with Charles close behind.

JULIAN
I hope I'm not interfering with
supper.
ROSE
No, no.
MACON
(eyes him
suspiciously)
We've finished.
JULIAN
(disappointed;

looks at watch)
Really? What time do you eat,
anyhow?

ROSE
But we haven't had our coffee.
Wouldn't you like some coffee?

JULIAN
I'd love some.

It seems a little silly if you
haven't eaten.

61 INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT . 61
Rose leads the group into the living room.

JULIAN
For me, home-brewed coffee is a
real treat. All the people in
my apartment building eat out,
and there's nothing in any of the
kitchens but a couple cans of
peanuts and some diet soda.

ROSE
What kind of place is that?
JULIAN
It's the Calvert Arms -- a singles
building. Everybody's single.
ROSE
Oh! What an interesting idea.
JULIAN
(gloomily)

Well, not really. Sometimes I
wish for the old-fashioned way of
doing things, with children and
old people like normal buildings
have.

ROSE
Well, of course you do. I'm going -
to get you some nice hot coffee.

Rose leaves and Julian watches her out of the room. Macon
watches him watch, They sit down.

JULIAN
Where is Porter?

CHARLES
We're not too sure. He went to
a hardware store and we think he

- got lost.
JULIAN
Good grief, when did this happen?
CHARLES
A little while before supper.

Macon gets up.

Never mind. I'11 go help Rose.

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT 62

Rose is setting coffee mugs on a silver tray. Edward
makes a racket behind the pantry door.

ROSE
Julian seems very nice.

MACON
He's only here because he hopes
we'll do something eccentric. I
just pray none of us says anything
unconventional around hin.

ROSE

tray)
What would we say? We're the most
conventional people I know.

Oh, well, it's not half as
exciting as it sounds, really.

JULIAN
And Rose? Do you work?

ROSE
Yes, I do. I work at home. I
keep house for the boys. Also
I take care of a lot of the older
neighbors. They need me to repair
their plumbing and such.

JULIAN
You repair their plumbing?

The telephone RINGS. The Learys stiffen and exchange

ROSE
What do you think? It could be

MACON

But he knows we wouldn't answer.
ROSE

Macon shoots a glance at the others and turns his back to

SARAH (ON PHONE)
Well, finally. I've been trying
to get in touch with you at home.

MACON
Is something wrong?

SARAH (ON PHONE)
(after moment )
I called because I thought we
should talk. I was hoping we
could meet for supper some night.

MACON
Oh. Well. Yes, we could do that.

The hostess seats Macon at a corner table.

HOSTESS
(indicating crutches)
I'll take those for you, darlin’.

MACON
Oh, they'll be fine here.

HOSTESS
I need to check them up front,
sweetheart. It's a rule.

MACON
You have a rule about crutches?

HOSTESS -

customers, honeybunch.

Sarah appears beside the table. Macon half stands. ” She

She looks

MACON
Hasn't it?
SARAH

I asked you here for a reason,
Macon. We need to spell out the
details of our separation.

MACON
I think you ought to come home.

SARAH
It's not possible.

MACON

. Listen. Don't say no before you

hear me out. Have you ever
considered we might have another
baby?

Sarah is taken aback. Macon has shocked himself, too.

MACON
Why not? We're not too old.
SARAH
Oh, Macon.
MACON
I realize we can't replace Ethan,
but -~
SARAH
No.

Her tone is definitive.

SARAH
I'm sorry. But it would never
work.
MACON

All right, forget that. It was
erazy, right? Crazy notion. All
I'm saying is...I think we ought
to start over.

SARAH

I am starting over. I'm doing
everything I can to start over,
but that doesn't mean I want to
live the same life twice.

(leans toward him)
Macon, we really didn't have much
left, don't you see. Look who you
turned to when you broke your leg:
your family! You're closer to
them than you ever were to me.

MACON
That's not true. Or rather, maybe
it's true in the sense we're blood
relations.

SARAH
Yes, blood. Playing that
ridiculous card game no one else
can fathom. Cruising hardware
stores like other people cruise
boutiques.

MACON
As other people cruise boutiques.

Macon immediately regrets it.

SARAH
Picking apart people's English.
Have to have their precious baked
potatoes every night. The best
house in the world might come on
the market, but you can't buy it
because you've ordered these

address labels for the old house, |

one thousand five hundred gummed
labels, and you have to-use them
up before you move.

Macon lays down his fork.

MACON
Sarah, it's what happened to
Ethan that ruined us.

Sarah sets an elbow on the table and covers her eyes.

MACON
But it doesn't have to. Why, some
people, a thing like this brings
them closer together. How come
we're ietting it tear us apart?

Sarah looks up. Her eyes are deep with tears, but they
haven't spilled over.

SARAH
Macon, ever since Ethan died I've
had to admit that people are
basically bad. Evil, Macon. So
evil they would take a twelve-year- .
old boy and shoot him through the
skull for no reason. I've given
up watching the news on TV.
There's so much wickedness.

Tears are running down her face now.

MACON
It's true what you say about human
beings. I'm not trying to argue.
But tell me this, Sarah. Why
would that cause you to leave me?

She crumples up her napkin and dabs at her face.

SARAH
Because I knew you wouldn't try to
argue. You've believed all along
they were evil.

MACON
Well, so --

SARAH
This whole last year I felt myself
withdrawing from people. Just
like you do, Macon -- just as you
do, sorry. I felt I was turning
into a Leary.

MACON
There are worse disasters than
that, I guess.

SARAH
I can't afford it. I live in this
apartment you'd hate, all clutter.
I've made a whole bunch of new
friends, and you wouldn't like
them much either, I guess. I'm
studying sculpture again. I always
did want to be a sculptor, only
teaching seemed more sensible.
That's how you would think:
sensible. You're so quick to be
sensible, Macon, that you've given
up on just about everything.

Everything that might touch you
or upset you or disrupt you.

MACON
I'm sitting here with you, Sarah.
You don't see me giving up on you.

She chooses not to hear this.

SARAH
When Ethan died, you emptied his
closet and his bureau as if you
couldn't be rid of him soon enough.
You kept offering people his junk
in the basement, stilts and sleds
and skateboards, and you couldn't
understand why they didn't accept
them. Macon, I know you loved him
but I can't help thinking you
didn't love him as much as I did,
you're not so torn apart by his
going.

Macon reacts to that with an infinitesimal flinch. Sarah
sees it, but drives on --

SARAH
I know you mourned him but there's
something so... what-do-you-call,
so... muffled about the way you
experience things. It's like
you're trying to slip through life
unchanged.

MACON
Sarah, I'm not muffled. I...
endure. I'm trying to endure,
I'm holding steady.

SARAH
If you really think that, then
you're fooling yourself. You're
encased. You're like something
in a capsule. Macon, I'm sorry,
but it's not by chance you write
those silly books telling people
how to take trips without a jolt.
So they can go to the most
wonderful, exotic places and never
be touched by them, never feel
they've left home! That traveling
armchair isn't just your logo --
it's you.

He's an attorney.

She changes her mind about whatever she was going to say.
She stands up and walks out. Macon watches her go, then,
very carefully, begins to eat.

INT. OLD BAY RESTAURANT - NIGHT 66

LATER. The Waitress carries a set of crutches to the
waiting Macon. He gets up on them and begins to make
his way across the busy dining room. He has to walk
nearly doubled, his chin sunk low on his chest and his
elbows jutting. His posture perfectly matches his mood.
But some of the other Diners are staring; some SNICKER.
He passes two churchy OLD LADIES and one of them tugs at
his sleeve.

OLD LADY
Sir? Sir?
He comes to a stop.

OLD LADY
I suspect they may have given you
my crutches. .

He looks down at the crutches. They are diminutive --
hardly more than child-sized. He stands hanging his head,
waiting for someone to help him.

A taxi pulls up to the curb and Macon gets out, treating

A hostess leads Macon across the spacious, candlelit dark-
ness that is the dining room. Great black windows en-
circle the room from floor to ceiling, but Macon is taken
to a table without a view.

Macon's WAITER hands him a menu.

MACON
Dry sherry, please.

As soon as the Waiter leaves, Macon folds his menu in
two and sits on it. The Waiter returns with the sherry.

WHAT MACON SEES. At first just the darkness, with the 71
lights of New Jersey at the bottom of his field of

vision. Then, just barely emerging from the gloom, an
image of --

with a smile to look at Macon, who --

She's out. Julian came to take
her to dinner and --

Julian?

CHARLES
Isn't that his name?

MACON
Julian my boss?

CHARLES
Yes, and Edward went into one of
his fits. So Rose said "Quick,
shut him in the pantry.” So I
grabbed his leash and he turned
on me and nearly took my hand off.
So I shut myself in the pantry
instead and Rose must have left
by then and Porter's out...

Macon places his hand over his heart for a moment;

the beating seems wrong.

CHARLES
If you don't get me out of this

Macon hangs up and takes his wallet from his pocket. He
sifts despairingly through the numbers in his wallet.
Then he sees the name: Muriel Pritchett. The card is

larger piece of paper. He punches the numbers.

York and I'm having this kind of,

MACON -
You're making too much out of it.
It's nothing, really.

realize what you went through
before you stepped into the
elevator. See, underneath you
said, "Okay, I'll trust it." Why,

that building so amazed and proud
of yourself!

Macon gives a small, dry laugh and grips the receiver
more tightly.

I'm going to go get Edward and
take him to the Meow-Bow. Then
when you get back from your trip,
we need to talk about his training.
I mean, things just can't go on
this way, Macon.

MURIEL
See you, then. ‘Bye.

MACON
Wait -- Muriel!

But she is gone. Macon hangs up. He turns and sees a
TEEN COUPLE coming down the corridor from the elevator.
The girl's dress is clumsy and touching, her chin hidden
by a monstrous orchid. Halfway down the corridor, the
couple stops to gaze around at the wondrous surroundings,
and at each other.

BOY
Hoo!

He grabs both the girl's hands and kisses them, then
leads her past Macon into the restaurant. Macon watches
for a moment -- soothed -- and then follows them inside.

INT. ENTRANCE HALL/LIVING ROOM, ROSE'S HOUSE - DAY 84

Macon watches Muriel as she stands over Edward, who lays
squirming on the hall rug.

MURIEL .

I'll be honest, my baby was not
exactly planned for. If you want
to know the truth, the baby was
the reason we got married.

(checks Macon's

reaction, then

indicates the dog)
Now I'm going to turn my back, and
you watch how he does.

Muriel wanders into the living room. She lifts a vase
from a table and examines its underside. She sits on
the couch and raises one foot in front of her, turning
it admiringly this way and that. Her stocking bags at
the ankle; she pulls it up.

MURIEL
Pretty soon he'll lie like that
for three hours straight.

MACON
Three hours? Isn't that sort of
cruel?
. MURIEL
I thought you promised not to talk
like that. ~

MACON
Right. Sorry.

Muriel comes back into the entrance hall and directly up
to Macon in a way that makes him back away involuntarily.
He just misses stepping on Edward.

MURIEL
My son's name is Alexander. Did
I tell you that? Something went
wrong while I was carrying him
and they had to do a Caesarean
and take him out early and I
can't ever have any more children.
Alexander was so teeny he didn't
even look like a human, and he
had to stay in an incubator
forever, just about, and nearly
died. Norman -- that's my
ex-husband -- he said, "When's
it going to look like other
babies?" Norman always called
Alexander "it."

Edward WHIMPERS. He is just barely lying down -- his
haunches braced, his claws digging into the carpet.

MURIEL
Maybe you and Alexander should
get together some time.

MACON
Oh, I, ah....

MURIEL
He doesn't have enough men in his
life. Maybe the three of us
could go to a movie. Do you ever
go to movies?

MACON
I really don't care for movies.
They make everything seem so close
up.

behind. He turns on the light above the stove and
squints at the oven dial.

Charles walks in, wearing large, floppy pajamas. He too
peers at the oven dial. He sighs and opens the oven
door. Both brothers look inside.

WHAT THEY SEE: A huge turkey, cooking at very slow heat,
looks a little like Macon's leg when it came out of the
cast.

CHARLES
Two quarts of stuffing. I heard
her say so. Two quarts of teeming,
swarming bacteria.

MACON
(serious)
Is this the Thanksgiving we all
die?

INT. KITCHEN - MORNING 86

Macon comes in. Rose is cheerily serving Charles
pancakes.

MACON
Rose, what exactly is it you're
doing to this turkey?

ROSE
I told you: slow heat. Jam,
Charles, or syrup? See, I read
an article about slow-cooked beef
and I thought, well, if it works
with beef it must work with turkey,
too. But at the end I'm going to
raise the temperature.

CHARLES
You'd have to raise it mighty
high.

MACON

You'd have to expose it to a
nuclear flash.

ROSE
Well, you're both just plain wrong.
Who's the cook here anyhow?

INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT . 87

Thanksgiving dinner. The table is laden with attractive
side dishes. In addition to the Leary brothers, there
are two guests -- Julian and MRS. BARRETT, one of their
elderly neighbors. They look expectantly toward the
kitchen door.

Rose enters holding the turkey high on a platter as if in
triumph. Odd since the bird looks bad, its breast caved
in, its skin dry and dull.

MRS. BARRETT
Ah!

JULIAN
I just wish my neighbors could
see this.

MACON

There may be a little problem here.
Rose sets the turkey down and glares at him.

MACON
Of course, the rest of the meal
is excellent. Why, we could fill
up on the vegetables alone! In
fact I think I'll do that. But
the turkey...

CHARLES
It's pure poison.

JULIAN
Come again?

MACON

We think it may have been cooked
at a slightly inadequate

temperature.
ROSE

It was not! It's perfectly good.
MACON

Mrs. Barrett, maybe you'd rather

you want me to waste mine, but I

what! Love is what it's all about.
And you want to make me miss it!

MACON
Well, goodness.

ROSE
You just don't want me to stop
cooking for you and taking care
of this house. You don't want
Julian to fall in love with me.

There is a MURMUR around the table; everyone looks
unhappy.

MRS. BARRETT

Julian? Potato?

JULIAN
I'll take the turkey.

Macon is stopped for a moment. He looks at Julian in a
new way. And he likes him.

EXT. SIDEWALK, ROSE'S NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY 88

Muriel and Macon are walking with Edward, training him
not to chase cyclists.

MURIEL
Norman couldn't understand why
I was all the time at the hospital
visiting Alexander. He was in
for months. You should have seen
our medical bills. Finally I took
a job at the hospital. I got a
kind of, like a maid's job,
emptying trash cans, wet-mopping
floors...

MURIEL
Now, act like we expect no trouble.

The Girl skims by them. Edward sniffs the breeze but
marches on,

MACON
Edward, that was wonderful!

Muriel just CLUCKS.
- MURIEL

They finally did let Alexander
come home. Cried like a kitten
would cry. And Norman would get
this kind of stubborn look
whenever I had to do something,
go warm a bottle or something.
I'd be hanging over the crib
watching Alexander fight for air,
and Norman would call, "Muriel?
Commercial's just about over!"

Macon watches her..

MURIEL
And then one day Norman's mother
came over to help him pack his
clothes and he left me.

She slows and then comes to a stop. Edward, with a
martyred sigh, sits down at her heel.

MURIEL
All that time Alexander was in
the hospital seemed so awful, but
now when I look back, I almost
miss it. I mean there was
something cozy about it. I think
about those nurses gossiping at
the nurses' station and those rows
of little babies sleeping. It was
winter and sometimes I'd stand at
a window and look out and I'd
feel happy to be warm and safe.
I'd look down at the emergency
room entrance and watch the
ambulances coming in. You ever
wonder what a Martian might think
if he happened to land near an
emergency room?

MURIEL (CONT'D)
He'd see an ambulance whizzing in
and everybody running out to meet
it, tearing the doors open,
grabbing up the stretcher, scurrying
along with it. "Why," he'd say,
“what a helpful planet, what kind
and helpful creatures." He'd never
guess we're not always that way,
that we had to, oh, put aside our
natural selves to do it. "What a
helpful race of beings," a Martian
would say. Don't you think so?

She looks up at Macon. Macon experiences a sudden twist
in his chest. He bends and kisses her, surprising them
both. Her fist with the leash in it is caught between
them like a stone. Macon draws back.

MACON
Well...

She goes on looking at him.

MACON
Sorry.

They turn and walk back toward Rose's in silence.

INT. STUDY, ROSE'S HOUSE - NIGHT 89

Rose is knitting Julian a sweater. Macon, a book in
his lap, watches her needles flashing.

MACON
Actually, have you ever noticed
that Julian wears crew necks?

ROSE.
That doesn't mean he wouldn't
wear a V-neck if he had one.

MACON
You know, he's younger. I don't
know if you realize that.

ROSE
Two years.

MACON

you. It's wrong, you know, what
you said at Thanksgiving. Love
is not what it's all about. There
are all kinds of other issues.

ROSE
He ate my turkey and did not get
sick. Two big helpings.

Macon looks pained. He has no answer to that.

INT. MURIEL'S CAR - DAY 90

Muriel is driving her long gray boat of a car. Macon
sits beside her. Edward is in back, his ears horizontal
with joy as he sticks his head out the window.

MURIEL
I got this car for only two
hundred dollars. That's because
it needed work. But I took it to
Dominick, this boy down the street
from where I live. I said,
“Dominick, here's the deal. You
fix my car up, I let you have the
use of it three nights a week and
all day Sunday." Wasn't that a
good idea?

MACON
Very inventive.

INT. /EXT. GROCERY STORE - SIDEWALK - DAY 91

Macon approaches the big window in front as though
sneaking up on someone. He stops and looks.

MACON'S POV. Edward is sitting obediently out on the
sidewalk. Now Macon's gaze shifts down the sidewalk two
car lengths. Muriel is leaning against the fender of her
car making faces into a brown plastic compact. She
barely glances in Edward's direction.

CLOSE ON Macon as he stares at Muriel.

EXT. GROCERY STORE - SIDEWALK - DAY ~ 92

Macon comes out of the grocery store and goes over to
pat and CLUCK over Edward.

MURIEL
Give him lots of praise!

Muriel leads them next door to a drugstore and motions
for Edward to "stay."

. MURIEL
This time we'll both go in.
MACON
Is it safe?
MURIEL
We'll have to try it sooner or
later.
INT. DRUGSTORE - DAY 93

Macon and Muriel stroll back to the cosmetics counter.
Macon keeps looking toward the front. Muriel stops to
try on a lipstick.

MURIEL
Too pink. What are you doing for
dinner tomorrow night?

For dinner?

MURIEL

The RECEPTIONIST is a gray-haired woman. Muriel sits
reading a magazine. Macon raises one of the slats of

the venetian blinds to check on Edward sitting on the
sidewalk outside.

MACON .
How old did you say Alexander was?
MURIEL
He's seven. Have you thought?
MACON
Hmm?
MURIEL

Have you given any thought to
coming to dinner?

MACON
Oh. ‘Well, I could come. If it's
only for dinner.

MURIEL
What else would it be for?

She smiles up at him and tosses her hair back.

RECEPTIONIST
Here he is.

ALEXANDER comes out. He is a small, white, sickly boy
with a shaved-looking skull. His eyes are magnified
behind large spectacles whose clear frames have a pinkish
cast. He wears a carefully coordinated shirt-and-slacks
set such as only a mother would choose.

MURIEL
Sweetie, this is Macon. Can you
say hi?

_ Macon holds out his hand. After a moment, Alexander

shakes it weakly.

doctor's without your mother.

Muriel takes care of the bill at the counter, with cash.

MURIEL
He's allergic to shellfish, milk,
eggs, and most vegetables. Also,
dust, pollen and paint, and we
think maybe he's allergic to air.
Whenever he's outside a long time
he gets these bumps on any
uncovered parts of his body.

INT. MURIEL'S CAR - DAY . 95

Alexander rides next to Muriel. Macon sits in back with
Edward.

MURIEL
Alexander is subject to asthma,
exzema, and nosebleeds. If a bee
ever stings him and he hasn't had
his shots he could be dead in half
an hour.

Alexander turns his head slowly and gazes at Macon.

INT. DINING ROOM, ROSE'S HOUSE - NIGHT 96

Macon sits alone with a box of good stationery and pen
in hand. He has rejected several attempts. Now he tries
again --

MACON'S V.0O.
Dear Muriel --

He lifts the pen. Finally, he begins to write again.

: MACON'S V.O.
I am very sorry, but I won't be
able to have dinner with you after
all.

he seems inspired and writes --

MACON'S V.O.
Regretfully, Macon.

He lays down the pen.

EXT. MURIEL'S NEIGHBORHOOD (SERIES OF SHOTS) - NIGHT 97

Macon is driving through the labyrinth of littered,

cracked, dark streets in the south of the city. He

turns onto Singleton Street and finds a block of row
houses. The bricks of Number 16 have been painted a
rubbery maroon. An orange bugproof bulb glows dimly
above the front stoop.

INT./EXT. MURIEL'S PORCH - DOORWAY - NIGHT 98

Macon gets out of the car and climbs the steps. He
opens the screen door. It CLATTERS in a cheap way and
the hinges SHRIEK. Macon winces. He takes the letter
from his pocket and bends down.

MURIEL 0O.S.
(from inside house)
I've got a double-barreled shotgun
and I'm aiming it exactly where
your head is.

Macon straightens sharply. Her voice sounds level and
dangerous.

MACON
It's Macon.

MURIEL 0O.S.
Macon?

The latch clicks and the inner door opens several inches.
Macon can see a sliver of Muriel in a dark-colored robe.

MURIEL
Macon! What are you doing here?

Macon looks defeated. He gives her the letter. She
takes it and opens it, using both hands. ‘No shotgun.
She reads it and looks up at him. .

went to a hamburger joint and
then...someone came, a holdup
man, and shot him. I can't go to
dinner with people! I can't talk
to their little boys! You have
to stop asking me. I don't mean
to hurt your feelings but I'm
just not up to this, do you hear?

Muriel's head moves, just barely, almost a nod.

INT. LIVING ROOM, MURIEL'S HOUSE - NIGHT 99

Muriel takes one of his wrists very gently and draws him
into the house. She puts her arms around him and hugs
him. His head is next to hers, above her shoulder so
that he is not looking into her face,

MACON
Every day I tell myself it's time
to be getting over this. I know
that people expect it of me. But
if anything, I'm getting worse.
The first year was like a bad dream
-- I was clear to his bedroom door
in the morning before I remembered
he wasn't there to be wakened.
But this second year is real. I've
stopped going to his door. I've
sometimes let a whole day pass by
without thinking about him. I
believe that Sarah thinks I could
have prevented what happened,
somehow -- she's so used to my
arranging her life. Now I'm far
from everyone. I don't have any
friends anymore and everyone looks
trivial and foolish and not
related to me.

Macon seems depleted. It has taken all his energy to
say this.

INT. STAIRWAY/HALL - NIGHT 100
After a moment of silence, Muriel draws Macon across
the living room, up the stairway and across the hall
into a bedroom.
INT. MURIEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 101

The small bedroom has an ) iron bedstead and a varnished
orange bureau.

MACON
No, wait. This is not what I
want.

MURIEL

Just sleep. Lie down and sleep.

We begin a SERIES OF SHOTS which DISSOLVE gently into
each other with a wooziness that matches Macon's
exhaustion: Muriel removes his duffel coat and hangs it
on a hook in a closet curtained with a length of flowered
sheeting. She kneels and unties his shoes. He steps out
of them obediently. She unbuttons his shirt as he stands
with his hands at his sides. She hangs his trousers over
a chair back. He drops onto the bed in his underwear and
she covers him with a thin, withered quilt.

CLOSE ON Macon as he lies in bed and HEARS: Muriel
moving about the small house, shutting off lights,
running water, murmuring something in the bedroom across
the hall. When he hears her come back into the room and
close the door, he is just able to look at her over the
quilt:

Muriel stands in front of the bureau with its old mirror.
She CLINKS her earrings into a dish. Her robe is old,
shattered silk, the color of sherry. She switches off
the lamp. Then she comes over to the bed, lifts the
quilt and slides under it.

MACON
I just want to sleep.

He puts his arm around her and feels the warmth of her
body beneath the cool silk.

MACON
Will you take this off?

MURIEL

I'm bashful.

MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. Macon awakes to the sound of
Alexander briefly COUGHING in the other room. Then it is
quiet again. Macon turns and finds Muriel. She sighs in
her sleep and lifts his hand and places it upon her
stomach. The robe has fallen open; he feels smooth skin,
and then a corrugated ridge of flesh jutting across her
abdomen. The Caesarean. Macon's face is peaceful.

INT. JULIAN'S OFFICE - DAY 103

Macon, again seated in front of Julian's desk, watches
as Julian distractedly puts aside a sheaf of fresh
manuscript.

JULIAN
Good...excellent. Like to show
you something, Macon.

He hands Macon a tiny blue velvet box.

JULIAN
Your sister's Christmas present.

Macon raises the lid. Inside is a diamond ring.

MACON

JULIAN
What is it? It's an engagement
ring, Macon.

JULIAN

She's got to. I am thirty-six
years old, Macon, but I tell you,
I feel like a schoolboy about that
woman. You may laugh at this, but
I love the surprise of her. And
I'm surprised by myself when I'm
with her. I'm not exactly the
person I thought I was!

Macon looks up sharply at Julian. Some vividly responsive

chord has

been struck.

JULIAN
I'm afraid I'm gushing. Want to
know something? I've never even
slept with her.

MACON
Well, I don't care to hear about
that.

JULIAN

I want us to have a real wedding
night. I want to do everything
right. God, Macon, isn't it
amazing how two separate lives
can link up together? I mean
two differentnesses?

This thought, so nakedly expressed, seems to jolt Macon.
He becomes even more disconcerted.

Macon gets out of his car with a pizza box in hand.
Muriel's block has a vigorous street life, lots of
people hanging out, listening to music, talking. Macon,
getting a little familiar with the area now, nods at a
couple of the regulars: DEBBIE and DORRIE, the next-
door neighbor's twin daughters, who are perched on their
front stoop -- flashy sixteen-year-olds in jeans as tight
as sauSage casings.

TWINS
Hey there, Macon.

MACON
How are you, girls.

You going to see Muriel?

MACON
I thought I might.

He climbs Muriel's steps and knocks on the door. Debbie
and Dorrie continue to watch him. He flashes them a

pizza, with a good bit more snap and exuberance than
we've seen in him before.

Right. Now, first you unscrew

it.

ALEXANDER
Me?

Macon nods and offers him the screwdriver.

ALEXANDER
I don't want to.

MURIEL
Let him just watch.

MACON
If he just watches he won't know
how to fix the one in the bathtub,
and I'm going to ask him to manage
that without me.

Alexander takes the screwdriver. He concentrates, his
glasses slipping down on his nose. He is biting his
tongue now and PANTING slightly. He gets a screw
turning.

MACON
Wonderful.

Muriel's silence is strained and anxious. The screw has
loosened enough so that Alexander can twist it by hand.
He even removes the faucet without being told.

MACON
Ah! I believe you may have
natural talents.

Muriel relaxes.

MACON
Look at this. See that gunk?
That's old, rotted packing. So
take it away. Right. Now, here's
the new packing...

116 INT. LIVING ROOM, MACON'S HOUSE - DAY 116

The living room is filled with a cool, steady, DRIPPING
sound. Behind them, through the front door, we see the
aftermath of a snowstorm.

PORTER
Oh, my God.

All over the room it is raining. A pipe has broken up-
stairs. Chunks of plaster have fallen on the furniture,
turning it white and splotchy. The rug, when Macon steps
on it, SQUELCHES beneath his feet.

. PORTER
Oh, this is terrible, just
terrible. Terrible. Terrible.

MACON
(going up the stairs)
Just let me find my boots and we
can leave.

PORTER
Leave?

Porter goes into the living room and begins wringing out
cushions. Macon comes back downstairs with his boots in
hand.

MACON
Never mind those. They'll just
get wet again.

PORTER. -
Will your insurance cover this?

MACON
I suppose so.

PORTER
I must say you're remarkably
calm.

MACON
Nobody lives here anyhow. Come

About what?

PORTER
I'd like to know what you think

person.

MACON
Is that what you call her? "This
Muriel person"?

PORTER
She reminds me of -- I'm not sure
why -- she reminds me of Alicia.

Macon looks sharply at Porter.

MACON
What?

PORTER
When I see Muriel it makes me
think of our mother. I don't
know what it is. The messiness

of it all...
MACON
(angry)
You don't even know Muriel.
(pointing)

You should have turned there,
Porter. Make a right up here.

PORTER
You're not yourself these days,
and this Muriel person's just a
symptom. Everybody says so.

MACON
Who is “everybody," anyway?
PORTER
We're just worried for you, Macon.
MACON
Could we switch to some other
topic.
PORTER

I had to tell you what I thought.

They drive in silence for a few moments.

PORTER
Can you tell me one unique thing
about her? I mean one really
special quality, Macon, not
something sloppy like "She
appreciates me".

MACON
(looking out at
the snow)
She looks out hospital windows
and imagines how the Martians
would see us.

PORTER
What?

MACON
(turning to Porter)
I'm not such a bargain myself, in
case you haven't noticed.
Somebody ought to warn her away
from me, when you get right down
to it.

PORTER
That's not true. That's not true
at all. As a matter of fact, I
imagine her people are
congratulating her on her catch.

MACON
Her catch!

. PORTER
Someone to support her. She'd
be lucky to find anyone. She
lives in that slummy house, she's
got that little boy who appears
to have hookworm or something --

MACON
Porter, just shut the hell up.

PORTER

Macon waves and ducks down an alley.

119 EXT. MURIEL'S HOUSE - DAY 119

No snow now. Macon parks in front of Muriel's house and
takes his overnight bag from his car. DOMINICK SADDLER,
a handsome, muscular, nineteen-year-old greaser, is work-
ing under the hood of Muriel's car. On either side of
him stand the twins, Dorrie and Debbie, talking away a
mile a minute.

TWINS
So she says to us we're grounded.
We march upstairs and slam our
bedroom door, like, just a little
slam to let her know what we think
of her -- and up she comes with a
screwdriver and takes our door off
its hinges!

Macon peers down into the engine.

MACON
Hi, girls. Car acting up again,
Dominick?

TWINS

Hey there, Macon.

Dominick wipes his forehead with the back of his hand.

DOMINICK

Damn thing keeps stalling out.
MACON

How'd Muriel get to work?
DOMINICK

Had to take the bus.

Macon, dressed as he was on his arrival home, is walking
Edward, who now stops at a tree.

They move on, rounding a corner. Macon looks up ahead
with interest.

WHAT HE SEES. Alexander is running along the sidewalk up
ahead in pursuit of a small covey of CHILDREN who, like
him, are on their way home from school. Alexander is
moving as fast as his clumsy backpack will allow.

ALEXANDER
(calling to the others)
Hey, wait for me!

The Children turn and call back at him, in a high, mocking
CHANT --

CHILDREN
Nyah-Nyah-Nyah-NYAH-Nyah-!

Despite this, Alexander picks up his pace, stumbling over
his shoes. At this moment, three more OLDER CHILDREN come
onto the sidewalk between Macon and Alexander. They be-
gin JEERING at Alexander, too. He wheels and looks at
them forlornly. He looks very small.

Macon drops Edward's leash. The dog's ears have perked
at the sound of Alexander's voice.

MACON
(to Edward)
Go!

Edward takes off toward Alexander. The three Older Chil-
dren scatter as he flies through them, BARKING. He draws
up short in front of Alexander. Alexander kneels to hug

his neck. Macon walks up as the other Children disappear.

MACON
Are you all right?

Alexander nods and gets to his feet.

MACON
What was that all about?

ALEXANDER
Nothing.

As they start walking again, we are CLOSE ON Macon's
hand as Alexander slips his own little hand into Macon's.

MACON'S V.O.
(guidebook tone)

Even the most disciplined
professional traveler may
sometimes stumble across that
unexpected item he feels he simply
must take home. That's fine as
long as one is willing to accept
the inconvenience and awkwardness
that comes with each additional
piece of baggage.

INT. WESTERN WEAR STORE - DAY 121

Macon steers Alexander around the boys' department in

the old st

ore, which has wooden floorboards and is jammed

with merchandise. Alexander holds an armload of jeans.

They have

couple for Alexander, who nods as Macon piles them on his

stack.

ALEXANDER
I can do it myself.
MACON

Alexander disappears into one of the changing stalls. In
the space below the door, Macon watches Alexander's feet.

LAURA CANFIELD 0.S.
Macon?

He turns and finds LAURA CANFIELD, a thirtyish mother.

MACON
Yes.

LAURA CANFIELD
Laura Canfield. Scott's mother,
remember?

MACON
Of course.

Macon now sees SCOTT, who had been in Ethan's class at
school -- an unexpectedly tall, gawky boy lurking at
his mother's elbow with an armload of- athletic socks.

MACON
Why, Scott. Nice to see you.
scott
(uncomfortable)

Hi...Yeah, me too.

LAURA CANFIELD
It's nice to see you. Are you
doing your spring shopping?

MACON
Oh, well, ah --

He looks toward the stall. Alexander's new jeans are
puddled around his ankles.

MACON
I'm helping the son of a friend.

know how they are at this age --
She stops herself. She looks horrified.

LAURA CANFIELD

Or rather...

MACON.
Yes, certainly! Amazing, isn't
it?

Alexander steps forth. He wears an oversized T-shirt
and baggy jeans. His hair has grown a bit lately, and
he just looks a lot better than when seen at the doctor's
office.

ALEXANDER
I look great!

INT. .MACON'S CAR - DAY 122

Macon, Muriel and Alexander are on their way to Rose and
Julian's wedding. Muriel seems to be the most anxious.

MURIEL
(to Alexander)
It's Macon's sister Rose that's
getting married. You understand
that?

Alexander nods. He is wearing a new pair of jeans and

some shiny cowboy boots. Macon glances over at Muriel:
she looks pretty. They ride in silence for several long
moments. Finally, Muriel turns to face Alexander in the
back seat.

MURIEL
Now don't be nervous, honey.

He looks at her; it hadn't occurred to him.

INT. /EXT. PORCH/FRONT DOOR, ROSE'S HOUSE - DAY 123

Macon, Muriel and Alexander have just reached the front
door when it is opened by an extravagant lady in her
sixties with tomato red hair -- Macon's mother, ALICIA. -
It takes Macon a second to place her. She wears a white
caftan trimmed with vibrant bands of satin, and when she
reaches up to hug him a whole culvert of metal bangles
clatter and slide down her left arm.

ALICIA

husbands that often.

MURIEL
Pleased to meet you.

INT. ROSE'S HOUSE - DAY 124

Alicia leads them toward the back of the house, linking
her arm through Muriel's.

ALICIA
Muriel, have you known Macon long?

MURIEL
Oh, kind of.

ALICIA
He's very stuffy. All my children
are. They get it from the Leary
side. Their grandparents raised
them, practically, and turned them
all into little Learys.

MURIEL
I think he's nice.

Muriel slips free of Alicia's arm and turns back.

MURIEL
Alexander? Coming?

EXT. BACKYARD, ROSE'S HOUSE - DAY 125

The backyard is full of pastels -- Rose's elderly
Neighbor Ladies in pale dresses, daffodils set everywhere
in buckets. Julian, in black, comes up and puts a gold
ring in Macon's palm.

JULIAN
I guess you'll know what to do
with this.

ALICIA

I can't believe I'm finally getting
a son-in-law. All I've ever had
is daughter-in-laws.

MACON -
(automatically)
Daughters.
ALICIA
No, daughter-in-laws.
MACON
Daughters-in-law, Mother.
ALICIA

And didn't manage to keep them
long, either.

Julian gives the two of them a bemused look and moves
off.

Macon turns and is startled by the sudden nearness of
Sarah. It takes him a while into the conversation to
recover -- she just looks so beautiful to him. In fact,
he doesn't really recover.

SARAH
It turned out to be a beautiful
day.

Are you pleased about the wedding?

. MACON
Well...I am if Rose is, I guess.
Though I can't help feeling...
well, Julian. You know.

SARAH
Yes, I know. But there's more to
him than you think. He might be
a very good choice.

MACON
How have you been?
SARAH
I've been fine.
MACON
Well. Good.
SARAH
I know that you're living with
someone.
MACON
Ah! Yes, actually I...yes. I

Sarah looks past him at Muriel and Alexander across the
lawn talking to Julian.

Rose, in a white dress, comes over and touches their
arms.

ROSE
We're ready now. Sarah's my matron
of honor, did I happen to mention
that?

MACON
No, you didn't.

Sarah looks intently at Macon then follows Rose to a
spot beneath a tulip tree, where Julian and the minister
are waiting. Macon watches Sarah walk, then turns and
sees Muriel and Alexander approaching. Muriel has been
watching him.

Macon smiles at Alexander and begins to move with the
assembled crowd toward the tree, and the CAMERA IS
MOVING too. Everything seems to be moving just A
LITTLE SLOWER THAN NORMAL.

As the crowd STOPS, forming a circle around the wedding
couple, and Muriel and Alexander STOP, Macon and the

beside the minister.

Instead, Macon looks only at Sarah, standing across from
him, next to Rose. And Sarah looks back gravely into
his face.

INT. MURIEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 126
Macon and Muriel are lying in bed.

MURIEL
I never told you this, but a while
before I met you I was dating
somebody else.

MACON
Who was that?

(CONTINUED)

126 CONTINUED: - 126

MURIEL
He was a customer at the Rapid-
Eze Copy Center where I worked.
He brought me his divorce papers
to copy and we started having this
conversation and ended up going
out together. His divorce was
awful. He said he didn't think
he could ever trust a woman again.
He didn't: like going to sleep when
a@ woman was in the same room. But
bit by bit I changed all that. He
relaxed. We started talking about
getting married. Then he met an
airline stewardess and eloped with
her within the week.

MACON
I see.

MURIEL
It was like I had, you know, cured
him, just so he could elope with
another woman.

There is a moment of silence. Macon shifts, putting his
arm around Muriel.

MURIEL
You wouldn't do anything like
that, would you, Macon?

MACON
Who me?

MURIEL
Would you elope with someone else?
Would you see someone else behind
my back?

MACON ~
Of course not.

MURIEL
Would you leave me and go home
to your wife?

MACON
What are you talking about?

MURIEL
Would you?

She cocks her head and considers him. Her eyes are alert
and bright and knowing, like the eyes of some small
animal.

INT. LIVING ROOM, MURIEL'S HOUSE - NIGHT 127

Dominick Saddler is sitting on the couch with Alexander.
The muscular teen dwarfs the little boy, who listens in
fascination.

DOMINICK
Now this here is your paste wax.
(holding up a can)
You never want to polish a car
with anything but paste wax. And
here we have a diaper.

Macon comes downstairs and collects his jacket from a
closet. He and Muriel are going out and Dominick is
babysitting. Macon listens too.

DOMINICK
Diapers make real good rags because
they don't shed hardly no lint. I
generally buy a dozen at a time
from Sears and Roebuck. And chamois
skins -- well, you know chamois
skins.

Muriel comes downstairs in a flurry, collecting her
purse and jacket and keys. She glances at the pair
on the sofa, but what finally captures her attention
is the look on Macon's face as he watches the other
two finish the story --

DOMINICK
So what you do is, you get yourself
these here supplies and a case of
good beer and a girl, and you
head on out to Loch Raven. Then
you park in the sun and you take
off your shirt and you and the girl
start to polishing. Ain't no
sweeter way that I know of to use
up a spring afternoon.

Macon, smiling, turns to find Muriel watching him, with
an intensity that makes him flinch.

I asked him to figure what change
they'd give back when we bought
the milk today, and he didn't
have the faintest idea. He didn't
even know he'd have to subtract.

MURIEL
Well, he's only in second grade.
MACON
I think he ought to switch to a
private school.

MURIEL
Private schools cost money.

Muriel looks at him.

MACON
So? I'll pay.

MURIEL
What are you saying?

MACON
Pardon?

MURIEL

What are you saying, Macon? Are
you saying you're committed?

MACON
That's not really the point...

MURIEL
Alexander's got ten more years
of school ahead of him. Are you
saying you'll be around for all
ten years? I can't just put him
in a school and take him out again
with every passing whim of yours.

Macon is silent.

MURIEL

You don't, do you? You don't know
what you want. One minute you

like me and the next you don't.

One minute you're ashamed to be
seen with me and the next you think
I'm the best thing that ever
happened to you.

He stares at her. He hadn't guessed that she read him
so clearly.

MURIEL
You think you can just drift along
like this, day by day, no plans.
Maybe tomorrow you'll be here,
maybe you won't. Maybe you'll
just go on back to Sarah.

He looks up at her sharply.

MURIEL
Oh yes! I saw you at Rose's
wedding. Don't think I didn't
see how you and Sarah looked at
each other.

MACON
All I'm saying is --

MURIEL

All I'm saying is take care what
you promise my son. Don't go

Macon, Muriel and Alexander are finishing a silent
dinner. Alexander, miserable, can't get away fast
enough; he wolfs down the last of his BLT and hurries
away. Muriel gets up and sullenly begins filling the
sink with soapy water. Macon regards her back for a
while, then moves toward her.

MACON
Shall I dry?

Muriel turns toward him.

MURIEL
Just tell me this, Macon, and be
honest -- why can't we get married
in the fall?

MACON
What?

MURIEL
You'll be separated a year then,
Macon.

MACON

Muriel, please, I'm not ready for
this! I don't think I ever will
be.

She reacts to this last. He sees it and tries to cover.

MACON
I don't think marriage ought to
be as common as it is. I really
believe it ought to be the
exception to the rule. Oh,
perfect couples could marry,
maybe...but who's a perfect
couple?

MURIEL
You and Sarah, I suppose.

MACON

CLATTERS die down. Macon and Alexander look at each
other.

fitful sleep. Half-asleep, she looks at Macon. She

Macon looks at the framed photo of Ethan which is set up
on the table next to him.

MACON
(after long moment)
Oh...yes, fine. Of course.

SARAH
Incidentally, the papers .came
through from the lawyer. For
the divorce.

MACON
Ah.

It was kind of a shock.

When I saw them in black and white

the feelings of the thing. I guess
I wasn't expecting that.

Macon has a sense of some danger approaching, something
he can't quite handle. His tone changes. His voice
sounds unreal even to him --

MACON
Ah! Yes! Certainly! That seems
a natural reaction. So anyway,
good luck with the house, Sarah.
Goodbye.

He drops the phone, like it's hot.

134 INT. HOTEL ROOM, EDMONTON - DAY 134

Macon is standing in an Edmonton hotel room on a weekday
afternoon, phone to his ear.

" SARAH (ON PHONE)
I went over there this morning.
Were you eating popcorn in the

MACON

Macon looks out the window. We begin to INTERCUT: *

Macon swallows. He closes his eyes.

INT. HOTEL ROOM, VANCOUVER - DAY

Macon is on a phone in the bathroom. Half his face is
covered with shaving cream, half has been shaved.

SARAH
Well, I've moved back into the

how lonely it is.

Macon would believe it. He touches a dollop of shaving

INT./EXT. MACON'S CAR, MURIEL'S BLOCK - NIGHT 136

CLOSE ON Macon as he eases his car to a stop at the curb.
He leaves the car running but turns off the lights. He
stares off across the deserted street, in some pain.

WHAT MACON SEES. He is looking at Muriel's house and
the surrounding block. A door opens on the porch beyond
Muriel's and Debbie, one of the twins, quietly sneaks
out of her house and hurries away in the shadows.
Macon's attention returns to Muriel's house. The living
room window is lit.

After another long moment, Macon puts the car in gear,
turns on the lights and pulls away.

has come home from his journey. :

FADE TO BLACK.
FADE IN:
EXT. ROSE'S HOUSE, FRONT YARD - DAY 139

A bright morning. Sarah watches Rose prune a hedge.
Nearby, Macon kneels next to a large sack of fertilizer
copying the name and information into a little note pad.
He listens closely to the conversation.

SARAH
Rose, why haven't you moved back
with Julian? What's keeping you?

ROSE
Oh, Sarah, you wouldn't believe
what a state I found the boys in
when I came back here. They were
living in their pajamas so as not
to have too much laundry. They
were eating gorp for their suppers.

SARAH
I'm not even going to ask what
gorp is.

ROSE

It's a mixture of wheat germ and
nuts and dried --

SARAH
But what about your apartment,
Rose? What about Julian?

Macon stops writing in his pad.

ROSE
Oh, you know, I kept losing that
apartment every time I turned
around, I'd head one block east
to the grocery store and then turn
west to get back again and I'd
always be wrong, always. The
apartment building would have
worked over to the north somehow,
I don't know how.

Sarah looks intently into Rose's face. Rose averts her
eyes and continues to prune.

INT. OLD BAY RESTAURANT - DAY . 140

Macon and Sarah are having lunch at the Old Bay Restau-
rant. The place looks friendlier this time than last.
Their table is near the windows.

SARAH
You know what I missed most when
we were separated? The little
things. The Saturday errands.
Even things that used to bother
me, like the way you'd take forever
in the hardware store.

He folds her hand into a fist and covers it with his own.

SARAH
Macon, I think that after a certain
age people just don't have a choice.
You're who I'm with. It's too
late for me to change. I've used
up too much of my life now.

Macon's glance flicks away and we CUT TO:

Muriel watches as he packs.

MURIEL

Macon? Are you really doing this?
Do you mean to tell me you can
just use a person up and then move
on? You think I'm some kind of
... bottle of something you don't
have any further need for? Is
that how you see me, Macon?

Macon looks at her, but nothing he can say is going to
make it better. His glance flicks away and we CUT BACK

first sentence of a new paragraph in Macon's manuscript.
It reads:

The keys stop suddenly.

Macon sits at his desk. He has forgotten what he was
going to write. He watches a bee working at the blossoms
outside his window. He picks up the telephone and dials.

Muriel is alone here. She's been making chocolate pudding
from a box. She looks bad -- haggard and distraught. We
begin to INTERCUT Muriel and Macon.

Criticize! That's what you wanted
to do! Tell me ‘Oodles of Noodles’
is not a balanced meal and then

go off and desert him and then
have the nerve to call me up and
tell me I'm not a good mother!

MACON

No, wait, Muriel --
MURIEL

Dominick is dead.

MURIEL

Dominick sits on the couch with Alexander, holding aloft
a can of paste wax and telling him his story. But what

Never mind that.

MURIEL

Muriel hangs up. Macon slowly lowers the receiver. As
it CLICKS down, we CUT TO:

Macon and Sarah sit on molded plastic chairs in a
fluorescent-lit hallway. Two plainclothes Police
Officers stand talking down to them. Macon stands to go
with them. .(Edward's BARKING from the PRESENT TIME scene
continues throughout.) Sarah touches Macon's arm before
he moves away --

SARAH
Can you do this?
MACON
Yes.
148 INT. MORGUE - NIGHT 148

Macon follows the Police Officers down a series of halls
and into the morgue. They lead him to a small body bag

Macon opens the front door. Julian is standing outside
with a file folder in hand. Macon opens the door and
lets him in.
JULIAN
Thought I'd bring you the material
for Paris.

Macon nods.

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY . 151

Julian sits down on the couch which is so new it is still
covered in cellophane. He puts the folder aside. Each
shift of his body makes the cellophane CRACKLE.

MACON
(indicates sofabed)
Just arrived this morning.

Julian nods but doesn't seem to have heard.

JULIAN
Do you think Rose is not coming
back?
MACON
(carefully)

She's worried about the boys.
They're eating glop or something.

JULIAN
Those are not boys, Macon. They're
men in their forties. I'm afraid
she's left me.

MACON
Oh, now, you can't be sure of
that.

JULIAN

And not even for any reason! Our
marriage was working out fine.
But she's worn herself a groove
or something in that house of
hers, and she can't help swerving
back into it. .

(he looks at Macon)
At least, I can't think of any
other explanation.

MACON :
Well, it sounds about right. .

They sit silently for a few moments.

MACON
Why don't you give her a job,
Julian?

JULIAN
Job?

MACON :

Why don't you show her that office
of yours. That filing system you
never get sorted, the secretary |
chewing her gum and forgetting
whose appointment is when. Don't
you think Rose could take all that
in hand?

JULIAN
Well, sure, but --

MACON

Call her up and tell her your
business is going to pieces. Ask
if she could just come in and get
things organized, get things under
control. Put it that way. Use
those words. Get things under
control, tell her. Then sit back
and wait.

(pause)
But of course, what do I know?

Julian looks at him intently, his mind racing.

JULIAN
No, you're right.

MACON
Now let's see your folder.

JULIAN
(hands it over,
distracted)
You're absolutely right.

Macon opens it and reads the topmost letter.

The whole damn language has been
slaughtered.
JULIAN

Macon, I just want to say this --

I care about that sister of yours
more than anything else in the
world. It's not just Rose, it's
the whole way she lives, that
house and those turkey dinners and
those evening card games. And I
care about you, too, Macon. You're
my best friend! At least, I hope
so.

MACON
Oh, why, ah --

Julian gets up. and takes Macon's hand, shaking it more

vigorously than Macon is prepared for. He claps Macon
on the shoulder and strides out.

It's fine, Sarah. It looks very
nice.

Sarah strips off the cellophane and stands back, arms
full of CRACKLING light.

SARAH
We ought to see how it opens out.

Macon pulls at the canvas strap that turns the couch into
a bed and opens it.

SARAH
Maybe we should put on the sheets,
now that we've got it open.

Sarah disappears and then returns with a stack of linens
from the front hall. With Macon positioned at the other
side of the couch, she floats a sheet above the mattress
and then bustles up and down, tucking it in. Macon stops
helping and watches her move about.

MACON
Let's give the bed a trial run.

SARAH
(looks up, not
understanding)
Trial run?

But she allows him to take the sheet away and slip her
sweat shirt over her head. Languid, lazy and slow, they
drop to the new mattress.

Sarah watches Macon in her mirror for a few beats.

MACON

them both)
Sarah, don't even start! By God,
if that doesn't sum up everything
that's wrong with being married.
"Macon, the trouble with you is

you know yourself, Macon --"

SARAH
(continuing steadily)
The trouble with you is, you think ~
people should stay in their own
sealed packages. You don't believe
in opening up.

MACON
Okay, let's say that that's true.
Let's say for now that you do know
.what the trouble with me is, that
nothing I might feel could surprise
you. And that the reason I don't
want to hear about this specific
thing is that I can't open up.
If we agree on all that, can we
drop it?

Macon pretends that -he hasn't heard her.

155 INT. AIRPLANE - DAY 155

The plane to Paris is crowded as Macon finds his seat.
Macon glances up the aisle, where more passengers are
arriving. A Japanese Man, a Nun, a Young Girl in braids.
A Woman with a little red vanity kit, her hair a dark
tent.

Muriel.

She walks toward him, watching her feet. When she is
next to him she raises her eyes and it's clear that she's
known all along he was there.

MURIEL
I'm going to France.

MACON
But you can't!

The French Couple next to him look at him curiously.

MURIEL
I'm going to walk along the Seine.

Muriel notices the people stacking up behind her and
moves on.

his way down the aisle, his shaving kit in hand. The

EXT. PARIS STREET - -NEAR HOTEL - DAY 168

Afternoon. Macon walks wearily back to his own hotel.
He sees Muriel up ahead, arms full of parcels. Before
he even thinks, he calls out --

MACON
Muriel!

She turns with a big smile and waits for him to catch up.
He accepts several of her parcels. They head off together
toward the hotel.

MURIEL
Macon, could we eat someplace nice
today?

INT. FANCY RESTAURANT - NIGHT 169

Macon and Muriel sit at a table near the windows that
front a lovely restaurant.

MURIEL
(studying menu)
If I ask them what something is in
English, do you think they'll be
able to tell me?

MACON
Oh, you don't have to bother doing
that. Just order Salade Nicoise.

MURIEL
Order what?

MACON
I thought you said you'd read my
guide. Salade Nicoise. It's the
one safe dish. I've been all
through France eating nothing but,
day in and day out.

MURIEL
That sounds kind of monotonous.

Do you suppose they call them
French windows in France?

MACON
(confused)
What? Oh, I really don't have the
slightest idea.

INT. FANCY RESTAURANT - NIGHT 170

LATER. A pleasant Waiter and Muriel agree on a dinner
for her. The Waiter leaves.

MURIEL
There. Wasn't he nice?

MACON
That was a rare exception.

She bats at the hem of her skirt.

MURIEL
Durn fringe! I keep thinking
something's crawling up my leg.
Where you going tomorrow, Macon?

MACON
Out of Paris altogether. Tomorrow
I start on the other cities.

MURIEL
You're leaving me here alone?

MACON
This is high-speed travel, Muriel.
Not fun. I'm waking up at crack
of dawn.

MURIEL
Take me anyway.

MACON
I can't.

MURIEL
I haven't been sleeping so good.
I get bad dreams. Last night I
dreamed about Dominick. I dreamed
he was mad at me.

MACON

: MURIEL
He wouldn't talk to me. Wouldn't
look at me. ‘Turned out he was mad
because I wouldn't let him use the
car anymore. I said, "Dommie,
you're dead. You can't use the
car."

Mad?

MACON
Well, don't worry about it. It
was just a travel dream.

MURIEL
I'm scared it means he's mad for
real. Off wherever he's at.

MACON
He's not. He wouldn't. be mad.
He's happy as a lark.

: MURIEL
You really think so?

MACON
Sure! He's up there in some kind
of motor heaven, polishing a car
all his own. And it's always
spring and the sun is always
shining and there's always some
blonde in a halter top to help
him with the buffing.

MURIEL
You really think that might be true?

MACON
Yes, I do.

Muriel looks at him lovingly. Really comforted. She
reaches over and puts her hand on his. He seems about
to move it, but then doesn't.

MURIEL
Macon, will you do this for me,
will you just think about it
tonight and decide in the morning?

After a long moment, he agrees.

INT. MACON'S ROOM, PARIS HOTEL - MORNING 1721

It is still dark out as Macon wakes and turns off his
alarm. He lies there waking up, then remembers the bus-
iness of the day. He seems to be mulling the Muriel issue
with some odd good humor.

He decides he will let her go with him. And he cannot
suppress a smile as he sits up and reaches for the phone.
He remembers the phone is out of order, but checks it at
his ear for a moment anyway. He rises and pulls at the
cord and leans over the bureau to peer down at where it
is jacked to the wall. He puts the phone down and moves
the heavy bureau a few inches away from the wall. He
reacts to a twinge in his back, but shakes it off and
stoops down toward the jack.

There is a barely-audible little CRACK. And Macon freezes
in his stooped position. His back has gone out, but he
doesn't want to believe it. And if he doesn't move he
won't be sure. After several moments of delay, he

slowly straightens.

The pain zings into him. He is barely able to make his
way back to the bed and lower himself inch by inch onto
it.

INT. MACON'S ROOM, PARIS HOTEL - MORNING 172

LATER. Macon is asleep in exactly the same position.
There is a KNOCK at the door. Macon opens his eyes.

MURIEL 0O.S.
Macon?...Macon, you in there?

CLOSE ON Macon's eyes, as he makes a decision. A more
rational decision. Informed by the sobering clarity of
his current pain. He says nothing and listens and Muriel
walks away. He closes his eyes again.

MACON

No, wait!-

INT. LOBBY PHONE BOOTH, PARIS HOTEL - DAY 174
The Chambermaid and a Bellhop stand a discreet distance
outside whispering together, having helped a hobbled,

ROSE
Oh, Macon.

ROSE

wondering: ..

ROSE
I'll take care of everything.
Don't you bother with a thing.
Have you seen a doctor?

MACON
Doctors don't help. Just bed rest.

ROSE
Well, rest then, Macon.

176 INT. MACON'S ROOM, PARIS HOTEL - NIGHT/DAY 176

Macon is hunched in an armchair drinking wine which he
pours from a small, mini-bar sized bottle. He is about
to pour the last bit into his glass when there is a
KNOCK.

: MURIEL (0.S.)
Macon?...Macon?

Macon freezes, silent.

MURIEL (0.S.)

He strains to listen, but she is gone.

She smiles and comes over to kiss him. The Bellhop comes
in after her with two pieces of matched luggage. She
goes over to tip. and dismiss him in a breeze of brisk
efficiency.
SARAH

Now, everything's taken care of.

I'm going to make your day trips

for you. We've rescheduled the

other cities and I start on them

tomorrow.

MACON
But how did you get here so soon?

SARAH
Rose is just a wizard. She's
revamped that entire office.
Here's a pill from Dr. Levitt.

She pours some bottled water into a glass.

MACON
You know I don't take pills.

SARAH
This time you do. You're going to
sleep as much as you can, so your
back has a chance to heal.
Swallow.

Macon swallows the pill.

Macon tenses. His back seizes up.

She saw me, too. She seemed very
surprised.

MACON
Sarah, this is not the way it
looks.

SARAH

(evenly)

What is it then, Macon? I'd like
to hear.

MACON

She came over on her own. I didn't
even know till just before the
plane took off, I swear it! She
followed me. I told her I didn't
want her along. I told her it

was no use.

SARAH
You didn't know till just before

MACON

Do you believe me?

Yes, I believe you.

Macon holds her gaze for a moment, but then his eyelids

groceries, Macon is awake, having propped himself against
a pillow.

SARAH
I thought I'd make you supper
myself. Fresh fruit and things.

MACON
That's very nice of you, Sarah.

Sarah begins unwrapping cheeses.

SARAH
I was thinking, after I've finished
the trips, if your back is better,
maybe we could do a little
sightseeing on our own.

MACON
Fine.

SARAH
Have a second honeymoon, sort of.

He watches her set the cheeses on a flattened paper bag.

SARAH
We'll change your plane ticket
for a later date. You're reserved
to leave tomorrow morning. No
chance you could manage that. Did
I tell you about Julian?

Sarah clinks her*glass against his. She begins to cut a
peach into sections and passes him one of the sections.

SARAH

You could have stopped her if
you'd really wanted. You could
have taken steps.

They fall silent. Sarah rises and begins clearing away
their supper. Macon watches her move around the room.
It's hard to tell if the pain in his eyes is coming from
his back or something less physical.

Sarah opens a pill bottle, shakes a white pill into her
palm and brings it to Macon. Her eyes barely meet his

as she hands him the sleeping pill and turns away. Macon
closes his fist around the pill and lets it rest on the
blanket.

Sarah goes into the bathroom. She is upset. When she
catches sight of herself in the mirror, she is startled
and a little embarrassed. She sees Macon's reflection
in the mirror watching her and, almost reflexively,
pushes the bathroom door halfway closed to obliterate
his view.

Macon slowly lowers himself down into the bed, and

suddenly the CAMERA is CLOSE ON him in_exactly the same
i i i at

the start of their affair. And like then, Macon lies in
bed and HEARS: Sarah running water in the bathroom,
moving about the room as she gets undressed and hangs
her clothes, the TINKLING of the chain as she slips it
on the door, the SWITCHING OFF of the lights. The bed
moves and Macon's back stabs pain as Sarah slips in
beside him, but he makes no sound. He listens te Sarah's
breathing as it softens almost immediately.

he lets the white pill fall among the bedclothes.

Macon, hunched and pained, comes into the bathroom. He
slowly-- every move is slow -- begins to shave.

INT. MACON'S ROOM, PARIS HOTEL - MORNING 182

Macon, dressed now, is slowly packing his things into
his bag. He takes the framed photo of Ethan from the
bureau and slips it into the outer pocket of the bag.
Each movement is laborious. The last item is his heavy

book, Miss MacIntosh, My Darling.

He puts it into his bag, newly impressed with its weight.
He thinks about it, then takes it out of the bag and sets
it aside on the bureau. He will leave it.

SARAH
Macon?

He turns to look at her in bed.

MACON
Sarah. I'm glad you're awake.

SARAH
What are you doing?

MACON
I'm packing to leave.

She sits up. Her face is creased down one side.

SARAR
But what about your back? And
I've got all those appointments!
We were going to take a second
honeymoon.

‘ MACON
Sweetheart.

Macon makes his way over to her and lowers himself
cautiously till he is sitting on the bed. He picks up

her hand -- it stays lifeless while she watches his face.

SARAH

You're going back to that woman.
MACON

Yes, I am.
SARAH

Why, Macon?

yourself it knocks you out. Now
it's messed up your thinking.

Macon returns with the shaving kit.

She climbs out of bed and comes over to stand next to
him in her nightgown, hugging her bare arms.

SARAH

You'll be one of those mismatched
couples no one invites to parties.
No one will know what to make of

they meet you, "My God, what does

I thought this might happen.

EXT. PARIS HOTEL - DAY . 183

Macon manages the front door by backing through it,
stiffly.

EXT. PARIS STREET - DAY 184

No taxis in sight. He sets off for the next block. Car-
rying his bag is torture. He tries it in his left hand,
then his right. He steps over to a building with a low
stone curb running around its base. He sets the bag on
the curb, takes out Ethan's picture, leaves the bag, and
hurries on. Up ahead he sees a taxi with a boy just step-
ping out of it. Raising either arm is impossible. He is
forced to run in an absurd, scuttling fashion while
shouting bits of French.

MACON
Attendez! Attendez, monsieur!

The taxi is already moving off and the Boy is just slip-
ping his wallet back into his jeans when he sees Macon
and calls out something and the taxi brakes. Macon makes
his way up to the cab, panting.

Merci beaucoup.

walking along the sidewalk. .

Macon leans forward to peer intently at him, blinking to
clear his view.

MACON MOVING POV of the French Boy as the taxi passes.
His face is not so very different than Ethan's would have
been, these two years later...if Ethan had lived.

Macon sits back, but he does not look sad. In fact,
there is some kind of peace in the memory and the forward
movement of the Boy and the taxi.

The taxi approaches Macon's hotel. A Man is just emerg-
ing with a small anxious dog on his arm.

And there on the curb stands Muriel, surrounded by suit-
cases and string-handled shopping bags and cardboard

cartons overflowing with red velvet. She is frantically
waving down taxis -- first one ahead, then Macon's own.

MACON
Arretez!

EXT. PARIS HOTEL - DAY 186

The taxi lurches to a halt. Muriel looks surprised by
its sudden stop. She smiles for a moment at the Driver
and her eyes sweep over Macon -- not registering him --
as she turns to begin collecting her bags.

Macon watches, suspended in the moment, with a kind of
joy.

Suddenly, Muriel's mind registers what she has glimpsed
in the shadowy back seat. She straightens and turns,
very slowly it seems to Macon. And now a much larger
smile lights her face. Her gaze locks directly onto
his -- and where they meet, there is a blinding, white
burst of light.
