A young man in a tuxedo leans on a railing at the far end of
the pier, looks out at the ocean. He’s unshaven and pale.
He’s been up all night. This is DAVID MURPHY. A CO? stands
at a distance watching David, curious. He crosses.

Someone once said, if you want

There’s no doubt in my mind
about one thing. I was David’s to

The light is over bright, the motion slowed and dream-like.
David, barely seventeen, drives an old klunker of a ear.
Beside him in the front seat is a TEENAGE GIRL. In the back

We fell in love in high school.
David was a-senior and I was a

is each other. David takes her hand, turns it palm up and
kisses it, then slips an engagement ring on her finger.

DIANA (VO)
When I was nineteen David proposed
to me on the merry go round at
the Santa Monica Pier.

INT DAVID‘S DEN VENICE CANALS DAWN

The house is modest and small, but has charm. Book shelves
are lined with books on architecture and odd samples of
4

building materials: granite, linoleum, brick. The furniture
is used or hand made by Davic.

David, in pajama bottoms, has been up all night. He works
at his drawing table on a MODEL OF A HOUSE. I's perfect in
every detail. We note a distinctive row of two-story
arched windows.

. DAVID (VO)
Diana put me through architecture
school selling real estate.

Diana comes in quietly, wearing one of David’s shirts, puts
a cup of het coffee at David’s elbow and kisses his neck.
She slips her arms around him and he smiles. He continues
working. She leans her head on his shoulder and watches.

INT ARCHITECTURAL FIRM DAY

David holds his MODEL with the two story arched windows as
he waits for a job interview. FIVE OTHER YOUNG MEN and ONE
WOMAN are also waiting. They all have models too, and they
all look daggers at each other and David.

and calls for some food.

DAVID (VO)
But for a while all I got out
of it was an occasional
free lunch. Until one day....

A STOCKBROKER seated at a far table rises and approaches
David. Offers his hand and they talk.

DAVID (VO)
I got my big break.

EXT BRENTWOOD SITE DAY

A large, modern two story HOUSE is under construction in a
nice section of Brentwood. We recognize immediately the row
of two-story arched windows. A sign out front announces
that the house is designed by David Murphy. David shows the
stockbroker around, pointing out lovely architectural
details. They both lock pleased.

DAVID (VO)
A rich stockbroker hired me
to design him a showplace. There
were no limits on the budget,
mo restrictions on the design.
Construction was going beautifully....

Two POLICE CARS pull up and several officers come out. One

of them holds a warrant in his hand.

David and Diana go over the monthly bills together.
Suddenly she looks up. She’s crying.

INT DAVID‘S FATHER’S HOUSE DAY
David talks to a little old man on a worn sofa. His father.

DAVID (VO)
And that's how it started.
I borrowed five thousand dollars
from my father to tide us over.
That wasn't easy. Dad’s on a fixed
income and he doesn’t have much
to spare. Then I looked for a job
in construction. But in the
mean time, Diana found what
we thought was the answer. —

When we were married in Vegas,
we gambled. We were careful,
mostly played black jack and
eraps. We went in with a hundred
dellars and came away with a
thousand. If a hundred can be
made into a thousand, five thousand
can be made into fifty thousand.
Or so we figured.

Diana points to the facade of their hotel. The Arabian

Diana stands before the cheapest slot machine, one of a
seemingly endless line. She's feeding in nickles. On either

gambler’s visors. David appears at Diana’s side with chips,
energized.

DIANA
This is stupid. I've already
lost ten dollars.

DAVID
Slots are a sucker’s game. Come on.

They walk through the floor passing a RAISED, ROPED OFF AREA

pit bosses wear tuxes. , .

I remember. It was the high
point of my adolescence. Here’s forty
bucks in chips. Keep your clothes on.

BY THE CRAPS TABLES....David approaches, roaming the floor
looking for his spot. He passes tables that are cold, where
the action's slow or the shooters amateurish. A crowd has
formed up ahead. David checks it out.

A YOUNG MAN in an army uniform is the shooter. He‘’s making
numbers and making points. It‘s a beautiful shoot. The
chips in front of him grow. David immediately feels the
heat, steps forward and bets a single twenty five dollar
chip on PASS.

The shooter makes his number. David’s money doubles. David
lets it ride, starts placing twenty five dollar side bets.

AT A BLACK JACK TABLE

Diana’s stack of chips has dwindled to two. She studies her
cards. The player beside her, a MAN ON THE MAKE looks at
her cards. TWO EIGHTS. The dealer has a ten showing.

MAN ON THE MAKE
You should always split eights
and I love your perfume.

The shopgirl smiles and goes to help another customer.
Diana looks at herself one last time in the mirror, then
sudden sees.....

a MAN in the doorway behind her, watching her. He's in his
early forties, dressed in an expensive but discrete business
suit. On his wrist is a gold Rolex. His eyes meet Diana‘s.
He seems bemused. Perhaps harmless.

Yes.

than ever.

Diana moves through the crowded lobby, headed back to the
casino. She glances over her shoulder to make sure the man
isn't following her. "

It was no big deal. An encounter

Diana wends her way back to David at the craps table. As
she approaches she sees that David is at the center of a
crowd. He’s the shooter and his concentration is enormous.
In front of them are a HUGE PILE OF CHIPS. Diana breaks
into a grin. \

another pass. David laughs.

David takes Diana in his arms and as he holds her she sees
something over his shoulder.

stepping up and entering the HIGH ROLLER AREA. His eyes
connect with Diana‘s.

This is JOHN GAGE. Diana meets the look with defiance,
doesn’t turn away.

hopelessness.

Then suddenly, it happens. Gage looks up, raises his hand
and gestures to David. David stops, unsure of what he saw.
Gage gestures to him again. David looks behind him to see
if maybe the Queen of England’s back there.

Gage is looking right at him. David points to himself,
feeling vaguely ridiculous.

flushes.

more complicated than it appears.

No David.

DAVID
It’ll be fun. Go on.

A hostess opens a gate in the ropes and Diana reluctantly
steps up and inte a different world. The rope latch closes
with a click behind her. Everyone is watching her. Gage
pulls back the chair next to him for Diana. She sits. He
looks at her. She doesn’t look at him.

Gage turns once more to David, smiles, acknowledging the
favor, then without a scintilla of emotion he bets all of
his remaining chips. The dealer deals him two cards. Gage
looks at them and turns them over. Black Jack.

An appreciative murmur from the crowd, which is growing
larger. Diana glances up to David and their eyes meet in
mutual wonder. David smiles, curiously proud of Diana. But
then Gage turns to Diana, ‘taking her attention.

GAGE

appeared and I won my first hand.
You brought me luck.

Everybody is elbowing éveryone'else. DAVID tries to push his
way to the front for a better look.

ON DIANA AND GAGE at the table. The dice are passed to Gage
and he places his bet, the white square, a million dollars.
Then he gives the dice to Diana.

GAGE
Please. Kiss them.

Diana hesitates a moment, startled. There’s no mistaking
the sexual innuendo. Diana lifts the dice and quickly kiss
them for Gage, just as she did for David. She then hands the
dice back to Gage. Gage takes the dice, looks directly into
Diana's eyes as he, too, kisses them.

ON DAVID...-his face clouding. What the hell is going on?

AT THE TABLE....- Right bets fly down all around the table.
Gage rolls. Seven. A cheer goes up. Gage’s million
doubles. The dice come back and Gage holds them out to
Diana. He wants her to kiss them again. She steps back,
shakes her head, firm.

DIANA
No.

GAGE
You think I should quit now?

DIANA
I think I should.

Gage drops the dice without hesitation and a disappointed
moan comes from the crowd. The pit bosses visibly relax.
Gage tosses a white chip across the felt to Diana.

GAGE
I‘d like a chance to express my
gratitude to you and your husband.

He turns to David who stands alone, waiting. Diana moves
immediately to David's’ sideand takes his arm, positioning
herself beside him. Gage smiles easily and extends his hand
to David.

GAGE
John Gage.

DAVID
David-Murphy- :My wife; Diana.
, GAGE
That was very generous of you,
David.

David shakes Gage’s hand, loosening as he feels the warmzh
of Gage‘s charm,

DAVID
No problem.

GAGE
I’d like to return the favor.
Your room will be comped if you
stay another night.

Before David can answer Gage makes the slightest move and
TWO BODY GUARDS appear around him. The crowd parts as he
walks off.

INT CASINO HOTEL ROOM DAY

Diana and David enter, closing the door behind them. David
tosses down their bag and they turn to each other,
astonished. Then they start to laugh. He picks her up in
his arms and swings her around.

DAVID
You won a million dollars!

DIANA
He won a million, David.

DAVID
You won it fer him. And he gave
you a thousand.

He puts Diana down and she gets out the chip.

DIANA
Must be like a nickle to him.
A hundred thousand would have
been fairer. ‘Ten percent.'-

He circles her with his arms, buries his nose in her hair.
They start to kiss. And kiss. A KNOCK AT THE DOOR.

DIANA
Don’t get it.

The knock comes again, insistent. Finally David goes to
answer it. A BELLBOY stands holding THE: RED DRESS.

BELLBOY
David Murphy?
DAVID
Yes.

BELLBOY
Compliments of Mr. Gage.

David digs for a tip. The bellboy refuses it.

BELLBOY
I got it om the other end.

He exits. David looks at the dress. Attached is a card. He
pulls it off.

DAVID
He wants us to come to a private
party tonight at nine o’clock.

Diana takes the dress and holds it up. She looks it, and
then at herself in the mirror.

The main room wraps around two sides of the building. Plate
glass windows look out over huge sparkling night vistas.
Live music. The singer is someone hip and recognizable. A
huge buffet table and open bar. Everyone’s in formal wear.
It’s an astonishing sight.

ON DIANA AND DAVID....as they enter. She's stunningly
beautiful in the red dress. They hold hands and look around
them, feeling like visitors to the Emerald City.

David leads Diana onto the dance floor and they begin to
slow dance. The song is a moving. and evocative old standby,
“The Nearness of You".

CLOSE ON DIANA AND, DAVID, fused together, as if alone in the
crowd. Their movements are sexual and intimate, as if
acting out the lyries of the song. Diana puts her head on
David‘s shoulder. Their body language speaks volumes.

Across the room stands JOHN GAGE......alone, watching as if
hypnotized.

HIS POV...David's strong arms wrap around Diana. His hands
rest possessively in the small of her back. He buries his
nose in her hair and says something. She laughs. And
still they keep moving. Never missing a beat. Then...

CU DIANA.....she looks up and sees Gage. Their eyes meet
and hold for a moment, then Diana turns her face up to David
and KISSES HIM. It’s a long, deep, sexual kiss.

ON GAGE......watching it all, riveted.

DIANA
First time on the market.

GAGE
So you bought it and-

DIANA
Not yet. We're...

DAVID
“putting together a group of

GAGE
Why do you need investors?

DAVID
It’s an ambitious project.
To do it right will be expensive.

GAGE
Talk to the bank. Sell your idea.

DAVID
I don’t think it would fly.
We have no collateral and-

GAGE
Of course you have collateral.
Your collateral is your talent.
Sell them on that. You’re your
own best asset. I sell myself all
the time. Why do you think I’m here?

DAVID
To gamble.

GAGE
No. I'm selling myself. When I

Just so I won or lost big.

DAVID
I don’t understand.
GAGE
This casino is in big trouble.
They clear half a million a
day and still lose money. I could
turn that around. Today I
sent a message to the owners. If

Diana and David exchange a look. Incredible.

That’s naive, Diana. People are

you can buy.

DIANA
In business maybe. Not for leve.

GAGE
What are you saying? You can’t buy

you think?

DIANA
It’s true.

GAGE
Is it?
(to David)

What do you think?

DAVID
I agree with Diana.

GAGE
You do. Okay. Then let's test
the cliche. Suppose, I were to
offer you a million-dollars for
one night with your wife.

David is taken aback a moment. Diana freezes.

DAVID
You're kidding.

GAGE
Let's pretend I'm not. What
would you say?

DIANA
He’d tell you to go to hell.

GAGE
I didn’t hear him.

There's a heartbeat of silence before David answers. Then..

DAVID
I'd tell you to go to hell.

GAGE

That’s a reflex answer because
you view it as a hypothetical.
Say there were real money behind
it. I'm not kidding. A million
dollars. The night would come
and go. The money would last

a lifetime.

DAVID
(uneasy)
What are you talking about?

GAGE
Just making a point. What money
can and can’t buy. Think about
it. A million dollars. A
lifetime of security. For just
one night. Don’t answer right
away. Consider it seriously.

Gage looks ‘directly at Diana and a moment of electric
silence hits the room. David's face hardens.

DAVID
We’re positive, okay?

GAGE

Then you've answered my question
and proved your point. There‘s a
limit to what money can buy.

something powerful, takes its place.

frowns, pushes another button. Waits. Nothing happens.

MD
What is this shit?

DAVID
(very innocent)
Dammit. Something’s wrong.
Should I take the stairs?

JAKE
(distracted)
Yeah. Down the hall to the right.

David surreptiously pulls OFF the Emergency Stop button,
steps out of the elevator, steps aside as Mo and Jake enter
te check out the buttons. David heads down the hall. Mo
and Jake are pushing buttons. They're so absorbed they
don’t notice the doors start to close. David waves bye bye
as the doors shut on Mo and Jake. Alone at last, David
moves quickly back to the Penthouse door and knocks. No
answer. He calls out...

DAVID

DIANA!!!

EXT KINGDOM COME NIGHT

Silent and still in the moonlight. Music drifts from
within.

INT KINGDOM COME BATHROOM NIGHT

A wonder of gold, marble and mirrors. The music is louder,
coming from somewhere on deck. Diana lies in a marble
jacuzzi tub, immersed in bubbles. Suddenly she hears a
tinkling noise, like small belis.. She looks up. There’s an
elaborate crystal chandelier in the bathroom. It sways
softly. The Kingdom Come has started to move.

INT STATEROOM NIGHT

Wood panneled. Oriental carpets. Old looking oils in
elaborate gold frames. Diana enters wearing a plush terry
cloth robe. The pocket says "Kingdom Come". Her clothes
have been taken away and she’s not sure what to do. She
moves to a row of mirrored deors, touches one and it opens.

Inside are a selection of outfits. Various silk dresses, a
velvet embroidered jackets, several choices of shoes.
32

INT MAIN STATEROOM NIGHT

As amazing as you‘d expect. Night views of the Santa
Barbara coast glide by out the windows. Picassos and Fernand
Legers on the walls.

A YOUNG BLACK MAN in a tuxedo plays the music we've been
hearing on a grand piano. Several CRFW MEMBERS in white
uniforms stand in various parts of the room like guards in
an art museum. One is at the bar, another at a buffet.

Diana appears. The outfit she’s chosen is scarlet. We've
never seen her like this. Her hair is piled up. Her bare
shoulders vulnerable. She’s trying to look tough and cool
headed. The crew members watch her with curiosity as she
passes. She avoids their eyes, holds her head high and...
stumbles.

She reddens, looks down. The heels very high, making her

wobble. She reaches down and pulls them off. Barefoot now
and holding the heels, she moves through the room, grabs a
érink and downs it.

INT GAGE'S OFFICE KINGDOM COME NIGHT

Just outside the door, Diana stops and puts the heels back
on. Then tentatively, she moves inside. Gage'’s office is
filled with numerous computers, phone lines, fax machines,
xeroxes etc. It’s a regular command station. Gage sits in
front of a screen showing a computer stock board. In his
fingers he holds a small piece of paper that he’s rolling
and rolling between his fingers, making it into a very thin,
tight, tube. Fer a moment the only sound is the rustle of
the paper in Gage’s fingers. Diana watches. Finally she
clears her throat and Gage turns.

DIANA

(nervous)
They sent for me. They said...
you were....ready.

He says nothing for a moment, just looks at her. Then...

GAGE
Wow.
53

Gage rises, tossing the paper in the waste basket. He walks
around her, stops behind her and reaches out to touch her.
She flinches.

GAGE
You missed a button.

She stands still while he fixes it. Then he takes her arn,
leads her out.

GAGE
Did you know you’re still
bringing me luck?

DIANA
Am I?

GAGE
Today I bought the Arabian
Nights casino.

MAIN DECK KINGDOM COME NIGHT
Diana and Gage move to the rail together.

GAGE
I want to show you something.

Gage turns and signals to someone on an upper deck. In a
moment every single light on the boat goes off. They lean
on the rail and look up at the stars.

GAGE
You only see a sky like this
out on the ocean.

The boat drifts, a black spot on the dark ocean. The stars
above are incredible.

DIANA
You're enjoying this, aren’t you?

GAGE
What?

DIANA
Playing Cinderella.
54

: GAGE
Aren’t you?
DIANA
No.
GAGE

I don’t believe you.
DIANA
I don’t care what you believe.

Gage looks at Diana. She stares out at the dark sky, the
wind moving her hair.

GAGE
Who made the decision?

DIANA
We both did.

GAGE
Do it for your own reasons or don’t
do it. He’s not worth it.

DIANA
You don’t know him.

GAGE
I know he didn’t stop you.

Diana looks over at Gage, a flicker of pain in her eyes.

DIANA
You have no right to judge David.
You’re the one who has to buy women.

GAGE
Do you think I have to buy women?

DIANA
Then why me?

GAGE
I bought you because you said
you couldn't be bought. I
enjoy a challenge.
DIANA
I can’t be bought, Mr. Gage.
We're just going to fuck as
I understand it.

Gage looks at Diana, so tough and incredibly beautiful.

GAGE
I can see I’m going to get my
money‘s worth.

Suddenly he takes her hand and lifts it very gently, so
gently. He kisses it. She doesn’t move. He pulls her
towards him and his fingers run up her arm to her bare
shoulder. He leans forward and gently kisses her shoulder.
Suddenly she pulls back, frightened. It’s sexy. She hadn’t
anticipated this. He whispers.

GAGE
Trust me. Nothing's going
to happen that you don’t choose.

A long moment and he bends her head back, kisses her full on
the mouth.

the PIT BOSS, oblivious to David’s appearance, crosses to
him with a big smile of recognition.

PIT BOSS
Good morning Mr. Murphy. Would
you like to play?

The pit boss leans down and opens the golden ropes. David
stares at him blankly. ,

They roll. She gets up on her knees, kneels over him and
kisses him, they roll again. Suddenly she’s all over him,

They're under the sheets now. She continues to be more
aggressive. Gradually we sense that he is pulling back, and

to kill him. Or both. I broke all his

told him so to his face.

INT JEREMY'S WILSHIRE CORRIDOR HIGH RISE NIGHT

A typical LA upscale bachelor pad. David slumps on the
sofa, devastated. Jeremy sits in pajamas beside him eating
pizza.

JEREMY
I knew this would happen.
You make a deal with the devil.
You pay the price.

DAVID
Thanks Jeremy. Coming from the
man who closed the deal with
the devil, that’s very comforting.

JEREMY
You want her back don’t you?
DAVID
Yes.

David walks along the water. Around him are families with

children, young couples arm in arm, laughing and having fun.
David is lost in his memories, alone and miserable.

I had to start living my life over
again. A life without Diana. But
how could I forget the best thing,
the only thing that had ever
happened to me?

EXT ATM NIGHT

David takes cash from the machine. He locks down at the
receipt. His balance is over a million dollars.

David crumples the receipt and drops’ it to the ground, heads
off into the night.

INT BABE BRANDELLI'S BRIG NIGHT

Pool tables, slumming yuppies and aging Venice bikers. The
place is packed. David sits alone drinking at a table.
He‘s drinking hard. A STRIKING BLOND watches David. DARLENE.
She approaches.

DARLENE

DARLENE
Hundred an hour. Any way you

David looks up. It‘s too perfect. She’s a HOOKER.
INT DARLENE'S APARTMENT NIGHT

David sits on the edge of the bed, undressing. Darlene
moves to him, wraps her arms around him from behind, starts
kissing his neck, his ears.

DARLENE
You like this baby?

DAVID
Den’t talk please.

David closes his eyes. She unbuttons his shirt, kisses his
chest. David keeps his eyes closed, allowing himself to
enjoy the feeling, imagining, pretending she’s Diana.

Then David opens his eyes, sees himself in the mirror with
Darlene. She’s not Diana. Nothing like. She whispers.

DARLENE
You pay up front. |

 

DAVID
Right.

David pulls away and rises. He gets out his checkbook,
starts to write a check.

DARLENE
I take cash, American Express
or Visa.

David continues writing.
84

DARLENE (con‘t)
No exceptions.

DAVID
This time you'll make an
exception.

He hands Darlene the check. She looks at it. It’s made out
for A MILLION DOLLARS. She stares at it a long moment, then
looks at David. Her friendly demeanor evaporates.

DARLENE
Is this some kind of joke?

DAVID
Take the check, Darlene. It’s
good.

DARLENE
Look, I don’t have time to
bullshit.

She TEARS UP the check for a million dollars. David looks at
her a long moment, reaches in his wallet and finds a hundred
dollars, throws it on the bed, walks out. Hold on the
money as we hear:

She opens her hand and looks down to see....the card with
Gage’s number on it.

DIANA (VO)
Why not make him rebuild it?

INT OFFICE SUMMIT BUILDING DAY

Gage shows Diana into a spacious, beautiful office
overlooking the whole city. Diana walks to the window and
looks out.

GAGE
You'll have your own secretary.
Full health benefits of course
and let's say a hundred thousand

Diana turns away from the window and leoks evenly at Gage.

DIANA

enters in his Armani suit, carrying a briefcase.

JEREMY

Honey, I'm home.

No response. Jeremy shakes his head, moves to the kitchen
and opens the fridge. He rummages inside then looks up.

JEREMY
Massive depression and a broken
heart are insufficient reasons
for drinking a man’s last beer.

David still says nothing. Jeremy re-enters and plops down
in a chair. He rattles all the beer cans in front of David,
finds one with something in it and takes a long pull.

It’s late. The building is dark.
INT DIANA’S OFFICE NIGHT

Diana’s still working. The bulletin board is covered with
properties. Real estate market books are open all over the
floor, paperwork everywhere. Diana suifts through a file
marked "SUMMIT HOTEL". She yawns, rubs her eyes. Then she
pulls out something, frowns. She crosses to one of her
books and cross checks something.

EXT SUMMIT CORPORATION DAY

Gage walks from his limo to the building with his assistant
Janine.

JANINE
Mayor Bradley again last night.
Also Wayne Newton. And you
had three calls from Diana Murphy.
She thinks she's found a site
for the flagship hotel.

Janine reacts with disbelief and annoyance.
INT PRIVATE CLUB DINING ROOM DAY

Posh. Old boys network. Groups of MEN at various circular
booths do business. At a large corner table FIFTEEN SUITS
are seated with Gage at the head of the table. At the far
end is Diana. Not only is she the only woman at the table,
she’s the only woman in the room.
90

GAGE
You've been looking for over a year.
We have a Summit hotel chain and no
flagship hotel. What’s the problem?

SUIT ONE
The west side’s overpriced. We've
tried downtown but we can't
find the right property.

SUIT Two
We’ve exhausted the possibilities.
We'd like your permission to
widen our focus.

SUIT THREE
Leng Beach and San Pedro are
two possibilities.

GAGE
(impatient)
San Pedro and Long Beach are the
boondocks. We can't put a flagship
hotel in the boondocks.

The suits exchange looks. An uncomfortable silence falls.
Diana clears her throat.

DIANA
Uh....I....uh...

Everyone looks at her and Diana shifts her papers. A few of
them fall. She has to duck beneath the table to retrieve

them. The suits exchange patronizing glances.

DIANA
I....I believe I've located
two blocks in downtown L.A.
They’re at the intersection
of four major freeways and
adjacent to the convention center.

SUIT ONE
(condescending)
She‘s talking about the Fitzhugh
property.
91

SUIT TWO
That property was considered and
rejected when it first came on
the market a year ago. There are
zoning problems.

DIANA
I spoke to Samuel Blackwell, Mr.
Gage’s attorney who specializes
in zoning. With the new administration
in Sacramento, Blackwell thinks he can
make the problems disappear.

GAGE
Why haven‘t I heard about this?

SUIT THREE

(scrambling)
Fitzhugh’s priced the land way
over market.

SUIT TWO
He's asking six million. It’s
worth three.

DIANA

Fitzhugh’s ready to negotiate.
SUIT ONE

Says who?
DIANA

The L.A. Times?

She “pokes arbdurid“méré“in her papers, pulls out a clipping
and passes it to SUIT ONE.

DIANA
This was in the business section
last week.
(to Gage)

It says Fitzhugh’s in trouble.
He’s preparing to file for bankruptcy.

There’s a stir at the table. All the suits start talking at
ence. Gage just looks at Diana. A slow smile creeps across
his face. Bingo.

INT DAVID’S TOYOTA DAY

David is parked in front of the CONSTRUCTION SITE seen in
the opening. Construction is under way again and the house
is nearly finished. David gets out of the car and crosses
slowly.

EXT CONSTRUCTION SITE DAY

David enters the yard as workers pass to and fro. David is
out of place. An ELECTRIAN passes.

ELECTRICIAN
Hey, you. Look out for the cable.

David steps around the cable and heads towards the house,
ducking through saw horses, cement mixers, past workers who
eye him like an intruder or ignore him. He stops and
watches a WORKER putting on plaster. After a long moment
David is unable to contain himself.

DAVID
You're getting lines in the stucco.

The worker leoks up, annoyed.

DAVID
You should stroke a little
smoother.

A spectacular but spare and tasteful Malibu beach house.
David goes up to the door carrying his portfolio. Rings the
bell. A WINDCHIME sounds. A BUTLER who looks like a Summo
wrestler answers the door.

DAVID
I'm looking for a man named
George Ito.

BUTLER

You have an appointment?

DAVID
No.

The butler moves. to close the door and David puts his foot .
in it. The door slams on his foot and David winces, grits
his teeth. :

The butler looks down at David’s shoe. David, with some
difficulty, remeves it. The butler closes the door.

David rubs his foot, takes off his shoe and rubs it more.
There‘s a large hole in his sock. He hastily puts the shoe
back on, shakes out his foot and waits. And waits. He
strains to see in a window. Nothing. Finally, he turns to
go and the front door opens again. An oriental man in a
"Sting" t-shirt, cotton drawsting pants, shoulder length
hair and Japanese slippers appears. GEORGE ITO.

GEORGE
Hi.

INT ITO BEACH HOUSE EVENING

David and George move onto a spectacular balcony overlooking
the ocean. Rows of gold records line the walls. David puts
his portfolio down on a table. Ito removes his shoes and
indicates that David should do likewise.

GEORGE

David hesitates, remembering the hole in his sock. Ito sits
down on a cushion at a low table with a traditional Japanese
tea service. David waits till George isn’t locking, slips
eff his shoe and sits also. George rolls a joint. David
tucks his foot underneath him.

GEORGE
Yeah the house was a fucking
steal. That poor stock broker,
what a putz. Couldn’t pay his lawyer.
He was willing to take anything.
My wife and I love the place.
How come we never heard of you?

DAVID
I'm a well kept secret.

GEORGE
No kidding.

Ite takes a hit on the joint and offers it to David.

DAVID
Oh....no thanks. Now while I’m.....

Ito smiles too. David glances at the gold records.

DAVID
You’re in the record industry?

GEORGE
Manager.

DAVID
Got any clients that need houses?

Ito’s eyes narrow, somewhat taken aback by David’s chutzpah.
After a moment....

GEORGE

How you feel about schools?
DAVID

Schools?
GEORGE

There’s a school called Tripod.

It’s a for deaf kids. Kind of a

pet project of mine. Only place

like it in Los Angeles. They

lest their lease. I found some land.
Would you be interested?

DAVID
Would I?

David jumps up, grabs his portfolio.

. ,+DAVID (con/,t)
I’ve always wanted to do a
school. As a.matter of fact,
I have some drawings right here-

David pulls out some blueprints and turns to see George
staring straight at the hole in David’s sock. David curls
his toes under.

GEORGE

(gently)
There’s no money in this, man.
It‘s a charity gig.
96

DAVID
I don’t care. I'd like to help.

GEORGE
For nothing?

DAVID
For nothing.

Ito regards David a long moment then smiles.

GEORGE
Let me make a couple of calls.
I knew one of my singers wants to
build a house in the Malibu Colony.

David reacts with surprise, then grins.

By late in the afternoon it
was settled. I was designing

INT SUMMIT BUILDING DIANA‘S FLOOR NIGHT

A janitor is cleaning the carpets. Most of the offices are
dark. It’s the end of a long work day. Gage comes out of
the elevator carrying a bottle of champagne and two glasses.
He wears no tie or jacket and seems happier and more at ease
than we’ve ever seen him. He looks around, unfamiliar with
this part of the building. He turns to the Janitor.

GAGE
Sorry. I’m lest. Can you
believe it? And I own the building.

JANITOR
You own the building?

The janitor glances at the champagne, figuring this guy’s
been drinking.

GAGE
I’m John Gage.

JOE
I'm Michael Jackson.

The janitor returns to his work.

GAGE
You wouldn’t know where Liana
Murphy’s office is, would you?

The janitor points to the last door on the left. It’s open
and a light’s on inside. Gage heads down the hall.

INT DIANA’S OFFICE NIGHT

Diana‘’s at her desk. She rubs her eyes with fatigue,
realizes someone is looking at her. She glances up to see
Gage in the doorway, holding the champagne and two glasses.
She gets to her feet.

DIANA
You got the Fitzhugh property.

By way of an answer Gage pops the champagne, shoots it all
over the office.
98

DIANA
What'd you have to pay?

GAGE

(grins)
Don’t think I’m going to tell
you until we re-negotiate your
percentage.

Diana laughs and he pours her a glass of the champagne.
He holds up his glass. Diana hesitates, touches her glass to
his.

GAGE
Congratulations.

Gage drinks the champange, then moves around Diana’s desk.
He brushes her gently as he passes.

GAGE
Some office you got here.

DIANA
I like it.

He sits down behind her desk, fiddles with her typewriter.

GAGE
Bet you didn’t know I can type.

DIANA
With one finger. I’m impressed.

He types something out. Diana looks over his shoulder and
reads. "John loves Diana" He looks up at her and she
moves away from him.,;-..Her .eyes harden... a

DIANA

You don't love me. You just
want what you haven't got.

her to the door.

Diana nods and the doors close. The Janitor calls out.

JANITOR
How about a raise?

Too late.
INT DAVID AND DIANA’S KITCHEN

The clock reads ten. David enters from the living room and
crosses to the sink, fiddles with the tap. It still drips.
After a moment he exits and comes back with some tools.

EXT SUMMIT CORPORATION NIGHT

The camera moves up, up and up, literally taking off to the
top of the Summit building. Move in on the reof which
looks out at the city of Los Angeles, a sea of lights so
bright it blocks out the stars.

EXT ROOFTOP SUMMIT CORPORATION NIGHT

Gage and Diana come out of the elevator: He leads her to the
edge. Santa Monica Boulevard looks like a runway stretching
beneath them. Skyscrapers dot the skyline. It’s an
overwhelming sight. Gage points to a skyscraper on their
left.
100

GAGE
You see that building over there?
Mine. And the one behind it? Mine
as well. Five of the skyscrapers
you can see from here, I own.
When I buy preperty, I buy
buildings like these. Beautiful
buildings. Important buildings.
Buildings that make me proud. Not
malls or gas stations. Someday I‘11
own the tallest building in the world.
I don’t do anything by halves.

DIANA
You want it all.

GAGE
That’s right.

DIANA
Including me.
(she steps back and looks at him)
Is this how you make love to me?
You’re still trying to buy me.
You're saying, here is my real estate,
fuck me.

GAGE
I’m not trying to buy you.
I could pick up a phone right now
and for five hundred dollars get

DIANA? > posal
What do you want?

GAGE
I want you to look at me the
way you looked at David in Las Vegas.

You want a lot.

She looks out at the view and says nothing more for a

moment.
101

GAGE
Do you know why I’ve never
married?

DIANA
No.

GAGE

Because I won’t settle. I
want a great love, a love that'll
last a lifetime.

DIANA
Love doesn’t last a lifetime
You proved that.

GAGE
No. I just proved you were
with the wrong man.

Diana turns to Gage. Now he’s got her attention. His
voice, the intensity of his charm are hard to resist.

GAGE
I need you. I need to know
you. To be with you. I want to
be around you. I can’t stop
thinking about you. It’s never
been like this for me.

She looks into his eyes. She’s beginning to believe him.

GAGE .

Gage KISSES HER. She allows it for a moment, and then, she
kisses back.

DISSOLVE TO:
INT DIANA AND DAVID’S HOUSE LATER

David sits on the sofa. It’s very quiet. He’s been waiting
along time. He looks at his watch. jJa.m. His face is
haggard and destroyed. All hope gone. He rises, picks up
his coat to go. Then he hears something. A key in the back
door. David steels himself, waits.

He hears the sound of the back door closing. Then footsteps.
David looks out the window. A lime pulls away.

David turns away from the window as Diana steps into the
doorway. She looks beautiful. And happy. She’s smiling,
humming softly to herself. Then she sees David and freezes.
Her smile fades. Her eyes fall on the set table behind
David, the bottle of champagne listing in melted ice. David
steps into the silence.

DAVID

  

What are you doing here?

DAVID
Making a fo. i of myself.

DIANA
You should have called.

DAVID
I guess so.
103

DIANA
I'm sorry.

DAVID
It's my fault. I was stupid
to think I could walk in and find
everything just the way I left it.

She looks at him and we see a flash of the old emotion in
her eyes. They have a moment of connection. He steps
forward, grasping at the opening.

DAVID
Diana....I came here to tell
you that I love you, no matter
what. I was going to say that I’ve
been a fool. That I can’t live
without you.

DIANA
It’s too late.

DAVID
No it’s not.

DIANA

Yes it is. I don’t suppose I‘1l
ever love anyone as much as

I loved you. But it’s over.

Yes. But don’t go too far away.

DAVID
Leave her alone.

I can’t do that, David. I'm

David exits, defeated. As he goes out the door he passes

Janine who’s been outside, listening. She steps into the
doorway and looks at Gage. Gage looks away.

David walks slowly to his Toyota and gets in. He doesn’t
start the car. He just sits.

We begin to hear music. The music is in his mind, in his

Janine is working with several other executives. She
glances up at Diana with hostility.

EXECUTIVE ONE
The Bartlett offer wasn’t legitimate
for the Palm Beach property.

EXECUTIVE TWO
They couldn’t develop the site.
.Diana, why don’t you take a look at
the figures.

Diana nods and makes a note as Janine rises and comes over.
She stops by Diana’s chair and Diana looks up. Janine
pointedly and loudly addresses her.

JANINE
Mr. Gage asked me to find out
about this evening. Where would
you like to have dinner?

Diana is embarrassed, both by Janine's hostility and by
having the date set before the other employees.

Janine doesn’t go. Diana meets her eyes.

DIANA
Is there something on your
mind, Janine?

JANINE
I had nothing against you
as long as you were just
the flavor of the month. But
now you're on payroil,
and that makes me sick. I
got my MBA at Harvard. I’ve
worked for John Gage ten
years. But I don’t get promoted
anymore because I no longer sleep
with him. I'm tired of women
who join the company, fuck him and
five minutes later out-rank mé. “

Diana freezes with shock. Then....

DIANA
I'm not “fucking him."

JANINE

DIANA
Get out of here.

Diana is so stunned she doesn’t respond.

I guess that answers my question.

She walks off.

Diana sits rigidly at a table alone. Her meal is untouched.
Gage enters, crosses the restaurant to her.

GAGE
I'm sorry I’m late. Tom had

He leans down to kiss her and she pulis away. He sits.

Of course I am. Don’t you understand?
I’ve never, in my whole life, been
happier. I want you to be happy too.

He takes something from his pocket and drops it into her
hand. She leeks. It’s a large diamond ring. Diana’s about
to say something but the car phone rings. After a moment
Gage answers it.

GAGE
No I want to sell it. It’s maxed out.
No. Not another week. Handle it
when the exchange opens. Yeah.
First thing in the morning

Diana puts the ring on her finger. As Gage continues to
talk he tears off a piece of paper, start rolling it between
his fingers. Diana watches him a moment, then looks out the
window.

EXT LA COUNTY ZOO NIGHT

Searchlights scan the sky. Limos drop people at the
entrance. The zoo itself has been lit up and decorated for
a formal party. A banner announces a BENNIFIT AUCTION.

CLOSER GAGE’S LIMO..... Reporters swarm around the car as
Diana and Gage gets out. Cameras click and flash. Gage and
Diana link arms and smile. On her hand is the diamond.

Crowds of celebrities and society types sip champagne in
formal outfits between the MONKEYS and FLAMINGOS. Gage and
Diana enter the party. Several business types immediately
come over to Gage, shake his hand. The men fall into
conversation. Diana stands slightly apart, waiting.

let, heads for the gate. He wears a tuxedo, looks terrific.

David tries to enter with other guests. People are handing
invitations to the two bouncers at the gate. David hasn’t
got one. He reaches the bouncers and searches his pockets.

DAVID
Dam. I forget my invitation.
Must have left it in the car.

BOUNCER ONE

Your name?

David pulls out his wallet, gets a HUNDRED DOLLAR BILL,
slips it to the bouncer.

DAVID

I’m sure you’ll find my name there.

Bouncer one looks at David with stony eyes. No way.
EXT PARKING LOT NIGHT

The two bouncers deposit David outside the gate then head
back inside. David debates following them back to the gate,
realized it won’t work. He looks at the wall surrounding
the zoo and heads off into the darkness.

EXT 200 NIGHT

THE PARTY...... guests are now seated at tables in an open
area right in the zoo between the animals. A formal dinner
is being served as JIMMY STEWART (or whatever Hollywood
actor-celebrity will do it) takes his place as auctioneer at
the podium.

Everyone turns to see the giraffes.

JIMMY
Gloria and I bought him last
year. Got a real bargain too.
We’re starting off with a bang
tonight. Our first animal is
an African Bull Elephant.
These handsome fellows are
on the endangered species list.
The minimum opening bid is
ten thousand.

ON GAGE AND DIANA....at a table with other guests. Gage is
talking animatedly to several OLDER MEN in tuxedos while the
elephant is auctioned off. The OLDER WOMEN who accompany
the men are matronly L.A. society types. They regard Diana
with curiosity.

OLDER MAN
I told him he’s already killing
you with these overager.

GAGE
If he tries screwing me on this
jeb there won’t be a second chance.
I won't work with him again. And
I‘1l make damn sure nobody else does.

OLDER MAN
He'll play ball. He’s got to.

GAGE
The dollar always talks in the end.
Always.

Diana listens but she says nothing. Jimmy Stewart finishes
“gelling” the Elephant and holds up a KOALA BEAR.

JIMMY
Now, have we got any takers for
this little guy? He’s cute, he’s soft,
he’s nocturnal, owns an airline!

The bidding starts on the Koala and is fairly heated.

EXT ZOO WALLS NIGHT

David circles around the perimeter of the zoo, looking for
another way in. There’s none in sight. The sounds of the
party are getting fainter. David’s desperate. The wall’s at
least thirty feet high but there’s an occasional brick
protruding. He starts to scale the wall.

EXT ANIMAL ENCLOSURE NIGHT

4% darkened corner of the zoo. The lights and sounds of the
party can be seen in the distance. David drops over the
wall, looks to see where he is.

It’s a rocky terrain with occasional stands of bamboo.

ON DAVID....he makes his way down the slope of the enclosure
and scales another wall, drops. He takes a deep breath,
gets his bearings.

HIS POvV..... a long slope of grass leading to a low fence.
Between him and the fence are about two hundred SLEEPING
FLAMINGOS.

David heads dewn the grass quietly but when he’s about
halfway, one of the birds wakes up, squawks, and all the
flamingos start flying in all directions. David runs,
jumps the low wall around the flamingo enclosure and runs
down the zoo paths towards the lights of the party.

She nods.

David can be seen inching his way forward. His eyes search
the sea of faces. Finally he sees.....

DIANA AND GAGE...Diana leans over and whispers something in
Gage’s ear. He smiles in agreement. He says something and
she laughs. They look like an established couple. Gage
takes her hand in his, looks at the ring. Diana looks
happy. Settled.

ON DAVID....He has his answer. It’s too late.

ON JIMMY STEWART.....

And now we come to my personal
favorite. The hippo. He’s a
little big to bring up here on
the podiun. Weighs about as much
as your average school bus.
Not cheap to buy or to keep. But a real
favorite with the kids who come
to the zoo. We'll take an
opening bid at thirty thousand.

THE AUDIENCE.....murmurs in surprise. It's a stiff price
tag. Silence for a moment.

JIMMY
Who would like to open the
bidding? I’m sure somebody
here wants a hippo.

Diana leans over and confers with Gage. He raises his hand
to bid.

GAGE

This generous bid is rewarded with applause.

All eyes are on David. He speaks again, his voice clear and
even.

DAVID

The audience gasps.

JIMMY
A million dollars?

David nods his confirmation.

JIMMY
Anyone want to top-that bid?

The audience breaks into stunned laughter. The auctioneer
looks at Gage. Gage shakes his head no. He's annoyed but
not crazy.

Everyone applauds. Several people come over to shake David’s
hand. David crosses to Diana and Gage’s table. She looks
up at him, unsure what to say. There are tears in her eyes.

DAVID
Hello Diana.

I wanted you to have the money.

DAVID
I wanted you to have the hippo.

He turns to Gage.

DAVID (con't)

were in high school.

Gage looks uncomfortable. David pulls some papers from his
pocket.

DAVID

understand this is what you want.

And all I want is for you to
be happy. I hope, with all my
heart, that this will make you
