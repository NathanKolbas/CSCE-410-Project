ADAPTED SCREENPLAY
DAVID HARE

BASED UPON THE NOVEL BY
MICHAEL CUNNINGHAM

 
FADE IN:
EXT. MONK'S HOUSE (RODMELL, ENGLAND) - DAY

A river flows, not far from a small house in the Sussex
countryside.

SUPERIMPOSE: SUSSEX, ENGLAND. 1941.

It is the 28th of March, a desolate, gray morning, as a
woman of 59, very thin, in a huge overcoat with a fur
collar, comes out of the house and hurries across the
lawn. The edge of the lawn turns into a grassy, open
field as she carries on her way, moving quickly,
determinedly towards her destination.

EXT. RIVER OUSE - DAY

The woman reaches an embankment and has to clamber down
to a brackish, mud-brown River Ouse. Her elegant,
unsuitable shoes stick in the mud. The woman is seen
more closely -- her face pale, fine, gaunt. As soon as
she gets to the river's edge she looks round for a
suitable stone. She sees one lying on the ground, the
size and shape of a pig's skull. She picks it up and
crams it a little clumsily into the pocket of her coat.
Then VIRGINIA WOOLF turns and without taking off her
shoes begins to wade out into the river.

EXT./INT. MONK'S HOUSE - DAY

LEONARD WOOLF is coming in from the garden on the other
side of the house. At this point, he is 61. He has
muddy corduroys and a pullover, the very picture of the
aging intellectual -- austere, ascetic with a fine
forehead and glasses. He comes distractedly into a small
hallway at the back of the house and starts taking off
his Wellington boots, unaware of anything wrong.

INT. MONK'S HOUSE - SITTING ROOM - DAY

Two blue envelopes are propped up on the mantelpiece. In
handwriting, the single word "Leonard" is on one; the
single word "Vanessa" is on the other. LEONARD'S hand
reaches to lift his envelope, leaving the other where it
is. He stands, fearful. The sitting room of the house
is bohemian, casual, artistic, attractive. A YOUNG MAID
comes into the room, unaware of the drama that is about
to unfold.

MAID
Are you ready for lunch, sir?

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

LEONARD
Not quite. Not just at the
moment.

The MAID goes out. LEONARD, still in his gardening
clothes, is tense as he opens the envelope. He unfolds
two blue pages. VIRGINIA WOOLF'S voice is hard as she
reads the letter.

VIRGINIA (V.O.)
Dearest, I feel certain that I am
going mad again. I feel we can't
go through another of these
terrible times. And I shan't
recover this time. I begin to
hear voices and can't concentrate.
So I am doing what seems the best
thing to do.

LEONARD looks up, alarmed, beginning to panic.

VIRGINIA (V.O.)
You have given me the greatest
possible happiness. You have been
in every way all that anyone could
be. I know that I am spoiling
your life, that without me you
could work. And you will, I know.

EXT. MONK'S HOUSE (RODMELL) - DAY

LEONARD runs back down to pull on his Wellington boots,
then runs out of the back room. He comes out of the
house and moves rapidly down the lawn. Terrified, he
begins to run as the river comes in sight. Meanwhile:

VIRGINIA (V.O.)
You see, I can't write this
properly. I want to say is that I
owe all the happiness of my life
to you. You have been entirely
patient with me and incredibly
good. Everything has gone from me
but the certainty of your
goodness. I can't go on spoiling
your life any longer. I don't
think two people could have been
happier than we have been.

LEONARD has reached the edge of the river. He sees a
woman's footprints in the mud. He looks out across its
empty, flowing surface.

VIRGINIA (V.0O.)
Virginia.
EXT. RIVER - DAY

At once the image of VIRGINIA WOOLF'S body, face down,
swirling fantastically like a Catherine wheel, back on
the surface of the water and carried along by the
current. Her hair is unloosed, her coat has billowed
out. Her body swirls, moving fast downstream, wildly
festooned like Ophelia, then comes to rest against an
underwater pillar and curls up like a baby as the water
catches the corpse against the stone. It is caught
against the stanchion of a bridge. Over the bridge, in
convoy, a line of Army trucks is passing, loaded with
soldiers in transit. The convoy passes over, ignorant of
the corpse beneath the bridge.

EXT./INT. THE BROWNS' HOUSE (LOS ANGELES) - DAWN

CREDIT SEQUENCE. Now a delivery truck moves down a
suburban street.

SUPERIMPOSE: LOS ANGELES. 1951.

The CREDITS BEGIN. It is only just past dawn as the
truck passes a car coming from the opposite direction.
The car approaches a one-level, small detached house,
which sits, secure, confident, a family image of post-war
America. The car draws up in the drive, and from it gets
out DAN BROWN, a sturdy, handsome American, just turning
30. He wears suit trousers and a white open-neck shirt,
and he is carrying a bunch of white roses. He lets
himself in through the front door, and moves, roses in
hand, along past the sitting room with its pastel shades
and low, sparse furniture into the kitchen. As he
reaches for a vase, he looks towards the door of a
nearly-darkened bedroom which is open at the back of the
house. A few rays of light from the window help to pick
out shapes. In the bedroom LAURA BROWN, a few years
older than DAN, is lying asleep in the bed. She is
small, angular and fragile. She turns a moment in her
sleep.

EXT. HOGARTH HOUSE (RICHMOND) - DAWN (1923)
SUPERIMPOSE: RICHMOND, ENGLAND. 1923.

A younger LEONARD WOOLF, only 43, is walking past the
church, carrying a newspaper and a pile of envelopes and
packages he has collected. This suburban quarter, a half
an hour away from London, is rich with flowers, lawns,
trees. In the other direction come the morning
COMMUTERS, dark-coated men, on their way to the station
to work. Beside the church is a big gray-stoned house,
its great face unmoving in the dawn.
10

INT. HOGARTH HOUSE - HALL AND GALLERY - DAWN 9

LEONARD WOOLF opens the door of the house and goes into
the hall, which is lined with paintings. He puts down
the packages and paper and looks up in time to see a man
in his 60s, obviously a DOCTOR -- he carries a doctor's
bag and is in a dark coat -- coming down the stairs,
heading to have a word with him.

LEONARD
Ah, Doctor. Good morning.

DOCTOR
Mr. Woolf. No worse, I think.
The main thing is to keep her
where she is, keep her calm.

LEONARD
Mmm. Friday then?

DOCTOR
Friday.

Their conversation is left behind. Upstairs, on the
first floor, beyond the banisters of an open gallery, is
the room the DOCTOR has come out of. Inside the bedroom,
a woman is alone. She is lying chastely, blinds down at
the windows. She is the younger VIRGINIA WOOLF, now only
41. She is staring up at the ceiling.

EXT./INT. CLARISSA'S APARTMENT (NEW YORK) - DAWN (2001) 10
SUPERIMPOSE: NEW YORK CITY, 2001.

A SUBWAY TRAIN RATTLES violently PAST and a lone WOMAN is
left standing on the platform. At street level, the sun
is just about to rise down West 10th, one of the leafiest
and most pleasant streets in the Village. The woman,
SALLY LESTER, is walking quickly down the dawn street,
returning home. She is tall, dark, dynamic, in her late
30s, wearing a leather jacket and jeans. She approaches
a high red-brick terraced house, goes up the steps and
lets herself in through its white-painted front door.
SALLY goes up to the first-floor apartment, which she
also unlocks. SALLY walks straight through the living
room of quiet, Bloomsbury-bourgeois homeliness --
terracotta and pine, clay post, ceramics, plants and
massive numbers of books. She goes down a corridor into
a warm-colored bedroom, light beginning to beat now
against large blinds. SALLY sheds clothes as she goes,
taking off her leather jacket and jeans, stripping down
to a T-shirt and knickers. She gets into the bed, does
nothing to wake the apparently sleeping figure beside
her. CLARISSA VAUGHAN is short of 50, tall, splendid
beside the smaller SALLY. CLARISSA does not react
visibly, but a moment after SALLY closes her eyes,
CLARISSA opens hers.
11

INT. MONTAGE - ALL OF THE ABOVE - ALL DAWN 11

2001, 1951 and 1923. In MONTAGE, DAN BROWN stands in the
bedroom in front of the mirror, tying his tie. CLARISSA
throws back the sheet from the bed and gets up. She
comes into the small bathroom in her white night gown,
ties her hair back behind her head. LAURA, awake now,
reaches for a book which is lying at the side of her bed.
As her hand reaches for it, the title is clearly seen:
Mrs. Dalloway. VIRGINIA sits alone in her bedroom in her
dressing-gown, looking at herself in the mirror, then
lifts her fingers to adjust her hair. Water pours onto
CLARISSA'S face in the shower as she reaches her naked
arm out in front of her to grope for the tap, invisible
in steam. DAN sets out the breakfast things at the
kitchen table for three people,’ then goes and spoons
Nescafe for himself into a mug. He pours on hot water.
CLARISSA, in a robe, goes to fill her percolator from a
kitchen sink which is full of live crabs, in water.
VIRGINIA completes dressing, checks herself neatly in the
mirror, walks down the corridor and stands for a moment
at the top of the stairs, readying herself. CLARISSA
comes into her living room, stands in the middle with her
remote control and adjusts the lighting, then turns ON a
CLASSICAL RADIO STATION. LAURA arranges the pillows to
enjoy a luxurious few moments of reading. She turns to
listen for the sound of her husband in the kitchen.

In succession, the three women, suspended: VIRGINIA,
pausing, CLARISSA looking around satisfied with the
environment she has created, LAURA listening. Then one
thing disturbs CLARISSA: a bunch of sorry-looking dead
flowers in the corner of the room. She shakes her head
in irritation. DAN brings his roses from the sink and
puts the vase on the kitchen table. As he does so,
another vase is put down by a MAID'S hands, this time
with a bunch of blue cornflowers. As it goes down,
echoing the identical motion from 28 years later, the
CREDITS END.

INT. HOGARTH HOUSE - HALL AND GALLERY - DAY (1923) 12

The vase of cornflowers is seen to be on a table in the
open hall of Hogarth House. LEONARD WOOLF is sitting
eating toast, drinking coffee, and already proof-reading
a manuscript. He looks up at the sound of VIRGINIA
appearing from upstairs.

VIRGINIA
Good morning, Leonard.

LEONARD

Good morning, Virginia. How was
your sleep?

(CONTINUED)
12 CONTINUED: 12

VIRGINIA
Uneventful.

LEONARD
The headaches?

VIRGINIA
No. No headaches.

LEONARD
The doctor seemed pleased.

VIRGINIA helps herself to tea from the table and nods at
the mail.

VIRGINIA
That's all from this morning?

LEONARD
Yes. This young man has submitted
his manuscript. I've found three
errors of fact and two spelling
mistakes and I'm not yet on page
four.

LEONARD is watching her all the time and sees that she is
not planning to sit down.

LEONARD
Have you had breakfast?

VIRGINIA
Yes.

LEONARD
Liar.

LEONARD'S tone is casual. He has the quiet, tactful
manner of a good nurse.

LEONARD
Virginia, it is not my insistence.
It's the wish of your doctors.
VIRGINIA just looks at him, not answering.
LEONARD
I'm going to send Nelly up with a
bun and some fruit.
Again, VIRGINIA looks at LEONARD, disobediently.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (2) 12

LEONARD
Very well, then. Lunch. A proper
lunch. Husband and wife sitting
down to soup, pudding and all. By
force, if necessary.

VIRGINIA
Leonard, I believe I may have a
first sentence.

LEONARD looks her in the eye, knowing how stubborn she
is.

LEONARD
Work, then. But then you must
eat.
INT. HOGARTH HOUSE - STUDY - DAY 13

VIRGINIA goes into her plain, serene study and sits down,
picking up a board on which she writes. There is an
inkwell, a fountain pen. She lights a cigarette. Then,
charged with quiet excitement, she opens a clean
notebook. The blank page. Then a feeling of pleasure
appears on her face in the hushed room. Before writing
she tries her sentence out loud.

VIRGINIA
Mrs. Dalloway said she would buy
the flowers herself.

INT. BROWNS' HOUSE - LOS ANGELES (1951) 14

LAURA is lying in the bed, luxuriating in a moment of
being alone. She reaches for the copy of Mrs. Dalloway
beside her bed and she opens it. She smiles in
anticipated pleasure. She speaks out loud.

LAURA
'Mrs. Dalloway said she would buy
the flowers herself.'

INT. CLARISSA'S APARTMENT - NEW YORK (2001) 15

CLARISSA is standing in the middle of the living room,
frowning, as if wondering what she should do. Then she
calls out to SALLY, unseen in the other room.

CLARISSA
Sally! I think I'll buy the
flowers myself.
16

17

INT. CLARISSA'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAY 16

SALLY, still lying in bed, blearily reacts to what she
has heard.

SALLY
What? What flowers?

And then she remembers what day it is. SALLY starts to
get out of bed.

SALLY
Oh shit, I'd forgotten...

SALLY falls back on the bed.

INT. BROWNS' HOUSE - DAY (1951) 17

A 5-year-old boy is watching as cereal is poured into a
bowl. LAURA and DAN'S son, RICHIE, is sitting at the
table as DAN prepares his breakfast. RICHIE is in
pajamas, a sensitive little boy, his face unable to
censor his shifting feelings. DAN is in shirt and tie,
his jacket neatly hung on the back of a chair.

DAN
There you are, son. You're never
going to be a big boy if you don't
eat your breakfast. You're going
to be’the big brother. It's a
very important job.

RICHIE
Is Mommy getting up this morning?

DAN
Of course she is. Of course
Mommy's getting up. She just
needs her rest. Look. Here she
is.

And indeed, LAURA has now appeared in the doorway, the
bulge of an early to mid-term pregnancy visible. LAURA
shakes her head at the sight of the white roses on the
table. There's something odd, distant in her manner.

LAURA
Happy birthday.

DAN
Morning, honey.

LAURA
Oh, Dan. Roses. On your own
birthday. You're too much,
really.
(CONTINUED)
17 CONTINUED: 17

~ DAN

He'll eat it now that you're here.

DAN gestures at RICHIE.

LAURA
It's your birthday. You shouldn't
be out buying me flowers.

DAN

Well, you were still sleeping.
LAURA

So?
DAN

Well, we decided it would be
better if we let you sleep ina
little. Didn't we?

DAN smiles conspiratorially at his son. LAURA reaches
down and kisses RICHIE.

LAURA
Good morning, bug.
Co DAN
You need to rest, Laura. You're
only four months away.

LAURA
Honestly! I'm fine. I'm just
tired.

DAN touches her stomach tenderly. LAURA smiles, but then
slips away. She pours herself coffee. DAN is putting
his jacket on over his dazzling white shirt, readying
himself for work.

DAN
I've been telling him he's got to
eat his breakfast.

LAURA
That's true.

DAN
So it's a beautiful day. What are
you two going to be doing with it?

LAURA
co Oh, we've got our plans, haven't
: we?

(CONTINUED)
17

CONTINUED: (2) 17

DAN
What plans?

: LAURA
Well, it wouldn't be much of a
party, would it, if I told you
every detail in advance?

DAN
Then I'd better stop asking
questions then, huh?

DAN grins at RICHIE, the whole performance for his
benefit.

DAN
Hey, is that the time? I'd better
get going.

DAN is looking at his watch. It's a morning ritual --
the same every day. He gathers his briefcase and heads
for the door in haste.

LAURA
Have a good day.

DAN
You too.

LAURA
And, Dan...

DAN stops at the door.
LAURA

Happy birthday.

DAN
Thank you.

DAN'S gone. Without him, the room feels silent. RICHIE
looks at his mother. It's as if she's nervous at being
left alone with RICHIE. LAURA waves good-bye to DAN
outside in the drive, then turns back to RICHIE.

LAURA
You need to finish your breakfast.

RICHIE
That's what I'm doing.

LAURA comes and sits at the table. RICHIE watches her,
expectant.

RICHIE
Mommie, can I help?

LAURA
Well...

RICHIE

Can I help make the cake?

LAURA frowns a second, as if regretting her son's
eagerness.

LAURA
Of course you can, sweet pea. I'm
not going to do anything without
you.

INT. CLARISSA'S APARTMENT - DAY 18

SALLY appears from the bedroom and looks down to the
living room where she sees CLARISSA can be heard on the
phone. SALLY is pulling on her jeans. The whole
apartment is submerged in books -- bound proofs,
hardbacks and manuscripts.

CLARISSA
No, of course you must come. I
mean it. I always wanted you to
come. And everyone involved in
the actual ceremony.

CLARISSA acknowledges SALLY with a wave of the hand.
SALLY turns and goes into the kitchen while CLARISSA goes
back to the phone.

CLARISSA
I don't know. Around sixty. Well
it will, it will mean so much.
The whole occasion. And so the
least I can do is have you all to
dinner. Just to say thank you. I
mean it. Of course.

SALLY is gone into the kitchen to pour hot coffee. She
looks into the sink at the wriggling crabs.

SALLY
My God, what if nobody comes? I
suppose we can live for a month
off crustaceans.

SALLY comes back into the room with her coffee and
watches CLARISSA, who is still working her charm on the
phone. SALLY mimics her, wordlessly.

CLARISSA
Oh, I take that as a yes. Oh,
that's great. I'm thrilled. 0h,
good.

SALLY smiles affectionately at how characteristic of
CLARISSA this whole conversation has been.

EXT. WEST 10TH STREET (NEW YORK) _- DAY (2001) 19

The sun is shining as CLARISSA appears at the top of the
little run of steps from her apartment and heads
cheerfully out onto 10th Street. It's a dazzling day.

EXT. WASHINGTON SQUARE - DAY 20

CLARISSA heads down Fifth Avenue in good spirits.
Rappers go by, skate-boarders. A few PASSERS-BY greet
her as she moves through the district, a familiar figure,
at ease in her favorite quarter. She is on a mobile
phone, still making her arrangements for the party.

CLARISSA
This is Clarissa Vaughan. Yes,
I'm just confirming that you're
sending the car to pick me up
first. Yeah, and then we're
going...

NEIGHBOR
Hi, Clarissa!

CLARISSA
Hi, hi, can't talk.

CLARISSA waves and returns to her mobile.

CLARISSA
And then we're going over to six
seventy-five Hudson. That's
right. Between Fourteenth and
Ninth. Then uptown. And there I
will need you to wait. And it'll
be over at seven.
21

22

13.

EXT. SPRING STREET - DAY 21

Now CLARISSA is pausing for traffic and walking across
Spring Street towards an exquisite flower shop, which is
decked in buckets of summer blooms. CLARISSA heads
cheerfully towards the glass door and goes in.

INT. FLOWER SHOP - DAY 22

CLARISSA goes into the chic little flower shop and raises
her arms a little to greet the owner. Her name is
BARBARA -- in her fifties, pale, with dark hair.

CLARISSA
Flowers! What a beautiful
morning!

BARBARA kisses CLARISSA and puts an arm round her, the
two of them at ease.

BARBARA
Clarissa, hi! How are you?

CLARISSA
I'm having a party! My friend
Richard's won the Carrouthers.

BARBARA
Well, that's just terrific. If I
knew what it was.

CLARISSA
It's a poetry prize. For a life's
work. It's the most prestigious.
For a poet it's the best you can
do.

BARBARA
Oh. Very good.

CLARISSA is proud on Richard's behalf but BARBARA is
already pointing along the rows of flowers.

BARBARA
So what would you like? We've got
loads of lilies...

CLARISSA
No. Too morbid. Hydrangeas, I
think. And let's just have
buckets of roses. Whatever. To
hell with it. Spare no expense.

CLARISSA picks out one bunch of flowers.
(CONTINUED)
14.

22 CONTINUED: 22

CLARISSA
I'm going to take these with me.

BARBARA gets out armfuls of yellow roses and takes them
to the desk, while an ASSISTANT takes the ones CLARISSA
has picked out to take back herself. CLARISSA wanders up
the other end. Now BARBARA is cutting the stalks and
wrapping them.

BARBARA
I actually tried to read Richard's
novel.

CLARISSA
Oh, did you? I know it's not
easy.

BARBARA smiles, not unkindly, at the understatement.

CLARISSA
I know. It did take him ten years
to write.

BARBARA

Yeah, well, I figured. Maybe it
just takes another ten to read.

CLARISSA just smiles, coming to the counter to collect
her flowers.

BARBARA
It's you, isn't it?
CLARISSA
What is?
BARBARA
In the novel? Isn't it meant to
be you?
CLARISSA

Oh, I see. Yeah.
CLARISSA shrugs, half-pleased, half-embarrassed.

CLARISSA
I mean, in a way. Sort of.
Richard's a writer. That's what
he is. He uses things which
actually happen.

BARBARA
Yes.

CLARISSA
And years ago, he and I were
students, it's true. But then he

BARBARA
Sure.

CLARISSA
I don't mean in a bad way.

BARBARA looks at her a moment. CLARISSA frowns.
CLARISSA
More like, he makes them his own.
INT. HOGARTH HOUSE - STUDY - DAY 23

VIRGINIA WOOLF sits in her study, pen poised. She speaks
to herself.

VIRGINIA
A woman's whole life...

EXT. SPRING STREET - DAY 24

CLARISSA comes out of the flower shop, carrying a bunch
of flowers and sets off down the street. VIRGINIA
continues speaking underneath.

VIRGINIA (V.O.)
... in a single day.

INT. BROWNS' HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY (1951) 25

LAURA sits thinking at the kitchen table, turning the
pages of a cookery book.

VIRGINIA (V.0.)
Just one day... and in that day,
her whole life.

RICHIE has run across the kitchen and now climbs his
mother's lap.

Now CLARISSA is walking through the meat market, carrying

her distinctive bunch of flowers.

She crosses the road among the meat trucks. And then she
approaches the huge, red-painted triangular building
which looms up at her from the crossroads.

INT. RICHARD'S APARTMENT - DAY 27

At an upstairs window a MAN in a dressing gown parts his
curtain to look down at CLARISSA approaching.

INT./EXT. TRIANGLE BUILDING - DAY 28

CLARISSA, confident, cheerful, approaches a doorway
crammed between the metal criss-crossings of fire
escapes. She opens the door with a key and goes into a
tiny, squalid, airless lobby. A fluorescent panel
splutters on the ceiling. CLARISSA heads for the
cheerless graffiti-strewn freight elevator, closes the
gate and rides upward.

INT. RICHARD'S APARTMENT AND CORRIDOR - DAY 29

CLARISSA rings the bell of RICHARD'S apartment, then
presses her face close to the door to listen.

RICHARD (0.S.)
(inside)
Mrs. Dalloway, it's you.

CLARISSA
Yes, it's me.

RICHARD (0.S.)
(inside)
Come in.

CLARISSA turns the lock with her own key and goes in to a
desolate loft space. The first space is in near
darkness, a gloomy kitchen-bathroom area. CLARISSA picks
her way carefully through to the second, larger space --
the living area -- where the man at the window is
sitting, pale, stick-limbed, in a rotting armchair which
is covered in towels. RICHARD is in his late 40s, gaunt
from AIDS, a noble skull merely, his boxer's nose and
high forehead lit by a streak of light from between the
blinds. He is wearing a blue robe with child-like
drawings of rockets and astronauts on it. The whole
place is bleached, chaotic, more or less bare of
ornament. This is a man who has pared his life down to
very little.

(CONTINUED)
17.

29 CONTINUED: 29
CLARISSA puts down the flowers and goes to the blinds.

CLARISSA
Richard, it's a beautiful morning.
How about I let in a little light?

RICHARD
Is it still morning?

CLARISSA
It is.
CLARISSA raises one of the shades. RICHARD barely moves
to greet the light.

RICHARD
Have I died? Am I alive?

CLARISSA bends over and kisses his forehead.

RICHARD
Good morning, my dear.

CLARISSA
Any visitors?

RICHARD
Yes.

CLARISSA
Are they still here?

RICHARD
No. They've gone.

CLARISSA
How did they look?

RICHARD
Today? Sort of like black fire.
I mean, sort of light and dark at
the same time. There was one a
bit like an electrified jellyfish.

CLARISSA looks at him a moment, then picks up the
flowers.

RICHARD
They were singing. It may have
been Greek.

CLARISSA
You don't sleep at all, do you?

(CONTINUED)
18.

29 CONTINUED: (2) 29

o RICHARD
. Oh, sleep.

CLARISSA has gone into the kitchen and calls back through
to him.

CLARISSA
I saw three bluebirds on the way
over. Do you think it's a good
omen?

RICHARD
Do you believe in omens? Omens
would mean someone was looking
after us, someone was watching.
Do you believe anyone's watching?
Do they send signs?

RICHARD makes a sort of grin, amused at the idea.

RICHARD
I mean, I'd love to believe it.
CLARISSA
The ceremony's at five. Do you
Co remember?
RICHARD

Do I? Do I remember?

CLARISSA
Then the party's after.

CLARISSA has arranged the flowers and now she reappears
in the doorway of Richard's room. CLARISSA looks at him
tolerantly, the long-suffering look of nurse to patient.
His complex cocktail of pills is laid out neatly ona
table nearby.

CLARISSA
They did bring you breakfast,
didn't they?

RICHARD
What a question. Of course.
CLARISSA
You did eat it, Richard?
RICHARD
Well can you see it? Is there any
o breakfast lying around?

CLARISSA
I can't see it.

RICHARD
Well, then, I must have eaten it,
mustn't I?

CLARISSA
I suppose.

RICHARD
Does it matter?

CLARISSA
Of course it matters. You know
what the doctors say. Have you
been skipping pills?

CLARISSA is frowning mistrustfully at the way the
cocktail is laid out on the table but RICHARD is suddenly
impatient, ignoring the question.

RICHARD
Clarissa, I can't take this.
CLARISSA
Take what?
RICHARD

Having to be proud and brave in
front of everybody.

CLARISSA
Honey, it's not a performance.

RICHARD
Of course it is. I got the prize
for my performance.

CLARISSA
Well, that is nonsense.

RICHARD
I got the prize for having AIDS
and going nuts and being brave
about it. I actually got the
prize for having come through.

CLARISSA
It's not true.

(CONTINUED)
29

20.

CONTINUED: (4) 29

RICHARD
For surviving. That's what I got
the prize for. You think they'd
give it to me if I were healthy?

CLARISSA
Well, yes, as a matter of fact I
do.

RICHARD looks at her with an ironic gleam of doubt.

RICHARD
Is it here somewhere?

CLARISSA
What?

RICHARD
The prize. I'd like to look at

CLARISSA
You haven't gotten it yet. It's
tonight.

RICHARD

Are you sure? I remember the
ceremony perfectly. I seem to
have fallen out of time.

CLARISSA waits a moment, trying to be patient.

CLARISSA
Richard, it's a party. It's only
a party. Populated entirely by
people who respect and admire you.

RICHARD
Ah, small party, is it? Select
party, is it?

CLARISSA
Your friends.

RICHARD
I thought I lost all my friends.
I drove my friends crazy.
RICHARD reaches out and touches the flowers.
RICHARD
‘Oh Mrs. Dalloway, always giving
parties to cover the silence...'

CLARISSA is stunned a moment by his unkindness, and then
rallies, keeping her anger at bay.

: CLARISSA
Richard, you won't need to do
anything. All you have to do is
appear, sit on the sofa. And I
will be there. This is a group of
people who want to tell you your
work's going to live.

RICHARD
Is it? Is my work going to live?

RICHARD looks at her without pity.

RICHARD
I can't go through with it,
Clarissa.

CLARISSA
Why do you say that?

RICHARD
I can't.

CLARISSA
Why?

RICHARD
Because I wanted to be a writer,
that's all.

CLARISSA
So?

RICHARD gets up, heaving himself across the room on a
crutch.

RICHARD
I wanted to write about it all.
Everything that's happening in a
moment. The way those flowers
looked when you carried them in
your arms -- this towel, how it
smells, how it feels -- this
thread -- all our feelings, yours
and mine. The history of who we
once were. Everything that's in
the world. Everything mixed up.
Like it's all mixed up now.

RICHARD'S eyes fill with tears.

RICHARD
And I failed. Whatever you start
with, it ends up so much less.
Sheer fucking pride and stupidity.

RICHARD slumps down again. CLARISSA watches, part
impatient, part helpless.

RICHARD
We want everything, don't we?
CLARISSA
Yes. I suppose we do.
RICHARD
You kissed me on a beach...
CLARISSA
Yes.
RICHARD
You remember?
CLARISSA
Of course.
RICHARD

How many years ago?
CLARISSA shakes her head, too overwhelmed to answer.

RICHARD
What did you want then?

Again, CLARISSA says nothing. She is as upset as he is.

RICHARD
Come here, come closer, would you
please?

CLARISSA

I'm right here.

RICHARD
Take my hand.

CLARISSA takes his painfully-thin hand, a handful of
twigs.

RICHARD
Would you be angry?

If you died? Would I be angry if
you died?

RICHARD
Who's this party for?

CLARISSA
What do you mean? Who's it for?
What are you asking? What are you
trying to say?

RICHARD
I'm not trying to say anything!
I'm saying!

CLARISSA is panicking now.

RICHARD
I think I'm only staying alive to
satisfy you.

CLARISSA is looking at him, aghast.

CLARISSA
So? Well? That's what we do.
That's what people do. They stay
alive for each other. The doctors
told you: you don't need to die.
The doctors told you that. You
can live like this for years.

RICHARD
Well exactly.

RICHARD smiles, CLARISSA bitterly shakes her head, firm

now.

CLARISSA
I don't accept this. I don't
accept what you're saying.

Oh, what? And it's you to decide

RICHARD

How many years, coming to the
apartment? What about your own
life? What about Sally? Just
wait till I die. Then you'll have
to think of yourself.

CLARISSA doesn't answer. RICHARD smiles, sure of his
point.

RICHARD
How are you going to like that?

CLARISSA lets go of his hand, disturbed. RICHARD just
looks at her. CLARISSA gets up and stands a moment,
shaken. Then speaks quietly.

CLARISSA
Richard, it would be great if you
did come. If you felt well enough
to come. Just to let you know:
I'm making the crab thing. Not
that I imagine it makes any
difference.

RICHARD
Of course it makes a difference.
I love the crab thing.

CLARISSA is about to leave but RICHARD calls across to
her.

RICHARD
Clarissa?

CLARISSA
Yes?

RICHARD raises his head slightly for her to kiss him.
CLARISSA puts her lips next to his, with great
tenderness, not to hurt him. Then she squeezes his
shoulder.

RICHARD
Wonderful.

INT. APARTMENT BLOCK - ELEVATOR - DAY 30

CLARISSA, in her dark glasses, gets back into the freight
elevator, distraught from her encounter. She throws her
head back in despair at the side of the elevator. The
elevator goes down.

INT. HOGARTH HOUSE - VIRGINIA'S STUDY - DAY (1923) 31

VIRGINIA WOOLF is still at her desk, just as before. But
now the first pages of her notebook are filled with
handwriting. She speaks again to herself.

VIRGINIA
It's on this day, this day of all
days, her fate becomes clear to
her...

At once there is a loud KNOCK at the door, interrupting
VIRGINIA'S thoughts. Without waiting for an answer,
NELLY BOXALL appears. She is large, red-faced, regal, in
cook's apron.

NELLY
Excuse me, Mrs. Woolf, Mr. Woolf
said I was to come and speak to
you.

VIRGINIA
I can't imagine why he said that.

NELLY, unyielding, ignores VIRGINIA'S tone.

VIRGINIA
I'm nearly finished, Nelly.
Please attend me in the kitchen
and I'll be down very soon.

INT. HOGARTH HOUSE - CORRIDOR AND KITCHEN - DAY 32

VIRGINIA is coming downstairs. She stops, standing with
her back against the wall in the corridor outside the
kitchen, preparing herself for the encounter ahead. From
inside she can hear NELLY chattering freely with LOTTIE.

NELLY
What happens is, she says she
wants something then it turns out
she doesn’t...

LOTTIE
Well she never does, does she?
Never wants anything.

NELLY
Especially when she's asked for
it. That's a sure sign.

LOTTIE
I wish I'd been there.

NELLY
Yeah, I wish you had, too.

The two women laugh cheerfully. VIRGINIA summons up her
courage.

LOTTIE
Did you give her that look? That
sort of look you do?

NELLY
I said, 'Madam'...

But before Nelly can finish, VIRGINIA has stepped into
the open door and cut her off. NELLY is rolling out
pastry and cutting huge chunks of raw lamb. Beside her,
LOTTIE is working. She is in her teens, dressed
identically to NELLY, and collusive, not missing a trick.

VIRGINIA
Yes, Nelly, tell me, how can I
help?

VIRGINIA moves towards the table, trying to take charge
of her formidable servant.

NELLY
It's about lunch.

VIRGINIA
Ah, yes.

NELLY
I just had to go ahead on my own.

VIRGINIA
I understand.

VIRGINIA recoils slightly at the sight and smell of raw

meat.
VIRGINIA
You chose a pie?
NELLY
I chose a lamb pie.
VIRGINIA
That seems suitable.
NELLY
You being so busy with your

writing.
VIRGINIA does not respond. LOTTIE works on, impassive.

NELLY
I had no instructions. And I
thought some of them yellow pears
for pudding, unless you'd like
something fancier.

VIRGINIA
Pears will be fine.

NELLY lifts up pastry and folds it into the pan, a figure
of righteous hard work.

VIRGINIA
You do remember that my sister is
coming at four with the family?

NELLY
Yes, ma'am, I haven't forgotten.

VIRGINIA
China tea, I think. And ginger.

NELLY hesitates in her actions. LOTTIE registers the
moment also.

NELLY
Ginger, madam?

VIRGINIA
I'd like to give the children a

NELLY

We'd have to go to London for
ginger, ma'am I haven't finished
this and there's the rest of the
lunch to get ready.

VIRGINIA steels herself, not rising to the bait.

VIRGINIA
The twelve-thirty train, Nelly,
will get you to London just after
one. If you return on the two-
thirty, you will be back in
Richmond soon after three. Do I

miscalculate?

NELLY
No.

VIRGINIA
Well then.

It's a trial of strength. NELLY doesn't move.

VIRGINIA
Well then? Is something detaining
you, Nelly?

VIRGINIA is tense. But she knows she's won. NELLY puts
down the rolling pin.

VIRGINIA
I can't think of anything more
exhilarating than a trip to
London.

INT. HOGARTH HOUSE - PRINTING ROOM - DAY 33

VIRGINIA descends the stairs to the print room. The room
is overflowing with manuscripts. In the middle of the
untidiness, LEONARD sits with a scowl, scrutinizing
proofs. Beside him, a handsome young man, RALPH
PARTRIDGE, is working at the inky hand-operated printing
press.

VIRGINIA
Good morning.

RALPH
Good morning, Mrs. Woolf.

RALPH looks up, relieved to see her. The atmosphere is
extremely tense.

LEONARD
We shall publish no more new
authors. I have to tell you I
have discovered ten errors in the
first proof.

VIRGINIA
Lucky to have found them, then,
Leonard.

LEONARD
‘Paschendale was a charnel-house
from which no min returned.' Do
you think it is possible that bad
writing actually attracts a higher
incidence of error?

VIRGINIA is smiling.
VIRGINIA

If it's all right, I thought I
might take a short walk.

LEONARD
Not far?
VIRGINIA
No. Just for air.
LEONARD now gives imperceptible consent -- just with his
eyes.
LEONARD

Go then. If I could walk mid-
morning, I'd be a very happy man.

VIRGINIA pauses a moment at the barb, then goes. RALPH
watches.

34 EXT. PARADISE ROAD - DAY 34

There is a school next to Hogarth House and children in
the playground. VIRGINIA comes along the pavement in
front of the railings, lost in a world of her own. She
walks a little, then stops, without realizing, and talks
to herself.

34 CONTINUED: 34

VIRGINIA
She'll die. She's going to die.
That's what's going to happen.

A couple of people pass, noticing that this vague,
genteel woman is talking to herself. Now VIRGINIA stares
at a couple of little SCHOOLGIRLS in the playground, one
earnestly whispering to the other, both intent.

VIRGINIA
That's it. She will kill herself.
She will kill herself over
something which doesn't seem to
matter.

35 INT. BROWNS' HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY (1951) 35

LAURA is still in her dressing gown, but now with an
apron tied over it. She is sitting frowning at a recipe
book on the surface in front of her. Beside her she has
assembled all the elements of cake-making -- eggs, tins,
sugar and a series of pale blue bowls. But the endeavor
is stalled. RICHIE is standing beside her, waiting
patiently.

LAURA
Let's think.

RICHIE
You grease the pan, Mommy.

LAURA
I know you grease the pan, sweet
one. Even Mommy knows that.

Decisively she reaches to assemble the elements. RICHIE
frowns, watching.

LAURA
Okay. This is what we're going to
do. Flour. Bowl. Sifter.

for him to shake out. RICHIE concentrates with great
seriousness. Flour falls through the sieve in a fine
white powder into a blue china bowl.

LAURA has

LAURA
Next -- now this is the next
thing. I'm going to show you.
The next thing is we measure out
the cups.

RICHIE
Mommy, it isn't that difficult.

LAURA
I know, sweet pea. I know it
isn't difficult. It's just... I
want to do this for Daddy.

RICHIE
Because it's his birthday.

LAURA
That's right. We're baking the
cake to show him we love him.

RICHIE
Otherwise he won't know we love
him?

LAURA looks at her son a moment.

LAURA

INT. CLARISSA'S APARTMENT - DAY 36

CLARISSA is sitting immobilized in the second bedroom.
The room is stacked with spare furniture which has been
cleared away to make room for the party. CLARISSA has
sat down on a hard chair, still trying to recover from
her earlier encounter with RICHARD. Through the front
door, full of cheerfulness, comes SALLY, carrying armfuls
of dry cleaning and a load of Balducci bags.

SALLY
I got all the stuff. My God, what
a zoo. Why do people have to talk
about dry cleaning? I mean what
is there to talk about?

SALLY has gone straight through to their own bedroom to
put the dry cleaning down on the bed. Now SALLY has come
out into the corridor and is heading with the shopping
bags towards the kitchen.

SALLY
I bought you some flowers.

SALLY sees she has been pre-empted by the abundant
flowers CLARISSA has already brought home. She throws
her own offering down beside them.

SALLY
Where are you?

CLARISSA
In here.

SALLY has put the bags down in the kitchen, and is
beginning to get oranges out of them.

SALLY
I got somebody to cover for me at
work. I'll be with you all night.

SALLY opens the fridge door and starts putting oranges
inside. She frowns slightly at the silence from
CLARISSA.

SALLY
Are you all right?

CLARISSA
Sure.

Sally smiles to herself, not worried by CLARISSA'S slump.

SALLY

INT. BROWNS' HOUSE - DAY (1951) 37

LAURA is looking at the finished cake. It isn't what
she'd hoped. She has tried to pipe out the message
"HAPPY BIRTHDAY DAN" on top. But the lettering is
clumsy, and there are crumbs in the icing. LAURA speaks
under her breath.

LAURA
It didn't work. Damn! It didn't
work.

At once there is the sound of the back DOORBELL. LAURA
looks, seeing the outline of a woman at the door. She
begins to panic, checking in the mirror, alarmed to see
herself, still in her bathrobe, looking like a distressed
person. RICHIE has come running in, holding a red
plastic toy he has been playing with.

RICHIE
Mommy! Mommy! There's someone at
the door.
INT./EXT. BROWNS' HOUSE - DAY 38

Just a few seconds later. LAURA swings open the door,
having made a hurried attempt at normality. Her hair is
tidier, but she is still in the robe. At the back door.

KITTY is standing, a little younger than LAURA, and more
confident, with a voluptuous, good-looking presence:
well made-up, well turned out, at ease.

little wild-eyed, desperate.

LAURA
Why, sure.

KITTY
Hi, Richie!

LAURA

Sit down. I've got coffee on.
Would you like some?

KITTY
Please.

RICHIE is on the floor, observing from a distance. KITTY
sits at the kitchen table and sees the sugary heap.

KITTY
Oh look -- you made a cake.

LAURA
I know. It didn't work. I
thought it was going to work. I
thought it would work better than
that.

KITTY
All right, but you have other
virtues. And Dan loves you so
much he won't even notice.
Whatever you do, he's going to say
it's wonderful.

LAURA looks at her reproachfully and pushes KITTY'S
coffee across to her.

KITTY
Well it's true.
LAURA
Does Ray have a birthday?
KITTY
Sure he does.
LAURA
When is it?
KITTY

September. We go to the country

the day with fifty people.

LAURA

Ray's got a lot of friends.

You can say that again. They came
home from the war, they deserved
it, didn't they? After what
they'd been through?

KITTY
What did they deserve?
LAURA
I don't know. Us, I guess. All

LAURA gestures ‘round the prosperous surroundings.
KITTY nods at the copy of Mrs. Dalloway on the kitchen

KITTY

Oh. You're reading a book?
LAURA

Yeah.
KITTY

What's this one about?

LAURA
Oh, it's about this woman who's
incredibly... well, she's a
hostess and she's incredibly
confident. And she's going to
give a party. And... maybe,
because she's confident, everyone
thinks she's fine. But she isn’t.

in my uterus. They're going to go

KITTY
This afternoon.

LAURA just looks at her, not knowing how to respond.

KITTY
I need you to feed the dog.

LAURA
Of course.

There's a moment's silence. KITTY puts her front door
key on the kitchen table.

LAURA
Is that what you came to ask?

KITTY just looks at her, not answering.

LAURA

I couldn't conceive. You're
lucky, Laura. I don't think you
can call yourself a woman until
you're a mother.

LAURA looks down at her own stomach. KITTY looks away.

KITTY
The joke is: all my life I could
do everything -- I mean, I can do
anything -- really -- I never had
any trouble -- except the one
thing I wanted.

LAURA
Yes.

KITTY
That's all.

LAURA

Well, at least now they'll be able
to deal with it.

an imaginary stain.

KITTY
I'm not worried. What would be

KITTY is losing it now, fighting to control her feelings.

KITTY
I mean, of course I'm worried for
Ray.

LAURA

Come here.

But in fact it is LAURA who gets up and goes over to
KITTY. She bends down and embraces her. After a moment,
KITTY slips her arms ‘round LAURA'S waist. The two women
hold onto each other, LAURA almost kneeling to be at
KITTY'S level. Then, without planning it, LAURA kisses
KITTY'S forehead, lingeringly. KITTY lets her.

KITTY
I'm doing fine. Really.

LAURA
I know you are.

KITTY
If anything. I'm more worried
about Ray. He's not good at this
stuff.

LAURA
Forget about Ray for a minute.
Just forget about Ray.

KITTY'S face is against LAURA'S breasts. She seems to

relax into her. LAURA lifts KITTY'S face, and puts her
lips against hers. They both know what they are doing.
They kiss, letting themselves go a moment. Then LAURA

pulls away.

KITTY
You're sweet.

There is a brief moment, then LAURA turns and her eye
falls on RICHIE who is on the floor with his toys. They
had both forgotten him. He has watched throughout.
KITTY stands up.

What? I didn't mind what?

LAURA stands, anxious.

LAURA
Do you want me to drive you?

KITTY
I think I'll feel better if I
drive myself.

LAURA

Kitty, it's going to be all right.
KITTY

Of course it is. 'Bye.

KITTY goes out. LAURA stands in the middle of the
kitchen. She looks down at RICHIE who is still looking
Silently up at her.

LAURA
What? What do you want?

It is said just sharply enough to make RICHIE turn and go
silently to his own room. LAURA looks at him going, then
walks across to the kitchen top. Then, needing to do
something decisive, LAURA picks up the cake which is
cooling on a rack. LAURA opens a pedal bin with her
foot, and slides the cake off the plate cleanly into the
bin. It makes a satisfyingly-solid noise as it lands.

out to play in the garden as VIRGINIA arrives, followed

children who are gathered in a group near the bushes
‘round something not yet seen. JULIAN BELL is 15, sturdy
and muscular; QUENTIN BELL is 13, looking like a young
soldier; and ANGELICA GARNETT is an exceptionally-
beautiful little girl of five.

VANESSA
Hello, changelings, what have you
got? What have you found?

JULIAN

We've found a bird.
VANESSA

Did you? Where did you find that?
JULIAN

I think it must have fallen from

the tree.

QUENTIN holds a dying thrush out in his hands, a bundle
of gray feathers.

VANESSA
Goodness, just look at him.

QUENTIN
He's alive. I think we might be
able to save him.

VANESSA
Save him?

VANESSA frowns.

VANESSA
I think you have to be careful,
Quentin. There's a time to die.
It may be the bird's time.

Fearing such talk may upset her, VANESSA instinctively
squeezes VIRGINIA'S hand.

: JULIAN
Come on. Let's pick some grass.
Let's pick some grass to make a
grave.

VANESSA is about to protest, but JULIAN interrupts.
JULIAN

I'm just saying then at least
there'll be a bed for him to die

on.
QUENTIN
Come on, Nessa, let's make a
grave.
VANESSA

Oh God, oh very well. I'm coming.
Wait for me, then. Angelica,
you'll be all right?

VANESSA runs off with the boys.

42 EXT. HOGARTH HOUSE - GARDEN - DAY 42

ANGELICA is making the little bed of twigs. The others
have gone off to pick grass. VIRGINIA appears above
ANGELICA with some yellow roses.

VIRGINIA

Do you think she'd like roses?
ANGELICA

Yes.
VIRGINIA

Let's put roses 'round the grass.

VIRGINIA kneels down next to ANGELICA and helps her
arrange the little bed. The bird is lying to one side.
In the distance the boys are calling:

BOYS (0.S.)
Mother. There's some good stuff
over here. Mother! Mother!

ANGELICA
Is it a she?

(CONTINUED)
42

46.
CONTINUED: 42

VIRGINIA
Yes. The females are larger and
less colorful.

The sticks, grass and leaves are now laid out in a rough
circle. ANGELICA'S hands have the dead bird protected
inside them as she lays down the thrush, arranging her
feet under her. ANGELICA and VIRGINIA decorate the
circle of leaves with roses.

ANGELICA
What happens when we die?

VIRGINIA
What happens? We return to the
place we came from.

ANGELICA
I don't remember where I came
from.

VIRGINIA
Nor do I.

ANGELICA frowns, trying to understand.

ANGELICA
She looks very small.

VIRGINIA
Yes. That's one of the things
that happens. We look smaller.

ANGELICA
But very peaceful.

VIRGINIA smiles at ANGELICA. Suddenly VANESSA arrives
with the boys, her energy breaking up the moment of
quiet.

VANESSA
Is it done? Have we finished? Is
the bird funeral complete? Have
bird obsequies been done?

VIRGINIA
They have.

VANESSA
Good. Very well then. Are we to
be denied tea altogether for
coming so early?

ANGELICA runs off, happy at the job done. But VIRGINIA
doesn't yet move.

VIRGINIA
No. Of course not.

VANESSA
Well, then. Come on, boys.

VANESSA walks off up the lawn with JULIAN and QUENTIN.
They are all chattering as they go.

JULIAN
Where's Nelly gone?
VANESSA
She had to go to London to get
ginger.
JULIAN
Did that make her angry?
VANESSA
Virginia says very.
QUENTIN
I like it when Nelly gets angry.

It's funny.

Then it's silent. VIRGINIA is left alone. She has not
moved. She is still looking at the bird's grave. The

bird is perfectly at peace and surrounded with petals.

VIRGINIA looks. Slowly, VIRGINIA closes her eyes. Her
face becomes a death mask.

INT. BROWNS' HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY (1951) 43

LAURA is lain out on the bed, an identical look on her
face to VIRGINIA'S. Then, impulsively, she gets up from
the bed.

INT. BROWNS' HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY 44

RICHIE is sitting by himself playing on the carpet with
his toys. He looks up, missing nothing, as LAURA comes
out of the bedroom. She smiles absently at him, and
walks across the living room to pick up the tapestry bag
which is lying on a chair. She takes it with her and
goes into the bathroom.

INT. BROWNS' HOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY 45

LAURA opens the mirrored cupboard above the sink. In it,
there are a few odd bottles of aspirin, etc. She reaches
for some bottles of prescribed sleeping pills. She opens
the tapestry bag, puts the bottles inside and goes out.

INT. BROWNS' HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY 46

LAURA comes out of the bedroom with the tapestry bag.
RICHIE looks up again, trying to puzzle out where she has
been. LAURA heads straight for the kitchen, where she
puts the bag on a high surface, out of the child's reach.
LAURA reaches once more for the flour and eggs.

LAURA
Hey, bug, I've got this idea.
We're going to make another cake.
We're going to make a better one.

RICHIE
What happened to the first one?

LAURA smiles at him as if everything were completely
normal.

LAURA
Then after that, I think we should
go out.

EXT. CLARISSA'S APARTMENT - DAY (2001) 47

At once a man's finger pressing the intercom. LOUIS
WATERS is leonine, silvery, handsome, in his late 40s,
casually but perfectly dressed: a once-startlingly good-
looking man, now a little faded. He is nervous. It's
taken him an effort to RING the BELL. After a moment he
hears CLARISSA'S voice.

CLARISSA (V.0O.)

Yes?

LOUIS
Clarissa, it's Louis. Louis

CLARISSA

Louis? My God. You're early.

LOUIS
Do you mind? Is it all right?

48 INT. CLARISSA'S APARTMENT - VESTIBULE - DAY 48

CLARISSA has pressed the BUZZER and LOUIS is coming into
the vestibule of the building. As he does, CLARISSA
swings open the door of the apartment to greet him. She
has an apron around her waist and green plastic gloves
on. Her hair is a mess and LOUIS has plainly interrupted
her in mid-work. She is listening to a CD, which is
BOOMING out behind her.

CLARISSA
Why should I mind? I'm delighted.

LOUIS
Well now.

They fall into each other's arms, embracing. They hold
each other some time, with real need. Then CLARISSA lets
go and sees that Louis' eyes are moist.

LOUIS
I feel I'm interrupting.
CLARISSA
Why, no.
LOUIS

I know the ceremony's not till
five, but I flew in this morning.

CLARISSA stands a moment, shaking her head.
CLARISSA
Richard's going to be thrilled.
He'll be thrilled to see you.

LOUIS
You think so?

CLARISSA
Of course. Of course he will.

There's just a moment's hesitation.

CLARISSA
What are we doing? We should go
in.

LOUIS
Oh. It's one of those cities
people tell you to like.

LOUIS stops a moment looking at a framed photograph of
the young RICHARD, looking handsome, healthy and young.

CLARISSA
Richard said he thought you were
happy out there.

LOUIS
Oh great. So now the illness
makes him psychic?

CLARISSA hands him his water.
CLARISSA
Louis, you have to prepare
yourself. He's very changed.

LOUIS has picked out a copy of RICHARD'S book from
CLARISSA'S shelves. CLARISSA goes back to her cooking.

LOUIS
I read the book...
CLARISSA
Oh, God!
LOUIS

Exactly. I thought you were meant
to do more than just change
people's names.

A whole chapter about 'Should she

doesn't!

CLARISSA smiles, but LOUIS isn't amused.

CLARISSA

His mother kills herself.

LOUIS
Yeah. Sure. His mother. But
still for no reason.

CLARISSA
Well...

LOUIS
Out of the blue.

LOUIS seems annoyed, but CLARISSA speaks quietly, trying
to reach him now.

CLARISSA

liked it. I know. Only one thing
upset me.

LOUIS
Oh yeah? What was that? What
upset you?

hurt.

CLARISSA
Well... that there wasn't more
about you.

LOUIS
That's kind.

LOUIS looks up, caught off balance. Now he is moved, and
risks a confidence.

LOUIS
I went back to Wellfleet.
CLARISSA
You did?
LOUIS

One day. I didn't tell you.

CLARISSA
No. But then I never see you.

LOUIS
You remember the house? It's
still there.

Louis stops, thinking.

CLARISSA
I think you're courageous.

LOUIS
Courageous? Why?

CLARISSA
To dare to go visit.

LOUIS frowns.

CLARISSA
What I mean is: to face the fact
we've lost those feelings forever.

CLARISSA'S eyes are full of tears, and she seems to have
forgotten LOUIS is there.

CLARISSA
Shit.

strange sort of mood. I seem to

LOUIS
Clarissa, I shouldn't have come.

CLARISSA holds out a hand to stop him coming over to
comfort her.

CLARISSA
No, it's not you. Really. It's
more... it's like having a
presentiment. Do you know what
I'm saying?

CLARISSA wipes her eyes, tries to make light of it.
CLARISSA
Oh, God, it's probably just nerves
about the party. Bad hostess.

Suddenly CLARISSA sinks to the floor, not able to control
herself anymore.

LOUIS
Clarissa, what's happening?

CLARISSA
Jesus!

LOUIS

What is it?

CLARISSA has gone away to the wall, like a child now,
with her hand raised to hide her face.

CLARISSA
Oh, God!

LOUIS
Do you want me to go?

CLARISSA tires desperately to turn her grief to anger.
CLARISSA
No. Don't go. Explain to me!
Why is this happening?

her in his arms.

LOUIS stands useless. CLARISSA looks at him a moment
through her tears. Then she tries desperately.

CLARISSA
It's too much. It's just too
much. You fly in from San
Francisco. I've been nursing
Richard for years...

LOUIS
I know.

CLARISSA
And all that time I've held myself
together... no problem...

There's a silence. Neither of them can say anything.
CLARISSA just looks pleadingly at him from the floor.

LOUIS
Yes.

‘ Neither speaks. CLARISSA wipes her tears with her
sleeve. She's quiet when she talks.

CLARISSA
One morning. In Wellfleet. You
were there. We were all there.
I'd been sleeping with him and I
was on the back porch. He came
out. He put his hand on my
shoulder. 'Good morning, Mrs.
Dalloway.'

CLARISSA is lost a moment in the memory.

CLARISSA
And ever since then, I've been
stuck.
LOUIS
Stuck?

CLARISSA
Anyway, it doesn't matter. It was
you he stayed with. It was you he
lived with. I had one summer.
You'll see when he comes. He's
still Richard. His mind wanders
and he's in a lot of pain. But
there's some constant quality.
There's his Richard-ness.

LOUIS moves towards her, careful about what he wants to
spell out.

LOUIS
The day I left him I got ona
train and made my way across
Europe. I felt free for the first
time in years.

eo There is a silence. CLARISSA stares, taking in what
LOUIS has just said. Then she gets up, trying to get
back to normal.

CLARISSA
So. You must tell me about San
Francisco.

LOUIS

What's to tell? I still teach
drama to idiots. Mostly.

CLARISSA
They can't all be idiots.

All those arguments, doors being
slammed... well, you know what

CLARISSA says nothing.

CLARISSA goes to the sink. LOUIS is suddenly
embarrassed.

CLARISSA
Ridiculous. Fortunate, too.

51 INT. BROWNS' HOUSE - DAY (1951) 51

LAURA takes a second cake out of the oven and sets it
down on a cake rack. She looks at it a moment. It is
much better than the first. It reads HAPPY BIRTHDAY DAN
and is fringed with yellow roses. LAURA takes off her
oven gloves and reaches for the tapestry bag. She goes
out.

52 INT. CAR - DAY 52

The tapestry bag lands with a wham! on the back seat of
the car. LAURA then bundles a rather surprised-looking
RICHIE into the passenger seat. Then LAURA goes 'round
and gets in the driver's side.

LAURA
I'm going to leave you at Mrs.
Latch's. I have to do something.

LAURA is dressed and made-up, armored to go out into the
world. RICHIE is looking at her as she STARTS the CAR.

RICHIE
Mommy, I don't want to go.

LAURA
You have to. I'm sorry. I have
to do something before Daddy comes
home.

They drive off down the suburban street, fringed with
palm trees.

EXT. MRS. LATCH'S HOUSE - DAY 53

A cute suburban house with plaster squirrels on the gable
over the garage. MRS. LATCH, a big, florid woman in
Bermuda shorts, opens the door. RICHIE is holding
LAURA'S hand, and looking very reluctant to go into the
house.

MRS. LATCH
Hello.

LAURA
Hi, Mrs. Latch. My boy's not very
happy.

RICHIE

Mommy, I don't want to do this.

LAURA
I have to go, honey.

LAURA stoops down to his level and kisses him.

MRS. LATCH
Your mommy has things she must do.
If you come in, I got cookies.

LAURA takes him so that she can look him directly in the
eye.

MRS. LATCH reaches out and takes RICHIE'S hand. Turned
away now from her son, LAURA walks across the lawn back
to the car. Without warning, her face crumples in tears,
but as she reaches the car she wipes her eyes with her
hand to hide her distress. Then she turns back to wave.

LAURA
Honey!

RICHIE waves back from the step. LAURA quickly gets into
the car, grinning at him. She can barely get the key in
the starter, but when she does, she turns and drives
away.

INT./EXT. LAURA'S CAR (LOS ANGELES) - DAY 54

LAURA is beginning to drive away down the road. She
looks nervously in the rearview mirror. She sees RICHIE
run out of MRS. LATCH'S arms and into the road screaming
desperately.

RICHIE
Mommy! Mommy! No!

LAURA swings the wheel decisively to the left and with a
little SQUEAL of RUBBER, accelerates away. RICHIE stands
alone in the middle of the street.

INT./EXT. LAURA'S CAR - DAY 55

Now LAURA is cruising on a Los Angeles freeway. For a
moment, her higher speed and the freedom of the road
gives the feeling that she has successfully escaped.

INT. MRS. LATCH'S HOUSE - DAY 56

Back in the living room of Mrs. Latch's house, RICHIE
moodily gets out a building set and begins building a
small house. MRS. LATCH watches from the doorway.

INT. LAURA'S CAR - DAY 57

LAURA drives intently. She is aimless, distressed. But
then she looks to the side of the freeway where there is
a sign for the Normandy Hotel. Impulsively, with no pre-
planning, LAURA swings the car dangerously across lanes
and takes it out along the slipway towards the hotel.

RICHIE has finished the little house. Now he picks up
the complete building and tumbles it bad-temperedly back
into the box.

EXT. NORMANDY HOTEL (LOS ANGELES) - DAY 59

LAURA walks towards a huge wedding-cake hotel, a pseudo-
Spanish '50s palace. She carries no luggage except her
tapestry bag.

INT. NORMANDY HOTEL - ROOM - DAY 60

LAURA has checked into the hotel and is now standing in
the room she has reserved. It is featureless, anonymous
-- green spreads and candy wallpaper. LAURA is dropping
fifty cents into a HOTEL CLERK'S outstretched hand.

CLERK
Breakfast is served between seven
and eleven in the Regency Room.
There's a swimming pool at the
back, and the hotel is open for
twenty-four hours.

He pockets his tip.

CLERK
Thank you, ma'am. Is there
anything else you need?

LAURA hesitates a moment.

LAURA
Yes. No. Not to be disturbed.

He goes out. LAURA is left alone. She looks around the
room. There is a moment of silence, of relief. LAURA
looks ‘round, not quite knowing what to do next.

LAURA sits on the edge of the bed and opens her bag. She
takes out the pale green toilet bag and unzips it. She
takes the little rank of pill bottles out and sets them
down on the bed cover. As she does so, she sees her copy
of Mrs. Dalloway at the bottom of the tapestry bag.

INT. NORMANDY HOTEL - DAY (A FEW MINUTES LATER) 61
Now LAURA is stretched out reading on the bed, a pillow
against her back. AS LAURA reads her book, the text is
heard in VIRGINIA'S voice.

VIRGINIA (V.0O.)
Did it matter, then, she asked
herself, walking towards Bond
Street, did it matter that she
must inevitably cease
completely...

LAURA pulls her blouse out from her skirt to loosen it,
and puts her hand on her pregnant stomach.

VIRGINIA (V.0O.)
All this must go on without her;
did she resent it; or did it not
become consoling to believe that
death ended absolutely?

LAURA rubs her naked stomach slightly, feeling the child
within.

VIRGINIA (V.O.)
It is possible to die.

Suddenly brackish water floods from underneath, washing
up over the sides of the bed. LAURA, in her imagination,
sinks under the water, strewn with weeds, and then
drowns.

INT. HOGARTH HOUSE - DRAWING ROOM - DAY (1923) 62

VIRGINIA is sitting with VANESSA having tea. JULIAN and
QUENTIN are at the other end of the room. VIRGINIA is
completely lost in her own thoughts.

VIRGINIA (V.O.)
It is possible to die.

VIRGINIA turns her head and becomes aware that VANESSA
has been speaking. She only hears the end of what has
obviously been a long discourse.

VANESSA
... There was a lovely coat for
Angelica at Harrods, but then
nothing for the boys and it seemed
so unfair. Why should Angelica be
favored?

VIRGINIA does not reply.

ANGELICA runs across to VIRGINIA, who scoops her up and
puts her on her knee.

.

VANESSA
Your aunt's a very lucky woman,
Angelica, because she has two
lives. Most of us have only one.
But she has the life she leads and
she also has the book she's
writing. This makes her very
fortunate indeed.

VIRGINIA smiles at ANGELICA on her knee.

ANGELICA
What were you thinking about?

VIRGINIA

Oh. I was going to kill my heroine.
But I've changed my mind.

INT. NORMANDY HOTEL - ROOM - DAY (1951) 63
Back in the (dry) bedroom, LAURA is lying on the bed, the
pills still visible on the table beside her. She still
has the book in front of her, but she is not reading it.
She puts it to one side. Then she rubs her naked stomach
again. Her eyes fill with tears.
LAURA
I can't! I can't!
INT. HOGARTH HOUSE - DRAWING ROOM - DAY (1923) 64

VIRGINIA
I fear I may have to kill someone
else instead.

There is a car waiting outside which is being loaded.
QUENTIN, JULIAN and ANGELICA are all in front as VANESSA

VANESSA
It was a fascinating visit. They
enjoyed it thoroughly.

VIRGINIA
Do you have to go already? I do
wish you wouldn't go.

VANESSA
Why, Virginia, the last thing you
need is our noisiness. My
hopeless, clumsy boys.

VANESSA smiles at the lads.

VANESSA
Say good-bye, boys.

VIRGINIA
Good-bye, children.

The boys say "Good-bye" and "Good-bye, Aunt" and shake
VIRGINIA'S hand. They go out of the front door towards a
waiting taxi. VIRGINIA turns to her sister.

VIRGINIA
And you will return to what? To
concerts? To parties?

VANESSA
Tonight? An insufferable dinner
which not even you could envy,
Virginia.

VIRGINIA
But I do.

Suddenly she looks VANESSA in the eye.

VIRGINIA
Kiss me.

It starts as a formal kiss, but then VIRGINIA, shockingly
direct, pushes her lips against VANESSA. VIRGINIA holds
her mouth a moment. When they part, VANESSA is
overwhelmed, blushing at the power of VIRGINIA'S need.

VIRGINIA
Did you think I was better? Say
something, Nessa. Didn't you
think I seemed better?

day escape?
There is a silence, the two women still eye to eye.

VANESSA
One day. One.

VIRGINIA
Nessa...

There's a short silence, broken by the sound of a car
horn outside. .

VANESSA
Come, Angelica. We must go.

VANESSA and ANGELICA go out of the door. ANGELICA. turns
back and waves.

ANGELICA
Good-bye.

VIRGINIA
Good-bye, little girl.

NELLY, returning from outside, closes the door and gives
VIRGINIA a look as she returns to the kitchen. VIRGINIA
stands alone in the hall.

LEONARD is standing at the end of the corridor, watching.

EXT. HOGARTH HOUSE - DAY 66
The boys are already in the taxi. VANESSA, obviously
upset, wordlessly ushers ANGELICA to get in. Then she

gets in herself, and draws ANGELICA to her.

VANESSA
Here. On my knee. Stay close.

VANESSA signals to the DRIVER.

VANESSA

LOUIS lets the outside door of CLARISSA'S apartment
building close behind him. He stands a moment at the top
of the steps, full of relief to have left. Then,
gratefully, he goes on his way.

INT. CLARISSA'S APARTMENT - DAY 68

CLARISSA closes the door of the apartment and goes back
into her living room, intending to resume her

preparations for the party. But instead she stands, in
the middle of the room, now bereft. She does not move.

INT. HOGARTH HOUSE - DAY (1923) 69

VIRGINIA walks alone up the staircase. At the half-way
landing there is a large window. VIRGINIA stops.
Outside, she can see the happy family departing -- the
three children chattering excitedly to VANESSA. Their
car disappears. VIRGINIA watches.

EXT. TENTH STREET - DAY (2001) 70

A handsome, 19-year-old GIRL, lush and strong, in combat
trousers and sweater comes along Tenth Street. She
crackles with health like an Irish farm-girl. She bounds
up the steps of CLARISSA'S apartment block and lets
herself in with her key.

INT. CLARISSA'S APARTMENT - DAY 71

The girl is CLARISSA'S daughter JULIA and now she is
letting herself in to the apartment.

JULIA

Don't start. I know. It's just
incredibly important. Because

JULIA eases out of her mother's needy embrace, blithely
to take off her backpack.

JULIA
What should I do? Chairs?

CLARISSA
Oh. Can you clear my desk?

CLARISSA'S desk is covered in books which JULIA now
clears by carrying them through to the bedroom. As she
goes she calls back to her mother.

JULIA
I bumped into Louis Waters.

CLARISSA
You did. Where?

JULIA
In the street. They're all here
aren't they? The ghosts. The
ghosts are assembling for the
party. He's weird.

JULIA on her way through sees her mother's face.
JULIA

You mean you can't see that? You
can't see Louis Waters is weird?

CLARISSA
I can see that he's sad.

JULIA
All your friends are sad.

JULIA expects CLARISSA to laugh, but then stops, books in
hand, seeing how preoccupied her mother is.

JULIA
You've been crying. What's
happening?

CLARISSA
All it is: I looked around this
room. I thought, I'm giving a
party. All I want to do is just
give a party.

JULIA
And?

CLARISSA shakes her head, angry with herself.
CLARISSA
I know why he does it! He does it
deliberately!

JULIA
Who? Is this Richard?

CLARISSA
Of course!

JULIA smiles to herself, as if she's used to it.
CLARISSA

He looks at me. He did it this
morning. He gave me that look.

JULIA
What look?
CLARISSA
Oh, to say: ‘You're trivial, your

life is so trivial. Daily stuff,
schedules. Parties. Details.'

CLARISSA turns, suddenly protesting.
CLARISSA
That's what he means by it.
That's what he's saying!
JULIA
Mom, it only matters if you think
it's true.

CLARISSA looks at her, taken aback by what JULIA has
said. They both become quiet now.

JULIA
Well? Do you? Tell me.

There's a silence.

CONTINUED: (3) 71

CLARISSA
When I'm with him, then, yes, I'm
living. That's what I feel. And
when I'm not, yes, things seem
kind of silly.

JULIA walks away to the bedroom, struck by her mother's
tactlessness.

CLARISSA
I don't mean with you. Never with
you. But the rest of it.

JULIA
Sally?

CLARISSA
The rest of it. False comfort.

CLARISSA has followed JULIA into the bedroom and now they
lie down, side by side, on the bed.

CLARISSA
If you say to me: when was I
happiest?

JULIA
Mom...

CLARISSA

Tell me the moment you were
happiest...

JULIA
I know. It was years ago.
CLARISSA
Yes.
JULIA

All you're saying is, you were
once young.

CLARISSA smiles at JULIA'S remark. But JULIA knows it is
still not resolved.

CLARISSA
I remember one morning. Getting
up at dawn. There was such a
sense of possibility. We were
going to do everything. Do you
know that feeling?

CONTINUED: (4) 71
JULIA nods, finally allowing what her mother is saying.

CLARISSA
I remember thinking: 'This is the
beginning of happiness.' That's
what I thought. 'So this is the
feeling. This is where it starts.
And of course there'll always be
more.' It never occurred to me:
it wasn't the beginning. It was
happiness. It was the moment,
right then.

There is a silence. JULIA looks thoughtfully at her
mother. Then the DOOR BUZZER sounds. CLARISSA goes to
the intercom, and a VOICE calls through: "Caterers."

INT. HOGARTH HOUSE - KITCHEN - EVENING 71

Beef being dumped down into a frying pan filled with
onions and being vigorously stirred, a pan of beef bones
bubbling next to it. NELLY and LOTTIE working together
in the well-lit kitchen, a whole range of vegetables laid
out on the chopping boards for supper.

NELLY, who misses nothing, looks up from her cooking at
the sound of someone coming downstairs. The kitchen door
is open and gives onto the stairway. A figure moves
quickly by, but NELLY sees. VIRGINIA is heading out in a
long coat. LOTTIE has also looked up, the two of them
noting VIRGINIA'S departure.

EXT. HOGARTH HOUSE - EVENING 72

VIRGINIA in her coat hurrying out, trying to make sure
she is not noticed. She moves quickly through the
garden. In the distance, LEONARD is digging at the edge
of the garden. But his back is turned and he does not
notice her. She hastens towards the gate, and out into
the road outside.

EXT. RICHMOND STATION - EVENING 73
It is a summer evening, darkening a little, as VIRGINIA
comes to the Victorian portico of Richmond station. Two
MEN, returning from London, pass, and she catches a whiff
of their conversation:

MEN
I told him that's what he had to
do and if he didn't like it that
was his business.

VIRGINIA passes them, trying not to be noticed, going
into the hall, a fine canopied space of glass and arched
ironwork. She goes to the ticket booth.

VIRGINIA
I need a ticket to London, please.

CLERK
Yes, madam. A single or a return?

INT. HOGARTH HOUSE - EVENING 74

In a presentiment of what will happen again in 18 years’
time LEONARD WOOLF comes in from the garden. It's a
different house and a different hallway, but the action
is the same. LEONARD sits to put on his slippers,
hearing the sounds of the house. Then, as if noticing
something, frowns.

INT. HOGARTH HOUSE - KITCHEN - EVENING 75

LEONARD appears at the kitchen door. NELLY is standing
behind her stew.

LEONARD
Ah, Nelly, good evening. I was
wondering if you'd seen Mrs.
Woolf.

NELLY
I thought you knew, sir. Mrs.
Woolf has gone out.

EXT. HOGARTH HOUSE - GARDEN - EVENING 76
LEONARD WOOLF, in blind panic, fleeing the house, not in

a coat, just out into the garden, and away off down the
road.

EXT. PARADISE ROAD - EVENING 77

A middle-aged man, LEONARD WOOLF, running in his
slippers, vest and corduroy jacket, charging down the
hill towards the town.
78

71.
EXT. RICHMOND STATION - PLATFORM - EVENING 78

LEONARD comes down the steps towards the railway
platform. He sees VIRGINIA sitting rather conspicuously
by herself on a bench at the end of the platform. A
train has just gone, so there is not another traveler in
sight. The railway line stretches away to London, empty
and quiet. VIRGINIA is trying not to be self-conscious,
but she is tense. She turns.

VIRGINIA
Ah Mr. Woolf, what an unexpected
pleasure.

LEONARD

And perhaps you could tell me
exactly what you think you're
doing.

VIRGINIA
What I was doing? Why --

LEONARD
I went to look for you and you
weren't there.

LEONARD moves towards her. VIRGINIA stays calm,
resisting his panic.

VIRGINIA
You were working in the garden. I
didn't wish to disturb you.

LEONARD
You disturb me when you disappear.

VIRGINIA
I didn't disappear. I went for a
walk.

LEONARD
A walk? Is that all?

VIRGINIA doesn't answer.

LEONARD
Is that all? Just a walk?

They have neither of them moved. LEONARD is firm now.

LEONARD
Virginia, Nelly is cooking dinner.
She has already had a difficult
day. We must go home. We must
eat Nelly's dinner. It is our
obligation to eat Nelly's dinner.

(CONTINUED)
78

CONTINUED:

72.
78

VIRGINIA
There is no such obligation! No
such obligation exists.

LEONARD
Virginia, you have an obligation
to your own sanity.

VIRGINIA
And what is your role, Leonard?
My husband? Or my prison guard?

LEONARD is shocked by her fierceness. He tries to soften

his tone,

but VIRGINIA flares up as soon as he speaks.

LEONARD
Virginia...

VIRGINIA
I have endured this custody. I
have endured this imprisonment. I
am attended by doctors.
Everywhere I am attended by
doctors who inform me of my own
interests.

LEONARD
They know your interests.

VIRGINIA
They do not! They do not speak
for my interests! How dare they
presume? Let us imagine a life in
which women are the doctors, and
the men sit alone all day in
shuttered rooms in the suburbs.
Let us imagine that!

LEONARD shifts, but is still determined not to back down.
Behind him the odd PASSENGER is beginning to arrive to
wait for London train.

LEONARD
Virginia, it is hard... I can see
it must be hard for a woman... for
a woman of your...

VIRGINIA
Of what? A woman of my what
exactly?

LEONARD

A woman of your gifts...

(CONTINUED)
78

CONTINUED:

73.

(2) 78
VIRGINIA
Oh I see...
: LEONARD
... of your... of your talents...

to accept that she is not always
the best judge of her own
condition.

VIRGINIA
No? Who, then, is a better judge?
Bring this judge to Platform One.
Let me meet them.

VIRGINIA is looking at him defiantly.

LEONARD
You have a history...

VIRGINIA
Oh yes...

LEONARD

You came to Richmond with a
history of confinement. Fits.
Blackouts. Moods. Hearing
voices. We brought you here to
escape the irrevocable damage you
intended to yourself. Twice you
have tried to take your life by
your own hand.

VIRGINIA is watching him closely now, attending every
word, still not giving way.

LEONARD
I live daily with that threat.

VIRGINIA looks at him, refusing to answer.

LEONARD
I set up the press, we set up the
printing press...

VIRGINIA
Yes...

LEONARD
Not for itself. Not purely as a
thing in itself. But that you
might find a ready occupation, a
ready source of absorption and of
remedy.

(CONTINUED)
74.

78 CONTINUED: (3) 78

VIRGINIA
Like needlework?

VIRGINIA has suddenly shouted. LEONARD for a moment
loses his temper.

LEONARD
It was done for you! It was done
for your betterment! It was done
out of love. If I did not know
you better I would call this

ingratitude.

VIRGINIA
I am ungrateful? You call me
ungrateful?

VIRGINIA looks at him, accusing, shaking.

VIRGINIA
My life has been stolen from me.
I am living in a town I have no
wish to live in. I am living a
life I have no wish to live. And
I am asking how this has occurred.

VIRGINIA nods, sure of her point. There are now several
PASSENGERS on the long London platform, but VIRGINIA and
LEONARD ignore them completely.

VIRGINIA
It is time for us to move back to
London. I miss London. I miss
London life.

LEONARD
This is not you speaking,
Virginia. This is an aspect of
your illness.

VIRGINIA
It is me. It is my voice. It is
mine and mine alone.

LEONARD
It is not your voice. It is only
a voice you hear.

VIRGINIA
It is not! It is mine! I am
dying in this town!

(CONTINUED)
75.

78 CONTINUED: (4) 78

VIRGINIA is inflamed, passionate, almost mad. LEONARD
looks at her, trying to keep calm.

LEONARD
If you were clear... if you were
thinking clearly, you would
remember: it was London which
brought you low.

VIRGINIA

If I were thinking clearly?
LEONARD

We brought you to Richmond to give

you peace.
VIRGINIA takes a moment to summon all her lucidity.

VIRGINIA

If I were thinking clearly? If I
were thinking clearly, Leonard, I
would tell you that I wrestle
alone in the dark, and that only I
can know, only I can understand my
own condition. You live with the
threat, you tell me. You live
with the threat of my extinction.

There is silence. She is trembling, white.

VIRGINIA
Leonard, I live with it too.

Now it is LEONARD who cannot answer.

VIRGINIA
This is my right. This is the
right of every human being. I
choose not the suffocating
anesthetic of the suburbs, but the
violent jolt of the capital. That
is my choice. The meanest
patient, yes even the very lowest,
is allowed some say in the matter
of her own prescription. Thereby
she defines her humanity.

VIRGINIA is calm now, certain.
(CONTINUED)
78

719

76.

CONTINUED: (5) 78

VIRGINIA
I wish for your sake, Leonard,
that I could be happy in this
quietness. But if it is a choice
between Richmond and death, I
choose death.

There are now tears in LEONARD'S eyes.

LEONARD
Very well. London, then. We
shall go back to London.

LEONARD bows his head, overwhelmed by the defeat of his
strategy. There is a silence. VIRGINIA watches, full of
feeling for him. Then, at the opposite platform the
train from London arrives. From its doors, phalanxes of
COMMUTERS in dark coats and hats get down onto the
platform and head for the exit. LEONARD looks up, wiping
away his tears.

LEONARD
You must be hungry. I ama little
hungry myself.

VIRGINIA smiles. They look at each other, the issue at
last resolved between them.

VIRGINIA
Come along.

VIRGINIA and LEONARD get up and walk together along the
deserted platform, both shaken by the encounter. After a
moment, VIRGINIA takes his arm. They walk a while, arm
in arm, merging into the crowd of COMMUTERS. Then
VIRGINIA speaks, almost as an afterthought.

VIRGINIA
You do not find peace by avoiding
life, Leonard.

EXT./INT. MRS. LATCH'S HOUSE (LOS ANGELES) - EVENING 79
(1951)

LAURA'S car draws up outside MRS. LATCH'S house. RICHIE
has plainly heard her arrive, for when she looks to the
window, RICHIE is already banging his hands against it
and screaming:

RICHIE
Mommy! Mommy!

(CONTINUED)
77.

719 CONTINUED: 79

LAURA looks, fearful. Then she gets out of the car.
Along the neat suburban street, sprinklers play across
lawns, catching the evening light like fountains. RICHIE
comes running from the house towards his mother with a
triumphant cry of...

RICHIE
It's Mommy!

MRS. LATCH follows.

MRS. LATCH
Why, hello, Laura.

LAURA
Oh, Mrs. Latch. I'm sorry I'm
late.

LAURA picks RICHIE up and he buries his face in her
shoulder.

LAURA
Oh, now. Hey. Hey. Hey there,
bug. What's wrong? What's wrong?

MRS. LATCH smiles reassuringly.

MRS. LATCH
He's fine. He's been fine. He's
just pleased to see you.

LAURA
Come on, it wasn't that bad. It
wasn't that bad, was it?

RICHIE has buried himself in LAURA. MRS. LATCH nods at
LAURA'S hair.

MRS. LATCH
You got it cut, then?

LAURA
Oh, yes. Yes. No problem.

MRS. LATCH
It looks great.

LAURA
Thank you. They didn't have to do
very much.
LAURA smiles, embarrassed at the lie.

LAURA
Thank you. Very much.

EXT./INT. CAR - EVENING 80

The two of them are driving side by side. LAURA has her
eyes on the road. RICHIE is staring straight ahead, not
looking at her. The car is moving noiselessly along
suburban avenues. There is a long silence. They seem
more like two adults than mother and child.

LAURA
So that wasn't too bad, was it? I
wasn't gone long?

RICHIE
No, you weren't long.

LAURA
That's right. At one point... I
don't know... there was a moment

when I thought I might be longer.
But I changed my mind.

RICHIE says nothing.

LAURA
Honey, what is it?

RICHIE
Mommy, I love you.

There is a moment's pause.

LAURA
I love you too, baby.

There is a thoughtful look on RICHIE'S face.

LAURA
What's wrong?

RICHIE looks at LAURA as if he knows where she has been.

LAURA
What?

But still RICHIE says nothing, just goes on looking.

wonderful party. We've made Daddy
such a nice cake.

RICHIE is still looking at her, watchful.

LAURA
I love you, sweetheart. You're my
guy.

RICHIE is seen from LAURA'S POINT OF VIEW, his little
face flushed for a moment with pleasure. The SOUND
FADES, and there is a SLOW DISSOLVE THROUGH TO:

INT. RICHARD'S APARTMENT - EVENING (2001) 81

RICHARD'S face seen from the exact SAME POINT OF VIEW.
The child has become the man. RICHARD is sitting in the
near dark, a gleam of light catching the sweat on his
forehead. He has not moved from his chair, nor has he
dressed. He sits thinking back to the scene in the car.
LAURA'S voice is heard in RICHARD'S head.

LAURA (V.O.)
I love you, sweetheart. You're my
guy.

EXT./INT. TRIANGLE BUILDING - EVENING 82
CLARISSA gets out of a hired car in the afternoon light,
and heads into the doorway of the triangle building. She
gets quickly into the elevator. The elevator ascends.

INT. RICHARD'S APARTMENT - EVENING 83
Beside RICHARD, a photograph of his mother, LAURA, on her
wedding day, eyes down. RICHARD looks at it, the extreme
sweat of illness running down his face.

INT. RICHARD'S APARTMENT - EVENING 84
CLARISSA, in a repeat of the morning's progress, comes to
the door of RICHARD'S apartment and rings the bell to

warn him of her presence.

(CONTINUED)
84

80.

CONTINUED: 84

CLARISSA
Richard, Richard, it's me. I'm
early. I know.

She puts her key in the lock and opens the door. The
blinds have been pulled up and the curtains parted for
the first time. In full light at last, it looks like the
apartment of a madman -- piles of cardboard boxes, a
filthy bathtub, books flung everywhere. CLARISSA moves
forward in astonishment.

CLARISSA
Richard! What the hell's going
on?

RICHARD
What are you doing here? You're
early.

RICHARD is pushing furniture to the side. He looks like
an exalted scarecrow, his hair plastered to his skull.
He's high as a kite, and still dressed in his bathrobe
and pajamas. Immediately behind him, he has opened the
window wide. CLARISSA looks in horror.

CLARISSA
Richard, what are you doing?
What's going on?

RICHARD looks at her from across the room, his eyes
gleaming.

RICHARD
Clarissa, I had this wonderful
idea. I needed some light. I
needed to let in some light.

RICHARD moves toward the window.

CLARISSA
Richard, what are you doing?

RICHARD
I had this fantastic notion. I
took the Xanax and the Ritalin
together. It had never occurred
to me.

CLARISSA
Richard!

RICHARD screams at her.

RICHARD
Don't come near me!

CLARISSA stops. RICHARD scrambles painfully to the
windowsill and lifts one leg over the sill, so that he is
perched, bony, weightless, with the other foot still on
the apartment floor. CLARISSA stands, trying to be caln.

RICHARD
It seemed to me I needed to let in
some light. What do you think? I
cleared away all the windows.

CLARISSA
All right, do me one favor,
Richard, do me one simple favor...

RICHARD
I don't think I can make it to the
party, Clarissa. I'm sorry.

CLARISSA
You don't have to go to the party.
You don't have to go to the
ceremony.

RICHARD'S face darkens. CLARISSA shouts in desperation.

CLARISSA
You don't have to do anything,
Richard! You can do what you
like!

RICHARD
But I have to face the hours,
don't I? The hours after the
party. And the hours after that.

CLARISSA
You have good days still, Richard.
You know you do.

RICHARD
Not really. It's kind of you to
say so, but it isn't true.

CLARISSA is stopped dead, full of fear at her next
question.

CLARISSA
Are they here, Richard?

(CONTINUED)
82.

84 CONTINUED: (3) 84

RICHARD
Who?

CLARISSA
The voices?

RICHARD
Oh, the voices are always here.

CLARISSA
But is it the voices you're
hearing now?

RICHARD
No, Mrs. Dalloway. It's you.

CLARISSA looks at him, terrified now.

RICHARD
I've stayed alive for you.

RICHARD looks at her pleadingly.

RICHARD
But now you have to let me go.

CLARISSA looks at him, shocked by what he has said. But
again as she moves toward him, he cuts her off.

CLARISSA
Richard...

RICHARD
Tell me a story, all right?

CLARISSA
What about?

RICHARD

Tell me a story from your day.

CLARISSA stops, fearing this is their last moment
together.

CLARISSA
I got up...

RICHARD
Yes?

CLARISSA
And... I went out to get flowers

the book, do you know?

RICHARD
Yes.
CLARISSA

RICHARD
Was it?
CLARISSA
Yes. It was beautiful. It was so
fresh.

CLARISSA shakes her head.

RICHARD
Fresh, was it?
CLARISSA
Yes.
RICHARD
Like a morning on the beach?
CLARISSA
Yes.
RICHARD
Like that?
CLARISSA
Yes.
RICHARD
Fresh like when you and I were
young?

There is a silence. CLARISSA doesn't answer.

RICHARD
Like the morning you walked out of
that old house and you were
eighteen, and maybe I was
nineteen.

CLARISSA
Yes.

84 CONTINUED: (5) 84

RICHARD
I was nineteen years old and I'd
never seen anything so beautiful.
You, coming out of a glass door in
the early morning, still sleepy.
Isn't it strange?

CLARISSA
Yes. Yes it's strange.

RICHARD
The most ordinary morning in
anybody's life.

RICHARD shakes his head slightly.

RICHARD
Clarissa, I'm afraid I can't make
the party.

CLARISSA

The party doesn't matter. Give me
your hand.

CLARISSA reaches out to him.

RICHARD
You've been so good to me, Mrs.
Dalloway.

CLARISSA
Richard...

RICHARD

I love you.
CLARISSA stops, taken aback as he says it.

RICHARD
I don't think two people could
have been happier than we've been.

There is a moment's silence. Then RICHARD inches
forward, slides gently off the sill, and falls. CLARISSA
screams.

CLARISSA
No!

away from the window, just staring, making no noise. She
takes one step back and then another.

EXT. HUDSON STREET - EVENING 87

RICHARD'S body lands against the concrete, SMASHING a
BEER BOTTLE as it does. The corpse bounces, then
settles, face down, his robe up over his face. Silence
again.

INT. BROWNS' HOUSE - NIGHT (1951) 88

The cake, now bright with lit candles on the dining room
table. A great effort has been made for DAN'S birthday
and the front room is bright with light and decoration.
DAN blows out his-candles in one long go. RICHIE and
LAURA watch from their seats at the table.

RICHIE AND LAURA
Happy Birthday! Happy Birthday,
Dan!

They all laugh.

DAN
This is perfect. This is just
perfect.

LAURA
Do you think so? Do you really
think so?

DAN

Why sure. You must have been
working all day.

LAURA
Well we were. Weren't we, bug?
That's what we were doing.
Working all day.

DAN
This is just fantastic. It's what
I've always wanted.

LAURA is doing well as the good wife, sharing her
husband's delight in the cake. RICHIE is watching, with
a serious expression.

One day I'll tell you, Richie.
I'll tell you how it all
happened...

LAURA
Don't.

LAURA seems embarrassed. DAN looks up at her, quiet but
serious.

DAN
I want to. I want to tell him the
story.

LAURA is silent, giving permission, but ill at ease. DAN
looks at RICHIE, full of pleasure at picking his way
exactly through his story.

DAN
What happened: When I was at war
-~ at war I found myself thinking
-- and I remembered that there was
this girl that I'd seen -- I'd
never met her -- at high school --
this strange, fragile-looking girl
called Laura McGrath. Yeah. And
she was shy. And she was
interesting. And -- your mother
won't mind me telling you this,
Richie -- she was the kind of girl
you see sitting mostly on her own.

RICHIE is listening intently. The three of them are
intent 'round the table.

DAN
Yes. Richie, I'll tell you:
Sometimes when I was in the South
Pacific, the fact is, I used to
think of this girl...

LAURA
Dan...

DAN
I thought of bringing her to a
house -- a life -- well, pretty
like this.

going.

There is silence. DAN is looking at LAURA.

DAN
I had an idea of our happiness.

RICHIE watches, aware of the awful sadness between them.

LAURA
Did you make a wish?

DAN has taken one of the yellow roses from the cake, and,
unaware, has been rolling it between his fingers, back
and forth, back and forth. He is alone with his thoughts
for a few moments, then he turns and looks blankly at
LAURA. Then he nods.

DAN
Yes, I did.

INT. MORGUE - NIGHT 89

CLARISSA is seen through the glass panel in a door
waiting at the morgue. She is standing in distress,
shaken by the events of the afternoon. Then SALLY
arrives at the door, led into the morgue by an ORDERLY.
She stops a moment to look through the door. Now, full
of feeling, she opens the door to join CLARISSA.
CLARISSA looks across.

INT. HOGARTH HOUSE - NIGHT 90

In the drawing room, there are two pools of light from
standard lamps. On opposite sides of the room LEONARD
and VIRGINIA are sitting, a kind of truce between them
after the events of the afternoon. They are both
reading. VIRGINIA'S book is in her hand. She still has
the London rail ticket, which she is using as a bookmark.
She fingers the ticket, turning it over. After a few
moments LEONARD looks up, as if something has occurred to
him from a previous conversation.

LEONARD
Why does someone have to die?

VIRGINIA looks up and frowns.

VIRGINIA

Leonard?
LEONARD

In your book?
VIRGINIA

Oh.

You said someone has to die. Why?

LEONARD catches just a trace of VIRGINIA'S reaction.

LEONARD

Is that a stupid question?
VIRGINIA

No.
LEONARD

I imagine my question is stupid.
VIRGINIA

Not at all.
LEONARD

Well?

VIRGINIA gives it thought before answering.
VIRGINIA
Someone has to die in order that

the rest of us should value life
more.

LEONARD looks at her, the two of them serious now.

VIRGINIA
It's contrast.

LEONARD
And who will die?

VIRGINIA
It's a secret.

LEONARD
Tell me.

VIRGINIA pauses, then gives him the gift of an answer.

VIRGINIA
The poet will die. The visionary.

RICHIE, the poet, the visionary, lying in the bed ina
little room painted with stars. It is decorated with

pictures of rockets and imaginary astronauts. His face
is alert on the pillow.

EXT. BROWNS' HOUSE - NIGHT

The Browns' house seen from the road. It's dark. Just
one pool of light is thrown onto their drive by a side-
window. The street at peace.

INT. BROWNS' HOUSE - RICHIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

RICHIE is lying awake listening to the sound of his
father in the next room calling to LAURA.

INT. BROWNS' HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT

LAURA is sitting, her head in her hands, on the closed
toilet seat. She is in white pajamas, bent down in an
attitude of abject despair, umable to move. After a few
moments, DAN calls through from the bedroom.

DAN (0.S8.)
What are you doing?

LAURA looks up. She has taken her make-up off and it is
plain she has been crying.

LAURA
I'm brushing my teeth.

DAN (0.S.)
Are you coming to bed?

LAURA
Yes. In a minute.

DAN (0.S.)
Come to bed, Laura Brown.

But LAURA doesn't move, just turns away, trapped.
DAN (0.S.)
I ran into Ray, he says Kitty's
had to go to the hospital.

LAURA
That's right.

I'm terrified.

y?

LAURA speaks quietly, not loud enough for DAN to hear.

LAURA
Oh, the idea she could disappear.

DAN has not heard anything.
DAN (0.S.)

Perhaps you could go see her in
the morning, honey.

LAURA
I was going to. I was going to
stop by.
Co There is another short silence. LAURA is unable to move.
DAN (0.S.)

I've had a wonderful day and I
have you to thank.

LAURA looks away, in despair now.

DAN (0.S.)
Come to bed, honey.

LAURA
I'm coming.

But still LAURA stands, not moving. After a while, DAN
speaks again.

DAN (0.S.)
So. Are you coming?

LAURA
Yes.

In the distance, you can hear a DOG BARKING. LAURA gets
up and reaches for the pull-light over the mirror. The
ane bathroom goes dark. She takes the steps which bring her
co to the door which leads to the door which leads to the
bedroom. LAURA stands in the door, the only light
falling on her face.

INT. HOGARTH HOUSE - STUDY - DAY (1923) 95

VIRGINIA is now sitting in her favorite chair with a
writing board across her lap, notebook in hand. The
light pools around her. She is not writing, just
thinking. LEONARD appears in the doorway opposite. He
says nothing.

VIRGINIA
What? What?

LEONARD smiles.

LEONARD
I was hoping you were going to
bed.

VIRGINIA
I am. I am going to bed.

They look at each other, their eyes full of love and
humor.

LEONARD
What then?

VIRGINIA
All else is clear. The outline of
the story is planned. Now one
thing only.

VIRGINIA shakes her head very slightly, still in the
chair.

VIRGINIA
Mrs. Dalloway's destiny must be
resolved.

INT. CLARISSA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT (2001) 96

CLARISSA is in the kitchen with SALLY and JULIA. Every
surface is taken up with food for the party which never
happened. CLARISSA has the crab dish in her hand and is
emptying it sadly into the bin. She is still in the coat
she was wearing all afternoon. As she dumps the wasted
food, she hears a RING at the DOOR.

CLARISSA goes to the apartment door and opens it. LAURA
BROWN is standing directly opposite. She is now in her
early 80s, slightly stooped with steel-gray hair and
parchment skin. She is wearing a dark, floral dress and
coat. CLARISSA is taken aback for a moment.

96 CONTINUED: 96

CLARISSA
You're Laura Brown.

LAURA
Yes. I'm Richard's mother.

CLARISSA
Of course.

CLARISSA reaches out her hand.

CLARISSA
I'm Clarissa Vaughan. Come in.

LAURA has a small bag which CLARISSA now lifts for her as
she leads her into the apartment. At the end of the
corridor SALLY is standing with JULIA behind her, but
CLARISSA signals tactfully for them to hold off a moment,
as she leads LAURA into the sitting room. Throughout the
apartment, dinner tables have been set with white table
cloths, and glasses. CLARISSA is alone with LAURA in the
sitting room.

CLARISSA
My friend Sally's in the kitchen.
And my daughter.

LAURA just looks at her a moment, not answering.

CLARISSA
We were having a party. We were
going to have a party.

LAURA
I was lucky. I got the last plane
from Toronto.

In the kitchen, unheard, unseen, JULIA watches, then
speaks quietly to SALLY.

JULIA
So that's the monster.

LAURA has approached a table loaded with RICHARD'S books.

CLARISSA
I hope I did the right thing. I
found your number in his phone
book.

LAURA
Yes. He had it. But we didn't
speak often.

(CONTINUED)

96 CONTINUED: (2) 96

LAURA is looking at RICHARD'S picture. CLARISSA stands a
moment, waiting.

LAURA
It's a terrible thing, Miss
Vaughan, to outlive your whole
family.

CLARISSA
Richard's father died...

LAURA
Yes. He died of cancer. Quite
young. And Richard's sister is
dead.

LAURA looks at her a moment.

LAURA
Obviously you feel unworthy. It
gives you feelings of
unworthiness. You survive and
they don't.

CLARISSA waits a second before speaking.

CLARISSA
Did you read the poems?

LAURA
Yes. I read them. I also read
the novel. You see, people say
that the novel is difficult...

CLARISSA
I know...

LAURA
They say that.

CLARISSA
I know...

LAURA

He had me die in the novel. I
know why he did that. It hurt, of
course. I can't pretend it didn't
hurt, but I know why he did it.

CLARISSA
You left Richie when he was a
child?

LAURA
I left both my children. I
abandoned them. They say it's the
worst thing a mother can do.

Neither of them move. The room is silent now.

LAURA
You have a daughter?
CLARISSA
Yes. But I never met Julia's
father.
LAURA
You so wanted a child?
CLARISSA
That's right.
LAURA

You're a very lucky woman.

CLARISSA looks down.

There's a

LAURA
There are times when you don't
belong and you think you're going
to kill yourself. Once I went to
a hotel. That night... later that
night, I made a plan. Plan was, I
would leave my family when my
second child was born. And that's
what I did. Got up one morning,
made breakfast, went to the bus
stop, got on a bus. I'd left a
note.

moment's silence.

LAURA
I got a job in a library in
Canada. It would be wonderful to
say you regretted it. It would be
easy. But what does it mean?
What does it mean to regret when
you have no choice? It's what you
can bear. There it is. No one is
going to forgive me.

LAURA looks at CLARISSA, steady, unapologetic.

LAURA
It was death. I chose life.

INT. CLARISSA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 97

CLARISSA comes out of the sitting room down the hall of
the apartment and quietly goes into their bedroom, still
wearing her dark coat. SALLY is in the kitchen with
JULIA and now look up at the sight of CLARISSA. She gets
up and follows CLARISSA into the bedroom.

INT. CLARISSA'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT 98

SALLY comes into the room to find CLARISSA sitting on the
side of the bed in her coat. The two women look at each
other.

SALLY
You need to take your coat off.

SALLY comes round and gestures to CLARISSA to stand up.
SALLY puts her hands on CLARISSA'S shoulders to help her
take off the coat. As she does, CLARISSA turns and looks
at SALLY, the two of them overcome. The two women look
warmly at each other, then they kiss.

INT. APARTMENT - JULIA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 99

LAURA is unpacking her suitcase on the bed in Julia's
room. It has only a few things which she has hurriedly
put in for the trip. She looks frail and alone. There
is a KNOCK on the door and JULIA comes in with a cup and
saucer.

JULIA
I thought you might like a cup of
tea.

LAURA

That's very kind, dear. I feel
I'm stealing your room.

JULIA has put the tea down beside the bed.

JULIA
We put the food away, so... if
you're hungry in the night, just
help yourself.

LAURA
Well, I will. You have somewhere?

JULIA
Yes. The sofa.

Instinctively JULIA moves towards her and puts her arms
round her. The 18-year-old and the 80-year-old embrace.
LAURA stands a moment, astonished at her warmth. Then
JULIA moves away.

LAURA
Good night, sweetheart.

JULIA
Good night.

INT. HOGARTH HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT (1923) 100

VIRGINIA lies in bed, making no effort to sleep, but
lying by moonlight in her bed, her eyes open, white like
a ghost.

INT. CLARISSA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT (2001) 101

The corridor of the apartment. Everyone else has gone to
bed. CLARISSA, in her white pajamas, is in the kitchen
turning off the lights one by one. As she turns off the
last one in the kitchen, she comes into the corridor, and
begins the same process. She looks round briefly at her
own home: comfortable, solid, complete. At last she
seems at peace. As she turns out the lights in the
corridor, the voice of VIRGINIA WOOLF is heard.

VIRGINIA (V.O.)
Dear Leonard, to look life in the
face, always to look life in the
face, and to know what it is, to
love it for what it is. At last
to know it. To love it for what
it is. And then to put it away.

CLARISSA turns out the last light and the corridor is
darkened. She turns and goes into her room.
EXT. RIVER OUSE - DAY (1941) 102
VIRGINIA WOOLF walks calmly once more into the river.
VIRGINIA (V.0O.)

Leonard, always the years between

us, always the years, always the

love. Always the hours.

about to plunge herself under. The sun plays on the
water.
