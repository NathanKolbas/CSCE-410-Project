FADE IN:

OPENING SEQUENCE (MUSICAL SCORE OVER)

 

Images of an upscale suburban community.
Boats on the water.

A quiet street. A picket gate.

EXT. BACK YARD OF A BEAUTIFUL HOME - LARCHMONT, NY — MORNING

 

It's a gorgeous spring day, and we move in on an impeccably
laid out garden. Straight rows of flowers in full bloom,
manicured bushes, and a trellis with climbing vines.

BECCA CORBETT, attractive, 30's, walks into frame dragging a
heavy bag of potting soil. She pulls the soil bag over to a
section of the garden where she had been digging, and cuts
the bag open.

Becca dumps the soil onto the ground where she is planting
flowers. Behind her, we see part of her fine house and
across the street, a shimmering stretch of water.

Becca is on her knees now mixing potting soil with earth.
She starts to plant a straight line of young plants as a
border to her flower-bed.

She picks up the hose from beside the free-standing garage.
Near her we notice an empty doghouse

A little later, Becca stands with a hose, watering the
garden. She admires her day's work.

END OF OPENING SEQUENCE

WOMAN'S VOICE (0.C.)
Becca?

Becca turns to see her neighbor PEG, middle-aged, peeking
from behind the gate leading to the next property. She comes
into the garden. Becca is a little uncomfortable, but always
polite.

BECCA
Oh...Hey Peg.

PEG
It looks so nice back here.
BECCA
Well, I’m just, you know, trying to
get things back into shape.

PEG
Listen, I don’t know if you and
Howie are free tonight, but we’re
having a few people over for
dinner.

BECCA
Oh, that’s very sweet of you.

PEG
I know it’s really short notice.

BECCA
Actually, we have plans.

PEG
(beat)
Oh. Oh, well.

BECCA
But, uh, another time though. I
haven't talked to Pete in ages.

PEG
Well you haven’t missed much. He’s
still the same S.0.B. he always
was.

Peg chuckles. Becca looks down to see that Peg has stepped
on a plant recently put in the ground.

PEG
Oh God. I’m so sorry.
(steps off the plant)

BECCA
It’s okay.

PEG
I am so sorry.

BECCA
No, it’s fine.

PEG
These stupid feet.
BECCA
Well, have a great dinner, Peg.

This is her gentle cue to leave, and Peg gets the hint. She
backs out of the yard politely.

PEG
We'll do it next time.

BECCA
Absolutely.

But they both know this is probably a lie.

PEG
Say hi to Howie for me.

BECCA
I sure will.

Becca closes the gate after Peg.

As soon as she's gone, Becca moves over to tend to the
crushed plant. She assesses the damage, and sighs, peeved.

INT. BECCA'S KITCHEN —- EARLY EVENING

Becca stands at her sink, rinsing vegetables in a colander.
Across the way, she can see right into her neighbor's living
room, where Peg, PETE and their guests are chatting.

Peg’s in the midst of a very animated story that has everyone
laughing hysterically. Becca watches for a moment, then
turns off the water in the sink, dries her hands, and turns
the blinds so no one can see inside.

Howie, home from work, comes in and grabs a beer.

HOWIE
Mmmm. Smells good in there.

BECCA
If Peg asks, we went out tonight.

HOWIE
Where'd we go?

BECCA
We saw the Stoppard play.

HOWIE
Really?
BECCA
Uh-huh.

HOWIE
Did we enjoy it?

BECCA
Very much.

Becca is at the stove now melting some butter in a pan.

BECCA
She asked us to dinner again.

HOWIE
She's just being nice.

BECCA
You're more than welcome to go over
there.

HOWIE

And abandon your risotto?
(wraps arms around her)

BECCA
Careful, Howie. The pan’s hot.

She pushes him off gently, and continues stirring the pot.
She’s all business tonight.

Howie watches for a moment, then takes a bite of some of the
food being cooked.

BECCA
(gently scolding)
Hey...
HOWIE
Hey...
(heads out)

I’m gonna hop in the shower.

BECCA
Uh-huh. About twenty minutes.

INT. BECCA'S LIVING ROOM —- NIGHT

A beautiful room. Becca sits on the couch reading. It's
late. The house is quiet. We hear only a ticking clock.
Then the phone rings, startling Becca. She doesn't move to
get it. She just stares at it, afraid to answer it.

Finally she reaches over, and picks it up...

BECCA
Hello?

Becca listens. The news is not good. She’s confused.

BECCA
What time is it?

INT. BECCA'S FOYER - MOMENTS LATER

Becca is pulling on her jacket when Howie comes downstairs,
sleepy, in gym shorts and a t-shirt.

HOWIE
What’s going on?

EXT. YONKERS POLICE DEPARTMENT - CENTRAL BOOKING - NIGHT

Becca and her sister IZZY, early 30's, are walking down the
steps and back to the car. Becca is pissed.

BECCA
You have nothing to say?

IZZY
(beat - confused)
Thank you?

This is not what Becca meant.

BECCA
You were in a bar-fight.

IZZY
It wasn't a bar-fight.

BECCA
You were in a bar. Fighting.

IZZY
It wasn’t a fight. Some drunk girl
was screaming in my face, so I hit
her and that was the end of it.

BECCA
Well who was she?
IZZY
I don’t know.

BECCA
People don’t scream at you for no
reason.

IZZY
Sure they do, you should get out
more.

BECCA

God Izzy, it’s so...Jerry Springer.

IZZY
What’s that supposed to mean? You
think I’m trashy?

BECCA
You can’t keep doing this. You’re
not a kid anymore.

IZZY
I didn’t know there was a cutoff
date.

BECCA

Well there is. For acting like a
jackass, there’s a cutoff date...

Becca unlocks her car as they approach - BLOOP-BLOOP.

BECCA
I wanna stop worrying about you.

IZZY
Hey, don't worry about me. She was
the one on the floor.
Becca and Izzy in the car.
IZZY
Can I stay with you tonight?
EXT. BECCA'S HOME - EARLY DAWN

One light turns on in a downstairs room.
UPSTAIRS HALLWAY — A MOMENT LATER

Becca sneaks out of her bedroom. She hears voices, and the
distinct sound of a little boy laughing. She takes a
moment, then steels herself and heads downstairs silently.

LIVING ROOM — CONTINUOUS

Becca finds Howie, seated with the lights off, watching a
video of Danny on his phone. He doesn’t notice her presence.

HOWIE (on video)
Now, Danny, I wanna tell you a
secret, ‘kay? When you go back
down, give Mom a big kiss, okay?
Ready?... One, two, three. ...Oh,
that was high! Whoo!

Howie smiles as he watches the video. He is smiling.

HOWIE (on video)
Danny, look at me when you come
back.

BECCA (on video)
He’s getting used to it.

HOWIE (on video)
Do you want any cake?

DANNY (on video)
Yeah!

HOWIE (on video)
Oh, do we have cake today?

BECCA (on video)
Yeah, we do.

DANNY (on video)
Yeah.

HOWIE (on video)
Oh, my gosh. And you really want
some?

This is too hard for Becca. She backs away as the video
continues, and sneaks back up the stairs, unnoticed.
A_ BLANK WHITE PAGE

A hand reaches into frame and draws a straight line in black
ink. The hand draws a parallel black line and then connects
the two with an oddly shaped circular end.

We pull back to reveal the hand is drawing a network of
intersecting tubes and portal openings. The artist shades in
a section.

INT. BECCA'S KITCHEN - THE NEXT DAY — MORNING

Becca is putting some finishing touches on a creme brulee
that she has just prepared in her kitchen. Her eyes narrow
in concentration as she carefully cauterizes the top of it
into a brown hard shell.

Izzy stands nearby in her bathrobe, waiting expectantly.
Howie enters the kitchen with his gym bag.

HOWIE
Well, if it isn’t Ma Barker.

IZZY
I’m sure that would be very funny
if I knew who that was.

HOWIE
Rick and I are gonna play squash.
(kisses Becca goodbye)
I have my cell if you need me.

IZZY
Squash. You go play squash, Howie.

HOWIE
You don’t even know what squash is.

IZZY
I don’t care what squash is

Izzy's cell phone rings. She checks the called I.D., and
smiles while answering the phone.

IZZY
(into phone)
Hello?
(heads out of the room)
Yeah! Yeah.
(laughs)
I thought she was gonna kill me!
INT. SUN-ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Izzy paces around the room while chatting on her phone.

IZZY
(into the phone)
Yeah, I know. I think Auggie must
have told her.

Izzy sees Becca enter the room holding up the créme brulee.

IZZY
(into the phone)
Hey, I gotta go.

Izzy hang up the phone and excitedly takes the creme brulee
from Becca.

IZZY
Mmm. Thank you Becca.

Izzy takes a seat by the window, and starts tapping the
caramel with the spoon.

IZZY
Oo, I like the way it cracks.

BECCA
Of course you do.

Becca watches her eat for a couple moments. Then...

BECCA
So you did know that woman.

IZZY
(throws her head back)
Oh my god! Why are you listening
to my phone conversations?

BECCA
Are you sleeping with that girl's
boyfriend.

Izzy eats, really wanting to change the subject.

IZZY
It’s been over between them.
They’re just living together
because of the rent.

BECCA
Then why did she accost you?
10.

IZZY
Because she's a lunatic!
(beat)
And Auggie told her I was pregnant.

Becca lets out a disapproving chuckle. But Izzy isn’t
joking. Slowly...Becca realizes.

BECCA
You are not.

IZZY
You’re gonna love him. He's a
really great guy. He’s a musician!

BECCA
That's terrific.

IZZY
He works, Becca. He gets work as a
musician.

BECCA

How long have you known?

IZZY
A few weeks.

BECCA
Did you tell Mom?

Izzy nods sheepishly.

BECCA
Oh, come on. You told Mom before
me?

IZZY
I had to.

BECCA

Why didn’t you tell me?

IZZY
Why do you think?

This just sits there for a couple beats.
IZZY

I’m sorry, Becca. I know the timing
really sucks.
11.

BECCA
Hey, what can ya do?

Becca has been disarmed. How to proceed? Luckily, she’s a
really good liar...

BECCA
I’m just glad you finally told me.

They hug. Becca is obviously still processing it.

INT. SQUASH COURT - DAY

Howie and his best friend, RICK, athletic, 30's, are in the
midst of an intense game of squash. It's all grunts and
thwacks and squeaking sneakers. Howie loses the point.

INT. LOCKER ROOM —- MOMENTS LATER

Sweaty and spent, the men enter chatting. Their banter is
easy and mostly good-natured.

RICK
Debbie’s been driving me crazy with
these kitchen renovations. The
counter-top negotiations alone...

HOWIE
I told you not to marry an agent.

They open their lockers and get changed over the following.

HOWIE
She still hasn't called, you know.

RICK
(beat - guilt)
No, I know.

HOWIE
I don’t mean to be a pest about it,
but... I just know Becca would

love to hear from her.

RICK
I know. I tell her, Howie. I do.
But she’s still...I don’t know
freaked out, I guess.

HOWIE
It’s been eight months.
12.

RICK
I know. I'll talk to her.

HOWIE
Thank you.
(changing)
Hey, how are the kids?

RICK
They’re good. Emily's doing
ballet. Robby is in tee-ball.

HOWIE
Wow. Tee-ball.

Howie tries to look interested, but Rick sees through it.

RICK
(tries to sound off-hand)
Have you guys talked at all about
having another?

HOWIE
(beat)
No.
(beat)
It's a little soon.

Rick nods. They go back to changing.
INT. MEETING HALL - COMMUNITY CENTER - NIGHT

Becca and Howie talk quietly as they walk into the meeting
room.

HOWIE
Just be open-minded. That’s all
I’m asking.

BECCA
I’m here, aren’t I?

Couples mill about drinking coffee, waiting for the meeting
to begin. Becca and Howie steel themselves as another couple
approaches. GABBY is attractive. KEVIN seems tired. They
both make Becca uncomfortable.

HOWIE
Hey.
13.

GABBY
How's it going?

HOWIE
Good.

BECCA
Yeah, good. Hanging in there.

Howie looks to Becca, who looks a little ill at ease.

GABBY
You sure?

HOWIE
Yeah. Yeah, um, we just...found
out that Becca’s sister is
pregnant. So.

BECCA
(a warning)
Howie.
HOWIE
What?
GABBY

That can be hard, I remember when
my cousin got pregnant--

BECCA
Yeah, it's not really a big deal.

Becca wants to end this conversation. She’s miffed Howie
even brought it up.

GABBY
Okay. If you wanna talk about it
though, you know the group’s right
here.

BECCA
(chuckles )
Yeah, I don't think so. "Hey
everybody, fresh meat."

HOWIE
Becca, be nice.
14.

GABBY
(to Kevin)
Doesn't she remind of you of Lydia?
(back to Howie and Becca)
There was this woman in the group a
couple years ago--

KEVIN
It was four. Four years ago.

GABBY
Well it doesn’t really matter when
she was here, my point is that she
reminds me of Lydia. She really
wasn’t into the support group model
at first.

 

Becca is suddenly confused. Did she just mishear her?

BECCA
(confused)
How long have you been in Group?

KEVIN
It'll be eight years in June.

Becca is stunned, and can barely hide it. Eight years.

HOWIE
Oh, I didn’t... I didn’t realize
it was that long.

GABBY
Yeah, we’re the veterans. You know
for us, it’s a good way to touch
base. Everyone’s on a different
schedule...

HOWIE
Of course.

Becca is staring at Kevin. His misery is still palpable.
And this terrifies her.

INT. MEETING HALL — LATER THAT NIGHT

The meeting is in full swing. A grieving father, SAM, is
speaking to the group in a very heartfelt manner. His wife
(ANA) holds his hand throughout.
15.

SAM
She, uh, she visits me sometimes.
In dreams. And she tells me it’s
okay. And she’s with God.

He checks in with his wife. Then continues.

SAM
And we have good days. Then you
think that if you have enough good
days it might actually get better.
But then...

Several of the other parents nod with recognition. Becca,
however, actually looks annoyed. She looks to Howie and
rolls her eyes a little.

SAM
It was her anniversary last week.

ANA
A year last Tuesday.

SAM
And it just starts all over again.
We just have to remind each other
that it was just part of God’s
plan. And we can’t know why. Only
God can know why.

ANA
God had to take her. He needed
another angel.

SAM
He needed another angel.

BECCA
(beat)
Why didn’t he just make one?

Silence. They all turn to Becca, confused.

BECCA
Another angel. I mean, he’s God
after all. Why didn’t he just make
another angel?

She is met with stunned silence - a mix of confusion and
offense. Even Howie is taken aback by her outburst. Gabby
notices Kevin smirking a little.
16.

BECCA
Just putting it out there...

But no one responds. Becca leaves over to Howie and
whispers...

BECCA
I'd like to go.
(to the group)
I think we’re gonna go.
(to Howie)
Is that alright?

Howie stands, stunned. He and Becca make an awkward exit.

HOWIE
Excuse us.

INT. ITALIAN RESTAURANT - LATER THAT NIGHT
Becca and Howie look through the menus, mid-conversation.

HOWIE
They're talking, it’s their time,
and you have to respect that.

BECCA
Come on.

HOWIE
I mean, you sit there for weeks and
you don’t say a word.

BECCA
I’m sorry. I can’t stand the god-
freaks. You know that.

HOWIE
But they're not all like that.
Kevin and Gabby aren't.

BECCA
No. Kevin and Gabby are
professional wallowers. Did you
hear what they said? Eight years,
Howie. Eight. If that’s what you
want to become, then...

HOWIE
Look, if you wanna take a break--
17.

BECCA
No, not a break, I'm done.

HOWIE
I know the Izzy stuff got under
your skin--

BECCA
Please don't do that. One semester
of Psychology fifteen years ago and
suddenly you can analyze--

HOWIE
Well Jesus, Becca--

BECCA
(a little too firmly)
I just don't like the group. I
gave it a try, and it's not for me.

 

This is final. Howie knows he can’t win this argument.

HOWIE
Okay. It’s not for you.

BECCA
Thank you.
(back to the menu...then)
Do you mind if we not eat here?
Nothing's really jumping out at me.

He lets out a breath - perfect - and closes the menu.

INT. BECCA'S KITCHEN — THE NEXT DAY

Becca is alone in the kitchen. It’s the middle of the day
and the house is deadly quiet. She’s been alone with her
thoughts for awhile. She stares at the paintings on the
fridge. She takes them in - a tree, a robot, a shark
attacking a woman. They all have the distinctive scrawl of a
child, and the name Danny written across the bottom.

Becca looks closely for a moment, and then removes the
Magnets one by one, taking the paintings off the fridge,
simply and without emotion.

SAME - A LITTLE LATER

Becca cleans out the kitchen cabinets. Kids’ cereals, juice
boxes, mac & cheese, all tossed in a garbage bag.
18.

INT. DANNY'S ROOM — DAY

The room looks essentially the same as it did when Danny was
alive. Becca is at his dresser pulling clothes out of the
drawers and tossing them into a laundry basket. She doesn't
pause over the clothes or give them much consideration.
She's just doing the laundry.

INT. BECCA'S LAUNDRY ROOM - DAY

Becca loads Danny's clothes into the washing machine. The
water is running. She carefully fills a cup with soap powder
and pours it over the laundry. She stops for a moment to
watch the agitator grind away at the clothes. Then she
closes the lid.

INT. BECCA’S LAUNDRY ROOM — DAY
Becca, holding the laundry basket, is standing, staring at

the dryer. BUZZZZZZZ and the dryer cycle ends. She opens
the dryer door and starts to unload.

EXT. CITY STREET — YONKERS — DAY

Becca drives through a less nice neighborhood.

EXT. BECCA'S MOTHER'S HOUSE - YONKERS - MOMENTS LATER

 

Becca's car pulls into the driveway of a rundown house on a
rundown block. She gets out of the car, and lifts a large
garbage bag from the trunk. She seems to be energized and in
better spirits.

She walks up the driveway, and is suddenly startled by TAZ, a
big dog barking on the other side of the fence that leads out
back. Becca stiffens, her good mood gone. The dog is loud
and happy.

AUGGIE, a scruffy African American guy in his 30’s comes
across the yard with a heaping bowl of dog food.

AUGGIE
Taz! Stop! Come here and eat!
Come on!

Taz goes running to the bowl of food, and Auggie approaches
Becca at the fence. She’s confused. Who is this guy?
She’s not
She fixes

19.

AUGGIE
Sorry. He’s not really dangerous.
(to Taz)
Hey, eat.
(to Becca)

Just kinda dumb.

BECCA
No, I know. He’s my dog.

AUGGIE
Oh, you're Becca! Of course! I
should've recognized you. I’m
Auggie.

sure how to take this. What has Izzy told him?
a loose strand of her hair.

BECCA
Oh. Hi, Auggie.

AUGGIE
Hi.

Auggie and Becca shakes hands. The front door opens to reveal
NAT, Becca’s mom, plump and in her sixties.

NAT
Oh my god, why didn't you tell me
you were coming over? I would've
picked up the house.
(indicates)
That’s Auggie.

BECCA
Yeah, we met. Is Izzy here?

NAT
(her eyes narrow)
Oh yeah, she's here.
(does not approve)
She got fired from the Applebee's.

Becca follows her mother into the house.

INT. NAT'S DINING ROOM / KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

Becca, chipper again, is unpacking the piles of Danny's
clothes onto the table. Izzy sits watching, not exactly sure
what to say. She’s uneasy.
20.

BECCA
I was planning to bring it all down
to Goodwill, but now I'm glad I
didn't. Look at all these shirts,
and the sweaters.

Nat buzzes around making them coffee.

IZZY
I don't know, Bec. They're in baby
clothes for so long, it'd be awhile
before he could even fit into that
stuff.

BECCA
It comes up very quickly. You'll
see. You’re gonna be happy I saved
them.

Auggie crosses through the kitchen with bagpipes.
BECCA

(whispers)
Is he living here?

NAT
He has to. His girlfriend kicked
him out.

IZZY

Ex-girlfriend.

NAT
She knew what I meant.

Becca holds up a little shirt.

BECCA
Did you see this one?

IZZY
Cute. But what if it's a girl?

BECCA
Then I'll give them to someone
else. You're gonna thank me. A
couple years worth of clothes here.
Think of the money you'll save.

IZZY
It's not about the money.
BECCA
Well it should be. You need to
start thinking about that.
Especially if the dad's a musician.
It costs a lot to raise a child.

IZZY
(finally)
It'd be weird, Becca. If it's a
boy. To see him running around in
Danny's clothes.
(beat)
I would feel weird about it.

The air is sucked out of the room. Becca looks down at the
clothes, suddenly feeling a little stupid. Nat doesn't move.

Her eyes look from one daughter to the other.

BECCA
Yeah, I’m sorry. Of course it'd be
weird. I don't know what I was--

IZZY
It was a nice offer.

BECCA
You’re gonna get a lot of clothes
anyway - Christmas, Birthdays. You
won’t have to worry about that.

She's re-bagging the clothes. Nat tries to lighten the mood.

NAT
It's probably a girl anyway. I'ma
little psychic about these things.
Remember I said Sheila was having a
girl? And Karen? I think there's
a girl in there.

IZZY
I hope there is. That's what I
want. I mean, either way, so long
as it's healthy obviously, but I
hope it's a girl.

BECCA
Me too.

She looks to Izzy and tries to smile supportively.
22.

NAT
You want some coffee cake, honey?
I got some coffee cake in here.

BECCA
I'm gonna take off. I promised
Howie that I'd pick up some dinner.
(re: cake)
Mmm looks good though.

Becca lifts the bag, awkwardly. Nat and Izzy exchange looks.
After Becca’s gone...
NAT

(to Izzy)
Here. Eat some cake.

EXT. GOODWILL PARKING LOT - DAY

Becca gets out of her car, grabs the garbage bag of clothes
from her trunk, and makes her way to the Goodwill drop-box.

Once there, she considers what she's about to do for just a
moment, and then lifts the bag into the drop box. She turns
on her heel and heads back to the car, without looking back.

INT. BECCA'S CAR — A MOMENT LATER

Becca pulls up to a stoplight, and she takes a deep breath,
determined to hold it together.

A school bus pulls up beside her car, and Becca glances over
at it. Sitting in one of the window-seats is a teenage boy,
facing front. Becca stares at him curiously. And then the
grip on her steering wheel tightens.

The boy turns his head slightly and for just a second, Becca
gets a good look - it's JASON WILLETTE, 17.

BACK TO BECCA — CONTINUOUS

Becca leans forward, trying to get a better view of the boy.
The light changes to green and the bus takes off.

Becca, shaken, just watches it go. And then the car behind
her starts honking, and Becca is snapped back to reality.
She puts her foot on the gas.
23.

EXT. ROADS OF LARCHMONT — DAY

The school bus rolls through the manicured streets of the
town. It stops at a corner to let a couple students off.
And then the bus continues on.

When it does, Becca's car rolls into frame, keeping a safe
distance from the bus she’s trailing.

EXT. 2ND INTERSECTION  - DAY
Becca watches the bus drive through a YELLOW LIGHT. Her eyes
widen with alarm. Her foot on the accelerator. Her car

moves through the intersection just as the light is turning
RED.

EXT. TREE-LINED STREET - LARCHMONT - A LITTLE LATER

The bus has stopped, and Becca pulls up a discreet distance
behind it. This time a 14-YEAR-OLD GIRL gets off followed
by...Jason, book-bag slung over his shoulder. The Girl walks
off in one direction as the bus pulls away.

Becca watches as Jason heads in the other direction and up
the driveway of a nice house. He slips inside.

Becca sits there for awhile. Then finally pulls away.

INT. BECCA AND HOWIE’S LIVING ROOM — NIGHT

Becca and Howie have settled onto the couch after dinner.
Becca sits, lost in thought, holding an empty wine glass.

HOWIE
When did Rick ever beat me in
squash?

BECCA

Did he mention Debbie at all?

HOWIE
You can call her, you know. Get the
reports directly.

BECCA
I don’t wanna call her. She should
call me.

Howie heads into the kitchen and tosses the empty bottle into
the recycling bin.
24.

BECCA (0.S.)
I would have been there for her if
god forbid anything had ever
happened to Robby or Em.

KITCHEN - INTERCUT

Howie stops at the fridge, and notices that Danny's paintings
are gone. Not sure what to make of it, he just stands there.

BECCA (0.S.)
I wouldn’t have vanished the way
she did.

BECCA

I wouldn't.

BECCA (0.S.)
Howie?

BACK TO THE LIVING ROOM

Howie stands in the doorway, debating whether to mention the
paintings or not. He decides against it.

BECCA
You know what I mean?

Howie grabs a remote instead and clicks on the stereo. Al

Green's "Simply Beautiful" plays quietly. Becca looks up,
bemused.

HOWIE
Yeah.

He moves onto the couch to massage her shoulders.

BECCA
Howie.

HOWIE
Turn around. Come on, you need to
relax.

Howie starts to massage Becca’s back.

HOWIE
You're shoulders are all knotted
up.

BECCA

Yeah, well...
25.

HOWIE
Forget about Debbie, and whatever
else is bothering you.

Howie continues to massage her. Becca seems to warm up to
it. He kisses her neck. She giggles a little.

BECCA
Ohhh, I see what this is. Dimming
the lights.

HOWIE
What.

BECCA
You’re trying to seduce me. Plying
me with liquor.

HOWIE
It worked in college.

BECCA
That’s enough.

Becca pushes him away playfully.

BECCA

That's enough.
(gets up off the couch)

HOWIE
Where are you going?

BECCA
I'm feeling kinda antsy tonight.
I’m sorry. It was a weird day--

HOWIE
Right.
Howie clicks off the music, and lets out a grumpy sigh.

BECCA
What, now you’re gonna pout?

HOWIE
Well it's been eight months.

BECCA
(beat)
But who's keeping track?
26.

HOWIE
Iam. I'm keeping track.

BECCA
I'm just not ready yet, Howie. I'm
sorry if you think that's abnormal--

HOWIE
I don't.

BECCA
Then what's the problem?

HOWIE
We need to at least head in that
direction, which might feel strange
at first, but...

BECCA
But you wanna have sex.

HOWIE
Well don't say it like that.

BECCA
You’re trying to rope me into
having sex!

HOWIE
I am not. I wasn't roping you into
sex-—
BECCA
Al Green isn't roping?
HOWIE
No.
BECCA
Al Green?
HOWIE

I thought it was nice. That's all.
I was trying to make things nice.

BECCA
Well you can't. I'm sorry. But
things aren't "nice" anymore.

They're silent. Howie just stares at her.
27.

LIVING ROOM — LATER THAT NIGHT

Howie is seated with the lights off, watching a video of
Danny on his phone.

We see flashes of Danny on the little screen, spinning around
in what seems to be a tire swing. We hear a dog barking.

HOWIE (on video)
And, will you hold him for a
second? Just hold him, just hold
him like that.

DANNY (on video)
(laughing)
Dad, quit it!

BECCA (on video)
(laughing)
Quit it.

The video is mostly a blur, with Danny’s laughing face coming
into focus for just a second as he swings on a tire swing.

HOWIE
Yeah, pull him past you. All right,
now.

BECCA (on video)
Cause Taz wants to go on the tire.

HOWIE (on video)
Hold on. Hold on. Let me see Mom
and--

BECCA (on video)
Okay, you ready? I’m gonna let you
go. Ready?

DANNY (on video)
Yes.

BECCA (on video)
Here goes. There! Whoa! Keep
your feet up.

HOWIE (on video)
Danny, look at me on the way back.

BECCA (on video)
Keep your feet up, Danny.

Howie continues to watch the video.
28.

A_ BLANK BLACK PAGE

The hand reaches into frame and starts to place cutouts of
the earlier seen portal openings on top of each other.

The hand cuts out several more portal openings and adds them
to the intersecting group.

We pull back to reveal a large network of intersecting
tunnels.

INT. BECCA AND HOWIE'S EXERCISE ROOM — MORNING

Becca is working out on the elliptical, listening to her
Ipod, when Howie enters the room dressed for work.

She looks over at him but doesn't stop her work-out.

BECCA
Hey.

HOWIE
(after a pause)
If you're not gonna go to Group, I
think you should see someone.
(pause - no response)

BECCA
Uh-huh.

HOWIE
Any plans for the day?

BECCA
You're looking at ‘em.

HOWIE
(pause)
Well, I’1l see you tonight.

BECCA
Yup.

Becca never stops her workout. Howie heads upstairs.
29.

INT. BECCA AND HOWIE'S EXERCISE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Becca is at the window, still winded and sweaty from her
exercise, watching as Howie pulls out from his parking spot
in front of the house.

As soon as he drives off, she darts up the stairs.
INT. BECCA AND HOWIE'S BEDROOM - A MOMENT LATER

Becca is rifling through her closet looking for an outfit.
She pulls out a couple business suits, wrapped in plastic,
and looks them over. She hasn't seen these in awhile.

She holds one of the suits up to herself. She looks slightly
pained. Is she really going to do this?

SAME - A LITTLE LATER

Showered and dressed, Becca applies a little makeup, then
checks herself out in the mirror. She looks good.

EXT. TRAIN STATION — A MOMENT LATER

Becca, coffee and newspaper in hand, heads up to the train
platform just as the train pulls in. This all feels so
familiar to her.

EXT. MIDTOWN — MANHATTAN — DAY

Becca walks towards us on a sidewalk. The streets are packed
with people, and the sidewalks cramped with fruit stands and
kebab carts. Becca loves it all. Back in her element.

A SHOT of the top of a sculptural Frank Gehry-like mirrored
building. We tilt down to find an ebullient Becca crossing
the street and entering the building.

INT. SOTHEBY'S LOBBY - DAY

It's all glass and class in here. Becca approaches a
RECEPTIONIST at the reception desk. She's all smiles and
confidence.

BECCA
Hi, I'm here to see Scott Bader in
the Events Department.
The Receptionist searches her computer for the name.

RECEPTIONIST
I don't have a Bader listed.

BECCA
Oh. Well that’s weird.

30.

Her heart sinks. Not what she planned on. What to do now?

BECCA
Kate Finn. What about Kate?

RECEPTIONIST
I have a Robert Finn in Dec. Arts?
(Becca shakes her head)
If you have an appointment, I can
just call up there. Who are you?

BECCA
(on the ropes a bit)
Um...I’m just...I didn’t have an
appointment actually. I'm just an
old friend. I used to work here.

She eyes her. She doesn’t remember her.

GARY (0.S.)
Becca?

She turns to see a youngish guy in a suit, GARY, standing
there with a Starbucks tray of several coffees. Former frat-
boy type. Becca doesn't recognize him at first, but then...

BECCA
Gary?

GARY
Heeey. What are you doing here?

BECCA
Um...I had some errands in the
city, and thought I'd pop in and
say hello. But apparently nobody
works here anymore.

GARY
Oh yeah, Scott went over to
Christie's back in March. The
traitor.
31.

BECCA
Well nice to see you’re still doing
the coffee runs at least.

GARY
Oh, no, I don’t usually-- Um, I’m
in Scott’s old job.

Becca is clearly surprised, and a little confused.

The lobby seems to be filled with people younger and better
dressed than Becca is. Being here suddenly feels like a big
mistake. Becca fights the impulse to run for the exit.

GARY
Hey, how's the family?

BECCA
You know what, Gary? I know how
busy it gets up there, so I’m gonna
let you get back to it.

GARY
(chuckles )
Yeah, that hasn't changed.

BECCA
It was great to see you though.

GARY
Yeah, you too.

And she takes off. In her haste, she nearly gets taken out
by the revolving door. She waits for the next opening, and
makes her exit.

Gary just stands with the coffees in the middle of the lobby,
watching her go. That was weird.

EXT. MANHATTAN STREET - DAY

Becca hurries down the street, shaken up, and eager to get

back home. Coming here was a terrible idea.

EXT. SUBURBAN STREET — LARCHMONT - DAY

 

Becca drives with a purpose. She checks the time on her
watch. If she hurries she can still make it.
32.

EXT. TREE-LINED STREET - OUTSIDE JASON'S HOUSE - DAY

Becca is in her car, back in her spot, parked a safe distance
from Jason’s house.

Finally the school bus pulls up the hill. Becca slumps down
in her seat so as not to be seen.

The bus pulls over. Becca peeks up over the steering wheel
and watches as Jason gets off followed by the 14-year-old
Girl. She walks off while Jason pauses on the sidewalk to
adjust his backpack. The bus pulls away.

But instead of heading to his house, Jason walks toward
Becca.

BECCA
Shit.

Panicked, she grabs a baseball cap from the backseat and
quickly puts it on.

Jason, meanwhile, doesn't even notice her. He walks right
past the car, and down the street.

Becca looks up tentatively, and watches in the rearview
mirror as Jason disappears around the corner.

Becca starts the car, pulls away, and bangs a U-Turn, driving
back in the direction Jason is headed.

EXT. LARCHMONT RESIDENTIAL STREET - MOMENTS LATER

 

Becca trails him in the car, keeping a safe distance.

EXT. LARCHMONT AVENUE — MOMENTS LATER

 

Becca slows as she sees him head towards the entrance of a
public library. She turns to park.

INT. LARCHMONT PUBLIC LIBRARY - MOMENTS LATER

Jason is returning a book to an elderly LIBRARIAN.

LIBRARIAN
Well there are fines you know.
33.

JASON
No, I know.

LIBRARIAN
The book’s quite overdue. We've
sent out several notices.

JASON
Yeah, that's why I'm here.

LIBRARIAN
Seven dollars.

Becca spies all this from behind a row of bookcases,
pretending to browse the stacks.

She watches as Jason pays the late fee. The librarian takes
the money, and heads into a back room. Jason, meanwhile,
heads off into another part of the library.

When the coast is clear Becca approaches the front desk.

She looks down at the book Jason returned - "Parallel
Universes" by Fred Alan Wolf. Pretty dry stuff.

LIBRARIAN (0.S.)
Can I help you?

Becca looks up to find the librarian back at her station.

BECCA
Uh, yes, actually. Would it be
possible for me to check this out?
Becca smiles at the librarian.
LIBRARIAN
Certainly.

INT. LIBRARY CHILDREN'S SECTION - MOMENTS LATER

 

Becca is heading for the exit with the book, when something
stops her. In the children's section a young mom, ABBY, is
reading "The Runaway Bunny" to her little girl, LILLY, 3.

ABBY
"I will become a fish in a trout
stream and I will swim away from
you.” Look he’s--
34.

LILLY
He's in the water.

ABBY
Yes, he is, "If you become a fish
in the trout stream, said his
mother, I will become a fisherman
and I will fish for you."

Becca turns away abruptly and makes for the exit. But not
before she smacks straight into Jason.

BECCA
Oh! Sorry.

Then she sees it's him. They both stand there, stunned, a
little terrified. It's as if time has stopped for a moment.

Jason sees the Parallel Universes book in her arm and looks

as if he's about to speak, when Becca turns and hurries out
of the library. He just watches her go, shaken.

INT. HOWIE'S OFFICE — DAY

Howie is trying to work. Rick pops his head in.

RICK
Hey.

HOWIE
Hey.

RICK

I just scored Yankee tickets offa
Rowan. Tonight. You interested?

HOWIE
(really considers it)
I can’t. I have Group.

RICK
You can't skip one night? They're
behind home plate.

HOWIE
Another time.

RICK
If there is one.

Rick takes off.
35.

INT. MEETING HALL — COMMUNITY CENTER — NIGHT

Howie stands by himself with a cup of coffee, looking more
out of place than usual. Gabby and Kevin approach.

GABBY
Going stag tonight?

HOWIE
Uh, yeah.

Howie sips his coffee. Gabby obviously wants more info.

HOWIE
Becca's gonna...take a little
break. From the group.

No need to say more that. Gabby smiles sympathetically.
Kevin actually looks envious - lucky Becca.

KEVIN
I’m gonna get a coffee.
(heads off)

GABBY
(to Howie)
Wanna sit?
HOWIE
Yeah.

INT. NAT'S LIVING ROOM —- NIGHT

Nat is on the couch watching television when her phone rings.
She reaches under some newspapers and answers it.

NAT
Hello?

INT. BECCA'S KITCHEN - INTERCUT PHONE CALL

BECCA
Hey Mom, it's me.

NAT
What's wrong?
36.

BECCA
Nothing. I was just...thinking
about making Izzy's birthday cake.
Would that be alright?

NAT
Oh Honey, you don't need to do all
that. I was just gonna grab her
one of those Carvel things. She
likes those.

BECCA
(makes a face)
I don't mind. It'll give me
something to do.

NAT
Okay then.

Becca checks the fridge to make sure she has everything she
needs.

NAT
No group tonight?

BECCA
Howie's there. It's too much God
talk for me, so...
(silence on the other end)
What.

NAT
Nothing. It’s just...some people
find that comforting.

BECCA
Yeah, well, it pisses me off.

NAT
You know, Becca, when your brother
died, I found the church very
helpful.

BECCA
I know you did, but that's you, not
me. And Danny isn’t Arthur.

NAT
I don’t know why you don’t believe
in god anyway. I brought you to
church every Sunday--
37.

BECCA
(laughing)
Let’s not start this again, okay
mom? I was just calling about the
cake--

NAT
You’re not right about everything,
you know. What if there is a God?

BECCA
Then I’d say he's a sadistic prick.

NAT
Alright, Becca. That’s enough.

BECCA
"Worship me and I'll treat you like
shit." No wonder you like him, he

sounds just like Dad.

It’s like a slap. Nat covers the mouthpiece with her hand.
Becca immediately regrets it. Where did that come from?

BECCA
I'm sorry.

Nat takes a breath, then removes her hand from the phone.

NAT
You're gonna do the cake then?

BECCA
Yeah.

NAT
Right, I'll see you tomorrow.

Nat hangs up abruptly.

INT. HOWIE'S CAR — GOING TO THE PARTY - A LITTLE LATER

BECCA
Who has a birthday party at a
bowling alley anyway? Izzy thinks
she's still fourteen.
38.

HOWIE
If you're not up to this we don’t
have to go--

BECCA
No, it’s just a party. I’1l be
fine.

Becca checks the back seat. A cakebox is carefully placed
there. She also notices Danny’s booster seat and gets a
little pang.

BECCA
I really wish you’d take that out
of here, Howie.

HOWIE
You’re hardly in this car, what's
the difference?

BECCA
It’s just weird.

They drive in silence. Howie’s trying to get up the nerve to
broach a topic. Alright, here goes...

HOWIE
What if we give it another try?
(off her silence)
Another baby?

Becca turns to him, expressionless. Cars fly by outside.

BECCA
What?

HOWIE
Well we're not getting any younger.
So if we're thinking about it--

BECCA
Is that what the sex thing was
about the other night?

HOWIE
No--

BECCA
You trying to get me pregnant?
39.

HOWIE
Becca, no, of course not. I know
it's scary, but maybe it
might...help us get us back on
track.

BECCA
On track?

HOWIE
What, we can’t talk about it?

BECCA
I think we should sell the house.
(off his blank look)
I've been thinking about it, and
since we're on the topic--

HOWIE
How were we on the topic?

BECCA
I’ve talked to a realtor and she
thinks we can pull together an open
house pretty quickly--

HOWIE
What do you mean you talked to a
realtor?

BECCA
We'd probably take a loss in this
market but--

HOWIE

Why would you talk to a realtor
without telling me?

BECCA
I’m telling you now.

Howie is confused and put out by this information.

BECCA
You want to get us back on track, I
think it'd help if we moved.

HOWIE
We love that house.
40.

BECCA
He's everywhere, Howie. The
puzzles, the fingerprints on the
door jambs--

HOWIE
(taking eyes off the road)
I like seeing his fingerprints--

BECCA
That’s because you don’t have to
sit and stare at them all day. You
get to go to work. You get to
escape!

HOWIE
I don’t want to move!

BECCA
And I don’t want another baby!

Becca looks through the windshield...
BECCA
(gasps)
HOWIE

Jesus!

Directly ahead of them a car has stopped at a light. Howie
slams on the brakes. They are pitched forward.

The tires lock and screech. Becca clutches the dashboard with
her eyes closed.

The car comes to a stop behind the car with a couple of feet
to spare. Silence. Becca opens her eyes, and nods. She
takes a deep breath. Then...she leans over into the back
seat.

HOWIE
What are you doing?

BECCA
What do you think I’m doing? I’m
checking the cake. It’s fine.

And she does. Howie’s jaw tightens, and he restarts the car.
41.

INT. BOWLING ALLEY —- DAY

This place is a dive, but everyone's having fun. Becca's
cake has been sliced up and handed out. REEMA and several of
Izzy's other FRIENDS take turns bowling and drinking beer.

Becca, trying hard to be chipper, is the official score-
keeper. Auggie and Nat are in the midst of a heated but good
natured argument. Nat, tipsy, keeps filling a cup with wine.

AUGGIE
Are you kidding? The Kennedys?
With the assassinations...the

lobotomy...?!

NAT
Yeah, but that’s not a curse
though. That's just bad luck.

AUGGIE
The plane crashes?

NAT
Too much money, that's their curse.
If those Kennedys lived like normal
people, most of them would still be
alive.

IZZY
I think it’s sad.

NAT
Of course it’s sad. All those good-
looking people falling out of the
sky like that. It’s a friggin’
waste.

BECCA
(whispers to Izzy)
Didn't I say no wine?

IZZY
She brought it herself.

NAT
Isn't this nice? Sitting around
talking politics? I never do this.
It’s a nice change.

BECCA
Let’s do gifts.
42.

IZZY
Yes! Pass ‘em!

Becca grabs a big present and hands it over to Izzy.

BECCA
Okay. It’s heavy.
IZZY
It’s so pretty. I hate to rip it

open.

But she does. Izzy unwraps a tasteful bathroom set. Beat.
People respond politely. Auggie looks confused.

HOWIE
It's a bathroom set.

BECCA
It's more of a practical gift.

IZZY
Is this your way of telling me you
don't like my Three Stooges shower
curtain?

BECCA
I didn't know what to get you.

IZZY
Seriously, this is great.
AUGGIE
Say thank you.
IZZY
Thank you, Becca. Thank you,
Howie.
HOWIE

(chuckles a little)
Don't thank me, Becca picked it
out.

(off Becca's look)
What?

NAT
Okay, now me.

Nat hands a gift to Izzy...

NAT
I know it’s a little early but--
43.

Izzy unwraps maternity clothes. Much warmer response.

IZZY
Oh, my God! So sweet. Thank you,
Mommy .

Izzy hugs her mom. Becca looks uncomfortable.

BECCA
I thought we weren't doing baby
stuff. For the birthday.
(off their looks)
I thought we'd wait for the shower.

NAT
No honey, it's not baby stuff, it's
mommy stuff.

IZZY
(xe: towels and such)
This is perfect, Bec. I needed a
bathroom set.

BECCA
Yeah, but you need baby stuff more.

HOWIE
We can take it back.

BECCA
That's right, we should. I'll get
you a basket of Mustela lotions.
They prevent stretch marks...

Becca tries to take the gift back.
IZZY
Becca, let go. You can get me the
lotions another time.

They struggle over it. Becca finally lets go.

IZZY
Thank you.

Silence. Becca is embarrassed. This is awkward. Becca
regains her composure and hands Izzy another present.

BECCA
Here.
44,

SAME — LATER THAT NIGHT

Things are much rowdier. Izzy's friends bowl like drunken
fools. Becca and Howie with Nat, who’s pretty sloshed.

NAT
Oh, I just remembered what I was
gonna say about Aristotle Onassis!
It was about the son who died in
the plane crash!

Becca looks at her watch. People bowl.

BECCA
(to Howie)
You ready to go?

HOWIE
Yeah.

NAT

You should’ve stopped me from going
off on that Kennedy stuff, because
my point was about Onassis and how
he put up a reward to anyone who
could prove that someone had
sabotaged his son’s plane. He was
so desperate to blame somebody.

(to Howie)
Did you read this?

Howie gets up to leave, but Nat keeps talking.

NAT
He needed a reason for losing his
son.

BECCA
Mom, why are you telling this
story?

NAT

I'm just talking. I can't talk?

BECCA
You never just talk.

Becca and Howie gather up their coats and things. Izzy comes
over to say goodbye. Izzy, sensing the danger, tries to
defuse the ticking bomb.
45.

IZZY
Thank you guys for coming to my
party. Becca the cake was so good.

NAT
You forget what I went through when
your brother died. You think I
don't know anything, but I do
Becca!

BECCA
Like who to blame?

Things are getting tense now. Izzy's friends notice.

IZZY
You guys, this is my party.

AUGGIE
(takes her hand)
Let em’ go. That’s not on you.

NAT
I'm not talking about blame, I'm
talking about comfort.

BECCA
Ohhh, comfort. Well then.

NAT
Where are you getting it?

BECCA
Comfort? I'm not.

NAT
Well I think you should.

BECCA
Okay. I'll get right on that then.
See what I can dig up on eBay.

NAT
I'm just trying to help you, Becca.
I wish someone had given me a
little advice when Arthur died.

Becca turns on her mother and lashes out...
46.

BECCA
You know what I wish? I wish you
would stop comparing Danny to
Arthur! Danny was a four-year-old
boy who chased his dog into the
street! Arthur was a thirty-year-
old heroin addict who OD’d!
Frankly I resent how you keep
lumping them together!

Nothing but the sound of jukebox music and falling pins.

NAT
He was still my son.

Becca gathers up her things. Howie, looking deeply
uncomfortable, helps to usher her out.

BECCA
We’re gonna go. Izzy, I hope you
enjoy the bathroom set.

IZZY
I'm gonna.

Becca and Howie head out. No one else moves.

NAT
When Arthur died, I was just as
upset as she was, but I never took
it out on other people.

IZZY
What about Mrs. Bailey?

NAT
Nobody's talking about Mrs. Bailey!

INT. HOWIE'S CAR - GOING HOME FROM THE PARTY - A LITTLE LATER
Becca and Howie drive in silence.

A_BLANK PIECE OF BLACK PAPER

The hand appears over a black piece of paper with cutouts of
intersecting tunnels. The hand paints three faces in a white
portal opening. First a woman, then a man, then a boy.

He does this several more times in other portals, varying the

three faces - sometimes all three, sometimes just one or two,
and sometimes none at all.
47.

INT. HOWIE AND BECCA’S BEDROOM — THE NEXT MORNING

Becca is at her mirror. She adjusts the blouse she’s
wearing. It’s cheery. Classy but cheery.

HOWIE (0.S.)
Hey, did you call that guy about
the roof?
BECCA
I couldn’t find the number.
HOWIE (0.S.)
It’s in my phone. It’s on the

mantle.

Becca moves to the phone and picks it up. Howie comes in from
their bathroom, buttoning up his shirt. Becca seems to be
having some trouble with the phone.

BECCA
What’s his name?

HOWIE
It’s not under his name.

BECCA
(pressing buttons)
Then how am I supposed to call him
if I--?

HOWIE
It’s under Roof Guy.

BECCA
(a little chuckle)
Roof Guy.

HOWIE
Well what was I supposed to put it
under.

Becca looks for the number but has trouble with the touch
screen on the phone.

BECCA
I don’t know how to use this thing.
It doesn’t--

Howie looks over her shoulder, and tries to help...
48.

HOWIE
(gently)
Okay, now scroll down.

BECCA
(she tries to)
Now what?

HOWIE
Scroll down with your finger.

BECCA
You do it.

Howie reaches over and finds the number on the phone for her.

HOWIE
Roof guy.

BECCA
Thank you.

It's just a small tender marital moment. And then Howie goes
back to getting dressed.

EXT. TREE-LINED STREET - OUTSIDE JASON'S HOUSE - DAY

 

Becca is back in her spot, only this time she’s standing on
the sidewalk next to her car, waiting nervously. She’s
wearing her cheery top.

Finally the bus pulls up the hill. Becca fixes her hair a
little. She waits with anticipation.

The bus stops and lets out...the 14-year-old Girl. No Jason.
Becca is confused and disappointed. She’s about to get back
in her car when...

JASON (0.S.)
Are you waiting for me?

Becca turns to see Jason standing on the sidewalk behind her.
She's obviously taken aback.

BECCA
Oh. Um, hi. Yeah, I...I'm sorry,
I thought you took the bus.

JASON
I do.

BECCA
Right. But not...?
49,

JASON
Not today, no. Today I skipped
school.

BECCA
Oh. Well...
(tries to make a joke)
---you shouldn't be playing hooky,
young man.

A little nervous laugh from her. Lame.

JASON
Why are you waiting for me?

BECCA
I thought we could talk?

JASON
(beat)
About what?

But she doesn’t respond. Jason isn’t sure what to make of
her.

EXT. PARK - A LITTLE LATER

Jason and Becca sit on a park bench. Way off in the distance
children play on a jungle gym.

BECCA
Is this okay?

JASON
Yeah. It’s fine.

BECCA
It's not too weird?

JASON
Um, no. I mean...

BECCA
No, I know. It’s weird for me too.

Becca tries to smile. Now what?

BECCA
Don’t you like school?

JASON
I like it alright.
50.

BECCA
Okay. I just thought, you seem to
not be going so--

JASON
I’ve been accepted to college
already, so...

BECCA
Oh. So it’s not a big deal then.

JASON
No, it is a big deal, but...only if
my mother finds out.

BECCA
I see.

JASON
She said she’d confiscate my phone
if I did it again.
(beat )
Not that I use the phone anyway.

Jason nervously picks at the wood of the bench.

BECCA
Where are you headed?

JASON
Connecticut College.

BECCA
That's a good school. And not too
far. Your parents must be happy.

JASON
It's just my mom, but yeah, she's
pretty happy about it.

BECCA
I bet.

JASON
She keeps saying she's gonna apply
to the grad program so she can keep
an eye on me while I'm up there.
(beat )
She's just joking though.

Becca nods politely.
51.

JASON
She's not really looking forward to
it, since I'm the only one at home
now, but I told her I'd come back
on the weekends if I could.

BECCA
That'll be nice.

More silence. Jason looks over at the kids playing.

JASON
(simply)
So, I'm sorry.

BECCA
(surprised by the topic)
Oh, I know, you don't have to--

JASON
I know that doesn't help, but...
BECCA
No it does. It really does.
JASON
And I know I should've tried to get
in touch--
BECCA

No, it’s fine.

JASON
I just really wish I had driven
down a different block that day.

BECCA
(beat)
I know.

Jason hasn't looked at her during this exchange.

JASON
You know what? I should maybe go.

BECCA
It’s alright.

JASON
My mom’s gonna start to wonder
where I’m at--
52.

BECCA
That's okay. You really don’t have
to--

Jason gets up to go. Becca is a little confused by his
abruptness. Then Jason stops, and he faces her.

JASON
Could we do this again sometime?

BECCA
(beat)
Sure.

Jason nods, and takes off, leaving Becca alone on the bench.

EXT. COMMUNITY CENTER PARKING LOT - NIGHT

 

Howie gets out of his car and starts to walk toward the
building where Group is held. Only something slows his step.

At the other end of the parking lot he sees a car idling.
Gabby is sitting in the driver’s seat. Just sitting there.
Something isn’t right. Howie walks towards her, concerned.

As he comes around the passenger’s side, and looks in the
open window, everything becomes clear. Gabby is firing up a
bowl. She takes a huge toke, and only then sees Howie.

GABBY
Jesus Christ!

She tosses the bowl in the ashtray. Howie is really amused.

HOWIE
Hey, Gabby.

GABBY
I can’t believe you just saw me do
that.

HOWIE

I didn’t mean to sneak up on you.
I thought something was wrong. But
obviously everything...smells fine.

GABBY
You can smell it huh?
(laughing and waving smoke
outside)
God, everyone in there is gonna
know. I swear I never do this.

 
53.

HOWIE
Where’s Kevin?

GABBY
He’s not coming to group. And I
blame your wife by the way. I
think she put the idea in his head.

HOWIE
Well, he didn’t seem to really like
group all that much.

GABBY
He’s gotten me all upset. I mean,
look at me. Smoking pot ina
parking lot. It’s like I’m in high
school. I’m ridiculous.

HOWIE
Do you have any more?

Gabby chuckles. Then...she realizes he’s serious. And Howie
smiles like a naughty child.

GABBY
Yeah! Come on in, partner!

INT. MEETING HALL —- COMMUNITY CENTER - NIGHT

The support group is well underway. Howie and Gabby sit in
the circle of chairs. They are both pretty stoned. Another
grieving couple speaks...

BOB
Well if today is rage day, most of
you know that I am a little more
comfortable with rage. Talking
about rage. I deal with rage every
single day. And I listen to these
guys at work, and they go on and on
about paving their driveways, or
whatever, just the most stupid
nonsense. They don’t know. They
haven't had their lives ripped
apart yet.

Howie starts to snicker quietly. Gabby dare not look at him.
She is biting the insides of her cheeks so as not to laugh.

MARY
They’re not in the club.
54.

BOB
Exactly. Meanwhile, I’m sitting
there like, “Hey guys, my daughter
died of leukemia--!"”

A burst of laughter escapes from Howie. A few people turn to
him. He clears his throat and stands.

HOWIE
I’m sorry, I need some water.

He gets up. Gabby closes her eyes, again so as not to laugh.

EXT. COMMUNITY CENTER PARKING LOT - END OF THE NIGHT
The meeting has let out. Howie and Gabby walk out together.

HOWIE
You’re one of those bad kids my
mother warned me about.

GABBY
Yes, I am corrupting you.
(re: the pot)
Don’t worry, I won’t tell Becca.
HOWIE
(beat)
I'd appreciate that.

GABBY
Good night.

HOWIE
Good night.

They part ways, heading off to their respective cars.

INT. LIVING ROOM —- LATER THAT NIGHT

 

Howie plunks down into his chair and whips out his I-Phone,
still stoned. He clicks through his applications looking for
something. He can’t find it. Howie is confused.

He clicks the screen of his phone repeatedly, panic starts to
set in. He scrolls through. Something is very wrong.

INT. BEDROOM / STAIRWAY / HALL - SIMULTANEOUS

Becca is reading the Parallel Universes book when she hears
Howie yelling.
55.

HOWIE (0.S.)
Becca?! What'd you do here?!

BECCA
What?

We stay on Becca as she dashes from the bedroom, down the
stairs, and toward the living room, everything reeling.

INT. LIVING ROOM — CONTINUOUS

Howie stands in the middle of the room scrolling through his
I-Phone applications. He's beside himself. Becca stands in
the doorway, scared.

HOWIE
Goddamn it, what did you do to my
phone?

BECCA
Jesus, Howie. I thought something
had hap--

HOWIE
This morning. When you used it.
What did you do to my phone?

BECCA
Nothing. I just got the number for
the roof guy.

HOWIE
For christsake!

BECCA
What, you told me to call him.

HOWIE
You deleted Danny's video.

BECCA
(beat)
No, no I didn't. No. I just...you
were right there. I just got the

number.

HOWIE
Yeah, and you kept pressing the
screen.

BECCA

Because I couldn't figure out how
to use your phone.
56.

She takes the phone from him and scrolls the screens, trying
to find it.

HOWIE
I checked already. It's gone.

BECCA
(still tapping the screen)
We have a hundred videos of him,

Howie.
HOWIE
That's not the point, Becca.
BECCA
Then you should've put it on your
computer.
HOWIE

Right, it's my fault.
BECCA
(still searching)
I didn't say that.

HOWIE
I said it's gone!

He grabs the phone and hurls it onto the couch.

BECCA
Jesus, Howie! I didn't do it on
purpose!

HOWIE

Are you sure?
Becca stands staring at him, dumbstruck.

BECCA
What does that mean?
(no response)
You think I deliberately deleted
his video?

HOWIE
I don't know.

BECCA
You don't know?

She glares, shaken, waiting for some kind of explanation.
57.

HOWIE
It’s like you're trying to get rid
of him. I'm sorry, but that's how
it feels. Every day, it's
something new.

BECCA
(beat - holds it together)
Really.
HOWIE

Yeah. It’s like you're trying to
get rid of any evidence he was ever
here. You took his paintings off
the fridge.

BECCA
Yes, to save them. They are ina
box downstairs.

 

HOWIE
His clothes?

BECCA
We don’t need all that stuff.

HOWIE
Your wanting to sell the house.
Your sending Taz to your mother's.

BECCA
There was a lot going on, Howie.
The dog got under foot.

HOWIE
Right. And he was a reminder.

BECCA
Yes, he was a reminder, and I
wanted one less reminder around
here.

HOWIE
And since you never wanted the dog.

BECCA
Oh, for godssake.

HOWIE
Well if I hadn't bought the dog--
58.

BECCA
And if I hadn't run in to get the
phone or if I had latched the gate--

HOWIE
I left the gate unlatched!

BECCA
Well I didn’t check it! I’m not
playing this game again Howie. It
was no one’s fault.

 

HOWIE
Not even the dog's. Dogs chase
squirrels, boys chase dogs.

BECCA
I know that.

HOWIE
He loved that dog! And you got rid
of it!
BECCA
Just like I got rid of the video.
HOWIE
(losing it)

It's not just the video! I'm not
talking about the video, Becca!
It's Taz, and the paintings, and
the clothes, and it's everything!
You have to stop erasing him! You
have to stop it! YOU HAVE TO STOP!

Howie's been reduced to tears. He has to move away from her.

Becca takes him in. She seems more confused than affronted.

BECCA
Do you really not know how
impossible that would be? To erase
him? No matter how many things I
box up, do you really think I don't
see him every second of every day?

Howie looks up at her.
59.

BECCA
The video was an accident, Howie.
And believe me, I’ll beat myself up
about it forever, I'm sure. Just
like everything else that I
could've prevented.

HOWIE
That's not what I want, Becca.

BECCA
No? Because it feels like it is.
It feels like maybe I don't feel
badly enough for you.

They stand there, unable to go any further with this.

HOWIE
This isn't... Something has to
change here. Because I can't do
this...like this. It's too hard.
It's too hard.

Howie heads for the door, then stops.

HOWIE
And I want that dog back. Your
mother's making him fat.

BECCA
Howie--

HOWIE
I miss the dog. I'm sorry, but I
miss him. I want him back.

They regard each other silently. Howie heads down the hall,
and then up the stairs, leaving Becca alone.

INT. LIBRARY - DAY

Jason is in a secluded corner, working on his comic book.

In one panel we see the boy passing through the portal in the
science lab. And in the next panel we see him falling

through a rabbit hole in space. The boy looks terrified.

Jason looks up at the clock. Crap, he’s late. He gathers up
his stuff, and runs.
60.

EXT. PARK — DAY

Jason sits eating a lemon square. Becca is beside him.
There’s a tin of lemon squares between them.

JASON
You really made these?

BECCA
I did.

JASON
They're good. Still warm.

BECCA
I'm glad you like them.

They're still pretty formal with each other.

BECCA
So I've been reading that book.
The parallel universe book?

JASON
Yeah? Did you like it?

BECCA
Yeah, it’s interesting. I don’t
know if I buy it - the whole
alternate reality thing - I don’t
know. But it’s interesting. Did
you have to do it for a school
project?

JASON
No. It's research.

BECCA
Oh. Research.

He considers her, then reaches for his backpack. He unzips
it, and pulls out a handful of papers held together by a big
binder clip. He hands the pages to her.

Becca looks down at what is obviously the hand-drawn comic
book we've seen. The cover is very retro and Flash Gordon-
esque. Becca reads the title - “Rabbit Hole.”
61.

JASON
It's a comic book.

She flips through the pages - more incredible pen and ink
drawings: a strange space portal, science fiction action
sequences, a pirate sequence, dinosaurs...

BECCA
Wow, this is...impressive. You did
all this?

JASON
Yeah.

BECCA
Wow. It’s amazing. What's it
about?

JASON

A scientist, I guess. And his son.
The father discovers this network
of holes that leads to other
galaxies and, um--

BECCA
Parallel universes.

JASON
Yeah, but the scientist dies. So
the son goes into this rabbit hole
to try and find him. But it’s not
him, because he's dead, so it’s
like another version of him.

 

Becca is looking down at one panel of the comic book: it’s
one we saw earlier: the father and son playing ball on the
front lawn, the mother with lemonade, and the boy behind the
tree with the “?!" thought bubble over his head.

JASON
I know it's kinda stupid, but...

BECCA
No.

JASON
No? Okay.

BECCA

Not at all. I would love to read
it.
62.

JASON
(gets uncomfortable)
Yeah it’s um...

He reaches out and politely takes it back from her, then
returns it to his backpack.

Silence.

JASON
Sorry. It’s just... it’s not done
yet. But when it is done, I will
let you read it.

 

BECCA
(beat)
Okay.
JASON
Okay.
BECCA

I don't want you to feel
uncomfortable. I--

JASON
(interrupts her)
I might've been going too fast.
(beat)
That day.

Becca doesn't know what to say.

JASON
I'm not sure, but I might’ve been.
So...that's something I've been
wanting to tell you.

She just sits there and listens. Jason's confession is
simple and quiet. There's nothing overwrought about it.

JASON

It's a thirty zone. And I might've
been going thirty-one. Or thirty-
two. I would usually look down, to
check, and if I was a little over,
then I'd slow down obviously. But
I don't remember checking on your
block, so it's possible I was going
too fast. And then the dog ran out
really fast, so I swerved. I
didn’t know... I didn’t know.

A moment between them.
63.

JASON
I thought you should know. I
might've been going a little over
the limit. I can't be positive.

Becca feels many things. But mostly she feels badly for him.

BECCA
It’s okay.

JASON
Okay.

BECCA

I know, okay?

JASON
Thank you.

INT. GABBY'S CAR — COMMUNITY CENTER PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Gabby and Howie are sitting getting stoned again. They smoke
up in silence for several beats before anyone speaks.

HOWIE
I don't wanna go in there.

Gabby looks to him. What are they gonna do instead?
INT. ARCADE - NIGHT

Gabby and Howie are at adjacent lanes playing skee-ball.
They're having a great time. Gabby bowls an impossible shot.

HOWIE
Oh, come on!

GABBY
I’m sorry, you suck...

HOWIE
I'd be doing better but your pot
messed up my depth perception.

Howie makes a fairly good shot.
GABBY
I’m gonna support that one. I’m
totally gonna support that one.

She laughs. They continue to play over the following...
64.

GABBY
Hey you know what. I have a
confession to make. Remember when I
said Kevin left Group?

HOWIE
Yeah.

GABBY
What I meant to say...is that he
left me. He left me.

Howie continues to bowl, not really sure how to respond.

GABBY
Yeah. I came home and he was gone.

HOWIE
Wow. No note or--

GABBY
Oh there was a note. Well, nota
note so much as a manifesto. On
all the ways that we were
destroying each other.

HOWIE
Jesus. I'm sorry.

GABBY
Well...this is generally how it
goes, right? It changes you. It
literally changes people. Part of
me thinks it was inevitable.

This suddenly feels dangerous. They skee-ball in silence.

HOWIE
I love my wife.

GABBY
(pause)
Of course you do.

HOWIE
I love her very much.

GABBY
Okay.
65.

INT. LIVING ROOM — HOWIE AND BECCA'S HOUSE — LATER THAT NIGHT

 

Becca is on the couch reading the Parallel Universe book,
when she hears Howie come in the front door. She immediately
tucks the book behind a couch cushion, and grabs a magazine.

INT. FOYER — CONTINUOUS

Howie hangs his keys by the door. Then, seeing the living
room light on, he feels a pang of guilt.

INT. LIVING ROOM — CONTINUOUS

Howie stands in the archway for a couple beats before Becca
looks up at him.

HOWIE
So I think you're right. We should

maybe look into selling the house.
It's probably for the best.

Becca barely responds. Why the sudden change in opinion?

BECCA
Okay.

She watches as Howie turns and heads upstairs.

INT. DANNY'S ROOM —- A COUPLE WEEKS LATER

 

Nat is helping Becca clean out Danny's room. Becca is
putting Danny's books into a milk crate. Nat is taking toys,
stuffed animals, puzzles, etc., out of a toy box and placing
them into a garbage bag, or into a keep-box.

Something stops Nat. She's pulled one of Danny's sneakers
out of the toy box. It's smaller than she remembers. Becca
glances over at her and realizes what's happening.

BECCA
Don't do that.
(takes the sneaker)
Quick and clean, like a band-aid.
Or we'll never get through this.

Becca places the sneaker into a garbage bag, passes Nat a
Kleenex, and carries on as if the moment never happened.

Nat grabs a couple toys, accidentally flipping the switch to
an obnoxiously loud flashing toy.
66.

NAT
I don't know how to turn it off.

It takes a moment, but Becca switches off the toy.

BECCA
Only people without children give
gifts like this.

She pops it into the keep-box with a smile.

NAT

Have you heard from Debbie yet?
BECCA

Nope.
NAT

That's too bad. But it can be

worse the other way, you know. I

remember when Arthur died--
(stops herself)

Sorry.

Nat bites her tongue and moves away. Becca feels badly.

BECCA
You can say his name.

NAT
Can I? I don't know your rules,
Becca. I don't wanna get scolded
again.

BECCA
You can talk about Arthur. I just
don't like the comparisons.

NAT
(beat)
Okay.

A moment passes between them. Over the following, they
continue to organize the toys...

BECCA
(begrudgingly)
So how is it worse?

NAT
You remember Maureen Bailey?

BECCA
Yeah.
67.

NAT
I couldn't get rid of her after
your brother passed away. She was
always at the house.

BECCA
Yeah, I remember that.

NAT
Yeah well, I never had a moment to
myself. So finally in the middle
of coffee one afternoon, I said,
"Maureen, why are you always here?"

BECCA
What'd she say?

NAT
She said, "I wanna be there, Nat, I
wanna share in your grief." And so

I said "Well it's not working. You
plant your fat ass in that chair
every frickin' day--"

BECCA
You did not say that.

NAT

I did! "And you suck up all my
coffee, and I don't see you leaving
with any of this grief you're
allegedly sharing with me. In fact
the only thing you do take outta
here are my cinnamon buns."

(beat )
So I never saw her again obviously.

Nat shrugs. She gets a genuine chuckle out of Becca.

NAT
I feel guilty now.

BECCA
You do not.

NAT
(laughing)
I do.
(then)
You’re right, I don’t. I don’t
miss her at all.
68.

EXT. BECCA’s HOME — DAY

It is a bright sunny day. Becca’s home has an “open house”
sign in front of it.

EXT. BECCA’S BACKYARD — SAME DAY

Taz is back. Howie puts him on a runner in the back yard.

INT. BECCA'S KITCHEN - A MOMENT LATER

Becca pulls a warm pie out of the oven. It looks perfect.
She moves it to the counter.

Howie enters through the back door carrying Taz’s leash.

HOWIE
That takes care of Taz.
(eyes the pie)
Ah, the ol' apple pie trick, eh?

BECCA
What?

HOWIE
For the Open House. Warm baked
goods makes it feel homier. I
thought you were doing it for the
Open House.

BECCA
Oh. No, I was just making a pie.

Howie shrugs - wrong again. Becca tidies up.

HOWIE
So, you’re not gonna stay?

BECCA
God, no. You shouldn't either.
(off his chuckle)
You shouldn't.

HOWIE
Come on, I'm not gonna bother
anyone.
69.

INT. FOYER — LATER THAT MORNING

Howie is chatting with the slightly uptight middle-aged
realtor woman, RHONDA. Becca's getting ready to go.

HOWIE
So we have the garbage cans in the
back, the sign out front. I mowed
the lawn. I thought we’d set the
sign-in sheet here, and they could
move into the living room.

RHONDA
That's fine.

HOWIE
My wife's gonna go hide out, but
I'll stick around, if that's okay
with you.

Rhonda pauses slightly.

RHONDA
Sure. However you want to do it.

Becca heads out.

BECCA
Okay.

HOWIE
Bye.
(back to Rhonda)
I think that’s everything.

EXT. PARK —- A LITTLE LATER

Becca sits reading the parallel universe book on the same
bench she sat with Jason. She didn't make plans with him,
but half-hopes she might see him here. She puts down the
book and looks around.

There are parents minding their kids on the jungle gym.
There's a couple sitting on the grass, sharing a newspaper.
A group of guys play touch-football. Only Becca is by
herself, and she feels it maybe harder than she ever has.
70.

INT. HOWIE AND BECCA'S FOYER —- DAY

Howie stands expectantly with a clipboard as a suburban
couple (CRAIG and DONNA) with a four year old son, CADEN,
come in from the living room with Rhonda.

HOWIE
Southwestern exposures. Sun all
day.

DONNA

The layout is exactly what we've
been looking for.

CRAIG
(to Donna)
And the light in here.

DONNA
I know, it's beautiful.

RHONDA
Why don’t we take a look upstairs?

HOWIE
That's a great idea. I’11 show
you. Follow me.

He takes over, leading them upstairs. Rhonda is peeved.

INT. DANNY'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Howie is leading the family past the doorway...

HOWIE
We can start in the master bedroom
if you want to see--

But the wife stops and ducks into Danny’s room.

DONNA
What’s in here?

HOWIE
Oh, that’s, uh--

The family enters the room. Howie follows them in. Rhonda
appears in the doorway, concerned as to how this might go.

HOWIE
This could be a good room for the
little guy, obviously.
71.

CRAIG
How about that, buddy? You like
this room?

The boy makes a b-line for one of Danny's wind-up robots.
Howie is immediately on edge.

HOWIE
Oo, careful with that.

DONNA
That's not yours, honey.

The boy reluctantly puts the toy down.

CRAIG
How old's your son?
(off Howie's blank look)
This is your son's room, I assume?

HOWIE
Uh, yeah. I mean...it was,
but..-he died.

Rhonda lowers her eyes. This is not the thing to say. The
couple looks confused. This is suddenly very awkward.

HOWIE
Yeah, a car. Right out front.
DONNA
Oh my god.
CRAIG
I’m so sorry.
HOWIE
Thank you.
DONNA

This must be so difficult for you.

HOWIE

Yeah, it's pretty weird. I still
forget he's not here sometimes.
Like maybe he's just hiding under
the bed or something, and he's
gonna pop out. That’s what he used
to do.

(looks around)
I still feel him here.

This comes out weirder than Howie intends. The parents are a
little creeped out. The little boy looks to the bed.
72.

HOWIE
(beat)
Would you like to see the master
bedroom?

INT. IZZY'S BATHROOM —- MOMENTS LATER

 

Izzy, toothbrush in hand, is just finishing a phone call.

IZZY
(on phone)
Yeah, I'll be there.

She hangs up her cell phone. Auggie pops his head in.

AUGGIE
Who was that?

IZZY
Becca. She wants to “hang out.”

Auggie looks as confused as Izzy. She grabs one of her new
hand towels (from Becca's bathroom set) and wipes her mouth.
The newly decorated bathroom looks fantastic.

INT. UPSCALE NAIL SALON — DAY

Izzy and Becca sit side by side getting pedicures. Becca
flips through a magazine. The PEDICURISTS work in silence.

IZZY
This was a good idea.

BECCA
Nice, right?

Becca glances over at Izzy's belly.

BECCA
You're starting to show so early.

IZZY
I know. I feel like a big ole
balloon. I swear, once this kid is
born I’m going right to the gym.

BECCA
While Mom watches the baby.

Becca smiles and goes back to her magazine. Izzy can't quite
tell if she's just been insulted.
73.

IZZY
What does that mean? “While Mom
watches the baby.”

BECCA
While you're at the gym, Mom can
watch the baby. She loves that.

IZZY
No, Auggie can watch the baby. He
works nights, so he'll be home.

BECCA
Okay. Auggie, then.

Becca passes her a magazine. Izzy is fighting to bite her
tongue, but it’s a losing the battle.

IZZY
If you’re gonna be mean to me, then
I might as well stay home.

BECCA
What’d I say?

IZZY
You think I'm not cut out to be a
good mother.

BECCA
That is not what I think.

IZZY
I know I'm not as organized as you
are, or homey, or whatever--

BECCA
Nobody's comparing us.

IZZY
Really? Because that'd be a first.

BECCA
Honestly, Izzy, I don't know what
this is about.

IZZY
It's about me being a capable
person who can raise a child, and
look after it and protect it.

It’s not Izzy’s intention but this wounds Becca.
74.

IZZY
I resent the feeling I get from you
that I don't deserve the baby. Or
that I'm not mature enough, or
smart enough or something, to take
care of it. I mean, my god, if Mom
could do it, how hard could it be?

Silence. They stare at each other. Then Becca goes back to
her reading.

INT. SUPERMARKET — DAY

Becca and Izzy stroll along with the shopping cart. Muzak.

BECCA
This alright?

IZZY
Yeah, it’s fine.

BECCA
I’ve just gotta pick up a few
things and then we can do lunch.

Becca makes her way past walls of sugared kids’ cereals with
colorful boxes. She rolls past, not daring to look at them.

ANOTHER AISLE - A MOMENT LATER

Becca notices a mother, LORI, at the end of the aisle. She
is shopping with her little boy, SAMMY, in the cart. He's
about five, and really not happy.

SAMMY
Please can I have some Fruit Roll-
Ups?

LORI

No, Sammy, you know the answer.

SAMMY
Please? Can I have some, please?

LORI
Sammy. No.

Lori very deliberately turns her back on the boy and scans
the shelf in front of her, ignoring him entirely, which only
angers him more.
SAMMY
I want the Fruit Roll-ups.
LORI
Not happening.
SAMMY
Please, I’1ll be good.
LORI
Stop it.
SAMMY
Please?
LORI
No.
SAMMY
I promise.
LORI

No, I’m not gonna get ‘em.
Becca tries to not pay attention, but it gets under

The boy's whines turn into wails, and still the mom
nothing. It goes on for several beats, until Becca
take it anymore. She is suddenly striding down the
toward them. Surprised, Izzy hurries after her...

But it's too late, Becca is already talking to Lori.

BECCA
You know what? It's only three
bucks, why don't you just get him
the roll-ups?

The boy stops whining. He and Izzy look to Lori to
response. The woman’s eyes narrow.

LORI
Not that it's any of your business,
but we don't allow candy in our
house, and my son knows that.

BECCA
Come on, it’s just fruit. Why don’t
you give him a treat?

76.

LORI
Are you a mom?

The question hangs there. Izzy lowers her eyes. Becca is
obviously caught off-guard. She struggles to respond.

LORI
Yeah, I didn’t think so.
(moves her cart)
Excuse me...

Becca suddenly reaches up and smacks her across the face.
Hard. The woman stares at her, shocked. Becca and Izzy look
equally shocked. Did that really just happen?

The boy looks as if he’s been hit too.

IZZY
Go to the car, Becca.

She doesn't move. Izzy hisses through gritted teeth...

IZZY
I said go to the car.

Becca, slightly dazed, steps away from them. Everything
around her swirls a bit as she breaks into a run and dashes
for the exit.

IZZY
(explains to Lori)
She just lost her son eight months
ago and she’s--

LORI
I don’t care.

INT. BECCA'S CAR — PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

 

Becca and Izzy sit in the car, still shaken.

INT. BECCA AND HOWIE'S KITCHEN - END OF THE DAY

Howie is looking over the sign-in sheet. Taz is barking out
in the yard. Becca and Izzy come in with the grocery bags.

Becca unpacks the groceries over the following...
77.

HOWIE
So? Fun day out?

Becca tosses Izzy a warning glance.

BECCA
How'd it go here?

HOWIE
Not so good. We need to clean out
that room.

BECCA
(pause)
Okay.

HOWIE
Maybe make it into a guest room or
something.
(to Izzy)
Don't get any ideas.

IZZY
Ha-ha.

Then Izzy's smiles disappears. She looks scared. Becca
notices and turns around - what's wrong? Howie turns too.
And then we see...

Jason is standing in the doorway of the kitchen. He's
somehow walked in unnoticed.

IZZY
Jesus...

JASON
Hello. Hi...um...The door was wide
open so...

(no response)
And I knocked, but...

They all stand there, still taken aback by the moment. Taz
is still barking.

HOWIE
Taz! Shut up!

Taz stops barking. They all stare at Jason.
78.

JASON
I saw the sign outside...the Open
House sign, so I thought it’d be

okay to--
HOWIE
You looking to buy a house?
BECCA
Howie--
JASON
No.
JASON

(turns to Becca)
I just came to give you this.

Jason holds out the "Rabbit Hole" comic book to Becca.

JASON
I said I'd let you read it when it
was done, so...

Becca stands motionless. There's no way out of this. She
finally reaches out and takes the book.

BECCA
Thank you.

Howie looks from Becca to the boy, completely dumbstruck.
Izzy is wide-eyed with curiosity. Becca can't even look at
Howie. Jason starts to realize what he's done.

HOWIE
What...what is this?

BECCA
We...bumped into each other, in the
library, and we decided to meet.

HOWIE
You decided to meet.

BECCA
Yeah. A couple times.

Howie shakes his head. This is getting weirder and weirder.

JASON
I'm sorry. I didn't realize--
79.

HOWIE
Did you meet here?

BECCA
No, we met in the park.

HOWIE
You met in the park a couple times.

BECCA
Yeah.

Howie's breathing becomes shallow. He's trying hard to keep
his anger under control. He advances on Jason a little bit.

HOWIE
So my wife agrees to meet you ina
public place, and you...what?
Apologize?

JASON
I guess.

HOWIE
Okay, you apologize, and then what?

BECCA
Alright, Howie, that's enough.
HOWIE
(xe: book)

What is that?

BECCA
It’s a comic book.

HOWIE
It’s a comic book. A comic book.

Izzy looks to her sister like, what the hell?

HOWIE
Did she tell you to bring it here?

BECCA
Howie--

JASON
No, she didn't.
80.

HOWIE
No, she didn't. Because this is
our house. And just because
there's a sign out front doesn't
mean you can pop in.

BECCA
Howie, all right.

HOWIE
No it’s not alright. You don't just
walk into someone's home like that.
You should show a little fucking
respect.

Jason looks to Becca, then makes a quick exit.

They're all silent for a couple beats.

BECCA
(quietly)
You're an asshole.

She goes out after Jason. Howie watches her go. Izzy puts
groceries away.

HOWIE
(whispers to himself)
I’m an asshole.

EXT. SIDEWALKS AROUND HOWIE AND BECCA'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Howie, still rattled, is walking Taz on a leash. The big,
dumb dog is essentially pulling him down the block.

HOWIE
Easy...

He tugs on the leash, but Taz pays no mind. The dog
continues to pant and pull, excited to be out of the yard.
Again, Howie snaps the leash hard, but it hardly does
anything. Howie is getting pissed.

HOWIE
Taz, stop it.

Taz suddenly sees/hears some small animal in the hedged-in
property next to the sidewalk. He leaps towards the hedges,
barking ferociously.
81.

HOWIE
Taz. Taz, stop it!

Howie snaps the leash back way too hard, and Taz lets out a
pained YELP! The dog retreats from the hedges, and cowers.
Howie immediately feels horribly, and runs to him.

HOWIE
Oh, buddy...

He buries his face in the dog's fur. He feels to make sure
he's okay. Howie rubs his neck and pats his fur. Taz looks
up tentative, and licks Howie's hand. The dog's fine. But
Howie feels like a complete and utter heel.

INT. BECCA AND HOWIE'S KITCHEN — EVENING

 

Becca is rolling out dough for a pie crust. Howie appears at
the doorway. He stands and watches for a moment.

HOWIE
Why didn’t you tell me?

She stops and looks up at him.

BECCA
(simply)
For the same reason you don’t tell
me why you come home reeking of
pot.

Howie takes this in. Then retreats quietly from the doorway.
Becca goes back to rolling her pie crust.

INT. GARAGE — DAY

Becca and Nat carry the milk crates of Danny's stuff down to
the basement, and put them in the corner with a few other
things Becca has put aside.

Becca stands there, taking it in. Danny's been reduced to a
small corner of stuff in the basement. She lets out a
breath, then turns to her mother.

BECCA
Does it ever go away?

NAT
What.
82.

BECCA
This feeling.

They lock eyes. Nat can see she actually wants an answer.
Maybe for the first time ever.

NAT
No. I don't think it does. Not
for me it hasn't. And that's goin'
on eleven years.
(beat)
It changes though.

BECCA
How?

NAT
I don't know. The weight of it, I
guess. At some point it becomes
bearable. It turns into something
you can crawl out from under, and
carry around - like a brick in your
pocket. And you forget it every
once in a while, but then you reach
in for whatever reason and there it
is: "Oh right. That." Which can
be awful. But not all the time.
Sometimes it's kinda... Not that
you like it exactly, but it's what
you have instead of your son, so
you don't wanna let go of it
either. So you carry it around.
And it doesn't go away, which is...

 

BECCA
What.

NAT
Fine...actually.

They're silent for a couple beats. Becca nods a little. Nat
turns and heads up the basement steps.

INT. HOWIE AND BECCA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

 

They're both in bed reading. Becca is engrossed in Jason's
comic book. Howie glances over, a bit annoyed by it.

We see a panel - the boy in the story is running from an army
of armor-clad knights.
83.

He passes through a portal, and in the next panel he's
falling through another rabbit hole. He lands on a suburban
block. The thought-bubble over the boy's head reads,
"There's my house! I'm back home!"

We follow Becca’s eye across the panels. We see the boy at
the front door of the house, and the parents staring down at
him confused. The bubble over the boy’s head reads, “It’s
me! Your son!” And the mother’s bubble reads, “But we don’t
have a son.”

The next panel: a close-up of the boy’s devastated face. And
in the next panel, he asks them, “Would you like one?”

Becca lets out a little gasp when she sees the picture.
Howie looks over, intrigued. But she doesn’t explain.
EXT. GABBY'S HOUSE- DAY
Gabby walks to answer the phone.
GABBY
Hello?
INT. HOWIE'S OFFICE —- MANHATTAN - INTERCUT PHONE CALL
HOWIE
Hey, it's Howie. Howie Corbett.
From Group?

Gabby is obviously taken aback.

GABBY
Hi, Howie.

EXT. YARD — LATE AFTERNOON

Taz is barking and jumping as Howie makes his way to the dog
house. Howie places the food down, and Taz attacks it.

Howie turns back to the house, and sees Becca working in the
garden. She's looking at him strangely.

HOWIE
Hey.

BECCA
Hi. You're going to group tonight,
right?
84.

HOWIE
(tries to sound off-hand)
Yeah. You didn't want to come, did
you?

BECCA
No.

Howie tries to not look relieved. Becca looks a little
guilty, as if she might have a secret as well.

HOWIE
I'm just gonna hop in the shower.

BECCA
Okay.

He gives a little wave, and heads in. Becca watches him go.
EXT. BECCA AND HOWIE'S FRONT OF HOUSE - MINUTES LATER

Howie, freshly showered and changed, heads for his car. One
guilty look over his shoulder, and he gets in.

INT. LIVING ROOM / FOYER - CONTINUOUS

Becca watches from behind a curtain as Howie's car pulls
away. As soon as it does, she grabs the "Rabbit Hole" comic
book and her car keys, and heads for the kitchen.

EXT. BECCA AND HOWIE'S DRIVEWAY - A MOMENT LATER

Now Becca pulls out of the driveway, and drives off in the
opposite direction.

As they drive down various suburban roads, we intercut
between the two cars. Becca and Howie are both nervous, and
eager to get where they're going.

INT. BECCA’S CAR — DUSK

Becca places the comic book up on the dashboard.

INT. HOWIE'S CAR — DUSK

Howie checks his teeth in the rearview mirror.
85.

INT. BECCA'S CAR — INTERCUT

Becca is on her cell phone. We hear Jason’s voice on the
outgoing message. Becca hangs up before it’s finished.

INT. HOWIE'S CAR - OUTSIDE GABBY'S HOUSE - INTERCUT

Howie finally reaches his destination. It's a beautiful
house on a nice block. He slows to a stop at the curb. He
puts the car into park.

He looks up at the house, and takes a deep breath. He's
terrified. He doesn't move. He just sits in his car.

EXT. GABBY'S HOUSE

Finally, he can't bear it anymore. He opens the car door,
and gets out. He smooths his shirt, and heads up the walk-
way toward Gabby's front door. It's just a few yards, but
the walk may as well be a hundred miles.

The door opens, and Gabby steps outside. She looks pretty.

GABBY
Did you find the house okay?

Howie doesn't respond. He doesn't even move.

GABBY
Howie?

Is he going to go through with this?
INT. BECCA'S CAR - INTERCUT

She pulls up Jason's block, and can't help smiling. She's
grown to enjoy these encounters with him.

But as she gets closer, her smile fades. She's really not
expecting to see the scene in front of her.

EXT. TREE-LINED STREET - OUTSIDE JASON'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Becca stops the car a safe distance away, unnoticed by
anyone. There's a limo parked at the bottom of the driveway.
Becca watches as Jason, in a tuxedo, very self-consciously
pins a corsage to a SKINNY GIRL in a prom dress.
86.

JASON'S MOTHER, giddy with pride, takes picture after
picture. JASON'S BUDDY and his BUDDY'S DATE heckle them from
inside the car.

When it's time to go, Jason and his date, move to squeeze in
the back seat. Lots of good-natured shoving, and big dresses
flipping up, and laughing.

Jason's mother, laughing herself, captures it all on film.

INT. BECCA'’S CAR — CONTINUOUS

It's a relatively benign scene, but Becca watches it as
someone might watch a car-wreck - stunned, confused, a little
disbelieving...

The limo doors close, and as it's about to drive off...
...something huge and uncontrollable opens up inside of
Becca, and she begins to cry. A lot. She clutches the
steering wheel and pretty much loses it.

EXT. BECCA'S FRONT LAWN - DAY - FLASHBACK (SLO-MO)

Jason, at the wheel of his car, terror in his eyes, turns to
see Becca standing outside of her house, trembling, not
comprehending at all what she sees. They lock eyes.

Though Becca has just seen the body of Danny, we never do.
We only see Becca and Jason in this moment. And then...

INT. LIMO — SIMULTANEOUS (SLO-MO

Still laughing, Jason turns for just a moment and sees
Becca's car as they roll by. Becca is hysterical but silent
behind the glass of her windows. Jason's smile disappears.

BACK TO THE LIMO (SLO-MO

Jason watches as Becca and her car disappear behind him, and
he continues on to his prom.

BACK TO HOWIE OUTSIDE GABBY'S HOUSE

 

Howie is still standing there. Gabby is waiting. She tries
to smile. Howie takes a step back.
87.

HOWIE
(barely a whisper)
I'm sorry.

Howie turns, and heads for the car. He gets back in. Gabby
watches as he starts the car and pulls away.

When he's gone, her shoulders drop in defeat. She slips
inside, and gently closes the door behind her.

INT. HOWIE'S CAR — SPEEDING HOME - MOMENTS LATER

 

Howie is suddenly in a big hurry to get home. He flies
through the suburban back roads, determined, and terrified of

the very big mistake he very nearly made.

EXT. HOWIE AND BECCA’S FRONT OF HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

 

Howie gets out of the car, and yanks the back door open. He
grabs the booster from the back seat, and tosses it in the
bags of garbage that have been put on the curb for pick-up.
He closes the car door, and heads into the house.

INT. BECCA AND HOWIE'S FOYER - A MOMENT LATER

 

Howie tosses his keys by the door, and peeks into the living
room, but there's no one here.

INT. KITCHEN - A MOMENT LATER

No sign of Becca. He peers out the kitchen window into the
backyard. Taz is asleep in the dog house.

He moves to the basement door, and listens. Nothing. He
calls down the stairs.

HOWIE
Becca?

Still, nothing. This is odd. Where did she go?

INT. STAIRWAY / UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

 

He runs upstairs, a bit of panic creeping in now.

HOWIE
Becca...?
88.

INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
He ducks his head in. No one there.
INT. DANNY'S ROOM —- CONTINUOUS

Howie clicks on the light. Of course there's no one here
either. He looks around the room. But there's nothing.
Other than the stripped bed, the room is completely empty.

And slowly, we see Howie’s determination drain out of his

body. He’s too late. Becca isn’t here. And he’s convinced
she’s actually left him.

Spent, Howie sits on the bed, staring off into space. Then
he quietly takes off his shoes, and lies back on the bed.
BACK TO BECCA IN HER CAR - STILL ACROSS FROM JASON’S HOUSE

The prom car is gone. Becca is alone now. The street is
empty again.
She finally lets go of the steering wheel. Her crying is

pretty much over. But she doesn't start the car. She just
sits there.

INT. BECCA'S CAR - EARLY THE NEXT MORNING
Becca is asleep in her car - pretty much where we left her.

There a little tap-tap-tap at her window. She wakes up,
disoriented, and sees Jason outside, still in his tuxedo.

BECCA
Jesus.

JASON
Sorry.

BECCA

What time is it?

JASON
Almost five?

BECCA
And you're just getting home?
89.

EXT. PARK — MINUTES LATER

They're back on their bench. The sun is creeping over the
fields of the park. They've been sitting here for awhile now
without saying anything.

BECCA
So how was it?

JASON
It was okay.

BECCA
Well you look nice.

JASON
Thank you.

BECCA
Was that your girlfriend?

JASON
Just a friend.

BECCA
She's pretty.

Jason looks to "Rabbit Hole" which sits on the bench between
them. Becca smiles, and picks up the comic book.

BECCA
Well, I liked this so much. It’s
beautiful.

JASON
Thanks.

BECCA
It reminded me of Orpheus and
Eurydice. Do you know that myth?

JASON
Not really.

BECCA
Eurydice dies, and Orpheus misses
her so much, that he travels to
Hades to retrieve her, but in the
end it doesn't work out.
90.

JASON
I should read it.

Becca flips through the book. Jason undoes his bow-tie.

BECCA
So, is the scientist your dad?
(off his blank look)
The scientist the boy is looking
for, is that your dad?

JASON
(beat)
No.

BECCA
I mean, is it based on him?

JASON
No. My dad was an English teacher.

BECCA
Oh. Okay. I was curious about
that part.

JASON

It's just a story.

BECCA
No, I know. I was just...

JASON
Reading into it?

BECCA
Yeah.

They sit there. A jogger runs by in silence.

BECCA
Do you think they're real?

JASON
Parallel universes?

JASON
I think it’s basic science. If
space is infinite, then everything
is possible.
91.

She smiles a little. This was the answer she was hoping for.

BECCA
So somewhere out there, there's a
version of me -- what? -- making
pancakes?

JASON
Sure.

BECCA

Or at a water park.

JASON
Wherever, yeah. Both. Laws of
probability. There are tons of
you's out there, and tons of me's.

BECCA
So this is just the sad version of
us.

JASON
(beat)
I guess.

BECCA
But there are other versions where
everything goes our way.

JASON
Assuming you believe in science.

BECCA
(beat)
Well that's a nice thought. That
somewhere out there I'm having a
good time.

Jason smiles. They look out over the fields, and the sun
peeking through the trees.

INT. DANNY'S ROOM — MORNING

Howie fell asleep on Danny's bed last night. He wakes up,
squinting at the sun coming in from the windows.

We hear the clink of mugs being taken from a cabinet, and
coffee being made. Morning sounds.
92.

It's so strikingly normal that Howie wonders for a moment if
he isn’t imagining it. And when he realizes he isn’t, a wave
of relief washes over him.

INT. KITCHEN — MOMENTS LATER

Becca is at the table, drinking her coffee, nibbling on a
piece of pastry.

Howie comes in, still sleepy, and takes in the scene. He
gets a mug, and pours himself some coffee.

Howie gets a plate, and cuts himself a piece. Then moves to
the table. They drink their coffee. After a while...

HOWIE
I thought maybe you had left.

She sees the fear in his eyes, and she feels badly for him.

BECCA
No. I didn't leave.

Howie hides his relief by reaching for the morning paper, and
leafing through its contents.

BECCA
So I was thinking we should invite
Rick and Debbie over for a cookout.

Howie looks up at her, totally perplexed.

BECCA
She's never gonna call. She thinks
I hate her. I might as well just
let her off the hook.

HOWIE
So a cookout then.

BECCA
It'll be good to see the kids. We
should get something for Emily
though. We missed her birthday.
She turned four last week.

HOWIE
Right. Okay.

Howie stares into his coffee mug.
93.

HOWIE
Danny's is coming up.
BECCA
I know.
HOWIE

That's gonna be a tough one.

BECCA
Yeah.

Howie looks up at her.

HOWIE
So the kid... Jason. Did you tell
him we didn't blame him?

BECCA
We don’t blame him.

HOWIE
No, I know, but did you let him
know that?

BECCA

I guess so.

HOWIE
(beat)
That's good.
BECCA
Look, Howie, if you want talk with
him.
HOWIE
I don't.
BECCA
Okay.

They pick at the Danish.

HOWIE
It's so quiet.
94.

BECCA
That's because I slipped Taz a
couple Ambien.

HOWIE
(smiles)
You're funny.

BECCA
You think I'm joking.

A nice moment between them. It’s been awhile since they’ve
had one.

Becca faces him - down to business now.

BECCA
So what are we gonna do?

HOWIE
About what?

BECCA
I don't know, pick something.

HOWIE
(thinks it over)
Well...We could go to Village Toys
tomorrow and pick up Candy Land for
Emily. That's probably something

she'd like.

BECCA
Okay, Candy Land. That's a start.
Then what?

HOWIE

Then we wrap it.

BECCA
Uh-huh.

HOWIE
And then we have the cookout...

Howie's voice continues over the following scenes...
95.

EXT. BECCA AND HOWIE'S BACK YARD - A FEW WEEKS LATER - DAY

 

A bright day. Howie is at the grill. Nat is blabbing away
to him. Becca is chatting with her neighbors (Peg and Pete.)

Rick and Debbie come through the back gate with EMILY, 4 and
ROBBIE, 7. Becca gets up and welcomes them.

HOWIE (V.O.)
And they'll come over, and we'll
have a couple other people so it's
not too awkward for anyone.

Debbie is still rather sheepish and apologetic when greeting
Becca. The kids make a b-line for Taz, who's tied up in the
doghouse, and happy to see them.

HOWIE (V.O.)
And to make them feel comfortable
we'll ask a bunch of questions
about what the kids have been up
to, and we'll pretend that we're
really interested.

Howie's voice continues over several more shots from the day.

Izzy, looking especially pregnant, shows up with Auggie.
She's brought some kind of pie. Becca seems both shocked and
impressed by it.

Despite the iconic suburban cookout, this should feel more
winsome than happy. The unresolved issues linger.

HOWIE (V.O.)
And then we'll wait for someone to
bring up Danny while the kids are
playing. And maybe that'll go on
for a little while.

And as he describes, we see them all sitting around having
some adult conversation as the sun goes down.

SAME — DUSK

Everyone's gone. Howie and Becca are sitting next to each
other in separate chairs looking out at the fading light over
the water. They are both lost in thought. All around them
is the wreckage of the cookout.
96.

HOWIE (V.O.)
And after that they'll go home.

Becca glances over at Taz, who is quiet and exhausted.

BECCA (V.O.)
And then what?

HOWIE (V.O.)
(beat)

I don't know. Something though.

We'll figure it out.

BECCA (V.O.)
Will we?

HOWIE (V.O.)
I think so. I think we will.

Becca looks to Howie. They both look a bit scared.

She reaches over and takes his hand...for the first time in a
very long time.

It's a simple gesture - not of resolution - but of
possibility. Howie holds on tight.

And we...

FADE OUT.

THE END
