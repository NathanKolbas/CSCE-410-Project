wood buildings alongside abandoned railroad tracks. Across the
front of one building, very taded, a sign - The Whistle Stop
Cafe. It is covered with advertising signs, some cardboard,
some tin, advertising everything possible to be bought or seen
from the li3is to the 19608. aA rusted awning hangs off Opal’s
Beauty Shop next door.

Distantly, the whistle of an approaching train.
2 BEGIN MAIN TITLES

Flowering weeds grow profusely between the ties. The rails are
rusted, the ties rotten, askew. The clatter of a train
approaching. The whistle, closer, the clatter of wheels,
louder.

3- TIGHT ON TRACKS -

As the ghost train flies by, the wiha Sweeps aside, the stean
from the engine billows down the right-of-way, the clatter is
deafening. Alarmed by the sound, the goat bolts, a flock of
birds flies out of the trees near the station.

But, there is no train, just a brown Ford LTD driving across the
barren tracks.

4 INT. CAR - Day -

TIGHT ON: EVELYN COUCH. She is a woman in her early 40's,
nervous and slightly overweight. She holds a bouquet of
flowers. Hearing a train whistle, she turns around and looks
over her right shoulder at the tracks. ED COUCH, her husband,
has heard nothing. .

Evelyn walks inte a back visitor’s lounge that is empty except
for one OLD LADY in a faded sweater with a Christmas corsage
who is at a card table working a “Last Supper" jigsaw puzzle.

Evelyn, unhappy, sits down and takes a candy bar out of her
purse. Just as she is about to take the first bite the ola
woman speaks.

NINNY

The only sound is a large Black Man in his forties, BIG GEORGE,
chopping wood. Idgie s es that this is serious.

 

BIG GEORGE
Good morning, Grady.

GRADY
Good morning, Big George.

In the background is the town of Whistle Stop, eight buildings
and the railroad tracks. It’s bustling. Grady stops at a
secluded area by the tracks.

IDGIE
What’s up?

. GRADY
(with great @ifficulty)
Aw...Somebody found Frank Bennett's
truck in the river and that goddamn
stupid deputy of mine sent it over the
wire before I even got out there.
Goddamn it!!

IDGIE
What’s gonna happen now?...

GRADY
(sitting)
Well, officially you and Big George are
under arrest for nurder.. +You’re in amy
Custody until tomorrow. I told them I’d
bring you over to Georgia first thing in
the morning...z figured that ought to
give you enough time...

IDGIE
(puzzled)
For what?

GRADY
(looking off into the distance)
Well, some people have been known to
pack up and sneak right out of town in
the middle of the night.

IDGIE
What about Big George?

GRADY
The way I figure it, if they got Big
George, they’d be satisfied. This is
serious, we're talking murder of a white
man and somebody's gonna have to pay,
but nobody wants to hang a woman.
FGT JA March 19, 1991

IDGIE
But it suit them fine to stretch some
rope around Big George’s neck. I can’t
let em do that, Grady.

GRADY
Now I know how you feel about Big
George--hell, we all do, but that’s just
the facts of life.

IDGIE
(after a while)
++I can’t do that.

Idgie watches Big George working in the distance. Grady nods as
Idgie walks over and whispers to Big George and then looks over
at Ruth who is watching from the cafe window.

11 INT. SUNROOM - SAME DAY < PRESENT

NINNY
So Idgie Threadgoode and Big George went
to jail for the murder of Frank Bennett,
but that’s a long story.

EVELYN
It sounds that way.

Evelyn goes into her purse and brings out two more candy bars
and offers Ninny one.

EVELYN
Would you like one?

NINNY
Oh, thank you honey. pid they take your
gallbladder out too?

EVELYN
No.

Evelyn stands to leave, her purse falls and she makes a gallant
gesture to catch it, but succeeds only in knocking the jigsaw
puzzle down to the floor.

EVELYN
I’m so sorry.

She starts to pick up the pieces.

NINNY
Oh, don’t worry about that, honey. I
enjoy a visit more than a puzzle.

a deck of cards)

12 EXT. THREADGOODE HOUSE - DAY = 1917

A big white house with a porch. aA handsome teenager, BUDDY
THREADGOODE, runs into the house, sporting formal wedding

attire, but carrying his coat, with his shirt tails hanging
out.

 

JULIAN (0.S.)
Come on, Buddy. Mama wants you inside.

13 INT. THREADGOODE HOUSE - DAY

NINNY (V.0.)
I remember the day we were all getting
ready for the wedding. The war had just
ended. The Great One, you know.

MAMA THREADGOODE a Sweat-looking woman, examines PAPA
THREADGOODE’s suit. He sports a large handlebar mustache.
SIPSEY, the black housekeeper, starts adjusting Papa‘s sleeve.
Sipsey’s son, Big George, is on a ladder hanging wedding
decorations. LEONA, the beautiful bride to be of 18, is being
attended to by her sisters. JULIAN, who is wearing a highly
starched suit, is leading his brothers in roughhousing. Mama
looks over her brood and sees Leona waiting to speak her piece.

MAMA
What ig-it Leona?

‘ . LEONA
Tdgie’s upstairs in her room and she
Says she won’t come out as long as she
lives.
(wails)
Oh...she’s gonna ruin my wedding, Mama.

MAMA
No she’s not, precious.

PAPA
(proudly)
Why Leona, you're going to be the most
beautiful bride in the entire state of
Alabama -- just wait and see.
FGT JA March 19, 1991

Mama goes to the bottom of the stairs. Buddy shows up, winded.

' MAMA
Imogene Louise Threadgoode. This is
your mother. You come down here right
this minute. Do you hear’ me? Buddy,
you go fetch her, she’1l listen to you.

All of a sudden, Idgie appears at the top of the stairs, where
she stands as regally as she can. All eyes focus on her.. A
huge bow is wrapped around her head and tied very badly. Her
dress is starched painfully stiff. The short skirt flares out
over many petticoats revealing Idgie’s thin legs and skinned
knees. She has on white anklets and shiny black baby doll shoes
which are new and too tight.

(sweetly)
Come on down, honey. Let’s see you.

Idgie looks at Buddy who nods encouragingly. She starts down
the stairs, holding her skirt down delicately as sh surveys her
family. A snicker escapes Julian as he hums, "I see London, I
see France etc." Buddy shoots him a look and Idgie freezes.

Julian.. Hush now.
(to Idgie)
Come ahead, sweetheart.

Idgie reaches the bottom of the stairs. We see her elbows and
legs are skinned. Leona is horrified at the sight.
LEONA
Mama!!! .

BUDDY
You look just fine, Idgie.

: JULIAN
She looks like a monkey.

Idgie runs at the mocking Julian and jumps hin, ripping her
dress in the process. Buddy pulls her off and she runs out of
the house stripping as she goes.

BUDDY
(te Julian)
T’1l get you back, boy.

14 EXT. THREADGOODE YARD

Idgie is up the tree in her underwear, sulking. Buddy climbs up
the tree with the comfort and confidence of acat. He sits next
to her. Idgie is Clearly upset. There’s a long beat as Buddy
contemplates his sister’s predicament.

after his sister. :

As the ceremony continues, Mama dabs at her eyes while Idgie
takes a small broken mirror and flashes a brilliant reflection
on Reverend Scroggin’s face. Then Idgie turns the mirror which
flashes on the cheek of a young and beautiful Ruth Jameson.
Ruth feels the light and turns in its direction and she sees
Buddy Threadgocde who eyes her with love and admiration. Mana,
without taking her eyes off the altar, takes hold of Idgie’s
arm and tries to keep her from further nischiet.

16 EXT. THREADGOODE YARD

' fhe whole town is there and everyone is congratulating Papa.

Mama is busy supervising the Party. Sipsey and Big George are
loading the tables which have been set up with food and iced
tea.

Buddy with Idgie riding on his shoulders comes through the
crowd. All the young girls look at him and smile and giggle.

BUDDY .
Now don’t you look beautiful today,
Lily.

IDGIE

Yes Lily, you look beautiful today.
Lily just blushes wildly.

NINNY (V.0.)
I don’t think there was ever a sweeter
boy than Buddy Threadgoode.

(clearing her throat)

He was a terrible flirt, but his heart
belonged to Ruth Jameson. She was a
@istant cousin of Mama’s and had come
all the way from Valdosta, Georgia that
summer to teach at the Church School.
I remember how pretty she looked that
day.

Idgie climbs down off of Buddy’s back and points out RUTH
JAMESON, early twenties, striking, with long brown hair. she
is serving some punch.

BUDDY
Ruth Jameson, you are just the one I’ve
been looking for.

He takes her hand and begins to pull her away gently.
RUTH
(pulls her hand away)
Not in public.
Scroggins gives Buddy a dirty look. Idgie looks at Scroggins
like he’s nuts. Buddy just smiles at the Reverend and slips
his arm around Ruth’s waist and starts to lead her away.

Buddy kiases Ruth passionately. She reciprocates. Her hat
falls off. Idgie looks at them from a distance, shakes her
head disparagingly and looks away.

17B EXT. TRAIN TRACKS - LATER-

Idgie swings over the tracks on a rope that dangles from a
nearby branch. Ruth hesitates and ther 8uddy holds her and
swings with her. She loves it. Her hat ralls off again.

RUTH
Oh, no!

Buddy kisses her and swings off after the hat. The train
appears behind him at the turn, approaching as the hat skins
across the tracks, and slides under the rail, the ribbons
tangling in the splintery ties. Buddy starts for the hat
Clowning as the girls watch him from the distance. He grabs
it, but gets his foot caught between two converging steel
rails. The train blows its warning whistle.

Tdgie yells for Buddy as he grabs his foot and tries to un-pry
it. To Idgie and Ruth it still looks as if he’s clowning in
the dusty windy distance. Buddy tugs and slips and he smiles
at Ruth and Idgie as we hear the brakes being applied. The
screech of metal on metal. Buddy just about has his shoe -
untied when he pulls free and stumbles on the gravel mound that
holds the railroad ties. Idgie is jolted with fear and runs to
Buddy yelling for him to get up.

heartbreaking scream of pain as she reaches Buddy. She screans
his name as if trying to bring him back to life...

The Threadgoode family is assembled. Ruth is in black and

Clearly distraught. Rev. Scroggins is speaking at the funeral
service.

NINNY (V.0.)
Oh, it like to have killed us all but
the one who took it the hardest was
Idgie. We thought she'd die right along
with him. :

Ruth looks over at Idgie who stares at her with naked contempt.
Idgie bolts from the funeral group and runs off across the
countryside. The Reverend pauses as Mama and Papa exchange
looks. Sipsey takes her hand from Big George’s arm. He nods
and heads after Idgie’s diminishing figure.

21 EXT. WOODS - DAY

Idgie running through the woods, the twigs and brush lashing her
tender skin. :

22 EXT. RIVER - NIGHT

Darkness, virtual silence. The river the only constant sound
except for the occasional lonely hoot of an owl. Silhouettes
are the only visible shapes as THE CAMERA searches for life and
finds first a fire and then the hunched shape of Big George
nearby. He gets up carrying a blanket and heads toward the
diminutive figure of Idgie shivering by the river. He drapes
the blanket over her shoulders. She nods a thanks to him and he
goes to sit by the fire. The blanket falls off of Idgie’s
shoulders, and she does not notice. Big George gets up to
repeat the gesture as the distant wail of a train echoes through
the night.

beating just the same.

up to her.

Don’t you think we should get off the

Well, sometimes I get a little dizzy

Don’t look down.

Ruth smiles politely as Idgie litts up a handful of cans and
foodstuffs and walks to the open area of the car. She starts
tossing them out the door.

RUTH
What are you doing?

IDGIE
Come look.

Ruth does not relish the idea of going so close to the edge, but
she steels herself and looks out and sees the hungry faces of
poor black families and migrant workers who are waiting
anxiously for Idgie’s gifts,

IDGIE
You talk about give unto others.

RUTH
Yes, but this food isn’t yours to give.

IDGIE
That’s Church talk. Well, I’ve seen
those same people who are on their knees

Idgie throws out an armful of food as the children scurry for it
and some of the men shout "Thanks Railroad Bill."

IDGIE
Come on. Help!

Ruth is ina quandary, but one more look at those hungry faces
outside and Ruth begins to help too.

Ruth jumps and an impressed Tdgie follows suit. They both hit
the ground and roll. Ruth dusts herself off, gets up and walks
toward the tracks to head back home, when she notices that
Idgie isn’t moving very much. In fact, she’s very much in
pain.

RUTH

IDGIE
I’m fine.

She tries to stand and crumples in pain to the ground.

off and return to their hives. When she gets back to Ruth,
there are only a half-dozen bees left in her hair.

IDGIE

Well, Grady, tell you what. The next
time those "some People" come in here,
I’1l ask ’em if they don’t want anybody
to know who they are under those sheets,
when they go marching around in one of
those stupid parades you boys have, why
don’t they have enough sense to change
their shoes?

GRADY
(upset)
Now wait a minute, Idgie.

IDGIE
Oh hell, Grady, y’all ain't fooling
anybody. Why, I’d recognize those size
fourteen clodhoppers you got anywhere.

Grady looks down at his feet. Ruth re-enters and joins then,
giving Grady a disarming smile.

Would you like some more pie, Grady?

No thanks, Ruth. . .

from shaving. He sits down and Ruth serves him a feast .
consisting of fried chicken, black-eyed peas, turnip greens,
fried green tomatoes, cornbread and iced tea. ‘Smokey is
overwhelmed. He looks at Ruth likes she’s the (real) Madonna.

BIG GEORGE
You gonna get yourself in a whole bunch
of trouble.

IDGIE

He’s harmless. When his own daddy died,
he didn’t shed one tear, but when he
found out the old colored man who raised
him had passed away, he got drunk and
sat down at the river for three days
crying like a baby. Remember, Sipsey?

~ dreamt that Buddy was gone. I woke up,
ran to his crib and there he was,
sleeping like an angel. I prayed and
thanked God for Buddy. I remembered
having the same reaction after Frank

giving me the strength to take it. And
I remembered thanking the Lord for each
day my mother lived even when she was
spitting up blood and crying for me to
kill her... I looked at my mother’s
eyes pleading with me to help her and
all I could do was pray.

When you were gone, as I was holding
Buddy I thought, if that bastard Frank
Bennett ever tries to take my child
away, I won’t pray, I’11 kill hin.

wheel tighten and her eyes harden with the resolve of...

Evelyn guns her car and swings the wheel and smashes into the
back of the surprised VW. A fender crumples. Evelyn backs up
and then smashes into the car again. The bumper drops off, two
hubcaps fly. The girls look back, stunned as Evelyn plows into
the VW again, harder. The whole back end is crumbled now. The
back window splinters. One of the girls runs towards the market
yelling.

Help! Someone...

The other Girl grabs her arm and yanks her toward the cars.
Evelyn’s arms are rigid, eyes narrowed, she stomps on the gas.
Her car leaps forward. On impact, there is a trace of a smile
on her face. The Girls arrive, frantic, banging on the top of

No dinner either?

EVELYN
Ed, do you ever wonder why I’ve been
going to so many classes for all these

Ninny is asleep in her room, her dress inside out, the sun
washing out what little color she has. She looks transparent.
Evelyn is holding a gift and stops in the doorway, realizing
suddenly how old her friend is. Evelyn enters the room and
studies the wall by Ninny’s bed. It’s full of pictures of
sweetheart roses that have been cut out of magazines. Ninny

opens her eyes, smiling, pats her hair, gathers herself
together.

 

NINNY
Oh, Evelyn, hello, do you like my
roses? Since I can’t get home to see
my own roses, I made myself a paper
garden. Got everything but the bugs.

EVELYN
They’re lovely.

made me fried green tomatoes.
(she tastes one)
They’re delicious.

EVELYN
It’s your recipe. Are they cold?

NINNY

No, they’re just the way we used to eat
them at the cafe. You couldn’t be
sweeter to me if you were my own
daughter. You know, I don’t feel
eighty-three. It just sorta slipped up
on me. One day it seemed I was a young
woman running around and the next day I
was just full of liver spots and
walking like molasses going up hill in
winter.

I just. never thought I would live this
long. Of course, the Lord takes us

I was just thinking about Ruth.

142 EXT. WHISTLE STOP CAFE - DAY - 1939

The cafe is closed. A sign out front says "Closed due to

echoing the sentiment of the sign.

After the trial was over, everything
went back to normal until that Spring
when Ruth lost her appetite and when
Dec Hadley looked at her, he said the

Two beers, right away.

Idgie is drinking both beers. Stump is watching her drink.
She is holding a baseball on her lap.

IDGIE
Did you get into a fight?

 

STUMP
I got punched in thi ose. I can’t
Play like everyone else.

IDGIE
Did I ever tell you the story about the
oysters, all the millions of then just
lying around?

STUMP
And God puts sand in one and then it
makes a pearl?

IDGIE
Oh... Did I ever tell you about Eva’s
three legged dog?

STUMP
How it never felt sorry for itself and
how I ought to be smarter than a dumb

STUMP
She‘’s sick.

IDGIE
Well now’s a time for courage, like the
time Big George. Did I ever tell you...

STUMP
When he saved you from the wild hogs?

IDGIE
They weren’t wild, but they were hogs
and he was brave. (beat) Then you
probably know that there are angels
masquerading as people and walking this
planet and your mom is the bravest one
of those.

Stump chokes up a. little then nods and then puts his arm around
Tdgie’s neck, nestling her and trying not to cry.

IDGIE
So what do you say that you and I
practice some hitting?

STUMP
I’d like that.

145 INT. RUTH’S ROOM - DAY

Buddy runs into the room. Ruth opens her eyes and smiles
weakly.

BUDDY
Mama, I can hit. You should see me.
And Aunt Idgie hit me in the back with a
curve ball but I didn’t duck and I
hardly cried.

RUTH
She hit you?
(gives Idgie a look)
Well she did that to me once, too, but I
think I did ery.

BUDDY
Mama, I’m sorry if you’re sad.

RUTH
Give me a big kiss and I’11 never be sad
again.

Buddy kisses her. A pause.

RUTH
»+eAnd don’t you be sad either, promise?

BUDDY
Promise.

He line out of the room. She winces in pain.

RUTH
Sipsey. . .

SIPSEY
Hold on, honey. I’m here. Don’t you
worry.

Sipsey holds up the needle in the sunlight, filling it full.

SIPSEY
No ma’am, my Jesus is a sweet Jesus. He
never meant for one of his babies to
suffer so. No ma’an.

Idgie can’t watch. She goes to the window and sees a group of
black men and women standing on the front lawn.

Idgie sits on Ruth’s bed. Ruth opens her eyes. There is a long

silence. Seeing the heartbreak in Idgie’s eyes, Ruth tries to

make it easier.
IDGIE

Are you sure you don’t want me to read

you anything?

RUTH
Yes. Will you do one thing for me?

IDGIE
What?

RUTH
Be good to yourself, even settle down if
you find someone who can beat you in
poker.

Idgie can’t take it and has to walk away from Ruth.

IDGIE
Ruth, there are so many things I should
to tell you.

RUTH
The past is past. (beat) I love your
stories. ...Tell me a story Idgie...
FGT JA March 19, 1991 97

Idgie tries to speak, but for the first time since anyone’s
known her, nothing comes out. Ruth can’t help but notice and
loses her composure a little as she sees tears forming in
Idgie’s eyes. ‘ .
RUTH
come on you old bee charmer, tell me a
good tall tale.

Idgie tries again, but can’t pull herself together.

RUTH
Tell me about the lake.

IDGIE
What lake?

RUTH

The one that used to be here.

IDGIE
Oh...that was nothing but a lie.

RUTH
(smiles)
I know, but tell me anyway.

Ruth closes her eyes. Idgie stares at her for a moment.

RUTH
Tell me the story.

IDGIE

(with great difficulty)
Well..one time there was this great big
ol’ lake right outside of town.

(pause)
Oh, we used to swim and fish and go
canoeing in it and then one day in
November, this big flock of ducks, oh
about forty or more landed right smack
in the middle of that lake and while
they were sitting there the temperature
dropped so fast the whole lake froze.

There is singing from outside.

IDGIE
...And the next thing we knew, they’d
flown off, and to this day that lake is
somewhere over in Georgia.

Idgie sobs and puts her head down on the side of the bed still
holding Ruth’s hand. Sipsey walks in and looks at Idgie and
Ruth. She quietly stops the clock and covers the mirror with a
shawl. She goes over to Idgie, who is still sobbing like her
heart will break.

146 EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

Ruth is being buried. A large crowd is present. Scroggins is
preaching. Idgie and Stump aren’t present. Csmera pans and
pans and pans until we find them in a neighboriny field,
tossing a baseball back and forth, Ruth’s request satisfied.

147 EXT. ROSE HILLS NURSING HOME - FALL DAY - PRESENT

Evelyn and Ninny are sitting on the porch; tears are streaming
down Evelyn’s face.

A flock of birds fly by in the fall sky. Ninny shades her eyes
and looks up and watches them fade into the horizon.

NINNY V.0.
It’s funny how strong Ruth affected
everyone. Even Smokey Lonesome. When
he died a few years back, he had one
possession on him, a picture of Ruth.
I think it was the only thing Smokey
ever stole. He was in love with her
from the first time he saw her. Oh
look at the birds... I shouldn’t have
told you this.

EVELYN
I hate death. It scares me so.

NINNY
(holding her hand)
I wouldn't be so frightened of death if
I were you, I’d be more scared driving
in rush hour traffic.

148 EXT. U. OF ALABAMA - GRADUATION EXERCISES ~- 1953

THE CAMERA TRACKS slowly past very polished and highly
fashionable dr shoes. A pair of black wing tips, then white
pumps, black dress shoes, then white pumps, and so forth as we
hear off screen the names of the graduates being announced.

THE CAMERA arrives at stockinged bare feet with shoes nearby
leaning on one another. THE CAMERA TRACKS up the leg revealing
a run in the stocking until a white dress comes in view and
finally Idgie in a large hat, seated, trying not to fidget.

 

THE CAMERA PULLS BACK revealing Grady next to her with Cleo and
Sipsey and Big George, Dr. Hadley and his daughter Peggy, and
last but not least, Eva Bates and Rev. Scroggins. our group is
somewhat incongruous with the suits that surround then.

Stump opens the box and takes out a beautiful gold watch.

BUDDY
Thanks, Aunt Idgie.
IDGIE
It’s not from me, Buddy. Look on the

He turns it over. The inscription reads simply: "I love you,

hugs her.

IDGIE
Your mom would have been very proud.

BUDDY
I wish she could have been here.

IDGIE
She is.
(trying to lighten the mood)
Run on, son. You and Peggy go be with
your friends.

Idgie watches him leave, hand in hand with Peggy. She starts to
walk down the grass to a secluded spot, when Grady comes over.

GRADY
Hard to believe he’s a grown man now,
ready to get married.

IDGIE
Yeah.

Idgie starts to take off her stockings while she is walking,
hopping on one foot with a grace that only Idgie possesses.

opens the note and reads its) "77i7 always love you, the
beecharner." Evelyn sniles to herself and then notices Ninn

walking out of the cemetery towards the town of Whistle Stop.
Evelyn impulsively cries out:

EVELYN
Idgie?

Ninny instinctively turns her head and smiles at Evelyn, who
shakes her head for a second and then Scurries after her. From
the distance we can see Evelyn approach Ninny.

EVELYN
Tdgie’s still alive?

NINNY
Yes.

EVELYN
Why didn’t you tell me?

NINNY
You didn’t ask. she’s out there
sonewhere Tunning tree, charming bees
and selling honey. Every once in
awhile, I/11 catch a hint of her.
Maybe we/11 see her one day scon.

EVELYN
Oh. . . You've been holding out on nme,
haven’t you? Let/s go home and then
you’ll have to tell me everything.

Arm in arm they walk through the Gilapidated remains of the
town of Whistle Stop. Evelyn starts asking Ninny all the
questions that now come to her mind about Idgie’s life. THE

voices from the Past echo through this repository of memories
until we again hear the ghost train’s whistle and the clatter
of its wheels as it approaches the town. The red leaves of
fall start blowing in the wind as the train noise crescendoes.
And again no train actually appears.

down, everybody just scattered to the
winds. It was never more than just a
little knockabout Place, but now that 1
look back on it, when that care closed,
the heart of the town just stopped
beating, It is funny how a little
Place like this brought so many people
together.
