OPENING CREDITS ROLL AS WE FADE IN ON:
EXT. CHICAGO SKYLINE - SWEEPING AERIAL VIEW - DAY -

The city is gorgeous, shimmering under the early summer sun. Lake
Michigan sparkles. Soldier Field lends a flash of color. The Sears
Tower adds a touch of grandeur .

As the CAMERA descends, we see movement -- millions of people on
their lunch hour. Finally, on the steps of thé Art Museum, we see
one cog in the machine who seems to be motionless, deep in
thought.

EXT. ART MUSEUM - DAY

sitting next to one of the famous lions is SARAH RUSSELL -- 24
years-old and “girl next door" pretty. With dark smudges of
fatigue under her eyes, she resembles a delicate china doll up
past her bedtime.

She seems to be concentrating on the traffic at this busy
intersection. The remains of a half-eaten sack lunch are beside
her.

SARAH (V.0.)
If I had to choose one word to .
describe my life, it would have to
be "random". Events don't happen in
a logical progression. No rhyme. No
reason.

Sarah stands. She walks down the last two steps, throws her trash
away and strides down the street.

EXT. MARSHALL FIELDS - DAY

Sarah enters the imposing Art Deco building with tastefully-
arranged window displays.

INT. MARSHALL FIELDS

As she walks past various counters, people smile and wave at her.
Friendly, but not too friendly.

SARAH (V.0.)
In fact, I thrive on the surprises

life seems determined to keep

throwing at me. For instance, though

I graduated from the University of
Chicago at the top of my class, I
didn't make it into Harvard Med school.
Two years later, I'm an assistant buyer
at Marshall Fields. And I don't even
like to shop.
She enters an office and takes a seat at one of the many
identically-functional desks. She does paperwork as people begin
to trickle back from lunch.

Sarah smiles as various employees greet her, but no one engages
her in conversation.

SARAH (V.0.)
I don’t have any friends. Well,
not really.

CUT TO:
INT. SARAH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

An open plan apartment with hardwood floors -- the living room,
kitchen and dining room all share the same space.

A too-hip woman with brilliant curly red hair plays a keyboard.
The volume is way up. Her name is CARLA.

SARAH (V.0.).
Even my roommate and I. We have
more of a truce than a friendship.

Sarah comes padding out of a room in her pajamas, squinting and
rubbing her eyes.

CARLA
Too loud?

Though the words imply she may be sorry, the tone implies she also
wouldn't mind starting a fight.

SARAH
Getting some water.

As Sarah fills a glass at the sink, Carla turns the volume up a
notch. Sarah glances at a clock on the wall. It's 1:30 AM.

SARAH (V.0.)

Carla wonders why I never say
anything. Most people would kill
for a roommate like me. I think
she assumes I'm scolding her for
being too loud by being too quiet.

Sarah pads back to her bedroom as Carla digs into a spectacular
solo.

cur To:
INT. MARSHALL FIELDS - MARTINE'S OFFICE - DAY

MARTINE, Sarah's boss and the very picture of chic sits in a plush
chair watching six-foot-tall models come and go in forma] dresses.
Sarah sits beside Martine, taking notes on her decisions.

A Chilean designer named RODRIGO stands nearby giving the details
on each outfit. An ASSISTANT runs up and whispers in Rodrigo's
ear. He is annoyed by the news.

RODRIGO
(apologetically,
to Martine)

My Mimi... she has sickness.

Rodrigo eyes Sarah speculatively. So does Martine. Sarah cringes.
cur TO:
ON THE MOCK STAGE:

Sarah is dressed in a flippy faux-leopard skin coat, cream
leggings and knee-high brown suede boots. Other models wear fur
jackets, wool coats and lycra ski-wear.

SARAH (V.O.)
Martine does not realize how much
this humiliates me. She thinks I
get a thrill from playing a poor
man's Cindy Crawford.

But, Sarah seems resigned to her newest job requirement. At
Martine's urging, she adds a slight burlesque swing to her walk.
Martine LAUGHS and applauds.

SARAH (V.O.)
Fur coats in May. It's a twisted
business.

Getting into it, Sarah twirls so the coat swings around Marlo
Thomas-style. Suddenly, without warning, mid-twirl even, Sarah
collapses to the stage. Unconscious. Martine runs up to her.

MARTINE
Sarah?!

Martine dials "911" on her cell phone. Rodrigo tsk tsk's.
RODRIGO

(disapproving)
so unprofessional.
4.

Rodrigo comforts the other models, who run to his protective arms
as if unconsciousness were contagious.

cur To:
OVER BLACKNESS:

“SARAH (V.0O.)

My mother has an inexplicable fear
of doctors. She has never been in
a serious accident or hospitalized
for anything except the birth of
her children. Perhaps, it‘s the fear
of knowing what's wrong and having
to face it.

(beat) :
Whether it's hereditary or psycho-
logical, I have inherited this fear.

END CREDIT SEQUENCE:
INT. CHICAGO MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - SARAH'S ROOM - DAY

Sarah wakes up in a sterile gray room, in a stiff white bed,
—_ surrounded by all that medical stuff.

SARAH (V.O.)
And it doesn't matter that I want
to become one, I still don't like
waking up.in a hospital bed face-
to-face with--

DR. GORDON
I'm Dr. Gordon.

A slightly-balding doctor in his mid-40's, DR. GORDON, looks up
briefly from a chart when he hears her stir.

Sarah struggles to sit up.
SARAH
(hoarse)
Can I go now?
Sarah is surprised at how cracked and weak her voice sounds.

Slipping into the role of able person to her helpless patient, Dr.
Gordon pours her a glass of water.

o~ . DOCTOR GORDON
No, Sarah, I'm afraid we need you
to stay while we run a few tests.
SARAH (V.O.)
And run a few tubes up my nose and
stick an I.V. in my hand...

Sarah looks down and sees the needle already in her hand.

SARAH
(laughing to
herself)
Too late.
(beat)
Look, I got dizzy and passed out.
Since when does that call for tests?

DOCTOR GORDON
That doesn't. It's the 14 hours you
spent unconscious afterwards.

SARAH (V.0.)
Now this is news.

- DOCTOR GORDON

It‘*s a sign the body's dealing with

something. If we can identify that

something perhaps we can help your

body deal with it.
Sarah lies back dejectedly.

CUT TO:

A MONTAGE of evil-looking tests being run ...

- An extremely cold-looking CAT-Scan machine swallows Sarah
like a cat devouring a tasty bird.

- More blood is taken from an already pale Sarah.

- Probes are placed on and in every part of Sarah's defenseless
body. Even though you don't know Sarah very well yet ... you
gotta sympathize.

cut TO:

INT. SARAH'S HOSPITAL ROOM - EVENING

Sarah sits up in her bed. Physically, she looks better, but

judging from the shocked look on her face, she's just gotten some

bad news.

. SARAH
Leukemia?

Dr. Gordon speaks seriously but soothingly.
DR. GORDON
(nodding)
Acute myeloginous.
(quickly )
It's not as bad as it sounds, Sarah.

‘SARAH
(sarcastic) .
I didn't mean to jump:'to conclusions.
Please tell me the positive side of
having cancer.

DR. GORDON
Sarah, I know it all sounds pretty
grim, but we have very effective
treatment programs. Many people go
into remission and continue to live
full healthy lives ...

Dr. Gordon's voice drones on, but Sarah isn't listening anymore.
Her eyes stray to the clothes hanging in her closet. The
ridiculous leopard-skin coat, leggings and boots.

SARAH (V.0.)
I want to go home.

cur TO:
INT. KANKAKEE - 7-11 PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT

Sarah, dressed in the leopard-skin coat, tights and boots, is
making a call. Tourists in shorts and t-shirts stare at her
curiously as they buy their Snapple and Cheetoes. It‘s 85°.

SARAH
(into phone)
Just call me at home if anything
urgent comes up.

Sarah moves to hang up, then glances at the hospital bracelet
still encircling her wrist. She tries to pull it off, but it isn't
budging.

SARAH
(cont. )
Carla? Yeah. If a Doctor Gordon
calls, you don't know where I am.

Sarah hangs up. After a moment, she picks the phone back up, drops
coins in, dials another number and waits as the line RINGS and
RINGS. Finally, a machine picks up on the other end and the BEEP
is heard. Sarah hesitates, uncertain ... then finally speaks.
SARAK
(faltering)
Mom, dad, it's Sarah ...
(long pause)
I'm coming home for a visit. I should
get in around 7:00 tomorrow morning.

INT. 7-11 - NIGHT

Sarah stands in line, waiting to check out. She bites.an incision
in the bracelet and finally tears it off.

SARAH (V.O.)
I'm not going home for the reasons
you might think: love, comfort,
parental support. I've always been
kind of ... self-sufficient.

Sarah walks up to the counter and puts down a l-liter Mountain
Dew. The teenage CLERK stares curiously at her outlandish outfit
and the ripped hospital bracelet as he rings up her purchase.

cur TO:
INT. SARAH'S CAR - NIGHT

Sarah is obviously exhausted as she drives down the almost-
deserted highway. She drinks her Mountain Dew and has Smashing
Pumpkins cranked as loud as her speakers will allow.

SARAH (V.O.)
You might think the fact that I
happen to be one of the 25,000
adults diagnosed with leukemia
annually would support my random
theory, but for once it appears
cosmic justice has caught up with
me. Because, as it happens, I
deserve to die.

(beat)

But, that's just not the kind of
message you leave on your parents’
answering machine.

she passes a cop that has pulled someone over. Instinctively, she
taps the brakes.

SARAH (V.0.)
Why do I slow down? I don't know.
It's not like the cop is going to
throw down his ticket pad and come
after me. (MORE)
SARAH (V.O., CONT. }
(beat) .
Even if he did, I now have the
perfect excuse: I'm dying and I've
got to hurry up and do some shit.

pulsing beat or no, Sarah's eyelids are drooping.

ON FLASHING RED LIGHT MATCH CUT TO:
FLASHBACK - THE OPENING CREDITS OF “THE A-TEAM" OW A TV SCREEN
INT. LIVING ROOM

Two little boys -- JON and RICKY -- avidly watch Mr. T and the
rest of his vigilante gang wreak havoc in the name of justice. For
no particular reason, Jon shoves Ricky. Ricky shoves back. It's a
free for all.

JON/RICKY
(péak volume)
Saraht

INT. KITCHEN

In the kitchen, a gawky 12-year-old Sarah makes popcorn at the
stove. An adorable one-year-old, JENNIFER, watches curiously from
her walker. Jon and Ricky can be heard yelling at each other.

SARAH
(yelling)
Guys! Truce now or the tv goes off
and the pajamas go on!

The sound of the two boys fighting in the living room grows to a
deafening pitch. Sarah looks at Jennifer and raises her eyebrows.

SARAB

You're much too good to be related

to those two.
Jennifer smiles in response. As soon as the POPS issuing from the
covered pot subside, Sarah turns off the burner and sets the pot
on the counter. Jennifer can’t take her eyes off the popcorn.
Sarah pushes Jennifer's walker into the living room.
INT. LIVING ROOM

Sarah has to step in and physically separate the brawling
brothers.

SARAH
Okay, what's the problem?
JON
He started it.

RICKY
You hit me, jerkwad.

unnoticed, Jennifer starts to scoot back toward the kitchen.

JON
your fat head was in my way.

Jon tries to get at Ricky again, but Sarah holds them apart.

SARAH
I'd hate to have to throw all that
popcorn away.

Jon and Ricky eye each other, pondering a truce borne out of
mutual hunger. Suddenly, Sarah looks around.

SARAH
Where's Jennifer?

And then she hears a strange NOISE as of something THUMPING
against something else. It builds and turns into a horrible
GRATING SOUND.

CUT TO:
INT. SARAH'S CAR - DAWN

The GRATING SOUND is Sarah's car SCRAPING against the guard rail
on the right side of the road. She fell asleep.

Waking and panicking, she overcompensates and swerves left across
two lanes and onto the grassy median, where she slams on her
brakes. Luckily, the road is deserted.

Sarah's face is streaked with tears. She buries her head in her
hands.

Slowly, she looks up and is taken aback by the subtle beauty of a
Midwest sunrise ... the palest lavenders, pinks and grays streaked
with wispy clouds.
How could anything be wrong on a day like this?

cut TO:
EXT. STANTON, ILLINOIS - RAY'S SUNOCO - EARLY MORNING

The sun is a little higher in the sky when Sarah pulls into this
filling station.
10.

BUDDY CARROLL, a a good-looking 21-year-old, walks over and eyes the
scrape along the passenger side of the car.

BUDDY
You know, I could take care of
that-- .

He walks around the car and bends down to the driver's side window
as Sarah, not looking, opens the door. The window frame CRACKS
against his head and he falls to the ground.

SARAH
Ohmigod, I'm sorry.
(helping him up)
Are you okay?

Reeling like a punch-drunk fighter, he blinks his eyes as he looks
up at her. The sun is behind her and he only sees an angelic
silhouette.

. BUDDY
Sarah?
SARAH
(incredulous)
Buddy?
BUDDY

It's Henry now.

He points to the namepatch on his chambray workshirt to prove it.
Sure enough, it says "Henry". .

Sarah helps him up and seems amazed when he towers over her at
over six feet tall.

SARAH
You're so ... big.

BUDDY
‘s been six years ... you know, I
drink milk.

Buddy can't believe he said that. These two speak in the shorthand
of people who have known each other all their lives, but the
undercurrent is strange ... almost embarrassed.

SARAH
I'm sorry. I'm so used to self-
serve.

BUDDY

I*ll get it.
11.

Buddy and Sarah surreptiziously size each other up as he pumps
gas.

INT. RAY'S SUNOCO /
Buddy leads Sarah in. He rings up the gas.

BUDDY
That'll be twelve even.

Sarah hands him a credit card and he shakes his head
apologetically.

BUDDY
Sorry, Sarah. Cash only.

Buddy is staring at her bizarre coat. Sarah notices, but doesn't
offer an explanation.

SARAH
Forget where I am.
(smiles)
You know you're the only gas station
on earth that doesn't take credit
cards.

BUDDY
Talk to my dad. Progress marched on
and left him in the dust.

SARAH
How's he doin'?

Sarah's catches herself with a grimace. She's been home for ten
minutes and is already picking up the native drawl she worked so
hard to get rid of.

BUDDY
Good ... good.

Sarah hands him a twenty. Buddy nods toward her car as he makes
change.

BUDDY
I-I was saying before, I can give
you a good deal on a little body
work.

Sarah smiles at his words.
SARAH

Now there's an offer I don't get
every day.
12.

Buddy shakes his head, embarrassed.

BUDDY
The scrape ..- on your car.
SARAH
Ohhh. Thanks. I‘11 think about it.
BUDDY"
How's Daniel doing?
SARAH
I was gonna ask you.
BUDDY
Oh, I've seen him home on breaks,
but we don't ... you know ... hang
out that much. We're both really

busy.
Sarah is walking out. Buddy speaks up before he loses his nerve.

BUDDY
Hey would you maybe want to go see
a movie sometime?

SARAH
I really don't think I'm gonna be
home long, Buddy, but thanks ...

There is an awkward beat as Sarah hesitates before leaving.
SARAS
(cont. )
It's good to see you.

BUDDY
Yeah. Same here.

Then she's gone. Buddy watches her get in her car and head for
town. He couldn't take his eyes off her if he tried.

BUDDY

(to himself)
I drink milk? Idiot.

INT. SARAH'S CAR

Sarah drives through the almost-deserted Main Street then turns
onto a residential street.

 
13.

EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET

Two WOMEN in their 50's dressed in hideous sweatsuits are
racewalking. Their breathing is labored and they seem near
collapse. They stop to watch Sarah's car pass.

WOMAN 1
wonder what could bring her home.

WOMAN '2 .
Trouble, most likely.

The two women try to shrug it off, but their curiosity is as
tangible as their fatigue. .

FURTHER DOWN THE STREET ..-

Sarah pulls into the driveway of a red-brick house. She gets out
and.walks inside through a side screen door.

EXT. MORRISEY HOUSE

Across the street, a WOMAN watches Sarah enter the house.

In her mid-40's, LORRAINE MORRISEY is just starting to go gray.

Though her eyes are cold, a vague afterimage of the attractive

woman she once was persists.

She stares at the door Sarah went through for a few moments. Then

she picks up her clippers and goes back to pruning her spectacular

rose bushes, fixating on the roses as she clips methodically.
MATCH CUT TO FLASHBACK:

The same roses bathed in the shadows of ...

Night. Flashing lights. Urgent but unintelligible VOICES. The
CLANG of metal against metal.

A BEVY OF EMT‘s TRAMPLE the rosebushes as they run past, pulling a
stretcher.

EXT. MORRISEY HOUSE - NIGHT

A younger Lorraine and her husband, HOWARD, arrive home to find an
ambulance and police car parked in front of the house.

A few NEIGHBORS mill about the front yard, speculating what the
trouble might be. They stop whispering and turn to stare when they
see Lorraine approaching. She eyes them back, terrified.
14.

LORRAINE
(to crowd)
What are you looking at?

A ghostly male voice OVERLAPS her own at this question.

SMASH CUT TO:
INT. MORRISEY HOUSE - BATHROOM - MORNING - PRESENT
Lorraine is washing the dirt from her hands and staring in the
mirror above the sink, mesmerized. Her husband, Howard, watches
her for a moment before repeating his question. He has kind eyes
and a patient smile.

HOWARD .
Lorraine, what are you looking at?

Lorraine snaps out of it with a start. She seems surprised to find
herself in the bathroom, but recovers quickly.

LORRAINE
(isn't it obvious?)
The mirror.
She walks out, leaving him staring after her from the doorway.
INT. MORRISEY HOUSE ~ KITCHEN

Lorraine walks into the kitchen and pours a cup of coffee. Howard
follows, sits at the table and glances at the newspaper.

LORRAINE
The Russell girl is home.

Howard looks up, surprised and cautious. He tries a light-hearted
tone.

HOWARD
Which one?

Lorraine sits down across from her husband and makes it clear
she’s not amused.

LORRAINE
The only one.

HOWARD
So ... Sarah's home.

He looks at her over the top of his paper. She avoids his eyes and
drinks her coffee.

15.

INT. RUSSELL HOUSE - MORNING

Sarah hears voices talking excitedly in the kitchen as she walks
in the doorway.

SARAH
Hello?

The voices abruptly stop. Sarah pauses, a little confused, then
walks into ...

INT. RUSSELL HOUSE - KITCHEN

Corn-fed PHIL and GAYLE RUSSELL are the definitive Midwest
parents. Phil wears a mailman's uniform and Gayle wears. a Century
21 blazing yellow blazer.

They stand by the kitchen table. Both seem strangely tense as if
they're suppressing something. The only noise is THE TODAY SHOW
squawking from the small tv on the counter.

: SARAH
Hi.

: PHIL
Hi honey.

Gayle exchanges a look with Phil.
GAYLE
We just talked to Carla. Apparently,
you got an important call this
morning.

Sarah can't believe her ears. This is definitely not how she
wanted them to hear about her illness.

SARAH
I can explain ...

GAYLE
You did it, sweetheart.

Sarah is completely confused by these words.

PHIL
Harvard Med School. You made the cut.

Sarah is stunned. Her parents run to her and envelop her in hugs.

CUT TO:

 
16.

INT. MORRISEY HOUSE - MORNING

Jon and Rick, now in high school, zip around the kitchen gathering
breakfast on the go. Lorraine sorts laundry from a hamper. She
looks at her box of detergent.

LORRAINE
Howard, I need some detergent.
Could you pick it up?

Now dressed in a suit, Howard is walking out the door.

HOWARD
I'm in meetings ‘til 6:15. Jon?

Jon is walking out the back door.

JON
Baseball, Dad.

Rick doesn't wait to be asked as he follows Jon out the back door,
smoothly picking up a set of car keys as he goes.

RICK
Can't Dad. Yearbook meeting.

LORRAINE
Richard! Come back here.

Rick eases back into the house guiltily.

LORRAINE
Your brother's driving.

Rick turns to Howard. He obviously knows it's useless to argue
with Lorraine.

RICK
Dad, I've got my permit. How am
I supposed to learn if I never
drive?

HOWARD
quiet)
Jon's driving. I'11 take you out to
Reservoir Road this weekend for a
few practice runs.

RICK
Thanks Dad.

Rick doesn't even address Lorraine as he runs out the door. Howard
moves to leave. Lorraine puts the last of the detergent in the
washer and lets the lid “accidentally” close with a BANG.

 
HOWARD
(turning back)
Lorraine, can't you just--

She cuts him off with a look. There's tension here that Howard
doesn't have the time or energy to deal with. He gives in.

. HOWARD
(cont., sighs)
I'll try and bring some home at
lunch.

LORRAINE
Thank you.

Howard gives her a quick, awkward kiss on his way out the door.
CUT TO:

INT. RUSSELL HOUSE - DAY

The house is quiet. Everyone has left to live their lives.

Sarah sits in front of the tv. OPRAH is on, but she seems to be
staring through the screen.

Slowly, she stands and approaches the bay window facing the
street. Carefully remaining hidden behind the curtains, she stares
at the Morrisey house.

cur TO:
INT. LORRAINE'S WORKSHOP - DAY
This screened-in workshop is an extension of the house just off
the kitchen. It's cluttered with antique furniture in various
stages of restoration.
Motes of dust dance in the sunlight slanting in the windows as
Lorraine sands the rough spots on a small wooden cedar chest. It's
smaller than a hope chest, but bigger than a jewelry box.

Lorraine is completely caught up in her work.

INT. RUSSELL HOUSE - DAY

It's difficult, but Sarah pulls herself away from the window.
Suddenly, her attention is caught by Oprah's intro:

 
is.

OPRAH WINFREY

(on screen)
Today's topic is "Pregnant Teens Who
Try To Hide Their condition From Their
Parents.“ Are they solving the problem
by dealing with it themselves or avoiding
it by refusing to seek help and advice?
We'll find out in just a moment.

CcuT TO:
INT. RUSSELL HOUSE - GAYLE'S BEDROOM - EVENING

Gayle is sitting on her bed. Papers are spread around her and she
sorts through them. Sarah KNOCKS softly and enters.

GAYLE
Hi.

SARAH
Got a minute?

Gayle is a little surprised. This isn't like Sarah. Gayle pats an
empty spot on the bedspread.

GAYLE
Have a seat.

Gayle pages through a pile of property listings, obviously not
able to find what she's looking for.

SARAH
You were probably wondering why I
came home like I did...

GAYLE
(distracted)
Hmm?
(beat)
I'm sorry if Carla ruined your
surprise.
SARAH

It wasn't about med school.

When Gayle looks up, she notices Sarah's disheveled hair. She
starts to smooth it.

GAYLE
Who cuts your hair? You probably pay
good money ...

Sarah ducks her head away, trying to avoid her mother's hand.

 
19.

SARAH
No mom, it’s okay, I only use my
bad money.

Gayle is too preoccupied to catch Sarah's sarcasm... or maybe she
just doesn't listen.

GAYLE
What do you pay? $30? $35?
SARAH
$50.
(turns)

Look, mom, forget about my hair.

Gayle tries to forget about the hair, but it's difficult. she
finally notices that Sarah's upset about something.

GAYLE
: Sarah, if it‘s the money, don't
worry. I already checked into a
student loan.

SARAH
It's not that. I just don't know if
this is the right thing for me to be
tackling right now--

Gayle is surprised by Sarah's reluctance, but laughs it off.

GAYLE
Oh come on. This is the only thing
you've wanted to tackle since you
graduated.
(beat)
You're just nervous.

Phil sticks his head in the door as he passes by.
PHIL
Just talked to Daniel. He'll be
home tomorrow afternoon.
Sarah is surprised by the news.
GAYLE
All my brilliant offspring under the
same roof. What more could a mother
ask for?

Gayle sees that something is still bothering Sarah.

 
20.

GAYLE
(cont. )
I know this Harvard thing is weird.
You just resigned yourself to not
going and now you're going so stop

worrying.
Gayle reaches out and hugs Sarah. From Sarah's expression, we know
this is very uncharacteristic -- she doesn't quite know how to
react. :

Sarah looks at her mom and herself in the mirror. Gayle is so
happy. Sarah just doesn't know how to tell her the truth.

cur TO:
INT. RUSSELL HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

The next day, we see Sarah sitting in the same spot deep in
thought. she rubs the bridge of her nose as if trying to suppress
some pain.

She tries to pull herself out of it by flipping through the
channels.

SARAH (V.O.)
Why can't I just tell my mother?
Maybe I just want to hold onto my
normal life a little bit longer.
Well ...

(a little laugh)
«+. My reasonable facsimile of a
normal life.

OPRAH is on again. Sarah doesn't want to watch it, but something
draws her to it.

OPRAH WINFREY

Okay ... we're back with "Victims
Of Repressed Guilt And Anger Who.
Manifest That Guilt In An Actual
Physical Illness." My next guest
feels responsible--

Sarah CLICKS the tv off.

once again, she stands and looks out the bay window at the
Morrisey house.

Sarah makes what is probably the hardest decision of her life ...
and heads for the door before she can change her mind.

INT. LORRAINE 'S WORKSHOP - DAY
Lorraine is again working on the cedar chest, carefully replacing
pieces of mother-of-pearl in the intricate design on the box's
lid. she is in a world of her own...
An insulated world that she is in complete control of.
For now.
Until, the doorbell RINGS.
CUT TO:
EXT. MORRISEY HOUSE - FRONT DOOR

Sarah stands waiting. She suddenly realizes she's holding her
breath and lets it out.

After several moments, she decides to walk around the side of the
house.

cuT TO:
INT. LORRAINE'S WORKSHOP

Lorraine has ignored the doorbell. She seems satisfied when it
isn't repeated. All is blissfully silent again.

But then a KNOCK sounds at the screen door that leads outside.
Lorraine looks up with a start, like a rabbit caught in
headlights.

SARAH
(through screen door)

Lorraine recognizes Sarah instantly, but remains silent, as if
hoping she will just go away.

EXT. WORKSHOP

Sarah may have psyched herself up for this, but now that she's
here ... her resolve wants to abandon her. She's never been so
nervous, but she forces herself to try conversation.

SARAH
(cont. )
Well, I just wanted to come over
and say "hi". Can I come in?

Lorraine still doesn't say anything. Sarah hesitates but then
enters anyway.
22.

INT. WORKSHOP

Sarah looks around curiously, Like a tenant interested in renting
the space. Lorraine looks up, surprised by Sarah's audacity.

*awkward“ doesn't begin to describe this meeting. It's obvious
these two haven't spoken in years.

SARAH
I came by to--

Sarah stops abruptly. How is she supposed to do this? Blurt out
“can you forgive me?"? Lorraine looks up, almost as if she heard
Sarah's thoughts.

Sarah avoids Lorraine's intense gaze and instead fingers various
half-finished treasures until she sees the beautiful mother-of-
pearl chest. She tries to use it to jump start a conversation.

SARAH
That's beautiful.

LORRAINE
Is that why you came over? You want
something restored?

Sarah is startled by Lorraine's voice. She grabs onto the lifeline
Lorraine has inadvertently tossed her.

SARAH
Maybe.

LORRAINE
It's pretty simple. Either you do

SARAH “
Well, I don't have a particular
piece in mind. Does everyone bring
stuff to you?

Lorraine realizes that she's going to have to converse.

LORRAINE
Not always. I have a partner who goes
around to estate sales and picks up
things. I restore them and she sells
them.

Lorraine grabs a business card off a nearby rolltop desk and hands
it to Sarah.

LORRAINE
(cont. )
Here's her number. Tell her what kind
of plece you want and she'll give you
an estimate if she can.

Lorraine goes back to work. Conversation over. Sarah's still
looking around. After a moment, Lorraine looks up expectantly.

SARAH:
(hesitant)
I was hoping you could help me find
something.
Sarah's so tense she can't keep a quaver out of her voice.
struggling to be casual, Sarah leans against an ancient table.
Unfortunately, one leg is loose and it teeters precariously.

Lorraine jumps up to steady it before it falls.

LORRAINE
(curt)
No. I don't do that.
SARAH
Are you sure? Maybe you could--
LORRAINE
(interrupting)

"No" is really the strongest negative

I like to use with potential customers.
(motions to box)

Now I really need to get back to work.

SARAH
Well, thanks anyway.

Sarah backs out the door hesitantly.
EXT. MORRISEY HOUSE

Sarah leans against the house for a moment out of Lorraine's
sightline before heading back to her house. It's obvious she's
regretting her move.

EXT. RUSSELL HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

sarah's 21-year-old brother, DANIEL, pulls up in front of their
house in his battered Ford Escort. The car is loaded with luggage
and bags of dirty laundry.

Rather than unload his car, Daniel pulls a basketball out and
starts shooting baskets on their driveway. He is tall and lanky
with an outgoing exuberance.

SARAH (0.C.)
Hey! Welcome home stranger.

Daniel looks up to see Sarah returning from the Morrisey house.
She runs up and gives him a hug.

DANIEL
Welcome home yourself. What're you
doing over there?

He gestures to the Morrisey house.

SARAH
dust saying “hi".

DANTEL
And did you get a reply?

SARAH
(shrugging it off)
Of course. Does she ever leave?

DANIEL
According to mom, no.
(in a creepy Vincent
Price voice)
She only comes out to trim her rose
bushes.

At that moment, Buddy drives up in a white pick-up truck. He gets
out and approaches them.

BUDDY
Hey.

Daniel smiles strangely at Buddy, then looks pointedly at Sarah.

DANIEL
Seems like old times.

Sarah ignores Daniel and goes to meet Buddy.

SARAH
How's your head?

Buddy lifts his hair to show the bruised bump on his forehead.

SARAH
Ooooh. God, I am so sorry. I really
whacked you.

BUDDY
It's okay ... really.
(beat) .
I thought I'd take a look at your
car ... the estimate?
The phone starts RINGING inside the house.
SARAH
Oh ... sure. Let me just get that.
I'll be right back.

Sarah runs into the house. Daniel and Buddy eye each other. Daniel
breaks the tense silence.

DANIEL
How's it going?

BUDDY
Good. How was year three?

Daniel throws the basketball at Buddy hard. Buddy catches it with
finesse and an instant game of one-on-one springs up.

DANIEL
over. Thank God. Advanced thermo
was hell.
Buddy dribbles past Daniel and sinks a basket.

BUDDY
My heart goes out to you.

Daniel smiles faintly at his tone; it implies some long-forgotten
ritual of friendship.

Daniel tries a long shot. It misses and Buddy grabs the rebound.

DANIEL
Well ... my heart goes out to you.

BUDDY

What's Sarah doing home?

DANIEL
(a realization)
You know ... I don't know.

Then Daniel turns to look at Buddy, who stands dribbling.

DANIEL
(cont. )
But, I don't have to guess why

Buddy throws the ball at paniel -- hard -- as Sarah walks out the
front door.

BUDDY
I'm just being friendly.

Buddy gives Daniel a grin which isn't returned.

EXT. RUSSELL HOUSE - DRIVEWAY

Around the back of the house is a separate garage where Sarah's
car is parked. Buddy examines the scrape on her car closely. He
makes notes on a pre-printed form on his clipboard then stands up.

BUDDY
I could fix it for about ...
(mentally figuring)
$60.

SARAH
Are you kidding?

BUDDY
That's just for materials ... well,
the paint. I wouldn't charge you
for labor.

SARAH
Buddy, that's a great price, but
it's no way to run a business.

BUDDY
Sarah, it's Henry now. And you forget
where you are. Customer relations are
what matter in a small community.

SARAH
Customer relations?
(beat)
Okay, Henry. Do I even need to ask
what the catch is?

BUDDY
It's a request.

SARAH
Lemme guess ... a date?

BUDDY
Whatever you want to call it.

Sarah pauses to think about it, The last thing she needs in her
life is a complication. Buddy is obviously itching to be one.

SARAH
Bud--
(catching herself)
Henry.

I don't want you to take this the

Buddy looks down at the ground, humiliated. Sarah relents.

INT. LORRAINE’S WORKSHOP - DAY

Lorraine is putting a coat of varnish on the mother-of-pearl box.

sarah is sitting in a beautiful old rocker paging through a photo
album filled with pictures of Lorraine's work.

SARAH
How'd you get started doing this?

Lorraine continues to work, hoping the question will fade into the
woodwork. But, it just hangs in the air.

LORRAINE
(finally)
My grandmother taught me.

SARAH
Wow. All I ever learned from my
grandma was how to swear in Italian.
(off Lorraine's look)
Hey ... it's been useful.
29,

Lorraine smiles faintly and notices as Sarah rubs her eyes.

SARAH
(cont. )
But, I don’t remember you doing this
before. How'd you start this business?

Lorraine does not appreciate anything vaguely resembling the third
degree. But, Sarah's direct gaze says she's going to keep trying
no matter what. .

LORRAINE
Someone saw the cradle I made for
Jennifer--

Lorraine hesitates on the name, but then goes on deliberately as
if reciting a recipe to a friend,

LORRAINE
--and told me I should go into
business. One job led to another...

Lorraine trails off and gestures to the workshop around her.

Desperate to change the subject, Sarah points to a beautiful
painted chest in the photo albun.

SARAH
What about one like this?

Relieved, Lorraine stands up and moves to look over Sarah's
shoulder.

LORRAINE
That's Czechoslavakian. From the
late 19th Century.
(thinks)
Maureen might be able to find something
similar. But I'11 warn you, it won't
be cheap.

SARAH
But you could do it?

LORRAINE
Sure.

Sarah jumps up and grabs her car keys.
. SARAH
Come with me to Malloy's and we'll
see what he has.

Lorraine sits back down to her varnishing.

LORRAINE
That man wouldn't know an antique
from a lawn ornament.

SARAH
When's the last time you were up
there?
(mo answer)

Come on. I need your expert eye.
LORRAINE
Maureen gets back next week. I'll
send her up there with you then.
Lorraine's tone dismisses the subject. Sarah stands by the door.

SARAH
Why wait?

LORRAINE
Because that's how I do it.

SARAH
(brief hesitation)
Is it because you don't want to leave
the house?

Lorraine looks up from her work slowly. Her eyes are flinty. Anger
smolders there.

LORRAINE
Why don't you just go home, Sarah.

Sarah wants to argue the point, but knows now isn‘t the time.

INT. RUSSELL HOUSE - DINING ROOM - EVENING

Phil and Gayle Russell sit at opposite ends of the dining table.
Sarah and Daniel eat quietly.

PHIL
So, Sarah ... how long are you
home for?

Sarah looks up from her barely-touched meal.
SARAH

Oh, um. It's just a really quiet
time for Martine--
31.

GAYLE
(interrupting,
to Phil)
What kind of a question is that to
ask your daughter? She may be off on
her own, but this is still her home.

Gayle turns to Sarah and speaks with the barest hint of reproach.
GAYLE ~
(cont. )
She doesn't have to answer to us.

Gayle and Phil both look to Sarah as if waiting for the answer she
doesn't have to give. Silence.

DANIEL
(to Sarah)
You going out with Buddy tonight?

Though relieved by the interruption, Sarah gives him a look that
could kill. Phil and Gayle are successfully distracted and highly
amused by the subject.

PHIL
Buddy Carroll? You're finally
giving him a chance?

GAYLE
Now, Phil. Buddy's turned into a
nice-looking young man.

PHIL
Now that he weighs more than a
hundred pounds you mean.

At that moment, the doorbell RINGS.

PHIL
Speaking of the devil?

He jumps up from his seat and goes into the living room. Gayle is
close behind.

Sarah stares at Daniel across the table. He is drinking his milk
when he notices the dagger-shooting look. Busting into laughter,
he almost snorts the milk through his nose.

SARAH
(acid)
Thank you. Thank you very much.

Sarah reluctantly rises and follows her parents into the hall.

INT. RUSSELL HOUSE - FRONT DOOR
Phil and Gayle open the door.

Buddy is standing outside, dressed in a button-down and jeans. He
holds something behind his back.

PHIL
Hey there, Buddy.

Phil motions for him to enter.

GAYLE
How's your dad?

Buddy walks in and Phil closes the door.

BUDDY
{a bit overwhelmed)
Thanks ... he's better.

sarah appears from the dining room and quickly grabs her jacket.

SARAH

Hi.
BUDDY

Hi.

Sarah smiles at her parents and raises her eyebrows.

SARAH
Bye.

She takes a grateful Buddy by the arm and quickly pulls him out
the door.

EXT. RUSSELL HOUSE - NIGHT
Buddy walks Sarah to his truck.
BUDDY
Is it my imagination or is this
prom night?

Sarah's clearly a little uncomfortable, but she's determined to be
nice.
33.

SARAH
I'm sorry. They've gotten kind of
flaky in their old age. Stepford
parents with brief flashes of
lucidity.

As Buddy holds the door of his truck for her, he finally remembers
to give Sarah the small bouquet of daisies from behind his back.

‘BUDDY -
It's not a corsage but ...

Sarah takes them and breathes in their fragrance.

SARAH
Buddy Carroll, the romantic mechanic.
who would have guessed?

Buddy is a little hurt by the hint of sarcasm Sarah can't keep out
of her voice.

BUDDY
Well, that's why I'm giving you this
once-in-a-lifetime chance to spend
quality time with me ... and please
call me “Henry”.

Buddy smiles and slams the door. He runs around the front of the
truck, slips and disappears from view. A moment later, he jumps up
and raises his arms in the "touchdown" signal. Sarah LAUGHS.

cur TO:
INT. WILLOUGHBY'S - NIGHT

This is a honky-tonk. It is not a subtle place. The beer flows
freely, many a delicate foot is stepped on by a clunky boot and

you might get scorched stepping between some of the smoldering
glances being exchanged. Not Sarah's kind of place.

Buddy and Sarah are sitting at a small table near the dance floor
nursing two draft beers. Buddy taps his foot as he watches the
dancing. Sarah stares into her beer.

BUDDY
You wanna--
(turning to Sarah)
Sarah, you okay?

Sarah's mind is elsewhere. She snaps herself out of it.

SARAH
Bmmm?

Buddy catches her glancing around apprehensively.

BUDDY
I was gonna ask if you ...
(feeling lame) .
wanted to dance.

SARAH
Buddy, I hate to tell you, but line
dancing isn't really my thing.

Buddy stares at her until she drops her eyes.

BUDDY
Just like high school, huh? It
isn't cool so you'il just sit in
the bleachers?

SARAH

Buddy. I never did figure out the
rules in high school. Are you gonna
hold it against me that I was a senior
when you were a fresh--

(stops herself)
No. I'm not going to have this
conversation. I already hear myself
defending something that I have no
reason to be defensive about.

BUDDY
Sarah, Sarah, holdon...

Buddy takes her hand and tries to pull her to the dance floor. she
resists.

BUDDY
I don't wanna talk.

SARAH
Fine, but I don't wanna dance.

Buddy obviously wants to bridge the gulf between them and he seems
convinced that this is the way. Sarah will take some convincing.

BUDDY
I'll let you lead.

He does a few casual steps and joins the line of dancing folk.

SARAH
Buddy! It's line dancing. I don't
know how to do it. I don't want to
know how to do it. How can I lead?

Sarah softens her words with a weak smile as she looks around for
her escape, but Buddy's hand pulls her into the line.

She's horrible. It really doesn't look like any amount of practice
is going to help.

INT. LORRAINE'S WORKSHOP - SAME TIME

Lorraine's hands carefully wrap the finished mother-of-pearl chest
in protective brown paper.

She glances out the screen door and sees Buddy helping Sarah out
of the truck. Lorraine gets up and approaches the door for a
better view. She can‘t seem to look away.

EXT. RUSSELL HOUSE

Buddy walks Sarah to the front door. The porchlight is on. They
stand in uncomfortable silence for a moment.

SARAH
Thanks. I had fun.
BUDDY
(quickly)
No you didn't, but ... thanks for
humoring me.
He turns to go.
SARAH

Buddy, I'm not trying to be ...

She doesn‘t know how to verbalize what she's feeling. Buddy turns
back reluctantly.

BUDDY

You know what? Keep calling me Buddy.
It really helps put me in my place.

Look, I'm sorry if I made you
uncomfortable tonight. Nobody saw us
out together if that’s what you're
worried about.

SARAH
Oh ... no.

Buddy turns away, put stops short. He can't face her and say what

he has to say.

BUDDY
Sarah, remember when I followed you
around all the time?

SARAH
(quietly)
Yeah ...
BUDDY
Well, I wasn’t stupid.
(beat)

I was just ... fourteen.

He walks away. Sarah watches him for a beat then runs down the
steps and catches him as he's reaching for the truck's handle.

Sarah takes his face in her hands and kisses him deeply. Buddy is
completely taken aback.

Without a word, Sarah runs inside and closes the front door.

o~ ON BUDDY: He seems paralyzed, lips still slightly parted as if
waiting for an instant replay of that kiss.

INT. LORRAINE 'S WORKSHOP

Lorraine stands at the screen door watching the little drama
unfold. Her expression is grim, but also a bit wistful.

Lorraine enters the room and watches Howard. His face is relaxed
in sleep and he almost looks as young and hopeful as Buddy.

Lorraine lies down a safe distance from him. She reaches out and
touches his cheek, smiling at the SCRATCH of his stubble. He stirs

cars in various stages of repair. Buddy approaches.

Millions of stars provide the only canopy for this open air
section of the shed. A tinny portable tv is tuned to Jay Leno.

Rick shoves him in the shoulder as he gets up and rinses his dish.

It's that time of the year.

Jon stops to think and then shakes his head, depressed by some
realization.

Howard makes a cup of instant coffee, grimacing at the taste.

Don't worry. It's not so bad. I

INT. MORRISEY HOUSE - JENNIFER'S BEDROOM

This room has gone from bedroom to shrine. Dusty from disuse, —
diapers and lotions are still stacked on the changing table. Tiny
dresses are visible hanging in the closet. A mobile dangles from

the ceiling, destined never to be wound again.

Still in her robe with her hair tousled, Lorraine sits with her
forehead resting on a gleaming wooden cradle. The movement of her
body as she quietly SOBS makes the cradle rock gently.

CUT TO:
INT. MORRISEY HOUSE - FLASHBACK

We're back among the flashing lights and EMT's. Lorraine walks in
the front door and through a house bustling with grim energy. But,
everything is strangely silent.

IN THE KITCHEN:

12-year-old Sarah stands at the door to the basement erying. A
POLICEWOMAN is taking Jon and Ricky upstairs to put them to bed.
Lorraine glances at the boys, put we sense she wasn't worried
about them.

Sarah runs up to Lorraine and tries to explain what happened, but
Sarah's mouth works silently. All we hear is the blood RUSHING in
Lorraine's ears. Lorraine pushes Sarah aside and goes down the
stairs. :

IN THE BASEMENT:

EMT's huddle around a tiny body sprawled on the unfinished
concrete floor. Jennifer. Dead. Her walker lies on its side a few
feet away like a wrecked roadster.

Lorraine ignores the sympathetic faces as she bends down to pick
Jennifer up. Someone's hand reaches to stop her, but then
withdraws.

SARAH'S POV AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS:

Sarah watches as Lorraine carries Jennifer's body up the stairs.
The baby's Gerber pajamas are unmarked by blood. Lorraine's arm
automatically supports Jennifer‘s broken neck. The baby could be
sleeping .-.

Lorraine looks up at Sarah. The sorrow in Lorraine's eyes is more
devastating than any anger could ever be.

have barely softened the pain. .

Now anger has joined in the fray.

She shakes his hand and he points to the table.

father actually said that. Ray LAUGHS, pleased that he achieved
the desired result on both counts.

RAY

But there is something pbuilding in Lorraine and she's got to let

baseball bat. :

with a sense of determination, she walks down the hall.

Frustration and anger pulse under her temple as she raises the bat
high to destroy the cradle. It wavers there for a moment.

She almost seems to be calming down until ... a flash of color

WOMAN in a navy pantsuit is standing by the front door. Her hands
flutter to her mouth and then back to her side as she tries to
decide what to do. Howard turns to look where she's looking ...

with her hair flying loose and her robe whipping in the wind, a
wild-looking Lorraine is POUNDING the rosebushes to 4 fragrant
pulp with the baseball bat.

she edges toward the workshop's screen door as Howard edges toward
Lorraine.

Her muttering voice is barely audible as she swats half-heartedly
at the broken stems. She's like a wind-up toy nearing the end of
its run.
HOWARD
(softly)
Honey? Lorraine?

She looks up suddenly and sees Howard. she smiles sweetly --- Like
a child and holds up one finger in a “just a minute" gesture.

LORRAINE
Almost done.

HOWARD

(smiling too)
Honey, I'11 finish that later. Let's
go inside.

He slowly reaches out, takes the baseball bat from her hands and
starts to lead her to the house.

HOWARD

We're going to plant something new
there. How about some tulips?

LORRAINE
Tulips. Mums.

Mums the word.

Gladys steps out of the workshop, holding the finished box. She
peeks under the protective brown paper as she walks rather quickly
to the car.

GLADYS
I left the check on the desk.
(uncomfortable)
Thank you Lorraine. It looks just
lovely.

Now standing on the stoop arm-in-arm, Howard and Lorraine almost
look like a normal Norman Rockwell couple.

Lorraine looks after Gladys strangely, even managing a wave.

Howard nods as he tries to lead Lorraine inside. There is a small

violence. His eyes betray how much her rejection hurts pefore he
can hide it, but his voice is full of patience.

Buddy gestures expansively to the open fields.

BUDDY
Well, you need a lot of time to

Sarah's head is propped on her arm as she leans out the window.

SARAH
All I have is time.

Buddy considers this statement, then suddenly pulls onto a quiet
dirt road.

EXT. DIRT ROAD - AERIAL SHOT

Buddy's pick-up leaves a high plume of dust as it rockets toward
the deep forest separated from the road by cultivated fields.

EXT. SHADY NOOK - AFTERNOON

Huge oaks shade this idyllic spot. A slow-moving but incredibly
clear river sparkles in the afternoon sun. The stuff of dreams.

SARAH
Oh, Buddy ... it’s like a Coors
commercial.

Buddy spreads his arms wide and breathes in a deep, exaggerated
breath.

BUDDY

God's Country.

Buddy pulls fishing poles and bait out of the back of the pick-up.
Like line dancing, Sarah automatically resists.

SARAH
(laughing)
oh, Buddy, no. I haven't done this

Buddy expertly baits a hook and hands the rod to her then goes to
work on his own.

When I said all I have is time, I
did not mean ...

What did you mean, Sarah?

Sarah looks at the pole, trying to remember how to cast. she
smiles suddenly as she accepts the challenge.

SARAH
Okay ... sure.

{gaining confidence)
I just ... do this ... thingie ...

Sarah holds her thumb down on the reel release as she pulls the
rod back ..-

SARAH
... and then let ‘er rip!

Sarah's gusto takes her bait all the way across the river. It gets
stuck in some rocks on the other side. Buddy starts LAUGHING.

MONTAGE OF BUDDY AND SARAH FISHING:

- Buddy stands behind sarah and guides her arm, trying to get her
cast under control.

- Buddy demonstrates a perfect catch as he reels in a wiggling
trout.

- Sarah LAUGHS as her line gets stuck and Buddy falls in trying to
release it.

- Sarah casually glances at Buddy, who is lying on a rock in the
sun trying to dry out his wet clothes. He looks good.

- Now they're both lying on rocks, eyes closed as they soak up the
sun. .

SARAH
Buddy, how did you know to bring
me here?

BUDDY

Well Sarah, you always were the last
person to know what's good for you.

The stream GURGLES on, unaware of the forces of nature drawing
Buddy and Sarah closer even as they lie, not touching, eyes still
closed, on their respective rocks.

INT. MORRISEY HOUSE - BATHROOM
46.

Lorraine sits on the edge of the tub. She's covered with leaves,
brambles and tiny cuts from the thorns on the rosebushes.

Howard kneels in front of her, washing her off with a washcloth.
He gently applies antiseptic to her cuts and puts bandages on.
Lorraine's eyes slowly regain focus. She's back among the living.

Howard looks up as if sensing this.

HOWARD
You okay?

Lorraine nods, but then starts crying.

LORRAINE
I'm sorry. How do you-~- Why do you ...
(long hesitation)
Stay?

Howard just pulls Lorraine into a hug. She hangs on like a
drowning woman as the sobs gradually lessen.

INT. BUDDY'S PICKUP ~ MOVING SHOT - LATER

Buddy and Sarah are heading back to town. Buddy's hair is still
damp from his accidental swin.

SARAH

(laughing)
I don't know if I really believe
there are any fish in Silo Creek.

BUDDY
So you're saying I planted the
two rainbow trout I caught?

SARAH
You just have more of an affinity
with the local wildlife. They sense
you're a townie.

Buddy looks at Sarah. A “townie” isn't what Buddy wants to be.

BUDDY
Yeah, I guess I am.
SARAH
(realizing)
Oh, Buddy. I'm sorry. I'm a dork.
I talk ... then I think. It's a

medical condition.

BUDDY
You gotta call ‘em like you see ‘em.

There is a hint of bitterness in his voice, but he smiles to show
her he isn't mad.

SARAH
' (hesitantly)
What about your plans for college?
You were gonna go to U of 1, right?

BUDDY
(evasive)
Yeah, engineering. But, I didn't
go.
SARAH
Didn't you try j.c. for a couple
semesters?
' BUDDY
(ironic)

- Yeah. Real exciting.

Buddy isn't elaborating and Sarah decides not to push.

oo :
As they pass the park, Sarah notices Daniel playing basketball
with friends. She also notices a young WOMAN with a TODDLER
watching.
SARAH
(excitedly)
Can you drop me off here?
(glances in side mirror)
Do I look like a complete goober?
Buddy pulls over.
BUDDY
(looking at her)
your nose is sunburned and the
effect is charming.
Sarah smiles at his words and turns to him before climbing out.
SARAH
So you'il call me when it‘s done?
BUDDY
I'll call you sooner if I can come
~~ up with a good excuse.

She closes the door behind her and speaks through the open window.
SARAH

Well, we have sugar if you need a
cup, my dad and I host a mean game
of Scrabble ...

(she glances at

the basketball game)
and I'm sure Daniel would love to
catch up.

Buddy catches her meaning, but chooses to ignore it.
BUDDY
on second thought, I'll call you
when it's done.

He drives off with a wave.

EXT. PARK - BLEACHERS

Daniel waves to Sarah as she approaches, but can‘t take his eyes
off the game for long.

The young woman, SUSAN, stands up when she sees Sarah, obviously
not believing her eyes.

SUSAN
Sarah?!

.Susan runs to greet Sarah. Her two-year-old toddler, DYLAN,
follows her, caught up in his mother's excitement.

EXT. PARK - CONCESSION STAND

Dylan sucks all the juice out of a-rainbow-colored snow cone then
hands it to his mother. He runs off to play on the brightly-
colored jungle gym. Susan and Sarah sit on a bench eating snow
cones.

SUSAN
So if I take at least sixteen credits
a semester -- yeah, right -- I can

graduate next spring. Then there's
RN certification, a placement program ...

SARAH
(amazed)
How do you ... do it?

SUSAN (MORE }
Don't ask. I mean, Jeff has been great.
But just be glad you were smart enough
49.

SUSAN (CONT. )
to do it the right way. My mom told me
about Harvard Med. That‘s great.

Sarah's mouth tightens in a brief flash of anger. She looks away
quickly.

SARAH
I guess news travels fast.

SUSAN
you ain't in Chicago anymore, Dorothy.

SARAH
So you really think I'm the smart one?

SUSAN
Are you kidding? You're working
towards your goal, no distractions,
a career to die for ...

At that moment, Dylan comes barreling toward them and jumps into
Susan's arms. Susan tries to get him to say “hello” to Sarah, but
he burrows his head into her shoulder shyly.

SUSAN

(cont. )
... While I take two steps forward
and the tiger here pulls me three
steps back.

(Dylan growls

like a tiger)
Just imagine if you had kids!

Sarah looks at Dylan for a moment, imagining just that. His
freckles and crooked smile only add to the angelic appearance.

INT. RUSSELL HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - EVENING

A loud KNOCKING goes on and on. Sarah answers the door. Howard
Morrisey stands there, exuding righteous anger.

HOWARD
I need to speak to you.

INT. RUSSELL HOUSE - DEN

Sarah leads Howard into the den, reassuring her parents that
everything is fine and closing the door on their curious looks.

HOWARD
Have you been talking to my wife?
50.

SARAH
(hesitant)
I’ve talked to her about a chest,
yeah.
HOWARD

Do you really think that's wise?
sarah pauses, mentally measuring her words before speaking.

SARAH
I certainly never meant-- I don't
mean to cause any ... harm.

HOWARD
unfortunately, you in my wife's
life ... is causing harm.

Sarah is visibly upset. Howard doesn't want to make her feel
worse, but he's got to get his point across.

HOWARD
(cont. }
Sarah ... it was an accident and
you've been able to put it behind

you.

Sarah's eyes widen in disbelief at this statement. Howard doesn’t
notice.

HOWARD

(cont. )
But, Lorraine can't forget it and
seeing you does not help. We have
to live with it every day. In order
for us to do that, I have to ask you
to stay away from Lorraine while
you're home.

SARAH
What if I'm home for good?
HOWARD
It doesn't matter.
(quietly)

Please just let her be.
He doesn't wait for her answer or for her to show him out.

cur TO:
INT, MORRISEY KITCHEN - NIGHT
Lorraine finishes drying the dinner dishes. she places them in
their carefully designated places in the cupboard. She turns to
the kitchen, needing something else to do ... but her home is in
perfect order. There's nothing else she can do.
Howard walks in. He wants to touch her. To hug her. To soothe her.
HOWARD -
(quiet)
No one's going to bother you anymore.

But, he just leaves. Lorraine watches him go and slowly drops into
one of the kitchen chairs, lowering her head inte her hands.

cUuT TO:
EXT, RUSSELL BACK PORCH - NIGHT

Sarah sits in a lawn chair on the screened-in back porch, staring
through the stars.

Daniel comes outside and sits on the step beside her. He holds a
wicked-looking lawn dart with plastic wings. 50's era family fun.

DANIEL
Wanna play night jarts?

Sarah comes back to Earth and smiles.
SARAH

The most dangerous game in ten
states? I'll pass.

DANIEL
Wanna tell me what you're doing with
Buddy?
Sarah turns to look at Daniel.
SARAH

That was a shitty segue. Why don't
you tell me what you're doing with
Buddy?

DANIEL
That's between him and me.

SARAH
But, you two used to be inseparable.
(sighs)
He was your best friend.
52.

Daniel is uncomfortable and doesn't want to talk about it.
DANIEL
Yeah, well, you're my only sister
and I have no fucking clue what's
going on with you.

Sarah LAUGHS and glances back inside to make sure her parents
aren't listening. .

SARAR
Watch your language.
(beat)
What do you want to know?

DANIEL
What you're doing here. Really.

He looks at her closely when she doesn't answer.

DANIEL

(cont. )
X don't think you came back to
fulfill Buddy Carroll's high school
wet dreams.

(beat)
And, the folks and I are very
curious what Howard Morrisey had
to say to you.

Sarah nods her head as his plan becomes clear.

SARAH
Of course. Send the sweet-faced
one to get the dirt.

DANIEL
No. You're just ... acting really
weird.

Sarah stands up and heads back inside.

SARAH
I don't know what the big deal is.
I asked Mrs. Morrisey to make me
something. She said “no". That's
all there is to it.

She SLAMS the screen door behind her.

A KNOCK echoes as we see a door opening and bright sunlight
silhouetting a figure.

INT. RUSSELL HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - DAY
sarah is astounded to see Lorraine Morrisey standing outside.

LORRAINE
Alright. Let's go.

SARAH
You ... crossed the street?

Lorraine looks around her as if realizing for the first time.

To get to the other side. Yeah.

Lorraine smiles faintly.

INT. ESCORT

Sarah turns the car off and looks at Lorraine, who is gripping the
passenger seat as if it's her new best friend .

LORRAINE
I may have been a bit hasty.

Lorraine watches the people passing on the sidewalk as if eyeing
sharks at an exhibit. She turns back to Sarah, emanating fear and
potential panic.

LORRAINE
(cont. )
I don't think I can do this.

SARAH
(shrugs)
Whatever.

Sarah gets out and stands there waiting. Now people seem to stare
at Lorraine even more. Finally, Lorraine opens her car door.

cur TO:
54.

EXT. STANTON - MAIN STREET SIDEWALK

Lorraine and sarah walk down the sidewalk. Sarah casually
windowshops. Lorraine resolutely stares straight ahead as if
taking a sobriety test, struggling to stay oblivious to the
curious stares of passing people.

As Lorraine continues on, we see .-.-

— an older WOMAN in a clothing store jumping out of her chair and
craning her head for a better Look.

- A young BOY walking with his mother, trying to figure out
what’s so unusual about Lorraine that everyone is staring at.

- The two racewalking women approach from the other direction and
are so startled, they almost run into Lorraine.

As Lorraine and Sarah disappear into "Malloy's Antiques", Woman 1
bends to Woman 2's ear.

WOMAN 1
What on earth? Hasn't she caused that
woman enough grief?

WOMAN 2
I told you ... trouble.

INT. MALLOY'S - DAY

This dusty old shop is full of piles of junk, which the ancient
and clueless owner, IRV MALLOY, will insist are all “gen-u-ine
coll-ectibles".

He sits up from his rickety chair as Lorraine and Sarah enter the
shop. His cigarette falls from his lips into the newspaper he was
reading and starts to smolder.

Lorraine takes a deep breath of air and seems comforted by the
antiques surrounding her. She notices Irv's smoking paper and
smiles.

LORRAINE
Irv, you really think you should
be starting a fire in a shop full
of hundred year old wood?

Irv throws the paper to the floor and stamps on it.
IRV

(under his breath)
Well I'11 be damned.

 
55.

Lorraine nods a greeting which Irv returns in a typically non-
verbal Midwestern fashion.

Sarah pulls Lorraine over to a box similar to the one she saw in
the book. Lorraine inspects it carefully before giving her
whispered approval.

LORRAINE .
you've got a good eye. I think it's
Rumanian. Great lines. Solid. .

She eyes the carved and painted design on the wooden lid. The
colors have all faded, but the fine craftsmanship is self-evident.

Lorraine eyes Irv out of the corner of her eye.

LORRAINE
Irv will never know what he's got
... unless I try to buy this.

Sarah thinks for a moment then smiles.

SARAH
{loudly)
Well I don't care what you think.
I'm gonna buy it anyway.

Lorraine stares at Sarah for a moment before catching on and
raising her voice so Irv can hear.

LORRAINE
It's your money. But don't expect me
to restore it. I've gotta have some-
thing to work with.

Lorraine points to the box's supposedly shoddy workmanship.
LORRAINE
(cont. )
I can't perform miracles.
Sarah grabs the box protectively and walks up to Irv.
SARAH
(defiantly)
Then I'11 leave it just the way it
is.

INT. LORRAINE'S WORKSHOP

Lorraine and Sarah walk in the screen door. Sarah can't suppress a
satisfied smile as she sets the box down gently.

SARAH
Thirty bucks.

Lorraine walks around the box, eyeing it from all angles. Her mind
is already racing.

LORRAINE
Yeah ... I can do this.

Sarah takes a seat on an old rocker and rocks excitedly.

SARAE
Can I watch?

Lorraine stares at Sarah for a long moment.

. LORRAINE
Well, that's not really how I work.

SARAH
Oh please. I'd really like to learn
how to do it.

sarah is pushing Lorraine's limits.

LORRAINE
Sarah, I'm doing this.
(beat)
why don't we just let it go at that.

Lorraine voice is gentle but firm. It brooks no argument. Sarah
nods slowly. The exertion of the day is starting to show in her
face.

SARAH
I'm sorry. You're right.

Sarah stands to go and almost falls over. Lorraine reaches out to
steady her.

LORRAINE
You okay?

SARAH
(nodding)
I got too much sun yesterday. And
the rocker ...

Sarah trails off. Lorraine smiles curiously -- since when has
three minutes on a rocker ever made anyone dizzy?

LORRAINE
Yeah, it rocks. They're funny that way.
57.

As sarah heads for the screen door, Lorraine relents.

LORRAINE
Look, Sarah ... the door's usually
open if you want to, you know, check
on my progress.

SARAH
Maybe I'll do that. ~

And then Sarah's gone.

Gayle is a bit unnerved by illness of any kind, but she smiles
brightly to hide her discomfort.

GAYLE

I'll be back by one.

You'll be okay?

Sarah looks like hell. She nods wearily, but stops her mother
before she can leave the room

SARAH

Sarah's face is as white as her sheets. She takes two more of the

his coffee.

Keep that coffee cup a safe distance

Howard sets the cup on Lorraine's desk.

HOWARD
Don't worry. I've been trained by
the best.

LORRAINE
Coaster?

Howard LAUGHS and reaches over to place the coffee cup on a
coaster.

HOWARD
You have paint on your nose.

Lorraine pauses to wipe it, spreading more pale green paint on her
nose and even getting a smear on her cheek.

LORRAINE
How's that?

HOWARD
Good. You're starting to look like
the Wicked Witch of the West.

Lorraine looks at Howard for a moment, wondering if that's a
veiled comment on her attitude. But, his smile is innocent enough.

He takes a rag and very carefully wipes the paint off her face.
They are very close and we see a brief hint of the chemistry that
brought these two together.
Lorraine steps back awkwardly and the spell is broken.
LORRAINE

Thank you.
Howard stares at the new box as he retrieves his coffee and sips.

HOWARD

twelve years? :

LORRAINE
Well, it is the girl's name.

HOWARD
I thought ... you didn't want to have
anything to do with her.

LORRAINE
I never said that.

Howard hesitates, but then lets it go. He doesn't really want to
say "You said it after you demolished the rose bushes". He glances
at his watch.

sarah will never forget the moment of frustrated helplessness that
established the course of her career.-

But, she isn't about to relate that story in answer to the essay

to cover it.

I was just on my way .--

Sarah admires the work Lorraine has already done on the box.
LORRAINE

Sarah. I told you to come by any
time you wanted.

SARAH
I thought maybe you were just being
polite.
LORRAINE

Well I think it's been a while since
anyone has interpreted my behavior
as “polite”.

Sarah starts walking around the workshop as Lorraine continues.
Lorraine's voice implies she doesn't care what people think, but
Sarah can't help but wonder.

LORRAINE
(cont. )
I’m sure most of the terms people
use around town are decidedly not
polite.

Unwilling to comment, Sarah examines an old quilt hanging on a
quilt-rack. The beautiful antique is composed of thousands of tiny
triangles of every sort of material, none larger than a paper
clip.
65.

SARAH
Did you make this?

LORRAINE
No. My great-great-great grandmother

started that in 1855. Everything is
hand-stitched.

CLOSE ON THE QUILT: Intricate curliques decorate the seams. The

amount of work put into it is staggeringly obvious. It's truly a
work of art.

SARAH
(disbelieving)
yeah right. Wouldn't it .-- fall
apart or something?

LORRAINE
Apparently not. I still use it. It
went to the 1904 World's Fair in St.
Louis and would have taken the top
prize if my idiot Aunt Moria hadn‘t
machine stitched the border.

SARAH :
You shouldn't talk about her like
that.

LORRAINE

Why not? Just because she was born

a hundred years ago doesn’t mean.

she had the wisdom of the ages.

Everyone makes mistakes.

Sarah looks up quickly at that ... ‘is it directed towards her?
Lorraine's face betrays nothing.

SARAH
Would you ever consider selling it?

LORRAINE
Impossible. It's been passed down '
through the women in my family for
five generations--

Lorraine stops abruptly as she realizes that she has no daughter
to pass it on to. Sarah realizes at the same time.

SARAH
I'm sorry. I'm gonna go. I mean,
I've got to go ... something to go
to. Maybe tomorrow, I can help ...

LORRAINE
Maybe.

Buddy and Sarah sit on a blanket as the small town orchestra warms
up before playing their program of classical music. Fireflies
provide mood lighting as the sun prepares to set.

It's a gorgeous evening on the brink of summer.

Buddy unpacks a picnic hamper: wine, cheese, bread, fruit. Sarah
can't suppress a smile as she watches Buddy's efforts. The goal is
definitely to impress Sarah.

BUDDY
Granted it isn't lunch on the Seine ...

SARAH
It's trés continental.
(notices something)
I can't believe they carry paté
at the Stanton IGA.

BUDDY
I had to go to Alton for that.

Buddy tries to uncork the wine, but only manages to break the cork
halfway, sealing the wine in the bottle forever.

BUDDY
Ten points for trying.

He pulls two cold beers out of the ‘hamper. Sarah LAUGHS as he
hands her one.

SARAH
So ... what was it that was so
important? Why was I meeting you

here?

SARAH
(ironic, to herself)
you were closer with Memorial Day.

BUDDY
What?

SARAH
I said ... salud!

”~ she clinks bottles with him.
LATER ...-

The orchestra plays surprisingly well. In a small town, there's
plenty of time to practice. A lilting Brahm's melody is putting
everyone in the mood.

Buddy reaches over tentatively and takes Sarah's hand. He pulls
her closer and kisses her softly. Electricity is in the air. Sarah
has to make a real effort to retain her composure.

SARAH
(smiling)
you have created a situation that
4s simultaneously very cheesy and
ineredibly romantic.

How do you do that?

BUDDY

You inspire me to push the boundaries
of the imagination.

SARAH

Buddy cuts her off with a kiss both passionate and sweet.

‘nough talking.

INT, LORRAINE'S WORKSHOP - DAY
Sarah sits next to a wooden chair, diligently sanding one leg.

Lorraine has given her a practice piece, but she may be regretting
the impulse. She looks over at Sarah and sighs.

LORRAINE
Sarah, you're making a gallant
effort, but...

SARAH
But what?

sarah's enthusiasm makes it difficult to criticize.

LORRAINE
Lemme see that.

sarah grins as she steps’ back to let Lorraine see the chair.

They both realize that the leg she has been sanding is now much
skinnier than the others. Sarah is humiliated but Lorraine smiles
encouragingly. .

LORRAINE
You've got the right idea. Just don't
think about it so much.

Sarah furrows her brow, not quite getting it.

LORRAINE
(cont. )
Sanding is like sex. It's all in
the rhythms.

SARAH
Gee. Those are two worlds I never
thought would collide.

Lorraine smiles. Sarah stands up, holding the small of her back.

LORRAINE
you're pretty young to have a bad
back. :

sarah smiles and tries to cover the very real pain.

SARAH

This is what a desk job does to you.

Sarah goes to the closet where Lorraine keeps supplies for a fresh
piece of sandpaper. Inside, she finds the cradle hidden under a
pile of old blankets and bends down to examine it.

SARAH
Hey, what's-- Is this the famous
cradle that started the business?

Lorraine NOTICES and the mood darkens.

. LORRAINE
Just let that be.

Lorraine's voice is sharper than she intended it to be. Sarah
stands, unsure what she did wrong.

SARAH
I‘m- I'm sorry.

Lorraine doesn't say anything, but Sarah notices that her hands
are shaking. Sarah looks closely at the cradle and remembers whose
it was. :

SARAH

(gently)
you really shouldn't let that sit
unused.

LORRAINE
Why? You planning on having a baby?

SARAH
(wincing)
No. I'm not going to have any.

Lorraine eyes Sarah strangely, perhaps picking up on something in
her voice that everyone else has been ignoring.
But, her building anger is overwhelming her concern.

LORRAINE
you're awfully young to be making
a statement like that.

Lorraine goes back to the detailed painting, but her hands are
still shaking. She messes up.

LORRAINE
Godammit! Look at that.

sarah grabs the paint thinner. She dabs some on the end of what
looks like a long q-tip.

SARAH
Here.

sarah holds the swab out to Lorraine.

But, Lorraine's shaking has increased. Sarah looks at her,
guessing what's really wrong, but unable to fix it.

Slowly, Lorraine lowers her face into her hands and SOBS.

After several moments, Lorraine looks up at Sarah and examines her
face, looking deep into her eyes.

LORRAINE
(finally)
What are you doing here Sarah?

SARAH
I... you're making me--

she gestures to the box -- the self-evident answer.
LORRAINE
I thought I could do this.
(beat)
When you walked in that door last
week, I thought maybe you'd finally
come to apologize for what happened.

EXT. MORRISEY HOUSE

Howard pulls in the driveway. He gets out of the car and walks in
the front door.

INT, MORRISEY HOUSE - KITCHEN

Howard walks in and hears Lorraine's voice raised in the workshop.
71.

INT. LORRAINE 'S WORKSHOP

Lorraine has taken the swab and dabs at the mistake, struggling to
remain calm. It's a losing battle.

LORRAINE .
But, you're just making it worse.

Sarah's voice struggles to stay even.

SARAH
I’m sorry.

Lorraine angrily throws the swab to the ground.

_ LORRAINE

(voice cracking)
Is that supposed to help? Why didn't
you just-- Why weren't you there? Why
didn't you stop her? Her neck was ...
broken. No one that little should
hurt like that. She was a baby. You
have to watch them.

Sarah's cool facade shows signs of eracking.

SARAH
I did. I tried.

LORRAINE
(overlapping)
We left you in charge. You were
responsible!

SARAH
(a whisper)
I'm sorry. .

LORRAINE
sorry? You keep saying that like it
means something. That doesn't change--

A harsh voice of reason interrupts Lorraine's hysterics.

HOWARD (0.C.)
(interrupting)
Lorraine, stop it.

Startled, Lorraine and Sarah look up to see Howard, who has
entered unnoticed.

LORRAINE
(a plea)
But, she's got to tell me why.
72.

HOWARD
, No Lorraine.

LORRAINE
If I just understood why--

HOWARD
(interrupting)
What? It would all be okay? You'd
be a whole person? We'd be a normal
, family again?

Howard rips his coat off and throws it over a chair. There is an
rs ember of frustration that’s been smoldering in Howard for years.
Now it's igniting.

HOWARD
(cont. }
you know, Lorraine, for twelve years,
every look you gave me said “Why
didn't you fix the latch on the
, basement door like you promised you
: would?".
(beat)
ao Every look you gave the boys said
“why did you fight and distract
Sarah?"

This information is a revelation to Lorraine.

LORRAINE
No. I never ...

HOWARD

Don't you think I've been hurting?
or the boys? We miss her every day.

(beat)
There are no answers for your “why"'s
Lorraine. Bad things happen to good
people. All the time. It's no one's
fault.

Howard is getting through to Lorraine. For once, she's able to put

her own sorrow aside and see another point-of-view.

LORRAINE
I hurt the boys?

HOWARD
o~ yeah. They used to have a mother.
They really liked her too.
The screen door, caught by the wind, SLAMS behind Sarah, who has
left unnoticed.

HOWARD
: (quietly)
Everyone used to like her.

after a moment, Howard runs out after Sarah.

EXT. MORRISEY HOUSE ~ FRONT YARD

sarah is running across the street towards her house. Howard YELLS
after her. .

HOWARD
Sarah! Wait!

garah doesn't slow and Howard runs after her.

EXT. RUSSELL HOUSE ~ FRONT YARD

Howard reaches Sarah and stops her from entering her house. When
~~ she turns, he sees that the dam has finally burst and she can't
stop crying.

SARAH
I didn't go back over! she came
to my door. And I was-- she was
so happy that she came across the
street. I didn't ask her-- I never
meant ..-

sarah SOBS uncontrollably. Howard hugs her to him and tries to
comfort her.

. HOWARD
Oh God, Sarah. I wasn't gonna yell
at you. I know it's not your fault.

SARAH
(muffled, into
his shirt)

But, it is. I have proof.

He holds her face so she can see how serious he is.

HOWARD
None of it is your fault. Okay?

Howard isn't satisfied until sarah meets his eyes and nods almost
imperceptibly.
74.

Howard suddenly realizes the intimacy of their situation there on
the front yard. He draws his hands back and laughs self-
consciously-

HOWARD
She actually walked across the
street?

sarah's breath hitches in her throat as she struggles to regain
her usually-impregnable composure.
SARAH
(nodding)
We went downtown too.

Howard's face fills with amazement.

HOWARD
She didn't say a word to me.
SARAH
t think she's still getting her ...

sea legs.

Howard turns to walk back to his house, but gets in one last
parting shot.

HOWARD
Well, if that's the fault of anyone
we know ... tell her "thank you".

CUT TO:
INT. RUSSELL HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT

It looks like the cover of a 1970's-era Milton Bradley game. Phil,
Gayle, Daniel and Sarah sit at a rumpus room card table playing
Scrabble. Sarah takes her turn. .

she's had a hell of a day, feels like shit and isn't really
concentrating. .

PHIL
Sarah, are you losing your edge?
You've never left me a triple
word score in your life.

Phil starts to place tiles when Buddy appears at the door and
walks halfway down the stairs.

BUDDY
Hi. Sorry to interrupt. I knocked
on the door, but ...
75.

Everyone GREETS Buddy. Though obviously not prepared to deal with
this, Sarah gets up and follows Buddy out.

EXT. RUSSELL HOUSE - FRONT YARD - NIGHT

Sarah's car gleams like a newly-minted dime in the harsh glare of
the street lamp.

she walks all around it in wonder. She points to another place on
her car. :

SARAH
You fixed the--

BUDDY
It was no problem. I mean I was
just working away and figured I'd
do it right.

SARAH
Uh-huh.

Buddy can't help but notice sarah's fatigue.

BUDDY
Hey, are you okay?

Sarah looks at Buddy'and knows then and there ... he loves her and
it’s an impossible situation.

SARAH
of course.

She hands him a check with a polite little smile.

SARAH
Thank you, Henry.

Buddy hesitates, unsure why she seems to be giving him the brush-
off.

SARAH
(cold)
I'm sorry, do you need that in cash?

BUDDY
No, this is fine.
(beat)
why do I suddenly want you to call
me Buddy again?

Sarah shrugs. Her cold shoulder is hard to miss, but Buddy tries
anyway. ,
76.

BUDDY
I was gonna see if you wanted to--

SARAH

(interrupting)
t don't think we can do this.

(beat)
I'm seeing someone in the city. We'll
probably be engaged by Christmas. I
just don't want to ... mess anything
up, you know?

Buddy is floored. It takes a moment for him to take it all in.

BUDDY
I see. So somewhere along the line, I
went from being a "romantic" to being
a “mess”. And you just remembered this
“someone” now?

SARAH
Buddy ... you and I had a couple
beers together. That's it.

BUDDY
yeah, sure. I was just--

Buddy doesn't know what he was just--

Angry and frustrated, he turns to leave and remembers that he
drove Sarah's car over. He was obviously going to ask her for a
ride home.

BUDDY
you're right. I guess I let my
imagination get the best of me.
(angry)
or maybe I just imagined what's
best in you.

As Buddy walks down the street heading for home, he misses the
look on Sarah's face. The look that says “Come back".

cur TO:
INT, MORRISEY HOUSE - WORKSHOP
Her hair still wet from a shower, Lorraine watches them from her
screen door. She sees Sarah's look and recognizes it. It's the
look she's been hiding from her own husband for twelve years as
she's pushed him farther and farther away.

some people have soap operas; Lorraine has Sarah and Buddy.
77.

As Lorraine turns from the window, she just catches the tail end
of a conversation in the kitchen.

JON (0.C.)
Sectionals tomorrow, dad. We're
playing Roxana at 4:00.

HOWARD (0.C.)
They still got Harding?

JON (0.C.)
Nah. He graduated, but their new
shortstop’s a demon.

HOWARD (0.C.)
I'll get there as soon as I can.
Try to save the major ass-kicking
for the later innings.

Lorraine smiles and she can almost hear Jon smiling as he replies.

JON (0.C.)
sorry. I kick ass at will. G ‘night.

Jon's face appears in the doorway. He speaks tentatively, unsure
of her mood. He obviously knows better than to invite her to the
game. .

JON
Night, mom.

LORRAINE
Goodnight.

Lorraine sits back down to work. Sarah's box is almost done. After
a moment, Howard appears at the door, watching her work.

HOWARD
(softly)
Hi. I'm going to bed.

Howard walks over to kiss her goodnight. Lorraine hesitates, then
turns the chaste kiss into a real one. Howard breathes in the
scent of her freshly-washed hair and is surprised to find himself
aroused. Lorraine rinses her paintbrush.

LORRAINE
I'll go with you.

Howard is a bit stunned to say the least. He gestures to the box.

HOWARD
Are you done with that?
LORRAINE
For now. Unless you want to stand
here, hold hands and watch the paint
dry.

Howard stares at his wife as if he doesn't quite recognize her.

Slowly and very deliberately, she takes his face in her hands and
kisses him thoroughly.

He tentatively touches her back, trailing his fingers along her
jawline as he kisses her.

They're like teenagers discovering the magic of sexual attraction
for the first time. She leads him inside the house and down the
hall to their bedroom.

INT. MORRISEY HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM

The bed is pleasantly rumpled. Howard lies back and pulis Lorraine
to him tightly. She fits perfectly in the crook of his arm.

HOWARD
God, you feel good. I can't remember-~

He stops himself abruptly.

LORRAINE
Go ahead, say it. The last time we
made love.

HOWARD
No, I remember. I think Reagan was
President.

They laugh and kiss lingeringly.

LORRAINE
Howard, I know sometimes I make you
crazy, but ... you know I still love
you, don't you?
HOWARD
(wicked)

Well, if I didn't before ...

Howard props himself up on an elbow and looks at his wife's face.
He runs a finger down her jawline, seemingly mesmerized by her.

HOWARD
(suddenly serious)
Yeah ... I guess I do.

EXT. STANTON HIGH SCHOOL - BASEBALL DIAMOND

A high school paseball game is in full swing. Jon plays third base
for the Stanton Bulldogs.

EXT. HIGH SCHOOL PARKING LOT

Lorraine gets out of her car and follows the sound of bats
CRACKING against balls and the ROAR of spectators.

EXT. BASEBALL DIAMOND - BLEACHERS

several spectators do doubletakes as Lorraine sits down on the
bleachers. She smiles at them before turning her attention to the
game.

ANGLE ON GAME:

The game is heating up. There's a runner on second as Jon steps up
to bat for Stanton.

He hits a long hard fly to center. The fielder can't get to it.

The runner makes it home as Jon is rounding third. The crowd is

going wild. Lorraine is standing and clapping with the rest of
them.

The ball flies back into the infield and the shortstop snags it.

Jon is trapped between third and home. He turns and seems to have
every intention of returning to third. The COACH there claps his

encouragement.

But then Jon fakes out the shortstop, turning tail as soon as he
throws to third. Jon pulls out all the stops and ... SLIDES into
home as the ball sails to the catcher. It's close. But, the ump
rules "SAFE". The Stanton team members ROAR their approval along
with the home crowd. .

But, Jon isn't basking in the adulation of his team. From the dirt
at home base, he spots Lorraine. He stands up slowly, his amazed
eyes locked with hers.

Lorraine continues to CLAP. Jon slowly smiles as he dusts off his
knees and gives her a tiny wave of acknowledgement. She nods her
head.

ANGLE ON LORRAINE:

Lorraine slowly sits down, energized by the game, being outside,
pleasing her son and just plain living again.

VOICE
Hey lady. Could you make room?
80.

Lorraine looks up to see Howard smiling down at her. Rick is with

LORRAINE
sorry. No room. But maybe ...

Lorraine pats her lap invitingly. Howard LAUGHS as he and Rick
squeeze onto the bleacher seat next to her.

LORRAINE
I'm afraid there's some bad news.

Howard's smile fades. What now?

HOWARD
What?
LORRAINE
our son has been kicking ass without
you.

Lorraine kisses Howard lightly. He takes her hand.
LATER ...-

The game is over. Howard and Rick are heading down to the field to
congratulate Jon. They look back at Lorraine expectantly.

HOWARD
You coming?

LORRAINE
I need to go by the library before
they close. They're holding a book
on Eastern European Folk Art for me.

Howard raises his eyebrows. Huh?

LORRAINE
(cont. )
I need to check the colors for
Sarah's box.
{beat, to Rick)
I was hoping maybe you could drive
me.

Rick hesitates. If this is a test, he's not sure what he's
supposed to say. He looks to Howard, who shrugs.

RICK
I could do that.

LORRAINE
(smiles brightly)
Great.

SMASH CUT TO:

SARAH THROWING UP VIOLENTLY.
INT. PUBLIC RESTROOM

Sarah is bent over the toilet. ‘when she wipes her mouth, we see a
trace of blood.

sarah exits the stall and washes her face at the sink. She pauses
to take a few deep breaths before exiting.

INT. STANTON PUBLIC LIBRARY ~ DAY

As Sarah walks out of the restroom, an elderly MAN looks up from
his reading carrel. He obviously heard her. She catches him
staring at her, but he doesn't look away. Sarah tries to smile
reassuringly, but it just doesn't look right on her too-pale face.

CLOSE ON COMPUTER SCREEN:

Information on leukemia scrolls up on the computerized library
catalogue. Sarah writes down call numbers on a scrap of paper.

AT A TABLE:

Sarah drops several books on a table. She sits down and is quickly
engrossed.

LORRAINE (0.C.)
Well hello.

Sarah SLAMS the book closed and covers it with her backpack as she
turns to see Lorraine standing behind her.

SARAH
Hello.

There is a new tension here. Lorraine assumes it's from their last
encounter. She pulls one of the books out from under the bag.

LORRAINE
What're you reading?
(reading)
Coping With Cancer.

SARAH
Research. one of the essay questions
for my Harvard follow-up. You know ...
what's my chosen area of expertise--
 

82.

Lorraine nods her head as Sarah stops abruptly, nervously
realizing she's giving more information than she needs to.

SARAH
(cont. )
What are you doing here?

Sarah is desperate to deflect attention anywhere else than on her.

LORRAINE
Well, it's research for your box.

sarah starts piling her books together and glances at the door.
Lorraine misinterprets Sarah's nervousness a5 hostility.

LORRAINE
“(cont., ool)
I'm sorry. I wasn't aware this was
your personal library.

Lorraine catches herself and curbs her hostile response.

LORRAINE
(cont. }
Sarah, the last thing I want to do
is fight with you.

Sarah fidgets, increasingly uncomfortable. she quickly gathers up
all of the books and stuffs them in her backpack.

SARAH
I think you were right all along.
This isn't a good idea.

(beat )
I never wanted to make you feel bad.
I'll just send Daniel over to get
the box ... when it's done.

Sarah voice trails off. She zips her backpack ¢losed and leaves
before Lorraine can even reply. Lorraine stares after her,
completely confused.

INT. WILLOUGHBY'S - EVENING

It's still too early for this place to be crowded. Buddy stands up
and motions Daniel over to his table.

BUDDY
Hey ... thanks for coming.

Daniel sits down across from Buddy. They eye each other awkwardly.
oo
DANIEL
So, what's up?
BUDDY
Just thought we could catch up.
Buddy motions to the WAITRESS.
“BUDDY -
can we get a pitcher of Bud?
WAITRESS
can I see some ID?
Buddy and Daniel pull driver's licenses out of their wallets.
The waitress looks at the ID's. As she walks away, Daniel sees
Buddy's old fake license in his wallet and LAUGHS.
DANIEL
' Ah, ye olde fake license. Why haven't
you thrown this away or passed it on
1 to some deserving high schooler?

‘ BUDDY

(taking license)
It's a priceless symbol of my
adolescence.

DANIEL
It's so bad. I still can't figure out
how it worked so well all those years.

BUDDY
How many times do I have to tell you?
Using "Morton" as my first name always
got me sympathy and sympathy made me
less suspicious.

Daniel nods wisely.

DANIEL
As if the name "Buddy" doesn't get
you enough sympathy.

BUDDY
Oooh. Touché.

DISSOLVE TO:

oo A few pitchers later. It’s apparent these guys have gotten drunk
together many times over the years. They pour ‘em and throw ‘em
back with practiced ease.

DANIEL
I dated this one girl, Heidi, last
semester, but then she joined a
sorority and went psycho on me.
Buddy nods as if he knows what that means.

What about you?

Nobody steady.
paniel stares at Buddy unflinchingly.

BUDDY

paniel bursts out LAUGHING. Buddy joins him.

so that's pretty exciting about
Sarah.

DANIEL
Buddy, you find Sarah's right instep
exciting. You're gonna have to be
more specific.
(realizes)
Oh, you mean Harvard.

BUDDY
No ... I meant her being engaged.

Daniel spits out the swallow of beer he just downed and COUGHS.

DANIEL
What ... are you talking about?

BUDDY
You didn't know?

paniel is processing Sarah's strange behavior from the last couple
of days and her evasive answers to his questions. It's all making
sense now. Or at least it seems to.

oo DANIEL
Of course I knew. I just didn't
know you knew ... too. (MORE )
85.

DANIEL (CONT. )
(defensive)
so what else do you want to know
about Sarah? If you print up a
questionnaire , LT could take it home
and ask her to fill it out.

Buddy stands up and almost falls over.

“BUDDY
tr don't know what the hell your
problem is. You're the one who
stopped talking to me.

Daniel attempts to stand up, but weaves in mid-air and sits back
down heavily.

DANIEL
I did not.

seeing that Daniel isn't rising to the challenge, Buddy drops back
down to his own seat.

BUDDY
you just love that you have Sarah
as an excuse to turn it around.

DANIEL

oh, if I've got Sarah, you've got
your dad. You're the one who backed
out of school the day before we
were supposed to leave.

(to himself)
Left me in a fucking empty dorm
room. It was embarrassing.

BUDDY
I told you I couldn't leave my dad
just then. The man had a heart
attack.

. DANIEL
your dad's fine. You were just too
scared to leave.

BUDDY
I was not. He just asked me to wait.

They stare at each other defiantly for a minute, then realization
dawns on Daniel's face.

Buddy throws an envelope with the “university of Illinois" logo on
the table.

Well, I'd prefer you, but ..-

Buddy raises his glass as if to toast.

She rolls her eyes at this.

Sarah pushes the cart to the vegetable section and eyes the carrot
and celery selection.

not deter me from the still-unanswered

question.

SARAH
Glad to hear your rhetoric class
has paid off.

Daniel gives Sarah some intense scrutiny of his own.

You're not getting married. You're
just blowing my best friend off.

SARAH
I'm living my life Daniel. If Buddy

Well, that's the difference between

SARAH
I'm an opti-- I can see the good

the car, but then Phil and Gayle walk out the door and notice

PHIL
Oh shit. Hey everybody ... 1-2-3.

The milling people notice Sarah and try to recover the element of:

EVERYONE
Surprise!

Sarah glares at obvious-accomplice Daniel and tries to smile
brightly.

SARAR
Wow ... this is great.

No it isn't.
EXT. RUSSELL HOUSE - DAY

As Daniel unloads the groceries, Phil and Gayle lead sarah around
to say "hi" to everyone. Sarah is doing a slow boil, but hides it.

SARAH
(aside to Gayle)
Mom, we really should have talked
about this.

GAYLE
Well that would have ruined the
surprise, honey.

PHIL
come on, Sarah. Even you have to
appreciate the comedic irony of
grocery shopping for your own
surprise party.

True enough. The buffet tables are now covered with the party
platters and supplies that Daniel and Sarah bought.

Gayle pulls Sarah aside to speak confidentially.

GAYLE :
Did you and Buddy have a fight? I
had to practically drag him to the
party.

SARAH
Mom, you didn't ...

Hi Sarah.

Sarah turns to face Buddy. He hesitantly hands her a smail gift-

” BUDDY.
No, really. A lot of boaters are
heading up to the lake for the

I gotta sell ‘em gas.

Buddy obviously thinks his gas jockey status contributed to her
rejection of him.

PHIL
Daniel tells me you're joining him
up at U of I in the Fall.

BUDDY
Yeah, I thought I might.

Sarah is surprised by this ... and that Buddy didn't tell her.

Yeah, well ... great.

Goodbye Sarah.

He makes a hasty retreat.

It's later in the day. Sarah is playing a game of jarts with
Daniel, Susan and her husband JEFF. She stops when she sees
Lorraine crossing the street with a determined stride.

SARAH
I'll be back.

Sarah runs to intercept Lorraine, who looks like she's been up all
night. Her gaze bores into Sarah's.

You're sick, aren't you?

Sarah looks around quickly to make sure no one can hear them.

Maybe I'm just pregnant.

No, you're not gonna have any kids,

I'm fine. Just leave me alone.

LORRAINE
Headaches, backaches, dizziness.
Probably worse symptoms you're not
gonna tell me about.

Sarah stays silent.

LORRAINE
(realizing)
You haven't told anyone, have you?

Sarah stares at the grass at her feet.

SARAH
It's leukemia.

Sarah seems relieved that someone else finally knows. Lorraine
nods, simultaneously satisfied and horrified that her suspicions
are confirmed.

LORRAINE
Why on earth would you want to go
through something like this alone?

norraine's confusion turns into yet another realization.

LORRAINE
(cont. )
Sarah ... you can't think that you
deserve this.

The compassion in Lorraine's voice is too much. Sarah's eyes are
welling up with tears. But she can't let herself break down in
front of everyone.

SARAH
(willing her to stop)
Lorraine, I can‘t do this ... now.

But, Lorraine can't let it go.

LORRAINE

you do think you deserve it, don't
you?

sarah's eyes meet Lorraine's. That's exactly what she thinks.
The tension is broken when Phil TAPS a glass loudly.

PHIL
Hey! Can I have your attention for
a minute.

The crowd quiets down. As Daniel walks over and pulls her towards
Phil, Sarah's eyes swear Lorraine to secrecy.

Phil drapes his arm around Sarah proudly.

PHIL
First of all, thanks to everyone for
coming by and helping us celebrate.

Gayle steps out of the house with a plate of burgers for the
grill. She quickly puts it down and joins Phil and Sarah.

since Sarah's mother and I believe
that nothing but the best will do,
we're sending her to Harvard. There
will be sacrifices ... we'll be moving
into our son Daniel's dorm and selling
our house so if anyone wants to make a
bid today, just talk to Gayle.

The crowd LAUGHS on cue.

Daniel finishes telling Sarah a joke as they walk in the front
door.

INT. KITCHEN

Gayle is hanging up the phone with a devastated expression on her
face as Lorraine walks in from the back door.

LORRAINE
Gayle, Phil wanted me to tell you
he needs more ice--

She stops. when she sees the look on Gayle's face.

Daniel and Sarah are still LAUGHING at the punchline to his joke
when they enter the kitchen from the other direction. Gayle looks
at them with tears in her eyes.

DANIEL
Mom, what is it?

Gayle is staring at Sarah, who is conspicuously silent.

GAYLE :
Why don't you ask your sister?

Daniel looks from Gayle to Sarah, clueless. Sarah glares at
Lorraine in disbelief.

SARAH
(to Lorraine)
What gives you the right--

GAYLE
(interrupting)
Carla just called. You got another
important phone call ... from a Dr.
Gordon.

The dam of Gayie's grief and anger bursts.

GAYLE
(loud)
What the hell kind of game are you
playing Sarah? I mean, what were you

gonna do ... just die in your room?
Let me find out later that you were
sick?

“DANIEL

Mom, she was just--

Gayle turns on Daniel angrily.

GAYLE
She's got leukemia, Daniel ... and
I guess she just didn't feel like

telling us.
Daniel turns to stare at Sarah, hoping she will deny it.

DANIEL
Sarah ...?

sarah wishes she could just disappear into the linoleum. Finally:

SARAH
(evenly)
It sounds like you got the full
report, Mom. I'd appreciate it if
you didn't announce it to the party
guests.

Gayle stares at Sarah in shock, amazed by her emotionless tone.
Then more tumblers click into place as she looks at Lorraine and
realizes that she knew.

GAYLE
(incredulous)
You couldn’t teil your own mother,
but you told her?

LORRAINE
(softly)
I... figured it out.

Though it isn't there, Gayle hears another accusation -- why
didn't she pick up on the signs and figure it out?

GAYLE
{to Sarah)
Are you trying to hurt me?
95.

Gayle's tears start up again as she crosses the floor and hugs her
daughter tightly.

GAYLE
(muffled)
Don't ... don't.

We're not sure what Gayle is telling Sarah not to do. Don't hurt
her? Don't die? Sarah pats her mother's back and locks eyes with
Lorraine. This is why she didn't want to tell anyone.

curT TO:
INT. DR. GORDON'S OFFICE - DAY
Phil, Gayle, Daniel and Sarah sit in Dr. Gordon's office.

SARAH (V.0.)
I persuaded my mother not to tell
anyone about my illness, but had to
agree to go back to Dr. Gordon ...
who really didn't have anything new
to say.

Dr. Gordon has just finished explaining the results of Sarah's
tests in layman's terms.

GAYLE
So ... what do we do now? Is there
treatment? Chemotherapy? What?

Sarah barely appears to be listening to this discussion about her
future. Dr. Gordon is baffled by her behavior. He has to
deliberately pull his attention back to Gayle.

DR. GORDON
yes, of course. We have an excellent
chemo program. Once the disease goes
into remission, depending on the
patient's status, we look at the
options: radiotherapy, bone marrow
transplant, an umbilical cord blood
trans--

Dr. Gordon stops abruptly and looks at Sarah. He turns to Phil and
Gayle.

DR. GORDON
May I speak to you two outside?

pr. Gordon leads a confused Phil and Gayle into the hall.

pr. Gordon can't contain his curiosity.

DR. GORDON
It just hit me that ..- Sarah doesn't
seem to care whether she lives or
dies. Can you shed any light?

‘GAYLE -
(outraged)
What? Doesn't ca--

DR. GORDON

(interrupting)
Mrs. Russell, there's no time here
for hurt feelings or indignation. I'm
sorry, but you have to be frank with
me. Sarah may need a psychiatrist as
well ag a doctor right now.

(beat)
Has she been acting strangely?
Depressed, suicidal, feelings of rage,
guilt, hopelessness?

pie GAYLE
Well, she doesn't really--
(glances at Phil)
Sarah's always been a quiet girl.

Phil ignores Gayle's look.
PHIL
Dr. Gordon, Sarah hasn't always
been the way she is.

Phil hesitates. He doesn‘t want to go into this, but he knows it's
important. Dr. Gordon nods for him to continue.

PHIL

was babysitting for the family

across the street ..-

EXT, GATEWOOD CEMETARY — DAY

Howard leads Lorraine to a small rose-colored marker stone. She's
obviously never been to Jennifer's grave. It reads:

JENNIFER RAE MORRISEY
“Beloved Daughter & sister"
Born: 5/21/83
pied: 6/3/84

They stand looking down at it for several moments. Lorraine bends

and places some tea roses at the marker. Her hand lingers on the
sun-warmed granite. As she stands her knees POP loudly.

Lorraine's eyes scan the surrounding ‘countryside. It's a lovely
view of rolling hills and a nearby orchard.

LORRAINE
you found her a really nice spot,
Howard.

HOWARD
Mmm- hmmm.

LORRAINE
I guess I wasn't much help at the

Howard stays silent. His look tells her he doesn’t blame her for
anything. She takes his hand as they walk back to the car.

pull into the driveway.

Howard glances at Lorraine. He knows she's getting better, but

Lorraine turns to give him a kiss.

Lorraine gets out of the car and Howard backs out of the driveway.

Lorraine walks up the gidewalk as Sarah turns.

SARAH

Now that we got you out, I can never

tentative smile of her own.

It's good to be out.

EXT. PARK - CONCESSION STAND - LATE AFTERNOON

Sarah and Lorraine turn from the concession stand window with snow

cones. They sit on a picnic table with their feet up on the bench.

A group of pre-teen GIRLS walk by, all carefully dressed and
coiffed to resemble each other.

Lorraine and Sarah are silent, enjoying crushed ice and peace.

LORRAINE
you know, Jennifer would've turned
thirteen last week.

I keep trying to imagine what she
would look like. It's so easy to look
back at baby pictures and see the
people they've become. But, without
a point of reference ..-

Sarah takes a deep preath, relieved that the subject is no longer
taboo.

SARAH
She was beautiful.

LORRAINE
... she just got stuck in my mind. A
baby. Then I try again and I picture
myself at thirteen. Boy, did I hate the
way I looked.

SARAE
Everyone hates the way they look at
that age. At least every girl.

iorraine glances at Sarah's profile then at the girls as they
disappear around a corner.

LORRAINE
Lately, when I try to see Jennifer,
T've been picturing you ... the way
you were the night it happened. So
young trying to be so adult.

SARAH
... and so responsible.

Lorraine hears it in Sarah's voice -- years of guilt and self-
recrimination. She realizes she's just been pouring the salt of
her own sorrow on Sarah's emotional wounds.

LORRAINE
you're not responsible Sarah.

Sarah doesn't respond. Lorraine turns to see tears in her eyes
that she just won't let fall.

LORRAINE

You never were.

Sarah finally cries. Lorraine holds her.
LORRAINE

The only thing you're responsible
for is saving my life.

SARAH
What?
LORRAINE
You gave it back to me.
(frustrated)

So just don't be so eager to give
yours up without a fight.

SARAH
But I don't know what to do. I
don't know what I'm doing.

LORRAINE -
Sarah, just promise me one thing. If
you want to get through this, you're
gonna have to accept some help ...
and let some people get close and
let yourself off the hook.

It's obvious that Lorraine is speaking from experience.

Sarah enters the station and approaches Ray, who snoozes in a
leather chair.

Well, hey Sarah. I don't really
know if he's here. To tell the
truth, I was takin' a littie nap.

You need some gas pumped? Maybe a
dent fixed?

Sarah narrows her eyes at the veiled accusation in Ray's voice.

SARAH
Mr. Carroll. I don't want you to
think that I ... don't care--

RAY

Ain't too many other ways to look (MORE)
103.

RAY (CONT. )

from a girl you--

Ray stops himself, realizing he's talking too much.

SARAH
Buddy's a ... really nice guy.

RAY

You bet he is.

(beat)
Ten years ago, he came in that same
doorway you're standing in. I'd
never seen him so excited. He was
talkin' so fast I caught about one
word in five. But, one of the ones
I kept catchin' was Sarah ... Sarah ...
Sarah.

Unseen by either Ray or Sarah, Buddy almost walks in from the back
of the garage. He quickly steps back into the lengthening shadows
when he hears them.

ON BUDDY'S FACE:

RAY (0.C.)
Now remember this was the boy who'd
give his Matchbox cars away if another
kid didn't have none. Or his comics
or his baseball cards. He was generous
to a fault.

(beat)

But, the way he said your name ... I
knew if he had ya he'd never let you
go. And the way he'd treat ya, you'd
never wanna leave,

A wave of emotion washes over Buddy's face. Corny as the
expression of it may be, every word his father says is true.

ON RAY:

RAY

(shrugs)
Maybe I was readin‘ a bit much into
the ramblin's of an eleven year old.

Sarah is speechless. Ray suddenly realizes how much he's said.

RAY
And I know I definitely talk too
much, You want me to tell him you
came by?
104.

SARAH .
Tell him I'm going away and I'm--

ON BUDDY:

It's obvious Buddy wants to go into the next room and sweep Sarah
off her feet.

SARAH (0.C.)
I'm not sure when I'll be back.

But, her words just sound like another rejection to hin.

INT. SARAH'S CAR

Sarah takes deep breaths to control her runaway emotions, but it's
a losing battle.

INT. RAY'S SUNOCO

Ray is neither startled nor surprised when Buddy walks in from the
back.

RAY
Didja catch all that?

BUDDY
I think I caught it the first time
she told me to fuck off.

Ray sits up angrily.

RAY

Hey! What do I got to do? When did
it get so hard for people to just
come out and say somethin’? You two
care about each other. That's more
than most people start with.

(frustrated)
If you'd just get past your stupid
soap opera posturin' and say two
words to each other.

BUDDY
Dad, what am I supposed to think?
What am I supposed to say? She told
me she's getting engaged at Christmas.

 
105.

RAY
Son, I don't know what she told ya
but she came here. Now. To see you.
(flustered)
A moron could see this!

Buddy wants to believe but can't let himself.
.-BUDDY

I don't know. She must get some
strange pleasure from torturing me.

RAY
No more than you get from torturin'
yourself.
(finally)

You didn't see her face, Buddy.

Buddy finally looks directly at his father. Slowly, he nods.
BUDDY
(softly)
Okay ... okay, dad.
CUT TO:

INT. RUSSELL HOUSE -. SARAH'S ROOM
Sarah runs in and closes the door behind her. There is a half-
packed open suitcase sitting on the floor. Sarah begins rapidly
folding clothes and placing them in the suitcase.

A KNOCK is heard at her door. Sarah looks up, a glimmer of hope in
her eyes.

GAYLE (V.0.)
Sarah ... you okay?

SARAH
I'm fine, mom.

Sarah starts throwing toiletries from her dresser into a smaller
duffel bag. She pauses when she notices a small wrapped PACKAGE.

Sarah realizes it's the gift Buddy gave her at the party.
Slowly, she sinks to the bed and undoes the wrapping.

A small velvet jewel box reveals its treasure: a ring of solid
burnished pewter, finely wrought with a simple scrollwork design.

Sarah covers her mouth with her hand, amazed by the beautiful
gift. She notices a card’and opens it.
106.

The card reads: “Dear Sarah, Congratulations. Don't worry, it's
just a friendship ring. This wasn't meant to be a last minute
‘Going Away To Med School’ gift and it won't be the kind of
wedding gift I wanted it to be, Did I just write that? Now I
definitely have to rip this card up. Yours, Buddy”

But, he didn't rip the card up.

‘BUDDY (0.C.)
It was my mother's.

Startled, Sarah looks up and sees Buddy standing in the doorway.

SARAH
Your mother's friendship ring?

BUDDY
(reluctant admission)
Her wedding ring. It's passed down
through the women in my family, but
.+. I don't have a sister.

Buddy walks in and sits down on the bed next to Sarah.

SARAH
So she trusted your judgment? About
the woman to give it to?

BUDDY
(nods)
Even then I was wise beyond my years.

Encouraged by Sarah's words, Buddy throws caution to the wind. He
takes the ring out of the velvet box and moves to put it on
Sarah's finger.

SARAH
Buddy, I have to tell you something.

BUDDY
(a question/plea)
You're not getting married to this
guy from Chicago ...

Buddy trails off, hoping against hope she's not going to destroy
him with a word.

SARAH
No.

Buddy smiles his relief and slips the ring on Sarah's finger. His
gaze is direct and his voice is sure as he proposes.
107.

BUDDY
Then marry me.

Sarah is shocked. After a moment, she realizes she wants to say
“yes”, but can't. Still ... she needs hin.

SARAH
Can you just ... stay?

INT. ST. MARY'S HOSPITAL - SARAH'S ROOM - MORNING

Sarah is in a hospital bed. As she wakes up, she notices a roomful
of people around her: Phil, Gayle, Daniel, Dr. SHELLY WINTHROP ...
and Buddy.

DR. WINTHROP
Good morning Sarah.

Sarah has obviously undergone the first stages of chemotherapy.
Her hair has thinned, but hasn't all fallen out. It's pulled back
in tiny tortoiseshell barrettes.
SARAH
(weak)
Hi.

Phil, Gayle and Daniel AD LIB “hello"'s.

SARAH
Bey, Buddy.

Needless to say, Buddy knows everything ... and he's still here.

BUDDY
Hi.

Dr. Winthrop, an effervescent woman in her early 40's, examines
Sarah carefully, checking her vitals and marking her chart while
keeping up a cheerful line of patter.
108.

DR. WINTHROP
(Joking)
Well lucky for you Sarah, we got
the license number of the semi that
hit you.

SARAH
I thought it was radiation.

DR. WINTHROP
Okay, you tell me. What does it
feel like?

SARAH
(laughing)
Like a ten-ton truck.

Everyone wants to laugh, but they keep glancing at Dr. Winthrop
and her chart, desperately waiting for confirmation that
everything will be okay.

GAYLE
(anxiously)
So ... did it work?

DR. WINTHROP
We'll know by tomorrow.

SARAH
i've been here six weeks and you
still can't tell me if I'm getting
better?

DR. WINTHROP
Sarah, you just finished an intensive
program. The effect is cumulative.
Yesterday's treatment was your
strongest yet and hopefully ... it's
sent you into remission.

Sarah looks at the anxious faces hovering over her.
SARAH (V.0.)
This is just what I wanted to avoid.
A sea of worried, smiling faces.

Sarah sits in a comfortable overstuffed chair talking to a
pleasant-looking middle-aged psychiatrist, DR. PAUL VITALE.

SARAH (V.0.)
I should have known fixing me
physically wouldn't be enough. My
parents insisted I talk to the
psychiatrist that Dr. Gordon
recommended. I don't know why
they think talking to a stranger
is going to help me when I can't
even talk to my. family.

cur TO:

INT. DR. VITALE'S OFFICE - DAY
Dr. Vitale now talks to Phil and Gayle.

DR. VITALE
Sarah has been repressing so many
feelings for so long she doesn't
know what she should be feeling now.
That's why she didn't want to tell
you about her illness. She knew
you'd respond with an outpouring of
emotion and she knew she wouldn't
be able to handle it.

His VOICEOVER continues over the following:

cuT TO:
INT. ST. MARY'S HOSPITAL - SARAH'S ROOM

Sarah's room is dark. She's asleep, but tosses restlessly under
the thin hospital sheet.

Gayle is slumped in a bedside chair, more asleep than awake.

DR. VITALE (V.0.)
Before the accident, you said she
was a bright outgoing young girl.
Afterwards, she took refuge in her
guilt. She was a loner in high school.
Introverted in the extreme.

Lorraine appears in the doorway of the dark room, backlit by the
bright hallway fluorescents. She gazes at Sarah's restless form
for a few minutes.

DR. VITALE (V.0.)
(cont. )
Sarah has been turned off from her
emotions like a child whose brain is
disconnected from his nerve endings. (MORE)
110.

DR. VITALE (V.0., CONT.)
Just like that child can't feel a
physical touch of any sort, Sarah ~
hasn't been able to feel an emotional
touch from anyone around her.

Lorraine steps further into the room and we see that she is
carrying her heirloom quilt -- the beautifully-stitched patchwork
one. She gently drapes it over Sarah.
DR. VITALE (V.0.)
(cont. )

Her detachment isn't a personal attack

on you, she just couldn't feel anyone

trying to get through ... until now.
Lorraine places her cool hand on Sarah's forehead.

Gayle wakes with a start as if the hand was pressed against her
own brow. She sees Lorraine and the two lock eyes.

Mother to mother.
Seeing that Sarah is okay, Gayle closes her eyes again.

Sarah's restless movements slow and eventually stop, but she
doesn't wake. Lorraine watches a moment longer then leaves.

cur TO:
INT. BUDDY'S TRUCK

Buddy drives as Sarah sits in the passenger seat, wrapped in
Lorraine's quilt.

BUDDY
(gently)
You okay?
Sarah doesn't reply.
BUDDY

Come on Sarah. The doctor said full
remission. That's great, right?

SARAH
(distant)
I guess. I don't know, Buddy. I'm
not a doctor.
(bitter laugh)
And I suppose I never will be.

She sounds like she couldn't care less. Buddy sounds like he
couldn't care more. It's a frustrating combination.
lll.

Buddy suddenly pulls to the side of the road and shuts off the
engine. Sarah simply stares out the front windshield.

BUDDY
Sarah, I've been trying to have the
patience of a saint for six weeks.
I mean--
(frustrated)
You let me propose and you couldn't
even tell me you were sick.

As he speaks, Sarah gets a steely look in her eyes and removes the
pewter ring from her finger. She‘s lost some weight and it slips
off too easily and falls onto the seat between them.

BUDDY
(cont. )
You know I'd do anything. Why didn't
you just tell--

SARAH
(angry) .
That's why! I know you'd do anything.
I know it! I also know I've never
done anything to deserve that ...
kind of ...

Sarah can't finish the sentence. Buddy retrieves the ring.

BUDDY

Love, Sarah. That's the word you're
looking for. It's a funny thing. It
doesn't matter if you don't feel you
deserve it. People are gonna love
you and want to help you through this.

(beat)
I want to.

Sarah looks up at him. She's got a lot of questions, but doesn't
seem to know how to put any of them into words. Finally ...

SARAH
Buddy, why would you ask me to marry
you? Even if I wasn't sick? As far as
you knew, I was going to Harvard.
You're gonna be a goddamn undergrad
in the Fall:

BUDDY
Those are just details.
 

ile.

SARAH
Did I ever treat you well or give you
any indication ... You and Daniel used
to drive me insane. You said it yourself.
I lied to you! About my illness, about
my engagement. Why would you--

Once again, she stops herself before she can say “love me".

Buddy won't let Sarah change the subject with the force of her
anger. He makes her look him in the eye.

BUDDY
Do you love me Sarah?

Sarah looks away, unable to hold his gaze.
SARAH
It wouldn't matter if I did. It
doesn't change anything.
BUDDY
Forget changing things. I could
die of an aneurysm tomorrow. You
could live for another forty years.

After what seems like forever, Sarah finds the voice to answer.

SARAH
Yes.

She pulls the quilt from around her shoulders and rubs it against
her cheek.

INT. MORRISEY HOUSE - DAY

The doorbell is RINGING. A hand reaches into frame and opens the
door. Sarah stands outside holding the heirloom quilt.

ON SARAH:

She is surprised to see Jon Morrisey. They stare at each other for
a moment. He's grown about three feet since she saw him last.

SARAH
Jon? Or is it Rick?

JON

gon. Hi.

He motions for her to come in.

SARAH
Thanks. Is your mom here?

JON
Yeah, she's in her workshop.

He motions for her to enter. As she walks by him, he stops her
with a tentative touch.

JON
Are you ... okay?

SARAH

I'm great. How are you doing?

JON

Better.

Jon isn't sure if he needs to elaborate, but Sarah's smile says
she knows exactly what he means.

The “OOH's" and "AAH's” of the crowd fill the quiet intervals

track of time in the hospital.

LORRAINE

SARAH
Well ... they say I'm in remission.
LORRAINE
Why do you say that like it's a

Sarah looks at Lorraine closely. Though her tone is light, the
words are sincere.

CUP TO;
EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT

Sarah has the folded quilt under her arm. she and Lorraine walk
down their street.

LORRAINE
Did you take my advice?

Sarah is momentarily puzzled.

LORRAINE
(softly)
About letting yourself off the hook?

SARAH
I want to, but ... it's kind of tough
to let go of something that's been
keeping you going for so long.

LORRAINE
Guilt isn't a lifeline, sarah. I used
it to tie my family in knots and I
came awfully close to losing them
without even noticing.

SARAH
Well except for Daniel, I've never
really been that close to my family
anyway ...
116.

LORRAINE
Are you sure about that?
(beat)
I think you and I are a lot alike.
After Jennifer died, we both shut
down. I just got older, but you--

Lorraine stops herself as the full impact of what sarah must have
gone through begins to come clear.

LORRAINE
(cont. )
You were still growing up and .
learning how to live.

SARAH
. (bitterly)
Or not learning.

LORRAINE
I just mean you seemed to be enjoying
life before ... it happened. Maybe
you need to remember how.

SARAH
(defensively)
I am.
LORRAINE
I'm glad. —
(beat)

He's really cute, you know.
SARAH
On that note -- which I refuse to let
become a full-fledged conversation --
I'm out of here.
Sarah and Lorraine separate, each walking to her own house.

SARAE
Hey!

Lorraine jumps, slightly startled as she turns back.

SARAH
Thanks. You know, for the quilt.

Lorraine's look says “You're welcome". For everything.

INT. RUSSELL HOUSE - SARAH'S ROOM
Sarah sits on her bed, looking through an old photo album.
CLOSE ON A SERIES OF PHOTOS:

- Sarah at 14, paper-thin, preparing for her first day of high
school. :

~ 16-year-old Sarah at Christmas, off by herself, watching others
opening presents.

7 17-year-old Sarah as "Valedictorian" addressing her senior class
at graduation.

GAYLE (0.C.)
I remember when you went up to
that podium.

Sarah is startled as she looks up and sees her mom standing over
her shoulder. Gayle sits down next to Sarah.

GAYLE
(cont. )
You were so nervous. Terrified. we
didnt know if you were actually
going to be able to get any words
out.

SARAH
I remember ...

. GAYLE
But, then you pulled it off with
such finesse. You could always fool
us Sarah. .
(beat)
How was I supposed to know you were
hurting?

Sarah is uncomfortable. She and her mother do not discuss things
like this.

SARAH
(coldly)
Is this line of questioning the
result of your meeting with pr.
Vitale?

GAYLE
Don't be angry.
(rethinks)
Or be angry if you want, but just
don't hold it in.
118.

SARAH
Mom, there's no reason for me to
be angry or for you to feel guilty.

GAYLE
Sarah, your father and I were wrong
to ignore what happened.

Sarah stands, anxious to end this conversation.

SARAH
You weren't. You were just taking
your cue from me.

GAYLE
And then I probably latched onto the
Harvard idea so strongly because it
was an easy fix -- something I could
get excited about without having to
look too closely.

SARAH
Please. Don't try to analyze me or
us or ... this whole damn thing.

GAYLE
Honey, don‘t shut me out--

Sarah interrupts her softly but firmly. She can't take much more.
SARAH
(softly)
Can you just go ... now...

Gayle stands up, desperate to say the right thing, but she doesn't
know what that is. She goes.

CUT TO:
INT. RUSSELL KITCHEN - EVENING

Gayle is standing at the sink, peeling potatoes, staring out the
kitchen window into the back yard. Tears glisten in her eyes.

Silently, Sarah enters the kitchen, opens the refrigerator and
gets a Coke. She heads back to her room, but pauses in the
doorway.

Sarah sets the Coke on the counter and wraps her arms around her
mother's waist, resting her head on her back. Gayle stops Peeling
the potatoes and turns to hug her daughter.

INT. ST. MARY'S - SARAH'S ROOM ‘

Sarah lies in her familiar hospital bed watching a movie. She is
flanked on either side by Buddy and Daniel. Lorraine's quilt
covers them and adds life to the drab roon.

ON THE TV SCREEN: The Sunday matinee movie is on. It's MARATHON
MAN. Laurence Olivier is practicing his torturous dentistry on
Dustin Hoffman.

Daniel, Sarah and Buddy all cringe sympathetically.

DANIEL
So they tell me that this bone
marrow donation involves some of
the most exquisite pain around for
both parties.

Buddy starts switching channels.

BUDDY
Maybe we can find a ballgame.

SARAH
(to Daniel) .
Are you just nervous or are you
trying to back out?

DANIEL
Did you see the size of the needle
they're going to stick in my butt?

SARAH
Your hip.

DANIEL
Let's try again ... did you see
the size of the needle?

BUDDY
He's just scared shitless.

DANIEL
Joke. I'm kidding. They've just
taken so much blood out of me, I'm
permanently light-headed.

(to Sarah)

You know I'd give up a testicle-—
(rethinks)

Well, I'd give up a finger--
(hesitates)

I'd definitely give up an earlobe

for you.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
SARAH
I'm touched ... I think.
A NURSE walking by in the corridor outside pauses at their open
door and glares at Daniel. :

NURSE
How many times do I have to tell
you-- .
Daniel stands up sheepishly when he notices,
DANIEL
(to nurse)
Okay, okay, I'm going back into

solitary, but this treatment is
inhuman I tell you.

INT. OPERATING ROOM
Dr. Winthrop supervises the Operation to remove Daniel's bone
marrow. Daniel lies on his Stomach and cringes as a giant needle
injects him with a spinal anaesthetic.

cur To:
INT. CHEMOTHERAPY CHAMBER

Sarah is receiving her final gigantic dose of radiation in an
effort to destroy all the cells in her bone marrow.

CUT TO:
INT. OPERATING ROOM

Sarah looks worse than we have ever seen her. Unfortunately, she
has to come to the verge of death to have a chance for life,

Dr. Winthrop directs the large needles which insert Daniel's
healthy bone marrow into sarah's bones,

INT. ISOLATION CHAMBER

Sarah is asleep in a hypoallergenic hospital room. She looks
extremely small and defenseless in the sea of downy white hospital
linens.

INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE ISOLATION CHAMBER

Phil, Gayle, Buddy and Daniel look in on her. pr, Winthrop walks
up to them. She looks tired, but tries to smile reassuringly.

GAYLE
Can we go see her?

DR. WINTHROP
I'm really sorry, but this is a
critical time. It'll be a week or
two before we know if Sarah's body
will take the new marrow. Until then
she has to be isolated.

CLOSE ON: SARAH'S FACE IN THE ISOLATION CHAMBER

It's peaceful for perhaps the first time in a decade.

SARAH (V.0.)
So I finally realize that maybe I
do want to spend some time with
Some people and they put me in an
isolation chamber. Another little
cosmic irony.

DISSOLVE To:
SUPERIMPOSE: SIX WEEKS LATER ...
EXT. GREEN FIELD
Soft piano MUSIC plays as the CAMERA slowly moves across a
beautiful ineredibly-green hillside. the view looks like the vista
visible from Gatewood Cemetary.
A quiet SOBBING is heard as we see ... a handkerchief dabbing at
tears on the face of a large woman. It's Gladys, the woman
Lorraine restored the mother-of-pearl box for.
CLOSE ON: BUDDY

Dressed in a black suit. His face is unusually solemn,
122.

The monotone drone of a PRIEST can be heard faintly. There is a
pause, then ... :

Buddy turns te Sarah. she's there. She's alive,
And she's dressed in white. He lifts a small veil and kisses her.

They turn to face the small congregation, which includes the
RUSSELL's, the MORRISEY's and a beaming Mr. Carroll.

LORRAINE squeezes Howard's hand as she watches Sarah with the
pride of a mother.

CLOSE ON: SARAH

She's dressed in a simple white lace dress and her hair. is getting
thicker, curling around her face becomingly.

The operation was obviously Successful. As she turns to look at
Buddy, we see that the ever-present bewilderment and uncertainty
are gone,

The priest takes Buddy and Sarah's hands and joins them for all to
see as he pronounces:

PRIEST
I would like to present Mr. and mrs.
Henry Carroll.

An upbeat recessional begins as Buddy and sarah run down the
aisle. Martine, Carla, Susan, Jeff and Daniel pelt them with rice.

CUT TO:
INT. WEDDING RECEPTION - pay

The reception is in full swing. People are drinking, laughing,
dancing.

Sarah and Buddy are Opening gifts. Lorraine hands an elegant
Package to Sarah. She rips off the paper like a 5-year-old on
Christmas morning.

SARAH (V.0.)
Okay, so maybe my life isn't so
random. I'm Starting to see the
order in the chaos.

It's her finished box. Lorraine has worked her Magic. The box
looks ancient, but delicately weathered as if with an inner glow.
The painting on the top is newly-refreshed with color. New life.

Sarah hugs Lorraine then turns to show Buddy.

I don't expect to live forever ...
but I've been wrong before.
