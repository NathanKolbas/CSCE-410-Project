EXT - COACHING INN - DAY 1
A coach-and-horses wait outside an ancient coaching Inn.

A chest - with “Thomas Brown Esquire” etched in shiny new gold -
is thrown up onto the coach.

TOM BROWN’S SCHOOLDAYS

CUT TO:

INT - COACHING INN - DAY 2

SQUIRE BROWN looks at his watch, sees that the moment of
departure is approaching.

His son, TOM, stands before him, nervous but excited, suddenly
looking very young to be sent away.

SQUIRE
Remember what you promised. Write to
your mother every week and say your
prayers every night.

TOM
Yes, father.

The Squire looks down at his son and his heart softens. He
squats down with the pretence of fixing Tom’s collar.

SQUIRE
(Gentle)

If schools are anything like what they
were in my time you’1ll see a great
many cruel and blackguard things done.
But never fear, Tom. Learn from the
strong, protect the weak, stand up to
bullies and blackguards of every kind,
and you’1l turn out a man to be proud
of.

TOM
I’ll try, father.

The COACHMAN comes into the Inn.

COACHMAN
Any more for Rugby? Last call.

SQUIRE
That’s you, my boy.

SQUIRE
Good luck, Tom.

They shake hands.

CUT TO:

EXT - COACHING INN - DAY 3
Tom is helped up next to the Coachman as the Squire looks on.

The whip cracks and the coach lurches forward, Tom looking
bravely ahead.

As it pulls away up the road his courage leaves him for a moment
and he turns to see the reassuring figure of his father waving
back at him.

Tom waves back. Then turns to face the front and the rest of his
life.

The coach rattles off into the countryside.
The Squire watches until the coach is out of sight.

CUT TO:

INT - RUGBY SCHOOL/ARNOLD’S HOUSE/DINING ROOM - DAY 4

In a large, rambling house next to the school the Arnold Family
are making themselves at home in their new house.

MARY ARNOLD - an attractive, intelligent woman in her thirties -
overseas some WORKMEN as they put up paintings on the empty
walls.

The Arnold CHILDREN unpack books or play, all aged under ten,
including the young MATTHEW Arnold.

THOMAS ARNOLD comes into the room. He is in his thirties, trying
to look serious when in fact he’s feeling extremely nervous.

ARNOLD *
Where shall I put Thucydides?

Mary sees that Arnold is distracted.
MARY
(Kind)

Why don’t I make us some tea? Settle
your nerves.

ARNOLD
(Lying)
I’m not nervous. Not nervous at all.

Mary fusses over his collar, adjusts his gown, whispers in his
ear.

MARY
You will be the greatest headmaster
this school has ever seen.
She kisses him.
Arnold smiles but his nerves are still obvious.
MARY
Why don’t you go and inspect your new
empire?

He looks out of his window at the boys milling below.

CUT TO:

EXT - RUGBY/OUTSKIRTS - DAY 5
The coach rattles towards Rugby.

Tom is excited now, straining forward to catch his first glimpse
of the town.

Suddenly, three urchin BOYS break cover and start pelting the
coach with rotten fruit and vegetables and eggs.

Tom is astonished, just lets the eggs and fruit splatter against
his new suit.

 

CUT TO:
EXT - RUGBY SCHOOL/QUAD/COLLONADE - DAY 6 *
Thomas Arnold walks across the quad, an imposing man striding *
through his new World. *
The hustle and bustle of arriving boys is stilled for a moment *
as the Headmaster moves through them. *

EXT - RUGBY SCHOOL - DAY 8
Rugby School looms imposingly.

There is a buzz of energy as boys meet each other again at the
start of term.

The coach rattles away, leaving a nervous Tom Brown and his
luggage alone in his new surroundings.

A bell sounds somewhere in the great school and dozens of BOYS
of all ages and shapes start pushing into the school, fighting
and playing and shouting.

It is an intimidating, lonely moment for Tom.

EAST
I say, you fellow, is your name Brown?

Tom turns to look at East, who surveys the dishevelled new boy
with something approaching contempt.

TOM
Yes, it is.

EAST
My name’s East. I’ve got some ancient
Aunt in your part of the country and
she said I was to look after you.

TOM
Thank you.

EAST
Don’t thank me, it’1l be worth half a
sovereign at least come Christmas.

East looks at Tom’s egg-spattered clothes.

EAST
Good God, man, what happened to you?

TOM

Some boys attacked the coach just
outside of town.

EAST
Bloody louts. Did you see them off?

TOM
No.

East just looks at Tom with weary resignation.

EAST
Come on, I’1l show you around.

With that East swaggers off towards the school gates, leaving
Tom to pick up all of his luggage himself and hurry after his
new friend.

EAST
Let me give you a bit of advice,
Brown. A great deal depends on how a
fellow cuts up at first. If he is
straightforward and holds his head up
and shows no fear -

Suddenly East drags the startled Tom out of sight.

They watch as a magnificent peacock of a young man of seventeen -
waistcoat a riot of silk and colour; hair swept back in the
fashion; impeccable, dandy suit; silver-topped cane - swaggers
by with a sneer on his face. FLASHMAN.

Small boys give him a wide, watchful birth, like a shark in a
lagoon.

TOM
Who is that?

EAST
Flashman.

TOM

Why are you afraid of him?

EAST
You’1l find out, soon enough.

Whose horses are these?

Who wants to know?

ARNOLD
The Headmaster of Rugby School wants
to know.

The Groom hurriedly removes his cap.
GROOM

Some of the boys, sir, do keep ‘em for
the steeplechasing over at Dunchurch.

ARNOLD
(Astonished)
They gamble on them?
GROOM
Oh Lord yes, sir. Love their gambling,
the boys do.

The sound of dogs barking alerts Arnold to an entire pack of
Beagle dogs in an enclosed barn. We do not see the dogs.

GROOM
And their hunting.

East continues his tour of Rugby School.

This is the place for fights. That...

The Headmaster? Haven’t seen him yet,

Suddenly Arnold looms before them. *

Tom just stares at his dark, brooding presence before East grabs
Tom by the collar and drags him away.

CUT TO:

INT - RUGBY SCHOOL/CORRIDOR/STUDY - DAY 11

Arnold walks down a corridor. Boys fly in all directions at his
approach.

There is no gas or electric light in the Rugby School of this *
day so it’s interiors by day will be dark and dusty, and by *
night black, illuminated only by candles and fires. *
He pulls chunks of damp plaster from the unloved walls.

One of the study doors is ajar and Arnold pushes it open, just
as a boy dives out of the open window.

Arnold enters the study, picks up a battered text book, glances
at it.

With a severe frown he notices a pipe still smoking on the
window-sill.

He then notices a curious contraption of pipes dripping a clear
liquid into a glass.

Arnold takes a little of the alcohol from the still and drinks
it, his face contorting with disgust at the taste.

He is about to leave the room when he sees something nestling
amongst the broken fishing rods and umbrellas and cricket bats.
A gun!

Arnold gingerly picks up the gun, can’t believe it.

CUT TO:

He’s sleeping in your dorm, East, so
take his bedding up and get him out of
those dirty clothes.

East fills his arms with bedding then stuffs it into Tom’s arms.

BILL the Porter - and the Matron’s husband - comes in.

EAST

Hello, Bill. This is Tom Brown.
BILL

How do you do, sir?
TOM

Very well, thank you, Bill.
EAST

Are you going to watch the match,

Bill?
BILL

Wouldn’t miss it, Mr East.
EAST

Come on, Brown.

Goodbye, Sally.
East hurries on out.

Tom bows to the Matron, hurries after his new friend with his
arms full of bedding.

There have been two broken collar-

a dozen fellows lamed. Last year a

just stand behind the goal and watch
this first time.

The door opens and a young man of 18, HUBAND, comes in. He is a

Prefect, the highest of the high in this world of boys.
East gets up respectfully.
HUBAND

East. Run along and get me some hot
water, I need to shave.

EAST
But the match is about to start,
Huband.

HUBAND

Then you’d best be quick about it, you
impudent scud.

Huband notices Tom.

HUBAND
Who are you, fellow and why are you

Arnold is pacing the floor, agitated, as Mary continues to
unpack.

ARNOLD
Eleven year old boys with guns! They
race horses, they gamble, they distil
their own liquor.

Despite everything, Mary is almost amused.

MARY
You knew there was work to be done.

Arnold looks out on the quad below.
He watches as East strides across the quad, chatting away, Tom
staggering behind him, trying desperately not to spill any
water.
MARY
I think you should invite some of the
older boys up for tea.

Here? To the house?

Why not? I’d like to meet them.

Tom carries his precious cargo down a dark corridor.

One fellow had his cheekbone shattered

East stops talking. He has seen the figure of Flashman smoking
in the corridor ahead of them.

FLASHMAN
East, you little lout. Come here with
my hot water.

EAST
It’s not for you, Flashman, it’s for
Huband.

Flashman strolls down the corridor towards East and Tom, looking
Tom over with a sneer, trailing his magnificent silver-topped
cane down the wall.

FLASHMAN

With a sudden flash of his walking stick he smacks the silver-
head against East’s startled forehead, making him hold his head
in pain.

FLASHMAN
(To Tom)
Put it in my study, Brown, or you'll
get more of the same.

Other FIFTH FORMERS have come out of their studies now, some of
them wearing the same dandy clothes as Flashman, all of them
ready for some entertainment.

FOTHERGILL and SPEEDICOT are among them, they love a bit of
bullying.

SPEEDICOT

it over the startled Tom’s head.

The older boys laugh and jeer as Tom just stands there,
humiliated, water running from his nose and saturating his
clothes.

END OF PART ONE

PART TWO

EXT - RUGBY SCHOOL/PLAYING FIELD - DAY 17

East is in his white trousers and white shirt with a black skull
and cross-bones motif on the chest, hurrying over to the field
with Tom behind him.

There are fifty or sixty players on each side and hundreds of
non-playing schoolboys behind each set of posts.

An older boy, powerfully-built, is shaking hands with the older
players on both sides. This is BROOKE.

East indicates the massed ranks of boys behind the School House
posts.

EAST
It’s School House against the rest of
School.

TOM

Am I School House?

EAST
Of course you are. Just stay behind
the goal-line with the small boys and
keep out of trouble. If the ball goes
behind the line you have to touch it
down before one of the other side do.

Tom is intrigued by the figure of Brooke and the obvious status
he has.

EAST
(Exasperated)
Who is that? That is Old Brooke, the
greatest Captain of School House there
has ever been. He’s come back to hand
over to Frobisher before he goes up to
Oxford.

Brooke sees Flashman and his friends Speedicot and Fothergill
arrive on the touchline in their flash suits and canes.

BROOKE

Flashman, why aren’t you playing?
FLASHMAN

Turned my ankle, Brookey. Most beastly

luck.
Brooke isn’t sure he believes him but time is pressing.

BROOKE
Come on, School House! Play up!

A buzz of expectation goes around the boys as the two sets of
players face each other.

East takes a deep breath, goes to join the game.
EAST
(To Tom)
Stay there.

Tom nods, too excited for words.

CUT TO:

INT - RUGBY SCHOOL/STAFF ROOM - DAY 18

Arnold is addressing an assembly of the longest-serving MASTERS
of Rugby School, the most prominent and confident being LAMPARD,
a whiskered, severe, cynical-looking man in his sixties.

ARNOLD
The qualifications which I deem
essential to the due performance of a
master’s time here may be expressed as
the combined spirits of a Christian
and of a gentleman.

A smirk from Lampard.

ARNOLD
To that end I intend to make some
changes to the school which I trust
will have the support of you, the
longest-serving masters here at Rugby.

LAMPARD
What sort of changes, Headmaster?

ARNOLD

As I understand it when the gates are
locked for the night there is not a
single Master in the school. Leaving
boys to their own devices like that
can only lead to bullying and wrong-
doing - as has often been the case, I
believe.

The Masters are agitated by this.
LAMPARD
We don’t see it as part of our
teaching duties to mollycoddle boys,
Headmaster. We have our own -
ARNOLD
A lot of these boys are a long way
from home for the first time and we
should be like parents to them.
The Masters look at each other, deeply unimpressed.

CUT TO:

EXT - RUGBY SCHOOL/PLAYING FIELD - DAY 19
Brooke leads a ferocious rush on the school line.

The sport is vicious, brutal, organised violence, with smaller
boys pitted against bigger, older boys, all played out to the
deafening shouts of the boys behind each set of posts.

Tom is half enthralled, half appalled at the level of violence.

Brooke dips a shoulder and a boy’s head bounces off it as he
ploughs over the line.

The boys around Tom cheer, throw their hats in the air.

The would-be tackler is out cold and several boys hurry on to
the field to carry his limp body away.

Arnold listens patiently to Smith.

Silence.

SMITH
Headmaster, the tradition of Rugby
School has always been that the boys
discipline themselves out of teaching
hours. It readies them for the
responsibilities of life, of Empire.

ARNOLD
The boys will have considerable
responsibilities, you need not fear
that, Mr Smith. But they will learn
them in an atmosphere of pastoral care
and Christian love, not in the
survival of the biggest or the
cruelest.

SMITH
The Rugby way -

ARNOLD
(Cheery)
The Rugby way will have to change, Mr
Smith. Birching will give way to
discourse.

LAMPARD
Have you actually ever met a
schoolboy, Headmaster? They are the
riotous natives and we are the
occupying force. They understand this
perfectly.

ARNOLD
Little is taught through dispute, sir,
but everything through sympathy and
love. Any questions?

Now the School House line is under attack, despite Brooke's
defensive power and organising.

The ball spills out of a giant, violent scrimmage and is hacked
on by several of the large, bloodied School players.

It bobbles towards East.

There are worried shouts from the boys around East.

But East is made of stern stuff and throws himself on the ball.
Soon twenty or thirty boys from each side throw themselves on
pop of East and the ball in a flurry of muscle and blood and

The ball squirts out of the scrimmage again and is hacked
towards the School House goal-line again.

There is no-one between the ball and the line.

Tom looks around but none of the scared boys around him are
going to do anything.

He sprints forward and throws himself onto the bouncing ball and
is hacked and buried in turn, submerged beneath a pile of limbs.

Brooke arrives, is concerned for Tom.
BROOKE
Get up here, there’s a little fellow
beneath you.

The players get up one-by-one until Tom is revealed, muddy and
dazed.

pleasure.

EXT - RUGBY SCHOOL/MAIN GATES - NIGHT 22

Lampard, Smith and several other Masters leave the school for
the night by the main entrance.

Bill locks the heavy iron gates after them like a jailer.

SMITH
Good night, Bill.

Laughter from the other Masters as they walk away with their
backs to the school, job done until morning.

INT - RUGBY SCHOOL/SCHOOL HOUSE - NIGHT 23

A huge, dark, wood-panelled room, stuffed to the gunnels with
School House boys of all shapes and sizes and ages.

A fire roars in the great grate, candles alone illuminate the
faces of the boys. They have eaten and their plates and cutlery
are still on the tables. Even the smallest boy has a glass of
beer and several of them smoke pipes.

other members of the Sixth.

Brooke is on his feet, speaking to the House.

BROOKE
As you all know this will be my last
night in dear old School House.

There are shouts of “shame!” and “no!”.

BROOKE
And I believe you have to indulge me
in a few words.

Cheers and banging of beer mugs.

BROOKE
It has come to my notice that bullying
is on the increase in School House and
it pains me to leave at such a time.

Many of the smaller boys glance over at Flashman with dark looks
but he just sits back and smiles.

BROOKE
Bullying is for cowards and must be
stopped. You boys who are now the *
victims, you have it in your power to *

stop it. And by that I do not mean
running to masters or prefects with
your fingers in your eyes. *

Cheers and applause.
These words are listened to intently by Tom.

BROOKE
Promise yourself you won’t be a bully
when you are in the Fifth or Sixth and
it will stop.

Flashman bangs his beer mug, starts a round of “Here, heres!”.

BROOKE
Anyway, enough. I only go on about it
so because I love the place. It only
remains for me to wish my successor as
Captain of School House all the
fortune in the World.

A smile from Frobisher, the anointed prefect. He is a gentle,

BROOKE
I know that you will all give him your
every support. Frobisher.

All the boys raise their glasses to Frobisher, who nods back at
them.

BROOKE

Before I sit down I give you one last
toast. It is a toast that should bind
us together, now and always, to those
who have come before us and those that
are yet to come. It is the dear old
School House, the best house of the
best school in England!

Great roars from the boys and much drinking of beer.

They start chanting Brooke’s name as Brooke shakes hands with
Frobisher and the other members of the Sixth.

Flashman looks sarcastically at Speedicot.

FLASHMAN
What a very pretty speech.

SPEEDICOT
Very pretty.

Tom is overwhelmed by it all but chants Brooke’s name with the
rest of them.

Brooke gestures for quiet and eventually the boys settle.

His hands are covered in drying wax from the candles.

TOM

Flashman takes out a coin from his pocket, throws it at Tom. It
glances off the boys forehead, making him smart with pain.

Speedicot and Fothergill howl with laughter.

Brooke sees this from the top table and it saddens him and
worries him.

East is starting to admire his new friend.

TOM
Dear Lord. Please bless mother and

East sees already that Tom’s actions have been noticed by other

boys.

EAST
What on earth do you think you’re
doing?

TOM
Praying.

TADPOLE

This amuses the boys greatly and they throw shoes and dirty

ARNOLD
It is my most sincere desire to make
this school a place of Christian
education. What do I mean by this?
There is no place or time from which
Religion is shut out, there is no
place or time where we cannot be
serving God by serving our fellow-
creatures.

Flashman yawns theatrically and Speedicot, Fothergill and some
of the others snicker.

ARNOLD
Roughness, coarseness, want of
feeling, unkindness, cruelty,
bullying, these qualities bear no
resemblance to the inhabitants of the
Kingdom of God and will not be
tolerated in this school.

Tom watches Arnold at work, oddly fascinated.

ARNOLD
The false tongue; the violent hand;
the proud or covetous thought; the
indolent temper; the unkind or unjust
or selfish action. None of these
things will be tolerated.

Arnold lets his words echo around the chapel.

ARNOLD
I will believe each and every boys’
word as I would believe a man’s.

A shake of the head from Lampard, who is hating this.

ARNOLD
I will believe what you tell me. But I
tell you now, gentleman, that if you
think this trust on my part is a
license for lying and deception you
will be deeply disappointed. I hope we
understand each other.

bully. In fact it is his duty, to the
school, to me and to God. It is the
only way we will rid this place of the
vicious, cowardly practice of
systematic bullying.

Some of the younger boys look back at Flashman.

ARNOLD
To these ends I have initiated some
initial reforms. There will be no more
horses kept at the school. The beagle
pack will be disbanded forthwith.

The older boys look appalled at this development.
ARNOLD
There will be no firearms held by any
boy. There will be no gambling. There
will be no production or imbibing of
alcohol of any kind.
The middle boys look at each other now, equally appalled.

Lampard and some of the other Masters barely bother to hide
their contempt.

This will be a great school, a

Down below is the familiar figure of Flashman. He is talking to

FLASHMAN
Come on, Sally, don’t be a spoilsport.

Flashman walks towards her as Sally backs off.

SALLY

SALLY

Maybe after we’re engaged.

Flashman uses his silver-topped cane to part Sally’s blouse.
SALLY

Please don’t.

Suddenly the rotten roof gives way and poor Tadpole crashes
through it, his fall broken by a pile of hay.

Flashman looks around, astonished at this interruption.

Sally sees that his attention has been diverted and makes a run

Tadpole is thrashing about in the river, very frightened.

Without hesitation Tom runs and jumps into the water, swimming
across the current towards Tadpole’s flailing hands.

East and Flashman watch as Tom reaches Tadpole.
But Tadpole is so terrified that he is pulling Tom under too.

East starts sprinting along the river bank, trying to get ahead
of his friends.

Flashman looks around, makes sure no-one else has seen any of
this, and then hurriedly slopes away from the scene.

East runs ahead of the struggling boys, sees a weir.

LAMPARD
You know who his father is, of course?

ARNOLD
I understand he’s a generous
benefactor of the school.

LAMPARD
Without his money this place would
have collapsed years ago. There have
been bullies before him, there will be
bullies after him -

ARNOLD
(Angry)
Not in my school there won't.
Smith looks at Arnold, is slowly warming to him.
SMITH
It would indeed send out a serious
message about bullying if Flashman was
sent down.
Lampard looks to the Heavens.
LAMPARD
It’s not my place to offer advice,
Headmaster...

ARNOLD
Go on, Mr Lampard.

LAMPARD
Don’t even think of expelling
Flashman. If you force the Trustees to
choose between you and his father’s
resources...
Lampard doesn’t have to finish the sentence.

INT - RUGBY SCHOOL/TOM’S STUDY - NIGHT 44
Unlike Flashman's study, Tom and East’s is a chaos of books and
broken cricket bats; pictures of Victorian boxers; candles and
wax; cups; bottles etc

East and Tom pretend to read but their minds are elsewhere,
listening for the call that will surely come. It does:

FLASHMAN
(Out Of Vision)
Faaaaag!

East and Tom look at each other, know this is the moment.

CUT TO:

INT - RUGBY SCHOOL/FLASHMAN’S STUDY - NIGHT 45
Flashman is at his door, leaning out into the corridor.

FLASHMAN

shirkers!

FLASHMAN

Faaaaaag!

Tom and East leap up and start barricading themselves in,
locking the door, sliding the bolts over.

They hear Flashman’s voice right outside the door.

FLASHMAN
Open the door, little piggies.

Tom and East look at each other, scared but determined.

Then there is a thump, thump as shoulders charge the old oak
door.

Then one of the panels splinters as an axe bursts through.
East and Tom back away.

Again and again the axe shatters through the old wood until one
of the panels is ripped asunder.

Flashman’s face appears in the hole, drunk and crazed.

FLASHMAN
It’s Flashy.

Tom and East take their sofa and ram it against the door.

TOM
We're not fagging for you, Flashman!

Another beat, the silence worse than noise for Tom and East.

Then balls of flaming paper are thrown through the hole in the
door, filling the little study with smoke.

Tom and East struggle to put them out but there is smoke and
sparks everywhere.

Their eyes are smarting, their lungs screaming, near defeat.

FROBISHER
(Out Of Vision)
What in God’s name is happening here?!

East and Tom open the window, gulp in the fresh air.

FROBISHER
(Out Of Vision)
Open the door, Brown!

Tom and East unbolt the door and open it.

Flashman glares in at them, standing next to Speedicot and
others of the Fifth.

FROBISHER
(To Flashman)
You could have burnt the school down,
you idiot.

FLASHMAN
They were being impudent.

TOM

We're not going to fag for the Fifth
any more.

You see what we have to put up with?
They’re dragging the House down with
their lack of respect.

Frobisher is torn between doing what is right and wanting to be
popular with the older boys.

EAST
Brooke said we didn’t have to fag for
the Fifth.

Frobisher knows this is true and can’t go against the memory of
Brooke.

FROBISHER
He’s right. Now cut along, Flashman,
and no more fagging until you’re in
the Sixth.
Flashman just smiles his smile.

FLASHMAN
Yes, Frobisher.

Flashman, Speedicot and the others slink back to their study.
FROBISHER
(To East and Tom)
You two clean that mess up.

Frobisher moves off, leaving Tom and East to grin at each other.

CUT TO:

INT - RUGBY SCHOOL/CHAPEL - DAY 47

The entire school is gathering for morning service, yawning and
fighting, watched over by Frobisher and the other Prefects.

Flashman, Fothergill and Speedicot try and look above it all.
Tom and East arrive late and scruffy, as usual.

As they come into the chapel an extraordinary thing happens:
some of the smallest boys start to applaud. It’s only a ripple
at first but it quickly spreads, until most of the school are
cheering and stamping.

TOM
Who are they cheering?

Tom is highly amused by this, waves royally. He has never
experienced such adulation before and it goes immediately to his
head.

East, on the other hand, glances up at Flashman with real worry,
knows this isn’t the end of it.

FROBISHER
Silence! Silence!

The cheers die down but Tom has had his first taste of real
popularity and he likes it. He really likes it.

It’s winter and the school buildings are glowering in the grey *
light.

CUT TO:

EXT - COUNTRYSIDE/FARM - DAY 49
A quiet day, just a few fat chickens pecking around a farmyard.

Suddenly Tom and East pounce on the chickens and there is an
explosion of cluckings and feathers.

TOM
Got one!

Tom struggles with the chicken.

The door of the farm house crashes open and an irate FARMER
bursts out, an ancient blunderbuss in his hands.

EAST
Tom!

Tom clutches onto his prize and the two boys run off across the
fields to freedom.

The school house is full of boys being taught by different
Masters in different parts of the room.

Tom and East are struggling to pronounce their Greek as they
chant with their colleagues.

Suddenly everyone stands and Tom looks around:

Doctor Arnold has come into the School House and he is not
alone. The Farmer is with him.

Tom and East freeze in horror. Arnold looks very stern, very
angry.

Arnold walks through the School Room with the Farmer, the Farmer
looking at every boy in turn with fierce concentration.

He looks hard at East. But he’s obviously not convinced and is
about to move on when he catches Tom’s face.

The Farmer recognises Tom and he points a finger at him.

FARMER
That be the one what stole it. *

Arnold looks at Tom who looks bravely back at him.

ARNOLD
Go to my study, Brown.

TOM
Yes, sir.

Tom walks out of the School House, all eyes on him, his
footsteps the only sound in the echoing hall.

Arnold looks at East but says nothing.

Who was your accomplice in this crime?

No-one, sir.

The farmer says there were two of you.

TOM
Just me, sir.

Tom says nothing.
ARNOLD

You stole from this man, Brown. Would
you care to explain why?

TOM
Not really stole, sir.
ARNOLD
The chicken belonged to you, did it?
TOM
No, sir.
ARNOLD

Then in what way was it not stealing?

TOM
It’s a prank, sir. We've always
liberated the odd chicken or two, sir,
it’s a Rugby tradition.

Arnold looks at the boy, feels his anger rising.

ARNOLD
A Rugby tradition?

TOM
Yes, sir.

ARNOLD

You dare stand in front of me and say
that stealing is a tradition?

Tom says nothing, realises he’s played this completely the wrong
way.

Tom Brown walks up the lonely spiral stairs of the caning tower.
He pushes a door open and there is a wooden caning stool.

Tom leans over the stool, his buttocks raised, awaits his fate.

CUT TO:

EXT - RUGBY SCHOOL - DAY 53

A gaggle of boys - including East, Tadpole and Green - gather

Tom waits.
Far below he hears the door of the tower open and close.

Arnold’s footsteps ring out as he slowly ascends the spiral

The door of the room opens and Arnold steps in.
He selects a cane from the selection. Swishes it.

CUT TO:
INT - RUGBY SCHOOL/SCHOOL HOUSE - NIGHT 55

 

All the boys, from the smallest to the largest, are gathered in
the school house for a riotous night of drinking and revelry.

Tom is the centre of attention, chewing on a chicken wing next
to East. Tom is a real product of old Rugby now, scruffy and
bolshy.

In The background a small, timid new boy - WESTON - is trying to
sing his song, the candles burning his hands, being pelted by
the other boys.

FROBISHER, HUBAND and several other members of the Sixth come
in, serious-faced but barely noticed in the mayhem.

Weston falters, in tears, and is made to drink the salt water to
loud cheers.

FROBISHER
Silence! Silence in here!

The other Prefects smash their sticks down for the silence which
finally arrives.

FROBISHER
This afternoon I had a discussion with
the Doctor when he made plain his
displeasure with School House -

TOM
What about my displeasure with him!

Tom shows his buttocks to much hilarity.
FROBISHER
- and he informed me that from now on
all his reforms must be met without
further obstruction. There will be no
more gambling in School House.

Boos from the boys.

Tom and East’s set is starting to get rowdy, fuelled by beer.
The Prefects call for silence again.

FROBISHER
There will be no more drinking of any
sort. Any boy found distilling or
brewing alcohol will be instantly sent
down by the Doctor.

The boys start to murmur with discontent.
TOM
Can’t we just wait until Christmas
when the Doctor will be sent down by
the trustees anyway?
Much cheering and laughter.
FROBISHER
I’d ask you not to forget who you’re
talking about, Brown.
TOM
The man who is destroying this school,
Frobisher.
More loud cheers.
FROBISHER
(Furious, to his Prefects)
Get him out.

The Prefects wade in to remove Tom from the assembly but his
friends pull him back.

There is an ugly little scrummage, a few punches are thrown, a
few canes swished down on young limbs.

FROBISHER
Stop this! Stop this at once!

Mayhem in the old School House.

Flashman watches all this, fascinated, not sure which way to
turn. He looks over at Frobisher, who looks really worried.

Windows burst open as objects are thrown from the school to
crash to the ground below.

The retreated Frobisher, Huband and some of the prefects watch

Tom walks into the great School House.

At the far end Frobisher waits for him, his cane in hand,

Without being asked, Tom spreads himself on the prefect’s desk
and awaits his punishment.

Tom and East are slumped at their desks, Tom carving his name *

Hall.
Tadpole leaps to his feet.

TADPOLE
Sir?
ARNOLD
I believe you have a passage of
Xenophon you have prepared. Read it to
me.
Tadpole starts to stagger badly through the passage.

ARNOLD
Stop.

Tadpole stops, hopes this is the end of it.
ARNOLD
That is not the passage you are meant
to have prepared. This is the passage.
Arnold skips further on in Tadpole’s book, points.

not asked to prepare that far, sir.

Arnold scowls at him.

Arnold takes out a cane, swishes it.

Tadpole is crying before the first blow slashes across his palm.

Good. Because I’ve been looking

Roast him!

A roar goes up from the Fifth and they manhandle Tom over to the

Tom’s wrists are held against the mantelpiece and his legs are
spread-eagled.

The heat is obviously intense and Tom’s face starts to crease

Damn the ticket. I want him to burn.

Tom struggles but Flashman is determined to keep him there.
Tom’s clothes start to smoke.

Nonsense. You haven’t had enough, have

Angry, Flashman retaliates with some nasty slogs of his own.

The fight is in full swing, blood pouring from both Tom and
Flashman's faces.

The boys are cheering and clapping.

EAST
Go on, Tom!

SPEEDICOT
Finish him off, Flashy!

The youngsters are really getting behind Tom now, their hero
pummelling the larger, out-of-condition Flashman.

Tom ducks inside a punch from the tiring Flashman and belts him
on the nose, blood spraying everywhere.

SPEEDICOT
Time!

EAST
(Outraged)
No, it’s not!

Flashman staggers back to Speedicot and his corner, his dandy
clothes spattered in blood.

EAST
You’ve got him, Tom! He’s blowing like
a whale. Just don’t be in a hurry,
wait for your opening.
Tom nods, spits out his water, pink with his own blood.

Flashman is in a bad way and doesn’t fancy much more.

The dusters.
Speedicot looks around, very wary of anyone overhearing.

SPEEDICOT
You’ve got him, Flashy.

Give me them.

Speedicot surreptitiously slips some large, brass knuckle-
dusters into Flashman’s hand.

Tom and Flashman stand up.

Arnold watches the fight as Frobisher hurries across the quad.

FROBISHER
Brown and Flashman are fighting, sir.

ARNOLD
So I see. Do you know why?

FROBISHER
Something to do with young Arthur,
sir. You know, the new boy. Shall I go
and stop it, sir?
A beat as Arnold considers.

ARNOLD
No.

Frobisher is taken aback by Arnold’s answer.

He’s yours, Tom!

Flashman slips his hand into his pocket and comes out with the
knuckle-dusters slipped onto his fist.

He smacks Tom in the face and the brass cuts into Tom’s startled
forehead.

East is alarmed.

EAST
Tom?

Now Flashman has the advantage and a flurry of right-hooks send
the brass slamming into Tom’s face, blood bursting everywhere.

Tom’s legs wobble and he goes down.

East is quickly at his side, not noticing Flashman slipping the
knuckle-dusters into his pocket.

EAST
Are you alright, Tom? Tom?

Tom is barely conscious.

CUT TO:

INT - RUGBY SCHOOL/QUAD - DAY 102

Arnold has seen what has happened, watches with concern as the
younger boys crowd around Tom.

Suddenly Flashman turns around and runs and kicks Tom in the
stomach.

The knuckledusters slip from his hand and clatter onto the *
cobbles. *

All the boys look at them, appalled, them up at Flashman’s face*

FLASHMAN *
All’s fair in love and war. *

East is outraged and goes for Flashman but Tadpole and Green *

I won't be caning you.

Flashman looks relieved at this.
ARNOLD
Go to your dormitory, pack a bag and
leave the school at once. The rest of
your belongings will be sent on.
Flashman is shocked to the core by this.
FLASHMAN
(Angry)

Have you any idea who I am, sir?

Arnold looks Flashman steadily, contemptuously in the eye.

ARNOLD
I know exactly who you are, sir. Get
out.

Bill opens the main gate of the school to let Flashman out.

FLASHMAN
Lovely night, Bill.

Flashman walks cockily away from the school, trying to show he
doesn’t care, his bag in his hand.

Suddenly he is pelted with mud and rotten eggs as dozens of
small, bullied boys break cover and attack Flashman.

Flashman covers his face, frightened.

The boys race back through the gate and into the safety of the
school, leaving Flashman dirty and bedraggled.

Bill locks the gate.

Arthur stirs.
TOM
It’s me, Arthur. Tom. How are you? You
gave us fellows a hell of a shock with
your fainting tactic.

ARTHUR
Did he hurt you?

TOM
Flashman? Not a bit.

A shiver seems to wrack Arthur’s body, alarming Tom.

TOM
Arthur?

Arthur seems to slip off into a deep sleep.

Arthur?

Arnold is standing in the room, has watched some of this.

Tom looks

over at Arthur’s empty seat.

Little Weston comes into the School House with a note and every
boy watches him walk up to Smith with trepidation.

Smith takes the note and reads it.

Tom lets himself into the Arnold’s drawing room.

Arnold and Mary are both there, turn to look at him.

ARNOLD
Come in, Brown.

Tom notices that there is another woman in the room, young and
very beautiful. She looks tired but her eyes watch Tom come into
the room with great interest. This is FRANCES, Arthur’s mother.

At her side is a very pretty girl of about his age.

ARNOLD
This is Arthur’s mother and his
sister, Charlotte.

Frances puts her hand out to Tom.

FRANCES
I believe that Charlotte and myself
owe you a great debt of gratitude for
looking after our dear boy these last
weeks.

Arnold and Mary exchange a glance of pride at this.

TOM
Is he better, ma’am?

FRANCES
A little. He’s asking for you.

Tom looks at Arnold and Arnold nods.
ARNOLD
Just for a while, we must not tire
him.
Tom is excited, about to leave.

FRANCES
Thank you again, Tom. From both of us.

Charlotte flashes Tom a look.

You're the best bat in School House,

Tom smiles at this.

Tom nods.

ARTHUR

Did you like my mother, Tom?
TOM

Very much.
ARTHUR

And Charlotte? Did you like her?

ARTHUR
If anything should happen to me will
you promise that you will look after
them? You're very good at that.

TOM
Nothing’s going to happen to you,
stupid. Don’t talk that way.

ARTHUR

I’m not afraid of dying.
TOM

ARTHUR

I’m not afraid of my friends dying,

Tom is getting changed for cricket with other boys from School

East looks over at his friend, concerned.
Tom seems distracted, not his usual rumbustious self.

All the boys stand as Arnold comes into the pavilion. He
addresses them all but his words are really for Tom.

ARNOLD
I thought you would like to know that
I have just spoken to the Doctor and
Arthur is sat up in bed and eating a
hearty breakfast.

This is indeed good news and Tom breaks into a smile.

Arthur lies in his sick bed, smiles at the noise.

His mother is reading to him from “Pickwick Papers” as Charlotte

FRANCES *

“And in the midst of all this, stood *

Mr. Pickwick, his countenance lighted

hands were not so employed, rubbing

Arnold would like to say more but he can’t find the words.
He turns and leaves the room, closing the door behind him.

A shocked, stunned beat.

Then Thomas Brown - brave, fearless Tom - starts to cry like a
