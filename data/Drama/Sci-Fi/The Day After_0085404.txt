by Thomas Hart Benton, the great muralist of the
Middle West. Undulating prairies, reapers scything
summer hay, a butterfly chaser -- all the dark, rich,
rolling energy of a fertile land. SOUND OF WIND
STIRRING in the grass, SONG of a meadowlark, dis-
tant THUNDER.

2 EXT. MIDWEST PRAIRIE LAND - SEQUENCE - START SUNRISE 2

wine-red through Indian grass; a distant man-on-
horseback crossing a stream, a lark in the grass -
fussing about its nest fat with eggs; wildflowers,
gentian and blazing-star. A hawk slowly circles

over a rabbit as it scampers, pauses, sniffs,
scampers, sensing some unseen threat. The hawk
dives. Several children (age 10 exiting a school-
bus on a farm road, rum after, making faces at their
friends behind the windows...

3 EXT. FARMLAND - LOW-FLYING AERIAL - DAY 3

 

from prairie to farmland. We see summer corn and
wheat fields, some threshers working. The varied
geography of the heartland: giant green circles,
the brown-green-gold squares and rectangles of
family farms. Hay, soybean, pasture, livestock
prazing. White farmhouses, barns, silos, wind-
reaks... and INTERCUT two or three mysterious
“parking lots" among the cornfields, contour plow-
ing patterns. Surrounded by drainage ditch, cy-
clone fence, the dirt rectangle, perhaps 75x150
yards, features a massive concrete block on a short
track, an adjacent maintenance building. This is
the lid of a Minuteman missile silo.

4 EXT. KANSAS & MISSOURI RIVERS - AERIAL - DAY 4

flies low along the wide river, moving from farmland
to industry. We are approaching Kansas City and the
conjunction of two great rivers. We see railroad
yards, huge barges, traffic zipping along the ex-
pressway, giant grain elevators, stockyards, oil
refineries, Royats Stadium... the buildings of
downtown KC catching the sharp morning sun. sMAIL

IVES
Well, the oxygenated blood is
going back into the lungs, before
it gets to the heart.

Oakes nods, pleased, then looks at Hachiya:

OAKES
Dr. Hachiya? What do we do?

Sam Hachiya looks very Japanese, but speaks with an
American accent. (INTERCUT SCANNING SCREEN.)

HACHIYA
We go in and make a nice little

leak across to carry enough
oxygen to the rest of the body.

Oakes opens Joe's shirt, exams scars, pacemaker, ap-

luminous, "accusing."

JOE
I had turkey with yams, beans,
cranberry sauce, two glasses of
milk and rice pudding which I
hate. Nurse said she's getting
me some ice cream but she never

art. They pass a large golden Amida Buddha. INTER-
CUI DOLLY: beneath a temple ceiling... past rich
porcelains, silks, scrolls, a Chou dynasty bronze
warrior and horse. Indicating a misty mountain land-
scape painting:

MARILYN
Sometimes it's hard to know how
to experience a Chinese landscape
because the artist doesn't tell you
where you're watching from -- like
in a Turner or a Corot or something.
Know why? Because he wants you to
be in the landscape, a part of it,
not out here looking at it.

Oakes smiles, savoring her enthusiasm, just enjoying
being in her company.

OAKES
You mean a God's eye point of view.

MARILYN
No. Well. Yes. If by God you
mean everywhere-and-inside sort
of thing, yeah.

They exchange a glance, grin, her eyes evasive.

OAKES
All I asked was why you chose Boston...

MARILYN
(bursts out)
Mainly because it's thirteen hundred
and ninety-one miles away from here.

Oakes is taken aback. Marilyn sees the hurt in his face,
immediately remorseful, touches his arm.

MARILYN

Oh, God, that sounds awful. I don't
mean it to come out that way, like
a lousy chorus of 'She's Leaving Home’,

MARILYN

See? I still call it home. That's
the problem.

They resume walking, away from PANNING CAMERA...

OAKES
O£ course choosing Boston has
nothing to do with the fact that
Gary Kazakian's starting Tufts
Medical this fall.

MARILYN
No. Well. Maybe a little. But
it's not like we're going to be
living together or anything. At
least not right away. Actually,
I just got accepted by the Boston
Museum School, half scholarship.

TV HOST
Where does that leave the West
Germans? .
DIPLOMAT

Well. They don't want their cowutry
to be a battleground for the
superpowers anymore than the British
do, but they're opting for nuclear
independence like the French, rather
than withdrawing as the English are
considering. That is why Bonn has
just given its three-month notice of
withdrawal from the Nuclear Non-
Proliferation Treaty. They want
their own weapons.

TV HOST
But the West Germans already have
access to our weapons through NATO.

Ellen passes through living room with laumdry.

DIPLOMAT
Conditionally, yes. .With the blessing
of the Supreme Allied Commander in
NATO who is, of course, an American.
And that's their great fear: that

springs around as if to chase her.

OAKES
We're seeing the first symptoms
of radiation sickness. Loss of
appetite, vomiting, diarrhea,
epilation, subcutaneous bleeding,
general hemorrhaging due to
reduced platelet count. The
difficulty comes in separating
shock victims from those with
severe radiation poisoning,
because the symptoms are in many
cases the same. Try to determine
if possible where the patients
came from, how close they were to
a blast, and how long they've
been explosed to fallout since

In view of the fact that our drug

There's no per se cure for radiation

medication to go around.

Everyone present feels the desperation and impatience

sitting up in bed, a pink ribbon around her neck. She
is flanked by two empty beds, only inert human forms in
the other beds. TWIST to include David entering,
quietly overjoyed to see her. She quickly "smooths"
her cheeks, straightens her hospital gown. They just
look at each other a moment.

DENISE
You look like you fell off your
bike.

She instantly realizes who she is talking about, looks
haunted, then worried, then manages to smile again.
David looks at his dirty clothes.

DAVID
It's all push-and-shove out there.

DENISE
What have they got you doing?

DAVID
Emergency details. Hauling food,
pitching tents, a little bit of

pathetic and absurd. Jude rises slowly, walks toward
Oakes. They stand looking at each other. His eyes
have strange milky centers, as if burnt out, unable to

eyes, wondering at his silence. Now, Jude raises his
hand, offering Oakes...

Jude just looks at him. Jean rises in the b.g., faces

Oakes is confused. When Jude stops and turns back,
Oakes understands that he is to follow.
