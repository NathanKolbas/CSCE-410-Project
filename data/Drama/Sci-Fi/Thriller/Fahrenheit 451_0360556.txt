SCREENPLAY BY

- September 2005 -
 

 

FADE IN:

IN SLO-MO, an object falls through frame -- a book. Rolling,
tumbling. Dropping from sight. Soon:

Another book. And another.
Books. Falling. And soon:
Raining. It's raining books. Why?

Now comes a VOICE, softly, sharing his most quiet and precious
thoughts:

MONTAG (V.O.)
I love the soot. I love the heat. I
love the moment of combustion. Most
of all, the smell of kerosene. Here
is what I know: "Fire is bright.
Fire is clean. It is good to burn."
(beat)
It is all I need to know.

CuT TO:
A KLAXON HORN BLARING. RED LIGHTS SPINNING. A fire alarm --
INT - FIREHOUSE - NIGHT
-- summoning to action:
FIREMEN, running, boots all a-scuffle, grabbing HELMETS off
pegs, yanking EQUIPMENT from storage lockers, cascading down
rows of brass poles through holes in the floor...
They swarm their beloved FIRE TRUCK, the Salamander, everybody
climbing up and taking positions on the running platforms,
dropping external seats and strapping in...

The ENGINES START, a turbine WHINE exploding to a DEEP BASSO
ROAR. Like a dragon waking up. Ready to breathe flame.

Headlights blaze to life. EMERGENCY STROBES turn the world
surreal. The Salamander moves out, the dragon leaving its
cave on massive multi-axle wheels...
EXT - FIREHOUSE/CITY STREETS - NIGHT

..and emerging into the night.

Following close behind the Salamander is a second vehicle,
the CONTROL VAN -- armored, black, unfathomable.

HOMELESS. PEOPLE scatter from their path. Traffic pulls over.
 

ON THE MOVING SALAMANDER

Noise and fury. CAPTAIN BEATTY looks back from his seat,
enjoying the expressions on the faces of his men -- tense,
exhilarated. He sees GUY MONTAG grinning into the wind.

CAPTAIN BEATTY
Good for you, Montag!

MONTAG
What, sir?

CAPTAIN BEATTY
That grin! The fierce grin of all
men singed and driven back by flame!

MONTAG
I love it, sir!

Beatty turns forward again, smiling...

CAPTAIN BEATTY
I know you do, son.

VOICE (V.0.)
Form up! Eyes front!

curt TO:
INT - FIREHOUSE - NIGHT (TROOP INSPECTION)

...and SCORES OF POLISHED BOOTS CLAP LIKE THUNDER. SCORES OF
POLISHED HELMETS, gleaming black and bearing the mark of 451,
snap in one direction. SCORES OF FIREMEN, chiseled of stone,
true believers all, stand ready.

Stepping before them, boots treading the silence with holy
authority, is Beatty. A man of power. Of conviction. A man
who knows his place in the world.

He stops. Takes them all in, his men of faith. He loves them
more than he loves himself. In a voice that fills the hall:

CAPTAIN BEATTY
An emperor of ancient China said:
"History begins with me."
(pause)
He was wrong. History begins with
us.

CUT TO:
EXT - SALAMANDER - NIGHT (FIRE ALARM)

The Salamander rises hugely into view, cresting a street.
NEIGHBORS are pouring from their homes to watch. SEARCHLIGHTS

probe from the sky as POLICE HOVERCOPTERS circle whisper-quiet
overhead.

The Salamander stops with a HISS OF BRAKES. The control van veers
past it, taking up a supporting position. POLICE VEHICLES are
arriving to provide backup.

Firemen swarm from the Salamander, the night chaotic with FLASHING
LIGHTS and running men.

Beatty leads Montag and the others up a squalid lawn toward a
house. A MAN'S face, white and terrified, watches them approach
through the cracked panes of a window.

MAN
(shouting, muffled)
Go away! You've got the wrong house!
INT - CONTROL VAN - NIGHT

Meanwhile, CONTROL PERSONNEL are studying the action on banks
of MONITORS, recording everything. One monitor flashes an
incoming message: "Warrant Authorization."

COMPUTER VOICE
Warrant is good. You have Supreme
Court approval to proceed.
EXT - HOUSE - NIGHT

Beatty and his men arrive at the doorstep.

MAN
Go away, I said! There's nothing
here!

CAPTAIN BEATTY
Indeed.

(turns to his men)
There never is.

They rush the door with RAMS, blowing through it like a fist.
They swarm in, trailed by Beatty --

CAPTAIN BEATTY (V.0.)
Let me hear it, you men!

CUT TO:
INT - FIREHOUSE - NIGHT (TROOP INSPECTION)
-- and their voices boom like cannons:
FIREMEN

FIRE IS BRIGHT! FIRE IS CLEAN! IT
IS GOOD TO BURN!
 

CAPTAIN BEATTY
And why is it good to burn? What
does fire do?

FIREMEN
FIRE SWEEPS AWAY THE CLUTTER OF THE
PAST!

CAPTAIN BEATTY
And why is that good, you men? What
does that provide?

 

FIREMEN
A BRIGHT AND SHINING FUTURE!

CAPTAIN BEATTY
Let me hear it!

FIREMEN
A BRIGHT AND SHINING FUTURE!

CAPTAIN BEATTY
Again!

FIREMEN
A BRIGHT AND SHINING FUTURE!

CUT TO:
INT - HOUSE - NIGHT (FIRE ALARM)
A HANDHELD SCENE of screaming chaos:

MAN
I told you there's nothing here!

The WIFE launches herself at the husband, slapping him,
flailing and screaming --

WIFE
Idiot! I told you this would happen!
I told you!

MAN

Shut up! Shut up!

-- and the firemen separate them, restraining them both, her
eyes landing on Beatty as:

CAPTAIN BEATTY
Madam?

WIFE

He's right...thereâ€™s nothing
here...nothing...
 

Beatty raises his PLASMA SCREEN CLIPBOARD, studies it:

CAPTAIN BEATTY

~ Mr. and Mrs....Mugniani? Did I
pronounce that right?
His eyes go to THREE SHRIEKING CHILDREN being herded into the
room by the firemen.
CAPTAIN BEATTY
And the three Mugniani children.
Victor, Paul...and little Emily...
WIFE
-..-no...don't hurt them...
CAPTAIN BEATTY
Madam, please. We're not savages,
after all.
(to his men)
Outside.
The family is dragged out, the woman SCREAMING as she's pulled
out the door...
WIFE
NOT MY HOUSE! NOT MY HOUSE!
~ CAPTAIN BEATTY
Montag? If you please?
MONTAG
Sir!
(turns to the men)
LET'S GO!
-+-and they spread throughout the house, tossing the place,
pounding on walls and listening for the hollow sounds...
INT - CONTROL VAN - NIGHT
-.-While the images are fed to the monitor screens in real
time from the firemen's helmet-cams, recording everything.
INT - HOUSE - NIGHT
Beatty waits in the whirlwind, serene, taking it all in.
MONTAG
comes to a floor-to-ceiling display shelf lined with dishes
and bric-a-brac. He runs his hand up the side, trying to get
his fingers behind it. It's sealed to the wall.
VW

MONTAG
Shelf!
 

6.

He pulls an X-RAY WAND as two firemen rush to his side, also
pulling wands. Montag activates his, playing a lavender light.
He taps a button on his helmet, causing a clear RED VISOR to
lower over his eyes --

MONTAG'S POV

-- which, in combination with the wand, gives an X-RAY IMAGE
through the shelves and into the wall. He sweeps the wand,
seeing vague shapes appearing like ghosts -- tall, slender,
rectangular, hidden in the wall among the studs.

MONTAG

MONTAG
I got something.

FIREMAN #1
Me too!

MONTAG
(clicks his comlink)
Control?

INT - CONTROL VAN - NIGHT

We're seeing the ghost images in the wall coming across the
monitors. CONTROLLER #1 taps his keyboard...

CONTROLLER #1
Hold on. Hold on.

-+-and a computer schematic forms on screen, outlining the
shapes in glowing red lines. The computer extrapolates the
image, lifting one of the objects out as an animated wire-

form. It's a book. The computer revolves the image, opening
the covers, riffling the pages.

CONTROLLER #1
You're confirmed.

INT - HOUSE - NIGHT

Montag and the others jam pry bars behind the shelf, ripping
it loose from the wall in an explosion of plaster and wood.

It topples, revealing a hidden library, the space in the wall
lined with books.

They start pulling out armloads of books, hurling them across
the floor.

VARIOUS ANGLES

as the search continues. Firemen play wands on sofas...over
floors...up walls...across the ceiling. Suddenly:
 

FIREMAN #2
Attic! I got a crawl space!

CAPTAIN BEATTY
(glances up)
Attic. How original.

TIMECUT :

A PAIR OF ROARING CHAINSAWS rise up on long extensions and
chew into the ceiling, spewing debris, cutting two long
parallel grooves down the hallway...

...and the ceiling collapses, dropping awesomely into the
hallway bringing a ton of books with it.

The dust doesn't even have time to clear before another section
of the ceiling unexpectedly gives way --

-- and a YOUNG MAN plummets as well. He hits the floor hard,
scrambles to his feet in the billowing plaster dust, wild
with fear and adrenaline, swinging a baseball bat.

YOUNG MAN
BASTAAARDS! BASTAAARDS!

Montag gets hit in the arm and spins against the wall,
clutching his bicep. The kid keeps swinging, scattering firemen
as he flees down the hall and out the back door.

FIREMAN #4
(amped up)
Go after him?

CAPTAIN BEATTY
No, let the Hound deal with it.
(raises his plasma screen) )
Montag? Injured?

MONTAG
No! I'm okay!
(to the others)
Let's keep going!

CAPTAIN BEATTY
That's the spirit...
(tapping his touch screen)
---hmmm. Our unexpected guest would
be who? The nephew?

Beatty's clipboard brings up an image of the young man's face.

CAPTAIN BEATTY
Ah, yes, here it is. Nephew. Joseph.
(as data scrolls)
Physiologicals...DNA...
 

8.

Beatty inputs the data and enters a command: "Activate Hound."
He hits the send button with a flourish.

CAPTAIN BEATTY
Cry havoc and let slip the dogs of
war.

MONTAG
(passing by)
What the hell does that mean?

CAPTAIN BEATTY
(smiles)
It means: "Good boy. Fetch."

EXT - SALAMANDER - NIGHT

The "kennel" at the rear of the truck opens, steel plates
fanning out to reveal darkness within.

We hear something stir...something metallic. A pair of eyes
activate, glowing red.

It emerges into half-light with a SOFT WHINE of servos and
gears -- the head of a dog rendered in alloy and chromium
steel. We hear a GROWL rising in its manufactured throat.

It leaps out, revealed fully as it hits the pavement on rubber-
padded paws. The MECHANICAL HOUND. A living Deco sculpture, a
chromium canine nightmare.

The neighbors shout, thrilling at the sight of it, some clapping
and whistling, others drawing back in giddy carnival fear.

The Hound takes off running like a heat-seeking missile.

EXT - ALLEY - NIGHT

Joseph, the nephew, is running, still clutching the bat. He
suddenly stops, hearing: A DISTANT HOWL. The Hound. It's coming
for him. The young man keeps going, gasping in panic..

INT - HOUSE - NIGHT

-while Beatty assesses the shambles of the house, kicking
through snowdrifts of books at his feet. He picks one up,
idly flips a page or two.

MONTAG
Beacon on the lawn?

CAPTAIN BEATTY
Yes, why not? Give the neighbors a
thrill. Good for public relations.

Montag grins, waving the others toward the door...
 

MONTAG
Scooper! Let's give 'em a show!

EXT - ALLEYS - NIGHT

...and Joseph runs, twisting and turning down the alleyways,
looking over his shoulder as if the devil were in pursuit...

EXT - HOUSE - ON THE LAWN - NIGHT

A SCOOPER, a mini electric bulldozer, dumps a final load of
books atop a "beacon" -- a round titanium-mesh platform that
looks like a trampoline. Plenty of updraft.

As the Scooper backs away, we ANGLE TO:

CAPTAIN BEATTY
Pumpers!

And double-timing into the shot are a DOZEN FIREMEN with
kerosene pumpers on their backs, led by:

MONTAG
Dillman! You're on beacon! Rest of
you, with me!

They run toward the house, snapping gas masks across their
faces. Dillman veers off toward the beacon...

INT - HOUSE - VARIOUS ANGLES - NIGHT

-.-While Montag and the rest enter, spreading out. They begin
pumping kerosene throughout the house, soaking the walls, the
heaps of books, the furniture, priming it like a bomb...

EXT - ALLEY - NIGHT

++-and still Joseph runs...breath exploding...feet pounding
the asphalt...

EXT - SALAMANDER - NIGHT

-.-and the firemen back up to the truck to hang the pumpers
on their frames. They unbuckle the straps, shrug free.

Six men (including Montag) turn as the other firemen help
them into their special padding, their long coats of fire-
retardant leather, their thick gloves, their blast helmets...

EXT - ALLEY - NIGHT

-.-and Joseph glances back, his worst nightmare realized as
the Hound appears from the darkness, veering in pursuit...
 

10.
INT - CONTROL VAN - NIGHT

...and we see Joseph through the eyes of the Hound, broadcast
live over monitors in ghastly tones of night-vision green...

CONTROLLER #2
We have target acquisition.

EXT - ALLEY - NIGHT
...feet pound...rubber-padded paws pursue...
EXT - SALAMANDER - NIGHT

..-.and the six firemen back up to the truck again, shrugging
now into the straps of the FLAMETHROWERS lining the vehicle.

Buckles are snapped. They lift the flamethrowers onto their
backs -- twin tanks, ribbed copper hose, nozzles of chrome...

EXT - ALLEY - NIGHT

...and the Hound makes a flying leap, taking Joseph to the
pavement in a snarl of glittering titanium teeth...

INT - CONTROL VAN - NIGHT

...and Joseph's screaming face comes over the monitor screens
as the Hound savages him, chomping viciously down on his arm...

EXT - ALLEY - NIGHT

...and the Hound's HYPODERMIC TONGUE whines from its throat,
plunging.the needle deep into Joseph's flesh, the amber
contents emptying as the plunger depresses. Soon Joseph stops
screaming and goes dopey from the drug...

EXT - HOUSE - NIGHT

.-while Beatty receives the information on his plasma screen
clipboard: "Suspect In Custody."

CAPTAIN BEATTY
Procaine. That should calm him down.

He turns, motioning "proceed."

MONTAG AND THE FIREMEN

approach six abreast, fully clad in protective gear, helmets
gleaming, flamethrower nozzles held like weapons.

CAPTAIN BEATTY (V.0.)
Yes. Fire is bright. Fire is clean...
 

11.

They stop in a row, activating their gas feeds with a SOFT
HISS. Others rush in with igniters, providing the spark. Pilot
flames are lit, billowing up from the nozzles like torches...

CAPTAIN BEATTY (V.0O.)
...fire sweeps away the clutter of
the past. It is harmony...serenity...
and light. It is our credo...our
religion...

CUT TO:
INT - FIREHOUSE - NIGHT (TROOP INSPECTION)

CAPTAIN BEATTY
...and we are its high priests. We
say mass at flashpoint. Deliver our
benediction at four hundred and
fifty one degrees of Fahrenheit. We
soothe the world with our nozzles
of chromium steel, absolve its sins
with our sermons of heat. And when
the sermon is done, we've turned
sorrow and lies to ash, like
alchemists and magicians of old.

(beat)

Let me hear it again, you men!
Inspire me!

Their voices boom again like cannons:

FIREMEN
FIRE IS BRIGHT! FIRE IS CLEAN! IT
IS GOOD TO BURN!

CAMERA ANGLES INTO the arrow-straight lines of firemen to
settle upon Montag. Proud. Shouting loudest of all...

CUT TO:
EXT - HOUSE - NIGHT (FIRE ALARM)

.--and Montag steps onto the lawn, the other firemen falling
into flanking positions at his side. They set their feet, aim
their flamethrowers at the beacon --

--and begin to burn. WHOOOOOSH--BOOM! STREAMS OF FIRE shoot
across the lawn and the beacon erupts skyward on a BALL OF
FLAME. Everybody shies back, the bonfire lighting up the night,
pushing everybody back with heat.

Captain Beatty sees the husband and wife in custody. His
attention goes to the children, staring at the flames with
tear-streaked faces. He crouches, gentle:
 

12.

CAPTAIN BEATTY
Here's a good lesson for you
children. You'll remember this.
(brushes the little girl's
cheek)
Be good citizens.

THE FIREMEN

turn to the house. Montag takes lead position, fires a
flamethrower blast through the front door.

INT - HOUSE - NIGHT

There's an awesome beat as the kerosene fumes ignite, the
very air itself catching fire...followed by a stunning SERIES
OF BOOMING DETONATIONS hurtling down hallways and through
rooms, funnels of flame ROARING like living things, shattering
glass and peeling walls, eating piles of books.

EXT - HOUSE - NIGHT

The living room EXPLODES, blowing the windows out into the
street, staggering Montag back on a concussion wave of heat.

The other firemen join in, hosing the house with flame from
all directions. EXPLOSIONS punch through the roof, blow out
the walls, hurl enormous BALLS OF FLAME into the night sky.

MONTAG
backs away with the others, seared by the heat.

CAMERA CLOSES IN on him as he snaps his protective faceplate
up and wrenches his breather mask aside, wanting to feel the
heat on his goddamn face. Exhilarated. Worshipping the flame.

And as we COME INTO CLOSE-UP, we again hear his voice speaking
his most quiet and precious thoughts:

MONTAG (V.O.)

Four hundred and fifty one degrees
of Fahrenheit. This is where I live.
The rest is just waiting...and
kerosene dreams.

The flames billow into the sky, roiling smoke as we

FADE TO:
INT - FIREHOUSE LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT

It's dark. Quiet. Montag's freshly showered and wearing his
off duty uniform. He pulls his fireman's ID necklace from a
peg on the locker door, kisses the good luck pendant, hangs
the simple chain around his neck. The fireman's credo ("Fire
 

13.

is bright, fire is clean...") is taped inside the locker,
alongside a photo of his wife MILLIE.

He shuts the locker, grabs his gym bag...
INT - FIREHOUSE - NIGHT

...and moves through the firehouse. The late shift is settling
in, some men on bunks, others engaged in quiet activity. He
passes a poker game in progress. A few men mutter "good-night."

Montag pauses at the Captain's door, sees Beatty working at
his desk in a pool of light. Beatty senses him, glances up.

CAPTAIN BEATTY
Heading home?

MONTAG
Yes, sir. You?

CAPTAIN BEATTY
Soon as I finish my report. You're
mentioned. Damn fine work earlier,
my boy. Well done.

MONTAG
Thank you, sir. Good night.

CAPTAIN BEATTY
(smiles)
Good night. Sleep the sleep of the
just.

Montag moves on. As he approaches the brass poles, he passes:

The Mechanical Hound. Lying in its firehouse kennel with its
head on its paws. Waiting. Patient as only a machine can be.

Montag grabs a brass pole and plummets from view as we

CUT TO:
EXT - CITY STREET - NIGHT

Montag walks with his gym bag. HOMELESS PEOPLE are clustered
around trash can fires, milling like herd animals. Those that
see him coming make sure to get out of his way. Firemen are
clearly figures of authority to be feared and respected.

PLASMA VIDEO DISPLAYS are everywhere -- monitor screens on
street corners, huge projections on the sides of buildings,
ads playing on the sides of buses like living billboards. We
have seen the future, and it ain't quiet -- everywhere you
look, they're trying to sell you or convince you.

Montag heads up the steps to:
 

14.
EXT - TRANSIT STATION PLATFORM - NIGHT

Several large public VIDEO DISPLAYS are playing the latest
war news, showing a hallucinatory montage of night-vision
smart bomb explosions set to stirring theme music. Montag
stares at the images as he stands waiting for his train.

ANNOUNCER (V.0O.)
..-while hours ago a stunning
precision strike leveled half the
enemy capital in retaliation for
the cowardly attack last Wednesday
that claimed the lives of 241 of
our brave coalition Marines...

. A MAG-LEV TRAIN arrives, gliding silently in. He gets on.
INT - MOVING MAG-LEV TRAIN - NIGHT

Even here the media barrage continues -- what years ago would
have been silent advertising placards lining the car on both
sides are, in this day and age, moving video and sound images.
Buy this. Buy that. Hey, have you heard the latest? Be sure
to tune in! The hottest infotainment! The best gossip!

Montag sits with the glazed expression of a veteran commuter,
pretty much tuning it out. Some of his fellow PASSENGERS cast
nervous looks his way, but Montag ignores it.

EXT - MOVING TRAIN - NIGHT

CAMERA PULLS AWAY from Montag at the window to reveal the
train suspended from overhead tracks several hundred feet in
the air, rocketing through canyons of downtown skyscrapers,
one of many trains doing the same.

cur TO:
EXT - OUTLYING SUBURBS - NIGHT

It's quiet and sparse compared to the city, which dominates
the skyline b.g. A few video displays flicker at deserted
intersections. There's not a soul in sight, except:

Montag is walking home from his train stop, gym bag at his
side. He slows, hearing something strange:

The sound of a CHILD SINGING.

He stops, perplexed. What the hell is a child doing outside,
and at this time of night?

He moves to a low fence. The house beyond it is ramshackle
but tidy, set back on a property overgrown and wild. As he
approaches, the unseen child hears him and falls silent.
 

15.

Montag peers over the fence, scanning the darkness. Nothing
but bushes and trees.

MONTAG
Who's there?

Silence. Like breath being held.

MONTAG
Come out where I can see you.
(beat)
It's all right. I'm your neighbor.
I live a few doors down.

CHILD (0.S.)
I know. I've seen you walking home.

CLARISSE eases from behind a tree, her face beautiful in the
moonlight. She's nine years old.

CLARISSE
You're that fireman.

Montag pauses, oddly captivated by the little girl. Seeing
her is the last thing he expected.

MONTAG
You say that like it's scary.

CLARISSE
Fireman are scary. They come at
night and burn down your house.

MONTAG
Only if you've broken the law. I'm
sure you haven't. Have you?

She shakes her head gravely. Montag smiles -- he was joking,
but the little girl's so serious he wants to laugh.

: MONTAG
I didn't think so. So there's nothing
to be scared of. Is there?

CLARISSE
I suppose.

MONTAG
What are you doing out so late?

CLARISSE
Making up songs.

MONTAG
Songs.
 

16.

CLARISSE
(nods)
My uncle says I'm odd.

MONTAG
I'd have to agree.

A POLICE CAR appears, pinning Montag in its spotlight as he
turns and shields his eyes. Clarisse ducks, unseen behind the
fence, light spilling through the cracks in the boards. TWO
COPS are faceless behind the glare:

COP #1
Identify.

MONTAG
Guy Montag. Fireman. District four.
dust heading home from my shift.

IN THE POLICE CAR

A dash-mounted PLASMA SCREEN echoes Montag's words, producing
a wave pattern I.D. match. The screen brings up Montag's image.

RESUME MONTAG

COP #2
Have a good one.

The spotlight kicks off and the cruiser moves on.

CLARISSE
That's your name? Mr. Montag? I'm
Clarisse.

MONTAG
Clarisse.

Montag resumes walking slowly along the fence. Clarisse keeps
pace with him on the other side.

CLARISSE
Do you like being a fireman?

MONTAG
Of course I do. What kind of question
is that?

CLARISSE
I'm just wondering. I never spoke
to a fireman before. Do you ever
read the books you burn?

MONTAG
No. That's against the law. Even
for firemen.
Montag stops

 

17.

CLARISSE
But you still like it?

MONTAG
We protect people. Keep them safe.
People like you. Your mom and dad.
Your uncle.

CLARISSE
He was arrested once for being a
pedestrian.

MONTAG

He must have been doing something
aside from walking.

CLARISSE
No, just walking. My uncle's odd,
too. He says it runs in the family.

MONTAG
What else does your uncle say?

CLARISSE
He says once upon a time firemen
used to put out fires. Is that true?

short, laughs.

MONTAG
No. He's making that up.
(beat)
You should go back inside. Your
parents will worry.

CLARISSE
They don't mind. They say it's safer
at night. Because of the curfews.
So I come out in the yard sometimes.

MONTAG
Why?

CLARISSE
It's nice at night, 'cause it's so
quiet. I like to smell things. And
look at things. Sometimes if you look
real hard, there's a man in the moon.

MONTAG
You mean the mining colonies?

CLARISSE
No, silly, a man. You can see his
face, there on the moon.
 

18.
He stops, stares up at the full moon, but:

MONTAG
I don't see him.

CLARISSE
He's there. You have to look hard.

MAN (0.S.)
Clarisse!

A MAN emerges in the darkness, coming from the house.
MAN
Come away from there. You shouldn't
be talking to strangers.

CLARISSE
It's our neighbor, Mr. Montag.

The man pauses, dappled in shadow, eyeing Montag with caution.

MAN
Please excuse my daughter. She's
very young.

MONTAG
No harm done.

MAN

Come along, Clarisse. It's late.

He takes her hand and pulls her away. As they head off toward
the house, Clarisse looks back:

CLARISSE
Mx. Montag? Are you happy?

MAN
That's enough now. Time for bed.

They vanish across the darkness of the lawn. Montag stands
gazing after them, flummoxed by the encounter. Softly:

MONTAG
Am I happy?

He moves on...
INT - MONTAG'S HOUSE - NIGHT

..-and enters in darkness. He deposits his gym bag, hangs his
fireman's jacket, muttering:

MONTAG
What kind of question is that?
 

19.
â€˜He proceeds into --
THE KITCHEN

-- where he pulls a Ready Meal from the freezer and pops it
in the microwave. The microwave emits a three-second pulse...

MONTAG
Of course I'm happy.

...and he pulls the meal out, now piping hot. He pops the
lid, blows on it, grabs a fork...

...and exits into the hallway, eating, careful not to burn
his mouth. He moves up the darkened hallway toward CANNED
VOICES and flickering light coming from the TV room.

MONTAG
Millie? Honey? I'm home...

THE TV ROOM

The room is a TV, the plasma screen walls creating a complete
visual wrap-around. Some banal infotainment program is playing,
peddling trivialities and flashy visuals to an empty room.

MONTAG
off.

The room goes dark. Montag proceeds up the hallway.

MONTAG
Millie?

THE BEDROOM

Montag enters. It, too, seems empty. As he turns to leave,
his foot hits something, sends it rolling across the floor.

It's a pill bottle. Empty. Montag stares down at it, trying
to divine its meaning. He turns back into the room, sees:

A woman's pale foot lying on the floor past the bed.

He darts past the bed and finds MILLIE sprawled unconscious,
vomit staining her mouth and pooling on the floor.

MONTAG
..oh, God...

He goes to his knees, checking her pulse.

MONTAG
Millie! Millie!
(shouting)
Dial medical emergency!
 

20.

PHONE
Dialing.

Panicking, Montag pulls her to a sitting position and gets
his fingers in her mouth, trying to clear the vomit.

MONTAG
Honey. Honey, it's me. Breathe.
Breathe.

RECORDED VOICE (V.O.)
Medical 911. All our lines are busy.
Please stay on the--

MONTAG
Cancel! Damn it!

Desperate, moving fast, Montag pulls Millie to her feet and
slings her arm around his neck.

MONTAG
Dial Captain Beatty! Home number!

PHONE
Dialing.

CAMERA FOLLOWS HANDHELD as he pulls her to the bedroom door
and walks/drags her up the hallway...

MONTAG
C'mon, Millie. C'mon, baby. Can you
hear my voice?

CAPTAIN BEATTY (V.0.)
Yes? Hello?

MONTAG
Captain! It's Montag!

CAPTAIN BEATTY (V.0.)
Montag? What's the problem, you
sound strange...

Montag gets to the bathroom, pulls Millie inside...

MONTAG
I need help! It's my wife! She's
sick! I...I think she's overdosed
on levelers and I can't get through
on the emergency lines!
(to the sink)
Water! Cold!

+..and the faucet starts. He leans her over the sink, splashing
her face, sailing on adrenaline and panic as:
 

21.

CAPTAIN BEATTY (V.0O.)
Hold on. I'll use my priority code.
I'll be off the line a moment.

A CLICK. Montag keeps splashing her face, cleaning the vomit
from her mouth. He lets her sag, lays her down on the floor...

MONTAG
Breathe, honey, breathe.

...and starts giving her mouth-to-mouth, trying to clear her
breathing passage. She's choking, floundering.

MONTAG
Millie, goddamn it, BREATHE!

Another CLICK as Beatty comes back on the line:

CAPTAIN BEATTY (V.0O.)
Hang in there, Montag. Help's on the way.

CUT TO:
EXT - MONTAG'S HOUSE - NIGHT

A WHINE OF TURBINES descends from above, rippling the air
with heat signature exhaust. Montag rushes outside as a HOVER
AMBULANCE drops from the sky and touches down.

INT - MONTAG'S HOUSE - NIGHT

The MEDICS rush Millie outside on a gurney with Montag at
their heels.

INT - AMBULANCE - NIGHT

The gurney is slid into the bay and the MEDICAL TEAM goes to
work. Automated systems engage. Imaging scanners sweep her
body. Needles descend on robotic arms, find her veins, pierce
her skin to draw blood. Plasma screens activate as:

MEDIC #1
Subject. Mildred Evers Montag. Okay,
let's see some history here...
(rapping the touchscreen)
Piece of crap, c'mon.

Millie's info appears, scrolling. The medic works the
touchscreen, everything moving fast:

MEDIC #1
No pre-existing conditions...no
medication allergies...

MEDIC #2
Blood analysis?
 

22.

MEDIC #1
Levelers, big-time. Plus a little
vodka. She's floating.

A probe is used to clear her trachea. A hose is fed down her

throat, the stomach pump engaged. The contents of her stomach
are hosed into a clear plastic bag as:

MEDIC #3
Get that adrenaline into her! Get
those scrubbers going!

More pumps activate. The blood starts draining from her body
via tubes, then run through a system of spinning filters and
re-deposited in her veins. Things start to calm as:

MEDIC #1
Okay, let the machine do its work.
Couple of cycles should do it.

MONTAG

is watching the whole thing through the rear doors of the
ambulance. Medic #1 steps down and joins him.

MEDIC #1
Her vital signs are coming up. She'll
be all right.

MONTAG
Are we taking her to the hospital?

MEDIC #1
Nah, this is outpatient stuff, we
do it all the time. Recycle her
blood, she'll be fine. She'll sleep
like crazy, though, so don't let
that scare you. It's normal.

He moves off. Montag watches his unconscious wife lying there
as the machines hum. The POLICE CAR reappears:

LOUDSPEAKER VOICE
RETURN TO YOUR HOMES. CURFEW IS IN
EFFECT. RETURN TO YOUR HOMES... ,
Montag turns, sees groups of NEIGHBORS watching from the

sidewalks up and down the street. They turn and head back
into their homes.

Montag looks to Clarisse's house. She and her family are
watching from their porch. They're at a distance, but even
from here Montag can feel the little girl's gaze as we

FADE TO:
 

23.
INT - BEDROOM - MORNING
Montag awakens to find Millie's side of the bed empty...
HALLWAY

...and he emerges from the bedroom. The TV room is already
on, but also empty. He continues up the hallway to --

THE KITCHEN

-- where he finds Millie making breakfast, pale and drawn,
drifting like a ghost. PLASMA TVs are playing in here, too,
drawing her attention as:

MONTAG
Morning.

MILLIE
Hey. You overslept.

MONTAG
(watching her carefully)
How are you feeling?

MILLIE
Hungry. I don't know why I'm so
hungry. I'm starving.
(looks to him)
Did we have people over last night?

MONTAG
Yeah. Some people came.

MILLIE
I'm so hung over. I remember somebody
talking to me. Saying something. I
hope I didn't make a fool of myself.

MONTAG
Millie...about last night...

MILLIE
Why'd you let me drink so much?
I've got this taste in my mouth.
Ugh...did I throw up? Did anybody
see?

MONTAG
Millie, listen...

Suddenly, a SOFT VOICE announces:
VOICE

Mrs. Montag. It's time for the
Family. Mrs. Montag...
 

24.

MILLIE
The Family's here. Let's talk about
this tonight.

Hurrying now, she gathers her tray, pauses --

MILLIE
You okay? You look terrible.

-- and exits into the hallway. Montag follows her.

MONTAG
We should talk about this now.

MILLIE
Honey, it's the Family. And you
have to get ready for work. We'll
talk tonight.

She enters:
THE TV ROOM

MONTAG
No we won't. There'll be some other
program on tonight.

Montag hovers in the doorway as she heads to her favorite
chair, one that swivels 360 degrees.

MILLIE
I'm here!

ANNOUNCER
...welcome you again to the warm
bosom of the Family. Bringing you
love, life, commitment...all the
things you treasure most...

MONTAG
Millie, please...

MILLIE
Honey, shhh. I never miss the Family,
you know that...

We're suddenly surrounded on all sides by a beach. The digital
clarity of the image is stunning, the enveloping 360 so
convincing it's almost as if we've been transported there.

The FIVE CHARACTERS on the plasma screens are life-sized,
walking along the surf, talking earnestly:

BOB
I'm not trying to be controlling,
but I am her father.
 

25.

HELEN
I agree. This is a huge decision
that will affect her entire life.

HERBERT
But it's her life, let's not forget
that. We can't live it for her.

BOB
Of course. But we are a family, and
I feel it bears discussion. What do
you think, Millie?

The characters hit a cue-loop and stop, looking at Millie,
awaiting her answer. This is an interactive soap opera:

MILLIE
Yes. Yes, of course I agree. It
certainly bears discussion.

The characters resume walking.

BOB
Thank you, Millie. We can always
count on you to be the voice of
reason.

HELEN
Millie dear. You are such a comfort
to this family.

MILLIE
(beaming)
I'm always so happy to help.

BOB
Now, Jenny...about this marriage
proposal...what do we really know
about this fellow...

MONTAG
You took all the pills in your bottle
last night.

MILLIE
(distracted)
What?

MONTAG
Your levelers. You took them all.

On screen, the characters pause, looking again to Millie:
BOB

I'm sorry, Millie...did you say
something?
 

26.

MILLIE
No, no...please continue.

MONTAG
You had to have your stomach pumped
and your blood recycled.

MILLIE
That's ridiculous. I wouldn't do a
thing like that.

HERBERT
(pausing)
What's ridiculous, Millie dear?

MILLIE
(to the screen)
Just ignore me. I'm talking to
myself. Please continue.

JENNY
He's from an excellent family, but
what does it matter? I'm so in love,
I've never felt this way before...

MONTAG
But you did. The bottle was empty.

MILLIE
That's not possible. I wouldn't do
that. Why would I do that?

MONTAG
Maybe you took a few and forgot.
Then took a few more.

MILLIE
That's stupid. I didn't. Why would
I?

MONTAG

I don't know. I'm asking.

MILLIE
I wouldn't. Not in a billion years.

She's distracted, trying to follow the discussion on screen.
Montag comes up behind her, trying to get her attention:

MONTAG
Am I lying to you? Millie? Is that
what you think? That I'd look you
in the eye and lie to you?

He puts his hand on her shoulder, but she slaps it away:
 

27.

MILLIE
No! You're just wrong! You're being
stupid, so stop it! Let me watch my
program! I'm missing what they're
saying!

JENNY
...mMost precious thing in the world.
Don't you want for my happiness?
Don't you, Millie? Don't you think
I should have Tyler's baby?

MILLIE
OÂ£ course. Of course you should. I
want you to be so happy.

JENNY
(tears glistening)
Oh, thank you, Millie. I love you
so. It'll be perfect, you'll see.

HELEN
(to Bob)
Millie is the wise one in the family.
She's never wrong.

HERBERT
I don't want to ruin anybody's
happiness, but there's one thing we
haven't considered...

MONTAG
(softly)
I gotta get ready for work.
Millie's no longer listening. Montag drifts from the room.
CUT TO:
EXT - STREET/CLARISSE'S HOUSE - DAY

A cold breeze rattles the autumn leaves across the pavement
as Montag walks toward the transit station with his gym bag.

He slows in front of Clarisse's house, gazing over the fence
across the wild tangle of yard. Curious about the house and
the people who live there.

INT - HOUSE - UPPER FLOOR - DAY

Clarisse is attending home school, using'a stylus on an
electronic pad to do her lessons. Through the window, b.g.,
the tiny figure of Montag can be seen on the street.

Clarisse notices Montag out there, pauses the lesson.
 

28.
EXT - STREET - DAY

Montag sees her appear at the window. She gives him a tentative
smile and a wave. Hesitant, Montag waves back.

Clarisse motions "wait" and disappears from view. A moment
later she reappears with a CAT, an orange tabby, and puts him
on the inner sill. Montag watches, increasingly puzzled.

The cat patiently endures as Clarisse puts a little red cowboy
hat on him with a rubber band strap, then slips his hind legs
into little cowboy boots. Done, Clarisse stands the kitty up
on its hind legs and "puppets" him in a goofy little dance.

The image is so absurd and unexpected, Montag can't help
laughing. Clarisse smiles at his reaction, happy. Softly:

MONTAG
Now that's just...silly.

She makes the cat wave goodbye. Montag walks on...

CuT TO:
INT - FIREHOUSE - NIGHT

-and we're plunged into a cauldron of NOISE: Firemen shouting
as bets are made, insults traded. DILLMAN, LANDERS, PECK,
ORMSBY, and a DOZEN OTHERS are clustered around six wire cages
on the firehouse floor, each containing a LARGE SEWER RAT.

Before them stands the Mechanical Hound, waiting.

As the men jostle and shout, Dillman raises a cage to show

everybody the aggressive, hissing rat within. The cage has a
handwritten number "3" on it.

DILLMAN
Who's it gonna be? Horse number
three? Let's see some money!

PECK
Look at that mean son of a bitch!
That's him, that's my bad boy!

LANDERS
You're gonna lose your shirt, Peck!
PECK
Fifty bucks says you can kiss my
ass!
LANDERS

A bargain! Your wife charges a
hundred!
 

29.

ORMSBY
Go on, Dillman, give it a whiff!

Dillman holds the cage out, letting the Mechanical Hound smell
the rat. To a nose as finely calibrated as the Hound's, the

rat's scent is as good as a DNA fingerprint. (The data appears
on Ormsby's plasma-screen next to "Horse #3: Peck's Bad Boy.")

ORMSBY
Got it! Next!

Dillman dumps the rat out of the cage to join two others
already in the "starting gate" -- a round bottomless holding
pen on the floor. He reaches for the next cage while:

MONTAG AND BEATTY
sit on a cot apart from the others, speaking quietly:

MONTAG
Thank you for helping last night.

CAPTAIN BEATTY
Thank me no thankings, nor proud me
no prouds. It's nothing.

MONTAG
I came close to losing her. If you
hadn't intervened...

CAPTAIN BEATTY
And how's Millie? Okay?
(Montag hesitates)
Tell me.

MONTAG
She won't talk about it. She won't
even admit it happened.

CAPTAIN BEATTY

Maybe that's a good thing. If she
doesn't remember, I doubt she
intended to harm herself. That's
what's got you worried, yes?

(Montag nods)
She probably just lost track. It
happens. Never happened to you?

. MONTAG
I don't take levelers.

CAPTAIN BEATTY
Really? I never knew that. Montag,
I'm surprised at you. It's the
shortcut to bliss, haven't you seen
the ads? Everybody takes levelers.
 

30.

MONTAG
Do you?

CAPTAIN BEATTY
(wry)
I like a little misery now and again.
(Montag laughs softly)
Ah, a smile, thank God. There's the
old Montag. I was beginning to worry.

Dillman dumps the last rat into the holding pen, raises his
arms to quiet the men:

DILLMAN

Welcome to Rat Dome! Six rats
enter...one rat leaves! Mr. Ormsby,
program the Hound for five kills in
random order, if you please! Who
will the lucky survivor be? Final
bets, place your final bets!

(calls over)
Montag, you in?

MONTAG
Not tonight.

DILLMAN
(offering)
And we know our dear captain never
wagers...

CAPTAIN BEATTY
I prefer sure things to guesswork.
But thank you, Mr. Dillman.

DILLMAN
In that case, the betting window is
closed! Horses are at the gate!

A boisterous countdown begins:

ALL THE MEN
FIVE. ..FOUR...THREE...TWO...ONE!

Dillman kicks the holding pen over, freeing the rats --

DILLMAN
And they're off!

-- which scatter in all directions, men jumping and shouting
as rats go zipping past their feet.

Ormsby hits "send." The Hound's eyes go infra-red. Pandemonium
ensues as the Hound springs into action and streaks across
the firehouse like a guided missile...
 

31.

...and catches the first rat within seconds, snatching it up
in its jaws and shaking its chrome head so fast that the rat
flies apart in its teeth. (That rat's data entry turns red on
Ormsby's screen.) The Hound veers and goes after the next
rat, men running and shouting and jumping out of the way as:

MONTAG AND BEATTY

CAPTAIN BEATTY
It's not just the incident last
night, is it? There's something
else troubling you.

MONTAG
We don't seem to talk much at all
any more. I feel like we've drifted,
but...I don't know why. Or what to
do about it. I try.

THE HOUND

makes another kill. Another entry on Ormsby's screen turns
red. The men shout like spectators at a football game.

MONTAG AND BEATTY

CAPTAIN BEATTY
Perhaps I can make our human
resources department available to
you. Therapy, counseling...

MONTAG
Those benefits are for ranking
officers only.

CAPTAIN BEATTY
Well, I wasn't going to spill these
beans just yet...

THE HOUND
kills another rat, veers after the next.
MONTAG AND BEATTY

CAPTAIN BEATTY
++. but I've decided to nominate
you as my replacement when I retire.
That means promotion. Captain Montag,
how does that sound? I'll suggest
they advance you some of those
benefits. With your record, and
your promising future, I'm sure DHS
will see things my way.

Montag is blown away by this news. Beatty leans in.
 

32.

CAPTAIN BEATTY
You're special, Montag. Command
caliber. That makes you a deeply
valuable asset to this department.

MONTAG
I don't know what to say.

CAPTAIN BEATTY
(smiles)
Someday, my boy, all this will be
yours. Including the rats...
(his gaze shifts)
.--oh, hell.

A rat zips under their cot, the Hound in pursuit. They leap
to their feet as the Hound barrels between them, sending the
cot spinning into the air to the delighted howls of the men.

We hear a SQUEAL as the fifth rat is killed. Its data entry
goes red, leaving one. The Hound pauses, awaiting further
instructions. Amidst the jeers and laughter:

ORMSBY
Too bad, Peck. That was your bad
boy.

Peck bends down and sees the sixth and final rat pressed
against the wall under a desk, panting in terror.

LANDERS
And the winner is?

ORMSBY
Horse #2, "Dillman's Delight."

DILLMAN
Ohhh, what a heartbreak! Sorry,
boys, fork it over! I hate to say
it, but I am the winnaahh...

PECK

Take your money and shut your pie-
hole, Dillman.

Suddenly, the ALARM SOUNDS. The men react, scattering as:

CAPTAIN BEATTY
Gentlemen, fun's over! Kindly dispose
of the winner.
Ormsby quickly enters a kill command. The Hound bounds across
the floor and pounces on the last SHRIEKING rat as we

EXT - FIREHOUSE - NIGHT

HUGE DOORS slide open, revealing the Salamander in a glare of
lights. It rumbles out, SIREN WAILING. The control van follows.

CUT TO:
EXT - HOUSE - NIGHT

A three-story Victorian relic stands like a ghost from another
era just outside the downtown financial district, skyscrapers
looming in the misty sky b.g.

The vacant lots in this area have become Hoovervilles of the
future -- shanty towns filled with HOMELESS PEOPLE living in
tents and cardboard boxes. Cookfires are drifting smoke.

Searchlights suddenly blaze from the sky as HOVERCOPTERS
appear. The homeless begin to panic as the SIREN of the
Salamander comes swelling up the street.

LOUDSPEAKER VOICE
(from hovercopter)
REMAIN CALM. THIS IS A ROUTINE FIRE
ALARM. REMAIN CALM OR RIOT TROOPS
WILL BE SUMMONED.

THE SALAMANDER

pulls up before the Victorian house. The control van veers
past it, taking up position as police vehicles arrive to
provide backup. Some of the homeless start drifting this way
from their shanty towns, drawn by the promise of a fire.

Firemen jump down from the truck, marching across the stretch
of dead lawn past a PAIR OF STONE LIONS. This house might
have been a library once, a few hundred years ago.

The battering rams are readied as the men take positions at
the door. Beatty knocks. For a moment there's nothing. Beatty
is about to motion them to break the door down, but then:

A face appears at the window, ethereal and beautiful. It's an
OLD WOMAN, her eyes luminous, her skin like worn silk.

She motions for Beatty to be patient. The face withdraws. A
few seconds pass. We hear the door UNLOCKING from inside.

It opens, revealing the old woman. Her smile is enigmatic, as
if she's merely receiving visitors.

OLD WOMAN
Good evening.

CAPTAIN BEATTY
Madam. We have a warrant.
 

34.

OLD WOMAN

Of course you do. Everything all
nice and legal and proper. Nobody's
rights shall be violated this
evening, I'm sure.

(swings the door wider)
Please do come in. Mind you wipe
your feet.

Montag and the others are trading glances. This is different.
INT - ENTRYWAY OF HOUSE - NIGHT

The firemen enter and spread out a bit, gazing up. We're in a
grand entry foyer that soars three stories up, surrounded on
all sides by landings. The staircase railings are carved wood,
the lighting is Tiffany stained glass, the furnishings are as
ancient as the house. A grandfather clock TICKS SOFTLY.

OLD WOMAN
I've been expecting you.

CAPTAIN BEATTY
Have you indeed?

OLD WOMAN
For many years. I've often tried to
imagine your face. Now I know.

Beatty raises his plasma-screen clipboard.

CAPTAIN BEATTY
Name?

OLD WOMAN
You may call me Mrs. Havisham, if
that pleases you. And I might call
you Pip. Yes, that might be quite
amusing.
(off his look)

Don't insult my intelligence. You
know my name.

CAPTAIN BEATTY
(checks his screen)
Mrs. Roland. I am Captain Beatty.
We've received an anonymous tip...

OLD WOMAN
Is there any other kind?

CAPTAIN BEATTY
...which empowers us by law to
conduct a search for books.
 

35.

OLD WOMAN
And you shall find them, I'm sure.
In the walls. The attic. Under the
floors. Don't forget to check the
cupboards.

CAPTAIN BEATTY
Montag. Have the men proceed, and
see the lady out.

MONTAG
Five teams of three! Carillo, Peck,
first and second floors! Dillman,
third! Landers, basement! Ormsby,
attic! Go!

The teams split up, double-timing. The old woman watches them
go. Montag offers his hand to escort her out.

MONTAG
Ma'am? Please come with me.

OLD WOMAN
I most certainly will not. Nor may
you coerce me. Isn't that right,
Captain?

CAPTAIN BEATTY
Dear lady, let's have no foolishness.
Accompany the fireman, he'll see
you safely out. Please don't make
me insist.

OLD WOMAN
Insist all you like. I am perfectly
within my legal rights, as you well
know.

Montag throws Beatty a puzzled look. Beatty gives the old
woman an appraising look, motions Montag to wait.

CAPTAIN BEATTY
According to whom?

She pulls a book from her pocket, paging through it.

OLD WOMAN

Your own Homeland Security manual.
One of the few books not on the
burning list. I've read it many
times with great interest, especially
the section on your department.

(pauses to read)
"The fire department was established
in 1790 to burn English-influenced

books in the Colonies. The first
fireman: Benjamin Franklin." Oh, I
do so love history.

(keeps paging)
Let's see. Ah, here it is. I have
it marked. Chapter twelve, subsection
four. According to the Supreme Court
decision granting the government
full authority as regards the burning
of books for purposes of national
security, the accused -- that would
be me -- has the right to remain
present and bear full witness.

She closes the book and tucks it away.

CAPTAIN BEATTY
That's an extremely obscure and
seldom-invoked right .

OLD WOMAN
Nevertheless, I invoke it.
{off Beatty's look)
They're your rules. You must abide
by them.

A moment of stand-off. Beatty gazing at the woman. The woman
unflinching. Montag uncertain, caught between them.

CAPTAIN BEATTY
Montag. Scan the lady, if you please.

Montag pulls his x-ray wand, running it up and down the woman's
body. Beatty clicks his comlink...

CAPTAIN BEATTY
Control?

That is satisfactory.

Montag shakes his head -- this is crazy. Beatty glances up as
a VOICE comes over his comlink:

DILLMAN

Cap! You're not gonna believe this...

Dillman and his team are sweeping the hallway walls with their
wands, mouths agape, the ghostly x-ray images revealing:

Books. And more books. Endless rows of them within the walls.

The controllers are watching, amazed. The monitors show x-ray
images of books everywhere throughout the house. Softly:

Dillman appears at the third floor railing above.
DILLMAN

AN ANGLE
replays the opening image of our film:

In SLO-MO, an object falls through frame -- a book. Rolling,
tumbling, dropping from sight.

Another book. And another. Books falling. And soon:

Raining. It's raining books. ANGLE TILTS DOWN to reveal the
old woman watching the books falling all around her. She turns
to Montag, meets his gaze. Softly:

MONTAG
Why do you want to see this?

OLD WOMAN
They're my books.

Montag catches a book as it falls, looks up to see:

FIREMEN

throwing armloads of books over the railings. They rain down,
cascading, fluttering like birds. Montag takes the old woman
by the elbow, guides her gently to a safer position...

EXT - HOUSE - NIGHT

..-while the Scooper dumps another load of books onto the
beacon and backs away...

INT - HOUSE - NIGHT

..-.and boots come pounding as firemen enter with kerosene
pumpers on their backs, fanning out.

ANGLE SHIFTS TO Montag watching the old woman. She's taking
it all in, her expression inscrutable...

All around them, throughout the house, firemen soak the walls,
the heaps of books, priming the house like a bomb...

The fumes are getting thick. Montag snaps his breather mask
over his face, takes a few deep breaths. He pulls the mask
away, offers it to the woman.

OLD WOMAN
No thank you.

She pulls a handkerchief, holds it over her nose and mouth.
A few firemen are gathering at Beatty's side, pumpers empty.
Montag, cued by a look from Beatty, clicks his comlink:

MONTAG
Gentlemen, wrap it up.

Dillman's pumper goes dry. He motions "let's go" to the others
as he clicks his comlink:

DILLMAN
We're done here! Heading down now!

Beatty turns to the old woman:

CAPTAIN BEATTY
The flamethrowers are next. It's
time to leave.

She meets his gaze, her eyes watering from the fumes.

OLD WOMAN
You can't ever have my books.

CAPTAIN BEATTY
(gently)
Books aren't real. Only the law is
real. Come on now.

OLD WOMAN
I'd rather stay.

CAPTAIN BEATTY
You know I can't allow that. Suicide
is also against the law.

MONTAG
Ma'am. This whole house is gonna go
up. Come on. I'll walk you out.

OLD WOMAN
No.

I'm counting to ten. If you don't
leave, my men will pick you up and
carry you out. One...two...

It'll be okay. Just come with me.

CAPTAIN BEATTY

Thank you anyway.

Please.

Go on. I'll be fine.

CAPTAIN BEATTY

OLD WOMAN

She reaches up, undoing her bun. Her hair unravels as she
pulls a small, slender object from it...

OLD WOMAN
..-nine...ten...

...and she holds the object out toward them...

OLD WOMAN
..a big fat hen.

---it's an ordinary kitchen match. Her thumbnail poised on
the sulfur tip. The men draw back, stunned.

CAPTAIN BEATTY
{calm, steely)
Gentlemen, you heard the order.
Evacuate.

The others rush out, but Montag stays. He and Beatty keep
backing slowly toward the door as:

CAPTAIN BEATTY
Allow me to appeal to your reason.
Where's the sense in this?

OLD WOMAN
Where's the sense in anything? The
world's gone upside down.

CAPTAIN BEATTY
The world is fine, it's your mind
that's upside down. See what those
books have done to you?

MONTAG
Ma'am. This is crazy. You don't
want to do this.

OLD WOMAN
This is my home. And these are my
books. Get out. Now.
(as they hesitate)
GET THE HELL OUT!

Montag and Beatty back out the door...

INT/EXT - ENTRYWAY/PORCH - NIGHT

...onto the front porch. A VOICE comes over Beatty's comlink:

VOICE
(filtered)
The police have a sniper! Should we
take her out?

Beatty throws Montag a long-suffering look, clicks his comlink.

CAPTAIN BEATTY
That would defeat the purpose now,
wouldn't it? I'm certain Mrs. Roland
will see reason, once she's had a
chance to think it through. Isn't
that right, dear?

The old woman turns away, walking back to the center of the
xoom, gazing around at the wreckage, the piles of books. Montag
tries to go back inside to grab her, but Beatty puts a
restraining hand on his arm.
 

42.

CAPTAIN BEATTY
Mrs. Roland? You've made your point.
Given everyone a good scare. Well
done. Time to come out now.

She turns, facing them. A long look passes between them as
her thumbnail tightens on the match head...

OLD WOMAN
Play the man, Master Ridley; we
shall this day light such a candle,
by God's grace, in England, as I
trust shall never be put out.

MONTAG
(a whisper)
Don't.

---and her thumbnail scrapes the sulfur tip, FLARING it to

life. Montag's eyes widen in horror --

-- and the match flare leaps into the air, a heartbeat of
white-hot ignition, the air rippling as it catches fire. For
a moment the old woman is surrounded by an aura of flame
swirling about her, lifting her hair and catching it afire,
making her eyes glow like coals --

-- and BOOOOM! The entryway EXPLODES, shattering windows, a
HUGE FIST OF FLAME punching through the front door and blowing
Beatty and Montag right off their feet, hurling them over the
railings and onto the lawn in a storm of debris. Some other
firemen are caught on the run, also blown off their feet...

INT - HOUSE - VARIOUS ANGLES - NIGHT

A firestorm surges up the stairs...races along the
walls...engulfing room after room...shattering the grandfather
clock with heat...consuming piles of books...

EXT - HOUSE - NIGHT

Montag pries his face off the lawn, sees Beatty sitting up
next to him with his pant leg on fire. Frantic, Montag helps
smother the flames as Beatty yells into his comlink:

CAPTAIN BEATTY
Did everybody get out?

CONTROLLER #1
(filtered)
All links are active! Everybody's
fine!

Montag turns, gazing at the house through a pall of smoke and
swirling embers, and sees:
 

 

43.
THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR

An inferno within. A FIGURE appears in the flames. A burning
woman. Staggering in the blast-furnace. Tripping and falling.
Then gone in a rush of flame.

PUSH IN ON MONTAG
staring in horror.

FIREMEN

come running against a backdrop of flames, pulling Beatty and
Montag to their feet, rushing them away as the house burns...

CUT TO:
EXT - ON THE MOVING SALAMANDER - NIGHT

Riding back to the firehouse. Faces grim.

CUT TO:
INT - FIREHOUSE - NIGHT

Gear is being cleaned and stowed. The mood is subdued, quiet.

Montag backs the Scooper off the firetruck, parks it. As he
gets off, Beatty enters and activity comes to a standstill.

CAPTAIN BEATTY
Most of you have never seen a
suicide. They were far more common
in the old days. Just understand
there is no accounting for unstable
minds. You all followed protocol
and did your jobs well. Nobody here
is to blame.

Glances are traded. Nobody feels good about what happened
tonight. Softly:

MONTAG
I missed it. The match. When I
scanned her.

CAPTAIN BEATTY
Then it's your fault? I see. Or is it
mine, for failing to instruct you to
scan her hair? I was officer in charge,
after all. Blame, if any, lies with
me. My report will say so. But Montag.
I was not the old woman who stood in
a house primed with kerosene and chose
to light a match. Nor were you. Nor

CAPTAIN BEATTY (CONT'D)
were any of us. That act of insanity
lies solely with her. Yes?

Montag nods. Beatty motions to the group.

CAPTAIN BEATTY
Let's put it behind us. That gear
isn't going to stow itself, is it?

The men disperse, activity resuming as:

PECK
(grumbling)
I dunno what we're all twisted up
over. Stupid old bitch could'a got
us all killed. I'm glad she burned.

LANDERS
Leave it alone, Peck. Give us a
break...

MONTAG

secures the Scooper, attaching the tiedowns, as Beatty comes
up behind him:

CAPTAIN BEATTY

All done?

MONTAG
I still have to recharge the fuel
cells.

CAPTAIN BEATTY
No. I mean, blaming yourself. All
done? .

Montag hesitates, nods. Beatty starts to move off, but:

MONTAG
Master Ridley. That crazy thing she

said. Play the game, something,
something.

CAPTAIN BEATTY
"Play the man, Master Ridley. We
shall this day light such a candle,
by God's grace, in England, as I
trust shall never be put out."

Some firemen nearby pause, startled.
 

 

45.

CAPTAIN BEATTY

A man named Latimer said that to a
man named Nicholas Ridley as they
were being burnt alive at Oxford,
for heresy, in 1555.

(off their looks)
Oh, I'm full of bits and pieces.
Most fire captains are, after doing
it enough years. The nonsense sticks
to your boots like chewing gum.

(to Montag)
But nonsense is all it is. Romantic,
foolish notions that appeal to feeble
minds and justify idiot behavior
such as suicide.

(leans in, softly)
Go home, Montag. Hug your wife.

Beatty departs. Montag moves to the front of the Scooper to
connect the hydrogen fuel hose...

---and stops. There, lying in the scoop blade, are TWO BOOKS
that _got left behind when the last load was dumped.

ORMSBY
. (suddenly appears)
Need help?

MONTAG

Um...no. Got it. Thanks.

Ormsby leaves. Montag connects the fuel coupling, moves off.

CUT TO:
INT - LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT

-.,and we find Montag sitting before his locker after a shower,
toweling his hair. He looks numb. The place is emptying, locker
doors shutting, voices drifting off, firemen heading home.

He becomes aware of Dillman down the row, lacing his boots. A
look passes between them. It's clear both men are stunned,
deeply shaken. Softly, so only Montag can hear:

DILLMAN
I can't get it out of my head. You?

Montag shakes his head. No, he can't. Almost embarrassed,
Dillman grabs his gym bag and leaves.

Montag is left alone. He rises to his locker, lifts his
fireman's necklace from its peg, drapes it around his neck.

CuT TO:
 

46.
INT - FIREHOUSE - NIGHT

Montag slides down the brass pole, moves through the shadows
past the Salamander. This part of the firehouse is deserted.

MUFFLED VOICES can be heard from the floor above, followed by
occasional bursts of raucous laughter.

Montag's drawn inexorably to the Scooper. He stops, peers
into the scooper blade, sees the two books lying in shadow.

He's frozen, unsure. He reaches in and pulls one out. It's
"Charlie the Choo Choo," by Beryl Evans. A children's book.

He pulls out the other one. "Lord of the Flies," by William
Golding. Neither title means anything to him, but the books
themselves have him transfixed.

Quickly, before he can change his mind, he shoves the books
into his gym bag, heads for the exit...

ANOTHER ANGLE

---and as he rounds the corner, comes face to face with the
Mechanical Hound. The beast is lying there, head resting on
its paws. Montag freezes.

The Hound raises its head, looking like an exotic chromed
Sphinx. Its glowing red eyes abruptly dilate wider with a
soft WHIRRR. To Montag's astonishment, a LOW GROWL builds in
the Hound's throat.

MONTAG
Easy, boy. Easy now.

Montag takes a nervous step back. The Hound rises and comes
forward, sniffing the air...

Its titanium jaws open, gleaming. The hypodermic tongue
distends, slowly at first, then flicking forward and back,
forward and back -- snap, snap, snap! A drop of amber fluid
flies off the needle tip, hits the floor.

MONTAG
sit. Goddamn it, I said sit.

The Hound hesitates, backs off. Its haunches lower and the
beast lies back down, but remains coiled like a spring.

MONTAG
Good boy. Stay. Stay.

The Hound stays. Montag circles past it, out the door...

CUT TO:
 

 

47.
EXT - TRANSIT STATION PLATFORM - NIGHT
The latest war news is playing on the VID SCREENS. Images of
floating HOVERTANKS skimming desert sands in some far off
land. Muzzle blasts. Explosions. Stirring theme music.
PAN TO Montag waiting for his train. A PAIR OF BEAT COPS in
their urban armor are crossing the platform toward him. They
see his fireman's uniform, pass him with a nod. He nods back.

cur TO:

INT - MOVING MAG-LEV TRAIN - NIGHT

Montag rides the train, paranoia growing. People seem to be
staring at him. He turns away, looks out the window.

cuT To:
EXT - MONTAG'S NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT
Montag walks home, gym bag in hand.

In the far b.g., a POLICE CAR appears, cruising slowly into
the intersection. Montag glances back and keeps walking,
praying the car will continue on through the intersection.

But no, the police car turns, coming this way. Montag keeps
walking, slowly, forcing himself to appear nonchalant. But
the moment he turns the corner...

THE NEXT STREET

..-he breaks into a full run. Feet pounding the pavement, gym
bag flying at his side.

He drops the gym bag. Shit! He skids to a stop, grabs it,
goes darting down the next intersecting street.

A moment later, the police car appears around the corner. The
pedestrian they were tailing is gone. The car accelerates
toward us, LIGHTS FLASHING...

THE NEXT STREET

..as Montag comes running, hearing the police car racing up
toward the intersection behind him.

He dives for cover behind some trash cans lining the sidewalk,
squeezing into the shadows between the cans and a fence.

The police car swerves into view around the corner. Slowing.

SPOTLIGHTS blaze to life as the vehicle comes creeping up the
street toward us, probing the shadows.
 

48.
TIGHT ON MONTAG

as the lights grow brighter, nearer. He's gasping to catch
his breath. Suddenly:

CLARISSE (0.S.)
(whispering)
Don't breathe so loud. They have
microphones.

Montag turns his head. The fence he's squeezed up against is
Clarisse's. He can see her eyes through the cracks in the
boards -- she's crouched on the other side.

The car draws parallel with them, the dazzling glare of the
spotlight probing from the other side of the trash cans.

The car stops. Faint, ghostly RADIO CHATTER spills into the
night. We hear murmurs:

COP #1
I got sound and motion. Something
back there.

Montag's frozen, trying not to move or breathe. Suddenly,
from the other side of the fence comes a MEOW. Clarisse's cat
skitters along the fence in the shadows.

COP #2
Goddamn cat.

The car moves on, spotlight plying the shadows. Montag watches
it disappear down the street. In whispers:

CLARISSE
Why are you hiding?
MONTAG
I did something tonight. Something
very stupid.
CLARISSE
What?
MONTAG

I took some books.

No response at first. He shifts his head so he can see her
more clearly through the slats in the fence. She's watching
him, her face like a porcelain doll's in the moonlight .

CLARISSE
Did you? Did you really?
 

49,

MONTAG
It was stupid. I shouldn't have
done it. And I shouldn't have run
â€˜just now. I'ma fireman, they
wouldn't have searched me. I'm not
thinking clearly. I have to think.

He hugs the gym bag to his chest, mind racing.

CLARISSE
Are you scared?

MONTAG
I'll just give them back. Better
yet, burn them. That's right, that's
what I should do. Just tear out the
pages and burn them myself.

CLARISSE
Yes. That would probably be best.
(pause)
Can I see them?

He hesitates, opens the gym bag, pulls out the books. She
reaches through the slats, fingertips brushing the covers.

CLARISSE
"Charlie the Choo Choo." ,

MONTAG
If they ever found out...if they
knew I had them...

CLARISSE
I won't tell.

Montag's shocked. Her words, so simple, have unlocked a
door...as if she, of all people, had given him permission.

MONTAG
You won't?

CLARISSE
Not anybody. Not ever.

He peers at her through the slats.

MONTAG
Really?

She nods, her expression grave. Montag doesn't know what to
say. He looks down at the books, makes a decision.

He eases "Charlie the Choo Choo" through the slats. Clarisse's
breath catches in her throat. She takes the book, almost afraid
to touch it. She looks to him, unable to believe it.
 

50.

MONTAG
Make sure nobody finds that. I mean
ever, ever. Okay?

She draws the book toward her, but hesitates.

CLARISSE
It's not a trick, is it? You won't
come and burn our house, will you?

MONTAG
No. I won't. I promise.
(beat)
Clarisse. I'm really glad you're my
friend. Really glad. Okay?

CLARISSE
Okay.

And then she's gone, off into the shadows. Montag shoves "Lord
of the Flies" back in his bag, leaves his hiding place...

CUT TO:
INT - MONTAG'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Millie's asleep in the dark. Montag eases onto the bed, still
fully dressed, spoons up next to her. He's uncertain, scared,
needing to hold her. She stirs, groggy, half-asleep, as:

MONTAG
We burned a woman tonight.

MILLIE
You...what? You did what?

MONTAG
An old woman. She had a match. We
didn't see it until it was too late.

MILLIE
So...she killed herself. She was
crazy. A crazy old woman.

MONTAG
Yeah, I guess that's right. A crazy
old woman.

MILLIE

You had me confused.

(rolls away)
Poor Guy. You must be tired. Try
and get some sleep.

She drifts off. Montag holds her a while, then eases to his
side of the bed, mind going a mile-a-minute.
 

 

51.
THE BATHROOM

Montag enters, locks the door. He pulls "Lord of the Flies"
from his gym bag, examining it with fascination. He opens it,
riffles the pages.

MONTAG
Paper. Ink. Words. So what?

He sits, using the toilet for a chair, starts reading the
very first page as we

DISSOLVE TO:
INT - BATHROOM - DAY

The ANGLE hasn't changed, but we find Montag sprawled on the
floor in an exhausted sleep, the book lying nearby.

Sudden POUNDING wrenches him awake. Millie" s muffled VOICE is
heard through the door:

MILLIE (0.S.)
Guy, answer me! Are you all right
in there?

MONTAG
Wha--yeah...yeah, m'all right...

He sits up, trying to get his bearings, reeling from being
jolted from a deep sleep.

MILLIE (0.S.)

What are you doing in there? Open
the door!

His eyes focus, remembering where he is, sees the book lying
on the floor. He grabs it and rises, fighting panic.

MONTAG .
Uh-huh, 'kay, just a minute...

MILLIE (0.S.)

No, now! I mean it! You've been in
there all morning! You got me worried
sick...and I have to pee!

He jams the book in his waistband, hides it with his untucked
shirt. A quick glance in the mirror -- yup, he looks like
hell. He opens the door. Millie muscles past him and makes a
beeline for the toilet, sitting to pee.

IN THE HALLWAY

-+-as Montag moves into the hallway, heart still pounding.
 

52.

MILLIE (0.S.)
Were you in here all night?

MONTAG
Yeah. Sorry. I was throwing up.
I've come down with something.
(beat)
Would you call Captain Beatty and
tell him I'm not coming in?

The DOORBELL RINGS. He starts up the hallway to answer it.

MILLIE (0.S.)
You can tell him yourself. That's
probably him.

..-and he stops in his tracks, fully awake now, staring at
the front door.

MONTAG
What?

We hear the TOILET FLUSH. Millie exits the bathroom, sees
Montag standing there. The DOORBELL RINGS again.

MILLIE
He called twice this morning, said
he was coming over. You gonna answer
it?

He turns, pushes past her toward the bedroom.

MONTAG
No. Tell him I'm sick. Tell him to
go away.

MILLIE
What? I can't tell him that! He's
your boss!

MONTAG

Tell him I'm in bed! I've got chills!
Fever! Just do it!

Off her stunned look, he enters --

THE BEDROOM

-- where he pulls the book and shoves it under his pillow.

He glances through the half-open bedroom door as he peels off
his clothes. He can see Millie at the far end of the hallway
b.g., talking to Beatty at the front door.

She brings him this way. Montag jumps into bed. Moments later,
Beatty enters, trailed tentatively by Millie.
 

53.

CAPTAIN BEATTY
Sorry to hear you're sick.

MONTAG
I wanted to call. Ask for the night
off.

CAPTAIN BEATTY
By all means, take it. Your health
is important.

Beatty pulls up a chair, sits at bedside, eyeing Montag.

CAPTAIN BEATTY
Mrs. Montag. Do take good care of
our boy. Lots of rest, lots of
fluids. We want him hale and hearty.

She circles the bed, playing the good wife, putting on a show
of making Montag more comfortable, straightening the bedding...

MONTAG
That's fine, honey, thanks.

..-but she keeps on fussing, cowed by Beatty's presence as:

CAPTAIN BEATTY
I was worried about you. You and
Dillman. You two seemed to take it
the hardest. You know, he didn't go
home last night.

Montag's distracted and edgy -- now Millie's fluffing the
damn pillows.

MONTAG
Honey, it's fine, okay? Dillman?
What about him?

CAPTAIN BEATTY
He's gone missing. His wife says he
never showed up.
(off Montag's look)
We've notified the police. I do
hope he's okay.

Montag's getting panicky as Millie tries to get at his pillow
to fluff it...

MILLIE
Honey, move your shoulder.

MONTAG
Millie, leave it! It's fine!
 

54.

...and she suddenly freezes, hand under his pillow, shock
creeping into her face. She can feel the book. Quietly:

MONTAG
Honey, the pillow's fine. We're
talking. Please stop fussing.

She pulls her hand away, face slack, trying not to betray
anything. Beatty's watching them both as:

MILLIE
Okay. How about some tea?

MONTAG
That'd be great.

MILLIE
Captain? For you?

CAPTAIN BEATTY
Splendid, thank you.

She moves stiffly to the door and exits. Beatty seems to stare
right through Montag, then:

CAPTAIN BEATTY
I know what's going on.

MONTAG
Oh?

CAPTAIN BEATTY
Some firemen see a woman burn and
think, "well, that happened." They
go home, have dinner, show up for
work the next day. It's not so easy
for others. Some firemen can hit a
snag from time to time. A crisis.
Doubts. Questions. It's ingrained
in the job. That's why I'm here, to
help you through it, if I can.

INT - TV ROOM - DAY
Beatty slots his security card into the TV port.

CAPTAIN BEATTY
Request clearance for private uplink.

VOICE
State name, rank, and division for
voice recognition.

CAPTAIN BEATTY
Beatty, Tiberius, fire captain,
Phoenix Division.
 

55.

VOICE
Uplink approved. Stand by.

Beatty motions for Montag to sit. Montag, in his robe, takes
center seat. Beatty remains standing.

CAPTAIN BEATTY
Where did it begin, you ask, this
thing we do? How did it start?

The TV room comes to life. We're surrounded by images, Montag
and Beatty seemingly transported into the events on screen:

Book burnings. Many of these images were once black & white,
but have since been digitally enhanced and colorized.

CAPTAIN BEATTY
They used to teach this stuff in
the Academy. Gave the rookies a
good grounding in fundamentals. Not
so much anymore. Shame.

As they watch:
Bolsheviks burn decadent capitalist literature.

The Nazi faithful hurl armloads of books onto raging bonfires,
sending geysers of embers swirling into the air.

Southern Baptists torch truckloads of Elvis and Beatles
records, spicing the mix with armloads of "Catcher in the
Rye," "Slaughterhouse Five," "Lolita."

A veritable orgy of flame. Vonnegut. Wilde. Bradbury. Rowling.
Ellison. Shelley. Shaw. Heretics being burned at the stake.

TIGHT ON MONTAG

gazing straight ahead. The images surround him on all sides,
flames flickering across his face and tattooing pinpoints of
fire into his eyes. From Montag's face, WE BOOM UP TO:

CAPTAIN BEATTY
It's nothing new, Montag, what we do.
Admittedly, in the past, it's been
unfocused. Haphazard. Disharmonious.
Various special interest groups trying
to get the better of other special
interest groups whose special interests
they disapproved of. Opinions flying
like hand grenades. Books wielded
like stone clubs to smash one another
over the head with. Pundits flinging
their precious thoughts like apes
flinging feces through the bars of a
cage.
 

 

56.
Dizzying images of mass rallies. Stalin. Hitler.

CAPTAIN BEATTY
Every so often a book would come
along and turn the world on its
ear. Marx and his manifesto. Hitler
and his Kampf. Before you know it,
it wasn't just books being burned.
It was people. Not just a crazy old
woman with a kitchen match, but by
the millions. Entire cities.

(to the TV)
Show me London. Dresden. Tokyo.

Click, click, click -- images of cities being consumed in
massive firebombings.

CAPTAIN BEATTY
Hiroshima. Nagasaki.

Mushroom clouds suddenly rise before Montag's eyes like suns
being born. Beatty's pacing, watching, circling Montag.

CAPTAIN BEATTY
Books are dangerous, Montag. Lethal
in their power. The book burners
had the right idea, of course, but
they never burned right. They burned
to prove some selfish point, not
for the greater goal of harmony and
the good of mankind. And then...then
came the start of this century. And
the beginning of clarity.

Images of 9-11 are shocking in their ferocity. The Twin Towers
burn, tumble, collapse...

CAPTAIN BEATTY
Books were fine once upon a time, back
when there was plenty of room, in the
days of horse and cart. But the world
became far too vast, too complex, too
dangerous. Our agendas could no longer
conflict, not if we were to survive.
Pulling together for a common goal,
that's what was required. Books and
divisive philosophies need not apply.
I won't stomach them for a moment, nor
should you. The stakes were, and are,
far too great.

Millie enters with tea. Beatty takes a cup. The screens depict
increasingly futuristic forms of warfare in a wide variety of
lands. Floating hovertanks. Smarter and smarter bombs.
 

 

57.

CAPTAIN BEATTY
Peace, Montag. Harmony, Montag.
Security, Montag. Happiness.

(to Millie)

That's what everyone wants, isn't
it, dear? Haven't you heard it all
your life? I want to be happy, people
say. Don't you? Doesn't everyone?

MILLIE
Yes. Yes, they do. I'm...I'm happy.

Flustered, Millie offers the tea tray to Montag. He takes his
cup and she hurries out.

CAPTAIN BEATTY
That's us, Montag. The Happiness
Twins. The Dixie Duo, you and I. We
stand against those who want everyone
unhappy and divided. I don't think
you realize how important you are
to the survival of our society.
Recite the first two articles of
faith from the fireman's manual.

MONTAG
"One, books erode the fundamental
precept of our democracy, which is
that all men are created equal. Two,
books are a reflection of one man's
ego, and thus by their very nature
are antisocial and combative."

CAPTAIN BEATTY
My God's better than your God. My
morality is superior to yours. I
disapprove of your life, your
choices, your culture, your politics,
your smell. A book is a loaded gun
in the house next door. So? Into
the incinerator with it. All men
made equal. All men made happy.
Blacks don't like "Little Black
Sambo?" Burn it. Whites are ashamed
of "Uncle Tom's Cabin?" Scorch it.
"Johnny Got His Gun" demoralizing
our troops and hindering the war
effort? Render its ashes unto Caesar,
lest the empire fall.

(sits, faces Montag)

We've been at war since before you
and I were born. You did your
military service as required, and
with distinction. So did I. So must
we all do our parts -- no ifs, ands,

CAPTAIN BEATTY (CONT'D)
or maybes -- or we shall lose
someday. Our country, our people,
our way of life -- that's what's at
stake.

(to the room)
Enough.

The screens go dark, silent. Beatty pulls out his lighter,
flicks it on-off, on-off. Admiring the flame. He looks at
Montag with a twinkle in his eye.

CAPTAIN BEATTY
Tell you a little secret. I've read
a few books in my day. I had doubts,
too, as a younger man. Questions. I
had to know what I was about.

He draws a cigar from his inner pocket, applies the flame.

He puffs the

Montag nods.

Beatty rises

 

CAPTAIN BEATTY
And the more I read, the more I did
know. I came to know the face of my
enemy and the truth of my calling.
Books, dear Montag, say nothing.
They're good for one thing. The
application of heat. Four hundred

and fifty one degrees Fahrenheit, to
be precise.

cigar to life.

MONTAG
So...if a fireman were to...
accidentally...not really intending
anything...

CAPTAIN BEATTY
Take a book home?

His mouth is dry.

CAPTAIN BEATTY

A natural error. Curiosity alone.
We don't get anxious or mad. We let
the fireman keep the book for a day
or two. If he hasn't burned it by
then, well...we simply come and
burn it for him.

(off Montag's look)
Fire is bright, and fire is clean.
Feel better, my boy. I hope to see
you back before too long.

and exits past Millie hovering in the doorway.
 

 

59.

CAPTAIN BEATTY
Thank you for the tea.

MILLIE
Bye.

They stay frozen: Montag in the chair, Millie in the doorway.
They listen as Beatty goes to the front door and exits.
Montag turns, looks to Millie. She's seething.

: MILLIE
Goddamn you.

She darts from view toward the bedroom. Everything that follows
is HANDHELD, continuous:

Montag jumps up, out of the TV room, down the hallway, into
the bedroom, where Millie's ripping the bedding away, hurling
it to the floor, grabbing the book, colliding with Montag as
he tries to calm her, but she's beyond that, hysterical...

MILLIE
Are you crazy? Are you insane? What
is wrong with you?

MONTAG
Millie, please, listen--

MILLIE
Get away from me!

..and she's up the hallway, into the bathroom, slams the
door in his face. WE HOLD ON Montag in the hallway as:

MONTAG
Millie!

MILLIE (0.S.)
Leave me alone!

MONTAG
What are you doing in there?

MILLIE (0.S.)
Not listening to you! Go away!

MONTAG
(beat, trying to be calm)
Millie. Honey. Please don't hurt
the book.

MILLIE (0.S.)
You bastard! I'm burning it!
 

 

60.

MONTAG
You're what?

MILLIE (0.S.)
I got a lighter from the kitchen!
I'm burning it!

MONTAG
Millie, don't! I mean it!
(pounds on the door)
Millie!

No response. Montag backs up a step and delivers a brutal
kick. The door bursts open, lock splintering the jamb.

CAMERA FOLLOWS into the bathroom, jarring and chaotic, Millie
at the sink, stunned and fearful, book blazing up in her hand.
He snatches the flaming book from her, slaps the flame out.

Montag's clenched, furious, tightly reined. We've never seen
him pissed before, but it looks like he could do some damage.
He pulls off the charred dustjacket, flings it.

MONTAG
You call this a burn? It's a joke.
Kerosene and a flamethrower. That's
how you burn.
(riffling pages)
Or rip 'em out and burn 'em one by
one. That what you want? Is it?

MILLIE
Yes! That's what I want!

CAMERA FOLLOWS Montag from the bathroom, down the hallway...

MONTAG
â€˜kay, fine, but it's not the only
thing we should burn around here.

MILLIE
(at his heels)
What are you talking about?

MONTAG
If we're gonna burn, let's do it
right! Start with that room, those
goddamn talking walls!

..-and into the TV room, trailed by Millie.

MILLIE
Listen to you, you're not making
sense! It's that book that's done
it to you, that book...it's not
real! Books aren't real!
 

 

61.

MONTAG
(indicates room)
And this is?

MILLIE
It is! It's got light, and sound,
and people laughing and talking and
saying my name...

MONTAG
I_say your name, Millie. I say it
all the time. Do you hear it? or
just the goddamn "people" in the
walls? Them, your "family."
(closing on her)
Do they love you, Millie? Do they
hold you at night and listen to you
sleep? Do they lie awake and worry
about how many pills you took, is
that why they say your name?
(shouting)
OR IS IT BECAUSE YOUR NAME'S
PROGRAMMED INTO OUR GODDAMN TV?

MILLIE
(crying, helpless)
I don't know what you want from me! I
don't know what's happening to you!

Montag pauses, calming, getting a grip. His own rage has
stunned him, left him shaking.

MONTAG
You weren't there. You didn't see â€˜
her. The woman we burned.

MILLIE
The crazy woman?

MONTAG
She didn't seem crazy.

MILLIE
She was! And she's made you crazy
too, with this, this thing...

She grabs the book from his hands. He stares at it, emotions
teetering and torn.

MILLIE
Did you read this?

MONTAG
Last night. The whole thing.

MONTAG (CONT'D)
(off her shock)
I...didn't understand it. I mean,
it seemed simple enough, but...1I
couldn't figure out the reason for
it.

MILLIE
There isn't one! Captain Beatty was
right! There's nothing in it! Nothing
to understand!

CAMERA FOLLOWS her out the door, up the hallway, Montag at
her heels...

MONTAG
Where you going?

MILLIE
The kitchen incinerator!

MONTAG
Millie, no!

-,-and he tries to grab her but she fights him off, slapping
wildly, hysteria and terror breaking like a wave...

MILLIE
I'M NOT LISTENING TO YOU! I'M NOT!
THEY'RE GONNA COME AND BURN US,
GONNA BURN EVERYTHING, BECAUSE OF
YOU, BECAUSE YOU'VE GONE CRAZY!

---and she keeps going but Montag grabs her around the waist,
grappling as she screams, and they trip, fall to the floor...

TIGHTER ANGLE

-,-where the fight goes out of her and she goes limp under
his weight, her rage giving way to helpless tears:

MILLIE
They're gonna come burn us. I live
here too. Please.

MONTAG
Millie, shhh, it's okay.

His grip goes gentle, caressing now, stroking her hair. She's
weeping, twisting away from his touch, not looking at him.

MONTAG
They're not gonna burn us, okay? I
swear. Shhh.
 

 

63.

MILLIE
They are. They are. Why are you
doing this?

TIGHT, TIGHT TWO SHOT
as he whispers in her ear, desperate:

MONTAG
Millie. I sometimes feel like I've
forgotten something important.
Something I was supposed to hold
onto really tight...but I lost it,
without thinking, like a kid loses
something, and I forgot I ever even
had it to start with...

MILLIE
That's stupid. You're stupid, you're
not making sense.

MONTAG
You remember where we met, Millie?
How long ago? Do you remember what
I said? Do you remember what you
said? What you were wearing? Or
have the pills taken all that away?
Can you remember?

MILLIE

Course I remember. Stupid jerk.
MONTAG

Tell me.
MILLIE

No. Go away.

Montag eases off, seeing the truth. She doesn't remember. He

takes the book gently from her hand and sits up, his back
against the hallway wall.

MONTAG

Yesterday, I saw a woman burn
herself, and I thought, my God.
What's in these books that could
make a person do that? Is it because
she's crazy? Or because she isn't?
I deserve to know that.

{looks to her)
I love you, Millie. And I want you
to help me. If the book says nothing,
we'll burn it together. Okay?

Millie also sits up, her back against the opposite wall. (Two
facing profiles.) He opens the book, starts to read:
 

 

64.

MONTAG

"Chapter one. The Sound of the Shell.
(beat)

The boy with the fair hair lowered
himself down the last few feet of
rock and began to pick his way toward
the lagoon. Though he had taken off
his school sweater and trailed it
now from one hand..."

CAMERA CLOSES IN TIGHTER AND TIGHTER on Millie in profile as
Montag's voice drones on, her head bowed, tears slipping off
her nose. She's trembling, trying to hold very still.

MONTAG
",,.when a bird, a vision of red
and yellow, flashed upwards with a
witch-like cry; and this cry was
echoed by another..."

Millie rises abruptly from frame, goes down the hallway past
Montag, vanishes into the TV room, slams the door.

HOLD ON Montag. Listening. The TV goes on, turned way up loud.

Montag sags, the breath draining from his body, the life
seeming to go out of him as:

THE BOOK (SLO-MO)

slips from his hand, tumbling toward the floor...
CUT TO:

INT - FIREHOUSE - NIGHT

-..and the book lands before us, normal speed, whacking a
table top. ANGLE UP TO:

Beatty, seated in a poker game, surrounded by firemen. He
looks up from the book to:

MONTAG
I found this in the Scooper.

CUT TO:
INT - INCINERATOR - NIGHT
PILOT FLAMES BLOOM with a gentle hiss. The door opens,
revealing Beatty and Montag, faces awash in the glow. Montag

lays "Lord of the Flies" inside, cranks the jets. An ERUPTION
OF FLAME leaps up, engulfing the screen...

DISSOLVE TO:
 

65.
EXT - HOMELESS ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT

..-and FLAMES engulf the screen, transitioning from fire to
fire on the dissolve, roiling in SLO-MO. The fire sweeps aside,
revealing Montag and his flame thrower, finger on the trigger,
face caked with soot.

ANGLE WIDENS as he moves through a surreal, flaming landscape,
igniting piles of books, laundry on lines, makeshift tents.

Other firemen are revealed as we WIDEN, also burning. Jets of
fire streak across frame. FIREBALLS billow into the sky.

THE HOMELESS

are leaving with what they can carry, lines of ragged people
being walked through checkpoints. Some Mechanical Hounds are
there, sniffing them all to make sure no books get through.

MONTAG

pauses. At his feet are piles of debris -- a child's armless
doll, a dented metal teapot. He kicks some crap aside, and:

Books. Hidden hastily beneath. Just part of the garbage.

Montag glances around. Nobody can see him out here in all the
confusion and smoke. He grabs the books, stuffs them inside
his coat. Gone like a magic trick, poof, just like that. He
moves on, laying down a blast of FLAME as he goes...

CUT TO:
INT - MONTAG'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

-.-and we find him in the bathroom, reading late into the
night, a few books at his feet...

CUT TO:
INT - AN OLD MANSION - NIGHT

...and he comes up a corridor, shouting instructions as walls

are ripped out. And as he turns the corner he performs another
magic trick, scooping books from the torn-out walls and making
them disappear. He keeps moving, nerves steady -- as with any

life of crime, once begun, it gets easier every time...

cur TO:
INT - BATHROOM - NIGHT.

+--and the books grow in number as the hours grow late...

CUT TO:
 

 

66.
EXT - BACKYARD OF OLD MANSION - NIGHT
A search-line of FIREMEN led by Montag crosses a weedy yard
past crumbling stone statues and mute tile fountains, sweeping
the ground with IMAGING DETECTORS. The screens begin FLASHING.
Montag turns, hollers, motioning for the Scooper...

TIMECUT:
.--which rips up a huge mound of dirt and backs away, the
falling dirt revealing packets of books wrapped in heavy
plastic, buried here for countless decades...

Montag hollers for the pumpers and men scurry off. As they
go, he comes forward, crouches to the dirt...

.-and digs out a single book, ancient and ornate, wrapped in
heavy plastic sheet...

CUT TO:
INT - MONTAG'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

..-which he carefully slices with a razor, peeling it away to
reveal a beautiful Bible, stunningly old and rare...

INT - MONTAG'S ATTIC CRAWLSPACE - NIGHT
--.and Montag pokes up through a small trapdoor, lays down

the Bible...as ANGLE PULLS BACK to reveal the crawlspace dotted
with stacks of books, dozens of them...

CUT TO:
INT - BUILDINGS, VARIOUS - NIGHT
.-.and BLASTS OF FLAME are unleashed and unleashed again,
sailing up corridors, up staircases, though rooms; exploding,
writhing, funneling, roaring...

CUT TO:
INT - BATHROOM - NIGHT

...and again we find Montag reading. The bathroom has become
his late night refuge. CAMERA CLOSES IN on his face...

---and we hear a SOFT KNOCK. His gaze snaps up.

MONTAG
What?

MILLIE (0.S.)
Something outside. I'm scared.
 

 

67.

Montag wraps his book in a towel, slips it under the sink. He
rises to the door and opens it a crack, revealing:

MILLIE
First I thought I was dreaming. It
was outside the window, moving around
in the flower bed. Then I heard it
scratching at the door. I think it
was some kind of animal. Like a dog.

Montag joins her in the hallway and holds still, listening.
Is that a sound out there? A trash can lid? The wind?

He moves through the dark house to the living room, Millie
lagging fearfully behind.

He goes to the window, eases his fingers through the blinds,
opens them a crack. There, outside in the moonlight:

MONTAG
(whispers)
It's a Hound.

Millie's breath catches.

MILLIE
They're coming for us. They're gonna
burn us.

MONTAG
No. It's moving off.
(beat)
We send them out sometimes on slow
nights. Check out the neighborhoods.
Let them sniff around. It's random.

She stares at him, not convinced.

She turns without a further word, disappears to the bedroom.
Montag peers out again, perhaps not so convinced himself...

CUT TO:
INT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Montag wakes to darkness, Millie beside him. He lies for a
long moment, staring at nothing, wondering what woke him.

He becomes aware of a RISING ORANGE GLOW in the room. He sits
up, the glow intensifying on his face. He jumps out of bed,
rushes to the window...

..-wWhere leaping flames are reflected in the glass.

CUT TO:
 

 

68.
EXT - MONTAG'S STREET - NIGHT
CAMERA FOLLOWS Montag running barefoot in his pajama bottoms,
coming up the sidewalk, elbowing through knots of spectators,
passing a firetruck...
He stops, and CAMERA COMES AROUND TO REVEAL:

Clarisse's house in flames. Fireballs rising. Men on the lawn
with flamethrowers.

He hears a YOWL and looks down as an orange cat streaks by,
disappearing through the legs of the crowd.

PIREMAN #1
Sir, please move back to the
barricades!

MONTAG

(flashes his ID tags)
Montag. District four. I live a few
houses down.

FIRE CAPTAIN
(looks over)

Some neighbors you had. Just never
know, I guess.

He's idly paging a book in his hands. Montag glances down
and, with a jolt, realizes it's "Charlie the Choo Choo."

The captain moves off, tosses it onto a roaring pyre of other
books.

MONTAG
Are they in custody?

FIREMAN #2
Drove off five minutes before we
got here. Probably saw the Hound
sniffing the neighborhood. Don't
worry, cops'll get 'em.

He moves off. Montag is left staring at the flames.

CUT TO:
INT - MONTAG'S KITCHEN - DAY

Montag watches as Millie lays breakfast on the table. The
tension between them is thick. Finally:

MILLIE
Get rid of the books. I mean it.

CUT TO:
 

 

69.
EXT - STREET - DAY

Montag stands staring at Clarisse's house, collar turned up
against the chill. It's quiet now, not a soul in sight. Little
of the house remains. Charred timbers and ashes.

CuT TO:
INT - FIREHOUSE - DAY
Arriving for work, Montag gets waved into Beatty's office:

CAPTAIN BEATTY

I was skimming the city reports
from last night.

(nods to his computer)
Had some excitement out your way?
Just a few doors down, was it?

(Montag nods)
Rang up Jeffers at third district.
He said you showed up barefoot in
pajamas. Ready to pitch in and lend
a hand, were you?

MONTAG
Always, Captain. You know that.

Beatty, affable, turns his screen so Montag can see it. The
plasma image shows the faces of Clarisse's family. Father.
Mother. Cousins. Beatty taps down, idly scanning...

CAPTAIN BEATTY

This file goes back generations. A
long line of misfits and oddballs.
They were even homeschooling the
daughter, you imagine? Stunning,
the crap they got away with, wearing
the masks of normal people.

(beat)
Ever meet them?

A loaded question, posed casually. Montag knows it, too. He
keeps his tone conversational:

MONTAG
Waved to the man over the fence
once. And the little girl...

Clarisse's face appears on screen.

MONTAG
---that's the one. Said hello to me
one night. She was odd.
(off Beatty's look)
Said there was a man in the moon.
 

 

70.
Beatty blinks and laughs, nonplussed. Montag exits...
CUT TO:
INT - FIREHOUSE - NIGHT

-.+.and we find him later at a desk amid the quiet activity of
the firehouse, studying the same report that Beatty had pulled
up earlier. Checking out Clarisse's family. He pauses as:

A new face comes up. The name: "David Faber." Uncle.

The photo's a mugshot. The man's got quite a rapsheet. Montag
â€˜scans down the list of arrests, words flashing onscreen:

Antisocial. Unpatriotic. Agitator. Anarchist. Political
undesirable. Worst of all: "Convicted of harboring books."

MONTAG
Current whereabouts?

The computer responds instantly with an address.

CUT TO:
EXT - TENEMENT - DAY

DAVID FABER ventures out into an dismal, overcast day. He
turns up his overcoat collar and crosses the street.

ANGLE SHIFTS TO Montag. He steps off the curb to follow.

cur To:
EXT - CITY PARK - DAY

Faber's alone at a chess table, the top faded and old, playing
solo. Every so often he tosses some crumbs to the birds.

He becomes aware of Montag some distance away. Faber gives
him a glance or two, tries to ignore him.

Montag comes this way. Faber tosses the last of the crumbs,
sweeps his chess pieces into a bag, gets up to leave.

MONTAG
Mr. Faber? Wait.

FABER
(quickens his pace)
I haven't done anything. I'm trying
to live my life. Please leave me
alone.

MONTAG
I want to talk to you!
 

 

721.

FABER
Talk to my probation officer, I
a report to him every other day.
MONTAG

Please--slow down!

FABER

(stops, turns)
Look, Mr. Fireman, sir -- I did my
time, okay?

(shows his barcode number

_ tattoo)
Five years in the re-education camp.
I've paid my debt to society. So...

He keeps going, Montag dogging him:

MONTAG
You're Clarisse's uncle.

FABER
I'm her father's uncle. What's it
to you? What do you know about

Clarisse?
MONTAG
We were friends. She talked about
~ you.
FABER
Oh, please...
MONTAG

She told me you got arrested once
for being a pedestrian.

FABER
Proves nothing. Says so in my file.

MONTAG
And you told her that firemen used
to put out fires a long time ago.

FABER
They did. Still proves nothing.

MONTAG
Look, Mr. Faber, I--

Faber whirls on him, shouting:

FABER
It's not enough you people burned
them out and set them on the run?
(MORE)
 

72.

FABER (CONT'D)
They're gone and I have no idea
where! Same as I told those other
men last night, the ones with the
warrants! And now you know! So,
please, just let me go my way!

 

Faber hurries off, leaving Montag standing there...
CUT TO:
INT - FABER'S TENEMENT - LATE DAY

..-but Montag's not giving up. He enters the building. It's
overcrowded and squalid. KIDS are yelling in the hallways,
laundry is strung from the landings.

He passes loud music, loud Tvs, loud arguments spilling from
various apartments. Some people notice him, a few doors slam.

He goes past a young, tired-looking WHORE in her doorway, her
robe hanging open, smoking and checking him out.

WHORE
Hey, baby, looking for company?
(calls after him)
I love firemen! Do you right!

Montag comes to the stairs and finds a MAN sitting in a chair
with a shotgun across his knees -- the building's day guard.
Montag shows him his Fire Department I.D.

MONTAG
Faber?

INT - FABER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Faber's in his strappy t-shirt, riding a stationary bicycle.
It's not a workout -- the bike's connected by electrical leads
to a series of old car batteries that Faber is charging.

A KNOCK at the door. Faber gets off the bike, breathing hard,
toweling sweat from his face.

FABER
Who is it?

MONTAG (0.S.)
We met in the park.

FABER
Veys mir. Look, I told you, unless
you have a warrant--

MONTAG
I do.
 

 

Faber sighs, opens the door, peers out.

FABER
Show me.

Montag raises his gym bag into view.

FABER
Looks heavy. For a warrant.

MONTAG
dust give me a few minutes, okay?
Please. This visit's unofficial.

FABER
Do I have a choice, I asked? I'm
guessing not, I answered. Okay, Mr.
Pest. You intrigue me.
(swings the door open)
Enter freely and of your own will.

Montag enters. Faber crosses to the sink:

FABER
Pardon my sweat. Close to dinner
time. I was charging the batteries
for the stove.
(grabs a glass)
ww I offer you something? An aperitif?
A glass of slime from the tap?

MONTAG
No thanks.

Faber pours himself some water.

FABER
Well then. Formalities are done.
Who are you, what do you want?

MONTAG
I'm Montag. Your nephew's family
lived on my street.

FABER
Oh, you're that fireman, the one
down the street. Ah. You turned in
the alarm, of course.

 

MONTAG
No. I told you, Clarisse was my
friend.

Faber goes to the table, sits.

73.
 

 

Montag moves

74.

FABER
And so you'd like to know where
they are, check up on her, see she's
safe. And I'm supposed to fall for
that. I have to say, you guys used
to be more clever than this.

MONTAG
I don't want to know where they
are. I just...if you ever get the
chance, please let her know how
sorry I am and that it wasn't me.

FABER
That's all?
(Montag nods)
I won't get the chance. But your
sentiment is duly noted. We done?

to the table, lays his gym bag before Faber.
FABER

A loaf of bread? A jug of wine?
Dirty gym clothes? I give up.

Montag unzips the bag, pulls out something thick and heavy.

Paber's eyes

widen as he realizes what it is -- the ancient,

ornate Bible Montag dug out of the ground. For a long moment
the man forgets to breathe, deeply stunned.

FABER
And this is?

MONTAG
For you.

FABER

For me. I see.

(clears his throat)
The Revised Testament, government
approved version, is one of the few
books not on the burning list. This,
however, appears to be New Testament,
done by hand prior to the invention of
the printing press. It's very old and
beyond rare, which means the Pope himself
would gladly light the match. I'm sorry,
but I can't accept your gift, seeing as
how very illegal it is.

 

Montag starts pulling more books from his bag, stacking them

on the table.

Faber's eyes start to glaze.

FABER
What the hell is this?
 

75.

MONTAG
I can't keep any of it. I was hoping
you could find a home for them.

FABER

Too bad one of them isn't a
dictionary, we could look up the
word "entrapment." Along with the
word "sucker."

{off Montag's look)
How stupid do I look? You're trying
to get me burned out! Not to mention
sent back for re-education, only
this time for life! Having been
there, I'm compelled to say no. But
don't think I didn't appreciate the
attempt. It was very amusing.

(rises, shooing him)
Gather your things and go. Out,
out, out. Thanks for the laugh.

Montag stands up, thinks a moment. He then stuns Faber by
opening the Bible and ripping out the first page.

FABER
What are you doing?

Montag pulls a lighter from his pocket, clicks it. A tiny jet
of BLUE FLAME leaps up. He holds up the page and ignites it.

The page curls and burns before Faber's eyes. He watches the
ashes swirl toward the ceiling as:

Montag rips the second page out, holds it up. Faber's aghast:

FABER
What --are--you--doing? Are you
crazy?
MONTAG
(mutters)

You and my wife.

Montag applies the flame. The second page burns. More ashes
swirl. He reaches for the third page...

FABER
No, no, wait--

MONTAG
I told you I can't keep it. That
leaves us two choices--

FABER
--us, us? How'd this turn into us--
 

 

76.

. MONTAG
--you take the books, or I do my
job. This is what I do. Watch.

And he rips the third page out, raises it, brings the lighter
close. The page starts to blacken and burn.

MONTAG
Up it goes.

Faber stifles a scream. He lunges and grabs the page, slapping
it to the table, smothering it.

FABER
Goddamn it, stop! Just stop it!

He snatches up the Bible and backs away, clutching it to his

chest.

Pause. Faber

FABER
Idiot! Sadist! This could be the
last Christian Bible in this

hemisphere!

MONTAG
Are you Christian?

FABER
I'ma Jew!

MONTAG

Then what do you care?

FABER

I care, I care! It's us, it's who
we are, it's who we were!

(off Montag's look)
That's why this world sucks, kiddo!
We don't know who to be. anymore,
because we don't know where we came
from or how we got here, or the
mistakes we made along the way! It's
all been erased and we've forgotten
how to even ask the damn questions!
All we know is what they tell us,
that parade of shitwits on TV, that's
become our excuse for truth!

 

looks down at the Bible in his hands. Softly:

FABER
Look at these pages. How many
believers spent their lives going
blind in some dark abbey copying
them by hand...so you can burn them
in seconds?
 

 

77.

He can't resist -- he raises it to his nose, inhales.
FABER
God. I can smell the centuries.
(beat)

Go ahead. Call in your alarm. I'm
not giving this back.

Montag meets Faber's defiant gaze. He's seen that look once
before, in the eyes of an old woman holding a kitchen match.

MONTAG
I have more books at home. A few
dozen in my attic. I'll bring them
to you the next few days. Unless
you decide to turn me in, of course.
Guess I'll just have to trust you.

Faber stares at him, stunned, as we

EXT - TENEMENT ROOF - DUSK

The roof is a jumble of electricity-generating windmills
spinning on the breeze, plus a maze of chicken and rabbit
coops. The view is spectacular in the gathering twilight, air
traffic whizzing, the last traces of sunset filtering amazing
colors through the poisoned air.

FABER (0.S.)
What's a book? Just a person who
lived, that's all. Somebody who
wanted to tell you something and
cared enough to write it down.

BOOMING DOWN, we find Faber and Montag seated on a low stone
wall separating one level of the roof from another. Faber's
got one of Montag's books in his hands, turning the pages:

FABER
Good books, bad books...they're
just voices asking to be heard.
They're us.

MONTAG
My wife says books aren't real.

FABER
She's right, thank God! You can
shut 'em up, you can close 'em, you
can say "hold on a moment!" They
piss you off, you can even throw
â€˜em across the room. But in all my
years I have never been able to

reason with a TV set. Ever try to
argue with a four-wall plasma screen
room with a zillion channels and
surround sound? Can't be done! All
you can do is submit!

{to the sky)
I surrender! Tell me what kind of
toilet paper to use, I'll do it!

Montag iaughs. Faber rises, agitated:

FABER .
You can laugh, kiddo, but there's
your truth. From the Jesuit priest
who burned the great Mayan library
so the natives would only have Jesus
to think about, to the invading
armies who burned the Library at
Alexandria three times -- three
times -- there's always some schmuck
who wants to take away your right
to think for yourself.

 

 

MONTAG
History begins with me?

FABER

My God, a quote yet. Yes, O Learned
Sage, history begins with me.

(hefts the book)
And don't bother showing up with
your own ideas, just take the ones
we give you. Or we'll accuse you of
treason. Heresy. Burn you. Bury you
in mass graves. Kick your ass.

Faber draws closer, hands the book to Montag.

FABER
It's not even about books. It's about
control. The people who run things
keeping themselves in power by making
sure nobody knows enough to ask
uncomfortable questions. Keep the TVs
going and the trivia flowing! Who's
dating who, who's wearing what, will
the pop star get married, will she get
divorced, what's happening on "The
Family" this week? A river of meaningless
shit flooding our brains twenty four
hours a day until we've got no brains
left! That's power, kiddo. On a mass
scale. Intractable, entrenched,
unassailable. And, I'm sorry to say, it
sums up the lie your life has been.

 
 

79.

Faber's suddenly feeling shaky. He turns, gazing out over the
city, trying to steady himself.

MONTAG
You all right?

FABER

You kidding me? I'm terrified.
Lightheaded. I can't believe I'm
even talking to you.

(feels his own forehead)
I didn't have enough trouble. Mr.
Lunatic shows up. Idiot me, I open
the door and say come in. What do
you want, Mr. Lunatic? Speak!

MONTAG
(rises)
I thought we could help each other.

FABER

(laughs)
Don't bullshit yourself, kiddo. It's
unseemly. You're a book-burner who
woke up one day and realized you
aren't quite the mindless robot they
told you to be. You've fallen from
grace, you poor sap, and now you

~ want absolution. All those heretics

you've burned at the stake. Whitman.
Thoreau. Dickens. Well, I don't do
absolution. Try the Catholics.

(heads for the coops)
Anyway, you're a little late. Where
were you twenty, thirty years ago?
Back when I had piss and vinegar to
spare?

MONTAG
Maybe you still do.

FABER
That was then. I've since had my
ass handed to me once or twice. All
I wanna do now is sleep through the
night.

INSIDE THE COOP MAZE

Faber comes down the tunnel of cages, unlocks one. THREE
CHICKENS squawk as he gathers eggs into a kitchen towel.

FABER
Charlotte. Emily. Anne. Thank you,
my darlings. Another night I don't
starve because of you.
 

 

80.

Montag appears on the other side, peering through the mesh as
Faber moves down the row to another cage.

MONTAG
Everybody knows there's a resistance
Movement. You were a part of it.
I'm not saying you still are. I'm
just saying maybe you know. somebody
who knows somebody.

FABER
Why? What do you think the resistance
is, some well-oiled army ready to
rise up and smite the wicked? It's
little old ladies and people like
me, hiding books in the shadows and
shitting a brick every time the
doorbell rings.

Faber emerges from the tunnel of cages, rejoins Montag.

FABER
That's all it's ever been. We're
like those monks in the Dark Ages,
hiding books so the kings and popes
can't burn 'em. Hoping someday
knowledge might be welcome again.

 

MONTAG
I can get you those books.

FABER
Is that what this is about?

A formation of high-level BOMBERS go streaking across the
sky, tearing the stratosphere with sound. Faber looks up.

FABER
See the news this morning? We started
using nukes. Pakistan's glowing.
Genie's out of the bottle again, kiddo.
Think we'll survive the summer? Me, I
wouldn't bet on getting through the
week. And you're worried about books.

A look passes between them.
MONTAG
You've been pissed off all your
life, old man. You gonna quit now?

Paber weighs this madness, sighs.

INT - BASEMENT OF TENEMENT - NIGHT

Dank and musty, lit by a single bare bulb. Faber's puttering
in semi-darkness, going through various drawers and toolboxes,
fingers rooting piles of screws, nails, parts.

He finds what he's looking for, holds it to the light, blows
dust off -- it's a "seashell," a tiny earplug/transmitter.

FABER
You think I'm old. Hope this thing
still works.
(hands it to Montag)
Stick it in your ear.

Montag slips it into his left ear, finds a comfortable fit.
Faber pulls out a transmitter the size of a pack of cigarettes

and a corresponding headset. He clips the transmitter to his
belt, plugs in the headset, puts it on. Softly:

FABER
Hear me?
MONTAG
(startled)

Yeah. In my head.

FABER

And I can hear you. They built 'em
good back then. Now listen, no more
showing up at my door. From now on
we're never seen together and we
never talk on the phone. We stay in
touch only with this...

(taps his headset)
.-.like two tin cans and a string.

MONTAG
Understood.

FABER
(beat)
Good luck, Mr. Fireman. Try not to
get me burned.

cut To:
INT - FIREHOUSE - NIGHT

STEADICAM brings Montag into the firehouse, past men polishing
the truck, past others performing maintenance duties, past
the brass poles, past the Hound.

It all looks surreal to him. He's seeing it with different
eyes now. He steps to the timeclock, hand on the scanner
 

82.

MONTAG
Montag. Clocking in.

...and as he turns, ANGLE SHIFTS TO REVEAL:
Beatty standing there. Blocking his way. Smiling.

CAPTAIN BEATTY
You're late.

Before Montag can utter a word: WHONK!WHONK!WHONK! The fire
alarm. Deafening.

CAPTAIN BEATTY
Well, nevermind, just in time! Thank
goodness, it's just not a fire
without you!
(turns, yelling)
GO, GO, GO!

VARIOUS ANGLES

Firemen running, boots all a-scuffle, grabbing HELMETS off
pegs, yanking equipment from storage lockers, cascading down
brass poles, swarming the Salamander, strapping in...

EXT - FIREHOUSE - NIGHT

...and emerging into the night, firetruck and control van,
HORNS BLARING AND LIGHTS FLASHING.

ON THE MOVING SALAMANDER

A dizzy blur of motion and lights. Beatty looks back, checking
the faces of his men.

CAPTAIN BEATTY
Montag, where's that grin?

MONTAG
Sir?

CAPTAIN BEATTY
The fierce grin of all men singed
and driven back by flame! Isn't
this what we love? Isn't this what
we do best?

EXT - SUBURBAN STREET - NIGHT

A HOVERCOPTER is circling as the Salamander comes rumbling up
the street. The firetruck stops.

CAMERA CLOSES IN as the firemen unbuckle, some of them jumping
down, others pausing uncertainly...
 

83.

CARILLO
Sir? Is this our jurisdiction?

CAPTAIN BEATTY
No worries. I've cleared it through
channels.

...and Beatty glances back as CAMERA CONTINUES PAST HIM,
closing on Montag. He's at a loss, trying to comprehend:

MONTAG
We...we've stopped in front of my
house.

REVERSE ANGLE

Montag's house sits on its quiet street. The firemen start to
assemble a bit awkwardly, not sure what's going on, but:

CAPTAIN BEATTY
At ease. We're dispensing with
protocol. Tonight is a special
occasion. Tonight we do things just
a little differently.
(glances up to Montag)
Isn't that right?

Feeling like a man in a dream, Montag steps down and walks
forward to face Beatty.

CAPTAIN BEATTY

(announcing to all)
No pumpers! No kerosene! No pretty
beacon on the lawn! Tonight we get
a special treat! A display of
dedication and skill nonpareil! One
man! One flamethrower!

(locks eyes with Montag)
Mr. Ormsby! Mr. Landers! Bring one
down, if you please!

Ormsby and Landers heft a flamethrower off its mount and bring
it down from the truck, hustling it over as:

The front door of the house bursts open and Millie hurries
down the walk, dressed for travel and dragging a suitcase.

MONTAG
She turned in the alarm?

CAPTAIN BEATTY
Don't blame her, Montag, not for
your stupidity.

Montag, stunned, meets her as she reaches the curb. She's all
exried out, looking back at the house:
 

 

84.

MILLIE
Everything gone now, everything.
Poor house. Poor family. All gone.

Montag steps close, desperate, hoping for some glimmer of
tenderness or redemption.

MONTAG
Millie. I love you.

She looks him in the eye and:

MILLIE
(softly)
I hope you die.

She brushes past him as Beatty remands her to the TWO COPS on
the scene:

CAPTAIN BEATTY
Officers. A domestic dispute. Would
you please see after Mrs. Montag?
Take her where she wants to go?

As Millie is helped away, Beatty snaps his fingers at Ormsby
and Landers. They sling the flamethrower onto Montag's back,
tightening straps and snapping buckles as:

CAPTAIN BEATTY
Don't look so shocked. You didn't
leave her much choice, did you?
Poor thing was terrified. It was
the third alarm she called in. I
ignored the first two, told her to
be patient. Said you'd come around.
What a sad disappointment you are.
How are those straps, secure? Let's
get that pilot lit.

Montag activates the gas feed. Beatty himself applies the
igniter. A gentle flame blooms.

CAPTAIN BEATTY
Now. Let's finish what you started.

They march toward the house, Beatty and Montag, as the others
watch. Beatty turns back, calling to them... .

CAPTAIN BEATTY
Break out some windows! Let's get
some cross ventilation!

--and in that moment, Montag sneaks the "seashell" from his

pocket and slips it in his ear.
 

 

85.
INT - FABER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Faber reacts as his transmitter activates with a small red
light and a BRIEF TONE. He grabs the unit, slips on the headset
with a smile.

FABER
What's on your mind, kiddo?

INT - MONTAG'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Montag, of course, can't reply. He enters the house with
Beatty, gazing around to find that Millie's taken the books
from the attic and strewn them all over the floor.

FABER'S VOICE (0.S.)
(filtered)
Hello? Hello?

MONTAG
I can't believe this is happening
to me.

CAPTAIN BEATTY
Funny how that works. Everybody
thinks, everybody is absolutely
certain, that nothing will ever
happen to them. Others die, I go
on. Others get caught, not me.
Consequences? Never. Except sometimes
there are. And by the time they
catch up, it's too late.

INT - FABER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
TIGHT ON Faber, heart sinking as he listens.

FABER
Montag. I'm listening. I don't know
what's happening, but I'm here.

INT - MONTAG'S HOUSE - NIGHT

WINDOWS START BREAKING from outside, glass exploding across
floors. CAMERA CLOSES IN TIGHTER AND TIGHTER ON MONTAG as:

. CAPTAIN BEATTY
You're a well read man, how about a
few well-chosen quotes? No? Allow
me. "Day of wrath, O day of mourning!
See fulfilled the prophet's warning!
Heaven and earth in ashes burning!"
(bellows)
DO IT!
 

 

86.

Montag hits the trigger and FIRES A BLAST OF FLAME into the
living room, igniting the furniture. WHOOOOOOSH!

CAPTAIN BEATTY
AGAIN!

WHOOOOOOSH! The living room walls now catch, sending up sheets
of fire. Books on the floor ignite.

CAPTAIN BEATTY
That's the ticket, well done! You
can't tell me that didn't feel good!
All your sins washed away with good
cleansing fire! Onward, Montag!
Lead the way!

 

Montag leads Beatty down the hallway into:
THE TV ROOM
It's on, of course. "The Family" is playing.

CAPTAIN BEATTY
Something here you'd like to burn?
The sorrow of past regrets? The
stench of failure? That blow-dried
imbecile and his chattering hag?

Montag pulls the trigger. The FIRE BURSTS FORTH, hitting the
screens and imploding them. The vacuum sucks fire in and
belches it out again, plastic igniting as the babble of the
Family gives way to the HIDEOUS SHRIEK OF MELTING SPEAKERS.

THE BEDROOM: Montag stares at the bed he shared for years
with his wife. WHOOOQOOSH! Up it goes, a funeral pyre...

THE KITCHEN: WHOOOOOSH! Table, countertop, appliances -- gone...

THE HALLWAY: A flaming corridor. Beatty and Montag retreat to
the front door, Montag laying down BLASTS OF FLAME...

EXT - HOUSE - NIGHT

-..and they emerge coughing, dark with soot, as the house
behind them burns. They turn to watch.

CAPTAIN BEATTY
(gentle)
Bad dream's over. Fire and smoke.

INT - FABER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
FABER

Montag? Can you run? Can you try to
get away?
 

87.
EXT - MONTAG'S HOUSE - NIGHT

MONTAG
There's no running away from this.

CAPTAIN BEATTY
No.

IN THE CONTROL VAN

The Controllers are watching their monitors. Suddenly, FLASHING
LINES appear on screen, BEEPING, searching...

CONTROLLER #1
I've got a signal. Some kind of
bandwidth.

CONTROLLER #2
Source?

-+-and the crosshairs converge on Montag.

CONTROLLER #1
Son of a bitch is transmitting.

MONTAG AND BEATTY

MONTAG
How long have you known?

CAPTAIN BEATTY
From the start. Montag, you idiot.
Our Hound smelled the books on you.

He raises his plasma screen clipboard, punches in a playback
command, turns it so Montag can see. On it, a recording:

THE HOUND'S POV: We've seen this moment before -- Montag comes
around the firetruck the night he took the first two books,
freezing in his tracks as he encounters the beast.

CAPTAIN BEATTY
{enters new command)
So I checked the surveillance cams.
Lo and behold.

A new image pops up. From a hidden ceiling cam, we see Montag
pulling the first book out of the Scooper blade. Beatty freezes
the image, tracking it in for a TIGHT CLOSEUP.

CAPTAIN BEATTY
"Charlie the Choo Choo?" You threw
it all away -- your career, your
marriage, your life -- for goddamn
"Charlie the Choo Choo?"
 

88.

Controller #2 hurries up from the control van, pulls Beatty
aside, whispers in his ear. Beatty gives him a look.

CAPTAIN BEATTY
Really?

The man nods. Beatty sends him off, turns back to Montag.
There's a new look in Beatty's eye -- hungry, vengeful.

CAPTAIN BEATTY

I gave you every chance. Tried to
woo you, reason with you. I even
sent the Hound to sniff around your
house at night and throw a scare
into you. Even that didn't work...

(cocks his head)
-.-though it did get your neighbors
burned out and on the run. Yes, your
fault. All your fault.

(closing on him)
You dense...arrogant...traitorous...
ungrateful little bastard.

Beatty stuns Montag by hauling off and slapping him hard across
the ear (the one with the seashell in it). WHAP!

INT - FABER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

-- and the sound makes Faber jump, wrenching off his headset
as if he'd been slapped himself --

EXT - MONTAG'S HOUSE - NIGHT
CAPTAIN BEATTY
After all I did for you. After the
kindness I showed.

WHAP! Another slap across the same ear. Montag clutches the
side of his head in agony --

CAPTAIN BEATTY
I vouched for you. Put my professional
standing on the line for you. This
is how you repay me? And betray me?

WHAP! Beatty slaps him a third time -- only this time uses
his other hand. The blow rocks Montag's head, and:

The seashell flies from his ear, skittering onto the pavement .
IN THE CONTROL VAN
Controller #1 enters a command:

CONTROLLER #1
Jamming transmission now.
89.
BEATTY
strolls to the seashell, scoops it off the pavement.

CAPTAIN BEATTY

Your pal Faber?

(off Montag's shock)
Of course I know! I've been tracking
your every step! There are cameras
on every street corner of this city,
you moron! And Faber's been under
surveillance from the moment his
nephew went on the run!

(raises his clipboard)
We have you talking to him in the
park! Entering his building! Chatting
on the roof! Want to see? Or are
you willing to take my word for it?

MONTAG
Faber! Run!

CAPTAIN BEATTY
Go ahead, yell. He can't hear you.
We've jammed the transmission.
(closing in)
The next thing Mr. Faber knows, the
police will be kicking his door in.
WS Want to go over there, just to see
the look on his face? Oh, dear, I
almost forgot. You'll be in custody
yourself. For treason and sedition.
(stops before him)
If you're through making a fool of
yourself, you're under arrest.

Beat. Montag stands pinned in Beatty's gaze. And then:

CLICK. He works the safety catch on the flamethrower. The
flame billows up with a gentle hiss.

Beatty goes stiff, eyes widening slightly. And he smiles.

CAPTAIN BEATTY
Well, that's one way to get an
audience. Hold a gun on a man and
make him listen to your speech.
Well, speech away. What'll it be
this time? Why don't you belch
Shakespeare at me? "There is no
terror, Cassius, in your threats,
for I am armed so strong in honesty
that they pass me as an idle wind,
which I respect not!" How's that?
Go ahead, you trembling little prick.
Pull the trigger.

 
 

90.
Montag is trembling. Softly:

MONTAG
We never burned right.

CAPTAIN BEATTY
Hand it over, Montag. You're done.

Beat .

WHOOOOOOOOSH! An ERUPTION OF FIRE leaps out and hits Beatty
square in the chest, a searing fist of flame that grips him,
envelops him, drives him back, blows him off his feet.

Beatty sails through the air on a booster of fire, a blazing,
shrieking scarecrow. He lands on his back in a flaming heap,
arms flailing and legs drumming...and then goes still.

A hush falls. For an extended moment the scene is a tableau,
everybody frozen, faces slack with unspeakable shock.

IN THE CONTROL VAN _ t.,

They can't believe what they just saw on their screens.
AERIAL VIEW FROM HOVERCOPTER

Circling the scene below, monitors recording everything.

MONTAG

stands with the murder weapon in his hands, just as stunned
as everybody else. He's looking at his hands as if they'd
acted on their own volition, as if they weren't even his.

He looks up. Firemen are backing away, a few turn and run.

Montag knows there's no going back. Ever. He embraces his
moment of insanity, sets his feet --

MONTAG
RUUUUUN!

-- and begins to burn. WHOOOOOSH! Firemen scatter, running
clear as an ARC OF FLAME sweeps up and down the Salamander,
engulfing the firetruck, turning it into a blazing pyre.

Montag turns, swiveling the nozzle toward the control van...
++-and WHOOOOOOSH! FLAMES envelop the forward half of the
van. The controllers scatter from their posts and evacuate
out the back doors, running into the night as:

Montag circles around, BLASTING FIRE into the now empty van.
Monitor screens EXPLODE, spewing glass.
 

91.

He turns again, SCREAMING now, primal, stripped bare, hosing
the firetruck again, burning everything, burning all.

The flamethrowers lining the truck start EXPLODING on their
mounts, one after another, sending FIREBALLS into the sky.

The hovercopter veers off, fleeing the explosions.

BOOOOM! The fuel tank blows, lifting the Salamander into the
air and slamming it awesomely back down again, now a tangle
of shattered, flaming wreckage.

And then all is still. Montag stands, alone now, the street
around him in flames.

In a daze, he walks over to his murdered captain. The body's
still burning. Montag scans the pavement, finds:

The seashell. It's a bit scorched, but seems intact. He picks
it up, holds it to his ear with a shaky hand. He hears STATIC,
intermittent sound -- a voice?

MONTAG
Faber? Faber? Can you hear me?

The Mechanical Hound lunges from the flaming wreckage of the
firetruck, trailing fire as it streaks across the pavement.

WHAM! The beast hits Montag like a train, taking him off his
feet. He hits the pavement hard, the seashell goes flying.

The Hound starts savaging him, Montag bashing it with the
flamethrower nozzle, trying to drive it off.

The beast clamps down on his thigh and the hypo tongue shoots
out, jabbing hard into Montag's flesh. Montag SCREAMS as the
plunger depresses and the amber fluid starts to flow. But
only half the dose is emptied, because Montag rams the
flamethrower nozzle into the Hound's mouth and:

 

WHOOOOM! A BLAST OF FLAME erupts, driving the beast back,
blowing it off its feet. Flaming fluid spatters everywhere.

Montag's on fire, rolling across the pavement, trying to
smother the flames. He yanks the small extinguisher off his
arm and hoses himself with retardant, putting himself out.

 

He sits up, sees the flaming Hound coming for him again. He

lets the thing have it in the face with ANOTHER BLAST OF FIRE,
driving it back --

HOUND'S POV

-- and the flames damage the Hound's optics, its image of the
world jittering to snow as FLASHING WORDS appear: "Warning.
Optic Damage. Warning. Optic damage."
 

92.
MONTAG

watches the Hound spinning in circles, burning and blinded,
enraged, lashing out in all directions.

Montag rolls over, tries to get to his feet. He collapses,
SCREAMING, his leg useless from the dose of procaine.

He throws the quick-release buckles and shrugs the flamethrower
off. Trying again, he manages to get halfway to his feet,
hobbling across the pavement to the seashell. He scoops it

up, jams it in his ear, fleeing the scene.

MONTAG
Faber! Run! Get out! They'll be
there any minute!

INT - FABER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Faber's frantic, tweaking the signal, trying to hear.

Static. Montag crashes through a backyard, through the laundry
line, over a low fence. Dogs start BARKING. Lights come on.

CAMERA FOLLOWS as he keeps going, getting dopey, the procaine
hitting his brain. He's crossing an open field, some bushes
and trees. He shakes his head, trying to clear it...

...and stops, the world swimming before his eyes. He's seeing
double, triple. He crawls into some bushes and collapses there,
rolling onto his back, staring at the sky.

SIRENS are wailing somewhere. Hovercopter SEARCHLIGHTS probe
in the distance. Suddenly, the signal clears:

FABER'S VOICE
(filtered)
--ntag? Montag?

MONTAG
Yes? Yes? I hear you.

INTERCUT BETWEEN MONTAG'S AND FABER'S LOCATIONS:

Faber's in his overcoat, racing down the back stairs of his
building, careening from landing to landing:

FABER
I'm leaving. I'm getting out.

MONTAG
{processes that)
Good. That's good.

FABER
Are you okay? Can you tell me where
you are?

MONTAG

Um...not so good. Not so good right
now. Where? Um. No. Not really.

FABER
You don't know where you are? Are
you hurt? Can you walk?

Faber dashes out the back door and into the street, getting
lost among the pedestrians. He glances back. POLICE CARS are
pulling up at his building b.g. He missed them by moments.

FABER
Montag? Montag?

Montag's lying there, staring at the sky. He starts to laugh.

MONTAG
It's there. I see it.

FABER
What?

MONTAG

Clarisse said so. It's there. There
is a man in the moon...

(laughs)
+-.or. Could be drugs.

FABER
Montag! You have to think clearly!
Focus!
 

94.

MONTAG
Um, okay. Focusing. Right.

FABER
There's an abandoned district east
of downtown. Across the river from
the power plant. You know it?

MONTAG
Power plant? Yeah...

FABER
Across the river from the plant!
Old round building, 10th and Savoy!
If I can't come to you, kiddo, you
gotta come to me! C'mon, you can do
this! 10th and Savoy!

Montag sits up painfully, trying to clear his head.
MONTAG

Yeah, yeah, 10th and Savoy. Shut up
already.

Montag takes a final, longing look at the moon...and with
every ounce of willpower he's got, pushes to his feet...

EXT - CITY STREET - NIGHT

..-while Faber clicks off his transmitter, comes around the
corner -- and stops, gazing up in shock.

REVERSE ANGLE

reveals a GIANT STREET MONITOR on a building. On it, five
stories high, is the footage of Montag killing Beatty taken
from the hovercopter. CROWDS are gathering to watch as they
show the event again and again, along with all the lurid,
late-breaking details.

Faber looks around. Every monitor in the city's showing it.

CUT TO:
EXT - TRASH FIELD - NIGHT

Rubble everywhere, like the surface of the moon. The city
looms before us. Montag enters frame, limping toward it...

CUT TO:

EXT - FIELD - NIGHT

..-while far behind him, twigs are snapping. Something comes
through the bushes, emerges into the moonlight:
 

95.
The Hound. Scorched and semi-blind, eyes stuttering. It's
limping, gears and servos grinding with every step. But the

damn thing still works -- especially its nose. It sniffs the
spot where Montag was sprawled, presses on...

CUT TO:
EXT - CITY - ABANDONED DISTRICT - NIGHT

Deserted streets. Montag limps along a brick wall upon which
a long scrawl of graffiti is spray-painted.

He comes around a corner, gazes up. There, looming above us,

is the ROUND BUILDING at 10th and Savoy -- a ten-story cylinder
of brick, grimy as hell, ringed with windows and fire escapes,
hemmed in by other buildings just as ancient and decrepit.

INT - BUILDING - NIGHT

Montag enters through a broken doorway. The place is trashed.
Rats squeak and scurry. He works his way through darkness...

MONTAG
(softly)
Faber?
..-and_a DARK SHAPE lunges from the shadows.

It's a HOMELESS MAN -- huge, bearded, malevolent. He's got an
iron pipe in hands, poised to attack.

HUGE HOMELESS MAN
You the fireman?

Montag nods cautiously...
INT - MAIN ROTUNDA - NIGHT

..-.and is led into the rotunda. GROUPS OF HOMELESS are huddled
in the shadows around small cookfires, glaring suspiciously.

The huge homeless man taps him, directs his attention up.

CAMERA ANGLES UP to reveal that the interior of the building
is open all the way to the ceiling ten floors above -- each
floor is a round landing encircling the open shaft up the
middle. A face appears high above, peering down -- Faber.

FABER
Thank God.
 

 

96.
EXT - CITY STREET - NIGHT

The Hound sniffs along the same graffitied wall. It pauses at
the corner, looks up...

flashes and stutters...

CUT TO:
INT - POLICE COMMAND CENTER - NIGHT

..-While a BEEPING SIGNAL FLASHES on a screen over a SATELLITE
VIEW of the city. A POLICE DISPATCHER is intently monitoring
the signal as his CAPTAIN leans into frame.

DISPATCHER
Been tracking this for a few minutes
now.. Signal's faint. In and out.
It's Beatty's Hound.

POLICE CAPTAIN
Pinpoint it before you lose it. And
I mean to the square yard.

The dispatcher clicks the image down closer and closer...until
the round building is prominent in frame.

CUT TO:
INT - ROUND BUILDING - SEVENTH FLOOR LANDING - NIGHT

Faber helps Montag along the curved landing past long rows of
tall sheet-covered shelves, the smoke from the cookfires
drifting up from below. Montag's leaning on Faber, limping.

Faber pulls him into a dark cubby hole between shelves. The
area contains a cot, a few chairs, a sleeping bag, some tin
pots and pans are on a crate. Montag sits heavily on the floor.

FABER
You gonna make it?

MONTAG
My head feels clearer. Leg hurts
like hell.

FABER
But can you travel?
(off Montag's look)
I caught your act on the news. Me
and a few billion other people.
You're more wanted than Dillinger.
 

 

 

97.

Faber starts pulling clothes from an old foot locker, rooting
through them, tossing some to Montag.

FABER
Lose the uniform. These are old and
disgusting, but you'll be less
conspicuous.

MONTAG
(sniffs the clothes)
Where we going?

FABER
Far away as possible.
(off Montag's look)
There are some people, south of the
city, up in the mountains...

Montag painfully starts peeling his uniform off.

MONTAG
What kind of people?

FABER
People. The kind that ran out of
luck. Like us.

MONTAG
They live in the mountains?

FABER

Better than prison or re-education
camps. You'll like these folks,
they've got books. Lots of books.

(tosses more clothes)
In case we get separated, follow
the river out of the city. Always
stick to the river. Got that? C'mon,
get those clothes on...

EXT - ROUND BUILDING - NIGHT

AERIAL VIEW of the building, a beautiful establishing shot.
As OUR ANGLE SLOWLY DESCENDS...

---a PLITTER enters frame, dropping almost quietly from the
sky. Followed by another. And another. A string of flitters
descending toward the roof like drifting seed pods.

A flitter is a one-man flying exoskeleton with four ducted
turbofans, two above and two below -- picture a flying suit
open at the front that you step into. Each one is piloted by
a_ SWAT TROOPER, armored and helmeted, face invisible behind a
gleaming black visor. (Each flitter also has a pair of
automated GATLING GUNS mounted on the sides.)
 

98.

The flitters touch down one after another, gentle as kisses,
instantly taking off again as each trooper jumps clear.

The flitters now become pilotless drones that begin circling
the building, onboard systems going fully automatic, computers
and gyros humming. IMAGING SCANNERS activate, methodically
sweeping the building...

ON THE ROOF

+..as the troopers scurry across the roof, weapons at the
ready, moving with scary precision and hand signals. They
assemble, crouching in a circle formation, waiting...

ON THE GROUND

-.-aS8 SWAT APC VEHICLES encircle the building on the ground,
also sweeping with imaging scanners. TROOPS come pouring out
of the vehicles, down alleys, taking up positions...

INT - POLICE COMMAND CENTER - NIGHT
..as the SCANNER IMAGES come through on the monitors:

DISPATCHER
(on headset)
We have movement throughout the
building, mostly first floor, but
scattered throughout all levels. At
least four dozen unfriendlies by my
count. Check your handhelds...

EXT - BUILDING ROOFTOP - NIGHT

The troopers on the roof check their plasma palm-screens as a

schematic of the building appears. TINY GLOWING DOTS indicate
the people inside.

EXT - BUILDING - HIGH ABOVE AN ALLEY - NIGHT

A flitter is drifting sideways, tracking movement inside. As
it comes near, its onboard plasma screen shows TWO HUMAN
FIGURES IN HEAT REGISTER SHAPES moving along together...

INT - SEVENTH FLOOR LANDING - NIGHT

..-which are Montag and Faber hurrying down the long row of
sheet-covered shelves. Montag's new clothes are pretty shabby,
but at least the coat is warm.

MONTAG
What was this place?

. FABER
Believe it or not, it was a book
depository once. In fact...
 

 

99.

He indicates the covered shelves. With a look of disbelief,
Montag reaches up grabs a sheet, pulls it off. A whole row of
eight-foot high shelves are revealed, lined with books.

MONTAG
You're kidding.

PABER
Been trickling in here for decades.

Probably the biggest stash in North
America.

Montag continues down the line, stunned, pulling off more
sheets, revealing more books. He looks around, sees the various
levels lined with covered shelves. Books beyond counting.

 

FABER
Some people and I were trying to
work out a plan once to get 'em out
of the city. Never could figure out
how to move so many books, though,
not with all the surveillance. Then
I got arrested, and nothing ever
came of it. That was years ago. And
here they sit.

Faber glances over, sees a book, pulls it off the shelf -- a
paperback of "David Copperfield."

FABER
Oh, nice. Take this one. For the
trip. One of my favorites.

Montag slips the book into his pocket with a smile, pulls
down the next sheet, revealing:

The flitter is outside one of the huge windows just on the
other side of the shelves, hovering there, peering in. Montag's
stunned, frozen. Faber can't see from his angle:

FABER
What?

The gatling guns abruptly swivel up and lock into place.

Montag lunges, slamming into Faber as:

BRRRAAAAAAAAPPP! The window and the surrounding walls EXPLODE
inward in a hurricane of masonry and glass. Montag and Faber
hit the floor, the bookshelves above their heads vaporizing
in a cloud of paper and wood...

ON THE ROOF

---while the troopers, still in their circle formation, FIRE
BOLTS straight down into the tarpaper at their feet.
 

 

100.

They turn, running out to form a wider circle where they FIRE
different bolts into the roof -- unlike the first, these are
rappelling bolts. They quick-snap steel cables leading from
their chest harnesses, getting ready...

IN THE BUILDING

...as silence falls. Montag and Faber look up from the floor,
ears ringing, stunned. Montag crawls a few feet, peers around
what's left of the book shelf.

A huge section of exterior wall is gone. The flitter's out
there, scanning and hovering. Locking in.

Montag grabs Faber, pulls him to his feet, runs.

BRRRRAAAAAAAAAAPPP! BRRRRAAAAAAAAPPP! The flitter tracks them
sideways, the wall disintegrating to dust in the onslaught.

Montag and Faber run along the landing, books and shelving
exploding and vaporizing down the line behind them, churned
into clouds of confetti, erupting out over the railing, snowing
down to the floors below --

GROUND FLOOR

~- where doors EXPLODE off their hinges, people SCREAMING and
scattering as troopers swarm in, laser-sighted assault rifles
sweeping to and fro in the darkness. BURSTS OF GUNFIRE erupt --

SEVENTH FLOOR

-- as Montag and Faber dive to the floor. The flitter's gatling
guns sweep over their heads and past them, ripping on down
the row of bookshelves...

OUTSIDE

...and the flitter pauses, ceasing fire, coming back again to
scan for its target...

INSIDE
...as Montag and Faber hug the floor, thinking the flitter's

gone, deafened by the GUNFIRE ECHOING through the building
from below. A frozen moment as their eyes meet:

MONTAG
I'm sorry.

FABER
Don't. I haven't felt this good in
years.

(a harsh laugh)
I'm scared shitless.
 

 

101.

MONTAG
Come on! Let's find a way out!

They lunge to their feet, start to run, but:
SLOW MOTION

BRRRRAAAAAAAAAAPPPPPPP! The flitter's gunfire chews through
the bookshelves again, churning up a tornado of debris...

..-as Montag spins, grabbing Faber's hand...

..-and the gunfire hits Faber, blowing him off his feet,
knocking him sideways in a hazy red mist, ripping him out of
Montag's grasp, propelling him through the railing...

...as Montag spins, jerked off balance, also crashing through
the railing...

...and Faber sails out over the seven story drop inside the
building, floating now in a halo of debris...

..-.and Montag plummets, grabbing the collapsing railing as he
vaults out over the drop...

...and Faber falls away from us, drifting away like a dream,
down and down through the concentric circles of the landings
toward the ground floor far below...

RESUME SPEED

as Montag jerks to a stop, holding on to the shattered railing

above his head for dear life, legs kicking wildly above the
same sickening drop that Faber just took.

The railing is disintegrating in his grasp, lurching, tearing
loose. He looks down, sees the sixth floor landing below his
feet. He tries to swing himself in, kicking as his toes barely
scrape the edge of the railing below...

..-and the railing he's holding rips loose. Montag plummets --

but hooks the sixth floor railing with his arms as he
falls, slamming to a hard stop, SCREAMING as a few ribs break.

He holds on, dazed with shock and pain, trying to find the
strength to pull himself up and over, while:

ON THE ROOF

The troopers tuck their heads and detonate the inner circle
of bolts -- a RING OF SMALL EXPLOSIONS kicks up...

IN THE BUILDING

.--tearing loose a 20-foot diameter circle of the roof which
drops awesomely into the building, plummeting past Montag...
 

 

102.
ON THE ROOF

...and the troopers rush from their positions, jumping through
" the smoking hole...

IN THE BUILDING

+,-,and dropping down in a controlled freefall on their harness

rigs, laser sights sweeping the air.

Homeless people break cover on various landings, running for
their lives. The troopers OPEN FIRE as they plummet on their
cables, nailing evacuees on the run, shooting at anything
that moves.

Montag hauls himself up and over the railing onto the sixth
floor landing. He staggers to his feet and darts off behind
the bookshelves into the shadows as the troopers drop into
frame from above, their GUNFIRE chewing the area...

HANDHELD

Montag runs, a breathless plunge through madness, turning
this way and that, hearing yells and screams, barely avoiding
the troopers pounding up the stairs and sweeping the building,
FLASHES OF GUNFIRE stuttering and lighting up the shadows.

He comes to a window. His only way out. He grabs an old metal
chair, swings it, bashes out the window. CAMERA FOLLOWS HIM
out onto a fire escape six floors above the ground...

-.-and his nemesis the flitter descends into frame before
him, gatling guns swiveling up and locking into place.

Montag freezes, nowhere to go, knowing he's dead, and:
WHIIITITIRRRRR! The gatling guns spin, out of ammo.

Montag's stunned. Hearing VOICES behind him. A heartbeat of
decision, and:

He jumps from the landing, slams into the flitter, arms wrapped
around one of the lower turbofan ducts, hanging on for dear
life as the flitter bobs and spins, off balance, gyros
struggling as it goes twisting out of control, sailing across
the street toward the face of the building next door...

INT - BUILDING NEXT DOOR - NIGHT

-;-and CRASHING AWESOMELY in through a window, dragging Montag
with it, a storm of glass, Montag bouncing free as the machine
goes banging/cartwheeling off across the floor, plowing through
a wall and vanishing, gyros screaming as it keeps trying to fly.

 
 

 

103.

Montag rises, dazed and bleeding, looks out the demolished
window. Across the street in the round building, the battle
still rages, GUNFIRE FLASHING and echoing within.

He turns away, horrified. CAMERA FOLLOWS as he limps through
the shadows, looking for a way out...

EXT - ALLEY - NIGHT

...and bashes through a basement-level window. He crawls out,
hugging the shadows as a hovercopter SEARCHLIGHT sweeps by.
He can still hear sporadic gunfire from the block over.

Montag runs down the alley, vanishing into the night...

CUT TO:
INT - POLICE COMMAND CENTER - NIGHT

The dispatcher's listening on his headset as the reports come
in. He turns, causing shock in the room:

DISPATCHER
We lost him.

All eyes go to a MAN IN A SUIT in the shadows. This is no
cop, but a DHS OFFICIAL -- a man of scary power. He steps
forward. We don't see his face clearly, but the monitors in
the room are reflected in his glasses.

MAN IN SUIT
We're on a live feed. Half the world
is watching. No way do we "lose" him.
(checks his watch)
He dies in ten minutes. Do it.

EXT - CITY - NIGHT

More populated here, a Times Square feel. Montag limps along
in the flow of PEDESTRIANS, trying not to be noticed.

EXT - CITY - DIFFERENT AREA - NIGHT

SWAT APCs screech up, followed by a Fire Department CONTROL
VAN. MEN jump out, circle to the rear, open the doors. THREE
MECHANICAL HOUNDS bound out, racing off in a pack...

AERIAL VIEW

across the street below us.

PILOT'S VOICE
(heavily filtered)
Air Nine to Command. There go the
Hounds. Tracking now.
 

104.
The AERIAL VIEW TILTS, following the Hounds...
EXT - CITY STREET - NIGHT

...While Montag limps on. He sees a COP CAR cruising this
way, ducks into a crowd watching storefront VIDSCREENS:

ANNOUNCER
..-authorities now predicting a
swift conclusion to the manhunt.
Citizens are urged to get involved.
Watch for this man! Guy Montag!
Traitor! Cold-blooded murderer!

A PHOTO OF MONTAG pops up. RACK FOCUS to the real Montag in
the midst of the crowd. He moves uneasily among them, cap
pulled low, as the vid screens keep blaring:

ANNOUNCER
(touches his earpiece)
Going live now to Dow Phillips on
the scene...Dow, what's happening
there?

A REPORTER pops up, broadcasting live via minicam:
REPORTER
Steve, this was the scene just
moments ago at Civic Center...

Montag turns to see NEW FOOTAGE POP UP: the three Hounds
leaping from the van and racing off.

REPORTER
And they're off! Three Hounds --
count 'em, three! -- have been brought

in to deal with the situation! Now
that's unprecedented, but then so is
this crime, which has shaken this
city to its foundations...
Montag's heart goes into his throat. He keeps moving...

THE HOUNDS

race through the streets, ignoring traffic, scattering
pedestrians...

THE HOVERCOPTER
blasts over the city, turbofans SHRIEKING...

POV FROM AIR

+++a8 STREETCORNER VIDS give us the breathless play-by-play
over an AIR-TO-AIR SHOT of the police hovercopter...

ANNOUNCER (V.0O.)

--yes, our Eye In The Sky hovercam's
coming through very clearly. You can
see the police hovercopter there...and
the Hounds below...

...the VIDSCREEN IMAGE ANGLES DOWN, shaky, to the Hounds racing
along the street. Montag steps TIGHT INTO FRAME F.G. , tearing
his gaze from the vids and gazing up toward the sky.

ANNOUNCER
We're told they've changed direction
now. Heading west. Toward the river.

Montag's heart sinks. There are hovercopters all over the
city. Which one is pursuing him? He forces himself to wait
for the light to change, desperate not to attract attention
to himself, sweating bullets all the while.

PUNDIT
Steve, these Hounds are amazing
technology, with a sense of smell a
hundred thousand times keener than
a real dog's. This gives them instant
DNA recognition, which means they
can identify a human being simply
by smell...

The light changes. Montag crosses with the crowd...

THE HOUNDS

running, a blur of chrome, a thunder of rubber-padded paws...
MONTAG

walking faster now, jostling in a flow of pedestrians, hearing
SIRENS, tossing terrified looks behind him...

INT - POLICE COMMAND CENTER - NIGHT

All eyes on the monitors: an aerial view sweeping over the
streets below. Faces tense.

EXT - STREET CORNER - NIGHT

A CITY BUS is turning the corner, passing by us with its side
vidscreens blaring --

ANNOUNCER
---we'll be patching over any moment
now to Police Command, the nerve
center of the hunt, live as it
happens. I'm told we can even expect
a live feed from the police
hovercopter itself...

-- and it wipes from frame, revealing Montag hurrying toward
us. He pauses, looking up, hearing a hovercopter getting
closer. Still forcing himself not to run, he steps off the
curb, moving out across a wide empty boulevard alone...

INT - POLICE COMMAND CENTER - NIGHT
++-as the AERIAL VIEW on the monitor screen shows:

A FIGURE crossing a wide empty boulevard below us. Caught in

Montag spinning around, panicking, trying to see where his

INT - POLICE COMMAND CENTER - NIGHT

Everybody riveted to the screens as:

MAN IN SUIT
I want some nice close shots. I
want to see his face.

DISPATCHER
I need those overlays now!

WHIP PAN TO another console, where a TECH is generating DIGITAL
3D SCANS of Montag's face -- side view, front view.

EXT - CITY STREET - NIGHT

A MAN is crossing a wide empty boulevard alone -- not Montag.
Some homeless guy with a pint bottle in a paper bag. He keeps
turning around, looking up, more and more nervous about the
hovercopter up there. Is it following him?

Suddenly, the SEARCHLIGHT stabs down, pinning him in a halo
of glare. He stands frozen, stunned, shielding his eyes...

INT - POLICE COMMAND CENTER - NIGHT

taking a few nervous steps back. FLASHING COMPUTER LINES
converge on his face, locking in...

DISPATCHER
Switching to overlay now.

---and the man's face is replaced with a perfectly animated
DIGITAL OVERLAY of Montag's face...

POLICE CAPTAIN
Going live?

MAN IN SUIT
Wait. Put a gun in his hand.

The tech enters a fast command. FLASHING LINES converge again,
putting a digital pistol in the fake Montag's hand.

MAN IN SUIT
Now. Go live.

ANNOUNCER

WHIP PAN TO A STUDIO MONITOR as the live aerial image pops

spinning dizzily around him...

We're live! There he is, there's

EXT - CITY STREET - NIGHT

..while the homeless man also runs, panicking now as the

Suddenly, the Hounds veer into view, streaking toward him.

He cuts and runs in another direction, sheer panic now, the
beasts pursuing him up the street.

ANNOUNCER (V.0O.)
He's running! He's got a gun!

The Swat APC screeches into view up ahead, cutting him off,
the troopers in the turrets aiming assault rifles...

EXT - CITY STREET - NIGHT

ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
He's hemmed in! There's nowhere he
can go!
-.-and he limps TIGHT TO CAMERA, gazing up.
CAMERA COMES AROUND TO REVEAL a vidscreen on the side of a

face is running. Screaming. The Hounds are catching up...
EXT - CITY STREET - NIGHT
MAN
I AIN'T DONE NOTHIN'! I AIN'T DONE

flurry of titanium teeth, savaging him, dragging the body...

MAN IN SUIT
Ah. Happy ending.
 

109.
EXT - CITY STREET - NIGHT

As Montag watches, the image goes to a LIVE HANDHELD SHOT of
the Swat team running in with rifles poised, surrounding the
body, the Hounds now backing off...

ANNOUNCER

Montag is down. You can see the
troopers converging. We're awaiting
word.

(pauses, listening)
Ladies and gentlemen, Guy Montag is
dead. A vicious criminal has been
brought to justice. A grave crime
against society has been avenged.
And you saw it here...live.

MONTAG

stares at the vid, stunned. He turns away, sickened, looks
across an empty plaza at:

The river. The stone retaining walls are right there. All he
has to do is walk to it.

He starts across the plaza, limping and exhausted.

As he nears the river, it's dawning on him that he's free.
He's done it. He's going to make it out of the city.

And then something makes him stop. A sound? An instinct? He
turns. Slowly. There, across the plaza:

Beatty's Hound. Scorched chrome and gleaming teeth. still
tracking him. Eyes dilating. Stuttering. Locking in...
HOUND POV

-+.as Montag stands frozen...the image flashing and
stuttering...flashing and stuttering...

THE PLAZA
Montag cuts and runs, making for the river wall.

The Hound launches itself across the pavement to intercept,
gears grinding but fast as hell.

Montag gets to the wall, no time to jump, grabs up a pipe and
spins to defend himself as the beast leaps --

WHAM! Montag nails the Hound with a terrific blow, sends it
tumbling. The beast lands on its feet, paws scrabbling for
traction, lunging again. Montag drives it back with a desperate
flurry of blows, hitting it again and again --
 

 

110.

MONTAG
LET ME GO! GODDAMN YOU!

-- and the Hound snatches the pipe from Montag's grasp,
crushing it with his jaws, metal grinding, whipping its head
and hurling it clattering away across the ground.

Montag tries for the wall. The Hound leaps, hits Montag. They
both go over, momentum carrying them into freefall...

They fall endlessly, Montag holding the beast by the throat,
keeping its teeth at bay. SPLASH! They hit the river --

UNDERWATER

-- and sink into the dark waters, still locked in combat. The
Hound is inches from Montag's nose, snarling and snapping,
trying to take his face off...

.--but Montag wrenches free. The Hound lashes in utter demonic
fury, for there's one thing Hounds can't do -- float.

It sinks away beneath Montag's feet, vanishing into the dark
brackish depths, jaws still snapping...

EXT - RIVER SURFACE - NIGHT

-.-and Montag breaks the surface, gasping in great lungfuls
of air. It's all he can do to keep from drowning as the swift
current carries him away into the night...

DISSOLVE TO:
A SERIES OF SHOTS

leaves the city behind and takes us further and further along
the river into the wilderness... .

...with Montag clutching a gnarled old log like a shipwreck
survivor, too weak to do anything but hold on, the current
carrying him along under the stars...

+.-ever toward the mountains, where a faint smudge of rosy
glow promises a coming dawn...

DISSOLVE TO:
EXT - RIVERBANK - PRE-DAWN
Montag and his log are swept gently into a tangle of other
debris, coming to a stop. He's unconscious and shivering, his

hands like white claws holding the log in a death grip.

We're looking at a man at the end of his last frayed rope.
This would be, literally, his last gasp. Except:

 
 

 

111.

FIGURES ENTER FRAME. Rough-hewn. We won't yet see their faces.
They gather at water's edge, peering down at Montag. Two of
the men wade into the water, pulling the log closer, prying
him free, handing him up toward the others.

Montag is dragged onto the riverbank, though he's not even
aware it's happening. He's out of it, shaking with hypothermia
and fever...

CUT TO:
EXT - WILDERNESS - DAWN

..-and now he's wrapped in skins, being dragged along on a
rough wooden litter, head whipping with feverish dreams...

FLASHCUT INSERT

..-where a nightmare Hound lunges into camera, a blur of teeth
and eyes and procaine tongue...

MONTAG

-.-and Montag CRIES OUT, flailing at phantoms as they drag
him further and further into the mountains...

FADE TO:
INT - TENT - LATE DAY

Very quiet here. CAMERA PANS a spill of waning sunlight across
the floor, coming to:

Montag. He's wrapped in bedding up to his chin. A cool damp
cloth on his forehead.

His eyes flutter open, trying to focus. He's coming back to
us. As coherency returns, he looks around...

-..and sees a LARGE MAN hunkered across the tent, staring at
him with piercing eyes and a wild tangle of beard. His name
is GRANGER. He looks like he's been squatting there for hours.

GRANGER
So. You live. You've been out all
day, I was beginning to wonder.

Montag tries to speak, but can't manage it just yet. Granger
glances to a LITTLE BOY.

GRANGER
Go on, get the others.

The boy scampers from the tent. Montag becomes aware of a no-
nonsense elderly woman, MAGGIE, as she leans over and gives
him a sip of water.
 

112.

MONTAG
Thank you.

PEOPLE start entering, finding places, hunkering down. Montag
finds faces staring at him, not all of them friendly -- WILSON,
SYKES, MORALES, PEMBERTON, ROYCE. Whispers are exchanged, as:

MORALES
Maggie?

MAGGIE
Hypothermia almost did him in. And
being in that filthy river all night
with all these cuts...I had to pump
him full of antibiotics.

SYKES
As if we had plenty to spare. We
should have left him where he was.

WILSON
Murdered him, you mean?

SYKES
Just let the river have him. That
would have been enough.

WILSON
Amounts to the same thing.

GRANGER -
That's not the way we do things.
Not who we are. You know that.

SYKES
What I don't know is that we can
trust him.

PEMBERTON
That broadcast. The manhunt. Could
have been faked. A ploy.

SYKES
He could be a plant. They might be
looking to crack down on us. Of
course they'd have to find us first.
What better way?

GRANGER
So you do think we should kill him.

Granger unsheathes a bowie knife, passes it to Sykes.
GRANGER

Go on. You feel most strongly about
it. He's all yours.
 

 

113.

Sykes holds the knife awkwardly, meets Montag's gaze. Montag
glances to Granger, notes his twinkle of amusement as:

GRANGER
Go on, hell. I'm hungry. Dinner's
waiting.

SYKES

Dammit. You know that's not what I
mean. We can just leave him behind.

VOICE (0.S.)
No, I say do it. Kill him.

Montag looks up as another man enters the tent. Recognition
dawns in Montag's face as CAMERA COMES AROUND to reveal:

DILLMAN
Son of a bitch owes me money. I bet
he didn't bring it.

MONTAG
Dillman? Diliman?

Dillman comes over, crouches down. Takes Montag's hand.

MONTAG
You're alive.

DILLMAN :
More than I can say for you. Caught -
your act on the late show. Good
reception up here on the handhelds.
Wow, some climax. Three Hounds and
everything. Great special effects.

(leans in)

You could'a just left town like I
did.

MONTAG
You could've invited me.

They share a smile. Beat. Dillman turns to the others.

DILLMAN
I know this man. He's a good man.
Whatever you do to him, you do to
me. If he's left behind, I'll be
with him. That's the way it is.

PEMBERTON
Your loyalty is admirable. But.
(glances to Granger)
Is it enough?

The question lingers in the air. And then:
 

114.

GIRL'S VOICE (0.S.)
He gave me a book once.

All eyes go to the tent flap. Clarisse hovers there, peering
in, shy but self-determined. Montag is quietly overcome with
emotion at the sight of her. She meets his eyes and smiles.

CLARISSE
That's Mr. Montag. He used to be a
fireman.

Looks are traded in heavy silence...
EXT - CAMP - MAGIC HOUR

-..and Montag is brought from the tent, Clarisse and Dillman
at his side. There are tents, pack mules, campfires. PEOPLE
are going about their business, a nomadic tribe of sixty or
more. Montag draws his share of stares and curious looks.

Montag pauses, seeing a man before him. The face is familiar,
it him takes a moment to realize -- it's Clarisse's father.
They stare at each other for a long moment. Softly:

MONTAG
I met your uncle. He saved my life.
I liked him very much.

FATHER
Me too.

Beat. Clarisse's father offers his hand. They shake.
EXT - CAMP - MAGIC HOUR

Various groups are eating around the campfires. We find Montag
with Granger and the others:

GRANGER
We're breaking camp after dinner.
Heading further up into the
mountains. Always better to travel
at night. Are you up to it?

MONTAG
I'll keep up.

GRANGER
Winter's coming on. We'll hook up
with a few other groups like ours.
We know some abandoned mineshafts,
some of 'em go pretty deep. They're
not comfortable, but they keep us
alive when the snow falls. We'll
spend the winter there, hibernating
like bears.
 

 

A few groans.

115.

MONTAG
And catching up on your reading?
(off their looks)
Faber said you had books. A lot of
books. Is that where they are, up
in the mines?

ROYCE
Did he say mines? Or minds? Oh dear,
a pun.

Montag looks around at their faces, confused.

MONTAG
I'm...sorry. I don't understand.

GRANGER
We have books. Yes, you could say
that. But not the kind you think.
We hid them away where nobody could
ever find them. Or burn them.
(looks around)
Go on. Introduce yourselves.

Morales leans forward, speaking to Montag:

MORALES
There was a desert wind blowing
that night. It was one of those
dry, hot Santa Anas that come down
through the mountain passes and
curl your hair and make your nerves
jump and your skin itch. On nights
like that every booze party ends in
a fight. Meek little wives feel the
edge of the carving knife and study
their husbands' necks. Anything can
happen. You can even get a full
glass of beer at a cocktail lounge.
(extends his hand)

Raymond Chandler. The Simple Art of
Murder. Pleased to meet you.

Montag shakes his hand, still confused, as another man speaks:

ROYCE
No one would have believed, in the
last years of the nineteenth century,
that human affairs were being watched
keenly and closely by intelligences
greater than man's and yet as mortal
as his own...

And now other voices join in, coming from all around him, the
words mingling and overlapping:
 

PEMBERTON
Listen. Billy Pilgrim has come
unstuck in time. Billy has gone to
sleep a senile widower and awakened
on his wedding day. He has walked
through a door in 1955 and come out
another one in 1941...

WILSON
...the man in black fled across the
desert, and the gunslinger followed.
The desert was the apotheosis of
all deserts...

MATHESON
...on those cloudy days, Robert
Neville was never sure when sunset
came, and sometimes they were in
the streets before he could get
back...

MAGGIE
...the seller of lightning rods
arrived just ahead of the storm. He
came along the street of Green Town,
Illinois, in the late cloudy October
day, sneaking glances over his
shoulder...

SYKES
...there was me, that is Alex, and
my three droogs, that is Pete,
Georgie, and Dim, Dim being really

dim, and we sat in the Korova Milkbar

making up our rassoodocks what to
do with the evening...

116.

Montag's looking around, nonplussed. He glances to Dillman,

who starts laughing at the look on his face.

. DILLMAN
Say hello to the books.

GRANGER
Don't judge us by our covers.
(taps his head)
Each one of us. A book. With the
pages locked away where they can
never be burned.
(leans over, clasps
Montag's hand)
I answer to the name I was given,
Harold Granger. But I have a secret
name. Walter Miller, A Canticle for
Liebowitz, published 1959. We have
(MORE)
 

 

117.

GRANGER (CONT'D)
many secret names here. Look around.
There's H.G. Wells. Mary Shelley.
Jonathan Swift. Lincoln. Shaw.
Darwin. Also Matthew, Mark, Luke
and John.

(beat)

Tell me, fireman. What's your secret
name going to be?

MAGGIE
He had this on him. Still damp, but
itll dry...

She tosses the paperback of "David Copperfield" to Granger.

GRANGER
Ah. David Copperfield. Dickens.
Good one. But thick. You'll have
your work cut out for you.

Granger tosses the book. Montag catches it. Off his look, we
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT - MOUNTAIN SLOPE - NIGHT

The tribe comes slowly up the slope of a mountain pass by the
light of a full moon, ragged knots of people and pack animals.

Thirty miles behind them is the city, spread out below in an
ocean of lights.

MONTAG (0.S.)
"Chapter one. I am born. Whether I
shall turn out to be the hero of my
own life, or whether that station
will be held by anybody else, these
pages must show..."

Montag appears, coming toward us, the paperback in his hands.
He's got a penlight on it, speaking the words aloud:

MONTAG

"To begin my life with the beginning
of my life, I record that I was
born, as I have been informed and
believe, on a Friday, at twelve
o'clock at night. It was remarked
that the clock began to strike, and
I began to cry, simultaneously..."

His voice trails off. A SOUND has been building, unnoticed at
first, but now loud enough to make him stop and look up.

People all along the slope are also pausing, also gazing up.
 

 

118.

A SHRIEKING SOUND is tearing the sky, turning the world hushed
and eerie.

Montag sees glowing VAPOR TRAILS forming in the stratosphere
high above, lit by the moon.

Streaking overhead. Toward the city.

And then, from a great distance, a WAILING SOUND drifts from
the city, rising and falling. CIVIL DEFENSE SIRENS.

INT - HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Millie's in bed, watching TV, half dozing. She rises, hearing
the SIRENS. She's drawn toward the window, wondering what on
earth that sound is...

EXT - MOUNTAIN SLOPE - NIGHT

Montag sees one of the vapor trails break out of formation,
separating from the others and descending now in gentle arc
toward the city, drifting as silently as thistledown.

A PINPOINT OF LIGHT begins to glow brighter and brighter at
the head of the falling vapor trail, glimmering and halating,
almost like an angel being born.

Montag and the others watch in wonder, still not making sense
of what they're seeing...

INT - HOTEL - NIGHT

Millie comes to the window, gazing out at the city. A BRILLIANT
GLOW builds from the sky, descending to earth. She looks up,
her face becoming childlike, enchanted...

EXT - MOUNTAIN SLOPE - NIGHT

-..and Montag suddenly realizes:

MONTAG
(softly) .

Oh my God...
GRANGER

(also realizing)
DON'T LOOK AT THE LIGHT! DON'T LOOK
AT THE L--

Light. Flashing into existence over the city like a silent
sun, or the bang at the beginning of creation, stunning and
beyond comprehension. The world turns white before us like a
million flashbulbs going off at once, turning the people and
animals on the mountain slope into silhouettes, mules bucking,
men and women falling and throwing themselves to the ground.
 

119.

Granger is caught looking at the detonation, screaming and
clapping his hand over his eyes...

THE CITY - EXTREME SLOW MOTION

++-as a wave of holy white fire sweeps through the canyons of
concrete and steel, shattering buildings like crystal vases,
taking bridges off their moorings, turning the river to steam,
toppling towers, ripping trains off their tracks, melting
glass and beam and rivet to slag...

INT - HOTEL - NIGHT (SLO-MO)

..-and Millie never has time to scream as the glare blows
through the window and sends her sailing on a wind of white
fire, the walls collapsing and taking flight, a flaming bedside
lamp hurtling through frame...

EXT - MOUNTAIN SLOPE - NIGHT

..-and Montag pulls his face off the ground as the initial
glare subsides enough to see, staring in horror, the ROAR of
the detonation now rolling across the mountains like a thousand
claps of endless thunder...

MONTAG
(a whisper)
Millie.

THE CITY - EXTREME SLOW MOTION

+.-and the fire expands ever onward, pushing before it a tidal
wave of perfect pristine technology now reduced to flaming
debris in the roaring heart of a nuclear furnace, all the
great works of humankind now undone...

EXT - MOUNTAIN SLOPE - NIGHT
+.-and Montag gets to his feet, staring in awe.

A HUGE MUSHROOM CLOUD is erupting from the glare, rising into
the sky.

People around him are huddled, sobbing, disoriented. A few
others also get to their feet, watching.

The shockwave of wind arrives, turning the mountain slope
into a momentary hurricane, trees whipping in a frenzy,
knocking some people back off their feet. Montag covers his
face with his hands, protecting his eyes. As the wind begins
to dissipate, he hears:

DILLMAN (0.S.)
Montag! Montag!
 

 

120.

Montag looks down the slope. There, far below, stands Dillman.
His arms are spread wide, his face turned toward the mushroom
cloud, his teeth bared in a grimace of what may be either
sheer terror or joyous exultation. Let's face it -- in this
moment, Dillman's gone just a little bit insane:

DILLMAN
(bellowing)
HISTORY BEGINS WITH US!

Montag turns, sees people shaking and crying, dazed with shock.
Pemberton's running by, wild-eyed and incoherent. Montag grabs
him, spins him around. One lens of the man's eyeglasses is
cracked down the center.

MONTAG
Which way are the winds blowing?

PEMBERTON
Wind? What? I...I don't...what?

GRANGER
West. Prevailing winds are west.
The fallout will blow away from us.

 

Montag sees Granger on the ground, hands shaking before his
sightless eyes. He lets Pemberton go, comes over.

MONTAG
Granger?

GRANGER
I'm blind, fireman. I saw the light.

Montag crouches, offers his hand, gentle:

MONTAG
I'll lead you.

Granger takes Montag's hand, squeezes it. His other hand finds
Montag's face, fingers seeking.

GRANGER
Lead? Yes, why not? The fireman
will lead.

SYKES

Lead? Lead where? What are you
talking about?

Others are gathering. Clarisse appears, helping Montag get
Granger to his feet.

MONTAG
The mines. You said they were deep.
 

 

121.

GRANGER
Pray they are. It's going to be a
long winter. Longer than we thought.

Montag glances around. A lot of faces are suddenly looking to
him, seeking answers or reassurance. Their fear and uncertainty
surround him.

MONTAG
You heard him! Gather your things!
Help the injured! Grieve later!
We've got a long way to go! Move!

They do. People up and down the slope prepare to move on,
gathering their things, helping the injured.

Montag glances to Clarisse. She's clutching Granger's arn,
ready to help guide him.

MONTAG

turns, taking one last look at his city, a hot wind still
rippling his clothes.

THE MUSHROOM CLOUD is rising higher and higher, godlike above

the fading glare, a roiling pillar of fire bellowing into the
heavens.

DISTANT FLASHES begin appearing here and there on the horizon.
More nuclear explosions, but much too far away to see.

AS CAMERA CLOSES IN on Montag, we hear him speaking his most
quiet and precious thoughts for the final time...

MONTAG'S VOICE (V.0.)
Fire is bright. Fire is clean. Fire
sweeps away the clutter of the
past...and provides a bright and
shining future.

...and as we END ON A FINAL TIGHT CLOSEUP, we see tiny
pinpoints of nuclear fire reflected in his eyes...

MONTAG'S VOICE (V.0.)
It is good to burn. This is what I
have been taught. This is what I
know.

(beat)

It is all I need to know.

FADE OUT
