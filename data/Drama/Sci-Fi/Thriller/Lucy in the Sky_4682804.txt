AN ASTRONAUT

slowly floats into shot, an arm reaching for something we
can’t see.

CLOSE UP ON A WHITE GLOVE

fingers outstretched. On the far side of screen the edge of
something flat, grey and man-made appears.

A WIDE REVERSE

On the astronaut framed against a GIANT MOON. The astronaut
closes on the INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION. The SPACE SHUTTLE
DISCOVERY is docked below.

A razor sharp shadow line dropped by the shuttle wing moves
across the grey painted aluminium surface towards the
astronaut.

GLOVE FINGERS close around the yellow grab rail on the
DISCOVERY.

LAURA
Contact.

MALE VOICE
We copy. Heart rate 72.

LAURA
In the foot restraints.

MALE VOICE
That’s good work up there, Laura.

WE FIND A WOMAN'S FACE

This is Mission Specialist LAURA WALLACE (40). It is her
first space walk, her first NASA mission, but if she’s
nervous or intimidated she doesn’t show it. Laura was the
girl in Junior High who finished calculus tests early, so she
could go run two miles before track practice.

To her, life is a series of tasks and she is the tool God
made to get them done.

In the distance, the SUN rises for the sixth time today,
golden light moving across the shuttle.

THE SCREEN FILLS WITH WHITE LIGHT.
LAURA
Damn, that’s bright.

OUT OF TOTAL WHITE-OUT bleached facial features appear.

HANK (0.S.)
You OK?

LAURA
That's so bright.

She blinks as white light moves across her face in a sharp
line.

LAURA (CONT'D)
Sun-bounce off the panel. I’m OK.
Ready to swing out.

We PULL OUT to find that she has attached herself to the
CANADARM of the Space Shuttle Discovery -- a long, folded
robotic arm designed to help astronauts do difficult work.

HANK (0.S.)
Swing out in five, four, three,
two, one.

The arm begins a SLOW SWING wide, extending to its full one
hundred feet, then angles in towards the ISS.

CHITHRA (0.S.)
Panel 4 on its way to you now.

LAURA
Roger that.

ANGLE ON THE EARTH
below her, a swirling mass of oceans and continents.

HANK
Attach t-line.

LAURA
Safety tether attached.

CLOSE ON LAURA

focused on the job, her face framed inside her helmet. The
suit she’s wearing weighs 250 pounds, but in zero gravity she
can’t feel the weight. Outside the temperature is -100
celcius in the shade, but in direct sun the shuttle can heat
to 260 degrees.
oe

There is no oxygen in space, just a cold vacuum that would
boil your body fluids and asphyxiate your brain in minutes if
you didn’t have the suit, which Laura does -- allowing her to
float there waiting as the replacement panel is lifted to her
by a long robotic arm.

She watches it come, focused on the job, no time to sight-
see.

BELOW HER
A wall of airborne sand pushes across the Atlantic from the
Sahara, as a perfect spiral of Hurricane Daniel off Mexico's
Pacific coast throws mile long arcs of lightning from cloud
to cloud.

CUT TO:
INT. AIR LOCK. INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION - “DAY”

Laura comes in through the air hatch. PRIYA CHITHRA (30s) and
Mission Commander HANK LYNCH (40s) help her out of her suit.

HANK
Not bad, huh?

LAURA
What?

Beat. Is she serious?
HANK

Wallace, you just spent seven hours
in space, surrounded by God's
celestial beauty. Tell me you
looked around.

ANGLE ON LAURA

She didn’t.

LAURA
Next time.

CUT TO:
INT. CREW QUARTERS. INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION - “NIGHT”
Laura and the crew sleep strapped into insulation bags
attached to the shuttle walls. In micro G, the unconscious

astronauts seem frozen -- arms bent, hair stood out on end.

We FIND LAURA, at peace, dreaming zero G dreams. We HEAR a
MAN's voice.
DREW (0.S.)
That’s right, honey. Mommy’s up in
space right now.

We hear a little boy's voice.

NEIL (0.S.)
Why?

DREW (0.S.)
Well, she’s -- you remember mommy
showed you -- how there’s a
building in space -- a station --
and the people in it, they need
food and water. And somebody to fix
the fridge when it breaks. So we
send astronauts to fly up there and
do a job.

NEIL (0.S.)
And mommy’s an astronaut.

CLOSE ON LAURA
Her eyelids moving as she dreams.

DREW (0.S.)
That’s right. It’s all she ever
wanted to be, and she did it. Yay,
mommy!

A long beat and then we hear a LOW TONE and the song HERE
COMES THE SUN by the BEATLES fills the cabin. The lights come
up gently. The crew stirs, moving slowly. All except Laura
who's EYES SNAP OPEN at the tone. She springs into action.

CUT TO:
INT. INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION - “NIGHT”

The CREW eats, dressed in branded fleece, getting used to
zero gravity.

HANK
So today is EVA two. We’1l be
offloading the MPLM. Chithra and
Henckle are on the arm. I’m on
point with Wallace and Cole.

ANGLE ON LAURA

She eats efficiently, rolling each tube from the bottom,
folding her foil packets.
Bo

A German Astronaut, MILES HENCKLE (30s) is sitting next to
her. He is looking at a PHOTOGRAPH. In it we see a WOMAN
posing with a BABY. He shows her.

MILES
Eleven months. My wife says
yesterday he points up, says daddy.
You have three, ya?

LAURA
A girl and two boys, twins.
MILES
You must miss them.
LAURA
It’s only a few days. And -- you
know -- they’re here with me.

She points to her head.

LAURA (CONT'D)
Their voices. Get it done, mom.
Make us proud.

Over the PA we hear:

MISSION CONTROL (0.S.)
Morning Discovery this is Houston
control.

Laura stands, chit chat over.

LAURA
Go time.

MISSION CONTROL (0.S.)
Laura that song was from your
family who hope you have a
wonderful space day today.

She tags the intercom.

LAURA
Roger, Houston CMS. Standby.

MISSION CONTROL (0.S.)
Discovery crew messages are on
board and printing. If you can work
it in, we’d like to get post sleep
cryo config performed in the next
15 minutes or so.
LAURA
Roger Houston. Starting sequence.
Calling 02 first. Hydrogen second.
Laura navigates a dizzying array of panels and switches.
LAURA (CONT'D)

CUT TO:
INT. MAIN HATCH - “DAY”

Laura stands in her space suit with Hank and COLE. Hank
reaches for the airlock control.

He pushes the button. The hatch opens.
ANGLE ON THE PLANET EARTH

As it is revealed by the retreating door, oceanic, bathed in
brilliance.

ANGLE ON LAURA
As celestial light hits her. The view is indescribable.
Despite her professional demeanor, Laura can’t help but take
in the magesty of the universe.

CUT TO:
EXT. SPACE SHUTTLE DISCOVERY - “NIGHT”
Laura, Hank and Cole put finishing touches on the panel she’s
repairing. It’s dark now, the sun hidden on the other side of

the Earth.

Below her, the NEON LIGHTS of the Shanghai night GLOW and
PULSE, reflecting off her visor.

HANK
Okay. Last bolt.

He fastens it.
HANK (CONT'D)

That's it, folks. Time to pack up
and go home.
7.
The three astronauts process that, the end of the mission.
Beat.

HANK (CONT'D)
Maybe five more minutes.

ANGLE ON LAURA

That's fine with her. She doesn’t want this trip to end.
CUT TO:

INT. COCKPIT. SPACE SHUTTLE DISCOVERY - DAY

The crew is strapped in for the return to Earth.

HENCKLE
ISS Decouple complete.

HANK
I have the stick. Beginning
descent.
He fires thrusters and begins their break from orbit. We PUSH
PAST the PILOT and CO-PILOT and move towards Laura, sitting
in back. Her job is done. Around her, the crew is talking,
laughing.

Laura stays focused, a tool without a task. She tries to hang
on to the feeling, to remember every moment, to slow time.

CUT TO:
EXT. EXOSPHERE - DAY

As the SHUTTLE descends from outer space, encounters
atmospheric resistance, it’s tiles beginning to heat up.

CUT TO:
EXT. STRATOSPHERE - DAY

Blue skies, just high enough to see the curvature of the
Earth.

BOOM BOOM.

The distinct double-thunderclap of the sonic boom that
accompanies every Space Shuttle as it re-enters earth’s
atmosphere, racing through the sky at 6,000 miles per hour.

BOOM BOOM.
The loud rumble of the Discovery crew out-running sound
itself can be heard all across the Gulf Coast.

The belly of Discovery glows BRIGHT LAVA-ORANGE.
CUT TO:
INT. SPACE SHUTTLE DISCOVERY - CONTINUOUS

COMMANDER LYNCH, steady hands at the controls, eases the
orbiter into its descent to the Eastern coast of Florida.

Laura, focused, attentive, monitors the onboard safety
systems. The noise is deafening but the crew hammers on.

HANK
There she is.

Through the windshield we see CAPE CANAVERAL, Runway 33
straight ahead.

HANK (CONT'D)
Gear down.

They make their approach to Cape -- the ground closing in
fast -- and TOUCH DOWN on the hard macadam like clockwork.

HANK (CONT'D)
Chutes.

A button is pushed.

PARACHUTES rocket from the rear of the orbiter. The
astronauts are thrown forward against their restraints, as
the G force of the fast brake kicks in.

Discovery rolls to a stop.

HANK (CONT'D)
Well done, astronauts.

They unbuckle.

HANK (CONT'D)
Let’s go home.

Laura removes her restraints, rising slowly. We notice all
the astronauts move sluggishly, feeling the effects of
gravity for the first time in two weeks.

CHITHRA
Ugh. Earth sucks.
Qo

They move out of the cockpit, into the MAIN HOLD and towards
the exterior door. Hank claps Cole on the shoulder, grinning.

Ahead of us, the SHUTTLE DOOR is opened, sunlight pouring in.
The cabin around Laura goes dark.

From her POV we approach the doorway -- the darkness around
the doorway closing our frame from 2:35 to 4:3. Laura enters
frame and --

EXITS THE SHUTTLE onto the --

EXT. RUNWAY 33. CAPE CANAVERAL - DAY

Now in full daylight, we realize we’re still in the shrunken
aspect ratio -- as if back on Earth Laura’s life is smaller
somehow, more claustrophobic.

ANGLE ON LAURA

as she blinks against the sunlight.

ANGLE ON THE RUNWAY

A LARGE CROWD is gathered on bleachers, NASA personnel,
families and the general public.

HANK waves to the crowd, as do the other astronauts. They are
celebrities for a day, American heroes.

ANGLE ON THE CROWD

We see DREW WALLACE (40s) and the kids. Drew is a NASA public
relations executive. He’s a handsome guy with a good smile,
who worships his wife.

DREW
(points)
There she is. There’s mommy.

CLOSE UP ON LAURA

She looks a little stunned at the change of focus -- from
mission to celebration. An hour ago she was on the
International Space Station, hundreds of miles above the
Earth.

She works up a smile, waves.

NASA boiler suited WORKERS approach and help the crew to a
flag draped stage. Hank takes an offered MICROPHONE.

HANK
Thank you, Cape Canaveral!
10.

Thunderous applause. The crew can’t help but smile.

HANK (CONT'D)

This bird was in the best shape of
any I’ve flown. We did it. We’1l do
it again. Darn it, we’re gonna be
doing it for a heck of a long time.

The crowd goes nuts. Laura deals with gravity, squints.

HANK (CONT'D)

Also -- to the crew and family of
the Columbia -- we miss you every
day -- let’s have a moment of
silence.

Everyone on the stage and in the crowd goes silent, bows
their heads. A long beat as we see the faces in the crowd,

including Laura’s family.

HANK looks up.

HANK (CONT'D)

Thank you. We’1ll go say hi to our
own families now. Y’all have a
great day.

The ceremony ends. Laura makes her way off the stage a little
shakily. Below on the runway, her family awaits.

DREW
There’s my girl.

Laura’s daughter RUTH (15) is a few paces away. Laura’s
twins, NEIL and ED (6), hold foil “Welcome Home” balloons.
They see her, and --

NEIL AND ED
MOM!!!

-- come running for her, arms outstretched, their BALLOONS
flying away. Even Ruth is tearing up. The boys hit their
mother at full speed--

LAURA
-- Oof.

Laura bundles them into her arms. Kisses every smiling face.
Drew puts his arms around Laura. She leans into him.

DREW
We missed you so much.

He gives them all a big hug that lifts her off the ground--
LAURA
Careful. I might break.

Laura at the centre of a bundle of her family looks up.

ANGLE ON THE SKY

As the balloons float up and up towards the clouds.

CUT TO:

INT. FRANK PAXTON’S OFFICE. CAPE CANAVERAL, FL - LATER

Laura waits as Paxton thumbs through a flight report. His
office is a museum to the last 30 years. Photos of his
identical haircut over years, overseeing construction of a
prototype ENTERPRISE, posing with SALLY RIDE, JOHN GLENN etc.

PAXTON
So. How do you feel?

LAURA
Walking’s more of a pain in the ass
than I remember.

PAXTON
Get’s easier. How was it?

LAURA
Mission accomplished, sir.

PAXTON
That’s not what I asked.

LAURA
Best two weeks of my life.

Paxton smiles up from his paperwork. For all his work he’s
never been to space. This is as close as he’ll ever get.

LAURA (CONT'D)
Boat ran like a clock. Systems held
up. Crew were top class.

PAXTON
There'll be a routine psych follow
up at 3 days, 14 and 30 to 45 —
just to go over lessons learned in
hindsight and help you adjust to
your new role on the ground.

LAURA
It’s not necessary.
12.

PAXTON
Well, it’s regulation, so -- any
confusion up there? Panic?

LAURA
I'll admit, first time you step out
of that bay -- it’s not nothing.

PAXTON
Did you feel any immediate danger?

LAURA
We all took the same risk.

PAXTON
You know what I mean.

Laura considers, wanting to give an honest answer.

LAURA
Sir, I never felt so alive.

Paxton smiles. He sits back from his desk.

PAXTON
I’1l be honest, I don’t know how
many more of these launches we’re
gonna do.

LAURA
That’s a mistake.

PAXTON
I know, but -- a lotta suits in
Washington think our budget’d be
better spent elsewhere. Bombs
maybe. But in the meantime,
Atlantis is around the corner for
us --

LAURA
-- Two years to blastoff, sir.

PAXTON
And we'll need a Mission
Specialist. Would you be willing to
return?

Laura has to stop herself from blurting out: ABSOLUTELY.
3h

LAURA
I hope to serve NASA and my country
any way I can for as long as I can.

CUT TO:
INT. WAITING ROOM. PAXTON’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

Paxton escorts Laura into a waiting area, where a MAN leans
against the wall and thumbs through an old issue of Time.

PAXTON
You’re one of the good ones,
Wallace.

MAN (0.S.)
-- not what you said when I got
back.

The man smiles, MARK GOODWIN, a 45-year-old All-American type
with an edge of surfer.

PAXTON
That oughta tell you something. You
met Mark Goodwin? In from Houston.
He’s the driver seat for the
Endeavour launch.

(to Mark)

Our other pilots are all busy that
day huh?

MARK
I believe every single one, sir.

LAURA
(offers her hand)
Laura Wallace. Wow. You go --
January 27th right? Congrats.

MARK
An honour to serve. How was it?

He points up and whistles an ascending note. Laura laughs.

LAURA
Amazing.

MARK
Amazing.

He stares at her. No sale. She’s wrong footed. The moment
hangs. It’s awkward. Laura draws breath to speak when --
14.

MARK (CONT'D)
Ok, there it is.

LAURA
Excuse me?

MARK
Yeah. Wow.

LAURA

Sorry. There what is?

MARK
Plain as day.

PAXTON
Commander Goodwin has a “theory” he
can tell who’s been to space by
looking at them.

MARK
More than a theory, chief.

Laura is a little thrown. Mark sees her self-consciousness.

MARK (CONT'D)
It’s OK. Coming back is hard.

LAURA
Teel

Laura throws a nervy glance at Paxton. Mark sees and smiles.

MARK
Already trying to get back there,
aren’t you? You go get ‘em, tiger.

He throws a loose salute and walks away. She watches him go.
All the way.

Laura snaps out of a daze to see Paxton disappearing --
LAURA
Wait, sir? Where do I report to
now?
He shrugs re-entering his office.
PAXTON

Nowhere. Go home with your family.
Month paid leave starts now.
5

Laura tries to return his grin but doesn’t quite manage it.

CUT TO:
EXT. TWO LANE BLACKTOP. HOUSTON, TX - DAY
The Wallace SUV heads home.
DREW (0.S.)
I'm saying it’s a choice.
CUT TO:

INT. SUV (TRAVELING) HOUSTON, TX - DAY

Drew drives. Laura is in the passenger seat. The kids are in
back. Laura looks out the window, taking in her return --
trees, houses. But also trash on the side of the road. All
the problems of mankind, right where she left them.

DREW
You're either -- the kind of person
who sees problems, or you see

solutions.
Ed and Neil bicker in the backseat.

RUTH
They kicked him outta school.
What’s the spin there?

LAURA
Who?

DREW
Her boyfriend.

RUTH
He’s not my -- he’s Jenny’s
boyfriend and he got expelled for
blowing up a toilet with a cherry
bomb. Turn that into a public
relations win.

DREW
Well, maybe your school was the
wrong school for him. Maybe this is
the push he needs to get his act
together. See? The glass is half
full, not half empty.

RUTH
What do you think, mom?
16.

LAURA
I think the glass is too big.

RUTH
What does that mean?

DREW
Your mom’s an engineer.

Laura turns in her seat, explains.

LAURA
See, if you got a glass that’s only
ever filled half way, you've got
more glass than you need to get the
job done.

The kids look at her like she’s from Mars.
A CEILING FAN
dissolves in over her face, spinning in the Texas heat.

CUT TO:
INT. MASTER BEDROOM. WALLACE HOUSE. HOUSTON, TX - EVENING
Laura and Drew (dressed) lay on top of the made bed, looking
up. Laura’s packed bags are in evidence by the closet. We

hear sound of life from the rest of the house.

LAURA
The azaleas look good.

DREW
I watered them every day.
(beat)
Or I would have, if I didn’t
forget. Those are new. I put em in
this morning.

LAURA
I missed you.
DREW
Yeah?
(beat)

Babe, we went to space.
He looks over at her.

DREW (CONT'D)
I’m so proud of you.
Lie

LAURA
It was -- I don’t know -- it’s hard
to put in words.

DREW
I bet.

LAURA
To be up there.

DREW
Did you see the Great Wall of
China? How about Texas? See us
waving up from the back lawn?

-- Ed runs past their doorway screaming, a LIT SPARKLER in
his hand. Drew sits up.

DREW (CONT'D)
Ed Wallace! Freeze, boy. Get back
here.

Ed tromps back into the bedroom, sad-faced now, the sparkler
still burning.

DREW (CONT'D)
Never bring a lit anything into
this house? Not a candle, not a

match -- certainly not a firework.
LAURA

Sparkler.
DREW

You know the rules, boy. Bed. Now.
Ed looks like he might cry.

LAURA
I did miss the 4th.

Ed looks up, sensing an opening.

ED
You get sparklers up there?

LAURA
Not even one.
(whispers)
Maybe you and me ought to do
something about it. Don’t tell Dad.
Got any more where this came from?

Ed has a giant smile across his face.
18.

-- KA-BOOM-- FIREWORKS EXPLODING.

CUT TO:
EXT. WALLACE BACKYARD - LATER
-- the home-variety but it’s still an impressive display.
-- A LIT FLAME LIGHTS FUSES -- as Laura runs around lighting

mortars, black cats, cherry bombs. The twins look on in awe.
Drew pulls Ruth to a safe distance.

LAURA
-- I’m being careful.
DREW
Laura, that’s too close!-
-- POP POP POP POP -- inches from her face, a series of
bottle rockets spray off in all directions -- LAURA YELLS IN
DELIGHT.

Everything SLOWS DOWN, the fireworks becoming abstract. In
the darkness we might not notice the EDGES OF FRAME WIDENING,
as the fire light becomes --

THE ELEMENTAL INFERNO OF A SHUTTLE BOOSTER AT LIFT OFF --
and we --

CUT TO:
INT. MAIN CABIN. SPACE SHUTTLE DISCOVERY - DAY
Now back in WIDE SCREEN. Laura is pressed into her seat as
Discovery lifts high from the ground. She yells into the
helmet. Fighting real pain.
Pressure three times gravity pins her head. A deafening
rattle grows louder and louder, swallowing all sound. In the

corner of her eye she sees HANK, fighting to hit a switch.

HANK
Separation in three! Two --

There’s a lurch forward as Discovery’s solid rocket boosters
decouple and fall, slowing the orbiter’s momentum. Brief
respite as Laura is pinned to her seat as thrusters engage.

She grimaces. If the vibrations don’t shake the shuttle to
pieces they might her. It slows. Sheer hell recedes.

In a cabin window, day gives way to night in seconds, real
life on timelapse as Laura breaks past the edge of the world.
19F

She floats. She can breath again.
Tears fill her eyes. She looks out of the window at stars.

Outside, A SINGLE FIREWORK detonates. Its bloom filling the
view.

BACK TO:
EXT. WALLACE BACKYARD - NIGHT

Sparkling fireworks fade into the night sky. With the fade,
the edges of the screen shrink back to 4:3.

WE FIND Laura leaning on the house, staring up. She sips a
beer. Drew works the grill.

DREW
Y'all done burning down the
subdivision? We are almost eating
here --

Ruth, texting on her phone, ignores the family.

LAURA
Hey. Come over here.

RUTH
Pourquoi?

LAURA

Just do it missy.

Ruth stomps to her mom. Laura pulls into her, wrapping both
her arms around, resting her chin on top of her head.

LAURA (CONT'D)
Did you grow while I was gone?

RUTH
How could that even be possible?
You were gone like a week?

LAURA
Thirteen days thanks for counting.
Wait. What did I miss? Spill.

Laura tickles her daughter who fights her off but there’s a
hint of a smile on Ruth’s lips. It'd disappear in a second if
anyone could see. Laura kisses her and relents into a hug.

RUTH
Dad killed your azaleas and bought
new ones from Lowe's.

(MORE )
20.

RUTH (CONT'D)
Ed got mad coz they’1ll never name a
hurricane after him. Neil ate five
popsicles and puked in the yard.

LAURA
I meant with you. What’s up?

RUTH
Me? Well. I had my first period.

LAURA
Oh my god! Ruth!!?

RUTH
And I got a man-friend. He got me
pregnant coz of the whole new womb
sitch so I'll prolly get anorexic
about that. Gonna get into drugs
this weekend to cheer myself up. Oh
I’m totes gay. So no wedding,
chill?

Ruth pecks her mother on the cheek and walks away.
LAURA
So long as you’re happy.
(beat)
You were joking about the thing
right?
Laura gestures south. Ruth disappears back into her phone.

RUTH
Rad heart-to-heart, mom. Nailed it.

LAURA
You know I missed you, right?!!

CUT TO:
INT. KITCHEN. WALLACE HOUSE - DAY
The next morning. Laura wanders in, wearing her bathrobe,
looking groggy. Drew is dressed for work, a “NASA Public

Relations” I.D. around his neck, slurping cereal.

DREW
Hi, sleepyhead. How’s rocket lag?

LAURA
What time is it? Where’re the kids?
2ye

DREW
Half eight. Carpool picked ‘em up.
I better be going too --

Drew sets the bowl in the sink past Laura, kiss on the cheek.

DREW (CONT'D)
-- we're almost done cutting all
the footage together from the
mission. I’ve got Commander Lynch
coming in later to start the
interviews for the press kit. Not
all on vacation you know.

LAURA
You know how I love a vacation.

DREW
You earned it. Enjoy. You OK?

LAURA
I'm fine. Getting used to -- stuff.

DREW
I get it. Just rest. Mission
accomplished. My hero.

He kisses the top of Laura’s head and leaves for work. Laura
stands in her pajamas in the middle of her kitchen. Marooned.

CLOSE UP ON LAURA
Fuck it. She can’t just sit around.

CUT TO:
EXT. ASSISTED LIVING FACILITY. HOUSTON, TX - DAY

An upscale old folks home situated on a golf course. We FIND
AN OLD WOMAN sitting on her first floor patio, a low patio
wall between her and the links. She has the nasal plugs of an
OXYGEN line in her nose. This is MIRIAM “NANA” HOLBROOK, the
materfamilias, a woman who can do the Sunday Times crossword
puzzle in under an hour and then kill a rattlesnake with a
shovel.

As we watch Nana raises a cigarette to her lips.
LAURA
There are better ways to kill
yourself than smoking with your
oxygen machine.

Nana turns. Laura is there, holding a tool box.
220

NANA
How's that, fucker?

Laura kisses her Nana on the head, sits down next to her.

LAURA
Well, I’m back.

NANA
(teasing)
Did you go somewhere?

LAURA
Up, then down.

Beat. Nana smokes.

NANA
You show those Ivy League assholes
how it’s done?

LAURA
Damn straight.

Beat. They watch the golfers.

NANA
(beat)
Your father played golf. Said it
was good for business.

LAURA
He was unemployed.

NANA
He was an idiot.
(looks over)
You here to make sure I’m still
breathing?

LAURA
Drew said your disposal’s out.

CUT TO:
INT. NANA’S APARTMENT. ASSISTED LIVING FACILITY - DAY
Laura lays on the floor, her head and arms buried in the

cabinet under the sink. She’s working the disposal with a
screwdriver.

LAURA
I’m supposed to be on vacation.
I’ve already color coded three
rooms in my house and signed up for
six school committees.

Nana sits on a red scooter, watching. She pours some whiskey
in her coffee.

NANA
You should get a hobby, like me.

LAURA
Drinking’s not a hobby.

NANA
Well, government says I’m too old
to do it professionally.

Laura comes out from under the sink, wipes grease on her
pants.

LAURA
Fixed.

She stands, goes to wash her hands.

NANA
They giving you a medal?

LAURA
NASA? For what? All I did was my
job.

NANA

Good girl. No special treatment.
When’s the next mission?

LAURA
Endeavour goes in a few weeks.
Atlantis is in two years. That’s my
shot.

Beat. Nana studies her.

NANA
Well, you’re not getting any
younger.

Laura nods.

NANA (CONT'D)
So you're just gonna have to work
harder.
24.

CLOSE UP ON LAURA
She can do that.

CUT TO:
EXT. TRACK. LYNDON B. JOHNSON SPACE CENTER - AFTERNOON
Laura runs hard on the training facility’s outdoor track,
behind her looms the gigantic SATURN V ROCKET, casting a long
shadow over the track in the afternoon sun.
She's suddenly aware of a shadow gaining on her from behind.
A young woman, tall, athletic, ERIN ECCLES (20s) wearing a
NASA CADET tracksuit pushes past her, apparently without much
effort. Laura watches her pull away.

On the next lap the same girl is doing “clap up” press ups on
the grass by the track. Controlled. Strong. Easy.

With a burst of energy, Laura sprints. It’s intense, ugly
running - pushing the limit. She doubles over, sweat pouring.

Relax. You’ll run faster.

Mark jogs past. Laura tries to speak between breaths. Fails.

MARK (CONT'D)
Loose. No hurry. Just -- let go.

Mark rips into an fluid upright sprint action. We linger on
her. As Mark disappears at impressive speed, he bellows:

MARK (CONT'D)
KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!!!

-- at a comical volume. Laura laughs, shaking her head.
CUT TO:
EXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. HOUSTON, TX - DAY

Laura sits in the SUV, doing pickup like a regular parent.
She watches the daily routine of other families.

This is how civilians do it -- leisurely, like there’s all
the time in the world, like nothing else exists in the
universe, not even death.
To calm herself, Laura begins to mutter a checklist.
LAURA

Connect urine tranfer filter to
faeces PD. Check.

Coming out the front doors.
ANGLE ON LAURA

not seeing them, focused on the checklist. We PUSH IN on her

There is a PORTAL WINDOW beside her. Halfway through the

ANGLE ON TWO ASTRONAUTS

tethered and floating outside, framed by the Earth’s
atmosphere.

SUDDENLY --

THE REAR DOORS of the SUV OPEN, the boys climbing in. Laura
starts at the noise, turns.

NEIL
Hey, mom.

ED
Hey.
26.

LAURA
Hey, guys. How was -- sorry -- how
was school today?
Ed leans forward.

ED
What’s a cocksucker?

CUT TO:
INT. BOY’S ROOM. WALLACE HOUSE. HOUSTON, TX - NIGHT
The boys are asleep in their beds. We FIND LAURA in the
doorway. She studies them. Over their beds are mobiles of the
planets. All their toys are space toys, the posters on the
wall.
Laura studies the planets spinning above their beds on the
mobile. She goes down the hall. Music comes out of Ruth’s
room. The door is open a crack. Laura looks in.
ANGLE ON RUTH
She's on the bed, Facetiming with a friend. She laughs,
happy. She looks up, sees her mother -- sticks out her
tongue, but playfully.
ANGLE ON LAURA

She waves. She should be happy, but she feels outside of
everything.

CUT TO:
INT. MASTER BEDROOM. WALLACE HOUSE - NIGHT
Laura and Drew are in bed. They make love.
CLOSE ON LAURA
She loves her husband. She’s trying to be present.
ANGLE ON DREW

Above her, absorbed, worshipping her. The EDGES OF FRAME
vibrate around him, trying to burst free, to open up.

CLOSE ON LAURA

She gives herself to the act -- trying to fake it till she
makes it.
Blo
The world around them opens slightly, and for a moment it
seems Laura will escape her head, but then DREW FINISHES --
The walls close in again.
He rolls off her, breathing hard, snuggles up.

DREW
I missed you, pooh bear.

He closes his eyes. Laura lays beside him, looking at the
ceiling.

PLIMPTON (0.S.)
And you're settling back in?

CUT TO:
INT. WILL PLIMPTON’S OFFICE. JOHNSON SPACE CENTER - DAY

Laura sits across from Will Plimpton, the Nasa psychiatrist.

LAURA
Never settle. My Nana taught me
that.

PLIMPTON

(beat)
How are you feeling physically?

LAURA
I'm in top shape, sir.

PLIMPTON
After just a few days in zero
gravity your bone and muscle mass
begin to shrink dramatically. You
were up two weeks. I’ve seen men
carried off the shuttle, too weak
to stand.

Laura stands, showing him she’s fine.

PLIMPTON (CONT’D)
Frank told me you graduated top of
your class from the naval academy,
valedictorian in both high school
and college. I guess my question is
-- can you stop?

LAURA
Stop what?
28.

PLIMPTON
Working.

LAURA
I’m an astronaut with three kids.
When exactly am I supposed to stop?

PLIMPTON
Aren’t you on paid vacation right
now?
(she nods)
And didn’t I see you on the track
here yesterday, and in the gym this
morning?

LAURA
Bone density. Muscle mass.

PLIMPTON
Throw a frisbee. Fly a kite.

Laura laughs at a private thought.

PLIMPTON (CONT’D)

What?
LAURA
My Nana says frisbees are for dogs.
PLIMPTON
Tell me about her.
LAURA
Miriam Holbrook -- fifth generation
west Texan, Daughter of the
American Revolution -- husband died

in a drilling accident, raised
three kids by herself, got her
engineering degree at night.

PLIMPTON
So -- tough.

Beat. Laura thinks about that. To her Nana is just what a
woman needs to be. No adjectives necessary.

LAURA
Three guys chased my dad home from
school one day with axe handles.
She put the first warning shot in
the dirt.

PLIMPTON
The first.
297.

LAURA
In Texas a leg shot’s considered a
warning.
PLIMPTON
(beat, then)
Why were they chasing him?
LAURA
Who?
PLIMPTON
Your dad.
LAURA
He pissed in the gas tank of their
car.

Beat. They think about that -- where she got her drive and
strength, because it wasn’t from her father.

PLIMPTON
Take a walk, go to the beach.

LAURA
I will.

He studies her. She’s lying.

PLIMPTON
Michael Collins.

LAURA
Apollo 11. He piloted the moon
lander that delivered Neil and
Buzz.

PLIMPTON
So you know that after he dropped
them, he circled the moon for
hours, farther from Earth than any

man has ever been -- no light, no
radio. And he wept, consumed by
darkness, and then -- when he saw
the sun again -- he wept some more.

Inside the capsule he wrote: I am
now truly alone and absolutely
alone from any known life. I am it.

Beat. What can she say to that? The words are like live wires
she doesn’t want to touch.

LAURA
I’m fine.
30.

PLIMPTON
You need rest -- and time. To
process what happened. To ground
yourself. Literally.

ANGLE ON LAURA
As she thinks about that.

CUT TO:
INT. CAFETERIA. JOHNSON SPACE CENTER - DAY
Laura carries a tray to a table. She is hailed by everyone as
she walks -- a returning hero. She approaches FRANK PAXTON.
He is standing with ERIN ECCLES the young woman from the
running track.
If Laura is the Terminator, Erin is the T-1000; newer,
faster, more cunning. But she’s also kind, hopeful, an

optimist.

Paxton sees Laura.

PAXTON

Wallace, got your sea legs back?
LAURA

Yes, sir.
PAXTON

This is Erin Eccles. She’s training
for the Atlantis mission.

Erin sticks out her hand.

ERIN
It’s an honor.

Laura shakes her hand.

LAURA
I saw you on the track this
morning.

ERIN
Right.

LAURA

You need to keep your head up.

ERIN
(taken aback)
I'll -- thanks for the tip.
Say

PAXTON
Laura’s in the running for Atlantis
too.

LAURA

Can't beat experience.

Beat. Laura holds Erin’s eye, but Erin doesn’t back down.
Paxton sees the tension, doesn’t try to defuse it.

PAXTON
Okay, well -- good luck to you
both.
He walks away.
ERIN

He seems like a good guy.

LAURA
A real pro.

ERIN
So what's it like up there? Must be
quite a rush.

LAURA
It’s a job, kid. Not kite-boarding
off Kuai. Remember that when you're
on a three axe spin at four G's.

ERIN
Thanks. Do you think maybe -- I
don’t know -- I could call you
sometime for advice?

This takes Laura off guard. She softens.

LAURA
Sure.

ERIN
Great. Do you have a cell phone,
granny, or are you still on a land
line?

Beat. Laura smiles. Fuck you, too.

LAURA
Chin up.

Laura walks away, finds a table, pushes her food around,
watching Erin wander over and mingle with a GROUP OF MEN. Is
she flirting?

MARK (0.S.)
Hey, Moonglow.

Laura looks up. Mark is standing there with two young girls--
CHELSEA and EMILY, 9 and 6.

MARK (CONT'D)
I’m giving my ladies a tour.
Chelsea, Emily, this is Laura.
She’s a colleague of Daddy's.

CHELSEA
Are you an astronaut?

LAURA
Yes, I am.

Laura smiles, shooting a friendly salute. They salute back.

LAURA (CONT'D)
Great to meet you. Your Dad’s
always telling everyone how cool
you are.

They're thrilled to hear this. Mark mouths a “Thank You”-

MARK
You know girls, Laura here was in
space last week. Maybe you’ve got a
question for her?

Laura smiles as they struggle to come up with anything --

EMILY
Uhm --

CHELSEA
Where'd you get that brownie?

LAURA
Over there. And they’re so good.

Mark offers five bucks which they snatch and go running:

MARK
Don’t tell mom you ate that!
(to Laura)
Separated. It’s a lot of work.

LAURA
They seem like great kids.

MARK
They are. Do you bowl?
33)

LAURA
What?

MARK
Bowling. Indigenous cultural praxis
of the North Americas? Promotes
social cohesion via pointless
competition, alcohol abuse and
shared footwear.

-- Mark eats the end of her brownie. She notices.

LAURA
With you and the girls?

MARK
With the club. You’re a member now.

LAURA
What club?

Mark flags two astronauts passing by. He points both fingers -

MARK
Roll tonight?

JIM
Yep.

PETE
Yep.

Mark points to Laura and looks expectant --

LAURA
What _ club?

MARK
The most select group formed in the
history of mankind.

Mark solemnly taps a patch on his flightsuit. A rolling Earth
scatters tenpins, NASA and CRB embroidered above and below.

MARK (CONT'D)
A secret society where every member
has been to heaven to look upon the
face of God. The one. The only:
Circle of the Rolling Ball.

Laura waves him off laughing --
Just then,

34.

LAURA
Fun as that sounds -- I’m not
really a joiner. Plus kids and blah
blah -- dinner don’t make itself.
MARK

Earth families. You got a new
family now. Semper volvens.

LAURA
You want me to say that to my
husband? That -- bad latin.

MARK
Tell him it’s training. That’s what
the rest of us do.

Emily and Chelsea return, with a tray of desserts.

MARK (CONT'D)
Sugarlanes 8pm. Ask for Wernher von
Braun.

LAURA
I know. I told them. But it’s just -
- simple stuff. More of a debrief.
I won’t be late.

DREW (0.S.)
Well, if it’s good for NASA, I
guess it’s a win for me too.

LAURA
That's the spirit.

She hangs up.

INT. SUGARLAND LANES. HOUSTON, TX - NIGHT
CLOSE UP ON A BOWLING BALL

It arcs through the air, landing on a waxed lane headed into
the triangle of hope --

-- CRASH -- pins tumble and spin leaving a badly split spare.

LAURA
Darn it.

By the ball return, Mark pals around with Pete and Jim.

JIM
Trajectory apex error.

LAURA
I like the challenge. Make it a
little fairer on you boys.

Laura takes a swig from a Yuengling. Mark brandishes her ball

MARK
May I?

LAURA
Depends. You got any idea what
you're talking about?

MARK
My great grandfather invented this
game. Swear to god. Great great.

Mark close to Laura, cupping her hand in his-- AND DRAWS her
arm back in large, slow practice throws.

MARK (CONT'D)
Secret is -- little twist at the
end there. You see?

Laura feels the closeness of his body. They move together.
LAURA
Lil’ twist? You coach the boys like
this, that the secret in this club?

JIM
We ask him not to. Gets so weird.
36.

PETE
Help us. Can you?

JIM
The secret is he’s hammered.

MARK
Oh, that’s no secret at all.

Mark heads to his beer but not before calling out to Laura:

MARK (CONT'D)
Remember what I told you!

Laura steps up to the line. She takes a deep breath before
heaving the ball down the lane and -- PICKS UP THE SPARE!

The astronauts go berserk. Laura rains high fives.

MARK (CONT'D)
Go on. Say it.

LAURA
All student, no teacher.

MARK
I like it. I’1l take that. And now
“the Teacher” steps up. Gathers.

Mark grabs a ball, winds up -- flexes wildly and slides to
the line. Hurls the rock where it soars and--

-- skews hard into the gutter. Mark holds his perfect form.

MARK (CONT'D)
And shake hands with the kingpin.

Laura and the guys fall about laughing.
CUT TO:

LATER -- the astronauts shoot the shit post-game. Laura
notices Mark up at the bar making the barmaid laugh.

PETE
How you doing since you got back?

JIM
Tongue still feel weird?

LAURA
YES! What is that?!
PETE
No one knows. They think the brain
adjusts to speaking in zero G. Goes
in about a week.

LAURA
I’m great. Pretty great. Feel a
little like -- I don’t know.

Y'know?

The astronauts nod in unison.

PETE
You crack up yet?
LAURA
I'm sorry?
PETE
Not a question of if, just when.
JIM
How hard.
PETE
Amen.
LAURA
Wait -- what are you saying?
PETE

Saying watch yourself for the first
few months. You saw what few people
ever see. Felt things no one feels.
Don’t go walking around pretending
you're like everyone else and life
is what you always thought it was.

LAURA
Why not?

JIM
Because you’1ll lose your shit. Plus
it isn’t the truth. Is it?
Laura stares levelly back at them. She opens a fraction.

LAURA
What is?

JIM
Beats the shit out of me.

S/o
38.

PETE
Me too. And yet, here we all are.
Right here. No place else.

JIM
Right now. No time else.

PETE
Just like we all saw. Right?

Mark swings in, placing an armful of beers on the table.

MARK
As requested: five Yuenglings.

JIM
And four of us, Professor.

MARK
How could this have happened?

MARK AND PETE AND JIM IN UNISON
Must’ve been a rounding error.

Laura laughs.

JIM
That’s why he likes you so much.
You laugh at his old jokes.

MARK

Only old joke here is you, buddy.
LAURA

Ouch.
MARK

Come on. We love each other.

PETE
I assure you, we do not.

MARK
Then how come we shared all the
sordid details of our entire lives?

LAURA
Ooh sordid details? Like what?

PETE
I could have done without it.

JIM
Me too. Some of that stuff --

LAURA
C’mon. Spill.

MARK
Nothing. I’m a saint.

EXT. WALLACE HOUSE. HOUSTON, TX - MIDNIGHT

Mark’s truck rolls up the driveway. Mark bails to the
passenger side, making an exaggerated bow --

LAURA
And a gentleman.

Laura laughs, returning the gesture with a regal nod. On her
way out of the truck, Laura SLIPS, falling onto Mark.

MARK
Still working on those Earth legs?

LAURA
Or just intoxicated.

Laura regains her footing, bracing against Mark. She looks up
at her house, lets out a wistful sigh. Mark nods.

MARK
You don’t know what to tell them.
That’s OK. You can’t. Not really.

LAURA
(realization dawning)
They’11 never know.

MARK
You’re lucky here. Remember that.
Might not seem like it. But you
are. They need you. You need them.

LAURA
Do you ever stop missing it?
40.

MARK
I wish I could lie, but I can’t.
You can turn away and hide, but I’m
afraid there’s nothing like it.

Laura is suddenly aware it’s unclear whether he means space,
NASA or a house with a family waiting. They’re inches apart.

LAURA
I better go.

Mark nods, stepping back. Laura heads unsteadily inside.

MARK
See you on deck, sailor.

Laura finds her asleep, hand marking place in a Harry Potter.
Laura carefully dog-ears her page. Puts the book away.

As she watches her daughter sleep, Laura chokes up suddenly,
overcome with emotion. Desperate.

She crouches down hugging her knees and looks up at Ruth’s

ceiling, covered in glow-in-the-dark plastic stars and heaves
huge silent sobs as her daughter softly sleeps.

INT. SHUTTLE SIMULATOR. JOHNSON SPACE CENTER - DAY

Laura, Mark, Hank and Erin --in astronaut gear-- strapped
into a shuttle simulator that’s nearly as old as they are.

A machine built in the 70’s -- slow and prone to breaking
down. The astronauts busily check their instruments as --

-- A FLASHING RED LIGHT FILLS THE CABIN --

Erin’s thumbing through a second binder. A second, more
staccato siren begins SHRIEKING.

LAURA
Need action here, Eccles.

ERIN
Almost there --

HANK
02 dropping. Venting fast.

Erin is throwing switches on her console. No luck.

MARK

ERIN

Erin focuses, finds it, flips a series of switches on her
console -- flashing lights and sirens suddenly STOP.
Everything still.

ERIN
Got it.

Beat. They wait, then --

Mark takes off his headseat.
MARK
Nice work, legs. Well -- who’s

CUT TO:
INT. MARK’S OFFICE. JOHNSON SPACE CENTRE - DAY
KNOCK KNOCK. Laura pokes her head in to see --

-- Mark, fast asleep at his desk. The tinny sounds of Steely
Dan coming from an early iPhone on his desk.

Laura closes the door quietly and walks over to him. She
leans close, getting just inches from his face--

-- and SLAMMING HER HAND ON HIS DESK-- Mark startled awake,
gasps a big, shocked breath. Laura laughs. Mark plays cool.

MARK
I’m awake. I am. Wide awake.

LAURA
What you doing for lunch?

Mark places a paper bag on his desk.

MARK
Got a packed lunch.

She reaches into the bag, pulls out a SIX-PACK OF BUDWEISER.

It’s late notice but I could see if
the maitre D has a table for two.
CUT TO:
EXT. SECLUDED ROAD. JOHNSON SPACE CENTER - DUSK

Laura’s SUV parked on a SIDE ROAD in the Johnson Complex. The
decommissioned Saturn V Rocket visible from her windshield.

Inside, Mark and Laura split an order of fries. Mark pops the
top of a can of beer; hands it to Laura.

As she sips, a car drives by. Laura repositions to hide the
fact she’s drinking. Mark laughs at Laura’s cautiousness.

LAURA
It’s like we’re back in high school
smoking under the bleachers.
45.

Mark takes a big swig from his can.

MARK
You never smoked under no
bleachers. Uh uh.

LAURA
What? Why?

MARK
You're a straight arrow. You never
did a wrong thing in your life.

LAURA
I've done plenty of things wrong.

MARK
I bet you never even came second.

Beat. It’s true.

LAURA
Look, Mr. Know-it-all, I done
plenty of tawdry shit, I’m here to
tell ya --

MARK
Hit me.

Laura thinks for a moment but she is genuinely stumped.

MARK (CONT'D)
How about -- smoking under the
bleachers?

LAURA
Nope. Never did that.

Mark laughs and takes another sip. He stares out the
passenger window and sighs. He suddenly seems very lost.

LAURA (CONT'D)
Hey, you okay?

MARK
Yeah. My kids --
(sighs)
-- none of this is easy.

Laura nods. She thinks. Then --
LAURA

The other night the guys were
talking about being in orbit --
46.

MARK
You felt it right? Up there.

Laura stops. This is a step out of her comfort zone.

LAURA
Felt what?

MARK
You tell me. Maybe you didn’t.

She searches for words to describe the indescribable.

LAURA
Like being blasted completely apart
and put back together and instantly
I felt like -- I felt like --

MARK
You understood it all.

LAURA
Yes. Oh my god. Yes. What the hell?

MARK
A sense that everything’s a part of
everything else. All separation
between things is illusion.

LAURA
Out of nowhere. I was looking down.
I realized -- I realized --

MARK
You realized who you are and why
we're all here. Right? We’re the
fringe that feels.

Laura is suddenly wide open. She leans and KISSES HIM, fully
and deeply -- just as quickly, she pulls away.

LAURA
God I’m so sorry. I can’t do this.

MARK
What are we doing? We’re just kids
smoking under the bleachers.

He leans and kisses her. Laura kisses back. More passionate
than the first. She reaches for his belt. They pull at each
other. Urgent. Hungry. Unstoppable.

As they do EVERYTHING SHAKES around them -- as if they’re
strapped to a booster rocket.
47.

THE EDGES OF FRAME SLIDE AWAY -- the claustrophobia of her
world expanding -- the adrenaline and wonder of space
returning.

Mark pushes a hand down her body into her pants. She gasps.
Kissing deeply, Laura pushes into him. Yanking hard at his
jeans, her hands grab his bare ass. And they start to fuck.
OVERHEAD

The ROOF OF THE SUV shudders, separating, the SKY revealed.
THEY BEGIN TO RISE out of the car, the blue sky above turning
black, STARS surrounding them.

face.

LAURA
Okey. Dokey.

She forcibly releases a white-knuckle grip on the steering
wheel, trying to collect herself and spots a crushed beer can
in the footwell. She dives to grab it before anyone sees.

She drops it in the recycling container, drops the lid and
takes a deep breath.

Nana’s purse is on the hall table. Laura grabs it, but
misses, knocking it over. Her wallet and cigarettes spill
out, and something else -- A HANDGUN.

ANGLE ON LAURA

Seeing it. She looks around to see if anyone else saw, but
the hall is empty. She picks up the gun, holds it. A .38
special.

NANA (CONT'D)

Laura lowers the gun. She thinks about putting it back in
Nana’s purse, but doesn’t feel comfortable with the idea. She
opens the coat closet, puts the gun in her jacket pocket.

The test director hits an abort button and the exit elevator

Laura struggles with the back of her helmet trying to locate
the source of the breach, she tugs at the seal and suddenly
water floods her helmet upside down.

LAURA
Shit.

SUPPORT DIVERS from all over the pool move into action,
heading for Laura. Laura looks at a gauge. She speaks calmly.

She takes a last breath. Blinks. Calm as water fills her nose

search her suit extremities for where she is stuck.

Laura remains calm. Points accurately to her tethered leg.
A diver sees where she’s indicating. He swims down and

unloops the loop of webbing. The heavy waterlogged suit
starts to float freely away from the structure.

Laura on a bench. Alone for the first time. She raises her

answers. Before she can say anything he is in full flow.

asking if you could give a talk to

Laura blinks hard, still shaking. There’s no way she can tell
Drew what just happened in the tank.

LAURA
Ok. Uh-huh.

DREW
Be great to give them an answer
today. Can I confirm? PTA are gonna
love us for this.

The changing room door swings open. MARK rushes in, concern
and fear on his face. Laura raises her hand to stop him.

LAURA
Say yes. Listen, I gotta go.

Laura ends the call.

LAURA

We can not keep doing this.
MARK

You're probably right.
LAURA

OK. Good. So -- OK?

thinking, before I fly next month,
maybe we could find some time, just
us. Go away someplace.

Away? Where?

I can’t. I can’t get the time.

Have a drink. None of this means
anything anyway.

LAURA
What?

MARK
Look around. What do you see? A
desk, a chair, the place you work.
And out the window -- trees, houses
-- kids on skateboards. America.
You know what science sees?
Protons, neutrons, electrons.

He touches her chest.

MARK (CONT'D)

And this, us -- our hearts -- it’s
just blood and muscle -- atoms in
motion, energy being transferred.
It doesn’t mean anything. So why
not take our protons and electrons
and go to the beach? Live.

Laura runs hard, trying to keep her thoughts at bay. Ahead of
her she sees ERIN ECCLES, her stride easy, her form good.

Laura ACCELERATES.

ERIN turns, sees her coming, speeds up. The two women race.
Erin’s legs are longer, but she doesn’t have Laura’s drive.

Slowly, but surely Laura gains on her, pulls even.

CLOSE UP ON ERIN

The strain shows on her face. She looks over, uncertain.

She's in top shape again. If she has to, she’1ll run this

Laura’s at her desk, annotating technical manuals. She
continues reading as she opens her desk drawer and takes out
a small bottle. Knocks out two orange pills. Swallows cold

just a piece of folded over yellow paper.
Inside, the card reads: “Lunch? My truck or yours?”

CUT TO:
INT. MOTEL ROOM. HOUSTON, TX - EVENING
Laura and Mark fall back on a tangle of sheets. Laura turns
to Mark, watches him as he dozes. It’s possible he’s fallen

asleep right there. She whispers very quietly:

LAURA
I love you. I love you. I love you.

-- there’s no way Mark heard it. But then --

She pushes into him. He whispers in her ear:

We are BACK IN SPACE, in widescreen, Laura floating in her
space suit.

LAURA
That's so bright.

The Earth floats below her.

LAURA (CONT'D)
So bright.

Hypnotized, LAURA reaches up, unfastens her helmet, seduced
by the view. She LIFTS OFF HER HELMET, lets it float free.

Somewhere in her brain she believes she can do this, become a
being of pure light, celestial.

She takes a DEEP BREATH, and for a second it seems like it
will work -- she will transcend mortal bounds -- then her
face changes.
LAURA BEGINS TO CHOKE, her eyes start to bug out. Inside her
body, fluids begin to boil. ICICLES FORM on her eye lashes,
her skin turning blue.
She tries to scream, but nothing comes out.
As we watch she DRIFTS AWAY. We watch her go until she’s just
a white dot in the distance, another astral body floating
through infinite space.

Laura runs her hand up Mark’s leg but he pushes her away.
MARK
Not here. We're slipping. We have
to be more careful.

LAURA
Okay. Okay.

Laura pulls away, clearly hurt.

I've ever felt this good.
She closes her eyes -- floating in the vacuum of the moment.

His impatience shows. Maybe he’s not as into Laura as we
thought. He shakes her lightly.

LAURA
Oh. Okay, I’1l --

She sits up. He smiles at her, touches her face.

The news hits like a gut punch. Fear. Shame. Intense shock.

LAURA

LAURA
Is she OK?
DREW

Visiting hours from ten. I can take
you over there, I told work I’d --

LAURA
FOR GOD'S SAKE! Stop washing the
damn dishes and tell me she’s OK!

DREW
She hasn’t woken up --

He takes off the gloves, walks over and looks at her.
DREW (CONT'D)
If you’re here, I can take you in
the morning.

And without any physical contact he walks up to bed.

Laura stands in shock. She can’t respond to Drew’s coldness.
He knows? What does he know? Why is she thinking this now?

Laura reeling, sleepwalks to the sink. Picks up the dish Drew
put down. Suddenly she stops.

LAURA
If I’m here?

-- a droplet of water begins to float upwards from the sink,
as if suspended in zero gravity.

Laura looks on as a number of droplets float up from the
sink, followed by a dirty mug. She stares in terror as--
62.

-- she floats upwards. Laura pushes from the kitchen counter
floating through her house as if it were the innards of an
orbiting ship. Tears of shock and shame float from her eyes
as Laura pushes her way through the darkened house.

Each tear leaves her face sealed. A perfect sphere.
BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP. A hospital vitals monitor beats.

Inside the room, Laura holds Nana’s hand. The old woman looks
smaller now. fragile. Tubes and machinery are all that’s
connecting her to this world.

Laura squeezes her paper thin hands.

LAURA

I don’t want you to worry, Nana.
The doctors say you’re gonna be
just fine. You just need --

Get your lazy ass out of bed,
soldier. You’re not done here.

ear to Nana’s lips.

There. That work for you? Does that
make it all better? What? What?

Drew soaks it up. He looks straight ahead.

DREW
That glovebox was locked. I didn’t
know why so I got the key and I
unlocked it.

LAURA
How? Wait. You got the key?

DREW
Is not the point. The point is
you're driving around with a loaded
gun in your car so I need to know
why? You're acting so strange. I
never know where you’ll be. What
time you’re coming home. And now
with Wally in the hospital-

LAURA
-- you got the key off my key ring?

DREW
A gun. In here, Laura.

LAURA
Why would you do that?

DREW
And we don’t own a handgun.

LAURA
Why wouldn’t you just ask me? Wait
what did you think was in there?
DREW
FOR CHRISTS SAKE LAURA WHY IS THERE
A FUCKING GUN IN OUR CAR?
Laura looks like this is way -- way too much for her.

LAURA
I had to put it someplace safe.

This is hard to say out loud. Her compartments collapsing.

LAURA (CONT'D)
It’s Nana’s. She had it in her
purse when she came to dinner. I
didn’t feel -- I didn’t want her
walking around with it.

Drew reaches out for her but she shrinks away from him.

DREW
Why didn’t you tell me?

Laura gets out of the car.
LAURA
Why didn’t you ask? What did you
think I was doing?
Drew is open mouthed. Doesn’t know what to say. Laura walks.

RUTH
Can I come see her next time?

LAURA
Of course. She’d like that.

RUTH

Ruth runs off. Laura continues to fold and pile. Fold. Pile.
Lost in thought.

patch on her shoulder, helmet under arm. She looks nervous.

Laura lights up. She runs to Ruth, wrapping her up in a hug.
Ruth steps back so she can read her name badge: L.WALLACE.

Oh, sweetheart.

Laura hugs Ruth tighter; she begins to cry.

RUTH
Are you okay?
LAURA
I’m fine -- I’m perfect. You’re

perfect. I love you so much.
Laura shuts her eyes tightly as she squeezes her daughter.
AN ALARM SOUNDS.
Laura looks up. The same as the simulator. Ruth smiles
happily, walks out. Laura reaches for her but Ruth just keeps
walking. As though she can’t hear or see anything at all.

LIGHTS FLASH.

The laundry room vibrates with a pulsing, hot light. Laura’s
eyes widen. She looks around for a solution and then--

LAURA GRABS HER CELL PHONE.

A flicker on Mark's face -- closest we’ve seen him to losing

From his face we can see that he is NOT excited by this

side of the fence. Worse. Tannoy starts a direct audio feed.

LAURA
Oh shit. It’s gonna go.

The countdown clock rolls to ZERO. The crowd cheer.
Laura winces. Willing a skyscraper to soar. In the distance,

a BRIGHT FLASH of smoke and light as Endeavour'’s twin
boosters ignite. The lion roar of man. She holds her breath.

PETE (V.O.)
Liftoff. We have liftoff.

Endeavour arcs skyward, flame reflected on the water of the
Banana River. Every inch of ascent costing Laura everything.

LAURA
Clear the tower. Clear it.

Her beating heart the fuel of ascent. Inches past the tower.

LAURA (CONT'D)
Go. Yes! Go.

At this early hour, the booster is brighter than the rising
sun. Monstrous plumes of smoke and steam, thousands of feet
long billow from the launch site.

LAURA (CONT'D)

Go. GO! GO!!!
The small crowd thinly cheers -- how could they not?
Laura -- eyes fixed on the orbiter-- starts laughing with the

joy of it all. She looks around herself. Marooned on her home
planet. No one she can share anything with. Deeply alone.

there for you -- this was your
second ride on the big slingshot,
right?

HANK
Yes, I flew Columbia, March 2002.

Look, when you’re strapped to a ten
ton rocket full of explosive jet
fuel all you can do is hold on
tight.

On SCREEN we see footage of the astronauts in the cockpit
during takeoff.

ANGLE ON LAURA

Everything -- her time in space, her Nana’s death, the
intensity of the affair with Mark, and now his absence
literally from the Planet Earth -- is tying her brain in
knots.

DREW (0.S.)

And obviously, Endeavor is up there
right now, circling the globe
sixteen times a day. Any advice for
them?
Laura looks out into the audience, sees --

Sitting in the audience, smiling at her.
HANK (0.S.)
Yeah, get it done and come home

CLOSE UP ON LAURA

Her heart leaps. How is this possible? Did he come back just
for her?

She glances at her husband. Does he see? But Drew is talking.
Laura turns back.

ANGLE ON THE AUDIENCE

Mark is gone, a STRANGER sits in his seat. It was her mind
playing tricks. Her hopes.

you thinking at this moment?

Laura?

She turns.

LAURA
What?

ANGLE ON DREW

He nods encouragingly.

DREW

How was take off for you?
LAURA

Me? I’m -- well -- you hope

everything goes well. There’s
excitement. Mostly I’m just focused
on the job. We don’t get much time
up there. We’ve gotta make every
second count.

HENCKLE
She’s the serious one.

DREW
Says the German.

People laugh. Chithra speaks up.
CHITHRA

I‘'ll be honest. What I miss most is
the team --

On SCREEN we see the ASTRONAUTS in zero gravity -- they are
floating through the International Space Station -- at play --
swallowing balls of water that float and rotate.

CHITHRA (0.S.) (CONT’D)
-- the mission, moving together,
looking out for each other.

There’s an AIR BUBBLE inside one of the water bubbles and it
acts as a camera, exaggerating people’s faces.

ANGLE ON LAURA
watching the footage, remembering.

ON SCREEN
77.

We see the crew relaxed, goofing around. The camera finds
LAURA, her ponytail floating. We expect her to be the serious
Laura we've seen, but she is smiling widely.

The WATER BUBBLE floats between her and the camera. She makes
a face at it -- at us.

ANGLE ON DREW

watching his wife. He loves seeing her so happy. He looks
over at her on the stage.

CLOSE UP ON LAURA

She's crying a little, seeing herself up there, a simpler
time. What she wouldn’t give to go back.

ANGLE ON DREW

He assumes this is about her Nana’s death. He feels guilty.
It’s too soon. They should have rescheduled.

DREW
And, uh, Laura, you had a wedding
anniversary when you were in space,
didn’t you?

Laura wipes her face quickly.

LAURA
I did.

DREW
How many years?

LAURA

Drew -—

Seventeen years.

CHITHRA

Sorry. What are you talking about?
Chitra looks at her like -- come on. Gets nothing back.
CHITHRA

Mark. People talk Laura.

Laura checks reflexively. DREW is standing over by the
windows, schmoozing with some VIPs.

LAURA
Uh huh. About what?

CHITHRA
Fine. Whatever. Be very careful.
That’s all I’m saying.

LAURA
Of what? What do I need to be
careful of? Am I in danger here?
Are you threatening me?

CHITHRA
God no. I’m trying to -- Hey,
really never mind. Like for real.

Jesus.
She walks away. Laura is angry. Shouting after her.
LAURA
I don’t know what you’re talking
about. I'd never do anything as
dumb as you’re insinuating. I don’t
compromise myself OK? Not ever. If
you know me at all. You know that.

Chithra flips her the bird without turning. Laura, stares
back, breathing heavy, ready to hit someone --

Drew comes over, a PR smile plastered on his face.
DREW

Hey, beautiful. Whatdya say we get

you home? It’s been a long day.
Laura allows herself to be led towards the exit.

Erin thumbs her book too quickly, missing the section.

ERIN
Shit. Shit.

Stay frosty. Get it done.

ERIN

Erin starts hitting buttons. Nothing is working.

LAURA
Or there’s nothing left to bury.

ERIN
For God's sake.

Erin flips one last switch and --
The simulator shuts down. Failure.

LAURA
OK. Failure review. What happened?

ERIN
I’m sorry I --

LAURA
Is not good enough. Not in any
situation in here. You are not
prepared. You’re poorly prepared,
we fly we die. Understand?

ERIN
Yes.
LAURA
Failure to prepare is preparation
to fail.
ERIN
I get it.

No, you don’t. This isn’t some team

He swings at a pitch.

LAURA (V.O.)
I remember the moment I decided I

Yeah, I just -- I gotta finish this

She goes back to her note.

LAURA (V.O.)

lines against the night sky --
except one of the lines has a dot
in it. Just a little speck. You’d
miss it if you didn’t look hard.
And my teacher said -- that’s us.

AT THE PLATE
NEIL swings on a pitch, connects.

THE BALL leaps off his bat, headed for the outfield.

LAURA (V.O.)
Us. Millions of people on this tiny
blue ball. Floating in nothing.

THE OUTFIELDER charges the ball, but it drops.

LAURA (V.O.)
So precarious. So fragile.

ED TAKES OFF, running for third.

LAURA (V.O.)

And then -- to be up there. In
space. More alone, more vulnerable
than you've ever been in your life.

THE OUTFIELDER kicks the ball. NEIL rounds first.

LAURA (V.O.)

But instead of being afraid -- this
thing rises in you. Joy. To be part
of it. To see all of it.

THE THIRD BASE COACH waves ED home. He runs.

LAURA (V.O.)

I never felt anything like it my
entire life. Suddenly everything
that used to be important is
nothing at all, and things you
never even thought are everything
to you. It’s beautiful. To be here.
All of us. Every minute of our
lives. All we have to do -- is be.
Just be. Live it all. As real, as
hard as you can.

NEIL runs for second.

MARY
Don’t push your luck, flyboy.

MARK
There any other way to play?

Mary shakes her head, laughing and walks off.

MARK (CONT'D)
Telling you guys, stint up there,

say. I forgot to give you this.
She hands him the African violet. He puts it down.

Nothing. I left a note. All that

I told him we were in love.

Mark looks as if he’s been shot.

Why? Why mess everything up when it

Her teeth sink into her own flesh. Deep. Blood streams across
the back of her hand. Laura stares straight ahead. She
doesn’t wince. Doesn’t cry out. Just bites down as hard as
she possibly can. Harder. She opens her jaws and her mouth
and teeth are covered with blood.

She looks down at her hand. A deep semicircle bite mark pumps
blood between her fingers onto the tiles.

She wipes it across the shower wall. Staring into space.

Laura slips in, shutting the door behind her.

Mark's office is the same as it ever was-- more man-cave than

Mark with the Endeavor crew-- Laura picks up the picture of

the crew. She runs her finger across it.

She goes through Mark's drawers but doesn't find much more
than a few Playboys and a giant tub of cheese puffs.

Laura wakes up Mark's computer. Laura eats a few cheese puffs
as she leans in, pecking at a few keys. She yanks opens the
desk drawer. Mark's passwords are written on a Post-It taped
to the side of the drawer. She logs in. Something catches her
eye: an email, sent from Mark.

Hey, space girl --

Laura stops. She checks the address-- ErinHawley@nasa.gov.

Erin’s shirt. She leans into him. In the distance, we see his
ex wife and kids preparing the grill.

MARK (V.O.)
Can’t wait for our weekend away.
You’re gonna love Orlando. There’s
this place I know. Can’t get a
reservation. I know a guy.

CUT TO:
EXT. CLEAR LAKE PARK. HOUSTON, TX - NIGHT

Erin and Mark lay in the bed of Mark’s truck with blankets
and pillows. They look up at the stars.

ERIN (V.O.)
I’ll be on flight UA1946. There’s a
two hour layover in Atlanta --
gross -- Gets in at six in the
morning. I cannot wait to see you.

CUT TO:
INT. MARK’S OFFICE. JOHNSON SPACE CENTER -— CONTINUOUS

Laura scribbles down UA1946. And 4.30am. She clicks email
after email, until finally:

MARK (V.O.)
Erin I never felt this way my whole
life. Since being up here I feel
like I have a whole planet of love
I want to give you. I want to make
you feel as wild and free as you
make me feel every second we’re
together. Love your Spaceboy.

Laura looks up from the screen. No reaction. No histrionics.
Nothing. Flat. Emotionless. Numb.

INT. LIVING ROOM. NANA’S APARTMENT — EVENING

Dozens of pieces of paper are arranged around the room. On
the floor. On furniture. Emails. Printed out. Wrinkled from
so much handling. The broken African violet from Mark's
trash, it’s there too, like the sun in her solar system.

LAURA PACES. A combination of very animated and oddly calm.
Moving fast. But her expression remains utterly flat.

She stops her pacing at the kitchen counter and unscrews a
vodka bottle. Pours one. Drinks it. Pours another.

LAURA

She knocks the second back and winces.

LAURA (CONT'D)
Positioned to ON. Positioned to on.

ANGLE ON THE DESK

We see an ENVELOPE of CASH. Next to it is a CAN OF MACE. And
something else -- the .38 SPECIAL, fully loaded.

LAURA

checks her heartrate with two fingers and the second sweep of
her watch.

LAURA (CONT'D)
Positioned to on.

She picks up the bottle of pills and shakes it rhythmically.
There should be enough to get her there.

Laura goes over to her wall, where she’s pinned ROAD MAPS OF
THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES.

ANGLE ON THE WALL

There are ROUTES drawn on the MAP. First, a flight path in
red Houston to Orlando, with a layover in Atlanta.

“Travel time: 756 minutes. ETA: 08:32"

-- a bumper pack of diet sodas --

-- 2 bags of Twinkies --

-- a length of rubber surgical tubing --

Chewing her lips, antsy. She takes out her pill bottle, pops

two pills.

CLERK
Paper or plastic?
LAURA
What?
CLERK
The bag. You want paper or plastic?
LAURA
Plastic. No, paper. No -- wait --

what’s the tensile strength of both
bags, approximately?

The clerk stares at her.

LAURA (CONT'D)
The yield. Have they been stress
tested? Maybe double bag the paper.
Or -- wait -- this it -- paper
inside plastic. Or -- shit, shit.
I‘1l just -- throw it in the cart.
Everything. Come on, get the lead
out.

CUT TO:
EXT. TARGET. HOUSTON, TX - DAY

Laura tosses her things into the back of her SUV and slams
the door shut. She hurries to the driver’s side.

Inside, she tears open the Depends package. She struggles to
strip off her pants, to pull on a pair.

There’s is nothing irrational to this in her mind. She has a
job to do -- drive 800 miles in the fastest time possible. At
80 miles an hour, she can do it in 10 hours. Erin’s flight
lands in 10 hours and 20 minutes.

Laura can’t afford to take a bathroom break.

She gets the diaper on, muscles her pants back on, leaving
them unzipped, unbuttoned, starting the car.

CUT TO:
INT. LAURA’S SUV (TRAVELING) RURAL LOUISIANA - LATER
MUSIC BLASTS. Laura smokes cigarettes and stares to the
horizon. Eyes wide. Eating highway. Nothing can stop her.

Nothing can get in her way, until --

-- sirens flash.
101.

Laura sees in her rearview: a patrol car signaling pull over.
CUT TO:
EXT. HIGHWAY. RURAL LOUISIANA - CONTINUOUS
Laura at the side of the highway. The POLICE OFFICER, hefty
and drowsy, ambles over. When the officer finally reaches the
SUV Laura has the window down offering her best smile.
LAURA
Sorry about that officer. Lost in
my thoughts, I guess.

POLICE OFFICER
Licence, registration.

Laura reaches for the glove compartment, opening it --
-- revealing the handgun --

-- having forgotten it was there, Laura scrambles to knock
gun out of the glove box and under the passenger seat.

Holding her breath, she turns back to the officer, who is
looking down the highway. She hands him her paperwork.

POLICE OFFICER (CONT'D)
So. We all in some type of hurry?

LAURA
Little bit.

The Police Officer spits, taking his time, proving a point.
He’s got no where to be--

POLICE OFFICER
Navy flyer, huh?

LAURA
Yes, sir.

The Officer looks at her over his sunglasses.

POLICE OFFICER
You don’t sir me, Commander. Petty
Officer, First Class, USS Nimitz.
Iraq. Two tours. Where’d you serve?

LAURA
Low Earth Orbit.

POLICE OFFICER
How’s that?
102.

LAURA
I’m an astronaut.

POLICE OFFICER
For real? What’s it like up there?

LAURA
Only place where anything makes
sense.

POLICE OFFICER
I hear that.

He hands back Laura’s licence and registration.
POLICE OFFICER (CONT'D)

Take it a little easier, Commander.
This ain’t no spaceship.

LAURA
I surely will.

Laura drives with the intent expression of the opening scene.

LAURA
Eight hours add 74 minutes, with 4
minute stop for fuel -- OK. Good.

The benefit of all mankind.
She drives.

LAURA (CONT'D)
For the benefit.

Suddenly looks like she might cry. Gets it back. No tears.

LAURA (CONT'D)
For mankind.

She nods. Absolutely certain.

LAURA (CONT'D)
For all mankind. For the benefit of
ALL MANKIND.
CUT TO:
EXT. ORLANDO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - HOUR BEFORE DAWN
It’s drizzling outside. Laura, now wrapped in a giant TRENCH
COAT, and wearing a dark WIG, enters the ARRIVALS TERMINAL.
She couldn’t look crazier.
CUT TO:
INT. ORLANDO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - CONTINUOUS

Laura walks through the empty airport. She pulls at her
trench coat, tightening it as if it were a suit of armor.

Nearby, an AIRPORT JANITOR vacuums the loudly patterned
carpet. Laura walks up and taps the man on the shoulder--

-- startling him half to death. Pulls an earbud from his ear.

LAURA
Baggage from the Houston flight?

AIRPORT JANITOR
Uh, I’m not sure. Over there maybe?

The Janitor points to a crowd beside a luggage carousel.

LAURA
Thank you, sir.

Laura heads for the carousel. The Janitor watches her go, an
eyebrow cocked at her bizarre getup. He shrugs and goes back
to his vacuuming. This is Florida after all. He’s seen worse.

CUT TO:

INT. BAGGAGE CAROUSEL. ORLANDO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT -
MOMENTS LATER

ERIN waits beside the baggage carousel, yoga stretching.
Even after a red eye, Erin is rested and put together.

-- which, can not be said for Laura as she peeks out from
behind a nearby column, spotting Erin. Laura observes. Hands

shoved deep into the pockets of her trench coat.

Erin senses something, someone, and turns her head just as--
104.

-- Laura steps behind the pillar. It’s a close call but --
-- BEEP BEEP BEEP --

With a heavy lurch, the conveyor starts. Erin spots her bag --
a bright red suitcase-- grabs it and starts for the exit.

Head down, Laura steps from behind the column and walks after
Erin, reaching in a trash can and pulls out a newspaper.

CUT TO:
EXT. ORLANDO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - CONTINUOUS

Laura’s pretending to read the newspaper as she follows Erin.
They make their way past a line of taxis and shuttles.

CUT TO:
INT. PARKING GARAGE STAIRS - CONTINUOUS
Erin climbs stairs. Hearing footsteps behind her, she stops.
The footsteps stop, too.

Erin waits for a suspicious second but there’s no sign of
anyone in the garage or stairway. She continues on.

CUT TO:
INT. PARKING GARAGE - GARAGE

Erin wheels her suitcase in the darkened parking garage,
hurrying now. She looks over her shoulder to see --

-- A figure following her. Forty feet back, looking downward,
her wig pulled low to cover her face--

-- Erin speeds up. Glancing over her shoulder.
-- The mysterious figure behind her also speeds up.

-- Erin is getting really afraid now. Tripping over herself
to get up a ramp she closes on her car turning a corner:

-- Erin takes off at a full sprint, her bag bumping and
rolling behind her away from the crazy pursuer.

-- But the crazy silhouette doesn’t stop. It launches into
headlong pursuit of its prey. As it lopes, it reaches in the
pocket of its trench coat and removes a pair of bright yellow
DISH WASHING GLOVES. It pulls them on.
105.
ERIN
Stay away from me! Stay away!!!
Erin rushes to her rental car, fumbling with her keys--
-- WHICH SHE DROPS --

ERIN (CONT'D)
Shit! Shit! shit!

-- Erin scrambles to the ground, reaching for her keys. She
grabs them, unlocks the car--

-- haphazardly tosses her suitcase inside--

-- before diving in herself--

-- slamming the door shut and locked.

Erin looks out the window but there is no sign of her
stalker. It’s gone. Vanished. Erin hurries her seat belt on.
Deep breath. Collects herself. She puts the keys in the
ignition and turns the engine--

-- BAM BAM BAM-—

ERIN (CONT'D)
AHHHHHH!!!!

-- a HAND SLAPS THE WINDOW. Yelling:

LAURA
Open the door! Please. Open up.

Erin stops, her eyes squinting in recognition --

ERIN
Laura is that you?--

-- at the sound of her name, LAURA STARTS CRYING. It’s ugly
stuff-- big tears, heaving, the works.

ERIN (CONT'D)
What are you doing? Are you okay?

Laura’s heart is thumping in her ears. The world swims around
her. Her mouth bone dry. Shuts her eyes and tries to focus.

LAURA
Open the door. I beg you. I’m
scared. Someone is out here.
106.

Her terrified eyes pleading. She looks completely convincing.
Erin’s hand goes to the door lock. Laura’s hand goes into the
pocket of the trenchcoat --

LAURA (CONT'D)
Please --

A FLASH

A WHITE GLOVED HAND closes on a tether, two hundred miles
above the earth, as Laura flies in geosynchronous orbit.

LAURA (CONT'D)
Safety tether detached.

BACK TO:
AIRPORT PARKING LOT
Laura pleads.

LAURA (CONT'D)
You have to help me. Please.

ERIN
What’s going on why are you here?

Laura’s hand comes out of the pocket of her coat holding a
her Nana’s .38 Special, hidden behind her leg.

A FLASH
Mark stares into camera. It is the moment he first met Laura.
MARK
(smiles broadly)
Oh, there it is.
IN THE PARKING LOT

Laura is distraught. Concerned, Erin opens her window.

LAURA
What is happening to me?

ERIN
What are you doing here Laura?

Laura's fist tightens. Her finger moves to the trigger.
A FLASH

The DELIVERY ROOM. Laura lays in bed with the TWINS in her
arms. She has just given birth.
107.
She touches their little hands. They look up at her, not
crying, filled with wonder --
IN THE PARKING LOT
Laura's head swims, her eyes blurry.

ERIN (CONT'D)
Are you OK? What’s happened to you?

LAURA
I want. I want. Please. Why can’t
you all just -- see? I -- I’m --
Laura starts to raise the gun -- inch by inch --
ERIN

Laura talk to me? Why are you here?
A FLASH
NANA sips from her coffee cup, alive again.
NANA
So you’re just gonna have to work
harder.
IN THE PARKING LOT

Laura focuses on Erin.

-- the gun’s progress slows, fighting herself for every
inch.

LAURA
I don’t know.

Laura opens her hand. The gun drops from her fingers into
space. Floating away from her weightless in slow motion.

Laura looks down at it impossibly floating at zero G speed
away from her then back at Erin’s confused expression.

A FLASH

RUTH stands in her homemade astronaut costume, the name tag
reading L. Wallace.

RUTH
Ta da.

IN THE PARKING LOT

Erin looks around, fear returning.
108.
ERIN
Laura? This is a teensy bit crazy.

Laura throws her head back and let’s out a guttural howl of
anger and pain as she raises her other hand and --

-- BLASTS ERIN IN THE FACE WITH A CAN OF MACE.
In her eyes a chilling expression of limitless rage and glee.

ERIN (CONT'D)
Aaaaaaargghhh!!! You bitch!

LAURA REACHES THROUGH THE WINDOW AND OPENS THE DOOR --
-- GRABS ERIN BY THE HAIR, TRYING TO PULL HER FROM THE CAR--
-- BUT THE SEAT BELT SAVES HER. SHE’S STUCK. THEY STRUGGLE
FOR A FEW MOMENTS WITH HER HALF IN AND HALF OUT OF THE CAR.
KICKING AND PUNCHING AND FIGHTING.

CUT TO:

Laura's screaming twin sons fight on her kitchen floor,
wrapped up in a tangle of pulled hair and kicked shins.

BACK TO:
SUDDENLY LAURA SEEMS COMPLETLEY AWARE OF HER BEHAVIOUR
She releases her two big handfuls of Erin’s hair.

LAURA
Oh my god. I’m sorry.

Erin kicks her hard away. AND SHE SLAMS A FOOT ON THE GAS--
-- CRUNCHHH--

-- her car lurches forward, directly into the bumper of the
car parked opposite--

-- Laura lies on the gravel, the mace in her gloved hand,
stunned at what she’s done. Breathing. Eyes wide and wild.

-- BEEP BEEP BEEP--

-- Erin crashes more cars, setting off car alarms. She
reaches out to slam the door, shifts into drive and takes off

-- SCREEEETCH--

-- the side of the car scraping along the concrete wall as
Erin drives like a (blind) bat out of hell.

Laura sinks to her knees. She looks up at the sky.

Laura’s 2-pound drilling hammer sits on a metal table, where
a beefy man, DETECTIVE LOPEZ, takes evidence pictures.

Lopez replaces the hammer with Laura’s wig. He snaps a new

lengths, the mace, a knackered African violet, $585 in cash,
an 8-inch Gerber folding hunting knife --

Another detective enters. Picks up the knife, whistling.

DETECTIVE LOPEZ

Laura is turned to the left, for a series of mug shots.
DETECTIVE LOPEZ (0.S.)

Said that’s how they did it in
space. Said she’s an astronaut.

DETECTIVE CAIN

Laura turns towards the camera, brow furrowed in
embarrassment. She looks terrible. Like a caught kid.

Laura’s hair is a stringy mess, tear-smeared make-up streaks
her cheeks, even that can’t cover the circles under her eyes--

A mugshot of total confusion and shame.

Takes the stairs two at_a time. Wild-eyed. Moving as fast as
