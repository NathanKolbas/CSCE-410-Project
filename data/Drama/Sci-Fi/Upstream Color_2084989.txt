INT. HATCHBACK - DUSK

In the backseat lies TWO FULL TRASHBAGS open enough to see
the contents: PAPER RINGS LINKED IN A LONG CHAIN. On each
sheet of folded paper we can make out HANDWRITING.

The wind jostles them as the car speeds down the road.

EXT. ALLEY/ RECYCLING BIN - NEXT - DUSK
EVAN (30) carries the bags from his car to the bin.

One goes in easy. The other TEARS so he has to scoop up the
tangled paper chain by hand. It clumps like intestines.

LUCAS and PETER, both 12, bike down the alley. Lucas heads
toward Evan who’s getting back in the car. Peter hesitates:

PETER
What are you doing? Lucas.

Peter listens from a distance. Lucas is at the car window:

LUCAS
When can we come over? You know.
Come ove-

EVAN
Yeah, I get it. Couple weeks. We’1l
see.

Peter doesn’t get it. The hatchback takes off.

INT. PLANT NURSERY - DAY

Evan scans through the aisles, hunting for a certain flower.
He rubs his fingers on the GREEN LEAF of one. Not it.
Another shows more promise, an ORCHID. He scrapes a leaf
wollen KNIFE, producing a TURQUOISE POWDER, fine like

He grabs a handful of the plant’s soil and sifts through it.
Then another handful until he finds a TINY WHITE INCHWORM.

CUT TO:

He buys four of the potted orchids at the checkout.
Revision 1 2.

EXT. EVAN’S HOUSE/ BACK YARD - DUSK

He pulls the last of the plants from its pot, shakes the
dirt off the roots, and throws it in a fire.

He dumps the pot soil onto a SIFTER and starts shaking it,
leaving behind rocks, twigs, and SEVERAL WHITE INCHWORMS.
INT. EVAN’S HOUSE/ BACK ROOM - NEXT - DUSK

TwO EMPTY GLASS JARS sit on the desk. One has a HAPPY FACE
sticker, the other a FROWN with X’s for eyes.

Evan scans over the sifter, picking up worm after worm.
One SQUIRMS in his palm. He throws it in the happy jar.
Another lies STILL. Dead. It goes in the frown jar.

Behind him, an OLD MAN, GILL plays ONLINE POKER.

EXT. EVAN’S HOUSE/ BACK PORCH - NIGHT

Peter cautiously bikes in to see Lucas amusing a group of
TEENAGERS. He’s positioning an older boy, MONTY, in the
middle of the porch then gets him to down a shot of BLACK
LIQUID.

Lucas pours himself a shot from his TRAVEL MUG, downs it,
shakes out his arms, and puts his hands over Monty’s eyes:

LUCAS
Close ’em. Close ya eyes. Just
trust.
Monty does. Lucas stands at his side and prepares.

Lucas slowly raises his right hand, swirls his index finger.
Monty’s right hand MIMICS the motion in perfect unison.

Lucas gets more creative, making hand gestures, using both
arms. Monty, eyes closed, instantly matches move for move.
He’s a PUPPET. Lucas gestures to the others:

LUCAS (cont’d)
Go ahead. Throw it up. Throw it.

Someone throws a BALL at Monty who smacks it down,
controlled by Lucas. Then a STICK, EMPTY CAN, etc.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED: Revision 1 3.

Lucas stands facing Monty so that their every move is a
mirror opposite (not mirrored, get it?). They poke each
other’s shoulders, play-smack each other’s face, like an
extremely complex game of patty cake.

Lucas stops when he sees Peter.

LUCAS (cont’d)
Wait, wait. Peter. Peter! Come
here! Peter’s left-handed. He’s a
lefty.

INT. EVAN’S HOUSE/ BACK ROOM - NEXT - NIGHT

Evan sits back, allowing Lucas to run the process at the
desk and show off for Peter. He grabs a live inchworm from
the DOZEN in the happy jar and references the 100 dead ones
in the frown jar:

LUCAS
See how many you gotta go through
to get a good one?

He puts it on a COCKTAIL STRAINER and pours PEPSI over the
worm, letting it collect in a shot glass for Peter. Lucas
moves the worm and strainer to his own mug while...

LUCAS (cont’d)
Pete’s a bit of a germaphobe so let
me get mine going and I’1l show
there’s nothing-

Peter’s not going to be pushed so he just downs it fast.

Lucas looks up, surprised. He doesn’t see the worm fall
THROUGH the strainer into his mug. Behind them, Gill does:

GILL
Hey, boy! Watch that.

LUCAS
Yeah, I got it. I know. See, I
know. Nobody wants that. Come here
little guy.

EVAN
No, no. Just throw-

LUCAS
No, I know. Throw this batch out.
That’s that. I know. See. Start
over.
Revision 1 4.

He pours out the mug, wipes it with a napkin.

EXT. EVAN’S HOUSE/ BACK PORCH - NEXT - NIGHT
Lucas faces Peter. The others watch. Peter’s nervous.

LUCAS
Ready?

PETER
No.

He looks around, embarrassed to be the center of attention.
Lucas throws up a jab. Peter instantly mirrors him with a
jab of his own. Their fists meet. He’s shocked. It’s
involuntary.

Lucas throws random jabs, slaps, and hooks, all met by
Peter, moving in perfect unison. Now he’s enjoying it,
laughing. It doesn’t stop even as they talk and the others
CHEER.

PETER (cont’d)
How are you doing it?

LUCAS
I’m not. You are.

PETER
I’m not. You are.

LUCAS AND PETER
I’m not you are. You’re doing it.
You are.

EXT. NEAR TRAIN BRIDGE - DAWN

Lucas applauds NOELA (11) as she does cartwheels in the
grass.

CUT TO:

They hold each other, leaning against a boulder. She shares
his mug. He whispers something in her ear and...

Without hesitation she walks out on a NARROW WALL of
concrete jutting from the hillside. The fall would be 30
feet. She doesn’t seem to care. Nearby, Peter watches,
getting worried.

He panics, moving to help as she prepares for a cartwheel...

(CONTINUED)
9A

CONTINUED: Revision 1 5.

But when she places the first hand down she suddenly wakes
up to the danger, wobbles, steadies herself. She steps
back...
...and comes right after Lucas, violently SLAPPING at him.
NOELA
The hell’s...wrong...with you!
EXT. CITY MARATHON - DAY

1000 RACERS move through the suburbs. One racer, JEFF,
passes by a man with a DOG on the roadside, BRENT.

JEFF
Watch your dog.

BRENT
What?

JEFF

Get your dog out of the road.
Jeff stops, comes back, dithers, before finally approaching:

JEFF (cont’d)
Where you from? You from here?

BRENT
That’s my house.

Jeff takes off, blowing off the odd feeling he seems to
have. Brent calls after him:

BRENT (cont’d)
Where are you from?

Jeff waves it off, runs away:

JEFF
Nothing. Nowhere.

CUT TO:
KRIS (30, LONG DARK HAIR) runs in a stream of racers.
She slows to a stop, answers her ear bud phone, turns the

opposite way so the race flows around her. Something’s
wrong:

KRIS
Say that again, what? You can see
what? Whose? No, not til Monday.
Whose is it?

EXT. CONSTRUCTION YARD - DAY

AN OTHER-WORLDY CREATURE gallops across like a horse. After
a few feet the movement REPEATS: it’s a VIDEO CLIP
playing...

INT. VISUAL PRODUCTION BUILDING - DAY

.»..0N a monitor in front of Kris, now in OFFICE DRESS. She’s
in one cubicle of many, on the phone:

KRIS (ON PHONE)
You can see his foot. A grip,
gaffer, I don’t know, somebody’s
foot, a shadow. Right but if I can
see it they’re going to see it too.
Ok I’m going to ask five people
around me if they notice and if
one-

CUT TO:
ROTH (40) leans against her cubicle wall.

ROTH
Cut them loose. Hire another team.
You can’t keep having the same
conversation with them. what do you
think?

She ponders.

KRIS
I think they were the best of the
lot and the rest aren’t great...and
I can’t keep having the same
conversation with them.

INT. DOWNTOWN/ RESTAURANT - NEXT - DAY

She finishes a salad at the bar, scanning 12 INDEX CARDS
fanned out in front of her. Each card lists a different
visual effects house, number of employees, etc. and is
paper-clipped to ARTWORK depicting the creature we saw on
her monitor.

CUT TO:
KRIS (ON PHONE)
It has been a while- I’m sorry
about that, but you’re work is just
amazing. When we saw your take on
it everyone knew instantly we found
the right place. I do have a couple
questions-
INT. EVAN’S HOUSE/ BACK ROOM - DUSK
Evan sets aside TWO CAPSULES from a TYLENOL bottle...
.carefully opens one, empties the medicine...
.places an inchworm inside, recloses the halves...
-marks a TINY DOT on the capsule with a pen.

He holds the tampered and untampered capsules up to the
light, comparing them before they both go in a SMALL BAGGY.

WOMAN (OFF SCREEN)
What is it?
INT. DOWNTOWN/ NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT

Sitting in a back booth, he’s showing her the baggy under
the table discreetly. He’s coy, flirting. She is too.

WOMAN
You have more?

EVAN
One for me. One for you.

WOMAN
My friends though.

This disappoints him, but he doesn’t let her see.
Recovering:

EVAN
When are they coming?

She lazily points across the room. They’re already there.

EVAN (cont’d)
Let me check if I can get more.

He scoots out of the booth. She didn’t hear him.

WOMAN
What? Where are you going?

He’s done with her so why not...
EVAN
You got wine breath. Go brush your
teeth.
EXT. DOWNTOWN/ SIDEWALK - NEXT - NIGHT

He walks through the crowd, scanning faces, hunting.

EXT. DOWNTOWN/ MINI-MART - NEXT - NIGHT

Leaning against the wall, he hangs the baggy just outside
his jean pocket, trying to get the attention of a man ina
SUIT.

Suit ignores him. Evan shakes it off, dismayed. He leaves.

EXT. DOWNTOWN/ STREET - NEXT - NIGHT

He grabs a BROWN GROCERY SACK from his car, tests out a
TASER, and walks off.

INT. DOWNTOWN/ RESTAURANT - NEXT - NIGHT

We follow Kris to a back hallway where the restrooms are.
She tries the women’s, but it’s locked. She waits, checks
her phone, flicks through messages. Beyond her...

...Evan waits outside the men’s.
He approaches with his phone out to show her:

EVAN
Are you getting a signal in here?
Got a new phone and I can’t tell if
it’s me or-

She looks over, but it doesn’t matter because now he’s close
enough to jam a TASER under her ribs. She seizes up and
collapses against the wall.

In one practiced move he puts the taser away and cradles her
in one arm. She looks like any other drunk girl.
19

Revision 1 9.

EXT. DOWNTOWN/ ALLEYWAY BEHIND RESTAURANT - NEXT - NIGHT
The exit door BANGS OPEN.

He lays her on the pavement. She’s gasping for breath, not
able to make a sound.

He retrieves the GROCERY SACK from behind a dumpster and
sits on her chest as he unpacks a RESUSCITATOR.

He places it over her mouth and twists the valve. WATER
starts to drip. He squeezes the resuscitator bag that we now
see is full of liquid. It flows into her, forcing her to
swallow. For an instant we see an INCHWORM in the tube
before it disappears into her mouth.

She swallows one last time. He takes the device away,
allowing her to breathe. He stands up like he’s just roped a
calf.

She gasps, crawling to her knees. She stumbles to her feet,
trying to escape down the alley.

He grabs her PURSE from the ground and slowly follows,
keeping his distance, observing. A subtle transformation
takes place:

Her panic ebbs until she is walking casually, unsure of her
own motivation. She suddenly veers off, but Evan corrects
her:

EVAN
No no. Come on. This way.

She obeys. By the time they reach the heavy foot traffic on
the main street, she is more like a companion than victim.

EVAN
Turn left here.

She does. They enter the thick congestion of people.

EVAN (cont’d)
Hold onto my belt. Take your purse.

She does. He leads. They are just another couple on a date.

Revision 1 10.

INT. KRIS’ CAR - NEXT - NIGHT

Evan rides in the back seat, scanning Kris’ house as they
pull into the long driveway.

INT. KRIS’ HOUSE/ OFFICE - NEXT - NIGHT

At the desk Evan thumbs through bills, financial statements,
etc. He sets aside blank "BALANCE TRANSFER CHECKS".

He opens her checkbook to see the balance: "$5189.23".

He checks his watch, thinks. He pulls a PAPERBACK copy of
"WALDEN" from his back pocket, rests it on the desk.

He taps the cover while scanning the room.

INT. KRIS’ HOUSE/ HALLWAY CLOSET - NEXT - NIGHT
He pulls out various BOARD GAMES, looking for something.

He finds a case of POKER CHIPS, tucks it under his arm.

INT. KRIS’ HOUSE/ FOYER - NEXT - NIGHT

KRIS’ BARE FEET are within ONE WHITE TILE of the tiled
floor.

She stands, relaxed, almost nodding off against the wall.

Evan SNAPS his fingers:

EVAN
No no. Stay awake. You feel
refreshed.

KRIS

Is there food?

EVAN
All the food is poisoned. You’re
throat is parched. Go to the
kitchen. Make a pitcher of ice
water. Bring a small glass.

She looks to the kitchen and then to her feet, confused.

EVAN
You can leave the tile. The rest of
the floor will support your weight
now.
23

Revision 1 11.

INT. KRIS’ HOUSE/ LIVING ROOM - NEXT - NIGHT
The PITCHER and GLASS rest on the table. Kris sits.

EVAN
I have to apologize. I was born
with a disfigurement where my head
is made of the same material as the
sun. It makes it impossible for you
to look directly at me. It has
always been this way.

Kris is hit with a FLOOD OF LIGHT. She squints, turns away.
Evan’s head is a BRIGHT LIGHT, illuminating the room.
He pours a tiny amount of water into the glass.

EVAN (cont’d)
The water before you is somehow
special. When you drink it you feel
revived and full of energy. It is
better than anything you have ever
tasted. Take a drink now.

She does, surprised at how good it is. He pours again.

EVAN
There are two approaching armies:
hunger and fatigue. But a great
wall keeps them at bay. The wall
extends to the sky and will stay up
until I say otherwise. Each drink
is better than the last, leaving
you with a desire to have one more.
Take a drink now.

She does, immediately eyeing the pitcher, wanting more.
EVAN (cont’d)
The next drink must be earned and
I’m going to tell you how. Focus
closely on my instructions. I will
ask you to repeat them from memory.
INT. KRIS’ HOUSE/ BEDROOM - DAWN
Evan sleeps alone in Kris’ bed. His phone alarm BEEPS.

He wakes.

CUT TO:
25

26

Revision 1 12.

He plays a few hands of POKER on his phone.

INT. KRIS’ HOUSE/ KITCHEN - NEXT - DAY

He scans over a tray of MULTI-COLORED ESPRESSO CAPSULES,
trying to pick one.

He tries to figure out how to get a capsule into the
machine.

ESPRESSO pours into a cup. We hear Kris in the next room...

INT. KRIS’ HOUSE/ LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS - DAY
She is organizing the poker chips in stacks of 10:

KRIS
Ten chip. Ten chip. Eight, nine,
ten chip. Three, four, and six, ten
chip...

She does a quick count of the stacks with her finger.

Satisfied, she grabs a nearby SHEET OF PAPER full of her
HANDWRITING. She folds it over and adds it as another "link"
in the CHAIN OF PAPER RINGS she has been constructing all
night. She uses a glue stick and then counts while she holds
it tight:
KRIS (cont’d)

One one thousand, two one thousand,

three one thousand, four and five

and stick...
She lets go of the paper, watching to make sure it sticks.

It does so she gets her treat, filling the glass precisely
to a MARKER LINE drawn by hand. It’s barely a sip.

She downs the drink and takes a moment to enjoy it before
realizing she wants another. She gets back to work.

CUT TO:
Evan enters with his coffee and a disconnected TELEPHONE.
Kris finishes transcribing a page from "WALDEN" to a sheet

of blank paper and immediately starts stacking chips. First
a line of single chips, then two:

Revision 1 13.

KRIS (cont’d)
One chip, one chip, one chip, one,
one, one, one chip, one, one, one
chip, two chip, two chip, two, one
and two chip...

EVAN
The water has lost its appeal. It
doesn’t seem as enticing as before.
You have no craving for it.

She continues her work, but slowly the passion for it goes
missing as if she is questioning it for the first time.

He places

the telephone RECEIVER to his ear as a prop:

EVAN
Kris, I’ve just got a call. It’s
your mother. She says she’s been
taken by several men.

KRIS
Oh no.

EVAN
She says they won’t let her go
unless you pay them.

KRIS
No. Oh no. Do you have money?

EVAN
No, I don’t. I’m sorry. Can you
think of anything? She sounds
brave, but I think they’re hurting

her.
KRIS
Mom. I have the house.
EVAN
You own the house?
KRIS
Not all of it. But I have...I
could-
EVAN

What’s the equity?
KRIS

Thirty-six thousand. Would that be
enough? And coins.

CONTINUED: Revision 1 14.

EVAN
Coins?
INT. KRIS’ HOUSE/ WALK-IN CLOSET - NEXT - DAY
She sits in front of a WALL PANEL, very upset, crying:

KRIS
I just. Don’t. Feel. Like I should.

EVAN

Do you want me to look away? Would

that make you feel better?

She hesitates. He’s still directly behind her but...

EVAN

I’ve stepped outside. You are

comfortable and secure. You have

taken control. Confident and

empowered.

She opens the panel revealing a HANDGUN, PAPERS, and 3
VELVET CASES.

Evan sees the gun and eyes Kris, but she’s oblivious to it,
only removing the cases before returning the panel.

INT. KRIS’ HOUSE/ BATHROOM - NEXT - DAY

She’s on the toilet after a night of drinking water.

At the counter Evan counts the GOLD COINS in the first case
and then opens the next two cases, also FULL.

INT. KRIS’ HOUSE/ OFFICE - NEXT - DAY

PAPERS slide out of the PRINTER entitled: "APPLICATION FOR
HOME EQUITY LINE OF CREDIT".

INT. KRIS’ HOUSE/ BEDROOM - NEXT - DAY

Evan picks out a WHITE DRESS from Kris’ closet...

Revision 1 15.

INT. KRIS’ HOUSE/ DINING ROOM - NEXT - DAY

Kris wears the dress, makeup done, beautiful. She finishes
filling out the application at the table.

Evan checks it and slides a BALANCE TRANSFER CHECK to her.

EVAN
Five thousand.

She fills it out, writes "$5000.00", signs it.

EVAN
Forty-five hundred.

He slides another check to her. She fills it out.

EVAN (cont’d)
Three thousand.

He slides another.

INT. KRIS’ CAR - NEXT - DAY
She drives. He sits immediately behind her.

EVAN
Weather is beautiful. You feel like
walking a bit so you park a block
away.

EXT. BANK - NEXT - DAY

From the car he watches her go in from a block away.

INT. KRIS’ CAR - NEXT - DAY
She drives while relaying a mental transcript:

KRIS

-I give you back your ID? There we
are. Current balance is at the
bottom. Please allow three to four
business days for availability of
funds. Is there anything else I can
help you with? No, that’s it. Then
thank you very much for stopping in
Miss Fischer and have a great-

EXT. CREDIT UNION - NEXT - DAY

Kris exits and walks toward the car.

INT. KRIS’ CAR - NEXT - DAY
Again, while she drives:

KRIS
Yes ma’am, may I help you? who can
I speak to about a home equity line
of credit? I can help you with
that. My name is Marie. Please have
a seat. I love your broche-

INT. KRIS’ HOUSE/ LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Kris is alone. She’s lost weight. Her eyes are sunken in.
Her busywork has become more elaborate. She CROCHETS with
YARN that alternates between WHITE and RED after some
length:

KRIS
Over and under and through and back
and over and under and through and
around and over and under and
through and back and now you are
red.

She positions herself in front of the RED PIECES in a game
of CHECKERS. After some thought, she plays, jumping a piece.

KRIS (cont’d)
Crown me.

She adds another handwritten page from "Walden" to the chain
and pours a sip of water. The chain is now 20 FEET LONG and
winds throughout the room.

EXT. KRIS’ HOUSE/ BACK PORCH - DAY

Evan listens to voicemail on Kris’ phone while playing more
poker on his.

MAN ON PHONE
Kris, Roth again. I assumed you’ve
been sick and maybe called HR
instead. Um, I don’t know why you
would do that, we need to hear-

He hits "delete". Behind him Kris continues her work.

Revision 1 17.

INT. KRIS’ HOUSE/ KITCHEN - DAY
Evan is making a SANDWICH, slathering CREAM CHEESE.
He suddenly notices Kris is standing behind him holding the
empty pitcher. Still shielding her eyes from him, she’s
staring at the sandwich, salivating.
EVAN
The wall is a mile thick and made
of rock. Nothing can or ever has
gotten through.
She moves on to refill her pitcher, but her eyes linger.
He thinks on this.
CUT TO:

He fills a LARGE POT with ICE.

INT. KRIS’ HOUSE/ DINING ROOM - NEXT - DAY

She’s enjoying a BOWL of ice, blowing over a spoonful,
convinced it is hot. The large pot and ladle are on the
table.

On the wall SHADOWS of tree leaves dance. She laughs at them
likes she’s watching a sitcom. Which she is.

INT. KRIS’ CAR - DAY

Evan waits in the backseat as Kris approaches from the bank.

She gets behind the wheel, drops an ENVELOPE on the next
seat.

As they drive off he grabs the envelope, checks the CASH
inside, and files it with other envelopes in a SHOEBOX.
INT. KRIS’ HOUSE/ LIVING ROOM - DAY

Kris does her busywork. Evan packs the coins in the
shoebox...

...puts WALDEN back in his pocket...
...grabs the telephone and pitcher...

...dumps the ice water in the sink...

...watches Kris work for one last moment before...
EVAN
Kris, the wall has crumbled, fallen
down.
Her works slows. She sits back.
While Evan begins packing the LONG CHAIN OF PAPER RINGS into
TRASH BAGS she stands, heading to the kitchen.
INT. KRIS’ HOUSE/ KITCHEN - NEXT - DAY
She sits on the floor eating from the refrigerator with the
doors wide open. She’s too busy to notice Evan exit through
the front door with the trash bags and shoebox.
CUT TO:
She’s gone. The refrigerator contents have been ransacked
and the doors left open.
INT. KRIS’ HOUSE/ BEDROOM - NEXT - DAY
She’s in deep sleep, JAM and BITS OF FOOD caked on her
mouth.
INT. BLOODSTREAM
On a macro scale we see representations of chemistry,
biology, branching, growth. SLENDER TUBULES glide past each
other.

INT. KRIS’ HOUSE/ BEDROOM - NIGHT

Still asleep, Kris’ arm UNFURLS and twists seemingly under
its own control until it extends out to the edge of the bed.

One at a time her legs reach out to full extension.

On her left calf something that looks like a LARGE VEIN
rises against the inside of the skin and ELONGATES toward
her foot.

The same happens on her left forearm.

Her eyes open slowly. Unaware, she turns to her right arm...

...to see the LONG WORM rise against the skin.

Revision 1 19.

INT. KRIS’ HOUSE/ KITCHEN - NEXT - NIGHT

Sitting on the floor against the counter Kris frantically
tries to push the worm along her ankle with her hand. With
the other hand she reaches up to a drawer and withdraws a
KNIFE.

She summons bravery and then CUTS into her leg. She’s able
to pull out the end of the worm, but the more she pulls the
more agonizing the pain.

With 6 inches of worm in her grip she slices off its end.
Immediately, we hear a HIGH-PITCHED TONE. She passes out.

DAY
She’s still lying in the same spot. Unconscious.
NIGHT
She slowly comes to.

CUT TO:
She sits at the refrigerator, EATING fast, DRINKING water.
She thinks to examine her ankle and sees...

The wound is SCABBED OVER.

EXT. TRUCK BED - DUSK
10 SPEAKERS lay in the bed as the truck heads toward the
CITY on a rural road.
EXT. EMPTY FIELD/ OUTSKIRTS - DUSK
Against the far off CITYSCAPE we isolate a TRUCK. Extending
up from the cab on a POLE is a GANG OF LIGHTS that suddenly
flips on, lighting the surroundings like a bioluminescent
lure.

CUT TO:
Alone, WESLEY (50) unloads 10 LARGE SPEAKERS from his truck.

He lays them face down on the ground in a group.

He hits "play" on a TAPE PLAYER next to preamps in the truck
bed. GRUMBLING BASS like womb noise plays into the ground.

He walks away from the setup, a FOLDING CHAIR under his arm.

49

CONTINUED: Revision 1 20.

NIGHT
EARTHWORMS writhe in the mud.
Far away Wesley sits in his chair taking notes under a book
light. A VIDEO on his phone shows a CELLIST auditioning in
an empty rehearsal hall. After a few bars...
He skips to another clip, an OBOIST:
OBOIST (IN VIDEO)

My name is Kevin Anderson. I’1l be

playing Ilaiyaraja’s score from

Dalapathi in G.
3 seconds in, Wesley skips to a FRENCH HORN, TRUMPET, etc.
HEADLIGHTS approach on the road. He leans to his telescope:

The car stops. Kris steps out in a nightgown, moving into
the field toward the speakers.

Wesley packs up.

Kris walks almost trancelike, stopping once before
continuing. Nearby, more worms writhe on the ground. Dark
everywhere.

She gets to the speakers. The bass switches off suddenly.
The SILENCE wakes her.

Wesley hits the truck headlights and moves to her.

She raises her arms, showing him CUTS on all her
extremities.

KRIS
It won’t come out.

WESLEY
No. Not like that.
INT. LIVESTOCK BUILDING/ EXAM ROOM - NEXT - NIGHT
Kris stands next to a STEEL PLATFORM, a scale for weighing
livestock. Fluorescents hum while she looks around

nervously.

Wesley calibrates the scale then...

(CONTINUED)
50

CONTINUED: Revision 1 21.

WESLEY
Ok, go ahead and step on.

She does. He marks her weight on a CLIPBOARD.

INT. LIVESTOCK BUILDING/ WHITE ROOM - NEXT - NIGHT

She sits on a COT downing a tall glass of a MILKY MIXTURE.
She eyes Wesley who is marking up the clipboard.

WESLEY
What did you weigh...before the
growth?

KRIS

One fifteen. Maybe. Why?

All business, he puts another full glass of the mixture in
front of her. She grabs it and prepares to drink.

KRIS
Will you say why?

WESLEY
It’s fine. This guy’s 11 pounds.

KRIS
Is that good?

Wesley silently continues writing.

KRIS,
How long does it take?

He pours another glass to a precise level for her.

KRIS (cont’d)
This’11 kill it?

He makes the mistake of looking at her and melts a bit:
WESLEY
I can answer all your questions
after. Right now there’s no point
in telling you. You won’t remember.

KRIS
Where did it come from?

Nothing.

No. No that won’t. That’s going to
make you very sick. We’re making
your body a place he doesn’t want
to be. Eleven pounds makes him
thirty feet long so it’1ll take
around three and a half days.

He closes his clipboard, set to leave. She’s scared.
WESLEY

It doesn’t come from anywhere. You

people just show up. I’m sure you

think you’re awake. You’re not

awake.
INT. LIVESTOCK BUILDING/ EXAM ROOM - NIGHT
Wesley puts in EARPLUGS to muffle Kris’ SCREAMS of agony
coming from down the hall. He ties TWO RAW BEEF STEAKS
together with GAUZE.
INT. LIVESTOCK BUILDING/ WHITE ROOM - NEXT - NIGHT
Wesley searches Kris’ extremities: left arm, left leg, right
arm, right leg. That’s where he finds the NUB of the worm’s
head peeking out. He wraps the layers of beef over it.
He pulls the cot to the other side of the room for better
access, nearly deaf to her screams.
INT. LIVESTOCK BUILDING/ EXAM ROOM - MORNING

Wesley has prepped an area on the belly of an unconscious
PIG for surgery. He washes it with iodine.

He begins to cut out a SQUARE SEGMENT with a scalpel.

INT. LIVESTOCK BUILDING/ WHITE ROOM - NEXT - MORNING

He checks between the steaks to see the worm has traveled
through the first and entered the second.

He inserts a WOODEN DOWEL under the worm and manages to loop

it a few times. He turns the dowel, pulling more of the worm
from Kris. She screams.

CONTINUED: Revision 1 23.

He wheels the pig into the room on a gurney, positioned next
to Kris’ leg.

He affixes the second steak, worm still embedded, to the
square wound on the pig.

NIGHT

Kris moans, passed out from exhaustion. Wesley pours more
mixture, wakes her.

She pushes it away, screaming:

KRIS
NO! NO!

She looks toward the pig and goes quiet. After some thought
she downs the poison. She has seen:

The setup is orderly and running well. The worm goes from
her leg, around the dowel (now supported on a stand) a few
times, and then disappears into the pig.

DAY

Wesley turns the dowel for the last time, removing the last
part of worm from Kris.

He wheels the pig out of the room. 12 inches of worm still
protrudes from its wound.
INT. LIVESTOCK BUILDING/ EXAM ROOM - DAY

Reading from his notes he adds a line to a page of names and
serial numbers: "KRIS FISCHER 20110802-Kris"

On a SMALL TAG he copies the serial number: "20110802-Kris"
He PIERCES the pig’s ear with the tag. By now the worm has
crawled further in with only a few inches now left outside.
EXT. PIGPEN - DAY

The pig is released into the pen passing others with similar
ear tags and first names: "Robert" "Luis" "Paula" etc.

The pen holds 50 PIGS. Beyond it is Wesley’s FARMHOUSE.

EXT. KRIS’ HOUSE - DAY

Kris calmly walks to the front entrance and opens the door.

INT. KRIS’ HOUSE - NEXT - DAY

We follow as she passes through the living room, the
kitchen, her bedroom. She doesn’t seem to notice the TENS OF
PEOPLE standing idle in every room.

She begins to remove her nightgown when she stops, puzzled.
She calmly steps back to the kitchen to see everyone, but
before she can make sense of it...

EXT. RURAL ROAD NEAR REFINERY - DAY

Kris wakes in her car. She has been placed behind the wheel.

The car is parked just off the road. 4 STRIPED TOWERS of an
oil refinery lie in the distance.

For a moment she is frozen in terror, eyes wide. She
suddenly takes a huge breath, waking to her surroundings.

She nervously checks the backseat, the glove box, the
floorboard, looking for any clue to how she got here.

A moment of thought leads her to a greater fear: she lifts
her nightgown and puts a hand in her underwear. She inspects
her fingers but nothing is confirmed either way.

EXT. POLICE STATION - NEXT - DAY

She drives into the parking lot...

...turns off the ignition, about to open the car door but...

Her hand rests on the HANDLE. She scans people: COPS,
VICTIMS, MEN IN HANDCUFFS. She’s hesitating.

She starts up the ignition and backs out.

EXT. KRIS’ HOUSE - NEXT - DAY

She pulls into the driveway, looking for anything
suspicious.

She opens the front door and pushes it WIDE OPEN.

After checking around corners she quickly takes a few steps
in, grabs her CELLPHONE, and retreats back outside.

She dials 911 then lets her thumb hover over the CALL
button.

She wields this as a weapon and enters the house.

INT. KRIS’ HOUSE - NEXT - DAY

She stands in each room, studying it. The OFFICE...
LIVING ROOM...
» HALLWAY...
. BEDROOM...

...KITCHEN. She crouches near the DRIED BLOOD on the floor.
The KNIFE lies next to it. She rubs her wrist.

CUT TO:
She MOPS and cleans the kitchen.

INT. KRIS’ HOUSE/ BATHROOM - NEXT - DAY

Kris showers.

INT. KRIS’ HOUSE/ LIVING ROOM - NEXT - DAY
DRESSED for work, PURSE ready, COAT on. She sits on the
couch gathering thoughts, contemplating.
EXT. VISUAL PRODUCTION BUILDING - NEXT - DAY
She walks with determination through the parking lot toward
the front entrance.
INT. VISUAL PRODUCTION BUILDING/ OFFICE - NEXT - DAY
Kris sits before a female MANAGER.
MANAGER

Because I spoke to Amy and she
didn’t remember talking to-

KRIS

I already said it was voicemail. I

left a voice- where is Roth? Today.

Why isn’t he telling me himself?
MANAGER

Well he couldn’t be here but that’s

not...

Kris notices a SECURITY GUARD enter and stand nearby.

KRIS

I. Had. The flu. I had a hundred
and six temperature!

EXT. VISUAL PRODUCTION BUILDING - NEXT - DAY

She walks to her car, crying and carrying PICTURE FRAMES, a
MUG, etc. The guard stays behind her.

INT. GROCERY STORE - NIGHT

Kris is checking out, running her CARD through the SCANNER.
It’s not working. The CASHIER tries to help but it’s no use.

Frustration mounts. We’re too far away to hear dialogue.

INT. BANK/ INVESTIGATOR’S OFFICE - DAY

Kris waits alone. Her older sister MAGGIE stands just
outside.

MAGGIE (ON CELLPHONE)

Richie, it’s me. If you’re already

on the road I’m sorry, but we’ve

got a problem. It’s Kris.

Everybody’s safe but you need to

call as soon as you can.

CUT TO:

Maggie has joined Kris, both seated, waiting.

MAGGIE
What time do you have to get back?

Kris stares forward, tense.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED: Revision 1 27.

MAGGIE
Kris, what time?

KRIS,
I don’t. I quit.

MAGGIE
You quit your job? When?

KRIS
Few days ago- last week.

MAGGIE
Krissy, why?

KRIS
Because. They’re assholes.

The bank INVESTIGATOR joins them at his desk with PAPERS.
CUT TO:
He’s placed down a WITHDRAWAL SLIP COPY for them to inspect.
KRIS (cont’d)
...that’s not even my- that’s
forged. That’s not my signature.
It’s not.

Maggie scrutinizes the handwriting as another paper is slid
next to it with an IDENTICAL SIGNATURE: "Kris Fischer".

INVESTIGATOR
And this is a deposit slip from
September.

KRIS

Yeah, that’s my writing. This isn’t
though, see? It’s forgery.

Maggie compares them: the same. She looks at Kris,
perplexed.

CUT TO:

The Investigator tries to put together a thoughtful
response.

INVESTIGATOR
Coerced. See the problem I’m having
is first you say theft then you say
your signature is forged. Now we’re
at coerced. I have no interest in

you’ve experienced something. I
just know that my ability to help
is coming to an end. From the
standpoint of the bank there has
been no wrongdoing.

The three are quiet, unsure how to move on.

INT. BANK/ BACK CORRIDOR - NEXT - DAY

28.

The Investigator is about to open a door to let Maggie into

a room but first prefaces:

INVESTIGATOR
I want you to understand this is
not something I’m doing because I
have to. The notary public
remembers her, the tellers
remember. But you’ve been very
polite and seem genuinely
bewildered by this so...

He opens the door to a room full of SECURITY CAMERA

MONITORS.

INT. KRIS’ HOUSE/ LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Kris stares at PRINTOUTS from the security footage: her at

the teller window on separate days, alone.

Maggie and their brother Rich (40) sit far away,

MAGGIE
And one more thing. Dad’s coins are
gone.

discussing:

Rich, already in shock, takes this hard. He can only laugh.

RICH
I have a good idea where it went,
Maggie! What are we intervening? Is
this where we do the whole -
because whatever she’s on (to Kris)
whatever you’re on I'll write a
check right now for the precise
amount it would take you to OD.
Give me a number!

MAGGIE

INT. KRIS’ HOUSE/ BATHROOM - NEXT - NIGHT

Maggie stares at the wall. Beyond her Kris removes her
nightgown and waits to be inspected in her underwear.

Maggie turns to Kris, sees the WOUNDS, and instantly has to
look away. She melts down in a horrified crying grimace.

MAGGIE
Baby Krissy.

INT. COMMUTER TRAIN - DAY
JEFF (35) finds a seat in the front car, heading for work

He sits up. Something is off. He looks around. Did he forget
something? He checks his bag, his wallet. Nothing.

His head is drawn toward the rear of the train. He suddenly
gets up and walks back with his belongings.

He moves into the next car back, checking the passengers.
Nothing. He has a seat there.

Still not right. He gets up again and moves back a car, his
hand tracing along the seats. He doesn’t know what he’s
after.

He enters the fourth car, sees Kris, thinks, sits across the
aisle from her. Her head rests on the window, headphones on,
eyes closed. Dressed CASUAL, her hair is SHORT BLONDE now.

He studies her, then her bag, her hands, the floor
thinking.

She opens her eyes, aware of something but not sure what.
She sits up, removes headphones, searches the room, lands on
Jeff.

Revision 1 30.

EXT. BREAKFAST STAND - NEXT - DAY

They finish coffee, exchanging business cards. She writes
her number on the back. Awkward but full of promise.

KRIS
...address is there. You ever need
signage of any kind, just call or
come down-

JEFF
Never in a million years would I
ever need that. Never. But I- this
is you?

KRIS
That’s me.

JEFF
I’1l call. Kris. I don’t have any
need for signage. I won’t be
calling for signage.

KRIS
Okay. Jeff.

JEFF
Okay. It was really good meeting
you.

They depart.

EXT. TRAIN STATION - DAY
Different day. Jeff waits for the train.

It comes. As it slows to a stop he scans each passenger car,
looking for someone.

He gets on, looks around, exits. The train departs.

He waits again.

INT. COMMUTER TRAIN - NEXT - DAY
Kris rides to work, her head in a catalog.

SOMETHING quietly draws her attention forward. She lifts her
eyes, then head, scanning outside.

Revision 1 31.

EXT. TRAIN STATION - NEXT - DAY

Jeff gives up on another train as it departs. Now it’s his
turn to be drawn. He looks down the empty railway.

CUT TO:

A new train is coming to stop. He walks alongside, not even
looking in the windows. He senses which car to enter.

He boards and finds a seat across the aisle from Kris who
turns back to him even before he arrives.

Silence. Jeff catches his breath. Kris is stoic.

JEFF
I called you.

She nods, not giving anything away.

JEFF (cont’d)
This makes me late for work- I
can’t do this everyday. You’re four
trains after me. So you’re going to
have to answer. If I call- I’m
gonna call. Again.

INT. BAR - NEXT - DAY

They sit near the window. She’s digging through her purse,
half-listening to...

JEFF
...I picked up an MBA in finance.
That’s what the firm does. There’s
a commercial side, other half’s
personal wealth.

KRIS
Where is it? [his job]

JEFF
You can actually see- see that
high-rise? Palomar building? C&L
Crowne. That’s us.

KRIS
Why do you take the train?

The purse-digging has become distracting. He goes quiet.

(CONTINUED)
79

CONTINUED: Revision 1 32.

KRIS
Everyone on there’s homeless or had
their license revoked or...you

know.

JEFF
You want to see my driver’s
license?

She finally retrieves a PRESCRIPTION PILL BOTTLE and puts it
on the table between them. After a moment, she explains:

KRIS
That’s a gift for us.

He doesn’t know what to do with that.

KRIS
There’s this path forward where I
wait to tell you. Then maybe you
use it as an excuse, maybe you
don’t- I don’t know. Last year I
was diagnosed bipolar. I take
those...and these. And it’s fine.

He stands a menu up to hide the bottle. He thinks.
KRIS (cont’d)
So that’s here now. Saved us at
least three to four weeks.
JEFF
I’1l just get the check and we can
get-
She’s not amused at his deadpan. He smiles.
JEFF (cont’d)
I’m sorry. That was stupid. I don’t
know what to say to that.
EXT. SIDEWALK - NEXT - DAY
They walk leisurely. It’s still a date of some kind.
JEFF
I’1l tell you...before we pass that
trashcan. I’1l have something.

They walk in silence, nearing the TRASHCAN. They pass it.
It’s not as amusing as he thinks it is. Finally...

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED: Revision 1 33.

JEFF (cont’d)
I’m divorced. Is that bad? It is,
right?

KRIS
It’s not great.

80 EXT. TRAIN STATION - NEXT - DAY

She’s about to step onto an ESCALATOR. They are winding
down.

JEFF
How’s that work...in movies? We
meet- we say we’ll meet tomorrow at
a place at noon. Say the taco place
at mockingbird. We say we’1l meet

and then...

KRIS
If we both show up we know we’re
good.

JEFF

Yeah, but how does it work? I show
up, you’re not there, that means
you don’t want...to try- but how
does that help me?

KRIS
And I wouldn’t know if you showed
or-

JEFF

Yeah, no that’s what it is. That’s
what it is. I get to feel okay
because I know you don’t know...you
don’t know I showed up so I don’t
feel foolish. I like that.

KRIS
I think...Jeff...I’m going to save
you some time. Thank you for lunch
but...

She moves away, gets on the escalator. He smirks, trying to
be amused at the insult. Instead he gets awkward and a bit
angry:

JEFF
Yeah, I’11 save you some time.

He starts down the stairs, walking alongside her.

INT. SIGN STORE - DAY

Kris operates a LARGE INDUSTRIAL PRINTER. She waits for it
to finish, getting lost in the drone of the machine, her
thoughts.

EXT. DOWNTOWN/ MAP RELIEF SCULPTURE - NEXT - DAY

She eats a sandwich on break, watching people. Her hand
rests behind her, lingering over the outline of TINY MODEL
BUILDINGS, which are part of the sculpture. She stays ona
particular one:

MATCH CUT:

EXT. C & L FINANCIAL - DAY
PUSH IN to the 30th floor of the HIGH RISE.

INT. C & L CROWNE FINANCIAL/ BREAK ROOM - DAY

Jeff has his PAPERWORK laid out on a table. People use the

VENDING MACHINES behind him. He wakes from a daze and looks
across the office floor, his eyes landing on a far away NAME
PLATE that reads "E. ALDERMAN". This means something to him.

Coincidentally, ALDERMAN steps out and speaks to his
secretary before heading away. Jeff watches him go.

An INTERN passes Jeff, which reminds him:

JEFF
Hey, these FLPs for the realty
group, they’1l be done by Thursday,
yeah? Cause when we put this in
front of them the first thing
they’11 ask for is-

INTERN 1
Yeah, I’1l try.

Jeff doesn’t like that answer but is staying friendly:

I'll really try.

And that’s the best he’s going to get so he resigns:
JEFF
All right.
EXT. CONVENIENCE STORE - NIGHT
He plays SCRATCH OFF LOTTERY TICKETS on a trash bin.
No luck. He tosses them. He’s about to leave when...
...instead he heads back inside...
JEFF
Give me two more. Three pick daily.
INT. CHAIN HOTEL / CHECK-IN - NEXT - NIGHT
Jeff walks past GUESTS checking in. He removes a FOLDER from
his bag, enters a back office, seemingly belonging there.
INT. CHAIN HOTEL/ BACK OFFICE - NEXT - NIGHT
He and the hotel owner, RAJ (50s), are poring over
FINANCIALS. He digs into a bowl of M&Ms, separating out the
BLUE ONES.
JEFF
Raj, we have clients with ten times
this revenue that don’t have near
tax liability you do. So we can
have another talk about how screwed
up the code is or you can take the
charge against and solve it.
CLOSER on the M&Ms, his hand stabbing into them.
RAJ
But the downtown hotel is
profitable.

They all are. This is fiscal, just

the quarter. You want to be right?
Or rich?

A HAND picks up STRAY CONCRETE BITS off the bottom of the
pool. Kris is swimming, hovering, scanning, searching the
pieces. Alone, quiet, small in the frame.

INT. CHAIN HOTEL / CHECK-IN - NEXT - NIGHT

A CLERK is checking Jeff in. It’s informal. Clerk is more
interested in a COWORKER’S story...

JEFF
Can I. Jim. Jimmy. Is there a
window room?

CLERK
They all have windows.

JEFF
I mean not facing the alley.

Raj passes by, gives Jeff a goodbye pat on the shoulder.

INT. CHAIN HOTEL/ SNACK STAND - NEXT - NIGHT
The place is dark and closed for the night. Jeff sneaks
behind the counter and snatches a BOX OF STRAWS.

INT. WESLEY’S FARMHOUSE/ MUSIC ROOM - DAY

Wesley listens to a symphonic score on HEADPHONES. The room
contains mics, synths, etc. He shakes his head, aggravated:

WESLEY
Incredible. What are you doing?
What are you doing? Goddamn it,
what are you doing?

INT. WESLEY’S FARMHOUSE/ LIVING ROOM - DAY
He studies SHEET MUSIC. Now a stereo BLARES the score.
WESLEY
I mean what is this? I don’t ever
want -
He shuts the music off.
WESLEY
These eight, nine notes are poison.
The refrain. I can’t hear it again.
Anathema.

We realize he’s speaking with someone on SPEAKERPHONE:

SPEAKERPHONE
Don’t know what to say. To my ears
there-

WESLEY

Okay, look. I’m going to clean this
up, send a new version in the
morning. For now, please, for my
own sanity, take a giant black
marker and redact
bars...9-13...22-26...no
28...35-37.

He rifles through sheet music, circling the appropriate
bars.

Wesley stands from a seated position and crouches near
another pig, pulling its collar to inspect its face.
EXT. STOREFRONT - INTERCUT - DAY

He stands on the sidewalk. A SHOPPER turns to face a window
near him, moving her head just like the pig did when pulled.

He "releases" her and she moves down the sidewalk. He turns.

EXT. PIGPEN - INTERCUT - DAY
He turns. Something is drawing him in. He steps away.

RED LIGHTS flash against his face as he approaches a pig.

EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - INTERCUT - DAY

A HUSBAND worriedly watches EMTs push his WIFE on a gurney
into an AMBULANCE, lights FLASHING. He’s in shock. A PLASTIC
SHOPPING BAG hangs from his fingers.

Among the ONLOOKERS behind him, Wesley arrives.
An EMT interviews a NEIGHBOR woman:

NEIGHBOR
I had seen her earlier from my
kitchen- she was weeding her garden
and when I looked back she’s lying
on the ground and I knew something
was wrong. I ran to the fence and
kept yelling "Jill! Jill!" but she
just wouldn’t...you know...

EMT talks to Husband:
EMT

-taking any kind of medication? She
have a health condition of any

kind?

HUSBAND
No. I mean, asthma. But just
asthma.

Neighbor gently takes the plastic bag from Husband:

EXT. PIGPEN - INTERCUT - DAY
Wesley has brought out his lawn chair, his notebook, and a
small SYNTH PAD. He sits next to the pig, composing.
INT. HOSPITAL WAITING AREA - INTERCUT - DAY
Husband sits, wide-eyed, worried, staring, thinking. Wesley
sits behind him on the opposite side of the row of chairs,
back to back, keeping close. He begins to hear FAINT VOICES.
He leans near Husband’s head and the VOLUME increases:
WIFE (OFF SCREEN)
I wanted to say that I hope today

is better and that I love you.

Closer still and he can see Husband’s thoughts:

INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - INTERCUT - DAY

Husband is trying to leave, his hand on the doorknob. Wife
pleads with him. Their clothes tell us it’s earlier today.

WIFE
And I made a list of the things I
want to try harder at. I love you.
HUSBAND
Goddamn it, Jillian. That doesn’t

fix anything. Just words. I gotta
go.

BULB.

He walks to the front door. Wife is in the kitchen.
HUSBAND (cont’d)
Yeah, they’re halogen. I got to run
up and get a pack.

WIFE
Wait a second.

He pauses as she approaches, something on her mind:
HUSBAND
Oh, now you want to talk...I’m
headed out the door?
WIFE
I just want to say that I hope
today is better and that I do love
you.
We’re back where we started. Except slightly different:
HUSBAND
Damn it, Jill. This is worthless.
Doesn’t fix anything. I’1l be back.
He opens the door. Steps out.
CUT TO: 10 seconds ago:
He’s at the door. She walks to him.

HUSBAND (cont’d)
Leave me alone, Jillian. Not now.

WIFE
I want this to be a good day. I
love you.

He opens the door. It repeats again:
WIFE (cont’d)

I think you were right about a lot
of things and I hope today is

peaceful -

It’s just words. Doesn’t fix

Husband is still piecing it together. Then one more...

EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - INTERCUT - DAY
He walks out again. This time it plays out longer:

He gets half way to the car, scanning the front lawn. He
turns back to see her waiting in the doorway.

HUSBAND
I’1l get some washers for that
sprinkler head. All right?

She nods. He walks away.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - INTERCUT - DAY

A NURSE holds the door open, letting Husband into the room.
There is no urgency. Wife is still. An INTEBATION TUBE has
been removed. Husband stays at the foot of the bed.

Against the wall Wesley is near tears, connected
emotionally.

EXT. PIGPEN - INTERCUT - DAY

He’s picking out notes on the synth. Chord structures loop
and grow, heightening to a crescendo.

Then he stops it all except for one SMALL REPEATING NOTE.

INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - INTERCUT - DAY

Husband has arrived back at his home. He sits upright on the
couch alone, staring, in shock.

The note stops.

INT. SIGN STORE - DAY

Jeff walks in, scans the counter. Kris isn’t there.

BACK ROOM

She’s on a break talking to a coworker. We can see Jeff way
up front. Her head suddenly lifts a bit. Without looking she
knows he’s near. It’s a pleasant thought. She dwells on
it...

KRIS
I need to go up front.

INT. COMMUTER TRAIN - NIGHT
Kris and Jeff sit at the rear of car, watching a WOMAN KNIT:
JEFF
She’s a...former Senator. Nobel
winner. But her category was
mittens. And she just never found a
way to monetize it so she takes the
train. Continues her research.
They play a game, guessing what’s wrong with people. A MAN:

KRIS
He’s divorced. Cause she cheated.

She checks Jeff’s response. It’s a subtle: No.

KRIS
Or he did. He cheated.

No.
KRIS (cont’d)
He has these anger issues, couldn’t
cope.
Hmmm. Interesting but no.

KRIS (cont’d)
Alcoholic.

Wow, close.
KRIS (cont’d)
No, but a substance of some kind.
An illegal kind.

He admits it with silence.

113 EXT. TRAIN STATION - NEXT - NIGHT
They walk away from the station into the night.
KRIS

I would think there are some
marriages that could survive that.

Maybe.
JEFF
Maybe. But...
KRIS
Not yours.
JEFF

Not ours. From her perspective
everything flipped just like that.
The guy she thought she married
turned out to be somebody else, a
junkie basically. The savings she
thought we were building, the
plans, reset to zero. Lights turn
on. I’m on a bender holed up ina
hotel in Reno.

BEAT

KRIS

You do a program or something?
JEFF

At ACS. See? Problem, solution.

Done and done. And you thought you

weren’t into me.

114 EXT. KRIS’ RUNDOWN APARTMENT - NEXT - NIGHT

She’s trying to say goodnight. He’s not. They hover close.

KRIS
I have to open the store.

JEFF
Not that early. I bet...

KRIS
No, I’m lucky to have that job.

The sign store job. You’re lucky?

It’s not my fault when it goes

JEFF
Yes it is.

INT. KRIS’ RUNDOWN APARTMENT/ KITCHEN - NEXT - NIGHT
They kiss, getting aggressive.

BEDROOM

They’re asleep in her bed.

On Jeff’s left and Kris’ right ankle we see MATCHING SCARS:
a circle with an odd "+" in the middle.

We crane above Kris and Jeff until we see they are now not
on the bed at all but instead on a bed sheet laid on the...
EXT. PIGPEN - MORNING

...GROUND. They stay asleep, surrounded by pigs.

PAN OVER to see Wesley pushing a WHEELBARROW to the pen.

He pours several bags of feed into the TROUGH. As the pigs
jockey for position, he tosses in some BROWN BANANAS, etc.

The pigs FEAST greedily.

INT. KRIS’ RUNDOWN APARTMENT/ KITCHEN - MORNING

SCRAMBLED EGGS SIZZLE in a pan. They make breakfast.

Jeff butters toast, gets jam from the fridge. Kris’ eyes
follow him back and forth. When he gets close she lunges at
him for a brief kiss, almost desperate. Then nervous.

INT. CHAIN HOTEL/ JEFF’S ROOM - NIGHT

They enter the room. Jeff shows her around.

KRIS (OFF SCREEN)
Why do you live in hotels?

(CONTINUED)
119

CONTINUED: Revision 1 46.

JEFF (OFF SCREEN)
I do the books for a group that
owns a few of them so...it’s sort
of a perk.

She’s sitting on the bed, her jacket still on, not
comfortable. He reads a room service menu.

KRIS
Right but why do you choose to?

JEFF
Are you hungry? You got to be.

INT. CHAIN HOTEL/ RESTAURANT KITCHEN - NEXT - NIGHT

He leads her by the hand to the back entrance to the
kitchen.

CUT TO:
The place is empty. They eat burgers they made themselves.

KRIS
They always remind me of family
vacations. I think it’s the smell,
the chlorine or bleach on the
sheets. Glasses in plastic.

JEFF
There was this place in Vermont we
would go when we were kids. It was
some sort of colonial historical
site- museums and you know...but
what stands out is the hotel we
would stay at had an indoor pool
and this was just the biggest deal
in the world for us, for my
brothers. I mean indoor...and you
can swim. We would lose it.

She looks at him, almost troubled, scrutinizing.

JEFF (cont’d)
What? What are you thinking?

She waves it off. Nothing.

Revision 1 47.

EXT. WESLEY’S FARMHOUSE - DAY

Wesley is bringing in GROCERIES from the car. He sees
something in the pen that causes him to halt for a second.
He watches before moving on.

EXT. PIGPEN - NEXT - DAY

He approaches with a BAG OF PEANUTS, eating a few. He stops
at the fence, watching...

In a corner of the pen TWO PIGS, K and J have isolated
themselves from the others. K lies down and J looks like
he’s standing guard.

Wesley moves to them while staying outside the fence. He
throws a couple peanuts on the ground. J gobbles them up.

Wesley throws some more, this time closer to the rest of the
pigs. J moves in that direction but won’t go past a certain

point. Other pigs finally come for the peanuts. J gives them
a LOW GRUNT, warding them off. Wesley’s not happy with this.

WESLEY
No! No!

He throws the whole bag, trying to coax J away from K.
WESLEY (cont’d)
Go. Go! Get!
INT. CHAIN HOTEL/ JEFF’S ROOM - MORNING
Jeff’s cell phone BUZZES on the desk, a message.

From the bed Kris notices and looks to the bathroom where
Jeff is showering.

Out and dressed now, he’s putting on a tie.

KRIS
You have a message.

JEFF
Oh, thank you.

He checks it. She waits. He goes back to getting ready.

For a second he pretends to not understand, but:

KRIS
To the banquet.

JEFF
Oh, you know. It’1l be like work.
It’s people from work. For three
hours. Feels like...work.
He sees she was hoping for a different answer...
JEFF (cont’d)
I thought we could go though. If
you want.
She tries to hide how happy this makes her.

JEFF (cont’d)
Do you want to?

Yes, more than anything but she can only nod and smile.

INT. TAXI - DUSK
Kris, DRESSED for the party, enjoys the ride DOWNTOWN.

INT. CERULEAN PLAZA HOTEL/ LOBBY - NEXT - DUSK
Jeff waits for her, keeping an eye on the front.
A COWORKER approaches, introduces his DATE, heads inside.

Jeff stays, waiting, thinking, worried.

EXT. CERULEAN PLAZA HOTEL - NEXT - DUSK

The taxi arrives. Jeff opens the door for Kris and pays. She
takes in the hotel, ready to walk in...

...but he needs to talk, points away from the hotel and...

...leads her by the hand across the street, dodging
traffic...
Revision 1 49.

126 INT. COFFEE SHOP - NEXT - DUSK

They’re at a small table. Kris waits for him to speak as he
nervously removes the PAPER WRAPPERS from straws.

JEFF
I...I like you so much.
KRIS
Shit. You kidding me? I bought a

dress-

He holds up a hand to keep her calm. She’s got the wrong
idea.

JEFF
I have been very careful not
to...lie. But through omission you
may have gotten the wrong- I gave
you a different impression than
is...real. And if we walk into that
hotel you’re gonna know.

Kris looks to the door like she might bolt. She doesn’t.

KRIS
Okay...

JEFF
I’m not an advisor. I don’t broker.
I do...interdepartmental reports.

KRIS
That still sounds impressive-

JEFF
It’s not. I work with interns.
Alongside interns. Craig pays me in
cash to keep me off their books
cause if there was an audit I’ma
liability.

Kris almost smiles, relieved, but still wonders...

KRIS
I don’t...what does that last part
mean-

JEFF

I stole money, Kris. From a client.
Shifted it from account to account
until I could grab it.

(CONTINUED)
127

128

CONTINUED: Revision 1

KRIS
Because of...Reno?

JEFF
Lost my broker’s license. And they
covered for me but if I was anybody
else, didn’t have a relationship
with Craig or his brother I’d be in
prison. I’m lucky to have that job.

KRIS
License.

50.

She stares at his hands. He has made a CHAIN with the straw
wrappers like she made with Evan. But she doesn’t remember.

KRIS
That was smart...waiting to tell
me. Cause what am I gonna do now?

JEFF
I’m sorry.

KRIS

I think you might be using that
wrong.

INT. CHAIN HOTEL/ JEFF’S ROOM - DAWN

Jeff sleeps. Kris pours a cup of room service coffee.

CUT TO:

She sits near his feet, drinking, looking at his ankle, the

WORM SCAR. She’s not alarmed. She’s seen it before.

JEFF
Morning.

She stays on his ankle, in a daze....
KRIS,
I might be pregnant.

WESLEY
They’re not following the
composition, they’re following what
they played last season or a year
before...right they ARE
professional so they should be able
to read the page without bringing
their own- yes, I know. Tomorrow
then. Good night.

He hangs up, continues playback, but then stops it,
listening:

LOUD PIG GRUNTS erupt from outside. WOOD BREAKING.
He steps to the window, flips on the lights over the pen.

He scans with binoculars.

EXT. PIGPEN - DAY

He carries a few 8-foot lengths of wood to the fence.

He inspects the damage: CRACKED FENCE POST and BOARDS.

He looks into the pen: K and J still isolated from the rest.

He starts repairs, pulling off the damaged wood.

CUT TO:
Wesley walks with a VET into the pen toward K and J.
WESLEY
...won’t let anyone near them. They
crowd back in the corner.
Violent...
VET
If I had to guess...here get him,
hold him back...if I had to
guess...
CUT TO:

Vet is feeling K’s belly. Wesley holds J back with rope.

VET (cont’d)
Yeah, she has a litter on the way.
They can get very protective. Might
explain. But you’ve had litters
here? Surely.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED: Revision 1 52.

WESLEY
Yeah, just never had them break my
damn fence. Never seen the parents
behave so...

Vet is scanning the pen, seems to have a question.

WESLEY (cont’d)
No, I don’t keep them around.

Wesley wants this conversation over, starts heading back.

VET
Well, I was going to say if you
ever -

WESLEY
There’s a fellow down the way buys
them off me.

VET

I see. If you do need another buyer
I know a petting farm always needs
piglets...

WESLEY
Oh, sure, sure. Thank you so much.

130 INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE/ EXAMINATION ROOM - DAY
Kris sits in a gown across from a female OBGYN.

OBGYN
First off. You...are not pregnant.

KRIS
No, I took a test. I am.

OBGYN
Well, you can’t always trust those.
And the HCG in your blood tells us
that you are not. So that’s more
definitive.

Kris isn’t buying this. Pompous doctors...

KRIS,
Uh-huh. Okay.

OBGYN
Now I want to make sure we have
correct records. You didn’t list it

OBGYN (cont’d)
in your questionnaire, but have you
had any surgical procedures on your
pelvic area?

KRIS
No. I would have put that down.

OBGYN
Maybe a cyst was removed? Biopsy?

Kris shakes her head no. Why is she asking?

OBGYN
Okay.

Obgyn exits politely, leaving Kris with questions. She can
hear Obgyn in the hall telling a nurse:

OBGYN (OFF SCREEN)
Let’s get her a pelvic CT and white
cell count. Put...sonogram
inconclusive.

INT. CAT SCAN MONITOR ROOM - NIGHT

Obgyn consults with a COLLEAGUE in front of MONITORS showing
CT SCANS. They point to a DARK VOID on the screen:

COLLEAGUE
I’d say post cancer. This is where
they removed the tumor, this
cavity.

OBGYN
Mm-hmm. She says no.

COLLEAGUE
No what? Someone was in there.
Trauma here...and here.

OBGYN
Mm-hmm. How are you supposed to
help someone like that?

He hurries across the street to a...

INT. BAR - NEXT - DAY

TwO EMPTY SHOT GLASSES sit before him. He downs a third and
orders a fourth. It’s settling him.

OBGYN (OFF SCREEN)
By all appearances, and this is
Doctor Pear’s opinion as well, you
are a survivor of stage three
endometrial cancer.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DUSK
Kris recovers in bed. Obgyn sits across from her:

OBGYN
The good news is there’s no sign of
any remaining carcinoma. Labs show
you’re in no immediate danger. But
the trauma it left behind is
significant.

become pregnant and...

Kris wanders to the exit, trancelike, despondent.
OBGYN (OFF SCREEN)

INT. TAXI - NEXT - DUSK
Jeff rides, scanning. He sees Kris walking, tells cabbie:
JEFF
Here, here, pull over.

EXT. TRAIN STATION - CONTINUOUS - DUSK

She turns a corner to start up the stairs to the platform.
Jeff comes after her, desperate:

JEFF
Krissy! Krissy!

He runs up. She falls into him, breaks down.

JEFF (cont’d)
Why’d you go? I looked for you.

KRIS.
I’m broken. Something happened to
me...

Why can’t you see them? Why?

KRIS
I’m not allowed, Jeff! I. flipped.
over. My whole beginning was a fake
out. This is who I’ve always been.
How are you not seeing that?

I don’t see it! I don’t see it. I
need to marry you. I’m marrying
you. I want a house and- I’m
married to you. Right now. There’s
only us.

KRIS
I’m broken.

JEFF
I don’t care. I don’t care. You're
the only one who knows me. I’m
going to be so much better for you.
I’m going to get a ring, we’re
going to get all the things we’re
supposed to. And we’re going to-

KRIS
Can we get a car?

He smiles. Right now he’d do anything.
KRIS
Today?
EXT. RURAL ROAD NEAR REFINERY - NIGHT
Jeff and Kris sit in a BEAT-UP TERCEL with "FOR SALE"

painted on the window. It’s stopped at a FORK in the road
near the 4 striped towers where Wesley left Kris.
Revision 1 57.

143 INT. TERCEL - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

Jeff looks around, trying to form an answer to:

KRIS
Do you know this place?

JEFF
I want to say yes for you. I want
to.

KRIS

It’s okay. Let me...if you had to
pick a direction, one of these
roads here...is there one you feel
more...drawn to?

JEFF
Do you?

She wants his answer first. He looks again, really trying.
He checks her face for clues and subtly gestures to the
left.
This makes her happy. He must have guessed correctly.
The car takes off down the left road.

CUT TO:

They pull into the next fork in the road:

KRIS
Which way do you think? I say
right.

JEFF

I say...right.
She looks at him. He looks back: what?
KRIS

Don’t just say what I say and don’t
let my vote affect yours.

JEFF
Okay. What about you? You can’t
let-

KRIS

Kris’s expectations are dashed. The cards: "right" and

She gets out, looking for clues on the horizon. From the
car:

JEFF
Maybe you feel stronger than me. So
we should just...

INT. C & L CROWNE FINANCIAL/ LIBRARY - DAY

Jeff sits at a computer, browsing Craigslist for houses. On
screen is an AD with pictures of a SUBURBAN HOUSE.

He flicks the mouse and 12 ADS FAN OUT. The ICON travels
over them until another is selected. On the next page we see
the text: "2221 Point Merit" and "Call Danny".

Jeff searches "2221 point merit danny", clicks on a link. A
page of home owner records comes up. Next to "2221 Point
Merit" we see the name "Daniel Goudelin".

He searches "danny goudelin", finds an article on a local
restaurant with a picture of a MAN standing proudly in front
of "Goudelin’s Eatery". The caption below reads: "Owner/
Proprietor Danny Goudelin".

Jeff thinks, begins muttering to himself. We barely hear:

JEFF
I had a failed business. I had a
business collapse. Well, thanks. It
was a restaurant. Um, there was a
zoning issue.

INT. 2221 POINT MERIT - DAY

Jeff talks quietly with DANNY who is showing the EMPTY
HOUSE.

JEFF
...thing is my personal credit is
mixed up with my business which
failed last year. It was leveraged
pretty heavily and now there’s no
way to separate my social from the
restaurant’s tax id. So I thought
if you’re open to it we could-

DANNY
I actually run a restaurant myself.

JEFF
You’re kidding. Then you know what
I’m talking about.

DANNY
Oh, sure. Let’s do this though. We
can run your wife’s credit, do it
in her name.

Kris inspects the kitchen, faucet, lights, the TILED FLOOR.
JEFF (OFF SCREEN)

Same situation. But if you’re

willing I can pay cash for three

months in advance plus last month

of the lease...

The collar goes around J’s head and CINCHES tight.

J GRUNTS and SQUEALS as Wesley pulls him to a remote pen.

INT. C & L CROWNE FINANCIAL - INTERCUT - DAY

Jeff carries a BOX of reports down an aisle. The Interns
follow. Jeff is agitated, suspicious of them. He turns:

JEFF
What are you doing?

INTERN 1
We’re not...what do you mean?

He stares at them, sure they’re up to something. Angry.

JEFF
You guys are unbelievable.

They’re stunned, speechless.

JEFF (cont’d)
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT?!

He grabs Intern 1, trips him, throws him on his back, gets
in his face, menacing.

Intern 2 moves to fend him off so Jeff swipes at him,
missing.

Jeff tries to stand on Intern 1’s throat, hoping to grab a
piece of Intern 2. He gets his shirtsleeve and some hair.

JEFF (cont’d)
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?! HUH?!

Things come to an awkward pause. No one knows what to do.

Jeff releases them both and staggers away, getting scared
now.

He heads for the elevator, loosening his collar and tie.

EXT. PIGPEN - INTERCUT - DAY

Wesley closes the gate on J who RAMS the post angrily.

INT. C & L CROWNE FINANCIAL - INTERCUT - DAY

Jeff is in the elevator. The DOORS are closing when he
blocks them with his arm, holding them open, not ready to
let go. He’s getting worked up, thinking. Angrier.

He exits, storming down the row of offices to...
ALDERMAN’S OFFICE

At his desk Alderman hangs up the phone. Jeff stands just
inside the doorway. The office is abuzz behind him.

JEFF
This won’t work anymore. You’re

Alderman stands, wanting to reason with him.

ALDERMAN
Jeff...

Jeff VIOLENTLY STRIKES his palms together, posturing:

JEFF
COME ON!

Alderman calmly moves to the door, passing him.
ALDERMAN
Jeff, whatever you think is going
on, people here aren’t against you.
We always-
In a flash, Jeff grabs him and SLAMS him into a cabinet.
JEFF
I didn’t say talk to me! Leave!

EXT. SIGN STORE/ ALLEYWAY - INTERCUT - DAY

The door BANGS open and out comes Kris, frantically dialing
her phone. She hurries down the alley. The call won’t work

She crouches next to a dumpster to concentrate on the phone,
shielding it from the rain. It fails again.

KRIS
GODDAMN IT! Piece of shit!

She PUNCHES a discarded PLATE GLASS, shattering it.

EXT. PIGPEN - INTERCUT - DAY

Wesley loops the collar around K and fastens the pole to the
nearest fence post. She fights it.

She KICKS and SQUEALS furiously as Wesley pulls each piglet

Jeff surveys his reclaimed office, not sure what he’s won.
In his confusion something nags at him...

He pulls his phone from his pocket, holds it out like he’s
waiting for it to do something. Nothing.

He places it down on the desk and focuses on it:

JEFF
Ring. Ring.

He snaps out of it as a POLICE RADIO SQUAWKS far off.

He bolts towards the stairs.

INT. C & L CROWNE FINANCIAL/ PARKING GARAGE - NEXT - DAY

Jeff exits the stairway and hurries to his car.

Straight. Past the chairs. Then
left.

JEFF (cont’d)
101B on the right. Brown door.

She opens it, but...

KRIS
No, it’s just a room.

JEFF
You’re cutting through it. Go on.

She moves to a door on the other side of the room, which
leads to another hall and finally an exit outdoors. She
opens it:

The Tercel comes screeching to halt in front of her.

JEFF (cont’d)
Let’s go!

They drive away from what we now see is his office building.

JEFF (cont’d)
Why are you at my office?!

She looks back at the building:

KRIS,
I didn’t know it was.

JEFF
Where are we going? Home? Home!?

KRIS,
Home.
EXT. KRIS & JEFF’S HOUSE - NEXT - DAY

They rush from the kitchen to the garage to a hall closet.
We’re always too late to see exactly what they’re doing:

JEFF

No, no, I’ve got it, I’ve got it.

Get that! Come on!
They end up in the BATHROOM. The DOOR slams. Then SILENCE.
BATHROOM
Jugs of water are stashed on the floor next to a loaf of
bread and some fruit. Kris’ HANDGUN lies on a towel at the
ready as well as an AXE. Furniture barricades the door.
Kris and Jeff nest in the tub, now lined with BLANKETS. They
watch the door fearfully, holding each other, waiting.
EXT. CREEK BRIDGE - INTERCUT - DAY

Wesley’s truck pulls to the middle of the bridge, 30 feet
above the water.

He grabs the sack from the truck bed and TOSSES it over...
...where it PLUNGES UNDERWATER. The piglets SQUIRM VIOLENTLY
in the sack as it rises to the surface, floating downstream.
EXT. CREEK - NEXT - DAY

Further downstream the sack floats over tiny falls then calm
water until it gets snagged on a TREE BRANCH.

It rests there on the water. Lifeless.

Carcass #1, waterlogged, sinks below the surface until it
comes to rest on the creek bed surrounded by rocks.

INT. KRIS & JEFF’S HOUSE/ BATHROOM - INTERCUT - DUSK

Kris sinks underwater, almost unaware that she’s doing it.
Her EYES stay transfixed at some point miles away.

EXT. CREEK/ DRAINAGE DITCH - INTERCUT - DUSK

Carcass #2 also sinks, also rests at the bottom.

INT. KRIS & JEFF’S HOUSE/ BATHROOM - INTERCUT - DUSK

Kris lies completely still, staring underwater. Seconds go
by.

Suddenly, she emerges, remembering to breathe, GASPING.

INT. KRIS & JEFF’S HOUSE/ LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Kris is curled up on the floor, not watching the TV that
lights her. Despondent. Jeff watches her from the next room:

JEFF
We should go on a trip. Get
somewhere.
CUT TO:

He’s lying next to her on the floor now. They whisper:

KRIS
Where would we go?
JEFF
Somewhere...bright.
KRIS
Maybe to Vermont. To that place you
know.
JEFF

Yeah, maybe.

KRIS
How do you get there?

He’s confused and suspects she’s toying with him.
KRIS
How do you get to the place your
family used to go? In Vermont. The
vacation.

Now he’s sure of it:

Revision 1 68.
JEFF
You drive, Kris.
KRIS
What road?
JEFF

I’d have to get a map.

KRIS
You don’t remember?

JEFF
Some...country road. I was six.

She pauses, giving him every chance before she unloads:

KRIS
I was six. You go through three
covered bridges made of red-painted
wood and after the second one we
stop for samples at the old taffy
factory and that’s how you know
you’re halfway there.

JEFF
I don’t...I don’t know. I was a
kid.

KRIS
I was a kid. It was me. You took
it.

JEFF
I don’t know what- doesn’t prove
anything.

KRIS

It proves you may be in my head,
but you’re still too stupid to
understand me. Or anything.

CUT TO:

They’re standing now. He’s walking away. Louder.

JEFF
And what about the trampoline...and
Mick?

KRIS

That’s you. That’s yours.

CONTINUED:

Revision 1 69.

JEFF
Oh, thank you. And Renny? Renny.
Almost drowned me? Then lied to his
mom about it?

KRIS
Me. That’s mine. That happened to
me.

JEFF

Kris...Mick and Renny were best
friends! Explain that! How would I
know one and-

KRIS
They weren’t friends. They never
met. You pushed them together.

He gets quiet, shakes his head: This is idiotic.

KRIS
Where would you get...cocaine?

JEFF
I’m sorry, where would I what?!

KRIS
If you wanted it. I know you don’t
because you’re recovering. But if
you did...where would you?

JEFF
You’re a prize, Kris. A real
treasure.

KRIS

Shouldn’t be that hard. You’re an
addict. Had a huge addiction. Blew
your savings, your marriage. Ruined
your life. Some story about running
off to Reno to hit bottom. You must
crave it all the time. Where would
you get it? Or is it possible that
you don’t know the first thing
about -

JEFF
There’s guys at ACS. They come to
group. But they’re not done. They
don’t engage. Everybody knows. They
still sell. So...

CONTINUED:

Revision 1 70.
KRIS
So you’d get it from them?
JEFF
Yeah.
KRIS

So the best place you can think of
to get a fix for you’re horrible
addiction is the same place you
started going to get over the
supposed addiction?

JEFF
I don’t think I like that word
‘supposed’.

He walks away again, searching DRAWERS as he goes.

KRIS
Yeah, you got bigger problems than
vocabulary. How do you use? You
snort it? How much? Inject it? With
what exactly? Use one of those
spoons? You have a kit? Where do
you get it? And don’t say the
goddamn meetings!

He’s found a FOLDER he was looking for. He lays it out for
her, showing RECEIPTS one by one:

Revision 1 71.

EXT. CREEK/ ROCKY BANK - DAY

Carcass #1 has decayed. Only a SMALL HOOF is recognizable in
the mass of rotting flesh. EMBEDDED in what was once the
abdomen is a golf ball-sized SPORE.

EXT. CREEK/ DRAINAGE DITCH - DAY

Another spore lies near Carcass #2.

Suddenly, it SHOOTS out a TURQUOISE POWDER in all
directions.

The powder clouds the water as it RISES to the surface.

It clumps on the water, accumulating against the grassy
bank.

Growing on the bank is a patch of 30 WHITE ORCHIDS.

EXT. WOODS - DAWN

Elise (70) and her granddaughter Phoebe (15) search among
the trees for something, wearing BACKPACKS and SMALL GARDEN
TOOLS.

PHOEBE
Gram. Gram, what about this?

She’s found a patch of WILD YELLOW FLOWERS. Elise crouches
next to her, inspecting:

ELISE
Oh, yes. These are lovely.

PHOEBE
Should I take some?

Elise is looking elsewhere, not able to hide her
disinterest.

ELISE
Certainly. Put them in with yours.
I’1l go ahead to the bankside.

Phoebe smiles, appreciating the false politeness. They
depart.
178

Revision 1 72.

EXT. CREEK/ DRAINAGE DITCH - NEXT - DAWN

They look down the embankment to a PATCH OF WHITE ORCHIDS.
Elise smiles, having found it:

ELISE
Do you see? In the middle?

She walks down, followed by Phoebe.

CUT TO:
They kneel, digging up several TURQUOISE ORCHIDS that grow
amidst the white ones and packing them in soil and burlap.
EXT. CABIN/ FRONT PORCH - DUSK

Phoebe plays a GAME on her phone, stopping when Elise sits
down next to her to enjoy the air.

ELISE
Don’t stop for me. Do you worry
you’11 miss a call?

PHOEBE
You mean...because I’m playing a
game?

Phoebe finds her ignorance sweet but doesn’t let on:

PHOEBE
No, I’m not worried.

ELISE
Did you write today?

PHOEBE
I opened it. But...nothing really
happened today.

ELISE
Of course it did. We scouted. Had a
great breakfast. Saw mayflies- a
storm of them.

Phoebe smiles, not really inspired, but...

Revision 1 73.

INT. CABIN/ DINING ROOM - NEXT - DUSK

Phoebe sits at the table in front of an open JOURNAL. The
page is blank. She flips a pencil over and over.

Beyond her Elise prepares dinner in the kitchen.

INT. CABIN - DAY

Phoebe is working on an ELABORATE FLORAL ARRANGEMENT.
RIBBONS, SOIL, many different kinds of PLANTS and FLOWERS
lay on the table in front of her. She references a
HAND-DRAWN PLAN, a SKETCH, and a PHOTOGRAPH of an
arrangement taken years ago.

She unwraps two turquoise orchids from burlap, cuts the
stems.

CUT TO:

She takes a picture of the FINISHED ARRANGEMENT with a
phone.

CUT TO:
She disassembles the arrangement. Each flower is packed in
WET NEWSPAPER, rolled in CLEAR FILM, and placed ina
separate BOX. Then the boxes go in a RED COOLER. Phoebe
stops, seeing:
An INCHWORM is on an orchid, chewing into the blue pigment.

She checks the soil still in the burlap: SEVERAL WORMS.

INT. GREENHOUSE - NEXT - DAY
She holds one out for Elise to see. She’s not surprised:

ELISE
I see. And they’re all like that?

PHOEBE
I’ve only opened two and they’re
infested.

ELISE
Spray them down. Salvage the
best...three.

She finds a BOTTLE of homemade bug spray for Phoebe.

CONTINUED: Revision 1 74.

PHOEBE
Throw the rest out?

ELISE

No.
EXT. PLANT NURSERY - DAY
The leftover turquoise orchids, now in plastic pots, are
mixed among other wildflowers on one of 4 PALETTES in the
back of Elise’s station wagon. Each pot has an “E + P
EXOTICS” STICKER. Phoebe and a nursery employee unload them,
stacking the palettes at the rear of the building.

Elise waits in the passenger seat, the red cooler behind
her.

CUT TO:
Finished, Phoebe gets into the driver’s seat.

ELISE
Receipt?

PHOEBE
They didn’t give me one.

ELISE
You’11 always have to ask.

EXT. HIGHWAY - NEXT - DAY

Phoebe drives. Elise has nodded off against the window.

CUT TO:
ELISE
Why not...if the other girls like
him?
PHOEBE

So I should go along with whatever
random girls say?

ELISE
No, I’m asking why. The boy doesn’t
matter. You will have to pare down
a wide selection to get one that
does. I’m asking for the reason.

Phoebe shakes her head, unsure.

ELISE
Is he ugly? Is he an ugly boy,
dear?
This cracks Phoebe up. Crazy grandma.

PHOEBE
He’s not pretty.

ELISE
Then write that down.

PHOEBE
I can’t. I left it. I’m sorry.
EXT. GAS STATION - NEXT - DAY

Phoebe pours more BAGS OF ICE into the cooler, letting WATER
drain from its spout. Gas is pumping.

Elise returns to the car from the store with a SHOPPING BAG.

She drops it on the front seat: A NEW JOURNAL and PENS.

EXT. CERULEAN PLAZA HOTEL - DUSK

They wait as a PORTER transfers their LUGGAGE and the red
cooler to a roller. He follows them inside.

INT. KRIS & JEFF’S HOUSE - DAY
The refrigerator is DRIPPING WATER onto the tiled floor.

Kris crouches down, inspecting. The water pools, slowly
spreading throughout the channels of grout in the tile.

She moves to the outer edge of the spread where a single
STREAM is creeping towards a 4-way split. She’s captivated
by it, which says more about her mood than anything. She
sets down a HALF-FINISHED GLASS OF WINE on the floor
waiting.

The water finally meets the junction and does what we
expect, following each of the 3 new channels. She studies
them.
188

189

Revision 1 76.

INT. CERULEAN PLAZA HOTEL/ GUEST ROOM - NIGHT

Phoebe refills TwO GLASSES from a WINE BOX. She turns to
Elise who has tried on a new dress, waiting for a critique.

PHOEBE
Love it. Very you. Perfect. I have
a pair of hose for you instead of
those socks.

ELISE
No. I like socks.

BALCONY

They enjoy the air, the wine, city sounds. Phoebe has the
new journal open on her lap, pen in hand.

PHOEBE
Gram, I don’t think you could
explain any of these things either.
Like, you quit smoking and my mom
can’t. Why? I mean why, uh, why’d
you pick that car when all you do
is complain about the color? Why’d
you marry grandpa? Why anything.

That last one resonates with Elise.

PHOEBE
It’s impossible to know for most
things.

ELISE

No, not impossible. But it will be,
looking back. That’s why you keep a
record.

INT. KRIS & JEFF’S HOUSE - DAY

Kris is tipsy now. She’s balancing herself like a tightrope
walker, arms out at her side, wine glass in one hand.

ELISE (OFF SCREEN)
If not you’1l say oh I must have
been thinking this or that or maybe
I’m just that kind of person. It’1l
be a blank white page and you’1l
mark it up with best guesses. And
after that...

She moves from one floor tile to the next in the row, one
foot per tile, keeping straight. Then another and another.

(CONTINUED)
190

191

CONTINUED: Revision 1 77.

ELISE (OFF SCREEN) (cont’d)
...after that happens I don’t know
if you can ever change it. The
words become you.

On the next step her foot hovers over the tile, not ready to
land. Slowly it MOVES OVER to an adjacent tile on the right.
Again it hovers there like she’s not sure if it will support
her. She TOUCHES DOWN and slowly rests more weight on it,
then moves the other foot over. A tiny change has occurred.

INT. H & R BLOCK - DAY

Wearing an EMPLOYEE SHIRT, Jeff helps a couple with taxes.

INT. KRIS & JEFF’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Jeff arrives home, drops his bag, walks to the kitchen,
sees:

Kris waits for him, her hair changed back to DARK BROWN. She
wears her former OFFICE CLOTHES. He’s surprised, suspicious.

JEFF
Goodness.

KRIS
You like it? The color?

JEFF
Yeah, it’s...beautiful. Goodness.
What are you wearing?

KRIS
This is how I dress.

JEFF
No, it isn’t.

She sits him down with something to say:
KRIS

I’m not sick. My mind is healthy.
There is no imbalance chemically.

JEFF
Dr. Weitz said that?
KRIS
No. I haven’t seen him in five

months.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED: Revision 1 78.

JEFF
Who then? You seeing a new- who
told you that?

She stares at him until he gets it.

JEFF (cont’d)
You stopped taking your meds?

She doesn’t say no. She’s staying calm, knowing he won’t.

JEFF (cont’d)
How long?

KRIS
Eight months. Eight months and I’ve
been fine. No highs and lows.
Just...normal.

JEFF
Yeah. Was it normal when you locked
us in the bathroom with a handgun?

KRIS
We did that. We locked ourselves
in. We-

JEFF

Now I’m realizing. Now it makes
some kind of sense. You show up at
my work. You’re manic. I feed off
it. It’s delusional. No wonder -

KRIS
It was us.

JEFF
It was you!

KRIS.
You’re rewriting it.

JEFF
Oh. Oh.

He suddenly stands up violently, kicking the chair over.
CUT TO:

He rummages through her medicine cabinet, drawers, her
purse, until he finds the PILL BOTTLE.

CUT TO:

(CONTINUED)
192

CONTINUED: Revision 1 79.

She’s still in her seat as he steps back into the dining
room. He calmly returns the chair to its place, sits, puts
the bottle in front of her. He maintains his composure:

JEFF (cont’d)
You. Will. Take- I am not doing
this shit. You will take these...as
prescribed. Or. You will
never...see me...again.

CUT TO:
He storms out the front door.

She flushes the pills down the toilet.

INT. CERULEAN PLAZA HOTEL/ BANQUET HALL - DAY

A GARDEN SHOW AND FLOWER COMPETITION is being held. Tables
are lined with horticulture products, publications, and
flowers.

Along a wall are the FLORAL ARRANGEMENTS in competition. 3
JUDGES are inspecting them, taking notes, discussing.

They arrive at Phoebe’s creation. They seem to like it,
paying close attention to the orchids at the center.

From a ways back, Phoebe and Elise watch, squeezing hands.
CUT TO:
It’s won a BLUE RIBBON. Phoebe chats with a Judge.

JUDGE
What is this beautiful orchid? The
turquoise? What is it called?
Tremendous.

PHOEBE
I don’t think it has a name. We
have them up on a bit of land my
family has.

Elise watches from a distance. She shares a smile with
Phoebe.

JUDGE
It’s so easy, just a little
paperwork. In fact I’11 put you in
touch with a flora taxonomist I’ve
used that can walk you through it,

JUDGE (cont’d)
but hey if it is a new species they
let you name it after whoever found
it. You could have your very own
flower.

PHOEBE
It’d be my Granddad Walter’s then.
We’d name it after him. He used to
give them to my grandma when they
were courting.

Elise looks worried at this.

INT. CERULEAN PLAZA HOTEL/ LOBBY - NEXT - DAY

Phoebe enters with the ribbon, looks for Elise, and finds
her sitting at a table with a drink, solemn.

We focus on Elise’s ANKLES which are crossed tight. We stay
on them, the SOCKS.

CUT TO:

Phoebe takes a seat across from her trying to understand a
newfound tension between them. A WAITER stands nearby:

ELISE
She’1l have an iced tea.

PHOEBE
Diet coke.

Phoebe doesn’t get Elise’s stoic demeanor. She thinks it’s
the ribbon and slides it over.

PHOEBE (cont’d)
Take it. I don’t even...take it if
that’s what’s wron-

ELISE
We’re not going to name anything
after him.

Phoebe looks past her, trying to solve this.
ELISE (CONT’D)
Name it for yourself. Your mother.

Don’t name it. Doesn’t matter, not
him.

PHOEBE
Why, Gram?

Elise just stares back. There’s not going to be an answer.

PHOEBE (cont’d)
Gram.

Seconds pass.

PHOEBE (cont’d)
Gram.

And again. Brutal, quiet, haunting.
PHOEBE (cont’d)
Why?
INT. SIGN STORE/ BACK OFFICE - DAY
Kris speaks to her BOSS.
KRIS
I just don’t want to be, um,

sneaking around or saying I’m at
lunch when-

Boss
No, I think it’s great. It’s good
for you.

KRIS,
Yeah?

Boss
Of course. Who are you interviewing
with?

KRIS

I’m so glad. One does print design
and the other, which I think is a
better fit, is in post production.

FRONT AREA

Kris helps a CUSTOMER, retrieves an order from the counter:

KRIS (cont’d)
No, no I have them. Let me, here
they are. You put down 50 folders
but only 5 cover sheets and I
couldn’t reach you so...

CUSTOMER
Oh, thank you. You saved my life. I
don’t know what I- you’re a true
friend.

KRIS
Friend of human progress. You’re
welcome.

Customer doesn’t know what that means but gets out politely.
Kris is left embarrassed. What did I just say?

CUT TO:
She searches the phrase "friend of human progress" on her
phone. Up pops a listing for "WALDEN by Henry David
Thoreau".
She reads the full quote aloud:
KRIS (cont’d)
A true friend of man; almost the
only friend of human progress.
INT. BOOKSTORE - NEXT - DAY
She searches the shelves, pulls out a copy of Walden.
CUT TO:
Seated, she holds the copy open, looking off, having read
something that scares her a bit. She’s unsure what to do.

INT. CERULEAN PLAZA HOTEL/ ELEVATOR AREA - DAY

ELEVATOR DOORS open, revealing Wesley inside. He studies a
NOTEBOOK, unaware of the open doors until they almost close.

He puts up an arm to keep them open and exits.

INT. CERULEAN PLAZA HOTEL/ LOBBY - NEXT - DAY

He sits in a chair, still in his notebook. A young man,
VOLUNTEER, approaches:

VOLUNTEER
Mr. Van Kraus?

Wesley looks up.
Revision 1 83.

198 INT. SUV - NEXT - DAY
Volunteer drives. Wesley eyes the downtown high-rises.

VOLUNTEER
How do you like it?

Wesley isn’t sure what that means.
VOLUNTEER
I know you work, or you write I
mean, out of town. How do you find
the city?
WESLEY
It has its place.
199 INT. MUSIC HALL - NEXT - DAY
They enter on an upper level, looking out over the hall.
Wesley scans from the floor seats to the balconies.
WESLEY

They’ve refinished the second tier
there...at the exit.

VOLUNTEER
Yes sir. That was done end of last
year.

WESLEY
They use the same materials? Same
timber?

VOLUNTEER
Uh, great question. I’1l1 look into
that.

CUT TO:
Wesley sets up a GREY BOX on stage and steps away.
He hits a button on a REMOTE. A LOUD TONE emits from the
grey box, echoing against the back of the hall, dying down
after a few seconds. He turns his head and tests again.
CUT TO:
Again he tests the acoustics, this time from a floor seat.

CUT TO:
Revision 1 84.

One more test from the very back seat in the highest
balcony.

200 INT. REHEARSAL ROOM - DAY

Wesley directs a small group of Violinists rehearsing
PRECISE STACCATO BLASTS. He listens.

CUT TO:

He’s in a conversation with the most vocal one, LEAH (30):

WESLEY
This is- that’s exactly right...
LEAH
...but it leaves no room for
expression-
WESLEY

That’s exactly right. Your
complaint is exactly the right
thing to be complaining about.
Perfect. Strings have to be that.
Every. Loop. Perfect. No not
perfect, identical. However you
start has to be repeated forever
good or bad. Because over here with
choral and timber we’re organic and
we need a gauge, something to
contrast or it’s all just a moving
mess.

LEAH
Then use a metronome. Get a
synthesizer.

The other players are quiet. Leah might have crossed a line.
The room is tense. Wesley stays calm, even amused.

201 EXT. MUSIC HALL STEPS - NIGHT
The two sit alone, intimate. She takes a sip of his COFFEE:

WESLEY
We could do it artificially, throw
it to percussion et cetera. That
would be easy. The challenge is to
reproduce it in the analog. Remove
passion from where it shows up
naturally.

(CONTINUED)
202

203

CONTINUED: Revision 1 85.

LEAH
You can’t say it’s worth doing just
because it’s difficult. That’s
confusing two separate ideas. Were
you born into money? Rich people
always use the word challenge when
they want everyone else to do
something hard.

WESLEY
No, we weren’t rich.
LEAH
Poor?
WESLEY

Uh...it rose and fell with the

price of pork. My dad was a pig

farmer.

LEAH

No shit. Now it’s coming together.
INT. MUSIC HALL - DAY
Wesley conducts a FULL ORCHESTRA rehearsal on stage.
Among the violinists Leah plays with intense concentration.
A few seconds of CONTINUOUSLY HEIGHTENING NOTES before
Wesley stops the whole thing. He stares at the floor, the
room quiet.
He looks to Leah, but she already knows:

WESLEY
You’re done.

She packs up, walks off.

INT. CHAIN HOTEL/ CHECK-IN - NIGHT
Jeff passes through, gets almost to the elevators when...

CLERK

Jeff tears the wrapping, pausing for just a moment before
deciding to remove it entirely: a copy of WALDEN.

HOTEL ROOM
He sits on the edge of the bed, book open.

JEFF (OFF SCREEN)
There was something I didn’t
know...

INT. KRIS & JEFF’S HOUSE/ BEDROOM - NIGHT
Now on their bed, he struggles for words. Kris listens.

JEFF
...and I filled it with something I
made up and now I can’t tell the
difference. But if none of it’s
true, if it’s all a fiction I
built...something has to go in its
place...or how are we meant to...

KRIS
All you have to say is you don’t
know.

His eyes water. He looks like he may say it.

INT. KRIS & JEFF’S HOUSE/ BEDROOM - MORNING
Kris wakes, sits up in bed, about to stand, takes a moment.

The ALARM CLOCK flips to "5:28" and the radio turns on. An
ad for a symphony plays accompanied by STRIKING CHORDS:

ANNOUNCER (RADIO)
This fall...the KL Symphony
Orchestra marks the beginning of
its 75th season. A gala event
featuring the highly anticipated
return of-

She shuts it off instinctively. Then after a moment...

Tickets available now.
Jeff steps from the bathroom with a toothbrush in his mouth,
stunned and listening.
INT. MUSIC HALL - NIGHT
The orchestra is WARMING UP.
Jeff and Kris sit on the third row. She reads the PROGRAM:
we see the title "REPETICO", "Composer Wesley Van Kraus",
and on a dedication page "For Becky, my life."

Jeff, staring ahead, suddenly turns to the audience behind
them. Kris senses it too: something is out there.

APPLAUSE wakes them and they turn to the stage where Wesley
steps out, bowing slightly. He scans the audience, the
balcony, his eyes lingering too long. He senses something
too.

Wesley raises the BATON. A moment of silence.

He thrusts it. The music begins softly but we only see...
MICROSCOPIC CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL REACTIONS. The TURQUOISE
POWDER effervesces against the surface of an ORGANELLE
before disappearing inside. BLOOD FLOWS, carrying the
powder.

After fading to an echo, the music returns with a CRESCENDO:

Kris feels the effects, looking like an invisible hand is
slowly pushing her over. She almost loses consciousness.

Jeff is breathing hard, trying to withstand the spell they
seem to be under. He braces against the armrests.

Kris tries to stand. Jeff helps her. They move to the aisle.

As they walk to the back exit, they notice a MAN in the
audience on the right get up, moving to the aisle.

A WOMAN stands on their left.

Then an OLDER COUPLE, all joining them in exiting.
207

208

Revision 1 88.

INT. MUSIC HALL/ FOYER - NEXT - NIGHT

Kris, Jeff, and 9 OTHER ABDUCTEES are assembled in a group.
They look to each other, searching faces while the music
plays on, muffled through DOUBLE DOORS.

Kris notices that one of the men, GRAHAM, lingers near the
door. He presses his head to it, listening. A young woman,
DOROTHY, follows too, leaning against the other door. One by
one they move into the doorway huddled together in a trance.

Kris joins them, letting go of Jeff’s hand. He resists,
covering his ears. He backs away, headed outside.

APPLAUSE ERUPTS. The symphony is over. Doors open. The
audience files out.
EXT. MUSIC HALL - NEXT - NIGHT

Jeff walks around the back of the building. He pulls on an
unmarked door. Locked. He moves on.

He tests another door. Locked.

He heads toward a fleet of BLACK TOWN CARS parked on the
street. After scanning them he gets back to testing doors.

He runs his hand along the wall. An ELECTRIC CABLE is
affixed to it. On a hunch, he reaches out to it, sensing
something...

He turns just before a door 20 feet back BANGS OPEN. Wesley
exits with Volunteer, crossing to one of the Town Cars.

Jeff rushes to him. For a brief moment Wesley recognizes him
before ducking into the car. Jeff rubs his throat: the
collar.

JEFF
You know me.

Wesley turns to him as the car door closes. He drives off.

JEFF (cont’d)
You know me!
209

Revision 1 89.

INT. MUSIC HALL/ FOYER - NEXT - NIGHT

Kris is still with the abductees. She steps to Jeff as he
approaches. He’s stunned, almost smiling:

JEFF
He saw me. He looked at me. He
knows me.

This excites her. She’s thinking of a next step.

EXT. RURAL ROAD NEAR REFINERY - NEXT - NIGHT

THREE CARS idle at the fork, parallel to each other.
Inside all 11 abductees silently write on index cards.

The cards are passed from car to car to car. Kris tallies:

KRIS
Seven lefts. Four rights.

The cars drive off down the leftmost road.

CUT TO:
Next fork. Another vote. They take off right.
CUT TO:
KRIS (cont’d)
Five left. Six right.
MILTON
Again? Why’s it so close?
CUT TO:
Another vote.
KRIS.
Six to the left.
DOROTHY
It shouldn’t count if it’s that
close. If there were twelve of us
it’d be a tie.
CUT TO:

Another fork. They continue.

Revision 1 90.

EXT. GAS STATION - NEXT - NIGHT

Cars gas up. People are tired. They split off into small
chats. Dorothy shakes her head, despondent. Keith checks his
watch, yawning. The mood is dour.

Brent and Jeff confer over a road map:

BRENT
I wouldn’t call it a circle, but if
we are going somewhere this would
be the longest possible route to
it.

Carol flips through the votes, comparing, finds something
odd.

CUT TO:
She walks to Kris with the cards.
CAROL
Kris? You’re Kris? Will you look at
this?
CUT TO:

Kris marches angrily to an OLD COUPLE, NORA and CLYDE:

KRIS
What are you people doing!?

They stare back, dumbfounded. Kris holds up index cards:
KRIS
What’s wrong with you?! Why are you
wrecking it? Why are you always the
same? Every single vote you guys
agree. Even when you’re wrong you
agree!
They have no answer. Kris turns to Clyde:

KRIS,
Show me your ankle. Right now.

CLYDE
What for?

CUT TO:

He sits. She crouches, pulls down his sock, and sees the
scar.

(CONTINUED)
212

CONTINUED: Revision 1 91.

Satisfied, she turns to Nora:

KRIS
You. Come on. Show me.

Nora doesn’t move, obstinate. She looks to Clyde for help.

KRIS
You’re not one of us. Are you?

Nora refuses to answer.

CLYDE
Nora?

NORA
It happened to Clyde so it happened
to me.

Kris, furious, SLAPS Nora. Jeff pulls her off.
JEFF
Kris. Kris. It’s just a story. She
just made a story.

EXT. RURAL ROAD - NIGHT

The cars idle. Index cards are passed in. Brent tallies.
Keith leans in the window to see how things are going:

BRENT
Eight to two, seven to three...nine
to one. Last one was unanimous, an
even ten.
Keith gets back in his car, announces:
KEITH
Good votes. Think we’re getting
close.
The cars drive off.

Kris, in the front passenger seat, senses something, turns
around, scans each face, lands on Graham. What is it?

He’s lost in his own world, staring at the door. Ominous.

Kris sees that Carol also feels something from Graham.

Revision 1 92.

EXT. WESLEY’S FARMHOUSE - NEXT - DAWN

The 3 cars wind down the country road towards the house.

INT. WESLEY’S FARMHOUSE/ KITCHEN - NEXT - DAWN

Wesley eats toast over his morning paper at the counter.
Hearing VOICES, he turns to see the abductees out front.
They are huddled together, trying to decide something.
Recognizing them, he’s a bit surprised but not unhappy. He
cleans up his breakfast, tucks in his shirt, and moves
toward the front of the house, looking to welcome them.

EXT. WESLEY’S FARMHOUSE - NEXT - DAWN

On the edge of the group Carol stares at the pigpen. Kris
follows her gaze and ends up staring too.

There is a faint discussion about what to do next but it
dies down, as one by one they all turn, drawn in.

Kris steps first and before long the group is walking toward
the pen, everyone but Graham who is nowhere to be seen.

Suddenly Kris stops, turns back to the house.

We hear a GUNSHOT. The group turns to the house.

ANOTHER GUNSHOT, the MUZZLE FLASHES inside the house.
Wesley CRASHES through the front door and falls to the
ground, escaping from Graham who follows him, GUN
outstretched.

Stunned silence. They all watch Wesley crawl, slowly die.

Jeff moves to disarm Graham but Kris stops him. She knows:

KRIS
Wait.

Graham puts the gun to the roof of his mouth.

Revision 1 93.

EXT. PIGPEN - CONTINUOUS - DAWN

A pig BUCKLES to the ground just as Graham, in the far
background, pulls the trigger and COLLAPSES himself.
INT. WESLEY’S FARMHOUSE - NEXT - DAY

The abductees move through the house, silently looking.

INT. LIVESTOCK BUILDING/ WHITE ROOM - NEXT - DAY
The cot is still there. Clean linen. Well lit.
They file in like they’re touring an historic landmark.

When the others leave, Carol can’t tear herself away.

INT. LIVESTOCK BUILDING/ EXAM ROOM - NEXT - DAY

They crowd around the desk studying Wesley’s notes,
sketches, the CLIPBOARD of abductees’ names.

Kris scrolls to the top of the list to the only one without
a last name...

KRIS
Becky.
EXT. PIGPEN - DAY
The abductees spread out into the pen.
Kris walks alone, slowly but directly, to K. She crouches.
JEFF approaches holding the clipboard. He compares K’s tag:

JEFF
It’s you.

Kris wells up, it finally hitting her that she’s not crazy.

KRIS
I know.

Beyond them, the others are finding their matching pigs.

Revision 1 94.

EXT. YELLOW PIGPEN - DAWN

The pigs empty out of a LIVESTOCK TRAILER into a large pen
surrounded by an AGED YELLOW-PAINTED FENCE.

Nora and Clyde wrangle them while other abductees continue
repairs on the fence, replacing decay with new lumber.

A TRUCK arrives on the road. On the side is painted "’No man
should be allowed to be President who does not understand
hogs.’ - President Harry Truman". A NEW VET emerges.

Carol greets her, leads her alongside an OLD YELLOW
FARMHOUSE.

INT. YELLOW FARMHOUSE - DAY

The place is DUSTY, seemingly abandoned for decades. Brent
has to practically knock the door down to get in. He carries
BOXES of Wesley’s sketches and notes, which he stacks in the
corner.

He looks around at their new workplace.

EXT. YELLOW FARMHOUSE - DAY
Over a picnic-table lunch, they all question New Vet:

CLYDE
How much space is ideal for them?
Do they roam? Would they rather
have smaller pens but more of them
if that makes sense-

CUT TO:
NORA
-so I thought we’d mix in a lot of
fresh produce, vitamin supplements,
a lot of whole grains. Is that
right?
CUT TO:

DOROTHY
-no, I’d prefer to keep them
groomed, get them bathed every
other day but if the natural
instinct- I mean if they like being
shaggy I don’t want to just force-

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

Revision 1 95.

CUT TO:

SELMA
Do the women, the sows I mean, ever
separate off? Do they like being
mixed in all the time? I would
think-

MILTON
That reminds me...when it does get
colder...at what temperature do we
need to start thinking about maybe
an indoor pen? Space heaters and
you know...

CUT TO:

KEITH
All of them, yeah. We just-
whatever vaccines are available.
All of them. All the shots.

NEW VET
This is a list of recommended
vaccines and I’1l certainly inspect
each animal. The truth is you can
defend against all manner of
disease, make them healthy as can
be. But at some point the cost
outweighs what you hope to recoup
at slaughter.

The abductees share a look.

CAROL
Let me stop you. Don’t worry about
cost. These pigs are going to be
better cared for than most people’s
kids. It’s going to be
embarrassing. Now. If they could
choose anything...what is it that
they really love to eat?

New Vet looks around the table: is this a joke? Finally she

just goes

with it and laughs...

NEW VET
Okay.

Revision 1 96.

EXT. YELLOW PIGPEN - DAY
New Vet feels K’s belly, confirming pregnancy:
NEW VET
Oh goodness, yes. And far along
too.

Kris is overjoyed, roaring with laughter.

INT. YELLOW FARMHOUSE - DAY

Brent reads names from the clipboard then Carol searches
them online. They confer on phone numbers. Brent calls:

BRENT (ON PHONE)
Yes, is this Marsha Potter? My name
is Brent West. I have...some
information that...I hope might
help you.

EXT. YELLOW FARMHOUSE - DAY

A CAR drives up. HUSBAND (the one whose wife died) gets out,
checks the address against his handwritten note.

He walks toward the house as Jeff opens the door for him.

EXT. CREEK/ DRAINAGE DITCH - DAY

Elise and Phoebe scout for orchids. Elise is frail now and
walks with a cane, slowing their progress. Again we spend
too much time trying to see her ankles, still socked.

Phoebe has to leave her to step down the incline to the
white orchids we have seen before. She scans for the
turquoise.

She calls back up to Elise:
PHOEBE
Gram, there’s none here either.
Maybe further up? Should I grab
white?

She turns upstream, still hopeful.
228

Revision 1 97.

EXT. PLANT NURSERY - DAY

Evan is shopping for the orchids, checking leaves like
before. He looks all around, not finding them.

Peter, trying to help, brings him a candidate. Evan scrapes
the leaf with a knife but doesn’t like the residue.

He grabs a bit of soil to be sure, checking for worms. No
luck so he tosses it and looks elsewhere. Peter follows,
learning.

EXT. YELLOW PIGPEN - DUSK

Kris sits against the fence, content.

She holds a newborn PIGLET, lifting it to her face like
she’s playing with a baby.

All around her K’s other PIGLETS clumsily explore.
