EXT. ZOO’S TIGER AREA - NIGHT

We hear a baby crying and discover it is a newborn tiger. The
MOTHER TIGER cuddles the child, but he is inconsolable.

The FATHER TIGER approaches, annoyed.

FATHER TIGER
Any change?

MOTHER TIGER
Hmm... well, let me see.

She sarcastically holds the crying baby to her ear.

MOTHER TIGER
He’s still crying.

FATHER TIGER
Well can’t you do something?

MOTHER TIGER
Can't you?

FATHER TIGER
(menacing)
I don’t think you’d like my idea.

Suddenly the baby quiets, as if he understood the threat.

JEFFERSON (0.S.)
A-hem.

The tigers look up. Sitting in a tree overhead is JEFFERSON,
a chimpanzee.

JEFFERSON
Sorry to interrupt. I couldn’t help
overhearing.

FATHER TIGER
Funny how eavesdropping can lead to
that.
Jefferson climbs down and sits with them.
JEFFERSON
As a concerned fellow prisoner, I
can’t help but point out the obvious.

MOTHER TIGER
Obvious what?

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
JEFFERSON
You two were born in the wild. He’s
first-generation captivity. Your
instincts don’t apply here. Not
behind bars.

FATHER TIGER
Would you excuse us? This is a
family matter.

JEFFERSON
But it’s also a larger, society
matter.

MOTHER TIGER
What do you suggest we do?

FATHER TIGER
Jefferson doesn’t have suggestions.
Only complaints.

JEFFERSON
They're observations. Much needed
observations, I might add. And I
can’t possibly fix our situation
alone. It will take the combined
effort of all the animals to gain
our freedom.

FATHER TIGER
Ridiculous.

JEFFERSON
Can't you see? Being locked in these
cages is robbing us of not just our
dignity, but our very being. The fact
that you can’t bond with your son is
the perfect example --

The Father Tiger ROARS in anger, causing the baby to start
crying again. Jefferson freezes in fear.

FATHER TIGER
We’re not an example of anything -
especially your political nonsense.
Now leave us alone.

MOTHER TIGER
(to baby)
There, there. Everything’s alright.

Jefferson climbs back up the tree, still frightened, but
truly sorry that he didn’t help.

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
EXT. ZOO PATHWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Jefferson walking, concerned. Down from a nearby tree comes
ROSS, a fast-talking, female babboon.

ROSS
Hey - how'd it go? Did you help?
Did they listen? Are they going to
join the fight for freedom?

JEFFERSON
Badly. No. No. And no.

ROSS
Don’t give up. It’s a long fight.
You said so yourself.

JEFFERSON
Thanks, Ross.

ROSS
Can I help? How can I help?

Jefferson perks up a bit, and stares ahead with conviction.

JEFFERSON
Rally in the square.

Ross’ face lights up.

ROSS
You mean it?

JEFFERSON
You bet I do.

He walks ahead. Still smiling, she heads the other way.

EXT. ZOO PATHWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Ross passes a RHINO, a GAZELLE and a FLAMINGO hanging out by
a closed-up souvenir cart. Without stopping, she tells them:

ROSS
Rally in the square.

They roll their eyes, but after a moment, they follow her.

MONTAGE: Ross spreading the word to several different animals
that there’s going to be a:

ROSS
Rally in the square.

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
They all react with the same annoyed boredom, but comply.

EXT. ZOO SQUARE - NIGHT
A sectioned-off, mini ampitheater used for kids’ shows.

As thirty or so animals lazily file in, Ross directs the
seating as if handling a riot.

ROSS
Okay, easy does it. No shoving.
There’s plenty of room for
everyone. Smaller animals down to
the front. Larger folks to the
back, please.

Working with Ross is FRANKLIN, a slacker, teenage spider
monkey. He mimics Ross, pointing animals in whatever
direction she has already established for them.

When a pair of bats appear at the entrance, Ross immediately
pays special attention to them.

ROSS
(to bats)
Right this way, sir. Miss. -- or is
it Mrs.? Ms. probably. You look
like a Ms.
(to others)

Excuse us. Visually challenged
guests coming through. Make way,
please.

(to bats)
You’1l be down in front here.

(to others)
Excuse us. Pardon us. Make way for
the visually challenged.

Unable to get by the rhino, Ross snaps at him.

ROSS
Hey, a little respect here, huh?

When everyone is in place, Jefferson ascends the stage. He
has pages of notes in his hand and seems confident --

-- Until he looks out at the moderately-sized crowd.

JEFFERSON
Umm... uuhhh... tonight

(gulp)
I just wanted to, um....

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
The crowd groans. They saw this coming. Jefferson starts
sweating.

JEFFERSON
No, wait. I just. it’s just...
what we need is ...um, ...

 

From the side, Ross desperately roots for him, trying to will
him the courage to succeed. Franklin stands beside her, more
confused than anything.

JEFFERSON
There’s this .... um... You see...
(defeated)
Sorry. Thanks for coming.

Jefferson slinks off the stage and sits on a nearby bench.
The animals file out shaking their heads.

CLOSE ON: The Rhino.

RHINO
(sarcastic)
Gee, didn’t see that coming.

CLOSE ON: two GIRAFFES filing out.

GIRAFFE 1
Tell me again why we do this.

GIRAFFE 2
Because if we don’t come as a
group, he’ll come to each of our
cages and talk for hours.

Ross runs to Jefferson who sits quietly staring ahead.
Franklin follows close behind her.

ROSS
You did good! That was real...
progress, I thought.
(to Franklin)
Didn't he do good, Franklin?

FRANKLIN
Kinda the same as last time. And
the time before that. And the --

Ross smacks the back of his head with her tail.

ROSS
(to Jefferson)
It’s not your fault. It’s a
disorder called groupatalkaphobia.
(MORE )

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
ROSS (cont'd)

Instead of blaming the victim, we,
as a society, should get you the
help you need.

She holds his shoulders.
ROSS (CONT'D)
We will get through this, and
everyone will join the cause.

Franklin looks around their setting.

FRANKLIN
You think everyone would fit in here?

Jefferson starts to hyperventilate at the thought.

ROSS
Nice going. Quick! Get a paper bag!

Franklin darts off. Jefferson is trying to say something.

JEFFERSON
Lin ---- Linc-- .... L1111 ---

ROSS
It’s going to be fine. You don’t
need him. I’m here. It’s okay.

Franklin returns with a popcorn bag. Ross gives it to
Jefferson, who sucks air from it and starts CHOKING.

Ross pulls the bag away and POPCORN FLIES everywhere. She
glares at Franklin.

ROSS
An empty bag, you nitwit!

Ross does the Heimlich on Jefferson by wrapping her tail
around his waist and grabbing it with one hand.

It works. Jefferson coughs up popcorn kernels and breathes
again. But his eyes stay staring ahead, almost catatonic.

FRANKLIN
Why don’t we just find his brother?

ROSS
Because no one knows where he is.

FRANKLIN
Don’t you think that’s weird?
Disappearing for two hours every
night.

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
ROSS
Yes. But that’s Lincoln. He’s
weird. We’1ll just have to wait for
him to come back from ... wherever.

FRANKLIN
Just like last time...
EXT. ZOO WALKWAYS - NIGHT
Quiet and dark.
FRANKLIN (CONT’D - O.S.)
-.. and the time before that. And
the time before that.
We track along a perimeter fence. SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC slowly
builds as we approach an unknown building and track INTO an
exhaust vent in the exterior wall.
INT. AIR VENTS —- CONTINUOUS
Continuing track as music builds. Faint voices can be heard
in the distance, coming from somewhere in the building and

traveling through the vents. Their volume steadily increases.

GOOD GUY (0.S.)
You'll never get away with this.

BAD GUY (0.S.)
We'll see about that.

We hear the rumbling of a fight as we turn a corner.

A spooky blue glow flickers throughout this 15-feet of air
vent. The light comes from a grate at the end of the tunnel.
Sitting in front of the grate, his back to us, is another
chimp, Jefferson’s brother LINCOLN.

TRACK IN over Lincoln’s shoulder and we see what he sees:

INT. SECURITY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

The only light in the room comes from a 20-inch TV in one
corner. A lazy, film-geek GUARD (early 20s) sits in the desk
chair, intently watching a 1970s cop movie.

He is unaware of Lincoln, who is also transfixed by the film.

CLOSE ON: TV SCREEN

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
The two men have finished their fight. The Bad Guy has the
Good Guy pinned to a wall.

GOOD GUY
The police know about your scheme.
They’re on their way right now.

BAD GUY
I got news for you...

CLOSE ON: Lincoln, watching.

BAD GUY (0.S.)
«+. the police work for me.

Lincoln’s eyes go wide, surprised by the revelation.
BAD GUY (CONT’D)
And your friends won't be bothering
me any more. I’ve seen to that.

GOOD GUY (0.S.)
You .... animal!

Taken from the moment, Lincoln rolls his eyes with a “yeah,
yeah” look, then reacts in inspired awe as we HEAR the Good
Guy escape and the forces of good take over.

BAD GUY
No!! Ahhhgggghhh!!!

GOOD GUY
That’1l teach you to operate on the
wrong side of the law.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. SECURITY OFFICE - 10 MINUTES LATER
Still on a satisfied Lincoln, we hear theme music and see the
scrolling credits reflected in his still-focused eyes.
EXT. ZOO SQUARE - LATE NIGHT
Ross tries to console a still anxiety-ridden Jefferson while
Franklin tosses a rock in the air and tries unsuccessfully to
bat it with a stick.
Lincoln approaches the trio.
LINCOLN
Hi guys. What’s up?

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
ROSS
We had another rally.
LINCOLN
How'd it go?
FRANKLIN
Same as last time... and the --
ROSS
Alright!
LINCOLN

Thanks for watching him. I’1l take
it from here.

Ross reluctantly makes room for Lincoln, who puts his arm
around Jefferson, who is visibly calmer with Lincoln there.

ROSS
Good night, Jefferson. See you
tomorrow.

Jefferson just nods as he and Lincoln walk off.

EXT. ZOO WALKWAY - NIGHT
Lincoln and Jefferson walking. Jefferson is a bit calmer.

LINCOLN
It’s just nerves. Public speaking
just isn’t your thing.

JEFFERSON
How can I be a political leader if
I can’t face a bunch of friends in
a familiar place?

LINCOLN
I’m not sure a political leader is
what’s needed here.

JEFFERSON
That's because you’re oblivious to
the oppression.

They get to their cage. Lincoln takes a key from under a
“hide-a-key” fake rock and unlocks the door.

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
10.

INT. MONKEY CAGE - CONTINUOUS

JEFFERSON (CONT'D)
No one takes me seriously.

LINCOLN
That’s because you take yourself
too seriously. Did you ever think
of that?

JEFFERSON
We have an obligation to the animals
who aren’t as smart as we are.

LINCOLN
An obligation to do what?

JEFFERSON
To better our situation. You want
to spend the rest of your life in
this cage? We’re prisoners! And
everyone is too blind to see it.

LINCOLN
No one is blind --
(to himself)

Well, except the bats.

(back to Jefferson)
Look. We’re here. We’re fed. We’re
taken care of. We have doctors, for
crying out loud. Kids love us.

JEFFERSON
Their kids.

LINCOLN
There’s nothing we can do about it.
All your activism. Do you really
think you can achieve equal rights
for zoo animals?

JEFFERSON
See how they brainwash you? There
shouldn't be any such thing as a
zoo animal. We’re just animals.
They're responsible for the zoo

part.
LINCOLN
So we should -- what?
JEFFERSON
Unite! Rise up! Take our freedom
back!

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
11.

LINCOLN
That’s impossible.

JEFFERSON
Nothing’s impossible.

LINCOLN
You can’t win.

JEFFERSON
So you should only fight if you
know you can win?

LINCOLN
Ummm...Kinda - yeah.

JEFFERSON
That’s some life philosophy. Remind
me to write that down sometime so
I‘1ll never forget it.

Disappointed, Jefferson slinks off to a dark corner.

LINCOLN
Jefferson, I --

JEFFERSON (0.S.)
-- good night.

Lincoln sighs, knowing this talk is over - for tonight.

EXT. ZOO MAIN GATE - MORNING

A beautiful, sunny day. Throngs of people enter the gates.
Kids run ahead of bag-holding, stroller-pushing parents.

Looking out of place in this crowd is ETHAN LATTE. A pale,
thin artist-poser-type, Ethan is bald, has a goatee and is
dressed all in black: turtleneck, sunglasses and blazer --
even though it’s obviously hot out.

Ethan talks on a cell phone as he walks.

ETHAN
That’s not going to happen. We’re
shooting the scene just as I wrote
it. Tell them that Ethan Latte
doesn’t compromise his art for
anything. -- Look, I’m in the
middle of something here. Kind of a
blind date. Never mind where. I’1l
call you back.

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
12.

He flips his phone closed. As the crowd disperses in
different directions, we see that Ethan is with an attractive
single MOM in her thirties and her 7-year-old DAUGHTER.

The daughter runs ahead. Ethan does little to hide his
disdain for this outing.

MOM
All set?
ETHAN
Yes, let’s ... zoo.
MOM

Sorry again about the mix-up. She
really is supposed to be with her
father today. It’s really nice of
you to come along.

Ethan takes out a DV camera and checks the gauges.

ETHAN
Uh-huh.

While looking through the lens to test light, Ethan steps in
something, soiling his expensive, trendy shoes.

The leather shoes have distinctive ORANGE TIPS.
ETHAN
(to himself)
Wonderful.

EXT. CHIMP AREA - 10 MINUTES LATER

Ethan and the Mom approach the daughter, who hangs on the
fence, trying to engage the chimps.

MOM
My sister says you make movies.
That’s interes--.

ETHAN
-- Films. I make films. Movies have
clichés and car chases.

Lincoln hears this exchange, perks up and comes down to sit
closer to them.

MOM
I see. And what do your films have?

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
13.

ETHAN
Meaningful stories. Strong,
conflicted characters. Redeeming
social commentary. See the

difference?
MOM
Uh ... sure.

She is annoyed at his arrogance, but tries to make the best
of it, for her daughter’s sake.

MOM
I used to see lots of movies. All
kids’ stuff these days, though.

ETHAN
Mmm-hmm. I have a film selected in
the Moonsong Film Festival.

The mom rolls her eyes and sips from a water bottle. Lincoln
listens intently.

MOM
That’s nice. Is that like a contest
or something?

Ethan lets out a condescending laugh.
ETHAN
It’s only the biggest independent
film showcase in the world. You get
recognized there and you can write
your own ticket in Hollywood, baby.

In the middle of another water sip, she nearly chokes on
Ethan's “baby.” She’s about to lean into him when:

DAUGHTER (0.S.)
Look, mom! He likes me!

The daughter is up on the monkey cage railing, leaning over.

MOM
Honey, don’t climb on that.

She scurries ahead and helps her daughter down.
DAUGHTER

(whispers)
That Ethan guy is weird.

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
14.

MOM
That’s actually one of his better
qualities.

She turns back to Ethan, who is again talking on his cell
phone, and checking himself out in the glass reflection of
another section of the monkey area.

Lincoln comes up to the glass and mimics an oblivious Ethan.
The mom and daughter laugh. Ethan hangs up.

MOM

Can you get a shot of us?
ETHAN

A ... shot?
MOM

Yeah. Take some video of us in
front of the monkeys.

ETHAN
What would be the point of that?

MOM
To remember what great fun we had
at the zoo.
Ethan sighs, checks his camera, the sunlight, and. .

CUT TO:

20 MINUTES LATER

Ethan has set up an elaborate shoot, with barriers to hold
patrons back - until he cues them to walk past as extras.

Lincoln watches, riveted. The mom and daughter are MORTIFIED
as Ethan calls to them:

ETHAN
Again! .... and action!

The mom and daughter smile awkwardly and wave at the camera.

ETHAN
Don’t wave! ... Define the moment!
Share the moment! Be the moment ...
Don’t react! Act!

 

During the shooting, Lincoln holds his fingers up and frames
the mom and daughter. His composition is better than Ethan's.

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
15.

ETHAN
(groans)
Cut! Must you be so stiff?

MOM
Okay, look, we should really be
getting home.

ETHAN
I was only trying to say something
with the film.

MOM
You said plenty. Thanks. It’s been
areal... treat. I’1l be sure to

thank my sister for setting us up.

She takes her daughter’s hand. As they walk away, the
daughter looks back.

DAUGHTER
Bye - freak!

Ethan erases the footage and turns to leave, but realizes he
has no idea which way the exit is.

EXT. CROCODILE PIT - 40 MINUTES LATER

Tired and sweating, Ethan is still trying to find the exit.
He sits on a bench, puts his camera down and tries to make a
cell phone call. No reception.

Frustrated, he gets up quickly, knocking his camera into the
crocodile pit. It lands, intact, in a bush. MIKEY, the

crocodile immediately eyes it.

Ethan starts to climb in. MIKEY moves, and Ethan thinks
better of it and calls out.

ETHAN
Excuse me! A little help here! I
need to speak with a zoo employee.

A small crowd gathers around the yelling Ethan.
INT. MONKEY CAGE - CONTINUOUS

Lincoln is relaxing in a hammock when BRAD, a free-flying
bird lands nearby.

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
16.

LINCOLN
What’s all the commotion over
there? Did Mikey eat someone?

BRAD
Nah. Some guy dropped his video
camera in the pit.

LINCOLN
(perks )
Really?

BRAD
Yeah. No big --

LINCOLN
-- Get to Mikey. Quick! Tell him --

Suddenly, a family is at Lincoln's cage, peering in, so he
slyly whispers something to Brad, who shrugs and flies off.

Now watched by the family, Lincoln scratches himself and
swings on the hammock.

EXT. ZOO CROC PIT - MOMENTS LATER

Ethan with a portly ZOOKEEPER who takes his job very
seriously, gesturing dramatically with his hands as he speaks.

ETHAN
Can’t you just climb down there?
Isn't that your job?!

ZOOKEEPER
Not exactly, sir. But we can lure
the croc back inside - there - to
create a safe path - here - from
which we can retrieve your personal
belonging.

ETHAN
How long will that take?

ZOOKEEPER
Well, croc manipulation is by no
Means an exact science, but I can
assure you we will do our best to
retrieve your personal belonging.

Brad lands on Mikey’s head and whispers something to him. The
croc looks puzzled at him. Brad just shrugs.

Suddenly, the croc moves for the camera.

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
17.

ETHAN
He’s moving! He’s going to it! Do
something!

ZOOKEEPER
He’s just exhibiting instinctive
behavior. Crocs are naturally very
curious. An often overlooked fact
about the giant reptile.

ETHAN
He’s going to eat it!

ZOOKEEPER
(chuckles )
Oh, I doubt that, sir. He’s not
like a shark. If it’s not food or
food-smelling, he’1ll just --

Suddenly the croc opens its jaws and eats the camera.

ZOOKEEPER
-- well, hoo-dee-dumpkin. There's
somethin’ you don’t see every day.

Ethan doesn’t know whether to lash out or weep.

ETHAN
Your filthy, wretched zoo is going
to pay for that.

ZOOKEEPER
I'm afraid the zoo is not
responsible for personal belongings
lost, stolen or damaged during your
visit. Your admittance ticket is
also a contract --

ETHAN
Oh, shut up!

He storms off, but not necessarily in the right direction, so
he stops and turns back.

ETHAN
How do I get out of here!?

ZOOKEEPER
Oh that’s easy. Down to the
giraffes, turn right, through the
tunnel and around the flamingo
garden. If ya see hippos, you've
gone too far!

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
18.

ETHAN
How utterly....easy!

ZOOKEEPER
Enjoy the rest of your stay, sir.

Ethan storms off.
Mikey sits motionless in his pit

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. CROCODILE PIT - NIGHT
Mikey still motionless. He hasn’t moved.

LINCOLN (0.S.)
Bravo.

Lincoln climbs down next to Mikey and holds out his hand.

LINCOLN
Let’s have it.

Mikey opens his jaws, revealing the camera, perfectly intact.
Lincoln reaches, but Mikey CLAMPS shut.

Lincoln pulls his hand away just in time.

LINCOLN
Was that supposed to be funny?

Mikey’s talk is dumb-sounding with the camera in his mouth.

MIKEY
What’s in it for me?

LINCOLN
Nothing.

MIKEY

Well that’s not good enough.

Lincoln sighs and looks around. He expected this to be a
short visit.

LINCOLN
What would you like?

MIKEY
I don’t know.

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
19.

LINCOLN
Haven't you had quite a bit of time
to think about it?

MIKEY
I guess.

LINCOLN
How about some food?

MIKEY
Okay.

LINCOLN

Okay. You give me the camera, and
I'll see to it that that rock over
there has food on it first thing in
the morning.

MIKEY
Stuff I like?

LINCOLN
Absolutely. Right by that little
door over there. How’s eight
o'clock?

Mikey thinks about it and finally sticks his tongue out, the
camera sitting on it. Lincoln takes the slimy camera and
wipes it off as best he can.

INT. MONKEY CAGE - LATER

Lincoln is testing the camera, learning its features, when
Jefferson comes in.

JEFFERSON
And just what do you plan on doing
with that?

LINCOLN

Make a movie, write my own ticket
to Hollywood and get recognized at
the Moonsong Film Festival.

JEFFERSON
What? The Moon-who what festival?

Lincoln imitates Ethan, but just to amuse himself.
LINCOLN

It’s only the biggest independent
film showcase in the world, baby.

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
20.

JEFFERSON
When are you going to stop playing
and get serious?

Lincoln points the camera at his brother.
LINCOLN
Who's playing? C’mon, pout - oh,
you're already pouting.

JEFFERSON
Very funny.

LINCOLN
Okay, funny. Funny is good. If only
we had a banana peel.

Jefferson laughs. Lincoln is stunned.

LINCOLN
Was that a laugh?
JEFFERSON
No.
LINCOLN
Yes it was. I have it on tape.
JEFFERSON
It wasn’t on.
LINCOLN
But I saw it. ... It’s not a crime,

you know. Laughing.

JEFFERSON
I know.
LINCOLN
(joking)

But don’t let me see it again! This
is serious business! I am an arteest!

JEFFERSON
And I'm going to bed.

He goes to his corner.
LINCOLN
Fine, be that way. But you’ll never
work in this town again!
JEFFERSON (0.S.)
What?

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
21.
LINCOLN
Never mind. Good night.

Lincoln fiddles some more with the camera.

EXT. ZOO SQUARE ENTRANCE - LATE EVENING

A long line of animals waits to get in.

EXT. ZOO SQUARE STAGE —- CONTINUOUS
Lincoln points the camera at us, looking out from one side.

LINCOLN
Okay, this is called a screen test.

Opposite him is a FLAMINGO holding a sheet of paper.

FLAMINGO
You want us to talk?

LINCOLN
Yeah.

FLAMINGO

And humans are gonna see this?

LINCOLN
It’s okay. Animals talk in movies
all the time. Just read the lines.
The important thing is to relax and
have fun.

He looks back into the camera. The flamingo opens his mouth
to speak and Lincoln cuts him off:

LINCOLN (0.S.)
And remember - you just discovered
you have a horrible disease and
that your children are actually
aliens from outer space.

The flamingo’s face goes blank. He looks down at the page and
then back up at Lincoln.

LINCOLN (0.S.)
Whenever you’re ready...

The flamingo can only manage a GULP and a GRUNT.

MONTAGE: SCREEN TESTS - NIGHT

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
22.

We see various zoo animals through Lincoln's camera frame.
A male rhino:

RHINO
(deadpan )
You'll never take me alive,
coppers.

LINCOLN (0.S.)
Good. Try it again, a little
tougher. You’re mean. Everyone’s
afraid of you.

RHINO
(identical deadpan)
You'll never take me alive,
coppers.
A female gazelle:

GAZELLE
I know you don’t lose me anymore.

LINCOLN (0.S.)
Love.

GAZELLE
What?

LINCOLN
You don’t love me anymore.

GAZELLE
I never loved you. We’re not even
the same species-- That’s disgust--
oh! The line. Sorry. I get it.

A male OTTER stands silent for a beat, then suddenly looks
scared and points to the sky:

OTTER
Look out!!!!

Lincoln looks up from his camera, and checks his script.

LINCOLN
That was good, but the line is --

BONK! Lincoln gets hit on the head with a falling pine cone.

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
23.

EXT. ZOO SQUARE - AN HOUR LATER

The tests are done. Lincoln starts packing up and sees Ross,
watching curiously. She’s conflicted throughout the scene.

LINCOLN
Oh, hey Ross. Didn’t see you there.
C’mon down. Thanks for waiting.

ROSS
(dreamy )
Me?
(catches herself)
Oh, no. I’m not here to be part of
this movie thing.

She moves in closer to Lincoln, unable to hide her
fascination with the camera.

LINCOLN
No?

ROSS
I’m here to scold you. Playing with
human people toys when they lock --
(points)
What does that do?

LINCOLN
It zooms the picture closer. Wanna
see?

ROSS
Of course not! -- okay.

Lincoln smiles and lets her try the camera. As she looks
through, Ross reaches in front of the camera, trying to touch
whatever is obviously zoomed in close in her view.

LINCOLN
You were scolding .. .?

ROSS
(still looking)
Huh? Right. People toys.
LINCOLN
You don’t have to impress my
brother. He likes you.

Ross looks up from the camera.

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
24.

ROSS
That has nothing to do with -- did
he say something? What did he say?

LINCOLN
He doesn’t have to say anything to
me. I know.
(beat)
I also know he wouldn’t mind if you
were in the movie.

ROSS
Really? I don’t know. That would be
kinda -- okay! -- No, I couldn’t.
He'd be mad. . . wouldn’t he?
LINCOLN
Yeah, probably.

(beat)
But what if you weren’t actually in
the movie?

Ross pretends to get it, nodding.

ROSS
Aaahhhhhh --
(gives up)
What do you mean?

CUT TO:

EXT. REPTILE HOUSE - NIGHT

A compelling aerial shot moves down and tracks left around a
corner of the building as a scared-looking LEOPARD runs by at
top speed. Some moments later, as the dust settles, an
exhausted OSTRICH runs by in pursuit.

CUT TO:
Lincoln sitting high on the neck of Ben, the giraffe. The
camera is fastened to Ben’s head and his neck is bent low and
turned, having provided the shot we just saw.

LINCOLN
Cut! That was great!

The giraffe slowly straightens his neck, lifting Lincoln
above the crowd. He looks down to the ostrich.

LINCOLN

How did that feel? Was that
alright?

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
OSTRICH
(winded)
I just don’t think anyone will
believe that I could catch him.

Murmurs of agreement from the animals.

LINCOLN

25.

They only have to believe that you

want to catch him.

Inspired, admiring approvals resonate. Lincoln is revered.

LINCOLN
Alright everyone. That’s it for
tonight. Remember, eight-o’clock

tomorrow night. We’1ll be... where

are we tomorrow?
He turns to Ross, who wears a cap and holds

ROSS
Gift shop.

LINCOLN

a clipboard.

Gift shop. Eight o’clock. Get some

rest, everyone. Great job tonight.

The giraffe puts Lincoln down next to Ross.

ROSS

You sure you wanna rip?
LINCOLN

Huh?
ROSS

Stop filming for the night.

LINCOLN

Oh, wrap. It’s wrap. Yeah, I gota

«+. thing I gotta do.

ROSS

Oh, your ... nightly ... thing.
LINCOLN

Yeah, the thing. I'll see ya

tomorrow.

Lincoln starts off.

@Michaal

Maltin / wea #1109055
26.

ROSS
Alright then, have fun -- I mean,
if it’s a fun thing.

Lincoln waves without turning around.

EXT. ZOO PATHWAY - SEVERAL MINUTES LATER

Lincoln is walking with his camera, elated. He passes a
quiet, dark cage and stops. He thinks a moment and goes back.

INT. GORILLA CAGE AREA - NIGHT

Lincoln enters. No one seems to be around, but he suddenly
hears a menacing GRUNT from a dark corner. Looking closer,
Lincoln sees the glowing eyes of WASHINGTON, a huge,
intimidating gorilla.

LINCOLN
Washington?

The gorilla GRUNTS again in the darkness.

LINCOLN
Hi. Sorry to disturb you.

WASHINGTON
Then why did you?

LINCOLN
I'm making a movie, and I need a
big tough guy. So I was wonder--

Washington suddenly ROARS and CHARGES at Lincoln, who drops
the camera in fear and jumps up a tree.

LINCOLN
Yeeez, man. What’s that all about?
We’re on the same team here.

WASHINGTON
No we’re not. Get out of here!

LINCOLN
I gotta get my camera. Can I get it
without you hurting me?

WASHINGTON
I don’t know. Can you?

Washington picks up the camera, looks at it, then suddenly
holds it up high as if he will smash it on the ground.

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
27.

LINCOLN
Don’t! It’s not mine! It’s
borrowed. C’mon. Gimme a break. You
don't want to do it, fine. A lot of
others do, though. You’ll be
ruining it for everyone.

Washington puts the camera down, growling some more, then
moves back to his dark-corner spot.

Lincoln climbs down, picks up the camera and scoots quickly
to safety. Before leaving, he calls back in:

LINCOLN
What’s with you, anyway?

Silence. Lincoln shakes his head and leaves.

EXT. ZOO PATHWAY - CONTINUOUS
Lincoln walks on and suddenly Jefferson is in his face.

JEFFERSON
Funny thing happened on the way to
the rally.

LINCOLN
Huh?

JEFFERSON
Nobody showed up. It was me in
front of a crowd of zero.

LINCOLN
There’s an easy joke there, but I’m
not going to say it.

JEFFERSON
Your little movie nonsense with
this toy of our captors is setting
back the cause.

Lincoln is angered by his brother’s selfishness.

LINCOLN
Oh, here we go again. The cause.
Freedom for all. So we can walk out
into the street and get hit by a bus.

JEFFERSON

Getting out of this prison is the
only thing that matters.

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
28.

LINCOLN
-- to you.

JEFFERSON
You're not helping.

LINCOLN
And you're just jealous because
everyone’s more interested in doing
what I want them to do.

JEFFERSON
They don’t know any better.
LINCOLN
And you do?
JEFFERSON
Yes! Movies are pointless.
LINCOLN
You've never even seen one. Movies
have a ... power. They can make you

laugh, cry, and think in all kinds
of new, exciting ways. They can ...
they can change the world.

JEFFERSON
Have you been eating bugs off the
orangutans again?

LINCOLN
That was one time.

JEFFERSON
How can you honestly think all that
make-believe nonsense could
possibly matter?

LINCOLN
They're stories. Everyone has one.

JEFFERSON
They're a waste of time.

Lincoln thinks. Eureka.

LINCOLN
Prove it.

JEFFERSON
What?

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
29.

LINCOLN
Waste some time with me. Right now.

JEFFERSON
What? Where? --
(realizes)
Is that where you -- ? Figures.

LINCOLN
Come with me. ... C’mon.

JEFFERSON
Alright, fine. But only to show you
just how stupid movies are.

LINCOLN

Just give it a fair chance.
JEFFERSON

Yeah, yeah.

They head off together, Lincoln leading the way.

INT. GUARD HOUSE AIR VENT - LATER

Lincoln’s movie-watching spot is far more cramped now that
he’s sharing it. Jefferson fidgets mercilessly.

The security office below is empty and dark, except for a
small desk lamp.

JEFFERSON
How can you sit here every night?
Where are we?

Suddenly the office door opens.

LINCOLN
Shhhhhh.
JEFFERSON
(whispers)

This is stupid already.
Lincoln puts a finger to his lips. He’s serious.

The Guard takes a DVD from its case and ceremoniously puts it
in the player.

He adeptly works the remote through menus and starts the

film. Onscreen we see an office building with a MEGAMULACORP
sign on top. A narrator speaks in voice-over:

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
30.

NARRARTOR (V.O.)
What you about to see is true. The
people involved are not actors.

Lincoln sighs in disappointment, but Jefferson is intrigued.

NARRARTOR (V.O.)
Ten years ago, nine employees of
Megamulacorp lost their life savings
while company executives got rich.

Onscreen image cuts to a group of sad-looking people.
NARRARTOR (V.O.)
These employees fought the system,
beat the odds and won their
justice. This is their story.
Lincoln shakes his head and leans to Jefferson.
LINCOLN
(whispers)
This is a documentary. They’re
boring. We can come back another ni--

JEFFERSON
Shhhhhh.

Lincoln suddenly realizes - of course - this is exactly the
kind of movie Jefferson would be into.

And into it he is. Riveted. Lincoln tries again to watch.
OLD WOMAN (V.O.)
Worked there all my life. Thought I

could trust ‘em. Guess I was wrong.

Bored already, Lincoln's eyes wander. He starts inspecting
and biting his nails.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. AIR VENTS - 90 MINUTES LATER

Jefferson in the same spot, watching. Lincoln lies next to
him, fast asleep, drool hanging from his open mouth.

As the credits roll, the guard leaves the office. Jefferson
discovers the sleeping Lincoln and shakes him.

LINCOLN

Huh? What? Who? I’m ready. -- Oh
it’s over...So, what did you think?

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
31.

Jefferson has a determined, inspired look.

JEFFERSON
Where’s that camera?

He starts away down the vent.
LINCOLN
Ha. You see? I told you. Movies can
-- wait, my camera?
Lincoln follows.
LINCOLN
Why do you want my camera?
EXT. CHIMP AREA - DAY
The chimps draw their usual crowd. Lincoln and Jefferson sit

in a hammock, concealed by tree foliage. They speak softly to
mask their conversation from the watchful humans.

LINCOLN
I don’t know. Documentaries are so
boring.

JEFFERSON

We finally have a chance to tell
our story. Really tell it.

LINCOLN
I was telling a story.
JEFFERSON
About what?
LINCOLN
An unlikely hero who saves the
world.
JEFFERSON
From ... what?
LINCOLN
(duh)
The bad guys.
JEFFERSON
Okay. And your hero is...?
LINCOLN
(proudly )
Featherman!
(MORE )

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
32.

LINCOLN (cont'd)
(reluctant)
Stuart.

JEFFERSON
The ostrich? A superhero?

LINCOLN
Featherman actually has no super
powers. He’s just highly trained --

JEFFERSON
-- Stuart?

LINCOLN
He’s the best actor I could find.
He does this thing with his
eyebrows.
(imitates)
It’s really freaky.

JEFFERSON
In a documentary, no one would have
to act. We’d all be ourselves.

LINCOLN
What about all the work we’ve done?

Jefferson fishes for an adequate answer. A-ha!

JEFFERSON
You've made everyone comfortable in
front of the camera.

LINCOLN
You mean like practice?

JEFFERSON
Rehearsal. The point is, you were
right. Movies can change the world.
So let’s change ours. Together.

LINCOLN
Together?

JEFFERSON
Our story. Our movie.

LINCOLN
I get to work the camera?

JEFFERSON
Who else could do it?
(beat)
Partners?

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
33.

Jefferson puts out his hand. Lincoln shakes it.

LINCOLN
Partners.

EXT ZOO GIFT SHOP - NIGHT

The cast and crew busily set up the shoot in and out of the
unlocked, open gift shop.

Lincoln and Jefferson arrive to see all the confused,
suspicious faces.

LINCOLN
Okay, everyone. A little change in
plans. Our movie is . . . canceled.

The group groans and looks accusingly to Jefferson, who
frantically coaches Lincoln in whispers:

JEFFERSON
Replaced. Improved. Fixed! Put a
positive spin on it!

LINCOLN
(to group)
Improved, actually. It’s a new movie.
A documentary about life in the zoo.
Jefferson's going to help. He knows a
lot about this kinda stuff.

Ross waves to Jefferson, then coaxes Lincoln into the shop.

INT. GIFT SHOP - CONTINUOUS
ROSS
We're already set up here. Are we
gonna have to move?

LINCOLN
Uh, yeah. I guess --

Jefferson has followed them in.
JEFFERSON
-- No. The gift shop is fine. Let’s
do a scene right here.

LINCOLN
Great! ... What scene?

Jefferson picks up a blue, badly made, stuffed kangaroo.

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
34.

JEFFERSON
Exploitation.

Jefferson walks out. Lincoln nods. As soon as Jefferson is
gone, Lincoln stops nodding and turns to Ross.

LINCOLN
What does that mean?

ROSS
People making money selling stuff
that looks like us.

LINCOLN
That’s bad?

ROSS
Definitely bad.

LINCOLN
Alright then. Exploration it is.

CUT TO:

INT. GIFT SHOP - LATER

A KANGAROO holds the stuffed toy and looks at the camera.
Lincoln films while Jefferson observes, off camera.

LINCOLN
Don’t you think blue kangaroos are
more fun and exciting?

KANGAROO
(confused)
No.

LINCOLN
Human people do.

A crowd of animals has gathered behind Jefferson (and the
camera). They are listening, getting steamed up, too.

KANGAROO
What do they know about kangaroos?

LINCOLN
Hard to say. They know a lot about
merchandise though. What sells and
what doesn’t. That sort of thing.

The kangaroo gets angry, still holding the doll.

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
35.

KANGAROO
Nobody asked me.

LINCOLN
Who cares what you think? You live
in a cage.

That does it. The kangaroo RIPS the head off the doll.
Stuffing POOFS out and flies in the air.

Before Jefferson can react, the crowd of animals bursts into
the shop and begins RANSACKING it.

Lincoln runs around and films all he can, while Jefferson
desperately tries to stop the chaos.

JEFFERSON
No, no. Stop! This is not the
point! We can’t do this!

Ross tries to help control the situation, while Franklin is
torn between helping Ross help Jefferson or joining in the
mayhem which looks like fun.

Finally, Jefferson finds Lincoln as he excitedly tries to
catch all he can on tape. They yell over the ruckus.

LINCOLN
This is great!

JEFFERSON
No, it’s not. It’s terrible. We’re
just proving we’re the mindless
animals they say we are.

Lincoln stops the camera and lets that sink in.

JEFFERSON
Can you get them to stop? .. .
Please?

LINCOLN

(to the crowd)
Cut!

Everyone stops in a sudden silence and looks at Lincoln.
Jefferson can’t believe his brother’s control.

LINCOLN
This is not the scene we want. To
make our point - and it’s a good
one - we have to be smart and
civilized. For now, take five.

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
36.

The animals look to each other, confused, and each begins to
take what’s left of the merchandise from the shelves.

LINCOLN
Minutes. Take five minutes. Like, a
break.

Understanding now, they all leave the shop, leaving Lincoln,
Jefferson and Ross.

LINCOLN
It’s my fault. I shouldn’t have
riled them up like that.

ROSS
It’s okay. You couldn’t have known
they’d riot.
(to Jefferson)
It’s good, though. He got through
to them. They’re mad.

JEFFERSON
We have to be more than just mad.
We have to be smart and convincing.

LINCOLN
You need a central story. Something
simple and emotional that the
audience can relate to. But it has to
be an example of the larger point.

Something triggers in Jefferson's mind. He lights up.

JEFFERSON
(to himself)
An example. . . the tigers.
(to Lincoln)
You're a genius!

LINCOLN
Thanks. What about the tigers?

JEFFERSON
They're our story. C’mon!

Jefferson runs out. Lincoln turns to Ross.

LINCOLN
Could you get everyone back in
here, and --

ROSS
-- clean up. I’m on it.

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
37.

LINCOLN
Thanks.

Lincoln leaves.

EXT. TIGER CAGE - MOMENTS LATER
Lincoln catches up with Jefferson.

LINCOLN
So what's their story?

JEFFERSON
New baby. First generation
captivity.

LINCOLN
And they're having trouble?

As if on cue, the baby crying starts from inside the cage.

JEFFERSON
Lots. . . The Dad is not going to
be cooperative.

LINCOLN
You sure?

JEFFERSON
Pretty sure.

EXT. ZOO’S TIGER AREA - CONTINUOUS

Jefferson enters. Lincoln follows close behind, already
filming. The baby tiger cries throughout.

FATHER TIGER
What are you doing back ---
(notices Lincoln)
What is he doing?

JEFFERSON
Don’t get upset. We’re making a
movie.

FATHER TIGER
A what?

JEFFERSON
It’s a documentary about our
struggles here.

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
38.

The tiger growls.

FATHER TIGER
Would you like to see struggle?

JEFFERSON
There’s no need to threaten.
LINCOLN
It’s okay. Threats are good. Very
dramatic.
JEFFERSON
Yeah but, ... I could get hurt.

The tiger LUNGES for them and they both shoot up trees.

FATHER TIGER
I can climb trees, you know.

MOTHER TIGER
But you will not.

The three guys look at her, somewhat surprised.

MOTHER TIGER
If there’s a chance this will help,
we will cooperate
(to her mate)
-- fully.
(to Jefferson)
What do we need to do?

JEFFERSON
Just let us document.

MOTHER TIGER
Document?

JEFFERSON
Film. With the camera.

LINCOLN
Pretend we’re not here.

The filming resumes, awkward at first, but soon the parents
relax, and Lincoln gets some compelling shots of the crying
baby and the tigers’ efforts to console him.

Interview shot of mother tiger.
MOTHER TIGER
Part of the problem is scheduling.
All babies need a schedule.
(MORE )

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
39.
MOTHER TIGER (cont'd)
Ours doesn’t always match the
zoo’s. And I think that confuses
him. Makes him upset. I think.

Looking up over the camera, Lincoln gives Jefferson a covert
wink. Jefferson nods.

All is well when suddenly Lincoln looks at Jefferson again -
only this time in a PANIC.

JEFFERSON
What?

Lincoln slowly hands the camera to Jefferson. Jefferson looks
through.

POV VIEWFINDER: WARNING! LOW BATTERY! flashes onscreen.
JEFFERSON
(to tigers)
Thanks. That’s all for tonight.

LINCOLN
We'll be back tomorrow.

JEFFERSON
We hope!

They quickly climb out. The tigers watch confused. Even the
baby stops crying long enough to watch the monkeys go.

EXT. TREETOPS - CONTINUOUS

Jefferson and Lincoln swinging home, in silhouette.

JEFFERSON (V.O.)
Can we fix it?

LINCOLN (V.0O.)
We need more batteries. Or to
charge this one.

JEFFERSON (V.O.)
How are we going to do that?

LINCOLN (V.0O.)
I have an idea.
EXT. ZOO CENTER - JUST BEFORE DAWN
Under background MUSIC, we see Lincoln speaking to Franklin,

BRAD and three other birds at a YOU ARE HERE directory sign.

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
40.

Lincoln occasionally points to the sign with a stick.
Although we can’t hear him, it’s obvious he is relaying a
strategic plan.

When he finishes, Franklin raises his hand and asks an
unheard question. Lincoln reacts with dismay and, by way of
answer, he slowly points to the big “You Are Here” spot.

EXT. VARIOUS ZOO AREAS — DAY

Establishing shot: the zoo is packed with loud, excited
people.

Hiding behind a tree, Franklin puts headphones in his ears
and turns on his iPod.

CUE MUSIC MONTAGE - Jimi Hendrix: Crosstown Traffic

Franklin slips and ducks around the zoo - COMPLETELY
UNNOTICED by humans -- and PICKPOCKETS them, taking video
camera batteries and accessories from bags and backpacks.

He tosses whatever he pilfers up to the birds, who catch the
items in flight and bring them to ...

EXT. CHIMP AREA - DAY

Lincoln sits hidden from view behind rocks.

A bird flies in, carrying a camera battery. He lands on a
branch above Lincoln and drops the battery. Lincoln catches
it and tests it in the camera. It fits. He gives the bird the
thumbs-up, and the bird flies away.

A few moments later another bird flies in carrying a
different sized battery. Lincoln checks it, shakes his head
and tosses it back to the bird who catches it and flies off.

EXT. LOST AND FOUND - DAY

When the attendant is not looking, Brad appears, places the
rejected battery on the counter and flies away.

The attendant turns back and is surprised to see the battery.

She takes it and puts it on a shelf -- alongside SEVERAL
OTHER video camera batteries, of all shapes and sizes.

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
41.

INT. MONKEY CAGE - MORNING

Lincoln sits behind the rocks checking a battery. It’s good.
He puts it with several others and signals to the delivery
bird by dragging his finger across his neck. They're done.

END MUSIC MONTAGE

EXT. TIGER AREA - NIGHT

Lincoln works the camera as Jefferson speaks to the Mother
Tiger, who holds the baby in a rare moment of quiet sleep.

MOTHER TIGER
It’s the only life he’1l ever know.

JEFFERSON
Captivity?

MOTHER TIGER
Yes.

The father comes into the shot. Calm. Concerned.
JEFFERSON
(to him)
And how does that make you feel?
FATHER TIGER
(thinks )
Sad, I guess.

Lincoln zooms the shot in close, then CUTS. The brothers look
to each other with pride, almost disbelief.

LINCOLN
I think we got it.

JEFFERSON
I think so, too.

They nod their thanks to the Mother Tiger and quietly leave.

INT. MONKEY CAGE - LATE NIGHT

Jefferson by himself reading “Public Speaking for Dummies”.
Ross knocks and Jefferson scrambles to hide the book.

ROSS
Hi.

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
42.

JEFFERSON
Hi, Ross. C’mon in.

ROSS
Where’s Lincoln?

JEFFERSON
Taking care of some business. He’ll
be back in a little while.

ROSS
Oh, no. I wasn’t coming to see him.
He just wasn’t here. Isn’t here.

JEFFERSON
Oh.
ROSS
So what’s new?
JEFFERSON
(toying)

Oh nothing really. Except that we
finished filming tonight.

ROSS
Oh, that’s nice--
(realizes)
You what? You’re done.
Congratulations!

She hugs him, and they awkwardly de-tangle themselves.
Jefferson clears his throat.

ROSS
That’s really great. I’m so proud --
we're all so proud.

JEFFERSON
Well, we couldn’t have done it
without everyone’s help. Especially

yours.
ROSS
Oh, I didn’t do much.
JEFFERSON
Sure you did.
ROSS
Thanks.
JEFFERSON

You’re welcome.

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
43.

They share yet another long, awkward moment.

ROSS

So where is Lincoln?
JEFFERSON

Taking care of some business.
ROSS

Ah.
JEFFERSON

Yeah.

INT. ZOO OFFICE - NIGHT

Lincoln sits alone at a worker's cluttered desk, clicking the
mouse of a computer. The screen shows a website: FLYTIX.COM,
with airplane and ticket logo. He reads and types.

LINCOLN
Destination? Hollywood. Passengers?
Two. Credit Card... ?

On the wall is a post-it note with a list of work-related
numbers. He drags his finger down the list until he finds:

LINCOLN
Travel account.

He smiles as he types in the numbers.

EXT. ZOO SQUARE - NIGHT

The square is packed with animals. Behind the “stage” area, a
huge sheet has been hung taut to act as a screen.

Franklin hooks the DV camera (red, yellow, white) to the
zoo's AV equipment. He seems to know what’s he’s doing.

From the side of the stage, Lincoln, Jefferson and Ross watch
as the place fills to capacity. Jefferson is visibly nervous.

JEFFERSON
(to himself)
...Just some opening remarks.

LINCOLN
You don’t have to do this.

JEFFERSON
I can do this.

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
44,

From the other side of the stage, Franklin turns off the
overhead lights, leaving one like a spotlight shining on the
stage. The crowd murmur dies down to a still silence.

JEFFERSON
Maybe you better do this.

LINCOLN
I’m on it.

Lincoln bounds on stage like a rock star to enthusiastic
applause. We waves, milking the attention.

LINCOLN
I'd like to thank you all for
coming to tonight’s premiere of “In
the Cage”. This is your movie. Your
story. Your hard work, sacrifice
and honesty are what brought us
here. Wait, there was one other
thing. One very important someone
whose strength and vision made this
movie a reality. He’s a very
special animal...

He looks to Jefferson.
LINCOLN
.+. And I’m not just saying that
because he’s my brother. Let’s give
a big hand to the genius behind
this movie ... Jefferson!
Lincoln leads the clapping and the crowd joins in.

Jefferson waves and nods sheepishly from the sidelines while
Ross proudly goes wild next to him.

When the applause subside, some JOKER animal in the back
calls out:

JOKER ANIMAL (0.S.)
Speech!

LINCOLN
Alright, that’s not funny.

The crowd suppresses a laugh. Jefferson takes it in stride.

LINCOLN
Let's watch the movie, shall we?

The light on Lincoln fades and sheet/screen suddenly glows
with projected light.

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
45.

The movie begins with a series of close-ups of cage bars and
locks. Jefferson's voice comes in under the picture, a
smooth, confident V.O. narrator.

JEFFERSON (V.O.)
It looks harmless enough from the
outside, but don’t be fooled. Life
in a zoo is no different than life
in prison. Except for one thing.
Those in prison, it can be assumed,
have committed some crime.

The animal audience watches, intrigued. The shot switches to
Stuart, the ostrich, looking helpless and hopeless.

OSTRICH
I never did anything wrong.

Shots of other animals, looking sad, in their cages.

JEFFERSON
So why is it that we are forced to
live in these cages, unable to roam
free as we are meant to.
(dramatic pause)
Unable to form the family bonds
that are supposed to be so natural.

The film cuts to the tiger footage. The audience remains
engrossed as they feel for the crying baby tiger.

IN THE WINGS:

Lincoln motions for Jefferson to follow him. While the crowd
continues to watch, the two brothers quietly duck away.

INT. ZOO BATHROOM - MINUTES LATER

Jefferson at the sink. He’s just finished splashing his face
and looks up into the mirror.

He’s STARTLED to see Lincoln standing behind him, menacingly
holding up a STRAIGHT RAZOR that flashes in the light.

JEFFERSON
Ahhh!!! Holy smokes! What are you-?

Lincoln laughs. Jefferson regains his breath.
LINCOLN
Sorry, I’ve always wanted to do

that. Here you go, little brother.
Time to humanize.

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
46.
He hands Jefferson the razor and squirts shaving cream into
his own hand.

JEFFERSON
You’re sure about this?

LINCOLN
Of course.

He puts shaving cream all over his neck, chin and cheeks, and
with another razor, expertly removes a section of hair .

In a MUSIC MONTAGE, Lincoln and Jefferson shave their whole
bodies then get dressed in mini-outfits: jeans, trendy
striped shirts, sportcoats and hip shoes.

They admire themselves in the full-length mirror.

Lincoln is completely bald, but Jefferson opted for leaving
black hair on top of his head in a mod style.

JEFFERSON
Where'd you get all this stuff?

LINCOLN
I know people.

JEFFERSON
(thinks )
No you don’t.
Lincoln shrugs and checks his watch.

LINCOLN
We better get back.

They head out the door.
JEFFERSON (0.S.)
How come you get a watch?
EXT. ZOO SQUARE - 90 MINUTES LATER

The animal audience still watching the screen. Their sadness
has changed to determination. They’re inspired.

JEFFERSON (V.O.)
Our day of freedom will come. It is
what’s right. It is our destiny.

Finale music swells, and the crowd bursts into cheers.

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
47.
Lincoln and Jefferson arrive back in the wings just in time.
They couldn’t be prouder.

LINCOLN
You did it.

JEFFERSON
We did it.

They shake hands, then yank each other into a brotherly hug.
The animals swarm over to Lincoln and Jefferson, ready to
congratulate them, but the whole crowd STOPS DEAD, STUNNED
SILENT when they see the shaved, dressed chimps.

Ross, in front, GULPS.

ROSS
I see you guys had a makeover thing
while we, um... a little extreme
perhaps, but nice. It could work.

(beat)
I like the shoes.

LINCOLN

(to everyone)
I can explain. We’re glad you liked
the movie, and I’m proud to
announce that Jefferson and I are
leaving - tonight - to take “In the
Cage” to the Moonsong Film Festival
in Hollywood.

CROWD
Ooooohhhhh....

LINCOLN
If we win, uh ... I mean when we
win, everyone will see our movie.

 

CROWD
Hooray!

Relieved, the animals resume their congratulations with back
slapping and handshakes.

Franklin approaches the brothers with a Polaroid camera.

FRANKLIN
You two.

Lincoln and Jefferson turn together in a smiling pose.

Franklin SNAPS the picture. As it comes out the front he
hands it to Lincoln.

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
48.

ROSS (0.S.)
Folks! Excuse me. If everyone will
come this way . . . We can continue

this party in style.
She leads them to a nearby clearing where a “premiere party”
has been set up with snack carts and soda machines. On the
center table is an ice sculpture of a person in a bathtub.
The animals pick up the pace, pass Ross and dig in.

CUT TO:

INSERT THEATER: Alone, Lincoln puts the movie tape with the
camera in a leather bag, which he carries on his shoulder.

He looks at the developing Polaroid of him and Jefferson.
After it comes into view, he puts it in the camera bag.
EXT. ZOO GROUNDS - CONTINUOUS

Jefferson and Ross at the party.

ROSS
It really is great.
JEFFERSON
Thanks.
ROSS

So you're leaving?

JEFFERSON
Flight’s first thing in the
morning. We gotta be outta here.

ROSS
Oh.

JEFFERSON
It’s like three days. We’ll be back
before you miss us.

ROSS
I miss you already.

Jefferson is surprised. Ross realizes she said that out loud.

ROSS
I mean - I just meant... Good luck.

JEFFERSON
Thanks.

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
ROSS
I’m just gonna go, you know, whoop
it up.

49.

She makes the “raise the roof” gesture. Jefferson laughs.

ROSS
What?
JEFFERSON
You're not the whooping type.
ROSS
What are you saying?
JEFFERSON
That you don’t whoop.
ROSS
I whoop. I can whoop with the best
of ‘em.
JEFFERSON
Uh-huh, sure.
ROSS
Ask Franklin.
JEFFERSON
Oh, there’s a reliable source.
ROSS JEFFERSON
I’m crushed that -- -- Come with us.
ROSS

What? Where?

JEFFERSON
To this movie festival thing.

ROSS
I couldn’t - could I?

JEFFERSON
Why not?

EXT. ZOO PARTY - MINUTES LATER

Lincoln and Jefferson, off by themselves.

CUT TO:

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
50.

LINCOLN
-- Because I only have two plane
tickets, that’s why not! Me and you.
(calms )
Look, little brother, I’m glad you
asked her. That’s a big step.

Lincoln looks over Jefferson's shoulder at something.

JEFFERSON
It’s okay. She’1ll understand. She’s
very ... what’s the word I’m
looking for?

LINCOLN
Packed.

Suddenly Ross runs up to them, carrying several packed bags.

ROSS
Hi guys! This is so exciting!

JEFFERSON
Yeah ... Ross ... The thing is.

ROSS
What? What is the thing? I can’t
go. You're saying I can’t go.
That's the thing.

JEFFERSON
There are only two tickets. One for
Lincoln --

Lincoln holds up the tickets. Suddenly a big gorilla hand
comes into frame and takes one. Lincoln reacts.

WASHINGTON (0.S.)
-- and one for me.

LINCOLN
Hey! Give that back!

Washington inspects the ticket.

WASHINGTON
I'll be joining you on your trip.

LINCOLN
I don’t think so.

WASHINGTON
I wasn’t asking.

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
51.

LINCOLN
Yeah, well as much as I'd enjoy
your delightful company, this is
our trip. So go back to your cave,
Kong.

Lincoln tries to snatch the ticket back from Washington, but
can’t get clear before Washington grabs him by the throat.

JEFFERSON
Whoa-whoa! Wait a sec! Let go of
him! What’s going on here?

LINCOLN
(choked)
I think he wants a ticket.

JEFFERSON
Put him down!

Washington drops Lincoln, who lands breathing heavily.
JEFFERSON

(to Washington)
What’s this about?

WASHINGTON
(seething)
I would like... very much... to

accompany you to Hollywood.

JEFFERSON
Well, you can’t. Sorry.

WASHINGTON
One ticket for me. One for him.

Washington points to Lincoln.

JEFFERSON
What about me?

WASHINGTON
You go in here.

He reveals a giant duffle bag.

WASHINGTON (CONT’D)
Avoid the big ...city ... crowds.

Jefferson suddenly looks nervous. Lincoln has regained his
breath and pulls Jefferson aside.

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
52.

LINCOLN
Don’t listen to him. He’s just
trying to scare you.

JEFFERSON
(scared)
Maybe he could, you know, protect us.

LINCOLN
And who'd protect us from him?

 

WASHINGTON
We'd better get going. We don’t
want to miss our flight.

LINCOLN
No way. This trip is about the
movie. The movie you didn’t want to
be a part of.

JEFFERSON
He’s right, Washington. I’m sorry.

WASHINGTON
(re duffle bag)
There’s room for your friend. And
all her luggage.

Jefferson pauses. He looks at Ross, who tries to hide the
fact that she’s suddenly beaming with hope.

LINCOLN
Alright, fine. You win. Hey,
everyone! What does an 800-pound
gorilla get? Anything he wants.
Ha-ha.
(to Jefferson and Ross)
Get in the bag and let’s go.

CUT TO:

ROSS AND FRANKLIN

Ross holds Franklin by the shoulders. He has his headphones
in, so Ross talks loudly.

ROSS
Now I’ll only be gone a few days.
You'll be alright, alright?

Franklin nods.

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
53.

ROSS
Just stay out of trouble. Practice
your skateboarding. I want to see
new tricks when I come back, okay?
Franklin nods again.

CUT TO:

ZOO CLEARING - MOMENTS LATER

The animals wish the group well. Jefferson helps Ross put her
luggage into the duffle. Then they climb in. The bag looks
ridiculously heavy, but Washington picks it up with ease.

He follows Lincoln, who has walked ahead, fuming.

EXT. ZOO FRONT GATE - A MINUTE LATER
Lincoln and Washington arrive. As Lincoln fishes in his jeans
pocket, Washington reaches for the lock as if he will rip it
off to free them. Lincoln stops him.

LINCOLN
Whoa, whoa, Mighty Joe.

Lincoln produces a key from his pocket.
LINCOLN
No destruction. See this as the
first of many things on this trip
we're going to do my way. Got it?
Lincoln unlocks the gate and swings it open.

WASHINGTON
Of course.

LINCOLN
Why are you coming anyway? What's
in it for you?

WASHINGTON
It’s personal.

LINCOLN
Great - thanks for sharing.

WASHINGTON
You’re welcome.

They walk out.

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
54.

EXT. STREET - MINUTES LATER

At a corner, Lincoln stands alone next to the duffle. He
hails a cab. When the cab stops, Lincoln calls in.

LINCOLN
Pop the trunk?

The trunk pops open and Lincoln reaches for the enormous bag.
But in one fluid motion, Washington appears from behind a
tree, grabs the bag, puts it in the trunk, climbs into the
trunk himself and closes the hood.

Lincoln makes as if he did all that and gets in the backseat.

LINCOLN (0.S.)
Airport.

The cab pulls away.

EXT. AIRPORT - 20 MINUTES LATER
The cab idles far from the curbside check-in crowd. Lincoln
and Washington (with the duffle) duck inside the terminal.
INT. AIRPORT-— CONTINUOUS
Lincoln and Washington look around.
LINCOLN

We gotta find you some clothes. But

first, gimme your ticket. I’1l do

all the talking.

WASHINGTON
You have my ticket.

LINCOLN
No I don’t. You took it. I still
have the scar.

Lincoln points to his neck.

WASHINGTON
You took it back.

LINCOLN

(panicked)
No I didn’t!

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
55.

WASHINGTON
Then Jefferson did.

Lincoln is already unzipping the duffle.

LINCOLN
Do you have the other ticket!?

JEFFERSON
(from within)
Nope.

Lincoln glares at Washington.

WASHINGTON
Somebody took it.

LINCOLN
Yes! You! You took it! From me! And
that, not so coincidentally, is when
everything started going wrong!

Jefferson pokes his head out.

JEFFERSON
Calm down. It has to be around here
somewhere.

LINCOLN
No, actually, it doesn’t! The truth
is, it could be anywhere. Anywhere!

CUT TO:

EXT ZOO SQUARE —- SIMULTANEOUS

Bouncing to his music, Franklin sweeps up after the party. He
unknowingly pushes the missing ticket onto a trash heap.

JEFFERSON (V.O.)
You're exaggerating.

INT. AIRPORT - SIMULTANEOUS
Back to the gang.

LINCOLN
(fake calm)
You're right. There are a lot of
places where that ticket cannot be.
Unfortunately, one of those places
seems to be here with us!

 

 

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
56.

Ross pokes her head out of the bag.

ROSS
Ahem! Guys. I think the idea is to
keep a low profile.

JEFFERSON
She's right. Let’s just think of a
plan. We can fix this.

WASHINGTON
(to Lincoln)
I take the ticket, and you get in
the bag.

LINCOLN
No way! You’ve messed up enough
already. I’m not having you talking
to people and getting us sent...
who-knows-where. If anyone’s
getting in that bag, it’s you!

Lincoln suddenly falls into thought, glancing back and forth
between the bag and Washington. Jefferson catches on.

JEFFERSON
That's imposs--

LINCOLN
-- Nothing’s impossible.

CUT TO:

INT. AIRPORT - MINUTES LATER

Now carrying the VIDEO CAMERA BAG over his shoulder, Lincoln
stands by himself next to the duffle bag, which is even more
stuffed. It looks as though the seams will burst.

Lincoln begins walking away, then turns back and snaps his
fingers at the bag.

The bag STANDS UP, thanks to Washington’s HANDS AND FEET
sticking out holes cut into the bottom. He walks behind
Lincoln, revealing all Ross’ luggage which has been left
behind to make room.

CUT TO:

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
57.

INT. AIRPORT TICKET COUNTER - MINUTES LATER

Lincoln checks the bag. The COUNTER REP looks at the scale
and shows surprise. The scale shows FIFTY POUNDS.

COUNTER REP
Only fifty pounds. Looks much
heavier than that.

LINCOLN
I don’t like hotel pillows.

COUNTER REP
So you bring your own? What a great
idea!

PULL BACK WIDE TO REVEAL

The duffle bag is on the scale, but Washington's foot is
sticking out onto the floor, taking all the weight.

While the counter rep types, Washington switches feet so he

can maneuver onto the conveyor belt behind the counter rep.

The scale momentarily shows full weight: 950 pounds.

The counter rep stops typing and does a double-take, but the
scale number suddenly returns to 50. Washington’s other foot
has reached the floor behind her.

The rep shakes it off and easily hoists the bag -- with
Washington’s help - onto the conveyor.

Lincoln watches anxiously as the oversized bag moves away.

COUNTER REP
Sir? .. . Sir?

Lincoln snaps from his trance. She hands him his boarding
pass.

COUNTER REP
Your boarding pass. Gate Seven B.
Have a good trip. Sleep well!

She smiles at her cleverness, so Lincoln does too. He looks
down the conveyor belt again, but the bag is gone.

CUT TO:
AIRPORT SECURITY GATE - MINUTES LATER
Lincoln approaches the gate, the camera bag on his shoulder.

He watches those before him to see what this is all about.

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
58.

When it’s his turn, he puts the camera bag on the moving belt
and watches nervously as it goes into the machine. The GUARD
holds a plastic bowl out to Lincoln.

GUARD
Keys? Loose change? Cell phone?

Lincoln just shrugs and shakes his head, so the guard motions
him through.

Lincoln passes through the gate without any alarm. On the
other side, he gets his camera bag, then stops to notice a
TODDLER being scanned with an electronic wand. Lincoln walks
on and we see, waiting for their turn behind the TODDLER, are
an ELDERLY MAN, a NUN and a fully decorated MILITARY OFFICER.

INT. AIRPLANE - 20 MINUTES LATER

Lincoln finds his window seat and settles in, glad that
everything is back on plan. He looks out the window and is
surprised to see Ross’ luggage by itself out on the runway.

LINCOLN
(to himself)
Hey, isn’t that --?

BOOM! The luggage suddenly EXPLODES and security forces rush
in to inspect. Lincoln winces.

Then he sees a runway worker loading luggage onto his plane.

When he grabs the giant duffle, Washington’s feet come out
the bottom and he “walks” to the conveyor belt.

Lincoln smiles.

STACY (0.S.)
Magazine, sir?

Lincoln looks up to see STACY, a blond mannequin of a flight
attendant, holding magazines.

STACY (CONT'D)
We have Global News Today, Science
Today, Gourmet Today, Investing
Today, Fashion Today and Movie Talk.

Lincoln perks up, takes Movie Talk and flips through it.

LINCOLN (V.O.)
(in his head)
Look at all this glitz and glamour.
Hollywood is definitely the life.
(MORE )

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
59.

LINCOLN (V.O.) (cont'd)
And I’m almost there. Whoa, she’s
with him? What’s up with that?

He comes across a feature on the Moonsong Film Festival.

LINCOLN (V.0O.)
Huh. Moonsong. It’s a sign. Let’s
see what it says...

(reading to himself)

Once a year, Hollywood's elite
gathers in the mountainside town of
Rockbluff, Colorado for a three-day
event showcasing the year’s best
independent movies.

Lincoln sighs, closes his eyes dreamily and lays his head
back. After a moment or two of bliss...

His eyes POP OPEN in PANIC. He looks back down at the
magazine, then stands up on his seat.

LINCOLN
Rockbluff, Colorado?!

Stacy, the flight attendant swoops over to him.

STACY
Sir, I'll have to ask you to take
your seat and remain calm.

LINCOLN
I’m on the wrong plane! I thought I
was going to Hollywood.

STACY
It’s okay. There’s no airport in
Hollywood. This is a Los Angeles
flight. You can --

LINCOLN
-- No - I’m supposed to go to
Rockbluff, Colorado! I gotta get
off! Don’t shut that door!

Passengers are freaking out at the strange dwarf causing a
scene. TRACY, another plastic-perfect attendant comes by.

TRACY
What’s the trouble?

STACY
Says he’s on the wrong plane.

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
60.

LINCOLN
Knows he’s on the wrong plane.
STACY
Needs to go to Rockbluff, Colorado.
TRACY
(perks up)
For the Moonsong Film Festival?
LINCOLN
(sighs relief)
Yes . . . Thank you. If you could

just open the door.

TRACY
Are you, like, famous?

Lincoln sees his opportunity and plays along.
LINCOLN
Well, I guess you might say that.
Name’s Lincoln. I’m a director.
Stacy and Tracy GASP, and start jockeying for position,
straightening their hair, and blinking a lot. Lincoln plays
into them.
LINCOLN
Haven’t I seen you two in something?
That movie about the genius super-
models who save the world? That was
you, wasn’t it?
They giggle modestly.

STACY TRACY
No. No.

LINCOLN
It wasn’t?! Well, it shoulda been!
Look, I just need a small favor.

CUT TO:

INT. AIRPLANE DOOR - A MINUTE LATER
Stacy and Tracy escort Lincoln back out of the plane.

STACY
Your ticket’s at your new gate.

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
61.
LINCOLN
Thanks. I just need my bag.
STACY
Already brought up. It’s back

inside there.

LINCOLN
Thanks, Tracy.

STACY
I'm Stacy!

TRACY
I'm Tracy!

LINCOLN
And don’t ever change.

Their giggling is silenced only by the plane door closing.

INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL GATE - A MINUTE LATER
No one is around. Lincoln comes back in from the plane and
looks around. The only bag is a large plaid suitcase with a
NOTE on it.
Lincoln rushes to it and reads the note.
INSERT NOTE: Passenger Lincoln.
LINCOLN

Uh, no... wrong bag. Hello? Not

mine. Anyone?
He looks to the window just in time to see his plane take
off. As it climbs, he walks toward the window in a daze. He
keeps walking until -

THUD. His forehead hits the glass. It doesn’t seem to phase
him. He just watches the plane disappear.

CUT TO:

INT. AIRPLANE - A HALF-HOUR LATER
En route to Denver, Lincoln sits between a fast-asleep rocker

teen and an overweight businessman juggling files, coffee and
a laptop in the cramped space.

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
62.

Lincoln looks worried. Although racked with guilt, he can’t
help but steal glances at the romantic comedy playing
silently on the plane’s small movie screen.

ETHAN (0.S.)
Could this be any more ridiculous?

Lincoln PERKS UP at the familiar voice, coming from the aisle
seat in the row in front of him.

So he slowly unbuckles his belt and stands on his seat,
cautiously leaning forward. Peeking.

Sure enough, it’s Ethan Latte, blabbing to the cute female
traveler next to him. She wears headphones, trying to enjoy
the movie. Ethan watches without headphones, commenting

loudly. She does her best to ignore him without being rude.

ETHAN
And we're supposed to believe that?
(leaning to her)
Why buy headphones, baby? Same movie
we've all seen a thousand times.

She gives up, takes off the headphones and immediately takes
out a book to focus on.

ETHAN

I’m with you, baby. That romantic
comedy nonsense just stinks.

(beat)
I have a film in the Moonsong Film
Festival. I’m headed there now to
pick up my prize.

(smirks)
Of course, there’1l be other films
there, too. But let’s just say I
like my chances.

She says nothing. Lincoln listens through the long pause
which doesn’t seem to bother Ethan.

ETHAN
My film’s called “Zoe’s Time”. It’s
about a young girl struggling to
find herself. Moonsong recognized
the genius of it. Thousands of
films are submitted, you know, but
only the best of the best are
selected. It’s not like you can
just show up with a videotape.

Lincoln GULPS at this new, disturbing bit of information. He
slumps back in his chair, lost in thought - and guilt.

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
63.

He takes up the camera bag, takes out the final-cut DV tape
marked “In the Cage” and stares at it.

ETHAN (0.S.)

No way, baby. Not at Moonsong. This
is the big time. Amateurs and
losers, stay home.

Next to the camera is the Polaroid of him and Jefferson. He
takes it out and looks at it, troubled. Lincoln settles back
in his seat, lost in thought.

LINCOLN (V.O.)

Okay, status update. I’m on my way
to a festival I wasn’t invited to.
With a movie I won’t be able to show
anyone. And my brother will soon
arrive lost in another city. Okay.
Could this trip get any worse?

ETHAN (0.S.)
You know who’s overrated? The
German Expressionists -- I know

what you’re going to say, the
emphasis on self through the medium
- believe me, I’m all for that. But
what did they really accomplish,
artistically?

The sleeping teen next to Lincoln fidgets, and his headphones
fall off onto his lap. Lincoln carefully unplugs them from
the teen’s music player, plugs them into his armrest, and
puts them on, settling in to the movie.

INT. L.A. AIRPORT BAGGAGE CLAIM - HOURS LATER
The giant duffle sits alone beside the baggage carousel under
an “oversized bags” sign. The zipper is pulled from the

inside and gives, sliding open a little. Jefferson peeks out.

WASHINGTON (0.S.)
Where is he?

JEFFERSON
He’ll be here. Just shhhh!

WASHINGTON (0.S.)
I have a cramp.

JEFFERSON
Who doesn’t?

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
64.

ROSS (0.S.)
I do! I’m sorry - was that one of
those historical questions?

JEFFERSON
Alright the coast is clear. I’1l
have a look around.

Jefferson tries to get out smoothly and cautiously, but trips
when his foot gets stuck. He tries to kick free.

ROSS (0.S.)
Ow. That would be me.

JEFFERSON
Sorry.

After more clumsy struggle, he frees himself, just as a
buzzing ALARM SOUNDS.

Jefferson freezes, thinking he’s caught, but it’s just a
carousel starting up. The room suddenly fills with passengers
from another flight.

Jefferson freezes again at the sight of the human crowd.
Washington notices.

WASHINGTON
Never mind them. Just find Lincoln.

JEFFERSON
(gulp)
Maybe you better come along.

Jefferson grabs the duffel handle. Washington sighs and
sticks his hands and feet out the bottom to walk along.

Jefferson walks along the rental car counters “carrying” huge
duffel, and getting perplexed stares from people he passes.

They arrive at the quarter-locker area.
JEFFERSON
Maybe we can find you some clothes
and you can get out.

The bag unzips. Washington gets out. Ross sticks her head out.

WASHINGTON
I’m all for that.

Jefferson motions with his head toward the lockers.

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
65.

WASHINGTON
You want me to break the doors?

JEFFERSON
Do I look like I have a key?

Washington smiles as he RIPS the door open. Inside is a
suitcase containing a few items, including a huge, tent-like
DRESS and matching floppy HAT.

JEFFERSON
Perfect.
WASHINGTON
I don’t think so.
JEFFERSON
We're not shopping here. It fits;

put it on.

Washington GRUNTS and pulls the dress over his head and puts
on the hat. Jefferson motions for him to pick up the bag, but
Washington just stands there.

JEFFERSON
C'mon.

WASHINGTON
I - can’t.

JEFFERSON

Look, I don’t care if you’re
embarrassed. Now swallow your pride
and let’s go.

WASHINGTON
I... can’t.

JEFFERSON
Why not?!

WASHINGTON

I need you to zip me up.

Jefferson suppresses a laugh and stands on the duffle to zip
Washington’s dress. He comes down and inspects the outfit.

JEFFERSON
It’s so last year. Are you okay
with that?

Ross laughs.

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
66.

WASHINGTON
You know what I think is funny? All
this joking around after being
abandoned.

JEFFERSON
What? Lincoln did not abandon us.

WASHINGTON
You have a better explanation?

JEFFERSON
He’s obviously in trouble. Do you
know what they do to anyone doing
anything out of the ordinary on
airplanes and airports these days?!

ROSS
It’s a total violation of civil
rights.

JEFFERSON

He could be captured. Those people
could be, at this very moment,
torturing him with tiny, sharp
objects!

CUT TO:

INT. MOONSONG FILM FESTIVAL RECEPTION - EVENING

CLOSE ON: a human hand holding a toothpick. The hands THRUSTS
down and we follow as the toothpick lands ...

.» . . in a Swedish meatball on a houer d’ovre tray full of
meatballs. The human picks up the meatball and eats it.

As the waiter moves along, we see Lincoln outside a window,
peeking in at the party.

EXT. MOONSONG RECEPTION - CONTINUOUS

Lincoln at the window. He peeks around the building’s corner
at the entrance. Everyone going into the party wears a
festival credential badge A security guard checks badges and
greets guests warmly.

Without a badge, Lincoln is stumped -- until he sees Ethan
Latte coming OUT of the party dialing his cell phone. Ethan
walks a comfortable distance from the building.

Lincoln climbs up a tree and over above Ethan, listening.

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
67.

ETHAN
(into phone)
It’s a lock. Nothing but hacks
here. That prize is as good as
mine. Call me when you get this
message. Ciao!

Behind him, Lincoln jumps down - right in Ethan’s path - just
before Ethan turns back.

Ethan is startled by this short, odd-looking man.

LINCOLN
Ethan Latte?

ETHAN
Yes, and you are?

LINCOLN
Max Linkletter. Bigshot
Productions. Got a sneak peek of
your film. Don’t ask how. The thing
is, you made it. I love it. We want
it. And we'll pay big.

ETHAN
I’m sure there will be many offers.

LINCOLN
Not like ours, kid. Six picture
deal. Nobody gets in your way.
Ever. Walk with me. We'll talk
Lincoln heads away from the front door, around the building.

ETHAN
Why not just talk inside?

LINCOLN
Too many Hollywood phonies, know
what I’m saying?

ETHAN
I sure do.

Ethan follows him.

EXT. MOONSONG RECEPTION - MINUTES LATER
Lincoln has led Ethan to a side service/kitchen delivery

entrance. Large crates and boxes are stacked around. A
delivery truck with its back open idles nearby.

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
68.

No one is around.

ETHAN
So you have a deal for me?

LINCOLN
All in good time. But first --

Lincoln jumps onto a stack of crates, making him about as
tall as Ethan. He puts his arm around Ethan’s shoulder.

LINCOLN
-- I want you to picture something
with me. . . Your name, in lights -

Lincoln directs Ethan’s gaze into the night sky. While
Lincoln speaks and Ethan dreams, Lincoln uses his tail to
swipe Ethan’s Festival Credentials, cell phone and hotel key.

LINCOLN
- as tall as a building! Everyone
knowing what they’re coming to see.
The name of the movie -- er, I mean
the film, doesn’t even matter. As
long as it was made by Ethan Latte.

 

ETHAN
I like the way you think.

Suddenly Ethan’s cell phone - in LINCOLN’S pocket - rings.
Ethan is perplexed, can’t find his phone, then notices his
badge and room key are gone, too.

LINCOLN
Hey! What’s going on here? who are
you?!?

Lincoln climbs up higher, out of reach.

LINCOLN
I told you. Rex Litelinker.

ETHAN
You said your name was Max Linkletter.

LINCOLN
(busted)
Well, you can never have too many
names in Hollywood.

Ethan climbs after him, but Lincoln easily gets down. Lincoln
runs along the delivery dock and Ethan chases, fuming, when
suddenly the service entrance door swings open and SMACKS him
dead in the face.

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
69.

An oblivious DELIVERY GUY walks past to his truck. The door
swings closed, revealing a dizzy Ethan, who angrily stumbles
on toward a seemingly cornered Lincoln.

Ethan lunges to TACKLE Lincoln, but the chimp deftly climbs
the crates, leaving Ethan to CRASH into them.

Now even more groggy, Ethan looks around for Lincoln.

ETHAN
Where are you, you little freak?

LINCOLN (0.S.)
Over here, you pretentious amateur.

Ethan spies Lincoln standing on the edge of the loading dock,
with truck right behind him.

Enraged at the insult, a bruised and battered Ethan races for
him. At the last second Lincoln unlatches the truck’s back
door, and holds the strap. As the door rolls up and open,
Lincoln is lifted out of harm's way.

Lincoln’s tail, hanging down, holds a BOARD which SMACKS the
rushing Ethan right in the face.

Lincoln jumps back to the dock. Practically unconscious,
Ethan stands teetering on the edge of the small loading dock.

As the delivery truck revs into gear, Lincoln swings his tail
around so the board BONKS Ethan on the butt, knocking him
into the back of the truck. The impact of Ethan landing and
the truck pulling away causes the door to tumble down shut.

Lincoln tosses the board, which LOCKS the truck door, just as
the truck pulls away.

Satisfied, Lincoln nods and turns away.

EXT. MOONSONG RECEPTION FRONT DOOR - MOMENTS LATER

Lincoln enters showing Ethan’s credentials. He’s fixed his
own picture and name to the badge.

INT. MOONSONG RECEPTION - SIMULTANEOUS

Lincoln soaks up the scene, but only gets odd stares from the
beautiful, wealthy Hollywood crowd. He takes out Ethan's cell

phone and PRETENDS to talk on it - just loud enough so those
around him can hear.

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
70.

LINCOLN
I’m telling you, they got my film
title wrong. I spent all this time
and money making “Zooing Time” and
it shows up in the program as
“Zoey's Time.”

A RECEPTION MAN and WOMAN nearby lean in, listening.

LINCOLN
I couldn't believe it.... I’m not
kidding. Some festival this turned
out to be. I kept telling them:
“It’s not Zoey’s Time. It’s “Zooing
Time...”

He looks around to ensure he’s being listened to.

LINCOLN
--. It’s not “Zoey’s Time”. It’s
Zooing Time.” I don’t know how much
clearer I can be.

RECEPTION MAN
(whispers)
Zooing Time?
The woman raises her eyebrows in interest then whispers in
the ear of another woman nearby. That woman takes out her
program and together they look and point.
LINCOLN
As far as I’m concerned this
festival's reputation is at stake.

MONTAGE of guests whispering and pointing as the news spreads
throughout the party.

Lincoln looks around triumphantly.

INT. LOS ANGELES AIRPORT COFFEE SHOP - DAY
Jefferson and Washington (in his dress and hat, carrying a
large purse) stand with coffees at the cream and sugar
counter.
Ross pokes her head out of Washington's purse.
ROSS
That smells good. Did you get me

one?

By way of answer, Washington pushes her head back in.

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
71.

They watch another patron, COFFEE GUY approach, dump coffee
into the trash and pour cream in. Shrugging to each other,

Jefferson and Washington do the same.

JEFFERSON
Excuse me, we’re trying to get to
the Moonsong Film Festival.

COFFEE GUY
First thing is get back on a plane.

JEFFERSON
Pardon?

COFFEE GUY
Festival’s in Colorado.
(thinks )
Or you could take a bus. A lot
cheaper. Good luck!

The Coffee Guy walks away, sipping carefully.

EXT. AIRPORT SIDEWALK - MINUTES LATER

Jefferson and Washington come out into the bustle of honking
cars and waiting cabs. Soliciting CABBIES noticeably avoid

the freakish guy and huge, hairy lady.
JEFFERSON
We need a place to lay low. Maybe
we stay here.

WASHINGTON
I don’t exactly feel welcome.

Ross pokes her head out.

ROSS
Hey, look!

She points to a cab with an LA ZOO poster ad on top.

Jefferson looks to Washington, who shrugs in agreement.

INT. CAB FRONT SEAT - A MOMENT LATER

The DRIVER sleeps at the wheel. Jefferson knocks on the half-

open window, startling him awake.

CAB DRIVER
What?! I can wait here. Huh? Who
are you?

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
72.

JEFFERSON
Can you take us to the zoo?

CAB DRIVER
I’m on break. Any cab can take you
to the zoo!

Suddenly Washington leans into frame, looking menacing. The
driver reacts with fear.

CAB DRIVER
Okay-okay. Yeah, sure. Get in.

EXT. LOS ANGELES ZOO PARKING LOT - EVENING

Washington and Ross are just inside a wooded area, at the
far, secluded end of the lot. They are keeping hidden,
peeking toward the zoo’s front gate, where they see the last
employee car drive away, leaving the place dark.

ROSS
How long have we been here?

WASHINGTON
Too long.

Suddenly Jefferson jumps down from a tree BEHIND them.

JEFFERSON
Hey.

They turn, startled.

ROSS
What? -- We thought you were in
there.

JEFFERSON
I was. The coast is clear. C’mon.

ROSS
You got us room and board?

JEFFERSON
Even better. I got a job.

ROSS
(excited)
What?!?

JEFFERSON

We'll have money for bus tickets by
morning.

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
73.

Washington still stares at the zoo entrance, lost in thought.

WASHINGTON
Maybe this was a mistake.

JEFFERSON
What are you talking about? Good
night’s sleep. Big breakfast ...

WASHINGTON
(snaps out of it)
Huh? What? What did you say?

JEFFERSON
C’mon. We got a zoo to clean.

They head to the gate. Washington hesitates, then follows.

EXT. LA ZOO GROUNDS - NIGHT

No people. Jefferson leads a TEAM of chimps cleaning up the
grounds. They all work quickly and efficiently, making the
whole place spotless.

Ross approaches Jefferson.

ROSS
I'm impressed.

JEFFERSON
Lincoln’s not the only charming,
influential one in the family.

ROSS
That's true... What do you think
happened to him?

JEFFERSON
Some kind of mix up. I don’t know.
Where’s Washington?

ROSS
Turned in early. He’s been acting
weird since we got here.
INT. LA ZOO GORILLA CAGE - NIGHT
Washington walks around receiving stares from the other

gorillas. He too, looks them over, but in a different way. He
is looking for someone.

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
74.

Someone he doesn’t find, so he sits off in a corner by
himself and lets go a sigh as heavy as he is.

PATTY (0.S.)
Of all the gorilla cages in all the
zoos in this crazy world...

Washington perks up at the sound of her familiar, gentle, yet
worldly voice. He speaks without turning around as we see
PATTY, a female gorilla emerge from the shadows behind him.

WASHINGTON
I knew you'd be here.

PATTY
And I knew you’d come back one day.
Aren't we the smart ones? We
shoulda been chimps.

Washington smiles.

WASHINGTON

How have you been, Patty?
PATTY

Good. . . I guess.

She comes to him and they sit face to face, looking for what
was once there but is now distant, if not altogether lost.

WASHINGTON
They treat you well here?

PATTY
Of course. You?

WASHINGTON
It’s been a struggle.

PATTY
Why does that not surprise me?

WASHINGTON
What do you mean?

PATTY
You always made everything harder
than it was. Work. Us. From the day
we met to the day you left.

Washington is surprised to hear it phrased that way.

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
75.

WASHINGTON
The day I_ left? You act like I had
a choice.

PATTY

I guess not.

WASHINGTON
(angering a bit)
You guess? Being put in a cage is
one thing. But when they put your
cage on a truck and drive out of
town, it’s not like ...

PATTY
Ever wonder why you were put on
that truck?

WASHINGTON
(angered)
Because I wasn’t needed anymore--

PATTY
-- Because you were difficult!

Washington GRUNTS. He doesn’t want to hear that.

WASHINGTON
It was a difficult time.

PATTY
It was almost two days before I
even knew you were gone. Do you
know how hard that was?

WASHINGTON
Yes! Actually, I know exactly how
hard that was! It was just as hard
as finding a way back to you. But I
did it! Now it seems I came all the
way back so we could argue.

PATTY

I don’t know why you came back.
WASHINGTON

(defeated)

To see you. I just wanted to see you.
PATTY

What for?
WASHINGTON

Because I was tired of not seeing you.

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
76.

They turn to each other. She puts her head on his shoulder.

PATTY

I know it wasn’t your fault.
WASHINGTON

It’s good . . . to see you.

INT. MOONSONG THEATER LOBBY - NIGHT

A quaint but modern theater. Lincoln stands by a sign that
reads “Tonight’s Screening: Zoey's Zooing Time”. Lincoln
greets excited guests as they file in.

LINCOLN
Good to see you . . . Good to see
you .. . Thanks for coming. .
Welcome . . . Good to see you...

INT. MOONSONG THEATER - TEN MINUTES LATER

Packed house waits in anticipation as Zooing Time begins.
Lincoln stands in the back, anxious.

Onscreen is the series of close-ups of cage bars and locks.

JEFFERSON (V.O.)
It looks harmless enough from the
outside, but don’t be fooled. Life
in a zoo is no different than life
in prison. Except for one thing.
Those in prison, it can be assumed,
have committed some crime.

The shot switches to the ostrich, looking helpless and
hopeless.

OSTRICH
I never did anything wrong.

The Moonsong audience BURSTS OUT LAUGHING.
Lincoln freezes in shock as the movie continues.
JEFFERSON (0.S.)
(from the movie)
So why is it that we are forced to

live in these cages, unable to roam
free as we are meant to.

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
77.

DISSOLVING MONTAGE of the audience cracking up, and Lincoln's
rising panic. We hear snippets of animals talking from the
screen; each line spoken gets a roaring laugh.

AUDIENCE MEMBER 1
How do they do that?

AUDIENCE MEMBER 2
The animals are chewing gum. Then
they dub in the actors’ voices.
Brilliant, isn’t it?

AUDIENCE MEMBER 1
Hilarious!

More laughter as we see Lincoln, trying desperately to see
the bright side. At least they like it.

CUT TO:

INT. MOONSONG THEATER LOBBY - AN HOUR LATER

Lincoln is MOBBED by congratulatory festival-goers. Lost
brother aside, he can’t help but be swept up in the
attention. Press microphones are thrust at him.

REPORTER (0.S.)
What’s next for you, Lincoln?

LINCOLN
I'd just like to finish the
festival, see where we are and go
from there.

REPORTER 2 (0.S.)
You think Hollywood's ready for you?

LINCOLN
We’1ll soon find out, won't we?

Crowd laughter.
REPORTER 3 (0.S.)
Hey, Lincoln! Where’d you get the
idea for your movie?
Lincoln gulps, suddenly brought back to reality.
LINCOLN

Uh, well. Actually my brother had a
lot to do with it.

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
78.

REPORTER 2
He must be one funny guy!

The crowd laughs in agreement.

LINCOLN
No, he’s not. I mean, he is, but
it’s just that --

REPORTER 2 (0.S.)
Where is that wacky brother of
yours, anyway?

LINCOLN
I don’t... I mean I’m not sure,
exactly .

On Lincoln’s saddened face we...

DISSOLVE TO:

LA ZOO GROUNDS - NIGHT

Jefferson walking along, ELATED. He climbs up a bench and
jumps over the back as he heads past an arrow sign that
reads: GORILLAS.

At the gorilla cage, Jefferson looks in and sees Washington
in an intimate cuddle with Patty. His eyes widen in surprise.

JEFFERSON
A-hem.

Washington and Patty look up.

JEFFERSON
I have some great news.

PATTY
(sees shaved Jefferson)
Goodness! What happened to you?

WASHINGTON
(to Patty)
It’s a long story.
(to Jefferson)
What is it?

JEFFERSON
Sorry to -ahem - interrupt. I
already made enough money for one
bus ticket. If I go in the bag, we
can leave tonight.

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
79.

PATTY
A bus ticket?!

JEFFERSON
You two . . . know each other?

PATTY
So I guess I wasn’t the purpose of
this trip.

WASHINGTON
You were the purpose of my trip.
Jefferson has his own reasons for
being here.

 

PATTY
What reasons?

JEFFERSON
(confused)
It’s about a movie we made.

Patty looks surprised. Washington winces.

PATTY
(to Washington)
You made another movie?

Now it’s Jefferson who is surprised.

JEFFERSON
Another movie?

Patty laughs.

PATTY
(to Washington)
He doesn’t know? I should have
guessed. Mr. Secret.
(to Jefferson)
Your friend here was a movie star.

WASHINGTON
Patty, don’t.

JEFFERSON
A what?!?!?

PATTY
It was years ago, but he was the
most sought-after gorilla in the
business. You made - what? - five
pictures?

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
80.

Washington sighs. He’s not going to avoid this talk, as much
as he’d like to.

WASHINGTON
Six.

PATTY
(to Jefferson)
Let’s see, there was Jungle Escape,
Return to the Jungle, Jungle
Hunters, Jungle Dawn, Night of the
Living Jungle...

WASHINGTON
Let’s not forget my comedy...

Washington leaves them.
PATTY
Oh yeah. Jungle Bungle. Ever heard
of those?

Jefferson nods enthusiastically, but after only a second,
shifts to shaking his head no.
JEFFERSON
But my brother would know them!
He’s the movie expert. He’s at the
Moonsong Film Festival right now,
with our documentary...

PATTY
Moonsong . . . impressive.

Jefferson looks in the direction Washington went. Patty feels
sorry to have brought it up that way.

JEFFERSON
I better...

PATTY
Yeah.
EXT LA ZOO GRASSY HILL - NIGHT
Washington sits by himself, stargazing. He sighs.
Jefferson appears at the bottom of the hill.

JEFFERSON
Mind if I come up?

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
81.

WASHINGTON
I guess not.

Jefferson ascends and sits down next to the big gorilla.

JEFFERSON
Doesn't seem like anything to be
ashamed of. Being in movies, I mean.

WASHINGTON
I’m not ashamed. I loved that work.
(pause)
And I admire your passion. I once
had passion like you do. For the
movies. For Patty.

JEFFERSON
What happened?

WASHINGTON
I woke up one morning and instead
of being taken to work, I was taken
to the Chicago zoo.

JEFFERSON
Wow. I’m sorry.
(thinks )
That’s the story we should have
told in the movie.

No response. Jefferson lets out a nervous laugh.

JEFFERSON
Next time.

They sit quietly for a few moments.

WASHINGTON
Next time.

Jefferson smiles.
JEFFERSON
I take it you won’t be coming to
Colorado with us.
Washington just shakes his head.
JEFFERSON
You take care of yourself. And your

friend, too. She must be pretty
special.

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
82.

WASHINGTON
She is. . . Same for you and Ross.

JEFFERSON
Huh? Me? Ross? We’re not - together.

WASHINGTON
Whatever you say.

Jefferson stands.

JEFFERSON
So I guess I’1ll see you around?

WASHINGTON
I can’t imagine how.

Jefferson shrugs agreement, and Washington holds out his
massive hand to shake. Jefferson shakes it.

WASHINGTON
I’1ll see you around.
INT. BUS - LATE NIGHT
A tired Jefferson sits by the window looking out and the
sparse highway traffic. A large BACKPACK sits in the empty
seat next to him.

INT. MOONSONG HOTEL HALLWAY - SIMULTANEOUS

CLOSE ON elevator door as it opens, revealing Lincoln. As he
steps out a BELLHOP who was waiting gets on.

BELLHOP
You’re the man!

Lincoln smiles and as the elevator door closes and Lincoln
walks away toward his room...

LINCOLN
(to himself)
Yes, that was the whole shaving,
tricky plan part of it...

INT. MOONSONG HOTEL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Expensive room. Lincoln comes in and is surprised to find

gifts of all kinds: flowers, champagne, fruit, everything set
up all around the room.

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
83.

He spots the phone blinking and pushes the message button.

PHONE VOICE
You have thirty-one messages.

Lincoln picks up the phone, then stops himself.

LINCOLN
Nah. Let ‘em wait. I’m the man.

He hangs up and goes into the bathroom. A moment later we
hear Ethan’s electric razor turn on.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. BUS - DAWN

Jefferson sleeps uncomfortably in his seat, his head pressed
against the window. Ross’ head now sticks out of the backpack
and she sleeps leaning on his arm.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. LINCOLN’S HOTEL ROOM - SIMULTANEOUS

Lincoln sleeps blissfully in his 5-Star bed, wearing silk
pajamas and a hotel eye shade.

A KNOCK at the door wakes him up. He listens. Another KNOCK.

ETHAN (0.S.)
(from hallway)
Room Service. Breakfast.

LINCOLN

(groggy)
I didn’t order anything.

ETHAN (0.S.)
(from hallway)
Compliments of one of the studios,
Mr. Lincoln.

Lincoln smiles, gets up and opens the door, revealing the
BACK of Ethan, dressed as room service waiter.

LINCOLN
Thanks. Just bring it on in.

Lincoln moves aside as Ethan BACKS in pulling the breakfast

cart, keeping his face hidden. Lincoln closes the door and
turns to see --

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
84.

ETHAN! Back for revenge.

ETHAN
Gotcha!

Lincoln jumps for the door, but Ethan DIVES across the
breakfast cart, blocking him.

Lincoln runs to the bed. Ethan follows in chase and dives
again, but Lincoln evades and Ethan crashes into the
nightstand.

Lincoln heads into the bathroom, but before he can shut the
door, Ethan shoves his foot in. Ethan crashes in and slams
the door.

We HEAR the crashing fight in the bathroom for a few moments
and then it suddenly STOPS.

ETHAN (0.S.)
(disgusted)
What did you do to my razor?!?!

The crashing fight continues, ending with the ringing THUMP
of Ethan falling (presumably headfirst) into the tub. A
moment later the shower turns on.

Lincoln rushes out into the room, wedges a chair under the
bathroom doorknob, and quickly half-dresses. Grabbing the
rest of his clothes - and the video camera - he runs out.

INT. HOTEL ELEVATOR - MOMENTS LATER

Lincoln, now fully dressed, stands alone, the camera pointed
at himself.

POV CAMERA VIEWFINDER.
Lincoln’s close-up, slightly off-center face.

LINCOLN
I’ve got good news and bad news.
The good news is: Everyone loved
the movie. It’s called Zooing Time
now. I’1ll explain later. The awards
are tonight. I think we could
actually win! Now for the bad news:
First, I’m being chased by a guy
who pretty much wants to kill me.
Again, I'll explain later. More
importantly, though, everyone
thinks our movie is a comedy.

(MORE )

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
85.
LINCOLN (cont'd)
No one took it seriously - But we
still might win!

The elevator opens in the lobby and Lincoln rushes out.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY CONCIERGE DESK - A MOMENT LATER

Lincoln nearly crashes into the desk. He puts the camera and
his room key card down.

LINCOLN
Hi!

CONCIERGE
Ah, good morning Mr. Lincoln. What
can I do --?

LINCOLN
-- If you see my brother. My, uh,
twin brother. Give him this camera
and my room key. Got it?

CONCIERGE
But of course. Happy to --

The elevator DINGS and opens. A soaking wet Ethan emerges.

LINCOLN
-- Gotta go.

Lincoln runs out the front door. Ethan follows, slipping on
his wet shoes and causing a ruckus as he passes.
EXT. HOTEL - A MOMENT LATER

Lincoln looks frantically for help, but there is none. Then
he sees a cab pulling up and beckons it to hurry.

LINCOLN
C’mon! C’mon!

But it suddenly stops far down the curb.

LINCOLN
No!

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
86.

INT. CAB - SIMULTANEOUS

Jefferson sits in the back seat. Ross pokes her head out of
the backpack.

JEFFERSON
Maybe we should just get out here.
I don’t want to cause a scene at
the front door.

ROSS
Are you sure?

JEFFERSON
Just until we know what’s going on.
I mean, you probably need some sort
of ID badge or something to even
get in.

ROSS
Well I guess so.
EXT. HOTEL - CONTINUOUS
Fed up, Lincoln starts to run toward the cab, when suddenly
he is SNATCHED UP by Ethan and thrown into the back of a
black SUV. Ethan jumps into the driver seat and speeds off -

nearly hitting Jefferson as he gets out of the cab.

JEFFERSON
Whoa - maniac!

Jefferson shakes his head and puts the backpack on.

On his way to the front door, he is surprised by all the
people smiling and waving to him. The doorman rushes to get
the door for him.

DOORMAN
Good morning, Mr. Lincoln.

JEFFERSON
Oh, I’m not --

Ross’ hand shoots out of the backpack and BONKS Jefferson on
the back of the head.

JEFFERSON
Good morning.

He hurries inside.

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
87.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY - CONTINUOUS
Jefferson is awestruck by the opulence.

JEFFERSON
Holy wow.

Ross pokes her head out.

ROSS
You mean holy c --
(notices)
-- wow!!!

They stare wide-eyed, Jefferson slowly turns, giving them a
360-view of the ornate, lavish room.

He finishes the turn and stands face to face with the
concierge. Ross and Franklin duck down.

CONCIERGE
You must be Mr. Lincoln’s brother.

JEFFERSON
Yes! How did you know?

CONCIERGE
Lucky guess. He asked me to give
these to you.

The concierge hands Jefferson the camera and room key card
and leaves him. Jefferson hands the camera over his shoulder.
Ross takes it and immediately begins filming the room.

JEFFERSON
The guys back home are never gonna
believe this.

ROSS (0.S.)
I think they will.

He looks back and sees she’s filming.
JEFFERSON
Ah. Good idea. -
(points)
Get that thing over there!

She turns the camera where he points. After a moment he looks
down at the room key card.

ROOM 402.

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
88.

INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - MINUTES LATER
CLOSE ON the door for room 402.

Jefferson puts the key card in and is rewarded with a little
green light and BEEP. As Ross looks over his shoulders, he
opens the door to find ...

INT. HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The room is RANSACKED from the recent struggle. Jefferson
puts the backpack down and Ross climbs out.

ROSS
This is not good.

JEFFERSON
Hang on. We don’t know exactly what
happened here. Let’s focus on what
we do know. We do know that
whatever happened here . .

ROSS
...Wasn’t good.

JEFFERSON
Lincoln would have left a message.

ROSS
Doesn’t look like he had time.

JEFFERSON
He would have found a way. I know
it. Look around.

They look through the mess for any sign. Jefferson absent-
mindedly picks up the camera and taps it to his temple.

JEFFERSON
Think, think, think. If you were
Lincoln, how would you try to
contact us?

ROSS
Stage a scene and film it.

JEFFERSON
(laughs )
Yeah, right.
(eureka! )
Yeah! Right! Of course!

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
89.

He frantically rewinds the tape inside and pushes play. They
huddle around the viewfinder and are relieved to see the
close-up of Lincoln in the elevator.

LINCOLN

(from camera)
I’ve got good news and bad news.
The good news is: Everyone loved
the movie. It’s called Zooing Time
now. I’1ll explain later. The awards
are tonight. I think we could
actually win! Now for the bad news:
First, I’m being chased by a guy
who pretty much wants to kill me.
Again, I'll explain later. More
importantly, though, everyone
thinks our movie is ---

 

Suddenly the screen cuts to the hotel lobby, the footage Ross
just shot downstairs.

Jefferson and Ross look at each other in a panic.

ROSS
Too much bad news is never good.

JEFFERSON
(from camera)
The guys back home are never gonna
believe we were here.

ROSS
(from camera)
I think they will.
JEFFERSON
(from camera)
Ah. Good idea. Get that over there!
Jefferson shuts it off.

JEFFERSON
What are we gonna do --??

Suddenly there is a rattle and the KEY BEEP at the door. The
two of them dive under the bed just as Ethan returns.

They can only see his trendy ORANGE TIP shoes, and have no
idea who he is - only that he can lead them to Lincoln.

Ethan sits on the bed and dials the bedside table phone.

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
90.

ETHAN
Hey, it’s me. That little freak who
railroaded me and stole my
screening spot? Let’s just say he
won't be bothering me any more.

Jefferson and Ross suppress a gasp.

ETHAN
What? No, I didn’t throw him in a
river with cement shoes! I’m at a
film festival! I’m not in a film!

Jefferson and Ross sigh relief.

ETHAN
I’m going to the awards show
tonight and I’m gonna fix this
mess! I’1ll talk to you later.

Ethan hangs up, quickly stands and leaves. The two monkeys
try to get a look at his face, but can’t.

JEFFERSON
Follow him!

They run for the door and as Jefferson reaches for the
doorknob, it BEEPS again and TURNS from the outside.

Ross quickly stands on Jefferson’s shoulders behind the
opening door.

Ethan barges back in. The door CRUNCHES against Jefferson and
Ross. Ethan heads toward his sunglasses, which he left on the
bedside table. As he walks over to them, the door swings
closed revealing the monkeys to Ethan's back.

Jefferson’s arms are full holding Ross, so at the last
second, he uses his tail to grab the doorknob - just before
it closes - and quickly pull it back open to cover them -
just as Ethan turns back around.

Ethan walks quickly out, grabbing the doorknob and slamming
it shut behind him.

Unfortunately, Jefferson’s tail is still wrapped around the
knob on the inside, so Ethan’s tug pulls Jefferson down,
toppling both of them.

Ross lands on her head and is knocked out cold.

Jefferson sneaks out after Ethan.

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
gl.

A moment later he returns, having noticed Ross wasn’t with

him.

JEFFERSON
Ross? Ross! Are you okay?

He gently shakes her and she comes to.

ROSS
Huh? Where is he? Did you get a
look at him?

JEFFERSON
No, he got on the elevator.

ROSS
He said he’s going to the awards
show. We’ll catch him there.

JEFFERSON
How will we know who he is? How
will we get in?

ROSS
(thinks )
You go - as Lincoln.

JEFFERSON
No, I can’t. The crowd - What if we
win? I’ll have to give a speech.

ROSS
That’ll be perfect! Everyone will
be cheering - except our guy. Take
that stage and you can I-D him!

JEFFERSON
Can’t we just sneak in and look for
orange-tip shoes?

Ross just looks at him, letting him realize on his own how

dumb an idea that is.

ROSS
It could be our only chance to find
Lincoln. Plus, if you do win, do
you realize what that means?

JEFFERSON
That I'll have to speak in front of
hundreds of people.

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
92.

ROSS
It means your movie was accepted by
humans. Everything you've been
working for . . . the cause. .
It’s all a success. You did it.

JEFFERSON
(thinks )
I don’t know...
Suddenly Ross KISSES him. He’s shocked, but he likes it.

ROSS
You can do this. I believe in you.

Dazed, Jefferson goes into the bathroom and shuts the door. A
moment later, we hear Ethan’s razor.

CUT TO:

INT. MOONSONG THEATER LOBBY - NIGHT
The large room is empty except for Jefferson - NOW BALD and
in a TUX -- paces nervously by the concession counter. We
hear the DIN of applause in the theater. The awards show is
underway.
JEFFERSON
You can do this. You can do this.

INT. THEATER — SIMULTANEOUS

High above the stage, hidden in the lighting fixtures, sits
Ross. She searches the audience.

ROSS
I hope he can do this.

Onstage, a PRESENTER stands at the podium.
PRESENTER
And the Audience Selection Award
for the Best Picture goes to ...
Zooing Time by Lincoln!

The crowd erupts in applause, then looks around. The
presenter is left on stage holding the award.

Above, Ross looks around, disappointed.

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
93.

PRESENTER (0.S.)
Uh, I guess Lincoln couldn’t make
it tonight.

PRESENTER
- I'd like to accept this award on
his behalf, and --

JEFFERSON (0.S.)
-- Wait! I’m here!

Jefferson stands back of the theater. The crowd erupts again
in applause as they turn to see him.

Jefferson walks all the way to the stage, to rapturous
applause. Strangers reach out to shake his hand. As nervous
as he is, he can’t help feeling proud. Maybe Ross was right.

Maybe the cause has succeeded.
FROM THE RAFTERS Ross watches him, beaming with pride.

Onstage, Jefferson takes the award, and stares at the
microphone. The applause die down and Jefferson moves no
closer to the podium.

The presenter lowers the mic for Jefferson, then moves aside
and holds out his hand, coaxing Jefferson to speak.

Jefferson slinks up to the podium and arrives just in time to
have his nervous GULP amplified throughout the theater.

Everyone laughs.

JEFFERSON
I'm... I’m not very good at this.
Speaking in front of people, I’m
afraid. Thank you, so much for this
honor. I’m glad you liked In the Cage
-- uh, I mean, Zooing Time.

The audience laughs and claps.

JEFFERSON
It’s a serious issue we address in
the movie, and I hope that now that
you've seen the other side, we can
begin to work toward real change.

The audience is SILENT. Then one person’s laughter incites a

cheering, clapping laugh riot. It seems only the cheers and
applause register with Jefferson.

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
94.

JEFFERSON
We can live together in peace! We
can! We can! We can!

RIOTOUS LAUGHTER. Some audience members even take up the “We
Can!” chant - just for laughs.

Jefferson raises the award in his fist triumphantly and
receives another CHEER.

IN THE RAFTERS: Suddenly Ross sees Ethan, motionless with a
look of angry bewilderment on his face.

Jefferson bounds off the stage toward the wings, but can’t
help turning back for one more victory stance - this time
both hands raised high.

The crowd goes berserk.

Ross watches Ethan push toward the aisle and walk quickly out
the back of the theater. Ross climbs along the ceiling

fixtures, directly over him.

His orange-tip shoes are clearly visible.

EXT. MOONSONG THEATER - NIGHT

Several ACTIVISTS from the group HAHA (HUMAN AGAINST HURTING
ANIMALS) stand in protest, carrying signs that read STOP
ANIMAL EXPLOITATION!; CAGES ARE NOT FUNNY!; and a circled,
red-slashed words ZOOING TIME.

Jefferson comes out, hounded by reporters. Ethan approaches,
but can’t get near him through the crowd.

Ross stays hidden, trying to get Jefferson's attention.
Jefferson sees the protest group and go right to them.
JEFFERSON
Thank you. Thank you so much for

coming!

People are cracking up at what they see as “Lincoln's”
audacity. The activists BOO Jefferson.

ACTIVIST 1
How could you?!?

ACTIVIST 2
You should be ashamed of yourself!

Jefferson stops and looks behind himself, confused.

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055

JEFFERSON
What are you talking about?

ACTIVIST 1
Making fun of poor, helpless zoo
animals. You’re not funny!

JEFFERSON
Making fun -- huh?

ACTIVIST 2
Yeah, you’re the animal.

JEFFERSON
(surprised)
How did you --? Look, that has
nothing to do with it.

Suddenly, Jefferson sees Ross in a tree above the protestors.
She frantically points to Ethan heading toward his car.
JEFFERSON
Look, I gotta go. You got it all
wrong. I’m on your side.

More BOOS from the activists as Jefferson rushes off.

CUT TO:

EXT. ROADWAY - NIGHT

A helmeted, goggled Jefferson does his best to steer a VESPA.
Ahead of them are the taillights of Ethan’s black SUV.

Jefferson keeps a safe distance as Ethan pulls into the dirt
parking lot of THE SILVER SCREEN ROADSIDE MOTEL.
INT. ROADSIDE MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Lincoln is tied to a chair in the middle of the sparse, dumpy
room. One lamp is lit.

He doesn’t seem phased as he watches a classic black-and-
white movie on the meager TV.

When he hears Ethan’s car pull up outside and the car door
open and close, he quickly uses his tail on the remote to
turn off the TV.

As Ethan unlocks the room door and rushes in, Lincoln adopts
a much more anguished look on his face.

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
96.

Ethan is SHOCKED to see Lincoln still there.

ETHAN
How?!?!? How did you do it?!
LINCOLN
(thinks )
The remote was right there on the
bed.
ETHAN

Don’t play games with me! How did
you get to that ceremony?! And how
did you get back here and tie
yourself up?!?!

LINCOLN
What?

Ethan starts frantically searching the room.

ETHAN
Where is it?! Where did you hide
the Award?!? It’s mine!

LINCOLN
What awar-- ? .... We won?

ETHAN
You didn’t win! You stole that
award! From me! I was supposed to

 

win!
LINCOLN
(to himself)
We won.
ETHAN

Where is it?!?!?

Ethan lunges for the defenseless Lincoln, but there is a
KNOCK at the door. Ethan stops and answers it.

No one is there. As he leans out and checks left and right,
Jefferson slides the window open, climbs into the room and
tiptoes to the door, PUSHING it shut and PUSHING Ethan out.
Jefferson runs to Lincoln, untying him.

JEFFERSON
Are you alright?

LINCOLN
We won?

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
97.

JEFFERSON
They thought it was a joke.

LINCOLN
I know. Sorry about that. Didn’t
you get my message?

JEFFERSON
Uh.... yeah. Most of it.
LINCOLN
But we won?
JEFFERSON
Yeah. We won. Now how do we get out
of here?
LINCOLN

I have a plan.

As Lincoln is freed, the door is unlocked and opened. Ethan
comes back in and is dumbstruck by Lincoln's double.

ETHAN
You... It can’t be ... Two of you?

Just then, a crash by the window as Ross climbs in.

ROSS
I don’t see him.

Ethan is stunned silent at the sight of the talking monkey.
She SEES Ethan and realizes she just spoke in front of him.

ROSS
(monkey sounds)
Ooh-ooh-ahh-ahh.

ETHAN
This isn’t happening. This can’t be
happening!

LINCOLN
Get him!

The three monkeys CHARGE at Ethan.

CUT TO:
INT. ROADSIDE MOTEL ROOM - A MINUTE LATER
Lincoln, Jefferson and Ross are now ALL tied to chairs. Ethan

paces back and forth, scheming.

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
98.

JEFFERSON
Get him? That was your big plan?

LINCOLN
It could've worked.

JEFFERSON
This isn’t a movie. This is real life.

ETHAN
Quiet, you two. Okay, here’s the
thing. You will give me my award. I
will send the Moonsong officials -
and the police - here and you will
explain to them what you did to me.

Suddenly there is a knock at the door.

ETHAN
Go away! I’m busy!

MALE VOICE (0.S.)
(from outside)
Room Service!

Ethan looks confused. Lincoln lights up a bit.

LINCOLN
I was hungry.

ETHAN
(fuming)

You called -- ?
Ethan angrily opens the door. As soon as he does --
-- a GIANT GORILLA ARM thrusts in and grabs him by the
throat, lifting him off of the ground, causing his shoes to
fall off.
Washington enters, looking meaner than King Kong.

WASHINGTON
Is there a problem here?

Ethan turns even WHITER with fear. He gasps for breath.

ETHAN
You're . . . talking! How?
Please...please .... I’1l do
anything....just don’t hurt me...

Washington lifts him higher, then ROARS at the top of his
lungs, causing Ethan to FAINT from fear.

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
99.

He tosses Ethan on the bed and unties his friends.

EXT. ROADSIDE MOTEL - NIGHT

Lincoln. Jefferson , Ross and Washington get in Ethan’s SUV.
Washington is in the driver's seat.

JEFFERSON
You sure you can drive this thing?

WASHINGTON
I take it you never saw Night of
the Living Jungle.
Lincoln suddenly realizes.

LINCOLN
Wait. That was you?

Washington looks back toward the motel.

WASHINGTON
You coming?

Patty comes out of the room.
PATTY
Just tidying up a bit. Quite a mess
in there.

As she joins them, Lincoln looks confused.

PATTY
I’m Patty. Nice to meet you.

LINCOLN
Likewise.

They pile into the car and drive off.

EXT. CHICAGO ZOO SQUARE - NIGHT

The old gang is back again, this time listening to Washington
and Patty telling stories of their old Hollywood days. Most
enraptured is Lincoln, who sits front and center.

Ross and Jefferson, clearly a couple, holding hands, also
look on. Franklin approaches them.

ROSS
Hey, Fraklin. Did you miss me?

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
Jefferson

100.

FRANKLIN
Did you go somewhere?
ROSS
Very funny. What have you been up

to?

FEMALE SPIDER MONKEYS (0.S.)
Franklin! C’mon!

and Ross look to see two cute, teeny-bopper spider

monkeys sitting in the low branches of a tree. They look back
to Franklin.

FRANKLIN
Nothin’ much. Catch you later.

He leaves. Ross and Jefferson laugh and shake their heads.

They turn
Jefferson

The crowd

The crowd

their attention back to the crowd - but not before
sneaks a couple of glances back at the girls.

PATTY
Tell them about the time the star
got stuck in his trailer.

WASHINGTON
Oh, they don’t want to hear that
again....
BEGS him.

WASHINGTON

I have a better idea. Why don’t we
hear from Lincoln, who had a real
Hollywood adventure. Danger,
action, intrigue...

(to Lincoln)
Whaddya say?

encourages him, so Lincoln takes center stage.

LINCOLN
There I was . . . tied to a chair
with no way out. My captor on his

way back...

Ross and Jefferson laugh and shake their heads.

DISSOLVE TO:

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
101.

EXT. CHICAGO ZOO SQUARE - NIGHT

It’s winter now, but the same crowd has gathered again to
hear the latest version of the story from Lincoln.

LINCOLN
All I had to do was get to that
lamp, break it open and use the
electrical current to burn through
the ropes...

Jefferson’s eyes go wide at this latest embellishment. He
motions to Ross that maybe they should take a walk.
EXT. ZOO GROUNDS - MINUTES LATER

Ross and Jefferson walk arm in arm, enjoying the silence and,
of course, each other’s company.

CHEETAH (0.S.)
Pssssst!

They stop walking and are surprised to see a strange CHEETAH
outside the zoo fence.

JEFFERSON
Can I help you?

CHEETAH
Are you Lincoln?

JEFFERSON
No, Lincoln is my brother.

CHEETAH
He made Zooing Time?

ROSS
Actually, Jefferson here is the
mastermind behind Zooing Time.

CHEETAH
Oh, I guess I came to meet you,
then.

JEFFERSON
That's very nice -- huh? Wait a

minute. Where are you from?

CHEETAH
San Diego.

@Michaal Mallin / wea #11NR055
102.

JEFFERSON
How did you see Zooing Time?

CHEETAH
Are you kidding? Everyone’s seen
it.

JEFFERSON
Everyone?

CHEETAH
Sure. There are bootleg copies in
every zoo in the country. Probably
the world by now.

JEFFERSON
Are you serious?

CHEETAH
Yeah. Everyone wants to meet you.
I’m just the fastest.

JEFFERSON
Yes, cheetahs are fast - and proud
of it. We know.

CHEETAH
No, I mean. I just ran ahead.

The cheetah motions behind him with his head. Jefferson and
Ross look.

At first they see only the dark night, but as their eyes
adjust to the hillside, they see a PILGRIMAGE of zoo animals
making their way toward the fence. There are hundreds, maybe
thousands of silhouettes getting closer and closer.

Jefferson is choked up almost to tears.

ROSS
Looks like the cause is alive and
well.
Jefferson nods.
ROSS
You gonna be able to talk to all of
them?
JEFFERSON

I think so. Yeah.

END
OVER END CREDITS

The film geek security guard watches the end credits of yet
another DVD. He hits a button on the remote and the DVD shuts
off, switching the screen to regular TV.

Onscreen is a cheesy entertainment “reporter”. Emblazoned in
the lower right corner of the screen is a logo for BIZ BUZZ.

BIZ BUZZ GUY
I'm here following up on another
Lincoln sighting. No, not the
sixteenth President of the United
States, we’re talking about the
missing filmmaker. You may recall
last year Biz Buzz brought you the
exclusive story about the guy who
came out of nowhere, took the top
prize at the Moonsong Film
Festival, and then vanished. Just
like that. Since then the rumors
have been flying, and people are
coming from all over the world,
claiming to have seen the cinematic
genius. Like the folks here in this
small California town, who say
Lincoln himself came into their
diner just two nights ago. I talked
to them earlier.

An old man - short order cook.

OLD MAN
I don’t read those celebrity movie
magazines. Wife does, but I don’t.
He had the turkey club. That much I
know.

An old woman - cashier.

OLD WOMAN
It was him alright. I recognized
him from the pictures on TV, but I
didn’t want to let him know that I
knew what I knew. . . about him
being him, I mean.

A middle-aged man - diner patron.
DINER PATRON
He was hinting that he worked for
the government.

DINER PATRON (cont'd)
I figured that’s why he had to drop
out of the movie scene. Can’t be

covert and famous, right? . . . Too
bad, too. Real funny movie that guy
made.

A waiter we see from the back brings the man his food.

BIZ BUZZ GUY (0.S.)
How about you, sir, did you see
him.

Biz Buzz camera keeps the waiter in frame as he turns around.
It's ETHAN LATTE, looking like a defeated mess.

ETHAN
See who? What are you talking
about?

BIZ BUZZ GUY (0.S.)
Lincoln, the missing genius
filmmaker.

Ethan FREAKS OUT and runs into the kitchen, breaking things
along the way.

Biz Buzz shot goes back to Biz Buzz guy outside the diner.

BIZ BUZZ GUY
As you can see, it’s a very emotional
story. Seems like every time we dig
for answers, all we uncover is more
questions. Now allegations that
Lincoln is actually a government
agent. Did he disappear so suddenly
to protect his identity? Was he
called on a top secret mission? Or
was it something else? Was his
disappearance by choice at all? We
talked to a former government agent
who declined to be shown on camera.

Close-up of shadowy figure.
GOVT AGENT
If he is an agent, and I’m not at
liberty to say if he is or not
- and he made a movie, came into
the spotlight like that, there’d be
trouble. That I can tell you.
The film geek zoo security guard shuts off the TV.
