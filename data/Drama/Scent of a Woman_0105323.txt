EXT. THE BAIRD SCHOOL - WILTON, NEW HAMPSHIRE - “MORNING 1

A New England prep school straddling the prettiest section of
town, a chapel and belfry commanding a grassy quadrangle
surrounded by ivy-covered classroom structures and the marble
arches of an administration building.

The great black iron bell in the belfry RINGS, the SCRAPING of
wooden chairs against wooden floors, doors rocket open and the
cream of adolescent America pours forth onto the gravel paths
intersecting the lawn: these youths are the future of the
nation’s banking, law and medicine, perhaps even The White
House, all draped in versions of oxford cloth and tweed and gray
flannel, tight knots of ties overlapping the thick fuzz of
crewnecks.

INT. ADMINISTRATION BUILDING - MORNING 2

The mid-morning crush at the students’ mailboxes, a noisy place
with combination locks being spun open and slammed shut, the
racket blunted by the steady march of delinquent students up
worn marble steps leading to the Dean’s and Bursar’s offices.
However, downstairs there is the happy activity of the
mid-morning break, clusters of gossipers, the excitement of
plans being hatched. Nearby hangs a bulletin board, decorated
with plastic turkeys. Standing in front of it, a good-looking
kid whose cut-rate haircut and J.c. Penney coat-and-tie don’t
fit in with the Preppie platoons. His name is CHARLIE SIMMS,
17, and he is scanning the sparse entries under "Student Aid,
Jobs, Thanksgiving Weekend".

EXT. ADMINISTRATION BUILDING - MORNING 3 |

A_new maroon Jaguar pulls into the #1 parking spot. Out steps
DEAN TRASK, an avuncular man in his 50’s, the obligatory
schoolmaster’s cozy bow tie and blue blazer, however the face
bears more the flinty expression of a labor negotiator or
baseball front office man.

Observing Trask from in front of the Administration Building,
another group of students, HARRY HAVEMEYER, 18, a
born-to-the-purple prep school prince, GEORGE WILLIS, 17,
Harry’s consort, and two aides of Harry’s, TRENT and JIMMY.

HARRY
Will you look at this?

GEORGE
I can’t believe it, they really gave
it to hin.

HARRY “

Now he’s a loser with a Jaguar.

Dean Trask locks the car, gives it a last, cherishing look and
heads for the Administration Building. Harry breaks off from
his cohorts and angles across the yard to cut him off. é

HARRY (contd)
Dean Trask!
 

 

   

TRASK
Good morning, Havemeyer.

HARRY
Good morning, sir. Fabulous.

TRASK
What’s fabulous?

HARRY
That’s some piece of steel you got.

TRASK
You don’t think I deserve it?

Harry holds the door open for Dean Trask as he enters the
Administration Building.

INT. ADMINISTRATION BUILDING - DAY
Harry pursues Trask as he moves down the lobby.

HARRY
...No sir, I think it’s great. Why
should the head of Baird be
putt-putting around in some junker?
I think the Board of Trustees have had
their first stroke of inspiration in
some time.

TRASK
Well thank you, Havemeyer, I’11 take
that at face value.

Leaving Harry behind, Trask enters his office where he is
greeted by MRS. HUNSAKER, 55, his no-nonsense, New England
secretary. She has four delinquents waiting in chairs in front
of her, their pink Dean’s slips balled up in sweaty palms.
Trask passes by.

TRASK (contd)
Good morning, Mrs. Hunsaker.
(to the boys)
What have we here, Murderers’ Row?

He chuckles, delighted by his own turn of phrase, and enters his
inner office.

Across the lobby Harry, withdrawing an envelope from his
mailbox, meets up with his followers, Georges Trent and Jimny,
who have joined him inside. Charlie is still at the bulletin
board.

GEORGE
What was all that?

HARRY
Nothing.

e
GEORGE
C’mon, Harry --

HARRY
Nothing. Just saying hello. I always
enjoy saying hello to Dean Trask.
Harry opens the envelope, smiles.
HARRY (contd)
Sugarbush. Lift tickets and condo
vouchers.

JIMMY
I thought we were going to Stowe.

GEORGE
Sugarbush is Stowe, Jimmy.

 

A bell RINGS, the lobby starts to clear but Charlie continues

to examine the job opportunities.

HARRY
...We’re doing it right, Thanksgiving
in Vermont, Christmas in Switzerland --

JIMMY

Christmas in Guh-staad is going to
cost us --

HARRY
Staad, the ‘G’ is silent. George?

GEORGE
‘Staad.

HARRY
Trent?

TRENT
‘Staad.

Harry turns back to Jimmy.

HARRY
So what about ‘Staad?

JIMMY
The ‘G’ may be silent but it costs
three G’s to get there. I’11 have to
talk to my father.

HARRY
Better yet, why doesn’t my father talk
to your father. :

to class.

 

Behind them, Charlie is having difficulty concentrating on the
listings as the snobbish, but good-natured, dispute continues.

The bell rings again, the lobby empties as students hurry out
 

EXT. ADMINISTRATION BUILDING - DAY

Charlie bumps into Harry and George as they all squeeze out the
door, Jimmy and Trent following close behind as the group
proceeds up a narrow path of the grassy quadrangle.

GEORGE
(to Charlie)
You going home this weekend?

CHARLIE
I don’t know.

GEORGE
Going home to fucking Idaho for
Thanksgiving?

CHARLIE
I’m from Oregon.

GEORGE
I meant fucking Oregon.

HARRY
(to Charlie)
How do you feel about skiing? In the
mood for the white-bosomed slopes of
Vermont?

CHARLIE
Umm --

HARRY
We got a deal going, kid. 20% off for
my friends. My dad arranged it.
Christmas in Switzerland --

JIMMY
*Staad --

HARRY .
Gstaad. Dropping the ‘G’ is phony.
JIMMY
You just said everybody says ‘Staad.

HARRY
Not if you’ve been there.
to Charlie)
Easter in Bermuda. Then, Kentucky
Derby weekend. We could work you in,
son.

CHARLIE
How much are the \‘white-bosomed slopes
of Vermont’?
 

 

HARRY
Twelve hundred dollars. Included is
a nine-course champagne Thanksgiving
dinner.

CHARLIE
Twelve hundred dollars is a little
rich for my blood, Harry.

HARRY
How short are you?

Charlie smiles.

CHARLIE
How short, Harry? So short it
wouldn’t be worth the trouble for you
and George to measure. But thanks for
asking.

Charlie breaks off, heads for class.

GEORGE
(to Harry)
What’d you do that for? You know he’s
on Aid --

HARRY
On major holidays, Willis, it is
customary for the lord of the manor
to offer drippings to the poor.

EXT. TOWN OF WILTON - DAY

Past the mill, across the river, above the noisy waterworks
there is a blue-collar section, frame houses dark with soot.
Charlie unfolds the squares of the piece of paper on which he
copied down an address from the bulletin board. He checks a
number, heads up the sidewalk, rings the bell. KAREN ROSSI, 26,
answers, two children squeezed against her legs and pulling at
the seams of her jeans, FRANCINE, 4, blonde bangs, a mischievous
smile and very dangerous, and WILLIE, 2, who does what Francine
tells hin.

CHARLIE
Mrs. Rossi..?

Karen looks Charlie up and down, he again checks his slip of
paper against the plastic dry wall numbers beside the door,
Karen smiles ingratiatingly.

CHARLIE (contd) ~
16 Water Street -- ? I’m here about
the weekend job?

KAREN
Come on in.

INT. ROSSI HOUSE - DAY

Karen shows Charlie inside, Francine and Willie still clinging
to her.

KAREN
Get out of the way, Francie --

FRANCINE
Has he got pimples? He hates pimples.
KAREN
Quiet!
WILLIE
Pimples! Yay!
KAREN
Shush.

(to Charlie)
I’m sorry, the School gave me your
name but I’ve forgotten it.

CHARLIE
Charlie. Charlie Simms.

KAREN
How are you, Charlie?

CHARLIE
Fine, thanks.

KAREN
Right this way...

Charlie follows Karen as she picks her way down a dark hall
littered with toys and a stroller, past an adult work bench,
through a kitchen in deep activity with pots working on the
stove.

KAREN (contd)
You’re available for the whole
weekend?

CHARLIE
Yes.
KAREN
Not going home for Thanksgiving?

CHARLIE
No. *

KAREN
Good.

She opens the back door, tired wooden steps lead down to a yard.
 

KAREN (contd)
-- They put him in a Veterans’ Home
but he hated it. I told my dad we’d
take him --

EXT. REAR, ROSSI HOUSE - DAY

Karen leads Charlie across the yard towards a small dark
cottage, an unexpected outcropping in this cramped yard.

KAREN
-- Before you go in, do you mind my
telling you a few things? Don’t ‘sir’
him, don’t light his cigars, and if
he staggers a little when he stands
up, don’t pay any attention.

Charlie stops now, stares at the cottage’s dark windows. Karen
smiles, trying to displace Charlie’s sudden caution.

KAREN (contd)
Charlie, I can tell right away you’re
the right person for the job. And
Uncle Frank’s going to like you, too.

CHARLIE
Where are you going to be this
weekend?

KAREN

We’re driving to Albany. Donny -- my
husband -- he’s got family there.

Karen reaches down for a cat who bounds out of a pet door at the
bottom of the cottage’s entrance, she knocks, then calls inside.

KAREN (contd)
Do you want Tommy in or out?!

The briefest of silences, then a powerful VOICE:

COLONEL SLADE (V.0.)
LEAVE HIM OUT!

Charlie flinches.

COLONEL SLADE (V.0.) (contd)
He’s chasing that calico ginch from
the tract houses!

Karen, gently tossing the cat out into the yard, senses
Charlie’s hesitation.

KAREN
(to Charlie)
Down deep, the man is a lump of sugar.
 

Karen gives Charlie a reassuring nod, and the gentlest of
pushes. He enters the cottage, the door closes quietly behind
him. Through the silence, Charlie hears the burblings of
children as Karen, heading back across the yard to her house, is.
joined by Francine and Willie.

FRANCINE (V.0.)
He’s going to hate hin.

WILLIE (V.0.)
Pimples!

INT. SLADE’S COTTAGE - DAY

Semi-darkness but as the eyes become accustomed, objects start
to come into view. Charlie taps on the door frame.

> CHARLIE
Sir?

SLADE (V.0.)
Don’t call me ‘sir!’

CHARLIE
Sorry, I mean, mister -- sir --

SLADE (V.0.)
What are you, a moron?

CHARLIE
No, mister, that is --

Charlie unfolds the squares of paper again, pores over it for
help, glances back at Karen’s house but she has disappeared
inside.

CHARLIE (contd)
Lieutenant, yes sir, Lieutenant -- ?

SLADE (V.0.)

Lieutenant Colonel! Twenty-six years
on the line, no one ever busted me
four grades before. Get in here, you
idiot

Charlie steps inside, through the crepuscular light the only
objects Charlie can discern are some cat food and a bowl of
water at the bottom of a bulging bookcase. Coming into view
now, a blanket on the wall stitched in black, gray and gold
which reads "U.S.M.A. 1965", team and military unit photographs,
a picture of the dismissed General MacArthur waving to the
crowds on 5th Avenue from the back of an open car.

Through the silence and darkness, a man becomes visible, planted
in an armchair in the midst of this dormitory room/Bachelor
Officers Quarters. His name is FRANK SLADE, LT. COLONEL (U.S.A.
ret.).
 

SLADE (contd)
Come closer, I want to get a better
look at you.

Charlie moves in closer and now, as Slade raises his head to
sniff the air, Charlie can make him out better.

Slade is blind, still the man cuts a remarkable figure. In his
late-forties, he wears a coat and tie, a pair of jodhpur boots,
his chin is chiselled, his posture erect, not an ounce of fat,
his neck swiveling slightly as he brings Charlie into his radar,
both eyes staring blankly, crow’s feet around the corners of
them which prove, on closer examination, to be scars.

SLADE (contd)
How is your skin?

CHARLIE
My skin, sir?

SLADE
For chrissake!

CHARLIE
-- I don’t know, Mister --

SLADE
‘Frank!’ Call me Frank! Or Mr.
Slade. Or if you must, Colonel!

Slade bangs the oversized silver oak leaf mounted on burnished
wood beside him, the plaque slashing into the table. He pinches
the end of a cigar, reaches for a Zippo lighter and begins the
hit-and-miss business of lighting it. Charlie unconsciously
aids him with body English until the flame makes contact, then
Slade reaches for a mean bottle of whiskey beside him, splashes
the whiskey into a glass with such a vengeance that some of the
dark liquid flies up onto his fingers, he waggles them at
Charlie and the drops flicker onto Charlie’s nose.

SLADE (contd)
Simms, Charles, a Senior. You on
Student Aid, Simms?

CHARLIE
Yes, I an.

SLADE
For ‘Student Aid’ read ‘crook.’ Your
father peddles car telephones at a
300% markup and your mother works on
heavy commission in a camera store. ~
(taps his ashes)
Graduated to it from espresso
machines.

Charlie is at a loss.
 

10.

SLADE (contd)
What are you, dying of some wasting
disease? .

CHARLIE
I’m right here, sir.

SLADE

I know exactly where your body is.
What I’m looking for 1s some
indication of a brain. Too much
football without your helmet?

(cackles)
Lyndon’s line on Jerry Ford. Deputy
Debriefer, Paris Peace Talks, ‘68.
Shave-tail, snagged a Silver Star,
threw me into G-2. How old are you?

CHARLIE
17.

Slade sniffs.

SLADE
Smells more like 18.
(smiles lasciviously)
Get down last night?

The cat pops back through the pet door, crosses to his food.
Slade senses him, fondly angles his head towards him.

SLADE (contd)
The old ass man didn’t quite get his
ashes hauled. You can tell when he
comes back hungry. Like a woman whose
brains you’ve just fucked out and she
asks you for a cigarette. Where you
from?

CHARLIE
Gresham, Oregon.

SLADE
So what does your father do in
Gresham, Oregon, count wood chips?

CHARLIE
My stepfather and my mom run a
convenience store.

SLADE -
7-Eleven, Arco, Allsup’s?

CHARLIE
It’s an independent.

SLADE
What time they open?

13.

DONNY
Hi, Charlie.

CHARLIE
Hello. I don’t know, Mrs. Rossi --
I got the feeling I screwed up.

KAREN
You couldn’t have.

CHARLIE
-- It was a bad interview.

KAREN
That was no interview, Charlie, you’re
it. You’re the only one who showed
up. And you've got to take the job.
He sleeps a lot, you can watch
television, call your girlfriend, I
promise you, an easy three hundred
bucks.

CHARLIE
I don’t get an ‘easy’ feeling.

KAREN
His bark is worse than his bite. The
man grows on you. By Sunday night,
you'll be best friends.

Charlie blinks.

KAREN (contd)
Charlie, please -- I want to get away
with my husband for a few days -- and
Uncle Frank won’t come with us. I
could practically leave him alone --
I just feel better having someone
around. Just in case. Please --

vu

Donny turns around now from the bathtub, looks pleadingly at
Charlie... Karen does, too. Together, they wait for his
decision. Finally, Charlie smiles reticently.

CHARLIE
Okay, Mrs. Rossi. Sure.

Karen smiles gratefully at Charlie, turns back to the bathtub,
Francine scoops some suds off her chest, throws them at Charlie
as he backs out.

EXT. ROSSI HOUSE - DUSK 11

Charlie exits, shoves his hands into his back pockets, regards
the whole, scruffy Rossi compound, now hurries off into the
twilight and The Baird School.
 

11.

CHARLIE
Five AM.

SLADE
Close?

CHARLIE
One AM.

SLADE

Hard workers, you got me all
misty-eyed. So, what are you doing
in this sparrow-fart town?

CHARLIE
I attend Baird.

SLADE
‘Attend’ Baird? I know you go to The
Baird School. The point is how do you
afford it, even with Student Aid plus
the folks back home hustling the Corn
Nuts?

CHARLIE
I won a National Merit Scholarship.

Silence.

SLADE
Hoo-rah.

There is a tapping at a window pane of the door which opens onto
the yard. Francine is there.

SLADE (contd)
Who’s that?!

Francine rattles her fingers on the glass, sticks her tongue
out, makes a crazy face at Charlie.

SLADE (contd)
Is that that little piece of tail?!
Get her out of here!

He hurls a rubber mouse at the door, it slams against the
window, falls to the floor, little bells ring gently. Slade
tilts his head in the direction of Karen’s house.

SLADE (contd)
I can’t believe they’re my blood. The -
IQ of sloths and the manners of
banshees. A mechanic and a homemaker.
He knows as much about cars as a
beauty queen and she bakes cookies
that taste like wing nuts. As for the
tots, they’re twits. Did you say you
had a skin condition, son? I like ny
aides to be presentable.
 

10

12.

Charlie feels his face.

CHARLIE
I had a few zits, sir.
(into himself)
My roommate lent me his Clinique...
he’s from Chestnut Hill and --

SLADE
‘The History of My Skin’ by Charles
Simms. Are you patronizing me,
Peewee? Giving me the old Prep School
palaver? The Baird School. A bunch
of runny-nosed snots in tweed jackets
studying to be George Bush.

CHARLIE ’
President Bush, I believe, went to
Andover.

SLADE

Don’t sharpshoot me, punk. You’1l
give me forty then you’ll give me
forty more, then you'll pull K.P. The
grease trap. I/’11 bury your nose in
Enlisted Man’s crud until you don’t
know which end is up! What do you
want?!

CHARLIE
A job, Colonel Slade. I’m trying to
make my plane fare home for Christmas.

Slade drains his drink, starts the dangerous ceremony of
lighting a fresh cigar, hits a button and country music PLAYS.
Charlie is in thrall.
After a few moments, Slade shuts the music off.
SLADE

Are you still hanging around,

Poormouth? Convenience store, my ass.

Hustling Jalapeno dips to the

Appleseeds. Dis-missed!
Charlie exits quickly, hurries across the yard to Karen’s house.
INT. KAREN’S HOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY 10

Karen is bathing Francine, washing up Willie is DONNY, her
husband, a blue-collar guy. .

CHARLIE
Mrs. Rossi -- ?

Karen eagerly turns around from the tub to Charlie.

KAREN
Charlie, this is Donny.

EXT. BAIRD SCHOOL - QUADRANGLE - NIGHT 12

The place quiet at night, a couple of lights burning in the
Administration Building, the library, and the science labs.

INT. DEAN TRASK’S OFFICE - NIGHT 13

Dean Trask is working overtime, signing letters as Mrs. Hunsaker
prepares them in her outer office.

INT. BAIRD LIBRARY - NIGHT 14

Charlie is stamping out the books of the last student before
closing. The student is George. Charlie pauses over one of the
books.

CHARLIE
This can’t go out, it’s on Reserve.

GEORGE
Here’s the thing. I need it for
tonight. Thanksgiving quiz with Big
Shit Preston in the morning.

CHARLIE
That’s why he put it on Reserve. We
only got one copy.

GEORGE
So I’ll heave it through the slot in
the A.M. Chas, I got to do an all
night, all frantic. Without this
book, I’m dead.

Charlie studies George.

CHARLIE
If it’s not back by 7:30, it’s my
ass --
GEORGE
I promise.
Charlie shrugs, smiles.
CHARLIE

Okay. Sure.

George grabs the book, Charlie reaches for a window pole by the
desk.

GEORGE ~
You headed back, I/’11 wait for you.

CHARLIE
Give me a minute.

Charlie closes the top of one of the great windows with a pole,
starts pulling down shades to half-mast. George stands by,
doesn’t help.

EXT. DEAN TRASK’S HOUSE - NIGHT

The Dean’s maroon Jaguar is parked outside. Harry approaches
it stealthily, bends over the trunk, pops it open with a
crowbar. Nearby, a concrete mixer from a small landscaping
operation has been resting overnight beside a garden wall.
Jimmy jabs a bag of concrete mix with a spade, Trent picks up
the bag and heaves the contents into the mixer. Harry switches
the mixer on, it THUMPS rhythmically. He picks up the nozzle
of the mixer’s thick hose and jogs back to the car with it, as
the first drops of concrete squeeze out.

INT. BAIRD LIBRARY - NIGHT

Charlie and George bounce down the marble steps leading to the
lobby of the building.

INT. DEAN TRASK’S OFFICE - NIGHT

Mrs. Hunsaker, all bundled up against the November chill, waves
good night to Dean Trask as he finishes signing the day’s
correspondence.

EXT. DEAN’S HOUSE - NIGHT

The trunk of Dean Trask’s Jaguar is open, the concrete mixer is
churning, concrete pumping into the hose, Harry shooting the
high-pressure stream into the trunk of the car.

EXT. LIBRARY ~- NIGHT

Charlie and George emerge.

CHARLIE
..-Hold on, got to get the door.

George waits as Charlie locks up, turns out the last indoor
light, sets an outdoor light.

EXT. THE BAIRD SCHOOL - NIGHT

Mrs. Hunsaker walks placidly across the silent quadrangle. But
now her eyebrows knit at the SOUND of the concrete mixer.

EXT. THE BAIRD SCHOOL - CHAPEL - NIGHT

" George and Charlie heading along a path to the dormitories.

GEORGE
..-God, can you wait to get out of .
this dump?
CHARLIE
Where you going skiing again? Sugar
Loaf?

George laughs, but now the SOUND of the concrete mixer gets his
attention. He and Charlie glance down towards the Dean’s house,
see Harry, Trent and Jimmy busy around the concrete mixer.

EXT. DEAN’S HOUSE - NIGHT “22

Something makes the busy Harry look up, he sees the figure of
Mrs. Hunsaker approaching. Harry drops the hose, Jimmy slams
the car trunk, Trent switches off the mixer and the three of
them take off. Sudden silence.

From a distance, George and Charlie are observing the scene,
when Mrs. Hunsaker appears behind them.

MRS. HUNSAKER
Who was that?

George looks at Charlie, Charlie looks at George.

MRS. HUNSAKER (contd)
Who were those boys? What were they
doing?

GEORGE
I don’t know, ma’am.

MRS. HUNSAKER
Charles?

CHARLIE
Ummm --

Mrs. Hunsaker now scrutinizes the exterior of the Dean’s house,
put all is absolutely quiet. The silence is interrupted by a
1970 Plymouth Valiant, in mint condition, pulling up at the curb
at the end of the quadrangle path.

GEORGE
Isn’t that your husband, Mrs.
Hunsaker?

Mrs. Hunsaker glances at her watch, checks around again but all
is still and she crosses the "yard" to her car.

EXT. DEAN TRASK’S HOUSE - NEXT MORNING 23

Trask heads out into the brisk morning air, his pipe at a jaunty
angle, is about to climb into his Jaguar, glances down, notices
it has a flat rear tire. He sighs, opens the door on the driver
side, reaches in to pop the trunk release, then walks around to
the back to get out the jack. But the trunk is filled with _
solid concrete and now with a CRACK, the other rear tire gives
way and the entire car tilts skywards as it settles back on

its rear axles.

A hysterical, contemptuous ROAR from the hill overlooking the
Dean’s house, Trask looks up, half the student body has
assembled to observe him.

17.

INT. DINING HALL - MORNING 24

Piled high outside the door is weekend luggage, laundry bags,

backpacks, hockey sticks taped to overnight valises. In the

growded dining hall, Harry chats casually with George, Trent and
immy.

GEORGE
..-It’s the timing that I love. The
morning of Thanksgiving weekend. What
the hell’s he going to do now -~-

HARRY
(to George)
..-You didn’t hear anything, you
didn’t see anything.

GEORGE
- And dammit, I didn’t get to do
anything.
HARRY

You were too busy grinding for
Preston’s quiz. If you’re not
careful, George, you’re going to end
up an Achiever.

GEORGE
I almost shat when the old bag --

HARRY
She doesn’t know a thing.

Trent motions to Harry. They all fall silent as Charlie darts
through the dining hall doors just before they close, takes the
Closest seat available -- at Harry’s table.

HARRY (contd)
What about you, Oregon?

CHARLIE
Huh?

HARRY
Did you see anything?

Charlie glances casually at Harry, now at George, he is very
aware of what is in the air. He reaches down the table for a
serving bowl swimming with poached eggs.
GEORGE -
You get a Dean’s slip, Chas?

George and Harry are studying Charlie, he chooses not to respond
to George, but his eyes are on Harry as he answers.

CHARLIE
Yeah, I got one.
 

25

18.

Charlie dips into the bowl, Harry stares with a mixture of
wonder and contempt as Charlie slides a pair of watery eggs onto
a cold piece of toast.

INT. DEAN TRASK’S OFFICE - MORNING "25

Dean Trask is at his window, looking down at the "yard" and the
maelstrom of students streaming out for the Thanksgiving holiday
as vans, buses and a few fancy private cars await them in the
street.

Trask turns back from the window to George and Charlie who are.
seated in chairs in front of his desk. He closes his door.

TRASK
Mr. Simms -- Mr. Willis --

Charlie comes to semi-attention in his chair, but George is very
relaxed.

TRASK (contd)
Mrs. Hunsaker says both of you
gentlemen were at a vantage point last
night to observe who was responsible
for this -- ah -- stunt.

Silence.

TRASK (contd)
Who was it?

GEORGE
I really couldn’t tell you, sir. I
thought it was weird the mixer was
working at night but by the time I
pulled focus, they were gone.

TRASK

Mr. Simms?
CHARLIE

I couldn’t say for sure.
TRASK

Okay, for not sure?

CHARLIE
Uh -- I don’t know -- uh...

Dean Trask surveys Charlie and George, he takes his time before
he resumes.
TRASK
That automobile is not just a
possession of mine. That automobile
was presented to me by the Board of
Trustees.
(MORE)
 

A cold smile

19.

TRASK (contd)
It is a symbol of the standard of
excellence for which this school is
known. And I will not have it
tarnished.

GEORGE
The automobile?

from Trask.

TRASK
The standard, Mr. Willis.

He glances from George to Charlie.

TRASK (contd)
What is your position, Mr. Simms?

CHARLIE
On what, sir?

TRASK
on preserving the reputation of Baird?

CHARLIE
I’m for Baird.

TRASK
Then who did it?

CHARLIE
I couldn’t say for sure.

TRASK
Do you know what a Class B felony is,
Mr. Willis?

George shakes his head "no."

No response.

TRASK (contd)
Mr. Simms?

CHARLIE
No, sir.

TRASK
It’s a crime punishable by up to seven
years in the State Penitentiary in
Concord. Ever visited our prison in ~
Concord?
 

Silence.

He waits for
silent.

20.

TRASK (contd)

It is not a pleasant place. That is
where I am sending the instigators of
this event and, unless you tell me
fully and completely what happened,
I’m going to see to it you end up
there as well on whatever charges I
can muster for not reporting the
commission of the crime. Do I make
myself clear?

GEORGE
Yes, sir.
CHARLIE
Yes, sir.
TRASK
Then what have you gentlemen got to
say?

TRASK (contd)
very well. First thing Monday
morning, when we're all over our big
Thanksgiving weekend, I’m convening
a special session of the
Student-Faculty Disciplinary
Committee. As this is a matter which
concerns the whole school, the entire
student body will be present. There
will be no classes, no activities,
nothing will transpire at this
institution until that proceeding is
concluded. And if at that time we are
no further along than we are now, I
will expel you both and turn this
matter over to Andrew Runkle, the
Attorney General of this state. We
were in the same class at Dartmouth.
Andy is a very good friend of mine.

Charlie and George to speak, but they remain
TRASK (contd)
Mr. Willis, would you excuse us?

GEORGE
Pardon, sir?

TRASK
Wait outside with Mrs. Hunsaker.

George nods anxiously, hurries out. Trask, silent for a moment,
regards Charlie.
 

21.

TRASK (contd)
One of the few perks of this office
is that I am empowered to handle
certain matters on my own, as I see
fit. Do you understand?

CHARLIE
Yes, sir.

TRASK
Good. The Dean of Admissions at
Harvard and I have an arrangement.
Along with the usual sheaf of
applicants submitted by Baird of which
virtually two thirds are guaranteed
admittance, I add one name, somebody
who is a standout and yet
underprivileged. A student who cannot
afford to pay the board and tuition
in Cambridge. Do you know on whose
behalf I’d drafted a memo this year?

CHARLIE
No, sir.

TRASK
You. You, Mr. Simms.

After a moment.

TRASK (contd)
Now can you tell me who did it?

After another moment.

CHARLIE
No, sir, I can’t.

TRASK
You are aware of what’s at stake,
aren’t you?

CHARLIE
Harvard or jail.

Trask studies him.
TRASK
Take the weekend to think about it,
Mr. Simms. Good morning.
Charlie gets up and goes.
26 EXT. ADMINISTRATION BUILDING - DAY 26

George hurries down the steps with a shaken Charlie, and out of
the Administration Building.
 

22.

GEORGE
What’d he say?

CHARLIE
Nothing.

GEORGE

What do you mean, ‘nothing’?

CHARLIE
The same thing he said to both of us,
he just said it over to me.

GEORGE
He’s good-cop, bad-copping us. He
knows I’m Old Guard, you’re fringe.
He’s going to bear down on me, soft
soap you. Did he try to soft soap
you?

CHARLIE
Uhh -- no.

GEORGE
I’m getting a slight panic pulse from
you, Charlie. Are you panicking?

CHARLIE
A little.
GEORGE
You're on scholarship, right?
CHARLIE
Yeah.
GEORGE

on scholarship from Oregon at Baird.
You’re a long way from home, Chas.

CHARLIE .
What’s that got to do with anything?

GEORGE
Well, I don’t know how they do it out
there but this is how we do it here.
We stick together. It’s us against
them, no matter what. We don’t tell
our parents and we don’t cover our
ass. Stonewall everybody and above ~
all never, never, leave any of us
twisting in the wind.

CHARLIE
What’s that got to do with my being
on scholarship?

 

GEORGE
Just trying to bring you up to speed.
 

27

23.

CHARLIE
Thanks.

GEORGE
Tell you what. Give me a few hours
to figure out the moves. Call me
tonight in Vermont. We’ll be at the
Sugarbush Lodge.

CHARLIE
All right.

GEORGE
You okay?

CHARLIE

Yeah, I guess so.

Charlie eases away, heads for one of the classroom buildings.
George keeps an eye on him until he disappears.

INT. ROSSI HOUSE - WATER STREET - AFTERNOON 27

Chaos as Karen and Donny and the children get ready to depart,
K-Mart luggage and shopping bags, the kids running sprints in
the kitchen on their tricycles as Donny tries to bundle them up
while Karen gives Charlie last-minute instructions.

KAREN
-- Try to keep him down to four drinks
a day.

DONNY

If you can keep him down to forty,
you’re doing good.

KAREN
We try to water them down a little.
Do you know how to do that -~ ?

DONNY
(remonstrating)
Honey --

KAREN
Okay, okay. All his food is in the
freezer. Vegetable soup, a nice fish
casserole. There’s more than enough
for both of you -- he’s not much of
an eater.

DONNY .
It’s a long drive, honey --
KAREN
Get the kids ready, I’11 be right out.

Donny squeezes Charlie’s shoulder, gives him a smile of
reassurance, goes to get the kids’ coats.
 

28

24.

FRANCINE
Mommy, Mommy, don’t forget Uncle
Frank’s walk --

WILLIE
Yay, yay, his walk -- !

Francine and Willie ditch their trikes and launch into their
version of a drunk -- Ben Blue/W.C. Fields/Foster Brooks rolled
into one, as rendered by two toddlers.

KAREN
Oh yeah, you got to air him out a
little every day.

Charlie observes the kids’ performance anxiously.

KAREN (contd)
Why don’t you go back there and get
oriented? I/’11 be out in a minute and
give you telephone numbers and stuff.

She turns back to button up the children, and Donny gathers
their belongings as Charlie heads across the backyard to the
cottage.

INT. SLADE’S COTTAGE - AFTERNOON 28

The SOUND of Slade on the telephone as Charlie enters. Charlie
glances around, the place is in transition, drawers open,
various clothing items slung over chairs. Near a small
refrigerator in an alcove, a huge mound of cat food and a large
bowl of water.

Charlie pokes his head in the bedroom. Slade, aware of Charlie
immediately, waves him inside.

SLADE
(into phone)
Is that you, Beautiful?...Yeah, we
spoke yesterday. Did you have a glass
of wine with lunch, you sound a little
dusky?
(chuckles dirtily)

Charlie clears his throat politely.

SLADE (contd)
(irritated)
Just a minute, Sweetheart... .
(to Charlie)
My dress blues, get them out, they’re
in a garment bag in the closet. Check
the top dresser drawer, take out the
shoulder boards and affix them
shoulders right and left ASAP.
25.

Slade carries the phone into the sitting room as a bewildered
Charlie crosses into the bedroom.

SLADE (contd)

(phone)
You know I’m not the kind of guy that
likes to rush things but I am catching
a 4 o’clock at Logan and I’m looking
out my window and there’s no taxi in
sight...Has Chet invested in a radio
yet?...Well, get your driver on it and
tell him to get a move on...

(a seductive whisper)
Some kind of body must go with that
bedroom voice. One day I’m going to
swing by and get a look at it.

Charlie looks around the bedroom, the bed is stripped
military-style, a pillow without a case rests on a blanket at
the foot of a sheetless mattress. Charlie blinks at the bed,
the sudden WHACK of a cane against the door jamb.

SLADE (contd)
My Val-Pak’s underneath, put the
boards on the blues and fold them in.

CHARLIE
We going someplace?

i ) SLADE
What business is it of yours?

Charlie shrugs innocently.

SLADE (contd)
Don’t shrug, you imbecile. I’m blind.
Save your body language for the bimbi.
Now get out my gear!

Slade sniffs the air.

SLADE (contd)
What time is it, it’s got to be about
three and the goddamn Flintstones
haven’t left yet.

Charlie glances out the window.

CHARLIE
Here comes Mrs. Rossi now.

Slade reaches out and grabs Charlie.

SLADE
I said good-bye to her twice, what has
she got, separation anxiety? Cut her
off at the door! :

 
 

29

30

26.

He pushes Charlie towards the door, keeping a hand on him to
stay oriented. Karen knocks gently, Charlie opens it. Slade
calls to her over Charlie’s shoulder.

SLADE (contd)
Hi, honey! ‘Bye, honey!

Karen reaches out, hands Charlie a folded piece of paper,
provoking a wary Slade to crowd into the doorway.

KAREN
(to Charlie)
This is where we’ll be --

In her rush, Karen takes a moment now. Purposefully, she leans
up to kiss Slade and he, in return, searches her face with his
hand. Charlie watches, entranced by the movement of Slade’s

head which swivels like a performing seal as he scans Karen’s
presence.

KAREN (contd)
I wish you were coming with us.

SLADE
Thanks. Maybe next time.

Now Karen hurries away, Slade ducking back in the house as a
slightly forlorn Charlie remains in the doorway watching her
go.

EXT. REAR, ROSSI HOUSE - DAY 29
Karen strides quickly across the yard towards the car, where
Donny and the children are waiting.
KAREN
Good luck, Charlie. Don’t let him
drink too much!
She climbs in the car, leans out the window.
KAREN (contd)

And no 900 numbers! He loves to talk
dirty!

_ The Rossis and their children drive away. Through the rear

window a disappearing Francine reprises her staggering drunk
routine for Charlie.

SLADE (V.0.)
Get to work!

INT. SLADE’S COTTAGE - DAY 30

Charlie hurries back inside, Slade is struggling with a piece
of luggage under his bed, Charlie bends to help him, pulls out
a military bag, it is real pro, all polished leather and khaki.
Slade straightens up and busies himself attending to his clothes
as, behind him, the straps on the bag confound Charlie.
 

27.

SLADE
What is it, the L-Buckles? Never in
the Boy Scouts, sluggo?

CHARLIE
Made tenderfoot.

SLADE
Tenderfoot, my foot! A convenience
store Mama’s boy! Give it to me.

In order to guide Slade back to the bag on the bed, Charlie
takes Slade’s arm, but Slade slaps Charlie’s hand away
violently.

SLADE (contd)
Touch me again and I’11 kill you, you
little son-of-a-bitch.

Charlie does a "hands off!" as if he’d touched a burning
skillet.

SLADE (contd)
I touch you! Now go get my
shoulder-boards.

A chastened Charlie slides the bag over to Slade, in an instant
Slade has unfastened the buckles as Charlie reaches into the top
of the Colonel’s bureau; medals, ribbons, a ceremonial dagger, a
trove of military honors in dusty disarray.

SLADE (contd)
The epaulets with the silver oak leaf!

Charlie locates the Lt. Colonel insignia, lifts the garment bag
out of the closet, Slade zips it open, affixes the shoulder
boards, expertly folds the dress uniform into the Val-Pak, zips
it shut.

SLADE (contd)
We're all set.

CHARLIE
For what?
SLADE
See if the cab is here.
CHARLIE
Where are we going?
SLADE

Freak Show Central.

CHARLIE
Where’s that?

SLADE
New York City.
 

28.

Charlie blinks.

SLADE (contd)
That’s located in New York State, son.

_ CHARLIE
Mrs. Rossi didn’t say anything about
going anywhere.

SLADE
She forgot.

Charlie measures hin.

CHARLIE
Well -- maybe we should wait and call
her. She gave me her number --

SLADE
They just hit the road. Between piss
calls for those kids and that
Hupmobile he drives, by the time they
get to Albany it/’1l be opening day at

Saratoga.
CHARLIE

I can’t go to New York.
SLADE

Why not?
CHARLIE

It’s too much responsibility.
SLADE

No, it isn’t. I had a lot of
seventeen year olds in my first
platoon.

Slade reaches into his rear trouser pocket.

SLADE (contd)
Tickets --
(right trouser
pocket)
Money --
(inside suit coat
pocket)
Speech.

He smiles devilishly at Charlie. ~

SLADE (contd)

An old Washington joke.
(runs his tongue over
his teeth)

From my days with Lyndon.

The HONK of a horn.
 

29.

SLADE (contd)
I knew I could count on
Transportation. Are you ready?

Charlie, fighting for time, remains silent.
SLADE (contd)

Hello! This is not Panmunjom, a
simple ‘yes’ will do.

CHARLIE
Umm --

SLADE
That’s what I like to hear! Get my
bag.

Slade crouches and Tommy, the cat, leaps into his arms.

SLADE (contd)
(nuzzling the cat)
When in doubt, Tomster, fuck.

The horn HONKS again, he dumps Tommy, reaches for Charlie’s arm
and they head out.

SLADE (contd)
Don't rush. They always hold the
plane for field grade officers.

31 EXT. LOGAN AIRPORT - BOSTON - AFTERNOON 32

A taxi pulls up to the curb, its door flies open and a cane
probes the air as curbside, a SKYCAP hustles to greet the
arriving passengers. Charlie, emerging from the other door,
hurries around to the trunk for the bag as Slade hands the
Skycap the tickets.

SKYCAP
Yes sir, two for the shuttle to New
York --

SLADE

We’re not shuttling anywhere, we’re
riding First Class!

The Skycap checks the tickets.
SKYCAP
Yes sir, Mr. Simms and Colonel Slade. "
First Class.
As the Skycap takes the bag, Charlie turns to Slade.
CHARLIE

You bought a ticket for me? What made
you think I’d go to New York?
 

30.

SLADE
Are you some chicken-shit who sticks
to the job description?

The Skycap staples a baggage check to the tickets. Charlie

reaches for them but Slade bashes his hand away, takes them

himself. Slade extends a ten-spot to the Skycap who happily
accepts it.

SLADE (contd)
(to the Skycap)
As you were, Sarge --

The Skycap salutes as Slade strides off holding his arm out,
Charlie running to catch up to it.

SLADE (contd)
Are you blind?

CHARLIE
Of course not --

SLADE
Then what are you taking my goddamn
arm for, I take your arn.

CHARLIE
Sorry --

SLADE
Don’t be sorry, how would you know?
You’ve been watching MTV all your
life.

CHARLIE
Colonel, I can’t go to New York, hey
look, I’m --

SLADE
Don’t ‘hey, look’ me! This is New
York we’re talking about. This is an
opportunity, squirt. Now listen up.
There are two kinds of people in this
world. Working Stiffs who stick to
the lesson plan, and Wild Talents who
go for the brass ring. Which are you
going to be?

Before Charlie can answer --

SLADE (contd) .
Never mind, I‘’1l take care of you.

Slade takes Charlie by the arm, squeezes his bicep, Charlie
grimaces.
 

 

32

 

31.

SLADE (contd)
Two oysters wrapped in rags.
(to Charlie)
Half step ahead. Guide on, soldier.

Charlie leads the way, the Colonel striding on, swinging his
cane as he goes, his head tilted at a sharp angle that seems to
slash through the outside world.

SLADE (contd)
And stay on the right side, there are
women on the left.

They switch sides, a salacious smile on the Colonel’s lips as he
aims his nose at every female passerby.

INT. BOSTON - NEW YORK 737 - AFTERNOON 32

An uncrowded plane, Slade’s seat is on the aisle, he tunes his
radar to the approach of a shapely Flight Attendant.

FLIGHT ATTENDANT
Can I get you gentlemen anything to
drink?

SLADE
Triple Jack Daniels, water back.

Charlie winces, makes a narrow gesture to the Flight Attendant
with his thumb and forefinger, "water it." She nods
conspiratorially.

FLIGHT ATTENDANT
(to Charlie)
And for you, sir?

CHARLIE
Nothing.

SLADE
It’s First Class, Peewee, it comes
with the fare.

CHARLIE
No, thanks.

SLADE
What are you, a Temperance Union?

CHARLIE
I don’t want anything --

SLADE
(to Flight Attendant)
To complete the order, Daphne, give
Andy Hardy here a Diet Slice, water
back.

The Flight Attendant moves off.
 

32.

CHARLIE
How did you know her name?

SLADE

She’s wearing Floris. That’s English.
But her voice is pure California
chickie. California chickie bucking
for English lady. So I call her
Daphne.

(pokes an elbow)
Big things may happen to that little
thing of yours.

CHARLIE
Look, Colonel, 1/11 get you to New
York but then I’m going to have to
turn right around and come back.

SLADE
Of course you will.

The Flight Attendant returns with Slade’s drink, hurries away.
He takes a sip, makes a face.

SLADE (contd)
Who’s mixing the drinks here, The
Flintstones?

: He swallows a big gulp anyway.

SLADE (contd)
Try that again, you’re getting out at
Hartford.

CHARLIE
The flight is non-stop.

SLADE
You'll get out at Hartford anyway.

CHARLIE
Wish I could. I don’t belong on this
plane. I don’t belong in New York.

SLADE
Don’t worry about ‘pelonging,’ sonny,
there’s only one club to belong to.
That’s your own. Make your own rules,
be your own Board of Governors. Pay
your own dues. .
Slade drains his drink, reaches into his vest pocket for a
flask, splashes more dark liquid over the watery rocks, filling
it to the edge. Charlie watches in horror.

CHARLIE
Why are we going to New York?
 

Slade sighs.

33.

SLADE
All information will be given on a
need-to-know basis.
(craning his head)
Where’s Daphne? Let’s get her down
ere.

CHARLIE
She’s way in the back.

SLADE
The tail’s in the tail.

He sniffs again.

SLADE (contd)
I can still smell her. Women. Who
made them? God was a fucking genius.
What a mind the guy must’ve had. The
hair -- they say the hair is
everything. Have you ever buried your
nose in a mountain of curls and just
wanted to go to sleep forever? And
lips that when they touch yours are
that first swallow of wine after
you’ve just crossed the desert?

Slade is deep into a reverie.

SLADE (contd)
Tits. Big ones, little ones, bury
your face in them and nipples that
stare at you like secret searchlights.
Legs, I don’t care if they’re Greek
columns or second-hand Steinways,
between them is a passport to heaven.
Don’t think I can’t see women because
I can’t see women. I’m a Female
Traffic Controller, Charlie, I can
bring them in. With my nose, with my
ears. What is it about them? "What
do they want?" Who cares what they
want. They’re wonderful. Yes, Mr.
Simms, there are only two syllables
in this whole wide world worth hearing
-- Pussy!

Charlie, struck dumb by Slade’s passion, remains silent.

SLADE (contd)
Are you listening to me? I’m giving
you pearls here.

CHARLIE
I guess you really like women.
 

33

34

34.

SLADE
Above all things.

Slade refills his drink, there is no ice left, so he downs it
straight. A helpless Charlie can only watch.

SLADE (contd)
-- A very, very distant second isa
Ferrari.
(a moment)
This air jockey’s not bad. 450 knots,
about 10,000 feet.

CHARLIE
How do you know?

SLADE
Charles, this is just the start of
your education.

EXT. WALDORF-ASTORIA HOTEL - NIGHT 33

A taxi pulls into the line of unloading limos, unloading taxis,
the main entrance redolent with the hustle and bustle of
well-coiffed women and sharp men, expensive luggage waiting by
shiny-brass hydrants to be sent upstairs, a burly Doorman with
huge epaulets and rows of gold buttons, blowing the hell out of
a silver whistle.

Charlie is seated in the taxi next to the Colonel. Peering out
the window at the swanky sights, Charlie seems overcome. The
Doorman swings their door open.

CHARLIE
(to Slade)
Where are we?

SLADE
(Nirvana) ;
The Waldorf-Astoria.
INT. WALDORF LOBBY - NIGHT 34

Slade and Charlie follow JAIME, their bellman, up the steps
and into the giant lobby, floor-to-ceiling murals, chamber

. music issuing from public rooms.

SLADE
...It’s the last of the great lobbies.
Relax in an easy chair, smoke a
Havana. Watch the women go by and
when you’ve found the right one, an
urn of sand to douse your cigar.

Jaime waits patiently until Charlie and Slade catch up.
 

35.

SLADE (contd)
...Last time I was here was with two
of Madame Nhu’s generals. Couldn’t
shoot an azimuth, but could they find
the coordinates for a hooker? Talk
about ass-men. Those little
vietnamese bandits were not lacking
for testosterone. No sir!

They arrive at the desk.

SLADE (contd)
Yes sir, my kind of inn.

JAIME
(to Clerk)
Colonel Slade and Mr. Simms.

CLERK
We have your reservation right here,
Colonel --

SLADE
(intimately)
Mr. Gilbert around -- or is he back
on days?

The Clerk is momentarily puzzled.

SLADE (contd)
(impatient)
You know, the honcho -- what have they
done, booted him upstairs?

CLERK
Oh yes...Mr. Gilbert. He’s not been
with us for a number of years.

Slade sniffs, Charlie remains all bewildered by the
surroundings.

CLERK (contd)
...We’ve got a nice junior executive
for you, Colonel.

SLADE
Delete the ‘junior.’

CLERK
very good, sir.

The Clerk gives a different set of keys to Jaime.
" SAIME
Right this way, gentlemen. 2203.
Beautiful corner suite.

Slade seems appeased, he makes an abrupt right turn.
 

35

36.

JAIME (contd)

(to Slade)
No sir, this way.
SLADE

The elevators are over here!
JAIME

I’m sorry, Colonel, the doors were
changed to the other side of the
shaft.

> SLADE
When?

JAIME
I think about five years ago.

Slade takes a deep intake of breath.

SLADE
They’re putting too much Lysol in the
heads.
(to Charlie)
Follow him.

Charlie follows Jaime, Slade on Charlie’s arm as they approach
the elevators.

SLADE (contd)
(to Charlie)
...First time I came here was with the
G-2 from Brussels. He had a Ferrari.
I had to hold the door every day for
the fucker, never even offered me a
ride...

INT. ELEVATOR - WALDORF - NIGHT 35

Slade and Charlie are side-by-side behind Jaime who presides

over the luggage. Behind them in a corner of the elevator, an
elderly Racquet Club-type in a Trilby hat.

SLADE
(to Jaime)
What’s your name?

JAIME
Jaime.

SLADE ~
Okay, Hyman, should I want some of --
an indefinable
gesture)
...this...I call for you? Or, who's
working the street, the doorman?

. JAIME
Sir -- sir, I --
 

36

37.

Jaime at a loss, turns to Charlie for help.

SLADE
Whose department is it, Hyman?

Jaime gestures helplessly to Charlie.

CHARLIE
(to Slade, gently)
Colonel, I think he’s trying to tell
you he doesn’t really know ~~

SLADE
Hey! Don’t translate for me! I know
how to talk to a man in uniform!

The sudden tension in the elevator subsides as Slade peers over
his shoulder at the man in the corner, smiles, turns back to
Jaime, knowingly.

SLADE (contd)
I’m with you, Hyman. Classified.
Later.

INT. WALDORF SUITE - NIGHT 36

Jaine waits discreetly as Slade riffles through a sheaf of
ills.

SLADE
Spread the word --

Slade hands Jaime a generous tip.

SLADE (contd)
And the intelligence will be
forthcoming?

> JAIME
Sir?

SLADE
on the escort scene!

JAIME
Uhh -- yes, sir. And welcome to the
Waldorf.

Jaime goes.

SLADE .
Puerto Ricans always made the best
infantrymen.

Slade taps his way around the room, orienting himself to the
area. He comes to a dead end against a wall, turns and stumbles
into the mini-bar. He discerns the shape of it with his cane.
 

Charlie opens
nearby.

38.
SLADE (contd)
Give me an inventory.
the mini-bar as Slade locates the telephone
SLADE (contd)

(phone)
Get me ‘21’.

Charlie squats by the mini-bar, searching through the contents.

SLADE (contd)
(phone)
Is Sheldon or Mac there?

While Slade waits, Charlie reports to him on the contents of the

mini-bar.

CHARLIE
Early Times, Jim Beam. Lots of little
bottles...
Slade makes a face.
SLADE

Quartermaster’s on the take again.
(into phone)
...This is Colonel Frank Slade, one
of your old regulars. Used to come
in with General Garbisch...
(smiles)

Well, that’s probably because he’s at

Arlington, six feet under. Now listen
up, I want a table for two, and I’m
talking the fireplace up front. 8:15.

He taps the phone cradle, disconnecting his phone call.

Slade hangs w|

SLADE (contd)
(to Charlie)
Clear them little bottles out. Call
Hyman when I get off, tell him I want
it wall-to-wall with John Daniels.

CHARLIE
You mean Jack Daniels?

SLADE
He may be Jack to you but when you
know him as well as I do -- .
(into phone)
Colonel Slade...get me a limo for 8
o’clock.

p, takes a swig from his flask, a deep, satisfied

intake of breath through his nose.
 

 

37

39.

SLADE (contd)
(to Charlie)
What are you drinking?

Charlie, to avoid an answer, keeps rearranging the contents of
the mini-bar. Impatient, Slade holds out his flask to Charlie.

CHARLIE
No thanks, I don’t use it.
SLADE
What’s useful about it?!
CHARLIE
I dunno. Hey look, Colonel, I gotta
go.
SLADE

Where’re you going?

CHARLIE
I have to get back to school, I got
some reai important stuff I got to
take care of.

SLADE
Very well. But I never let my aides
leave on an empty stomach. You’1ll
dine with me, and then my driver will
transport you to the airport for the
Boston shuttle departing at 2200
hours. Unpack my bag, I’m going to
christen the latrine.

Slade gets up, breaks into a little two-step as he heads for the
bathroon.

SLADE (contd)
...Feels like morning of the Notre
Dame game.
(sings)
‘Sons of Mars and Thunder
Rip that line asunder
Carry on to victory -- ’

He shuts the bathroom door. Charlie opens Slade’s bag, starts
to unpack for him.

INT. LIMO - NIGHT 37

Slade looks dazzling in an expensive suit. Charlie, still in
his rumpled sweater, slumped in the rear seat next to Slade,
seems a thousand miles away, Slade pushes a button, his window
rolls down, Slade turning his head this way and that.
 

40.

SLADE

New York, New York -- smells good.

(a moment)
What have we got, a red light?
Nothing like a red light on Park
Avenue. All those tits hurrying to
cross the street -- Paradise! What’s
the matter with you?

CHARLIE
With me?

SLADE
The car feels heavy, you know why?
Because you’ve got the fucking weight
of the world on your shoulders.

CHARLIE
I have a little problem at school -~

SLADE
Spit it out.

CHARLIE
No big deal. Where’re we going again?
Twenty-what?

SLADE
So it’s no big deal? Then why is it
‘real important stuff’?

CHARLIE
Why is what?

SLADE
The ‘little problem’. Been banging
the headmaster’s daughter?
Charlie, giving in to the interrogation, sighs.
CHARLIE
I’m in a little trouble --
SLADE
What kind of trouble?

CHARLIE
I saw some guys doing something -~

SLADE
Doing what? ~

Charlie falls silent.
SLADE (contd)

To tell or not to tell -- or it’s your
ass.
 

41.

CHARLIE
How did you know that?
SLADE
I didn’t run S-2 for nothing.
CHARLIE
‘8-22!
SLADE

Intelligence! Give me the details.
Charlie hesitates under Slade’s glare.

CHARLIE
Well, you see there’s this guy, Harry,

he’s this real rich kid and he kind
of runs things, and --

SLADE
Who else -- ?

CHARLIE
This other guy, George. He didn’t do
anything. But he and I saw Harry and
his guys do something.

SLADE

George a friend of yours?
CHARLIE

He’s not my friend but he’s okay.
SLADE

You trust him?
CHARLIE

Yeah. Well, I guess so.
SLADE

Is he on scholarship, too?
CHARLIE

No. Why?

Slade leans forward.

SLADE

What's your name, driver?
MANNY *

Manny, sir.
SLADE

Manny, do you know Hyman?

MANNY
Hyman?
42.

SLADE
Hyman, the baggage-smasher at the
Waldorf.

CHARLIE
(to Slade)
I think his name is Jaime.

SLADE
That’s him. Jaime.

. MANNY
Oh, Jaime Esperanza-Chavez?

SLADE
I dian’t ask for his lineage, I asked
whether you knew hin.

MANNY
Yes sir, I do.

SLADE
Jaime any good at getting escorts?

MANNY
I wouldn’t know.

SLADE
What would you know?

MANNY
About what?

SLADE
About you-know-what!

Manny, in troubled bewilderment, squints.

SLADE (contd)
Well -- ?

MANNY
Maybe I could manage something.

SLADE
You mean for a fee?
MANNY
Let me think about this, sir --

SLADE
I’m talking top-of-the-line.

Slade turns to Charlie.

 

SLADE (contd)
Okay, we got Harry, we got George.
And we got trouble. They’re rich,
you’re poor.

(MORE)
38

39

 

43.

SLADE (contd)
But you want to get rich. You want
to graduate from Baird and become
a rich bigshot. Like them, right?

CHARLIE
No, it’s not that way at all --

Manny pulls up to the curb.

MANNY
Here we are, ‘21’.

EXT. "21" - NIGHT 38

The "21" Doorman opens Slade’s door, Slade emerges followed by
Charlie.

SLADE
(to Charlie)
Lighten up. When we get into dinner,
I’11 tell you what to do. Meanwhile,
let go of it, for Christ’s sake...

INT. "21" - NIGHT 39
The MAITRE D’ leads Slade and Charlie into the dining room.

SLADE
Where are you taking us?

MAITRE D’
We have a nice table for you in our
new East Room.

Slade, his hand on Charlie’s arn, stops. The Maitre da’,
unaware, continues on.

SLADE .
(to Charlie)
-- By the fireplace.

Charlie heads for the fireplace, there is a vacant table nearby,
Slade feels the chairs, takes a seat as if he owned the place.

SLADE (contd)
This’1l do.

The Maitre d’ reappears.

MAITRE D’ *
This table is reserved, sir.

SLADE
I appreciate your holding it for us.
Menus, please, and a double Jack
Daniels on the rocks.
 

44.

A Cloakroom Attendant hands the resigned Maitre d’ an
all-purpose blazer.

MAITRE D’
(to Charlie)
Perhaps you'll be more comfortable in
this, sir.

He helps Charlie on with the jacket, the sleeves a bit long, the
shoulders too tight.

SLADE
(to Charlie)
You look great.

The Maitre d’ gives Slade and Charlie menus, tenderly folds down
the collar on Charlie’s blazer, and heads back to the front.

SLADE (contd)
(to Charlie)
‘21,’ a table by the fireplace, and

you got a brand new jacket -- Kid,
we're cooking. Now read me the Bill
of Fare.

Charlie opens the menu as Slade drinks in the atmosphere.

CHARLIE
‘21’ Burger with fries -- twenty-four
dollars --

SLADE

Where’s the booze, it’s flowing like
mud around here?

CHARLIE
Twenty-four-dollar hamburger. What’s
the story?

SLADE
What story?

CHARLIE .
Are you a rich miser or something?

SLADE
I’m just your average blind man.

CHARLIE
Yeah, average blind man. How are you
going to pay for all of this?

SLADE .
Crisp, clean dollars -- American. I
saved up my disability checks.
 

 

CHARLIE
For the twenty-four-dollar burger or
the chicken and mashed at twenty-nine?
And how much did you save? First
Class on the plane, the
Waldorf-Astoria Hotel --

SLADE
It’s all part of a plan, Charlie.

CHARLIE
Well, could you let me in on it?

SLADE
Why do you give a shit? You’re taking
the last shuttle out of La Guardia.

Slade suddenly jerks his wrist to his eyes as if he were

checking a watch.

SLADE (contd)
Oops, you got fifteen minutes. I
don’t think you can make it. Unless
‘21’ keeps a complimentary helicopter
on the roof.

Slade studies his "watch" again.

SLADE (contd)
Nope, you’re stuck here until
tomorrow.

CHARLIE
Wait a minute, you said the last
shuttle was 2200 hours. That’s 10
ofclock, right?

SLADE
Last I heard.

CHARLIE
It’s only 8:30.

Slade’s drink arrives, he takes a swallow.

SLADE
I lied. It leaves at 9.

CHARLIE
It leaves at 9?!

SLADE
Yes, it does.

A moment, Slade sensing Charlie’s anger.
SLADE (contd)

The truth is, Charlie, I need a guide
dog to help me execute my plan.

 
 

46.

CHARLIE
What plan?

Slade smiles. .

SLADE
You have a right to know. It’s not
really a plan, Charlie. More like a
tour. A little tour of pleasures.
Stay in a first-class hotel, eat an
agreeable meal, drink a nice glass of
wine, see my big brother -- there’s
nothing like family, you know -- and
then make love to a terrific woman.
After that --

CHARLIE
Yes?

SLADE
I’m going to lie down on my beautiful
bed at the Waldorf and blow my brains
out.

The Waiter appears.

WAITER
Can I tell you our specials?

SLADE
By all means.

Charlie is staring at Slade.

WAITER
Tonight we have Charred Venison with
Buckwheat Spaetzle and Green
Peppercorns. Grilled Veal Paillarde
with Tomato Tapenade and Roasted
Eggplant --

Slade’s head is pleasantly tilted at the Waiter, but Charlie is
riveted on Slade, trying to ascertain what he said.

WAITER (contd)
And if you would like our Crepes
Souffle for dessert, it would be a
good idea to order it now.

SLADE
Yes on the Souffle, give us half a
minute on the rest.

WAITER
very good, sir.

SLADE
That means, Alphonse, don’t go too
far.

 
47.

WAITER
(indicating next
table)
I/11 just pour some wine over here,

sir.
The Waiter moves away, Slade turns to Charlie conspiratorially.

SLADE
I’m leaning towards the Spaetzle.

Slade falls pleasantly silent, gazes around the room in his
blind way, Charlie can’t take his eyes off him.

CHARLIE
Colonel Slade?

SLADE
Yes?

CHARLIE

Did you say you were going to blow
your brains out?

SLADE
Did I say that?

The Waiter returns from the adjacent table.

WAITER
Have you decided, sir?

i SLADE

| (to Charlie)

| Going for the burger?

| (to the Waiter)

| Give him the ‘21’ Hamburger medium
rare, and I’1l take the Chicken Hash

i on a Waffle. Also, save us some bread
pudding.

WAITER
Yes sir, thank you.

Charlie doesn’t know which way to turn. He starts to say one
thing, ends up saying another.

CHARLIE
‘Chicken Hash on a Waffle?’

SLADE -
Twenty-four dollars. Delicious. And
only the insiders know about the bread
pudding. Big Ed always put away three
helpings.

! Slade reaches across the table, locates the bread tray.

 
 

40

48.

SLADE (contd)

Try one of these rolls. I used to
dream of these rolls when I was at
Fort Huachuca. The bread’s no good
west of the Colorado. The water’s too
alkaline.

CHARLIE
Colonel Slade, did I hear you right?
You said you were going to kill
yourself?

SLADE
No, I said I was going to blow my

brains out. Eat this roll, Charlie,
I buttered it for you.

CHARLIE
I don’t want a roll.

SLADE
Okay, have a radish. Where were we?
Oh yes, the agenda. We're also going
to need to buy you some clothes. Is
Rogers Peet still around? They cut
a helluva mess jacket.

Slade grabs a passing Waiter.

SLADE (contd)
Get me a double Jack Daniels on the
rocks.

WAITER
Yes sir, right away.

Charlie makes a gesture to the Waiter with his thumb and
forefinger, a "weak drink," the Waiter nods, hurries away.

SLADE
(to Charlie)
Please don’t do that.

Directly behind Slade, the Maitre d’ seats an elegant, young
couple. Slade drinks in the beautiful woman’s scent,
intoxicated by her presence, as a very sober Charlie tracks his

every move.

SLADE (contd)
What a marvelous place.

INT. WALDORF SUITE - NIGHT 40

Charlie stands by as Slade moves tentatively around the room
again, re-orienting himself with his cane, tapping objects, then
moving on. He slaps a couch, reaches underneath the pillows,

feels a handle.
 

41

49.

SLADE
Your billet’s here. In the morning,
the area will be returned to sitting
room mode no later than 0700 hours.

Charlie salutes, Slade flinches. An ominous silence.

SLADE (contd)
What was that?

CHARLIE
Nothing!

SLADE
Next time, snap it out, thumb to palm,
index through little digit aligned
smartly, sharp to the hairline and
own!

Slade lets Charlie stew through another anxious silence.

SLADE (contd)
Too many men far better than you have
executed that courtesy and if you know
what’s good for you, don’t try it
again...

Charlie holds himself very still.

SLADE (contd)
This bat’s got sharper radar than the
Nautilus. Don’t fuck with me,
Charlie.

Slade lifts his cane, taps his way into his bedroon.

SLADE (contd)
See that you get a good night’s sleep.

Slade closes his door, Charlie stares at it for a moment. He
sits down on the couch, he glances around the fancy hotel
sitting room; damask drapes, directoire chairs, a fake French
antique desk. An air of bewilderment in Charlie gives way to
resignation. He stands up, removes the cushions from the couch
and pulls out the bed.

INT. WALDORF SUITE - NEXT MORNING 41

Charlie awakens with a start. A room service cart rests along
the wall. Charlie finds Slade standing on a footstool in front
of a three-paneled mirror. A female tailor, SOFIA, 24, is
fitting him with a pair of trousers. Slade hears the rustle of
Charlie’s covers as he arises.

___ SLADE
Good morning.

___ CHARLIE
Good morning.
 

Sofia smiles
pulls on his
carefully.

50.

SLADE
This is Sofia, Charlie. Descended
from a long line of Florentine pants
makers, she is a magician with a
needle. Sofia’s working me up a
little gabardine number and I’ve
already picked you out a blazer and
flannels. Juice, coffee and assorted
goodies on the trolley. Why don’t you
get up and get yourself together.

brightly at Charlie. He gets up, in his underwear,
pants, pours some coffee in a cup, surveys Slade

CHARLIE
How’re you feeling today, Colonel?

SLADE
Super! You know Sofia here’s working
Thanksgiving because she is putting
herself through college. I told her
my friend, Charlie, here was also

headed for college.

The word "college" jolts Charlie wide awake, he crosses to
Slade’s bedroom.

SLADE (contd)
Where’re you going?

CHARLIE

To make a phone call.
SLADE

What's wrong with this phone?
CHARLIE

I don’t want to disturb you.
SLADE

You're not disturbing me. Make your

call.
CHARLIE

I’d like to be private...
SLADE

Stay out of my room, this is as
private as you’re going to get.

Charlie reluctantly sits down at the desk, dials the operator.

CHARLIE
(phone)
Vermont information, please.

At the mirror, Sofia is pinning Slade’s new trousers. He
smiles at her, she smiles back.
 

51.

SLADE
How I’d love to fit you sometime.

CHARLIE
(phone)
I don’t know exactly, it’s the
Sugarbush Lodge.

SLADE
Sugar --
(smiles)
Bush.

Charlie dials a number as Sofia continues to work on Slade.

CHARLIE
(phone)
George Willis, please.

GEORGE (V.0.)
Hello.

CHARLIE
Hi George, it’s Charlie.

GEORGE (V.0.)
Hey, how’re you doing, why didn’t you
call last night?

CHARLIE
I’m sorry, I didn’t get a chance
until --

GEORGE (V.0.)
(interrupting)
You okay? You sound funny.

CHARLIE
No, I’m fine.

GEORGE (V.0.)
Next year, you’ve got to come up with
us. White powder on a base of snow
bunnies.

Charlie doesn’t answer.

GEORGE (V.0.) (contd)
Are you there?

CHARLIE ~
Yeah, I’m here. You asked me to call
you about the moves -~

GEORGE (V.0.)
For now, the move is no move. Status

quo. Everything’s the way we left it.
 

52.

CHARLIE
How did we leave it?

After a moment.

GEORGE (V.0.)
See no evil, hear no evil, you know
what I mean, Chas?

CHARLIE
Yeah. See no evil, hear no evil.

GEORGE (V.O.)
Ease out, everything’s going to be all
right. You hear me?

CHARLIE
I hear you.

GEORGE (V.0.)
Okay, then. Walk like you talk.

The phone clicks off.

CHARLIE
“Bye.

Charlie stares at the phone. Sofia is busy measuring Slade’s
leg. Slade’s head tilts towards Charlie. .

SLADE
What’s George’s last name?
CHARLIE
Willis.
SLADE

George Willis. That makes his father
George Willis, Senior. Charlie, how
do you think Big George is going to
feel about Little George ‘seeing no
evil’ and ‘hearing no evil’?

CHARLIE
No one is telling their parents.
We're keeping it between us.

SLADE
Oh, you think George isn’t going to
talk to his father about this? Damn ~
decent of him. What does George’s
father do?

CHARLIE
I don’t know.
 

53.

SLADE
Well, I’11 tell you. When George
Willis, Sr. is not busy as a
million-dollar man for Aetna Casualty
or is it New England distributor for
the Chrysler Corporation -- he
concerns himself with George Willis,
Jr. That’s what he does.

CHARLIE
George isn’t going to talk to his
father.

SLADE
Of course not.

(to Sofia)

Oops --

SOFIA

*Scusi, Colonello.

SLADE
Prego, I love it when you hurt me.
(whispers, to
Charlie)
Is she -- ?

Slade makes a pumping motion with his fist towards Sofia.

CHARLIE
Ummm -- uhh --

SLADE
Okay, got it. Where was I? _Oh yeah,
Big George didn’t get to be President
of Massachusetts Gear and Electric for
nothing. He’ll wind Little George up
and Little George will sing like a
canary. Good-bye Harry, hello Ivy
League and if you’re hip, Kid, you’1l
hop to, too.

CHARLIE
I don’t know what you’re talking
about.

SLADE

Listen up, it don’t take no National

Merit Scholarship to figure this one

out. You had a little life, Charlie.

So you came to Baird to put yourself ~
in the market for a big one. If you

want to stay in the running, you’re

going to have to tell them what they

want to know.

CHARLIE
You think so?
 

54.

SLADE

If you don’t sing, Charlie, you’ll end
up Shelving biscuits ina convenience
store in the Oregon ‘burbs.

(to Sofia)
That’s enough, Compari, now run
something up for Charlie here pronto,
we've got a date for Thanksgiving.

A date? ° ve

SLADE
My brother’s place, W.R. Slade, White
Plains, New York. The Plains, of
course, are neither white nor plains,
nevertheless located in fashionable
Westchester County.

CHARLIE
I can’t go to your brother’s place.
I should be getting back to school.

SLADE
C’mon, Charlie, you’ve got to have
Thanksgiving Dinner somewhere. Eats
‘n treats. And I could use the
company.

This registers on Charlie.

CHARLIE
Does he know I’m coming?

SLADE
He doesn’t know I’m coming. But wait
till you see the look on his face when
I walk through the door.

Slade beams.

SLADE (contd)
He adores me.

Slade steps off the footstool, extends an open palm, Charlie
fits Slade’s cane into it. Slade motions Charlie on to the
footstool.

SLADE (contd)
There are two kinds of people in this ~
world, Charlie. Those who stand up
and face the music. And those who run
for cover.

He taps his way towards his bedroom.

SLADE (contd)
Cover is better.
 

55.

42 INT. LIMO - MANHATTAN - DAY 42

Manny driving, Slade and Charlie seated in the back, they look
great in their new clothes.

Slade picks up the intercom phone.
SLADE

(into phone)
Any progress on the ‘action’?

What ‘action’?

SLADE
What ‘action’ do you think I’m talking
about?

MANNY

Oh, that ‘action’. Yes sir, yes sir,
the action is progressing.

SLADE
(to Charlie)
What are you looking at?

Charlie is startled by Slade’s "antennae".

/ CHARLIE
‘ Your shoes.
SLADE
You like these shoes?
CHARLIE
Well --
SLADE
You know how much these shoes cost?
CHARLIE
No --
SLADE

Eleven hundred dollars. Lobb’s of
London. Six months. A shoe architect
measures your feet, carves the last
out of solid maple, then the
‘clicker’, he’s the hide man, cuts
eight pieces of leather exactly to
specifications, a ‘closer’ sews them, .
sixteen stitches to the inch, the
‘maker’ cuts heel and sole, and
finally the ‘polisher’, he gives them
that dull, expensive look. Eleven
hundred dollars, Charlie, and worth
every penny of it. Nineteen years,

} these babies.
 

56.

Charlie, staring at the shoes, whistles.

CHARLIE

They still seem brand new.
SLADE

I’m leaving them to you.
CHARLIE

What do you mean?

SLADE
You’re about my size. Next week when
I’m secured, drop by the house and
pick them up.

CHARLIE
What do you mean, ‘secured’?

SLADE
Dead. Tell Karen I said they were
yours.

CHARLIE

I don’t like it when you kid around
like this, Colonel.

SLADE
I couldn’t be more serious.

CHARLIE
Then I’m going to have to go back to
school.

SLADE
Good idea.

Manny honks, swerves past some pedestrians.

CHARLIE
Suicide, Colonel Slade, is a crime.

SLADE
That’s your opinion and, of course,
the conventional wisdom. Look at the
Eskimos, you know the squaws, check
right out when they get old.

CHARLIE
Who says?

SLADE
Squaws chew leather. Chew the skins
‘til they’re soft enough to sew them
into clothing with bones they’ve
whittled down. When those ladies’
teeth are too far gone to soften
leather, they take a walk.
 

43

57.

CHARLIE
‘Take a walk?’

SLADE
Out of the igloo. Into the tundra.
Goom-bye.

CHARLIE
I studied Eskimos in Anthropology.
That’s bullshit.

A moment.

SLADE
Yes, it is. But, Charlie, what should
the old bags do when they can’t pull
their weight? No one’s too eager to
tear a herring with them anymore.

Slade is smiling slyly. He crosses and uncrosses his shoes.
SLADE (contd)
I always liked a good pair of shoes.
When you’re making love to a beautiful
woman, who’s looking at you but your
shoes?
Charlie turns away, stares out the window moodily.

CHARLIE
..-There’s a Ferrari dealer.

Slade picks up the phone.

SLADE
(to Manny)
Pull over.
INT. FERRARI DEALERSHIP, PARK AVENUE - DAY 43

A salesman, FRED BISCO, looks up from his desk, through the
showroom window he sees Manny scurry around the limousine, hold
the door for Slade. Charlie leads Slade across the sidewalk to
the showroom, but the door is locked. Fred gets up, goes to the
door, unlocks it, holds it ajar.

FRED
We’re closed.

SLADE
Then what are you doing here?

FRED
It’s Thanksgiving. I was just
catching up on my paperwork while the
wife took the kids to the parade.

SLADE
Interested in selling a car or not?
 

58.

Fred looks at Manny standing at attention beside his shin:
limo, observes the neat cut of Slade’s suit and that of his
companion’s, Charlie. .
FRED
Come in.

He opens the door wide, and Charlie leads Slade inside, he is
getting practiced "orienting" him. Slade stops in front of a

gleaming, red Ferrari, hooks his cane over his elbow and feels
the shape of the car with his fingers.

SLADE
Testarossa...Mondial?
FRED
Testarossa.
SLADE
Did they get the horses up to 350?
FRED
380.
SLADE

(to Charlie)
The D.O.T. wouldn’t let them bring it
in, in '85.

Slade opens the door of the Ferrari, closes it, opens it again,
salutes some unseen figure, closes it.

FRED
(a whisper, to
Charlie)
Could you watch the cane?
SLADE
(to Fred)
What’s your name?
FRED
Fred.
SLADE
Fred what?
FRED
Fred Bisco.
SLADE

Fred, never mind the cane, you’re
looking at a live one here.

Fred watches in horror as Slade’s cane now comes close to the
glimmering finish of the Testarossa, he starts to reach out for
Slade but Charlie politely restrains Fred’s arm. Slade moves to
another car, runs his hands over it gently.
 

44

SLADE (contd)

348?
FRED
You got it.
SLADE
‘tb’ or ‘ts’? Feels like a ‘ts’.
FRED
On the money, sir.
SLADE
(chuckling)

On the money is right.

Slade caresses this car, touches the shape of the open roof,
feels the leather-embossed wheel through the window, he is full
of tender love for this machine. ~

SLADE (contd)
G-2 needed a big Testarossa for his
little dick. I prefer the open air,
the flowing coed hair, of the ‘ts’.
(to Fred)
Where are these located now, one
hundred and a quarter?

FRED
For you sir, a hundred thirteen eight.

SLADE
Is that list?

FRED
Yes, sir.

SLADE

Then why is it for me?
Fred can’t answer.

SLADE (contd)
It’s your list, not mine. Shame on
you, Freddie Bisco.

Slade reaches for Charlie’s arm, they turn to walk out.

SLADE (contd)
(to Fred)
I/1l compare prices with your

colleagues in Jersey and Connecticut
and who knows -- we could be back.

EXT. HOUSE, WHITE PLAINS, WESTCHESTER COUNTY - DAY 44
The limo pulls up to an upscale house in a development,

fieldstone ground floors with white frame second stories. Manny
hurries around to the rear door, holds it open, helps Slade out.
 

60.

Charlie steps out behind Slade, takes his arm, leads him up to
the house. Manny settles back into the limousine as Charlie
rings the bell.

Curtains part at a window. At the window is RANDY, early 30’s,

Slade’s nephew, he looks out with pained surprise, the curtains

gyose. Randy opens the door, he surveys Slade, Charlie propping
im up.

RANDY
Yes?

SLADE
Who’s that?

RANDY
Randy.

SLADE

‘Randy.’ You new?
Randy looks from Charlie to Slade and back again.

RANDY
I’m your nephew.

SLADE
Oh yes, Randy. Here we are. Your
sister’s been hoarding me long enough.
Time to spread the riches around.

Randy calls into the house:

RANDY
Dad --

But before Randy gets a response, GAIL, 27, his attractive wife,
appears.

GAIL
Uncle Frank!

SLADE

(to Gail)

Gloria --

GAIL
Gail --

SLADE

Of course. Say hello to the potluck *
party from New York. Your Uncle Frank
and this is Charlie Simms, star
halfback on The Baird School football
team. They not only beat Exeter and
Groton, Aquinas High School, too.

SLADE (contd)
(to Randy)
Where’s your miserable father, no,
let’s surprise him. See if we can
give that fat heart of his an attack.
(calling out)
Willie!

INT. W.R. SLADES’S HOUSE - DAY 45

In the living room, two men are watching the NFL game on
television, W.R., mid-50’s, a messy overweight sort in a rumpled
3-piece suit, with him his younger son, GARRY, 25.

W.R.
Do you hear what I hear?

GARRY
I hear it.

W.R. heads for the front door, GRETCHEN, W.R.’s wife emerges
from the kitchen, Garry gets up and joins them, the family is
now gathered at the front door in stricken wonderment.

W.R.
(a deathly whisper)
Hello, Frank.

SLADE
Willie, there you are! Home for
Thanksgiving for a change. Charlie,
meet W.R. Slade, the original bulging
briefcase man. Went from Lading Clerk
on the Lackawanna Railroad to
bankruptcy referee in 12 easy jumps.
God breaks ’em and Willie busts ‘em.
Gretch! I smell those prunes! Are
we talking Turkey Marbella?!

He opens his arms in the direction of the kitchen, falls into
Gretchen, nuzzles her.

SLADE (contd)
Give us a whiff, you know I’ve always
had a sneaker for you.

In the confusion W.R., beet-red, turns to Charlie.

W.R.
Who are you? .

CHARLIE
I’m just here at the Waldorf-Astoria
Hotel with -- is it your brother?

Slade, who has had Gretchen backed against the wall, releases
her with mock romantic reluctance.
 

62.

SLADE
Garry, where’s my drink, it’s flowing
like mud around here?

He takes a swallow from his flask.

W.R.
(to Charlie)
Yes, he’s my brother. Who the hell
are you?

CHARLIE
I’m kind of his companion for a few
days -- umm -- to tell you the truth,
the Colonel is not well.

W.R.
‘Not well?!’

CHARLIE
He seems kind of lonely.

W.R.
Why don’t you take him to your
family’s for dinner?

Slade starts poking his way towards the living room, the family
parting at the wave of his cane.

SLADE
(to W.R.)
I meant to pick up some vino on the
way up, but I blew it. I’1l send you
the Rothschild again for Christmas --
but let’s see how Thanksgiving goes.

Gretchen opens the dining room doors.

GRETCHEN
‘Dinner is served’.

Randy presses a drink in Slade’s hand.

RANDY
Here you are, Frank.
SLADE
Still with Domino Sugar?
RANDY
Jack Frost. Why do you always get it -
wrong?
SLADE

Because it’s not important to me to
get it right. What are you now?

RANDY |
Vice-President for Marketing.

Slade sniffs

Slade’s cane

63.

SLADE

Congratulations. Sugar’s shit. I
told General Abrams to install honey
in the commissaries. If the K-50’s
didn’t blow your brains out, the sugar
would. Randy, may I tell you your
bosses killed more men than the Gooks?

(sniffs)
The olives are heating up, you knew
I was coming didn’t you, Gretch?

(to Charlie)
She stuffs the bird with olives and
prunes, Stays up all night to cook
it for me.

GAIL
Could we sit down?

Gail.

SLADE
Mitsouki.
(sniffs her again,
to Randy)
Rhymes with nookie. Watch out. When
the wife gets restless, the wife gets

racy.
W.R.
Let’s eat!
RANDY
(to Slade)

Where do you want to sit, Frank, or
are you going to arrange yourself at
the head again?

SLADE
Oh, any old card table will do.

hits the head of the table.

SLADE (contd)
This is fine.

He sits himself down.

SLADE (contd)
Charlie! Next to me!

INT. DINING ROOM - LATER ~ NIGHT . 46

Empty dishes, half-filled coffee cups, everybody in a stultified
glaze as Slade holds forth.
 

64.

SLADE
..-So what am I going to do, I’ve got
this Asian flower on the one hand, and
this Navy nurse-on the other, we’re
three across the bed, not a stitch of
clothes on and it comes to me. Let
East meet West and we’1l build The
Golden Bridge.

Gail looks as if she were about to throw up.

SLADE (contd)
I felt like I’d just joined the Corps
of Engineers.

Slade howls, his head darts about looking for approval, there
is none forthcoming. ‘The only affect is Charlie dying of
embarrassment.

RANDY
Did you always enjoy shocking people,
Uncle Frank?

GAIL
(cautioning)
Honey --

RANDY
Dad, remember the day you persuaded
Frank to go to the kennel?

SLADE
(to Randy)
What about it?

RANDY
(chuckling)
He almost put the seeing eye dog
business out of business.

W.R.
Randy, cool it.

He glances at Slade.

W.R. (contd)
(to Randy)
Water over the dam, son.

GARRY
Yes, over and done with.

SLADE
Indeed it is, Garry. And so is
dinner. What time is it, we’ve got
to be getting back?
 

65.

RANDY
Ever given any thought to a Braille
watch, Frank? Stevie Wonder wears one
er do you rank on him, too?

GAIL
Honey, please --

SLADE
That’s all right, Gloria, I enjoy
Randy's observations. I’ve always
found him a very amusing guy.

RANDY
My wife’s name is Gail.

SLADE
Excuse me. Gail -- strikes me as a
very beautiful young woman but there’s
a little tension in her voice. That
can mean one of two things -- Gail is
either nervous or unsatisfied.

RANDY
What’s your point, Uncle Frank?
SLADE
You ought to go down on her.
W.R.
Jee-zus.
SLADE
(to Randy)

You’ve gotten so wrapped up with the
sugar business, you’ve forgotten the
taste of honey.

GAIL
Frank, for god’s sakes!
SLADE
(to Gail)
Grace, I’ve always been crazy about
you.
RANDY
(to Slade)

Why don’t you get out of here? Take
that limousine down to the Bowery.
Get with the other lushes where you
belong.

CHARLIE
Hey, wait a minute --

RANDY .
What for, Chuckie, you think he’s
special because he’s blind?
66.

SLADE
My friend’s name is Charles.
CHARLIE
(to Randy)

Yes, he’s special and he’s blind.

RANDY
Another sucker who thinks this
shitheel is a war hero.

W.R.
Randy, that’s enough --

RANDY
(to Charlie)
He blew himself up.

GRETCHEN
Stop it, Randy.

RANDY
Our Colonel here had this grenade-
juggling act at Fort Bragg --

SLADE
Fort Benning.

RANDY
He was teaching hand-to-hand combat
to Second Lieutenants at the Infantry
School --

SLADE
Look at me, Randy, when you’re talking
to me.

RANDY
His partner in the act was some
Captain --

SLADE
Major Vincent Squires.

RANDY
Whoever he was, before going on,
they’d have themselves a lo-cal
breakfast. Screwdriver for Frank,
Bloody Mary for his partner.

SLADE .
vinnie drank Sea Breezes.

RANDY
The Judge-Advocate at Benning says
Colonel Slade had four to his
partner’s one.

(MORE)
 

67.

RANDY (contd)
He was really flying at class, he got
excited and started pulling the pins.
One grenade got away from him. The
pin was in, he claims. In or out,
what’s the difference, what kind of
showboating lunatic juggles grenades?

SLADE
Vinnie came out okay --

RANDY
And all Frank lost was his eyesight.
(to Charlie)

Well, he was an asshole before. Now
all he is, is a blind asshole. But
nothing could make me happier. Some
people don’t deserve to see. You get
the picture, Chuckie?

Suddenly Slade is up, jams Randy against the wall, he wraps his

arm terrifyingly around Randy’s neck.

SLADE
His name is Charles. You can say
that, can’t you? ‘Charles’.

Randy is choking, Gail and Gretchen screaming, W.R. and Garry
tear at Slade but he is too powerful for them.

SLADE (contd)
You know what this is, Randy? It’s
a chokehold, they teach it to you at
Ranger School. A little pressure and
I bust your windpipe. Now --
‘Charles’. After me -- ‘Charles’.

Randy, against the wall, has gone blue. Suddenly, between the
two combatants, Charlie shoves his way through. Slade senses
hin.

CHARLIE
c'mon, Colonel, c’mon =~

Unconsciously, Slade eases up. Gretchen and Gail are frozen at
the kitchen door, Garry blinks emptily and W.R. doesn’t know
which way to turn. Slade removes a pristine napkin which he had
tucked under his chin for dinner, dots both corners of his
mouth.

SLADE
Gretchen, you outdid yourself.

He releases the napkin, it drops on the floor in_a damask
crumple, Slade reaches out for Charlie, and Charlie is there in
an instant.
 

47

48

68.

SLADE (contd)

(to Gretchen)
If you twist my arm hard enough, and
we're talking Turkey Marbella next
year, who knows...?

A terrible SILENCE. Slade finds a wine glass on the table, any
glass, he starts to raise it to his lips.

W.R.
Frank?

A moment.

SLADE
Good-bye.

Slade extends his hand, W.R. looks at it, shakes it.

SLADE (contd)
Willie, I’m no fucking good and I
never have been.

Slade raises his wine in a toast.

SLADE (contd)
Here’s looking at you.

He taps the glass against his glass eye. PING! He polishes off
the wine. Charlie leads Slade out now, leaving W.R. and his
bewildered family behind.

EXT. W.R.’S HOUSE - WHITE PLAINS - NIGHT 47

Slade comes down the path towards the limo with Charlie. Manny
jumps out, opens the passenger door.

SLADE
Nueva York, compadre. Vamos.

Slade and Charlie get in, Manny closes the door, climbs behind
the wheel and drives them away.

INT. WALDORF SUITE - NIGHT 48

Charlie, toothbrush in hand, wanders into Slade’s bedroom.
Slade, his face wreathed in a lascivious smile, is propped up on
his pillows listening to the television where two big-breasted
women cavort topless on a water bed. Slade wears a patch,
beside him on a bedside table, a glass eye rests in a liquid
solution. Charlie notices it, the iris, colored a deep blue,
stares up intensely at him.

TV ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
..-A little taste of Cindy and Mindy,
the most delightful duet in town.
They will turn those dreams into a
reality. Our operators are waiting
by the phones --
 

69.

SLADE
What are they doing now?

CHARLIE
Colonel, you know what they’re doing.

SLADE
I’m blind, you little prick! What’s
happening?!

CHARLIE
It’s a sleaze show --

SLADE
‘Sleaze?!’ ‘Sleaze?!’ Cindy and
Mindy are the Meryl Streep of the New
Age.

CHARLIE
Okay, okay --

SLADE
You’re an employee, Simms. Keep your
opinions to yourself.

Slade sips from his flask, shakes a pill out of a bottle.

CHARLIE
What are you doing, taking pills with
liquor?!

Charlie snatches the bottle of pills away from Slade, tries to
read the label.

CHARLIE (contd)
squinting)
What are these?

SLADE
My German downers. Give ‘em back
here.

CHARLIE

Colonel Slade --

SLADE
GIVE ‘EM BACK!

Charlie hands him the pills.
SLADE (contd)
Pull duty with NATO, you eat and drink
like a king, then they send you to a
spa to sweat it out.

He washes the pill down with whiskey, caps the bottle lovingly.
 

70.

SLADE (contd)
Baden-Baden. Every night they award
you one of these little greenies and
you sleep like a gnome in the Black
Forest.

He shakes the bottle of pills, enjoying the SOUND.

__SLADE (contd)
They’re still green, aren’t they?

Charlie gets up and heads for his room.

SLADE (contd)
Hey, runt!

Charlie turns around.

SLADE (contd)
Where are you going?

CHARLIE
Back to bed.

Slade smiles enigmatically, Charlie stares anxiously at him, but
Slade’s eye is blinking closed peacefully. Charlie moves out to

the sitting room now, tries to fix up his mussed-up bed, but he
can’t get comfortable. He lies there in the darkness.

A THUD. Charlie jumps up, runs into Slade’s room, Slade has
fallen out of bed, is lying face-down beside it. On the night
table the bottle of German sleeping pills, now empty, lies on
its side.

CHARLIE
Colonel! Colonel!

He shakes him desperately.

CHARLIE (contd)
For God’s sake, wake up!

Slade lies still, his jaw slack, Charlie lunges for the
telephone but keeps Slade in view, Slade’s one eye opens and
Charlie blinks into the shining, sea-blue iris. Suddenly
Slade’s face lights up, breaks into a smile, he starts laughing,
feels under the skirt of the bedside table, pulls out a little
vase into which he has poured the pills, now spills them back
in the bottle.

SLADE -
You’re easy --

Charlie hangs up the phone.

CHARLIE
That’s not funny.
49

 

71.

SLADE
Charlie, my boy, you got no sense of
humor.

Slade leans back in bed, presses a button on the TV remote,
another access channel comes on, the host is interviewing a
transsexual.

. CHARLIE
It’s time you went to sleep,
Colonel --

SLADE

At ease, son.

Charlie watches Slade "watching" television. He reaches for the
light switch, gently turns it off.

CHARLIE
(softly)
Good night.

SLADE
Shush, this is fascinating.

INT. WALDORF SUITE - NEXT MORNING 49

Charlie wakes up, hears a CLICKING sound from the direction of
Slade’s room. CLICK-CLICK, the sound repeats itself, then
repeats itself again, it is unearthly in the dark of the
morning, like some creature from another planet.

Charlie gets up, opens the door between the rooms, the light
from his room barely illuminates Slade who is sitting in a wing
chair, a side table pulled up in front of him. The extra
blanket from his bed is folded in half over the table.

SLADE
You got a watch?

Charlie looks at the clock besides Slade’s bed.

CHARLIE
It’s 7:19.

SLADE
I didn’t ask the time, I want to know
whether you got a watch?

CHARLIE *
Yes. In my roon.

SLADE
Get it.

Charlie hesitates, another CLICK.
 

72.

LIE

There’s a clock right beside your bed,
Colonel --

SLADE
Does it have a second hand?

CHARLIE
Yes --

SLADE
Time me.

Charlie switches on the light, Slade is holding a .45 in his
hand. Slade signals Charlie to start timing him, in what seems
like an instant Slade has dismantled the gun, every part comes
out and is laid in perfect position on the blanket in front of
him, just as quickly he reassembles it, cocks it, dry-fires.

SLADE (contd)
How long?

Charlie hesitates, decides to go along.

CHARLIE
(checking Slade’s
bedside clock)
49 seconds.

SLADE
I‘’m rusty.

He starts to take the pistol apart again, slowly, feeling the
parts, taking a lot of pleasure in the process.

CHARLIE
Where’d you get the gun, Colonel?

SLADE
Piece or weapon, Charlie, never a gun.

CHARLIE
Where’d you get the piece?

SLADE
I’m an officer in the United States
Army, this is my sidearm.

CHARLIE
You’re not an officer anymore -~

SLADE
So I’m retired, so what? An officer
never relinquishes his .45.

CHARLIE
you better relinquish it to_me or I’m
going to have to call Mrs. Rossi.
 

73.

SLADE
Good idea.

CHARLIE
And then I’m going back to school.

SLADE
Blue skies, green lights, I hope you
have a wonderful trip.

CLICK, CLICK, Slade has reassembled the pistol in rapid time.

SLADE (contd)
That felt like 45 seconds. You should
be able to do a .45 in 45. Did you
time me?

CHARLIE
No, I did not. And I’m calling
Albany.

He searches in his pathetic wallet, finds Karen’s slip of paper,
carefully unfolds it when suddenly Slade, quick as a cat, has
snatched it out of his hand, balled up the piece of paper and
swallowed it.

Charlie regards him, Slade’s Adam’s apple still bobbing.

CHARLIE (contd)
That was stupid.

SLADE
You’re stuck with me.

CHARLIE
No, I’m not, I’m out of here.

SLADE
How? All the way to New Hampshire on
no money? Ever hitchhiked on the West
Side Highway? You’ll end up hog-tied
in a dumpster in Hackensack.

CHARLIE
You don’t scare me.

SLADE
You scare me, Charlie.
(sings)
‘Charlie, my boy
Oh, Charlie, my boy
You thrill me, you chill me
With shivers of joy...’

SNAP, Slade has taken apart the .45 again, his fingers are like
a watchmaker’s with the gun.
 

74.

SLADE (contd)

(rubbing his stomach)
Karen’s number tastes like Albany.

(tilts his head)
I’m headed for Arlington, Charlie. I
got my plot all picked out, section
46, next to Audie Murphy’s. They may
give you a hard time because The
Unknown Soldier area is high-rent, but
be firm, tell them I qualify on every
count -- 100% disability, Silver Star,
20-year man, active duty, authentic
Purple Heart.

CLICK-CLICK, Slade has reassembled the pistol, Charlie reaches
for it, Slade extends the pistol at arm’s length, out of
Charlie’s grasp.

SLADE (contd)
If they give you a hard time on
Section 46, ask for a space near Joe
Louis’ or Abner Doubleday’s. I always
liked baseball.

CHARLIE
Give me the gun, Colonel.

SLADE
An officer never gives up his sidearm,
I told you.

CHARLIE
In that case, I’m leaving.

Charlie takes a step towards his room.

SLADE
Charlie!

Charlie stops.

SLADE (contd)
(carefully)
All I want from you is another day.

- Silence.

CHARLIE
For what?

Slade throws up his hands spontaneously.

SLADE
One last tour of the battlefield. I
can get around in a big city like New
York but now and then, I need a point
in the right direction. What’s a day
between friends?
 

A moment.

He tilts his

75.

CHARLIE
Say I stay for another day, will you
give me your weapon?

SLADE
I’m a Lieutenant-Colonel in the United
States Army and I’m not giving my
fucking gun to anybody. What are you
drinking?

flask, takes a huge swallow.

CHARLIE
Colonel, this is unacceptable.

SLADE
‘unacceptable?!’ Don’t give me any
of that prep school crap. Have they
already taken the Oregon out of the
boy and turned it into Harvard
Business School?

Slade cackles.

CHARLIE
Okay, give me the bullets.
SLADE
My ammo?
CHARLIE
You want to be next to Joe Louis or
not?
SLADE

You do see the sense of it, Charlie,
don’t you? I can’t chew the leather
anymore. So why should I share in the
tribe’s provisions?

CHARLIE
(firmly)
The bullets, Colonel.

SLADE
‘The bullets, Colonel.’ You sound
like a guy in ‘Lives of a Bengal
Lancer.’ Next thing you'll be asking
for my blindfold and cigarette.

CLICK, CLICK, Slade removes the magazine, flips it to Charlie,
he catches it.

SLADE (contd)
What do you give a shit for?
 

Slade stands

76.

CHARLIE
About what?

LADE
About whether I blow my brains out or
not.

CHARLIE
Because I have a conscience.

SLADE
Oh yes, I forgot. The ‘Charlie’
conscience. Do we tell or do we not
tell? Do we follow the rich boy’s
code or not? Do we let the blind
asshole check out? When were you
born, Charlie, at The Round Table?
Haven’t you heard, conscience is dead?

CHARLIE
No, I haven’t heard.

SLADE
THEN TAKE THE WAX OUT OF YOUR EARS AND
GROW UP! Fuck your buddy, cheat on
your wife, call your mother on
Mother’s Day. It’s all shit.

up.

CHARLIE
Where are you going?

SLADE
To take a leak. I know I said only
a day, but even I can’t hold it that
long.

The phone RINGS, Charlie answers it.

CHARLIE
Hello.
(to Slade)
It’s for you -- Manny...

Slade doesn’t respond.

CHARLIE (contd)
...the limo driver.

Slade takes the phone.

SLADE
Colonel Slade...yes, Manny...Fifth
Avenue?..-really?...all right, give
her my name, tell her she’1ll be
hearing from me...no, no special
needs...you did good, hombre.
50

 

77.

He hangs up.

SLADE (contd)
Get dressed -- the battlefield awaits.

Slade turns towards the bathroom.

SLADE (contd)
And Charlie...you forgot the one in
the chamber.

Slade instantly cocks and uncocks the pistol, expelling the
bullet, which tumbles in a harmless arc, landing at Charlie’s
feet. Slade spins his .45 cowboy-style, drops it into his

bathrobe pocket and disappears into the bathroon.
INT. WALDORF-ASTORIA BARBER SHOP - DAY 50

A Manicurist works on Slade’s fingernails, a Bootblack does his
Shoes while a Barber gives him a shave. Charlie paces in the
narrow alley behind the ornate chair.

SLADE
...No haircut, Charlie? Take a shave.
Let this old pro loose on your peach
fuzz, you’ll feel like a new man.

CHARLIE
No shave, thanks.

SLADE
(to Barber)
I’m trying to get him laid.

The Bootblack finishes Slade’s shine with a flourish.

SLADE
(to Bootblack)
Thank you, sir.

BOOTBLACK
These are good shoes.

SLADE
(to Charlie)
You hear that?
(to Bootblack)
Twenty-six years in the service, I
never let an aide shine my shoes.

He senses Charlie pacing behind hin.

: SLADE (contd)
Where will you be in twenty-six years,
Charlie? Playing golf, 1/11 bet, with
those friends of yours from The Baird
School.

\
 

51

78.

CHARLIE
I don’t even like those guys.

SLADE
Of course you don’t. They’re
assholes. “It’1ll be a pleasure to
squeal.

CHARLIE
I’m not a squealer.

SLADE
What is this, The Dreyfus Case?
Refresh my memory. You and, what's
the other guy’s name again -~ ?

CHARLIE
George Willis.

SLADE
You and George Willis saw who do what?

CHARLIE
Harry Havemeyer and two of his buddies
pour concrete into Dean Trask’s
Jaguar.

SLADE
Good grief! Vanden Plas or a J6?

A nonplussed Charlie doesn’t answer.

SLADE (contd)
Never mind, are you worried that Harry
Havemeyer’s going to get the boot?
Not with a name like that.

Slade, whose shave is finished, stands up, wipes his face clean .
with the barber sheet. A moody silence surrounds Charlie. f

SLADE (contd)
I’m getting that heavy feeling again,
Charlie.
EXT. FIFTH AVENUE - AFTERNOON 51
Slade strides along, his hand resting on Charlie’s arm.

CHARLIE
...I was offered a bribe. ~

SLADE
Now we’re cooking.

CHARLIE
Dean Trask said he would see to it
that I got into Harvard --
 

52

79.

SLADE
If you squeal?

CHARLIE
Yes.

SLADE
What a dilemma. Should Charlie Simms
accept a free ride into Harvard or
not? What do you think your friend
George would do if he were in your
shoes?

CHARLIE
He is, practically. Except the Dean
hasn’t promised to get him into
Harvard.

SLADE
He doesn’t have to. George’s father
will take care of that.
(a moment)
Do the deal, Charlie. Take it. Go
to Harvard.

CHARLIE
I can’t do that.

Slade stops.

SLADE
Why not?

CHARLIE
There are some things you can’t do.

SLADE
Charlie, my boy, you’re going to have
a hard time in this world.
(a moment)
To soften the blow, let me buy you a
drink.

INT. GRAND FOYER, FIFTH AVENUE HOTEL - AFTERNOON 52

. The lush atmosphere of an ornate public room, tea tables and

gilt chairs, palm fronds and ficus trees surround a dance floor.
The chatter of a sophisticated New York crowd mingles with the
music of an elegant trio. A Waiter is taking Slade’s order for
drinks. *

SLADE
Double Jack Daniels on the rocks.
Bring the young man a Shirley Temple.

CHARLIE
Not so fast.
(to Waiter)
You got beer?
 

80.

WAITER
Yes. Can I see some I.D.?

Slade raises his cane to the Waiter.

SLADE
Interested in walking the rest of your
life, Chappie?

WAITER
Sir, I --

SLADE
I’m a regular here. My boy’s going
on twenty-three. Speak to Mr. Gilbert
in the front office, he’s a friend of
mine.

The Waiter weighs the situation.

WAITER
(to Charlie)
Any particular beer?

SLADE
Schlitz. No Schlitz, Blatz.

The Waiter goes, Slade punches Charlie on the shoulder.

. SLADE (contd)
You’re human.

(peering around)
Who are we drinking with? I’m getting
a nice, soap-and-water feeling next

to us.
CHARLIE
Female.
SLADE
‘Female!’ Hey!
(cackles)

If you’re calling her ‘female,’ you
must like her or you wouldn’t be
playing it so casual. Chestnut hair?

CHARLIE
Brown.
SLADE ,
22? ~
CHARLIE

What am I, a guy at a carnival?

Slade drills Charlie with his blind stare.
 

81.

SLADE
The day we stop looking, Charlie, is
the day we are dead.
(after a moment)
Move.

where? CHARLIE
ere?

SLADE
You know where.

Slade gets up, chuckling excitedly.

SLADE (contd)
Charlie, this girl was made for you.
God-dam beautiful, isn’t she?

CHARLIE
Not bad.

SLADE
Bingo! The boy’s alive.

In fact, DONNA, the young woman at the adjacent table, is a
knockout.

SLADE (contd)
(nudging Charlie)
c'mon, son, perambulate, perambulate!

Charlie, embarrassed, gets up and steers Slade towards Donna.

Hiding behind Slade, Charlie does a weird balancing act between
being present and not being present.

SLADE (contd)
(to Donna)

Excuse me, senorita, could we join
you?

Donna takes in this pair, the stunning, blind, middle-aged man
and his young, awkward companion.

DONNA
(pleasantly)

Well, I am expecting somebody.

SLADE
He’s here?

DONNA .
No, but any minute --

SLADE

Okay, ‘any minute.’ What are you
doing right now?
 

DONNA
(smiles)
I’m waiting for him.

SLADE
So you don’t mind if we wait with you?

Donna smiles again.

DONNA
No.

Slade has already pulled up a chair. He sits down, Charlie

joins him as Slade leans into Donna.

SLADE
You smell like a bar of Ogilvie
Sisters soap.

A moment.
DONNA
That’s amazing.
SLADE
Good, I’m in the amazing business.
DONNA

It is Ogilvie Sisters soap.
(to Charlie)

Granny gave me three bars for

Christmas.

SLADE
I’m crazy about your grandmother. And
I think she would have liked Charlie,

too.
CHARLIE
(to Donna)
Don’t pay any attention to him.
SLADE
What’s your name?
DONNA
Donna.
SLADE

Hi Donna, I’m Frank and...

DONNA
That’s Charlie.

SLADE
(to Charlie)
She likes you.

Donna laughs, she is looking right at Charlie now.

82.
 

83.

SLADE (contd)
(seductively)
What’s that music?

DONNA
Samba. Or is it a tango?

Donna’s shoulders sway gently.

SLADE

Yes, it’s a tango. You tango, Donna?
DONNA

I love to. But --
SLADE

But what?
DONNA

Michael doesn’t.
SLADE

‘Michael,’ who you’re waiting for.
DONNA

Michael thinks the tango’s hysterical.
SLADE

Tell Michael I think he’s hysterical.
CHARLIE

(to Donna)

Don’t pay any attention to him. Or
did I say that already?

Donna giggles.

SLADE

You know the name of this tango?
DONNA

Tangos have names?
SLADE

Of course, this one’s called La

Punalada.
Slade’s Spanish is perfect.

SLADE (contd) ~
You know what that means?

DONNA
No --

SLADE
‘The Stab.’

Donna risks another look at Charlie.
 

84.

: SLADE (contd)
Would you like to dance?

Donna checks with Charlie, he gives a reassuring nod and, in
this moment, endears himself to Donna completely. Slade and
Donna rise.

SLADE (contd)
(to Donna)
Your arm?

Slade takes Donna’s arn.

SLADE (contd)
I need some coordinates here, Charlie.

Charlie leans into Slade.

CHARLIE
You're looking at about forty by
twenty. You/re facing the long end.
Halfway down on the left there’s a
palm plant sticking out, on the right
side’s the band --

Slade puts up his hand to tacit Charlie, hands him his cane.
He moves out to the dance floor with Donna, she raises her arms,
he takes hold of them, and in an instant they are into a tango.

Slade is a marvelous dancer, he moves in perfect consonance with
the music, at first it is all Donna can do to keep up with him
put he leads so brilliantly, after a while she becomes a perfect
partner. The little trio is into the number now, the dance
floor clearing for Slade and Donna, the tempo speeds up,
rivulets of sweat run down Donna’s cheek but the Colonel remains
cool and precise and in command. As Donna dances, her eyes keep
meeting Charlie’s eyes when suddenly, with a great glissando,
the tango ends and the trio takes a brief break but first they,
and the customers at the tables, applaud.

Donna leads Slade back to Charlie.

DONNA
Frank, you are one incredible dancer.

SLADE
Wait ‘til you see Charlie.
CHARLIE
He’s a liar, I don’t dance.
SLADE
(to Donna)

Isn’t he a charmer? Truth is, not
only can he dance, he can sing you a
helluva tune.

DONNA
La Punalada.
 

85.

SLADE
The stab.

Silence, Charlie looks from Slade to Donna and back again.
MICHAEL, an attractive young man, approaches, he carries an
attache case.

MICHAEL
Hi, honey.

DONNA
Hey!

They embrace.

DONNA (contd)
This is Frank and this is Charlie.

MICHAEL
Hi Frank, hi Charlie.
(to Donna)
Sorry I’m late --

DONNA
That’s okay, these two guys
entertained me. I got to tell you,
the time flew.

SLADE
(to Michael)
Your girl does a helluva tango.

MICHAEL
(to Donna)
At last. You found someone to tango
with.
(smiling, to Charlie)
Let me shake your hand.

He pumps Charlie’s hand.

DONNA
No, no, it was Frank --
MICHAEL
What the hell, I’11 shake both your

hands.
Michael pumps Slade’s ‘and Charlie’s hands.

MICHAEL (contd)
Honey, this looks like ‘the place,’
but we got a date with Darryl and
Carol in the village.

DONNA
Okay, okay -~
 

53

86.

Michael reaches in his pocket to pay the check, his change
jingles.

SLADE
Take your hand out of your pocket,
Michael, I/’11 get this.

MICHAEL
Why thank you.

Donna kisses Frank, and now she kisses Charlie. Then suddenly
she hurries away.

MICHAEL (contd)
‘Bye, guys.

And Donna and Michael are gone. Charlie watches them disappear
as Slade stares in the direction where Michael last stood.

SLADE
(emptily)
‘Darryl and Carol.’

INT. P.J. CLARKE’S, THIRD AVENUE - NIGHT : 53

Slade and Charlie are perched at the bar, drinking, and eating
cheeseburgers. They are like the eye of a storm in an excited
holiday crowd, junior executives, male and female sizing each
other up, some already coupled.

SLADE
Soap, for Christ’s sake! Twenty-two
years old and she smells of soap and
water! God, that’s a once ina
lifetime thing and what happened? You
blew it!

CHARLIE
Blew what?

SLADE
That girl was crazy about you.

CHARLIE
Me? She was getting ready to have
kittens with you on the dance floor.

SLADE
That’s the point. She was coming on
to me but it was you who she wanted. x
It’s the oldest trick in the world.

CHARLIE
I think you’re wrong. It was you that
she liked. And you know she liked
you, you just don’t want to admit it.
 

87.

SLADE
Watch it, I/’11 do the mind-fucking
around here.

CHARLIE
We should have all gone to dinner.
Then you and Donna could have snuck
off and danced the night away.

SLADE
And then what?

CHARLIE
You tell me.

Slade summons the bartender.

SLADE
Triple Jack Daniels, and another beer
for the professor.

CHARLIE
I’ve moved up to ‘professor’.

SLADE
That’s for the cretin behind the bar.
I don’t want him worrying about the
Beverage Commission.
(a final bite)
This is my last cheeseburger.

CHARLIE
That bad, huh?

Slade smiles at Charlie’s attempt at a joke.

SLADE
I feel like eating it all over again.

CHARLIE
Let's get you one, 1/11 spring for it.
SLADE
Thanks, Charlie, I’m full. But I’m
empty, if you know what I mean.
The bartender serves up the new round of drinks.
SLADE (contd)
(to Charlie)
Ever hear that song of Frank
Sinatra’s, ‘My Way?’
Charlie nods, sings a little bit of it.

SLADE (contd)
I hate that song.

Charlie smiles.
88.

SLADE (contd)
I did it my way but my way’s no
fucking good.
(a moment)
You won’t make the same mistakes I
did, will you?

CHARLIE
I don’t know, I don’t have a way yet.

SLADE
Oh yes, you do. You’re a giver,
Charlie. A helper. A reacher-out.
Very valuable --

CHARLIE
You think so?

SLADE
Great with women. They love that
stuff. If I’d understood women, I
could’ve ruled the world.

CHARLIE
Donna sure went for you.

SLADE
Maybe. The truth is, Charlie, with
women I didn’t wear well. But that’s
nothing against women. Men felt the
same way.

. CHARLIE
I think you’re being hard on yourself.

SLADE
Isn’t it about time?

CHARLIE
Everybody’s got problems. It’s how
you work them out. You’re a marvelous
man and you got a lot to offer --

SLADE
Don’t blow smoke up my ass, you’ll
ruin my autopsy.

CHARLIE
Your reasons for killing yourself are
invalid, Colonel. I’d love to ‘tear
a herring’ with you and I/1l bet
there’s plenty others standing in line
behind me -- if you’d only give us a
chance.

Slade stares at Charlie.

 

 
 

89.

SLADE
I got a phone, Charlie. In the last
two months I received one call. They
were trying to sell me The Boston
Globe. I decided against it. But TI
enjoyed talking to then.

Charlie regards Slade, Slade senses him, reaches out, rumples
Charlie’s hair a little too roughly.

SLADE (contd)
The head is slightly underdeveloped.
Oregon out of the Boy Scouts by Mom’s
Apple Pie.

Slade’s hand falls to Charlie’s chest.

SLADE (contd)
But you know something, Charlie my
boy, in parts your heart is good.
Play it smart. Give a little now and
then so you can get what you want.

CHARLIE
Sell out?

SLADE
In installments. To the highest
bidder.

Charlie switches drinks with Slade, swaps his beer for Slade’s
shot of Jack Daniels. Takes a sip, winces.

CHARLIE
You don’t believe a word of that.

Slade smiles.

SLADE
No.

CHARLIE
All that stuff about squealing and
running for cover and doing the deal
-- that was all bullshit, wasn’t it?

SLADE
Yes.

Charlie drains the Jack Daniels, exhales at the strength of the
drink. Slade, for the moment, has fallen silent.

SLADE (contd)
I used to come here with Big Ed for
brandies after ‘21’. We’d sit in the
pack over there -~

Charlie looks around, plugs into the charged atmosphere of
paired-off singles.
 

54

90.

SLADE (contd)
We never went home alone. Things were
different then, Charlie.

After a sudden and deep silence, Slade turns to a woman on his
eft.

> SLADE (contd)
Dance?

The woman, frightened, swivels away.
SLADE (contd)
No?

Slade sits for a moment, then steps off his barstool, drifts
towards a dark, empty area next to the jukebox, and dances
alone. He moves like a sylph and Charlie, for the instant,
gives himself up to Slade, enjoys it.

Suddenly, Slade calls to Charlie.

SLADE (contd)
Get a hold of Manny. Tell him ‘now’.

Slade is staring blindly but intently at Charlie and it is not
until Charlie crosses to a pay phone, that he resumes dancing.

EXT./INT. LIMO, STREET - NIGHT 54

Slade and Charlie are seated in the back of the limo, it is
parked in the east 60’s just off 5th Avenue, Manny at the wheel,
the lights out. Charlie is peering through the limo window at a
brownstone down the street.

|. CHARLIE
I’d say it’s about twenty steps --
SLADE
Yards. Always give it to me in yards,
Charlie.
CHARLIE
About fifteen yards, and there’s
stairs --
SLADE
A stoop. How many?
CHARLIE “

one, two, three...looks like nine.

SLADE
Nine steps up. Railing?

CHARLIE
No railing.
 

91.
SLADE
Bell?
CHARLIE
There’s a shiny, brass plate on the
right, about shoulder high.

SLADE
How do you know it’s not the mailbox?

CHARLIE
This mailbox has got an ivory button
in the middle.

SLADE
Good work.

Slade leans towards Charlie.

SLADE (contd)
How’s my part?

Charlie checks Slade’s hair.

CHARLIE
Straight as an arrow.

Slade fluffs up his pocket handkerchief.

SLADE

I got the red foulard okay, didn’t I?
CHARLIE

Real dark red --
SLADE

Burgundy! Burgundy, Charlie! They

love it.
Slade takes a deep breath, exhales, sniffs.

SLADE (contd)
(to himself)
Bay Run.
(adjusts his tie)
Windsor knot.

He swings open the door of the car and steps out. As he
straightens himself up on the street, he turns back once towards
Charlie, throws him a happy, mini-salute, walks on down towards
the brownstone. Manny and Charlie are tracking Slade as he-
moves unerringly to the bottom of the brownstone’s steps, climbs
them, rings the bell, a black woman in a formal maid’s uniform
admits him, closes the burnished wood door.

An awkward silence.

MANNY
You know, Charlie...
 

92.

CHARLIE
Yeah?

MANNY
Normally, I don’t do no whoring and
pimping around for the customers.

CHARLIE
I’m sure you don’t, Manny.
(after a moment)
This your first time?

MANNY
Well...

Another moment.

MANNY (contd)
Maybe when I first purchased the car,
I had this big balloon payment. But
the Colonel, you know, Charlie --

CHARLIE
What about him?

MANNY
The Colonel is a gentleman.

CHARLIE
A gentleman?

MANNY
Class.

Charlie weighs Manny’s sincerity, regards the burnished wood
door down the street. He reaches for the car phone.

CHARLIE
Can you get long distance on this?

MANNY
And how. Be my guest.

Charlie unfolds a piece of hotel memo paper from his wallet,
dials.

CHARLIE
George Willis, please.

Hello? HARRY (V.0.)
ello?

CHARLIE
Harry?

HARRY (V.0.)
Chas. You just caught us. We were
chauffeuring George to the airport.
 

CHARLIE
What’s he going to th

e@ airport for?

HARRY (V.0.)
Hold on, why don’t you talk to the man

himself?

Charlie waits.

Chas...

CHARLIE
Hi, George.

GEORGE (V.0.)

GEORGE (V.0.)

You just caught me.

CHARLIE :
That’s what Harry said. Where’re you
going?

GEORGE (V.O.)
Home.

CHARLIE
To Boston?

GEORGE (V.0.)
Catching the puddle-jumper. Keep your

fingers crossed.

CHARLIE

Why are you going home?

GEORGE (V.O.)

I was thinking, Chas,

this asshole

Trask is making no sense at all.
Somebody’s got to talk to him. My

father’s class of '59

CHARLIE

Your father? I thought we were going
to keep our parents out of this.

GEORGE (V.0O.)
This guy Trask’s out of control. Dad

will bring him to his
a major fundraiser, y

CHARLIE
No, I didn’t.

senses. He’s
ou know.

GEORGE (V.0.)
Relax, he’ll get us off the hook, hey

-- what time is it?

CHARLIE
A quarter to ten.

93.
 

55

56

94.

GEORGE (V.0.)
Whoa, I gotta go. Everything all
right?
CHARLIE
sure.

GEORGE (V.0.)
See you Monday. ‘Bye.

Charlie hangs up, slumps in the seat, stares at the phone.
EXT./INT. LIMO, STREET - NIGHT - LATER "55

Through the window of the car, Manny can be seen sound asleep,
his hat tilted over his eyes. :

The door to the brownstone opens and Slade emerges, counts down
the steps, makes a left turn up the street to the limo. Charlie
swings the car door open and Slade slides inside. He seems
completely at peace.

After a long silence:

SLADE
What a beautiful woman.

Manny, awake now, smiles at Charlie in the rearview mirror.
Charlie nods, Manny starts up the car, Slade sinking into the
backseat, all afterglow and dreamy wondrousness as they drive
away.

INT. WALDORF SUITE - NEXT AFTERNOON 56

Charlie is watching television, Sally Jessy Raphael interviewing
a couple. He checks his watch, opens the door to Slade’s room.
Slade is fast asleep. Charlie edges towards him, touches a
shoulder, an eye opens.

CHARLIE
You okay?

Slade nods drowsily, but the eye closes. Charlie shakes him
awake.

: CHARLIE (contd)
Wake up, Colonel.

The eye opens again. Slade shakes his head irritably.

SLADE -
What is it?

CHARLIE .
It's afternoon, you’ve been sleeping
all day.

SLADE
So what?
 

95.

CHARLIE
I talked to George last night. His
father’s a big-deal alumnus, he’s got
a lot of clout.

No response.

CHARLIE (contd)
He’s going to talk to the Dean.
George thinks his father might be able
to get us off the hook.

SLADE
That’s what he said?

CHARLIE
Yeah.

SLADE

Watch the ‘us’ part.
Slade turns over, away from Charlie. Charlie regards hin.

CHARLIE
Hey, Colonel, don’t you want to get
out and do something?

SLADE
Do what?

CHARLIE
...See the Statue of Liberty, visit
the Empire State Building -- do
something.

Slade’s one eye closes again, his head slumps back into the
pillow. Charlie walks around to the other side of the bed,
rocks him, the eye opens.

SLADE
What do you want, Charlie?

CHARLIE
I don’t know, you’re making me
nervous.

SLADE
You've got last-day-of-combat jitters.
Your tour of duty is almost over.

Slade’s eye stares into the middle distance.

SLADE (contd)
My money belt’s under the mattress.
Take out your plane ticket and four
hundred dollars. Mustering-out
pay plus airport-to-school taxi.
 

96.

CHARLIE
Hey, no rush, Colonel, I can stay a
while --

SLADE

Charlie, you already gave me a day and
for that I’1l1 be eternally grateful.
Right now, I have other plans.

A moment.
CHARLIE
(carefully)
What other plans have you got?
SLADE
To die.
CHARLIE
Oh no, Colonel, you’re not going to
die today.
SLADE

Much as I value your opinion, that is
not your decision. Go away now and
let me sleep.

Charlie squats by the bed, speaks quietly into Slade’s ear.
CHARLIE
Let’s start over, Colonel. What do
you feel like doing today?
No response.

CHARLIE (contd)
Look at this. The sun is shining,
it’s a beautiful day.

Silence.
CHARLIE (contd)
We don’t want to sit around and molder
in this hotel room, do we?
More silence.
CHARLIE (contd)
Don’t be a party poop, Colonel Slade.
Let’s get out of here, go for a ride.
Slade’s eyelid flutters.

CHARLIE (contd)
Yeah, a ride.

The sun is streaming in now, hitting Slade’s face, he seems to
relax for a instant.
 

57

58

97.

SLADE
A ride?

CHARLIE
Yeah, a wild ride. A lip-biting,
bone-rattling, double-clutching,
mother-fucking ride!

Slade shrugs noncommittally at Charlie’s outburst, but a trace
of a smile flickers over his face. Charlie catches it, hunches
his shoulders purposefully.

CHARLIE (contd)
A ride, it is.

EXT. PARK AVENUE - AFTERNOON 57

Charlie leads Slade up the street. Charlie strides on
purposefully, a passive Slade leaning on his arn.

INT. FERRARI DEALERSHIP, PARK AVENUE - AFTERNOON 58

Slade stares distantly out the window into the busy street as
Charlie, standing next to a gleaming car, is locked in
conversation with Fred Bisco. Other salesmen are around today,
they watch bemusedly.

FRED
...Yes, this is a valid Oregon
driver’s license and yes, we let
appropriate customers test drive the
Testarossa. But 17-year-olds with a
blind companion, that we don’t do.

CHARLIE
The Colonel is not my companion, I’m
his.

FRED

very nice. But this is a hundred and
ninety thousand dollar piece of
machinery, and I’m not letting it out
this door.

Charlie moves to another model.

CHARLIE
How about this one?

FRED ~
The 348 ts, same deal. I’m not
letting an unaccompanied kid get
behind the wheel of a hundred and
thirteen thousand dollar piece of
machinery.

As Charlie moves on through the showroom with Fred, they come
within earshot of Slade.
 

98.

SLADE
(quietly)
He will not be unaccompanied, I’11 be
with him. I’m his father.

Fred stops, turns back to Slade.

FRED
You’re his father?

Fred looks from Charlie to Slade and back to Charlie again.
FRED (contd)
I got an idea. Why don’t I take Dad
for a ride?

Slade is at odds with himself, he remains oddly quiet and
passive, but Fred is an irritation he can’t ignore.

SLADE
What’s your quota, Freddie?
FRED
Quota?
SLADE
How many Ferraris you sold this month?
FRED
Uh --
SLADE

The market’s down, isn’t it? These
things are not exactly walking out of
the store.

FRED
The Ferrari is the finest piece of
machinery sold in the automotive
world.

SLADE
So what are you going to do, sleep in
it or sell it?

Fred regards Slade.

FRED
Sir, I’d love to accommodate you but

SLADE
Do we close or not? This vehicle
performs like I expect it to, you/’ll
have a certified check for a hundred
and four thousand and change when you
open up tomorrow.
 

59

FRED
One hundred and thirteen thousand,
eight hundred dollars.

SLADE
Freddie, for you, one-oh-seven and a
case of champagne. To go with your
leftover turkey.

Fred shifts, glances at Charlie who is inscrutable, now directs
his attention back to Slade.

FRED
Can you testify to your son’s driving
ability?
SLADE
He got his learner's permit from Mario
Andretti.
Fred smiles, starts walking towards the drive-out area.

FRED

...35 miles an hour on city streets,
you know.
SLADE

Not a revolution over.
EXT. FERRARI DEALERSHIP, PARK AVENUE - DAY

Charlie emerges at the wheel of a Ferrari-red 348 ts, a tense
Slade in the seat beside him, orienting himself to the noisy
raffic.

EXT. WEST SIDE HIGHWAY - AFTERNOON

A red bullet flies up the highway, MOVE IN on the Ferrari,
Charlie hunched over the wheel, the window on the passenger side
zips down, pointing the way with his cane now is Slade.

INT. FERRARI - CROSS-BRONX EXPRESSWAY ~ AFTERNOON

Stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic, Charlie raises the
convertible top and he and Slade are now fully visible, Slade
flourishing his cane, remonstrating with the driver of a huge
semi. As the traffic releases past a bottleneck, Charlie »icks
up speed, the red lozenge of a car slips past everybody, down
the ramp, and onto the Harlem River Drive.

INT, FERRARI - AFTERNOON ~

Charlie is all business at the wheel. Slade’s head bobs in the
vacuum of ‘the windscreen, it is hard for him to suppress his
excitement. A big diesel horn is BLOWN at them and Slade waves
his cane in acknowledgement.

EXT. EAST RIVER DRIVE - AFTERNOON 63
Charlie picks his way expertly through traffic, under the
Queensboro, down past Stuyvesant Town, and across the Brooklyn
Bridge. As the World Trade Center gleams in the background,

Slade, like an oblivious child, starts to stand up in his seat,

but Charlie yanks him down.

EXT. WAREHOUSE AREA - AFTERNOON 64
A warehouse area under the Brooklyn Bridge, the sun shining
brightly on cobblestone streets deserted on this holiday

weekend. The Ferrari is nowhere in sight.

CHARLIE (V.0.)
Just take it easy, man.

SLADE (V.0.)
Is it clear...or is it clear?

CHARLIE (V.O.)
Wide open.

The 348 ts now emerges from around the corner of a building.
Slade is at the wheel.

CHARLIE
Straight! Straight!

The Colonel is beside himself with excitement. He picks up
speed.

CHARLIE (contd)
For Christ sake, slow down, Colonel!
SLADE
Hold on, Charlie, I think we got
another gear here -~-

The car goes even faster.

CHARLIE
COLONEL SLADE!

Slade, his shoulders rocking, is dancing with the Ferrari,
Charlie hides his head.
SLADE
Now let’s see how this baby corners.
Charlie straightens up. -

CHARLIE
Corners?!

SLADE
Say when.
 

101.

CHARLIE
Say when, what?

SLADE
Say when to turn!

CHARLIE
You can’t turn!

SLADE
Where’s the turn? Two o’clock, three
o’clock -- right oblique, right face,
what?! Talk!

CHARLIE
Three o’clock.

SLADE
I knew it! Now?

CHARLIE
No, not now!

The empty intersections fly by.

> SLADE
Now?

CHARLIE
Please, Colonel!

SLADE
I’m getting ready to take a corner.
Here we go -~-

CHARLIE
Okay, okay -- wait-wait-wait -- Now!!

Slade double-clutches very professionally, making a screeching,
terrifying Grand Prix turn.

SLADE
Charlie, you’re riding with a very
happy man.
Charlie, frozen in his seat, cannot speak. And for the moment,
neither can Slade. He seems transported by the situation,
completely open and totally vulnerable.

SLADE (contd)
Oh, I love this. *

Then, in the very next instant, he is all himself again.

SLADE (contd)
Let’s take it to the max.

Slade stands on the accelerator.
 

102.
CHARLIE
Oh, jee-zus.
The car hurtles down the empty warehouse street, the Ferrari
engine deafening, Charlie’s eyes wide with fright, Slade’s teeth
bared in ecstasy.

CHARLIE (contd)
Oh please, oh don’t, oh don’t --

Charlie is desperate, suddenly he hears a SOUND, he can’t
identify it for a moment, it is Slade, screaming, he is .
SCREAMING with delight, his hands clutching the vibrating wheel.
Charlie goes white.

CHARLIE (contd)
Let me out.

The SOUND of a police siren.
SLADE
Shit, the yellow flag. And I hadn’t
even opened her up yet.
Slade, cackling, slows the car.

SLADE (contd)
Where’s the curb?

CHARLIE (contd)
Uh -- uh, one o’clock.

Slade starts easing over.

CHARLIE (contd)
Easy, easy...

The Ferrari bounces off the curb.

BULLHORN (V.0.)

Pull over.

SLADE
Pit stop. We’ll be out of here in
seconds.

A blue-and-white Traffic Division vehicle is right on the
Ferrari’s tail. More BLIPS of a siren.

SLADE (contd) *
I haven’t had a ticket in years.

CHARLIE
Oh my God --

Slade comes to a halt.
 

65

103.

SLADE
I’11 do the talking.

EXT. CURB, WAREHOUSE AREA - DAY 65

Slade cuts the motor, lowers the window, looks right out at
PATROLMAN GORE, 28, an attractive example of New York’s finest.

GORE
License and registration.

Charlie reaches across Slade and hands Gore a document from the
glove compartment.

GORE (contd)
to Slade)
Test-driving this baby?

SLADE
Don’t she purr, though?
GORE
At ninety miles an hour.
SLADE
Wait til you hear her at a hundred and
twenty-five.

Charlie slumps in his seat.

GORE
Where’s your license?

SLADE
At the dealer’s. They give it back
to you when you return the car.
A moment.

GORE
I.D.

Slade reaches in his wallet, hands Gore a plastic card. He
reads it very carefully.

GORE (contd)
Lieutenant-Colonel Slade?

Slade snaps off a sharp salute.

SLADE
And you, soldier?

Charlie groans.

GORE
The name is Patrolman Gore, Colonel.
 

104.

SLADE
What outfit?

GORE
Traffic B.

SLADE
You’re doing a helluva job, Gore.

GORE
And so are you.
(nods at Charlie)
Who’s this?

SLADE
That’s my boy, Charlie. He kept
telling me to let it out, what was I
going to do, disappoint him?

GORE
Yes.

Slade falls silent, so does Gore, who keeps checking the
military I.D., then Slade. Slade has a choirboy’s expression on
his face, as if waiting to receive his punishment.

GORE (contd)
I’m going to let you go Colonel Slade
-- on one condition --

SLADE
What’s that?

GORE
You take this rig straight back to the
dealer. .

CHARLIE
You got it!

SLADE
(to Charlie)
Shut up.

He turns back to Gore.
SLADE (contd)
Your face and your voice are familiar,
Gore. You ever in the Officer’s Club
in Dhanang?
Charlie’s head sinks into his chest.

GORE
No.

SLADE
Never in the Army?
 

66

105.

GORE
Coast Guard.

SLADE '
Good Lord.

Gore contemplates Slade for a moment.

GORE
(to Charlie)
Your Dad’s looking good, Charlie, but
he’s got a heavy foot. Tell him to
lighten up a bit.

SLADE
I hear you.

Gore starts back towards his car.

SLADE (contd)
Gore! If you ever need a letter of
commendation for your 201 File, let
me know. I/11 write the Commandant.

Slade revs up the Ferrari noisily.
CHARLIE
Get out of that seat, you’re not
driving anymore!

SLADE
Just keeping this baby warm.

As the blue-and-white police car drives away, Charlie jumps out

of the Ferrari, runs over to the driver’s side, helps Slade out,
hands him his cane, and Slade taps his way back to the passenger
side.

INT. PARK AVENUE FERRARI DEALERSHIP - DAY 66

Fred is waiting as Charlie pulls in with Slade. Fred checks the
car over, approaches Slade as he is helped out by Charlie.

FRED
I was afraid you guys took a powder
to Passaic.
Slade ignores him.

FRED (contd) .
So?

SLADE
I’m crazy about the car.

FRED
It’s another world, isn’t it?
106.

SLADE
We took her to the max and she sang
like a dream.
FRED
(smiles)
I ought to put you to work here on the
floor, Colonel.

SLADE
There’s only one thing wrong.

Fred looks anxious.

SLADE (contd)
The color.

Fred checks the car, now Charlie.

FRED
The color?

SLADE
I don’t like the color.

Slade is staring blindly right at the 348 ts.

FRED .
You want silver, we’ll give you

silver?
SLADE

No, this is the car I want.
FRED

This car is Ferrari red.

SLADE

\ I don’t like Ferrari red. It reminds
i me of the G-2’s dick, you know what

I mean, Charlie?

CHARLIE
(reluctantly)
Yeah.

SLADE
(to Charlie)
Some other time.

CHARLIE -
(to Fred)
Some other time.

Slade takes Charlie’s arm now, and they calmly stroll out. Fred
watches from the doorway as Charlie gives a piercing

} two-fingered whistle, a cab materializes right out of the rush

, hour traffic, they climb in and disappear down Park Avenue.

 
 

67

107.

INT. TAXICAB, PARK AVENUE - DAY 67

The taxi is stuck in traffic, a classic New York city gridlock.
Slade jerks his head this way and that, tapping his foot
impatiently, but there is no movement on the street, just the
HONKING of horns and the SHOUTS of taxi drivers. Charlie senses
his impatience but Slade, uncharacteristically, says nothing.

He is within himself. His sightless eyes blink agitatedly.

SLADE
This is taking too long.

In an instant he has opened the door and stepped out into the
maelstrom of cars and pedestrians in midtown, his cane flailing,
his antennae taking him with the flow, Charlie throws some money
at the taxi driver, jumps out, but Slade has already strode
away.

CHARLIE
Hey! Colonel! C’mon, Colonel!

The light changes, around Slade the traffic starts moving, but

he continues on through it. SCREECHES of cars braking, cabbies
and drivers yelling, Slade loses his cane but he is impervious

as he hurries along on his forced march, slamming into a trash

can, taking a moment to knock the heavy thing into the street.

Charlie retrieves the cane, catches up. Slade has an odd look

to him, a film of sweat.

CHARLIE (contd)
What the hell are you doing?

SLADE
I’ve got to take a piss.

He starts to undo his fly.

CHARLIE
Colonel, for Chrissake, you’re on Park
Avenue.
SLADE

The perfect place.

They are on the median of the street now, Charlie backs Slade
against the fence, at the same time shields him.

CHARLIE
Button your fly, here comes a cop.
SLADE
I’ve got nothing to hide from the New
York City police.

CHARLIE .
Please, Colonel -- zip it up!
108.

SLADE
Okay, Charlie, okay, don’t get
excited.

Slade has spun around now, zipped _up his fly, he reaches over
the fence, fumbles in the bed of Fall flowers planted in the
median, plucks a huge chrysanthemum.

. SLADE (contd)
Will you be my date for the Navy game,
Charlie?

CHARLIE
Cut that out!

SLADE
(sadly)
‘cut that out.’ Jack Benny used to
say that. I loved Jack Benny. Gimme
your arm, I’m getting tired.

Slade seems to collapse for a moment, all his weight going on
Charlie.

CHARLIE
Promise me, you’1l never do anything
like that again.

SLADE
What’d I do?

CHARLIE
Run out in front of a whole bunch of
cars.

SLADE
What kind?

Charlie hustles Slade through the revolving door of the Waldorf.
| 68 INT. WALDORF LOBBY - DAY 68
Slade and Charlie move up the steps leading to the lobby.

SLADE
Which way’s the men’s room?

CHARLIE
We’ll be upstairs in a minute.

SLADE -
Okay, I’11 use a palm tree.

They are in the lobby, and indeed the fronds of a palm tree are
brushing the Colonel’s face as he again undoes his fly.

CHARLIE
You do that, Colonel, and I’m going
to leave you here.

 
 

109.

SLADE
That’s why they put palm trees in
hotel lobbies, Charlie, to pee in.

CHARLIE
Good-bye.

Charlie releases Slade’s arm and walks away. Slade is
bewildered for a moment, his head turns this way and that.

SLADE
CHARLIE!

People lower their newspapers, a Bellman notices him. Slade
bursts with song:

SLADE (contd)
(sings)

‘I don’t want to walk without you, baby
Walk without my arms about you, baby
I thought the day you left me behind
I’d take a stroll and get you right

off my mind
But now I find that...’

A plainclothes Security Man is closing in on Slade, Charlie is
coming from the other direction, Jaime, a bag in hand, restrains
the Security Man and something stops Charlie as Slade,
beautifully dressed and as presentable as always, delivers the
song to the bustling Waldorf lobby.

SLADE (contd)
(sings)
‘I don’t want to walk without the sunshine
Why’d you have to turn off all that sunshine
Oh, Baby, please come back or you’1l break
my heart for me
‘Cause I don’t want to walk without you
Nosiree’.

A stunned silence in the lobby, Jaime applauds, now someone
else, it isn’t crazy or not crazy, just a polite round of
applause and everybody goes back to their business as Charlie
resignedly approaches Slade.

CHARLIE
Could we go upstairs now?
SLADE
Why not? ~
CHARLIE
You won’t piss until we get to the
room?
SLADE

The feeling’s passed.
 

110.

He takes Charlie’s arm and they proceed to the bank of elevators
amid murmurs of "That was very nice" and "You’ve got a sweet
voice" from the onlookers. They recede into the distance as
Slade marches and counts cadence straight into an elevator whose
door opens.

SLADE (contd)
‘G.I. beans and G.I. gravy
Gee, I wish I joined the Navy
Count off
Three fo’
Count off
One, two, three, fo’!’

Charlie hurries in after him, Slade reaches the back wall of the
elevator, pivots and continues to march in place.

69 INT. WALDORF SUITE/CORRIDOR - DAY 69

As Charlie fumbles with the key, Slade slumps against the wall,
Charlie turns the key and leads Slade inside, the door slamming
behind then.

CHARLIE
Whew.

Slade, standing in the tiny foyer leading to the sitting room,
appears contradictorily quiet.

CHARLIE (contd)
Are you okay?

SLADE
Yeah.

It sounds like a grunt.

CHARLIE

Did you want to go to the toilet?
SLADE

No.
CHARLIE

Don’t you want to go in your room now?

SLADE
No.

Charlie is puzzled by the sudden lack of affect.

CHARLIE
You’re sure you’re okay?

SLADE
I’m fine.

Slade leans against the wall, he seems strangely silent but
intent.
 

111.

CHARLIE
How about some television?

SLADE
Whatever you say.

Charlie turns on the television, flips through channels, little
or no reaction from Slade, Charlie switches it off, checks his
watch.

CHARLIE
I think I’11 make a call.

SLADE
Go ahead.

Slade is fooling with his cane, testing the shape of the back
of a chair. Charlie pokes in his wallet, withdraws a small
address book. He locates a name, picks up the phone, dials.

CHARLIE
Hi, is George there?

An unfamiliar VOICE answers.

GEORGE’S FATHER (V.0.)
Senior or junior?

A pause.

CHARLIE
Junior.

who! his? GEORGE’S FATHER (V.0O.)
o’s this?

CHARLIE
A friend of his from school.

GEORGE’S FATHER (V.0O.)
Well, George isn’t going to be talking
to any of his friends from school
right now.

Charlie glances over at Slade who has been carefully listening
to the conversation.

CHARLIE
Oh?

GEORGE’S FATHER (V.0.)
Good-bye.

The CLICK of a careful hang-up, Charlie slowly puts down the
phone, Slade’s attention is centered on him.

CHARLIE
Are you looking at me?
71

 

112.
SLADE
I’m blind, Charlie.
They stand there in silence, “regarding each other.
SLADE (contd)

I’m going to take a nap. Too much
fresh air.

CHARLIE

Good idea. Let’s get you into bed.
SLADE

No, the couch. I like this couch

here.

He finds the couch, falls on it and closes his eyes.

CHARLIE
You okay, Colonel? Everything all
right?

SLADE

Go down and get me some aspirin.

CHARLIE
Aspirin? You got it.

Charlie goes.

INT. NEWSSTAND/GIFT SHOP, WALDORF - DAY 70
Charlie emerges from the shop, clutching a little brown bag,
catches sight of doors about to close on the facing elevator,

with a jump he just makes it inside.

INT. WALDORF SUITE - LATE AFTERNOON 71
Charlie enters the suite, flipping the bottle of aspirin, but
Slade is no longer on the couch. Charlie hears movement in

Slade’s bedroom, he walks in. Slade is partially dressed in his
dress blues, knotting his tie, fastening his jacket.

He looks great.

CHARLIE
Are we going someplace?

SLADE
Yeah. I’m taking a trip.

CHARLIE
Where are you going?

Slade ignores him, places his medals against his chest, discards
them for the simpler ribbons, Charlie is observing him closely.

CHARLIE (contd)
.-.Colonel?
 

113.

Slade pivots and as he pivots, his .45 becomes visible strapped
to his side, he unholsters it, inserts a magazine, CLICK-CLICK.
Ejects the magazine, CLICK-CLICK, inserts it again. Manically,
Slade loads and unloads the gun, Charlie watching hin.

CLICK-CLICK. CLICK-CLICK.

CHARLIE (contd)
(quietly)
I thought we had a deal.

SLADE
I’m welching. I’m a welcher, didn’t
I tell you?

CHARLIE
What you did tell me was you gave me
all the bullets.

SLADE
You believe everything people tell
you? Don’t you know, Sailor, no
self-respecting officer is without
ammunition for his sidearm --
(touches his hat)
-- either in his hat band --
(clicks a heel)
-- or in his shoe.

CHARLIE
(grim)
You could have fooled me.

SLADE
And I did. How, Charlie, are you
going to survive in this world without
me?

Slade places the barrel of the gun at his own temple.

CHARLIE
Give me that gun.

Slade lowers the pistol, spins it Sammy Davis-style on his index

finger, leaves it hanging. Charlie regards the gun danglin

from Slade’s finger, takes a step towards it. Slade flips it

- again, the handle smacks into his palm and now the gun is
pointing straight at Charlie.

CHARLIE (contd)
What are you doing?

SLADE
I’m going to shoot you, too. Your
life is finished anyway. Your friend
George is going to sing like a canary.
And so will you.

(MORE)
 

114.

SLADE (contd)
And once you’ve sung, Charlie my
boy, you will take your place in
The Long Gray Line of American
Manhood.
(a _ pause)
And you will be through.

CHARLIE
What makes you think I’m going to
sing?

SLADE
The same thing that brought you to The
Baird School from Appleknocker,
Oregon. Ambition. You reek of it.
Striving is the name of your game.
You were on your way up, Charlie, you
were going to sit at the Councils of
the Mighty. But you would have had
to sing before they’d let you pull up

a chair.

CHARLIE
I’d like to disagree with you,
Colonel --

SLADE

You’re not in a position to. I’ve got
a loaded .45 and you’ve got pimples.
I’m going to kill you because I can’t
bear the thought of your selling out --
and don’t worry about death. Lives

are not measured by their length.
You've stuffed a lot into 17 years,
Charlie, gobs more than I have in 49.

CHARLIE
Put that gun down, Colonel.
SLADE
You giving me ultimatums? I give the
ultimatums.
CHARLIE
Sorry.
SLADE

That’s all right. I stood up to
everybody and everything because it
made me feel important. You stand up
because you mean it. You know,
Charlie, I don’t know whether to shoot
you or adopt you.

CHARLIE
Not much of a choice, sir.

SLADE
Don’t get cute with me.
 

115.

He cocks his gun again. CLICK-CLICK.

CHARLIE
Colonel, please -- Colonel, put it
away.

SLADE

Godammit, I asked you a question! Do
you want me to adopt you or don’t
you?!

Charlie is speechless.

SLADE (contd)
You know, the spouse or unmarried
child of those having at least twenty
years of active service are also
entitled to burial at Arlington?

CHARLIE
Could we get off suicide? You’re just
in a slump right now.

SLADE
No slump, Charlie. I’m bad. Not bad,
rotten.

CHARLIE

You’re not bad, you’re just in pain.

SLADE
What the fuck do you know about pain?
You're a fucking little snail darter
from the Pacific Northwest.

Slade reaches for a cigar one-handed, lights it with his Zippo,
blows a smoke ring, aims the gun at the smoke ring, Charlie
steps towards him and Slade lowers the gun again and points it
right at Charlie.

SLADE (contd)
This is no time to grow a dick, ny
joy.

CHARLIE
Please put the gun away, Colonel...

Charlie takes one more step towards Slade. Slade hesitates,
twirls the gun furiously, and suddenly it is pointing at his own
head again.

SLADE
Don’t move. .

Charlie freezes.
 

116.

SLADE (contd)
I’m talking Parade Ground --
(shouts)
-- Atten-shun!!

Charlie is motionless, sweat at his hairline as Slade’s antennae
work overtime, the place static with the electricity of his
concentration. Charlie advances on Slade, who keeps the pistol
trained on his own temple.

SLADE (contd)
Soldier, you were given an order.

CHARLIE
Give me the gun, Colonel.

SLADE
Charlie, in five seconds I’m going to
kill myself.

CHARLIE
I want your gun, Colonel.
SLADE
Five -- four -- three -- two --

WHAP! Charlie, ducking under the electrical field and quick as
a cat, grabs the barrel of the gun, tries to wrest it away, but
the Colonel won’t give it up. They struggle, Charlie holds on
desperately, pulling the gun down towards himself but Slade
won’t release it. The barrel of the gun is now pointed at
Charlie’s stomach, he has both his hands around it, but the

Colonel’s finger is still firmly on the trigger.

SLADE (contd)
Let go.

CHARLIE
No, I won’t.

SLADE
You’re going to die like a dog,
Charlie.

CHARLIE
Do it! You want to do it? Do it!
Do it!

Only the sounds of their breathing now.
CHARLIE (contd) ~
I’ll explode all over you. Pull the
thing, you blind motherfucker.

Charlie starts to hyperventilate, his breaths coming in terrible
heaves, sweat running down his cheek. Slade is inches away.

SLADE
You smell.
117.

j CHARLIE
I’m scared.
SLADE
You don’t want to die, Charlie.
. CHARLIE
Neither do you.
SLADE
Give me one reason not to.
CHARLIE

I’ll give you two. You can dance a
tango and drive a Ferrari better than
anybody I’ve ever seen.

SLADE
You’ve never seen anybody do either.

He stares down at his gun.

SLADE (contd)
(noodling gently)
*pid you ever have the feeling that
you wanted to go
Still have the feeling that you
wanted to stay...’

! CHARLIE
i Please, Colonel, give it to me.

A moment.

SLADE
You know how to handle a .45?

Another moment.

CHARLIE
Half as good as a .90.

Slade hesitates for a moment, he manages a weak smile, relaxes
imperceptibly. Charlie looks down, finds Slade has released the
gun, Charlie holds it awkwardly by the barrel. Slade gently
reaches out, with one hand he flicks a lever, the magazine drops
out of the gun, with the other hand Slade catches it’and in one
smooth move, reaches up and deposits it in Charlie’s breast
pocket. Now Slade turns away.

SLADE .
I could use a drink.

CHARLIE
How about a cup of coffee?

SLADE .
i That’s too big a leap for me right
now, Charlie. Maybe tomorrow. Mr.

John Daniels, no water.

 
118.

Charlie crosses to the mini-bar, and Slade listens to the
comfortable sounds of Charlie fixing him a drink. Charlie hands
the glass to him. Slade takes a gulp, makes a face.

SLADE (contd)
I said no water, Charlie.

CHARLIE
No water. They have strong ice at the
Waldorf.

Slade smiles, takes another sip.

The RATTLE of a key in the door, the Night Maid,-an aging but
attractive Hispanic woman, enters.

NIGHT MAID
Turn down your bed, sir?

CHARLIE
No, thank you --

Slade sniffs the air, opens his arms invitingly.

SLADE
What he means, senorita, is come right
in.
| The Night Maid smiles anxiously. Charlie removes a set of
towels from her arm, shows her out.

CHARLIE
(kindly)
Maybe later.

NIGHT MAID
Yes sir, good night.

She leaves, Slade is still sniffing the area, his teeth bared
in a ravenous smile.

CHARLIE
Boy, have you got a one-track mind.
SLADE
Is there anything else in the world,
Charlie?
CHARLIE
Not for you. x
SLADE

What’s so bad? Women are the essence
of life. You know what’s kept me
going all these years --

(MORE)

 
 

119.

SLADE (contd)
(hesitates)
...The thought that maybe one day I
could have a woman’s arms wrapped

around me -- and her legs -- wrapped
around me -- and --

CHARLIE
And what?

SLADE
And that she might still be there in
the morning when I wake up -- the
smell of her, all funky and warn...

Slade is staring blindly into the remains of his watery drink,
Charlie watching him closely, Slade oddly drifts away.

SLADE (contd)
I finally gave up on it.

CHARLIE
Well, you’re making a mistake. I
don’t know why you can’t have that.

SLADE
(dazedly)
Have what?
CHARLIE

You know, when we get back to New
Hampshire, I don’t know why you can’t
find someone. You’re a good-looking
guy...you’re a lot of fun...great to
travel with...sensitive...
compassionate --

Slade smiles.

SLADE
Are you fucking with me, Charlie?

CHARLIE
Yes.

. Slade laughs. The telephone RINGS.

CHARLIE (contd)
(to Slade)
You know, from now on you don’t have *
to decide to kill yourself to come to
New York and have a good time.

Charlie picks up the RINGING telephone.
 

72

120.

CHARLIE (contd)
(into phone)
Hold on.
(to Slade)
Do you?

A long moment.

SLADE
No.

CHARLIE

(phone)
Yeah? Oh hi, Manny...The plane? What
time does it leave? --

(checks his watch)
Oh my God!

(to Slade)
We missed our plane!

SLADE
Your plane, Charlie, my ticket was
one-way.

Charlie holds up his hand to Slade.

CHARLIE
That's okay, Manny says there’re
shuttles on the hour till 9 o’clock.

Slade ignores Charlie, rubs his sleeve on the patent leather
visor of his dress hat, fits it to his head. He looks
impressive.

SLADE

No way, Charlie. Not the shuttle, not

at any price.
EXT. WALDORF-ASTORIA - NIGHT 72
The limo is at the curb, Jaime adjusts Slade’s bag in the trunk,
slams the lid shut, hurries around to hold the door for Slade.
Slade slaps him fondly on the arm.

SLADE
Hyman, I like the cut of your jib.

He hands him some money.

JAIME -
Thank you, sir.

SLADE
Nada.

Slade steps into the car, Charlie following after, Jaime salutes
the limo as Manny drives away.

INT. LIMO - NIGHT 73
Manny picks up the phone.
MANNY
New England Turnpike all the way,
Colonel?

SLADE
Open ‘er up, Manolo.

Slade stretches out his legs.
EXT. NEW ENGLAND TURNPIKE - NIGHT 74

The limo catching the reflection of iron oxide tollbooth lights
as the car enters Westchester.

INT. LIMO - NIGHT 75
Slade takes out his flask, tries to drink, but it is empty.

Charlie passes him the remains of a bottle of water, Slade

drains it.

Charlie peers moodily out the window, Slade’s head tilts towards
hin.

SLADE
I’m getting that heavy feeling again,
Charlie.

CHARLIE
Um --

(a moment)

Ahh --

SLADE
One um -- one ahh --

CHARLIE

uUm...I think you were right about
George and his father.

Another moment.

SLADE
I’m sorry to hear that.

CHARLIE
As soon as we get back, Dean Trask is *
bringing us up in front of the whole
school --

SLADE
Putting your feet to the fire?

CHARLIE og
A special meeting of the Disciplinary
Committee.
77

 

76°

122.

SLADE
And you say what?

CHARLIE
Ill think of something.

Slade tries to get a last sip out of his flask. Charlie hands
him a fresh bottle of water.

SLADE
Thanks. Why are you all alone with
this? Where’s your father?

CHARLIE
He left.

SLADE
I thought it was a Mom-and-Pop store.
Who’s the Pop?

CHARLIE
My stepfather.

SLADE
Oh yeah. Why isn’t he in on this?

Charlie doesn’t answer.

SLADE (contd)
He’s no good, huh?

CHARLIE

He’s okay. We just don’t get along.
SLADE

Why not?
CHARLIE

Because he’s an asshole.

SLADE
That’s all right. Every family’s got
one nowadays.

They drift into silence.
EXT. LIMO, NEW ENGLAND TURNPIKE - NIGHT 76

The limo drives on, passing noisy semis and lonely night-hound
cars. .

INT. LIMO - NIGHT : 77

Slade and Charlie are both asleep, a blanket covering them.
Slade wakes up, picks up the phone.

SLADE

(quietly)
Where are we?
 

78

123.

MANNY

Worcester.
SLADE
(whispers)

Keep rolling, Manny.

Charlie, asleep, shivers. Slade takes the blanket off himself
and doubles it up on Charlie, now he settles himself
ramrod-straight in the corner of the backseat, his dress hat
rests on his knee, his eyes are closed, but an acute sense of
awareness about him, as if he could bounce awake in an instant.
As if he were in a foxhole.

EXT. DORMITORY, THE BAIRD SCHOOL - MORNING 78

A screen door keeps slamming as students pour out of the
building, green book bags and bicycles, they make their way down
gravel paths to the Academy Building in the distance.

The limousine pulls up and parks, a few of the students glance
at the tinted windows of the car as they pass. The limo door
opens, Manny hands Charlie a plastic Waldorf-Astoria laundry
bag.

MANNY
-.-This it?

CHARLIE
Thanks.

He takes the bag, climbs out of the limo, turns back to Slade
who is still seated in the car, his head tilted towards Charlie.
A bell RINGS.

SLADE
What’s that?

CHARLIE
First bell. I just got time to shave.

Slade extends a cigarette-sized roll of bills.

SLADE
Three hundred dollars. A job well
done. If you ever need references,
Charlie, I’m your man.

Charlie takes the money.

CHARLIE
Thank you.
(to Manny)
It’s 16 Water Street. Just over the
bridge and --

SLADE
We’ll find it.
79

80

 

124.

He holds out his hand.

SLADE (contd)
Good-bye, Charlie.

CHARLIE
Good-bye, Colonel.

They shake. Silence.

SLADE
Okay, Manny.

Manny squeezes Charlie’s shoulder, Charlie ties the knot of the
laundry bag tighter, then runs into his dormitory, dodging other
students as they come out.

EXT. THE BAIRD SCHOOL, BELFRY - MORNING 79
The bell RINGS again.
INT. ACADEMY BUILDING, BAIRD SCHOOL - MORNING 80

An impressive assembly hall, portraits of founders and former
headmasters line the walls, the entire student body is settling
into long benches, century-old relics with initials of alumni
long dead carved into the backs. The benches face a stage and
a podium.

Charlie enters, the bell is RINGING steadily now, a Monitor
touches Charlie’s arm, motions him up the steps to the stage
where the members of the Student-Faculty Disciplinary Committee
are taking seats in wooden armchairs arranged in a semi-circle.
Facing the Committee are a pair of elementary school-type desks.

Charlie notices George at one of the desks, but he is depressed
to see a distinguished-looking, gray-haired man seated beside
him, GEORGE WILLIS, SR. George, Jr., who appears to have shrunk
in size next to his father, studiously avoids meeting Charlie’s
glance as Charlie takes his seat at the other desk. Mrs.
Hunsaker is beside the podium with a note pad. A noisy rustle
and scraping of benches, the students rising as Dean Trask
enters from a wing.

Charlie, isolated at his desk, looks out, his eyes rove the sea
of students’ faces in the great hall. Seated in their midst,
and side-by-side, are Harry, Trent and Jimmy. The bell stops
ringing as the last tardy students take their seats. Trask
approaches the podium.

TRASK .
..-I called an open meeting of this
institution this morning because the
incident that occurred this Tuesday
last, describes an issue that concerns
all of us...not an isolated case of

(MORE)
 

125.

TRASK (contd)
vandalism, what happened is the
symptom of the sickness of a society,
a sickness which runs counter to the
principles this school was founded on.
A school among whose graduates, three
have sat at the desk in the Oval Room
of The White House. Baird men have
run State Departments and investment
houses, founded department stores and
coached football teams, our alumni
receive their bulletins in ashrams in
India and in palaces in Jordan, we
are, in fact, known around the world
as the cradle of this country’s
leadership. But today we are bleeding
from disrespect.

A door to the assembly hall SQUEAKS open and Manny, caught like
a rabbit in headlights, appears. Awkwardly, he leads Slade onto
the stage and into a chair next to a startled Charlie. Slade
settles himself in as if he were right at home, Manny departs
quickly as Trask looks Slade up and down, as do the other
participants on the stage. The students on the back benches
rise, to get a better view of this blind article who has
arranged himself at the side of Charlie Simms.

Slade leans over to a bewildered Charlie, speaks intently to
him, now Charlie turns Slade in the direction of George’s
father, Slade tilts his head in his fashion, examining George,
Sr. with his antennae, but George, Sr. meets his gaze.

TRASK (contd)
Who is this, Mr. Simms?

CHARLIE
Ummm -- ahh --
SLADE
(to Trask)

‘This’ is Frank Slade,
Lieutenant-Colonel, United States
Army, retired. I’m here in place of
Charlie’s parents.

TRASK
Excuse me?
SLADE
In loco parentis. ~

 

Trask blinks.

SLADE (contd)
They could not make the trip from
Oregon today.
126.

TRASK
And what is your relationship to Mr.
Simms?

SLADE
Is this a courtroom?

TRASK
The closest thing we could manage to
it.

SLADE

Then if we’re taking oaths, I’d like
to swear a few people in.

Silence.
TRASK
There are no oaths at Baird, we are
all on our honor.
SLADE
Larry and Franny Simms are old and
dear friends of mine. They asked me
to appear here today on Charlie’s
behalf. Okay?
A moment.

TRASK
Happy to have you with us, Colonel.

Trask turns towards the desk where George and his father are
seated.

TRASK (contd)
Mr. Willis?

WILLIS, SR.
Which Mr. Willis?

Slade pokes Charlie with his elbow.

TRASK
George, Jr., sir.
GEORGE
Yes?
TRASK -

You were in a position last Tuesday
night to see who vandalized my car.
Who was it?

GEORGE .
Well, I have an idea who it was.
127.

TRASK
Not an ‘idea’, Mr. Willis, did you see
or did you not see?

. GEORGE
I didn’t have my glasses on.

George’s father stares at hin.

GEORGE (contd)

(quickly)
I was in the library, I had on my
reading glasses, and then I helped
Simms close up and I started to put
on my regular glasses but it was a
real frosty night, right? So I
started to clean them, then I heard
this sound, but I never got a chance
to put them on.

TRASK
Whom, with your limited vision, did
you see?

George hesitates, his father puts his hand on his arm, whispers
purposefully to hin.

GEORGE
} (to Trask)
Well, like I say, it was real blurry
-- I mean I can’t see without my

: glasses --
TRASK
What did you see, Mr. Willis?
| GEORGE

You mean definitively?

TRASK
Stop fencing with me, Mr. Willis, and
tell me what you saw!

George’s father drills George with another stare.

GEORGE
Now don’t hold me to this, but -- I
mean no glasses, and it was dark and
everything and --

TRASK
Mr. Willis?!

GEORGE
Maybe Harry Havemeyer, Trent Potter
and Jimmy Jameson.

TRASK
‘Maybe’?

 
 

128.
GEORGE
Ballpark. Best guess.
TRASK
Could you provide us with some detail?
GEORGE
Well, Charlie could tell you for sure,
he was closer.

Trask, finally, irritated by the interchange, turns to Charlie.

TRASK
Mr. Simms?
CHARLIE
Yes?
TRASK
You don’t wear eyeglasses, do you?
CHARLIE
No.
TRASK
With your untrammeled sight, whom did
you see?

A moment. From their seats in the middle of the assembly,
Harry, Trent and Jimmy, very nervous now, await Charlie’s
response.

CHARLIE (contd)
I saw something, but I couldn’t say
who it was.

TRASK
All right, what was the ‘something’
you saw?
CHARLIE
I couldn’t say.
TRASK
You ‘couldn’t say’? Or you wouldn’t
say?
CHARLIE
I -- I just couldn’t say. .
TRASK

Couldn't, wouldn’t, shouldn’t! Mr.
Simms, you’re exhausting my patience
and making a mockery of these
proceedings. I am giving you one last
j chance -- the consequences of your
response will be dire.
(MORE)
 

129.

TRASK (contd)
By ‘dire,’ Mr. Simms, I mean your
future will be jeopardized --
ermanently. Now, for the last
Pine -- what did you see last
Tuesday night outside my house?

CHARLIE
I saw somebody --

TRASK
(interrupting)
‘I saw somebody.’ Good! And did you
see their size and shape?

CHARLIE
Yes, sir.

TRASK
And they were the size and shape of
whom?

CHARLIE

They were the size and shape of --
A very long moment.

CHARLIE (contd)
..-most any Baird student.

Slade is ecstatic. Harry, Trent and Jimmy sink back into their
seats and exhale with relief.

Trask surveys the gathering: the student body. the Disciplinary
Committee, George, Jr. and George, Sr., and finally, Charlie and

Slade.
TRASK
I am left with no real witness. Mr.
Willis’ testimony is not only vague,
it is unsubstantiated. The substance
I was looking for, Mr. Simms, was to
come from you.
CHARLIE
I’m sorry.
Silence.

CHARLIE (contd)
I really am.

TRASK
I’m sorry, too. Because you know what
I’m going to do inasmuch as I can’t
punish Mr. Havemeyer, Mr. Potter and
Mr. Jameson -- and I won’t punish
(MORE)

 
Silence.

130.

TRASK (Cont’d)
Mr. Willis, he is the only party to
this incident who is still worthy of
calling himself~a Baird man -- I am
going to expel you, Mr. Simms. You
are a cover-up artist and you are a

liar.
SLADE
But not a snitch.
TRASK
Excuse me?
SLADE
No, I don’t think I will.
TRASK
Mr. Slade --
SLADE

TRASK
Please watch your language, Mr. Slade,
you are in The Baird School, not a
barracks. Mr. Simms, I’1ll give you
one final opportunity to speak up --

SLADE
Mr. Simms doesn’t want it. He doesn’t
need to be labeled ‘still worthy of
being a Baird man’. What’s your motto
here? "Boys, inform on your
classmates and you’1l save your hide,
anything short of that and we’ll burn
you at the stake"? Gentlemen, when
the shit hits the fan, some guys run
and some guys stay. Here’s Charlie
-- facing the fire. And there’s
George -- hiding in Big Daddy’s
pocket. And what are you going to do,
Dean Trask? Reward George -- and
destroy Charlie?

TRASK
Are you finished, Mr.Slade?

- SLADE
I’m just warming up. I don’t care if
William Howard Taft or William
Jennings Bryan went here, their spirit

is dead.
(MORE)
131.

SLADE (contd)
You’re building a ratship, a vessel for
seagoing snitches, and if you think
you're preparing these minnows for
manhood, think again because you’re
killing the very spirit this institution
proclaims it instills. What a
performance. The only class in the
act is sitting next to me and I’m here
to tell you his soul is intact. You
know why? Because someone, I’m not
going to say who, offered to buy it.

Slade stares at Trask.

SLADE (contd)
However, Charlie wasn’t selling.

TRASK
Sir, you’re out of order.

SLADE
You don’t know what ‘out of order’ is.
I’d show you out of order, but I’m too
old, too tired and too blind. If I
were the man I was five years ago, I’d
put a flame thrower to this place.
I’ve been around, Dean-O, there was
a time when I could see, and I’ve seen
arms torn out and legs ripped off but
there’s nothing like the sight of an
amputated spirit -- no prosthetic for
that. You think you’re merely sending
this splendid foot soldier back to
Oregon with his tail between his legs.
But I say you’re executing his soul.
And on what rap -- that he’s not a
Baird man?

Slade surveys the hall. Harry, Trent and Jimmy are all
attention, enjoying the drift of Slade’s words.

SLADE (contd)
Baird men? You’ll be Baird bums. The
whole bunch of you. And Harry, Trent
and Jimmy, wherever you are out there,
fuck you too.

Harry, Trent and Jimmy go white. A rustle around them, even a
few suppressed laughs. .
TRASK

Stand down, Mr. Slade.

SLADE
I’m not finished. As I came in, I
heard the words ‘cradle of
leadership’. Well, when the bough
breaks, the cradle will fall. And
it’s fallen here.
 

132.

Slade turns to the members of the Disciplinary Committee.

SLADE (contd)
Makers of men, creators of leaders,
be careful what kind of leaders you’re
producing here. Which youth do you
think the young Tom Jefferson was
like? Which young man do you think
young Abraham Lincoln resembled? Who
here takes after George Patton?

He tilts his head towards George.

SLADE (contd)
This creep...

He turns towards Charlie.

SLADE (contd)
Or Charlie?

Slade turns towards his chair.

SLADE (contd)
I’ve come to crossroads in my life.
I always knew what the right path was.
But I never took it because it was too
hard. Charlie’s come to a crossroads.
And he’s chosen the right path. The
path is made of Principle and it leads
to Character. Let him continue on his
journey.

He sits. The hall is engulfed in silence.

The SOUND of a hand clap from a back bench, two other hand claps
and now rhythmic applause starts, Trask is banging on a gavel
but no one will listen, Mrs. Hunsaker is trying to quiet Trask
down, George Willis, Sr. turns beet-red, Harry, Trent and Jimmy
don’t know which way to turn, the members of the Student-Faculty
Disciplinary Committee have already begun conferring, the
CLAPPING builds and envelops the place, the old red brick
building seems to shake with SOUND, Slade reaches down and
squeezes Charlie’s arm, a wink from his gimpy eye.

SLADE (contd)
(to Charlie)
How’s that for cornball?

Trask BANGS his gavel insistently, now he stands up on the stage
and crisscrosses his arms desperately, finally a reluctant
SILENCE.

TRASK
We will adjourn and the Disciplinary
Committee will take this matter under
advisement -- in camera -- in closed
session --
133.

A BUZZ, the Student-Faculty Disciplinary Committee members who
are still huddled, break from it. A Senior faculty member
hurries over to Trask, speaks to him. Trask reacts angrily, the
faculty member holds his ground, Trask stalks off in a huff, the
faculty member then hands a piece of paper to Mrs. Hunsaker.

MRS. HUNSAKER

(reading)
The joint Student-Faculty Disciplinary
Committee need no further sessions,
they have come to a decision. Messrs.
Havemeyer, Potter and Jameson are
placed on probation for suspicion of
ungentlemanly conduct -- It is further
recommended that Mr. George Willis,
Jr. receive neither recognition, nor
commendation, for his cooperation --

George, Sr. gets up and walks out.

MRS. HUNSAKER (contd)
Mr. Charles Simms is excused from any
further response to this incident.

The place erupts, RHYTHMIC APPLAUSE again, the back-benchers
climbing on each others’ shoulders to get a better view of
Slade and Charlie.

SLADE
(to Charlie)
We better get off before they give us
the hook.

Slade takes Charlie’s arm, Charlie leads him out, Slade sniffing
as he goes:

SLADE (contd)
(to Charlie, over the
NOISE)
No ginch, not a trace of a scent.
When is this school going to enter the
20th Century?

CHARLIE
Where did you get that ‘Larry and
Franny’ stuff? Those aren’t my
parents’ names.

SLADE
Sound good, don’t they? ‘
CHARLIE
Yeah. And thanks.
SLADE
For what?
CHARLIE

For you know what.
 

134.

SLADE
Hey, I was just protecting myself.
What’s going to happen to all of us
if George and Harry are running the
country in twenty years?

There is a hubbub around Charlie and Slade as Charlie leads him
out, students calling to Slade, "Thank you, sir", "Good going,

sir", "Hey,

your friend’s great, Charlie", but still they give

the blind Slade a wide berth as he taps his cane in a broad arc.
Emerging from the crowd, CHRISTINE DOWNES, 30-ish, a teacher
whom we have seen sitting with the faculty, calls out.

Slade stops,

CHRISTINE
Colonel!

sniffs.

SLADE
Did I speak too soon?
(sniffs again; to
Charlie)
Ginch, after all.

CHRISTINE
I’m Christine Downes, Colonel Slade,
I teach Political Science. I just
wanted to tell you how much I
appreciate your coming here and
speaking your- mind.

SLADE

Why, thank you, are you married?
CHRISTINE

Uh -- uh, I -- uh --
SLADE

Went to Artillery School at Fort Sill
with a Mickey Downes. Thought he
might have snagged you.

Charlie smiles.

CHRISTINE
No -- no -~ I’m afraid not --
CHARLIE
(quickly)

Colonel Slade was on Lyndon Johnson’s .
staff, Miss Downes.

CHRISTINE
Were you? Fascinating.

SLADE
---Let’s get together and talk
politics sometime.

SLADE (contd)
(sniffs)
Fleurs de Rocailles?

Christine is startled.

CHRISTINE
Yes.

SLADE
Flowers from a brook.

Christine, charmed, is taken with Slade.

CHRISTINE
That’s right.

SLADE
Well, Miss Downes, I’1l know where to
find you.
(a moment)
Charlie?

Charlie offers Slade his arm, Slade takes it, and Charlie steers
him through the doors and out to the street as Christine watches
them go.

EXT. LIMO - DAY 81

The car makes its way down the street, into town and across a
bridge.

INT. LIMO, WILTON - DAY 82
Charlie and Slade are side-by-side in the back seat again, Slade
is within himself, not depressed or exhilarated, almost relaxed.
SLADE

+--I think I’1l take my brother to the

Super Bowl next year.
Charlie smiles.
EXT./INT. LIMO, ROSSI HOUSE - DAY 83

The limo pulls up outside 16 Water Street, the distant SOUND of
Francine and Willie playing, Donny’s truck is in the driveway.

Slade lowers his window, breathes in the smell of the place.

SLADE
(to Charlie)
Yaba daba doo.

Manny rolls down the window between driver and passengers, he
has prepared three drinks from a half-pint bottle of Jack
Daniels, a fingerful in each glass, hands one to Slade, one to
Charlie, takes one himself.

MANNY
This one’s on me, Colonel.
 

- 136.

Slade nods his thanks to Manny and now Slade turns to Charlie,

raises the whiskey glass to his glass eye and strikes it gently.

PING.

SLADE
Here’s looking at you.

They drain their drinks.

Manny hops out, retrieves Slade’s bag from the trunk, hands it
to Charlie who has helped Slade out, Slade peels off a few .
hundreds, hands them to Manny who mutters great gratitude, and
Slade gives Manny a good-bye squeeze on the shoulder.

Charlie picks up Slade’s bag, holds out his arm for Slade.

SLADE (contd)
No thanks, Charlie, I’1l take it from
here. You go ahead, Manny will drop
you off at your dorm. Come by before
you go home for Christmas, we’ll have
a little cheer. And if you feel like
it, you’ll stay for dinner. Sometimes
she cooks pot roast -- it’s almost
edible.

CHARLIE
Gee, that would be --

SLADE
Good-bye, Charlie.

Slade takes his bag from Charlie, heads up towards the house by
himself, Charlie climbs back in the limo, watches as Francine
appears around a corner of the house on her tricycle, Willie
riding behind her on the rear running-board. Francine brakes
sharply at the sight of Slade.

. SLADE (contd)
What are you doing?

FRANCINE
Taking a ride.
SLADE
On the trike?
WILLIE
Me, too! -
SLADE
(to Francine)
Get off.
FRANCINE

I will not!
 

 

 

 

 

137.

SLADE
Get off, Francine, or I’11 whack you
with this cane.

Francine gets off, Slade drops his bag.

SLADE (contd)
Give me your hand.

Francine hesitates.

SLADE (contd)
Your hand!

Francine gives him her hand, with his other he feels for the
handlebars of the tricycle, now he hits it with his cane, Willie
jumps off in terror, Francine backs away. Slade drops the cane
as he locat.s the handlebars, now he climbs gingerly on the
seat, all bow-legged and awkward. He is half-on -- half-off.

SLADE (contd)
C’mere, Francie.

She moves to him cautiously, when she reaches him, he lifts her
on to his lap, now he starts pedalling, very slowly.

' WILLIE
Hey!

 

Slade stops, Willie climbs on the back, holds on to Slade by
grabbing his belt. Now Slade picks up the pace. Karen appears
at the kitchen window, Donny beside her, they watch, dumbstruck,
the proceedings outside.

Charlie observes from the back seat of the limo, Manny is about
to pull away.

CHARLIE
Wait.

 

Charlie peers out the limo window at Slade running sprints on

‘the tricycle, Francine and Willie hanging all over him, Karen

and Donny, in thrall, at the kitchen window.

A smile spreads over Charlie’s face. GO OUT on the smile.

THE END
