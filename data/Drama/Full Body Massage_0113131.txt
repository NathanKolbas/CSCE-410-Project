EXT. PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY — HIGH ANGLE — DAY

2

A God's-eye view of a long, winding stream of traffic,
curling along the coastline, wrapping itself around the
Santa Monica Mountains, flowing north to who can say where.
Somewhere in the middle of it all, little more than a
droplet in the stream, is a CADILLAC ALLANTE CONVERTIBLE
with its top down.

As the California sun beats brilliantly down, as the rush
of wind eddies and swirls inside the car, we take our place
directly behind the driver.
From here,

there is little to be learned about the driver
the obvious fact that she is a woman. For a
see nothing of the world other than her windbillowing and curling. And so the mystery of
and why we are traveling with her only deepens.

Then, abruptly, VARIOUS CUTS of her hands on the wheel, of
the speedometer, of her hand on the stickshift, etc.
Occasionally, we sweep up to the mountains or down to the
ocean or past the fence of some tony piece of real estate
overlooking the water. But, always, we return to our point
of departure — behind the driver speeding up the Pacific
Coast Highway.

The Cadillac Allante rolls silently toward us before
turning into a driveway that leads up the hill to a
contemporary house.

EXT. CONTEMPORARY HOUSE — DAY

Pitched on a rolling hillside more evocative of Provence
than Malibu is the dramatic, sharply angular two-story with
its eclectic exterior mix of corrugated walls and mirrored
glass.
As Allante approaches on the driveway, we begin to sense
something slightly askew about this house and this place,
and not all of it has to do with architecture.

The driver's door opens and out swivels NINA: 38 years old,
bright, attractive. But more than merely intelligent, she
is shrewd; more than simply beautiful, she is alluring.
And, perhaps, more to the point, she is shy about neither.
So one senses power as she rises out of the car, just as
one senses insight as she takes a long, penetrating look
around, just as one sees poise and grace as she glides
toward the house.

from the car ... up the walkway ... up to the front door

INT. CONTEMPORARY HOUSE — DAY

From the dramatic slope of the roof to the exposed rafters
to the open, loft-like rooms seemingly suspended in space,
this house has been designed with an eclectic vengeance.
Tasteful, mind you. But nonetheless a conspicuous scheme,
a captivating diversion for the restless eye.

All this has long ago ceased to impress Nina, who
immediately ducks inside the BEDROOM to her right and slips
off her shoes before continuing barefoot down the HALLWAY.
The day's mail awaits her, stacked tidily on a chest midway
down the hall. Taking the mail in hand, she begins sorting
through it even as she ascends the short staircase to the
MAIN ENTERTAINING AREA of the house.
There she stands, in the middle of the floor, absorbed in
some letter or other, when footsteps come quickly down a
staircase and DEE DEE appears.
Dee Dee, a very young, very eager, very uncertain 24-yearold, lets out a slightly startled gasp at the sight of
Nina, who looks up coolly from her letter.
DEE DEE
(painfully self-conscious,
perhaps with a frantic
glance at her watch)
You're home?
(suddenly talking to
herself)
Great, Dee'D.
(just as suddenly talking
to Nina again)
I mean, there you are, standing right
in front of me.
NINA
(doing nothing to put her
at ease)
Hello, Dee Dee.
DEE DEE
Hi, Nina.
A few tentative steps forward.
DEE DEE
How was your day?
NINA
Very pleasant — in a grim sort of
way.
As Nina returns to her letter, Dee Dee moves quickly into
the kitchen.

From a bucket of ice, Dee Dee removes a chilling bottle of

Dee Dee now appears with a glass of wine, which Nina takes
from her. With the wine glass in one hand and her mail in
the other, Nina sprawls leisurely on a sofa.
NINA
And how were things around here?
But before Dee Dee can utter even syllable, Nina cuts her
off.
NINA
Oh, did that what's-his-name, the
strange bald lawyer call?
DEE DEE
No.
NINA
How about Douglas — did he reconfirm
for this afternoon?
DEE DEE
No, no one called.
NINA
If he ever does call me here, it's
fine to give the number for the car —
the lawyer. He represents Merkey,
the artist I'm showing next month.
Douglas already has
the number. Which must mean he's
still coming — if he didn't call.
DEE DEE
(not knowing if this
requires a response)
Well, yeah.
Nina looks up: nothing like a response was either expected
or desired.

The gardener came.
NINA
And how is Mr. Li?
DEE DEE
He cleared out that underbrush, where
you asked about.
NINA
Good.
DEE DEE
Did the deep-root fertilization, too.
Dee Dee hovers a little too near the sofa, prompting Nina
to gaze up at her expectantly.
DEE DEE
I paid all the bills, the checks are
on your desk, you just have to sign
them. And I bought some haddock from
the fishman this morning, I made a
curry sauce to go with it, all you
have to do is pop it in the oven, I
left the directions.
NINA
And you'd like to go home now.
Dee Dee nods sheepishly.
NINA
Go.
Dee Dee crosses slowly to the staircase.

for three weeks. He has to go to

NINA
No doubt.
DEE DEE
He wanted to know if you wanted his
nephew to come the next two weeks.
NINA
And you told him yes, I hope.
Dee Dee nods.
NINA
You're a good little wife, Dee Dee.
Every woman should have one.

Taking this as a compliment, she smiles and disappears.
After a moment, the front door opens and closes. After a
moment more, Nina rises with wine glass in hand and goes to
the BACK DOOR. She gazes pensively through the glass,
perhaps watching Dee Dee go, perhaps not.

Nina slips a CD into the compact disc player, and we hear

in G-Minor.

Standing in front of a full-length mirror, Nina takes a
moment to study herself in her suit, her uniform, if you
will.

CONTINUED:

After a moment, after drinking off a little too much wine
for one sip, she puts the glass to one side. Then, without
taking her eyes off herself, she begins removing her
clothes.
It is a slow and sultry dance, and her eyes, rapt
hypnotically, never leave the mirror as she slides out of
her skirt ... her blouse ... her nylons ... her bra....
Only gradually does it occur to us that there may be
something other than prurience at stake here. This strip
is not a tease but a conscious peeling away of layer upon
layer of her well-ordered, well-practiced life. If she
stares, it's only because she is making certain that
absolutely nothing of her accustomed life is left.
Once all her clothes are off, she takes another moment to
study herself. Then, after retrieving a robe from an
adjoining bathroom, she starts into the hallway.
CUT TO:

EXT. HOUSE — JACUZZI — DAY

She tests the steaming, bubbling water with the graze of a
foot. Then, dropping her robe, she eases her body down,
penetrating the water until she is submerged to the neck.
Allowing her head to fall gently back, she gazes heavenward
at the starry night. She is drifting now; her mind is
soaring across space and time.

So far adrift is Nina that it takes her a moment to realize
that the car is pulling up the driveway. But when she
finally does see the car, she inches forward curiously.
As she watches the car disappear around the front of the
house, she reaches for her robe and climbs out of the
jacuzzi.

EXT. DRIVEWAY — DAY

As he slides out from behind the wheel and unbends himself
onto the driveway, we get our first clear look at FITCH.
At 44, he seems to be in equal parts showing his age and
hiding it. Yes, his face is deeply lined. Yes, he is as
grey as he is not. Yet, at the same time, he is as lean
and agile as he was 20 years earlier.
With hair that seems a day or two shy of its next trim and
clothing that is — in a word — utilitarian, he resembles
nothing so much as the publisher of a natural foods
catalogue.
From his place by the car, he eyes the house for a moment.
Then, pushing forward the driver's seat, he leans in and
dislodges a long, rectangular object (his unassembled,
portable massage table) that is wedged diagonally across
the interior of the car.
Along with the massage table, he pulls out what used to be
known as a "gym bag." He then glances at his watch, locks
the driver's door, and with massage table and bag in hand
circles around to the sidewalk leading up to the house.

When Fitch reaches the front steps, he removes a business
card (not his own) and matches the hand-written name
scrawled on the back of it with the name by the door. He
takes another look at his watch then presses a button on
the intercom.

She peers at him a moment longer, then:

suspicion)
Yes?
I'm Fitch.

FITCH
Fitch.
NINA

Fitch?
FITCH
I'm here for your appointment.
As if to introduce some physical evidence in his defense,
he points to the portable massage table at his side.
NINA
Where's Douglas?
FITCH
Didn't he call you? He said he was —
he would — call you. He
didn't call you.
NINA
To tell me what?
FITCH
That he couldn't make it.

It's difficult to tell which has Nina puzzled more: Fitch's
presence or his appearance. Whoever the much talked about

Nina then takes an absent-minded step back, giving the
impression — more or less unintended — that she would like
Fitch to come right in.
Without giving it a second thought, he squeezes by her into
the house. And so he's well inside before she even
realizes what has happened.
FITCH
So where would you like me to set up,
Nina?
Without waiting for a response, Fitch starts for the
adjoining bedroom, but Nina intercepts him.
NINA
We're usually this way.
She extends a hand, indicating the end of the hallway is
their intended direction of travel. With a bemused shake
of the head, Nina closes the front door and follows.

You see, I'm really very ...

Fitch nods a small, noncommittal nod.
NINA
I like him....
Fitch nods again.
NINA
I really like him....
Fitch nods yet again.
NINA
And it takes time — for a woman, at
least — it takes time getting
comfortable, really comfortable with

He's very

NINA
He's not so terribly young.
FITCH
No, not so. But he is young. A lot
younger than he thinks he is, anyway.
Besides, he could have not called
either one of us.
A beat, as he walks farther onto the deck, drinking in the
surroundings.
NINA
He's very talented.
FITCH
He is. Good-looking kid, too. Women
seem to go for him. A lot of his
clients are women. Most, really.
At this, she says nothing.
FITCH
Outside's nice. Especially if you
have some privacy. And you have some
privacy.
NINA
Douglas does me outside.
FITCH

closer. Without the slightest hesitation, he resumes
studying the diamond bracelet that he spreads across his
palm.
FITCH
I'm fascinated with things. That is,
I'm fascinated with the fascination
with things.
NINA
This is my bedroom.
FITCH
I thought it might be. My mother had
a spectacular jewelry collection, as I
recall.
A dubious beat, as she wonders just what he may be up to.
FITCH
(sensing her distrust)
I wanted to wash up. And when I
happened to walk by ...
She hands over the sheets and towels, which forces him to
hand over the bracelet.

FITCH
Well, I wanted to wash up.
She leads him into the bathroom, which we recognize as the
one that Doug was showering in earlier.

INT. HOUSE — STUDIO — DAY

From a chair, Nina looks on as Fitch goes about the ritual
of setting up his massage table. And it is just that: a
ritual. Each piece, each bolt, each nut and washer, he
assembles with devotion and ceremony, all of it perhaps as
unconscious as not.
FITCH
What massage is about in the end is
healing. There are ways people can
heal without drugs or words or
prayers. That's it; that's the
essence.
NINA
I never really gave it much thought.
FITCH
Healing?
NINA
Massage — in those terms. I try not
to intellectualize things too much.
It makes life so grey. I'm more ...
intuitive, I think.
She watches as Fitch again immerses himself in his ritual,
then:
NINA
How old are you?
FITCH
(smiling)
Why do you ask?
NINA
I don't know, why not ask? I mean,
you never learn anything without
asking, do you?
FITCH
(still smiling)
Older than you.

She is now staring at him, as we:

an easel with the same sense of ritual and attention. The
man looks up when we hear:

The laying on of hands — there's
power in it.
CUT TO:
47

THE SUN ROOM — AS BEFORE

Fitch looks up briefly from his work, seeing her staring at
him. But, clearly, he doesn't give it a second thought as
he once more focuses his attention on the table.
FITCH
But, in our culture, there are so
many Western prejudices about illness
and healing. We're really pretty
tight-assed, medically speaking.
Just think about it: when was the
last time your doctor actually
touched you? not probed or examined
but touched you?
NINA
If it never happened, it was too
recent. I don't like doctors — mine
or anyone else's.
FITCH
Because they consult with you, they
talk with you over the phone, they
prescribe drugs for you. But they
don't actually — personally — heal
you. They leave that up to time or
chemistry.
NINA
I don't like doctors because ... I
don't like doctors.
A beat, then:

CONTINUED:
NINA
You've known Doug for how long?

Fitch shrugs: Doug is a topic of conversation that he can
either take or leave. And right now he feels more like
leaving it than taking it.
NINA
Long enough to like him?
FITCH
How long's that?
(beat)
It goes back to the ancients, you
know.
NINA
What's that?
FITCH
Massage. Maybe even earlier, some
historians think. The Greeks were
into massage mainly as a treatment, a
healing art. They've got records of
people like Socrates and Plato being
massaged daily. And Plato lived to
be 104.
NINA
Socrates did not.
FITCH
(undeterred)
But the Romans being who they were —
essentially Italians without the
loafers — they were the first to come
up with the idea of massage as a form
of foreplay. Courtesans got pretty
handy at it. It was part of the
transaction, finally.
NINA
Well, it's not like you have to have
a degree in molecular biology to see
a connection. Massage is sexual.
Very sexual.
FITCH
It can be. It doesn't have to be.
It shouldn't always be.

CONTINUED:
NINA
I wasn't talking about sweating,
screaming, orgasmic epiphany. It's
just that you're lying there naked,
someone's touching you in places you
sure wouldn't let your father touch
you, and it's ... arousing.
FITCH
It's a form of communication. You
just have to make sure you're both
speaking the same language.
Fitch makes a few final adjustments to the table.

Seeing that he is nearly finished, Nina she sheds her robe.
It takes a moment for her to locate a towel, during which
time Fitch gets an eyeful.
He says nothing. She says nothing. But neither her
complete lack of embarrassment nor his utter professional
disinterest strikes us as entirely authentic. Finally
spotting her towel, she draws it carelessly around herself.
Fitch stands up.
NINA
Looks like we're ready to start.
FITCH
We've already started.
NINA
What do you mean?
Fitch reaches for his massage "tool bag" and begins
removing items.
FITCH
Well, most of any massage worth having
takes place in your head. And I'm sure
you've been preparing —
(suddenly, a thought
occurs to him)
Why, are you in a hurry?
Before she can reply, he pulls an extremely odd and not
easily explained item out of his bag of tricks. He holds
it up for her to see.
FITCH
Funny thing, hunh?

From his bag, he removes an impressive assortment of
bottles and jars. He selects one then begins applying oil
in long, slow, sweeping strokes until the whole of her back
is slick and glistening.

Hands float ... fingers unfold ... forearms bunch ...
biceps flex ... shoulders tauten ... as IN and OUT OF FRAME

complete mastery of his art: he is nothing short of the
Baryshnikov of massage.

Younger. Slightly more muscular. Noticeably less
accomplished. Decidedly less poetic. More ballroom than
ballet. More James T. Farrell than Marcel Proust.
And when the CAMERA moves slowly BACK, we see that it is
not Fitch massaging Nina but the handsome, rugged man:
Douglas.
Every now and then, she lets out a small, involuntary sigh,
which after a time begins to sound very much like a moan.
This goes on for a moment or two, growing in intensity,
until the spell is broken by:
NINA

It's my job, you know....

Fitch continues with warm, luxurious, circulating strokes,
beginning at the small of her back and flowing up to her
shoulder blades.
NINA
You were going to say something about
how tense I am....
Maybe he was. More likely he was undergoing some out-ofbody experience, so deep is his concentration on the area
of her back that he massages.
NINA
Douglas always does. He's always
telling me how much tension I have.
Especially in my upper back, my
shoulders. It's all because of my
work....
A beat of expectation, as she waits for him to question her
about her work. Then, when he does not, when he simply
continues massaging her in intense silence, she answers
anyway:
NINA
I own a gallery. A couple of them,
actually. One here in town, off
Melrose. Another in New York,
Tribeca. And when it's your business,

say about responsibility falling on
your shoulders. It does — literally.
A beat, then:
FITCH
It's best not to talk so much.
NINA
Was I? talking too much?
FITCH
Well, it's your massage. You can do
anything you'd like. But you really
should take some time to relax. I
mean, you can't keep going all the
time. Or is that what the people you
work with do?

where the bearded man paints at an easel. The painting
that he labors at is perhaps more naturalistic than what is
fashionable these days. The work is nevertheless
accomplished.
Just then, Nina drives by in her CAR. For some reason, the
sight of the man at his easel captures her imagination.
She makes a u-turn and drives back.
After a moment, she is out of the car and over his
shoulder. He turns, surprised to see anyone anywhere near
him. She continues studying the painting, even as he
studies her.

it just depends how badly you want
what you want...
Another brief beat, then:

sort of person who does.
FITCH
And what sort of person is that?
NINA
Well, an ...

What do you mean?
FITCH
(more musing than
argumentative)
Just that I never thought there was a
type, that's all. But I suppose
you'd know more about that than I
would.
NINA
Well, do you? enjoy art?
FITCH
(after a moment of
consideration)
Who do you consider to be the great
artists of this century?
NINA
How do you mean?

I mean who are the five greatest — or
four — or three?

I'm really not in that business.

artistic achievement FITCH
- or would you say Braque? or Klee?
NINA
What's your point, Fitch?

Instead of replying, Fitch retreats for a moment, again
massaging her in silence. His strokes now become a tease —
although from all appearances an inadvertent one — as his
hands move nearer and nearer her ass.
Finally, in a series of deep, slow strokes, he slips his
hands under the towel and withdraws them, then slips them
under again — to which she visibly succumbs. Her eyelids
close heavily.

INT. HALLWAY — DAY

Returning from his car, Fitch is clicking together TWO
LARGE MAGNETS as he walks down the hall. Suddenly, a
painting hanging on the wall catches his eye. It's about
then that Nina emerges from the studio.
FITCH
This is just me now, this is just my
opinion. But so much of what passes for
art today — contemporary art — is without
any kind of reference point: moral,
historic, nothing. It's not about
anything.

Oh, I disagree. Modern art is
critical. That's what makes it
modern.

apprehension —
NINA
You really must visit my gallery.
We've got a very interesting
installation coming up next month I
think you should see.
FITCH
And what's that?
NINA
A history of women's fashion as a
form of bondage.
Fitch cocks an amused eyebrow.
NINA
Come and see it. I think you'll
enjoy it. It has a certain point of
view. It's funny. Ironic. Satiric.
FITCH
A point of view.
NINA
Exactly.

FITCH
I'll tell you — and this is why so

society, is a kind of bankruptcy of
spirit.

I'm sure people have said something like
as long as there have been people to say

She nods. He indicates that she should sit in it, which
she does. He then kneels before her, placing a warmed
magnet beneath either of her feet.
NINA
Fear of change. Fear of the future.
Technology transforming things faster

people create the art they create.

actions.
NINA
So what would you suggest?
FITCH
I suggest we look inward, all of us,
for starters. And then, I suggest we
look outward.
NINA
And then do we all sit cross-legged
on the floor, humming like gnats?

We might. We could. Why not? Or

just generally enjoys herself.

Gone now. They've been dead a while.
I have a sister back in Sydney.

I try to stay close to my family.
It's important, don't you think? My

thing I've learned: we don't know

But before she can respond, the strength of his acupressure causes
her to exhale hoarsely suddenly.
FITCH

applying pressure)
This isn't too hard for you, Nina?
NINA
(breathless)
Why do you ask?
Fitch lays off on the acupressure, smoothing over the area
with lush, soothing strokes.
NINA
I had aspirations, artistic
aspirations. Except that I saw
myself up onstage somewhere, a
performer. Only problem was I
couldn't sing or dance. I could
audition. I mean, my gift is I know
how to sell and so I sold myself.
And in rehearsal, come to think of
it, I was okay, passable.
FITCH
Would I have ever seen you in
anything?
NINA
No.

Lucky man.

She laughs at this. But if what she says is an
exaggeration, there clearly remains some element of truth
to it.
NINA
It was in school, mostly. But once
or twice, in an otherwise
professional theatre, I actually got
up in front of a paying audience ...

In contrast, Fitch's contact with her strikes us as far

But appearances can, as they say, be deceiving.

It's made me a better person. Sure.
I suppose. Happier than most people.
If that's what it's about.
Nina seems puzzled.
FITCH
There's more to happiness than being
happy.
NINA
Meaning what?

Suddenly, we are back into the foot massage, with it neareroticism in CLOSE UP.
We take a beat, then:
FITCH
You see, with most people — cultures
— civilizations — this idea of
happiness — it's not some frivolous
thing. It's not a good job. It's
not a new car in the driveway. It's
something else entirely.
NINA
Something spiritual.

The Hopi Indians believe the body of
a person and the earth are formed in

Two Hearts are causing me my pain.
Fitch is visibly annoyed, noticeably tired of humoring her
smugness. He wanders away from the table.
FITCH
It works, though, you know, this kind
of healing. What we forget is modern
medicine — any science when you think
about it — is a belief system: a
religion like any other religion.
Medicine works because we believe it
will work.

NINA
I see. So you're suggesting — what?
— I convert? Become a Hopi mystic?
Can you do that, by the way? Convert
to another race?
FITCH
The point I was making, really, is
that we have — without even realizing
it — given up one kind of mysticism
for another, more socially acceptable
form of mysticism. I don't know
about you, but I've never seen a
black hole or a quark. They may
exist; they may not; I personally
have no way of knowing. I have seen
Hopis walk away healed, though, by
nothing more than a medicine man
using his hands and a few crystals.
NINA
Christ, you're patronizing.
FITCH
All I'm saying is we — everyone —
we've gone and replaced a system of
belief with a system of disbelief.
And that it's found its way into
everything we do and think. We've
lost the capacity for wonder. And no
one — and this is the insidious part
— no one even knows that it's

For the first time, he truly sees her: in sharp contrast to
the dowdy, doughy matron one might expect to be massaging
in these tony surroundings, she is lithe and sun-bronzed.
She seems to be, moreover, totally available.
Which prompts us to:

If you're ever interested in
something a little different, you
might want to try shiatsu. It's all
about stimulating energy at different
points in the body. No oil of any
kind. Skin rarely touches skin.
I've tried it.

He now goes to work: first, oiling one side of her buttocks
then the other; next, working in the oil with slow,
glistening, voluptuous strokes.

It's funny. Talking about roles. My
parents had these roles that they always
seemed to ... inhabit. My father was the
shrewd businessman. My mother was the
thoughtful patron of the arts. Which
was, as it turned out, a kind of fiction.
NINA
How?
Making his hands broad, he massages all over her buttocks
in big, circular strokes.
FITCH
Well, it was all the same to her.
Classical music. Classical art.
Didn't matter who or what it was. It
was all lovely. The woman — and over
the years I've come to almost admire
this about her — she didn't have a
critical bone in her body. She was
the sort of person they created
public television for.
He tries to lose himself in the rhythm of his movements,
the strokes he performs deep into her buttocks. But it
doesn't work. Not this time.

their own expectations of themselves.

Fitch has positioned himself at the head of the table as he
begins a series of broad, circular motions just below the
collarbone.
FITCH
Maybe the whole thing's a question of
perception.
NINA
What is?
FITCH
It's not the way people see you
that's the problem but the way you
see them seeing you.
NINA
How do you mean?
FITCH
Well, like, Doug. He said you were —
the word he used was
adrift. He never mentioned anything
about being single or not being
single. He never mentioned anything
at all. Beyond the initial
observation, that is.
NINA
I'm not sure I follow.

CONTINUED:
His fingers drift nonchalantly lower down her chest,
suggesting that he would be the last person to let
something like a breast break the rhythm of his strokes.
FITCH
You like things, nice things.
NINA
I do.
FITCH
And you have nice things, lots of
them.
NINA
A few.
FITCH
And, yet, you feel like a failure.
NINA
Did I say that?
FITCH
Don't you?

With his palms, he gently strokes the sides of her breasts,
steadfastly refusing to move his hands any closer to her
nipples.
CUT TO:
164

NINA AND DOUGLAS

164

as he moves his hands slowly around her breasts, encircling
the nipples, coming teasingly close to touching them only
to pull away.
He repeats this pattern once or twice more until, finally,
he lets his fingers caress her nipples. Her back tenses.
He gently pulls at them, twisting them slightly as he does.
She exhales loudly. He pinches them between his thumb and
index finger. Her body stiffens.
CUT TO:
165

NINA AND FITCH

165

as he brings his hands back to her collarbone, never having
touched her nipples directly, leaving her visibly
frustrated.

CONTINUED:
NINA
Are you going to hold up your
crystals and tell me I'm of Two
Hearts?
FITCH
No. But, you see, what I believe is
not "ooga-booga bullshit." It comes
from first-hand experience. There
are people who have possessions, lots
of possessions, and they are made
miserable by them.
NINA
And there are people who live in
refrigerator crates who'd trade
places in a second. I buy things, I
admit it. But I'm not a materialist.
Not really. Because, to me, things
are things. They mean nothing.
FITCH
Not true. They carry memories.
That's the way they're meaningful —
as a link to other people.
NINA
Well, all I know is I usually end up
just getting frustrated by all that
conspicuous consumption, angry even.
FITCH
Because you think whatever it is
you're buying will make you happier.
Or younger. Or sexier.
NINA
I see what you're doing, you know.
You're trying to convince me how
miserable I am.
FITCH
And am I succeeding?
NINA
No, just pissing me off.
FITCH
Why's that?
NINA

Because unlike you, nothing was ever

given to me, that's why. And it's
not money I'm talking about, not
just. Everything I own — everything
I have — I've earned, one way or
another. So don't tell me I'm wrong
— don't tell me I'm immoral — just
because I decided to make something
of my life and you didn't. I mean,
shouldn't a man your age be
something?
FITCH
I know you've made something of your
life. I'm just asking you what that
is.
Nina bolts upright.
No, you're not!

NINA
Not anymore.

A long beat, as they remain eye-to-eye for a moment. She
then slide herself off the table, rising to her feet.
NINA
You know what they difference is
between you and me? Really? The
difference is you have spent so much
time completely rationalizing your
life that you actually believe it....
You are a very lonely man, Fitch.
FITCH
You let him touch you.
NINA
Who?
CUT TO:
166

NINA AND DOUGLAS

as he spider-walks his fingers around her breasts,
encircling the nipples.

FITCH
You expect him to touch you.

pinches them between his thumb and his index finger.

ANGLE ON NINA AND FITCH

169

as she backs off slightly.
FITCH
That's what it's about, isn't it?
Doug and you — it's about sex.
Nina doesn't respond.
FITCH
Isn't it?
NINA
I don't know.
A beat, then:
NINA
Did he say something to you?
Douglas?
Fitch shakes his head: no.
Oh, Christ.

NINA
That obvious, hunh?

She slouches back toward the massage table.
NINA
I know it's nothing to him. He's
very discreet about it. And it's not
like he does anything more than touch
me. It's about as safe as sex gets
these days.
She now drops herself on the table and sits.
NINA
I try to be, too: discreet. We never
talk about it. We just pretend it's
part of the massage.
(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
FITCH
Which it is.
A brief beat, then:
NINA
All relationships are a kind of
currency, I've come to the
unfortunate conclusion. I'm using
you just like you're using me using
you using me. On and on it goes....
The money part — it's, at least,
honest.
A long beat, then the TELEPHONE RINGS.

Both heads snap in the direction of the phone as it rings
again ... and again ... and again ... until Nina's
answering machine CLICKS ON:
NINA'S VOICE
(from the answering
machine)
Hi, this is Nina. At the sound of
the tone, the voice you hear will be
your own....
We hear the shrill BEEP, then:
A MAN'S VOICE
(from the machine)
Nina, you there? It's me: Douglas.
Fitch and Nina exchange a look.
FITCH
You're not going to get it?
Clearly, she is not.

So we:

As the answering machine CLICKS OFF, Fitch and Nina share
another look. She then reclines on the table, propping
herself up on one elbow.
NINA
This is not the most relaxing massage
I've ever had.
FITCH
But it's the best.
She half-laughs at this then lowers her shoulder, lying
back on the table until she is completely supine.
He stands back for a moment, as if not quite knowing what
to do next. He then reaches for a bottle and spreads oil
thickly across her belly, from just below her breasts.
He now begins some short, deep strokes across her abdomen,
careful to avoid even the slightest contact with anything
like an erogenous zone.
Sexual contact would, in any case, be totally extraneous at
this point. For in some perceptible though indescribable
way, the two are now connected more completely and more
intimately than sex would ever have allowed them to be.
NINA
I wasn't being totally honest.
FITCH
About what?
NINA
Men. Men and me. As much as I
choose not to believe it, the truth
is I've been involved with a lot of
them. It's always more of the same,
sorry to say.

Nina and the painter sit across from one another, holding

Very well.
She smiles at him strangely.

Better than I treated him.

along the side of the same lonely road, toward a flashing
red light that grows brighter and redder as he approaches.
Finally, a POLICE CAR comes INTO VIEW and just beyond it
THE WRECKAGE OF AN AUTOMOBILE.
Two EMTS are in the midst of pulling Alice from the
wreckage. They are in no particular hurry to get her up
the embankment and inside the ambulance; they have no
reason to be.
In death — or more accurately, Fitch's imagination of it —
she is just as she was in life: achingly beautiful,
untouched, without a bruise or scratch.

THE STUDIO

194

Fitch stops for a moment and Nina turns to face him.
FITCH
I came to a place once, not long ago.
It was a lonely place, an empty place
with no hope and, I thought, no way
out. It's a place I could have
easily been lost in forever. But,
slowly, I began to understand
something — that I put myself in that
place, and that it was up to me to
get myself out. And so I chose hope.
I chose belief.
(physically referring to
his various mystical
items)
You see, it's all true. God has to
be all things to all people. To be
anything less would be less than
perfect — human. What you believe in
isn't nearly so important as
believing in something. But just
don't wait too long, or you may find
yourself believing in nothing.
CUT TO:

FITCH — MOVING

through the doorway into the rural house.
Once inside, he is met by a towering HOPI dressed in
cermonial garb. The Hopi extends an arm in the direction
of the center of the room. It's there that Fitch sees a
casket with its top open.
Fitch leaves the Hopi and crosses reluctantly to the
casket. He looks down. There lies the perfect, lifeless
body of the young woman, Alice.

Seventy-five, then.
She presses all the money in his hand.

With a twenty-five dollar tip.
He smiles and pockets the money.

You get your way, don't you?

From his pocket, he removes what looks like a computer
chip.

then turns her hand so that her fist faces downward. He
then touches the top of her hand with his index finger
FITCH
I want you to think about not
dropping it, and that's all I want
you to think about.
NINA
Not dropping it — okay.
FITCH
Concentrate. Try as hard as you can.
But on the count of ten, the chip is
going to fall from your hand, and
you'll have absolutely no power to
stop it.

All right.

Ready? One ... two ... three ...

The chip drops from her hand. He catches it on the fly.
He holds it for a moment then hands it back to her.

What about him?
FITCH
I can't just take his gig away.
NINA
Douglas is young.
FITCH
So?
NINA
He'll find someone else to replace
me. Women like him. That's what you
said.
FITCH
Well, it's not that I don't want to
come back.
NINA
Do you?
FITCH
Yes.

Then, I'll work something out with

it's that important, I'll have you
