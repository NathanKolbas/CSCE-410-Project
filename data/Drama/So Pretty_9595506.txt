So Pretty

FADE IN:

EXT. CHICAGO OUTSKIRTS - NIGHT
The city skyline illuminates the clouded sky above.

An elevated train blots out the view as it passes by at close
proximity.

INT. TRAIN - NIGHT
Four PASSENGERS. They sit some distance from one another.

SEAN, 30’s, is the best looking of the bunch. Crystal blue
eyes. A fashionably worn leather jacket and shoes to match.
He leans his head against a window towards the front of the
car.

The train comes to a stop.

The door opens. LISA, 20’s, enters and finds a seat across
from Sean. She has on green hospital scrubs. Her hair is
unnaturally BLACK. So is her fingernail polish.

She reaches into her purse and pulls out a copy of
“TWILIGHT”. She opens the book and begins to read. The train
continues.

She looks up to digest something she just read. She catches
Sean staring at her. He smiles.

SEAN
I read all of those. Interesting
take on vampires.

LISA
Me too. This one’s my fave though.
Third time.

SEAN

Seems like everyone is infatuated
with vampires these days. They
either want to date one... or be
one.

LISA
You talking about the hair?

He nods. She smiles. Pulls a lock of it into her view.
LISA
I got all vamped up for a costume
party a couple of weeks ago. Just
couldn’t seem to let the color go.

SEAN
It suits you. I’m Sean.

LISA
Lisa.

She dives back into her book.

SEAN
I just have a hard time believing
it would be so easy to be a
vampire.

She remains engrossed in her book.

SEAN (CONT'D)
In Bram’s version it wasn’t easy.
Always hunted...

LISA
Bram?

She looks up. Squints her eyes.

SEAN
Bram Stoker? He wrote Dracula?
Pretty much put vampires on the
map.

LISA
Oh, I had to read that in high
school. I thought it sucked.

SEAN
You're a fan of vampires, yet you
didn’t like Dracula?

She shrugs her shoulders. Offers a guilty smile.

LISA
Nope, sorry. Thought it was boring.

SEAN
Maybe being a vampire is not
supposed to be so glamorous. Always
hunted, truly cursed in love, and
the decisions.
Sean shakes his head. Looks at the passengers.

LISA
Decisions?

SEAN
Who to kill. To live with the guilt
of playing god.

LISA
I would think they would just eat
animals. Like the Cullens.

She points to her book.

SEAN
Humans eat animals. Not vampires.

LISA
Says you. I think it’s okay to make
changes in the legend. Times
change. People’s tastes differ.

SEAN
Because that’s not a curse. Seems
more like a gift. Would you still
want to be a vampire if you had to
kill people?

She crumples her face. Taps fingers on her chin.
LISA
I think so. They’re just so
beautiful. So misunderstood.
SEAN
Really? Then humor me for a second.
You're a vampire who likes to hunt
on late night trains...
He smiles. She rolls her eyes.
He nods his head towards the other passengers.

SEAN (CONT’D)
Which one?

She peruses the train. A thin OLD MAN, 70's, with a Homburg
hat on his head sits towards the back of the car.

A PLUMP WOMAN, 40's, ruffles through a purse the size of a
gym bag. She chews gum at a fevered pace.
A LARGE MAN, 30's, rests his head against the window. He

wears a sleeveless vest. Arms covered in tattoos. A bandana

on his head.
Lisa smiles.

LISA
You don’t think I could do it, do
you?

SEAN
Then do it.

LISA
The big guy, with all the tatt’s.

Sean studies him with her.

SEAN
Why him?

LISA
Because he looks like a thug. Like
he’s a gang member.

SEAN
Who knows, he could be a big teddy
bear. Maybe he’s a hard working
guy, three children at home and a
loving wife.

LISA
Or, maybe he’s gang member.

Back to her book.
SEAN
So you would just pick people based
on their looks?

LISA
Why not? Gotta feed right?

Lisa laughs.

SEAN
Sooner or later, it would get to
you... I think there’s a better

candidate over there.

Lisa purses her lips. Sean nods to the passengers again.
takes them in.

She
LISA
Then the fat woman.

Sean gazes at the woman.

SEAN
Why her?

LISA
I just have a problem with people
who don‘t take care of themselves.

SEAN
Maybe she has a thyroid problem, or
low self esteem.

Lisa sighs. Throws up her hands.

LISA
Then you pick one, Dr. Phil.

SEAN
The old man.

Sean stares at the old man with piercing eyes.

LISA
Why him? He looks harmless.

SEAN
His name is Edgar Wilcox. He’s a
retired auto worker. He actually
does have three kids and a loving
wife...

Sean’s eyes return to Lisa.

SEAN (CONT'D)
He’s also a pedophile.

The train begins to slow.

LISA
How? Why do you know this?

SEAN
Because, it’s the best I can do.

Sean stands. Lisa can see her reflection in the window behind
him, but not his. Her eyes widen.
SEAN
You're gonna want to get off this
train now.

He walks towards the others. She fumbles her book trying to
get it into her purse. She hastens to the door. Bounces in
anticipation of it’s opening.

SEAN
Edgar Wilcox?

Lisa turns her back to them. Closes her eyes.

EDGAR (0.8.)
Yes. Do I know...
LARGE MAN (0.8. ) WOMAN (0.8.)
What the fuck? Oh my god!

SCREAMS. Flesh TEARING. Heavy FOOTSTEPS in the car. Lisa
covers her mouth. The doors open.
EXT. TRAIN PLATFORM —- CONTINUOUS

Lisa gets knocked over by the large man. The plump woman runs
past. Lisa picks up her bag. Runs to the turn-stile.

SEAN (0.S.)
Lisa!

She stops and turns. A mistake.

Sean's blood spattered face is pressed up against the window.
He stares at her wide eyed, crazed. He licks his fangs as his
fingers rake crimson down the glass.

SEAN
Ain't so pretty now, are we?

The train doors shut. Lisa faints.
Sean SCREAMS as the train resumes.

FADE TO BLACK.

THE END.
