teem before us. They're densely packed, thousands, maybe
millions of them, wriggling with abundant life. Pulling back, ve
realize they're all contained in a single drop of water, and
pulling back further, the drop is one of many on a leaf, and wo
think how truly insignificant those teeming bacteria really are,
becau:

 

ExT TROPICAL RAINFOREST Day 2

-- the leaf is one of a thousand on a trectop, and the tree one of
a million in a lush rainforest. Jungle animals HOOT, branches
bend as they're scampered over, the HUM of insects fills the air,
life is everywhere.

 

wy clouds part and all those billions of leaves turn upward,
etching for the light that comes from the sun, a brilliant
orange ball of warmth, huge in the sky. The sun dissolves to --

xT BARREN PLANET SURFACE DAY 3

 

- another sun, and the contrast could not be greater. Where our
sun is full, rich, and hot, this second sun is tiny, small in its
sky, its rays thin and weak.

We tilt down to the surface of the planet below it. A frozen,
inhospitable plain stretches to the horizon, obscured by driving
sandstorma that must render life above the surfaco impossible.
There's soma evidence that this wasn't always the case, thousand
year-old structures dot the surface, but they're abandoned now,
worn away by the relentless battering of the storas.

As for growth, there's only one type of vegetation tough enough
to survive in this hostile environment ~- a scrabbly red weed.

It's mean and grasping, its sharp tendril:
crevice it can find in the sand-blasted rock and buildings.

ExT A MOUNTAINSIDE DAY 4

Back on earth, springtime blooms on a mountainside. The aun
melts the winter snowfall on the banks of a stream, chunks of
malting white snow are swept away by the swiftly moving water.

High up in the air, we seo the stream is part of a network thot
foods into a larger river, its banks swollen with the rich spring
runoff, This rich network of tributaries dissolves to --

-- a wider view of the surface of the barren planet, and a nearly
matching mountainside. But this one is dead, dried out rivers
carved into its face like acne scars. A VOICE comes over:

He's bent forward, looking through the clear floor of the cab,
studying the cargo container he's hauling as he skims the huge
crane across the deck far below.

Down on the dock, the crane nestles the twenty foot cargo
container into the back of a flatbed truck, resting it gently in
a tiny spot.

it de-couples and rises swiftly into the air.

A SIREN blows in the distance, loud. shift's over.

In the cab, Ray works the levers quickly, shutting down, hauling
the crane cab back to the top of the ladder that leads down to
ground level.

As it CLUNKS into place, he stretches out his back -- long shift
in that chair -- then reaches down into a bucket next to his cab
and grabs a chunky gold watch he puts there for safekeeping while
he's working, He SHAPS it onto hie wrist.

The sun comes up over the Anchor Inn, a tavern nestled under a
freeway overpass near the docks.

Int ANCHOR IHW DANE 13

A pinball gots smacked around the table, BINGING off the buxpers
in a hot game.

Ray stands in front of it, working the flippers. He manages to
throw a hip into the pinball machine without upending the beer
bottle that rests on top of the glass. Unfortunately, the second
hip he smacks into the machine is a little too hard and the “TILT”
light lights up.

She picks up the remote for the TV that hangs over the bar.
There's a news report on CNH, wo can't hear what the ANCHOR is
saying, but the graphic is fleetingly legible --

energy, because suddonly there is lightning everywhere, arcing
across the sky, striking trees and television aerials and
flagpoles and olotheslines, even, it's a true lightning storn.

 

Ray throws open the back door of the house, grabs Rachel, and
beats her inside.

Ray SLAMS the back door and locks it (not sure why), runs to the

glimpse of what's going on in the front of the house -- lightning

Ha reaches the actual crack in tha macadam and bends down to
investigate for himself. A fow others are there too, running
their hands over the edges of it.

The crack ia charred all along its edges, and rimmed with big
chunks of what looks like broken glass. Ray picks one up and
looks at it in the light -- it's similar to glass, but not quite.
He touches the edges, and they're soft, but when he bangs the
thing on the concrete, it doesn't break.

Woird. Ray reaches down to run bia hand over the other chunks of
whatever-it-is, but as he touches the edge of the crack, a
strange look crosses his face, ie lifts his hand off. Puts it on
again.

 
 

He looks at the GUY next to him, who is studying the damaged
street as well.
Feel that?

The Guy puts his hands down flat against the edge of the crack. A
look crosses his face. Whatever it is, he feals it too.

Ray looks up. There's a parking meter a few feet away from hin.
He studies it.

It's trembling.
Bver so lightly.

Ray looks back down. As he vatches, a few small chunks of asphalt
break off the edge of the crack and fall inside.

Ray stands up, shoving the piece of “broken glass” into his
pocket.

RAY (cont'd)
It's moving.

CRACK!

Ray whirls around. Behind him, the sound of CRACKING glass has
penetrated the still air.

He looks at the house on the corner, a narrow row house like his.

‘The crowd, which had gone silent, is starting to MURMUR and
CHATTER when suddenly --

-- everyone near the crack in the pavement is thrown to the
ground.

Wow there are some SCREAMS. It's especially vexing because only
those in a roughly circuler area around the crack itself were
thrown off their £ Bveryone outside the circular area is

Ray’s on the ground, but he looks up between the legs of thoi

Bxoopt now it's in the middle of the street.

‘The other parking meters are still where they wero, in a neat
line on tha sidowalk, but this one looks as if it bas somehow
migrated out into traffic.

straight line, neither the street, or the edges of tha front
yards, A huge circular section of this neighborhood has suddonly
twisted three fest counter-clockwise, throwing everything out of

There is great concern, but not quite panic.

Until the earthquake starts, that is. Becat Ray climbs to
his feet, that entire circle starts to rotate again, like a big
turntable, causing tremors that ripple out from its center,
spidervebbing the pavement and sidewalks like ico in the
springtime.

The houses at the edges of the circle are ripping apart, right
down the middie, their facades tearing away, revealing cutawayo
of the houses’ interiors.

Ray, buffeted by the crowd as it flees the epicenter, comes eye
to eye with that rogue parking meter again. It's rattling
violently ap it rotates around the edge of the circle, spitting
coins from the door in its front, which has oprung open.

  

A FOOLISH GUY moves along with it, scooping up the coins.

Ray bolts to the edge of the circle, which is now plainly marked
by the ruptures made by its rotation. Sverybody clears it,
moving to the edges like soap flakes in a water glass.

The rotation stops.

Evorything stops.
Silence for a second.

Those who still remain stare into the middle of the perfect
circle, which is now empty.

Ray looks at Vincent and Julio, who are standing next to him.
Hobedy knows what to gay. They look to the edge of the @ road, at
the now-cutaway facades of the houses, see a WOMAN in her

upstairs bedroom, staring in disbeliof at her new view of the
street.

Okay, the buildup's over. Suddenly and with such force that we
feel complotoly unprepared, the ceater of the crack heaves up
into the air, spewing dirt, rock, and asphalt in all directions.

What's left of the crowd surges backwards, away from it, which is
good, because the geyser of earth that shoots out of the ground
4g poverful and voluminous. Water mains SHAP lika toothpicks,
sending geysers of water billowing into the air.

But still much of the crowd stays to gavk, standing in half-
fascinated terror.

Ray and those around him are knocked into the air and land hard on
their backs in the street. He sits up, but it’s hard to see
anything clearly, there's dirt and water in the air and the
earthquake is still going on, everything is jarred, shaking, but
the one thing he gets a good look at --

~~ is the lag.

Long, spindly, mechanical, it claws up out of the torn earth and
8 down into the pavement just in front of hin.

It‘s followed by a second leg, and a third, long seamingly-
metallic tubes threo feet in diameter, telescoping in the
strangest manner we've ever seen, they soam to both oxpand and
collapse simultaneously, as if the metal were flowing, in and
cut, over itself, in continual flux.

As each of the three logs plants itself at oquidiotant points
around the oiroumference of the circle, a bavolled pad irises out
of the bottom and claws into the aarth, stabilizing itself.

‘Then, as one, the three legs WEIR to life and exert prossure
inward. From the conter of the hole in the street, the carth-
smeared, squarioh hulk of... something rises out of the ground.

Thon the powerful legs kick in again and it begins to rise,

Whatever samblance of calm there was bofore is utterly gone now,

out in the open, of course, but in tho mouths of alleys and
driveways, behind cara, in doorvays, half-sheltered groups of
four and five staring opon-mouthed at the apparition.

In the street, there is no one, no sound.

grabs him by the collar and pulls him back.

In the street, the mirrored disk turns ever so slightly, trailing
the Photographers as they make their way into the open, just
watching them, apparently it means them no harm.

Ray breathes a small sigh of relief.

Now, emboldaned by the first two Photographers, HALF A DOZEN

anyone back, The sudden movament of the crowd causes the Tripod
head to snap inte action. It pivots quickly, seeming to brace
itself, and the mirrored disk rotates, sweeping once across the
street in a slow arc.

 

The air betweon the disk and the material objects on the ground
wavers, heat ripples like off the highway on a summer day, and
slowly overything before it ia incinerated.

So swift and terrible is the heat ray's destruction that before
Ray can even back away, it's nearly upon hin, wiping out the

This is seon from inside the car, which perhaps makes it even
more stunning and horrific.

The kids can only stare in stunned horror, but Ray drops the car
in gear, hits the gas, and cranks the wheel.

The car spins a one-cighty in the parking lot, cutting around
Manny, who has fallen back from the tree in horror. His Mechanic
takes off running, but in the wrong direction, straight out into
the street, toward the approaching chaos.

At the edge of the driveway, Ray SLAMS on the brakes, reaches in
back, and throws open the rear passenger door.

Ha SCREAMS at Manny.

RAY (cont'd)

Manny is standing in dumb terror, looking up at the trea, at the
fleeing people, and at Ray.

RAY (cont'd)
GET IH, MANNY, OR YOU ARE GOING TO DIE!

‘These are words Rachel has never, ever heard spoken in earnest.
She starts to SCREAM.

Manny has a two-second window here to adjust to the new reality

w+ he clings, snapping out of his stupor with a look of fury.

MANWY
Get the hell out of that car!

Wrong answer, and there's no more time for the right one. Ray
Bits the gas and the car SCREECHES out of the parking lot,
leaving the furious Manny behind, SHOUTING at them —-

~~ until he ia incinerated by the heat ray. His gas station busts
into flama.

Again, the kids begin SCREAMING, but it's hard to hear over the
racing engine, the SCREECHING tires.

Ray leans forward, trying 11ke hell to see through the
windshield, through the smoke that’s now blanketing the block.

hit a freeway on-ramp.

We rise up, to gat a look at the freeway. It's a massive parking

vehicles aro either still working or have been repaired.)

Tho SCREAMING SIRENS are deafening as they blast past. In the

Ray just looks at him, can‘t bring himsolf to actually say “an
alien.” Robbie returns the look for a long, puzzled moment, then
suddenly understanding breaks across is face and he grasps what
his father is trying to tell him without saying.

Robbie leans further forward and looks up, out the front
windshield. His eyes crawl up, to search the skies.

something from Robbie's backpack, which 1 against the wall.

The narrow window over Ray's hoad RATTLES lightly in its frano,
shsken by the wind.

Or is it the wind? Because the window starts RATTLING harder,
too hard for just wind.

Ray's eyes pop open. He looks up, at the pale moonlight coming
through the RATTLING window.

Ray twists in his chair, looks up at the window. He gets up and
stretches to look out through it.

Outaide the window, there is a silent, blinding flash of purple
ant that _{1luninates the entire basement as if it were daytime

Both kids sit bolt upright.

urgently. Robbie SHOUTS back, points to the other side of the

flight of staira that leads to the basement. There‘s daylight
coming around the edges of the door at the top of the stairs.

Without waking the kids, he climbs the short flight of stairs and
turns the knob. He pushes.

But tho door won't open. He leans up against it, puts his
shoulder into it and forces it open about two feet, which is all
it will give.

Immediately, he winces from the brilliant daylight, but why is

realizes --

Stunned, Ray picks his way through the wreckage and climbs the
basement stairs, which load up to ground level.

ExT RUINED HOUSE DAY 58

Ray reaches the top of the stairs and stands in the ruins of the
house. It's not so much that the house was torn down, more that
it was sheared off its foundation, as if something reached down
and awiped it away.

Wa're looking at Ray, but something's obstructing our vision,
something turning, spinning in front of us.

All around, thick black amoke wafts through the air, and as a
breeze picks up, it parts, revealing to Ray the source of tho
deafening explosion they heard last night, and finally wo

of one of the engines, turned slowly by the morning brease.

 

 

Wrackage is everywhore, the entire row of houses across the
stroot wiped out or by tha orash or tho resulting fire, and
tho debris field extonds a hundred yards in all directions.

street, clipping this house and the one beside it, thon crashed

Sha hits play on the first machine and a jerky, low-resolution
night-viaion image comas up on the screen. Ray peers closely at
it. It's a battlefield, there's fire and oxplosions everywhere,
shot with a very long lens from far away, but in a brief momant of
noar-clarity you can juat barely make out the tall, spindly
shapea that dominate the field.

 

Tripods. Helf a dozen of than.

WEWS PRODUCER (cont'd)
We were foeding How York, but Mew York
went dark, so we patched over to D.C.,
and they went down.

 

Ray peora closar. 8 an enormous amount of atatic and

terference in the shot, but there are flashos when ve can just
make out what's going on -- the Tripods are marching through
city somewhere, maybe downtown Hewark. But whenevor the imago
becomes clear enough to give us a good look, the interference
wipes it out again.

 

 

NEWS PRODUCER (cont’d)
L.A., Chicago, we uplinked to London,

 

 

even called affiliates to try to got
tham to catch the fead, but nobody

It's the same evarywhere -- once the
Tripods start to move, no more news
comes out of that aroa.

Outside, there is an EXPLOSION in the distance. The Cameraman
SHOUTS at them from outside.

CAMERAMAN (0.5.)
We can't stay here!

The Producer hits play on the next machine and Ray moves in closo
to the screan. Wow it's shaky, hand-held footage from right down
in the thick of the battle, this must be how Max lost his hearing.

RAY
Hy God.

NEWS PRODUCER
You ain’t seen nothin yet.

She hits “play” on a third recorder and another screen comes to
ligo. It looks like a mistake at first, it's just brilliant,
blinding flashes that blank out the screen.

RAY
that's one of the lightning storms, I
was in one of those, I saw this.

NEWS PRODUCER
You didn't see it like this. Those
things, the Tripods, they come up out of
the ground, right, so that means they
must hava buried ‘em here a long tine
ago. But who's driving the God damn
things? took.

She slows the image on screen down to a crawl, allowing us to look
closely at one lightning bolt in particular. There's something
in it, an object of sone kind, a thing.

RAY
What... is that?

NEWS PRODUCER
That... is Them.

Another EXPLOSION in the distance, but slightly closer.
Remembering, Ray takes the shard of burnt-glass from his pocket,

the one he picked up earlier. Ho stares at it, thinking. It's
got some structure to it, like the bottom of a Coke bottle.

off Robbie's arm.

Robbie bolts out of the car, MUTTERING under his breath.

Rachel! Right there io fine.

Bhe keops walking, calls back over her shoulder.

RACHEL
I'm not going in front of you guys!

She keeps walking, toward the tree line.

Ray watches for a moment, thinking. He looks around. They
certainly are alone. He looks over the roof of the car at Rachol,
who's nearing the tree line now.

RAY
Stay where I can see you!

Rachel shouts something back, but he can't understand her. she
steps into the trees.

BxT ‘WOODS: DAY nm

Rachel enters the woods at the edge of the field. Looking around
here, you wouldn't droam there's anything unusual going on in the
world «- trees, sunlight, birds, rabbits skipping through the
underbrush.

Rachel looks all around, finds a likely spot, and is about to go
to the bathroom when she hears a sound. she turns.

Nothing threatening, just rushing water. A river. She walks a
few steps more and leoks through a stand of trees. Beyond, she
can see the Hudson River moving past.

The sunlight dapples off its moving surface. It's enticing. she
moves through a stand of trees and comes out --

Rachel stares at it, transfixed, as it moves inexorably past her.
It's a man, or it was, in a business suit, but that's not what
catches her attention. It's his hand, which is still clampod
onto a leather briefcase, the fingers locked around the handle in
a death grip.

It passes, and Rachel lets out a breath of relief. At least it's
gone. She turns to look back upriver --

 

=> and sees hundreds of bodies float around tha bend in the
river, bobbing swiftly toward her like a huge dead ary.

she SCREAMS and turns to run, but there's a MAN behind her, he
geabs her roughly, she SCREAMS louder --

Ray looks up, just as the logjam of corpses moves past them. He
turna his daughter around, away from the carnage, and she buries
her face in his stomach.

EXT ‘THE MIDDLE OF HOWHERE DAY 3

Tho three of them come out of the field and are returning to the
ear when Ray stops suddenly, holding up a hand. The kids stop,
look at him questioningly.

What is that?

In the distance, a low RUMBLING sound is rising up. It gets loud
fast, REALLY loud, They all turn toward a rino in the road, and
tho RUMBLING around them becomes almost deafening as --

+ AN ARMY CONVOY ROARS OVER THE RISE IN THR ROAD.

Tho three of them stare in wonder from the side of the road as an

unprintable things he wants then to do to the invaders,
thankfully lost under the noise. Ray runs aftor him, grabbing
him and pulling him back.

ROBBIE

RAY
What are you, suicidal?

Robbie tears away and keeps up with the convoy. Ray pursues him
and both of them SHOUT over the noise of the passing trucks.

ROBBIE

As a tank rolls past him, Robbie makes eye contact with one of the
SOLDIERS riding on top of it, his head and shoulders protruding
from the hatch. He's not much older than Robbie himself, maybe
nineteen years old.

Robbie stares, star struck, as the Young Soldier passes. Ho
grabs hold of a handle on the back of the tank, it almost pulls
him over. A SOLDIER shouts at him:

   

SOLDIER
Watch it, kid, you're gonna get hurt!

Ray grabs hold of Robbie and pulls him roughly avay from the
convoy, stopping hin by the side of the road.

RAY
You know what, the sixteon year old

They're still moving, and in the background we can see Rachel
running now, racing toward then.

ROBBIE
Why don’t you just tell us the truth?
You have no idea which way to go. You

Mom is there, and if we find Mom you can
dump us on her and you'll only hava to
worry about yourself, which is oxactly
the way you lika it. Admit it, Ray, at
least I'll respect you.

The convoy ROARS avay, a cloud of dust receding on the horigon as
the convoy fades away to the south.

Rachel, who's nearly hysterical, catches up to Ray and Robbie and
SLAMS into Robbie, hitting him with balled-up fists.

RACHEL
Don't you leave me, don't you do that!
Don't you ever do that to me!

ROBBIE
Rachel, stop, hey, ow!

RACHEL
You can't leave, you can't just run

This, more than anything, makes Robbie feel terrible.

ROBBIE
I’m sorry. Rachel, I'm sorry.

He picks her up and carries her back toward the car, murmuring
softly to her to calm hor down.

And you know, it doesn't make Ray feel any too good either. He
watches his kids walk avay from him, feels horrible. worthless.

eyes are droopy.

Robbie is back to obsessively tuning the radio, but the digital

anything to stop on.

Until, suddenly, it stops, way up on the dial, 108.6.

bags of possessions, all walking in the same diraction.

Ray doesn't vake up. Robbie's vhite-knuckle on the wheel. In

reflected off hor face, there is a growing stream of displaced

at this point, but it's swift and dangerous. Just a mila or two
to the north, we can sao the massive spans of the great bridge Ray
had hoped to make it to, but without a car the ferry is now their
only hope to gat across.

Might has fallen, and the rain drissles to a stop. Tha MUSIC they
heard is louder here, played through the boat's tinny speakers,
perhaps to soothe the panicky crovd. A FERRY WORKER is SHOUTING
te the crowd through cupped hands.

FERRY WORKER
Please move forward calmly... there ia
room for everyone, and the boat can make
more than one trip... Please, move
forward calmly...

 

For the most part, the massage is gotting through. The crowd is
huge, but the boat is too, and there's no real sense of urgency.
The further they get downhill from the road, the more the
shooting at the car is left behind then.

As the crowd thickens, they notice people holding up hand-drawn
fliers, showing pictures of loved ones, searching for tho
missing. Light poles are plastered with similar fliors, and
since the power's out, they'ra all made by hand, with real
photographs taped to them.

A DINGIEG sound gets their attention and the crowd stops, looking
around. A set of railroad crossing barriers descends right in
front of them and, looking down, they realize a set of railroad
tracks runs between them and the ferry landing.

The crowd looks around, waiting for the train to come, and it
arrives suddenly, all at once, barreling toward tham at a hundred
miles an hour.

And it's on fire.

    

A shocked silence falls over the crowd as the burning passenger

train flies past them, a runaway, flames spewing from every

window, completely out of control. Wo sign of life is visible

vithins and, as quickly as it appearod, it flies past them,
around a bend in a puff of smoke.

WITH A TRANSISTOR RADIO has roplaced the battery and got it

working again, unfortunately there's nothing bat STATIC ali over

We start in close on the dial as it twists through the stations,
finding no information there. Pulling up from it, we follow Ray,
Rachel and Robbie as they move through the crowd, down the
hillside toward the dock. As they go they overhear murmurs,
vhisperings, snatches of conversations, the only information
anybody can glean about what exactly is going on:

OLDER MAH

I heard. The U.8. ly, South America

We were outside Albany, the planes flow

The Worried Father, who's been nodding, listening, turns away to
his Wife, away from the Informative Guy.

Ray notices Rachel, who's vastly concerned by all the
conversations going on around them. He draws hor attention:

Rach? Rachel, Mook... we'xe getting on
the boat... we're gonna make it.

Rachel lifts her head off his shoulder and turns around, sees
that they are, indeed, getting on the boat. This soema to help.

Ray kisses hor on the forehead and wipes avay her tears.

RAY (cont‘d)
Nothing bad is gonna happen to you. I
promise, Sweetie.

Rachel nods, calming. Next to them, a MOTHER carrying a THREE
YBAR OLD is feeding a cereal bar to him. sho notices Rachal
looking at the bar. she whispers in the Throa Year Old's ear, he
looks up at Rachel too.

The Mother takes the cereal bar, breaks it in half and holds it
out to Rachel.

Rachel suiles and takes it. Ray looks at the Mother, grateful,
almost overwhelmed by the tiny gesture. He nods at her, she
smiles back.

Ray looks at Robbie, who is noxt to him. He gives him a wink.
Robbie grina tightly, oxhales, calming. They've made it. This
far, anyway.

Rachel turns back, to rest her head on her father's shoulder,
chewing contentedly on the cereal bar. A flock of seagulls flies
low over them, and Rachel's eyes follow them as they head up the
embankment.

She seos somothing behind them and her eyes narrow.
She lifts her head. She cocks it sideways -- huh?

Ray turns, and does a double take looking at the crowd, as ha sees
a familiar face -- it's the Bartender from the bar at the
beginning, the woman in her late thirties. she's across the
crowd from him, maybe twonty yards, clutching the hand of a NINE
YBAR OLD BOY.

  

Ray waves a hand in surprised greeting, she recognizes him and
emiles. Ray starts to say something, but is interrupted by
Rachel -~

RACHEL
The trees are funny.

She's looking back up the hill.

Ray turns away from the Bartender, to follow Rachel's up
at the top of the embankment, there is a row of tall trees, the
forest runs all the way to the Highlands Road, which is what they
drove on,

 

Tho seagulls aro darting into the trees, up on the highlands,
which do indeed look funny. They seem to be breathing, a strange
mist emanating from inside them.And they're moving. But moving
forward, in a most un-treelike manner. ‘Three of then, anyway.

Ray's face goos white, fifty heads around him turn --
~~ AND A TRIPOD STEPS OUT OF THE FOREST.

Yor a moment, absolutely everything stops, no sound, no movement,
no nothing, and the Tripod just stands there, its head-like top
staring down at the crowd as it swarns toward the forry boat,
emanating clouds of vapor as it did in the street back in Ray's
neighborhood.

Robbie and Rachel, who never saw the Tripod back on Ray's block,
stare at it, horror-struck.

The seagulls swarm around the head of the Tripod like moths
around a flame.

On tha dock, panic hits. Ray turns back to where the Bartendor
was, but all he sees is the whites of her wide-open eyes as she
and her gon are swept away by the panicking crowd, which surges
forward, pushing to got onto the boat. The Captain hits the
engines, they ROAR.

And the Tripod, rather than immediately beginning the fight,
turns its head slightly and omits an inhuman ory, a MECBANICAL
BELLOW that rips over tho landscape and achoas all the way across
the river and washes back off the opposite bank:

“OLEA!"
om TRE DOCK, 80

the crowd surges forward onto the boat. Ray, holding Rachel,
winces in pain as he tries to keep her from being crushed.

Rachel begins to panic, and Ray makes a spaco around hor with his
arms, the way Robbie did in tho car.

RAY
This is your space, you hear ne?! This
4s your space, nobody's coming in here,
I will protect youl

Robbie, caught in the orush of people, actually loses touch with
the ground, his feot 1ift right up off the decking and he moves
forward as part of a massive organism, no control at all.

Mo SCREAMS for his fathor, Ray SCREAMS back, but thera‘s nothing
they can do to stay near each other, they're lost in the flood.

Iu THE RIVER, a1

the massive propellers of the forry boat CHURN the water as thoy
start to turn, but they're digging too hard in an area that's too
shallow, and thoy throw up an enormous spray of mud and silt that
flies everywhora.

The boat lurches forward, throving up a huge rooster tail of
river mud.

The roar ramp of the ferry boat starts to riso up, spilling
whoover was on it into the boat, and blocking tho way for whoover
was still on the dock.

the still-tied aft ropes on the boat pull tight, and with a
horrible GROAHING they rip the pilings out of the riverbed.

The massive boat moves out fast, a dozen people clinging to the
half-raised rear ramp, suspended over the churning propellers.

Robbie leaps forward, onto the roof of the rearmost car, and gots
himself up noar the top of the ramp. He hauls poople onboard, one
after another. Some slip and fall into the freezing river belev,
but Robbie 8 easily 4 half dozen.

sudden shift in the water boneath them.

Ray turns and looks over the side. The river is churning,
something's coming up from the river bottom, and as he looks --

-- THE HEAD OF A TRIPOD BREAKS THE RIVER SURFACE.

Everyone on board SCREAMS and the ferry boat tilts sharply to the
side, unbalanced by the sudden depression in the vater.

The Tripod rises, higher and highor.

Tha deck of tho ferry is at a thirty degree angle now, cars begin
to slide, tumbling toward the railing.

Ray grabs hold of Robbie, who's still working to help poople on

But Ray doesn't hava time to disci it, cars are SLAMMIHG into

@ MAN teoters for balance, one of the last left behind. suddenly
black snakelike tentacles wrap around his mid-section. He looks
down in horror --

-- and is swept up into the air. Following him, we look up and
see that the tentacles have come from underneath the Tripod
that's standing in the river.

The Man is swopt aloft, and around behind the Tripod, which is
where wo lose sight of him. We're unsure where he's going or vhat
it wants with hin.

I8 THE RIVER, 963

the current is strong, it grabe hold of Ray and the kids and
sweeps them away from the sinking ferry boat, out inte the middle
of the river. They GASP and struggle in the current.

Ray looks back, over his shoulder, at the ruins of the dock,
where the lead Tripod now unfurls its heat-ray and trains it on
the sinking ferry boat and the hundreds of innocent people
swarming on and around it.

 

The Tripod points the disk at tho dock and there is a flash, a
silont brightnoss like cummer lightning. waves like rippling
heat distort the air between the Tripod and the dock, then --

GO UNDER!

-- the three of them gulp air and kick down under the surface.

we see the explosion of flame that means the ferry boat has been
incinerated. It's muffled under here, and seen through the prism
of dark river water, but still horrifying.

they bob up again, boyond the ferry boat nov, pulled hard by the
river's current, more than halfway across.

‘The Tripods mova forward into the river, their swarms of
tentacles pluck SCREAMING PASSENGERS right off the deck of the
burning, sinking boat. Where they go after they're swept up into
the air, we still can't see.

Ray and the kids continue to be swept downstream, just away from
tthe chaos, which is good because --
82.
CONTINUED: 98

 

-- the Tripods fire again. The h ays sweep in unison across
the center of tho river, directly into the swarm of SCREAMING
nnocents.

A gigantic cloud of steam rises up from the touch of the hest-ray
on the river, strange objects start leaping out of the water and
into the aix, flopping all around Ray and the kids. They're
fish.

And Af we wonder why they're leaping, we quickly put it together
as the river around Ray end the Kido ROILS, seven to eight foot
waves wagh toward them, and a huge cloud of steam washes over
them, obscuring all their vicion.

ROBBIE:
‘THE WATER!

RACHEL
IT'S BURNING ME!

RAY

SWIM FOR SHORE!

And they do, Ray grabbing Rachol and digging at the water with
everything he's got.

Behind them, the vast cloud of steam still blocks much of the
destruction behind, but they can hear SCREAMS, hear the HISSING
and BOILING of the water, and see the FLASHES of the heat-ray as
it's applied again and again.

 

They're noar the shore now, but a huge, bubbling wave of water is
washing straight towards them. The shore's just twenty feet
away, then ten, but the boiling wave is just behind tham too, the
water rises up --

-- they hurl thamselves onto the rivor bank --
Bx? FAR RIVERBANK WIGHT 99

-- and the tide of boiling water erupts in front of them, just
inches from their safe perch.

They lie there for a moment, scalded, catching their breath. But
with the SOUNDS of the destruction in the river --

RAY
Koop moving!

-- he drags the kids to their fect and they begin to olimb the far
bank, towards higher ground.

Ray drags the kids upward, upward, two hundred yards, to the
brink of the embankment on the far sido of the river from the
dock.

Finally, they collapse to the ground and look down at tho
wholesale slaughter they so narrowly escaped.

It's a view of staggoring destruction, and the first wide shot of
the mayhem that we've sean so far.

Through clouds of steam and billowing smoke, we see it all -- the
flaming dock (the boat has sunk by now), the drowning victins,
and the hideous Tripods, wading methodically through the river,
directing the heat-ray at any survivors as they make their way
upstream.

 

Raising his gaze, Ray looks up to the highlands, where TEN
THOUSAND REFUGEES are still flooding down the main road that
leads to the ferry dock, funneled directly into the massacre by
half a dozen Tripods that stalk behind them, spreading
destruction.

On the horizon beyond, fires dot the landscape as far as Ray can
see, and to the north, an even worse omen --

-- the sky is alive with yet another lightning storm, which will
birth more of these murdering machines. it's the rout of
edvilization... the massacre of mankind.

Ray pulls his two children close, their burned, soaking bodies
huddled next to his, quivering with fear, but still alive.

Brilliant flashes of light follow moments later, lighting up the
gathering night, and hollow BOOMS come a few seconds later.

Robbie, who has stayed on his feet, lets out a WAR WHOOP and takes
off running in the direction the fighters went.

RAY

He takes off after him, dragging Rachel by the hand.

And they're not alone -- a group of SIX OR SEVEN COLLEGZ-AGE KIDS
emerge from the treo line to the east, following tho path the
jets took, waving their arms in the air.

Ray notices then, looks around more ag he runs toward the
hilltop. A FAMILY OF FOUR now emerges from the back of a van that
was nose-down in the ditch on the side of the road, it had looked
empty end abandoned but was really a hiding placa.

 

And there's more -- from the old Victorian house on the ern
horizon, a BURLY MAN of about fifty comes cautiously outside,
clutching a rifle, head darting from side to sido.

Tho countryside, which seemed so abandoned a few minutes ago, is
suddenly alive with survivors coming out of hiding.

Ahead, Robbie races toward the hilltop, a couple hundred yards
ahead, rimmed by tall grass. Ray keeps moving after him, one
hand holding onto Rschel's arm firmly.

clamped over their ears.

Rachel SHOUTS somathing at Ray, but he can't hear her over the
still-echoing blast. He SHOUTS something back, same story.

He grabs hold of her again and pulls her up the hill, she's
SHOUTING her objections, but Robbie's still moving ahead of than,
eravling toward the top of the hill.

Rachel nods frantically and digs herself into the hilleide, hands

Ext BILLTOP WIGHT 106

Ray cravls toward the top of the rise as fast as he can, closing
in on Robbie, who is headed for a GROUP OF SOLDIERS who are

crouched et the rim of the hill, staring dovn into the valley
below. The noise up here is deafening, two of the Soldiers ara
watching the battle below through binoculars, two more SHOUT into
radios, but wo can’t hear a word they're gaying.

 

@ command post up on the ridge, the Soldiers are using laser
targeting (for the fighter jets) and reconnaissance gear.

The battle itself 4a obscured by the tall waving grass, a thick
gray smoke that billovs in over everything, and blinding flashes
that accompany the constant explosions coming from below.

    

 

Ray reaches the still-moving Robbie and hurls himself at him,
tackling him ten feet short of the top of the hill. He crashes to
the ground on top of him as the four fighter jets that flow
overhead carlier circle back for a strafing run, coming in low.

As tho fighting rages betwoon the Army and the invaders, another
battle rages betweon Ray and Robbie, as Ray SHOUTS in Robbie‘s
ear, pleading with him not to go over the hill. Robbie twists and
thrashes in response, trying to escape his father.

We can‘t hear anything thoy say, as MORTARS are exploding,
there's densa GUNFIRE, SHOUTING and SCREAMING from the battle
raging over the hilltop. (For suggested Ray speech, sea APPENDIX

Ray and Rachel pull their palms avay fron their cara, their hands

Ray SCREAMS for Robbie a few times more, open-mouthed, desperate,
but we can't hear it.

Then, suddenly, the ROARING battle sounds fade, and there's only
a strange silence coming from the valley.

Ray moves as fast and as hard ag he can, knocking them to the
ground, rolling tham in the dirt. Now sound comes back, and with
@ vengeance. HORRIBLE SCREAMS, explosions of flame.

Ray looks up, toward the top of the hill.

RAY (cont'd)

Now military vehicles come pouring over the hilltop, headed back
this way, fast, and then soldiers on foot, running for their
lives in a massive, chaotic retreat.

And then, in pursuit -- THE TOPS OF THREE TRIPODS appear ovor the
crest of the hill.

Ray and Rachel freeze in momentary panic, just as the FOUR
PIGHTER JETS reappoar, SCREAMING ovar the horizon to save the
day.

Ray and Rachel duck down, hands over their heads, and through the
blowing woeds, Ray seos four small projectiles HI88 from beneath
the planes’ vings.

The micailos head straight for the Tripods, but when they're a
good fifty yards away, the missiles explode harmlessly in nid-

He hurries down the stairs, out of breath hinsolf, and squats in
front of tham. The placo is lit by a single hurricane lamp on top
of a red cooler.

What about you?

Ray just looks at him, unable to speak, his eyes big and empty.
cur TO:
mt OLD HOUSE ~ CELLAR SIGHT 118

Later that night, maybe the middle of the night. The cellar is
lit only by the tiny flame enduring in the hurricane lamp.

On one side, there's a small cot, and Rachel ds lying on it, undor
a couple blankets. Ray's crouching boside it, stroking her hair
gently, WHISPERING to her. Her ayes ara heavy, thoy want to be
slosed, but she’s trying like hell to keep them open. They're in
the middie of a conversation.

  

‘RACHEL
What do you mean? He got a ride? From
who?
‘RAY
Shhh, close your eyes.
RACHEL
With the army man?
RAY
He's he's gonna meet us, honey. In

    

Boston. At Mom's. Close your eyes. Let
‘am close. I'm right hero...

She forces her eyes open again, WHISPERS to him.

RACHEL
Where do you think Mom is right this
minute?

RAY
Waiting for us, I think she and Tim are
in Boston at Grandma's house, and
they're all waiting for us.

RACHEL
Are you sure?

I think they can't sleep, because
thay‘re so Worried about us, so they're
sitting in the kitchen, and they're
desoking | that awful tea Grandma makes,
‘re counting every minute until
ye us again,

He reaches down to give her hand a squooze, notices she's
clutching something there. It yellow third-place ribbon, the
one she tried to get him to notice earlier. she'd stuffed it in
her pocket.

  

   

Ray opens her fingers, pulls the ribbon out.
RAY (cont'd)
This yours? pid you win this?

(neds sleopily)
I won third place.
It's posutiter ys What'd you win it for?
RACHEL
{yawaing)

Walk, trot and canter. They call it
hunter-jumper.

RAY
Well, I'm very impressed. I'm... I'm
proud of you.
That's what you say to a kid in these circumstances, right?
Rachel omileo, starts to reply --
RACHEL
Sing me Lullaby & Goodnight.

RAY
TI don't know that one.
RACHEL
Sing me Bushabye Mountain.
RAY
I don’t know that one either.
She turns her head avay, disappointed. Ray thinks for a moment,

then starts to sing softly, huskily. It's "Little Deuce Coupe,”
the Beach Boys song.
92.
118 CONTINUED: (2) 118

After a few lines, Rachel is asleep. Ray furrows his brov
slightly, that was odd, how quickly she fell asleep, but he puts
one hand on her stomach -~ sho's still breathing.

He pulls the blanket up around her chin and crosses the basement.
The Burly Man is sitting on mall folding camp chair next to the
cooler, the rifle over his knees. He gestures to another chair,
which he has unfolded for Ray.

Ray sits heavily, close to collapse, and drops his head in his
hands, The Burly Man reaches out and nudgas him with the baok of
one hand and Ray looks up ~- he's offering a glass half-filled
with a clear liquid.

  

  

BURLY MAN
Peach sobnappo. Disgusting, I know.
Found a whole case of this shit.

RAY

 

Thank you.

Ray takes a sip. Tho Burly Man nods, knocks his back. He
breathes heavily, labored most of the time, maybe he's asthmstio.

BURLY MAH
I’m sorry about your son.

Ray nods, ‘They drink in silence for a moment. Then:

RAY
Did you... lose anyone?

BURLY MAH
All of ‘em.

Ho looks away. That seoms to be all he's going to say about that.
Ray respects it. The Burly Man holds out a hand.

BURLY MAN (cont'd)

He looks at Ray, but when Ray meets his eye, he fidgets. Maybe he
didn‘t find it empty.

OGILVY (cont'd)
What?

RAY
Didn't say a word.

Ray's eyas drop down, and for the first time he notices the largo
hunting knife Ogilvy wears strapped to his ankle.

OGILVY
Got water, food enough for weeks.
You're welcome to stay. Both of you.

RAY
Thank you. I gotta sloep...

Ho stands up.

OGILVY
Those machines, those Tripods they
got...

Ray turns back. Ogilvy shakes his head in dire admiration.

OGILVY (cont'd)
Buried ‘em right under our feet. Since
before the first people were here.
They've been planning this for a million
years. We're beat to shit.

RAY
Please keep your voice down.

OGILVY
Think about it, they defeated the
greatest power in the world in a couple
days, Walked right over us. And the
aro only the first, they'll keep comin:
This isn’t a war, any more than there's
a war between men and maggots.

   

 

   

RAY
Then what is it?

OGILVY
It's an extermination.

He pours himself soma more schnapps. Ray nods. Again, he tries
to walk avay. Again, Ogilvy won't let him.

RAY
Of course I'm afraid.

How York?

OGILVY
You know the poople that make it? the

eyes open, that keap looking at you,
keep thinking, they'ro the ones who
survive. ‘t losa our heads, Ray.
Running, what'll kill you. And
I'm dead set on living.

{laughs bitterly)
“Dead sot on living.”

  

He finishes his schnappa again and pours himsalf some more. Ray
watches him. This is starting to be a concarn.

Scmewhere far off in the distance, there is a hollow BOOM.

RAY
Thank you for taking us in.

Ray goes to the other sido of the basement, where Rachel is
asleap. He lies down on the floor next to her cot, makes a pillow
of his Jacket.

More hollow BOOMS, except they're slightly closer.

Ogilvy, still sitting with his back to him and faintly
giinoustted by the hurricane lamp, calls out in a normal, too-
voice.

OGILVY
Not gonna be exterminated!

Ray closes his eyes, but a few chunks of earth and plaster fall
from the ceiling and land on the floor around hin.

Ho opens hia eyes. More debris wafts down onto hig face. Ray
sits up and looks over at Ogilvy, who turns around to face him, a
mad grin on his face.

can figure it out but we can't?

    

 

He comes over and albows Ray in the ribs, a hard, macho gesture.
Ray GROANS in pain, his ribs are probably fractured.

Prom just outside, a loud, rhythmic POUNDING begins, like the
sound of a factory coming back to life after lunch hour. The
house above them SHUDDERS. Ray geta to his feet, a horrible
thought growing in hie mind.

OGILVY (contd)
It's okay.

He leans forward, opens the door on the hurricane lamp, and PUFFS
out the flame, plunging the basement into near-darkness.

OGILVY (cont‘d)
Have a look.

He stands, still clutching the rifle, and seurries across the
room, gesturing to Ray to follow. Ho climbs up on an overturned
erate, onto a small ledge built into the wall.

When he climbs on it, his face is right at window level. A board
has beon cut to fit the window space and lid into place, now
Ogilvy slides it back slightly so he can see outside.

Putting a finger to his lips, a signal to Ray to keep quiet, he
hops off the wall and gesture: Ray to climb up.

  

Ray does, with dread, Ogilvy gestures -- look through the slit.
THROUGH THE SLIT, 1s

Ray can the open area to the side of the house. But it isn't
open fiold any more.

TWO TRIPODS have made their encampment in the field, and as Ray
watches a THIRD TRIPOD strides out from the trees, calling to the
others in its familiar mechanical tone.

 

“ULLAI™

Ray's face snaps away from the window in horror. Ogilvy, who
seemed to know about this, seems unconcerned.

those things are on.

Be sourri the basement, climbs a ladder on the other
tide, and pushon aside ancther piace of plywood that he's used to
obscure the window over there.

   

Again, he gestures to Ray, who races silently across the room and
up the ladder.

THROUGH THE SECOND SLIT, 421
Ray sees ANOTHER TRIPOD on this side of the house, and ag he

watch its GIANT MECHANICAL LEGS stride right past the vindow
and stop.

 

 

With an otherworldly GROAN, the legs contract into themselves,
lowering the "head" of the Tripod down to ground level.

There's a FLASH of brilliant light from within the head of the
fripod that momentarily illuminates the fields around tho house,
and in that flash we sae equipmont, dug-out pits, a bivousc --
elear evidence that this 1s, and has beon, an alien oncaspment.

In their hurry to get inoido, Ray and Rachel didn't notice it ell
before, but they are now living in a house taken over.

BACK IH THE BASEMENT, 122
uy leaps off the ladder and Jands in front of Ogilvy, vho's

at showing off the true nature of their location. Ray
grabo him by the shirt, drags his face right up to his.

 

RAY
You knew?! Aro you insane?! How could
you bring us here?!

OGILVY
So we could fight ‘em together, Ray!
Bow wo'ro the ones coming up from
underground. And whon the tima's right,
we'll take them by surprise, the way

Ray looks at him, realising too late this guy's lost it.

Ray's aye is pooring out through the basement slit, looking
furtively from side to side. Phe sounds of HEAVY MACHINERY can
be heard bohind us, the rhythmic, pounding drone of a factory.
Tho shadows of tall, moving shapes play across the house.

INT OLD HOUSE - CELLAR DAY 124

Ray slides the piace of wood back into place and hops off the
narrow ledgo. He's upsat, didn't like vhat he sav, clearly
they‘re still hemmed in by the Tripods. The POUNDING MACHINERY
ig deop and penetrating here in the basement, and it will hammer
avay constantly the entire time they're here.

Up near the window, he aces the tendrils of a batch of red weed
growing around the edge of the window, making their way into the
basement.

  

He reaches up and RIPS them off. They're tough, sinewy, it takes
a few pulls.

He leoks across tho room, sees Rachel still asleep on the cot.

Ogilvy 49 back on the camp chair, his rifle across his logs,
rocking back and forth slightly, watching Ray's every mova.

With a dull SCRAPE, ho strikes a match from a book of matches.
holds a straight pin in tho other hand and pi it back and
forth through the flame, sterilizing it. Rachel stares at him
with wide, teary ayes, fixed on the pin. she's got her left hand
balled up in a fist and is clutching it to herself.

RAY

(whispering)
It's infected. It's got to come out or
it'll just got worse.

 

 

Reluctantly, Rachel opens ber hand and wo got a look at hor palm --
the sliver she got a fav days ago is indeed infected, the skin is
puffy, red and angry all around it. Ray moves the pin closer.

RACHEL
Do you have to do that?

Ray puts down the pin, reaches down carefully, and pinches the
and of the protruding splinter.

RAY
Wot anymora. Look, the infection pushed
it out a little.

He pulls it the rest of the way out and Rachel snatches her hand
back happily.

RACHEL
Told you. It wasn't supposed to be
there, so my body got rid of it.

RAY
Yeoh. It did, didn’t it.

RACHEL
(pause, then)
How long are we going to stay here?

RAY
Mot long. Wo nead to wait for the right
moment, and then we're going to leave
and find anotbar place to stay.

RACHEL

Of course wo are. But in the meantime,

OGILVY

Leave? What's the matter with you,
we're gonna fight. I already started a
tunnel, you wanna see it?

RAY
No, I don't want to see your tunnel.

He goes across the room to the other slit and slides it open.
Nothing encouraging there aither. More red weed drips down the
wall here, Ray rips that off too.

OGILVY

What we've got to do is get to the
cities, We'll have our own tunnels
there, ready-made. The subways, seo
what I'm saying?

RAY
Keep your voice dovn.

OGILVY
We can hide a whole army down there.
We'll go underground, stage attacks at
night. We're the Resistance, Ray. They
can't occupy this country, occupations
always fail, history taught us that a
thousand times. This is our land, wo
eat it, we breathe it, only we can live
on it. They can't survive here, they
weren't built for it, they-

Ray sworves over in front of him and bends down, holding a finger
up in front of Ogilvy's face. He speaka in a whisper (as ho will
the whole time they're in the collar).

RAY
Keep. Your voice. Down.

Ogilvy stares right back at him, with meaning. Ray looks down.
The barrel of Ogilvy's gun is pointed at him. He pushes it avay
with one finger and leans in to Ogilvy's ear.

nr CELLAR NIGHT 126

Nighttime. still in the cellar. The red wood Ray tore down has
grown back in from around the corners of the windows. ‘Tho
rhythmic POUNDING goes on.

Water has pooled in the basement from a dripping spigot on the
far side. Rachel is huddled in a dry corner, her hends clamped
over her ears, going quictly insana from the constant noise.

Ogilvy comes over to her, slides down onto the floor next to her.
He's half drunk.

OGILVY
You mise your mommy?

Rachal just looks back at him, scarod, doasn't answor. Ray, who
is across tha cellar getting soma food onto a plate for Rachel,
notices Ogilvy talking to her.

OGILVY (cont‘d)
I had a girl nearly your age. If
anything happens to your daddy, I'12
take care of you,

Ray grabs Ogilvy by the collar and turns him away from Rachel,
but does sc subtly, so his daughter doesn't notice the force
behind the gesture.

RAY
(low voice)
You've got nothing to say to hor.
Understand?

126 CONTINUED: 126

RAY (cont'd)
You want to talk to somebody, you got a
question, you ask mo.

Ogilvy looks at him, measures whether a fight with Ray is a good
or bad thing.

OGILVE
Yeah, I got a question. What exactly is
your plan, Ray? 1 mean, I know what I’m
gonna do, what about you? You gonna
just sit here, wait for them to come get
you? Is that it? I that what you've
got up your sleeve?

He gets up and grabs his wheelbarrow, goes noisily across the
basement to go back to work.

‘RAY
Reap the noise down.”

OGILVY
{almost shouting)
Maybe you want to be caught... couple
days hiding in a basement, too much for
you, I bat.

RAY
shut up!

Suddenly, the pounding stops. It's quiet out there now, VERY
quiet. As if they heard something.

RAY (cont'd)
Listen! It stopped.

But Ogilvy pays it no mind, he keops talking in a normal voice.

oGrLvy
Probably turn yourself right in, that's
what you'll do. Wonder what you ever
did before they camo along and changed
your life,

Ray goes over in front of him, gots right in his face.

RAY
Listen! shut up!

oorLvy
Maybe you'll be okay. Maybe you'll get
lucky, they'll take you as a pet.

RACHEL
Dadi
102.
126 CONTINUED: (2) 126

Ray turns, sees what Rachol is pointing at. At one of the slits,
there is movement, the plywood is being rattled.

 

OGILVY
You know, feed you, throw a ball for you
to fateh, get all sentimental over the
pet boy they love so much until he the
day he bites somebody and they have to
pot him down.

Abruptly, the plywood flies off the slit. Punched by something
from the other side, it breaks the glass as woll, chunks of it
SMASH and CLATTER on the cellar floor.

They all freeze, dead silent, even Ogilvy, as seething moves
through the window.

It's dark in hore, lit only by the irregular light coming in from
outside, so it's hard to see much, but what it looks like is
something about the size of a football, but sharp-edged,
triangular, a glowing searchlight at ite tip. It's a probo, the
kind they saw going into the suburban house earlier. The only
sound in the basament is the steady drip-drip-drip of the leaky
spigot in the far wall.

It slithers into the basement, looking around, almost like a
head, turning from side to side, sliding alongside objects
+ gathering data.

 

Ray looks at Ogilvy, to make sure he's still silent. wo is, but
he's algo looking up at the wall nearby thom with intent. Ray
follows hia g

Ogilvy's looking at an axe that's hanging on the wall.

  

Ogilvy glances at Ray, looks back up at the axe, then back at Ray.
He mouths words, silently.

OGILVY (cont'd)
(I CAN GET ITI)

Ray understands, all right, but shakes his head no, vehemently.
The probe moves down to ground level and cozes across the floor,
searching, searching. It draws closer to them. Ray catches eyes
with Rachel, who's terrified, and mouths words to her --

(D0 ROT MOVE.)

Just bofore it reaches them, the probe finds a door slightly ajar
(it leads to a root cellar) and it passes through there.

 
126

103.
CONTINUED: (3) 126

As soon as it's out of sight, Ogilvy straightens up to grab tho
axe off the wall. Ray stands and grabs hold of his arm to stop
him, but Ogilvy swings an elbew into Ray's broken ribs, hard.

Ray orumples to the floor in pain, is dying to scream, but
manages to stifle it.

Ogilvy snatches the axe and crouches down again, raising it,
waiting for the probe to come back into the room.

From the floor, Ray looks around frantically and spots a largo
old mirror leaning up against the wall nearby. In great pain, he
raises himself up on one elbow and crawls forward to it.

He grabs hold of the mirror's gilt edges and drags it slevly,
silently over in front of himself and Rachel. Ogilvy, nearby,
still has the azo raised in readiness.

Ray HISSES for hia attention, imploring the man to coma behind
the mirror. Ogilvy shakes his head no, but Ray mouths silently.

RAY (CONT'D)
(ROT HOW. LATER. PLEASE, WOT HOW.)

Ogilvy dabates, still leaving himself out in the open.

RAY (cont'd)
{WE WILL GET THEM LATER. I PROMISE.)

The probe, perhaps hearing them, pulls out of the root celler and
back into the main room, just as Ogilvy reluctantly decides to
scamper behind the mirror.

The probe senses the movement and darts quickly across the roon,
bumping gently into the surface of the mirror.

Behind the mirror, Ray, Rachel, and Ogilvy all remain frozen.

The probe's head recoils from the mirror, seems to tilt its hesd
in curiosity. The mirror fogs right in front of it, maybe the
Probe expels C02, like a breathing organism.

It studies the mirror for one more moment, then with a piercing
uigs, it's recalled, slithering back ac: the cellar at top
speed and whipping up and out through the now-broken window.

   

After a moment, the RHYTHMIC POUNDING of the machinery resumes.

Ray drags himself into a sitting position, leaning against the
wall, aursing his ribs, Rachel at his side. Ogilvy sits cross-
legged, staring at him, still holding the axe.
104.
126 «CONTINUED: (4) 126

oGILvy
I got my doubts about you, Mister.

Ray stares him down. He's about to get up and take Rachel back to
the other aide of tha basement, but he freezes, staring down at
the wator that's pooled on the basement floor. here are ripples
in it, little wavelets flowing toward hin.

Reflexively, he hunches hunch down in the hiding place again,
listening. The ripples get bigger, something is moving on the
far side of the basemont. Rachel looks up at Ray, her eyes
pleading -- “what is it?” Ray shakes his head, "don’t move.“

They listen. Across the room, they can hear 4 LABORED BREATHING,
thick, short, wat breaths. won-human breaths.

Ray moves, slowly, raising his head to peor betwoon some laundry
that hangs from a clothesline overhead.

THROUGH THE LAUNDRY,

he gots his firat (and only) good look at the rounded bulk of one
of the CREATURES.

It's about five fect long, dense, cluglike in appearance. It has
three stubby limbs, all underneath it, and a long sot of tendrils
around its “mouth,” similar to the ones that danglo boneath the
belly of the ?ripod it's operating. Its skin is somewhat
translucent, its internal organs visible through it.

 

Its “month is shoved over the dripping water spigot on the far
wall, SLURPING at the pracious liquid. its broathing is very
heavy and slow, it seoms 111 or incapacitated in coma way. As Ray
watches PWO MORE of the things slither through the window
oponing, their body mass streamlining to get through the narrow
space, then re-expanding as they land on the basement floor.

As the first creature sucks at the water pipe, the second goss to
it, perhaps to check on it. the third creature rumages

tho stuff on the basement floor, using its tendrils to dip inte a
cardboard box filled with photographs.

It scatters most of them across the basomont floor, but finds one
that might be of interest. It passes it over to tho second
creature, which takes it from it and examines it.

BEHIND THE HANGING LAUNDRY,
Ray holds his breath. Ogilvy, who is full of tough talk when not

faced with danger, is froson in abjoct horror. Rachol,
thankfully, has her view obscured and can't seo what's going on.

the creatures just start to move across the basement, toward the
three humans crouched in the far corner, when -- ULLA! -~ a
mechanical cry from the Tripod outside sounds. The three bulky
creatures move quickly and with sudden power, even nimble, their
stubby logs propelling them rapidly across the floor, up the
wall, and out the window, to rejoin their ship.

IN HIS HIDING PLACE,

 

Ray exhales deoply and turns around to face Rachel. He looks
down at his hands, which have boon balled up into fists. Ht
forces himself to unclench. There ara four red gaghes in each
palm, where his nails dug into bis akin in fear.

   

CUP TO:
mt OLD HOUSE - CELLAR DAY 127

The next day. Or maybe tho one after that. They're blending
together now. One thing we know for sure -- there's a hell of a
lot more red woed in here than their used to be. It fringes the
windows, of course, but it's dripping down the walls too.

Ray, who's staring up at one of the windows, does a double take.
Through a gap in the frame, there thin red mist coming into
the basement, like gas ping through the cracks.

   

 

Ogilvy's across the room, staring out ono of the slits.

Ray stands and goes to window where the red mist is filtering in.
He holds out a hand. Tho red mist covers his hand and he pulls it
back, looks at it. Rubs his fingars together.

The red gubstance smears, and it looks and feels unploagantly
familiar. Deep down, Ray probably knows what it is but doosn’t
want to admit it.

He looks up at the wall, where the red mist has settled over a
patch of red weed, which is twitching and growing excitedly
underneath it.

Suddenly, from the other sido of the room, Ogilvy amits a stunned
car (whlch he faile to muto) and falls backwards-

Ray leaps forward and catches him before he tumbles off the
narrow ledge, preventing the racket that would have come from him
bitting the floor.
RAY
What is it?! what?

OGILVY
The... that thing! It... dt...

Ray scrambles up to the ledge and peors out through the slit.
THROUGH THE SLIT, 128

he sees the logs of one of the Tripods as it returns. This Tripod
has a different feature than wo‘ve seen before, a device that
extends from ite shell, a large metallic basket of some sort,
affixed to its back.

Ray squints, trying to figure out this new development, but
Ogilvy's hands are on him, pulling at him, to gat at the slit.

OGILVY
Lat me seel

Rey swats him away like a fly, looks back through the slit.

Suddenly, from the underbelly of the Tripod's “head,” half a
doren vhiplike tendrils shoot out and extend to about a hundred
feet in length ach.

They snake around, up to the basket on the back of the machine,
and slither ingide it. HUMAN SCREAMS come from inside.

RAY
Oh God...

The tendrils emerge from the basket, wrapped around the body of a
WAS TH BIS FORTIES. The Man is injured but still conscious,
SHRIERIRG.

‘The tendrils snap, hurling the Man to the ground just behind a
large pile of dirt, then they stiffen, pinning hin there, just
out of our sight.

The Tripod shifts so that it's standing directly over him, then a
thin pipette emerges from its base and shoots straight down, into
the earth where the man was screaming.

And ho stops screaming.

Phe tranglucent pipette turns rad ag blood flows up through it.

 

Ray GASPS, staring in horror. suddenly, from the back of the
Tripod, a thick red mist sprays out, covoring the field of red
wood below.

Ray whips away from the slit, horrified, and looks again at the

red mist coming through the window on the far side, and at the red
smear on his hand.

It's blood, human blood, and they're using it to fertilize the
red weed.

Hands shaking, Ray finds the piece of plywood and slides it back
into place, obscuring the window.

He looks across the room and sees Rachel, who's staring at him,
desperate for information (right, like he’s gonna tell her this).
Ogilvy is novhere to be found.

But suddenly there's a sharp SCRAPING sound from across the
basement. Loud, way too loud.

Ray loaps off the ledge and hurries across tho basement to tha
small root cellar that's off to one aide. Ho opens the door.

Ogilvy is inside, standing vaist doop in a hole, shovel in hand,

Ray grabs him by the arm roughly.

He jams the shovel into the ground, it CLANGS off a rock.

RAY
They'll hear you!

He reaches out to grab hold of tho chovol, to pull it avay from
Ogilvy, but the man swings it instead, catching Ray hard in the
aide of the neck.

the shovel.

OGILVY

Ray looks at him. Ogilvy has gone completely unhinged.
rer OLD HOUSE - CELLAR DAY 131

Ray comes out of the root cellar and into the basement, looking
around for something, searching, searching.

Rachel watches him, puzzled.
Outside, the SCREAMS and the CLANKING of machinery are louder
now, it's possible thoy haven't heard the sound of the digging in
the root cellar.
Yrom the other room, Ogilvy can be heard ranting, LOUD.
RACHEL
(a whisper)

Ray finds what he was looking for, or something close enough
anyway. It‘s an old tee shirt.
Be goes to Rachel and drops to his knees in front of her.
RACHEL (cont'd)
What are you doing?
‘RAY
No matter what you hoar, do not take
this off. Okay?

Rachel of course has no clue what he’s talking about, but she
nods anyway.

Ray reaches out and wraps the tee shirt around her head, tying it
firmly in the back.
109.
131 CONTINUED: 131

It's a blindfold.

Ray checks to make sure it's tight, then turns and hurries out of
frama.

We stay on Rachel's face, half-covered by the dirty tee shirt,
and see none of what follows, we only hear the sounds and see the
reactions on Rachel's obscured face.

  

First we hear the digging, louder than ever, and Ogilvy's
RANTING, coming from the other room, and his RASPY BREATHING,
louder than ever. Then footsteps, silent, swift ones as they
head toward him.

A door closes. Haybe the door to the root cellar? the digging
stops. Thero arc urgant, muffled sounds. More SHOUTING, Ogilvy
again, much too loud.

Then a silence, a long one, punctuated occasionally by slight
sounds of thrashing, and that breathing, still that RASPY
BREATHING, but it's all off screen and through a closed door, and
it's hard to tell.

A long moment goes by. Only silence.

And the BREATHING. Raspy, labored breathing, But only one
Person now.

A door CREAKS open. Then closes, very softly.
Footsteps again. Heavy BREATHING. Someone sliding to the floor.

Slowly, Rachel roaches up and pulls the blindfold from her eyes,
terrified at what she'll see.

She blinks at the light. On the far side of the basement, she

sees her father, slumped against the wall, a vacant expression on

Mie foce, broathing hard from the struggle. It vas bie breathing
heard.

He won't look at her.

Rachel turns toward the root cellar, sees the door hanging open a
few inches. And no sounds coming from inside it.

She crawls across the floor of the basement silently, and curls
up against her father. He puts one arm around her and pulls her
tight, but can't look at her.

Softly, Rachel starts to speak, through tears:

All the quiet that's been building in the cellar explodes in a
long, deafening SHRIEK as Rachel empties her lungs in terror.

The probe jerks back a foot or so, Ray tries to cover Rachel's
mouth, but this is it, she's snapping, she can’t take it anymore.
Ray lunges for the axe that's nearby and attacks the probe,
swinging wildly, making some contact.

   

 

Rachel, beyond reason, scrambles to her feet and takes off, up
the stairs that lead into the house.

RAY

But she's already gone, out of the basement, and Ray is delayed
by his battle with the probe. He lands a decisive blow and lops
the head off the thing, ite remnant withdraws quickly, back and
out through the window it came in. Ray takes off after Rachel.

Ray frooses, utterly terrified, and looks up. The Tripod is
standing right over him, that enormous, humanoid “head” that
makes up its top is stering down at him. A flock of black crovs
svarm around the head of the Tripod, and at this point we
understand why -- they're hoping for carrion.

Immediately, two grabbing tentacles sving down from the Tripod's
underbolly and WHIR through the air tovard Ray.

Ray lunges into the nearest cover --

The second tentacle SMASHES through the passenger side window,
and now he’s trapped, stuck between the two of them. Ray

flattens himself on the floor, as low as he can get, and’ the truck
suddenly jerks off the ground, lifted into the air by the
tentacles.

Zt sails through tho air, turns over throe times, and SMASHES
back down onto the ground, bouncing Ray off coiling and floor
like a rag doll.

As soon as he can breathe he sits up, looks out through the
smashed windshield -~

avay, at the adge of the field of red weed, SCREAMING.

RAY

But the Tripod sees her too, and gives up its attack on Ray. It
turns and hits the gas, enormous legs covering the ground batween
it and Rachel in a matter of seconds.

Ray kicks open the twisted door of the pickup truck and takes off
across the open space, toward Rachel.

But the Tripod has a head start and is a hell of a lot faster. It
reaches her, and tho next thing happens so fast it's hard to
comprohond -- the Tripod walks right over top of Rachel, four of

them earlier.

He races to it, rips the door open and searches through the
eharred interior. He finds an automatic pistol and a grenade
belt. Those'll do.

Ray takes off into a vast field of red weed, chasing after the

Tripod. He can it in the distance, moving quickly away from
him, covering huge chunks of ground.

 

Ho SCREAMS at it, trying to get its attention. He's just making
sounds, boyond words at this point.

He PIRES the automatic pistol, six, seven, eight shots, in the

the Tripod.

And it stops.
and it turns.

It's about three hundred yards away from Ray now, and this is it,
this is what it's all come down to, one human being against one
Tripod, and of course he doesn't stend a chance in hell.

The Tripod stands there for a moment, evaluating him. The black
arm extends from its side, the heat-ray disc emerges.

writhing torsos.

and an OLDER WOMAN.

RAY
Rachel?! Rachel!

‘There's much SHOUTING back, people are twisting and turning,
trying to get off of each other to little avail, as the basket
bounces and shakes and rattles as the Tripod keeps moving.

Ray doesn't hear Rachel, but through the twisting bunch of
humanity he gate a glimpse of his little girl's face, trapped
beneath two other:

 

  

Ray reaches out a hand for her, sho reaches back, through the
mags of people, but just when they're about to connect —-

 

-- the basket tilts up at a forty-five dagree angle suddenly,
producing a fresh round of SCREAMING fron the trapped humans.

Ray is lying with his head on the lower end of the basket now, and
through his upside-down viewpoint, we see what's happening.

A small round opening, about eighteen inches acrosa, irises open
at what is now the base of the basket. 1 door, exactly,
it's more like a filmy, liquid cloud suepondad ain the ely a

water vacuole. You can aoe through it, but it's definitely done
and impenetrable when it's closed.

 

    

A set of pincers emerges from inside the Tripod‘s head, passing
through the iris.

 

The pincero SNAP hard and grab hold of whatever's closest, and in
this case it's tho ankle of one of the Teenagers, a boy about
seventeen.

He SCREAMS and the pincers retract. ‘The Toonagor 4s pulled hard,
sucked into the head of the Tripod, he's SCREAMING and he's up to
his knees, thon his waist, thon his shoulders, and hands are
reaching for him, trying to grab held of him, ‘but too late and too

He disappears into the head of the Tripod and the iris SLITHERS

Tho basket abruptly levels itself, jarring everyone in it.

He manages to make eye contact with Rachel and sho fights to got

But the Businesswoman can reach her and she manages to wrench her
own hand free, With it, she gets hold of Rachel’s hand and pulls
her around, so that she can get hold of her father's hand.

They grab onto each other.

Ana the basket tilts again. Upright, at a forty-five degree

The oix remaining humans SCREAM, they know what's next.

Ray looks up, sees the iris at the base of the basket start to

Ray squirms himself around wildly, fighting to jockey himself
between Rachel and the opening iris. He violently pushes aside
ether bodies and wrigglas dowa near it, pushing Rachel off to the
side in the proceso. But he's ended up with his fost jammed right
against the iris.

The pincers emerge from inside the Tripod's head.

LOADI

+- another Soldier shoves a shell into the launcher. Ray whirls
and covers Rachel with his body as the shell ERUPTS out of the
tube and SLAMS into the side of the Tripod.

The resulting EXPLOSION is huge, and effective. The Tripod's
hull RIPS apart with a SHRIEK of torn metal. Rose-colored fluid
showers everywhere, the thing belches lifeblood, and the Tripod
pitches forward, first to one knee, and then careening all the
way down, SMASHING into the middle of the street.

Suddenly there's a commotion, and the crowd of people around tha
firat Tripod, the one with the hatchway hanging open, leaps back
ag one, but crowds around it.

 

Ray moves forward. ‘There's movament coming from inside the head
of the crashed Tripod, somathing slithering down that hatchway.

  

It's the forelimb of one of the invaders, moving weakly, near
death, trying to drag the bulky body down into the street.

But it has no strength left, it's covered in sickly white spots
like the red wood. Ray studies it, realising something.

RACHEL
What happened? Did they got sick?

COMTIWUBD: (3) 165
Yes they did.
RACHEL
What from?
RAY

Our germs. Maybe infection. stuff
we're immune to, that our bedies fight
off avery day.

The creeping forelimb stops, doad, still halfway in its ship.

RAY (cont'd)
After everything we fought ‘em with,
they died from tha air we breathe and
the water we drink. All the things we
need to live... that's what killed them.

PEOPLE advance slowly toward the hood of the Tripod, incredulous
and hopeful, and now more humans emerge from their hiding places,
crowding the streets.

OMITTED 166
ExT BOSTON - BROWNSTONE BLOCK DAY 167

A neat row of townhouses in one of the oldest parts of Boston. We
settle on the front door of one particular house, we move in

it, and just as wo reach it, the front door is yanked open
and Mary Ann is standing there, the kids‘ mom, alive and well.
She looks right at us and her face breaks with emotion, her handa
go involuntarily to her mouth, she rushes forward into the street
and finds Ray at the base of the stairs, carrying Rachel the last
few yards to her mother.

deeply satisfied but feeling so keenly the loss of
ut then a pair of scuffed boots appear on tha floor
behind Mary Ann and Rachel and Ray follows them up, disbelieving,
and of course the person standing there behind them is --

 

 

RACHEL
ROBBIE!

It ds Robbie, bruised and battered, but very much alive, standing
there in tho doorway of his mother's house. He runs down the
stairs, kind of falls forward, into the street, into his father's
arms.

‘they bug each other, and Rachel hugs them both. Robbie finally
breaks down, the first time we've seen him crying, and in his
sobs we hear a word we haven't heard him say before:

ROBBIE
wee Dad...

Robbie pulls away from his dad and goes to the doorway, drops to
his knees and holds his little sinter and his mom. Ray watches,
ineredulous, moved to tears, looking at his children.

Mary Ann looks up over the shoulders of Rachel and Robbie. Tears
stream from her eyes, she makes oye contact with Ray and mouths
two words -- “hank you."

‘tm appears in the hallvay behind them, and their grandzother
too, hurrying down the stairs at the sound of the voices.

they all look at Ray, thanking him with their eyes, and beckoning
him inside. He valks up the steps, the door closes on all of
them, and an enormous CLANG --

IT BOSTOR STREBT ‘DAY 168

=- echoes as a BELL poals in the tower of a church steeple. The
heavy iron clapper SWISHES through frame and CLANGS again off the
side of the bell.

The VOICE OVER from the beginning returns as we start to rise up
the steeple of the church at the end of the block, shining gold in
the morning sun.

As wo keep rising higher, it's only tho second big, global view
of things we've seon in the movie -- this tims, the morning sun
burns through the clouds over the skyline of Boston. In the
distance, the forms of Tripods are visible dotting the streeta
everywhere. But none of them are moving. They're crashed, or
heeled over on their sides, stopped in their tracks.

We keep rising up and up, over the neighborhood, and wa see four
or five church steeples in this old part of Boston, all with
their belle TOLLING jubilantly, calling SURVIVORS back into the
streets.

The branches of a troo coms into frame, and as we move in

the branches vo sero in on a leaf, moving closor wo seo it's
covered with drops of water. The VOICE OVER from the beginning
comes

VOICE (0.8.)
From the moment the invaders arrived,
breathed our air, ate and drank, they
were doomed.

VOICE (0.8.} (cont'd)
They were undone, destroyed after all of
humanity's weapons and devices had
failed, by the tiniest creatures that
God, in his wisdom, put upon this earth.

 

We keep soving, toward one drop in particular, and within that
drop we see the wriggling outlines of the tiny micro-organisms
that swarm and multiply within it.

VOICE (0.8.) (CONT’D)
By the toll of a billion deaths, we have
earned our immunity, our right to
survive among this planet's infinite
organisms --

As wo go closer and closer and closer seit, the drop fills the
frame, and wa see the tena of thousands of squirming bacteria
inside that drop of water, and we think about how truly
significant they really aro.

VOICE (0.8.) (CONT’D)

-- and that right is ours against all
challengers. For neither do we live nor
die in vain.

 

FADE OUT.

The Ukraine, a country of some fifty-two
million people, is in almost total

series of freakish lightning storms of
catastrophic proportions which struck
the country at approximately 4 a.m.
local time. The Associated Press is
estimating two hundred dead in the
sweeping blackouts which have paralyzed
the country and cut off nearly all
communication with the outside world.

In the middle of the above report, the Bartender picks up the
remote and switches the TV over to ESPH, wher 38 ANCHOR is
reporting over footage of a BASEBALL FLAYER.

 

   

SPORTS ANCHOR
As usual, George Steinbrenner wasted no
time getting out his checkbook this off-
season, signing free agent right fielder
Marcus Williams to a reported three
year, fifty-eight million doller
contract yesterday in Milwaukee.
Williams, who is thirty-eight, batted
+262 with the Brewers last year,
pounding out 31 home runs and 65 RBIs.
