INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION ~ NEW YORK - DAY

New immigrant families stand in ticket lines next to body-

pierced teens. Dozens of languages fly through the air, none
of them English. This is the crossroads of the world for the
down and out, hard luck and New York on 5 dollars a day crowd.

Witness to it all is a grey~bearded BLACK HOMELESS VETERAN who
sits with his prosthetic leg parked beside him.

VET

Dollar fo' a homeless vet. Help out
a homeless vet.

(as a student with a

duffel bag hurries past)
C'mon, li'l man - I fought the war
with your Daddy. P'nam Pen. Y'all
ain't paid me for this leg yet!

A young, SWEDISH COUPLE with backpacks catch his eye.

VET (CONT'D)

Yo, Swiss Miss - let's see that smile!
How ‘bout you Fritz? I know y'all got
a wallet in that backpack.
Freeloadin’ mother-

(stops midword, as an

Asian family with many

bundles passes by)
Heyyy - Jackie Chan! Shanghai Noon!
I take traveler's checks. Yeah,
arrigato to you, too!

He pauses for a moment, with a curious expression, as someone
else catches his eye ...

A BEAM OF HAZY SUNLIGHT shines down through one of the high
arched windows of the terminal building ...

onto a MAN. Or an apparition.

The VET squints, closely ...

as the FIGURE seems to emerge from the sunlight. Dark,
wraparound SUNGLASSES mark his placid face. He wears corduroy
pants, a faded denim shirt. And though he carries no luggage;
his cheap canvas shoes look like they've got some miles on
them.

We will come to know this "man" as PROT. For now, he just
stands there, taking everything in with the fascination of a
tourist, as the crowd bustles around him.

Suddenly - in front of the rest rooms ~

TWO YOUNG THUGS bump into a middle-aged RUSSIAN WOMAN. One
wrenching her SUITCASE away - the other knocking her down.

CONTINUED
1 CONTINUED:
As she screams for help, they run off -
shoving past PROT and into the crowd. Prot watches them for
a moment ... as if unsure whether to register anger or
caution. Then, he turns to the woman.

She is on the ground, dazed and sobbing, while everyone steps
quickly around her.

Prot approaches her. The vet keeping a careful eye on him.
Prot stops, standing over the woman. She looks up at his dark
glasses, stocky shoulders, fearfully. But as he holds his
hand out, and offers a smile ... her fear is strangely allayed.

PROT
Here, let me help you.

The CRACKLE of WALKIE-TALKIES interrupt, as two TRANSIT COPS
hurry over.

1ST OFFICER
Hold it right there!

VET
Oh, man ~ he ain't done nothin'.

The OFFICERS nevertheless regard Prot with suspicion.

1ST OFFICER
Step away from her.

PROT
This woman is hurt.

2ND OFFICER
Ma'am, what happened?

The woman struggles with limited English.

WOMAN
Eh - take bag ... eh - hit.

2ND OFFICER
Who took your bag and hit you? This
man?

The vet shakes his head at the cops, sorrily.

VET
No, no. Couple a punks. They ran ran
eff. Y'always comin' around too
late - askin' what? Where? How?
This brother just tryin' to help her.

The lst officer speaks into his radio:

and assault victim with facial wound
at West Forty-Second entrance,

(then, to Prot)
Sir, I'd like you to just stand right
there, answer a couple of questions
for me. Standard Procedure.

The 2nd officer carefully handcuffs Prot. Prot gives both
officers a curious smile, as if discerning a foreign custom.

PROT
Of course.

1ST OFFICER
Are you travelling somewhere?

PROT
I've arrived. My travels are over for *
the time being. *

1ST OFFICER
Where's your luggage?

PROT
Luggage? *
iST OFFICER *
Your bags. *
PROT *
I don't require luggage. *

The officer takes a good, hard look at Prot. His sunglasses,
canvas low-tops, general appearance. Outside, an ambulance
pulls up with a whoop. An M.T. enters the Station, starts
tending to the woman.

1ST OFFICER
{pressing Prot}
Do you have a ticket?

(off Prot's look) *

A train ticket. A ticket stub. *
PROT : *

I didn't arrive by train. *

A wry understanding moves across both officers' faces.

1ST OFFICER

West Forty-Two. We have an E.D.P.

2ND OFFICER
(to Pret, politely)
I'm going to ask you to come with us.

PROT
(polite in return)
Certainly.
As Prot is led away, the VET Straps on his leg and gets
himself up. For some strange reason he feels an affinity with
Prot.
A2 EXT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION - DAY A2

As Prot is led outside. His dark glasses take in the noisy
chaos of New York, with amazement.

The VET hobbles out the doors, as PROT is placed in a POLICE
CAR. The lst officer comes back over to the vet.

1ST OFFICER
You see this fella come out of a gate?

DR. MARK POWELL, who has been staring out his window, closes
it, shutting out the noisy world.

ERNIE sits in a comfortable chair. Pale, nervous, he wears
rubber gloves and speaks through a surgical mask.

ERNIE

It's liquid now, so you can't choke on
it. It'll help you Sleep. And you
need to sleep, Ernie. Sleep is good.

Ernie shakes his head vehemently.

ERNIE

Sleep!? You ~ you - you know what
happens when you sleep? You can
swallow your tongue - or - or fall out
of bed, break your neck.

(slumps in the chair, a

hopeless knot of worry)
Or ... or burst a blood vessel in your
head. Never even wake up ...

Powell's BEEPER goes off, much to his relief. He glances at
the clock on the wall, Presses a buzzer by his chair.

ERNIE
Is ... is our time up?

Powell addresses the fear on Ernie's face with a rushed smile.

POWELL
Only for today, Ernie.

He barely waits for the attendant, SIMMS, to come in and
escort Ernie out, before speaking into a hand held RECORDER:

POWELL (CONT'D)
Patient one-five~six, Ernie Coleman.
Suggest slightly increased dosage of
anafronil.

INT. POWELL'S OUTER OFFICE - IN A MINUTE
As Powell gets his jacket from the coat rack.

JOYCE TREXLER sits at her computer. Pictures of her husband,
a policeman, and her grown children grace her desk. As well
as a knit affirmation that reads: "There is a Rest_ of Your

Life." She keeps her eyes on her screen, her voice pleasant:

MRS. TREXLER
Two calls. Your wife, bring home a
bottle of wine. And Doctor
Chakraborty ~ transfer from Bellevue
he wants you to take a look at.

Joyce hands him a file.

POWELL
Great. Who is it this time, Jesus or
Joan of Arc?

Mrs. Trexler just raises an eyebrow to him. After fifteen
years as his secretary, she's used to the sarcasm.

MRS. TREXLER
Doctor Chakraborty didn't say.

INT. MANHATTAN PSYCHIATRIC - MAIN FLOOR

Powell navigates through NURSES, SOCIAL WORKERS, POLICE
transferring homeless psychotics...

Head Nurse BETTY MCALLISTER, an unflappable woman, blocks his
path with a clipboard. Beside her, two ATTENDANTS hold a
disheveled SCREAMING MAN.

MCALLISTER
Can you admit this patient, Doctor
Powell? They found him on the West
Side Highway. Auditioning to be
somebody's hood ornament.

POWELL
Why is he screaming?

MCALLISTER
He thinks if he stops the world will
end.

POWELL
Not before Saturday night. I have
Knicks tickets.

McAllister gives him a wry eye, as he signs the admitting
paper. Just as he's about to escape, she hands him a second
clipboard.

I don't want to boost Mrs. Archer's
Zoloft. I want Mrs. Archer to get out
and get some exercise.

MCALLISTER
With who ~~ her personal trainer?
C'mon, Doc. I'm short-handed here.

Powell looks at the clipboard. Reluctantly writes the
prescription. As yet another clipboard is slipped to him.

MCALLISTER
Ed. Halidol. He bit Navarro's thumb
off, yesterday!
POWELL
I know, Betty. But Haldol's not going

He hands her back her clipboard, leaves her with a wink.

INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS
Powell releases a harried breath against the closed door -

then notices he shares the elevator with an ATTENDANT and a
PATIENT. The patient, SAL, a big, puggish, middle-aged bald
man gives Powell an evil eye.

SAL
You stink!

As the attendant waits with Sal, Powell obliges him with a
brief smile. As he exits, saying:

INT. MANHATTAN PSYCHIATRIC - HALLWAY A6

Powell moves past a ONE-WAY GLASS. Sees Prot in his room for
observaton, apparently looking at himself in the glass.

Something about Prot -- perhaps simply his arresting

appearance ~~ stops Powell. He stops to look at him. It is *
as if Prot is looking directly at him. *

Powell stops a puzzled beat. Prot smiles.

CLOSE ON several X-RAYS and MRI SCANS of a CRANIUM as they're

Physician. Harvard School has not dulled his affable Indian
accent. He turns as Powell enters.

POWELL
Did they change out the one-way glass
in the observation room?

CHAKRABORTY
No. Why?
POWELL
Because there's a guy in there -~ [

could swear he was watching me.
What's wrong with him?

CHAKRABORTY
He arrived at Bellevue a month ago,
suspicion of hallucinogenic
intoxication - but found negative for
substances of any kind. Blood values,
EKG ~ all normal. No sign of
concussion, no brain tumor, no
temporal lobe epilepsy ~ no indication
of organic abnormality whatsoever.
However, after one month, amnesia and
delusion have persisted.

impossible.

Chakraborty looks over his bifocals, at Powell.

CHAKRABORTY
That's why they've sent him to you.

Powell takes in Chakraborty's look for a Moment. Then, with
a frown, looks back down at the FILE.

POWELL
Terrific. No I.D. No Missing Persons
reports matching his description ...
Then, baffled, Powel] lifts up from the file ... a sheet of
notebook paper, handwritten in pencil, of the most astounding
alien-looking HIEROGLYPHICS.

POWELL
What the hell is this?

He had it on him.

Powell can't help let out a wry chuckle.

face.

POWELL (CONT'D)
Come in.

Two attendants, NAVARRO and Simms escort ... PROT ... into the
room. He wears the same denim shirt, corduroy pants and
canvas shoes as we saw him in before.

He smiles, from behind his dark glasses, at Powell.

Navarro, a big, bearish Puerto Rican, reassures Powell with a
nod, anda bandaged thumb's up.

NAVARRO
This one's gentle as a Pussycat, Doc,

Powell, nevertheless, keeps a careful eye on Prot, who remains
standing ... as Navarro and Simms exit, closing the door.

Powell motions to one of two CHAIRS.

POWELL
Won't you have a seat.

PROT .
Have a seat, curious expression.

As they both slowly sit, Powell probes Prot's sunglasses.

I want you to feel comfortable.

Prot reaches for a bowl of FRUIT on the desk beside them.

PROT
Thank you. May I?
Powell considers the request, a little wary.

POWELL
Please.

Prot picks an APPLE, admiring it.
PROT - .
Red Delicious you call this variety.
My favorite.
Powell watches as Prot takes a bite with a rapturous sigh.

I'd like to begin by asking if you

PROT
Capital K- hyphen - capitals P-A-x.
Roughly translated into your Roman

apple)
K-PAX is a planet.

Powell contemplates the conviction with which this was just

said. When

Prot suddenly laughs:

PROT (CONT'D)
Don't worry - I'm not going to leap
out of your chest!

POWELL
Ch, I'm not worried. It's just that
I'm only familiar with nine planets.

PROT

(between bites)
Actually, there are ten, but that
doesn't matter - I'm not from your
solar system. K-PAX is about a
thousand of your light years from
here. Near what you call your
Constellation LYRA.

Quite a ways. I'm curious ... how did
you get to Earth?

PROT
That's somewhat difficult to explain.

POWELL

Prot pauses from eating, trying to think of how to put it.

PROT
It's a matter of harnessing the energy
of light.
(sees Powell is not going
to get it)

I know that sounds - crazy ~- to you.
You beings are eons away from
discovering light travel.

Powell watches ... as Prot raises a hand so that his fingers
touch the hazy SUNLIGHT filtering through the window blinds.

POWELL
You travel at the speed of light?

PROT
Oh, no. We can travel many times that
speed, various multiples of c.
(laughs)
Otherwise, the trip here would have
taken me about a thousand years, now
wouldn't it have?

Powell tries to couch his puzzled amusement with seriousness.

POWELL
What if I were to tell you - that
according to a man who lived on our
planet, named Einstein, nothing can
travel faster than the speed of light.

Prot looks at Powell, with an astute smile.

PROT
I would say you misunderstand
Einstein, Doctor Powell - may I call
you Mark?
(getting chummy)

What your Einstein said, Mark, was
that nothing can accelerate to the
speed of light because its mass would
become infinite. epnstein Said
nothing about entities alread
traveling at the speed Of Tight, or
faster - at tachyon speeds.

Powell stares back at him, at a complete loss.

You can look it up.

POWELL

Thank you, I will.

Prot watches Powel] jot down something with his Montblanc pen.

PROT
I detect a note of skepticism, Doctor
Powell.

POWELL

Not at all. It's just that - you
speak English so well, I'm amazed.

PROT
It's not a very difficult language to
zearn. You should try speaking wxljqz-
pit.

Powell puts his pen down, even more amazed at the guttural
clicks and sounds that just came out of Prot's mouth.

POWELL
i'm a little confused. Maybe you
could explain to me, how it is -asa
visitor from space — you look so much
like me ~ or any other Earth person?

PROT
(patiently)
Why is a soap bubble round?

( flexed. }
perplexedly
Why is a boap bubble round?

PROT
For an educated person, you repeat
things quite a bit, Mark. A soap
bubble is round because that is the
most energy-efficient configuration.
Similarly, on this planet I look like
you ~ on K~PAX, I look like a K-PAXian.

Powell's daughters, NATALIE, 6, and GABBY, 9, sit trancelike
in front of their PlayStation on a giant TV screen.

talking - I said maybe. Maybe some
time in August looked clear.

A dispirited look crosses her pretty eyes ... as he turns back

INT. BATHROOM ~ EVENING 3

Powell turns off the water, sits on the tub's edge, sleeve
wet. Natalie, in the bubble bath, gives him the silent
treatment.

As Powell tries to get her to look at him, he thinks a moment,
laughs to himself, adopting a mock seriousness:

POWELL
Did you know ... that we live ona
Class BA-3 planet?

Natalie finally meets his eyes, with a bewildered kid's brow.

NATALIE
Why are you talking crazy?

INT. WARD 2 - DAY ROOM ~ MORNING 10

CLOSE ON HOWIE, 30 years old, unkempt hair, thick wire-rim
glasses covered with grime. He reads a dog-eared volume of

the Time/Life Nature Library, eyes racing across the pages.

Ernie sits with him at the same table.

About him, in the large DAY ROOM, we see the other charges of
the ward. BESS, a skinny, dread-locked black woman with the
saddest face, sits in front of the TV, watching a
snowboarding segment. Russell is walking around with his
bible. Sal sits alone coloring.

POWELL
(feigning seriousness)
is the pain associated with
intercourse itself, with ejaculation,

PROT
It is associated with the entire
Process. I am aware these activities
result in pleasurable sensations for
you humans. But for us, the effect is
quite the opposite. This applies for
both the males and females of our
species - and incidentally - for most
other beings around the Galaxy.

POWELL
Can you compare the effect to anything
I might be able to understand » like
a toothache, or - ?

PROT

It's more like having your gonads
caught in a vice, except we feel it
all over. To make matters worse, the
sensation is associated with something
like your nausea, accompanied by a
very bad smell. The moment of climax
is like being kicked in the stomach
and falling into a pool of mot shit.

Powell can't believe he's going along with this.

Chakraborty hesitates: .

CHAKRABORTY (CONT'D)
Of course ... Prot's explanation is
that ... due to his planet's peculiar
quality of light caused by its two
suns, K~PAXians are used to light
conditions much like our twilight most
of the time.

POWELL
What the hell are you saying, Chak?
IT didn't think human beings could see

PROT
Let me tell you something, Marko.
Most humans subscribe to the policy of
"an eye for an eye," "a life for a
life." Most of your religions are
famous for this formula, known
throughout the Universe for its
stupidity. Your Christ and your
Buddha had a different vision, but
nobody paid any attention to them, not
even the Christians and Buddhists.
So, no. On K~PAX beings do not kill
other beings, but if they did there'd
be no punishment. Apparantly this is
impossible for Earth beings to
understand, but it's the secret of
life, believe me.

POWELL
No crime, brutality, violence on K-PAX?

EXT. POWELL BACKYARD - CONNECTICUT - MEMORIAL DAY 20
CHICKEN, HOT DOGS AND CORN SIZZLING ON AN OUTDOOR GRILL.

A swing hangs from a giant spruce. Natalie and Gabby are
being chased by their cousin, JOSH, 10, around the big yard.

Powell, lost in thought, watches over the grill. As Rachel
Comes up, snaps her fingers in front of his face, playfully.
Then gives him a kiss.

RACHEL
Where were you just now?

Powell just gives her a frustrating smile, and puts the corn
on a platter, handing it to her.

RACHEL
Kids! Wash up!

Powell knocks back his glass of wine, leaves it by the grill.
And follows her across the yard, with a second Platter heaped
with hot dogs and chicken -

almost tripping over SHASTA, a golden retriever, who is being
chased under the back porch.

POWELL
Josh, don't tease the dog!

He sets the platter down on a PATIO TABLE ~- at which sit his
sister ABBY, late-thirties, and her husband, STEVE, a burly,
bearded fellow.

POWELL (CONT'D)
Here we are.

Napkins are opened, and pungry "Ooohs" evoked. The kids join
them at the table. As they all sit down and start eating,
Abby and Rachel eye each other, before Abby addresses her
rother.

ABBY

Well ... I have a patient who seems to

Uh-oh. Winged monkey at two o'clock.
Prot turns, curiously, as Powell marches up.

POWELL
Excuse us for a moment, Ernie.

Ernie looks from Prot to Powell. Then, fearfully, up at the
sky. He scrambles backwards across the lawn, up the veranda
steps, and into the refuge of the hospital.

While Powell views Prot with an aggravated breath.

FLYNN
Yes, well. Let's start with this idea
of light travel, shall we? What can
you tell us about that?

Nothing.

The scientists give each other dubious glances.

They respond to this with tentative laughter. Steve takes
over, being friendly.

Powell has to smile, a bit sadly, as he regards Prot, seeing
what a farce this is becoming.

When Flynn attempts to be serious again, perusing Prot's
notebook PAGES in front of him.

FLYNN
Prot, you've indicated in your ~
motes ~ that your planet K-PAX orbits
the twin stars Agape and Satori near
the constellation Lyra. Frankly,
we're a bit mystified as to how you
gained knowledge of such a Planetary
system around these stars.

At the planetarium console, Steve presses another button - and
a huge INSERT OF A MAGNIFIED STAR SYSTEM APPEARS projected
against the dome of stars.

FLYNN (CONT'D)

This was taken from the Hubble. We
computer enhanced it, based on Doctor
Patel's readings from telescopes in
Chile and Hawaii. It is the clearest

Prot makes a mark on the lightpad over the projector. He
looks up. It appears as a scribble across the STAR SYSTEM.
He shakes his head, erases it, then starts again, animated,
looking up to the stars with every mark he makes.

The scientists lean back in their chairs with bafflingly
amused expressions.

But as Prot's scribbles take shape up ABOVE THEM ... their
expressions begin to change ...

For there ... projected over the STARS ... emerges a cogent,
detailed DIAGRAM of what looks like a 4-PLANET SOLAR SYSTEM
around the two brightest stars. Complete with a grid of
ANGLES and FORMULAS of relative distances.

Prot looks up, puts down the stylus, satisfied.
Flynn, slowly, takes the pipe out of his mouth.

FLYNN
Steven ... could you input that ...

STEVE
Already on it.

Steve has the Princeton Observatory database on line. As
maltiple STAR CHARTS and theoretical CHARTS appear on his
MONITOR, he hurriedly inputs Prot's information from the DOME.

Powell looks from Prot's diagram to the scientists, confused.

POWELL
What - what's going on?

NAVARRO

Looks like the real thing to me.

Flynn, Patel and Hessler get up from their chairs to crowd

pecking. Finally settling on a branch.

As Powell gazes upon it, in profound astonishment - Villers

the day room doorway. Their eyes lock for a moment.

Prot smiles at him.
And then ... Powell, to his absolute amazement, sees Mrs.

commotion with wide eyes, and the smile of a little girl.
Taking hold of Prot'’s arm ...

A narrow bed and a small metal table are the only fixtures.
Prot sits at the TABLE in front of his grilled WINDOW, his
glasses resting beside him. He looks up ... to a few STARS
twinkling through the grill.

PROT'S POV. The stars visibly move across the cloudy heavens.

Their faraway light fills his face. He closes his eyes,
concentrating ...

and starts drawing DOTS, fast and furious, on the blank SHEET
OF PAPER in front if him.

IN THE HALLWAY - Bess, roaming the halls, stops. In front of

Just fine.

Prot walks on, pointing a finger at Navarro, who points a
finger back at him.

NAVARRO
My man.

A furtive Sal gets his attention, with a "Pssst." Curious,
Prot comes over. Sal glances up and down the hallway to make
sure no one's watching, motions Prot into the ART ROOM.

INT. ART ROOM ~ CONTINUOUS AS4

Patient artwork is all over the walls. Sal draws Prot closer,
keeps his voice low.

SAL

Why have you stayed here so long, Sal,

God! What putrid, disgusting

That's why they put me in here.
Because nobody wants to hear the

He looks right into Prot's dark glasses, with a sense of close
camaraderie.

SAL (CONT'D)
Except for you. That's why I knew ...
you'd be able to help me,

As Sal's lip trembles, Prot's own expression changes, as if
dwelling on Sal's plight. Then, his voice soothing:

You must smell the yort blossoms on my

As Powell approaches, something clearly on his mind. He .

on the stone bench.

POWELL

I had my weekly session with Sal
today. “He says you're taking him to
K-PAX.

In fact, I've heard from most of the
Patients on Ward Two. They all tell
me they're going to K-PAX. TI wonder
if that's a wise thing to be promising
patients in a psychiatric facility.

Prot knits his brow, with a problematic sigh.

PROT
No, no, no. I told them all very
clearly. I would only be able to take
one person with me when I return.

Powell blinks, not sure he's heard correctly.

But to Powell's surprise, Shasta wags her tail, flattening

spoonful . Until there is a heaping mountain of it on his
plate.

mouths to not laugh. Prot glances up, gives them all a smile.

Everyone takes this as a cue to start eating, food is passed
around. Dom, putting ketchup on his burger, pauses self-
consciously a moment, as he watches Prot shovel in fruit salad.

Danny, 180 pounds of varsity wrestler, is flung off. Leaving
Dom, Powell ~ and now Steve ~ straining to hold Prot down.
DOM
God, he's strong as an ox!

POWELL
Betty, quick!

McAllister goes for her purse, uncaps a syringe.
Mrs. Trexler helps Danny up, viewing Prot with a mixture of
fear and pity - as the others try and keep him down.
POWELL
Turn off the goddamn sprinklers!

In the struggle, Prot's GLASSES get knocked off. With a moan,
he buries his face in his hands.

Abby finally gets the sprinklers off. Rachel clutches Natalie.

Fowell, Dom and Steve stand up, slowly, carefully, dripping
wet.

Prot remains on his knees, head to the ground. His shoulders
shaking. Shasta licks him, whimpering.

He gropes on the grass, finding his glasses. Puts them on.
Then lifts his head, a little isoriented. He gets up,

brushes himself off. Bewildered by all the unnerved FACES
staring back at him. Natalie, now afraid, hides behind Rachel.

Prot just smiles, sniffs the air -

PROT
is that apple pie I smell?

He walks, unsteadily, towards the picnic table. He sits,
serves himself a slice of APPLE PIE. Starts devouring it.

Rachel comes up to Powell, angrily.
RACHEL
Happy? I think you got through to
him, don't you? I think you made your
dent!

She throws the towel at him she has just dried Natalie off
with, and walks away.

INT. VILLERS' OFFICE - DAY
Powell paces in front of Villers, at her desk.

POWELL
-.-He was pushing my daughter on a
swing like he'd done it a hundred
times before. Not like some alien from
K~-PAX. I saw him. He was connecting
with something. Some kind of normal
ife...

VILLERS
That's not enough.

POWELL
You can't transfer him to the fourth
floor. (It'll kill him. Not now --
when I'm actually making some progress
with him.

VILLERS
This is a violent patient.

POWELL
He's not violent. I think something
violent happened to him. Prot wasn't
going after Natalie to harm her. He
was trying to protect her.

VILLERS
From the sprinklers?

POWELL
I don't know from what.

VILLERS
I need more to go on than a hunch.
Otherwise-—

POWELL
We need to regress him. Take him back
into the past. Find out what happened
and force him to confront it.

VILLERS
Hypnotize him? When did you last
conduct a hypnosis session? Med
school? Do you have any idea how
risky it is to regress a patient like
this one?

POWELL
He has to be pushed. There's no
time. He says he's going back to
K-PAX on July 27th. That's three
weeks away. I think he could become
violent on that day -~ hurt himself or
someone else -— ‘

VILLERS
You know what the problem is, Mark?
You're too close to this patient.
Everyone can see it but you.

I'm transferring him to the fourth
floor. That's final.

Powell thinks a beat.

POWELL

Then you help me do it.

POWELL

You were right. What do I know
about hypnosis? A six-hour course
when I was a resident. You can do
this. You're the expert. There's
nobody better.

VILLERS
That's exactly why I won't do it.
I've seen what can happen.

POWELL

how crazy or screwed up your world is,

INT. WARD 2 —- MORNING

Powell stands in the doorway of PROT'S EMPTY ROOM. Navarro
and Simms stand there with him.

POWELL
What do you mean - he's gone!?

Navarro and Simms eye each other, extremely embarrassed, but
extremely stumped.

NAVARRO
He's just ... gone.

Powell shakes his head, unwilling to hear this. He marches
over to a SECURITY MONITOR by the nurse's station, Navarro and
Simms following on his heels.

A SECURITY GUARD is already rewinding the night's surveillance
video for them. They all watch the MONITOR ... on it, Prot
appears walking down the hallway, and into his room.

NAVARRO
That's around six-thirty, after
dinner. He goes in...

Powell keeps his eyes glued to Prot's door in the time-stamped
video, as it is fast-forwarded. We SEE what Navarro relays:

NAVARRO

Howie lifts his head, casually, from a book.

a few more countries left to visit,
before he could finish his report.

ERNIE
Don't ~ don't worry, Doctor Powell.
He'll be back.

POWELL

INT. A STORAGE TUNNEL - LATE AFTERNOON 67

We're in the bowels of the hospital. It's pitch dark, save
for the beams of several flashlights.

Powell, wearing an obsessed expression, plays his beam over
broken Xerox machines and corroding file cabinets. A young
SECURITY GUARD gives him a weary look.

SECURITY GUARD
We've checked every inch of this
hospital, Doctor Powell. Nobody ever
comes down here.

A 2ND BEEFIER SECURITY GUARD, down on his belly, flashes his
beam into the last corner of the tunnel - illuminating a brick
wall. He looks back at Powell, shaking his head.

Powell looks at them both, wipes a cobweb from his face.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM, EMERGENCY STAFF MEETING ~ LATE DAY 68

McAllister, Chakraborty, Fleen, the rest of the gang, seated.
As Villers stares - incredulous ~ at Powell, who stands.

VILLERS
Patients don't just escape from this
institution. They don't just escape!

POWELL

(knowing how bad it

sounds)
There's no evidence of escape ... but,
obviously, I've notified the police,
social services. They're taking it as
a low priority since he has no clear
record of being a public threat ...

VILLERS

(having heard enough)
I'm going to have a great time
explaining this to the state board.
We have psychotics up on Ward Four
packing their sneakers because they

He hangs up, looks through the doorway to his outer office -
where Mrs. Trexler still sits.

Curiously, he gets up, shirt rumpled, tie loose. He walks
over, observing her diligent face - as she scrolls through
windows of lists and information on her COMPUTER.

MRS. TREXLER

Phil's old partner down at the 4th
Precinct - who's now a detective -—
gave me a password to search their

(shaking her head)
No police reports of anybody fitting
Prot's description being picked up.

POWELL
Joyce, it's eleven o'clock at night
and you're still here. I know why I'm
still here - but why are you still
here?

She laughs, as if this were a silly question, eyeing her DAY
CALENDAR ... which already says JULY 17.

MRS. TREXLER
Doctor Powell, do you know how long it
takes to search a database like this?

POWELL
That doesn't answer my question.

She turns from his pointed gaze, back to her computer. Then,
Pauses, to regard the PHOTO of her HUSBAND on her desk, fondly.

MRS. TREXLER
The other day ... when Prot came in,
he asked me about Phil.
(beat, still hard for her)
I said ... my husband was killed in
the line of duty ten years ago. Prot
looked at me with that, you know,
alien, curious look. And asked me ...
why I still keep a picture of him.

I told him ... because it reminds me
of all the happiness we had together.

Powell looks at her, not even knowing how to respond.

INT. POWELL'S OFFICE - EARLY MORNING 70
Powell, asleep, his head on his desk. A finger of SUNLIGHT
streams in across the desk ... kisses his face. He squints,
stirring, wakes up. Realizes he’s been there all night.

He sits there a moment. Then, puts his hand into the beam of
sunlight ... a funny sensation coming over him.

He gets up, quickly, follows the BEAM ~ out his office - into
the HALLWAY. To a window. He peers out -

te the hospital grounds, below. Birds chirp in the early
morning sun, dew is still on the grass. And on the bench by
the fountain ... sits a solitary FIGURE.

Powell can tell from the back - that it is Prot.

EXT. HOSPITAL GROUNDS - IN A QUICK MINUTE 71

As Powell, tie loose, suit wrinkled, hair disheveled, races
across the grounds to Prot, who hears him coming up, behind.

PROT

POWELL

laugh, then back to Prot)
You're a patient here! You don't get
out of here without a discharge.
Nobody does! Nobody has, nobody ever
will! And don't, don't give me that
beam of light shit. Because I don't
buy it!

Prot shifts his glasses away, somewhat confused and disturbed.
As Powell sits down next to him. Powell's eyes remain,
intently, on him.

POWELL
What would you say - if I were to tell
you that I don't believe you took any
trip to Iceland, Greenland, or any
Place? That I don't believe you're
from K-PAX. That I believe you are as
human as I am.

PROT
I would say you were in need of a
thorazine drip, Doctor.

Powell walked right into that one.

POWELL
Then, I appeal to your intelligence.
Can't you at least admit the
possibility that I MIgGHt be right?

PROT
I will admit the possibility. If you
will admit the possibility that I am
from K-PAX.

Powell realizes, at this moment, just how much this "being"
has gotten under his skin. It is also, at this moment, he
senses his opportunity:

at the birds and the trees and the high brick wall.

Powell's voice becomes gentle, earnest.

Long gone are the Wall Street commuters. In fact, the only
two souls on the deserted train car are Powell and a HOMELESS
MAN

Powell, wrung out, rides with an aimless look.

The HOMELESS MAN jabbers to himself, in a plastic Star Wars
helmet and pink tights. Under a soiled trenchcoat, a faded
Sweatshirt reads: "Beam Me Up" ...

As Powell stares at him ... caught in the crazy loneliness of
the man's babble ... his own full sense of failure hits him.
Seized by the desire to do something, he fishes out his wallet
to gives the fellow a dollar. But as he does -

PROT'S PENCIL falls out of his pocket - onto the train floor.

Powell looks down at it, surprised. A beat. His eyes
narrowing ...

The pencil is blue ... whittled down almost to nothing from
use.
Powell reaches down, picks it up. Curious ... then ... with

an inconceivable look ...

On the side of the pencil, almost worn out, is a word and a
half "The Salva..." And underneath it, what looks like an

A wild SHOUT escapes Powell. He hangs up. Thrusts more coins

INT. POWELL'S OFFICE - LATE NIGHT 117

Mrs. Trexler, hastily put together, sits at her computer.

MRS. TREXLER
There are a dozen Salvation Army

Las Cruces, Roswell -- wait a minute.
There's one in Santa Rosa.

She looks up to her wall, at the MAP of slaughterhouses.
Powell is right with her. As she moves her finger - to one of
three RED PINS in New Mexico. The one stuck in a small town
named Guelph.

POWELL
(squinting at the map)
Guelph, New Mexico. Looks pretty damn
close to Santa Rosa. *

Trexler gets out of one web site - onto another, exploring.

INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE - GUELPH, NEW MEXICO - DAY 120

The SHERIFF, who walks with the gut and gait of a man used to
his small town badge, flips through an old squeaky file
cabinet.

While Powell sits against the edge of a desk, briefcase and
coat in hand, waiting. The slow pace here is maddening. He
can't help glance at the Cattleman's Bank DAY CALENDAR on the
wall ... July 26th.

SHERIFF
I remember the case, all right. Just
about the biggest thing ever happened
in these parts.
(eyes Powell, wryly)
We're not from New York City, you know.

He finds the file.

SHERIFF
Porter. Robert Porter. Here it is.

He looks through it, remembering, with a regrettable shake of
his head. Walks over to let Powell take a look,

SHERIFF

As Powell stares up at the tall wooden STRUCTURE. It Stands
like a hellish, grinding furnace against the stark blue sky.

But to Powell, it is an affirmation of the truth. And as he
dets out a silent laugh of awe, we WIDEN -

te take in the expanse of mooing ANGUS STEERS. Literally
acres of them. The smell practically in our nostrils.

The Sheriff comes up, stands beside him.

_. SHERIFF
Yes, sir ... the old butchery.

Powell turns to him, astounded, at hearing that phrase.
SHERIFF
C'mon. I'll take you by the house.
EXT. PORTER HOUSE - DAY 122
As the Sheriff's CAR comes up a dirt road, to stop ...
at the RUINS of what was once an idyllic small farm. Powell
climbs out of the car, slowly. Lets the place seep into his
senses.
The Sheriff comes around the car, viewing the ruins, solemnly.
SHERIFF
Been empty. Nobody comes anywhere
near here since ... all that happened.
No living next of kin for the place to
go to, anyway.

He takes his hat off, almost respectfully, and walks up the
overgrown path. Powell following him ~

up stone steps ~ into a HOUSE that is little more than pillars
in the open air.

122 CONTINUED: 122

A loveseat taken over by weeds, shards of dishes, a mirror,
clumps of what were once books, toys ... is all that is left
to testify that a family once lived here.

Powell's eyes fall, a moment, on the broken hammers of what
Was once a piano sound board ... as the Sheriff begins,
grimly, quietly:

SHERIFF
Had detectives come from Albuquerque
try an’ piece this one together.
Accordin' to the official Story ...
Porter was at work s+. when this
drifter, a Daryl Walker, came by the
house, Two-time parolee, lookin' for
trouble. Know what I'm sayin'?
Started out as a robbery. “Wife and
daughter were out back 1...

CLOSER ON POWELL .., he gazes out Past the hinges of what once
s35.2 back door. He hears Prot’s VOICE Calling ... "Becky?
Sarah?

AND HE FLASHES oN:

PROT'S FACE, But it is now ROBERT PORTER'S FACE. A happy,
tired humanity on it as he gets out of his truck, overalis
stained after a hard day's work. He waits for his daughter to
Tun out of the house and into his arms. Waits ...

But he is met with an eerie silence, Perplexed, he heads up
the stone path - and into the HOUSE.

SHERIFF (V.0.)
What we gather ... from forensics and
all, was that - this Walker - brought
both women back in the house at
gunpoint,

FOLLOWING PORTER ~ his boots trudge up the stairs, face
growing worried at the Silence.

PORTER
Becca ... Saree?
His breathing becomes quicker, Panicked, as he moves down the
narrow hallway ... sees a doll on the floor ++. @n overturned
watering can ... he comes to the bedroom ...

AS WE COME BACK TO:

POWELL FLASHES ON:

THE BEDROOM ... blood everywhere ... hands tied to bedposts
5 naked legs splayed ...” bare feet dangling over the sides
of a bed.

ON PORTER ... witnessing this, eyes frozen. He wears the look
of a man whose universe has, in one instant, shattered. And
left him in the airless blackness of Space. From deep within
him comes a Choking sound ..,

SHERIFF (V.0.)
Porter must've come home, found Walker
still here ..,

Porter staggers back inte the hallway ~ to see WALKER. who,
scared, takes out a gun. Dazed, but with an animal~like
reflex, Porter knocks it out of his hand. They struggle for
the gun, like two grunting beasts until Porter ... with an
inhuman strength, grabs Walker's wrists, and pins him to the
wall. Then raises his ether fist ... a Savage look coming
into his eyes. A look built up over a iifetime of meekness.

AND WE STAY ON PORTER'S FACE - as, With a final Savagery - he
sends the side of his fist into Walker's neck see

SHERIFF (V.0.)
And then knocked the son'n'bitch like
an Angus steer ...

BACK TO
POWELL ~ as he closes his eyes.
POWELL
God all mighty ...
SHERIFF
Snapped a grown man's neck like it was

a twig.

Can't say I wouldn't've done the same.

The Sheriff puts his hat on, walks out, down the rubble of

back steps, Powell follows him -

EXT. PORTER HOUSE ~ ouT BACK - DAY 123
As the Sheriff continues on, toward the trees, Powell lingers

a moment. To view a withered vegetable garden. He approaches

it, astonished ... to see...

the remains of a LAWN SPRINKLER somehow saved from fire. it
sits there in the grip of weeds, attached to a blackened hose.

Along with the scorched handles of what's left of a child's
jump rope. And as Powell stares at it...

AN IMAGE FLASHES ACROSS HIS EYES:

A beautiful young woman, jong black hair shining in the sun
+++ and a little girl, much like Natalie. They jump rope
barefoot, innocently, happily, in the spray of water.

THEN ANOTHER IMAGE:

Dusk. Robert Porter, staggering out of the house. He kneels
down, trying to wash the blood off his hands in the sprinkler,
sees the jumprope ...

As Powell blinks the images from his mind ...
A FINAL ONE COMES To HIM:

NIGHT ... Porter stands on the bank of a rushing RIVER. He
Stares, as if into nothing. Overalls spattered with the dried
blood of both man and Slaughtered cows. With One hand ... he
rips off the straps, lets the overalis fall off him. With the
other hand, he tears the Shirt off his chest. Naked now ...
devoid of any human expression ... he Grops into the water ...
letting it carry him away ...

SHERIFF (V.0.)
We found his clothes here. Probably
where he jumped in ...

EXT. RIVER - DAY 124

Powell stares into the Tushing white water. He and the
Sheriff Standing, carefully, on the bank. As the Sheriff
continues, loudly, above the sound of rapids:

SHERIFF
This river's pretty treacherous, even
in duly. Got’a hell of a current.

He looks downstream, thoughtfully, for a couple moments.

SHERIFF
Still ... 2 s'pose it might've been a
mistake, officially, to list it as a
drowning. Since the body was never
found.

The last glow of the western sun shines through a plane window

He sits there, looking through a copy of the Sheriff's FILE
bearing the label: "Porter"...

There are grizzly photos of the crime scene ... driver's
license photo of Robert Porter ... mug shots of Walker.
Glimpses of words from the report: "Forced entry ... 25 cm
gash ... thorax to abdomen ... blood ...semen ... the

Beside Powell, resting on his briefcase, is also an old high

Powell closes the file, with sober reflection, and looks out

sky-

but his briefcase. The clothes on his back stick to him. He
is bone-weary. But the sight of his home fills him with
emotion.

INT. POWELL'S OFFICE - EVENING 126
Powell looks down at the dog-eared cover of an old Guadalupe

HIGH SCHOOL YEARBOOK, 1985. From Guadalupe County, New

Mexico. It sits on his desk. He looks at it, thinking hard.

Then takes out a bottle of SCOTCH and two tumblers. Places
them beside the yearbook. He pours himself a tumbler. Downs
it. And just stands there, preparing himself, waiting ...

In a couple moments, his door opens. And Prot enters. Powell

Powell stands at the WINDOW, watching the festivities.
As Villers comes up, briefcase in hand, joins him there.

VILLERS
I'm transferring him to Stonybrook
tomorrow. I'm sorry, Mark. There's
just no way I could explain this to
the state board review. The only
reason I didn't do it sooner is -
well, look -

She shakes her head at the spectacle.

too much ...
And with that, she just walks away, to the elevator, gets on.

Don't worry - he's not going anywhere.
Now, get some rest.

Powell regards the clock on the wall: 10:56 P.M. He draws a
reluctant breath.

POWELL
We've got seven hours, Betty. I'll be
up in four.

He turns, tired, to the elevator.

129 INT. DAY ROOM — SAME 129

As the SONG finishes with a loud cheer, Howie comes'up, and
with an air of formality, presents Prot with the ESSAYS. As
everyone remains clapping - Sal suddenly rips off his party
hat. His face angry, desperate. He shouts:

SAL
i can't stand this!

The room turns instantly quiet. Ernie, Maria, Howie, the
others - all put their party whistles down, to look at him.

SAL (CONT'D)
(addressing Prot)
I demand to know. Which one of us is
going with you,

Prot looks around. Seeing that Sal speaks for all. He
smiles, as if he will miss every one of them.

PROT
I will tell you this.
(holding up the essays)
There's extra points for the one who
goes to sleep first.

There is a mad scramble, as everyone dashes for their rooms.
Maria leaves Prot with a tearful embrace.

in a few moments, Howie is the only one left. He walks over,
eyeing Prot through his wire-rims. He clears his throat.

HOWIE
You never gave me my last task.
What's my Last task?
Prot tucks the essays away, whispers to Howie, significantly.

PROT
Stay here...,and be prepared for anything

with a nod of implicit trust...something, slowly, comes into

INT. POWELL'S OFFICE - NIGHT

121.

Powell enters. Emotionally and physically exhausted. It is

then, he notices -

Rachel, sitting there on his couch. A couple of TAKE-OUT
CARTONS in front of her. His surprise is so complete, he

doesn't know what to say.

RACHEL
Chow fun.

At this moment, she is the most beautiful sight he
seen.

POWELL
(realizing)
From the place on Broadway -- with the
ugly lanterns in the window.

She pats the seat next to her. He doesn't resist.
feeds him a bite, and another.

RACHEL
The waiter always shouted at us.

POWELL
The fortune cookies never had any
fortunes in then.

They share a laugh. Then, Rachel gives him a deep
holding up another bite.

RACHEL
We didn't need any. I knew my fortune
that night. He was sitting right
across from me.

Their eyes remain on each other. And Powell realizes how much

this woman means to him.

POWELL
I hope he still is.

Rachel puts down the food. Leans forward. Kisses

him.

As Powell's eyelids start to close, she gently lies him down,

puts a couch pillow under his head ...

INT. WARD 2 ~ PROT'S ROOM - MUCH LATER 131*

Prot sits straight and quiet, arms folded in his lap, holding
his red notebook. His bed is neatly made, the room tidy. He
just sits there as if waiting for a plane.

INT. POWELL'S OFFICE - SAME TIME 132

Powell, asleep, Rachel snuggled up to him. His wristwatch
BEEPS.

He wakes up with a start. Waking her up. He tries to squint
at his watch. Can't see it. Turns to his desk clock: 5:47
A.M.

POWELL

INT. WARD 2 - SAME 133

Navarro sits in the hallway, posted outside Prot's door. An
oxygen tank and respiration equipment stand with hin.

He turns to Simms, posted at the fire escape door, and holds
up a twenty dollar bill.

NAVARRO
Twenty says he goes.

At the SECURITY STATION - the guard checks his three MONITORS:
Prot, sitting in his room. Hallway, Navarro stationed.
Stairwell, empty. He glances up at the CLOCK. As it turns to
5:49 A.M. Then looks over to the nurses station.

SECURITY GUARD
Two minutes. Wonder where Doctor
Powell is?

McAllister closes the book she's been reading, getting a
little fidgety now. She picks up the phone.

MCALLISTER
I'll buzz him.

INT. HOSPITAL - EMPTY HALLWAY - SAME 134

Powell comes skidding around a corner, running as he puts his
jacket on. He hits the elevator button.

As he waits, he is drawn to a window. He looks out, up ~ at

the SKY. There is an electricness about it. A lone star

twinkles in the dark purple pre-light of dawn.

Powell punches the button again, frantically. Then, just

takes the STAIRS.

INT. WARD - SAME 135
The security guard eyes the clock: 5:50 A.M.

SECURITY GUARD
One minute.

On one of his MONITORS, Powell appears dashing down the
stairwell.

SECURITY GUARD
Here comes Doctor Powell.

PROT, IN HIS ROOM - stands up. Takes his dark glasses off.
NAVARRO, IN THE HALLWAY - looks through Prot's door.

NAVARRO
He's movin"!

MCALLISTER comes out from behind the nurses station, alert.

PROT folds his glasses, sets them on his table. He faces his
window ... as the first light of dawn comes through it.

Just as - POWELL bursts onto the WARD, from the stairwell
door. He runs, whispering under his breath —

Prot! POWELL
roti

PROT'S ROOM - the rising SUN sends its first sharp RAY through
Prot's window ~ and into Prot's EYES.

SECURITY STATION ~ the security guard glances at the clock, as
the numbers turn to ... 5:51 ALM.

AND NOW, EVERYTHING HAPPENS AT ONCE
Mrs. Archer runs out of her room -

MRS. ARCHER
Wait for me, you fucker!

She collides with Powell, knocking them both down.

Navarro turns away from Prot's door, to the commotion.

As Powell lifts Mrs. Archer back up, he looks past her - to

see a blinding orange BEAM OF SUNLIGHT shining through the

window of Prot's door.

The security guard looks to the MONITOR of Prot's room. Which
has now gone to static ...

SECURITY GUARD
What the hell?

POWELL grabs Navarro's KEY RING. Runs for Prot's DOOR.

Blinded by the sunbeam coming through its window, he fumbles
for the right key - gets it in the lock — opens the door -

STAY ON POWELL'S FACE - as his eyes search the room ~ the
window ~ the table ~ walls ~ every corner. No trace of Prot.

POWELL
Son of a -

For an instant, a smile of disbelief flashes across Powell's
features. Then his eyes lower ...

POWELL
Oh, God.

He kneels down ... to the BODY crumpled underneath the bed in
a fetal position. Barely conscious, eyes half open with a
dead, vacant look.

POWELL
Oh, God ...
Navarro and McAllister hurry into the room.
NAVARRO
Oh, man ...
INT, HALLWAY ~ IN A FEW MINUTES 136

THE PATIENTS, who have now woken up, gather in the hallway,
murmuring curiously - as Prot is carried out of his room, past
them, on a gurney. His eyes remain vacant, body rigid.
ERNIE
Who's that?
SAL
Beat’s me. How'd he get in here?

Certainly not. Prot's gone.

Maria looks around, as if sensing someone else is missing.

MARIA
Where's Bess?

The patients look at each other, then all around.
ERNIE
Where - where is Bess?
INT. BESS'S ROOM - IN A MOMENT R137
As the patients all converge in her open doorway, staring ...
A pair of hospital slippers sit neatly by Bess's bed. And her
HOSPITAL BRACELET, left neatly on her pillow.
SAL
(devastated)
He chose Bess.
Mrs. Archer's face trembles with envy.

MRS. ARCHER
Bitch.

An ebullient smile spreads across Ernie's face.

ERNIE
He took Bess...

Howie nods. It's true.

HOWIE
He took Bess.

MARIA
Good fo' you, homegirl!

Howie makes his way over to the bed. Picks up ... a piece of *
paper from Bess's pillow. On it ... is a crude, simple *
drawing of flames shooting out of a house. And a bluebird, *
flying away from the fire. And the WORDS: "I Have No Home". *
HOWIE

Bess went to K-PAX. *

How I wish I could say that Robert sat
up one fine day and said "I'm
hungry - got any fruit?"

He looks down at Prot's RED NOTEBOOK, opens it to a title
page, which reads, in pencil: "Preliminary Observations on
B~TIK (Farth)."

Then, his eyes take him out his study window ~- where Rachel,
Gabby and Natalie are planting a rose bush in the garden.

POWELL (V.0.)
Like most catatonics ... he probably
hears every word we say, but refuses,
or is unable to respond. Perhaps with
patience on our part he will recover,
in time.

EXT. CENTRAL PARK ~ CACTUS GARDEN - DAY R14
WIDE SHOT, MOVING IN SLOWLY ...

on ROBERT PORTER, who sits in a WHEELCHAIR, blanket wrapped
around him, hair rustling in a breeze. Powell, seated on a
bench, reads a LETTER, aloud, to him...

POWELL
(having trouble reading
Howie's handwriting)
I like my new job at the library very
much ... I like helping peopie find
things ... except when they get
impatient with me.

AS WE COME IN CLOSE NOW ...

Powell looks at Porter, whose gaze remains vacant. He
continues reading the letter, anyway --

POWELL (CONT'D)

I went and visited Ernie yesterday at
his Mom's house. Did you know, Doctor
Powell, that Ernie's taking a test to
be a crisis counselor?

(laughs at the thought of

this)
Imagine that.

Porter remains mute.

But he registers no reaction.

Powell takes it back, tries to keep a smile. He goes back to
reading the letter --

POWELL
Say hello to all my friends ... I miss
them. And please let me know when
Bess comes back because I want to know

He stops himself. Reflective a moment. Glances at Porter,
troubling. Then, just folds up the letter, puts it in his

z Really worried about Bess.
We've checked shelters, halfway homes,
the police have come up empty ... it's
as if she ... just disappeared.

(looks cannily at Robert)
July twenty-seventh. You wouldn't
happen to want to tell me anything
about that, would you, Robert?

 

He's searching Porter's expressionless EYES.

POWELL
No?

(with an earnest smile)
Well, maybe it'll come to you.
Whenever you're ready. I'll be
waiting.

He gets up, gives Porter a pat on the shoulders. And takes
the handles of the wheelchair. Pushing Porter on, along the
path, through the park.

POWELL
Doctor, patient. Curious human
distinction ...

WE TAKE IN THE DAY ROOM. As Maria gazes out a window. And
Russell mumbles to himself, Bible in hand. And Sal and
Mrs. Archer play a contentious game of fish.

POWELL (V.0O.)
By his own calculations, he is due
again soon.

WE MOVE ON ... into the ART ROOM. Where Navarro, setting a
new patient down at some watercolors, pauses, respectfully ~
to look at PROT'S GLASSES, which rest on a pedestal, like a
shrine, facing the window.

POWELL (CONT'D; V.0.)
The patients in Ward Two have no
