I_THINK WE'RE ALONE NOW

SECOND DRAFT
2/11/16
EXT. TOWN - DAY

The perfect portrait of New England in springtime bloom,
awash in a soft mid-morning light.

All is deathly quiet.

EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY
Every streetlight extinguished.
Not a car on the road. Not a soul to be seen.

Rows of shops closed for business. Their storefront windows
eerily pristine, adorned with classic Americana kitsch.

Two empty rocking chairs tremble in the breeze.

A flock of sparrows coasts overhead, beyond the web of
tangled branches. A v-formation of little black and brown
specks soaring the skies, returning home for the season.

PRE-LAP: Tick. Tick. Tick.

INT. FOYER - FIRST HOUSEHOLD - DAY
A wall clock, keeping time.

It’s cozy in here, but not warm. A palpable chill hangs over
the lived-in parlor. Nobody’s been by in some time.

Four beaming, airbrushed faces in a framed photograph on the
mantelpiece. Father, mother, two-point-five kids.

The glass on the frame is just barely frosted over.
ANGLE on the FRONT DOOR.
From outside: A pair of muted FOOTSTEPS.

The adjacent window QUIVERS as a small SCREWDRIVER slides in
underneath the sill.

It’s a tight fit. The screwdriver’s shaft SCISSORS back and
forth, slowly forcing its way through. GRINDING the sill’s
hardwood base into FLAKES, misting through the air like snow.

A GLOVED HAND reaches into the newly formed crevice, angling
its way toward the front door. TWISTING the LOCK...
The door swings open, revealing a MAN, early 30s, on the
porch. He wears a fleece jacket, baggy workman jeans and
hiking boots. Thick-framed glasses. Average build.

This is DEL.

He scuffs his boots on the floor mat. Surveys the room.

His eyes land on the ticking wall clock. He plucks the clock
from its moorings. Removes the batteries.

The ticking sound abruptly dies.

He re-hangs the clock. Straightens it.

He deposits the batteries in a zip-lock bag. Folds the bag
into the front pocket of a worn Kipling backpack. Swings the
backpack over his shoulder.

The ape keychain dangles at Del’s side, open-mouthed in a
state of perpetual awe.

INT. VARIOUS - FIRST HOUSEHOLD - DAY

Del rummages clinically through the empty home.

He strips the batteries from the smoke alarm. From Daddy's
electric toothbrush. From the kids’ toy RCs and night lights

and mobile gaming consoles. From Mommy’s vibrator.

He neglects the wad of cash on the dresser. The jewelry. The
flat-screen television.

He scans the bookshelf, index finger outstretched. Plucks out
the more obscure titles.

He removes the family portrait from its frame. Sets the frame
upright just where he found it.
EXT. FIRST HOUSEHOLD - DAY

Del kneels in the grass, a surgical mask over his nose and
mouth. He’s spray-painting a large white X across the lawn.

He gets to his feet. Brushes the dirt from his knees. Strips
off his gloves, revealing two pale, bony hands.

We pull back to see every single house on the block, all the
way to the end of the street, marked with the exact same X.
EXT. LAKE - DAY

Del stands at the edge of the water, stark naked, hosing
himself down with a portable camping shower.

EXT. DEL’S TRUCK - DAY

Six buckets of fresh lake water rattle in the rear enclosure
of Del’s pick-up truck.

Del brakes at an intersection. Looks both ways. Continues on.

INT. GROCERY STORE - DAY
Del coasts the aisles with a shopping cart.

Most of the grocery’s stock is still in place, though the
fluorescent lights, fridges and freezers are down.

He checks expiration dates. Takes only what he needs.

EXT. LIBRARY - DAY

Del’s truck pulls to a stop outside the town library.

INT. LIBRARY - DAY

Del replenishes the AAA batteries in his Brother P-Touch®
Label Maker.

He traverses the stacks, adding the books from his haul to
the library’s inventory. Labeling them with their proper
Dewey Decimal codes.

INT. GREENHOUSE - DAY

A wide assortment of plants, shrubs and vegetation. Del
circulates, spritzing each of them with water.

He listens closely. The roots purr and gurgle under their
soil, lapping up the new liquid.

He savors the sound.

EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY

Del pilots a heavy-duty street sweeper up and down the road,
its twin brushes WHIRRING and GRINDING.
INT. READING ROOM - LIBRARY - DAY

Del sits on the floor, piecing together a complicated jigsaw
puzzle of a nautical tableau.

We pull back to discover the room is carpeted with a
seemingly endless collection of puzzles, all completed.
EXT. SOUND - DAY

The sun’s last light casts intense and powerful streaks
across the sky. A lone sailboat bobs on the ocean’s surface.

Del’s bare feet hang from the boat’s edge as he reads one of
his books. His nose swathed in layers of sunblock.

His fishing rod STIRS. Del JUMPS.

He abandons his book, grabbing hold of the rod and reeling in
his line, mad with excitement.

INT. BACK ROOM - LIBRARY - NIGHT

A toy aquarium, battery-operated, filled with plastic
clownfish and glowing neon blue water.

Del’s curled up on a hammock in the darkness, munching on a
well-balanced meal of cooked fish, brown rice and veggies.

He watches an old screwball comedy on a laptop. Chuckles
through mouthfuls of food.

He keeps an eye on the laptop’s battery power. It’s dwindling
at nineteen percent.

A mammoth pile of unused laptops and portable DVD players
rests beside his hammock, stacked like pancakes.

EXT. ROOFTOP - LIBRARY - NIGHT

Del spreads out on a blanket, gazing up at the nighttime sky.

Every single star is visible, every constellation defined, an
awesome natural panorama that belongs to Del and Del alone.

He falls asleep smiling.
INT. BATHROOM - LIBRARY - DAY

Del shaves in the mirror. Clips his fingernails. Tweezes his
eyebrows. Swabs the wax from his ears.

He pops two gummy vitamins.

EXT. STREET - DAY

Del jogs past rows and rows of suburban houses marked with
his white xX.

He crosses into a new part of town, where the front lawns are
still bare. Unexplored territory.

Del stops to catch his breath. He scans the area. Listens.
Hears movement.
He turns, alarmed.

It’s the window blinds from a nearby house. They’re rustling,
scratching softly against the glass...

Somebody’s inside.
Del approaches the porch, moving furtively.
He presses his ear to the door.

From the other side -- something’s CLAWING against the door’s
paneling. Something low to the ground.

Del thinks.
He turns the knob. The door’s unlocked. He pushes it open...

A small DOG bursts forth, wild with newfound freedom. Pawing
frantically at Del’s leg. Eyes wide and watery.

It’s a pug, and a fat one at that. Filthy. Rabid with energy.
And its sharp talons, long ungroomed and ill-maintained, CUT
DEEP into Del’s SKIN...

Del shakes the thing off his leg. Nudges it outside with his
leg. Shuts the door behind him.

INT. SECOND HOUSEHOLD - CONTINUOUS

Del instantly GAGS.

This place REEKS. It’s PUTRID.
Flies circling in droves. Dog shit everywhere.

Del whips the surgical mask over his nose and mouth. He
breathes heavily, his eyes pooling from the stench.

He makes his way through the house. Steps over a big, bulging
bag of DOG KIBBLE -- year’s supply -- it’s been CLAWED INTO.

He proceeds cautiously into the kitchen. The flies’ buzzing
amplifies, grows DEAFENING...

There it is. Slumped across the tiled floor, contorted in an
awkward, awful position... a BODY.

A woman. Very old. Very dead.
Del processes the gruesome scene.
He continues into the living room.

There’s a second body, slouched over in a leather armchair.
Head facing away from Del and toward the defunct television.

A halo of flies overhead, almost angelic.
The husband. Also very old. Also very dead.
The TV remote still locked in his hand.

Del pulls away the surgical mask. Squats down to meet the
rotting corpse face-to-face.

The man’s eyes are marbled over, glazed white.

Del shimmies the remote from the man’s ice-cold hand. Pops
out the batteries. Pockets them.

INT. SECOND HOUSEHOLD - DAY

Del hops over the woman’s body to the trash drawer. Extracts
the garbage bags all at once.

He sweeps up the mess. Scrubs the floor. Collects the doggie
droppings and scattered pet food into the bags.

He yanks the rug out from under the furniture. Tears out the
shower curtain. Wraps the bodies into them, burrito-style.

He pulls the couple’s yellowed wedding portrait from its
frame. They look youthful, happy.

He replaces the empty frame on the bureau.
EXT. SECOND HOUSEHOLD - DAY

Del takes out the trash.

He pauses at the sight of the fat pug dog, sitting eagerly on
the curb. Staring back at him. Tail wagging.

INT. DEL’S TRUCK - DAY

Del loads the bodies into the back of his truck.

The dog’s seated in the passenger seat, gazing out somberly
at the newly sprayed white X on its owners’ lawn.

EXT. WOODS - DAY

Del off-loads the bodies into the dirt.

EXT. WOODS - LATER
Del digs a hole with a well-worn shovel.

The dog watches at his side, panting.

INT. DEL’S TRUCK - DAY
Del returns to his truck. He looks in the side mirror.

The dog’s pacing the woods in circles, sniffing around at the
patch of fresh grave.

Del starts his car.
The dog looks up.
Del turns away. Starts driving.

The dog barks, strained. Chases after the truck with effort,
its stubby legs giving out easily.

Del accelerates, staring forward. The dog’s barking grows
distant in his wake.

He flinches. Takes his foot off the gas. Allows the dog to
catch up to him.

EXT. LIBRARY - DAY

Del dumps a bucket of water over the dog.
He grooms the dog’s nails with a small pair of scissors.

He peeks under the dog’s hood. It’s male. He prints out a
label. Affixes it to the dog’s new collar.

“NAME: DEWEY.”

INT. STREET - DAY
Del walks Dewey on a leash.

Dewey circles a fire hydrant with mild interest.

EXT. BEACH - DAY

Del and Dewey play fetch. Dewey moves very slowly.

INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT

Del eats a home-cooked meal at a cluster of desks, reading a
library book on pet care.

Dewey lingers at his feet. Del feeds him a baby carrot.

INT. CHILDREN’S SECTION - LIBRARY - NIGHT

Del installs Dewey in an enclosed pen outfitted with bean bag
cushions and a bowl of water.

Dewey roams the perimeter, restless. Del exits.

INT. DRUG STORE - DAY

Del picks from an assortment of colorful chew toys. Tests
their squeaking capabilities.

INT. CHILDREN’S SECTION - LIBRARY - DAY

Del returns to Dewey’s pen with a shopping bag filled with
toys and treats.

He stops. The bean bags are TORN APART. Beans EVERYWHERE.
Water bowl OVERTURNED. The pen’s BREACHED... Dewey’s GONE.

Del rounds a corner. A shred of paper catches on his shoe. He
inspects it -- it’s a page from a picture book.

Ripped apart. Destroyed.
He looks ahead. Sees the remnants of an entire stock of
children’s books, all RIPPED to SHREDS.

Del panics. He sinks to his hands and knees. Tries to gather
the scraps and re-order them.

It’s a hollow task. They’re all ruined.
Del starts to tear up.

He turns. Dewey’s gazing at him. Munching on one of the
pages. Unrepentant.

Del takes a deep breath.

INT. DEL’S TRUCK - DAY
Del drives, steadfast.

In the passenger seat: An overflowing trash bag filled with
every last one of the pet supplies.

He peers in the rearview. Dewey stares back at him, curious.

EXT. LIBRARY - NIGHT
Del parks his car for the evening.

He’s alone now.

INT. CHILDREN’S SECTION - LIBRARY - NIGHT
Del surveys the empty space where Dewey’s pen once was.

He smooths out the creases in the carpet.

INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT

Del re-files the books on pet care.

INT. BACK ROOM - LIBRARY - NIGHT
Del watches another old screwball comedy.

He doesn’t laugh. Shuts the laptop.
10.

EXT. SOUND - DAY

It’s a windy day at sea. Del’s sailboat rocks with the waves,
swaying up and down.

Del shrouds himself in a blanket.

INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT

Del eats dinner in silence.

INT. BACK ROOM - LIBRARY - NIGHT

Del stares at the plastic fish in his toy aquarium, swimming
back and forth, smiles etched on their faces.

He turns on his side in the hammock. Tries to sleep.
Just then: A low RASP. Barely audible.

Del perks up. He scrambles to his TRANSISTOR RADIO. Tunes it
to the correct frequency.

The sound sharpens. It’s a VOICE.

WOMAN (0.S.)
Hello?

Del’s eyes widen.

WOMAN (0.S.) (CONT'D)
Can anyone hear me?

Del watches the radio in awe.

WOMAN (0.S.) (CONT'D)
Please. Please, somebody be there.

Del grabs the radio. Holds down the talk button. Opens his
mouth to speak... He falters.

DEL
(weak)
No.
Del takes his finger off the button.

DEL (CONT'D)
No.

He SMASHES the RADIO.
11.

DEL (CONT'D)
No.

He chokes. Hyperventilates. Inhales sharply.

DEL (CONT'D)
Oh god. Oh god.

Suddenly:
BANG. BANG. BANG.
From outside. Sounds like a HAIL of GUNFIRE.

Del BOLTS.

EXT. ROOFTOP - LIBRARY - NIGHT

Del rushes out onto the roof, just in time to catch the
mighty FIREWORKS DISPLAY on the HORIZON.

The night sky is RIDDLED with TECHNICOLOR. The stars flushed
away, overwhelmed by the dramatic BARRAGE of LIGHT and SOUND.

Rockets soaring upward and rippling through the atmosphere,
exploding violently, shredding the heavens... It’s BLINDING.

Del shields his face. Covers his ears. Screams.

His voice is DROWNED OUT.

INT. BATHROOM - LIBRARY - NIGHT

Del barricades the door. Blacks out the window with thick
strips of duct tape, immersing himself in TOTAL DARKNESS.

We can still hear the fireworks in full force outside.

Del locks himself in a stall, curling his knees up into his
chest. He gropes a SWITCHBLADE in his hand.

His grip is shaky, unstable. The knife drops to the floor,
landing with a small CLINK.

Del shuts his eyes. Takes a series of deep breaths.
DEL

(in SOTTO)
Please. Please no.
12.

INT. BACK ROOM - LIBRARY - NIGHT
The radio, smashed into pieces, crackles quietly.
WOMAN (0.S.)
(distorted)
Can you hear me now?

The receiver light fizzles out.

INT. BATHROOM - LIBRARY - DAY
Del wakes up.
It’s quiet outside.

He takes a peek through the window. The skies are clear.

EXT. LIBRARY - DAY

Del sidles out from the library’s double doors.
There’s no one in sight.

He listens closely. Hears a sound, very distant.

It’s a CAR ALARM.

EXT. STREET - DAY
A terrible wreck.

There’s a STATION WAGON up on the curb, FLATTENED under a
felled LAMPPOST. Windshield SMASHED IN. Engine FUMING.

The alarm BLARES.
Del approaches cautiously, knife outstretched.
The driver's incapacitated. Maybe dead.

Del squints for a better look. The driver is female. Almost
certainly the woman from the radio.

He edges closer. She’s young. Late teens or so. Gash on her
forehead. Looks nasty.

Probably dead.

Del opens the car door.
13.

The body slumps out into Del’s arms.
He checks for a pulse... Her eyes flicker open.
They stare at one another.

WOMAN
You're here.

She smiles.
WOMAN (CONT'D)
I’m gonna fuck you into the next
dimension.

She laughs. Slips back into unconsciousness.

Del sets her down in the grass, taking care not to bang her
head. Returns to the car.

The dash is papered with deflated potato chip bags and empty
liquor bottles and stray undergarments.

He looks in the backseat, spots her transistor radio. Her
leftover fireworks. A Polaroid camera. A GameBoy. Two bulging
floral-print suitcases, frayed at the seams.

He pops the glove compartment. Finds a small HANDGUN, buried
among loose papers.

He peers over his shoulder at the young woman splayed out on
the grass. Contemplates his next move.
INT. LIBRARY - DAY

Del unzips the suitcases. Sifts through the wrinkled clothing
and toiletries.

He uncovers a weathered PHOTO of a FAMILY. Taped together in
places -- it looks as if it’s been torn up before.

The girl. Her mother, father, little sister. All smiles.
Underneath, he finds a newer series of overexposed Polaroid
selfies taken at various iconic national landmarks. In each
of them, the girl mugs for the camera with a ridiculous face.
He lingers on a photo taken at the crest of the Grand Canyon.

She's sticking her tongue out at him.

This is GRACE.
14.

INT. BEDROOM - ABANDONED HOUSE - DAY

Grace stirs awake. Her vision stabilizes.

She's in a BEDROOM, sparsely decorated. The windows are
BOARDED SHUT from the outside. A sliver of DAYLIGHT pours in
from a neglected crack.

She sits up with pain. Runs her hand through her hair. Her
forehead’s dressed in layers of GAUZE. It STINGS.

She gets to her feet. Feels DIZZY. Grabs a trash can, digs
her head in. HURLS.

GRACE
Ugh. Fuck me.

She wipes her mouth. Heads to the door. Reaches for the knob.
It’s LOCKED. She RAPS her FISTS on the DOOR.

GRACE (CONT'D)
Hello? Hello--?

Nothing.
She flings open the dresser drawers. They’re all EMPTY.

The room’s been cleaned out completely. The only spare item a
bottle of hand sanitizer on the night stand.

She hears a pair of FOOTSTEPS. Turns back to the door. Sees a
shadow pass across the small round PEEPHOLE.

DEL (0.S.)
Is there anyone else?

GRACE
What’s going on?

DEL (0.S.)
Answer my question, please.

GRACE
What’s your question?

DEL (0.S.)
Is there anyone else?

GRACE
It’s just me in here.

DEL (0.S.)
I know that already.
15.

GRACE
Oh, so it’s my fault your question
was fucking stupid.
The shadow disappears from the peephole.

GRACE (CONT'D)
Wait!

DEL (0.S.)
Is there anybody else?

GRACE
There’s no one else.

DEL (0.S.)
Anywhere?

Grace’s eyes narrow in on the door.

GRACE
Are you not--

DEL (0.S.)
Anywhere?

There’s a hint of panic in his voice.

Grace processes. She exhales slowly.

GRACE
Anywhere.

DEL (0.S.)
It's just you?

GRACE
Just me and you.

DEL (0.S.)
That’s all?

GRACE

Yeah. That’s it. We’re it.
A long pause on the other end.

DEL (0.S.)
Why are you still alive?
16.

INT. HALLWAY - ABANDONED HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Del stands on the other end of the door, watching Grace
through the peephole’s fishbowl POV.

Grace looks directly at him.

GRACE
Why are you?

INT. BEDROOM - ABANDONED HOUSE - DAY
Grace waits. Finally, Del speaks up.

DEL (0.S.)
What about the gun?

GRACE
Gun? Which gun?

DEL (0.S.)
The gun in your glove compartment.

GRACE
Oh, that gun. I found it on the
road a few months back. I figured
maybe it’d come in handy one day.

DEL (0.S.)
Against who?

GRACE
Well... who’s to say they don’t all
come back from the dead and try to
eat our brains?

DEL (0.S.)
That won’t happen.
GRACE
Why not?
DEL (0.S.)

Because it doesn’t happen.

GRACE
And the entire human population of
earth dropping dead in a single
instant on a Tuesday afternoon,
does that not happen either?

No response.
17.

GRACE (CONT'D)
Will you let me out?

DEL (0.S.)
I can’t yet.

GRACE
Come on, man.
(a pause)
I‘1l make it worth your while.

She lets the last word linger.

DEL (0.S.)
I’m going to unlock the door.
That'll cue you to start counting
to fifteen Mississippi. I’1l be
counting too, from farther away.
After fifteen Mississippi you can
open the door. I won’t be here.
Don’t look for me.

GRACE
Hold on.

DEL (0.S.)
There's a car outside, it’s got a
full tank of gas and all your
belongings, minus the gun. You
shouldn’t have that.

GRACE
Dude, what the fuck--?

DEL (0.S.)
You have to leave. You have to
leave and forget you were ever here
and never come back. Please.

GRACE
But... we’re all that’s left.

DEL (0.S.)
I’m going to start counting now.

GRACE
Are you listening to me? I said
we're the only ones still out here!
We’re the sole fuckin’ survivors,
man! You can’t just ghost me like
we're in fucking middle school--!

DEL (0.S.)
One Mississippi.
18.

The doorknob CLICKS.

DEL (0.S.) (CONT'D)
I'm leaving now, two Missi--

Grace opens the door. Meets Del head-on. Smirks.

GRACE
You're tall.

DEL
What are you doing?

GRACE
You sounded shorter.

DEL
Please go back inside and close the
door, this isn’t right. It’s not
what we talked about.

GRACE
You're bossy too. We can work
around that.

DEL
There’s nothing to work around.
You're leaving.

GRACE
You think it’s a coincidence we
found each other?

DEL
No. You were drinking and you
crashed your car on my street.

GRACE
Ah, that’s right.

DEL
It’s not funny. In your drunken
binge you took down a lamppost, and
now I have to fix it. That’s going
to require substantial renovations
and-- and considerable labor--

GRACE
Labor.

DEL
Yes. Manpower.
19.

GRACE
Man-power.

DEL
Stop that.

GRACE

C’mon. You know as well as I do why
He kept the two of us alive.

DEL
Who? Who kept us alive?

Grace points upward.

DEL (CONT'D)
Wow. Okay.

GRACE
Haven’t you ever heard of “be
fruitful and--

DEL
--and multiply,” yes. It’s from the
King James Bible, Genesis 1:28,
call two twenty fifty-two.

GRACE
What’s that?

DEL
It was an English translation
commissioned by King James I in the
early sixteenth century-- or maybe
the seventeenth--

GRACE
Not the Bible, the number.

DEL
Genesis 1:28 is where the passage
appears in the text.

GRACE
The second one. The two-twenty
whatever you said...

DEL
Two twenty fifty-two. It’s the call
number for that edition.

GRACE
Call number?
20.

DEL
Every book has one.

GRACE
They do? Are you sure?

DEL
Yes, I’m very sure. I don’t really
have time to talk to you anymore--

GRACE
Are you retarded or something?

Del SNAPS.

DEL
Fuck off. Okay? Just... please
leave me alone. I have a lot of
work to do today. I’m already
behind schedule, even without
factoring in the lamppost.

GRACE
I can’t believe this.

DEL
The engine’s running in your car.
You're wasting gas.

GRACE
Right. And that’s bad for the
environment.

He gives her a look. She laughs.

DEL

You're making fun of me.
GRACE

No.
DEL

I've gotta go.
He turns to leave. Grace’s smile fades.

GRACE
No. Come on.

Del starts down the stairs.
21.

GRACE (CONT'D)
You're making me feel like I'ma
fucking asshole or-- hey, listen,
I’m sorry-- will you wait a minute?

Del quickens his pace. Grace follows him outside.

EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

Grace steps out into the light. She looks around in awe.

Del hands

She turns

GRACE
Oh my god.

her the car keys. She barely notices.

GRACE (CONT'D)
This is where you live? You really
live here all alone?

DEL
Yes.

GRACE
Where are the bodies?

DEL
Which ones?

GRACE
Which ones? All of them. Everyone
died where they stood, all at once.
No warnings, no symptoms, just--

to Del.

GRACE (CONT'D)
You can barely drive a mile without
getting one of them caught in your
tires. Everywhere you look it’s
just piles and piles of bodies. And
the smell, that god-awful smell
that’s everywhere...

She inhales the cool air.

GRACE (CONT'D)
It’s not here.

DEL
Nope.
GRACE
What happened?

DEL
I buried them.

GRACE
All of them? Alone? That’s
impossible.

DEL

No, it’s just tedious. I started
with the public spaces. The outdoor
areas. Then I moved on to the shops
and restaurants and offices. As of
late I’ve been clearing out the
residences. The town’s population
was 9,539. I’m at 8,840. That’s a
92% clearance rate thus far. It’s
actually 92.6, but I round down.

GRACE
Why?

DEL
Rounding up would be giving myself
more credit than I deserve.

GRACE
No. I mean, why did you bury all
the bodies?

DEL
(matter-of-fact)
They smelled. They were ugly. So I
got rid of them.
Grace thinks.

GRACE
I want to stay.

DEL
That's not possible.

GRACE
Don’t you ever get lonely?

Del cracks a smirk.

DEL
No. I don’t get lonely.
23.

GRACE
You're... you’re telling me you’re
totally fine allowing the human
race to go extinct?

DEL
It’s out of my hands.

GRACE
Did you fall asleep during sex ed?
I’m game, man. DTF. You don’t even
have to buy me dinner first.

She extends her arms outward.

GRACE (CONT'D)
Take me, you bastard.

DEL
Okay. How old are you?

GRACE
Nineteen. I think. It’s been hard
to keep track.

DEL
Great. So the average age of
menopause is fifty-one. That gives
us roughly thirty-two years in
which we can propagate.

GRACE
I love it when you talk dirty.

DEL
Oh, I’m just getting started. Now
best case scenario, my sperm’s
hyper-virile, we max out our
capacity and have you on rotation
twelve months out of the year.

Grace winces.

GRACE
You want to put me on rotation?
Like a cow?

DEL
Don’t look at me. I’m just fleshing
out your repopulation theory to its
logical extreme.

GRACE
Right. Sure.
DEL
Now, assuming none are multiple
births, no twins or triplets in the
mix, that’s forty-two children
maximum. Right? I think that’s
right. We can get a calculator.

GRACE
Oh no, I trust your data.

DEL
Great. So that’s forty-two of our
children that are then obligated to
breed with their siblings to
further procreate. And due to the
heightened risk of developmental
disabilities in inbred children,
our descendants would have a
severely diminished capacity for
survival and would likely die out
within a matter of one or two
generations, max.

GRACE
You don’t know that.

DEL
Of course I do.

GRACE
It worked before.

Del shakes his head.

DEL
I don’t believe in myth. It’s good
literature, that’s all.

GRACE
How can you be so cynical?

DEL
I'm a pragmatist. I recommend it
highly. Good-bye now-- I’m sorry,
what did you say your name was?

GRACE
Grace. Grace Wilkins.

DEL
Good-bye, Grace Wilkins. Best of
luck out there.

Del strolls off.
25.

EXT. LAKE - DAY
Del fills his buckets with water. Grace appears beside him.

GRACE
I can help clear the bodies.

DEL
I don’t need help. I’m 92% done.

GRACE
You'll get done a lot quicker with
an extra pair of hands. And we can
start planning our expansion.

DEL
Expansion?

GRACE
To the next town. And the next one
after that. I bet we can clear the
whole county in no time.

DEL
I’m not interested in clearing the
county or any of the other towns.

He gets to his feet.

DEL (CONT'D)

My obligation starts and ends with
this town. It’s my home. It’s been
my home as long as I’ve lived. The
least I can do is keep it clean.

GRACE
But there’s so much else out there.

DEL
That's a subjective opinion.

GRACE
When was the last time you left?

DEL
I’m not sure how that’s important.

GRACE
That long, huh?

Del doesn’t respond. He hauls the buckets to his truck. Grace
grabs two herself.
26.

GRACE (CONT'D)
I’m staying here whether you like
it or not.

DEL
Why? I’ve been nothing but rude to
you all morning.

GRACE
I’m an extrovert. I wasn’t built to
be alone. You can ignore me all you
want, give me the silent treatment,
whatever. I don’t need to talk to
you. Just let me talk at you.

He looks to her.

GRACE (CONT'D)
I need to know there’s someone else
that can hear me.

INT. LIBRARY - DAY

Del files books with a pair of noise-cancelling headphones
clamped over his ears.

Grace trails. He pays her no mind.

GRACE
(voice raised)

I was making my way up the coast.
My aunt got me this guide of the
fifty U.S. landmarks you need to
see before you die. One per state,
and it ends at Niagara Falls. Have
you been to Niagara Falls--?

He walks right past her into the next aisle.

Grace pulls a book from the nearest shelf and inserts it
elsewhere, out of alphabetical order.

She catches up to Del. Removes his headphones.

GRACE (CONT'D)
You like books?

DEL
Yeah, I do.

GRACE
Me too!
27.

DEL
That’s great.

He fastens the headphones over his ears once more.

GRACE
We should start a book club!

EXT. BEACH - DAY

Grace watches from the shore as Del sails. She polishes off a
beer, crushes the can and chucks it into the water.

She raises one hand to eye level. Pinches the sailboat with
her index and middle fingers.
INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT

Del prepares an intricate sushi platter for himself, complete
with wasabi, ginger and soy sauce.

Grace observes the meal in awe.

GRACE
Are you eating fish?

DEL
It’s salmon sashimi.

He nips at the fish with a pair of chopsticks.

GRACE
Some apocalypse this is.

She gets up. Browses the stacks.
GRACE (CONT'D)
So why do you think it happened?
Why did everyone die like that?
DEL
No use in speculating. I doubt

we'll ever know for sure.

GRACE
Maybe it was the Rapture.

DEL
Maybe. Probably not.

He sucks his chopstick clean.
28.

GRACE
Where were you when it--?

DEL
I was sleeping.

GRACE
You were sleeping at two-thirty on
a Tuesday afternoon?

DEL
I worked nights.
GRACE
Where’d you work?
DEL
Here. I was the night custodian.
GRACE
Huh.
DEL

It wasn’t so bad. My job was to
keep everything in order. I like
doing that. And they let me read
whatever I wanted in my downtime.
It was quiet. It was just me.

Grace turns to him.

GRACE
Didn't you ever feel lonely?

DEL
That’s the second time you've asked
me that.

GRACE
I’m curious.

DEL
You're curious?

He pivots his chair to her.

DEL (CONT'D)
You really want to know when I felt
lonely? I felt lonely when there
were 9,538 other people here, all
of them looking at me like I was
some kind of martian. Keeping their
distance. Whispering to each other.
That’s when I felt lonely.

(MORE )
He stops.

Del nods.

She exits.

Del folds

29.

DEL (CONT'D)
Is that what you wanted to hear?
Was that answer satisfactory, or
would you like to ask me again?

Settles.

DEL (CONT'D)
I didn’t mean to raise my voice.

GRACE

It’s okay. I can leave.
DEL

What?
GRACE

I'll leave you alone. It’s fine.
You've clearly got something good
going here. Good for you, I mean.
You’re happy, and I guess I thought
I could-- I don’t know-- at the end
of the day it’s not fair for me to
put my shit on you. I’m sorry.

Grace forces a smile.

GRACE (CONT'D)
I‘'1l go pack my things.

his napkin.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Grace loads the car with her luggage.

She gets behind the wheel. Stares forward.

Her eyes start to well.

She wipes

She winds

GRACE
Fuck.

them clean with the inside of her sleeve.

GRACE (CONT'D)
Fuck me. Okay.

the key in the ignition. The car sputters to life.

Her foot hits the gas pedal...

A tap on the driver's window.
30.

It’s Del, crouching down to meet her at eye level.

GRACE (CONT'D)
What?

Del cups a hand to his ear. Grace cranks down the window.

GRACE (CONT'D)
What is it?

DEL
You should put on your brights.
It’s dark out there.

GRACE
Oh. Yeah, thanks.

She flicks on the brights.

GRACE (CONT'D)
See you around.

DEL
You don’t have to go just yet.

GRACE
The last thing I need is for you to
feel sorry for me. If I get going
now I think I can make it to
Niagara Falls by sun-up.

DEL
What’s in Niagara Falls?

GRACE
It’s one of the landmarks in my
aunt's guidebook. I was telling you
earlier-- you must’ve had the
headphones on. Anyways, it’s the
last one and then that’s it.

DEL
That’s it?

GRACE
It’s my last landmark.

DEL
What happens after that?

GRACE
What do you mean?
31.

DEL
Once you've reached Niagara Falls.
Where do you go afterwards? Up to
Canada, or--?

Grace shakes her head.

GRACE
Stop.

DEL
Can you answer my question?

GRACE
Why? What does it matter anyway?
It’s not like you care.

DEL
You shouldn’t go to Niagara Falls.
Not yet. You can stay here for a
little while, get your bearings.

GRACE
Stop. Just stop. Please.
DEL
What kinds of movies do you like?
GRACE
Movies?
DEL

We have a great catalogue of DVDs
back at the library. I watch them
on laptops, the portable players,
anything I can get my hands on. You
could borrow one or two of them
sometime. The DVDs, I mean. Drop
them off in the return slot when
you're finished.

(a pause)
Do you like comedies?

GRACE
Yeah. Yeah, I like comedies.

DEL
We've got a whole section that’s
just comedy films. And not just the
mainstream stuff either. Some of
the titles have been out of print
for-- well, I guess they’re all out
of print now, technically.
32.

GRACE
Why are you saying all this? I
thought you wanted to be alone.

DEL
I do. At the moment, your leaving
here and never ever coming back is
a very exciting prospect for me.

GRACE
Thanks.

DEL
But if I’m forced to think about it
long-term, I‘1l admit there’s a
very slim possibility that there
could come a day when I change my
mind and decide that I could do
with some company after all. But by
that point you’d be long gone and
it'd be virtually impossible for me
to ever find you again.

GRACE
Okay?

DEL
There’s a terrifying degree of
permanency there, don’t you think?

GRACE
I guess.

DEL
What I’m trying to say is, if you
leave now our goose is cooked
before it even hatches.

GRACE
Cooked goose sounds pretty tasty
right now.

DEL
I wouldn't know. I’m a pescatarian.

GRACE
Of course you are.

Del shrugs.

DEL
We'll give it a try.
33.
GRACE
Are you sure?
DEL
No, of course I’m not sure. I’m
agreeing to a trial period, during
which time we set a very strict
series of boundaries. As I believe
I've said, I take a great civic
pride in keeping this town
operational, and I can’t risk my
daily routine being disrupted--
Grace gets out of the car. Stares at Del for a long beat.

DEL (CONT'D)
What? What’s wrong?

She gives him a big hug.
Del tenses uneasily in her grip.

GRACE
I don’t even know your name.

DEL
It’s Del.

GRACE
Just Del?

DEL
Yeah. Just Del.
EXT. STREET - DAY

Del rigs a series of cords around the fallen lamppost. He
harnesses them to the back of his truck.

He hops in his car. Nudges the gas.

The lamppost slowly cranes upright.

EXT. DEL’S TRUCK - DAY
Del brakes at the intersection from earlier.

To his surprise, a SECOND CAR wipes right past his, blasting
an upbeat TUNE from the RADIO.

Grace gives a friendly wave. She continues down the road in
the opposite direction.
34.

Del shakes it off. Moves along.

He glances in his rearview. Pulls a u-turn.

EXT. THIRD HOUSEHOLD - DAY

Del sees Grace’s car parked outside of a house with a
bumblebee mailbox.

The lawn is unmarked.

INT. FOYER - THIRD HOUSEHOLD - DAY
Del hastens inside.

DEL
Grace--?

All of a sudden, a LARGE MASS plummets out from the second
floor, TUMBLING like a SLINKY down the STAIRCASE, landing
right at DEL’S FEET.

He looks down. It’s a BODY.

GRACE
Sleep well?

Grace appears at the top of the stairs.

DEL
What are you doing?

GRACE
Clearing the house. I didn’t see a
white X on the lawn, so I figured
it was up for grabs.

She vanishes down a hallway.

GRACE (0.S.) (CONT'D)
I couldn't have picked a better one
to pop my cherry either. This
lady's got loads of good shit. I
think she might be a hoarder.

DEL
Wait a minute.

Grace doubles back into view.

GRACE
Is everything all right?
35.

DEL
No. No, it’s not “all right.”

He meets her halfway up the staircase.

Del sighs.

DEL (CONT'D)
Let’s get one thing straight.
Clearing the houses, that’s my job.
I do that by myself. You see an
unmarked lawn, you stay away.

GRACE
I’m trying to help.

DEL
And I appreciate that. I really do.
But there’s a very particular way
that this needs to get done.

GRACE
That’s fine. Show me what to do.

DEL
Wouldn't you rather just watch a
movie or something?

GRACE
No, I want the civic pride crap.
I'd like to serve as a productive
member of my community.

DEL
Okay. Follow me.

INT. KITCHEN - THIRD HOUSEHOLD - DAY

Del extracts the batteries from an electric can opener. He
drops them into his zip-lock bag.

DEL
Batteries. They’re the single most
important commodity the dead have
to offer.

GRACE
The necrophiliac in me would have
to argue with you.

Del glares at her.
36.

GRACE (CONT'D)
Bad joke.

DEL
This next part is crucial. You
might want to hold your breath.

He removes the trash bag from the garbage drawer. Flings
opens the refrigerator, revealing a menagerie of rotted,
moldy food items.

GRACE
Ugh. So gross.

Del begins emptying the fridge contents into the bag.

GRACE (CONT'D)
What the hell are you doing?

DEL
Cleaning.

GRACE
Why? No one’s ever stepping foot in
this house again after we leave.

DEL
How do I explain this? Okay. In
thermodynamics, there's a term
called entropy. It’s understood as
a measure of disorder, the capacity
for randomness in a given system.

GRACE
I took biology in high school. I
know what entropy is.

DEL
But have you ever considered its
implications? The more entropy in a
system, the more potential for
chaos. Variables upon variables.
Endlessly unpredictable outcomes.
But when you reduce the amount of
entropy in a system...

He strings up the bag with a tight knot.

DEL (CONT'D)
You can control for error. With
every piece of trash we pick up,
that’s one less force for disorder
in the universe.
37.

He hands Grace the bag. Procures another.

DEL (CONT'D)
Now imagine a system with no
disorder whatsoever. In theory you
could predict, with stunning
accuracy, most everything that will
ever happen within that system.

GRACE
It’s like a vacuum.

DEL
It’s exactly a vacuum. And so long
as we’re committed to serving as
agents of order rather than chaos,
it stays that way.

GRACE
But why would you want to know
everything that’s ever gonna
happen? That seems so dull.

DEL
It’s comforting. It gives me peace.
(a pause)
That’s just me though.

He moves on to the next room, leaving Grace to process.

INT. STUDY - THIRD HOUSEHOLD - DAY

Del peruses the bookshelves. He cradles an extensive
handwritten inventory binder in one hand.

GRACE
Can I see that?

DEL
Knock yourself out.

Grace scans the binder. At first glance, it’s countless pages
of utter gibberish.

She squints. Del’s handwriting is neat, albeit microscopic.
Additions are painstakingly scrawled into every margin, along
with corresponding call numbers.

GRACE
How can you read all this? It’s
making me nauseous.

Del smirks.
38.

GRACE (CONT'D)
Seriously, dude. This is more than
a little cuckoo.

DEL
I’m a completist. Having as full a
catalogue as possible is very
important to me.

He picks a book from the shelf. Examines the back cover.
Plops it into his backpack.

GRACE
But you can’t possibly read all
these books. Not in one lifetime.

DEL

Is that a challenge?
GRACE

No. God no.

Del steps back from the shelves.

DEL
You didn’t see anything upstairs,
did you? Any books, larger books,
maybe by her bedside?

GRACE
I wasn’t really paying attention.

DEL
Hm. I’1l be back.

He sprints upstairs.

GRACE
Was there something you were
looking for in particular?

DEL (0.S.)
Yes. At the time of her death, Mrs.
Lipschitz owed the library over

seven hundred dollars in late fees.

GRACE
Holy fuck. How many books did this
lady steal from you?

DEL (0.S.)
One.
39.

INT. BEDROOM - THIRD HOUSEHOLD - DAY
Del searches the bedroom.

GRACE (0.S.)
You charged her seven hundred
dollar late fees on a single book?

He yanks open the bedside drawer. Nothing but old trinkets
and travel brochures.

DEL
This was a special book. Are you
familiar with Tolstoy?

GRACE (0.S.)
Was he the one they stabbed in the
eye with an ice-pick?

DEL
No, that was Trotsky. Leo Tolstoy
was one of the greatest writers to
ever walk the earth.

GRACE (0.S.)
Never heard of him.

DEL
Regardless. Six years ago Mrs.
Lipschitz checked out our best
edition of War and Peace. Call five
eighty-three sixty or so. Fourteen
hundred pages. Leather-bound.

He reaches deep into the recesses of the adjacent closet.

DEL (CONT'D)
She claimed our records were wrong,
that she never checked it out in
the first place. Eventually we were
forced to write it off as a loss.
But I always had a feeling...

No luck. He withdraws his hand.

DEL (CONT'D)
shit.

GRACE (0.S.)
Found it.

Del turns.
40.

DEL
Really?
INT. STUDY - THIRD HOUSEHOLD - DAY
Del returns downstairs.

DEL
Where is it?

Grace nods to a giant tome propping up the sofa’s bum leg.
Del’s face falls.

GRACE
I guess Tolstoy’s not for everyone.

She digs out the book. The sofa collapses on one side.
GRACE (CONT'D)
Here you go. One big, fat copy of
War and Peace.

She hands Del the book. He looks down at it sadly.

DEL
She stretched out the leather.

GRACE
Ready to go?

DEL
Almost.

He bends down, lifts the sofa and replaces the weak leg with
a small wooden block.

DEL (CONT'D)
There.
INT. FOYER - THIRD HOUSEHOLD - DAY

Grace lingers in the house. Through the window behind her, we
catch a glimpse of Del spray-painting the front lawn.

Her gaze lands on an empty picture frame, sitting upright on
the mantelpiece.

She peers out the window. Watches Del work.
41.

EXT. WOODS - DAY

Grace stands at the precipice of a freshly dug grave. Del
prepares to bury the deceased homeowner.

GRACE
Shouldn’t we say a few words?

DEL
We don’t have time.

Grace grabs the shovel from Del’s hands.
GRACE

You knew her. She was a person. Not
just some piece of trash.

DEL

You really believe that?
GRACE

Yeah, I do.
DEL

So all those bodies you saw lying
in the streets, the ones you told
me got caught up in your tires
wherever you went-- you didn’t say
words for any of them, did you?

GRACE
No.
DEL
Exactly.
GRACE
But I held my breath.
DEL
What?
GRACE

Every time I saw one of them I held
my breath for ten seconds. Like I
was driving through a tunnel or
something. If I stopped before ten
seconds I'd make myself start over
from the beginning. It was just
this stupid thing I did. I’m not
even sure why.
42.

DEL
And what happened when you saw
clusters of them all at once?

GRACE
I held for longer.

Del nods.

DEL
Okay.

He straightens his posture. Inhales deeply. Holds.
Grace takes a second to catch on.

She follows his lead.

They wait.

They exhale.

GRACE
Bye, Mrs. Lipschitz.

She lowers the first mound of dirt into the hole.

EXT. LAKE - DAY
Del enjoys a shower by the lake.

Behind him, the water’s surface begins to RIPPLE ever so
slightly. He doesn’t notice.

GRACE
Boo!

Grace POPS OUT from UNDER the WATER.
Startled, Del TOPPLES into a nearby BUSH.
GRACE (CONT'D)
Whoops. Sorry.
INT. GROCERY STORE - DAY

Grace paces the frozen food aisle, all but cleared out. She
frowns at a stray pint of gelato, melted and shriveled.

GRACE
Man. What I wouldn’t give for some
Neapolitan ice cream right now.
43.

At the next aisle over, Del examines the granola selection

with a discerning eye.

DEL
What’s that?

GRACE
You're joking, right? The three
flavors. You know what this is.

DEL
Maybe. I haven’t got much of a
sweet tooth.

GRACE
You're lucky. Since I’ve been on
the road my two primary food groups
are Pop Tarts and potato chips. You
should’ve seen what I looked like
before the apocalypse. No ass
whatsoever. Now? Now I have a donk.

DEL
I hadn't noticed.

Grace reaches the wine and spirits aisle. It’s
a bottle missing.

GRACE
Hey Del, you a big drinker?

DEL
Not so much, no.

GRACE
All right. More for me then.

She clears the tequila shelf.

INT. GREENHOUSE - DAY
Grace admires the plant life.

GRACE
I can’t believe you've been able to
keep these alive for so long.

Del brushes past her, watering a nearby row of

DEL
They're owed most of the credit.
These are the sole survivors of a
particularly harsh winter.

pristine. Not

gardenias.
44,

Grace pokes gently at a bright pink orchid flower.

DEL (CONT'D)
I do my part in feeding them, but
every last plant in this habitat
had to make a case for itself. And
under suboptimal conditions, they
each managed not only to survive
but to thrive. Trust me, they
wouldn’t be here anymore if they
didn’t want to be here.

Grace laughs.

DEL (CONT'D)
What’s funny?

GRACE
I mean, they’re pretty and all, but
you're talking about them like
they're people. They’re just roots
and leaves. They don’t exactly
possess the power of free will--

DEL
Shh. Listen.

Del holds the base of the orchid to Grace’s ear. He sprinkles
a few droplets of water on the soil.

Grace listens as the roots drink. She smiles.

GRACE
They sound happy.

DEL
They are.
EXT. LIBRARY - NIGHT
Grace tears open a bag of popcorn kernels.
She spreads the kernels out onto a sheet of tin foil.

She folds the tin foil into a pouch, affixes it to a stick
and hangs it over a campfire.

A cacophony of low POPS.
45.

INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT

Del powers up one of his laptops, inserts a DVD disc. He
turns to Grace, who munches quietly on a bowl of popcorn.

DEL
Tonight’s film is Africa Screams
from 1949, starring the great Bud
Abbott and Lou Costello. Keep your
eyes peeled for Max Baer and Shemp
Howard in supporting roles.

He takes a breath.
DEL (CONT'D)
The film has a total runtime of
eighty minutes, but we'll enjoy a
brief intermission at forty-five
minutes as we switch to a new
laptop with more battery life.
Grace gives a thumbs-up.

DEL (CONT'D)
Thank you.

He sits down beside Grace. The film begins.

INT. LIBRARY - LATER

Del and Grace watch as Abbott and Costello bumble around the
jungle in ill-fitting safari gear.

Del chuckles heartily at each wisecrack. Grace takes a long
sip from her wine glass.

GRACE
I'll be right back.

Del doesn’t seem to care.

Grace heads off into the stacks. She roams aimlessly, arms
swinging at her sides. Bored.

She stumbles upon a door that reads EMPLOYEES ONLY. A faint
neon blue glow pours out from underneath, soaking her toes.

She inches closer. Opens the door. Peeks her head in.
46.

INT. BACK ROOM - LIBRARY —- CONTINUOUS

Grace wanders inside the makeshift bedroom. Sees the toy
aquarium, the hammock, the pile of laptops.

She probes the space. Her gaze falls on a large stack of
PHOTOGRAPHS hidden in a dark pocket of the room, bound
together with a thick rubber band.

She takes a look at the woman in the first photo.

It’s Mrs. Lipschitz, on vacation in Italy.

The missing photo from the picture frame.

Grace pulls off the rubber band. She sifts through the
photographs one by one.

The first few are familiar to us: the elderly couple's
wedding portrait, the airbrushed nuclear family.

They're the newest in a stack of hundreds.

Grace opens a nearby filing cabinet, revealing an impossibly
comprehensive collection of similar PHOTOGRAPHS...

A town’s worth of people smiling back at her.

EXT. ROOFTOP - LIBRARY - NIGHT

Del and Grace gaze up at the stars from a picnic blanket.

GRACE
I never knew there were so many.
DEL
I did.
GRACE
Why do you keep doing that?
DEL
What?
GRACE

Never mind.
She stretches out on the blanket.

GRACE (CONT'D)
You know I used to pray every night
before I went to sleep?

(MORE )
47.

GRACE (CONT'D)
Me and my sister, we’d kneel down
at our beds, clamp our fingers
together and we'd pray. My parents
too. Real ride-or-die God-fearing
folk, we were. My dad was a pastor.
He died on the toilet. I’m not
really sure what that means...

Del turns to her.

DEL
Do you still believe?

GRACE
I have no idea. I’m in the market
if you’ve got anything good.

Del shrugs.

DEL
Just the basic thermodynamics.
GRACE
Y'know, Del, I envy you.
DEL
Why?
GRACE

You were asleep. All you had to do
was wake up, walk outside and find
the world changed.

DEL
I guess.

GRACE
Yeah. Must have been nice.

She chugs her wine bottle dry. Sets it off to the side.
GRACE (CONT'D)
I'll bet it never even crossed your
mind what I was doing when it
happened.

DEL
I figured it’d be impolite to ask.

Grace grins stupidly. She’s drunk.

GRACE
I was with a boy.
48.

She gives Del a knowing glare.
He slides away from her.

DEL
It’s getting late.

GRACE
You don’t want to hear my story?

DEL
Maybe tomorrow.

Grace edges closer.

GRACE
You ever fuck a girl in the back of
your truck? Pull her panties down
over her knees, take her from

behind--?
DEL

Come on. Don’t do that.
GRACE

What?
DEL

Don’t take this to a vulgar place.
We were having a good time.

GRACE
I can get you off.

DEL
That’s a bad idea.

GRACE
Oh, I think it’s an excellent idea.

She reaches for him. He gets to his feet.
Grace’s smile fades.

GRACE (CONT'D)
What’s wrong?

DEL
You’ve had too much to drink.

GRACE
I know what I’m doing. You don’t
have to treat me like a child.
49.
DEL
Then stop acting like one.
Grace stands up.
GRACE
I get that you’re nervous. It’s
okay. I can help you.
DEL
You should get some sleep. We have

a long day ahead of us tomorrow.

GRACE
Wait.

DEL
Take any of the marked houses. The
doors are unlocked.

He disappears inside.

INT. BACK ROOM - LIBRARY - NIGHT
Del paces the room, breathing quickly.
His face grows FLUSH. His hands ball into FISTS.

DEL
Fuck. Fuck you. Piece of shit--!

He HURLS a dead laptop AGAINST THE WALL, where it SMASHES
into PIECES. Takes ANOTHER. SNAPS the thing in HALF. KICKS
AWAY at his PILE. Parts go FLYING.

He stops. Draws the air back into his lungs with effort.
Allows his heartbeat to settle, matching the soft pulse of
the toy aquarium’s neon blue glow.

He glances down at the floor. Assesses the damage.

The room’s a MESS.

Del shakes his head. Bends down. Starts cleaning.

INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT
Grace listens from outside the door, lips pursed.

She exhales coolly. Takes off.
50.

INT. BATHROOM - LIBRARY - DAY
Del brushes his teeth. Spits.

His eyes are lined with dark circles.

EXT. LIBRARY - DAY
Del walks out into the daylight.

He searches the block. No sign of Grace anywhere.

INT. BEDROOM - NEW HOUSE - DAY

Grace changes into a sweatshirt. Stuffs stray belongings into
her suitcase. Forces the old thing closed. Zips.

She examines the tattered photo of her family. Folds it
gently into her back pocket.

She peers out the northernmost window. Sees the library
across the street. Sees Del.

He’s standing on the curb, searching. He looks uneasy.
Grace’s eyes dart to her suitcase. Back outside.

To her surprise, Del’s staring directly up at her.

He chances a wave from the curb.

Grace thinks.

She waves back.

INT. BASEMENT - FOURTH HOUSEHOLD - DAY

Pairs of HANDPRINTS coat the walls in UV green and purple.
All shapes and sizes. Glow in the dark, psychedelic basement
decor. The only hint of life in this otherwise shadowy tomb.
From above, the door CREAKS OPEN.

A beam of LIGHT streaks through the dark abyss, exposing the
musk and rotting vapor below.

Grace descends the stairs with caution.

We catch quick glimpses of her face, in green and purple
hues, as she passes the glowing handprints.
51.

She reaches blindly. Knocks over a lava lamp.

She aims her flashlight down at her feet. The shards of
broken glass. The wax congealed in a fat, solid glob.

It almost sounds like it’s wheezing.
From upstairs:

DEL (0.S.)
Everything all right?

GRACE
Yeah. I’m good.

She bends down and removes the batteries from the base of the
broken lamp.
EXT. SOUND - DAY

Multiple fishing rods perch from the rim of Del’s sailboat,
each with a line cast out to sea.

Del glares up from his book. Grace sits across from him in a
bathing suit top and floppy hat, engrossed in a magazine.

She turns the page. Adjusts her aviators. Ignores Del.
Del resumes his own reading.

Suddenly, the rod at Grace’s side WOBBLES.

She lowers her magazine. Looks to Del.

The line TIGHTENS. The rod‘’s SLIPPING.

Del’s eyes widen.

DEL
Go--!

Grace LUNGES for the ROD, the sunglasses FLYING from her
face. She GRINDS IN the REEL...

Another line CATCHES. Del SPRINGS to ACTION.

INT. STAFF KITCHEN - LIBRARY - NIGHT
Del filets a tuna with a sharp knife.

He cuts the hunk of fish into small slices.
52.

INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT
Del and Grace eat an elaborate sushi dinner.

Grace maneuvers her chopsticks awkwardly, struggling to find
the right grip on the slippery fish.

Del watches her with mild amusement, using his own pair with
an expert’s dexterity.

Grace succeeds in guiding the tuna over her sauce tray. She
gives Del a self-satisfied smirk.

Her chopsticks’ hold FALTERS. The tuna PLOPS into the tray,
DRENCHING HER in SOY SAUCE.

Grace sighs. She looks up at Del.

Del neatly sets his own chopsticks aside. Reaches for the
fish with his bare hands.

Grace smiles. Abandons her chopsticks. Digs in.

INT. LIBRARY - LATER
Del and Grace watch another old comedy.

On the screen, some poor buffoon topples down a flight of
stairs and lands in a trash can.

Grace’s eyes shift to Del. He’s laughing. She follows his
cue. Erupts in a belly laugh. Oversells it.

Del turns to her, startled.

EXT. BEACH - DAY
Del and Grace play a spirited game of ping-pong.

They’re both oddly adept. The ball zooms back and forth over
the net, their strokes intensifying with each volley.

Del hits a pop-up. Grace goes in for the kill. Puts it away.
Throws her fists overhead in victory.
INT. GREENHOUSE - DAY

Grace scatters seeds in a pot of soil. She adorns the pot
with a smiley-face sticker.

Nearby, Del picks heirloom tomatoes from one of his plants.
53.

INT. BACK ROOM - LIBRARY - DAY

A finely detailed town map hangs on the wall. Each of the
cleared lots is marked with a white xX.

INT. LIVING ROOM - FIFTH HOUSEHOLD - DAY

Grace tosses Del a rolled-up trash bag, javelin-style. He
catches it with one hand.

EXT. FIFTH HOUSEHOLD - DAY

Grace pushes a wheelbarrow packed with corpses across the
front lawn. She winds past Del, who mows the grass.

INT. LIBRARY - DAY

Del files new books into the collection.

Grace whirls behind him on a hoverboard, leafing through a
dense manual on solar energy.

EXT. ROOFTOP - LIBRARY - DAY

Del and Grace attempt to install a set of solar panels on the
roof. They prove increasingly unwieldy.

EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY

Del teaches Grace how to drive the street sweeper.

She SLAMS her FOOT on the GAS. The vehicle HURTLES FORWARD,
nearly RAZING another LAMPPOST.

EXT. YARD - DAY

Grace chases after a stray chicken.

Panicked, the chicken averts Grace’s clutches.

EXT. PARK - DAY
Del and Grace eat scrambled eggs on a park bench.

Grace offers a bite to the chicken, who nips at it happily.
54.

INT. ROOFTOP - LIBRARY - DAY

Del adjusts the angle on one of the solar panels.

INT. LIBRARY - DAY
Grace reads a magazine, feet propped up on the table.
Overhead, a single light bulb SPARKS TO LIFE.

Grace stares up in awe. Basks in the artificial glow.

INT. BACK ROOM - LIBRARY - DAY

The white Xes multiply across the map.

EXT. STREET - DAY

Grace rides her bike through the neighborhood. Every lawn is
marked, some of the Xes paled with time.

She stops for a quick stretch. Notices something strange off
in the distance. Squints for a better look.

Directly beyond her lies a DRIVEWAY partially obscured by a
curtain of overgrown WEEDS. Blending into the scenery.

Grace wheels her bike forward. Pushes past the weeds.

The driveway is ripe with cracks and fissures, a bedrock of
greenery fighting its way out from underneath. The path ends
at the foot of a decrepit HOUSE.

The front door dangles off its hinges. Windows shattered.
Lawn unkempt with tufts of dead grass.

Grace whips out her RADIO.

GRACE
Del? I found something. Over.
She waits.
GRACE (CONT'D)
Come in, Del. I’m on Putnam Avenue,
off of Young O. Over.
Static.

Grace holsters her radio. She approaches the house slowly,
abandoning her bike on the ground.
55.

INT. LAST HOUSEHOLD - DAY

Grace wipes past a veil of cobweb. Sidesteps overturned
furniture, long decayed and worn through by termites.

Among the ruins: Dead plants strewn across the coffee table.
Early ‘80s-era television with the screen bashed in. A
goldfish lying belly-up on the surface of muck green water.

EXT. BACKYARD - LAST HOUSEHOLD - DAY

Grace wanders into the backyard, which sits at the threshold
of a vast wooded wilderness.

She navigates the minefield of crushed beer cans, cigarette
butts and crumpled trash. An empty can of lighter fluid.

Her eyes are drawn to the grill. Caught between the grates
are charred flecks of paper. The mutilated remains of pages,
covers, bindings... They’re BOOKS. Or were.

Grace turns. She comes face-to-face with a MAN, stooped in a
plastic lounge chair on the patio.

He stares directly at her. His eyes are a pair of lifeless
orbs, glazed translucent white. His mouth hangs open,
showcasing a set of rotten teeth.

Grace absorbs the gruesome sight.

Her gaze strays downward. She spots a lone photograph, old
and faded, discarded among the garbage and dead leaves.

It’s a BOY, pre-teen, standing at the edge of a lake.
The same lake Del frequents.
His eyes are closed.

DEL (0.S.)
This is Millburn. Not Putnam.

Grace looks up. Sees Del.

DEL (CONT'D)
I told you not to go into any of
the unmarked houses alone. I told
you that.

GRACE
I’m sorry.
56.

DEL
You were never supposed to be here.

GRACE
We can clean it up. We can clear it
together, just like the others.

DEL
I don’t want it cleared. This house
doesn’t get cleared.

He shifts his gaze to the man in the lawn chair. His mouth
twists into a grimace.

DEL (CONT'D)
This makes no fucking sense.

GRACE
It’s just a house.

DEL
Not the house. You. You were never
supposed to be here in the first
place. It was just-- it was just
supposed to be me.

GRACE
What?

DEL
This, all of this, it wasn’t ever
the Rapture or the bubonic plague
or any of that. How do you not get
it by now?
(a pause)
It was me.

Grace’s head stirs.

GRACE
What are you talking about?

DEL
I wanted them all to go away. I
wanted them to leave me alone and
be gone forever. That’s what I
wished for. And that’s how it
happened.

He sniffs in the cool air.
57.

DEL (CONT'D)
I closed my eyes and I concentrated
with every fiber of my brain and I
wished for this. Exactly this.

GRACE
Del.

DEL
It’s like you said. Afterwards all
I had to do was wake up and find
the world changed.

He laughs to himself. Grace stares at him.

DEL (CONT'D)
I had it all worked out. It all
made so much sense. Until you. See,
for the life of me I can’t seem to
wrap my head around just why in
hell you're still here too.

He shifts his balance. Rocks back and forth on his toes.

DEL (CONT'D)
You know the first thing I saw when
I woke up that day? The playground
behind the old elementary school.
Same school I went to as a kid.
They were out for recess.

His eyes start to mist.

DEL (CONT'D)
I couldn't just leave them there
like that. What kind of person
would-- who would--

He falters. Grace takes a step toward him.

GRACE
You didn’t do this.

DEL
I did. I did it.

GRACE
No you didn’t. Because then you'd
really be all alone. I’d be dead
with the rest of them.

Del smiles sadly, lips pursed.
58.

DEL
Yeah.

GRACE
Mhm.

Grace kicks into high gear. Claps her hands together. Ties
her hair up in a ponytail.

GRACE (CONT'D)

Now I don’t know about you, but I’m
gonna clear this house. I’m gonna
pave the driveway and pick up the
trash and... and scrub the walls
till they shine like the fucking
Chrysler Building.

DEL
Why?

GRACE
Because that’s what we do. We
clear. Right?
Del nods.
GRACE (CONT'D)
Right. Now let’s pick up the pace,
we've got a schedule to maintain.
She returns inside, a skip in her step.
Del lingers in the backyard, his gaze fixed on the shreds of
paper in the grill.
INT. VARIOUS - LAST HOUSEHOLD - DAY

Grace swiffers the floors. Collects the garbage. Sews up the
tears in the furniture fabric.

She rolls a coat of white paint over the graffitied walls.

She purges the contents of the refrigerator. The pantry
shelves. The dirty dishware in the sink.

Among them is a cracked ceramic bowl, hand-painted with a
child’s watercolor illustrations.

She turns. Del’s holding the trash bag open for her.
59.

EXT. BACKYARD - LAST HOUSEHOLD - DAY

Del and Grace heave the man’s petrified corpse from the
lounge chair into an open body bag.

Grace musses back the man’s unruly hair.

Del zips the bag shut.

EXT. DEL’S TRUCK - DAY

Del and Grace ride in silence.

EXT. WOODS - DAY
Del slides the body into a fresh grave.
He looks to Grace. She digs the shovel into the earth.

DEL
Wait.

He peers down into the hole.

He inhales through his nose.

Grace does the same.

Ten seconds pass.

They exhale through their mouths simultaneously.

GRACE
Is that all?

DEL
Yeah. That’s all.

He takes the shovel. Starts burying.

EXT. WOODS - LATER
Del marches back to the truck. Grace catches up to him.

GRACE
Del?

He whisks around to face her.

She takes hold of his hand. Clasps it tight.
60.
He glares down tensely at their intertwined fingers. Looks
back up at Grace. She’s staring deep into his eyes.
They’re inches apart now.
Del pulls her in close. Kisses her.

He withdraws quickly.

DEL
I’m sorry.
GRACE
Why?
He thinks.
DEL

I don’t know.

INT. BEDROOM - GRACE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Del’s asleep. Peaceful.

Grace lies beside him, wide awake.

She veers away from him. Stares ahead solemnly.

In the distance, we hear the very faint hum of a CAR ENGINE.

EXT. SOUND - DAY

The sun edges slowly over the horizon. The first rays of
daylight flicker off the ocean’s surface.

INT. BEDROOM - GRACE’S HOUSE - DAY

Del’s eyes sway open.

He shifts to Grace’s side of the bed.

She’s not there.

Del checks his watch. Gets up. Gathers his clothes.

He hears a series of murmurs through the wood panelling in
the floor. Vaguely distorted. Coming from downstairs.

It’s a voice. But it’s too low to be Grace’s.

He listens closer. The voice is MALE.
61.

INT. STAIRWELL - GRACE’S HOUSE - DAY
Del pads down the stairs.
The man’s voice grows sharper.
MAN (0.S.)
That’s amazing. That’s really
tasty. Is that cilantro?

Del approaches the dining room. He sees Grace seated at the
table, her back to him.

MAN (0.S.) (CONT'D)
Hello?
GRACE
Yes.
MAN (0.S.)
It is cilantro?
GRACE
Yes.
MAN (0.S.)

I knew it. Just like they have back
at the club. Cee-lan-tro. Mm.

Del stops in the doorway. Grace turns to him.

A full breakfast spread out on the table. Scrambled eggs and
hash browns. Three place settings.

Three people.

Across from Grace, a MAN and a WOMAN, both late 40s. Napkins
folded neatly into their laps.

They exchange a quick look with one another.

MAN (CONT'D)
Hi there!

The man gets up from his chair. His collared shirt is tucked
into his pants, girding a beer belly.

MAN (CONT'D)
Grace didn’t mention she had
company. I’m Miles. Miles Mercer.
Miles extends his hand outward.

Del stares past him.
62.

MILES
This is my wife Violet.

Violet smiles politely. Del doesn’t reciprocate.
Miles lowers his hand. He cranes his head to Grace.

MILES (CONT'D)
He’s not deaf, is he?

GRACE
No.

VIOLET
I think maybe he feels we're
encroaching.

MILES
Ah. Well, we certainly didn’t mean
to cause any trouble. We’ll be out
of your hair just as soon as we’re
done with our breakfast.

Del glares up at him. He nods.
MILES (CONT'D)
Would you care to join us? Grace
here prepared one hell of a meal.
It'd be a shame to see it go cold.

VIOLET
Don’t be shy. Have a seat.

Del sits at the table, his nerves flaring.
MILES
(to Grace)
Go on. Make him a plate.

Del peers over at Grace. She avoids him.

MILES (CONT'D)
Grace.

Grace abruptly grabs a plate. Shovels it full of eggs.

MILES (CONT'D)
So what’s your name?

DEL
Del.

MILES
Del what?
63.

DEL
Just Del.

MILES
Come on. Del’s the name of my
laptop. It’s gotta be short for
something, hasn't it? Let’s see.
Stop me when I’ve got it. Delroy?
Delbert? Delano--?

DEL
I’m just Del.

MILES
Well, if you say so.

Violet turns to Del. She speaks slowly.
VIOLET

This is a lovely town, Del. Do you
live here all on your own?

DEL
Until recently. Yes.
VIOLET
And your bodies?
DEL
Buried.
VIOLET

That’s nice.

MILES
It’s like exactly how we do in
Houston, isn’t it? Albeit on a much
smaller scale-- I’m sure Grace’s
told you all about Houston--

Del flinches.

MILES (CONT'D)
Did I say something wrong?

DEL
(to Grace)
Who are they?

Grace gazes down at her plate.
MILES

Well, we’re the Mercers. I think we
already covered that.
64.
VIOLET
Grace, don’t bite your fingernails.
Grace retracts her hands from her mouth.
MILES
So Del, what exactly are your

intentions with our daughter?

Del tightens.

GRACE
Excuse me.
She gets up.
MILES
Sit down.

She does so, reluctantly.

MILES (CONT'D)
(to Del)

You seem surprised. Has Grace not

told you about us?

Miles turns to Grace.

MILES (CONT'D)
She's never once mentioned having
had parents? No? Didn’t come up?

DEL
I don’t understand.

MILES
What’s there to understand? Grace
is our daughter. I’m her father.
Vi's her mom. She’s our baby girl.

Del processes this. They’re not the family from Grace’s
photo. Not by a long shot.

DEL
Are you sure?

MILES
What kind of a question is that? Of
course I’m sure. Tell him, Grace.

Grace stares forward blankly.

MILES (CONT'D)
Come on. Set him straight.
GRACE
They’re my parents.

MILES
I don’t think he heard you. You're
gonna have to speak up.

GRACE
(louder)
They’re my parents.

Miles nods, satisfied.

MILES
Honey, why don’t you go upstairs
and pack your bags? It’s a long
ride back, and I’m playing in the
tournament on Sunday.

DEL
Tournament?

VIOLET
Miles is an excellent golfer.

MILES
You don’t play, do you, Del?

Del’s head stirs.

MILES (CONT'D)
You should consider taking it up.
Back in Houston we have quite the
league going.

DEL
Who?

MILES
What do you mean, who?

GRACE
I’1l go pack.

MILES
Wait a second.

GRACE
I need to go to the bathroom.

MILES
You can hold it.

65.
66.

DEL
Who else is there?

MILES
Where? You mean... you don’t know?

DEL
Don’t know what?

Miles assesses Del, eyebrow arched.

VIOLET
You’ve been alone here all this
time? You haven’t-- haven’t left--?

MILES
Didn't go out looking for other
survivors...? Nothing like that?

DEL
No.

He glares across the table at Grace. She can’t bring herself
to look back at him. The color drained from her face.

MILES
So you've been in this town all
along, all on your own-- and as far
as you knew you were the last man
left on earth till we showed up for
scrambled eggs.

Miles laughs to himself.

VIOLET
Miles.

MILES
I’m sorry. It’s just, you really
can’t come up with this stuff.

VIOLET
We're still his guests.

DEL

There are more of you?
(to Grace)
You told me--

MILES
What did she tell you, exactly?

Del turns to Miles.
67.

DEL
That no one else had survived. That
it was just the two of us.

MILES
Now why would she go and say
something like that?

Grace averts his gaze.

MILES (CONT'D)
Two? Try hundreds. Thousands, even.
And that’s just in Houston. We've
got a settlement in Dallas too.

Del shuts his eyes. Tries to tune him out.

MILES (CONT'D)
Every day brings new faces. We have
signs up on practically every major
highway. You can’t miss ‘em.

VIOLET
I designed some myself.

MILES
Violet’s a graphic artist.

VIOLET
Well, I’m no Rembrandt or anything.
I used to freelance for Ackerman
Agency in San Diego, California. Of
course, that was in my twenties...
I'm rambling, aren’t I?

MILES
In any case, you’d be amazed to
hear all we’ve accomplished in
Dallas. We're rebuilding America,
one sector at a time.

DEL
Stop.

MILES
We got the lights turned back on.
Got the Internet up and running
again. Phones. Power plants. Basic
currency. You name it. We even
recycle. Hell, we’re just about
more eco-conscious than ever--

DEL
Stop.
Del gets up from his chair.

DEL (CONT'D)
It’s time for you to leave.

He glances over at Grace.

DEL (CONT'D)
All of you.

He exits. Miles looks around the table.

MILES
Huh. Guess he’s not a recycler.

He helps himself to Del’s plate.

EXT. GRACE’S HOUSE - DAY
Grace rushes after Del.

GRACE
I’m sorry.

Del ignores her. Keeps walking.

GRACE (CONT'D)
They’re not good people. You can’t
believe what Miles says. The world
they live in, it’s different from
the way things were. It’s not--

DEL
Are they your parents?

GRACE
I met them in Houston. They had
some kind of fucked-up adoption
program. You really don’t
understand what it’s like down
there-- I had to run away--

DEL
You lied to me.

GRACE
I had to.

DEL
Why?

GRACE

You would’ve never let me stay.
69.

DEL
And fuck you?

GRACE
I know. I know it looks bad. But
after I left Houston I was on the
road for months-- I hadn’t seen
anyone else in all that time. Let
alone in a place like this. I don’t
know what I was thinking.

DEL
You're a teenager.

GRACE
I’m nineteen.

Del pauses mid-stride.

DEL
This is all my fault. I let you in
here. I trusted you.

GRACE
No.

DEL
Y'know, this is kind of funny. It’s
really actually very funny.

He bites his lip. Stares Grace in the eyes.
DEL (CONT'D)
I think you’re the worst mistake

I’ve ever made.

GRACE
Don’t say that.

DEL
You should go. I really need for
you to go.

GRACE
You don’t mean that. You don’t.

Del shakes his head.

DEL
Go home, Grace.

GRACE
Fuck you.
70.

DEL
Uh-huh.

GRACE
I’m serious. You're a selfish
fucking prick and all you care
about is lame old movies and-- and
the Dewey fucking Decimal System.
You shouldn’t even be allowed to
call yourself a person. You’re a
robot. You're a fucking robot
incapable of human emotion. And you
know what? It’s really sad.

She catches her breath.

GRACE (CONT'D)
Do you have anything to say?

DEL
Not really.

GRACE
Okay.

She makes for the house.

DEL
Wait.

She stops.

DEL (CONT'D)
What was the gun for?

Grace looks back at him.
Her eyes are glistening.

GRACE
You don’t--

The door opens. MILES steps out onto the porch.
MILES
Sweetie, we’re just about ready to
hit the road. If there’s anything
else you wanted to take with you--?
Grace hesitates.

GRACE
I’m coming.
71.

She brushes past Miles into the house.

MILES
How’s that for hustle?

Miles flashes a friendly smile at Del.
Del turns away. He walks back to the library in silence.

Miles’s smile dissipates.

INT. LIBRARY - DAY

Del works his way through a backlog of unsorted books, a
welcome distraction.

He inputs letters and numbers into his handheld label maker.
A new label sputters from his device with a protracted BEEP.
He smooths it over a book’s spine...

MILES (0.S.)
You busy?

Del looks up, startled. Miles leans casually against the
stacks, hands in his pockets.

DEL
Yes.

MILES
Okay, don’t mind me then. I’m just
looking to borrow an audiobook or
two for the ride. I’1l be cooped up
with two women for twenty-plus
hours, Lord help me.

DEL
Sorry. The collection’s private.

He wheels a cart into the stacks. Begins filing.

MILES
C’mon. You've got the print copies
already, I’m sure. It’s just one
audiobook. Give me Tuesdays with
Morrie or something, I don’t care.

DEL
I’m sorry.

Miles smirks.
72.

MILES
It’s cool. I get it. There’s this
funny thing I do, when I’m in the
bathroom and the toilet paper's,
like, facing the wrong way on the
hook-- you know, it’s supposed to
be facing out, easy access-- I’ve
always gotta put it back on the
right way. It’s just one of those
things that freaks me out, y’know?
Drives me up the friggin’ wall--

DEL
What does toilet paper have to do
with books?

MILES
I’m just saying, I can appreciate a
man who values order. It’s a hell
of an attractive quality in a man.

He gets in Del’s space. Breathes out a heavy sigh.

MILES (CONT'D)
You ever get sad sometimes?

DEL
No. Excuse me.

Del separates himself, moves on to the next aisle. Miles
lingers behind, kicking at the floor.

MILES
I just-- I feel like I can talk to
you, Del. Like you of all people
might understand what I’m going
through. The world can feel like
such a messy place. A man needs to
be able to wield some control over
his surroundings. And I look at you
and your set-up here, and I see a
guy who’s got it all figured out.

DEL
We all do what we need to do.

Miles appears beside him, snapping his fingers.

MILES
Right. See, that’s exactly right.
But don’t you wish everybody could
see things as simply as you do?
73.

DEL
Here everybody does.

MILES
Oh, I get it. Because it’s just
you. That’s really good. Like I
said, smart fuckin’ guy.

He presses a finger to his temple.

MILES (CONT'D)

Y'know, we could use a guy like you
back in Houston. Yeah, I’11l tell
you, a guy with your talents would
fit right in there. You could be a
part of something really special,
really cutting-edge...

DEL
No thanks.

Miles stares at him for a prolonged beat. He cracks a smile.
MILES
Aw. Well, you can’t blame me for
trying. Keep up the good work, Del.
You've made a fan out of me.
He hands Del a business card.

MILES (CONT'D)
Just in case you change your mind.

He gives Del a sturdy pat on the shoulder, nearly knocking
him off-balance. He wanders off.

Del waits for Miles to exit. He glances down at the thick
card stock, embossed gold lettering:

MILES Q. MERCER
REALIGNMENT SPECIALIST

He crumples the card in his pocket. Returns to his books.

INT. BEDROOM - GRACE’S HOUSE - DAY

Grace strides into her bedroom. She finds Violet rifling
through her suitcase, examining her clothes.

VIOLET
You've got some really cute new
tops here. You’ll have to let me
borrow them sometime.
74.

GRACE
What are you doing?

VIOLET
I have to teach you how to fold
your clothes. You just ball them up
like they’re garbage. It damages
the material.

GRACE
You can’t just go through my things
like that. You’re not my--

Violet turns to face her.

VIOLET
Not your what?

Grace falters.

VIOLET (CONT'D)
Is everything all right, honey? You
sound stressed.

GRACE
I’m okay.

VIOLET
Really? Are you sure?

She holds out the PHOTO of GRACE and HER FAMILY.
Grace’s eyes go hollow.

GRACE
Give it back.

VIOLET
This isn’t healthy behavior, Grace.
Running away from home, making us
chase after you to the ends of the
earth. What would your father say
if he saw this picture?

GRACE
Please.

VIOLET
No. I’m sorry. No.

Violet tucks the photo into her bra.
75.

VIOLET (CONT'D)
I had another daughter once. You
know, before. It’s wrong to bring
it up, I know that...

She shakes her head.

VIOLET (CONT'D)
I can’t lose you again. I won't.

GRACE
Violet.
VIOLET
Mom.
Grace tightens.
GRACE

You know what’1l happen to me if I
go back there. You know what
they’11 do to me.

VIOLET
You act like it’s such a bad thing.

GRACE
I’m scared.

VIOLET
Don’t be. I’m here for you.

She wraps her arms around Grace. Brings her in close.

VIOLET (CONT'D)
Everything will stop hurting soon.

Grace, head pressed firm against Violet’s chest, listens to
the beating of her heart.
EXT. GRACE’S HOUSE - DAY

Miles loads Grace’s bags into the trunk of his Cadillac. He
sidles into the driver’s seat. Honks the horn.

Violet emerges from the house, Grace in tow.
Grace pauses. She looks across the street.
The library sits still. No sign of life.

Violet takes Grace by the arm. Ushers her into the backseat.
76.
VIOLET
Buckle up.

Violet hops in the passenger’s seat. Gives Miles a peck on
the cheek. Miles shifts the car into drive.

Grace takes a last look at the library.

He’s not coming.

Miles abruptly hits the gas. SCREECH...

The car peels down the street, zigs at the corner, disappears
from view. A cloud of exhaust looming in its wake.

INT. BACK ROOM - LIBRARY - DAY

Del eyes a photograph in his hands.

We reverse to see: It’s the POLAROID of GRACE sticking her
tongue out at the Grand Canyon.

He places the photo in his filing cabinet, the newest in his
collection. Slides the drawer SHUT.

His gaze wanders to the town map on his wall. It’s cluttered
with white Xes. Not an empty lot to be found.

100% clearance.

He runs his hand along the map’s surface. Reaches the top.
TEARS IT DOWN in ONE SWIFT MOTION.

EXT. SOUND - DAY

Del coasts out to sea on his sailboat.

He listens as the waves beat gently against the boat’s hull.
The only sound for miles.

He stares ahead at the horizon.

INT. GROCERY STORE - DAY
The door jingles as Del strides in.

He stops at the liquor aisle. Processes the multitude of
untouched bottles, all coated over in dust.
77.

EXT. ROOFTOP - LIBRARY - DAY

Del cracks open a bottle of vodka. Raises it to his mouth.
Chugs. Chugs. Chugs.

He chokes. Erupts in a coughing fit. Lets the bottle drop to
the ground, shattering at his feet.

His eyes are watery. Bloodshot.

He teeters his way to the solar panel. Paws at it with both
hands. Rends it from its hinges.

EXT. STREET - DAY

Del urinates on a patch of lawn. Crudely traces the spray-
painted lines of the white X. Hums a tune to himself.

He hasn’t shaved in days.

EXT. LAST HOUSEHOLD - DAY

Del staggers down the unpaved street. Surveys the sad house
at the end of the driveway.

He reaches sloppily into his waistband... Draws the HANDGUN
from Grace’s glove compartment.

He cocks the gun with effort. Steadies his aim. His finger
curls the trigger...

BANG. A window BURSTS INTO PIECES.
He feels the rush. He fires again. Again. Again.

The gunshots echo through the empty wood. Birds flee to the
skies, squawking in excitement.

He keeps snapping the trigger long after the chamber’s
expended. His face twisted into something awful.

He chucks the gun at the house.

DEL
Fuck--!

He loses his balance. Lands squarely in the dirt.

DEL (CONT'D)
Fuck you. Fucking...
78.
He tries to get up. His world is SPINNING... His legs give
out underneath him. He falls right back down.

He’s filthy. Drenched from head to toe in mud and glass and
snot and shit. Blistered. Bleeding.

It’s not a good look.

Slowly, he reclaims his wits. Focuses on breathing. Staccato
and irregular grows deep and pronounced.

Regaining consistency. Or a measure thereof.

He cups his hands together. Spits. Rubs down his eyes with
his palms... His vision begins to steady... He hears a BARK.

He tilts his head up. Perks his ears. Listens.
Just then: A second BARK. Low. Strained.

But definitely there.

He looks forward. His eyes narrow.

A few yards away, we can just barely make out the hazy
outline of a DOG... A fat, old PUG.

It’s Dewey.

Del stares in awe, speechless. The corners of his mouth
threatening the slightest of smiles.

He chances a blink. Looks again.
The dog’s gone. Disappeared without a trace.

Del processes, dumbfounded.

INT. BACK ROOM - LIBRARY - NIGHT
Del ransacks his stockpile of battery-operated gadgetry.

At long last, he locates his transistor radio. Mangled from
the earlier abuse. Taped together. Still workable.

He powers it up. Puts his mouth to the receiver.

DEL
Hello?

He listens. Hears STATIC. Toggles to the next frequency.
79.
DEL (CONT'D)
Hello?
He waits... More STATIC.

It’s quiet out there.

EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY

The once-clean street is littered haphazardly with crumpled
papers, empty bottles and myriad miscellaneous trash.

On the adjacent sidewalk, Del sits cross-legged in one of the
two rocking chairs. The other remains empty.

He rocks gently back and forth. His face is sunburnt, his
lips chapped. We get the impression he’s been stationed here
for the better part of the day.

Maybe longer.

EXT. LAKE - DAY

Del splashes his face with water. The liquid revives his
cracked skin, catches in his graying beard.

He submerges the buckets one by one.

INT. GREENHOUSE - DAY

Del ambles through the rows of plants, spritzing each with
less care than usual. His gait is staggered, sleepy.

He reaches the end of his circuit. Sees Grace’s pot of soil.
The smiley-face sticker, grinning stupidly at him.

The smallest sliver of GREEN edges out from the dirt.
Del stares down at the new plant, devoid of expression.

He doesn’t move for a long time.

INT. LIBRARY - DAY
Del winds through the stacks.

He stops in the geography section. Plucks out the first road
atlas he sees. Flips through. Lands on a specific page.
80.
His eyes dart back and forth, scanning over the complex web
of routes and interstates... Fuck it. He TEARS OUT the PAGE.

It’s oddly liberating.

INT. DEL'S TRUCK - DAY

Del blows past a stop sign. Speeds through a seemingly
interminable sweep of white Xes on either side.

As he accelerates, the Xes mesh into one another, forming
twin solid white lines.

Suddenly, he BRAKES.

We're at the edge of the town. The precipice between Del’s
world and the unknown.

Del hesitates. Nearly chokes.
He grips the wheel tight. Knuckles whitening.
He wills his foot to HIT the GAS.

The engine ROARS TO LIFE. Del's truck FLIES PAST the town
limit, kicking up a layer of DUST that takes over frame.

The dust settles... The truck’s out of sight.

INT. DEL’S TRUCK - VARIOUS
C.U. on DEL through the WINDSHIELD.
His eyes are FIXED on THE ROAD. We, in turn, KEEP on HIM...

As he soars past open country and cityscapes alike, highway
and dirt road, all reflected back in the windshield’s glass.

As he swerves around abandoned cars and overturned tractor
trailers, crumbled monuments and billowing smokestacks.

As the truck battles a stretch of particularly rough terrain,
rattling and hissing in near defeat.

As day turns into night and back to day again.

As a heavy thunder ripples overhead and rain beats down on
the truck’s flimsy hood and the windshield wipers squeak
madly against the surface of the glass.

As the truck is swallowed up in thick blankets of fog, and
visibility plummets to zero. Less than zero.
81.
Del’s eyelids grow heavy. A five o’clock shadow transpires
across his face... He doesn’t waver. Keeps the wheel steady.

The truck emerges triumphant from the fog -- all of a sudden,
the windshield’s glass washes over in REFLECTIONS of LIGHT.

A city skyline, replete with glowing buildings and pulsing
neon signs and searchlights, all DANCING WILDLY ACROSS the
WINDSHIELD... We KEEP on DEL.

His pupils dilated from the onslaught of light. The corners
of his mouth twitching ever so slightly. Betraying nothing.

He pushes forward in silence.

EXT. DOWNTOWN HOUSTON - NIGHT

Del stares straight ahead. Tries to ignore the white noise of
a thousand disparate voices laughing, shouting, their figures
drifting across the windshield all at once.

A strange symphony fills our soundscape, intensifying as the
truck presses deeper into this urban sprawl... a rhythmic
cohesion of voices, pop music, TV fuzz, iPhone ringtones.

As all this BUILDS, and BUILDS, and BUILDS, Del’s fingers DIG
INTO the steering wheel... He’s LOSING IT...

The sounds RISE to an all-powerful CRESCENDO, and just as it
looks like Del’s about to BURST, we HARD CUT TO:

EXT. MERCER RANCH - DAY

A modest one-story compound on the city’s outskirts.

The early morning sun pokes out from over the mountainside,
casting the property in dark amber tones.

Del steps out from his car. Checks the address on Miles’s
business card. It’s a match with the mailbox.

He thinks. Doubles back. Grabs the GUN.

PRE-LAP: Beep. Beep. Beep.

INT. FOYER - MERCER RANCH - DAY
The low hum of electricity.

On the mantelpiece, a high-key photo of MILES and VIOLET.
82.
The image gradually MORPHS into a portrait of the whole
family. GRACE wedged uneasily between the two of them.
It’s a digital picture frame, cycling through pre-loaded
photos on a timer. A wire runs behind the mantel into a hefty
surge protector, which in turn plugs into the wall.

ANGLE on the FRONT DOOR.

Del’s shadow manifests in the adjacent window, wielding a
small screwdriver. He slips it underneath the sill...

We're familiar with this routine already. The RASP of METAL
on WOOD. Del’s GLOVED HAND reaching inside, curling TOWARD
the DOOR... TWISTING the LOCK... CLICK.

Del enters. Looks around. It’s as pleasant a house as any
other we’ve seen -- albeit pointedly more high-tech.

The room’s centerpiece: A fireplace video, crackling on MUTE.
Del removes his shoes. Sets them at the foot of the door.

He moves very slowly through the house, from the living room
into a long, narrow hallway marked by LED night lights.

The door to the first bedroom hangs slightly ajar. He sneaks
a peek inside... Two heaps slumped over in a king-sized bed,
both dormant. Violet’s head poking out from under the covers.
Del gently shuts the door.

He proceeds to the next room. Listens through the door. From
the other end, we hear the light WHIRR of MACHINERY.

His HAND rests on the KNOB. He TURNS...

INT. GRACE’S BEDROOM - MERCER RANCH - CONTINUOUS
Grace lies in bed, fast asleep.

A heart rate monitor at her side, blipping softly. An IV
drip. A tray of medical utensils. Some very sharp.

Del approaches her bedside.
DEL
(in SOTTO)

Grace.

GRACE
Mm.
83.

Grace stirs. Shifts position. Turns away from Del.

He looks CLOSER.

A small patch of hair on the left side of Grace’s head has
been SHAVED CLEAN... There’s a fresh SCAR, approximately two
inches in length, on HER SCALP.

Del TIGHTENS.

DEL
Grace. It’s me.

Her eyes flicker open. She stares straight past him.
DEL (CONT'D)
I’m gonna get you out of here.
We're gonna go home.
He plucks out her IV. Holds it to her eye line.
DEL (CONT'D)
Can you tell me what this is? Can
you tell me what they’re doing--?

GRACE
Tests.

DEL
What kinds of tests?

Grace shrugs.
DEL (CONT'D)
What’s going on? Come on. I know
you can tell me what’s going on.

GRACE
Tests.

DEL
Bad tests?

She gives him a blank stare.
DEL (CONT'D)
Okay, I’m here now. It’s time to
go. Let’s go.
He takes her hand.

She looks up at him, curious.
DEL (CONT'D)
You know me.

Grace shakes her head.

DEL (CONT'D)
Yeah you do. Don’t-- Stop that.

GRACE
Go away.

She retracts her hand.

DEL
You know who I am.
GRACE
No.
DEL

Yes. Yes you do. Because we’re
friends. Because I drove all the
way here for you... you know who I
am. I’m Del, and you’re Grace, and
you know who I am-- you know--

Her eyes are glazed over. Hollow.

DEL (CONT'D)
You know me.

She doesn’t flinch.
DEL (CONT'D)
No. Don’t do that. You know who I
am. You can’t-- please-- please
don’t do this. Say something. Come
on. Talk to me. Please... Please.
A long silence hangs between them.

Finally, Del pulls away.

GRACE
I think... they’1l die.
DEL
What?
He leans back in.
GRACE

The plants.

84.
85.

DEL
What plants? My plants?

GRACE
They’re gonna die.

DEL
It’s okay. I watered them all right
before I left. We just need to get
back in time before the next cycle.

GRACE
Really?

DEL
Yeah. They’re gonna be fine.

Grace smiles.

DEL (CONT'D)
Are you ready to go?

GRACE
I think.

She sits up. Del helps her to her feet.

INT. HALLWAY - MERCER RANCH - DAY
Grace clutches Del’s arm for support.

They push past the door to the master bedroom. Grace’s gaze
strays over her shoulder.

DEL
We have to keep moving. They could
wake up any second--

The FLUSH of a TOILET. A protracted YAWN. From the opposite
end of the hallway. In their direct path.

Del and Grace stop dead in their tracks.

The bathroom door CREAKS OPEN... Grace grabs Del TIGHT... Out
steps MILES, sleepy-eyed and scratching at his boxers.

He takes a beat to register the two of them.

MILES
We've got a doorbell, you know.

He doesn’t stop scratching.
86.

MILES (CONT'D)
Gracie, you’re supposed to be in
bed. Del, how’s about the two of us
take a walk outside--?

DEL
We're leaving.

MILES
Leaving? But you just got here!

He looks from Del to Grace.

Del WHIPS

MILES (CONT'D)
Oh. I see what’s going on.

DEL
What did you do to her?

MILES
She’s in the middle of an extensive
treatment. I’1l just put her back
to bed and afterwards I can tell
you all about it--

OUT his HANDGUN.

MILES (CONT'D)
Whoa there. You even know how to
use that thing?

DEL
I’m not gonna ask again.

MILES
I mean, I’m happy to discuss it. I
tried to broach the subject with
you last time we met, but you
didn’t seem all that interested.
Honestly, I think you of all people
will really appreciate this.

Del lowers the gun.

DEL
What are you talking about?

MILES
How familiar are you with the field
of psychosurgery? Not the Ken Kesey
stuff, I’m talking about genuine
impulse correction. Realignment.
We’re using the power of science to
make unhappy people happier.
87.

DEL
I don’t understand.

MILES
We've got a team of doctors here in
Houston, the best minds on the
planet. They’ve come a long way
toward unlocking the complexities
of the human brain.

Grace reaches for the scar on her head.

MILES (CONT'D)
It’s nothing to be afraid of. Very
much the opposite. We’re developing
a means by which to control for all
types of disorders. Schizophrenia.
Depression. Suicidal thoughts.

He takes a step forward.

MILES (CONT'D)
Picture a world where those nasty
elements simply don’t exist. Where
disorder’s translated into order.
Where every human mind’s free from
pain. Free from angst and sadness
and-- and all-around chaos. It’d
be, well, you could say it’s--

DEL
Perfect.

MILES

Exactly. It’s practically a return
to Eden. I’m glad you came here,
Del. That you’re able to see it all
firsthand. I'd like to have you
involved as we move forward. I
think together we can accomplish
some really wonderful stuff--

DEL
No.

MILES
What?

DEL

No. We're going. Excuse us.

MILES
You're just gonna leave?
88.

Miles blocks their path.

MILES (CONT'D)
Now see, I’ve got a problem with
that. A man doesn’t just go and
break into another man’s home,
steal away his daughter and expect
no pushback on the matter. No way.
I’m gonna fuckin’ fight you on that
one, Del. And I’m gonna win too.

He peers over at Grace.
MILES (CONT'D)
Sweetie, why don’t you head on back
to bed? You know you’ve got another
round of treatment in the morning--

Grace SNATCHES the GUN from DEL’S BELT in ONE SWIFT MOTION.
Before EITHER MAN can REACT -- BLAM!

Miles’s HEAD EXPLODES in a MESS of BLOOD and BRAINS.

Grace straightens her posture. She and Del both stares down
at the corpse, neither showing any visible reaction.

The door behind them opens. They turn to see VIOLET, clad in
her pajamas. Rubbing her eyes. Exhausted.

She gazes past them at Miles’s body.

VIOLET
Oh, honey.

GRACE
Where’s my photo?

VIOLET
Which photo?

GRACE
The one you took from me.

Violet looks up at Grace.
VIOLET
That photo’s long gone.
EXT. MERCER RANCH - DAY

BLAM. BLAM.
89.

INT. FOYER - MERCER RANCH - DAY

Del hastens to the front door, leaving behind a trail of
blood-soaked shoe prints.

DEL
Are you coming?

Grace remains in the hallway, the gun limp at her side.

She turns

DEL (CONT'D)
Grace--?

GRACE
We have to get rid of them.

to Del.

GRACE (CONT'D)
When they find the bodies, they’1l
open an investigation. They know
who I am. They’1ll come after us.

DEL
Who will?

GRACE
Do you really want to know?

Del considers this.

GRACE (CONT'D)
We have a few hours before anyone
else shows up. We need to make it
look like they left town.

DEL
Okay.

GRACE
There should be trash bags and
cleaning supplies in the garage.
They might have some extra paint
back there too.

DEL
Where’s that?

Grace points. Del heads for the door.

GRACE
Hey Del? I’m sorry I shot them.

Del stops. He looks back at her.
90.
DEL
No you're not.

GRACE
Is that okay?

DEL
I think so. Yeah.
INT. VARIOUS - MERCER RANCH - DAY
Del yanks out the shower curtain.

He and Grace slide Violet’s body onto the plastic. Her head
is covered with a SKI MASK drenched in BLOOD.

They roll her into a tight cocoon. Secure it in place with
one, two, three layers of packing tape.

They fold Miles’s body into a bearskin rug. His head, or lack
thereof, also MASKED.

Grace sprays the floor with a cleaning solution. Sops up the
bloody footprints with a fat sponge.

Del picks at the flecks of brain matter in the wall with a
pair of tweezers. Deposits them in a trash bag.

Grace dances around him, erasing any and all traces of blood
with a fresh coat of white paint.

Del peruses Miles’s library. Picks out a book he doesn’t
recognize. Reads the dust jacket. Tosses it in his backpack.

Grace powers down the medical equipment. Changes the sheets
on her bed. Smooths out the creases in the fabric.

Del heaves two bulging trash bags into the back of his truck.
Miles and Violet’s burritoed bodies are already buckled in.

Grace jerks the plug from the digital picture frame. Mi and
Vi's smiling faces ZAP to BLACK.

Del activates the kitchen faucet. Marvels at the sight of
running water. Cranes his head downward... Lets the liquid
flow freely over his face. Drinks.

EXT. MERCER RANCH - DAY

Del exits the house. He sees Grace in the front yard, the
paint bin at her side.
gl.

He walks over to her. She holds out a damp brush.

Del thinks. He takes the brush from Grace. Kneels into the
dirt. Paints a long, thick STRIP of WHITE. Then ANOTHER.

He pulls back, revealing an X.

DEL
Ready?

GRACE
Almost.
INT. KITCHEN - MERCER RANCH - DAY
Grace beelines to the freezer. Flings the drawer open.
From FREEZER POV, we look up at Grace’s face, awash in a soft
orange light. She smiles wide.
INT. DEL’S TRUCK - DAY

Del and Grace hit the road. The city skyline fades to
nothingness in the back windshield.

Grace cradles a mammoth bucket of Neapolitan ice cream in her
lap. Devouring it by the spoonful.

She offers Del a scoop. He pulls his head away from her.

DEL
You’re gonna use the same spoon?

Grace's smile fades.

GRACE
You must be joking.

He keeps his eyes on the road. Doesn’t respond.
GRACE (CONT'D)
You are joking, right? Please tell
me you’re... Del?
Del peers over at her.

He cracks a smile.

GRACE (CONT'D)
You asshole.

ROLL CREDITS.
