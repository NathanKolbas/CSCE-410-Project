INT. HILLTOP - NOON

One might describe the scene as beautiful, if one could get by the child’s

~ coffin.

A wooden sign in the dirt reads.

“Here lies Danie] Nicholson.
Beloved by all.
Died October 3, 1897”

A wilting man in his late forties sits on the grass next to the, much too small
box. :

MAN(smiling)
Who will plague me with
questions now?... Who will
pinch me to wake me up? Who
will Jaugh at me when I fall?
(voice cracks)
Who’s breath will I'listen to so
that ] may sleep? Who’s hand
will I hold, so that I may walk?

The wilting man’s face trembles.

Behind him, a respectful thirty feet away, stand a group of about sixty
people, equally still.

CUT TO:
EXT. SUPPER TABLE ~ AFTERNOON

An enormous handmade wooden table sits in the center of a small village of
log cabins. All sixty members of the village are seated for the meal.

The women wear bonnets. The men have their farmer’s shirts rolled up at
the sleeves.

 
pe po!

Aman in his late forties stands. He has the eyes of a child; innocent and

“pure. This is EDWARD WALKER.

WALKER
We came here to start anew-

_ Beat. Eyes look up one by one. Edward Walker stands silently, appearing
suddenly overwhelmed. A hand reaches up and squeezes his arm. Edward
Walker looks down to the wilting man we saw earlier. They look at each
other quietly.

‘Walker turns back to the table.
WALKER
We came here to start anew.
We are grateful for the time we
have been given.

Walker sits. Movement begins across the table as hands begin to pass bread
& and corn and meat

AND THEN WE HEAR IT. THE SOUND CARRIES THROUGH THE

AIR AND BLEEDS INTO THE VILLAGE. IT COMES FROM THE

WOODS.

SCREAMS. IT IS NOT HUMAN.

All movement at the table stops, except for a TALL BOY at the end of the

table. He is barely in his twenties. He is mentally handicapped. He starts

clapping wildly.

Everyone else sits uncomfortably still. No expressions on their faces. They
wait.

“THEN THE SCREAMS SLOWLY START TO MOVE AWAY.

The boy’s clapping slows and then stops as well. The happiness trickles
from his face.

 
 

 

The rest of the table waits till the last of the nonhuman screams have moved
_ away. And then quietly hands start reaching across the table again.

CUT TO:
EXT. WATER PUMP —- LATE AFTERNOON

A group of women.and girls are washing and drying the wooden bowls and
plates at a hand water pump that stands in the ground.

A strong older woman pumps the handle. Bursts of water spurt out from the

pump’s mouth. Two girls are holding bowls under the water. One girl gets
splashed by the other. They both start laughing. The older woman makes a
disapproving noise with her mouth. The girls looks over, nod and return to

washing the bowls; little grins on their little faces.

CUT TO:
EXT. PORCH — LATE AFTERNOON

Two young women sweep the porch of a cabin. One of the young women”
starts mimicking the other’s movements. They begin to sweep in synch.
They both begin to smile as they sweep. They begin to move around the
porch like dancers.

They’re giggling stops as one spots something. They both stop dancing.
They look down at the base of the post that holds the porch roof up. There
are two RED WILDFLOWERS peeking out from the fist full of weeds.

They bend down quickly and yank the red wildflowers out. They move off
the porch and kneel down in the dirt next to the porch.

They use their hands to dig a small hole in the dirt. They put the crushed red
wildflowers into the hole and methodically bury it.

The two young women stand, Jook around, and wipe themselves off before
returning to the porch and picking up the brooms again.

EXT. COURTYARD BELL - LATE AFTERNOON
A MEDIUM SIZED BRASS BELL hangs from a wooden t-post. A hand
reaches out and takes hold of the rope that dangles from its side. The hand
pulls once strong and hard.

CUT TO:
EXT. STORAGE CABIN — LATE AFTERNOON

Men stow away farm equipment. Hoes and sickles are stacked neatly in
piles.

ALONG BELL TOLLS.

The men stop working. They put down their tools where they stand. One
man Jeans into the storage cabin to tell those inside.

MAN
Drill bell.

CUT TO:
EXT. WATER PUMP —- LATE AFTERNOON

The older women usher the girls into an orderly Jine as they leave the area of
the water pump. Dirty dishes are left on the ground.

CUT TO:
EXT. CLUSTER OF CABINS - LATE AFTERNOON ©
We see the courtyard. There are clusters of cabins on every side.
We watch as one by one everyone in the courtyard and everyone coming in
from the fields, disappears into different cabins like ants retreating into ant

holes.

INT. CABIN — LATE AFTERNOON
We are in someone’s home. A group of about eight women and children
walk in through the front door. They move to the back of the small cabin
where a woman reaches down and pulls on a handle in the floor.

. . . LUT TO: |
INT. DIFFERENT CABIN — LATE AFTERNOON

We are in another-two-room cabin. A group of men wait their turn as each
man climbs into the trap door in the floor.

When the last is in. The final man reaches up and brings down the trap door,
closing them all in.

CUT TO:
INT. UNDERGROUND ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON
A collection of two men, four women and three children are huddled
together i in a four by eight space in the ground. The adults have to sit down
to fit in this space.
A THIN STRIP OF LIGHT FALLS ON THE FACES from the seam in the
trap door. All we hear is the nine of them breathing. Their eyes all stare at
the CRACK OF LIGHT.
A child coughs. A woman reaches over a couple bodies and pats the
coughing child on his back. The child settles. They all return to staring at the
light. Beat.
THE BRASS BELL SOUNDS AGAIN.
The two men reach up and open the trap door. LIGHT POURS IN.
One by one, they all climb out of the four by eight space in the ground.

INT. FAMILY CABIN - LATE AFTERNOON

The men, women and three children walk out into the afternoon light. One
woman immediately grabs a broom and continues cleaning the porch.

The community returns to doing their chores.

CUT TO:
EXT. CABIN —- NIGHT
We are in the darkness, Jooking into the LIGHT OF A CABIN WINDOW.
We see a child’s bedroom - A small bed - A small wooden desk. On the
child’s desk there is nothing.
The wilting man lays curled up on the little bed. He stares out with red eyes.

CUT TO:
EXT. CABIN — NIGHT
In another cabin we see a woman pouring water from a jug into a large white
bowl by the side of the bed. We see her speak to her husband who sits
reading in bed. She Jeans over and begins washing her face with the water in
the bowl.

CUT TO:
EXT. CABIN — NIGHT

Three children kneel and pray by their bedside. Their parents begin blowing
out the oil lamps in their room.

CUT TO:
EXT. TOWER — NIGHT
A young man blows his nose into a handkerchief. He wipes his face and

resumes standing. His eyes gaze down quietly. The ORANGE LIGHT
FROM THE TORCH LIT NEXT TO HIM, FLICKERS ON HIS FACE.
 

 

 

 

He is standing on a platform, thirty feet in the air. It is a tower on the edge of
this community. He is keeping guard.

Arms folded, he stares at the darkened woods.
. CUT TO:
EXT. SCHOOL HOUSE — MORNING

A group of children carrying cloth bags with books in them, crowd around
something in the dirt.

Edward Walker moves through the tiny gathering.

WALKER
What manner of spectacle has
caught your attention so
splendidly? I ought to carry it
in my pocket to help me teach.

Edward Walker parts the final layer of titillated children. He stares down at
the thing on the ground. Beat. His expression becomes grave.

WALKER
Who came upon this?

Jt takes a moment before a little boy steps forward. His eyes never look up.

WALKER
Philip, did you move this?

PHILIP shakes his head, “No.” Everyone watches Walker who turns and
looks down again quietly.

ITIS HARD FOR US TO SEE THROUH ALL THE TINY LEGS AND
FEET OF THE CHILDREN. THERE IS SOMETHING DARK AND
MOIST LYING IN THE DIRT.

CUT TO:
 

INT. CLASSROOM - MORNING

 

The classroom is overcome by whispering. Walker uses chalk to write the
date, “October 5, 1897” on a gray slate board framed in wood.

He turns to the children who range in age from seven to twelve.

WALKER
Okay, let’s have it. What
delicious conclusions have you
come to?

THIN BOY
An animal God created was
slain.

WALKER
Donald, please, try to speak
plainly. It disturbs your mother,
when you speak so darkly.
Everything need not be said
with such drama.

 

Another hand shoots up.
WALKER
Marybeth.
MARYBETH

] inspected it carefully. Its head
was twisted back and much of
its fur was removed.

WALKER
I see.

DONALD

‘s Jt was murdered.
 

Now the children become quiet.

 

WALKER
So who is the culprit? Who has
done this heinous act?

Beat.

MARY |
Those we don’t speak of, killed
it.

WALKER
And there it is.
coe ee eee (beat)
Why would such a notion enter
your heads? |

TWELVE-YEAR OLD BOY
Those we don’t speak of, eat
smaller animals.

 

BROWN EYED GIRL
Those we don’t speak of have
claws.

WALKER

Children... Those we don’t
speak of have not breached our
border for many years. We do
not go into their woods and
they do not come into our
valley. We do not threaten
them. Why would they do this?

DONALD
It is a warning of the doom to
come.

WALKER
(stern)
Donald.

Walker gazes out at the classroom of concerned children,

WALKER
Is it possible, in your haste, you
have missed the simplest
explanation? That this small
animal was slain by a slightly
larger animal like a fox, and
that this said fox carried it into
our village.to avoid other
scavengers from coming and
eating his prize. And when our
village awoke and started its
morning business, the fox was
scared off and left its prize for
us to find.

(beat)
I can’t say if that’s what really
happened, but it’s certainly
more reasonable to think that,
than something...
unprecedented.

MARY
I did see two foxes on the hill
yesterday.

WALKER
Does anyone have further
questions pertaining to our
immediate doom?

Walker winks at Donald. No one raises their hand. ‘

 

Walker watches the image of the foxes scamper through the minds of the

 
 

 

WALKER
Then if it is agreeable, let us
begin our studies.

One by one, the children reach into their cloth bags and retrieve their
notebooks. oe

CUT TO:

INT: MEETING HALL - AFTERNOON

We are'in one of the largest cabins. Wooden chairs are scattered throughout.
This is some sort of gathering place.

Twelve of the chairs have been brought together in a circle. Twelve of the
oldest members of the village are seated in the chairs.

The Wilting man and Edward Walker are among them.

FIDGETY WOMAN
We ought not to overlook the
Flight of the Birds. We didn’t
have it last year and I for one
missed it desperately. I know
Tabitha missed the children
dressed in feathers and such.

A small, gentle woman with her hair tied back, looks up. TABITHA sits to
Edward Walker’s side.

TABITHA
lam fond of it.

The two women slowly turn to Edward.

EDWARD
I do not have a say in this
matter. August Nicholson is
Chair of today’s meeting.
 

 

 

All eyes tum to the wilting man, AUGUST NICHOLSON. He appears
exhausted. August nods as he shuffles the papers in his hand.

AUGUST
The Flight of the Birds will be
returned to this year’s Fall
Festival.

The group.nods quietly.

FIDGETY WOMAN
Let us speak of food then.

THERE JS A KNOCK at the far end of the room. All attention moves in that

direction.

Another man in his mid forties steps in. He carries a tiny smile, his eyebrows
are raised.

MAN
There is a young man who has
requested a word with the
elders.

The group looks to one another. This is unusual.

AUGUST
Do have him come forward.

The man with the raised eyebrows steps out. Beat. The door stays still fora
moment, and then it opens.

A sinewy young man in his twenties steps in. His deep-set brow and dark
green eyes never look up as he walks forward to the group.

There are many glances to a pretty elder in her forties. Edward looks to her
as well. She stares back with the identical dark green eyes as the boy. She
shakes her head slightly; She doesn’t know why he’s here.
 

The young man slows to a stop a few feet from them. His hand brings a
paper up. He begins to read carefully.

GREEN EYES
My mother is unaware of the
reason for my visit today. She
did not give her consent or
consult me in any form.

The woman with green eyes moves forward in her seat without knowing it.

GREEN EYES

_T have spent all but my first

years in this village. It is all that
1 know. It is a blessed place,
this village. Our days are filled
with love and compassion and

joy.

His green eyes flick up, just for a moment... He returns to the paper.

GREEN EYES
But there is also some suffering
and fear. The passing of little
Daniel Nicholson from illness-

August Nicholson goes still.

GREEN EYES
-and other events have
weighted on my thoughts. We
have been taught of the greed
and corruption that exists in the
towns. And the countless
wasted lives centered on the
exchange of money there. But
we have also been taught about
their fascination with science
and machines and medicine.
 

 

)

GREEN EYES
Could they have rescued Daniel
from his terrible illness?

(beat)
I ask permission to cross into
the forbidden woods and travel
to the nearest town. I will
gather new medicines and
information of what has
happened in the world, and I
will return.

Beat.

Lee a _. ... GREEN EYES -- 2=-=-:
With regards to Those we don’t
speak of, I am but a single
person, J am not a threat to
them, I am certain they will let
me pass.

(Beat)
Creatures can sense emotion _
and fear. They will see ] am
pure of intention and not afraid.
The end.

The young man with green eyes lowers his hands with the paper and stares
at the group.

No one moves at first. Edward Walker begins to smile.
WALKER
(soft)
Lucius Hunt, that is the most

I’ve heard you speak in many
years combined.

The young man with green eyes stands quietly before the group.

_INT. CABIN - NIGHT

The pretty woman with green eyes sits on the edge of her bed in her night
robe. She hears her son descend the ladder from the loft space he lives in.

ALICE HUNT watches him through her bedroom doorway.

/ ALICE
What goes on in that head of
. yours?
LUCIUS turns to face her.
ALICE

Say something Lucius.
Beat. Lucius stares.

LUCIUS .

(soft)
Finton Coin is in the Tower. I
promised to sit with him.

Alice lies back in her bed. She pulls the covers over herself. She gazes at her
son from the pillow.

ALICE
Why do you not tell me what
you feel? I do not know if you
think about love. I do not know
what your dreams are. When
you stood today, you spoke in
such a gentlemanly manner. I
scarcely recognized you.

Her eyes close.
 

 

 

ALICE
How can a mother fail to
recognize her son? Tell me.
Tell me that...

Lucius watches his mother become quiet. Her breathing becomes steady and
soft.

Lucius walks into her room and takes the quilt from the rocking chair and
gently places it over his mother’s sleeping shoulders. He whispers in her ear.

LUCIUS
Ido think about love.

Lucius walks out of his mother’s room and exits the cabin quietly.

CUT TO:
EXT. TOWER — NIGHT

FINTON COIN is a skinny boy with big curly hair. He is on the platform —
tonight, thirty feet in the air. .

The trap door opens as Lucius climbs up. Finton immediately relaxes.

FINTON
Did anyone see your approach?

Lucius shakes his head, “No.”

FINTON

I saw Christop Crane sniffing
around. He suspects something.
He has announced, more than
once, in my presence that only
one man should hold post in the
tower each night. Why would
he say such a thing if he didn’t
suspect? What a wretch he is?
Is it so bad to be a trifle timid?
 

FINTON
Are you sure you were not ©
detected?

Lucius shakes his head again, “No” as he takes his seat in the corner. Beat.

FINTON
And I shared a portion of my
chicken with him not two days
ago. A fine, tender piece.

The two young men fall into silence; one sitting, one standing. And then out
of the silence- . :

LUCTUS
Do you ever think of the towns
Finton?

Finton turns to the sound of Lucius’ voice,
FINTON
The towns? What for? They’re
wicked places where wicked

people live, that’s all.

Finton doesn’t notice the expression on Lucius’ face as he sits in the
shadows. Finton shrugs his shoulders and returns to looking out. Beat.

FINTON
(soft)
I do hope no one saw you.

EXT. APPLE ORCHARD - DAY

Along the hilltop runs a group of twenty apple trees; their branches bursting
with deep red pickings.
On the ground near the trees are baskets filled with apples. A few are
toppled over.

 

Standing in a tight group a few feet from the abandoned baskets are a group
of women. The same quiet fearful expressions on their faces.

They stare at something at the base of a tree. We can’t see what it is, but we
can HEAR THE FLIES BUZZING around its dead carcass.

Alice Hunt’s green eyes look compassionately over the gathering.

ALICE
What we seem to have amongst
us, is a scavenger of some type.
Most likely a coyote or wolf.
It’s manner of killing and
removing the fur, but leaving
the flesh torn may be a sign that
the animal may suffer from _
madness.

An uncomfortable murmur flutters in the meeting room.

 
 

ALICE /
For the next fortnight we
should be vigilant for sightings
of this coyote. Keep careful
watch over the little ones as
they play on the hills.

. As for the other notion... we do
not believe our boundary has
been breached: Those We
Don’t Speak Of are much larger
creatures than coyotes. We
.would know if they had been
here.

CUT TO:
EXT. COURTYARD — AFTERNOON

We pick up Edward Walker as he leaves the meeting hall with the rest of the
congregation. A young woman in her early twenties catches up to him. She
has a round attractive face. She is the lively sort. She practically bounces to
his side.

GIRL
It’s frightful, this business with
the coyote, is it not Pappa?

WALKER
Do not fee] worried Kitty?

KITTY
You are not troubled?

“WALKER
Tam certain it will all end soon.

KITTY
Can we speak on other matters
then?

WALKER
It would be a relief.

KITTY WALKER takes his arm and whispers in his ear as they walk.

KITTY
Jam in love.

He looks at his daughter as they tum the comer onto a path where they are
alone. Kitty beams at his side.

WALKER
Ihave great reverence for the
word ‘Jove’ Kitty. It should not
be thrown about lightly. It is
the greatest force on this earth.

KITTY
These feelings are so strong, it
can be nothing else Pappa.

WALKER

I see.
KITTY

You do not believe me.
WALKER

I] have no judgment yet.
KITTY

It must have been bubbling

inside me for a long time, for it
came bursting forth not three
days ago. J have thought of
nothing since.

Edward nods his head.
 

 

 

21

WALKER
‘Burting forth’ is it?
KITTY
I realized since I’m the eldest

‘of your children and since you

were stricken with five girls
and no boys, I decided to act as
if ] were the son and ask your
permission.

WALKER

- I must correct you on the word

‘stricken’. I would not trade
any one of my five daughters
for a hundred of the finest boys.
So now, what is it you are
asking permission for?

_ KITTY
I would like permission to
marry, Pappa.

WALKER
There is.a proper manner in
which these things are to
happen. Such as the boy would
normally be standing next to
you at a moment such as this.
Where is the boy in all of this

Kitty? |

KITTY -
J haven’t spoken to him as of
yet.

Now Edward stops walking.

 
 

WALKER
The young man is unaware of
your intentions? .

KITTY .
He has a quiet way. I was going
to talk with him, but ] wanted

with him without your
blessings. :

Edward starts walking again.

Kitty sees the expression on her father’s face.

KITTY
You think badly of him?

No, no... I’ve just been
thinking on him recently.

KITTY

He’s not like the other boys. He
doesn’t joke and bounce about.

KITTY :
Do I have your blessings then?

He looks down at his eldest daughter. He nods, “yes.”

She hugs him tight as they come to a stop in the far end of the courtyard at
the base of the medium sized town bell.

WALKER
Do me one favor first Kitty. Do
_ hot tell anyone else of your
‘burstings’ until you have
spoken with the young man.

Kitty nods earnestly. Beat. Edward Walker gets lost in his thoughts again.
KITTY
(whispers)
Papa, something does trouble
you? / |

Edward looks down and sees the concern in his daughter’s eyes.

Beat. He then reaches up and pulls long and hard on the rope that tolls the
brass bell.

We see in the background everyone stops what they’re doing and begins
walking in lines towards the cabins.

We watch as people walk in from the stream and from the orchards. They
disappear quietly into the cabins.

Lucius’ hands stop their work. He turns and looks over his shoulder at the
young woman that stands before him. She rises on her tip-toes and returns to
earth again. Lucius never lets go of his tools. He nods hello to her.

KITTY
I wanted to tell you something. . |

Lucius stares.

KITTY
My goodness, my heart is
pounding so fast, I think I may -
faint right on this spot... You’d

Lucius continues to stare.

KITTY
Seeing as you’re of age... and
seeing as I’m of age... and .
seeing as we get along so well
like this... A thought entered
my head that may have entered
your head as well.

Lucius blinks his green eyes. Kitty takes this .as a positive gesture and smiles
sweetly.

KITTY

(soft)
J love you Lucius. I love you
like the day is long. I love you
more than the sun and moon
together. And if you feel the
same way, we.should not hide

wv it any longer. It’s a gift, love is.

Kitty i is wailing.

Edward carries his youngest daughter in his arms as his petite wife holds
their next two youngest on their Japs. They watch with concern as Kitty cries
loudly from her bedroom

Kitty is being consoled by her closest sister. Kitty has her head in her sister’s
lap.

IVY WALKER strokes the hair of her older sister gently. Ivy is thin, almost
too thin. Her long blond hair falls over her sharp striking face.

She wipes the tears from her sister’s cheeks. Beat. Ivy begins to sing sofily.

Lucius knocks on the half open door with his elbow. He waits a moment and

pushes the door open. Lucius carries a large pile of firewood in his arms as
he steps into the cabin.

, He sees the wilting man, August Nicholson, sleeping in a chair.

Lucius moves to the hearth. Some of the kindling falls off the pile onto the
floor. August stirs awake. He sees Lucius kneeling with the wood.

AUGUST
You are very kind.

Lucius nods.
AUGUST
You must pardon my manners.
Thaven’t slept in many nights.

Lucius nods again and starts making a pile next to the hearth. Beat.

August doesn’t reply. He is fast asleep in the chair.

Lucius retums to the pile. He transfers the last of the firewood from his
arms.

AUGUST(0.s.)
-you may run from sorrow. As
we have. Sorrow will find you.

‘Lucius turns to see August, eyes open this time, staring into the corner of the
cabin. :

It can smell you.

Lucius follows the elder’s gaze to the corrier of the room where a WOODEN
BLACK BOX, one foot by one foot, sits on a'table all by itself.

Lucius turns back to August.

There were pasteries with
cream in them.
Lucius watches as August Nicholson’s eyes slowly close again. Beat.
Lucius rises to his feet. He walks across the cabin to the door.

EXT. BORDER — NIGHT

We are at the edge of the village. Yellow cloth flags are attached to the trees
that create the natural border between the grassy slopes and the woods. The
yellow flags and torch lit lamp curve into the distance as far as one can see.

A fifteen-year old boy in overalls stands on a stump-right at the edge of the
grass. His back is to the woods. His arms outstretched at his sides. His body
makes the form of the crucifix. He is trembling.

YOUNG MAN(o.s.)
He has tears in his eyes,
Christop.

A group of young men are huddled behind a rock ten feet down the slope
and watch the fifteen-year old standing on the stump.

CHRISTOP.CRANE is a thin, tall, very neatly combed young man.
CHRISTOP
He’s doing capitol. Just a few

more moments...

The young men fight each other for the best view.

his arms. .

-WE ARE IN THE DARKNESS OF THE WOODS. WE ARE BEHIND

THE BOY. WE SEE THE SILOHUETTE OF HIS SLIGHT FIGURE
STANDING ON THE TREE STUMP.

The boy makes a noise — a a slight whimper. A NOISE IS HEARD FROM
THE WOODS.

The boy stiffens. He whispers out to the boys behind the rock.

BOY ON STUMP

They made a sound when I
made a sound. They mimic
before they attack.

Christop pops his head out.
CHRISTOP

That’s a wives tale. It isn’t true.

Do not falter... A few moments
more.

A BRANCH SNAPS IN THE WOODS. The fifteen-year old’s eyes flick up.
All the heads from behind the rock peek out.

The boy LISTENS desperately. He wants to look behind, but he doesn’t.

THERE ARE NOISES IN THE WOODS. THE SOUND OF LEAVES
BEING CRUNCHED.

The boy begins to shake.
 

 

A LARGE BRANCH SNAPS. The fifteen-year old lets out a SMALL
SQUEAL as he lowers his arms and jumps from the stump. He starts
running. .

He runs past the young men hiding behind the rock. As he does; they start
running too. Everyone evacuates in a hurry. They all start racing down the
slope back to the FIRE LIGHTS FLICKERING in the distance from the
village.

CUT TO:
INT. VILLAGE COURYARD — NIGHT
The gang of young men, are moving at a fast walk through the courtyard,
trying to catch their breath. The fifteen-year old walks in the center receiving
various pats on the back. His face is still ashen.
The group walks by a contemplative Lucius.

He doesn’t look up as they pass in a flurry of youthful conversation.

Lucius moves silently in the opposite direction, the weight on his shoulders,
almost visible.

CUT TO:
EXT. SCHOOLYARD FIELD - DAY

The mentally handicapped young man we saw clapping at the supper table is

’ wrestling in the dirt with two young men who try to restrain him.

He is strong and quick. The two young men end up in the dirt over and over
as the mentally handicapped young man slips them and throws them down.

The children watch the dust and dirt kick up as the three continue scuffling.

EXT. SCHOOLHOUSE - DAY

A trail of dark blood runs down the forehead of a hysterical child. Kitty

gently escorts him off the playground.

They pass Ivy seated on.a bench that overlooks the back of the schoolyard.

‘Kitty speaks over her shoulder as she climbs the steps into the school

building.
KITTY.
Noah ought to be punished. He

wacked little Joseph with a
stick again.

Ivy nods. Kitty and JOSEPH disappear into the school building..
Ivy takes hold of the wooden cane lying next to her. She rises from the
bench. She moves towards the NOISE OF THE PLAYGROUND: The
wooden cane moves deftly back and forth in front of her.
Her STRIKING BLIND EYES focus on nothing.

CUT TO:
EXT. SCHOOLYARD — DAY

The wrestling has gotten fierce. NOAH PERCY is almost pinned when he
suddenly throws them and frees himself. The two young men immediately
go for his legs.

IVY

Noah Percy, stop your fussing
right this moment.

Noah stops and stares at Ivy.

The two young men on the ground stop. They realize they are holding each
other’s leg.

Noah stands as the two young men lie on the ground. Noah smiles sweetly
at Ivy.

CUT TO:
EXT. QUIET ROOM —- DAY

A heavy Jock is undone. The tall wooden door swings open. We look into a-
smal] cabin. It has only one room. It has a wooden chair in the center. A few
potato sacks have been piled in the comer. The room is dusty.

Ivy and Noah stand and look in. Noah holds her arm.

Ivy
You’re in trouble you know?

NOAH
No hitting.

IVY
I’m to place you in the quiet
room.

NOAH
-I’'ll cry quarts.

IVY
What if we strike a deal?

* NOAH
Capitol! Capitol idea!

IVY
It would be prudent to keep our
deal a secret. Can you do that?

NOAH
Like a church mouse.

This makes Ivy laugh. Noah laughs too.

room if you take an oath to :
never strike any person again.

Ivy puts out her hand to shake.

IVY
_No hitting.

Noah shakes hands, up and down big, like the elders do.

Ivy taps her cheek. Noah leans down, for he stands a good six inches taller
than her, and kisses her softly once.

IVY
The deal is struck.

Noah is beaming. Ivy closes the door to the quiet room.

Ivy
We ought not return right away.
What shall we do with our
stolen time?

(beat)
Shall we have a foot race? Up
the hill to the resting rock.

NOAH
No cheating.

IVY
What a deeply scandalous thing
to say. I insist you take that
back... Is that the school bell?

Noah looks back. Ivy takes off. She’s a good ten feet down the path before
he turns to see her not there.

CUT TO:
EXT. RESTING ROCK - DAY

Noah is bigger, stronger and faster, but he.has a hard time. catching the blind
young woman running ahead of him. She moves effortlessly. She does not
use her stick. She knows every step of these hills. She taps a tree as she runs
by. She is laughing as she runs. :

Noah passes her just as they finish. They both are out of breath as they reach
the rock formation.

One rock juts out at the base of an enormous wall of rock buried into the
side of the hill. There is shade here. This is Resting Rock.

There is someone sitting there when they arrive. Noah goes right over and
sits with him. Ivy sits and catches her breath before looking in their
direction. - .

IVY
My sister cried a lot.

Lucius stops eating the biscuit he has wrapped in his handkerchief for his
lunch break. Beat.

Ivy
Do you wonder how I
recognized you.

Lucius stares at the striking girl with the sweaty face and messed hair.

IVY
Some people, just a handful
mind you, give off the tiniest
color. It’s faint, like a haze. It’s
the only thing I ever see in the
darkness. Papa has it too.

Lucius gazes quietly at Ivy as if she was a sorcerer. Noah just smiles. Beat.

IVY
Do you wonder what your color
is? Well that, I won’t tell you.
It’s not ladylike to speak of
such things. You shouldn’t
even have asked.

Lucius fights a smile. Noah runs off after some nearby birds.

Ivy smoothes her wrinkled, dusty frock. It is an uncharacteristic nervous
gesture.
IVY
(serious)
I know why you denied my
sister.

Lucius’ smile melts away.

IVY
When I was younger you used
to hold my arm when I walked.
Then suddenly you stopped.
(beat)
One day, I even tripped in your
presence and nearly fell. I was
faking of course, but still you
did not hold me.

Ivy
Sometimes we don’t do things
‘we want to do, so that others
won’t know we want to do
them.

Lucius is about to say something when Noah comes back. Noah sits down
between them. Lucius turns his piercing eyes back to his biscuit.

 
 

 

 

36

Noah reaches into his pocket. He clutches something in his hand. He puts it
into Ivy’s lap.

IVY
What’s this?
She feels it in her hands.
IVY

A flower, what a splendid
present.

Lucius glances over. He goes still. Beat.

LUCIUS

Be cautious. You are holding
the bad color. :

Ivy’s face changes as she holds the RED FLOWER.

IVY

(even)
Noah it is not allowed. This
color attracts Those We Don’t
Speak of. You must bury it.

She holds it out to a saddened Noah. Her hand is trembling slightly. He
takes it back after a moment.

IvY
You ought not to pick that color
flower anymore.

Lucius gazes at the flower in Noah’s hand.

LUCIUS
He did not pick that now.
 

 

Beat. Ivy’s head turns a quarter turn towards Lucius.

IVY
What’s wrong? You’re
breathing has changed.

LUCIUS
I’ve never set eyes on such a
flower.

Lucius and Noah look at each other. Beat.
LUCIUS
(quiet)
Noah... where did you find
this?
CUT TO:
EXT. BORDER — AFTERNOON

Ivy’s fingers trace along Noah’s arm. She finds his hand. She moves over his
finger that is pointing: She turns and faces that direction.

Beat.
IVY
Are you sure? _
Noah nods.
NOAH
No cheating.

Ivy, Noah, and Lucius stand at the top of the hill and stare. Beat. Lucius
turns and starts walking down the hill.

Alice watches her son lower the paper at his side. He just stands there. Beat.

Lucius eyes drift down. He tilts the paper slightly as he tries to read the
words at a steep angle at his side.

LUCIUS

Edward smiles.

Lucius brings the paper back up.

Today at Resting Rock. Noah
Percy handed Ivy Walkera _
flower of the bad color.

 

Edward Walker sits up just a bit at the sound of his daughter’s name.

LUCIUS
When asked where he found
this flower, for it was not like
others I have seen, he took us
there. He led us to the peak of
the hill, by the tree stump.
There he pointed to a bush
covered in flowers of the bad
color.

y Lucius looks up. He doesn’t look down when he says the next six words.

LUCIUS
He was pointing into Covington
Woods.

Lucius returns his eyes to the paper.

LUCIUS
By my eye, the bush of the bad
color was, at the very least,
seventy-five paces past the
forbidden line.

Beat.
LUCTUS
It is my belief that Noah Percy
has entered the woods, and has
done so on many occasions.

LUCTUS
It is also my belief, that because -
of his innocence, those
creatures who reside in the
woods did not harm him.

(beat)
This strengthens my belief that
they will let me pass if they
sense ] am not a threat. I ask for
further consideration in my
request to travel into the woods
so that I may gather medicines
and informations from the
nearby town.

Lucius slowly lowers his paper. He exhales very slowly. The elders just
stare.

CUT TO:
EXT. SCHOOLYARD — AFTERNOON ~

Noah makes monster sounds. He holds his hands up like claws as he slowly
chases the pack of Jaughing and screaming children around the playground.

The group of elders have gathered at the edge of the schoolyard. They watch
Noah carefully as he runs around with the other children.

Noah bares his teeth and growls as he catches one of the laughing ten-year-
old boys in the pack. Noah picks him up and throws him to the ground hard.
The child starts crying.

TEACHER
Noah Percy!

Noah stops acting like a monster. He runs and hides behind the other
children. :

The elders watch as the teacher pulls Noah off the schoolyard. Noah is
throwing a slight tantrum as he is led to his punishment.

‘INT. HUNT CABIN - NIGHT

CUT TO:

Alice Hunt sits at her small table. Hands folded on her lap.

ALICE
-” We shall speak of the town, just
this once, and we shall never
speak of it again.

Lucius sits across from her. His eyes flicker from the lamp light on the shelf.

ALICE :
When we lived there, the three
of us, you were but an infant. I
would be telling an untruth if]
said there was no joy. We were
contented souls: the three of
us... But contentment is an
unwelcomed alien in the towns.
There is something in the very
nature of the cities and towns
that rejects it. Society survives
on greed, and desire. Its heart is
fed by wants. It has no place
for something so untradable
and old fashioned as
contentment.

(beat)
Your father left for the market
on a Tuesday at quarter past
nine in the morning... He was
found-robbed and naked in the
river two days later.

Lucius is shaking.

41

LUCIUS

(barely audible)
Why do you tell me this
blackness?

ALICE
So you will know the nature of
what you desire.

LUCIUS
I do not desire it!

Alice is sincerely unsettled by the sight of her son on the verge of yelling.

LUCTUS
My intentions are true to my
word. IJ think of nothing but the
people of this village.

Alice lowers her eyes. Beat. She speaks in a softer voice.

ALICE
1 know that. Forgive me. J am
but scared for my only son’s
life.

LUCIUS
Tam not the one with secrets.

Alice’s eyes lock on his.

ALICE
What is your meaning?

(beat)
Speak! Do not retreat to your
silence yet.

Lucius stands from the table. He moves across the small room.
 

_ 43

LUCIUS
There are secrets in every
comer of this village. Do you
not feel it? Do you not see it?

 

Lucius points to the black box seated in the corner of the room on a small
table. It is identical tothe one we saw in August Nicholson’s house.

ALICE
That is for our own well being.
So the things that scare us do
not have power over us.

LUCTUS
Then let us open it.
ALICE
No-
ww , Alice looks ready to rise from her chair to.stop him. Lucius doesn’t move.

Beat. .
Alice visibly composes herself. Her hands return to her Jap.
ALICE

Edward Walker together. He
may-

LUCIUS
He hides too.

Alice stares quietly at the stranger before her.
LUCIUS

(soft)
He hides his feelings for you.
 

 

 

 

Alice instantly rises from the table and moves into her room with great
dignity. .

LUCIUS
_ (calls to her)
Sometimes we don’t do things -
yet others know we want to do
things - so we don’t do them.

Lucius doesn’t even understand what he said. Alice walks back out of her
room. :

ALICE
What nonsense are you saying?

Lucius is flustered. He gathers his thoughts and looks to his mother. Beat.
LUCIUS
You needn’t worry. Nothing
will happen to me.
Alice gazes upon her son.
ALICE
(gentle)

You remind me of a colt
sometimes.

Alice moves back to the chair she started in. Lucius takes his seat across
from her. Beat.

Alice cleans some dust off the table as she speaks.
" ALICE
What makes you think he has

feelings for me?

Beat. Lucius thinks of other things as he says the words.

 
 

 

45

LUCIUS
He never touches you.

Alice shakes her head, “No” to herself. They both sit at the table plowing
through their own thoughts. CANDLIGHT flickers on this painting of a
mother and son at a wooden table. :

CUT TO:
EXT. BORDER ~ DAY

We are at the edge, where the grass ends and the woods begin. On every tree
that touches the grass is'a yellow slash of paint. Every fourth tree holds a
flag of the same color.

Two young men replace a broken flag. They both wear hooded cloaks that
touch the ground. The cloaks are a mustard-yellow.

The young man, who has been boosted up, loses his balance. He. quickly
grabs a branch and steadiest himself. He looks down to his partner. They
share a tension filled look as they glance into the forest. They work as if they
are on a tight wire.

A third young man in a mustard yellow cloak passes them. Lucius carries a
wooden bucket of yellow paint. He nods to them as he passes.

Lucius walks along the perimeter of trees. He stops a handful of trees down
the line. The paint on this tree is fading. Lucius dips the handmade brush
into the bucket and puts another coat on the tree.

He picks up his bucket and continues on. He glances over his shoulder as the
figures of the two young men get smaller and smaller. Lucius keeps walking.

- He passes the large tree stump.

Now he slows to a stop again. He looks to the woods... Seventy five paces
away from where he stands, nestled between two thin trees, is A BUSH
BLOOMING WITH RED FLOWERS.
 

 

 

46

He looks down the line of trees to the two young men; they move along the
perimeter and slowly move out of sight. .

Lucius steps to the edge of the grass. His shoes are inches away from the
dirt of the forest floor. In the dirt, clearly visible to the eye, are groups of
LARGE CLAWED FOOTPRINTS. The indentations from the claw points
dig deep into the soil.

Lucius does not acknowledge any of this, He stares quietly into the woods,
lowers his bucket to the ground. Beat.

HE STEPS OVER THE FORBIDDEN LINE INTO COVINGTON
WOODS.

Lucius walks calmly. His shoulders graze branches as he moves. His eyes
stay locked on the bush with red flowers.

WE HEAR A NOISE IN THE WOODS. Lucius does not look over.

He takes the last few.steps to the bush. He reaches into it and snaps off a
branch. He straightens up. :

And then for the first time we sense him pausing.

He tums and looks slowly over his shoulder.

THERE IS SUDDEN MOVEMENT. LEAVES AND BRANCHES SNAP
AS WE SEE, FIFTY FEET AWAY, THE DARK FORM OF A HUMPED
CREATURE, STANDING UPRIGHT. IT SUDDENLY MOVES. WE SEE
IT STRIDE AWAY INTO THE DENSENESS OF THE WOODS.

Lucius tums and starts walking. Branch in hand, he moves at a calm even
pace as he heads back to the bucket with yellow paint.

_CUT TO:

_EXT. WALKING PATH — NIGHT

Lucius moves along a walking path. He passes by a LAMP LIGHT.

He gets pulled from the strong current of his thoughts by the rattling of a
bush. He sees someone crawling around in the foliage.

GIRL’S VOICE FROM BUSH
There is no escape. —

Lucius watches as Ivy Walker crawls out and stands. She looks in Lucius’
direction.
IVY
Oh Hello.

Ivy runs her hands over her frock. Dirt and leaves fall off.

IVY
J was just playing a game with
Noah. The rascal must have
gone to hide in my house again.
Houses are against the rules. He
knows that.

Lucius stares at Ivy who has dirt and leaves in her hair. She bends down and
picks up her cane.

IVY
Are you okay? Your quiet is a
different quiet than your usual
quiet.

Lucius nods.

Ivy and Lucius arrive in silence to the back porch of the Walker cabin. In the

_ LAMP LIT windows we see Kitty and her younger sisters talking.

IvY

be with her.

Be well.

Ivy climbs the stairs and stops. :

IVY

you. I know of your request to
go to the towns. I think it is
noble, but I do not think it is
right.

that could help him be still?
- Help him learn?

Beat. This affects Ivy.

right? You know he won’t sit
back in his chair for fear of
setting wrinkles his shirts.

(beat)
But he does have a gentlemanly
way about him and he does care
for my sister deeply. I think
Kitty is blessed.

Ivy
lam blessed as well... My
older sister is now spoken for. I
am now free to receive interest
from anyone... who might have
interest.

Lucius stares at the striking blind girl who stands in the shadows with a
mischievous smile.

IVY

Goodnight Lucius Hunt.

Ivy turns and walks into the house. We see through the open back door as
Noah leaps out from behind a water basin and scares her. Ivy starts chasing
the tall boy around the room playfully. .

Finton Coin sits huddled in the comer of the tower perch. His knees are

tucked into his chest. There is an oil Jamp on the floor by his side.

The oil lamp moves as the tower creaks. Finton sits up. THE LAMP LIGHT
ON FINTON’S TENSE FACE FLICKERS AND THEN RETURNS.

FINTON
Lucius?

SILENCE. Finton crawls over to the trap door in the floor. He listens a
moment before reaching for the rope handle.

He pulls back the wooden door slowly.
Finton looks down the ladder that drops twenty feet away to the ground. The
thick legs of the tower can also be seen.

FINTON

Lucius?

SOMETHING PASSES UNDERNEATH. IT 1S DARK IN FORM AND
MOVES DEVILISHLY QUICK INTO THE SHADOWS.

All the air leaves Finton Coin’s lungs.

Finton shuts the trap door quietly. He moves the wooden bolt into the lock
position. All his movements are slow and trancelike.

Finton places his hands on the railing and pulls himself up. He steadies
himself on his feet. And then peers over the railing.

Kitty holds her little sisters tight. Noah claps his hands joyously in the small
space he has to move.

Lucius and Ivy are crouched together close to the stairs. Their faces are

With deepest sorrow, Lucius
Hunt.

Ivy sits in the crowd. She stares blankly at a point in space.

There are nothing but murmurs for a moment. Edward Walker silently steps
forward. The crowd moves aside ashe-walks through them. .

He moves to the back corner, where the crowd parts and reveals Lucius
sitting against the wall. His eyes are red. Tears fall from his cheeks.

Edward Walker kneels down in front of him.

WALKER
Do not fret.

Walker’s face trembles with emotion as he stares at the young man. Edward
Walker leans forward and whispers in the young man’s ear.

WALKER
(barely audible)
You are fearless in a way, 1
shall never know.

Lucius Jooks up. The two men stare at each other. The crowd goes quiet _.
around them. The overwhelming pride and emotion in Edward Walker’s
eyes slowly start to change Lucius. He grows stronger with every second he -
gazes at his elder.

She stares at the quiet faces of the children.

glorious time. We will sing and
dance and be merry again.
Now let us be strong little souls
and begin the song again from
the very beginning.

 

The children nod gently. They are ready.

Lucius looks up to find Ivy standing before him.

IVY
It is the day of my sister’s
wedding and J am beginning to
believe you would let the day
pass without saying a word to
me.

Lucius doesn’t say a word.

IVY
Perhaps you sensed I was angry

August stands. It is unexpected. Eyes watch him.
