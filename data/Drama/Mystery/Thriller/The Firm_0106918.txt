EXT HARVARD CAMPUS - CAMBRIDGE ~ DAY

Early morning. Students rushing to classes. The SOUND of a
BASKETBALL SLAMMING against the wood floor of a court.

INT GYM - DAY

MITCH MCDEERE, in gray gym shorts plays fierce two-on-two
basketball. It’s an oddball quartet. Mitch is teamed with a
pot-bellied REDHEAD in his 30's. They are playing a large,
MUSCULAR BLACK MAN in his 40’s and a SPARE BUT FIT MAN in his
early 60's.

The Black Man drives into the paint, Mitch all over him. He
fakes, passes to the Elderly Man, who goes over the Redhead for
the score.
MITCH
Son of a bitch!
(immediately mortified)
I mean your Honor, that was a hell
of a shot.

Laughter. The wall clock buzzes. It’s 8:30.

INT FEDERAL COURTROOM DOOR - DAY

In troops the quartet. The Black Man in bailiff uniform with
sidearm, the Redhead the court attendant, Mitch, in worn suit ¢
tie, moves to the clerk’s table, the Elderly Man in robes
ascends to the bench.

BAILIFF
Oyez, oyez, oyez, the United
States Court for the district of
Massachusetts is now in session,
the honorable Brian J.
Hookstratten presiding.

Mitch glances at his watch.

He gets off the bus and approaches the elegant hotel. The plush
burgundy awnings and solid gray stone are impressive. Mitch's

They shake hands violently as Lamar leads Mitch inside.

LAMAR (CONT’D)
--this 1s Oliver Lambert cur
senior partner, and Royce McKnight
our managing partner. Have a
seat.

They all sit. Oliver, late sixties, is mellow and professorial.
McKnight, fifties, cool and detached reminds one of McNamara.
Lamar is a little too obliged to smile whenever Mitch looks at
him.

OLIVER
Care for a drink, Mitch?

On a serving cart are rows of mineral water bottles, coffee,
tea, fruit & cheese. No liquor.

MITCH
Ifm fine.

The three men look at Mitch, who stares pleasantly back, hands
folded, feet on the floor.

OLIVER
Tired of interviews?

MITCH
No sir. I just don’t quite know
what to say.

MCKNIGHT
Unusual for a lawyer.

MITCH
Oh, I can get tongue-tied in any
number of situations. But they’ re
usually with my wife.

Laughter.

OLIVER
Would you mind describing one?
With your wife.

An awkward moment. They wait.

MITCH
Well...the first time I saw
her...anytime we argue... whenever
she walks into a room, as a matter
of fact.

Oliver nods appreciatively, smiles -~ then:

OLIVER
Might we ask about the rest of
your family?

MITCH
(grudgingly)
.. My father was killed in the
coal mines. My mother remarried
and lives in Florida.

MCKNIGHT
Brothers and sisters?

MITCH
An older brother...Ray...
(at their silence)
He..kind of raised me.

MCKINGHT
And what does he do?

MITCH
~-we've lost touch.

OLIVER

(gently but firmly)
Mitch, I hope you don’t think us
intrusive but stability in the
family has a special importance
for us. Bendini, Lambert & Locke
is just a small Memphis fim,
thirty-one lawyers, but we’re a
large family. So we're careful.

MCKNIGHT
What first drew cur attention was
your Harvard Law Rebiew piece on
Capital Gains Reduction in
Maritime Commerce...an imaginative
grasp of the implications.

MITCH
(surprised)
Thank you.

OLIVER
You should know as well that since
we deal primarily in tax and
securities, our clients are very
wealthy.

OLIVER (Cont'd)
Poor people rarely have tax
problems; it’s one of the few
advantages of being poor.
(then playfully:)
Now, sir, do you have any
questions for us?

MITCH
(in kind)
Do you have an offer in mind?

McKnight places a sealed eanvelope on the coffee table.

MCKNIGHT
It includes a bonus schedule, a
low-interest mortgage so you can
buy a home, a country club
membership, and we’d lease you a
new Mercedes.

LAMAR
You pick the color, Mitch.

OLIVER
Lamar you haven’t been paying
attention. His wife picks the
color,

Mitch, somewhat bewildered, locks at the envelope.

MITCH
Do I apen it here?

MCKNIGHT
of course.

QLIVER
..-Unless you can tell us what’s
in it.
Rayce and Lamar look curious. Mitch smiles.

OLIVER (CONT! D)
A lawyer worth that offer -
shouldn’t have to gpen the
envelope.

Mitch looks down at the envelope, looks at the three men.

MITCH
Mr. McKnight, you are the managing
partner at Bendini, Lambert &
Locke, is that correct?

MCKNIGHT
Yes.

MITCH
Did Mr. Lambert, as senior
partner, give you any instructicns
regarding my employment?

MCKNIGHT
He did.

MITCH
And do you usually follow Mr.
Lambert’s instructions?

LAMAR
Objection. Vague, ambiguous--

OLIVER
Sustained.

MITCH
What, precisely, were those
instructions?

MCKNIGHT
That you were in great demand and
that I should make certain we
obtain your services before a
bidding situation developed.

MITCH
And how would you go ahout ‘making
certain’?

MCKNIGHT
I would bribe the clerk in the
Harvard Law Placement Office for
the exact amount of the highest
offer -- and then add twenty
percent.

Mitch stares incredulously at the envelope.

OLIVER
The letter you got from Bendini,
Lambert & Locke was the only one
sent out. We want you, Mitch.

hubcaps rattling, wedges its way into a parking space between a
new Porsche and a 360 SL with Boston University stickers and
decals.

Behind the cracked windshield sits ABBY McDEERE, a breath-taking
young woman in her twenties. She finishes wrestling the car
into the spot, switches off the ignition and groans -~ this is
obviously a daily ritual.

She eyes the door handle with sudden malice, yanks it, shoulders
it open and gets out, spilling her school gear.

The street is peppered with more shiny sportcars of the
collegiate wealthy.

He throws her onto the sofa, leggos and colored pipe cleaners
flying everywhere. He attacks her neck and face, kissing her
madly, finally locking her in a long sweet embrace.

ABBY
OK, you’ll have to leave now, I’m
expecting my husband.

MITCH
The hell with him, come here-

HEARSAY, their mutt jumps up as Mitch pulls Abby to her feet and
leads her to the candle-lit kitchen table.

Elegant, as it glides through the downtown streets. In the

He’s replaced the boxes and is on the way out when he knocks
over his beer bottle. Frozen, he watches the beer spilling.

so they can stay rich -~ and the

EXT - HOLIDAY INN REAR PATIO - NIGHT 88

A BAND fills the open-air bar with its good-natured beat. A
party crowd spills everywhere -~ tables, bar area, dance floor.
The attire is varied, from business suits to bikinis. Lots of
exposed flesh and forced gaiety. Loud.

Around the pool, piles of food spread out on folding tables.
Grilled Grouper, barbecued shark, pompano, fried shrimp, turtle
and oysters, lobster and red snapper.

On the dance floor Avery, arms outspread, dances with abandon.
His partner, CARRIE, a buxom blonde, short hair and long tan
legs tries good-naturedly to keep up.

Away from the dance floor, at a table close to the beach, an
unsmiling Mitch sits drinking rum with Carrie’s friend, JULIE,
a very pretty brunette in jeans and bathing suit top. She’s a
little loaded. Her breasts are pressed against his arm as she
leans in talking earnestly, incessantly.

MITCH
(quietly)
Look, I don’t mean to hurt your
feelings but this isn’t going to
happen... Would you tell my friend
that I’m going back to the hotel.

She stares at him a moment. Her eyes grow cold. Mitch reaches
across the table and picks up Avery’s rum as he stands.

JULIE
You don’t know what you're
missing.

He walks out onto the dark beach, carrying the drink.

EXT SEVEN MILE BEACH ~ MITCH - NIGHT. 89
troubled and thoughtful as he walks the deserted beach. Faint
strains of music drift from the beach bars. He passes an
occasional beach chair, an abandoned beach towel, as he moves
along the light surf.

He slows. Something ahead catches his attention.

EXT BEACH - MITCH’S POV - NIGHT 90
In the distance two ghostly figures seem to be struggling at the
water’s edge. It’s almost in slow motion and the wind carries

an eerie sound, halfway between a high whistle and a human cry.
Mitch enters SHOT slowly, then picks up his pace.

The struggle seems to continue as he gets closer.

One of the figures, clearly a WOMAN, falls and we hear her cry

out, but the cry is muted by the wind and the surf. The MAN
picks her up and shakes her like a rag doll.

EXT BEACH - ANOTHER ANGLE 91
Suddenly the MAN stops struggling and looks. We cannot make out
his face, but he clearly stares at Mitch, who stops, stands

still, returning the stare through the darkness.

The Man lets go of the girl and bolts off the beach and up
through the grounds of one of the condos.

The Woman tries to move away, but is obviously hurt. She
stumbles, then falls to the sand with a sharp intake of breath.

Mitch approaches cautiously.

MITCH
You all right?

No answer. She gets up and tries to take a step, but falls
forward onto her knees in the sand. He kneels beside her and
tries to ease her over onto her back.

She pulls the long dark hair away from her face and looks
directly at him. She's in her early 20s, exotic, and so
strikingly beautiful it literally sets Mitch back on his heels.

He recovers, sees an abandoned beach towel nearby, retrieves it
and tears it into two pieces. Then he kneels and begins to bind
her ankle.

MITCH
You should ice this.

She is still, except for the sound of her breathing.

MITCH (CONT‘D)
You should also report that guy.

She looks away, shakes her head slightly.

MITCH (CONT'D)
Oh.... that was your boyfriend.

She continues looking away.

That was... for money.

Mitch freezes,

He stops bandaging, sits back onto the sand. The Young Woman
looks back directly at him.

His hand rests on her ankle where he’s finished wrapping it.
She looks up at him...then takes his hand... and brings it up to
her mouth where she kisses it.

MITCH

..-hey...

She places his hand on her breast, running his index finger
around her nipple. He starts to pull back. She inhales
quickly, pulls his hand up, bites his finger. Then she moves
his hand back to her breast.

YOUNG WOMAN
...Can you stay with me for
awhile?

He starts to speak. Doesn’t. She guides his hand to her top
button. She feels Mitch’s hand flutter, as she guides him
through unbuttoning it. She moves his hand down.

Her shoulders and stomach are exposed. The single remaining
button at her breast bone holds the biouse tautly over her
nipples and lower breast.

He looks out toward the water, eyes closed, then locks back down
at her.

His hand is frozen over the last button.

Mr. McDeere~-can I call you Mitch?
(no response)
My name is Voyles, Denton Voyles.
I’m with the Department of
Justice. We've been--

MITCH
~- What happened to Eddie Lomax?
But Voyles simply holds up his hand -= to silence him.
VOYLES

Mitch, we’ve been investigating
Bendini, Lambert & Locke for four
years.

(then)
--.no lawyer has ever left your
law firm alive.

Mitch is very still.

VOYLES
Two tried to leave ~~ they were
killed. Two were about to try.
You know what happened. We have
reason to believe your house and
your car are bugged, your phones
are tapped and your office is
wired. They follow you and
sometimes your wife. They may be
here in Washington as we speak.

MITCH
...Are you Saying my life is in
danger?

VOYLES

«..I'm saying your life, as you
know it...is over.

FEATURE Mitch stunned, pale.

VOYLES (CONT’ D}
Your law firm is the sole
of the Morolto
Crime family in Chicago. Known in
the tabloids as The Mafia. The
Mob.

MITCH

VOYLES

They set up legitimate businesses
with dirty money. All cash. All
moved offshore...And you do
believe it, Mitch, that’s why you
talked to Thomas Abanks in the
Caymans - that’s why you got this
private investigator asking
questions that got him killed.

Mitch sags forward, elbows on his knees.

VOYLES (CONT’ D}
They’ve got a very good front --
Maybe thirty percent of their
clients are legitimate. They
bring in a new rookie, throw money
at him, buy the car, the house.
After a couple of years when your
kids are in private schools, and
you’re used to the good life, they
tell you the truth.

Mitch begins to shiver.

MITCH
...You mean every partner...?

VOYLES
Every partner knows. We suspect
most of the associates. We don’t
know about the wives.

MITCH
Why don’t you get indictments and
Bust it all up?

VOYLES
They’re lawyers. Smart ones and
very, very careful. We have to
have someone on the inside. We
need copies of contracts, client’s
bank records, articles of
incorporation.

MITCH
Wait a minute, you think i'm -

VOYLES
You can say no, But we’re going
to break this Firm... and when
that happens--you‘’ll go to jail
along with the rest. It will
happen, son, believe me.

VOYLES
+-That's what Kozinski and Hodge
were trying to do.

MITCH
.»-What about my wife? can she
leave?

VOYLES

I wouldn't advise that. You both
have to behave as though
everything is normal. Don’t talk
to anyone-~ but make a decision.
If you help us, we'll make it
worth your while.

MITCH
Worth my while...?

VOYLES
You can still have a pretty good
life.

MITCH

You mean in a witness protection
program? one day I‘m backing out
of the driveway and my car
explodes!

VOYLES

That's nonsense. You cought to get
back or they’1l be suspicious.
Tarrance will be in touch. Ke has
full authority to negotiate on our
behalf.

Why don’t you wander back past the

MITCH
Reveal privileged information
that’d violate attorney~client
confidences-~-get me disbarred, and
then testify in open court against
the Mafia.

TARRANCE
~~Well, unfortunately~-

MITCH

Let me ask you something. Are you
out of your fucking mind?

He turns away.

TARRANCE

How long before they find out
Lomax was your brother’s cellmate?

Mitch turns back sharply -~ stares at Tarrance.

TARRANCE (CONT’ D}
And what do you think they'll do
to him? They can reach anyone
inside the wall.

MITCH
(very quiet)
..-What can you do?

TARRANCE
Maybe we can get him into
protective isolation. And doesn’t
his parole come up in awhile. You
cooperate with us, I'll guarantee
the parole board will be grateful.

The Limo drops Mitch off in front. the sprinklers are on. The
SOUND of music from within: TOSCA. SMOKE from burning leaves
softens the light.

Mitch approaches his doorway, but stops. He watches Abby
through the glass, stricken.

She moves from the stove to the refrigerator preparing dinner --
a graceful ritual that, given the music, seems almost a dance.

She looks up, spots Mitch. For a moment she’s startled. As
though he’s a mirage. Then a radiant smile.

She watches puzzled as he turns TOSCA up loud, Then he moves to
her, takes her in his arms. His mouth is at her ear. He begins
to whisper. CAMERA TIGHTENS on her face as we watch her eyes go

from bewilderment, to fear, to terror aS the Opera soars. HOLD
FOR A BEAT.

EXT MCDEERE HOUSE ~ NIGHT 126

Her figure is a blur as she tears out of the house and runs with

They walk. The only SOUND is her ragged breath.

EXT A PARK ~ NIGHT 127

Sits in the grass, weak, shaking. Mitch sits beside her.

The impossibility of it washes over her and she has to lie back
on the grass. She stares up at the stars.

IN THE HALLWAY: He moves with purpose toward the Xerox machine.
He checks his watch, checks to see that he’s alone.

XEROX AREA: He pushes the start button on a large machine. It
comes to life and an ALARM GOES OFF. Mitch almost panics. He
begins to push at buttons. He can’t stop the SOUND.

SUDDENLY Lamar appears, coat on, umbrella in hand, laughing.

LAMAR

Lamar punches a code and the alarm stops. Mitch is flustered,
tries to make the files as inconspicuous as possible.

Mitch is about to say no -- but he recognizes Tammy. He’s

He nods to Tammy, who follows him into the office. She puts her
bag on his desk. He digs into his pocket, eyes on her.

He hands her a Ten -- she puts it in her pocket. No change.

trunk of the Limo, opens it, takes a briefcase.

DEVASHER (CONT! D)
So Mitch, this is a debriefing.
I know what you’ve told the
fellas, so I pretty much get the
picture. Now it’s my job to give
you the picture. What I’m
concerned about, son, is this -
the FBI wouldn’t have come after
you if they didn’t think they
could get to you. What do you
think made them think that?

MITCH
I have no idea.

DEVASHER
It’s my job to have an idea about
that. For example, they might
know how much your wife means to
you. They might use that.

MITCH
How?

DEVASHER

had the afternoon off and ..well,

DEVASHER (CONT? D)
Imagine hér opening that. Go
ahead.

Mitch opens it. There are four Pictures. They are of Mitch and
the Girl_on the beach -- making love.

DEVASHER (CONT’ D)
Devastating. Not just screwing
Mitch, but the kind of intimate
acts, oral and whatnot, that could
be particularly hard for a
trusting young wife to forgive,
and impossible to forget. The FBI
is capable of just this sort of
coercion. So watch yourself,
Mitch. I’1l1 do my best to protect
you ~ and I know you'll do your
best to protect the firm. If the
FBI so much as smiles in your
direction again you'll let me
know, won't you? Won’t you Mitch?

There is champagne in a bucket of ice. Abby moves toward it.

He moves up behind her, puts his arms around her from behind.
She stops. He turns her face sideways, and kisses her.

His hands move up and begin undeing the buttons of her blouse.
She closes her eyes.

He’s unbuttoned the three buttons, and pulls the blouse out of
the skirt. Still standing behind her, he slides the blouse off

She’s wearing a camisole. He reaches for the delicate straps,

For a fleeting moment he’s aware of what’s happening.

MITCH CONTINUES to the landing, but as he turns to go up the
next flight, he continues his turn, and in one fluid motion
KICKS at the injured leg of the Squat man, sending him toppling
down the stairs.

THE CROWD near Mitch is stunned. He wants to disappear quickly.

He looks up toward the flight above him and spots The Nordic,
breathing heavily, coming down the stairs.

MITCH IS in motion back down the flight he just came up.

Halfway down he yaults. the railing and hits the ground running.

EXT BUILDING ~ DAY 2
Mitch turns at right angles and races into the Parking lot.

ON THE STREET, Devasher’s car passes on the way to the Mud
Island Tram. He spots Mitch running into the parking lot, hits
the brakes, and makes a U-turn.

CAMERA PANS WITH U-TURN to reveal the Nordic approaching fast.
PARKING LOT as Mitch races through. A MAINTENANCE CREW opens
the fire door, carrying out some’garbage. Mitch, unaware that
Devasher has spotted him, bolts into the building.

ON THE STREET, Devasher SHOUTS to the Nordic .

INT BUILDING - STAIRWELL - MITCH 2!
climbing the fire stairs two and three at a time.

THE NORDIC is racing up the stairwell three flights behind
Mitch. He draws a SILENCED gun, carefuliy fires a shot that
vichochets off the concrete.

DEVASHER stands below, says quietly, ‘Save it. He’s got
nowhere to go but the roof.’

WITH MITCH scrambling up the last flight. He hits the FIRE
EXIT door and opens it,

EXT BUILDING ROOF - POV ~ DAY 25
A flat roof with virtually nowhere to hide.

MITCH turns back to see the Nordic racing upwards below him.
He looks to the wall. A FIRE ALARM, and next to it, a thick
Ganvas fire hose on a wheel, with a heavy brass handle.

He frantically pulls the wheel out from the wall and drops the
hose into the stairwell. He waits, and when the Nordic is
coming up the last flight toward him he pulls the FIRE ALARM,
and -~

Grabs the hose, sliding down it, using his feet to anchor him,
and to keep him away from the walis.

The surprised Nordic tries to get off a shot, but Mitch is a
blur as he drops past him. THE ALARM IS SCREECHING.

The Nordic stows his weapon, grabs the hose and begins to slide
down after Mitch.

11/2/92 127.

Two flights go smoothly, then SUDDENLY the Nordic is

across the face with Mitch’s belt, as he passes Mitch standing
on the stairs. The Nordic loosens his grip momentarily, and
slides too fast, out cf control.

Mitch grabs the rope and swings it hard.

Below, the Nordic careens into a wall, lets go ~ plummets down,
slams into the bottom of the stairweil.

Devasher sees the Maintenance Crew rushing toward the building,
drawn by the Alarm. He moves quickly out.

INT PEABODY HOTEL = SUITE - TONY AND JOEY MOROLTO ~ DAY 258
Tony, on phone, in shirt and tie, paces the suite seething.

TONY

{into phone, coolly)
Of course I can talk. Why, isn’t
that what I’m doing? I mean if
it’s something else, please advise
me Maury. I always like to learn
something I don’t know at five
hundred dollars an hour~

(cups his hand over the

phone)
I tell you Joey, every fucking
lawyer on the face of the earth
eughta be killed.

Joey is calmer. He sits on the sofa, his feet on a coffee
table. He downs an espresso in one gulp.

TONY (CONT’ D)

-you’re going to what,? You want
to meet with him? what for? so the
two of you can charge me a thousand
dollars an hour before they send me
to Joliet for thirty years? Let’s
not fart around Maury. This kid’s
cut a deal and he knows how to do
it. After all-

(viciously)
~he’s my lawyer.

He slams the phone down, turns to his brother.
TONY (CONT’D)
Jusus, Mary, Mother of God if only
I could get my hands on this kid-

Their secretary RUTH, middle-aged and pleasant, but firm,
appears in the doorway. Tony waves her off.

RUTH
I think it’s urgent, Mr. Morolto.

Tony turns to his brother and smiles.
TONY
Ruth thinks it’s urgent, Joey.
What do you think?

RUTH
It’s a Mr. McDeere. Mr. Mitchell
McDeere. He’s waiting to see you.

The longest pause in the movie.

JOEY
I think Ruth is right.

She leaves. Joey and Tony look at one another.

JOEY {CONT’ D)
Sometimes, Tony ~

TONY
Sometimes what?

But Mitch stands in the doorway. He’s pulled himself together
fairly well, but a few scrapes are showing.

The second longest pause in the movie.

MITCH
I’m Mitch McDeere...I’m your attorney.
One of them anyway.

Both men nod. Barely.

MITCH (CONT! D)
I assumed you knew...but I thought
I’d mention it...in case.

Mitch clears his throat. He’s tired. The two men he’s facing
look rested and fit as wild cats.

MITCH (CONT'D)
Well, I guess I should try to get
started. I'’11]1 try not to take up
too much of your time.

Tony is still pacing, behind Mitch now, and it clearly makes
him uncomfortable.

JOEY
Would you care to sit down?

(CONTINUED)

11/2/92 129.

CONTINUED: (2) 256

MITCH
Not really. I want to try and --
this is just very awkward.

The brothers never take their eyes off Mitch - Tony pacing,
Joey motionless.

MITCH (CONT’ D)
I’m afraid ~ my firm - has behaved
in an unethical manner.

He waits for a question, Some word. Nothing. They wait.

MITCH (CONT’ D)
It seems that - we - Bendini,
Lambert and Locke, the entire firm
has been engaged in a - well a
conspiracy. We've been -
(a breath}
- overbilling our clients.

The brothers for the first time take their eyes off Mitch and
look at each other. Just as if Joey had asked him, Tony stops
pacing. He walks over to the couch and sits down next to his
brother. The two men lock up at Mitch.

MITCH (CONT’D)
- in some cases massive overbilling.
I assure you I had no idea any of
this was going on when I joined the
firm.

Mitch waits for a reaction. The two man just look at him.

MITCH (CONT D)
Well I feel that I have to report
this criminal behavior, but I can‘t
use your invoices without your
written authorization.

TONY
Our invoices?

JOEY
(gently)
Please, Tony. Listen.

MITCH
Your bills. You see, it’s an
important part of the proof that
we've overbilled you.

JOEY
That’s it?

MITCH
Pretty mich. Most of our clients
have agreed to allow me to turn
their bills over to the government.

JOEY
Most of your clients.

MITCH
Pretty much all. Except for you.
Which is why I’m here.

JOEY
You want us to let you turn our
bills -

MITCH

- what we charged you, I should say
overcharged you ~

JOEY
~over to the government,

MITCH
Yes sir.

JOEY
«.sNow does that -

MITCH

There is a change in Mitch’s tone. Still respectful,

someone with a strong point of view.

MITCH (CONT'D)

“waive your rights to full and
complete confidentiality in any
other area of the attorney-client
relationship.

(pause)
I’m your lawyer...Tony.. whether I
like it or not. I can’t talk to
the government about you even when
I’m no longer your lawyer. That
would be breaking my word and my
oath.

TONY
Okay, Mitch. What about stealing
our files and Xeroxing them? What
the fuck was that all about?

MITCH
The files in the Caymans haven’t
been stolen. They are in exactly
the same place they were. Whatever
I know, wherever I go, I’m bound by
the attorney-client privilege. I’m
very much like, I would say exactly
like, a ship carrying a cargo that
will never reach any port. And as
long as I’m alive that ship will
always be at sea, so to speak.

The brothers get the picture.

JOEY
Like Yasser-fucking-Arafat, never a
night in the same place - so to
speak.

At that moment, Ruth enters again.
RUTH
I’m sorry, but there’s a call for
Mr. McDeere.

Mitch looks at his watch, looks at the brothers, who nod very
slightly. Mitch picks up the phone.

MITCH
Hello...just a minute.

He holds the phone to his chest, looks at Joey and Tony.
MITCH (CONT’D)

Excuse me Gentlemen, I’m afraid I
need your answer.

TONY

A phalanx of FBI cars and a PLAIN TRUCK arrive in front of the
building. Tarrance leads a detail, several men with furniture
dollies, inside the building.

INT GREENWOOD SECRETARIAL - LATE AFTERNOON 260

The door opens. The men with furniture dollies all pour in.
Tarrance comes forward.

There is nothing but a small stack of xeroxed pages, carefully
placed under a lamp.

The men look to Tarrance, who moves slowly toward the tiny
stack of pages.

He moves through the disorder to the bedroom.

Tarrance appears in the bedroom doorway, holding the small
folder of papers Mitch left him.

TARRANCE (CONT'D)
You sonofabitch, I ask for crooks,
you give me their accountants! You
det the Moroltos off the hook--

MITCH
(packing)
-~They were my clients.

TARRANCE
They were the crooks!

MITCH
What would you call the Firm?

TARRANCE
A bunch of chickenshit lawyers whoa
padded their bills--

MITCH
You been with the Bureau too long,
you’re a “G” man, Tarrance, you
want Dillinger. There’s a whole
bunch of new bad guys - with expensive
haircuts and terriffic manners.

TARRANCE
That’s double talk! - you made a
deal to save your ass~

MITCH
--That’s the way it started-
TARRANCE
~you were this close to being one
of them!-
MITCH

~-that’s right. They invited me in
and I jumped. They counted on me
not to ask too many questions, and
they were right. When you're

Yeah? when? - all I see is you made

MITCH
The money was always for someone
else. Yeah, I’m a lawyer -- with
refrences from Bendini, Lambert and
Locke. You want to put that in
your resumé?

Past Tarrance, but turns and stops.

MITCH (CONT‘ D)
And what if one of thase guys tries
toa make a deal?-~- they probably
will -- that’s what they do for a
living, isn’t it? He'll testify
against the Moroltos in exchange
for immunity. You think I’m ever
going to turn the ignition key of
my car without sweating.

He walks into the other room. Tarrance follows.

IN THE DINING ROOM, Mitch puts the suitcase down, goes to a
shelf where he keeps cassettes. Tarrance enters.

TARRANCE
Then what the fuck did you do it
for? You didn’t win a thing.

Yeah I did. I won my life back.
You don’t run me...and they don’t

(then)
And you want to know something
weird? I discovered the law again.
You actually made me think about
it. I managed to get through 3
years of law school without doing
that.

Tarrance shakes his head, starts to leave.

MITCH
Tarrance?

Tarrance turns. Mitch tosses him a mini~cassette.

MITCH (CONT'D)

It’s you at the dog track.

Why didn’t you?
MITCH
.--It’s against the law.

You ought to play it back a few
times before you get rid of it.

Suddenly, the pad of paws on the floor, and Hearsay comes over
to Mitch. Mitch grows pale. He whirls, and sees Abby entering.
They look at one another. Then to Tarrance:

MITCH
Anything else?

TARRANCE
Yeah...the justice dept has asked
me to congatulate you for handing
them the biggest mail fraud case in
the last 20 years.

He nods to Abby, goes. A long beat as Abby looks at Mitch.

ABBY
Well...you’ve had a busy day.

Mitch almost smiles,

MITCH
I thought you were going to your

He turns, leans on the dining room table. Abby moves up to
him. She’s at his back, clearly hesitant about touching him.

ABBY
I‘ll tell you exactly what happened.

MITCH
(without turning)
OK...Whatever you think I should
know.

ABBY
I think you should know that Avery
was...pretty decent. He was...tormented...unhappy.
It’s what happened to him. And it .
might have happened to you. You
might have begun to drink...and run
around. And lost me.

He turns.

She studies him.

He returns her gaze...then nods.
