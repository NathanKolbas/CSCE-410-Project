Ext PARKING LOT DARE

A guy's tortured face.

MORT RAINEY site in the driver's seat of his car, knuckles white
on the wheel. Frozen. Sis face is wet with tears.

He wipes hia cheaks in irritetion, puts the car in gear ard
ateps on the gas, pulling out of the parking lot he's been
parked in. We rolj with him, still staring at his face as he
hauls around a corner and ont onto the road, into a mid-winter
snow storm, just after dawn.

Suddenly he CURSES, double«foots the brakes, stops abruptiy in
the middle of the road, site there for a moment --~

-- and puts the car in reverse. He backs right back into the

parking lot, back to the very spot he was before, where be comes
to a atop. He freezes with his hand on the gear shife --

~~ then puts it in park and climbs out of the car, leaving the
deor hanging open, the car BINGING at him about the keya, tha
lights, you‘re doing avarythizg wrong.

Mort walks across the parking lot -- still doesn't want to go,
still can't stop. He's headed for tha doors of a strip #otel,
the kind where you park your car in front of your room, a twelve-
cabins-twalve-vacancias kind of place, .

He walks straight toward door number 6, the only door with a car
parkad in front of it. wo cars, as a matter of fact. He walks
right between them, up to the door of the room, and triez the
handle seftiy. Locked, of course.

Ne thinks for a monent, then turns and walks eff to the left.

We otay where we are, watch as he walks toward the lighted motel
offices at the end of the row. Mort goes ineide, the door
JINGLES, we see throngh the window as he walks behind the
unattended front counter. He‘ takes something off the well,

turns and walks bask out, holding a key.

Just as he leaves, we see a MANAGER in a tee shirt come out from
the back room, looking around to see what happened.

Re figures it out and takes off after Mort, but by that time
Mort is alraady back at tha door to number & again, He siides
the key inte the lock, turns the handle and shoves the door
open, harder than he intended to.

IN? MOTEL ROOM DAWS 2

The door BANGS off the cheap drywall, and as the morning light
spills into the room wa gat a look at tha instrument of Mort's

torture.

We can't be sure, of courss, but it's a pratty good bet it's the
WAXED COUPLE asleep in the twisted, lova-stained sheets. Weil,
they vore asleap, now they're svake and all hell breaka Loose.

They're horrified, shocked esd caught end humiliated.

There's so mch noise and jumping around there's no point
writing down the dialogue, because we can't make out more than a
word or two of it anyway. But all the words have besn shouted
before verbatim, and by the way Mort is yelling at the Naked
Woman and the Naked Man is ecreaming at Mort to caim down we can
tell who got fneked over and who did the fucking.

And sow the Motel Manager arrives and jumps into the mix,
SHOUTING and waving just Iixe the others, God whet a mesa.

It's sweaty and ugly and painful, a0 we pull back the vay we
cams, out the door of tha room, back into the snow-driven
parking lot, leaving them te themselves.

Another couple walks past the room, the WOMAN slows down,
atraing for a look at the wreck, the GUY pulls her along, are

We fly townrd a house at the edge of the laks, a nice littie

Mort's pet os about aix years in the past six montha, and the
overlong midday nep he’s buried in doesn't help. Yeoh, there's
axied drool.

A ENCCR on the front door gate no response trom Mort but it
draws our attention. Approaching the door, we sea a DARK FIGURE
move to the window naxt to the door. ‘The drapes are drawn so we
just see 4 silhouette as the figure tries to peer through the
window. Then it moves back to the door.

Another knovk, louder now. And then, surprisingly, the doorknob
turns a few times, stopped by the lock. This guy wants in.

A third knock, really s pounding, is abruptly cut off as Mort
jerks the door open, revealing the man on tha porch.

But it’s the hat that catches your attention. It's a big black |

Finally, there is a soft THUMP, followed by work shoes on porch,
then work shoes on grevel. Nort goss to the window and touches
the ourtain aside.

Through the window, he seas Shooter crunching across the
driveway toward hie car. From this angle, Mort can make out the
license plate's state of iasue -- Mississippi.

Shoater opens the door, gets behind the whecl, tosses his hat on
the seat next to him. Hs starts the car, puts it in reverse,
and backs all the way down the driveway, cut to the road.

Mort sighs. That's over. But then a worrisome thonght crosses
his mind. He looks back at tha door.

ExT FRONT FORCE DAZ 7

Shooter's manuscript sits on the front porch, a rock resting on
top of the title page to keep it from blowing away, ‘he edges
of the pages flutter in the wind.

Mort stands on the front porch, barefoot, hands in the pockets
of his khaki pants, looking down at it. Sard to tell hov long
he'a been etanding like this, just staring sat the thing,

Ha looks up the driveway, makes sure Shooter really is gone. He

squats down next to the manuscript, wants to get a closer look
but doesn't want to touch it. Re picks up the rock, tosses it

into the bushes.

the title page blows off the stack, blown by the breeze, and
Mort catches it. He turna it around and reads it.

INT KITCHEN DAY li

In the kitchen, Hort takea a can of Coke out of the fridge and
knocks it shut with his hip. Ha notices a stack of paper on the
counter and bends over, not racognizing it. It‘s spotted with
orange jaice and a few coffee grounds, but the title page is

still clear:

Secret Window, Sacret Gardez
by John Shooter

How'd it do that? He threw it ont. In the background, MRS. \
GAVIN, the cleaning lady, brings the canister vacuum to a crash-
landing on the living room floor, visible through the opan door.

Mrs. Gavin treats Mort with the overly kind, somewhat irritating /
concarn one gives a victim of a terminal dizease. °

MRS. GAVIN
I found one of your stories in the
trash, Me. Rainey. I thought you might
want it, so I put it on the counter.

° NORT
I gee that.

Curious, he turns over. the title page and picks up the
manuscript. As he reads the first few sentences, we creep
closer to his face and hear his inner voice:

get it away from hin, knocking over his can of Coke in the
process.

Mrs. Gavin comes in a hurry, surveys the situation, sees that
it's just spilled Coke, and graba a towel.

He moves out of the way, and the first thing she does is pick up
the manuseript and put it back in his hands. Mort looks down at
the fucking thing in inritstion, can’t get away from it, Row
it's stained with coxa tac.

on his left, the book next to it on his right.

He reads. Compares sentences,

Pages flip, middle of ths story now. Things are moving faster,
Tompy .

More pages, near the end, Mort's face is mweaty, he's grinding

Last page, shit, this got worse and worss, he shoves them both
away from him and sits back, breathing hard. He stares for a
moment, shocked still -~

-- and then snaps out of it and starts searching the desk,
almost frantic. Doors rip open, are rifled and slammed shut,
papers overturned, swept aside. Dig, dig, dig, past junk mail,
paper clips, cancelled checks, old Dordtos. Finally, lifting up
@ thick, heavily marked manuscript, he unearths the mother lode,

A aun~faded, nearly flattened cold pack of LaN's. Mort lets go a
happy GASP, picks tham up and pokes them open.

Three cigarettes are lined up neatly iaside, only a little
squashed,

She SIGHS and he looks back up.

The door swings wide and Amy tekes a step inte the study. The
first thing she notices is Mort’s computer moniter, which bas
been swept off the desk and is lying oa its side on the floor,
where it imploded. .

On the desk iu ite place is an old Royal typewriter. A typed
wanuscript is neatly stacked on top of it. Amy takes a quick
eok around the room and walks toward it «+

«- passing Mort, who is standing just behind the door, hands
folded primly behind his back, Shooter's hat perched atop his

baad.

She doesn't notice. And he doesn't move. Amy crosaea the room
te the desk and comes sround behind it, peering dewn at the

manuscript. The title page is on top:

She looks up and sees *Shooter* is alao written on the walla of

follows the lines, but as she nears the end of it, the last one
dessa‘t say “Shooter” anymore, somehow it has avolvad into two

Mort, younger, is at a rummage sale in the country with Amy. He

Amy races dewn the front steps of the cabin and to her car. She
throws open the door and leaps inside, SLAMMING down the locks.

Through the passenger window, we see Mort walk calmly out of the
house after her. She fumbles for bar keys, pawing for the right

one,

Mort walks toward the car, bending down when be gets near it,
just cat of our sight, below the window line.

But Mort lunges through the windew and grabs hold of that hand,
