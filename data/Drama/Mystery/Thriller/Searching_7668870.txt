As he speaks, David scrolls up through his texts with Margot,
only to confirm that:

She’s been asking for cash every week to pay for the classes.
MRS. SHAHINIAN (V.O.)
Maybe five months ago. I can’t
remember. I don’t have my planner.
Is she looking to restart lessons?

And judging by the picture of the hundred-dollar bill on the
kitchen counter David sent two weeks ago...

DAVID (V.O.)
No. Hold on. That doesn’t make
sense, though. She loves piano.

David has been consistently paying.

MRS. SHAHINIAN (V.O.)
Mr. Kim, is everything okay?

DAVID (V.O.)
(shaken from his daze)
No, yeah. Of course. Thank you.
David ends the call and REOPENS the-

David is texting Peter.

Just talked to school.
She didn’t come to class today.
Okay.

That is weird.

But hold on.

Hasn't she skipped school before?

Yeah.
Without telling you.
Once.
Do-Houthinksomethigthad
Here’s what I think
Remember that time
In 10th grade
I road-tripped to LA
with Scott Veltri and his cousin
How-does this have anything

I didn’t tell Eomma or Appa.
I was an idiot.
They were SO MAD.

I was off the grid for like 24 hours.

But you didn’t have a cell phone.

I wouldn't have called if I did.

And it was summer break.

Isn't school over next week?

Yeah.

You're right.

Exactly.
Pink Rev. (11/04/16) 25.

She's probably just screwing around with her friends.

Have you reached out to them?
The cursor blinks. Thinking. Then David TRAVELS to-
GOOGLE - LINUX WEB BROWSER

David searches: “Margot Kim social media san jose” and OPENS
the three most recognizable links in different tabs, but-

INSTAGRAM WEBSITE - LINUX WEB BROWSER
Her Instagram profile is locked.
TWITTER WEBSITE - LINUX WEB BROWSER
Her Twitter only has one tweet ("fiNCIrst tweet ever!!!")

Ok well...

If you don’t know any of her friends

Who would?
Beat.

David HIGHLIGHTS “who would” as we hear the STARTING SOUNDS
of a Windows XP OS and-

LOGIN SCREEN - OLD FAMILY COMPUTER

The old Windows XP Family Home Computer BOOTS UP.

On the profile selection page, David's cursor glides over the
icons for “Dad” and “Margot” before settling on “Mom,” the

answer to Peter's earlier question.

David CLICKS on her profile. Loading, loading. And then-
Pink Rev. (11/04/16) 26.

DESKTOP - OLD FAMILY COMPUTER

The original first-day-of-school family selfie (kindergarten)
appears as Pam’s wallpaper before the remaining icons load.

Suddenly, a notification pops up at the bottom of the screen:
“You have not run Norton Anti-Virus software in 694 days."
Clearly, it’s been awhile since anyone used this computer.

From the Start Menu, David OPENS the-

ADDRESS BOOK

He searches through Pam’s groups of contacts, scrolling by
“My Friends,” “David Friends,” and “Family” before finally
landing on one called “Sunwood Middle School.”

He OPENS it, only to be met with 52 daunting contacts files.
He CLICKS through. Each file is named after kids Margot knew
and lists home phone numbers, notes about the kid, his/her
parents as well as their jobs (i.e.. mom works at incubator,
on the same little league team, etc).

David starts at the top of the alphabetized list with “Abolt,
Marvin.” Pam’s notes on the card read: “had a crush on margot
in 3rd grade, parent in law enforcement, divorced family."

David HIGHLIGHTS the first part ("had a crush on margot")
while we hear PRE-LAPPED RINGING and AUDIO from the call.

SHARP FEMALE VOICE (V.O.)

Hello?

DAVID (V.O.)
Hi. I was wondering if I could
speak to... Marvin? Is he home?

SHARP FEMALE VOICE (V.O.)
Who's this?

DAVID (V.O.)
My name is David. I’m calling in
regards to my daughter, Margot Kim.
She and your son went to Sunwood
Middle School together, I believe.
I just haven’t been able to reach
Margot for close to a day now. So
I'm just kinda... cold-calling...
to see if someone can point me in
the right direction.

Beat.
27.
SHARP FEMALE VOICE (V.O.)
Can I put you on hold?

DAVID (V.O.)
Of course. Thank you.

Meanwhile, we watch David export the entire “Sunwood Middle
School” group from the Address Book to the-

DESKTOP

David plugs in a USB, reformats it to FAT32 after it’s
incompatible with the Windows OS, and-

SHARP FEMALE VOICE (V.O.)
Mr. Kim?

DAVID (V.O.)
Uh huh.

SHARP FEMALE VOICE (V.O.)
My son hasn’t spoken to Margot
since middle school.

DAVID (V.O.)
Okay.

SHARP FEMALE VOICE (V.O.)
Do you not know any of her friends
now?

DAVID (V.O.)
That was really my wife’s domain.
But I’m working on it.

The call ends. David drags the zip file from the desktop onto
the USB and the Windows upload bar MATCH CUTS to a-

MAC DOWNLOAD BAR - DAVID’S PERSONAL LAPTOP

The file downloads onto David's personal laptop and-
FACETIME - AN HOUR LATER

We see AUDIO WAVEFORMS as we hear the end of another call.

DAVID (V.O.)

The line CUTS OUT and through the open FaceTime Video display- *

INT. DAVID’S BEDROOM - NIGHT (FACETIME VIDEO) 21

We see David move his cursor from the second-to-last name in
the “Sunwood Middle School” contacts list to the last name.

He massages his temples, fear growing in every crease. Then
from his phone, he dials the final contact: “Williams, Isaac
("met in little league, sweet kid, mom runs PTA").

ISAAC'S MOM (V.O.)
Hello?

DAVID
Hi. My name is David Kim, I’m--

ISAAC’S MOM (V.O.)

--Pam’s husband, of course I *

remember. How are you doing? *
DAVID

I’m good. I’m good. Listen-- *

ISAAC’S MOM (V.O.)

--You know I have been meaning to *
call you. Just to make sure you and *
Margot were-- *
DAVID

--That’s very nice of you, but... *
Listen, reason I’m calling is I *
actually haven’t been able reach *
Margot for a little bit. I’m pretty

sure her phone is dead. But just *
wanted to talk to Isaac and see if-- *

ISAAC'S MOM (V.O.)
--Well, it’s gotta be more of a
reception problem, right?

DAVID
Why do you say that?
29.

ISAAC'S MOM (V.O.)
If they’re all in the mountains.

DAVID
Right. Sorry, what mountains?

ISAAC'S MOM (V.O.)
The overnight trip. Camping? Isaac
is camping with his friends?

(off David's silence)
Margot was definitely invited.

DAVID
She was.

ISAAC'S MOM (V.O.)
I’m pretty positive she’s there,
too. Did she not tell you?

DAVID
Uh...
(lying)
You know what? She did. Looking at
her texts now. Ah. She just didn’t
mention “mountains.” That’s why.

ISAAC'S MOM (V.O.)
Yeah. They've been planning this
for awhile, I can’t imagine she--

DAVID
--Do you know when they all left?
Reason I’m calling is school has
her marked as absent today and--

ISAAC'S MOM (V.O.)
--Did they all ditch school? I'1l
tell you something, if that’s what
they did, Isaac is in big trouble.

DAVID
Yeah. That's... definitely what it
looks like, huh? Kids.

ISAAC'S MOM (V.O.)
Tell you what. They’re planning on
heading back tomorrow morning
anyway. Once they get reception,
I’ll let Isaac know to have Margot
give you a call.

DAVID
Perfect. That sounds perfect.
30.

ISAAC'S MOM (V.O.)
Is everything okay with you two?

DAVID
What do you mean?

ISAAC'S MOM (V.O.)
Well, I haven’t talked to you since
Pam's...

A visibly relieved David laughs off the question and-

DAVID
Oh yeah! No. Everything is great!
Margot and I are great!

SMASH TO:

ARE YOU F******KING KIDDING ME
Then we WIDEN to reveal, David’s typing on his-
IMESSAGE
He’s in the middle of a composing a long, angry text to
Margot. He airs all of his grievances - skipping school,
cancelling piano, stealing money (“?/?"), not communicating
about the overnight trip, avoiding trash errands - before
sarcastically telling Margot to enjoy the rest of her trip
because he’s going to kill her when she gets home in the AM.
But rather than hastily sending the message-

David doesn’t hit send. Instead, he slowly HIGHLIGHTS the
entire rant and deletes it. In its place, he types:

Spoke to Isaac’s mom.

Call when you get reception.
SEND.

We can feel David’s relief as he CLOSES the iMessage window
(where we also glimpse David’s most recent text to Peter:
“she's grounded all summer") and-
Pink Rev. (11/04/16) 31.

FADE TO BLACK.
SCREENSAVER - THE NEXT MORNING
A screen-saver cycles on numbing repeat. Over and over until-

A PHONE RING PIERCES THE SILENCE as a notification slides
onto the screen, waking the computer.

An unknown number calls. But this time, David answers it.

DAVID (V.O.)
Hello?

ISAAC (V.O.)
Hey Mr. Kim? This is Isaac. My mom
told me to--

DAVID (V.O.)

--Yes. Hi Isaac. Sorry to have you
call me so early. I was trying to--

ISAAC (V.O.)
--It’s okay. Just wanted to say I’m
sorry I couldn’t be of more help.

DAVID (V.O.)
What do you mean?

ISAAC (V.O.)
Wait. Did my mom not tell you?

DAVID (V.O.)
Your mom said Margot was with you.
She said you invited her to the
mountains.

ISAAC (V.0.)
--Oh. Yeah. Well, I did.

DAVID (V.O.)
Then can you please put my daughter
on the phone?
Pink Rev. (11/04/16) 32.

ISAAC (V.O.)
...She never came.

DAVID (V.O.)
What? What does that mean?

ISAAC (V.O.)
I mean, she never came. I even
reached out to her after school
Friday when we were all heading out
and my car still had an extra seat.

DAVID (V.O.)
And what did she say?

STATIC. Beat.

ISAAC (V.O.)
She didn’t respond.

Isaac’s last words reverberate until--
911 OPERATOR (V.O.)
--SVPD, Missing Persons Unit. How
can I help you?

GOOGLE - GOOGLE CHROME - 1 HOUR LATER

David googles “san jose missing person," scrolls down a list
of results, and clicks on “National Missing Persons Database.”

NMPD WEBSITE - GOOGLE CHROME
On the site, David notices a “State Case Breakdown."
DAVID (V.O.)
I’m calling about a possible-- I'd

like to report a missing person.

911 OPERATOR (V.O.)
Okay. And who is this regarding?

DAVID (V.O.)
My daughter.

911 OPERATOR (V.O.)
When was the last time you heard
from her?
22

Pink Rev. (11/04/16) 33.

DAVID (V.O.)
She called me. 30, 31... uh... 36
hours ago.

He SELECTS “California” from the drop-down listing and
scrolls to the statistic:

911 OPERATOR (V.O.)
All right. The first thing we'll
need to do is file a report. After
that, I‘1l put out a call toa
detective in the area, who'll be in

Of the 2,095 missing persons cases in California, more than
half are still open.

DAVID (V.O.)
Okay.

911 OPERATOR (V.O.)
Let’s start with her name.

DAVID (V.O.)
Margot Kim. M-A-R-G-O-T...

Suddenly, RING. Unknown number. Below the notification, we
reveal the open FaceTime video display where-

DAVID
Hello?

VICK (V.O.)
Am I speaking to David Kim?

DAVID
Yeah. And who are you? I’m assuming--

VICK (V.O.)
--My name is Detective Sergeant
Rosemary Vick. I’m the lead
investigator assigned to locating
your daughter. Good morning.

DAVID
Okay. Yeah, good morning. I’ve been
waiting for your call.

Pink Rev. (11/04/16) 34.

VICK (V.O.)
I understand this is a sensitive
issue, Mr. Kim. I’m currently 35
minutes away from your house. But
while I’m en route, I’d like for
you start telling me what you know.

DAVID
What I know? I just listed every
detail about my daughter to whoever
I got off the phone with an hour
ago. What are you guys even--

VICK (V.O.)
--Margot Pamela Kim. 16. 5, 5. 98
pounds. Registered to a 1998 green
Toyota Camry. Minor scar on her
left arm from a fracture 7 years
ago. Yeah, I got it.

DAVID
(beat)
Right. I’m sorry. I just—-

VICK (V.O.)
I’m not looking for her breakdown,

Mr. Kim. What I want to know is how
everything unfolded. From your eyes.

DAVID
Understood. Detective.

VICK (V.O.)

And in the interest of time, I'd

like it if you started right now.
DESKTOP - LATER
15 minutes later (indicated by the length of the call),
David's desktop is littered with open windows: facts on
missing children, testimonials on runaways, and posts on
Yahoo Answers. David, however, focuses his attention on-

DAVID
Yes.

Article after article after article, it becomes clear to
David that Vick knows what she’s doing.

Still on the phone call, David OPENS his-

He SELECTS the chain with Margot and starts to scroll up as-
VICK (V.O.)
Does Margot keep any smart devices
in the house? Old iPads, iPhones,
tablets?

Suddenly, David stops scrolling. He finds it: the kitchen
photo from yesterday.
Pink Rev. (11/04/16) 37.
DAVID
Yeah. She does.
David OPENS the photo in full screen as-

VICK (V.O.)
What does she have?

David PINCHES INTO the image until we finally see it, too.
Right at the corner of the frame...

DAVID
..-Her laptop. She left her laptop
at home yesterday.
Beat.

VICK (V.0.)
Okay. Let’s start with that.

DESKTOP - MARGOT’S LAPTOP

A wallpaper of Pam and Margot at the piano loads first. Then
comes the dock. All quiet on the digital front. Until-

DING. DING. DING.

Old text notifications bombard MARGOT’S LAPTOP as they catch
up to the present (“where are you?” “still have an open seat”
“called 15 times"). DING after DING until finally-

David SLIDES OPEN the Notifications Panel and activates “Do
Not Disturb,” MUTING the notifications.

The cursor moves down to the dock: 37 missed calls. 68 texts.
David ignores them, OPENS Google Chrome and TRAVELS to-

FACEBOOK - GOOGLE CHROME

-only to learn that Margot’s account isn’t logged in.

David places his cursor on the password prompt, and starts to
guess. AANK. Incorrect. Then he types another. AANK. And
another. AANK. Another. AANK. AANK. AANK.

Then David notices Margot’s-

His cursor glides over the wallpaper of Margot and Pam and-

FACEBOOK - GOOGLE CHROME

David slowly types a three-letter word into the prompt...

AANK.

Shit. David’s cursor meanders as he thinks. Thinks. Thinks.
And then suddenly-

Idea.

David SELECTS “Forgot Account," sends a password reset option
to Margot’s email address, and quickly NAVIGATES to Margot’s-—

GMAIL - GOOGLE CHROME
-where lo and behold: Margot’s Gmail isn’t logged in either.

David SELECTS “Forgot Password” and is asked to type in the
most recent password he does remember.

He carefully enters a new word and... AANK. David SLAMS on
“Try a different recovery method." On the next screen, David
is prompted to send a reset code via text.

David thinks, HITS “yes” and OPENS Margot’s-

IMESSAGE

Apart from himself (“Dad”) and Peter (“Uncle Peter”), the
rest of the names aren’t recognizable. But then, DING.

A new text pops up. It’s a reset code. David COPIES it-
GMAIL - GOOGLE CHROME
-and PASTES it back onto the Gmail prompt.

He changes Margot’s Google password and enters her inbox: 3
unread emails, including one from Facebook.

He OPENS it, CLICKS on a link and-

FACEBOOK - GOOGLE CHROME

David resets Margot’s Facebook password.

But just before he finishes, a pop-up appears: “Are you sure
you want to proceed?" Hesitating, David hovers his cursor
over both the “Yes” and “No” options before finally-

“Yes.”

David searches Margot's local files, scours through folders

Honestly, idk. We’re not really

using her?
ABIGAIL
Of course not! I feel like we all
help each other intellectually.
DAVID
You were in her class, though. Did
she ever mention anything weird? Do
something that didn’t make sense.
She looks up. Thinks. And-

Y'know, she did go on Tumblr a lot.

David scrolls through Margot's transaction history until he
locates the $2,500 transaction he was looking for.

DAVID (V.O.)
There is it is. Twenty-five hundred

A user live-casts him or herself and then verbally responds
to the live stream of typed comments and questions from

his webcam and suddenly-

immediately leaves. After a few moments of zero viewers-—

David is prompted to stop recording. He does. But only then-

toolbar. David DRAGS his cursor to the folder... and CLICK.

David's cursor hovers over the first one, CLICKS it, and
Margot’s first YouCast broadcast begins to PLAY:

A hand FIDDLES with the WEBCAM and then pulls away. We’re
looking at Margot, who’s not really sure what she’s doing.

There’s something very different about her. Something sad.

Stumbling through her first live-cast, Margot waits nervously
for a visitor. Any visitor. No one comes. Then-

David skips a minute ahead in the video and suddenly-

A new visitor appears in the chat-box and-
XxX5753: Boobies plz

weeks telling people he was my son
and that he was raising money for a
fictional police charity called
‘Moms and Dads in Blue.’

Pink Rev. (11/04/16) 86.

And as we begin to hear a TEA KETTLE WHISTLE GROW LOUDER AND
LOUDER, David gets out of the car, walks inside, and we-

SMASH TO:

INT. PETER’S LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER (HIDDEN CAMERAS) 118

David and Peter, seated uncomfortably in the living room. A
TV plays in the BG. The brothers sip their tea until-

PETER
Mm, how’s the Detective? She
working on any new leads?

DAVID
No. She’s not.

(Note: For the duration of the scene, we will INTERCUT all
three hidden CAMERA FEEDS. )

David looks over at the TV. Then starts to chuckle.

PETER
What?

DAVID

You remember that time - I think it
was like 6th grade - Eomma caught
us watching Magnum PI. She banned
us from TV for the whole summer
because I introduced you to
“graphic content!” Magnum PI.

(beat)
That was the worst feeling in the
world.

David turns off the TV.
DAVID (CONT'D)
What’s your relationship like with
Margot?

PETER
What do you mean?

DAVID
You guys hung out, right?

PETER
Sure.

David nods, prodding Peter to continue.

PETER (CONT'D)
It was - you know - we didn’t hang
out much, but I mean, she’s
obviously an amazing--

DAVID
--When was the last time you saw
her, by the way?
Beat.
PETER
You know what, I’d have to think
about that, it’s really been awhi--
David's PHONE RINGS. Peter quickly stands up.
PETER (CONT'D)
(re: tea)
I think this needs some honey.
Meanwhile we WIDEN to see David’s-
DESKTOP

The “incoming call” notification is from Detective Vick.

INTERCUT DESKTOP AND HIDDEN CAMERA FEEDS 119

David looks at his phone, debating whether to answer it as it
continues to RING and then...

IGNORE.

PETER
(from the kitchen)
Who was that?

DAVID
Work.

PETER
Oh yeah, what have they been saying
to you this whole ti--

DAVID
--Going back to the previous
question, when did you say you last
saw her?

Beat. Peter stops. Thinks.
Pink Rev. (11/04/16) 88.

PETER
Dude, I can barely remember.

He's hiding something.

PETER (CONT'D)
But let’s get our minds off this
for a sec, huh? I feel like we’re
just gonna drive ourselves crazy
talking about it. Is your tea okay?
You still want that coffee?

David puts down his tea, unable to contain his emotions.

DAVID
Last night was fun.

PETER
What was that?

David gets up and starts to walks to the kitchen.

DAVID
I feel so weird doing this.

As Peter begins to understand what David’s saying, so do we:
David is reciting the texts between Peter and Margot.

DAVID (CONT'D)
I mean, technically, it'll be legal
soon. Never tell your Dad. You free
tonight? Yesterday was crazy. What
about tonight? David will kill me
if he ever finds out. Seriously
he'd murder me.

Peter’s frozen. David arrives at the kitchen.
DAVID (CONT'D)

And then, at 4:56 PM, the night she
disappeared: See you tonight.

(pleading)
Peter? What did you do with my
daughter?
Beat.
PETER
I can explain--
WHAM.

David SLAMS Peter to the ground and starts to BEAT him.
89.
PETER (CONT'D)
David! Stop!

DAVID
What have you done to her?!

PETER
Please!

Peter flails under David's weight. David keeps HITTING and-

DAVID
What did you do to her?!

David CLAMPS Peter’s throat.

PETER
Stop! Stop!

Peter tries to yank David’s hands away but David TIGHTENS.

DAVID
WHAT WERE YOU DOING WITH HER?

Peter can barely speak, and David doesn’t relent. Peter’s
face goes white, until finally, he’s able to get a word out.

PETER
--Weed.

Beat. David loosens his hands.

DAVID
What?

PETER
(coughing)
Weed. I was smoking her out.

Suddenly, a text notification slides onto the screen. It’s
from Detective Vick: “Call back." “Urgent.” But meanwhile-

David climbs off Peter. He walks into the living room. Sits.
Catches his breath. And then-

PETER (CONT'D)
David?

DAVID
--Since when?

PETER
When you all came over for New
Year's, she found my piece.
(MORE )
Blue Rev. (11/01/16) 90.

PETER (CONT'D)

She wanted to try. And then it just
kept happening.

Peter stands and looks at a mirror: his neck is viciously
bruised. Meanwhile-

Another text from Vick goes ignored: “WE GOT HIM." “Call me.”

DAVID
--You gave drugs to my daughter?

PETER
I promised her I’d never tell you.

Peter reaches into his fridge, fumbling for an ice pack as-

DAVID
So Margot would come to you in the
middle of the night, you'd give her
weed, and do God-knows-what-else--

PETER
--That’s it. We’d get high and
talk. I swear.

Another CALL from Detective Vick. David SILENCES it as-

PETER (CONT'D)
I know how wrong this all sounds.
And I know I should’ve told you
sooner. But it just didn’t have
anything to do with... this.

DAVID
What kind of family are you?

Peter freezes.

PETER
You're asking me? You come in here
and accuse me of something un-
fucking-speakable and you're
wondering what kind of family I am?

Peter enters the living room.

Beat.

PETER (CONT'D)
You wanna know why she hated those
piano lessons? The ones she stopped
going to. It’s because every time
she'd walk in and see that thing,
she’d think about her mother.
Pink Rev. (11/04/16) 91.

DAVID
She told you that?
PETER DAVID (CONT'D)
Like I said, we talked. She told my waste-of-a-life

brother that and not me. Why?

PETER

Because you never asked. That’s the
point, dude. You didn’t even know
her. Ever since Pam, you’ve just
been so caught up in your charade
of pretending everything was okay
when everything was clearly not
that you stopped talking to Margot
about the only thing that’s been on
her mind for the last two years.

DAVID
--I lost someone too, okay?

PETER
She needed you to talk to her, not
the other way around!

DAVID
--I lost someone, too!

SILENCE.

PETER
I know.

Peter sits down across a pensive David, who doesn’t say
anything for what seems like an eternity until finally-

DAVID
I just thought it’d fix itself.

-DING. “NEW VOICEMAIL (1)"
Shaken from his daze, David grabs his cell phone, keys, and-

DAVID (CONT'D)
Thanks for the tea.

He puts the phone to his ear and leaves Peter’s apartment.
But then, halfway through Vick’s voicemail and almost at his
car (as seen through the same living room window from

earlier), David stops dead in his tracks...

.+-and crumbles to the pavement, just having heard the worst
call any parent could get.

A “BREAKING NEWS” GRAPHIC FLASHES ACROSS THE SCREEN to ACTION
MUSIC as we CUT TO an educated female anchor and-

FAUSTINE REA
Good morning, I'm Faustine Rea. A
parent’s worst nightmare comes true
this morning for David Kim. Ina
shocking and thoroughly-mind-
boggling conclusion to a story
that’s captivated the Bay Area,
Margot Kim, missing now for 5 days,
has just been tragically declared
dead. Why? A taped confession.

A picture appears to the right of the anchor. On it, a
depraved-looking man.

FAUSTINE REA (CONT’D)
Randy Cartoff, released just six
years ago for armed robbery and
felony drug possession, uploaded
the confession online before taking
his own life. We’re going to play a
segment of the 3-minute video now,
but please be warned: the following
contains graphic descriptions and
disturbing content. Viewer
discretion is advised.

INT. DINGY LIVING ROOM 121

RANDY CARTOFF (50's) - feral, pockmarked, out of his mind -
stares STRAIGHT INTO THE CAMERA. Then he looks down at the
crumbled piece of paper in his hands and reads from it.

RANDY

Dear girl in the green car, I’m
sorry for what I did to you. I’m
sorry for not listening to you when
you begged me to stop. She was
really hurt, wasn't she?

(beat)
I'm sorry for cutting you, putting
you in your suitcases, and hiding
you so no one would ever find you.
I thought this would be easy. But
it isn’t. But it isn’t...

Detective Vick speaks at a large press conference.

VICK
After analyzing the video online,
we were able to track down the
confessor’s identity. When we
arrived at his Morgan Hill
residence, Mr. Cartoff was
deceased, seemingly by a self-
inflicted gun wound. Sometimes
these confessions are hoaxes, but
based on his story, we were able to
return to the lake site where we
discovered trace DNA matching that
of Mr. Cartoff in critical areas of
the search zone. I have already
spoken to her father, but at this
point in the investigation, we are

very confident... that Ms. Kim’s
life was taken, on her way out of
town.

searching for something as-

DAVID (V.O.)
My name is David Kim, I’m trying to
reach Detective Rosemary Vick--

911 OPERATOR (V.O.)
--Oh, Mr. Kim. I am so sorry to
hear about Margot. We are so torn
up about it here.

DAVID (V.O.)
Thank you but--

David is down to the last two articles and-

911 OPERATOR (V.O.)
--Especially Rosemary. I have never
seen someone so invested in a case.
From the moment she volunteered to
lead it, to the way she handled the
investigation and dealt with the
media the way she did--

DAVID (V.0.)
--Wait.

David stops at an article when-

DAVID (V.O.)
What do you mean, volunteered?

Above the article, a familiar photo. In it, Vick poses with a
group of ex-convicts at a construction site.

You said Detective Vick

“volunteered” to lead my case. I
thought she was assigned to it.

No. She definitely volunteered.

David PUNCHES INTO the photo. But instead of focusing on
Vick, he ZOOMS to the eerily familiar ex-convict next to her.

911 OPERATOR (V.O.)
Unfortunately though, I still can’t
patch you through dispatch. She’s
probably on her way to Margot’s
memorial service, though. If you’d
like, I can connect you to her

And then we recognize him: Randy Cartoff, the man who killed

Scattered throughout the pews, Isaac, Abby, Mr. Lee, and a

Blue Rev. (11/01/16) 101.
At the front, Peter holds a spot for David, who’s noticeably
missing. And off to the side-
Vick. Her face is impossible to read. Then suddenly-
David arrives.

Respectfully acknowledging the crowd, the father proceeds
down the aisle as if heading to his pew at the front.

But then, he stops. Right in the middle.

Turns. His eyes searching, searching until-

He spots Vick. Then David doesn’t peel his eyes away.

And neither does she. Vick knows.

Now David walks faster. But instead of sitting at his pew or
pausing at the memorial, he bee-lines to Vick, halts inches
away from her face, and confronts her in a tense silence.

Will Vick run? Will she confess? Attack David?

Suddenly, entering from the side and front doors, five Silicon
Valley Police Department officers make their way to the scene.

Vick sees them. But still, she remains motionless, frozen in
David's glare until-

The officers arrive, and Vick, instead of putting up a fight,
calmly offers her hands in surrender.

The mourners watch in shock as Vick is whisked out of the
church by the officers.

And David follows them.

She was a good kid.
Pink Rev. (11/04/16) 107.

HOMICIDE AGENT
And that was the cash he was
returning.

VICK
He had to come clean. It was over.

HOMICIDE AGENT
Why didn’t he just give it to her
at school?

VICK
She could've reacted the wrong way.
In public. Marvin doesn’t like that
kind of attention--

HOMICIDE AGENT
--So he followed her.

TRAFFIC CAMERA FEEDS

Alone in her green Toyota, Margot takes the exit for the 152
East in Gilroy, California, captured on camera.

But one thing none of us noticed the first time:

VICK (V.O.)
He followed her.

In the car directly behind Margot, a stone-faced Marvin.

140 INT. INTERROGATION ROOM (TAPED INTERVIEW) 140

HOMICIDE AGENT
And what was Margot doing when your
son arrived at the lake.

VICK
She was getting high, in her car.

HOMICIDE AGENT
And what happened then?

VICK
He got inside.

HOMICIDE AGENT
What was Margot’s reaction?
Pink Rev. (11/04/16) 108.

VICK
She screamed. She hit him. By the
time Marvin noticed he was
bleeding, she was already running
and dialing for help. Marvin chased
after. But it was pitch black.

HOMICIDE AGENT
Where did he catch up with her?

VICK
A few hundred yards west of the
lake.

HOMICIDE AGENT
By the ravine.

VICK
She was punching. Yelling. Marvin
just reacted. He pushed back once
and... she fell. Just disappeared.
And then it was quiet.

HOMICIDE AGENT
(beat)
So then your son calls, asks for
your help to cover up a murder--

VICK
--No. It was my decision.

IPHONE UI - VICK’S PHONE
The original call. Vick tries to calm Marvin down.
VICK (V.O.)
Baby? Baby? I need you to take
those breaths we talked about, okay?

I don’t want you calling anyone.
Mom will be there in a second.

141 EXT. VICK’S HOUSE - DAY (NEWS FOOTAGE) 141

On CNN, we see police escort a stone-faced Marvin from his
house into a police vehicle while-

VICK (V.O.)
It was my decision. Not his.
Pink Rev. (11/04/16) 109.

142 INT. INTERROGATION ROOM (TAPED INTERVIEW) 142

HOMICIDE AGENT
So now you’re looking down this
ravine. Could you see Margot’s body?

VICK
No.

HOMICIDE AGENT
Did you go down?

VICK
I tried. But it was narrow, jagged,
and at least 50 feet to rock
bottom. Impossible without SAR.

HOMICIDE AGENT
Then how did you figure--

VICK
--She was dead? It was narrow,
jagged, and at least 50 feet to
rock bottom. And it was dead quiet.

HOMICIDE AGENT
So you helped your son.

VICK
I put her phone in the car and
dumped the car in the lake.

HOMICIDE AGENT
And the cash?

VICK
Nothing could trace back to him.

HOMICIDE AGENT
Then what?

VICK
Then I thought about my options. A
police investigation was
inevitable.

HOMICIDE AGENT
So you decided to head it.

VICK
I needed to convince David his
daughter ran away.

PHOTOSHOP - VICK’S COMPUTER 143

We see Vick’s cursor upload a California driver’s license
belonging to Rachel Jeun to Photoshop, and replace the
picture with one of Margot’s.

Then she changes the address.

VICK (V.O.)
I photoshopped an ID...

VENMO - MOZILLA FIREFOX
CLICK. Marvin’s Venmo Account is “DEACTIVATED.”

VICK (V.O.)
...told David that Marvin’s Venmo
belonged to Margot and that Marvin's
account on YouCast belonged to a
girl who didn’t actually exist.

HOMICIDE AGENT (V.O.)
But David found the car.

VICK (V.0O.)
I scrambled. First I delayed the
laptop from getting to forensics.

HOMICIDE AGENT (V.O.)
Then?

A FAMILIAR PRESS CONFERENCE

Vick points to a map of the search area, telling reporters
that the area west of the lake had already been cleared.

VICK (V.O.)
I told the law enforcement team
that we'd already cleared the zone
I knew her body was in and then told
the volunteers to look elsewhere.

Blue Rev. (11/01/16) lll.

VICK
That's why I needed a confession.
It was the only thing I could do to
stop it.
HOMICIDE AGENT
Okay. Let’s talk about Randy
Cartoff.
SILICON VALLEY HERALD NEWS WEBSITE
We see the newspaper photo of Vick and Randy, smiling. Then-
RANDY’S CONFESSION VIDEO
-starts to play. Meanwhile-
HOMICIDE AGENT (V.O.)
So you drugged up a “bum” you knew
and fed him lines?
RANDY
(looking off-camera)
She was really hurt, wasn’t she?
VICK (V.O.)
He was the only one without a
family.

HOMICIDE AGENT (V.O.)
What did you do with the video?

LIVELEAK - GOOGLE CHROME
The video is uploaded to LiveLeak.
VICK (V.O.)
I uploaded it. And planted his DNA
near the lake.
INT. INTERROGATION ROOM (TAPED INTERVIEW) 145

HOMICIDE AGENT
Was it really a suicide?

Vick doesn’t answer.

HOMICIDE AGENT (CONT'D)
He was murdered, wasn’t he?

Silence.

Blue Rev. (11/01/16) 112.

HOMICIDE AGENT (CONT'D)
Did you kill Randy Cartoff?

Vick breaks down.

VICK
He’s my son. He made a mistake.

We STAY ON Vick for awhile. Until finally-

I/E. SAN JOSE STREETS - BACK TO PRESENT (NEWS FOOTAGE) 146

An AERIAL SHOT FOLLOWS the SUV that carries Vick and David
from the church. On the lower-third: “REPORT: LEAD DETECTIVE
IN ABDUCTED/MURDERED TEEN'S CASE ARRESTED."

NEWSCASTER 3 (V.O.)
For those of you just joining from
our affiliates in Sacramento, San
Francisco and Los Angeles, we are
now tracking an SUV carrying...

The car (and its procession) continue as-

HOMICIDE AGENT (V.O.)
And on the way to the station, when
you told all this to David, what
did he do?

VICK (V.0O.)
He asked a question.

HOMICIDE AGENT (V.O.)
What did he ask?

The SUV turns a signal on and begins to switch lanes as-
CNN ANCHOR (V.O.)
In just a few seconds, the SUV will
arrive at the police station where--
VICK (V.O.)
--He asked if I was sure Margot was
dead.

HOMICIDE AGENT (V.O.)
And what did you say?

The SUV approaches a fork-in-the-road and-
147

Blue Rev. (11/01/16) 113.

VICK (V.O.)
I said even if she survived that
fall, she would have had to live 5
days without food or water.

HOMICIDE AGENT (V.O.)
And how did David respond?

The SUV makes a right turn as-—

VICK (V.O.)
He corrected me. He said 2 days.
Margot would have had to live
without food or water for 2 days.
(beat)
There was a storm on Monday.

Suddenly-

TIRES SCREECH and SIRENS BLARE as THE SUV CRANKS A U-TURN IN
THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET...

...and SPEEDS OFF in the opposite direction.

EXT. RAVINE - SANTA CRUZ MOUNTAINS - DAY (NEWS FOOTAGE) 147
We’re back in the Santa Cruz Mountains, where-
The rescue mission is underway.

From San Jose to New York, live footage of the operation
(captured by aerial and ground cameras) is streamed on
networks across the nation. In the footage-

A Search-and-Rescue helicopter HOVERS over a deep RAVINE.
Text over the image: “Santa Cruz Mountains, 5:06 PM PST.”

CNN ANCHOR (V.O.)
We are currently watching a rescue
operation underway for missing teen
Margot Kim, who authorities now
believe is at the bottom of this
Northern California ravine.

Above the ravine, police officers, fire marshals, and a hyper-
anxious David Kim watch as-

A RESCUE RESPONDER descends from the edge of the ravine and
disappears into the abyss below.

A News Anchor speaks into the CAMERA. To his left, an OTS
graphic with the text: “SEARCH BECOMES RESCUE."

NEWS ANCHOR 4
Presumed dead only hours ago, the
search for Margot Kim is
revitalized this evening after a
suspect in custody has provided
authorities with Ms. Kim’s exact
location. The only question that
remains, however: is Margot still
alive... or is it already too late?

149 EXT. RAVINE - SANTA CRUZ MOUNTAINS - DAY (NEWS FOOTAGE) 149
David can barely contain his emotions while-

NEWS PUNDITS (V.O.)

I mean, is there even a chance she
survives after all this time? /
Even if she were to make it out of
this, what kind of injuries are we
looking at?

Suddenly, the Responder’s rope begins to raise as-

150 EXT. RAVINE/INT. NEWS STATION 6 - SPLIT SCREEN - CONTINUOUSO

A DOCTOR is interviewed via split-screen, on CNN. Text below
ID's him as “Dr. Angel Palacios, Silicon Valley Trauma."

DOCTOR
Assuming Margot is still alive, and
I pray that she is, we are
realistically looking... at broken
legs, a sprained or broken neck,
injuries to the spinal cord, severe
blood clots from immobility, heavy
bruising, hypothermia, dehydration,
and that’s not even mentioning the
mental damage: shock, trauma--

CNN ANCHOR (V.O.)
--Hold on guys. It looks like
something is happening.

The split-screen disappears and back on the live rescue-

EXT. RAVINE - SANTA CRUZ MOUNTAINS - CONTINUOUS 151

David and a team of EMTs huddle as shapes begin to emerge
from ravine below. Inch by inch by inch until-

CNN ANCHOR (V.O.)
Oh my god. There she is.

Strapped to a rescue basket, bruised and broken, covered in
dirt and blood and grime and placed on the forest floor...

.+.is Margot Kim.

The EMTs immediately surround the unresponsive Margot,
checking vitals and slowly transporting her body onto a
stretcher when David pushes through the group.

Even from the HIGH ANGLE, we clearly track his emotions...

David gently CARESSES his daughter’s body, KISSING her and
WHISPERING into her ear for what seems like an eternity when-

Margot RAISES her hand to David's face. David doesn’t notice.
Until she TOUCHES him.

Smiling through his tears and crying through his laughter,
David GRIPS his daughter’s hand and steps aside...

EMTs carry a barely-alive Margot to a waiting ambulance as we-
FADE OUT.

Margot drags her cursor to the texts while David bubbles. Then-

I know Mom would be, too

David bubbles for a beat. And then-

Yeah.
It totally is.
I'll make muddy buddies.
See you tonight.
See you tonight.

Margot CLICKS on the Apple logo at the top-left of the
screen. She presses “Shut Down” and is about to confirm the
selection on “Are you sure you want to shut down?" when-

She stops. Then CANCELS the shut-down.
Margot scrolls up her text chain with “Dad” and finds a

photo. She RIGHT-CLICKS, scrolls past a series of options,
and settles on: “Set Desktop Picture." CLICK. And then-

Every app quits. The dock vanishes. And our cursor disappears.
