INT. BANQUET ROOM - “W” HOTEL - WESTWOOD - NIGHT

1

A raucous wedding reception. It’s after dinner, after
midnight, after all sense of decorum. If there’s a real
videographer here, we don’t see him: OUR POV, bouncy and
raw, is through the lens of different video-cams around the
party. We FEATURE...
A table of her friends, sorority sisters, wiping armpits with
napkins, trying to cool down before hitting the dance floor
again. Unaware of OUR VIDEO CAMERA:
BRIDESMAID #1
...it was all me. I was there at the
Black Eyed Peas concert...I made the
intros...I got them hooked up...I
told Cliff he couldn’t play games
with an Alpha Phi girl when he was
seeing that other little slut. And
then when he was going to propose?
Finally? He practiced on me to get
it right.

*

BRIDESMAID #2
So you gonna fuck him tonight, Rita?
Scandalous laughter.
BRIDESMAID #1
(recovering with a joke)
I already did.
More laughter -- until “Rita” spots OUR CAMERA.
BRIDESMAID #1
You gimme that thing. Right.

Now.
GLITCH TO:

A scrum of his friends, film freaks, all hoisting Handycams
and Coronas.
GROOMSMAN #1
(unaware of CAMERA)
“Puppet show?” She did a puppet show
after I left?
CAMERAMAN (O.S.)
Hey! What’s the good word for Cliff
and Cydney?
The guys orient to CAMERA.

BEST MAN
First the big studio sale, now the
big wedding. M.V.P. year for our boy
Clifford....
GROOMSMAN #2
I fuckin’ hate you, Anderson!
GROOMSMAN #3
When you’re all famous, don’t forget
your posse from film class. Boys in
the ‘Wood Hood.
BEST MAN
You dance with who brung ya, Cliff,
you dance with who brung ya....
GROOMSMAN #1
(still not to CAMERA)
It’s bullshit, right? Puppets just
can’t pop out of a body like that.
You guys’re just makin’ shit up ‘cuz
I split the party early....

The girls leap and scramble.

The BAND PLAYS Gary Hoey’s “Money.” Background, we see the
bride, CYDNEY, wearing pinned-on greenbacks. Foreground, a
CHEAP MAN has his buck all ready to go.

CHEAP MAN
It’s called “a dollar dance.”
CHEAP MAN’S WIFE
In 1967, it was a “dollar dance.”
Try a fifty.
As they wrangle over denominations, Cydney changes dance
partners in the background. A BEAR OF A MAN wraps her up.
GLITCH TO:
E1

The CROWD ROARS approval: Cydney just pushed cake into her
husband’s face. Sputtering, CLIFF takes off his glasses and
looks around. All we see are two eyes and a mouth.

He’s

G1

FATHER OF GROOM
Now I am still transporting Cliff and
Cydney to the airport, correct?
First thing in the morning?
MOTHER OF GROOM
That changed. We’re picking them up
after the honeymoon.
FATHER OF GROOM
Just put it on paper, that’s all I
ask. If Cliff can write a 120-page
story for them, maybe he can write a
one-page movement-order for his
father. Where is that boy, anyway?
GLITCH TO:
H1

The bar. Cliff is put in a headlock by an aggressively drunk
TOMMY. It’s an old sibling ritual that Cliff keeps hoping
will die a natural death. It hasn’t.
TOMMY
My little brother gettin’ married
before me, huh?
CLIFF
Yeah, I wonder why.
Barkeep!

H1

*
*

C’mon, let up.

TOMMY
‘Nother brewsky here, huh?

CLIFF
Tommy, your armpit smells like ass,
okay? Will you let the fuck up?
Christ, 28 years old and he’s still
doin’ it to me....

TOMMY
Came all the way from Michigan to
do this one more time....

Tommy savagely knuckle-rubs the top of Cliff’s head.

GLITCH TO:

Pool deck. CYDNEY’S SISTER tries to hide her cigarette while
being interviewed on CAMERA. She’s with a CLUELESS HUSBAND
who pages through a guide book of Hawaii.

J1

CYDNEY’S SISTER
...well, far be it from my little
sister to do the typical honeymoon -a high-rise in Waikiki with a little
snorkel-pond? Don’t think so. Some
friends of ours did The Kalalau Trail
last year and came back with the most
amazing pictures, so -CLUELESS HUSBAND
So they’re going to Maui, right?

Sister rolls her eyes. CAM PUSHES IN on a fold-out map of
the Hawaiian islands as Husband gets corrected.

*

CYDNEY’S SISTER
“Kauai.” The last island, number
five, one-two-three-four-five, right
there. And hon, if you don’t know
what you’re sayin’, please don’t say
it on camera, ‘kay?
(back to CAMERA)
I think they just wanted to start off
their lives together with some kind
of...adventure....

VIDEO: Cliff and Cydney dash for the limo. He’s a winning
combination of looks and smarts. She’s Alpha Phi, all rose
and honey. Details beyond that are lost in a blizzard of
rice, confetti, camera flashes. With his own Handycam, Cliff
tapes the WELL-WISHERS all around them.

EXT. ROAD TO HANALEI - DAY
VIDEO: We’re SHOOTING Cliff from the POV of his own lap.
He laps a shaved ice as he drives some kind of convertible,
palm trees gliding through FRAME, everything set against an
achingly blue sky.

CYDNEY (O.S.)
I have a question for you, Mr.
Cliff Anderson of Venice Beach,
California....
CLIFF
Yes, Mrs. Cydney Anderson, formally
Miss Cydney Carswell of Pacific
Palisades, California....
CYDNEY (O.S.)
How’d you get the little scar?
Her finger enters FRAME, touching under his chin.
CYDNEY (O.S./CONT’D)
Can’t believe I just found it.
CLIFF
Long story. Involves Homeland
Security and me being unexpectedly
pressed into service as a deputy air
marshal. I don’t talk about it much.
Try again.

CYDNEY (O.S.)
Less grandiose.

CLIFF
Brother hit me with his skateboard
when I was nine years old. Claims it
was an accident.
CYDNEY (O.S.)
Which brother’s this?
CLIFF
That’d be Tommy.
Michigan.

The one from

*

CYDNEY (O.S.)
Thought he said “Maryland” at the
wedding.
CLIFF
Excuse me, whose brother is this?
CYDNEY (O.S.)
Well, I saw like 16 brothers there.
Okay, “Tommy from Michigan.” A new
wife should know these things....

She steals his shaved ice, gives it a suggestively long lick.
CLIFF
Didn’t that guidebook say there
were no snakes in Hawaii?

INT./EXT. HELICOPTER COMPANY - KAUAI - DAY

Outside, we see a WHAPPING helo on the pad, head-dipped
tourists boarding. Inside, we FIND Cliff at the counter,
paying cash for an upcoming tour.
COUNTER GIRL
Now what about the extra video?
Camera’s right there in front of you,
getting all your reactions. We cut
it into scenery from the tour.
CLIFF
(patting Handycam)
Think I’ll take my own, thanks.
COUNTER GIRL
Have it ready before you leave.

CLIFF
Just the one-hour “Fly Over To Die
Over,” please. And might’nt you’ve
come up with a better name?

winds and liquid sunshine. But for
at least two young people, it seems
paradise became a very dangerous
place. Reporting from Honolulu is
our own Katie Nakamura....

That HELO REVS UP outside. Cliff joins Cydney at the window
to watch the take-off -- but CAMERA STAYS BEHIND on that TV,
where the scene changes to a field reporter at a major crime
scene. The HELO drowns out her words, but the ticker at the
bottom of the screen reads...
“Grisly Discovery At Honolulu Harbor.”

INT. HUGHES 500 HELICOPTER - DAY

We find Cliff and Cydney inside the sight-seeing chopper -the doorless chopper -- as it banks to offer up a new vista.
Cliff hangs out the starboard side to get it all on tape.
Cydney hangs onto him, not trusting the harnesses.
CYDNEY
Get back in here!
CLIFF
Never knew there were so many shades
of green! Here, get a picture of me!
Everywhere, waterfalls drop 3,000 feet.
Earth’s rivers end right here.

It’s like all the

EXT. KAUAI - AERIAL MONTAGE - DAY
The sight-seeing chopper overflys the Waimea Canyon, the
“Grand Canyon of the Pacific,” all wild and raw...
Exotic Manawaiopuna Falls, familiar from “Jurassic Park”...
A pod of whales breaching coastal waters...
And the great Napali Coast. Steep green mountains, carved
by a million years of erosion, end abruptly at the Pacific
Ocean. A hiking trail is seen twisting and turning with the
coastline.

Show you what it’s all for....
They THUNDER on toward...
Kalalau Beach, a golden crescent of sand. Mountains cordon
it off from inland areas -- and the rest of civilization.
PILOT
Most gorgeous dead-end God ever made!
CYDNEY
Forget the hike! Just drop us off
right now!
PILOT
Only two ways in and out, Cydney -on foot or by kayak. But that’s what
makes it special!
The pilot banks away. Cydney and Cliff crane necks to keep
the beach in view as long as possible.

INT. GENERAL STORE - DAY
SUPPLY GUY
Now how many days you allow?
A native SUPPLY GUY huddles with Cliff over a trail map.
Nearby, his greying EARTH MOMMA wife rings purchases -dehydrated food in pouches, iodine pills, water-camels,
mess kits, magnesium fire-starter, white gas stove.

11

Page 9.

CLIFF
One day in, one on the beach, another
day out?
SUPPLY GUY
Common mistake.
CLIFF
You think I need more?
SUPPLY GUY
I don’t know if you’ll need more,
but you’ll sure want more. But so
long as you got your permits and
they’re generally up-to-date....
CLIFF
Yeah, yeah, right here....
He keeps them inside a color brochure.
SUPPLY GUY
(checking permits)
Because the rangers do get out and
work the trail, especially after the
three-mile marker. So you want to
keep these close, Cliff.
Frowning, Cliff pulls a can off a shelf. It’s some kind of
cut-rate Spam. If such a thing is possible.
CLIFF
People will actually eat this?
“Potted Meat Product?”
EARTH MOMMA
Honey, I won’t even read the
ingredients. Comes to $427.57.
Cydney appears with a few more things -- hats, sunblock,
bandana -- adds them to the check-out pile.
CYDNEY
And these.
(snuggling up to Cliff)
Miss me?
CLIFF
(scowling at map)
Three days sounds plenty to me....
Through an unwashed window, we see a primer-grey El Camino
park outside.

*

Page 10.

CYDNEY
Nine whole minutes -- that’s the
longest we’ve been away from each
other since we got married. You
musta missed me something awful, huh?
CLIFF
(to Supply Guy)
11.5 miles, right? Each way?
CYDNEY
(in Cliff’s ear)
C’mon, just say you did. I’ll give
you a b.j. in the car...another
one....
SUPPLY GUY
But see, you’re gonna cross five
valleys, and each time you do, you’re
gonna gain or lose 1,000 feet of
elevation. That’s the killer.
CLOSE on a mechanical parrot mounted above the entrance door,
the Hawaiian equivalent of a dingle-bell. It SQUAWKS as
someone enters.
CYDNEY
(mock huffy)
Well, I missed you.
CLIFF
(teasing her)
What, did you go somewhere?
EARTH MOMMA
Make that $475.35.

*

Cliff produces a wad of cash.
CLIFF
Know it looks like I robbed a bank,
but....
CYDNEY
Our wedding haul.
Now reveal CHRONIC, the owner of the El Camino. He’s a
blonde-dreaded Rasta-punk with a beaded “CHRONIC” choker
around his neck.
(NOTE: Chronic and Earth Momma slip into local pidgin-speak.
It happens background.)
EARTH MOMMA

Honolulu, were you?

CHRONIC

Other side. Waves was junk for three
days, mo bettah here. Why, what’s
the stink in ‘Lulu?
EARTH MOMMA
(remembering customers)
Maybe nuff for now. Wanna help these
two out to their car?
CHRONIC
Shoots, yeah. Just dump my gear,
be ri’ widdem.
Chronic flashes Cliff and Cydney a grin before heading for
the rear of the store. He seems like a harmless doper.
Though he did get a look at Cliff’s wad of cash.
CLIFF
(to Earth Momma)
I think we got it. Thanks.

Finished loading, Cliff and Cydney hop back into the Jeep.
As they CRANK OVER, the Supply Guy and his wife step outside
to see them off.
SUPPLY GUY
And get an early start!
Aloha!

EARTH MOMMA

A friendly round of waves. But as Cliff backs up...
One tire uncovers that Oahu newspaper -- the one they never
saw. A photo shows two bodies covered in bloody sheets.
The headline reveals “Young Couple Butchered in Honolulu.”

CYDNEY
(singing along)
Won’t you open up your heart...
And let me in...
For you and I will never part...
That you should know, so...
I need your love for more than just
an hour...
I need your love more than just a
day...
So hold me close, my love will never
falter...
I need your love each and every day...
Na-na-na-na-na-na....
Cliff joins in on the NA-NA-NA chorus.
CYDNEY
I love our new lives.
The Jeep wheels onward, soon rounding a bend and passing...
Two hitchers, backs turned, thumbs out.
Cliff pulls over.
CYDNEY
What’re you doin’?
CLIFF
It’s Hawaii.
It’s a two-word defense unto itself. Cydney scowls at her
side mirror. There we see the two hitchers hustling closer.
Male and female, late 20s.
CYDNEY
So in Hawaii, Cliff and Cydney do
things they normally wouldn’t?
Like pick up hitch-hikers?
CLIFF
Nothing bad ever happens here, right?
HIS REARVIEW MIRROR POV: Of the hitchers. The closer
get, the dodgier they get: The girl looks like Oxnard
skank, wearing an almost-nuthin’ bandana top. The guy
dark and ripped, the kind of rip you get from steroids
prison. Or steroids in prison.
CYDNEY
That’s a hard look they got....

How far you goin’?

Lumahai...Lumahai...not sure we know
that....
CLEO
‘Bout 10 miles ahead, right on this
road. You know, right by where the
big trail starts. You know that
trail?
CLIFF
Oh, yeah, sure. That big trail....
Cliff spots a tattoo on Kale’s chest. It’s right where an
E.R. doctor might want to put his defib paddle. And it says
“DO NOT REVIVE.”
CLIFF (CONT’D)
...but we aren’t goin’ that far.
Cydney looks relieved. But Kale looks unhappy about getting
out of a ride he’s already in. Especially when that ride is
full of trail gear.
KALE
So how far do you go?
CLIFF
Just, y’know. Up the road here.
(off Kale’s stare)
So if you just hang here another five
minutes, maybe someone else comes
along who can take you all the -CLEO
We was waitin’ for, like, an hour

Shit, thought this was Hawaii.
Kale jumps out, grabs his rucksack.
C’mon.

With a desperate edge, Cleo produces photos and starts
showing them to Cydney.

CLEO
Some of these pitchers totally suck -just one of those cameras you chuck
afterwards. But this one, this one’s

KALE
These people wanna see less of us,

CLEO
That’s Kale gettin’ a new tatt....
Uh-huh....

CYDNEY

CLEO
Oh, here, here it is. That’s us
doin’ the deed on Oahu -- just woke
up one morning and decided to get
married. Pretty, isn’t it?
CYDNEY
(coming around)
Oh, yeah. It is pretty with that
whole arbor of....
(a double-take)
Is this a grocery store?
CLEO
“Paula’s Market.” They do it up real
nice for you -- put that big hoop
thing over your head with all kinds
of lettuces and pineapple parts and
stuff. Produce manager took that
pitcher. I know it sounds kinda
tacky? But it was pretty friggin’
pretty after they added all the
little radishes in there....

KALE

CLIFF
C’mon, guys. Let’s not turn this
into a bigger deal than it really -KALE
Cleo. Get the fuck out of this
man’s ride.
Cleo knows that tone of voice -- and knows to respect it.
Kale rounds the car for a private word with Cliff.
KALE
My mother, she was like this...
metaphysical gypsy Christian psychic
chick. Know the type, right?
Oh, sure.

CLIFF

KALE
I used to think she was messed up
in the head, but then sometimes...
something occurs...that makes me
think I acquired some of her gypsy
powers. Like right now. Right now
I do believe I can divine what you’re
thinking.
CLIFF
An’ what’s that?
KALE
“I hope I never run into this dire
motherfucker again.”
It’s a pretty good guess. Kale raps on the Jeep like a car
salesman seeing you off the lot.

EXT. CRAWLER’S LEDGE - THE TRAIL - DAY
The terra-cotta trail narrows. To the right is one of those

CYDNEY
Well, everyone else did it.
CLIFF
Did they really?
He leans right, checking for bodies that might be littering
the CRASHING SURF far below.
NICK (O.S.)
Show it no fear.
Coming up from behind is NICK, 32. He wears nylon jeans,
sport sandals, mil-spec Boonie hat, an engaging grin -- all
wrapped up in an air of invincibility. Make that “a flair”
of invincibility.
CYDNEY
(re trail)
Is some of it washed out, or....
NICK
Watch me. Keep your eyes down, your
speed up...avoid the green rocks...
and just...be...fearless.
Just like that, he’s across the bad patch.
CYDNEY

Made it look easy.
CLIFF
He’s not wearing an A-16 store on
his back.

In fact, all Nick carries is a butane tank and walking stick.
Now Cliff girds and goes. He’s not as slick as Nick, but he
makes it to the other side without calamity. Nick pulls him
past and now motions for...
Cydney.

Starting across.

Nick holds out his stick, offering it should she need it.
Below Cydney, WAVES BOOM ONTO ROCKS.
CLIFF
Doin’ good, Cydney, doin’ real
good....
Suddenly a TOURIST HELO ROCKETS overhead.
Cydney startles.
Her foot hits a green rock.

Pushes off.

Slips.

Cydney totters on the edge, her hand grabbing blindly for...
Nick’s stick.

Missing...missing...

And snagging it.
Nick pulls hard and straight. Suddenly Cydney is on the
other side, the safe side, reeled into Nick’s arms.
Shit.

CYDNEY
Did I almost die right there?

NICK
Not on my watch.

CLIFF
No, no, no.
NICK
Haven’t seen you on TV.
CLIFF
No such luck.
CYDNEY
Actually, Cliff’s a screenplay
writer, very sought-after. Several
of the big studios want him for their
movie projects now.
NICK
Knew I smelled fame and fortune on
you. Screenplay writer, huh?
CLIFF
(mock humble)
We say “screenwriter.”
NICK
Any movies I might know?
CLIFF
Well, my first script is actually in
pre-production right now. So ask me
again this time next year, and....
NICK
Who’s in it?
CLIFF
Still trying to figure that out.
Still casting up.

Well, Nick Cage is always money in
my book. I like how he gets all mad
RIGHT AT THE END OF THE SENTENCE!
So you got a good Act Two twist?

You, uh, in the business, Nick?
NICK
Me? Nah. Just took some course -one of those writing boot camps.
Had so many ass-puckering experiences
in life, I figure, hell, I’ll just
throw ‘em down on paper, make myself
a million bucks.
CLIFF
Not so easy, is it?
NICK
I liked it all ‘cept the paperwork -y’know, actually makin’ pages? But I
got the basics down -- three acts,
hero with a journey, red snappers.
All that stuff.
CLIFF
“Red snappers?”
NICK
You know, you bring in a character

brought on another guy to do a quick
rewrite.
NICK
On your story?
CLIFF
Just a two-week punch-up.
Yeah?

NICK
And how long ago was this?

CLIFF
Uh...nine weeks.
NICK
(shaking head)
That ain’t right. It’s your baby,
your vision, Cliff. Shouldn’t let
them get away with that.
CYDNEY
He’s got these agents, but they don’t
want to fight for him. I finally
told Cliff he just should get new -CLIFF
Hey, not that “me” isn’t my favorite
subject? But maybe we can just talk
about something else for awhile.
Jesus.
NICK
(zipping up)
I’ll just say one more thing, Cliff.
One last pearl of wisdom.
CLIFF
Get a new agent?
NICK
Get a new story.
Nick’s eyes are dancing:

He may have just the one in mind.

EXT. THE TRAIL - DAY

Stalled on the trail are THREE CORN-FED KANSAS CITY GIRLS,
late teens whose adjective-de-jour is “major.” They’re all
jabbing cell phones with frustrating results. When they spot
Cliff, Cydney, and Nick approaching...
K.C. GIRL #1
You hear about Oahu? What happened
there?
Why?

CYDNEY
What did happen?

K.C. GIRL #1
Well, my dad just called from K.C.K.?
Couldn’t hear everything, reception’s
like major shit out here, but...
he was sayin’ something about some
murders....
Suddenly everyone has a cell phone out, thumbing buttons and
wandering around for reception like dowsers searching for
water.
Flat-line.

NICK

CLIFF
In and out. Mostly out.

Was this in Honolulu?
K.C. GIRL #3
“Dad” wants us to leave. I think
he’s in major over-reaction mode,
okay?
K.C. GIRL #2
Some newlyweds got killed. Is that
right, Lori? That what he said?
CYDNEY
God, we were just there.

Girl #3, the one who wants to stay, squints raw ire at Nick.
“Thanks, asshole.”

Whaddya think?
CYDNEY
That’s Oahu, not here.
CLIFF
Speak now or forever hold your
peace....
CYDNEY
This is our honeymoon.
(to K.C. girls)
C’mon, guys, you can hike with us.
We’re going all the way to Kalalau
Beach. All the way to the end.
Hey.

K.C. GIRL #2
(a beat)
So you’re like...newlyweds.
K.C. GIRL #1
Well, that’s cool...but, uh, I think
we’re just gonna get the hell out of
Hawaii. Thanks anyway.

creeped out for them)

The K.C. girls grab packs and start back for the trail-head.
Girl #3 follows reluctantly, HARANGUING the other two as
major cowards. But soon they’re all running.

Well, they talk about it in the guide

NICK
Just for the day. Had to run back to
the truck for a little butane.
CYDNEY
How close is it?
NICK
Like everything else in Hawaii -“As close as faraway gets.”

Cliff considers the new trail. It’s steep, slippery, laced
with tree roots. Not so romantic.

About to decline, Cliff spots...
Two trekkers on a switchback far behind them. One is male,
the other female. And they look uncomfortably like....
What?

CYDNEY

She tracks his gaze, but now the two trekkers have slipped
from sight. Was it even them?
CLIFF
One mile, huh?

EXT. TRAIL TO SECRET FALLS - DAY
En route to Secret Falls, Nick and Cydney are in the lead,
chatting it up like old friends.
CYDNEY
...and all of Cliff’s family came
into town -- he’s Catholic, or at
least he began that way, so that was
kind of a happy invasion. And I’ve
got a big family, too, all really
close...and then my other sisters had
to be invited, my sorority sisters....
Kept going up and up, but I’d say we
had 300 people at the reception...
maybe more. But I’ll tell you, it was
just the most magical weekend....
Nick helps her over the rough patches, once pushing on her
ass when she threatens to fall back onto him. They laugh it
off as they PASS CAMERA. Next comes...
The unlaughing Cliff. He’s sweating like pig at a luau,
struggling with the grade and the weight on his back.
Stopping for water, he turns to check...

but hear only BIRD CALLS. No human sounds.
Satisfied he’s alone, Cliff turns back and bumps into Nick.

in like a human blade, barely rippling the surface, then
resurfaces to greet the water nymph mouth-first.

CYDNEY
Well, while you’re doin’ that....
Feeling frisky, she reaches back and plucks the strings on
her halter top. It draws a look from Cliff.
CYDNEY
“It’s Hawaii.”
The halter hits the ground. With one arm draped demurely
across her chest, Cydney moves to pool’s edge and swipes a
toe. She deliberates over her Calvin Klein’s but eases in
with them still on.

FLY CAM: Moving better without his pack, Cliff reaches the
top of the waterfall and the stream that feeds it.

He checks his phone. Same crappy signal. He waves the phone
overhead like a witch doctor shaking a talisman, checks
again. Ah, that’s better.
Cliff goes on-line. Googles “Honolulu murders.” Gets some
hits, a lot of hits. Picks the most promising one.

Cliff whirls. Even closer, Kale is dunking his head-rag in

least bit threatening, what he does. And that’s what makes
it threatening.
KALE (CONT’D)
Few people die out here every year.

Nick and Kale assess each other. They’re both formidable in
different ways: Kale is thick and savage, a street brawler
who might punch your face through the back of your skull.
Nick is lean and cocksure, a 10-and-0 middleweight who seems
willing to fight out of his class.

Out of the pool, Gina slips on a tight tee-top stencilled,
“What’re YOU Lookin’ At?” She’s shaping up as delightfully

GINA

up at the “Ocean View Hotel,” which,
come to find, actually hadn’t had an
ocean view since 1987 when all these
high-rises went up ‘cross the street.
Waikiki? Honestly, that whole place
was dancin’ on my very last nerve....
Cydney only half-listens: Those two rucksacks are familiar,
and now her eyes search the path to the upper falls. She’s
relieved when Cliff and Nick appear.
CYDNEY
Are we okay?
CLIFF
Let’s keep an eye on our time.
CYDNEY
Do those packs belong to who I think
they belong -CLIFF
Said they were gonna do the trail
all along. I don’t know, maybe they

Wanna break down that tarp, Nicko?

Department of Corrections.” And scrawled on the backside:
“Next appt -- 8/11.”

EXT. THE TRAIL - DAY
FLY CAM: A foursome now, Cliff, Cydney, Nick, Gina are back
trekking the main trail. The great Pacific, just hours ago
turquoise, has changed its mood to slate-grey. Miles out,
flat-bottomed clouds drop veils of rain.

(seeing it coming)
Well, guess you can’t have rainbows
without a little rain....

You hear that Cliff here’s a big
screenplay writer?

shit you ain’t seen in no Hollywood
movie before. Like the time -GINA
(sotto to Nick)
You watch yourself now....
What?

NICK

GINA
You know what I mean.
Gina sparks up a little Maui-Wowie.
NICK
Well, maybe Cliff here can change the
names to protect the guilty. You do
that in movies, right? ‘Cuz some of
the stuff I got here is like double
down-low.
Cliff checks the trail behind.

All clear.

GINA
Do you know Johnny Depp?
NICK
He knows Nick Cage. Can you see
him playin’ me in some movie?
CYDNEY
(to Cliff, surprised)
You know Nick Cage?
CLIFF
Guess I do now.
He slips out his phone.

No reception here.

GINA
Me myself, I like that Johnny Depp
better. He’s just dreamy.

Fuck.

Page 35.

NICK
But look, it all starts with story.
Like the time I made a surprise visit
to a certain dictator’s palace on the
Tigris River. Newly evacuated -could still smell fine Havana tobacco
hangin’ in the air. We were tasked
with finding perishable intel,
computer disks, shit like that. But
in the master bathroom -- about the
size of Ethiopia, by the way, big
golden dolphins for faucets -- there
was this lock-box bolted to the
floor. Had initials engraved on top,
his initials. We start beatin’ on
the lock -CLIFF
(orienting)
Iraq. You were in Iraq.
NICK
First in. Me and my wolf pack.
Fuck those pictures you saw about
the 4th Infantry -- that was later.
What I’m givin’ you now is God’s Real
Shit from an operator who had true
eyes-on.
GINA
(sing-songy)
He’s not supposed to talk about this
stuff....
She offers the joint to Cydney.
No, no.

CYDNEY
But you go ahead.

NICK
So inside this box, I figure maybe
cash, maybe a set of pearl-handled
pistolas, or hey, maybe some damn
fine Presidential-grade hashish. We
finally burn it open with 50-grain
det-cord. Handy tool, det-cord -you can wrap it around a tree three
feet thick and -- PHHHHT! -- drop it
across the trail when someone’s hot
on your ass. Remember that trick.
CLIFF
“Det cord.” Nice detail.

Page 36.

NICK
Well, gotta get the details right.
Otherwise, you’re just makin’ another
big crap-tastic movie. So we open up
that box and what do we find? Iron
Man. Avengers. The dude was a
Silver Age Marvel freak. And can you
believe what he had most of? In his
own personal stash?

*
*

CLIFF
I wasn’t there, Nick.
NICK
Sub-Mariner.
CLIFF
You mean like “Namor, Prince of the
Deep?”

*
*
*

NICK
All in French, some reason.

*

CLIFF
Really. So why Sub-Mariner?
that one of the shit titles?

Isn’t

NICK
One theory? Tug-job material. Mr.
Presidente had a thing for Frenchspeaking fellahs with little Speedos
and big spears. One theory.
CLIFF
So you’re Special Ops.
Rangers, what?

*

*
*
*
*

Seals,

NICK
Officially...I’m only allowed to
say that I’ve been a sworn officer
participating in the tactical phase
of certain missions that would make
most men wanna crawl up and hide
inside their own assholes.
CYDNEY
But unofficially....
NICK
I’m a Goddamn American Jedi.
Possible Title #1, by the way.
See this?

He whips off his Boonie hat and bandana beneath. There’s a
wicked scar on the back of his head where someone seemingly
tried a back-door lobotomy.
Oooh.

CYDNEY
Put it back on.

NICK
Took frag from a Bounding Betty -anti-personnel mine. Caved in back’a
my head. Medivacked out to Germany,
got my skull rebuilt with space-age
titanium. Can’t go through a metal
detector without ringing cherries.
But that’s cool, cuz, see...it lets
me travel with Gilligan just about
whenever I want.
CYDNEY
“Gilligan?”
Nick hikes up his nylon pants. A 10-inch tactical knife,
black, is strapped to one shin bone.
NICK
“My little buddy.”
Cliff stops looking over his shoulder now -- and starts
looking at Nick.
CLIFF
That’s some toothpick.
NICK
But here’s the kicker: When I took
that shrapnel? I never felt it,
Cliff. I mean, I felt impact, felt
my backside go all wet -- but no real
pain. Now maybe I don’t recall
events in full -- they did scoop out
a little Grey Spam back there -- but
they tell me, get this, my wolf pack
will swear that I was ambulatory for
more than 17 minutes before they
forced me to lie down. Tackled me.
And even then, I was lookin’ to
monkey-fuck a Marlboro Light. No
nerve endings in the brain, Cliff.
Remember that when you write the
scene.
Cliff touches eyes with Cydney.
Yeah.

CLIFF
Lotta good details there.

As those storm clouds march closer to shore.

EXT. SPILLWAY - THE TRAIL - DAY

33

Nick, Gina, Cliff, and Cydney reach a wide swath of water
flowing across the trail. TWO TIRED TREKKERS appear on the
opposite side.
Nick and Gina ford across. Cliff drops his pack and starts
adjusting straps -- but it’s really an excuse to hang back,
to get separation on...
Nick and Gina.

Meeting the trekkers halfway across.

GINA
Y’all make it to the beach?
TIRED TREKKER #1
Just keep goin’. It’s great.
Nick and Gina slosh on. Soon the trekkers are across the
spillway and with Cliff and Cydney.
CLIFF
(low)
See any rangers up ahead?
TIRED TREKKER #1
None we saw.
CYDNEY
So just another three miles to the
beach? We hope?
TIRED TREKKER #1
Yeah, but...a lot of twists and turns
ahead.
The trekkers keep going. Cliff checks on Nick and Gina.
They’re just reaching the other side.
CLIFF
Further we go, fewer people on the
trail.
CYDNEY
And your point is....

He peeks at his cell phone.

Some reception now.

CLIFF
(chin-nodding)
Over there. Pretend you need to
piss.
“Pretend?”

CYDNEY

She squats in bushes. Cliff calls up that web-page, the one
with the “DOWNLOAD NOW” button. He keys it. Line by line a
picture appears.
CLIFF
Cops in Honolulu released a photo...
‘parently killers didn’t know they
were on camera....
It’s a marginal photo to begin with -- black-and-white by
night -- and the low-rez screen doesn’t help. But two
figures are seen, male and female, dragging bodies down a
rain-slicked wharf.
Shit.

He shows her. There’s a telling moment where we HEAR HER

EXT. RAIN MONTAGE - THE TRAIL - DAY

RAIN HAMMERS down.
VARIOUS SHOTS of water cascading down the valleys, spouting
over cliffs, sweeping across the trail. It’s like the
opening salvo of some biblical flood.
35

EXT. CAMPSITE - COASTAL BLUFF - RAIN - DAY
Just off-trail is a coastal bluff with a rare bit of flat
land. A lean-to is already up, basic cover for Cydney and
Gina as they unpack and try to keep things dry.
GINA
Well, guess the beach’ll still be
there tomorrow....
The wind steals a bed-pad.

Cydney goes after it.

CYDNEY
Hope we are!
Nearby, Cliff erects a small tent. He’s trying to stomp
stakes into the ground. But soon he hears a PRECISION

Zipping up a fresh wind-breaker, Cliff exits his tent and
heads for the lean-to where...

Lot of ‘em in

CLIFF
I haven’t seen any goats.
Relaxing, Nick ducks under the lean-to, opens a bottle of
“Scorpion Mescal,” takes a slug. A scorpion floats inside,
blissful in death.
NICK
Don’t expect you would, Cliff -- your
situational awareness kinda sucks.
That’s not a knock -- you’re a
screenwriter, I’m a Jedi. Just the
different paths we chose.
He passes Cliff the Scorpion Mescal.
NICK (CONT’D)
(re scorpion)
Think they kill him first? Or he
just drown in there? Always wonder.
CLIFF
Just so I know whether to be
offended or not, define “situational
awareness.”
Nick starts assembling a bi-fold apparatus from his pack,
opening it up, dogging it down, running carbon cables through
eccentric pulleys.
NICK
What’s the first thing you do when
you step onto a plane? Maybe have a
sip of that fine champagne up there.
You do fly First Class, right?

NICK
When I board a plane -- makin’ my way
back to the cheap seats -- I clock
every door and pace off the distance
between those exits and my seat. If
the plane loses power on take-off, I
can make egress in the dark, totally
blind. If the aisle crowds up, I
know I’m climbin’ over the back of

And I know all this inside of 30

His apparatus is taking shape as a compound hunting bow.
Nick checks the string tension -- TWANG! -- and adjusts some
more like a man tuning his guitar.
NICK (CONT’D)
See, if you wait until the emergency
happens to figure out what you’re
gonna do -- you’re already dead.
An itchy silence: Taken one way, it was an engaging story
that could work its way into a screenplay. Taken another,
it’s a death sentence.

flips it to Cliff. Again.

EXT. TREE LINE NEAR CAMPSITE - RAIN - DAY
Portrait of a man in his element: Nick is on the prowl,
hunting bow at low guard, eyes on high alert. He PASSES
CAMERA, and a beat later comes...
Cliff, axe in hand. He can’t fathom how he came to be out
here in the dark...in the rain...on his honeymoon. Soon he
pauses, eyes searching. Behind him, the smeary glow of our
campsite is still visible. But where’d Nick go?
NICK (O.S.)
You know, crossed my mind...
He rolls out from behind a tree.
NICK (CONT’D)
...that it crossed your mind...that
we’re the ones. Me and Gina.
CLIFF
“The ones” who....
NICK
It’s okay, Cliff. I mean, that’s

CLIFF
We’re not really hunting goats, are
we?
No.

It hangs there a beat.
CLIFF
Then why don’t you just tell me what
the hell we are -NICK
(drawing close)
We got us a shadow -- two of ‘em.
Haven’t identified as hostile yet,
but they passed our camp once...
doubled back for a second look...
then took cover in here.

I know you didn’t see them.

This is someone else.
A spooky beat.

Should get back to camp, then.

Gina can take care of herself.
CLIFF
Thinking ‘bout Cydney.
NICK
Gina can take care of her, too.
CLIFF
(screwing up face)
Are you just so fuckin’ with me,
Nick?
NICK
If I was the killer, wouldn’t stay
on Oahu. I’d fall back to the most
remote part of the most remote
island. I’d come right here.
With that, he vanishes into the forest. Cliff takes a moment
to wipe his glasses dry. And think. And follow.

EXT. CAMPSITE - COASTAL BLUFF - RAIN - DAY
Staring out into rainy twilight:
CYDNEY
Little worried about Cliff. He’s not
really the bow-and-arrow type.
GINA

Boys are happiest when they’re
huntin’ something they can’t quite
catch. ‘Sides, gives us a little
time together.
She looks at Cydney unbrokenly as she sparks up a joint,
takes an inviting pull.

Dope was never my thing.

GINA
So what is your thing, Cydney?
We haven’t really heard yet.
CYDNEY
Probably sound boring to you.
Try me.

GINA

CYDNEY
Well, we’re working very hard at
getting pregnant. We’ll have five
kids, two boys and three girls, and
they’ll be beautiful beyond belief,
of course. We’ll live in the
Palisades near one of the bluffs,
take long summer walks and look out
at the sailboats on the ocean, all of
us, the whole big family. And I
guess I’ll just be happy to be “Mom”
and “Mrs. Cydney Anderson” for a good
long while.
GINA
“It’s Pillsbury fresh.”
Cydney cocks her head.

“What’s that supposed to mean?”

GINA (CONT’D)
Sorry. Some people get all dull when
they smoke? Me myself, I get an
edge. So why do I think there’s some
wild-child in your past?
CYDNEY
Why do you?
GINA
(indicating eyebrow)
Hmm, maybe those liddle-iddy-biddy
holes where the rings useta be.
What, three or four of ‘em?
(a beat)
Had this preacher back in Georgia.
Used to tell all the kids we’d rot in
hell for havin’ sex outside the
sanctity of marriage. Then bless his
heart, one day his wife catches him
out back of the Waffle House with
some hooker -- some hooker with a
really big dick. So now when I meet
people who wanna tell me how so damn
perfect their lives are?

She shrugs. “They usually ain’t.” Cydney rocks back and
just eyes Gina, realizing she’s smarter than she lets on.

Worst we can do is rot in hell.
And the rain keeps coming.

Cliff threads his way through dank forest. The deeper he
goes, the darker it gets. The deeper he goes, the more the
axe-handle rolls in his hand.

hand-signals back at us that seem like the Chinese version of

This is someone new. And the man....
The man is missing.

It takes a beat for Gina to realize what she means.

“Wow.”

CYDNEY (CONT’D)
Some kids run away from their parents?
Mine sorta ran away from me. Did the
foster-scare thing, but that lasted
just until I met this guy, “Rocky,”
couple years older. Now most people
thought Rocky was this fine young
gentleman, but I saw something else -something risky. Something crooked

And you could go wherever you wanted

Drove me down to the lake one night.
It was hot but raining, kind of like

hoping this is why we came down here.

vinyl seat pinched the back of my
legs, and that was bothering me but
what he was doing with his fingers

way to let him do it more, “Oh, God,
do it more,” and then suddenly he was
in my hand all slippery and nice and

Just beyond the reach of the lantern, Cliff circles the
strangers’ camp, trying to get to the other side, trying to
locate that missing man.
VOICE (O.S.)

Hey.

Spring-loaded, Cliff whirls, grabbing, shoving the man up
against a tree trunk, cocking the axe behind one ear.
You Cliff?
It’s “Chronic.”

Cliff Anderson?

The doper son from the general store.

Ran into your two friends. They
looked a little spooked. What’d you
say to them, anyway?

Gloved up, Gina slips the axe out of his hand. She pushes a
button on the handle -- a button he never saw -- and a knife
jumps from the bottom of the handle: These people have
weapons inside weapons.
GINA (CONT’D)
Spent one summer in the meat
department at Piggly Wiggly’s, so

She rips the goat from sternum to anus. As with everything,
Gina does it with a certain tawdry panache.

the Handycam down...
She accidentally depresses the memory stick. It ejects.
She pushes it back in its slot -- and that activates the

It’s Cliff -- or at least the guy we know as “Cliff.” But
now he has stringy locks, chin hair, predatory eyes. With
him is...
“Cydney.”

Only now she’s a dirty blonde with eyebrow-rings.

WIDER to show that we’re on a wharf in Honolulu Harbor. Rain
and THUMPING CLUB MUSIC helped dampen the gunshots. There’s
a second body here, too, that of...
The real Cydney. She lies next to her husband of three days,

full effect. When "Cydney" goes lax...

Gina torques free, stripping the stiletto from “Cydney’s”

Rising as if to meet the attack...

Then dropping low, chopping "Cydney" at the knees.
Still coming down, the stiletto digs into Gina’s ass.

Still nothing. With an inspiration, Gina grubs through her

Just one overturned kayak. Nothing else.

Gina steals another photo.

Still nobody.

She scans the ocean. Are they paddling back to the beach?
Where the hell are they? Her suspicion returns to...
The cliff below her.
CLOSE on Gina’s feet.

Inching closer to the edge.

GINA’S POV: Easing out over the sea-cliff. Trying to see
more. Needing to know if they’re climbing up to get her.
And just as every nerve-ending in her body is focused on the
danger below...
Her PHONE GOES OFF. It scares the wet crap out of us. Gina
thumbs “TALK” -- and doesn’t. We HEAR BREATHING on the other
end. Is it him? Is “Cliff” calling her now?

Who is this?

We can almost hear Woody’s brain hitting the frying pan on
the other end of the call: This wasn’t covered in training.

On the ocean below, "Cydney" appears. She’s paddling a kayak
backwards, away from shore, stopping when she sees Gina.
She’s too far away to be a threat. So what is she doing?

Can you swear to me you’ll do this?
Please, please, swear to me you will.

"Cydney" spotting for him, he made a blind-grab for Gina.

Gina kicks for all she’s worth.
“Cliff’s” other hand appears -- with a BLASTING 9MM.
Nightmare of nightmares: Some sociopath who you can’t see -and who can’t see you -- has you by the ankle and is PUMPING

She’s free.
"Cliff" makes one more blind-grab.
