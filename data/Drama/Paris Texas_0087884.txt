A-dark figure of a man, chasing a

she is trying to hide in. He beats Cok
her up badly.
These images are only seen as

TRAVIS (Cont'd)

And when she told him these dreams,
he believed them. He knew she had
to be stopped or she'd leave him
forever. So he tied a cow bell to
her ankle so he'd hear at night if
she tried to get out of bed. But she
learned how to muffle tbe bell by

.stuffing a sock into it and incbing. +. i.

her way out of bed and into the night.
He caught her one night when the

sock fell out, and he heard her trying
to run to the highway. He caught her
and he dragged her back to the trailer
and tied har to the stove with his
belt. He just left her there and
went back to bed and lay there listening
to ber scream. Tben he listened to
his son scream, and he-was surprised:
at himself because he didn't feel
snything anymore. All he wanted to

do wss sleep. And outside, the world
seemed very quiet. All he could hear
was a distant truck. And for the
first time, he wished he was far away.
Lost in a deep, vast country where
nobody knew him. Somewhere without
lisnguage or streets. And he dreamad
about this place without knowing its
name. And when he woke up, he was on
fire. There were blue flames burning
the sheets of his bed. He ran through
the flames toward the only two people
he loved, but they were gone. His
arms were burning and he threw himself
outside and rolled on the wet ground.
Then he ran. He nevar looked back at
the fire. He just ran. He ran until the
sun came up and he couldn't run any
further. When the sun went down, he
ran again. For five days, be ran like
this until every sign of man had
disappeared.

I-- I used to make up long speeches
to you. After you left. I used to
talk to you all the time, even
though I was alone. I walked around
for months talking to you. Now I
don't know whst to aay. It was
easier when I just imagined you. I
even imagined you talking back to me.
The two of us. We'd have long
conversations. It was almost like
you were there. .I could see you and
smell you. I could hear your voice.
Sometimes your voice would wske me
up. I'd hear it in the middle of
the night just like you were there
in the room with me. Then slowly

it faded. I couldn't picture you
anymore. I tried to talk out loud
to you like I used to, but there
was nothing there. I couldn't hesr
you. Then-- I just gave up.
Everything stopped. You-- just
disappeared. _Now I'm working here.
I hear your voice all the time.
Every man has your voice.
