FADE IN:
INT. WAITING ROOM - DAY

A sign featuring the U.S. flag tells us that we're on the
premises of "R & D: IMAGINING OUR FUTURE".

STAN (twenties) waits. Nervously. A GUARD waits with him.

Stan taps instructions into his "Bee", a device he wears like
a wristwatch. STAN'S GUIDE (a hologram that is his
information interface with the world) pops up in front of
him, in the form of a SEXY BLONDE, who smiles seductively:

STAN'S GUIDE
Hey Stan.

STAN
Messages?

STAN'S GUIDE
Sorry, sweetie.

Stan taps his Bee, and she changes looks and voices as she
continues (he's scrolling through different versions of his
Guide):

STAN'S GUIDE
How 'bout some music while you
wait? You love that new cut by --

A door opens. Stan taps his Bee; his Guide disappears.

0 walks in. He's a male android who looks completely
human -- like an executive in a business suit: calm, easy,
self-assured -- except that he's quicker, sleeker, more
efficient. His (human) assistant, MANDY, accompanies him.

0
Sorry to keep you waiting, Stan,
busy day.

0 nods to the Guard, who leaves. Stan blurts out anxiously:

STAN
Listen, I know I blew the last --

0
We don't expect anybody to get it
right all the time, humans aren't
capable of that.

Stan isn't sure whether this is good or bad...
0
Joke, Stan, loosen up. What we
look for is imagination, nobody
bats a thousand. I've got good
news: we're going to promote you.

Stan relaxes: maybe everything is okay.

0
They're going to adjust your
retinal scan for security, Mandy
will fill you in. If you have any
questions, just give me a shout.

Mandy opens a door to an anteroom. Stan, heartened, goes
through the door. Smells something. Stops, panicked. Turns
back -- but the door slams shut.

A blinding red light flashes around the door frame.

0
It's the smell that frightens
them, we need to work on that.

MANDY
(making a note)
Smells like X bombs -- that kind
of sensory-inspired fear is hard
to get rid of in us humans --

0 smiles -- a smile that turns your blood cold. Mandy
realizes she's committed a faux-pas -- and is frightened:
MANDY

Sorry about that "us humans",
wasn't thinking.

0
I'm not sensitive, you know that.

MANDY
I also know you want to be treated
as if you're like us.

0 shrugs it off, and strides out, tapping his Bee, which is
implanted in his wrist:

0
We're coming to look at potential
replacements for Stan of the
Holloway family --

EXT. THE CITY - DAY

Welcome to America a few years from now. It doesn't look
very different from today. It's much more crowded -- large
buildings hunch up against each other, soaring shafts of
steam plume out of buildings and up from beneath the
streets -- but everything is organized, clean and
emphatically fun: more Disneyland than Blade Runner.

The busy masses of people are polite -- if very much in their
own worlds, occupied with their Bees and Guides.

They pay little attention to (if they notice at all) the bomb
sites everywhere. A cafe, a church, the whole front of a
building are all being repaired by efficient, partially
automated crews.

The destruction is hidden by temporary walls, onto which
(like the walls of all the buildings) is projected news,
entertainment and ads. It's all bright, upbeat and
distracting... like this ad:

ANNOUNCER
Upgrade to your new, free Bee 6.0
today and receive TwO THOUSAND
free credits, plus fifteen points
toward Premiere Status.

The Announcer morphs as people pass, their own Bees altering
the Announcer's look and voice:

ANNOUNCER
Bee 6 features SenseWorks, our
fresh new interface that makes it
easier than ever to change your
Guide. Don't like blondes? Gone.
Want your Guide's voice lower?
Your sense is our command. And
your own custom images and
vocabulary styles are easier than
ever to upload.

The Bee device in the ad morphs into a smiling honey bee.
ANNOUNCER
Remember, we're your Bee -- but to
us, you're always A.

A BOY passes the ad. The bee winks at him. He pulls his
MOTHER's sleeve:
LITTLE BOY
Mommy mommy, I want it --

CUT TO:
INT. GROCERY STORE - DAY
A WOMAN IN A LEATHER JACKET AND JEANS (TINA) puts a jar of
mayonnaise into her grocery bag and walks out of the store.
There's no checker; nowhere to pay. Instead, as she leaves,
her hologram Guide (a studly guy) pops up in front of her:
TINA'S GUIDE

Yo Tina, that's thirty-six bucks,

twenty cents. Want to take that

outa your general account?

TINA
Yeah.

EXT. STREET - DAY

Tina comes upon a BANK that has just been bombed. It's still
smoldering, workers are pulling out bodies, and sliding in
temporary walls to mask the devastation.

Tina is the only passer-by who stops and looks. Her studly
Guide tries to distract her:

TINA'S GUIDE
This branch is closed, babe,
there's one at Main and Sixth.
Tina peers at the damage inside the bank. Smiles.
TINA'S GUIDE
Hey Tina, I got real-time video of
Michael Jackson being released
from prison right this minute!
VIDEO of, yes, Michael Jackson getting out of prison is
projected from Tina's Bee onto a temporary wall as it is
fixed into place, blocking Tina's view of the bombed bank.
CUT TO:
EXT. SEEDY APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
Tina passes a lamp-post. ZOOM INTO THE LAMP --
SURVEILLANCE VIDEO (FROM THE LAMP-POST)

Tina goes into the building.
INT. SEEDY APARTMENT - DAY

Tina walks into the microscopic one-room apartment. The only
window is blacked-out with aluminum foil, which is covered on
the inside with a something white and gooey.

Two other CELL MEMBERS (a MAN dressed as a GARDENER and a
TEENAGED BOY) assemble three bombs at the kitchen table.

GARDENER
You get them?

Tina takes three metal vials of liquid out of her purse.
Hands one to the Gardener, another to the Teenager, and slips
the third into her pocket.

The Teenager starts to open his vial --

TINA
(alarmed)
Not now!

Rattled, the Teenager puts the unopened vial into his pocket.
CUT TO:
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

0 strides in, trailed by Mandy. TWO ASSISTANTS who have been
arguing with each other immediately quiet themselves.

0
So. Replacement for the brother
in the Holloway family.

FIRST ASSISTANT
(jumping in quickly)
Hank Skinner --

The four walls come alive with surveillance video of HANK
(twenties; a normal, worker-bee, upwardly mobile guy -- or
that's what he wants to believe; underneath, he's intuitive,
creative, bright -- but he denies these qualities even to
himself, sensing that they are not useful, even suspect).

FIRST ASSISTANT
Smart, funny, loyal, hard worker --

SECOND ASSISTANT
He's risky, his parents were
revolutionaries -- members of the
so-called Free Republic.
0
Do I detect sarcasm? They had the
right to call themselves whatever
they liked, it's a free country.

SECOND ASSISTANT
They engaged in illegal acts
against the State --

0
And they failed, nobody remembers
anything about them any more, they
didn't engage the popular
imagination. Not surprising with
a name like "Free Republic".

FIRST ASSISTANT
(pointedly, to Second
Assistant)

Anyway, they're dead.
(to 0)
Years ago, car accident --

0
That works for us.

SECOND ASSISTANT
Unless the apple doesn't fall far
from the tree.

0
Any sign of revolutionary
sympathies?

SECOND ASSISTANT
Hard to say, he keeps his head
down.

FIRST ASSISTANT
We'd know. I mean...

He gestures to the surveillance info that surrounds them.

SECOND ASSISTANT
But we don't necessarily know,
surveillance doesn't tell us
everything -- isn't that why we're
recruiting these people for R & D?

0
It's about balance. You want them
to have initiative, be curious,
creative -- but not too much.
FIRST ASSISTANT
And that's why Hank's perfect.
This was taken this morning --

The walls display SURVEILLANCE VIDEO shot through windows,
from satellites, etc. It's much better than back in 2004:
crisp and clear, if always from outside.

INT. HANK'S APARTMENT - DAY (SURVEILLANCE VIDEO)

(A nice but miniscule apartment.) HANK, in his boxers, sits
beside his bed, drawing on a sketchpad.

FIRST ASSISTANT (0.S.)
Wait till you see this...

SURVEILLANCE VIDEO FROM ANOTHER ANGLE OUTSIDE THE APARTMENT
MOVES IN ON HANK'S SKETCH:

The sketch is of his girlfriend VAL, who is asleep in bed.
Looks just like her -- except that he has drawn her pregnant,
and she doesn't look it.

FIRST ASSISTANT (0.S.)
Val Abbott, they've been together
off and on since college, she
moved in for the first time five
months ago when she lost her job --

SECOND ASSISTANT (0.S.)
Live-in girlfriend, that's a
problem.

0 (0.S.)
Or something we can use.

Val wakes up. Hanks puts away the sketchpad -- but not quick
enough. She reaches for it. He holds it away. She thinks
it's a game, tickles Hank to make him let go of the pad:

VAL
Come on, let me see --

She sees that he has drawn her pregnant. Freezes.

VAL
How'd you know?

HANK
(disappointed)
Why didn't you tell me?
VAL
I just found out yesterday, I was
going to but...

HANK
Not a good sign, is it? About us.

He forces a smile. Gets up and heads to the bathroom.
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

Photos of Hank's sketches pop up on the wall screens. They
uncannily capture the subjects' moods, thoughts, secrets.

FIRST ASSISTANT
He sees people -- perceives who
they are, what they want, what
they're hiding. Right up our
alley.

 

0
Very promising.

SECOND ASSISTANT
But she's pregnant -- would he be
willing to leave her behind?

0
He seems ambivalent, maybe we can
take advantage of that if we move
fast. Have we got a way into him?

INTERCUT WITH SURVEILLANCE VIDEO from the wall screens:
INT. DAVE'S APARTMENT - DAY (SURVEILLANCE VIDEO)

One-room, puny (all the homes are claustrophobic). A sickly
man (DAVE SKINNER, thirty) stumbles from bed to the bathroom.

FIRST ASSISTANT
Hank's older brother Dave. Only
sibling, no other relatives.
Neuroendocrine carcinoma. Stable
now but still suffers.

0
He can't afford an SCI? And
neither, I suppose, can Hank.

FIRST ASSISTANT
Neither of them are even close to
Premiere Status.
0
That's a nice shiny carrot.

Other images are projected onto the wall screens: Hank at
work, at the gym; out to dinner will Val, on vacations, etc.

FIRST ASSISTANT
Hank doesn't lose his cool.
Anything goes wrong, he sucks it
up and keeps everything under
control. Doesn't even vote --
seems politically indifferent. A
perfect citizen.

SECOND ASSISTANT
Or he's a revolutionary in
disguise, keeping a low profile.

FIRST ASSISTANT
There's no sign of that. Also,
he's a great match for the
Holloway family. He had a strong,
creative mother, a preoccupied
father, one sibling --

SECOND ASSISTANT
The Holloway matriarch is a
grandmother, not a mother, the
sibling is a sister, not a
brother --

FIRST ASSISTANT
The psychological and emotional
dynamics match, the all bode well
for an easy adjustment.

SECOND ASSISTANT

I've got some troubling file

footage --
A new video file appears on a wall screen:
INT. SPORTS BAR - NIGHT (SURVEILLANCE VIDEO)
Hank is out with some BUDDIES, among them DUANE. Different
sports games with odds tickers are broadcast on screens, as
the guys eagerly place bets with their Bees:

HANK DUANE
Get it, get it away from -- Catch the ball you --

Duane's Guide, a NAKED BIMBO, pops up:
10.

DUANE'S GUIDE
Hey handsome, that dickhead Palmer
just lost you two hundred bucks.

HANK
(laughing)
You bet on Palmer? Palmer?
What's wrong with you?

He grabs Duane's arm, slips Duane's Bee off his wrist --

Hank taps

DUANE'S GUIDE
Duane, your Bee's off!

DUANE
I'll lose points -- !

some instructions into Duane's Bee --

DUANE'S GUIDE
Hey stud, they just docked you
twenty Premiere points -- and you
were so close to Premiere status --

DUANE
Hank come on, quit messing --

Hank points his Bee at Duane's bee. Laser communication
shoots between them --

Duane's bimbo Guide hiccups and rewinds, then giggles at him:

 

DUANE'S GUIDE
Ooo -- you just upgraded, sexy,
you're more massive than ever!
Welcome to Bee 6.0.

HANK
Your bet's erased. Check it out.

Hank slips the Bee back on Duane's wrist.

DUANE
How'd you do that?

Hank makes sure nobody's watching, then whispers to Duane --

SURVEILLANCE VIDEO FINDS A DIFFERENT ANGLE AND PUSHES IN:

HANK
When it was re-writing your
software, it wrote over the last
two minutes.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

0
Lots of people figured out that
bug.

SECOND ASSISTANT
Do we want those people working
for R & D?

FIRST ASSISTANT
They're exactly the people we
need -- resourceful, imaginative --

SECOND ASSISTANT
Anti-establishment? Maybe even
revolutionary? I know it's a
balancing act finding the right
kind of recruit, but we can't keep
erring in the wrong direction.

0
That's why I'm here -- androids
are much better equipped for risk-
assessment than humans.
The Second Assistant, chastened, nods. As O heads out:
0
Besides, if he doesn't work out,
he can always be promoted.
CUT TO:
INT. HANK'S APARTMENT - DAY
Hank and Val grab breakfast, moving around each other with
the ease of people who know each other well -- and with the
caution of lovers who know the ice is thin:

HANK
I got these chem-berries for you.

VAL
They're so expensive --

HANK
Don't worry about it.

VAL
Easy for you to say.

He dishes the berries into a bowl for her. End of discussion.
12.

VAL
. Thanks.
(eating them, can't
help but smile: )
Remember that trip we took to the
coast -- when you could still pick
berries for real?

HANK
These are sweeter.

VAL
(diving in:)
I didn't tell you about... that I
was pregnant because I didn't want
it to be the reason. The reason
we split up or stay together.

Hank nods, pours ingredients into a blender.

VAL
I know you're scared, I'm scared,
too --
HANK
I'm not scared.
VAL
Hank -- let me in for once...

Hank turns on the blender. She turns it off.

VAL
You know, the world won't come to
an end if you let me know how you
feel once in a while.

HANK
I don't feel things as strong as
you do --

He turns the blender back on. She speaks over it:

VAL
I see you sketching -- you see
things, you feel things most
people can't -- how else could you
have known I'm --

HANK
They're just drawings, they don't
mean anything.

She turns off the blender:
13.

VAL
Just cause your mother was an
artist and got in trouble --

HANK

This has nothing to do with them.
VAL

Then what're you scared of?
HANK

I'm not scared. It's just -- the

only thing that's private any more
is how you feel, it's the only
thing that's all yours.

VAL
(not what she wanted
to hear)
You want this baby? Otherwise...

HANK
Otherwise what?

VAL
.» I don't know. Sanctioned
abortions are expensive.

HANK
Not like we don't have the money.

VAL
I don't -- I don't have a job, I
don't have an apartment --

HANK
You have here.

VAL
Not if we split up.

HANK
You can stay here, I've got a job,
I've got money, we can do whatever
we want.

VAL
. So what does that mean, you
want to? Get an abortion?

HANK
What do you want?
14.

VAL
I want to know what you want.

HANK
... I don't know. Sorry, really,
it's just sudden -- Look, I gotta
get to work, we'll talk about it
tonight -- okay?
VAL
I knew this would screw up
everything.
HANK
(drawing her close)
It'll be okay. Tonight, okay?

The park is perfect: clean, sunny, the trees immaculately

0
Look at this park, it's perfect --
too perfect, I'm told. I mean I
like it, but then I'm synthetic.
It should have been designed by
people like you instead of by
bureaucrats with computers.

HANK
What does this have to do with --

0
Technology, despite its advances,
has no heart. And therefore it
can't read hearts. Turns out
that's the missing link in the
security puzzle.

HANK
I don't get it -- I'd be, what,
"imagining" stuff all day?
Drawing sketches of terrorists?

0
It's more about elaborating on
data.

HANK
You've got people trained for
that, intelligence officers --

0
Intelligence, not imagination --
different wiring. We get lots of
chatter which we know is important
but which defies a logical
approach. People like you help us
figure out what the bad guys
intend.

You will once you start doing it.
Whether you know it or not, by
sensing what people feel, you can
extrapolate motives and thoughts.
Everybody we recruit feels the way

Michelangelo was ambidextrous, did

themselves as families -- it
incubates their potential skills.

HANK

You'll be making five figures

HANK
So what do you want me to do?

DAVE
You can't work for the bad guys.

HANK
(talking himself into
it)
Mom and Dad were wrong, Universal
Surveillance isn't so bad -- it
keeps us safe, right?
DAVE
You really feel safe?
HANK
Sure.
DAVE

I haven't felt safe a minute of my
life since they died.

(admiring him)
Somehow you got their... bigness,
their steadiness.

HANK
Come on --
DAVE
You come on -- don't pretend you

didn't, not now.

HANK
(seeing it means so
much to him: )
. Okay.

DAVE
Even when you were a kid -- Mom'd
be finger-painting with you, I'd
turn up the TV loud, but she
wouldn't even look at me, not even
to tell me to turn it down. She'd
stand behind you, tell you to
concentrate, not listen to the TV,
just zone it out and concentrate
on whatever you were painting.
She'd put her hands over yours and
you paint together.

HANK
How do you remember this? I don't
even remember it --

DAVE
The fridge was plastered with your
shit.

DAVE (cont'd)
One of your finger-paintings, a
sunflower, your masterpiece, it
stayed there till...

I'm just so scared, man.

Hank grabs Dave's hand:

HANK
You're gonna be okay.

We're in Church Four.

INT. CHURCH FOUR - NIGHT

Hank walks into an empty room. There are pews, but nothing
else: no religious iconography or decoration.

HANK'S GUIDE
Catholic? Methodist? Jewish?

HANK
The usual.

Disappeared -- or left you?

A LAB TECH selects an earwig (a tiny device that fits in the
ear) from a tray:

TECH
This won't hurt.

Hank regards the earwig warily as the Tech brings it to

TECH
You can trust me, I'm programmed
specifically for this task.
He fits it in Hank's ear --

Hey handsome.

Go ahead and answer him.

HANK
There's no mike --

Don't need one, I can hear you.

The earwig sprouts legs, and burrows into Hank's ear,
clamping down --

 

HANK (0.S.)
Hey! Something's wrong --

EXT. HOLLOWAY HOUSE - DAY
Hank approaches, slows in amazement. It's a big old wood

Craftsman house, a real throw-back. The city has built up
around it, enclosing it...
30.

Hank knocks on the door. It's opened by MRS. JACKSON, sixty-
ish, with a big, kind grandmotherly smile -- but make no
mistake, she's sharp, and the sugar masks vinegar underneath:

MRS. JACKSON
Mr. Skinner, you're here. Was the
traffic bad? We were worried...

Hank steps in, through the looking-glass --
INT. HOLLOWAY HOUSE - DAY

HANK
Worried...?

MRS. JACKSON
Well, you are ten minutes late.
They like us to get these family
conferences started on time --

HANK
Yeah, about this "family" stuff --

MRS. JACKSON
You're a member of the Holloway
family now, we pride ourselves on
being punctual. But the cookies
are still warm, I baked them
myself.

She offers him a plate of fresh-baked cookies. You don't say
no to her. Hank reaches for one --

SUSANNA
Don't touch them!

Hank jerks his hand away.

SUSANNA BLADE (early twenties, seems self-assured, has great
equipment and knows how to work it) steps in, singing "White
Rabbit":

SUSANNA
"One pill makes you larger, and
one pill makes you small -- "
(taking him in: )
You must be my new brother --

HANK
New brother?
31.

SUSANNA
You're replacing Stan, he was the
hottest brother I ever had... till
now.

MRS. JACKSON
Susanna's an "actress" -- she
tried so hard, didn't you, dear?
She's been much more successful
with our work here in the family.

SUSANNA
Why Grandma, what sharp teeth you
have.

MRS. JACKSON
(ignoring her, to
Hank)
So we understand you're an artist?
Very impressive.

HANK
It's just something I do, I've got
a real job.

MRS. JACKSON
You have a really important job
now, young man.

SUSANNA
I used to be an artist's model --
nude modelling. Wanna do me?

MRS. JACKSON
I'm a writer -- you've probably
never heard of me: Frank Jackson?

HANK
Frank Jackson, the spy thrillers?

MRS. JACKSON
Publishers thought they'd sell
better with a male name.

HANK
But your books are so...
(stops himself)

MRS. JACKSON
Masculine? I was in military
intelligence. When they put me
out to pasture, I took up writing.
32.

SUSANNA
She gives most of her royalties to
the National Rifle Association.
Seriously.

MRS. JACKSON
Well we can't all be bohemians.

GILMAN HOLLOWAY (forties) comes downstairs, carrying a toy
Flash Gordon-type weapon. He's passionate about the work,
but the passion hides a dark anger and fear underneath:

GILMAN
(to Hank)
Sorry to be late -- Gilman
Holloway -- I'm the "Dad". I was
up all night with this --

He points the toy weapon at a wall and FIRES IT.

There's a nearly silent BLAST -- but when the smoke clears,
the wall looks unchanged.

SUSANNA
I've had nights like that.

Gilman sticks his hand through where he fired: that part of
the wall has been blasted away, replaced by a hologram of the
wall the way it was.

 

GILMAN
It takes a photo of the target
right before it fires, then
instantly projects a hologram of
the target the way it was.

SUSANNA
Cool.

MRS. JACKSON
That's how Al Amir got into the
power plant without anyone knowing?
(off Gilman's nod)
0 will be pleased. Have a cookie.
(to Hank, proudly)
Gilman's the one who figured out
how to get the Star Wars shield up
and running.

GILMAN
Didn't do much good, turned out
the enemy was inside the shield.

33.

GILMAN (cont'd)
(re: the weapon: )
Stupid looking prototype, but it
was lying around.

SUSANNA

(quietly)
Was it Amy's?

(off Gilman's nod, to

Hank)
This was Gilman's house, his kid
sister Amy was killed by
terrorists.

MRS. JACKSON
And he's done an excellent job of
moving on.

GILMAN
Mrs. J lost her husband and son in
the line of duty --

MRS. JACKSON
Shall we "move on" into the family

INT. SHOPPING MALL - DAY - SURVEILLANCE VIDEO

The Gardener (the male Cell Member), works on a planter --
hiding in it the plastic bag containing the last bomb. The

The wall screens are filled with shots of the three cell
members planting their bombs.

XRAY SHOTS ZOOM IN ON THE purse, locker and plastic bag,
revealing black blobs inside --

As 0 briefs the family (Hank, Susanna, Mrs. Jackson and
Gilman) via a holographic video hook-up:

0
We've been tracking Tina Falk's
cell for several days, no apparent
connections to other terrorist
groups.

MRS. JACKSON
There are so many out there.
34.

0
We believe these devices to be
bombs, but they've somehow
disguised them so we can't get
visuals. Of course, that makes
them suspicious in and of itself --

HANK
Why haven't you arrested them? Or
picked up those bombs?

SUSANNA
‘Cause the bombs are decoys,
right? Look at her body
language --

She imitates Tina, as surveillance video showing Tina
planting her purse in the office is projected on the wall:

SUSANNA
She's putting on a show -- making
sure she's not blocking a
surveillance camera, opening the
drawer more than necessary so we
can see inside. It's like she
wants surveillance to see her.

0
Exactly. What we need you to
figure out is, Why plant decoys?
What are they trying to distract
us from?

HANK
I still don't get why you don't
arrest them.

0
You think they'll just tell us
what their plan is? We have to
keep the cell in play until you
can figure it out.

HANK
But if those are real bombs,
they're gonna go off --

MRS. JACKSON
And that's why we need to get to
work, dear.
(for her earwig: )
Decoys, domestic terrorist groups.

Research files pop up on the wall in front of her --

INT. DINER - DAY

Susanna leads Hank in, as she listens to her earwig:

SURVEILLANCE TECH (V.O.)
-- second table to your left.

Susanna looks at that table, spots Tina eating alone.
Susanna leads Hank to a table facing Tina, who is oblivious:

SUSANNA
So what's she thinking about?

HANK
I'm not psychic.

SUSANNA
Me, I need to imitate their body
language, act them out -- it helps
me get inside their skin, feel
what they're feeling. Maybe you
need to do something like that to
draw them.

They look at Tina, who is eating a huge lunch. A WAITRESS
brings her a jar of McMahon's mayonnaise which she slathers
on her food.

SUSANNA
She can put it away.

HANK
And she's so skinny.

SUSANNA
I hate her.

Susanna hands him a pencil, as if to say: Go.

Hank picks up the pencil. Looks at Tina as he takes his

sketchpad out of his backpack. Puts pencil to paper -- draws
for a moment -- then tosses the pencil down:
HANK

This is stupid.
36.

He gets up. Susanna grabs his hand:

SUSANNA
Find a way to make it work.

He's surprised by her urgency.

SUSANNA
You don't run out on your family.

HANK
I have my own family.

SUSANNA
Well I don't -- or I didn't before
the Holloways. My foster parents
adopted me for the benefits, I got
them on the fast track to Premiere

Status.
HANK
What about your birth parents?
SUSANNA
Don't know. The Holloways are my
family now.

HANK

God! What're you, watching me

INTERCUT:
INT. O'S OFFICE - NIGHT
Surveillance of Hank in his apartment is on a wall screen.

But O is gazing at another image (which we don't see -- yet)
with... well, lust. What is it he's looking at?

0
We can give you something to help
you sleep.

HANK
You been able to find anything
about Val?

0
The last surveillance we have of
her is at the Northern railroad

station -- taking off her Bee.
That makes tracing her more
challenging...

We finally see what 0 is gazing at lustily on a wall screen:
it's Val, asleep in a jail cell.
0
Don't worry, we'll find her.
Hank turns off his lamp.
WE STAY WITH O:

Without taking his eyes off Val, O drops his hand and starts
stroking down there, rhythmically, faster and faster --

Suddenly, he stops, aware of something, spins around to see:

Mandy (his assistant) staring at him, shocked. She's just
come in; her hand is still on the door.

 

In one incredibly fast movement, O zips up his pants, shuts
the door and forces Mandy to sit down.

He looks down at her, regaining his composure and power,
waiting for her to say something.

MANDY

0
Unfortunately. But I have had
some work done.

MANDY
"Work". ..?

Some people have surgery to change
their mood or improve their
strength -- I went in for neural
transplants.

He goes to his desk, takes out a syringe and a plastic vial:

Synthetic cells. They speed up
synapse connections, enable me to
process information more
efficiently --

As Mandy watches, not daring to move, O drains down the vial
into the syringe...

0
People don't question androids.
They trust them to make
unemotional choices, efficient
decisions. It's easier to
maintain authority when people
don't question you.

He whips a rubber strap out of his desk, tourniquets it
around his arm, and shoots up:

0
Experimental but the results speak
for themselves. Although I
haven't been able to rid myself of
all emotions yet -- as you saw.

He pops off the strap -- and, holding the drained syringe,

He jabs the syringe into her neck, emptying air into her vein.

CUT TO:

INT. HANK'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Hank wakes up -- the apartment is filled with fog... or is it
steam? It's weird, nightmarish...

Alarmed, Hank rises, trying to peer through it. He slides
silently out of bed, treads carefully toward the kitchen --

A hand grabs his arm. Hank spins toward the intruder.
Through the fog, all he can see is a powerful man --

The man (REB) drags Hank to the stove, pushes Hank's head
down toward a pot of boiling water. Hank desperately
struggles to free himself --

 

But Reb is too strong -- he twists Hank's head so that Hank's

 

ear is right over the boiling water --

 

Hank furiously fights to get free --

Suddenly, Reb lets go of Hank's head -- but then he grabs
Hank's arm and holds it over the boiling water:

REB
I'm not going to hurt you. Their
surveillance doesn't work through
steam -- I temporarily disabled
your earwig, now I'm going to do
your Bee.

Hank looks at his Bee through the steam -- its display
fizzles out.

REB
I've only got a minute before
they're back online.
40.

Hank sees that the steam that shrouds the apartment comes
from a device strapped to Reb:

HANK
Who the hell are you?

REB
I don't have a name, I don't
exist, not in Their records. I'm
going to let you go, okay?

Hank nods. Reb lets him go.
Hank lunges for the door. Reb grabs him. They struggle.

REB
Listen to me, listen! Your job,
it's bogus, they're lying to you.

Reb gets Hank in a clinch:

REB
You think your bank accounts just
happened to be depleted the day
They offered you a job? Your
girlfriend didn't take your money.

HANK
(floored)
. What do you know about her?

REB
Your brother's cancer, why do you
think it suddenly got worse?

HANK
...What're you saying? They
somehow spread his cancer so I'd --

REB
They're going to tell you your
girlfriend is dead.

HANK
what??

REB
They're going to tell you she's
dead, it's the way they work, cut
you off so you have nobody but
your new "Family". They did it to
your predecessor, but he wouldn't
play along, that's why they
"promoted" him.
41.

Hank's Bee buzzes back to life. Reb spots it.

HANK
What're you saying? They killed
him?

Reb disappears into the steam.

HANK
Where's Val?

Hank peers around as the steam dissipates. Reb is gone.

CUT TO:
INT. HOLLOWAY HOUSE FAMILY ROOM - DAY

Wall screens are filled with images. Hank and Susanna pour
over surveillance files of Tina and the other cell members;
Mrs. Jackson and Gilman refer to weapons files while
consulting with 0 in his office via the video hologram:

MRS. JACKSON
I can't find any precedent of
decoy bombs that are fake -- to
divert attention, the decoy has to
be a real threat.

GILMAN

what the bombs might be, but there
is evidence of timing devices.

How much time do we have?

Gilman shakes his head; he doesn't know.

MRS. JACKSON
We're focusing on the wrong thing:
The decoys are irrelevant, they'll
only cause collateral damage --

HANK
"Collateral damage"? You mean
they'll only kill irrelevant
people?

MRS. JACKSON

Of course not dear, I mean
whatever this cell is planning has
to be bigger than a couple of
hundred casualties.

(to 0)
You should arrest those three
terrible people and interrogate
them.

GILMAN
There may be other cell members
involved, you don't want to tip
them off --

HANK
This is weird -- they're all
eating tons of food.

MRS. JACKSON
(impatiently)
Do try to stay focused, Hank --

Surveillance shows Tina, the Teenager and the Gardener eating
huge meals everywhere.

HANK
I mean, look at Tina: She's skinny
as a rail but since last week
she's been putting it away.

SUSANNA
And the teenager and the other guy
have been porking out too.

GILMAN
McMahon's mayonnaise.

MRS. JACKSON
what?
43.

HANK
He's right, McMahon's
mayonnaise -- it's in every shot,
they're all eating it.

MRS. JACKSON
(thinking out loud: )
Maybe it's a signal -- or maybe
they're preparing to run off...

SUSANNA
What're you saying, they're
squirreling away mayonnaise for
the winter?

MRS. JACKSON
I'm sure you must have a better
idea then, dear.

SUSANNA
(thinking out loud)
McMahon's is the fattest kind of
mayonnaise around -- why would
they all want to put on weight?

HANK
To raise their cholesterol -- ?

GILMAN
That would take months...

Hank takes out his pad and starts sketching Tina...
CUT TO:
INT. SEEDY APARTMENT - DAY

Tina, the Teenaged Boy and the Gardener finish sandwiches,
which they slather with McMahon's Mayonnaise.

Some of that gooey white substance covering the aluminum foil
that blocks the window slides off. The Gardener gets up,
slaps some more mayonnaise over the window in its place.

 

TINA
It's time for our next step.

The Teenaged Boy and Gardener glance at each other...
TINA

No seeing each other any more
until the action. Right?

The Gardener folds the Teenager into an embrace, as if
they're father and son -- and never going to see each other
again.

They rise somberly; something weighty just happened...
CUT TO:
INT. HOLLOWAY KITCHEN - NIGHT
Hank comes in; Susanna makes a salad, her back to him:
SUSANNA
I hope you're not vegetarian.
Kissing vegetarians is like making
out with a lawn.

Hank is surprised that Susanna knew he was there without
seeing him. Mrs. Jackson, working at a counter, notices:

MRS. JACKSON
Eyes in the back of her head.

Susanna moves to the stove to check out pasta which boils
away, cascading steam around her.

MRS. JACKSON
And a real bitch in bed.

That surprises Hank. Susanna doesn't react.

MRS. JACKSON
Deaf as a post when her earwig's
off-line, poor lamb. Save
anything you don't want her to
hear for when she's steamed up.

Susanna moves away from the stove and steam.

Hank notices Mrs. Jackson is chopping two different things
with two knives, one in each hand. She catches his look:

 

MRS. JACKSON
We need to get back to work ASAP.
Those veggies need to be washed.
(as Hank does so:)
Being ambidextrous only indicates
you have a predisposition for our
work. You have to develop it.

HANK
I don't know if I can.

Gilman comes in with a color chart:
45.

GILMAN
How many colors do you see here?
HANK
Eight.
GILMAN
The Berinmo tribe in Papua New
Guinea sees five -- they only have

names for five colors. Our work,
it's like opening yourself up to
see new colors. It's wonderful.

MRS. JACKSON
My sainted father loved reading
stories aloud -- but I always knew
how they were going to end. I
could see, actually visualize, the
stories from inside the heads of
the characters. Spoiled it for
Dad. I always thought I was
freakish --

SUSANNA
Can't argue with that --

MRS. JACKSON
-- until I started doing this work.

GILMAN
Exactly, it's made me feel
normal -- no, not normal, useful.
My sister, all the other kids
played with their toys -- as soon
as I got one, I'd take it apart
and put it back together ina
better way. All they saw was
parts and computer chips -- I saw
purpose and beauty.

SUSANNA
My turn? I'm the deaf bitch in
bed.
(to Mrs. Jackson)
My earwig isn't my only resource.
I'm keeping the rest to myself.

Hank dries his hands, heads for the back door:

HANK
I'm going home for a while.

MRS. JACKSON
This is your home now.
46.

HANK
Look, I'll help you as much as I
can, but this family thing, living
together, it's too weird.
(heading out)
I just need to take a break --

MRS. JACKSON
And we need you here. You boys
always think you can come and go --

HANK
(that stops him: )
Us boys? Stan left too? I
thought he got promoted.

GILMAN
Hank please, we can't afford
another failure, they'll --

Hank won't let O see his grief. He stalks to the front door.

The irony is, you'll only be
useful to us if you allow yourself
to feel.

HANK
(turning back)
"Useful"? Are you threatening me?

0
Of course not -- but it would be
disappointing if you gave up so

quickly.

(goes to him, hands

him a card: )
Tina's address. It seems you need
to interact emotionally with the

why your drawings of Val and your

death. They're detaining her.

HANK
(wants to believe it)
How do you know?

REB
They need something to hold over
you.

HANK

Why? Why would they do that?

REB
Anybody the State can't control is
a threat to them. They want to
get rid of you, all of you with
imagination, why do you think
They're rounding you up into these
"Families"?

HANK
(distraught with
confusion)
That's crazy --

REB
Then leave, don't listen to me.

Hank starts to leave -- but something Reb says makes sense to
him, no matter how much he tries to talk himself out of it:

HANK
They need us to --

REB
Fight terrorists? That's their
excuse, and your ego.

HANK
So, what? there's no terrorists?
Is that what you're saying?
There's bombs, killings every --

REB
Of course terrorists exist,
because the State needs terrorists
to exist. Terrorists play into
Their hands --
Reb takes

50.

HANK
This is radical paranoid bullshit,
I've heard it all my --

REB
If there wasn't terrorism, we
wouldn't need security -- if we

didn't need security, we wouldn't
let the State to steal our freedom.

HANK
I'm free...

REB
How can you be free when the State
watches your every move? When
They coerce you into working for
Them?

HANK
(all he cares about: )
You know so much, help me -- help
me find Val.

REB
Help us.

several small X-shaped devices out of a bag.

HANK
(scared)
. All the X-bombs were destroyed.

REB
That's what the State thinks, so
They won't be looking for them --
or for you. Universal
Surveillance is the State's
greatest strength -- but it's also
Their greatest vulnerability: If
we can shatter it, Their power
will be devastated. We'll help
you locate Their surveillance
hubs --

HANK
But X-bombs destroy everything for
a block, they'll kill hundreds --

REB
Of Them. Some collateral damage
can't be avoided --
Hank does.

Reb takes

51.

HANK
"Collateral damage"? You're as
bad as they are --

REB
As bad as Them? They killed
hundreds of thousands. They
"amended" our Constitution until
it meant nothing. You think you
can reason with Them? Decades of
talk and protests, what good did
it do? People are more numb than
ever, they're doped up on
technology. All we're trying to
do is give people back the right
to think for themselves. You
remember what that was like.

He looks away, knowing there's truth in it...

REB
Like I said, they're not looking
for these. But just to be safe --

a jar of McMahon's Mayonnaise out of his bag.

REB
Coat them with this -- something
in the molecular structure, the
synthetic fat, surveillance can't
see through it.

Hank takes the jar of mayonnaise. That's a coincidence. He

stares at

it, not knowing what to make of it.

Reb misunderstands Hank's confusion:

Reb holds

REB
So simple, I know. But we're only
a step ahead of Them -- soon

enough They'll figure this out,
and we'll have to come up with
something else.

out the X-bombs for Hank:

REB
We'll contact you, the best way to
avoid being seen by Their
technology is not to use it.

Hank gazes at the bombs...
52.

REB
Break one arm, fifteen minute
delay. Break two arms and it goes
off right away.

Hank Shakes his head. No. He turns away without taking the
bombs, and disappears into the fog.

Hank comes in. Dave is in bed, with tubes all over the place.

DAVE
Hey.

HANK
Doctor says the operation went
well.

DAVE

(nods; then: )
Thanks, man.

HANK
No problem.

DAVE
You look like shit.

HANK
So do you.

They chuckle. Dave peers at Hank, sees something's not right:
53.

DAVE
What's up?
HANK
Everything's cool.
DAVE
Think I don't know when you're
bullshitting?
Hank takes a breath. Can he tell Dave? Hank glances up at
the surveillance camera -- realizes he has to be careful.
DAVE
Let me help you for a change.
Hank wants to -- and sees it's important to Dave, too.
HANK

It's Val, she's --
(eye on that camera)
gone.

DAVE
Gone? What do you mean? She left
you?

Hank wants to confide his doubts, but knows the camera is on:

HANK
She's dead.

DAVE
What?? Shit. How -- ?

HANK
Terrorists.

DAVE
Oh man I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
This is so screwed up, this whole
world is so... I was wrong, man,
what I said the other day, about
your job. Working for the bad
guys isn't bad if you catch worse
guys.

HANK

know)
You think?

DAVE
Mom and Dad, they were wrong.
Fighting for the Free Republic?
What did that even mean?

HANK
(cautiously)
The Free Republic was against
surveillance and centralization of
power, the State taking over
media, education --

DAVE
There are terrorists out there,
killing innocent people like Val,
they gotta be stopped. You're
doing the right thing.
He sees that Hank still isn't so sure:
DAVE
When I woke up from the operation,
I thought, I want to live, I want
to live in a world that's safe.
I'll change, I'll be more like
Hank, he's doing the right thing.
CUT TO:
INT. HANK'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Hank wheels a suitcase to the front door. Takes a last look
around. Spots his sketchbook. Stuffs it in his backpack.

DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. TINA'S SEEDY APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

The noise of a door closing wakes Hank -- he's spent the
night in the car. He looks up at the entry to the building.

Tina has just left, is heading up the street. Hank hurries
out of his car, slipping on his backpack, follows her.

CUT TO:
INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY

Students make their way past the locker in which the Teenaged
Cell Member placed the backpack with the bomb.

There is a CLICK from inside the locker --

SMASH CUT TO:
55.

INT. TINA'S OFFICE - DAY

Tina's desk EXPLODES --
SMASH CUT TO:

INT. SHOPPING MALL - DAY

BLASTS, FIRE and SCREAMS rip through the crowded mall --
CUT TO:

INT. DINER - DAY

Tina sits at her usual spot, eating her usual sandwich...

Hank takes a deep breath, goes to her:

HANK
Excuse me? This is gonna sound
weird, but... can I sketch you?
TINA
No thanks.
HANK

I'm not trying to sell you
anything, or come on to you or
anything like that -- I'm an art
student, you've got an interesting
face.

Tina shakes her head, no. Hank turns to other diners nearby:
HANK
Don't you think she's got an
interesting face?

Other diners look at her, and at this guy making a scene.
Tina doesn't want attention drawn to her:

TINA
Okay okay, do it fast.

HANK
Thanks, I really appreciate it.

Hank sits opposite her, starts sketching:

HANK
There's something cool about your
face -- you look decisive, like

someone who knows what they want.
56.

Nothing from Tina. Hank keeps pitching as he sketches:

HANK
Knowing what you want, that's the
opposite of me. I've had a lot of
different jobs -- what about you?

No response.

HANK
Hope you don't mind me talking, it
helps me get the likeness...

Hank glances at his sketch: Good likeness but not revealing.
He girds himself to go deeper:

HANK
You married? Got a family?
(no response)
I had a girlfriend, she was
pregnant. Killed. A bomb.

Tina takes him in for the first time.

HANK
You lose anybody?

TINA
who hasn't?

HANK
That's the truth.

He glances at his sketch: still nothing helpful. He grabs
the pencil tighter, pushes to provoke her to some emotion:

HANK
These terrorists, they're the
scourge of the planet, they should
be boiled in oil or something,
something worse than just death.

TINA
(rising to that)
There's lots of things worse than
death.

Hank sees a fire in Tina's eyes --
His hand starts sketching more quickly, almost independently

of him, as he focuses on Tina without looking at the pad.
The rest of the room recedes...
57.
His focus is broken when Tina's usual Waitress brings Tina a
jar of McMahon's mayonnaise with a smile:

WAITRESS
Sorry honey, forgot your usual.

Tina keeps eating without even reaching for the mayo.

 

Hank reacts: That's weird.

Suddenly, POLICE SWARM IN, grab and cuff Tina. She doesn't
resist -- in fact, she smiles.

Hank is taken aback: That's even weirder.

As the Police drag Tina off, Hank looks down at the sketch:
In his sketch, Tina is dead!

Hank, stunned, snaps his eyes back at the unopened jar of
McMahon's mayonnaise.

The penny drops. He's on his feet, stuffing the sketch in
his pocket, racing out the door, shouting into his earwig:

HANK
O -- get me O.

CUT TO:
INT. HOLLOWAY HOUSE FAMILY ROOM - DAY

Hank bursts in. Susanna, Gilman and Mrs. Jackson are quickly
flipping through wall-screen images:

HANK
I can't get O --

SUSANNA
They're in operation mode --

GILMAN
The bombs went off --

HANK
I was there when they arrested
Tina, she wanted to be arrested --

SUSANNA
Wanted to be...?

HANK
She smiled --
58.

MRS. JACKSON
Pleased the bombs went off --

HANK
No it was more than that -- the
mayonnaise, she didn't eat any
mayonnaise --

MRS. JACKSON
Jesus, the fucking mayonnaise
again, what's wrong with you.

HANK
It blocks surveillance --

GILMAN
what?

HANK
Surveillance can't see through
it -- they've been eating it
nonstop, they're trying to hide
something inside themselves!

Susanna has brought up surveillance video of the diner arrest:

SUSANNA
He's right, look, she smiles --

GILMAN
Freeze and Xray --

The image of Tina FREEZES INTO AN XRAY IMAGE. Everything
looks normal.

GILMAN
MRI it.

The image CHANGES TO AN MRI IMAGE, revealing Tina's soft
tissue and organs -- except for the area of her stomach,
which doesn't register on the image.

GILMAN
Can't see anything of her stomach.

HANK
The mayonnaise coated it --

MRS. JACKSON
. She's a Trojan horse!

SUSANNA
She wanted to be arrested --
59.

HANK
-- so she could bring something in
her stomach to wherever they're
taking her.

Gilman has projected surveillance videos of the Teenaged Boy
and Gardener being arrested.

GILMAN
Freeze and MRI.

Same thing: their stomachs don't register on the images.

O appears on the video hook-up:

0
I received your images -- I've
been supervising the arrests and
interrogations --

GILMAN

Where are they?

0
The Federal Center. This is real
time surveillance:

Real-time surveillance videos appear: Tina, the Teenaged Boy
and the Gardener are escorted separately from their
individual cells by Guards down separate hallways:

MRS. JACKSON
Where are they taking them?

0
Arraignment.

HANK
Wait wait wait, they were arrested
separately, right?

MRS. JACKSON
(thinking aloud)
-- taken to different cells, they
haven't been near each other since
they were arrested --

SUSANNA
The kid, look, he's walking fast,
faster than his guard, like he's
rushing toward something --
60.

HANK
The gardener's terrified -- but
she's smiling, smiling again!
Something's about to happen --

SUSANNA
When they're all together --

GILMAN
Interactive agents! They've got
something in their stomachs that's
going to interact when they get
together -- !

MRS. JACKSON
That courtroom at the Federal
Center is a symbol of oppression
to these terrorist groups --

Hank pulls the sketch of Tina dead from his pocket, realizes:

HANK
The bombs are inside them, blocked
from surveillance! They're a bomb!

MRS. JACKSON
Together -- ! When they're all
together!

SUSANNA
You've got to stop them before
they meet in the courtroom -- !

0
(issuing an order:)
Federal Center: Stop the guards,
return prisoners to their cells --

They watch breathlessly as the Guards escorting the three
cell members separately stop, listening to their ear-pieces.

Suddenly, at the same time:

- The Teenaged Boy makes a run for the door to the courtroom.
His Guard tackles him.

- Tina knees her Guard in the groin. He slumps over,
releasing her. She runs toward the door to the courtroom.
He grabs her feet, bringing her down. She tries to crawl to
the door that is only a few steps away --

- The Gardener grabs the gun of his Guard, who is distracted
by the instructions he's listening to. The Gardener shoots
his Guard, and runs to the door to the courtroom --
61.

The Gardener makes it into the courtroom -- but the other two

have been stopped.
THE FAMILY
breathes a sigh of relief. It's over.
0
You just saved hundreds of lives
and denied the terrorists a huge
symbolic victory.

HANK

is congratulated by the Family. He can't help but be proud.

DISSOLVE TO:
INT. HOLLOWAY HOUSE - HANK'S BEDROOM - DAY
Hank is unpacking when Susanna comes in:

SUSANNA
We just got the debrief. They had
swallowed chemical agents, they
would have mixed through the
air -- the charge would've taken
out a half-mile.

HANK
The chemicals could mix through
their skin?

SUSANNA
Skin is porous...

She takes his hand. He tenses up.

SUSANNA
I don't bite.

HANK
(covering with a joke)
You're my sister.

SUSANNA
(seductively)
We're a very tight family.

HANK
What happened to Stan?
62.

SUSANNA
(frightened)
He was promoted.

HANK
To what?

SUSANNA
(dare she tell him
the truth?)
. To Glory.
She leaves.

Hank lifts a photo of Val out of his suitcase. He's startled
to find something taped to the back of it:

It's a business card, for the MIDTOWN SAUNA.

 

0 (V.0.)
(in Hank's earwig,
startling Hank)
Could you step into the family
room, please, Hank?

Hank slips the business card into his pocket.
CUT TO:
INT. HOLLOWAY FAMILY ROOM - DAY

Video and photos of the Family's new assignments fill the
wall screens as O briefs them via video hologram:

0
-- with this chip and wiring
implanted in a paraplegic's brain,
he can move his prosthetic arm by
just thinking about it.

MRS. JACKSON
Surveillance of the research
facility doesn't show who stole
the chip?

0
The chip wasn't stolen from the
facility -- it was stolen from the
subject of the experiment --

Video of a dead paraplegic whose head has been sliced open.
0
-- at a time when he was off
surveillance. We've upgraded our
systems so they can see through
condiments, but we still have a
problem with steam.

63.

Hank fingers the business card for the Sauna in his pocket.

 

0
We need you to tell us what uses
terrorists might make of the
chip -- that should help us find
the people who stole it.

GILMAN
They could build an army of robots
controlled by thought, which can't
be traced --

0
Yes, that's an application we have
envisaged. But what uses might it
have in the hands of evil-doers
that we haven't imagined?

The Family kicks into gear, pulling up video, etc.

-- except

for Hank, who shoves the sauna card deeper into his pocket:

HANK
I'd like to take a couple of hours
off -- I'm not really useful
unless I "get involved" with the
subject, right? And since you
don't know who the subject is
yet...

0
(with a smile)
We know how to find you.

Hank heads for the front door --
0
Hank -- how did you know about the
mayonnaise?
HANK

(covering alarm)
. What?
64.

0
McMahon's Mayonnaise -- how'd you
know it was impenetrable to
surveillance?

HANK

I didn't know, I figured it out.

0
Pretty big leap.

HANK
. That's what you hired me for.

He leaves.
CUT TO:
INT. MIDTOWN SAUNA - DAY

Hank, wearing a towel around his waist, pads through the
sauna, not sure what he's looking for.

He heads into the steam room...
INT. STEAM ROOM - DAY

Hank sits in the steam room with a couple of other guys in
towels. The steam gets thicker and thicker -- the other guys
get uncomfortable and leave one by one.

Finally, Hank can't take it. He heads for the door -- to
find REB suddenly beside him, in a towel, carrying a gym bag:

REB
Congratulations.

HANK
For what? Stopping three of your
comrades?

REB
They weren't our comrades. They
were blood-thirsty murderers.

HANK
And you're better than that.

REB
There are many groups working
against the State who want to
create fear and terror so that
they can rule.

(more)
REB (cont'd)
They would overthrow one set of
tyrants for another. We're the
only group fighting to turn this
country back to the people. we
don't believe in symbolic

violence --

HANK
No, you like your murders more
specific -- like Val.

REB

I told you, she isn't dead.

HANK
How do you know that? Cause your
group or whatever the hell you
are, you're the ones holding her?

REB
No. But we can help you find her.

HANK
That's what you got me here to
tell me? Bring her to me, then
we'll talk.
Hank gets up to leave --

REB
Your parents believe in our cause.

That stops Hank:

HANK
Believe? You mean, believed.

Reb doesn't say anything.

HANK
My parents are dead.

REB
I was with your father when he was
killed --

HANK

They died in a car accident --

REB
He died fighting for the cause.

Reb reaches into his gym bag:
66.

REB
She didn't want to do this --
Hank eyes on Reb's hands -- what's he taking out of the bag?
REB

You knowing that she's alive makes
it more dangerous for all of us...

Reb hands Hank an old, much treasured folded piece of paper.
Hank, his hands trembling, unfolds it...

It's a child's finger-painting of a sunflower.

 

Hank cuts his eyes, misty from steam or tears, up to Reb:
REB
Our group has a name: We are the
resistance fighters of The Free
Republic.
OFF HANK --

BLACKOUT.
