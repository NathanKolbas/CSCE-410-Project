EXT. HARBOR - DAY

The South American harbor is crammed with freight ships.
DOCKWORKERS climb the ramps with bags of coffee beans.
Cranes unload boxes of Japanese coffeemakers.

CUT TO:
EXT. BAR DISTRICT - DAY

The narrow street is lined with garish bars. Half-nude
HOOKERS lean over balconies and call down to passing
SHIPMATES. More hookers, escaping the tropical heat,
sit in doorways and fan themselves to the Salsa MUSIC
from all the bars.

CUT TO:
INT. RESTAURANT PATIO - DAY

Tapping to the music are a man's feet in sandals and a
gold ankle chain. His linen trousers are rolled up in
the heat. Dyed in his silk shirt are small faces of
Rita Hayworth.

He is LEWIS MOLINA, 58, an American who has lived here
since jumping ship at 19. His hair is tinted to hide
the gray. He has the weathered face of a man who has
seen it all, and been hurt by most of it.

As the camera moves from his feet to his face, we hear
Molina reading in a rather effeminate voice.

MOLINA
He says he can't come back for
Christmas like he promised ... and
he's very sorry he hasn't seen his
new son yet... and he loves you
with all his heart.

Spread across his table are envelopes and stamps. A
WOMAN of the district listens to him with quiet dignity.
She has a baby on her lap and a four-year-old boy at her
side.

WOMAN
So he won't come at all this year.

WOMAN (CONT'D)
(holds back tears)
What about money for the children?

MOLINA
Sorry.

He doesn't say.

(turns to bar)
Gabriel! Did you forget my iced
tea?
(turns to woman)
Do you want to write him back?

The woman is too sad to answer. The boy fiddles with
his Star Wars toy. Molina moistens a pen with his tongue
and begins to write.

MOLINA
Dear Peter, the boys and I were
delighted to get your thoughtful
card ...

A ship horn BLARES over the music. As Molina writes, we
see the interior of his hang-out and 'office.'

The restaurant is divided by a folding partition, painted
with jungle leaves and spider webs. One side is a bar
with weary dockworkers. The other side is a modest dining
room with SHIPS OFFICERS at clean tablecloths.

GABRIEL, 35, a handsome waiter in a tunic, moves through
the tables with a tray of dirty dishes. His well-dressed
WIFE, waiting impatiently at the kitchen window, resumes
her harangue.

WIFE
I told you last week, the deadline
is today. If we don't pay by 5:30,
the girls will miss a whole
semester.

Saying nothing, Gabriel puts an iced tea on his tray.
WIFE

Are you listening!

WIFE (CONT'D)
You know how I struggled to get
them accepted by that school!

Gabriel approaches Molina's table on the patio. Molina
glances up with a smile.

GABRIEL
Your tea, Molina. Sorry it took
so long.

MOLINA
That's okay.

(returns to letter)
Remember, dearest Peter, I am your
woman, who misses you more than
life itself, who lives only for
the blessed moment of your return.
I save all my love for you alone.
Your beloved --

(looks up)

What was your name, darling?

WOMAN
Please, Senhor Molina. I will
sign my own name.

Molina is miffed.

MOLINA
Okay. If you think that's better.

The woman pays the fee and leaves. Gabriel, waiting
nearby, looks uneasy as he leans forward.

GABRIEL
Molina, could I ask you a small
favor? It's only a hundred. For
my kid's school. (indicates wife)
She has the money, but she says a
father should provide these things.

Molina takes out a hundred, leaving only twenty for
himself. Gabriel accepts it with grateful dignity.

GABRIEL
Thank you, Molina. I'll pay you
back next month.

Molina watches him approach his angry wife.

MOLINA
Bitch.

CUT TO:
EXT. BAR DISTRICT - NIGHT

Although the bars are closed, the narrow street still
swelters in the heat. Molina and Gabriel stroll past
hookers lingering in the shadows.

MOLINA
I'll never understand. How can a
man with your intelligence work in
a dump like that?

GABRIEL
It's life, Molina.

MOLINA
No, it's a shame. With your looks
and charm, you should work in a
chic restaurant. Ina big
international hotel. Making three
times what you get in that
stinkhole.

GABRIEL
You think I haven't tried?

They turn a corner and approach the bus-stop.

MOLINA
Look, when I brought my mother
down from Miami, she worked the
switchboard at the Copacabana
Palace. She still knows the
manager. She'll introduce you,
and poof. A new life.

GABRIEL
Forget it, Lewis. I can't even
speak English.

The bus approaches.

MOLINA
(quickly)
I'll pay for your lessons. We can
practice everyday. It's perfect,
you'll learn in no time.

GABRIEL
Talk is cheap, eh Molina?

MOLINA
I can afford it. Really.

GABRIEL
(boards the bus)
See you tomorrow.

MOLINA
Goodnight, Gabriel. Kiss the
children for me.

Molina watches the bus pull away. Several TOUGH TEENAGERS
stand in front of a run-down movie theater. One BOY,
16, stares at Molina. Their eyes meet.

CUT TO:
INT. MOLINA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Molina, exhausted, enters his dimly-lit parlor. The
late-night TV broadcasts a test pattern. His MOTHER,
81, wakes up on the sofa. They speak in English.

MOLINA
Mama, you should be in bed. Why
don't you listen to the doctor?

MOTHER
What time is it?

MOLINA
Long past your bedtime. Come,
I'll help you.

He takes her elbow. She hobbles toward her bedroom with
a cane.

MOLINA
Do you know anyone who teaches
English?

MOTHER

Why are you so late, Lewis? Did
something happen?

MOLINA
Of course not, Mama. Just go to
sleep.
EXT. BAR/RESTAURANT - DAY
CUT TO:
Molina sips coffee at his regular "desk" on the patio.

A police car pulls to a stop. A POLICE OFFICER gets out
and approaches Molina's table.

OFFICER
Good morning, Molina. How's it
going?

MOLINA
Not bad.

The officer sits down and fingers Molina's papers and
pens.

OFFICER
How's business?

MOLINA
Slow.

I need more coffee. You want some?

OFFICER
You don't have time.
(points)
Recognize the kid in the car?

Molina squints at the police car. In the backseat is
the 16-year-old boy (from last night) with his FATHER.
Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org 7.

OFFICER
His father's been singing your
favorite song. Let's go.

Crestfallen, Molina stands up and gazes back into the
restaurant at Gabriel.

CUT TO:
EXT. PRISON - DAY

The old prison is massive. The stone walls are surrounded
by slums.

CUT TO:
INT. PRISON - DAY

The corridors are filthy. The floors are cracked. The
paint is peeling.

CUT TO:
INT. TORTURE ROOM - DAY
Shadows on the wall show a man being tortured. He
suddenly falls to the floor. His boots are spattered
with blood.

VOICE A
Is he dead?

VOICE B
No, I'll wake him up.

VOICE A
Forget it, I'm too tired. Just
haul him back to the cell.
CUT TO:
INT. CELL - NIGHT
The stark cell door has a steel door and one small window

with bars. Molina sits on a prison bed and speaks
directly into the camera.

MOLINA
When the tycoon discovers where
she is working, he buys the hotel
and fires her. Just when she needs
to pay for her lover's T.B.
treatment.

CUT TO:
INT. FISHERMAN'S SHACK - NIGHT (MEXICAN MOVIE)

We see the MOVIE that Molina is describing. The images
look like a cheap Mexican melodrama.

The tubercular YOUNG MAN is asleep on a humble bed in
the shanty.

VOICE OF MOLINA
She tells her lover nothing about
losing her job. She just wants
him to sleep.

CUT TO:
INT. CELL- NIGHT

Now we see that Molina is addressing someone. The CAMERA
PANS to the other bed.

His CELL-MATE wears the same blood-spattered boots seen
in the torture room. The CAMERA CONTINUES from boots to
head. The cell-mate appears to be sleeping, his face to
the wall.

MOLINA (0.S.)
She doesn't dare worry him when
he's so sick.

The cell-mate rolls over with his eyes open. He is
VALENTIN ARREGUI, 32, thin and unshaven. His arms show
the marks of torture. He has the intense look of a man
who has been hurt in more ways than one.

VALENTIN
Don't bother me. I need to sleep.

INT. FISHERMAN'S SHACK - NIGHT (MEXICAN MOVIE)

Coughing, the tubercular Young Man struggles to his feet
and puts on his coat.

VOICE OF MOLINA
One night her lover is feeling a
little better and decides to meet
her after work at the hotel.

Leaving, the young man blows out the candle.
CUT TO:

EXT. HOTEL - NIGHT (MEXICAN MOVIE)

The Young Man speaks to the DOORMAN at the large hotel.
The Doorman gives him a cigarette and matches.

VOICE OF MOLINA
The doorman tells him that she
hasn't worked there for quite a
while. He asks for a cigarette
even though he knows smoking is
suicide for a man with T.B.

CUT TO:

EXT. DARK STREET - NIGHT (MEXICAN MOVIE)

The gaunt Young Man sees several PROSTITUTES under a
street lamp, calling out to passing cars.

VOICE OF MOLINA
In desperation he walks street
after street until, finally, he
sees her on a corner. She is
wearing a gaudy outfit and flirting
with an old man in acar. He
suddenly realizes what she's been
hiding from him: she was selling
her body to save his life.

The young man, crying, takes a deep drag on his cigarette.

INT. CELL - NIGHT

Molina, playing the role of the young man, pretends to
cry with a cigarette. Valentin struggles to his feet
and goes to the shit-bucket in the corner.

MOLINA
Do you like it?

VALENTIN
Leave me alone, man. I need to
build my strength.

MOLINA
Just tell me if you like it.

Valentin, exhausted by torture, leans against the wall
as he urinates.

VALENTIN
Now that it's over, it seems like
the lovers are dead.

MOLINA
It's not over yet, my dear.

 

VALENTIN
Shit.

CUT TO:
INT. FISHERMAN'S SHACK - NIGHT (MEXICAN MOVIE)

The WOMAN (who was dressed as a hooker) arrives home in
normal clothing. Seeing his empty bed, she rushes into
the kitchen.

On the table are a plate full of cigarette butts and an
empty bottle of rum. Then she sees his note by the
window.

VOICE OF MOLINA
Instantly she realizes that he
knows her secret. She finds his
note by the window.

VOICE OF MOLINA (CONT'D)
Moonlight falls on his tearstained
words as she reads: "I love you so
much that I cannot go on being
such a burden to you. Please don't
look for me. If God wants us to
meet again, we'll find each other
without even looking."

The movie music swells: a sad, romantic BOLERO.
CUT TO:
INT. CELL - NIGHT

Molina is humming the same Bolero. Valentin stares at
the ceiling.

MOLINA
Isn't it wonderful!

VALENTIN
It helps pass the time.

MOLINA
Does that mean you like it?

SVALENTIN
It doesn't help the cause.

MOLINA
Blessed Mary, is that all you can
talk about? You must've studied
Political Philosophies in school.

Valentin looks at him with disgust.

VALENTIN
The Phrase is Political Science,
and the answer is -- no, I studied
Journalism.

MOLINA
Ah! So you can appreciate a good
story.

VALENTIN

And easily spot a cheap one.

MOLINA
Don't worry, my dear. Tomorrow
morning Mother will show her best.
Better than any movie you'll ever
see.

VALENTIN
No, I can't be listening to this
junk during the day. I've got
important things to think about.

MOLINA
Tomorrow night, then. Sweet dreams.

INT. CELL - DAY

Valentin reads a paperback entitled Third World
Economics. Molina, like an actor, uses a mirror and

Tipstick to apply a light rouge on his cheeks.

MOLINA
Tell me about your girlfriend.
You do have one, don't you?

VALENTIN
Leave me alone.

MOLINA
Of course, you do. What's the big
secret? Is she involved ina
scandal?

Valentin glares up from his book.
VALENTIN
It's none of your business.

(turns away)
That's my problem.

INT. CELL - NIGHT

Molina is excited to be telling another movie.

MOLINA
Imagine Paris during the Second
World War, such a wonderfully heroic
time. Proud soldiers march along
the broad avenues in a magnificent
Parade of Liberation.

CUT TO:
EXT. PARIS - DAY

The Parisian skyline. SOUNDS of crowds, military drums,
marching troops.

VOICE OF MOLINA
The air is charged with excitement
as they march under the Arch of
Triumph.

PAN DOWN the Arch of Triumph to reveal columns of NAZI
TROOPS.

VOICE OF MOLINA
Wearing their marvelous uniforms.
So perfect, so clean. Battalions
of totally blonde, invincible
supermen!

Through a series of shots, we move from the parade to an
average French working-class neighborhood.

The images look like a slapdash German film of the 1940's.
More specifically, a Nazi propaganda movie.

VOICE OF MOLINA
Forget what you read in the history
books. The truth is, the French
welcomed the Germans with open
arms.

As two FRENCHMEN unload a truck at a hardware store, a
NAZI CONVOY appears. German troops arrest the two men,
and find others hiding in the cellar. One is shot trying
to escape, the others surrender. They are Jews.
Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org 14.

VOICE OF MOLINA
Oh, there were a few who didn't
appreciate them, but for the most
part, the French cheered because
they were saving France from
disaster and starvation.

WERNER, a handsome Gestapo officer, whispers to an AIDE.
A neighborhood crowd spits on the smugglers. German
troops break open the cargo and distribute the contraband
food. A grateful OLD WOMAN kisses Werner's hand.

A pickup truck stops in an alley and watches the crowd.

VOICE OF MOLINA
A small truck watches from nearby.
Inside are these two French thugs
from the Resistance. The driver
is a hulking cross-eyed Flunky.
His boss is a grimy little Clubfoot.
Their truck is loaded with
delicacies like canned meats and
cognac. These Resistance goons
are shameless black-marketeers.
Simply shameless.

CUT TO:
INT. CELL - NIGHT

Valentin sits up.

VALENTIN
You mean the Nazis are the good
guys? Are you crazy?

MOLINA
So what, it's a movie I saw.

VALENTIN
Are you saying freedom fighters
are bad guys?

Molina, upset, kicks his rather effeminate speech into
overdrive.

I don't explain my movies. It
just ruins the emotion.

 

VALENTIN

This movie's already ruined.

CUT TO:
INT. CABARET NIGHT - NIGHT (NAZI MOVIE)

The Blonde dances in the chorus line. Elegant waiters
move along dimly-lit tables of German officers.

VOICE OF MOLINA
Every night, a ravishing young
chanteuse takes the stage and sings
to an audience filled with the
German High Command.

LENI, a stunning brunette dressed in elegant black,
appears in the spotlight.

VOICE OF MOLINA
She is Leni Lamaison. A Grace
Kelly with the voice of a Piaf.

VOICE OF VALENTIN
Grace who?

VOICE OF MOLINA

Anyway...

(sighs)
The lyrics portray a sweet innocent
nightingale, taken prisoner from
its nest by a fierce brutal eagle.
Can you imagine her courage, singing
this in public during the German
Occupation? And to top it off,
she descends the stage steps and
finishes her song right in front
of Werner's table. Werner! A man
no woman can resist. Totally
heartless. But inside, a volcano.
My God, so gorgeous, so blonde,
and --

(whispers)
the Chief of the Gestapo for all
France.

Leni, singing, moves between tables of Nazi brass who
fidget at her bold lyrics. Werner whispers and gives an
AIDE his name-card engraved with a swastika.

Leni concludes face-to-face with Werner. Their eyes
lock. Silent tension fills the cabaret. Werner rises
slowly and begins to applaud. The audience bursts into
applause.

CUT TO:
INT. CELL - NIGHT

Molina, acting out Werner's applause, is totally immersed
in his movie. Valentin lies in his bunk

MOLINA
(sighs)
Oh, Valentin, this movie is so
wonderful, but I've got to get
some sleep. Do you mind?

Molina waits for Valentin's reaction. Valentin just
stares at the door.

MOLINA
What's the matter?

VALENTIN
Nothing.

MOLINA

Well, something's bothering you.

VALENTIN
I can't understand why they stooped
my interrogation. It's been three
days.

MOLINA
And Mother thought her bedtime
story was helping you feel better.

VALENTIN
Yeah, a big help.

MOLINA
Fine, we'll pick it up tomorrow
night. Isn't is romantic?

Valentin gazes at him with tight-lipped anger.

VALENTIN
Your Nazis are about as romantic
as the fucking Warden. That
bastard's been kicking and sticking
me more days than I can count, and
now I gotta listen to this crap.

MOLINA
I can imagine.

VALENTIN
No, you can't. You really like
those jackboot blondes.

MOLINA
Of course. I'm in love with Werner.
And you know why?
(gestures)
He's hung like a horse.

Valentin grimaces and rolls over, his face to the wall.

VALENTIN
Go to sleep.

MOLINA
What's wrong? Afraid to talk about
sex?

VALENTIN

You really want to know, Molina?
I find you boring. I know you
like a book.

Molina, angry, leans forward on his bed.

is terrific.

With naive hope, Molina picks up a candle to see
Valentin's face more clearly.

MOLINA
You really mean it?

VALENTIN
(looks at him)
Sure, it's better than a tampax
commercial. Let's mindfuck
everybody.

Molina recoils and quickly regroups.

MOLINA
But propaganda is just dandy when
it serves your stinking revolution.

VALENTIN
Now could you know anything about
revolution? You're just a damn
queen.

MOLINA
And how could you know anything if
you're so damn prejudiced?.

Valentin rolls back toward the wall.

MOLINA
Now what? Our liberated journalist
can't even say "no comment"? Has
our freedom fighter run into too
many fights or too many freedoms?

Why do only women get to be

So build your strength. Have some

VALENTIN
No thanks.

MOLINA

Do you really think eating this

weak? That much self-discipline
is ridiculous. Relax. Enjoy what
life offers you.

VALENTIN
When you join the revolution,
there's no time for pleasure.
Gratifying the senses becomes
secondary. The only thing I enjoy
is serving a cause that is noble.

MOLINA
What kind of a cause is that? One

VALENTIN

Molina, you would never understand.
MOLINA
Try me.
VALENTIN

Look, in order to live with myself,
things must change in this country.
Working for that is my only
pleasure. And I can get that
pleasure anywhere, right here in

you want me to spell it out in one
word, I'm a Marxist.

Life is more important that a cup

The room is empty. SOUND of applause.
VOICE OF MOLINA
Leni finishes her last song to
thunderous applause.

She enters and starts to undress. Then she sees the
Clubfoot in the dressing-table mirror.

CLUBFOOT
Your time is up. Where's the map?

Leni says nothing. The Clubfoot pushes aside a rack of
gowns, revealing a SCHOOLBOY bound and gagged.

CLUBFOOT
You've got 48 hours. Or your cousin
will die.

Leni offers the Clubfoot her jewel box.

LENI
Here, take it. Take anything.
Just leave us alone.

CLUBFOOT
You know what I want.

LENI
Why do you do this? You say you
are fighting for France, but
everyone you kill is French!

CLUBFOOT
I didn't start this. They send
our people to the gas chamber every
day. And who puts them on the
train? Your sweet lover!

LENI
That's a lie! He would never do
anything like that.

head.
MOLINA
You see, Valentin? I know who
Werner is.

Valentin rolls over, clutching his stomach. His face is
chalk-white.

VALENTIN
Get me some water.

Molina rushes to kneel beside Valentin's bunk.

MOLINA
What is it? What's wrong?

VALENTIN
I don't know. My stomach.

VALENTIN
Like a bomb exploding.
MOLINA
Mother of God, the same thing I

had.
Molina goes to pour a cup of water.

MOLINA
But when I had it, you thought it
was a joke.

Molina returns with the water. Valentin sits up.

VALENTIN
I think it's the food.
(groans)
Prison food is crap, but this feels
like dead rats and maggots.

Molina hands him the water and walks to the door.

MOLINA
You must go the Infirmary right

No! Stop.

Thank you, Warden. God bless you.

WARDEN
She must be happy to hear you might

MOLINA

She said she sent me some food.
Do you know where it is?

WARDEN
We haven't seen it. I'm sorry.

WARDEN
That's not your worry, Molina.
Worry about your mother.
The Warden motions Molina to leave. He does.

A single meal stands near the food-slot. Molina and

MOLINA
What if it make you worse?

VALENTIN
I've got no choice.

Molina, feeling helpless, watches him eat.

 

VALENTIN
Tastes like dog piss.

MOLINA
So don't eat it.

VALENTIN

If it's another bomb, I hope it

blows this pig-sty to bits.

I'd like to see the whole damn

thing disappear from the earth

Molina leans forward with a smile.

MOLINA

How lucky you are, Cinderella.
Here is the fairy godmother who

INT. WERNER'S BEDROOM - DAY (NAZI MOVIE)

Leni awakes on silk sheets in a giant antique bed. She
reaches for Werner and realizes he is gone.

She notices the bedroom phone off the hook. Curious,
she steps to the window and picks up the receiver.

VOICE OF MOLINA
The mere sound of Werner's voice
makes her smile with adoration.
He is giving orders with crisp
efficiency. When she is about to
hang up, she hears him coldly order
the execution of a dozen French
freedom-fighters.

Leni drops the phone.
Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org 62.

VOICE OF MOLINA
Her smile turns to horror. Her
sand-castle dreams are demolished
by a tidal wave of agony. The sad
beauty of her reflection in the
window is distorted by the raindrops
which resemble her tears. Suddenly,
Werner embraces her and proposes
marriage. Although she agrees,
her heart knows she can never love
a cold-hearted butcher. As he
wipes away her tears, she decides
to avenge her country by stealing
the map.

CUT TO:
INT. WERNER'S CHATEAU - DAY (NAZI MOVIE)

Werner hosts a gathering of German OFFICIALS and WIVES
in the glass-enclosed garden.

Leni is alone in Werner's adjacent office, singing at
the grand piano. As she concludes, the Germans applaud
for an encore.

Leni puts a record on the phonograph. The Germans, again
enraptured, are unaware that her performance is now a
recording. Quickly, Leni finds a key and unlocks Werner's
desk.

As she rifles through papers, Werner's old BUTLER
approaches the office. As he stops to adjust his watch,
Leni finds the map. She slips back to the piano and
resumes singing, just as the Butler enters the office.

CUT TO:
INT. CELL - NIGHT

Molina, acting the part of Leni, kneels at the foot of
Valentin's bed. As if playing a piano, he runs his
fingers along the metal frame.

tears spill onto the piano keys.

The song grows more heart-breaking
as her hands tremble with the agony
of betraying the man she loved.

Valentin suddenly curls up with pain, then relaxes.

VALENTIN
Oh God... it's like nails being
hammered into my guts.
(pause)
That's better. Do me a favor and
stop all this crap about traitors
and betrayal.

Molina, shifting gears, opens his shirt in an effort to
make him laugh.

MOLINA
Leni's heart was beating so fast
that her swelling breasts popped
out of her low-cut gown. Like
luscious hors d'oeuvres on a silver
platter.

Molina uses his lipstick to draw a pair of breasts on
his chest. Valentin chuckles.

VALENTIN
Don't make me laugh. It hurts.

On his knees, Molina scoots around the bed to Valentin's
face.

MOLINA
Help yourself to a nice juicy tit,
senhor. Please have another. The
best places serve them in pairs.

Valentin breaks into laughter. Suddenly, his eyes snap
open in pain. He clutches his pants and nods at the
shit bucket in the corner.

VALENTIN
The bucket! Quick!

Molina dashes to get the bucket. Valentin struggles to
his feet and tugs at his zipper.

Diarrhea fills his trousers. Valentin collapses on the
floor, covering his face in shame.

VALENTIN
Oh no -- !

MOLINA
Are you okay? Holy Mary, what a
smell.

VALENTIN

(groaning)

I'm sorry. You can't imagine how
it hurts.

MOLINA

Of course, I can. Just let it all
out. It can't smell any worse
than it does already.

VALENTIN
(clenched fists)
God, I can't stand this.

Valentin trembles on the floor. Molina, seeing his anger,
stays a few steps away.

MOLINA
You've been through much worse, my
boy. You're the one always saying
take it like a man.

VALENTIN
But the shame. I hate it. I hate
myself.

Valentin unclenches his fists to hide his tears.

MOLINA
What's done is done. Just take
off your trousers and clean up.

Kneeling down, Molina slides off Valentin's soiled
trousers and underpants. He tosses them beside the shit-
bucket and grabs the short stack of folded toilet paper.

MOLINA
Here. Clean yourself.

Valentin struggles to remove the glob from his buttocks.
Molina wipes the brown liquid from his ankles.

Despondent, Valentin stops straining to reach behind his
back. Molina, taking over, cleans his thighs and buttocks
with maternal concern.

VALENTIN
(covering his
face)
Jesus, aren't you disgusted?

MOLINA
No, it breaks my heart to see you
like this. We're almost finished.
There. Now take off your shirt.
The shirttails are soiled.

Sitting up, Valentin removes his shirt. His back is
covered with black-and-blue welts. Molina pulls the
sheet from his own bed and moves to wrap it around
Valentin's naked body.

VALENTIN
No, it'll stink.

Tenderly insistent, Molina helps him struggle to his
feet.

MOLINA
Don't worry. My weekly shower is
tomorrow. I'll have everything
washed by noon. There you are,
just like a papoose.

Molina wraps the bed sheet around him like a toga and
helps him crawl back in bed.

MOLINA
Feel better?

Yes, but I'm so cold.

VALENTIN
Thanks. Go ahead and read it. I
know you've been curious.

MOLINA
No, I detest politics. I only
read love letters.

VALENTIN
They've already censored the
Politics. It's from my girlfriend.

Molina scans the envelope and unfolds the pages.

MOLINA
Her name is Elsa?

VALENTIN
No, that's a false name.

MOLINA
Is her name Marta?

Can you read her writing? She's

I'm such a bastard. I think I
only fell in love with her because
she's upper-class.

MOLINA
Love makes its own laws.

VALENTIN
So does the revolution. We could
only meet when there was a lull in
the struggle. Whenever I was forced
to leave, she suffered every day
until I got back. The same as I
am now.

slowly open.

They are eating breakfast on a glass coffee table. Marta
begins crying softly and tries to conceal it. Valentin,
deeply distressed, steps onto the terrace with his coffee
cup.

VALENTIN (V.0.)
We were trying to build a
relationship without exploitation.
But once again I made her suffer.
Once again, we argued. She, to
forget her fears. Me, to forget
my quilt.

Marta wipes her tears and joins him on the terrace.

VALENTIN
Come here. Kiss me. Things are

Marta moves forward to accept his kiss, then stops.

Valentin stares out the window at the passing slums.

VALENTIN (V.O.)

I wondered why our land was doomed

As a journalist, I was always

His code name was "Americo." He

AMERICO
A little tired.

VALENTIN

You should have left long ago,
Doctor Americo.

AMERICO
I don't know how to live anywhere
else.

This is where I'm needed.

VALENTIN
I keep wondering if it's all worth

trying. Or it will never change.

VALENTIN
But what have your guns
accomplished? Maybe our struggle
is just an impossible dream.

satisfied with things the way they
are.

A train enters the station. Valentin takes a brown
envelope from his pocket.

VALENTIN
Well, good luck. Here's the
passport. Take care of yourself.

They shake hands and Americo boards the train. As it
leaves, Valentin gets on the escalator.

VALENTIN (V.0.)
I wondered what kept him going. I
thought he was wrong, but I had to
respect him. I could see a candle
burning inside him that nothing in
the world could put out. I was
glad I could help him.

Reaching street level, Valentin steps from the station.

Parked nearby is a black car. Plain-clothes AGENTS jump
out with guns. Valentin tries to run but MORE MEN with

guns emerge from another car.

He stops and raises his arms. Grabbing him, they handcuff
his wrists behind his back and push him toward a truck.

Across the street, he SEES: Marta, Rafael and another
MAN are being pulled from a black car and shoved toward
the truck. Agents place a hood over Rafael's head and
shove him inside the truck.

Valentin, grief-stricken, gazes at Marta. As she returns
his gaze, Agents approach Valentin with a hood and put
it on. The SCREEN turns black.

Where is she now?

Valentin covers his eyes with his hand.

VALENTIN

The letter doesn't say. I haven't
heard another word since that day.

(deep breath)
She's probably in prison. Totally
innocent. Her only guilt is loving
me. Loving this half-dead bastard
who made her suffer. I should
just go ahead and die.

MOLINA
Valentin, don't even say that.

Valentin covers his eyes with both hands.

VALENTIN

(tight-lipped)
Since my interrogation began,
there's been another kind of
torturer inside me, who keeps saying
this agony after agony is the last
thing I'll ever feel.

(chokes back tears)
I don't deserve to die in this
cell. I only confessed some code
names they already knew.

MOLINA
Just let it out.

VALENTIN
I can't take being a martyr, it

I don't want to die, Molina. Don't
let me die.
MOLINA
You won't die.

But look at me. What can I do?
MOLINA
Write her a letter. Tell her you

love her.

"Dear Marta. Even if you never
receive this letter, please forgive

me... " No, start over. "I have
no right to ask you to forgive me,
I love..." Start again.

The Warden pushes a Kleenex box across the desk.
WARDEN

We know, Molina. We're sorry it
happened. Have a seat.

Sitting down, Molina uses several tissues to wipe his

nose and dab his eyes.

How can you accuse me when you
know I almost died for you?

WARDEN
Cheer up, Molina. Your mother's
feeling a lot better since hearing
about your pardon. They told me
she's practically a new person.

Molina has to wipe his nose again. Pedro approaches.

Yes, sir. It was personal. A
love letter.

PEDRO
Did you read the part about his
Uncle Americo?

Yes. He went to visit a farm or
something.

PEDRO

That's a code phrase, telling him
Americo has disappeared. How did
he react?

MOLINA
Nothing, sir.

So he was right. He knows that
you'd read it first. He told me.

PEDRO
Of course, you idiot. What did he
say about the new prisoner? The

Dammit, how do you expect him to
talk if he can't even see the
bastard's face?

WARDEN
It won't happen again.

Turning, Pedro sees Molina distracted by the remains of
last month's Christmas tinsel. Again it is difficult to
tell if Molina is really a fool -- or if, always an actor,
he sometimes plays the fool.

From the top of the stairs, the Clubfoot shoots her in

take someone being nice to me

and depressed, and spends
approximately one hour each
afternoon staring out a window
facing south.

Molina remains motionless at the window. His sad eyes
gaze across the city rooftops at the distant prison.

CUT TO:

EXT. RESTAURANT PATIO - DAY

Molina,

unshaven and unkept, sits at his regular table

on the patio. Gabriel serves him coffee.

GABRIEL

You sure you won't eat something?
MOLINA

Just coffee.
GABRIEL

Do you want to talk? Is something

wrong?

Molina sips his coffee and glances at the black sedan

nearby.

MOLINA
No, I just can't see you for awhile.
I'm going away.

GABRIEL
When will you be back?

MOLINA
(glances at sedan)
I don't know.

Just leave me alone.

CUT TO:

INT. MOLINA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Molina gazes out the window from his armchair. The
phonograph plays the same sad BOLERO from his Mexican
movie. He checks his wristwatch, then gets up and leaves,
locking the door.

CUT TO:

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Molina enters a Phone booth. Twice he dials a number,
lets it ring and hangs up.

Swirling around the booth is a mob of Carnival merrymakers
in phantasmagoric costumes. The third time, he speaks
into the phone.

MOLINA
I have a message from Valentin
Arregui.
(pause)
Yes, a pay phone
(glances around)
I think I lost them in the crowd.
(long pause)
Is that necessary?
(short pause)
Okay. I'll be wearing a red scarf.

He hangs up and disappears in the mob.

Molina meets Greta by the duck pond.

GRETA
Darling, what's happened to you?
I've called five million times.
Carnival is finally here, and look
at you! And now you feed me this
dish about a trip?

MOLINA
Greta, darling, I trust you. Please
trust me. I know what I'm doing.
(hands brown
envelope)
For Mama. This will take care of
her while I'm gone. Please.

GRETA
All right, I'll handle it. Wherever
you're going, it's probably for
the best. But please, Louisa, at
least take a bath.
CUT TO:
INT. MOLINA'S BATHROOM - DAY

Molina steps from the steamy shower, checks his wrinkles
in the mirror and dabs shaving cream on his face.

CUT TO:
INT. MOLINA'S LIVING ROOM - DAY
Molina, dressed in his finest, scrutinizes himself ina

INT. HOSPITAL - DAY
Molina sits beside his sleeping mother.

MOLINA

Mama, you look so beautiful.

(whispers)
You remember, Mama, when I was
little and you'd come into my room
to kiss me good-night.

(kisses her cheek)
I always pretended to be asleep,
but I was waiting for your kiss.
Although you're sleeping now, I
know you understand me.

(touches her face)
It's time for me to take care of
my own life. You do understand,
don't you, Mama? Please don't be
sad.

A NURSE approaches.

NURSE
She's been in a coma for two days.

MOLINA
I know. Leave us, please.

He kisses his mother on the forehead.

CUT TO:
INT. BLACK SEDAN - DAY

The black sedan creeps through dense carnival throngs.
Pedro, straining, watches Molina thread his way through
the crowd.

PEDRO (V.O.)

spots Molina turning into a shopping
arcade.

CUT TO:
EXT. ARCADE - DAY

Molina runs along the mall and ducks into a boutique.
Looking in a display mirror, he SEES: the black sedan
stops at the arcade entrance; one MAN gets out; the car
drives away.

CUT TO:
EXT. STREET - DAY

The street is a cacophony of fire-crackers and Samba
bands. Molina pushes through dancing throngs in their
exotic costumes. A costumed STREET PEDDLER tries to
badger him.

PEDDLER
Take home a Grate-All for the little
lady! The great Grate-All grates
anything -- cheese, soap, potatoes,
even your mother-in-law.

Molina pushes an to the edge of the plaza.

CUT TO:
EXT. PLAZA - DAY
Molina sees a young woman step from a car across the
plaza. He hurries forward. She kisses the driver who
pulls away.

Molina stops at the plaza fountain, wipes the sweat from
his face and scans the crowd.

A taxi stops near the fountain. The two passengers are
a YOUNG MAN and YOUNG WOMAN. They smile and wave for
him to approach.

Molina stens forward nervously. He leans toward the
window and sees the Young Man holds a pistol.

YOUNG MAN
Who are you?

MOLINA
I have a message from Valentin.

YOUNG MAN
Get in. Quick.

Molina grabs the doorknob. But the Street Peddler,
leaping forward, plows him aside and thrusts a revolver
in the window.

The Young Man fires two quick shots, twisting the Peddler
sideways and slamming him to the pavement. Molina
stumbles into the stunned crowd.

The taxi bolts away. Undercover Agents rush forward and
shoot rapid-fire at the taxi careening through horrified
merrymakers.

CUT TO:
EXT. ALLEY - DAY

Molina, limping, hurries along the dark alley. Pedro
and three Agents round the corner and chase him with
their guns drawn.

PEDRO
Stop! Molina!

Bystanders scatter. Molina keeps moving. Pedro
rapidfires three shots. Molina blasted twice in the
back, plunges to his hands and knees. Pedro dashes to
catch up.

Molina, gasping, struggles to his feet and staggers along
the dark wall to the sun-lit street.

Pedro's Agents swarm forward and hustle him into the
backseat of a black sedan. As Pedro jumps in, the car
lurches away.

CUT TO:
INT. BLACK SEDAN - DAY

Molina moans on the backseat floor. Pedro straddles his
waist and shouts in his ear.

PEDRO
The phone number. Tell me the
number and you go to the hospital
I As Pedro shakes him, Molina spits
up foamy blood.

PEDRO
The number! Talk, you fucking
fag! Tell me that number!

Molina looks calm. All NOISES fade away. The only SOUND
is his sad bolero and his quiet voice.

VOICE OF MOLINA
What have they done to you,
Valentin?
CUT TO:
EXT. STREET CORNER - DAY

A dog sniffs a pile of slum rubbish. Tires screech; a
car door flings open; a body tumbles onto the rubbish.

The car roars away. The dog returns and sniffs the
corpse. It is Molina.

VOICE OF VALENTIN
What have they done to you, Molina?

CUT TO:
INT. PRISON INFIRMARY - DAY
Valentin, delirious, lies on a cot in the small first

aid room. His face is swollen with bruises. His chest
is disfigured by third-degree burns.

A male INTERN approaches with a hypodermic needle.

INTERN
It's morphine. It'll make it hurt
less, so you can get some rest.
Nod your head if you want it.
(Valentine nods)
Okay, count to forty. Listen,
don't tell about this or I'll lose
my job. God, the way they worked
you over, it's barbaric.
(finishes)
There. It'll ease the pain in
just a minute and you'll be able
to sleep.

VOICE OF VALENTIN
Twenty-nine, thirty, thirty-one,
thirty-uh... thirty...
Valentin smiles slightly. His arm, folded to hold the
cotton-ball, slumps down. His hand is clasped by a
woman's hand.

VOICE OF MARTA
Valentin, don't be afraid.

VOICE OF VALENTIN
Marta.

Her hand tugs his toward the door.
CUT TO:
INT. PRISON CORRIDOR - SURREAL

The prison corridor, like a long tunnel, is strangely
dark with a door of glowing light at the end.

The shadowy nude silhouettes of Valentin and Marta move
toward the light.

VOICE OF MARTA
Come, Valentin, come with me.
Don't be afraid. You won't wake
up in a cell.

The light is filtered through dense jungle plants.

EXT. JUNGLE BEACH - DAY

Their silhouettes push through the shadowy leaves.

Marta

CUT TO:

It

is the same jungle that was in Molina's movie about the

Spider Woman.

VOICE OF MARTA
Hurry, Valentin. They won't find
you here.

VOICE OF VALENTIN
But Molina is dead.

VOICE OF MARTA
Don't be sad, my love. Only he
knows if he died sad or happy.

Still holding hands, they emerge from the jungle and see
the beautiful sun-lit beach with the water-logged rowboat.

Their silhouettes run across the beach into the ocean.

They embrace in the water.

VOICE OF VALENTIN
Don't leave me.

VOICE OF MARTA
Nothing can separate us now.

VOICE OF VALENTIN
Oh how much I love you. That's
the one thing I've never said,
because I'm so afraid of losing
your love forever.

VOICE OF MARTA
That will never happen here. This
dream is short, but this dream is
happy.

They kiss again, then gaze at the sparkling horizon.
