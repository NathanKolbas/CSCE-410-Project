OPENING:

INT. COMMUNITY CENTER - YASMINE’S DANCE STUDIO - DAY 1

The community center is an old run down building with two
floors and several different rooms. Built in the 50’s, it
looks like it hasn't been kept up or painted in years.
Water spots and old creaky floors line the hallway. The
center is housed in a state funded facility with several
other volunteer operations. Juanita’s free clinic and
Yasmine’s Rhythms, a dance studio, are two of them. We
enter the dance studio where Yasmine is dancing alone. We
see soft shots of her hands and feet dancing about the
room. The fabric from her yellow leotard move gracefully
in the wind as she dances to the sound of a solo piano.
The slow speed of the film catches her face in the light
from the huge old dirty window. The entire scene is in a
sepia tone with the yellow very noticeable.

YASMINE (V.O.)
Dark phrases of womanhood,
of never having been a girl.
Half-note scattered without
rhythm.

INT. JUANITA’S APARTMENT — DAY 2

JUANITA a nurse dressed in green and relentless volunteer
stands in the kitchen of her modest apartment watering a
plant. She goes back to her table where she has several
hundred flyers printed. The flyers read, “Free Clinic
Seminars on Thursday”.

JUANITA (V.O.)
No tune distraught. Laughter
fallin’ over a black girl's
shoulders. It’s funny. It’s
hysterical. The melodylessness of
her dance. Don’t tell nobody,
don’t tell a soul. She’s dancing
on beer cans and shingles.

CUT TO:

INT. JOANNA’S APARTMENT - DAY 3

JOANNA a high powered business woman stands in her posh
penthouse apartment high above Manhattan, she is getting
ready for work. Dressed in red, she stands in her closet.
Her husband CARL, in silhouette is in the shower. We see
him in the distance.

Joanna picks his pants up off the floor, a card falls
out. She picks the card up and looks at it, then puts it
back in his pocket.

JOANNA (V.O.)
This must be the spook house.
Another song with no singers,
lyrics no voices and uninterrupted
solos, unseen performances. Are
we ghouls? Children of horror?

CUT TO:

INT. ALICE’S APARTMENT - DAY 4

ALICE a religious fanatic walks to a closet in her small
run down apartment. She sits in her closet and starts
praying. She’s dressed in all white, lighting candles on
a makeshift altar.

ALICE (V.O.)
The joke? Don’t tell nobody, don’t
tell a soul. Are we animals? Have
we gone crazy?

INT. KELLY’S APARTMENT -— DAY 5

KELLY, an overworked social worker, is looking at a
pregnancy test stick in the bathroom of her modest
apartment. It’s negative. She is dressed in blue. DONALD
her husband enters. She quickly puts it in the trash can
and tries to hide her frustration. He kisses her.

KELLY (V.O.)
I can’t hear anything but
maddening screams and the soft
strains of death. And you
promised me. You promised
somebody. Anybody. Sing a black
girl's song.

CUT TO:

INT. HIGH SCHOOL - AUDITORIUM - DAY 6

A graduation is in full swing. We see NYLA dressed in
purple, as she receives her diploma. Her mother ALICE
beams with pride from the front row. Alice is dressed in
all white with a cross on and a huge bible. Her older
sister TANGIE dressed in orange looks uninterested as she
looks at a one of the male teachers making eyes at her.

(CONTINUED)
GOLDENROD REVISED 3.
CONTINUED: 6

NYLA (V.O.) (CONT'D
Bring her out to know herself. To
know you, but sing her rhythms
caring, struggle.

TANGIE (V.O.)
Hard times sing. Her song of life.
She’s been dead so long, closed in
silence so long.

INT. CRYSTAL’S APARTMENT — DAY 7

CRYSTAL lays in the bed in a very run down apartment BEAU
WILLIE is having sex with her. Her brown dress is pushed
up above her thighs. A tear rolls down her face.

CRYSTAL (V.O.)
She doesn’t know the sound of her
own voice, her infinite beauty.
She’s half-note scattered without
rhythm, no tune. Sing her sighs...
Sing the song of her
possibilities. Sing a righteous
gospel. Let her be born. Let her
be born and handled warmly.

CRYSTAL/KELLY /NYLA/TANGIE/JOANNA/
ALICE/JUANITA (V.O.)

And this is for colored girls who

have considered suicide but moved

to the ends of their own rainbows.

CUT TO:

INT. TANGIE’S APARTMENT —- KITCHEN - DAY 8

Tangie sits at the kitchen table of her small urban
apartment. She is writing in her journal. She takes some
orange butterflies out of her hair and put them in a box.
A half-dressed man comes out of the bedroom. We realize
that it’s the same man that she was making eyes with at
the graduation.

MAN #1
You got anything to eat?

TANGIE
You’‘1l have to go now. I've got
lot of work to do and I can’t with
aman around.

She walks over and gives him his pants.

TANGIE (CONT'D)
Here are your pants. There’s
coffee on the stove. It’s been
very nice but I can’t see you

again.
MAN #1
What did you say to me?
TANGIE
You got what you came for. Didn’t

you?
He mumbles as he puts on his pants.
TANGIE (CONT'D)

I couldn’t possibly wake up with
a strange man in my bed.

MAN #1
Is that why you been out here all
night.

TANGIE

Why don’t you go home. I’m sure
your wife is looking for you.

He glares at her for a second.

MAN #1
Yeah, okay.

He walks out and slams the door.

TANGIE
Yes, get your little dick, no
fucking ass, out of here.

EXT. CRYSTAL’S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY 9

Man # 1 walks out the apartment building. Juanita opens
the back door of her car. She is trying to remove a
plant from her backseat. Kelly stands at the door on the
intercom.

KELLY
Hello.
CRYSTAL(V.O.)
Yes.
KELLY
Hi, I’m Kelly Watkins from Child
Welfare.

Kelly walks to the stairway and looks up. Crystal looks
down from the fifth floor.

KELLY (CONT'D)
No elevator?

CRYSTAL
It’s a walk up.

Kelly starts the walk up the stairs. She passes Juanita
holding the plant and standing at a doorway.

JUANITA

JUANITA (CONT'D)

You got a woman in there?
Franklin. You know what...Fine
Frank. Fine, I’ve had enough of
this, I'm sick of your shit and
Without any assistance or guidance
from you I have loved you
assiduously for eight months, two
weeks and a day. I have been stood
up four times. I’ve left seven
packages on your doorstep, forty
poems, two plants and three
handmade note cards. And I left
town so I could send them. You
have been no help to me on my job.
You call at 3:00 in the morning on
weekdays. Charming, charming. But
you are of no assistance. I want
you to know this was an experiment
to see how selfish I could be. If
I could really carry on, to snare
a possible lover. If I was capable
of defacing myself for the love of
another. If I could stand not
being wanted when I wanted to be
wanted. And, I cannot so, with no
further assistance and no guidance
from you. I am ending this affair.

She reaches into her purse and takes a note card. She
sticks it into the plant.

JUANITA (CONT'D)
There’s a note that is attached to
a plant I've been watering since
the day I met you. You may water
it your damn self.

CRYSTAL
Sure I’ll get it.

Apartment 515 door opens Tangie sweeps dust into the
hallway.

GILDA
You’re gonna clean that up.

TANGIE
It's dust. It will blow away.

GILDA
Everything don’t blow like you.
You got a lot of men coming
through your house.

TANGIE
Why you jealous cause you don’t
have no men COMING at all. Mind
your business.

Tangie turns to go into her apartment.

TANGIE (CONT'D)
Your old ass better leave me
alone. You have been the bain of
my existence since they voted you
apartment manager.

Tangie goes into the house and slams the door.

GILDA
I can’t stand that girl. Just a
tramp.

CRYSTAL
I told the doctor that she was
fine. It’s just a little bruise.

Kelly looks around the small but neat apartment. Crystal
gives her a glass of water.

KELLY
Thank you. I understand that but,
any time a child is repeatedly
seen in an emergency room, we have
to do a home visit. Where are your
children?

Crystal goes into the small bedroom. Kelly sees cigarette
smoke and feet hanging from a bed in the bedroom. She can
hear a very loud TV. Crystal comes out with the kids and
closes the door.

KELLY (CONT'D)
Is that the children's father?

CRYSTAL
Yes.

Kelly looks at the kids.

KELLY (CONT'D)

My name is Kelly. I like your
shirt. Can you talk to me for a
second? Do you remember when you
went to see the doctor the other
day? How did you hurt yourself?

Beau Willie comes out of the room.

BEAU WILLIE
Who is this?

KELLY
I’m Kelly Watkins from Child
Welfare.

BEAU WILLIE
Child welfare?

KELLY
Yes.

BEAU WILLIE
Damn Government. I called them
months ago to get veterans
benefits. I can’t get a case
worker. How the fuck the
government gonna send you down
here about some kids? I been
asking them bastards. I defended
this damn country, so you can have
that job, and they send you down
here with this bullshit. Get the

know. I can hear everything
through this wall. That's why I
called you.

KELLY
You called.

GILDA
Yes. She can’t protect them from
him. Ever since he came back from
the war he’s been crazy. And he
drinks like a fish. Do her a favor
take them children. He came home
crazy as hell and tried to get
veterans benefits to go to school
& they kept right on puttin’ him
in remedial classes. He couldln’t
read wortha damn, so Beau cussed
the teachers of holdin him back &
got himself a gypsy cab to drive,
but his cab kept breakin down and
the cops was always messin wit
him. Crystal went and got pregnant
again and Beau most beat her to
death when she told him, she still
gotta scar under her right tit
where he cut her up. Still Crystal
went right on and had the baby, so
now Beau Willie has two children,
a and there waz no air.

Beau Willie opens the door. Gilda quickly closes her
door. Kelly walks down the stairs. She can almost feel
Beau Willie staring at her. She looks back at Beau
Willie. She hurries out.

You do this to taunt me. You are
just as evil as my father was.
Just evil.

TANGIE
Granddaddy put me in charge of his
little will because he knew you
would give all of it to that
cult.

ALICE
It’s not a cult. You would know
that if you came and spent some
time at the Temple of Elohim.

TANGIE
I'm not giving you any money.

ALICE
You will burn in hell child.

TANGIE
Why is it when I give you money
I’m blessed of Elohim and when I
don't I'm going to burn in hell?

ALICE
I pray for you that you find God
through the mist of the distances
that Satan has put in your heart.
He has lured you to him through
deception, through the dark

BILL
That's great.

He looks at her for a second.

YASMINE

BILL
Everyday since I met you two weeks
ago we walk this route. I go to

Bobby Mills, Martin, Jerome, Sammy
Yates, Eddie Jones and Randy. All

and ladies in heat. We rambled
from Camden to Mount Holly
laughing at the afternoon's
speeches. Our tassels dangling
from the rear view mirror.

Nyla stretches.

backseat of his old Buick. And
girl Bobby started looking at me.
Yeah, he started looking at me
real strange. Like I was a woman
or something and started talking
real soft in the backseat. By the
time the sun was coming up I
couldn't stop smiling.

Yasmine walks in.

GIRL #1
You gave it up in a Buick?

YASMINE
You better be talking about a ride

Joanna clears her throat. Katina hands her some tea.

JUANITA
Hi. Juanita Simms.

JOANNA
Hi. What can I do for you?

JUANITA
I’m so glad that you took this
meeting. I’1l be quick because I
know you're really busy. I was
reading in your magazine about
your upbringing and I just knew...

Joanna seems to not be paying attention to her.

JUANITA (CONT'D)
You would respond to this program.
I’m a nurse and I started a free

JUANITA (CONT'D)
We never had health care or even
talked about it. So I just wanted
to educate women on their bodies
and at the same time their mind
and souls. You and me both were
raised by single mothers so I know
how that is.

JOANNA
That's great. Where do I come in?

Juanita hands Joanna a flyer, placing it on top of the
document that she was distracted with. The two woman look
at each other oddly for a second.

JUANITA
Well this is just a little
nonprofit. And everything I've
been doing, I've been doing on my
own, out of my pocket, you know we
get a small donation here and
there.

JOANNA
Let me stop you, I give to Cancer,
I give to Education, I give to
Africa. Those are my charities of
choice.

JUANITA
And those are all great causes but
there is so much need right here
in our own community.

JOANNA
Our community, I think that we've
all been afforded the same
opportunities in this country and
if these women, these people
didn't do anything with their
opportunities, it’s not my issue.
I’m afraid I’m going to have to
say no. Thank you.

sons whistlin to the store for
fatback and black-eyed peas. You
glittered in heat and seemed to be
lookin for rides when you wazn’t

wazn’t lame, white, or noddin out.
Look at you. You let your thigh
slip from under your skirt crossin
the street. You slowed to be
examined. I saw you I watched you
sullen. And the rhinestones
etching the corners of your mouth
suggested tears fresh kisses that
had done no good. You always wore
your stomach out lined with small
iridescent feathers. The hairs
round your navel seemed to dance
and you didn’t let on that you
knew from behind your waist waz
aching to be held.

TANGIE
You don't know me, I am not
a deliberate coquette who never

wanted to be unforgettable. I
wanted to be a memory, a wound to

me. I am the wrath of women in
windows fingerin shades. 01 lace

prey to the dazzle of hips painted

thighs. And had planned on leavin
before dawn. And you had been so
divine devastatingly bizarre the
way your mouth fit round. And now
you stand a regular colored girl
fulla the same malice livid
indifference as a sistah worn from
supportin a would-be horn player.
But then you gather your tinsel
and jewels from the tub. And laugh
gayly or vengeful you stored your
silk roses by your bed. And when
you finished writin the account of
her exploit in a diary embroidered
with lilies and moonstones. You
place the rose behind your ear and
cried yourself to sleep.

JOANNA
Yes dammit, be a man instead of
that fucking kid that I've been
taking care of.

CARL
Joanna stop it.

JOANNA
What kind of man marry's a woman
then sneaks around and around
letting another man bend him over.

CARL
Nobody bends me over?

JOANNA
So you do the bending.

CARL
You wanna know what I am? I'ma
man that is sick of your shit. I’m
not going to wake up next to a
man, kiss him and hold him. That
ain't me, holding hands some mans
hand walking down the street
that's a gay man, that ain't me.

JOANNA
What are you saying?

CARL
I'm a man that can enjoy sex with
aman. No attachments it’s just
sex. And I’m sorry if you can’t
handle my truth.

JOANNA
Save your sorry. One thing I
don't need is any more apologies.
I got sorry greeting me at my
front door. You can keep yours. I
don’t know what to do with them.
I'm gonna have to throw some away
I can’t get to the clothes in my
closet for all the sorries. I'm
gonna tack a sign on my door,
leave a message by the phone. If
you called to say you’re sorry,
call somebody else. I don't use
‘em anymore. I let sorry, didn’t
mean to, and how could I know
about that take a walk down a dark
and musty street in Brooklyn.

JOANNA (CONT'D)
I'm gonna do exactly what I want
to and I won’t be sorry for none
of it. Let a sorry soothe your
soul. I'm gonna soothe mine. You
were always inconsistent doing
something and then being sorry.
Beating my heart to death talking
bout you sorry. Well I will not
call, I'm not going to be nice. I
will raise my voice, scream and
holler, break things and race the
engine and tell all your secrets
bout yourself to your face. I
won't be sorry for none of it. I
loved you on purpose I was open on
purpose. I still crave
vulnerability and loose talk. I'm
not even sorry bout you being
sorry. You can carry all the guilt
and grime ya wanna just don't give
it to me. I can’t use another
sorry. Next time you should admit
you’re mean, down low and low
down, trifling. And no count
straight out. Instead of being
sorry all the time, enjoy being
yourself. When I get back I want
you gone and take your HIV with
you.

She puts her test results down in front of him and walks
out the door.

INT. COMMUNITY CENTER - YASMINE’S RHYTHMS - NIGHT 116
Yasmine is dancing with all of the girls, Nyla is dancing
happy. There is a huge congratulations banner hanging
above the DJ. Alice comes in. Tangie goes over to her,
dancing up on her. Alice seems very uncomfortable.

TANGIE
What’s up Alice?

ALICE
I bought you some things for her.

She gives her a box.

TANGIE
Is it ticking?

Come on.
Alice walks up to Nyla.
ALICE

I'm very proud of you. Elohim
blessed. Here?

NYLA
Yes he did.
ALICE
It’s the temple bible.
NYLA
Thank you mamma. You want some
food?
ALICE

No, I'm fasting, I’m going to go
now. This music is of the devil.

She walks out.

TANGIE
Bye.

JOANNA

I don't know what’s worse the
betrayal or the virus.

JUANITA
HIV is not a death sentence. I
have patients that have been on
their meds living a great life for
over twenty years. Its gonna be
ok.

JOANNA
I can’t believe I was that stupid.

JUANITA
Honey, it could have been any of
us. You were not stupid you were
in love. We deal with emotion too
much.

JUANITA (CONT'D)
So why don’t we go on ahead and be
white then and make everything dry
and abstract with no rhythm and no
feeling for sheer sensual
pleasure. Yes let’s go on and be
white. We’re right in the middle
of it. No use holding out holding
onto ourselves. Let’s think our
way outta feeling. Let’s abstract
ourselves some families and maybe
tonight. I’11 find a way to make
myself come without him. No
fingers or other objects just
thought, which isn’t spiritual
evolution.

JOANNA
Thinking won’t do me a bit of good
tonight. I need to be loved. And
haven't the audacity to say where
are you?

JUANITA
And don’t know who to say it to.

The ladies come up the stairs.

Gilda and

NYLA
Look who’s here.

Crystal come in. The other women follow her up.

TANGIE

What are you doing up here?
JOANNA

There was no air.
KELLY

Are you having a good time?
JOANNA

Yes I am.
KELLY

How about you?

TANGIE
Surprisingly I am. I usually need
a man around to have some fun.

JUANITA
No, let them stay where they are.
My love is too beautiful to have
thrown back on my face.

YASMINE
Oh, I like that.
JUANITA
Try one.
YASMINE
What?
JUANITA
I do this with the class. We say
my love is too..., you fill that
part in.
GILDA

My love is too sanctified to have
thrown back on my face.

KELLY
My love is too magic to have
thrown back on my face.

TANGIE
My love is too Saturday night to
have thrown back on my face.

JOANNA
My love is too complicated to have
thrown back on my face.

YASMINE
My love is too music to have
thrown back on my face.

JUANITA
And you remember that the next
time some man tries to walk away
with all your stuff.

TANGIE
I know that’s right. Or says I'm
sorry a million times.

KELLY
We all got I’m sorry stories don't
we.

JUANITA

Get this, last week my ex came in
saying,”I don’t know how she got
your number baby”. I’m sorry.

TANGIE
No this one is it. “Oh, baby, ya
know I was high. I’m sorry.”

KELLY
I’m only human, and inadequacy is
what makes us human. And if we
was perfect we wouldn’t have
nothing to strive for. So you
might as well go on and forgive me
cause I’m sorry.

GILDA
No this one is it. I do ya like I
do ya cause I thought ya could
take it. No, I’m sorry.

JOANNA
Now I know that you know I love
ya, but I ain’t ever gonna love ya
like ya want me to love ya. I’m

sorry.

CRYSTAL
Shut up bitch, I told you I was
sorry.

All the women look at her and get serious for a second.
This is the first time we notice that the women are
wearing the same colors as they were in the beginning
red, orange, purple, yellow, green and brown.

CRYSTAL (CONT’D)
It’s ok. I asked myself how I
could let that happen and I
realized that I was missing
something. Something so important.
Something promised. A laying on of
hands Fingers near my forehead
Strong. Cool. Moving. Makin me
whole. Sense. Pure. All of God
coming into me laying me open to
myself. I was missing something.

JOANNA
Something promised.

JUANITA
Something free.

CRYSTAL
A laying on hands.

TANGIE
I know bout’ laying on bodies,
laying outta man.

TANGIE (CONT'D)
Bringing him all of my fleshy self
and some of my pleasure being
taken full eager wet like I get
sometimes. I was missing
something.

CRYSTAL
A laying on of hands.

TANGIE
Not a man. Laying on.

NYLA
Not my Mama, holding me tight,
saying I'm always gonna be her
girl.

GILDA
Not a laying on of a bosom and
womb a laying on of hands the
holiness of myself released.

CRYSTAL
I sat up one night walking my
apartment floors screaming,
crying. The ghost of another
woman who was missing what I was
missing I wanted to jump outta my
bones and be done with myself.
Leave me alone and go on in the
wind. It was too much. I fell into
a numbness til the only tree I
could see took me up in her
branches held me in the breeze.
Made me dawn dew that chill at
daybreak the sun wrapped me up
swingin rose light everywhere the
sky laid over me like a million
men. I was cold. I was burnin up.
A child and endlessly weaving
garments for the moon with my
tears I found God in myself and I
loved her I loved her fiercely.
