EXT. NORTHEASTERN INDUSTRIAL CITY = DAY

CAMERA PANS a modern cityscape on a fall afternoon in
1981. A rejunvenated downtown core, all glass and

steel, eventually reveals a faded garment district, a
warehouse area in decline and finally an old city

market. The colorful marketplace, bustling with commerce,.
is the heart of a working class neighborhood created —

by the melting pot.

EXT. OLD CITY MARKET = INDUSTRIAL CITY - DAY

As the CAMERA TRAVELS we see a young MODERN PRIEST
engaging two HASSIDIC RABBINICAL STUDENTS in animated
conversation beside an aging synagogue. A Roman
Catholic church, younger than the synagoque by two
decades, stands directly across the street. Immigration
Cycles have shaped this distincly American neigh-
borhood; a Kosher poultry market sits beside a
Portuguese fresh fish stand; an Italian groceteria
beside a Greek bakery. In a nearby park, widows in
black socialize on benches while watching their grand-
children at play. Homes built for cold climates

but paintea tropical colors surround the park.
CAMERA HOLDS on a three-story brick house under
renovation.

EXT, RENOVATED HOUSE = MARKET NEIGHBORHOOD = DAY

An air compressor is pumping air through a sand pot.
Three blast hoses snake up to three sandblasters on
hydraulic decks at the third-floor level of the house.
Other members of the renovation crew surround the
machinery. CLOSE on one sandblaster working on the
brick facade. JUNIOR JEAN, 18, an electrian's helper,
is below the sandblaster, sitting on the ledge of

a second-floor window, She takes a drill from her
toolbelt and starts drilling. FRANK, 24, her boy-
friend and boss, is standing beside his van --
“United Electrical Systems." He shouts over the noise
toward JUNIOR JEAN.

FRANK
Hey, Jean!...Don't forget
the ionizer...Okay?

JEAN nods. Puts down her drill as the hydraulic deck
above her begins to descend. The sandblaster is
wearing a protective suit and helmet visor. CLOSE
on helmet as it’s removed, Long, black hair tumbles
out. RAVEN, 8 remarkably beautiful girl of 19,
descends, passing in front of JEAN, who is drilling
again. RAVEN waves at JEAN as the platform heads
toward the ground.

EXT. RENOVATED HOUSE = MARKET NEIGHBORHOOD = DAY

RAVEN walks toward the crew trailer parked in the
driveway. Slips out of her protective suit to reveal

a tight pair of painter's overalls. She has a bell-~boy
on her hip. Sits on the steps of the trailer and takes
her work boots off. She's slipping into a pair of high~
fashion stiletto boots as FRANK approaches.

RAVEN
You like my new boots?
FRANK . .
Real nice.

RAVEN
Seventy bucks. They're
Quinto's.

FRANK
You going to be around later?

Moment when RAVEN looks up at JUNIOR JEAN drilling.
FRANK glances up toward JEAN and back to RAVEN. RAVEN
stands, grabs a large pink tote bag that's packed
with personal belongings and admires her boots.

RAVEN
I dunno Frankie...Supercute
boots, aren't they?

RAVEN in a rush starts to leave, waves up to JUNIOR
JEAN.

FRANK
I guess me and Junior Jean will
see you over at the bar later.

RAVEN nods, beams. Waves and walks out of frame.
EXT. SIDESTREET - MARKET NEIGHBORHOOD ~ DAY

RAVEN has taken a bowler hat with a feather on it out of
her tote bag. Puts it on her head. Bops down the street
to the sound of her own internal music. A heavy housewife
in her fifties waves with her broom to the passing girl.
RAVEN'S obviously known in the neighborhood. At the end
of the street, a short, intense Italian man in his sixties
is finishing a bright, primitive mural that all but covers
the house. It's as if the house is in itse?£, an
illustration.
c,.

EXT. ILLUSTRATED KBOUSE - MARKET NEIGHBORHOOD = DAY
As RAVEN passes she shouts up to the artist.

RAVEN
So, Mr. Corelli...You got
permission from the city?

ARTIST
Don't care from city! City
cannot tell me how to paint!
I paint story of...

RAVEN 7 .
»..Of your family, I know.
Good luck, Mr. Corelli.

RAVEN laughs, passes on as the artist earnestly
returns to mural.

EXT. PASICH BAKERY - MARKET NEIGHBORHOOD = DAY

MRS, PASICH, an elderly woman, dressed in the old
country manner and wearing a baker's apron rushes
out of thetimeworn bakery. She's carrying an elabor-
ate pastry. We see RAVEN embracing her, taking thc.
pastry, biting into it. HOWARD PASICH, about 30,
short-cropped hair, moustache,

wearing a baker's apron and a tight T-shirt that
reads: "Fly Aeroflot", walks from the old oven room,
into the shop and out of his mother's bakery. He's
covered in flour.

HOWARD
Well?

RAVEN
(shrugs)
It's okay. I like the
chocolate thing better.

MRS. PASICH
(Central-European
accent)

See. I tell you.

HOWARD
(glares at
Raven)
Mama. You have the taste
of a peasant.

RAVEN laughs. HOWARD walks back into the bakery.
Stops. Turns.

RAMOS MARTINEZ, 25, dressed much like HOWARD.
(he lives at the top of the bakery with

him), Waves at RAVEN from an upstairs

window,

EXT, MAIN STREET ~- GARMENT FACTORY = DAY

RAVEN continues her route. She crosses the street
and heads toward one particular building -~ "Modern:
Modes Factory Annex."

INT, MODERN MODES FACTORY ANNEX = GARMENT DISTRCT = DAY

CAMERA TRACKS down row upon row of men and women,
all manner of race and ethnie persuasions, at their
machines in this vast sewing room. A radio is

tuned to a Portugeuse music program. Thread and
pieces of material are piled everywhere on the floor,
@s are paper patterns. CAMERA HOLDS on VERA in

her middle forties, Gecidedly overweight. She's .
eating a burger. VERA, FRANK'S mother, is staring
cut of the large floor-to-ceiling windows. Catches
Bight of RAVEN crossing the street. Grabs a parcel,
puts down her burger and rushes toward a door.

A Chinese floor supervisor in his thirties calls
after her.

SUPERVISOR
Vera,..How we doin’ on
Sample 7417?

VERA
I'm going to bring in
more fabric.

VERA hurries out the door.
‘

9 EXT, MODERN MODES FACTORY ANNEX = GARMENT DISTRICT —- DAY

VERA hands RAVEN the parcel. RAVEN is having trouble
fitting the parcel in her bag.

VERA
You've got your whole .
life in there, Raven.

RAVEN
I know. I'm a mess.

VERA
There isn't a guy in
town who wouldn't die
to take care of your

mess.
RAVEN -
(pause)
Was it hard to make
this time?
VERA

Sort of. I ended up
knocking off Italian

Vogue.
RAVEN

You coming tonight?
VERA
(nods)

Howard and I got to check
out some spaces

uptown, but I'll make it.
Hell, I always make it...

RAVEN
Thanks, Vera. You're the
best...I'21 wear it tilt
it doesn't quit.

VERA hurries back upstairs. RAVEN moves quicly
down the street. Vivacious. Imperturbable. Heads
never stop turning.

INT. OLITSKI'S GYM -- MARKET NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

RAVEN is slipping out of a pair of parachute pants

to reveal a brief and sexily thrown together dancer's
warm-up costume. Body builders, both male and female,
are pumping up as the CAMERA PANS. RAVEN waves

across the room to what are obviously close friends -=-
four dramatically attractive girls in their late

teens ~~ NADIA, LORRAINE, SOLITARY and TINA TECH.

The girls bodies glisten with sweat as they work out
on exercise machines. RAVEN poses in front of a
mirror in an elegantly pxagerated move that projects
both deep concentration and deep sexvality. She
keeps tensing her calf muscles and seems to be
examining them. She walks over to the Standing Calf
Raises Machine and puts on a heavy shoulder press.

She starts working the inside of her calf, then the
outside. MUSICAL SEQUENCE: MONTAGE of flexing

torsos and muscles as the entire gym appears to be
building to a vein-popping pump. TONY, the instructor-
owner wanders past RAVEN.

TONY
I wouldn't do a burn on
those calves...You'll
get too much definition...

RAVEN
They're only 12 inches.

TONY
But that's great...

RAVEN
They won't be right
until they're’ 12 and

a half.
TONY
(laughs)
You're something else
girl.

TONY passes and stops by a huge male builder dead
lifting. RAVEN leaves the machine and walks toward
her friends. She stops in front of TINA TECH, whose
short hair is oiled and slicked back as are her eye~
brows. Her warm-up costume is skin tight and made
of a sliver metalic material. TINA looks positively
pneumatic as she wrist curls two bell weights.

RAVEN
Tina, you'rr crazy. Look
at those bicep cuts...

TINA
And check the deltoids...
I want to look hard,

RAVEN
You've got to keep
your look female.

TINA
God Raven. What's female? I'm
into Hi-Tech. That's
me. Tina Tech...

RAVEN
Hi-Tack is more like it.
TINA
Look. See these wrist
curls. One at a time.

Fifteen pounds. I do

ninety percent angle work

with my arms and shoulders.
After seven times I wait for
the burn. Then when I'm

aching I do 21 sets of

seven moves...The last ones .
are really ball busting.

RAVEN
You're getting way too muscley,
Tina.

TINA
Don't you want to look
perfect?

RAVEN
Sure. But like
one of those illus-
trations in a magazine.
Kind of air-brushed. .
Not hard.

TINA . .

Ex-cuse me, Little Annie Fannie.
Look...I was born with big
lats...

(shows her

back)
I'm into muscles. What can
I say? I want to get
60 I look real industrial.

CONTINUED
 

RAVEN
It'll serew up your
dancing.

TINA
I doubt it...

The two friends stop talking and pose unselfcons=-
ciously in the wall-mirror, striking strange, physical
attitudes one after the other. LORRAINE, NADIA

and SOLITARY, noticing this, break off from

the machines and approach them. RAVEN arches
backward, undulates, trails her long, black hair

on the floor and lifts her head up between her legs
and out again in what appears to be the

world's most suggestive dance move.

SOLITARY
That's hot...

WADIA
Real nasty.

LORRAINE
Do you learn those steps? Or
do you make them up?

RAVEN

They're not steps. They're
hot poses that move.

(does two

moves)
See that...That's the Conga
Press...and that...that's
the Bugagku...Now those
are stepS...

LORRAINE
How do you know about stuff
. like that?
RAVEN

From library books. Anyway
it's better when you make it
UP.

TINA TECH
(jokingly)
Easy for you to say, bitch.

RAVEN walks over to a big portable radio-cassette
player sitting by the mirror. Pushes in tape;
MSIC.

The five dancers fal] into individual concentrations
and move to their images in the mirrors. MUSIC
BUILDS. They are extraordinary to leok at. Unique.
Before long the whole gym is rocking.,

EXT. STREET ~ MARKET NEIGHBORHOOD = DAY

Six bikers, late teens and early twenties, in leather
but no club insignia are recklessly driving the

market streets. They're behaving uproariously with
each other, obviously high. As they wheel onto MARKET
STREET, one points out a forties delivery truck
painted an unlikely color -- “PASICH'S BAKERY."

They gun their new YamahaS and race toward the

truck.

INT. DELIVERY TRUCK ~ MARKET STREET ~ DAY ’
HOWARD is driving. VERA next to him.
VERA
Where are we going to get
money like that? Maybe

HOWARD sees the bikers in his rear-view mirror.

HOWARD

to the truck, and make goading gestures. HOWARD is
livid.

Suddenly the bikers get into formation and criss=

HOWARD swerves. Bis truck hits the sidewalk,
narrowly missing a fruit stall, Frantically he gains
control of the truck. The bikers, laughing, pull

up in front of a nearby 24-hour coffee shop attached
to the Greyhound Bus Depot, a local hangout.

Shaking with rage, HOWARD drives the truck to the
HARD HAT BAR AND GRILL.

EXT. HARD HAT BAR AND GRILL ~ MARKET STREET ~- DAY

The Hard Hat is a three-stery building directly
across from the bus depot. HOWARD and VERA

get out, the bikers surround the truck, chatting
with each other aimlessly as if nothing happened.

VERA
{under her
breath)
Ignore these doorknobs
will you?

HOWARD has to squeeze past two bikers to get to
the bar. At one point he stops, squeezes back to
the truck and takes out a handmade, cedar makeup

case, (An-etmusphere-cf-extrememenacé. -<_

FIRST BIKER

HOWARD gives them a finger as he enters the bar with
VERA.

INT. DRESSING ROOM - HARD HAT BAR AND GRILL ~ NIGHT

CAMERA TRACKS across the dressing room slowly. A
long counter and mirror with makeup lights, Behind
five stools are five plexiglas platforms with gates.
We are introduced to five flashdancers in
final stages of preparation. First we see NADIA,
a@ gymnast dancer. She's wearing a high-fashion
black and white Harlequin costume with three costume
changes underneath. Wer look is almost operatic,
half her face in black greasepaint and half in

white pancake makeup, her lips a slash of scarlet.
She's applying eyeliner. Next to her is SOLITARY,

an Ultra Wave dancer. She wears a pink cape over

a black silk balloon-like outfit that is all one

piece. She's strapping on pink high heels with pink
ties that wrap around her calves. LORRAINE, is wearing
a shaped one-piece leopard outfit, lizard stilettos,
high-fashion jewelry knock-offs and multi-colored
makeup giving her a feline look. Next is TINA TECH
wearing a hard hat that has been cut down to look
like a skull cap. On the front of the hat is a
worker's hammer crossed with a lightening bolt.
She's wearing a see-through plastic overall. Inside
we can see other costumes in plastic and in various
primary colors. She's wrapped, snake-like, in
hi-tech electrical extension cords in various

pastel colors. On her feet are a pair of plexiglas
high heels with live goldfish swimmi.g in the heels.
TINA is feeding other goldfish in a small aquarium
in front of her. Finally we see RAVEN, unquestionably
the star here. She's not completely dressed yet.
PAMOS, who lives with HOWARD, is a hair-dresser

whose work is too extreme for the uptown salons.

He's blow-drying RAVEN'S hair. RAVEN reaches for a
bottle of Amaretto nearby and pours it over a piece

of cheesecake. Eats a forkful.

RAMOS
You know what they used
to say about Marilyn Monroe?

RAVEN
(preoccupied)
That she always wore her
bra to bed.

RAMOS
How did you know? It must
be true.

RAVEN
You told me...

Tina, don't you feel weird
about killing those goldfish
everynight?

TINA .
They're just goldfish...
Anyway, they're cheap.

SOLITARY

HOWARD opens his kit and ‘Shows TINA a pot of mixed
nailpolish.

TINA
That's not industrial grey!

ROWARD
It's gunboat grey. It'll

As HOWARD begins to coat RAVEN'S face with the creamy Rhoplea
substance, VERA rushes in carrying a black and silver

jump suit that looks like a space costume, RAMOS

sprinkles silver stars and glitter on the wild hair

Style then passes the blower over her face.

The substance hardens into a translucent, second,

over the leotards, al] this with mauve high
heels.

VERA
It's ready.

RAVEN steps into the costume. HOWARD. puts finishing
toucnes on her makeup. He takes a can of mineral
Spray and sprays her face until she glistens.

She looks sensational. Raven steps into the center
plexiglas cylindrical platform. Closes the gates

and presses a button. The plexiglas fills with agqua-
marine smoke, MUSIC is building. Presses the button
on a speaker behind the platform. RAMOS finishing
her hair. HOWARD making the makeup precise. VERA
fussing with the costume.

VOICE FROM SPEAKER
Ready Raven?
RAVEN closes her eyes, poses her head up. Legs spread.
Body filling with the building MUSIC. The other
dancers step inte their cylindrical platforms.

RAVEN

Okay. Now...

The sovnd of a motor humming. RAVEN begins her
Gescent through the dressing room floor.

INT. HARD HAT SHOWBAR ~ MARKET NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT

First impression describes the kind of bar you'd

expect in a working class neighborhood; Budweisers,
bourbon and the inevitable Steelers game on a color
televison set above the bar. Bus drivers, blue-

collar workers, some Oriental regulars from a nearby
Chinatown, a few men in suits. At the far end is

an unusual proscenium created for the "live enter-
tainment.” A sky with clouds is painted on the ceiling
above the stage. The audience itself is divided by

@ translucent, aquamarine glass room where tapes

are played and the lighting is organized. As the MUSIC
builds, RAVEN, her back to the audiunce, descends

from the ceiling in her cylindrical platform.

She stands rigid, legs spread and lifts her hands
high above her as if she were being tied up. Her
body is hit by lime green laser beams that give

the visual effect of being tied up. The four other
platforms and four other dancers descend dancing

to the music. Almost as quickly as they arrive

they ascend and finally disappear. The music shifts
in mood and momentum. RAVEN breaks her laser

bonds, steps out of her platform and moves into an
astonishing dance, precisely choreographed to the
music and the lyrics. The dance defies physical
endurance at one moment and is cool and graceful

the next. ' The audience shows a certain kind of

awe. CAMERA introduces PAUL POTOKER, & young 38, a man
attractive for both his looks and success. A dynamic
businessman and crusading citizen, he looks out of
place here, sitting with a friend, stealing time
before a squash game. He can't take his eyes off
RAVEN.

INT. HARD HAT SHOWBAR « MARKET NEIGHBORHOOD =- DAY

As the production number continues, RAVEN does a
stylish pealing of costumes and putting them back
on again. More flash than strip, the flashdancer
does not like burlesque. Her roots are in the
fashion photograph, magazine illustration, godess-
like notions of ideal womanliness.

RAVEN almost ignores
the audience, creating her own narcissistic theatre.
She is more interested in seeing herself move in
the mirrored wall behind the stage. She
mouthes the lyrics to the production piece as if
the song is directly about her life, her fantasies.
In the avdience we see FRANK holding JUNIOR JEAN'S
hand. He is staring at RAVEN with no small amount
of wonder. Takes his hand away from JEAN, sips
a beer. JEAN looks closely at FRANK, at the apprecia-
tion and excitement revealed on his face. VERA,
HOWARD and RAMOS enter the bar from upstairs and
sit at a table. The six principle WAITRESSES, all
wearing VERA'S high-fashion imitations, stop serving
to watch RAVEN. Their dream is to one day make it
as a flashdancer. The waitresses, all in their
late teens, know the music so well that they're mouthing
the lyrics too,.trying to strike RAVEN'S ultimate
attitude, rocking on their feet, as if they were part
of the dance. The production number ends with a
triumphant ascent into the dressing room. The show-
bar is jumping with applause, cheers and beers being
Slammed on the table. PAUL POTOKER and FRIEND make
their way to the exit.

JEAN stands in the spotlight, her head down, striking

an almost religious pose. Performs the sign of the

presents an unlikely musical beginning: but stirring

in it's freshness. She moves forward; slowly, eloquently,

PAUL POTOKER can't take his eyes off RAVEN, who he
recognizes. JUNIOR JEAN does a number of unorthadox
moves that are quite stonning. She flies into e
double loop jump. She's very good. Still, most

eyes in the audience turn to RAVEN who has become

the star here. JEAN looks toward RAVEN, and uncon-
sciously begins to follow her momentum, competing with
her. It's too much for her. In the midst of a

Gobble lutz jump she crashes to the ice. Groans

from the audience. FRANK shakes his head.

dress she's wearing to shreds exposing a
Bilver-sequined tank top. The dress is made of a
particular kind of disposable material. RAVEN moves
into what appears to be balletic twirls and twists

and we finally see the move seen previously in Olitski's
Gym. Her hair trails across: the ground and her face
moves up between her legs, undulates, swoops into another
series of moves, The bar goes wild when RAVEN ascends

developers?

PAUL

I like to give them

more to building than
making money.

You don't look like

MUSIC shifts. LIGHTS up. The podiums descend featur=

The previously seen young WAITRESS is dancing on
RAVEN'S podium. The podiums ascend leaving

LORRAINE moving to rhythmic Brazilian MUSIC. She

has about her a jungle scent. RAVEN starts to bop in
her chair furiously sipping her drink. PAUL can't

INT. RAVEN'S LOFT = WAREHOUSE DISTRICT = DAY
RAVEN, in painter's overalls, is on her hands and

The loft, having just been cleaned, is pristine.
Great pride is behind the care in this home.

Let's have a couple of
colds...

RAVEN takes two beers out of the fridge. Drops her
overalls. Puts on a pair of high heels. She's only
wearing bikini pants. As she pours the beers,

FRANK is discarding all his clothing. He lays back
on the bed and watches the vision of RAVEN moving
toward him, She puts the beers on a sidetable.
Matter-of-factly she climbs on top of him. Stares down
into his eyes.

RAVEN
You steam me up, Frankie.

FRANK pulls her roughly toward him, They kiss.
Deeply sexual, deeply physical. A scene all about appetite.

INT. JUNIOR JEAN'S ROOM ~ VERA'S HOUSE = DAY

JUNIOR JEAN closes the door behind her. Her room is

a self-created version of a tropical paradise complete
with a plastic palm tree and escapist posters of
Caribbean Islands. On one wall is a big poster of
Peggy Fleming. She pushes a sound sleeping device.

We hear surf crashing against a beach. She throws

her bomber jacket and tool belt on the bed. A sen-
timental, almost forties, musical atmosphere is evoked.
JEAN undresses straightforwardly. Walks over to a
wall mirror and examines her body academically.

She pushes her breasts up thinking that they sag

a@ little, Examines her profile. Changes her hair-
style with her hands. She's actually quite beautiful.
In work clothes she appears short, tom-boyish. But
without clothes Ker body is revealed to be full and
attractive, Slowly she walks to the window ledge

and sits by the window like a Manet figure. She stares
thoughtfully out at the old neighborhood.

A surrealistic long shot shows lamp-lighted mining

PAUL
What is this?

PAUL gets out. &tares for awhile then honks his horn.
CLOSE on RAVEN, in line with the workers, plucking
worms and putting them in a basket, keeping up with

the best of them. She looks up and sees hie headlights.
WALks quickly toward the car. The sun is just about

possible to see a pair of black French silk

panties. Hostile glances from conservative matrons

are directed towards PAUL'S table. Disapproval

"The Frazetta female is
small of stature but
lush...She is a sorceress,
a child, a woman; she is

erotic, powerful, improbable,
lovely and very much alive."

We see VERA, reading from an art book introduction,

standing with JUNIOR JEAN. Closes the book.

VERA

I've stolen ideas before,’

this is ridiculous...

JUNIOR JEAN

is a piece of newspaper with various cans of spray
paint, bottles of nail polish. She's painting a
realistic girl's foot on the outside of one shoe.

INT, JUNIOR JEAN'S ROOM ~- MARKET NEIGHBORHOOD ~ NIGHT

SUNIOR JEAN is drilling a series of holes over the
eye-slit in the stolen war helmet. She screws on

a pink, plastic visor that covers the eye-slit.

A soldering iron is plugged in and on a nearby chair.
She's made an opening at the back of the helmet.
Inside are a series of electrical wires and gadgets.
She solders one last wire in place. Turns off the
soldering iron. Blows on the connection to

cool it. waves the helmet to cool it further. It's
finished. Turns the face of the helmet

toward her. Turns on a switch at the back. A light

INT. HARD HAT BAR AND GRILL - MARKET NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT

As the platforms ascend, TINA TECH is the dancer
performing alone this time. She is wearing her Hi-
Tech extension cord outfit previously seen in the
dressing room. The goldfish swimming in the heels

of her plexiglas high heels are slapping frantically
around as she moves electrically to the music. She's
holding a plexiglas dagger that keeps changing color
in the light. She places the dagger blade under the
extension cord as if she were trying to free herself
from the clutches of a snake. At one point the cords
appears to be cut in half. She grabs the cords and
twirls out ef the snake's clutches in one long
balletic move. CAMERA travels back revealing the
audience regulars and HOLDS on one table. At the
table PAUL, RAVEN, and HOWARD, sipping Jellybeans,
watch TINA'S performance. VERA, FRANK and JUNIOR JEAN
watch from the next fable. FRANK stares resentfully
at PAUL, from time to time. RAMOS, near the door
leading to the dressing room stairs, waves to get
RAVEN'S attention. He's standing with ANGELENE,

a very shapely blonde in her early twenties. RAVEN
walks over to them as TINA'S performance continues.

INT. HARD HAT BAR AND GRILL - NIGHT

The lights dim, signaling a new show, RAVEN and

PAUL drink their Jellybeans as the strains of gospel
music buld. The platforms descend. At the center,
holding a Bible, is ANGELENE. She's wearing a
multi-colored skirt, G-string, bra, cowboy jacket and
hat. The outfit is covered in micro-dot lights that
flash images of angels with halos and Christian symbols.
She's also wearing painted cowboy boots with a black
garter belt. As the podiums ascend, TINA, NADIA,
LORRAINE, and SOLITARY dance satirically to what they
consider dumb music. AS ANGELENE: strips, she bends
down to touch her cowboy boots revealing a G-string
the shape of a cross. With her rear pointing to the
audience, she flashes a view of the cruscifixition in
micro~dots.

VERA
Obscene! *

HOWARD
Praise the Lord!

RAVEN shakes her head in dismay. She and PAUL watch in
disbelief. After awhile they look at each other and
can't stop laughing.

RAVEN
Let's get out of here...

EXT. CITY AIRPORT - DOCKING AREA ~ NIGHT

CAMERA TRACKS past various small planes and hangars.
We see PAUL'S Porsche perked beside a LEAR JET.

The jet’s interior lights are on. Door open. Sound
of laughter.

INT. LEAR JET ~- CITY AIRPORT - NIGHT

RAVEN is at the controls of the jet. PAUL is in the
luxurious main cabin opening a bottle of expensive .
champagne. He fills two glasses and staggers, tipsily,
toward RAVEN, who is wearing the same outfit she wore
at Les Copains. RAVEN is pushing buttons and speaking
into a mike.

RAVEN notices an elaborate tape, sound system.

RAVEN

system...

(plays with the

knobs, turns it

on)
Not too shabby..I'm going
to try my new music.

RAVEN fishes in her pink tote bag. Puts on her new
show tape. MUSIC starts slowly, almost melodic. PAUL
sits in a swivel chair as RAVEN begins her impromptu
dance. As the MUSIC builds she moves with an implicit
grace, immediatly creating a theatrical atmosphere.
She throws off her bowler hat. Snaps off her forties

, jacket revealing her breasts. She's also wearing long,

black silk gloves with the fingers cut off. Fingernail
polish sparkles in the light. She's wearing no under-
wear beneath the mauve leotards. MUSIC shifts its
momentum to hard rock. RAVEN turns the volume up

full blast. The music is deafening. She dances

out the door of the jet. PAUL, broken from his
reverie, follows her.

EXT. LEAR JET - DOCKING AREA ~ CITY AIRPORT = NIGHT

RAVEN is now rocking topless and in extremely high
heels on the wing of the LEAR JET. From the tarmack,
PAUL stares at this creature abandoning herself to the
music.

EXT. NEARBY HANGAR - CITY AIRPORT + NIGHT

A black S®CURITY GUARD in his sixties turns his head
toward the sound of the music as do THREE JANITORS
who are cleaning up. One JANITOR recognizes where the
music iS coming from. Turns to SECURITY GUARD.

JANITOR
It's from dock area 21!

The SECURITY GUARD presses button 21 of a lighting
switchboard mounted on the hangar wall. The LEAR JET
is hit by a spotlight. The JANITORS and SECURITY
GUARD are amazed at the sight of a girl dancing wildly
on the wing of the plane. They move toward the plane
in a rush. A MAN driving a fork lift loading vehicle
also catches the sight, as does an AIRPLANE MECHANIC
carrying a large wrench in his hand, dressed in greasy
overalls. They all move toward the plane providing an
audience suspending disbelief. The group circles the
front of the piane. RAVEN ignores them and pushes her
extreme dance even further, moving up to the roof of
the jet. PAUL, the FORK LIFT OPERATOR, AIRPLANE
MECHANIC, SECURITY GUARD and THREE JANITORS gradually
get into the spirit of the music, moving their own
bodies to the beat. They love it. A 747 JUMBO JET is
starting to taxi down the nearby take off strip.
The huge jet passes RAVEN in the spotlight on the smaller
Plane. CAMERA PANS past the long line of portholes on
the 747 as it passes RAVEN. FACES pressed to the windows
of the 747 show a whole range of emotions as they stare
u down at the girl and her avdience. The 747
passes by, speeds toward takeoff. The MUSIC moves to
another mood and RAVEN dances down the wing to the
entrance steps and into the jet. PAUL, obsessed,
rushes after her and slams the door. Looks of dis-
appcintment on the faces of the new audience.

INT. LEAR JET ~ DOCKING AREA - CITY AIRPORT - NIGHT

RAVEN poses to the last beats of the music. Her body
is running with perspiration. Her last theatrical
gesture is to place her hand between her legs as her
head shoots upward. PAUL moves slowly toward her.
Places his hands on her fa¢e, Tenderly touches her
features. Moves his hands down her neck slowly,
falls to his knees, moves down, across her breasts,
even more slowly down toward her navel. He's
trembling. Begins to pull down the leotards slowly.
RAVEN opens her eyes. Looks down at PAUL. A moment
of indecision. Finally reaches down and holds his hand.

RAVEN ” .
Paul...don't...

PAUL pulls RAVEN to her knees. Kisses her roughly
on the mouth. She reponds. They roll together on
the floor. Frantic passion. Finally RAVEN wrestles
free. Both are breathing heavily, quickly. Both on
their knees a few feet away from each other.

RAVEN
I...can't...I'm scared...

PAUL

Goddamn it! I'm not
sixteen. I'm 3B-years
old!

PAUL stands. Angry despite himself. RAVEN hit by
emotion is still on her knees. For the first time
we see her losing control over him.

PAUL
Get up for Christ's sake!

Flambe Yamaha...You bastards!

HOWARD lights the cognac with a iighter and jumps back.

TINA TECH gasps. Three explosions. The bikes engulfed

in flames. The BIKERS, beside themselves with anger,

come pouring out of the Coffee Shop, HOWARD'S jeans

catch on fire. He runs. They chase him up an alley.
Everyone comes pouring out of the HARD BAT BAR AND GRILL

to see what's going on. ROWARD falls, ‘slapping at the fire on
his legs. TINA TECH catches yo to him and beats the flames
out with her hands. She turns and slugs a SIKER.

Two other attack her. HOWARD gets up.

EXT. ALLEY. NEAR HARD HAT RAR AND GRILL ~ NIGHT

The BIKERS have surrounded HOWARD and are brutally
beating him, kicking him, His face is running with
blood. HOWARD slugs back viciously.

FIRST BIKER t
Fucking queen! ,
TINA TECH spins one of the BIKERS around and levels
him with a terrific punch. Two other BIKERS pick
her up and hurl her against garbage cans. One of them
kicks her squarely in the face. FRANK, RAVEN and
some bar regulars rush into the alley. The BIKERS
take off. RAVEN bends beside HOWARD, who's bleeding,
broken.

FRANK

Tina)
Call an ambulance!

A fire engine stands beside the smoldering bikes.

Police cars everywhere. RAMOS, sobbing, sits in the
ambulance as HOWARD, on a stretcher, is placed in

the back. TINA TECH is put in another ambulance.

RAVEN sits in the back with her. FRANK is enbracing
JUNIOR JEAN. She's crying on his shoulder. An astonish-
ing debacle.

Finally, RAVEN bursts into tears of great sorrow.

PAUL walks back toward the sad figure of RAVEN.

Holds her; turns her around; embraces her tightly.
A paternal moment. RAVEN, sobbing, holds on for

dear life. We realize, perhaps for the first time,

how alone RAVEN is.

VERA, the earth mother, is busily adjusting the
sandwich boards being worn by TINA TECH, JUNIOR JEAN,
SOLITARY, NADIA and LORRAINE. The boards announce
with some panache, the opening of TWO TO TANGO.

The girls themselves look terrific. A little shy

to get out there on the streets with the uptown
shoppers.

VERA
Get out there you sluts...

RAVEN
Keep it hot..

LORRAINE |
Oinga-boinga.

TINA TECH
We shall overdose!

RAVEN and VERA watch the rag-tag group, quietly hit
the streets, gradually gather confidence and finally
bop to the sound of their own internal music. RAVEN
and VERA have to laugh.

RAVEN breaks the embrace. Moves away fram PAUL,
away from the cortege, strikes out alone across the
vast grass. MUSIC SEQUENCE BEGINS:

INT. RAVEN'S LOFT - WAREHOUSE DISTRICT ~- DAY

RAVEN alone in her loft. Rain on the windows, Dancing
alone, wearing little more than leg warmers. A
poignant dance of mourning, moving on, alone but no
longer isolated.

INT. PAUL POTOKER'S OFFICE - UPTOWN ~- DAY

CAMERA PANS from photograph of ELAINE the dancer,
across the desk, to PAUL POTOKER alone, at window,
looking out across the rainy landscape.

INT. TWO TO TANGO BOUTIQUE - UPTOWN = DAY

C/U VERA'S hand turns the sign on the window. The

Sign reads: OPEN. Rain has stopped. Overcast.

CAMERA PULLS back and we see VERA alone

in the shop ready for business. The clothes, cosmetics,
even Ruven's hand-painted pumps are out for sale.

The shop is original, full of warmth and invention.
MUSIC SEQUENCE ENDS,

INT. COMET - MARKET NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

The car passes the Catholic church and Synagogue.

It passes the renovated house which is almost completed.
A new BMW stands outside. Inside the car, RAVEN,

City officials are outside. Men on scaffolds are
painting over MR. CORRELLI'S “offensive” mural.

MR. CORRELLI, head bowed, sits on the stoop.

INT. HARD HAT BAR AND BRILL = MARKET NEIGHBORHOOD =
NIGHT

A festive atmosphere. A large banner across the room
reads: CONGRATULATIONS VERA!. As the MUSIC builds

Six podiums ascend from the dressing room. We see

RAVEN, flanked by TINA TECH, JUNIOR JEAN, SOLITARY,
LORRAINE, and NADIA. Lime green laser beams hit

all six dancers, giving the visual effect of being

tied, All dancers break the ties at the same time

and reck together, precisely choreographed moves

in unison. GLYNNIS, her friend STEPHANIE,[ the
CONSERVATORY DANCERS previously seen) and the ADMISSION
DIRECTOR are totally impressed, The PRINCIPLE WAITRESSES,
wearing their high-fashion knock-offs, flash and mouth
to the music--all of them standing on tables. VERA and
RAMOS clap in the audience as do. most of the regulars.
FRANK beats his hand on the table. Bus drivers, welders,
crane operators and sandblasters beat their hands to

the music. The momentum of the MUSIC shifts. The
flashdancers move into a chain of tangos that create a
circle, snapping one dancer out into a solo from time

to time. Sisterhood. Elation. Celebration.

EXT. HARD HAT BAR AND GRILL = NORTHEASTERN INDUSTRIAL
city - NIGHT

MUSIC BUILDS. CAMERA pulls back. We see the HARD
HAT BAR AND GRILL, the bus depot. CAMERA TRAVELS
through city market at night, past the warehouse area
dn decline, past the fading garment district and ulti-
mately PANS the shimmering cityscape. The MUSIC ends.
Another cycle in the dream.
