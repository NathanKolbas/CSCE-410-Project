EXT. THE SPARE ROOM BOWLING ALLEY - PUEBLO, COLORADO - DAY 1 *

BAD BLAKE, fifty-seven years old, stands in the parking lot *
in front of his 1978 Chevrolet Suburban. *

Above him a sign announces: WINTER LEAGUES NOW FORMING
COUNTRY RECORD STAR / BAD BLAKE / HERE / FRIDAY, AUGUST 12.

Bad reaches for a Pall Mall. The pack is nearly empty, loose
and slick with sweat. He lights one and looks to the sign.

BAD
Jack, you bastard. A fucking
bowling alley.

INT. THE SPARE ROOM BOWLING ALLEY - MOMENTS LATER 2 *

The bowling alley is full of light and smells of wax. The air-
conditioning hits hard and turns Bad's soaked shirt icy.

A single bowler works in the middle of thirty lanes. Bad
hears the ball drop, the steady roll, and then the impact.

MANAGER
(0.8.)
Bad Blake! I'm proud to meet you,
God. I used to listen to you when I
was just a kid.

Bad manages a wheeze and smile and pumps the manager's hand.
The MANAGER is overweight, early thirties, and all smiles.

MANAGER (CONT'D)
Have a good trip?

BAD
Long but good. Played Clovis, New
Mexico last night. Saw some pretty
country, but glad to be here.

MANAGER
Down there's the bandstand.

The manager points to a make-shift stage: in the shadow lurks
a drum kit and microphones.

MANAGER (CONT'D)
I'll catch up to you later. Sure
glad to have you, Bad. Makes my
day.
Bad moves over to the BAR.
INT. THE SPARE ROOM BOWLING ALLEY - BAR — CONTINUOUS 3 *

Behind the bar, enormous fish swim back and forth ina
lighted aquarium. Bad calls to the BARMAID.

BAD
Darlin, bring me a J.D. up, beer
back.

Bad smiles and points to the fish.

BAD (CONT'D)
Buy one for the boys in the
backroom there, too.

The BARMAID, young, sullen and early twenties, doesn't smile.

BARMAID
Three twenty-five.

BAD
(winks )
On my tab, darlin.

BARMAID
No tab.

BAD
I'm Bad Blake, little darlin'. I'm
the band.

She turns and walks away. The manager appears at Bad's side.

MANAGER
Mr. Blake, we have a real nice room
for you over in the Starlight Inn,
and of course, your meals are taken
care of, but I'm afraid we can't
let you run a bar tab. It's in the
contract. Mr. Greene of Greene and
Gold put that in himself.

Bad reaches out. For a second he is ready to grab the gristly
knob of the manager's Adam's apple and crush it. Instead, he
touches the man's shoulder and gently squeezes.

BAD
If you and Jack have an agreement,
we'll have to stick by it. Don't
worry yourself about it, old buddy.

BAD (CONT'D)
(to the barmaid)
How much?

BARMAID
Three twenty-five.

Bad looks hard at the shot. He's sweating. The cigarette
between his fingers is wavering. He digs four dollars from
his pocket. The barmaid leaves his change on the bar. He
keeps it.

MANAGER
Mr. Blake. Let me personally offer
you all the free bowling you want.
Bad nearly chokes.
INT. STARLIGHT INN - LATER 4

The room is standard fare: Queen bed, small TV, sparse light.
Telephone in hand, Bad, shirt stripped off, runs his hands
across his broad belly and groans.

On the TV, a man and woman embrace. Their lips move, but no
sound. Bad talks to his manager, JACK GREENE, late sixties.

INTERCUT:
INT. OFFICE - LOS ANGELES - DAY 5

Jack sits behind his desk, staring out at the smoggy haze of
Los Angeles.

JACK
Bad, I didn't want to tell you
until you came off this swing.
C.M.I. cut out "So Sweet, So Bad".

BAD
But that fucker was still selling.

JACK
It had slowed a lot, and the chains
don't want it anymore. Plus,
Tommy's got nine albums out there
right now.

Bad sits up and looks out into the parking lot.

BAD
What about Tommy's new album? I'll
be off the road in a couple of
weeks. We can get right to it.

JACK
Tommy wants to know if you've got
new material.

Bad looks to the TV. The colors are streaked and blotchy.

BAD
You know I don't have new material.
And there's nothing wrong with the
old stuff.

JACK
Tommy thinks he's leaning too hard
on the old stuff.

JACK (CONT'D)
He doesn't want people to think
he's riding the gravy train.

BAD
That son-of-a-bitch has a lifetime
pass on the gravy train.

JACK
Come on, Bad. Remember who's asking
who to do a record here.

Bad stands and moves to the window.

BAD
Jack, you jerk-off. You get out
here, in Clovis, goddamned, New
Mexico and play in a piano bar or a
bowling alley. Get up the next
fucking morning at five and drive
three hundred miles with
hemorrhoids so bad it feels like
you've got a nest of fire ants up
your ass, and then you tell me
about riding the goddamned gravy
train. You and Mr. Country Star
Tommy Sweet both try it sometime.

JACK
Bad, calm down. Tommy says he wants
new material. I'll keep talking,
but he holds the cards. You know
that, I know it, and Tommy Sweet
sure as hell knows it.

BAD
You tell Tommy for me that he
wouldn't know country music if it
came up and kicked him in his world-
famous ass.

Jack keeps talking, and Bad puts the phone against his belly
and looks back at the TV.

BAD
Jack, I'm broke. I'm fifty-seven
years old and I only have ten bucks
to my name.

JACK
I sent you money when you were
still in Texas. Plenty. So spend it
wisely, Bad.

BAD

Did I ever tell you your mother
used to bite when she gave head?

Jack hangs up. Bad falls heavily onto the mattress.
INT. LIQUOR STORE - LATER 6

Bad stares at a fifth of JACK DANIEL'S for what seems like an
eternity. As he stoops to a pint of HEAVEN HILL, his knees
erack and he exhales. All accompanied by a deep sigh.

MAN
(o.8.)
Mr. Blake?

Bad turns and faces a man about the same age as himself.

MAN (CONT'D)
Hell fire. It is you. It really is
Bad Blake right here in my store.

The man reaches out his hand.

MAN (CONT'D)
I'm Bill Wilson. I'm a big fan.

Bad smiles and looks to the cheap bourbon.

BILL
Here. Here, Mr. Blake. Here's the
Jack Daniel's.

Bill pulls a full liter of J.D. off the shelf.

BILL (CONT'D)
Being a big fan and all, I kind of
keep track of what the stars drink.
It's kind of a hobby, you know.
Willie Nelson and his Lone Star
beer, Tommy Sweet and his Southern
Comfort, and Bad Blake and his Jack
Daniel's. Of course, I never
thought I'd actually have a star
right here in my store.

Bad eyes the bottle in Bill's hand and wheezes with desire.

BILL (CONT'D)
My wife, Beverly, is one of your
biggest fans. She'll flat die when
she finds out you were here in the
store. We're going to your show
tonight. If you could sing 'I Don't
Know' for her, it would sure mean
the world to her.

BAD
You got it, old buddy.

Bad can't take his eyes off that bottle of JACK.

Blake a drink.
Bad looks to the heavens and smiles.
INT. STARLIGHT INN - LATER 7

The bottle of J.D. is a quarter finished. Someone pounds on
the door. Bad opens the door to find a young man, TONY, with
long hair and a wispy beard.

TONY
Hi, I'm Tony.

Bad blinks in incomprehension.

TONY (CONT'D)
Tony. Tony and the Renegades. Your
band.

BAD
of course.

TONY
Me and the boys are over at the
alley, setting up. We were
wondering what time to start
rehearsing.

BAD
Soon as you can and do it as often
as you can. That's the secret.

Bad tries to shut the door, but Tony stops him.

TONY
What I mean is, what time are you
coming to rehearsal?

Bad sighs and leads Tony by the arm out to his van.
EXT. STARLIGHT INN - SAME 8

BAD
I got lead sheets if you all can
read music, chord charts if you
can't. Cd's and a play list. You go
on. I'll be by later.

Bad turns for the bottle and the room. Tony follows.

TONY
Mr. Blake, it would mean a lot to
us if you would come on over early.
I mean, we need to get the leads
down and all that.

BAD
Leads? Son, are they paying you
more than they're paying me?

TONY
But, I thought you could show us
some things, teach us some of that
old stuff Bad's Boys used to do. Is
it true you taught Tommy Sweet how
to play guitar?

Bad ignores the remark about Tommy.

BAD
All right. You all go listen to the
cd's. Listen carefully and study
the lead sheets. Give me an hour to
get some dinner and I'll be on
over.

INT. SUNNY SIDE UP CAFE - AFTERNOON 9

Inside the drab roadhouse, Bad pokes at a chicken-fried
steak. Pale gravy oozes from it and blends with mashed-
potatoes and corn. A WAITRESS slides into the booth across
the table from him. She exhales a long stream of cigarette
smoke over his food.

WAITRESS
Everything, okay.?

BAD
(nods)
Fine. Just fine.

She winks at him. A small row of mascara sticks to her lower
lash. She wears a red nylon blouse and a plastic name tag
that says, "Howdy, I'm Jo Ann."

JO ANN
Mind if I smoke?

Bad waves his hand.

JO ANN (CONT'D)
You must like to eat early and
avoid the crowds. Being able to eat
in peace without a bunch of people
asking for autographs and
stuff...Mind if I ask a question?

She reaches over and taps his knuckle with a long red
fingernail.

JO ANN
I always wondered if you had a good
time singing those songs. Because,
God, I had me a couple of real good
times listening to them.

Her laugh is deep and a raspy from the cigarette smoke.

BAD
Anything you want to hear tonight?

She bites her tongue as she thinks. Her teeth are stained red
from the lipstick.

JO ANN
You do anything from that album you
do with Tommy Sweet?

BAD
A few. The standards.

JO ANN
Any of those. God, I just love that
album, Memories: So Sweet, So Bad.

BAD
So does Tommy, darlin’.

She laughs that raspy laugh.

JO ANN
You two don't get along anymore?

BAD
(shrugs)
What the wives didn't get off that
album, Tommy did.

She runs her finger up his forearm.

JO ANN
Why don't you tell me your real
name?

BAD

You want to know that, you got to
Marry me. Otherwise, it's just Bad.

INT. THE SPARE ROOM BOWLING ALLEY - LATE AFTERNOON 10

As Bad crosses to the stage carrying his guitar and tweed,
vintage FENDER amp, a rockabilly version of Bad's "I Don't
Know," as played by the Renegades, swells up and staggers
him. Tony and the Renegades stop as they see him approach,
though the drummer continues to pound for a few more beats.

Tony steps down from the stage.
TONY
Mr. Blake, these are the Renegades.
DRUMMER,
That's it? That's your equipment?
Bad unsnaps his case.
BAD
This is it. A '59 Gretsch with an
action that would put a twenty year-
old whore to shame.
Bad looks to their heavy, stacked Marshall amps.
BAD (CONT'D)
If you're playing loud enough to
drown out my amp, you're playing
too fucking loud.
At that, Tony turns to his band and strums a couple of
chords. Bad digs through his case.
BAD
(moving toward Tony)
You might want to bring it up a
half step.
TONY
I'm in tune. I got an electronic
tuning meter.
BAD
I got a fifty-seven year old ear
says you're off.
And so their rehearsal begins.
INT. THE SPARE ROOM BOWLING ALLEY - REHEARSAL - LATER 11

Guitar in hand and now wearing dark sunglasses, Bad crosses
to his amp and takes a seat. He begins a blues-tinted solo of
“Somebody Else" that causes Tony to throw a look to his band.

TONY
That ain't country.

Bad looks up from his guitar.

Country's just the white man's

Tony looks to the Renegades and then back to Bad.

TONY
Do some of that Tommy Sweet stuff
for us.

Bad looks to Tony and then begrudgingly obliges.

BAD
It's just some of that cajun patois
steel-bendin stuff...

The boys look at one another as Bad starts in on one of his
greatest hits, "I Don't Know". He runs through a break full
of hammers and pulls, the style he taught Tommy and that has
become Tommy's signature.

TONY (CONT'D)
I'm not sure. I think Tommy plays
it more like this.

Tony begins the song again, throwing in double and triple
pulls, trilling the high notes. The Renegades join in
bombastically.

TONY (CONT'D)
I think that's more the sort of
thing he does now. That's the way
we like to play it.

BAD
Keep working on that because
someday Tommy will be playing this
very bowling alley. You'll all
still be here and you can buy each
other drinks, get drunk and be a
couple of guitar-picking wonders.

Bad cases his Gretsch.

Two hours before the show. Bad watches a MEXICAN soap opera
on TV, still without sound. He takes a long pull at his
bottle of Jack Daniels. He's pretty lit.

EXT. THE SPARE ROOM BOWLING ALLEY - NIGHT 13

Bad struggles across the parking lot carrying his guitar in
one hand and his amp in the other. He's an aging man dressed
in his signature black boot-cut slacks, vest and white shirt.

At the back door, Tony and the Renegades are lounging,
cooling off between sets. They watch Bad lurch across the
parking lot. No one offers help.

Bad's wheezing hard. The air is sharp with marijuana as Bad
watches a joint go from hand to hand.

TONY
We were afraid you weren't going to
show.

The band members look at each other, smiling.

BAD
Son, I've played sick, drunk,
divorced and on the run. Bad Blake
has never pulled a no-show in his
whole damned life.

joint and takes one more drag.

BAD
You sure they ain't paying you more
than they're paying me?

INT. THE SPARE ROOM BOWLING ALLEY —- LATER 14 *

The bar and stage area are dark. Bad adjusts his guitar and
steps back off stage, nearly falling. He nods to Tony.

Tony steps on the light switch and illuminates the stage
area. The band moves into an up-tempo version of "Somebody
Else."

At the end of the first chorus, Tony moves to the microphone.

TONY
Ladies and gentlemen, the Spare
Room is proud to present country
recording star 'The Wrangler of
Love," Mr. Bad Blake.

Bad steps forward to where the light is supposed to be on,
but misjudges. Only his guitar is in the light. He takes a
step into the light and swings into his jazzy melody, simple,
but quick and light, full of triplets that sound harder to
play than they really are.

long spell. But I also want to

Bad begins a Waylon-esque version of "I Don't Know". The
applause start again. The band comes in behind Bad and forms
a pocket for him to fit in a a melody. BILL (from the liquor
store) and BEVERLY WILSON, in matching shirts, jeans, and
boots, beam.

After half a minute, Bad unplugs his guitar,stumbles, and

then lands on one knee on top of his amp. He looks up to see
a red amplifier light, pulsing in the dark. He then steadies
himself and crosses to a cracked alley door behind the stage.

Bad's outside in the back alley, on his knees, holding the
rim of a garbage can. He's cold and shivering. He wipes his
face with a handkerchief, then check's to see if he's kept
his outfit clean. It's soaked with sweat.

In the background, we hear Tony and his boys play their
hearts out.

INT. THE SPARE ROOM BOWLING ALLEY - MOMENTS LATER 18

Bad crosses to his amp and watches as Tony mightily overcooks
a solo. He picks up his guitar, and just as Tony finishes to
a round of warm applause, Bad starts in on the same solo. His
musicianship is smoother, more efficient, and much more
Masterly. Tony meekly steps back downstage as Bad finishes
the guitar lesson. The crowd roars their approval .

As the Renegades finish the jam, Bad unsteadily steps to the
microphone.

Bad is fresh from a shower. He's wrapped in a towel. His room-

There's a knock at the door. He opens it to find a woman who
appears to be in her early thirties, with dark hair. She's
wearing a fresh denim shirt and creased jeans. This is JEAN

BAD
Two things I don't want to talk

Okay.. What's your real name?

INT. EVANGELO'S BAR - SANTA FE - NIGHT 26

The house is sparse and quiet. Jean keeps edging up to the
tiny bandstand to flash a strobe light in his face. Uncle
Wesley on the piano really fills the room.

In the middle of "Fallin' and Flyin", Bad steps back, nods to
Wesley and lets him go. Wesley doesn't hesitate. The sound is
crisp and sure.

When they come back to the chorus, the song takes off,
soaring as if it were something Bad hadn't heard in years.

INT. EVANGELO'S BAR - SANTA FE - LATER 27
At the break, a blonde woman in a low-cut blue dress

approaches Bad. This is ANN. Jean talks to her uncle Wesley
near the bar.

ANN
You're wonderful. You haven't lost
anything.

BAD

Why, thank you.

ANN
You may be even better than you
were back then. I'm Ann.

BAD
Hi, Ann.

ANN
I've loved country music all of my
life. I even know the B sides of
your albums.

BAD
Better than me.

ANN
Here, I brought you a Jack Daniels.
Your favorite.

Bad reaches for the J.D. Ann shakes her head to toss her
blond hair back. Jean has moved to her table to write
something in a thin notebook.

ANN (CONT'D)

If you aren't doing anything after

dinner, or just a cup of coffee.

Bad gives Ann a kiss on the forehead. In return, she squeezes
his forearm so hard her nails dig into the flesh through his
shirt.
ANN
Could you play ‘What Love Can Do'
for me?
Other fans move in for autographs and handshakes.

The size of the audience doesn't suit an encore. However:

Healthy applause as Ann beams. Bad and the boys dig in.

She gives him a smile he can't quite read.

Bad doesn't respond.

BAD

I'd have to say "Fallin and

In today's artificial world of

Bad thinks about this.

Haggard's real country. Billie Joe

Is Tommy Sweet real country?

He gives her the "I said I didn't want to talk about him"

She gives him a look as he writes his address in her
notebook. He hands it back to her and leans toward her. She
leans away. It's a near miss that leaves her breathless. Jean
looks at Bad for a long beat.

JEAN
I'll be there.

She smiles and exits quickly.

Bad stares at the door then pulls out a BUSINESS CARD. ANN
from the bar. He looks to the clock: 3:45 a.m. and puts the
card back in his pocket.

Bad's crashed out. The phone rings. He rolls over and looks

adobe structures.

INT. EVANGELO'S BAR - SANTA FE - NIGHT 34

The Friday night house is nearly full. Bad and the same local
band, The Sureshots, stir in the back hallway just before
showtime. Uncle Wesley, the piano player, leans into Bad.

WESLEY BARNES
I want to thank you for helping
Jean out. She's a real nice girl. I
mean, she's not a girl anymore, but
she's real nice.

BAD
She is real nice. You're right to

She hasn't had an easy time of it.
Her divorce, the boy, and all. But
she's solid as a rock. I think the

Wesley gives him a big smile, like he has just got something
settled, something that was gnawing at him.

You're real fine. Better than a lot

That was Suzi, my fourth wife. The

that all she had was a broke-down

his other hand through the finger posts.

Bad's fifty miles out of Phoenix. He's looking over at a '69
Pontiac GTO that he's been following for four or five miles.

Two people in the front seat, a man and a woman, nuzzle.

Suddenly, her head disappears. Bad pushes down the
accelerator. He looks over, but can only see the man. Bad
signals and pulls into the right lane, where he can get a
better look.

He's now a car length ahead of the Pontiac and sings along on
the radio. The station plays Merle Haggard's "Hold On You". *

He has a better view now, but he can't tell if he's watching

sex or nausea. The DJ announces they've been listening to

"Merle Haggard's 'Hold on You' written by "the late Mr. Bad *
Blake, one of the great ones."

Ralphie leads Bad into a room that looks like a bus station
john, white tile floor and wall. Four men sit on folding
chairs, eating and drinking.

RALPHIE
"Bum Steer", your backup.

The band all stand to greet Bad.

BAD
This is the big-time, boys.

Bad looks over to a shelf with cold cuts, cheese, and bread,
cans of beer, bottles of wine, soft drinks, glasses and ice.
A case of JACK DANIEL'S sits with a note: "Save some for me.
Tommy." Bad smiles.

EXT. SUN PAVILLION - STAGE - SOUNDCHECK —- LATER 47

Bad and the Bum Steer begin the intro to "Fallin and Flyin."
Bad stops playing, waves off the band and steps to the
microphone.

Bear, I need kick, snare, and tone
down the guitars. They'll drown out
my lyrics.

INT. LUCKY'S STEAKHOUSE - LATER 48

Bad sits at a table in the back corner. A commotion causes
him to look up from his MENU. TOMMY SWEET, handsome, mid-
thirties, and looking every bit the country-star that he is,
poses for a picture with adoring fans.

Tommy kisses an older woman on the cheek and then approaches
Bad's table.

TOMMY
Heard you might be over here.

BAD
(smiles)
You son-of-a-bitch.

TOMMY
I always admired that in you, Bad.
How the hell are you?

BAD
Worse.

TOMMY
That's about right, I reckon.

Tommy, holding a fancy bottle of WATER, plops down in a chair
across from Bad. He rests his feet on another chair. His
BOOTS are made of thin strips of leather, sewn together so
they form a series of V's pointing down the toe.

Tommy's jeans are adorned with holes and ages to perfection
and he wears a vintage Johnny Cash T-shirt. On his right hand
he has a DIAMOND RING in the shape of TEXAS. Bad points to
Tommy's bottle of SMART WATER.

BAD
Give up on Southern Comfort?

INT. LUCKY'S STEAKHOUSE - LATER 49

Tommy and Bad hover over a couple of porterhouse steaks.
Patrons still stare at Tommy. A YOUNG GUY of about twenty-one
shyly crosses over to their table with a pen and paper.

YOUNG GUY
Hate to bother you, Tommy, but I
sure would like to have your
autograph. You're my favorite. I've
got all of your records.

The young guy barely throws a glance at Bad. Tommy puts down
his fork and knife, reaches for the pen and paper and looks
to Bad.

TOMMY
(nods to Bad)
His is the autograph you need. Bad
Blake. Taught me everything I know.

The young guy looks at Bad without a hint of recognition. Bad
looks at his plate. Tommy signs his signature and hands it
over to Bad. Bad waves him off.

YOUNG GUY
I'll be at your show tonight, and
May even try to make San Diego.

TOMMY
Appreciate your support.

The young guy strolls off, beaming.
TOMMY (CONT'D)

all goddamned day waiting on the

Bad nods and looks to Tommy's ring.

BAD
Is that why you wear the ring?

TOMMY
You ever try to buy a diamond ring
in the shape of Kansas?

Bad laughs congenially as they ease back into their
friendship.

EXT. LUCKY'S STEAKHOUSE - PHOENIX - LATE AFTERNOON 50

Tommy and Bad exit the restaurant and walk toward the parking

TOMMY
A grind. Fifty dates in two months.

BAD
I got a career, too. And a marriage

TOMMY

Bad and Tommy make their way to Tommy's shiny black ESCALADE.
It's parked next to Bad's road weary Suburban. Tommy's DRIVER
exits the Escalade and opens Tommy's door. Tommy discreetly
waves him off. The driver moves to the back of the vehicle.

Tommy smiles and points to Bad's Suburban.

TOMMY
Glad to see you still got old
Bessie.

BAD

Runs like a top.
A beat. Then:

TOMMY
You gave me my start, Bad. Don't

taught me most of what I know
that's worth knowing. But I have a
life to live, too.

Tommy sits on his truck's hood. Resting a boot on the bumper.

BAD
Yeah. Well, those are the ugliest
boots I ever saw in my life.

the Pavillion is nearly full. The noise of the crowd is like *
a low grinding. THE HOUSE LIGHTS GO DOWN. The crowd responds
favorably.

Bad looks up to a spotlight that's trained on the stage.

INT. SUBURBAN —- NEW MEXICO HIGHWAY —- LATE AFTERNOON 58

Bad cruises along the highway, just outside of Santa Fe. The
fading sun illuminates the aspens of the SANGRE de CRISTO
MOUNTAINS. He starts to nod off to sleep, then closes his
eyes for a SPLIT SECOND.

Bad hears the crunch of the TIRES on GRAVEL and then an easy
THUMP. He sees grass and brush and a WIRE FENCE coming at him
in slow motion.

Bad moves his foot to the brakes and turns the wheel. The
truck bounces across the scrub brush, through the WIRE FENCE.

Bad's truck pulls scrub brush as it head for a TREE. He turns
the wheel as hard as he can, but the IMPACT sends him across
the wheel and into the WINDSHIELD.

The kinds of stuff we're talking

failure, cancer, an extremely good
chance of a stroke-are more
debilitating than quickly and
cleanly fatal. They'll kill you,

Obviously, you don't want to hear
this, and I understand it, but when
I see a case like yours, I have to
say something. You're a fifty-seven
year old man who is rapidly
starting to wear out. You get no
exercise, you clearly eat anything
at all, and let's not kid ourselves

He can hear Jean move through the house. On the television
that sits at the foot of the bed, two women talk. One fights
back tears. Bad hops to the other side of the room, where his
guitar is propped against the chair, grabs it and scoots back
to the bed.

For a bit, Bad just plays. He moves from harmonic to melodic

as though his fingers have taken charge and all he needs to
do, must do, is listen to what they are doing.

BAD
So?

JEAN
And now I'll have to keep it for
the rest of my life and every time
I lay down I'll hear that beautiful
song. And you'll be out there
running around, not even
remembering a day that I can't
forget.

Her tears flow. Bad takes a drink and holds out his hand.

BAD
If I could walk, I'd come to you.

She comes and plops down on the bed. He holds her hand

helplessly then offers her a sip of whiskey. She takes it.

BAD (CONT'D)
In the hospital, I thought about
who to call, who I knew that really
gives a damn about me. Then I
thought, who do I really want to
see? I won't forget this day,
darlin', I promise.

He kisses her tears.

Bad sits on a porch swing talking on the phone to Jack
Greene. His leg propped up on a table.

No, Jack, I wasn't drinking. I just

Pretty soon.

JACK
I want to get you back out there.

BAD
Jack, if you found out your sister
was turning five-dollar tricks,
you'd over book her.

JACK
Remind me to put you in a couple of
comedy clubs...Just so you know, I
have a contract here, offering you
seventy-five thousand dollars
advance for an album to be recorded
at a future date. Plus another
twenty thousand for first refusal
rights to all songs written or co-
written by you over the next two
years.

BAD
Holy shit.

JACK
Ditto. This is now your best year
in the last seven. And thank Tommy
Sweet for it. So ease up on
him...Talk to you in Houston, and
don't marry your friend!

BAD
I ain't getting married.

Bad hangs up.
JEAN
You want me to call him and tell
him I'm not about to marry you.
BAD
You might have waited until I asked

Jean kisses him on his forehead.

BAD
No, I'll sleep on it.

JEAN
You need to be in a bed.
(off his protest)
It's all right. I want to do it.
Will you do something for me?

BAD
Name it.

She glances at the glass of whiskey on the table.

JEAN
Don't drink in front of him.

Bad stares into her for a moment then blinks.

BAD
No problem.

She kisses him and enters the house. He looks around, yawns,
and empties the glass.

EXT. FIELD — LATE DAY 67

Bad leans on his crutches and stares up at...a heater roaring
FIRE into a huge orange and purple striped BALOON that is
lifting off!

Jean and Buddy are on board. Buddy is nearly beside himself
with excitement. Jean is a lot less happy. Buddy waves
frantically at Bad.

Bad snorts and waves back just as frantically. Jean's heart
catches in her throat as they go higher and higher.

As they lift away, Bad leans back against the car, stares up
at the bottom of the basket, reaches into his jacket for a
flask, and has a much needed drink. His hands are shaking. He
looks down at Big Bird drawn on his cast and has another
drink.

EXT. FIELD - LATER 68

Bad watches as Jean and Buddy climb down the steps from the
balloon. Buddy runs to him, talking so fast Bad can't even
understand him. Jean is glowing clear through.

EXT. BISHOP'S LODGE RESTAURANT - EVENING 69

The elegant restaurant is emptying out. Bad and Jean sit by

an outdoor fireplace. Bad's Big Bird cast is up on a chair.

There are two empty wine bottles on the table and a third is
almost gone. Jean is still glowing and beautiful.

JEAN
I would've never gone up in that
thing on my own. Thank you. Buddy's
probably jabbering about it in his
sleep.

Bad pours the last of the wine.

BAD
This whole domestic thing is pretty
intense. Is it always like that?

JEAN
What do you mean? You've been
married a bunch.

BAD
Yeah but, I didn't wuh..
(darkens/looks outside)
I've got a twenty-eight-year-old
son, Jean. I haven't seen him since
he was four.

JEAN
(look/long beat)
Where is he?

BAD
I don't know. His mom, Marge, lives
in Marfa, Texas. I don't know what
he looks like, what he's doing. I
didn't teach him how to ride his
bike or drive a car.

JEAN
Why not?

BAD
Wasn't there... even when I was
there. Hell of a thing, be this old
and not know anything about your
own boy.

INT. JEAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT 70

Jean, still quite drunk from dinner, checks on Buddy, kisses
his hair, and comes out into the living room. The fold out
couch is open. She looks at it, looks at her bedroom door
which is half open. She crosses to the door, peeks in and
sees Bad sitting on the edge of the bed in his clothes,
drinking JD. She knocks lightly. He puts the glass down and
looks over.

JEAN
You need help getting undressed?
BAD
Hell, yeah.
JEAN
I don't believe you.
BAD
Be a lot more satisfying if you
did.
JEAN

Maybe we can get away by ourselves
this weekend.

BAD
What's today?

JEAN
Thursday.

BAD

I can't make it 'til the weekend.

She blows him a kiss and begins to back out. Bad grabs at her
hungrily. Bad brings Jean onto the bed and unbuttons her
blouse. They kiss passionately, drunkenly. Just as Bad tries
to lay Jean down she pulls away.

JEAN
No...no, not now.

She kisses his hair and slides back on the bed. She can't
escape his grasp.

INT. JEAN'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - MORNING 71
Bad wakes up, grabs his constitutional drink, swings his legs
out of the bed, and the cast clunks heavily on the floor.
That hurts.

Bad's crutches lean against the wall, across the room.
Slowly, he stands, weight on his right leg. Then he shifts to
his left, but it's too painful.

He gets down and crawls across the floor. When he reaches the
dresser, he gets the crutches to move to a WICKER HAMPER
where Jean's draped his pants.

He puts his weight on the hamper. Seems sturdy enough. He
sits gingerly on the hamper and pulls his jeans on his left
leg. As he tries the other leg, the top of the hamper GIVES
IN and Bad falls in, ass first.

BAD
Ah, hell!

Jean runs in, sees the empty bed, looks around and spots Bad
in the hamper.

JEAN
Oh, my God!

He's on the floor, his left leg up, sticking out of the
broken hamper, his right leg splayed out and resting on top
of an aralia palm in a ceramic pot. His pants are caught
around his knees.

JEAN (CONT'D)
Are you all right?

BAD
How the hell do I look?

JEAN
You really want to know?

BAD
I'm all right. Get me up.

JEAN
Give me a second..

BAD
Help me up, damn it!

Bad tries to get out of the smashed hamper as Jean has a
laughing fit. BUDDY walks in and goes over to Bad as Bad
tries to wiggle his jeans up to his hips. Buddy pulls the
palm plant off Bad's foot.

BUDDY
Want biscuits?

Jean walks out, laughing her heart out.
BAD
For such a sweet lady, your mother

has a very deviant sense of humor.

A FLASH from a camera lights up the room..

EXT. PLAYGROUND - DAY - LATER 74

Swings, teeter-totters, and slides abound. Bad pushes Buddy
in the swing. Buddy's all smiles. Bad's enjoying himself,
too. We get the sense he wished he'd done more of this in his
life.

He's surprised when he looks down and sees his hands shaking
badly. He starts to reach into his jacket for a drink then
stops and tries to tough it out.

INT. JEAN'S HOUSE - DAY 75

Jean comes in and anxiously calls. Nobody answers. It's
suddenly hard to breathe. As she starts to search the house..
Buddy and Bad clamber through the door. They are both
inexplicably dirty.

BAD
It was fun, nobody died, don't ask.

Buddy obviously had a great time. As he runs to Jean
grinning, Bad slips into the bedroom and heads straight for
the bottle. His hands are shaking so badly he can hardly get
the cap off.

EXT. HOTEL BALCONY - TAOS, NEW MEXICO — MORNING 76

A serene hotel in the woods with a magnificent view of Pueblo
Peak. Drink in hand, Bad sits on a lounge chair in a white
robe. He stares out at the golden-hued Aspens. Jean steps out
onto the balcony.

BAD
Join me, darlin.

Jean slips onto a lounge beside him. She glances at his half-
empty whiskey glass. Then, after a lengthy beat:

BAD

JEAN
I want this to work, Bad. I do. I
just don't know how it can if you
continue like this. Day and

BAD

JEAN

And I don't want Buddy around it.
That much I know.

BAD
I heard you the first time. I won't
drink around him... And trust me,
I've been doing this a long time.
It don't affect me like you might
think. We got too good a thing for
me to screw it up.

Jean starts to respond, but Bad puts his index finger up to
her lips.

BAD
It'll be okay.

Bad grabs her hand and squeezes. He then pulls it up to his
mouth and kisses it gingerly. All Jean can do is nod. Bad
looks out over the vast expanse and decides to change gears.

Bad's Suburban looks better than it did, though traces of
bondo still remain. Buddy sits forlornly on the bumper as
Jean puts Bad's guitar into the back. Bad musses Buddy's

Bad embraces Jean for a long beat. When they part, Jean puts
his old bag into the Suburban and pulls out a near empty
bottle of JACK DANIEL'S.

Nearing Houston, the landscape flattens. Downtown Houston is
directly in front of him, all vertical light. The city is
stunning.

EXT. BAD'S HOUSE - HOUSTON - DUSK 79

Bad exits his Suburban and approaches his one-story, brick
ranch house. The house has seen better days, but looks as
though it was a source of neighborhood pride at one time. Bad
unlocks the door.

INT. BAD'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 80

On the coffee table, there are stacks of mail. Advertising
fliers, a few letters, a couple of bills. One large BROWN
ENVELOPE with the return address: IRS.

EXT. BAD'S HOUSE - BACK PORCH - NIGHT 81

A few stars are faintly visible against the overcast and
reflected lights of the city.

Bad sits on the porch with an acoustic guitar. He begins
working his way up and down the fretboard until a note opens
a door. He touches a melody he instantly likes. It then comes
as easily to him as an old song recalled after years.

BAD
Your body aches
From playing your guitar and
sweatin' out the hate...
The days and nights all feel the
same...

Bad writes the chords on a yellow pad.
INT. WAYNE'S BAR -— HOUSTON - DAY 82

Bad hobbles into this dark roadhouse. As he makes his way to
the back of the bar, we see a stage off in the corner.

Bad makes his way past trash cans waiting to be emptied, and
boxes of empty beer bottles. WAYNE KRAMER, stocking glasses,
late sixties and all cowboy, greets Bad.

The highway that calls for your

This ain't no place for the weary

This ain't no place to fall behind

Bad plays the melody as though it were a second skin.

Bad heads for the PHONE. Underneath the phone lies a stack of
PHONE BOOKS. He pulls out a tattered copy of the MARFA,
TEXAS, phone book. A book he's referred to on many occasions.

Bad thumbs through to a page he has dog-eared. His finger
traces down the page and stops at a CIRCLED phone number. Bad
picks up the phone and dials. It rings several times, then:

Hey. Yeah, I'm fine. Why?

JEAN
You didn't sound fine the other

dying a slow death.

BAD
You heard that? Hell, I'm sorry.
Must have been something I ate.

It's clear that Jean doesn't buy this. Over the phone we hear
the fish popping and crackling in the skillet.

JEAN
I called to say that I've got four
days off at the end of the month.
And that we might come, but I'm not
sure it would be such a good idea.

BAD
Hell, it's a great idea. Why would
you say that?

Jean doesn't initially respond. Then:

JEAN
Are you sure you're okay, Bad? I'm
very worried about you.

BAD
Don't you waste a minute of your

Bad hobbles out the door of a TAXI CAB. He's carrying an
overnight bag on his shoulder. He looks around, unsure who
exactly he is looking for, but sure he'll recognize him.

A YOUNG MAN with brown hair and an open-collared shirt walks
down the sidewalk toward Bad.

STEVEN

Bad just stares at him.

It's Steven.

Tears well up in Bad's eyes as he looks at Steven and nods.

It's a roof over our head.

Just then, MARISSA, a tall, thin blonde in a T-shirt and

Mom was a clothing buyer.

Bad glances at a picture of Marge's wedding.

STEVEN (CONT'D)
She married Jeff, another buyer at
the store.

He tosses the picture aside and picks up a picture of Bad
playing guitar to Steven on a blue velvet sofa. The skinny
kid, grinning, with a beer in his hand, is TOMMY SWEET.

Bad smiles as he comes across pictures of Steven from infant
to man. School pictures, vacation pictures, boy scouts.
Steven in football gear.

Bad comes across a picture of MARY JO and himself just after
a show. Bad in a wide-lapeled western suit, Mary Jo ina
dress that billowed around her body. She ages subtly, holding
her looks through most of the other pictures.

Bad comes across one of Mary Jo in the hospital, near the
end, where she looks like an old woman. Bad stares at it.

BAD
I bought this clip on your

send it to you, but I didn't know
how... where ya'll were exactly.
I've been carrying it ever since.

Bad holds it out. Steven looks at it, then takes it and holds
it by its edges as if it were dangerous or delicate. It's
battered and scratched. He flips it back to Bad. It lands in

his lap.
STEVEN
You better keep it around your

But I bought it for you.

She stops and looks right into Bad's eyes.

JEAN
Everything's not okay. He's four
years old and scared half to death.

BAD
You know that I wouldn't do
anything to hurt him.

JEAN
Well, you did. You and every man
I've been with are nothing but self-
absorbed assholes... Every fucking
one of you.

BAD
Calm down, Jeannie.
JEAN
You calm down! And stop calling me

Jeannie.
Jean grabs Buddy's hand.

JEAN
Come on, baby.

Together they step off the porch. Bad follows.

Jean's reached the waiting taxi. The taxi DRIVER has popped
the trunk.

BAD
I can drive you to the airport. Let
me at least do that.

Jean motions with her hands as if pushing something gently,
but firmly down. As they get into the taxi, Buddy waves.

BUDDY
Bye.

Buddy starts crying again. Bad watches them pull away.

INT. BAD'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT 122
Bad walks in the bedroom carrying a near empty bottle of JD.
He's drunk and looks pathetic. He falls onto the bed, the
bottle crashing to the ground.

The WHIR of the ceiling fan is interrupted by his ringing

TELEPHONE. It rings several more times. Finally, his
ANSWERING MACHINE picks up.

Adios.

Tommy hangs up. Bad turns over on his stomach.
INT. BAD'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - MORNING 123

Bad hasn't moved. He wakes and reaches for the phone. He
dials and lays back down.

BAD
Wayne. I want to sober up.

INT. SUNSHINE DETOX CENTER - BEDROOM — HOUSTON - DAY 124

Bad sits on his bed staring out a Magnolia tree. It's as
quiet as a Mausoleum. Bad's luggage sits in a corner,
unopened. The room consists of a dresser, a closet, a twin
bed and two windows. Bad lies back on the bed and closes his
eyes.

EXT. SUNSHINE DETOX CENTER - LAWN —- LATER 125
Chairs, filled with ten or so people, are placed in a semi-

circle on a small lawn encased by tall pine trees. Bad stands
and introduces himself.

BAD

I'm Bad and I'm an alcoholic.
THE GROUP

Hi, Bad.
BAD

A couple of days ago, I lost a
little boy. I was drunk. I've been
drunk most of my life and I've lost
a hell of a lot.

EXT. SUNSHINE DETOX CENTER - GAZEBO —- LATER 126
Bad leans against a railing inside a Gazebo that overlooks a
small stream. He drinks a cup of coffee and smokes a
cigarette. A red-haired man named PAT crosses to the COFFEE
MAKER next to Bad and offers his hand.

PAT
You're a musician, aren't you?

PAT
We're all actors in life, Bad, but
sometimes we have to rethink our
roles. You've got to know yourself

Pat pours himself a cup of coffee, taps

Bad on the shoulder

and heads back over to the group. Bad stares off into space,

thinking about that last comment.

INT. SUNSHINE DETOX CENTER - BEDROOM —- MORNING 127

Bad sits in a chair reading a Louis L'Amour novel. After a
beat, he stares out the window at the Magnolia tree.

EXT. SUNSHINE DETOX CENTER - LAWN - AFTERNOON 128

Deep in thought, Bad walks along a path

that circles the

Bad plays the melody and lightly sings 'Crazy Heart'.

BAD
Your lovers warm kiss...

fingertips
You are the man...that ruined her
world.

His complexion and body language is much better, healthier.
The Houston skylights illuminate his back yard.

131 INT. KELLER'S STEAKHOUSE - NIGHT 131

Bad sits at a table by himself. Patrons walk by and glance
his way. Bad smiles when they do. A bottle of PERRIER sits
next to his dinner. A FAN approaches.

FAN
Hey, Mr. Blake. Sure am a big fan.
Mind if I take a picture of you?

BAD
Why not?

The FAN pulls out a DIGITAL CAMERA, leans in a little and
takes a shot. He glances at Bad's bottled water.

FAN
I know you're a J.D. man. It'd be
an honor if I could buy you a
drink.
Bad raises his hand and smiles.

BAD
Not tonight, amigo. But thanks.

FAN
How about just a shot?

Bad holds up the bottle of Perrier.
BAD

The FAN smiles and moves on.

INT. WAYNE'S BAR - HOUSTON - NIGHT 132

Bad sits on a bar stool in front of approximately 65 people.
A cup of Club Soda sits next to him as he plays acoustically
and by himself.

BAD
Well it rained last night
And the stars shone bright
And way off yonder
We heard the whippoorwill

At the first light of dawn
We heard the He was gone
Our hearts was empty

And our eyes was filled

Open the gates

Welcome Him in

There's a Brand New Angel
A Brand New Angel

With an old violin

He finishes up 'Brand New Angel' to a round of applause.

BAD
It's good to be back at home.
Thanks for coming out.

He nods, grabs his soda and heads off. More applause as Bad
makes his way over to the bar where WAYNE waits. Wayne's all
smiles.

INT. WAYNE'S BAR - BAR -— CONTINUOUS 133
Wayne sticks his hand out. Bad takes it.

BAD

WAYNE
Damn, son. As Hag said about Lefty,
"he sounded good singing out of his

Wayne slaps Bad on the back.

road.
They head off together. Bad swigging his Club Soda.
EXT. BAD'S HOUSE - FRONT LAWN - AFTERNOON 134

Bad rides a JOHN DEERE riding mower. The sun pounds his back.
Even though he's sitting, he works up quite a sweat.

INT. BAD'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER 135

Bad crosses to the cabinet and takes out a glass. He then
opens the freezer and pulls out several cubes of ice. Out of
habit, he opens the Pantry. Staring him in the face is an
unopened bottle of JACK DANIEL'S. He looks at it for a beat
and then reaches beside it for a Coke. He pours it over the
ice reaches for his medication. He downs them both.

After a beat, Bad re-opens the pantry, grabs the Jack
Daniel's and drop it in the trash can.

INT. BAD'S HOUSE - BEDROOM 136

Bad's sweeping up his room. It's as neat as we've seen it.
The dresser's are clutter-free and all of his clothes have
been stored away.

Bad sweeps under his bed with a SWIFFER when out comes a
blue, children's T-SHIRT. Bad holds it up. It has a large
SUPERMAN 'S' emblazoned on the front. Bad smiles and neatly
folds it.

INT. BAD'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER 137

Bad stands by the TELEPHONE debating whether to pick it up or
not. Finally, he decides against making the call.

the cold morning air.

He climbs the last step, stops, and shines his boots on the
backs of his legs. Gathering himself, he faces that which he
fears the most.

As he reaches for the DOORBELL, his hand shakes, almost
uncontrollably. He makes a fist and brings it halfway to his
chest and stares at it, willing it to stop. After a deep
breath, he again moves to the doorbell. His hand still
shakes, but less. He pushes the doorbell and steps back.

After a brief moment, Jean answers the door. She's in her
robe. Surprise can't describe the look on her face.

JEAN
What are you doing here?

BAD
Please, just listen. I'm sorry.
With all my heart. I'm sorry.
I'm sober. Detox, Antabuse...the
whole bit. It woke me up, Jean.

JEAN
I'm glad, Bad.

BAD
No, not Bad. I'm going back to
Otis, my given name. I'm changing
everything.

JEAN
Good.

She gives him nothing more.

BAD

How's Buddy?
JEAN

Sleeping, but he's fine.
BAD

Can you ever forgive me?
JEAN

Yeah. I can. Forgiving myself is

that I'll ever get over that.

BAD
I'm different now.

JEAN
I am, too.

BAD

Just let me show you. We'll start
over, Christ..

Bad starts up the step toward Jean. She puts her hand out.

JEAN
You're not listening. I am truly
happy for you. And I hope you make
a really good life for yourself.
But Buddy and I are not going to be

part of it.
BAD
But I love both of you so much.
JEAN
If that's true, you'll leave us
alone.
BAD

Don't say that, Jeannie..

At this, Jean steps back into her house and softly closes the
door.

BAD
Jeannie?... Jean?

Bad stands on the porch hoping against hope that she'll again
open the door. Realizing it's not to be, he turns to leave.

INT. SEEDY BAR - WEST TEXAS - NIGHT 139

A LADY (Donna) in her early forties sits next to Bad in this
dimly-lit bar. Her skin is loose around her eyes and jaw, but
her face is thin. Her makeup is pretty thick and a little
sloppy around the edges of her mouth. Her tongue works the
edges of her front teeth.

BAD

Bad signals toward the bar, holding up two fingers. The
BARTENDER brings two more and sets them on the table. Bad
hands him a twenty.
BAD
Just hold on to that. Start a tab.
DONNA picks up her glass and raises it to him.

DONNA
Bad Blake, no damned truck driver.

They both take long drinks of their whisky.
INT. CHEVY SUBURBAN — NEW MEXICO COUNTRYSIDE - LATER 140

Bad awakens to the steady pulse of the red light on the
dashboard. It flashes "OIL".

It's raining and the wipers are going. The Suburban is full
of the sharp smell of hot oil. As he tries to turn over the
engine, we hear the shrill whine of the bearings.

Donna wakes up.

it jams.
BAD
Nowhere. The engine's seized up.

Bad gets out of the Suburban. The road is dirt. Bad looks for
the highway; it's nowhere to be seen.

The road is softening to THICK MUD. Bad walks back to the
Suburban. Donna's asleep again. He grabs the bottle of WHISKY
and a FLASHLIGHT. The rain intensifies. It's a frog-
strangler.

Bad nudges Donna.
BAD (CONT'D)
I'm going to walk for help. If
someone comes along, I'm going that
way.
Donna doesn't budge. Bad starts out through the rain and mud.

EXT. NEW MEXICO COUNTRYSIDE - MOMENTS LATER 141

Bad can barely walk. He's drunk, his ankle is tender, and the
road is inches deep in MUD.

Twice he falls and pulls himself up, crawling and stumbling
to his feet. To either side are trees, and he can see nothing
but the few feet of road ahead of him. He struggles onward.

The third time he falls, he can't get his feet back under
him. He crawls to the side of the road. His hand slips
through the wet mud and the rest of his body follows down the
DITCHBANK.

He lands in COLD water and rights himself. He's lost the
FLASHLIGHT, but still has the bottle.

Bad lays his head back on the ditchbank and takes a long
pull, then lets the rain wash over his face.

A lone spotlight shines on TOMMY SWEET as he sits on stage,
strumming his guitar. His band has vacated their posts,
leaving Tommy alone to perform an encore, THE WEARY KIND, to
his adoring fans.

TOMMY
Your heart's on the loose
You rolled them sevens with nothin'
to lose...This ain't no place
for the weary kind...

As the audience roars their approval, we pull back to reveal:

BAD BLAKE, off-stage left, standing next to his manager, JACK
GREENE.

Bad wears neatly pressed slacks, shiny Lucchese cowboy boots,
and a crisp white shirt held together by a turquoise Bolo
tie. His damp hair is swept back from his forehead. The truth
is he has never looked better.

JACK
Helluva song.

As Tommy begins another verse, Jack pulls an ENVELOPE from
his breast pocket and hands it to Bad.

JACK
They're getting bigger by the day.

Bad opens the envelope and pulls out a Royalty Check.

BAD
I'll say.

Bad stuffs the envelope in his pants pocket and begins to
move down the backstage steps toward his van. Jack grabs Bad
by the arm.

JACK
Great show. You're doing it, man.

There's a little gas left in the

tank.

We follow Bad as he continues down the steps. Just as he
reaches the parking lot, a VOICE calls out to him.

As Jean puts down her hand, Bad notices an ENGAGEMENT RING on
