FADE IN:

EXT. THE BRONX - DAY - FANTASY

WE OPEN on a montage of varied ETHNIC COMMUNITIES from the
different boroughs of NEW YORK CITY. CARS, PEDESTRIANS and
CITY SOUNDS intersect and blend with the beat of the music.

EXT. CONCOURSE VILLAGE CO-OP - DAY - FANTASY

A door opens and a pair of BEAT UP CONVERSE KICKS step
outside. They belong to NATASHA KINGSLEY, 17, beautiful, with
an enormous afro. The sun on her face makes her smile.

NATASHA (V.O.)
I don’t care what anyone says...
New York’s the best city in the
world.

While on her phone, Natasha struts by local shops: a
Pakistani restaurant with a line of CAB DRIVERS out the door,
an Optimo cigar store, and a Taiwanese electronics store.

NATASHA (V.O.)
It's a place where 8.5 million
people coexist--

EXT. SUBWAY STATION - DAY - FANTASY
Passengers rush down the stairs as she climbs up to the “D”
train station at 167th. Thick Jamaican accents blend with

Spanish and Haitian French. Natasha listens, smiles.

NATASHA (V.O.)
It’s a lot to take in.

A train whizzes by revealing her on the platform.

EXT. FORT WASHINGTON - DAY - FANTASY

Natasha emerges from the “A” train at 175th. BEVERLY “BEV”
RAMIREZ, 17, Dominican, waits anxiously. They’re late. The
girls rush off arm-in-arm.

NATASHA (V.O.)
But with a little luck you can find
a best friend.
EXT. THE UNITED PALACE THEATER - DAY - FANTASY

A number of SENIORS stand in line. “Congratulations Class of
2019 - The Bronx High School of Science” is on the marquee.
Natasha and Bev squeeze in as the line moves forward.

NATASHA (V.O.)
It's a city where hard work and
determination are constants against
unknown variables in the equation
for success--

INT. THE UNITED PALACE THEATER - EVENING - FANTASY

Inside the ornate auditorium, velvet seats are filled with
FAMILY and FRIENDS. The STUDENTS, now dressed in graduation
caps and gowns, enter single file to Pomp and Circumstance.

INT. STAGE - EVENING - FANTASY

PRINCIPAL and FACULTY on stage. Natasha’s poised at the edge.
Like a runner in blocks. Her name is barely called when she
Marches across the stage to claim her diploma.

NATASHA (V.O.)
...And dreams can become tangible
when you reach out and grab them.

EXT. STATEN ISLAND BACKYARD - NIGHT - FANTASY

A Caribbean-American Graduation Party in full swing. Lights
strung from corner posts. A Jamaican flag stretched across
the fence. Jerk chicken and fish on the grill. Dishes with
curried goat, oxtails, plantains, peas and rice. ADULTS in
traditional garb. And TEENS on a makeshift dance floor. Find
Natasha and Bev in the middle. Dancing. Laughing.

NATASHA (V.O.)
I wouldn’t have wanted this perfect
night to happen anywhere but here:
the city I’m proud to call my home.

On Tasha’s face, smiling as she looks at the night sky filled
with fireworks and stars. Twinkling. It’s truly magical.

MATCH CUT TO:
INT. NATASHA’S APARTMENT - DAY - REALITY

A NASA STAR MAP on a wall. Pull out to reveal Tasha in a
small apartment, moving boxes everywhere.

NATASHA (V.O.)
Or at least a city I used to call
my home.

 

Behind her, a LITTLE HAND pulls back the bright blue curtain
separating the room. REVEAL: PETER, 9 years old, chocolate
with dreadlocks and a grin from ear to ear.

NATASHA (V.O.)
Unless a cataclysmic blunder is
corrected, the odds of me actually
graduating with my friends are
declining. Rapidly.

Peter whips the curtain closed, unseen.

NATASHA (V.O.)
You see, I’m an illegal immigrant
and my family is scheduled for
deportation. Tomorrow.

WHOOSH - Natasha pulls back the curtain. Peter is juggling a
soccer ball on his knees in the next room. ZOOM in on Peter.

PETER
Look, Tasha!

Peter fumbles with the ball. The ball gets away from him,
bumping into a neat stack of Natasha’s books.

NATASHA
How many times do I have to tell
you not to practice in our room?!

Peter picks his nose and examines what he dug up.

NATASHA (CONT’D)
Ewww! Peter, stop it. You’1l never
get friends that way.

PETER
Doesn't matter. I’1l make new
friends in Jamaica!

Natasha sighs heavily, the weight of her family’s struggles
on her shoulders. A key RATTLES in the lock.

MRS. KINGSLEY, Natasha’s 40-ish, world-weary mother, drags in
from work wearing a waitress uniform.
4.

She sees a kitchen full of dirty dishes. NOTE: Mr. And Mrs.
Kingsley both speak with a heavy Jamaican accent and dialect.

MRS. KINGSLEY
Tasha. How many times I’m gonna
have to tell you to clean the
dishes before I come home?

NATASHA
You haven’t even closed the door
yet and you're already yelling--

MRS. KINGSLEY
It's not enough to pick up dirty
plates at work? I come home to pick
up dirty plates too?!

NATASHA
Mom, please. I’11 do it now.

Mrs. Kingsley heads to her bedroom. Natasha goes into the
kitchen, draws soapy water and washes the dishes. Mrs.
Kingsley emerges from the bedroom wearing a bathrobe.

NATASHA (CONT’D)
You work too much.

MRS. KINGSLEY
Somebody gotta keep a roof over all
our heads, child. Who else gonna do
it?

REVEAL: MR. KINGSLEY, late 40s, small frame, sad eyes,
sitting in front of the TV. We haven’t noticed him until now.

Mr. Kingsley watches as LAWRENCE OLIVIER performs a monologue
from “Othello” on screen. He studies him intently.

NATASHA (V.O.)
My father’s an actor. At least,
that’s why he came to America. But
that’s not exactly how it’s worked
out.

PULL OUT: Mr. Kingsley performs the scene along with Olivier.
He’s in perfect sync with the actor on TV.

NATASHA (V.O.)
It’s his fault we’re in this mess.

Natasha finishes the dishes. Mrs. Kingsley makes eggs.

MRS. KINGSLEY
You want breakfast?
NATASHA
I have an appointment at the
Immigration Office this morning.
It's at eight.

MRS. KINGSLEY
You don’t think it’s time for you
to give up now, Tasha? You don’t
think what you’re doing is futile?

Natasha grabs a piece of fruit off the table.

NATASHA
There’s still time, Mommy. We have
today. And I’m going to use every
last second. Can’t give up yet.

PETER
Don’t think of it as giving up.
Think of it as embracing destiny.

NATASHA
I’d rather make my own.

Peter smiles, turns up Sister Nancy’s “Bam Bam” and sings
along. Natasha rolls her eyes. She grabs her headphones and
her Physics textbook.

PETER
(re: textbook)
We leaving, Tasha. You don’t have
to turn in homework. We’re free!

NATASHA
I’ll be back later.

MRS. KINGSLEY
You have a lot to finish here. I
still see open boxes in your room.

NATASHA
Mom, I really gotta go.

Natasha heads for the door, determined. She takes a deep
breath, opens the door and steps outside.
EXT. ELEVATED TRAIN PLATFORM - DAY

Natasha stops at a specific spot on the platform and checks
her phone: 6:55 AM. She looks down the track-- nothing.

NATASHA
Ugh. Come on. Not today.
INT. DANIEL’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAY

DANIEL JAE HO BAE, 17, stands in front of a mirror sizing
himself up in the suit he’s wearing. He adjusts his red tie,
clearly uncomfortable in what he’s wearing.

DANIEL (V.O.)
Today's the day my whole life has
led up to...

From outside the room, his mother, MIN SOO, 40s, calls out:

MIN SOO (0.S.)
(in Korean)

Daniel! I’m making you a special

breakfast. Hurry down.

DANIEL (V.O.)
The day of my college interview for
Yale.

DANIEL
Coming!

DANIEL (V.O.)
The day that decides my future.

Behind him, shelves full of the world’s greatest poets:
Shakespeare, Shelly, Frost, Poe, Plath, Angelou, Hughes.

DANIEL (V.O.)
Normally I’d write a two-page poem
about something of this magnitude.
At least a haiku. But today, my
anxiety’s holding me hostage.

Daniel grabs his writer’s notebook, throws it into his
satchel. Takes one final glance at himself.

DANIEL (V.O.)
Because I need every brain cell
focused on nailing this interview.

Daniel takes one final glance at himself, then exits.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Daniel’s mother steams frozen dumplings. Daniel pours a bowl
of Cap’n Crunch. She shakes her head disapprovingly. Min Soo
speaks with a heavy Korean accent.
MIN SOO
Too much sugar. You need a sharp
mind today.

She grabs the bowl of cereal, replaces it with a plate of
dumplings, and pours the dry cereal back into the box.

DANIEL (V.O.)
I’m pretty sure I inherited my
mother’s anxiety...

INT. JFK AIRPORT - CUSTOMS - FLASHBACK

YOUNG MIN SOO and YOUNG DAE HYN, nervous and afraid, present
their paperwork to the CUSTOMS AGENT.

DANIEL (V.O.)
Which started the day she uprooted
her whole life in Korea to come to
America. For most immigrants,
moving to a foreign country is an
act of faith. What if you can’t
adapt? What if you’re not welcomed?
What if you lose all sense of your
identity and culture?

INT. HOME - FLASHBACK - TWO YEARS LATER

FAMILY and FRIENDS crowd the apartment. Min Soo holds her
first born, CHARLIE, as ONE-YEAR-OLD DANIEL crawls toward
various objects: a stethoscope, pen, basketball, etc. Each
object represents a career or “fate.” THIS IS A KOREAN
DOLJANCHI or “DOL” where the child “chooses their destiny.”

DANIEL (V.O.)
So when my brother and I were born,
she gave us both an American name
and a Korean name. So we would know
where we were from. And where we
were going.

The family cheers as Young Daniel nears the stethoscope, then

grabs the PEN instead to his parents’ dismay.

INT. KITCHEN - PRESENT

Min Soo interrogates her son between his bites of breakfast.
MIN SOO

How’s your grade in math? You don’t
like math.
DANIEL
B plus. But the rest are A’s.

MIN SOO
Why no A in math yet, Daniel? Aigo!
It's time you get serious...
(then, in Korean)
Don’t be like your brother.

Right as she says this, Daniel’s brother, CHARLIE, 19, walks
into the kitchen. Pretends he doesn’t hear this, but his
resentful demeanor gives him away.

MIN SOO (CONT'D)
I made mandu.

CHARLIE
Awww. Daniel’s “special breakfast.”
I‘ll pass.

Charlie strokes Daniel’s hair. Daniel slaps his hand away.

DANIEL (V.O.)
My brother, Charlie, is an asshole.

Charlie grabs the box of Cap’n Crunch, then pours cereal and
milk into a bowl and sits. He chomps loudly with each bite.

DANIEL (V.O.)
He’s been at home the past semester
because he failed too many classes
at BU. An epic screw up that my
parents can’t accept.

MIN SOO
Close your mouth when you eat.

Charlie ignores her then SLURPS the remaining milk from the
bowl. He stands, looks down at Daniel.

CHARLIE
Good luck with your day, little
brother.

Charlie tries to touch Daniel’s hair again and is batted
away.

CHARLIE (CONT’D)
Wouldn’t want to disappoint Mommy
and Daddy if you don’t get into an
Ivy.

Charlie exits, leaving his dirty bowl on the table.
DANIEL (V.O.)
I should hate Charlie, but these
days, I mostly feel sorry for him.

MIN SOO
I just don’t understand what
happened to your brother. Why he
can’t behave, like you.

DANIEL
Umma, give him a break.

Daniel finishes the last of the dumplings. Grabs his plate
and hand washes it in the sink.

Min Soo looks over her son, eyes honing in on his bun.
MIN SOO
You cut your hair before the
interview.

Daniel groans, but Min Soo is not having it.

MIN SOO (CONT'D)
Too long. You look like a girl.

DANIEL
They let girls into Yale, too.

Min Soo scolds him with her eyes, then hands him a money
pouch with deposit slips.

MIN SOO
Appa forgot this. You bring it to
him. After you get a hair cut.

Daniel takes the pouch. Kisses his Mom on the cheek.
DANIEL
Alright, Umma. I’1l get it cut.
(off her skeptical look)
I promise.

Daniel grabs his bag and heads for the door.

EXT. NORTHERN BLVD. - DAY

Daniel makes his way through his busy Queens neighborhood,
passing a slew of restaurants, bars and vendors, etc., all
written in Korean.
10.

INT. USCIS - WAITING ROOM - LATER

Natasha frantically charges through the MULTI-CULTURAL
RAINBOW of IMMIGRANTS. Heads over to the RECEPTIONIST.
Sweating and short of breath.

NATASHA
Natasha Kingsley for Karen Whitney.

The Receptionist checks her appointment sheet, and shakes her
head.

RECEPTIONIST
You’re too late. You’1l have to
call the main USCIS line and make a
new appointment.

NATASHA
No, you don’t understand. I can’t
reschedule!

RECEPTIONIST

I’m sorry. You’ll have to call the
main line.

The Receptionist shrugs and looks down, dismissing Natasha.
Natasha starts to panic.

NATASHA
I don’t have time for that. This is
an emergency. The trains were
delayed.
(getting emotional)
Just-- could you please call Ms.
Whitney? She told me to come back.

RECEPTIONIST
Your appointment was for 8 AM. It
is now 8:15. She’s seeing another--

NATASHA
Please. Just call her. Now!

Natasha’s now hysterical voice rings through the reception
area. The other applicants stare in her direction.

NATASHA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
I guess ‘desperation’ translates
into every language.

The Receptionist nods at a SECURITY GUARD standing by the
door. He sets his jaw and turns toward Natasha.
11.

But before he can reach her, another door opens. A tall,
thin, brown-skinned man beckons Natasha: LESTER BARNES, 40s.

LESTER
(to the Receptionist)
It's alright, Mary. I’1ll take her.

INT. USCIS - LESTER BARNES’S OFFICE - MINUTES LATER

Natasha sits in front of an immaculately kept desk. Turns as
Lester enters with a RED FILE in his hand.

LESTER
My name is Lester Barnes.

NATASHA
Hi, I’'m--

He holds up a hand to silence her.

LESTER
Everything I need to know is in
this file. Do yourself a favor and
stay quiet while I read it.

Natasha falls silent. Reaches across his desk and pockets one
of his business cards. After a beat, Lester finally looks up.

LESTER (CONT’D)
Why are you here?

NATASHA
Karen--Ms. Whitney--told me to come
back. She said maybe there was
something--

LESTER
Yeah, well Karen’s new. Your
family’s last appeal was rejected.
The deportation stands as is. You
and your family will have to leave
tomorrow.

He closes the file and pushes a box of tissues toward her in
anticipation of her tears. Natasha shakes it off.

NATASHA (V.O.)

I didn't cry when my father told us
about the deportation orders. I’m
not going to start crying now.

Natasha gathers her things. Heads for the door. But she stops
with her hand on the knob, swallows her pride. Turns around.
12.

NATASHA
So there’s really nothing you can
do to help me?

He taps the closed file with his fingers.

LESTER
Your dad’s DUI--

NATASHA
Is his problem. Why do I have to
pay for his mistake?

LESTER
You’re still here illegally.

Natasha nods, on the verge of tears. She heads for the door.

LESTER (CONT’D)
I’ve been to your country. I’ve
been to Jamaica.

He smiles at the memory as Natasha turns back to him.
LESTER (CONT’D)

I had a nice time. Everything is
irie there, man. You'll be alright.

Natasha glares at Lester.

NATASHA
Where did you go?

LESTER
Negril. Very nice place.

NATASHA
Did you leave the hotel grounds?

LESTER
I wanted to but my--

NATASHA
But your wife didn’t want to
because was she scared, right?

LESTER
No, it’s just--
13.

NATASHA
You listened to Bob Marley, and a
bartender got you some pot and
someone told you what irie means,
and now you think you know
something. That is not a country.
That is a resort.

He holds up his hands, defending himself.

NATASHA (CONT’D)
Don’t tell me I'll be alright. I
don’t know that place. I’ve been
here since I was eight years old.
Now it’s my senior year. I should
be worrying about the same things
my friends are-- like prom and
graduation. But instead I’m
worrying about being shipped to a
country that’s totally foreign to
me. This is my home!

Natasha’s tears finally pour out. Mr. Barnes slides the
tissue box closer. She takes a handful, then heads to the
door--

LESTER
Wait.

EXT. NORTHERN BLVD. - DAY

Daniel leans against a street light, checking his phone.
JUMPS as someone WHISTLES loudly in his ear. He turns--

DANIEL
What the--?

Reveal OMAR HASSABALA, 19, Middle Eastern, raised on Hip Hop.

OMAR
I thought you were going to wait
until right before the meeting to
put the stick up your ass.

DANIEL
Don’t be mad because I’m going to
be part of the one percent.

Omar checks out Daniel’s suit, laughing.
OMAR

You look like a Lebanese insurance
salesman.
14.

DANIEL
You’re supposed to be making me
feel better about going to Yale.

OMAR
That's what I’m doing. Easing your
impending sense of doom with the
use of comedy. It’s a known tactic.

DANIEL
Well, try something else.

OMAR
You could just be like me and not
go. How about that?

DANIEL
Unlike you, I actually care about
what my parents think. And anyway,
the interview’s today. Too late to
back out now.

Omar shrugs and leads the way down the subway stairs.

OMAR
You’re supposed to wear black to a
funeral by the way. Not gray.

Daniel playfully hits Omar and they descend into the subway.

EXT. USCIS - DAY

Tasha stares at a business card and dials the number on it. A
WOMAN answers the line.

WOMAN (V.0O.)
Mr. Fitzgerald's office.

NATASHA
Hi, I'd like to make an appointment
with Mr. Fitzgerald as soon as
possible, please.

WOMAN (V.O.)
Who am I speaking with?

NATASHA
Natasha Kingsley.

WOMAN (V.0O.)
Hi, Natasha. What issue can I help
you with?
15.

Tasha hesitates, afraid to say the words aloud. Silence.

WOMAN (V.O., CONT’D)
Hello, ma’am? He does have a slot
at 11 A.M. Can you tell me your
issue?

NATASHA
I’m an illegal alien.

Tasha’s heart races, afraid. We see the giant imposing
federal buildings surrounding her as she sits on the steps.

INT. SUBWAY - DAY

Daniel and Omar sit in the congested subway car. Daniel looks
at his reflection in the shiny metal subway door. Turns so he
can see his ponytail.

OMAR
You should just let me cut your
hair. I brought my pocket knife.

DANIEL
No, thanks.

OMAR
Your mom’s right, you gotta lose
the man bun. You don’t want to be a
virgin forever.

DANIEL
You know, if this interviewer’s so
smart, he’ll recognize a cool
haircut when he sees one.

OMAR
Or at least a desperate attempt at
cool.

The train COMES TO A SCREECHING HALT. The friends, along with
the other PASSENGERS, wait patiently for a beat. THEN, a
super CHIPPER VOICE over the loudspeaker...

CONDUCTOR (V.O.)
Looks like we got a slight delay,
folks. Track work on 68th.

A collective GROAN from the passengers.

CONDUCTOR (V.O.)
I know you’re all panicking,

thinking that you’re late...
(MORE )
16.

CONDUCTOR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
but look on the bright side, maybe
the universe is telling you
something.

GROANS again.

OMAR
I knew we should’ve taken the
express.

CONDUCTOR (V.O.)
Happens to me all the time.
Something goes off in my routine --
boom...must be the Universe. It’s
full of unexpected blessings.

PASSENGER #1
Usually the nut jobs are on the
train, not driving it.

CONDUCTOR (V.O.)
Deli screws up my order.
Universe... Maybe I shouldn’t be
eatin’ deli sandwiches all the
time. Guess what? I switched it up
and lost twenty pounds. Thank you,
universe.

The train does a collective eye roll in complete disbelief.

OMAR
This guy needs a drug test.

The Conductor goes quiet. After a few more seconds in the
dark, the train finally pulls into Grand Central.

CONDUCTOR (V.O.)
We've reached the end of the line.
Ladies and gentlemen, back to your
regularly scheduled program.

Passengers breathe a sigh of relief as the DOORS OPEN.

CONDUCTOR (V.O.)
This train is now out of service.
But remember: The universe is
talking... So slow down and listen.

Omar rises from his seat and heads to the exit. Daniel SITS a
beat, taking in the conductor’s words.
17.

INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION - MAIN CONCOURSE - CONTINUOUS

Daniel and Omar emerge from the train to find themselves in
the main concourse of Grand Central Station.

DANIEL
How much time you got before work?

OMAR
‘Bout an hour. Why?

Daniel looks to the walkways situated behind on the massive
windows overlooking the terminal.

DANIEL
It's been a while since we went up.
Today’s the perfect day.

Daniel starts to make his way through the diverse crowd of
people rushing to their trains.

DANIEL (CONT'D)
Come on!

Omar follows after Daniel, almost losing sight of him in the
pedestrian traffic.

EXT. TASHA’S HIGH SCHOOL - DAY
Tasha stands outside the fence of her school. Fighting tears.

NATASHA (V.O.)
It’s still hard for me to believe
that after today I may never see
this school again.

INSERT SHOTS: She and Bev sitting down at the courtyard
outside laughing, walking the hallways, gossiping, etc.

BACK TO SCENE: The real Bev walks up.

BEV
Please tell me you have good news.

NATASHA (V.O.)
Bev’s the closest thing I have to a
sister. The longest time we’ve ever
been apart is two weeks.

NATASHA
I wish. I was late, so they
wouldn’t let me see Ms. Whitney.
18.

BEV
(desperate)
So what does that mean? You're
leaving?! Isn’t there someone else
you can talk to?

Tasha pulls out the card.

NATASHA
I’ve got one last shot. This guy
Jeremy Fitzgerald. He’s supposed to
be some kind of immigration fixer.

BEV
Oh my God! That’s amazing!
(then)
Wait, why are you here? He should
be “fixing” this! Go!

NATASHA
I’ve got a few hours before my
appointment with him.

BEV
You should come to Chem Lab and
mess with Mr. Busby. He’s got on
his polyester mom jeans again.

NATASHA
My appointment’s uptown. I don’t
want to rush. I’m just gonna hit
the record store. Kill some time.

The bell rings.

BEV
Text me the address. I’'1l skip out
after my test and we can grab
lunch.

NATASHA
Perfect.

They share a look. Bev heads back inside. Tasha puts her
headphones on and queues up Major Lazer album. We hear GET
FREE and see it carry her worries away.

INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION - GLASS WALKWAY - DAY
Daniel and Omar chill behind the oversized windows of the

main terminal, overlooking the bustling crowd below. All of
Grand Central’s architectural glory in perfect view.
19.

DANIEL
My life’s gonna go one of two ways
after today. If I don’t get into
Yale, it’ll be Charlie all over
again. And if I do...white jackets
and picket fences from now until
eternity.

OMAR
The American Dream.

DANIEL
Even if I win, I lose. What kind of
future is that?

OMAR
If losing means you're rich, sign
me up.

DANIEL
I just wish I could do something
about it.

Daniel sighs. He turns over and lies face up on the walkway.

DANIEL (CONT'D)
There's gotta be something more to
it all than this.

His gaze catches the gigantic mural of the Universe painted
on the ceiling of the terminal.

DANIEL (CONT'D)
You ever notice that before?

OMAR
Notice what?

Off Daniel’s look, Omar joins him on the ground, eyes up. The
majesty of the mural is on full display. Several
constellations are recognizable.

DANIEL
It’s a sign.

OMAR
Oh, see now, you’re just making
stuff up. We’ve passed this thing a
million times.
20.

DANIEL
Yeah, but have you ever seen it?
It's like the conductor said on the
train, maybe the universe is trying
to tell me something.

OMAR
Yep. “You’re losing it, bro.”

DANIEL
I’m serious, Omar. Of all the days
we've been here, today is the day
that I notice the most amazing
thing in all of Grand Central? It’s
not a coincidence.

OMAR
Okay, then let’s suppose this
conductor was right...the universe
is talking. What’s it saying?

Daniel sits up, looking out into the main terminal. People
shuffle back through the concourse. He looks around, eyeing
everything in sight...nothing. A train pulls in.

DANIEL
I don’t know yet.

OMAR
Go figure.

Daniel plops down on the ground, then... He spots HER in the
crowd. A young, Black woman with an enormous, curly AFRO and
almost-as-enormous PINK HEADPHONES. It’s Natasha.

Her eyes are closed as she sways to her music, in complete
bliss. Omar notices Daniel’s gaze and shakes his head.

OMAR (CONT'D)
Now what?

(looking out)
It’s just a cute girl, Daniel.
Relax.

(double take)
Okay, she’s real cute.

Natasha walks underneath them, moving her backpack to one_
shoulder REVEALING the back of her jacket. It reads: CARPE
DIEM. Daniel’s completely struck.

DANIEL
Look at her jacket! Carpé Diem.
21.

OMAR
Carpé wha--

DANIEL
Carpé Diem... “Seize the Day.”
(off Omar, unfazed)
It's gotta be a sign. C’mon on!

Daniel drags Omar off in the direction he last saw Natasha.

EXT. NYC STREET - MOMENTS LATER
Daniel’s eyes light up as he follows Natasha from a distance.

OMAR
This is stalker-ish, you know.

DANIEL
No, it’s not. I’m maintaining a non-
creepy, half-block distance.

Tasha enters a record store. GALAXY RECORDS. Daniel stops in
his tracks. Stares at Omar.

DANIEL (CONT'D)
(re: the store’s sign)
You gotta be shitting me! This is
definitely a Sign.

OMAR
Okay. Definitely ironic. I'll give
you that... And she is cute...

DANIEL
I want to know where this leads.

OMAR,

Hopefully not to jail. But if it
does, don’t call me.

INT. GALAXY RECORD STORE - DAY
Natasha enters the record store, smiling anyway.
NATASHA (V.O.)
If today were not today, I would
spend all day here.

Tasha enters the “Rap” section. Then she sees a COUPLE making
out next to a poster of Madonna's Like a Virgin. She frowns.
22.

NATASHA (V.O.)
Ugh. Of all the people to run into,
on today of all days, why did I
have to run into my ex? Why isn’t
he in school? This is my place!

These two are ROB, 17, and KELLY, 17. Kelly snakes her hand
out and SNATCHES A RECORD. She slips it between their bodies
and into her bulky jacket. Tasha shakes her head, appalled.

DANIEL (0.S.)
She’s just going to steal that?

Tasha turns to find Daniel standing right behind her.

NATASHA
I know! Doesn’t anybody work here?
Can’t they see what’s happening?

DANIEL
Shouldn't we say something?

Tasha shakes her head.

NATASHA
(re: Rob and Kelly)
No. I know them.

DANIEL
Sticky Fingers is your friend?

NATASHA
She’s my boyfriend’s girlfriend.

DANIEL
How does that work exactly?

NATASHA
I mean ex-boyfriend. He cheated on
me. With her, actually.

NATASHA (V.O.)
TMI, Tasha. I didn’t need to
volunteer that tidbit toa

stranger.
DANIEL
Great pair.
(beat, then)

We should tell someone.
23.

NATASHA
No way! If I say something, it’s
going to look like I’m jealous and
messing with them.

DANIEL
Are you?

NATASHA
That's kind of a personal question,
isn’t it?

DANIEL

We were having a moment.

NATASHA
Were we?

Rob pauses from making out, looks up to see Tasha and Daniel
staring at them from a distance.

NATASHA (CONT’D)
Jesus Christ bleeding on a popsicle
stick...he saw me!

Rob gives Tasha a half-smile and a small wave. Tasha turns
her back to him, facing Daniel instead.

NATASHA (CONT’D)
Oh God...is he coming over here?

DANIEL
Yup.

NATASHA
Maybe we should make out or
something. Like spies do in the
movies.
Daniel blushes. Hard.
Tasha notes his blush and leans back.

NATASHA (CONT’D)
I’m not serious. Obviously.

Rob approaches them.

ROB
Hey...

DANIEL
Why are you and your girlfriend
stealing things?
24.

Rob holds his hands up and takes a step back.

ROB
Whoa, dude. Keep your voice down.

DANIEL
This is an independent record
store. That means it’s family
owned. You’re stealing from real
people. Do you know how hard it is
for small businesses to survive
when people like you just take
stuff?

Tasha spots an EMPLOYEE approach Kelly.

NATASHA
Uh...don’t look now, but I think
your girlfriend just got busted.

Rob looks over at Kelly. EMPLOYEE #2 has now joined them. Rob
shoves his hands into his pockets and walk-runs toward the
front door.

KELLY
Rob!

But Rob doesn’t stop. He bolts out, leaving her behind.

DANIEL
Damn, that was cold.

Kelly hands Employee Prince’s “Purple Rain” from under her
jacket. The employee snatches the record.

EMPLOYEE
Come back in here again and I will
call the cops.

Kelly nods, then exits quickly.

DANIEL
Well, at least she has good taste.

NATASHA
Yeah, I guess if you’re going to
steal a Prince record, might as
well be his best one, right?

DANIEL
I don’t know if that’s his best
one. Solid top three, for sure.
25.

NATASHA
Tell me, in your opinion, what is
his best album?

DANIEL
Controversy. My mom used to play
that song all the time when I was a
kid.

Tasha smiles, impressed. Daniel stares at her, googly-eyed.
Grinning.

NATASHA
Listen, Red Tie--

DANIEL
Daniel. My name is Daniel.

He sticks out his hand for a shake. Tasha shakes it. He holds
it a beat too long. A moment passes between them.

NATASHA
It was nice meeting you, Daniel.
But I really have to go--

DANIEL
Well, maybe I can walk you--

NATASHA
No, I’m good. Take care, Daniel.

Tasha puts her headphones back on and starts walking for the
door quickly, leaving Daniel standing there kicking himself.

EXT. NYC STREET - DAY

Natasha walks out into the crowd and spots Rob and Kelly up
ahead. Kelly cries as Rob gives his best half-ass
explanation. Natasha moves past them unnoticed.

Daniel, ear to his phone, eyes Tasha in the distance as he
follows her.

OMAR (V.O., ON THE PHONE)
Why didn’t you just get her number
in the record store?

DANIEL
Because she wouldn’t give it to me.

OMAR (V.O.)
I think that’s clearly a sign,
don’t you?
26.

DANIEL
But it’s not like she totally blew
me off. She was nice. I’m telling
you, there was a spark there.

OMAR (V.O.)
And following her like a serial
killer is going to reignite that?

DANIEL
I’m not following her. She just
happens to be going my way.

Natasha stops at the crosswalk ahead of Daniel.

DANIEL (CONT'D)
Oh, shit, I’m getting close. She'd
definitely think I was stalking her
if she turned around now.

OMAR (V.O.)
Well, then whatever you do, don’t --

Daniel hangs up in a panic. Strains, deciding whether to flee
or say something as he approaches. Daniel takes a deep
breath. He’s about to veer off when--

A WHITE BMW flies down the avenue. The light turns red again
and Natasha STEPS OFF THE CURB, not paying attention.

SHE’S ABOUT TO GET HIT when Daniel YANKS her backwards by her
arm. They fall backwards onto the sidewalk.

Natasha lands half on top of Daniel as her phone and
headphones CRASH AGAINST THE PAVEMENT. She looks down at the
spider webs cracking across her phone’s screen.

NATASHA
What. The. Hell?

DANIEL
You okay?

NATASHA

That guy almost killed me.

She looks up the block as the BMW sits on the side of the
road with its blinkers on. Then looks to her headphones.

NATASHA (CONT’D)
Do you know how long I’ve had
these?

Natasha cradles her broken headphones in her hands.
27.

DANIEL
I‘1l buy you another pair.

She shakes her head “no.”

DANIEL (CONT'D)
It’s the least I can do.

Tasha finally looks at him.

NATASHA
You already saved my life.

DANIEL
You wouldn't have died. A little
maimed, maybe.

Natasha stares back at him, unfazed. Her eyes fill with
tears.

NATASHA
I’m having just the worst day.
(a beat; realizing)
Wait. Were you following me?

DANIEL
Man, I knew you would think that.

NATASHA
You just happened to be right
behind me?

DANIEL
Maybe it was meant to be.

Natasha exhales deep.
NATASHA

I’m just gonna ignore that. Thanks
for your help.

DANIEL
At least tell me your name.
NATASHA
Natasha.
DANIEL
Nice name.
NATASHA

So glad you approve.

Daniel stares at her, inquisitive.
28.

NATASHA (CONT’D)
Why are you staring at me?

Daniel blushes again. Natasha stares at his face. His hair.

NATASHA (V.O.)
Observable Fact: The man-bun pushes
him from cute to kind of sexy.

DANIEL
Now you're staring.

Tasha blushes, then clears her throat.

NATASHA
Why are you wearing a suit?

DANIEL
I have an interview later. Wanna go
get something to eat?

NATASHA
What for?

DANIEL
Yale. Alumni admission interview. I
applied Early Decision.

Natasha shakes her head.

NATASHA
No, I meant why do you want to get
something to eat?

DANIEL
I’m hungry?

NATASHA
Hmmm. I’m not.

DANIEL
Coffee then? Or tea or soda or
bottled water?

NATASHA
Why?

Daniel shrugs.

DANIEL
Why not? Besides, I’m pretty sure
you owe me your life since I just
saved it.
INT. MOM AND POP COFFEE SHOP - DAY

Daniel and Tasha sit across from each other at a
Tasha checks the time on her phone: 10:00 A.M.

DANIEL
Wait. Why aren’t you in school?

NATASHA

I have a doctor’s appointment in an

Tasha sips her coffee. Silence.

Daniel fidgets nervously. Blows on his cappuccino so hard a

little foam flies up on his face. Tasha chuckles.
She then looks at his satchel, suddenly curious.

NATASHA (CONT’D)
What do you keep in there?

DANIEL
Not much. My notebook. I carry it
pretty much everywhere I go.

Daniel pulls out a black notebook. Flips through
Tasha glances at it. Sees the handwritten blocks

NATASHA
You're not a poet, are you?

DANIEL
No, I just kind of dabble in it.
For fun. Next year I‘ll be pre-med.

Self-conscious, Daniel quickly puts the notebook
bag. Tasha notices, leans in.

NATASHA
(flirting)
So what are your poems about? Love?

DANIEL
Among other things. Yes, love.

NATASHA
I don’t believe in love.

DANIEL
Well it exists, whether you believe
in it or not.

He laughs.

30.

NATASHA
Oh really? Can you prove it?

DANIEL
Thousands of love songs. Poetry.
The institution of marriage.

NATASHA
Words on paper. Never mind the fact
that eating large amounts of
chocolate has the same effect on
you as falling in love.

DANIEL
I love chocolate.

Tasha laughs, too.

DANIEL (CONT'D)
You say it’s just words on paper,
but you have to admit all those
people are feeling something.

NATASHA
People just want to believe.
Otherwise they would have to admit
that life is just a random series
of good and bad things that happen
until one day, you die.

DANIEL
And you're okay with believing that
life has no meaning?

NATASHA
I’m okay believing in the things
that science can make sense of. If
love made sense, more than forty-
eight percent of all marriages
would make it.

DANIEL
Are your parents married?

NATASHA
Yeah, but if that’s what marriage
is, it’s not for me.

DANIEL
So no fate, no magic, no meant-to-
be for you?
31.

NATASHA
Boy, please. Quantum Physics is all
the magic I need.

DANIEL
I don’t think I’ve ever met anyone
so charmingly deluded.

NATASHA
And you find that appealing?

DANIEL
I find it interesting.
(beat, then)
What if I told you I could get you
to fall in love with me
scientifically? Without chocolate.

NATASHA
I would scoff. A lot.

DANIEL
I’m serious. It’s a thing. The New
York Times had an article about it.
Researchers put a bunch of couples
in a lab and had them ask each
other a bunch of intimate
questions. Also, they had to stare
into each other’s eyes for four
minutes without talking.

NATASHA
That sounds ridiculous.

DANIEL
And yet, it’s a real thing.

Daniel and Natasha stand in line at the register, waiting to
pay. Daniel has his phone out.

DANIEL (CONT'D)
There are thirty-six questions. How
about I choose ten randomly.

NATASHA
Knock yourself out. It’s never
going to happen.

DANIEL
Great. Question number one, what
are the five key ingredients to
falling in love?
32.

NATASHA
I don’t believe in love, remember?
(off his look)
Okay. Fine--mutual self-interest
and socio-economic compatibility.

DANIEL
Do you even have a soul?

NATASHA
No such thing.

He laughs at Tasha as if she’s kidding, but she’s not.

DANIEL
Well, my ingredients are friendship
and chemistry.

NATASHA
(patronizing)
But, of course. Sorry, go on.

DANIEL
I think some kind of moral compass
is important. And let’s see...
Physical attraction and the X
factor.

NATASHA
What’s the X factor?

DANIEL
Don’t worry. We already have it.

He smiles charmingly. A strand of Daniel’s hair falls into
his face. He puts it behind his ear.

NATASHA
This quiz isn’t going to make me
fall in love with you, Red Tie.

DANIEL
It's Daniel. And give me today.
NATASHA
Can’t. I have a doctor’s
appointment.
DANIEL

Okay. I’1l walk you there.
33.

EXT. NYC STREET - DAY

Tasha leads the way, darting in and out of pedestrian
traffic, as Daniel struggles to keep up.

DANIEL
So, where are we headed?

NATASHA
I am heading to my appointment on
the east side and you are,
apparently, tagging along with me.

DANIEL
Yep. And while we’re walking...

Daniel takes out his phone.

DANIEL (CONT'D)
You ready for more questions?

NATASHA
You are relentless.

DANIEL
Persistent. Now, question number
two: Would you like to be famous

and how?
NATASHA
You first.
DANIEL
I'd be a famous poet laureate.
NATASHA
And you'd be broke.
DANIEL
Broke with money But rich with
words.
NATASHA

What does a poet laureate even do?

DANIEL
Offers wise and poetic counsel.

Tasha makes some gagging sounds.
DANIEL (CONT'D)

Be cynical all you want, but many a
life has been saved by poetry.
34.

NATASHA
You’re not joking, are you?

DANIEL
What about you? What kind of fame
do you want?

NATASHA
Easy. I'd be a benevolent dictator.

Daniel laughs.

DANIEL
You know, all dictators think
they’re benevolent. Even the ones
holding machetes.

NATASHA
Nope. Pure benevolence from me. I
would decide what was good for
everyone and do it.

DANIEL
But what if what’s good for one
person is not good for another?

NATASHA
Can’t please everyone. As my poet
laureate, you could comfort the
loser with a good poem.

DANIEL
Touché.

She glances at him, feeling a surprising connection. They
stop at a corner, waiting for the light to change.

We enter a MUSICAL MONTAGE of them walking through the city
as they get to know each other. The urban sounds melt away as
a wistful piece of music takes over. Natasha soaks up the
city she’s about to say goodbye to and Daniel continues to
try and win her full attention.

Daniel pulls out his phone again and begins scrolling through
questions. Natasha watches him.

NATASHA
Tell me again why you're wearing a
suit?
(off his groan)
Come on, I get to ask questions
too.
35.

DANIEL
Yale. Interview.

NATASHA
Really. Are you nervous?

DANIEL
I’m fine. My parents have only been
prepping me for this my entire

life.
NATASHA
They're immigrants, huh?
DANIEL
Yup.
NATASHA
Mine too. Do you even want to go to
Yale?
DANIEL

It doesn’t matter what I want.

NATASHA
It's your life.

DANIEL
And what about yours? You sound
like you’ve got it all figured out.

NATASHA
I’m going to be a data scientist.
(off his look)
Data scientists analyze data and
recommend actions based on the
results. They’re also very well-
paid.

DANIEL
That’s so practical. Have you
always known what you wanted to be?

NATASHA
Well, it wasn’t predestined. I did
research on growing fields in the
sciences. I chose one, and tada.

DANIEL
So, it’s not something you're
passionate about?

She shrugs.
36.

NATASHA
I don’t want to have to rely on
anyone or wind up working night
shifts just to make ends meet. I
can’t live off of passion any more
that I could off of love.

They climb some steps and walk along an elevated walkway.

DANIEL
It's a long life to spend doing
something you’re only ‘meh’ about.

NATASHA
It's a long life to spend chasing
dreams that aren’t real. Do you
know how many people want to be
actors or writers or rock stars? A
lot. Ninety-nine percent of them
won't make it. Zero point nine
percent of those left will barely
make any money doing it. Only the
last zero point one percent make it
big. Everybody else just wastes
their lives trying to be them.

DANIEL
Are you secretly my father?

NATASHA
Ha ha. Look, when you’re a happy
doctor making lots of money, you’ll
thank him that you didn’t become a
starving artist dreaming
pointlessly about making it big.

Tasha notices the disappointed look on Daniel's face.

NATASHA (CONT’D)
Wait, you’re not serious about the
poetry thing, are you?

DANIEL
Honestly? If I had my way, yeah.
This track I’m on is too
predictable. Yale. Medical school.
Residency. Marriage. Children.
Retirement. Nursing home. Funeral
home. Cemetery.

(then)

People have big, beautiful brains!
We invent things that fly. We are
capable of anything under the sun.
We are capable of big lives.

(MORE )
37.

DANIEL (CONT'D)
How great would it be if we all
went after the things we actually
believed in?

Their eyes meet. She’s inspired by his passion.

EXT. FITZGERALD'S BUILDING - DAY

Tasha stops in front of a glass high-rise building on lst
Ave. Its corporate design contrasts with the illustrious UN
building on the opposite side of the street. She looks up at
the building, knowing it may be her last hope.

NATASHA
So, this is me.
DANIEL
I can wait for you out here.
NATASHA
Daniel. You have an interview and I
have this... thing. This is where

we say goodbye.
Daniel falls silent for a beat.

DANIEL
Am I going to see you again?

NATASHA
There are eight and a half million
people in this city. Unless we just
happen to run into one another,
again the odds aren’t in our favor.

DANIEL
Let’s do that over. Do you want to
see me again?

A beat. Neither one moves...
Daniel doesn’t wait for her reply.
DANIEL (CONT'D)
Never mind. I can see that you're a
little stressed by this
appointment...like I was before I
saw you. Let’s try something.
Daniel raises his arms laterally, away from his body.

DANIEL (CONT'D)
Lift your arms like this.
38.

Natasha obliges, reluctantly. Daniel inches closer and closer
to her, arms out.

NATASHA
Ummm. What are you doing?

DANIEL
They say that something as simple
as a hug can do wonders for stress.

NATASHA
Do they?

DANIEL
Mmmhmm, it’s science.

Daniel stands face to face with Natasha, both of their arms
outstretched, almost wrapping around one another. But they
don’t touch.

DANIEL (CONT'D)
If this is goodbye, then let this
hug be my parting gift. Okay?

Tasha pulls him in. He holds her tight. Tasha lets her head
drop onto his shoulder and her body relax into his arms.

NATASHA (V.O.)
Go, Tasha. Time to go.

DANIEL (V.O.)
Let go, Daniel. Let her go.

Daniel releases her. Tasha pulls back, smiles at him.
NATASHA
Nice meeting you, Daniel. Good luck
with your interview.
Daniel nods. Tasha heads to the building.
DANIEL
(calling after her)
You really don’t think we’ll see
each other again, do you?
She turns back to Daniel.

NATASHA
It’s highly unlikely.
39.

DANIEL
The odds were that we'd never meet
in the first place, you know. But
we did.

Daniel looks to the sky. Cracks a smile.

NATASHA
Why are you smiling?

DANIEL
Because I know this isn’t our last
time together.
Daniel’s naiveté upsets Tasha. Tears gather in her eyes.

NATASHA
Goodbye, Daniel.

Tasha turns away from him so that he can’t see her face. She
walks through the large glass doors of the building.

INT. BUILDING - HALLWAY/FITZGERALD’S OFFICE - DAY

Tasha opens a door to find a partially built office. The
walls are half painted and bare bulbs hang from the ceiling.

Sawdust and paint splotches cover the tarped floor.

A woman, HANNAH, 30s, sits behind the desk. She smiles as
Tasha approaches.

HANNAH
You must be Natasha.

Tasha nods.

HANNAH (CONT'D)
I’m sorry, I have some bad news.

Tasha’s stomach folds in on itself.

HANNAH (CONT'D)
Jeremy-- Attorney Fitzgerald, was
in a car accident an hour ago.

Hannah continues the story as Tasha listens.

NATASHA (V.O.)
Turns out that BMW that almost hit
me had already done its fair share
of damage...
40.

EXT. NEW YORK STREET - EARLIER
JEREMY FITZGERALD crosses the street.

NATASHA (V.O.)

My attorney-to-be was crossing the
street, and without his own
personal Daniel to save him...

BOOM. The WHITE BMW cruises through a stoplight and KNOCKS
JEREMY TO THE GROUND.

NATASHA (V.O.)
A drunk and distraught insurance
actuary hit him.

Jeremy crawls to the side of the street as other PEDESTRIANS
help him up and call 911.

INT. FITZGERALD'S OFFICE - PRESENT
Hannah continues talking to Tasha.

HANNAH
His wife says he’s fine, just a few
bruises. But he won’t be back until
later this afternoon.

NATASHA
But that might be too late--

HANNAH
Didn't you hear what I said? He was
hit by a car. He’ll see you later.

Hannah pushes a sheaf of forms over to Tasha.

HANNAH (CONT'D)
In the meantime, I need you to fill
out these forms.

Hannah points Tasha to an adjacent desk. She fills most of it
quickly. Then pauses at the back page. The prompt: “PLEASE
GIVE A FULL ACCOUNTING OF YOUR TIME IN THE UNITED STATES.”

NATASHA (V.O.)

I have no idea what to write. So I
give the facts: my family traveled
to America on a tourist visa and we
have not left the country since. We
have committed no crimes, except
for my dad’s DUI.
41.

Tasha jots this down quickly, then hands the papers back to
Hannah. Hannah flips through it, then stops on the back page.

HANNAH
You need more here.

NATASHA
Like what?

HANNAH

What does America mean to you? Why
do you want to stay?

NATASHA
Is that really--

HANNAH
Anything Jeremy can use to humanize
you will help.

Tasha sits back down. The phone rings as she stares at the
blank page. Struggling. Hannah talks as Tasha tries to focus.

A second phone line rings as Tasha works on the forms. Hannah
hangs up and grabs the second line before it can ring twice.

HANNAH (CONT'D)
Oh my God, Jeremy. Are you alright?

As Jeremy responds, a relieved smile crosses Hannah’s face.

HANNAH (CONT'D)

Thank goodness, I was worried sick!
(beat)

Yes, of course. I'll see you later.

Hannah hangs up the phone and comes back into the reception
area, aglow with relief.

HANNAH (CONT'D)
He’s alright.

NATASHA
That’s great.

Hannah takes the forms from Tasha and reads through them.
HANNAH
I’ve seen lots of cases like this--
you'll be okay.

NATASHA
You think so?
42.

HANNAH
Jeremy never loses. I’m not
supposed to say this...but just
know there’s hope.

Tasha exhales, a burden lifted.

INT. FITZGERALD’S BUILDING - LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER
Tasha exits the elevator.

VOICE (0.S8.)
Hey!

Tasha turns to the voice. It’s Bev.

BEV
How'd it go?

NATASHA
Good. I think.

BEV
What does that mean?

NATASHA
Well, it’s not official yet, but...
there may be something other than
resigned dread in my future.

Bev squeals, then squeezes Tasha tight in a hug.

BEV
That's amazing! Are you going to
call your parents?

NATASHA
And say what? A man who I don’t
know sent me to see another man I
don’t know. Then a paralegal, who
is not a lawyer, whom I also don’t
know, says everything will be all
right. What’s the use in getting
all our hopes up?

BEV
Hope seems like a good substitute
to whatever you’ve been feeling.

Tasha smiles.
43.

BEV (CONT'D)

Don’t tell me. Can you use the
scientific method on it? Can you
observe it, measure it, experiment
with it and repeat your
experiments?

NATASHA & BEV
You cannot.

They both laugh.

NATASHA
You know I can only take so much
positivity.
(beat)
But there is something measurable I
have to tell you. I met a boy...

BEV
Um, what? When? Deets please!

NATASHA
Okay, so I saw Rob up at Second
Coming this morning...

As Tasha tells her story, INSERT FLASHBACK SHOTS of Daniel
enhanced by her memory and favorable shades of lighting:

- Beautifully backlit after he saved Tasha’s life.

- Getting foam on his nose at the coffee spot.

- Lovingly looking at her as he says “goodbye.”

NATASHA (V.O.)
And as I gave Bev the full Daniel
rundown, it hit me...

NATASHA

I didn’t even get his full name!
BEV

What a fail.
NATASHA

I know! I should’ve gotten his

number.
Tasha looks down to her phone. It’s 11:35.

NATASHA (CONT’D)
I mean, what if this immigration
nonsense does resolve itself? How
will I find him again?
44,

BEV
Maybe he waited for you. Wouldn't
that be romantic?

Bev looks around the lobby, searching.

NATASHA
Don’t be ridiculous. He had an
interview. He’s not still here.

In spite of herself, Tasha starts to look around the lobby
too. Hopeful. But she can’t find him. Her shoulders slump.

BEV
Ha! You’re disappointed.

NATASHA
And how is that funny?

BEV
Because you really like this dude!
I’ve never seen you like this.

NATASHA
(still searching the
lobby)
Please. It’s not like I think we
were meant to be or anything
ridiculous like that...just saying,
it would've been nice--

Tasha finally sees Daniel. He’s crossing the lobby, making a
beeline for her. She covers her excitement.

DANIEL
Hey.

NATASHA
Hey. What happened to your
interview?

DANIEL
No hug. No “I’m so happy to see
you"?

BEV

You clearly don’t know Tasha that
well. Hi, I’m Bev. You must be "the
boy.”

Tasha cuts her eyes at Bev, deadly.

DANIEL
Actually it’s Daniel.
45.

BEV

Nice to meet you, Daniel.
(to Tasha)
Okay. I’m out.

Bev hugs Tasha.

NATASHA
I thought we were having lunch.

BEV
I think you’ve got other plans.

Bev grins from ear to ear as she trots off. She types Tasha a
text: Call me later. PS, pls get the digits this time!!!
Tasha turns to a smiling Daniel.

NATASHA
So?

DANIEL
So?

NATASHA

Your interview?

DANIEL
Oh, that old thing? I postponed it.

NATASHA
Are you insane? This is your life
we're talking about.

DANIEL
I didn’t burn the building to the
ground, ‘Tash. I just moved it
until later.

NATASHA
‘Tash? We're doing nicknames
already?

EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

Tasha shivers a little and rubs her hands down her forearms
from the cold. Daniel takes her jacket and helps her into it.

NATASHA
Did you postpone for me?

DANIEL
Absolutely.
46.

NATASHA
What makes you so sure I’m worth
it?

DANIEL

Instinct. How did your thing go?

NATASHA
Fine. I have to come back at 3:30.

Daniel looks at his phone: 11:45 AM.

DANIEL
Looks like we have more time
together.

NATASHA

Looks that way, huh?
The two of them exchange flirty smiles.

NATASHA (CONT’D)
So, what should we do now?

EXT. HARLEM - MLK BLVD DAY

The Manhattan skyscrapers have been replaced by small,
closely-packed stores with bright awnings. Harlem feels less
like a city and more like a neighborhood. Almost everyone's
black. Tasha and Daniel walk down the street, talking.

NATASHA
Your father owns a black hair care
shop called “Black Hair Care”?

DANIEL
Yep. Not the most creative name in
the world, I’1l give you that.

NATASHA
Hmm. I guess when you said ‘store,’
that’s not what I was expecting.
How'd they get into that?

INT. STILL PHOTO SEQUENCE - FANTASY
DANIEL (V.O.)
My family didn’t enter the Black

hair care business by chance.

A STILL PHOTO OF DANIEL’S FAMILY COMES TO LIFE.

DANIEL (V.O.)
When Dae Hyun and Min Soo moved to
New York, Dae Hyun’s cousin gave
them a loan to open a Black Hair
Care store.

A photograph of a Korean plane suddenly moves, the plane
lands in New York City. A photo of Dae Hyun’s COUSIN springs
into action as he hands Daniel’s parents some cash. A Hair
Care Store frozen in time suddenly bustles.

DANIEL (V.O.)
His cousin had a similar store and
it was thriving. As were stores
other South Koreans had opened up.

A wide shot reveals the cousin in front of a store, he goes
inside. A dozen other Black Hair Care Stores are alive and
thriving on the block.

DANIEL (V.O.)
And South Koreans didn’t dominate
the Black hair care industry by
chance. In the 1960s wigs made with
South Korean hair were insanely
popular in the African-American
community.

Various photographs of BLACK WOMEN come to life. As they walk
down the street, wigs of every style are on display.

DANIEL
So much so that the South Korean
government banned the export of raw
hair to ensure South Korean wigs
could only be made in South Korea.
That combined with the U.S. banning
the import of wigs containing
Chinese hair effectively solidified
South Korea’s dominance in the wig
market. The wig business evolved to
the more general Black hair care
business. Of which South Koreans
currently control 60-80%.

BACK TO SCENE - EXT. HARLEM STREET - DAY

They finally stop in front of his father’s store. Posters of
BLACK WOMEN in all styles--afros, weaves, braids, etc., adorn
the windows.

DANIEL (CONT'D)
So this is it...
48.

Daniel turns to Tasha, tugs his tie from side to side
nervously.

DANIEL (CONT'D)
So, you should know that my dad’s
really...

NATASHA
Daniel. It’s fine. I get it. All
parents are embarrassing.

Daniel averts his eyes. Tasha reaches out for the door, but
he stops her.

DANIEL
Maybe you could just wait out here.

Tasha lets the door go, stunned. Daniel reaches for the door.

DANIEL (CONT'D)
I‘ll be right back.

He sees the hurt in Tasha’s eyes, feels awful.

DANIEL (CONT'D)
I’m sorry, can I try that again?

Tasha gives him a big smile. Daniel opens the door for Tasha.

DANIEL (CONT'D)
After you.

INT. BLACK HAIR CARE STORE - DAY

A bell chimes as they enter. It’s small and crammed with rows
of metal shelves and products. Dae, DAE HYUN, 50s, is busy
ringing up a customer at the register.

DANIEL
Well, this is it... You need to go
to the bathroom or anything?
There's one in the back.

Tasha shakes her head. He strangles the pouch with his hands.
Nervous.

NATASHA
Want to show me around?

DANIEL
Not much to see. First two aisles

are for hair.
(MORE )
49.

DANIEL (CONT'D)
Shampoo, conditioner, extensions,
dyes, lots of chemical things I
don’t understand. Aisle three is
make-up. Four’s equipment.

He glances at his dad, but he’s still busy.

DANIEL (CONT'D)
Do you need something?

Tasha touches her hair, suddenly insecure.

DANIEL (CONT'D)
I didn’t mean a product. We have a
fridge in the back with soda and
stuff.

NATASHA
Sure.

They walk down the hair dye aisle. Tasha stops in front of
some boxes with brightly colored dyes, picks up a pink one.

DANIEL
Pink?

NATASHA
Why not?

DANIEL

Doesn't seem like your style.

NATASHA
Shows how much you know.

DANIEL
I think you would look beautiful
with a giant pink afro.

NATASHA
The whole thing wouldn’t be pink.
Maybe just the ends.

He reaches for the box and now they’re both holding it and
facing each other in an aisle that only has space for one.

DANIEL
It would look like strawberry
frosting.

Daniel pulls a few strands of Tasha’s coils. He smiles. She
smiles back. A small moment.
50.

CHARLIE (0.S.)
Oh, look. My little brother’s here.

Daniel jerks his hand from her hair. They both let go of the
dye at the same time, and the box clatters to the floor.

Charlie saunters down the aisle toward them, eyes filled with
curiosity and a mischievous glee.

Daniel hands the dye back to Tasha.

DANIEL
What’s up, Charlie?

CHARLIE
The sky is up, little brother.
(then, re: Tasha)
Who is this?

Charlie’s eyes are on Tasha. Daniel takes a deep breath and
readies himself to say something, but Tasha jumps in.

NATASHA
I'm Natasha. A friend of your
brother's.

CHARLIE
Oh, I thought maybe he’d caught a
shoplifter. We get a lot of those
in a store like this. I’m sure you
understand.

Tasha’s eyes widen, stunned by his rudeness.

DANIEL
Jesus Christ, Charlie.

Daniel angrily takes a step toward his brother, but Tasha
grabs his hand, pulling him back. Daniel stops, links his
fingers with hers and squeezes.

Charlie makes a big show of looking down at their joined
hands and then back up at them.

CHARLIE
Is this what I think it is?

He claps his hands together with a loud smack and does a
laughing two-step dance.

CHARLIE (CONT'D)
This. Is. Great. Yes. You know what
this means don’t you? All the heat

will be off me.
(MORE )
51.

CHARLIE (CONT'D)
When the ‘rents find out about this
I’‘1l be a boy scout again. Fuck
academic probation.

NATASHA
Wow. You’re an asshole.

He smiles as if Tasha’s paid him a compliment.

NATASHA (CONT’D)
(to Daniel)
Do your thing and let’s get out of
here.

She squeezes his hand. They turn away and run right into his
father. Tasha pulls her hand away, but it’s too late.

DAE
(in Korean)
What are you doing?

DANIEL
Mom said I had to bring you this.
CHARLIE
Want me to help translate for your
friend?
DAE
(to Charlie)
I thought you didn’t understand
Korean.
Charlie shrugs.
CHARLIE
I get by.
DAE

(in Korean)
Is that why you failed out of
school? You only get by?

Charlie’s smile lessens. Embarrassment showing.

CHARLIE
(to Tasha)
Don’t worry, he’s not talking about
you. Not yet at least.

Dae’s face goes completely blank. He suppresses his anger and
feigns a smile at Tasha.
52.

DAE
You want something before you
leave?

He clasps his hands, half-bends at the waist like he usually
does for his customers.

NATASHA
No, thank you, Mr.--

DAE
Yes. Yes. You’re a friend of
Daniel’s. Take anything you want.

He pats at his pockets until he finds his glasses and peers
at the bottles on the shelf.

DAE (CONT'D)
Not this aisle. Come with me.

Natasha and Daniel follow him helplessly while Charlie
snickers. Dae finds what he’s looking for one aisle over.

DAE (CONT'D)
Here. A relaxer for your hair. To
make your hair not so big.

He pulls a tub from a shelf and hands it to her. Charlie
laughs long and loud.

NATASHA
Thank you, Mr.--

DANIEL
Bae.

NATASHA

Mr. Bae. I don’t need any--

DAE
Your hair’s too big.

NATASHA
I like it big.

CHARLIE
Better get a different boyfriend.

Daniel glares at his brother.

DANIEL
We're leaving.
53.

Daniel practically flings the pouch at his father. Then he
reaches for Tasha’s hand and leads her toward the door.

CHARLIE
Thank you, come again.

EXT. HARLEM - CONTINUOUS
CHYRON: 12:15PM

Daniel sighs as he tugs Tasha up the block. She shakes her
head. Daniel finally stops, hangs his head.

DANIEL
I’m sorry.

Tasha’s giggles turn into all-out laughter. She clutches her
stomach as Daniel stares at her, unamused.

NATASHA
I don’t think that could've gone
any worse. Racist dad. Racist and
sexist older brother. And the
store! I mean the ancient posters
of those women and your dad
offering me a relaxer.

DANIEL
I’m glad you think this is funny.

NATASHA
Come on. Tragedy is funny.

DANIEL
Are we in a tragedy?

NATASHA
Of course. Isn’t that what life is?
We all die at the end.

DANIEL
I guess so.

He steps closer, takes her hand and places it on his chest.

DANIEL (CONT'D)
Seriously. I’m sorry. I’m sorry
about my family. I’m sorry about
everything, about the whole history
of the world and all its racism and
the unfairness of all of it.
54.

NATASHA
What are you even saying? It’s not
your fault. You can’t apologize for
racism.

DANIEL
I can and I do.

Tasha warms to his earnestness.

NATASHA
I get it. It’s hard to come from
some place or someone that you’re
not proud of... But you’re not your
dad. Or your brother thankfully.

DANIEL
Thank you.
(beat)
I feel like I need a palate
cleanser now. What’s your favorite
place to go in the city?

NATASHA
Hmm. There’s so many. But I guess
if I had to pick one, I’d say the
planetarium.

DANIEL
Really? Never been.

NATASHA
Are you serious? Not even the
obligatory fourth grade field trip?
Daniel shakes his head. Tasha looks at her phone.
NATASHA (CONT’D)
Then we have to go. There’s a

twelve-thirty show if we leave now,
we can make it.

INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - LATER

Daniel and Tasha sit side by side.

DANIEL
So, you ready for the next
question?

NATASHA

Oh boy...are we back to that?
55.

DANIEL
I‘ll take that as a yes.
(searches)
Alright, here we go. How do you
feel about your relationship with
your mother and father?

NATASHA
You first.

DANIEL

Well. You met my dad...it’s
complicated. Of course I love him,
but you can love someone and still
have a not-so-great relationship
with them, you know?

(shrugs)
Sometimes I feel like we’re on
opposite sides of a soundproofed,
glass wall. We can see each other
but we can’t hear each other.

The train brakes suddenly and jostles them even closer

together.

She doesn’t move away.

NATASHA
And your mom?

DANIEL
Pretty good. She’s kind of like me.
She paints.

NATASHA
So she’s a delusional optimist too?

DANIEL
I guess so.
(then)
Now your turn.

Tasha rolls her eyes.

She nods.

DANIEL (CONT'D)
I‘1l make it easy on you. You can
just give me a thumbs up or thumbs
down, okay?

DANIEL (CONT'D)
Mom?

Tasha gives the thumbs up.
56.

DANIEL (CONT'D)
Way up?

NATASHA
Let’s not go overboard. I’m
seventeen and she’s my mom.

DANIEL
Dad?

Tasha gives the thumbs down.

DANIEL (CONT'D)
Way down?

NATASHA
(beat)
It’s hard to love someone who
doesn’t love you back.

Daniel and Tasha fall silent as a STREET MUSICIAN carrying a
VIOLIN boards the car. She starts to play Prince’s “When
Doves Cry.”

Daniel nudges Tasha.
DANIEL

She’s playing Prince. Kind of a

coincidence, don’t you think?
Tasha rolls her eyes.
The Musician is so passionate and the tune is so infectious
that an ELDERLY PASSENGER starts to loudly hum along. As the
song goes on, OTHER PASSENGERS hum as well.

Daniel smiles big at Tasha as he joins in.

NATASHA
You're so goofy.

The Musician finishes with a flourish and the car breaks out
in applause. A true New York subway Moment.

The Musician takes a bow.

STREET MUSICIAN
Ladies and gentlemen, if you like
what you heard, I do accept tips.
Cash, credit or debit.

The Musician holds her hat in one hand and an iPhone with a
card-reading square in the other as passengers head out.
57.

Tasha stops, pulls out a dollar and puts it in her hat.
Daniel smiles and does the same.

INT. MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY - HALL OF METEORITES - DAY

Tasha and Daniel wander through the minimal dark space.
Spotlights shine on Meteorites. Natasha runs her hand across
the metal-cold surface of a pockmarked rock and ske closes
her eyes, fingering the divots. Daniel comes close, watching
her. She turns to him, her voice a whisper.

NATASHA
This rock is 4.5 Billion years old.
Almost as old as our solar system.

Daniel smiles.

NATASHA (CONT’D)
Just think about that, before
humans ever existed, this object
was flying through the universe for
billions of years!

Daniel pauses, taken aback by her.

DANIEL
You’re like a kid in a candy store.

NATASHA
Just think, humans have only been
around for at most two-hundred-
thousand years. This rock has been
around for five-thousand times as
long as all of human history
combined.

DANIEL

The way you talk about this stuff,

you should be pursuing astronomy.

Natasha walks off into the darkness of the exhibition space.

NATASHA

There’s not a lot of jobs in

astronomy. Not like the other

sciences.

Daniel follows her, pauses in a pool of light.

DANIEL
But this is what you love.

Natasha stands in the darkness, just outside the spotlight.
58.

NATASHA
Cliche as it sounds, love doesn’t
put food on the table.
(then)
Isn’t that why you’re going to
Yale?

DANIEL
I don’t know how it is with your
family, but in mine, my parents
have a lot of power. And they've
already decided my fate.

Daniel walks back into the blackness. Tasha follows him. She
looks at her watch.

NATASHA
Show’s about to start.

INT. MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY - PLANETARIUM THEATER - LATER

The night sky is projected on an ENORMOUS SCREEN. Tasha and
Daniel stare up at the stars, transfixed.

NARRATOR (V.O.)
The night sky... both beautiful and
mysterious.

Images of the Milky Way galaxy appear.

NARRATOR (V.O.)
But the stars only tell part of the
story. You see this denser band of
stars? That’s the Milky Way. It's
our galaxy.

Daniel’s eyes go wide as he takes in the spectacle. Tasha
notes his reaction and smiles to herself.

NARRATOR (V.O.)
It's big. So big that even at the
speed of light it would take
100,000 years to travel across it.
And this galaxy of ours contains
only about 100 billion stars.

The two of them are so caught up that everyone DISAPPEARS
around them.

NARRATOR (V.O.)
Luckily the Milky Way is not the
only galaxy in the Universe.
(MORE )
59.

NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Many of the stars we see are
actually in whole other galaxies
very far away.

Daniel eyes Tasha’s hand on her lap.

NARRATOR (V.O.)
There are about 170 billion
galaxies, comprised of hundreds of
billions of individual stars.

Natasha’s elbow lightly brushes Daniel’s arm. She notices and
they exchange a look, both embarrassed.

NARRATOR (V.O.)
There are more stars in the
universe than grains of sand on all
of Earth’s beaches combined.

Daniel looks down longingly at her hand. Reaches his pinky
slowly towards hers.

NARRATOR (V.O.)
Some may find this vastness, this
unending darkness, proof of our
insignificance. But I see ita
little differently.

Daniel’s pinky lightly touches her hand. A pause. Natasha
freezes. Daniel withdraws his hand quickly.

NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON appears on screen, as if he’s standing in
the middle of the universe. He’s our narrator.

TYSON (V.O.)
The most astounding fact to me is
the knowledge that the atoms that
comprise life on earth, the atoms
that make up our human bodies, are
traceable to the stars.

Daniel takes a deep breath, slowly brings his hand towards
Natasha’s hand again.

TYSON (V.O.)
Stars that collapsed and then
exploded, they became the
ingredients for life itself.

Daniel’s fingers lightly cover Natasha’s fingers. A pause,
his hand on hers.
60.

TYSON (V.O.)
So when we look up at the night
sky, we aren’t drawn in merely for
its beauty...we’re drawn in because
whether we know it or not, we are
all part of this universe, we are
all in this universe, but more
importantly, the universe is in
uS...

Natasha reciprocates at last. She pulls her fingers around
his and their hands intertwine. The tension building...

INT. MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY - PLANETARIUM THEATER - LATER

The lights are up. Daniel’s still blown away by what they
just saw. Tasha’s distant. Both of them remain in their
seats.

DANIEL
That was...really something.

Tasha doesn’t hear him. She checks the time on her phone
again: 1:01 PM. She slides her hand away from Daniel's.

DANIEL (CONT'D)
Did I say something wrong?

NATASHA
No, it’s not you. Well, maybe it
is...Don’t you think it’s weird
that we've spent so much time
together today? I mean, we just
met. We’re practically strangers.

DANIEL
Honestly, I don’t think it’s weird
at all. Plus, you’ve met my
family...we’re definitely out of
the stranger zone.

Natasha softens. At ease.

NATASHA
Yeah, I guess. It’s just a lot to
take in.

DANIEL

I don’t know...I just feel
connected to you.

A beat. Natasha’s belly growls. Their laughter relieves the
romantic tension.
61.

DANIEL (CONT'D)
You like Korean food?

EXT. KOREAN MARKETPLACE - DAY

Music plays as Daniel and Tasha make their way through the
densely packed streets of Koreatown. Neon signs in Korean,
street vendors, bicycles, and the smell of delicious food
wafting in the air.

Natasha sees Korean people exiting a building dragging big
suitcases. She SIGHS, the weight of the world on her
shoulders. Daniel notices. She brushes it off, moving on down
the street. They take a quick SELFIE together as the music
ends.

NATASHA
So how come you call yourself
Korean? Weren’t you born here?

DANIEL
People always ask where I’m from. I
used to say here, but then they ask
where are you really from, and then
I say Korea.

NATASHA
I don’t think you should say you’re
from Korea.

DANIEL
Why not?

NATASHA
Because it’s not true. You’re from
here.

DANIEL

I love how simple this is for you.

NATASHA
What do you mean?

DANIEL
Well, your solution to everything
is to tell the truth. I struggle
with my identity and you tell me
just to say what’s true.

NATASHA
Why not? It’s not up to you to help
other people fit you into a box.
62.

DANIEL
Do people do it to you?

NATASHA
Yeah, except I’m really not from
here. We left Jamaica when I was
eight. The first time I saw snow, I
was in homeroom and I was so amazed
I stood up to stare at it.

DANIEL
Oh no.
NATASHA
Oh yes.
DANIEL
Did the other kids--
NATASHA
Yep. It wasn’t pretty.
(shrugs)

But eventually this became home. I
love it here. I could stay in New
York for the rest of my life.

DANIEL
Well, you should.

Natasha deflects.

NATASHA
Well I’m not going to be around
much longer... You know, if I don’t

get some food soon. Where are we
going again?

Daniel stops in his tracks. Tasha follows his lead.

DANIEL
Turn around.

The pair stand at a nondescript doorway. Confused, Tasha
looks to Daniel.

DANIEL (CONT'D)
Trust me.

He takes her hand and they head inside, the sound of people
greeting them in Korean “Annyeonghaseyo” echoes.
63.

INT. KOREAN RESTAURANT - DAY

Daniel and Tasha sit at a booth in a small hole-in-the-wall
joint. Tasha looks over the menu.

DANIEL
What do you think?

NATASHA
I’1l eat whatever you tell me to.

Daniel rings the little bell attached to the table and a
WAITRESS appears almost instantly. She gives Natasha a quick
look, turns to Daniel.

WAITRESS
(in Korean)
How can I help you?

DANIEL
(in Korean)
We'll have two seafood soon dubu,
kalbi, and pa jun.

The waitress nods and then walks off.

NATASHA
There’s a bell?

DANIEL
Awesome, right? It takes all the
mystery out of food service. When
will my waiter appear? When will I
get the check?

NATASHA
Do American restaurants know about
this? Bells should be mandatory.

Daniel laughs.

NATASHA (CONT’D)
No, I changed my mind. Can you
imagine some jerk just leaning on
the bell demanding ketchup?

The Waitress returns and places the soup and two uncooked
eggs on the table. She tosses paper-clad spoons and
chopsticks into the center of the table.

NATASHA (CONT’D)
Oh, can I have a fork, please?

The Waitress gives her a disapproving look, then walks off.
64.

NATASHA (CONT’D)
Does this mean she’s not going to
bring me a fork?

Daniel laughs.

DANIEL
Don’t worry about her. Try this...

Daniel pulls the soup bowl towards him.

DANIEL (CONT'D)
This is soon dubu.

Tasha watches as he cracks the egg into the soup. She does
the same, then dips her spoon in and takes a bite.

NATASHA
Mmm. It’s delicious.

Daniel smiles as Tasha does a little happy dance. He watches
her eat, amused. A stream of traffic flowing through a door
in the rear of the restaurant catches Tasha’s eye.

NATASHA (CONT’D)
What’s going on back there? This
some kind of Korean mafia joint?

DANIEL
Oh, no. That’s the norebang.
(off her look)
Korean karaoke.

NATASHA
Then why don’t I hear any music?

DANIEL
They have private rooms. Koreans
are all about embarrassing
themselves in private.

A beat, then a mischievous look comes over Daniel’s face.
NATASHA

Why are you looking at me like
that?

INT. NOREBANG - PRIVATE ROOM - NIGHT

 

A small, dimly lit room. Plush, red leather couches. A large,
square coffee table sits in front of the couch. On it, a
microphone and a remote. Next to the door there’s a large TV.
65.

Daniel pours over the thick song book, he’s been flipping for
a while, agonizing over it. Natasha watches him.

NATASHA
Just choose a song.

DANIEL
This is norebang. You don’t choose
a song. A song chooses you.

NATASHA
How poetic.

DANIEL
Isn’t it?

NATASHA
I don’t know, most poems I’ve read
are about three things: love, sex,
or the stars. You poets are
obsessed with stars. Falling stars.
Shooting stars. Dying stars.

DANIEL
Stars are important.

NATASHA
Sure, but why not more poems about
the sun? The sun is also a star and
it’s the most important one. That
alone should be worth a poem or
two.

DANIEL
Being the most important star
doesn’t make it the most poetic.
Who wants to write about something
so domineering? I’d rather ruminate
on the romantic underdogs that play
in the night sky.

NATASHA
Domineering? You’ve got it all
wrong. The sun is a benevolent
star. A giver...it’s also our
greatest symbol of hope.

DANIEL
How’s that?

NATASHA
The brightest stars that we see at
night are often the light from
stars that have already died.
(MORE )
66.

NATASHA (CONT'D)
It's sad, really. But the sun is
different. Everyday it brings
energy and life and hope to us.
Without it, we’d all be lost. I
think that’s something worth
writing about.

DANIEL
Hope, huh? I never pegged you to
believe in something as intangible
as hope.

NATASHA
Just a manner of speech. It only
means that something is possible.
The sun makes everything on earth
possible.

DANIEL
You know what? You’re right. I will
only write poems about the sun from

now on...
NATASHA
Good.
DANIEL
And sex.

Natasha rolls her eyes. He winks. Then starts flipping
through the book. He pulls the rubber hand from his hair and
tosses it on the table. Tasha tries not to stare.

NATASHA
Are you a good singer?

DANIEL
Not gonna lie. I am kinda good.

He grabs the remote to key in his song choice. Tasha smiles.

The music starts and Daniel slowly settles into a dramatic
slump: feet planted wide, hair obscuring his bowed head and
microphone held high in the air, ready to rock.

The opening chords of “Kiss” by Prince fill the room. He puts
a hand over his heart and croons the first verse. It’s
Magnetic. As the song unfolds he embodies Princes’ sexual
power in a completely fun and charming performance.

As Daniel’s sings, Tasha’s imagination takes over. BEGIN
FANTASY MONTAGE:
67.

--Daniel and Tasha months down the road: lying in bed
together laughing and eating cookies, Daniel playing Soccer
with Tasha’s brother, Daniel and Tasha wandering Ellis Island
together holding hands. And then years down the road, Daniel
on one knee holding a ring out to a glowing Tasha. Walking
down the aisle, cooking breakfast pregnant, pushing a
stroller down the streets of New York arm and arm. The
fantasy is of a whole life with Daniel, a beautiful life.

Daniel leans in while the songs plays without him and a
cheesy guide track keeps crooning. They kiss. IN the middle
of the cheesiest and most epic tiny room in the universe.

ON CELL SCREEN: MEETING WITH FITZGERALD IN 30 MINUTES.

She pulls away and stares intently at the message. It fills
her with panic and dread. She’s not going to marry anyone.
She’s not going to have kids with Daniel. This is all a sham.
Her life is over, not starting. Daniel see her shift in
attitude.

DANIEL (CONT'D)
Everything okay?

Tasha stares at him with fear and protective anger in her
eyes. She almost whispers.

NATASHA
I gotta go.

She then bolts out of the room.

Tasha runs down the crazy hallways filled with colored lights
and crazy patterns. Neon flashing in her face as she wells up
with tears.

DANIEL
Hey - what are you doing?

NATASHA
I’m sorry. I gotta go.

DANIEL
Woah! Wait! What are you sorry for?

NATASHA
I just have to go. This all has to
stop Daniel.

Daniel chases her down the hall and she starts to run harder
when she eyes a door at the end of a long hallway. She slams
into the door at full speed.
68.

EXT. NOREBANG/NEW YORK STREET - DAY

Tasha and Daniel squint and shield their eyes as they crash
out into the sunlight.

DANIEL
God, it’s bright out.

NATASHA
Back to reality.

With tears still in her eyes Tasha strides down the sidewalk
clearly to get away from everything.

DANIEL
Wait, what just happened?

NATASHA
Nothing happened.

DANIEL
Bullshit. You’re acting completely
different. What changed?

NATASHA
Nothing’s changed.

Daniel catches up to her and Tasha looks away.

DANIEL
What are you so afraid of?

NATASHA
What are you talking about?

DANIEL
There’s something real here. I know
you feel it too.

NATASHA
Oh, you know how I feel? Do you?
You don’t know shit Daniel.

DANIEL
What’s your problem?

NATASHA
This. You and me. This thing. Well
this can’t happen. It’s over ok.

DANIEL
Hey don’t I have a say in this. I
know there's something here.
69.

Natasha leans in and speaks low, with intesity.

NATASHA

Oh, well do you know that I’m not a
citizen? Huh? So you know that my
family is being deported tomorrow?
Huh do you know that? Do you know
that all this - whatever it is. It
NOT meant to be. Do you know that
part?

Daniel stares, silent. Totally blindsided.

DANIEL
What? You’re leaving the country?
Why didn’t you tell me. It’s like
this is all a lie?!

NATASHA
I didn't lie to you. I just didn’t
tell you everything.

DANIEL
I postponed my appointment because
of you!

NATASHA

I didn't ask you to do that.

DANIEL
But you didn’t say you’d be living
in another country in less than
twenty-four hours, either.

NATASHA
It wasn’t your business.

DANIEL
And it is now?

NATASHA
Look, Daniel. I told you not to
fall for me, okay? I tried.

DANIEL
No, here’s how you try. You open
your mouth and you say the truth.
Just say, “Daniel, I’m leaving the
country.” “Daniel, don’t fall in
love with me.”

NATASHA
You think a few kisses mean
something?
70.

DANIEL
I think those kisses did.

NATASHA
Lets just end this. You have your
plans and I have mine.

DANIEL
Sure. Whatever. I get it. Just like
that. OK, Have a nice life.

Daniel grabs his jacket and strides away. Tasha watches him
go.

INT. BLACK HAIR CARE STORE - DAY

Daniel walks into the store visibly upset. His dad’s busy
with a customer. Charlie’s face goes into a full asshole
smirk as he sees Daniel is alone.

CHARLIE
Where's your girlfriend? She dump
you already?

DANIEL
Fuck you, Charlie.

Charlie stops smirking, takes a good look at Daniel, noting
his tie and jacket are missing. Shirt untucked.

CHARLIE
Why. Are. You. Here. Little.
Brother. Shouldn’t you be
interviewing for Second Best School
today?

A beat. Daniel stares at Charlie, disgusted.

DANIEL
Why are you such an asshole?
Seriously. What’d I ever do to you?

CHARLIE
Is that what you came back for? To
whine about me being mean to you?

DANIEL
So you don’t have an answer? That’s
just the way you’re made?

CHARLIE
That’s right. I’m stronger. And
smarter. And better than you.
71.

Daniel glares at his brother, anger building.

DANIEL
If you’re so smart, what are you
doing back here, Charlie? Big fish,
small pond syndrome? Were you just
a tiny douchebag fish at BU?

Charlie clenches his fists. He gets right in Daniel’s face.

CHARLIE
You want to know why I don’t like
you? Because you’re just like them.
You and your mandu and perfect
Korean. We’re not even from the
goddamned country!

DANIEL
Wait. You’re mad because I like
dumplings and I speak Korean?
That’s your beef?

Charlie steps closer, gets in his face.

CHARLIE
No, my problem is you don’t have a
spine. You’ve always done what
they’ve told you to. You’re their
little golden boy. It’s pathetic.

DANIEL
Wow. I’m not even angry at you
anymore. I just feel sorry for you.

Charlie sees the pity in Daniel’s face. He grabs Daniel by
the collar.

CHARLIE
Fuck you. You think anybody’s gonna
care about that shit at Yale?
(then, smirking)
What? You think you’re cool now
because you brought some black girl
in here--

Daniel PUNCHES Charlie in the eye socket, then recoils from
the pain in his hand. Charlie stumbles back.

Charlie’s face turns from pain to surprise to rage. He
punches Daniel in the stomach, then keeps coming. Daniel
tries to block his face, but it’s no use. Charlie’s fist
splits Daniel’s lip.
72.

He rears back, ready to deliver another blow, but Daniel
blocks his face and knees Charlie in the groin. Hard. Charlie
falls to the ground in agony. Their dad runs over.

DAE
(in Korean)
What’s going on here?

Their father eyes Daniel’s disheveled clothes and busted lip.

DAE (CONT'D)
Get some ice for your lip.

He turns to Charlie.

DAE (CONT'D)
You hit your little brother? That's
what you learn from America? To hit
your family?

Daniel gets up and goes to the--
INT. BLACK HAIR CARE STORE - BACK ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Grabs a coke and presses it against his lip. He sits on the
floor with his back against the door, breathing heavy. Looks
to a mirror on the wall.

A KNOCK on the door.

DAE (CONT'D)
Daniel, come out here now.

Daniel puts the can back in the fridge and tucks his shirt
in. He opens the door. His father is right there.

DAE (CONT'D)
I don’t care what your brother
says. The only thing that matters
is you go to school, you become a
doctor, you be successful. You find
a nice girl and have children and
you have the American Dream. You
don’t throw your future away for
temporary things you only want
right now.

DANIEL
But Appa, what if I don’t want the
same things you want?

His father holds up his hand, silencing him.
73.

DAE
Doesn’t matter what you want. If
you don’t go to Yale and become a
doctor, then you’re on your own.

A standoff. They hold eye contact. Neither budging.

Finally Daniel grabs his crumpled suit jacket, throws it on
and marches out the door. Busted lip and all.

INT. JEREMY FITZGERALD'S OFFICE - DAY
Hannah greets Tasha as she enters.

HANNAH
Perfect timing, Miss Kingsley.
Follow me, please.

Hannah leads Tasha into the back office, knocks lightly on
the door. JEREMY FITZGERALD, 50s, opens the door, a small
bandage above his eyebrow and another around his wrist.

HANNAH (CONT'D)
Jeremy, Tasha Kingsley.

FITZGERALD
Come on in.

Jeremy smiles warmly at Tasha. Tasha enters hesitantly.

FITZGERALD (CONT'D)
(to Tasha)
Sit, sit, sit, sit. Sorry for the
delay. I reviewed your file.
Please, tell me how this all came
to pass.

NATASHA
I’m not sure where to begin...

Fitzgerald leans in.
NATASHA (V.O.)
+..So I start with the night my
father ruined our lives.
INT. NATASHA’S APARTMENT - FLASHBACK - NIGHT
Tasha, Peter and Mrs. Kingsley sit around the small kitchen

table as Mr. Kingsley clears the Chinese take out and pulls
an envelope out of his pocket.
74.

MR. KINGSLEY
My family. Please do me the very
great honor of coming to see me
perform the role of Walter Lee
Younger in the Village Troupe’s
production of “A Raisin in the
Sun.”

He pulls out three tickets and proudly hands them out. But
Mrs. Kingsley doesn’t take hers.

MRS. KINGSLEY
You and your foolishness. You can
keep your ticket. I’m not going
anywhere.

Mrs. Kingsley storms out. A beat later a DOOR SLAMS down the
hall. Peter slumps in his chair.

MR. KINGSLEY
Don’t worry ‘bout your mother. She
don’t mean it, man.

NATASHA (V.O.)
But she did mean it. She didn’t go
with us. Said it was a waste of her
hard-earned money.

INT. OFF BROADWAY THEATER - FLASHBACK - NIGHT

Tasha and Peter sit front row with an empty seat between
them. Stare up at the stage.

NATASHA (V.O.)
I want to be able to say that my
father was not good. That his
talents were only mediocre.
Mediocre would explain all the
years of rejection...

ON STAGE Mr. Kingsley gives a command performance. The
audience, including his children, are entranced.

NATASHA (V.O.)
But he was excellent. Transcendent.
He belonged on that stage more than
he’s ever belonged with us.

LATER - The actors bow, with Mr. Kingsley center stage,
soaking it all in.
75.

NATASHA (V.O.)
I’ve never seen him happier. And
I’m certain he will never be that
happy again.
LATER STILL - Mr. Kingsley stands center stage, staring off
into the empty theater - save for Tasha and Peter. Peter
breaks his father’s trance.

PETER
You ready, Pops?

Mr. Kingsley looks down at them with far-away eyes.
MR. KINGSLEY

You children go on ahead. I’1l see
you later.

INT. BAR - FLASHBACK - LATER THAT NIGHT

 

Mr. Kingsley drinks with his cast mates. They down shot after
shot, enjoying the evening.

NATASHA (V.O.)
So instead of coming with us, he
went out drinking with his “fellow
actors.”

Mr. Kingsley finally downs his last drink and stumbles toward
the exit.

EXT. STREET - FLASHBACK - NIGHT

QUICK CUTS: Mr. Kingsley drives down the street recklessly. A
POLICE CAR turns the sirens on and pulls behind him.

On Mr. Kingsley’s face. Shit. He knows he messed up.

NATASHA (V.O.)
And though he only had three beers,
those three beers were enough to
change everything.

The POLICE OFFICER approaches the window and asks for license
and registration.

NATASHA (V.O.)
In all the time he’d been here,
he'd never had one run in with the
law. But here he was, face to face
with cops, without the proper
paperwork to show.
76.

INT. FITZGERALD'S OFFICE - PRESENT
Fitzgerald’s still listening. Now puzzled.

FITZGERALD
Can’t believe he’d get behind the
wheel like that with so much at
stake.

NATASHA
I don’t think he was thinking about
anything but how happy... how free
he was in that moment.

On Tasha’s face. There’s more to it than she’s saying.

NATASHA (V.O.)
That was part of it, but not the
whole story...

INT. NATASHA’S APARTMENT - FLASHBACK - NIGHT

Tasha leans her ear against the door of her parents’ bedroom.
INSIDE Mr. and Mrs. Kingsley argue.

MRS. KINGSLEY
When we met you said all my dreams
would come true. You remember that,
Kingsley? You’re a good actor
because you make me believe all the
pretty things you say.

MR. KINGSLEY
I’m tired of your dreams. What
‘bout mine? If it wasn’t for you
and the children, my life would be
better. If it wasn’t for you and
the children I would have all the
things I want. I’d be doing the
thing God put me on this earth to
do.

IN THE HALLWAY - Tasha slumps down as her father’s words hit
her heart.

NATASHA (V.O.)
But I don’t tell Fitzgerald that
part-- that we are my father’s
greatest regret because we got in
the way of his dreams.
77.

INT. FITZGERALD'S OFFICE - PRESENT
Fitzgerald sits silent, hands steepled as he thinks.

NATASHA (V.O.)
I wonder how many stories like mine
has Fitzgerald’s heard over the
years. How many hopeless cases he’s
had to sit through...

Fitzgerald looks over one of the forms then gets a yellow
legal pad out of his desk drawer, then jots something down.

Then he sits in silence for a long beat. His expression very
hard to read. Tasha stares at him, nervously.

NATASHA (V.O.)
Each moment of silence is soul
crushing. I knew I shouldn’t have
listened to Hannah. Shouldn’t have
gotten my hopes up...

Then finally--

FITZGERALD
Miss Kingsley--

NATASHA
It’s okay. I know I’m out of
options. Thank you for your time.

Tasha moves to get up. But Fitzgerald waves her back down.

FITZGERALD
You’re never out of options.

NATASHA
What do you mean? Are you saying
you can fix this?

FITZGERALD

I’m going to go see a judge friend
of mine. He’ll be able to get the
Voluntary Removal reversed so at
least you don’t have to leave
tomorrow. After that we can file an
appeal with the BIA-the Board of
Immigration Appeals...

(checks his watch)
Give me a couple of hours. I can
make this happen. Just need to get
the judge to file by six o'clock.

Tasha’s taken aback.
78.

FITZGERALD (CONT'D)
I‘1l call you when it’s all sorted
out.

NATASHA
But you think you can sort it out?

FITZGERALD
Yes. I’ve done it many, many times
before. You'll be fine.

He smiles at her confidently. Tasha’s eyes light up. She
throws her arms around him in a big, impromptu bear hug.

NATASHA
Thank you. You have no idea how
much this means to me. My family.

NATASHA (V.O.)
I should call my parents and tell
them, but right now, all I can
think about is Daniel.

INT. DINER - DAY

Daniel sits at an empty booth. Omar sees him and walks over,
looks him up and down.

OMAR
Dude, what the hell happened to
you? Did you get robbed?

DANIEL
What?
(then realizing)
I got into a fight. With Charlie.

OMAR
Oooh! Finally! That dick’s had it
coming for a good ten years...
(a beat)
How'd your interview go?

DANIEL
Postponed it. For Tasha.

OMAR
Are you insane?

DANIEL
Yes. Probably. But then we got into
it and now I’ve lost her, too--
79.

Omar sits down across from Daniel.

OMAR
You’re such a drama queen. It’s
just a girl, man. There’s other
girls.

DANIEL
No. Not like her. I didn’t even get
her number.

OMAR
So Facebook her.

DANIEL
I don’t know her last name.

OMAR
So? If it’s in the stars, nothing
can stop it. Even your clumsy, no-
game-having ass, can’t fuck up this
good thing if it really was sent
down from Zeus or whoever.

DANIEL
Am I supposed to sit here and wait
for her to walk in the door?
OMAR
No, but you can retrace your steps.
Or, better yet, Do you know where
she might be headed?
Daniel thinks. Then jumps up from the booth and runs out.
INT. 52ND STREET SUBWAY - DAY

Tasha walks down the platform and onto the UPTOWN train.

INT. 52ND STREET SUBWAY - DAY

Daniel sprints down the platform, barely making it onto the
DOWNTOWN train as the door closes.

We pull out to REVEAL Tasha and Daniel are in the same place
heading in opposite directions.

Natasha’s on the UPTOWN TRAIN, back to the platform. Daniel's
on the DOWNTOWN TRAIN facing it.

The trains start moving in opposite directions.
80.

INT. BLACK HAIR CARE STORE - DAY

The bell on the door CHIMES with happy optimism as Tasha
steps in. Looks behind the counter and sees Charlie on his
phone. He barely looks up as Tasha approaches the counter.

NATASHA
Hey.

Charlie finishes with his text and finally looks up. His eye
is red and swollen.

NATASHA (CONT’D)
Wow! That thing’s gonna be black
and blue by morning.

Charlie raises his hand and touches his eye self-consciously.
His knuckles are bruised too.

CHARLIE
Daniel’s not here.

NATASHA
I know. I was hoping you could help
me find him. Do you have his cell
phone number?

Charlie leans back in his chair.

CHARLIE
You two get into a fight?

NATASHA
Do you have it or not?

He flips his phone end over end.

CHARLIE
What’s your deal? You got a Korean
boy fetish or something?

NATASHA
Charlie. Please. I have something
important I need to tell him.

CHARLIE
Tell me why I should.

Tasha thinks...

NATASHA
Well, think about how much trouble
I’ll cause for your brother. He’s

in love with me.
(MORE )
81.

NATASHA (CONT'D)
You give me his number, he chases
after me and you can just sit back
and enjoy the show while your
parents freak out on him. It’s like
you said-- it’1l take all the heat
off you.

Charlie throws his head back and laughs.

CHARLIE
That's a pretty decent pitch.

Charlie takes a beat, considers this. Then he pulls up the
number and shows it to a surprised Tasha.

EXT. NEW YORK STREET/EXT. HARLEM STREET - MINUTES LATER
INTERCUT AS NECESSARY:

Daniel stares down at a number he doesn’t recognize on his
phone. Answers it anyway.

DANIEL
Hello?

NATASHA
Is this Daniel?

DANIEL
Natasha?

NATASHA

Yes, it’s me. Your brother gave me
your number.

DANIEL
Charlie? Yeah, right. Who is this?

NATASHA
Daniel, it’s me. It’s really me.

Daniel stands up, moving away from Omar.

DANIEL
Why are you calling me?

NATASHA
Just give me a chance to explain.

Daniel is still hurt from their fight.
82.

DANIEL
Are you sure I’m not a not a waste
of time?

NATASHA

Come on, Daniel. It’s complicated.
Meet me somewhere. Please?

Off Daniel’s look, he’s softening.

EXT. 2ND AVE - MANHATTAN - DAY

Montage of Natasha and Daniel walking and talking through the
city. Natasha is explaining her deportation situation to
Daniel. Quickly cut, this scene is set to a bittersweet
musical theme. Daniel digests her story.

DANIEL
And I thought my home life was
complicated. What’s the good news
again?

NATASHA
Oh, a new lawyer thinks he can get
the order reversed...

DANIEL
Does that mean--

NATASHA
I might not have to leave tomorrow.

DANIEL
(beaming)
What? Seriously? No way!
Daniel LIFTS Tasha off her feet and SPINS her around.
NATASHA
He wasn’t a hundred-percent sure,
but there’s a chance.

DANIEL
I can’t believe it.

Daniel holds Tasha. Their eyes meet. Daniel tilts forward.
Before he can kiss her, she pulls away with excitement.

NATASHA
I got an idea.

She takes his hand and leads him towards...
83.

EXT. ROOSEVELT ISLAND TRAM STATION - MANHATTAN - DAY

The little Roosevelt Island tram car glides over the East
River and into the station. Natasha and Daniel buy tickets.

INT. ROOSEVELT ISLAND TRAM - DUSK

The tram is empty but for Daniel and Tasha. All of New York
is in view. A breathtaking panorama.

DANIEL
Last time I was on this thing was
in second grade. And there was an
old guy who smelled like tuna fish.

NATASHA
I hate tuna fish.

DANIEL
Right? Now I’ve got an idea.

Daniel scrolls a playlist on his phone and presses PLAY. We
hear PURPLE RAIN by Prince:

Tasha smiles. He’s cute. His striking looks illuminated by
the setting sun. She looks awkwardly at the floor, then out
the window, laughs. He takes her hand, pulls her close.

They dance slowly in the middle of the sky. The MUSIC PLAYS
as We SWEEP around the car, all of New York City glimmering
around them.

NATASHA
Is it gonna hurt if I kiss you?

DANIEL
It'll be a good pain.

She pulls him in. Then, a kiss like no other. Sparks fly.
Tasha opens her eyes. She pulls back.

NATASHA
All our kisses aren’t going to be
like that are they?

DANIEL
Like what?

NATASHA
You know. Insane.

Daniel smiles.
84.

DANIEL
I don’t know... maybe we should try
it again and see.

They kiss again, holding one another as the music continues
to play. The entire city lit up at night. Lights twinkling in
the surrounding skyscrapers, like stars in the sky.

EXT. ROOSEVELT ISLAND - DOCK - NIGHT

Manhattan glows across the East River. Tasha rests on
Daniel’s chest, wrapped in his arms.

DANIEL
It's getting late. Are your parents
going to be worried about you?

NATASHA
They're okay...told them I was with
Bev tonight. What about your
parents?

DANIEL
I’1l deal with them later.
Tonight’s about us.

NATASHA
In that case...got any more of
those questions for me?

DANIEL
You’re not in love with me yet?
NATASHA
(smiles)
Nope.
DANIEL

Don’t worry. We’ve got time now.
Tasha nuzzles further into Daniel’s warm body.
DANIEL (CONT'D)
How about the dinner guest
question?

NATASHA
You mean who I'd invite?

DANIEL
Yup.
85.

NATASHA
Easy. Carl Sagan.

DANIEL
Who?

NATASHA

You'd like him...a scientist anda
writer. It was almost romantic how
much he loved the universe.

(then)
People think science is so cold,
but it isn’t true. It actually
makes you appreciate your life.

DANIEL
Meaning...

Tasha smiles, shifts her gaze upward to the heavens.

NATASHA
Think about it...the universe is
99.99999% empty space. Nothing but
rocks and burning stars spread out
over a billion galaxies--and yet
here we are, the two of us
together, looking out at the
universe. We won the cosmic lottery
just by being born...the time we
have on this earth is
extraordinary. It’s up to us to
make the most of it.

Daniel is speechless. Charmed by her words. They lock eyes.
DANIEL
I want to make the most of
everything...with you.
Daniel’s instincts take over. He kisses her.
A SHOOTING STAR begins a TIMELAPSE of the night sky, ending
as the sun rises above the New York skyline.

EXT. ROOSEVELT ISLAND - DOCK - DAY

Tasha’s already up, watching the sunrise. Daniel’s ALARM goes
off, waking him. Tasha greets him with a kiss.

TASHA
Good morning.
86.

DANIEL
I could get used to waking up like
this. How long have you been up?

TASHA
I wanted to see the sunrise. It’s a
perfect morning.

Daniel joins her. They look out to the city together. A beat.
Then, a hint of dread on Daniel’s face.

DANIEL
I'd better go. My interview’s in an
hour.

TASHA

I’m coming with you.

EXT. FITZGERALD'S BUILDING - MORNING
Daniel hesitates at the entryway before going inside.

TASHA
Wait? What are we doing here?

DANIEL
My interview’s in the same building
as your appointment. Looks like
we've traded places.

TASHA
Really? What are the odds?

DANIEL
I keep telling you--

TASHA
Don’t say it.

DANIEL
I won't rub it in this time. Will
you wait for me?

Of course she will. Tasha steps closer, straightens his tie
for him. Daniel dusts off his pants.

DANIEL (CONT'D)
How do I look?

NATASHA
Like a poet in a suit.

Tasha pecks him on the cheek.
87.

NATASHA (CONT’D)
You got this!

Daniel takes a deep breath and heads in. Natasha hangs back.

INT. FITZGERALD'S BUILDING - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Daniel taps on the door. Silence. He tries the handle.
Locked.

Daniel SIGHS. Almost relieved. Then...

FITZGERALD (0.S.)
Daniel Bae.

Daniel presses his ear to the door. Checks the handle again.
DANIEL
(into the door)
Hello?

FITZGERALD (0.S.)
Behind you.

PULL BACK to REVEAL Fitzgerald, watching Daniel talking to
the door. Daniel looks back and straightens up.

DANIEL
Oh--Umm... Hi.
FITZGERALD
Jeremy Fitzgerald.
DANIEL
Mr. Fitzgerald. It’s nice to meet

you.
Fitzgerald unlocks the door and opens it wide.

DANIEL (CONT'D)
Sorry...I thought--

FITZGERALD
No, I’m late. Come in and have a
seat.

INT. JEREMY FITZGERALD'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
Fitzgerald looks over Daniel’s application as he moves to his

desk. Daniel sits and sees a file on the desk. “Natasha
Kingsley.” Daniel stares, shocked.
88.

DANIEL
(interrupting)
Are you an immigration lawyer?

FITZGERALD
I am. Why?

DANIEL
I think I know one of your clients.

Daniel picks up Tasha’s file and Fitzgerald immediately
snatches it back.

FITZGERALD
Don’t touch that. It’s privileged.

He pulls it as far away from Daniel as possible.

DANIEL
Sorry. You...you saved my life.

FITZGERALD
What are you talking about?

DANIEL
I met her-- Natasha-- yesterday.
Just a handful of hours ago she
said she was being deported, but
then she met with you and you did
your lawyer magic, and now she’s
going to stay.

FITZGERALD
And how did that save your life?
DANIEL
She’s The One.
FITZGERALD
Didn't you say you just met her
yesterday?
DANIEL
Yup.
FITZGERALD

And you know she’s the one?
Fitzgerald stares at Daniel skeptically.

FITZGERALD (CONT'D)
Why are you here?
89.

DANIEL
Um, I’m here for my admission
interview?

FITZGERALD
No, really. Why are you here? You
obviously don’t care about this
interview. You postponed it and now
you show up here in wrinkled
clothes, looking like you’ve been
in a brawl. It’s a serious
question. Why did you come here?

Daniel takes a deep breath.

DANIEL
Honestly? My parents made me. So I
guess I have to be here.

FITZGERALD
No, you don’t. You can just get up
and walk out that door.

DANIEL
I owe it to my parents.
FITZGERALD
Why?
DANIEL
(sighs)

My parents are immigrants. They
work all the time so my brother and
I can have the American Dream.
Nowhere in the American Dream does
it say you can skip college and
become a starving artist.

FITZGERALD
It says whatever you want it to.

DANIEL
Not in my family it doesn’t. If I
don’t do this, I get cut off. No
funds for college. No nothing.

FITZGERALD
Would they really do that?

Daniel FLASHES BACK to the image of HIS FATHER’S FACE as he
gives Daniel the ultimatum.

DANIEL
Yes. He would.
FITZGERALD
So I guess you have to be sure this
artist life is worth it.

DANIEL
Haven't you ever done something
only because you’re obligated to?
Just because you made a promise?

Fitzgerald’s eyes drift away.

FITZGERALD
Meeting your obligations is the
definition of adulthood, kid. And
today, I have to make a call that I
didn’t want to have to make.

He pulls out Natasha’s file.

FITZGERALD (CONT'D)
I couldn’t do it.

DANIEL
Do what?

FITZGERALD
Stop her deportation.
(off Daniel’s look)
Your Natasha...she’s going to be
deported today. I’m sorry, kid.

Daniel stares down at the file, incredulous.

FITZGERALD (CONT'D)
I tried everything--

DANIEL
You didn’t try hard enough.

FITZGERALD
Listen, I know you’re upset.

DANIEL
It’s not her fault her dad messed
up. She’s been here all of her
life. America is her home!

FITZGERALD
I wish there was something I could
do. I’m planning on calling her
after you and I are done here.
91.

DANIEL
You’re just going to call her and
tell her over the phone?

FITZGERALD
Does it matter how she hears it?

DANIEL
Of course it matters. I don’t want
her to have her heart broken by
someone she barely knows.

Daniel walks out, into the empty reception area. Fitzgerald
follows.

FITZGERALD
So that’s it? No more interview?

DANIEL
You said it yourself. I don’t
really care about Yale.

FITZGERALD
Look, Daniel, Yale’s a big deal.
Going there could open a lot of
doors for you. It did for me.

DANIEL
And you're still not happy.

FITZGERALD

What’s another half an hour to
finish this interview?

DANIEL
Time counts, Mr. Fitzgerald... But
you know that already.

Daniel storms off in search of Natasha.

EXT. FITZGERALD'S OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

Daniel walks through the sliding glass doors. His face is
grim. Tasha takes notice.

NATASHA
What happened?

A beat.

DANIEL
I really love you.
92.

NATASHA
Daniel, what’s wrong?

DANIEL
You don’t have to say it back, but
I really do. I just want you to
know it.
Tasha’s phone rings. It’s Fitzgerald's office.

DANIEL (CONT'D)
Don’t answer it.

NATASHA
I have to--

DANIEL
Please don’t.

His tone alarms her. Tasha lets it go to voicemail.

NATASHA

What happened in there?
DANIEL

You can’t stay here...

(beat, then)

My interviewer was your lawyer.
NATASHA

Fitzgerald?

Daniel nods.

NATASHA (CONT’D)
What did he say?

DANIEL
He couldn’t get the order
overturned.

NATASHA
But he said he could do it!

Daniel’s squeezes her hand and tries to pull her in, but
Tasha pushes him away.

NATASHA (CONT’D)
Are you sure? Why were you even
talking about me?

DANIEL
Your file was on his desk.
93.

He grabs her hand again. Tasha pulls it back forcefully.

NATASHA
Stop. Just stop!

DANIEL
I’m sorry.

NATASHA

Just tell me what he said. Exactly.

DANIEL
He said the deportation order
stands. You and your family have to
leave. Today.

Tasha sits on the edge of the fountain. Daniel joins her.

DANIEL (CONT'D)
What are we going to do?

NATASHA
I should go home. Flight’s this
afternoon.

DANIEL

I‘1l go with you.
(off her look)
I mean to your house.

NATASHA
I don’t think that’s a good idea.
My parents are there and I have too
much to do. You’1ll just get in the
way.

He stands up and holds out his hand for hers.

DANIEL

Here’s what we’re not going to do.
We are not going to argue. We are
not going to pretend that this
isn’t the worst thing on earth,
because it is. I’m going with you
to your parents’ house. I’m going
to look at the place where you
sleep and eat and live and wish
that I’d known just a little sooner
that you were right here.

(beat, then)
Is that okay with you?

Tasha nods yes. They start walking toward the subway station.
33

94,

INT. NATASHA’S BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY
Daniel fidgets with his suit. Tasha feigns a smile.
DANIEL
Should I take my jacket off? I feel
like an idiot.

NATASHA
You don’t have to be nervous.

DANIEL
I’m going to meet your parents.
Now’s as good a time to be nervous
as any.
He unbuttons the jacket but doesn’t take it off.
NATASHA
The good thing is, you can screw up

all you want. You’ll probably never
see them again.

INT. NATASHA’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 33

Tasha cautiously steps in, followed by Daniel. Peter packs
suitcases as he sways to loud dancehall music.

MRS. KINGSLEY
Turn that music off.

Peter does just that as Tasha’s Mom sees her.
MRS. KINGSLEY (CONT'D)
Lawd, ‘Tasha. I been calling and
calling you for--

Mrs. Kingsley notices Daniel and pauses.

MRS. KINGSLEY (CONT’D)
Who's this?

NATASHA
This is Daniel.

Mrs. Kingsley zeroes in. Examines Daniel more closely.
DANIEL
Sorry to meet you under these
circumstances, Mrs. Kingsley.

Daniel shakes Mrs. Kingsley’s hand, then Peter greets him.
95.

PETER
(smiling wide)
‘Tasha’s never brought a boy here
before.

Mrs. Kingsley waves Tasha to the side.

MRS. KINGSLEY
‘Tasha, I need to talk to you.

NATASHA
Is it about Daniel? Because if it
is, we can just do it right here.
He’s my boyfriend.

Mr. Kingsley walks in as the words leave Tasha’s lips.

MR. KINGSLEY
Since when do you have a boyfriend?
That's what you been doing all day
and night instead of helping your
family pack up?

NATASHA
No. What I was doing was trying to
fix your mistakes.

MR. KINGSLEY
It don't look nothing like that to
me.
(turns to Daniel)
You know the situation?

Daniel nods.

MR. KINGSLEY (CONT’D)
Then you know that now’s not the
time for strangers to be here.

NATASHA
He’s not a stranger. He’s my guest.

MR. KINGSLEY
And this is my house--

NATASHA
Was your house. You weren’t
responsible enough of a father to
keep it, remember? Or maybe you
couldn’t handle the responsibility
of being a father at all...

MR. KINGSLEY
What’s that supposed to mean?
96.

NATASHA
I heard what you told mom after the

play--

MRS. KINGSLEY
Baby. There’s no point in rehashing
all this now.

MR. KINGSLEY
No, man. No, man. I want hear what
she has to say to me.
Just as father and daughter square off. Daniel interjects.

DANIEL
Tasha, you don’t have to--

Mr. Kingsley pushes Daniel back.

MR. KINGSLEY
Say what you have to say, Tasha!

Tasha looks at Daniel, she wants to do this. She steps up to
her father.

NATASHA
I heard what you said about me and
Peter... That we were your greatest

regrets. How could you say that
about your own children?

The steam comes out of Mr. Kingsley’s engine. He searches
futilely for words...

NATASHA (CONT’D)
I’m sorry that life didn’t give you
all the things you wanted.

MR. KINGSLEY
I didn’t mean it ‘Tasha. It was
just talk. All of it was just--

She holds up her hand to stop him. Tears pool in Mr.
Kingsley’s eyes.

NATASHA
Maybe you were right. Maybe you
weren’t meant to have us. Maybe you
really were cheated.

MR. KINGSLEY
(shaking his head)
Was just talk ‘Tasha. I really
didn’t mean nothing by it.
97.

NATASHA
It doesn’t matter if you meant it
or not. Hearing you say those words
spoiled all the good memories I did
have of us. Made me wonder, did you
regret my existence when we were
watching cricket matches together?
Eating mint chocolate chip ice
cream after school? What about the
day I was born?

Tears stream from Natasha’s face. Daniel holds her. She pulls
free from him, continuing.

NATASHA (CONT’D)
But I decided, you don’t get to
regret us. People make mistakes all
the time. Small ones, like getting
in the wrong checkout line. And big
ones like giving up... I saw the
play. That night, on stage you were
incredible. But in real life, all
you’ve done is quit on your family.
Leaving the rest of us to pick up
where you left off.

Mrs. Kingsley’s crying now too. Peter walks into her arms for
a hug.

MR. KINGSLEY
‘Tasha, I’m sorry. You should have
never heard those words from my
mouth. When we came here, it was
supposed to be different... but
America has never been what they
said it was gonna be for me. I
can’t stand seeing your mother work
her fingers to the bone day in and
day out anymore than I can stand
the holes in your brother's
sneakers. We’re immigrants, Tasha.
How can I be a man when the rest of
the world says that I am not?

Tasha wipes her brother’s face. Comforts him. Replies.

NATASHA
You decide who you are, that’s how.
That’s why we came here, not for
handouts, but to make our own
lives.

Mr. Kingsley holds his head in his hands. Ashamed. Tasha
approaches, gently laying a hand on his shoulder.
34

98.

NATASHA (CONT’D)

Dad, I know what it cost you to
bring us here. But just because it
got hard, doesn’t mean we don’t
still need you. When we get to
Jamaica, you can’t give up. You can
be a father. A husband. And an
actor all at once. It’s up to you.

She hugs him. Mrs. Kingsley and Peter join in.

NATASHA (V.O.)
It wasn't exactly the ending I was
hoping for this morning, but at
least we were on our way to being a
family again.

Tasha sniffs, then motions for Daniel. Together as one, they
embrace.

EXT./INT. CAB - DAY 34

Peter looks out from the back of a cab as it drives off with

Tasha’s family. On the curb, a CABBIE loads Tasha’s suitcase

into the trunk of another cab. Tasha finishes a FACETIME with
Bev as Daniel climbs into the backseat.

BEV (ON THE PHONE)
I’m booking my flight now!
Christmas in Jamaica is a thing,

right?
NATASHA (ON THE PHONE)
(laughs)
Yes, I believe so.
(beat)
I’m so sorry, Bev. It all happened
so fast.

The cabbie gets inside the car.
NATASHA (CONT’D)
I have to go. I’1l call you soon as
I land. Love you.

Tasha hangs up, then gets in the cab.

INT. CAB - DAY

Natasha looks out the window, soaking up her Bronx
neighborhood one final time. Then she lays her head on
Daniel’s shoulder.
99.

NATASHA
Do you think we would've worked out
if I stayed?

DANIEL
No question. Do you?

NATASHA
Yes.

Daniel smiles.

NATASHA (CONT’D)
How hard would it have been for
your parents?

DANIEL
It would take them a long time.
Longer for my dad. I don’t think
they’d have come to our wedding.

NATASHA
I have something to tell you.

DANIEL
What’s that?

NATASHA
You shouldn’t go to Yale and be a
doctor if your heart’s not in it.
If you want to be a poet and write
your heart out, do that. There’s
still time.

DANIEL
What about doing the practical
thing?

NATASHA
Practicality is overrated.

DANIEL
Does that mean you don’t want to be
a data scientist anymore?

NATASHA
I don’t know. Maybe not. You got me
thinking. It’d be nice to do
something I’m actually passionate
about, like study the stars.

Daniel turns to her, surprised.
100.

DANIEL
What a difference a day makes.

They're silent for a long beat.

NATASHA
So, how many more questions do we
have left?

He takes out his phone.

He laughs.

DANIEL
Just one. And we still have to
stare into each other’s eyes for
four minutes.

NATASHA
We could do that or...we could just
make out instead.

CABBIE
You guys know I can hear you,
right?
(through the rearview
mirror)
I can see you too.

Tasha and Daniel join in.

DANIEL
Okay, last question. Of all the
people in your family, whose death
would you find the most disturbing,

and why?

NATASHA
My dad.

DANIEL
Why him?

NATASHA

Because he’s not done yet. What
about you?

DANIEL
Yours.

NATASHA
I’m not your family, though.
101.

DANIEL
Yes, you are. In some other
universe maybe we're married, with
two kids, or maybe two cats.

NATASHA
You always find the right words.
(beat)
You’1ll make a great poet.

Daniel takes this in. The cab pulls to the curb.

EXT. AIRPORT - DAY

Tasha and Daniel stand at the curb, trying their best to keep
it together. Prince’s “I Would Die For You” starts playing on
the radio inside the cab.

DANIEL
You hear that?

Tasha cracks a somber smile.

DANIEL (CONT'D)
Three times in one day...what are
the odds?

Daniel winks. Tasha softens.

DANIEL (CONT'D)
So...are you ready for the finale?

Daniel sets his phone timer for FOUR MINUTES then takes both
Natasha’s hands in his.

DANIEL (CONT'D)
I’m not sure if we’re supposed to
hold hands during this part but --
why not.

The clock runs. They stare into each other’s eyes, giggling a
little at first. Tasha looks away but Daniel squeezes her
hands just enough to get her to focus. As she stares in his
eyes...

NATASHA (V.O.)
Daniel believes this is fate...
that everything aligned for us to
be in the right place at just the
right time. I don’t know that this

is fate.
(MORE )
102.

NATASHA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
But I do know that a lot of events
had to transpire for us to be
standing here, right now, in the
middle of this vast universe.
That’s amazing.

They continue to stare, less self-conscious. Their smiles
drift away as they catalog each other’s face. Tasha relives
all the moments that led them here:

NATASHA (V.O.)
Because if I hadn't been late to my
appointment, I wouldn’t have met
Lester Barnes. And if he hadn’t
said the word ‘irie,’ I wouldn’t
have had a meltdown. And if I
hadn’t had my meltdown, I wouldn’t
have eventually met Daniel.

As she speaks, we see GLIMPSES of the day.
NATASHA (V.O.)
And if I hadn’t met Daniel, I may
have never known this feeling
that’s taking over me right now.
This feeling that can only be--
The phone timer BUZZES, bringing Tasha BACK TO REALITY.
NATASHA
Love.
(beat, then)
I love you, Daniel Bae.

DANIEL
I guess the questionnaire worked.

Tasha’s phone RINGS. She looks down. It’s her mom.

DANIEL (CONT'D)
You have to go...

She nods. But neither one of them moves.

NATASHA
I don’t know how to say goodbye.

Daniel’s eyes mist.

DANIEL
Then don’t...

On Tasha’s face, she has to.
103.

DANIEL (CONT'D)
This day can’t be all there is. It
just can’t--

Before he can finish, Tasha pulls him into a long, final hug.
Then she reluctantly lets him go.

NATASHA
Bye, Daniel.

Tasha turns and walks off, leaving Daniel looking on,
heartbroken, as she disappears inside the airport.

INT. CAB - DAY

Daniel gets in a cab and shuts the door. Slumps in his seat.

CABBIE
Where to?

DANIEL
I don’t care. Just drive.

INT. AIRPORT - TICKET COUNTER - DAY

 

Natasha and her family check their bags.

MRS. KINGSLEY
Get out your ID's.

Tasha searches her purse, absentmindedly. Her heart still
with Daniel.

INT./EXT. AIRPORT - VARIOUS LOCATIONS - DAY

The cab approaches two paths: one to exit the airport, the

other to return to the terminals. Daniel looks back and forth
between the two paths. Then suddenly sits up.

DANIEL

Can you please circle back?
CABBIE

Did you forget something?
DANIEL

Yes, sir. Something really

important.

The cabbie takes the terminal exit and they circle back.
104.

INT. AIRPORT - CONTINUOUS

Natasha and her family enter the long TSA security line.
CLOSE ON her ticket. ONE WAY.

EXT. AIRPORT - CONTINUOUS

The taxi pulls up to Tasha’s terminal. Daniel hands the
cabbie a few bucks and then takes off running.

INT. AIRPORT - CONTINUOUS

Daniel sprints through the airport, searching for Tasha.

TICKETING AREA —- CONTINUOUS

Daniel panting heavily, hair in his face. No Tasha. He looks
up...

ON THE DEPARTURES BOARD

Countries from all over the world. He finds the flight to
Jamaica. Daniel notes the gate. DARTS off.

INT. TSA SECURITY CHECKPOINT - CONTINUOUS

Tasha and her family wait their turn in the TSA line.

ON DANIEL

Searching the crowded line for her. No Tasha. Then finally...
He spots a familiar AFRO in the crowd of people. He slows to
a brisk walk, fixes his hair, then ducks under the stretched
barriers, cutting the line.

CLOSE ON NATASHA

She’s lost in her own world, head down. Forlorn. Then...

DANIEL (0.S.)
‘Tasha!

She turns at the sound of her name.
ANGLE ON DANIEL

His eyes go WIDE...
105.

It’s TASHA! She looks on at Daniel, in disbelief.

NATASHA
What are you doing here?
DANIEL
Marry me. Then you can legally
stay.
NATASHA

Marry you? You can’t be serious.
(off his look)
You are.

DANIEL
You love me, right? Isn’t that what
you just said?

NATASHA
I do, but--

DANIEL
So we'll elope and we’1ll move
somewhere cheap... I’ll get a

crappy job and write at night...
and you can finish school and
graduate with your friends and then
become a data scientist or-- an
astronomer! You can do whatever you
want, Tasha. Just stay.

NATASHA
Daniel... listen. I do really love
you. But we have to be smart. We’ve
only known each other for a day. A
day. You keep saying we're meant to
be, but what if we’re not?

An ANNOUNCEMENT drowns her out.

GATE AGENT (V.O.)
(loudspeaker)

This is the boarding call for

flight 436 to Jamaica...

Time’s up. Tears gather in Tasha’s eyes. She takes Daniel by

the hand.

NATASHA
Right now, this is real life. The
plane waiting on the tarmac to send
me and my family back to Jamaica is

very real. I tried to stay...
(MORE )
106.

NATASHA (CONT'D)

I tried everything and I failed,
and now that’s it. I have to go.

Tasha lets a single tear fall down her face. Daniel wipes it
off. They stand face-to-face in the security line.

DANIEL
I don’t want to lose you.

NATASHA
What happens next is up to us. We
decide our fate. There’s Facetime,
emails, Skype... we'll figure it
out. We’re not going to give up,
okay?

Tasha plants a final kiss on Daniel’s cheek, then rejoins her
family in the security line. Daniel looks on, distraught.

INT. TASHA’S PLANE - DUSK

Tasha stares out the window as the sun begins to set. Her
mother pats her arm reassuringly.

MRS. KINGSLEY
It's going to be okay, Tasha.
You'll see...

Tasha manages a small smile. The plane ascends into the night
sky. Tasha looks out the window watching the city fade.

NATASHA (V.O.)

From up here, the city lights look
like earth-bound stars. And I know
one of those stars is Daniel...

INT. AIRTRAIN - DUSK

Daniel sits on a train, watches a plane take off. Is it
Tasha’s? He takes out his notebook and starts to write.

DANIEL (V.O.)
You come to me from another world.

He looks out the window as the airport fades into the
distance.

DANIEL (V.O., CONT'D)
From beyond the stars and void of
space. Transcendent. Pure. Of
unimaginable beauty.
107.

INT. TASHA’S PLANE - DUSK

Natasha looks out the window at the city below. The plane
climbs higher and higher, into the clouds.

DANIEL (V.O.)
You are the master alchemist. You
light the fire of love in earth and
sky in heart and soul.

INT. AIRTRAIN - DUSK

Daniel gazes out the window at all the buildings lit up with
people inside, in their homes.

DANIEL (V.O.)
Through your star... All opposites
unite. More than a star.

INT. TASHA’S PLANE - DUSK

Natasha's face looking out at the horizon. The glow of the
sun hits her face just as it sets.

DANIEL (V.O.)
You are my sun.

EXT. AIRTRAIN - NIGHT

Drone shot of the little train snaking through Queens at
night. The Manhattan skyline glimmers in the background.

DANIEL (V.O.)
My mom’s gonna be pissed when I get
home. And that’s fine. Because this
time next year, I’1l be someplace
else. I don’t know where, but not
here. And not Yale either. Am I
making a mistake? Maybe. But it’s
mine to make.

BEDROOM - NIGHT
SPLIT SCREEN: The two share stories of their day via SKYPE.
NATASHA (V.O.)

Over the next year, we tried hard
to make it work...
108.

INT. KINGSTON HIGH SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - DAY

Tasha’s TEACHER hands her an exam back. It’s an “A.” Her new
JAMAICAN BESTIE sees the “A” and gives Tasha a smile. In her
bag, her phone lights up. A missed call from Daniel.

NATASHA (V.O.)
But time and distance are love's
natural enemies.

EXT. HUNTER COLLEGE - DAY

Daniel sprints from the building, hops on his bike and pedals
furiously.

NATASHA (V.O.)
And the days are full.

INT. NYC RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Daniel runs in, throws on his waiter apron and gets ready for
his shift. Nods to Omar who’s taking a dish out into the
dining room. In his bag, his phone rings. A Facetime request
from Tasha that goes unanswered.

DANIEL (V.O.)
It’s not that I wanted to let her
go...I had to.

EXT. JAMAICAN TOWN - NIGHT

Tasha and her NEW FRIENDS walk through a small town, having a
good time. They’re surrounded by little stores and merchants
selling their wares. She laughs at a CUTE BOY'S joke.

DANIEL (V.O.)
It wasn't possible for her to live
in two worlds simultaneously. Heart
in one place, body in another.

INT. BOOKSTORE OPEN MIC - NIGHT

Daniel, now in his early 20's, new hair cut, still sexy,
stands at the mic, visibly nervous, reading his poem.

DANIEL
You are the master alchemist. You
light the fire of love in earth and
sky in heart and soul.
109.

NATASHA (V.O.)
I let go of Daniel to avoid being
ripped apart.

INT. ASTROPHYSICS LAB - DAY

Tasha, now in her early 20's, engages her CO-WORKERS in a
passionate discussion at work.

DANIEL (V.O.)
And as more years passed, we both
entered the adult world of
practicalities and
responsibilities...

EXT. DANIEL’S APARTMENT - DAY

Daniel reads a rejection letter from a publishing company.
He’s heartbroken.

NATASHA (V.O.)
When my mom died, I thought of
him...

INT. TASHA’S APARTMENT - DAY

Later, still wearing her black funeral dress, Tasha looks at
the norebang selfie of her and Daniel.

NATASHA (V.O.)
The magic of that day...

INT. SECOND COMING RECORD STORE - DAY

 

Daniel walks in.

DANIEL (V.O.)
+.-all the little coincidences it
took to get us to meet and fall in
love.

Daniel peruses the aisles.

DANIEL (V.O.)
Tasha often talked about the number
of events that had to go exactly
right to form our universe. She’d
said falling in love couldn’t
compete.
110.

Daniel picks up Lou Reed’s “Transformer,” smiles.

DANIEL (V.O.)
But I’ve always thought she was
wrong about that...

INT. AIRPLANE - NIGHT
CHYRON: FIVE YEARS LATER

A FEMALE FLIGHT ATTENDANT walks down the aisle checking on
passengers. In the b.g., We SEE a pair of headphones atop a
BIG CURLY AFRO that’s been dyed PINK at the ends.

DANIEL (V.O.)
Maybe our Universe was just taking
longer to form...

We MOVE IN. It’s Natasha, sitting in the aisle seat. A LITTLE
GIRL (6) colors in her book of the COSMOS next to her.

The girl meticulously details an image of a STAR with a
yellow crayon.

We HEAR Prince’s “Purple Rain” coming from Tasha’s
headphones. The Little Girl taps Natasha’s shoulder.

LITTLE GIRL
What are you listening to?

NATASHA
Just something I like to play when
I travel. Do you want to hear it?

The girl NODS. Tasha puts the headphones over her ears.
Natasha HUMS along to the music. A YOUNG MAN seated in front
of them turns around. He peers back at them, his face
obscured by the seat.

After a verse and a chorus or so, the Little Girl gives the
headphones back to Tasha.

LITTLE GIRL
It’s nice, but I prefer Beyonce.

NATASHA
(laughing)
It reminds me of someone.

The CUTEST SMILE you've ever seen from the Little Girl.
111.

LITTLE GIRL
Is it a boy?

NATASHA
Maybe...

LITTLE GIRL
Do you love him?

YOUNG MAN (0.S.)
Of course she does...

Tasha looks up. REVEAL Daniel Bae standing there, five years
older, staring her right in the face.

NATASHA
Daniel?

Natasha smiles WIDE. Daniel smiles back.

NATASHA (CONT’D)
Daniel.

Their eyes meet as both Tasha and Daniel keep beaming.
Neither believing what they’re seeing is real. But it is.
Despite the odds, this was meant to be. It was in the stars.

FADE OUT.
