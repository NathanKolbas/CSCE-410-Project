~ RABBIT ANGSTROK

John Updike, *"Rabitt, Run#
1.

Run it under a hareh green fluorescent light-

CLOSE ON AN ANGRY BLONDE PUNK, his head flying in and out of
frame. Hard against SOME GIRL's face. Banging against a
dirty mirror. Sweating. Moaning.

GIRL
Jim Jim Jimmy Jimmy Jimmy oh god
Puck me Rabbit Rabbit yes oh yes
Jimmy Rabbit Fuck Fuck Fuck

He's fucking her om top of a nasty sink. Fast. And furious.
Her short skirt hiked up high around her waist.

A wool cap pulled down tight over his face. This is Jin,
James, B, Bunny, Rabbit, B-Rabbit & Jimmy Smith Jr.

To us he's just plain JIMMY.

GIRL
Oh Rabbit fuck yes oh yes

Theytre in a desolate bathroom. Wet. Full of noise.
Beats thumping through the walls. Fists banging on the door.
The girl moan-moaning. It's all so fucking loud.

CLOSE ON JIMMY, catching sight of himself bouncing up & down
in the mirror. Ignoring the girl, he's somewhere else.
Gone. Always moving. We hear her coming. Jimmy stops.
Stares. The harsh light crowns his head, a burning halo.

He doesn't look so goad, cold sweat.

SIMMY
- I gotta run.

She jumps off the sink, yanks down her skirt.

GIRL
(pissed)
Why? You still nervous? You're
lucky I ran into you ‘cause I'm
tryin' to help calm you down. But
it’s like you ain't even fuckin'
here -

JIMMY
(pulls up his pants;
dist racted)
- What? Wasm't it good for you?

GIRL
Yeah. You know I love the way you
fuck me, Rabbit. Why do you always
gotta ask?

Before Jimmy can answer a queer look crosses his face--
He rushes for a dirty stall and
we hear him puking his fucking brains out.
2.

Jimmy, leaving the bathroom. Still a little green.

No sign of the girl. A line of guys waiting outside.

They scream, sbout. Jimmy just laughs and gives ‘em all the
finger. Heads down the corridor alone into the darkness.

a. :
An underground hip-hop club, THE SHELTER. A basement cave.
You can see the noise and the heat. Wall-to-wall kids, all
that sex. Mashing to the beat. Mostly black. Some white.
Whatever. Jinmy wipes his mouth, slips on headphones,
getting back into character. We hear his music, the song
being pumped into his head. Angry. Dsfiant. Beautiful.

He makes his way through tuc crowd, a hip-hop gladiator.
Walking tall. All attitude. Everybody around him dancing tg
a different beat. We're sampling Tony Manexo strutting down
the block from the opening of “SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER.*

Jimmy (Tony) checks out the girls, smiles their way, heading
backstage. But this ain't no fucking disco.

Before he gets far some BIG BAD DUDE stops him--

Shines a flashlight in his face. Hollas some shit at him.
Jinmy tears off his headphones. The song cuts out--

JIMMY
{yells over the music)
- Yo what the fuck you call me?

BIG BAD DUDE
Where ya goin’, dawg - you ain't
backstage, are ya?

JIMMY
What you say about me?
(gets right up in the
big man's face)
Do you even know who I am?

The big dude shines the light bright back in Jimmy's face.
He's security.

BIG BAD DUDE
Fuck no. You wanna go backstage or
what?

JIMMY
I ain't goin' nowhere ‘til you tell
me what the fuck you said, man -

Before the big guy can respond, a skinny biack superstar
pulls Jimmy away. It's THE FUTURE aka Future, Fuche & David
Porter. Also in his 20s, the FPuture‘’s all good.
FUTURE ~.
(to the Big Bad Dude)
It's all good, brotha. He's with
me -

Puture drags Jimny past the big guy backstage. Laughing at
him with love.

FUTURE
- You crazy muthafucka. Why din't
ya just tell ‘im you backstage for
the battle, Jimmy?

JIMMY
He said some shit -
{pulls away from
Future; spots
Something on his
shirt)
Fuck.

4.

Outside the club. Downtown Detroit. Bleak winter night.
Cold as hell. A mess of kids waiting to get in. Jimny
hustles up some stairs, Future right on his tail.

FUTURE
Where ya runnin' to?

JIMMY
~ I fuckin' puked on my shirt.

FUTURE
(laughs)
Pirst time's always crazy -
youknowhatImsayin'? Didn't fucking
Mary calm you down?

A needy white guy in his late 20s with a big head, *CHEDDER™
BOR ZUROWSKY aka Head, standing near the top of the line sees
Jimmy & Future heading in the opposite direction. He's siow.

CHEDDER BOB
Hey Rabbit - where ya--?

Jimmy turns, gestures *one-minute-I'll-be-right -back* and
keeps walking away. Future laughs, follows.

Chedder Bob grabs two black guys huddled against the wail
smokin' dope; a short roly-poly freak in his early 20s named
SOL GEORGE aka Mista Kingpin & Mista and his laid-back older
brother, DJ 1Z aka Israel George, Izzy & Iz, a pseudo-
intellectual with dreads and glasses.
 

They're Jimmy & Future's crew, RU486 ("Real Unforgiven For
Killin'* - also the abortion pill).

CHEDDER BOB
C'mon, Rabbit an' Future're goin"
without us -

5s.

Jimmy & Future head into a dark alley next to the club.
The crew follows. We can still hear the music booming
through the walls. A lone spotlight pierces the gloom.
dinmy stops at a dumpster near the back.

sol.
- T'night's the might, boy. You on
your way up, yo. Next stop - Deal.

DI Iz
(goes to hug Jimmy)
No doubt no doubt - S'up, brotha?

cIMMY
{pulls back)
Puked on my shirt.

Chedder Hob tries to get a closer look at Jimmy's T-shirt.

CHEDDER BOB
Lemme see -

JIMMY
(pushes him away)
Fuck off, Chedder Bob -

dimmy scrapes the dumpster away from the wall. Grabs a trash
bag hidden behind it.

SsoL
(laughs)
Now listen, Bunny - if you battle
that muthafucka Papa Doc, nigga was
talkin’ some serious shit, yo -

Jimmy opens the trash bag, starts rooting around inside.
All the guys stop and stare.

JIMMY
{pulls out some clean
clothes from the bag}
Fuckin! Janeane an' I jus' broke up
ant shit, ant she took the house an*
the goddam car -
FUTURE
- Again?

bo IZ
Maybe it's ‘cause you keep fuckin'
all those other girls for a minute -

sol.
Yeah, Rabbit -

CHEDDER BOB
No you just need to forget that -
Janeane bitch, Rabbit. Just think
about all the fine bitches you gonna
get t'night after you win -

JIMMY
(looking through
the garbage hag}
She says she's pregnant, whatever,
yo -

A long beat.

PUTURE
- Now that's the heaviest influence
in that movie right there, man.

CHEDDER BOB
I bet that bitch is lyin', Rabbit.

sol
(to Chedder Bob)
Lemme ask you a question, bitch ~
I bet you probly never even bust in
a bitch befoe. Have you?

 

CHEDDER BOR
{turns red; to Jimmy)
You gonna stay at your mom's?

JIMMY
- fuck, Bob.
(pulls out a clean
T-shirt from the bag}
Yo can I please get some privacy
here, please -

The three guys acquiesce, walk toward the lit mouth of the
alley. The Future stays.

JIMMY

(laughs)

- wy lucky shirt.
(more)
 

JIMMY (cont 'd)

(peels off the dirty

shirt; shivering in

the cold)
It's my birthday in a couple weeks,
Fuche ~ An' it's like, I gotta do
sowethin', ya know? Somethin' real.

{puts on the clean T}
~ I mean all I ever wanted to do was
rap, yo - be an emcee. But I know
they ain't gonna like me in there -

FUTURE
If you rap, you rap muthafucka. It
don't matter. You just gotta stop
givin' a fuck what cther people

dimmy hides the garbage bag back behind the dumpster.

oIMMY

- People can't talk shit about me
like that, yo.

PUTURE
Just wreck those mics ant gain some

SIMMY
It's like do or die time for me now,
Fuche.
FUTURE
{laughs}

I know whatchya sayin’ - I'm tryin'
to get straight with the Lord these
days.

They both head back up the alley toward their friends and the
Light.

JIMMY
Are you high?

FUTURE
You're B-Rabbit, yo.
you thoroughly.

(jumps; shouts out}

B-RABBIT, yo - youknowhat Imsayin'?
B-RABBIT! B-RABBIT!

They meet up with the rest of the crew. And they all shout
out, jumping, laughing, barking, "B-RABBIT! B-RABRIT! B--

SLAM TO:

CLOSE ON A FREESTYLE BATTLE,
Spotlights glare. DJ spins.

up on stage in the club.
Two emcees squaring off.

One-on-one. Two 66 second scoreboard clocks tick down...
It's Fight Music. And right now ome very short brother named
LIL* TIC (Little Lunatic) is battling Jimmy. Up in his face.

He's spittin" about--
i. Jimmy's name ~ B-Rabbit.

2. Jimmy's skin color - White.
3. Jimmy's inexperience - lst battle.

Jimmy just stands there, his wool cap pulled down tight.

Bouncing a little to the beat.

Shaking out the nerves.

Lil' Tic's killin' him The clocks hit 0. Time.

The CROWD goes crazy. Judge and jury.

Future takes center stage, he's hosting the battle.

JIMMY
{Future hands him
the mic)

Future hands him the mic. All eyes on Jimmy. Under the
blinding hot lights. The beat kicks in. The clocks start...

CLOSE ON JIMMY, bobbing his head up & down collecting his
thoughts, opens his mouth to rap and--

People start booing him right away.

Calling him names. RBooing.

Booing.
 

Booing Jimmy. And nothing comes out of his mouth,

Mute. Burning up under the lights. Failure.

Jimny freezes.

And the picture FREEZES.

REWIEDS. And PLAYS again.

Jimmy opens his mouth to rap and nothing comes out. Freeze.
Failure. Rewind. Play. We're SCRATCHING the film.

Back & forth.

Forth & back.

SLAM TO:
MAIN TITLE:

fight
music

We still hear the scratching which leads us into our title
song, the song we first heard playing in Jimmy's headphones...

7.

Poor Detroit. Jimmy runs through the diseased streets of his
life past all the crack whores and dead ends. Holding onto
his garbage bag full of clothes, headphones back on his head.
His breath visible im the night air. He and it the only
white around. We still hear our title song.

Jimmy runs. Runs through a busy intersection, right on by
the entrance of a ratty trailer park, running down a side
street. Running up to a big vacant field down at the end.
Urban blight. Dying grass. A graveyard for shopping carts,
broken appliances, used needles & other shit.

Jimmy stops.
And screams out at the top of his lungs.
Loud and long.

Then he runs to a chain link fence at the edge of the field,
looks both ways making sure no one sees him, and hops over it.

8.

Jimny makes his way through the maze of trailers. Up toa
drab double-wide mobile home. A beat-to-shit big-ass '79
Lincoln abandoned in front. Down. And out.

3. :

Jimmy lets himself in. Drops the garbage bag. He's cold,
blowing on his hands trying to warm himself up. The place is
a dump. All white trash.
 

The title song stil] blaring in his headphones and on our
soundtrack.

JIMMY
Mom?

He heads for his wom's bedroom. As he gets closer, we hear
some noise. Moans. And grunts. A breathless scream.

We hear sex. Raw. And loud.

Not Jimmy. All he hears is msic.

JIMMY
Mom?

He slides open the flimsy vinyl bedroom door and sees his mom
fucking some guy! On top. Riding away~-
Jinmy pulls off his headphones. The title song ends.

cIMMY
(in shock}
Mom! ?!
STEPHANIE
Rabbit?

10.

Later. Jimmy's eating cereal in the lousy kitchen, dry no
milk. A smail TV, beer bottles & comic books litter the
countertops. A rusty electric space heater vibrates heat.
It's almost quiet for the first time in the movie.

His mother, STEPHANIE, slinks in wearing an oversized
"Osborne High* sweatshirt and little else. Her hair's a sex
mess, she slurs her words a little maybe a little drunk.
She's a young 40, small & sexy in that bleached blonde
trailer trash sorta way.

STEPHANIE
You okay, baby - Wan‘me ta make ya
somethin’?
{ruffles his hair)
- Dontchya think maybe ya shoulda
knocked or maybe called first or
somethin'?

JIMMY
Yo - the phone's disconnected.

STEPHANIE
(defensive}
Yeah I know, Rabbit. I know, I jus'
gotta run down to the - um - the
phone place tomorrow -
10.

sIMMy
{mouth full of dry
cereal}

- An' there's no milk. Ever.

STEPHANIE
Hey - I been busy, ya know.
JIMMY
Still gain' to bingo or get a job

yet?

A thick lame white dude, GREG MINOR, stumbles into the
kitchen on one good leg like he owns the place. Just a few
yerurs older than Jimmy, all Greg's got on is a two-day beard,
pair of "Osborne High" sweatvants, and a shit-eatin’ grin.

GREG
{slaps Jimmy on the
back of his head
Rabbit - what the fuck you doin’
here? How ‘bout knockin'?

Jimuy doesn't react. Too tired to fight. It's clear that
Greg makes him uncomfortable. Makes him feel like he's back
in high school. Jimmy seems to shrink when he's around.

JIMMY
{turns to his mom)
Jameane an' I broke up -

STEPHANIE
None of those girls are right for
you, baby. She say she's pregnant?

Jimmy nods.

STEPHANIE
Right. I bet she took the car too -

JIMMY
{doesn't want to talk
about it; gets up)
- I gotta work in the mornin'.

STEPHANIE
- You and Puture still at that
Little Caesars in Warren?

She lights a cigarette. Greg takes it from her, smokes.

JIMMY
No I - ahh - I--
ll.

GREG
C'mon, man, you got fired from
Little Caesars? Nobody gets fired
from Little Caesars -

JIMMY
~ yo I'm too tired for this shit.

STEPHANIE
You stayin" here, baby?

JIMMY
- just for a few weeks 'til I save
enough to get my own place.

GREG
Just like Bob Zurowsky. All your
friends still livin' at home -
aren't they, Rabbit?
{ laughs)
Guys're a bunch a fucking losers -

Without skipping a beat Jimmy grabs a beer bottle & fires it
at Greg's head! It just misses, smashing against the wall--
Greg bolts up, cigarette still stuck in his mouth--

Jimmy instinctively takes a step back.

Violence about to break.

Stephanie jumps in the middle--

STEPHANIE
{screams at Jimmy)
YOU STOP IT! JAMES SMITH JUNIOR!
STOPIT NOW!

dust then a sleepy little angel appears in the doorway of the
kitchen, six-year-old LILY, Jimmy's little half-sister.
She lights up when she sees Jimmy. Runs to him.

He gives her a big hug. Violence broken. Greg laughs, gets
himself a cold beer from the ‘fridge instead.

JIMMY
Yo ~ shouldn't you be sleepin', Lily?

LILY
You woke m up ya know.
{whispers to him)
- will you sing to me?

JIMMY
C'mon - back to bed. It's late.
12.

1. :

Jimmy carries Lily into her little girl bedroom. Neat, clean.
A mountain of stuffed animals on her bed. As he puts her
down, we hear him quietly sweetly lovingly rapping to her.

And he's good. Real good.

Suddenly they hear Stephanie shout out from the kitchen--

STEPHANIE (OS)
Rabbit Ya Hetter Clean AlithissShit
Upinhere Or I'1Ll KickYouout For Good!

Jimmy & Lily look at each other, share a laugh.

12.

Later. Jinmy's picking up the broken beer bottle in the tiny
kitchen. Stephanie stands in the doorway watching.

STEPHANIE
- Rabbit, if you're gonna stay here
you better get along or--

JIMMY
What'd I do? Yo he started this shit -

STEPHANIE
- don't fuck this up for me, baby.
You're not in high school anymore,
okay?

Rabbit pushes the last bits of broken glass against the wall
with his foot. It*'s been a long night.

oIMMy
(sarcastic)
Forget it, whatever. I love Greg.
Can I get a ride to work in the
mornin’?

Stephanie goes over to the kitchen table, grabs her car keys
and tosses them to Jinmy.

TIMMY
- you're lettin' me take the car?

STEPHANIE
Nope. I'm givin' it to ya -
It's your birthday present.

JIMMY
- thanks. My birthday's not for two
weeks, yo -
 

13-

STEPHANIE
(laughs; almost
flirtatious)
You're still my lil‘ Rabbit, right?

13.

The next morning, cold & clear outside the trailer. Jimmy,
trying te start the big-ass '79 Lincoln. Click. Nothing.
Click. Click. It's dead.

JIMMY
(jumps out, checks
his watch)
Shiiit -

BRe's late. Jimmy pops the hood, looks underneath.

dust then a chubby charismatic white hipster named WINK
EPSTEIN aka 3rd Person, ambles up. Early 205, soul patch,
and the harmonies of hip-hop verbalizatian.

WINK
¥o Bunny you back home -

JIMMY
- ain't my home, Wink. How the fuck
you know I was here?

WINK
{smiles)
Please. Who ya’ think you talkin' to?

JIMMY
{slams down the hood)
Don't tell nobody, okay?
(checks his watch;
dirty hands)
Yo I gotta run - gimme a ride to
work? I'm gonna be fuckin' late -

WINK
My mom's got the car -
(kicks the Lincoln)
Yo you should just blow this shit
up, B.

i4.
Jimmy hops the fence at the edge of the dirty trailer park.
Wink hot on his heels.

WINK
- Why we goin' this way?
14.

ogIMMY
(just gives him a
look)
Yo where were you last night?

They head through the vacant field together.

WINK
I heard ya got caught out. People
sayin’ some fucked up shit, boy.

Jimmy stops before he hits the street. Wipes his dirty hands
en his pants, wanting to rum away from Wink and last night
and the trailer park and everything else in his fucking life.

JIMMY
- like what?

He checks up & down the busy intersection making sure no one
sees him, and hustles away from the trailer park.
Wink follows.

WINK
You just gotta bounce wit' Wink, B.
You tha franchise, baby. They just
jealous, like Janeane -

TIMMY
You talked to ‘er?

WINK
Forget it. An' fuck battlin' down
at the Shelter, yo. Justa bunch a
losers who ain’t got deals.

JIMMY
- What else am I gonna do?

WINK
Stay home, Bunny. You ain't goin'
nowhere down at that club. And you
Know 3rd Person's gotchya -

JIMMY
Who?

WINK
3rd Person.
(laughs; pounds his
chest}
Wink's all 3rd Person now. ‘Bout to
blow up, for real. An' I'm takin'
you wit' me, B.

They make it to the bus stop, a few people waiting.
15.

JIMMY ~.
~ bow we gonna do that? I'm takin‘
the fuckin’ bus to work, man.

Jimmy anxiously looks down the street for his bus.

Wink puts his arm around Jimmy's shoulder, bringing him in
close.

WINK
Don't tell no one, but I jus'
recorded a demo up at Paisley Park.

JIMMY
- Paisley Park?

WIM
With Prince. The Artist. 3rd
Person? Prince gave me that name.

JIMMY
You're full a shit, yo - How the
fuck you know Prince?

Wink pulls out an envelope from his pocket.

WINK
- He's friends with Lee Darucher,
man. Serious. I just recorded at
Paisley Park, yo.

Wink opens the envelope, shows Jimmy some photographs.

CLOSE ON PHOTOGRAPHS OF WINK & PRINCE, hanging out in a giant
studio control room. The massive console all Lit up with
bright bright lights.

JIMMY
(impressed)
Shiiit. That's really Prince. You
ain't lyin' -

WINK
Yeah an' [I'm takin' a song down to
96.3, try to get it on. They
playin' one local demo every Friday
night now -

Jimmy's bus finally arrives. Belching black exhaust.

WINK
{puts away the
photographs)
- And yo you got next, Bunny. For
real. Recordin' at Paisley Park -
We can both fly outta here. Right?
16.

15. .

Jimmy on the bus, looking out the window. Poverty. Hard
times & pain. He slips on bis headphones, pulls out a pen
and starts writing on his dirty hand_

CLOSE ON JIMMY'S HAND, letters.

Words.

Rhymes.

CLOSE ON JIMMY'S FACE, closing his eyes.

And we hear the opening lines to the song, a cappella.
And then a beat kicks in, the bass line, and a groove.
And as the words & masic come together in a song,
Jimmy's set free. He opens his eyes...

The bus, the poor, Detroit, it's all ANIMATED. By R. Crumb.
Aud Jimmy, he's a Superman. Costume, muscles, the whole deal.
SUPER.JTMMY. He's rapping the song for all to hear. Jumps up
& bursts through the window of the bus, flying away for good.
Escaping his earthly bonds & dull reality.

Superdimmy flying & rapping over the animated bad streets of
Detroit heading up toward the sun, leaving the earth behind,
flying Icarus high. He flies up up around & around the globe
faster & faster. A blur. Going BACK IN TIME to last night.

LAST NIGHT. SuperJimmy flies onstage in the Shelter, grabs
the mic from LIL' TIC with one hand & with the other squeezes
Tic's animated head right off. Blood gushing everywhere as
SuperJimmy just freestyles cool to the crowd.

The rhymes and the blood flowing fast. The audience applauds
screaming - going crazy - loving all of SuperJimmy and his

music. He finishes & waves goodbye, flying off BACK INTO TRE
FUTURE, heading for the suburbs and the nice part of town...

tTopaAY. The nice part of town. Superdimmy flies over a five-
stax hotel. Up-scale, grand. Still singing his sang.

He darts down toward the back of the hotel and heads through
a big open window, flying into a locker room in the basement.

He dives at a locker changing super fast out of his costume.
And into his uniform...
Shirt. Tie. Veat.

Becoming JIMMY THE BELLMAN. BACK TO REALITY (film).
He takes off his headphones, glancing at his reflection ina
locker room mirror, the song cutting out--

16.
Jimmy hurries up to the front of the fancy hotel lobby, his
tie's a mess, collar askew. He's late.
17.

Slides into position next to-his friend Chedder Bob, and a
thin black bellman in his early 30s named PAUL, who's

greeting guests at the door. Classical music plays in the
background.

PAUL
(to Jimny)
Mr. Springer wants to see you in his
office, James -

CHEDDER BOB
{to Paul)
Puck you, homo -
{straightens out

Jimmy's tie & collar)
You okay?

JIMMY
Axe you drunk?

CHEDDER BOB
(he is)
Shhhhhh. You okay about last night?

JIMMY
Fuck last night, bitch -

17.

CLOSE ON JIMMY, taking shit. Pissed off.
Beat.

MR. SPRINGER (OS)

- is that why you were late again,
Mr. Smith? Well?

Jimmy doesn't say anything just looks down at his hands...
They're still smmdged dirty, lyrics scrawle@ all over them

like strange tattoos. He shifts in his seat and hides his
hands under his legs.

MR. SPRINGER (OS)
What do you have to say for
yourself, Mr. Smith?

Jimmy and his boss, MR. SPRINGER, a dark-skinned white man in
his late 40s with a mustache, are sitting right across from

each other in a cramped basement office. The door behind
Mr. Springer's desk isn't closed all the way.

JIMMY
- You can call me Jimmy.
18.

MR. SPRINGER
Okay. Jimmy. You know we were
hesitant to take you on in the first
Place, Jimmy, because you're friends
with Mr. Zurowsky. But,-- Are you
sure you can cut it here, Jimmy?

Before Jimmy can answer that bullshit question the phone
rings. Mr. Springer snaps it up.

MR. SPRINGER (into the phone)
Rooms division -
{some air goes out of
him; whipped)
- Yes, hon, I'11 be hete at seven...
Yes...Yes, of course I will...Yes?

As Mr. Springer continues to tolerate his wife, Jimmy notices
a girl sitting down outside the office. He shifts in his
seat trying to get a better look through the door.

And catches sight of a HONEY-DIPPED GIRL, maybe 18 or so, so
sexy and indifferent she's obscene, impossible. Short hair.
Long legs. Oh God...

Mr. Springer hangs up the phone, all business.
Jimmy can't keep his eyes off of the girl, the girl.

MR. SPRINGER
Okay, Mr. Smith. I have another
meeting now so - If you're late
again we're gonna have to let you
go. You have to do better,-- I know
you can be a better bellman -

dimmy snaps out of it. Gets up. Shoves his dirty hands in
his pockets and heads ovt. Time to eat more shit.

JIMMY
Yes, sir. [I will -

When he gets to the door he turms back to Mr. Springer.
The girl's now standing right behind him in the doorway.

JIMMY
I guess it's not the right time to
ask for extra shifts, Mr. Springer.
Is it? But I - ahh - really need the
money.

MR. SPRINGER
- I'm sure you do, but let's just
see how this week works out first,
Jimmy. Okay?

(more}
19.

MR. SPRINGER (cont 'd)}
(motions the girl in)
Miss?

Jiumy leaves humiliated, still managing to smile at the girl
as she enters the office. Heading out, he turns back around
pulling his dirty hands from of his pockets & throws up a
middle finger in the direction of Mr. Springer's office--

The Honey-Dipped Girl looks up as she closes the door, sees
Jimay flipping her off. And gives him the finger right back!

18.

Dusk. Parkness falling visible on the ratty trailer park.
Jimmy's working under the hood of the Lincoln. The Future's
kickin® back in the front seat. They hear LYNYRD SKYNYRD's
"Sweet Home Alabama* drift out of the mobile home.

JIMMY
- yo you shoulda seen this girl,
Puture. She was,-- I mean. Shit.
She's perfect, yo.

PUTURE
Perfect? Perfect got a name?

Jimmy shrugs, puts up the hood on his hooded sweatshirt.
It's getting cold. They hear Greg inside the trailer start
singing along with Lynyrd Skynyrd.

FUTURE
- Who the fuck is that?

JIMMY
That dude Greg Minor's practically
livin' with my mom, yo. Met at
Bingo up in Windsor. Neither of tem
ever fucking win -

FUTURE
- we went to school with ‘im, right?

JIMMY
He was a senior with Chedder Bob,
man. I got’. save some money an'

They listen to Greg sing; he's terrible. Hear him turn up
the stereo inside. And Future starts singing along at the
top of his lungs, off-key, making up the words as he goes...
Then he begins to freestyle over the rock & roll beat.
Jimmy takes a turn. Rapping over "Sweet Home Alabama.*
They go back & forth spittin' out verses over the music.
20.

FUTURE

Wink says he knows Prince? What the

music, Jimmy? Wink's jus' talk.
There will be no action, only talking.

TIMMY

~ No, he had pictures, yo. This
could be a r..u1 opportunity for me -

Greg limps out of the trailer singing "Sweet Home Alabama" to
himself, sees Jimmy and Puture working on the car.

They throw hima look. He just laughs and heads back inside
singing his ass off.

PUTURE

Future tries to start the car. It groans. Sputters. Spits.
And starts. dimmy smiles, he fixed it. The Future's up.

Night. The whole gang's riding in the big-ass '79 Lincoln.
Jimmy and Future up front, hip-hop thumping from the car's
shitty radio, tinny speakers tuned to 96.3. Sol, DJ Iz and
Chedder Bob in the back seat gettin' high.

DJ IZ
Yo boy, this is your mom's birthday

Chedder Bob pulls out a bottle of vodka from inside his coat.

JIMMY

CHEDDER BOB
- I heard she got VD.

soL
So what, nigga - I'd still fuck--

Before Sol can finish the car goes black. Cuts off.

The radio. The lights. The steering wheel. The brakes.
Everything, dead. All the power's gone.

Jimmy tries to maintain control of the car.

The guys are screaming.

The ‘79 Lincoln gently coasts to the side of the road.

20.
Later. Dark side of the road. Silhouetted against the sky,
the guys stand around the car like hunters examining kill.

FUTURE
That was crazy -

Jimmy hops in, starts up the car. Lights.
24.

The car running.

JIMMY
- Jus‘ mist be a shart in the
electrical system, yo, whatever.
Let's go -

soL
Uh-vuh. ['m not gettin' back in that

DB IZ
{quiet so Jimmy can't
hear)

- it's a fuckin' deathtrap. I think
his mom must be tryin' to kill ‘im.

CHEDDER BOB
(laughs; whispers)
You think Rabbit's mom's tryin* to
kill ‘im?

Jimmy's ears are so good he hears everything. He jumps back
out of the car--

JINMY
What you say?

CHEDDER BOB
Nothin", Rabbit ~

JIMMY
T hear everythin', yo - my mom ain't

CHEDDER BOB
- Hey I don't wanna die, Rabbit.
(thinks about it}
I mean, I dunno what the fuck I'm

livin' for, but I really don't wanna
die.

21.

They pull into the crowded parking lot of a seedy Chinese
restaurant, STANLEY'S CAFE. Red neon. Kids hanging out
talking groping and getting high. Noise and hip-hop fill the
air. Jimmy gets out of the car first, keeps moving.

The other four slip out with attitude and head for the
restaurant.

Jimmy leads the way. Future right behind him, a few steps in
front of Sol & DJ Iz, Chedder Bob pulling up the rear.
25.

CLOSE ON JIMMY, looking around the parking lot. Outside
himself.
Stops.

His friends catch up to him.

FUTURE
You okay, Jim?

soL
Yeah c'mon, B. Where ya goin' -

they all keep moving. Jimmy stays there for a minute.
Throws up his sweatshirt hoad, hiding.
And finally follows after them.

They pass by a group of kids hanging out under a streetlight
at the edge of the parking lot. Kids spittin‘ out verses.
Kickin' some rhymes. In a circle. This is a cipha.

It's not competitive, just people checking each other out.
Free. And easy.

RU486 joins in, Future leading the way.
Jimmy still trailing behind.

FUTURE
RuU486 is here, my people -
Det us show you the way -

soL
Gonna kick some serious shit -

FUTURE
Yeah, Mista.

Jimny looks out from under his hood. Checks the crowd.
Puture joins in the cipha, spits some alien shit.

He is a motherfucking star. Finishes.

Now Sol's up (Mista Kingpin}. A freak.

A bigger crowd gathers. Bouncing.
We see Wink hustle up, smiling and handing out flyers.

Future pulls off Jimmy's hood, pushes him forward. His turn.
CLOSE ON JIMMY, starting out slowly, unsure, hesitant.
Working into it. Faster. Quicker. Forgetting the crowd.
The words flow setting him free...

Easily the best. The Future laughs, he knows.

While Jinmy's rapping, we see the Honey-Dipped Girl from work
join the crowd. She's with a group of hip young kids.
They all listen to Jimmy. He doesn't see her,

Jimmy finishes.
Dd Iz steps up & smooths out some rhymes.
26.

Jiumy spots two guys beading in bis direction; a solid black
dude with a baseball cap pulled down tight over his face
named PAPA DOC, aka Papa, and his sidekick LC LYCKETY-SPLYT
aka LC & Lyckety-Splyt, a very skinny black clown. They're
beth part of RU486's rival crew, LEADAZ OF THA FREE WORLD,
aka tha Free World. Aka the enemy.

Jimny looks for someplace to run.

LC Lyckety-Splyt jumps onto the hood of a car near the middle
of the cipha--

LC LYCKETY-SPLYT
{hyping; screaming)
LISTEN UP NOW - LEADA2 OF THA FREE
WORLD IN THA MUTHATUCKIN' HOUSE an’
shit! ME AN' PAPA DOC ~ WE'LE
BATTLE ANY MUTHAFUCKAS HERE -

Papa Doc steps up on the car with Lyckety-Splyt.

They now have everybody's full attention. Cipha over.
Jimny takes a step back into the crowd.

His friends all up in arms--

SOL
Yo, told y'all - Papa Doc an‘ LC
Lyckety-Splyt been talkin' shit -

FUTURE
Puck tha Free World, man -
CHEDDER BOR
{yells out)

Yeah, Man. Fuck ‘Em.

LC Lyckety-Splyt looking for someone to challenge, still
working the crowd over, eyes Jimmy and his crew.

LC LYCKETY-SPLYT

Yo all you muthafuckas are weak an'
shit - Lookit RU486, boy -—

(points to Sol}
Mista Kingpin -

(freestyles a few

rhymes about him;

points to the Puture)
The Fu--

Before LC can even say his name Future points right back at
him & yells out-~-

. FUTURE
Shut Up Bitch -

Papa Doc takes a step toward the Future.
27.

PAPA DOC.
(menacing)
What tha fuck you gonna do about it?

Jimmy stands up for his friend.

JIMMY
Yeah? C'mon motherfucker -

LC LYCKETY-SPLYT

(points to Jimmy)
Yo Rabbit ~ B-Rabbit - You don't
wanna battle me, white boy - You
should be afraid. Caught your act
at Shelter last night -

(opens his mouth &

nothing comes out -

& does it again,

then falls over on

the car, choking)
ARAAAABAAAAAH ~

Some people in the crowd laugh. Humiliating Jimny.
And he just fucking loses it, all that anger.

Jimmy yanks LC Lyckety-Splyt off the car by his neck slamming
his head hard into the ground.

The violence real. Ugly. Loud. Past.

Starts kicking him in the face--

Papa Doc dives off the hood, tackling Jimmy to the ground--
Jimmy shoves him away, gets up ready to fight.

Future, Sol and DJ Iz run up getting Jimmy's back--

Chedder Bob trying to act all tough and shit just stands over
Lyckety-Splyt .

And Wink jumps right into the middle of it all--

Pushing Papa Doc away from the fight, staying in the middle.
Breaking it up. It's clear from the way Wink talks to Papa
Doc they know each other. They're friends.

WINK
- Yo what tha fuck, Papa? Please.
Lc's full a shit, yo - Actin' up
like that -

taPA DOC
Stay outta this, Wink. It's none a
your fucking business -

WINK
Just chill, yo -

Papa goes over to help up Lyckety-Splyt.
Puture drags Jinmy away from the fight.
28.

odIMMY -
{insane witb anger)
Pucking Motherfuckers! I'll fucking

Sol, DJ Iz and Chedder Bob help to holé Jimmy back, trying to
calm him down.

SOL
Puck yeah.

CHEDDER BOB
- they don't even know who they

22.

CLOSE ON JIMMY, bouncing up & down. Still wired, on edge.
It's later. He's inside Stanley's Cafe. Old-school Chinese.

Red. Crowded. Hip-hop misic. We hear Sol talkin’ on & on
in the background.

SOL (08)
- This gon be your only opportunity
to blow the both of us. ‘Cause
after we go platinum, you won't even

be able to get to me an' the Future,
baby -

 

Jimmy's standing next to Sol & Future, both sitting on one
side of a booth, a real PRETTY GIRL squeezed in between them.
Chedder Bob alone on the other side. Chinese take-out's

open. Restaurant's closed. Red booths line the mirrored
walls, tables cleared out for a DJ and a dance floor.

CHEDDER BOB
(to Jimmy}
- do you think I got a big head?

JIMMY
What?

PRETTY GIRL
{flirting with Future)
And why're you the Future?

- If ya wan' I'11 puli outta tha

Jimmy looks up and sees the girl, the Honey-Dipped Girl, the
girl (wearing a sexy little concert T-shirt} on the other
side of the crowded dance floor. --

He can't believe it. She disappears into the crush.

Jimmy balis up the flyer and throws it away.

Jimmy, Wink and Chedder Bob snake their way through the mess
of bodies packing the dance floor tight.

hod n d All bumpin' &

They have to shout to be heard--
WINK
- I Dunno Why Future Don't Like Me.

JANEANEB GASKELL, a pretty 20something bombshell smoking &
drinking on the edge of the dance floor.

CHEDDER BOB

Jimmy turns around. Starts heading the other way.

JIMMY
- I Gotta Go.

WINK
What About Your Other Girl, Bunny?

32.

Sees the Honey-Dipped Girl dancing with her friends right

24.

Later. Jimmy, DJ Iz and Chedder Bob standing in fromt of the
restaurant, off to the side. In the bitter cold.

The joint's closing, kids streaming out.

DI IZ
Shit it's coid. Where the fuck's
Wink wit' your girl, yo?

 

Jimmy throws up his hood keeping his head low. Hiding.

TIMMY
(to Chedder Bob)
- You seen Janeane yet?

CHEDDER BOB
Nope.
33.

Wink walks out with the Honéy-Dipped Girl, three of her
girlfriends and a couple guys. They'ze all very young, arms
around each other, high on Ecstasy. Youching, in love.

WINK
Yo Jimmy is it okay if some of us
ride wit' you?

oIMMY
(hides a smile under
his hood}
Yeah.

25.

Jimmy and his friends, the girl and one of her girlfriends,
all walk up to the big-ass '79 Lincoln. The windows all
steamed up.

DI IZ
C'mon. Let's go, I'm cold -
dust then a naked foot slides against the foggy rear window
smidging a view. A girl's ass flashes into frame, a head
bobbing up & down, hands grabbing.
A scream.

CHEDDER BOB
Are they killin’ that bitch or what?

Do 12 opens the back door, a pretty naked leg spills out.

DJ 1Z
- She ain't dead yet.

DJ Iz jumps right in. More screams--

SOL (0S)
What the fuck, yo? Can't you knock
first?

DJ IZ (0S)

It's a car, nicja - An' it's
muthafuckin' cold out -

While Sol & DJ Iz argue, everybody starts piling into the car.
Jimmy and the Honey-Dipped girl suddenly find themselves
standing next to each other. Alone. Eyes meet.

Time for names. She's ALEXANDRA LATOURNO, Alex & Al, and she
shivers just a little bit in the cold.

JIMMY
(slips off his hood)
- hey.
34.

ALEX
(big eyes; fucked up)
You're Jimmy Smith Jr. - right?

JIMMY

She smiles at him. Oh god, she smiled at him.

ALEX
(smiling at him)
It's Alexandra. But nobody ever
calls me that ya know. Sounds like
an old actress or whatever -

Alex slides into the Lincoln. Before Jimmy gets in he hears
someone call out "Hey Rabbit!" from across the parking lot.
It's Janeane.

He jumps into the car.

FUTURE
(laughs, shouts out
from the back seat}
Quick. It’s the baby mama drama!

And Jimmy peels out before Janeane gets close--

26.

Fast car flying. Nine people packed inside tight. Puture «
Sol with their girl on their laps playing around in the back
seat next to DJ Iz & Chedder Bob squeezed together. Up
front, Wink flirting with Alex's girlfriend, Alex on her lap
sittingthisclesetoJinmy driving.

It's crazy, lond. 96.3 on the radio. Fighting, tickling,
laughing, singing. Everybody doing their own thing.
Jimmy trying to stay cool. So close. To her.
35.
It's agony.

ALEK
(low under the music}
~ So you work at the hotel? That

Jimmy laughs, shrugs his shoulders.

ALEX

JIMMY
No, yo - bell man.

ALEX

Not for long ya know -

There's a commotion in the back hetween Sol and DJ Iz
jockeying for position.

DJ IZ

PRETTY GIRL
Who's Sol?

Puture grabs the girl and starts kissing her in the jam.
Sol pushes DJ I2.

soL
Shut up, Izzy -

Sol and DJ Iz fight in close quarters. Chedder Bob sees
Pature and the girl goin’ at it hands all over each other.
He starts barking. Chaos. :

Everybody in front turns to see what's going on in the back.
Alex leaning even closer to Jimmy when she looks, her face
brushes against his, her hand on his shoulder, steadying.
Oh...

Jimmy swerves the car

She falls against him, on him. Over him.
He straightens it back out trying to concentrate on the road.
She leans over, a short distance, almost kissing his face.

ALEX

So he just hits the gas;: he can't run but he can drive faster.
Kick it into HIGH SPEED. we hear another song, letting us
into Jimmy's head--

27.

HIGH SPEED. Speeding up & down the streets of Detroit,
driving into a neighborhood of small two-story brick houses,
parking in front of Wink’s mom's house, a bunch of other kids
parking heading inside smoking laughing drinking yelling
cranking music dancing partying inside, Sol making out with
Pretty Girl while Wink leads a little girl past DJ iz who's
all over some other girl in the corner near Chedder Bob
hanging out drunk alone watching a bunch of young girls
dancing in the living room in front of a big picture window,
including Alex who's moving slow & sexy playfully touching her

Say it again. Alex moving slow & sexy, playfully touching
her friends and herself, kissing them,’ laughing high on B.
Jimmy & Future hanging out drinking on the couch, watching

They look at each other and crack up laughing. All of a
sudden they see Chedder Bob race across the room and jump
into the middle of all the young girls dancing spilling his
@rink barking, jumping & dancing like a freak.

Jimmy & Puture hop up off the couch and join Chedder Bob and
the girls jumping & dancing & laughing. And then Sol & DJ Iz
join in. And Wink. And before ya know it the whole crew's

loving each other and dancing and Alex moves closer to Jimmy.

Moves in and starts kissing him hot & heavy so high needing
to touch him and then they're all over each other and--

cuT To:

2B.

Morning. Jimmy getting cut of the skinny trailer shower,
singing PRINCE's "Sexy M.F." to himself. Grabs a towel.
Dancing silly and sexy, motherfucker.

Suddenly he hears his mother scream out "No!*
Hears the front door slam shut!

29.

Jimmy runs out of the bathroom, towel wrapped around his
waist. His mother’s holding onto a piece of paper. Freaking
out. Lily's on the couch. The TV on.

JIMMY
What's the matter?

STEPHANIE
~ I just got served, goddamnit.

40.

STEPHANIE (cont'd)

He motions to Lily, leads his mom toward her bedroom.

JIMMY
- How many months late're you?

STEPHANIE

JIMMY
Puck Greg ~

They walk into her bedroom. It's a mess. He slides the
flimsy vinyl door shut.

STEPHANIE
Shit - Okay,-- Three months late -

JIMMY
Whaddaya mean "we?"

STEPHANIE

41.

Beat.

STEPHANIE:

~ Really? Prince?

JIMMY
Yeah. Maybe.

STEPHANIE
(still smiling; gives
him a big hug) :
I knew you were a genius. We gonna
be rich, Rabbit!

30.

Jimmy the bellman, unloading luggage from a cart into a
suite. A hip guest in his early 30s named MR. LEONARD is
across the room talking on the phone like Jimmy isn't even
there.

MR. LEONARD [into the phone)
- I didn't sleep with her. I'm in
love with you...Of course I think
you're beautiful..-Hold on -
{puts his hand over
the phone; to Jimmy)
Hey busboy -

Jimmy stops, did the guy just call him "busboy?"
Jimmy holds his tongue, continues unloading the luggage cart.
Mr. Leonard snaps his fingers, motions him over--

MR. LEONARD
Busboy -

JIMMY
Excuse me - my name is Jimmy, Mr.
Leonard. And I'ma bellman, not a
busboy -

MR. LEONARD
(doesn't give a shit
Sorry - can you get me a pack a
Marlboros, man?

JIMMY
Sure, Mr. Leonard -

MR. LEONARD {into the phone)
- sorry, sweetie, I just gotta find
some money for the busboy...You sure
you're okay?
42.

Mr. Leonard turns his back on diumy, looking around the
nightstand for cigarette money.

Jimmy ¢loses his eyes; we hear an angry song thump on the
soundtrack. He opens up...

The room is ANIMATED. SuperJiemy flies at MR. LEONARD. Grabs
the phone out of his hand. Starts strangling him to death
with the chord, rapping out about calling him a busboy.

Mx. Leonard tums cartoon blue. and dies. Superdimmy just
picks him up & throws him out the window, still spitting.
Mx. Leonard crashes down to the ground.

Ana SupexJimey flies up up & away into the sky-

31.

BACK TO REALITY (film). Jimmy, wheeling the cart back to the
front lobby. Pissed off. Runs into EARL, a quiet old
bellman in his 60s, tired. Classical music in the background

EARL
What's the matter?
JIMMY
Some fuckin’ guest just called me a
busboy -
EARL
- Huh?
JIMMY

{raises his voice)
Some Sonuvabitch Called Me A Busboy,
A Busboy, Earl. And now I'm gettin!
‘im cigarettes -

(laughs, leans in

closer}
Lemme ask you, man, how you put up
with all this shit for like 30 years?

Just then, Mr. Springer walks by. Slows down.
Checking up on Jimmy and Earl.

MR. SPRINGER
{already knows the
answer}
On time today, Mr. Sinith?

JIMMY
Yessir -

Mr. Springer smiles, continues on his way.
43.

and Jimmy flips him off behind his back.

EARL
{takes the cart from
Jinmy)
~ sometimes it helps to be hard a
hearing, Jim.

JIMMY
Yeah -
EARL
(smiles)
Or ya could just rip out theix vocal
chords.

What? Earl walks off with the cart.
Jimmy watches him for a moment.
Shakes his head, gets moving.

He passes by the lobby lounge and sees Alex shadowing an
older woman, getting traimed. Serving tea to wealthy old
ladies, mothers & daughters. It's formal afternoon tea, and
Alex is a *tea girl* dressed in a short black skirt, black
hose, black shoes, and white blouse. Sexy in that French
maid way.

Alex looks up and sees Jinmy.

She smiles and discreetly gives him the finger. Flirting.
He laughs.

32.

Jimny, heading inte the hotel's gift shop.

He hears someone call out "Rabbit!"

Shit. It's Janeane.

dinmy looks around. No place to run. No place to hide.
Janeane finally catches up to him.

JANEANE
Why haven't you called?

JIMMY
Yo Janeane - shit, I can't talk

(to the salesperson)
Can I get a pack a Marlhoros?

JANEANE
~ I don't care. I'm your
girlfriend, Rabbit.
44,

cIMMY :
(looks around; lowers
his voice)
Keep your voice down. Shit. I work
here, yo.

Jimmy pays for the cigarettes and heads out of the store.
Janeane follows after him.

JIMMY
~ Ant you're not my girlfriend
anymore. We broke up.

JANEANE
But you took off this time without
even sayin' a word. We weren't even
fighting -

JIMMY
At least I left you the car an' shit.

JANEANE
Was it ‘cause I said I was preqnant?

Jimmy heads down the hallway back toward the front lobby.

JIMMY
{getting pissed}
I can't talk now, Janeane - You
gotta get the fuck outta here -

JANEANE
I just wanna be your girlfriend,
Rabbit -

JIMMY
~ you're gonna get me fired.

JANEANE
(stops; starts to
lose it)
- Just tell me why you left, --
What'd I do, What'd I do - tell me,
ant I'll leave you alone, Rabbit -

dimmy pulis Janeane a: “je, fast. Trying to calm her down.
He looks over to the lounge to see if anybody's watching
them. Alex is working. No one notices him & Janeane.

JIMMY
{keeping an eye on
. Alex; talks fast)
- you didn't do anything, Janeane.
It's my shit.
(more)
45.

JIMMY (cont'd)
I just bad to get out,-- I felt all

JANEANE
{pushes him away)
Fuck You, you ain't willin' to do
the work, Rabbit - what're you
runnin’ from?

JIMMY
- Nothin'.

And Jimuy just walks away.

The classical music playing in
the background.

Janeane keeps up the fight, eyes red--

JANEANE
{calls after him)
Why do you always gotta run away?

He doesn't answer, keeps walking.

JANEANE
RABBIIIIT!

Everyone in the place looks over at Janeane. Jimmy turns red.
He hurries back, putting his arm around Janeane and quickly

leads her out toward the front door, desperately trying to
avoid any further embarrassment .

SIMMY
Janeane, you gotta go -

JANEANE
I'm your girlfriend, Rabbit - you
can't do this to me -

Everybody's now watching them.

Jimmy husties her outside, out into the cold.
Storw clouds loom overhead. It's gonna rain, maybe snow.

JIMMY
C'mon, baby, go home -

JANEANE

+ Ya know everybody's callin' you a
loser from the other night.
46.

JIMMY
Who told ya that?

JANEANE
{she grabs his aru;
holding on)
I heard ya got booed off stage at
the Shelter. Froze up. They're all
talkin' about it -

JIMMY
{yanks his arm away;
hard)
Fuck you, Janeane. Go home.

Jimny heads straight back inside.

Alex is waiting for him by the door, standing next to Paul,
the other beliman.

ALEX
Is everything, ya know, okay?
oIMMY
(keeps walking; head
down)
Yeah -
{quiet so Paul can't
hear)
- Did everybody hear that shit or
what?

Alex looks at him.
ALEX
{hides a smile
Yeah.
Jimmy just shakes his head, walks to the elevators.
Alex follows after him.

ALEX
Was that your girlfriend?

JIMMY
No -

Alex just laughs.
ALEX

-. Hey, can you gimme a ride home or
whatever after work?
47.

33.

After work. Pouring rain. Dark, it's getting darker.
Jimmy's car is parked in an empty lot near the hotel.
He and Alex are inside the Lincoln. Out of uniform.

dimmy can't get the car started. Click. Click.
Dead.

He looks over at Alex. He's still fucked up from his fight
with Janeane. The windows fogging up. It's the first time
they're all alone. Silence. Tension. Are they gonna kiss?

Alex lights up a cigarette, inhales deeply.
Jimmy tries again. Click. Nothing.
Exhales-_

JI mMy
- I think there's an umbrella in the
trunk, yo.

And we hear a more upbeat jazzy version of our opening title
song...

34.

Jimmy & Alex walking in the rain, sharing an umbrella.
Heading for a crowded bus stop. Bright headlights
intermittently cut the darkness.

Jimmy's lost in his own world.

We still hear the song.

A car drives by and splashes a puddle all over Jimmy.

JIMMY
Fuck -

 

{looks down at his
wet clothes)
Fuck fuck fuck fuck -

Alex cracks up. Jimmy throws a fit.

Which make Alex laugh even harder.

We hear the song.

He looks at her laughing, pulls away the umbrella and jumes
into a puddle, splashing Alex.

She's soaked. Kicks water right back at him.

We hear the song.

They make their way down the street jumping and kicking water
back & forth at each other...

And Jimmy starts singin' in the rain, just singin’ in the
rain. Showing off for Alex. Trying to impress her.
Singing along to the song.

Splashing in puddles. Playing with the umbrella.
48.

Singin’ and dancin' in the rain, just sampling some old
fucking movie.

Jimmy finishes the song just as the bus pulls up.
They run to make it, drenched and laughing.

a5.

Jimmy and Alex on the crowded bus. Standing up, packed Light.
Dripping wet. And cold.
ALEX
(leans into him)
- I hate the bus, ya know, it's such
a drag. Makes me look like a loser.
But I'm saving up my money so -

Swinging back & forth, Alex grabs onto Jimmy for support.
She shivers a bit. Turning him on. He shoves his hands into
his pockets, covering. Excited riding the bus.

JIMMY
- How was work?

ALEX
Ya know. Serving tea to rich ladies
and their daughters all dressed up,
thinking they're better than me ~

Jimmy smiles. He knows.

ALEX

- And I know that look, ‘cause I

Alex just looks at him.
An awkward beat.

The bus pulls over for a stop, the doors open.
Jimmy wants to go.

JIMMY

Nice neighborhood.

Jimmy heads out the door. In a hurry.
Hurting Alex's feelings.

JIMMY

diumy gets off the bus in the rain, stays on the sidewalk.
Waits for it to drive away.
And then screams out. Angry. Loud.

Beat.
si.

36. :

Later. Chedder Bob driving Jimmy and Fiture in some old

Stacking speakers and mixers and turntables.

We-should-go-now -
54.

Chedder Bob backs away, keeping the gun on tha Free World.
Siumy just shakes his head. He and Future follow after
Chedder Bob. The sirens getting closer.

They make a run for the car.

33.

Speeding in Chedder Bob's sister's car. He's still holding

Chedder Bob doesn't slow.

Runs the red light--

Zigzags fast between two cars!

The van follows--

A horn beeps!

The van brakes! Skids just missing an oncoming car--
And sideswipes a parked car! Crashing to a stop.

ST.

42. .
Inside Wink's mom's house. Jimmy, Future and Chedder Bob
make their way down some dark stairs, descending into the

fluorescent lit basement. Panelled walls, couch, card table,
shitty TV.

Sol and DJ IZ are setting up equipment. A crate of records,
a mixer, two turntables & a microphone. Wink's got his arm
around some pretty YOUNG GIRL, carrying on.

‘Wanna Be Startin' Somethin’ .*

WINK

You're psycho, man —

Early morning, behind the hotel. Jinmy's getting out of
Sol's mother's shitty car. Sol drove him to work. Garbage

TIMMY
{laughs )
Thanks for the ride, yo - and thank
your mom for lendin' you the car.
I'll see ya after work.
46.

Hours Later. Jimmy the beilman, finishes loading luggage
inte a brand spanking new Porsche parked in front of the
hotel. Everything's SILENT. Except we hear dimmy rapping a
song to himself. Quiet. Simple. Poetry.

He closes the trunk and quickly looks around, never stopping
his music. Everything else still SILENT.

Jimmy slips into the sports car. Checking out the interior.
Suddenly the passenger side door swings open, SOUND crasiing
back--

And Alex jumps in, holding onto her "French maid*® uniform,

Jimmy can't believe his eyes. He looks again.
She's still there.

ALEX
C'mon, let's get outta here -

JIMMY
Where to?
63.

ALEX
(laughs)
Anywhere in this car -

She leans over to give him a kiss, all turmed on. Looks up.
And stops.

ALEX
Uh-ob -

Jimmy follows her eyes...

A chubby guest, MR. KOSKO, is standing there watching Lhem
about to kiss in his new Porsche. Alex just laughs, gets out
of the car and heads for the hotel leaving Jimmy behind.

Jimmy quickly jumps out--

TIMMY
I can explain, Mr. Kosko - I--
KR. KOSKO
{dismissive)
Don't. You're just a terrible

 

bellman -
A frantic woman, Mr. Kosko's wife, hurries up to the car.

JIMMY
(trying to stay eool}
- Your wife's luggage is all loaded
up, sir. Will there be anything
else?

Mr. Kosko's cell phone rings.

MR. KOSKO
There's a blue suit in my room I
need dry cleaned. Do you think you
can handle that?

JIMMY
{forces a smile)
- Yessir. Room 722, right?

47.
Jimmy, running back into the hotel. Looks for Alex. Chedder
Bob and Paul are in the middle of an argument--

PAUL
Call me a faggot again and I'll beat
your ass -
64.

CHEDDER BOB
But you're gay -
PAUL
(hard)
So?

Chedder Bob backs down.

JIMMY
(Laughs)
Yo Chedder Bob, didya see Alex come
in -
CHEDDER BOB
MC Bob.

OIMMY
Whatever. Didya see her?

Cheddex Bob points down the hall.

4g.

Jimmy runs down the hallway. Catches up to Alex.

She's walking backwards, still holding onto her uniform
A crooked smile pasted on her face.~

ALEX
Hey. Why'd ya take off like that
yesterday?

JIMMY

~ It was jus' my stop, yo. And then
I hadda show those Free World
motherfuckers what was up -

ALEX
(impressed)
You did?
JIMMY
Yeah I dia.

She turns back around. They head down the hall together.

ALEX
- Ya know we shoulda just stolen
that fucker's Porsche.

JIMMY
{laughs)
You ever steal a car before?
65.

ALEK
No. But I figure you have, right?
And then we coulda just taken off
for good, whatever -

She turns down another hallway, toward the hotel's giant
kitchen. Waiters & waitresses busy coming & going.

JIMMY
Where ya goin', yo?

ALEX
Pickin' up a little somethin' for
tenight, Fyo" -

45.

In the kitchen. Busy & bright. Alex walks up to a thin
white prep cook, pulls him aside to the corner and whispers
into his ear. Jimmy talks to the other prep cook, CLIO, a
cool black chick. A cheap boom box whines in the background.

JIMMY
- Clio, can you make me a hamburger?

CLIO
Sure thing, Rabbit

Alex makes her way over, slipping some pills (E} into her
front pocket.

ALEX
- Hey why do some people call you
Rabbit?

JIMMY
That's jus' one a my names -

CLIO

(laughs}

‘Cause he's fast - and likes to fuck
a lot.

ALEX
Yeah?

JIMMY
- Yeah.

Alex smiles.
cLIO

Tell ya what, Rabbit - I'll battle
ya for the hamburger -
66.

Some of the other kitchen help overhear. Get excited.
Jimmy notices. Unsure.

JIMMY
Oh 1 dunno -

ALEX
(pushes him)
C'mon, *Rabbit* -

Jimmy looks at her. He cares what she says.

JIMMY
Atight, a’ight ~

Some of the other cooks and disnwashers pipe in.

A couple of ‘em start banging on the counters getting
a beat together.

Gathering around Jimmy and Clic.

And Clio goes first, battling Jimmy.

Freestyling about --

1. Jimmy being a bellman.
2. Always late.

3. And white.

She's pretty good. Finishes. Now it's Jimmy's turn.

Alex watching.
He looks at her.

Opens his mouth to spit and

he goes off, freestyling like mad.

He's fast and clear.

Words flowing, focused, kicking Clio's ass.
Showing off in front of Alex.

He finishes. The kitchen goes crazy. He looks over to Alex.
And she's hot. In love.

By now, more waiters & waitresses are hanging around getting
into it, clapping, dancing. Someone turns up the boom box,
more music. Can anyone say "Hot Lunch” - shit, we're
sampling *FAME.*

A -eenage PUERTO-RICAN DISHWASHER jumps in to battle Jim
Everybody clapping and moving, whooping and hollering.
Music everywhere.

Jimmy battles the dishwasher.
Back & forth.
The rhymes flow.

It's all good.
67.

so. m
Jimmy & Alex leave the kitchen. She's exhilarated.
He's wolfing down his hamburger.

ALEX
That was,-- Ya know, that was
amazing -

diumy smiles as they head down the hall, a bounce in his step.

ALEX
~ You're definitely gonna make it.
Not like all those losers back there.

JIMMY
They're not really losers, yo -

ALEX
They're not recording with Prince -

JIMMY
(between bites)
I should probably get back to work
an' shit -

ALEX
No I think me & you should--

Alex sees the older woman we saw training her the other day,
the tea director, her boss, heading their way.

ALEX
Shit. There's my boss, I'm late -
C'mon -

She grabs Jimmy's free hand, turns around and takes off
running in the opposite direction--

Running together, Jimmy still with a mouthful of hamburger,
running down the hall.

They turn down another hallway, hauling ass and see--
Mr. Springer getting off an elevator.
They screech to a stop.

Searching for an es: ‘pe route, nowhere left to run.

Or hide. Caught between two authority figures.

Mr. Springer sees them, waves and heads in their direction.
Alex checks around for her boss. Jimmy stuck with a mouthful
of food. Chews hard, fast to swallow.

Mr. Springer getting closer.

Jimmy doesn't know what to do with the hamburger in his hand.
Puts it behind his back.
 

68.

Mr. Springer walks up. And Jimmy stuffs the sandwich into
his back pocket.

MR. SPRINGER
Mr. Smith, Miss Latourmo -

ALEX
Hey, Mr. Springer -

Jimmy smiles, swallowing the last of his foad.

MR. SPRINGER
{to Jiumy)
I just wanted to say, Mr. Smith,
you've been doing a much better

job -

JIMMY
- thanks. So how ‘bout those extra
shifts?

Alex catches a glimpse of her boss turning the corner.

ALEX
(so innocent)
Excuse me, Mr. Springer - But I
gotta go change for work. I don't
ya know wanna be late -

MR. SPRINGER
And where are you going, Mr. Smith?

JIMMY
I'm running an errand for a guest,
sir.

MR. SPRINGER
(looks at both of
them)
Okay. Well, get to work -

They walk slowly away from Mr. Springer, Jimmy keeping his
hands behind his ass covering the hamburger in his pocket.
They round the next corner, then take off running again--

Down the hall. Take » turn.
Up to another bank or elevators.

They jump into an open elevator, just as the doors close.

SL.
In the elevator, Jimmy & Alex catching their breath.
It's empty.
69.

They look at each other and start laughing.
Their eyes meet_
Still out of breath.

JIMMY
i (crooked smile}
| - what do you think we should do now?

ALEK
What do you think we should do?

| He leans in closer. Both of them having a hard time catching
; their breath. Excited, turmed on.

JIMMY
You know -

ALEX

He slides his hands down her pants. She moans.

They kiss, still out of breath, pulling at each other's
clothes--

52.
Jimmy, opeming the door to room 722. He pulls her inside and
they fall in on and all over each other. Breathing heavy.

He pushes her up against the door. Pulls up her shirt.
Her face hot and red.

And he fucks her, banging against the door in rhythm with
their breathing and moaning.

JIMMY
How does this feel, do you like it?
Pucking her harder.

ALEL
Yes yes yes

Sitting down, against the door.
Disheveled. Happy. After sex.
He looks at her.

Both sweaty, hot & wet.

Before Jimmy can finish, he hears someone talking at the
door. Good ears. He motions to Alex to be quiet.

It's Mr. Kosko.

They look at each other. Shit.
Grab their clothes, hop into the closet fast.

Inside the closet, trying to stay quiet. Darkness.

They hear Mr. Kosko come into the room, arguing'on the phone.
upset .

OIMMY
(mouths to Alex)
Oh fuck - fuck -

Alex's eyes go wide. A naughty smile.
They can still hear Mr. Kosko babbling away on the phone.

And Alex leans over and quietly goes down on Jimmy.

CLOSE ON JIMMY, biting onto his bottom lip.
Having to stay quiet.
It's so fucking good.

Alex's head bobbing in and out of frame.
Up & down.

58.

After work, late afternoon. Jimmy fixing his car in the
hotel parking lot. He can't stop smiling.

Future, Sol and DJ Iz hanging out.
72.

Sol's sitting on the hood of -his mother's car in the middle
of telling a story--

SOL

Sol jumps off the hood of the car, and starts talking to it
like it was the woman in the laundromat.

SOL

Shit. When ya gonna see ‘er again?

oIMMyY

56.

The sun goes down. Jimmy parks the newly-fixed Lincoln in
front of the drab double-wide mobile home.

Slips on his headphones.

Getting lost in his own world.

S57.

dimmy hurries into the trailer, tuning out.

Walks past the kitchen. Sees Alex and Wink hanging out
drinking cheap champagne with Stephanie.

What?
Jimmy pulis off his headphones. Horrified.

STEPHANIE

- Hey, Rabbit - C'mon in we're

cheap champagne;

flirting)
Dentchya love the car I gave Rabbit

She grabs Wink's hand. He smiles at her.
ALEX

{to Stephanie}
You call him Rabbit too?
 

75.

STEPHANIE

(hisses)
- I gave tim that nickname. When he
was little he had these buck teeth
and big ears and he was so cute,
wike a wittle wabbit -

(to Jimny)
Right, baby?

Jimmy turns red, turms back around. And leaves.

s8&.

Jimmy, walking away from the trailer. Fast. It's almost
dark. Walking through the trailer park.

Getting the fuck outta there.

Out toward the field.

Wink runs out after him. Catches up to him at the chain link
fence.

WINK
Yo where ya goin', B - What's the
matter?

JIMMY

{grabs Wink & throws

him up against the

fence)
- I thought I fucking told you not
to tell nobody I was living here!

WINK
You got nothin' to be embarrassed

Jimmy pushes Wink harder up against the Fence.

WINK
- Shit, yo. We were goin’ to my

Jimmy's so fucking angry it looks like he's gonna cry.

. WINK

C'mon, Bunny. Chill out. Al really

helpin' ‘er find a photographer for
her book that's all ~

A long beat.
76.

WINK
- Did Chedder Bob really sboot at
those guys yesterday?

JIMMY
Fuckit.

Jimmy Jets him go and turns around, headimg back to the
trailer. Wink follows after him.

WINK
- I got some good news, yo. Spoke

Jiumy stops.
JIMMY

Jimmy sees Alex heading their way.
Too late to rum. Alex walks up. Looks to Wink.
Then Jinuy.

JIMMY
Yeah okay -

The three of them stand there for a moment.

Beat.

59.

CLOSE ON A PENCIL, scratching on a wall.

Words. Flying fast & furious.

Rhymes pouring out about all the shit Jimmy sees.

Jimmy and Lily are hanging out in her little girl room.
Stuffed animals. She's drawing. He's a giant. Both in
their own worlds. He shakes his right fist back & forth, in
rhythm. And quickly scribbles some more shit on the wall
above her bed, puking out his feelings.

CLOSE ON JIMMY'S FACE, closing his eyes. We hear the song
he's working on. Opens his eyes...

The trailer park is ANIMATED. Back to the Adventures of
Supexdimmy by &. Crumb. He flies out the window, rapping the
song, flying up over dirty Detroit, heading for the Shelter,
the place where he cartoon kills. Stomms into the club, sees
WINK sitting with ALEX. And somebody else...

It's animated PRINCE!

LEADAZ OF THA FREE WORLD are playing on stage. PAPA DOC, LC
LYCKETY-SPLYT, E and the other two guys. When they see
SuperJimmy enter they make a run for it!

Superdimmy chases after them--
78.

Running through the club, Lyckety-Splyt qrabs Alex hostages.
Papa Dec polis ont an animated gun and holds it to her head.
Wink cowers. SuperJimmy stops. He's still rapping the song.
It's. a standoff.

Superdismy makes eye contact with Prince. They exchange
smiles. And Prince starts singing along with him.
A super duet.

Tha Pree World can't help themselves. The sang's too good.
Getting into the beat. Bouncing. Papa Doc lowers the gun--

and Superdimmy rushes them. Beating them all to the ground.
Prince jumps in and helps out.

They beat the shit out of tha Free World. Blood everywhere.
And Superdimmy grabs Alex, rescuing her. Taking her away.
They fly out the door and into the dark alley.

She can't keep hex hands off of him, kissing him.

Polling at his costume.

He pulls off her shirt and yanks down her animated jeans and
starts fucking her up against the wall, super fast and super
hard--

Suddenly we hear someone shout out--

GREG (VO)
You are such a fucking LOSER!

60.

CLOSE ON JIMMY, startled awake. BACK TO RRALITY (film).
The next day. He's under a blanket, on the ratty couch.
Greg and Stephanie are in the middle of a fight--

GREG
- Just like Rabbit was in high
school. Jesus, the both of ya are,
ya know - fucked -

Jimmy sits up.

JIMMY
Yo did you just call me a loser?

Greg laughs yeah, limps up to Jimmy showing him the eviction
papers.

GREG
Didjya know your mom's gettin’
evicted?

Stephanie follows after him, holding Lily in her arms.
JLMMY :
{grabs the papers

from Greg)
That's none a your fucking business,
Greg -
STEPHANIE

Stay outta this, Rabbit -

(puts Lily down; to

Greg)
Don't worry, baby - I'm gonna take

Okay?

She goes to hug him. He shoves her away. Hard.

GREG
- You're so fucking stupid sometimes!

JIMMY
{jumps eff the couch)
Keep your fucking hands off my mom,
asshole!

Jimmy jacks Greg up against the wall--
Greg shoves him away.

GREG
Get off me -

Stephanie pulls Jimmy away from Greg.

STEPHANIE
Rabbit! Stop it!

Beat. Jimmy looks at his mom. He wants to kill Greg.

JIMMY
(to Stephanie)
How can you let him do that Lo you?

STEPHANIE
(pleading with Jinmy)
Don't do this. Please -

GREG
- How the fuck can I go out with
someone who's homeless?

Lily starts to cry.

JIMMY
{to Stephanie)
Are you just gonna let ‘im talk to
you like that?
BO.

STEPHANIE
Stay out of it, Rabbit -

She goes to calm Lily down.

GREG
- With two bomeless fucking kids.

JIMMY
{flips him off}
Fuck you. I'm outta here -

61.

Grey skies. Storm clouds overhead.

dimmy walks up to Wink's mother's house. Still wired.
Looks inside the big picture window.

Wink's passed out on the couch, the TV blaring.

62.
Wink and Jimmy descending imto the basement. Wink's still
half asleep. It's dark down there.

WINK
- It went good last night - that
shit was sold out - but they ain't
as good as you, Bunny -

JIMMY
- did Alex like it?

WINK
Yeah. A 1lil' bit, ya know - but she

JIMMY
Sol's mom's droppin’ ‘em all off an"

Wink turns on the light. The equipment's stil] all set up.

WINK
Even Future?

JIMMY
Yeah. Why?

The doorbell rings.
81.

WINK .
~ 'Cause I heard he signed you up to

JIMMY
(surprised)

WINK
He's killin’ you, yo. Runnin’ your
life an' shit, B - You don't wanna
be a loser your whole life workin’
at some Little Caesars when you're
like 40, now - Do you?

Wink runs back up the stairs, leaving Jimmy behind.

Starts pacing the room...

Getting more and more agitated.

He sees the photographs of Wink & Prince on top of DJ Iz's
records. Picks one up. Hears the guys upstairs.

SOL (OS)
Where's your mom, dawg?

WINK (OS)
Workin' -

Wink leads Sol, DJ Iz and Future down the stairs.
Jimmy stuffs the photograph into his front pocket.
As soon as he sees Future, Jimmy speaks up.

JIMMY
(angry)
- yo did you fucking sign me up to
battle down at the Shelter this
weekend?

FUTURE
What?

JIMMY
You heard me. Did you sign me up -

Future walks down to the bottom of the stairs.
Looks at Jimny.

FUTURE

You gotta come down. That's the
only way you gon get over the other
night, youknowhatImsayin'? An' the
winner takes my place as host, yo -
That's instant respect -
a2.

Jimmy picks up one of the records and wings it at Future--
He ducks. It misses.

Jimmy walks up in his face.

I JIMMY

Fuck the other night. I'm fuckin'
tired of you always tellin' me what
to do, always thinkin' you know

I told you not to sign me up -

PUTURE

Jimmy pushes hin.

JIMMY

Future looks at him.
Turns and walks away.

PUTURE
Do whatever the fuck ya want, man -
(laughs)
- I don't give a shit about what you

Future leaves.
The guys all just stand there.

Beat.

soL
Shit.

DW 12
What are we gonna do now?

WINK
I wanna go get high -

JIMMY
{turns away}
- No let's do some fuckin* work.

Kick into HIGH SPEED, as the guys start making music. We
hear some song play over--
a3.

63. :

HIGH SPEED. Writing lyrics back & forth fucking around in
the make-shift basement studio bouncing beats and hooks and
shit all off each other bobbing their heads together getting
it right all perfectly choreographed like a dance or a

symphony running faster & faster until they're all just a
blur of non-stop music.

Suddenly Wink jumps in the middle of it all.
Puts up his hands. Stop. Stop.

STOP-- Jump to REGULAR SPEED.

The song ends.

JIMMY
What?

WINK
Al jus' called from work, yo - She
needs a ride to this photographer I
set ‘er up with.

JIMMY
- Does she want me to pick ‘er up?

WINK
I dunno.

soL
Can we come?

64.

It's gonna rain soon. Jimmy and Wink sit in the front seat
of the car parked at the hotel. Chedder Bob's ducking
through the rear window, dressed in his bellman's uniform,
rapping for Sol & DJ Iz. He sucks.

Wink leans over to Jimmy, who's keeping an eye out the window
for Alex. Fidgety. Embarrassed.

WINK
You comin' to 96.3?
JIMMY
(distracted)
Yeah -
WINK

Cool. But the radio DJ was at the
show last night an‘ she invited Papa
Doc & Lyckety-Splyt up. So ya know
they might be there.
4.

JIMMY .
{sees Alex leaving
the hotel)
Puckit then -

WINK
(defensive)
Yo there was nuthin' I could do
about it, B -

Before Jimmy can respond Alex walks up to the car, holding
onto a garment bag. All the guys quiet down.

CHEDDER BOB
- Gotta go, homes. Ya know ya can't
leave old Earl all alone for long.

Chedder Bob hustles back to the hotel. Wink pops out of the
car, letting Alex into the front seat. Then sits right back
down next to her.

Jimmy throws him a look.
It starts to rain.

65.

Rain spits. Jimmy, driving next to Alex and Wink. He can't
even look at her. Doesn't know what to say. Music low.
Alex lights up a cigarette, excited. Sol and DJ Iz lean in.
She's the center of attention--

ALEX
- I saw this model on a TV show and
she was sayin' that looks alone
don't mean anything if you don't
have confidence and self-esteem. Ya
know like a confidence in yourself
that you're you and everything.

Jimmy finally looks at her. And Wink smiles.

WINK
Yeah, Al. And this guy's gonna help
you do that.

=LEX
(to Wink; excited)
- yeah I just wish 1 had more time
to ya know,-- IT mean if I had known
it was today I wouldn't have gone

Wink turns up the stereo, making sure it's on 96.3.
as.

WINK :
Don't worry, yo. I'm sure there'll
be make-up & hair people there.
This is a professional photo
shoot -

Sol leans forward, all smooth and shit.

soL
So how soon we gonna see this
pictorial in a magazine, Alex?

DI IZ
Pictorials are Playboy, yo. In
fashion it's called an editorial,

Sol.
soL
Shut up, Iz. Who gives a fuck -
JIMMY
(yells at Sol; on
edge)

It's just for her book, fool - so
she can get a job.

SOL
- Damn. That's one book I'd read.

Dog IZ
No doubt.

Alex laughs. Jimmy's still uncomfortable.

JIMMY
(to Sol & DU I2}
Alex won a modeling contest and this
guy from Elite asked ‘er to come to
New York City -

ALEX
It's no big deal -

SOL
(impressed)
You won a contest? Por Elite?
I heard a them. Shit - that's the
big time, yo. Who were the judges?
Anybody famous?

WINK
(points out the
window)
Hey it's right over here, B -
BG.

66. .,

Still spitting rain. Downtown Detroit, bleak industrial
buildings. Fog. lonely & blue. Alex crossing the street to
a run-down warehouse, leaving the guys behind in the car.

Jimmy jumps out and catches up to her.

JIMMY
- Is everything okay?

Alex doesn't stop walking.

ALEX
With what?
JIMMY
Us -
ALEX
(without skipping a
beat; cold)

Yeah. But I really gotta go -
They walk together.

oIMMY
You want me to come up -

ALEX
No that's okay.

JIMMY
- You sure everything's okay?

ALEX
I'm justa little hungover from last
night or whatever and ya know I'm
worried that I won't photograph
good. this is really important to
me - Okay?

Jimmy stops.
And she just keeps walking up to the building.

JIMMY
(calls out after her)
Am I gonna see you later?

ALEX
You goin' to the radio station?

JIMMY
- No.
 

87.

ALEX :
(not listening}
Okay. I'11 see ya later then -
maybe we can talk about goin' to see
Prince next week.

He stands there, watching her go. And we hear a some kinda
" remake of THE WHO's “Love Reign O'er Me.*

67.

The sun dies in the sky. Jimmy standing in the drizzle, out
in the fog covered field next to the trailer park.
Headphones on. White out. You can't see any trash.

It's almost beautiful. Otherworldly. And SILENT.

All we hear is *Love Reign Oter Me" in Jimmy's head.

Jimmy closes his eyes and screams.
But we don't hear it, only the song.
He screams loud and long.

Screams his fucking heart out.

He opens his eyes and
sees a giant shape emerge from the fog...

It's a HORSE.

A big brown horse.
Jimmy can't believe it's real.

The horse looks at him, and then begins to graze in the field.
Another horse appears from the fog.

And then another.

And another. One of them has a blue blanket on, "DETROIT
MOUNTED POLICE.*

Jimmy stands there. With the horses, snorting and pulling up
dead grass in the fog.

Jimmy takes off his headphones, SOURD comes mishing in.
The song fades away. He hears police sirens off in the
distance. Jimmy walks up to the big brown horse.

It looks back up at him.

Jimmy's now face to face with the horse. The horse goes back
to grazing. Jimmy rubs its head. The police sirens getting
closer. Darkness closing in.

Jimmy just keeps patting the horse's head.
The song's playing.
The sirens wailing.
as.

66. .,

Later. Still wet and foggy. Jimmy walks up the trailer.
Sees his mom passed out on the front steps.

He stops. The song ends.

He looks at her for a moment.
Then puts an arm under her, struggles to help her up to her
feet. You can tell he's done this before.

STEPHANIE
(coming to; mumbles}
Greg leftme -

JIMMY
What?

Jinmy drags his mom inside.

STEPHANIE
We're gonna goto bingo but, he came

Jimmy, putting Stephanie down in her unmade bed. Goes to
take off her wet shoes.

She gets back up.

STEPHANIE

night. Maybe he'll be there -

JIMMY
You ain't goain' nowhere, Mom -
(gently pushes her
back down)
And you're better off without ‘im.

I DON'T CARE I WANT YOU OUT OF MY
FUCKING HOUSE GET OUT GET OUT GET

She keeps pushing Jinmy out the door.

70.
Night. Jiwmy, driving in the rain. A downpour.
He turns on 96.3. They're playing Wink's song...

And it's terrible. Bad rhymes.
Weak voice.

Jimmy stares at the radio.

He shakes his head.

Can't help but laugh to himself. Future was right.
dimmy shuts off the radio.

Suddenly the car goes black. Cuts off.
The lights. The steering wheel. The brakes. It's dead.
Again,

The Lincoln silently coasts to the side of the road.
Stops.
390.
And Jinumy just sits there.
In the dark.

JIMMY
Fuck -

71.

Jimmy, walking down the dark side of the road. Pouring rain.
Empty neighborhood.

Pouring rain.

He walks up to Wink's mother's house. Soaking wet.

Pears voices. Pouring rain. Takes a quick look in the
window before he heads inside.

Sees Wink on top of some naked girl.

Jimmy takes a closer look.
Pouring rain wherever he goes.

The naked girl rolls on top of Wink.
It's Alex.

The girl is Alex.

Alex.

dimmy, busting into Wink's mother's house. Enraged.
Surprising Wink & Alex on the couch--

She screams, covering herself up.

Wink pulls up his pants, gets tangled up with Alex.

WINK
Yo, B - I can--

dimmy grabs Wink up off the couch, and slams him onte the
ground. Starts hitting him. All that rage.
It isn't a fight. It's a beating.

Alex stands on the couch, freaking out.

ALEX
Leave him alone - STOP IT!

Jimmy pounding Wink. Over. And over. And over again.
It's loud. Wild. And out of control.
Blood splatters on Jimmy's shirt.

Alex jumps off the couch, screaming, crying-
Tries pulling Jimmy off of Wink--

ALEX
LEAVE HIM ALONE! dust fuckin' get

Jimmy gets up, out of breath. Worked up. Looks at her.
Beat. Beat.

Beat.

Is he gonna fucking hit her?

we hear CONTROL MACHETE bang out ‘Si Senior."
And Jimmy takes off. Running away.

73.
Jimny running down the dead streets of Wink's mother's
neighborhood in the cold rain. We still hear the song

pumping-~
JUMP CUT:

Jimmy running, croc-vs the street. Almost gets hits by a
car, slamming on its brakes. Jimmy just keeps running--

JUMP CUT:
Running through another shitty neighborhocd--

UMP CUT:
32.

Jimmy runs up to a plain old. house on a street called Novaro.
Falling apart porch. Lights on inside. The song blasting on
the soundtrack.

Jimmy knocks on the door, screams. Out of breath.

oIMMY
Janeane - fuckin’ Janeane let me
in - I'M FUCKING SORRY - LET ME IN,
PLEASE LET ME IN -

He knocks again.
Janeane cracks open the door.

JANEANE
- What are you doing here, Rabbit?

JIMMY
(catching his breath)
I dunno. I was runnin' and, and
this is just where I ended up - and
I'm sorry, Janeane -
(beat)
You were right and, I'm really sorry.

She looks at him for a moment.
And shuts the door in his face.

Jimmy just stands there.

He puts his hands in his pockets. Cold. And wet.
Feels something in one of them. .-

Pulls out the photograph of wink & Prince.

And rips it up inte little pieces.

Throwing it in the air.

Jimmy sits down on the porch steps. Gut of the rain.
Exhausted.

The. song finishes -

74.

Later. Jimmy still sitting on the porch. Shivering.

And cold. The rain's letting up. The white van pulls over
in front of the house. Dented side. Stereo booming, bass
thumping. Bright lights shine in Jimmy's face.

Jimmy just sits there.
93.

Papa Doc, LC Lyckety-Splyt and the rest of tha Free World
jump out of the van. They all walk up toward the porch.
Papa Doc leading the way, his hat pulled down over his eyes.

PAPA DOC
Yo wassup, man. You ready to go
down?

Jimmy gets up. Sees Alex and Wink get out of the van.
Wink's a mess. Broken nose. All bloody and shit.

Jimmy takes a few steps toward Papa Doc.

JIMMY
(never taking his
eyes Vff Alex)
What?

Papa and the rest of tha Free World surround Jimny.
Wink makes his way over, blood all over his shirt.
Alex stays near the van.

PAPA DOC
You heard me. You ready to go?

Before Jimmy can respond, E, the white guy, hits Jimmy in the
back of the head.

Jimmy falls onto his knees.

LC LYCKETY-SPLYT
c'mon, Rabbit, get back up - Get up,
bitch -

Jimmy gets up, turns around and smashes E.
Then takes a swing at Lyckety-Splyt--
Papa Doc kicks Jinmy in the balls.

Jimmy falls onto his knees again. Papa hits him in the face.
PAPA DOC
You like talkin' shit? Huh? You
fuckin' faggot! You like it?
Jimmy falls to the ground. And then they're on him like

animals. Wink too. All six of ‘em. Kicking him. Yelling
at him.

LC LYCKETY-SPLYT
Fuck you muthafucka!

PAPA DOC
Yeah, faggot -

Jimmy tries to get back up.
94.

Alex just stands there watching. Silent.

WINK
{holding his nose;
kicking Jinmy in the
ribs)
You're gonna fuck with Wink, huh?
You don't know who you're fucking
with! You fucking loser -

The light inside the house goes off. It's now almost pitch
black. The front lawn lit up only by the van's highbeams.

Jimmy tries to get up again. Drops. Falling.
Giving up. The ground.

Soing down.

Letting go.

Falling, falling.

75.
The sun rises. The raints stopped.
It's a new day. The next morning. Light.

Jimmy limps up to the trailer park. His eye black.
His body beat.

Instead of running past the entrance like he always does,
Jimmy just walks right in through the front gate.

At the busy intersection.

Por the whole fucking world to see.

76.

dJinmy limps into the trailer. He looks like shit. Bloody
shirt. Hurt ribs. Face a mess. Stephanie is in the
kitchen, pouring milk for Lily's cereal.

They both look up at him. Horrified.
And run to him.

STEPHANIE
Ohmygod -

LILY
Jimmy!

Lily grabs him around the waist. Stephanie hugs him,
smothering him.
95.

TIMMY .
{winces in pain)
- Basy, easy, I'm okay. I'm a'ight.

Jimmy gocs to the sink to wash up, clean off the blood.
Lily doesn't leave his side.

JIMMY
(to Stephanie)
What's gotten into you? I thought
you wanted me out.

STEPHANIE
- Do you want some goddamn cereal or

She holds up the milk.

JIMMY
Why the fuck're you in such a good

STEPHANIE

JIMMY
Shit -

STEPHANIE
And I won. $3200!

JIMMY
You're fucking kiddin' me -

STEPHANIE
(tries not to smile;
can't help it)
Nope. We're good -

No eviction.

Jimmy looks at her.

And busts out laughing.

Laughing. Laughing so hard he's almost crying.

TT.

Later. Jimmy, making his way through a crowded bus.
There's one empty seat between two older black women.
Jimmy sits down between them.

He just sits there looking off, stuck between the two women.
We're sampling the °5:15* scene from *QUADROPHENIA.*
Jimmy's weary. And in pain. Riding the bus.

No fantasy. No music. No love.
dust reality.

Sitting on the bus.

Leoking straight ahead.

7&8.

The hotel's basement locker room. Jiwny taking off his
shirt, getting ready for work. Purple black & blue covering
his body. Bruised ribs. Chedder Bob's standing next to him,
changing out of his uniform. Done for the day.

CHEDDER BOB
(staring at Jimmy's
bruises)

- Ya know that fuckin' bitch didn't
show up cor work, Rabbit. I bet
shefs gonna get fuckin' fired.

Jimmy doesn't respond.

CHEDDER BOB
And didya hear old Earl strangled
some guest yesterday?

JIMMY
What -
97.

CHEDDER BOB
He tried to kill some dude who kept
snappin' his fingers at ‘im -

Chedder Bob tries to get a closer look at Jimmy's ribs.

JIMMY
(pushes him away)
Fuck off, Chedder Bob -

CHEDDER BOB

C'mon, homes - MC Bob.

(points to Jimmy's

black eye, bruised

body)
And that's some fucked up shit right

[mimes shooting off

a gon in each hand)
Bam! Bam! Bam! Shoot that Alex

Jimmy ignores him, starts putting on his uniform.

CHEDDER BOB
- Ya know there's a battle tonight,
Rabbit. A big one.

JIMMY
Yeah.

CHEDDER BOB
I also heard you got into a fight
with Future. .

JIMMY
Yeah.

He finishes getting dressed.

CHEDDER BOB

whatever?

Jimmy glances at himself in the locker room mirror.
Sees his black eye.

JIMMY
- Yeah.
{looks back at
Chedder Bob}
What the fuck.
oa.

73.

CLOSE ON JIMMY THE BELLMAN, working the front with Paul.
He locks over to the tea girls serving. Alex isn't there.

Classical music plays in the background.
Alex isn't there.

Fuckit. Jimmy turns back and opens the door for some guests,
forcing a smile. Welcoming them to the hotel.

Mr. Springer walks up.

MR. SPRINGER
- Can I talk te you, Mr. Smith?

Mr. Springer's cramped basement office. Jdinmy winces when he
sits down.

MR. SPRINGER
Is everything okay, Mr. Smith?

JIMMY

Mr. Springer stares at him.

Beat.
MR. SPRINGER
Well, you've been on time all week.

99.

JIMMY :
Not really. But I need the money -

MR. SPRINGER
Okay then. You can have Karl's
shifts. You've earned it -

Jimmy nods his head yes. Hides a smile.

MR. SPRINGER
Good. I need you to work tonight.

JIMMY
Tanight?

The puone rings. We hear CURTIS MAYFIELD & LAURYN HILL sing
"Here But I'm Gone™ on the soundtrack.

MR. SPRINGER
Do you want the extra shifts or not,
Mr. Smith?

el.

Later. Jimmy's leaving a room on the 7th floor with the
luggage cart, stuffing some money into his pocket. The guest
closes the door behind him. We still hear Curtis & Lauryn.

Jimmy walks down the hall...
Passes by room 722.

The room he fucked Alex in.
The door's open.

Jimmy stops. Takes a peek inside.

The maid is cleaning the bathroom, just out of sight.
The closet doors are all open.

Empty.

82.
CLOSE ON JIMMY, riding the elevator.
Going down. The song plays on.

83.

Jimmy walks outside of the hotel. Out into the cold night.
Paul's leaning against the wall waiting for a ride, checking
up & down the street, smoking a cigarette. The song ends.

JIMMY
- Big plans tonight?
100.

PAUL
Just goin' dancing with some
friends. But they're late - Why're
you still here?

JIMMY
I'm pickin' up Earl's shift -

PAUL
(laughs)
Crazy what happened, huh?

Paul snaps his fingers. Jimmy laughs, stands there for a
moment. You can see their breath white in the cold.
Paul offers him a drag off his cigarette.

Jimmy takes it. Smokes.

JIMMY
- Yo Paul - You ever get tired of
takin' shit from everybody, people
always tryin' to label you?

Hands the cigarette back to Paul.

PAUL
Nah. I don't give a shit what

Except for Chedder Bob. That guy

PAUL

Yeah. Lucky for you, my friends are

Beat.
JIMMY
(.00ks at Paul;
smiles}
> Thanks, man. Just for a couple
hours, yo - I‘11 come right back.
Ba.

Jimmy hustles down the street to the Shelter. Back in his
own clothes. Out of breath. In pain. There's a mob scene
out front waiting to get in. Twice the size of the last
crowd.

He passes by Sol, DJ Iz and Chedder Bob, who's drinking from
a brown paper bag.

CHEDDER BOB
(sees him; calls out)
Yo Rabbit - wait up!

Jimmy doesn't stop. Keeps on moving, heading down the dark
alley next to the club.

The other guys follow after him.

SOL
Damn, B ~- We gon fuck up Wink or

up 'cause they didn't want you down

Dd 12
{to Sol)

They're at the back door. Jimmy stops. Looks at his friends.

JIMMY

SOL

Yeah. Cool -

CHEDDER BOB
Yeah. Can I come?

JIMMY
(looks at Chedder Bob

for a moment; smiles)
- Sure, "MC" Bob.

as.

Jimmy, sitting backstage on a cheap folding-chair dissin‘
Chedder Bob. Practicing his freestyle. Making fun of him.

People coming & going al] around them in the small backstage
area.

Jimmy's flowing. Chedder Bob just sits there drinking,
taking it. Loving it. Seeing how Jimmy rhymes.
He takes a break.

CHEDDER BOB
{dnumk)
- Ya know I love you, Rabbit.

JIMMY
Yo, stop. JI don't wanna hear that.

CHEDDER BOB
Hey whaddaya want for your birthday?

Papa Doc, LC Lyckety-Splyt, E and the other two guys from tha

Pree World walk backstage. They stop when they see Jimmy and
Chedder Bob. .
103.

Chedder Bob jumps to his feet. Jimmy doesn't.
He just sits there. Cool.

LC LYCKETY-SPLYT
Looky who it is - You really gon try

should be afraid, very afraid -

Jimmy nods his heed, smiles a little. Like a quy who knows
something. Doesn't say shit.

LC LYCKETY-SPLYT
Didn't you already die out there on
stage?
(opens his mouth &
nothing comes out;
choking)
- Didn't he, E? Looks dead to me.

E
Got a black eye.

PAPA DOC
Yo, some guys jus‘ like gettin'

JIMMY
(still sitting down)

CHEDDER BOB
Yeah. And how's your car?

The Future comes backstage.
Papa Doc just walks away.

PAPA DOC
(Laughing at Jimny)
We'll see you on stage, faggot -

The rest of tha Free World follows after him.
Future looks at Jimmy's face.
Shakes his head.

JIMMY
(to Future)
- I gotta get some fuckin’ privacy.

86.
Jimmy and Future hanging in the desolate bathroom.
Back where we started.
104.
Under the harsh green fluorescent light.

FUTURE

Jimmy nods his head. He knows what time it is.
He slips on his headphones, bounces up « down to the music.
Bouncing -

Bouncing.
Bouncing.
Bouncing.
Bouncing.
PUTURE
(lights a cigarette)
+ Yo you got Lyckety-Splyt in the
first round. You okay wit' that?
Bouncing.
JIMMY
- I don't give a fuck who it is.
Ya know?
87.

Jimmy walks on stage. Under the toxic glare of the lights.
People crowded along the edges. The DJ spinnin'. The big
scoreboard clocks on the wall set at 60. LC Lyckety-Splyt's
already there, standing next to Puture. Shit-eating grin on
his skinny little face.
an,

105.

We see the crowd from Jimmy's point of view. It's a mob
scene. Rowdy. Overflowing. Electric. People get ready.
Jimmy sees Alex hanging out with Wink (white bandage over his
nose), Papa Doc and the other two Free World black guys.
Everybody looking at him.

Future smiles Jimmy's way and introduces Lyckety-Splyt.

He's going first.

The DJ lays down a beat.

And LC Lyckety-Splyt's all over Jimmy.

 

Freesty ' about --

1. Jimmy's failure in the last battle.
2. Jimmy being white.

3. Jimmy's black eye.

Jimmy just bobs his head to the beat, looking down, not
reacting to a thing Lyckety-Splyt spits.

The clocks tick down to 0. The crowd shouts.
Lyckety-Splyt laughs.

It's now Jimmy's turn. All the lights are on him. Blinding.
The Future hands him the mic.

Some people start booing.

Yell shit at him.

Booing Jimmy.

Jimmy bounces, collecting his thovghts, tuning out the world.
Not hearing it. This is it. It's just him.
The beat.

Beat.

And Jimmy just goes off--

All the anger povwring out of every mscle in his body.
Into this moment. Forgetting about his pain.

Jimmy's spitting fire.

Right up in Lyckety-Splyt's face.

Ripping into him.

Destroying him.

Cutting him.

If words could kill.

He's so good.

Jiomy finishes.

Beat.

And the crowd goes fucking crazy. Much louder than they were
for LC Lyckety-Splyt. Vocal. Approving. Screaming.

Jimmy won the round!
The Future laughs.
106.

And Jimmy just walks off stage, passing by the Big Bad Dude
from the beginning of the movie. ‘They pound fists.
The Gude knows who he is now.

bs.

Jimmy makes his way through the noise and the crush, heading
toward the bathroom. He sees Alex still with Wink, Papa Doc
and the other guys.

Jimmy and Alex make eye contact through all the bodies in
traffic.

Beat. A moment.

She smiles at him, awkwur2. And gives him the finger.
Flirting.

Jimny just laughs at her. Puts on his headphones.
And walks away.

CLOSE ON JIMMY, walking away. Laughing.
Never looking back.
Holding his head up, black eye and all.

85.

Later. Jimmy, battling E on stage.
In a zone. Fast. Plowing.

Clear & strong.

Touching a higher self.

Time up.

The crowd fucking loves it.

Re exchanges pounds with Future, who takes the mic and hands
it to E.

E's up.

Starts freestyling--

And Jimmy sits down on the stage.

CLOSE ON JIMMY, just sitting there. Quiet. Looking out at
all the people. Ignoring B's rap. Not hearing it.

Not listening. Not caring. We stay on Jimmy the whole time.

E finishes. Scattered applause. Jimmy won again.

Jimmy gets up, walks off.
Sol, DJ Iz and Chedder Bob greet him at the edge of the
stage. They all gather around him.
107.

Puture runs up.

FUTURE
- You are a fucking genius, man.
You in the finals, Jim. You an'
Papa Doc. Yessir, it's a fucking
blessing, youhearwhatImsayin'?

soL
You're gonna whoop that niggats ass -

He ain't got no vocabulary.

dimmy nods his head, game face on.

CHEDDER BOB
{still drank)
~ You worried about what he's gonna
say, Rabbit?

JIMMY
What?

CHEDDER BOB
Like about Wink & that Alex bitch
gettin’ it on ya know - And ya know
you not goin' to Paisley Park and
them beatin' you up and ya know
givin’ you a black eye and shit -

Beat. Jimmy doesn't respond.

FUTURE
(pushes Chedder Bob}
Yo - shutthefuckup, fool!

30.

The finals. The crowd's in a frenzy.
Jimmy vs. Papa Doc.

Both of them on stage-

Neither one looking at the other.
The showdown.

This is it.

Future hypes the c.ampionship.

FUTURE
Give it up y’all - The championship
round, for the right to take my
Place as host on all the open mic
battles. That's the sweetest part
about it, youknowhatImsayin'?
th,

108-

CLOSE ON JIMMY, head already down. Staring at the floor.
Lost in his own world. Total concentration on his face.

He hears Puture finish. Jimmy locks back up.
People scream. Shout. Ready for blood.

And Future introduces him.

Jimmy's up first.

The DJ lays down the beat...

And Jimmy pauses.

He stares at Papa Doc.
Long.

And hard-

Suddenly a smile comes to Jimmy's face. A shining sun.
Beat.

And Jimny freestyles about himself, from his side--

1. About not going to Paisley Park - how it's not real.

2. About getting his ass kicked - by 6 guys.

3. About Wink fucking Alex - and how she blew him in a closet.

About all the bullshit.

Making fun of it all.

Taking away all of Papa Doc's material.
And turning it back on himself.

He's a genius.

Letting everybody know he just doesn't give a fuck.
Abouk anything.
He's found his true voice.

He kills. Finishes.

JIMMY
(yells out at the
audience, giving
them all the finger)
Fuck you - You dunno who I am?
I know who I am -

The crowd goes nuts. Bouncing off the walls. High-fiving
and screaming joy. Ali born again.

Future can't stop laughing. He hands the mic to Papa Doc.

Papa Doc just stanis there. The beat goes on.
The crowd still wild over Jimmy.

And Papa Doc just stands there.
Stares out at the crowd.
Freezes.

He's got nothing.

He knows he's already beat.
109.

It's over.

91.
The lights come up. Night over. Jimmy and his friends walk
through the crowd. They're jumping up & down al] around him,

so excited. Shouting his name out loud, laughing, barking,
*B-RABBIT! B-RABBIT! R-RABBITI®

Everybody else reaching out wanting to congratulate Jimny,
tell him how good he is, loving him, basking in his glow.

Jimmy just keeps walking out. Not getting caught up in it
all.

92,
The crowd flowing out of the club. Hanging outside.

Freezing. Buzzing. Jimmy and his crew make their way
through all the people.

CHEDDER BOB
Yo where we headed, Rabbit?

DJ IZ
You on your way, boy -

SOL
Gomna get that big deal now fa sho -

CHEDDER BOB
Yeah. Fuck Wink. Fuck Prince.
Fuck tha Free World. RU486 IS THE

Jimmy heads off, leaving the crowd and the club behind.
The guys follow.

' I'm late for work, yo. I'll see you

The guys stop. Don‘t know what to say.

, Jimmy just keeps walking down the street into the winter
night.

Beat.
Future runs after him. Catches up.

PUTURE
- You okay, Jimmy?

JIMMY
Yeah - I'm just done wit' all the
bullshit, ya know what I'm sayin'?

FUTURE

Jimmy and Future walk down the street together:

JIMMY

before? .
PUTURE

You mean like the four legged kind?
JIMMY

Yeah -
FUTURE

Why?

Beat.
7 JIMMY

f Fuckit, man - I gotta run.
121.

Jimmy says goodbye to the Future, apd takes off running down
the street. On his own.

Away from his friends.

Away from the crowd.

Away from the club.

Running by himself down the dirty streets of Detroit.
Heading in the opposite direction of everybody else.
Sweet wind licks his face. Cold breath slips his mouth.
We hear our closing credit song.

And the scene beings to ANINATE.
But this time he isn't a superhero flying up in the sky.
This time he's just plain Jimmy. Running.

A little smile comes to Jimmy's face.
He runs, feet solid on the ground.
Faster.

Lighter.

Free.

He runs, Jimny runs.
