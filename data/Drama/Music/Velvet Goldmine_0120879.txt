FEMALE NARRATOR

(British)
Histories, 
like ancient ruins, are the fictions of empire. While everything forgotten hangs 
in dark dreams of the past, ever threatening to return.
 
Sad mists of music rise as we 
FADE UP TO:
 
EXT. A GALAXY OF STARS – NIGHT – 1854
 
We descend, music building.
 
A falling star soars across the sky 
and explodes in lavender sparks. Purple mists clear to reveal the rooftops of a 
storybook Dublin.
 
EXT. OLD DUBLIN – NIGHT – 1854
 
A luminous green spaceship is just 
making its ascent, leaving a trail of pink smoke.
 
In one grand synthetic 
WHOOSH the spacecraft disappears into the sky.
 
EXT- WILDE RESIDENCE – NIGHT – 1854
 
We descend upon a lamp lit street of 
Gregorian townhouses.. A light appears in the lower part of one building. Its 
door opens and a Housemaid steps out. She discovers a small bundle at her feet. 
It’s a baby.
 

HOUSEMAID
            Lord’n heaven-
 
She lifts it into her arms and looks 
up to the sky.
 
The last green traces of the 
spacecraft’s eerie glow can be seen through the clouds.
 
            Madame Wilde! Richard! Come. 
Quickly!
 
A Male Servant appears with a 
lantern, followed by Mrs Wilde, a lean, middle-aged woman in a robe. They 
surround the Housemaid and her miraculous find.
 
CLOSE ON the Baby. Mrs Wild opens the 
blanket and reveals a luminous emerald pin, ornate and antique, clasped to the 
infant’s pinafore. Music rises as we:
 
            DISSOLVE TO:
 
INT. CLASSROOM/IRISH BOY’S SCHOOL – DAY- 
1862
 
TRACK past the ruddy-cheeked faces of 
eight year old school children standing and stating their future ambitions.
 

SCHOOL CHILDREN
I want to Be 
a Farmer. I want to be a Barrister. I want to be a Truck Driver.
 
Settle on the last child in the row, 
a solemn tow-haired boy whose seriousness is betrayed only by the cherry-redness 
of his lips.  A hand-made name card hanging from his neck reads ‘Oscar Wilde’.
 

EIGHT YEAR OLD 
OSCAR
            I want to be a pop idol.
 
He wears the emerald pin on his 
lavender cravat. It sparkles.
 
FAST CUT TO:
EXT. ENGLISH 
SCHOOLYARD -  DAY – 1955
 
SUBTITLE- 
‘One hundred years later...’
 
The camera soars over the Schoolboys 
fighting in a crowd. It isn’t immediately apparent that a century has passed, 
and the child being beaten is not the young Oscar Wilde but a designated 
ancestor.
 
Seven year old dandy Jack Fairy is 
being bashed to smithereens by fellow classmates, as others circle the massacre, 
throwing in kicks for good measure. The school bell rings and the young ruffians 
scurry off, leaving the boy face down in the yard.
 
In 
CLOSE UP Jack lifts his head and looks around. He examines his skinned 
knuckles and notices something shiny between two flagstones. He digs between 
them and loosens the small object. Rubbing off the dirt, he reveals Oscar’s pin.
 
            
CUT TO:
 
EXT. COUNTRY ROAD – SUNSET – 1955
 
Crane over little Jack walking home 
over artificial cobblestones and a setting sun. Music swells as we hear:
 

FEMALE

(voice-over)
Childhood, 
adults always say, is the happiest time in life. But as long as he could 
remember, Jack Fairy knew better.
 
INT. JACK’S PARENTS’ BEDROOM – DUSK – 
1955
 
Very 
CLOSE ON young Jack as he walks through the dark of his parent’s room to his 
mother’s vanity. He clasps the emerald pin to his shirt, stops in front of the 
mirror and looks up.
 
CLOSE ON the mirror: Jack’s lip is 
still bleeding. He touches it. Gently, he rubs the blood over his lips like 
lipstick. There is music and faint sparkles in the air.
 

FEMALE

(voice-over)
Until one 
mysterious day, when Jack would discover that somewhere there were others quite 
like him, singled out for a great gift. And one day...
 
His eyes flash back to his 
reflection.
 
            ...the whole stinking world 
would be theirs.
 
Jubilant guitars (‘Needles in the 
Camel’s Eye’/Brian Eno) as we swish to the mirror where young Jack, is laughing victoriously: ZOOM-IN.
 
            MAD CUT TO:
 
EXT. STREETS OF LONDON – TWILIGHT – 1974
 
A cluster of feet, scrambling down 
the streets of London, teetering on mountainous footwear. The boys and girls of 
glitter rock are rushing excitedly over the Waterloo Bridge, across the Strand, 
down Wellington Street, all to see their favourite glam star perform at the 
Lyceum Theatre.
 
OPENING CREDITS
 
A Cluster of painted faces cram for 
space in front of a chrome bank building doing last-minute make-up and hair; 
they hurry off as we PAN UP to where someone 
has scrawled in lipstick: LAST MIRROR BEFORE MAXWELL!
 
The five skinny specimens scurry on, 
passing other platformed-heeled skinnies as they go. Malcolm, Ray, Pearl and 
Billy of the London trash-band The Flaming Creatures struggle to run in their 
outfits and Arthur follows in the pack.
 
A lean face watches them as they 
pass. He turns away. It’s Jack Fairy, late twenties, gaunt, striking, with old 
rouge hollowing his face. Arthur turns momentarily, recognizing Jack, then 
continues.
 
Some other  passing glitter
kids spot him as the as they pass. Song continues as we:
 
            CUT TO:
 
EXT.  LYCEUM THEATRE – TWILIGHT – 1974 – 
‘NEWSREEL FOOTAGE’
 
Outside the theatre we ZOOM PAST a 
long line of Glitter Boys and Girls; super-foxes and she-bitches, ziggies, 
iggies, shags, queens, straight kids dressed up as queers, all anxiously 
awaiting the first glimpse of flam-rock idol Brian Slade.
 
But, looking closer, there is 
something dark bruised beneath the flash. Some kids look into cameras we 
TRACK UP, past their faces, to the name on the marquee.
 
We hear:
 

BBC VOICE:

(off-screen)
Tonight the 
streets of London are ablaze in sparkle make-up and glittering frocks as the 
boys and girls of the current glam-rock craze pay tribute to their patron saint, 
pop-star Brian Slade and his space-age rock persona, Maxwell Demon.
 
            CUT TO:
 
INT. DRESSING ROOM – LYCEUM THEATRE – 
NIGHT – 1974
 
TV Monitor: BBC Reporter stands out 
side the Lyceum Theatre.
 
CLOSE ON Brian Slade (aged twenty 
five), dressed as ‘Maxwell Demon’: his hair bright blue, his face an eerily 
effeminate mask. He is looking up at the TV screen through the mirror (quiet 
music beginning), before returning his attentions tot  a chessboard in front of 
him.
 

BBC VOICE

(off-screen)
A palpable 
whir of anticipation can be felt outside London’s Lyceum Theatre as fans await 
the final show of Slade’s smash world tour.
 
A young woman with a Maxwell Demon 
haircut, Shannon, is shaking a can of hairspray. Brian closes his eyes as she 
sprays.
 
CLOSE ON Brian’s hand moving a 
knight.
 
Security 
around the performer has tightened following a recent BBC interview in which he 
admitted to premonitions of being assassinated on-stage.
 
Shannon’s spraying stops. Brian 
glances up to her in the mirror.
 

BRIAN
Turn it off.
 
Shannon flips off the set. There’s a 
loud knock at the door.
 
A Man’s head pops around the door, 
the sound of the PA pours in.
 

MAN
Brian? Time.
 
            CUT TO:
 
INT. LYCEUM THEATRE – STAGE – NIGHT – 
1974
 
A HANDHELD shot follows Brian as he 
is whisked to the stage, large ornamental feathers are attached to his outfit. 
Another Assistant with a Maxwell Demon haircut hands him a lit cigarette and a 
glass of red wine on the way. The PA bellows thunderously throughout the hall.
 

ANNOUNCER
Ladies and 
gentlemen...The Lyceum Theatre in cooperation with Bijou Music is proud to 
present...
 
On-stage large fans are turned on, as 
stage hands begin blowing white feathers into the air. The roar of the audience 
builds.
 
A crowd swarms in front of the stage. 
Arthur is carried away from his friends in the surge. He looks back anxiously, 
catching sight of someone in the aisle.
 
A dark figure is slipping through the 
darkness toward the stage.
 
...straight 
back from their fantastically successful European Tour...Maxwell Demon and The 
Venus in Furs!
 
Thunderous applause as the band 
breaks into an intro to ‘The Ballad of Maxwell Demon’.
 
On-Stage: Brian walks theatrically on 
stages and faces the crowd, under blue lights and a storm of feathers.
 
Brief shots in slow motion:
Auditorium: Arthur catches sight 
of...
 
...a shiny object being pulled out of 
someone’s coat and aimed at the stage. It’s a gun.
 
Arthur’s eyes grow wide. It fires.
 
Brian is catapulted into the air, his 
chest exploding in blood. He slowly sails back to the stage.
 
TRACE INTO Arthur, looking back to 
the gunman.
 
A dark figure vanishes amid the 
sudden panic as a chorus of sights takes over all sounds.
 
Very 
CLOSE ON chessboard. A knight takes a queen.

Newspaper headline:
 

SINGER BRIAN SLADE SHOT ON-STAGE
 
            DISSOLVE TO: 

 
EXT. LONDON STREET – MORNING – 1974
 
Arthur stands at the door of his flat 
reading the headline. He looks up to the grey skies over head. The sad, 
plaintive introduction to ‘Hot One’ begins.
 
            DISSOLVE TO:
 
EXT. ROOFTOP – DAY – 1974
 
Very 
CLOSE ON a young Crew-cut Boy, gazing up to the clouds with tears in his 
eyes. We hear his internal whisper:
 

CREW-CUT BOY

(voice-over)
Put out the 
torches!
Hide the 
moon!
Hide the 
stars! 
 
            DISSOLVE TO:
 
EXT. MONTAGE OF FACES – DAY – 1974
 
TRACE past three young Punks, looking 
 up to the skies with open mouths.
 
New Your City Drag Queens, squinting 
into the sun.
 
Two teenage Girls in London, eyes 
closed.
 
As we hear:
 

FEMALE NARRATOR

(voice-over)
For once 
there was an unknown land, full of strange flowers and subtle perfumes, a land 
of which it is joy of all joys to dream, a land where all things are perfect and 
poisonous...
 
            DISSOLVE TO:
 
INT. LONDON CONCERT HALL – STAGE – NIGHT 
– 1972
 
As the song’s intro comes to an end 
and we descend, landing on:
 
A glistening 
CLOSE-UP of Brian, electric skin-tight purple space suit and blonde/magenta 
hair, as he starts to sing: ‘Hot One’.
 
Promo film: Brian portrays Maxwell 
Demon, the tragic space hero, while Trevor, his sexy lead guitarist, ablaze in 
silver sequins, fronts the cosmic back-up band. The combination of camp 
theatricality, melodic melancholy and searing guitar creates a strange mix: 
erotic and violent but elegantly detached at the same time.
 
Song continues as the screen suddenly 
flares white.
 
MONTAGE (ARCHIVAL FOOTAGE): GLITTER KIDS 
– 1972
 
The chorus resumes under a slightly 
hokey Narrator, as we return to the promo film with a crude but hip montage of 
seventies London: shots of young people sporting glitter clothes and hairstyles.
 

NARRATOR
...It 
appears today’s youngsters have fashioned a whole new bent on the so-called 
sexual liberation of the flower power set. The long hair and love-beads have 
given way to glitter make-up and platform shoes and a whole new taste for 
glamour, nostalgia and just plain outrageousness!
 
CROSS FADE with following ‘on the 
street interviews’.
 
EXT. LONDON STREETS – DAY- 1972
 
HANDHELD TRACK past the painted faces 
of young Glitter Kids along the Carnaby Street, Sloan Street, Kings Road etc.
 
EXT. LONDON STREETS – DAY – 1972
 
An Old Woman and Middle Aged Man 
stand in front of a church.
 

REPORTER
Is London 
not shocked?
 

OLD WOMAN

London’s...improving.
 

MIDDLE AGED MAN
Well, I 
think it’s a disgrace, parading around all ponced-up like a pack of bleeding 
woofters. Bloody hell, what’ll they think up next?
 
EXT. LONDON HUSTLER STREET – DAY – 1972
 
TRACK with Brian dressed like a space 
tart, sashaying down a street full of Hustlers and Drag Queens.
 
Brian walks directly into the arms of 
a Sailor in white and kisses him firmly on the mouth.

 

NARRATOR

(voice-over)
And heading 
up this flash stampede is none other than pop giant Brian Slade, who’s stylish 
escapades have paved the way for a whole new breed of performing artists. From 
Curt Wild and The Flaming Creatures, to Jack Fairy and Polly Small. Thanks to 
Slade, today’s youngsters are singing a whole new tune.
 
EXT. LONDON STREETS – DAY – 1972
 
Now, a teenage glitter couple: the 
Young Guy talks as his Girlfriend nods in agreement.
 

REPORTER
So you’re 
saying you’re bisexual?
 

YOUNG GUY
Yeah, I like 
boys, I like girls. They’re all great. There’s no difference is there? ...Mr BBC.
 
EXT. CONCERT HALL – DAY – 1972 – PROMO 
FILM
 
Trevor, Brian’s lead guitarist, is 
being interviewed in front of a small crowd of screaming fans.
 

TREVOR

(on screen, then voice over ‘Imaginary Theatre’, then on 
screen)
Rock music 
has always been a reaction against accepted standards. And homosexuality has 
been going on for centuries. At the moment having a ‘gay’ image is the ‘in’ 
thing, just like a few years ago it was trendy to wear a long grey coat with a 
Led Zeppelin record under your arm.
 
INT. (IMAGINARY) THEATRE – 1974
 
CLOSE ON a hand sliding onto Arthur’s 
crotch. Swish up to Arthur, who sees a sleazy Old Man leaning over, smiling 
faintly.
 
Back to the promo film.
 
EXT CONCERT HALL – DAY – 1972
 
Curt is interviewed.
 

CURT
Everyone’s 
into this scene because it’s supposedly the thing to do right now. But you just 
can’t fake being gay. You know, if you’re gonna claim that you’re gay you’re 
gonna have to make love in gay style, and most of these kids... just aren’t 
going to make it. 
That line, 
‘Everybody’s bisexual’, that’s a very popular thing to say right now. 
Personally, I think it’s meaningless.
 
CARD:
 
A decorative, bright pink card reads:
            ‘Meaning is not in things but 
in between them.’

INT. LONDON CONCERT HALL – STAGE – NIGHT 
– 1972
 
Brian completes the final chorus of 
the song, ending in a crescendo. But, just as the house explodes in cheers, the 
sound and image freeze.
 
A beat of silence, before:
 
NEWSPAPER:
 
A newspaper flies into frame with a 
blast of music. The headline reads:

‘SLADE SHOOTING A HOAX’
 
INT. LONDON CONCERT HALL – STAGE – NIGHT 
– 1972
 
CLOSE ON Brian confiding to camera.
 

BRIAN

I knew I 
should create a sensation gasped the Rocket, and he went out.
 
FREEZE FRAME:
 
Image burns and is pulled from the 
screen. White screen.
 
INT. SCREENING ROOM. (NEW YORK HERALD) – 
DAY – 1984
 
CLOSE ON Arthur’s eyes, as he 
listens to a conversation, still deep in thought, after watching the promo 
newsreel  footage.
 

MALE VOICE
Alright, 
Lionel. You can turn it off now.
 
We hear other voices in the room; one 
or two other figures stand.
 

FEMALE VOICE
I don’t get 
it.
 

MALE’S VOICE 2
What don’t 
you get? It was a stunt. The guy fakes his own murder.

Yeah, but 
why?
 

MALE VOICE 2

Arthur?
 
SWISH PAN to Adult Arthur, a

ARTHUR
Of what?
 

LOU
This – Slade 
fellow?
 

ARTHUR

(non-committal)
What? He’s 
a...early 70’s glam rock singer

Told you we 
could count on Mr Old-Time Rock and Roll!
 
He and Mary snicker.

 

ARTHUR

(tuning to Lou)
Count on me 
for what?

(to Lou)
I thought I 
was on the Reynolds trip.
 

LOU
Well you are. 
But the President isn’t due till the eighth and we need a piece for the 
Weekender now.
 

ARTHUR

(quiet, facetious)
Great.
 

LOU
Aw, now, 
look. Next week is the tenth year anniversary of the whole shooting stunt 
incident. I’d like you to find out what happened. Where he is today. ‘What Ever 
Happened To Brian Slade?’ Okay?
 
Arthur looks away, shaking his head.
 

ARTHUR
And naturally 
you want me for this because I’m the resident Brit, right?
 

LOU
No.
 
Arthur stops.
 
I want you 
because you remember.
 
A smooth 
ZOOM IN to Arthur’s face..

The burnt-out remains of New Your 
City and the subtitle:

NEW YORK CITY, 1984

 
1984 New York is a decadent, 
seventies vision of an apocalyptic future a bombed-out, expressionistic city 
from which most people, wealthy or white, have already fled.
 
Melancholy music.
 
EXT. NEW YORK STREETS – DAY – 1984
 
Arthur walks home through a blue-gel 
twilight. Pulling out we reveal a grey industrial landscape, emptied of colour 
and life. A small line of National Guards Patrol the Area.
 

ARTHUR

(voice-over)
Some 
meaningless prank, a decade old. Why was it suddenly up to me to figure out when 
clearly there was something, something from the past spooking me back? I didn’t 
realize at the time that it was you.
 
Rising in the distance, we hear the 
rumble of a crowd and the echoey bass of stadium rocker Tommy Stone’s song 
‘People Rockin’ People’ over a loud speaker.  A Man’s voice follows, massive 
with echo.

The man passing, a sinewy character 
in his late thirties, flashes a cool glance at Arthur before rushing out of 
sight. (We don’t know it yet but this is Curt Wild.)

Arthur’s reflection through 
flickering glimpses into passing trains and faces looking out.
 

ARTHUR

(voice-over)
Ten years. 
Ten years and the world had changed so completely that the life I led in England 
seemed like someone else’s life. Someone else’s story. Anyone’s but mine.

instinctive shame. Music rises.

lumbers home, deep in though, trying to figure it all out. Slow pan down reveals 
the record under his arm.

Arthur jams the door with a chair.
 
Album cellophane is peeled and 
crumpled.
 
A shiny record is slid out of its 
sleeve and placed on to a turntable.
 
The needle drops and glides into its 
groove, filling the room with a glorious, anticipatory hiss.
 
‘Hot One’ begins.
 
Arthur opens up his new copy of the 
Melody Maker.
 
CLOSE ON the newsprint pages. Arthur 
turns to a fold-our spread on Brian Slade’s stage persona Maxwell Demon.
 
TRACE along a wall covered in glam 
posters and clippings, sketches and keepsakes. Arthur, dressed in a plaid 
jacket, is just leaving.
 
INT. ARTHUR’S LIVING ROOM – MANCHESTER- 
DAY – 1972
 
Arthur slips out of his room and down 
the stairs of his house.
 
His parents, Mr and Mrs Stuart, sit 
frozen in front of the TV. They turn in unison as Arthur slips out the door.
 

ARTHUR
I’m just 
going out for a minute.

Arthur has a ‘cool day’ walking 
downtown Manchester in his skin-tight chest hugging blue small t-shirt, with 
cherry picture on front, and sparking buttons/badges attached.
 
A small group of brightly clad 
Glitter Kids stand around a bench smoking and ignoring everyone around them.
 
The one boy in the group, previously 
seen running late for class, glances over checking out Arthur.

INT. SUBWAY CAR – NEW YORK – DUSK – 1984
 
Adult Arthur staring out of a subway 
car, stopped at a station. Arthur looks out on to the station platform. The

the door.
 
Music rises (‘The Fat Lady of 
Limbourg’/Brian Eno) with the sound of a seventies news broadcast:

CECIL
Quite well.

 
Arthur stands opposite with a 
notepad.
 
...Once upon a

With that Ceil pivots around in his 
wheelchair and takes off down the narrow corridor of the decrepit city hospital.
 
Arthur scurries after, calling out as 
he goes:
 

ARTHUR
So?
 

CECIL
Yes?
 

ARTHUR
What was he – 
what was he like?

Who’s that –

Cecil makes a sudden turn off near 
the elevators. Arthur turns and follows.
 
CLOSE ON Cecil facing a dirt window, 
suddenly quite still.
 

CECIL

(quietly)
Like nothing 
I’d ever seen before.
 
Arthur stands behind, watching him.
 
And in the 
end...like nothing appeared.
 
A quiet draw of music pulls Arthur on 
to a seat opposite.
 
SLOW TRACK into Cecil, recalling a

the comb and stares at his perfect reflection.
 

CECIL

(voice-over)
His real 
name, in fact was Thomas, and his father owned a small tiling business in 
suburban Birmingham. But Brian never cared much for the suburbs and, as a young 
boy, had the rare fortune of spending a summer in London with his aunt –

TRACK along the floorboards of a

curtains and footlights.
 
Brian is creeping along the rim of 
the orchestra pit, observing show and backstage antics alike.
 

CECIL

(voice-over)
 - a figure 
of some ill repute in the Slade family, after she married a cockney in the 
‘entertainment field’ and followed him off to Deptford.
 
Backstage, Brian spots his fat, 
moustached Uncle, the director, ordering people around in a sweaty huff.
 
Brian settles into a sliver of light 
and watches the rest of the performance with intensity.
 
The wiggly, over-painted Singer (a 
man dressed as a dame stuffed into a bustier), is belting out a saucy number.

A comedian with zany-sound effects is 
heard in the distance as Brian tiptoes up a dark stairway.
 
At the top of the stairs he spots a 
dressing-room door, partly open. From inside, he hears the sound of a woman in 
distress.
 
Cautiously, he approaches. He peers 
in through the crack.
 
All we see is a woman’s red-nailed 
hand pushing against a large man.
 
Brian inches the door open for a 
better view.
 
INT. DRESSING ROOM – MUSIC HALL – NIGHT

His fat Uncle, in 
CLOSE UP, spots him and winks. Quick zoom out: revealing him seated on a 
dressing room table, pants open, with the head of the Transvestite Singer 
between his legs, in the throws of fellatio.
 
Brian stares in shock.
 

CECIL

Brian’s 
tender introduction to the theatrical underworld would leave a dramatic

INT. SLADE LIVING ROOM – EVENING – 1956
 
With a musical bang, Brian (aged 
seven) slides into frame, dressed in a black pompadour wig and make-up – as 
Little Richard. He performs ‘Tutti Fruiti’ in his own piercing falsetto, singing 
the song with its ‘original’ lyrics, and playing up each sexual innuendo with 
broad, Little Richard gestures.

He wears a tailored jacket, tight trousers, and has a puffed bouffant – dyed and 
lacquered.
 
As the finish, she asks:
 

MOD GIRLFRIEND
So what are 
you, a mod or a rocker?
 

BRIAN
Six of one, 
half a dozen of the other, really.
 
Brian winks, pecks her on the cheek 
and we pull out. The Mod Girlfriend gets on her bicycle and rides off. Brian 
waves goodbye and turns, joining two 
other Mod Boys, leaning against a wall, posing with cigarettes.
 
A pack of uniformed Schoolboys are 
passing.
 

CECIL

(voice-over)
Taking their 
cue from Little Richard, the swank London mods – short for modernists – were the 
first to wear mascara and lacquer their hair, the first true dandies of pop – 
and known to just about any indiscretion where a good suit was involved.
 
One pretty Tow-haired Boy, busily 
winding a bright gold watch, lags behind the rest.
 
Brian notices him pass.
 
The Tow-haired Boy stops and looks

A Drag Singer lip-syncs with the 
song, on a small club stage draped in gold spangles.
 

CECIL

(voice-over)
For Brian, 
the mods were a glamorous call to arms -  or at least, to London, where, three 
years later, at the Sombrero Club in Kensington,
 
Cecil sits with two middle-aged gay 
friends at a table.
 
I would hear 
him sing for the very first time.
 
The Singer finishes and the club 
cheers. Packed to the gills; the streaming club swarms with the finest of 
London trash and glamour.
 
Everything, 
it seemed, started at the Sombrero. No club in London had more notorious sway. 
And there, at the centre of it was Brian’s American wife, Mandy, who’s dramatic 
transformation to London party girl was a constant source of amusement to us 
all.
 

MANDY
You all know 
me – subtlety’s my middle name. It’s as subtle as the piece of skin between my 
vagina and my anus – ooh la! la!

(laughter)
Now what’s 
that called, I can never quite remember...No man’s land? Oh gosh – my 
geesh, dah-ling! Now, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls – and whomever 
else may be in the house this evening...
 
The club starts to clap and cheer.
 
It is my 
supreme pleasure to introduce all you lovely little minxes here tonight to the 
Sombrero Club’s prettiest star – and my most shimmering hubby! –  I give you 
Brian Slade!
 
Brian walks out from the shimmer of 
spangle drapes, swathed in satin and pearl like a pantomime damsel. His hair at 
this point is long and reasonably straight.
 
He and Mandy kiss and raise their 
joint hands: the perfectly androgynous, bisexual couple of the seventies. Music 
begins as Mandy walks off and Brian steps to the mike, performing ‘2HB’/Roxy 
Music.
 
Cecil stares in quiet, amorous shock 
while his companions make the customary cracks.
 

FRIEND 1
Ooo, varda 
Mistress Bona!

Varda the

FRIEND 1
A tart, my 
dears, a tart in gildy clobber!

(Subtitle: ‘A slut, mates, a slut in fancy clothes!’)
 
Cecil is captivated.         

 

CECIL
Who is he?
 
Friend one is suddenly at one ear.
 

FRIEND 1
Some scrubber 
my dear, I do assure you.
 
With Friend 2 at the other.
 

FRIEND 2
But not that 
scruffy, as I last recall.
 

FRIEND 1
Ooh, you’re 
wicked.
 
Cecil tosses a smirk at both of them 
and stands. He straightens his blazer and heads off towards the stage for a 
better view.
 
Cecil’s friends watch him go, 
incredulous.
 

FRIEND 1
She won’t be 
home tonight.

(Subtitle: ‘He won’t be home tonight.’)
 

CECIL

(voice-over)
So I 
introduced myself. Told him I was developing my own management company, and on 
the look-out for new talent. He introduced me to his wife, asked me what sign I 
was, and before the week was out – we were signing contracts.
 
Brian catches sight of Cecil and 
gives him a little smile.
 
You see, 
Brian believed in the future.

But in 1970, 
rock audiences bred on Credence Clearwater and the Beatles were not entirely 
sure what to make of this particular brand of revolt.
 
On-stage, under a large red canopy, 
Brian performs a song (‘Sebastian’/Cockney Rebel) on acoustic guitar, in a scarf 
and with a white face, still with long hair. Wearing a long purple velvet dress 
and matching sueded boots, he sings with far greater affectation than before. 
For a moment it appears as if he’s become Jack Fairy.

I know, I

Curt unzips his tight leather pants 
thrusting his pelvis to the crowd, he jumps around to face the band, letting the 
pants fall to his ankles, revealing everything.
He bends over and moons the crowd, 
then looks through the gap between his legs.
Standing back up, he faces the crowd 
giving them a front on view of his glistening and glitter covered naked body. 
Grinning and laughing at their varied shouts, he gives them the finger with 
both hands, while proudly thrusting forward his pelvis, then beckons them with a 
‘bring it on’ gesture of his hands.
Finally he jumps to the ground, and 
then stands, deliciously sliding his leather pants over his rear, back to rest 
on his hips.

A guitar amp is turned up full

device.
The audience roars in delirium. 
Someone throws a paper torch on to the stage and all the oil goes up.
 
Surrounded in flames, Curt shrieks 
victoriously, glaring at the audience. 
Brian stands in complete awe of the

In

Brian the alien slithers across the

door.
 
INT. DOLLHOUSE BEDROOM
 
Brian the alien surprises and 
inflatable doll husband and wife in bed whose arms fly up when they see him.
 
EXTREME CLOSE-UP: he gives a look to 
camera.
 
In a hi-speed master (á la Clockwork 
Orange) Brian rapes the wife doll and then the husband.
 
CLOSE ON: Brian’s eyes, blinking 
through the bedroom, window.
 
As the song describes Maxwell Demon’s 
rise to stardom we intercut Brian’s eye blinking through the window with the 
following vignettes in COLLAGE ANIMATION:
 
INT. WHITE SET
 
EXTREME CLOSE-UP of a long match 
being struck and lighting a cigarette. Fast ZOOM OUT reveals life-size 
Brian inhaling from an enormous cigarette holder as he tosses the matchstick on 
to the dollhouse. It goes up in smoke.
 
INT. DOLLHOUSE
 
Through the flames, Brian the alien 
is grinning, jamming on his guitar.
 
            FAST CUT TO:
 
INT. RECORD STUDIO – CONFERENCE ARENA – 
DAY – 1972
 
Music holds on a row of faceless 
Execs (seen previously in the ‘Imaginary Theatre’) facing camera in smoky 
darkness. (One of them we now recognize as Arthur’s boss, Lou.) We hear the 
sound of one person clapping. Everyone looks over. Swish pan to:
 
Jerry Divine (mid-thirties), seated 
alone with a cigar. He wears an Italian ‘fro’ with fat mutton chops.
 

DEVINE

(extending his hand)
            Nice stuff.
 
Brian’s gloved hand shakes it. 
Zoom-out reveals him in a three-piece business suit.
 

BRIAN
            Thanks
 

DEVINE
            Devine. Jerry Devine. 
Personal management. I’m interested.
 

BRIAN
            Oh, well – thank you – but 
I’m afraid I already have management. He’s – 
 

DEVINE
            Not in my opinion.
 
Cecil smiles and waves from his seat.
 
The truth is 
you have talent. That’s plain. But it doesn’t really matter what a man does in 
his life. All that really matters in the end is the legend that grows up around 
him. Now today you’re a talented singer. That’s alright. But I could make you a 
star.
 
Cecil’s eyes bulge.  A quiet swell of 
music begins beneath (the intro to ‘The Whole Shebang’/Grant Lee Philips).

 

CECIL

(standing, angrily)
            And just how do you propose 
to do that?
 

DEVINE
            I will tell you, sir...
 
Devine pushes up a shirt sleeve and 
places his elbow on the railing before him, his other hand joustingly on his 
hips.
 
            When you pin me.
 
Murmurs from the crowd as Cecil bolts 
up from his chair.
 

CECIL
            Well I have never in all my 
life – 
 
Cecil looks around helplessly for 
defence.
 
Everyone just stares at him, music 
rising softly. Zoom in to Brian, furthest away, who looks down.
 
CLOSE ON Cecil, his heart broken. 
Fast track to Devin, poised in the spotlight behind him.
 

DEVINE
            May the best man win?
 
We punch into the chorus of ‘The 
Whole Shebang’.
 
            CUT TO:
 
INT. TV STUDIO – NIGHT – 1972
 
Brian performs the song on Top of the 
Pops, his entire band dressed in sparkling outfits.
 

BBC VOICE

(off-screen)
Earlier 
tonight on the popular chart show Top of the Pops, newcomer Brian Slade 
performed his hit single ‘The Whole Shebang’ – 
 
            PULL OUT TO REVEAL:
 
INT. LONDON PUB – EVENING – 1972
 
TRACK along the line of blokes at the 
bar, staring up at the telly.
 

BBC VOICE
-dressed in 
platform boots and wearing glitter eye make-up. A spokesman for the show, known 
for showcasing pop’s brightest stars, says they’ve been deluged with calls all 
evening.
 
TRACK ends on Cecil, sitting over a 
cocktail in the corner. He watches the broadcast solemnly.
 

CECIL

(*pre-lap  *dialogue from the ensuing scene heard before 
the cut)
The next day 
every schoolgirl in London was wearing glitter eye make-up. And I was out of a 
bleeding job.
 
            CUT TO:
 
INT. CITY HOSPITAL – NEW YORK – DAY – 
1984
 
Cecil shakes his head with a distant 
smile.
 

CECIL
And that, as 
they say, was that. I would not hear another word from Brian – or any of them 
for that matter – ever again.
 

ARTHUR
Have you got 
any idea what ultimately happened to him? Where is he today?
 
Cecil just shrugs.
 

CECIL
Last I heard 
he’d returned to Birmingham, but this was – three years ago? Four? No, I’m 
afraid I can’t help you there. Looks as if it may be unavoidable.
 

ARTHUR
            What’s that?
 

CECIL
The ex. I’m 
afraid. But then ever story needs a contrary opinion, and with Mandy you’re 
guaranteed excess of both.
 
            FAST CUT TO:
 
INT. DIVE CLUB – NEW YORK – LATE DAY – 
1984
 
A bolt of music strikes a dirty  
marquee: ‘APPEARING NITELY – THE DIVINE MISS MANDY SLADE’
Arthur walks past the bartender, 
approaching a lone figure bent over a table, the only person in sight.


ARTHUR
            Miss Slade?
 
Mandy slowly lifts her head and 
squints at him.

 

MANDY
Yeah?
 

ARTHUR
I’m Arthur 
Stuart – from the Herald? We spoke on the phone?
 
She looks at him blankly.
 
I really just 
have a few questions I wanted to ask. It shouldn’t take long.
 
Nothing.
 
Do you mind 
if I – sit down?
 

MANDY
            It’s a free country. Sort 
of.
 
Arthur sits.
 
The Bartender stands staring at 
Arthur as Mandy sits staring into her drink.
 

ARTHUR
What’re you 
having?
 
She looks up at him.
 

MANDY
Scotch. 
Rocks.
 

ARTHUR

(to Bartender)
Make that 
two.
 
The bartender drags off, mumbling.
 

MANDY
Gee. You must 
be after some damn exclusive copy.
 

ARTHUR
It’s a piece 
on Brian Slade?
 

MANDY

(dryly-sarcastic)
No kidding. 
What- sort of a memory jog kind of thing?
 

ARTHUR
Yeah...Well 
it’s been, um,  ten years since the whole false shooting incident.
 

MANDY
Oh And what a 
fake it was! Tricking us all in the end with such an authentic demise.
 

ARTHUR
His career, 
you mean? I mean, do you have any idea what happened to him, where he is today?
 

MANDY
Can’t you 
just, you know, run him through the files? Punch in the name?
 

ARTHUR
Not exactly.
 
Mandy starts opening up a fresh pack 
of cigarettes.
 

MANDY
Because, 
honestly darling, I haven’t spoken with Mr Slade in – seven years, at least.
 

ARTHUR
            Seven years. Wow.
 

MANDY
Wow, yeah. At 
least – Smoke?
 

ARTHUR
No. Thanks.
 

MANDY
No, right 
after everything crashed we- we split...And Brian, he just – 
 
Se lights a cigarette and takes a 
drag.
 
            -became someone else.
 
She turns to Arthur and exhales.
 

(a distant smile)
            But then he always was.
 
The opulent strains of Mahler’s Sixth 
Symphony begin over
 
            DISSOLVE TO:
 
EXT. SOMBRERO CLUB – NEW YEAR’S EVE – 
NIGHT – 1969
 
We follow an elegantly dressed couple 
through a boisterous wind as they approach the doors of the club. Leaves swirl 
through the air and the man’s cape billows as the doors of the club swing open. 
The teenage doorman, Cooper, greets the couple and they enter.
 
Then Cooper, the doorman, turns to 
camera:
 

COOPER
That’ll be 
ten bob to you, mate.
 
REVERSE ANGLE reveals Brian, aged 
twenty-one, looking every inch the London hippie with a mass of blond curls and 
jewellery. He gives Cooper the money and a quick once-over before stepping into 
the club. We follow as ‘Get in the Groove’ by the Mighty Hannibal rises.
 
INT. SOMBRERO CLUB – NEW YEAR’S EVE – 
NIGHT – 1969
 
Brian descends through pink and 
purple light, taking it all in. A swirl of colour as we pan across the room to 
Mandy, close, laughing and smoking with friends.
 
In the corner, glowing in coloured 
lights, a light-up dance floor is pumping with dance.
 
Mandy glows in a sparkling silver 
dress. Then all at once she spots him.
 
Brian, scanning the club catches 
sight of her.
 
Mandy quickly returns to her friends, 
laughing, smoking,.
 
Brian watches.
 

MANDY

(voice over)
It was New 
Year’s Eve 1969: the start of a new decade, - 
 
Brian watches Mandy amid a flood of 
hugs and kisses.
 
-and 
everywhere you went there was this sense of the future, the feeling in the air 
that anything was possible.
 
A sudden crash of symbols and dimming 
of lights directs everyone’s attention to the club’s entrance upstairs.
 
A spotlight is spun around, followed 
by a luxurious swish pan to:
 
The top of the curving staircase. 
There, aglow in shimmering silver, Jack Fairy, the Sombrero’s reigning star, is 
making his entrance. He nods regally and begins to descend, flanked by and 
equally studded entourage: Micki, a pretty boy with afro and fur trimmed jacket, 
Angel, playful dyed red head with silver angel wings, and Cooper previously seen 
at the door. A quiet swirl of music accompanies.
 
            See, Jack Fairy had also 
come to London in the swinging sixties.
 
            DISSOLVE TO:
 
INT. POSH HOTEL LOBBY – EVENING – 1967
 
A black silk scarf falling to the 
floor (music continuing)
 
A delicate hand with nails of black 
enamel and a menagerie of rings reaches for the scarf. We follow it up past the 
lithe, velvety figure of Jack Fairy, who wraps the scarf elegantly around his 
neck and fastens it with the emerald pin.
 

MANDY

(voice-over)
And on 
winding roads, in crowded clubs or hotel bars -  this shipwreck of the streets, 
rehearsed his future glory. A cigarette tracing a ladder to the stars.
 
EXTREME CLOSE-UP of Jack opening a 
small compact. 
Zoom out from mirror, Jack looks up, 
closing his compact and standing.
 
Everyone in the lavishly decorated 
nineteenth-century hotel lobby stares as Jack walks proudly across the room.
Three Waiters appear watching him 
from the distance.
 

WAITERS
Maricon, 
épicčne, sexe douteux...
 
Suddenly Jack glances up.
 
A Gentleman in the foreground turns 
to camera and confides:

Fast ZOOM OUT to:
 
Jack, soft and slightly 
SLOW MOTION, engulfed at the foot of the stairs. A sexy hustler, dressed as a 
1930s sailor, finishes kissing his hand and Cooper presents him with a 
long-stemmed rose. But there is an undertow: the eerie intro to ‘Ladytron’/Roxy 
Music begins to rise.
 

MANDY

(voice-over)
I needn’t 
mention how essential dreaming is to the character of the rock star.
 
Brian, very 
CLOSE. Suddenly someone shrieks, breaking the spell. Mandy bursts through 
bodies with open arms.
 
Jack, 
darling!
 
            FAST CUT TO:
 
INT. DIVE CLUB – NEW YORK – DAY – 1984

            FAST RETURN.
 
INT. SOMBRERO CLUB – NEW YEAR’S EVE – 
NIGHT – 1969
 
Mandy has her arms around Jack and 
her tongue down his throat. He pulls away and she laughs, pulling him into the 
club. As she turns, she spots:
 
Brian – 
FAST ZOOM IN – still staring through the crowds. Closer on Mandy, as Jack 
looks over as well, also seeing him.
 
Brian, 
CLOSE, music building. He spots the emerald pin, dangling from Jack’s ear. We 
hear
 

MANDY

But from the 
moment Brian Slade stepped into our lives, nothing would ever be the same.
 
            DISSOLVE TO:
 
INT. SOMBRERO CLUB – NEW YEAR’S EVE – 
NIGHT – 1969
 
Brian’s face slowly approaching, 
through the crowds.
 

MANDY

(voice-over)
It was his 
nature.
 
Brian’s voice is heard singing with 
the music:
 

BRIAN

(singing; off screen)
You’ve got me 
girl on the runaround,
runaround/Got 
me all around town
You’ve got me 
girl on the runaround
And it’s 
getting me down, getting me down
 
We 
TRACK (slight SLOW MOTION) through bodies to where Mandy stands 
dancing/chatting with Jack and company. Suddenly she turns and sees:
 
Brian approaching. The lights and set 
begin to change: the dancing slows and everything but Mandy and Brian dim and 
recede.
 
Brian takes Mandy’s hand and 
instantly they are surrounded by a cool midnight snowfall. The club has vanished 
into the surrounding darkness, and as he begins to sing to her, we begin a slow 
TRACK around them.
 

BRIAN

(singing)
Lady/If you 
want to find a lover
Then you look 
no further
For I’m gonna 
be your only
Searching/At 
the start of the season
And my only 
reason/Is that I’ll get you
 
The song breaks into a driving bridge 
as we:
 
            CUT TO:
 
INT. SOMBRERO CLUB – NEW YEAR’S EVER – 
LATER – 1969
 
Mandy, in the midst of the teaming 
dance floor, turns to Brian, standing opposite (lights and action having 
returned to normal).
 

BRIAN

            Do you jive?
 
Mandy nods, smiling, and they start 
to dance.
 
            FAST DISSOLVE TO:
 
EXT. FOREST – NIGHT – 1970
 
CLOSE ON a raven, blinking in the 
cool moonlight. We descend through a snarl of black branches to a moonlight 
forest where Brian resumes his tender serenade.
 

BRIAN

(singing)
I’ll find 
some way of connection
Hiding my 
intention
Then I’ll 
move up close to you
 
TRACK continues into Brian’s face.
 
I’ll use you 
and I’ll confuse you
And then I’ll 
lose you
But still you 
won’t suspect me
 
He kisses her.
Mandy closes her eyes.

So I married 
him.
 
FADE TO:
 
INT. MANDY’S BEDROOM – NIGHT – 1970

Fast rack to Brian, standing near the 
door, reflected in the mirror. Quiet music begins.
 
A series of 
CLOSE, DISSOLVING SHOTS:
 
Jack resumes touching up his face in 
the mirror as Brian slowly approaches.
 
Jack’s eyes meet Brian’s in the 
mirror.
 
Brian stops as the mirror, turning 
from Jack’s reflection to Jack. He kisses him hotly on the mouth and withdraws.
 
Jack stares into Brian’s eyes. He 
returns the kiss. Brian presses into him.
 
Suddenly -  the door opens.
 
Jack turns.
 
Brian is gone.
 
FADE TO BLACK
 
T-Rex’s ‘Cosmic Dancer’ begins in

Slow circle around Mandy and Brian as 
she finishes painting his face: the lids of his eyes are blue, his cheeks pink 
with blush, his lips a frosty magenta, hair neatly cropped.
 

MANDY
Times, 
places, people. They’re all speeding up. So to cope with this evolutionary 
paranoia strange people are chosen who through their art can move progress more 
quickly.
 
Brian looks up.
 
Mandy holds his glance.

It was the

Thank you and 
welcome, pop pickers, to Pick of the Pops. I’m Davy Rocket and we have a 
very special show for you today, dedicated to one of pop’s blazing new talents,

Brian Appears through the shimmer, 
ablaze in white light. He wears the emerald pin on a black velvet choker/scarf. 
Below, a small ocean of press (Reporters, Photographers) are shouting ‘Brian! 
Brian!’

JERRY
Yeah, the, 
uh, bloke at the front.
 

REPORTER 1
Brian! Why 
the make-up?
 

BRIAN
Why? Because 
rock and roll’s a prostitute! It should be tarted up! Performed! The music is 
the mask, while I, in my chiffon and taff – well –

- varda the 
message!
 
INT. STUART LIVING ROOM – SUBURBAN 
MANCHESTER – EVENING – 1972
 
Teenage Arthur sits on the floor

His Mother and Father sit behind him

REPORTER 2

What about 
your fans? Aren’t they likely to – get the wrong impression?
 

BRIAN

And which 
wrong impression is that?
 

REPORTER 2

(on TV)
Well, that 
you’re a blinking fruit!
 
On-screen there is uneasy laughter 
and a SHAKY PAN to the press gallery.
 
VERY CLOSE ON Arthur, breathing in 
the electronic waves.
 

BRIAN

(on TV)
Well thank 
you, sir, and no, it doesn’t concern me in the least.
 
Arthur tries to peek at his parents 
without moving his head. Their faces are stony.
 
I should 
think that if people were to get that impression of me, the one to which you so 
eloquently refer...
 
SLOW TRACK into Brian on monitor.
 
...it would 
not be a wrong impression in the slightest.
 
Suddenly Arthur leaps in front of the

ARTHUR
That is me! 
That is me! That that that is me!
 
CLOSE ON TV.
 

BRIAN

I mean,

the impression that you were married and living with your wife in North London –
 
Mandy looks around, anxiously.
 
Brian continues in the glare of the 
lights.
 

BRIAN
I am married, 
quite happily, in fact. I just happen to like boys as much as I like girls. And 
since my wife feels pretty much the same about such things...
 
Lights and TV cameras flash to Mandy, 
who wiggles her tongue at Brian.
 
...I should 
think we’ve been able to make a fairly decent go of it so far.
 
Brian winks at Mandy before – 
complete pandemonium.
The audience, frozen in utter 
perplexity. One reporter gets up and  leaves.
 

JERRY
Alright, any 
more questions? Okay, thank you very much.
 
Mandy looks up at Brian, as the 
distant piano opening to ‘Virginia Plain’/Roxy Music is heard.
 
[NOTE: the several scenes 
following which accompany ‘Virginia Plain’ should be played with tremendous 
speed and energy.]

 

MANDY

(voice-over)
For the first 
time in Brian’s life, he was simply telling it like it was. Did he realize what 
he’d actually done? How could he have? I mean today, there’d be fighting in the 
streets. But in 1972...it was more like dancing.
 
VERY CLOSE ON Brian as we:

We hear:
 

DEVINE

That man out 
there in the white suit is the biggest thing to come out of England since sliced 
Beatles. Outside this country – no one knows who the hell he is. You people, 
you’re going to change all that.
 
FAST ZOOM OUT reveals Devine in the 
foreground. He faces camera, addressing his newly formed staff.
 
TRACE past faces we’ve seen before – 
Jack Fairy’s old entourage: Angel, Micki, Freddi, and Sombrero doorboy Cooper.
 
You guys, 
you’re actors. It’s up to you to change Brian Slade pop singer, into Maxwell 
Demon, space-age fuckin’ superstar! Nothing fantastic about it. Why? Because the 
secret of becoming a star is knowing how to behave like one.
 

COOPER

Hey kids, 
let’s put on a show!
 
Disturbingly 
CLOSE ON Devine:
 

DEVINE
Precisely.
 
EXT. ENGLISH GARDEN – DAY – 1972
 
TRACK OUT from CLOSE-UP of 
Brian aggressively made up, sprayed and varnished by Freddi and company. Brian 
is dressed in a white satin three-piece, posing for photos with his band in the 
eighteenth-century statue garden. The sequence has the feel of a silent screen 
comedy, with Devine as directors in jodhpurs and boots, commanding the company 
of Photographers and crew. Equipment and dress is strictly twenties.
 
When Devine shouts ‘action’, the 
klatch of Photographers explode into shots, their cameras flashing like machine 
guns.
 
Brian is riddled with tiny wounds.

 

DEVINE

( yells)
 ‘Cut! 
Cut! Cut! Sort him out’.
 
His crew inch closer now trying to 
conceal the pain and blood stains, with make up. Brian looks pained and scared 
as they approach.
 
Fast

We sail past Micki, the glamorous 
receptionist, rehearsing various company greetings.
 

MICKI
Bijou Music 
and Associates, good afternoon...Bijou, may I help you?...Bijou, hello?...
 
We pass Angel, press attaché , 
dressed in red. Her walls 
are covered with glamour magazines from the thirties and forties, and everything 
on her desk is cherry red: phone, typewriter, telexes, etc.
 

ANGEL
Slade...Brian 
Slade...Well, darling only the biggest thing to hit rock since the pilgrims!
 
Next, they pass Devine in his 
elevated office.
 
Manager Jerry Devine is perched 
behind his desk in wide lapels and clashing patterns, operatic on the phone.
 

DEVINE
I know 
it’s unprecedented, I know it’s unorthodox, but, sir, if you want Brian Slade, 
those are the terms, you may take them or leave them – 
 
Freddi suddenly pops out, addressing 
the camera.
 

FREDDI

Hazelbourne, a dowdy teenager, who responds automatically.
 

SHANNON
I’m Shannon 
Hazelbourne.
 

FREDDI
Who?
 

SHANNON
I rang up 
about the position?
 

FREDDI
The what?
 

SHANNON
The 
position.

(holding up a clipping)
Assistant 
Clerical Aid?
 

FREDDI
Oh right! 
The position! Brilliant! Follow me.
 
Shannon tries to keep up with Freddi 
who whizzes into the wardrobe room.

Zounds.
 
FAST ZOOM OUT reveals them in their 
new, wildly effeminate stage costumes. Mandy beams as Freddi whizzes by.
 
We hear:
 

FREDDI

(off-screen)
Now, Shannon 
– I realize, of course, your expertise is in the clerical arts, but I was 
wondering if by any chance you’ve ever worked in wardrobe?
 
SWISH to Shannon, standing 
dumbstruck.
 
...either 
professionally or –
 

SHANNON
Umm, no, 
never.
 

FREDDI
Fantastic. I 
think that’s everything.

SHANNON

But, no I – I 
said I didn’t –
 
Freddi walks into the main office.

Everybody?

Song finishes with ‘What’s her name? 
Virginia Plain.’
 

SHANNON
Shannon.
 

FREDDI
Shannon.
 
Everyone smiles, claps or says: 
‘Hello Shannon’. Mandy suddenly looks toward Devine’s office.
 
We hear:


DEVINE

(off-screen)
Excellent! 
Yes, Mr Weinberg! Thank you very much indeed. Cheers!
 
Mighty 
SWISH to:
 
Devine slams down phone. Fast pan up

Extraordinary!
 
Everyone turns.
 

MANDY
What, Jerry –
what?
 

DEVINE
So! Tell me, 
Master Demon...
 
Brian walks in from another section 
of the office.
 
Who is it you 
most fancy meeting – in America?
 
Everyone bursts into cheers. 
TRACK OUT as Mandy and Cooper linger in the lounge area in front of Devine’s 
desk, revealing the Bijou office to be a network of adjoining offices, art deco 
style. Brian remains alone to the side.

Silence on Brian.
 

BRIAN

CUT TO:
 
INT. MAX’S KANSAS CITY – NEW YORK – 
NIGHT – 1973
 
Brian and Mandy are walking into the 
dark, narrow club, followed by Devine, Angel, Freddi and Trevor.
 
On stage, Polly Small, a tough girl 
singer, belts out a gendy-bendy Beatles cover. She’s backed by a gloriously 
trashy, New York style glam band.
 
Rodney, a British rep for the label, 
leads them to a table in the back.
 
Brian looks around as well, expectant 
and anxious, taking it all in. Mandy leans over, pointing out someone.
 
Andy Warhol seated at the back of the 
room, accompanied by, James Dean, and Marilyn Monroe.
 

RODNEY

(off-screen)
There he is.
 
Brian looks over to Rodney who 
points, music shimmering.
 
Dark figures clear frame as we track 
in to the darkest corner of the club. Reveal a shadowy figure slumped over a 
table.
 
CLOSE ON Brian, following Rodney, 
arriving. Somewhere behind the music we hear.
 
Mr Wild...Mr
Wild?
 
Curt lifts up his head, squinting up 
at Rodney. He sits between a beautiful pair of boy and girl Teenage Twins.
 

CURT
Yeah?
 

RODNEY
I’m Rodney – 
from Electra? I have Brian Slade here from England who just wanted to pop over, 
say hello –
 

BRIAN
I just wanted 
to say...I think your music is tops – really, smashing – best of the lot.
 
Curt looks up at him in a junkie 
blur.
 

CURT
Smashing, top 
hole, jolly old – 
 
Curt’s eyes roll up into his head and 
he passes out with his head against the wall behind him.
 
Brian in diffused 
CLOSE-UP. He has fallen in love.

INT. HOTEL MEZZANINE- AFTERNOON – 1973
 
Pan over guests seated for tea at 
posh New York hotel.
 

MANDY

(voice-over)
Now at that 
time, Curt Wild was between management and Brian knew this, of course, and urged 
Devine to pursue the situation.
 
We settle on a corner table where 
Brian and Devine sit with Curt, a black smudge against the crimson and gold 
interior.
 

DEVINE
And so if, in 
that probability, an interest arose in which Brian would serve in some projects 
– possibly, though not exclusively– as...we’re taking our lead from you here, 
Curt... possibly as producer on that project – how might that scenario – purely 
hypothetically– how might that scenario appeal to you at this juncture?
 
Silence as Curt looks back at them 
with the innocence of a drowned rat.
 

BRIAN
What Jerry’s 
trying to say is do you want to come to London and cut a record?
 

CURT
Oh yeah – 
cool.
 

DEVINE
Very good.
 

BRIAN
But how can 
we help you. You must tell us. What do you need?
 
Underneath the table Devine kicks 
Brian in the shin. Curt thinks for a moment, then smiles:
 

CURT
Everything.
 
Brian smiles.
 
See, heroin 
was my mainman. But now I’m on the methadone and I’m getting my act together. 
You come here and say you wanna help and I say, ‘hey, far out.’

(to Brian, softly)
You could be 
my mainman.
 
CLOSE ON Brian through diffusion, 
watching Curt. There are tiny hearts in his eyes.
 

MANDY

(voice-over)
It was pretty 
clear what was happening. It happens every day. But for the world to think it 
was happening, well...
 
Pan to Devine, in foreground, tiny 
dollar signs in his eyes.
 
That was 
Jerry’s particular genius.

Montage of newsreel-style footage 
begins:
 
EXT. MOVIE PALACE – NIGHT – 1973
 
Limousine doors open and Brian and 
Curt, dressed to the nines, pile out. They are instantly obliterated by 
floodlights and camera flashes as they stumble up the red carpet, waving to fans 
like a pair of drunken screen stars.
 

MANDY

(voice-over)
Right away he 
started promoting the two of them like a pair of forties starlets on the swoon – 
a Tracy and Hepburn for the seventies.
 
Song continues.

EXT. CARNIVAL – SET – DUSK – 1973
 
Curt and Brian ride in neighbouring 
rockets on the Space Spinner ride, reeling over the candy-coloured lights of a 
travelling carnival. TRACK-IN as Curt lip-syncs 
to the song and Brian sings the backing arpeggios, his rocket passing Curt’s.
 
Behind them, the lights of the 
carnival recede. They are flying away. Pan up to the starry sky.
 
            
CUT TO:
 
EXT. BRIAN’S GARDEN – DAY – 1973
 
HAND HELD TELEPHOTO shots into 
Brian’s back garden: Brian and Curt stroll with champagne, eventually catching 
sight of the camera. Upon doing so, both begin laughing as Curt jumps up and 
down wildly, and then throws his glass toward the photographer.
 
The music now becomes tender 
(‘Diamond Meadows/T-Rex)

INT. LITTLE GIRL’S ROOM – NIGHT – 1973
 
PAN PAST a forty-five spinning on a 
plastic turntable, and come to rest on the soft, lamp-lit CLOSE-UP of a 
Brian Slade Doll.
 
Opposite, a Curt Wild Doll stands. A 
gentle love scene is being played out by the hands and off-screen voices of two 
young English Girls. The scene is shot romantically, with soft lighting and 
heavy diffusion.
 

CURT DOLL
My career was 
on the skids, mate. And you fished me out o’the muck. You got me back on my 
feet, you did.
 

BRIAN DOLL
It was 
nothing, chum. I wanted to help you make more of that far out sound. I love your 
music, my son, and I love – 
 
The Brian doll turns away. The Curt 
doll walks up to him from behind.
 

CURT DOLL

(softly)
You don’t 
have to say it, mate.
 
The dolls turn toward each other and 
embrace. They slowly, tenderly go down to the floor.

TRACK OUT to reveal the singers amid 
Bijou’s deliriously posh press soirée. Dressed for a fancy ball, Brian and 
company lounge and pose for reporters, all elegantly assembled in a gilded 
banquet room.
 
The princely Brian holds court on a 
gold settee, supported by a den of beautiful Bisexuals. We see Curt Wild, Jerry 
Divine, Micki, Angel, Cooper, Freddi, Shannon, Trevor – and Mandy playing 
hostess. Everyone is dressed in cream and gold velvet, satin, and sparkling 
material. Some of the men are in breeches and white stockings. A touch of Louis 
XIV permeates the room. Reporters, on the other hand, are a dark cluster of 
black suits.
 
The song continues as each ‘actor’ 
answers questions in quoted texts, punctuated by slightly bruising 
CAMERA FLASHES.
 

DEVINE
Every great 
century that produces art is, so far, an artificial century, and the work that 
seems the most natural and simple of its time is always the result of the most 
self-conscious effort.
 
Micki, 
dressed like Marilyn Monroe as Marie Antoinette.
 

MICKI

I am not 
really myself except in the midst of elegant crowds, at the heart of rich 
districts, or amid the sumptuous ornamentation of palace hotels, an army of 
servants and a plush carpet underfoot...
 
Mandy, luminous in platinum curls, 
puffs from a long cigarette holder.

What is true 
about music is true about life: that beauty reveals everything because it 
expresses nothing.
 

FREDDI
The first 
duty in life is to assume a post. What the second duty is no one has yet found 
out.
 
A sudden fanfare and dimming of 
lights reveals the projected backdrop of a stylized big top. A spotlight flashes 
on Brian, who catches a whip and top hat thrown to him from the wings. Fast 
ZOOM OUT reveals Angel in the foreground, reading from a large placard 
on a stand.

SWISH PAN to the klatch of Reporters, 
now perched in the rafters, shouting out their questions to Brian. He answers in 
the style of a circus MC.
 

REPORTER 1
Brian! 
Maxwell Demon is the story of a space creature who becomes a rock and roll 
messiah, only to be destroyed by his own success. Are you saying this is your 
destiny? Are you Maxwell Demon?
 

BRIAN
Man is least 
himself when he talks in his own person! Give him a mask and he’ll tell you the 
truth!
 
We see Shannon holding up cue cards 
for Brian. SWISH PAN to Reporter 2, shouting out:

belief that all dandies are homosexuals?
 
TILT DOWN to Cooper, holding up cue

REPORTER 3
Tell us, 
Brian! Are the rumours true that you and Curt Wild have some sort of plan up 
your sleeve?
 

BRIAN
Oh, yes. 
Quite soon actually we plan to take over the world.
 
Hilarious laughter from the crowds – 
LOW ANGLE.
 
CLOSE ON Brian: he wasn’t joking. But 
to the rescue.
 
Curt arrives, miraculously unspilled.
 

CURT
Excuse me, 
fellas, while I raise my glass to the loveliest man in Europe!
 
The crowd ‘Ahhhs’ and Curt and Brian 
smiling broadly, link arms for a toast, cameras flashing.
 

BRIAN
And they tell 
you it’s not natural!
 
Violent laughter from the crowds 
quickly darkens and distorts. Lights dim as a shimmer of music rises.

is dressed in tight silver pants and a black top. He hooks up his guitar and 
gets ready to play. The song continues through the brief montage.

wrenching guitar solo. He half-smiles when he sees:

approaching. When he arrives, he drops to his knees and ‘goes down’ on Curt’s 
guitar, grabbing on to his ass as he plays the instrument with his teeth..

He throws down the newspaper and

INT. HOTEL SUITE – NEW YORK – NIGHT –

Two Glam Girls are leading Curt to a 
corner couch, bringing us to Trevor and Harley, who stand opposite each other 
shirtless. Angel is going down on Trevor while a Girl Groupie caresses Harley. A 
Boy Groupie sits beside her watching as Trevor and Harley stare at one another’s 
bodies, stone drunk.
 
Mandy is lying in a through of Skinny

Thank God – a

Passing over a large red velvet sofa 
we discover a beautiful Asian Woman in bright-blue feathers undressing a man. 
She is accompanied by a nude Black Boy who kisses the man while pulling off his 
tie. The TRACK ENDS on a CLOSE UP of the 
man. It’s Brian.
 
All of a sudden he glances up.
 
Curt stands near a doorway, his eyes 
on Brian. He has broken away from his captors.
 
Brian stares back, frozen. The Asian 
woman tries to kiss him.
 
Curt just turns, disappearing down

Listen, once

A faint melody rises. Music builds to 
‘My Unclean’/Wylde Rattz as slow ZOOMS begin on each of them.
 
And not even 
the real Curt. It was the idea of Curt more than anything, this – image. Which, 
of course, no one could ever possibly live up to. I mean Maxwell Demon, Curt 
Wild – they were fictions! Somewhere along the way, Brian seemed to get

Alright. Cut

is there a problem?
 
INSIDE BOOTH:
From Curt’s
POV we see Brian. Brian’s response is monitored for Curt but barely 
heard. Through the glass we can read his lips-
 

BRIAN
Because you 
missed your cue.

(looks down, quiet, but now audible)
Again.
 

CURT
What? 
What?
 
CONTROL ROOM
 
Devine leans into the intercom and 
chimes in, tersely.
 

DEVINE
We’re sorry, 
Curt, but it appears as if you –
 


CURT

(Curt glares at him through the glass, points to Brian 
awaiting an answer from HIM.)
What?!!
 
Brian leans in.
 

BRIAN

(smoothly)
Curt, we only 
ask that when you decide to make a change you simply inform us in advance 
so Eton here is properly prepared, otherwise –
 
Curt turns violently, thrusting his 
arm as he curses.
 

CURT

(on intercom)
What the fuck 
are you talking about man? – I didn’t make any fucking changes!
 
Brain walks up to the glass silently.
 
            Brian?-

(jerking away in frustration, throws his head set to the 
ground)
Fucking mother fucker! Mother 
fucker, you’re a mother fucker! Fuck you! Fuck you, mother fucker! Fuck you!!
 

DEVINE
Eton 
....Eton, please.
 
The Mixer switches Curt off. We watch 
him continue to rave in silence as Brian listens to Devine.
 
Brian, I’m 
sort to be the one to tell you this, but what started off as an interesting 
experiment has quite frankly descended into demeaning wast of your time and 
mine. I mean you’ve already spent– forty hours studio time –
 

BRIAN
Thirty-six.
 

DEVINE
Whatever! 
Thirty-six hours – on two, three bloody cuts! Brian, you seem to forget, but 
you’re a very big star now and your time is worth a great deal more than this –

 
Jerry  switches on the intercom and 
Curt’s shrieks come searing on.
 

CURT
-fucking 
space-queen on your fucking high horse! And all your fucking henchmen! –  fuck 
you, fuck you!
 
Brian switches it off and responds 
quickly and quietly.

 

BRIAN
Perhaps it’s 
time for another little break. Hey fellas? Give us a stretch.

(a wan smile)
Jerry?
 
Devine stands, coolly.
 

DEVINE
I can’t risk 
extending his contract, Brian. I think it’s quite clear why. I’ll talk to you 
tomorrow.
 
He turns and begins filing out with 
the others. RACK to Brian in the foreground, 
watching Curt.
 
He has begun throwing chairs around 
the booth. Brian turns away, black in shadows. Everyone has gone but Mandy, who 
watches Brian from a dark corner.
 
For a split second his sadness shows. 
Then his eyes flash up and he sees her.
 
She looks him in the eye. Then she 
turns and leaves the room. We follow. As the door shuts behind her, and the 
sound of Curt’s shouts resume in the distance, a tender instrumental of the 
previous song rises.
 
Mandy passes through the shadows, 
into moonlight.
 
EXT. RECORDING STUDIO – NIGHT – 1974
 
Mandy looks up.
 
The sky is full of stars. Then – 
suddenly – there’s a crash of doors.
 
In a massive 
LONG SHOT Mandy watches Curt come tearing out of a rear door. The third-story 
window bangs open and Brian’s head sticks out, shouting after him.
 

BRIAN
Piss off, 
then! Go on! Back to your wolves! Your junkie twerps! Your bloody shock 
treatment! And fuck you too!
 
Mandy watches
Brian watching Curt vanish
 

MANDY

(voice-over)
When it all 
came crashing down, I just stood on the sidelines and watched, just like 
everybody else.
 
CUT TO:
 
INT. BRIAN’S OFFICE – DAY – 1974
 
Curtain parts, revealing Curt below 
on the street.
 
He looks up and sees Brian.
 
EXT. BIJOU OFFICE – DAY – 1974
 
Brian looks through the window then 
withdraws. Curt gets into the limo and takes off.
 
INT. BRIAN’S OFFICE – DAY – 1974
 
A phone receiver is lifted up. 
CLOSE ON Brian’s finger dialling a number.
 
INT. LIMO – MOMENTS LATER – DAY – 1974
 
The streets of London passing from a 
car.
Signs for Heathrow Airport approach.
 
Curt looks out. He squints from the 
sun.
Flashback to a time Brian and Curt 
shared together, on the beach. Perhaps when they went on the ‘much needed 
holiday’ and left Mandy.
 
            CUT TO:
 
INT. BRIAN’S OFFICE  - DAY – LATER – 
1974
 
CLOSE ON Brian’s tight mouth against 
a phone receiver.
 

BRIAN
Out. O-U-T.
 
            CUT TO:
 
INT. BIJOU OFFICES – DEVINE’S OFFICE – 
DAY – 1974
 
CLOSE ON Devine’s nose, the phone 
against his face. Speedy ZOOM OUT.
 

DEVINE
Well, Brian. 
I’m afraid that is completely out of the question. You are contractually bound 
to finish the Maxwell Demon tour as Maxwell Demon –
 
Mandy stands at the door of his 
office holding a stack of papers. CLOSE ON 
Devine.
 

BRIAN

(off-screen; faintly through receiver)
Jerry, I’m 
telling you, is just getting far too out of hand – I really don’t think I’ll be 
able to – 
 

DEVINE

(looking at Mandy)
Brian –Brian 
– I realize you’re under tremendous strain, but you’ve jut gotta hang on in 
there and finish...
 
Mandy slowly turns to go.
 
- the bloody 
tour. You hang on in there. I’ll hang on here.
 
            CUT TO:
 
INT. BRIAN’S OFFICE – DAY
 
Brian is in total distress. He is not 
paying attention to what Devine is saying.
 

DEVINE

(off screen)
And then you 
can do what you want, OK?
 
            CUT TO:
 
EXT. STREETS OF KREUZBERG – BERLIN – 
NIGHT – 1974
 
Curt walks through an industrial 
neighbourhood in West Berlin. He lights a cigarette as an elevated train passes 
in the distance, blinking red and green. Suddenly he looks up, spotting 
something on the street.
 
An individual looking remarkably like 
Brian, dressed as Maxwell Demon, stands with two other flashly dressed 
individuals.
 
Curt squints at the spectre, taking a 
few vague steps in the direction.
 
The figure turns, revealing himself 
to be a teenage fan.
 
Curt, 
CLOSE, spooked by the misrecognition.
 
            CUT TO:
 
Shots of the people: men in trench 
coats, teenagers sitting on the stairs of Piccadilly fountain, Japanese 
tourists.
 
Arthur sees a group of Glam Girls 
stumble into a dark club. He follows.
 
            CUT TO:
 
INT. LAST RESORT CLUB – NIGHT – 1973
 
In a cramped London club, Malcolm, 
Ray, Pearl and Billy of The Flaming Creatures (a cross between Roxy Music and 
The New York Dolls) perform the current section of ‘Bittersweet’ with raucous 
intensity.
 
Arthur watches. He likes what he 
hears.
 
Ray spots him and blows him a trampy 
kiss.
 
Arthur blushes.
 
            CUT TO:
 
EXT. BRIAN SLADE PROTESTS – LONDON – DAY 
– 1974 VIDEO NEWSREELS
 
CLOSE ON grainy shot of a Brian Slade 
poster in flames over the song’s tender finish.
 
We see albums being burned and thrown 
into a charred pile. Others burn songbooks, magazines, forty-fives.
 
INT. BIJOU OFFICES – DAY – 1974
 
Brian’s face, starring at the 
monitor, a ghost of his former self.
 
CLOSE ON his hand rewinding the tape.
 
DISSOLVE TO:
 
EXT. KREUZBERG – BERLIN – NIGHT – 1974

 
Curt has inadvertently joined a 
hustler/cruising strip, full of young specimens on the street corners and 
pulled-over cars. As Curt walks he notices one car beginning to follow.
 
He smiles to himself, thinking it’s a 
proposition, and turns the next corner.
 
The car does the same.
 
As Curt crosses the street, he slows, 
trying to get a look at the driver.
 
Tentatively he approaches it, 
spooked.
 
CLOSE ON a car window rolling down 
and revealing Jack Fairy.
 
            CUT TO:
 
INT. LAST RESORT CLUB – LATER – 1973
 
TRACK through the slowed-down remains 
of the club, most of the clientele subdued with drink. Off-screen, The Flaming 
Creatures’ late-night banter is heard:
 

MALCOLM
I don’t 
believe that there is much of a future to speak of –
 

PEARL
We’re in a 
bit of a decadent spiral, aren’t we?
 
We pass one half-undressed Weimar 
Woman, evoking thirties Berlin, spread across the tables.
 

BILLY
Sinking fast.
 

RAY
Big Brother, 
baby. All the way.
 
Reveal Arthur and the Creatures 
sprawled around a table teaming with empty pints.
 
Quick 
SINGLES on each of them:
 

MALCOLM
Which is why 
we prefer impressions to ideas – 
 

PEARL
Brief flights 
to sustained ones –
 

RAY
Exceptions to 
types –
 

BILLY
Situations to 
subjects –


PEARL
And yourself?
 
Arthur looks at them a moment.
 

ARTHUR
Well I’m – 
I’m just looking for a room at the moment.
 
CUT TO:
 
INT. RECORDING STUDIO – LATER THAT NIGHT 
– 1974
 
We see Brian’s  singing 
‘Bittesweet’/Roxy Music.
Brian records his version of the song 
alone in the darkened studio. He returns to its tender refrain with eyes closed, 
heart clenched.
 
In the hallway Mandy moves through 
the shadows toward the studio, drawn by the music.
 
Inside a 
CLOSE TRACK curls around Brian, revealing a perfect tear 
glittering on his cheek.
 
            CUT TO:
 
INT. DIVE CLUB – NEW YORK – LATE DAY – 
1984
 
CLOSE ON Mandy.
 

MANDY
So for one 
entire day I actually think Brian’s been shot. That the whole thing is real, all 
his paranoias proven horribly true – 
 

ARTHUR
You mean – no 
one told you –
 

MANDY
Nope.
 

ARTHUR
Why?
 

MANDY
Forgot.
 

ARTHUR
Jesus.
 

MANDY
I mean...I 
knew it was over. I just didn’t know it was up to me to make it stop.
 
            FADE TO:
 
INT. BIJOU TOWN HOUSE ENTRANCE – DAY – 
1975
 
We follow Mandy along the hallway 
leading to the old offices.
 
At the end of the hall way, we reach 
the main door. Mandy pushes it open and enters.
 
INT. BIJOU OFFICES – DAY – 1975
 
Inside, the office’s musical comedy 
ambience has turned film noir: shadows engulf the cavernous space where desks 
are piled with boxes and chairs stacked, overturned or covered in sheets.
 
She walks through the deserted 
‘cubicles’, passing shady remnants of the past.
 
Against a far wall, the TV monitor is 
playing more silent footage from the Slade protests.
 
Mandy looks down.
 
There, in the far corner of the room 
on a large mattress sits Brian. Shirtless, he is snorting cocaine off the ass of 
a nude black girl (Coco), who is dead asleep. On a lone coffee table – the only 
other uncovered furniture in sight – a mountain of cocaine has spilled over paraphernalia 
and hundred-dollar bills.
 

BRIAN

(weak)
Mandy.
 

MANDY
Hello, Brian.
 
Brian just stares for a few 
dumbfounded seconds before offering her the straw.
 

MANDY

(barely maintaining)
No, thanks.
 
Mandy stares at him, almost smiling.
Slow 
TRACK IN begins as she shuffles through her belongings. She produces a folder 
and holds it out to him.
 
She remains frozen, arm outstretched.
 
These are the 
papers. I believe they’re in order. All you need to do is sign.
 
Brian watches as she turns and walks 
across the room to the coffee table.
 
Mandy sticks the folder into the pile 
of coke.
 
So you won’t 
forget.
 
Brian stares, his face suddenly open 
like a child’s.
 

BRIAN
I already 
have.
 
Coco squirms in her sleep, tightening 
her grip around Brian.
 

MANDY
Evidently!
 
With that, Mandy turns and starts out 
the door. Then all at once she stops and turns to face him.
 
Fuck 
you, Brian! Did you ever – for one bloody second in your life want 
anything more –

(suddenly quiet)
-than 
this?
 
Brief pause.
 

BRIAN

(suddenly lucid)
No.
 
Mandy looks at him, her eyes filling, 
with a sad smile.
 

MANDY

(softly)
Your problem 
is: ‘You get what you want and do what you will.’
 

BRIAN

(matching her in a sudden game of quotation)
‘Worlds,’ 
Mandy, ‘are built out of suffering. There is suffering at the birth of a child 
as at the birth of a star.’
 

MANDY
‘You live in 
terror of not being misunderstood.’
 

BRIAN
‘Women defend 
themselves by attacking, just as they attack by sudden and strange surrenders.’
 
CLOSE ON Mandy, her eyes moist.
 

MANDY

(more to herself)
‘I lost my 
girlhood, true. But it was for you.’
 
Suddenly a rear door bangs open, 
startling Mandy and waking Coco.
 
Shannon stands at the doorway, 
staring at Mandy. Now Brian’s personal secretary, Shannon’s force has grown 
considerably. Coco opens her eyes and lifts her head.
 

SHANNON

(professionally irate)
What in God’s 
name is going on up here? How the fuck did you get up here? Brian, I’m really 
sorry about that.
 

BRIAN
It’s alright, 
Shannon. Mandy was just leaving.
 

SHANNON
Mandy, if 
you’d be so kind as to follow me – 
 
Shannon takes Mandy firmly in hand 
and Mandy recoils, furiously.
 

MANDY
Let go of me. 
I’m perfectly capable of making my own –
 
Mandy goes to leave through a locked 
door.
 

SHANNON
I really 
don’t want to have to call someone – 
 
Brian giggles.
 

MANDY
Call 
someone? I’m his wife, for fuck’s sake!
 
Brian start’s laughing loudly and 
obnoxiously.
 
Mandy’s eyes fill with tears. 
Enraged, she turns and sweeps the pile of cocaine into the air.
 
Fuck the lot 
of you!
 
Briefly 
SLOW MOTION: Brian, laughing through the white cloud, divorce papers  and 
money that Mandy has just sent sailing through the air.

ARTHUR

(off-screen)
Was that the 
last time you saw him?
 
A distant trace of music begins as 
Arthur looks up from his notes. A slow TRACK IN 
begins.
 
Mandy stands, passing Arthur on her 
way to the bar.
 
No, but it 
was the last time we actually ah...spoke. 
I saw him 
again – briefly – a few weeks later. At a concert.
 

ARTHUR
He was 
performing?
 
TRACE IN behind Mandy as the 
cigarette machine.
 

MANDY
No. Curt was 
actually performing. He and Jack Fairy had just finished their Berlin record and 
Curt was in London playing some gigs. And Brian was there – for a second. I 
don’t think anyone even saw him.
 
Music and 
TRACK coverage as Mandy pushes the button. Her cigarettes 
drop.

CLOSE ON Arthur.
 

ARTHUR
Which 
concert?
 
Mandy turns to him
 
            SUDDEN CUT TO:
 
INT. RAINBOW THEATRE – LONDON – NIGHT – 
1975
 
An ominous crash of Organ announces 
the majesty of the old hall; red velvet curtains curling up beneath its opulent 
proscenium, framing the stage like a golden crown.
 
INT. DIVE CLUB – NEW YORK – LATE DAY – 
1984
 

MANDY
It was like a 
tribute- sort of a farewell concert to glam rock.
 
INT. RAINBOW THEATRE – NIGHT- 1975
 
On-stage, through the final 
projections of glam icons, the silhouette of a looming coffin is revealed 
against deep purple lights with its lid slowly opening. A beam of golden light 
rises from the coffin, illuminating a slow cascade of glitter.
 
The scrim is lifted just as a caped 
figure emerges, waling into opal light. It’s Jack Fairy, looking as tall and 
radiant as ever.
 
Jack resumes begins narration over a 
rousing applause.
 

JACK
To save your 
wild, wild lives
To ne’er your 
fans embitter
To cease your 
sad demise tonight
We toast –

 
SWOOPING IN on Arthur, his face amid 
the sea of spectators. There’s a panic in his eyes.
 
            FAST RETURN:
 
INT. RAINBOW THEATRE – ON STAGE – NIGHT 
– 9175
 
Music peaks as an enormous banner 
unfurls like a flame. Its gilded script reads: THE 
DEATH OF GLITTER SHOW!
 
A rockin’ Flaming Creature’s song 
(‘20th Century Boy’/T-Rex) begins.        
 
INT. CREATURES’ FLAT – NIGHT- 1975
 
Teenage Arthur, 
CLOSE in the mirror, is making himself up as Maxwell Demon.
 
The table is strewn with a mess of 
make-up and magic mushrooms.
The room is filled with pre concert 
excitement and banter as they all get ready.
 

ARTHUR
Is this 
working? Cos I want it blue-er.
I don’t think 
you should bother I think I should go on stage tonight, instead of you.
 

FLAMING CREATURE

Fast 
ZOOM OUT from Arthur, dancing wildly in the wings.
 
In the wings a Roadie puts his hand 
on Arthur’s shoulder to settle him down.
 
Arthur turns, embarrassed. He catches 
sight of:
 
Three people approaching from 
backstage: a Musician, a Hip Woman with a clipboard – and Curt Wild. 
ZOOM IN.
 
Arthur stares in disbelief.
 
We hear:
 

ADULT ARTHUR

Yeah, I’m 
trying to reach Curt Wild. I’m a journalist from the Herald.
 
Swirling music over.

given this number, I was told I could reach Curt Wild, ah, here.
 
INT. OFFICE – NEW YORK – LATE DAY – 1984
 
MATCH TRACK around the back of Curt’s 
head, on the phone to Arthur. He sits at the desk of a small, ratty office.
 

CURT
Listen... (muttering 
in background to someone else) 
 

ARTHUR
Yeah? 
...Hello? Hello!?
 

CURT
Listen, I 
don’t know who the hell gave you this number – but Curt Wild is not available 
and not interested in granting you or anyone else an interview on this subject – 
you got it?
 

ARTHUR
I’m sorry – I 
was told –
 
Curt slams down the phone. He looks 
over to two suits with Government insignias sitting opposite on a tattered 
couch.
 
‘Dead Finks Don’t Talk’/Brian Eno

            CUT TO:
 
INT. ARTHUR’S APARTMENT – NEW YORK – 
LATE AFTERNOON – 1984
 
CLOSE UP Arthur, standing and looking 
in the mirror of his apartment. For a few beats he is still. Then, suddenly, we 
hear the clatter of electronics. Arthur turns.
 
ZOOM IN to his desk where he is 
receiving a telex (fax).
 
HIGH ANGLE: Arthur walks across the 
room to his desk. His apartment is a crooked, looming container, twice as tall 
as it is wide. Its few bunker-style windows are strangely high.
 
EXTREME CLOSE-UP: telex
 
It reads:

‘NAME CHANGE SEARCH: BRIAN SLADE – REQUEST DENIED’
 
Arthur pulls out the chair to his 
desk.

Computer screen. Words flash by:

‘FILE REQUEST FOR NAME CHANGE SEARCH:

real name and birthplace appear:
 
BRIAN SLADE, born: Thomas Brian 
Stoningham Slade, 2 January 1948, in Birmingham, Great Britain.
 
Name change:  16 March 1971 [Brian 
Slade],

 23 January 1979 [ACCESS

...Due to the 
overwhelming demand, additional shows are being added whenever and wherever 
possible.
 
TRACK IN to Arthur who is stuck, 
watching.
Suddenly he races back to his 
computer.
 
On computer screen, 
CLOSE UP across Slade’s birth-name:

THOMAS BRIAN PATRICE STONIGNHAM SLADE.
 
TRACK INTO the names ‘THOMAS ... 
STONINGHAM’
 
Arthur stares at the screen.
 
He looks back at the TV set. 
FAST PAN/ZOOM INTO TV screen.

INT. NEWS ROOM CORRIDOR – NIGHT – 1984
 
Arthur races down the shadow hallway 
to Lou’s office. He knocks.

 

ARTHUR
Lou? Lou?
 
He opens the door. It’s dark inside. 
He hears a sound and looks back to the elevators.
 
The doors are opening and Lou is 
getting in.
 
Lou!
 
Arthur goes running down the hall.
 
Lou! LOU!
 

LOU
I’m sorry, 
Arthur. I’m late.
 

ARTHUR
Lou ! I think 
I’m on to something.
 
Lou presses a button and the doors 
open.
 

LOU
What?
 

ARTHUR
Something 
quite big. I think I know who Brian Slade is.
 

LOU
That story’s 
been dropped.
 

ARTHUR
What? Why?
 
The elevator doors are closing.
 

LOU
I need you on 
the Stone show.
 

ARTHUR
But that’s 
it–
 
The doors close.
 

ARTHUR
What did they 
say to you? Lou!
 
A slow build of music begins.
 
            RETURN TO:
 
EXT. NEW YORK STREET – LATE DAY – 1984
 
Arthur stares at a poster of Tommy 
Stone on a bus stop.
 
CLOSE ON Arthur, staring sadly. 
Cheerless music begins rising ‘Gimme Danger’/Iggy and the Stooges.
 
Music builds as we follow Arthur in 
CLOSE UP, fighting back memories. Finally, he shuts his eyes.
 
            DISSOLVE TO:
 
INT. RAINBOW THEATRE – ON STAGE – NIGHT 
– 1975
 
Dark, golden glimpses of a sinewy 
body, moving to the music.  The music heard is Curt performing his last song to 
Brian, a mournful plea for submission. He is dressed only in tight fitting, 
silver pants and throughout the song he cowers and crawls:
 
CLOSE TRACK in to Arthur, watching 
from the wings, surrounded by The Creatures.
 
Curt sings with tender, ominous 
restraint, letting loose only at the end.
 
Mandy, also watches, by herself, from 
the wings.
 
On-stage Curt sings with seething 
intensity.
 
When the song finally erupts into a 
swarm of guitars, Curt breaks into desperate thrashes across the stage.
 
In the wings Arthur sneaks another 
glance at:
 
Mandy, watching Curt with a furrowed 
brow. Suddenly she turns and looks out to the rear of the auditorium.
 
Arthur follows her gaze.
 
From the back of the house a figure 
steps into view, silhouetted against the light of an exit door.
 
Arthur squints to make it out.
 
CLOSE, we see that it’s Brian.
 
On-stage Curt’s thrashing continues. 
Curt claws at himself and thrashes with desperate emotion, feeling and re-living 
his pain. The song reaches a peak as the deep blue lights slowly fade to black. 
Finally he huddles/collapses face down on stage. There is a split second of 
silence before the crowd explodes.
 
CLOSE ON Brian, who slips away.
 
            CUT:
 
INT. RAINBOW THEATRE – BACKSTAGE - 
MOMENTS LATER – 1975
 
In relative darkness, the Roadie is 
clearing a path for the band to exit the stage, cornering Arthur. Dark, wet 
bodies crash past.
 
As Curt comes darting by, Mandy 
suddenly bolts past the Roadie and grabs him.
 
CLOSE ON Arthur, cornered by their 
hug. He hears:
 

MANDY
That was 
really beautiful
 

CURT
Yeah? Thanks.
 
Houselights come up and Mandy and 
Curt disengage, speaking quietly to one another.
 
Arthur looks down, trying to listen 
inconspicuously.
 

(quietly)
Did you...?
 

MANDY

(also quietly)
No I didn’t 
see him.
 
Then she turns, catching sight of 
Arthur.
 
Curt looks up as well.
 
Arthur stands caught, a doe-eyed 
Maxwell Demon.
 
For a moment, Curt is taken aback by 
Arthur’s youthful homage.
 
 

ARTHUR

(voice-over)
It’s only 
now, looking back, that I see –
 
            DISSOLVE TO:
 
INT. RAINBOW THEATRE – LOBBY – NIGHT – 
1975
 
SLOW MOTION TRACK in to Curt, 
surrounded by colourful figures and painted faces at a packed, post-show 
reception. Everyone is laughing, drinking and grabbing one another, but the 
colours have faded, the glitter worn, and a dark, Berlin-style decadence has set 
in. TRACK ends as Curt looks up, spotting someone from across the room.
 
MATCH TRACK in to Arthur, squeezed 
into the corner of the lobby, trapped by Curt’s glance.
 

ARTHUR

(voice-over)
-how you 
patched through my walls and entered my life...in waves.
 
Arthur looks down shyly and back up 
again.
 
Curt’s eyes are fixed.
 
            FAST DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. RAINBOW THEATRE ROOF – 4 A.M. – 1975
 
CLOSE BACK-TRACK with Arthur as he 
walks across the dark rooftop. Shadows pass over his face like a ghost.
 
The music yields to Curt’s deep, 
internal whisper.
 

CURT

(voice-over; slow, thoughtful)
Come closer. 
Don’t be frightened. What’s your name? Your favourite colour? Song. Movie. Don’t 
be nervous. Are you high?
 
Arthur whispers his response aloud, 
half to himself:
 

ARTHUR
I’m on a 
button.
 
FAST DISSOLVE TO EARLIER:
 
EXT. RAINBOW THEATRE – ROOF – EARLIER – 
1975
 
Wide 
TRACK IN on Curt, who sits at the far end of the roof watching our 
approach (Arthur’s POV during his previous walk).
 
A voice returns but it’s Adult Arthur 
we hear:
 

ADULT ARTHUR

(voice-over)
He was 
waiting for me. I’d followed his signals and slipped away and now – 
suddenly –
 
            FAST DISSOLVE TO:
 
EXT. RAINBOW THEATRE – ROOFTOP – LATER – 
1975
 
Curt bursts up laughing, opening a 
can of beer that sprays all over himself. He sits with Arthur at the far corner 
of the roof, blushing with giggles.
 
CLOSE ON Arthur’s face, speckled with 
beer. Curt looks up.
 

CURT
Hey –
 
Arthur follows, just catching sight 
of:
A falling star.
 
ZOOM IN ON 
CURT:
 
Make a wish.
 
            CUT TO:
 
EXT. RAINBOW THEATRE – ROOF – LATER – 
1975
 
Music continues as we follow Curt’s 
hand as it travels to Arthur and lands tenderly on his cheek.
 
Arthur is pulling off his shirt, 
standing over Curt who is also shirtless.
 
            FAST DISSOLVE:
 
EXT. RAINBOW THEATRE – ROOF – LATER – 
1975
 
EXTREME CLOSE-UP of Curt’s hand on 
Arthur’s bare back, his cool white skin filling the screen. We follow it down.
 
FAST CUT TO:
 
EXT. RAINBOW THEATRE – ROOF – MORNING – 
1975
 
Curt laughing as someone (Arthur) 
watches him pee.
 
            FAST RETURN TO:
 
EXT. RAINBOW THEATRE – ROOF – NIGHT – 
1975
 
In sweaty 
CLOSE-UP, Curt sees something in the sky.
 

CURT
Hey –
 
Arthur’s eye darts up. He sees:
 
A luminous spacecraft, like the one 
that passed over Old Dublin. It swirls over London with a thunderous boom – and vanishes.
 
All that remains is a sky full of 
glitterdust.
 
CLOSE ON Curt’s lips, whispering 
through the cascade.
  
A WIDE SHOT of the roof, now awash in 
stardust, as the white bodies of Curt and Arthur are seen through the sparkles; 
Curt behind Arthur, gently fucking. A long, slow CRANE Out begins, as music and 
voices peak.
 
And see 
yourself, on-stage, inside-out. A tangle of garlands in your hair. Of course you 
were pleasantly surprised.
 

TEEN ARTHUR

(voice-over)
Softly, he 
said...
 

ALL THREE VOICES

(whispering- Curt, Teen/Adult Arthur)
I will mangle 
your mind.
 
We withdraw as the bodies of Curt and 
Arthur are engulfed and the artificiality of the set intensifies, warping 
perspective in the style of Caligari.
 
INT. STAGE – GRAND BALLROOM SET – NIGHT
 
The 
TRACK continues, revealing the bombed-out remains of a grand ballroom, and 
Brian, turning to the camera, dressed as a bejewelled Maxwell Demon. He begins 
to sing (‘Tumbling Down’/Steve Harley Cockney Rebel), slowly descending a 
gnarled staircase as we PULL OUT.
 
He stops at a half-blown landing just 
as a tattered chandelier is raised into frame. He mounts the shimmering beast, 
and finds a wreath of flowers around its cable. As he ascends, he throws flowers 
out to the ‘audience’ below.
Maxwell Demon, is gone.
 
            
FAST CUT TO:
 
INT. STADIUM SHOW – NEW YORK – NIGHT – 
1984
 
CLOSE ON Arthur’s closed eyes, 
imagining the previous Maxwell Demon show.
Arthur is in the audience of a Tommy 
Stone concert, applauding, coming out of his reverie.
 
Briefly:
 
INT. STADIUM SHOW – ON-STAGE _ NIGHT – 
1984
 
We see the actual Show: Tommy Stone 
in glitzy white garb, arms open, receiving applause and bouquets of flowers.
 
            CUT TO:
 
EXT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN – NIGHT – 
1984
 
Arthur walks out of the theatre to 
‘Dead Finks Don’t Talk’/Brian Eno. Fans are rushing past. Up ahead, a small 
crowd has gathered around the stage door.
 
There are cheers as Tommy Stone 
appears.
 
A huge spotlight is turned on to the 
door.
 
Arthur stops and watches.
 

REPORTERS
Tommy! Tommy! 
Where did you get the idea for such a spectacular stadium show?
 

TOMMY
Tell you the 
truth – it’s a bloody pain in the ass! The whole thing takes six full size rigs 
or three chartered planes to transport. What can I say? I think big!
 
Arthur approaches the crowd.
 

REPORTERS
Tommy! What’s 
your opinion on the work of President Reynolds has been doing-
 

TOMMY
Excellent. 
Excellent. I think he’s doing brilliant work. He’s a – tremendous leader, a 
tremendous spokesperson for the needs of the nation today –
 
Suddenly Arthur yells out over the 
others:
 

ARTHUR
Tommy! What 
is your response to the recent allegations connecting you to bisexual pop singer 
Brian Slade, who staged his own assassination ten years ago this week in London?
 
Tommy is white.
 
Reporters swarm as Arthur watches.
 
Tommy, devoured by Security Men, 
whisked away. Shannon is suddenly at the mike.
 

SHANNON
I’m sorry, 
ladies and gentlemen, that’s all the questions Mr Stone has time for this 
evening. Thank you very much – 
 
Arthur, still behind the chaos of 
Reporters.
 
CUT TO:
 
INT. TOMMY’S DRESSING ROOM – NEW YORK – 
NIGHT – 1984
 
Music as we follow Shannon and 
various Assistants escorting Tommy back to his dressing room.
 
In the background TV news is heard:
 

TV
Tonight, the 
Tri-State Area pulls out all the stops in welcoming pop superstar Tommy Stone to 
Madison Square Garden. Stone is promoting his Grammy-winning release, ‘People 
Rockin’ People’, to sold-out arenas worldwide...
 
Tommy is silent then in the midst of 
a cool panic.
 

SHANNON

(to everyone in the room, but Brian)
Get Out! Now! 
Shut the door!
 
CLOSE ON Shannon, eyes shut, as 
people clear. When the door closes we hear a squeal like Little Richard’s coming 
from the TV.
 
Tommy looks over.
 
TV SCREEN
 
The news broadcast of the Tommy Stone 
concert cuts to a clip. Suddenly Tommy Stone in white tuxedo turns to camera: 
the younger ‘Brian Slade’ dressed as stone turns back, glaring almost 
sinisterly, taunting him through the airwaves.
 
MATCH TRACK into Tommy, looking 
precisely as if he’s seen a ghost.
 
Rising music suddenly ends:
 
            CUT TO:
 
INT. MIDTOWN BAR – NEW YORK – NIGHT – 
1984
 
The door shuts behind Arthur in a 
dark mid-town bar.
 
Everyone looks up. There is a strange 
between-songs silence.
 
Arthur proceeds, self consciously.
 
A Tommy Stone song beings on the 
jukebox. (‘People Rockin’ People’/Shudder To Think) but people in the bar 
continue staring at Arthur.
 
He approaches the bar.
 

ARTHUR
Beer, please.
 
Arthur notices a group of mostly 
black Teenagers, decked out in Tommy Stone gear. They whisper to each other. One 
Teenage Girl starts walking over.
 
The Bartender hands Arthur his beer, 
staring all the while at Arthur’s jacket.
 
Arthur realizes he’s still wearing 
his press pass and starts taking it off.
 

TEENAGE GIRL
Excuse me, 
sir. Are you with the Tommy Stone Tour?
 

ARTHUR
No. I’m just 
a journalist. Perhaps you’d like my press pass as a souvenir?
 
Her eyes widen. Arthur hands her the 
pass.
 

TEENAGE GIRL
Thanks, 
Mister.
 
She squeals and runs back to show her 
friends as Arthur turns and walks deeper into the long, narrow bar.
 
He passes the jukebox, and discovers 
a second bar in the back: smaller and moodier. A man in a leather jacket is 
drinking along.
 
Arthur stops. He can’t believe his 
eyes.
 
It’s Curt Wild, folding a Tommy Stone 
guest pass into origami.
 
Arthur smiles and starts advancing 
before even deciding to.
 
Curt looks up. He just glares.
 

ARTHUR
You’re Curt 
Wild.
 

CURT

(irritable)
Yeah? Who the 
hell are you?
 
Brief silence.
 

ARTHUR
I’m a 
journalist. From the Herald. You were at the concert?
 
Curt just stares at him.
 
It’s just 
funny because...well, I was just trying to contact you actually. For a story I 
was doing –
 
Curt has now turned away.
 
-about an old 
friend of yours? Brian Slade?
 
Curt looks up for a moment, hiding 
his interest.
 
Was trying to 
find out...what actually happened to him.
 

CURT
Look –
 

ARTHUR
I mean, 
before he became –
 
Curt stops.
 
Tight on Arthur, peeking up at him.
 
-such a 
mystery.
 
Curt snorts out a sudden guffaw.
 

CURT
Look, man, I 
don’t know who you’ve been talking to or what you’re after here, but...

(trails off)
 

ARTHUR
What?
 
Curt looks away again..
 
What?
 

CURT
Listen – a 
real artist creates beautiful things and...puts nothing of his won life into 
them. Okay?
 

ARTHUR
Is that what 
you did?
 

CURT
No.

(brief silence)
We set out to 
change the world and ended up...just changing ourselves.
 

ARTHUR
What’s wrong 
with that?
 

CURT
Nothing.

(silence)
If you don’t 
look at the world.
 
Quiet music under slow 
PAN past kids gathered at the jukebox, cliques of Tommy Stone fans, 
conservative, bored. One gay Latino Boy sits braiding a girls hair. End on a 
huge Tommy Stone poster.
 

(off-screen)
Well, I guess 
in the end he got what he wanted.
 
Curt stands in though another beat 
before slipping on his jacket and downing his beer.
 
CLOSE ON Arthur looking up at him 
with a distant smile.
 

ARTHUR
That’s quite 
a – pin you got there.
 
CLOSE ON Curt’s jacket: the antique 
emerald pin sparkles green.
 

CURT
Oh yeah.
 

ARTHUR
Is it old?
 

CURT

(examining it)
Possibly. It 
belonged to Oscar Wilde. Or so I was told by the person who gave it to me.
 
Arthur’s eyes flash up. The shimmer 
swells. 
 
This friend 
of mine who kinda...disappeared...some years back.

 
Extreme 
CLOSE-UP of Curt.

(very far-away)
I forget 
where we were. On a trip. But he says to me, ‘Curt...
 
            FLASH TO:
EXT. BEACH – DAY – 1973
 
A bleached-out image of Brian and 
Curt on some beach.
 
From a great distance, Brian is 
pinning something on Curt’s shirt.
 

CURT

(voice-over)
...A man’s 
life is his image.’
 
            CUT TO:
 
Brief silent shots:
 
EXT. RAINBOW THEATRE – ROOF – MORNING – 
1975
 
Urine streaming in a puddle.
 
CLOSE ON Teenage Arthur watching Curt 
from behind. The remains of his Maxwell Demon make-up sully his face.
 
Curt, standing peeing, turns.
 
            BACK TO:
 
INT. MID-TOWN BAR – NEW YORK – NIGHT – 
1984
 
The emerald pin, rolling loose in the 
palm of Curt’s hand.
 

CURT
Here. Why 
don’t you hang on to it?
 
FLASH UP to Arthur’s face.
 

ARTHUR
Me?
 

CURT
Why not? I’ve 
had it too long anyway. Go ahead.
 
Curt puts it in Arthur’s hand. Arthur 
looks down at it, speechless.
 

(tenderly)
For your 
image.
 
Curt stands up, getting ready to go.
 
Arthur looks up at him, shaking his 
head.
 
Briefly: coins are pushed through 
slots, jukebox buttons pressed.
 

ARTHUR
Really. I 
couldn’t. But thanks.
 
Arthur returns the pin with a polite 
smile.
 
Briefly: a jukebox forty-five drops 
into place.
 
Curt takes the pin, pockets it.
 
The introduction to ‘2HB’/Roxy Music 
begins on the jukebox.
 
BACK TO Arthur, CLOSE, who 
turns toward the jukebox.
The gay Latino Boy Teen recognizes 
the song.
 

LATINO BOY
Oh God, I 
love this song. Do you know this song?
 

GIRL
I don’t think 
so.
 
Arthur turns back to Curt.
 

CURT
Anyway.
 

ARTHUR
Yeah.
 

CURT
See ya 
around.
 

ARTHUR
Cheers.
 
Curt nods with a strange smile and 
turns. Arthur watches him go. He reaches for his beer and finishes it off – and 
nearly gags. He spits something out in his hand.
 
CLOSE ON the palm of his hand: the 
emerald pin lies covered in beer spittle.
 
Arthur smiles, looking up in Curt’s 
direction.
 
EXTREME CLOSE-UP of Arthur.
 

ARTHUR

(voice-over)
He called it 
freedom.
 
Briefly: Silent shots.
 
EXT. RAINBOW THEATRE – ROOF – MORNING – 
1975
 
Curt, turning to camera while taking 
a piss (as before) Arthur, stretched out on the mattress, laughs.
 
            RETURN TO:
 
INT. MID-TOWN BAR – NEW YORK – NIGHT – 
1984
 
Slow 
EXTREME CLOSE UP around Arthur’s face, starring into the past.
 

ARTHUR

(voice-over)
A freedom you 
can allow yourself.
 
Arthur glances into the main bar.
 
Or not.
 
The first 
verse begins (sung by Jack Fairy), as Arthur closes the pin in his hand.
 

JACK

(singing)
Oh, I was 
moved by a screen dream...
 
            DISSOLVE TO:
 
INT. RAINBOW THEATRE – NIGHT – 1975
 
Jack Fairy performs the glam-rock 
anthem with regal pathos, at the Death of Glitter Show.
 
Jack stands  at the edge of the stage 
under a single spot.
 
Arthur stands crushed in a corner, 
swaying to the music with Ray, Pearl and Billy.
 
Slow 
TRACK IN on Mandy, watching from the wings.
 
We ascend, rising up from the stage, 
as a mist of glitter begins to fall. We pass the faces of glitter legends, 
projected onstage: Maxwell, Brian, Curt, Jack, Polly. We continue, rising into 
the darkness.
 
            DISSOLVE TO:
 
EXT. RAINBOW THEATRE – ROOF – DAWN – 
1975
 
We pass through to the roof where it 
is dawn and snowing. Curt and Arthur are there, hanging out after sex. They turn 
in our direction but we continue our ascent.

 
            DISSOLVE THROUGH:

A series of shots:
 
EXT. LONDON STREETS – DAY – 1974
 
Shots of busy Londoners on their way 
to work.
 
MONTAGE OF FACES (FROM BEGINNING)
 
The three Young Punks, singing along 
to the chorus.
 
Two London Girls, arm in arm, 
singing.
 
The faces of New York Street Kids, 
looking up, some sadly, some angrily.
 
Boy with Crew Cut, eyes closed sings 
a held note to the skies
 
LONDON PUB – NIGHT – 1974
 
The song’s chorus continues through a 
small transistor radio from which we TRACK, 
revealing a candle-lit pub during the 1974 miners’ strikes.
 
TRACK past the warm, flickering faces 
of Patrons, pints in hand, gazing solemnly toward the music.
 
HARD CUT TO BLACK:
‘Make Me Smile’/Steve Harley Cockney 
Rebel over closing credits.
 
 
 
 BACK 
TO MOULIN GOLDMINE!
