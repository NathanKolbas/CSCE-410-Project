PULL BACK to reveal he is a little man dressed in
period tails, he carries a stick and is singing to

an audience, Nanging above and behind him is a large
mirror approximately the size of a small movie screen.
It is tilted slightly downward and distorts the
reflection of the back of the i1.C., as well as the
faces of his audience.

Und sage wee

As the H.C. addresses his audience, we see that every
table has a telephone which connects to the other
tables, Each table prominently numbered so that the
customers can call one another, tease, flirt, make
assignations. The club, with all its tawdry and
p2rverse ambiance is patronized, however, by quite
respectabie middle-aged bourgeois. At the bar and at
one or two of the tables, we see more questionable
patrons ... two voung women dressed in men's clothes.
Caught in the moment of moving from the lesbians'
table to more conventional company is ELKD, a very
beautiful, but heavily made-up girl in a long lavendar
chiffon gown. She greets several customers, It is
obvious that ELKE is a KIT KAT KLUB employee. We

see her pass a SALVATION ARtIY GIPL who is going from
table to table, soliciting money. ELXE sniffs dis-
dainfully.

He crosses to the wings and helps pull on a rolling
platform upon which a sleazy ALL~GIRL S5-piece jazz
combo is playing a chorus of WILLKOMMEN.

Peering through a window as the train slows, coming

INT, TRAIN COMPARTMENT - DAY

BRIAN gathering up his coat and suitcase, ith him in
the compartment is another passenger, a small rather
prim man of about sixty. As the train pulis in, the
man carefully folds his newspaper. But not before

tia have had time to see the date, “March, 1931" on it.
The man stands up preparing to quit the train.

lle has trouble reaching overhead to bring doun a
package. Quickly BRIAN, trying to help, reaches up
and gets the package for the UAN, but as he does so,
the train gives a final lurch and BRIAN knocks against
the man. When they straighten up, BRIAN sces that he
has knocked the man's toupee badly awry. S5RIAN

speaks fluent German,

BRIAN
Oh, entschuldigen Sie oitte,.
I'm so sorry.
Erlauben Sie, mein Herr.

the package)

LUDWIG

As they pass each other, he raises his eyebrows
inquiringly. The SALVATION ARNY GIRL smiles gently,
shrugs ... "so-so" ,.. the shrug implies. The YODUG
NAZI takes heart and enters the club. Instantly he
is ushered out by the irate manager, viAK.

Understand?

The boy makes a bluffing gesture to strike back, but
the manager gives him a kick and the boy hurries off.
A SANDICH MAN wearing a placard advertising a rival
club, "Venus in Pelz" with a picture of a naked girl
wearing a fox fur around her neck, stands watching
MAX and the NAZI, The manager now aims a kick at the
SANDWICH aN.

Under the foregoing, we hear:

EXT. BERLIN STREET - DAY (liusic Under - lose it under
train noise)

Lower middle-class residential area. BRIAN, with
his suitcase in hand, stands on the doorstep of one
of a row of houses, Checks address, then rings bell.
There is a moment's wait. At the end of the street,
an overhead train passes by. The noise is plainiy
discernable at this distance. While BRIAN is consid-
ering this, the door opens.

Standing in it is a very young girl with a shiny clean
face, but wearing a soiled old kimono which she
clutches with rather grubby little-girl hands, the
fingernails. of which are painted bright green. The
girl is SALLY BOULES.

SALLY
Ja?

/ BRIAN

Ah, guten tag, Fraulein. Ist

BRIAN cannot help

smiling)

BRIAN
You're American?

SALLY

You're English! How marvelous!

(notices his eyes

on her fingernails;

wiggles her fingers)
Divinely decadent! Come in.
Fraulein Schneider isn't here at

poor old liebling out shopping ...

BRIAN moves past her into the house. SALLY closes
the door after him.

INT, FRAULEIN SCHNEIDER'S ROOMING HOUSE - DAY

SALLY leads BRIAN from the hallway into a reception

BRIAN

quite formally)

SALLY
Have you a cigarette, Brian,
darling? I'm desperate.

Quickly, BRIAN produces a package. SALLY takes one
and from her kimono pocket brings forth a ridicu-
lously long cigarette holder. She smiles delightedly
at BRIAN,

Cabaret Girls!

The GIRLS enter, dancing. There are about six or
eight of them. Ail are rather grossly sexy showing

a lot of overripe flesh. Heavily made up, even by
cheap theatrical standards. Their costumes bring to
mind the filmy, inadequate covering of George Grosz's
women.

INT, SCHNEIDER'S RECEPTIO#I ROOLi - DAY (Music Under)

Arranged in a self-consciously sexy position on the
ratty old sofa, SALLY does her version of Theda
Bara with the cigarette holder. It is obvious that
BRIAN finds her deliciously foolish.

/ SALLY
Hy God, I've even begun to
think in German.

BRIAN

How long have you been here?
SALLY

Forever.
BRIAN

How long is that?

 
Page 8

SALLY
Almost three months.
(BRIA laughs)
What are you laugning at?

BRIAN
Nothing. Really.

utterly disarming)
Is there a room available here?

SALLY
There's a marvelous room.

Come on, T'1l show you ...
{at the door)
You'll adore it!

They move down the hall, turn a corner.

Very adroitly, she cracks another egg into the tooth-
brush glass from which she casually empties its
intended contents,

SALLY

It's an egg with Worcestershire
sauce all sort of wooshed up
together ... .

(She removes the

long cigarette holder

from her mouth and

uses that end of it

to ‘woosh' up the eggs !

watches the operation,

fascinated)
I simply live on them. They work
instantly on even the most sinister
hangover,

the glasses, Sus-

You see! It's like a suite.

in a Cabarct. And when I get
through there, I usually go out.
I mean, I may bring a man home
occasionally, but only occa=
Sionaliy, because I do think
one ought to go to the man's
rooms, if one can. I mean it
doesn't look so much as if
one expected it. So you see,
you can use this room prac-
tically all of the time.

BRIAN -
How old are you, Sally?

SALLY

I am rushing toward middle age
with outstretched arms! I
embrace the menopause!

Nineteen. But I've got ancient

to sing.

SALLY'S NUMBER
(Jew song to be
written for this
spot)

At the end of SALLY's number, we cut to table near
front, BRIAN sits there alone, applauding enthu-
siastically, delighted with SALLY.

CUT TO:

SALLY leaving the backstage area, gives a big smile
to a hulking young WiAN, This is KLAUS: stage-

firmly)

LONG SHOT of SALLY, quickly threading her way
through tables behind BRIAN, making certain he
doesn't see her. She stops at the table of a dark,
good-looking YOUNG ijAN, who rises quickly to greet
her. She smiles, sits down, speaks to him. We see
her pointing to BRIAN, who is now watching the
backstage curtain, in the hope of seeing SALLY.-

SALLY grins, picks up the telephone on the table,
speaks into the mouthpiece.

During the above, BRIAN's eye has been caught by
the exquisite ELKE; who sinuously glides from the
businessman's table to the NEM'S ROQii, which she
enters, LRiAil's eyes widen a bit. SALLY notices.

SALLY

Well, of course she is a boy ...
but she hates qoing €6 the Men's

like an oversized playpen containing some six inches
of viscous mud and two wonen wrestlers standing in
the mud. They wear satin tights, high-laced
classic wrestlers’ boots. ‘Their more than ample

It is very late. The streets are almost totally
deserted. BRIAN and SALLY are together, walking.
SALLY is still wearing her stage make-up. Over her
long dress, she wears a ratty old pony coat with a
fox collar.

The shop windows they pass are poor and dingy and
mostly dark. The only lighted one is a pawnshop.

BRIAN
I want to stay at least a year

BRIAN
Not a bit. No one ever shocks
me when they try to.

SALLY

Why do you say I'm trying to
shock you?

BRIAN
I have an idea you try and shock
evervone, I think you're actually
rather shy and it's just nerves.
If you claim to go to bed with
every man in Berlin, you still
won't convince me that you're

very good at goid-digging.

BRIAN

But you are.

SALLY
(righteously}
Well, at least I try.

Coming toward them, on’ the sidewalk, is a strange
motorized vehicle, three wheels, a seat and a steering
device, It is just large enough to hold the crippled
young man who propels it through the dark, steering
with one arm, the other, cuddling close to hin, a

very old dog wrapped against the night air in a blanket.
On the front of the vehicle, fly several small flags,
one a swastika,

As SALLY and BRIAW approach and pass this strange night
vision, they do not speak. When it is gone, they
resume their conversation.

BRIAN
Where are your parents, Sally?

SALLY

My mother's dead. Since I was
ten. Daddy's in the diplomatic
service. He's a terrible snob,
of course ...

(laughs).
Strong on appearance because he's
so short on money. One of those.
But, actuaily, we adore each other.
Of course, he'd absolutely pass
over if he knew what an old whore

BRIAN
How in the world did he ever

train rushes by above them, SALLY Opens her mouth and

BRIAN takes it, reads the title page, begins to leaf

LOTHAR

So, mes enfants, you are, like me,

(puts down his glass,

mekes a fastidious face)
The wine is blasphemous in this place
+e-we'll go to the Kempinsky...

SALLY
But, darling! I have to work.

LOTHAR smiles lazily. In this, as in all his subse-
quent excesses, we must never feel that he is showing
off or behaving in any way that is not natural and
habitual with him. He is @ispleased or restless,
ergo, he does something about it.

LOTHAR
Oh, I shall make an arrangement
with the management...

His expert eye instantly singles out MAX, to whom he
beckons. MAX, who still shows effects of earlier

beating, quickly starts to make his way toward their
table.

LOTHAR

Would that please you, my poor little

The Hall has great vaulted ceilings with beautiful

Painted white, Above and sucrounding a fireplace are
@ collection of matching gazelle horns, delicate and
beautiful, little golden spirals, The effect of the
castle's interior is an extremely sophisticated com-

eighteenth century chain... the rugs are eighteenth
Scutury French as are the chandeliers and colors.

The effect is one of great charm and lightness.

_There are occasional bizarre touches.,.at the bottom
of an open, winding staircase the banisters end in
two great carved, painted leopards, almost life-sized,

SALLY stands about eve to eye with one of them. She
regards the leopard; the leopara regards her.

BRIAN comes out of tha bathroom (also enormous), drying
his hands and face. He has sobered up somewhat. He
notices a round table covered with silver-framed photo-

in his World War I uniform...a pilot. He looks as
relaxed and at case beside his war plane as he does
today...just younger. BRIAN pays close attention to
the six crosses on the side of the plane...one for each
of six destroyed enemy planes.

LOTHAR pitches the sweater to BRIAN. Then leans
against the wall with folded arms, smiling. BRIAN

has little option but to peel off his shirt and put
on the sweater,

For some reason, taking off his shirt in front of
LOTHAR embarrasses BRIAN, and he is as quick about it
as he can be. LOTHAR only smiles, Although LOTHAR's
attitude toward SALLY is always overtly seductive...
WE know it, SALLY knows it, BRIAN knows it...there is
also something unspoken, more covert, but also plainly
seductive in his attitude toward BRIAN. WE know it,
BRIAN knows it. Only SALLY is blithely unaware. This
attitude never reveals itself in any word or gesture
that could possibly be defined as faggoty; it is simply
teasing, knowing, challenging. And although BRIAN is
far from unsophisticated, in this man's presence he
suddenly seems very young. And not a little nervous,

This is a large, sun-drenched conservatory in the
Regensburg Castle. We come up on a shot that shows

us, in sharp outline, a row of small-scale topiary
trees. (Topiary is the art of clipping certain shrubs,
usually box or yew, into ornamental or fantastic shapes.)
These pieces are tubbed and no taller than five feet.
They are in the unlikely shapes of various aircraft...
mono- and bi-planes, balloons, gliders, dirigibles.
These plants are extravagantly detailed, their stubborn,
green planthood ruthlessly cut and Clipped and sculp-
tured, One of the airplanes is tilted in an Immelman
turn...the balloons have little leafy green gas ejectors,
the dirigible...properly fat, its nose sharp, its di-
rectional controls thin and sharp....seems to sail four
feet off the floor,

Oh. My neck is all stiff...somebody

The 'somebody' is obviously meant to be LOTHAR, against
whom she is pressed, LOTHAR turns her about so that

he can get to the back of her neck. Tenderly, gently,
he massages.,,SALLY moans pleasurably. All the while,
LOTHAR smiles provocatively at BRIAN, baiting him some-
how. BRIAN does not react, LOTHAR bends over, kisses

from an enormous, roaring fireplace.

They have long since dined. BRIAN, once again more
than a little drunk, stands in a long window, con-
templating the night, a drink in his hand, He is
wearing the trousers and jacket in which he arrived.
BRIAN is restless and unhappy, but caught in some sort
of trap, from which he is unable, for the moment, to
extricate himself. He is angry with SALLY, but unable
to focus his disapproval because he is also frightened
of himself, He is strongly attracted to LOTHAR.

Why aren't you interested in my
childhood, Brian? Come...I'll
show you the ones on the bearskin
rug.

BRIAN gives a small, rather tight smile, does not move.
LOTHAR suddenly speaks to BRIAN, in rapid German.

LOTHAR

Come! Be a good fellow, You mustn't
make Sally unhappy.

BRIAN

rapid German)
How could I, when she has you to
make her happy?

you talk so fast.

With an exaggerated Latinesque bow, LOTHAR holds out
his arms to SALLY. Laughingly, she moves into them,
and they proceed to kiddingly perform the silly ro-
mantic attitudes of the dance. Idly, BRIAN drinks and
watches.

SALLY
Marvelous!

LOTHAR

as he dips SALLY al-
most to the floor)
Brian seems to be bored by simple
country life,

Not at all,

sation with BRIAN,

never missing a beat

of the dance)
No, no,...you are right. To be young
is to be restless.,.demanding...

(smiles charmingly

up at BRIAN)
So. Where would you like to go if
you could go anyplace in the world?

BRIAN doesn't bother to answer the question seriously

carved leopards, He smiles.

seriously. But SALLY gasps with delight.

LOTHAR

I sce that what pleases Brian,

all this with an attempt

at cynical detachment)
We'll take a boat from Genoa, sail
through the Suez Canal, and on to
Mombasa. Then there's a rather
interesting train overland to Nai-
robi...We'll have to get busy with
visas.

SALLY stares at LOTHAR as if he had suddenly turned
into the aurora borealis, LOTHAR, deeply gratified,
smiles back. And now, as BRIAN drinks and watches,
LOTHAR and SALLY become seriously caught up in their
dance, Both of them move with matched instinctive
grace. As they become more and more immersed in the
music and their own skill and physical propinquity,
they forget BRIAN. He is quickly aware of what is
happening between them. He downs the last of his
drink, and quietly leaves the room, SALLY and LOTHAR
de not notice his departure, as they dance on.

Suddenly, the door bursts open and SALLY enters. She
is very smart looking in a new gray squirrel coat and
an obviously French hat, her hair expertly coiffed.
She carries several packages.

So you must tell me. Please.

SALLY
But what am I supposed to tell you?

NATALIA
I wish to know, please, if I should
marry him. ily parents tell me no.
. They care for me. They think only of
me, and they do not care for him.
and he is not Jewish, I have always
wished to warry a Jewish man, but
now £ do not care. I truly do not
care about that, Only I think perhaps
there is something of Herr 'lendel...
something of him.,.something wrong.
And that therefore I should not
marry him. You will advise me, please?

solemn confession)

Yell, I....I really don't know what
exactly, But I don't really think
he's...your kind. I don't think you
ought to marry him....since you ask
me like that, point-blank.

WATALIA
I really do not think so, too.

I will kill myself. .

SALLY (cont)
(there is a moment of
silence between them as
they studiously avoid looking
at each other)
I'm awfully scared, Brian.

BRIAN
Oh, Sally, what are you going to
do?

SALLY

Well, obviously, i can't have the
baby...I'd be a rotten mother, Just
a betrayed whore.

BRIAN
411 you for God's sake stop
calling yourself that! You know
you're not.

SALLY begins to weep quietly. BRIAN goes to her,
takes her in his arms. .

SALLY
The doctor I went to will do it.
But it's horribly expensive...he
has to bribe somebody for some kind
of certificate or something. I'll
have to give him my fur coat...

BRIAN
Sally...

SALLY
(begins to sob)
Oh, Bri, I have never in my life
been so terrified! Oh, Christ, it's
awful!

Silently, BRIAN holds herr finally, she straightens
up, sniffing, pulling herself together.

SALLY
It's so awful to think about,..that
there's something alive inside of you,
and you can't let it live...

I don't think you'd be a rotten e
mother, Sally.

Oh, for God's sake, Brian, don't be
soft. ‘that difference does it make
what kind of mother I'd be?

BRIAN
I'll marry you, Sally.

I think I might rather like being
a futher, It would be something...
definite.

SALLY
Oh, darling! You're always so nice.
(her lip trembles somewhere
between tears and laughter)
I mean, it probably is your baby, but
just suppose it turns out to be a nasty
little coked-up Kraut!
(BRIAN laughs, SALLY
smiles)
Anyway, you don't have any money.

SRIAN
W@ can go back to England, I have
an aunt,...I can borrow enough to get
us home and then I can get some
kind of job teaching.

awe and doubt)

You will sec. Once Sally becomes
a wife, she will be most proud

BRIAN ,
You're very sweet, Watalia, But
too gonerous,

As they walk through the store, NATALIA gravely and
graciously receives the unspoken homage of store
employees.

Almost immediately, BRIAN and NATALIA find themselves
part of a crowd that has formed a tense knot on the
sidewalk. The crowd is composed of PEDESTRIANS

who have stopped,to watch the antics of three NAZIS,
two of whom are using bright yellow paint to scrawl,
in giant letters, :

“JUDEN" .

on LANDAUER's show windows. The third NAZI harangues
the CROD.

NAZI
Gute Deutsche kaufen von anderen

("Good Germans buy from other
Germans. Tney do not support
this blight on our economy...

Come on, Watalia ... let's get out
of here we. :

NATALIA
(fiercely, shaking off
his protective arm)
Wo! I won't!

This English expletive draws the attention of the
NAZI speechmaker. He sccwls at her,

NAZI

You do not agree, Fraulein? You
would encourage the Jews to go on
feeding and fattening from the bare
bones of good Germans?,

NATALIA
{so furious, she is not
even slightly frightened)
It is not tae Jews, but pigs like
you who are looking for someone
to feed off...

WAZI
You call me a pig...Jew whore!

The CROW begins to mill in fright. The lead NAZI
starts toward WATALIA, BRIAN pushes her back, trying
to move backwards himself, but still protect her...
others in the crowd move to protect NATALIA...some
move avay..,there is much pushing and shoving.

CUT TO:
CLOSEUP NATALIA

Enraged. She will not be saved. Fights her way
free of BRIAN, shoulders her way toward the NAZI.

NATALIA
Lying scum!

‘iLldly, NATALIA swings her purse at the leering face...
she almost makes contact, but he ducks. At this
moment, someone throws a stone...whether at the store,
the WAZI, or NATALIA, we do not know. Glass shatters,
women scream, the WAZI dodges away, the shattering
glass catches NATALIA, cuts her forehead,

SRIAN, pushing his way to her, grabs her and pulls
her ruthlessly through the panicky crowd.

Tenderly, he kneels in front of WATALIA, who sits
stiffly upright in a chair, her hand covering not only
her forehead, but as much of her eyes as possible...
she will not look at FRITZ.

WATALIA
Brian did not tell me you were
here,

FRITZ

He did not know.

BRIAN removes the hand from her face in order to

apply the plaster. FRITZ gasps when he sees the

vound, It is superficial.,.but it is his NATALIA
who is wounded, BRIAN puts the plaster over the

cut.

FRITZ
You must go to a doctor, It will
not be clean enough from just
washing. There must be a disinfectant.

BRIAN
(goes to cupboard)
Let me get you some brandy,
Natalia.

NATALIA
(very uneasy under the
attentions of the hovering
FRITZ)
I do not think so.
BRIAN
Yes, but I do think so, You need
something, -And it’s quite good
brandy. It's part of...quite a
good loot. I'm going to have some.

It needs another plaster...this one
will let in too much air...dust...

SALLY stands quietly watching FRITZ attend to
NATALIA.

PRITZ peels another plaster.

NATALIA
I can put it on myself.

I know, but let-me do it, please.
Drink your brandy and let me do it.

WATALIA, although she tries not to show it, is
very touched.

BRIAN sees SALLY is drinking gin. Quietly he takes

They sneer if I'm holding her hand,
But if they could see her through my eyes,
