around 60, gets out of the car and stands a moment. The
marquee in front of the school says - GOOD LUCK, CLASS OF 94.
The rope on the flagpole clangs against tha pole - a lonely
desolate sound.

Holland grabs his old, battered briefcase and some folding
file boxes from the car and heads towards the building.

INT. SCHOOL - DAY

Lockers hang open and empty. Holland walks down the hallway.
The lockers are open. at the end of the hall a janitor
sweeps. Holland stops in front of the trophy case.... stares
at the photos and trophies for a moment. He continues on
down che ampty hall.

to his desk and puta down his briefcase. He beging to put

Portland, Oregon. School buses pull up in front of a high
school and discharge students. Cars pull in - teachers and
Students going into their respeccive lots.

A Corvair convertible comes past the front of the school and
slows. Holland stares out. The magic is Playing on hia car
radio. Above the entrance the nama of the school is being
changed. ‘James A. Garfield" is now just a shadow on the
unfaded brick. The maintenance man ts on a ladder scrubbing
away the dirt with a wire brush. On the grass below, the new
letters are laid out - ‘John P. Kennedy". Holland tugs ac
the collar of his shirt - he's not used to wearing a necktie.

unwraps and opens the box. There's a photo with a lipstick
kiss on it. There’s also a new leather briefcase.

GLENN gets out of his car and is locking ic when a another
car pulls in next to him. A humorless looking man, Glenn's
age gets out. Holland hesitates... and then:

HOLLAND
Morning!

The guy. EUGENE WOLTERS, turns as if startled.

HOLLAND
Glenn Holland. I'm the new music
teacher.

Wolters sort of nods and turns away to lock his car.

HOLLAND

WOLTERS

HOLLAND
Ah. Vice Principal Wolters. 1 like a
man who's idencity is intrinsically
linked to his job description.

Wolters turns to stare at him.

WOLTERS

Holland has - too ‘many times now. He forces a grin,

HOLLAND
Yeah, well, unless Ralph wants to buy me
a new car, I guess I'll be keeping this
baby til the wheels fall off.

icebreaker. Holland has to move and dodge to even barely
keep up.

Never thought I'd be here.

JACOBS
No?- Why not?

Holland enters. He sets his briefcase on the desk. He looks
around the room. A piano. A record player. A white faux
marble bust of Beethoven. A scale of notes. above the
blackboard - the rest of the room undecorated. Holland opens
a desk drawers - looks in - finds it empty except for a stray
pencil stub or paper clip. Students begin to enter. Holland
turns, nods at them nervously. Trying to look busy, he takes
a music textbook from his briefcase and plops it down on the
desk. He stares ac it with the same enthusiasm the students
probably will. . The class is beginning to fill.

HOLLAND
Let's all... take a seat, please.
Turning to the blackboard, he looks for some chalk... and

can't find it. He hears giggles behind him. He picks up a
stub of chalk.and prints his name. The bell rings as he
finishes. The students grow silent. Glenn takes a breath.

giggling at a corner table.

Holland is in the food line with the students. He picks up a
tray. BILL MEISTER, thirty years old, in a gym teacher's
slacks and sport shirt, cuts into line and grabs a tray,
joining him. Bill's a big guy - thoughtful, soft-spoken.

INT. HIGH SCHOOL STUDY HALL ~ AFTERNOON 20
The hall is full of students. They're chatting. Nothing out

The boys leap for their seats. Students grabs for their work.
WOLTERS

such a happy baby.

IRIS HOLLAND is behind a tripod-mounted camera.

IRIS
Ba~ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba! Look at the funny-

And Iris crosses her eyes and sticks out her tongue. The
baby shrieks in horror. The living room of the apartment has
been turned into a photography studio, lights are set up, a
large paper backdrop hanging from one wall - everything
crowded against the huge record collection and the piano.

notation and chord progression. Holland, open textbook in

HOLLAND
- when a flat precedes a note - like this
- it indicates that the note should be
played a half step lower. A piece based
on the F major scale has a flat sign at
the beginning of each stave. This is the
key signature and tells us which notes
have to be altered throughout the
piece... Now -

stares at the floor.

Louis Russ is proud of himself, and rightly so. But Holland
too is swelled up like a Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade

little hand. The band moves by.

Suddenly the fire engine that follows the band let's loose on
the air horn. Frightened babies start to cry. The fire
engine hits the horn again. The babies wail.

Iris stares down at Cole, concern in her face. Nor because

Holland stands at the front of the classroom. A piece of
music written by Beethoven plays on his record player.

Because Beethoven couldn't hear, the
thought of him composing, let alone
conducting was anethma to his critics.
To answer them he composed and conducted

Imagine him, on the podium, baton in hand
moving gracefully through the air. The
orchestra in his head playing
beautifully, but the orchestra in front
of him furiously trying to stay with him.

Holland pauses, his voice grows heavy with emotion.

HOLLAND
There is a school of thought that says
that in order to write his music, he
sawed off the legs on his piano so that
the body lay flat on the ground. He
would then lie down... next to the piano,
put his ear to the ground and pound out
the notes... trying to feel them through

arm movements. He begins to imitate them. Holland closes
his eyes for the last few bars. Cole does the same. The
music ends, but Cole continues to conduct, his eyes still
closed. He hasn't heard the music stop. Tha students break
into amused giggles. Nothing cruel about the laughter but
Holland watches his son and hides the hurt.

*Loule, Loule* fills the air, played by the school band. The

townsfolk. There is a banner over the stage - "Goodbye. Mr.

escorts him towards the stage. As he passes, people raach

out of the audience to shake his hand. We begin to recognize
older versions of Holland's students. Tidd - Auss's parents

Holland up the steps to the stage, to the podium in front of

they wanted to throw a little send-off.

There is a sudden murmur in the audience. Iris stops.

the back of the gymnasium.

Looks like my watch is fast.

The murmur in the audience increases. A few words are
audible. "The Governor... “It's the Governor!" “Here!*
"where?" “I can't see..." "Look, over there!" The two
Highway Patrolmen walk down the aisle ahead of a
distinguished looking woman in glasses. She is followed by

music programs in this state.

for the applause to die down.

GERTRUDE
Mr. Holland had a profound influence on
my life. On a lot of lives, I know. And
yet, I have the feeling that Mr. Holland
considers a great part of his life
misspent. Rumor has it he was always
working on this symphony of his, his
opus. Someday it would make him famous,
rich, probably both. But Mr. Holland
isn't rich. Or famous, at least not
outside our little town. And so perhaps
it: would be easy for Mr. Holland to think
himself a failure. And he would be
wrong. For LI think he has achieved a
success beyond riches and fame. Look
around you, Mr. Holland. There is not a
life in this room that you have not
touched. And each of us is a better
person because of you. This is your
symphony, Mr. Holland. These people are
the notes and melodies of your opus. And
this is the music of your life.

The audience rises and gives Holland a standing ovation. He
leeks out at the audience, each face a memory, a moment of

Laughter.
She waits

GERTRUDE
And now we would like to give you
something back. Mr. Holland, if you
would, take this bacon and begin the
first public performance of “The American
Opus“ by Glenn Holland.

She hands him the baton. Holland turns to the orchestra.
The instruments are poised and ready. He looks down at the
music stand. The sheet music is a copy of the original, in
his handwriting. “The American Opus" by Glenn Holland. He
turns, looks at Iris. She nods as if telling him it's cime
to begin. He turns back, raises the baton, taps it once on
the music stand and... the orchestra plays. The opening
strains of the music fill the gym. Holland's face glows and
his chest fills with pride. It is a symphony with elements
of jazz, rock, country, tin pan alley, and classical.

A woman enters at the back of the auditorium. Expensively
dressed. Beautiful. The people there stare at her in
surprise and recognition. They whisper among themselves.
Rowena.

Gertrude goes over to one of the boys playing the clarinec
and whispers in his ear. And she takes che clarinet, takes
the student's seat, and plays. Then, out of the audience,
one or two at a time, other adults approach the stage and -
one by one - they replace the students in the orchestra.
Holland looks at one of the men in the orchestra.

HOLLAND
{softly)
Spit valve.

The man blushes and glances at the red haired women next to
hin.

Eventually the orchestra is composed completely of adults.
Tears stream openly down Holland's face as he leads them. The
various themes become clear - Cole's theme, the music for
Louis Russ, an ode to Coltrane, Rowena's theme. It's all
there and as it reaches it‘s climax, we FREEZE... on Glernn
Holland who created it all...
