FADE IN: DAY--EARLY AUTUMN

A seldom travelled farm-to-market road in South East:.
Texas. A car drives down the road through haif-picked
: cotton fields, corn fields, and grazing fields dotted
. with cattle.
Every now and again a house can be seen. Up ahead we
see an unpretentious motel sign. The car slows down
as it approaches the motel, sees gas pumps in the yard
_ and pulls off the road to the gas pumps. aA man and a
woman ‘are in the car and they are strangers and look
around to see if anyone is there to artend to chem.
The motel consists of four small guest cottages. Two
are rented and two unoccupied, and a small house near
the gas pumps. Out of the house comes MAC SLEDGE, 44,

-and he goes to the car. .

MAC

Yes sir.

He gets the gas hose and puts it in the car's tank.

His wife, ROSA LEE, 28, comes out of the house. She
sits in a straight chair in the yard of the house watching
her husband work. MAC takes the pump out ef the gas ©
tank and goes over to the man driving the car.

MAC
That will be twelve dollars.
The man takes his wallet cut to get the money.

take a left turn at the first

books; slamming the door behind him.

_MAC walks around the station to the back.

“There is a small garden about two hundred yards from the
house and he walks over to the garden plot, picks up a
hoe lying on the ground and begins to chop weeds. « tt is
a vegetable garden and it is well tended. -

As he works he sings a few bars of a song to himself...
A country Western song. We don't hear enough of the song
to know if ic is familiar or what kind of a singer he is.

m~ ROSA LEE comes around the house and joins him in the garden.
She has a basket and begins to pick tomatoes and dig turnips
He stops singing as she approaches.
They work along in silence for a beat and then she begins
singing a hymn to herself.."Count Your Blessings." She
has a pleasant voice. After a few phrases he Joins in
singing with her. He has a stronger voice than hers, but

. we can still tell nothing of its quality. They continue

singing as they work. :
They hear a car drive up. The driver honks for service and
MAC puts the hoe dowm and goes toward the filling station
to service the car. ROSA LEE continues her work.

room.+ He gets it.

CLOSE SHOT - MAC
He sings a bit of the song we heard him singing earlier

I just came across that old song
one day. I wrote it I don't know
how many years ago. I couldn't do
nothing with it then, so I don't
know why I figured I could do any-
thing with it now. Any way, I
figured if I could I might get us
a few dollars ahead so you wouldn't
have to work so hard.

ROSA LEE -

I don't work ali that hard.
MAC
" Yes, you do, too.
ROSA LEE
You work hard, too.
MAC

Any way, I just thought I'd try Harry
since he was an old friend of mine.

He showed it to Dixie which I didn't
really want him to do, I really only

_ wanted his opinion. Any way, she said

ANGLE - ROSA LEE

it was no good and he agreed with her.
(He cries.) You know. I don't give
a God damm about any of this no more.
So what in the hell is wrong with me.
I guess it's just hearing about my
little girl being grown up and all and
being spoiled by Dixie.

Oh, sure. I know that's hard on
you not being able to see her. (SHE

hate for anything to ever come

had to give up Sonny I don't kmow
what I'd do.

When his daddy died and people said
oh, it’s too bad you're left with
this little boy to raise - too bad
for who, I said - not for me! I
consider it a prvilege to have this
blessed child to raise. And I did,
too.

it to her. I don't know wny I lied
about that, except I was ashamed of
myself, I guess, for ever asking’ a
favor of her again.
He sings part of the song. .
It is the song we have heard earlier. The song is
personal, yet direct and affecting in its simplicity
as the best of Country Western songs can be. His manner
of singing the song also is direct and uncomplicated
and one senses whatever else he has a very personal style
when he sings. He stops.

Well, two of them came by here
after you were gone and left off
a poster. (She points to it.)
I asked them if they could read

° music and one of them could and so

’  E asked if they would teach me that

song of yours as I thought I would
surprise you by singing it for you
when you got home. I told them you
wrote it a long time ago and you :
didn't like it, but I thought the
words were pretty and I wanted to
hear what the music was like and so
one of them sang it for me. ¢

ANGLE ~- MAC

I think it's pretty song, Mac and
so does he - and he was wondering
if you would let him and his band
play it. (A pause.) I said I
couldn't answer that. He'd have

_ to ask you. (A pause.) I said I
would ask you. I said it was an old
song and you might not....

It's no old song. I only wrote it
last week. That's why I got so_.
upset when Harry said he didn’t like
it.

comes out with a small trunk.)

I been writing them all along. I
got even more in here. (A pause.)

MAC
One is called, "God Has Forgiven
Me, Why Can't You", and one is
called, "The Romance Is Over."

(He opens the trunk and we can
see sheet music inside.)

“There they are. You can look at
them. But don’t be showing them
to anybody or telling them about
them. I don't want them boys running
me crazy. (A pause.)
Did you learn the song?

ROSA LEE
Yes, I did.

 

MAC .
Let me hear you sing it. ‘

She sings it, sweetiy and sincerely, but she is still not
too sure of the words or the tune.

I had an Auntie taught me. We
had an old half busted piano

couldn't stand it.. She went home.

looking for her and I found her
and she was living with another

I met her and she said she would
give it up as soon as she married,
but then she recorded a song of
mine and she done well with it and
she said she wanted to sing for
five years and get it out of her

MAC

I was almost killed once in a

ear accident. I was drunk and

I ran off the side of the road
and turned over four times, and
they took me out of that car for
dead. But I lived. And I prayed
“last night to know why I lived
and she died, but I got no answer
to my prayers. I still don't
know why she died and I lived.

I don't know the answer to nothing.
Not a blessed thing. I don't
know why I wandered out to this
part of Texas drunk and you took
me in and pitied me and helped
me to straighten out and

marry me. Why? Why did that
happen? Is there a reason that -
happened? And Sonny's daddy

died in a war and my daughter
Killed in an automobile accident.
Why? Why? Why?

MAC looks up at the sky. HE looks across the Fields. ROSA

LEE watches him anxiousiy. Then she goes to him and holds

ROSA LEE
Yes. And no one could tell me
anything except he was found dead.
He was alone when they found him
and they dicn't know how long he
had been there. And so they couldn't
be sure he was killed in a battle, or
if he was, what battle, since there
had been three in that area that week,
they said, and he could have been in
any one of them. Or he could have just
been out walking, they said, and a
sniper got him. Where would he be

-walking to, IL asked, and they said

they had no more idea: than I had.
