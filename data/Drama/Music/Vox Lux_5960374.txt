INT. LIVING ROOM - HOLIDAY MORNING - 1990
VIDEO FOOTAGE -—

Open in a dark hallway. Someone off-camera fusses with the
video settings as they walk down a corridor towards a family
gathering.

At the center of everyone’s attention we find a girl at four
years old. She wears a set of cowboy boots and a red cowboy
hat. She stretches, practices aerobics. Her hair is teased
and wild.

Another young girl who looks nearly identical sits off to the
side.

Despite the verbose nature of the text, a NARRATOR speaks
over the image in an unaffected tone.

NARRATOR
Celeste was born in America in
1986. Considering her parent’s
background, education, and
socioeconomic status - being on the
losing side of “Reaganomics” - the
name of Latin origin seemed an
especially poetic choice. It carved
her out some pre-determined
destination; a route which to
travel by.

She performs a sort of clumsy square dance in front of where
her grandfather and uncle play a duet and sing at a Casio
keyboard.

OFF-CAMERA VOICE
Celeste, look at me. Look at the
camera.

She ignores the request.

NARRATOR
-and many years before CE-LE-STE
rolled off the cultural tongue like
a principled anecdote one senses
they were born knowing; she might
not have been described as all that
special or conspicuously talented,
however, she did possess that
proverbial “something” which on
occasion captured the attention of
her teachers and young peers.
3.

A few other family members cheer her on, laughing and gay,
but CELESTE is lost, staring at her feet trying not to trip
in her stiff new boots.

OFF-CAMERA VOICE
Darling, look at me. Look up.

NARRATOR
Despite what naysayers or haters
later perceived of her ingenuity,
she was actually a very savvy
businesswoman. In the beginning,
she was kind and full of grace, and
at least she wrote her own lyrics;
no one could take that away from
her.

The YOUNG GIRL finally acknowledge’s the OFF-CAMERA VOICE.
Her eyes are blue and piercing. Her expression is possessed.

OFF-CAMERA VOICE
Can you sing us the song you sang
to me in the car?

She doesn’t reply but her gaze remains locked on the lens.

FADE TO BLACK:

A BEAT OF SILENCE, THEN...

A booming orchestral score chugs, building towards a grand
swooning movement...

BLACK fades and gives way to a rush of color, shades of
violet and cyan.

The NARRATOR’s voice now fights to be heard over the
increasingly cacophonous sound. The shape of the recording
evolves into something like a bad radio transmission.

NARRATOR
She would be 13 going on 14 years
old in the year 2000, the dawn of
the new millennium.
INSERT TITLE:

VOX LUX

Finally, the symphony begins to mimic the simpler chord
progressions of a contemporary pop song.

INSERT TITLE:

ACT I

Pop music overtakes the soundtrack.

INT. FAMILY ROOM BASEMENT - EVENING - 1999

 

WIDE ON -—

A music video glows off a television box hinged to the
ceiling.

An empty treadmill is on at full-speed.

EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - EVENING
A SERIES OF TABLEAUS -
WIDE ON -—

A row of middle-class residences line a quiet neighborhood
street.

The mood is relentlessly sombre. An ominous dark blue hue
tints at dusk.
5.

A few street lamps turn on with their timers and light pours
out living room windows from the television sets nestled
inside.

EXT. TOWN MALL - EVENING

MEDIUM ON -

Street lamps buzz and after some time turn on in staggered
sets illuminating the mall lot. A few kids hang out smoking
by the entrance

EXT. FAST FOOD CHAINS - EVENING

CLOSE ON -

One of the restaurant’s rotating signs.

NEW ANGLE ON -

Two different food chains compete for attention situated just
across from one another.

A black SUV pulls away from the drive-thru.

EXT. FOOTHILLS - LATER
A SERIES OF ANGLES -
The SUV speeds fast across the landscape, a bad omen.

It’s darker out with every new angle.

EXT. SCHOOL - NIGHT
SUPER WIDE ON -

A high school campus at night. Heaps of kids step out of
their parents’ cars. There’s an event on.

The SUV enters frame and the composition adjusts slightly to
the left compensating for the vehicle’s movement.

The distance, the quality of light - it’s sci-fi.

INT. SCHOOL CAFETERIA - NIGHT

It’s New Year’s eve.
LONG LENS ON -—

The camera meticulously pans the room. A middle school
cafeteria’s been set up as a makeshift dance hall.

Teens dance a bit provocatively with one another. A few
grind up and down each other’s thighs. They are having a
great time. The energy is infectious, intoxicating.

After some time, a fight seems to break out for no apparent
reason. The music is too loud to make out anything specific
of the conflict.

An adult supervisor, MS. DWYER, steps in to break up the
fight.

One YOUNG MAN is left in tears. He seems deeply ashamed.
MS. DWYER leans to him, putting an affectionate hand on his
shoulder. The kid brushes it off and we pan with him as he
exits by himself.

EXT. PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

PAN RIGHT -

The YOUNG MAN steps out and walks across the lot.

EXT. HIGHWAY - MOMENTS LATER

CLOSE ON -

We track with the boy for an extended period of time. He
quivers and heaves deep visible breaths into the cold night
air.

He hums a tune. After a while some light orchestra joins in
but before it can develop into much of anything, a hard cut
to-

INT. SCHOOL CAFETERIA - LATER

The students chant!

STUDENTS
10! 9! 8! 7! 6! 5! 4! 3! 2--

Before the midnight kiss --
INT. CLASSROOM - MORNING 2000
MEDIUM ON —

MS. DWYER stands near the front door of her classroom
welcoming students.

STUDENT
Good morning, Ms. Dwyer.

MS. DWYER
Welcome back. How was break?

STUDENT
Fine, thanks.

Kids file in pulling off winter jackets and taking their
seats off-screen. CELESTE walks by unnoticed.

Another student, THERESE, stops to chat with MS. DWYER.

THERESE
Morning.

SFX: The bell rings.
MS. DWYER

Happy New Year. Did you change
your hair, Therese?

THERESE
My sister cut it. She’s a
hairdresser.

MS. DWYER

Does she work in town? I’ve been
wanting a cut like that.

THERESE
(flattered)
Really? She lives out of state.
She was visiting us for the
holidays but I can let you know
when she’s back.

MS. DWYER
Would you mind?

THERESE
Sure, I can.

MS. DWYER walks over to her desk and sorts through a few
papers.
MS. DWYER
(enthusiastic)
Welcome back, everyone. Did you
have a good break?

A few reply “yes.”

MS. DWYER (CONT'D)
I got some news yesterday about our
computer appeal.

EVAN
What is it?

MS. DWYER regards her watch.

MS. DWYER
I want to wait and share once
everyone is here. We are just
waiting on Adam and Elyse.

EVAN
Probably be awhile.

MS. DWYER
Why?

EVAN murmurs something to the kid next to him.

MS. DWYER (CONT'D)
Evan, whatever you’re saying to
him, save it for after class. Let’s
please not start the year at odds.

THERESE speaks up.

THERESE
I saw Adam 15 minutes ago.

MS. DWYER
Okay, then we'll wait.

STUDENT 2
Are they giving us desktops?

MS. DWYER
I said we'll wait --

The YOUNG MAN from the school dance opens the door
interrupting the flow of conversation. MS. DWYER turns to
address him...

YOUNG MAN
Excuse me.
MS. DWYER
Yes?

He asserts himself.

YOUNG MAN
My name is Cullen Active.

MS. DWYER
What?

YOUNG MAN
My name is Cullen Active.

MS. DWYER
Yes, Cullen, I know.

The YOUNG MAN nimbly moves a handgun from the inner part of
his jacket and shoots MS. DWYER in the stomach in a single
shot.

The class shrieks and rush in a panic towards the back of the
class.

One girl sits frozen in her seat.
CLOSE ON -

A light smatter of blood adorns CELESTE’s face. Her mouth
slacks agape.

YOUNG MAN (0.S.)
Celeste?

Extended beat.

YOUNG MAN (CONT’D)
Celeste, go stand with the others.

CELESTE doesn’t move a muscle.

YOUNG MAN (CONT’D)
Please, Celeste.

She blinks.

CELESTE
Is she breathing-

YOUNG MAN (0.S.)
(deliberate)
No.

10.

YOUNG MAN (0.S.) (CONT'D)
Celeste, I need you to step away
from the windows because in a few
minutes there will be an explosion.

There’s an audible gasp from the other students. One girl
begs off-camera.

GIRL
(completely distressed)
What are you doing?! (beat) Why
are you doing this?

BACK TO -

CULLEN, the YOUNG MAN, steps further inside revealing a
machine gun.

Everyone screams.

CULLEN struggles lifting the heavy firearm but after a few
moments manages to fire it off at the ceiling. Debris falls
into the room.

CELESTE (0.S.)
Stop!

BACK TO CLOSE-UP ON CELESTE -
CELESTE (CONT'D)
Please. Please stop. I am
standing, I’1l stand.

CELESTE stands and camera booms up with her, accommodating
her movement.

Focus is shallow as she decides to turn her back on CULLEN

and approach the group. Finally she reaches the others and
turns around.

INT. AXIS OF SCHOOL HALLWAYS - MOMENTS LATER

 

Kids flood the hallways in terror. Adults hover over them
trying their best to coordinate a safe exit.

EXT. SCHOOL - MOMENTS LATER

Several kids hang from the second story of the school
lowering themselves to safety.
EXT. FOOTHILLS - MOMENTS LATER
SUPER WIDE ON -
From a distance, among the foothills, the campus is

After some time, a car explodes in the parking lot.

INT. CLASSROOM - MOMENTS LATER

CLOSE ON -
CELESTE’s expression falls between a state of shock
grace... MS. DWYER’s class is evermore hysterical.
CELESTE
Cullen.

CULLEN sounds as if he might be crying now.

CELESTE (CONT'D)
Cullen, please let us go.

YOUNG MAN (0.S.)
I killed plenty of people. I can’t
now.

CELESTE
Please.

CELESTE blinks a tear.

CELESTE (CONT'D)
Please at least let everyone else
out of here and I'll stay here with
you.

YOUNG MAN (0.S.)
What are we going to do?

A moment passes before some words fall from Celeste’

mouth...

CELESTE
We'll pray together.

She turns to comfort the girl next to her.

CELESTE (CONT'D)
Shh... It’s going to be okay,--

A round of shots light up the screen and CELESTE is shot
through the side of her neck. She drops out of frame with
all of her weight in a loud thud.

INT. SCHOOL CAFETERIA - MOMENTS LATER

 

Officers cautiously file in according to a well-coordinated
protocol.

OFFICER
Clear.

INT. SCHOOL HALLWAYS - MOMENTS LATER

 

STEADICAM ON —

A SWAT team who seem to have entered the building from
another entrance make their way down the corridor.

SFX: We hear each voice as if over a police radio. It’s
disorienting and does not always correspond with the image as
there are additional officers coming over the feed.

They splinter off and check room after room for survivors.
The sequence is relentless, unsettling, redundant.

SWAT 1
Clear.

They push down further.

SWAT 1 (CONT'D)
Clear.

A new voice interjects over the radio.

OFF-CAMERA OFFICER
Request for immediate medical
assistance. We have seven kids
here, four in critical condition,
not responding, three dead in the
south-facing corridor’s girl’s
bathroom, Ist floor.

Further, into the next room.

SWAT 1
Clear.

Further again, into the next room.
13.

SWAT 2
Clear on the left.

SWAT 1 enters the next door.

SWAT 1
Christ. I have three bodies,
fatally-wounded, adults, 1 female,
2 male, room 111.

SWAT 2
We'll come back. Keep pushing.

SWAT 3
Shooter and hostages are last
reported in the wing overhead...
Stairs are coming up on the right.

We follow the team to the right and all the way up the
stairs.

On the second floor now, the team checks room 211.

SWAT 1
Clear.

They move on to room 212 and open the door.

SWAT 3
(voice cracks in agony)
Oh no. Oh, no no no no.

MS. DWYER’s class appears dead. They lie piled on top of
each other in the back of the class.

CULLEN is also dead where he previously stood. There’s blood
absolutely everywhere.

Several students moan at the sound of the SWAT team. Several
members of the team rush to their aid.

SWAT 3 (CONT'D)

(to the students)
We're going to get you out of here.
We're here to help.

SWAT 2 speaks into his radio.

SWAT 2
Room 212, second floor, east-facing
corridor, suspect is deceased.
Several hostages are still alive,
critically injured.
14.

EXT. AERIAL VIEW OF THE SCHOOL - LATER

 

SFX: Berlioz’s choral piece “La Damnation de Faust” rings
out...

The rich orchestral score swells over the view of the school
from a helicopter.

Bold FRONT CREDITS in primary hues roll up over the image in
a scroll.

INT. AMBULANCE - LATER

CREDITS SCROLL continues over the following...

SUPER WIDE ANGLE, HANDHELD ON -

CELESTE is partially wrapped in foil, upside down on the
gurney. An oxygen mask covers her face.

The scene is frantic. Paramedics hover over her body.
PARAMEDIC
Celeste, you’re doing so good. You
just keep breathing, honey. You're
gonna feel a pinch at the base of
your spine.

The piece of music Cullen hummed as he walked home alone
before reprises over a NEW ANGLE ON CELESTE.

ULTRA SLOW MOTION -

She seems to hum along underneath the mask.

INT. REHABILITATION CENTER - DAY
AN EXTENDED SERIES OF VERITE STYLE CLOSE-UPS -—

Victims of the massacre exercise in pained, deliberate
movements. A few weeks have passed.

Some victims seem more adapted to their new circumstances
than others.

ANGLE ON -—

CELESTE’s neck is heavily bandaged. She slowly limps across
the space with her MOTHER and PHYSICAL THERAPIST at her side.

CELESTE’S MOTHER looks like she hasn’t slept in weeks.
CELESTE suddenly stops.
CELESTE’s

15.

CELESTE’S MOTHER
Tell us if you’re going to be sick
again.

CELESTE
I'm sorry...

CELESTE’S MOTHER
Don’t be sorry.

PHYSICAL THERAPIST
I’ve seen much worse. What are you
feeling now?

CELESTE
I feel like I’m on a boat.

PHYSICAL THERAPIST
Nausea won't subside?

CELESTE
It’s not just that. I just feel
like I’m spinning. You think it’s
in my head?

PHYSICAL THERAPIST
I don’t think it’s in your head at
all. I just don’t think this has
to do with the spinal injury. Are
your ears ringing?

CELESTE
I need to sit.

CELESTE’S MOTHER
I‘1l get your chair.

MOTHER leaves CELESTE who breathes hard.
PHYSICAL THERAPIST

Take another step with me while we
wait for your mom.

CELESTE takes another pained step.

Moments later she returns with a wheelchair.

CELESTE’S MOTHER
Sit, my love.

CELESTE sits sluggishly.
16.

CELESTE
Where’s dad and Eleanor?

CELESTE’S MOTHER
They went to get us some food.

PHYSICAL THERAPIST
Some of the other kids have
complained about ringing in their
ears from the gun blasts. I/’11
talk to your doctor.

INT. LAB ROOM - NIGHT

CELESTE’s body glides into a CAT scan. Her skin appears
translucent underneath the violet lamp. Here, she looks like
a cyborg.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

CELESTE’s older sister, ELEANOR (16), lies entangled in
CELESTE’s embrace. She cries for a long time holding onto
her sister tight.

The image is a kind of modern chiaroscuro; so dark that it
resembles something like a Bill Henson photograph.

ELEANOR
I’m so sorry I was sick. I should
have been there for you. I’m so
grateful you're alive. I think I
would have died - or just killed
myself. I don’t think I could have
standed it. I’m here now and I am
never going to leave you - ever.

CELESTE cries now too, smiles, and then breaks into a fit of
laughter.

CELESTE
Oh, God, Ellie. I think I've done
something terrible.

ELEANOR’s face wrinkles in anguish.

ELEANOR
It’s not your fault. What more
could you have done? You’re safe
with me.
17.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - AFTERNOON

CELESTE lies in bed with a travel CASIO keyboard on her lap.
She plays with various settings and sound FX - future sounds,
rainforest reverb.

NEW ANGLE ON -
ELEANOR reads a magazine at the end of the hospital bed. Her
FATHER reads a book in a chair. Magazine clippings are taped
all around CELESTE’S bed. Take-out containers and fast food
bags additionally litter the scene.
A nurse enters...
NURSE
Some news people are here and are

requesting an interview.

CELESTE’S FATHER
Don’t look at me. It’s up to her.

CELESTE stops playing her keyboard...

CELESTE
I don’t want anyone to see me like
this.

ELEANOR

You look fine.
CELESTE looks at ELEANOR...

CELESTE
Can you talk to them?

ELEANOR
Me? What am I supposed to say? I
wasn’t there.

CELESTE
Just tell them how sorry we are for
everyone that died.
ELEANOR looks at their dad.
CELESTE’S FATHER
(shrugs )
Call mom.

ELEANOR
Are you sure, Celeste?

CELESTE nods...
18.

NURSE
I can take you to a telephone.

ELEANOR gets off the bed and exits the room with the NURSE.
CELESTE looks at her FATHER.

CELESTE
I think I want to try and sleep for
awhile.

He immediately stands, taking the hint.

CELESTE’S FATHER
Yeah, I was going to try and take
your mom out and get her mind off
things... You need anything more
than the piano? I got a guitar in
the basement. I can teach you to
play it.

CELESTE
Thanks but it’s hard for me to tilt
my head down.

CELESTE’S FATHER
All right, I‘'1l see you in the
morning. I love you to the moon

and back.

CELESTE
I know. Me too. Please don’t be
sad.

CELESTE’S FATHER
I’m not sad. I’m relieved.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

 

ELEANOR lies with her head on CELESTE who plays a melody on
her keyboard. Celeste seems to have something in mind but
struggles to find the right note.

They begin to hum...

SLOW FRONTAL PUSH IN ON CELESTE -

The light from the hospital television set illuminates the
darkness of her concerned expression.

For a flash, she suddenly appears quite iconic.
19.

INT. PARK - NIGHT

One hundred persons walk in silence carrying candles beneath
their chins.

LOUDSPEAKER VOICE (0.S.)
Two sophomore students, Vanessa
Cooke and Elyse Hanlin, remain in
eritical condition. Hold them
especially in your prayers and
please join me in a moment of
silence.

ANGLE ON -—

CELESTE’s MOTHER and FATHER who push CELESTE in a wheelchair.
ELEANOR walks to the side.

INT. CHURCH - NIGHT
THREE QUARTER PROFILE ON -

FATHER CLIFF preaches in front of his congregation. He stops
to cry occasionally without affectation. His tone is direct
and sincere. He breathes evenly trying to gather himself.

FATHER CLIFF
You'll have to excuse me. These are
not only tears of profound sorrow
but of profound joy, as well,
because I see so many young faces
here before me whom we helplessly
feared for many hours forever lost.

The audience is audibly moved by his frankness.

FATHER CLIFF (CONT'D)

We are here to honor your heroism
and mourn the loss of your loved
ones and peers. First, I have a
difficult request to put forth but
as I see it, it’s the only way we
might begin to move forward...

Heaving sobs ring out off-screen.
20.

FATHER CLIFF (CONT'D)
Ferocious anger and hatred caused
this and we can’t have any more
anger around us this minute so I
must ask you to include the
perpetrator of these vicious
attacks and his parents in our
prayers tonight, as they too lost
their child in January.

ANGLE ON -—

Photographers stand at the side aisles. Bulbs flash again
and again.

FATHER CLIFF (CONT'D)

By this way of healing prayer,
victims of the tragedy will be
released from their own grief and
rage in the afterlife, and they
shall live forever in our hearts.
Lives lost too young here on earth
but with whom we all anxiously wait
to be reunited. They walk with God
now...

A SERIES OF PORTRAITS -

VARIOUS PARISHIONERS weep... The crowd largely dons their
school colors and team jerseys.

ANGLE ON -—

We finally reach ELEANOR and CELESTE who sit quietly like a
couple of nuns with their eyes reverently closed.

FATHER CLIFF (CONT'D)
We'll be inviting Ridgewood
students to take my place - share
their thoughts, memories, feelings
with all of you. To begin, please
join me in welcoming a very brave
young woman to the piano. She has
prepared a piece of music for us
all tonight. Celeste?

CELESTE uses a set of crutches to get herself to a piano
that’s been set up with a microphone. She slides onto the
bench and clears her throat... She really looks very
beautiful. A necklace covers her bandaged neck.

Everyone claps for her in support.
CELESTE

(into the mic)
Uh, I tried to prepare something to
say but I couldn’t really put my
feelings into words exactly so I
thought I’d try and do this
instead. My sister, Ellie, helped
me.

She starts meekly but after the first verse, her voice begins

to rise up emotively.

CLOSE ON -
CELESTE....
CELESTE (CONT'D)
(sings)
Don’t be afraid father, you raised
us well.

I heard your voice cry out with the
day’s first bell.

And the bells tolled and the sirens
rang o-ut

I can feel my chest tightening,
squeezing on-to my he-art

The music moves through her. Whatever of it’s clumsiness,

the performance is undeniably moving.

CELESTE (CONT'D)
(shouts, sings)

So, if fear is like fire then I’m

burning

AND if it’s fear you desire to

locate in me, then I’m turning

right back around and RUNNING INTO

THE TWENT-I-ETH CENTURY

So now I’m asking you, am I allowed

to ever sleep again?

Am I allowed to ever dream again?

How may I care-less-ly ever live

care-free again?

SLOW PUSH IN ON -
A news crew adjusts their lens for a close-up.

NARRATOR
At the advice of her first ever
producer, Celeste would change the
lyric from “I” to “we,” and shortly
thereafter, the entire country fell
into step with her sentiment.

(MORE )
22.

NARRATOR (CONT'D)
It was not her grief anymore, it
was their grief; no longer merely
her experience, they reclaimed it
as their own.

We push towards them, they push towards us.

NARRATOR (CONT’D)
The song would become an anthem for
the nation. Simply put, it was a
hit.

EXT. NEW YORK CITY - DAY

A SERIES OF BOLD, ICONIC SHOTS OF THE CITY. The score swells
and pulses.

LONG LENS ON -—

Bright-eyed CELESTE is walking again. She and ELEANOR
traverse the avenue next to an unkempt rock and roll MANAGER.

Focus favors CELESTE as they walk amongst pedestrians. She
looks like a star.

INT. RECORDING STUDIO - LATER
VERITE HANDHELD ON -
CELESTE stands in the mic room next to a SESSION BASSIST.

CELESTE
(sings)

Don’t be afraid father, you raised
us well.
I heard your voice cry out with the
day’s first bell.
And the bells tolled and the sirens
rang o-ut
I can feel my chest tightening,
squeezing on-to my he-art

CELESTE stops and swallows.
CELESTE (CONT'D)
Sorry. I’m getting thrown off from
hearing my own voice.

ANGLE ON -—

MUSIC PRODUCER in the control room.
23.
MUSIC PRODUCER
You want me to pull that out?

CELESTE
If you can do that, thanks.

MUSIC PRODUCER
(mutters )
No problem.
BACK TO -
CELESTE & the SESSION BASSIST
SESSION BASSIST
You like when I come down to a G
for the refrain?
CELESTE
No, not that. I thought that was
D, sorry.

SESSION BASSIST
That is the D, just next to it.

CELESTE
Oh! Then yes, I like the G.

ANGLE ON -
A team of Scandinavian producers, ELEANOR, several Heads of
Department, and CELESTE’s new MANAGER stand at the control
board.
THE MANAGER hits a button so she can hear him.

THE MANAGER

you wanna step out for a moment,
get some fresh air?

INT. RECORDING STUDIO HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

 

HANDHELD ON-

THE MANAGER paces around CELESTE with ferocious, anxious
energy.

He stammers, stutters, hammers through the language...
THE MANAGER

you okay in there, you in over your
head?
24.

CELESTE
No, I’m good.

THE MANAGER
remember what I told you at your
parent’s place, the first time i
saw you?

CELESTE blinks, not sure where he’s going with this.

THE MANAGER (CONT’D)
you just gotta shut your eyes and
pretend like you’re in your
bedroom. you're just dancing in
your bedroom and no one is looking
at you. you don’t have a care in
the world

CELESTE
Yeah.

THE MANAGER

(smiles)
you gotta tell me if i’m not making
sense, okay? you got your head on
so straight that half the time i
forget you’re a kid. it’s okay if
you don’t understand something and
you need me to explain, okay?

CELESTE
That’s okay.

THE MANAGER
you gotta tune all these people out
and just sing from your gut cause i
know you’re trying to help out in
there but we only got 45 minutes
left or this all gets very
expensive. don’t worry yourself too
much with the technical stuff
anyway because I’1l tell you, those
people in there aren’t coming to
listen to that fuckin’ bass player
riff like he’s Jaco Pastorius. this
is your show. remember that and run
it, okay?

CELESTE blinks.

CELESTE
Okay.
25.

THE MANAGER
you ready to head back in?

CELESTE
Yes, but can you do me a favor?

THE MANAGER
anything.

CELESTE
Can you watch your language around,
Eleanor? It really bothers her
when people swear.

THE MANAGER
yeah, i’m sorry. i wasn’t thinking.
i didn’t mean to swear at you.
forgive me.

INT. RECORDING STUDIO - MOMENTS LATER

CLOSE ON -

CELESTE’s
crown her

face who stands at the mic. A pair of headphones
head.

MUSIC PRODUCER (0.S.)
I’ve just cut together something
for the first and last verse and it
actually seems like it’s working
really well. We might be over-
thinking it. In the bridge though,
there’s a little crack or hiccup or
something on the delivery of “So
now I’m asking...” so maybe let’s
just take it from there?

CELESTE has assumed a new confidence.

ANGLE ON -—

CELESTE
Great. I’1l nail it and then can
we get started on Please Remember?

MUSIC PRODUCER (0.S.)
Sorry but which section is that?

CELESTE
It’s the next track.

The MUSIC PRODUCER behind the glass.
26.

MUSIC PRODUCER
Ah! Yes. Let’s get a head start
on tomorrow.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - AFTERNOON
The girls sit reading a magazine next to THE MANAGER.
NEW ANGLE ON -

Camera pans with a young woman, MARKETING PR, as she enters
and sits at a dark conference table across CELESTE, ELEANOR,
and THE MANAGER.

MARKETING PR
Sorry, I’m late. Thanks for
waiting.

THE MANAGER nods.

MARKETING PR (CONT'D)
(to CELESTE and ELEANOR)
Have you girls been enjoying your
stay?

ELEANOR
Yes, the hotel’s very nice.

CELESTE is focused, intuitively professional somehow.

CELESTE
Yes, it’s great. So, what’s next?

THE MANAGER
she beat me to the punch.

MARKETING PR clears her throat.

MARKETING PR
Well, a few things. First, I’ve
been meaning to ask you if you have
any background in dance or if your
injury prevents you from...

CELESTE
I used to take ballet.

BEAT.

CELESTE (CONT'D)
And no, I just have to be careful.
27.

MARKETING PR
That’s great. Internally, we've
been discussing a few upcoming
appearances we’d like to pitch you
for and we’d love to set you up
with a choreographer.

CELESTE
Okay. What kind of appearances?

MARKETING PR
In-store performances, things like
that. It’s a great way to introduce
your live experience to the public
and a great way for you to get your
feet wet, in turn.

Beat. Something heavy hangs in the air.

MARKETING PR (CONT'D)
Celeste, we really love what you do
here-

CELESTE
Thanks.

MARKETING PR
-but after everything you've been
through, I just think it’s
necessary to be straight with you
and let you know that there’s no
guarantee these new tracks will
work-

THE MANAGER
hey, hey, hey, she’s 14 years old.
you don’t need to talk that way to
the kid. talk to me that way, not
her.

MARKETING PR is very firm with THE MANAGER.

MARKETING PR
Let me finish please. (back to
Celeste) Before we go ahead making
a lot of plans together, it would
be unconscionable for me to not
make a young person like yourself
fully cognizant of the reality of
the situation. You’ve given us a
great demo to work with and we are
going to pitch it hard but the rest
is out of our hands.
28.

CELESTE
It’s fine. If it works, great, if
not, that’s okay too.

MARKETING PR smiles. She removes some mock-ups from a file.

MARKETING PR
Onto the fun stuff then, this is
what we had in mind in terms of
artwork for the EP we’ll be sending
to the stations. What do you
think?

CELESTE
Yeah, it’s good, I like it.

THE MANAGER is unimpressed, a bit like a petulant kid.

THE MANAGER
less beige.

MARKETING PR
We can change the color. Right
now, try and focus more on the
feeling of the layout.

CELESTE looks at him.

CELESTE
I like it.

ELEANOR
I like it too.

THE MANAGER
great, they know what they like.

MARKETING PR

(simple)
That's great, we love it. The
lyric inside of the font gives it
precedence - the sentient of a new
voice being announced - but the
most important thing to us is that
you feel well-represented.

CELESTE
I feel well-represented.
INT. OFFICE HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

DOLLY ON -
29.

We urgently follow THE MANAGER, CELESTE, and ELEANOR.

THE MANAGER
as your representative, i’d like to
express how highly unusual and
inappropriate that woman’s conduct
was. i had no idea she was going to
sit down and give you a list of
reasons she’s not to be held
accountable if she fails at her
job. these sales people; five
minutes into a meeting you know
they couldn’t sell a life-jacket to
natalie wood.

CELESTE
She was just telling me not to get
my hopes up.

THE MANAGER
of course you should get your hopes
up.
INT. HOTEL GYM - DAY
FOUR ANGLES ON -

CELESTE walks on a treadmill.

After some time, she begins to adjust the settings to
something more challenging.

She sets her pace to a jog.

Her breathing rises in intensity.

INT. BALLET STUDIO - DUSK

Quiet... The light is beautiful in the studio. Particle Mist
falls around.

VERITE HANDHELD ON -

CELESTE and a CHOREOGRAPHER work on a series of moves for her
upcoming performances.

CHOREOGRAPHER
Keep your abdominal muscles as
stiff as you can.

She does as she’s asked, leaps into his arms. She bites her
lip.
30.
CHOREOGRAPHER (CONT’D)
Okay, almost, and again.
She repeats the steps and leaps into his arms.

CHOREOGRAPHER (CONT’D)
Better. Try again.

The CHOREOGRAPHER puts her down. She winces in pain.

CHOREOGRAPHER (CONT’D)
Are you all right? We can take a

break.

CELESTE
I’m fine, but can we turn the music
on?

CHOREOGRAPHER

Yeah, let me put the disc on.

The choreographer steps over to a CD player as CELESTE walks
around for a moment trying to shake the pain off.

CHOREOGRAPHER (CONT’D)
You ready?

CELESTE
Yes, I’m ready

The CHOREOGRAPHER presses play...

SFX: A NEW SONG OF CELESTE’S BLARES LOUD IN THE STUDIO SPACE.
ALREADY FROM THE FIRST FEW BARS, IT’S EXTREMELY EFFECTIVE,
CATCHY.

CELESTE and her CHOREOGRAPHER begin again working on a series
of steps. She’s doing quite well.

CHOREOGRAPHER
Good!

She looks at him and takes a few more impressive steps.

CHOREOGRAPHER (CONT’D)
That’s great. Hold on..

He runs over and stops the disc, restarts.
31.

CHOREOGRAPHER (CONT’D)
(shouts over music)

Let’s do it again but this time try
and sing a little as we go and see
how it feels. Focus on your
breathing, otherwise, you won't
have enough air to get through the
track.

She retraces the same steps and sings.

CELESTE

(sings along with the

recording of her own

voice)
Remember how things used to be?!
How good it felt in the back of
your car with your arms aro-und me?
Remember when you used to you loved
me?
Well, you can forget all that now
because I’m moving to the big
ci-ty.

CHOREOGRAPHER
Use your body to give your voice
emphasis when it needs it!

She takes four steps, turns.
CELESTE
(sings)
Remember! When you used to have me?
Well, hold on tight to that baby
cause now it’s just a memory.
INT. HOTEL ROOM - BATHROOM - NIGHT
MEDIUM ON -

CELESTE and ELEANOR do their make up in the mirror. They look
straight out of a William Eggleston picture.

CELESTE
Did you call mom?

ELEANOR
Yeah. I told her you were busy.

CELESTE
How’d she sound?
32.

ELEANOR
I don’t know. Kind of sad. She
misses us.

CELESTE
We are going to be home so soon
though.

ELEANOR

What if you get really big?

CELESTE
First of all, I don’t think that’s
even happening and second, even if
it did, it’s not like I wouldn’t
come back home all the time.

CELESTE turns to look at ELEANOR.
CELESTE (CONT'D)
Are you sure I’m gonna be able to
get in anywhere?

CELESTE keeps her face straight trying to present her “new
look” to ELEANOR.

ELEANOR

Totally. You look like you're 22.
CELESTE

No way.
ELEANOR

You do.

ELEANOR does a playful voice.

ELEANOR (CONT'D)
“Excuse me, sir, have you met my
baby sister? She’s so sexy isn’t

she?”

CELESTE
Shut up.

ELEANOR
It’s true.

SFX: A knock comes at the front door.

CELESTE exits.
33.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS
CELESTE enters frame and cracks open the door...

THE MANAGER
i got a call from that-

He whispers the next word.
THE MANAGER (CONT’D)
(whispers)
-bitch-
He continues in a normal voice.
THE MANAGER (CONT’D)
-we met with that you’1l want to
know about.

CELESTE
Is it bad?

THE MANAGER
are you gonna let me in?

CELESTE
Ellie’s getting dressed.

THE MANAGER stays in the doorframe.

THE MANAGER
they shopped it around to radio-

CELESTE
And what?!

THE MANAGER
(calm, collected)
-and we did it. Please Remember is
testing in the mid-nineties.

CELESTE
What about the other ones?

THE MANAGER furrows his brow.
THE MANAGER
they did fine i think but we only
needed one to work.

Beat.

THE MANAGER (CONT’D)
you don’t seem very excited.
34.

CELESTE
I am, I’m just overwhelmed, I
guess.

THE MANAGER
A & Ris gonna send through a list
of their acts they think you can
open for in the spring.

CELESTE
I can’t believe this. Oh my god.

THE MANAGER
listen, i’m gonna send you home for
a week or two and i want you to
rest up cause guess what? i’m
taking you to stockholm after the
break.

CELESTE
What?!

THE MANAGER
they want enough tracks for an
album and i want you working with
this guy. the best. you’d know his
stuff if you knew he wrote it. he’s
written everything - hits - andi
told him to make space for you. he
said okay if we come to him.

CELESTE
In Sweden?

THE MANAGER
whatever you got that’s half-
written, ideas, whatever you got.
let's go lay it down.

ELEANOR steps out of the bathroom, having washed all her make-
up off.

ELEANOR
See, I told you you would get
really big.
ELEANOR smiles a half moon.

HARD CUT TO:
35.

SUPER FAST MOTION (8 FPS) DIGITAL VIDEO MONTAGE OF
CELESTE AND ELEANOR’S TRIP TO SWEDEN SET TO THE
SCANDINAVIAN CHILDREN’S SONG, “DYRENE I AFRIKA.”

- The girls systematically test perfumes next to THE MANAGER
at duty free in an airport.

- Various shots of rain on the European motorway.
- Eleanor and Celeste sleep inside the van.

NARRATOR
Following a short visit home with
their parents, Celeste’s manager
had the girls’ passports expedited
and the three of them set flight
for an unfamiliar, if not
particularly exotic, foreign city
where they would go on to have many
uniquely first experiences...

- The girls arrive at Tor Erik’s studio, THE MANAGER makes
introductions.

- A series of various recording sessions...
- THE MANAGER sleeps on a couch.
- The sun rises and sets and rises and sets.

NARRATOR (CONT’D)
Producer, Tor Erik Romstad, was
initially skeptical but grew
increasingly infatuated with the
inseparable sisters; and though he
considered himself a beat up old
atheist that had been “phoning it
in” for some time in the pop music
game”, he found the girls’ kind-
hearted devotion to God, music, and
most importantly, one another, to
be altogether inspiring. Over the
course of seven weeks, he would
turn out some of his career’s most
addictive hooks and melodies.

- The girls pray before bed in their hotel room.
- The girls eat room service.

- The girls enter a bar.
36.

NARRATOR (CONT’D)
So far oblivious to the impending
deluge of notoriety these tracks
would soon afford her, Celeste
primarily enjoyed getting all this
one-on-one time with Ellie. She
never could have dreamed they would
one day casually travel to Europe
together, unsupervised and
unattended. On weekends, Eleanor
enjoyed playing the role of the big
sister by taking Celeste around to
the nearby bars and local dance
clubs. Before the massacre at
Ridgewood, Eleanor might never have
dared to share these more
disgraceful aspects of her
recreational appetites with her
young sibling, but considering all
the suffering Celeste had endured,
she was surely old enough now to
take part in the more pleasurable
parts of adulthood, also.

- The girls dance at a club.

- The girls ride on the back of two speeding motorbikes.
They clutch on to the helmeted young men who drive them.

- City lights streak the frame.

- The girls fuck two slightly older boys side-by-side on a
snow mound near a street lamp.

- A new angle on CELESTE’s expression under the light
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
Celeste felt alive, creative, and
autonomous - in command of her own
destiny.
INT. BATHROOM - MORNING
(Back to 65mm)
CELESTE vomits in the toilet.
SFX: A phone rings incessantly.
ELEANOR

He’s calling again. Baby, we're
gonna miss our flight.
37.

CELESTE
Tell him I don’t think I can get on
it.

ELEANOR
Yes, you can. I’11 take care of
you.

CELESTE rolls her body off the toilet and collapses into her
sister’s arms.

CELESTE
I feel so sick.

ELEANOR
You shouldn’t drink that much with
your medication. You’ll be all
right. Sometimes you just gotta
push it so far that it scares you
straight. It won’t happen again.

INT. TAXI - LATER

CELESTE and ELEANOR are a mess next to THE MANAGER scrunched
in the back of a taxi.

THE MANAGER
i can’t believe this shit.

CELESTE
I’m sorry. I’m really sorry.

ELEANOR
No, I’m sorry. It’s my fault.

THE MANAGER
don’t tell me you’re sorry just
don’t. do. it. it’s the same shit
with you kids over and over again.
your parents trusted me and i take
that seriously.

ELEANOR smiles.

THE MANAGER (CONT’D)
are you smiling? don’t smile at me.

ELEANOR
It’s just that you’re funny. Don’t
yell at me.
38.

THE MANAGER
i'll stop yelling when you wipe
that condescending beam off your
face. and guess what? since you
both have decided to completely
fuck off and do whatever you please
with zero consideration for what a
terrible position you have put me
in - morally, ethically, legally -
from now on i veto your request and
will swear and curse as much as i
please cause i’m not buying this
innocent little girl shit you two
are selling.

CELESTE
Fine, it’s a deal. Just stop
yelling.
He looks at his watch.
THE MANAGER
you have roughly 13 hours to get
your act together.

CELESTE
What happens in 13 hours?

THE MANAGER
i called the room ten times this
morning. you're going to la to make
a video.
CELESTE shoots up in her seat.
CELESTE
What?!
EXT. LAX AIRPORT - NIGHT
WIDE ON -—
Planes land like satellites falling from the stars.

Lights blink across the landing strip’s intersections.

HOLD ON THIS... HOLD, HOLD.

INT. ROCK VENUE BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

SFX: Hardcore punk music blares in the room downstairs.
39.

Backstage area is packed with 20 or so people in a room fit
for 5. CELESTE, ELEANOR, and the MANAGER are all among them.

LONG LENS ON -—

A lanky, British MUSICIAN, older than CELESTE, excuses
himself and walks over to talk to her. They shout to be heard
over the volume.

MUSICIAN
(shouts )
Did you like the show?

CELESTE is caught off-guard.

CELESTE
Oh, I’m sorry but we actually just
got off a plane and we missed it.
I’m with my manager

She points.

CELESTE (CONT'D)
He’s over there. He wanted to come
and say hi to someone.

MUSICIAN
That’s a shame. I think it went
well tonight.

CELESTE
What’s your band called?

MUSICIAN
We were called Apex but my brother
left the band so now we’re called
Boy Friend.

CELESTE
Boy Friend? Really?

MUSICIAN
You don’t like it?

CELESTE
No, I do.

MUSICIAN

We don’t know if we like it. Sounds
kind of quaint instead of
subversive or something. We just
picked it arbitrarily before coming
to a gig one night.
40.

There’s an awkward beat where young CELESTE doesn’t know how
to advance the conversation.

MUSICIAN (CONT’D)
Where are you coming from?

CELESTE
Oh, my sister and I are visiting
from back east. We are only here a
few days to make a video.

MUSICIAN
Are you in it?

CELESTE
I guess but I don’t really know
yet. They haven’t told me but it’s
a video for a song I made.

MUSICIAN
What kind of music do you make?!

CELESTE
I’m embarrassed to say.

MUSICIAN
Why?

CELESTE
Because I don’t want you to make
fun of me.

MUSICIAN
I’m not going to make fun of you!

CELESTE
Pop music.

MUSICIAN
I love pop music.

CELESTE
No you don’t!

MUSICIAN
Of course I do. Who doesn’t love
pop music?
INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - LATER

MUSICIAN leans heavy against CELESTE. She tries to open the
door with her key but it doesn’t work.
41.

MUSICIAN
Do you have any drugs in the room?

CELESTE
Only pain killers.

MUSICIAN
(laughs )
Okay.

CELESTE
I have to go downstairs and get a
new card. I think I grabbed my
sister’s key.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

HANDHELD ON -

It’s very dark. The faintest moonlight and city lights shine
off CELESTE’s skin. Nude, she performs the same choreography
we saw briefly earlier with her choreographer for the
MUSICIAN who cheers her on. The moment is warm and human.
She looks softer and more fragile here than previously.

MUSICIAN
This is brilliant!

CELESTE
Shut up!

MUSICIAN

You left out a drop and crawl.
CELESTE
(extremely bashful)
I’m not doing that.
Beat.

CELESTE (CONT'D)
You do it.

MUSICIAN
Fine, I will. Get off my stage.

MUSICIAN hops off the bed, also nude, and playfully drops,
crawls, and sloppily turns himself upside down.
42.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - LATER
SFX: Shostakovich mournfully underscores the scene.

CELESTE lies next to MUSICIAN. The necklace which covers the
scar on her throat gives her appearance a sci-fi quality: The
Woman Who Fell to Earth.

MUSICIAN is almost asleep in a dope haze. It gives a casual
air to the proceedings.

CELESTE
You make the same sort of music the
boy who attacked me used to listen

to.
MUSICIAN
Does that remind you of him?
CELESTE
It did just this moment.
MUSICIAN
I hope that doesn’t upset you too
much.
CELESTE

It doesn’t. I think that when you
meet someone who is going to become
important to you that it forces us
to look back at the past so we can
get on with the future is all.

MUSICIAN opens his eyes, thinks.

MUSICIAN
In our defense, maybe it was the
thing that pushed that kid over the
edge or maybe it was the only thing
that could have saved him and all
those other poor kids.

CELESTE’s expression darkens.

MUSICIAN (CONT’D)
Anyhow, I’m glad you think I’11l be
important to you.

CELESTE
I try not to think about it or talk
about it.
43.

MUSICIAN
Why would you? I mean, what is
there to talk about?

CELESTE smiles.

CELESTE
That's what I love about pop music,
I think. I don’t want anyone to
have to think too hard. I just
want them to feel good.... Put your
hand between my legs.

MUSICIAN responds.

He nods.

CELESTE (CONT'D)
Inside.

CELESTE (CONT'D)
(whispers)
Since last January, I have the same
dream every night.

MUSICIAN
Tell me.

CELESTE
In my dream, I am speeding through
a tunnel that won’t end.

MUSICIAN
You’re in a car?

CELESTE

No, it’s a motorbike - or maybe
it’s not but I am wearing a helmet
or something because my view is
through some sort of a mask - and
every time I turn these wide bends
in the road, I drive past a body
but I don’t stop for it.

MUSICIAN
A dead body?
44,

CELESTE

Not exactly but, lifeless - after
some time I realize that they are
these doubles of me, like clones,
that I’ve tried to send down the
tunnel in my place but they've
never made it to the end. They’re
not ever the same age and they’re
always laid out in a different
configuration.

MUSICIAN
That makes sense.

CELESTE
Does it?

He wakes up a bit.

MUSICIAN
Sure - you almost died so now it’s
easy to imagine yourself dead at
any age.

CELESTE
But in the dream I know that I will
never die.

MUSICIAN pushes into her deeper and makes a crude joke.

MUSICIAN
What’s at the end of the tunnel.

She laughs.

CELESTE
I always wake up before I get there
but I’m so frightened because I’m
going somewhere where no one can
find me and no one knows my name.

INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - EARLY THE NEXT MORNING

 

CELESTE exits an elevator and tiptoes down the hallway. As
she comes close to us, we see that tears stream down her
face. She looks pretty strung out.

CAMERA pans and follows her to the end of the hall.

She reaches her sister’s room and slips a key into the door.
45.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

She opens the door and freezes upon the sight of THE MANAGER,
naked, sleeping next to ELEANOR.

CELESTE stands a long beat looking at them then...

CELESTE
Guys, wake up.

They don’t respond.

CELESTE (CONT'D)
Please, you gotta wake up.

ELEANOR suddenly shoots up in bed.

ELEANOR

What are you doing in here?
CELESTE

I had your key. Where’s the

remote?
CELESTE searches the room feverishly for a remote control.

CELESTE (CONT'D)
You gotta turn on the news.

ELEANOR is completely out of it. She shouts...

ELEANOR
GET OUT OF HERE!

CELESTE
Where’s. the. remote? A plane just
crashed into a building in New
York.
EXT. TUNNEL - DAY
A motorcycle speeds through a tunnel.

After some time...

LOUDPSEAKER VOICE
Now, slow to 40-

NEW ANGLE —

A camera crew in a follow car tries to keep a steady pace
behind the motorcycle.
46.

CELESTE clutches a man on a motorcycle and she wears a very
distinctive mask.

CLOSE ON -

CELESTE’s face. She lip syncs through the open hole for the
mouth.

CELESTE

(sings)
Take me by the hand to where no one
knows my name.
Make me feel different tonight or
make me feel the same (as I used
to...)
But when I’m out on stage, it’s all
for you
When I can’t make the grade
I know who’s out there to pull me
through (through)
I’m sick and I’m tired of this
party (party)
All I can think is you and your
body (body)

INT. TUNNEL - LATER

For a new set-up, CELESTE now has her face revealed to camera
while a group of back-up dancers now wearing different
variations of the mask from the previous shot lunge towards
the center of the lens.

CELESTE

(lip syncs to playback)
(I keep singing)
One for the money!
two for the show!
on three we get ready and -
on four we go!
(I keep hearing)
One for the money!
two for the show!
on three we get ready and -
on four we go!

NEW ANGLE ON -

In profile, we TRACK LEFT with the camera crew and dance
troupe as they perform, lunging over and over again at the
camera and track set up in front of them. They each take
turns vying for the front position.
47.
From this angle each gesture seems lightly absurd.

FADE TO BLACK:

INSERT TITLE:

ACT I

EXT. BRAC BEACH RESORT - DAY
ULTRA WIDE PANORAMA ON —

Due to the uniform aesthetic of the striped umbrellas it
resembles the 1950’s but the beachwear suggests that actually
some years have passed.

After some time, a row of men dressed in masks enter the
frame and begin shooting at civilians.

It takes a moment for the crowd to react and understand.
People begin running for their lives. Most run directly into

the sea. Dozens are shot in the back and fall into the
water.

The scene is horrific, brutal.

INT. ATLANTIC CITY HOTEL - MORNING
STEADICAM ON —

THE MANAGER, older now, even more disheveled, walks briskly
down the hall of an upscale hotel.

A stylist and a few PA’s exit a room and nod at him as they
pass. He turns to look at them keeping up his pace.

THE MANAGER
where are you going?

STYLIST
For a cigarette. She’s with make-
up.

THE MANAGER
is she dressed?
48.

STYLIST
Hair wanted her before we start.

THE MANAGER
round tables are at 1.

STYLIST
That’s not on me. We started 40
minutes late.
THE MANAGER bites his lip.

THE MANAGER
how does she look?

STYLIST
Tired.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

A MAKE-UP ARTIST works on CELESTE who looks a bit worse for
wear. It’s clear from her matured features that at least 15
years have passed. She’s dressed in nude spanks with her hair
plastered down for a wig.

PROFILE ON -

CELESTE regards herself in the mirror.

CELESTE
What do you think?

MAKE-UP ARTIST
You look beautiful. I think it’s
enough of a statement with the
brows. I don’t want to keep fussing
with it too much.

CELESTE
(despondent)
Okay.
CELESTE lights up a cigarette. A knock comes at the door.

CELESTE (CONT'D)
Come in.

NEW ANGLE ON -

THE MANAGER enters...
49,

THE MANAGER
how‘’s it going in here?

MAKE-UP ARTIST
20 minutes away.

THE MANAGER
great. (Beat) celeste, i need to
speak with you before we start
today.

CELESTE
What is it?

THE MANAGER
it’s better in private.

CELESTE
Toni doesn’t care. What is it?

THE MANAGER gathers himself and speaks.

THE MANAGER
there’s a- shooting, they think
it’s terrorism, in a beach town
called brac in croatia.

CELESTE turns around in her chair.

CELESTE
We know someone who got hurt?

THE MANAGER
no, of course not. don’t worry. i
guess there’s not really a lot of
information yet but so far twenty
people are dead and-

CELESTE
Hey, we finally got our act
together; can’t cancel a show every
time something terrible happens
somewhere.

THE MANAGER opens his mouth to interrupt but fails to get a
word in.

CELESTE (CONT'D)

No, listen, whatever it is, no one
is going to think we are
insensitive for playing a gig
halfway around the world.
50.

THE MANAGER
it’s not that.

CELESTE
Who did it?

THE MANAGER
far as i know, nobody’s claimed
responsibility yet but let me
finish.

CELESTE braces herself.

CELESTE
Okay.

THE MANAGER
the attackers were all wearing
masks from our One For the Money
video.

CELESTE furrows her brow.

CELESTE
What?

THE MANAGER
these guys all came out in masks
and started shooting people at a
beach resort.

CELESTE
How similar?

THE MANAGER
what?

CELESTE
The masks.

THE MANAGER
i don’t know, the same ones, i
guess.

THE MANAGER runs his hands through his hair and shakes it
out.

CELESTE
Okay. (beat) Why?

He shrugs.
51.

THE MANAGER
that’s as much as I know. you’re
going to get a lot of questions
about it today and i want you to be
prepared.

CELESTE
Fuck me. I can’t believe this is
happening today.

BEAT. CELESTE thinks.

CELESTE (CONT'D)
Can we call off the press?

THE MANAGER
we can - but probably not without
calling off tonight, as well.

CELESTE
What a mess.

THE MANAGER
josie thinks it looks bad to avoid
it anyway. people are going to be
on your side. we just need to face
it head-on and be, ya know, astute
in our response. we’re making
arrangements now to hold a press
conference downstairs at 4.

CELESTE
A press conference!? Are you
kidding me?

THE MANAGER
it’ll be 5 minutes. i called josie
and told her i need her here with
us to prepare a statement. now.

INT. STAIRWELL/ CASINO / HOTEL LOBBY - LATER

 

STEADICAM ON —

CELESTE and her entourage walk briskly down a flight of
stairs and then through a casino.

CELESTE
Has anyone heard about Albertine?
My phone’s dead.
52.

THE MANAGER
albertine is in the restaurant
having lunch. i'm walking you to
see them right now.

CELESTE
Is she mad at me?

THE MANAGER
why would she be mad at you? she’s
excited to be here.

JOSIE, THE PUBLICIST
I pushed roundtables until after
press assembly so that hopefully
allows us time for a few more
details to pour in.

THE MANAGER
do I dare to ask if you’ve heard
anything else yet?

JOSIE, THE PUBLICIST
Not really. The gist I have so far
is that it might all be a
coincidence-

CELESTE
A coincidence, how?

JOSIE, THE PUBLICIST
(exhales )

I don’t know, they stopped at a
costume shop and picked up the
first disguise, or whatever you
want to call it, that they saw; but
now the article SRK sent over
speculates that it’s more likely
that the group-

THE MANAGER
the gunmen.

JOSIE nods.

JOSIE, THE PUBLICIST
-are exploiting your image and body
of work as a symbol of moral
corruption in the west or something
lunatic.
53.

THE MANAGER
given her history, i think we
really gotta try and view this as
an opportunity to address a few
important issues to celeste.

JOSIE, THE PUBLICIST
In all likelihood, “her history” is
half the reason they decided to
target her.

Then to CELESTE...

JOSIE, THE PUBLICIST (CONT’D)
You need to make it clear from the
outset that you’re not canceling
the show tonight or any upcoming
dates because there’s not enough
information yet to justify
canceling.

CELESTE is totally strung out, distracted by all the
commotion from the casino games and slot machines.

CELESTE
Which important issues to me? What
did you mean?

THE MANAGER
gun violence

CELESTE
In Brac? Come on, let’s not try and
see this as an “opportunity,” man.

THE MANAGER
don’t be nasty and sarcastic. i’m
not trying to gloss over what's
happened, celeste. we’re here to
protect you from getting hurt by
this in any way.

JOSIE, THE PUBLICIST
Keep it focused on your outpour of
love and mourning for the victims,
and victims of violence all over
the world.

CELESTE
Can I tell these guys to go fuck
themselves?
54.

JOSIE, THE PUBLICIST
Nobody’d blame you but don’t say
anything rash. I don’t want to
leave anyone in that room a way to
misconstrue what you’re really
trying to say.

They turn a corner.

JOSIE, THE PUBLICIST (CONT’D)
It’s terrible that you’ve gotten
dragged into this. Everyone out
there will feel for you. Just speak
from the heart.

CELESTE
I feel like I’m gonna throw up.

JOSIE, THE PUBLICIST
You want us to get you something?

CELESTE
No, it’s just my meds.

JOSIE, THE PUBLICIST
I’m gonna greet everyone and get us
set up in the banquet hall. I’1l
meet you back here in an hour.

THE MANAGER’s phone rings. They continue walking to the end
of the hall and make a left into the lobby.

THE MANAGER
hello.(beat) i know, i didn’t
forget but tell him I have to call
them back in the morning, my time.

She furiously searches for any sign of ALBERTINE.

CELESTE
Are they in the restaurant?

THE MANAGER
i don’t know, let me call them.
eleanor just said they were
“downstairs.”

CELESTE spots them off-screen.
CELESTE

Why didn’t you guys come up to the
green room?
55.

CAMERA WHIPS to reveal ELEANOR, a woman now, and ALBERTINE,
CELESTE’S 13 year-old DAUGHTER...

CELESTE (CONT'D)
Baby, you look so tired. Do you
want to come up to my room and take
a nap?

CELESTE reaches out to her daughter in a warm embrace.

ALBERTINE
No, I’m really hungry.

Closer now, ALBERTINE looks strikingly like CELESTE when she
was younger.

ELEANOR interjects...

ELEANOR
She wouldn’t eat anything I ordered
for her down here.

CELESTE
(to Albertine)
I don’t blame you. I had some room
service upstairs earlier. It’s
awful.

ALBERTINE
It’s not that. There was a lot of
turbulence. It made me feel sick.

CELESTE
Did you have fun with Aunt Ellie?

ELEANOR speaks to THE MANAGER. It’s awkward.

ELEANOR
I showed her around our hometown.

THE MANAGER
(to Albertine)
hey, nice seeing you, ladies.

CELESTE
Did you have a good time with
Grandma and Grandpa?

ALBERTINE
Yeah.

ELEANOR
How'd it go?
56.

CELESTE
What?

ELEANOR
The conference.

CELESTE seems like she’s almost already forgotten.

CELESTE
Haven't done it yet. Today’s a sick
kind of joke.

ELEANOR
(protective of Albertine)
I know but let’s not talk about it
now.

ALBERTINE
What’s wrong?

ELEANOR
None of your business. Grown up
problems. Don’t worry about it.

CELESTE
Do you want to have lunch with me,
honey?

CELESTE looks at ELEANOR and THE MANAGER.

CELESTE (CONT'D)
Can I take Albertine for a quick
solo girl’s lunch?

ELEANOR seems like the decision-maker.

ELEANOR
(to Albertine)
Of course, but I need you back by 4
so we can get dressed for mom's
show.
(to CELESTE)
We bought outfits for tonight.

He says to ELEANOR...

THE MANAGER
she’ll have her back by 3.30.

Then to CELESTE...
57.

THE MANAGER (CONT’D)
celeste, can you stick around the
hotel please? i have to go upstairs
and meet josie.

CELESTE
I need to get out of this place for
a bit, clear my head.

THE MANAGER looks like he’s about to explode.

THE MANAGER
fine. let me call the hotel’s head
of security and see if they can
pick you up.

CELESTE
We don’t need a babysitter. I’m
gonna walk Alby across the street
for some food. Relax.

THE MANAGER
across the street? please be back
before 3:30.

CELESTE throws a friendly arm around Albertine and starts
walking her away from ELEANOR and THE MANAGER.

NOTE: The following is in one uninterrupted sequence shot
until otherwise noted.

CELESTE
(To ELEANOR) Go take a nap. I/’11
bring her back to the room when
we're done.

CELESTE and ALBERTINE walk side-by-side through the lobby.
From this angle, they look they could be friends, the same
age.

CELESTE (CONT'D)
What do you want to eat?

ALBERTINE
I don’t know.

CELESTE
(messily)
What do you mean? Of course you
know. I hate talking to kids your
age now and they always say they
“don’t know” about everything. Are
you feeling depressed or what?
58.

ALBERTINE
No.

Some hotel guests seem to recognize CELESTE as she walks by.

CELESTE
I’m only teasing. Don’t listen to
me. Trying to get you to relax
around me.

ALBERTINE
I am relaxed. I’m just
uncomfortable because so many
people are looking at us.

CELESTE hasn’t noticed.

CELESTE
That’s why I want us to get out of
here. There’s gonna be cameras
outside cause everyone knows we’re
here. You wanna go around the
back.

ALBERTINE
No, I‘’1l just walk ahead of you.

ALBERTINE speeds up her pace and puts her head down as she
steps through the Hotel’s Front entrance.

CELESTE steps outside...

EXT. HOTEL / ATLANTIC CITY STRIP - CONTINUOUS

A team of photographers stand behind a barrier. CELESTE
walks by as quickly as she can.

PHOTOGRAPHERS
Celeste! Can you take a minute to
talk with us? Celeste!

CELESTE waves as she walks by and continues.

We follow her around the bend and she turns around to speak
to someone off-screen.

CELESTE
Hey man! Please don’t follow me.
I’m going to have lunch. I’1l be
back here in 45 minutes and you can
take as many pictures as you want.
Can you leave me alone?
59.

Suddenly an outburst...

CELESTE (CONT'D)
I’m serious, man, get away from me.

Beat. She looks back again.

CELESTE (CONT'D)
Thank YOU. Jeez.

The camera pans up to the stretch of Atlantic City skyline as
as we follow CELESTE for the length of the block until she
finally catches up with ALBERTINE.

CELESTE (CONT'D)
Hey, slow down.

ALBERTINE
I hate those people.

CELESTE
Everybody hates those people. Don’t
think about it. You should have let
‘em take your picture back there
cause you look so beautiful today.

ALBERTINE
No, I don’t. I just got off a
plane. I don’t have any make-up on.

CELESTE
Can I give ya some of mine? I
looked like a pterodactyl when I
woke up this morning.

ALBERTINE sort of laughs at the joke.

CELESTE (CONT'D)

That’s the thanks you get for
giving the gift of life. No good
deed, unpunished. Little babies
suck the life blood right out of
ya.

ALBERTINE
Shut up, you look great, mom.

CELESTE
Thank christ for that. I’m better
off than some of these other girls
I meet.

ALBERTINE
Like who?
ALBERTINE

60.

CELESTE
I’m not telling!

ALBERTINE
Why, what’s wrong with them?

CELESTE
Nothing really, I just mean when I
flip through magazines I see all
these girls I know and half the
time, I’ve seen them naked in a
dressing room or whatever so I know
where they have an ugly birthmark
or they got a tail cut off.

shoots her a look.

ALBERTINE
Who had a tail?

CELESTE
Don’t look so excited cause I’m not
telling you. I mean, come on, I
wouldn’t want anyone spreading that
kind of personal stuff about me
around.

They arrive at the restaurant and enter but camera stays
positioned outside and views much of the rest of the scene
through a window...

INT./ EXT.

DINER - AFTERNOON

CELESTE and ALBERTINE sit down at an empty cafe table
opposite one another.

Heavy traffic reflects off the glass in front of us
throughout the shot.

CELESTE
It’s nice to sit with someone who
doesn’t have their face buried in
their phone.

ALBERTINE
Ellie took my phone away.

CELESTE
Well, she was probably right to
take your phone away. That’s cool,
you should listen to her.
61.

ALBERTINE
If she’s so cool then why do you
hate having her around?

CELESTE
I don’t hate having her around. I
just wanted some alone time with
you.

ALBERTINE
You act like you hate her.

CELESTE
Don’t say ugly things like that.
That’s not true.

ALBERTINE
I’m not saying that you actually
hate her, I’m just saying you act
like it.

CELESTE
Well, sometimes I’ve got a short
fuse, you know, cause I don’t sleep
a lot and I’ve got a lot of stuff
on my plate. There’s no money in
music anymore. It’s all branded
content and Virtual Reality. I do
voices for a video game character
now for Christ’s sake, and I make
more money in an afternoon than all
year on tour.

ALBERTINE
Then why do you leave us and go on
tour for so long?

CELESTE blows a gasket but tries to keep a lid on it.

CELESTE
It’s a lot more complicated than
that. If I don’t keep up with the
times, the times leave without me,
you know, and I got a lot of people
to pay. More people than you can
imagine. It’s a full-time job. It’s
like I’m connected to the whole
world all the time. I can hear
everyone in my head.

ALBERTINE
I thought we were talking about
Aunt Ellie.
62.

CELESTE
What do you want to talk about? Is
she okay?

ALBERTINE
She’s upset you don’t ever try and
see her.

CELESTE

She told you this? That really
pisses me off that she’s bringing
our problems into my relationship
with you cause that has nothing to
do with you. You got that?

Nothing.

ALBERTINE
What problems do you have with her?
You have everything she ever
wanted.

CELESTE throws her hands up.

CELESTE
That’s ridiculous.

ALBERTINE
I’m serious. When we visited
Grandpa he even showed us this
video of her singing when you guys
were little and he kept calling her
Celeste. He was joking about it but
I could tell it just made her feel
bad.

CELESTE’s energy turns increasingly manic.

CELESTE
Hey, what can I say, your aunt has
too many scruples and sometimes
life just isn’t that fair.
Especially not nowadays.

CELESTE tries to come at her point from a different angle.

CELESTE (CONT'D)
People now will try and sell yaa
TV monitor that plain as day looks
like shit, but they call it
“ultra,” “mega,” “triple hi-def,”
whatever, and their business model
relies on their customer's
unshakable stupidity.

(MORE )
63.

CELESTE (CONT'D)
Deep down maybe we probably all
sense this - their intimate
knowledge of our commitment to the
lowest common denominator - but we
go along with it anyway.

CELESTE laughs.

ALBERTINE
Okay-

CELESTE

I mean, I’m pretty sure that every
year my videos look worse and worse
but they're doing better and
better. For example, they showed me
this perfume thing we shot last
year where I’m unfurling from a
digital rose petal like Thumbelina
and I thought it would ruin me! But
here I am opening for 70,000.

ALBERTINE
Mom, what are you even talking
about-

CELESTE lays down the law.

CELESTE
I’m letting you in on a secret
cause I love you, that’s what. It
doesn’t matter anymore if you're
Michelangelo or Michael & Angelo
from Ridgewood, you just need an
angle. And Aunt Ellie never found
an angle. She had her head in the
clouds and then she decided to be
jealous of my good fortune. She
made her own choices and let me
tell you, she could never do what I
do, day in and day out. Luckily,
she gets to go home to you every
night and she doesn’t have any real
life responsibilities because I
finance her entire life.

ALBERTINE
Be quiet.

CELESTE
Don’t tell me to be quiet.

ALBERTINE rolls her eyes.
64.

ALBERTINE
No, shh, I don’t mean it like
that... Isn’t that your song?

They stop and listen.

CELESTE
I’m sorry. Let me go ask them to
turn it off.

CELESTE stands and walks over to the bar. Camera pans with
her...

CELESTE (CONT'D)

Hey, can you turn that off please?
We’re about to order some lunch and
I'm trying to talk with my kid but
all I can hear is my voice inside
of my head.

BARTENDER
Yeah, sorry, my manager told me to
put it on.

CELESTE
It’s fine, listen, can you send me
over a drink and maybe a soda for
her?

BARTENDER
What would you like?

CELESTE
I don’t know, a glass of white wine
or something, whatever you have
that isn’t gross. And can you put
it in a plastic cup or something?

BARTENDER
Sure.

NOTE: End of sequence shot.
NEW ANGLE ON -

CAMERA inside the restaurant; CELESTE walks into CLOSE-UP and
sits down.

CELESTE
Hey, I’m sorry to rag so much on
Ellie. I know she’s doing her best.
I’m having a shit day and I’m
taking it out on her.
Beat.

65.

ALBERTINE
Better her than me.
CELESTE
I never take it out on you.
ALBERTINE
Okay.
CELESTE

I don’t, do I?

CELESTE (CONT'D)
Well, if I do, I don’t mean to.

CELESTE suddenly has tears in her eyes.

CELESTE (CONT'D)
Sometimes when you think it can’t
get any worse, you get diagnosed
with some freakin’ disease, you
know what I mean?

ALBERTINE shifts in her chair.

ALBERTINE
Are you sick, mom?

CELESTE wipes her face.

CELESTE
No, I don’t mean literally, I just
mean sometimes you get kicked when
you're down.

CELESTE can’t stop crying.

CELESTE (CONT'D)
I’m sorry. I shouldn’t do this in
front of you.

ALBERTINE
It’s fine.

CELESTE
(forces a smile)
No, it’s not. I'd slap me in the
face if I was sitting across from
me right now.

ALBERTINE
Really, it’s fine.
66.

CELESTE exhales and dramatically delivers.

CELESTE
Dan left me.

ALBERTINE
I know. I read about it.

CELESTE furrows her brow.

CELESTE
You read about it?! Aunt Ellie’s
not supposed to let you read all
that gossip shit.

ALBERTINE
She can’t control everything I do
like a watchdog.

CELESTE
Yeah, but I just wanted to be the
one to tell you. I feel like big
moments keep getting stolen away
from me.

ALBERTINE
Mom. It’s fine. I don’t care. I
don’t care about that guy.

CELESTE looks shocked.

CELESTE
I thought you loved Dan.

ALBERTINE
He was fine. I was just nice to
him because he was nice to you.

A SERVER enters with CELESTE and ALBERTINE’s drinks.

SERVER
Here you are. Have you decided on
something to eat?

CELESTE tries not to look up and let him see she’s crying.

CELESTE
I think we need another second with
the menu. Thanks.

ALBERTINE
I just want the pasta with
marinara.
SERVER
You want me to put that in now or
want me to wait?

CELESTE
It’s fine, I don’t need anything.
Just bring her some pasta.

The server walks away.

ALBERTINE
Why did he leave you?

CELESTE
Who said he left me?

ALBERTINE
You did.

CELESTE

Well, he didn’t. We left each other
because if you love something you
give it away.

ALBERTINE
Was he seeing someone else?

CELESTE
Is that what you read?

ALBERTINE
Yeah, it said he started dating
some rich girl.

CELESTE
I don’t know. If he is, he didn’t
tell me about it. I’m sure it’s
just a fling. I’ve had flings too
that I don’t want anyone to define
my character by.

The RESTAURANT MANAGER suddenly interrupts the flow of

conversation.
CELESTE keeps her face down.

RESTAURANT MANAGER
Drinks okay?

CELESTE
Yes, thank you.
68.

RESTAURANT MANAGER
I’m the manager here so let me know
personally if you need anything.

CELESTE
Will do, thanks.

BEAT. He doesn’t go away.

RESTAURANT MANAGER
You mind if I get a quick picture
with you?

CELESTE
I’m sorry but now’s not a great
time.

RESTAURANT MANAGER
It’s not for public use or
anything. Just for me. It will only
take a minute.

CELESTE finally looks up at him defiantly revealing the
smeared make-up from her tears.

CELESTE
Is this really what you want a
picture with? I’m trying to talk
with my daughter.

RESTAURANT MANAGER
I’m sorry but you really don’t have
to use that tone with me. I think I
asked you very nicely.

ALBERTINE
Let’s just go.

Without warning, CELESTE suddenly slams her hands on the
table.

RESTAURANT MANAGER
Alright, m’am. I was trying to be
friendly with you but now I’m going
to have to ask you to leave the
restaurant.

CELESTE
Are you fucking serious, man?

RESTAURANT MANAGER
Please don’t use that language with
me.
69.

CELESTE stands and gets in his face.

CELESTE
How dare you, motherfucker.

The RESTAURANT MANAGER calls over to the SERVER.

RESTAURANT MANAGER
Ally, can you call the cops please.

CELESTE
Who the fuck do you think you are.

RESTAURANT MANAGER
I was about to ask you the same
thing. I can smell that you have
alcohol on your breath, miss, so I
won't take this personally.

CELESTE
Are you trying to embarrass me in
front of my daughter.

RESTAURANT MANAGER
I didn’t even know you had a
daughter. I just came over to be
friendly and then you started
shouting at me and now I’m telling
you to leave my restaurant or I’m
calling the cops.

ALBERTINE
Please, let’s go!

CELESTE considers her options and then turns exits the
restaurant with ALBERTINE.

CELESTE
(on the way out)
You should be ashamed of yourself,
prick.

The door shuts.

RESTAURANT MANAGER
No, you should be ashamed, miss.

The RESTAURANT MANAGER turns to his staff members.
RESTAURANT MANAGER (CONT’D)

Can you believe that crazy bitch?
Mike, did you get that on camera?
70.

EXT. ATLANTIC CITY STRIP - MOMENTS LATER

 

SFX: Richard Wagner’s Rienzi Cverture underscores the scene.
It violently fights the wind, conversation, and traffic
outside.

STEADICAM ON —

We follow CELESTE who has her arms wrapped ALBERTINE’s
shoulders.

CELESTE
Let’s make a right here and go
around the back so we don’t have to
deal with all those shitheads out
front.

They turn right and walk... Beat.

CELESTE (CONT'D)
I’m really sorry I lost my cool
with that guy.

ALBERTINE
He was asking for it but I don’t
want to talk about it.

CELESTE
You seem shook up. That kind of
thing doesn’t happen all the time,
you know, but sometimes it does and
I gotta protect myself.

ALBERTINE
I said I don’t want to talk about
it.

CELESTE

But baby, we gotta talk about it,
otherwise, it’s just gonna hang in
the air. Why don’t you want to talk
to me?

ALBERTINE sulks.
CELESTE (CONT'D)
You got tears in your eyes. Come

on, what is it?

ALBERTINE’s voice cracks with heartbreak but they never stop
walking.
ALBERTINE

71.

ALBERTINE
(shattered)
I’m worried about you!

CELESTE
Worried about me?! Come on, you
don’t need to worry about ME. I’m
solid. I worry about YOU. That’s
my job, to worry about you.

shakes her head.

ALBERTINE
You’re skinnier than I am.

CELESTE
That’s cause I’m in great shape
from going out and dancing my ass
off every night.

CELESTE squeezes her close. ALBERTINE wipes some tears off

her face.

CELESTE (CONT'D)
Come on, baby. You’re breaking my
heart. Listen up, what that guy
said about me having alcohol on my
breath; that was a terrible thing
to imply in front of you and
instead of just ignoring the
elephant in the room, we need to
talk about it, head-on.

CELESTE finds the words...

CELESTE (CONT'D)
I ordered a glass of wine from them
in a plastic cup cause I needed to
let go of some tension I’m having
about tonight and I didn’t want you
to think there was anything to
worry about. I swear on your life I
wasn’t drinking before that today.
You don’t need to worry about stuff
like that, okay?

The girls continue their walk and talk down the boulevard as
diegetic sound fades out and the NARRATOR takes over.
72.

NARRATOR (0.S.)

In 2011, Celeste had drunk herself
blind, or more precisely, blind in
one eye, but had waited to tell a
physician about the trouble she’d
been having, too embarrassed to
explain that while touring the less
inhabited, and therefore less
inhibited, parts of the southern
United States, she had managed to
damage the optic nerve in her left
eye by ingesting various forms of
methanol during a stint of binge
drinking household cleaning
products across three state lines.
Shortly thereafter, when back at
home, she found herself at the
center of a very public dispute
over a traffic collision and one
pedestrian’s crushed left leg and
pelvis.

The girls continue to walk and comfort each other.

NARRATOR (CONT’D)
The victim of this short-lived
episode in her life saw an
opportunity and seized it. That
golden ticket came in the form of a
nearly seventeen million dollar
settlement which was to remain for
all intents and purposes, under the
table. All just another flame in
the crowd of what Celeste perceived
a decade-long witch hunt. Whatever
it was, Celeste needed something
big to pull her out of this mess, a
show that could put Ellie,
Albertine, and herself back on
track.

ALBERTINE looks like she’s starting to let CELESTE cheer her
up.
Diegtic sound resumes for a moment...

CELESTE

What is it? You got something else
on your mind?

ALBERTINE
It’s nothing.
73.

CELESTE
Stop it. What is it?

Diegtic sound fades out and the narrator resumes...

NARRATOR
Albertine had lost her virginity
the weekend prior to leaving for
this first unveiling of Celeste’s
6th studio recording, Vox Lux, in
Atlantic City, and yearned to share
the galvanizing details with her
mother. She had made herself sick
with anticipation every day since
and looked forward to the initial
shock or sense of failure it might
inspire in Celeste whom, albeit, no
stranger to crimes of passion in
her youth, had always spoken
severely of young men; even warning
of them more than mixing uppers
with downers, for example.

The girls turn a corner into the backlot of the hotel where
security stands already anticipating CELESTE’s re-entrance.

NARRATOR (CONT’D)

If all went according to plan, the
news might just strike up a long-
misplaced maternal instinct and
Celeste would be forced to act as
her confidant.

INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - LATER

ELEANOR answers the door to CELESTE.

ELEANOR
That was a fast-

ELEANOR sees that ALBERTINE isn’t with CELESTE.

ELEANOR (CONT'D)
Where’s Albertine?

CELESTE pushes past ELEANOR into the room.

INT. ELEANOR’S HOTEL ROOM - LATER

CELESTE paces circles around ELEANOR. She occasionally slurs
and stutters through her rant.
74.

CELESTE
I have her upstairs in my room
taking a pregnancy test cause
apparently you’re so fucking
incompetent that you let my
daughter get fucked by some hick
from town.

ELEANOR
She’s pregnant?

CELESTE throws her hands up.

CELESTE
Unless she’s as unlucky as me then
probably not but I want her to feel
the unease of waiting for the
results to come in because a
parent, or legal guardian,
disciplines the kid, doesn’t just
hang out with them.

ELEANOR
I’m sorry. I had no idea.

CELESTE
You fucked up.

CELESTE holds up two fingers.

CELESTE (CONT'D)
Twice.

ELEANOR
I know you’re mad but-

CELESTE
How could I be so stupid?! If you
did so badly with me how could I
ever expect you to do right by her.

ELEANOR stammers...
ELEANOR
I knew she was seeing a guy but it
didn’t seem physical, I swear.

CELESTE
Are you a retard?

ELEANOR
No.
CELESTE
(slowly)
Ya know, Ellie, sometimes your jaw
slacks in this certain way like
your life is just happening to you
and you just look like a retard.

ELEANOR blinks, not sure how to respond. Tears stream down

her face.

ELEANOR
Don’t say that about me.

CELESTE
Only crazy people get aggravated
when you call them crazy so you
must really be retarded.

ELEANOR
After everything I’ve done for you,
how can you hate me so much?

CELESTE
Is that the kind of garbage you've
been filling her head with? She
told me all the shit you’ve been
putting on her shoulders.

CELESTE uses two fingers to press the middle of ELEANOR’s

skull.

CELESTE (CONT'D)
You have that hapless look like
dad.

ELEANOR sits down in a chair and sobs.
HOLD ON THIS...

CELESTE (CONT'D)
I have a press conference then two
hours of round tables but I swear
to God, Ellie, if my daughter comes
back to me with that cross-eyed
Guido’s kitten litter or Hepatitis
Z, I'll throw you off that balcony.

ELEANOR wipes the tears from her face.
ELEANOR
If you threaten me ever again, I'll
tell everyone I write your songs.

CELESTE chews her jaw.
76.

CELESTE
Today I’d say that’s a stock you
don't want to buy into.

INT. HOTEL ROOM / MAKE-UP - LATER
A team of make- and hairstylists reset CELESTE’s face.

The STYLIST walks over with a new blouse for her to change
into...

STYLIST
Here you go, dear. That’s better.

THE MANAGER hovers around her, checking her out.

THE MANAGER
you look amazing. keep it simple.
you’re gonna do great.

He squeezes her shoulders.

INT. PRESS ROOM - CONTINUOUS

CLOSE ON -

CELESTE is on-stage in front of a packed press room.
Flashbulbs are blinding.

CELESTE
First I’d like to say that I have..
an outpour of love for victims of
this tragedy and victims of
violence all over the world and I
am deeply saddened to be associated
with such an obscene and
unnecessary tragedy... It’s a weird
time we live in, and I guess, no
matter how much we try and ignore
these things that are really
happening around us, they always
find a way to creep in.

PRESS 1 (0.S.)
Jennifer Durst, WYNN NY, why do you
think they targeted you? Do you
assume there’s a connection to
Ridgewood?
77.

CELESTE
No idea. I pretty much know as much
as you so far, and since nobody's
coming out and saying “we did this”
yet, I'd really prefer not to
speculate too much - but if they
did pick that “disguise” on purpose
I guess it’s cause they don’t like
that I’m a woman or that I’ma
successful woman. Maybe they don’t
like that I had a kid when I was a
kid. Maybe they think I’m a floozy.
But I guess some of you think that
too.

CELESTE shrugs and smiles.

CELESTE (CONT'D)
The way I have chosen to live my
life goes against some people’s
views about things.

PRESS 1 (0.S.)
Are there any links between you and
central Europe?

CELESTE
I mean, not really. Not that I
know of. I’ve never played there so
I really don’t know.

MODERATOR chimes in.

MODERATOR (0.S.)
Next question... There, at the
back.

PRESS 1
Sorry, I just have one more. Are
you and the band still going
forward with the show tonight?

CELESTE
There’s really not enough
information yet for us to justify
canceling and my dad always says,
“never postpone joy,” so yeah, I'll
play if they let me.

CELESTE smiles and shrugs.
78.

PRESS 2 (0.S.)
Afternoon, Meredith Desh, Atlantic
City, Greater NorthEast, do you
have anything you wish to
communicate to the perpetrators of
today’s attack?

There’s a LONG BEAT...
Hold on CELESTE. Bulbs flash over and over again.

CELESTE
(especially nonchalant)
Yeah, I’d like to tell them that
when I was a little girl I used to
believe in God too...

The statement hangs in the air.

CELESTE (CONT'D)
-and if they ever come to their
senses and they'd like something
new to believe in, they can start
believing in me cause I’m the new
faith and I’m not afraid of them.
Hell, I’d even like to extend an
invite to my show tonight. I’1l be
sure to put “cowards in masks” on
the guest list.

PRESS 2
I’m sorry but can you clarify what
you mean exactly?
ANGLE ON -

JOSIE and THE MANAGER bury their faces in their hands as arms
shoot up for further questioning.

BACK TO -

CELESTE.
CELESTE

I don’t know. I’m just making a
quip.

INT. ELEVATOR / HOTEL HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

 

CELESTE and her team are packed into an elevator.
79.

THE MANAGER
are you out of your fucking mind?

CELESTE
I don’t want to talk about it.

THE MANAGER
we coached you on what to say and
you said... the opposite. why the
fuck would you start spewing all
that weird shit out of your mouth?

CELESTE
You give it a try sometime. I was
nervous.

THE MANAGER
i’m pretty certain if i follow, and
correct me if i’m wrong, you
compared yourself to some sort of a
demigod and invited a group of
terrorists to your fucking concert
tonight.

CELESTE
Don’t give them so much credit,
anyway, it was a joke.

THE MANAGER
not exactly how I think our
sponsors are going to see it. do
you actually believe that weird
shit you said up there?

CELESTE
They wanted a show, I gave ‘ema
show.

They arrive at their floor and step out.
JOSIE, THE PUBLICIST
Alright, this place is swarming
with press. Can I kindly ask you
both to keep your mouths shut until
we are finished?
CELESTE winks at JOSIE.

CELESTE
Fine by me.

JOSIE says to THE MANAGER.
80.

JOSIE, THE PUBLICIST
Let me handle it. Go smoke a
cigarette or something.

INT. HOTEL ROOM / ROUND TABLES - LATER

 

JOSIE enters with CELESTE and tells the group...

CELESTE
(tongue in cheek)
hello everybody.

CELESTE seems even more strung out than before.

She sits down in front of four journalists and various
recording devices set up in front of her chair.

JOSIE, THE PUBLICIST
You have ten minutes, and as we
currently have no more information
regarding what’s happening across
the Atlantic right now, I’d kindly
like to ask everyone to keep the
questions to tonight’s performance
and the new album now as much as
possible.

JOSIE turns and exits.
One journalist leads the charge.

JOURNALIST
Well, on that note then, can you
tell us what audiences can expect
from the new album?

CELESTE
Sci-fi anthems. The concept with
this one was to create an
experience as relentless and
addictive as possible.

A second JOURNALIST joins in...

JOURNALIST 2
I know we’ve just been asked to not
talk about today’s attack but I
guess I can’t help but let it
contextualize my next question.

CELESTE
Okay...
81.

CELESTE bites her lip.

JOURNALIST 2
It just got me thinking, do you
feel that there’s been a shift in
the culture where nihilist radical
groups like this are increasingly
keen on being perceived as
superstars themselves?

CELESTE is suddenly lucid and precise in her language.

The group

CELESTE
I mean, who cares? I was hesitant
to even give a statement today
because all these ultra-violent
thugs want is to make headlines. If
everyone paid them no attention,
they'd cease to exist - and so
would people like me. That’s the
only link I see between them and
superstars.

looks a little baffled by her digression.
CELESTE (CONT'D)

-but I couldn’t just ignore the
casualties, ya know. Makes me sick.

JOURNALIST 2 writes down her statement.

JOURNALIST 2
Thanks for your answer, appreciate
your candidness.

JOURNALIST
From the public’s perspective, this
has been an-

The JOURNALIST chooses his words.

JOURNALIST (CONT’D)
-emotional few years for you,
bizarre events today very much
included. Can you shed light on the
significance of these upcoming
arena performances for you
personally?

CELESTE
This is the culmination of my
life’s work so far. You know, we
worked on it for two years before
bringing it to the public.
82.

JOURNALIST
Why two years?

CELESTE
Year before that I was under a lot
of stress after my accident-

CELESTE smiles a bashful grin.

CELESTE (CONT'D)
-and it’s an expensive event to put
on, and we also waited on all the
best people to become available to
help us make it happen. I wanted
all my best dancers back.

JOURNALIST
So, you consider these events a
resurgence since the accident and
arrest for “causing serious injury
by dangerous driving?”

CELESTE blinks.

CELESTE
Injury, not serious injury. I never
stopped making music so I don’t
consider it a “resurgence.” I just
wanted to channel all that anxiety
and suffering into something
tangible, something positive.

JOURNALIST
Can you shed any light on why the
case was abruptly dropped-

LONG BEAT.

CELESTE
I see what you’re doing.

JOURNALIST
You brought it up.

CELESTE
Don’t try and have me say
“abruptly” anything.

CELESTE laughs and lights a cigarette.

CELESTE (CONT'D)
There are three classifications of
gunshot wounds to the spine.

(MORE )
83.

CELESTE (CONT'D)

I’m type three which is when the
bullet is actually inside the
intervertebral disc space. Now,
type three injuries are subdivided
into (A) spinal lesion not
associated with perforation of
abdominal viscera or (B) injury
with perforation of abdominal
organs. Thankfully, I’m type A.,
but it’s no secret to anybody that
I take meds for my injury and that
I never shoulda been behind the
wheel of a car that night.

CELESTE exhales and calls out for JOSIE.

CELESTE (CONT'D)
Josie!

JOURNALIST
I didn’t mean to upset you.

CELESTE
People used to talk about me like I
was a hero and then all the sudden,
I was lower than trailer trash.
That’s what this show’s about; a
rebirth.

JOSIE, THE PUBLICIST enters the room to stop the interview.

JOSIE, THE PUBLICIST
Time’s up.

JOURNALIST
Have you been at all in contact
with the victim, Mr. Joel Hedlund?
CELESTE furrows her brow, suspicious.

JOSIE, THE PUBLICIST
Okay, that’s enough.

CELESTE

I said I can’t talk about it.
JOURNALIST

I thought we were talking about it

just now.

JOSIE grabs CELESTE.
84.

JOSIE, THE PUBLICIST
Does it not seem like an
insensitive time to be bringing
this up? I’ve had it. You and I are
through, Tommy. I’m sick of this
kinda shit from you.

JOURNALIST
I'm doing my job, Josie.
CELESTE
This guy’s trying to kick me while

I’m down.

JOSIE, THE PUBLICIST
Celeste, stop, this is over.

JOURNALIST
That’s not what I’m trying to do.
I’m sorry you've misunderstood.

CELESTE
Why don’t you go and write about
what happened to those innocent
people today instead of trying to
tear me down.

INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
STEAICAM ON -

We follow JOSIE and CELESTE as they walk briskly down the
hall towards the stairwell. They pass several journalists
sitting in folding chairs who are patiently waiting their
turn for 10 minutes with CELESTE.

JOSIE, THE PUBLICIST
I’m standing everything down until
after the show. I want you to go to
your room and get some rest. SOME
REST, okay? I’m serious. I’1l come
get you at 6.30. What floor are you
on?

CELESTE
One floor up. 1823.

INT. CELESTE’S SUITE - MOMENTS LATER

 

CELESTE enters to find THE MANAGER and ALBERTINE posed
against her suite’s beachfront view in the middle of an
embrace.
85.

CELESTE
Get your hands off her.

THE MANAGER squints his brow and lifts his hands from
ALBERTINE.

THE MANAGER
i came in here and she was crying
by herself. she needed a hug.

CELESTE speaks only to ALBERTINE.

CELESTE
Go downstairs and get ready for the
show.

ALBERTINE starts to rush past CELESTE but CELESTE catches
her.

CELESTE (CONT'D)
Come on, don’t do that.

She whispers...

CELESTE (CONT'D)
I hope you didn’t take that thing I
gave you. I over-reacted.

ALBERTINE doesn’t respond.

CELESTE (CONT'D)
What? You want me to shout it from
the rooftops?

She pinches her daughter's side.

CELESTE (CONT'D)
I’m just not ready for you to grow
up is all. You’re my little girl.
Forgive me?

ALBERTINE sort of smiles and nods her head.

CELESTE (CONT'D)
Hold on a minute.

CELESTE grabs a bouquet of flowers from a vase in her room
and sets them next to some hotel stationary where she jots
down a crudely written “I’m sorry I was a bitch” and sets
it on a rose.

CELESTE (CONT'D)
Give these to Ellie.
86.

She shoves the bouquet at ALBERTINE.

ALBERTINE
What’s this for?

CELESTE
For everything. Take them down and
I‘1l meet you guys in the lobby.
We'll head over together. I love
you.

ALBERTINE
Yeah, me too.

ALBERTINE kisses her mom and exits...

THE MANAGER (0.S.)
why aren't you with Josie?

CELESTE is almost startled.

CELESTE
Jesus. I almost forgot you were
standing there.

CAMERA pans over to THE MANAGER.

CELESTE (CONT'D)
Josie called off the rest of the
day. Some guy was coming after me
about Joel Hedlund and I just
didn’t have the mental capacity or
balls to take him on.

THE MANAGER
christ. i'll go talk her off her a
ledge.

CELESTE
No. Stay with me.

CELESTE sits down with her legs spread across from THE
MANAGER.

CELESTE (CONT'D)
You got any stuff left from last
night?

THE MANAGER
you think that’s a good idea right
now?
87.

CELESTE
(frank, matter-of-fact)
I’m done yammering for the day.

THE MANAGER raises his eyebrows.

CELESTE (CONT'D)

What? Tonight’s second nature. I
gotta get out of my head, you know
that. I’m getting myself all worked
up from over-thinking everything. I
keep picturing all those people
screaming and running all over the
sand.

THE MANAGER exhales, unsure.

CELESTE (CONT'D)

Come on, let’s just take what you
have left. We won’t call for more
until after the show and you can
fuck me for a little while we’re
high.

CELESTE comically holds her hand up for a high five. THE
MANAGER laughs, give her a high-five, then holds onto her
hand. In a way, they really love each other.

INT. HALLWAY - LATER

THE MANAGER exits holding the door open for CELESTE who is in
some fancy new wardrobe but looks obliterated.

THE MANAGER
Come on, everyone’s downstairs.

CELESTE trips out of the door, falls straight on her face.
THE MANAGER (CONT’D)
(deadpan)
You alright?

INT. VAN - EVENING

CELESTE seems almost dead in the backseat. ELEANOR,
ALBERTINE, JOSIE, and THE MANAGER are all there, as well.

Suddenly, CELESTE pops up to exclaim...

CELESTE
Stop the car!
88.
THE MANAGER
We’re running late.

CELESTE
Just pull over for 2 minutes.

JOSIE, THE PUBLICIST
What is it?

CELESTE
I just need to do something for 2
minutes. Stop the fucking car!
EXT. VAN / BEACH - CONTINUOUS
The van pulls over and CELESTE jumps out.
CELESTE
Honey, come with me for a sec.
EXT. BEACH - MOMENTS LATER

ALBERTINE and CELESTE run up to the water and CELESTE kneels
down.

CELESTE
(to Albertine)
Get down with me.

ALBERTINE is concerned.

ALBERTINE
What are you doing
CELESTE
Let’s just have a moment of silence

together.
ALBERTINE cautiously kneels down.
CELESTE (CONT'D)
Let’s shut our eyes and hold
everyone who's suffering right now
in our hearts.
ALBERTINE shuts her eyes...
NEW ANGLE ON -

The water.
89.

EXT. ATLANTIC CITY STRIP - EVENING

A sign rotates advertising Celeste’s residence. The
advertisement boasts-

“CELESTE & THE DIRTY THIRTY PRESENTS VOX
LUX: LIVE”

EXT. BACKSTAGE LOT - CONTINUOUS

SFX: Constant percussion rises and falls in the mix.
Occasionally blending with the pre-show recordings inside the
auditorium.

A security team awaits CELESTE’S arrival. After some time, a
van pulls up and CELESTE and her entourage exit the vehicle.
JOSIE has to help CELESTE out of the sliding door.

FRANTIC HANDHELD ON -

A PA speaks up...

PA
Can I help you Ms. Montgomery?

CELESTE
No one calls me that.

JOSIE, THE PUBLICIST
Give her some space. Are there
cameras back there?

PA
Not that I know of.

JOSIE, THE PUBLICIST
Tell your team if anyone is caught
taking a picture of her, they’re
fucking fired.
JOSIE turns her attention to CELESTE

JOSIE, THE PUBLICIST (CONT’D)
What can we get you?

CELESTE
I'm so thirsty.

JOSIE turns to the PA.
90.

JOSIE, THE PUBLICIST
Get her some sparkling water and
something to eat.

PA
Oh, sure, like what?

JOSIE, ELEANOR, and THE MANAGER are nearly dragging her into
the back entrance of the auditorium.

JOSIE, THE PUBLICIST
Something with sugar.

CELESTE
Where’s Albertine?
ELEANOR
She's behind you.
CELESTE
Take her to get something to drink.
ALBERTINE
We're not leaving you. I’m right

here.
CELESTE looks behind her to see ALBERTINE.
CELESTE
There you are. Don’t look so upset.

Just go and get something to drink
and get your seat.

INT. AUDITORIUM HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

 

CELESTE’s LASER DIRECTOR greets her at the door.

LASER DIRECTOR
I just needed to quickly introduce
myself. I’m stepping in for
O'Malley tonight.

CELESTE looks at him but doesn’t respond.

JOSIE, THE PUBLICIST
Now’s not a great time.

The LASER DIRECTOR suddenly sees what terrible shape she’s
in.

LASER DIRECTOR
Oh, sorry.
91.

CELESTE’s eyes focus...

CELESTE
Who’s O’Malley?

LASER DIRECTOR
Your laser director.

CELESTE
I’ve never met him. What happened
to him?

LASER DIRECTOR
He’s got a throat infection

CELESTE
-but this is the first show.

JOSIE cuts him off..

JOSIE, THE PUBLICIST
I said now isn’t a good time!

They keep walking. JOSIE looks across to THE MANAGER who has
yet to say a word.

JOSIE, THE PUBLICIST (CONT’D)
I need you to call this RIGHT NOW
if she can’t go on.

THE MANAGER
she’s fine. (to Celeste) stop with
the histrionics, baby.

The PA walks ahead trying to make way for them.
PA
There’s a room prepared just here
on the left.
The PA dictates a door on the left.
CELESTE
(shouts )
I KNOW! We’ve been here every day
for a week.

CELESTE shakes everyone loose.

CELESTE (CONT'D)
Let go of me.

She braces herself against the doorframe. They enter the
room.
92.

CELESTE (CONT'D)
Everyone thinks I’m an idiot.

ELEANOR
No one thinks you’re an idiot.

CELESTE
(slurs)
Just, shut up-

THE MANAGER
don't be a spoiled brat. you’re
embarrassing yourself.

CELESTE
(shouts )
Don’t call me brat!

ELEANOR says to JOSIE.

ELEANOR
Get her out of here.

Then to ALBERTINE. CELESTE shouts and rants behind her.

CELESTE
(belligerent shouting)
I'm sick of everyone talking about
me like I’m not a person! I’m not
just a thing you can put on and
wear!

ELEANOR
Baby, your mom needs me right now
and I need you to go with Josie.
I’1l1 come out to you as soon as I
can. Can you do that for me? I
promise you everything is going to
be all right, okay?

ALBERTINE
Okay.

ELEANOR
Okay.

ELEANOR shuts the door on the gang, leaving only CELESTE and
THE MANAGER with her in the room.

THE MANAGER
don’t feed into this unhealthy
behavior, ellie.

Then to Celeste, suddenly belligerent...
THE MANAGER (CONT’D)
i’m sick and i’m tired of you
treating us like we’re not a
person. how about that? at least
everyone is out there talking and
worrying about you, spoiled brat.
no one will ever drum up a thing to
say about the rest of us, spoiled
brat, and i don’t sit around
whining about it.

ELEANOR
You too. GET OUT OF HERE!

CELESTE is an outright mess, sobbing and dazed.

THE MANAGER
seriously, she’ll be fine. she’s
riding a bad wave that she’1l
eventually come off of. we just
need to snap some sense into her

Then back to Celeste, he says...

THE MANAGER (CONT'D)
you're in a hole, isn’t that right,
cel?

CELESTE has ceased to make much sense.

CELESTE
You can’t just press a button and
take out your dishes!

THE MANAGER
okay, i think you’re really scaring
everyone so you gotta just shut
your eyes and pretend you’re the
only one in the room. can you do
that for me?

ELEANOR
I said get out.

THE MANAGER doesn’t budge.

ELEANOR (CONT'D)
Do you want me to call this off?

He exhales, kisses CELESTE on the forehead and exits.
94,

CELESTE
Everyone is talking about me like
I’m not a person right in front of
them! They’re right in front of me
when they do it!

ELEANOR holds CELESTE to her chest. CELESTE is an outright
mess, sobbing and dazed.

ELEANOR
He’s a car salesman. Forget about
him.

CELESTE

Ellie, they showed me these promos
we shot and I looked so bad.

ELEANOR
What are you talking about?

CELESTE
No, don’t look at me like that,
listen to me. They shot me with
this new camera everyone told me is
great but I looked so ugly. It made
me want to die, Ellie.

ELEANOR seems possessed.

ELEANOR
You're not gonna die.

CELESTE
I just want to be queen for them
and sometimes I don’t feel like a
queen at all, ya know? I’m so ugly
underneath all this and if they
only knew-

CELESTE cries with her eyes rolled back in her skull.
ELEANOR
I’m so grateful you're alive and
I'm here and I’m not going
anywhere. Ever.
CELESTE has her face buried in her sister’s neck.
CELESTE
But the journalists can be so mean,

Ellie.

They begin breathing in unison.
95.

ELEANOR

That’s because they’ve never made
anything they’re proud of, honey.
You’re not here for them. You’re
here for your fans. Tonight will be
the greatest night of their lives
and the public will be at your feet
again. In just a few minutes, this
nightmare you’ve been living will
all be over, and it will have all
been worth it... Let me help you
get dressed.

INT. HALLWAY / UNDER THE STAGE - LATER

 

HANDHELD ON -

We follow CELESTE, the PA, and a few others down a long
corridor. She is now dressed in a surreal costume of white
feathers and structured shoulder pads that make her look like
a piece of Corbusier furniture.

SFX: An ambient drone. Percussion continues to amass. The
tension builds.

They finally reach Celeste’s TOUR MANAGER and a few others
who stand waiting for her.

PA
Here she is.

THE TOUR MANAGER
You look amazing!

CELESTE smiles, seems focused, less fucked up than before.

THE TOUR MANAGER (CONT’D)
Are you ready?

CELESTE
My daughter’s out there. Gotta make
this amazing for her.

THE TOUR MANAGER
Let’s get started. (calls out)
Everyone gather round me and Cel,
will ya?

The band hold hands in a huddle. Her TOUR MANAGER leads a
pre-show ritual.
96.

THE TOUR MANAGER (CONT’D)
I just want wanna say thank you for
this beautiful group of talented
people. I’d like to take a moment
to reflect on the last year and
this crew who are like family. None
of this would be possible without
you. Now, are you psyched for
tonight?

GROUP
Yeah!

THE TOUR MANAGER
Let’s give our girl some love!

They start to chant and rap.

CELESTE jumps around in the middle of the crew, she playfully
lunges at them like a prize-fighter.

The group chants a melodic mantra, singing “phenomenal” over
and over again. After a moment...

CELESTE
Who’s the badd-est bitch in the
room! ?

GROUP
You a-re!

CELESTE
Who’s the sickest b-and on the plan-
et?

GROUP
We a-re.

THE TOUR MANAGER
Who makes this possible?

GROUP
We do!

THE TOUR MANAGER
Are we be gonna be good?!

GROUP
No!

THE TOUR MANAGER
Are we gonna be great?!

CELESTE is like a new person, completely in her element.
97.

GROUP
NO!

THE TOUR MANAGER
Are we gonna be a-m-a-zing!?

GROUP
NO!

THE TOUR MANAGER
What are we gonna be then?!

GROUP
Phenomenal!

THE TOUR MANAGER
So, let us go higher and higher -
and higher - and higher - and
higher - and higher - and higher -
and higher - and higher - and
higher, break!

She high fives the group breathes heavy, and steps to a
platform where stylists put on a few finishing touches to
hair and make up.

Following the countdown from 10 Celeste is finally elevated
to the stage on a lift.

CAMERA stays tight on her on her rise up.

INT. STAGE - CONTINUOUS

CELESTE stands in silhouette against a set of massive
monitors that flash PAST, PRESENT, FUTURE over and over
again behind her.

The crowd of thousands is only occasionally illuminated in
brief flashes of light.

SFX: An ambient warble floods the space with sound.
Percussion occasionally rises and falls in the mix.

She speaks into a mic saturated with vocal fx.

CELESTE
(heavy reverb)
TONIGHT.
(MORE )
98.

CELESTE (CONT'D)
WE ARE GONNA BRING IT BACK TO WHERE
IT ALL BEGAN (began, began, began).
You want to travel back in time
with me?

The crowd cheers wildly.

CELESTE (CONT'D)
I can’t hear YOU!

The crowd cheers louder now.

CELESTE (CONT'D)
That’s right, bitches... As some of
you might have heard, Celeste is
Latin for... “heavenly.” Do you
find me heavenly?

She suddenly strikes a new pose. Excessive cheering...

CELESTE (CONT'D)
Ha ha, I hear all you angels.
70,000 of my little angels.

She breathes heavy.

The crowd

A wave of

CELESTE (CONT'D)
So, tell me, how many of you out
there have ever had a boy break
your heart (heart, heart, heart)?

responds more and more to the playful tease.

CELESTE (CONT'D)
That’s what I thought - and how
many of my little angels cry
themselves to sleep at night
because somebody called you an ugly
name? Fat, hideous, slut. Well,
guess what? People have been trying
to take me down for years but I
won’t STAY DOWN.

applause.

CELESTE (CONT'D)
Listen close cause tonight is for
you, angels. I hear your prayers.
This is the new New Testament and
tonight is ALL FOR YOU (you, you,

you, you, you).

A screen displaying a close-up of CELESTE’S face lights up
behind her.
99.

The monitors on the right and left flash VOICE, OF, LIGHT
over and over again.

CELESTE (CONT'D)
(no reverb)

Welcome to the VOX LUX tour, a

night you're not soon to forget.

EXALT ME ALL THE WAY UP PAST THE

STARS. HIT IT!

THE BEAT DROPS and light shoots up in wide beams all around
Celeste.

A new shift in the light reveals a backdrop of massive white
squares, something unusually architectural like graph paper.

Then suddenly 60 DANCERS DRESSED EXACTLY AS CELESTE enter
from the right and left and she is lost in the crowd of them.
They occasionally strike unique poses.

CELESTE (CONT'D)
(sings in autotune)

VOX, LUX, RADIANT FLUX, FUTURE,

POWER, NEVER, BETTER, VOX, LUX,

RADIANT FLUX, FUTURE, CAN’T, COME

SOONER, LOVE, SEX, PROMISE, DESIRE

CELESTE breaks into a regular singing voice, suddenly alone
on stage.

CELESTE (CONT'D)
(sings)

Reading the papers making up

stories (stories)

I got 50 to life but who’s on the

jury (jury)

Ya never met me but you already

know me (know me)

The same old shit, the same old

story (story)

CELESTE shifts her vocal style for the bridge...

CELESTE (CONT'D)
I’m made of stone, not bone

Made up of steel, nothing re-al.

But I’m looking at you looking at
me

And I can feel my heart begin to

take a be-at

BACK to the CHORUS.
100.

CELESTE (CONT'D)
VOX, LUX, RADIANT FLUX, FUTURE,
POWER, NEVER, BETTER,
VOX, LUX, RADIANT FLUX, FUTURE,
CAN'T, COME SOONER

EVERYONE SINGS ALONG TO THE LYRICS.

The dancers return to the stage and lift CELESTE high above
them.

SFX: Berlioz’s choral piece “La Damnation de Faust” starts to

NARRATOR
Late one night at the hospital,
following that fateful morning at
Ridgewood, Celeste made a maddening
claim that only her sister had ever
sensed to be true. She recounted a
story to Eleanor that went like
this... Shortly after her classmate
pulled the trigger and sent her to
the place between life and death, a
Place that she could only really
ever describe to Eleanor as a “rush
of color;” she had met the devil
and made a deal with him in
exchange for her life. He whispered
her melodies and she returned with
a mission to bring great change to
the next century.

after me.”

CELESTE begins to shut her eyes...
The NARRATOR speaks now at a very deliberate pace.
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
One for the money.
Two for the show.
On three we get ready.
And on four - come with me.
CELESTE’s expression conveys that though her spirit is

exhausted at the peak of its achievement, it really has all
been an achievement, nonetheless.
