TITLE: There Will Be Blood

EXT. NEW MEXICO DESERT — DAY — 1898

CAMERA looks up a steep trail. Half the frame filled with a
hill in close distance, the other half is sky..over the top of
the hill we see a prospector’s pick come up and then down..up and
then down..up and then down...

ANGLE. BEHIND THE MAN WITH THE PICK.

DANIEL C. PLAINVIEW (late 30’s here) is, with pick and ax,

in the middle of the day, in 110 degree heat in New Mexico,
searching for SILVER.

He has a shaft about fifteen feet deep at this point.
Nearby is a MULE and a CART. He digs and digs and digs.

FRONT ANGLE. CU. DANIEL’S FACE.
He continues.

cuT TO:
EXT. DESERT — EVENING.
The MULE is pulling a cart filled with his prospector’s
supplies. He walks beside, across the very rough desert
terrain. HOLD.

cuT TO:
EXT. MINE SHAFT — ANOTHER DAY.

He’s back at it again. The SHAFT IS NOW TWENTY FEET DEEP.

He hears something outside the SHAFT in between swings
of the pick...

He listens..waits..continues with the work..but turns back
and climbs up out of the SHAFT...

ANGLE, MOUTH OF THE SHAFT.
He climbs out and looks;

TA

His MULE has dropped dead in the heat. It is out like a light, 4A
turned over on it’s side, the CART has fallen over with it..

He walks over, inspects, wipes his sweat off, takes a break for
a minute and then goes back in the shaft.

CUT TO:
INT. SHAFT. LATER. 5
CU. PICK into earth once again.
CU. DANIEL. He sees something in the earth here.

HIS POV — IN THE ROCK. The clear tracing, glistening vein of a
SLIVER ORE CHAMBER.

HOLD ON HIS FACE. AND THE CAMERA EXAMINES CLOSELY THESE MINERALS
IN THE ROCK. PLAY OUT FULL.

OUTSIDE THE SHAFT, LATER. 6
He unleashes the dead mule from the CART. and begins to LOAD IN
MASSIVE CHUNKS OF ROCK, LEADED WITH SILVER ORE INTO THE CART.

He catches his breath. He wipes his face and he goes back into

the SHAFT — but as he starts back down — somewhere between

passing out and tripping -- he plunges — loosing all his

balance, twists around and HEADS FEET FIRST STRAIGHT DOWN THE

SHAFT WITH NO HOLD — AND LANDS AT THE BOTTOM — 6A

BOTH HIS ANKLES SNAP TOWARDS EACH OTHER.
HOLD. He passes out.

CU. DANIEL. 7
maybe a few moments later and he has come to..he looks up to the
top of SHAFT and sees the light —

So..over the course of however long it takes, he pulls himself up
and out of the MINE SHAFT.

ANGLE, MOUTH OF THE SHAFT.
he arrives at the opening..He puts himself on his back and
rests..HOLD.

As he opens his eyes, he notices that the CART — from the weight 7A
of SILVER ORE - it has tipped forward..and in doing so, has

dropped his CANTEEN OF WATER that had been strapped safely to

the cart —

water dribbles out in a pool of mud where the canteen sits.

CuT TO:
EXT. DESERT. DAY
DANIEL is pushing the cart with the upper half of his body..then
he drags himself to catch up with the cart — he does this over

and over and over and over again across the desert floor —

CAMERA BEHIND HIM. Way off, in the distance, about a mile,
is the trace of a small town —

cut TO:

INT. SILVER ASSAY OFFICE/LEASE OFFICE - DAY.

 

DANIEL, laying on his back on the floor of the office.
CU's of watching the assay process and tallying up the value of
the silver..He will sell this lease and move on...

curt TO:

EXT. SOMEWHERE IN CALIFORNIA. DAY — A FEW YEARS LATER — 1902
DANIEL is working again in a large field with some MEN.
There is: CANBURRY (30s) an OLDER MAN (50s) and a YOUNG MAN
(around 15) and a mining acquaintance: H.B. AILMAN (30s) and
nearby, kept in the shade in a small bassinet, is a ONE YEAR
OLD BABY, Ailman’s son (H.W.)

They are again, with pick and ax, digging a well.

They have a rope to a Horse and have connected the rope to
a pulley to raise and lower buckets into and out of the muck.

They shovel the muddy dirt into buckets, load the contents onto
a cart, which they take by a MULE to another area and dump.

CAMERA LOOKS DOWN INIDE THE WELL.

They are at SIXTY FEET. Inside the well is DANIEL and AILMAN.
Under their feet is oil soaked SHALE..it is emitting considerable
quantities of gas and crackling like heated popcorn.

The FUMES are CHOKING. They have RAGS TO THEIR FACES.

After a few moments, DANIEL PASSES STRAIGHT OUT. AILMAN

SMACKS HIM, SMACKS HIM. WAKES HIM.

CU. NEWSPAPER CLIPPING. 12
It shows the picture of an old, very crude derrick in
Pennsylvania.

WIDER, THAT MOMENT.

DANIEL, AILMAN, CANBURRY all stand over the picture, pointing
to it, getting to the bottom of how it works. quick scene
discussing exactly what would be needed to build such a rig.

CcuT TO:
EXT. DRILLING SITE — DAY 13
This crew of men has erected a very CRUDE TWENTY FOOT TALL
DERRICK. They have fashioned a drill by attaching a cross
shaped bit to a three inch rod. They've got a pump, driven
by horsepower.
DANIEL operates the drill that’s essentially a 20ft eucalyptus
tree. The large apparatus drives deep into the ground — the
first hit is very successful.

He brings the drill back up for a second attempt.

WIDE ANGLE.
DANIEL drives the 300 pound apparatus down — it breaks loose
from his hands -- SLIPS COMPLETELY FROM HIS GRASP — AND PLUMMETS

— He is left holding nothing...
he just watches it fall down the hole.
cur TO:
INT. HOLE. — THAT MOMENT 14

THE DRILL/LOG COMES FALLING DOWN, STRAIGHT AT CAMERA. IT FALLS,
STRAIGHT DOWN THE HOLE AND SPLINTERS APART.

HOLD.
ANGLE, DANIEL, UP AT THE TOP. 14a

AILMAN has DESCENDED INTO THE DARK HOLE. DANIEL and the
rest are up top. AILMAN wears a RUBBER RAIN SLICKER.
MUD EVERYWHERE.

DANIEL COACHES FROM ABOVE.

IN THE WELL, AILMAN, HALF PASSING OUT, AND HANGING FROM A PULLEY
DEVICE, WRESTLES THE DRILL FREE BY KICKING IT WITH HIS FEET OVER
AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN — IT EVENTUALLY BREAKS FREE AND CAN BE
BROUGHT UP.

MOMENTS LATER, AT THE TOP. 15A
AILMAN AND THE DRILL PIECE ARE PULLED TO THE TOP.

CuT TO:
EXT. HOLE. DAY. 16

with DANIEL. It’s all been re-constructed. They are drilling.
drilling. ON ONE BLOW -- they HIT SOMETHING VERY HARD. SOLID.

THEY CAN'T BUDGE THE DRILL FOR A MINUTE. THEN THEY GET IT.
THEY PULL THE RIG UP AND OUT.
CU. THE DRILL LOG.
it lands on the ground. It’s ABSOLUTELY SOAKED in OIL
measuring up about 10ft on the large WOOD DRILL PIECE.
DANIEL enters FRAME, on his side..gets down and looks at it.
His breathing gets heavier and heavier and a little crazy. HOLD.
CUT TO:
EXT. DRILLING SITE. DAYS LATER. 17
This scene shows how they are taking the oil, dumping it into a

reservoir they’ve built, then taking that and putting it into
whatever they’ve got: cans, containers, barrels, bottles, etc. etc.

AILMAN works while holding the one-year-old H.W. in his arms.

INT. SHAFT. 18

DANIEL and AILMAN are in the shaft, working something.

They are moving in and out of consciousness, but are somehow
driving forward, fixing a part of the drill. OIL and MUD are
pooled underneath them.

DANIEL hears something. looks up.

ANGLE, THE TIMBER SUPPORTS THAT SURROUND THE WELL.
something has come loose...

CU. DANIEL.
he looks at AILMAN.

CU. TIMBER
a very large, sharp piece, like an icicle, cracks in the
support and comes flying STRAIGHT AT CAMERA.

DANIEL AND AILMAN. TWO SHOT.

THE PIECE COMES FLYING DOWN LIKE A DAGGER AND GOES STRAIGHT
INTO THE TOP OF AILMAN’S HEAD, BLOOD PUSHES FROM HIS MOUTH
AND EYES AND SPRAYS DANIEL.

HOLD, CU. ON DANIEL. in a state of shock.
CUT TO:
EXT. DRILLING SITE. DAY 19
DANIEL looks at the BABY, HW, in the basket..HOLD. He picks him
up and walks around with him, holding onto him awkwardly..He puts
him back in the basket, looks around..looks back at this baby
H.W...
CUT TO:
INT. FLOP HOUSE. NIGHT 20
The young baby H.W. is CRYING at the top of it’s lungs, laying
in the bed next to DANIEL who is out cold. Everyone else is
asleep in this flophouse.
Daniel wakes up, takes some WHISKEY from his bag, pours it on
his FINGER and puts it in the baby’s mouth. He sips
some himself..baby H.W. cries and cries and cries...
ANGLE, LATER.

DANIEL carries the baby H.W. to a corner of the flophouse
where a MOTHER and FATHER and THREE CHILDREN are sleeping.

The MOTHER gently takes out her breast and puts the baby H.W.
to it, calming and quieting the child.

Daniel falls back asleep sitting on the floor.
CUT TO:
INT. TRAIN. MOVING. DAY. 21

CAMERA holds on DANIEL sleeping. The baby, H.W. is
in the seat next to him, awake and looking about.

CAMERA moves in CLOSE ON THEM BOTH. HOLD.
LONG DISSOLVE TO:
CU. DANIEL CALDECOT PLAINVIEW. (D.C. PLAINVIEW) — 1908 22

A few (six) years later. He is dressed well now. slight show
of some wealth. overcoat, haircut, clean shaven, etc. We see
nothing but him as he speaks;

DANIEL
Ladies and Gentlemen, I’ve traveled
over half our state to get here this
evening. I couldn't get away sooner because
my new well was coming in at Coyote Hills and
I had to see about it. That well is now
flowing at two thousand barrels and it’s
paying me an income of five thousand dollars
a week. I have two others drilling and I have
sixteen producing at Antelope.
So — Ladies and Gentlemen — if I say I’m an
oil man, you will agree.

(beat)
You have a great chance here — but bear in
mind: you can loose it all if you’re not
careful. Out of all men that beg for a chance
to drill your lots, maybe one in twenty will be
oil men; the rest will be speculators — men
trying to get between you and the oil men — to
get some of the money that ought by rights come
to you. Even if you find one that has money,
and means to drill, he’1ll maybe know nothing
about drilling and he’1ll have to hire out the
job on contract — and then you’re depending on
a contractor that’s tryin’ to rush the job
through — so he can get another contract just
as quick as he can. This is way that this
works.
An OC VOICE INTERRUPTS, LOUDLY; Daniel holds his composure.

OC MALE VOICE
WHAT IS YOUR OFFER? WE'RE WASTING TIME.

DANIEL
I do my own drilling and the men that work
for me, work for me and they are men I know.
I make it my business to be there and see to
their work. I don’t lose my tools in the hole
and spend months fishing for them; I don’t
botch the cementing off and let water in the
hole and ruin the whole lease.

REVEAL, AT THAT MOMENT, young H.W. (age 7) He is standing behind
Daniel and looking at the group OC. Daniel and H.W.;

DANIEL
I'm fixed like no other
company in this field and that’s
because my Coyote Hills well has just
come in — I have a string of tools
all ready to put to work..I can load a rig
onto trucks and have them here in a week.
I have business connections so I can get
the lumber for the derrick — such things go
by friendship in a rush like this.
And this is why I can guarantee to start
drilling and put up the cash to back my word.
I assure you, whatever the others promise
to do, when it comes to the showdown, they
won't be there...

REVERSE, THE ROOM, THAT MOMENT

About TEN FAMILIES have packed themselves into a very small
BUNGALOW HOME in Signal Hill near Long Beach, Calif. They are
a hungry group;

MAN
THAT’S FINE. THAT’S JUST FINE, BUT HOW
DO YOU PROPOSE TO SPLIT UP THE LOTS?

WOMAN
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING, MR. PLAINVIEW?

MARRIED MAN
WE DON’T HAVE TIME FOR THIS IF YOU
CAN'T TELL US HOW YOU PLAN TO PAY
EACH AND EVERY PERSON THAT IS
IN THIS ROOM.
ANOTHER MAN
LET HIM FINISH. LET HIM FINISH.

MAN
IF SOMEONE HAS A MARKED BOUNDARY AND
A SMALL LOT, THAT INFRINGES —

ANOTHER MAN
LET HIM FINISH!

MAN
INFRINGING ON MY LOT AND TAKING MY MONEY.

ANOTHER MAN
LET HIM FINISH. Please, Mr. Plainview --

DANIEL
It’s not up to me to say how you’re going
to divide the royalty. But let me say this;
whatever you give up so you can get together —
it will be smart compared to what you may loose
by delay. The crooks and the gamblers are near
and the wolf is scratching the door.
Ladies and Gentlemen, take it from
me as an oil man — humbly — there aren’t going
to be many gushers here at Signal Hill.
A field plays out very quick. In two or three
years, these wells will be dry — even this
discovery well that’s gushing down the road and
has everyone so crazy. So my suggestion, with
respect, is take a smaller share of royalty
and we will see that it’s a small
share of a bigger royalty. That,
ladies and gentleman, is what I had to say.

HOLD ON THE ROOM. Everyone has taken this in, then: THE ROOM
ERUPTS AS EACH FAMILY SCREAMS AND YELLS AND UNLEASHES THEIR
WRATH AT EACH OTHER ABOUT HOW THEIR LOTS SHOULD BE DIVIDED AND
ROYALTIES SHARED AND MEASURMENTS OF “SMALL LOTS” “BIG LOTS”
“LITTLE BIG LOTS” “LITTLE SMALL LOTS” WOMEN SCREAM: “WE SHOULD
JUST GO WITH A FAMILY OPERATION, IT’S MORE IMPORTANT!” A MAN
SCREAMS: “BULL.”

We witness human dignity go completely out the window.

Daniel stands, slowly turns and walks out the door, without even
being noticed. H.W. walks out behind Daniel...

CUT TO:
23

EXT. SIGNAL HILL — THAT MOMENT. 23

CAMERA leads DANIEL and H.W. out of the bungalow and onto the
street, they are followed out of the house by a small man named
PRESCOTT (50s) pleading his case —

PRESCOTT
no, please, Mr. Plainview where are you going?

DANIEL
I don’t need the lease, thank you.

PRESCOTT
But, no, no, we need you, we'd like
for you to begin —

DANIEL
There’s too much confusion. Thank
you for your time.

PRESCOTT
No confusion, let us just, please come
back and we can all settle this —

DANIEL
I wouldn’t take the lease if you gave
it to me as a gift.

DANIEL and H.W. keep walking, THEY JUMP OVER THE OIL THAT FLOWS
IN THE GUTTER, OF THIS SUBURBAN TRACT COMMUNITY/UNDER
CONSTRUCTION. PEOPLE IN THE STREETS, BUYING, SELLING, ETC.

WE CAN SEE THE TOP OF A DERRICK IN THE DISTANCE ON A HILL.

They walk down the center of the street and off up a
side road --

BANKSIDE HOME — NIGHT. 24

INT.

DANIEL is now sitting with a nice, mild mannered man: JIM
BANKSIDE (50s) his WIFE sits with him and their TWO SONS aged 10

and 12.

BEAT.

HW sits beside Daniel and a bit behind;

DANIEL
Mr. Bankside, I’m not going to waste
your time and I’d like it if you didn’t
waste mine. If you want to sign with
me we can have a well drilling within
ten days. Your lot is further North from
the discovery well up here so it means we
will probably have to dig deeper. If there's
as much oil up here as I think there is, it
will be harder to reach but once we find it
we can take it right out. But we have to
act quickly because very soon these grounds
will dry up. I need you to know what you
want to do. Because of the distance
from the discovery well I’1l pay you a smaller
royalty than you’d get down there — but I'll
give you a thousand dollar bonus on your lot.

BANKSIDE
what royalty?

DANIEL
A sixth — now that’s standard.
And a guarantee to start
drilling within ten days — which isn’t.

KIDS
DO IT, DAD. DO IT. DO IT.

BANKSIDE (to kids)
SHUT UP.

DANIEL
The oil—game is like heaven. Everyone is
called but few are chosen.

MRS. BANKSIDE
Where is your wife?

DANIEL
She died at child birth, Mrs. Bankside.
It’s just me and my boy.

Bankside takes all this in, then:

EXT. DERRICK FLOOR — EVENING — WEEKS LATER. 25

DANIEL is guiding the process on the floor of the derrick,
Which has been erected ON TOP OF/NEXT TO/IN the BANKSIDE HOME.

HOLD on this process, and introduce the main team of DRILLERS
that Daniel works with; BEN BLAUT (40s), MURGINS (50s) JOE
GHUNDA (40s) and FOUR OTHER FACES/ROUGHNECKS. We watch them and
hear technical details, etc.

«there is a DEEP, DARK RUMBLE..the men get ready...

--it’s very quiet...

CAMERA looks straight down onto the men working..and IN A FLASH: 25A
A BURST OF GAS/WATER/OIL COMES STRIAGHT UP AND AT THE CAMERA.

THE SCREEN GOES BLACK.
OIL SPRAYS ALL OVER THE BANKSIDE HOUSE... 25B

«THE MEN CONTAIN THE GUSHER and "tie-off”..leading the oil
into waiting LARGE DRUM CONTAINERS.

«INSIDE THE CONTAINER’s..we watch the OIL FILL UP. 25C
CUT TO:
INT. PLAINVIEW AMERICA DRILLING CO. (BANKSIDE HOUSE) — NIGHT 26

 

Inside what was the Bankside home, Daniel and his main partner
in business: FLETCHER HAMILTON (40s) have made offices. It’s
clearly been a few hard weeks of work, the home is now dirty,
cramped, with tools, paper, etc. This has become their home
base. Just outside the window, we see the BASE OF THE DERRICK,
invading the living room/kitchen —

H.W. sleeps on a cot in the corner, behind Daniel’s desk.
OUTSIDE, we hear the drilling and yelling and all the rest of
the circus...

A YOUNG KID (PAUL SUNDAY aged 16) knocks on the screen door,
looks inside. He is skinny, dirty, traveled, worn;

PAUL SUNDAY
mr. plainview?

DANIEL
yes?
He steps inside.

PAUL SUNDAY
are you daniel plainview?

DANIEL
yes.

BEAT.

DANIEL
what can I do for you?

PAUL SUNDAY
you look for oil?

DANIEL
yes.

PAUL SUNDAY
what do you pay for a place that has it?

DANIEL
that depends.

PAUL SUNDAY
what does it depend on?

DANIEL
lots of things.

PAUL SUNDAY
If I told you I knew a place
that had oil, where land could be
bought cheaply — what do you think
that would be worth?

DANIEL
I think you’d have to let me know
what you know. And we would try
and work something out.

PAUL SUNDAY
Can I sit down?

BEAT. He sits.

PAUL SUNDAY
what church do you belong to?
BEAT.

DANIEL
I..I enjoy all faiths..I don’t belong
to one church in particular — I like
them all — I like everything. Where are
you from?

PAUL SUNDAY
That would be telling you.
That’s what I want to sell you.

DANIEL
what are you doing in Signal Hill?

PAUL SUNDAY
fe have oil and it seeps through the
ground -- do you want to pay me
to know where it is?

 

DANIEL
just because there’s something on the ground
doesn’t mean there’s anything beneath it.

PAUL SUNDAY
why did Standard Oil buy up land?

BEAT. Paul just looks at him;

DANIEL
Is it in California?

PAUL SUNDAY
maybe.

DANIEL
How much land did they buy?

PAUL SUNDAY
I'd like it better if you didn’t
think I was stupid.

DANIEL
«why did you come to me?

PAUL SUNDAY
You just brought this well in.

DANIEL
that’s right.
PAUL SUNDAY
yeah, so: just give me five hundred dollars
in cash right now and I’ll tell you
where it is.

DANIEL
I’1l give you one hundred dollars now
and if it looks like a promising lease,
I’1l give you a thousand dollar bonus.

PAUL SUNDAY
Six hundred dollars.

DANIEL
tell me one thing to help me decide:
what else do you have up there?
what do you grow?

PAUL SUNDAY
We have a big ranch, but it’s mostly rocks.
you plant things, nothing grows but weeds —
what makes you think it’s up?

FLETCHER
is there sulphur around or alkali deposits?

PAUL SUNDAY
Alkali nearby. I don’t know sulphur.

H.W. wakes up in the b.g., behind Daniel’s desk and looks at the
scene, sees the boy, looks around..Paul looks from H.W. to
Daniel;

PAUL SUNDAY
Is that your son?

DANIEL
yes.

PAUL SUNDAY
Hi.

H.W.
Hi.

PAUL SUNDAY (to Fletcher)
Who are you?

FLETCHER
My name is Fletcher Hamilton.
nice to meet you, Paul.
PAUL SUNDAY
What do you do?

FLETCHER
I work with Mr. Plainview.

DANIEL
four hundred dollars...

PAUL SUNDAY
It’s six now.
I’m leaving my home for good,
so I need this -- I want six
hundred dollars. give it to me
or I'll go somewhere else.

Daniel reaches into his pocket — he has $300 — Fletcher gets out
an envelope and gives him another $300.

PAUL SUNDAY
I come from a town called Little Boston
in Isabella County.

ANGLE, MOMENTS LATER.
They have a map spread out and tacked up on the wall. DANIEL,
FLETCHER, HW and PAUL over it as he points.

PAUL SUNDAY
this is us here. spur station
here at Little Boston. The Sunday
ranch is what you’re looking for.
There’s a sheep trail that leads you
there — it’s a mile from town heading
west — not far. just through a small
pass — near the base of the hills.
follow the sheep trail.

DANIEL
And where did Standard buy up?

PAUL SUNDAY
Here and here.

PAUL SUNDAY
Two. Mary and Ruth.

DANIEL
What’s your name?

PAUL SUNDAY
Paul.

FLETCHER
Does your family know about the oil
that you say is there?

PAUL SUNDAY
I don’t know. My Uncle always said
there was oil there — but I don’t
know what they heard or what they think.

FLETCHER
what do you grow?

PAUL SUNDAY
it's goats. a goat farm. I told you:
there’s nothing grows up there but weeds.

FLETCHER

PAUL SUNDAY

it’s salty. you drill a well,

it hard not to get salt water.

PAUL SUNDAY
No. I wanna go now. I wanna leave.

Daniel walks over to him.

DANIEL
If I travel all the way there and
I find out that you're a liar,
I’ll find you and I’1l take more than
my money back, is that alright with you?

PAUL SUNDAY
yessir.

BEAT.

PAUL SUNDAY
nice luck to you. good bye.

He leaves. HOLD with Daniel, Fletcher and HW.

FLETCHER

there a few days ago...

(beat)
Anything he’s seeing on the ground
could just be loose stuff set free...

HOLD.
CuT TO:

EXT, TRAIN DEPOT/LITTLE BOSTON, CALIFORNIA — LATE DAY. 27
CAMERA looks down a long stretch of TRAIN TRACKS that cuts
across a dry, flat, empty valley floor.

We can see, in the distance, the faint trace of DANIEL and HW
driving in their CAR on a road that runs parallel to the

tracks. They bounce up and down, dust trail behind them — we PAN
WITH THEM AS THEY ARRIVE AT:

THE TRAIN DEPOT OF LITTLE BOSTON. We see some small, rolling 28
hills in the distance...

They PARK THEIR CAR next to the SPUR STATION, UNLOAD SOME
CAMPING EQUPIMENT FROM THEIR CAR and start walking off..we see
the TOWN OF LITTLE BOSTON NEARBY...

DANIEL and HW walk the road on the outskirts of town
and towards the hills --
29

CUT TO:

They’re walking with the HEAVY CAMPING EQUIPMENT.

H.W. starts to fall a bit, with the camping equipment, Daniel
catches him, props him up a bit;

DANIEL
Alright?

yeah.

They walk some more until Daniel sees something coming up ahead
in the distance, says to HW;

DANIEL
Remember your silence..(walk beside me,
not behind me.)

CAMERA PANS LFT, becomes THEIR POV: Coming towards them, from
the distance is a MAN. This is ABEL SUNDAY (50s) He is very

They continue to chat as they walk up the road. IN the distance
are some minor rolling hills...they head around a bend..and we
see a CHURCH ON A HILL...
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. SUNDAY RANCH/MOMENTS LATER. 30

The three men come up to the small, very run down HOME.
Standing, waiting outside is the SUNDAY FAMILY:

MOTHER SUNDAY (50s) RUTH SUNDAY (aged 12) MARY SUNDAY (aged 7)

I’m sorry we don’t have any bread.
Corn just doesn’t fill out in the hills here.
It’s mostly rock and we don’t have room
to raise the grain...

They chat a bit more as -- DISSOLVE TO:

DANIEL and HW and ABEL SUNDAY sit close to the FIRE.

Just back a bit, on stones, sits the rest of the FAMILY and ELI.
Abel directs the girls to clear and wash their dishes — they
collect the dishes, and then;

ABEL SUNDAY
Brother, may I ask you a personal question?

DANIEL
Yes.

ABEL SUNDAY
Are you saved?

DANIEL
VS...

ABEL SUNDAY
And you’ve been washed in Blood?

DANIEL
Yes, brother. We’ve been washed.

ABEL SUNDAY
What is your church?

DANIEL
Our church is called The Church of the World.

ABEL SUNDAY
I don’t know that Church. I don’t know
what their message is --

DANIEL
Yes.
23

ABEL SUNDAY
Can you tell me about the message of the
Church of the World?

DANIEL
Well, Brother Abel, we are told in the Book
not to discuss our faith with stangers.
Even if they’re so nice and helpful.

ABEL SUNDAY
We're told in our book, “The Lord
has called us to preach the Gospel
unto them.”

DANIEL
Yes, that’s right. “And the Gospel must
first be published among all nations.”

ABEL SUNDAY
That's right!

DANIEL
But according to our faith, we believe
that we get to know a man through friendship —
and business — and we talk about faith later.

ELI speaks up;

ELI
May I ask a question?

DANIEL
Yes, Eli?

ELI
What does your Church teach about earthquakes?

DANIEL
About the earthquakes? Like the
earthquake you had up here?
(beat)
We are taught that it is God’s mighty power.

ABEL SUNDAY
My son is a healer and a vessel
for the Holy Spirit. He has a church...
32

33

24

ELI
Our earthquake means that the Holy
Spirit has grown weary of drunkeness and
lying in the world.

(beat)
Have you been doing any of these things?

H.W.
No we haven't.

DANIEL (to Eli)
No, son. We haven't.

ELI
thank you.

No one seems to know what to say next, so they stand and say
good night and head back to their house. Daniel, H.W. get inside

to the sea -- we can go into town and see

a map - but what we do — we take a pipeline
from here to Port Hueneme or Santa Paula and
we make a deal with Union Oil — this is what
we do and we don’t need the railroads

and the shipping costs anymore, you see?
38

27

AW
yeah.

DANIEL

what would you say is a fair price for
this lot, Abel?

Everyone stops eating and looks at Daniel: Abel is very excited:

ABEL SUNDAY
The Lord has sent you here.
The Prophet Daniel.

DANIEL
yes. let me finish telling you —

ABEL SUNDAY
This is according to the revelation of
the True Word. This is it.

DANIEL
I think it is, yes. now what would
you say is a fair price?

ABEL SUNDAY
Five dollars an acre.

ELI
Six.
DANIEL
Six dollars. thank you, Eli.

ABEL SUNDAY
And with the improvements I’ve made at
five hundred --

DANIEL
I'll offer to buy the ranch
for thirty-seven hundred dollars.

That's three thousand and seven
hundred dollars.

BEAT. MOTHER SUNDAY speaks:

MOTHER SUNDAY
I don’t want to leave here, this isn’t
for sale.

DANIEL
no, no, no. you don’t have to leave.
You may stay here as long as you like and
I will give you my word — you can have all
the farming rights — what we can do is
develop a lease — I will lease you the land
after the purchase for the next ninety-nine
years at ten dollars a year.

MOTHER SUNDAY
We don’t have any money.

DANIEL
I’m giving you some...

Everything gets quiet.

DANIEL
Does this seem fair to you?

ELI
And what do you want to do about the rock oil?

DANIEL
what about it?

ELI
We have oil here. that’s worth something.

DANIEL
do you have someone who can
drill for it?

ELI

DANIEL
Do you think there's oil here?

ELI
I know there is.

DANIEL
it’s very expensive to drill..to get
it up out of the ground.
have you ever tried that before?

ELI
how much is it?

DANIEL
«costly.

ELI
what would you give us for that?

DANIEL
I don’t know.

ELI
SOMETHING YOU DON’T KNOW!

DANIEL
what would you like, Eli?
30

ELI
I think that you should share
the mineral rights with my Church.
you've given us the farming rights,
now why not share the mineral rights?

BEAT. Eli and Daniel hold a look on each other;

DANIEL
If we decide to drill for oil,
if the well begins to produce
I'll give your Church a five thousand
dollar signing bonus.

ELI
that’s not enough.

DANIEL

do you want to find someone else
that’s gonna come up here and
drill? Eli? make the investment
and do all the work that goes
into it? I can hunt for quail

on another ranch just as easily
as I can here.

BEAT. Eli is quiet.

DANIEL
I would be happy to be a supporter of
your Church as long as I can.
with the bonus only..I do have
some connections that could get
us started drilling for oil..how
do you feel about that Abel?

ABEL

ELI (re: the car)

DANIEL
looks like it.

DANIEL hops down, grabs some camping equipment and moves towards

ELI gives HW a little PUSH, ACCIDENTALY/ON PURPOSE and he goes
straight to the ground. Daniel turns and looks --

DANIEL
you alright?

HW
yeah.

They start getting their car packed up.

ELI
That’s a very nice car.

AL ROSE (40s)

DANIEL
Hello.

AL ROSE
hello. can I help you?
32

DANIEL
Well..I‘d like to talk to you.
I’m looking for some land, I've
just bought the Sunday ranch, and...
.where’s the map?

ANGLE, MOMENTS LATER.

A MAP of the entire area is spread out on the desk in front of
them; They look it over. Daniel takes out a small notepad and
pencil, works it throughout;

AL ROSE
There’s the Bandy tract which is the
neighboring lot. He has over 600 acres --

DANIEL
and what about this?

AL ROSE
AC Maude, Blodget, Redlick...Carr...

DANIEL
What’s it held at?

AL ROSE
Six dollars an acre.

DANIEL
and what about this?

AL ROSE
That’s the Belvins and that
could be got, I’m sure.

DANIEL
Can everything around here be got?

AL ROSE

BEAT. THEN; Daniel looks up.

AL ROSE
sure.

They sit down;
DANIEL
I want you to buy this for me and I want
you to be my man, Al. But I want it just
enough to pay fair price — and I don’t want
it any more than that. People don’t need
to start boosting prices. If they do, you can
tell them to forget it and I’1l forget it too.
You can collect your commission from the seller
in the usual way and on top of that you can
have five percent from me. And that’1l
be what makes you a man. You seem aware enough
that this should be done quickly and quietly
so there aren’t any ideas that there’s a boom
on — does this make sense to you?

AL ROSE
Yes. but I’m not sure how quietly --

DANIEL
Son, can you go to the car and
get my bag please?

HW goes outside —

DANIEL
you make the buying for an unknown client —
you buy the options for cash — that means
if someone is home you should be able
to make a deal right there —

AL ROSE
you have this money on you?

DANIEL
I have some and I can have a wire for
more in the morning. have the options
ready so they can be signed on the spot —

HW comes back inside with a leather BAG and takes out some
FORMS.

DANIEL
I carry everything in my car. These forms
will make it easy for you — so let's
type up an agreement to list these tracts
and purchase the Sunday tract.
41

ANGLE, AT THE TYPEWRITER — LATER.
Al types out some contracts. Daniel stands over/behind him,
says:

DANIEL
If I needed to get a real road
in Little Boston that went out to the
Sunday Ranch -- who would be a good man
to talk to?

Al Rose looks up from the typewriter at him..

AL ROSE
I’d talk to Jake Coffey.

DANIEL
What's Jake's business?

AL ROSE
Hay and Feed..and Insurance.

contact for a water well?

HOWARD
Sam Davis.

DANIEL
can you contact him for me and
have him meet my son out
at the Sunday ranch?

HOWARD

DANIEL
To drill a proper well.
My son knows what I'd like done.
Can I use that telephone?

DANIEL
Hello, Gene. Charlie. You guys are a long
way from Signal Hill. You on your way
somewhere else?

GENE BLAIZE
Passing through and looking around.
Funny to see you.

DANIEL
Funny.

GENE BLAIZE
Congratulations on your well, I heard
that hit nicely --

DANIEL
300 barrels a day. you remember my son, H.W.?

GENE BLAIZE
You boys are a regular family business...

DANIEL
you boys are a little late...

GENE BLAIZE
What'd you find?
DANIEL
I found some interesting prospects.

GENE BLAIZE
Did you hear Standard bought up?

DANIEL
«I did hear. further North.

GENE BLAIZE
that’s right.

DANIEL
I like you Gene, and I wanna tell you:
If you’re gonna make a play: look east,
cause there’s a lot around here
that’s been taken. I’d rather have it
be you than someone else.

WHRIGHTSMAN
Life must be easy when you've got such
a cute face to carry around with you.

DANIEL
Are you telling me how handsome my son is?

WHRIGHTSMAN
that’s right.

DANIEL
Thank you. That’s very nice.
Good luck. Remember what I said. Go east.

They leave..Gene Blaize calls out to H.W. --

Well, this tract here next to the Sunday

interested in a sale.

DANIEL
Who is he?

AL ROSE
He’s an old man, Bandy..he homsteaded here.
He lives with his grandson..he said he would
like to talk to you..

DANIEL
Is he boosting his price?

AL ROSE
He said he'd like to speak with you.

DANIEL
About what?

AL ROSE
I don’t know. He just said he’d
like to speak with whoever was doing
the buying.
DANIEL
did you mention my name?

AL ROSE
No.

DANIEL
I don’t have time to sit and speak
with this man, he either wants to
sell or not.

AL ROSE
It’s just the hilly stuff...

DANIEL
It’s a very good tract, this is
where the sulphur is, don’t tell
me if it’s good or not, Al, you
wouldn’t know. don’t talk to me like that.

AL ROSE
Well..maybe he wants to boost his price
and just speak with you about it.

DANIEL
I don’t see what good talking is going to do.
What does he raise up there, those pigs?

AL ROSE
That's right.

DANIEL
Well..let him wait. I don’t need this
man and I don’t need to sit and talk
with him to do what I want. You did
a good job, here. Al, Thank you.

AL ROSE

ELI
Yes. At that moment, you could
introduce me.

DANIEL
When you walk up?

ELI
That’s right.
And maybe you could say,
“The proud son of these hills...”

DANIEL
when?

ELI
When you introduce me.
So you would see me walking up.
and then. as I arrived, you could
say, something, a few words and then
say: “and now: the proud son of these
hills, who tended his father’s flock...”
and then you would say my name.

DANIEL
Sounds fine.
ELI
Good. will you remember the words?

H.W. walks proudly near his father. Daniel steps up to make a
speech. As he gathers to get ready, he notices, across the way
ELI’s arrival with some FOLLOWERS from his church.

Daniel speaks to the crowd;

DANIEL
It's such a pleasureable evening
to be here and begin this --
One man doesn’t prospect from the
ground — it takes a community of people.
And this is the best way — we stay together,
we pray together, we work together and we share
in the wealth together. Now before we spud in,
“Mary's Well Number One,” named for the lovely
Ms. Mary Sunday who is with us today —

Mary smiles.
DANIEL
I'd like to say:
“God Bless Us All.”

Eli waits for his signal..Daniel passes him over and looks to HW.

DANIEL
Go ahead now, son.

H.W. moves a lever, which gives the engine a thump and the CHAIN
gives a PULL and the gears give a RATTLE and the ROTARY TABLE
starts to TURN, and down underneath the derrick — comes

the sound —-- of spudding in. So they’ve begun.

His eyes open, but his body doesn’t move.

BEN
A man fell into the well.

DANIEL
What man?

BEN
Joe Gundha.

DANIEL
When was it?

BEN
Just ten minutes ago.
We were changing the bit, and this
fellow went down into the cellar

working around the hole, under the main stage of the derrick,
this is called, “the cellar” — he is working around deep,
slippery mud and thin sheets of oil ~~ without slipping a cover
over the hole — the dirt caves in about the edges, so that the
top of the hole is a kind of funnel, it’s edges slippery with

DANIEL and the WORKERS are working with a THREE PRONGED GRAB.

It’s essentially a CLAW that they are bending to fit down

the hole. They get the metal bent and attach it and then start
it’s descent down the hole..They’ve ripped up the floor boards on
the base of the derrick to make more room ---

ANGLE, INSIDE THE HOLE, WITH THE BODY. LOOKING UP. 58A
Various angles that show the BODY. and the claw coming down

The claw rips into the flesh and tears it up.

THE BODY IS PULLED UP AND OUT OF THE HOLE, COVERED IN MUD AND 58B

Eli is going full throttle:

ELI SUNDAY
~and from that day to this when a man
has been a sinner and has covered himself,
it has been by and through faith in the shed
blood of Jesus Christ. Every Jew covered
his sins and received pardon through the
blood of the rams and the doves!
An infidel that I met in Isabella County
said to me once, (mimics voice)
“But I Don’t Believe In Atonement
Through Blood. It Doesn’t Come Up
To My Ideas Of What Is Right.”
I SAID: “TO HELL WITH YOUR IDEAS OF
WHAT IS RIGHT. DO YOU THINK GOD IS COMING
DOWN HERE TO CONSULT YOU WITH YOUR
GREAT INTELLECT AND WONDERFUL BRAIN
AND FIND OUT WHAT YOU THINK IS RIGHT BEFORE
HE DOES IT? YOU MAKE ME SICK! YOU THINK
THAT BECAUSE YOU DON’T BELIEVE THAT IT
ISN'T TRUE? FOOL!”

ANGLE, MOMENTS LATER.

ELI is healing an OLDER WOMAN who is handicap and frail.

He is casting the evil spirits out and holding her head —
pushing out the spirits, shouting and whispering in unison until
she is up and walking and speaking in tongues;

ELI SUNDAY
THAT IS WHAT’S RIGHT! THAT IS WHAT'S
RIGHT YOU DUMMIES WHO DON’T BELIEVE!
YOU THINK GOD IS JUST GONNA STAND
BY AND LISTEN TO YOUR SNIVELING AND
CRYING ABOUT WHAT YOU BELIEVE?! DUMMIES!

Daniel approaches Eli at the front of the Church. Eli is going
over some plans to break the back wall of the church down and
add-on..there is some pre-construction work already..FOLLOWERS and
a few members of DANIEL’S CREW are there..go about their

business as Daniel and Eli speak;

DANIEL
Hello, Eli.

ELI
Daniel.

DANIEL

«we had a tragedy at the well
last night.

ELI
Yes I heard...

Eli holds up his hand for silence, and makes a silent prayer to
himself, then looks up:

DANIEL
Joe Ghunda was a deeply faithful
man and I was hoping you might
speak at his burial.

ELI
«Daniel: This accident could have
been avoided. It’s terrible to think
of that drilling well working
away up there unblessed —

DANIEL
Yes it could have. These men work
in twelve hour shifts and they need
their rest. If they don’t have it they
make stupid mistakes.

ELI
I’ve seen some of the men drinking
alcohol — do you think that has something
to do with it?
BEAT.

52

DANIEL
We need these men rested to bring
this well in — some of them can’t
get it if they’re coming here for
your gospel — and then the well can’t
produce and blow gold all over the place.

ELI
«I wish I'd had more time with
Joe Ghunda..more could have been done...

DANIEL
We'd be honored to have you speak at
his burial tomorrow. We can do it at
noon if that’s alright with you?

ELI
That would be fine.

DANIEL
Are you planning some renovations?

ELI
I had a vision from the
Holy Spirit that we'd be needing more room
at the Church of the Third Revelation.
He explained to me I was to break down this
wall, for his visits would be often —

BEAT. Daniel regards the church;

DANIEL
I must confess that I only know of two
revelations..there’s one in the old
testament and one in the new testament...
is that right?

ELI
That’s right, Daniel.
DANIEL
What is the Third?
ELI
Me........I am the Third Revelation.

Daniel and the Workers — they feel this and there are INSTANT
CALLS TO STOP AND HOLD THE WORK —

BEN BLAUT
HOLD! HOLD! WAIT!

Feeling the drill, realizing something has happened down below.
HOLD FOR A FEW MOMENTS as this is worked with, then:

BEN BLAUT and DANIEL confer;

BEN BLAUT
We've gotta twist off.

DANIEL
how far are we?

BEN BLAUT
900 ft.

He nods as if to say, “go ahead.”

So begins the process of “twisting off.” Which means; THE MEN

HAVE TO LIFT EVERY INCH OF THE 900 FT OF PIPE UP AND ouT,

UNSCREW IT IN 15 FT. SECTIONS, FOUR JOINTS AT A TIME, “BREAKING

OUT,” THEY CALL IT, UNTIL YOU FIND OUT WHERE THE “BREAK” IS.
CUT TO:

It’s night now and many hours later:

EXT. DERRICK — NIGHT. 64

It’s a bit later, and the MEN are “fishing” with a device that’s
like an ice man’s tongs, attempting to grab hold of the other
side of the broken piece and pull it back up.

«the NIGHT CREW comes in to replace the day crew. We have 2 —
12 hour shifts for these workers. The NIGHT FOREMAN is MURGINS
and he speaks with DANIEL and BEN who appraise him of the
situation.

ANGLE, DANIEL.
He takes a break, off to the side..smokes a cigarette..ABEL comes
over, sits down with him;

ABEL
may I sit down, Daniel?

Daniel doesn’t say anything..ABEL sits...

ABEL
How much longer will the men be fishing?

DANIEL
You keep fishing until you find the piece.

BEAT.

ABEL
it’s been almost three weeks..is that normal?

DANIEL
ABEL
in your Church of the World,
do you know the word, “backslider?”
DANIEL
ABEL
sometimes I think if you were to be
more honest with the Holy Spirit that

some of this misfortune might pass.

Silence.
55

ABEL
many of the new faces here have
joined Eli down at the Church of
The Third Revelation — I know you
haven’t had the time — but I know
that to lead a full life — you must make
the time. I know that if Eli were allowed
to perform a blessing on this well
that it would bear fruit and you
wouldn’t have to go fishing..but you need
to not be a backslider, Daniel.
you're on a very bad path.

DANIEL
am I?

ABEL
you don’t like the way I raise my
children and guide my family — but
one day you will see that my faith
is stronger than yours.

WITH THAT, ON THE FLOOR OF THE DERRICK, RISING UP AND BEING
SUCCESFULLY FISHED OUT, IS THE BROKEN PIECE.

 

THE CREW CELEBRATES, SMASHES THE BROKEN PIECE ON THE SIDE OF THE
DERRICK, SWEAR IT UP AND DOWN..DANIEL smiles, looks ahead and
says:

DANIEL
I think Eli is a lunatic.
And I think you are a weak little man.
And I’m glad to have your land
and to make a living off it where you
couldn’t. You’re lucky the day I showed
up here, Abel. So I want you to stay away
from me now. go back down to your house
and stay there. you'll know when the well
comes in.

DANIEL
LIGHTS OUT! LIGHTS OUT! EVERYONE LIGHTS OUT.

But it’s too late — SOMETHING SPARKS THE DERRICK.

In one, two, three: THE DERRICK CATCHES TO FIRE AND ALL THE OIL
BECOMES A FLAME. It’s as if a FLAME THROWER is coming up from
under ground.

This catches to the oil that’s spilled all around. BLACK SMOKE
FILLS THE AIR.

He watches the FIRE coming straight towards him.

TEACHER
Can he read?

DANIEL
NO...

TEACHER

does he know a few words?
to read — are their words that
he can recognize?

DANIEL
I don’t know.

TEACHER
did he go to school?

DANIEL
He's smarter than any child
you've ever met.
63

TEACHER
Our facility —

DANIEL
I don’t want him to go anywhere,
I want you to come here.

TEACHER
The school that we have in San
Francisco has other children
and that would be a very good
place for him. He can be with
other children and we have six
other teachers.

DANIEL
I will build you a school here and you
can bring all the children down.
I'm offering to build you a school that’s
anything you want it to be.

TEACHER
Yes, but, these children have families
in San Francisco.

DANIEL
We'll bring their families.
We can build a school that is the
best in this State. In this country.
You're the best teacher they say,
so why don’t you have your own school?

TEACHER
I live in San Francisco.

DANIEL
Not anymore. I’ll have a temporary
school built in one month and once
you’re here we can make plans for a
larger place to be built within
a year. I’1l pay you two thousand dollars
in salary and build you a home as well.
Does this sound fine to you?

TEACHER
No. It doesn’t. You need to send
your son to San Francisco if you
want him to learn how to deal with
what’s happened. He needs to go to
school.
75

DANIEL
yes or no?

TEACHER
No, sir.

DANIEL

I'm only going to ask you once.

TEACHER
You already have. Building a school
here may be better for you but it’s
not better for you boy.

DANIEL
Well then get out of here. get out.
I’1l have someone get you back to
San Francisco.

TEACHER

You don’t want me to see him?
DANIEL

No.
TEACHER

I’ve come a long way because you asked
for me personally and Mr. Brodie suggested —

That’s all over. Someone will get you back

He SLAPS HIM AGAIN, WITH OPEN HAND, STRAIGHT ACROSS HIS FACE.
Eli starts to well with tears from the FORCE OF THIS BRUTAL
SLAP.

HOLD. Everything is still for a moment. He SLAPS HIM AGAIN.
Eli moves back, goes down to his knees.

DANIEL
aren't you a healer and a vessel
for the holy spirit? When are you
coming over and make my son hear again?
CAN'T YOU DO THAT?

ELI
You should have let me bless the well,
this wouldn’t have happened to him —
HE SLAPS ELI AGAIN, STRAIGHT ACROSS THE FACE.

ELI
you shouldn’t have done that--

He SLAPS HIM AGAIN. Everyone is standing around. Silenced.

ELI

You owe the Church of the Third

Revelation five thousand dollars

as part of the arrangement that we made.

ELI
You are such a stupid man, Abel.

REVERSE, THAT MOMENT, ABEL. He looks across the table
at his son.

ELI
You've let someone come in here
and walk all over us.
You've let him in and do his work
here and you're a stupid man for
what we could have had. Nothing
but goats and rocks and all the time
we were rich.

ABEL
I followed His word, Eli..I’ve tried —

ELI
you didn’t do anything but sit down.
You're lazy and you’re stupid.
(beat )
Do you think God is going to come down
here and save you for being stupid? He doesn’t
save stupid people, Abel.

Eli PUSHES THE TABLE IN FRONT OF HIM AND SLAMS IT TOWARDS ABEL,
PUSHING IT BACK AND PINNING HIM AGAINST THE WALL.

ELI JUMPS UP, MOVES TOWARDS HIM, ABEL IS TERRIFYED.
ELI
I WILL TEAR YOU APART FOR WHAT YOU'VE DONE.

ELI
How did he come here? Do you want to know?
I KNOW. I HAVE SEEN THIS IN A VISION.
It was your stupid son. It was Paul who
told him to come here. I know it. He told
him to come here and he told him what he could
take you for. He went to him and he said,
“My stupid, weak father will give away
his lots — go and take him — “ and you let
it happen -- from a stupid father

I want from them and it makes me sick;
Because I see that all people are lazy.

They’re easy to take...

I want to make enough money that I
can move far away from everyone.

HENRY
What will you do about your boy?

DANIEL
I don’t know. Maybe it will change.
Does your sound come back to you?

ELI
I truly wish that everyone could

The doctrine of universal salvation is a lie.
I wish everyone would be saved,
but they won’t! No They Won’t!
You will never be saved if what -- ?

NOW IS THERE A SINNER HERE LOOKING
FOR SALVATION? A NEW MEMBER?

Your child that you raised, you
have abandoned all because he was
sick and you have sinned — so say

Don’t bully me Daniel, please. HELP ME.
PLEASE. MY FAITH HAS BEEN LOST AND I NEED
A NEW WAY. I ASK FOR YOUR HELP --

IN A FLASH: DANIEL is UP AND HAS GRABBED ELI AND THROWN HIM
HALFWAY ACROSS THE ROOM. Eli flails about as Daniel closes in,
hysterical/crazy/kicking/pushing,etc..

DANIEL
I TOOK WHAT I WANTED WHEN YOU WEREN’T LOOKING
AND THE BLOOD OF THE LAMB IS IN MY POCKET.
DO YOU THINK GOD IS GOING TO BALANCE
YOUR INVESTMENTS? GOD DOESN’T SAVE IDIOTS, ELI.
YOU ARE BROKE AND YOU ARE LAME AND
YOU ARE DONE FOR.

ELI
No I’m not.

DANIEL
DID YOU THINK THAT YOUR SONG AND DANCE
AND YOUR SUPERSTITION WOULD SAVE YOU?
I AM THE THIRD REVELATION! I AM
WHO THE LORD HAS CHOSEN. BECAUSE I’M
SMARTER THAN YOU. I AM OLDER AND WISER
AND I AM NOT A FALSE PROPHET, YOU
SNIVELING BOY. YOU'RE DONE FOR.

ELI
Not done for, no.

DANIEL
YES.

ANGLE, DANIEL.

along the way, he picks up a HEAVY SILVER TUMBLER...

DANIEL
I AM THE THIRD REVELATION! I AM THE
THIRD REVELATION! I TOLD YOU I WOULD EAT
YOU UP, I TOLD YOU I WOULD EAT YOU.
HOW DARE YOU COME TO ME? HOW DARE YOU?

WHAT DID I TELL YOU?

ANGLE, ELI. :
inching back on the bowling alley floor..back from Daniel...

DANIEL
WHAT DID I TELL YOU?

ANGLE, DANIEL.
advancing on Eli...

DANIEL
I TOLD YOU I‘D EAT YOU UP.

ANGLE, ELI
crawling and looking for somewhere to go..

DANIEL
How dare you come to my home?

DANIEL is over HIM, AND SITS ON HIS CHEST, PINNING DOWN HIS
ARMS..AND DRIVES THE TUMBLER STRAIGHT DOWN INTO ELI’S FACE.

CAMERA looks STRAIGHT DOWN on the GORGEOUS WOOD FLOOR...

«very slowly, BLOOD COMES OOZING INTO FRAME. It spreads and
moves like a slow land slide..covering the floor..CAMERA moves
back a bit to reveal;

«blood pouring from Eli’s skull and this head wound..he’s curled
in a fetal position and not moving..

CU. DANIEL.
his eyes wet and out of breath from the struggle, looking at
what he’s done. HOLD. He gets up --

Daniel drags Eli's dead body down the lane of the bowling alley,
leaving a streak of BLOOD...

HE THROWS HIM INTO THE BOWLING PINS AND DOWN OVER THE LIP INTO
A CELLAR.

FROM BELOW, LOOKING UP. 138A

BOWLING PINS AND ELI’S BODY COME CRASHING THROUGH INTO THIS
CELLAR.
138B ABOVE, IN THE BOWLING LANE.

Daniel slumps down onto the floor..breathing heavy
blood.. HOLD WITH HIM ON HIS FACE.

ANGLE, AT THE STEPS LEADING TO THE BOWLING ALLEY.

CAMERA pulls back with AL ROSE coming down the
steps..slowly..slowly..revealing to him the horrific

--and sees the BLOOD spilled across the floor..and
HOLD on Al’s face and the reality of this mess...
Daniel turns around..satisfied:

DANIEL
I'm finished.

THE END.
