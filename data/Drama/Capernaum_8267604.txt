INT. DAY - UNSANITARY POLICE DETENTION CENTER 1.

Ina small unsanitary office, used as a police station, stands Zain, a skinny
12-year-old boy, slightly hunchbacked, wearing only his dirty underwear
and looking lost. The boy stands there with his mouth wide open while a

40-year-old doctor examines his teeth like one examines a lab rat.

DOCTOR (TALKING TO ZAIN)
Tilt your head up.

DOCTOR (TALKING TO ANOTHER MAN OFF
CAMERA)
He's lost his baby teeth. I'd say he's at least 12 years old, maybe
13.

Among the women, a young Ethiopian girl - Tigest (Rahil) - with short hair
seems in shock more than others, but she tries to control herself. She has a
dripping black mark on her cheek.
OFFICER
Who's Tigest Ailo?
The Ethiopian, Tigest Ailo?

OFFICER (TALKING TO TIGEST)
Are you Tigest?

A chaotic atmosphere fills the room. Zain follows Nadine, his lawyer. Nadine
is dressed in her attorney attire and holds a bag. She sits next to him. Nadine

THE JUDGE

THE JUDGE
Childish? He was sentenced to five years! He committed a
crime. Childish? Anyway...
How old are you, Zain?

ZAIN
I don't know? Ask them.

Souad puts her head down and avoids looking at the lawyer. Nadine steps
closer to the judge and presents the forensic doctor’s medical certificate.
NADINE (PRESENTS THE REPORT)
Your Honor, Zain has no birth certificate, and has never been
registered with the state.
And his parents apparently don't know his exact date of birth...
Here's the medical examiner's report that states that Zain was
approximately 12 years old at the time of the incident.

THE JUDGE (WHILE LOOKING AT THE REPORT)

So he's 12 years old?
NADINE
Correct.
THE JUDGE

We see laundry hanging through the steel bars of several windows. They
are hanging on a cracked facade of an old building. A man calls Souad
from one of the prison windows. Souad looks up to spot the guy. She is
holding her daughter in a hand and bags in another. Zain looks up and
smiles at his cousin.

MAN
Aunt Souad?
Over here!

SOUAD
Who's that? Massoud?
Howare you?

MASSOUD
How are you, my darling?

SOUAD
Isn't my son Ibrahim with you?

The one year old makes babbling sound.

She's trying to talk to you!
Wave him goodbye.
Wave.

illegal.

Souad and Zain pass by a long line of visitors, talking on the phones. Their
combined voices create a loud noise in the corridor.

Souad lays down her baby girl and smokes a cigarette, while Zain is
standing next to her.

On the other side of the glass windows where the inmates sit, a young

man holds the telephone and speaks to Souad.

IBRAHIM (OVER THE TELEPHONE)
Mom, we raised the price to $15 a shot now.
Our hands are messed up from wringing out the clothes.

SOUAD (SPEAKING ON THE PHONE TO HER
SON)
So now our special juice is worth more than a kilo of meat!

SOUAD (WITH PRIDE)
Good for you!
18.

Chaos fills the hall. The mother is still talking to her son but we can’t
hear the conversation anymore. The little girl is playing with a toy,
while Zain, who seems sad, is lost in his thoughts.

EXT.DAY-IN FRONT OF ASSAD’S MARKET 18.

In the mid-day heat, Zain is struggling to unload heavy gallons froma

little truck.
A young man in his twenties, Assad appears behind him.

ASSAD
Hurry up! Let's go.

While Zain carries boxes, a small van passes by. The kids’ backpacks are
tied outside of the van onto the bumper and the side mirrors. The van
stops, not far from Zain. A young lady gets down making way for the
children to exit. The lady gets in the van again while looking
disappointed at Zain.

STUDENT
Do we have a test tomorrow?

THE YOUNG LADY
Check your notebook.

Zain puts two gallons of water in an old stroller. He is getting ready to
leave the market when Assad hands him two cartons of cigarettes.

ASSAD
These are for your mother...
And these are for my beautiful Sahar.
I miss her.

In another bag, Assad puts ramen noodles and liquorice.

ZAIN
Thank you.

ASSAD
Take care.

Zain leaves carrying all the bags.
19. EXT.AFTERNOON-THE NEIGHBORHOOD 19.

On his way, he angrily throws the bag of snacks in a carton box on the
street and heads home. A confused man is seen checking what Zain threw.

buildings and lower-class people.

Zain gets inside the building, while a young girl was standing outside.

screams as he walks up the stairway.

21. INT.AFTERNOON-ZAIN’S HOME 21.
Souad is cursing and mopping the floor filled with water.

SOUAD
Assaad's father, that asshole.
Every time he fills the water tank, we drown because of his
rotten pipes!
That bastard thinks we owe him for letting us live here for free.

Ayoung girl is holding a broom, while two older ones are helping their
mother get rid of the water filling up the house. The door is open. Zain
knocks on a door using his head. He is holding the grocery bags with his
hands.

ZAIN
Sahar!

SOUAD (ANGRILY)
This isn't a house, it's a pigsty!
To hell with you all.

Sahar opens the door and helps her brother with the water gallons.

SOUAD (SHOUTING AT HER DAUGHTERS)
Get out of here.
You'll all be electrocuted! Out!
This house is a curse!
In the corner of the room, Selim, Zain’s father is sitting on a chair while
his wife is cursing and two of their daughters are sitting on a wretched
and dirty couch.

SELIM (REPLYING TO SOUAD)
So go live on the street, there's plenty of room!

Zain’s little sister is loudly crying. Her foot is chained.

SOUAD (SHOUTING AT ZAIN)
Zain, why are the vegetables rotten?
Did you upset Assaad?

Zain stands up and unties his little sister’s foot. He holds her and takes
her to another room. She stops crying.

SAHAR
Zain, did he give you liquorice and ramen for me?

24. INT.DAY- ZAIN’S HOME 24.

In the other room, Zain’s six sisters and brothers are helping their mother
squeeze the juice.

LITTLE SISTER
Wake up, Zain!

ZAIN
It's dawn.
Leave me the fuck alone!

LITTLE SISTER
Wake up, you donkey!

When he wakes up, Zain discovers a bloodstain on the mattress next to
him. He smells it then checks whether he injured his arm. He becomes
worried and lost in thought.

25. EXT.DAY-STREET 25.

Zain and his sisters are heading to the sidewalk holding pails and
buckets. He is also holding a rectangular piece of wood.

Juice of all juices, for multiple uses!

A boy buys one cup.
Sahar is holding her youngest sister. The two other sisters, are selling
cups of juice, while Zain is sitting and lost in his thoughts.

In the dirty, broken down public restrooms, Zain is scrubbing his sister’s
underwear over the sink. Sahar is sitting on the toilet seat.

ZAIN
Remember what happened to your friend, Alia? Her mother
locked her in the house until some pig came and took her away.
f Mom finds out, she'll get rid of you. She'll give you to Assad.

SAHAR
But Assaad's really nice.
ZAIN
He's a fart!
SAHAR (NAIVE)

But he gives me ramen and liquorice for free.

ZAIN
He'll give you shit to eat! They'll give you to Assaad to get rid of
you. We'll never see you again. He'll lock you up in aroom full
of rats, and cover the windows. You'll never go outside. Every
three days, he'll give you a drop of water and expired ramen.
Didn't you see his ear? A sewer rat bit him.

 

Sahar looks scared. Zain tries drying his sister’s underwear.

ZAIN
Here, put this on.

He takes off his t-shirt, folds it and puts it in his sister’s panties.

ZAIN
Are you done?

Yeah.

standing in front of her smoking a cigarette.

Buildings and balconies around them are in a very poor state.

On a rooftop we see a young girl carrying a gallon. On a balcony, a group
of children playing with papers.

space.

Sahar and Zain are walking together. Sahar is eating Ramen Noodles.

ZAIN
Careful. Don't just throw the pads anywhere, I'll show you
where to hide them. I'll show you? Got it?

We see Zain and Sahar going down the street. Sahar is walking
uncomfortably. She is scratching her backside because her short is still
wet.

32. EXT.EVENING-SIDEWALK 32.

In a crowded street of this neighborhood, several plastic cups are filled
with a vegetable juice colored like beets and lined up in front of Zain who
sings funny Arabic rhymes promoting the juices that they are selling. Next
to him, his little sister is selling juice to people walking by as well.

ZAIN
Beetroot juice, better than booze!
Tomato juice, makes you loose!
That's 250.

her. With a sad look in his eyes, Zain is sitting on a rope and watching his
sister.

SAHAR (ADDRESSING THE MAN)
What do you want?

MAN
I wanna show you something.

SAHAR
Leave me alone.

MAN
Come on, just for a bit!

SOUAD
Why are you complicating things?
Let him go and learn a word or two.
Go sit next to your sister, but don't wake her up.
Let him go to school.
They'll give us some food and clothes.

SELIM
And what do we tell Assad?

ZAIN
Assaad? I'll talk to him. I'll go to school in the morning, and
work for him in the afternoon.

SOUAD
Haven't you seen Zahra's son, Farid? He comes back from
school loaded with stuff. We'll get mattresses, clothes for the
kids...

SELIM
Shut up!

SOUAD
At least he'll eat there and bring food for his sisters. Leftovers
from the fanciest hotels and weddings. It'll be good for all of us!
Why are you being so stubborn?

SELIM
God willing, we'll see on Monday.

SOUAD
God willing?

SELIM
Want me to swear on the bread? I said ok. What if Assaad gets
upset and kicks us out?

48. INT.DAY-KITCHEN 48.
Angry Zain enters the kitchen to see his mother preparing juice.

ZAIN (ANGRILY)

Calm down. He's discussing the rent with your father.

ZAIN
I'd bet my arm you're trading these chickens for Sahar.

SOUAD
Listen to me, wait...

ZAIN (TALKING ABOUT ASSAD)
Tell that sonofabitch he has no business here.

SOUAD (GRABS ZAIN’S ARM)
Understand what I'm saying?

ZAIN
Go tell him or I will.

SOUAD
Keep your voice down. I swear on your sisters, | swear to God...
It's nothing, it's all in your head.

ZAIN
So why's Sahar wearing makeup?

SOUAD
She's imitating me for fun.

One of his sisters is listening to the conversation from behind.

ZAIN
When they finish their juice, I'm kicking them out.

SOUAD (HOLDS HIS FACE)
Listen, don't make me crazy, got it?

ZAIN (WHILE HIS MOTHER KICKS HIM)
Go tell him it's not happening. Tell him or else I will.

A little girl is eating powder milk directly from the box with a spoon.
Around her lie more scattered shoes. Zain gets closer to her and signals
her to stay quiet and not to make any noise so that no one wakes up. He
holds a garbage bag. He removes his slippers. All his other sisters are
crammed and asleep. He climbs carefully so he doesn’t wake them up,
and opens a drawer and takes some of Sahar’s old underwears and puts
them in the bag. He goes to another drawer and takes clothes. He finds a
white dress between them. He keeps it inside. Zain comes closer to
Sahar.

ZAIN (WHISPERING IN SAHAR’S EAR)
Sahar... Sahar! Wake up, we're going somewhere.

SAHAR (TRYING TO WAKE UP)
Where?

ZAIN
I'll tell you later. Be ready when I come back. Don't tell anyone.
He picks the pile of clothes and puts the in the blue garbage bag. He
takes a glimpse at her then goes.

INT.DAY-LIVING ROOM 65.

He takes a few thousands liras from his father’s wallet and takes the bag
and leaves.

66. INT.DAY-MARKET 66.

In the back of the market, Zain discreetly picks up some canned food,
little bit of bread, sanitary napkins, and puts them in the same garbage
bag. On his way out, he drops the actual garbage bags and keeps the one
that contains clothes and food with him and leaves.

67. EXT.DAY-BUS STATION 83.
In the noontime heat, carrying his bag, Zain runs to one of the parked
busses at a bus station.

ZAIN (TO THE DRIVER)
How much to get to Cola Area?

DRIVER
1,000.

ZAIN
If I put my sister in my lap, can you take us for 1,000?

DRIVER
Where's your sister?

ZAIN
At home, I'll go get her now.

DRIVER
No problem, go and get her.

Zain runs back home.

68. INT.DAY-STAIRS OF ZAIN’S BUILDING 68.
Zain runs up the stairs quickly. He hears screaming and shouting.

SAHAR (BEGGING AND CRYING)
Please, don't make me go! I don't want to, I beg you! Please
don't make me go!

SOUAD (SCREAMING AT HER)
If you come back, I'll beat the crap out of you.

Zain runs into Souad who is hurrying down the stairs pushing Sahar and
carrying her girl’s belongings by one hand, and in the other hand holding
one of her toddlers.

ZAIN (SHOUTING AT HIS MOTHER)
Where are you taking her, you bastards? You're sending her to
be that asshole's maid?

SAHAR (SHE RUNS AND HIDES BEHIND HIM)
I want to stay with my brother.

SOUAD
It's none of your business.

ZAIN
She's just a kid, Mom!

SOUAD (WHILE HITTING ZAIN)
Mind your own business. Get out of the way! Butt out. Go
down! One more move and I'll kill you. I know what you've
been hiding. You were about to get us into deep shit.

Souad rushes down and hits Zain again. Zain then follows them back
down and holds his sister’s hand. They are fighting on the stairway.

ZAIN
You want her to wipe that pig's ass!

SOUAD
Fuck off! Get out of my face! Go down! Let go of her!

ZAIN
She's not going to Assaad!

Zain takes Sahar and runs back to the house and closes the door. His
mother follows them, opens the door, and drags Sahar by her hand.

SOUAD
You little bastard! Open the door, you little shit!

SAHAR
I don't want to go, Mom! I don't want to go! Leave me alone!
I'm begging you, Mom! Don't make me go!

Souad puts her toddler down, hits Zain and shouts at him.

SOUAD
Sahar, come right now! Enough! Stop it, get the hell down!

SAHAR
I want to stay, I beg you.

SOUAD
Get downstairs! Downstairs! Get downstairs!
SAHAR
Mom, I beg you, please!

SOUAD
Little bastard.

Zain, on the ground, is in pain. He stands up and keeps on trying to stop
his mother from sending her to Assad. Selim shows up and starts cursing
and shouting.

SELIM
Damn you all!

He grabs Sahar and carries her on his back.

SAHAR (CRYING)
I don't want to go, Mom!

SELIM
Enough! Enough of this hell!

69. EXT.DAY- IN FRONT OF ZAIN’S BUILDING 69.

Selim grabs his daughter and gets on his moped. Souad puts Sahar and
her belongings behind him while he gets ready to leave. Kids around them
are crying.

SELIM
Put her on! One more word and I'll cut your tongue out!

Zain tries to stop the moped, while his mother is hitting him and shouting.

SAHAR (HITTING HER FATHER)
No!

Zain runs after them, while his mother is standing and looking at them
from behind.

ZAIN (SCREAMING)
Sahar! Sahar!
SOUAD
Let her go!

Zain has tears in his eyes and a lump in his throat. A few neighbors step
out to observe the scene from afar without reaction.

ZAIN (WITH TEARS IN HIS EYES)
Are you happy now?

Zain tries to break a wooden door. His mother starts shouting at him and
hitting him.

SOUAD
Acting like a man now? I'll show you, you little piece of crap!

He runs away so she starts to follow him and shout. She grabs a slipper
and throws it at him.

70. EXT.DAY-ON THE STREETS 70.

Zain is running on the street enraged, with tears in his eyes.

BACK TO THE COURT

71. INT.DAY-COURTROOM 71.

SELIM (WITH TEARS IN HIS EYES)
To get her out of her misery. She's dead with us, your Honor.
She barely has a bed to sleep in. She hardly eats or drinks,
barely showers... Never watches TV. I thought, "Marry her off.
At least she'll have a bed." A real bed. With a blanket. She'll eat.

THE JUDGE
You didn't expect it would lead to this?

SELIM (CRYING; ZAIN LOOKS AT HIM, SAD)
No, never! I never meant for this to happen. Think I'm happy
my son stabbed someone? Ever think that maybe all this is not
our fault? I was born and raised this way. Why blame me? If I
had the choice, I'd be a better man than all of you!
DEFENSE LAWYER
You can't speak this way.

SELIM
If you please... When I walk outside, I'll be covered with spit.
People think I'm an animal. I never intended any of this. I was
told: "Without children, you're not a man." "Your children will
be your backbone." But they broke my back, broke my heart
and humiliated me. I curse the day I got married. Why did I get
myself into this?

72. INT.DAY-BUS 72.

Shots of the sky and clouds taken from inside. Lost in his thoughts, Zain
sits in the bus with a sad look in his eyes. The bus stops and we can see
an old man wearing a fake spider-man costume. The man (Harout), holds
a cigarette in his hands and sits by Zain’s side. Zain looks at him. He’s
surprised to see him there. Zain looks at him fora long time.

HAROUT
I'm not him, dear. I just look like him.

ZAIN (STILL SURPRISED)
Yeah, but there should bea spider there, not a cockroach.
Right?

HAROUT (SMOKING)
I don't need a spider. I'm Cockroach-Man. What would I need a
spider for? That's right. I'm Cockroach-Man.

ZAIN (LOOKING OUTSIDE THE WINDOW)
So how are you related to Spiderman?

HAROUT
How are we related? I'm his cousin.

ZAIN
So you're his cousin?

HAROUT
That's right, I'm his cousin. What's your name?

ZAIN
Zain.
HAROUT

Hussein?
ZAIN
Zain!
HAROUT
Zain! Where are you going, Zain?
ZAIN
To my grandma's.
HAROUT
Speak up.
ZAIN

To my grandma's!

HAROUT
To your grandma's? She's lucky to have you. Nobody really
cares about me. My life is...

BUS DRIVER (TO HAROUT)
Please, sir, your cigarette!

HAROUT (TO THE DRIVER)
Please. Slow down, sir. I'd like to get off here, please.

Zain sneaks on Harout’s destination. He sees him entering an amusement

ZAIN
Wait, wait. Stop, sir. I'd like to get off here, too.

73. EXT.DAY-IN FRONT OF AN OLD AMUSEMENT PARK 73.

A woman (Daad) is selling corn on her stand and shouting phrases to
promote her corns and attract clients.

DAAD
Corn on the cob, God's favorite crop!
74. EXT.DAY-AN OLD AMUSEMENT PARK 74.
Zain is searching for Harout around the park. Music is playing in the
background.
ZAIN
Mr. Cockroach-Man?
Zain is still looking around; he is observing the amusement park rides
while dragging his plastic bag behind him. He stops by one of the rides.
75. EXT.DAY- ON A FERRIS WHEEL RIDE 75.
Zain is sitting on a seat of the ferris wheel ride that rises above the floor.
His eyes are filled with tears. We see shots of the sunrise taken from

Zain is sleeping on a plastic bag on the floor under one of the rides’ seats,
with ramen noodles pack in his hand. When awake, he eats the remains
of the noodles, and then throws the empty packet on the ground.

Then, he lies in one of the rides’ seats, barefoot, facing a huge woman
statue decorating and attached in the middle of the game.

Zain, who is holding his plastic bag, gets inside. He sees Rahil, who is
sweeping the floor.

RAHIL (SMILING)
What do you want from him?
82. INT.DAY-RESTAURANT TABLE 82.

Zain is eating a sandwich and drinking tea. In front of him sits Rahil, who
gave him the food.

ZAIN (SAD)
Anything, really. I just need work.
RAHIL
What's your name?

RAHIL
I'm Tigest.
83. EXT.DAY-IN FRONT OF BAKERY 83.

BAKER

84, EXT.DAY-IN FRONT OF SNACK 84,
Desperate Zain is dragging his plastic bag and roaming the streets
looking for a job. He stops by a snack. The employee offers him food but
Zain refuses.
ZAIN
Do you have any work for me?

85. EXT.DAY-ON THE STREET 85.

ZAIN (TO A FISHERMAN)
Do you need someone to help you hold your fishing rod?

FISHERMAN
Where are your parents? Your parents?

Zain doesn’t reply. He looks the other way.

86. EXT.EVENNING-IN FRONT OF A SNACK 86.
Several customers are standing and waiting for their orders.

ZAIN
Sir, do you have a juice or something for 250? Something for
250?

WORKER
Juice costs 1,000.

ZAIN
Have anything cheaper?

WORKER
No.

Zain stands there and stares at the food.

CUSTOMER (OFFERINGI ZAIN A SANDWICH)
Take it... Take it. Go ahead, come on, just take it.

87. EXT.EVENING- AMUSEMENT PARK 87.

Zain heads back to the amusement park. He stares at the naked statue
swinging around, with seats full of screaming kids. His eyes are
bloodshot from fatigue and lack of sleep.

Rahil is looking at him from above, while sweeping the floor. Then they
exchange looks.

88. INT.NIGHT-AMUSEMENT PARK’S RESTROOMS 88.

Rahil works as a women’s bathroom maid, She sits next to the sink. When
a woman enters the bathroom, she stands up.

RAHIL
It's occupied, ma'am.

WOMAN
It's occupied?

RAHIL
Yes, and this one's out of service.

Rahil is waiting for the woman to wash her hands. She holds tissues. We
can see a box for tips, and a basket filled with candy.

A loud noise comes out of one of the rides outside.

We hear babbling coming from the stall that she said was not working.
She climbs on the chair to check behind the door.

She breastfeeds her son. When Yonas looks at her and smiles, she kisses
him on his cheek.

NT.NIGHT- AMUSEMENT PARK’S RESTROOMS 93.

trolley and struggles to cover it with her son’s movements, then leaves.

EXT.NIGHT- AMUSEMENT PARK STAIRWAY 94.

She carries the trolley and goes upstairs to leave the park.

 

EXT.NIGHT-SIDEWALK 95.

Looking anxious, Rahil walks down the sidewalk and drags a trolley
behind her while carrying plastic bags. Zain follows her. She hears Zain’s
voice from behind.

ZAIN
Tigest? Tigest? Do you have any food? Please.
Rahil looks at Zain from head to toe. Then she thinks whether she should
take him home with her or not.

96. INT.DAY-RAHIL’S BATHROOM 96.

On an old bathroom floor, Rahil gives Yonas and Zain a shower. After
shower, Zain is covered in a towel, while she dries her son with another
one. Zain is scanning the house.

97. INT.NIGHT-RAHIL’S HOME 97.

Zain is wearing a jacket having dinner quietly. Rahil sits in front of him
while Yonas sits on her knees. He babbles.

RAHIL
Zain.

Rahil kisses Yonas, who puts his hand inside her t-shirt because he is
used to her breastfeeding him.

98. INT.NIGHT-RAHIL’S HOME 98.

In the dark, Rahil takes out some cash from one of the copper bars of her
bed. She counts the money using her cell phone’s light. She seems
thoughtful. Further down the room, with his eyes half open, Zain observes
her without her knowing.

99, EXT.DAY-STREET 99.
A shot of an old man is sipping coffee on a table in a small, unorganized
store.

100. EXT.DAY-POOR NEIGHBORHOOD 100.
A shot of two veiled women carrying heavy objects on their back and
walking in an extremely poor neighborhood. The houses are made of

very bad condition. Two kids are playing around.
101. INT.DAY-RAHIL’S BATHROOM 101.

On top of the sink, there is a bottle full of milk. We see Rahil with her back
turned and breast pumping a second bottle of milk.

102. INT.DAY-RAHIL’S HOME 102.

Annoyed Zain is sitting on the couch, while Yonas is heard babbling and
playing in an inflatable pool. Zain turns one of the toys that emit sound
and lights on to distract Yonas who directly starts moving his hands and
dancing.

103. INT.DAY-RAHIL’S BATHROOM 103.

Rahil pretends to be getting ready. She observes Zain from the corner of
her eye through the gap of the bathroom door that she kept slightly open.
Zain seems to be very comfortable with Yonas. She grabs the bottles and
leaves the bathroom.

104. INT.DAY-RAHIL’S HOME 104.

RAHIL (WHILE CARRYING YONAS)
Zain, the milk's here. Give him the first bottle at 11(she shows
him number eleven on the clock), and the other one at 2
(shows him the number two)... I'll be back at 3.

105. INT.DAY-BATHROOM 105.

Rahil is getting ready in front of the mirror. Using her black kohl, she
draws a beauty mark on her cheek. Next to her is an ID with the picture of
a woman with the same visible beauty mark on her face.

106. INT.DAY-RAHIL’S HOME 106.
She burns some incense, takes her son from Zain’s arms, kisses him and
places him in the inflatable pool. She whispers some tender words in

Ethiopian asking him to be a good boy and not to give Zain a hard time.

RAHIL (CARRIES YONAS AND CLOSES WINDOW)
Don't leave the house, ok? Please don't let Yonas cry a lot. Our
neighbor's a pain.

RAHIL (SPEAKING ETHIOPIAN TO HER CRYING
SON)
Stay with your friend. I'll be back, Yoni. This is your new friend
now, okay? Zain is your new friend.

RAHIL (SWINGING YONAS IN HER ARMS)
Are you sleepy?

She breastfeeds her son one last time before she leaves. Zain looks the
other way. We hear her neighbor's loud shouting outside. Rahil observes
Zain without his knowing.

107. INT.DAY-RAHIL’S HOME 107.

Yonas is sobbing. Zain grabs some biscuits and puts them ina plastic
plate for Yonas and keeps some for himself. Then, he opens the window
and looks outside, while Yonas eats the biscuits. Later on, Zain feeds
Yonas the milk.

108. INT.DAY-RESTAURANT KITCHEN 108.

Rahil is energetically cleaning the plates. She chats with her Ethiopian
colleague about her working permit.

COLLEAGUE (SPEAKING ETHIOPIAN)
Tell him you don't have that kind of money.

RAHIL (SPEAKING ETHIOPIAN)
I did, but he said no less than $1,500. I have to get a new one
soon, mine is about to expire.

COLLEAGUE (SPEAKING ETHIOPIAN)
Do it right away, you'll be in real trouble without a permit. A lot
of girls are getting arrested now, sometimes in the middle of
the night.

109. INT.NIGHT-RAHIL’S HOME 109.
Zain, wearing dishwashing gloves tries to change Yonas’s diapers with a
disgusted look on his face. Yonas is not sitting still; he is moving around
and standing up.

ZAIN
You smell like shit, you little shit. Stop! Sit down. Sit down!

Yonas is sobbing, so Zain turns the toy on. The child starts dancing.
ZAIN (BECAUSE YONAS IS MOVING AROUND)
It slipped.
(Referring to the diaper)

Zain is drumming on the back of a cooker to entertain Yonas, who starts
imitating him.

ZAIN (SINGING TO YONAS AND SWINGING HIM)
Go to sleep, go to sleep... Come on, sleep.

Zain falls asleep inside the inflatable pool, while Yonas stays up.

110. INT.DAY-RESTAURANT KITCHEN 110.

At the end of her shift, Rahil finishes washing the last dish. She looks
around to see if someone was looking at her. She takes a box of a cake,
and hides it in an empty garbage bag.

111. IN FRONT OF AMUSEMENT PARK 111.

Rahil passes in front of the entrance of the amusement park. When Rahil
waves Daad goodbye, she invites her over corn.

DAAD
Have some corn, darling!

Harout is being animated as usual. He has a cigarette hanging out of his
mouth. He tries to attract people passing by.

Come on in, everybody! Welcome!
DAAD
It's sizzling hot! Sizzling!
112. INT.AFTERNOON-BUS 112.

In the dark, Rahil is sitting in front of the cake with the burning candles
that light up Zain’s face, who’s showing neither a happy, nor sad
expression.

RAHIL (ADDRESSING YONAS)
Blow, blow.

RAHIL (ADDRESSING ZAIN)
Blow it out, Zain.

Rahil claps her hands for Zain, who smiles at her. Yonas imitates Rahil
and claps with her, so they both smile and she kisses her son. His face is

glowing the candlelight. Zain eats a piece of cake.

RAHIL (YONAS SLEEPING ON HER CHEST)
How old are you, Zain?

ZAIN
I don't know, maybe 12.

RAHIL
How many brothers and sisters do you have?

ZAIN (SARCASTIC)

Alot.

RAHIL
Where's your sister now?
ZAIN
With her husband.
RAHIL

I was afraid the police would take my son away and deport me.
That's why I didn't tell anyone.

THE JUDGE
So you'd leave Yonas with Zain when you went to work. Was he
taking good care of your baby? Never thought he might harm
him?

RAHIL
I was a little scared the first couple of days, but then I started
to really trust him.

THE JUDGE
You never expected Zain could do what he did?

RAHIL
Never. They were like brothers. But I don't blame Zain, because
I know what Aspro is like.

THE JUDGE
Who is this Aspro?

 

RAHIL
The man who forged my permit.

118. EXT.DAY-SUNDAY FLEA MARKET 118.

Rahil is walking through the narrow alleys of the souks where several
kiosks are selling a little bit of everything... counterfeit merchandise,
electronics, watches, and cheap kinky underwear. The people attending
this market are the lower class foreign workers including poorly dressed
immigrant construction workers.

119. EXT.DAY-IN FRONT OF A CELL PHONE ACCESSORIES STORE 119.

Rahil approaches a kiosk that sells accessories and gadgets. Behind the
counter Aspro, a forty-year-old man, who has one blue eye and one
brown eye, and the look of a crook. When he sees Rahil he speaks
sarcastically. Rahil seems scared and weak.

ASPRO
Didn't I say I'd only give you till today?
RAHIL (WITH TEARS IN HER EYES)
But I talked to my friend, and she only paid $900 for her
permit.

ASPRO
Let your friend get you a permit.

RAHIL
No, I'm just wondering why it's so much more expensive?

ASPRO
Wait, wait, wait. Don't try to fasttalk me. Let me get a word in.
I'm trying to help you. Who changed your name to Tigest? I did.
Run over to your friend who says she can get it for $900. Don't
act smart.

RAHIL
Please understand, I couldn't get $1,500.

ASPRO (SHOWS RAHIL A PERMIT)
Look at this? Does this look fake? No one will bother you with
this. The woman who this belonged to... BOOM! Blew up ina
million pieces. She had no one, no family. Nobody claimed the
body. You wouldn't have to fake your beauty mark anymore.

RAHIL
Ok, but give me more time.

ASPRO
Sweetheart, I've already told you I can save you the $1,500. Just
give me Yonas and your permit's free.

RAHIL (ANGRY)
Don't ever mention Yonas again, that will never happen. Never!

ASPRO
That boy lives like a fugitive here on this soil. If they ever find
out about him, you'll both get expelled. You keep him
underground like a rat. The boy never sees the sun, he'll never
go to school. I want him to have a father and a mother. He'd
still be your son. You could see him...

RAHIL
I know what's best for my son, how to hide him, I know how to
feed and care for him.

ASPRO
I'm telling you your boy is dead before he's even born! He
doesn't exist. Even a ketchup bottle has a name. It has a
production and expiration date.

RAHIL
I can't hear this anymore.
ASPRO
How much more money do you need?
RAHIL
500 dollars.
ASPRO

You still need $500? I can buy a human being with $500. So you
don’t say that Aspro ripped you off, I’m gonna reduce the price
by $200. I'm giving you seven days. You either bring me the
money, or your son. Or I don't want to see your pretty little
face here again. Understand? So go ahead, take your time. As
much fucking time as you want.

122. INT.DAY-RAHIL’S HOME 122.

Yonas is sobbing. Zain is looking outside the window. He sees the
neighbor’s TV through their open window and an animated series is
playing. He adjusts the window so Yonas can watch the show through the
reflection on the glass. Yonas starts watching and calms down a bit. Zain
sits next to him and starts making dialogue with funny voices and
creating a funny scenario inspired by his poor daily street life. Zain’s
fabricated scenario from the series includes a dialogue between two
characters.
ZAIN (ADDRESSING YONAS)
Look.

FUNNY VOICE
"Hello honeybunny." "How are you, buddy?"

HEAVY VOICE
"How you doin’, bro?"

ZAIN (RAHIL GIGGLES)
I'll fill her mouth with shit if she keeps harassing you Shall I
open fire?

Rahil signals Zain to keep quiet.

ZAIN
What a piece of shit, that bitch... Slut, whore, filthy...

ZAIN (SHOUTS AT NEIGHBOR)

Rahil closes Zain’s mouth before he gets them in troubles with the crazy
neighbor. Both of them are giggling.

eyes.

Rahil is cying. She asks a bakery manager for money but he refuses.

CLASS BLDG. 132.

Rahil is waiting for somebody next to the garbage bin. A young concierge,
steps out of the building holding several garbage bags and a crumbled
envelope. While he pretends to throw out the garbage bags, he
approaches Rahil.

CONCIERGE
I can't do anything for you, Rahil. You're going to ruin
everything. Know what happens if they find out about us?
They'll deport both you and the boy. Please leave, I’m only a
doorman. They can replace me ina second.

RAHIL
Want to even see a picture of him?

CONCIERGE
No, I can't. I'm sorry, please go now.

133. INT.NIGHT-RAHIL’S HOME 133.
Zain and Rahil are at home having dinner. Zain sings a funny song about

hashish. Yonas, who’s sitting on Rahil’s knees, claps and babbles. Rahil
seems worried.
ZAIN (SINGING)
Yes, | am the King of Hashish...

Unable to fall sleep, Rahil, who is deeply thinking, lies in bed with Yonas
by her side.

134, EXT.DAY-NEIHBORHOOD 134.
Rahil walks through a narrow neighborhood, where laundry is hanging
outside, and a stray dog is looking at her.

135. INT. DAY- HAIR SALON 135.
Seen from behind, Rahil is sitting on a chair. We see the hairdresser
cutting her hair off with scissors at the level of the clips.. Rahil’s eyes fill
up with tears. The hairdresser weighs the hair. On her way out of the
salon, Rahil collects 300$ from the cashier.

What's the matter? Do I look different?

Rahil and Yonas giggle, while Zain is staring at the window, with tears in
his eyes.

138. INT.DAY-RAHIL’S HOME 138.
While lying in bed at Rahil’s house, Zain remembers a moment with his

sister Sahar. They are looking outside the window, laughing, and
chatting.
139. INT.NIGHT-RAHIL’S HOME 139.

Zain wipes his tears away. The laughs of Rahil and Yonas are heard in the
background.

140. INT.NIGHT-RAHIL’S HOME 140.

After staring in the void, Rahil goes to count the money she was hiding,
while making sure Zain doesn’t see her. She hides them again in the
same place.

141. INT.DAY-RAHIL’S HOME 141.

While listening to Ethiopian music in her bathroom, Rahil gets ready to
go. She brushes her hair and makes braids. In the other room, Zain makes
funny faces while eating and sitting at the table to entertain Yonas, who is
sitting in the inflatable pool. All dressed up, Rahil puts a scarf on, draws
her beauty mark on her cheek, and carries Yonas to kiss him goodbye. She
then put him back, so he starts sobbing.

ZAIN
Where are you going?

RAHIL

I'm going to call my mom, and then I need to go to Souk al
Ahad.

RAHIL (SPEAKING EHTIOPIAN WITH YONAS)
You're not alone, Zain is here. You can play with him.
Bye. (Yonas waves back)

RAHIL
Bye, Zain.

ZAIN
Bye.

After she leaves, Zain quickly gets up and goes to check inside the bar of
her bed. He doesn’t find the money, so he angrily goes back and sits on
the chair.
142. INT.DAY-INTERNET CAFE 142.
Ina cyber café where foreign workers meet up, we can hear a mix of
different languages loudly filling up the room. Rahil’s face is glowing from

the computer screen. She is wearing headphones and her eyes are filled
with tears.

RAHIL (CRYING, SPEAKING ETHIOPIAN)
I can't send you any money this month. Because I'm taking
English lessons, so I really can't. I'm so sorry, Mom. I can't ask
Madame for money. She's been so good to me, I'm ashamed to
ask. I love you so much, Mom.
143. INT.LATE AT NIGHT-RAHIL’S HOME 143.

Zain wakes up, takes a look around him, and is surprised to see that very
late and Rahil hasn’t come home yet. Yonas is sleeping next to him.

ZAIN (LOOKING AROUND)
Rahil? Rahil? Rahil?

He goes back to bed and covers Yonas with the blanket. He starts
thinking.
144. INT.DAY-RAHIL’S HOME 144.

Zain sits on the couch and angrily breaks a cassette.

145. INT.DAY-RAHIL’S HOME 145.

Zain wakes Yonas up and dresses him up.

146. EXT.DAY-STREET 146.

Yes, get in.
147. INT.DAY-BUS 147.

about her.

Haven't seen her since yesterday morning. I figured she's sick
or something.

ZAIN
She said she was going to Souk al Ahad, but hasn't come back.

EGYPTIAN EMPLOYEE (YONAS ON HIS LAP)
Maybe she went to Aspro?

ZAIN

ZAIN
Is that Aspro, Aspro?

153. EXT.DAY-IN FRONT OF ASPRO’S STAND 153.

Zain reaches the stand. He is seen talking to Aspro.

ASPRO (SURPRISED)
Rahil? How are you related to Rahil?

ZAIN
We're family.

ASPRO (SARCASTIC)
Family? Let's see. Obviously. On her mother's or father's side?

ASPRO (TALKING ABOUT YONAS)
Isn't this her son, Yonas? Right? What's Yonas doing with you?

ZAIN
Rahil left the house yesterday, and hasn't come back yet.

ASPRO
Give me Yonas, let me see him.

 

ZAIN
No, no...
ASPRO
You scared? I know everything about my little Yonas. He's a
badass, just like his mother. (Aspro takes Yonas and carries
him) Yasser! Two falafels for these two rabbits over here!

ASPRO (ADDRESSING YONAS)
You hungry?

ASPRO
You didn't try to call her?

ZAIN
I don't have a phone.

ASPRO (TRIES TO CALL RAHIL)
Her phone's off. Thank you, Yasser. (Zain looks more worried)

ASPRO
Come and eat inside.

ZAIN
No thank you.

ASPRO
What do | tell her if she comes by?

 

ZAIN (TAKES YONAS BACK)
That we were looking for her and went home.

ASPRO
Stay here.

ZAIN
No, no.

ASPRO

Wait for her here, in case she comes by.

Zain leaves without replying.

154. EXT. DAY- IN FRONT OF FLEA MARKET 154.

Holding Yonas and the falafel sandwiches, Zain leaves the flea market
and sits on the sidewalk in front of it. He puts Yonas down next to him.
While eating their sandwiches, Zain calls a girl and hands her his Pepsi
bottle.

ZAIN
Hey girl! Where can I open this? (Talking about the Pepsi
bottle)

MAYSOUN
Keep an eye on these. (She hands him her tissue boxes and
goes)

MAYSOUN (SHE COMES BACK)
Here you go.

ZAIN
Thank you.

MAYSOUN
You're welcome. (Sits next to Yonas, who stares at her)

ZAIN
Are you hungry?

MAYSOUN
No. Enjoy. What's your name?

ZAIN
Ibrahim.

MAYSOUN (TALKING ABOUT YONAS)
And this one?

ZAIN (CREATING A FAKE NAME)
He's... His name's Asaad. And you?

MAYSOUN
Maysoun.

MAYSOUN (ABOUT YONAS)
Did you steal him, or are you using him to beg?

ZAIN
He's my brother.

MAYSOUN
Doesn't look like you.

ZAIN
We were all born black like him, and then... we brightened up
with time. How much do you sell these boxes for?

MAYSOUN
It depends on the car. Let's say a woman passes... You look at
her hand, if she's wearing a ring, you say: "God bless and
protect you and your husband." If she's not wearing a ring, you
say: "May God send you a worthy husband."

ZAIN (TALKING TO YONAS)
Stop licking your hands! They're dirty from the floor.

Yonas lies in Zain’s arms, sarts babbling, and puts his hand inside his
shirt.

otherwise they would deport her. Her fake beauty mark totally
disappeared.

ETHIOPIAN WOMAN (SPEAKING ETHIOPIAN)
You can't tell them anything! They'll take the boy away from

Rahil lies down next to the other women. They are seen chatting, while
Rahil is silently crying. The cell is crammed with people.
162. INT. DAY DETENTION CELL BATHROOM 162.

Rahil bends over the bathroom sink and empties the milk from her

are heading home.

165. INT.DAWN-RAHIL’S HOME 165.

ZAIN
I'll take the one for 250.

168. EXT.DAY-NEIGHBORHOOD 168.

On his way back, Zain notices a three year old little girl sitting alone on
an old couch outside, sleeping, and holding a bottle of milk. A sound of
crying babies is heard in the background. Zain stares at her, and then we
see him walking away quickly, hiding the bottle of milk that he stole
from the child in his jacket, while the baby cries.
169. INT.DAY-RAHIL’S HOME 169.

Zain goes inside Rahil’s home holding the little girl’s bottle. Yonas is still
crying. Zain tries to give him the bottle, but he rejects it many times as he
is only used to his mother’s milk. The annoying neighbor is heard
shouting and cursing again.

ZAIN
Try it. Just this once.
Seriously...
Isn't this better than a shawarma sandwich?
Don't swallow it whole, you'll get sick!
Hey!
You swallowed it?

Sleepy Zain is watching TV through the window reflection, while Yonas
is lying on his laps and touching his face.

in tupperwares and cookers.

172. INT.DAY-RAHIL’S HOME 172.

In the inflatable pool, Yonas is sitting and eating dirt from the floor. Zain
opens the freezer, takes out an ice cube tray and empties it in a plate. He
sprinkles sugar on top of the ice cubes, and they eat them.

ZAIN
Seriously, isn't this better than a shawarma sandwich?
Don't swallow it whole, you'll get sick! Hey! You swallowed it?

173. EXT.DAY-AROUND THE HOUSE 173.

Zain is holding the measuring tape and talking to himself about Rahil,
while her son is sitting in the inflatable pool eating dirt from the carpet.

ZAIN
She doesn't care about her son? Is he all right? Is he sick? Your
mother is even worse than mine!
182. EXT.DAY-AROUND RAHIL’S HOME 182.
Exhausted, Zain is holding Yonas and walking around Rahil’s home. He
turns back to see the same little girl we previously saw sitting on a worn
out skateboard with her brother standing by her side.
183. EXT.DAY-AROUND RAHIL’S HOME 183.
Zain steals the skateboard from them. The boy starts screaming, so Zain

Zain enters Souk Al Ahad, still dragging the skateboard. He hears the
voice of Maysoun from behind, calling him, so he turns around. Maysoun
is trying to sell a funeral wreath at Souk Al Ahad.

MAYSOUN
Ibrahim! Ibrahim! Ibrahim! What are you doing here?

ZAIN
I'm selling pots.

MAYSOUN
Those crappy pots?

ZAIN
They're better than that flower thing on your back.

MAYSOUN
It's for cemeteries, idiot! Well, I can sell this in two seconds.
They'll buy the whole thing.

ZAIN
Want to bet?

MAYSOUN
Let's bet on a plate of food.

ZAIN
I want meat rolls and Shish Barak. What about you?

MAYSOUN
I want meat rolls and Shish Barak... My God... I'd be sitting and
eating, but not just any plate, a huge one...

ZAIN
From where do you bring the food aid? Didn’t you talk to me
about food aid last time?

MAYSOUN
You mean the food dispensary?

ZAIN
Can I go with you?
MAYSOUN
No, you're Lebanese, not a Syrian refugee like me.

MAN (WITH A HAT ON, TALKING ABOUT
YONAS)
Where did you get this bunny from?

ZAIN
Mind your own shit! Look at this stupid goat.

MAYSOUN
Let's go.

ZAIN (ANGRILY)
Can you fuck off? Wanna eat my fist?

MAYSOUN
Come Ibrahim, let’s go.
187. EXT.DAY-OUTSIDE FLEA MARKET 187.

Zain and Maysoun are sitting outside Souk Al Ahad, in a corner, with
Yonas still sitting in the basin.

MAYSOUN

You can keep this country all to yourself, I'm leaving.
ZAIN

Where to?
MAYSOUN

I'm leaving you the business and everything. It can be all yours.

ZAIN
Where are you going?

MAYSOUN
To Sweden. There's a neighborhood full of Syrians there. No
one asks what are you doing here. No one messes with you. I’ll
have my own room, no one comes in without knocking. I
choose who can come in and who can't. Kids there, they die
only from natural causes.

ZAIN
I want to go with you.

MAYSOUN
Sure, but you need money.

ZAIN
How much?

MAYSOUN
About $300, not more.

Yes, in Souk Al Ahad.

ZAIN
Yes, what about him?

MAYSOUN
This is his number.

MAYSOUN (SHOWS HIM A PIECE OF PAPER)
He organizes the trip. He gave me this piece of paper. I drew a
ship next to his number. The ship has the most beautiful
lights... and amazing food.

ZAIN
Can I take my brother Assaad with me?

MAYSOUN
Does he know how to swim?

ZAIN
I'll teach him.

MAYSOUN
I don't know, you'd have to ask Ospro.
ZAIN (MOCKING HER)
Aspro, not Ospro.

MAYSOUN
Aspro.

188. INT.DAY-RAHIL’S HOME 188.

Yonas is heard crying in the background, while Zain is standing in front
of the mirror, practicing the Syrian accent so he can get the food
dispensary that Maysoun was talking about. He holds a conversation
with himself as if they are talking to him, to train himself.

ZAIN (ASKING HIMSELF, LEBANESE ACCENT)
Where are you from?

ZAIN (CORRECTING SYRIAN ACCENT)
Where are you from?

ZAIN (SYRIAN ACCENT)

ZAIN (ASKING HIMSELF)

Zain is talking to a volunteer sitting on a desk. He is surrounded by
veiled women waiting for their turns. Yonas is lying on the desk in front
of him.

VOLUNTEER
So you were strolling by the river?

ZAIN (UNCERTAIN)
Yeah, I slipped and dropped my card. I jumped in the river, but
couldn't find it.

VOLUNTEER
And how did you get here?

ZAIN
We were at home in Syria, and our next door neighbor ratted
us out, maybe... | really shouldn't jump to conclusions but I
suspect it was him. A bomb hit our house... We started to crawl
like Rambo. You know, the one who crawls?
VOLUNTEER
You started crawling?

ZAIN
Yeah, like him, in the trenches.

VOLUNTEER
Okay, and what exactly do you want?

ZAIN
Whatever you have, but most important is milk and diapers.

VOLUNTEER
Milk and diapers?

ZAIN
And if you have any ramen, vinegar chips, stuff like that...
192. EXT.DAY-STREET 192.

Get up. What are you looking at? Get up!
193. EXT.DAY-SIDE OF THE STREET 193.

ASPRO (SARCASTIC)
Nice Lamborghini! Come here, let me see, kid. Rahil still hasn't
shown up?

ZAIN
No... | mean yeah, Rahil? She's been back for a while.

ASPRO (SARCASTIC)
Yeah, right. What are you dragging around? A nuclear bomb or
a rocket?

ZAIN
A brand new, top-of-the-line water tank.

ASPRO (SARCASTIC)
How much for this brand new, top-of-the-line water tank?

ZAIN
20,000.

ASPRO (SARCASTIC)
20,000? Yasser! Give me 30,000 for this 20,000 guy.

ASPRO (HOLDS YONAS’S HAND)
Yonas... Why's Yonas looking so thin? Aren't you guys eating?
He seems sick. My god, you both smell like dogs?

ASPRO (LOWERS HIS VOICE AND ADDRESSES
ZAIN)
I already talked to Rahil. There's a good family that can take
Yonas in, take care of him, dress him... And you could line your
pockets with $500. Deal? So? (Yonas innocently looks at them)

ZAIN
I heard you can help people travel to Turkey.

ASPRO
You want to travel?

 

ZAIN
I wish I could.
ASPRO
Where do you want to go?

ZAIN
To Turkey. I mean Sweden.

ASPRO
Sweden, Turkey, whichever you like.

ZAIN
Which one's prettier?

ASPRO
You choose. I'll even send you to the moon. All you have to do
is convince her about the boy. Deal, kiddo?

YASSER
Here you go, boss.

ASPRO (GIVES ZAIN THE MONEY)
Take this and tell Rahil that Aspro sends his regards. All right?

ZAIN
I'll ask Rahil.

Ask Rahil.

At the back of a gas station, Zain and Yonas use a hose from the carwash
to shower. He scrubs Yonas’s hair with a bar of soap. He rinses Yonas’s
hair from the cold water hose. Zain is washing his dirty laundry by
walking on top it. The worker adds soap on the laundry, and scrubs Zain’s
hair. Zain enjoys splashing water on his face. Zain laughs loudly. The
worker also scrubs Yonas’s hair, and then dries him with a towel. Zain
dresses Yonas up, then squeezes the wet clothes, while the same worker
distracts Yonas.
198. EXT.DAY-IN FRONT OF RAHIL’S HOME 198.
Zain stands on an old wooden chair and hangs the laundry in front of the
house. Yonas sits in the basin and helps him by handing him the

He blows in his hands to warm them up, so Yonas does the same.
ZAIN
Go like this to warm your hands.

Zain walks at the port. He fills two gallons with sea water.

204. EXT.DAY-RAHIL’S NEIGHBORHOOD 204.

Out of breath, Zain is heading home with difficulty. He is dragging two
gallons of water.

205. INT.DAY-RAHIL’S HOME 205.

On an old newspaper, Zain is crushing the TRAMAL pills, like he used to
do before at his house. Yonas is sitting on the ground. He grabs a pill to
eat it, but Zain shouts at him and put him back in the inflatable pool.

ZAIN
No!

Zain crushes the pills, but Yonas curiously comes closer to see what Zain
is doing.
ZAIN
Go away! Don't think I can't see you, I'm not blind!

Zain empties the TRAMAL powder into a pot full of water. He stirs them
with a big wooden spoon. Yonas’s leg is tied with a rope to the bed.
Yonas cries and Zain fills the juice in water bottles.

206. EXT.EVENING-STREET 206.

Zain is holding the basin with Yonas inside it, surrounded by a water
bottle and coffee cups. He meets teenagers hanging out in front of a
garage.
ZAIN (CALLS THEM)
Hey guys! Can one of you give me a hand?

A guy comes and bends down to help him, so Zain whispers to him.

ZAIN (WHISPERING)
I have Tramadol shots. You interested? 1,000 a shot.

The teenager goes back to his friends to ask them and leave Zain waiting
a bit.

ZAIN
Hey, help me lift it. Come and help! Brother, for you I can make
a deal.

THE TEENAGER

Come on, hurry up.

207. EXT.NIGHT-STREET 207.

Zain goes to a different group of teenagers. They are all smoking
cigarettes and look wasted.

TEENAGER
Guys, he has Tramadol.

ZAIN
I got Tramadol by the shot, interested?

ANOTHER TEENAGER
Have any Viagra? Or Rivo?

ANOTHER TEENAGER
Got any Rivo?

ANOTHER TEENAGER
Farawla? Tradamol?

ANOTHER TEENAGER
Free base?

ZAIN
I'm in the juice business.
ZAIN (SHOWS THEM THE TRAMAL BOTTLE)
This is like Rivo, but juice-style.

Yonas is still sitting in the basin holding a coffee cup and babbling. A
second tramal and water bottle is by his side. Zain shakes the bottle.

TEENAGER (AFTER TASTING IT)
You're selling me saltwater, big man?

ZAIN (JOKINGLY)
What's better than seawater, man?

208. EXT.DAY-STREET 208.
Zain stops by three old men on the street.

ZAIN
I've got Tramadol by the sip, interested?

After tasting it, one of the men spits it.

209. EXT.DAY-STREET 209.
Different shots of Zain selling Tramal shots to several people. Yonas is
still with him in the basin. Zain hands them the coffee cups as shots.

210. EXT.NIGHT-STREET 210.

ZAIN
1,000 a shot.

211. INT.DAY-RAHIL’S HOME 211.
Zain counts his money and hides it in the metal bar of the bed like Rahil

used to do.

212. INT.DAY-RAHIL’S HOME 212.
Zain and Yonas are lying in bed next to each other, looking at the paper
that Maysoun gave him and smiling.

ZAIN
Here, choose. Which country do you want to go to?
Let's go to Sweden! It's the prettiest. We'll go with that idiot
Maysoun.

213. INT.DAY-RAHIL’S HOME 213.

Zain is sitting on the ground, smoking a cigarette and talking to himself.
Yonas is moving around the house and babbling.

ZAIN
When you're In Sweden, there are no assholes who get in your

face. You can even piss from the balcony, no one will give you
shit for it.

214, EXT.NIGHT-STREET 214,
In the basin, Yonas puts the cup on his mouth. Teenagers give Zain looks.
He stares back and keeps walking. One of the teenagers in a group takes

the tramal bottle from him and hides it, so another guy hits him and
gives it back to Zain.

GUY
Give him the money, bitch! Take your midget and leave!

ZAIN
I'm leaving, chill.
215. EXT.NIGHT-STREET 215.

ZAIN (SHOUTS AT SOME GUY)
Shove it up your ass and cook it!

216. EXT.NIGHT-STREET 216.

A teenager we previously saw is blowing cigarette smoke in Zain’s face.
217. EXT.NIGHT-STREET 217.
Teenagers are standing around Yonas. One of them kicks his basin.

ZAIN (ANGRILY THROWS A STONE AT HIM)
Don't go near the kid, asshole!

TEENAGER (HITS ZAIN)
Fuck off, you little prick! Fuck off before I trash your face! Get
the fuck out of here!

Zain leaves with Yonas. His eyes are red and filled with tears.

218. EXT.DAY-NARROW STREET 218.

Zain is walking through the narrow poor streets and dragging Yonas
behind him.

219. EXT.DAY-TOP VIEW NEIGHBORHOOD 219.

Top shot of the poor neighborhood. We see plenty of tires on the roofs of
all the worn out buildings.

220. EXT.DAY-AROUND RAHIL’S HOME 220.

Zain is dragging Yonas behind him, who is babbling, clapping the two
coffee cups, and surrounded by empty water bottles in the basin.
Suddenly Zain gets flustered when he sees Yonas’s belongings thrown in
front of Rahil’s home. When he gets to the door, he notices a padlock and
tries to break in. He gets angry and starts kicking the door with no
success of breaking it down. He grabs a rock and tries to break the lock.
Alarmed, the neighbor comes and starts shouting at him while holding
her baby.

NEIGHBOR (SHOUTING)
Why are you breaking the door down?

ZAIN
What sonofabitch changed the lock and threw my shit out?

NEIGHBOR
What shit? It's all here! And who the hell are you?
ZAIN
I still have stuff inside.

NEIGHBOR
What stuff? Maybe the landlord has it.

ZAIN
Where does the shitlord live?

NEIGHBOR
Why don't you find your dirty slut? Keep bashing that door and
I'll call the warden.

ZAIN (WITH SARCASM)
Go ahead, tell him I said, "Hi."

NEIGHBOR
What's your relation to that bitch again?

ZAIN (HOLDS A PIECE OF WOOD)
I'm her brother.

NEIGHBOR
Which gutter did she drag you out of?

ZAIN (TRIES TO BREAK THE LOCK)
Get out of my face before I lose it!

NEIGHBOR
I'm calling the warden now! You'll see.

ZAIN (RUNS TO HER HOUSE AND STARTS
BREAKING THINGS)
I'll break your house down! Where's the fucking landlord?

NEIGHBOR
Get out of here before I break your skull!

ZAIN (COMES BACK AND TRIES TO BREAK THE
LOCK AGAIN)
Shut up! Shut your mouth!

 

NEIGHBOR
Get out of here!
ZAIN (WHILE TRYING TO BREAK IN)
I. Want. My. Fucking. Money!

221. EXT.DAY-STREETS 221.

Shots of the busy streets packed with honking cars.

222. EXT.DAY-STREET 222.

Under the hot sun, Zain and Yonas are sitting in the street next to a stand
that sells second-hand, old shoes. Their clothes, hands, and faces are
very dirty. Zain looks disappointed. Yonas is loudly crying, so Zain holds
him to calm him down. Zain’s eyes are red from fatigue, hunger, and lack
of sleep. He gets up and puts Yonas down, then empties the plastic bag in
the basin. Yonas innocently looks at him.

ZAIN
Stay here, don't move.

Zain quietly leaves and disappears at the corner of the street. He takes a
few steps and then looks back. Yonas is behind him following him with
baby steps with an innocent look.

ZAIN
Go back there! Go over there.

Yonas is moving around, smiling at Zain, and waving at him. Zain comes
back and tries to sit Yonas down so he doesn’t move.

ZAIN
There... There!

Zain turns his back and walks away. He turns around to see Yonas
running towards the cars, so he quickly follows him and catches his
hand. We hear the cars honking loudly.

ZAIN
Go over there.

Yonas falls down. Zain feels bad for him, so he picks him up and grabs his
hand. He drags him down and ties his leg with a rope to the wall. Zain
walks away again while holding his plastic bag and taking a glimpse at
Yonas. Yonas tries to move but he can’t. Zain sits on the sidewalk across
the street and looks at Yonas with a miserable look in his eyes. He sees
him sobbing. He wipes his tears, gets up, quickly comes closer to him,
unties his leg, and opens a bag of chips for him to eat.

223. INT.DAY-BUS 223.

Zain is sitting in the bus, with Yonas on his laps. Zain looks at Yonas. He
seems helpless. Yonas innocently caresses Zain’s face.

224, EXT.DAY-FLEA MARKET 224.

Zain is heading towards Aspro’s kiosk, and dragging Yonas behind him.
Zain looks defeated, depressed and exhausted. His eyes are filled with
tears.

225. EXT.DAY-SUNDAY FLEA MARKET 225.

From afar, we see Zain speaking to Aspro. Zain cries and wipes his tears.
Aspro touches his dirty hair.

ASPRO (TALKING ON PHONE)
Yes, my friend. Listen... I'm sending you a little kid. Looks like a
dog, we need to make him look human. Can you do that? I have
to get him out of the country. Ok.

ASPRO (TALKING TO ZAIN)
Why the sad face?

ZAIN
Nothing.

ASPRO
We agreed on this. Do you have papers? Any ID, a birth
certificate?

ZAIN
I don't know, maybe at home.

 

ASPRO
I need proof you're a human being. ID card, registration, even a
newspaper with your picture, anything... So I can get you out
through the port of Beirut, ok? Can you do that? (Zain nods)

ASPRO
Don't worry about Yonas. I love him. I'll put him with a good
family.

ASPRO

The people you're traveling with will take good care of you.
Remember Yasser who works for me? Go see him. He'll send
you to a barber. Then you go home and bring back what? Your
papers.

ZAIN
My papers.

ASPRO (COUNTS THE MONEY)
Got it? Here... One, two, three, four. Take it.

ZAIN
You promised me $500.

ASPRO (HITS ZAIN, THEN WHISPERS)
You expect to eat and drink for free? $100 pays for your food,
got it? Give me a kiss. Take care of yourself, ok? Go on.

Aspro picks Yonas up from the basin and puts him on his desk. Zain gets
close to him, hugs him and kisses him.

ASPRO
That's enough, you should go. I told you I'll take good care of
him, ok?
Zain looks at him one last time, then walks away into an alley within the

market dragging the empty basin/skateboard behind him. Yonas is sitting
on Aspro’s desk. With a naive look, he watches Zain walking away.

226. INT.DAY-PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION BUS 226.
Sitting in the bus, Zain is sadly looking at Yonas’s pacifier. His nails are

filled with dirt.

227. INT.DAY-BARBER 227.
The hairdresser is cutting is Zain’s hair, while he is looking at himself in
the mirror and wiping his tears.

228. EXT.DAY-PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION BUS 228.

Zain gets off the bus. He throws away the basin in the garbage as if he is
getting rid ofa chapter in his life, and keeps his plastic bag.

229, EXT.DAY-STREET 229.

Zain walks down the street and heads home.

230. INT.DAY-STAIRS OF ZAIN’S BUILDING 230.

Zain goes up the stairs of his building and with a new eye rediscovering
the misery he left behind- a dripping sewerage pipe, moldy walls, two
kids alone on the stairs. At the doorway of his old apartment, he finds the
door half open. He slowly pushes it in and enters.

231. INT.DAY-ZAIN’S APPARTMENT 231.

The apartment is calm. Zain’s father is sleeping on the couch, a half
smoked cigarette in the ashtray on the table where lies a half cut apple, a
pack of cigarettes, a lighter, bread, a plate, and a whiskey glass. Zain turns
off the cigarette then stares at his sleeping father.

Zain heads to the bedroom, opens the drawer, and looks for his papers.
Zain is still searching in the drawers, when he hears his sisters’ voices, a
baby crying and his mother’s voice from behind. Zain turns around and
sees his mother dressed in black.

ZAIN’S SISTER
Zain!

SOUAD (SURPRISED)
When did you come back?

ZAIN
None of your business.

SOUAD (HITS AND SHOUTS AT HIM)
Where the hell have you been? Where have you been all this
time? Where? Where? Where? Damn you!

ZAIN
Anyway I'm not here to see you or that asshole over there. I
need my papers.

SOUAD (WITH SARCASM)
Oh! Of course, my sweetheart! Selim, wake up, your son needs
his papers!

Salim wakes up.

ZAIN
Where are my papers?

SELIM
Where the hell have you been?

ZAIN
None of your business, just give me my papers.

SELIM
None of my business? What do you need papers for? Want to

become a trash collector?

ZAIN
My papers, my ID, anything!

SELIM
Who gives a shit about you or me or any of us?

Zain angrily throws something on the ground.

SELIM (KICKS THE TABLE)
Don't play the big man with me, you little shit!

 

SELIM (STANDS UP AND DRAGS ZAIN)
Come take your papers? Come! I've got a lot of papers. (He
opens a small box and takes the papers out). Which ones do
you want? (Selim sits on a chair). I've got papers that can send
me to jail. I've got an eviction notice... (Souad is carefully
looking at them) And here's the most important paper of all.
(Zain, annoyed, walks away) Come back here, you should see
this one! (Selim grabs his arm) This one's from a hospital. It
could break any man's heart. We're insects, my friend. Don't
you get it? We're parasites. You either accept life without
papers, or you might as well jump out the window. Got it? Get
the hell out of here before I kill you! (Selim kicks him out of the
room)

SOUAD
Stop Selim!

SELIM (SHOUTS AND DRAGS ZAIN)
Tell whoever the hell sent you: "My father never gave a shit! He
never got us any papers.” Go back where you came from, you
animal! Damn you and your mother and whoever brought you
to this world.

ZAIN
Who went to the hospital?

SOUAD
Not a word, Selim. Don't say another word!

ZAIN (ASKS HIS SISTERS)
Who went to the hospital? Who went to the hospital? Who's in
the hospital? (Everyone keeps quiet)

SELIM (SHOUTING)
Get him out of my sight before I tear him to pieces! I curse your
father's seed!

ZAIN (CRYING)
Who went to the hospital?

ZAIN (GRABS HIS MOTHER’S ARM)
Who went to the hospital?

SELIM (CSTARTS CRYING)
Little shit!

ZAIN (TO HIS MOTHER)
Tell me!

ZAIN
Who went to the hospital?

 

ZAIN (WIPES HIS TEARS)
What did that motherfucker do to her?
ZAIN (HITS HIS FATHER)
What did he do to her? What did he do to her?

SELIM (LOOKING DEFEATED)
Sahar is gone, it's over.

ZAIN (GOES TO THE ROOM AND GRABS A KNIFE
FROM THE DRAWER)
She's gone? She’s gone? I'll show you who's gone.

ZAIN (RUNS AWAY WITH THE KNIFE)
I'll show you who's who, who'll be gone...

SOUAD (SCREAMS)
He's got a knife!

232. INT.DAY- BUILDING STAIRWAY 232.

Zain goes down the stairs four steps at a time full of rage. His parents are
following him.

SELIM
I'll bury you alive! Come back, you son of a bitch! I'll kill you
with my bare hands!

233. EXT.DAY-STREET 233.
Determined Zain runs towards Assad’s market holding the knife steady in
his hand. His father, followed by his mother, is running after him. Zain
reaches the market. We see several people, most of them little kids,
standing in shock and staring.

234, INT.DAY-POLICE STATION 234.

A police officer takes handcuffed Zain inside the office. We can see blood
stains on Zain’s face and hands.

POLICE OFFICER
Uncuff him.
He is standing, his face is towards the wall, and his hands are on the wall.
Zain is taking off his clothes. An officer checks his mouth and teeh to
determine his age.

235. INT.DAY-DETENTION CENTER FOR UNDOCUMENTED PEOPLE 235.
(One of the first scenes of the movie but taken through another angle,
through a window this time) Zain is standing in his underwear. The
forensic doctor that we saw at the beginning of the movie is checking
Zain’s mouth.

236. INT.DAY-DETENTION CORRIDOR 236.

Different drawers where we see files classified by nationality.

237. INT.DAY-IMMIGRANT DETENTION CELLS 237.
Different prison cells with the foreign prisoners grouped according to
nationality. Their faces are expressionless and looking half dead. We see
several ventilators in the hallway. Plastic water bottles are stuck between
the bars.

238. INT.DAY- DETENTION CELL 238.

Seen from behind, a guard opens the prison cell and let Zain go inside.

BACK TO COURT

239. INT.DAY-COURTROOM 239.
Abou Assad is pushing his son Assad’s wheelchair in front of the judge.
THE JUDGE
You are the husband of...? What was her name again?

ASSAD
Sahar.
THE JUDGE
Sahar. How old was Sahar when you married her?

ASSAD
Eleven.

THE JUDGE
11 years old. Do you think an 11-year-old girl is suitable for
marriage? Does she know what it means?

ASSAD
From what | know... Yes, she is... She blossomed, she reached
that time...

ZAIN (ANGRILY)
Really? I didn’t know she was a potato or a tomato plant that
blossoms!

THE JUDGE
Zain, calm down!

ZAIN (ANGILY)
I didn't know she could die from it. Many girls in the
neighborhood get married at that age. Even my mother in law
was married at that age... And here she is, alive and well.

THE JUDGE
How long were you married before she got pregnant?

ASSAD
Two or three months.

THE JUDGE
Ok, was the pregnancy normal?

ASSAD
At first I didn't notice anything wrong. But then she started
bleeding. She bled a lot.

THE JUDGE
Then what happened?

ASSAD
I took her to the hospital with her parents. And she died at the
hospital door. The hospital wouldn't let her in.
NADINE
Can I ask why the hospital refused to admit her?

SOUAD (STARTS TO CRY)
Because she doesn't have any papers.

THE JUDGE
Counselor, I think that’s enough.

SOUAD (CRYING)
I live and work like a dog for you to stand here and judge me?
How dare you judge me? Have you ever been in my shoes?
Lived my life? You never have, and you never will! Not in your
worst nightmare. If you did, you'd hang yourself! Imagine
having to feed your kids water and sugar because you have
nothing else to give them. I'm ready to commit 100 crimes to
keep my children alive! They're mine, the treasures of my life!
No one has the right to judge me, I am my own judge. They're
my own flesh and blood. Do you understand?

Selim wipes his tears.

240. INT.DAY- DETENTION CENTER HALLWAY 240.

 

A shot of the prison hallway is showing a man walking around.

241. INT.DAY- DETENTION CENTER ROOM 241,

Two prison workers are pouring food from a large basin.

242. INT.DAY-POLICE OFFICE IN DETENTION CENTER 242.

 

A bunch of prisoners are lined up. Three officers are standing in an
office; one of them is holding a paper and reading names out loud. We
hear through the speaker an officer calling prisoners’ names out.

OFFICER (HEARD FROM THE SPEAKER)
The Syrian, Hussein... The Egyptian, Mohammad...

243. INT.DAY- DETENTION CELL 243.
A shot of male’s prison cell, they are lying down waiting.

244, INT.DAY- DETENTION CENTER HALLWAY 244.

A foreign woman is dancing and smiling. A convoy of musicians are
playing guitar for free. They are guided by a nun and pass through the
prison hallway singing. Speechless Zain is sitting in his cell, looking
outside, and eating an apple.

THE NUN
Excuse me, can you lend us an ear? The priest and I came here
to meet you and get to know you a little bit. And maybe cheer
you up a little bit. Come on, let’s sing a song.

The convoy continues to a neighboring cell where several women from
different nationalities are over packed together (Sri Lankan, Ethiopian,
etc.) we see Rahil. She is sitting in a corner deep in thought. Her face is
bruised. She is insensitive to the musical show, which is amusing some of
the other girls.

The convoy stops in front of different prison cells to entertain the foreign
detainees crammed inside the cells together. Zain is speechless at the
absurd spectacle.

245. INT.DAY- MALES’ DETENTION CELL 245

 

A group of male prisoners are praying together. Zain is sitting and
staring at them indifferently.

246. INT.DAY- FEMALES’ DETENTION CELL 246.

Zain is lying down on the mattress staring in the void, with a sad look in
his eyes.

250. INT.DAY- FEMALES’ DETENTION CELL 250.

A shot of a Sri Lankan woman eating a sandwich. From the speakers, we
hear an officer calling Zain.

OFFICER
Zain Al Hajj, gather your things, prepare for transfer.

Rahil, confused, hears Zain’s name on the speaker.

251. INT.DAY-PRISON HALLWAY 251.

An officer is taking Zain out of his cell. Rahil quickly gets up and stands
behind the bar to check whether it is Zain. Handcuffed Zain is following
the officer when he passes in front of Rahil’s cell, she looks at him in
despair.

RAHIL
Zain? Zain? Zain ? Zain! Zain! What are you doing here? Zain,
where's Yonas? Zain! Zain, where's Yonas? Zain! Where's my
son? Where's Yonas? Where! Who did you leave him with? My
son is alone at home.

Several other prisoners inside Rahil’s cell are shocked. Zain looks back.
Rahil frantically starts screaming more and more, rattling the bars. Her
prison-mates try to calm her. She fumbles over her words while she tries
to catch her breath. She starts speaking to herself.

252. INT.DAY-PRISON OFFICE 252.
Zain and Rahil are sitting in front of an officer’s desk.

ZAIN (DESCRIBING ASPRO’S EYE COLOR)
This eye... Here... is blue, blue, blue.

OFFICER (CONFUSED)
Both his eyes are blue?

ZAIN
No. This eye is brown, and this eye is blue.

253. INT.DAY-ROUMIEH PRISON FOR JUVENILES 253.

Behind the bars, Zain is looking outside with a miserable look on his face.

260. INT.DAY-PRISON CAFETERIA 260.

Ina colorful dress, Souad is smoking a cigarette. Zain sees her from the
cafeteria entrance and stares at her. She gets up and kisses him. They sit
down to talk.

SOUAD
How are you? Do you have a cold? Are you sick?

ZAIN (WITH DISGUST)
Congratulations, you're no longer in mourning? You're not
wearing black anymore?

SOUAD
I brought you some candy to nibble on. Eat them, Zain. Why are
you so angry with me? There was nothing I could have done.
She was my daughter, I lost her too.

ZAIN
What did you come here for?

SOUAD
When God takes something away from you, He blesses you in
return.

ZAIN
What did God bless you with?

SOUAD
I'm pregnant. You're going to have a little brother or sister.
ZAIN (DISGUSTED)
My heart aches.

SOUAD
I hope it's a girl. We'll name her Sahar.

ZAIN
Your words are stabbing me in the heart.

SOUAD
God willing, when you get out, she'll be walking and playing...

ZAIN
I don't want to see your face in here again. You have no heart.

Zain takes the bags and throws them in the garbage with anger in front of
his mother.

ZAIN (TO THE GUARD, WHILE LEAVING THE
VISITOR AREA)
Let go of me! I want to go outside!

You're live on the air. What do you want to say?
272. EXT.DAY-PRISON 272.

We still hear Zain’s voice but we see Zain walking with a guard and
heading towards the prison’s visitor area.

ZAIN
I want grown-ups to hear what I have to say. I’m sick of those
who can't take care of their kids. What will I take from all this?
All the insults, all the beatings, all the kickings? The chain, the
hose, or the belt? The nicest word I hear is: Fuck off, you
sonofabitch!" “Piss off, you fucker!"

273. INT.DAY- PRISON’S VISITOR AREA 273.

Zain comes up to her. Nadine stands up and extends her hand out to greet
him. We still hear his speech from the phone call.

ZAIN (ON PHONE WITH TV PRESENTER)
Life is dog shit. Filthier than the shoes on my feet! I'm living in
hell. Getting roasted, like the chicken I'm dying to eat.

NADINE (WITH A SMILE)
Howare you?

274, INT.DAY-TRANSPORTATION VAN FOR PRISONERS 274.

We still hear his speech. But we see him leaving a transportation van for
prisoners. He is handcuffed and escorted by an officer.

ZAIN
Life is a bitch! I was expecting to be a good man, respected and
loved. But God doesn't want that.

275. INT.DAY-COURTHOUSE HALLWAY 275.

Zain is walking down the hallway heading to the court that we
previously saw many times. We hear his voice in the background from
the phone call.

ZAIN
He wants us to be floor mats, to be stepped on.
276. INT.DAY-COURTROOM 276.

With a miserable look on his face, tired looking eyes, Zain addresses his
mother.

ZAIN
That kid in your belly will be just like me.

Souad silently looks at him and doesn’t say a word. She bends her head
down.

THE JUDGE
What do you want from your parents?

ZAIN
I want them to stop having children.

THE JUDGE
Speak up!

ZAIN (SPEAKS LOUDER)
I want them to stop having children!

THE JUDGE

You want them to stop having children?
ZAIN

That's right.
THE JUDGE

I don't think they're going to have any more children.

 

ZAIN
And what about that one? He's going to be born, no?

The judge and his parents silently look at him and don’t say a word.

277. INT.DAY-COURTHOUSE FILES ROOM 277.

The clerk goes into an archive room and puts a file between a pile of files.
The room is filled with columns of files.
278. INT.NIGHT-WAREHOUSE 278.
A group of police officers raid a dark warehouse.

OFFICER (SPEAKING ON THE PHONE WITH TV
PRESENTER)
We raided a warehouse where people were trapped...

279. INT.NIGHT-ASPRO’S HOUSE 279.

The police officers raid Aspro’s house. He is sitting with a group of other
people smoking cigarettes. He looks shocked.

280. INT.NIGHT-WAREHOUSE 280.

A police officer is holding Aspro and pushing him on the wall. Another
person is also standing by his side and held by the officers.

The officers are looking through the openings while holding flashlights
and searching for the trapped people.

They break in and find people from different nationalities in miserable
conditions sitting in the dark.

They also find Yonas, crying loudly. One of the police officers gets in and
picks him up.

281. INT.DAY- BEIRUT AIRPORT 281.
Rahil and several other colored women are waiting at the airport
surrounded by officers. Rahil is looking left and right. Suddenly she
notices a social worker heading her way with Yonas in her arms, both of
them smiling. Rahil runs like crazy towards her son. She grabs him into
her arms. She covers him with kisses and tears of happiness.

282. INT.DAY-PRISON HALLWAY 282.

Walking down the empty hallway, Zain is escorted by a guard and

handcuffed behind his back.

283. INT.DAY-IN FRONT OF A GRAY WALL 283.
Zain is standing still. Off camera, he is looking into a camera lens with a
neutral expression.

VOICE OF MAN
Stand on the line, Zain. Go a bit to the right. No, to the left. Too
much, back to the right.

Zain follows the instructions of the photographer.

ZAIN
No, this is my right. This is my left.

VOICE OF MAN
Tilt your head up a bit. Look straight ahead. Smile.

Zain doesn’t smile. He looks sad.
VOICE OF MAN
Smile, Zain.

This is for you ID card, not your death certificate.

Zain finally shows a little smile on his face.

THE END.
