EXT. HOUSE - NORTHERN CALIFORNIA - EVENING Al

Weathered wood, brightly-painted shutters, bicycles, a
trampoline. A driveway and garage.

Out front a pet barnyard, three chickens, a pair of
rabbits.

INT. STAIR LANDING 1

A stairway too formal for this house; light catching the
burnished steps. A man comes into view. In his late
thirties, bulky, muscular; a dynamic, almost compulsive
face, a specially sharp edge now to the rough features.

His name is GEORGE.
ON GEORGE

Soundlessly moving down the stairway into the hall. He
wears evening trousers, dress shirt, an untied black tie.

STUDY ~ DOWNSTAIRS 2

Books line the walls: a desk, a corkboard, autographed
pictures of sports figures; a hot plate and teapot, a
cedar file and a good chair.

Goerge stares at the desk, then sits. He looks into space
for a moment, his head nods into his hands. George sud-
denly looks up, blinks: his eyes brim with tears; he
sobs.. HOLD on George.

UPSTAIRS - BEDROOM 3
A woman sits before a mirror, ~

FAITH, young for her early thirties: woman, child and
mother in one and in conflict; but the best of each,
puckish, feisty, a natural unworked-for beauty. PULL BACK
from Faith to reveal her four children looking at her in
the mirror.

MOLLY, 7; MARIANNE, 10; JILL, 12; SHERRY, 13. Sherry dis-
tanced from the rest; at the brink of womanhood, a school
skirt, a scarf falling around her young breasts.

The girls lean towards their mother, intent on her dressing-
up preparations.

GEORGE
... it won't be easy, in the middle
of all those people and all I'1l
be doi: is thinking about you.
Rafter a@ moment)
Maybe I'll win, that would help.

A VOICE comes back through the phone; clean, seductive,
soothing. Her name is SANDY.

SANDY (V.0.)
You'll win, you're a winner.

CUT TO:

5 FAITH'S BEDROOM

Molly, Faith's youngest child, is mimicking her mother,
smearing her lips with lipstick; contortions of the mouth.

GEORGE
But even if I win, I lose, if you
know what I mean? .

SANDY (V.0.)
Forget us tonight, just try to have
a good time.

GEORGE
it's been so long since I've had
a good time, I wonder if I still

know how...

MOLLY JILL
Yeah! Yeah! No no, me first --

MOLLY
Aw, c'm'on, Mom, just a little --

Faith swivels towards Molly.

FAITH
Open wide.

Molly parts her lips.

FAITH
Not your mouth, darling, your eyes.

Molly rolls her eyes.upwards. The girls squeeze close,

everyone arching their eyebrows, fluttering their eye-
lashes.

Except Sherry, who drifts towards the hallway.
CUT TO:
TELEPHONE TABLE - STAIR LANDING 8

Sherry picks up the extension, but holds the cradle down,
now carefully lifts her finger,

MOVE IN on Sherry's face.

SANDY (V.0.)
. Where are you anyway?

GEORGE (V.0.)
Home.

SANDY (V.0.)
Home! I thought you'd stopped for
gas. I thought you were at the

Texaco. Get off the phone, for
God's sake --

CUT TO:
BEDROOM - ON MOLLY 9

Her eyes beautifully outlined now like a pre-Raphaelite
painting. Faith beams at her handiwork.

UPSTAIRS - BEDROOM 9A
Faith now applying a touch of eyeliner, the children

opening their eyes wide in support, Faith checks the
eyeliner in the mirror.

She sighs.

FAITH
I hate it.

JILL
I love it.

Molly, entranced with her mother's pencil, steals it to
try some eyeliner for herself. Faith, who has been busy
with fingertip to eye, now reaches for the pencil, but it
is not there. She slaps the boudoir tabletop in search
of it, spies Molly.

FAITH
Hey, Moll, give us a break.

Jill snatches the pencil away from Molly, hands it over
to her mother. Molly's face instantly a pudding of de-
spair. Faith notices.

FAITH
(to Molly)
Come here, let me show you.

MOLLY
(at the mirror)
How do I look?

JILL
Like a hooker.

MOLLY
So do you!
(grabbing Faith)
Do I look like a hooker?

FAITH
No, you look beautiful, you don't
look anything like a hooker.

MOLLY
(to Jill)
See, I don't look anything like a
hooker!

Faith laughs, hugs Molly.
MOLLY
(to Faith)
What's a hooker?

George coming up, Sherry going down. They meet.

SHERRY
You're off the phone?

George pauses.

GEORGE
What?

SHERRY
I asked you if you were off the
phone.

GEORGE
I was just talking to Jim.

George continues up the stairs.

SHERRY
Jim, huh? Is that why you whispered?

George turns around.
—~ GEORGE
Yeah, that's why I whispered.

But Sherry hasn't heard his reply, she has already turned
to go downstairs.

SHERRY
(calling up to George)
You better hurry! Mom looks terrific!

You seem surprised.
Pause.
GEORGE
Oh, forget it.
Silence.
FAITH
Is the dress okay?
GEORGE
Oh, yeah.
(squints at Faith's
dress)
It's the one you wore last year,
isn't it?
FAITH
Why, does it still have wine on it?
GEORGE
Wine?
FAITH

The wine you spilled when Peter
Atchison won instead of you.

GEORGE
You always remember the wrong things,

George exits. Sherry returns, easing into the room, picking
at a container of yogurt with a spoon.

FAITH
(to Sherry)
I look all right?

SHERRY
You look fabulous, Mom,

Sherry offers her mother a spoonful of yogurt. But Faith,
still at the mirror, ignores her, she is shaking her head.

Faith is re-examining her dress.
(CONTINUED)
11 CONTINUED: (2) 11
Ps FAITH
It needs a thing to gather it up
at the waist.
JILL
No, Mom, leave it like that, all
smooth,
FAITH
I need a thing. Where's the silk
rope that goes with my linen dress
-- I saw it somewhere?
MARIANNE
Between the big trees.
FAITH
(incredulous)
Where?
MARIANNE
The dryer broke when it was Molly's
turn to do the laundry. She used
it to hang out the wash.
~~ Faith sighs. She catches a glimpse of Sherry in the cor-

ner of the mirror, Sherry is wearing a hide-and-fringe
Davy Crockett belt.

Faith zeroes in on the belt; instantly Sherry and Faith
get the same idea.

FAITH
What do you think?

SHERRY
(taking off her belt)

Try it.

JILL
Now don't go wearing Sherry's old
belt, Mom --

Sherry ignores her, helping Faith do the belt around her
waist.

Now everyone checks Faith in the mirror.

SHERRY
It looks great.

MARIANNE
Real great, Mom.
MOLLY
Pret-tee.

Faith does look charming, Sherry's scarf a touch which
lifts her to the edge of beauty; Faith's smile takes her
the rest of the way.

FAITH
... Now everybody, get ready for
bed -- Molly, you go to bed --

MOLLY
Oh, come on, Mom -- you promised --

FAITH
I did not -- the show doesn't go
on 'til 11:30 -- you've got school --

MOLLY
You promised. You promised! I had
to go to bed last year.

Molly starts to cry.

JILL
You didn't promise. Make her go to
bed, Mom -- she'll drive us crazy.

Molly is desperate, inconsolable. Faith leans over Molly.
Faith smiles, shakes her head.

FAITH
All ripht. you can stay up -- you
can all stay up --

Molly hugs her mother with one hand, gives Jill the finger
with the other. Jill stomps out, furious.

Sherry wraps Faith's jacket around her mother, pulls her
head close, whispers to Faith.

SHERRY
That was her on the phone with him.

The SOUNDS in the b.g, of the jabbering children suddenly
drop out. Faith and Sherry exchange a deep look. The

SOUNDS suddenly return now, and Faith instantly comes
back to life.

FAITH

(out the door)
Good, they're coming out! Jill,
find your ballet slippers -- you've
got class tomorrow! Molly, if
you're going to stay up, clean out
your closet! Throw all that horrible
underwear in the wash and, Sherry, if
the plumber calls, tell him there's a
leak in the washing machine!

Faith hurries out as the children run to catch up with her.
EXT. HOUSE - GEORGE'S CAR 12

George at the wheel, Jill reaching through the window to
kiss her father.

JILL
(tousling George's head)
I love your haircut.

GEORGE
Thanks.

JILL
Your bow tie's too skinny.

GEORGE
No, it's not. It belonged to Grandpa.

JILL
(yanking)
It's a real one ~- it's not a clip-on.

GEORGE
Yeah, I tied it myself.

Faith appears, she hurries towards the car, opens the pas-
senger side. Jill and Molly are hanging on the car on the
driver's side. George rolls down the window to kiss them.
Upstairs, Sherry pensively watches the car drive off.

Faith, are you with me?

It's your night, George.

George jumps out, runs around to help Faith out, takes
her arm as PHOTOGRAPHERS move in. He Plunges forward,
protecting Faith through the melee, right past the Photog-
raphers who, not recognizing them, move on to the next
arrivals.

GEORGE
Try to smile, will you? There's

"Ladyfriend?' What kind of word
is that?
FAITH

It's like 'fucking.' Only you don't
tell anyone about it.

A long, long silence. Faith slowly begins to scrub the
breakfast dishes. Words form in George's mouth but no
sound comes out. He stares at Faith's back, only the
clatter of china resounding through the kitchen.

Finally, George speaks.

GEORGE
You want to talk about it?

Faith scratches the leavings of some egg on a dish.
George strides to the sink.

GEORGE
Don't you think we should talk

FAITH ;

GEORGE
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT ITII!

George is suddenly spent, he is left staring at Faith.
But she drills him back, she does not give way at all.

Their voices drop to some icy pitch.

GEORGE
I'm leaving.

FAITH
Good.

GEORGE

him.

He stares at Faith, daring her tv look up. But Faith re-
fuses, her eyes remain on the pieces of dish, her fingers
still silently fitting them together.

pouring in milk and cream, setting up plates, dropping in
toast, a dexterous mother.

SHERRY
Jill, Marianne, Molly -- Bre-aak-fast!

Perpetual motion now, Sherry adjusting place mats, filling
glasses of milk, flipping burnt toast into a rectangle of
water in the sink, tucking the phone into her shoulder,
spilling the beef onto plates, punching out a number on
the telephone.

SHERRY

Are you the service or are you Dr.
Moore? -- You're Dr. Moore's nurse --

George scribbling notes on a pad that hangs from the rear-
view mirror -- hands the notes to the children and pushes
them out of the car. "Bye, Dad," "Have a nice day, Dad,"
"Get your car washed, Dad, it's all filthy." The children
run for the empty school doorway. George watches them
disappear inside.

MOVE IN on George. A film of sweat on his face, his body 484
collapsing with fatigue.

GEORGE
Jeezus.

His head tilts back wearily on the seat.

How does she do it?

George takes one last glimpse at the school, blurry
shapes of activity inside the windows. He breathes a
huge sigh of relief and drives off.

cupful of razor-sharp pencils. Beside the pencil holder,
an electric sharpener. George inserts a pencil in the

a wispy curl of graphite. He now replaces the pencil in

takes the opportunity to go to the bathroom, glancing out
the window as she goes. The TV show comes back on. Faith
and Molly continue with their game as Jill remains glued
to the set. Marianne, however, remains at the window;

she giggles.

JILL

Faith lies in the tub, her eyes closed, enjoying these
first few moments she has had to herself in a long time.
She opens her eyes, reaches for some bath salts in a
cabinet, sprinkles them in the bath. Also in the cabinet,
a Chinese box, Faith lifts the lid; a half-smoked stick
of marijuana, a box of matches. She lights the joint,
inhales it deeply, enjoys it.

Some trace of song forms on her lips, she begins to hum.
It is the same song she and George began together last
night. She sings softly, plaintively, sldwly:

FAITH

"SI JE COMMENCE A T'AIMEIZ

As for you, Mrs. Dunlap, to deny
the father the right to take the
children to school three times a

FAITH
I'll think about it.
HOWARD
You better -- here he comes now --
113A George and Spinelli block them on the courthouse steps. 113A
SPINELLI
(interrupting, ahead
of George)

Mr. Dunlap wants to pick up the
children tonight at seven instead
of six -- he has a late appointment
in San Francisco.

HOWARD
Under no circumstances --

It's all right, Howard, I won't
be home anyway.

What do you mean you won't be
there?
FAITH
My father's sick.

George blinks, pulls at his coat.

GEORGE
(tense)
What's the matter with him?

FAITH
I don't know. He went in for some
tests. And they're keeping him

there --
GEORGE

So you're going up -- ?
FAITH

I'll be back Monday. Mrs. McGovern
is going to sit. You can pick them
up whenever you want tonight.

GEORGE
I'll bring the kids up to your
parents.

There is a moment. Spinelli and Katz look at each other.

FAITH
No, George.

- GEORGE
Yeah, Iwill. It's easy.

FAITH
Please, George, don't. They're okay.

GEORGE
Well give French my love -- tell him
I'll be coming up.

INT. HOSPITAL - NAPA - DAY 114

George walking down the corridor. Faith emerges from a
bathroom off the corridor. They see each other, move
down the hall together.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM 115

FRENCH, Faith's father, is in bed, a hulk of a man, fragile
now, a breathing machine beside him, the tubes detached for
the moment; green coils for breathing in, pink coils for
breathing out, a balloon to register inhalation and exhal-
ation, the whole operation monitored by an oxygen tank
which looms over the bed.

An IV drips into French's arm. On the floor underneath
the mattress, a drain bottle with a tube leading to a
catheter. The room is a tangle of tubes, drips and drains,
coils; but discernible behind all the rubber and hardware,
a man.is there -- French.

Faith and George freeze at the sight of French, shocked
by his condition. Now Faith moves towards her father.

FAITH
Poppa. -
FRENCH
Where's your mother?
FAITH
Outside.
FRENCH

How're you doin', honey?
(seeing George hanging
back)

You too, George.

George hurries over, leans in from the other side.

FRENCH
Good to see you two together.

GEORGE
Thanks, French.

FRENCH
You are together?

GEORGE
Sure.

FRENCH
"Sure'?

GEORGE
I mean we are.

FRENCH
(to George, a faint
smile)
You wouldn't shit me, would you,
George?

GEORGE
(after a moment)
No, Poppa.

Silence, as French takes this in.

FRENCH
I miss that house -- how's that
house?
GEORGE FAITH
It needs some work. Terrific.
FRENCH
'Terrific.' 'It needs some work.'
You two better get together.
FAITH

George is right, Poppa, when you

get out, you'll bring your tools
a one Sunday... like you always
Ce

FRENCH
Cut it out, will you?
(drilling Faith and
George)
You're a couple of lousy liars.

George and Faith stand there with French. There is an
exchange through the silence among the three of them.

FAITH
(speaking up)
You're right, Poppa. We've broken up.

Pause.

FAITH
Forgive me,

FRENCH
(taking her hand)
Not a chance.
Silence again.

FRENCH
George --

He motions him to move close. Faith releases French's
hand, steps away.

FRENCH
What's going on?
GEORGE
I don't know.
French smiles.
FRENCH

(to George)
Did I ever tell you about the time
you went on your honeymoon, I
entered your father in the Bass
Derby -- he cheated, hooked that
smallmouth with live bait.
Sonofabitch -- your father couldn't
even tie a fly.

GEORGE
My father was an asshole and you
know it.

FRENCH
But he was the only asshole you
ever had.

GEORGE

No, French, you are.

smallmouth like to lay around it...

GEORGE
What big rock?

FRENCH
You know --

GEORGE

You'll show me.

French leans up, sees Faith at the window, she is careful
to give George and French some room.

French motions to George to move close.

CLOSEUP -

Watching,

FRENCH
I ought to kick your ass around
the block --

GEORGE

(leaning in, intense)
Do it, French. What are you laying
around here for anyway?

FRENCH
They lassoed me.

French is failing badly, George kneels by French's bed.

GEORGE
I'm here, French, stay with me.

Faith's eyes riveted on George, who is shaking.

FRENCH
{reaching out, taking
George by the neck,
embracing him)
Okay, son.

George rests his head on French's chest. French starts
to breathe hard, Faith runs for the hallway.

French is thrashing now, George trying to hold him down,
CHARLOTTE, Faith's mother, comes rushing in, followed by a
NURSE.

CHARLOTTE
(grabbing George)
Please, please, give her some room --

A Technician enters, he and the Nurse work fast and ner-
vously to get the breathing machine tubes attached.

George moves closer to French.

NURSE
(to George)
Please, sir --

For an instant George is mangled in the tubes, French's
breath becomes wildly irregular, Charlotte and Faith
manage to pull George away.

he approaches the lead car but Charlotte blocks his path.

GEORGE
Hello, Charlotte. I'm sorry.

CHARLOTTE
Thank you.

GEORGE
Would you like me to ride with you
and Faith?

Faith and Sherry have come over, they each take George's
arm as he faces Charlotte.

CHARLOTTE
There's no room.

GEORGE
No room or no place?

CHARLOTTE
No place.

FAITH

Maybe you can squeeze in the second
car with the children?

SHERRY
Yeah, I'll go with Uncle Ned.

ON GEORGE - AT A TABLE
Sitting alone, poking at a salad. From time to time, he
looks up at the other guests, couples cozy at tables, lit
by candles. He puts his fork down wearily, listens to the
music, DOROTHY at the organ playing "Some Enchanted Evening."

She sings a little.

AT THE DOOR 118A
Faith appears. The Maitre d', STEVE, hurries to her.

Oh, Mr. Dunlap's right over here.

Faith looks over to the table where George is sitting,
now points elsewhere.

FAITH

All this time?

George sits.

What's she going to do? Is she
going away -- ?

The Waiter comes over, carrying plates.

WAITER

Did you want your food served here,
sir

GEORGE FAITH
Yes. No,

After a moment, the Waiter tentatively sets a plate of
Scandanavian salmon down in front of George.

That's not enough dill for you.

Faith?

You mean you want me to get my
own?

GEORGE

No, I'm not hungry.

FAITH
Good. Neither am I.

The Waiter arrives with the extra sauce. George dabs at
it.

FAITH
Here, give it to me --

She fixes the plate for him, arranging the dill and the
sauce. George cuts a plece. He likes it better now.

GEORGE
I'm sorry. You want a bite?

FAITH
That piece in the center.

She reaches over and takes it. In a moment, the two of
them have devoured the salmon.

Dorothy continues to play. They sit in silence,

what else -~ and listen to your
office politics and advise you and
coddle you and fuck you and be up
at six to get the children off and
out of your way.

GEORGE
Is that right? Well I'll tell you
something --

From the next table, a couple looks over, the MAN in double-
knits, the WIFE, her curly hair piled precariously high.

HAROLD (MAN)
Hey, pipe down, buddy, we're paying
for our dinner, too --

GEORGE

(lowering his voice)
I'd come off the train and you'd
always be so goddam nice and yes,
you were a good cook, and yes, you
were a good mother, and yes, you
could lay it on for my old college
friends, and yes, you were smart
about elections, and you want to
know something, I was in awe of
you --

In awe of me?! What the hell do
you mean by that?

You, the children! Four children!
You raised them with the back of

give me a pat on the back for a
profile on the fucking greenskeeper
at Pebble Beach. You were changing
diapers and scraping shit off the
walls but you were creating lives!
And what was I doing? I was
studying the fucking Bermuda grass
and counting the goddam dimples on
a golfball.

(pauses)

Don't you understand? I worshipped
you.

FAITH
Then for God's sake, why didn't you
treat me that way? You were always
yelling, George, you were always
angry -- you have a terrible temper --

GEORGE
But you know I don't mean it --

FAITH
Tell that to the children --

GEORGE
I was afraid, don't you understand?

Afraid of what?

GEORGE
I couldn't hack it. I felt Like I

The Waiter disappears.

GEORGE
Forget about Sandy. What about
him? The Redneck?

FAITH
The who?!

GEORGE
Sam Stud. The character with all
the cotton in his crotch. Do you
do it on the backhoe?

FAITH
Are you talking about Frank?

GEORGE
Frank! Yes, Frank! What a name!
I had a counselor named Frank at
sleepaway camp. Franks always love
the outdoors.
