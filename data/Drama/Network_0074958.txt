This story is about Howard Beale .
who was the network news anchorman

on UBS-TV --
A BANK OF FOUR COLOR TELEVISION MONITORS

Ie is 7:14 P.M., Monday, September 22, 1975, and we are
watching the network news programs on CBS, NBC, ABC and
UBS-TV, the network of our story. The AUDIO is OFF;
and head shots cf WALTER CRONKITE, JOHN CHANCELLOR,
HOWARD K. SMITH and HARRY RFEASONFR, and, of course,

the anchorman of our network, HOWARD BEALE, silently
flict and flicker across the four television screens,
interspersed with the news of the day -- Presidenr
Ford's new Energy Program, a hearing on Patty Hearst's
beil, truce viclations in Beirut, bus-ing trouble in
Boston... NARRATION continues OVER -~

NARRATOR (Contd)
~- In his time, Howard Beale had
been a mandarin of television, the
grand old man of news, with s HUT
rating of 16 and a 28 audience
share -- . :

 

CAMERA MOVES IN to isolate HOWARD BEALE, who is
-everything an anchorman sheulc be -- 58 years old,
splver-haired, magisterial, dignified to the point of
divinity. NARRATION continues OVER --

NARRATOR (Contd)

-- In 1969, however, he Fell to a

22 share, and, by 1972, he was down

to a 15 share. In 1973, his wife

died, and he was left a childless

widower with an & rating and @ 12 ;

share. He became morose ard isolated, !
2 began te drink heavily, and, on

September 22, 1975, he was fired,

effective in two weeks. The news

was broken to him by Max Schumacher --

_ Plastered and on a drunken laughing jag --

HOWARD
(clutching the corner

falling)
When was this?

MAX
1951 --

HOWARD
I was at CBS with Ed Murrow in
1951. Didn't you join Murrow
in 1951? --

MAX
Must've been 1950 then. I was at
NBC. Morning News. Associate
producer. I was a kid, twenty-six
years old. Anyway, they were
building the lower level on the
George Washington Bridge, and we
were doing a remote there. Except
nobody told me! --

For some reason, this knocks them out. HOWARD,
wheezing with suppressed laughter, clutches the
Mailbox. MAX has to shout to get the rest of the
story out --

MAX (Contd)

-- ten after seven in the morning --
I get a call -- “Where the hell are
you? -- You're supposed to be on
the George Washington Bridge!" --

I jump out of bed -- I throw my
raincoat over my pajamas -- I run
down the stairs -- I get out in the
street -~ I flag a cab -- I jump in
-- I say: “Take me to the middle
of the George Washington Bridge!" --

It's too much again. The TWO MEN dissolve into silent
wheezing spasms of laugh -

MAX
You'll get a hell of a rating,
I'll tell you that, a fifty

HOWARD
You think so?

MAX

We could make a series out of it.
Suicide of the Week. Hell, why
limit ourselves? Execution of the

from BEALE and HUNTER, everybody else is in their 20's

all casually dressed. This is the daily run-down

HERRON
Yeah.

-~ is sitting in a typical panel discussion grouping,
flanked by three MEN and a WOMAN, two white, two
black, all very urban guerilla, in fatigues, sun
glasses and combat boots. MISS HOBBS looks calmly
into camera and says:

LAUREEN HOBBS (ON SCREEN)
The Communist Party believes that
the most pressing political necessity
today is the consolidation of the
revolutionary, radical and democratic
movements into a United Front --

Room still dark. ON SCREEN, NUMBERED WHITE LEADER is
rolling down --

HERRON
What we're going to see now is
something really sensational.
The Flagstaff Independent Bank
in Arizona was ripped off last
week by a terrorist group called
the Ecumenical Liberation Army,
and they themselves actually took
movies of the rip-off while they
were ripping it off. It's in
black and white, but wait'll
you see it --

The SCREEN suddenly erupts into film of the interior
of a bank being entered in the wake of THREE MEN, two
of them black, and TWO WOMEN, one black and one white.
They disperse to various parts of the bank as if they
were here on legitimate business --

DIANA
The Ecumenical Liberation Army
-~ is that the one that
kidnapped Patty Hearst?

HERRON
No, that's the Symbionese :
Liberation Army. This is the
Ecumenical Liberation Army.
They're the ones who kidnapped
Mary Ann Gifford three weeks ago.
There's a hell of a lot of
liberation armies in the
revolutionary underground and
a lot of kidnapped heiresses.
“That's Mary Ann Gifford --

This last in reference to the young white woman on
screen who is lugging a shopping bag as she joins a
line at a teller's window --

DIANA
You mean, they actually shot
this film while they were ripping
off the bank?

HERRON
Yeah, wait'll you see it. I
don't know whether to edit or
leave it raw like this. That's the
Great Ahmed Khan; he's the leader --

ON SCREEN, the film has gone out of focus a couple of
times and bounced meaninglessly around the bank and
finally settled on a large, powerful black man at one
of the desks, presumably writing out a series of
deposit slips --

DIANA
This is terrific stuff. Where
did you get it?

HERRON 1
I got everything through Laureen
Hobbs. She's my contact for
all this stuff.

DIANA
I thought she was straight '
Communist Party. ,

HERRON
Right. But she's trying to unify
all the factions in the
underground, so she knows . )
everybody.

ON SCREEN, the CAMERA has whooshed amateurishly about,
unfocuses and focuses again to pick up MARY ANN GIFFORD
bending over her shopping bag and pulling out a Czech
service submachine gun 9 Parabellum which she points to
the ceiling and apparently fires; the FILM is silent,
but the reactions of everyone around suggest clearly
something was fired. The FILM gets fragmented and
panicky about here, as does the activity in the bank.
The PHONE at MAX's elbow BUZZES. MAX picks it up.

in b.g. a bank hold-
up goes on on screen)

swarthy, coiffed and moustachioed. They find seats on

This is Bill Herron from our
West Coast Special Programs
Department -- Barbara Schlesinger
~- George Bosch -- Tommy
Pellegrino -- Look, I just saw
some rough footage of a special
Bill's doing on the revolutionary
underground. Most of it's
tedious stuff of Laureen Hobbs
and four fatigue jackets muttering

mutilated Marxism. But he's got

about eight minutes of a bank
robbery that is absolutely
sensational. Authentic stuff.
Actually shot while the robbery
was going on. Remember the Mary
Ann Gifford kidnapping? Well,
it's that bunch of nuts. She's
in the film shooting off machine
guns. Really terrific footage.
I think we can get a hell of a
movie of the week out of it,
maybe even a series.

PELLEGRINO
A series out of what? What're
we talking about?

DIANA
Look, we've got a bunch of
hobgoblin radicals. called the
Ecumenical Liberation Army who
go around taking home movies
of themselves robbing banks.
Maybe they'll take movies of
themselves kidnapping heiresses,
hijacking 747's, bombing bridges,
assassinating ambassadors.
We'd open each week's segment
with that authentic footage,
hire a ‘couple of writers to
write some story behind that
footage, and we've got
ourselves a series.

robbing guerillas?

Why not? They've got Strike
Force, Task Force, SWAT -- why
not Che Guevara and his own
little mod squad? Listen, I
sent you all a concept analysis
report yesterday. Did any of
you read it?

(apparently not)
Well, in a nutshell, it said the
American people are turning sullen.
They've been clobbered on all
sides by Vietnam, Watergate, the
inflation, the depression.
They've turned off, shot up,
and they’ve fucked themselves
limp. And nothing helps. Evil
still triumphs over all, Christ
is a.dope-dealing pimp, even sin
turned out to be impotent. The
whole world seems to be going
nuts and flipping off into space
like an abandoned balloon. So
-- this concept analysis report
concludes -~- the American people
want somebody to articulate their
rage for them. I've been telling
you people since I took this job
six months ago that I want angry
shows. I don't want conventional
programming on this network. I
want counter-culture. I want
anti-establishment.

She closes the door.

DIANA (Contd)
Now, I don't want to play butch
boss with you people. But when
I. took over this department,
it had the worst programming
record in television history.
This network hasn't one show in
the top twenty. This network is
an industry joke. We better
start putting together one winner
for next September. I want a
show developed, based on the
activities of a terrorist group.

of Bolsheviks. I want ideas from

MAX (Contd)
I'd like to know why that whole
debasement of the News Division
announced at the stockholders’
meeting today was kept secret from
me. You and I go back twenty
years, Ed. I took this job with
your personal assurance that you
would back my autonomy against
any encroachment. But ever since
CCA acquired control of the UBS
Systems ten months ago, Hackett's
been taking over everything. Who
the hell's running this network,
you or some conglomerate called
CCA? I mean, you're the Chairman
of the Systems Group, and Frank
Hackett's just CCA's hatchet man.
Nelson here -- for Pete's sake, he's
the president of the network -- he
hasn't got anything to say about
anything anymore. “Who the hell's
running this company, you or CCA?

RUDDY

(murmurs )
I told you at the stockholders’
meeting, Max, that we would discuss
all that at our regular meeting
tomorrow morning. If you had been
patient, I would've explained to
you that I too thought Frank Hackett
precipitate and that the reorgani-
zation of the News Division would
not .be executed until everyone,
specifically you, Max, had been
consulted and satisfied. Instead,
you sulked off like a child and

vengaged. this network in a. shocking

and disgraceful episode. Your
position here is no longer tenable
regardless of how management is
restructured. I expect you to
bring in your resignation at ten
o'clock tomorrow morning, and we
will coordinate our statements to
the least detriment of everyone.

Yes, I think we should put Beale

on this you couldn't buy for a

night. You're not going to get
something like this dumped in your

Howard Beale got up there last

RUDDY

(takes a folded piece

of paper from his

Yes. I think Hackett's overstepped
himself. There's some kind of
corporate maneuvering going on,
Max. Hackett is clearly forcing
a confrontation. That would
account for his behavior at the
stockholders' meeting. However,
I think he's making a serious
mistake with this Beale business.
Cc. C. and A. would never make. such
an open act of brigandage,
especially against the News
Division. They are specifically
enjoined against any manipulation
of the News Division in the
consent decree. I suspect C. C.
and A. will be upset by Hackett's
presumptuousness, certainly Mr.
Jensen will. So I'm going to let
Hackett have his head for awhile.
He just might lose it over this
Beale business.

(places the paper

on MAX's desk)
I'd like you to reconsider your

resignation.

(moves to the couch,

sits, crosses his legs,

I have to assume Hackett wouldn't
take such steps without some
support on the C. C. and A. board.
I'll have to go directly to Mr.
Jensen. When that happens, I'm
going to need every friend I've
got. And I certainly don't want
Hackett's people in all the
divisional positions. So I'd
like you to stay on, Max.

MAX sitting alone behind his desk in a dark office lit
only by his desk lamp, watching the Network News Show
starring HOWARD BEALE on his office console --

NARRATION
The initial response to the new
Howard Beale was not auspicatory.
The press was without exception
hostile and industry reaction
negative. The ratings for the
‘Thursday and Friday show were
both 14 and with a 37 share,
but Monday's rating dropped
two points, clearly suggesting
the novelty had worn off --

On the office console, HOWARD BEALE doesn't seem too
much different than he had always been. He scowls,
frowns, seems to be muttering --

NARRATION (Contd)
-~ Indeed, Howard Beale played
his new role of latter-day
prophet poorly. He was, after
all, a newsman, not an actor.
He was uncertain, uncomfortable,
sometimes inaudible. The general
feeling around the network was
that this new Howard Beale would
be aborted in a matter of days. --

On the office console, the Network News Show has come
to an end; the CLOSING THEME MUSIC emerges into
SOUND, and the show's CREDITS begin to roll. MAX
Clicks off the set, folds his hands on the desk and
sits glumly regarding his folded hands. After a
moment, he becomes aware of another presence in the
room and looks to the doorway where DIANA CHRISTENSON
is standing, wearing a white blouse and dark slacks
and carrying her jacket and purse. If we haven't

DIANA

(entering the office)
Did you know there are a number
of psychics working as licensed
brokers on Wall Street?

(she sits across from

MAX, fishes a cigarette

out of her purse)
Some of them counsel their clients
by use of Tarot cards. They're
all pretty successful, even in a
bear market and selling short.
I met one of them a couple of
weeks ago and thought of doing
a show around her -- The Wayward
Witch of Wall Street, something
like that. But, of course, if
her tips were any good, she
could wreck the market. So I
called her this morning and
asked her how she was on
predicting the future. She said
she was occasionally prescient.
“For example," she said, “I
just had a fleeting vision of
you sitting in an office with
a craggy middle-aged man with
whom you are or will be
emotionally involved."
And here I am.

MAX
She does all this with Tarot cards?

DIANA
No, this one operates on
parapsychology. She has trance-
like episodes and feels things
in her energy field. I think
this lady can be very useful
to you, Max.

MAX
In what way?

DIANA
Well, you put on news shows,
and here's someone who can
predict tomorrow's news for you.
Her name, aptly enough, is Sibyl.

give her two minutes of trance

could oraculate. Then next week,
everyone tunes in to see how

MAX

DIANA

Your network news show is going
to need some help, Max, if it's
going to hold. Beale doesn't
do the angry man thing well at
all. He's too kvetchy. He's
being irascible. We want a
prophet, not a curmudgeon. He
should do more apocalyptic doom.
I think you should take on a
couple of writers to write some
jeremiads for him. I see you
don't fancy my suggestions.

MAX
Hell, you're not being serious,
are you?

DIANA
Oh, I'm serious. The fact is,
I could make your Beale show the
highest-rated news show in

DIANA

I'd like to program it for you,

lost puppies. So I don't think
I'll listen to any protestations

you and I could work this out

Well, Diana, you bring all your
ideas up at the meeting tomorrow.
Because, if you don't, I will.
I think Howard is making a goddam
fool of himself, and so does
everybody Howard and I know in

about resigning, but I do know

My little visit here tonight
was just a courtesy made out
of respect for your stature
in the industry and because
I've personally admired you
ever since I was a kid majoring

Missouri. But sooner or later,

DIANA stands in the back in the shadows. On the
SHOW MONITOR, JACK SNOWDEN, BEALE's replacement,
has been doing the news straight --
SNOWDEN (ON MONITOR)
«--Oil ministers of the OPEC nations
meeting in Vienna still haven't decided
how much more to increase the price of
oil next Wednesday. Iran and some of the

Arab states want to jack up the price
by as much as twenty percent --

The STAGE MANAGER nods, passes on the instructions to his A.D.
on the studio floor. On the SHOW MONITOR, we see footage of
the OPEC Vienna meeting, lots of Arab headresses and bearded
Levantine faces at conference tables, and we are hearing the
VOICE of Edward Fletcher in Vienna --

FLETCHER (ON MONITOR) :
This has probably been the mort divisive
meeting the oil-producing states have
ever had. The thirteen nations of OPEC
have still not been able to decide by
how much to increase the price of oil --

On the SHOW MONITOR, the footage flicks to Sheikh Zaki Yamani
being interviewed by a corps of correspondents outside the
meeting hall --

FLETCHER (V.0.)
Saudi Arabian oil minister Sheikh Zaki
Yamani flew to London yesterday for
further consultations with his government.
He returned to the Vienna meetings today--

Nobody in the control room is paying. too much attention to Yamani;
they are all watching .the double .bank. of black-and-white monitors
vhich show HOWARD BEALE entering the studio, drenched, hunched,
staring gauntly off into his own space, moving with single-minded
purpose across the. studio floor past cameras and ASSISTANT DIRECTORS,
CAMERAMEN, SOUND MEN, ELECTRICIANS and. ASSOCIATE PRODUCERS, to

his desk which is being vacated for him by JACK SNOWDEN. On the

HOWARD (ON MONITOR)

I don't have to tell you things

are bad. Everybody knows things
~ are bad. It's a depression.
Everybody's out of work or scared
of losing their job, the dollar
buys a nickel's worth, banks are
going bust, shopkeepers keep a
gun under the counter, punks
are running wild in the streets,
and there's nobody anywheres who
seems to know what to do, and
there's no end to it. We know
the air's unfit to breathe and
our food is unfit to eat, and
we sit and watch our tee-vees
while some local newscaster
tells us today we had fifteen
homicides and sixty-three
violent crimes, as if that's
the way it's supposed to be.
We all know things are bad.
Worse than bad. They're crazy.
It's like everything's going
crazy. So we don't go out any
more. We sit in the house, and
slowly the world we live in
gets smaller, and all we ask is
please, at least leave us alone
in our own. living rooms. Let me
have my toaster and my tee-vee
and my hair-dryer and my steel-
belted radials, and I won't say
anything, just leave us alone.
Well, I'm not going to leave you
alone. I want you to get mad --

CAROLINE opens the’ window and looks out on the
rain-swept streets of the upper East Side, the
bulking, anonymous apartment houses and the occasional
brownstones. It is thunder dark; a distant clap of
THUNDER CRASHES somewhere off and LIGHTNING shatters
the dank darkness. In the sudden HUSH following the
thunder, a thin voice down the block can be heard
shouting:

THIN VOICE (0.S.)

MAX joins his daughter at the window. RAIN sprays

black RAIN of the streets --

moving towards a large display board at the far end
of the table stretching the length of the wall. This
is an improvised programming “board." It shows --
through movable heavy cardboard pieces -- what all

days of the week --

DIANA
Wednesday riight looks weak on

(sinking casually into

crossing his legs,

flashing a fully-capped

As a matter of fact, I think we .
met during the 1972 McGovern-for-
President campaign, of which, I
am proud to say, I was a principal
‘fund raiser --

DIANA

(leaning across the desk

to shake his hand)
No, I'm afraid not. Now, Hy, we're
running a little late, so I'd like
to get right to it. I havem idea
for an hour television series, and
I'd like to lay it in your lap.
Here's the back-up story. The hero
is white-collar middle-class, an
architect, aviation engineer,
anything, a decent law-abiding
man. He lives with his wife and
daughter in a large city. His

 
 

O

oa.

KE }

86

DIANA (Contd)
wife and daughter are raped and
he's mugged. He appeals to the
police, but their hands are tied
by the Warren Court decisions.
There's nothing but pornography
in the movies, and vandals bomb
his church. The animals are
taking over. So he decides to
take the law into his own hands.
He buys a gun, practices till he's
an expert. He takes up karate,
becomes a black belt, an adept in
Kung Fu and all the other martial
arts. Now, he starts walking the
streets of the city, decoying muggers
into preying on him. He kung fu's
them all. Pretty soon, he's joined
by a couple of neighbors. What ,
we've got now is a vigilante group. 1
That's the name of the show -- the '
Vigilantes. The idea is, if the '
law won't protect the decent people,
they have to take the law into their ’
own hands, ‘

NORMAN
That may be he most fascistic idea '
I've heard in years.

DIANA
Right.

NORMAN
And a shameless steal from a movie
called "Death Wish."

DIANA
I-know. And, so far, "Death Wish"
has grossed seventeen million domes-
tic. It obviously struck a pulse in
Americans. I want to strike the
same pulse. Now, let me finish, Hy.
The format is simple. Every week a
crime is committed, and the police
are helpless to deal with it. The
victim turns to our group of vigi-
lantes., What the hell, it's FBI,
Mission Impossible, Kojack, except
the heroes are ordinary citizens,
your neighbors and mine.

NORMAN
(standing)
I find the whole thing repulsive.

DIANA
You give me a pilot script we can
use as a movie of the week for
January, and I'11 commit to twelve
segments on the basis of that script.

NORMAN
(turns)
You'll commit on the basis of the
pilot script?

DIANA

That's what I said. That's a three
million dollar commitment. I figure
you could skim a quarter of a million
for yourself out of that. Of course,
we all know you're a highly principled
political liberal, and you may find
this kind of show repulsive --

NORMAN

(slowly sitting again)
Well -- not necessarily. I deplore
vigilante tactics, of course, but
the vigilante tradition is a profound,
even proud tradition in the American
social fabric. This sort of program
also offers opportunities for coming
to grips with the burning issues of
our times, to do meaningful drama and
at the same time providing mass enter-
tainment.

DIANA
Beautiful, Hy.

NORMAN
Who do I talk numbers with,
Charlie Kinkaid?

DIANA

Right. I'1l call Charlie and tell
him we'll go to forty thousand

for the first script. If you come
in with anything good, Hy, I'11
slot you.on Wednesday nights at
eight coming right off the Howard
Beale Show, and that's the best
lead-in you'll ever get.

NORMAN opens the door to leave, looks out into the
outer office, closes the door, turns to DIANA.

He opens the door and goes out. On his heels, GLENN
KOSSOFF is already usheringin BILL HERRON, LAUREEN
HOBBS, (a handsome black woman of 35 in Afro and das~
hiki); SAM HAYWOOD, (late 50's, a shaggy, unkempt law-
yer in the Clarence Darrow tradition, galluses, string-
tie, folksy drawl and all); a younger lawyer, ROBERT
MURPHY, (early 30's, Harvard intellectual type); and
THREE AGENTS from the William Morris Officenamed LENNIE,
WALLIE and ED, (ali in their mid-30's, all wearing trim
blue suits and all indistinguishable from each other).
DIANA rises to greet them, extends her hand to LAUREEN
HOBBS -~

DIANA
Christ, you brought half the William
Morris West Coast office with you.
I'm Diana Christenson, a racist lackey
of the imperialist ruling circles.

LAUREEN
I'm Laureen Hobbs, a bad-ass Commie

nigger.

DIANA
Sounds like the basis of a firm
friendship.

We're going to need more chairs -~

In b.g., meanwhile, SCHLESINGER is exchanging hellos
with the THREE WILLIAM MORRIS AGENTS and is being in-
troduced to the LAWYERS and looking at baby pictures
proferred to her by one of the agents. It's ali jolly

Handshakes, nods, smiles, everybody begins to sit. The
SECRETARY goes around taking coffee orders --

HAYWOOD

(an old union lawyer,

given to peroration)
Well, Ms. Christenson, just what
the hell's this all about? Be-
cause when a national television
network in the person of bubby
here --

(indicates HERRON)
“- comes to me and says he wants
to put the ongoing struggle of the
oppressed masses on prime-time
television, I have to regard this
askance --

More chairs are brought in. DIANA would answer HAYWOOD
but he booms along, beginning to hit his stride --

HAYWOOD (Contd)
I have to figure this as an anti-
thetical distraction. The thesis
here, if you follow me, is that
the capitalist state is in a ter-
minal condition now, and the anti-
thesis is the maturation of the
fascist state, and when the corre-
lative appendages of the fascist
state come and say to me they want
to give the revolution a weekly
hour of prime-time television,
I’ve got to figure this is pre-
ventive co-optation, right? --

The necessary chairs are in by now, and everyone is
seated. The SECRETARY has gone off to fetch the coffee.
A sudden HUSH follows HAYWOOD's Hegelian instruction,
and DIANA would answer, but HAYWOOD is now center-stage,
into the full swell of rhetoric --

Oh, shit, Mr. Haywood, if you're not
interested in my offer, why the hell

Me along?

MURPHY
(Mr. Cool)
What Mr. Haywood was saying, Ms.

Ms. Hobbs, wants it up front that

has to be entirely in her control.

DIANA

people be interested in making such

looks to LAUREEN HOBBS.

LAUREEN
The Ecumenical Liberation Army is
an ultra-left sect creating political
confusion with wildcat violence and
pseudo~insurrectionary acts, which
the Communist Party does not endorse.
The American masses are not yet ready
for open revolt. We would not want
to produce a television show cele-
brating historically deviational
terrorism.

DIANA
Even better. I see the story this
way. Poor little rich girl kid-
napped by ultra-left sect. She
falls in love with the leader of
the gang, converts to his irrespon-
sible violence. But then she meets
you, understands the true nature of
the ongoing people's struggle for
a better society, and, in an emotion-
drenched scene, she leaves her devia-
tional lover and dedicates herself to
you and the historical inevitability
of the socialist state.

LAUREEN
(smiles)
That would be better, of course.

ED
What kind of numbers are we talking,
Diana?

DIANA
We'll give you our top deal, which
I think is two fifteen and twenty-
five. You'll have to talk to
Charlie Kinkaid about that.. But

DIANA (Continued)
in, The way I see this series is
every week we open with the authen-
tic footage of an act of political
terrorism, taken on the spot and
in the actual moment; then we go
into the drama behind the opening
film footage. That's your job, Ms.
Hobbs. You've got to get the
Ecumenicals to bring in that film
for us. The network can't deal
with them directly. They are,
after all, wanted criminals.

LAUREEN
The Ecumenicals are an undisciplined
ultra-left gang, and the leader is
an eccentric to say the least. He
calls himself the Great Ahmed Khan
and wears a hussar's shako.

DIANA
Ms. Hobbs, I'm offering you an hour
of prime-time television every week
into which you can stick whatever
Propaganda you want. We're talking
about thirty to fifty million people
a shot. That's a lot better than
handing out mimeographed pamphlets
on ghetto street corners.

LAUREEN
I'll have to take this matter to
the Central Committee, and I'd
better check this out with the
Great Ahmed Khan.

DIANA

I'll.be in L.A. until Saturday, and
I'd like to get this thing rolling.

HERRON and KOSSOFF)
That's going to be cur Wednesday

HOWARD (Contd)
And woe is us if it ever falls in
the hands of the wrong people.
And that's why woe is us that
Edward George Ruddy died. Because
this network isnow in the hands
of CC and A the Communications
Corporation of America. We've
got a new Chairman of the Board,
a man named Frank Hackett now
sitting in Mr. Ruddy's office on
the twentieth floor. And when
the twelfth largest company in
the world controls the most awesome
goddamned propaganda force in the
whole godless world, who knows what
shit will be peddled for truth on
this tube? So, listen to me!
Television is not the truth! Tele-
vision is a goddamned amusement
park, that's what television is!
Television is a circus, a carnival,
a travelling troupe of acrobats and
story-tellers, singers and dancers,
jugglers, side-show freaks, lion-
tamers and football players. We're
in the boredom-killing business!
If you want truth, go to God, go
to your guru, go to yourself because
that's the only place you'll ever
find any real truth! But, man,
you're never going to get any truth
from us, We'll tell you anything
you want to hear. We lie like hell!
We'll ‘tell you Kojack always gets
the killer, and nobody ever gets
cancer in Archie Bunker's house.
‘And no matter how much trouble the
hero is in, don't worry: just look
at your watch -- at the end of the
hour, he's going to win. We'll
tell you any shit you want to hear!
We deal in illusion, man! None of
it's true! But you people sit there
-- all of you -- day after day, night
after night, all ages, colors, creeds
=- we're all you know. You're
beginning to believe this illusion
we're spinning here. You're be-
ginning to think the tube is reality
and your own lives are unreal. You

At which point, HOWARD BEALE, sweating and red-eyed with
his prophetic rage, collapses to the floor in a pro-
phetic swoon.

INT: CC AND A CONFERENCE ROOM ~ CC AND A 123.
BUILDING - MONDAY, JANUARY 27

A Valhalla of a room taking up the 43rd and 44th floors
of the CC and A Building. It is dark and theatrical,
the lighting at the moment being provided by the shaft
of LIGHT issuing from a slide projector at the back of
the room onto a large SCREEN on the raised podium where
FRANK HACKETT in banker's gray stands making his annual
report. On the SCREEN, we see charts of figures, one
after the other, which accompany HACKETT's explication.
A little red ARROW darts from one figure to another as
HACKETT drones on. Seated in a semi-circular arrange-
ment like a miniature United Nations are 214 SENIOR
EXECUTIVES, (late 40's, 50's, and 60's). They each
have their own little desks with swivel chairs, pin-
spot lights, piles of bound company reports, and name
plates giving their names and companies they represent.
NOTE one specific CHAIR in the dead center of the first
row that swivels back and forth, back and forth --

HACKETT

(on podium)
~~ UBS was running at a cash-flow
breakeven point after taking into
account one hundred and ten million
dollars of negative cash-flow from
the network. Note please the added
thirty-five millions resulting from
the issuance of the subordinated sink-
ing debentures. It was clear the fat
on the network had to be flitched off --

Please note an increase in pro-

enal success of the Howard Beale
show. I expect a positive cash-
flow for the entire complex of
forty-five million achievable in
this fiscal year, a year, in short,
ahead of schedule --

ANOTHER ANGLE closer on the swivelling CHAIR but still
not revealing its occupant.

HACKETT (Contd)
I go beyond that. This network may
well be the most significant profit
center of the communications complex --

HACKETT (Contd)

SNOW drifting down. CROWD of overcoated condolers flood-

condolers into their respective limousines. A curious
crowd of PASSERSBY watch. MAX SCHUMACHER threads his
way through the CRUSH to where DIANA CHRISTENSON stands,
murmuring to NELSON CHANEY and WALTER AMUNDSEN, all
bundled up in winter coats. There are muttered "Hello,

Beale about you. He says you're
doing fine. Are you?

MAX
No.

DIANA
Are you keeping busy?

MAX
After a fashion. This is the
third funeral I've been to in two
weeks. I have two other friends
in hospital whom I visit regularly.
I've been to a couple of christenings.
All my friends seem to be dying or
having grandchildren.

DIANA
You should be a grandfather about
now. You have a pregnant daughter
in Seattle, don't you?

MAX
Any day now. My wife's out there
for the occasion. I've thought
many times of calling you.

DIANA
I wish you had.

They both suddenly stop on Fifth Avenue between 65th
and 64th Streets and. regard each other. An occasional
snowflake moistens their cheeks, wets their hair.

DIANA
I bumped into Sybil the Soothsayer
in the elevator last week. I said:
"You know, Sybil, about four months
ago, you predicted I would get
involved with a middle-aged man,
and, so far, all that's happened
is one many-splendored night. I
don't call that getting involved."
And she said: "Don't worry. You
will." It was a many-splendored
night, wasn't it, Max?

MAX
Yes, it was.

DIANA
Are we going to get involved, Max?

 
   

101

 

MAX
Yes. I need to get involved very
much. How about you?

DIANA
I've reached for the phone to call
you a hundred times, but I was sure
~- you hated me for my part in taking
your news show away.

MAX
I probably did. I don't know any
more. All I know is I can't keep
you out of my mind.

They stare at each other, bemused by the abrupt fragile
explosion of their feelings. The SNOW drifts down.
PEDESTRIANS move back and forth around them. The Fifth
Avenue TRAFFIC honks and grinds its way downtown.

 

DIANA

My God, she's uncanny.
MAX

who?
DIANA

Sybil the Soothsayer. We've got
a modern-day Greek drama here, Max.
Two star-crossed lovers ordained
to fall disastrously in love by
the gods. A December~-May story.
Happily married middle-aged man
meets desperately lonely young
career woman, let's say a violinist.
They both know their illicit love
can only end in tragedy, but they
are cursed by the gods and plunge
dementedly in love. For a few
brief moments, they are happy. He
abandons devoted wife and loving
children, and she throws away her
concert career. Their friends plead
~ with them to give each other up, but
they are helpless playthings in the
hands of malignant gods. Their love
sours, embittered by ugly little
jealousies, cryptic rancors. The
soothsayer appears again and warns
ar the girl she will die if she per-
$ sists in this heedless love affair.
She defies the soothsayer. But

to throw herself on the railroad
tracks. Give me a two-page outline
on it, Max. I might be able to
sell it to Xerox.

MAX
A bit too austere for teevee, I
think.

DIANA

You're right. We wouldn't get
an ll rating. How about a twist
on Brief Encounter? Happily
married man meets woman married
to her career.

MAX
NBC did Brief Encounter last year,
and it sank.

DIANA
Well, we're both a bit long in the
tooth to try for Romeo and Juliet.

She laughs, then he. A PASSERBY darts them a curious
glance.

after twenty-five years pf building
a home and raising a family and all
the senseless pain we've inflicted
on each other, I'll be damned if I'll
just stand here and let you tell me

(now it's she striding

around, weeping, a

caged lioness)
Because this isn't just some con-

is it? Or some broad you picked up
after three belts of booze. This
is your great winter romance, isn't

out, his own eyes wet and welling. After a moment,
he turns and regards his anguished wife.

He enfolds her; she sobs on his chest.

He struggles to restrain his tears. She releases her-
self from his embrace.

I think the best thing is if you
did move out. Does she love you,
Max?

MAX 4
I'm not sure she's capable of any :
real feelings. She's the television
generation. She learned life from
Bugs Bunny. The only reality she

tuxedo-ed,. and DIANA, evening-gowned, sit and stand

in the dark smallish room, cluttered with electronic
equipment, watching a replay of the Howard Beale show
on the big screen. TWO TECHNICIANS fiddle with their

* equipment --

HOWARD (ON SCREEN)
Now, listen to me, goddammit! The
Arabs are simply buying us! They're
buying all our land, our whole :
economy, the press, the factories,
financial institutions, the govern-
ment! They're going to own us!

even serene with despair.

Well, I'd like to see a type-

Prank, is it true?

HACKETT sighs. :

HACKETT

Yes. C.C. and A. has two billions ,
in loans with the Saudis, and they
hold every pledge we've got. We t
need that Saudi money bad.

White House report they were already

man, around the room)

picked golden boy, the heir apparent.
Now I'm a man without a corporation!

DIANA

back wall)

Let's get back to Howard Beale.
You're not seriously going to pull
Beale off the air.

HACKETT :
Mr. Jensen is unhappy with Howard
Beale and wants him discontinued.

DIANA
He may be unhappy, but he isn't
stupid enough to withdraw the number
one show on television out of pique.

HACKETT
(explodes)
Two billion dollars isn't pique!
That's the wrath of God! And the
wrath of God wants Howard Beale
fired!

DIANA
What for? Every other network
will grab him the minute he walks
out the door. He'll be back on
the air for ABC tomorrow. And
we'll lose twenty points in audience
share in the first week, roughly a
forty million loss in revenues for
the year.

UACKETT
I'm going to kill Howard Beale!
I'm going to impale the son of a
bitch with a sharp stick through
the heart!

DIANA
And let's not discount federal
action by the Justice Department.
If C.c. and A. pulls Beale off the
air as an act of retribution,
that's a flagrant violation of
network autonomy and an egregious
breach of the consent decree.

HACKETT
(beginning to like his
new train of thought)
I'll take out a contract on him.
I'll hire professional killers.
I'll do it myself. I'11 strangle
him with a sashcord.

. DIANA
No, I don't think Jensen is going
to fire anybody. He's sitting up
there in his office surrounded by
lawyers and senior vice presidents,
and right about now, they've begun
to realize the extraordinary impact
of television. That impact can be
focussed, manipulated, utilized.
If Howard Beale can hurt them, he
can help them.

The PHONE RINGS. A moment of anxious silence. HACKETT
picks it up --

HACKETT

(on phone)
Hackett -- Yes, Clarence, I've
already booked my flight ... Well,
can you give me a little more time
than that? I've got the red-eye
flight, I won't be back in New York
till six tomorrow morning ... That'll
be just fine. I'll see you then --

He returns the phone to its cradle, regards DIANA for
a moment.

HACKETT (Contd)
Mr. Jensen wants to meet Howard
Beale personally. He wants Mr. Beale
in his office at ten o'clock tomorrow
morning --

later, HOWARD BEALE, both dressed in banker's gray.

As they move for the building's entrance, HACKETT
herding HOWARD along, it becomes clear that HOWARD

is in a beatified state. His eyes glisten trans-

lungs:

This outburst doesn't seem to bother most. of the PEOPLE
passing by except for ONE or TWO who murmur: “Hey,

appall FRANK HACKETT, who stares in distress and en-

HOWARD. (ON MONITOR)
(sad, resigned, weary)

Last night, I got up here and
asked you people to stand up and
fight for your heritage, and you
did and it was beautiful. six
million telegrams were received
at the White House. The Arab
takeover of C.C. and A. has been
stopped. The people spcke, the
people won. It was a radiant
eruption of democracy. But I think
that was it, fellers. That sort
of thing isn't likely to happen
again. Because, in the bottom
of all our terrified souls, we
all know that democracy is a dying
giant, a sick, sick dying, decaying
political concept, writhing in its
final pain. I don't mean the United
States is finished as a world power.
The United States is the most
powerful, the richest, the most
advanced country in the world,
light-years ahead of any other
country. And I don't mean the
Communists are going to take over
the world. The Communists are
deader than we are. What's finished
is the idea that this great country
is dedicated to the freedom and
flourishing of every individual in
it. It's the individual that's
finished. It's the single, solitary
human being who's finished. It's
every single one of you out there
who's finished. Because this is no

Let's start looking around for

MAX sprawled on the soft chair. We notice that, in the
back of the living room, a bridge table has been set up
as a makeshift desk. It has a typewriter on it and a
welter of papers and books and filing folders. DIANA
appears in the bedroom doorway, regards MAX coldly --

DIANA
You know, you could help me out
with Howard if you wanted to.
He listens to you. You're his

sweeps crashing off the bridge table, sending the
welter of papers there flying off in a storm --

MAX (cont 'd)
-- and I'm tired of pretending to
write this dumb book about my
maverick days in those great early
years of television! Every execu-

another dumb book about the great |
goddamned early days of television!

DIANA
Terrific, Max, terrific. Maybe
you can start a whole new career
as an actor.

For a moment, it looks as if MAX is going to slug her.
Then he deflates --

MAX
It's the truth. After six months
of living with you, I'm turning
into one of your scripts. But this
isn't a script, Diana. There's
some real actual life going on here.

conscience-stricken and all those
things you think sentimental but
which my generation called simple
human decency. And I miss my home
because I'm beginning to get scared
shitless. It's all suddenly closer
to the end than to the beginning,
and death is suddenly a perceptible
thing to me, with definable features.
You've got a man going through primal
doubts, Diana, and you've got to
cope with it. Because I'm not some

the Barbara Walters show. I'm the

DIANA

me to do?

MAX :
I just want you to love me, Diana.
I just want you to love me, primal
doubts and all. You understand
that, don't you?

For one brief moment, you could almost believe she
does understand. She stares, eyes-locked with MAX,
her eyes threatening to well with tears. There are
certainly tears in 's eyes.

row immediately behind.

We're not going to find a replace-
ment for Howard Beale, so let's
stop kidding ourselves. Fully
fledged messiahs don't come in

Howard or we go without him. My
reports say we'll do better with-
out him. It would be disaster to
let this situation go on even
another week. By then, he'll be
down sixteen points and the trend
irreversible, if it isn't already.

INT: LIVING ROOM 164.

MAX has fallen asleep in one of the soft chairs. ‘The
newspaper he was reading has fallen to his lap. His
mouth is a bit agape and he wheezes a little. In the
stark lighting of the lamp behind the chair, he seems
suddenly an old man. DIANA stands and regards him
with perceptible distaste. She slips out of her
jacket, crosses to the bedroom.

INT: BEDROOM 165.

All the lights are on. DIANA, freshly scrubbed and
in a shower robe, is packing MAX's things. A large
valise lies opened on the bed, and DIANA is fetching
MAX's suits from the closet, folding them and packing
them away. MAX appears rumpled and in his shirt-
sleeves in the doorway behind her. She senses him
there, glances at him, continues with her packing.

DIANA
I think the time has come, Max,
to re-evaluate our relationship.

MAX
So I see.

DIANA
I don't like the way this script
of ours is turning out. This whole
thing started out as a comedy,
remember? Now, it's turning into
a seedy little drama. Middle-aged
man leaves wife and family for young
heartless woman, goes to pot. The
Blue Angel with Marlene Dietrich
and Emil Jannings. I don't like it.

 
138

MAX
So you've decided to cancel the
show.

DIANA
Right.

MAX
Listen, I'll do that.

He moves to the bed to take over the packing. She sits
in one of the bedroom chairs.

DIANA
The simple fact is you're a family
man, Max. You like a home and kids,
and that's beautiful. But I'm
incapable of any such commitment.
All you'll get from me is another
couple of months of intermittent
sex and recriminate and ugly little
scenes like the one we had last
night. I'm sorry for all those
vicious things I said to you last
night. You're not the worst fuck
I've ever had. . Believe me, I've
had worse. And you don't puff and
snorkle and make death-like rattles.
As a matter of fact, you're rather
serene in the sack.

MAX, who had gone into the bathroom for his toilet
articles, comes out with them, stands, regards DIANA.

MAX
Why do women always think the
most savage thing they can say
to a man is to impugn his cocks-

manship?

DIANA
I'm sorry I impugned your cocks-
manship.

MAX

I stopped comparing genitals back
in the schoolyard.

I always have, always will. I'm
more concerned about you. Once
I go, you'll be back in the eye
of your own desolate terrors.
Fifty dollar studs and the
nightly sleepless contemplation

pulls herself together. She moves out of the kitchen

A solemn FRANK HACKETT in blue suit walks down the long,
empty, hushed corridor to the large double doors of his

At the doors, NELSON CHANEY is waiting for him.

HACKETT sits behind his desk. ‘The others all find
places around the room.

Mr.. Jensen was. unhappy at the

idea of taking Howard Beale off

Beale is bringing a very important
message to the American people, s0
he wants Howard Beale on the

air. And he wants him kept on.

Nobody has anything to say to this.

catastrophic in our thinking. I
argued that television was a vola-
tile industry in which success and
failure were determined week by

HACKETT (Contd)
week. Mr. Jensen said he did not
like volatile industries and suggested
with a certain sinister silkiness
that volatility in business usually
reflected bad management. He didn't
really care if Howard Beale was
the number one show in television
or the fiftieth. He didn't really
care if the Beale Show lost money.
The network should be stabilized so
that it can carry a losing show and
still maintain an overall profit.
Mr. Jensen has an important message
he wants conveyed to the American
people, and Howard Beale is conveying
it. He wants Howard Beale on the
air, and he wants him kept on.
I would describe his position on
this as inflexible. Where does
that put us, Diana?

DIANA

(taking papers out

of her attache case)
That puts us in the shithouse,
that's where that puts us.

(holds up her

sheaf of papers) .
Do you want me to go through this?

HACKETT
Yes.

DIANA
I have an advance TVQ report here.
The Beale show Q score, which was
forty-seven in the May book, is down
to thirty-three and falling. Most
of this loss occurred in the child
and teen and eighteen-thirty-four
categories, which were our core
markets. NBC Nightly News, by
contrast, has gone up to a twenty-
nine Q, and, at this rate, will
pass us by the end of July. Every-
body here knows the Neilsen and
share-trend scores. Let me just
capsulate our own AR demographic
reports which have been extensive.
It is the AR department's carefully
considered judgment -- and mine --
that if we get rid of Beale, we

should be able to maintain a
very respectable share in the
high twenties, possibly thirty,
with a comparable Q level. The
other segments on the Beale show
-~- Sybil the Soothsayer, Jim
Webbing, the Vox Populi -- have
all developed their own audiences.
Our AR reports show without
exception that it is Howard Beale
that's the destructive force here.
Minimally, we are talking about
a ten point differential in
shares. I think Joe ought to
spell it out for us. Joe?

DONNELLY
A twenty-eight share is eighty-
thousand dollar minutes, and I
think we could sell complete
positions on the whole. As a
matter of fact, we're just getting
into the pre-Christmas gift-sellers,
and I'll tell you the agencies are
coming back to me with four dollar
CPMs. If that's any indication,
we're talking forty, forty-five
millidn dollar loss in annual
revenues.

THACKERAY

are watching the network news programs on CBS, NBC,
ABC and UBS-TV. The AUDIO is ON: headshots of
WALTER CRONKITE, JOHN CHANCELLOR, HOWARD K. SMITH,
HARRY REASONER, and JACK SNOWDEN, substituting for
HOWARD BEALE, interspersed with tapes of the horrible
happening at UBS the day before, flit and flicker
across the four television screens. Television
continues relentlessly on.

NARRATOR (OVER)
This was the story of Howard Beale
who was .the network news anchorman
on UBS-TV, the first known instance
of a man being killed because he
had lousy ratings.
