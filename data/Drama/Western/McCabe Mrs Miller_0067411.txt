OTHE PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH WAGER"

The town of Presbyterien Church was

born in the early 1890's. It was never
conceived, it just hsppened...John pudgy’
McCabe came to Presbyterian Church in 1595,
He died there in 1897 and the town died
three years later...

FADE IN:
ESTABLISHING SHOT PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH 1970 DAY
BEGIN TITLES

THE SITE of what was once Presbyterian Church. ANGLE FAVORS
‘the blackened ruins of the edifice from which the primitive
zinc mining mountain town took its name; a small, at its
best crude church, which st some previous point in history
was burned to the ground. We see the charred remains. An
entire wall is miraculously intact. CAMERA RISES to peek
over the top of the well and sees s green mountain vista

as far as the eye cen see. CAMERA BEGINS TO PAN AROUND.

It 1s raining and there is an eura of bitter cold. CAMERA
continues it's PAN. Below the church, other buildings,
crumbled and sagging sre suggested, but not identified.
There is NO SOUND. Presbyterian Church has died and time
hes all but buried it.

CAMERA RETURNS TO ORIGINAL POSITION

The town is alive - or rather struggling to survive.

The church is as it was at a time when it was under
construction. A tiny, rude community sprawls slong a
muddy street below the church. It is the town of Presby-
terlan Church, 1895, WE SEE the kneeling figure of a
man dressed against the foul, bitter cold sleet. The
weather has survived the seventy-five yeer transition.
The man wears 9 carpenter's apron over his hard clothing.
He is MISTER ELLIOTT, self~proclaimed minister of
Presbyterian Church end, in fact, the builder of the
church from which the town took it: name. It is still

to a ladder and continues to work on the church. CAMERA
MOVES UP HOLDING THE CHURCH STEEPLE AND BELLTOWER IN F.G.

ANOTHER ANGLE PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH

For a closer look. Calling Presbyterian Church a community
is giving it all the best of it. There are a few ramshackle
wooden structures on stilts, but the town consists mostly
of tents and has been hurriedly throm up along ea main
street which is little more than a muddy bog.

There are some mine entrances fronting the main street,

but they no longer produce ore and have been converted
into primitive dwellings of a sort. A crude aign over

the entrance to one of these abandoned mines reads:
SHEEHAN'S SALOON AND HOTEL. NO UNESCORTED WHORES ALLOWED.’

ANOTHER ANGLE “SEEEHAN'S"

As PAT SHEEHAN himself moves out of the former mine shaft and
throws a bucket of God-knows-what out onto the muddy street,
nearly drenching a couple of CHINAMEN who are Picking their
way from dry spot to dry spot. The Chinamen register their
complaints, but Sheehan pays no attention -- as though
dumping garbage on Chinamen was a way of life. Sheehan is
filthy and unshaven -- a dirty black Irishman with a dirty
black temper to match, He turns ‘and re-enters his saloon,
"Sheehan's," in fact, actually sums up the amount of growth
Presbyterian Church has so far experienced. It began within
the mine shaft, the next addition had been a wooden room

‘used as a bar room, Additional Space for living quarters

has now been provided by a tent off to one side,

ANOTHER ANGLE

FAVORING the Chinese as they move along the street toward
the edge of town and the mines in the b.g. In the b.g. the
church dominates the landscape, its steeple rising perhaps
sixty feet in the air, The SOUNDS of Elliott's carpentering
can be heard.

EXT. MOUNTAIN TRAIL : DAY

This is the trail leading to Presbyterian Church. We are in
hard-rock mining country. 4 man on horseback, leading = pack

horse, moves slowly up the trail and stops to gaze at the
church steeple. — .

ANOTHER ANGLE THE MAN

He is JOHN QUINCY McCABE. His {s not the face of a miner,
nor any man used to this wilderness, He wears a long, heavy,
all-purpose coat against the weather. A blanket protects
his head against the sleet. His face has not been browned
and leathered by the elements, and he seems oddly out of
Place in this rough mining country.

WHAT McCABE SEES
Presbyterian Church.

BACK TO McCABE .

as he surveys the town, his expression hiding and, at the
same time, reflecting his thoughts about it. If he has any.
He sighs in a kind of resignation, his breath showing in the
cold as he dismeunts.

ANOTHER ANGLE McCABE

The rump of the pack animal is in the f.g. as McCabe moves
in and begins to search for some articles in his pack, The
horse chooses this moment to relieve his bowels, perhaps as
an opinion of the muddy trail, the rank weather and the ;
filthy, town. McCabe removes his coat and takes off the
blanket from around his head. We see that beneath them he
wears a frock’coat, ruffled shirt and a fancy embroidered

‘ vest with a gold watch chain strung from pocket to pocket.

An impressive hand gun, a Navy Colt with an enormous barrei,
is holstered at his side, He has removed his "case" set of
soliaer and cuffs and begins putting them on. It is far too
sold for this outfit, but 1% is apparent McCabe wants this
facade. He takes his derby from his pack, shudders and
pats himself against the bitter sold, his breath issuing
virtual billows of steam. He mounts, puts on the desby

aS a rakish angle, and urges his horse to move out, securing
his coilar and his cuffs as he moves up the trail toward
Presbyterian Church.

ANOTHER ANGLE

A continuation. McCabe rides past the church as Flliott
ateps out, engaged in some task. He tips his hat, but
Fllictt ignores + He continues down into town. Except
for the inhospitable Elliott, the town seems deserted.
Though McCabe is miserable and cold, he shows an almost
Jaunty facade ~- the imperturbable gambler, in spades.

ANOTHER ANGLE

As McCabe rides onto the muddy main street. As he passes
“Sheehan's,” the proprietor steps out onto the porch. Ig-
noring him, McCabe rides past the saloon.

SHEEHAN :
Ain't nothing up there but hard-
rock miners. This here's the
only saloon. -

McCabe continues on. Sheehan calls after him.

SHEEHAN:
Trail don't lead nowhere but
right back down here.

McCabe rides on.

ANOTHER ANGLE McCABE

as he continues along the all-but-impassable street. A
CORNISH WATER WHEEL appears in the f.g., its suspended
sluice leading to a small stream nearby. The wheel is still,

WIDE ANGLE

as McCabe continues around the rough circular trail which,

IN THIS ANGLE, we can see does indeed lead back to the main
street. Gaping holes in the side of the mountain face out
along the trail. These are the entrances to the mines now
being worked. As McCabe parades Past, miners cvegin to appear
from within the mines and watch him. Some are Chinese, most
are Occidental, but it is hard to tell one from the other
since they are covered with pale gray zinc dust. INTERCUT.

INT. MINE TUNNEL

By the light of several lanterns inside, McCabe sees the
brawny back of a miner, the zinc dust caked with sweat on
his shirt, as he swings a twelve-pound Sledge. Another
miner holds a steel bit against the rough face of the tunnel.
The tlow of the sledge goes slightly off, and the bit is
flung to one side. :

John Quincy McCabe, the pied piper, rides back around onto
the town's muddy street, the crowd of miners growing behind
him. Spotting an opportunity for a little afternoon
business, Sheehan moves into the saloon. McCabe reins in .
and ties his horse to a crooked log hitching post. A slight
smile plays on his lips -- he has led the group of miners
back to "Sheehan's." :

Trapped by McCabe's matter-of-fact attitude, Sheehan helps

McCabe beams his thanks, sits quickly, takes out an unopened
deck of cards, shows the seal around before earefully
breaking it, and expertly spreads the cards on the blankes.
The entire group has now gathered around the table in
anticipation. McCabe folds his arms in front of him and
waits. No one speaks. He graces each of the four seated
miners with a smile.

Just in time to see Tiny take a roundhouse swing at Kelly and
Ledbetter, missing them both. The force of his swing propels
him into the tent, knocking it down, Kelly and Ledbetter
jump on top of Tiny and more of the tent begins to fall.
From inside comes the SCREAMS of the whores and the SOUNDS of
at least three angry men whose pleasure has been interrupted,

It catches on like s forest fire and soon the entire line of

they, too, join in the melee,

The weather is bad, Although it's mid-morning, only ea few
people can be seen on the street -- and these soon duck into
the protection of buildings, the windows of which are clouded
with steam, Soon a CARRIAGE comes into view and moves down
the street TOWARD CAMERA, Although we can't as yet distin-
guish them, the occupants of the carriage are the FOUR WHORES
for whom the town is weiting, The carriage is loaded with
their belongings, and the ladies themselves are heavily
clothed against the weather and appear as little more than
lumps, Across the muddy street a CHINAMAN makes an exit
from a buiiding and moves into SHOT about the same time the
carriage comes to a stop near CAMERA,

And a closer look at the occupants, A DRIVER, EUNICE,
BLANCHE, CINDY and MAI LING, Oddly enough, these girls do
not look much different from other girls of the same age,
which ranges from about twenty to thirty, They are not
garishly made up, nor costumed, They are tired and irritable
after a long trip,

A waiting room has been formed by dropping a flap which

INT. McCABE'S SALOON NIGHT

The saloon has been completed now, but the only occupants of
it are McCabe, a BARTENDER, DANNY, and a CHINESE WAITER,
known as HEY YOU. McCabe, a bottle of whiskey at his elbow,
is seated at a faro table, a number of books of the ledger
type are open in front of him. His movements and gestures,
even the way he tosses off an occasional drink, indicate that
columns of figures, credits and debits are not his long suit.
Danny is behind the bar, hard pressed to find something to
do, and Hey You is standing idly near to him.

DANNY:
Be all right to close up, Mr.
McCabe?

McCabe looks up from his books, surveys the empty saloon.

McCABE:
Yeah, close up for crissakes.
It's going to take me all night
to figure where I am at with
these Goddamn books,

Danny slips off his apron and moves toward the door.

McCABE:
Come on over and have a drink.

DANNY:
If it's all the same to you, Mr.
McCabe, I thought I'd get myself
a bath,

"Cleanliness is next to Godliness.”

McCABE:
Cleanliness is next to the whorehouse.
Go ahead. -- You too, Hey You. I'll

‘CONSTANCE:
Why are you always in such a bad
temper? .

McCabe closes and locks the inside door of the saloon,

MeCABE:
Por one thing, it is because ever
since you came here you have cost
me nothing but money -- This shit
must cease, Madame. I have not
sold a full bottle of whiskey today,
and that's a fact,

CONSTANCE:
Because every man in town was taking
a bath in your bath house or laying
up with a girl in your whorehouse,

. McCABE:
But I have not seen any of that
money, Madame, and my books show
that what I need most of all right
now is money. :

She spots the books, moves to the table and sets down the
strongbox.

We missed a lot of bath money
because of the rush, but there's
almost three hundred dollars there.

McCabe continues to count out loud, makes a mistake, starts
over with an impatient glance at Mrs. Miller, She pours
herself « drink, then looks at the open books. At first it
is cursory, then she peruses them with growing interest,
which soon turns to emusement.

CONSTANCE:
(continuing)
How could you tell?

McCabe stops counting, exasperated,

McCABE:
How could I tell what?

CONSTANCE:
You said your books showed you need
money. I'd like to know how you
figured that, because these books
are impossible,

McCABE:
I'll thank you to keep out of things
you don't understand.

CONSTANCE:
We're partners. I have a right to
see the books,

McCABE:
We are not partners in my saloon or
my gambling or my opium business.

CONSTANCE:

I am_going to pack up and go to
San Francisco. I'm going to sell
you my half-interest and I'm going

you can count. I can figure odds
and pay-offs before you can blink,
and I can tell you how much the
bartenders are stealing by looking

Stars and Stripes around his waist, and en equally large
Canadian in red tights. Everyone we have met, including the
Chinese and all the whores, new and old, can be seen. Only
Pat Sheehan is not in evidence. McCabe stands nearby

including Lily.

of the match itself, INTERCUTS of the crowd, as the two
giants wrestle each other, break down the ropes, fall into
the crowd and wind up using half the town to complete the
match, The delighted crowd follows along with them. Tiny
is the eventual loser, as the Canadian nearly drowns him
in the dirty pond, which the rains have left in front of
"Sheehan's. Across it, Sheehan moves out onto the front
Porch of his saloon and watches the action, before turning
back inside,

ANGLE ON LILY

Very upset at the outcome of the match. She rushes to the
side of the half-drowned Tiny and helps him to his feet,
unmindful of the water which drips on her. They walk away,
Lily doing most of the supporting.

‘The shadows are longer and the main event, a tug-of-war to be
staged on the main street and involving damn near every man
in town, is about ready. McCabe is somewhere in the f.g.,
his Colt drawn to signify the start. He carries a bottle
of whiskey in his other hand. He is swaying drunkenly, but
obviously having the time of nis life.

Drinks on me for the winners, and

the losers have to spend the night

in Sheehan's Hotel.

before throwing it into the street, and climhs the steps
leading to the porch of his saloon. The MAN we saw earlier
at "Sheehan's" can be seen near the entrance, an amused,
supercilious expression on his face. As McCabe sways to

the door, he hands him a card. McCabe @lances at it, without
seeing, and hands it back.

MAN:
My name is Sears, Eugene Sears.

McCabe tries to focus, He sticks out his hand in the
general direction of Sears.

McCABE:
I'm Roebuck -- who the hell is
watching the store?

Sears smiles, lips only.

We'd like to have a little talk
with you, McCabe. :

McCabe looks at him closely, decides he Probably doesn'+
like Sears, and moves into the saloon as Sears tries to
complete the handshake.

McCabe moves directly behind the bar, which has neither
bartender nor customers, to get another bottle. Sears

The tug-of-war is a dead heat. There has been plenty of
slipping and sliding, but most everyone is in the seme place

INT. MAS. MILLER'S WHOREHOUSE NIGHT

A wild, bewdy party is in progress. This is the first time
we have been insides Mrs. Miller's "house," and while it is
furnished and has a piano and ea few carpets, it is hardly
a grand,. exotic escape from the dreary everyday life of
Presbyterian Church. By comparison it may seem so to the
miners, long accustomed to really hard living, but luxurious
it ain't. All the girls are here, most of the men except
the Chinese, Sheehan, and most notably, John McCabe,
Constance Miller walks through her crowded “house,” enter-
taining, patting, dodging serious passes, keeping order.
From time to time one of the girls lugs a trick upstairs,
but tonicht at any rate, Mrs, Miller is rminning a loose
ship. Eventually she heads into the kitchen.

INT. KITCHEN

At the kitehen table Lily sits with Tiny. They are holding
hands, smiling, enamored with one another. With a slight
smile, Mrs. Miller crosses directly to the window and peers
out. :

Across the ditch, the rear of McCabe's saloon can be seen,
In contrast with the revelry at Mrs. Miller's, McCabe's
saloon seems quiet.

somehow, and puzzled.

and several doors, Mrs. Miller heads for one of the rooms
located at the end of the hall, A door opens and a man
enters the hall from one of the bedrooms. His eyes light up
and he makes a grab for Mrs. Miller, who ducks away and
continues, The man starts to follow.

CONSTANCE:
Get away from ms, you son-of-a-
bitch or I'll make a soprano out
of you!

The man reaches uncontrollably to protect his groin area
as Mrs. Miller slips into her bedroom.

INT. BEDROOM

A large room by present standards, impersonally furnished,
There is a closet door and another which leads to a flight
of outside stairs. Mrs, Miller opens the outside door and
takes another long look at McCabe's saloon. She turns away,
slamming the door, growing angry -- and angry with herself
for growing angry. Now she moves to the closet door, takes
a@ hat box down rrom the shelf and moves to the bed. She
opens the box, removes a feathered hat, which conceals a
Peover of opium and the paraphernalia with which to smoke it,
We should get the feeling that she handles the whole thing
with considerable expertise.

Constance turns down the light and moves to the door to
listen as the footsteps reach the top of the outside stairs,
Now there is NO SOUND at all -- and when the silence grows

McCabe and Butler size each other. up while Kid brings the
bottle and two glasses, pouring Breed's drink first, When
he pours for Butler, the old killer takes the bottle from
him. Kid returns to the bar es before.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Butler swallows his glass of whiskey all at once, pours
another, and takes a step nearer McCabe to set the bottle
on the Faro table. McCabe brings his shotgun up sharply --
to Butler's further amusement.

McCABE:
You don't have no notion that the
second drink's on credit, do you?

BUTLER:
How many man have you killed, Pudgy?

McCABE:
Counting Roundtree?
BUTLER:
Yeah.

testing McCabe, and when he tenses, Butler pulls the chair
back and ‘sits in it heavily.

NEW ANGLE FAVOR BUTLER
He blows cigar smoke in the air and begins to recite.

BUTLER:
Let me see, now, Pudgy McCabe.
You still carry that trick

McCabe says nothing.

BUTLER:

No. -- You probably gave that up.
How about your handkerchief or

McCabe merely smiles.

Oh, that's right Pudgy. You got
that special Colt in that special
holster, ain't that right?

You got your money on the right card.

Why, I wait until one of them prairie

splatter that head all over the prairie.
I waited a whole afternoon once.

Butler laughs, rewarding Breed with his approval. The Kid
is unsure whether to laugh or not.

Butler laughs again, pours another drink, tosses it off and
sets down the glass. .

BUTLER:
We ain't paying for these drinks,
Pudgy..

He moves away again toward the bar, past the Kid, who steps
out between Sutler and McCabe. McCabe moves oulekly away
from the table to ean Qngle where Butler can't escape the

The Kid stands uncertain, ready to draw if Butler gives the
word, yet knowing he'll be dead when he does. Breed, out
of the limelight, stoops slightly trying to reach his boot.

Don't try it.

SHEEHAN :

You told me there wasn't going to
be no fight today.

BUTLER:
Maybe we changed our minds.
Butler moves further to one side of the Kid. Apparently
it will all be over at any moment. The Kid moves a bit,

drawing the shotgun toward him. Over the bar a sign reads:
"GENTLEMEN WILL NOT SPIT ON THE FLOOR; OTHERS MUST NOT."

. KID:
I just spit on your floor.

Showdown!

_ McCabe moves his shotgun off the Kid and points it directly

at Butler,

McCABE:
If this young man hawks up another,
I'm going to give you a new asshole.

Butler thinks about it briefly before he moves over and puts
his arm around the kid.

BUTLER:
That rifle of mine shoots eight
hundred yards, Kid, Let McCabe
think about that for awhile, --
Then we'll kill him,

He moves his head and Breed responds immediately, heading
for the door. Butler and the Eld follow. The Kid goes out

WIDE ANGLE

The two miners have reached a spot just about parallel with
"McCabe's." TWO GUNSHOTS are fired by Butler, neatly picking
off the miners' hats. The shots have caused one of the
mounts to rear, tossing one of the miners to the ground.

The other miner immediately wheels his horse around and rides
out leaving his companion in the street. He hears them
laughing down at "Sheehan's" and realizing that it's just a
prank, moves to pick up the hats, They have fallen near one
another in the street. But es the miner reaches to retrieve
it, TWO MORE GUNSHOTS ring out sending the hats skittering
away out of reach.

McCabe stands looking out the door, he hasn't shaved, nor
has he dressed with his usual-care. Danny rises from behind

EXT, SHEEHAN'S SALOON DAY

Butler and Breed are seated on the front porch of the
Baloon. Kid stands on the other side of the pond, some
cans and bottles on the ground beside him. Breed has a
shotgun and Butler his long Sharps. The Kid throws a bottle
up-.in -the air, draws with his right hand, and smashes the
bottle in mid-air, .

Several small boys and a few men are watching from the
livery stable, very much impressed with Kid.

Now he picks up a can, throwing it up in the air, drawing
and hitting it as before except that this time his bullet
has sent the can soaring higher. In the b.g. Breed sees
the can in mid-air, whips the shotgun up and sends it
even higher -- only to be topped by Butler who hits the
can squarely with a bullet from his Sharps sending it
higher still. And the procedure is repeated.

Finally he moves to the stairway, but stops just short of
stepping up to move around on the ground and check the STEP

Elliott's church is nothing more than a shell, a facade.
There ts no floor, no pews, no pulpit. Absolutely barren,
except for a- ladder. The ground has not even been cleared,
Stumps and boulders are still there and in one corner a
messy area can. be seen where Elliott sleeps. McCabe moves
to the ladder and looks up.

P.0.V, McCAEESS —
The ladder leads to the bell tower.

BACK TO SCENE

If McCabe has thoughts about Elliott's church, they will have
to be examined later. He starta to climb the ladder, but

finds it impossible to negotiate carrying the cumbersome shot-
gun. He leans it against the bottom of the ladder and climbs,

The highest point in the town: of Presbyterian Church. From
here, McCabe can see the town as he has never before seen it,

P.0.V¥.:McCABE'S WHAT KE SEES

His saloon and the other buildings along Main Street are
facing him. Across from them, the abandoned mines, the
government building at the far end. "Sheehan's" saloon can.
be seen across the pond at one end of Main Street, Following
along the back street up from "Sheehan's" he sees the livery
stable, a few dwellings and shops, the rear of Mrs. Miller's
"house" separated from "McCabe's" by the ditch. The bath
house, the mines beyond it, and the shacks of the Chinese

“section down the slope. There is no movement of any kind,

Without a word, Breed steps to the center of the room and
fires his SHOTGUN into the mirror, destroying tt. Kid,

He's too high up to hear, but Butler's gestures make it plain
that they are splitting the town up between them for the
search. Butler and Breed leave Kid on Main Street and walk
across the bridge, splitting up on the other side of it.
Breed will begin his search at Mrs. Miller's, and that whole
street, and Butler apparently will begin his in the Chinese
section.

McCabe crouches down feeling the dirt floor to see if it has
fallen, He can't find it. His face clouds, expression
puzzled. He rises, CAMERA MOVING WITH.HIM. As McCabe turns
away from the ladder, ANGLE WIDENS TO REVEAL the SHOTGUN,
held by someone unseen. It is pointed directly into McCabe's
face, about three inches away, McCabe cannot tear bis eyes
from the yawning holes of the double-barrelied abotgun.

against the wall.

and exits quickly.

EXT. CHURCH

McCabe allows himself a moment of great relief, but only a
moment. His slicker makes too much noise now that the rain
has diminished some. He shucks it off, moves to the corner
of the church and takes his gun from his holster, He looks
at it for a beat; the hand gun is all he has,

WIDE ANGLE

toward Kid, whose back is to McCabe as he stands peering
between two buildings, having moved only scant yards from

Tt is the SOUND of the guns being cocked that helps McCabe
make up his mind to try and cross behind him,

WITH KID

Standing still now, watching, cocking and re-cocking, tensed
to spin around at the slightest sound. Behind him, McCabe
runs from the cover of the bridge, trying to cover the SOUND
of the mid sucking at his boots by timing his steps to the
SOUND of the Kid's fiddling with his guns. When McCabe takes
one too many steps and the SOUND of the mid sucking after his
bocts is startling, Kid hears it. He cocks both his guns,
but there's a moment when the Kid is afraid to turn around --
and afraid not to.

McCabe has his gun out at arm's length in front of him. When
he cocks it, the SOUND triggers Kid into spinning around,
