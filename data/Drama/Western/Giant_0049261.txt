Sitting on a rock, surveying ‘the house, the windmill, the

the pride of aman who is now more than just a man; he is

‘the sum of a man and his possessions, Jett seems more

_ interested in the quiet earth beneath him than he is in the

creaking windmill above, His look is fixed on the barren
ground, What he sees is of great importance to him, ~~
perhaps green crops bursting from the earth -~ perhaps @
fence and paint and improvements -- perhaps He is looking

far below the surface, where water lies to meke this trens-
formation possible, Jett is a man of intuition, of keen
instinct, Perhaps he penetrates below the water, ~~ perhaps
he senses the ocean of oil thet lies beneath. The strange
sense of triumph that the ORCHESTRA CONVEYS leads the audience
to sense some of this. , .
