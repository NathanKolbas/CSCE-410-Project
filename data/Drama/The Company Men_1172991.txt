BOBBY (VO)
..-It's all about earnings...

And a resounding THWACK! Then suddenly, brilliant sunlight
as a small white ball sails off into a beautiful blue, early
September, sky.

THE COUNTRY CLUB - MORNING 3

Three men watch unhappily as it flies perfectly toward a
distant green. Bobby's up on the tee, watching his shot.

BOBBY
Watch your earnings and the fundamentals
will take care of themselves.
MIFFLIN whistles admiringly as the ball drops onto the green.

CARLSON
..-bastard...

CONNERS
Rumor is GTX has to show more movement or
Morgan's going to issue a sell.

BOBBY
How many are you over now Steve, seven?

Bobby knows exactly how many. Carlson flips him off. Steps
up to the tee, sets his ball.

CONNERS
Salinger have a plan to prop up the
bottom line over there, Bobby?

BOBBY
You moonlighting for the SEC now, Matt?

CONNERS
Casual conversation.

BOBBY
What do you think counselor?

MIFFLIN
Hell yes, what's a little insider trading

Carlson SMACKS a strong drive. Not as nice as Bobby's but:

INT. CHICAGO HYATT REGENCY MEETING ROOM ~ DAY 4

We're GLIDING ABOVE an elegant silver coffee service, trays
of cut fruit, bagels. Men and women in business attire take
notes at linen covered banquet tables, nurse coffees.

STEVENS (VO)
...we've reviewed our pipeline of some
500 projects and programs...

The CAMERA MOVES ALONG the dais, placards set in front of the
slightly bored panel participants, behind them a banner and
corporate logo announce: GTX Global Transportation Systems.

STEVENS (cont'd)
..-focusing on those with significant
marketing opportunities and jettisoning
everything that won't contribute
immediately to our profitability...

The CAMERA APPROACHES a man in his sixties, STEVENS, droning
on. WE DON'T SLOW, continue along the row of exec faces.

STEVENS (cont'd)
Selecting thirty-seven as promising
strategic growth programs and setting
aside the rest for future consideration.

Until we finally ARRIVE at the placard in front of a bored --

Eugene McClary
Executive Vice-President - Transportation Systems

Doodling an elaborate geometric design on a hotel note pad.
As Stevens finishes, several analysts raise their hands.

HASPEL
Ned Haspel, JP Morgan. Mr. McClary, you
were talking earlier about fiscal 2011,
you've done a good job of convincing us
that with the credit markets frozen, your
sales revenue in 2010 will slow --

GENE
Great, then my job here is done.

That gets a laugh from the analysts.

HASPEL
Can you talk about 2011 and what sort of
a percentage increase you anticipate?

GENE
People love to talk about percentages
Ned, our people do, you people do. But
when we do sales forecasts in a mature
manufacturing sector like transportation,
we should be focusing on how to maintain
growth in absolute dollars.

HASPEL
Are you suggesting you aren't expecting
any growth in your division next year?

Stevens looks down the dais at Gene, worried.

GENE
I'm suggesting that we face increased
foreign competition and a difficult
market for large capital expenditures
like shipbuilding, so 2011 will probably
end even or a little up from 2010. I
call that an excellent result in this
credit climate but you're probably going
to call it disappointing.

Stevens looks quickly for another hand.

STEVENS
Another question?

HASPEL
So no growth in 2011?

Gene avoids Stevens concerned look, stares down Haspel for a
long moment, then goes back to the company script.

GENE
I'm confident that while shipbuilding
will remain challenged, the rest of the
Transportation Systems Group will
continue to contribute significant growth
to GTX in coming quarters.

Haspel's still unsatisfied but Gene points to another hand.

GENE (cont'd)
Yes, in the back.

GTX CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS - PARKING LOT - DAY
A glass and metal cathedral of commerce. Acres of unfettered
capitalism surrounded by manicured lawns and parking lots.
Bobby pulls his Porsche into his spot.
Hits his alarm, VOOP! The lot is a lesson in corporate
automotive hierarchy; Volvos, Hondas and Excursions give way
to BMWs, Range Rovers and Jaguars nearer the door.

CUT TO:

mature elms rustle in the artificial breeze, granite floors

DING! He steps off the elevator, pushes through glass doors

Secretarial desks, rows of cubicles for the worker bees,
heads for a windowed office and his secretary, CAROL.

BOBBY
Any messages?

He doesn't wait, grabs them off her desk. She's a little
distant. He doesn't notice, shuffles through them.

CAROL
Wilcox wants to see you, she's in the
fifth floor conference room.

BOBBY

He doesn't. wait for an answer, heads off down the row of

GLASS WALLED CONFERENCE ROOM 9

Eight young execs in mid-meeting, LAKE, JANE. Bobby heads
for a chair, peeling off his suit-jacket.

BOBBY

Anybody want to guess what I shot at the

club this morning?

They're all staring at him, it's uncomfortable.

BOBBY (cont'd)

44 on the front, 42 on the back.

What's up, somebody die?

Dead silence. Bobby takes a beat, looks through the glass
wall out to the people staring in from the hallway.

cur TO:
HALLWAY 10

Bobby FLINGS open the door, passes frightened faces staring
up at him. A secretary, BARBARA, stands by an office door.

BOBBY
Conal?

CONAL DOHERTY, sixties, packing a couple of boxes. A stunned
woman in her forties sits on Conal's sofa, DIANE LINDSTROM.

CONAL
They closed Mobile and Newport News,
merged Ship Systems into Rail Products.

BOBBY

Floor to ceiling glass with a lovely view of the rolling
Massachusetts hills and Boston beyond. Some art, a few
plants, and SALLY WILCOX, tailored, attractive.

BOBBY
What the hell is going on?

WILCOX
Bobby, you know Dick Landry from Legal?

A balding, average man sits at the small conference table.

LANDRY
The company's consolidating divisions.
Difficult decisions had to be made in
areas where redundancies surfaced.

Bobby stares at them, can't believe where this is going.

LANDRY (cont'd)
We've structured a generous severance
package for you. Your twelve years with
us entitles you to twelve weeks full pay
and benefits.

BOBBY
You're firing me?

He presents it as ludicrous on it's face, she doesn't laugh.

WILCOX
Come on Bobby, sit down.

LANDRY
We're also offering you outplacement
services to help you secure your next
employment.

The room's spinning, Bobby tries to get his bearings.

About my still having a job?

It never even occurred to him, he stares at her dumbly.

knickknacks. Men, women. Trunks open, car doors. Bobby

INT. PHIL'S BEDROOM 28

Wool wall-to-wall carpeting, dark colonial reproductions,
more family photos. Phil finds her passed out on top of the
comforter, fully clothed, shoes kicked off. An empty wine
glass on the end-table. He exhales, starts for the closet.

LORNA

He looks back to find her watching him groggily from the bed.

LORNA (cont'd)
Ann Doherty called, they fired Conal?

He nods, pulls off his coat, tie, hangs them in the closet.
She sits on the edge of the bed, trying to get her bearings.

LORNA (cont'd)
I tried your office, are we okay?

You're sure?

He hates it when she's like this. Forces a reassuring smile.

PHIL
Yeah, Gene spoke to Wilcox.

rises slowly, he pulls the car into it's spot in the
immaculate space. Climbs out, starts for the house.

Gene enters, drops his briefcase on the table in the large

Cut crystal tumblers, antiques and art. Finds the scotch,
takes a few ice cubes from the waiting ice bucket.

CYNTHIA (OS)

CYNTHIA McCLARY appears, fifties, hair already done, make-up,

Stares at the pickup trucks and minivans in the drive, the
boat in the yard.

He looks at his wife, do they have to go? Yes. She grabs a
gift, climbs out with the kids. Bobby follows reluctantly.

CUT TO:
JACK'S HOUSE - EARLY EVENING 32

A big plasma TV dominates the living room, blaring a Sox
game. Several men gathered around, watching. The kitchen
table groans under piles of chips, beer and pizzas still in
their delivery boxes.

MAGGIE
We won't stay long.

Promise? She follows the kids out into the back yard. Bobby
drifts to the kitchen, staring out the open sliding door onto
the rear deck.

JACK
How go the suit wars, Bobby?

JACK DOLAN, Maggie's brother, high school quarterback
handsome, with the broad, calloused hands and weathered face
of a man who works for a living. He's cutting the cellophane
off supermarket steaks and plates of brats -- plopping them
down on a platter in the tiny kitchen. Bobby hadn't seen him.

JACK (cont'd)
Move any more high-paying American jobs
offshore to Asian shitholes this week?

BOBBY
Been concentrating on union busting
lately, Jack.

Jack grins, this is an old routine with them. Stabs the
steaks with a carving fork to tenderize, then liberally salts
the meat, then douses them with Worchester sauce.

JACK
Surprised you could make it, no early
flight or golf game? Those are the usual
excuses, aren't they?

Back to your post barbecue boy.

Jack heads out with the meat. Diedre turns to Bobby.

DIEDRE (cont'd)
Get something to drink, Margaritas in the
blender, beer's in the cooler out back.

He watches her walk away, short skirt, long legs -- he's
right, she does looks great. A Diedre friend in the living
room catches him looking, smirks at him, turns back to the
woman she was talking with.

Bobby makes his way out onto --
THE DECK

Beers on ice in a gigantic cooler, working men and women
laughing, telling jokes. The picnic table groans under it's
load of paper plates and potluck.

Below, Jack hands off the meat to a man at the big Weber in
the yard (we'll come to know later as DAVEY) wades into a
pick-up football game with a pack of boys, including his own
three (14, 12 and 10) and their cousin, Drew.

Jack intercepts the ball from Drew, pretends to run, let's
the boys tackle him in the yard, pile on. All the boys are
laughing, nobody harder than Jack.

A Brooks Brothers suited handler leans in to Cynthia,

Salinger tries to look humble. It's a stretch.

GENE (cont'd)
No one wanted Gloucester Shipbuilders,
years of multi-million dollar losses, the
highest labor costs in the industry. But
from those humble beginnings, Jim grew
Gloucester into GTX, with over sixty
thousand employees and eleven billion
dollars in gross annual revenues.

That gets applause from this crowd.

I could go on and on, but we all want
Charlie to catch that game. So, it is my
great privilege to introduce my oldest
friend, my college roommate, the best man
at my wedding, the worst tennis player I
know, my boss, Jim Salinger.

Salinger makes his way to the podium, shakes Gene's hand.
Gene steps back into the shadows as Salinger basks in the

MAGGIE
We won't be able to make the mortgage

if we price the house low enough, we may
be able to get as much as four hundred.

BOBBY
Four hundred? That's less than we owe.
We'd loose everything we've got in it.

MAGGIE
It doesn't matter how much we've got in
it, your severance ends in three weeks.
We're going to end up in foreclosure.

They're not fighting, both are too tired, her head resting on
his outstretched arm.

BOBBY

We won't have anything to put down on

We can't qualify for a new house on just

ROXBURY - EARLY MORNING 97

A bright, blinding post-snow day. It's cold, a brisk wind
coming in off the Atlantic. Bobby parks his used Camry in
front of an old house. Climbs out. The house is a couple of
hundred years old, torn up. Stacks of lumber sit in the
yard, plastic sheeting covers the windows.

Makes his way slowly up the debris strewn drive, past the
dumpster and a Sam Gump, out onto the rock hard, frozen dirt
yard, toward the sound of SAWS and HAMMERS. A man comes from
the house, heading for a truck. Bobby's bother-in-law, Jack.

Jack, stares. Tool belt, old flannel shirt, beat-up down
vest. Bobby stops a few yards away from him. Clouds of hard
white mist escaping with every breath.

BOBBY
I need a job, Jack.

ROXBURY HOUSE - EARLY MORNING 98

Bobby pulls up at the curb, climbs out of his used Camry.

New work boots, thermal underwear top, heavy sweater, old ski
parka. Grabs a brand new leather tool belt off the passenger
seat. Hammer, tape measurer, screwdrivers.

Jack stands by his truck; two men beside him. Davey,
muscular, fifties, a lit Camel dangling from his mouth. And
MIKE, twenties, silent, hung-over. They watch Bobby trying
to get the heavy belt snapped around his waist.

ROXBURY HOUSE - MORNING 99 *

A huge pile of plywood sits in the yard. Bobby struggles to
pick up one of the awkward 4x8 sheets. It's difficult,
heavy. You have to get your right hand on one edge, slide it
across the pile and hump the weight up and over your head.

He staggers toward the house, huffing and grunting, blind on
one side because the sheet blocks his view. SLAMS into the
front door frame, staggers back, crouches to make it into --

ROXBURY HOUSE 100 *

It's skeletal, stripped down to old 2x4 true beams and
snaking ungrounded ceramic electrical lines. He looks up the
winding staircase to the hammering and tinny oldies radio
drifting down from the third floor above. Starts up the
bannister-less stairs with his unwieldy load.

Every step is torture, the machined plywood edges cut into
his hands, his muscles scream, the precarious drop to the
first floor increasingly terrifying with every step. To make
matters worse, he SLAMS the plywood on each landing as he
climbs. Each SLAM jarring teeth and bones, his head smashed
against the fresh cut ply. Finally arrives on --

THE THIRD FLOOR 101
Squats, dumps the plywood clumsily down with a flopping,

CLUNK. The floor's gone, Jack and Davey balanced out on the *
2x12s. “Hey Mr. Tambourine Man" BLARES from the plaster and *
paint splattered radio. *

Bobby leans against the wall, fighting for breath. Mike
scampers along the open beams, hauls Bobby's plywood across
to where Jack and Davey secure it with nail guns. *

tall pile of plywood. Staggers back, already exhausted.

Jack checks his watch. Sets down his nail gun, turns off the
compressor, straightens up, starts out. Davey and Mike
notice, set down their nail guns, start out after him.

Bobby watches them quizzically, where are they going? Mike
nods to Bobby as he passes.

A sea of old stud walls and the centuries old plank flooring.
The men sit around on nail boxes and stacks of 2x4s, eating
sandwiches and chips, drinking sodas, coffee and Red Bulls
plucked ‘from their battered lunch coolers. They're laughing.

A depressed Bobby sits off by himself, no lunch, picking at
his blistered and torn fingers, lunch-less. Jack picks
tomatoes off his sandwich, tossing them back in his cooler.

JACK
Fifteen years, she's still trying to get
me to eat tomatoes.

Davey watches Bobby, stands, comes over, sits. Leans in,
examines Bobby's brand new leather work gloves.

New. That's why you're getting blisters.

He digs an unbelievably old pair of gloves out of his back

Bobby leans back against the lathe, closes his eyes, wants to

Bobby nods. Heads for the waiting area. Orchids in a pot,
soft butternut suede sofas, new Architectural Digest and Wall

nervously through a Forbes. Too anxious to really focus.

Bobby steps back out onto the street. The sidewalk is busy
with business men and women, carrying briefcases, talking on
cell phones, checking Blackberries and Iphones, rushing for
meetings and sales presentations.

Towering office buildings rise up around him. Above the
buildings, a deep blue sky, clouds drifting past unnoticed.

Bobby stands there, the crowd parting, moving around him,
avoiding. A man lost, surrendering.

He stands there defeated for a long beat. Then reaches for
his tie, pulls it off, and walks away. Melting into the
anonymous, crowded sidewalks of a city at work.

Gene's driving, looking, nursing a 7-11 coffee. Takes a
right, pulls along a deserted side road. Slows. Ahead, a
car is pulled to the side of the road on an embankment.
Lights off, engine running, driver's side door open.

Phil's hunting in the tall grass of the gravel shoulder.
Dishevelled, coat laying in a heap on the car hood.

Gene walks toward him. Phil rears back, throws the rock he
just dug up in the direction of the glass office building at
the other side of the expansive parking lot below. The GTX
sign glows serenely from the upper corner of the top floor.

A beat. The rock CLATTERS harmlessly on the asphalt below,
miles away from doing any damage.

GENE
Lorna's pretty worried about you, has you
wrapped around a tree somewhere.

A pint bottle of Chivas stands lonely sentinel on Phil's car
hood. He finds another rock, turns it over in his hand,
weighing. Rears back, flings it with a mighty GRUNT...

PHIL
Sons of bitches...

His voice echoes in the small amphitheater formed by the
embankment as the rock SKITTERS across the parking lot below.

GENE
What're you doing?

Digs another rock out of the ground. Releases it with a
thundering GRUNT, slips in the gravel, almost falls.

PHIL
Motherfuckers...!

Gene watches the rock sail away into the night. Follows it's
arc with Phil. Closer, closer... it HITS the sidewalk in
front of the building, scoots harmlessly into the bushes.

GENE
Tom Brady couldn't hit that building from

Goes to the sink, takes the trash out from underneath.

He takes a deep, satisfying drag, sets the butt on the porch

the garage on the alley. Opens a lid, dumps the trash in.

Looks around. Steps to the garage's side door, opens it.
Steps inside. We stay outside, DRIFTING BACK INTO the yard.
Fluorescent lights BLINK on inside.

We watch him moving inside, silhouetted in the dirty glass of

Towering buildings of rusting steel and galvanized sheet

the white-capped Atlantic.

Tankers and cargo ships. Decommissioned destroyers and

through exotic waters. The ghosts of sailors lost and the
men who built these mighty ships whistle through the rusting
rigging and the deserted buildings.

Bobby parks in the alley beside the garage. Climbs out with
his tools, tired, dirty. Drew's ghosting | in the alley,

working on his jumper on Bobby's old. rusted rim nailed up
over the garage. Makes one. Bobby applauds.

DREW
You want to play?
BOBBY .
Gotta make a call. Maybe later, okay?

Drew nods, not surprised, turns back to his game. Bobby
takes a few steps toward the gate, then stops. Turns back,

watches Drew dribble, take another shot. Looks to the house
again, then drops his tools. CLAPS for the ball.

BOBBY (cont'd)
Pass it in.

Drew looks up, what? His father CLAPS again. Drew passes
him the ball. Bobby dribbles, puts a move on his son, but
the kid picks it up, defends. Bobby fakes left, goes right
hard, knocks Drew backwards onto his ass on the asphalt.
Takes the lay-up. Recovers the ball.

Drew stares up at his Dad. Shit. But Bobby offers no
apology, extends a hand to his still startled son.

BOBBY (cont'd)
First one to eleven?

Drew doesn't take the offered hand. Stands on his own, ready
to rumble. Bobby grins, pops the ball to a determined Drew.

WE PULL SLOWLY AWAY as Drew comes at his father hard, one
way, then the other. No mercy. Bobby laughs, Drew scoots
around him fast in the fading afternoon light of the alley,
stops short. Bobby falls for it, Drew takes the open jumper.
Drew grins as the ball falls in and we --
