EXT. WEST SIDE HIGHWAY — NIGHT

O A black dog sleeps on the shoulder of the highway, head .
. between his paws, curled up next to the barricade that
separates the north and southbound lanes.

Traffic rumbles past him: yellow cabs, blue police cruisers
white limousines with tinted glass and Jersey plates.

We hear the squeal of brakes. A black *65 Ford Mustang, mint
condition, pulls onto the shoulder, ten yards past the dog, |
and backs up. The.dog raises its head. ‘

Two men step out of the car. The driver, MONTY BROGAN, mid-

twenties, is pale-skinned in the flickering light. A small j
silver crucifix hangs from a silver chain around his neck; ~-

his fingers are adorned with silver rings.

The passenger, KOSTYA NOVOTNY, ‘a hulking man in his late :
thirties, blows his nose in his handkerchief. |

It's a cold night. Monty wears a camel's hair overcoat,
Kostya an old blue Soviet Navy coat.

 

MONTY
He's alive.
KOSTYA f ~)
(Ukrainian accent) ~
This dog, how do you call it?
MONTY :
Pit bull. Must have lost somebody some

. money.
The dog stares at them and they stare at the dog.
KOSTYA

I was thinking of shooting him.

KOSTYA
Shooting him? Are you sick in the head?

The dog continues to stare at them impassively, his face lit
by the passing headlights. The pavement by his paws is

littered with broken glass, twisted scraps of metal, black
rubber from blown tires.

MONTY
They just left him here to die. They
threw him out the window and kept
driving.

  

A ship's horn sounds from the Hudson.

KOSTYA
Come, my friend, it is cold. Come, people
wait for us.

MONTY
They're used to waiting.

Monty squats near the dog and inspects him. From this angle

it is clear that the pit bull has been badly abused. One ear
has been chewed to mince; his hide is scored with cigarette

burns; flies crawl in his bloodied fur.

MONTY. (CONT'D)
I think maybe his hip—

The dog pounces, jaws snapping,; lunging for Monty's face.
Monty stumbles backwards. The dog, too badly injured to

ms,

Ca) continue the attack, remains in his crouch, growling.

Monty sits on the pavement, shaking his head.
MONTY (CONT'D)

 

Christ.
(beat ) .
He's got some bite: left.

KOSTYA
I think he does not want to play with
you. Come, you want police to pull over?
You want police looking through your car?

MONTY
Look what they did to him. Used him for a

fucking ashtray.
Monty stands and dusts his palms on the seat of his pants.

MONTY (CONT'D)
Let's get him in the trunk.

KOSTYA
What?

MONTY
There's a vet emergency room on the East
Side. I like this guy.

KOSTYA
You like him? He tries to bite your face
off. Look at him, he is meat. You want
some dog, I buy you.nice puppy tomorrow.

Monty is not listening. He walks back to his car, opens the
trunk, pulls out a soiled green army blanket.

Kostya holds up his hands: stop.

KOSTYA (CONT'D)
Wait one minute, please. Please stop one
minute? I do not go near pit bull. Monty?
I do not go near pit bull.

Monty, carrying the army blanket, walks back toward the dog.

This is a good dog. I can see it in his
eyes. He's a tough little bastard.

KOSTYA
Sometimes I think you are very stupid
man.

The dog has slumped back to the pavement. His breath, comes.in. .

shorts rasps and wheezes. But he never takes his eyes off the
two men.

MONTY
We wait much longer, he'll be dead.

- KOSTYA ;
One minute ago you want to shoot him.

MONTY.
That was a mercy thing. But he's not
ready to go yet.

KOSTYA
Yes? He told you this?

Monty slowly circles behind the dog, holding the blanket the
way a matador wields his cape.

MONTY
_ Distract him.

Kostya stares at his friend in disbelief. He looks down. A
crumpled soda can lies by his feet. He kicks the can.

The dog's head pivots to follow the aluminum flash.

Monty hurls the blanket over the dog and spring forward,
wrapping his arms around the dog's midsection. The dog
growls, bites the wool, tries to break the blanket's neck.

flonty lurches toward the Mustang, struggling to retain his
bearhug while the pit bull slithers in his grasp. As they

stumble closer to the car the dog releases the blanket and
snaps at Monty's throat.

Monty hurls the dog into the trunk and slams the lid. He
returns to the driver's seat.

Kostya watches him in silence, stares at the sky for a few
seconds, finally gets back in the car. The dog thrashes in
the trunk.
INT. MUSTANG .
Both men sit in silence as Monty revs the engine. Blood is
beginning to leak from a bite on the right side of Monty's
neck. | :

KOSTYA .

What goes on in your little head?

Monty grins. He has no idea that he's bleeding.

M

IONTY
I got him, didn't I? Surprised you how
--—quick I was, huh? :

Monty checks for traffic and pulls back onto the highway.

KOSTYA _ :
Yes, you are so quick.

He points at the wound on Monty's neck, which has begun to
flow faster.

KOSTYA (CONT'D)
Meanwhile, you are bleeding.
MONTY
That's the dog's blood.
KOSTYA

Oh? Because you have hole in your neck
and blood is coining out.

CONTINUED: . . Pppeate

Monty lifts his hand to his neck and feels the blood.

MONTY
They'll stitch it up at the vet's.

KOSTYA
Rule number one: don't grab half-dead pit
bulls. We have people waiting for us,
people with money, and you 9° playing
cowboy-— no, dogboy- in middle of
highway.

Monty laughs, his hand pressed to the side of his neck, blood

leaking between his fingers.

KOSTYA (CONT'D)
Yes, ha ha. You're bad luck. You othae
bad’ luck on me. Always everything tha
can go wrong, goes wrong. It is not just

Monty frowns.

Doyle's law? You mean Murphy's law.

KOSTYA
Who's Murphy?

MONTY
Who's Doyle? Murphy's law: whatever can
go wrong, will go wrong.

Yes. Him,

EXT. EAST RIVER ESPLANADE — DAWN
TITLE CARD: Four Years Later

Monty sits on a park bench overlooking the East River. He
stubs out his cigarette, pulls another from his pack, lights
it.

The black pit bull, now healthy and well-fed, squats by

Monty's side. It is winter: the dog's warm breath rises as
white vapor.

-Two tough-looking YOUNG MEN walk by, wearing hooded

sweatshirts below their down parkas, one of them leading his
spike-collared rottweiler.

Monty tugs on his leash and Doyle grunts and quiets down.

YOUNG MAN 1
What up, Monty.

Monty nods but doesn't say anything. He's studying the view.
He stares at the green river, the steel bridges, the red
tugboats, the stone lighthouse of Roosevelt Island.

Doyle barks and Monty turns. SIMON, a bone-thin man in his
early thirties, approaches them. He wears rubber boots that
rise to his knees and a dirty yellow down parka.

SIMON
Easy, Doyle, easy, buddy. What's up
there, Monty?

Monty turns back to the river. Doyle barks again.

SIMON (CONT'D)
You want to tell the dog to relax? Hey
there, Doyle. Good dog.

Q),A Doyle has extended the leash as far as Monty will allow. He
~7 sniffs suspiciously at Simon.

SIMON (CONT'D)

Simon points at a line of scabs that run along his throat.

SIMON |
Cut myself shaving this morning— four
times. Can't keep my hands steady. Come
on, Monty, help me out. I can't go to |
Harlem. Look at me—- they'll eat me alive
up there.

Monty finally stands and walks toward the man, closer and
closer until their faces are inches apart.

MONTY
You need to leave me alone, friend. I
told you, I'm out of business.

Doyle sniffs Simon's boots, then raises his head, snout
climbing the man's ted. Simon dances a half-step, trying to
keep away from the pit bull without provoking him. _)

_ SIMON ;

~ Doyle, rubs his nose with the back of his hand.

Five years I've been coming to you. All
right, all right, I'm leaving. There's no
need to be nasty.

Monty and Doyle watch the man go; they begin walking in the
opposite direction. They pass the concrete chessboards, the
sandboxes, and. pause for a moment by a basketball court.

Six TEENS play— with little skill— one last game before
school. Monty shakes his head disdainfully, watching one
player dribble at the top of the key.

The player drives right and misses an open lay-up. Monty
spits and continues walking, Doyle leading the way.

EXT. CAMPBELL-SAWYER HIGH SCHOOL — LATER

Monty looks up at the old private school, tucked away on a
leafy street on the Upper East Side.

Two TENTH GRADE GIRLS look at Monty as they pass by. People
are always looking at Monty.

Both girls take long final drags on their cigarettes before
crushing them out and entering the school.

INT. CAMPBELL-SAWYER HIGH SCHOOL

Monty walks down a corridor of the school building, Doyle
padding along beside him. STUDENTS, hurrying to thei
classes, stare at the dog and then at Monty. .

The bells ring and within moments the corridor is empty.
Monty stops before a row of framed photographs. He examines
one photograph and smiles.

INSERT PHOTOGRAPH

The Campbell-Sawyer basketball team. The players stand ina
semi-circle with their coaches. We move in closer on one face

We move closer still and the black-and-white face begins to

blur.

ADMINISTRATOR (0.S.)

Monty, lost ina reverie, looks up. The ADMINISTRATOR, a
tall, harried-looking woman in her mid-fifties, squints at
him through her glasses. ‘

Monty nods and continues on his way The administrator
watches man and dog walk down the long corridor.

INT. CAMPBELL-SAWYER CLASSROOM .
JAKOB ELINSKY stands at the blackboard, facing three rows of

uninspired teenage faces. He wears a tweed jacket that seems
a few sizes too large, with chalk stains on the sleeves.

Jakob is the same age as Monty but he seems younger. There is
& something adolescent in his slouch, in the way he chews his
ip.

One of his students, MARY D'ANNUNZIO (17), stands at her
desk, reading from a poetry textbook. Her eyes drown in pools
of painted shadow, her hair is dyed black, tattooed roses
garland her wrist.

Jakob watches her. We don't know the Campbell-Sawyer .dress .
code, but we can guess that she's violating it. We can also
guess that Jakob is watching her a little too avidly.

Her pierced navel is visible below her Donnas tee-shirt.

Monty stands there, holding up Doyle. Doyle scrambles out of
his arms and jumps on Jakob, nearly knocking the teacher
down, getting his dirty paws all over Jakob's jacket.

MONTY
Easy, Doyle.

Doyle immediately calms down, squatting by Jakob's feet and
staring up at the teacher.

JAKOB ;
Hey— uh, what's going on?

Jakob seems awkward around Monty, nervous.

MONTY

Look at him. He loves you.

Jakob looks at Doyle, who wags the stump of his tail.

MONTY (CONT'D)
He really loves you. So what are you

the dog. For the first time today, they're quiet.

JAKOB
Okay, so I'll see you later?

Monty nods.

MONTY
Tell Frank we'll meet up after midnight.

He leads Doyle away and Jakob closes the door, then: turns to
look at his silent class. The bell rings and all the students
grab their bags. ,

Jakob, alone in the room, sits on a sofa, his head in his
hands. He looks up when he hears a knock on the door.

Mary D'Annunzio peeks in-

Jakob shakes his head and looks up at the clock. 9:15. He
reaches for the phone sitting on the coffee table.

INT. SHREVE ZIMMER INVESTMENT BANK — SAME TIME

FRANK SLATTERY, also in his mid-twenties, stares at the row
of clocks on the far wall. Below each clock is a sign: Tokyo,
Hong Kong, Frankfurt, London. The clock marked New York reads
9:15.

The trading floor is one giant room: rows of TRADERS seated
& * ‘ before their computers, jabbering into their telephone
™ headsets. No women— the place is loud and aggressive.

 

Slattery is built like a former college wrestler: thick- |

A hundred million? Jesus, Frank.

SLATTERY
They authorized me to a hundred million.

Other traders sitting nearby have begun watching this
exchange, and Lichter is careful to keep his voice down.

LICHTER
A week ago. They raised your limit a week
ago, and you're already maxing out.

SLATTERY
I'm telling you, we're in for a low
number. One-forty, maybe one-thirty-five.

LICHTER
Cut your stake in half, all right? You've
been doing a great job, everyone knows
that, but I'm still your boss and I'm
telling you: sell those contracts.

Lichter grips Slattery's shoulder for a moment and then walks
toward his office (a real office, with walls anda door),
exchanging hellos with other traders on the floor.

sheets to all the traders. He hands a sheet to Slattery, | who

Two-fifty, two-seventy, somewhere in

Marcuse sits down again, disappearing behind the partition.
Slattery glowers at his desk. He picks up his phone and holds
the receiver to his ear, never dialing a number.

Lichter calls to Slattery from his office door.

LICHTER
Slattery! We're good?

Slattery nods and gives a thumbs up. As soon as Lichter
returns to his office, Slattery hangs up the phone.

Marcuse sticks his head above the partition again.

The. trading. floor suddenly— and eerily-% goes quiet.
Everyone's attention is fixed on the television monitors
hanging from the ceilings. The monitors are muted; closed
captioning-files along the bottoms of the screens.

Each monitor is tuned to the same station, a financial
network broadcasting the employment number's release. A
REPORTER wearing a bowtie reads the statistics.

Slattery bows his head. He holds his hands in his lap and
closes his eyes. For a long while the room is very quiet.

Then a commotion of shouts and groans riles the floor.

Everyone is hollering at the same time, and we can only make
out a few phrases.

Slattery looks up, at the nearest monitor. A white number is
emblazoned on a blue background: 138,112. Every monitor in
the room flashes the same number.

Slattery stares at his computer screen. There it is again,
displayed prominently in the largest window: 138, 112.

Slattery raises his eyebrows. He juggles the crumpled fax
sheet a few times and then tosses it over the partition,
where Marcuse is sitting.

‘ MARCUSE (0.S.)

Slattery grins and leans back in his chair, hands behind his

head.

EXT. MONTY'S BUILDING — LATE AFTERNOON
: A four-story walk-up on a quiet street in Yorkville. xy
os NATURELLE ROSARIO sits on the stoop steps, reading a book. .

Naturelle, in her early twenties, has the lean body of a
runner. It's cold outside but she doesn't seem to mind. When
she sees Mohty. coming she closes the book and stands.

“Monty, digging in his pocket for his keys, kisses her for an
answer. Naturellé closes her eyes.and tries to embrace him
but ‘Monty abruptly ends the kiss and climbs the stairs.

 

Doyle wags the stump of his tail.

She bends down to scratch him behind his mangled ear.

MONTY
Of course it was a beautiful day.

He holds the door open for her and Doyle.
INT. MONTY'S APARTMENT

Monty closes the apartment door behind Naturelle and Doyle,
. then locks it. There are five locks and a heavy steel
leadbolt.

Despite the ominous’ security, it's a nice one-bedroom
apartment, with hardwood floors and tall windows facing the
brownstones across the street.

Black-and-white photographs line the walls: shots of the
Manhattan skyline, of Bensonhurst, of Doyle. The largest
photo, hanging above the sofa, is of Brogan's Bar.

Doyle curls up next to the radiator and quickly falls asleep.
Monty sits on the sofa and flicks on the television with the

remote.

WEATHERMAN
The first major storm of winter is
heading our way—

Monty turns off the television. He stares at the dead screen.
Naturelle comes out of the kitchen carrying a jar of honey
and a spoon.

She hands, the jar to Monty, who opens it for her. She sits
—-=-+--e beside him and begins eating" the honey, watching him. He sees
her watching.

MONTY
what?

NATURELLE
What are you thinking about?

 

MONTY
What am I thinking about?

| He leans forward and unclips a hand-tooled leather holster
from the back of his belt. A "B" for Brogan is tooled into
the leather, stylized like the old Brooklyn Dodgers' logo.

1G A .40 caliber automatic, squat and black, rests in the
2 holster. Monty drops the holster onto the coffee table and
runs his fingers over the B. Naturelle stares at the gun.

And if I can't do that, if I can't figure
out how to walk through walls, I'm

Almost.

He watches her eat another spoonful of raw honey.

the bathwater.

He listens to the sound of running water.

CUT TO:

INT. MONTY'S BATHROOM — SIX MONTHS AGO

Naturelle sits on Monty's lap in the narrow bathtub. He's
massaging her shoulders. Music plays from a radio on the
windowsill.

She is laughing at something he just said. He leans closer
and kisses the back of her neck, behind her ears. She
stretches back, lifting one leg out of the bath.

He runs his hand down her thigh and then stops, looking at.
the Puerto Rican flag tattooed on her ankle. She follows his
gaze to the tattoo and then groans.

_ NATURELLE
Not this again.

MONTY oo
You were born in America, you lived in
America_your whole life, you've been to
Puerto Rico twice, for vacation. What is
that? I should get an Irish flag tattooed
on my ass cause my grandparents are from

there?

NATURELLE
You,don!t have room on your ass. for, an
Irish flag.

Monty dips his hands into the warm water, reaches below her,
grabs her butt. Naturelle shrieks and Monty laughs.

MONTY
Between you and me the kids will be just
right.

Loud pounding on the apartment door startles them. They stare
at each other. Doyle barks from the other room.

Naturelle gets out of the tub, pulls on a bathrobe, and goes
to answer the door. Monty waits, listening. He knows who it
is. He stares out the bathroom's open window.

 

 
Cc’) INT. MONTY'S LIVING ROOM — STILL IN FLASHBACK

Monty, wearing sweatpants and no shirt, walks into the livin
room. Four D.E.A. AGENTS, all wearing D.E.A. windbreakers an
shoulder holsters, wait for him.

Doyle, ears back, growls at the agents. Monty scratches
Doyle's head and the dog relaxes a bit.

Naturelle, panicked, stares at Monty. She's still holding the
apartment door open.

MONTY
Close the door, baby.
She closes the door.

AGENT BRZOWSKI
Montgomery Brogan?

MONTY
Yeah.

Brzowski flips open a badge and hands a paper to Monty, who
looks it over.

Oo AGENT BRZOWSKI

I'm Agent Brzowksi with the Drug
Enforcement Agency. We've got a warrant
to search your apartment.

Brzowksi walks over to the sofa and sits down. The other
three agents stroll around the apartment. One looks out the
window; one starts flipping through a magazine on the coffee
table; one stares at a photograph on the wall.

AGENT CUNNINGHAM

You take this picture?

MONTY
Yeah.

AGENT CUNNINGHAM
Nice picture.

When one of the agents steps too close to Doyle, the dog
growls and the agent jumps back.

Monty whistles and Doyle stands and walks over to him. Monty
crouches, one hand stroking Doyle's thick neck.

Naturelle, uncomfortable wearing only the bathrobe, begins
heading back to the bedroom.

AGENT BRZOWSKI (CONT'D)
Ms. Rosario? That's your name, right? I
need you to stay right here, ma'am.

He winks at her.

AGENT BRZOWSKI (CONT'D)
Can't have you sneaking around.

Naturelle leans against the wall, looking for a sign from
Monty, who gives her none.

The agents don't seem to be searching very hard.

AGENT BRZOWSKI (CONT'D)
Hm.

He stares down at the sofa he's sitting on.

AGENT.BRZOWSKI (CONT- 2)
This sofa is not very comfortable.

Monty stares at the agent for a second and then exhales. He
turns and looks carefully at Naturelle.

AGENT CUNNINGHAM

staring at Naturelle, who meets his eye for a second and then
_ quickly turns away.

 

AGENT BRZOWSKI (CONT'D)
Maybe it's the padding?

AGENT CUNNINGHAM
Could be the padding.

Brzowski picks up the center cushion, turns it in his hands,
and unzips it. .

AGENT BRZOWSKI

He pulls out handfuls of white fiber filling and lets them
drift to the floor. Monty and Naturelle watch.

raises his palms to the air. The’ snow has begun to fall.

him,

Kostya watches her. She lets the curtain close. Kostya takes
another slug from his flask.

What's down there?

The boys point and Monty looks. We follow his gaze. We can't
see anything at first, but then, as if our eyes were
adjusting to the dark, we begin to pick out movement.

A gang of large RATS crawls through the tracks, nosing
through balled-up paper bags, candy wrappers and orange
peels.

BOY 1
These ones, they eat rat poison like
chocolate.

The biggest rat of all sniffs around the base of an upright
wax-paper coffee cup that sits just outside the third rail.

Monty reaches into the pocket of his camel's hair coat and
pulls out a handful of change.

_ MONTY
Watch this.

He selects a quarter and— with a free throw motion as smooth
as Hersey Hawkins's— tosses it into the empty cup, a ten-

The big rat, startled, hustles into the alcove below the lip
of the platform. The hoys, impressed, whistle. .

holding the bar and smiling down at Monty. A blonde, blandly
handsome man, Trey looks like he might have rowed for Yale's

EXT. BROGAN'S BAR — NIGHT

The snow is falling faster. We watch the flakes spin through
a yellow cone of streetlight.

We see the bar from the street.. The name "Brogan's Bar &
Grill" is written in gold script on the storefront window.

From the outside it looks like any other Bensonhurst bar,
neon beer signs hanging in the window.

A BARTENDER wipes down the bartop with a rag and a spray-

Monty sits at a corner table with his father, JAMES BROGAN,
fifty. Each man has a pint of Guinness. The older Brogan was
clearly a fine-looking man in his day, but the years have
been hard on him.

Monty points at the Tiffany-glass sconces on the wall.

MONTY
Where'd you find those?

MR. BROGAN
Estate sale in Sheepshead Bay. Old lady
dies and her kids sell everything five
days later. The china- she probably
thought her great “grandkids would be
eating off those plates.

MONTY
Maybe they didn't need any more plates.

It was beautiful china.

Monty leans back in his chair and surveys the place. Not that
he hasn't’ seen the bar a thousand times— he's having a hard
time looking directly at his father. .

RUTH (60), a waitress with a face like a crumpled paper bag,
arrives with the food: pork chops for the elder Brogan, a
steak for Monty.

No thanks. I'd rather say goodbye here.

Mr. Brogan pulls a small photograph from his wallet and hands
it to his son.

MR. BROGAN
Take this. They'll let you keep it.

Monty holds the picture carefully.
INSERT: PHOTO - :

James Brogan, twenty years younger, his arm around his
beautiful wife. The six-year-old Montgomery Brogan stands in
front of them, wearing yellow pajamas and a red plastic
fireman's helmet, staring at the floor. .

sleep in that fireman's helmet. Your

INT. ELEUTHERIA GREEK RESTAURANT — NIGHT

UNCLE BLUE, SENKA VALGHOBEK, and VICTOR GEDNY sit on the
private balcony that overlooks the restaurant's main room.

The place is furnished in classic Outer Borough Greek
fashion: whitewashed walls, clay-tiled floors, posters of the
Parthenon at dawn and Santorini at sunset.

Uncle Blue owns the place. He's a fierce-looking man with a
thick black beard, powerful hands, and no tolerance for
incompetence. It's hard to determine his age— anywhere from
forty to sixty.

Valghobek, his lieutenant, looks at first glance like an
overweight suburban dad. But on closer inspection there is
something absolutely mirthless in his smile, a meanness
around his eyes. He's in his late forties.

Gedny, mid-thirties, Uncle Blue's lawyer, wears a shiny suit,
a gold bracelet, and a deep, artificial-looking tan.

Gedny busily eats his shrimp and feta while the other two
watch him. Gedny gestures toward the windows.

GEDNY
Starting to snow.

UNCLE BLUE
You met with Brogan this morning. eee

Uncle Blue's accent, like his age, is difficult to pin down.
He could be Afghani or Iranian or Turkish. . . :

GEDNY
I did, yeah.

Gedny reaches for his wine, takes a sip.

UNCLE BLUE

Listen, one hundred percent certain, the
kid didn't flip. They would not be
sending him to Otisville if he flipped.

Uncle Blue and Valghobek exchange glances. It's clear they
don't have much respect for the lawyer.

UNCLE BLUE
We're talking about human behavior, Mr.
Gedny. Nothing is one hundred percent

certain.
VALGHOBEK
Don't assume they're idiots.
GEDNY

That's just it. They're not idiots. No
way in hell the kid's still walking
around out here if he flipped Federal.
Second he goes he's gone, right? If he's
their star witness, they'd have

Gedny forks another shrimp and eats it.

VelVet parties? Aside from getting locked
up for seven years.

UNCLE BLUE

Gedny laughs but quickly notices that Uncle Blue and.
Valghobek are not amused.

GEDNY
Listen, they found six hundred and fifty
g's in your boy's sofa cushion. They got
every white junkie on the East Side
saying Brogan's the sell. Game over.

Uncle Blue and Valghobek say nothing. Gedny licks his lips-

GEDNY (CONT'D) :
It's U.S. Code. There's nothing to argue.
Who do I argue with, the fucking grid?
It's seventy-eight to ninety-seven
months, automatic. I kept him out of

The. judge.kept him out of -stepback. Why? -
If he's not talking with the Federals,
how come he's still on the street?

Gedny shrugs.

GEDNY
It's pretty common for non-violent
offenders. He's a white boy with no
record and his.father put up his bar as
the bail bond. They're not worried about
him jumping.

Uncle Blue and Valghobek watch the lawyer, impassive and
silent.

Monty walks down the snow-covered street, hands in the
pockets of his camel's hair coat. He watches everything
intently: the passersby, the cars swerving through the slush,

INT. SLATTERY'S APARTMENT — NIGHT

Slattery opens the door and Jakob hurries in, his Yankees hat
(which e wears for the rest of the night) and coat dusted
with snow.

SLATTERY
It's really coming down, huh?

Slattery lives in_a Young Man with Money without Woman
Apartment. The television set in the living room is so large
that the weatherman startles Jakob.

The living room itself is bigger than many Manhattan
apartments, but it's empty except for the television, an old
sofa, a coffee table, a:Persian rug (still rolled) under the
windows, and a shiny red electric guitar in the corner.

Slattery returns to the sofa, bottle of beer in hand, while
Jakob remains standing, brushing the snow from his coat.

SLATTERY
It means if he didn't get arrested, he
wouldn't be alive in seven years. They'd
find him under the Manhattan Bridge with
two bullets in his head.

Jakob thinks about this for a second before picking up a

Campbell-Sawyer crest, loosely knotted ties.

Young Slattery picks up a strand of limp spaghetti from his
plate.

YOUNG SLATTERY
Watch this.

He sticks one end up one nostril while his friends stare at
him.

Slattery snorts and then blows his nose. Monty and Jakob back
away in disgust. Slattery sticks a finger into his other
nostril and pulls down the end of the spaghetti strand.

One end of the spaghetti strand now dangles from each
nostril. He pulls on each end, a little this way, a little
that way.

Huh? Nah, it's a nickname. His real
name's Like Ankaybusim or something, but
no one can pronounce it.

Frank wants to be a redneck. He comes

for the Packers.

Slattery rubs the calluses on his palm and Jakob stares at
the floor. Jody laughs at their morose reaction.

JODY (CONT'D)
You don't have to come! I was just
saying.
Monty raises his glass and Slattery and Jakob grab their
glasses and raise them too.

MONTY
Fuck Sunday.

He drinks. Slattery and Jakob hesitate and then follow suit.

EXT. VELVET — NIGHT

Monty steps out of a taxi, followed by Slattery and Jakob. A
roiling MOB occupies half the block, crowding in front of the
entrance to the dance club.

Most are teenagers. They clot together in groups of fours and
fives, smoking cigarettes and stomping their feet to keep
warm. Almost none are dressed for the snow.

MONTY
The whole city came out to say goodbye.

at him as he walks by.

Monty makes his way to the velvet ropes. KHARI GREENE, a
pillar of a man wearing the exact same camel's hair coat as
Monty, stands by the door, checking names off a clipboard.
Two pale scars run in parallel lines down Khari's left cheek

Khari skeptically fingers the sleeve of Monty's coat.

KHARI

Monty hesitates and then laughs. Khari puts his arm around
Monty's shoulders.

to turn around, forced to stare into the unnaturally bright
eyes of Mary D'Annunzio. .

Monty recognizes her from the classroom.

Monty pushes open the door at the stop of the staircase. The
noise rushes in, overwhelmingly loud, the bass vibrating in
our bones.

   

Mary opens her mouth and speaks, but we might not be able to
hear it over the music.

MARY

INT. VELVET VIP ROOM — MOMENTS LATER

Monty leads Jakob and Mary into the VIP room. Naturelle is
already there, speaking with Slattery.

The walls of the VIP room are covered with crushed red
velvet. The couches: are upholstered in red velvet, the small
bar in the corner is draped with red velvet, the carpet is
red faux velvet.

 

DJ Dusk's music pours from speakers bolted into the corners.
His beats are impossible to sit still for, incorporating
elements of bossa nova, techno, hip hop, and jazz.

:

 

Slattery has a hard time keeping his eyes off Naturelle. His . |
gaze tends to slide her way, and his desire for her is
apparent to everyone.

Naturelle smiles when she sees Monty and goes to him. She
looks beautiful in-the silver dr.ess...-Se..hugs him. Monty
stands awkwardly in her embrace.

When she realizes he's not returning the hug, she quickly
releases him. He's watching her carefully. She sees Jakob and
smiles at him.

Hey, Jake.

She hugs Jakob. Mary has not stopped dancing since first |

She turns and examines Monty more closely.

MARY (CONT'D)
Who are you? Are. you somebody famous?

MONTY
Do us a favor, D'Annunzio. Don't talk too
much.

Mary grins, tears off her fake fur coat, and hides it
underneath a sofa. She wears a white tank-top with Tweety
Bird emblazoned on the front. Tweety Bird looks scared.

DAPHNE, a young waitress in a green dress, comes over with a
tray of champagne flutes. Naturelle kisses Daphne on the
cheek and the two women exchange greetings. Everyone takes a
glass.

MONTY (CONT'D)

Champagne for my real friends, real pain
for my sham friends.
Everyone takes a sip except for Mary, who guzzles hers in one
giant gulp, then belches and wipes her mouth with the back of
her hand. Jakob stares at her, horrified.

MARY
Anyone want to go dance?

Naturelle glances at Monty.

MONTY

Daphne sets a champagne bottle in an ice bucket on the table,
then retreats to the small bar in the corner of the room.

Monty sits on the red velvet sofa and Jakob lies down next to
him, covering his eyes with his arm.

Doyle's the toughest guy I know. He was
lying there off the highway when I found
him, waiting to die. He knew he was going
to die. And he didn't make a sound. The
best thing I ever did, my whole life, was
rescue that black little son-of-a-bitch.
Every day he's had since then is because

there he is, the best thing I ever did,
in the flesh.

I'm not going to let the pound have him.
Doyle's the ugliest fucking dog in the
five boroughs. Who's gonna adopt him? And
I'm telling you now, I will not let a vet
stick a needle in him and end him. I
saved his life, right? I'm responsible
for him. I didn't go through all that
just so some vet can put him to sleep. If
it comes to that, I'll do it myself. I'll
put a bullet in his ear tonight. So I'm
asking you, Jake- for me, as a favor for
me, and it's a big favor but I'm asking
you— will you take him? Will you take
him home with you?

Jakob is quiet, rubbing his palms over the red velvet sofa

MARY
You think my mother gives a shit? Anyway/

snow day for sure.

JAKOB
I need to go to sleep.

Mary lies back on the sofa and kicks her feet in the air. She
begins a bicycling motion, her hands behind her head.

MARY
Can't sleep yet. He's turning it on.

Jakob looks at her slender pale ankles. He covers his eyes.
Mary rolls off the sofa.

MARY (CONT'D)
Is there a bathroom in here?

Jakob points.

JAKOB
Over there, I think.

Mary winks at him and makes her way across the room. En route
she grabs a champagne flute off Daphne's platter and chugs
it. She replaces the glass and slips into the bathroom.

Jakob watches her go. He watches the bathroom door close
behind her. He stands, a bit unsteadily. He's been drinking
all night. He weaves his way to the bathroom door.

He waits. Eventually Mary opens the door. She looks up at
Jakob, her"eyes as wide as Tweety Bird's.

/ MARY
You need: to pee?

JAKOB
No.

He presses forward, backing her up, and closes the door
behind him.

Her teeth glow in the blue light. Jakob grabs her by the
shoulders and kisses her hard on the mouth. His hands begin
to move down from her shoulders—

who stares at the floor. She looks stunned, the Yankees cap
sitting crookedly on her head.

Jakob stumbles backward. He tries to say something but can't
get the words out.

He turns arid rams through the bathroom door.
INT. VELVET VIP ROOM — CONTINUOUS ,

He shoves past cigar smokers and dancing women. He runs from
the VIP room.

The partiers watch him go and then turn to look at the
bathroom, a drop of blue in the overwhelming redness of the
VIP room.

Mary stands in the blue light, still looking at the floor.

INT. WHITE ROOM — LATER

The White Room got its name for obvious reasons. Everything
is white: the shag carpet, the walls, the overstuffed
furniture. .

Monty sits on a large white bean bag in a corner of the room.
He holds a champagne bottle in one hand, and takes occasional

sips.

He is watching two high school girls on the swings. One
blonde— LINDSAY JAMISON-— and one brunette— a younger
Naturelle.

Both girls wear the uniform of their private school: white
blouses embroidered with the school's initials and green
plaid skirts over black tights.

Both girls are smoking. But while Lindsay keeps the cigarette
clenched in-one hand as she swings higher, Naturelle
continues taking reckless drags., the crook of her elbow
holding the chain lightly as she soars skyward.

Monty stands and approaches the swings. The girls pretend not
to notice him.

MONTY
Hey!

The girls keep swinging.

MONTY (CONT'D)
Could I bum a smoke?

MONTY

Lindsay brakes with her feet and stares at Monty. |

Monty nods slowly. It's obvious he doesn't recognize her, but
he doesn't want to be rude.

MONTY

Monty's eyes are still closed. Now he opens them. His hands
are in Marguerite's hair, but now they drop by his side.

Finally he taps Marguerite on the shoulders. She backs away

Monty zips his fly.

INT. CLUB ROOM — LATER

The club room is decorated to look like the library of an
English country manor: dark wood paneling, bookshelves
stacked with leather-bound books, flickering sconce lights.

Slattery sits on a stool at the bar, rolling a glass of
whiskey between his palms. His eyes are red, from crying or |
exhaustion or both.

Naturelle walks into the room and spots Slattery. She goes
over to him and squeezes the back of his neck before sitting
on the neighboring stool. He sits up straight and smiles.

Again, Slattery has to turn away from the sight of her.

SLATTERY
This is all so stupid. It's so stupid.
He's got so much going on, he's so smart,
and what does he do? He throws it all
away. And here I am, his friend— I mean,
right? I'm his oldest friend?

 

NATURELLE
He loves you, Frank. You know that.

SLATTERY
His oldest friend, and what do I do to
stop it? Nothing, never a word. When he
started selling pot to kids in Campbell-
Sawyer, did I say anything? When
everyone's talking about buying from
Monty, the whole school, and I knew they
were going to nail him, knew it, did I
@& say a word? The last ten years I watch
him get deeper and deeper, and these

EXT. 14TH STREET — LATER

Monty trudges down the sidewalk, followed by Slattery and
Jakob. The snow continues to fall, and lies thickly drifted
on the crookedly-parked cars, on the parking meters, on the
spears of the church gate they pass.

They reach the Union Square subway station and walk down the
stairs, disappearing from our view.

We slowly follow their path backward. In the yellow shine of
the streetlights the footprints fill with snow, until finally

Monty, Frank, and Jakob sit with their backs against the
“™''corrugated shutters of a closed newspaper stand.

An OLD MAN, wearing a garbage bag with a hole cut out for his
head, leans against a blue I-beam that helps support the
ceiling. He holds a small radio to his ear; we can hear

The parked cars lining the avenue look like scoops of vanilla
ice cream, glistening below the streetlights. The awnings of
the buildings, fringed with icicles, creak beneath the weight

of the snow.

Doyle, off his leash, charges down the middle of the avenue,
carving a trail through the foot-deep powder, a drop of ink
rolling down a blank page.

Monty follows behind, twirling circles with the leash.
Slattery and Jakob bring up the rear, slogging through the
e weary soldiers.

The only vehicle on the road is a snow plow half a mile
south, its yellow lights flashing.

EXT. CARL SCHURZ PARK

They cross into the park, past the fenced-in gingko trees,
climbing the stairs that lead to the esplanade.

Doyle spies a squirrel and chases after it, but the squirrel
is quicker, makes it to a red maple and scrambles up the
‘trunk to safety.

Doyle squats at the foot of the tree, staring sadly up
through the branches. .

EXT. EAST RIVER ESPLANADE
Across the river is Queens, and Queens before sunrise is
beautiful: red antennae lights winking to warn pilots; the

Pepsi sign glowing in neon script over the bottling plant;
white clouds rising from the smokestacks like genies.

Behind Queens the-sky is beginning to brighten. soos
Jakob brushes snow off the iron balustrade, leans against it

and ‘stares into the river.’ A string of yellow-lights quivers
beneath the waters, reflections from the Queensboro Bridge.

A red tugboat chugs south.

MONTY

You think I don't see you staring at her
all the time? You've wanted to fuck her
for years.

He shoves Slattery hard. Slattery's eyes narrow for a moment,
but he shakes his head.

SLATTERY
All right. All right.

He turns stiffly and walks away.

' JAKOB
Come on. Come on, Monty, what are you
doing? Tell him you're kidding.

Monty pivots and punches Jakob hard on the cheek, the crack
of gloved knuckle on bone echoing on the empty esplanade.

Jakob falls back against the balustrade, clutching his face.

JAKOB (CONT'D)
MontyI

Monty steps closer and punches Jakob again, this time in the
gut, and Jakob sinks to his knees, gasping. He covers his
face with his hands, to protect himself.

Slattery tackles Monty, pinning him to the ground.

For a moment everything is still. Doyle, leashed to the
baluster, whines, unsure if his master is playing or
fighting.

Jakob, stunned by the violence, -watches. Slattery stares at
Monty and Monty stares back. All :of them in the snow, their
breath coiling and rising into the sky.

Finally Slattery looks away, looks past the East River, past
Queens. He clenches his eyes shut. When.he opens them, we see
the first tears forming.

Slattery grabs Monty's throat with his left hand and punches
him in the face with his right, again and again and again.

Doyle howls. He tries to jump on Slattery but the leash keeps
yanking him back. He strains forward, fangs bared, but his
master is three feet too far.

Jakob touches his cheek and examines his fingers: no blood.

Doyle, barking madly, keeps jumping for Slattery, keeps being
yanked back by the leash.

Jakob grabs hold of the balustrade and pulls himself to his
feet.

JAKOB (CONT'D)
Frank... Frank!

The blood puddles by Monty's head, melting through the snow
and steaming in the air. Slattery, lost in his anger, his
frustration, continues swinging.

Jakob stumbles over to Slattery and pushes him.

JAKOB (CONT'D)
Stop!

Slattery looks up, his face wet with tears, a webbing of
saliva between his lips.

JAKOB (CONT'D)
Okay. Enough.

Jakob grabs the big man under the armpits and helps him rise.
Slattery looks down at Monty, who is not moving.

SLATTERY
Oh Jesus.

Jakob crouches and turns Monty onto his stomach. Monty
coughs, a thick ribbon of blood falling from his mouth.

Jakob scoops up a handful of snow and begins gently pressing
it to Monty's brutalized face.

Doyle continues to bark, the collar digging into his throat
as he struggles to reach his master.

Slattery watches, speechless, his bloodied hands by his side.

Finally Monty shakes his head clear of the snow and begins
crawling forward.

 

Tl for a minute.-Hold still. ~~

When Monty tries to stand his legs collapse beneath him.
Jakob wraps his arms around him before he falls and lowers
him to the snow.

JAKOB (CONT'D)
Don't try to move yet.

Monty pushes himself off the ground again and this time
Manages to keep his balance, though he sways like a drunk.

Blood leaks from his nose, from his mouth, from a deep gash
bisecting one eyebrow. The entire left side of his face is

bright red, already swelling.

Slattery looks at him and moans, sits down heavily in the
snow, his chin tucked against his chest, his right hand,
slick with blood, covering his face.

SLATTERY
Oh Jesus.
JAKOB
Hospital.. We need to take you to the
hospital.
MONTY
No.

He staggers toward them. Doyle is mewling now, stomping his
paws, confused. Monty bends down unsteadily and scratches

behind the dog's ear.

MONTY (CONT'D)
(to Doyle)
Be a good boy.

He walks over to Slattery, who sits in the snow, sobbing.
Monty leans over and kisses his forehead.

MONTY (CONT'D)
I'm sorry.

Slattery rocks back and forth, hands over his face, his
forehead marked with blood.

Monty turns to Jakob and touches his shoulder.

MONTY (CONT'D)
I'm sorry, Jake.

Jakob is stunned by what's happened in the last few minutes.
He has no idea what to say.

JAKOB
Okay.

MONTY
Take care of my dog.

He grabs his coat from the park bench and walks away from
them.

EXT. MONTY'S BUILDING — DAWN

Naturelle, in her down parka, sits on the stoop steps. She
sees him when he's a block away, and we see him from that
distance, limping through the snow.

Naturelle stands and breathes in deeply. She starts walking
toward him but stops after a few steps. She can see his face
now.

His eyes are so badly swollen that he doesn't notice her
until he's almost upon her. When he does see her he smiles,
and Naturelle has to look away for a moment.

He tries to say somethin but chokes, leans over, hands on
his knees, and spits up blood.

Naturelle takes him by the hand and leads him up the steps.
INT. MONTY'S LIVING ROOM

He sits on the sofa while Naturelle dabs at his face with a
wet washcloth. A bowl of soapy water sits beside her on the
coffee table.

When she wrings the washcloth above the bowl, drops of blood
fall into the water and bloom.

MONTY
I don't want you to visit.

- His voice is rough and slurred, his split lip impeding his
. diction.

She opens a bottle of rubbing alcohol, wets a cotton ball,
presses .the cottpn lightly against the gash in his forehead.

He shudders, his fingers gripping the edges of the sofa

~ cushions.

MONTY (CONT'D)
I don't want you to see me up there.

Naturelle struggles mightily to keep herself together. She
continues cleaning his wounds.

MONTY (CONT'D)
Why'd you stay with me?

You should have left a long time ago.

swollen eyelids at the man walking toward him.

The blurred figure of a_man stands before him. The room is
sunlight and shadows, all edges washed away;

The man's face is a pale oval that bends and splits when he
speaks.

Monty sitting on the sofa, staring up at his father.

tell--

MONTY

He pushes ‘himself upright. Naturelle comes in from the
Kaitchen and hands him a glass of water. He takes it and
rinks

Monty blinks and then nods.

MONTY
No hospitals.

Mr. Brogan kisses Naturelle on the cheek and she embraces the
older man. When she lets go he walks to the front door, picks
up the suitcase, and leaves the apartment.

Monty stands still, looking at Naturelle.

NATURELLE
Wait a second.

She goes to the kitchen and Monty rocks back and forth on his
bootheels. When she returns she holds a plastic bag filled
with ice cubes.

She makes him hold the bag against the side of his face. They
don't move for a moment, her hand on top of his hand, the bag
of ice pressed to his jaw.

MONTY
I want you to be happy.

She nods but says nothing, biting her lip, tears beginning to
roll down her face. :

MONTY (CONT'D)
Will- you. d© that for me? ooo no

She nods again.

She grabs him and holds him very hard, clutching him, sobbing
into his neck.

Mr. Brogan opens the passenger door and Monty eases carefully

After Mr. Brogan starts the engine, they wait for a moment

EXT. EAST RIVER ESPLANADE — DAWN

Slattery sits ona park bench overlooking the river. It's the
same bench Monty sat_on the day before. Slattery is alone on
the snow-covered esplanade.

His knuckles are covered with dried blood. His forehead is
marked with blood.

He watches the sun rise over Queens.

EXT. EAST END AVENUE — DAWN

Jakob and Doyle walk south along the western edge of Carl
Schurz Park. A SKIER, an attractive young woman in her mid-
twenties, schusses toward them.on cross-country skis.

She smiles at Jakob as she passes.

watches the city roll by. It's his last look for a long time,

shuttered butcher shop. Two YOUNG BOYS drag their sleds

driver's-side door and laughs into his walkie-talkie.

At a red light, Monty looks up at the city bus idling noisily
alongside them. A LITTLE BOY in the backseat waves. Monty
waves back. ©

The boy points at his window: letters have been finger-drawn
on the frosted glass. T-O-M.

Monty smiles as well as he can and draws his own name on his
own frosted window: M-O-N-

Before he can cross the T the bus pulls away.
They drive north.
