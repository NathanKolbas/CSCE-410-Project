FADE IN
LONG SHOT - A WOMAN (LILLIAN) - (1962) DAY 4

She is sitting in a rewboat on very quiet water, a.shacovy
silhouette in the morning mist. Reecs in foreground.

LILLIAN is past middle-age. She is wearing an old, wide-
brimmed straw hat, a man's loose shirt, dark pants, glasse:.

She is fishing, deep in thought. Finally:

_LILLIAN'S VOICE (9.8.)
Qld paint om canvas as it ages
sometimes becomes transparent.
When that happens, it is possible,
in some pictures, to see the original
_ lines; a tree will skow through a
woman's dress, a child makes way for
a dog, a boat is-no longer on an open

sea. That is called pentimento because
the painter ‘repented’, changed iis
mind.

You aren't being clear.

JOBANN reacts to some PEOPLE moving up the path toward

have now passed. She puts the cigarette away.

JOHANN
We would like you to carry for us
$50,000. We think you will be
without trouble, but we do not
guarantee that. The money is
Julia's money. With it we can
bribe out many already in prison.
And many who goon will be.

JOHANN
We are a small group who work

will meet you for the money, if
your consent is given, were small
publishers. We have Catholic,
Communist, many beliefs. Do you

LILLIAN lights her cigarette. JOHANN Watches her, avare

I am sorry time is too short. I
am aware you are ill at ease and
mot prepared for this meeting. I
must repeat we think all will go
well, but much could go wrong.

We realize that you are not the
best person for this mission
because you are Jewish. But
unfortunately there is no one
else we can ask. Julia says I
must tell you that, but you should
know this: if anything szould
happen, if the Nazis should arrest
you, Julia will use the American
Ambassador through her Uncle John.

LILLIAN
