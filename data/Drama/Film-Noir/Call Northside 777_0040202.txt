STOCK SHOTS - CHICAGO FIRE - (FROM "OLD CHICAGO")
Over these SHOTS comes the VOICE of the narrator:

NARRATOR'S VOICE
In the year 1871, a cow kicked over
a lamp and started the great fire
that destroyed Chicago. But, out
of the ashes of that catastrophe
sprang a new Chicago --

STOCK SHOTS - CHICAGO SKY LINE - SKYSCRAPERS -
FACTORIES - ETC.

Over the SHOT comes the narrator's VOICE:

NARRATOR'S VOICE
-- a Chicago of brick and brawn,
concrete and guts; with a short
history of violence beating in its !
pulse.

SHOTS OF CHICAGO NEWSPAPER BUILDINGS

, NARRATOR'S VOICE
That history is on the record, and
that record is kept by the news-
papermen who have made Chicago's
papers great.

SHOTS OF CHICAGO IN LATE 1952

These include shots of typical scenes in that period:
gangland warefare scenes, interspersed with shots of
flop-houses,; men gathered outside employment agencies
and men sleeping under newspapers..on park benches,

and perhaps a shot of someone selling apples on a
street corner + in all of them, the characteristically
brutal gusts of wind for which Chicago is known. The
narrator's VOICE continues:

NARRATOR'S VOICE :
No period in Chicago's history was
more violent than the years of the
depression. The rise and fall of
the bootlegging empires. was written
in blood and bullets. In 1932 =
there were 365 murders in Chicago -
one for each day of the year - eight
policemen were shot down in the line
of duty. One of the most cold-blooded
of these murders occurred on
December 9th, 1932, on South Ashland
Avenue, in a place operated by a
woman named Wanda Skutnike #.

(NOTE: The above is broken to cover the above-mentioned
SHOTS and atmospheric SHOTS of southside speakeasies.
The final portion of the narration comes over a:)

CLOSE SHOT - EXT. WANDA SKUTNIK'S PLACE
We are CLOSE on a sign on the window which reads:

"WANDA SKUTNIK
Groceries and Delicatessen"

CAMERA PULLS BACK and we see it is a bitterly colds
windy day. Passersby are muffled in their overcoats
and braced into the stiff wind. Traces of snow are
seen swirling on doorsteps and at the curb, A wagon
is stopping; the horse's head is lowered in the sharp
cold wind. It is loaded with sacks of coal. On its
side is lettered:

"JAN GRUSKA
COAL AND ICE”

GRUSKA, a man of about forty, is dismounting.
NARRATOR'S VOICE
Wanda Skutnik's store in the
Polish district was the front
for a speakeasy.

9 ' INT. BACK ROOM - WANDA'S PLACE - DAY

Along one side runs a makeshift bar. In o.g. empty
barrels and bottles. In the center of the room is a
- rough deal table, and in the back there is a pot-

cellied stove with a wood and coal box beside it. At
the center> table BORIS, a big, burly gorilla of a man
with huge black mustachios, is finishing his drink,
-WANDA SKUTNIK, the proprietress, a once attractive but
now blowsy woman of about thirty-five or six, is near
the stove, putting a few pieces of coal into it.

_ Boris looks at her with-dog-like devotion.

BORIS
(heavily)
You look nice, Wanda.

Wanda looks up, pleased, and walks over to the bar,

. WANDA
You say nice things, Boris,

BORIS
(softly)
Nice... .

Wanda grins at him. Now the door to the alley opens ;
and Gruska comes in, carrying a bag of coal. He dumps
the coal into the box near the potbellied stove, stamps
his feet and turns to look at Wanda.

GRUSKA
It's cold out. A man could freeze. -

Wanda looks at him wryly - produces a bottle and glass
and brings them over to the table,

‘WANDA
Help yourself.

Gruska grins, sits down and starts pouring a drink,
He nods at Boris, who nods back quietly and rises,

BORLS
I go now. .

Wanda holds out her hand and he drops a coin into it,

WANDA
See you tonight?

Boris. goes out the alley door, .and Wanda walks over to

the icebox and takes out of it a small paper bag, in

which she keeps her money. She takes a bill out of it

and goes toward Gruska. Off scene we hear the SOUND

of the'front door BELL. .
WANDA -

“Got change for a twenty?

GRUSKA
: (shrugs)
That's all right. Pay me next. time.

Wanda puts the bag back in the icebox as POLICEMAN JOHN *

W. BUNDY enters. He's a big man, grey at the temples,
and he's now beating his hands together to restore
circulation.

* BUNDY
Wanda, you're looking at a man with
a cold coming on. ~

Bundy walks to the potbellied stove. Wanda picks up
the. bottle and a glass, pours some in as she approaches
Bundy, and hands him the drink as he sits down before
the fire.

- WANDA
For a cold - this is good,

. BUNDY
Thanks. .

Gruska remains seated at the table. Bundy is now fac-
ing the stove, with his back to the door leading to the
store. Outside, we HEAR the store door open, and the
BELL ring, Wanda, who has just turned around after
handing the drink to Bundy, is facing the glass parti-
tion in the door that leads to the store.

MED. FULL SHOT - ANGLING PAST WANDA AS SHE LOOKS TOWARD
THE FRONT OF THE STORE

We can see two huge forms of two men outlined against

the daylighted windows of the. store. They are big and
menacing; but we cannot see their faces or distinguish
anything. about them.

Wanda still does not see them distinctly; but she gasps.

in fear when she sees the guns. She quickly dashes
into the closet. One of the men starts toward the ice-
box to get the money.. Then, together, both men are
aware of the blue-coated figure of Bundy, just as he
turns around. Gruska flings himself aside, and hides
behind a'table for protection. Bundy reaches for his
gun just as the two men start shooting. Bundy is hit,
but lunges for. one of the men and grapples with. him,
Suddenly another couple of shots are fired and Bundy
staggers backward. As he falls, we HEAR rather than
see the two men rushing off, because the door to the
front store swings closed as Bundy crashes to the floor
-- and we can HEAR the footsteps of the two men, the
door BELL, and the SLAM of the front door,

FULL SHOT - EXT. WANDA'S PLACE - DAY

The two men come walking rapidly out of the store to
their car. They do not have their guns in their handsy
Their faces are averted as WILLIAM DECKER, a mailman,
approaches. He looks curiously after them. ‘Then a gun
drops from under the coat of one of the men, right at
Decker's feet. The man stoops quickly and scoops it up.
Decker looks at him, stunned. Then the man gets into
the car and it drives off. Decker turns quickly into
Wanda!s place.

Gruska bends over Bundy and slowly the closest door
opens and Wanda peers out.

Just then Decker, the mailman, opens the door from the
front and looks in, in horror. Gruska looks up sudden-

As the headline fades out, the narrator's VOICE con-

NARRATOR'S VOICH
This cornered, frightened bootlegger
gave the tip that pointed suspicion
towards a man named Tomek Zaleska...

. . DISSOLVE TO:
FULL SHOT (FROM ABOVE) - THE WIECEK HOUSE

It is on a corner. Suddenly we can see police cars
piling into the two streets from all directions. Ten
or twenty men surround the house. It is a dismal
little wooden frame house with perhaps four families
living in it. It seems pitifully small to be attacked
by such great numbers, but the policemen, some armed
with sub-machine guns, others with side arms, deploy
behind doorways and approach cautiously, as if they
are in the process of arresting a dangerous criminal.

Penitentiary. This was in November of
1933. Frank and Tomek went to prison.

pencil circle around it.

MED. FULL SHOT - INT. TIMES NEWS ROOM - NIGHT

BRIAN KELLY, the city editor, is just putting down the
item. He is a quiet, chunky, very wise, soft-spoken
man of about 40. One of the characteristics about him
is that he smokes a brand of cigarettes with a hard
cardboard tip. He doesn't use an ash tray but absently
pulls the cigarette out of his mouth by clamping five
fingers right around it and then stands it up on his
deck, so that little clusters of half-burned cigarettes
are always sticking up like tiny monuments on his desk.
In the b.g. we can see the other reporters busy at their
desks and copy-boys walking around. Still frowning at
the item,. Kelly reaches for a cigarette, studies the
item again.

throws some copy into a basket, picks up the clipping

bucket of water which she continually pushes in front
of her. OVER SHOT we HEAR the slow methodic footsteps
of one man (hard heels on his shoes) echoing hollowly

But he wasn't lying. He isn't

Hets a Catholic. He still feels
