BLACK SCREEN
SCREAMS. CHEERS. The kind that only carnage elicits.

FADE UP ON:

ADONIS "DONNIE" CREED. SLOW MOTION - Stylized, backlit. All
muscles and sweat, ADONIS stands in a shaft of light. He
appears ready to explode into action. The MUSIC is a long,
SUSTAINED, deep tone.

ROCKY (V.O.)
It's only a three step climb up
into this ring - Three.

ADONIS slowly shifts from foot to foot.

ROCKY (V.0.)
-.. But someday it will feel as
high as a mountain.

In SLOW-MO, ADONIS pounds his gloves.

ROCKY (V.0.)
"Cause the ring is the loneliest
place in the world where nobody can
help ya an' all ya dreams are
crushed by one perfect punch.

ADONIS'S eyes are fixated on on his unseen OPPONENT.

ROCKY (V.0.)
».-. Ya ask yaself, am I in here to
prove something to other people or
prove somethin' to yaself?

ADONIS shifts from FOOT TO FOOT.

ROCKY (V.O.)
Ya better know ‘cause there's no
hidin' place when pain's smashin'
into ya body and face like a hot
hammer and ya scared to death and
wonderin', "Do I really have the
guts to go through this or have I
just been lyin' to myself?" Cause
in here, ya learn the real truth
once and for all -

ADONIS takes a deep breath.
ROCKY (V.O.)

++. That you can't be better than
you are.
2.

On the last WORD, there is a magnificent EXPLOSION of sound
as a CROWD OF THOUSANDS roars to life!!

It is JARRING and EXHILARATING.

COMMENTATOR #1 (0.S.)
There goes the bell for Round One!

INT. RING

Light heavyweight champion DANNY "STUNTMAN" WHEELER charges
at ADONIS - Straight aggression, PERSONAL. The CROWD goes
crazy!

ADONIS quickly SIDE STEPS and counters with a BLISTERING
right, left upper-cut and two more rights.

COMMENTATOR #1 (0.S.)
Wheeler's stunned early!

COMMENTATOR #2 (0.S.)
He's really rocked!

ADONIS pours it on! THE CROWD ROARS LOUDER!!

INT. ARENA

BIANCA, who is 5 MONTHS PREGNANT, jumps to her feet,
applauding wildly.

BIANCA
Go, D - Keep going!

INT. RING

ADONIS pounds away with amazing fury. It is a human machine
gun!

INT. AUDIENCE

ANTHONY, mesmerized, leans forward. (We will meet up and
learn more about him soon.)

INT. RING

ADONIS takes the counter flush and COUNTERPUNCHES,
overwhelming WHEELER with 15 UNANSWERED PUNCHES!!

COMMENTATOR #1 (0.S.)
Wheeler connects then - Oh, he is
countered!! And badly wobbled -
This is so unexpected!!

INT. RINGSIDE

Wheeler's trainer, LIL DUKE, screams for his hurt man to
fight back!
INT. RING - CORNER
ROCKY on his feet.

ROCKY
Stay on it! Body, head! Body, head!

INT. RINGSIDE - AUDIENCE

Dubious boxing promoter, BUDDY "KING" CHARLES eyes the event,
taking in the crowd's energy, loving it.

INT. RING
WHEELER struggles forward but is BOMBARDED and terribly CUT!
COMMENTATOR #2 (0.S.)
Wheeler attempts to get off the
ropes and is hit again and cut!
That's a deep gash!!
BLOOD pours down at a sickening pace.
INT. RINGSIDE
BIANCA'S HEARING AID sharply dips in SOUND as the thunderous
AUDIENCE fades drastically. Her eyes show concern as she
continues to cheer ADONIS on.

INT. RING

ADONIS catches WHEELER with a PERFECTLY STRAIGHT right and
the CHAMP is dropped. ADONIS goes to a neutral corner.

COMMENTATOR #3 (V.O.)
Wheeler has been known to cut but
this is surgery - Down goes
Wheeler!!

COMMENTATOR #1 (0.S.)
What a beautifully timed right
cross - Picture perfect!
INT. AUDIENCE
BUDDY "KING" CHARLES has seen enough and exits.
BUDDY
(to bodyguard)
++. It's done.

INT. RING - WHEELER'S CORNER

The GASH is bad, very nasty. The RING DOCTOR turns to the
referee.
REFEREE waves his arms! "STUNTMAN" WHEELER, distraught,
pounds the ring pad. INCONSOLABLE.

COMMENTATOR #2 (0.S.)
That's it!! It's over!! Adonis
Creed is the new Light Heavyweight
Champion of the World!
INT. RING - CENTER
ROCKY and CORNER pour in.
BIANCA climbs into the ring and hugs ADONIS.

ADONIS goes over to WHEELER and gives him a sportsman-like
pat on the shoulder.

ADONIS faces LIL DUKE, Wheeler's trainer.

ADONIS
Sorry, man -

LIL DUKE
Ain't nothing to be sorry ‘bout -
That's fightin' - You were great,
your pops is smilin' - Yo, I'll get

ya ‘Stang back.

ADONIS smiles, moves to the corner and greets ROCKY and
BIANCA, HUGGING them both.

BIANCA
Oh, baby, I am so proud of you! My
God, you're all good?

ADONIS
»..- All good.

ROCKY smiles.
INT. AUDIENCE

Seated in the cheaper seats ANTHONY applauds and glances
around at the hero worshipping crowd.
CUT TO:

INT. CREED MANSION - NIGHT

MARY ANNE CREED looks incredibly relieved as she applauds.
CUT TO:
INT. RING

ANNOUNCER
- Winner by Technical Knockout and
now, new Light Heavyweight Champion
of the World, Adonis Creed!!

COMMENTATOR #2 stands center ring with ADONIS, ROCKY and
BIANCA.

ADONIS has never smiled so broadly.

COMMENTATOR #2
Well, Adonis, it wasn't an epic
battle, but it was a hell of a beat
down - This is the first time, at
least in the heavier divisions,
that there has ever been father and
son undisputed title holders - Your
thoughts?

ADONIS
I'm blessed with really good people
around me - You came to see
fighting and that's what you always
get with me and more!

COMMENTATOR #2
Now what?

INT. ARENA HALLWAY

ROCKY has a little bag with him, all his fight corner stuff,
swabs, gels. Tape.

ADONIS and BIANCA walk about twenty feet ahead of him.
ROCKY pauses in front of:
WHEELER'S DRESSING ROOM.

WHEELER sits COMPLETELY ALONE on a metal folding chair, eyes
red, tearing. A sad sight.

NO MUSIC. NO REVELERS. He's ALL ALONE except for LIL DUKE,
who packs equipment up. ADONIS steps into view...

ADONIS
++. C'mon, what's up?

ROCKY and WHEELER make eye contact. ROCKY knows all to well
this special pain. He gives a sympathetic nod. ADONIS is
effected by the bleak realities of the dark side of this
sport.

They move off.
INT. SUITE - MGM GRAND

A huge suite back at the MGM GRAND. An ICE SCULPTURE made of
the name "Creed". The PARTY is in full swing. MUSIC. Girls.
Food. They cheer when ADONIS enters the room. ROCKY smiles.
Pulls him close.

ROCKY
You earned it, kid.

Everywhere ADONIS moves, someone has their hands out, as if
reaching for the hem of his garment. We hear SNIPPETS of
overlapping conversation like:

PRODUCER
When you get to LA, I gotta hook
you up with -

Very attractive GIRLS give very suggestive looks as ADONIS
passes through the well-wishers.

FLASHES go off as people take selfies. Some make SNAPS. It's
a frenzy.

ROCKY stands in the corner. PEOPLE around him taking selfies.

ADONIS poses for a selfie with a few HIGH END FANS. He sees a
MAN (ANTHONY), ten years his senior, staring at him.

ADONIS
(to Bianca)
Be right back.

BIANCA
Who's that?

ADONIS
My brother.

ROCKY looks over and notices BIANCA'S confused expression.

BIANCA
Anthony?

ADONIS
Be right back.

ADONIS nods and moves off. This is unexpectedly emotional.
ROCKY goes to BIANCA, they talk.

ADONIS goes up to his BROTHER.

ANTHONY
(energetic)
You looked great, brother, like our
Pops.
ADONIS
Didn't expect to see you, Anthony.

ANTHONY
Well, I was around an' it's ‘bout
time... We're blood and you've done
something great tonight and I've
been acting the fool too long - I'm
real with that, I just had to get
over "myself" - Hasn't been easy
for me, man, the better you do, the
worse I felt about myself. It's
tough for an older brother to feel
like the younger brother, know what
I'm saying?

ADONIS
Mom know you're here?

ANTHONY
"Course, she wants this, too -
Look, man, I'm sorry for the ego
bullshit, it's over, right, I just
want to be part of it again, part
of where you're going, and I bring
something to the party, I've got
angles and ideas. You want me
around? Last time I looked, there
ain't many Creeds left.

ADONIS studies his BROTHER'S almost pleading expression and
they shake.

BIANCA sees the BROTHERS approach.

ADONIS
Bianca, this is Anthony.

BIANCA
Hey, heard a lot about you.

ADONIS
(smiles)
And my "Unc", Rocky, who helps get
me through this.

ANTHONY is a little COOL with ROCKY.

ANTHONY
What's up?

BIANCA
Do you want to go?

ADONIS
Oh, yeah. Catch up with y'all
later.
ANTHONY
Thank you, brother.

They move off.
ANTHONY and ROCKY lock eyes.

ANTHONY (CONT'D)
Remember me? Met me and my sister a
long time back at Pops funeral. Our
sister passed a few years back,
only me and him now - So you the
"White Daddy" runnin' the show?

ROCKY
(offended)
Nobody runs nothin' - Yo, where
were you when he needed somebody?

ANTHONY
(indignant)
- No offense, but we're real blood,
you're not -
(moves off)
Stallion, thanks for taking better
care of him than ya did our Pops...

ANTHONY walks off into the crowd.
INT. BEDROOM - MGM GRAND SUITE - NIGHT

Floor to ceiling windows, with an expansive view of the Las
Vegas Strip.

BIANCA
It's a madhouse out there.

ADONIS
Crazy, right? Let ‘em enjoy it. My
victory's right here.

BIANCA
Your brother just shows up -

ADONIS
Yeah, but hold that conversation
later, it's our time.

They share a kiss. She looks around the room. There's a room
service table with a CHAMPAGNE BUCKET in the middle.

ADONIS (CONT'D)
Look inside.

BIANCA sees TWO PINTS of ICE CREAM inside the bucket.
ADONIS (CONT'D)
Where'd that come from?

ADONIS sits on the bed. Takes his shirt off. Exhausted.
Bianca sits next to him. She takes the chocolate ice cream
with her.

BIANCA
Babe. How do you feel?

ADONIS
What?

BIANCA
Like "Champion of the world"?

ADONIS smiles.

ADONIS
(tongue in cheek)
Nah, I feel empty and sad inside.

ADONIS looks at her and leans back.

ADONIS (CONT'D)
So could ya feed the champ some ice
cream?

BIANCA looks at him.

BIANCA
Excuse me?

ADONIS
C'mon, I've had a rough night.

BIANCA
(smiles)
I had a "rougher" night than you
had tonight.

ADONIS
-.. There's injuries everywhere.

BIANCA
Sure there are.

ADONIS
C'mon, can't you feed your man some
ice cream?

BIANCA

Why don't you get one of those
bimbos out there to do that?
10.

ADONIS
That ice cream looks very good -
Gonna melt soon.

BIANCA shakes her head and opens the pint. She covers her
mouth.

Stuck in the center of the ice cream is a 5 carat DIAMOND
RING.

BIANCA
Oh my God!

ADONIS smiles.

BIANCA (CONT'D)
Donnie.

ADONIS takes the ring out of the ice cream and gets on one
knee.

ADONIS
Bianca -

BIANCA
--. Yes.

BIANCA smiles. Tears in her eyes.
ADONIS
++. Love you, baby, more every

minute.

EXT. ROTTERDAM, NETHERLANDS - NIGHT

 

A dank, cold night on the outskirts of the city.
A DARK SEDAN pulls up to a low-level FIGHT CLUB.

Out of the car steps fight promoter BUDDY "KING" CHARLES and
his BODYGUARD.

INT. BASEMENT

BUDDY is guided past the dank rooms and cubbyholes that serve
as places for fighters to get ready for their matches...
Depressing as it gets. BUDDY passes a half dozen BRAWLERS of
different weights. None are special. A GYM RAT converses with
BUDDY and points to a room at the end of the corridor.

BUDDY approaches a HULKING FIGURE with sharp features
standing in the shadows. The BIG MAN studies another LARGE
YOUNG MAN with a menacing aura, in boxing garb, facing away,
warming up in the corner.
11.

BUDDY
Ivan Arloff?

DRAGO ignores the well-dressed entrepreneur.

DRAGO
».. Who are you?

BUDDY
I have a business proposition might
be interested in.

DRAGO
Who are you?

BUDDY
Buddy "King" Charles, boxing
promotions. I'd like to think
there's a great opportunity for you
both to capitalize on the Drago
name that you and your son haven't
used for years.

DRAGO
What are you talking about?

BUDDY
About you and your name.

The YOUNG FIGHTER continues to warm up, ignoring them.

BUDDY (CONT'D)
I know your history, the "history"
with that family and I know the
public likes a great story and
great stories sell, very simple -

DRAGO looks hard at him.

BUDDY (CONT'D)
You were used, you took the blame
for a man's death when it wasn't
your fault - You basically were
thrown out of your country after
you gave everything you were asked
to give, ashamed to even use your
real name and he, whose real name
is not even Creed, gets glory.

DRAGO

(dryly)
Feel sorry for me?
12.

BUDDY
Of course I do. A man only has his
pride to stand on and I think it's
time for you to get a little
payback - Why should Adonis Creed
come out of nowhere and get all the
acclaim and respect when you and
your son get none? Your son is
tough, I followed his record, tough
fights but no promotion leads no
where. He should be where Creed is,
not here, but on a world stage.
Your son in the ring with the son
of Apollo Creed is more than
boxing, it's an event! Take your
name back - Creed did, now it's
your time to take back what you
lost. What goes around, comes
around. This is an event... A life
changer.

DRAGO glares at him.

DRAGO
Nothin' will change my life - Maybe
his.

BUDDY
Vitor "Drago" - You want to do
this?

VITOR ignores him and exits, heading to the ring.
SMASH CUT:
INT. FIGHT CLUB - NIGHT

BELL RINGS. BUDDY "KING" CHARLES watches VITOR DRAGO rapidly
charge forward and unleash a SAVAGE KICKBOXING beating on his
MIDDLE EASTERN OPPONENT. The low life CROWD screams for
blood. It's FERAL ASSAULT.

VITOR is a vicious predator. BUDDY has never seen such
FEROCITY.

BONE CRUSHING COMBINATIONS batter the opponent helplessly to
the fitly canvas... VITOR mocks the fallen opponent.

BUDDY glances at DRAGO and locks eyes with him. BUDDY's found
a gold mine. VITOR exits and speaks as he passes the
promoter.

VITOR
(to Buddy)
Let's do this.
EXT. VAN NUYS AIRPORT - DAY

The DOOR opens and ADONIS, BIANCA, ANTHONY and ROCKY
down.

ADONIS
Hey, Cali.

ADONIS turns to BIANCA.
ADONIS (CONT'D)
You sure you don't want me to drop
you off?
BIANCA looks at ADONIS.
BIANCA
No, I want them to see and hear me
for me. Not you.
ANTHONY
All right, you go - I'm not,
throwin' shade on you.

ROCKY picks up his bag.

ADONIS
Coming with us, Unc?

ROCKY
Nah - I gotta few things to do.

ADONIS nods.
ADONIS
Cool - Come by the house for

dinner? He's got the address.

ROCKY
Sure, kid.

An ESCALADE pulls up for ADONIS and ANTHONY. Another
Bianca and another one for ROCKY.

ROCKY (CONT'D)
I coulda grabbed a cab.

ADONIS
It's Uber. No one takes cabs
anymore.

ROCKY

See ya's later.

ADONIS shields his eyes as he looks at BIANCA.

13.

step

one for
14.

ADONIS
Can't see you with all that bling.

BIANCA laughs and gets in the car. ANTHONY and ADONIS get in
their SUV.

All pull off in different directions.

EXT. AGENCY - DAY

ADONIS and ANTHONY walk inside the large building people in
Hollywood call The Death Star.

INT. AGENCY

A beautiful view of Century City and a long ass marble table
with bottles of FIJI and FOLDERS that say CREED INC. TREVOR
and JELANI, two handsome, well dressed AGENTS work their
magic.

ADONIS
Nike, we can re-negotiate. Under
Armour wants to do business in a
major way.

ANTHONY
And Reebok and Adidas don't even do
boxing and they just want you too,
right?

JELANI
True.

ADONIS
Sounds good - Creed, Inc. Gyms - 24-
Hour Fitness situations, explore
that?
(to Anthony)
You, too.

ANTHONY
We'll explore it. Oh, yeah - Ever
think about investing in an app?

ANTHONY (CONT'D)
That Silicon money is serious,
brother.

ADONIS smiles.

ADONIS
I've thought of a lot of things -
I'm gonna have my brother get
involved in the day-to-day
operations, so when something has
potential, reach out to him.
(MORE)
15.

ADONIS (CONT'D)
I have three fights I want,
including the rematch, which won't
be a long way off - And I've got a
lot on my mind and I think it's
relatable, so I want to get
involved in public speaking, online
education - I want to get a message
out, goals and dignity and how to
pursue both - Sound like a mouthful
but I mean it. First topic: "Life's
a fight everyone has to fight."

While he speaks, we see ANTHONY'S eyes flash with envy.

ANTHONY
(laughs)
When are you going to sleep?

EXT. APPLE OFFICE - SANTA MONICA - DAY

We're outside the offices of what has become the world's
largest record company.

AVA FISHER (0.S.)
Your voice is sexy - It pulls you
in.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

BIANCA is sitting across from AVA FISHER, a record executive.
Two ASSISTANTS are present.

BIANCA'S MUSIC is playing. Her newest composition. Everyone
is liking it a great deal. AVA smiles at her ASSISTANTS, who
nod back. BIANCA looks encouraged. The song is wonderful and
loud.

The SOUND begins to FADE in BIANCA'S EARS. She subtly touches
her hidden HEARING AIDS. The music gets lower and she tries
to SUPPRESS her fear. Her nails dig into her palms.

The SOUND slowly begins to ebb back and BIANCA puts on a
brave face. The music ends and so does the emotional roller
coaster.

BIANCA
You want to sign me?

AVA FISHER
I don't do general meetings, I only
do business and we want to be in
business with you, love that Philly
thing you got going - Sexy.

BIANCA is silent.
16.

AVA FISHER (CONT'D)
You're not excited.

BIANCA
I am - Excuse me.

She nonchalantly removes one of her hearing aids.

BIANCA (CONT'D)
"Show time" - The battery's dying -
I don't hide it, I just deal with
it -

AVA and the JUNIOR EXECS are taken aback. BIANCA begins to
insert the battery.

BIANCA (CONT'D)
I could feel them going down in
Vegas. The higher frequencies are
the first to go. Imagine hearing
someone arguing on the other side
of this wall. You hear the voice
but can't understand the words.

The battery is in and she replaces the hearing aid.

BIANCA (CONT'D)
(smiles)
All better - Still interested?

AVA FISHER

... Of course we're interested - I
want you on the road, performing
your songs - First we'll set up a
showcase in Philadelphia then bring
down the major label exec's from
New York to hear the 'new' Philly
sound, they'll love it, trust me.

BIANCA
Sound great - Y'know, I'm pregnant.

AVA FISHER
(smiles)
She's just full of surprises.
EXT. HOLLYWOOD CEMETERY - DAY

ROCKY walks up to APOLLO CREED'S HEADSTONE which is quite
elaborate.
17.

ROCKY
».- So, long time, friend - Hard to
believe you're right here and I
can't see ya - It's like
everybody's goin' someplace - Yo,
ya kid's doing good - Very good,
not as good as you yet, maybe
never. Ya don't know how good ya
are until ya think ya starin' at
angels, right?.. I'm suppose to go
to ya house, but I don't wanna... I
brought ya these.

He pulls out a pair of ADONIS'S BOXING GLOVES.

ROCKY (CONT'D)
Ya kid won the title in them. I'm
gonna leave ‘em. I know somebody
will steal 'em but I thought ya be
proud.

He hangs the gloves over the headstone.

ROCKY (CONT'D)
++. Looks nice.

EXT. CREED MANSION - NIGHT
The UBER pulls up and ROCKY exits.

He looks anxious... Out front is the BLACK MUSTANG that
ADONIS won back.

The front door opens and MARY ANNE CREED steps out. Her
expression is hard to read... The car leaves.

MARY ANNE
Hello, Rocky.

ROCKY
(nervous)
How ya doin' Mary Anne?

MARY ANNE
++. I heard you were coming.

ROCKY
(awkwardly)
Yeah, Adonis, he said I should come
over - Is it okay?

A moment of silence.
MARY ANNE

Of course - Would you like to come
in?
18.

ROCKY
++. Sure.

INT. CREED TROPHY ROOM

MARY ANNE has a drink and walks into the dramatically lit
room.

Cases of trophies and at least TEN DIFFERENT championship
belts.

Several large dramatically lit photos of assorted title
FIGHTS.

MARY ANNE
++. This is like a museum. I don't
know why I keep all this around -
Not exactly a feel good room. Do
you keep old things, too?

ROCKY is incredibly uncomfortable.

ROCKY
Few things - the restaurant.

MARY ANNE
People like seeing it, don't they?
Talking about the good old days.

ROCKY
(very uncomfortable)
Sorta - We're not so busy...
Y'know, I shoulda called ya more.

MARY ANNE
Nobody's blaming you.

ROCKY
Me - I'm blamin' me... Sorry I
didn't stay in touch.

(shrugs)
MARY ANNE
And say what? Apollo was his own
man.
ROCKY

(looks moved)
If I could turn the clock back...

MARY ANNE
The clock stopped the day you let
him take your place. I was there.

ROCKY
I know -
19.

MARY ANNE
++. You loved your wife?

ROCKY
++. Course.

MARY ANNE
And you got to spend many years
with her, the way it is suppose to
be. What if that never happened, it
would have been hard.

ROCKY
oe. Very.

MARY ANNE
Apollo was not perfect and what
happened, but he loved you,
respected you and now here we are
again. I know he came to you and
all I ask is to never let something
happen again, because he will push
it an' push it, like his father. He
can't help it -

ROCKY stares at the floor.
MARY ANNE (CONT'D)
I'm over accusing, the blaming,
does no good anymore, but what if
it happens to him... Because it
could. You had one man die in your
hands, what will you say?

ROCKY
++. I love your son.

ROCKY stares deep into MARY ANNE'S eyes, pondering the
moment.

EXT. UNION STATION
A CAB pulls up and ROCKY exits with his bags.
INT. UNION STATION

ROCKY'S image is dwarfed by the high-beamed Spanish
concourse.

EXT. CREED MANSION - NIGHT

A black ESCALADE pulls up and ADONIS, ANTHONY and BIANCA step
out.

ADONIS sees the Mustang, elated.
20.

ADONIS
My 'Stang's back.

ANTHONY
I called Lil Duke an' said, your
man got whipped good, so now show
some class an' give back my little
brother's ride back fast.

Heading into the house, BIANCA eyes him.
INT. CREED MANSION

ADONIS, BIANCA and ANTHONY enter.

MARY ANNE greets them.

MARY ANNE
Welcome - Welcome! Before I say any
more to you boys, I need to hug
this young lady. Congratulations,
how do you feel?

She hugs BIANCA.

BIANCA
Wonderful.

MARY ANNE
You look beautiful.
(to Anthony)
Glad you two worked things out -
It's important.

ADONIS
Rocky's coming by soon.

MARY ANNE
He did, but he left.

ADONIS
Left? Was there a problem?

MARY ANNE
No, he just said he wanted to go
home.

ANTHONY

(walking off)
Man's got a restaurant to run.

ADONIS
We were supposed to be celebrating.
He helped make everythin' happen.
21.

BIANCA
You helped him just as much.

ADONIS reflects.

BIANCA (CONT'D)
He'll be fine... Baby, we got to be
concentrating on our lives now.

MARY ANNE
».. Dinner's about ready.

ADONIS still troubled by the departure, nods and enters.
ANTHONY reappears by the door.

ANTHONY
+. Check out what's on TV - Hurry
up.

EXT. CREED MANSION - LIVING ROOM

ADONIS steps closer to the LARGE SCREEN TV. BIANCA and MARY
ANNE are on the sofa. ANTHONY is standing behind ADONIS.

SPORTSCASTER (ON TV)
Maybe one of the most hated men in
boxing history! Living in near
seclusion, the former Russian super
fighter, who was formally defeated
by American boxer Rocky Balboa in
1986, is back in the picture with
his son, also a heavyweight who has
been fighting under a different
family name for many years... Why?
Why come out of the "shadows" now?

BUDDY (ON TV)
Drago feels this "young" Creed has
a life he does not deserve, did not
earn.

ADONIS
(to Anthony)
This man's a thief - He's been
trying to promote me.

ANTHONY takes this in.
SPORTSCASTER (ON TV)
Why would you want to open old

wounds?

DRAGO (ON TV)
They never closed.

Drago and Vitor remain silent.
SPORTSCASTER (ON TV)
Are you haunted by the former
champion's death?

DRAGO (ON TV)
- Not at all.

SPORTSCASTER (ON TV)
You feel no responsibility?

DRAGO (ON TV)
».. It was fight. He lost, what
more is to say?

DRAGO stares emotionless at the crowd and interviewer.

DRAGO (ON TV) (CONT'D)
I was a great fighter and I had to
leave my country like a dog -
Politics - I live in other
countries like a dog, ashamed of my
name, my son had to live like this,
too -

SPORTSCASTER (ON TV)
So do you want revenge through your
son?

VITOR (ON TV)
We want what is owed.

SPORTSCASTER (ON TV)
What exactly do you think you're
owed?

VITOR (ON TV)
Everything - What they have - What
is fair.

SPORTSCASTER (ON TV)
And what are your feelings about
Balboa, since it was your fight?

DRAGO (ON TV)
I don't want to talk about him.

BIANCA
Why are we watching this?

MARY ANNE exits the room. ADONIS turns it off.

ANTHONY
That old man an' his punk are
calling you out! You gotta answer
back.

22.
23.

BIANCA
Why?

ANTHONY
Why?

SPORTSCASTER (ON TV)
So what is it exactly you want?

DRAGO (ON TV)
They bring me to this country,
dishonor me -

SPORTSCASTER (ON TV)
Dishonor? Apollo is the one who
died.

DRAGO (ON TV)
Not my fault - He was not strong
enough.

BIANCA
Turn it off - It's a stupid
publicity stunt, money grab.

ANTHONY
So what? It's an amazing
opportunity. D, you would tear the
muscle-bound punk up - Bullshit
kickboxer, what's that? You'd mess
him up and make a statement, man,
and the money. Creed Inc. He's a
bum, no skills, brother.

BUDDY (ON TV)

Drago's son deserves some respect -
Life is supposed to give second
chances - This man has lived a real
life, Adonis Creed took the easy
route. He got a break he didn't
deserve. If his father didn't break
down barriers, if he wasn't a real
warrior, Adonis Creed would not
exist. Without "the name" who is
he, really?

ANTHONY
C'mon, D - Let's do this.

ADONIS rises and exits.
24.

BIANCA
(exiting)
I'm asking you nicely to stop
pushing this, understand me - Don't
mess with our lives, mess with your
own.

ANTHONY
-+. He should do it.

ADONIS keeps going, incensed.
EXT. TRAIN - NIGHT

The MOON is rising as the PASSENGER TRAIN rumbles down the
track.

INT. TRAIN - NIGHT

ROCKY sits alone, staring out into the DARKNESS whipping
past. There are only TEN PASSENGERS in the club car.

A YOUNGER COUPLE is watching a movie on an iPad. An older,
sleeping HISPANIC WOMAN sits across the AISLE from ROCKY.

ROCKY opens his OLD FASHIONED WALLET and pulls out a PLASTIC
ACCORDION 10-PICTURE HOLDER and stares at the small PHOTOS
from his past: ADRIAN, MICKEY, ROBERT, HIS DOG, PAULIE,
infant shots, etc.

INT. CREED MANSION - NIGHT

ADONIS sits in the DEN watching FOOTAGE of his FATHER'S
FIGHT. He studies the grand images closely. The FOOTAGE is of
DRAGO beating APOLLO. He switches to his OWN PERSONAL FIGHTS.
We see ADONIS beating a half dozen opponents... ANTHONY
enters.

He PACES in front of ADONIS. He holds up his IPAD.

ANTHONY
This shit is trending already - You
didn't start this but you can
finish it, you should. It's a
chance to throw down, make a
statement, everything's on your
side and I want to contribute, be
part of it. You got a chance to do
something big. This fight would
make "the statement", son of the
greatest boxer ever -

This word "ever" digs at ADONIS.

ANTHONY (CONT'D)
- Against the man who beat the life
out of him.

(MORE)
25.

ANTHONY (CONT'D)
Besides being the "right" thing to
do, ya got a family on the way,
this is "generational" money. Pops
would say do it for your family,
for that kind of cash, he'd come
back from the dead - I know you'll
beat this big punk easy, he's got
no real skills - If I had what you
had I'd be on it tomorrow.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

ADONIS is alone in his MUSTANG. Driving nowhere in
particular. He is lost in THOUGHT. HIP HOP MUSIC drifts from
the radio... He turns if OFF and stares out into the night.
EXT. EUROPE - EARLY MORNING

It is cool, miserable, misty weather.

We see VITOR DRAGO jogging in a crappy, mostly deserted, old
INDUSTRIAL SECTION of town.

His hood is pulled tight as SWEAT and RAIN pour down his
face. He looks menacing.

Following close behind is IVAN DRAGO. His countenance is
cold, pitiless.

He flashes the LIGHTS indicating to pick up the pace.

VITOR does not. IVAN BLASTS THE HORN! Still, VITOR remains
defiant.

IVAN brings the car closer, so close in fact, that he nearly
brushes up against the back of his son's legs.

VITOR suddenly leaps to the side and POUNDS THE HOOD with a
hammer fist.

IVAN SLAMS ON THE BRAKES and slowly gets out. He matches his
son's seething stare.

DRAGO
(in Russian)

Run - You are me - I am you.

The only sound is the monotonous rain as the smoldering
tension subsides as VITOR peels off and continues running.

IVAN stares at the retreating figure.
EXT. CLUB - ROTTERDAM - NIGHT

On this COLD, MISTY night, HOUSE MUSIC thumps out of the
successful club as people arrive.
26.

Out front is VITOR who is HEAD OF SECURITY... Dressed warmly,
he decides who gets in and who doesn't.

Two high PUNKS in their early twenties try to get in. VITOR
menacingly gestures that they better get out of there.
Intimidated, they move on. VITOR is a hard man.

EXT. PENN STATION - PHILADELPHIA - DAY

A WIDE SHOT of the historic building.

ROCKY holding his SUITCASE is seen exiting the station.
EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY

INT. HOSPITAL - EXAM ROOM - CONTINUOUS

ROCKY is with the FEMALE DOCTOR who has treated him for the
past two years. She scans a REPORT.

ROCKY
Any good news in there?

DOCTOR

Yes - The good news is the lymphoma
is in remission.

ROCKY
Reversed?

DOCTOR
You could say that.

ROCKY
So I'm gonna be around a while?

DOCTOR
(smiles)

If the signs and symptoms stay
reduced and remain that way for at
least five years, you're pretty
much disease- free. Of course, you
must keep up with the prescriptions
- But things are looking good.

ROCKY gives a slight pensive smile.

ROCKY

Fantastic, really, my kid's coming
to visit with my grandson for the
holidays, been like forever - Now I
got some good news to talk about
for a change.

(vises)
Yo, Doc, thanks, you did great.
27.
EXT. JET TERMINAL - NIGHT

ADONIS exits the terminal with BIANCA and ANTHONY plus
AIRPORT CURBSIDE PERSONNEL. Several VIDEO FILM CREWS and
PAPARAZZI with their IPHONES recording are there as they head
straight to the waiting SUVS.

REPORTER #1
Adonis, Bianca - Is it good to be
back home?

BIANCA
Always.

REPORTER #2
Are you fighting Drago's son?

ADONIS
Don't believe everything you hear.

REPORTER #3
But he's calling you out, isn't he?

ANTHONY

He's just a big bum with a big
mouth.

REPORTER #1
So who's next?

ADONIS
Bianca's singing tomorrow, don't
miss it. That'll be better than any
of my fights!

EXT. ROCKY/MICKEY'S GYM - DAY

FISHTOWN. Rocky's hellhole neighborhood. Several CONSTRUCTION
TRUCKS are outside.

ROCKY enters. Several FIGHTERS, mostly young, are training...
The place has been brought almost back to the way it was in
the beginning. The co-owner from Creed - PETE - is present.

ROCKY
Good job - I like it the old way.

PETE
But who's comin' to this
neighborhood? Hey, is your guy
doin' it on or not?

ROCKY
Doin' what?
28.

PETE

Fightin' Drago's kid. Where you
been?

ROCKY

On a train.

PETE

They're talking about Adonis
fighting Drago's kid, not a bad
idea, guy's muscle bound, easy day
at office.

ROCKY

».. Nothin' easy.

PETE

When it happens, I want my kid on
the card, okay?

ROCKY exits.

EXT. ADONIS

An SUV with

enter. BIANCA is beautifully dressed.

pulls into view. He exits.

ROCKY

How ya doin' - Glad I caught ya -

(to Bianca)

Ya look beautiful.

BIANCA

Thank you - Everything all right?

ROCKY

Yeah, I gotta ask ya something
about trainin' -

ADONIS

Okay, she's singing tonight -
What's the problem?

BIANCA enters. ANTHONY holds back.

I

ROCKY
heard about you and Drago's kid -

That's not real, right? Somebody's
goofin'.

ADONIS

They think it's real.
29.

ROCKY
Is it real for you? You said what?
No, right?

ADONIS
I didn't say anything.

ANTHONY
You'll walk through him - That's an
event.

ROCKY
You don't know what ya talkin'
about -

ADONIS

No, it's just talk -

ROCKY
Ya a real fighter - It's beneath
you -

ADONIS

Beneath me? Maybe, but you did it.

ROCKY
Different - Different reasons -
Truth is, there's pieces I still
haven't found - It's not worth it.
If ya care about what I think,
please, move on -

ADONIS
Okay, got it - She's gonna be late.

ROCKY
Sorry - Good luck, Bianca - So, I
can breathe easy?

ADONIS smiles.

ADONIS
Yeah, you can breathe easy.

ANTHONY
You're making such a big deal out
of this -

ROCKY

(ignores him)
».. Thanks. See ya at the gym.

ADONIS exits.
30.
INT. MUSIC VENUE - PHILADELPHIA - NIGHT

BIANCA performs the song we watched her compose during the
Adonis montage.

ADONIS watches her all lit up and glowing. She is beautiful.
ANTHONY, arriving late, positions himself near the stage.

Music executive AVA FISHER looks on with her BOSS and
ASSISTANTS.

As BIANCA reaches the bridge of the song, suddenly the blood
drains from Bianca's face even though she's still singing and
smiling.

FROM BIANCA'S POV her hearing FADES and COMES and GOES. She
touches her EARPIECE.

BIANCA
(while singing)
+... Sorry, little off tonight.

ADONIS watches her with mounting disappointment. The AUDIENCE
is MUTTERING.

BIANCA finishes to courteous applause and she goes off stage.
AVA scans the patrons. Her BOSS says something negative to
her and leaves.

ADONIS hugs BIANCA.

BIANCA (CONT'D)
What did I just do?

ADONIS
It was beautiful, baby. Believe it.

ANTHONY approaches.

ANTHONY
I'll give it to you - That was
strong.

BIANCA
(to Ava)
Sorry -

AVA FISHER
(double-talk)
Well, it was good, but a little
bumpy. You handled it beautifully.

BIANCA
Thanks - Is everything still on?
31.

AVA FISHER
I don't think so.

BIANCA
It was a malfunction - Won't happen
again.

AVA FISHER
I'm sure. We'll be in touch.

BIANCA
Thanks.

AVA FISHER moves off.

BIANCA (CONT'D)
That's it. They're not calling.

ADONIS
Don't say that.

BIANCA
Be real, okay - It's done.

A DJ plays music. FANS and CELEBRITIES as well as all the
rest of the WANNABES and DEMO HUSTLERS that come to showcases
looking for an angle, are moving to the beat.

BIANCA (CONT'D)
Let's go, please.

The MUSIC abruptly stops.

TONE TRUMP (0.S.)
Tone Trump in the house!!

ADONIS and BIANCA look at each other and then look up and see
that

TONE TRUMP
The RAPPER that Adonis skirmished with, has taken the stage.

TONE TRUMP (CONT'D)
Lots of stars from Philly made it
big.

TONE TRUMP (CONT'D)
Kobe Bryant, I'll give props to
Will Smith. I'll even give it up to
my idol growing up, Apollo Creed.
But Baby Creed? He can eat a dick.
In fact, he can swallow my Johnson.
That's his name. Johnson?
32.

Cheers and boos from the crowd. Eyes are on ADONIS and
BIANCA. ANTHONY checks out ADONIS'S REACTIONS. Cameras (and
cell phone flashes) go off.

TONE TRUMP (CONT'D)
I see you, Baby Creed. Wrote a song
about you. Yo, anybody want to hear
my song?

CHEERS.

A BEAT DROPS... and I hate to say it, but the beat is FIRE.
And TONE starts rapping ABOUT ADONIS and DRAGO.

Like Ice Cube's "No Vaseline" or Jay-Z's "Takeover" this may
be a diss track, but it's dope.

BIANCA
Don't - D, let's go. Hell with
this.

ADONIS

(to Tone)

You and your bitch crew, c'mon,

bring it.
But then TONE starts rapping about this:

TONE TRUMP

«+. Deaf bitch from around the

way...
ADONIS heads for the STAGE!
FLASHES go off. ANTHONY and SECURITY pull him back.

BIANCA
D, no! He's a pig!

ANTHONY
Nah, man, not here. Let's go.

ADONIS
Let's handle this shit right now.

TONE TRUMP, with GLEE, goes back to rapping about how YOUNG
DRAGO would kick Adonis's ass.

TONE TRUMP
"Either one. Father or son. Done is
done."

Everyone's recording with their phones.

SECURITY quickly ushers ADONIS and BIANCA out of the club.
33.

INT. SUBURBAN - NIGHT

Speeding down Broad Street. Nothing but silence and tight
jaws in the car.

ADONIS looks at his IPHONE X. The footage of the diss and his
freakout are everywhere. MediaTakeOut. Worldtar. Instagram.

ADONIS
I gotta know who set this up,
‘cause this shit's not by accident!

ANTHONY
The label probably set this up.

BIANCA
What?!

ANTHONY
Yeah, if thing's didn't go
sideways, this would've been great
hype.

ADONIS stares at his hands for a moment.

ADONIS
(calmly)
I'm taking the Drago fight.

ANTHONY
Now you're being smart.

BIANCA
It's not "smart".

ANTHONY
Why's he in the game then? Easiest
money you'll ever make, c'mon,
Bianca.

BIANCA
(to Anthony)
I want to go somewhere alone with
him, you mind?

ANTHONY
Drop me off.

EXT. BIANCA'S FORMER APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

An S.U.V. pulls up to the weathered apartment building and
ADONIS and BIANCA exit.

ADONIS looks at the building.
34.

ADONIS
Why're we here?

BIANCA
Do you remember that the first
words you had with me in this
building was a complaint?

ADONIS
Yeah, you were noisy.

BIANCA
And I remember when I looked down
from that window that I almost fell
out of because you were so damn
handsome - I loved you at first
sight and it's only gotten
stronger. Nobody is going to love
you more than me, except the child
I'm carrying. Do you really want to
bring the "past" into our life?
Really? When you don't have to? We
got so much ahead - Let's make our
own history, not old history. Raise
a family the way we wished we were
raised - You don't need this, "we"
don't need this - Move on, D, if I
can give up something that I wanted
my whole life, you can sacrifice a
little, too. I believe you can do
anything, but I don't want you to
do this.

ADONIS
What kind of man just walks away?

BIANCA
A man who loves something more than
himself...
ADONIS PACES then goes up to BIANCA, hugs her.
EXT. ADRIAN'S RESTAURANT - NIGHT
A slight glow from the NEON SIGN indicates the joint is open.

INT. ADRIAN'S RESTAURANT

The place is half full. ROCKY is at the front, greeting the
few customers and reading a DOGEARED novel.

Over the bar is an inexpensive paper BANNER that reads
“WELCOME BACK HOME!"

BIG SPIDER is behind the bar, blankly watching TV. ROCKY is
making small talk and glancing out of the window.
35.
SPIDER sees the INTERVIEW, the same one with DRAGO and son.

SPIDER
(to Rocky)
Hey -

He gestures to the TV. ROCKY comes over, sees DRAGO. His
HEART drops. He TURNS it up.

DRAGO (ON TV)
I was a great fighter and I had to
leave my country like a dog.

Outside, a TAXI pulls up and ROBERT BALBOA, JR. steps out
with his son, 8-year-old LOGAN. ROCKY sees the TAXI and turns
OFF the INTERVIEW and dashes outside.

ROCKY
Yo, finally! Ya's look great.

He hugs ROBERT. Faces the child.

ROCKY (CONT'D)
Hey, there, Logan - Wow, did he
grow.

ROBERT
Yeah -

ROCKY
C'mon inside, it's a nasty cold
night - So glad ya's made it!

They enter.

ROCKY (CONT'D)
(to Spider)
Give 'em a hand with the bags,
okay?

SPIDER exits.

ROCKY hugs his son again and turns to LOGAN. ROBERT looks to
the SIGN.

ROBERT
You didn't need to do that.

ROCKY
(laughs)
- Course I did.
36.

ROBERT
Well, thanks, it's getting late,
he's tired, actually, I'm tired
too, so we better get to a hotel.
Just wanted to stop by and say hi
first.

ROCKY

No hotel, I'd love ya to stay with
me - I'm right here, upstairs,
there's plenty of room. Please come
on, bought new sheets an'
everything.

(to Logan)
Wanna see somethin' kinda rare?

INT. ADRIAN'S RESTAURANT - UPSTAIRS

ROCKY carries one suitcase and ROBERT carries the other as
they climb the narrow, dark old stairs.

ROCKY
This is all ya's brought?

ROBERT
It's enough.

Though they try hard NOT to show it, ROBERT and LOGAN are
taken aback by the tight, hundred-year-old accommodations.
It's a TIME WARP.

ROCKY
The joint's old, but don't leak
much - Check this out.

ROCKY goes to the BRAND NEW, modern, colorful AQUARIUM. It is
by far the NICEST OBJECT in the room.

In THE TANK are his pet TURTLES.

ROCKY (CONT'D)
Wake up! Ya got good company - This
is "Cuff" and his friend speedin'
around in there is "Link". I've had
these bums for over 40 years.

(to Robert)
Right?

ROBERT
Yeah - My whole life.

ROCKY
They're walkin' rocks, but nice -
Yo, thanks for comin' - We'll have

some fun.
37.
EXT. PHILADELPHIA - AIRPORT - NIGHT

DRAGO, VITOR and BUDDY "KING" CHARLES exit the building...
They are guided them towards two waiting SUVs by a BODYGUARD.

EXT. MUSEUM - NIGHT

The camera pans down to find DRAGO and his SON near the base
of the ROCKY STATUE: pure, cold hatred pours from Drago's
eyes.

Seated in the SECOND SUV is BUDDY "KING" CHARLES who is on
the phone...

DRAGO SPITS and LOCKS EYES with his son, then peels off to
the SUV, followed by VITOR.

INT. ADONIS'S CONDO - NIGHT
ADONIS lays in bed. The NIGHTLY NEWSCAST is on TV.
BIANCA practices her music in the other room on the piano.

ADONIS ignores the TV as he stares at an IPAD in his hand. He
is watching a VIDEO ON SIGN LANGUAGE FOR THE DEAF. He
IMITATES some of the basic HAND GESTURES.

SPORTSCASTER #1 (0.S.)
++. That covers the NBA - At the
moment now for boxing, newly
crowned Light Heavyweight champ,
Adonis Creed has agreed to a
rematch with the unlucky "Stuntman"
Wheeler.

"Stuntman" Wheeler appears on camera. ADONIS glances up, then
back to the IPAD.

WHEELER (0.S.)
It was just a freak accident - Wait
‘til next time.

ADONIS puts away the IPAD and steps into the other room.

SPORTSCASTER #1 (0.S.)
+... The top contender was stopped
in the first round in what was a
very unpopular performance.

ADONIS studies BIANCA almost serenely writing lyrics while
tapping the piano's keys. Her HEARING AIDS are on the piano.

ADONIS
What are you working on?
38.

She does not hear him. His HEART breaks. He goes to her.
Seeing him approach, she puts in the hearing aids and softly
smiles.

BIANCA
+.. These are a slight improvement.

ADONIS
What've you been up to?

BIANCA
Writing lyrics.

ADONIS
Can I read them?

BIANCA
«+. Go ahead.

ADONIS
- I like this line.

BIANCA

+. Really? Are you just saying
that?

C.U. LINE:
"How much can you take when you can't take no more..."

ADONIS
I like it - Sounds like a fight
song - Very nice.

He kisses her and she carries on.

ADONIS (CONT'D)
».. I may have to steal it.

BIANCA starts to write.

ADONIS (CONT'D)
(into her eyes)

++. I told you I'll let it go, but
I want to be a good man and a good
father and I can only do that if I
feel good about myself - If
something changes, I need you to be
with me and believe in me... I need
that.

BIANCA touches his face and she continues to write.
INT. OFFICE - NIGHT

BUDDY "KING" CHARLES sits behind his elaborate modern desk.
39.

DRAGO and VITOR grimly watch a SPORTS BROADCAST of the

announcement of the WHEELER/CREED rematch.

DRAGO faces BUDDY, who just GESTURES with his
all going to be all right.

EXT. ROCKY'S GYM - DAY

ROCKY stands with LOGAN and ROBERT outside of
that is being restored.

LOGAN
They're knockin' everything down.

ROCKY
Yeah, they been busy, but I'm
keepin' this joint.
(to Robert)
Ya dad spent a lot of hours here,
didn't ya?

ROBERT
Long time ago - Why restore this
place? The neighborhood is gone.

ROCKY
But I ain't -

LOGAN
That where you learned to fight?

ROCKY
Yeah, did a little smackin' in
there - Pain's a good coach.

Points to the pet shop.

ROCKY (CONT'D)

Met ya amazin' mother an' ya
grandmother over there - It was
fun.

ROBERT
Should we go inside.

ROCKY
Okay -

LOGAN
Can you teach me to fight?

ROCKY
Have to ask ya father about that.

ROBERT
I don't think so.

hand that it's

the old gym
40.

LOGAN
I'd like to try,

ROBERT
There's no upside to getting hit in
the head when you don't have to.

ROCKY is slightly offended but brushes it off.

ROCKY
Nah, one punchin' bag per family is
enough.

ROBERT

I wasn't trying to insult you.

ROCKY
-.. It's okay, I think it's funny.

They all enter.
INT. ROCKY'S GYM - DAY

ADONIS is now working with PADMAN in the ring. TWENTY OTHER
BOXERS are present. Place is PACKED with FANS, HANGERS-ON,
PUNCH-DRUNK PUGS, you name it.

ROCKY looks at the CLOCK.

ROCKY
Keep it goin' - Get all that pizza
out of ya -

ADONIS
(punching)
Love that pizza!!

ROCKY
30 seconds.

ROBERT and LOGAN are present. ROBERT feels out of place. This
is like a FLASHBACK of his life. As ROCKY watches ADONIS with
real concern, ROBERT feels a twinge of JEALOUSY.

ROBERT
So how long have you been training
him?

Throughout, ROCKY NEVER TAKES HIS EYES OFF ADONIS.

ROCKY
Two and a half years -
(to Adonis)
Don't square up, wider stance!
ADONIS
(still working)
Love that pizza!

ROCKY
(eyes on Adonis)
Logan, ya wanna learn to do that?

LOGAN
Sure.

ROBERT
How long you think you'll want to
do this?

ROCKY

(watching only Adonis)
As long as he wants me - Logan, ya
father use to move good, too.

ROBERT
- Not really.

ROCKY
No, ya moved pretty good.

ROBERT
Until I quit.

ROCKY
Ya had school stuff -
(to Adonis)
Time!

BELL RINGS.
ROBERT
Can I see you alone? Logan, come
on.
He heads outside.
ROCKY
(senses something)

Sure.

EXT. GYM - DAY

FATHER and SON and LOGAN step into the biting cold.

senses something is amiss.

ROCKY
(to Logan)
'Nippy' out here.

41.

ROCKY
42.
ROCKY (CONT'D)
++. There's a goofy word, 'nippy' -
Who made that up?

ROBERT
+.. Yeah. Logan, could you please
wait in the car.

LOGAN
Why?

ROBERT
It's cold.

LOGAN gets into the rental car.
FATHER and SON drift into an alley way.

ROBERT (CONT'D)
You know I love you.

ROCKY
Love you, too.

ROBERT
You know what's really special
about you?

ROCKY
Special? Not really.

ROBERT
You're like a season that never
changes.

ROCKY
(at a loss)
».. Wow - Is that a good thing?

ROBERT
For what you 'did' and 'do' it's a
plus - Outside the ring, I don't
know.

ROCKY shifts uneasily.
ROBERT (CONT'D)
Ever see the way you look at him,

at Adonis?

ROCKY
How?

ROBERT
Like he's part of you.
44.

43.

ROCKY
No, just looks that way, maybe -
You're my only son.

ROBERT
I know, but face it, I couldn't
live up to whatever makes you
"you", maybe he can, but I don't
want my kid going through that.
Growing up was tough enough without
him being in your "shadow", too.

ROCKY
My shadow's gone - I'm old.

ROBERT
It's never gone - Y'know, I tried
to get your attention all the time,
an' I even tried fighting, but I
wasn't very good, so I stopped
trying, and you know what you said?

ROCKY
».. I forget sometimes.

ROBERT
You said "Don't worry about it. You
can't be better than you are".

ROCKY
It's just words.

ROBERT
Yeah, but did I need to hear it?
Not living up to what you are,
that's a tough pill to swallow.

ROCKY
Just be "you", how hard is that?

ROBERT
Try telling that to other people.
It's not so easy living with this
name.

ROCKY
Could be harder livin' without it.

ROBERT
You just live in a different world.

ROCKY
(shrugs)
«+. Yeah.
44,

ROBERT
It's harder to make it now.

ROCKY
Well, it was never easy, son -
Y'know, I think maybe, when things
have gotten a little too hard for
you, you looked around for a soft
spot to lay down.

ROBERT
You're calling me a quitter now -
It's all right, Adonis would never
quit, would he?

ROCKY
He's someone else's son - You're my
only - One hundred percent,
everything I could do, I did for
you and ya beautiful mother, I even
didn't mind takin' a beatin' so so
ya could have nice things - I
thought I did pretty good.

ROBERT
Yes, you did, but you expected so
much —-

ROCKY

What? Maybe a "thanks" now and then

ROBERT
I could never live up to what you
wanted.

ROCKY

I never thought I was ya
competition, just ya father.

ROBERT
Fathers and son, it can't be helped
- It's the way it is.

ROCKY
Don't have to be.

ROBERT
It's the way it is, you don't get
that.

ROCKY

I don't wanna get it.
45.%*

ROCKY studies his old, battered fist.
45.

ROCKY (CONT'D)
I'm never seein' ya again, aml...
It's okay, don't answer - I don't
wanna know, ‘cause then maybe
anythin' can happen, right?

ROBERT
«+. Yeah.

ROCKY
Y'know, it's sad, each of us thinks
we're right an' the other is wrong
an' the truth is flyin' around
somewhere - If I could be somebody
else an' make things good between
us, I'd jump in but I'm just this -
Y'know, I never lied to a friend,
never hurt nobody who didn't
deserve it -

ROCKY steps a few PACES forward.
ROCKY (CONT'D)
An' I only gave you the best I
could ever give until I had nothin'
left.
ROCKY pauses, points to the gym.
ROCKY (CONT'D)
(gestures toward the gym)
Gotta go... They need me in there -

He starts to move off.

ROCKY (CONT'D)
».. Please visit ya mother before
ya go.

ROBERT nods and moves away. He enters the car. ROCKY steps
into view.

LOGAN puts his hand up in a BOXING POSE. ROCKY does likewise.
The vehicle pulls away. The sound of a pounding SPEED BAG
swells.

INT. GYM - DAY

A LATINO MIDDLEWEIGHT FIGHTER pounds away on the SPEED BAG.

The AURA in the gum is dark, joyless... Something is in the
air.

The other TWENTY FIGHTERS work on various pieces of
equipment.

A group of ON-LOOKERS sit along the three tier benches.
46.
ADONIS works out with the punch mitts held by PADMAN.
ROCKY labors up the stairs, thoroughly discouraged.

As he pauses to collect his thoughts, ANTHONY arrives and
energetically ascends the steps.

ANTHONY
(passing by)
You okay, Stallion?
He angles past.
ANTHONY sees ADONIS in the ring. He passes.
ANTHONY (CONT'D)
Got two companies bidding for the
ring mat.
He enters the office.
ROCKY wills himself out of the doldrums with each ascending
step. He arrives at the top of the steps, looking like his
old self. He heads toward ADONIS.
ROCKY
(to fighters)
C'mon, let's see some good
sweatin'! Shake an' bake!

ADONIS glances at him while he pounds away. ROCKY seems to be
pushing his enthusiasm a little too hard.

ROCKY (CONT'D)
C'mon, kid - There's nobody better

than you! Hit those things - Go for
it! That's it!

ADONIS hits the PADS with increasing intensity.
EXT. GYM - DAY

TWO BLACK SUVS pull up, followed by LOCAL NEWS VANS and a
T.M.Z.-TYPE ORGANIZATION.

Out step DRAGO and VITOR.
BUDDY "KING" CHARLES climbs out of the second SUV.
INT. GYM STAIRS - DAY

P.O.V. of the NEWS CAMERAS as they follow the men up the
staircase, filming in a documentary style.

IN THE RING:
47.
ROCKY holds a water bottle as ADONIS sips.

ROCKY
I like everything ya doin'. Very
good! But whip them shoulders more -

ROCKY demonstrates the move.

BUDDY (0.S.)
Adonis Creed!

ADONIS pivots towards the voice. BUDDY makes his way forward.
The VIDEO CAMERAS' OPERATORS now swing in front of him.

BUDDY (CONT'D)
You did not respond to my many
calls and invitations, so we
thought we'd publicly drop by -

DRAGO and VITOR clear the steps of the staircase.

ROCKY lays eyes on DRAGO for the first time in over 30 YEARS.
It is very INTENSE.

DRAGO
What're you lookin' at?

ROCKY
Why don't you move?

DRAGO
Make me.

ANTHONY drifts out of the office. He appears anxious.

BUDDY
You fight for money, right, then
keep fighting for it, because you
certainly don't fight for honor!

ADONIS
Better get out of here.

ROCKY
I got this -
(to Drago)
Nobody wants you here.
DRAGO smiles and moves forward.

DRAGO
I do.

ANTHONY looks up at ADONIS.
48.

BUDDY
Adonis, nobody wants to see that
Wheeler re-match. They want
something better - Is this
challenge too much for you, Adonis?

ROCKY leans over to PADMAN and whispers. PADMAN pulls out a
phone.

The other GYM FIGHTERS now CONGREGATE near the front of the
ring, providing a type of buffer zone.

DRAGO
Why are you afraid of my son?

ROCKY
(to Adonis)
Don't talk -

ADONIS
Not afraid of anybody.

BUDDY

Good, because there's the chance to
make things right - You know what
I'm talking about, everyone does.
So take it, what are you waiting
for? You know what this man did to
your father. You can live with
that?

(to Rocky)
Can he?

ROCKY
Why don't you shut your mouth an'
get out.

ADONIS
Yeah, get out.

VITOR
Or what are you gonna do?

ADONIS
(to Buddy)
Control your dog before I whip his
ass.

VITOR
What'd you say?!

ADONIS
(to Buddy)
You heard me.
49,

VITOR
This dog'll kick your ass!

BUDDY
Not yet!
(to Adonis)
When are you going to face this
man?! You just scared? Is he too
big? Rocky fought big men, didn't
you? You weren't afraid.

DRAGO
He is now.

ROCKY
Let's go -

ADONIS starts to exit.

VITOR
The pussy turns his back -

ANTHONY glances over at BUDDY, who nods.

ADONIS
What's your problem man?
(gestures toward Drago)
How much shit you put in his head?

VITOR
Hey, I'm the real nigger here, who
lived like shit when you were
havin' ya ass kissed an' usin' a
name that ain't even yours1l

ADONIS
You know nothin' -

VITOR
Your ol' man fucked up his life,
now I'm gonna fuck up yours!

That does it!! ADONIS CHARGES at VITOR but is held back by
ROCKY, the CORNERMAN and several SPARRING PARTNERS!

Several GYM RATS and BOXERS-IN-TRAINING attempt to stop
VITOR'S forward charge. VITOR RIPS FREE and EASILY SHOVES the
smaller boxers aside. He WAVES AT ADONIS.

VITOR (CONT'D)
Ya shit, boy - You're shit -
Nothing!

DRAGO gets into the brawl, dropping two fighters with a HOOK
and RIGHT HAND. Everyone backs away from the lethal Russian.
50.
The CAMERA CREWS are getting their money's worth.

The POLICE arrive. ADONIS struggles to free himself. POLICE
move forward.

ADONIS looks at BUDDY "KING" CHARLES and steps out of the
ring, heading to the locker room.

ROCKY locks stares with DRAGO, who returns a dead eye
expressions, then exits.

INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY

ROCKY follows ADONIS into the room, followed by ANTHONY.
ADONIS is strangely composed.

ADONIS
Didn't expect that.

ROCKY

What you expect, them to go away?
You said it was over.

ADONIS
That's not happening, even if I
wanted it to.

ROCKY
Thought you didn't want it to.

ADONIS
It's here now, isn't it? Forget
boxing. This is beyond. World wants
this.

ADONIS holds up his IPHONE.

ROCKY
That kid was raised in hate, that's
not how you were.

ADONIS
You think you know all that?

ROCKY
You want revenge, then take it out
on me, ‘cause I'm the reason ya
father ain't here, not him!

ADONIS
You went after him and that was all
good but I want to make it right
and it's all wrong. Do you think
you had more right to do it than
me?
ROCKY and

51.

ROCKY
No, but it don't look like you're
doin' it out of respect for him -
This ain't about defendin' ya
father, ‘cause he had no idea who
ya were, kid. He couldn't pick ya
out of a line up - But years later,
ya this son, defendin' a
relationship that never was - Why?

ANTHONY
You don't need to hear that shit -

ROCKY
Then tell me something different!

ADONIS
Everything I do is to make him
proud. Every time I do something
good, I look up in the sky and say
"Proud yet? Good enough yet?" But
it isn't.

ROCKY
Why do you put that on yourself?

ADONIS
I made this happen.
(pause)
I wanted it to happen.

ANTHONY are stunned.

ANTHONY
You made what happen?

ADONIS
I paid that promoter. I wanted this
to happen... I'm not my father, I'm
using what I have while I have it.
I want to get their real respect,
people not be the victims anymore.
Not get beat up anymore ‘cause of
their skin, killed anymore, no
power to change things because they
look different, think different.
That shit can't fly anymore - A
champion's gotta be more than just
another black man hitting things,
so I'm taking

ADONIS (CONT'D)
that anger back in the ring an'
remindin' people that they let a
man get beat defenseless 'til he
died and nobody cared and nothin'
happened.

(MORE)
52.
ADONIS (CONT'D)
Time moved on but now they're going
to see what it's like when things
are reversed.

ROCKY
I ain't saying I know what ya goin
through -

ADONIS

No, you don't. You know I respect
you more than anybody and you know
I'm not doin' this 'cause of ego, I
want to leave something behind that
means something - My father didn't,
but I do.

ROCKY
You still got to keep ya mind right
- Anything can happen.

ANTHONY
Don't put that in his head.

ROCKY
The way you feel about that, he
feels about you -

ANTHONY
That bum won't know what hit him.

ROCKY
So it's impossible to lose?

ADONIS
You think I'm going down and not
get up? This isn't yesterday - You
don't have to worry about throwin'
a towel.

ROCKY
You should have Lil Duke train you.
I think he'll cover you best an' ya
know him.

ADONIS
What about you? What's the problem?

ROCKY
I been through this -

ANTHONY
He's afraid.

ROCKY
Maybe, wish I was stronger about
this, but I'm not.
53.

ADONIS
So you're out?

ROCKY
For this. Outside the ring, fight
for whatever ya want, but inside,
the only thing ya should be
fightin' for is ya life - Good
luck.

ROCKY exits.
INT. GRAVEYARD - DAY

ROCKY pulls the CHAIR out of the TREE and places it in front
of ADRIAN'S HEADSTONE. He simply stares off into the sinking
grey light of the day...

Slowly rising up in VOLUME is the GRAND THEME of the next
scene.

H.B.O. SPECIAL

The dramatic special appears to show a high traveling
DRAMATIC shot of LAS VEGAS at night. DRAMATIC MUSIC.

NARRATOR

(dramatic)
In the desert is a crown jewel of
many lights that serve as a beacon
for travelers all over the world to
explore, be entertained and try
their luck. But several miles
beyond the glamorous oasis, across
barren desert, lies some of the
most grand and foreboding land in
the world. It's called simply
"Death Valley".

We see a shot of ADONIS running through the parched earth at
sunrise.

NARRATOR (CONT'D)
Like the man who is Adonis Creed,
the landscape is hard, resilient
and always challenging.
CUT TO:
54.
EXT. ANOTHER DEATH VALLEY LOCATION

NARRATOR
As one of the best light
heavyweights in the world, Adonis,
in a career that has seen him
struggle to emerge from the shadows
of the legendary Apollo Creed, is
putting his next title defense on
hold. He has chosen to avenge his
father's tragic death at the hands
of the infamous Ivan Drago.

Scene shifts to an OLD GYM where VITOR works out with IVAN
DRAGO in the background. He looks pumped and brutal.

NARRATOR (CONT'D)
An ocean apart and like out of a
Shakespearean drama, it is not the
patriarch but the son, Vitor Drago,
a bull of a man who will defend the
Drago name -
CUT TO:

Outdoor scenes of VITOR running.

NARRATOR (CONT'D)
The young Drago feels like the
family has unjustly suffered
because of an untimely tragedy and
Adonis Creed has not earned what he
has and should not be champion.
CUT TO:

ADONIS shadow boxing up a jagged, steep hillside with charred
rocks spread before him.

NARRATOR (CONT'D)
Adonis calls this personal and
wants to put the insults and
disrespect to rest no matter what
the cost, and with his superior
skills end this nightmare.
CUT TO:

VITOR training in the gym.
NARRATOR (CONT'D)
His opponent thinks his nightmare
is just beginning...
VITOR faces the camera.
VITOR

I'm a bad man and will beat ‘em
worse than his father got.
55.

More cuts of VITOR outside in a tank top running with a PIT
BULL who bites a stick and VITOR hurls him into the air.
CUT TO:

ADONIS as he runs across the desert, we cut to clips of his
fights.

NARRATOR
Adonis Creed, proving to be a
fearless fighter who has tested his
metal -

ADONIS is seen knocking out SEVERAL MEN in dramatic slo-mo
style.

We see VITOR in much cruder surroundings, knocking MEN out.

NARRATOR (CONT'D)
- Will pit his skill and pride
against a hostile unknown with
nothing but personal retribution on
his mind.

We see ADONIS running in dramatic fashion towards the highest
point.

NARRATOR (CONT'D)
Life is a Circle and History and
Time often do not hide the scars
and erase the ferocity of the past.
CUT TO:

VITOR standing between two classic Greek columns looking like
a modern Hercules.

NARRATOR (CONT'D)
Alongside the glory, the unknown
danger is ever present, the paths
they take will never run parallel
for each man but their personal
histories are forever star-crossed.

ADONIS arrives at the top of the cliff and stares out at the
hostile territory.

NARRATOR (CONT'D)
Like the hellish landscape that has
often proven invincible, Adonis
Creed plans to conquer this
personal challenge and move on with
his blessed life.

ADONIS (V.O.)
"... I will destroy him, I
promise."
56.

NARRATOR
The Boxer and the Beast, a brutal
reconvening, a deeply personal
journey, pulling two men from
different parts of this planet to
end of a decades long family
rivalry and their future and
family's legacy will be determined
by their skill and in the power of
their fists.

INT. MGM GRAND - ARENA

The CROWD is brimming with expectation. Several groups are
wearing "REMEMBER APOLLO" t-shirts and several hold up signs
that read "VENGEANCE IS MINE - ROMANS 12:19".

This is a very animated crowd, extremely vocal in their hate
for Drago AND the SOVIETS as well.

COMMENTATOR#1
Welcome one and all to this
evening's unusual event. The huge,
relatively unknown European with
the familiar last name, Vitor
Drago, is set to go against Light
Heavyweight Champion Adonis Creed
in what could be called a special
event, but this has a real
undercurrent of a ‘vendetta’ or
‘payback'. Earlier in the day, we
caught up with the belittled yet
unapologetic man himself, Ivan
Drago.

CUT to FOOTAGE of DRAGO.

COMMENTATOR #1
Why now?

DRAGO

(Russian accent)
Why not? This is something that has
been building long time - This
country was bad to me, having me
fight an' old man instead of the
champion. Then, in Russia, I was
embarrassed, cheated. But all will
be over soon and we'll have the
respect we deserve.

INT. ADONIS'S DRESSING ROOM

BIANCA, who is VERY PREGNANT, sits watching Adonis SHADOW
BOXING in the mirror. Anthony is present.

ADONIS moves around, slowly JABBING.
57.
From the group: YELLING OF ENCOURAGEMENT.

LIL DUKE
Stay inside his reach, okay? Can't
stay on the outside - Side to side,
then inside, got me?

ADONIS smiles at BIANCA and uses a "Hand Sign".

ADONIS
(hand signs)
».. I got this.

BIANCA
(hand signs)
I love you.

INT. DRAGO'S DRESSING ROOM

VITOR methodically throws incredibly powerful RIGHT HAND
PUNCHES into punch mitts held by DRAGO himself.

VITOR throws again.

DRAGO
Remember what they did to me.

VITOR throws with UNBELIEVABLE FORCE. It CRACKS against the
pad, sounding like a shotgun blast.

DRAGO picks up VITOR'S HUGE BOXING ROBE. From the angle, we
cannot read what is on the back. VITOR'S EYES show
disapproval.

INT. RINGSIDE
The COMMENTATORS stand up facing the camera.

COMMENTATOR #1
This is the first time in several
years Balboa will not be in his
corner. Why do you think that is?

COMMENTATOR #2
Maybe he just isn't on board with
this "fight" because of what
happened years ago when things went
tragically wrong...

The CAMERA pans the crowd.

COMMENTATOR #1
Tonight, the "past" catches up to
the "present" and sets the
future...
58.
ROCKY takes his seat directly behind Adonis's corner.

The LIGHTS DIM. A BLUE HAZE BACKDROP provides a dramatic
display as the DRAGOS enter the arena. The building resonates
with BOOS. HEAVY METAL MUSIC blares from the speakers.

Stepping into view is VITOR.

COMMENTATOR #1 (0.S.) (CONT'D)
Vitor has fought all his life under
a different name, tonight is the
first time he will be announced by
his real name -

COMMENTATOR #2 (0.S.)
Said they were embarrassed by what
happened years ago.

COMMENTATOR #1 (0.S.)
That may change tonight - Vitor
Drago is a very powerful looking
man but will his ability keep up
with Adonis Creed's ringmanship?

COMMENTATOR #2 (0.S.)
Good question, but he looks hard
core.

Many of the CROWD taunt DRAGO with FOUL LANGUAGE. One bold
ANTI-FAN attempts to grab hold of VITOR'S SHOULDER.

DRAGO GRABS the anti-fan BY THE CHEST and SHOVES him back
roughly into the crowd.

Tough as VITOR is, he is disturbed by the growing level of
hatred as he moves towards the ring... He did not expect this
INTENSITY.

COMMENTATOR #1 (0.S.)
One unruly fan just got manhandled
by Drago.

VITOR reaches the ring and enters. IVAN stands besides his
son, soaking up the energy of being in the limelight again.
The MUSIC is very intimidating, vicious.

The crowd BOOS. DRAGO calmly MOCKS the crowd with an upraised
fist.

Turning around, we see embroidered on the back of Vitor's
robe: "APOLLO R.I.P."

COMMENTATOR #1 (0.S.) (CONT'D)
(re: robe)
That's in really bad taste.
Actually, appalling.
59.

COMMENTATOR #3 (0.S.)
If he wanted to mess with Creed's
head, that'll do it.

The MUSIC changes.
INT. ARENA

The crowd cheers as ADONIS appears on the SCREEN. His music
BLARES.

COMMENTATOR #1 (0.S.)
Adonis Creed now making his
entrance. Definitely a crowd
favorite.

ADONIS, game face on, CLIMBS into the ring. The crowd LOVES
HIM!!

VITOR immediately steps to the center of the ring and gives
the THROAT SLITTING gesture.

As VITOR turns, ADONIS sees the back of the ROBE: APOLLO
R.I.P.

ADONIS LOSES IT! Tries to RUSH FORWARD as VITOR stands like
an intimidating statue. Lil Duke BLOCKS HIS PATH.

ADONIS
(pointing to Vitor)
+.. Gonna beat your sick ass!

COMMENTATOR #1 (0.S.)
Adonis Creed is enraged and
attempts to get to Vitor Drago, who
mocks him!

ADONIS'S anger is glowing but LIL DUKE, along with CORNERMEN
and official RING SECURITY manage to separate them.

DRAGO is enjoying the mayhem.

VITOR
You're goin' be under my foot!

INT. RINGSIDE - MOMENTS LATER
RING ANNOUNCER

In the blue corner, with a mixed
martial arts record of 45 and 2 and
60.

RING ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)
26 professional boxing fights, this
being his debut in America,
weighing 235 pounds, Vitor "The
Hammer" Drago!

A few RUSSIANS in the audience applaud but are drowned out by
the pro-American crowd. It only inflames DRAGO.

BIANCA, very much on edge, takes her seat. She eyes Buddy
"King" Charles... She's not happy. ANTHONY sits next to her.

RING ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)
In the red corner, weighing 199
pounds, the newly crowned Light
Heavyweight Champion of the World,
Adonis "Speed" Creed!

The crowd EXPLODES!

COMMENTATOR #1
Certainly has the support of this
crowd behind him!

COMMENTATOR #2
They want Vitor Drago demolished
but that's a big task if Vitor has
a "jaw" to match his size.

The REFEREE motions of the COMBATANTS to come to the center
of the ring.

The BELL RINGS and DROWNS OUT the last curse word.

ADONIS goes straight forward and LOCKS EYES with the huge
man. IVAN DRAGO exchanges DAGGER EXPRESSIONS with ROCKY, who
he has detected sitting behind Creed's corner.

As the REFEREE gives instructions, the two fighters overlap
one another with VULGAR INSULTS.

REFEREE
I want a clean fight. Protect
yourself at all times and when I
say ‘break', break. Good luck -

VITOR
Where ya gonna run, boy?

VITOR holds out his gloves.

ADONIS
I'm gonna close that mouth.

DRAGO
++. You've lost.
61.
The men return to their CORNERS.

COMMENTATOR #1
++. You can actually feel the
hatred for each other here.

IVAN DRAGO steps outside the ropes. He turns, facing his son.

DRAGO
(in Russian)
You were born for this.

LIL DUKE looks deep into Adonis's eyes.

LIL DUKE
Control that shit! Stay inside his
reach.

ADONIS simply wants to get it on!

ADONIS
Ring the bell!

BIANCA sits nearly frozen in apprehension.

ANTHONY
(to Adonis)
You got this! You got it!

The BELL RINGS and Adonis CHARGES the Big Man with bad
intentions.

COMMENTATOR #1 (0.S.)
Adonis wastes no time attacking the
much larger Vitor Drago! No
‘feeling out' round, folks!

COMMENTATOR #2 (0.S.)
What a surprise - The smaller man
has Drago backing up!

COMMENTATOR #3 (0.S.)
Creed's making a statement early
on!

VITOR pushes the smaller fighter away and then is FURIOUSLY
ATTACKED again by Adonis. Adonis circles and fires off rapid
jabs.

ROCKY
Forget the head! The body!!

INT. CREED MANSION - DEN - NIGHT

MARY ANNE watches Adonis rip into the big Russian.
CUT TO:
62.
INT. RING
DRAGO does not like what he sees and BERATES his son.

DRAGO
(in Russian)
Attack!

VITOR goes into attack mode.
CUT TO:

ROCKY: from his point of view, this looks almost exactly like
the beating that was given to APOLLO.

WE CUT BACK AND FORTH FROM THE OLD
FOOTAGE TO THE PRESENT
DAY... THE COMPARISON IS EERIE.

Adonis comes in straight ahead and gets caught with a
THUNDEROUS BLOW which delights Drago.

VITOR
Hit me. That's it?

VITOR turns to the CROWD and gives ADONIS a THUMBS DOWN
gesture.

ADONIS starts to rapidly CIRCLE and JAB. They are barely
reaching the target, but Vitor is starting to WALK THROUGH
the punches.

VITOR (CONT'D)
C'mon, gimme somethin' - Gimme
somethin'.

ROCKY sits. He is feeling every emotion a fighter would feel
who was in the ring.

ROCKY
Back off!

COMMENTATOR #1 (0.S.)
Adonis is still going after his
opponent but falling short.

COMMENTATOR #2 (0.S.)
Vitor's big right hand is locked
and loaded!!

Sure enough, ADONIS throws a LEFT HOOK and VITOR counters
with a thudding RIGHT, which badly ROCKS ADONIS.

ADONIS rapidly backs up against the ROPES. ADONIS tries to
lay him up and VITOR SMASHES ADONIS in the JAW with a
flagrant illegal elbow! CROWD boos. The REFEREE admonishes
him. VITOR mocks ADONIS.
63.

ROCKY
(from seat)
Circle, circle! Off the ropes!
(to himself)
He's done.

The crowd SCREAMS for ADONIS to rally.

VITOR cuts Adonis off: Adonis is again PINNED AGAINST THE
ROPES.

COMMENTATOR #2 (0.S.)
Drago is like having a brick wall
standing in front of you!

VITOR delivers a pair of LEFT - RIGHT COMBOS that land with
concussive force!

Adonis FIGHTS ON and CATCHES Vitor with a BODY-PUNCH to his
LIVER.

ANTHONY
Yes!! That's what I'm talking
about!

LIL DUKE
That's it! More of the same! Bust
him up!

But VITOR is too powerful and smiles at him - Telling him to
hit him again, harder.

BIANCA leaps to her feet.
BIANCA
(yells)
You got to stop this!!
INT. RING

VITOR, hands at his side, sticks out his JAW. ADONIS hits it.
NO EFFECT.

Then, like a BOLT OF LIGHTNING from hell, Vitor EXPLODES with
a brutal OVERHAND RIGHT that clubs ADONIS behind the ear and

sends him CRASHING TO THE CANVAS!!

The AUDIENCE IS STUNNED.

FEAR fills Rocky's eyes. HE ALMOST WANTS ADONIS TO STAY DOWN.

ROCKY
Take the count!!
64.

VITOR says something unintelligible to the fallen fighter,
then RAISING HIS FIST, he strolls to a neutral corner.

ADONIS goes to ONE KNEE. We see a moment of DOUBT creep into
his eyes. EVERYTHING IS OUT OF FOCUS.

VITOR disdainfully wipes the BLOOD way from his NOSE and
glances at this father.

COMMENTATOR #3 (0.S.)
This is the advantage of a full-
blown super heavy weight -
incredible hitting power. One punch
and it's good night!

COMMENTATOR #2 (0.S.)
Creed just can't get inside!

COMMENTATOR #1
And he is being dismantled by the
brutal strength and rough house
tactics of Vitor Drago!

COMMENTATOR #1 (0.S.) (CONT'D)
Creed better find plan B fast.
What's he doing? He's waving Drago
forward!

COMMENTATOR #2 (0.S.)
That's crazy!

INT. CREED MANSION - DEN
Mary Anne SCREAMS at the TV:

MARY ANNE
Stop the damn fight!

INT. RING
ADONIS - HURT AND HUMILIATED - RISES.

BIANCA
Oh, my God - Just stay down.

ANTHONY looks VERY SHAKEN UP by the unexpected beating his
brother is receiving.

COMMENTATOR #2 (0.S.)
The ref is about to stop this one-
sided affair.

COMMENTATOR #1 (0.S.)
Creed better throw something back
or it's over!

FIVE SECONDS!
65.

LIL DUKE
Let the damn hands go!!

Vitor unloads a BRUTAL BODY SHOT that causes Creed's knees to
almost buckle. BELL!! He shoves ADONIS hard and returns to
the corner, fist raised.
Buddy "King" Charles rises with his BODYGUARD.
BUDDY
(to bodyguard)
++. It's over.
ANTHONY is dismayed as he watches BUDDY exit.
IN THE RING:
LIL DUKE climbs into the ring along with his CORNERMEN.
ROCKY rushes to the step behind Creed's corner.
ROCKY
(to Adonis)

You can't do this!

ADONIS
You did!

DUKE
(to Adonis)
Listen to me, not him!
DRAGO'S CORNER:
DRAGO
(yelling in Russian)
He's finished - Back him up and
beat him down, make it last.
INT. RINGSIDE
ANTHONY looks very badly affected by this horrible beating.
CREED'S CORNER:

ADONIS and LIL DUKE. Duke yells into the fighter's profile.
Adonis sneaks glances at Vitor then Bianca.

LIL DUKE
Man, you gotta step it up! Move,
goddamnit, don't come at him!

BIANCA is pacing in the aisle. She looks at ROCKY.
66.
LIL DUKE (CONT'D)
Don't need you takin' his 'best',
ya gotta just stop doing' the shit
ya don't got to be doin' -
ADONIS rises.
LIL DUKE (CONT'D)
(yelling)
You got a bad man in front of you
so let it go and get that chump
outta here!!
THE BELL RINGS.

ADONIS catches a glimpse of ROCKY as he moves to the center
of the ring.

VITOR moves to the CENTER of the ring. Surprisingly ADONIS
attacks first!

COMMENTATOR #1 (0.S.)
Can't say this man doesn't have
heart, but here comes Drago!

VITOR hits back with a combination that nearly RIPS Adonis's
head from his shoulder.

ROCKY
(to Lil Duke)
He's done! Call it!
ROCKY's point of view:

We go to SLOW MOTION as --

It is almost a DUPLICATE of the DEADLY PUNCH that killed
Apollo.

Still in SLOW MOTION, we see BIANCA rise to her feet as
Adonis DRIFTS HELPLESSLY towards the ropes.

LIL DUKE desperately reaches for the TOWEL.

IVAN DRAGO rises to his feet, his face flushed, SCREAMING for
victory.

Sensing the end is near, the AUDIENCE seems to RISE as one.

Vitor's face contorts into a mask of HATE and FURY as he
coils back his body and unleashes a brutal left hook.

The CROWD goes CRAZY!

ROCKY rushes forward and rips the TOWEL from LIL DUKE'S hands
and THROWS IT!
67.

As the TOWEL is in mid-air, VITOR now unleashes all his power
into a SEISMIC OVERHAND PUNCH that pile drives Adonis
unconscious to the canvas.

COMMENTATOR #1 (0.S.)
Creed is OUT!! My God, what a shot
and he's not getting up! One of the
most vicious shots ever! A
sensational right hand knockout for
the powerful Vitor Drago!

CREED'S CORNERMEN LEAP into the ring followed by professional
CAMERA CREWS and MEDICAL EXPERTS. IT IS COMPLETE MAYHEM.

The arena goes BERSERK.

BIANCA struggles to get into the ring but is blocked. She
cries hysterically.

ROCKY shoves past the gathering crowd of security people and
other personnel.

ROCKY kneels besides Adonis as the RING PHYSICIAN and MEDICAL
EMERGENCY STAFF examine him.

COMMENTATOR #1 (0.S.) (CONT'D)
A BRUTAL knockout. The kind you
hate to see!

ADONIS'S eyes slowly open.
COMMENTATOR #3 (0.S.)

Now he's moving! He's still out of
it but at least he's looking around

VITOR PUMPS HIS FIST at the crowd.
ROCKY
Don't move, kid - You'll be
alright.

IVAN DRAGO pats his son's shoulder but he is more interested
in GLARING at ROCKY.

The image of Adonis is displayed on the JUMBOTRON SCREEN.

ROCKY is beside Adonis, who now has been lifted into a seated
position against the ropes.

BIANCA is outside the ring, crying as she tries to inch
closer.

ROCKY (CONT'D)
Let ‘em check you out!!
68.
It is CHAOTIC!
The JUMBOTRON plays back the KNOCKOUT again for the crowd in
SLO-MOTION.
CUT TO:

IVAN DRAGO muscles his way through the CROWDED RING and
hovers over ROCKY and ADONIS.

DRAGO
(cold)
«+. He still alive?

ROCKY turns and unleashes a BIG RIGHT HOOK that instantly
BLOODIES Drago's mouth.

Rocky POUNDS AWAY: another RIGHT/LEFT/RIGHT combination that
DRIVES Ivan Drago back!

SHOCKED ONLOOKERS back away from the sudden violence.
COMMENTATOR #1 (0.S.)
A fight has broken out! The two men
are throwing wild punches!
The AUDIENCE ROARS.
VITOR pauses from TAUNTING. He RUSHES towards them as -

The massive Ivan Drago POUNDS Rocky with BRUTAL PUNCHES.

ROCKY is SMASHED AGAINST the ROPES but rallies and refuses to
go down - He pounds furiously away on DRAGO'S BODY.

SECURITY rush in and separate the MEN.
VITOR arrives as his father TOWERS MENACINGLY over ROCKY.
ROCKY, terribly exhausted, slumps to the ground.

DRAGO
You never beat me!!

ROCKY
(winded)
Who cares!
The scene FREEZES IN A PHOTO STILL of ROCKY and ADONIS
HEADLINE: "PARTNERS IN PAIN".

each other.
69.

ADONIS

INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY

Late at night, very little activity.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM

The silence is overwhelming as ADONIS lays sedated in bed.
His mind still racing over what has transpired. The door to
his room OPENS.

A LARGE FIGURE walks across the room and takes a seat in the
shadows. Only his outline is seen because of the glow of the
MOONLIGHT emanating from the rear window.

ADONIS
Who are you?

STRANGER
You know me, course you do.

The STRANGER leans forward and we see it is APOLLO CREED!

ADONIS
You're dead.

APOLLO
Went out the hard way.

ADONIS
You had everything.

APOLLO
It's never enough.

ADONIS
But you left everyone behind.
70.

APOLLO
You come in alone, go out alone.

ADONIS
Did you know about me?

APOLLO
No.

ADONIS
Would it have mattered?

APOLLO
It's good being worth something to
others, but it's better to be worth
more to yourself.

ADONIS
So you only cared about you?

They both look at each other. Holding the moment.
ADONIS (CONT'D)
Did you even love my mom? Or Mary
Anne?
APOLLO
Relationships come and go. Honor,
that lasts... Glory, that lasts...
INT. CAT SCAN ROOM
ADONIS opens his badly bruised eyes.
Moments later, ROCKY walks in.
INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY
ADONIS follows a NURSE down the hall in the MATERNITY WARD.

ADONIS'S face is still quite SWOLLEN but he is feeling no

The NURSE stops him at the door of a DELIVERY ROOM.

INT. BIANCA'S ROOM - NIGHT

BIANCA lays in the bed with a lovely INFANT by her side.
The door opens and ADONIS enters.

ADONIS is almost moved to tears. He studies the INFANT'S

features as he looks speechless and grateful to BIANCA.
BIANCA, though exhausted, is glowing.
71.

ADONIS
--. She's beautiful.

BIANCA
Yes... Baby, sit down.

ADONIS
I missed it...

She's here now.

ADONIS

BIANCA
Tests were inconclusive.

ADONIS
+... When can we try again?

BIANCA
(nods)
... When we're home - That okay?

ADONIS
++. Sure.

ADONIS thoughtfully nods.
INT. MGM GRAND

VITOR and his CORNERMEN are passing through the lobby. He
pauses to sign for a couple of FOREIGN TOURISTS... Takes
pictures.

They see the FOOTAGE on the JUMBOTRON from the fight. VITOR
is pounding out ADONIS. The CRAWL reads: "VITOR DRAGO TESTS
POSITIVE FOR PERFORMANCE ENHANCING DRUGS".

JIM LAMPLEY (ON JUMBOTRON)
European fighter Vitor Drago ran
afoul of the "Clean Boxing
Initiative" and was found to be
using a pair of antibiotic
substances, as a result, Drago has
been put in harm's way and placed
on suspension by boxing's governing
bodies. Increasingly in boxing, you
can run from a positive test but
you can't hide. Meanwhile...
73.

The blood drains from the fighter's face. People stare at
him.

INT. VEGAS HOTEL - MORNING

VITOR walks forcefully down the hallway and stops where he
proceeds to POUND on the hotel room door. After a moment,
Buddy "King" Charles's BODYGUARD opens the door.

VITOR pushes past the BODYGUARD.

He goes in the room and sees BUDDY with DRAGO, who PACES.

VITOR
This is bullshit!!

DRAGO
He doesn't understand, this is
good.

VITOR

That I cheat?

BUDDY
Don't let a bunch of half-assed
American sports headlines bother
you.

VITOR
You let him do this?

BUDDY
Don't worry about it.
(beat)
You're for real and we're creating
"controversy". You killed his
manhood -

VITOR
I won this clean!

BUDDY
Nothing's clean.

BUDDY (CONT'D)
From the beginning, your old man
only wanted to take this show to
Russia, now, if he wants it, he's
got to come to us. Vitor, don't
over think it - You had nothing
three months ago.

VITOR glares at his father and exits.
74.
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

ADONIS, BIANCA and ROCKY are sitting in silence. She holds
the baby.

ANTHONY almost BURSTS into the room.

ANTHONY
(elated)
You watching the TV? It's on fire -
He wasn't clean! You didn't lose -
He cheated!!

ADONIS remains silent.

BIANCA
Hold it down, please.

ANTHONY
It's good news - Gotta feel good
about this - Everybody knows it's
all bullshit - You're the better
man.

ADONIS
I hear you.

ANTHONY
I got to be feelin' good about this
- No bullshit back talk about
getting you ass beat - You could
have won it on the up and up!
Y'know what I'm saying!

BIANCA
He knows.

ANTHONY
What's happening here? Man, I
thought you'd be jumpin' all up and
down, wanting him all over again!
You all right, man?

EXT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY
ROCKY stands with ANTHONY.
ROCKY
He's beat up, a beatin' like that

ANTHONY
I get it -
75.

ROCKY
You don't get nothin' - He's
hurtin', his world's upside down.

ANTHONY
He'll fix all that. He's got it
all, he'll get it back. That punk
was juiced.

ROCKY
I don't care what he was, fighters
are never the same after a beatin'
like that. It's a life changer.

ANTHONY
What's that mean? He's done?

ROCKY
He needs to think about things.

ANTHONY
Are you saying it's over?
Everything - business, reputation -
He always comes back.

ROCKY
Until ya don't. You all about the
money?

ANTHONY
Don't insult me, man. He's my
brother.

ROCKY

Then be there.

Here's my email!

He holds up a SMALL CARDBOARD SIGN that has his EMAIL ADDRESS
written out.

VITOR (CONT'D)
Write it down! Everybody listen up.
If he does not have the balls
because he was beat down so bad,
smashed so bad, I'm makin' the
offer to anyone who's good! Anyone
who's tough enough! Any person, any
nationality, any breed. I am the
best man there is, no anger here!
I'm gonna be a legend - Put this on

who he is or what he is, but real

Don't worry about it.

You scared?

Don't ever say that.

ANTHONY
You look scared. That's what
"scared" looks like.

ADONIS
Go home.

ADONIS starts to leave and ANTHONY angles in front of him.

ANTHONY
Didn't say it's all bad - Who
wouldn't be scared? Who wouldn't
wanna say "fuck it, who needs
this?" Who wouldn't be embarrassed,
like no man should! Bad shit
happened but you weren't all there.

ADONIS
Or maybe I'm not what I think I am.

ANTHONY
There is that! You could say that -
But it's not true -

ANTHONY paces a few steps back.

ANTHONY (CONT'D)
Now me, that's who I am. I'm not

gifts, you got skills. You got
everything from Pops.

I got the leftovers, but hey, it is
what it is - It's okay, once ya
accept you're not so special, but
goddamn, you - You got
responsibilities to people like me
to show what a special man "can" do
when everything says ya "can't"!
You got a damn important
responsibility to show what is
possible when smart money say
impossible!! People like me quit,
that's not so unusual, ‘cause I
don't have the same gifts like you
but not people like you, ‘cause if
the warriors quit... We don't walk
away ‘cause shit get ugly, we don't
walk away ‘cause life kicks our ass
on a daily basis, but we keep
tryin' even if it's hard and
frustrating and unrewarding and
nobody's even gonna be cheerin' our
name, we still have that pride that
gets our ass out of bed in the
morning to try all over again. You
got "gifts" like I said, "skills"
and not to use them makes me mad -
Mad.

ADONIS
I'm not afraid.

ANTHONY
No - What?

ADONIS
... Ashamed.

ANTHONY
So what? You let people down.

ADONIS
So what?

ANTHONY
So what?

ANTHONY (CONT'D)
Who asked you to be "all that" to
everybody - Put you first and ya
family first and whatever's left
over, pass it around. People need
to see what's "possible".

ADONIS
An' if I get knocked out again?
81.
ANTHONY
Then I guess it was "impossible"
an' forget we ever had this fucked
up conversation.

ADONIS finally breaks into a smile and they embrace.

enters and climbs the dark steps.

Reaching the top, he flips on a light that illuminates part
of the gym.

He heads to the SPEED BAGS.

The BABY CARRIER is placed on a stool. He kisses the INFANT
then goes to the speed bag.

He starts to hit slowly at first. The sound reverberates
throughout the empty, dark gym.

No reaction from the INFANT. ADONIS increases the SPEED. No
reaction. Fear and SWEAT form on ADONIS'S BROW as he POUNDS
HARDER and FASTER.

No reaction.

ADONIS'S eyes flash back and forth in near desperation
between the speed bag and his child. No reaction.

His raw hands increase the tempo of the speed bag until its
thunderous sound rattles the gym walls!

No reaction.
82.*

In final desperation, he reaches a mighty CRESCENDO and WHIPS
the left hook into the bag which SMASHES it against the
wooden surface.

This creates a sudden, unexpected explosion that resembles a
SHOT BLAST!!

He looks to the INFANT who is startled and begins to cry.

ADONIS slumps against the wall and begins to cry himself.

The THREE AMERICAN BROADCASTERS are in front of the ring
facing the cameras.
89.

COMMENTATOR #1
Welcome one and all to this
evening's event in Moscow on this
cold evening. Earlier this evening,
both fighters arrived at the arena
to prepare for the rematch.
CUT TO:

ADONIS, followed by ROCKY, LIL DUKE, CUTMAN, and ANTHONY.
ADONIS wears EAR BUDS and wears a game face. Beside him is
BIANCA.

COMMENTATOR #1 (CONT'D)
A very heavy underdog, Adonis Creed
has sworn that this evening will
definitely not be a repeat of the
blowout and frightening ending of
their last encounter.

CUT TO:

VITOR DRAGO strides confidently into the building, flanked by
his FATHER and CORNER ENTOURAGE... Vitor's eyes are ominously
hidden beneath his hoodie.

COMMENTATOR #1 (CONT'D)
Ivan Drago has made it clear this
will be a worse beat down than
before...

CUT TO:
INT. RINGSIDE

The COMMENTATORS are lined up before the cameras... They
stand with promoter BUDDY "KING" CHARLES.

COMMENTATOR #1
With us now is promoter Buddy
"King" Charles - Why the passion
for this rematch, considering the
results in Vegas being so one
sided?

BUDDY
History. The last time an American
fought here, the results were not
good. A big victory tonight for
Drago would help erase that.

INT. ADONIS'S DRESSING ROOM

ROCKY is wrapping Adonis's hands. BIANCA and the corner crew
look on as do RUSSIAN BOXING OFFICIALS.

ADONIS appears consumed with inner turmoil. Nervous sweat
rims his forehead. ROCKY senses the growing anxiety.
90.

ROCKY
Breathe.

INT. VITOR'S DRESSING ROOM

The place is very active with well-dressed POLITICAL
OFFICIALS taking photos with VITOR. Many players of the upper
class and their WOMEN.

VITOR DRAGO is not enjoying this activity. IVAN is.

TWO CAMERA CREWS, including a third SHOWTIME CREW, take in
the pre-celebratory atmosphere.

VITOR is a caged animal.
INT. RINGSIDE
The SHOWTIME CREW analyze.
COMMENTATOR #1

Since Creed and Balboa requested no

cameras be in the dressing room, we

can only assume he is very focused

and wants to stay that way.
INT. ADONIS'S DRESSING ROOM
ADONIS'S hands are being checked by the RUSSIAN OFFICIAL.
Once done, he gets up and paces towards a mirror. He studies

his reflection.

ROCKY
What's the plan?

ADONIS
To be first.

ROCKY
He throws?

ADONIS
I throw first.

ROCKY
He hooks?

ADONIS
I hook first.

ROCKY
He hit you hard?

ADONIS
I hit him harder!
91.

ROCKY
Sounds like a plan.

ADONIS smiles at BIANCA.
INT. RINGSIDE

A young RUSSIAN BAND plays. The mood is festive yet charged
as people settle into their seats. RUSSIAN FLAGS hang all
around the top of the ring.

COMMENTATOR #1 (0.S.)
They are in party mode here in
Moscow! They want something special
this evening. Homecoming for the
once invincible Ivan Drago.

COMMENTATOR #2 (0.S.)
Since Creed was so easily
dispatched in the first go-round
he's now considered a 25-1
underdog. Maybe a classic case of
"Careful what you wish for".

INT. DRAGO'S DRESSING ROOM

The FIGHT OFFICIAL leans in and states that they are about to
enter the ring soon. IVAN DRAGO nods but continues to mingle
with the FASHIONABLE CROWD, SMILING for the first time.
Enjoying the attention.

VITOR stands alone, shadow boxing, trying to get emotionally
focused.

VITOR
(to assistant)
Get them out.

ASSISTANT
(gestures towards Drago)
He wants them...

VITOR roughly turns off the MUSIC coming from an IPHONE and
SPEAKER.

VITOR
(in Russian)
Gol
(to camera crew)
Watch the fight - Go watch it!
Enough of this shit!

DRAGO
(in Russian)
What are you doing?
92.
VITOR ignores him.

VITOR
(to crowd)
Gol

DRAGO
I said, what are you doing?!

VITOR
This is my time, not yours!

VITOR glares at DRAGO with a ferocity never seen before.

DRAGO
Don't look at me that way! We are
all we have, Vitor, it is all - I
am not a good man, I know that. I
treat you bad, I do not know why,
but I do and your will and your
strength has brought me back here -
All I wanted. Tonight, win for you.
You have already won for me.

VITOR is stunned by this REVELATION.
INT. RINGSIDE

COMMENTATOR #1
We heard that Adonis has put on
more weight and hopefully muscle
since

COMMENTATOR #1 (CONT'D)
their last fight. Adonis Creed
should be entering this arena any
second now.

The SPOTLIGHTS are aimed at the tunnel.

The CROWD begins STOMPING their feet.

INT. ARENA TUNNEL

ADONIS, ANTHONY, PADMAN and ROCKY approach the entrance into

the ARENA. They pass an ARENA GUARD who speaks into a walkie-
talkie. Adonis's MUSIC STARTS... BIANCA, microphone in hand,

steps forward, SINGING LIVE THE SONG SHE HAD STARTED TO

COMPOSE EARLIER... It is dynamic! ADONIS gestures to lead the
way.

INT. RINGSIDE

The CROWD faces the entrance.
93.

COMMENTATOR #1 (0.S.)
Music's up, Adonis Creed's entering
the arena, I believe that is
Bianca, singing the entrance song,
that's new and good.

COMMENTATOR #2 (0.S.)
She's great.

ADONIS enters and his BIANCA'S MUSIC KICKS INTO HIGH GEAR.
ADONIS glances at the HOSTILE CROWD and then at ROCKY.

ADONIS arrives at the ring and kisses BIANCA. He stares hard
at the THREE STEPS leading into the ring. DAUNTING. Taking a
DEEP BREATH, he climbs them.

CUT TO:

INT. ADONIS AND BIANCA'S APARTMENT

MARY ANNE CREED sits with the NANNY and the INFANT as she
observes Adonis's entrance on TV.

INT. RINGSIDE
The LIGHTS and MUSIC suddenly CHANGE.

The SPOTLIGHTS wing to the entrance: time for VITOR DRAGO and
COMPANY.

VITOR enters to the THUNDEROUS APPLAUSE and his hard-core,
HEAVY METAL music by the group "Slip Knot".

Wearing his SKULL FACE BANDANA around his lower face, he
presents an INTIMIDATING image.

IVAN DRAGO walks directly behind his hulking son, but his
demeanor is vastly different.

He appears lost in thought, transported back in time to when
he was the invincible fighter of his country.

In his mind, Drago hears the original RUSSIAN NATIONAL ANTHEM
playing and glances up at the massive BANNER that depicts his
youthful image super-imposed over the former Russian flag.

Ivan SNAPS BACK TO REALITY when they arrive at the ring. He
climbs through the rope.

BUDDY "KING" CHARLES sits near the ring.

COMMENTATOR #1 (0.S.)
Big Vitor Drago enters, followed by
the stone-faced Ivan Drago. Vitor
Drago, a hard punching son who
actually enjoys slowly breaking his
opponent down.
94,

COMMENTATOR #2 (0.S.)
».. Looks bigger than last time.

VITOR walks over to ADONIS'S CORNER and glares at him. In a
condescending motion, he dares Adonis to move forward. IVAN
DRAGO stands close by and GLARES at ROCKY.

CUT TO:

INT. RINGSIDE

COMMENTATOR #1 (0.S.)
The psych-out begins.

ADONIS stares at VITOR and gestures at the skull scarf
covering the big Russian's nose and jaw.

ADONIS
Ain't Halloween, fool.

VITOR
(gestures around)
Yeah it is.

VITOR backs up and IVAN DRAGO gives ROCKY a withering stare
before moving toward his corner.

COMMENTATOR #1 (0.S.)
The men are exchanging words and
gestures. The corners try to keep
the antagonism under control until
the bell, even the ref is telling
them to back off.

VITOR uses the "Cutting the Throat" gesture. The crowd loves
it.

COMMENTATOR #1 (CONT'D)
They won't let up. Drago and Rocky
are having their own stare down!!
This could be a double feature -

The RING ANNOUNCER steps to the center of the ring and the
BELL RINGS.

RING ANNOUNCER

(in Russian)
Welcome to tonight's main event! We
are honored to have back home one
of the greatest athletes ever
produced from this country. Former
two time Olympic Heavyweight
Champion - A man who still holds
the record with six Gold Medals in
world competition - Ivan Drago!

The place erupts in CHEERS!
95.

COMMENTATOR #2 (0.S.)
Guess they failed to mention the
only man to defeat him happens to
be about 20 feet away -

COMMENTATOR #3
- Minor detail.

RING ANNOUNCER
Without delay, in the blue corner,
from the United States -

A smattering of BOOS from the audience.

RING ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)
- Weighing 200 pounds, the reigning
light heavyweight champion, Adonis
Creed!

VERY LITTLE APPLAUSE.
VITOR continues to GESTURE and VERBALLY MOCK Adonis.

ROCKY
He'll talk less when ya break the
ribs.

ROCKY manages a faint smile at ADONIS then locks eyes with
DRAGO.

RING ANNOUNCER
In the red corner, standing six
foot, five inches, weighing an even
253 pounds, with seventeen
consecutive knockouts, Russian's
own Vitor "Red Devil" Drago!

The crowd GOES CRAZY!

VITOR
You tell ‘em that?

VITOR raises his fist but is annoyed.

COMMENTATOR #1 (0.S.)
He's a hard case, no doubt. Maybe
Adonis can soften him up this time.

COMMENTATOR #2 (0.S.)
Vitor Drago is immense but Creed
looks as hard as steel - Damn good.
96.

COMMENTATOR #1 (0.S.)
I heard he put in weeks in the
desert. We'll see if something
worked.

The CORNER MEN clear the ring.
ADONIS and VITOR go to the CENTER of the RING.

REFEREE
(British)
You both know the rules. In case of
a knockdown, you will go to a
neutral corner. Break when I say
break. May the best man win.

VITOR
Your eyes say you're scared.

ADONIS
Actually, they say "Fuck you".

They return to their respective corners.

ROCKY faces ADONIS as Adonis glances down at BIANCA sitting
in the second row.

ROCKY
Ya gonna get hit hard. Prepare for
it. Expect it! Keep the head
movin', down low. Smash the body!

ADONIS
Love ya, Unc.

Adonis WAVES at BIANCA, who is TEARING UP already.

DRAGO leans over to his son, who stands like a statue,
glaring at ADONIS.

DRAGO
This night changes everything!

VITOR ignores him and stares straight across at ADONIS.

COMMENTATOR #1 (0.S.)
There's the bell! Out charges
Creed!

ADONIS moves directly into HARM'S WAY and BOB-WEAVES under
Vitor's jab and scores three major BODY BLOWS that make Vitor
WINCE.

COMMENTATOR #1 (0.S.) (CONT'D)
Here's a new look from Adonis
Creed.
97.

VITOR begins to come forward and NAILS Creed twice. Creed
backs away and starts circling while jabbing, much like his
old style.

ROCKY
What're you doin'? The body!

COMMENTATOR #2 (0.S.)
That new style didn't last long.
Now Creed is fighting in his usual
style.

VITOR is enraged and circles after him, his big right hand
COCKED BACK.

ROCKY
Stay close! Get low!

INT. APPLEBEE'S RESTAURANT

ROBERT and several of his FRIENDS are having a VIEWING PARTY.
They are transfixed on the bank of TELEVISIONS that line the
establishment.

VIEWER
What do you think? Two rounds?

INT. RING

Adonis REMAINS UPRIGHT and hits the man with two more jabs
while backpedaling. He unbelievably THROWS A THREE PUNCH
COMBO that lands.

The crowd goes NUTS.

DRAGO
(screaming)
Attack!

COMMENTATOR #1 (0.S.)
It's amazing. Creed is almost
landing at will.

COMMENTATOR #2 (0.S.)
But the punches are having no
effect as the lack of leverage
works against Creed.

ADONIS continues to rapidly CIRCLE and hit the RUSSIAN with
three more jabs while quickly backing away.

COMMENTATOR #1 (0.S.)
A blistering pace by Creed and
Drago looks like he wants to kill
him.
98.

Adonis CIRCLES. He throws another LEFT-RIGHT-HOOK
combination, followed by a SCORCHING HOOK!

It's amazing: the CROWD is staring to BOO!

DRAGO
Catch this bastard!

VITOR charges with his RIGHT HAND cocked back. Adonis side-
steps and throws two more jabs. Changes direction and
UNLEASHES a pair of brilliant right hands that drives the
AUDIENCE'S BOOING to a VOLCANIC PITCH!

VITOR literally charges at ADONIS with murder in his eyes.
ADONIS changes direction and catches him AGAIN!!
COMMENTATOR #1 (0.S.)
This is deja uv. This is exactly
the way his father fought against

Vitor's father.

ADONIS throws a couple more JABS but they are brushed aside
like pesky flies.

VITOR'S grimace has been replaced with a SINISTER GRIN. He
WAVES Adonis forward!!

Meanwhile, Vitor's huge left arm is hanging at his side as he
moves FORWARD.

ADONIS throws another jab that lands and Vitor SMIRKS and
GESTURES to try it again!

ROCKY
He's setting you up! Get off the
ropes.
VITOR lets ADONIS hit him with a RIGHT HAND, then unleashes a
TOWERING OVERHAND RIGHT that SMASHES into Creed's face and
sends him REELING BACK into the rope!
The crowd EXPLODES.
INT. CREED MANSION
MARY ANNE is panicking.
MARY ANNE
Oh God, no -
CUT TO:
INT. RING

Three gruesome BODY SHOTS painfully drive ADONIS along the
ropes.

Just when it looks hopeless, Adonis RALLIES.
CUT TO:

INT. ARENA
ANTHONY
Tie him up!
CUT TO:
INT. RING

VITOR charges back and throws a right that connects a seconds
AFTER THE BELL RINGS.

ADONIS reacts to the CHEAP SHOT by countering with a LEFT
HOOK. The REFEREE separates them.

VITOR SHOVES HIM and CURSES.
VITOR
(to Adonis)
You can't hit for shit -
DRAGO comes over. ROCKY guides ADONIS away.
COMMENTATOR #1 (0.S.)
The fighters hit after the bell and
this arena is on the verge of
pandemonium. Drago and Rocky
exchanged words! And Adonis Creed
is off to a rough start.
COMMENTATOR #2 (0.S.)
He's lucky to survive that
onslaught.
IN DRAGO'S CORNER:
DRAGO is outraged. He shakes his fist in his son's face.

DRAGO
What are you doing?! Put him down!

IN ROCKY'S CORNER:

ROCKY'S TEAM works on ADONIS. He is hurt but not swollen yet.
100.

ANTHONY
Amazing, brother, amazing!
CUT TO:

INT. APPLEBEE'S RESTAURANT

ROBERT watching his father tending to Adonis as the cornermen
work on him. The crowd is supporting ADONIS.
CUT TO:

IN ROCKY'S CORNER:

ROCKY
Forget the toe to toe "pride" crap!
He's stronger!! Always will be, got
it? But don't tell me he's tougher!
Use ya brains and not ya guts, be
mean, but be smart! YA GOTTA STAY
CLOSE!!

IN DRAGO'S CORNER:

VITOR
Don't come out!

VITOR rises. Drago GLARES across the ring at ROCKY with PURE
HATRED.

ROCKY
Expect the pain an' give it back!

The BELL RINGS.

VITOR rushes out of his corner and starts to FIRE OUT JABS
that Adonis drops low and slips.

The style is TOTALLY DIFFERENT. He is BOBBING AND WEAVING.

COMMENTATOR #2 (0.S.)
Creed wisely seems to have switched
to Plan B. Hoping to close the
distance!

VITOR is pounding away. ADONIS manages to SLIP half of them.
THE OTHERS LANDS WITH JARRING FORCE!

ROCKY
Side to side!

VITOR is actually playing to the crowd. He MOTIONS for them
to CHEER him on harder.

COMMENTATOR #1 (0.S.)
vitor Drago is toying with Creed!

ROCKY
Ya getting closer, roll!!
101.

DRAGO
(screaming)
Hit the bastard!!

VITOR loops a straight RIGHT HAND and Adonis SLIPS IT and
FIRES a leaping LEFT HOOK that catches the beast flush on the
nose.

BLOOD seeps from Vitor's nose!

COMMENTATOR #1 (0.S.)
Oh, a beautifully timed leaping
hook from Creed bloodies the big
man's nose! Maybe it's broken!

COMMENTATOR #2 (0.S.)
Here comes Creed!

CUT TO:
INT. CREED MANSION
MARY ANNE nearly leaps with excitement.

Like an ENRAGED BULL, VITOR shoves ADONIS.

VITOR rushes forward, and throwing a THREE PUNCH COMBO, DROPS
ADONIS!!
COMMENTATOR #1 (0.S.)
A clean combo drops Adonis in his
tracks, but miraculously, he is up
at the count of three!!

ADONIS is up immediately. VITOR stands several feet away,
TAUNTING Adonis.

The REFEREE tries to push him away to a neutral corner.
CUT TO:

INT. RING

Angry, ADONIS looks at ROCKY who indicates he's okay.
102.
COMMENTATOR #1 (0.S.)
One thing for sure, Creed has a
hell of a jaw to take that last
shot! I don't know how but his eyes
look clear and he's up at seven.
IN ROCKY'S CORNER:

ROCKY
Stay close and crack that body!

IN DRAGO'S CORNER:

VITOR raises his fist in victory.

DRAGO
Finish it!
CUT TO:
INT. APPLEBEE'S RESTAURANT

VIEWER
».. He's as tough as ya old man!
ROBERT tenses.
ROBERT
«+. No way.
CUT TO:

INT. RINGSIDE

COMMENTATOR #1 (0.S.)
Because of Drago's failure to go
directly to a neutral corner, Creed
has a few precious seconds to clear
his head!

The REFEREE motions for both men to continue fighting.

VITOR DRAGO, oozing confidence, holds his RIGHT FIST in the
air.

VITOR
Where you want it? Where do ya want
it?!

VITOR jabs and drives Adonis back into the CORNER.

ROCKY
Circle - Clear ya head!!
103.

ADONIS unloads a COMBINATION that STUNS Vitor and digs to the
ribs.

ROCKY (CONT'D)
Keep poundin'!

The PUNCHES are coming with AMAZING SPEED!

VITOR tries to get off the ropes but ADONIS puts his head on

INT. RING

Vitor HEAVES Adonis back into a CORNER and pounds Adonis's
head.

INT. ARENA
BIANCA: The crowd noise is overwhelming. The pain is evident.

BIANCA
Cover up. Oh, God.

She takes out her HEARING AIDS and the ROAR of the stadium
noise drops 90::percent::... It is an eerie contrast.

INT. RING

Adonis DOUBLE HOOKS Vitor, who answers back with a left hook.
The BELL RINGS and ADONIS hits him after the bell.

ADONIS
Hurts, don't it?!

VITOR
(outraged)
I'll kill you!

ADONIS

Ain't killin' nobody.

The MEN are separated and the CROWD is on their feet.

you doing! Knock him out!

VITOR
You're weak, you LOST!

IN _ROCKY'S CORNER:

ROCKY steps in front as ADONIS sits. ANTHONY hands him the
water. They lock eyes for a second.

ROCKY
How ya feelin'?

ADONIS
Hurting - Your style sucks.

ROCKY
I know, but it's working -

The BELL RINGS.

COMMENTATOR #1 (0.S.)
We got what is shaping up to be a
very competitive fight! It's gonna
be a rough one!

ROCKY
Go for it! You're the best!

ANTHONY
Get it, brother!

The FIGHT now goes into a MONTAGE (approximately 3:30) of the
men exchanging punishing blows and the tides shifting in each
men's favor.

The CROWD is swept up in the DRAMA. People cannot believe
ADONIS is still on his feet and INFLICTING DAMAGE on the
Russian behemoth.
105.

The BATTLE becomes an engrossing display of GUTS, DIGNITY and
SHEER WILL to win on Adonis's behalf.

Adonis will PUNISH and BE PUNISHED by a powerful foe. Even
when knocked down, he rises and charges into the heat of
battle.

The use of SPEED CHANGE, COLOR PALETTE, OPTICAL EFFECTS and
insights into the men's SUBCONSCIOUS, as well as the
fighters' P.O.V. while enduring extraordinary pain yet really
pushing forward in pursuit of victory, will all be on
display.

11th ROUND:

The ninth round ends as expected in a FURIOUS exchange: Vitor
PULVERIZING Adonis with two shots to the liver.

Adonis's KNEES BUCKLE but somehow he stays upright and
battles back!

As the BELL RINGS, the two men have to be separated. DRAGO
roughly shoves ROCKY aside as he leads his battered son back
to his corner.

ROCKY ignores DRAGO and helps ADONIS to the corner.

INT. APPLEBEE'S RESTAURANT

The TV cuts to ROCKY attending to Adonis in the corner.

LOGAN
That's my grandfather!

INT. RINGSIDE

BUDDY "KING" CHARLES is not enjoying what should have been an
easy VICTORY.

ADONIS
Hard to breathe.

ROCKY
I know, kid, I know -

ANTHONY
You got this -

IN _DRAGO'S CORNER:

Drago GLARES into his son's bruised face.
106.

DRAGO
He is beaten! Finish him!!

VITOR remains silent, amazed ADONIS is still present.
IN _ADONIS'S CORNER:
ADONIS swallows deep breaths.

ROCKY
Everything is saying "No more". But
don't listen, don't hear nothin'
except ya brain sayin' "I can do
it! I can do it!" - Say it - "I can
do it!"

ADONIS
I can do it!

The BELL RINGS. The FIGHTERS RISE.

ROCKY
Vicious.

The TWO FIGHTERS come to center ring. The REFEREE indicates
to touch gloves. Vitor refuses.

VITOR
(spits)
Toe to toe.

ADONIS
I'm here.

The TWO FIGHTERS square off. VITOR now resembles a GHASTLY
reminder of his father in his prime.

ADONIS is no longer fighting FLATFOOTED and in a classic
boxer's crouch.

He now RESEMBLES his old self: UPRIGHT, LIGHTER ON HIS FEET.
This has VITOR confused.

Vitor's BLOODY SNEER stretches across his face as he waves
the ENERGIZED Adonis forward.

VITOR charges and Adonis side-steps and avoids the rush
again.

He still has NOT THROWN A PUNCH. The crowd is getting
agitated.

COMMENTATOR #1 (0.S.)
Creed was having success with his
crouching style of fighting and for
some reason, he has abandoned it.
107.

COMMENTATOR #2 (0.S.)
Now he's back to his normal style -
Maybe not a good idea.

COMMENTATOR #3 (0.S.)
Drago continues to charge like a
wounded bear. They are exchanging
words!

VITOR
Fight! C'mon! Bring it!!

ADONIS
You're too slow.

VITOR tries to cut him off and ADONIS slips out of the
corner.

He LUNGES again.
COMMENTATOR #1 (0.S.)
What are they doing! Now it's a war
of words!

ADONIS circles to his left, pointing.

ADONIS
Ya got nothin'!

VITOR
c'mon!

INCENSED, IVAN DRAGO pounds the ring apron.

DRAGO
(in Russian)
Get him!
CUT TO:

VITOR throws and ADONIS slips and COUNTERS which catches

VITOR is on the ropes. Adonis PUMMELS him with HOOKS and
RIGHTS to the head and body that has the Big Man staggering
and WINCING in pain with each body shot.

DRAGO
Fight back!!

VITOR manages to SHOVE Adonis off. He hits him with an UPPER-
CUT that rocks him!

ADONIS attacks with UNBELIEVABLE FURY. He hits with rapid
fire PUNCHES to the body and head!!

Both men are very EXHAUSTED but still dangerous. They now
settle in and throw all CAUTION ASIDE. They go TOE TO TOE!

VITOR
(bellowing)
Come on!!

ADONIS and VITOR exchange heavy blows, neither man willing to
concede. ADONIS then uncorks a huge hook that staggers the
BEAST BACKWARDS.

As if chopping down a tree, Creed fires shot after shot into
his NEMESIS, but VITOR, exhausted, tries to rally back. He
staggers Adonis with his last powerful blow, which Adonis
absorbs and attacks back until VITOR STUMBLES BACK and
COLLAPSES THUNDEROUSLY to the canvas floor!!
109.

ADONIS looks at ROCKY and GESTURES SKYWARD then CHARGES
FORWARD, raising his hand IN VICTORY.

ROCKY and his corner CLIMB IN to celebrate.
CUT TO:

INT. APPLEBEE'S RESTAURANT- NIGHT

The CROWD applauds and several of ROBERT'S ACQUAINTANCES
compliment him and LOGAN. He watches the IMAGE of ADONIS
hugging BIANCA and ROCKY.

ROBERT finally smiles and gestures towards the TV.

ROBERT
Special, huh.
CUT TO:

INT. RING
Drago GLARES at Vitor and shakes his head in DISGUST.

BIANCA hugs her man.

BIANCA
You were incredible! I love you!!

The RING fills up with PRESS and HANGER-ONS. The SHOWTIME
ANNOUNCER enters the ring and addresses Adonis.

SHOWTIME ANNOUNCER
Adonis, could we have a word with
you, over here please.

ROCKY sees IVAN DRAGO staring aggressively at him. ADONIS
stands with ROCKY, BIANCA, ANTHONY, and PADMAN while being
interviewed.

ADONIS
I wanna give a shout out to Rocky,
who helped me get it back, and
Bianca,

ADONIS (CONT'D)
mother of our beautiful child,
impossible to live without - And
dedicate this to our father's
memory - Love ya, Pops - Thank you.
It's been a lot of hell, but worth
it!

BIANCA kisses him and the scene fades.
DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. ARENA - NIGHT
The FANS are now dispersing into the cold night air.
INT. EXIT TUNNELS - NIGHT

The ADONIS TEAM has loaded up the SUVS and are preparing to
leave. ADONIS and BIANCA stand in the snow.

ADONIS
C'mon, Unc -

ADONIS gets into the SUV.
ROCKY exits, carrying his GYM BAG. He starts down the HALLWAY
and pauses. He backtracks around the CORNER.

CUT TO:
INT. ARENA

Slightly open locker room door.

ROCKY looks in and sees VITOR, beaten and facing the wall,
MORALLY DEFEATED, ASHAMED.

ROCKY pushes the door open a touch more and sees DRAGO with
his hand on his son's shoulder, quietly consoling him.

ADONIS silently steps into view behind ROCKY.

DRAGO feels their presence and turns, almost embarrassed. He
rises and unnervingly approaches.

VIOLENCE appears inevitable.
Inches apart, ROCKY and DRAGO lock eyes for a heavy moment.

ADONIS is on alert.

At the last moment, ROCKY averts his eyes and directs his
vision to the defeated son, VITOR.

DRAGO too slowly turns and looks at his son, then refaces
ROCKY. The meaning is clear. It's Over. Help your only son...

ROCKY steps back and closes the door.

ROCKY
Yo... Ya did pretty good.

ADONIS
(laughs)
».. Vicious enough?
111.

ROCKY
I've see it done better.

ADONIS
By who? You?

ROCKY
Absolutely.

ADONIS
Know what's cool? Growin' old
gracefully.

ROCKY
+.. But ungracefully is more fun.

ADONIS
I wouldn't know.

ROCKY
++. You will.

ROCKY walks with ADONIS into the night.

FADE OUT.
