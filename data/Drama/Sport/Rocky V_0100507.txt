Rocky, PAULIE, DUKE (TONY) and ADRIAN are swept along
by the adoring crowd. The entourage disappears around

multitude of Russian VOICES shouting uncensored praise
REVERBERATES down the cement corridors... The Russians

You come through like a champ.

Yo, Rocky, the giant killer of
Philadelphia! Way to punch out

The stunned crowd surges around the fallen fighter.

PAULIE
Rocko, what's wrong? Get back

Every ounce of strength appears to have been drained
from Rocky's body. Rivets of sweat cascade down his -
forehead and chest... he shivers slightly.

ADRIAN
Somebody please get a doctor!
ROCKY
Everythin's spinnin’.
ADRIAN
Don't get up. Paulie, get some
help.

DUKE

Rocky Balboa, stay where you are!
This is George Washington Duke
welcoming you home, champ!

ROCKY JR.
This is radical!

. DUKE
People, please hold it where you
are!

A large black man in his fifties approaches. His name
is GEORGE WASHINGTON DUKE, raconteur, playboy and ultra
successful fight promoter. At his side is his
assistant and yes man par excellence, MERLIN SHEETS.

He is in his late thirties or early forties, he is of
average or slightly below average height. Even though
he has a perennial smile stretched across his face, his ~
eyes radiate a pit bull tenacity. Beside Merlin is a
burly black heavyweight fighter named UNION CANE. With
his close cropped or shaved head Cane radiates a power-
ful presence, he is in his middle thirties, a civil
man.

DUKE
You did such an extraordinary job,
champ, you deserve a royal welcome
home, and here it is!
Congratulations for a wonderful
performance, champ.

ROCKY
Thanks -- this is Adrian.

ADRIAN
Hello. Rocky, it's cold here and
you have people waiting.

Rocky, there were rumors of some
physical complications after the
fight.

Rocky is at a loss.

ADRIAN
That's what they are, rumors.
He's very healthy.

REPORTER #2
Rocky, is there going to be a
rematch?

ROCKY
No thanks. I sees a dog in the
audience, that's a cute animal!

PAULIE
(to Adrian)
Nobody ever asks me a question.

Duke, Cane, and Merlin enter the room.

REPORTER #3
Rocky, recently the American
Medical Association said that
prize fighting should be banned.
Do you agree with the doctors?

ROCKY
Absolutely, doctors should never
fight.

DUKE

(steps forward)
Champ, that was a beautiful answer!
That's right, keep the doctors out
of the ring! Now I would like to
digress from the questions and
present a little exciting
proposition for the media. Now
everyone in this city and certainly
the world of sports knows my
reputation of promoting some of the
finest extravaganzas in this
country...

Timing's the essence of life,

not just an ordinary title fight,
but an international superstar

event.

MERLIN
The first of its kind! None like
it!

DUKE

I'm layin' out the groundwork for
a fantastic extravaganza. A super
mighty fight to be held in Japan
that will be called “Lettin' it go
in Tokyo." I've been breakin
alotta bread with my little
Japanese brothers an' they have
put their millions where their
mouth is! So brother, what I have
on paper is the largest guarantee
ever offered to a champion on this
earth! Man, they do love you over

America! So, Rocky, all I need is
your blessing and you and Union
Cane will be part of the richest
event to ever hit the Orient!

ADRIAN
No, I don't think that's possible.

DUKE
Mrs. Balboa, you're not against your
husband being an international
ambassador of sports?

ADRIAN
No, but I am against my husband
getting hurt anymore.

DUKE
Well, he looks prime-time to me.

MERLIN
The "Dream Machine" never looked
better.

DUKE
Ain't that the truth. That's what
you are to folks, the “Dream
Machine," a world class champ. And
a world class champ's gotta be part
of the planet, so can I say that in
front of the press here -- Balboa
vs. Cane in Japan for the title?

ADRIAN
No you can't.

MERLIN
Rocky, wait, George wants you to
think about putting on those damn
gloves again an’ picking up a hell
of a payday, hear?

ROCKY
(unconvincingly)
I'm retired officially.

Tommy's close enough to hear what's transpiring.

DUKE
Bullshit to that notion, brother.
Let me lay out some data an'
facts. You do have marquee value,
because you do put butts in the
buckets, I'm talkin' asses in the
seats! A businessman with any
sort of brain don't expire an’
retire when he can put asses into
seats unless he’s sittin' on his
own brain! Only in America do we
get these opportunities! Only
here!

MERLIN
George, Rocky's got the picture,
he knows he's got the touch.

ROCKY
What's the story?

DUKE
Union Cane's gonna be champ soon,
fact of life. When he is,
challenge him an‘ damn if you
won't be right back on your sweet
feet with this one match-up.
‘Cause people love comebacks, they
love longshots, they love fairy
tales, an’ brother, there's
nothin’ in boxing more ultra
commercial than an ultra fairy
tale comeback of a down-on-his-
luck snow-white underdog! Hell,
ya'll be too rich to bitch! Like
Mark Twain once said, "Virtue has

ting it down, he switches off the light.

As he stares towards the elevated basement window that
glows gray from the streetlights, the SOUND of a dis-

full of fire. His opponent is knocked-out cold.

Rocky and company leap into the ring.

Tommy waves to Duke who waves back. Karen climbs onto

kisses Tommy. The scene FREEZES and becomes a front

There are twenty other chic guests milling around. A
beautiful Christmas tree adorns the room.
DUKE
This is it, Tommy.
TOMMY
What's that?

DUKE
What it's all about, having the
best, like Karen here. Knowing
the best, wearing the best, but to
keep it up ya gotta be on top.

I appreciate you doing this for

My pleasure, but you gotta realize
this is a business and money's the
name of the game. Tommy, you're a
hungry boy, am I right?

TOMMY
Yeah, I have an appetite, who
doesn't.

KAREN
I like that.

DUKE

Well, me too. I'm hungry to
promote the best fighters in the
world. If that's a character
flaw, then hell, I'm flawed to the
bone!
(laughs) -
Now, I checked with the Boxing
Commission. There's no contract
between you and Balboa.

Nothin', just a handshake.

Rocky's shadow, peopie callin’ you
his puppet.

MERLIN
I don't believe I know anybody who
coulda put up with it as long as
you have.

TOMMY
Yeah?

DUKE
Hanging on to him is dead
weight. He belongs to the past
like a damn dinosaur. He's a pug,
I'm a businessman, an‘ as long as
he's your man, ya gonna watch the
Parade go by. Man, you haven't
made the big payday yet, an' ya -
won't until ya fight the top
contenders; and those contenders,
Tommy, I do surely own. Make no
mistake about it, a great white
hope who can hold the title is
worth, an' I know you won't
believe it, well over a hundred
million dollars. But hell, you've
gotta make the move. Look at this
place, my intentions are clear.

TOMMY
(mesmerized)
I want a shot at Cane and the
title now, so all I have to do is
play the game?

MERLIN
There you go, but what about
Balboa? He won't want to give up
control?

TOMMY
Control? It's my life, right?

Yes it is.

never had me sign no papers.

TOMMY
So you're lucky you didn't have to
play the game. I ain't runnin’ up

It's you who's being twisted, not
him. He's what he is, you're what
you are, but you can't understand

No, you can't. What we got is

Mick had. We cover each other, -

ADRIAN
Tt's not him, it's you! You're

what you're doing, an' I feel for:
you because, as much as we lost,
you lost everything.

Get what back?! You can't turn
back the clocks. we live here, we

ROCKY
I know where we live, r can look

ADRIAN

But not your heart! You can't
give him that because it won't

you never beat, you never beat any -
of them with muscle, you beat them
with heart. Yes, they took

never take away your heart, an‘
that's the part I love about you
most. Tommy maybe makes you feel
like you're winnin', but you're
