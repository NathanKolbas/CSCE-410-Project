REVISED SHOOTING SCRIPT

May 1, 1999

fulfillment to all he holds dear -- is
that moment when he has worked his heart

FADE IN:

EXT. "SHARK" STADIUM (MIAMI, USA) - LATE DAY Al
(ANY SUNDAY)

MUSIC sets a mood of mystery, verdure, sky... Grass sways
gently in the wind, silence to the world... Then a

football is placed in the grass. The large, taped
knuckles of a center grasp the football for the snap.
The world is still, coiled like a spring...

CREDITS RUN...

GAME 1 MINNESOTA AMERICANS AT MIAMI SHARKS - FIELD #1 - 1
CONTINUOUS ACTION

An EXPLOSION on the field -- as bodies crash against each
other like armies. The game as played and felt in "the pit".

A swift, short pass over the middle... A tight end
(Miami) takes the hit... Then the quarterback (Miami)
goes down hard. A blur of motion. A WHISTLE BLOWS and
referee #1 signals first down; chains are moved.

HELICOPTER #1 2

A steep view of the proceedings -- godlike, evoking
ghosts, wind; as if the football gods look down on their
human combatants and vote for first downs, touchdowns,
careers, lives... These overheads punctuate the film...
The silence lingers briefly -- before the Announcers'
voices bring us back to the media reality of the late
20th Century...

TUG KOLOWSKI (V.O.)
(on TV)

«+. And what a beautiful day for
football it is here in South
Florida!! It's Sunday, and the
sun is shining and playoff berths
are on the line. It doesn't get
much better than this! Don't you
think so, Kevin?!

KEVIN BRANSON (V.O.)
(on TV)
That's the one thing you and I can
agree on, Tug. You can almost
feel religion in the air here at
Miami's 'Shark' Stadium.

The MUSIC THEME -- a blend of martial, choral, and rock
and roll -- is now swallowed in the ROAR of the CROWD...

SMASH CUT TO:
FIELD #2

«+. the technicolor eyes of quarterback JACK "CAP"
ROONEY, hostage to anger and pain, as his aging frame
crashes on the dirty grass.

SIDELINE #1
Head coach TONY D'AMATO, a striking, intense man in his

50s, moves in a five-yard swath of the sideline, his eyes
flicking worriedly to his fallen alter-ago.

TONY
I've been doin' this for too many
years...
(at McKenna)
You mother...!!! Goddamn ass...!!!

He's giving it to Leslie McKenna, the right guard, and
the other linemen, as he senses the game is now shifting
momentum -- against him.

TONY
.»». ‘mother!... you candy ass...
no blockin' bitches!... 68?!
McKenna, get your brain-dead head
out of your ass!! You're not
blocking, you're tip-toeing through
the tulips!

 

SIDELINE #2

DR. ALLIE POWERS, 30s, the new internist with the team,
grabs his doctor box and starts onto the field.

TONY
Powers! Get the hell back here!
Where you going?! He's fine!

Powers sheepishly u-turns back to the sideline where DR.
HARVEY MANDRAKE, the grey-haired team orthopedist, gives
him a second scolding.

MANDRAKE
What are you thinking, Allie?!
There's 1:43 on the clock! You
walk on that field after the 2-
minute warning and we
automatically lose a time-out.
Wake-up! You been here almost a
goddamn season!

POWERS
Sorry -- I thought he was hurt.
FIELD #3

As LESLIE McKENNA (#63), the big right guard, helps Cap
up, knowing he's blown the block.

TUG (V.O.)

Yes, sir! That's the real deal
right there. Cap Rooney... Two
Pantheon Cups. Almost 50,000
passing yards. More touchdowns
than I care to remember...

CAP
(vising, to McKenna)
McKenna, you fat bubble of lard!
One more block like that, you'll
end my career!

TUG (V.O.)

«+. Our computers rank Jack Rooney
one of the top five quarterbacks
of all time when it comes to
pressure situations... At 39 he
may be a step or two behind -- 12
off-season operations have a way
of doing that to you -- but he
still stands head and shoulders
above these new kids...

WIVES' SECTION #1 (VIDEO)

CINDY ROONEY, a sweet-looking blonde, waves back as she
notices the electronic eye gazing down on her; other
wives join in.

BRANSON (V.O.)
.. Without a doubt, Tug! ‘'Rock'
Rooney also happens to be married
to a heckuva nice gal sittin' down
there in the stands just like the
star struck fan she's been since
their college days together at
Michigan -- that's Cindy Rooney,
folks, and I can tell you...

TUG (V.O.)
Stop boasting, Kev! But beautiful
she certainly is, un-hunh!... Anda

mother of three beautiful children...

consults his plastic-coated single-page game plan, into
his mouthpiece:

(relays call)
Okay! Slot Right Switch 90 or 99

SIDELINE #4 10

TYLER CHERUBINI, the stoic, 32-year-old perpetual back-up
quarterback relays the telex signal from upstairs, on his
headset to the field via walkie-talkie -- in addition to
various body signals, both legitimate and deceptive.

HUDDLE #1 11

QB Cap Rooney bangs on his helmet; something in the
electronics is off. He glares at his teammates, and
though at times he chews them out like a Marine sergeant,
there is an unmistakable affection for his line. He
tries his hardest, like an aging Boy Scout, not to curse,
not always successfully.

CAP
Damn headset! Never goddamn works
when you get hit!! Every damn

 

time! Damnit, Madman! That
sonofabitch is headhunting!

CAP (CONT'D)
Hold him, rip out his goddamn
eyes, but don't let him mess with
me! I'm too goddamn old!

PATRICK KELLY, his massive right tackle, known around the
league as "MADMAN," bleeds from his nose, but adores his
QB.

MADMAN
Cap, I'll keep him off ya even if
I gotta bite off his thumb!

CAP
You do that!
(to SANDERSON, the
star wide receiver)
«+. Get yourself open, goddamnit,
‘Sandman.' If you gotta coldcock
him, I'll find you.

SANDERSON
Hey I'm there, Cap! In the wind.
Just fling it, baby!

CAP

(to the second wide

receiver)
‘Zonker'! You're number two, get
open, run your dig route at 15...

(to the huddle)
Okay, listen up, Slot Right Switch
90 or 99 Cadillac, check with me,
and kill any sonofabitch tries to
cross that line before his time!
On three. Ready!

They clap and break. With 15 seconds to play time, the
constant barrage of "voices" inside Cap's helmet ceases.

MEDIA BOOTH #1 12

TUG KOLOWSKI -- in the flesh -- is a boisterous, boozy,
veteran sportscaster, alongside KEVIN BRANSON, a young and
upcoming TV-type who seems Tug's opposite, bland and safe.

TUG
... But not all is paradise here in
Miami. Cap Rooney may be on his way
into the record books, but for Coach
Tony D'Amato it's been a dismal
season with attendance sliding, as
the crosstown Dolphins prosper...

STANDS #1 (VIDEO) 13

Reveals the stadium at two-thirds capacity.

SIDELINE #5 (VIDEO AND FILM) Al3

Tony, on TV display, talking intensely into his headset,
takes us past defensive coordinator MONTEZUMA MONROE --
60s, a monument of a man, former star linebacker, now
limping noticeably. He glares strongly, rarely moves.
With him is 34-year-old vet LUTHER LAVAY, linebacker and
the captain of the defense, black, built, and a total
predator. His nickname: "SHARK."

TUG (V.O.)
... With three straight losses and
a slide from four years ago when
they won two Pantheon Cups in a row,
D'Amato's going to have to
struggle to get his aging team
into the playoffs! But today is
looking good for the Sharks,
leading the Americans in the second
quarter, 21-17.

BRANSON (V.O.)
«+. They still got those holes in
that offensive line, Tug, but the
biggest problem has got to be the
defense, and Montezuma Monroe
knows it...

An ASSISTANT offers Monroe a set of digitally-produced
enhancements of the Minnesota offensive formations.

MONROE
Get that shit outta my face!
Shark -- what the fuck's goin' on

out there?! We gotta get more
pressure on the goddamn
quarterback! That motherfucker's
splitting our seam 15 yards every
goddamn time. Now fix it!

SHARK
I'm on it, Coach.

He stomps toward the defensive unit.

BRANSON (V.O.)
... there's also of course the
impact of management decisions on
the Sharks' turn in fortunes...

OWNER'S BOX #1 (VIDEO) 14

As seen on TV, several family friends and VPs mill
around, but we only see the back of elegantly-attired
blonde President and co-owner, CHRISTINA PAGNIACCI.

TUG (V.O.)
No question, Kev! Since the death
of ‘Big Daddy,' Art Pagniacci --

his daughter and new President of
the team, Christina Pagniacci has
made some -- many people think --
questionable financial decisions in
letting three All-Pro Bowl selections
leave town for free agency.

BRANSON (V.O.)

++. although she did bring Julian
Washington in from K.C. A big
1500-yard back...

FIELD #4 (VIDEO AND FILM) 15

JULIAN WASHINGTON, 27, an extremely strong, sexy,
solidly-built, 230-pound running back, sets, his teeth
blazing with jewelry and facial paint on the far edges of
the Association's rule book (The Associated Football
Franchise of America). He presently goes into play-
motion.

TUG (V.O.)
«+. who can be great when he's not
hurt. And his heart's in it. And
here we go!

Rooney barks out the numbers, "hot reading" the coming
blitz. The clock slows, as his eyes flick from the key
safety to his own team. Can they handle the confusion
of the audible?

ROONEY
(audibling)
Set! Blue 83... check, check...
Arizona 99 Cadillac, Arizona 99
Cadillac! Hut! Hut! Hut!

The Shark linemen read the shift... but Madman is clearly
confused... blocking assignments are missed.

Cap takes the snap and fades back to pass, but he's an
inch too slow and a year too old -- his arm in the air,
about to release, he is brutally blind-sided by a fast
reptilian defensive end. Simultaneously, a blitzing
safety hits him in the lower back with his helmet. Cap
goes down hard again, landing on his own blocker's helmet
at an awkward angle -- he screams loudly -- and this
time, nothing moves.

SIDELINE #6 16

Tony is looking at his worst fear come true. An eerie
quiet momentarily pervades the stadium. D'Amato breaks
it, yelling at Dr. Powers.

TONY
Get the hell out there! Move!
Can't you see he's hurt?

WIVES' SECTION #2 17

Cindy Rooney shares the uncertainty.

OWNER'S BOX #2 18

Still standing with her back to the window, Christina
talks to a friend.

CHRISTINA

finance committee, I have zero
say on network negot...

As she becomes aware of the hush in the stadium, she
turns to look -- then up at the TV for the slo-mo replay.

BRANSON (V.O.)
... Every Shark fan has a
sickening feeling in the pit of
their stomach at this moment. I
know I do. Cap Rooney is down and
in obvious pain.

CHRISTINA
Dammit! Who was on the weakside
safety?! Was that McKenna, you

She reaches for a red phone.

Oww -- my butt! It's like a knife

The stadium applauds as Cap hobbles up to his feet.

SIDELINE #7 22

Back-up QB Tyler Cherubini nervously jams index cards with
play calls under the clear plastic holders inside his
special wristband, intersecting Coach D'Amato.

TONY
Nice and easy, Ty, okay. We're up
21-17. Hold on. Steady ‘em.

Cherubini AD LIBS and jogs onto the field. Fans stomp
their feet in sync with the driving beat of the
inspirational "Shark Theme."

BRANSON (V.O.)
We're back! And Cap Rooney looks
to be all right. Listen to that
crowd!

Cap crosses towards the bench on the shoulders of Powers
and Trainer #1. Tony intersects briefly, but he doesn't
seem to want to confront this, makes light of it.

TONY
You all right, '‘Rock'?

From the BOOTH POV -- the team claps and breaks from the
huddle.

TUG (V.O.)
Hate to tell you, Kev, it's a
little scarier than that. Tyler
Cherubini hasn't thrown for a
first down all season!... but it's
going to take a nail and a coffin
to keep Cap down on the farm
warming the pine. This may only

Tyler Cherubini scans the defense, sees all the signs for
another impending blitz.

CHERUBINI

Check, check! Black 90 Razor,
Black 90 Razor! -- Hut! Hut!

Minnesota attacks with everything they've got...
Cherubini never even sees the light of day as he is
buried, coughing up the ball -- which bounces into the
hands of a surprised Minnesota safety -- who sprints
20-some yards into the Miami end zone for a touchdown!

The fans go wild with rage, booing the fallen Cherubini.

BRANSON (V.O.)
Oh my gosh! Touchdown! And the
Americans go up 23-21. Man-o-man!
Did they nail him! He's...
Cherubini's not getting up!

Oh, Jesus! Vincent, get me the

A young woman raised to appreciate football, her outburst
quiets the dozen people partying in the box. Her mother,
MARGARET PAGNIACCI, an elegant older woman, who looks out
of it, mostly quasi-drunk or drugged, though she does a
superb job of concealing this with her fixed and
dignified expression, inquires:

shifting position, confusing him; the crowd is deafening,
the cameras zooming in, the sun blazing.

MINNESOTA TACKLE

Willie intensely scans the defensive alignment. All talk
ceases when he yells:

WILLIE
Set Red 378! Red 378! Hut! Hut!
Willie steps back a little too fast and too far. He
spins towards Washington, awkwardly handing the ball off
on a delayed slant... Washington shoots into a different
hole than assigned -- a dangerous runner, gaining ten
yards from nothing.

In the backfield, the taunting defensive end slaps
Willie's helmet hard as the whistle blows. Willie barely

‘Less you tell me you love me,

The defense picks up on it instantly and goes after
Willie loudly. Embarrassed, he makes his adjustment --
but too late. A flag flies. Delay of game penalty.

Tony throws up his hands and rolls his eyes. There goes
the field goal!
PRESS BOX #1 - JACK "RIPPER" ROSE 45

Christina leans forward to watch. Willie fades back to

FIELD #15 47

The rush is on again. Willie, scrambling out of the
pocket, avoids several tacklers, but his eyes give away

the 25-yard pass... The defensive back steals it from
Sanderson and runs it back 10 yards. The crowd roars

with disappointment. Referee #1 whistles -- ending the
half.

SIDELINE #17 48

Coach D'Amato shakes his head, picked up by the TV
cameras.

TUG (V.O.)
That was bound to happen, the way
this kid's movin'. Too fast, just

too fast. He's gotta be nervous

out there! He's ahead of his

INT. SHARK LOCKER ROOM - LOCKER ROOM #1 - HALFTIME - 49
NIGHT

With 10 minutes to go, the offense is concentrated in one
part of the room on chairs, the defense in the other --
listening to analyses and looking at video pictures from
their respective coaches.

TRAINER'S AREA #1 50

Madman's got the flu, and is dehydrated enough to require
two I.V.s in either arm. Dr. Powers reads his
thermometer.

POWERS
101... You light-headed?

MADMAN
I was light-headed at kick-off,
Doc. Now I'm at the ‘one foot in
the coffin' stage.

POWERS
You're a couple of quarts low,
Madman, you just need an oil
change...

MADMAN
Yeah, then why are my legs one big
knot, Doc!? I need some
cyclobenzaprine...
Powers sees Dr. Mandrake hurry past, follows him.

POWERS
Harvey, just a sec...!

Mandrake barely breaks, waits.

POWERS
I'm worried about Cap -- he's
losing ankle strength. I think
he's got...
MANDRAKE

heads toward a small exam room where Cap waits alone --

bypassing Cherubini, the forgotten QB, waiting to have
his knee examined, attended to by TRAINER #2, a

stutterer.
TRAINER #2
Doc, what about Rhodes? He's
really in p-p-pain...
MANDRAKE
He's a hypochondriac. Give him
some ibuprofen.
TRAINER #2
He doesn't wanna put that sh-shit

Siberia as an ice hockey doctor?
Tell him to clench his teeth.
CHERUBINI

Well, I think m-m-maybe I can get
him to t-t-take some Alka-Seltzer.
52 EXAM AREA #1 52

Mandrake closes the door on Trainer #2. Cap is with

Three minutes!

MADMAN

MADMAN

He goes, IVs trailing, Powers calls out to Trainer #1 for
help.

LOCKER ROOM #2

With shouts of "Get out of the way!", "Coming through!",
Powers and Trainer #2, protecting the I.V.'s,
follow a surging Madman into the bathroom.

Madman kicks open a broken stall and finds an unlucky
rookie staring back at him.

MADMAN
Rookie, this is reserved! Get the
fuck out!

Terrified, the rookie runs out; then Madman forces his
way in, managing to squeeze Powers, Trainer #2 and
himself into the stall.

POWERS
Don't bend your elbows...

Crozier, studying a stack of computer printouts, enters.

CROZIER
Madman? Yo! You there...?

He whacks on the door, which opens on Madman sitting with
his pants around his ankles, I.V.s entering each
outstretched arm, ministered to by Trainer #1 and Dr.
Powers. Crozier is amused but hardly surprised; to
Madman:

CROZIER
The three technique is really
getting up field on you. We're
gonna rub him with a fullback this
half.

MADMAN
Coach, let's run the draw or let
me cut his ass on the screens.

TONY
Look, you the offense, why do
you think we work on the blitz
package all week? We've lost two
quarterbacks in one half of
football ‘cause our line can't
pick up a goddamn backside bandit
on max protection!! You and I
know this is goddamn stupid
football, and you're stressing
this shit outta me! We've worked
on the calls over and over again
but you have no goddamn focus or
concentration! McKenna, keep your
head on a swivel, you've got to
slide out there and pick up that
robber -- roll up those outside
linebackers! Beamen, know your
site adjustments! Sanderson and
Fox will break off their routes
but you have to deliver it on
time. We've had two goddamn
turnovers this half, you guys are
dumping on my turnover ratio.

You the defense, you've got to
create something out there, you've
got to start flying around the
fucking ball and hitting somebody.
Don't let these assholes chew up
the clock on us! On first down,
they're killing us with the
weakside slant. Corners, when we
put eight in the box, you've got
to jam the receivers, take ‘em on,
you're hesitating! If you're
gonna make a mistake, go on! Make
it a big one! I'm not gonna eat
your lunch for that, but don't
fuck around like pussies at a pee
party, you hear me?!... P.J., Mac,
Beast Man, Horny, Shark! One, two
yards less each time and they'll be
two and eight instead of two and
six! Stuff the goddamn run.
They're killing us!

No more stupid penalties, okay?!
Concentrate. Focus. We're only
down by three points. We can win

of losing! Are you?! Three losses
in a row.

who rises laconically.

A tense moment -- then all bust up laughing, including

EXT. TUNNEL - NIGHT 56

Winter's night has now fallen as the team hollers,
exiting a narrow tunnel onto the field. The stadium is
charming but decayed (1930s WPA architecture) and in need
of significant renovation...

Jimmy Sanderson, the young star wide receiver for the
Sharks, repeatedly adjusts his shoulder pads, talking to
himself as he walks; he is all hands and nerves, a
thoroughbred with a sweet personality.

SANDERSON
I am precision-honed, muscular-
tempered steel. My moves are
cosmic. Time to save the day.
My legs, torso and arms are
energized powerthrust dominant
weapons... I can save the day!

SHARK
(bypassing Willie)
Who's that you're throwing to,
kid? The receiver or you got some
other shit on your mind?

Willie gets the message. Several fans, intoxicated, hurl
profanities, peanuts, beer, seat cushions at the Sharks.
One OBESE FAN in particular:

FAN
You stink! Hey, Beamen! If you
could chuck a football like you
chuck vomit, you'd be an all-pro,
ha ha ha!

Willie ignores him, but when the Fan throws his beer at
him, it empties on Madman, who is rushing out last, his
IVs gone. Enraged, Madman roars and tries to go up into
the stands after the unlucky Fan, but is restrained by
teammates. AD LIBS...

THIRD QUARTER. MINNESOTA 31, MIAMI 21. 7:14 remaining.
Minnesota has increased its lead by one touchdown.

SIDELINE #18 A57

Tony paces anxiously.

FIELD #14 58

The Miami defense tries to stop a long gainer by the
Minnesota running back, propelling his 230 lbs. right at
Shark Lavay, who upends the running back, one on one...
Shark is the best open-field tackler on the Sharks,

but as he takes those few extra beats rising, adjusting
his shaken frame, congratulated by teammates, his expres-

sion reveals the wearying price he pays -- at 34, going
on 50 -- for this leadership role.

Powers now kneels next to the defensive end, Beast Man,
coming off the field onto the bench with an agonizing,
dislocated finger.

Using his bare white foot, the smallish Eastern European
Miami kicker drills a graceful 38-yard field goal through
the uprights.

FIELD #16 61

Everything moves fast in the big leagues. Too fast.
Willie again too quickly breaks from the pocket,
scrambling the offensive and defensive lines up and down
the field, tiring them... Unable to find his receiver, he
takes off running; makes it over the middle of the field
for a first down plus another five or ten yards before he
is pulped in two different directions.

perfect 10-yard interception over the middle into the
arms of a Minnesota linebacker. The stadium turns really
sour, booing Willie as he walks off.

for hours through the air.

Willie, playing with some real confidence, runs an option
pass right, and completes a 17-yarder to the second
receiver.

FIELD #21 74

This time Willie heads left, faking well off his right
shoulder to keep the DBs deep, then takes off on an
adventuresome run through the Americans. He's a natural-
born athlete, but the Minnesota defense exhorts a price
for making them look bad -- pounding him hard after a
13-yard gainer.

At the bottom of the pile, the linemen wrestle one another,
going for the eyes and nuts, anything for the edge (AD

Swack! He is blindsided by the tall, reptilian defensive
end, who hatchets him from high, then drives his helmet
into the ball, which pops out high and loose and crazy.
It is a spectacular fumble -- the kind of fumble all
running backs have nightmares about -- Washington
desperately dives back for it -- but everyone else is
diving too, including Willie.

A swift Minnesota safety makes the snag -- racing past
confused Miami players -- some 24 yards, into the end
zone. Touchdown.

BRANSON (V.O.)
Oh my God! Oh no!

TUG (V.0.)

Oh yes! Your worst nightmare as a

running back!

BRANSON (V.O.)

Washington was looking for that

first down. Big mistake!
Willie is on his knees, unbelieving... Washington drops
his head, the loneliest man in the world. A gash of
blood crawls down inside his helmet from his forehead.

INT. ROONEY'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT 97

Coach D'Amato enters to find Cap Rooney in bed, his lower
back and legs supported, a morphine drip in one arm and
an IV in the other, unnaturally white and swollen from
the hits -- doing his stoic best to abide the searing
pain in his back. Flowers fill the crevices of the room.

Cindy, his concerned and devoted wife, acknowledges Tony
with a head nod.

ROSE (V.0.)

(on TV, to guest)
... Frank, Frank, Frank, you gotta
wonder why D'Amato called that
play when everyone knows J-Man
likes to pick his spot when he
runs... and you're running the
same play twice in a row? Come
on! There's a reason this team
has lost four in a row. Forget
about the offensive line and Cap
Rooney. Forget about money-
grubbing greed-head Christina
Pagniacci who sold three of last
year's stars. And forget about
the defense -- there is none!
This team is just not in sync.
They remind me of my ‘ex.'
She had 21 different personalities.
Seven of them hated me...

(as his guest laughs)
No kiddin', I think D'Amato's play
books have consisted of the same
11 plays since 1971. It's gotta
be a shorter list than 'The
History of Jews in Sports,' but
lucky for him, the Sharks have a
couple of teeth left in their
head, otherwise these guys would
be bottom-feeding at 2-14 instead
of thrashin' at 7-6...

go short over the middle... More

happened to me like that before...

INT. TONY D'AMATO'S HOME - NIGHT 100

The letter "L" is written with a black marker next to the
Americans on the season schedule (Miami is now 7-6). There
are only three games left in the regular season: Chicago,
California and New York. Tony cradles a cordless phone
while drinking Scotch, as a COMPUTERIZED VOICE introduces
Jeanette's voice on the answer machine.

JEANETTE (V.O.)
Please leave your full name and a
message after the tone and we'll

TONY
(into his cordless)
Hi, Jeanette, it's Tony... I was

hoping you'd still be awake. What

tried to call earlier but things
got... never mind. Listen...

He walks into his bedroom, emptying his pockets on the

a boy and a girl; another of Tony with Cap Rooney and Art
Pagniacci winning the "Pantheon Cup."

TONY
«+. tell Tommy we gotta game in
L.A. In a couple of weeks. I'm

EXT. PRACTICE FIELD #1 - NEXT DAY

(NOTE: Potential one of three football practices -- a
brief montage set to music, that leads us to:)

EXT. CHRISTINA PAGNIACCI'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS ACTION - 101
DAY

Tony drives up to a beautiful mansion on one of
Miami's bays in an older, elegant car. As he talks into
an audio-video monitor, the gates roll open.

INT. CHRISTINA PAGNIACCI'S OFFICE/HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 102
ACTION - DAY

In a large cross-shadowed private office, Christina and
Johnny Polito listen to Ed Phillips on the phone --
noticing Tony's drive-up on the indoor monitor... The
walls reveal pictures of Christina with various high-
powered individuals in the city; an MBA from Stanford;
others that are competitive at tennis and golf, on
safari and skiing with her husband; shots of her as a
young girl with her dad. In these images of fishing,
riding, hunting, perhaps one senses that Christina was
raised as an only son by Art Pagniacci and forever
embodies the hardness of that fate.

ED PHILLIPS (0.S.)
(into phone)
Well, we think 100 million is
extortion too, Governor... Then
will you file a friend-of-the-
court brief on our behalf if we go
up against the League's transfer

fee?... Great!

CHRISTINA
«+. you're sure? No public bond
issues -- no extra tax assessments?

ED PHILLIPS

CHRISTINA

So let me get this straight: the
Governor of California's saying
there's nothing for the public to
vote on, right?

ED PHILLIPS
(pleased)
That's what he's saying. He's got
a way to finance a new stadium in
Hawthorne, with lottery and casino
money! As long as we partner with
this realty company he's pushing...

JOHNNY POLITO
Sure. He owns all that shit land
he wants to get rid of.

CHRISTINA
+. he gives us the full concession,
parking, signage, sponsorship money?

ED PHILLIPS
(nods )
--. and 100 percent from the
luxury boxes and club seats!

CHRISTINA
(amazed)
My God, L.A. is a dream! You
realize they're giving us the
world, Ed?!

ED PHILLIPS
(downplaying it)
Well, it's certainly good enough to
leverage the City of Miami into a
new stadium.

CHRISTINA
Oh, Ed! It's more than that...
(pause, seeing Tony's
car pull up)
I just don't trust Smalls backing
this stadium bond. Dad always
said he was a thief in a tuxedo...

always has. And he knows we've
got a big glitch anyway.

CHRISTINA
We don't really, Ed, we can...!

ED PHILLIPS
You keep underestimating the power
of the franchises, Christina.
They don't want us! They want an
expansion team in L.A. which they
can make a lot more money with!

JOHNNY POLITO
Bullshit! They want an established
team with a fan base. A new
stadium with a multiplex theater
shopping mall. We're in the
entertainment business, Ed. Think
football in the 21st Century.

ED PHILLIPS
Johnny, have you got some sleazy
little side deal I don't know
about yet?

JOHNNY POLITO
Ed, you're getting old.

ED PHILLIPS
«+. And you're getting greedy,
Johnny.

CHRISTINA

The Association will listen to
reason. L.A. is an entertainment
empire! It can easily handle two
teams. Here, what? The wrong fan
base. No Hispanic players, no
Hispanic fans...

(off silence)
Ed, if ever you owed Dad a favor,
make it this one! This team will
be born again in L.A.!

ED PHILLIPS
What about the Rosenthal bid?

for 800 million.

ED PHILLIPS

(disbelieving)
You're like your father that way,
darling -- a dreamer... My advice

to you is, sell the goddamn team.
You don't really want to own a
football team, Christina. You're

Tony looks hungover and bumps into something, as Christina
crosses into the giant-sized living room.

CHRISTINA
Come in... Morning, Tony.
TONY

TONY

I'll tell you this -- Julian

save us some dollars in the
bargain.

TONY
Pretty smart move, Christy. You
want me to bench my All-Pro back?
Any other suggestions?

A testy edge to the dialogue, as Christina freezes the
image of Julian fumbling. She shows him the sports
section of USA Today -- folded to a condemnation of

the team, specifically Tony. Although raised to treat
Tony like an "uncle" in a large Italian-American family,
the team comes first and foremost.

CHRISTINA
Sarcasm is not a solution. Four
in a row, Tony. They want your
head. Without Cap, it's gonna
take a miracle to make the
playoffs.

TONY
(re: the newspaper)

jerk, Christy. We're a solid
team, and we're gonna get to the
playoffs. This is not the time to

It's 'over'!? The hell it's over!
We been there before -- I can pull

this out. I always have. Worse
things than this have...

 

CHRISTINA
Dad used to say, 'No intensity, no
victory.' Where the hell is your

intensity, Tony!? We were always
in the playoffs. Four years ago
the only thing we worried about
was winning a third Pantheon Cop!
Now what? We're a second-tier
team, Tony, that's what!

(as he objects)
.-. No, admit it! You're not
being honest, we're the fifth,
sixth team in this league. We
just don't get the respect
anymore. For chrissake, Tony,
just four years ago we won the
Pantheon Cup! Do you remember!
We beat the pants off
Massachusetts! Dad would be

created...

Running game!? Okay -- you always
talk about a running game. But
who cares as long as you win!
People want to watch passes,
touchdowns, high scores! That's

lot of money to get Nick Crozier
here from Minnesota specifically
to modernize this offense. But
when I look down at the field I
don't see any new play calling, I
don't see him doing what he does
best. And frankly, what is most
disturbing, is I don't see you even
listening to his calls from the

Christina, not in the goddamn
boxes! You knew that when you had
candy stuck in your braces.

right now? Probably a first anda
third draft choice. He's still
got an arm, and people respect
him. We know he's finished but if
we're smart, we can...

TONY

No, I don't know that, Christy, I
don't! Cap's got two, maybe three
great years left in him. This is
football. Today guys in their 40s
are playing...

(a silence)
Do I gotta remind you he helped
build this franchise, which you
benefitted from? That he's a hero
to the working people of Florida.
And one of the greatest pressure
players of all time. You just
don't cut a man like Cap Rooney!

 

 

CHRISTINA
Excuse me -- Cap and Shark were
great, but memories don't pass and
tackle like they used to...

 

TONY
Shark changed linebacking forever!
He made a quantum leap in the
game!...

CHRISTINA

both of them with dignity! With
class! We'll give ‘em positions
in the front office, retire their

million-dollar-a-year, 39-year-
old quarterback no matter how big
he was.

(pointing to a stack

less money than 90 percent of the
other teams. The economics simply
don't make any sense!

then! You had intensity, Tony!
But today he'd cut your ass!

The DBs have him beat by a yard or so. But Willie leaps
into the air at the 2-yard line to avoid the diving
tacklers. Then, finding himself having to go yet higher,
he flips in mid-air, taking himself over their heads,
pads and all, into a somersault, landing scot-free in the
end zone. TD! Amazing!

Willie trots off the field, looking for D'Amato, about 15
or 20 yards away, with daring in eyes that say, "You want
to win or not? Go fuck yourself!"... Cap, next to Tony,
reads the situation, but the rest of the team, standing
and milling, is simply awed by this new discovery.

TUG (V.0.)
If I'm Tony D'Amato right now I'm
looking to the football gods
saying, 'What did I ever do to
deserve this?'

BRANSON (V.O.)
You bet! Tony must've been good
to a lot of widows and orphans
over the years. A back-up

EXT. MANSION (MIAMI) - BOAT DOCK - NIGHT

The stars are out tonight. Establishment Miami meets
football jocks meets business supporters meets politicos,
meets sex and alcohol. It's also a charity event,
designed by the Sharks' P.R. Department to deliver a
Children's Needy Fund some million dollars a year, most
of which is being raised tonight -- with, naturally, the
colorful Mayor Tyrone Smalls in attendance.

Julian Washington ROARS up to the dock in a dramatic
CIGARETTE BOAT -- product logos for his sponsors all over
it. Four gorgeous girls cling to him. Flashbulbs
explode, the paparazzi eating this up as much as Julian.

EXT. MANSION - PODIUM - CONTINUOUS ACTION 124

A banner reading: CHILDREN'S FUND OF MIAMI. Flashbulbs

TYRONE SMALLS, a boisterous Afro-American in his 60s.

CHRISTINA

Pagniacci Foundation,

I'm glad to present D.A.R.E. with

Much applause.

MAYOR SMALLS

(dramatic)
The city of Miami would like to
thank Christina Pagniacci, you are
a great Miamian! You have done as

and crime from our city streets...

wonderful role models for our
inner-city youth to look up to.
I'm all for it, honey, now let's

get down and party!!

Raucous laughter. People have long come to accept the
Mayor's idiosyncracies. Smalls greets Christina's
mother, a blitzed Margaret, on the podium, escorted by Ed
Phillips. Also there is Andy, Christina's yawning, tired
husband.

Observing this in the crowd are Willie and Vanessa, who
feels herself out of place and underdressed for this
affair. She excuses herself to the ladies' room... as
Willie walks over to Sanderson and Julian.

can't help but notice Willie openly gazing at women of
beauty, with finer clothes and jewels.

Trish's hot, flushed face says it all. She adjusts her
panties under the table, allowing better access for
Shark's hand. The others listen intently to Shark.

ELDERLY MAN
(impeccable accent)
What was your best hit, Mister
Lavay?

SHARK

pouring rain, I'm deep...

TRISH

Mandrake protests. Shark has removed his hand, but
notices Madman nearby, coming on strongly to one of the
local society dames who impresses him with her face jobs
and jewelry. His pregnant, pathetic mouse wife sits
alone in a corner, wanting to cry.

SHARK

relaying the signals to Willie on the field.

The system's fucked! I mean games

of his own)
Coach, you're gonna have a stroke.

MONROE

A cry of grief from the crowd stops him. Monroe spins to
the field to see a mad brawl of players for a Shark
fumble -- a Crusaders player comes up with the ball!

And worse! At the line of scrimmage, Leslie McKenna, the
right guard, is down.

What is it with you, Coach?!

TONY
Goddamn it, Sammy, his knee was
down! He was down by a mile.
Both knees were down. Give me a

was no fumble!

 

REFEREE #3
To be honest, Tony -- I didn't
really see it.

TONY

To be honest, Sammy, neither did
I.

Referee #3 shakes his head and runs back to the field as
Mandrake hurries over to Tony.

McKenna's got a distended knee,
torn everything, bloody nightmare

Two L.A. corners blanket Sanderson -- but Julian is open,
waiting in the flat.

WASHINGTON
Willie!!
Willie ignores him, his eyes downfield -- a Crusaders'
lineman is almost on him when Madman slams him aside at
the last moment... Willie takes the shot -- it's a dead

perfect pass, threading the microscopic gap between two
Crusaders' defenders. Sanderson spins in midair so that
the nose of the ball crosses the goal line just as he is
slammed backwards by the backs -- too late -- the Ref's
arms shoot up -- touchdown!

Willie races down the field and grabs Sanderson, both of
them breaking into a funky dance.

several others step in to separate Willie.

Willie, pursued by linemen and almost off balance, throws
an incredible long bomb, hitting his third receiver; the
ball travels almost 60 yards in the air. The receiver
runs it in for a touchdown!

WILLIE
You mean you're influenced by what

«+. Reebok got this whole ad
campaign ready to go the
minute I hit 2,000 yards. But
it's ABC, man, I don't get the
ball -- I don't get my stats -- I
don't get my money -- and I like
gettin' my money.

CROZIER
This team isn't about your damn
stats!

TONY

For that matter, you're lucky
we're not keeping track of your
blocking 'stats,' J...

WASHINGTON
What's that mean?

TONY
What's that mean? It means y'ever
try blocking for a change, J?
It's not that bad an idea...

WASHINGTON
I'm sick of hearing that shit!
I'm tryin', but blocking's for
those Clydesdale horses, man. You
don't use a thoroughbred to block.
You run his ass.

TONY
That's a winning attitude, kid.

WASHINGTON
How much you payin' that 300-pound
blocker, man? Let him block,
‘cause he sure can't run.

 

CAP

(to Tony)
... Look, J-man's got a point --
Beamen's not doing his homework.
He isn't studying the playbook, he
doesn't come in to look at any
films, he doesn't even know the
damn names of the defensive
players he's facing. He doesn't
give a geewhiz about anything or
anybody! He just wants to make

TONY
What? What do you mean he's
changing the plays?

WASHINGTON
I said he's changing the plays --
in the huddle. The plays you
designed that I loved. Just does
what he likes.

TONY
In the huddle?

WASHINGTON
I'm not talking audibles, Coach.
Today he did it all day long.
Kid's dissing this play, that
play, saying, 'I gotta better
play.'

Hey, guys, we won. What's the

when you came out of that
concussion?

SHARK

dumb-ass question! Next?

Which cracks up the reporters.

ROSE
So what were you telling Beamen on
the sideline, Coach?

TONY

I was telling him how much I loved
him.
They laugh.
ROSE

("friendly" smile)
Follow-up question. You think
your boys could've won the game
without him, Coach?

TONY
Why is it every time you ask me a
question, Jack, it sounds like,
"so, did you beat your wife?' You
goddamn know I don't have a wife,
Jack, and you know I don't play

The question gives Willie pause. He fields it

Don't play the race card with me,

placism, but the black man still
gotta know his place, right, Coach?

TONY
What are you saying? You don't
trust anybody ‘cause of what
happened to you in college? You
knew the rules, Willie, you broke
‘em.

WILLIE
Broke 'em?! How'd I break ‘em?

TONY
You broke ‘em. That's how you
broke, ‘em.

WILLIE
Man, I lost a million-dollar
signing bonus ‘cause a booster
gave me a three-hundred-dollar
suit to go to his kid's wedding.
I didn't even know the guy.
Hell, everybody was getting

I dropped six rounds in the draft
‘cause of that. And the coaches
rapping me ‘troublemaker,’ ‘arrogant, '
‘won't play ball,' all that corporate
shit they hit the brothers with
when they won't kiss the money.
Shit, I coulda made millions
of dollars if I'd kissed that big
ass Julian's kissing all the time.
You talk about 'sacrifice'? I
sacrificed about ten million dollars
is what I sacrificed, ‘cause of
those dumb rednecks like your
coach friend at San Diego who
makes me corner back ‘cause I got
fast feet! It was him separated
my shoulder, fucked up my throwin'
arm tackling some 250-pound
bullmother. I was a great football
player but nobody gave me the time
of day or the season I needed
to heal that shoulder. They
traded me right outta there!

 

TONY
Blame anybody but yourself,
Willie! yY'see, that's what a
leader is about, the times he's
gotta sacrifice because he has to
lead by example, not by fear or...

WILLIE
(challenged)

Fear?! Who you talking to?! I
hung in there when nobody gave a
shit about me. I rode the bench
for five fucking years! And now I
get my one lousy shot, I'm 26
years old -- half my football life
is over -- and now you tell me
‘You go on back to the bench, son.
‘Cause you gotta sacrifice for
the greater glory of Cap Rooney.’
Well, fuck you, Coach! I'm not
buying that brand, ‘cause you're
some scared old man who won't let
me play my way ‘cause I might just
win! And then what the fuck was
your life all about?!

Willie drives his Suburban right up onto the front lawn,

Willie, you are indefatigable!

Madman, on his cell phone, is heated as he watches the
TV, amid an atmosphere of CRYING BABIES, BARKING
PIT BULLS, and a pregnant, miserable wife.

EXT. SHARK STADIUM - NIGHT (RAIN) 187

(Game 4. New York Emperors at Miami Sharks.)

FIELD #1

Willie goes smashing into the mud, taking the hit on his
throwing shoulder. A painful sack, he drags himself up...
Dazed, Willie goes after the linebacker who nailed him...
The 49er players sprint over to protect their teammate,
but the Shark team does nothing to help their QB.

TUG (V.O.)
Welcome back to the Monsoon Bowl,
folks! The Emperors have been
eating Shark patties all night
long. Smashmouth football -- this
is what it's all about!

On the way to the huddle, over the DRIVING sound of RAIN.

WILLIE
Can I get some fuckin' protection
here! If you're not going to
block -- could you at least stay
the fuck out of my way?!

Madman goes for him, Sanderson and the others holding him
back.

Coach D'Amato glares at the field, the rain pouring over
his face.

TONY

Get_'em to stand up and block,

goddamnit, Hank! What's going
on?!

TIME CUT TO:

FIELD #2 189

As the Emperor offense sets up, Shark urgently calls for
a defensive realignment -- Miami players hustle for new
positions -- the veteran Emperor QB sees this and quickly
barks out an audible --

A quick handoff -- the Emperor running back shoots
through a hole in the confused Miami defense -- Shark
tries to make the diving tackle but his knee gives and
he goes facedown in the mud, as the running back
splashes right past him for 25 yards. Touchdown!

TUG (V.O.)

What is with the Miami D of late?
They are going belly up, fins
flapping. Glug-glug-glug!

BRANSON (V.O.)
Shark Lavay just can't find the
old magic down there.

The running back turns back to the downed Shark and his
D, and points his fingers like a gun -- Bang! Bang!
Bang! The trainer and doctors run out to Shark,
grabbing his knee in fierce pain.

Willie, reading a signal from Cherubini on the
sideline, takes the team on with a dead stare.

WILLIE
Y'all want to make it tough okay,
I can take it, m'fucker! ‘Cause I

know come contract time there
gonna be some big changes round
here -- and, baby, it's either

FIELD #3 192

WILLIE
(yelling over the RAIN)
Set! Black 671, Black 671! Hut!

Willie splashes back through the mud to pass -- an
Emperor defensive end slips through full speed -- Willie
is blindsided, his helmet goes flying off, he crashes to
the turf, his face slammed once more into the mud.

SIDELINE #2 193
D'Amato is wholly demoralized, can't look... Neither can

Cap Rooney, now in uniform, recognizing something he'd

rather not. Or something he'd perhaps forgotten -- the
sheer, frightening violence and impossibility of the QB
position.

CAP
They won't play for him, Tony.

Tony looks at him, frustrated.

Blood seeps down Willie's face from a scalp contusion as
he pulls himself slowly to his feet.

BRANSON (V.O.)
... And there goes home field
advantage for the Sharks!
Although their season ends on a
low note, there is still life
after death. Two weeks from now,
look for the underdog Sharks in
the playoffs in 'Toughtown U.S.A.'

INT. LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT 196

The locker room is silent and depressed as players
undress and shower.

BATHROOM/SHOWER #1
Willie, dazed and steaming with anger, crosses Shark.

SHARK
You lead. But did anyone follow,
nigga?

Willie ignores him, but not Julian on his other side,
when:

WASHINGTON
Whatsa matter, boy -- forgot your
‘invisible juice'?

Willie explodes, takes a wild swing at the big man.
They struggle. They slip... players pull them apart,
Willie bleeding.

«+. Thirty years in football, I

He stalks out.

EXT. PRACTICE FIELD #1 (3 OF 3) - DAY 197

Unnaturally bright lights are on Willie and Cap Rooney in
pads, side-by-side. They wear TV smiles, surrounded by a
gang of children in Shark jerseys. Willie's cheek is
stitched.

CAP
-+. So please give generously to
your Child Fund of America.

WILLIE
.-. And let's make every kid feel
like a superstar!

CAP
Because giving -- like football --
is a team sport. Thank you.

They smile. And smile. Finally:

VOICE (0.S.)
That's a wrap, thanks, guys.

Rooney and Willie split in different directions... we
PULL BACK to reveal a small TV crew shooting a public
service commercial. Christina talks with the Sharks' PR
director and a TV producer.

Julian Washington watches the shoot from the bleachers,
brooding, upstaged by Beamen.

The children from the commercial follow Willie for
autographs. Willie's agent notes this to Christina
as they leave.

Rooney crosses to Cindy.

CINDY
You should've fought for that
superstar line.

CAP
No -- 'giving' -- ‘team sport’ --
those are the lines.

CINDY

around Willie)
Meanwhile... You used to do this
spot alone.

CAP

Okay... you finished?

Walks away.

In the bleachers with the rest of the media, Jack Rose
observes with his two-man TV crew.

Julian studies the kids, who seem to adore Willie. An
OLDER KID, 11 years old, intersects.

KID #1

Hey, J-man! Is it true you making
10 million a year?

(as J-man smiles,

nods )
«+. That true then ‘bout you not
blocking no more? It's part of
your contract? That's what my Dad
says. He says you don't have to
catch no passes over the middle
either ‘cause you don't want to get

ACTION - DAY

Tony sits with Dr. Powers, Monroe and Shark Lavay -- his
MRI's spread on Tony's desk, the mood glum.

TONY
--. So what are the odds?

POWERS

There's no telling. It's an
‘odontoid fracture’...

(off their looks)
Basically, he broke his neck and
it never healed right. Coming
after the 20 to 30 concussions he's
had over 14 years, you can't predict
this type of thing, but I can say
this: the wrong hit could result
in paralysis, Parkinson's... even
sudden death.

SHARK

Hey, what else is new...?
POWERS

In my opinion, he shouldn't be

out there...

(pointed at Shark)
You could be braindead, your
speech slurred or you could have
weird personality changes for the
rest of your life... you
understand what I'm telling you,
Luther?

SHARK

(offset by his

sanctimony)
Luther do, but 'Shark' don't, Doc!
I been playing with fire since you
was shitting in your diapers, and
right now I need one sack and
three more tackles and I get my
bonus. Then we'll talk, okay,
motherfucker!

his feelings close.

TONY

SHARK

TONY
(pause)
‘Course I do, Shark, but no, not at
this price... no.

SHARK

(pleading to play)
Look, you goddamn know well as me
she gonna cut my ass anyhow in the
off-season! And no one's gonna
pick me up for any kinda money.
I'll be back here begging to
play for field wages, Coach...

Tony doesn't deny it, silent.

SHARK
I gave you 13 years of my best,
Coach, you know you owe me...
For a million bucks, shit! I'll
shake like a coconut tree the
rest of my life if I got to...
just lemme play... please?

TONY
(pause)
You'll have to sign a waiver, Shark.

SHARK

These players are freaks of nature

Jack Rose with his crew, and several other reporters.

The snap -- the red-shirted D comes with a blitz. Rooney
paralyzes, showing a moment of pure terror in his eyes as
“Beast Man," the DB, pulls up short; the WHISTLE SHRIEKS.

BEAST MAN

Willie makes his way through layers of steam. There is
only one other player in the bath -- Shark Lavay. Willie

at Willie, who won't look at him.

SHARK
«++. You know punks come and go in
this league. They get picked up
right out of the ‘hood ‘cause they
can run or fight, ‘cause they're
fast and strong and big. And
suddenly they got all the money

and hit -- but what else?...
Suddenly there's no more money, no
more women, no more applause... No
more 'Dream.'

Shark knows it's ending for him.

SHARK

(quietly)
This is what I'm saying to you,
Willie: when a man looks back on
his life, he should be proud of

in pads and cleats. Not just
memories of when he was... great.
That he gotta learn in here...

Cap Rooney cooks hot dogs on the outdoor barbecue of his
massive suburban home. The lawn is far removed, as most
of the outdoor activity takes place on concrete. The
three Rooney kids (two boys, one girl) are tricycling,
screaming, running through doll houses -- as a busy
Cindy Rooney surveys it from an upstairs balcony on

the cell phone.

life. Everything. It's not fun

Tony, the first time I got hit in
the pros I thought my heart was

I just can't do that. It's my

Tony's disgusted and moved at the same time; relents and
puts a comforting hand on Cap's shoulder; his
quarterback's breaking down right in front of his

eyes -- he's never seen him like this. But Tony,

ever the coach of men, won't allow Cap -- or

himself -- to quit.

Four sexy women in short killer skirts sway like

Willie entertains his agent, Mercer, at an outdoor club
overlooking the beach. Two beautiful models accompany
them. Attractive people stroll by. Various ETHNIC
MUSIC PLAYS, a warm, highly-artificial setting that
Willie senses, as he listens absently to the dialogue at
the table, a vocabulary reduced to words of expansion,
contracts, and greed. On the table are covers of

Sports Illustrated and ESPN sports featuring Willie.

MERCER

They want you!... and we'll make

‘em swallow the beer

your moment? -- You can forget
about this team -- they gonna lose

anyhow -- but you get that one
shining moment when they notice
you, ‘money, when they really see
you -- then you are a 'star' in
this culture, baby, and you are
looking at five million serious
dollars next year someplace,
anyplace! Maybe L.A. I'm
talking intensely to L.A. Shit,

at two million for the year... but

That's why Willie works for me.
He sells tickets. And that's why
he's starting Sunday.

TONY
You know, I'm really sick and tired
of you calling me an old asshole!
Your father was no genius. He acted
like he was. And he took a lot of
credit for things he didn't do.
But let me tell you something, he
at least respected me and he
respected the concept of the coach
coaching and the owner owning. I
can't even imagine what he'd think
of you right now with this...

Ashamed!

CHRISTINA
Why the hell do you think he left
me in charge, you bullheaded

didn't have the guts to do it

without him when he was gone
alright! He told me so himself.

We can't let that happen. We owe

MARGARET

You never understood Art, Tony...
He wanted a son more than anything
in the world...

When you truly contemplate what
Christina is, it really is a
tragedy. Believe me, she will
fire you and sell the soul of the
team -- and everything her father
stood for will die... and that is
as it should be... and neither you

herself, will ever understand her

Her intensity is unnerving.

He picks out Mandy's lipsticked telephone number on a
piece of paper and, after a pause, tears it up.

ROSE (V.0.)
«+. To tell you the truth -- this
is me speaking from the heart now
-- I feel a little sorry for Coach
D'Amato. I always hoped he'd
leave this game with a little
dignity left.

Rose continues to rattle on in the b.g., but Tony ignores
the babble of our time, removing from the drawer a small
wooden box and a framed picture of a younger Tony with
Jeanette, Timmy, and Melinda.

He sets the box aside and picks up the picture. It is
clear now that he is crying. He looks at it for a long
and difficult moment, then sets the picture down and
opens the box -- in it are two glimmering Pantheon Cup
rings.

IMAGES slowly move. Ghosts. Men who once played the
game, heroic and shimmering, a thing of glory... We don't
know who these ghosts are, but we sense what they
represent. Some in old leather helmets, the '30s, ‘40s,
‘50s, each era unfolds its changes... le plus ca change,
le plus ca reste le meme... the diving catches, the
magnificent tackles and blocks, the astounding runs and
passes become really the same through time -- accompanied

six point Shark underdogs. Willie
‘Steamin' Beamen, the sensational
third-string miracle-mile
quarterback who's held the sinking
Sharks together these last four
weeks, is not starting and is said
to be feuding with his beleaguered
Coach, Tony D'Amato -- who is being
investigated by the League for
having 'hit' local reporter Jack
Rose at practice earlier this
week... Meanwhile, immortal but
vulnerable Cap Rooney -- only six
weeks off a microdiskectomy on his
lower back -- is definitely
starting for the Sharks against
the toughest pass-rush in the
league. Watch for the sparks that
are gonna fly! We'll be right back!

Another player (OTIS), finishes praying, crosses himself,

The door is closed. As the huge CROWD upstairs makes its
presence known, STOMPING and ROARING, the ECHOES surging
through the tunnels and pipes of the inner stadium, Dr.
Powers, in temporary charge, inserts a large 18-gauge
needle of cortisone directly into the swollen, scarred
knee of Shark, who winces in great pain. Powers drains a
straw-colored liquid into a Dixie cup.

SHARK

God, I hate Texas!

HORNY
(poking his head in)
Whoa! What the fuck they doing to

you, man!

SHARK
M'fucker, they're taking a cyst
outta my ovaries!! Now get the

Powers now shines a beam of light into Shark's eyes,
moving his finger back and forth in front of his eyes.

POWERS
How's that headache?
SHARK
It was okay till you started doing
that shit...
POWERS
What about your balance?
SHARK
You talkin' my check balance?
Look p-h-a-t, baby -- 'phat.'

Powers retracts the needle.

wrong choice a middle-aged old man

of rookie mistakes. I pissed away
all my money, chased off everyone

that loved me... lately I can't
even stand the face I see in the
mirror.

This team has never heard their Coach take it to such a
personal level.

TONY
«+. As we get older, some things
are taken away... well, that's

part of life, but you only learn
that when you lose something.

You find out that life is this game
of inches! So's football.

Because the margin for error in
either game, football or life, is
so small... so small, guys. One
half-step too late or too early
and you don't quite make it. One
half-second too slow or too fast
and you don't quite catch it
‘cause it's half a fingertip away.
The inches we need are everywhere
around us, they're in every break
of the game, every minute, every
second. Mandrake forgot that. He
was grabbing for miles when he
only needed inches. And on this
team there are no shortcuts.

There are no more Doctor
Mandrakes. On this team we fight
for that inch! We tear ourselves
and everyone else around us to
pieces for that inch! We claw
with our fingernails for that inch
‘cause when you add up all those
inches, that is what makes the
fucking difference between winning

and losing -- between living and
dying... In any fight I can tell

you this, it's the guy who's
willing to die who's going to win
that inch.

The six inches in front of your
face. I can't make you do it.
You have to look around -- look at
the guy next to you -- look into
his eyes -- and I think you'll see
a guy you know will go that inch
with you. You'll see a guy who'll
sacrifice himself for this team
because when it comes down to it,
he knows you would do the same for
him! That's a team, gentlemen!...
And either we will heal now as a
team -- or we will die as
individuals...

Cap fades back -- a Dallas defender breaks through the
line -- Cap scrambles out of the pocket -- no one can get
open -- he tucks the ball and decisively charges the goal
line.

The "old man" will not be denied in a race to the goal
line. A Dallas defender zeroes in on him. Rather than
slide, Rooney hurls himself into the air, inspired
possibly by the younger Willie and collides head-first
with a Dallas defender -- a thunderclap of sound.

The ball, tight in Rooney's grasp, is planted firmly
beyond the goal line -- touchdown!
SIDELINE #4 A237

The Sharks taste the old glory!

FIELD #8 238

Rooney pulls himself slowly to his feet, accepting the
congratulations of his teammates, inwardly numb, outwardly
ecstatic.

FIELD #9 241
Cap fades back, a fake screen to Julian which deceives
Dallas, then he flings it far downfield -- headed for

Sandman...

Rooney thinks it's a lock... But the pass, 45 yards in

the air, is overthrown by inches! -- Sanderson, perhaps a
half step late on his own, stretches but cannot grasp it
-- missing by an inch -- the ball implodes, incomplete,

as the Miami fans moan and the Dallas fans roar.

As Cap walks to the sideline, crossing his punting unit,
an eerie feeling invades a mind already fragile in
confidence.

The full blitz at the Miami 35 -- two Dallas speedsters
come from either side -- Rooney fakes a handoff to Julian
and turns upfield -- but both Dallas defenders slam into
him, a devastating double hit -- his body crumples into
the grass.

The ball sails from his hands -- a Dallas lineman

snatching it up on the bounce and sprinting to the Miami

back. Shark waits, poised to fill the hole. The back
powers forward, no running lanes -- he bounces to the

outside, sees daylight, speeds for it...

Shark runs desperately to the same hole on his bum and
swollen knee. The runner is almost to the first down

marker -- inches! -- He dives for it!
Shark dives at the exact same time -- an all-out lunge of
sheer faith to stop the first down -- at any cost!

as I can to you: We -- the Sharks
-- have no intention of leaving

love our Shark Stadium -- and we
will continue to remodel it, at
whatever cost, to make it a home
away from home for our fans!

therefore to stick it out here in
