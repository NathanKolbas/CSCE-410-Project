PROLOGUE

This film is based on events that occurred
in El Salvador in 1980-82. For narrative purposes
the time frame of these events has been condensed
and some events have been combined without --
the filmnakers believe -- violating the spirit
of that time. Living characters have been
fictionalized.

"With lies they tried
to make us lie.

As if they did not know
that the mouth was
made to say -

the eye to see.”

Salvadoran Peasant

INTERIOR SAN FRANCISCO TENEMENT = TENDERLOIN = DAWN 2.

 

Richard Boyle flicks open a battered eye, the landlord is
knocking on the door. CREDITS roll.

The baby starts crying. Bis tired, pretty Italian wife,
CLAUDIA, bottle-feeding the baby to keep it quiet, makes
her way to the door...

Boyle sits up. It looks like another Major Bad Day is
in the works. A battered body and face, # man who has
seen far better days, and obviously has hit the bottle
one too many times, his body is something that would
make Jack LaLanne throw up, mid-forties, he looks like
the ten wars he's been in -- a survivor of countless
accidents and broken dreams, the potato famines of a
wiry Trish soul.

In background, the TENDERLOIN LANDLORD is arguing with
Claudia, the argument moving across the flat to Boyle,
putting on his clothes, one eye flicked to the morning
news on the broken-down black and white portable.

NEWSMAN
In the wake of the Nicaraguan revolution,
chaos has descended on tiny El Salvador...
Today two more Catholic priests were
found hacked to death in a ditch outside
the Capital. S0 far in two months more
than 1000 people have “disapoeared,” many
of them found murdered in ditches and
dumping grounds along roads outside the
Capital and in the provinces...Government
spokesmen attribute the murders to left-
wing Marxist terrorists, while left-wing
spokesmen point to the right-wing “death-
squads." 0.5. Government spokesmen will
only identify these assailants as .
“subversives" of both the right and left...
in other news, the upcoming presidential
election polls show Ronald Reagan leading...

An Claudia handing him the crying baby as the argument continues.
Boyle familiar with the child, rocks it, feeds it.

Claudia throws the Landlord's eviction papers on the floor,
cursing in Italian. "Fuck you, you bloodsucker, you black
shiti") The LANDLORD, who is black and particularly
wicious-looking, picks it back up, waves it at Boyle. (has a
fistful of cash - just collected) x
LANDLORD
No bucks no Buck Rogers Boyle. You

BOYLE
Hev man. come on, aive me a break. x

As he fumbles with the hot plate and the instant coffee. .
Outside on the fire escape are diapers and a flashing neon
sign. His life is obviously a mess, papers and books
everywhere, dirty clothes, Nikon camera, cyanide pills,
cortison, war trophies, a VC flag, joints, cheap typewriter...

The Landlord exits, muttering.

Gabriella at the Police Headquarters, in now barricaded on

Boyle looking up into the sky with a sense of dread as he

They're coming. Reapers of his destruction.

Cassady resets his telephoto lens. Boyle tries to advance
his camera but the advance lever now breaks off -- rendering
his camera useless. He throws the lever away and kicks
himself, frustrated, a symbol of his wasted life, missing
the greatest shots of his lifetime.

The four black dots are getting closer, fighters -- pilatos --
in a tight formation, on a low strafing run.

As the rebels scatter, Cassady edges up for the shot of the
Plane coming right up main street, laying out death on the
Gime. Boyle yelling for his to get down but lost in the

The rebels are dead or dying, the INFANTRYMEN swarming up

An OLDER GUY, leathery face, squinty eyes, mutters to his OLD tary.

OLDER GUY
He's on drugs.

Boyle being led off the bus -- across to @ 2nd Squad Car just
arriving.

A YUPPIE COUPLE, 30's, watches a1] this, the wife visibly upset,
her husband reassuring her.

YUPPIE BUSBAND
oo-but honey somebody's got to keep
these people out or we'll be overrun
(to Driver)
Driver, we're running late as it is.
Can we get going now?

The bus doors svish closed with a hiss of air.
EXT. HIGHWAY = DAY 135.

Boyle pushed into a Squad Car. Sunglasses on the Radio.
General cop bullshit -- "One WMA, Boyle, Richard David, 2/26/42..."

As Richard twists around, looking at the other squad car.

One last glimpse of Maria, handcuffed, and the Kids looking
at him through the backseat window. They’re all crying,
Duglas pounding on the glass. Siren whining, Erik Estrada
flashing by, their squad car now goes. Back to the South.
Gone forever.

As Richard heads north. A stunned look, never so lost or alone --
tears in his eyes.

THE END
