EXT/INT. JEEP - WEST COAST OF JUTLAND - AFTERNOON
May 1945. World War 2 is over.

CU A Danish soldier, Carl (41)(military rank: Sergeant) is
driving along in a jeep. He turns into a gravel road.
After a while he comes to the dunes overlooking the beach.
Carl parks the jeep and steps out. He walks over the
dunes. On his back is a big backpack from which little
black flags are sticking out. Carl stops on top of one
of the dunes and looks across the beach. Clearly, this is
a post-war landscape. As far the eye can see the beach

is covered with lines of barbwire and signs saying.
‘DANGER! MINES.'

Carl pushes some sand off with his foot. (He looks at a
mine map) A wooden plank (Pansermine) appears beneath the
sand. Carl puts his backpack down and digs further up
ahead. Another plank appears. Carl puts his backpack
back on and walks along the planks down towards the sea.
He treads carefully, it is obvious that the entire beach
is littered with mines. You can even see some of them
poke up through the sand.

Carl goes all the way to the water before he stops. He
looks down the beach. He pulls a flag out of his backpack
and sticks it into the sand. Then we walks along the
water.

INT. ARMY TRUCK - AFTERNOON

CU of young German soldier on the back of an army truck.
This is Sebastian(16).

Besides Sebastian are 11 other German boys.

We see their faces one by one. Manfred(16), Werner(17),
Ernst(17), Helmut(19), Ludvig(16), Wilhelm(15) and so on.
12 boys in all. They are just teenagers, nevertheless
their youngish faces have a worn-out look to them. Like
they have borrowed them from much older, and more
experienced men. Hard and weary. The boys all look like
they have been starving, some more than others. They are
in various types of uniform. All of which are worn and
torn.

Two of the boys (Werner and Ernst) are like two peas ina
pod. They are obviously twins. Hidden from the view of
the others, they are holding hands.

Sebastian peers out through the a gap in tarpaulin cloth
that covers the back of the truck. He squints as the
setting sun gets in his eyes. The truck is driving along
a straight road through a forest near the Danish North
Sea coastline.
EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - LATE AFTERNOON

Carl is driving his jeep along. He drives past long lines
of German prisoners of war walking south along the road,
heading back down towards Germany.

Further ahead there is a scuffle between some Danes and
the German POV's. Carl pulls up to them. Honks the horn.
He stops and gets out.

Carl drags the Danes away. The Germans are about to
continue walking. Carl turns towards them.

CARL (in German)
You stay here. Understood?

The Germans wait.

Carl goes over and talks to the Danes. (From afar) We
can't hear what they are saying. The Danes point over at
the Germans.

Carl turns around and goes over to the Germans. He smiles
at them. He stands there for a bit. He offers one of
them a cigarette. The German takes one and smiles back.
Carl takes out a lighter.

Long beat.

Carl headbutts the German. He goes down. Carl looks at
the other Germans. They make no move to interfere. They
look scared.

Nobody speaks.

The German who was knocked down by Carl gets back up.
They start walking.

EXT. ARMY BARRACKS S@NDERBORG AREA - LATE AFTERNOON

 

The truck with Sebastian and the boys drives through a
gate. It stops on a large open square. We see several
trucks pull up next to it. Pebbles crunch under the heavy
truck tires.

German prisoners of war in all ages spill out from the
trucks and settle in the square. A few Danish armed
soldiers are there to receive them.

EXT. ARMY BARRACKS S@NDERBORG AREA - LATE AFTERNOON

 

About 70 German prisoners of war of various ages are lined
up outside of the square outside the main building. Quite
a few of them are teenagers. They look wretched in their
worn-out torn uniforms.
3.

A young Danish officer, Ebbe(29) (rank: Lieutenant) comes
out of the main building. Ebbe walks briskly and stops
in front of the Germans.

Ebbe smiles and addresses the POW's in German.

EBBE
My name is Lieutenant Ebbe Jensen
from the Danish Pioneer Corps.
(Minenkommando
Danemark)

EBBE (CONT'D)
To those of you who are still
unaware of what you are doing
here: You have been brought here
to Denmark to clean up after the
war.

EBBE (CONT'D)
Denmark is neither your friend,
nor your enemy. Having said that,
do not expect the Danes to welcome
you with open arms. Nobody wants
you Germans here. For us you
serve one purpose only: To clear
the Danish west coast of German
land mines that you put there in
the first place.

EBBE (CONT'D)
I know that most of you have never
done any minesweeping or de-mining.
That is why we have brought you
here, before you are to de-mine
the beaches. We will teach you
as much as we can in the little
time we have. In other words. We
are here to help.

Beat.

EBBE (in German) (CONT'D)
Welcome to Denmark!

INT. SLEEPING QUARTERS/ BARRACKS - EVENING

Sebastian and the other boys walk in a line down a long
hallway. They are shown into the sleeping quarters. A
small room. Filled with bunk beds without mattresses.

Sebastian looks around. It seems most of the beds are
occupied.

Sebastian spots an empty bed, next to the window. He
sits down on the bed.

One of the older boys, Helmut(19), comes over. He looks
at Sebastian.
He stands there for a long time before he speaks.

HELMUT
Move. That's my bed.

Sebastian looks at the boy. Clearly, this is not his
bed. Sebastian thinks about standing his ground. Decides
against it. He gets up.

SEBASTIAN
Of course.

Sebastian finds a spot on the floor, where he sits down.
He looks around the room. He pulls his blanket around
him.

There is not enough beds for everyone and several others
have also had to settle for the floor.

Sebastian lies down. Looks around at the others before
he shuts his eyes.

INT. INTERIM CLASSROOM - MORNING

Sebastian and most of the boys he came with in the truck
are standing to attention in a small classroom. The young
commanding officer Ebbe comes in. He is flanked by two
Danish soldiers. He stands in front of the boys. On a
table are several land mines.

Ebbe looks around the room. He pulls down a map of
Denmark.

EBBE
Good morning!

EVERYONE
Good morning, lieutenant!

Ebbe smiles. Ebbe outlines the western coast of Denmark
on the map with his cane.

EBBE
There are currently 2.2 million
land mines spread out along the
Danish west coast.

He looks at the boys.

EBBE (CONT'D)
This is more than in all the other
European countries together ...
Someone must have thought that
the invasion from the west would
take place right here..

Ebbe points again.
EBBE (CONT'D)
+-On the Danish coastline to the
North Sea. What a shame for him.
And what a shame for you lot too!

Beat.

EBBE (CONT'D)
My only purpose here is to teach
you lot how to find and disarm
these mines. Nothing else. This
is what I do. This is what I am
good at. In other words, I don't
need to know your names, your
background. I don't need to get
to know you. You have each other
for that. I am simply not
interested.

Nobody says anything.

EBBE (CONT'D)
Understood?

EVERYONE
Yes, lieutenant!

EBBE
How many have seen or handled a
land mine?

Most of them raise a hand.

EBBE (CONT'D)
How many have disarmed one?

Only a few hands.

Ebbe walks over to the table. He picks up a German teller
mine.

EBBE (CONT'D)
Who has seen one of these before?

Most of them put their hands up.

EBBE (CONT'D)
Good. They are also the most
common ones.

The two soldiers pass the mine around for inspection.

EBBE (CONT'D)
For an optimal impact these mines
are buried 15 to 20 centimeters
below the sand. This makes them
relatively easy to find.

Ebbe picks up another type of mine.
EBBE (CONT'D)
Who knows what this is?

Everyone puts their hand up.

EBBE (CONT'D)
Yes, you.

Ebbe picked Wilhelm, the youngest of the boys.

WILHELM
It is a Schrapnell mine,
lieutenant.

EBBE

Correct. We call it Bouncing
Betty. This kind of mine is always
placed in the heather or in the
dunes. If the grass is not too
long they are visible - in most
cases.

Ebbe puts two schrapnell mines on the table. He strings
an almost invisible wire between them.

EBBE (CONT'D)
A thin metal wire is strung between
them. If you trip it, one or
more mines will launch a meter
into the air and ...

Ebbe gestures an explosion.

EBBE (CONT'D)
Ka-BOOM! Out comes hundreds of
little iron pellets. Not good!

INT. SLEEPING QUARTERS/ BARRACKS - NIGHT

Sebastian and the boys are in their beds. Most have gone
to sleep. Sebastian looks around. Ernst (one of the
twin brothers) is having a nightmare. Werner(17) his
brother carefully wakes Ernst up. He whispers to him.
Holds him. Ernst calms down. Werner keeps watch over
his brother.

Sebastian closes his eyes.
EXT. ARMY BARRACKS - DAY

Following day. Sebastian and some of the other boys are
crawling around in a giant sand box. Ebbe, flanked by
two soldiers, is walking among the boys. Ebbe speaks
while observing the boys.

EBBE
Faster, everyone! Each one of
you must disarm at least 6 mines
an hour!
Cut to:

A bit further away. Carl is over by a barn. He is loading
wooden planks onto a trailer. Peter (39), a Danish soldier
is helping him.

While working Carl looks over at Ebbe.
Peter looks at Carl.

PETER
I thought you two were inseparable?

Carl doesn't answer. He keeps loading the trailer.
Peter stops.

PETER (CONT'D)
In my opinion you should put it
behind you, Carl. The war has
ruined too God damn much already,
right?

CARL
Did anyone ask for your.opinion?

PETER
No, but I am just saying, that he
did everything he could to help
you from over there.

Carl looks at Peter. He goes over to him. Carl puts his
face right up against Peter's. This makes Peter nervous.
Carl smiles at him.

CARL
Did he? And what do you know
about it, little Peter? How did
he help me, exactly? Or my dad
for that matter? None of you did
shit. You all sneaked out and
ran. You call that help?

Peter Says nothing.
CARL (CONT'D)
3 years we were locked up. Not
you. Not him!
Carl gently slaps Peter on the side of the head.
CARL (CONT'D)
And what did you do, exactly,
over there in Sweden? Tell me.

PETER
We were mobilizing.. Training.
CARL
Mobilizing ... More like hiding
out and fucking all the Swedish
women and having a good time.

CARL (CONT'D)
And then you return all hero-like..
After the danger is gone, promoted
with pretty new ranks?

Carl looks at Peter's uniform.

CARL (CONT'D)
What are you now? Senior Sergeant?
How the fuck did that happen?

Peter says nothing.

CARL (CONT'D)
Is there anything else you want
to say to me?

Peter shakes his head.

CARL (CONT'D)
No? I didn't think so. So keep
your mouth shut.

Cut to:
Ebbe is walking in between the boys.

EBBE
60% of the mines you will be de-
mining are made from non-metals.
That is, things like concrete,
plastic, glass or like this one,
wood.

EBBE (CONT'D)
What do you think that means for
you guys?

No one answers.

EBBE (CONT'D)
Nobody?

EBBE (CONT'D)
It means that the metal detectors
you see over there are absolutely
useless to you.
(Ebbe points)

Ebbe holds up his little wooden stick.
EBBE (CONT'D)

This stick, however, can.
(MORE )
EBBE (CONT'D)
Unlike me, the stick is now your
new best friend.

Suddenly Ebbe whacks one of the boys Ludvig (16) across
the hands with the stick.

EBBE (CONT'D)
Boom! You just lost your hands.

Ebbe is standing over him.

EBBE (CONT'D)
Keep going. Go on. There is no
time to feel sorry for oneself.

Ludvig fiddles with the mine once more. Ebbe whacks him
again.

EBBE (CONT'D)
Boom! You are dead.

EBBE (CONT'D)
Again!

Ludvig fiddles again. His hands are red from the blows.

EBBE (CONT'D)
Boom! I believe we have our first
terminal casualty here. You don't
want to see your family again?

EBBE (CONT'D)
Are you really going to be the
first one to die?
Ludvig mumbles.

EBBE (CONT'D)
What? I can't hear you.

LUDVIG
No.

EBBE
No, what?

LUDVIG

No, lieutenant! I am not to be
the first one to die!

EBBE
I am happy to hear it! Try again.

Ludvig's hand are shaking. He tries again.

EBBE (CONT'D)
Boom! Dead again.
10.

Sebastian and the other boys are taking note of what is
happening, while they are prodding away in the sand.
Manfred (16) is digging next to Sebastian.

MANFRED
Idiot.

Ebbe hears it. He comes over to Sebastian and Manfred.

EBBE
Is there anything you want to
share with the group?

Ebbe addresses Manfred.

MANFRED
No, sir!

Ebbe looks over at Sebastian.

SEBASTIAN
No, sir. I have nothing I want
to share with the group.

EBBE
No really. I saw you smile. Do
tell. Lord knows, your friends
here could do with something to
smile about.

SEBASTIAN
It was nothing.
EBBE
Are you sure?
SEBASTIAN
Yes, sir, lieutenant. Absolutely

sure.

Most of the boys look down again and keep searching for
mines.

EBBE
Show me what you got then!!

Sebastian prods with the stick, carefully.

Sebastian hits something. He carefully digs with his
hands. A teller mine (a practice mine) appears. He
quickly disarms it. He picks it up and puts it away. We
see that this is his fifth one.

EBBE (CONT'D)
What is your name?

Sebastian doesn't answer.
10

11.

EBBE (CONT'D)
What is your name soldier?

SEBASTIAN
I didn't think the lieutenant was
interested in knowing our names,
sir?

Ebbe whacks Sebastian's fingers with his cane. Sebastian
pulls his hands back.

EBBE
Good work. Keep it up.

Ebbe walks on.
EBBE (CONT'D)
Remember that your stick is your
best friend now. Your own little
magic wand!

Ebbe stops behind one of the others boys - Helmut(19) (the
boy who took Sebastian's bed). Ebbe whacks Helmut's hands.

EBBE (CONT'D)
Boom! You are dead too!

Helmut pulls his hands back.

EBBE (CONT'D)
Get moving! Show me some magic!

Ebbe stops and looks over at Carl, who drives off ina
jeep.

INT. SLEEPING QUARTERS / BARRACKS - NIGHT 10

 

Sebastian is sitting / lying down with some of the other
boys in the sleeping quarters. The boys are talking in
hushed voices. Manfred(16) is telling jokes.

LUDVIG
Tell it again..

MANFRED
No, I don't want to.

Ludvig laughs.
WILHELM
Go on, we want to hear it too. I
will tell one afterwards.
Beat.
MANFRED

Okay then..
(MORE )
12.

MANFRED (CONT'D)
So Hitler and Géring are standing
on top of the Berlin radio tower.
Hitler shakes his head and says,
"Berlin sure isn't what it used
to be, eh?" G6dring shakes his
head.

MANFRED (CONT'D)
Hitler looks at Géring and says
how he longs to put a smile back
on the lips of the Berliners.
G6ring looks at Hitler and says,
"Then why don't you go ahead and
jump?"

The boys all burst out laughing. All, except Helmut. He
is stone-faced.

Manfred smiles at Helmut.

MANFRED (CONT'D)
Come on, man. That is funny.

Helmut looks at Manfred.

HELMUT
Yeah? What was the funny bit?

The others laugh even harder.

HELMUT (CONT'D)
I don't see what is so funny.

MANFRED
Well, you know ... It would have
prevented the war.

HELMUT
Yeah, I get that. And? You think
that is funny?

The others don't know whether to continue laughing or ...
Helmut looks angrily at Manfred.
HELMUT (CONT'D)
Why are you shaking your head!?
Because of me?
Manfred doesn't answer.
HELMUT (CONT'D)
You think you are funny? Or do

you think I am stupid?

MANFRED
No.
13.

HELMUT
What then?

Manfred doesn't answer.

HELMUT (CONT'D)
You! I am talking to you.

MANFRED
No, of course not. I am just
goofing around, man.

HELMUT
You think this is funny?

He spreads out his arms to include their whole situation.
Manfred doesn't answer.

HELMUT (CONT'D)
What about this? Is that funny?

Helmut gets up and grabs hold of Manfred.
Sebastian steps between them.
SEBASTIAN
Hey, calm down. He was just joking
around, right?
Manfred nods.
Helmut lets go of Manfred and turns to Sebastian.
HELMUT
You want somthing? You think you

are special, don't you?

SEBASTIAN
No.

HELMUT
Then why don't you stay the fuck
out of it? Do you think that you
are better than the rest of us?
Sebastian doesn't answer.

HELMUT (CONT'D)
Where did you serve?

Again, Sebastian doesn't answer.

HELMUT (CONT'D)
Do you know what I did?

HELMUT (CONT'D)
I was an officer.
14.

SEBASTIAN
So?

There is high tension in the air.

HELMUT
So? I will tell you what. You
would never have been able to do,
what I did in the war. You know
why? Because you lack courage! A
good leader and soldier should
have courage and never show fear.

Sebastian doesn't answer.
Helmut is right in front of Sebastian. Right in his face.
In a calm voice he says.

HELMUT (CONT'D)
You think I don't know your kind?
Is that what you think? You think
I don't recognize a stupid little
blue-collar boy, when I see one?

Helmut smiles.

HELMUT (CONT'D)
Oh yes. A stupid little working-
class nobody. That is what you
are, right?

Sebastian suddenly looks up at Helmut. With a quick
movement Sebastian grabs Helmut by the throat with one
hand. He tightens his grip. Helmut tries to get Sebastian
to let go. Sebastian stares straight into Helmut's eyes.

SEBASTIAN
You! I don't know you. You ask
me all these questions and think
you are entitled to an answer?!
Why?

Helmut can hardly breathe.

SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
Why?

SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
You don't wanna know, where I
was. If I told you, where I was
and what I did, you would be
shitting your pants right now ...

Beat.

SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
Are we clear ..?
11

15.

Helmut manages to nod even though he can barely breathe.
Sebastian lets go of Helmut.

Beat.
Helmut is stunned. He goes back to his bed.

The others are quiet.

EXT. ARMY BARRACKS / SANDBAG SILO - MORNING 11

 

Ebbe, flanked by two soldiers, is in a kind of silo made
from sandbags. The boys are standing around them. In
the middle on the ground lies a teller mine. Spread out
with amble distance between them are several other teller
mines.

EBBE
These mines are not dummy mines.
I repeat; they are not dummies!

EBBE (CONT'D)
This means that if you slip up,
you will either get hurt very
badly or die. Do I make myself
clear?

EVERYONE
Yes, sir.

EBBE
Good. Who volunteers to go first?

Nobody answers.

EBBE (CONT'D)
Either someone will volunteer or
I will pick one. There is no way
around it. You are all going to
disarm a real mine today.

Still no reply.
EBBE (CONT'D)
You didn't think that your first
live mine would be on the beach,
did you?

Helmut raises his hand. Ebbe sees it, but ignores him
and points to one young Wilhelm(15).

EBBE (CONT'D)
You! Yes, you. Come over here.

Wilhelm stands to attention in front of Ebbe.
16.

EBBE (CONT'D)
You will go first.

WILHELM
Thank you, sir.

EBBE
When you have disarmed the mine,
you leave through there. You
bring the top of the mine out
with you, as proof. Understood?

WILHELM
Yes, lieutenant.
EBBE
Good. The rest of you come with

me.

Ebbe, the two soldiers and the rest of the boys leave the
silo.

EBBE (Shouting) (CONT'D)
Are you ready in there?

WILHELM
Yes, lieutenant.

EBBE
Begin!

Wilhelm begins. His hands are trembling. (CU) The mine.
Wilhelm does it. He wipes the sweat from his brow and
leaves the silo.

He shows the lieutenant the fuse.

EBBE (CONT'D)
Good.

Wilhelm puts it in the box that one of the soldiers is
holding.

The boys are lined up.

EBBE (CONT'D)
Next.

Helmut goes in.
Ebbe shouts.

EBBE (CONT'D)
Ready?

HELMUT
Ready, lieutenant.
17.

EBBE
Begin!

Helmut is quick. He comes out and throws the fuse in the
box.

EBBE (CONT'D)
Well done, and quick. Good!

Ebbe pats Helmut on the shoulder. Helmut almost grows 3
feet from the praise.

Ludvig tries to hide his nervousness. His hands are
shaking out of control. He clutches them behind his back.
It is as if time is standing still for him. He hardly
notices how the line is getting shorter and shorter, that
it will be his turn very soon.

Now only Sebastian, Ludvig and Manfred remain.
Sebastian goes in. He comes out again, almost immediately.

Ebbe is surprised. Helmut smiles. His eyes say ‘finally
everyone sees that I am both quicker and more brave than
Sebastian’.

Sebastian lifts up his arm, opens his hand. The top of
the mine - the fuse - is in his hand. He puts it in the
box.

SEBASTIAN
That would be one disarmed mine,
Sir.

Sebastian smiles. So does everyone else. Except Helmut.
Sebastian winks at Ludvig, when he walks past him.

SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
You've got this.

With heavy steps Ludvig walks into the silo. He stops
just inside the entrance. Ludvig looks at the mine, then
at all the disarmed ones. He goes over to the mine.
There are only two left. Ludvig sits down and looks at
the two mines, then he picks one up. (CU) the mine. His
hands are shaking.

Outside Sebastian, the boys, the two private soldiers and
Ebbe are waiting.

EBBE (shouting)
Come on. The others would have
done the lot by now.

Inside the silo. Ludvig hears Ebbe's cry faintly. His
right hand slowly turns the fuse.

Outside. Ebbe looks at his watch.
18.

EBBE (CONT'D)
Are you asleep in there?

No answer.

SEBASTIAN
Permission to go in and get him,
sir?

EBBE

Not a chance!

EBBE (CONT'D)
God damn it!

Ebbe goes over to the silo.

EBBE (CONT'D)
I am coming in!

Ebbe enters the silo.

When Ebbe comes into the silo, Ludvig is sitting in the
middle cross-legged looking at the mine.

Ludvig slowly looks up at Ebbe.

LUDVIG
I can do this..

EBBE
Get up.

LUDVIG

No, I can do this.
EBBE
Put that mine down right now,
soldier! That is an order!
LUDVIG
No, I can do this! I want to do
it.
Ebbe looks at Ludvig's shaking hands.
The boys outside cover their ears.

Ebbe comes out.

Ludvig turns the last of bit of the top. Nothing happens.
He carefully disconnects the copper wires. He did it.

Ludvig gets up. He proudly exits the silo. He drops the
top in the box. The others applaud. Even Ebbe is smiling.

The only one who hasn't been in yet is Manfred(16). He
looks at the boys.
12

13

14

19.
Ebbe sends in Manfred.
The others are still thrilled that Ludvig made it.
Suddenly there is a huge explosion.
Black smoke pour out of the silo.
Fade to black
Cut to:
EXT. WEST COAST - MORNING 12

Total (bird's eye) of the Danish North Sea coastline.
The dunes, the bunkers, the sea, a truck is driving along
the sea front on a gravel road.

INT. ARMY TRUCK - MORNING 13

As in the beginning Sebastian and the boys are back in an
army truck. They look at each other and out through the

back at the Danish landscape. They are down to 11 boys.

One of them is missing. Manfred.

A Danish soldier is standing at the back of the truck.
He reads aloud from an official set of rules.

SOLDIER (in German)
1. At all cost avoid interfering
with Danes.

SOLDIER (CONT'D)
2. All German de-miners are under
strict curfew.

SOLDIER (CONT'D)
3... Maintaining law and order is
now a task overseen by the Danish
authorities.

SOLDIER (CONT'D)
4. Under no circumstances is
anyone allowed to mingle with
Danish civilians.

SOLDIER (CONT'D)
5. Attempt of escape will be
punishable by prison or prison
camp.
Cut to:
EXT. GRAVEL ROAD / WEST COAST - DAY 14

The army truck stops. This is the end of the line for
them. The boys jump off the truck which drives off.
15

16

17

20.

The boys are assembled in the quietness. They look around.
They are outside a barbwire fence. A sign says: Achtung
Minen! Danger Mines! No Access!

In front go the entrance are two guards armed with guns
and rifles. Sebastian and the boys pass the guard point.
They head down the the small gravel road. Towards the
dunes and the sea.

EXT. GRAVEL ROAD / WEST COAST - DAY 15

 

The boys march along a gravel road with barb-wire on either
side.

CUT TO:

The boys and Sebastian reach an old tarred wooden fishing
hut inside the fenced off area. The hut is right in the
middle of the dunes. It is a beautiful setting.

If it hadn't for all the barbwire and the fencing it would
have been scenic.

Not far from the fishing hut is a little run-down two-
winged farmhouse. We see, that a girl (5) is playing just
outside the farmhouse.

EXT. FISHING HUT - DAY 16

A military jeep with a trailer pulls up in front of the
fishing hut. The boys, who were sitting down, get up and
stand to attention. Carl is driving the jeep. He stops
the jeep in front of the hut. He looks casually at the
boys before he jumps out and walks over to the farmhouse.

Carl knocks on the door to the farmhouse.

It takes a while before Karin(52), the owner of the
farmhouse, opens the door. They talk a little before
Karin puts on her wooden clogs and follow Carl across to
a barn. They stop in front of a traditional wooden door.
Karin unlocks it.

INT. CARL'S ROOM - DAY 17

Inside. A tiny room with a low ceiling. Carl goes in
first. The room has a simple bed with a mattress, a small
table and a chair.

His expression says it all. He is clearly not happy with
the standard of the accommodation.

KARIN
I know it is not much, but ...

CARL
No, it's fine. We appreciate
that you can accommodate us.
18

21.

Karin is just standing there. She looks at Carl somewhat
perplexed. Carl notices.

CARL (CONT'D)
Yes?

KARIN
I don't know if I need to mention
it, but I don't want any Germans
near the farmhouse. The fishing
hut is okay. As long as they
stay over there.

Carl looks up at Karin and smiles.

CARL
They will keep to the hut.

Karin smiles.

KARIN
Okay then ... if you need anything
or have any questions, let me
know.

CARL
Okay.

Karin goes out and closes the door.

Carl sits on the bed a while. Carl takes out a bottle of
whisky from his bag. He pours himself a glass. He drinks
it down.

EXT. FARMHOUSE - AFTERNOON 18

Carl comes back out. He walks over to the fishing hut,
where the boys are still standing to attention.

Carl whistles. Carl's dog, Otto, comes running from the
jeep and over to Carl. He plays with it. Carl fill upa
bowl of water and sets it down. The dog drinks from the
water.

Carl washes his neck and hands from the tap on the outside
of the farmhouse. He fills up his canteen.

Carl sits down on the stairs to the fishing hut. The dog
comes over and sits next to him. He strokes it.

The sun is high in the sky and it is hot.

Carl is carrying a gun and wearing an English army uniform,
with a red arm band with yellow text saying "Dansk
Minekontrol".

Carl drinks again. The boys are thirstily eyeing his
canteen, and the tap.
22.
Carl gets up and stands in front of the boys. He looks
at the boys. He looks tough. The boys are still standing
to attention.

Carl goes over and stands in front of one of the boys.

Wilhelm (15) is the youngest of the boys. Evidently.

CARL
Name?

WILHELM
Hahn. Sir.

CARL
First name?

WILHELM

Wilhelm Hahn. Sir.
Carl moves on to the next boy.

CARL
Name?

HELMUT
Morbach. Helmut Morbach. Sir!

He stands in front of the twins.
CARL

And you two. I take it that you
two are brothers?

WERNER
Twins, sir!

CARL
Really? And you are?

WERNER
Lessner. Werner and Ernst Lessner.
Sir.

CARL
Did I ask about your brother's
name?

Carl stares at Werner and is about to move on.

WERNER
Sorry, sir.

Carl stops. He smiles to Werner.

CARL
Sorry for what?

Werner just stands there for a while.
23.

CARL (CONT'D)
Sorry for what? What exactly are
you apologizing for, huh?
Werner looks down.
WERNER
For saying my brother's name,
sir.

Carl slaps Werner in the face.

CARL
Look at me when I am talking to
you!
Werner looks up.
Carl smiles.
CARL (CONT'D)
Try again. What are you
apologizing for?

WERNER
I am not surel...

Carl slaps him in the face again.
CARL
What do you want to apologize
for?

Werner doesn't say anything.

CARL (CONT'D)
Speak up, man!

WERNER
I don't know what I am supposed
to say, Sir!
Carl leans in close to Werner and whispers in his ear.

CARL
Do I really need to tell you?

Werner looks timidly at Carl. Hesitantly he says:

WERNER
The war?

Carl looks at him and around on all the boys. He slaps
him on the shoulder.

CARL
Your excuses are no good to me.
24.

WERNER
Yes, sir. Sergeant, sir!

Carl now looks at Ernst.

CARL
Name?

Ernst replies quietly.
ERNST
(quietly)
Ernst. Lessner. Sir!

CARL
Speak up, boy!

ERNST
Ernst Lessner, sir.

Carl moves on. All the boys are a little uneasy. They
can't figure him out.

CARL
Name?

LUDVIG
Hafke. Ludvig Hafke, sir.

Carl goes around to everyone and comes to the last boy.

CARL
And you?

SEBASTIAN
Schumann. Sebastian Schumann.
Sir.

Carl goes a bit further back and faces the boys.
Carl looks. at his dog.

CARL
What do you say, Otto? Shall we
let the boys have some water?
Shall we? Do you think they are
thirsty or what?

The dog (Otto) shakes his tail. Carl crouches down. He
lets the dog lick his face.

He looks at the boys.

CARL (CONT'D)
You may go get some water.

EVERYONE
Thank you, sir!
19

25.

The boys run over. They take turns filling up their
canteens. Drink. They drink like they have never tasted
anything sweeter in their lives.

EXT. DUNES - AFTERNOON 19

A little later. Carl is walking through the dunes. The
boys walk after him in single file.

They reach the top of the dunes. Carl stops. He looks
out across the sea and down to the beach. Despite the
bunkers and all the barbwire spread out along the beach,
it is a stunning sight for Carl and the boys. Waves crash
onto the beach.

Carl walks down the dunes and onto the beach itself. The
boys follow. Single file. He climbs onto a bunker, 6
meters up.

EXT. BUNKER - DAY 20
Carl is standing on top of the bunker looking down.

CARL
Come up here.

The boys climb up.

Carl is balanced on the very edge of the bunker. He leans
into the wind. The wind is strong enough to hold him at
an angle without him falling over.

Carl looks back at the boys. He smiles.

CARL (CONT'D)
Can you see the black flag down
there?

Carl points to the north along the beach. The boys look
for the flag. They see it. It is a long way away. At
least 500 meters.

EVERYONE
Yes, sir.

Carl turns around and looks south. He points again.
Down the beach is another flag.

CARL
In the area between those flags
and the road are 22.000 mines.

CARL (CONT'D)
You will disarm all of them. You
do this, and you get to go home.
Do you understand? Then you can
go home. But not a second before.
(MORE )
26.

CARL (CONT'D)
With six mines an hour, and
provided you don't blow yourselves
up, it will take you three months.

EVERYONE
Yes, sir.

The boys grimace despairingly.

Carl turns and look at Sebastian. Sebastian looks at him
skeptically. Carl goes over to him.

CARL

Do you want to say something?
SEBASTIAN

No, sir.
CARL

Are you sure?

SEBASTIAN
Absolutely sure, sir!

Carl looks at the boys. He stands there for a while.
CARL
Do I need to point out what happens
to anyone who tries to escape?

EVERYONE
No, sir!

Cut to:
The boys are ready with long sticks and long yarns of

string. Carl is crouching on the sand. He scoops away
some sand to reveal a wooden beam just below the sand.

CARL
Can everyone see these?
EVERYONE
Yes, sir.
CARL

These rafters run from the dunes
down towards the sea approximately
every 150 meters. You can step
safely up to 1 meter on either
side of such a rafter. Some are
almost impossible to see, some
have rotted away. You must find
every single one of these rafters
in the area, before we begin. It
is absolutely essential that we
clear the beach systematically in
a precise grid.
27.

CARL (CONT'D)
You start by clearing out a safe
path here. We need a passage
from here and all the way up to
the dunes. Is that understood?

EVERYONE
Yes, sir.

Beat.

CARL
You. Yes, you with the map.

Carl looks at Ludvig.

LUDVIG
Ludvig, sir.

CARL
Come here.

Ludvig quickly goes over and stands to attention in front
of Carl.

CARL (CONT'D)
Did they teach you to read maps
in your training?

LUDVIG
Yes, sir.

CARL
What is the name of the area we
are standing in right now?
Ludvig looks down at the map. Not sure.

CARL (CONT'D)
Guess!

LUDVIG
Area number 3, Sir!?

Carl smiles.
CARL
Try again. This time give me the
correct answer.

Ludvig is sweating nervously.

Sebastian next to Ludvig points to area number 7 on the
map. Carl sees this, but makes no comment.

LUDVIG
Area number 7, sir.
28.

CARL
Correct! And how many mines are
buried within this area, according
to the map?

Ludvig looks at the map. He is not sure. He looks to
Sebastian for help.

CARL (CONT'D)
We want an answer today, Ludvig.

Ludvig spots a number next to area 7, but he is still not
sure.

LUDVIG
1200 mines, sir!?

Carl smiles.

CARL
Correct! This area is to be your
main throughway, your safe zone
to and from the beach. From here
we work our way into the other
areas. We always use this passage
when going up to the house or
carrying disarmed mines up to the
pickup point by the road. No
shortcuts through other areas.
Is this clear to everyone?

EVERYONE
Yes, sergeant!

CARL
There are mine maps for almost
all. the areas.

The boys are standing around him as Carl points to the
map.

CARL (CONT'D)
The area is defined by a number -
the dots or stars tell us what
type of mine we are dealing with.
The number is always in the left
corner.

CARL (CONT'D)
Those of you who will be in charge
of the count must make sure that
these mine maps are always up-to-
date. This task is as important
as the de-mining itself. Don't
you ever forget that!! This map
is the only thing, that proves
that a given area has been cleared
of mines. Do you understand?
29.

EVERYONE
Yes, sir.

Helmut walks a few steps into the sand to get a better
look.

Carl sees it. He lets him stand like that for a moment.

CARL
Stop!

Helmut stops and turns.

CARL (CONT'D)
What is your name, soldier?

HELMUT
Helmut, sir.

CARL
Helmut ..

HELMUT
Yes, sir?

CARL
Helmut, are you stupid?

HELMUT
No, sir.

CARL

Well, do you have a death wish?

HELMUT
No, sir.

Carl looks really irritated at Helmut.

CARL
How many meters from the raft did
I say?

HELMUT

One meter, sir!

Helmut looks down. He realizes that he has walked 3-4
meters onto the beach.

Helmut freezes. Carl turns around and walks away. From
a safe distance he shouts.

CARL
The rest of you, come with me.

The boys look at Helmut and then follow Carl.

Otto, Carl's dog, stays and looks at Helmut.
21

22

30.

HELMUT
Here boy, come here, boy.

Carl whistles. Otto turns around and runs to Carl and
the other boys.

Helmut just stands there for a while. Then he nervously
walks back towards safety.

Cut to:
Carl with the boys up by the road.

CARL
You.

Carl points to Sebastian.

CARL (CONT'D)
Repeat!

SEBASTIAN
This is where we deposit the
disarmed mines that we do not
detonate ourselves. The teller
mines are to be lined up in
straight lines of 25 each. With
the front of the mine pointing
forward.

CARL
And?

SEBASTIAN
Always remember the mine count
and take down the precise number.
Every time.

Carl stands a while. Then smiles.

CARL
Good.

EXT. DUNES - EVENING 21

Sebastian and Wilhelm are walking along the gravel road.
They are gathering blocks of dry grassy peat. Nobody
speaks.

We see the other boys doing the same.

INT. FISHING HUT - EVENING 22
Sebastian and Wilhelm are standing in the door way of

their sleeping quarters, the tiny fishing hut. It isa

small room with bunk beds that have no mattresses. A
smoky, tarry smell hangs in the air.
31.

They place the blocks of peat on the bunk beds, to sleep
on. Helmut is there too. Wilhelm looks at Sebastian.

WILHELM
This is not so bad ... this whole
thing.

Sebastian doesn't answer.

WILHELM (CONT'D)
So what are you going to do when
we get back home?

Sebastian doesn't answer.

WILHELM (CONT'D)
I am going to be a machinist. My
dad's friend owns a factory. A
real nice place. He will take me
in as an apprentice.

Beat.
WILHELM (CONT'D)
That's good, right? He promised

me that I can start as soon as I
get back home.

Helmut smiles sarcastically.

HELMUT
Aren't you forgetting a minor
detail?

SEBASTIAN

Stay out of this.
Wilhelm looks puzzled.

HELMUT
Why? He might as well understand
that his bright future is a fairy
tale fantasy.

WILHELM
It is no fantasy. It is reality.
He already promised me.

HELMUT
And what if ...

Sebastian stops Helmut.

SEBASTIAN
Stop it.

Wilhelm doesn't really understand what is going on.
23

32.
Helmut stays quiet. He shakes his head .
WILHELM
(to Sebastian)
If you want, I could ask if he
will take in one more apprentice?
Beat.

WILHELM (CONT'D)
Only if you want to?

Sebastian fakes interest.

SEBASTIAN
Sure. Yeah. That would be great.

Wilhelm smiles. Helmut gets up and leaves. He shakes
his head.

WILHELM
No problem. I will ask him. I
am sure they can use one more.
Especially when I tell them how
good you are.

Beat.
WILHELM (CONT'D)
Then we could go to work together
each day.

SEBASTIAN
Yeah.

Sebastian forces a smile.

EXT. FISHING HUT - EVENING 23
The sun is low on the horizon. The boys are sitting

outside the fishing hut. Carl is eating his food a little
distance from the boys. In his jeep. The boys are eyeing

the food hungrily.

WILHELM
Look at him.

Carl puts his plate on the ground. Carl's dog, Otto,
quickly laps up the food.

Wilhelm looks at Sebastian.
Carl gets up and walks over to the boys.
He stands in front of them.

CARL

If anyone has to piss, this is
the time to do it.
24

INT/EXT. FISHING HUT - EVENING

33.

24

The boys are in the house. Carl puts a board across the

door and lock the boys inside.

Carl goes back across to his jeep.
and drives off.

He starts up the engine

The boys just sit there. Looking at each other.

INT. PUB IN THE VILLAGE - EVENING

Ebbe walks in through the door to a

25

crowded pub. He looks

around. He sees Carl in the bar, drinking. He walks

over.

Ebbe sits down in the bar. There is a barstool between

them. They don't apeak.
Long beat.

CARL

Rank or not. You still look like

a little boy.
Ebbe smiles.

EBBE
Well, I would rather be a

boy in

charge than a powerless old timer.

Carl smiles.

CARL
Congratulations ..

It really hurt him to say that.
Ebbe smiles.

EBBE

Thanks.. It means the world coming

from you.

Carl sucker-punches Ebbe on the shoulder.

EBBE (CONT'D)
ow!

Ebbe sits there a moment. Then he punches Carl back.

Carl smiles.

Ebbe sits a while. Then he leans forward.

EBBE (CONT'D)
Listen. I know you think
perhaps you should be the

that
one

wearing these instead of me.
34.
Ebbe points to his lieutenant insignia.
CARL
Just count yourself lucky that
you and I are friends. And you
don't want to know what I think.
Beat.
EBBE
Hey, man. You are good at what
you do, Better than me ..
Carl punches Ebbe again.

CARL
You still look like a little boy.

Ebbe sits a while. Ebbe smiles and points to his insignia
on the shoulder.

EBBE
You see these? I think you should
show me the respect I deserve.
Carl smiles.

CARL
You want my respect?

EBBE
Yeah.

Carl sucker punches Ebbe in the face.
EBBE (CONT'D) (CONT'D)

God. damn it. You fucking punched

me!
Carl sits a while.
Carl smiles.
An officer comes over. He grabs Carl by the shoulder.
Carl gets up and pushes him off. He stares at him

viciously.

EBBE (CONT'D)
Look. It is fine. I deserve it.

The officer stays. He is staring at Carl.
EBBE (CONT'D)
Hey, did you fucking hear me? It
is fine. He is a friend of mine!

The officer leaves.

They sit a while.
26

27

28

29

35.

EBBE (CONT'D)
I am sorry about your dad..

CARL
Yeah, so you say.

EBBE
I am serious, Carl. I am really
fucking sorry about it. I know
you think I didn't try to do
anything about it. But I did ..

Carl turns and looks Ebbe straight in the eyes.
CARL
Listen, let's just forget it,
okay? I moved on. You moved on.
I can see you have. It is just
the way life is.
Ebbe sits there a while.
CARL (CONT'D)
Order a drink for us. No»more
talk..

Ebbe sits a while. Then he turns to the bartender. He
motions him over.

Cut to:
INT/EXT. FISHING HUT - MORNING 26

The sun comes in through the windows where the boys are
sleeping. Sebastian is awake.

INT. CARL'S ROOM - MORNING 27

Carl is sleeping. He wakes up with a jolt. Next to him
in the bed is a half-naked woman.

INT/EXT. FISHING HUT - MORNING 28

Carl looks pretty thrashed. He removes the board in front
of the door and opens. The boys hear him.

CARL
Five minutes, and we are out of
here!
EVERYONE
Yes, sir.
EXT. BEACH - DAY 29

The boys have been ordered to begin de-mining. They are
crawling along, spread out evenly along the beach in a
long line.
30

36.

Carl is observing from a safe distance. The dog is by
his side.

The area they are in has already been precisely measured
out into smaller squares.

Sebastian is inching himself along, carefully prodding
the sand in front of him using his stick. He is moving
ahead of the others.

Suddenly his feels something. He yells out.

SEBASTIAN
I've got one, sir.

CARL
Good!

Someone else shouts out as well.

HELMUT
Here is another one.

WERNER
Me too!

ERNST
And here.

WILHELM
I have one.

LUDVIG

There is one here.
They all cry out, they have all found one.
Total.
Panorama of the entire beach.
This task seems endless.
Foam from the salty waves tumbles playfully across the
beach in the wind. The sight is strangely mesmerizing
++» even beautiful.
EXT. GRAVEL ROAD / WEST COAST - DAY 30
Later. The sun is shining. It is very hot. Ludvig,
Werner and Ernst are dragging a trolley full of disarmed
mines along the gravel road. They can see Carl and his
dog further down the road. The trolley is heavy with its
load of disarmed mines.

LUDVIG

First two things when I get back
home ... Beer and pussy.
37.

Werner looks at Ludvig and smiles.

WERNER
Yeah? You have a girlfriend back
home?

LUDVIG

No.. But it is the first thing I
am gonna get. Believe me..

WERNER
What about your mum and dad?
Aren't you going to find them
first?

LUDVIG
Hey, they will have to wait..

Werner laughs.

LUDVIG (CONT'D)
What about you guys? What are
you gonna do?

Ernst shouts back across his shoulder from the front of
the trolley.

ERNST
Make money! Work and get rich,
right Werner?

WERNER
That is correct, my friend.

LUDVIG
What kind of work?

ERNST
Bricklayers .. What else? The
entire Reich has been bombed to
oblivion. It needs rebuilding,
and that is where we come in:
‘Werner, Ernst & Sons’.

LUDVIG
And sons?

ERNST
Yeah, when we have kids they will
take over the company.

Werner smiles.

WERNER
It just sounds bigger if we call
it sons. I mean we'll be the
owners AND the sons. But nobody
will know that.
31

38.
LUDVIG
Pretty clever. Maybe I should do
that too. Ludvig & Son. Gota
nice ring to it, don't you think?
WERNER
Yeah. Almost as nice as Werner,
Ernst & Sons.
Ludvig laughs.

LUDVIG
But first: Beer and pussy, right?

They laugh.
Cut to:

Carl is showing the boys how to stack the mines correctly
by the side of the road.

Ludvig has accounted for the mines on the mine map.

CARL
How many personnel mines?

LUDVIG
32, Sergent!

CARL
Stock mines?

LUDVIG
56, Sergent!

Carl counts.

CARL
Correct!

The boys are waiting. Carl is waiting for them to make a
move.

CARL (CONT'D)
What are you standing around for?
Get going!
The boys run off with the trolley.

Carl walks after them. The dog is by Carl's side at all
times.

EXT. BEACH - AFTERNOON 31
Later. Sebastian is disarming yet another mine. He is

sweating profusely now and his hands are shaking. He
almost messes it up. But he makes it.
39.

Behind Sebastian are 9 disarmed mines already. He
carefully places the 10th one with the others

Helmut seems annoyed that Sebastian's speed. The others
are nowhere near as fast as Sebastian.

They are all belly down on the sand. Several have taken
off their uniforms in the intense heat.

Wilhelm the youngest of the boys are on top of the dunes.
He throws a handful of sand down onto the boy below in
the sand. The sand startles the boy. When he looks up.
Wilhelm ducks down out of sight.

William does it a few times. The boy finally gets up and
looks around. Still nothing to see.

BOY
Stop it! It is not funny!

No reply. Wilhelm is still ducked down out of sight. He
is clasping his mouth, in tears laughing.

BOY (CONT'D)
I know that somebody is there ..

Wilhelm makes no reply. The boy gives up and goes back
to work.

A little while later Wilhelm is about to do it again.
This time Carl is standing right behind him. Carl pushes
Wilhelm with his leg, so he falls to the sand. He steps
on Wilhelm's hand, pushes it down into the sand. Wilhelm
is in pain. Carl looks at Wilhelm's pile or disarmed
mines: only two.

CARL
You wanna stay here forever?

WILHELM
No, sir.

Carl yells in Wilhelm's face.

CARL
Then stop playing and get to work!!

WILHELM
Yes, Sergent!

Further down the beach we see several more German POV de-
mining platoons, they look like lines of tiny ants crawling
on the beach.

Suddenly we hear a thud from far away. A cloud of smoke
appears on the horizon. Cold fear runs through the veins
of the boys. A reminder of what happens, if they are not
careful.
32

40.
The boys get up. They look at the cloud of smoke. Then
they keep going. Nobody says anything. They know that
it could just as well have been one of them.
CARL

Six mines an hour!! Get on with

itl!
The boys lie down on the sand and get back to work.
EXT/INT. FISHING HUT - EVENING 32
Later. Outside the fishing hut. Some of the boys are
sitting outside. Wilhelm is sitting on an old fence trying
to use a leaf of grass to whistle.

Two other boys have a little throwing game going where
they take turns throwing stones into a boot.

The doors and windows to the hut are open. Sebastian is
lying down inside, looking out the window. He can see
the others outside. Sebastian is building a wooden frame.
The little girl (Elizabeth) from the farmhouse is walking
around just outside the barbwire surrounding the area of
the fishing hut. Sebastian smiles when he sees her.

She is dressed in a home made dress - vaguely resembling
a princess' gown. She is pushing an old-fashioned pale
blue baby stroller with a doll in it.

She walks up to the fence. She looks at the boys sitting
outside. Initially, the boys ignore her.

The twins Werner and Ernst are sitting next to each other.
Werner smiles at the girl.

Helmut is sitting close by. He looks at the twins.

The girl walks back and forth a couple of times. She
picks up her doll from the cart and shows it the boys.

The doll is very worn and almost all its hair has fallen
out. She strokes the doll's bald head.

She holds up the doll, so the boys can get a good look.

The girl moves the arm of the doll so it looks like it is
waving.

Werner waves back and smiles.

Suddenly the girl picks up a piece of bread and takes a
bite from it. She puts the bread back in the doll's pram.

Werner, one of the twins, sees this and goes to the fence.

Werner crouches down and smiles to the girl.
41.

WERNER (in German)
What is her name?

The girl looks at Werner, perplexed.

WERNER (CONT'D)
Do you understand German?

The girl smiles.
GIRL (in Danish)
Today is her birthday. She turns

five.

Werner knows that she doesn't understand him. But then
again, he also has no clue what she is saying either.

Sebastian can see and hear everything that is going on
outside.

WERNER (in German)
Well, she is really cute.

GIRL
You can all attend her birthday
party, if you want. There will
be layered cake and hot chocolate.

Werner reaches through the fence and strokes the doll's
head. His other hand is reaching for the bread.

GIRL (CONT'D)
She has a boo-boo. Look.

The girl points to a band-aid on the doll's leg.

Werner pulls his hand back and covers his mouth. The
girl smiles.

GIRL (CONT'D)
Ow.

WERNER (tysk)
I'll say. Ow, indeed.

Werner takes out a tiny strip of gauze from his pocket
and reaches for the doll. Through the barbwire.

WERNER (CONT'D)
May I?

The girl hands him the doll. Werner carefully wraps the
doll's leg.

WERNER (CONT'D)
There you go. As good as new.

The girl touches the gauze and smiles.
42.

GIRL
Thank you.

WERNER (in German)
You are welcome.

Suddenly Karin, the girl's mother, is standing behind the
barbwire to the farmhouse.

KARIN
Elizabeth. Elizabeth!! Get over
here right away!

Karin runs over and grabs the girl by the hand. Pulls
her away. Away from them.

KARIN (CONT'D)
Come on.

The girl is resisting. She doesn't want to follow.

KARIN (CONT'D)
What is wrong with you? Come
here!

Karin pulls the girl along. The girl reluctantly lets
herself be pulled away.

On the way back the little girl turns around and waves.
Werner waves back. He smiles at both of them. The mother
ignores him.

Werner straightens up and goes back and sit down. Helmut
gets up and stands directly in front of Werner.

HELMUT
We were told; No contact with
Danish civilians!

Werner ignores Helmut.

HELMUT (CONT'D)
Are you deaf?

Sebastian looks out at them through the open door. Werner
gets up and stands in front of Helmut. He puts his face
an inch in front of Helmut's face.

WERNER
Did you want something, Mr.
officer?

Helmut stands there a moment. Werner shows no fear. Helmut
turns around and goes into the fishing hut. From behind
his uniform Werner takes out the bread he took from the
girl. He tears it in half and gives Ernst half.

WERNER (CONT'D)
Eat, brother.
33

43.
INT. FISHING HUT - CONTINUOUS 33

Helmut sits down on his bed. Unties his boots and takes
them off.

He looks at Sebastian, who is still sitting on his bed.
Helmut lies down. He clutches his stomach. He is hungry.

SEBASTIAN
You are good at making friends,
huh?

HELMUT
Mind your own business.

Beat.

HELMUT (CONT'D)
You know, just because you are
quick, doesn't make you the leader.

SEBASTIAN
Good. I don't want to lead
anybody.

Beat.

HELMUT
Arr.. why the fuck can't we get
some food.

Beat.

HELMUT (CONT'D)
I know what you all think of me.

SEBASTIAN
No, I don't think you do. But
most of us here recognize an
asshole from Rotherbaum, when we
see one.

Helmut is somewhat surprised that Sebastian knows where
he comes from.

EXT. FISHING HUT - EVENING 34

Carl locks the hut off. He walks back across to the farm
house.

EXT. FISHING HUT - MORNING 35
The following day. The boys are standing to attention

looking at Carl who is eating, sitting down on the stone
doorstep. There is no food for the boys.
36

37

38

44,
EXT. THE BEACH - DAY 36

Later. The boys are de-mining the beach. Carl is on top
of the dunes eating a sandwich. The boys look up at him.
They are starving by now.

LUDVIG
He is eating again. Right in
front of us. I bet he is sitting
there just to rub it in.

SEBASTIAN
Forget it,Ludvig.. Just keep
working.

LUDVIG

What a fucking pig.
EXT. FISHING HUT - EVENING 37

The boys are sitting outside looking across to the farm.
There is a light behind the windows. Carl's door is open.

HELMUT
I think Sebastian should do it.

None of the boys say anything. Sebastian looks at Helmut.

HELMUT (CONT'D)
Those who want Sebastian to do it
raise your hands.

Only a couple of boys raise their hands.

HELMUT (CONT'D)
What is with you guys?! Are you
not hungry?

(to Sebastian)

And you ... why don't you do
something? You think we don't
notice how he looks at you. You
are his favorite. You ..

SEBASTIAN

He has no food! Don't you get
it? And if he had food, he would
never give it to us! He doesn't
care about us. They all hate us.
Get it into your heads! We are
here, because they don't give a
shit if we die.

Helmut is shocked by hearing the truth. Despondent he
sits down.

INT. FARMHOUSE - EVENING 38

Sebastian carefully opens the door.
45.

He carefully opens the door. Slowly, he enters. Inside
is another door.

Sebastian knocks again, politely.

CARL
Yes?

SEBASTIAN
It is me, Sebastian. Sorry,
Sergeant.

Carl is lying on the bed. An almost empty whisky bottle
is on the table. Carl is drunk. He looks up at Sebastian.

SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
Sergeant, sir. Sorry for the
disturbance.

CARL
What do you want?!!

CARL (CONT'D)
Answer me, boy!

SEBASTIAN
I am here on behalf of everyone,
Sergeant.

CARL
And?

SEBASTIAN

We just wanted to hear if the
sergeant has maybe heard anything
about any food?
Sebastian is just standing there.
Sebastian tries to say something, but Carl cuts him short.

SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
I think that if we don't get some..

CARL
WHAT do you think?

Carl gets up.
Beat.
He stands in front of Sebastian.

CARL (CONT'D)
What exactly do you think?

Carl grabs hold of Sebastian's face and and shoves him up
against the wall.
46.

CARL (CONT'D)
Do you think I feel sorry for
you?!

SEBASTIAN
No, sir.

CARL
I don't give a shit about you.
Do you understand?! You can all
die for all I care.
Beat.

SEBASTIAN
I know that, sir.

Carl smiles and lets go of Sebastian.
CARL
You know that? What else do you
know if I may ask?

Sebastian stands there for a moment.

CARL (CONT'D)
What do you know?

SEBASTIAN
I know that the sergeant do not
care about us.
Carl looks at Sebastian. Carl looks furious.

Beat.

CARL
Good night, Sebastian.

Sebastian is about to leave.

CARL (CONT'D)
And Sebastian?

SEBASTIAN
Yes, sir?

Carl smiles.

CARL
I think it will be better, if you
stick to the fishing hut. No
contact. Remember that.

SEBASTIAN
Of course, Sergeant. Good night.

INT. FISHING HUT - EVENING 39
Sebastian comes in. Everyone is looking at him with great
expectations. Sebastian shakes his head. Helmut shakes
his head.

SEBASTIAN
I told you ...

The disappointment on their faces is clear. They are
starving.

Sebastian goes in and lies down on his bed and shuts his
eyes.

EXT. FISHING HUT - EVENING 40

Helmut is behind the fishing hut. He is loosening some
boards.

Cut to:

Carl puts the board across the door to the fishing hut
and locks up.

INT. FISHING HUT - NIGHT 41

Helmut is in bed. He is awake. He looks around on the
other guys who are sleeping. He crawls out of bed.

Wilhelm sees him.
WILHELM

(whispering)
Are you running away?

HELMUT
(whispering)
Shh.. No.
WILHELM

Where are you going?

HELMUT
I am going to find something to
eat. Go back to sleep. I'1l be
back soon.

Helmut crawls out through the hole in the wall.
EXT. BEACH - MORNING 42

Following day. CU Carl. We see that he is looking at
Werner and Ernst (the twins). Ernst is shaking.

WERNER
Honestly, Sergeant. He can't
keep going.

(MORE )
48.

WERNER (CONT'D)
I know my brother, sir. I have
been watching him the entire
morning. He keeps throwing up.

Ernst looks like a walking dead.

CARL
Ernst?

ERNST (mumbles)
It is true, sir. I am sorry. I
don't feel well. I don't know
what it is. I just feel sick as
a dog. If only I could go lie
down. Just for an hour.

CARL
Ernst, you know I can't accept
that.

ERNST

I know, sir. But I am really
feeling sick.

They stand there a while. Carl looks sternly at the twins.

Ernst looks up. Carl forces a smile. He lifts up his
hand and gently touch Ernst's chin.

CARL
Aw.. What a shame.

ERNST (mumbling)
I am begging you ..

CARL
I'm sorry. I can't hear you.

ERNST
I am begging you, sir.

Carl looks down at Otto the dog that is sitting next to
him.

CARL
We could let him rest for an hour.
What do you say Otto? Should we
believe them? Or are they trying
to trick us?

Carl looks at Ernst. He smiles at him.
Beat.

CARL (CONT'D)
Get back to work.
43

49.

WERNER
Sir?

CARL
You heard me. Get back to work!

Carl looks at Werner. Smiles. He puts his index finger
across his lips. Signaling that the conversation is over.

WERNER
Yes, sir.

Ernst and Werner go back along the beach.

EXT. BEACH - MORNING

Later. Sebastian is disarming a teller mine. He is
struggling. It is not going his way. Sebastian curses.
In the end he manages to get it done.

EXT. THE BEACH - MORNING

Wilhelm, the youngest of the boys, is not far from
Sebastian. He looks in a terrible state. His hands are
shaking violently. He blows on his hands, as if to warm
them up. He suddenly vomits.

EXT. GRAVEL ROAD - MORNING

Meanwhile. Carl is up by the road. During the night,
someone has put up a scarecrow wearing German uniform.
They have used a round teller mine for the face.

Someone has painted smiling face on the mine and written
“Die you German swine".

GUARD
Should we take it down, sergeant?

CARL
Leave them.

Carl walks back down the gravel road. Towards the fishing
hut.

EXT. BEACH - DAY
Meanwhile. Sebastian stops working his own line, gets up
and walks over to Wilhelm, who looks like he is in trouble

with one of the mines.

Suddenly the mine goes off. Sebastian who was on his way
over is thrown back by the blast.

EXT. FISHING HUT - DAY
Carl is down by the fishing hut. He hears the explosion

and looks up. He sees the cloud of black smoke coming
from the beach. Otto the dog is barking.

43

48

50.
Carl sits down and puts his arms around the dog.

CARL
There goes the first one...

EXT. BEACH - DAY 48

Sebastian gets back up. He pats himself down to check if
he is wounded. He runs to Wilhelm.

Sebastian sees that Wilhelm, apart from being wounded to
the face and all over his body, is also missing both his
arms. Wilhelm looks up at Sebastian, smiling.

WILHELM
I am fine ... I am fine ...

Sebastian smiles back.

SEBASTIAN
That is good, Wilhelm, that is
good. It doesn't look too bad.

WILHELM
If I could just rest for bit.
Maybe just for an hour. Then
I'll be good to go ..

The other boys on the beach are frozen in their positions -
in their own areas.

Sebastian is calmly holding Wilhelm. Evidently this is
not the first time he has dealt with death and mayhem.

Sebastian looks up at Helmut, Ernst and Werner. He yells.

SEBASTIAN
Help me!!

They do not react.

Sebastian starts to put pressure on the wounds to slow
down the bleeding by wrapping his belt around what is
left of Wilhelm's arms. Sebastian looks at Helmut who is
standing a short distance away.

SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
Helmut. I need your help. We
need to get him off this beach.
Helmut is still horrified. He doesn't react.

Sebastian starts lifting and dragging Wilhelm across the
sand. He is looking for someone to come and help him.

SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
For christ's sake, help me, Helmut!
49

51.

Helmut is just standing there, catatonic. Werner now
comes running over to help.

WERNER
What are you doing? Help him,
for Christ's sake!!
Werner grabs hold of Wilhelm.

SEBASTIAN
We need to get him up to the house.

Werner and Sebastian carries Wilhelm up through the dunes,
towards the fishing hut.

EXT. FISHING HUT - MORNING 49
Gently they put Wilhelm down on the ground.

SEBASTIAN
Hold this tight!

Werner doesn't do it right.
SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)

No, like this. Tightly, Okay?

You got him?
Werner nods.
From the farmhouse Karin peers out his front door,
curiously. She quickly shuts the door once she realizes
what has happened.
Sebastian runs over to the jeep and finds a first aid
kit. He opens it. It is half empty. He empties the
contents of the bag on the ground. Other than a bit of
gauze there really isn't anything of use.
Cut to:

Sebastian applies pressure and wraps gauze on Wilhelm's
arms, trying to prevent him bleeding to death.

Sebastian yells for Carl.

SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
Sergeant!!

Wilhelm is now crying and screaming. His face is a pale
white mask.

SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
Sergent!! We need you!!

Cut to:

52.
INT. FARMHOUSE / CARL'S ROOM - DAY 50

Carl is in his tiny room. We hear Sebastian's cries for
help and Wilhelm screaming.

Carl sits on the bed a while. He takes out a small leather
pouch. Inside are several ampoules of methadone. He

takes one out of the pouch.

Cut to:

EXT. FISHING HUT - DAY 51
Carl is walking towards the two boys and the wounded

Wilhelm. He kneels and breaks open the ampoule. Carl
administers the methadone to Wilhelm. He looks at Wilhelm

and smiles.

CARL
Shh...

Beat.

SEBASTIAN
Thank you, sir.

Carl doesn't say anything. He gets up and walks back.
Sebastian looks at Carl walking away. Did Carl help to

stop the screaming or because he actually felt sorry for

the boy?

EXT. FISHING HUT - DAY 52
Wilhelm is on the back of a military truck. A samaritan

is behind the wheel. Sebastian and Werner are looking

on. The jeep drives off.

EXT. FARMHOUSE / CARL'S ROOM - AFTERNOON 53

Later. Sebastian knocks on Carl's door. No answer.
Sebastian goes in. He is still covered in blood.

SEBASTIAN
Sergent?

Carl is lying on the bed. He looks briefly over at
Sebastian.

CARL
What did I tell you about the
farm being off limits?
Beat.

SEBASTIAN
I think we have a problem, sir.
54

53.
INT. FISHING HUT - DAY 54

Carl and Sebastian come in. Inside the boys are lying on
the floor and in the beds cramped up in fetal positions,
clutching their bellies. They are sweating and shaking.
In turns they scream and cramp up. It is a nightmarish
scene. They are all pale and seriously sick.

Both Sebastian and Carl are surprised.

In his bed Helmut props himself up on his elbow as they
enter.

HELMUT
Sergeant! Everything is my fault,
sir.

CARL

What is? What happened?

HELMUT
It is my fault, sergeant. We
were all so hungry last night,
that I went over to the farm last
night and took some animal feed.
I am sure that is what made
everyone so sick.

Carl takes it in. Then he smacks Helmut hard across the
face.

HELMUT (CONT'D)
I am so sorry, sir. I am the
only person to blame. We have
had no food for several days now.
Beat.

Carl looks furious. He looks around at the boys. Many
of them are throwing up onto the floor.

HELMUT (CONT'D)
I am so sorry, sir.

Carl hits him again.

CARL
Shut up!!

Beat.

CARL (CONT'D)
Did everyone eat it?

HELMUT
Everyone except Sebastian, sir.

Carl looks at Sebastian.
55

56

54.
EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY 55

Carl knocks on the door to the farmhouse. No one comes
to the door.

Carl knocks again. Hard this time.

The daughter opens. She looks at Sebastian, who is
standing behind Carl. Karin comes to the door.

KARIN
What is he doing here? I told
you that I want nothing to do
with them. No contact. That was
the deal.

CARL
Come with me.

INT. BARN - DAY 56

Carl pushes open the barn door. Carl and Sebastian enter.
Karin follows.

KARIN
When I tell you, that there is
nothing edible in here, I am not
kidding.

They look around. Evidently it has been many years since
this was a farm with animals.

CARL
They said that they had stolen
some animal feed from in here.
Karin walks down through the empty barn
KARIN
As you can see, there is nothing
here.

Carl stops at the stairs leading to a small loft.

CARL
What is up there?
KARIN
What do you mean? This is the hay

loft.
They go up. Upstairs is a sack of very old animal feed.

CARL
What is in that one?

Karin looks into the sack.
57

55.

KARIN
If they have eaten from this it
is no wonder they got sick. It
is full of rat shit. You see?

Karin picks some of it up in his hand. She shows it to
Carl and Sebastian. She can't help smiling.

KARIN (CONT'D)
Hell, that right here could kill
a horse.

CARL
And what is funny about that?

KARIN
So I finally did get me a few
Germans after all.

KARIN (CONT'D)
Hey, they can finish it off if
they like.

Carl and Sebastian leave.
EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY 57

Carl and Sebastian cross the yard. Karin and the little
girl are watching them from the door.

SEBASTIAN
What was she laughing about?

Carl stops. He looks at Sebastian.

CARL
Let me just clarify one thing for
you. You and I don't talk. You
understand? You don't speak to
me. I ask you, and the you answer.
And you address properly. Are we
clear?

SEBASTIAN
Yes, sir!

Carl and Sebastian walk across the yard.

CARL
Why didn't you eat any of it?

SEBASTIAN
He didn't offer it to me, sergeant.

Carl acknowledges his answer.

EXT. THE BEACH - DAY 58

Sebastian is down by the edge of the sea, he is filling
up a big canteen with sea water.

EXT. FISHING HUT - DAY 59

The boys are lined up. They are drinking sea water. And
throwing up.

SEBASTIAN
Listen up! You have eaten rat
shit. All of you. Which can be
fatal. So get it all out of you
system.

Sebastian helps out where he can.
SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)

Yes, I know. It is horrible.

But you have to swallow it. Drink

it down. empty those stomachs.
The boys vomit, emptying their stomachs. Carl is sitting
some distance away. Watching the spectacle. He shakes
his head.
INT. FISHING HUT - AFTERNOON 60
Later. The boys are sleeping. Shaking, freezing, sweating.
Cut to:
Sebastian nails the two boards back around the back of
the hut. He checks the rest of the hut for loose boards.
Carl follows him around, making sure it is done properly.
Nobody speaks.

EXT. FARM HOUSE / CARL'S ROOM - EVENING 61

 

Carl is drinking whisky, outside, alone. He throws a

stick across the yard. Otto happily retrieves the stick

over and over.

EXT. FISHING HUT - EVENING 62

Carl is standing in front of Sebastian, who is sitting
outside.

CARL
Get inside!

Sebastian gets up. He looks at Carl.
SEBASTIAN
Permission to show you something,

sir?

Carl nods.
63

64

57.

Sebastian goes into the hut and comes out with the frame
he built earlier. He has attached 4 strings to it so
they make 9 squares.

Sebastian puts the frame on the ground. He puts a stick
in each square.

Carl is impressed although he doesn't show it. This will
no doubt lessen the risk and make the de-mining work
easier.

SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
I know how much the sergeant hate
us. And that the sergeant don't
care where we die of starvation
or get blown up by a mine. But I
believe that it will look much
better for you if we die on the
beach, de-mining ... Sir.

Beat.
SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
I mean the beach has to be cleared,
right?
Beat.

CARL
Get in the house.

Sebastian stands there for a moment.

CARL (CONT'D)
Get inside, I said!

Carl puts the board across the door to the hut. He stands
there for a moment. He walks back across the yard.

INT. FISHING HUT - CONTINUOUS 63

Sebastian is sitting inside the fishing hut looking at
the sick boys.

INT. KITCHEN / BARRACKS - MORNING 64

The following day. Carl walks down a long hallway. We
follow him from behind. He goes through a door and into
a kitchen. He is alone. Carl looks around. Then he
goes into the pantry. He fills a crate with potatoes,
onions and loaves of bread.

Suddenly a chef enters. He looks at Carl.

CHEF
What are you doing here?
65

66

58.

CARL
What does it look like? I am
being the fucking gofer and picking
up the food you should have
delivered to the officers already.

CHEF
I haven't heard anything about
that.
CARL
Du you want to go and deliver it
yourself?
The chef doesn't answer.

CARL (CONT'D)
I didn't think so.

Carl smiles to the chef and leaves.

EXT. BARRACKS - MORNING 65
Carl is driving through the barracks’ military area. He

drives past the military hospital and stops. He sits

there a while. The he backs up to the red cross building.

INT. WOODEN BARRACKS / RED CROSS - MORNING 66

Carl enters the building. It is very busy and there are
lots of wounded patients.

Carl speaks to a nurse.

CARL
Good morning.

NURSE
Good morning...

CARL
Wilhelm Hahn? His hands had been
blown off. They brought him in
the other day.

She checks a journal.

NURSE
Wilhelm passed last night.

Carl stands there a moment.
NURSE (CONT'D)
He is still here if you want to

see him?

CARL
No, thanks.
67

59.
Carl turns around and goes back out again.
EXT. FISHING HUT - MORNING 67

Carl puts the box of food in front of the fishing hut.
He unlocks the door and goes over to his own place.

Cut to:

Sebastian is ladling out food to the boys. It is a thick
broth of potatoes, onions and bread. They all look better
already. He boys sit outside the hut. They wolf down
the food as if it was their last meal ever.

Sebastian looks thankfully over at Carl who sits some
distance away looking at them.

Cut to:
Later. Carl is now over by the fishing hut.

CARL
Attention, everyone ..!

The boys look up.

CARL (CONT'D)
I have good news and bad news.

Beat.

CARL (CONT'D)
The good news is that I have just
been to see Wilhelm. They are
taking good care of him and he is
well, considering the
circumstances. The most important
thing is that he will survive.
And as soon as he is well enough,
he will go back to his family.
He sends his regards to you all.

Helmut looks relieved. The boys are happy.
Carl stands there a moment looking at the boys.

CARL (CONT'D)
The bad news is that we are far
behind on our schedule, and we
have to sped up a lot. We will
be doing long shifts with a minimum
of 8 mines an hour for the rest
of the week.

CARL (CONT'D)
Understood?

EVERYONE
Yes, sir!
68

69

70

60.

CARL
Be ready in ten minutes.

The boys get up and run into the house to get ready.

Carl looks at Sebastian. There is something about his
gaze.

EXT. THE BEACH / THE DUNES - DAY 68
The boys are once more clearing mines. Their pace is

quicker now. It seems like they have been re-energized.

And they are using Sebastian's new invention, the frames.

Carl walks around among them. He shouts:

CARL
Eight mines an hour!! Tempo!

Cut to:

Carl whistles loudly. That is the signal for the end of
the shift.

Cut to:

the boys are walking through the dunes. Towards the
fishing hut. They look exhausted.

EXT. FISHING HUT - EVENING 69
Carl locks the door to the fishing hut.

Fade to black

Cut to:

EXT. FARMHOUSE / CARL'S ROOM - NIGHT 70

 

A few days later. Carl is lying on his bed. He is asleep.
An empty whisky bottle is on the table. A half-naked
woman (one we haven't seen before)

We hear a lot of noise coming from the yard out in front.
People are laughing and yelling.

Carl wakes up and gets up with great difficulty. He opens
the door and looks out. By the hut is a truck and two
jeeps.

Carl looks at the woman who is rummaging around for her
clothes.

CARL
You just stay there until I tell
you you can go! Do you understand?

Carl puts on his uniform and goes outside.
71

61.
EXT. FISHING HUT - EVENING 71
In front of the fishing hut Ebbe and a group of high-
ranking Danish and British officers are standing in a
circle. They are laughing loudly and are obviously drunk.

Ludvig is on his knees in the circle. In front of him is
an English officer. He is pissing all over Ludvig's face.

Carl comes over.

EBBE
Good evening, Carl..

CARL
What the hell are you doing?

EBBE
What we are doing? What does it
look like, Carl?
Ebbe grabs Carl by the shoulders in a friendly manner.

EBBE (CONT'D)
We are having a bit of fun.

Carl doesn't comment on Ebbe's comment.

CARL
I'll say..

Ebbe smiles.

EBBE
Right?

Another officer steps into the circle and starts peeing
on Ludvig's face. The officer is laughing.

Carl is looking on. Sebastian and the other boys are
standing just near by.

One of the officers takes out his hand gun. He aims it
at the boys. He changes his aim from boy to boy.

A third officer steps forward to piss on Ludvig. He pulls
out his dick, but nothing comes out. He can't piss. The
others laugh.

BRITISH SOLDIER
Shit in his mouth instead!

The others laugh.

The officer laughs and pulls his pants down and turns
around. He sits places his ass over Ludvig's face.

OFFICER GARTH
Open your mouth, Nazi boy!!
62.
Ludvig is crying.

Carl looks around at this madness. Something inside a
transformation takes place. He is repulsed by these Danish
and British officers.

The officer with the gun goes over and points it at Ludvig.

OFFICER GIVENS
Do as your fucking told, Nazi
boy!! Open your goddamn mouth!!

Ludvig opens his mouth.

The others are laughing loudly. Sebastian jumps in and
protects Ludvig.

OFFICER GIVENS (CONT'D)
Aww, isn't that sweet. Two nazi
brothers looking out for each
other.. Think I won't just shoot
you both?

The officer puts the gun to Sebastian's head.

OFFICER GIVENS (CONT'D)
How ‘bout I start with you, eh?

Suddenly Carl steps in. He puts his hand on the gun.

CARL
As much as I would like to see
him dead too, I need him on the
beach..

Beat.

The British officer turns around a sends Carl a look.
Carl smiles back to him. He is calm.

CARL (CONT'D)
I need him down there, okay? I
need all of these boys down there.
6 mines an hour, remember?

Carl points towards the beach. After a while the officer
smiles at Carl.

OFFICER GIVENS
Just having a laugh, eh?

He pats Carl on the shoulder. He shouts to the others.
OFFICER GIVENS (CONT'D)
Alright, we should get going,
boys.

Cut to:
63.

Carl is next to Ebbe and the Brits behind a truck. On
the back is a bunch of metal detectors. A guy takes a
few of them and drops them on the ground.

Ebbe and Carl are standing next to each other.

CARL
This is not cool, Ebbe.. I had
just managed to get a real good
pace going on the beach..

EBBE
What is this I hear about you
picking up food for the Germans?

CARL
Yeah? Where did you hear that?

EBBE
Is it true, though?

CARL
I picked up some food for myself.
I have a healthy appetite... And
a few bits for my dog.

EBBE
If I were you I wouldn't even
think about doing that again. It
upsets people, you know? They
get uptight.

CARL
You mean it upsets you?

EBBE
Maybe I just find it very peculiar
that you need to go and get food,
when we are paying the old farmer
here very generously for your
board and lodging.

Ebbe doesn't answer.

EBBE (CONT'D)
Do you hear what I am saying,

Carl?
CARL

Yeah, yeah. I hear you, Ebbe.
EBBE

Hey, look at me when I am talking

to you!

Carl turns to Ebbe.
64.

CARL
I hear you ... And now I see you
too .. Do you hear me?

CARL (CONT'D)
You forgot to tell me that I would
be given a bunch of German kids.
That pretty much changes the whole
damn situation, don't you think?

EBBE
Does it? I don't see why. If
they were old enough to go to
war, they are old enough to clean
up after it.

CARL
I want you to help me get some
older and more experienced men
for my unit.

Beat.

EBBE
Do you know what they call it
when a child steals?

Carl smiles.

EBBE (CONT'D)
Oh, you know this one?

CARL
You are not answering my request.

EBBE
Yes I am. Just listen carefully.

Ebbe smiles.

EBBE (CONT'D)
If a child steals, it is called a
‘mania’. Right? If grown-ups
steal, it is 'klepto-mania'. You
with me so far?

Ebbe smiles.
EBBE (CONT'D)
But what is it called when a
country steals?

Ebbe provides the answer.

EBBE (CONT'D)
‘Ger-mania'!

He bellows with laughter at his own joke. Carl is stone
faced.
65.

CARL
None of these boys have a clue
about what they are doing...

Ebbe smiles.

EBBE
Well, you will just have to teach
them then, won't you? After all,
that is why you are here..

Ebbe smiles and looks at Carl.

EBBE (CONT'D)
They are Germans, Carl. Young,
old ... all Germans. Relax.
Enjoy life, for christ's sake..
It is just a bit of payback, right?
If we lose a couple here and there,
so be it. It is part of the job.

Ebbe smiles to Carl.
EBBE (CONT'D)
You haven't started caring about
the enemy have you?
CARL
Fuck no. I mean, they don't mean
shit to me.

EBBE
Good. Better them than us, right?

CARL
Yeah .. Hell, yeah.

EBBE
Good, Carl. You had me worried
there for a second..

CARL
No, no. It's all good, you know?

Carl clenches his fist. Ebbe sees.
Ebbe looks at Carl. He pats him on the shoulder.
EBBE
See you later, my friend. Enjoy
your Saturday...

72 EXT. GRAVEL ROAD / WEST COAST - MORNING 72

Carl is by the road. He is looking at the three
scarecrows. The two guards are standing next to him.

CARL
Why is this still here?
73

66.

GUARD
Sir?

CARL
Get rid of it.

GUARD
But?

CARL
Now!!

The two guards crawl over the ditch and start taking down
the scarecrow.

Carl looks over at a big stack of disarmed mines by the
roadside.

CARL (CONT'D)
And get someone to come and pick
up these mines immediately!

GUARD
Yes, sergeant!

EXT. BUNKER - EARLY EVENING 73
Sebastian is sitting on top of a bunker. The sun is huge,

very beautiful and almost completely red. Carl climbs up

and joins him. He sits down.

Carl look out across the sea. The wind is blowing gently
in his face.

SEBASTIAN
I would like to thank you, sir.
CARL
For what?
SEBASTIAN
For pretending to look out for
us, sir.
CARL

You think I don't mean it?

SEBASTIAN
It doesn't matter that much, sir.
It helps them. That is what is
important.

They sit for a moment.

CARL
Wilhelm didn't make it.

SEBASTIAN
I know, Sergent.
Sebastian

67.
looks at carl.

SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
It was for the best, Sergent.

SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
So we could get on with the mines.
So we can go home ... eventually.

A necklace with a small silver cross hangs around

CARL
It is alright... I am not going

CARL (CONT'D)
Does it help you?

SEBASTIAN
Sometimes.. Sir.

it to Carl.

SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
Try holding it, sir.

smiles.
CARL
No, thanks.
SEBASTIAN
Yes, go on, sir. Try holding it.
CARL
No, thanks.
SEBASTIAN
Really, take it, sir. Try holding
it.

Hesitantly Carl reaches for the cross.

SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
BOOM!

Carl jumps up. They both laugh.

68.

SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
My dad gave it to me. That is the
main reason I wear it. He always
did that. Gave me a fright every
time. That is mainly why I wear
it.

They sit a while without saying anything. Carl gets up.

CARL
Good night, Sebastian.

SEBASTIAN
Good night, sergeant.

Carl gets up and leaves.

Sebastian remains.

EXT. FISHING HUT - EVENING 74
Carl puts the board across the door to the hut. He stands
there for a moment. Then he removes the board and goes

back to the farm.

EXT. THE BEACH/THE DUNES - DAY 75
The following day. Sebastian is on the beach. The sun is
shining. He is disarming a mine and is about to lift it

up, when he sees another mine just underneath it. Two

mines on top of each other.

SEBASTIAN
Shit!

Sebastian puts it back carefully. He gets up and shouts
to the others. They can't hear him.

SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
Ludvig! Stop! There are two mines
on top of each other!

Ludvig hears him and stops.

LUDVIG
What is the matter, Sebastian?

SEBASTIAN
They've put two mines on top of
each other!

LUDVIG
What? I can't hear you.

CUT TO:
Werner and Ernst (the twins) are far away. They are doing

their sweeping routine with three meters between them.
They can't hear Sebastian.
69.

Werner is cursing the mine in front of him. He struggles
to disarm it. But finally gets it done.

WERNER
Ahh.. I got you, you little
bastard.

Ernst suddenly hears the other boys shouting at them.

ERNST
Hey, Werner, stop. The others
are shouting at us. Something is
wrong.

Werner keeps on working.

Werner lifts up the mine. He smiles. Suddenly his facial
expression changes. Underneath the mine is another mine.
Werner looks over at his twin brother, Ernst. An enormous
explosion goes off. The effect of two mines. Werner
evaporates.

Ernst's face gets splattered by the blood and flesh of
his own brother. He is stunned. Then he jumps up and
runs desperately over to Werner's area.

He looks for his brother, calls out his name. Werner is
spread all over the place. Ernst staggers about inside
the mine field, confused, shocked looking for pieces of
his twin brother.

He screams. Ludvig and Sebastian come over. They
overpower Ernst and hold him down.

Helmut who has seen everything just sits there, stunned,
his hands keep on working, though.

Out of the corner of his eye, he sees a piece of Werner's
body stuck in a low sand pine tree just off to his side.
Helmut works faster and faster.

Sebastian runs over and try to stop him.

SEBASTIAN
Helmut stop!

Helmut pushes Sebastian away.

HELMUT
Leave me be.

Sebastian tries again.

HELMUT (CONT'D)
Leave me be!

Helmut gets up and pushes Sebastian to the ground.
76

70.

HELMUT (CONT'D)
What do you want? What do you
want from me?!! You have
everything. Do you understand!
You have won!

Helmut sits down and begins working. He is crying.
Carl comes running.

CARL
That is enough, soldier! You are
a danger to us all, when you are
digging like that!

Helmut keeps digging. Carl draws his gun. He points it
at Helmut.

CARL (CONT'D)
Stop or I will shoot you!

Sebastian gets up.
He speaks calmly.

SEBASTIAN
Helmut. Stop. You hear me? Stop
digging.

Helmut stops digging.

Sebastian sits down and holds him. Helmut breaks down
crying.

SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
Helmut, look at me.

Helmut can't look at him.

SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
Helmut, look at me. It is okay.
You hear? It is okay. We need
your strength now. I need you.
You hear? We must stand by each
other now, right?

Helmut looks up.
Helmut believes him. He smiles through his tears.

Carl looks at them. And at Sebastian. Then he finally
lowers the gun.

EXT. THE BEACH - DAY 76

Later. Four of the boys are carefully walking in the
minefield picking up the bits and pieces of Werner. They
put it in buckets. It is very macabre. The mood is very
heavy.

INT. CARL'S ROOM - AFTERNOON 77

Carl finds the leather pouch. He takes out an ampoule of
methadone.

INT. FISHING HUT - AFTERNOON 78

Sebastian and Helmut are sitting by Ernst in the hut.
Ernst is on the bed shaking.

Carl enters. He sits down. Carl breaks off the top of
the ampoule and injects it into Ernst's arm.

ERNST
Sergent. Is that you? Have you
found my brother? We have to go
down and get him. We can still
save him.

CARL
We will look again tomorrow, it
is too dark now.

ERNST
Okay. Good. That is good ..

Helmut and Sebastian look at Carl. Carl pats Ernst on the
shoulder.

CARL
Just sleep now, okay?

Ernst dozes off.

Carl gets up and leaves.

Fade to Black.

EXT. GRAVEL ROAD / WEST COAST - DAY 79

A jeep stops. Two young German boys (Gustav(19), Albert
(17)) that we haven't seen earlier sit in the back.

The jeep drives off.

The two German boys look around. Everything is quiet.

They are standing just outside the guards and the barbwire
fence.

They gather themselves and go through the gate. Down the
gravel road. Down towards the dunes and the sea. Towards

the fishing hut.

EXT. THE BEACH - CONTINUOUS 80

The boys are in the shallow of the sea. Carl's hund is
running around with the boys. They are having fun.
72.

The two new boys are standing on top of a dune. Carl
sees them. He calls Ludvig.

CARL
Ludvig!

Ludvig looks up at Carl. Carl points to the two new guys.
Ludvig runs up to them.

LUDVIG
Hello.
GUSTAV
Hello. Is this the de-mining
unit?
LUDVIG
Yes.. We are it.
GUSTAV

We are supposed to join your
platoon. Where is Sergent
Rasmussen?
LUDVIG
Yeah, that is him over there.
But you can report to me.
Ludvig smiles to them. Holds out his hand.

LUDVIG (CONT'D)
My name is Ludvig.

GUSTAV
Gustav Becker.

ALBERT
Albert Bewer.

LUDVIG
Come with me.

The new guys follow.

LUDVIG (CONT'D)
We are not working today.

They walk down to the sea.
Cut to:

Helmut and Sebastian are standing in the wet sand. They
are about to have a competition.

SEBASTIAN
Are you sure you want to do this?

HELMUT
Are you?
81

73.
The smile at each other.

HELMUT (CONT'D)
1-2-3-Go!

Sebastian and Helmut race along in the wet sand near the
water.

The run. They are both very fast.

They have a bet going. Whoever reaches the black flag
down at the far end is the winner. It is a long way.
Helmut just gets there first. He grabs the flag and raises
it triumphantly.

Both Sebastian and Helmut collapse on the sand.

SEBASTIAN
You are crazy..

For the first time Helmut's smile is genuine.

HELMUT
Maybe..
SEBASTIAN
Peace?
HELMUT
Peace.
EXT. THE BEACH / DUNES - EARLY EVENING 81

 

Later. The two new boys, the old crew and Carl with his
dog are walking towards the dunes and the fishing hut.
Everyone is in high spirits. They are walking in area 7,
their safe passage that they cleared out initially. Carl
throws the tennis ball across a little stream that runs
down the beach. Otto runs to get it. Otto jumps through
the stream. He picks up the ball. And runs back towards
Carl.

Suddenly there is a huge explosion. Otto the dog stepped
on a mine.

Everything is dead quiet. The only sound is Otto
whimpering. The dog is not dead. Carl runs over. He
sits down. Holds the dog.

The boys stay in the background, watching. They don't
know what to do.

Helmut is about to go to them. Sebastian holds him back.

Carl lifts up the dog and walks, a lone figure, up towards
the fishing hut.

The boys just stand there. They don't know what to do.
82

EXT. FISHING HUT - EARLY EVENING

A few moments later. When the boys carefully approach the

fishing hut, Carl is nowhere to be seen.
A shot rings out from the barn.
Helmut looks at Sebastian.

HELMUT
I think one of us should go over
to him.

Sebastian shakes his head.

SEBASTIAN
Let's just leave him alone.

HELMUT
Leave him alone? Why? It was an
accident. Who knows what he might
do?

Suddenly the boys see Carl walking towards them. The
boys quickly get into their uniforms and lace up their
boots. They know this means trouble. The boys run out
and stand to attention.

Carl goes over and stands in front of Ludvig.

CARL
Private, Ludvig Hafke. You were
responsible for area number 7,
correct?

LUDVIG
That is correct Sergeant. And
everything was accounted for!
1.200 mines buried, 1.200 mines
found, disarmed and accounted
for, Sergeant!

Carl stands there. His expression has changed. He
suddenly has killer eyes. He moves his faces close to
Ludvig's. There is a lot of tension.

CARL
But everything wasn't accounted
for, now was it? You miscounted,
didn't you, soldier?!

LUDVIG
No, sergeant, sir. I counted
them several times to be sure,
Sergeant. 1.200 mines buried.
1.200 mines taken out. Sir!

Carl knocks Ludvig over and places his knee right on his

chest.
75.

He is squeezing hard on Ludvig's throat and neck, pinning
him down.

CARL
Are you calling me a liar?

The boys are very surprised at Carl's aggressive reaction.
The two new guys are shocked.

Tears well up in Ludvig's eyes. He can barely breathe.

LUDVIG
No, sir.

CARL
It sounds to me like you are
calling me a liar, soldier?!

Ludvig can't breathe. He gasps.
Sebastian run over and pushes Carl off.

SEBASTIAN
Stop it!!

Carl sits on the ground. Ludvig holds his neck. He is
crying.

LUDVIG
(while sobbing)
No, sir. I am just saying ...
that maybe the mine maps are
incorrect?

Carl smiles a sinister smile. Just like he did a lot in
the beginning.

CARL
Maybe the maps are incorrect?

LUDVIG
Yes, sir.

Carl gets up. He goes over to Sebastian and punches him
in the face. Sebastian takes the punch and keeps quiet.

Carl looks at Sebastian, then he looks at all the boys.
He shakes his head.

CARL
Idiots! You are a bunch of German
idiots. All of you. You know
that? Idiots.

The boys just stand there. Carl just stands there. He
keeps shaking his head.
83

76.

CARL (CONT'D)
What do you think will happen
next?

None of the boys speak.

CARL (CONT'D)
How can we know for sure, that
there are no more mines in that
area? How can I guarantee that
the beach is safe?

HELMUT
We could do a re-count, sergeant?
See if the numbers add up?

Carl looks at Helmut. He yells.

CARL
Fuck if the numbers add up! What
good are the numbers now? Tell
me. Can you say for sure that
that area is secured?

HELMUT
No, sergeant.

Carl stands a while.

CARL
I have been too nice to you.
That is the problem. You have
taken advantage of me and my
generosity!

Then he turns around and goes to his room.

The boys stay where they are. They look at each other,
perplexed.

INT. FISHING HUT - NIGHT 83
The boys are inside the fishing hut. Helmut is cursing
and swearing. He looks at Ludvig, who is sitting next to
Ernst, who is still in his bed.
HELMUT
You idiot! You know that? This
is your fault!

Sebastian interferes.

SEBASTIAN
Stop it, Helmut. It was an
accident.

HELMUT

No it wasn't. He miscounted.
84

77.
Beat.
HELMUT (CONT'D)
It was an act of stupidity. And
now we will all pay for it!
Nobody speaks.
HELMUT (CONT'D)
You don't get it, do you? Nobody
gets it. He practically told us.
What will happen next? That dog
could have been either one of us.
How do you know, that he is not
going to punish us?

SEBASTIAN
Because he is a good man.

Helmut rolls his eyes back.
HELMUT
A good man! What the fuck do you
know about that? Tell me!

Helmut gets up. He pushes Sebastian.

SEBASTIAN
Don't do that.

Helmut pushes again.

SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
Stop it.

Helmut pushes him once more.

The two boys jump each other. They fight hard for a long
time.

The other boys barely manage to separate them. Helmut
gets up and leaves the house. He heads down to the beach.

The other boys stay with Sebastian. Ludvig looks at
Sebastian

SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
Stop looking at me!

Ludvig looks away. Sebastian is furious.
EXT. FARMHOUSE - MORNING 84

Next day. Carl is digging a hole. He bends down and
carefully lowers the dead dog, Otto, into the hole.

All the boys are standing a little distance away. They
watch.
85

78.
EXT. THE BEACH - MORNING 85

Following day. Carl is in the dunes. He is looking down
onto the beach.

All the boys are lined up forming a long chain across the
beach. Their arms are interlinked. Two armed guards, we
haven't seen before, are standing behind them. The boys
look confused and scared.

Carl walks down there. He stands in front of them.

CARL
A mine field is secure, when we
have found and disarmed the same
amount of mines as indicated by
the map. Correct?

EVERYONE
Correct, sir!
CARL
Not correct!! A mined area is

secure, when all the mines have
been removed. What happened
yesterday clearly indicates that
you have not done your job well
enough!!

EVERYONE
Yes, sir!

CARL
Do I need to remind you that a
civilian could have stepped on
that mine?!

EVERYONE
No, sir!

CARL
From now on, every time you have
cleared an area, you will walk
through that area arm in arm,
side by side, and make sure that
no mistakes have been made. My
mistake was to place my trust in
you.

Beat.

CARL (CONT'D)
Are we clear?

The boys look at each other. They are terrified.

CARL (CONT'D)
I said, Are we clear?!
86

79.

EVERYONE
Yes, sir!

HELMUT (whispering)
I told you. He might as well line

us up against the wall and shoot
us ..

Carl hears him. He goes over to Helmut.

Carl punches him in the face.

CARL
Were you saying something, soldier?

HELMUT
No, Sergent!

Carl looks at the boys with and ice-cold stare.

CARL
Forward march!

The young boys walk in a daisy-chain across the entire de-

mined area. Fully aware that every step might literally
be their last.

CARL (CONT'D)
The entire beach. We will canvas
every inch of this beach until we
are sure.

Sebastian looks over towards Carl.

Carl turns his back to them and walks off. The two guards
stay.

EXT. BUNKER / THE BEACH - EVENING 86

Later. Carl is sitting on a bunker. He looks down at
the beach and the boys down there.

The boys are still marching arm in arm.
The two armed guards follow at a safe distance.
They have a lot more ground to cover.

One of the guards are talking to the boys. We see this
from Carl's point of view. The guard comes up to Carl.

GUARD
Sergent. They are asking if they
can have a break. And some food?

CARL
They can have some food when they
are done.
87

80.

GUARD
Yes, sir.

Carl sits and watches for a while. Then he gets up and
leaves.

INT. FISHING HUT - EVENING 87

Sebastian and the boys are sitting in the fishing hut.
They hear Carl put the board across the door and lock up.

The boys sit a while. Helmut looks around at all of them.

HELMUT
I say we get the fuck out of here
now. Before we all die.

Nobody says anything.

HELMUT (CONT'D)
Hallo? You accept this?
Personally I would rather be shot
by the Brits, than walk on that
beach one more time.

Sebastian looks at him.

SEBASTIAN
We stay until its done. Then we
go home. That is the best option.
We finish our job. The sergeant
promised that we get to go home,
when we are done.

HELMUT
And you think he is a man of his
word?

Sebastian doesn't answer.

HELMUT (CONT'D)
Well, I am getting the fuck out
of here. If anyone wants to come
along, they are welcome.

He looks around at the others. Nobody makes any response.

SEBASTIAN
You stay.

Helmut gets up.

HELMUT
If you want to do his march of
the dead, you are welcome. But
you don't tell me what to do.
Nobody does.
81.

SEBASTIAN
Yeah, that maybe so. But happens
to us when he sees that you are
gone? I cannot allow it.

HELMUT
It is not up to you. I am
leaving!!

Beat.

HELMUT (CONT'D)
You don't get it, do you? You
think he is your friend? He
detests you ... all of us! You
know the other de-mining units
use armored vehicles to check the
beaches? But us? We have to
walk. You think that is because
the sergeant is our friend?

Sebastian looks at the other boys.

SEBASTIAN
Get hold of him. Tie him down..

The other boys look at Sebastian.

SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
I said, Tie him down!

The other boys jump Helmut and ties him down on the bed.
He is yelling and screaming.

Sebastian stuffs a piece of cloth in his mouth.

HELMUT
Mmmmmmm.

SEBASTIAN
Are you going to shut up?

Helmut tries to get out but he is pinned down.

HELMUT
Mmmmmmm.

SEBASTIAN
I will only remove the cloth if
you are quiet. Will you be quiet?
Helmut nods.

SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
Are you sure?

Helmut nods again. Sebastian takes out the gag. He looks
at Helmut.
88

SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
Everybody stays ‘til we're done..

Sebastian lies down on his bed. He looks up at the
ceiling.

EXT. FISHING HUT - MORNING 88

The following day. The boys are still in their beds.
The sun is rising and the rays come in through the windows.

EXT. FARM HOUSE / CARL'S ROOM - MORNING 89

Karin comes running across the yard. She opens the door
to Carl's room. Carl isn't there.

INT/EXT. FISHING HUT - MORNING 90

Karin tears off the board to the fishing hut and opens
the door. Karin is so out of breath that she can hardly
speak.

KARIN (In Danish)
Where is the sergeant?

KARIN (in Danish) (CONT'D)
Quick, quick, you must come and
help me.

The boys are just waking up. They all look befuddled at
each other. There is no reaction from Ernst, who is still
in his own world.

HELMUT (In German)
What is she saying?

Ludvig unties Helmut.

SEBASTIAN
I don't know.

KARIN
(in Danish)
Where is the Sergeant?!!

Karin looks around frantically. Then she runs back out
again.

EXT. DUNES / THE BEACH - MORNING 91

The boys are running towards the beach. Through the dunes.
Karin is running up ahead of them.

EXT. THE BEACH - MORNING 92
When they come down onto the beach they see, what is going

on. The little girl, Elizabeth, has walked out into one
of the mine fields that has not yet been de-mined.
93

94

95

83.

The girl is standing still. Frozen. She is holding her
doll.

EXT. FISHING HUT - MORNING 93
Total of the fishing hut.
The jeep drives up in front of it.

Carl gets out of the jeep and walks over to the fishing
hut.

Carl sees that the board is on the ground and the hut is
open. He looks inside.

INT. FISHING HUT - MORNING 94

Except from Ernst with his back to him, nobody is there.
Silence. Carl walks over to Ernst.

CARL
Where are the others, Ernst?

Ernst doesn't answer.
CARL (CONT'D)
The others. Where are they? How
did they get out??
Still nothing.
Carl pulls Ernst up from the bed.
CARL (CONT'D)
Where are they, Ernst?! Have
they run away?
Ernst is blank.
EXT. THE BEACH - MORNING 95

When Carl gets to the dunes, he sees the boys.

By the time Carl gets down there, he knows what is going
on.

Sebastian and Helmut have already started clearing a
passage to the girl.

They are going as fast as they can. Struggling. Sebastian
turns around.

SEBASTIAN
It is going to take a while..

Suddenly the girl starts moving. Everyone starts yelling!

EVERYONE
Sit down!
84.

KARIN
You have to sit down, my little
darling!

The girl doesn't hear them. She smiles and waves.

Ernst suddenly appears behind the crowd. Nobody notices
him.

Suddenly he walks through the crowd. Past Carl. Past
the other boys. He steps over the barbwire and into the
fenced-off area.

Ernst walks into the mine field. Going in a straight
line. He walks past Sebastian, who is disarming a mine.
He heads straight towards the girl.

Everyone drops to the ground.
Sebastian stops working and looks up at Ernst, astounded.

But no mines go off and Ernst reaches the girl. He sits
down and smiles to her.

ERNST (in German)
Shall I take a look at her?

The girls smiles, she thinks he is Werner to whom she
spoke earlier.

GIRL
You talk funny.

ERNST (pointing to the doll)
Boo-boo?

The girl smiles and hands Ernst the doll. Ernst looks at
the bandage around the doll's leg. It is dirty. Ernst
unwraps it. And gets out a new piece of gauze from his
pocket.

He is going to wrap the doll's left leg. The girl shakes
her head. Ernst understands. It is no longer the leg
which is injured.

Ernst tries various places. Right leg? Right arm? Left
arm? In the end Ernst and the girl agree, that the doll
needs her head bandaged. They help each other wrap the
doll's head.

The girl smiles. Ernst has tears in his eyes.

Meanwhile Sebastian has cleared a narrow path through the
mine field out to the girl and Ernst.

SEBASTIAN
Ernst? Hand her to me.

Ernst lifts the girl up and passes her over to Sebastian.
96

85.
Sebastian carries her back.
Karin takes her.

Slowly everyone gets up. Ernst is still out there. He
looks at everyone and the mother, who is crying and
frantically hugging the girl.

Sebastian looks out towards Ernst.

SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
Are you coming, Ernst?

Ernst looks at Sebastian for a long time. He smiles at
him. Sebastian returns the smile.

SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
Come her, Ernst. Please.

All of a sudden. Ernst turns and walks on further into
the minefield. Ernst keeps walking. And walking ..

The others are shouting for him to stop. Sebastian is
about to run after him. Suddenly we hear a loud click.

Ernst looks down at his right leg. A shiver runs through
his body. He looks around. Looks back at the others.

At Sebastian. Somehow Ernst looks at ease, almost
relieved.

Explosion. Ernst is blown to bits. He is gone.

All that's left is a cloud of black smoke, slowly
dispersing in the wind.

Silence falls on the beach. We see the faces of the crowd.
Carl, Sebastian, the girl, Karin and all the boys. They
are quiet. The joy has been replaced by an eerie
emptiness.

CU Sebastian.
EXT. FISHING HUT - LATER 96

Carl comes walking from the farm. He goes over to the
fishing hut. Helmut and Ludvig are sitting outside.

CARL
Where is Sebastian?

Ludvig points behind the fishing hut. Carl goes around
to Sebastian.

Carl stops. He looks at Sebastian who is sitting
motionlessly , staring vacantly into the air. Carl goes
over to him. He holds out his hand to Sebastian.
Sebastian ignores Carl completely. Carl leaves his hand
in front of Sebastian for a long while. In the end,
Sebastian slaps the hand away. Carl tries again.
86.

Sebastian gets up. He looks angry. For the first time
Sebastian can no longer hold back his feelings. He pushes
Carl. Carl doesn't budge. Sebastian pushes him again.
Carl lets him. He is a lot bigger than Sebastian.
Sebastian is furious. Carl stands right in front of him.

CARL (CONT'D)
Go ahead and hit me, if that is
what you want.

Sebastian lock eyes with Carl. Then he punches Carl in
the face. Carl doesn't budge.

CARL (CONT'D)
Again. Do it again.

Sebastian hits Carl again. Carl still doesn't budge.

CARL (CONT'D)
Again..

Sebastian shakes his head. A tear runs down his cheek.

SEBASTIAN
Why do you do it?

CARL
Why do I do what, Sebastian?

SEBASTIAN
You don't care about any of us..
So why do you pretend to be my
friend? It is messed up. Hate
me, that's fine. I can take it.
But don't pretend to be our
friend!!

Carl stands there for a while.

Sebastian breaks down. Carl embraces him. Sebastian
tries to break free from his embrace.

SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
Let me go!!

Carl holds on.

SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
I said, Let me go!

Carl is still holding on. Sebastian breaks down in Carl's
embrace.

CARL
There, there. Everything is going
to be alright.

Sebastian sobs.
97

98

87.

CARL (CONT'D)
I will be there for you. I
promise. It's going to be alright.

Sebastian tries to break free from Carl's embrace one
more time.

SEBASTIAN
Let go of me. You don't
understand.

CARL

Take it easy, Sebastian... You
are done soon. It is going to be
okay. Then you can go back home
again.

Carl finally lets go of Sebastian. Sebastian wipes his
eyes. He looks into Carl's eyes.

SEBASTIAN
You are right to hate me. I ama
very bad person. If you knew
some of the things I have done..
Oh, my God.
Sebastian breaks down completely. Carl holds him again.

CARL
You did what you were told..

SEBASTIAN
No.. I did more than that..
Much more.
Sebastian can hardly breathe.

SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
We all did..

Cut to:

We now see that Helmut is sitting inside the hut, just on
the other side of the wall. He has heard everything.

EXT. THE BEACH - MORNING 97
Carl is walking on the beach. He is carrying the same

backpack as he had in the beginning. He is now collecting

the black flags and putting them in the backpack.

Cut to:

EXT. GRAVEL ROAD - MEANWHILE 98
6 of the German boys are up by the road. They are loading

up a Danish military truck with a trailer with mines.
The driver helps out.

A lot of mines are being loaded. It is a pretty
overwhelming sight to behold.

EXT. FISHING HUT - MEANWHILE 99

Sebastian, Helmut, Ludvig and a forth German boy are
rolling up barbwire and depositing it in big piles ready
to be picked up.

Suddenly a giant explosion sounds from the road. Sebastian
and the others fall to the ground.

Cut to:
EXT. THE BEACH - CONTINUOUS 100

Carl who is still on the beach sees a giant cloud on smoke
rise from behind the dunes. He drops his backpack and
runs towards it.

EXT. FISHING HUT/ GRAVEL ROAD - CONTINUOUS 101

Sebastian, Helmut, Ludvig and a forth German boy get up.
They tun towards the road and the black cloud of smoke.
They sprint.

Sebastian and the boys stop ten meters away from the blast
site. They are shocked by what they see.

Carl comes running up to Sebastian and the boys. He stops
in his tracks. Flabbergasted.

All the mines on the truck have exploded. There are dead
bodies and loose body parts all over the place. The truck
has disintegrated except for its bent and blackened frame,
which is now burning.

Fade to black:
Cut to:
INT. FISHING HUT - MORNING 102

Sebastian, Helmut, Ludvig and a forth boy are packing up
their few belongings. They are the only four boys
remaining of the original 14.

There is a knock on the door. It is Karin holding
Elizabeth's hand.

Karin has brought a large basket with food and drinks.
She has a piece of paper in her hand. She reads from it
in German, slowly and with a strong Danish accent.

KARIN
I would like to thank you for all
that you have done. Thank you
for saving my daughter's life.

89.

The boys are just standing there. Karin sets the basket
down on the floor.

KARIN (CONT'D)
Thank you..

INT. ARMY TRUCK - MORNING 103

The boys are in the back of an army truck. Carl comes
over. He stands at the back of the truck. Looks in.

CARL
Best of luck.

The boys thank him. Sebastian and Carl look at each other.

The truck starts and drives off. Carl keeps looking at it
as the truck drives away.

INT. HQ BARRACKS - DAY 104
Later. Carl is walking quickly inside the HQ building

greeting a few people in passing. Evidently most of the

staff know him or know of him.

Carl stops in front of a young private.

CARL
Is he in?

PRIVATE
Yes. Go right through.

Carl goes through another door.

CARL
Lieutenant!

Ebbe is standing in front of the open window.

EBBE
Smell that.

Ebbe breathes in deeply through the nose.

EBBE (CONT'D)
Can you smell it? The smell of
Denmark, of spring and summer.
It is going to be a great year.
Don't you think?

Carl smiles.

CARL
Yeah, a great year.

EBBE
You are probably wondering why
you have been summoned?
90.

CARL
You can say that again.

EBBE
The reason that I am here, is
that we are going to need more
experienced men at Skallingen

CARL
Yeah? Okay. I can do that. But
I thought you wanted me in

Ringsted?

EBBE
Oh, I do. I wasn't talking about
you.

Carl doesn't understand.

CARL
Okay.. So what are you saying?

EBBE
We really need to reassign "your
German boys" down there. The
whole place is one big mess. All
the mines have shifted and they
need some skillful Germans with
experience. The men are dying by
the handfuls down there.

CARL
Yeah? Well, I wish I could help
you. But my unfortunately my
boys have already left.. They
have been shipped back to Germany
just this morning.

EBBE
Yeah, I heard.

CARL
Out of 14, 4 made it.

Clearly Ebbe couldn't care less.
EBBE
"Your" German boys are not on
their way home, Carl.

Carl doesn't understand.

CARL
Excuse me?
EBBE
Like I said, we really need their

experience.
(MORE )
91.

EBBE (CONT'D)
And that is why they have been
reassigned to Skallingen. Which
is where they will remain until
all the mines down there have
been cleared.

CARL
With all due respect, you promised
me that they would be allowed to
return home after clearing that
area. I made them a promise God
damn it! How does that make me
look. .?

Ebbe looks at Carl.

EBBE
There is nothing we can do about
it.

CARL

What are you talking about? When
was this decided? I was
specifically told that these boys
could return home after their job
was done!!

EBBE
Carl. This isn't just your boys.
All German soldiers still in the
country are retained until all
the mines are gone. And I mean
all.

Carl stands there a few moments.

CARL
God damn it, Ebbe.. I am asking
you as your friend. You and I
have been friends for how long?
I am begging you, just let those
four boys return home. Let them
go. They will die down there.

EBBE
Of course, you want them to go
home. I totally understand. But
unfortunately, the order has
already been carried out.

CARL
It is only four boys, God damn
itl!

EBBE

Now listen to me, Carl!

92.

EBBE (CONT'D)
I don't know what the fuck is
going on with you, but if I hear
one more word about those boys I
will personally go down to
Skallingen and shoot them myself.
You hear me?!!

Carl says nothing.

EBBE (CONT'D)
You think these are nice boys!
They are not. They have been
brainwashed by monsters from early
on! You have no idea what they
have done in the war!

Carl goes over and grabs hold of Ebbe's neck. Ebbe can't
breathe. Carl really squeezes hard. He looks Ebbe
straight in the eyes.

CARL
You lied to me.. I can tell just
by looking at you. You knew this
all along ... These boys are just
little boys, Ebbe. They cry out
for Mommy, when they are afraid,
or when their hands get blown
off. You understand? The tables
have turned. We are the monsters
now.

Carl lets go of Ebbe.
Carl turns around and leaves.
EXT. BARRACKS - LATER 105

Carl gets in the jeep. He is furious. He starts the
engine and drives off.

INT. CARL'S ROOM - DAY 106
Carl comes into his room. He sits down on his bed.

Carl pulls out a bottle of whisky from under his bed. He

opens the bottle and sits a while before he chugs from

the bottle.

He stares emptily into the air. We see his face.

He notices a little package on the table. He picks it up

and opens it. Inside is Sebastian's silver cross and a

note. The note says: "BOOM!"

EXT. OKSB@L CAMP / SKALLINGEN - DAY 107

Sebastian and the boys are now part of a new and much
larger platoon. They are standing to attention.
108

93.

An older Danish sergeant is standing in front of them.
All the other soldiers in the unit are older than
Sebastian, Helmut, Ludvig and the forth boy.

SERGEANT
Welcome to the Oksbgl Camp and
Skallingen! We have reason to
believe that roughly 72.000 mines
have been laid down here on
Skallingen. So this place is not
for sissies

He grins.

SERGEANT (CONT'D)
The reason I use the terms ‘reason
to believe' and 'roughly' is that
some of you have had the luxury
of having detailed mine maps at
your disposal... At Skallingen we
have no such maps!

The boys' faces have the look of betrayal written all
over them.

Zoom in on and CU of Sebastian. We stay with him for a
long time.

The sound fades down completely. We hear only Sebastian's
breathing.

Sebastian's POV. A soldier comes over to the sergeant.
He passes him a note. The sergeant looks irritated.

Cut to:
Sebastian wakes up when he is slapped in the face.
SERGENT

Sebastian Schumann!!? Do you

hear me? Report to the mess hall

on the double!
Sebastian re-focuses his attention. He looks over at
Ludvig, Helmut and the 4th boy, who have already stepped
out of the ranks.

SERGENT (CONT'D)
Get going. Now!

Sebastian goes over to the others. They leave.
EXT. MESS HALL SKALLINGEN - DAY 108
Sebastian and the others are heading to the mess hall. A

Danish soldier is there, behind a military truck. He
walks up them them.
94.

DANISH SOLDIER
Sebastian?

Sebastian and the boys stop.
DANISH SOLDIER (CONT'D)
Sebastian Schumann? Is that one
of you?

SEBASTIAN
Yes, it is me.

The soldier lifts aside the truck's tarpaulin.

DANISH SOLDIER
Get in..

Sebastian, Ludvig, Helmut and the forth boy are not sure
what is happening.

DANISH SOLDIER (CONT'D)

Come on, get in. We don't have

all day.
The boys climb into the back of the truck. They sit down.
The soldier closes the tarpaulin after them. He slams
the side of the truck with his hand. The truck starts up
and drives off.
Sebastian and the others look at each other, dumbfounded.
Cut to: (scene 108B)
Later. The truck stops. We hear the sound of the driver
opening the door, getting out and walking around to the
back of the truck. Ludvig looks nervously at Sebastian.
The tarpaulin is pulled aside. Carl appears.

CARL
Come on, get out.

The boys jump out. Carl points to the forest nearby.
CARL (CONT'D)
That way.. The border is a hundred
meters that way. Then you are in
Germany.
Sebastian looks at Carl. Carl looks back at him.

CARL (CONT'D)
Run..

Sebastian and the boys run across the field.

CU Sebastian stops and looks back at Carl.
Sebastian and the boys disappear into the forest.
Fade to black.

THE END
