EXT, SLAVE QUARTERS - FALCCNHURST PLANTATION - DAY 1

WARREN MAXWELL and BROWNLEE stroll slowly through the
compound oft primitive shacks. The slaves -- men,
women end children -- stand outside, summoned for
inspection, They look anxious, afraid of being sold.
Srownlee is a nervous, suspicious individual, mid-
forvies -- ready when necessary with insincere compli-
ments and wheedling flattery. Maxwell, late fifties,
rheumatic, testy and stubborn, is a man pleased with
himself and his achievements but not te the point of
smugness, He fancies himself decent and moral, a good
and kind master to his slaves.

As they walk, Erownlee's eyes dart from slave to slave,
appraising, evaluating. He stops from time to time to
squeeze a slave's muscle, poke or prod a belly or leg.
Maxwell watches silently, with some disdain. Brownlee
puts his hand on one black's shoulder, pushes him to
his knees, then wrenches the black's mouth open and
examines his teeth,

EROWNLEE :
You craves to sell him, Mista
Maxwell?

Maxwell shakes his head, ‘The black smiles, relieved.
Erownlee moves on, stops before three young blacks,

Brownlee turns to Cicero, inspects him. Cicero is tall,
powerfully built, with clear eyes and chiseled features,
about 24, There is a sense cf pride and a smouldering
defiance about him, Brownlee sees the letter R branded
into Cicero's back. Brownlee looks quizzically at
Maxwell,

Maxwell smiles, pleased with the price. Cicero,
stancing behind the two white men, smiles, too, glad
to be sold.

Tne house is a nine-room, clarboard structure <<
unimpressive for a plantation the size of Falconhurst,.
It is badly in need of paint and repair. Maxwell and
Erownlee are walking toward it wnen HAMMOND MAXWELL,
on horseback, rides up to the two men, dismounts. He
is an overly serious young man in his early twenties,
gentle, somewhat shy, He walks with a limp, his knee
permanently rigid. He greets his father with a kiss.

While Lazare goes on with his announcement, DeMarigny
takes a small phial containing a white powder from his
pocket. He hands it to Topaz who places it to his
nostrils and inhales deeply,

DeMARIGNY

TOPAZ

Hammond watches astounded, He turns anxiously to Red-
field,

REDFIELD
Don't worry. Make him wild at

Hammond glances nervously across the ring at Topaz, then
turns back to Mede,.

He puts his hand encouragingly on Mede's shoulder but
his eyes are heavy witn concern,

ANOTHER ANGIE
Hammond turns his gaze from the fighers to Redfield.

HAMMOND

That Topaz a seasoned fighter.
Mede cain't whup him noways...

ANOTHER ANGLE

Topaz dances around Mede, striking out with his long
arms, breaking through Mede's defense at will. Power-
ful blows smash into Mede's rigfit eye, making it swell.
More blows and Mede's lip splits, blood gushing down
his chin, Mede is urable to counter, He absorbs more
punches -~ it is not a fight but a flogging. The
spectators begin to jeer.

Now Topaz curses and taunts Mede as he pounds him, Then
Mede advances -~ making no attempt to protect himself
-~ ard delivers a mighty punch straight to the crucifix
tattoo in the center of Topaz's chest. Topaz staggers
cack, Mede follcws with another punch... and Topaz
crashes to the ground.

Mede leaps on top of Topaz. But Topaz extricates his
arns, claws at Mede's flesh, drawing blood -- and jumps
to his fset. Mede starts to rise but Topaz fells him
with a blow to the head.

The audience rears approval, Maxwell is bouncing up and
down in his chair with excitement, enjoying the fight,
seemingly unconcerned about Mede's plight. But Hammond
looks stricken, his hands clenched.

Mede reaches out, grabs Topaz's leg and brings him down.
Topaz tries to kick Mede in the groin <= but Mede rolls
away in time. Mede stumbles to his feet... plunges at
Tovaz, slamming his ‘mees into Topaz's face, Topaz
screams with pain, but locks his arms around Mede, pulls
him down ard sinks his teeth into Mede's ear lobe, half-
ripping it off, Then Topex crashes one devastating
blow after another into Mece's bleeding face.

Mede manages to wrap his arms around Topaz, momentarily
halting the punches, Panting, exhausted, the two
fighters roll. from side to side of the ring -~- forcing
Spectators to jump away to avoid them. Topaz jams his
elbows into Mede's kidneys and neck, shoves Mede's head
into the turf, . Ms

The end seems near for Mede., For a flash instant, he
catches sight of Hammond's anguished eyes and hears
Maxwell's voice,. . : :

Mede responds with e last superhuman effort -- a sledge-
. hammer blow to Topaz's temple == then falls back. Topaz
a. stays cn top of him, pinning him to the ground.

Lazare enters the ring to declare victory for Topaz.

But suddenly Mede flings his arms around Topaz, pulls
his body down tight egainst himself, his jaw working

against Topaz's neck, Topaz shrieks, chokes, and his
bedy shudders convulsively, his legs twitching, _

Lazare returns to his corner -- the fight is still on.
Seconds tick by... the pair lie still, Topaz on top.
lazare enters the ring again -- Topaz apparently the
victor, He pulls Topaz off Mede -- but Topaz is limp as
a rag doll, blood spurting from his neck, his jugular
vein severed, He is dead, :

Mede tries to rise but drops back into the dust. His
lips and teeth are stained with blood. Hammond rushes
up to him, incredulous.

As he passes his father, their eyes meet coldly --

inexorably, ritualistically to its fatal end.

Mede lunges forward with a terrible roar. Hammond FIRES

into the cauldron. Mede screams with pain, tries to
scramble out of the boiling water... But Hammond drops
