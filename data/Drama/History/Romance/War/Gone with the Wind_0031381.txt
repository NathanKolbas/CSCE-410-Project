and her breath is coming in spent, sobbing gasps. She runs
up those familiar steps, she goes to the front door and
starts to open it. It is locked. She knocks; and when
there is no answering sound or movement, she knocks: again--
more loudly and more loudly in a gathering crescendo of
hysteria until finally she is hammering frantically on the
door with both fists, screaming:

Scarlett

I’m home. Mother, let me in! It’s me--Scarlett!

Mother!
The door opens slowly, silently, and Gerald is there--in the
dark hallway. Scarlett, with both quivering hands upraised
where she has been pounding at the door, stares for a second
at his terribly changed face and. then throws herself
forward, clinging to him. Slowly, with a curious effect of
dazed fumbling, his arms go about her.

. Scarlett (AS CAMERA MOVES CLOSER)
Oh--oh, Pa! I’m home...I’m home...
Gerald, holding her in his arms, stares at her dazedly,
blinking heavily once or twice. He begins to tremble--"as
if he had been awakened from a nightmare into a half-sense
of reality. The eyes that looked into hers had ... a fear-
stunned look. He was only a little old man and broken"
