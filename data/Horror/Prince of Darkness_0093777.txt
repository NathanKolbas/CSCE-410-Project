MAIN TITLES BEGIN OVER BLACK, as we hear dark electronic
MUSIC -- baroque, classical, haunting...
2 EXT. SKY - MOON - NIGHT

The pale orb.
3 INT. SENTINEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

A tiny bedroom. Priest's. cell. Spare. Moody shadows from
the window. A large cross on the wall.

THE SENTINEL lies on a bed. He is an ancient old man. His
eyes flicker, cloud over... Slowly, he expires.

HIS HAND: as he dies, the Sentinel's hand siowly opens,
revealing an ornate black box -- sealed -- like a miniature
coffin, which slips between his lifeless fingers...
THE FLOOR: as the ornate box lands on the hard wood...

6 EXT. UNIVERISTY CAMPUS - DAY

An idyllic campus. Charming ivy-covered buildings. STUDENTS
stroll the grounds. PAN WITH a PRETTY CO-ED on a bicycle *
to REVEAL:

BRIAN MARSH, 24, a graduate student in physics, newly
arrived on campus, walks down a sunlit courtyard carrying
ah -armload of’ textbooks. He glances over...

BRIAN'S POV: near a fountain. CATHERINE MIDWOOD, 24, talks
with another FEMALE GRADUATE STUDENT. They seem to be
telling each other jokes, laughing. Catherine is pretty.
Open. Intelligent. Tomboyish, in a way.

CLOSE ON Brian as he slows, watches...

HIS POV: Catherine walking away with her friend...

And Brian can't resist looking over his shoulder at this
beautiful girl as he enters 'The Feynman Institute of

oe Physics'...

BLACK SCREEN. Continue MAIN TITLES.
INT. SENTINEL'S BEDROOM - DAY

The door opens an a NUN, 50s, appears. She steps inside
the tiny cell...

HER POV: the Sentinel lying still as death in his bed...

The Nun says something m.o.s., gets no response. Then she
looks down...

HER POV: that ornate box lying on the floor...

AN HOUR LATER: THE PRIEST, 50s, leans over a small table
in the corner of the Sentinel's room. He is a strong-
willed man, his eyes direct, humorless. In b.g. the Nun
watches as the priest reads...

PRIEST'S POV: an old weatherbeaten notebook. At the top
of the yellowed page is written: “Brotherhood of Sleep".

The priest reads on, his brow furrowing...

PRIEST'S POV: EXTREME CLOSE-UP. In the middle of a page
of handwriting, see the phrases: "...the sleeper wakes..."
and, right below, "...can no longer keep..."

EXT. UNIVERSITY - DAY

PROFESSOR HOWARD DIRAC, 50s, a theoretical physicist, walks
across campus carrying his briefcase. Dirac is of Chinese
ancestry, a determined-looking man. He glances around at
the students going to their classes...

LOW ANGLE: we see Dirac walking toward the physics building
in b.g. In f£.g.-is a mound of grass, and under the bright
green grass and leaves see thousands of ants scurrying

madly...

Dirac stops at the entrance to the physics building. He
glances up into the morning sky...

DIRAC'S POV: a strange alignment in the early morning sky.
The moon is visible directly above the sun... [EFFECT]

BLACK SCREEN. More TITLES.
EXT. DIOCESE GROUNDS - DAY
A beautiful expanse. Trees. Green lawns. The priest

shakes hands with a BISHOP and ARCHBISHOP, two berobed
luminaries of the Roman Catholic Church.

CONTINUED:

The three men talk m.o.s. Out of doors, on the quiet
grounds, it's private here, somehow -- among the flowers.
They are serious. Intent. Out of his pocket the priest
brings something to show them...

THE PRIEST'S HAND: the ornate box. He opens it, and inside
is a large silver key...

BLACK SCREEN. Continue MAIN TITLES.
INT. LECTURE HALL - DAY

Professor Dirac is lecturing to a graduate physics class.
The class is small. The brightest of the bright. There's
WALTER, 30s, Chinese. KELLY, 20s, pretty and outgoing.
MULLINS, 30s. FIVE OTHER STUDENTS listen, take notes...

DIRAC
Let's talk about our beliefs
and what we can learn about
them... We believe nature is
solid and time is constant.
Matter has substance, time a
direction. There is truth in
flesh and solid ground. The
wind may be invisible, but it's
real. Smoke and fire, water
and light -- they're different,
not as stone nor steel, but
they're tangible...

Now we see Brian sitting near the back, not paying all that
much attention to the lecture, looking at:

BRIAN'S POV: Catherine, sitting a few rows in front. She
listens attentively, taking notes...

Brian does stare somewhat dreamily at her...

DIRAC
And we assume time has an
arrow. It is as a clock --
one second is one second for
_everyone. Cause precedes
effect. Fruit rots, water
flows downstream, we're born,
we age, we die. The reverse
never happens.

A beat as Dirac pauses, a slight smile...

DIRAC
None of this is true. Say
goodbye to classical reality,
because our logic collapses
on the subatomic level -- into
ghosts and shadows...

EXT. ABANDONED CHURCH - DAY

The priest stands in front of a huge abandoned church
somewhere in Los Angeles. It is immense. Gothic. Its
spires sweep upward into the sky.

The priest looks at the old abandoned church with a sense
of unease...

INT. ABANDONED CHURCH - REAR HALLWAY - DAY

A large, dusty hallway. The priest walks slowly along.
His FOOTSTEPS ECHO. It's eerie. in here, the sunlight
drifting in large, high windows.

Now the priest stops at a huge iron door. Extremely old.
Mammoth. It looks bomb-proof, earthquake-proof, other Acts-
of-God proof...

The priest pauses a moment by the iron door. Then he takes
out that ornate box, removes the key, inserts it in the lock.

BLACK SCREEN - More TITLES.

EXT. CAMPUS - NIGHT

Brian walks along. He slows, looks over...

BRIAN'S -POV:. Catherine enters the university book store.

Brian stops. Glances at his watch. Parks himself by a
bench to wait. He looks up...

BRIAN'S POV: the night sky. Huge full moon. Leaves of a
nearby tree swish silently in f.g. [EFFECT}

Brian now looks over...

BRIAN'S POV: Catherine comes out of the book store with a
HANDSOME MAN, 27. They laugh and talk. He could be a
student, a teacher, athlete , who knows? Hard to tell if
they're just friends or on a more intimate basis...

Brian. He looks somewhat disappointed. But he's not sure
either...

INT. PRIEST'S ROOM - NIGHT

The priest is writing at a table-top computer. He is
tense, driven. He finishes typing, punches a couple
buttons, and the printer begins CLACKING madly as it types
out what he's written...

PRIEST'S POV: the printer. An address CLICKS across the
page: "Professor Howard Dirac, Feynman Institute of Physics..."

CLOSE ON the priest: he has a distant expression.

EXTREME CLOSE-UP: the paper, as the printing element SNAPS
across: "...of the utmost urgency..."

BLACK SCREEN. TITLES.
INT. LECTURE HALL ~- DAY
Dirac is lecturing again...

DIRAC
From Job's friends insisting
that the good are rewarded and
the wicked punished, down to
scientists in the 1930s proving,
to their horror, a theorem that
not everything can be proved,
we've sought to impose order on
the universe...

Brian's not paying attention during this lecture either.
He. looks at...

BRIAN'S POV: Catherine, who listens interestedly...

DIRAC
But we've found something very
surprising. While order does
exist in the universe, it is
not at all what we had in mind...

Now Brian glances over at the windows letting in that warm,
California sunlight...

BRIAN'S POV: a black limousine pulls up in front of the
physics building. It's ominous somehow, that big black
car against the verdant green of the campus...

Brian exits

BRIAN'S POV: Catherine walking away down the hall...

Brian. He's definitely in love.

the Mother Superior hands Dirac a sealed envelope...

Brian, as Waiter drifts over to him...

WALTER
(sotto voce)
What's this?

BRIAN

I don't know. Dirac did that
series of debates on the B.B.C.

a few years ago...

WALTER

Oh, with the priest, right...

BRIAN

Maybe they're planning another

one...
BLACK SCREEN. MORE TITLES.
EXT. SPANISH MISSION - DAY

A car pulls up in front. of a California Spanish mission.
Dirac emerges from the car. Walks up some steps into a

portico. Looks off...

DIRAC'S POV: a group of NUNS walking, their robes billowed
by the wind, their habits fluttering...

Behind Dirac the priest walks out of the mission, comes
up to him. They shake hands, talk m.o.s. They seem
happy to see each other, renewing an old acquaintance.

INT. MISSION - ORNATE SANCTUARY - DAY

Dirac and the priest enter an ornate sanctuary inside the
mission. They move away from CAMERA and now the priest
tells Dirac something m.o.s. We don't hear, but Dirac is
absolutely stunned by what the priest is saying. Alarmed.
Then nonplussed.

+e te

CLOSER ANGLE, to hear...

PRIEST
He died before his appointment
with the Cardinal -- but he
left a diary...

The priest hands Dirac the notebook...

PRIEST
You've got to help us...
Please.

Dirac searches the priest's expression, finds only fear...
BLACK SCREEN. TITLES.
INT. BRIAN'S APARTMENT ~- NIGHT

Spartan. Spare. Lots of books stacked around. A messy
bed. Brian sits at a desk, shuffling a deck of cards. He's
practicing a magic trick, making a card disappear in his
hand. | But he's bad at it, and the card keeps dropping out
onthe desk. Frustrated, he glances up now at an old TV
set with its sound turned down...

BRIAN'S POV: TV. The news is on and the ANCHOR is talking
m.0.8. SUPERIMPOSED OVER is the legend: "NEW DISCOVERY".

Then we see a photograph of a distant galaxy, and we ZOOM

IN on a glowing, exploding star -- a supernova...

SHOOTING OVER THE TV on Brian as he comes up to the set,
turns up the sound, returns to the desk...

EXT. ABANDONED CHURCH - DAY

as Dirac and the priest step from a limousine and walk
to the old crumbling church...

INT. ABANDONED CHURCH - FRONT HALLWAY - DAY

The priest and Dirac step in to the dilapidated front hall,

move past some stairs to a hallway...
INT. REAR HALLWAY

They come to that massive iron door. The priest inserts
the silver key...

INT. CRUMBLING STAIRWAY - DAY

+.+ and the iron door swings open on to a long stone stair-
way that leads downward. There are no windows in here. The
priest turns on a flashlight and leads Dirac down...

INT. CRUMBLING HALLWAY - DAY

They come off the stairway into an old, crumbling hallway.
Unlike the church upstairs, it resembles some ornate old
catacombs. CAMERA MOVES WITH them down the hall...

DIRAC
Who knew about this?

PRIEST
Only members of this forgotten
sect. The Brotherhood of
Sleep.

INT. DANK CORRIDOR - STRANGE HALLWAY - DAY

Now they move down a dank corridor. Dark. Water drips
from above. The priest's flashlight beam spins around
the walls. They seem to be going deeper and deeper...

PRIEST
This was built in the 1500s.
The altar was moved here from
England. Before England, it was
in Rome...

DIRAC
The Vatican didn't know?

PRIEST
The guardian priest would keep
the secret, and before he
died would pass it on to
another...

They turn a corner... into a strange hallway. There are
crosses on the stone walls. Everywhere. The small hall

s wet, ancient. Dirac and the priest stop, and CAMERA
MOVES IN, PANS, and we see they are standing in a mezzanine
over looking a huge underground church built deep in the
bowels of the earth under the abandoned church above...
Now see something glowing in the apse -- a weird yellow
glow... It's a container of some kind...

BLACK SCREEN. Final TITLE.

INT... UNDERGROUND CHURCH =~ DAY

Dirac and the priest enter the underground church. It is
moist, dripping in here. There are literally hundreds of
crosses everywhere -- on the walls, on stanchions, on the
floor. The priest lights a few candles. Dirac is clearly
stunned. They start down the aisle toward the front,
CAMERA MOVING WITH THEM. Dirac stares ahead. The priest
looks anxious, almost frightened...

CONTINUED:

DIRAC'S POV: we MOVE TOWARD a large transparent canister
of liguid in the apse. All the crosses seem to point
toward this canister as if some sort of evil were being
held at bay. It is sealed with a heavy, screw-on lid.
It looks vastly old.

Dirac and the priest walk, the flashlight beam spinning,
staring...

DIRAC'S POV: MOVE IN CLOSE on the canister. The mold and
corrosion on the top and bottom of the canister look pre-
historic. Inside the sealed compartment there is a weird
water dance -- the liquid, a faint yellowish color, glows
and swirls -- somehow alive!

Dirac and the priest stop in front of the canister. The
priest lights several candles. Below the canister is an
1d book on a podium. The priest carefully opens the book,
shines the flashlight on its yellowed pages...

DIRAC
Latin.

PRIEST
The original text has been
distorted through the years...

DIRAC
Distorted?

PRIEST
Rewritten. Changed.

Dirac leans forward, gingerly examines the book...

PRIEST
It's been written on two or
three times and improperly
erased. You see -~ the
original text is still
visible -- underneath.

Dirac looks back up at the strangely glowing canister. The
priest stares at it, too. There's an unmistakable look on
their faces -- dread, fear...

PRIEST
Can you feel it?

DIRAC
Yes... Something...

(CONTINUED)
ll.

35 CONTINUED:

PRIEST
It was never there before.
It started a month ago...

DIRAC
What started?

PRIEST
A change -~ in the earth and
sky... His power...

36 EXT. UNIVERSITY CAMPUS - DAY

Catherine and Walter walk together on their way to class.
CAMERA MOVES ALONG with them...

WALTER
I don't get it.

CATHERINE
What don't you get?

WALTER
The whole thing. It doesn't
make sense.

CATHERINE
It violates common sense, that's
the whole point. That's what
Einstein couldn't accept.

WALTER
I can't accept it either.
(beat)
Do you know anything about
Spontaneous Human Combustion?

CATHERINE
Walter, come on... Schrodinger's
Cat...

WALTER

CATHERINE

So, what's the point? The
point is, until the cat is
observed by someone, he is not
in any definite state, alive
or dead. He is in a wave
superposition state, both dead
and alive at the same time...

WALTER
Huh?

CATHERINE
Only when we open the box and
observe the cat does he material-
ize into reality, either dead
or alive...

WALTER
But it doesn't make sense...

CATHERINE
That's the entire, complete
point. It doesn't make any
common sense, our common sense
breaks down on the subatomic
level.

WALTER
Why do I want a Ph.D. in this?

CATHERINE
Particle beam weapons, research
grants...

WALTER
A-millionaire when I'm 40 --
now I remember...

INT. HALLWAY - PHYSICS BUILDING - DAY

Catherine and Walter walk down the hall...

CATHERINE'S POV: MOVING SHOT of Brian leaning against the
wall opposite the door to the lecture room. He's looking
back at her. Only two of the other students from Dirac's
class are here ~- Kelly and Mullins...

Catherine smiles at Brian as she and Walter stop at the
lecture hall door, stare at a note taped there...

MULLINS
You're not going to like
it...
THEIR POV: the note: “CLASS CANCELLED. THE FOLLOWING
STUDENTS SEE PROF. DIRAC..." A list of names follows.
WALTER

'The following students...'
Shit, there I am...

CATHERINE
Me too...

BRIAN
I hear Dirac wants us to
cancel our plans for the

weekend...
WALTER
(horrified)
What? .
KELLY

That's not all... A couple
of Biochemistry's finest are
coming with us...

 

MULLINS
And someone to translate Latin...

CATHERINE
Coming with us where?

Nobody knows... As Walter turns and walks moodily away...

WALTER
I'm going to have to pull
some strings, here, this is
just not gonna happen. I
have serious plans for the

weekend...
KELLY
Four o'clock, Walter. Dirac's
office...

‘ others)

I'll have to ditch Pagels again,

Now Mullins drifts away too, as Brian smiles at Catherine.

BRIAN
So what about your plans?

CATHERINE
I was going to study, actually.

BRIAN
(relieved)
Yeah, me too... I'm Brian Marsh,
by the way, since we're spending
the weekend together...

CATHERINE
I know. Catherine Midwood.

 

BRIAN
I know.

38 EXT. CAMPUS - DAY

as Brian and Catherine walk along, CAMERA DRIFTING WITH
them...

CATHERINE
Where did you transfer from?

. BRIAN
Kneale. Theoretical Physics.
I came here to study with
Dirac. You're Applied Physics?
(she nods)
So why are you taking Dirac
for theory?

CATHERINE
I want to tknow what the math
means.

BRIAN
Dirac's ruthless. He wants
e philosophers, not scientists.

EXT. CAMPUS COURTYARD - DAY

They sit in a beautiful courtyard outside the Philosophy
building...

CATHERINE
Sounds mystical, doesn't it?
Observer-created reality.

BRIAN
I started solving differential
equations when I was a sophomore.
At first it was just an exercise.
Solve the math, no big deal.
But then when I started to think
about what all this math implied...
Strange way to find out things
aren't the way I thought they
were...

. CATHERINE
Sometimes just as I think I've
got it, visualized it -- it all
goes away. I start seeing
old-fashioned classical reality.
I want the clockwork back. I
want to put it all into a
little box, but whenever I try,
it slithers out...

Brian reaches in his pocket, comes out with his deck of
cards...

BRIAN
Some things aren't changed by
quantum physics...

CATHERINE
Such as?

BRIAN
Every theoretical physicist I
know wonders why nobody who looks
like you seems to ever settle
down in our end of the building...

That's not true and that's an
extremely sexist thing to say.

BRIAN
Confirmed sexist. Proud of it.
(but now he sees
that a wall has gone
up around her)
Hey, wait... I'm just teasing
you...

Brian tries to do the card trick. He screws it up again,
the cards falling to the ground. He hopes she'll laugh.
She doesn't.

BRIAN
What's the deal? You talk
numbers, you get romantic. You
talk people, you clam up.

Catherine's jaw locks. She's tense and guarded, and yet
she smiles. It's a social amenity she obviously doesn't
feel...

CATHERINE
Just a little miscue, that's
all. It's not your fault. I'm
sorry. I'11 see you later...

BRIAN
Look, this conversation is not
what I had in mind at all. Can
we just try this all again?

Catherine looks at him, then relaxes, smiles...

CATHERINE
Okay...

BRIAN
You see, I was hoping you
needed more help with theory.
So we could discuss it --
maybe over dinner or something,
say...

CATHERINE

front of Dirac...

DIRAC

I have volunteered our
services to the archdiocese.
Each of you is a competant
physicist, even though you
don't have a degree to prove
it.

(glances at

Walter)
Participating in this
examination will greatly
improve your classroom
averages, I might add.

 

Walter looks sheepish...

DIRAC
Plan on eating your meals
there. We'll bring cots
to sleep on. There are
other departments joining us...

BRIAN
‘Excuse me, sir. Is there a
reason why you're not telling
us what we're going to be

doing?

DIRAC'S POV: down the street. A bus stop. A BAG LADY

is seated, rigid, a petrified Pompeiian mummy with a mask-
like face. Her shopping cart full of yellowing newspapers
and broken appliances sits nearby...

Dirac, as he looks closer...

CLOSER: the bag lady. She lifts her right arm slightly,
from the elbow, in a strange salute -- and begins slowly
rocking her head back and forth, over and over again...

EXTREME CLOSE: across the dirty flesh of her cheek crawl
a few ants...

EXT. CITY SKYLINE - NIGHT

LONG LENS. The moon is squashed, compressed and enlarged,
hanging dead in the night sky behind the Los Angeles sky-

INT. OFFICE - ABANDONED CHURCH - NIGHT

Dirac and the priest sit in an old office in the abandoned
church. Dirac has a cot set up in here, his clothes hang-
ing out of the suitcase. It's dark, damp -- only low
light from a couple lamps...

PRIEST
It your disbelief that
powers him. It's your stubborn
faith in common sense that
allows his deception...

It's hard to tell from Dirac's expression whether or not
he fully believes all the priest is telling him.

PRIEST
He lives in the smallest
parts of it. The atoms.
Smaller. Invisible. He
lives in all of it, the
sum of the parts...

you've already managed that
for two thousand years...

PRIEST
No prison can keep him now.

EXT. CAMPUS - NIGHT

Catherine comes out of the physics building, leaving from
a late class. Brian is waiting outside for her...

CATHERINE
Hi.
BRIAN

Maybe you'd have a cup of

untangles himself from Catherine's arms and gets out of
bed without waking her...

EXT. BRIAN'S APARTMENT ~- DAY

Brian emerges from his small apartment bungalow into the
cold morning air. He glances off thoughtfully, filled with
excitement, going through his feelings... He looks up...

Brian has made them both coffee... .

BRIAN
Good morning.

She smiles at him sleepily.

CATHERINE
We didn't get much sleep...

BRIAN
Who needs sleep?

CATHERINE
We. do. Today's Friday.

Brian comes over to her, kisses her tenderly...

BRIAN

A friend of mine at UCLA did

book of Latin are on the other. Lisa stands indicating
various parts of the original text...

A long pause. Walter leans over to Brian, whispers...

Something like this can really

CATHERINE
How did the Roman Catholic Church

The priest looks terrible -- like he wants to die...

made... to characterize pure *

evil as a spirtual force. Evil

Brian's face -- as he looks over his shoulder -- making
sure they're alone...

BRIAN
Some kind of power. Directed
outward. A controlled force...

CATHERINE
What is it doing?

BRIAN
Reaching out. Influencing,
changing things. Moving
objects by thought.

This stuns Catherine. She just stares at him.

INT. DIRAC'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Dirac and the priest. Alone now. The priest looks
completely exhausted. But Dirac looks strong, somehow.

DIRAC
Suppose what your faith has
said was essentially correct...

The priest looks at him...

DIRAC
Suppose you have a universal
mind controlling everything --
a God willing the behavior of
every subatomic particle. Any
individual particle still appears
to be random, mind you -=- but if
you look at the collective
behavior of vast numbers of
atoms -- then you see organization.

PRIEST
I don't understand.

DIRAC
A search for order. Isn't that
what we want to find? A structure.
To prove we're in benevolent
hands...

Dirac picks up a thick, bound stack of computer-printed
pages: the translation. He opens it to a marked page...

DIRAC

This diety, the Father of
Satan... The literal trans-
lation from Latin is 'Anti-
God'...

page)
Every particle has an anti-
particle, its mirror image,

its negative.

As Wyndham, looking disgusted and contemptuous, turns and
walks away toward a rear alley. He stops, turns back to
the church, stares for a moment...

WYNDHAM
Ca-ca.

WYNDHAM'S POV: a window on the first floor. We can see just
@ shape in there, a figure standing at the window watching
him...

Wyndham strains, tries to see who it is more clearly...

WYNDHAM'S POV: CLOSER on the window. Still just a dark
shape...

CLOSE: Wyndham, as his expression changes now...

WYNDHAM'S POV: around the edge of the window, there's some
movement. We see black beetles crawling! Inside the window

we can see it is Susan standing there watching him, a
neutral expression on her face...

CLOSE: Wyndham. He stares, chilled, then turns to leave.
WYNDHAM'S POV: the back alley. Standing there in the dark

are at least 20 STREET PEOPLE -- ragged, crazy, in silhouette,
motionless -- all watching him!

 

Wyndham takes a step back, his feet CRUNCHING on something.
He looks down...

HIS FEET: all around his shoes are hordes of black beetles
on the sidewalk!

HIS PANTS LEG: more beetles crawl up the fabric!

 

HIS HAND: a beetle scampers right across his knuckle!

running, up the sidewalk right toward Wyndham...

A FLASH as the figure passes CAMERA -- tattered, frenzied,
her eyes wild, it is the Bag Lady we saw earlier, and as
she passes she pulls out an evil-looking metal shiv!

 

She rushes up to Wyndham, raises the shiv, plunges it into
his shoulder!

QUICK, FRENZIED FLASHES, allowing us not to see the actual
blade impacts, only a violent visual suggestion -- as the
Bag Lady lifts the shiv and plunges it again and again,
into the back of his neck, his shoulders -- a wild paroxysm
of slashing fury!

CLOSE: the window, as Susan watches silently, emotion-
lessly...

CLOSE, QUICK CUTS: Wyndham tries to fend off the blows,
but he's weakening. He is slashed all over...

WIDE SHOT: Wyndham finally falls down to the sidewalk. The
Bag Lady steps back from him now as he crawls slowly along
the grass, barely pulling himself forward, and finally rolls
into some bushes. HOLD THE SHOT. The Street People are
like statues. The Bag Lady walks slowly back to them. Now
the bushes stop moving. It's quiet now. Wind WHISHING in
the alley.

He's deep in thought -- as Catherine hands the sheet of ‘
1 figures to Walter...

DIRAC
What if these dreams, pre-
monitions, omens -- what if
they're really visual messages
sent by human beings? Photo-
graphs, video signals...

   

LOMAX
From where?

CATHERINE
The future. Anything traveling
faster than light would appear
to be going backward in time.

BRIAN
A future scientist calculates
the exact spot the earth occupied
in space -- in the past, based
on speed, trajectory... He beams
a tachyon signal at that spot,
transmits video information
backward in time...

CATHERINE
++. For us to receive as
electrical impulses -- neural
stimulus...

WALTER
{looking at the
figures)
Man oh man...

LEAHY
For what purpose?

BRIAN
Could be to warn us -- to show
us what's coming. A remote
camera view of the future -- so
we can change it.

And suddenly Brian performs the card trick perfectly. The
card disappears...

BRIAN
Someone finally showed up to
tell us -- it's time to stand
up for what we are.

Walter turns ‘to one of the monitoring devices nearby, as it
makes a soft BEEPING... He stares at the readout, taps it
a couple times.

WALTER
I think there's something
wrong with this, I'm not
getting anything now...

Catherine ‘sits. near the window glowing with light from the
setting sun. She looks tired, worn. Lomax is nearby,
huddled in the corner, asleep. Dirac's leaning against a
wall.

Brian digs away at the wall with the leg brace. Finally
he stops , sags against the wall in exhaustion. He looks
over...

Dirac. The light from the setting sun makes a soft,
luminous glow on his face. He's looking at the window...

Worker ants, driven to a

to the individual. The
street people, our collegues --
all controlled...

BRIAN
Demonic possession...

DIRAC
Of a kind... Not what we
would expect, though. Never
that.

CATHERINE
Why would he need us? The
book says his purpose is to
bring the Father back from
the darkside, wherever that
is.

DIRAC
There could be a limit to what
he can do -- as just a volume
of liquid. He controls simple
organisms easily. But maybe
he needs something more complex
to complete a life cycle... A
host in which to live...

Now Dirac has joined Brian and Catherine by the hole. They
listen to Walter...

WALTER

(distantly)
The swelling's gone down, as
if the liquid was absorbed
into her system... I can see
tissue changes on her face...
Also I think her bone structure
is changing...

CATHERINE
Changing into what?

WALTER -
(distantly)
I don't know, but you wouldn't
want to take her to meet your
parents...

DIRAC
Maybe that’s the only way he
can actualize his power -~ a
parasite growing into its
host... This could be some
kind of gestation period...

CATHERINE
I knew I'd seen it before!
Kelly had a mark -- a bruise...
Almost like a figure... I saw
it in a history book. The
astrologer's staff -- used in
ritual magic in the middle ages.

DIRAC
The mark was on her?

CLOSE: the priest. Now he begins to read the Roman Ritual
aloud, but very, very softly. Whispering an exorcism...

PRIEST

God and Father of our Lord
Jesus Christ...

CLOSE: Calder. Either he doesn't hear -- or doesn't
recognize the words the priest speaks. He may hear them,
but they have nothing to do with the will inside him that
