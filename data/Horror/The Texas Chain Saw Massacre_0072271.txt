a low, crackling nolse. The sun begins to disolve and to

Flies swarm tne staring eye and the crackling nolse
becomes the buzzing of the flies.

In the extreme foreground and to the right of center
is tne long dead and putrid carcass of a dog. The
lower jaw, nearly ripped from the head, hangs wildly
aakew. The belly is a living, writhing mass of grey
Maggots;:flies swarm the purple, glazed eyes... The
sercass lies some feet from the shoulder of a narror,

and the brutal southwestern sun blasts the dusty,.
chocking landscape. The air is sttil and neavy..

In the background is the out of focus trage of a van..

The hitchiker becomes more andmore-alert as he watches Pranklins
he begins to grind his teeth audinly.. Pam notices-and calls:
Kirks attention to it; he shrugs. Theres is snough engine noise:
that Jerry and Sally do not hear. On one or two occasions it
seems as if the hitehiker is going to reach for the knife but

he visibly restrains himself,.

The conversation interrupts Franklin and he momentarily
slackens his fren,ied toying with the. switchdlades. The
nitechiker suddenly and deftly takes the switchblade from his
hands. Pam gasps3: Kirk watches warily but in silence. .The
hitehiker ts oblivious to then.. Jerry and Sally are -unaware
of the situation.. Franklin,. startled, watches with intense
curiosity.. The hitohiker examines the knife carefully, closes
its blade, further examines the fnife,. presses-its spring
button and the blade springs open, examines“it still further
and then very slowly and deliverately puts the blade against
the fleshy part of his hand'below the thumb and seems about
to test its sharpness but instead presses the blade deliberately;
inte his flesh.. Franklin 1s awed,,.Pam horrified and Kirk
disgusted.

from the table and approaches, Sally begins to struggle
and scream as best she is able though she is~securely
bound and gagged. Leatherface speaks to her in a
reassuring tone and strokes her hair then cuts-the ropes
that bind the arm held by the hitchiker,. turns her

hee palm up and quickly and expertly cuts deeply into
the tip of her index finser. Sally struggles violently
on the verge of fatnting but is firmly held by the
hitchiker. Leatherface Lifts her hand. and with the
hitchikers assistance they force 1t into the grand-
fathers mouth, Leatherface must open the slack toothe

finger is in his mouth the srandfather begins to suckle

life and begin to squirm. He buts-Sallys finger with
