“THE ’ OMEN"
FADE IN
EXT, THE NIGHT SKY i

Silent. Peaceful. The constellations SEEN clearly,
quilted against blue, interwoven with the Milky Way.

From the infinite depths of the Universe, imperceptibly

at first, we begin to HEAR a SOUND. It is a CHANT. Unison
and resounding. Distant.-- slowly growing in volume --

a thousand human voices repeating the "QHM" until it fills
the atmosphere, and we begin td SENSE MOVEMENT in the STARS.

SUPER: IN WHITE, BIBLICAL SCRIPTURE:
"Tet ‘He whe hath understanding
Reckon the number of the Beast}
For 4t is e human number;
Its number is Six Hundred and Sixty-Six"
SUPER FADES: And the chant begins to rise in
volume, the constellations begin to shudder, as a new STAR
slowly forms in their midst,
SUPER: IN WHITE, BIBLICAL SCRIPTURE:

-- CHAPTER TWELVE
VERSE TWENTY-EIGHT --

SUPER FADES: As the chant increases in volume,
and the star takes sudden shape; fire at its center, a halo
of black surrounded by white.

robe -~ with one hand he forces the robe into the dog's mouth,

CLOSE ANGLE ON THORN'S HAND 667
fumbling with a leather-bound tool kit.
ANGLE ON THE Dog's HEAD 668

as Thorn's hand enters the FRAME and smashes the screwdriver
directly between his eyes. Thorn's hand straining to push it
right down to the hilt: the animal's mouth flying open, the
blanket falling free as it emits a Yroar of pain, more like a
leopard than a dog.

with a black veil, a child held firmly in her arms.

CAMERA CONTINUES TO TIGHTEN 708
