No. It’s new. Vastly different themes.

It’s an iteration. No originality. No
courage. My opinion.

CLOUDIO
Well I absolutely respect the power of
your point of view but this encompasses a
global scale. There’s just such a sense
of now and in-your-face that speaks to
pop and cinema and economics. I mean you
can feel the winds of the apocalypse.

JON DONDON
I’m not honestly sure. I can tell you
we're oversold by 600 percent.

Morf love.

(re: the SURFING GROTESQUE)
We bid on it for the museum. Jon wants
3.7. Rhodora won’t sell a Piers for
under five so this is an opportunity for
us. I’m quite curious to know what you
think

MORF
I think sober hasn’t been good for him.

GRETCHEN
This was done four years ago. Piers was
in the full bloom of alcoholism here.

MORF
Exactly.

GRETCHEN
So you’re saying this would be a good buy
for the museum then?

MORF sees JOSEPHINA navigating the CROWD with her coffees ...

Excuse me.

Hey, are you okay?

JOSEPHINA
Literally the worst fucking day.

MORF
(re: the exhibition/gallery)
Color. Life. I love it.

RHODORA
I’m sick of white spaces.

MORF
That’s so strange. I’ve been completely
drawn to bohemian lately.

RHODORA
This adherence to showing in sterile,
monochrome cubes. It’s just laziness. I
wanted to get some juxtaposition going.
MORF
I’m actually I mean right now writing
something exactly about this.
(ze: the MIRRORED SPHERE)
This wasn’t in the catalogue.

RHODORA
It’s Minkins.

MORF watches VIEWERS tentatively insert their hands and arms
deep into the many holes dotting the large MIRRORED SPHERE ...
some SMILE at what they feel ... some RECOIL ...

RHODORA
It creates a unique sensation depending
on each person and whatever hole they
decide to explore. Just like life. It
uses all sorts of sensors and gizmos.
It’s about choice, desire, sex, the whole
enchilada.

MORE
It’s ground-breaking.

RHODORA
It’s yours to break. It debuted 10
minutes ago.

MORE
I’m posting a review. How much is it?

RHODORA
It’s so much easier to talk about money
than art.

MORF
Funny. Speaking of, is Piers leaving you
for Jon Dondon?

RHODORA
I've represented Piers for seventeen
years.

That’s not an answer.

RHODORA
Why don’t you put your hand in and see
what you feel.

CLOUDIO
Hoboman’s still available. It would be
absolutely perfect for your new wing.

We blew our budget buying the Piers.

CLOUDIO
In that case I have the perfect ad line
for your next brochure. Be prepared to
see what you’ve seen before.

GRETCHEN
Regarding what exactly?

CLOUDIO
You're taking a great museum and filling
it with brands. Your job as curator is
to challenge, not preserve status quo.

You’re peddling a Wolfson knock-off and
lecturing me on playing it safe?

to a young, bearded, SIKH (DAMRISH) ...

RHODORA
Your website doesn’t give a sense of
scale or texture but seeing your work for
the first time today at the new artists
fair I had that oh-my-God moment. It
charges. It mauls. It devours.

DAMRISH
Six months ago I was living on the
street, showing on sidewalks. So that’s
where I’m coming from. Screw spectacle.
I’m about asking tough questions.

REODORA
Well lemme fill you in. All of this is
just a safari to hunt the next new thing
and eat it.

DAMRISH
I heard you’re the one to watch out for.

RHODORA
Oh I’m easy-peasy and a pussy cat really.
You’re laughing. See, I’m funny too.

DAMRISH
I know all about you. Going back to your
punk days.

RHODORA
That was many moons ago.

DAMRISH
Velvet Buzzsaw.

RHODORA
Well the name was catchy.

DAMRISH
The early stuff was great. Then it
became what? Self-parody? I mean after
Polly left.

RHODORA
You are informed. It was Polly and me
writing the songs so it lost something
when she went her own way.

DAMRISH
Why'd you split up?

RHODORA
Who remembers through all the booze and
the pills? The point is I’ve gone from
anarchist to purveyor of good taste, so I
get the joke. None of this is new. It’s
all been done since someone charged a
bone to see the first cave painting.

RHODORA takes two shots from a passing waiter ... hands one to
DAMRISH ... clinks ... both downing their drinks ...
RHODORA
So what cave are you showing in?
DAMRISH
Me and my dudes started a collective.
RHODORA
Good, you're staying in L.A. then.
DAMRISH
All the way.
RHODORA

Well hell knows I love loyalty but I’d
kill to exhibit you. I can guide you

through the bullshit and shennanigans,
help you create your own art position.
11.

DAMRISH
My position’s anti-market.

RHODORA
Hey I put the r into risky shit. I live
for art with some fucking soul.

DAMRiSH
I just turned down an offer for a full
show from Jon Dondon.

RHODORA
And on and on. He’s inside right now
trying to poach Piers. Know where I am,
Damrish? I’m here doing shots with you.

JON DONDON
Rhodora over-priced you. She’s lost it,
completely out of touch. I sold Surfer
Girl today for 3.7 million, exactly what
I said I’d get. If you come with me our
gallery has cutting edge analytics to
maximize deal flow and global demand.

PIERS
I’m fighting to get back to creation, to
revelation, the billion years of energy
sparking through our brains. I’m not
jetting around hawking fucking tickets.

JON DONDON
In an attention economy celebrity is

PIERS

You know I only give commission on my new
work, The repros and prints and replicas
are all marketed under my own brand.

JON DONDON
I and my team are more than ecstatic to
partner exclusively on your future work.

PIERS
I hear Rhodora sold Sphere for 7 million.

That was the body you said you found.
Some random old guy, no family or
friends. I forget to feed the cat but
that is how you put it. I won’t bother
with the obvious questions but you must
have some giant plans. Well I invented
do-it-yourself, going back to my punk
days, and short of some sad piddling
about you're in way over head, doll. You
have to archive and catalogue and
establish ownership and of course
monetize. I’m willing to do all that for
a reasonable percentage. You can engage
me in an endless lawsuit or we can become
rich and I’1l1 teach you on the way. So
that’s decided. Now who else knows any
of this?

for a four-decade fixation exploring the
bonds, fragility and terror of childhood.

«+» PARENTS AND CHILDREN ... BEAUTY ... LOVE ... ABUSE ...

MORF’S VOICE
Removed from established art circles,
Vetril created a pictorial saga with no
apparent regard of commerce or
recognition. His epic work, at times
accompanied by text, tracks a family torn
by the conflict between innocence and
evil, frequently depicting infants and
children endangered by those entrusted
with their care.

come around MORF ... examine him closely as he writes ...

MORF’S VOICE
Dease’s world appears hermetically
sealed, The geography is an amorphous
suburban landscape with glimpses of
industry and a mountain retreat called
Lake Of Constance, a well-spring from
which creativity seems derived.

Dease used a highly unique pastiche
process to create a realm where youth
struggles to survive in the penumbra of
adults, whose actions often seem
contradictory, threatening and violent.

MORF stretches ... gets naked ... joins JOSEPHINA in bed ...

MORE’ S VOICE
Children in Dease’s world are hardly
benign, however, as authority figures

RHODORA
If Debeers released all their diamonds
they’d be cheap as cut glass. Didn't
they teach any of this in art school?

JOSEPHINA
How many are we saying he made?

RHODORA
Their value is their scarcity, there’s no
stockpiling for future sale. So it’s not
what we say. It’s reality.

JOSEPHINA
The reality is we have over 3000 pieces
stored upstairs.

Is your food salty? Mine’s over-salted.
I have to update my Yelp review. So as I
research this I’m starting to think Dease
didn’t simply use pastiche as a medium,
he chose it to parallel depth of meaning.
A way to emphasize themes. The writing
in his folios express a persistent and
deep distrust of materialism. There's a
reverence for the sanctity and
transformative power of art that runs
through all of his work, accompanied by
fury and disgust for the world of money.

RHODORA
Well the great ones are usually off.

MORE
This is highly evolved. He's railing
against art being co-opted and corrupted
for purely-commercial ends.

RHODORA
Because the tortured soul only knew
squalor. We believed all that when Polly
and I started in punk, crashing in dirty
rehearsal rooms, screwing anyone who had
a bed. You can’t live on sunshine. It
was on that point Polly and I parted.

MORE
I thought I’d be able to find more facts
and biographical information but there’s
@ 30-year gap where he just disappears.
When he resurfaces he’s a modern day
hermit. The bottom line is I need more
money for research.

RHODORA
Get an advance from the publisher.

MORE
I did. I spent it already. It wasn’t
enough to get to the heart of who Dease
was. Look you want this to be good.

RHODORA
I grasp the upside. Whatever you need.

MORE
Thank you. I hear Jon Dondon’s very
upset at you about Piers. Word is you
very cleverly palmed Piers off on Jon
because he’s run out of creative gas.

RHODORA
He’s forgotten he can fly.

MORE
Jon was going to take the income from
Piers and knock you down to number two.

RHODORA
Man perishes without a dream. Well I
have to go. Our installer disappeared
and left us all in a lurch, right when
we're shipping out the Dease exhibit
buys. Speaking of, Josephina didn’t come

GRETCHEN
Well on to Vetril Dease. In the United

there’s a hotter artist at the moment.
Did you know since the exhibit opening
he’s actually trending on twitter?

MUSEUM CURATING WOMAN
We're interested in showing him.

GRETCHEN
It’s quite rare to be present the moment
something is pronounced great, and rarer
still to have access to the work.

MUSEUM CURATING MAN
How many pieces are we talking about?

GRETCHEN
I can supply two owned by my client,
large-format, landmark product, and
another 10 on loan from the Haze gallery.
I'm offering all for immediate display.

MUSEUM CURATING MAN
Send dimensions and jpegs for the group
and we can aim for a slot next season.

GRETCHEN
I want them exhibited ASAP. Main hall,
new wing, event marketing.

MUSEUM CURATING WOMAN
You know we have a process Gretchen.

GRETCHEN
I had a glorious concept to support my
former employer and supposedly premier
contemporary art museum in Los Angeles
with the first showing of a Dease.

MUSEUM CURATING MAN
We appreciate the significance. We also
appreciate the financial benefit to you
and your client to have them shown here,
but there’s the issue of space.

GRETCHEN
Move Banyo’s Horse Penis or the Jeweled
Vagina. Put one inside the other for all
I care. There’s tax issues and my client
wants his Dease exhibited immediately.
Now in return for my very generous offer
I also want Minkins’ Sphere to be shown.

MUSEUM CURATING MAN
Come on Gretchen, this isn’t a rug
bazaar.

GRETCHEN
No, it’s an equation with a solution at
the end. If you can’t grasp that there’s
other museums I assure you that will.

The place has been closed for years.

RHODORA
What caused the crash?

DETECTIVE
Don’t know. There was no sign of alcohol
or drugs. We think he must have hit his
head and wandered off. The park service
is searching the area. It’s easy to get
lost out there.

RHODORA
What was recovared?

DETECTIVE
We put it in the back.

RHODORA, JOSEPHINA and the DETECTIVE look in the BACK where
some tools ... food wrappers ... old clothes are seen ...

JOSEPHINA
That’s all you found?

DETECTIVE
The vehicle might have been vandalized

I didn’t tell him what was in the crates.
All he had to do was deliver them to a
warehouse in Lancaster.

JOSEPHINA
He’s taken them. He’s gonna start
selling them himself. This shit goes

we searched the deeper databases.

WE’ RE
pushing though the gallery ... toward JON with RUSKINSPEAR ...

RUSKINSPEAR
We tried the name Vetril Raymond Dease
and it flagged nada in terms of any
biographical info, however putting his
middle name Raymond first uncovered the
reason for him living as he did.

RUSKINSPEAR hands JON a file marked RUSKINSPEAR & ASSOCS ...

RUSKINSPEAR
Raymond Dease suffered some sort of
breakdown in his early 20s. Apparently
he tracked down his father and murdered
him. The details are in the court
records there. Dease spent 30 years ina
psychiatric hospital for the criminally
insane. When he was released he moved to
L.A., changed his first name to Vetril,
got a job at the Veteran’s home and
disappeared.

You're absolutely sure of all this?

We shared the same pharmacologist. Poor

some sort of episode.

RHODORA.
On or off meds I never once knew him to
catch even a glimmer beyond his own self-
importance. My money it must have been

I find the timing of it just utterly
bizarre given his call to me. I

Don’t lay that on me. Like he was your

“Dependency murders creativity.
Creativity plays with the unknown. No
strategies exist that can enclose the
endless realm of the new. Only trust in
yourself can carry you past your fears
and the already known. To create you
have to mova toward what you can’t see
and urge it into being.” Polly Anna,

Not catalogued. Rhodora only wanted an
overview so we just chose several dozen
representative works. I identified
conventions, work flow, classifications.

How many pieces did you inventory?

ARCHIVIST
It was an object rich collection.

More than 3000?

I couldn’t hazard a guess, Rhodora has
the inventory worksheets I'm sure.

There’s a discrepancy.

have taken months, compounded of course

Seriously, Gretchen. It’s rude. And
dumb. If you wanted to ram more of your
collector’s hoard down our throats to
increase their value you should have done
so before the Dease deal was locked, not
the night prior to the exhibit’s open.

GRETCHEN
I hear marketing has high hopes for a
traveling Dease collection, they’ve even
run projections. I believe my leverage
looking ahead is considerable.

CURATING MAN
There’s absolutely no space in the Fall
to put on a Minkins show.

some vital ideal.

RHODORA walking by ... AN EXHIBIT OF VERY LARGE LENSES ... SHE

RHODORA
A bit baroque don’t you think?

MORE
I came here to warn you.

RHODORA
It’s been a fucked up few weeks but
listen to yourself. What are you saying?

MORE
Stop selling Dease.

RHODORA
It’s a nine~figure collection.

MORE
I’m writing an article about this. About
Dease, his work and past and methods,
about everything that’s gone down.

RHODORA
You’11 kill your career.

MORF
Get rid of it, box it away, all of it.
That’s what I’m doing.
MORF walking away ... calling to him ...

RHODORA
Oh c’mon. Come back here.

MORF becoming tiny and telescoped in an EXHIBITION LENSES ...

RHODORA
Don’t you know, all art is dangerous.

MORF’S blurred form disappears and DISSOLVE TO

++. JOSEPHINA dressed in downtown couture as ... she ENTERS

RHODORA’S OFFICE
and finds RHODORA on the phone ... mid-call ...

RHODORA/ON PHONE
It’s been a feeding frenzy since the
debut ... What’s changed is we ran new
metrics and realized we’ve been overly
precious with supply ... I sent you six
Dease JPEGS, all available for immediate
purchase at the quoted price and destined
for significant appreciation.

RHODORA taps a key on her computer and ... SIX PHOTOS OF DEASE
ART £111 the screen ...

RHODORA/ON PHONE
All of them, that’s swell ... I’11 send
the papers ... Of course you are, see you
in Basel.
(hangs up, keys the intercom)
Who’s next?

ASSISTANT/OVER PHONE
That’s everyone on the sheet. We're
waiting for call backs.

JOSEPHINA
What’s going on? We closed the first
phase on Dease. Why are we selling more?

RHODORA closes the office door ...

RHODORA
Morf’s hell-bent on writing a story.
He’s connecting Bryson disappearance and
Gretchen and Jon’s deaths to the Dease
pieces. He believes they’re somehow
channeling some sort of spirit.

JOSEPHINA
What kind of spirit?

RHODORA
I don’t know the varieties.

JOSEPHINA
He’s literally been acting so weird. You
know we broke up this morning.
gl.

RHODORA
Now you tell ma? Jesus Josephina, your
connection with him was useful.

JOSEPHINA
What? I should’ve stayed with him?

RHODORA
You should have kept me informed. his
influence is not unsubstantial.

JOSEPHINA
So he writes some bat-shit story, who
cares?

RHODORA
We don’t sell durable goods, we peddle
perception. Thin as a bubble. A piece
like this, by Morf, could start a run.
Call your buyers, sell as much Dease as
you can before he posts something.

ASSISTANT/OVER INTERCOM

RHODORA/INTO PHONE
Hey doll ... I’m circling back on you
wanting some museum-quality Dease.

You couldn’t afford it. We don’t want
it. Trust me. I’m doing you a favor,

JOSEPHINA straddles him ... hands roving ... DAMRISH ...

DAMRISH
I gotta get down to Traction Avenue.

JOSEPHINA
I thought we were spending the night in.

DAMRISH
Something came up I gotta deal with.
Tonight.

JOSEPHINA
You're blowing me off?

Why do you keep calling?

JOSEPHINA
Why? Are you serious? We break up and
now you’re writing a story to destroy my
livelihood? I want you to stop whatever
the fuck it is you’re working on.

MORE
I’m not doing this to get back at you.

JOSEPHINA
Are you even aware you’ve lost your mind?

We don’t realize the value of friends
until they’re gone. I still consider you
a friend, Josephina.

JOSEPHINA
Go fuck yourself. Then lose my number.

MORF
With this article I’m pouring gas on
myself and lighting a match. I don’t
have a choice. It’s been revealed to mea
that I handed in the wrong life review
and there is some sort of larger power,
some entity invested in our endeavor.

coco
Invested how?

MORE
In the violation of inviolate rules.
What if what’s shown isn’t what people
want, it’s what we feed them. Have I
gone mad?

coco
You're asking me? I found both bodies.
I’m sleeping with the lights on. On top
of which if I don’t land something soon
I’11 have to return home.

MORE
I’m leaving town while my article breaks
but I could use an assistant here for a
few weeks while I’m gone.

coco
Really?
96.

MORF
If you're interested.

coco
Iam. Thank you. That means a lot.

I’m storing some art tonight and leaving
early tomorrow. These are keys to my
storage space. I need to have everything
itemized that’s there.

MORF eats ... catches COCO regarding him ...

I have something in my teeth?
coco
No.
MORF
What?

I can’t keep it in. You're gonna be
upset.
MORF
Okay.
coco
Like seriously.
MORF
Uh oh.
coco
It’s really fucked up.
MORE
What is it?
coco

I was Rhodora’s personal assistant. I
saw her checks. Rolled calls with her.
I think she sometimes forgot I was on.

MORF
Tell ma.

coco
Your ex-boyfriend, Ed. He worked for
her,
97.

MORF
You mean worked her out, he’s a trainer.

coco
No. I mean Rhodora paid Ed to give her
advance word on your reviews. He told
her what you liked before you posted and
she made buys.

MORF motionless ... wind-whipped trees behind him ...
coco
She gave him a lot of money. Like maybe
that was why Ed was with you.
MORF still as a statue ...

coco
Do I still have the job?

MORF downs his wine ... pours another glass and CUT TO

JOSEPHINA
Hey.

BEN stares ... walks off ...

JOSEPHINA
Lovely. Can we leave now?

DAMRISH
I’m staying.

JOSEPHINA

I don’t like this place.

DAMRISH
I’m talking longer time line. I’m
leaving Rhodora. Her gallery.

JOSEPHINA
No you're not.

DAMRISH
I can’t be there.

JOSEPHINA
We have a significant show planned.
You’re high, c’mon.

JOSEPHINA tugs his arm ... DAMRISH not moving ...

DAMRISH
I mean it.

JOSEPHINA
You’re about to break big. We’re taking
you global. You’d give that up? For
what? Some sad garage space peddling
graffiti murals? Jesus what’s the point
of art if nobody sees it?
