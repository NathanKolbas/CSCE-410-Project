Based on the novel
My Abandonment by Peter Rock
EXT. SALVAGE LOT - AFTERNOON 1
WILL, 40s, sorts through piles of industrial hardware and

cable. When he finds several pieces of metal grate, he sets
them aside. His daughter, TOM, young teens, works with him.

WILL
We only need one more.

She hands him one she’s found. They leave a small payment
for the man who lives in the lot.
EXT. FOREST PARK, ENTRANCE - AFTERNOON 2

Tom and Will enter a dense park by scrambling up a
gully, avoiding the public entrance.

They're in Forest Park, a temperate rain forest abutting the
city of Portland, Oregon.
EXT. FOREST PARK - LATE AFTERNOON 3

Not using an established path, they walk over fallen trees
and bushes.

Tom stops. She holds back some brambles. On the ground is a
dead animal. She picks up a stick and examines the body.

WILL
How many organs can you identify?

Tom peers through under growth to an animal’s body.

TOM

That’s his liver. Lungs. Heart.
WILL

Good.
TOM

(pointing with the stick)
I’m not sure what that is.

WILL
Spleen.
TOM
What happened?

WILL
Someone probably hit him with their
car. He came too close to town.

They walk away into the woods.

EXT. FOREST PARK, ENCAMPMENT - AFTERNOON 4

They arrive at a spot where they toss down their packs.
They're home. Will lights a lantern which emits a low light.

He pulls back some large branches which they’ve used to
obscure their dwelling, constructed with a tent and tarps.
In front of it, they’ve set up a small cooking area. A
camping stove is perched on a flat rock and two tree stump
stools are arranged around a small table fashioned from a
board.

Will stashes their groceries in a buried food cooling cache.
Tom lights a lamp.

He processes wood - splitting it with his knife.

Tom feathers the tinder sticks.

Will ignites the tinder with the ferro rod

They sit together and eat their soup.
INT. FOREST PARK, ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT
Will is reading. Tom arranges her sleeping bag.

WILL
Need a second layer?

TOM
I’m fine.

She gets in and comfortable. He turns out the light.

TOM (CONT'D)
See you in the a.m.

They make their private clicking communication sound.

After a moment, they hear the sound of snapping branches as
some dogs run through the brush and through their camp. One
dog stops to sniff around their tent. Will switches on a
flashlight and they can see the outline of its snout
protruding through the shelter wall. Will reaches for a pan
and bangs it with a spoon, which sends the dog away.

TOM (CONT'D)
I named the head dog Layla.

WILL
If she’s such a good friend of
yours, you could tell her that
we're trying to get some sleep
around here.

TOM
I don’t speak dog.

Will smiles.

WILL
Let’s try to get back to sleep.

He settles in attempting to fall asleep again, but is wide
awake.
EXT. FOREST PARK, ENCAMPMENT - DAY 6

Tom walks along a fallen tree to a small garden covered by a
transparent plastic tarp. She pulls back the tarp and weeds.

As she works, she gets distracted by pill bugs and centipedes
under a log. She uses a magnifier to look closely at the
centipede. With the knife on her belt, she cuts deeper into
the log and reveals more bugs.

EXT. FOREST PARK — DAY 7

Tom forages in the forest for edible plants. She uses a small
pair of field glasses to identify a bird she hears.

She pokes around a fallen tree and discovers the yellow tip
of a chanterelle mushroom hidden underneath.

TOM
Yes!

She investigates further and finds a small patch of the
mushrooms and begins snapping them off at the base. In the
distance, she can hear her father make a a bird sound.

Tom answers him with an owl sound.

She gathers the mushrooms, puts them in the pocket of her
hoodie and heads back to camp.

EXT. FOREST PARK, ENCAMPMENT - DAY 8
She cuts through some low brush to get to Will. He's
immersed in building a solar cooker, using the scrap metal

they collected as a base.

TOM
Look what I found.

He glances up to look at the mushrooms, but he’s absorbed in
what he’s constructing.

WILL
Excellent. Good haul. Give me a
hand here?

She holds pieces of foil while Will tacks them in place over
the frame of an umbrella.

She looks at the book he’s using to learn about solar
cooking.
10

TOM
Do you think we’ll ever be able to
cook on this? It seems better for a
sunny state.

WILL
There’s radiant energy even when
you can’t see the sun.

TOM
Maybe so, but I couldn’t wait 2
weeks for an egg.
He’s in thought about improvements.

TOM (CONT'D)
This’ll be good in summer.

TOM (CONT'D)
I’m hungry. Can we finish this
later?
WILL
Yes.
He smiles at her.
EXT. FOREST PARK, ENCAMPMENT - DAY 9

Will, in his city clothes, conservative neutral colored
garments, combs his beard. He clicks to get her attention.

TOM
Code Brown.

After a moment, Tom comes from behind the privacy tarp,
dressed in her clothes for town. She washes her hands. .

WILL
Clean your nails.

He passes her a sharpened stick. She notices a long pine
needle in his clothing and picks it off.

He tidies up their dwell space and she coves the lids of
cache buckets.

They check each others’ clothing and do one last preening.

EXT. FOREST PARK — DAY 10

Tom and Will walk parallel to each other through the trees.
At one point, Will stops, crouches down, and looks back from
where they’ve come to see if their path can be detected.
SA

WILL
We've been this way one time too
Many. New route needed.

They continue on.

TOM
It’s only Tuesday. Why are we going
to town today?

WILL
Schedules and routines are fine,
but you don’t want to be
predictable. That’s when you get
hit, by being overconfident.

(pause)
Anyway, we're low on food -- milk
powder, oatmeal. Your appetite is
growing.
TOM

I'm growing!

WILL
I know.

She smiles at him.

EXT. FOREST PARK, PUBLIC PATH - DAY 11
As they approach the boundary of where the park meets paved
streets, Tom and Will exit using one of the public paths and
stairs, looking like any other folk leaving the park. Tom
spots a necklace on the ground. She picks it up, looks at it,
and puts it back on the ground.
TOM
If it’s still here when we get
back, can I take it?

WILL
Yep. That’s fair.
EXT. FOREST PARK, ENTRANCE - DAY 12

Will and Tom quickly scramble down a steep gully in Forest
Park.

They check each others’ appearance, brushing off bits of
forest debris, from clothing, hair, and beard.

They walk in the direction of the St. John’s Bridge.

EXT. ST. JOHN’S BRIDGE - DAY 13

They walk across the bridge to get into town.

EXT. ST JOHN’S SQ. - DAY Al3

They deposit two small bags of garbage into the dumpster.

INT. AIR TRAM - DAY 14

Tom looks at the city; Will looks at the enormous medical
complex looming in front of them. There are a few other
passengers. TWO MEDICAL WORKERS in white coats are in the
mix. As they approach, The VA hospital takes up the whole
view.

INT. VA MEDICAL CENTER - DAY 15

Tom is in the waiting room reading. Her book obscures her
face. She glances up at the glass passageways of this
labyrinth.
6aA

16 INT. VA MEDICAL CENTER - DAY 16

Will meets back up with Tom. He stows the meds package that
he’s been given at the clinic into his back pack.
17

EXT. ATM - DAY

Will withdraws money from an ATM.

INT. GROCERY STORE - DAY 18

They shop efficiently for the essentials. Will puts a
chocolate bar in the cart, and Tom is surprised.

TOM
Is that a want or a need?
WILL
Both.
She seems pleased.
EXT. ST. JOHN’S BRIDGE - DAY Al18

Tom and Will cross the bridge, carrying a tote with their
groceries

EXT. FOREST PARK, MEN’S CAMP —- DAY 19

Tom and Will approach an encampment in a different section of
the park, comprised of several tents. One has an American
flag hanging off the front and a wheelchair beside it.

One of the men living in the camp, LARRY, a vet who knows
Will from the VA, greets them. Larry opens the package of
pill bottles, tearing off the warning labels that are affixed
to the bottles and the suicide literature that the VA packs
in every bundle. Two of the bottles are smaller than the
others.

LARRY
They've changed the cocktail again.

Larry checks the label on the small bottles.

LARRY (CONT'D)
Less Roxi’s, less bars. Figures,
they're cuttin’ back on the ones
that have any value to us.

He checks the big bottles.

LARRY (CONT'D)
Looks like someone’s tryin’ to
unload the sleep meds -- Seroquel,
it really has no value to me. I'd
have to find someone who wants to
sleep all day and gain 70 pounds.
(rifling through the bag

Prazosin - when’s the last time
that stopped a nightmare? They
must be gettin’ a deal on these.
Will nods. Larry takes all the bottles and pays Will.

WILL
They’re harder to get.

7A
20

21

LARRY
First, they give ‘em out like
candy, and now they’re yankin’ the
leash back.

Will makes a small parting gesture.
LARRY (CONT'D)
Whatever they’re givin’ you, I'll
take ‘em off your hands.
He looks over at Tom.
WILL
Let's go.
EXT. FOREST PARK - DAY 20

Tom and Will walk away from the men’s camp up a curving path
into the trees.

TOM
It’s weird, going there.

WILL
If you’re going to say something,
be specific.

TOM
It makes me feel sad to be there.

WILL
That makes sense.

TOM
Then why do we go?

WILL
We don’t need the meds, but we can
use the money.

EXT. FOREST PARK, ENCAMPMENT - DAY 21

Will clears the air shaft for the dakota pit. He maintains
the water catchment system.
22

23

EXT. FOREST PARK — DAY 22

Tom ventures into a part of the forest that is far from their
camp and closer to the public hiking paths. In the trees she
can see the orange vests of an inmate WORK CREW. AN OFFICER
walks back and forth supervising. Tom spies from behind the
trees. She moves closer, staying in the shadows.

The worker closest to sees Tom through the branches and
stares. They lock eyes for a minute.

Tom steps back and hurries away.

EXT. FOREST PARK, ENCAMPMENT - DAY 23
Will’s working on a fire, but the dampness makes it hard to
start. Tom chops the mushrooms. She’s hungry and the fire is
taking a long time.

WILL
This is all so wet.

TOM
Can we use the propane?

WILL
Heard your stomach growl.

He nods that propane is the way to go in this instance.
24

25

10

She turns on the propane camp stove and the mushrooms cook
quickly. She gives Will one to taste. They enjoy.

Will now hears the sound of the power tools from the work
crew in the distance.

TOM
I saw them earlier, it’s OK, it’s a
work crew. They’re way down by the
pathways.

WILL
Drill.

She pops the last of the mushroom into her mouth. He shuts
down the stove, moving quickly fueled by adrenalin.
EXT. FOREST PARK, FERN GROVE - DAY 24
He hustles Tom along to their emergency hiding area. Will
watches her hide in the foliage of a large fern. He checks
from all angles to see if she’s truly covered, but she’s
slightly visible.
WILL

The pattern of the face is the

first thing someone can recognize.
She pulls herself deeper into the fern.

TOM
Dad, I know how to do this.

Her hiding is not precise enough.

WILL
Then be good at it.

He covers himself in the foliage in a way that makes him
imperceptible.
EXT. FOREST PARK, HIDING SPOT - DAY 25

Tom relaxes in her hiding spot, which she uses as a look-out.
She's reading the section on sea horses in the encyclopedia.
26

27

11

From below, the sound of cracking sticks can be heard, and
soon the huffing and puffing of a man. An off-trail RUNNER
comes into the clearing. He stops and puts his hands on his
knees, spitting on the ground.

As Tom scoots farther back on the hiding spot to be out of
his sight, she knocks a book off. The runner doesn’t see the
book fall, but hears it and turns around, craning his neck to
see if he can spot someone. Tom contracts into a small ball.

RUNNER
Hello? Somebody up there?

He steps back a few paces trying to see more, catching a
glimpse of her.

RUNNER (CONT'D)
Hello?

Tom holds her breath. She remains utterly still waiting until
she can hear him resume his run and leave the area.

She peers over the edge to confirm that he’s gone.

EXT. FOREST PARK, HIDING SPOT - DAY 26

Tom, back on the ground moves quietly in the direction where
the runner took off to check that he’s no longer in sight.
It hits her that an outsider has seen her. She sits for a
moment to collect herself.

At the base of the log she’s sitting on, she finds an odd
looking mushroom, which she picks and heads home.

EXT. FOREST PARK, ENCAMPMENT - DAY 27

As Tom approaches their camp, she finds Will looking at the
Forest Park map. She sits near him, still shaken from the
runner encounter. When he looks up, she hands him the weird
mushroom to examine.

Tom looks through the Wild Edible Mushroom Guide and tries to
match it to one of the photos.

TOM
Fairy ring mushroom --no
ink cap, hexagonal-pored polypore,
common puffball, Avenging Angel...

She stops on the next page and double checks the mushroom
against the photo.

TOM (CONT’D)
I think I found it. The Prince!
28

WILL
Double check that it has no deadly-
poisonous lookalikes.

TOM
I did.

WILL
Check again.

Tom sketches the mushroom in her mushroom and fungi
and writes the number 21 on it.

TOM
We're up to 21.
INT. FOREST PARK, ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT

Tom is awakened by Will, who is having a nightmare.
gently nudges her father.

TOM
Dad. Wake up. You were having a
dream.

WILL
Whoa.

Will takes a deep breath.

TOM
What’s your favorite color?
WILL
What’s yours?
TOM
Yellow.
WILL
Why?
TOM

The way it makes me feel. It’s
bright and not still.

WILL
Mine’s green.

TOM
That figures. And what was my
mother’s favorite color?

WILL
Yellow.

TOM
Maybe she taught me that, for it to
be my favorite.

WILL
In some way.Let’s get some sleep;
it’s late.

TOM
I wish I could remember her.

WILL
She would’ve wished that, too. Good
night, Yellow.

TOM
Good night, Green.

EXT. FOREST PARK, ENCAMPMENT - DAY 29

A chess game is in process.

WILL

Always try to control the 4 squares
TOM

Food, clothing, shelter, fuel.
WILL

Yes. In front of your King and

Queen.

(he moves her king’s pawn

up two squares forward)
A lot of people think it looks
dangerous to move the pawn in front
of the King, but as long as you
Castle, it will be safe for a
while.

It’s Tom’s move. They both hear unfamiliar distant sounds.
Will listens intently, detecting the muffled sounds of a
walkie-talkie. Will and Tom look at each other, knowing this
is not a drill. The sound gets louder. As Tom starts to sweep
the chess pieces back in their box, Will grabs her arm and
they run through the trees.

EXT. FOREST PARK, FERN GROVE - DAY 30

Tom scrambles into hiding. Will, a couple feet away, also
disappears.

Then everything grows quiet.

EXT. FOREST PARK, ENCAMPMENT - SAME 31
A K-9 OFFICER looks through their camp and picks up a piece
of clothing to let the dog register the scent.

EXT. FOREST PARK, FERN GROVE - DAY 32
A POLICE OFFICER scans the area.

Peering out from her hiding spot, Tom can see a boot crushing
ferns around her.

The K-9 officer arrives and lets the dog off the leash.

After a moment, the dog discovers Will.
13A
POLICE
Stand up.
Will gets to his feet.

POLICE (CONT'D)
Hands behind your head.
14

The officer pats him down and removes Will’s knife.

POLICE (CONT'D)
Do you have any ID?

WILL
Not on me. My military ID- it’s in
my pack.

POLICE

Why were you running?

WILL
We didn’t know who you were.

POLICE
Are you alone?

Pause. Will has to make a decision. The K-9 officer feeds the
dog snacks from a pouch.

WILL
My daughter’s with me. Tom, come
out.

Tom stands up and the officials turn to see her. She throws
her small camping knife to the ground.

POLICE
(to Tom)
Come on over here.

Tom looks to her father. He nods that she should do what’s
asked.

JEAN, a social worker, is lead in by the RANGER. Will backs
away slightly.

POLICE (CONT'D)
Sir, we need you to stay where you
are. Please stop moving around. I
don’t wanna have to cuff you.

Tom grabs her dad’s arm.

POLICE (CONT'D)

(trying to use a softer
tone with Tom)
Please, step aside.

WILL
(to the cop)
We're not a threat -- you don’t
have to act this way in front of
her.
15

POLICE
We don’t know who you are or what
the situation is here.

Jean gently inserts herself between Tom and Will as the
police officer leads Will away, with the ranger following.
Tom looks past Jean to keep Will in her sight.

TOM
Dad!

Will stops walking and the police have to tug at him. Tom
tries to get around Jean to follow her father. Jean gently
stops her, but she pushes against her.

TOM (CONT'D)
PLEASE! I want to go where my dad
goes.

JEAN
We'll figure this out. We’re gonna
make sure you’re OK.

TOM
We're OK!
JEAN
We're here to help.
TOM
We don’t need help.
JEAN
Hey, I’m Jean. What is your name?
TOM
Tom. Why did you chase us?
JEAN
We need to know what’s going on
here.
TOM
You needed a dog to figure that
out?
JEAN
We couldn’t have found you
otherwise.

They walk off in the direction of the encampment.

33 EXT. FOREST PARK, ENCAMPMENT - DAY 33

Tom and Jean approach the camp where Will
16

has been detained. Tom sees the runner waiting with the
ranger. The runner glances in her direction, trying to see
who she is.

The K-9 officer has entered their living quarters.

WILL
There are some library books to
return. Green pack at the back.

Will hears one of the book crates topple over, followed by a
dish crashing.

WILL (CONT'D)
We're not hiding anything from you.

Jean leads Tom to sit down on a log. Tom keeps her eyes on
her dad as the officer turns him around so Jean can talk
privately to her.

JEAN
You don’t have to worry. He’1ll be
all right. We’re going to focus on
you.

The ranger checks out the camp, snapping photos of the
stealth fire pit.

POLICE
You had no idea they had fire up
here?

The ranger shakes his head, intrigued.
JEAN

You guys are pretty well set up.
How long have you been here?

TOM

A long time.
JEAN

Can you tell me who you live with?
TOM

My dad.
JEAN

It’s only the two of you?
TOM

Yes.
JEAN

Can you show me where you sleep?

Tom brings her to the entrance of the shelter and shows her.
16aA

TOM
My sleeping bag here. Dad’s there.
16A

POLICE
Sir!
34

17

Tom and Jean look up to see that Will has walked up to them.
Both cops hold him back.

The officers look at Jean, who nods OK to them. They release
Will a little, and he approaches Tom. He leans in and speaks
softly.

WILL
We've got nothing to hide. It’s
very important that we cooperate
with them.
Tom pushes forward and puts her arms around her father.

WILL (CONT'D)
We'll be back together soon.

He bends down to be on her eye level.

The cop, carrying Will’s pack, and the K-9 unit lead Will
away. The ranger and runner follow. Will turns back and
smiles at Tom, who uses her sleeve to wipe her eyes.

EXT. FOREST PARK, ENCAMPMENT - DAY 34

Jean waits for Tom. She gathers her journal, some books, and
clothes, stuffing them into her pack.

TOM
When am I coming back?
JEAN
I don’t think you will be.
TOM
Will somebody bring my
encyclopedias?
JEAN

We'll see if we can have somebody
come back for those.

Jean realizes what she’s just said and how untrue it is.
JEAN (CONT'D)

Actually, pick two letters, take
your two favorite letters for now.
35

18

Tom emerges from their dwelling with her pack and two volumes
of the encyclopedia.

JEAN (CONT'D)
Does your dad ever drink or take
pills that make him act strange?

Tom nods no.

JEAN (CONT'D)
Does your dad have any weapons
here? Anything that could hurt
someone?

Tom nods no.

JEAN (CONT'D)
Or places where you’ve seen him
hide things?

Tom opens the buried cache bucket which contains papers in a
ziplock bag, a collection of utility knives and a small saw.
Jean looks in. Tom retrieves the papers and then closes the
lid and covers it back up.

Tom arranges branches to camouflage the cache.

Jean lets her finish covering the entrance with branches.
They head away from the camp. Tom is nimble in this terrain.
Prickers grab at Jean’s clothing.

EXT. FOREST PARK, TURNOUT - DAY 35

They exit Forest Park to where the Social Services van is
parked, near a large park diagram. Tom looks around for Will.
Jean opens the back door and gestures for Tom to get in. She
doesn’t.

TOM
Where’s my dad?

JEAN
He’s on his way to our office to
answer some questions.

(MORE )
18A
JEAN (CONT'D)

And we need to ask you some too.

You'll see him soon, but you’re

going to have to be a little

patient. I know this is hard.
36

19

Jean gestures again for her to get in. She does. She closes
her door and gets into the driver's seat.

INT. SOCIAL SERVICES, MEDICAL OFFICE - DAY 36

Tom, in a medical gown, is being examined by a female DOCTOR.
The doctor takes off a blood pressure cuff and puts the
otoscope away. She enters data on Tom as she preforms the
child wellness exam. She swipes her tablet.

DOCTOR
We're getting you into the system
here -- Thomasin. Is that your

preferred name and how you'd like
us to refer to you?

TOM
I'd like for you to refer to me as
Tom.

DOCTOR

I’m required by the state to ask:
“How do you identify? Female? Male?
Or Other?”

TOM
Female.

The doctor scrolls through more of the intake.

She looks in Tom’s ears with an otoscope. Checks eyes with a
medical eye pen, puts a blood pressure cuff on her arm.

DOCTOR
You are very healthy. Everything
looks good.

TOM
Where are my things?

DOCTOR
We'll give you back your clothes
very soon. We’re washing them and
putting them in the bug oven.

TOM
Bug oven?

DOCTOR
That's a way of heating clothes to
kill any body lice that may be in
your clothing.
37

20

TOM
I don’t have bugs living in my
clothing.

DOCTOR

We do this for everyone who stays
here. It’s a precaution.

INT. SOCIAL SERVICES DORM ROOM - DAY 37

Tom walks into the dorm room. She sees two teenagers, TIFFANY
and VALERIE, sitting at the table making collages from
magazines. She stands, not sure what to do.

VALERIE
Are you just gonna stand there?

TOM
Can I sit down?

VALERIE
Whatever you wanna do.

Tom sits down. She sees a plate of sandwiches on the table.

TOM
Can I have one of those sandwiches?

VALERIE
Knock yourself out, but not the
cheese one, that’s mine.

Tom takes a sandwich and eats. The girls keep cutting and
pasting.

TOM
What are you guys doing?

TIFFANY
Making dream boards.

TOM
What’s that?

VALERIE
Basically, you cut up magazines and
then you make a board of what you
want to do for the rest of your
life. Things that could make you
feel good about your future.

TIFFANY
Jean asks us to make them.
20A

TOM
[Tom may ask about Chanel detail on
the board]

VALERIE

So, what are you doing here?

TOM
I’m here because I wasn’t where I
was supposed to be, I guess. Well,
they don’t think I was where I was
supposed to be.

VALERIE

Okay, so, where were you?
TOM

I was with my dad. In Forest Park.
TIFFANY

Forest Park?
TOM

Yeah.
VALERIE

Like, the woods? Are you serious?
TIFFANY

Was your dad taking care of you?
TOM

Yes.
VALERIE

But you were homeless, basically.
TOM

No.
VALERIE

Then why else would you be living
in the woods?

TOM
Well, that was our home.

TIFFANY
If you had a home they wouldn’t
have brought you here.

TOM
Well, they just don’t understand
that that was our home.

TIFFANY
And where is your dad now?
20B

TOM
He’s somewhere in this building, I
think, but he’s gonna come and get
me in a couple hours, I think.

VALERIE
Your dad’s gonna come back and get
you?

TOM

Yeah. Why wouldn’t he? That’s what
Jean said. They’re just sorting it
out.

VALERIE
You know, just so you know, most of
the kids that come in here, their
dads don’t come back for them.
Tiffany, do you know anyone who’s
dad came back for them?

Valerie turns to Tiffany.

TIFFANY
I don’t know anyone whose dad came
back.

VALERIE

Yeah, me neither.

TOM
I know my dad’s coming back.

VALERIE
Don’t hold your breath.

They resume cutting images and tearing from magazines.

40 INT. SOCIAL SERVICES, JEAN'S OFFICE - DAY 40

Tom, in fresh clothes, works quickly filling out bubbles on
an exam form. She finishes.

TOM
I’m finished.

JEAN
Already?

TOM
Yes.

Jean leafs through the pages of the test booklet, nodding.
Surprised.

TOM (CONT'D)
It’s like homework only easier.

JEAN
Who gave you homework?

TOM
My dad.
23

JEAN
Who taught you to read? We have no
record of you going to school.

TOM
My dad teaches me. You said I
passed your test, so we should be
able to go back home.

JEAN
Yes, you’re actually quite a bit
ahead of where you need to be, but
school is about social skills too,
not only intellectual ones.

TOM

Is my dad taking tests like this?
JEAN

Yes, they’re asking him a lot of

questions.
Jean reels it back, sensing Tom’s concern.

JEAN (CONT'D)
I want you to understand what’s
happening, Tom.

TOM
OK.

JEAN

An off-trail runner reported seeing
a person in Forest Park, in a part
of the park where no one goes, who
he thought was a minor -- hiding
there, or maybe in need of help.

We had to check out the report to
make sure you were not in danger.

TOM
But you can see now that I’m all
right, and that I was with my
father.

Jean nods yes.

JEAN
Do you feel safe living with your
dad?

TOM

Yes.
24-26

JEAN
I know that the two of you share a
tent. Has this ever made you
uncomfortable?

TOM
No. The tent’s warmer with two
people.

JEAN
Has anyone ever touched your body
without your permission?

TOM
No. My dad would not let anything
bad happen to me.

Jean processes this, searching for her next question.

TOM (CONT'D)
We didn’t need to be rescued.

JEAN
That's what we’re trying to
understand.

TOM
What is it you want to understand?
That we could live differently from
how you’re used to it being and
still be fine?

Tom stares at Jean.

INT. SOCIAL SERVICES, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 41

Will is seated in front of a computer. JAMES, the other
social worker on the case arranges a key board in front of
Will.

James reads from the test instruction booklet.

JAMES
Respond “true” or “false” to each
statement. There are 435 items. If
you can’t answer, wait til the next
question. Complete as many as you
can. (beat) Are we good?

He brings the computer keyboard closer to Will.

JAMES (CONT'D)
I’m gonna leave you to it.

James pushes the start key and leaves.

TEST GIVER’S VOICE
Welcome. The test will begin in 3
seconds:

TEST GIVER'S VOICE
I wake up rested and peaceful most
mornings

WILL
True.

TEST GIVER'S VOICE
I enjoy reading articles on crime

WILL
False.

TEST GIVER'S VOICE
My daily life is full of activities
that keep me interested

WILL
True.

TEST GIVER’S VOICE
My sleep is fitful and troubled.

Beep. Will exceeds the limit and the computer presses on.

INT. SOCIAL SERVICES, JEAN’S OFFICE - DAY 42
Jean pulls out some flash cards.

JEAN
For each picture I want you to make
up a story.

Tom nods. Jean lays out four cards with symbolic drawings
onto the table.

JEAN (CONT'D)
Pick one.

Tom selects a card and studies it.

TOM
How do you read my answers? You
think they’re going to mean a
certain thing?

JEAN
They might be able tell us a little
more about you.
28

TOM
You could just ask.

JEAN
Yes. But you may not be able to say
it.

TOM

So you go at it in a crooked way.
Somehow I'll say what I can’t say?

Tom writes in the test booklet.

TOM (CONT'D)

Can I see my dad, now? Just for
five minutes? I know it’1l make
him feel better.

JEAN
You've been very patient. We’re
almost there.

Jean glances at her check list.

JEAN (CONT'D)
Would you say you’ve had a happy
childhood?

TOM
Yes.

JEAN
Does your father get angry if you
don’t agree with him?

TOM
No.

JEAN
What does happen when you do
something that your dad does not
agree with?

TOM
We discuss it.

JEAN
I wish I could have followed you
around for a day, just to see how
you guys operated.
43

44

29-29R

TOM
You wouldn’t have been able to. I'd
lose you in five minutes. The park
has 5,100 acres.

JEAN
It sounds to me like you really
loved it there. But Tom, you
understand that you can’t live in
the park anymore?

Tom looks down, averting Jean's gaze.

JEAN (CONT'D)
It’s not a crime to be unhoused --
many people are. But it is illegal
to live in the park.

Tom swallows hard, staring at the poster on the wall behind
Jean. She doesn’t notice Jean’s concern.

OMIT 43

INT. SOCIAL SERVICES, DORMITORY 44

Tiffany and Tom are looking at Tiffany’s phone. Tiffany is
explaining what instragram is and swiping through photos
she’s been sent. She comes to an image of a banana slug that
a friend posted from her visit to the park that day.

TIFFANY
What’s that?

TOM
Banana slug. You can eat them. You
have to cook it to get the slime
off. It tastes like a mushroom.

The instagram discussion moves from the banana slug to
Tiffany’s favorite singer and all of the followers she has.
Her battery dies.

Tiffany looks down at the few images Tom has collected.
TIFFANY
What are you gonna put on your
board? Anything besides trees?

TOM
I’m still looking.
29-29AA

Valerie comes back into the room and sits down at the table.
Tiffany moves back to her seat. Tom starts to work on her
dream board. Valerie is upset.

TIFFANY
How'd it go?

VALERIE
So, they couldn’t find a placement
for me in that district, so I won’t
be able to go to the school I
wanted to.

TIFFANY
What’d Jean say?

VALERIE
She was like, “I’m really sorry, I
tried really hard and blah blah
blah...”

Valerie looks down. Tiffany gives her a sympathetic look.

VALERIE (CONT'D)

She says I’m too high risk to place
and nobody wants a kid that’s my
age.

Tiffany tries to divert Valerie’s attention. She passes
Valerie an image that she thinks she’ll like for her board.

Valerie looks at the dream boards and experiences a wave of
frustratoin and disgust. She sweeps the boards and magazines
off the table.

VALERIE (CONT'D)
This is bullshit.

Tiffany and Tom watch as Valerie crosses the room and grabs a
stuffed teddy bear. She sits back down at the table and pulls
a needle out of the bear. She starts poking her finger with
the needle.

TOM
So, what are you gonna do?

VALERIE
I don’t know what I’m gonna do,
okay? If I knew what I was gonna do
this wouldn’t be such a big deal.

Tiffany shoots Tom a look. Valerie anticipates Tom’s question
and stops her from asking more.

VALERIE (CONT'D)
No one is coming to get me.
29-29AB

Tiffany is concerned that Valerie is hurting herself.

TIFFANY
Did you sterilize that?

VALERIE
Of course I sterilized it. No one’s
used it since the last time I used

it.
TIFFANY

Did you clean your finger?
VALERIE

Yes.
TOM

My dad says it’s important that if
you get a cut you need to clean it
out to prevent an infection from
spreading.

VALERIE
Your dad knows everything.

INT. SOCIAL SERVICES, JEAN’S OFFICE - DAY 45
Jean and James are meeting with Will for his exit evaluation.

JEAN
In finding a placement for you and
Tom, we've considered what kind of
support will be helpful to you two.

James stares at Will’s VA file, overwhelmed.

JAMES
We want to help you meet the legal
and social expectations of being a
family. We don’t want you in the
“system” How can we help you stay
out?

WILL
We'd like to go back to how we were
living, which is a way of life that
was working for us.

Beat.

WILL (CONT'D)
She has the rest of her life to
conform.

JAMES
Will, as much as we might want to
let you go back to living as you
were, we have no say over the rules
and regs in the park.

JEAN
We're just not sure it’s the best
thing for her.
Tense silence.
WILL
Don’t let the little light go out
in her.

Jean and James exchange a look, jot a note.
46

47

32

WILL (CONT'D)
We bother no one.

JAMES
Not surprisingly, you scored high
on the social introversion scale,
but that does not make you a
dangerous person.

Will takes a deep breath. James and Jean give Will an
affirming smile.

INT. SOCIAL SERVICES, HALLWAY - DAY 46

Jean leads Caroline down a maze of hallways. Finally they
arrive at her office, which Jean opens with her ring of keys.

INT. SOCIAL SERVICES, FOYER - DAY 47

Tom waits in the foyer. Jean approaches with her belongings
and puts them down.

JEAN
All your things.

Tom looks into her backpack and sees that her knife is still
in her pack.

TOM
Thank you for not taking my knife.

But her journal is not where she usually keeps it.

TOM (CONT'D)
Did you read my journal?

Jean looks uncomfortable.

TOM (CONT'D)
Have you been looking through it?

JEAN
Yes, I did. I’m sorry. With
underage people there’s a conflict
between your privacy and what we
need to know about you -- to ensure
your well being.

Tom withdraws, upset. Jean changes the subject.

JEAN (CONT'D)
I liked your notes about mushrooms.

TOM
That doesn’t make it okay.
JEAN
You're right. I should have asked
you, and we could have looked at it
together.

Jean moves on, tries to re-engage Tom.

JEAN (CONT'D)
Tom, we want to try something we
haven't done before. Usually, we'd
put you up in a motel until we
found some housing, but we found
something that will be better.

TOM
How can you say what’s good for us?

JEAN
We don’t have a lot of options, and
this seemed like the best one. We
found a place outside the city
where you and your dad can stay
until we can get you into permanent
housing. I’11 be checking in with
you regularly to see how you guys
are doing.

She cuts to the chase.

JEAN (CONT'D)
What do you think about going to a
regular school?

TOM
My dad can teach me.

JEAN
But you can have friends your own
age. Wouldn’t you like that?

TOM
Sometimes I think I would, and
other times I don’t think so.

JEAN
Do you have any questions you'd
like to ask me?

TOM
What’s going to happen to Tiffany
and Valerie.

JEAN
We're in the process of finding
them foster placements.

INT. SOCIAL SERVICES, FOYER - DAY 48
Will is brought in, beard groomed, wearing stiff new jeans
and a bright colored new coat. Tom stands up when she sees
him. They hug tightly.

EXT. SOCIAL SERVICES - DAY A48

Will and Tom come out the front doors of the facility.

INT. CAR - DAY 49

Tom and Will are in the back seat as they drive through town.

INT. CAR, SOUTH OF CITY - DAY 50
They drive through the Christmas tree farms south of
Portland. Will looks out the window. Tom opens her pack and
gives Will his shemagh. He’s pleased to see it and stows it.

Jean puts on the radio. After some irritating ads and babble
she re-considers.

JEAN
Would you like it off?

WILL
Yes.

[wild lines important for this part of the ride]

INT. CAR, HORSE FARM - DAY 51
The car turns onto a private road where they see rows of
Christmas trees and a house on a hill.

EXT. MR. WALTERS’ HOUSE - DAY 52
The car pulls up and parks in a driveway where the owner, MR.
WALTERS, 50's, greets them, and they get out of the car.

EXT. HORSE FARM, COTTAGE - DAY B52

Tom, Will, Jean and Mr. Walter’s enter the cottage.

INT. COTTAGE - DAY 53

Tom and Will look through their new home, escorted by Mr.
Walters and Jean.
JEAN
We hope this will work for you.

WILL
Thank you.

JEAN
Mr. Walters is a generous man.

Will nods.

34aA
34A

MR. WALTERS
I’m excited we can do this. I read
about you in the newspaper when
they found you in the park.

Jean opens the cupboards and refrigerator to show that some
basic supplies have been purchased.
54

55

35

JEAN
A few groceries to get you started.
Do you like it?

TOM
It’s nice.

They stand at the doorway to Tom’s new room. Neatly stacked
on the bed are brand new brightly colored school clothes and
supplies.

JEAN
We thought you could use some new
clothes for school.

The tour done, they file out the front door.

EXT. HORSE FARM, COTTAGE - DAY 54

The group stands in front of the house saying their good
byes. Mr. Walters takes a few photos on his phone.

MR. WALTERS
Tomorrow’ll be a full day. I’11
leave you two to get settled in.

Mr. Walters walks back to his house. Jean gets into her car.
Taking stock of their new circumstances, Will is distracted
by the satellite dish off to the side of the cottage.

INT. COTTAGE, KITCHEN - DAY 55
TOM
It feels good to be by ourselves
again.
Will opens a window and exhales out. Tom sits at the table.
WILL
I wish they could've just dropped
us on the road and let us be.
She brings him back to the here and now.
TOM

They made me take a lot of tests.
What about you?

WILL
Yes, they asked me a lot of
questions.

TOM

Like what?
A56

56

36

WILL
About us. 435 questions.
(pause)
It was hard not knowing how you
were. Did they treat you all right?

She nods.

WILL (CONT'D)
Let’s try to put it behind us.

Tom looks around the new surroundings. Will joins her at the
table.

TOM
Everything's different now.

WILL
What's different is that we’re ina
kind of house that most people are
comfortable with us living in.

He catches her eyes.

WILL (CONT'D)
But we can still think our own
thoughts.

He smiles at her. Will lifts the foil off a casserole that
was left for them, and then covers it back up.

TOM
I'll try it.
INT. COTTAGE, WILL’S ROOM - NIGHT A56

Will puts the TV into the closet.

INT. COTTAGE, WILL’S ROOM - NIGHT 56

Tom leans against the door of her dad’s room. She taps a
little rhythm on the door jam to see if he’s awake.

WILL
You can come in.

Tom enters the room and sits on the edge of the bed.

TOM
I can’t sleep.
57

37

WILL
Not since we left the park.

TOM
The sound of the wind in the trees
used to help me fall asleep.

Tom puts her face against the window, looking out.

She hears

WILL
There’s been something on my mind.

TOM
What is it?

WILL
They said a person saw you, and
that’s how they found our camp - is
this true?

TOM
I saw a man, but I didn’t think he
saw me.

WILL

Why didn’t you say something?

TOM
I was afraid to. I didn’t want to
leave our camp - it was such a good
one.

WILL
We stayed there too long.

a heavy sigh from Will.

TOM
Do you think you’1ll be OK here?

WILL
We’re gonna make the best of it.

INT. COTTAGE, KITCHEN - DAY 57

When Tom comes into the kitchen, she finds Will peering out
the window through the curtain.
38

TOM
Morning.
(pause)
What are you looking at?

WILL
I’m just looking. Good morning.

They eat cereal and orange juice. Tom eats hungrily. Will
looks anxious.

TOM
What’s the matter?

WILL
“To keep bright the Devil's
doorknobs and scour his tubs.
Better not to keep a house.”

Tom sighs.

TOM
Thoreau slept inside.

There’s a knock at the door. Will gets up to open the door.

MR. WALTERS
Good morning. Don’t mean to
interrupt your breakfast.

Will nods hello.

MR. WALTERS (CONT’D)
I know that you have particular
ways.

Will shifts his weight, trying to hide his exasperation with
Mr. Walters.

MR. WALTERS (CONT’D)
And I don’t want to disrupt.

WILL
What do you have planned for us
today?

MR. WALTERS
I was hoping you could help with
the tree work. Take the tractor and
get stumps out of the south field.

WILL
I’d rather not operate heavy
machinery. Is there any work with
the horses that I could do? Down in
the stables?
58

59

60

39

MR. WALTERS
Yes, but I’d rather you not work
down there yet. Working with horses
requires training. And that can
happen, but for now, I need help
elsewhere.

Will nods, complying.

MR. WALTERS (CONT’D)
Do you not know how? Or is it
something else?

There’s silence for a moment.

MR. WALTERS (CONT’D)
Listen, the work that really needs
doing is clearing that field.
That’s how I make my money.

WILL
Okay. Tractors, trucks, armored
vehicles -- whatever. I can operate
them all.
EXT. HORSE FARM - DAY 58

(Footage of Will’s labor to be used throughout his stay at
Walters’.)

Will is given his tools in the garage.

Will is working a long row of evergreens. He uses a tool to
shape and cut the trees evenly.

The land adjacent to Walters’ has recently been logged. In
the distance, Will can hear saws. He can hear the sound of a
helicopter overhead and looks up. (helicopter is sfx only)
INT./EXT. HORSE ARENA - DAY 59

KRYSS, a horse trainer does liberty training with her horse.

The horse runs the length of the arena and stops on a dime
before the arena gate.

Tom watches, peering over the arena wall.

INT. COTTAGE, WILL’S ROOM - NIGHT 60

Tom walks in to check on Will, who she can hear is having a
nightmare.
39A

He has sat up on the edge of the bed, his head in his hands
as he tries to re-stabilize. Tom sits down beside him.
61

62

40

She provides a gentle distraction.

TOM
If you could be any animal, what
would you be?

WILL
An owl.

TOM
Let’s look at the stars like we
used to do.

EXT. COTTAGE, PORCH - NIGHT 61

Tom and Will lie in blankets under the night’s sky, jammed
with stars. The leaves rustle. Will exhales.

INT. MR. WALTERS’ HOUSE, LAUNDRY RM - DAY 62
Tom stands next to the washing machine dropping clothes in.

MR. WALTERS
Different than doing laundry at
your special place in the stream, I
bet. Do you know how to use the
machine?

TOM
We went to the laundromat
sometimes, like when it was
raining.

Tom cuts off tags from the new bright clothes with her pocket
knife and adds them to the load. One pair of jeans has

fancy, glittery pockets, which she takes a moment to examine.
The way Mr. Walters is observing her makes Tom think she’s
supposed to narrate what she’s doing.

TOM (CONT'D)
These are school clothes. I’m just
getting ready.

MR. WALTERS
You'll finally get to spend some
time with kids your own age.
That’11 change you.

Tom pours some detergent into the machine. Mr. Walters hands
her a small bag.

MR. WALTERS (CONT’D)
I gathered from the newspaper that
you used to have a garden.
63

Tom looks inside the bag to find several packets of

TOM
Thank you.

Tom, interested in the article, wants to know more.

TOM (CONT'D)
Why did they want to write about
us?

MR. WALTERS
A lot of people like to imagine
themselves living like you guys
were, but not many actually do it.

41

seeds.

He fans through a pile of magazines and papers to find the
article and passes it to her. She looks it over and passes

the article back to him.
MR. WALTERS (CONT’D)
No, keep it. Your dad may want to
read it.

TOM
I don’t think so.

Mr. Walters shrugs.

EXT. HORSE FARM, COTTAGE - DAY

63

Mr. Walters stands nearby as Tom plants the seeds. She sets
the worms carefully aside and breaks up the clods with a

trowel.
Overhead, she hears a helicopter.

TOM
Lots of helicopters around here.

MR. WALTERS
Forestry mapping. Deciding where
to cut next.

Tom gets back to work putting the seeds in the soil.

MR. WALTERS (CONT’D)
This life here must seem pretty
easy. Hope it’s not too boring for
you.

TOM
It’s a person’s own fault if they
get bored.
64

42

She works in a very focused way, finishing the row.

TOM (CONT'D)
Okay. These turnips are all
planted.

MR. WALTERS
I'm interested in how you were
living before. Your father doesn’t
seem to want to talk about it.

TOM
What would you like to know?

MR. WALTERS
I guess I’m just curious how you
managed to make do with so little.
What would you have done if they
hadn't found you? Were you going
to just keep living there?

TOM
Yes. I think so. I have a
question for you.

MR. WALTERS
Shoot.

TOM
How come you’re all alone?

MR. WALTERS
I like the solitude, I guess.

TOM
You and my dad aren’t so different
then.

MR. WALTERS
That could be.

TOM
Except no one bothers you about it.

MR. WALTERS
That’s true.
EXT. HORSE FARM, SIDE ROAD - DAY 64
Tom walks along the edge of the farm following the fence that

stretches along the property. She finds a rabbit randomly
scampering in the middle of the gravel road. She picks it up
65

43

EXT. ISAIAH'S HOUSE - DAY 65
She walks into the adjoining yard.
She hears a boy’s voice calling out, “Chainsaw.”

ISAIAH, late teens, walks from a small half-built shed-like
structure in his yard and sees that Tom has the rabbit.

ISAIAH
Thanks.

TOM
You’re welcome.

Isaiah has a tool in his hand that Tom doesn’t recognize.

ISAIAH
When she sees these clippers, she
takes off.

He sits down on the platform, positions the rabbit like a
baby in his arms and attempts to clips its nails. The rabbit
squirms and wriggles.

ISAIAH (CONT'D)
Can you give me a hand -- hold her
feet? Like this.

He shows her. Tom helps restrain the rabbit.

TOM
Why do you cut its nails?

ISAIAH
So they look nice. The judges look
at the nails.

TOM
What judges?

ISAIAH
For the FFA show.

Tom can not figure out what he’s talking about. He can tell.

ISAIAH (CONT'D)
Future Farmers of America. It’s a
club for people who are interested
in raising animals. It’s like 4-H.
66

44

They continue clipping.

ISAIAH (CONT'D)
Some kids make fun of FFA, but it’s
one of the best parts of school for

me.
TOM
So you're gonna be a farmer in the
future?
ISAIAH

I don’t know yet.
He’s curious about her.

ISAIAH (CONT'D)
You go to school around here?

TOM
I will soon.

She wonders about the half-built structure they’re sitting
in.

TOM (CONT'D)
What are you building?

He puts down the rabbit on its mat and starts swiping through
images until he finds the one he’s looking for and shows her.

ISAIAH
I'd like to do something like that.

He puts down the phone and physically sketches out his idea.

ISAIAH (CONT'D)
Sleeping loft for me. Place for
her. Kitchen here. Even in a small
space like this, you can have
everything you need. You don’t
gotta be rich to have a tiny house.

TOM
Where’re you gonna put it?

ISAIAH
Maybe Colorado.

INT. ISAIAH'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY 66

Isaiah makes chocolate milk for them. Tom holds the rabbit.
She looks at the fridge door which has a collection of photos
of rabbits and kids with their chickens and goats. She
steals a look at Isaiah stirring. He offers her a glass of
the frothy milk and points to one of the photos.
67

45

ISAIAH
This is Chainsaw’s mother.
INT. ISAIAH’S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY 67

They stand at the counter drinking the milk with the rabbit
between them.

ISAIAH
If you like rabbits, you should
come to one of our meetings
sometime, if you want.
He muses.

ISAIAH (CONT'D)
Good rabbits, good kids.

She notices that it’s gotten late.
TOM
I gotta go. My dad’s not going to
know where I am.

He hands her his phone. She doesn’t take it.

TOM (CONT'D)
He doesn’t have one.

ISAIAH
The meetings are Wednesdays right
down this road, left on Rte 119.
The first place on the left.
EXT. HORSE FARM, COTTAGE - DUSK 68

Tom walks briskly away, cutting across the property to get to
the cottage, talking softly to herself.

TOM
Wednesdays, Rte 119, Wednesdays...

Tom can see Will inside the cottage looking out. She takes a
deep breath.

INT. COTTAGE, KITCHEN - NIGHT 69
There’s an awkward silence.

WILL
Where’ve you been?
45A

TOM
I met a kid who lives down the
road, and we were talking about
rabbits.
46

WILL
Why didn’t you tell me where you
were?

TOM

There was no time to tell you. It
was just happening.

Will walks to the window and looks out into the darkness.

TOM (CONT'D)
I’m sorry for making you worry
about me.

He looks off.

TOM (CONT'D)
If we had a phone, I could’ve
called you.

WILL
We've always been able to
communicate without all that.

Tom lets out a sigh and tries to be comforting.

TOM
I think we have to be able to
adapt.

She can see Will’s reflection in the window.

WILL
There’s no place on this farm where
we can’t be seen except for in this
house.

Will takes a seat at the table. Tom opens the fridge.
TOM
It’s impossible for them to be
watching us all the time.

Checking to see if he’s listening to her, she looks over at
him. He touches his beard and nods. Her own anxiety slips in.

TOM (CONT'D)
What if the kids at school think
I’m strange?
Beat. Will wonders what’s on her mind.

TOM (CONT'D)
Because of the way we were living?
70

47

WILL
How important are their judgements?

EXT. HORSE FARM, COTTAGE - DAY 70

Jean unloads the van, putting a few boxes and two bicycles
near the door of the cottage. She’s showing Tom the bikes
when Will walks up.

WILL
What’s all this about?

JEAN
These are things that got donated
to our agency.

WILL
We don’t need more things.

JEAN
Maybe you’1l find something you
can really use. What about the
bikes?

Jean looks at Tom.

JEAN (CONT'D)
Do you know how to ride?

Tom shakes her head no.

JEAN (CONT'D)
I’m sure your father can teach you.

Will nods, picks up one of the boxes, and walks it into the
house.

JEAN (CONT'D)
How are you feeling about this
place?

TOM
Good.

JEAN
I’m happy to see that you’re
adjusting. Tom, take a look at
these.

Jean opens the flap of one of the boxes. Inside the books are
packed tight.
71

GOLDENROD REVISED SCRIPT 48
JEAN (CONT'D)
Encyclopedias. Every single letter.
TOM
World Book. Mine were Brittanica.
Thank you.
Will hefts another box.
WILL
Thank you for bringing these -
we'll sort through them.

JEAN
Ok, great.

She hands Will a paper-clipped packet of papers.
JEAN (CONT'D)
This is the paperwork to enroll Tom
in school. Here’s the statute so
you can read it and understand it.

Will takes a deep breath, managing the overload of rules and
requirements.

JEAN (CONT'D)
Next visit, we can tackle the DMV.

Will has tensed up.

WILL
So soon?

JEAN
That’s one of the easier ones.

Will forces a smile.
JEAN (CONT'D)
I‘'1ll see you guys in a couple of
weeks.

Jean turns toward her car. Tom and Will watch her go.

EXT. 4-H CLUB MEETING - DAY 71
Tom is frozen for a moment, shy about walking into a group of
kids she’s never met. She takes a deep breath and heads over
to the gathering.

Isaiah introduces Tom to the members of the group.
72

49

The 4-H COACH wrangles the teens.

COACH
Let’s get started.

She leads the group in a health check on the rabbits. Ears,
fur, feet are checked. Tom stands next to Isaiah. He passes
the rabbit to her. He leans in to show her what to do.

Tom follows along. Her fingers burrow into the soft fur.
Standing there, she looks like a new member of their group.

INT. CHURCH - DAY 72

Tom and Will, both in church clothes, sit in a pew. The
MINISTER begins his sermon in a soothing tone.

MINISTER
We're all born with a void. That’s
why we're here -- to be with each
other and God. Otherwise, it is too
lonely.

Curious, Tom steals looks at a few people in her pew. Mr.
Walters is in front of them.

MINISTER (CONT'D)
Let me ask you this. What would you
do if you had a hundred sheep and
one of them wandered off? Wouldn’t
you leave the ninety-nine on the
hillside and go look for the one
that had wandered away? I’m sure
that finding him would make you
happier than having the ninety-nine
that never wandered off. That’s how
it is with the almighty, your
Father in heaven. He doesn’t want
any of his sheep to stray from the
flock. Matthew 18: 12-14,

A collection plate is passed down their row.

While the plate makes it down the pew, DEVOTIONAL DANCERS
with silk flags perform to a song.

Will hands Tom two singles to donate.

INT. CHURCH - DAY 73

After the service is over, Will follows the custom of
greeting and shaking hands with church members. Tom does the
same. Mr. Walters greets them warmly, looking very pleased to
have Tom and Will present.

As they near the exit, Tom takes brochures and literature
from the membership table.

EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY 74

Tom and Will ride their bikes home from church. The wind
therapy is invigorating. Will lets out a yelp as he flies
past Tom.

INT. COTTAGE, KITCHEN - DAY 75

Will is making sandwiches at the counter while Tom looks
through the brochures she collected from the church. She
opens one and reads it to her father.

TOM
“There are many ways to be involved
-music, devotional dance,
carpentry, camp, prayer group, rock
‘n roll, social media.

She looks at the next brochure.

TOM (CONT'D)
“Considering membership? Have you
read the Doctrinal Statement and
Core Values documents, and are you
willing to live by these
principles?”

She steals a look at Will, curious how he responds to these
questions.

TOM (CONT'D)
“Have you read the Bylaws and are
you submissive to the word of the
almighty as addressed in the By-
laws?”

He turns to face her.
WILL

Some people get comfort from church
and some people don’t.
51

He brings the sandwiches to the table and sits down.

TOM
So that’s why we went?

WILL
Walters asked us to go.
Appearances, unfortunately, count.
If we dress up and show up there on
Sunday, people believe certain
things about us.

TOM
Like what?

WILL
That we’re more like them and that
they understand us. And then they
don't ask too many questions.

TOM
Why’d you shake hands with people?

WILL
It’s the custom.

TOM
But maybe you could make a friend
with someone there?

WILL
Could be, but Church is not the
first place to find a friend.

TOM
I feel like I could make a real
friend at 4-H.

She studies him. Will bites into his sandwich.

TOM (CONT'D)
Are you growing your beard?

He touches his beard and nods. Tom peels an orange. Will
stirs his tea, and the clinking sound from his spoon is the
only sound in the room.
76

77

52

Will peels another orange in such a way that the skin comes
off in one long coil. She makes a different shape out of his
orange peel.

EXT. HORSE FARM, COTTAGE - DAY 76

Will and Jean are in the doorway of the cottage. Will passes
a cell phone back to Jean.

JEAN
OK, we can wait on that.

Tom approaches.

JEAN (CONT'D)
Here's the date for the appointment
with housing.

Jean passes Will another packet of papers, he glances at
them. Jean diverts her attention to Tom, and Will retreats
into the cottage.

Jean is happy to see Tom.

JEAN (CONT'D)
Hey there! I’ve heard you've been
busy.

Tom nods. Jean smiles.

TOM
Why’s my dad upset?

JEAN
He’s struggling with some of the
things he agreed to.

Jean sighs.

JEAN (CONT'D)
But he needs to follow through for
this to work and for you guys to
stay independent.

Wishing Jean could back off a little, Tom bites her tongue.
She sees her father walk away from the cottage.

INT. BARN - DAY 77

Will walks past a row of horses enclosed in stalls, stroking
their foreheads through the bars. A HORSE OWNER enters the
barn. Will, knowing that he’s not supposed to be there, hides
himself in the next stall, waiting to slip out.
78

A78

79

80

53

Through the bars he sees the owner trying to get a bit into
the horse’s mouth and thread the reins through the loop of
the bridle. The horse is bridle shy, doesn’t want to go on
the bit, and swings his head away.

The rider tethers the horse and steps out to get more gear.
Will is face to face with the horse whose mouth metal and
head gear clank against the bars. Will strokes his forehead
quickly and slips out.

INT. COTTAGE, WILL’S ROOM - NIGHT 78
Will sits on his bed looking out the window. (*He could also
lean against the post of the porch looking out - whatever's
easiest for schedule)

INT. COTTAGE, BATHROOM - MORNING A78

Will grooms his beard.

INT. COTTAGE, TOM’S ROOM —- MORNING 79

Will wakes Tom up. When she comes to, he puts her back pack
on the bed.

WILL
Pack up some of your things.

Tom is confused about what’s going on.

He walks out. She opens her dresser drawers, trying to decide
what to take. Will walks back into her room and hands her a
head lamp. She throws it into the pack.

WILL (CONT'D)
Don’t take anything you don’t need.

When Will walks out, Tom looks through the colorful donated
clothes and selects a shirt and hat. She tosses in a few of
the school supplies and buries them in the bottom of her
pack.

INT. COTTAGE, KITCHEN - MORNING 80

At the front door, Will puts on his old coat, leaving the
bright new coat he was given at social services on the hook.
He hands Tom her old coat. She puts her boots on, leaving the
sneakers. Will switches the lights on.
81

EXT. HORSE FARM, COTTAGE - MORNING

Leaving the cottage, they pass the bicycles leaning up
against the side of the house. She reaches for her bike.

WILL
No. We leave those here. They’re
not ours.

53A

81
82

83

84

54

They hurry along the road off Mr. Walter’s property.

EXT. FOREST PARK, ENTRANCE - DAY 82

Tom and Will slip into the park from the road.

EXT. FOREST PARK, ENCAMPMENT - DAY 83

They arrive at what remains of their old camp. Their site
has been ransacked. Will looks at the desolation marked off
with yellow “No Trespassing” tape.

Tom touches one of the encyclopedias strewn about, wet and
bloated. The catchment is partially down and spilled over.
The cache buckets are open and empty. The garden is wilted
and uprooted.

EXT. FOREST PARK — DAY 84

A distance from their old site, Will reaches up into a hollow
and takes out knives in a ziplock. He extends the small
scissors that fold out of the pocket knife.

WILL
We need to cut your hair short.

TOM
Why?

WILL
So you'll look different.

TOM
Can we wait til we get some real
scissors?

WILL
Check, but keep wearing your hat.

TOM
When are we going back?

WILL
We're not.

TOM
I liked it there. Did you really
give it a try?

WILL
We did.
54A

TOM
Did you?
85

55

WILL
Our choices about how we want to
live were being taken away one by
one.

He takes a moment.

WILL (CONT'D)
They would have separated us
eventually, if we didn’t follow
their rules.

Hearing her dad say this makes her feel sad. She drops the
conversation.

Will takes out some sandwiches from his backpack and they
eat. He’s got the map of Forest Park laid out in front of
them.

TOM
Won’t he notice that we’re gone?

WILL
With luck, not til tomorrow.

TOM
Where’re we going?

Tom studies the map with him.

TOM (CONT'D)
If we find a good place really deep
in, do you think they’1l find us
again?

He’s really not sure what to do. He picks up his pack,
heaves it onto his back, and they walk on.

EXT. FOREST PARK, MEN’S CAMP —- DAY 85

Will and Tom approach the men’s camp, which is deserted too.
They walk a little further and see Larry.

LARRY
You can’t stay here with her. Now,
no one can. It’s been hot since
they picked you up. Services lit a
fire under the rangers asses. And
they've finally caught up with me.
86

87

56

Larry looks at the dozer.

WILL
What about on the other side of the
ravine?

Larry shakes his head, no good.

LARRY
They're patrolling everywhere.
There’s no place they don’t look
for you.

The bull dozer sound escalates with the crushing of Larry's
belongings. Will and Tom look at what Larry is watching: the
dozer shoves his structure down.

LARRY (CONT'D)
(shouting over the dozer)
That’s all I’ve got.

Tom looks at the shelter collapsing then back at Larry’s
face.

LARRY (CONT'D)

I've gotta find a forest where they
can’t find me.

EXT. PORTLAND STREET - DAY 86
Tom and Will walk in an industrial zone, under a bridge with
the freeway towering above them.

EXT. TRAIN YARD - DAY 87
Looking through a chain link fence at the train yard, Tom
glances at a “No Trespassing” sign, anxious that they’re
going where they shouldn't.

TOM
What’re we doing here?

WILL
Looking for a train that can take
us out of town.

TOM
Have you ever done this before?

Tom reluctantly follows him.
88

89

57

On the tracks are more signs: Do Not Enter, Authorized
personnel only, Danger. She notices how nervous Will
appears, as he constantly looks around.

INT. TRAIN CAR - DAY 88

They move back in the car and sit crouched with their packs
against the back wall. They hear the trains around them
moving on different tracks. Tom’s hand grazes over some
glass shards on the floor. She winces and wraps her finger in
her sweatshirt. Will sees what’s happened.

WILL
Let me see it.

He looks at her hand, roots through his bag, and pulls out a
band-aid.

He wraps it around her finger.

The sound of wheels squeaking on the neighboring track is
piercing. Their car hasn’t moved yet.

TOM
Why’re we doing this?

WILL
To save our money for food.

The yard is quiet for a moment. Exhausted, they wait. A
freight goes by on the upper track. A cop siren and bull
horn break the silence. It’s an announcement directed at
unauthorized people spotted on the tracks.

TOM
Please, Dad, let’s go. We shouldn’t
be here.
WILL
You're right. This is an unlucky
train.
EXT. BUS STATION - DAY 89

Tom stands in an outdoor waiting area at the entrance of the
bus station.

Will comes over to Tom and gives her a ticket, and reminds
her of the drill.
58

WILL
Get in line when they call the bus.

Will looks around.

TOM
When you look around like that, you
look nervous.

He acknowledges this and heads back toward the waiting area.

Tom gets a book out of her pack. She moves back into the
covered portico that stretches along the front of the
station. She sits on a bench next to a WOMAN PASSENGER, old
enough to be her mother, who’s reading from a tablet while
waiting.
90

91

59

Some bus departures are announced.

EXT. BUS STATION - DAY 90

From across the street, Valerie, the girl from social
services spots Tom and heads over. They’re both surprised.

VALERIE
You guys aren’t on that ranch
anymore?
Tom is caught out. Valerie senses she’s nervous.

VALERIE (CONT'D)
I swear I’m not gonna tell anyone.

Valerie looks around for Will.

VALERIE (CONT'D)
Are you still with your dad?

TOM
Yeah.

VALERIE
Are you guys gonna hide out in the
woods again?

TOM
I don’t know.

Silence. The bus is called. Valerie gives her a hug. Will
glances back to check on Tom from the line.

She heads over to the bus.

INT. BUS - DAY 91

Tom walks up the aisle staying close behind the woman from
the station and sits next to her on the bus. Will sits in the
back.

A TEEN GIRL, 14, with a roller bag heads down the aisle and
takes a seat a couple of rows in front of Tom.

Tom glances at the man across the aisle whose phone is making
noise.

A plain clothes DETECTIVE, 30s, approaches the girl. Tom
leans a little closer to the woman. The detective moves in on
the teen traveler.
5S9A

DETECTIVE
Hey, how’s it going?
He pulls a badge hanging around his neck from under his
shirt. The girl looks nervous.
DETECTIVE (CONT'D)
You traveling alone?
Tom doesn’t dare look up and turns a little more toward the
woman next to her.
TEEN GIRL TRAVELER
Yes. I’m 18.
DETECTIVE
Do you have some ID?
TEEN GIRL TRAVELER
Not on me.
DETECTIVE
Is there someone who can verify
your age?
The girl looks around quickly trying to think of some way
out.

DETECTIVE (CONT'D)
You gotta come with me so we can
look into your situation.

The detective leads her away. Tom steals a look.
92

93

60

Tom’s attention turns back to the man swiping through
numerous photos. He takes selfies. Will notices all the photo
action.

INT. BUS - DAY 92

When the woman is asleep, Tom gets up and heads back to where
Will is sitting.

Tom sits down next to her father.

WILL
What’re you doing?

TOM
I missed you. No one’s looking at
us right now.

The Valerie encounter weighs heavy on her.
TOM (CONT'D)
Just before I got on the bus, I ran
into the girl I met at services.
She swore she won't say anything
about seeing us.

Hearing this, Will is anxious, but tries to rein it in.

INT. BUS - DAY 93

Tom has fallen asleep on his shoulder. He puts his arm around
her.
94

95

96

61

INT./EXT. BUS - DUSK 94
The bus pulls into a stop, and there’s an announcement on the
bus PA system: “Be back on the bus in 10 minutes.”

OMIT 95

INT. TRUCK STOP, MARKET PLACE - NIGHT 96

In the snack lounge, Tom waits for Will near a blinking
vending machine.

Anxious that they’1l miss the bus, she looks out the glass
door.

She speaks through the bathroom door to Will.

TOM
Dad, the bus is gonna leave.

She sees the bus pull away.
Will comes out of the bathroom.

WILL
We're not getting back on.

He tries to drop it, but can’t.
WILL (CONT'D)
Was the woman on the bus asking
you anything?
TOM
Nothing. She barely noticed me. She
was doing things with her phone.
WILL
And the girl at the station - she
mighta seen what bus we were on.
Tom looks down, nods no, avoiding him.

TOM
This isn't the way we used to be.

Will swallows hard.
61A

WILL
We can’t take any chances.
97

98

62

EXT. TRUCK STOP, PARKING AREA - NIGHT 97
Tom hangs back on the curb of the lot. From where she stands
amid the din of CB radio, police scanner static, and engine
noise, she can see a SECURITY GUARD doing his rounds,
listening into an earbud. Will approaches an 18 wheeler
where the DRIVER is standing outside of his cab.
WILL
Any chance you could give us a lift
-- me and my daughter?
The driver glances over at Tom, noting her age.
DRIVER 1
(0.S.)
I don’t get involved with this
stuff.

Will quickly moves away.

EXT. TRUCK STOP, PARKING AREA - NIGHT 98

Will approaches another truck where the DRIVER is climbing
back into his cab.

WILL
Hi there.

TRUCK DRIVER 2
What can I do for you?

WILL
We broke down. Any chance you
could take us up the road a bit?

The driver quickly takes stock of Will. He leans in, coming
closer to Tom to address her directly.

TRUCK DRIVER 2
Everything OK here?

Tom nods.

TRUCK DRIVER 2 (CONT’D)
Let me talk to the kid a minute.

Will takes a step back.
The driver leans so that their backs are to Will.

TRUCK DRIVER 2 (CONT’D)
If you’re in trouble here -

She spells it out in the most sincere way she can.
63

TOM
My dad and I just really need a
ride.

The driver takes a hard look at Tom, who shows no signs of

distress.
TRUCK DRIVER 2
I just wanna know that I’m doin’
the right thing. Hop in.
WILL
Thanks, man.
99 INT. TRUCK, PARKED - NIGHT 99

The truck is neatly organized. The driver’s sleeping area is
comfortable and decorated with a nature scene painted on
velvet. On the driver’s bed is a little dog.

TRUCK DRIVER 2
The kid can ride back there. Willie
Nelson’s really friendly - ain’t
you, Willie?

Tom crawls to the sleeping cabin. Will settles in shotgun.

The driver puts on some music. Tom pets the dog who’s rested
its head on her. The truck pulls out.

[insert shot of night road for passage of time]

100 INT. TRUCK - DAY 100

The truck has left the highway and is climbing up a two lane
road in the mountains. The driver listens to the news on the
radio.

Tom has fallen asleep. Will looks out the window.

They pass a clear cut area and imposing power line towers.
The driver shakes his head slightly at the news.

TRUCK DRIVER 2
Seeing you and your daughter
reminds me of me and my daughter. I
used to take her camping up here.
We used to have a little place back
in there. Not no more.

101 INT. TRUCK - DAY 101

The first sign of open Wilderness is visible from the window.
102

64
TRUCK DRIVER 2
We just crossed into Washington.
Will registers this.

TRUCK DRIVER 2 (CONT’D)
Where’d you say you were headed?

WILL
Not too far from here.

After a few more curves ahead, Will sees an old logging road.
WILL (CONT'D)
We're up near that next bend.
Anywhere you’re able to pull over.

He’s concerned.

DRIVER
You sure? Here?

Will nods. The driver looks for a spot to pull the truck
over.

Will turns around to talk to Tom.

WILL
Sweetie, we’re here. We’ve gotta
get out.
EXT. FOREST ROAD - DAY 102

They get out of the truck.

WILL
Thanks, much.

The driver toots the horn and pulls away.
Tom and Will put their packs on.

TOM
It feels a lot colder.

WILL
It’s the altitude.

Will tries to orient himself with the map. Tom adds a layer
of clothes. Will does the same.
65

103 EXT. FOREST, LOGGING PATH - DAY 103

Will leads the way along the path. Tom is lagging behind,
tired. He checks on her.

WILL
It’s important to keep up the pace,
or we'll get even colder.
TOM
I’m trying! My feet are really
stinging.
He roots through his pack and gets out dry socks.

WILL
My feet are stinging, too.

They sit down on a log to change socks. He guides Tom’s feet
under his shirt to warm them up.

They put on the dry socks. Will wraps plastic bags around her
feet. She struggles to get her boots back on.

They look around trying to get their bearings as to what
direction to choose, but it all looks the same.

Tom fixes on some power lines.
TOM
Do you see any power lines?
The’d lead us somewhere. Wouldn’t
they be connected to houses?
WILL
They could, or they might just go
up and over the mountain.
Tom looks around for any other signs of where to go.

TOM
What do you think we should do?

WILL
Keep moving.
104 EXT. FOREST - DAY 104
They resume walking.

TOM
I can’t bend my fingers.
105

66

He gestures for her to put her hands in her arm pits.
WILL
It can happen quickly. That’s why
we've got to keep moving.
He puts out his hand to tug her along.

He hands the last of their water to her. She takes a few sips
and passes the bottle back to him.

WILL (CONT'D)
You need it. It’s important to
drink. Finish the rest.

She takes a few more sips.

In the distance, they see that the power lines just keep
going and won’t lead them anywhere.

TOM
Dad, my legs are stiff.

She looks to him for help.
TOM (CONT'D)
What are we looking for? Have you
ever been here?

WILL
Not to this exact place.

The fact that he had no specific location hits her hard.
TOM
There’s no cabin?
EXT. FOREST - DAY 105
Will sets down his pack. Adrenaline is coursing through. He
looks behind them and into the void ahead, trying to decide

how to gamble.

TOM
I can’t feel my feet.

He follows his gut about which choice gives them a better
chance of surviving.

WILL
Collect branches.

Tom, so stiff that she can only move slowly, collects
branches and boughs. Will drags over a large fallen branch.
66A

Will props one end of the branch against a stump, creating a
spine for a structure. He then starts leaning branches and
sticks against the spine.
106

67

WILL (CONT'D)
Keep adding to this.

He drags another bough from a fallen tree, breaking off
pieces with his foot. He shows Tom how to layer the boughs
over the sticks to create the debris shelter. He cuts sword
fern branches with his knife and gives them to Tom to layer
on.

WILL (CONT'D)
Line the bottom. We can’t let the
moisture reach us.

She's adding pine needles. He tosses her some cedar. She
doesn’t take it.

WILL (CONT'D)
Use cedar for that.

TOM
What does it matter?

WILL
It matters. Cedar keeps back the
moisture.

She stops moving. He wraps her in a mylar rescue blanket
that’s been in his pack since the park days.

They change into dry pants, adding whatever layers they can.
He starts to stuff debris into his coat -- his sleeves, his
hat. He puts some in her hat and passes a bundle for the
inside of her coat.

Will gathers moss and squeezes it tightly to get some drops
of water. Squeezing it takes all his strength. He drips
water into Tom’s mouth.

She climbs into the shelter. From inside, they cover the
opening with boughs and sticks.

EXT. SURVIVAL SHELTER - NIGHT 106
107

108

109

68

WILL
Still stinging?

TOM
Yes.

WILL
In the morning, we’ll have water.

She doesn’t answer.
WILL (CONT'D)

Tomorrow, we'll have light, we’ll
find our place.

TOM
Are we going to freeze in our
sleep?

WILL

No, you'll wake up if you get too
cold. We’ll get through this.
EXT. FOREST, SURVIVAL SHELTER - MORNING 107

The shelter is illuminated by the light of morning. It is
utterly still in the forest.

WILL
Clicking noise
(Are you still here?)
She clicks back (Yes).

They crawl out of the shelter.

EXT. FOREST, SURVIVAL SHELTER - DAY 108

Nearby, Will gets more moist moss and they each get a few
drops. They set off from the debris shelter, trudging
stiffly.

EXT. FOREST, CABIN - DAY 109
Tom is the first to spot a structure up ahead. A hundred feet

closer, and they can see that it’s a small rustic cabin. Will
mutters words of thanks to himself.
A110

69
Tom picks up the pace. The remaining adrenalin in her body
kicks in, and she makes it to the door first.
Will pries the latch off the door frame carefully using a
rusted metal bar on the porch shelf.
INT. CABIN - DAY 110
The cabin is bare bones. Wood walls, simple furniture, wood
stove. Tom sees some children’s books and games on a shelf

near a small couch.

Tom investigates a photo on the fridge of the family who owns
the cabin.

He turns on the faucets. No water comes out.

EXT. CABIN - DAY A110

Will looks at the power source for the cabin. Solar
batteries, long drained, encrusted with nature debris.

INT. CABIN - DAY 111

Will lights a fire in the stove. When it catches, he twirls
Tom into a wool blanket. Once Tom is in one blanket, Will
wraps a second one around her. She’s so tightly wrapped that
he props her onto the sofa.

He moves her closer to the fire to warm her feet. They watch
the flames.

WILL
Any better?
TOM
Tingling, throbbing.
Will nods.
WILL
That’s what happens when they warm
back up.
TOM

What about you?

WILL
Mostly OK.
69A

INT. CABIN - NIGHT 112

He takes out the three cans of soup in the kitchen cabinet
and heats one up.

Tom can see that he’s limping a little. Will draws the
curtains and lights a few candles.
70

They sit at the table eating the soup. While Will looks at a
map, Tom puts her hand over the flame until it’s too hot to
keep there. Will gets up to check the map that’s on the wall.

Will nods,

WILL
(tracing route with his finger)
Cut across this ridge here, and if
not, hitch from the road.

TOM
I wish we could just stay here for
a while.

WILL

We need provisions.

TOM
This is kind of perfect.

appreciating the remote, cosy tranquility.

TOM (CONT'D)
Maybe we can build ourselves a
place like this.

WILL
Need to own a little land.

TOM
What about a small house that’s in
a tree? We wouldn’t need land for
that. We’d just need one tree.

Will smiles at the rare moment when he is amused by her kid
logic. He keeps the optimistic planning going.

WILL
In the Spring we can find a place
where nobody will bother us.

Will double checks the cabinets to see if they’ve missed any
food supply. He reaches to the back of a cabinet turning up
only condiments.

TOM
Do you miss the things we had back
at the farm?

WILL
Those were never really our things.
114

71

INT. CABIN - NIGHT 113
Will looks over and sees that Tom has already fallen asleep.
He finally looks relieved. He sits on the chair across from
her. Even though he knows she can’t hear him, he whispers to
her.

WILL
Sleep tight, Yellow.

He blows out the candle.

INT. CABIN - MORNING 114
The two remaining cans of soup are on the counter.

WILL
Which one do you want first?

TOM
Minestrone.

They make a shopping list together.

WILL
What am I missing?

He passes the list to her, and she writes down a few items.

TOM
Beans. Noodles.

She draws a big mushroom on the list. He smiles.

Tom brings over a wool sweater for Will to layer under his
coat. He bundles up to leave. She hands him some socks.

Tom gives him a hug.
TOM (CONT'D)
Dad, you’re sure I shouldn’t come
with you?

He puts the socks in his pocket.
72

WILL
No, it’s important for you to let
your feet recover.

TOM
What about yours?

WILL
They're fine.

TOM
But you’re still limping.

WILL
Bad blister can do that.

She looks at him, wondering if he’s leveling with her.
Will hands Tom a debit card.

WILL (CONT'D)
Do you remember the code?

TOM
Yes.

From the window, Tom can see Will walk away from the cabin.

INT. CABIN - DUSK 115

Tom spends a lonely night in the cabin. She opens the last
can of soup, and cooks half of it. The wind rattles the
cabin. She looks out the window.

INT. CABIN - NIGHT 116

Tom draws the curtains, lights a candle, and settles in to
wait for her dad.

She gets up and opens the curtains. She looks at the map on
the wall of the cabin, seeing in detail the ridges and
passes. She sits back in the chair. Waiting.

INT. CABIN - DAY 117
Tom cooks the second half of the can of soup. She cleans her

blistered toes, wrapping them in gauze. She puts on two pairs
of socks and her shoes.
120

73

She ties a rope to a small metal pot on one end and a
colorful patterned table cloth on the other.

EXT. FOREST, CABIN - DAY 118

Tom surveys the land around the cabin, trying to see which

direction Will might be coming from. She decides on a tree

that stands alone from the others and attempts to throw the
metal pot over a branch so it will catch the tablecloth in

the tree. After two attempts, the object flies high enough
for the cloth to get snagged in the tree.

She stands back wondering how far away the colorful, waving
fabric can be seen. She shifts from foot to foot trying to
keep warm. Branches creak, the wind stirs, no sign of Will.

She heads back to the cabin.

INT. CABIN - DAY 119

With no soup left, Tom stands on the counter and looks into
the very back of the highest cabinet shelves to see if they
might have missed something. She finds nothing edible.

She opens the lower cabinets. On her hands and knees she
almost crawls inside. From the way back, she pulls out a box
of pancake mix. There’s only a little in the box, and she
taps out every drop and adds water. When she pours it into
the skillet, it makes one large pancake.

She eats the pancake slowly.

INT. CABIN - DAY 120
Tom stuffs her clothes into her pack.

She walks over to a pile of Will’s belongings, things he'd
removed from his pack when he set off across the ridge.

She is hesitant to touch an envelope that is filled with
documents, but peers in, decides it is important.

From the things he left behind, she takes the pouch of
documents, his notebook, a well worn map of Forest Park.

When she looks again inside the pouch, she finds a snap shot
of Will, her mother, and herself as a baby. There’s another

photo of a soldier in a hospital, one of a soldier in dress

uniform, and a newspaper article.
121

122

123

74

She finds a couple of her drawings, along with poems and
passages that he’s torn out from books and folded into his
sketch book. She opens a folded page taken from the Iliad.

TOM

(reading the page)
Achilles went on grieving for his
friend, whom he could not banish
from his mind. Sleep refused to
visit him. He tossed to one side
and the other, thinking always of
his loss...As memories crowded in
on him, the warm tears poured down
his cheeks.

She finds a little plastic capsule with some small teeth
inside. A folded paper has been inserted with the teeth.

TOM (CONT'D)
(reading the note)
Tom’s baby teeth.
She looks at the objects, holding back tears.

Tom lights every candle in the cabin.

EXT. FOREST, CABIN - NIGHT 121

On the front railing of the porch, she drips wax and lines
the candles up. She yells as loudly as she can.

TOM
DAD!

She waits. She hears the wind in the trees and the spitting
of the candle flames.

She goes back inside and stands at the window, looking out.

INT. CABIN - DAY 122

Tom tidies up the cabin, leaving it in good shape. She
bundles back up, putting on layers.

EXT. FOREST, ACCIDENT SITE - DAY 123

Tom walks deep into the woods, looking for tracks.
Periodically, she stops to listen for sounds.

In the distance, she hears an engine sound and quickens her
pace in that direction. As she nears the edge of a ravine, a
spot of color catches her eye. She sees her father at the
bottom. She scrambles down the ravine to where he lies.
124

75

TOM
Dad?

No answer. She swallows hard.

TOM (CONT'D)
Dad?

She runs over to him and shakes him gently. He’s slightly
responsive, not fully conscious, but still breathing. She
runs her fingers across his forehead, which is scraped and
smeared with dried blood.

TOM (CONT'D)
Oh, Dad.

She puts her hands on his face, trying to warm him.

She hears the engines again, but they stop before she can
figure out what direction they’re coming from.

TOM (CONT'D)
Someone’s in these woods. I heard
engines before.

Tom opens her pack and layers the remaining garments over her
father. She puts water to his lips. She stows the water
bottle inside his sweater. She opens her father’s pack and
sees that he had gotten their provisions.

She holds her father tight.

TOM (CONT'D)
I’m getting us some help.

Will nods. She walks away, backing up, afraid to turn her
back on him.

Tom turns to concentrate on where she should be heading, but
she finally breaks down. She leans against a tree wiping
stinging tears from her chapped cheeks.

She doesn’t know which way to walk. She turns 360, waiting
for the sound again.

The engines resume; she moves as fast as she can. She can
hear human voices, music, and the engines.

EXT. FOREST, ATV SITE - DAY 124
As she gets closer to the sound, she sees that it’s coming

from two TEENAGERS, who are horsing around on ATVs. At
first, no one notices her.
76

Tom runs into their path to get their attention. One of the
drivers, COLIN, 18, notices her. He’s surprised to see
someone just appear, stops immediately, and cuts his engine.

TOM
I need some help.
COLIN
What’s wrong?
TOM
My dad’s hurt. I need help carrying

him.
Colin nods for her to get on the ATV.

TOM (CONT'D)
I came from that direction.

Tom points the way.

COLIN
You gotta hold on.

She puts her arms around him. They drive into the woods and
Colin’s friend follows.
125 EXT. FOREST, ACCIDENT SITE - DAY 125

It’s not clear if Will is still alive. The two teens are
suddenly scared.

Tom approaches Will, whispering softly.

TOM
Dad, we’re going.

Will nods slightly.

The two boys help Tom roll the stump off of Will and load him

onto the ATV. They tie Will to Colin so he won’t fall off.
126 EXT. FOREST - DAY 126

Tom holds Will in place on the ATV. Colin drives carefully.

127 EXT. DALE’S HOUSE - DAY 127

The teens pull into a gravel driveway which leads up to a
cabin. The lights are on inside.
128

77

COLIN
This is the only place anywhere
near here.

Tom knocks. The door is answered by DALE, a middle-age woman
in Carharts.

TOM
I need some help.

Dale looks over to Colin, who she recognizes as a local kid.

DALE
They friends of yours?

Colin shrugs and shakes his head. Dale gestures for them to
bring Will in.

INT/EXT. DALE'S HOUSE - DAY 128

Will is laid onto a couch. Colin and his friend back their
way to the door.

DALE
Tell me what happened.

TOM
His leg’s hurt. He was lost for
three days. He fell somehow.

DALE
He’s gotta get to a hospital.

Dale picks up her phone, poised to dial.

TOM
Can anyone from here help?

DALE
They’1l treat him even if you don’t
have money.

TOM
He doesn’t like people to ask lots
of questions.

DALE
His leg is messed up bad. What
kind of trouble are you in?

TOM
We're not in trouble. Can we just
take care of it ourselves?
129

130

78

Dale steps out onto her porch, dials, and talks to someone.
Tom can’t hear what’s she’s saying.

INT. DALE’S HOUSE - DAY 129
BLANE, 40s, a former marine corpsman, begins to triage Will.

He gestures for Dale to take Tom out of the room, so he can
get to work.

When Blane lays his hands on Will to examine the injury, the
touch jolts Will into awareness. He catches Blane’s eyes, but
quickly turns away.

BLANE
Let me help you, brother.

Will nods slightly. Blane does a procedure to check Will’s
head injury, using a light to look into his eyes.
EXT. DALE’S HOUSE, PORCH - DAY 130

DALE
What happened out there?

TOM
We got lost.

Dale’s not sure what that means.

DALE
Where were you guys headed?

TOM
I don’t think we knew where we were
going.
131

79

DALE
Where is your home?

TOM
With my dad.

Dale wants to follow up with more questions, but she’s
interrupted by Blane who comes into the kitchen to update
them.

BLANE
He’s splinted and taped up. It’s
gonna knit back, but it’1ll take
time. He might’ve lost some
function in his toes, but
everything’s clean.

Tom steals a look at Dale to see how she’s taking it all in.
BLANE (CONT'D)
He’s drowsy from what I gave him.
But try to get more food in him,
when you can.
Blane looks to Tom, and then hands Dale some pills.

BLANE (CONT'D)
For pain.

Dale gives him a hug. He smiles at Tom.

BLANE (CONT'D)
I’1l come back and check on him.

TOM
Thank you.
Blane leaves.
INT. DALE'S HOUSE - NIGHT 131

Dale is wrestling with a rolling cot. Tom helps her pull it
into the main room.

DALE
I trust you, but there’s other
people here that might not. If your
Dad's in some kinda trouble, I need
you to tell me ‘cuz folks here are
not lookin’ to get mixed up in
somethin’.

Dale looks Tom in the eye. Tom shakes her head no.
132

133

134

135

80

INT. DALE'S HOUSE - NIGHT 132
Dale and Tom cover Will. Tom squeezes Will’s hand.

They unfold the cot so it’s next to the sofa where Will lies.
They make the bed.

Tom gets into her cot. Will shifts position and becomes aware
of her next to him. He speaks softly; the words are stuck in
his throat.

WILL
So sorry.

She can hear that he’s choked up. He tries to say more. She
spares them the agony of vocalizing his regret.

TOM
I know you are.

They lie silently, neither knowing what to say.

EXT. DALE’S PROPERTY - MORNING 133
She looks around the property to get a sense of where they’ve
landed. She sees several RVs set up in a long-term way --

little yards, clothes line, chimes. One RV has colored
crates stacked off to the side.

EXT. REMOTE RV - DAY 136

As Dale and Tom approach the remote RV, Dale double checks
that Tom prefers the remote RV over the others.

DALE
I’ve got the other RVs up the hill,
one has a little yard --

TOM
No, this is good. My dad will like
this one.

DALE

He’s gonna need a while to recover.

TOM
We won’t be in your way here.

Dale looks Tom in the eye, trying to figure out who these two
travelers are. Tom returns her gaze calmly and honestly.
Behind them, a small Bobcat dozer, driven by ANDY, Dale’s
partner, bobs down the hill transporting a mattress.

OMIT 137
INT. REMOTE RV - DAY 138
There are two small rooms -- a general living space and a

small bedroom in the back. They set Will up in the back,
propping up his leg on a pillow. Will steals a look at Dale.
139

82

DALE
(to Tom)
You know where to find me.

WILL
We won’t be here long. Thank you.

DALE
It’s not a problem.

Dale smiles at them as she leaves.

Tom sits on the edge of Will’s bed. From the RV’s window, she
observes a bird working on its nest.

EXT. SUSAN’S DWELLING - DAY 139

Tom ventures over to the stacked colored crates. She watches
SUSAN, the woman she had noticed before.

SUSAN
Have you ever seen inside a bee
hive?
Tom stays trained on what he’s doing -- using a smoking can

to spread smoke around one of the crates.

TOM
Can I look inside?

She hands Tom a veil to put over her head. Susan opens one of
the hives so she can look inside. She adds more smoke so they
can inspect the colony.

SUSAN
First important thing to know --
bees don’t get aggressive unless
they think their hive is being
invaded.

Susan allows the bees to land on her.

SUSAN (CONT'D)
They're just waking up. This queen
I’ve got now, this is her third
year, and she’s going strong.
140

141

83

TOM
Can I help?

Susan hands her the smoker.

OMIT 140

INT. REMOTE RV, WILL’S ROOM - DAY 141

Tom checks on Will who’s looking out the window. She enters
his room with two cups of tea and the jar of honey. She hands
a cup to Will.

TOM
Dad, there's some interesting
things in this place.

WILL
Like what, for example?

TOM
There’s a beekeeper who lives here.

She catches his eye. She lifts the jar of honey.

TOM (CONT'D)
This is from the bees, from right
here. When you can walk, I wanna
show you.

Will manages to lift his leg a little. After a second, he
puts it down.

TOM (CONT'D)
It’ll take a little while, Dad.

Will sighs. His mind races ahead.
WILL

What have you told these folks
about us?

TOM
Not a lot. They haven’t asked me
much.

WILL

What have they asked you?

TOM
Dale asked me if we’re in trouble.
I said no. We’re not, right?
142

84

Will uses his arms to try again to lift his leg.

WILL
Do you think they called anyone?

TOM
Called who?

WILL
People who will try to move us
somewhere.

TOM
I don’t think they’d do that here.

WILL
What makes you say that?

TOM
It's a feeling I get.

Sitting on the edge of her father’s bed, she lifts the honey
jar off the window sill and adds a spoonful to her tea. She
dips the spoon again and turns to Will.

TOM (CONT'D)
Want to try it?

WILL
Yes.

She drizzles a long strand of honey into his cup.

EXT. DALE’S CABIN - DAY 142

Tom heads over toward Dale’s. Blane is in the yard with his
dog, Hector. They greet Tom warmly.

BLANE
How’s he doing?

TOM
He’s trying to get up on the
crutches.

BLANE
Takes time.

Tom seizes the opportunity to talk about her dad to someone
who she senses won’t use it against them.

TOM
He wants to leave.

Blane nods, understanding. He runs his hand over Hector’s
head and brings him closer.
143

144

145

85

BLANE
This is Hector. He’s helped me a
lot.

Tom reaches out to the dog, who lets her pet him.
BLANE (CONT'D)
You wanna take him for a couple of
days?

Blane puts his arms out and Hector balances on his hind legs
so Blane can hug him. He lets Hector jump back to all fours.

BLANE (CONT'D)
I think your dad might like having
him around. Let him sleep in your
dad’s room.

Tom looks at him curiously.

BLANE (CONT'D)
Hector can nudge him so he can come
out of the dream. He does that for
me.

Hector buries his snout in Blane’s hand.

INT. REMOTE RV - DAY 143

Tom brings the dog inside the RV. She lets Hector pad his way
into Will’s room.

TOM
Dad, that’s Hector. Blane asked if
we could watch him for a few days.
Hector has rested his snout on Will’s bed, looking at Will
with raised eyebrows. Will can not resist looking into the
dog's eyes. He puts his hand out, and Hector licks it.

Tom steals a glance at her dad relating to the dog and
smiles, feeling relieved for the first time in a long while.

She puts food in Hector’s bowl and heads out.
OMIT 144
EXT. DALE’S CABIN - DAY 145

Tom and Dale are at the trunk of Dale’s car unloading
groceries. Tom carries one of the bags to the porch.
86

Tom has something she wants to say to Dale. Finally, she just
blurts it out as she pulls some folded cash from her pocket.

TOM
This is what I’ve got left. We
want to stay.

She shows Dale the money in her hand. Dale pushes the money
back to Tom.

DALE
You’re welcome to stay down there
til your dad gets better. If you
guys were to be here for a long
time, it costs something to stay on
-- for propane, water, things like
that.

TOM
So is this enough?

DALE
I don’t need to take your money
right now.

TOM
We want to stay a long time.

Tom tries again. Dale takes a symbolic few bills.

DALE
I can take this as a deposit.
(assuring her)
I’m not gonna rent the place out
from under you. Take a deep
breath. You can stay.

TOM
I like living here.

Tom leans into the trunk to get another grocery bag. Dale is
stuffing some of the cans she bought into a canvas bag. When
the bag is full, she ties it shut and rolls it into a forest
patterned tarp.

TOM (CONT'D)
What’s that for?

DALE
I leave this out for someone who
lives up in the peninsula. I
haven't seen him in years, but I
know he gets the food. When I come
back to check, the bag’s always
empty. I know he appreciates it.
146

87

EXT. DALE’S PROPERTY - DAY 146

Tom watches as Dale stands on a stump and wedges the bag into
the branches of the tree.

DALE
It’s been the same spot for years.

She pats the tree.

INT. REMOTE RV - DAY 147

Tom takes mushrooms out of a grocery bag and then out of
their shrink wrapped plastic container. While they cook, she
looks in on her father, who’s got their map laid out on his
bed.

TOM
Are you hungry?

WILL
Yes.

Will comes out of his room on the crutches. Tom is surprised
to see him up.

TOM
You're up!

WILL
Been practicing.

He swings his leg around to sit at the table.

Tom serves them each a plate of mushrooms. Will digs in, and
smiles at her, relishing the mushrooms. Tom is preoccupied.

TOM
I want to tell you something.

WILL
Please do.

TOM
I paid for this place, so we can
stay here.

WILL
That was the right thing to do --
pay them something for letting us
be here.

TOM
I rented this place. So we can
live here.

Will nods and keeps eating.

OMIT 148

INT. REMOTE RV, WILL’S ROOM - NIGHT 149

Hector is lying next to Will on the bed. Will pets his head.

EXT. REMOTE RV - DAY 150

Tom and Will are walking near their RV. Will tries a few
steps off his crutches, gingerly putting weight on his leg,
trying to walk normally. Tom hears music from a small party
in Dale's yard.

Blane sees them from a distance and waves.

Tom notices several neighbors carrying chairs over towards
Dale's.

TOM
c'mon?

WILL
Gonna walk around. Strengthen the
leg.

TOM

Dad, please. They’re good people.

She stares at him, imploring. Will feels a tug and he
obliges.

OMIT 151

EXT. DALE’S CABIN - DAY 152

The gathering is in process. Several people are playing
music. Dale is grilling.

Will manages to get his thanks out to Blane.

WILL
You look out for her. Thank you.

Blane puts his hand on Will’s shoulder, acknowledging Will's
gratitude.

Will observes -- he can see that Tom is comfortable, and that
Dale is warm towards her. He stands a little apart to avoid
the chance encounter. Tom steals a look to check on him.
While one of the neighbors is singing, Will quietly slips
away.

EXT. SUSAN’S DWELLING - DAY 153

Will moves quickly, despite the weakened leg. He doesn’t know
that Tom has followed him.

TOM
Dad, wait up.

He stops and waits for her.

TOM (CONT'D)
Can I show you something?

Tom beckons Will over to her hive.
154

90

TOM (CONT'D)
Have you ever seen inside of a
hive?

Tom approaches the hive with the smoker.

He shakes his head no.

The music from the gathering has changed, and a different
song wafts over the yard.

TOM (CONT'D)
Come closer.

She adds a few puffs of smoke before she opens the hive. Will
comes closer to get a look.

TOM (CONT'D)
Close your eyes.

Will does.
Tom lets the bees collect on her arm.

TOM (CONT'D)
Open.

She shows her dad the arm up close. Will takes in how
comfortable she is. The bees cover Tom’s arm like a long
glove. She is very alive, feeling everything.
TOM (CONT'D)

It’s OK, even if they get upset. A

person can withstand 500 stings.
She locks eyes with Will.
She smiles because it feels good.

WILL
Gonna walk around.

She moves to transfer the bees back to the hive.
TOM
OK.
EXT. DALE’S HOUSE - DAY 154

Tom has returned to the gathering. They’ve built a fire.
Someone in the group is singing.

EXT. REMOTE RV - NIGHT 155

Will is on the front stairs of the RV listening to the
distant music from the gathering, but he reacts to all sounds
nearby. He gets up to check around the RV, then sits back
down. Hector moves closer to Will and puts his head on
Will’s knee.

WILL
(to Hector)
She knows what she’s doing.

Tom approaches the RV humming a line from the song at the
shindig. She joins her dad. Tom puts her arms around him.
Together, they are 50% agony; 50% hope.

TOM
I know that you have some things in
your mind that I can’t understand.
The Pacific Tree frogs start up their chorus and they listen
together.
INT. REMOTE RV - MORNING 156
When Tom looks in Will’s room, she stops in her tracks. His
few items of clothing are on the bed, along with the map, and
some food.
TOM
What’re you doing? Your leg isn’t
even healed all the way.
He finishes rolling a blanket.
TOM (CONT'D)
It won’t heal right. I don’t want
to leave.
Will looks down, searching for words to explain.

TOM (CONT'D)
Last time you almost died-

He raises his eyes to look at her.
TOM (CONT'D)
And you would have if I hadn’t
found you.

He looks down, thinking.
157

WILL
It won’t happen to us again.

She wants him to understand; she tries again.

TOM
The people here aren’t very
different from us. Don’t you see
that?

WILL
Yes. They’ve been very good to us,
but we need to go back to our own
way of life.

TOM
Why can’t you stay?

Will shuts his eyes, wishing he had words for it. He packs
food. Tom is frustrated. She watches him pack the few last
things.
TOM (CONT’D)

The same thing that’s wrong with

you is not wrong with me.
She's scared that she just said that.
She hears the door of the RV click. She won’t turn around to
look.

her, looking back, waiting for her.

EXT. WOODS NEAR DALE’S —- DAY 158

Tom can see Will in the distance. He can’t move as quickly as
he once did. Tom soon overtakes him.

TOM
Are you just going to leave?

WILL
No, I want you to come with me.
Your home is with me. And mine is
with you.

Her tears well up.

WILL (CONT'D)
At least that’s the way it’s always
been.

She squeezes his hand.

EXT. WOODS NEAR DALE’S —- DAY 159

They've been hiking for a while on an evergreen lined logging
path. Will stops to rest.

They sit in silence. He looks up at a big tree above them,
lost in thought.

WILL
We'll find a good spot.

Will passes Tom some of the bread he packed. He’s brought her
jar of honey, with the label that she’s decorated. She takes
the jar, but doesn’t open it. Will reaches for the jar and
drizzles some honey on the bread.

She looks out into the expanse of woods. She knows why her
dad loves being in the forest.

A gust of wind rustles the branches. A wild hare forages,
unafraid. The trees sway. He stands up ready to continue the
search for their new place.

TOM
We're not going to find that again.

He starts to walk. Fighting heavy resistance, Tom follows her
father. She lags behind him. He looks back at her. Tom is
distant and upset. [wildlife image]. He slows down until she
catches up. The leaves rustle loudly. She looks at him.

TOM (CONT'D)
Dad -

In the silence it becomes clear what she’s about to say.

WILL
Can you find your way back?

TOM
Yes.

Will’s eyes well up.

TOM (CONT'D)
[You taught me.]

WILL
Tell that we’ll be in touch.
TOM
Will you check on me?
WILL
Yes.
TOM

I know you would stay if you could.
Will nods. Tom buries her tears in his shoulder and hugs him.

TOM (CONT'D)
I love you, Green.

WILL
I love you, Yellow.

He hugs her tightly.

TOM
You know where to find me.
95

Will finds it hard to let go.

Tom takes the mushroom guide out of her pack and hands it to
him. They stand in arm’s reach, neither able to make the
first move. Will nods that it’s OK. Tom begins walking
backwards, watching her dad walk away. She holds the seahorse
until her dad becomes small in the distance. When she can no
longer see him, she turns forward and heads back in the
direction of Dale’s.

EXT. WOODS NEAR DALE'S - DAY 161
Halfway back to Dale’s, Hector meets her on the path.

TOM
He had to go.

Hector looks in the direction of Will. Tom faces forward.
