TYPED WORDS APPEAR ON A GLOWING SCREEN 1

One letter at a time: “No one ever saw them again...”

EXT. CLEARING -- DAY 2
PANNING OVER GIRLS’ STUFF abandoned on dead grass.

GIRL’S VOICE #1 (0.S.)
They left things in the clearing
and walked into the trees. Holding
hands...

A TITLE CARD APPEARS: CUMBERLAND, RHODE ISLAND

We keep panning over the discarded items. A journal, a photo,
inexpensive jewelry, a bedazzled cellphone...

But each item is either ripped or smashed.

NEWS VIDEO - THAT CLEARING 3

POLICE search with dogs. ONE OF THE POLICEMEN holds up a
TEDDY BEAR. Torn in half...

BOY’S VOICE #1 (0.S.)
All the girls were like totally
normal. None of them was on drugs
or anything. One of them was like a
Girl Scout. Or Explorer Scout. Or
something like that...

A RAPID-FIRE SERIES OF CLASS PHOTOS
TEENAGED GIRLS' faces. Some freckled, most smiling.

NEWS FOOTAGE 5

POLICE and FIREMEN mill about a smoldering structure. A still-
standing sign says: CUMBERLAND HIGH SCHOOL LIBRARY.

ON VIDEO 6
A BOY WITH GLASSES talks to his Web Cam.

BOY WITH GLASSES
I just can’t see a natural fire
burning that hot. The walls were
melted. I bet the only place
anybody'd ever seen anything like
that was in Hiroshima.

EXT. SCHOOL LIBRARY -- DAY 7
The same burned structure. WORKERS sift through the ashes.

A FIREMAN, standing amid the charred ruins of the library,
holds up an intact SURVEILLANCE CAMERA.

Allison staggers slightly.

BOY'S VOICE #2 (0.S.)
The cop who found her said she was
holding something. Turned out it
was...

Viewed from the front, Allison is holding something. She
raises her eyes toward us. And opens her hands. As if
offering what's in them. Some bloody mess of something...

TYPED WORDS APPEAR ON A GLOWING SCREEN 10

One letter at a time: "Her own tongue.”

SURVEILLANCE VIDEO: INT. HOSPITAL -- DAY 11

Filmed through safety glass inset in a door. The girl,
Allison, has a haunted look on her face.

GIRL’S VOICE #5 (0.S.)
They gave her a piece of paper and
asked her to write down what
happened. But she only wrote one
word...

TYPED WORDS APPEAR ON A GLOWING SCREEN 12

One letter at a time: “Him.”

FROZEN IMAGE - FROM THAT LIBRARY SURVEILLANCE CAMERA FOOTAGES
Of the girls walking into the woods. PUSH IN to the
background on a dark aberration. Blurred and out of focus. An
incomprehensible human shape.

Hideously tall and thin. Featureless. Disproportionately long
arms extending downwards.

A terrifying, faceless figure...

TITLE ON BLACK: SLENDER MAN 14

EXT. SCHOOL - P.E. FIELD -- DAY 15
ON VIDEO: A cat dances while wearing shades and a bow-tie...

This is on a cell in the hand of HALLIE, 17, fit and
athletic. Hair pulled back in a pony tail. A lively spark in
Hallie’s eyes quickly evolves into a brilliant smile.

She leans over and replays the video for KATIE, 17, sitting
next to her in the bleachers. Unlike Hallie, she doesn’t look
the part in a “Massachusetts Charter” P.E. uniform.

Katie draws her hair back and stares at the screen. The day
old eyeliner around her eyes was left on intentionally. A
tiny act of defiance.
Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 4.

HALLIE
It'd be better if he didn't have
the bow-tie.

A quirky little grin flashes across Katie’s face.

KATIE
It'd be better if he exploded at
the end.

P.E. TEACHER
(calling from the field)
Katie, you're up!

Katie brazenly ignores him. Hallie gives her a look.

KATIE
Whatever. He'll give up after a
second. He doesn't really want me
having a heart attack on his field.

The P.E. Teacher indeed moves on. Hallie smiles.

HALLIE
I'm forwarding this to Wren...

16 INT. SCHOOL - CLASSROOM -- DAY 16

WREN, 17, talks to her very PATIENT TEACHER having his sack
lunch. Her carefully disheveled bob and retro-cool glasses
lend her a unique and clever sense of style.

High school posh with a Euro flair makes sure she sticks out.

WREN
I've been thinking about my short
story collection. I'm thinking
maybe it's a novel.

Wren looks at her phone. Sees the video link from Hallie.
Watches and texts back: Groovy.

WREN (CONT'D)
Of course, when I'm published my
mother will hire someone to kill
me. There are things in there she
doesn't know I know. Things her
theater friends in Berlin told me.
They were shocked and Berliners
don't shock easily... Do you know
the city?

Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 5.

PATIENT TEACHER
(tolerant)
I've never been.

EXT. SCHOOL - LOCKER AREA -- DAY 17
KIDS hover in the hallway. Wren, Hallie and Katie come along.

Out of her gym clothes, Katie's look is edgier than the
others. Buckled and worn leather boots and jeans. A screen-
printed heart with large black wings spread across her faded
and ragged out t-shirt.

They see CHLOE (17). Alert, pretty. She makes her way over,
adjusting her sweater.

KATIE
(sarcastic)
Nice sweater...

HALLIE
Katie!

Hallie tries to come to the rescue, but Chloe can stand up
for herself.

CHLOE
I got it at Tilly's. It’s in all
the magazines...

The girls keep walking. Chloe falls in with them.

WREN
It's YOUR life. We can only offer
guidance.

CHLOE

Eat me, bitch.

The girls laugh as they near a group of BOYS. Wren lowers
her voice, in a mock-British accent-

WREN
Just ahead, the Dude-Bro in his
natural habitat. Let's observe,
shall we?

Hallie laughs at Wren's little remark as they skirt the edge
of the boys. But when her chuckle's over, Hallie looks back
and sees TOM (17).
Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 6.

He’s tall, clean cut, and flanked by “bro”-type buddies. But
his broad, sleepy-eyed smile and gentle disposition sets him
apart from the rest.

Casually, he glances in Hallie’s direction.

She thinks he’s hailing her.

She opens her mouth to say "Hey" back. But embarrassingly,
it’s a false alarm. Hallie awkwardly covers her mistake by
rubbing her nose. Wren observes all and shakes her head.

To add to Hallie's embarrassment, Wren calls out...

WREN (CONT'D)
Hey Tom, what's the plan tonight?

Tom smiles.

TOM
BIG plans--

But one of the boys, A BURLY KID with a Red Sox cap
interrupts.

BURLY KID
Hey! Top secret!

Tom shrugs. Maybe even winks as the boys continue past. Wren
turns laughing to Hallie.

WREN
Circle jerk?
KYLE (17), slightly nerdy and definitely bookish, brings up
the rear. Not bad looking, but obviously the runt of the
litter.

KYLE
Hey, Chloe.

He nods, falling just short of making effective eye contact.

Chloe smiles back.

CHLOE
So, Kyle, what's the big secret?
KYLE
I could tell you but I'd have to
kill you.
CHLOE

Yeah?
19

Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 7.

Hallie rolls her eyes.
The “End of the Day” bell rings.

HALLIE
I, for one, am intrigued but I've
got to go get my sister.

Hallie smiles and peels off. Chloe engages Kyle in further
conversation. While Wren and Katie exchange amused looks.

INT. HALLIE'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM -- NIGHT 19

Family dinner time. Meet Hallie’s MOTHER and FATHER, 40s. And
sister, LIZZIE, a sweet 14-year-old mirror image of Hallie.

HALLIE'S FATHER
I bumped into Coach Sanders today.
He said your 1600 meter time is
really improving. All that training
is paying off. Good job, honey.

Hallie smiles. About to say thanks, but Lizzie interrupts--

LIZZIE
Did you tell them? Dolores
Constantino quit the team...

Hallie shoots Lizzie a look.

HALLIE’S MOTHER
Why?

LIZZIE
She's pregnant.

Hallie continues to glare at Lizzie: “Why bring that up?”
Their mother internally “Tsk tsks...”

HALLIE'S MOTHER
What does she imagine she'll do
now?

HALLIE
She wants to keep it. She's going
to drop out and have the baby.

HALLIE'S MOTHER
17-years-old? My God.

It could end there but Hallie doesn’t like her mother’s tone.
Decides to lob a grenade.
20

Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 8.

HALLIE
Doesn't she have the right to?

Hallie’s mother jumps on it.

HALLIE'S MOTHER
The question is, is it smart?

HALLIE
Smart isn't always what matters.
Sometimes you have to do what you
feel, even if it doesn't make
sense. That's what it is to be a
person, right? To have free will? A
person has the right to say two
plus two equals five.

HALLIE’S MOTHER
Okay, Dostoevsky.

Hallie sighs in an irritated and overdramatic fashion. Her
mother lets it slide, but only for a moment.

HALLIE’S MOTHER (CONT’D)
So, I suppose WREN is going to be
at Katie's tonight...

HALLIE
Yeah, so...

HALLIE’S MOTHER
So...I just noticed a change since
you two started hanging out-

Hallie glares at her. A stinger. Every teenager's super
power.

And as if on cue, the DOORBELL rings.

INT. HALLIE’S HOUSE - ENTRYWAY -- MOMENTS LATER 20

Lizzie opens the door to let Wren in. She's obviously excited
to see the older girl. Wren knows it and likes it.

WREN
How you doin' kid?

LIZZIE
(making sure her parents
don't hear)
I wore the t-shirt you gave me to
school. I got sent to the
principal's office.

Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 9.
WREN
Well done.
Hallie shakes her head as she grabs her coat. Playfully
tweaks Lizzie's braid before she and Wren head out. Lizzie is
left just standing there. Wishing she could go, too.
INT. KATIE'S HOUSE - ENTRYWAY -- NIGHT 21
Katie lets Hallie and Wren in.
KATIE
Don't make any noise. “IT’S”
dormant.
Reveal KATIE’S FATHER, 40s. Ex-military but still sports the
crew-cut. He’s asleep on a couch in the living room. In front

of an old movie. Vodka in evidence.

KATIE (CONT'D)

(resigned)
Just another Friday night at the
Jensen's...
INT. KATIE'S HOUSE - BASEMENT -- LATER 22

A lone bare bulb hangs from the ceiling. The warm pool of
light casts shadows of scattered and forgotten belongings in
the dark recesses under the house. Rotting wooden posts
struggle to support the floor above.

Somewhere in the darkness, A TINY SIX-LEGGED CREATURE
skitters across a spiderweb.

He watches silently from a corner where the rafters meet. The
four girls lounge in recycled sofas and rescued furniture in
the belly of the room below.

It’s a dark and dank little clubhouse, hidden away from the
outside world.

WREN
Seriously, I think you and Karl
will make an adorable couple.

CHLOE
It’s Kyle. And I don't even like
him...
Blue Rev. (06/09/16)

WREN
Sure, sure. Like you don't wish you
were there with him at their secret
sausage fest right now.

CHLOE
No, but...
(beat)
I do know what their big secret is.

WREN
Do tell.

CHLOE
They're all getting together at
Tom's house. In his garage to try
to summon Slender Man.

A heavy silence fills the room.
WREN
(mockingly)
Creepy.

Hallie studies the others, not quite grasping the

HALLIE
What’s Slender Man?
KATIE
(to Hallie)

The guy who makes kids disappear?
Hallie doesn’t have a clue.

HALLIE
Wait. Why have I not heard of this?

WREN
That’s a longer conversation...

situation.

Hallie gives Wren the finger. Scopes her phone. Enters

"Slender Man" in her search browser.
FOOTSTEPS POUND THE FLOOR ABOVE THEM.

It’s so loud they all flinch!!

The girls sit frozen in place. Listening. Eyes following the

movement above.

The light hanging over their heads sends dark shadows over

their eyes. Like they’re telling ghost stories by

campfire.
Blue Rev. (06/09/16) ll.

WREN (CONT'D)
(whispers)
What the hell is he doing?
KATIE
Probably looking for another
bottle.
(child-like)
"Daddy needs his medicine..."
Hallie smiles at the joke and pops in her ear buds.
We watch her click on a video link.

- IN THE VIDEO: A long, slow PUSH-IN on a black and white
image of a burned down library. Text scrolls up from below...

- “IN THE SUMMER OF 2001, SEVEN GIRLS FROM THE TOWN OF
CUMBERLAND, RHODE ISLAND WENT MISSING WITHOUT A TRACE.”

Hallie can still hear the girls talking back and forth.
KATIE (CONT'D)
I hate living here. All he does is
drink, sleep, and shit.
The girls laugh.

Everyone but Hallie, focused on her phone.

- The video continues to zoom in on the smoldering library as
the text clears. Closer and closer.

KATIE (CONT'D)
It’s just so much worse since my
mom left--

THE FLOOR CREAKS ABOVE.

Katie, Chloe, and Wren look up. Following with their eyes.

Hallie listens with them, still watching the image on her
phone as it evolves into a dark indistinguishable shape.

- Then four words surface in the center of the frame.
-— “ONLY ONE CAME BACK...”

Katie’s eyes drop to the floor as her father’s footsteps fade
away and disappear.

KATIE (CONT'D)
Sometimes I just wanna leave. You
know?
Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 12.

She glances up, looking for comfort in her friends’ eyes.
WREN
I have friends in Paris. We could
stay with them.
HALLIE
(not looking up from her
phone)
What friends? You’ve never even
been to Paris...

WREN
My mom has friends there, idiot.

WE HEAR MORE FOOTSTEPS CARRY THROUGH THE HOUSE.
Katie looks to the ceiling.
KATIE
Don’t I wish. I’m totally stuck in
this shithole...

Then something draws Hallie’s attention back to her phone.

- Out of nowhere, a LOW EERIE DRONE. It grows in Hallie’s
ears until it drowns out the chatter in the room.

Hallie looks over as the girls continue to discuss something
she can no longer hear.

- ON THE SCREEN: Something seems to be taking form in the
indistinct, shadowy regions of the grainy image.

Hallie struggles to focus, pulling the screen closer.
In this moment, it’s like the real world around her has
decelerated. Almost paused, as the INTENSE LOW TONE HEIGHTENS

in Hallie’s ears.

She stares at the mysterious, silent shape on screen.
Unblinking. Straining to make sense of it. Until...

- A HIDEOUS SHRIEKING FACE LEAPS OFF THE SCREEN! !
HALLIE SCREAMS!
Wren, Katie, and Chloe jump.

WREN
What the hell?!
Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 13.

HALLIE
(laughing now)
Oh my God. Look!

WREN
What?

The girls gather around now. Watching the same video of the
burned library.

Chloe reads from the screen, a haunting tone to her voice.
Getting into the moment.
CHLOE
"In the summer of 2001, seven girls
from the town of Cumberland, Rhode
Island went missing without a
trace..."

KATIE
We can read.

CHLOE
Good for you.

We watch in silence as the girls stare at the screen.
The low drone intensifies. Warbling and over-modulating.

WREN
This made you scream?

HALLIE
Wait. It’s coming up.

The sound slowly dies out. Silence sets in around them as
they huddle together in the center of the room. The tiny lamp
above keeps the darkness at bay as they focus on the phone.
HALLIE (CONT'D)
(whispers)
It was right after-
THE SHRIEKING FACE! !
They all jump as it leaps out at them. Then start laughing!

Katie snatches the phone. She backs up the video and freezes
the frame.

With the shrieking face frozen on screen, it becomes clear
that it has been crudely digitally added to the still image.

It's a girl. Eyes wide. Hair and face drenched in blood.
Tan Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 14.

CHLOE
That's- you know who that is? From
"Carrie"...
KATIE
That is the girl from "Carrie."
WREN
That is patently the girl from

"Carrie."

Hallie averts her eyes, embarrassed. Wren’s judgmental
comment clearly directed at her.

Katie scrolls through more links. Clicks on another...

ON THE SCREEN: Disturbing images of a tall, shadowed figure
Slide through frame. Always alone. Watching. Waiting. Staring
without eyes. Just a pale white, blank face...

...Like it’s been erased.

- A human-like depiction of a figure wearing a black suit and
blood red tie. Sickly pale skin covers a featureless face.

- The hideously thin form lurks in a dark forest, its
impossibly long arms reaching towards us.

- Black tentacles spread from the back of another tall
figure. They twist around his body on all sides. Face blank
like the others. Its elongated arms hanging at its sides.

Katie grabs her laptop now. Chloe continues reading from her
phone. Wren looks at her cell, too.

CHLOE
"He preys upon innocent youth..."

KATIE
Sounds like my Uncle Herbert.

The girls snicker as Chloe continues.
CHLOE
“Slender Man is said to live ina
hidden mansion, but the location is
unknown...”

WREN
Really? Is he single?

Chloe cracks this time. She can’t help but laugh.

Tan Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 15.

KATIE
Here it is!
(looks up)
“How To Summon Slender Man."

A devious smile creeps across Wren’s face.

WREN
We have to do this.

CHLOE
We actually don’t. Actually...
MOMENTS LATER 23
A video is cued up on Katie’s laptop. A sparse web page with
a generic black background. A foreboding play symbol waits
patiently. One line of basic text reads...

“How To Summon Slender Man”

The girls gather around as if prepping the stage for some
bizarre, ancient ritual.

Hallie hits the lights.
KATIE
Seriously, this feels like clicking
on something really Russian and
malware-y.

WREN
Don’t be such a pussy.

Katie shoots her a look.

Wren reaches in and clicks play on the laptop.

THE VIDEO EXPANDS AUTOMATICALLY, FILLING THE ENTIRE SCREEN.
- IT STARTS TO PLAY: Footage of A FOREST over a dead silence.
Almost a still image, but the mist slowly drifting between

gives it away.

A sinister glow from the screen up-lights the girls’ faces as
they gaze into the display. Hypnotized.

- Shots of ISOLATED LONELY TREES. Towering pillars that rise
into a darkened canopy. Twisted branches cutting through the
night sky.
Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 16.

CHLOE
Listen to this shit...

(reading from her phone)
“Those who hear the three bells
toll, accept HIS invitation...When
you hear the first you must close
your eyes, keeping words
unspoken...

- On screen, eerie image after image repeat over and over.
Crooked trees separated by a dark void inside the forest.

CHLOE (CONT'D)
If one wants to hear they must
listen closely, for they are faint
and distant. With eyes still closed
and the mind wide open...clear your
thoughts as you await the second...

- An ever present fog, hides something from view. Something
we can almost see. But the image keeps changing. Switching to
another.
CHLOE (CONT'D)
+.-Only opening your eyes once you
hear the third...”
Chloe shakes her head, trying to make sense of it.

The girls are spellbound, soaking in the pale glow from the
screen. Except for Chloe who nervously laughs and backs away.

CHLOE (CONT'D)
Whatever...this is dumb-

Wren pulls Chloe reluctantly back into the mix.

WREN
Chloe! Shut up...

The girls return to the image on the screen, silence ringing
in their ears. An anxious tension as they hold their
collective breath.

Listening... Waiting...

WREN (0.S.) (CONT'D)
BOO! !

THEY ALL JUMP AND SCREAM.

KATIE
Very funny bitch. Knock it off.
Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 17.

Now nervous laughter. Wren quickly shushes them.
ON THE LAPTOP: We begin to hear the sound of trees creaking
in the breeze. Wind rustling through branches. A moment
later, very faintly...soft and far way...
A BELL ECHOES IN THE FOREST.
The girls look at each other.
WREN
(devious)

Let’s do it.

They all close their eyes, giggling. But Chloe pauses, gun-
shy. Wren nudges her and she follows along.

Then a silent moment.

We hear the girls breathe, waiting in the electric glow from
the screen.

ON THE LAPTOP: A SECOND FAINT BELL RESONATES, carrying out
from somewhere deep in the darkened woods on screen.

With her eyes still closed, Chloe lets out an awkward laugh.

CHLOE
Are you serious? This is so--

THE OTHER THREE
(eyes closed)
SHHH!!
Chloe sighs in resignation and keeps her eyes shut.
ON THE LAPTOP: The sound of the forest settles. A hushed
stillness. We can hear the sounds of leaves landing softly on
the ground. LIKE TINY FOOTSTEPS IN THE DARKNESS...

Then, barely audible, a low faraway tone. An unsettling
hollow ring...

- THE FINAL BELL TOLLS.

WREN

Do you guys hear that?
KATIE

Yes.
HALLIE

I think so.
24

Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 18.
CHLOE
Maybe. I don’t know...
They open their eyes as the sound slowly dies and fades away.
- ON THE SCREEN NOW: A static silhouette of a large, gnarled
and twisted oak tree. Branches reach out into the frame like
tentacles winding their way out of its thick black trunk.
The girls sit, eyes fixed, waiting for something to happen.

But nothing comes.

- Just that ominous image of the towering oak tree staring
back at them. Relentless...Unwavering...

- Or is it? Is the tree moving?

THE SCREEN SUDDENLY STROBES WITH IMAGES WE CAN’T MAKE OUT.
The girls shudder, shielding themselves.

- Then the image cuts out. Just disappears.

THE SCREEN GOES TOTALLY BLACK.

A deafening silence as the girls sit frozen in the dark room.
Nobody speaks. Temporarily blind. The screen now blank.

Chloe and Hallie look at each other, completely unnerved.
Trying to shake off the mutually disturbing feeling.

WREN
What a stupid video...

But Wren’s eyes give it away. She’s just as rattled and
quickly clicks the lights on. The lone bulb above them washes
away the darkness. The girls breathe easier now as they
recover from the intense on-screen assault.

Except for Katie. Who just sits there. Staring at the blank
screen...
LATER - 3 AM 24

Moonlight from a small basement window sketches outlines of
random junk in the room.

We see the same tiny spider, spinning his web. Pausing
occasionally to watch the girls who lay blanketed on couch
cushions and cots in the darkness below.
Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 19.

Hallie struggles to fall asleep. Wrestles with her makeshift
bed. Looks over at Wren and sees her eyes are open, too. Same
unsettled look on her face.

Across the room, Katie looks at her phone. And Chloe just
lies there on her cot. Both also far from sleep.

Hallie says nothing. Just lies back down and closes her eyes.
But we see...

POV - The laptop rests on the coffee table. The tiny green
light blinking. Endlessly. Draining the power.

SUDDENLY, A FLURRY OF IMAGES ON THE SCREEN!!

We can see now they are split second flashes of Slender Man
that quickly vanish into nothing.

Back to an ordinary laptop. No blinking green light. No more
power to be drained.

Just a dead black screen...

INT. SCHOOL BUS -- DAY

Katie looks slightly distracted as she sits with Hallie,
Wren, and Chloe. But the girls don’t really see it.

Hallie finds her gaze continually drawn a few rows over. To
where Tom sits. She quickly averts her eyes when he looks in
her direction.

CHLOE
Don't make any pregnancy jokes but
I felt so nauseous this morning. I
threw up twice.
Hallie turns at this, faintly troubled.

HALLIE
Have you been having nightmares?

Chloe thinks about it. Shakes her head. But Hallie notices
Wren react to the question.

HALLIE (CONT'D)
Have you?

Wren looks like she's been caught at something.

HALLIE (CONT'D)
What was it?
Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 20.

WREN
Nothing really, just that video...

HALLIE
From the sleep over?

Wren nods.

HALLIE (CONT'D)
But that was like a week ago.

WREN
Not really surprising.

Hallie contemplates. Meanwhile, Katie continues to stare
blankly out her window. Into the treeline.

EXT. OLD CEMETERY -- DAY

WREN (0.S.)
Why a cemetery? It’s hardly worth a
field trip. I mean, it’s a goddamn
cemetery?

Large granite monuments, crumbling headstones form a crude
skyline behind the gates of an old cemetery.

Inside, a GROUP OF STUDENTS follow a TOUR GUIDE. Wren and our
girls amongst them.

TOUR GUIDE
This burial ground dates back to
the Revolutionary War...

Katie and Hallie follow, lagging behind. Katie ignores the
tour and stares off into the distance.

POV - A TREELINE skirts the edge of the old cemetery. The
trees tower above it. A dense, untamed forest. No way to see
where one tree begins and another ends.

TOUR GUIDE (CONT’D)
Generations of soldiers have been
laid to rest here since...

Now the tour passes A LARGE MAUSOLEUM. Elaborate carvings are
etched in the cracked and deteriorating stone walls.

As the guide continues on, Katie steps away from the group.
She drifts across, studying the massive grave.
Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 21.

A LIFE-SIZED BRONZE STATUE OF AN ANGEL guards the entrance to
the mausoleum. Decades of corrosion have turned the angel's
skin a ghastly shade of green.

Katie steps over and faces the lifeless statue.

Years of weathering and erosion give the horrific appearance
of BLACK TEARS FLOWING FROM THE ANGEL’S EYES. Mold grows in
the dark stains that stream down her face.

The tour guide’s voice fades into the background as Katie
absorbs the angel’s empty gaze.

We see a deep sadness in Katie’s eyes. Emotion hiding just
under the surface. It overwhelms her. Tears begin to form.

And just as her first tear is about to fall...

IT TURNS BLACK AND RUNS DOWN HER CHEEK.

Then another one...

Two dark tears drip from her eyes. Katie wipes them away...
BUT THE TEARS KEEP FLOWING. STREAMING DOWN HER FACE.

Katie panics when she looks at her hands. Inky black liquid
drips off her face and pools in the palms of her hands.

Her panic turns to pain and she starts to choke. The black
tears streak down her face, draining the color from her skin.

She looks back up, fighting for air...

AND THE ANGEL SCREAMS!! BUT ITS FACE IS NOW BLURRED AND
FEATURELESS. A BLANK VOID!!

KATIE GASPS FOR AIR. SHE CAN’T LOOK AWAY!

WE SEE THE TERROR IN KATIE’S EYES AS THE STATUE RISES UP IN
FRONT OF HER. GROWING TALLER!! MORPHING INTO A TOWERING
SLENDER FIGURE. ARMS REACHING DOWNWARD!!

KATIE STANDS PARALYZED. SHE CAN’T MOVE. IT HAS CONTROL OVER
HER BODY!!

SHE CAN’T BREATHE!! SHE CAN’T SCREAM!!!

HALLIE (0.S.)
Katie!

KATIE’S BODY JOLTS AS SHE SNAPS OUT OF THE VISION.

 

We see Hallie’s face. She stands right in front of Katie.
Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 22.

Everything is back to normal. The angel stands silently
outside the mausoleum.

HALLIE (CONT'D)
Katie...

Katie looks around, confusion all over her face.
TOUR GUIDE
(to Katie)
You okay, young lady? Looks like
you've seen a ghost...
Katie shakes her head.

TOUR GUIDE (CONT’D)
Well, you wouldn’t be the first...

As the group continues on, Katie’s eyes are drawn again to
the distant treeline.

29 INT. SCHOOL BUS -- DAY 29

A bus-load of kids sit waiting. Everyone there, except Katie.
Hallie looks out, scanning the perimeter for her friend.

At the gates of the cemetery. A TEACHER talks to the BUS
DRIVER. Just out of earshot. We see the urgency in the
teacher’s words. The anxiety in her eyes. The bus driver
looks past her, searching...

CHLOE
It’s Katie we're waiting for?

WREN
Yeah. I think.

HALLIE
Did she seem weird to you today?

WREN
Weird?

Wren looks at Hallie.

WREN (CONT'D)
Weird how?

Hallie shrugs, shaking her head.
HALLIE

I don’t know. Distant. She hardly
said anything all day.
Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 23.

CHLOE
Where is she?

HALLIE
Well, her bag’s here. She wouldn’t
just leave without it.

She motions to the backpack slung on the seat next to her.

30 EXT. OLD CEMETERY -- LATER 30

The students, now pulled off the bus, stand by as MORE
TEACHERS and SCHOOL OFFICIALS confer with CEMETERY OFFICIALS.

The girls watch as the commotion swirls around them. Hallie
finds that, by chance, Tom is standing right next to her.

He looks in her direction. They catch eyes.
Hallie takes it as an invitation.

HALLIE
If we have to stand around here any
longer, I think I’m gonna die.

Tom gives a slight chuckle.

HALLIE (CONT'D)
No pun intended...

TOM
(amused)
None taken.

Tom’s smile slowly fades as they share an awkward pause.
Nearby, Wren's on her phone, as Chloe anxiously looks on.

WREN (INTO PHONE)
Katie, cut this shit out. We're all
prisoners ‘cause of you....

TOM
(to Hallie)
None of you saw where she went?

Hallie just shakes her head. Wren hangs up and steps over.

WREN
It cut me off! Her mailbox is full.

HALLIE
She hasn't answered any of my
texts, either.
31

Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 24.
Hallie, Wren, and Tom look up to see Chloe’s eyes widening.
They spin around, and as if to confirm their darkest fears...
A TRIO OF POLICE CARS SWOOP INTO THE PARKING LOT.

WREN
Oh, shit!!

CHLOE
This is getting serious, people...
EXT. OLD CEMETERY -- DUSK 31

The tired sun dips behind the treeline. Slender shadows rake
across the graveyard, welcoming nightfall.

POLICE talk to school officials, finally releasing kids to
their waiting PARENTS.

There are FLASHLIGHTS in the woods. A SEARCH PARTY.
Chloe watches them moving behind the trees.
The lights vanish and reappear as they hunt for any sign of
her missing friend. Under everything, like a whisper in the
wind, we can hear the sound of the workers calling her name.
“Kaaaaatieee...”
Wren judges the look on Chloe’s face.
WREN

She just ditched. Trust me. She’1l

still be there annoying us

tomorrow.

Chloe nods. The sentiment helps, but she’s not convinced.

Hallie rummages through Katie's bag nearby. She stops and
peeks inside. Reaches in and pulls out...

AN OLD LIBRARY BOOK. The cover partially torn. Pages coming
unbound.

The title instantly strikes her: BARDO THODOL.

The worn pages almost break and split, crackling as Hallie
flips through. Wren leans in to get a better look.

A SERIES OF HAUNTING ILLUSTRATIONS FLASH BY...
- Dark spirits and tortured souls.

- Winged demons with razor sharp teeth.
32

Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 25.

- Phantoms amid a desolate landscape burning in the sun.
- A man screams, flesh being ripped from his body.

HALLIE
What class was this for?

Wren and Chloe have no response. In the shadow of the
graveyard behind them, the question takes on more weight.

Wren just gestures towards the parking lot.

WREN
Hallie...

Hallie's parents pull up, her mother waving from the window.

WREN (CONT'D)
I'll keep this shit for her.

HALLIE
(to Chloe and Wren)
Do you need a ride?

CHLOE
My mom’s on her way.

HALLIE
Okay. Call you later...

Hallie hands over the book and heads to the car. As she
leaves, she glances back over her shoulder.

Still no sign of Katie...

INT. HALLIE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT 32
News about Katie's disappearance plays on the TV. Hallie sits
watching with her family in the living room. As she live-
texts with Wren and Chloe-

Wren: This is unreal.

Hallie: I know.

Chloe: My mom asked if she was doing porn.

Hallie: And I thought my parents were dumb.

Hallie’s father turns up the TV volume now. She looks up...
Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 26.

REPORTER (ON TV)
Despite new footage, we're still
left with more questions than
answers.

ON TV: Shaky phone footage of the students at the cemetery.
Kids have their lunch on the grass. Katie is visible in the
background of the shot, unnoticed by the foreground kids. She
stands very still, frozen, staring off into the woods.

REPORTER (ON TV) (CONT'D)
No word at this time about any
possible mental health issues she
might have had or...

LIZZIE
(interrupting)
Was she on drugs?
Hallie shoots her sister a look.
HALLIE
(quietly)
You're not helping.

HALLIE'S MOTHER
Was she?

HALLIE
No. Don’t be ridiculous.

Hallie’s family thinks she has answers to the mystery. But
she doesn’t...

EXT. SCHOOL -- DAY

OMINOUS POV - As if something is watching the school from the
woods.

INT. CLASSROOM -- DAY

STUDENTS listen as a TEACHER drones on in the background.
Hallie stares out the window. Searching. Trying to comprehend
the grim fact that Katie is still missing. Then Hallie’s
expression darkens. Something unsettling...

HALLIE’S POV - Two police cars pull up in front of the

school. THE OFFICERS hop out. There’s a short exchange and
they head into the building.
Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 27.

A murmur rolls through the classroom as other students take
notice.

TEACHER (0.S.)
Hallie.

Hallie snaps out of it and looks up.

TEACHER (CONT'D)
They need you in the principal’s
office...

As Hallie gathers her things, the whispers evolve into a buzz
of conversation. Theories about Katie’s disappearance fill
the air and follow her out of the room.

OFFICER #1 (0.S.)
When did you last see her?
INT. SCHOOL CONFERENCE ROOM -- DAY
The blank, white walls give it the feel of an interrogation
room. Hallie sits opposite a stern-faced PRINCIPAL and TWO
POLICE OFFICERS. Confused and nervous, she chooses her words
carefully.

HALLIE
At the cemetery...

OFFICER #1
And before that?

INTERCUT HALLIE/CHLOE/WREN SPEAKING WITH THE INVESTIGATORS:

 

CHLOE
It was Saturday. We spent the night
at Katie’s house...

OFFICER #2
We?

WREN
Me, Chloe and Hallie...

HALLIE
We slept in the basement.

WREN
Mr. Jensen was upstairs. Passed out
on the couch. Again...

OFFICER #2
Where was her mother?
Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 28.

CHLOE
She moved out a while back.
OFFICER #1
Did Katie have a boyfriend?
WREN
Have you seen the boys at this
school?
OFFICER #1

Maybe there was someone she didn’t
tell you about?

CHLOE
No. She’s my best friend. Since
Kindergarten...

OFFICER #2

Would you say she was a happy girl?

HALLIE
She used to be...

WREN
But then her mom ran off with that
yoga instructor.

OFFICER #1
Did she ever talk about running
away?

HALLIE
Yeah...

CHLOE

But we all did...

WREN
I mean seriously, who hasn't
memorized the bus schedule outta
this shithole...

Tears form in Hallie’s eyes as her voice falters.

HALLIE

She wouldn’t just leave...
OFFICER #2

It happens more often than you’d

imagine.

The officers wrap things up.
34

Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 29.

OFFICER #1
Is there anything else?

Chloe hesitates...

OFFICER #2
Anything you haven’t told us?
WREN
No.
EXT. SCHOOL - LOCKER AREA -- DAY 34

A locker slams open. Hallie quickly swaps books and folders.
Then she pauses, looking into the locker.

A collage of pictures and clippings held in place by magnets
and tape. Stickered symbols and logos of her favorite bands.
And crowded in the center --

A PHOTO OF HALLIE AND KATIE TAKEN YEARS AGO.

A silly middle-school moment. Sparkling smiles. A flash of
innocence. Before they started taking themselves seriously.

Before Katie went missing...
A deep sadness fills Hallie’s eyes as she shuts her locker.

CHLOE (0.S.)
Hey!

She turns around to see Wren and Chloe hustling over.

WREN
What’d they ask you?

HALLIE
They wanted to know about Mr.
Jensen. And his drinking...

CHLOE
They asked me if I saw anything
weird. On the field trip...

HALLIE
What’d you tell’em?

CHLOE
No. But--—

Chloe stops and looks around to see if anyone’s listening.
Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 30.

CHLOE (CONT'D)
I was looking on my phone. The
stuff I took at the cemetery...

She holds it out and taps the screen.

Hallie squints to see.

CHLOE (CONT'D)
It's almost at the end...

- SHAKY FOOTAGE: Kyle sheepishly turns away as Chloe giggles
from behind the camera.

CHLOE (0.S.) (CONT’D)
C’mon...do it...

- The camera circles around, chasing. But Kyle tucks his head
down, keeping his back to us.

CHLOE (0.S.) (CONT’D)
Just one more time, for me...

- She corners him and Kyle gives in.

KYLE
Okay, okay!

- He faces the camera and flashes a completely nauseating,
but adorable puppy dog, sad face. Then he ducks out of frame.

- The camera lingers for a split second, trailing over the
trees in the background...

Horror spreads across Wren’s face.

WREN
Barf...I think I’m gonna throw up.

CHLOE
Shut up, not that.

Chloe hits pause.

CHLOE (CONT'D)
Look!

WREN
What am I supposed to be seeing?

Chloe takes a SCREENSHOT. Double-taps to ZOOM IN...

We fix on a blur of unfocused confusion. Chloe adjusts the
image until something slowly comes into view...
Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 31.

A_SHADOWED FIGURE.

HALLIE
It could be anything.

WREN
It’s a man, Moron.

The words send a chill down their spines. The three girls
just stare at the phone.

THE HAUNTING IMAGE STARES BACK.
Hallie’s nervous laugh breaks the spell.

HALLIE
Come on...It IS a public place...

WREN
Hallie! It's a goddamn man,
standing next to a goddamn cemetery
in the woods, watching goddamn
teenagers. That’s pretty GODDAMN
creepy right there, don’t you
think?

Terrible possibilities flood the girls' minds. Hallie hands
the phone back to Chloe.

HALLIE
Did you show it to the police? It
might be evidence. Probably not.
But you should give it to them.

Just to be... You know...
CHLOE
(interrupting)
Yeah. I know, but...It’s probably
nothing.

Hallie nods. She and Wren start to move on but only get a few
steps before Chloe calls after them-

CHLOE (CONT'D)

I wasn’t thinking it was Slender
Man. I mean, if that’s what you
thought I was thinking.

Hallie turns back.

HALLIE
No, I know.
35

Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 32.

But Hallie looks uneasy. Wren does, too. Though in a
different way. A hint of excitement dances in her eyes.
EXT. HALLIE’S HOUSE -- LATER THAT NIGHT 35

OMINOUS POV - A two-story home sits in darkness. The porch
light casts long thin shadows into the yard.

As the POV inches closer, a figure inside the house appears
in the front window. The POV watches the figure hold for a
moment and move past the window. Then the OMINOUS POV
continues onto the porch and up to the front door.

INT. HALLIE’S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

Muffled voices echo off the walls as the MOVING POV moves
silently down an empty hallway. A shaft of light spills

through an open door to another room.

The voices grow louder as the OMINOUS POV slips through the
light and into shadow. The words gradually become clear...

LIZZIE (0.S.)
I could stay home alone you know.
I'm old enough.

HALLIE (0.S.)
Physical age, maybe.

The mysterious POV turns a corner, plunging into darkness and
past an even darker utility room.

Moving ever so slowly, it drifts closer and closer to a
brightly lit...

DEN -- CONTINUOUS

Lizzie sits on the floor, homework scattered in front of her.
Hallie is huddled up on the couch looking at her phone.

- ON THE SCREEN: The shaky video of Kyle from Chloe’s camera.

CHLOE (0.S.)
C’mon...do it...

- The camera spins around Kyle.
Hallie taps the screen and fast-forwards.
- In fast motion, the camera circles around.

Hallie taps play.
Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 33.
CHLOE (0.S.) (CONT’D)
Just one more time, for me...
Lizzie peeks over, trying to see.
LIZZIE
You should tell me what really
happened to Katie. We never keep

secrets from each other.

PAUSE. Hallie hides the screen.

HALLIE
How would you know? Do your
homework.

LIZZIE

It was a boy, right? You think I'll
tell. I’d never tell.

HALLIE
(a little smile)
You'd totally tell.

LIZZIE
Not mom and dad.

HALLIE
Totally mom and dad.

LIZZIE
Maybe.

HALLIE
Definitely. But you get points for
honesty.

LIZZIE
So tell me!

Hallie just gives an empty look.

LIZZIE (CONT'D)
You don't know...do you?

Lizzie watches her search for an answer, but there isn’t one.

HALLIE
Lizzie, just finish your homework.

With a sigh, Lizzie turns to the papers scattered around her.
Hallie shifts back to the phone. The video. She taps play.

- ON THE SCREEN: Chloe laughs as the camera follows Kyle.
Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 34.
KYLE
Okay, okay!
- He makes his goofy sad face and ducks out of frame.
PAUSE. Hallie taps the screen.

- Slowly...frame by frame by frame...we inch through the
video. Then stop...ON THAT FRAME.

- The one we’ve seen before on Chloe’s phone. The one of the
man watching them from the woods.

Hallie studies the frozen image closely.

HALLIE’S POV - A LONG SHADOWED FIGURE.

- The compressed pixels don’t provide enough detail. Just a
vague outline sketched in a chaotic array of digital bits.
The bits add up to something that resembles a strange, tall,
thin human-like form.

CRACK. A sound from somewhere inside the house.

Both girls turn towards the sound, listening. It’s almost as
if it didn’t happen. But it did.

HALLIE
Did you hear that?

Lizzie just nods, a troubled look in her eyes.

We listen with our ears wide open. It’s so quiet we can hear
everything. The girls breathing. A clock on the wall ticking.

Hallie stares out of the open door, into the hallway.

But there’s nothing. Only shadow. No sound. No movement. Only
silence, until...

ANOTHER NOISE. This time quieter. Softer.

LIZZIE
What is that-

HALLIE
Shh!

Hallie steps over to the open doorway and pauses. Listening.

HALLIE (CONT'D)
Mom?
Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 35.
Her voice shatters the silence. They wait, listening. But
there’s no response.

HALLIE (CONT'D)
Dad?

The words echo out into the hallway and disappear.
THEN SOMETHING DRAGS!! Like furniture being moved...
The girls freeze.

LIZZIE
Someone’s here...

Hallie motions for her to be quiet and moves into the
hallway. Towards the dark void inside the utility room.

Listens a moment. Still nothing.

Her eyes darting from place to place in the hallway.
Searching every corner. Checking every shadow.

HALLIE’S CELLPHONE CHIMES.

The sound sends a jolt through her body. She checks the
screen...

- It's that screenshot from Chloe’s phone. The man in the
trees watching them. But clearer now.

- The accompanying text, from Wren: “Auto-corrected for
brightness on Chloe's computer!”

She focuses her eyes back toward the utility room. A black
hole of darkness inside. She holds still as her eyes adjust.

HALLIE’S POV OF THE UTILITY ROOM - Just a washing machine.
Cleaning products. An ironing board.

Hallie continues past, slowly peeking around the corner.
HALLIE’S POV - The corridor leads away from us, into the
front of house. Still empty. Only the one slash of light
cutting across hallway.

NOW A FLOOR BOARD CREAKS IN THE LIVING ROOM!

Hallie can’t see it, but something is moving in the front of
the house.

CREAK! !
37

Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 36.
It continues as something heavy moves through the open spaces
in the house. Rocking back and forth...Changing pitch.
Louder. Softer.
Hallie stares down the hallway as a shadow comes into view.

HALLIE’S POV - A long, thin, distorted human-like shape
stretches across the floor.

SLIDING INTO THE HALLWAY! SOMETHING IS ABOUT TO APPEAR!!
Hallie scrambles back into the den, glancing back.
A LIGHT FLICKERS ON IN THE HALLWAY.

A light that wasn't there just a moment ago! Beaming down
into the utility room.

Hallie slides into the den. Lizzie holds tight to her sister,
staring out. Trapped in the room.

Then slowly, like spilled ink...

THE LONG, THIN SHADOW FLOATS INTO VIEW. SLITHERING ACROSS THE
FLOOR. IT BENDS INTO AN IMPOSSIBLE SHAPE AS IT ROLLS UP THE
WALL. AT ANY MOMENT IT WILL ROUND THE CORNER! !

INT. HALLIE’S HOUSE - DEN -- CONTINUOUS 37

Lizzie starts to say something, but Hallie wraps her hand
over her mouth and shuts the door as quietly as possible.

THEY HEAR THE FLOOR CREAK OUTSIDE THE DOOR!!
The sound grows louder and louder. Closer and closer...
Accompanied by a LOW MURMUR!
Lizzie is consumed with fear, starts to cry...
HALLIE
(whispers)
Shh!
THEY HEAR THAT LOW MURMUR AGAIN.

The sisters stand there, holding their breath. Listening...
Waiting...

SUDDENLY, THE DEN DOOR KNOB JIGGLES!

Something on the other side! Trying to get in!
Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 37.

Lizzie clutches Hallie’s arm, hiding behind her.
HALLIE (CONT'D)
(threatens )
We called the police!
She only now begins to dial 9...1...
But the jiggling stops. And then nothing.

Just a dead, heavy silence.

Hallie lets out a trembling breath. Eyes fixed on the door.
Lizzie hides behind her, fear building as each moment passes.

THEN POUNDING on the other side of the door...
THE GIRLS JUMP AND SCREAM!

But the pounding only lasts a second. Followed by a LOW,
MUFFLED SOUND...

Like a hopeless sob.

Hallie's expression changes. She keeps Lizzie behind her and
steps over to the door. She slowly opens it. Just a crack.

Then freezes. She sees something...

HALLIE’S POV - A TALL, MASSIVE FIGURE silhouetted by the
light in the hallway! Its back to her...

DEEP VOICE (0.S.)
Is she here?

Hallie starts to back away when-
The figure turns around.
IT’S KATIE’S FATHER!

His clothes unwashed and stained. Haggard and unshaven. A
madness behind his bloodshot eyes.

HALLIE
Mr. Jensen?

KATIE’S FATHER
Is she?

HALLIE
Jesus. You scared me. What are you
doing-
Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 38.
KATIE’S FATHER
Answer me, Goddamnit! Is she?
Hallie's about to answer. But Katie's Father turns venomous-
KATIE'S FATHER
Is my daughter here? Are you hiding
her here!?

He moves towards her.

KATIE’S FATHER
Tell me!

Hallie backs up. Scared-

HALLIE
I don’t know!

KATIE'S FATHER
It's 'cause of you! She was never
into any of that stuff before. All
that occult stuff!
Lizzie sticks her head out from behind Hallie.

HALLIE
Lizzie! Stay back!

But Katie's Father charges in. His watery-red eyes glaring...
KATIE'S FATHER
Where is she?! Where's my
daughter?!

He reaches for Hallie, his giant hands clamping down on her
arms.

HALLIE
Let go!!!

Hallie tries to wrestle free.

KATIE'S FATHER
Give me back my daughter!

They stumble into the middle of the room. Katie’s father
loses his balance. Staggers into the coffee table.

Hallie breaks loose. Scrambles to Lizzie. They bolt out of
the room, running down the hallway towards the front door!
39

Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 39.

INT. HALLIE'S BEDROOM -- LATER 39

Blue and red lights reflect on the walls. Hallie watches from
her window as Katie's Father is gently placed in a POLICE
CAR.

Another text from Wren: No comment? U can clearly see him!
Outside, Hallie's Father is yelling at Katie's Father through
the police car window. Hallie's Mother is trying to restrain
her husband.

Hallie starts to type: Katie's Father was here...

But Hallie stops typing. She looks at Katie's Father
distraught and crumpled over in the back seat of the cruiser.

She deletes her typing.

EXT. SCHOOL - LOCKER AREA -- DAY

Hallie passes out flyers asking for leads on Katie’s
disappearance.

She comes upon Wren and Chloe with A BUNCH OF OTHER KIDS.
Hallie’s expression changes to nervous when she realizes Tom
is there. She avoids making eye contact.

Tom is looking at Chloe’s phone.

TOM
(to Chloe)
You didn't see anything at the
park? When you were taking the
video?

CHLOE
Just trees. The police said it’s
the light. Playing tricks.
TOM
Probably. It doesn’t really look
like anything...
Tom notices Hallie and smiles. Hallie smiles back.

WREN
Looks like something to me...

Naturally, Wren directs the conversation back to herself-
4l

Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 40.

WREN (CONT'D)
I mean... There are just things
that can’t be explained.

TOM
You guys really summoned Slender
Man?

CHLOE
Well, sort of... I guess.
(self-consciously)
Why?

KYLE
We chickened out--

TOM
(teases Kyle)
YOU chickened out!

The group laughs. Starts to break up. Hallie decides she
can’t keep it a secret any longer. Blurts out-

HALLIE
Katie’s Father broke into my house
last night.

Everyone turns at that news. WHAT?!
HALLIE (CONT'D)
He said some crazy shit about Katie
being into the occult. Then, he
blamed us for getting her into it.

Tom's intrigued. Wren and Chloe look stunned.

EXT. SCHOOL - LOCKER AREA -- LATER 41
Hallie walks away. Wren and Chloe stalk after her.

WREN
Why didn't you tell us about
Katie's Father?

HALLIE
I just did.

CHLOE
What did he mean about Katie being
“into the occult"?

HALLIE
Not sure. He was pretty wasted.
Blue Rev. (06/09/16) Al.

WREN
(excited)
Christ! She had that book in her
bag! About phantoms and stuff...
(beat)
This could be the next wrinkle in
the story...

HALLIE
I don't want to play this game.

WREN
If this is all a game, then where's
Katie?

That stops Hallie in her tracks.

WREN (CONT'D)
We know things nobody else knows.

HALLIE
What do we know?

WREN
We know that Katie was apparently
taking this paranormal shit very
seriously just before she
disappeared. We know she watched
that video.

HALLIE
What does that have to do with
anything?

WREN
Maybe Slender Man came for her...

Hallie scoffs.

HALLIE
Or, maybe she couldn’t take
Sergeant Drunk Dad anymore and ran
away--

WREN
And not say goodbye? To any of us?

A silent, but heavy beat. They all contemplate this for a
long moment.

WREN (CONT'D)
When we watched that video, it did
something to all of us. I felt it.
42

Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 42.

HALLIE
I didn't see anything.

CHLOE
I didn't see anything either, Wren.

WREN
I didn’t say I saw it... I felt it.
I think you did, too. I'm damn sure
Katie felt it. And that's why she
disappeared.

Hallie makes a sound like a snort. Wren imitates it back.

WREN (CONT'D)
That's your comeback? We have to
take this shit seriously! We have a
responsibility here...

Hallie looks conflicted.

EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET -- NIGHT 42

OMINOUS POV - As if something was watching through a twisted
thicket of trees. Hallie, Wren and Chloe stand under a street
lamp. A dim pool of light cutting through the darkness.

HALLIE
This is a bad idea.

The girls stare across the street to Katie's house.

The flicker of a TV glows in the front windows like deathly
pale eyes watching over a lawn that has gone to hell.

WREN
He’1ll be passed out by now.

CHLOE
What are you talking about?

WREN
Just a quick look around. There’s
gotta be something. A clue maybe-

HALLIE
Are you crazy? You didn’t see how
he was last night.

WREN
What’s the alternative? Do
nothing...
43

44

45

Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 43.

CHLOE
The back door’s always open.
(they look at her)
I’m just saying...
Wren starts across the street. Chloe’s right behind her.
Hallie pauses, her feet stuck to the curb.

She watches as the girls slip into darkness on the other side
the street. Then checks the block.

Neighboring houses sit in darkness, crickets chirping over
the silence.

THAT OMINOUS POV AGAIN - From behind the twisted branches,

Hallie steps quickly across the street, following the other
two before she changes her mind. The POV follows. Stalking
her from the trees.

EXT. KATIE’S HOUSE -- NIGHT 43

Wren moves quietly to one of the front windows. Chloe right
behind, step for step.

A moment later, Hallie appears. She looks over their
shoulders, anxiety dancing in her eyes.

WREN
(glances back)
Told you...
INT. KATIE’S LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT 44
We see them peek in from the darkness outside the window.
Mr. Jensen is slouched on the couch. A sickly wash of light
blankets him from the television. His head rests to the side,
clutching a half empty bottle of cheap vodka.
EXT. KATIE’S HOUSE -- NIGHT 45
Wren glances back at the other two with a slight grin.

Chloe and Hallie see it in her eyes.

“We’re doing this."
46

Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 44,

INT. KATIE'S HOUSE - REAR ENTRYWAY -- DAY 46
The doorknob turns on the back door. A slow CREAK as it
opens. Wren pokes her head in. The house is silent except for
the low drone from the TV. Underneath it, we can hear Mr.
Jensen snoring.

Wren carefully steps inside. Hallie and Chloe slip in behind.

They move quietly into a dark hallway stretching out in front
of them. As they pass the kitchen we see an OPEN PANTRY DOOR.

In the shadows, we can just make out a cluttered table and
chairs. The filthy sink is piled high with dishes.

Wren looks back at them with a “Can-you-believe-how-cool-this-—
is?” smile. She pauses near an entryway table. A framed
picture of Katie with her dad sits on top. Happier times.
They peek into the living room.

POV - Mr. Jensen lies on the couch, still snoring softly.
Wren turns to Hallie and Chloe, gives them the hush sign and
continues. As she turns, Wren bumps the entryway table,
knocking over the framed picture.

CLAP!!

IN THE SILENCE, IT’S LIKE A GUN SHOT.

MR. JENSEN IS STARTLED AWAKE.

MR. JENSEN
Katie?

The girls stand in silence, listening. Then as they slowly
start to back away...

A FLOORBOARD CREAKS UNDER THEIR FEET.
Confused, Mr. Jensen turns toward the sound...

THE GIRLS HEAR THE SPRINGS IN THE COUCH GROAN AS MR. JENSEN
PULLS HIMSELF TO HIS FEET.

He reaches for the SIDE TABLE DRAWER. Slides it open to
reveal...

A GUN!

He grabs it. And revolver poised, cautiously heads in the
direction of the noise he heard.
Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 45.

The girls recoil and track back down the hallway.

MR. JENSEN (0.S.) (CONT'D)
Who’s there?

The girls duck into the kitchen.
One hiding place. The open pantry.

They all try to pile in, but it’s too small. The girls argue
in a frantic whisper.

We hear Mr. Jensen’s heavy boots clunk on the hollow wooden
floor in the front of the house.

Wren leaves them and backtracks into the hallway.
MR. JENSEN (0.S.) (CONT'D)
(voice booming)
Who’s there?

Wren glances back.

She sees Mr. Jensen’s shadow stretch out from the living room
onto the floor in the hallway. His footsteps approaching.

Ten feet seem like a hundred as Wren turns to the back door.
Mr. Jensen, gun in hand, rounds the corner to the hallway.
WHERE WREN WAS JUST A SPLIT SECOND BEFORE.

It’s empty. She’s gone.

INSIDE THE PANTRY: Chloe and Hallie hear heavy measured
footsteps moving closer. They hear Mr. Jensen step into the
kitchen and stop just outside the pantry door. The girls can

hear the man’s heavy breaths.

They're frozen. Trapped. The girls peer through the downward
slats of the door as Mr. Jensen makes his way in.

Oh shit...THEY SEE HIS GUN!!!

Mr. Jensen scans the darkness in the kitchen. It’s difficult
to make out much detail, but he can see it’s empty.

INSIDE THE PANTRY: Chloe and Hallie hold perfectly still. Not
breathing. Eyes wide. On that gun. Scared to death...

MR. JENSEN FOCUSES ON THE PANTRY DOOR.

Slowly...
Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 46.

INSIDE THE PANTRY: The girls see him raise the gun, as he
steps towards them. They back up as far as they can from the
door. Now only his boots are visible.

THE BOOTS STOP JUST OUTSIDE THE DOOR...

WHEN A CHIME SHATTERS THE SILENCE!

THE DOORBELL.

Mr. Jensen shudders, spinning in the direction of the front
door. But his attention is quickly back on the possible
intruders.

The sound that woke him. What he thought he heard. Then...
THE DOORBELL RINGS AGAIN!

A long beat. Mr. Jensen slowly pulls the gun up and retreats.
Heading to the door.

INSIDE THE PANTRY: Hallie and Chloe listen as the footsteps
pound away from them. They finally exhale.

Mr. Jensen looks through the front window. He sees who it is
and tucks the gun behind his back.

He steps over and opens the door to reveal...

MR. JENSEN (CONT'D)
Wren?

WREN
Hi, Mr. Jensen.

She glances briefly over Mr. Jensen’s shoulder. In the
background, Hallie and Chloe quickly leave the pantry. Head
in the opposite direction.

Hallie goes straight for the back door. But Chloe pulls her
towards Katie’s room.

MR. JENSEN
What are you doing here?

WREN
I just wanted to see if there’s
something I can do. If I can help
in any way...

Again, her eyes drift over his shoulder.

OFF WREN’S LOOK, Mr. Jensen glances back just as the girls
disappear into Katie’s room. All he sees is an empty hallway.
47

Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 47.

He turns back to Wren.

MR. JENSEN
How?

He stares at her with bloodshot eyes, the emotion building
just under the surface.

MR. JENSEN (CONT'D)
(hopeless)
What can you do?

WREN
I was hoping you'd tell me.

INT. KATIE'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 47

Both girls enter and just stand there for a moment. Feeling
the weight of this violation.

There is nothing feminine about the bare-bones room. No
frills. A mess of clothes and junk. Blank walls. A simple bed
sits opposite a little desk.

HALLIE
(whispers)
She's really gone.

CHLOE
I know.

Hallie crosses to Katie's desk where a tangle of cables lie
like severed limbs.

CHLOE (CONT'D)
The police must've taken her
desktop.

Hallie looks more closely. She eyes A FEW BOOKS that surround
an empty spot where the computer was.

ON THE COVER OF ONE OF THE BOOKS: A repulsive scaly creature
curls around itself. Horns and a tail. One clawed hand hides
its entire face.

Hallie’s gaze shifts to a crude sketch on a scrap of paper.
CLOSE ON: A strange, abstract drawing.

- A chaotic mess of penciled strokes depict a tall, thin
human-like figure. Its elongated arms hang slack at its

sides. A smaller figure is roughed out next to it. An arm
from each figure overlap. Like they’re connected...
Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 48.

- LIKE A TALL, THIN MONSTER HOLDING A CHILD’S HAND...
THE MURMUR OF VOICES IN THE NEXT ROOM GROWS LOUDER.
Heavy footsteps in the hallway head towards us.
Hallie and Chloe focus on the closed bedroom door. Frozen.
HALLIE
(whispers)
Shit!
There’s definitely no way out.
The murmurs evolve into muffled words as they get closer.
MR. JENSEN (0.S.)
.+.-you can see what they did. They
took her stuff--
A bead of sweat rolls down Hallie’s forehead.
WREN (0.S.)
(quickly)
Mr. Jensen. Could I have a glass of
water?

Chloe and Hallie listen as the footsteps pause.

They back away, retreating down the hallway. Their muffled
words dissolve back into a garbled murmur.

The two girls exhale, quickly returning to their search.
Hallie opens Katie's closet.

A confusion of clothes and shoes cover the floor. A few
things still dangle from their hangers.

Hallie shoves them aside, checking the wall inside.
HALLIE
She kept cigarettes and stuff in
here...
She pulls a section of paneling away from the wall.
KATIE’S LAPTOP.

She lifts it out as Chloe comes over. Wide-eyed-

CHLOE
Let’s just take it.
48

Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 49.

Hallie looks surprised. Chloe's surprised herself. She moves
to the bedroom door and carefully opens it.

As the girls step out, they see Wren and Mr. Jensen's shadow
stretching out into the hallway. And hear Katie’s Father
quietly sobbing...

INT. CHLOE'S BEDROOM -- DAY 48
Hallie, Wren and Chloe are gathered around Katie's laptop.

WREN
Katie was using Tor? I didn't think
she was techie enough for that.
It's pretty basic, but still. This
is like deep-web, dark-net-type
shit.

CHLOE
Isn't that like...where people buy
drugs and guns online?

WREN
Among other things...

Wren clicks on the web history in the browser.

- A massive list populates. All strange headings. Devil
worship, evil spirits, black magic, witchcraft.

WREN (CONT'D)
Here’s the last site she visited.

- The untitled link is a string numbers separated by periods.
There is no “www.” or “.com”.

She clicks it and a website appears.

- No header. No splash page. Just a dark black background. In
the center, a simple text box with A BLINKING CURSOR.

CHLOE
It looks like you need a password.

HALLIE
Cydonia66. She uses it for
everything.

WREN
She still likes Muse?

Hallie shrugs.
Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 50.

Wren tries the password.

- The text box disappears and THREE RED CIRCLES materialize
in its place...

CHLOE
Now what?

- Just as quickly, the circles dissolve into FIVE TRIANGLES.

CHLOE (CONT'D)
Is this a game?

- The triangles fade as EIGHT SQUARES appear. The sequence
ends with small empty box.

- A CURSOR FLASHES.

HALLIE
It’s a puzzle.

CHLOE
Circle, triangle, square...

WREN
Octagon? Trapezoid?

Hallie gives a little smirk.

HALLIE
No, it’s a number.

Hallie reaches in and presses enter.

- The cycle repeats. Three circles. Five triangles. Eight
Squares...

- The cursor just sits there. Blinking. Taunting them.

HALLIE (CONT'D)
Thirteen!

Wren and Chloe look at her, confused.
HALLIE (CONT'D)
THREE plus FIVE is Eight. FIVE plus
EIGHT is THIRTEEN
She types in the UNLUCKY NUMBER.

- Now a new screen loads.

WREN
I didn't know you were a math geek.
Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 51.

HALLIE
I'm not... Not really.
(like a confession)
I just do well in a test
environment.

- A series of odd names and dates scroll onto the page. Basic
red-colored text, underlined on a black background.

WREN
What am I looking at?

HALLIE
Alton is in Illinois. These are all
town names and dates. Click one...

Wren clicks on one of the links.

- A VIDEO OPENS: We see the ground. Weeds and dirt. Grainy

and low res. The camera shakes, flashing across the sky and
back again. When it steadies, we see children playing on a

playground.

- But the moment we hear laughter and excitement, the video
pauses. Goes silent. The children frozen in time.

- AND IN THE BACKGROUND, out of focus, there’s an indistinct
human shape. Tall and thin with an unsettling posture. Its
head slumped to one side. Long arms hanging down at its
sides...

-— THEN THE IMAGE DISTORTS.

A HIGH PITCHED SHRILL explodes from the speakers. All three
flinch as the image cuts out.

HALLIE (CONT'D)
shit!

CHLOE
What was that?

HALLIE
Click on a different one.

Wren does.

- A STILL IMAGE: A canted angle in the forest at night. A
hurried composition. The nearby foliage is bleached from the
camera’s flash. The light quickly falls off into a darkened
path between trees.

WREN
It’s him...
Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 52.

Silence fill the room as the girls lean in closer.

- At the end of a path, a man. His strange narrow frame
sketched in moonlight filtering down from above. Barely
visible, but definitely there. Arms the length of his body
extend towards us.

CHLOE
I don’t like this.

Wren closes the haunting image.

HALLIE
Look!

She point to a chat box at the bottom of the page. Wren
scrolls through the feed.

WREN
AlleyKat93? Jeeze. They went back
and forth like a hundred times...

Wren expands the feed.

HALLIE
(reading)
"I knew he was there before I saw
him. Did he have hands for you?"
What? Did he have hands for you?

WREN
(excited)
It's like they're comparing
experiences. All these places and
dates. I wonder if they're all
Slender Man sightings.

CHLOE
Wait. Look... Katie posted a video.

Wren clicks on the link.

- A VIDEO OPENS: Katie stands in the woods. She holds up her
phone like she’s taking a selfie, but not smiling. She walks
Slowly through the trees. The forest whirls around her as she
makes her way. Her eyes empty, void of emotion.

ON THE GIRLS - Transfixed on the secret video of their
friend. And then their faces change. Eyes widening as a wave
of dread washes over them.

The video ends and they look at each other-
49

Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 53.

WREN
What was that?
HALLIE
What did you see?
WREN
What did you see?
HALLIE
I don't know.
CHLOE
I don't know either... Maybe

nothing?

We hear the denial in their words. Nobody wants to say it out
loud, but it’s clear.

They all saw something.

INT. HALLIE'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 49

A lamp on the bedside table warms the room. Hallie lies back
looks at her phone. The blue glow lights her face.

- ON THE PHONE: Three circles turn to triangles, then
squares. Hallie types “13”.

A wrinkle of concern appears on her brow as she waits for the
page to load. We watch her scroll down the sparse web page.
With a couple of taps, Katie’s video appears.

Hallie presses play...

- ON SCREEN: Katie’s face, staring into camera. The forest
swirls around her as she winds her way through the trees.

Hallie watches closer now. Waiting. And then a look of
recognition in her eyes.

Now we see what they saw before. Behind Katie...

- SLENDER MAN. OBSCURED BY THE OVERGROWN FOREST. BUT
DEFINITELY THERE.

- Katie stops walking. She clearly knows he's behind her.
Eyes wide with fear. But she doesn't take them off the iPhone
in her hand. Not even as the figure slowly starts to come
closer...and closer...

Hallie helplessly watches what unfolds before her eyes.
50

51

Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 54,

- The towering figure approaches Katie from behind. He moves
through the underbrush, almost floating. The branches
scraping and snapping around his body. The long arms hanging
down horribly at his sides as he moves effortlessly.

- As he comes closer and closer, we just start to make out
what should be his face. Instead, just a lifeless empty void.

WHISPERED VOICE (0.S.)
Hallie...

Hallie looks up from her phone. Listening.
She stands and crosses over to the door. Opens it. Peers out.

HALLIE’S POV - The dark hallway sits in silence outside her
room.

But, just as she goes to close her door, she hears the voice
again. Like a distant call.

VOICE (0.S.)
Hallie...

It’s a voice we recognize.

HALLIE
Katie?

Slowly, she steps into the hallway.

INT. HALLIE’S HOUSE - HALLWAY -- CONTINUOUS 50
Hallie steps softly down the empty hall. The house around her
is so quiet we can hear her feet pad lightly on the floor.
She heads towards the back of the house, but as she
approaches the end of the hall we hear tiny sounds outside.
Hallie peeks around the corner.

THE BACK DOOR IS WIDE OPEN.

The sounds of night filter in. Crickets chirping.

KATIE (0.S.)
Hallie...

Katie’s voice floats in on a gentle breeze from outside.

EXT. HALLIE’S HOUSE -- NIGHT 51

Hallie steps out searching the darkness in the backyard.
52

Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 55.

KATIE (0.S.)
(louder)
Hallie.

Hallie’s looks to the trees beyond and quickens her pace.

EXT. TREES - CONTINUOUS 52

Moonlight fights through the canopy above. A heavy mist rolls
through the trees in front of her.

HALLIE
Katie? Is that you?

Her voice just carries into the woods and disappears.

She continues into the darkness. The forest becoming more and
more dense. She slips under branches that block her way, and
steps over a fallen tree. Its trunk is stained a sulphurous
yellow by disease.

And just as her foot touches the forest floor...

A LOUD WHISPER IN HALLIE’S EAR!

KATIE (0.S.)
Hallie...

Hallie spins around. A chill running down her spine as she
searches the blackness all around her.

WE SEE KATIE PASS IN THE DISTANCE

But only for a moment. Then she disappears into the fog
drifting between trees.

Hallie follows, moving deeper into the woods. She steps
quickly, twigs snapping under her feet.

HALLIE
Katie!

She's running now towards the tree where Katie slipped away.
Hallie reaches it and looks around.
Nothing. Only empty forest.

HALLIE (CONT'D)
Katie! Come back...

WE HEAR WHISPERED VOICES ECHOING IN THE DISTANCE.
Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 56.
VOICES (0.S.)
Hallie...Hallie...

Hallie searches, but can’t locate them. She is surrounded by
an endless forest that leads into darkness.

CRACK! A branch breaks nearby.

Hallie spins towards the sound.

HALLIE’S POV - A fogged path through the trees.
CRACK!! Another broken branch echoes in the distance.
Hallie stands frozen. Staring.

HALLIE’S POV - We see movement behind the fog. Between the
trees. Slowly growing. Closer and closer until...

CRASH!!
Tree branches thrash against each other in the dark haze.
Hallie stumbles, backpedaling.

Suddenly, something is visible through the fog. A thin shape
moving through the tree branches.

SOMETHING IS WALKING TOWARDS US!

Hallie turns to run, her feet pounding back towards the
house. She glances back...

HALLIE’S POV - Something tall and thin moves through the fog.
MOVING TOWARDS HER! !

We see panic spark in her eyes as she quickens her pace.
TWIGS AND BRANCHES SNAP BEHIND HER. LOUDER AND LOUDER...
Hallie glances back, now in a dead run....

HALLIE’S POV - The tall, thin shape closes in. It’s still
hidden in the haze, but we can almost make it out. It’s a
towering human-like figure.

Hallie tries to run faster. But the harder she runs, the less
ground she seems to cover. A savage wail escapes her throat

as she scrambles forward. But it’s no use.

Her feet pound the forest floor. But each step forward
somehow pulls her deeper into the forest. Almost sliding...
Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 57.

AS IF AN INVISIBLE FORCE IS PULLING HER BACKWARDS!
In desperation, she dives forward and slams to the ground.
She claws into the earth, trying to hold her ground. Trying
to crawl away. Then, suddenly...
A WAVE OF SILENCE.
All we hear are Hallie’s panicked, painful breaths.
She looks back and scans the forest.
DEEP VOICE
(distorted)
Hallie...
HALLIE RECOILS, SPINNING AROUND.
THEN HORROR IN HER EYES WHEN SHE SEES...
LONG THIN ARMS REACH DOWN FROM ABOVE.

TWO PALE HANDS GRAB HER!

INT. HALLIE’S BEDROOM -- NIGHT
A BONE CHILLING SCREAM!!!
HALLIE’S BODY JOLTS AWAKE!!

FOR A MOMENT SHE CAN'T STOP SCREAMING! AS IF SOMETHING HAS
HER. HER EYES DARTING AROUND THE ROOM, SEARCHING...

Her cell phone falls from her hand and tumbles onto the floor
just as the door to the bedroom slams open.

HALLIE’S FATHER
What is it?!

Hallie’s parents burst into the room. Her Father quickly
scans the space.

HALLIE’S MOTHER
Hallie, what’s the matter?

Hallie still can’t speak or catch her breath. Her Mother
scrambles over to the bed.

HALLIE’S MOTHER (CONT’D)
Hallie!

HALLIE’S FATHER
There’s nobody here, Hal...
Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 58.

Hallie snaps out of it, like the end of a trance. She looks
around the room as if her parents had come out of nowhere.

Lizzie appears in the doorway behind them, a worried look on
her face.

LIZZIE
What’s going on?
Hallie’s breathing slowly returns as her family looks on. Her
heart stops pounding. The fear fades from her eyes as she
calms and finally takes a deep breath.

HALLIE
Just a nightmare.

HALLIE’S MOTHER
Jeeze, I guess so.

HALLIE’S FATHER
Scared the hell out of me...

LIZZIE
Weirdo.

Lizzie just does an about-face and disappears into the hall.
Hallie’s mother offers a hug.

HALLIE’S MOTHER
Are you okay?

HALLIE
Yeah, sorry.

HALLIE’S FATHER
It’s okay, Kiddo.

Hallie gives an uneasy smile and watches as her parents make
their way out of the room.

The house grows quiet again as a blanket of silence sets in
around her. Hallie looks down at her phone on the floor.

- That same video of Katie still plays. She just stares into
the camera with dead eyes. Winding her way through the trees.
Waiting for him...

Hallie quickly grabs it and taps the screen.

The video disappears and the screen goes dark.
Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 59.

INT. WREN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

Wren sits in her room staring at something opposite her bed.
There’s a nervousness in her eyes. She focuses as the nerves
turn to determination.

Across the room sitting on her desk, is Katie’s laptop. The
little green power light blinking. Calling to her.

Wren jumps from her bed. Wakes the computer. And types
quickly. Before she loses the courage.

- ON SCREEN: The small empty box on a black background
waiting for the UNLUCKY NUMBER.

She types it in. 13.

- The list of names and dates load onto the page. The same
basic text, red and underlined.

Wren pauses.

- We scroll through and click on a link. The same link from
before. The one Katie posted.

ON SCREEN: The video loads. That huge close-up of Katie's
face. Eyes wide.

Wren watches, listening to the leaves crunch under Katie’s
feet as she meanders through the woods.

We know what comes next...
DING!

- An IM pops up in the chat box below. Simple like a
programers prompt. The name AlleyKat93 next to it...

Wren hits PAUSE. Reads...

- Letters appear in succession. Forming two words...
- “What’s up?”

- The prompt drops down waiting. The cursor blinking.
Wren studies it for a moment.

- She quickly types: This is a friend of Katie’s. The cursor
blinks. A slow rhythm on and off.

- AlleyKat93 responds: Then you’re a friend of mine.

A little smile. Wren takes that as encouragement.
53

Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 60.

- Types: She’s missing.

- AlleyKat93: Of course she is.

- Wren: What did you tell her?

- AlleyKat93, immediately: What she wanted to know...
Wren holds off, considering the cryptic message.

- Wren: Which was?

- AlleyKat93: The same thing you want to know.

Wren's mouth drops open a bit, as if she’s going to say
something...

WREN (PRE-LAP)
I talked to her...

EXT. SCHOOL - LOCKER AREA -- DAY 53

Fueled by caffeine and nerves, Wren tries to download Hallie
and Chloe as fast as she can.

HALLIE
Who?

WREN
"AlleyKat93." The girl Katie was
talking to on that site. I went on
there and sent her a message and
she answered me!

CHLOE
(incredulous)
You went back on that website?

WREN
It doesn’t matter. Once you see
him, you can't unsee him...

HALLIE
What are you talking about?

WREN
Slender Man! She told me
everything. He gets in your head.
Like a virus.

CHLOE
What kind of virus?
Wren sees
effort-

Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 61.

WREN
(emphatic)
Like a virus on your computer. That
infects your hard drive. Only it’s
your brain!

HALLIE
Wren, slow down...

WREN
She said once the virus takes hold,
he’s got you! Some he haunts. Some
he drives mad. Others he takes.
Like...

CHLOE
Like what?

WREN
Like Katie.

a dubious look on Hallie’s face. Redoubles her

WREN (CONT'D)
I know it sounds crazy, but
AlleyKat says we can UNVEIL
OURSELVES. If we surrender
something to him. Something that
reveals our true selves...

CHLOE
What the does hell does that mean?

Wren pauses for dramatic effect.

The girls
sinks in.

WREN
We can contact Slender Man.

study Wren as the weight of what she’s proposing
HALLIE
Why the hell would we do that?

WREN
To get Katie back. Hello?

She says that like it's the clincher.

HALLIE
(still dubious)
Ask Slender Man?
Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 62.

WREN
AlleyKat said Katie did it and the
next day she was gone.

HALLIE
Katie asked Slender Man to take
her?

CHLOE
No way.

WREN

She was always talking about
running away...

The girls digest.

WREN (CONT'D)
Look, even if the odds are a
million to one any of this is
real... That Slender Man has
anything to do with Katie’s
disappearance. We owe it to her to
try.

Hallie and Chloe consider this.

CHLOE
(dawns on her)
But what if it is real?

WREN
Then we have to do this because we
all got into this shit together. I
mean Katie is our best friend. And
we're the only ones who might be
able to help her...

HALLIE
This is insane.

WREN
Maybe... Who’s in?

Wren says it like that's the final selling point.

54 INT. HALLIE'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 54

Hallie looks at the many TRACK AWARDS on her dresser.
55

Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 63.

WREN (0.S.)

It has to be a true sacrifice.
AlleyKat said it can’t just be
anything. It has to be important to
you. Something you love...

Hallie steps over to her dresser, but instead opens the top
drawer. She lifts out an old tattered white scarf.

Red words are embroidered at one of the frayed ends...

“From the same garden, different flowers bloom.”

EXT. BACK ROAD -- NIGHT 55

Wren walks along a quiet street. A lone street lamp over
powers the moonlight. She follows the treeline, Hallie and
Chloe a couple of steps behind.

Their shadows stretch out before them as they plot a course
through the scrub brush. We watch as they make their way out
of the light and into the trees.

We see a flashlight click on and watch as they disappear into
the darkness beyond.

EXT. PUBLIC FOREST -- NIGHT

Tree limbs and branches crack and break the silence as the
girls fight their way into the forest. Leaves crunch under
their feet. Each of their steps drum to a different, but
steady beat.

Wren’s torch forages the path ahead, rolling over fallen and
decomposing trees. Hallie and Chloe follow close behind.

In the distance, we can make out a hint of light. A clearing
in the forest that allows moonlight to filter down.

The girls emerge from a thicket of undergrowth, the
flashlight searching the open area.

Wren spotlights a massive stump of a tree that decomposed
long ago. Bark falling down the sides. Rotten and jagged.

WREN
This should work.

The girls approach the makeshift altar. The light in Wren’s
hand is the only relief from the darkness surrounding them.
Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 64.

A dampened silence closes in as the girls form a circle
around the tree stump. Wren reaches into her bag and pulls
out a CERAMIC MONSTROSITY.

WREN (CONT'D)
I made this in pottery class when I
was five. It was supposed to be a
coffee mug for my mother. She used
it as an ashtray once. But I still
always loved it, so it'll count.

Wren sets it on the ground and grabs a rock. She smashes the
misshapen mug and gathers the pieces. She dumps the debris
into a decayed opening in the center of the stump. She looks
to Chloe to go next.

Chloe holds up A PHOTO: A picture of man and a little girl.

CHLOE
This is the only picture I have of
me with my dad. There are other
photos of him floating around
online. Trips he took with his new
girlfriend, things like that. This
is the only one where we're
together.

She tears the photo into tiny pieces and scatters them over
the broken ceramic shards in the damp, rotten hole.

Hallie realizes it's her turn. She shows everyone the white
scarf. We see the embroidered description above the ragged
and frayed end.

“From the same garden, different flowers bloom.”

HALLIE
My grandmother made this when
Lizzie was born. She gave it to me
before she died. That was over 8
years ago, but I still really miss
her.

She pulls a thread on the frayed edge of the scarf. It
quickly unravels, eating away at the fabric. It snags on the
embroidered words as they disappear and fall away.

WREN
(snarky)
I thought you'd bring one of your
trophies. Or medals...
Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 65.

HALLIE
You said it had to be something I
cared about.

Touche. Hallie places the wadded yarn and scarf with the
rest.

Wren scoops up a handful of dirt and covers their offering.

WREN
(calling out)
This is our unveiling. We surrender
these items so that we may reveal
our true selves.

CHLOE
Anyone else feel like and idiot, or
is it just me?

Hallie and Chloe exchange a look, and Chloe snickers.

Wren glares at them and places her iPad over the sacrificial
items in the decayed hallow of the tree.

ON SCREEN: A PHOTO OF KATIE.

WREN
(looks at the others)
Lights out.

Wren clicks off her flashlight.

The moonlight now sketches their outlines against the
darkened forest.

Wren steps over and blindfolds Hallie with a necktie. Then
Chloe. She's about to blindfold herself when she catches
Hallie and Chloe peeking.

WREN (CONT'D)

AlleyKat said not to look at him.
When we ask for Katie’s return, we
have to keep our blindfolds on...

CHLOE
Why? Isn’t it dark enough?
HALLIE
Yeah. I’m not doing the blindfold

thing...

Wren gives them a disapproving look.
Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 66.

WREN
Fine. Let’s all just leave. Forget
it. If you don’t want Katie back...

CHLOE
Fine. Whatever. This is so lame.

Wren’s called their bluff. The girls adjust their blindfolds.
Wren puts hers on.

The girls reach for each other and hold hands. Then awkwardly
form a circle as they sit on the ground.

Now only darkness and forest sounds surround them. Crickets
chirping. Leaves falling softly on the ground. A gentle wind
rustles the treetops high above.

HALLIE

How long are we going to give this?
WREN

As long as it takes.
HALLIE

Not as LONG as it takes.
WREN

You haven't given it any time yet.
CHLOE

(sarcastically)

Yeah, Hallie, come on.
They're quiet, for a second.

HALLIE
Blow me.

Chloe giggles.

WREN
Come on!

They're all quiet again. Crickets continue to chirp. Leaves
continue to rustle...

UNTIL SUDDENLY THE WIND STOPS! AND THE WOODS AROUND THEM. THE
CRICKETS STOP CHIRPING. THE LEAVES STOP RUSTLING.

Freaked out, Chloe reaches for her blindfold. Wren senses it.

WREN (CONT'D)
Keep your blindfolds on!
Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 67.

The girl’s heads turn blindly toward each other in the
inexplicable quiet.

A moment later, soft and far way...floating on a gentle
breeze...

A BELL ECHOES IN THE FOREST.

HALLIE
Did you hear that?

CHLOE
Hear what?

WREN
Shhh!

Then like a tiny whisper...a blanketed sound...

A LONG, FAINT CHIME RESONATES, CARRYING OUT FROM SOMEWHERE
DEEP IN THE DARKENED WOODS.

Goosebumps. The girls all turn towards the sound. Listening.
The temptation to remove the blindfolds grows as they clasp
their hands tighter.

HALLIE
(whispering)
Did you guys hear that?
CHLOE
(voice shaking)
We shouldn't be doing this!

HALLIE
She's right--

WREN
It’s too late...

Hallie and Chloe both reach towards their blindfolds, pulling
away. But Wren tightens her grip on their hands.

WREN (CONT'D)
Leave your blindfolds on! It’s
started. We have to keep them on!!!
THEN A SILENCE LOUDER THAN BEFORE...

A stillness...as if the forest were frozen in time...the
absence of sound exploding in the girls’ ears.

And then they hear it again!
Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 68.

A BELL TOLLS! !

THE FINAL CALL. A DEEP, LOW, TONE OSCILLATES AND ECHOES
THROUGH THE TREES.

The girls shudder as the sound swells and fills their ears.

WREN (CONT'D)
Keep the blindfolds on!!

But Chloe finally can’t take it anymore. She lowers her
blindfold just enough to see SOMETHING! Suddenly her face
goes white and...

SHE SCREAMS!!!

And bolts from the circle! Into the woods...

WREN AND HALLIE TEAR OFF THEIR BLINDFOLDS! NOT SURE WHAT THE
HELL IS GOING ON! THEY JUMP TO THEIR FEET WITH LITTLE CHOICE
BUT TO CHASE AFTER THEIR FRIEND..

WREN/HALLIE
No!! Chloe!!! Come back!

Wren grabs the flashlight and flicks it on. The beam splashes
across a wall of trees as they run towards the edge of the
clearing.

- PICK UP ON CHLOE DEEP IN THE WOODS.

She runs for her life, racing past low-hanging branches that
snap at her legs.

- ON WREN AND HALLIE

The two weave through the trees, the flashlight leading the
way. The underbrush snags on their clothes like thin little
fingers. Tiny grabbing hands.

Wren steps past a tree and cuts left as Hallie wrestles with
one of the branches trying to keep up.

- ON CHLOE

She fights through a thicket of thorned branches and finds an
opening between trees.

Chloe ducks through and...
THWACK! She runs smack into a tree and falls to the ground.

But it’s not a tree.
Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 69.

Chloe gets up.
IT’S A TALL, SLENDER MAN STANDING RIGHT IN FRONT OF HER!

His torso is dark and black, like coal. His face white. A
blank where his features should be.

He "stares" at her. Without eyes.

His long arms raise and reach for her...

Chloe’s heart races, but she can’t move. Body rigid.
Paralyzed. She can’t look away. Staring back at the man
towering above her.

She begins to...

SCREAM!

And we...

CUT TO ANOTHER PART OF THE WOODS

- ON WREN

Wren rushes along searching frantically.

THEN SHE HEARS CHLOE’S SCREAM ECHO THROUGH THE FOREST.

She circles back with the flashlight.

WE SEE SHE IS ALONE NOW. HALLIE IS GONE!

She looks around, fearful. Panicked breaths. The flashlight
casting long shadows from the trees that stretch out into the
darkness all around her.

THEN SHE HEARS SOMETHING IN THE BRUSH! COMING HER WAY! FAST!
Wren braces herself...

SCREAMS !

BUT IT’S HALLIE WHO BURSTS OUT OF THE TREES! SCREAMING TOO!
Realizing they’re okay, the girls struggle to catch their
breath. They hold onto each other, scanning the darkness.
Their breathing like stuttered gasps.

Then a sound! Like distant CHIMES.

The girls look at each other...
Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 70.
The chimes become clearer. Like a RING TONE. It grows louder
and louder.

HALLIE
That's Chloe's phone.

Just as Hallie says this, her own phone RINGS! She jumps,
grabbing at her pocket.

Now Wren's phone starts RINGING, too!

The three tones coalesce. Blending into a hideous song
echoing in their ears.

Hallie looks: Unknown caller.
She hesitates, then answers...
HALLIE (CONT'D)
(into phone)
Hello?
Silence on the other end.
Wren answers her phone now. Puts it on SPEAKER:
WREN
(into phone)
Yes?
A SCREAM COMES OVER THE LINE!
THE SCREAM EVOLVES INTO VOICES THAT SOUND EERILY FAMILIAR...
It’s Wren’s own voice and Hallie’s...

",..Do you hear that? ...That's Chloe's phone..."

HALLIE
What the hell? Where's Chloe?!

WREN
I don't know. She just started
running. Like something spooked
her. I told that stupid bitch to
keep her blindfold on!

HALLIE
Did you see anything back there?

WREN
I’m not sure.

Hallie calls through the trees.
Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 71.
HALLIE
Chloe? ...Chloe?!
Wren starts calling for her, too.

WREN
Chloe?!!

Their voices bounce around the forest and fades away.

Then silence returns to our ears. That same absence of sound.
No crickets chirping. No wind rustling the leaves.

CRACK!

A branch breaks in the darkness.

THEN A FAINT MURMUR COMES FROM THE WOODS!
Wren grabs Hallie by the arm.

WREN (CONT'D)
What is that?

THEN ANOTHER MURMUR FROM THE WOODS!

They both hear it now...Could it be Chloe?
CRACK!

Hallie and Wren stumble back away from the sound.
CRACK! !

Almost running now, they fight through brambles and low
hanging branches.

They finally push through, falling to the ground in the
middle of a small trail. Out in the open!

Wren focuses the flashlight in front of them, as they
scramble back to their feet...

CRACK!!!

A BRANCH BREAKS AND FALLS TO THE GROUND AND CHLOE CHARGES OUT
FROM BEHIND THE TREE.

The flashlight spotlights her. Dazed and barefoot, she
collapses on the path. She holds only one of her shoes.

HALLIE
Chloe! You okay?
Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 72.

Chloe looks up, a distant look in her eyes. Like a shell-
shocked veteran. Weathered and beaten.

WREN
Jesus, Chloe! You scared us to
death! Where’d you go?

CHLOE
(slowly)
I lost a shoe.
HALLIE
We thought something happened to

you...

But Chloe is obsessed with her search. She looks down at the
ground around her. Searching for her lost shoe.

WREN
Forget about your Goddamn shoe!

Then an awed look on Wren's face.

She shines the flashlight on Chloe’s face. Pupils open so
wide we can barely see the color of her eyes.

WREN (CONT'D)
You saw him...
EXT. STREET -- NIGHT
The girls walk home. Chloe lags behind.
HALLIE
(to Chloe)
Are you okay?

Chloe doesn’t make eye contact.

CHLOE
Yeah. I just freaked out.

WREN
What happened?

No response.
WREN (CONT'D)
I told you not to take off your
blindfold. Did you see him?

Finally, Chloe answers.
57

Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 73.

CHLOE
Nothing happened. I just got
scared, okay?

WREN
Something happened! Obviously.
You're lying. Why are you lying?
Chloe continues on. Tired of Wren's badgering.

HALLIE
Just let it die, Wren. Jesus.

Wren will have none of it.
WREN
She's lying and she knows it. Look
at her. Something happened back
there!
HALLIE
You're right. We didn’t get Katie
back. That’s what happened...
Wren wants to argue more but her street approaches.

WREN
I gotta go.

Wren walks off. Hallie and Chloe trudge on.

Hallie can see Chloe's still upset. Distracted. A million
miles away...

INT. HALLIE'S HOUSE - ENTRYWAY -- NIGHT 57

The front door opens and Hallie steps in. She pauses
listening...

The sound of the television filters in from the other room.
Her family carries on a carefree conversation, but she can’t
make out the words.

We see the exhaustion on Hallie’s face as she takes a deep
breath and heads into the living room.

INT. HALLIE’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

Her parents and Lizzie sit on the couch watching TV. She
moves quickly, trying to pass by unnoticed...

HALLIE'S MOTHER
Hallie?
58

Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 74.

But fails.

HALLIE’S FATHER
Hey sweetheart. How was practice?

Shit! Hallie’s eyes give it away. She forgot about track
practice. Covers...

HALLIE
Great!

Her Father smiles. Before this gets any worse, Hallie makes a
quick exit.

HALLIE (CONT'D)
I got some homework...

A wrinkle on Lizzie’s forehead shows she can sense something
is up...

INT. HALLIE'S BEDROOM -- LATER 58
The room is silent.

Hallie sits on the bed not reading from an opened textbook on
her lap. We can almost see the evening’s events playing back
in her mind.

Then a knock at her door.

LIZZIE (0.S.)
Hal?

Lizzie peeks in.
Hallie quickly pretends to be studying.

LIZZIE (CONT'D)
Can I come in?

Hallie puts on a smile for her little sister.

LIZZIE (CONT'D)
Everything all right?

HALLIE
Give me fifteen. Okay?

LIZZIE
Okay...

Lizzie steps back out. Shuts the door behind her.
59

Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 75.

Hallie picks up her cell. Calls Chloe. Gets voice mail.
HALLIE
(into phone)
Chlo, hey, I was just... Call me,
okay?

She hangs up. Unsettled. Isolated in her lonely bedroom.

INT. CHLOE'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 59
Chloe stares at her PHONE, pacing around the room.

MISSED CALL FROM HALLIE.

For a moment, she considers calling back. But only for a
moment. She fidgets with her hands, wringing them out. We see

a manic look in her eyes as she takes a deep breath.

Chloe opens the music player on her phone and plays a song. A
soothing rhythm fills the air.

She lays on her bed and closes her eyes. Trying to calm
herself. Deep breath after breath. She exhales pure anxiety,
but it helps. Another breath and we see the nerves calm.

We watch the tension release. Her body relaxing into the soft
bed beneath her.

THEN A HIGH PITCHED SOUND INTERRUPTS THE SONG! !

Chloe jumps. Her eyes pop open. Listening. But the song
continues. Like it didn’t happen.

Slowly she relaxes again, closing her eyes.

SUDDENLY THAT HIGH PITCHED SOUND AGAIN! AN EAR SHATTERING
NOTE! !

The sound shocks Chloe to her feet.
She grabs the phone and hits stop.

But it does nothing. She stamps at the screen and the sound
disappears.

Now just the same quiet song as before. Silence and relief as
she exhales.

At that same moment, her phone DINGS! There’s a blank message
with an attachment.
Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 76.
Chloe freezes, staring at the screen. Her finger hovering
over the attachment.
- SHE CLICKS ON TO SEE: A live-streaming view of her house.
Chloe can be seen in one of the windows. When she turns to
look out the window, the fear in her eyes is plainly visible.

Chloe sees nobody on the other side. Only black empty void.

- But her fear only grows as the stalking POV of the video
playing in her palm moves even closer to the house!

Chloe looks outside again. Still no one. Impossible.

- ON THE SCREEN: The POV stalks around the front of her
house. RIGHT UP TO THE FRONT DOOR!

-— THEN A MOMENT OF BLACK AND SOMEHOW THE MOVING POV IS INSIDE
THE HOUSE! TRACKING DOWN THE HALLWAY! !

Chloe rushes to her bedroom door. Again checks her phone:

- The relentless, unknown POV glides through the living room,
past her mother...CLOSER AND CLOSER.

THEN IT STOPS OUTSIDE CHLOE’S BEDROOM DOOR!

Chloe trembles as the "Mystery POV" stops shy. Waiting... She
hesitates. Then reaches slowly for her door knob and opens to
find...

The hallway is empty.

BUT THE IMAGE ON HER PHONE SHOWS: CHLOE IN HER OWN OPEN
DOORWAY! LOOKING AT HER PHONE...

-— THEN THAT HIGH PITCHED SOUND! !

- THE IMAGE CHANGES: A MEDIUM CLOSE-UP OF SLENDER MAN. INA
BLACK SUIT WITH A FACE THAT IS A FRANCIS BACON BLUR--

STANDING RIGHT BEHIND HER!
Chloe spins around...

But nothing is there. She drops the phone. Horrified. Only to
notice something on the back of her hand...

A dark red pulpy mass, spreading slowly.

Horrified, she scratches at it. Then feels something on her
arm. She pulls back her sleeve and gasps when she sees...
61

62

Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 77.
HER ARM IS BUBBLED OVER WITH LESIONS! THEY ARE SPREADING
QUICKLY! !

Hysterical she drops the phone and moves to the mirror in her
room. She looks...

THE LESIONS QUICKLY TRAVEL ACROSS HER NECK AND FACE.

Chloe looks down at her hands. Both completely covered. She
pulls up her shirt. They are everywhere. Horrified, she looks
back into the mirror.

THE DARK FIGURE STANDS RIGHT BEHIND HER IN THE REFLECTION!

Before she can even scream...

CUT TO:

EXT. SCHOOL - BELL TOWER-- DAY 61

As the sun creeps over the horizon, the bell RINGS to start a
new day.

INT. SCHOOL - CLASSROOM -- DAY 62

Hallie tries to concentrate. But struggles with a precalc
problem. She scratches out her work and starts over.

TOM (0.S.)
, (whispers)
Hey?

Hallie looks up to see Tom in the next row. He looks over at
Chloe’s EMPTY CHAIR.

TOM (CONT'D)
(whispers)

What’s up with Chloe? It’s been a

few days...

Hallie shrugs, now nervous and avoiding eye contact. Across
the way. Wren comes to the rescue...

WREN
(whispers)
She’s fine. Just a cold...
Tom nods and focuses back on his notebook.

Wren locks eyes with Hallie. Gives her a “Get your shit
together!” look.
63

Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 78.

EXT. SCHOOL - LOCKER AREA -- LATER 63

Hallie exits one of the school buildings. She texts Chloe. No
response. She continues walking, head buried in her phone
until...

TOM
Wait up...

Tom comes jogging up next to her. Hallie’s caught off guard.
TOM (CONT'D)

How you holding up? I mean with
Katie and all...

HALLIE
Uh, well, you know...
TOM
I got an idea that might cheer you
up.
HALLIE
You do?

Hallie can’t help smile, enjoying the newfound attention.
TOM
It’s Friday. We got the weekend
off. So I was thinking... We should
do something?

Hallie can't believe it. She tries to nod casually.
Miraculously, Tom doesn’t seem to notice how excited she is.

HALLIE
Sure... Why not? Cool.

Hallie glances away self-consciously, trying to hide the
giddiness. But it quickly fades when she sees...

THE TREELINE IN THE DISTANCE.

TOM
Want to hang out tonight?

Hallie doesn’t even hear the question.

THERE’S SOMETHING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SCHOOL’S CHAIN
LINK FENCE!
Cherry Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 79.

A tall dark silhouette. Static. Quietly staring. Too far away
to make out any detail. It looks like a man, but with
something spreading out from its sides.

LIKE TREE BRANCHES, BUT TANGLED AND MOVING.

TOM (0.S.) (CONT'D)
Hallie...

This turns Hallie’s attention back to Tom. Distracted, she
tries to play it off.

HALLIE
What?

TOM
You okay?

HALLIE

I mean, yeah. Your place?
Tom considers that victory.

TOM
Cool. See you later in Bio.

Hallie nods.

Tom starts to move off to some other friends and glances back
as if to wave goodbye. But Hallie’s attention has drifted
again into the distance.

Hallie refocuses on the treeline. The fence bordering the
school. The exact same spot the man was standing just a
moment before.

Nothing there now...

INT. SCHOOL LIBRARY - MAIN FLOOR -- DAY
A blanket of silence surrounds us.
Wren sits quietly typing at one of the library computers.

- ON THE SCREEN: Search results for “paranormal research
studies”. A list populates and we scroll through.

Wren spots an entry and writes down a call number. PN350.22

INT. SCHOOL LIBRARY - STACKS -- DAY

Books line the shelves deep in the stacks of the library.
Cherry Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 80.

Wren travels down an empty aisle, fingers trailing along the
books. It’s so quiet we can hear her fingers drag across the
spines. We can hear each footstep pad softly on the carpet.

Various titles slide by. She stops at the end of the aisle
and pulls one of the books.

BIOELECTRIC SYSTEMS AND THE PARANORMAL.

The binding groans as it opens. Hasn’t been touched in years.
Concentration on her face, as she flips through the pages.

A faint sound breaks the silence. CREAK-CREAK-CREAK-CREAK...

Wren listens as the sound grows louder. Repeating faster.
Then through the books, we see MOVEMENT ON THE OTHER SIDE.

Wren watches as the movement reaches her end of the aisle.
Now, only a few feet away. About to round the corner when...

A LIBRARIAN’S CART COMES INTO VIEW.
One last CREAK and it stops.

The LIBRARIAN grabs a book and slides it back onto a shelf.
Then he grabs the cart and wheels it away.

Silence again as Wren focuses back on the book. Then a
realization on her face as she skims the pages. She pulls her
phone from her pocket and quickly dials a number.
We listen with her as it rings...
Then a soft click. But no answer.
WREN
(whispering)

Hello? Chloe...?
Then a strange sound nearby. BZZZZ2Z2Z2T...
Wren looks down the aisle to a bank of fluorescent lights
flickering in the far corner. The buzzing grows louder as
they struggle to stay lit.

WREN’S POV - BZZZT! The light shorts out. A single spark
falls from the fixture.

Confusion on Wren’s face as she watches the tiny spark float
to the floor and snuff out on the carpet.

Wren turns to where the Librarian was just moments ago.
Cherry Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 81.

WREN (CONT'D)
(calling out)
Hey, the lights are-

BZZZZ2Z2Z2ZT!!! SPARKS BURST OUT OF THE NEXT BALLAST! THEY RAIN
DOWN, SMOLDERING ON THE CARPET!

Wren flinches as the far corner goes dark.
BZZT!! ANOTHER FIXTURE BURSTS!! THEN ANOTHER! !

THE LIGHTS SHORT OUT IN SEQUENCE, THE DARKNESS WORKING ITS
WAY ACROSS THE ROOM... TOWARDS WREN!!

Wren starts to back away, the book falling from her hands.

BOOM!! THE WHOLE FLOOR GOES DARK, EXCEPT FOR ONE LIGHT ABOVE
WREN’S HEAD...

Wren slowly looks up.

BZZZZT!! IT GOES OUT!!

COMPLETE DARKNESS!!

An involuntary scream escapes Wren’s throat. It carries out
into the empty void surrounding her. And then nothing. Only
silence. In a panic, she uses her phone as a flashlight and

scans the aisle behind her.

WREN’S POV - It’s too dark to make it out, but there is the
faint outline of a tall static figure at the other end.

IS SOMETHING STANDING THERE...?
Wren backs away.

WREN’S POV - THE TALL STATIC FIGURE JUST STANDS THERE...
STARING AT HER...

Wren strains to make it out. And then...
IT MOVES!! The figure slides towards us.

A FIGURE WE RECOGNIZE! TALL AND SLENDER!! HIDEOUSLY LONG ARMS
HANGING AT ITS SIDES!!

Wren screams and bolts out of the aisle.

WREN’S POV - The light from the phone reaches into blackness.
Spotlighting an endless row of books that leads into nothing.

Wren races through the darkness, the phone spotting the way
ahead. Books fly past, the light flashing across them.
Cherry Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 82.

THEN THE AISLE ENDS!!
She ducks into another aisle.

WREN (CONT'D)
Help!!

No answer. Her voice just carries out into darkness as she
races past the books.

THEN THAT AISLE ENDS!!

She turns another corner. Rows of books endlessly streaking
past. We hear Wren’s rapid breaths. Her footsteps pounding.

SHE REACHES THE END OF THE AISLE AGAIN!!
IT’S LIKE A MAZE IN THE DARK!! WHICH WAY!?

Wren flashes the light around her. Nothing but stacks of
books everywhere.

JUST LINES OF SHELVES LEADING INTO DARKNESS!!

Desperate, she just picks a direction. The light shakes as
she runs, only carrying a few strides ahead.

SUDDENLY, THE BEAM OF LIGHT FLASHES ACROSS SOMETHING...

THE FIGURE!!! A FREAKISHLY TALL MAN STANDING THERE IN THE
DARKNESS! LIKE HE WAS WAITING FOR HER!! HE WEARS A BLACK SUIT
AND TIE, STARING FROM A HORRIBLY BLANK, FEATURELESS FACE!!

Wren tries to stop and slides to the floor.

WE HEAR WREN’S BLOOD CURDLING SCREAM AS THE FIGURE MOVES
TOWARDS HER! ITS FACE EMITS A DISTORTED, EAR PIERCING SOUND!!

A chaotic sweep of light splashes across the figure as Wren
scrambles to her feet. She reverses direction, in a full
sprint. Only the phone spotting the way ahead.

Aisle after aisle fly past as she races aimlessly. Turning
right, turning left.

LOST IN THE MAZE, UNTIL...

SOMETHING SLIDES OUT IN FRONT OF HER!! WREN SLAMS INTO IT!!
BOOM!!!

EVERY FLUORESCENT FIXTURE ABOVE INSTANTLY BLAZES WITH LIGHT!!

Books fly in all directions as the darkness is washed away.
65

Cherry Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 83.

THE LIBRARIAN'S CART TUMBLES TO THE FLOOR IN FRONT OF HER.

The librarian stands frozen, book in hand. Eyes wide. Staring
at a raving lunatic.

LIBRARIAN
Young lady, are you okay?

Panting and out of breath, Wren quickly looks around.
EVERYTHING IS BACK TO NORMAL. Just a quiet library. Nothing
behind her. Nothing chasing her. Wren sits there, head
spinning. Catching her breath.

And then something catches her eye...

WREN’S POV: A book scattered on the floor.

“BIOELECTRIC SYSTEMS AND THE PARANORMAL”

Wren grabs it and scrambles to her feet.

The librarian stands in shock, just staring as Wren runs away
and disappears around the corner.

EXT. SCHOOL - P.E. FIELD -- DAY 65

Hallie is on her way to track practice. Wren marches up.
Obviously distraught.

WREN

You didn't get my messages?
HALLIE

My phone’s in my locker.
WREN

Okay... Please, just listen to me.

I ran all the way here.
Wren hands are TREMBLING. Hallie's never seen her like this.

WREN (CONT'D)
I understand now.

Hallie looks around. Not wanting to draw attention.
WREN (CONT'D)
What AlleyKat was trying to tell
me...it’s proof!

Wren shows Hallie the book from the library. She opens it to
a marked page.
Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 84.

WREN (CONT'D)
Paranormal contact with bioelectric
systems often result in a SYMBIOTIC
RELATIONSHIP. The effects on host
organisms have been well documented
and manifest in various forms...
personality change, bizarre
behavior, mental illness,
psychosis, loss of contact with
reality, hallucination, self
mutilation, suicide, and
NONSPECIFIC DISSOLUTION.

(looks at Hallie)
They just disappear.

People start to look their way.

HALLIE
Wren. Chill...

WREN
It’s exactly like AlleyKat said.
When you contact him, it becomes
part of you. Like a virus. But one
you can’t get rid of!

Wren tries to catch her breath.

WREN (CONT'D)
Has anything weird happened to you?
Anything strange?

Hallie hesitates. Wren sees it.

WREN (CONT'D)
Do not hold out on me bitch...

HALLIE
(whispers)
Okay. I was talking to Tom between
classes--

WREN
(negative)
Tom?

HALLIE
What’s wrong with Tom?

WREN
WHO GIVES A SHIT ABOUT TOM!
TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED?!
Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 85.

HALLIE
I thought I saw something in the
trees.

WREN

It was him.
Hallie protests.

HALLIE
I didn’t say that. It could have
been anything...

WREN
(please...)
It was him!
(beat)
What about Chloe? Have you talked
to her?

HALLIE
Her mom keeps saying she’s sick.
Last time I called, she pretty much
flat-out told me to stay away.

WREN
We need to go see her right now...

Hallie looks around.

HALLIE
I have practice. I can’t just leave-

WREN
(quote fingers)
I thought you didn’t care about
track?
With that Wren walks off. But tosses back for good measure-

WREN (CONT'D)
Call me when you grow a conscience.

Gauntlet thrown. Hallie thinks for a beat. Makes a
decision...

66 EXT. CHLOE’S HOUSE -- DAY 66
Near dusk. Hallie and Wren stand across from Chloe’s house.

Hallie pulls out her cell. Calls Chloe again. No answer. Now
texts her. No response.
Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 86.

WREN
Chloe hasn’t answered a single text
or call. You know that’s not like
her. Something’s definitely up. We
gotta talk to her...

HALLIE
Her mom’s gonna run interference.

WREN
Duh! That’s why we gotta go around
the side. Knock on her window,
moron...

Hallie nods “Okay”. And the two move toward the house.

As quietly as possible, they duck down beneath the living
room window. Peek in to see: Chloe's Mother sitting on a sofa
in a dim den. Her shoulders slumped in a wreath of cigarette
smoke.

They move on to Chloe’s room now. Wren cups her hands over
her eyes to see better. But no luck. She shakes her head.
Can’t see anything. Until...

CHLOE POPS UP IN THE WINDOW RIGHT ABOVE THEM!

SHE LOOKS INSANE! DARK CIRCLES UNDER HER EYES! EMACIATED AND
PALE! LIKE A LIVING SKELETON...

AND DOESN’T SEEM TO NOTICE HER FRIENDS! IN FACT, LOOKS RIGHT
THROUGH THEM...
EXT. STREET -- EVENING

The sun is nearly down. A shaken Wren and Hallie regroup down
the block.

WREN
Did you see that? She looked right
through us! Like we weren’t
there...
Hallie did see. Tries to make sense of it all...
WREN (CONT'D)
She saw him! In the woods. I knew
it...
SUDDENLY, HALLIE'S PHONE RINGS.

They both stop in their tracks.
Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 87.
HALLIE
It's Chloe.
Hallie shows Wren the phone.
We see the name. The accompanying photo. A tiny selfie of
Chloe. The way they remember her, smiling up at them from the
screen.

Hallie answers. Puts it on speaker.

HALLIE (CONT'D)
Hello.

But there’s only silence.
HALLIE (CONT'D)
(into phone)
Hello? Chloe?

We hear shuffling on the other end of the line. Then a faint
murmur. Something that sounds like crying. A soft whimper.

CHLOE (V.O.)
Now I know...

HALLIE
Chloe? What is it?

CHLOE (V.O.)
It’s happening all the time...He
won’t go away...
The words come fast. Wren interrupts.

WREN
Chloe? Who?

No response.

WREN (CONT'D)
Chloe, are you there?

Chloe mumbles again. As the girls strain to hear..

CHLOE (V.O.)
He won’t stop...

WREN
What does he want?

(beat)
Chloe...Chloe are you there?

Silence. Then we hear Chloe crying.
Blue Rev. (06/09/16)
CHLOE (V.O.)
Don't ever call me again.
CALL ENDED. She hangs up.
Wren and Hallie look at each other.

HALLIE
What the hell was that?

They look in the direction of Chloe's house.

88.

The sky burns orange above the dark suburban street. A street

light flicks on. Darkness will be here soon.
Hallie makes a decision. Walks away.

HALLIE (CONT'D)
I don't want to do this anymore.

WREN
I don't either! But I'm stuck in
it. You're stuck in it, too. You
just don't know it yet.

HALLIE
What am I stuck in?

WREN
What we started. Hello?

Hallie crosses her arms.

WREN (CONT'D)
Don't look at me like that. I'm not
doing a "thing."

HALLIE
All right...

WREN
And don't say "All right” like that
to me. This is real Goddamnit!

HALLIE

Nope. I’m done. No more games.
WREN

It’s not a game. Don’t you get it?

(beat)
We only saw the website video. But
Chloe... She saw HIM in the woods!
Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 89.

HALLIE
(uncertain)
She said...
WREN

She said what exactly?
Hallie’s truly reached her limit.

HALLIE
I'm not going to let you keep
dragging me into this craziness.

WREN
You think I created this situation?

HALLIE
I think you love the drama...

WREN
Read the book I showed you. You’1ll
see the body count. Thousands of
disappearances. Search parties...
Faces on milk cartons... I’m not
making this shit up. It all
happened EXACTLY like AlleyKat
said...

HALLIE
AlleyKat93, of course. The expert
who knows everything. Funny you
didn't talk about this body count
stuff before.

Wren stammers a bit, thrown off balance by that...

WREN
It was all hearsay then. Just talk.
But now it’s not just her saying
it. It’s right there in black and
white. And Alleykat knows first
hand...

HALLIE
Yeah. And she’s probably some 50-
year-old horny dude living in
someone's basement, getting off on
emailing back and forth with
teenage girls...Ya ever think of
that? Did you?

And with that, Hallie turns her back to leave.

Wren gets really angry now.
68

Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 90.

WREN
You think you can just go back to
real life?!

HALLIE
(tosses back)
Yeah. I do. In fact, I have a “real
life” date with “real life” Tom
tonight. In real life...

Wren takes this like a gunshot. And Hallie escalates the
insult by continuing to walk away...

Wren shouts after her-
WREN
You heard what Chloe said! He’s not
going to stop! And going on a date
with Abercrombie Tom can’t change
that!

Hallie almost turns around. But instead throws her arm up in
the air. Flips Wren off.

WREN (CONT'D)
You know I’m right!!

But Hallie just walks away...

INT. HALLIE'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 68
Hallie makes final adjustments in the mirror. Tries to forget
about her tiff with Wren. Determined that all is, and will
be, normal.

INT. HALLIE’S HOUSE - DINING ROOM -- NIGHT 69

Hallie heads out. Past the dining room where her parents and
Lizzie eat.

HALLIE’S MOTHER
Not joining us for dinner?

HALLIE
Can’t. Got plans.

Hallie resumes her exit. But-

HALLIE’S FATHER
Hold on a second...
70

71

Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 91.

Hallie can hear it in her father’s tone. He’s not happy. She
turns back.

HALLIE’S FATHER (CONT’D)
Coach Sanders called. Said you
walked out on practice today. And
missed one last week. What’s going
on?

Busted. But Hallie’s emotional right now and going on this
date if it kills her.

HALLIE
I gotta go.

HALLIE’S MOTHER
Honey... We’re just asking--

But Hallie’s out the door. So confused and agitated by all
that’s happening.

EXT. TOM'S HOUSE -- NIGHT 70

Checking her makeup, Hallie knocks on the front door. Tom
opens it moments later. Happy to see her.

TOM
Hey.

HALLIE
Sorry I’m late...

TOM
No. Come in.

INT. TOM'S HOUSE - ENTRYWAY -- CONTINUOUS 71

Hallie flashes an anxious smile and follows Tom in. She
avoids eye contact trying to keep the excitement at bay.

HALLIE
I thought I had the wrong house.
There aren't any cars in the
driveway.

TOM
Yeah, my dad's on a business thing.
And my mom went someplace with some
friends of hers.

HALLIE
Nobody's home?
72

Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 92.

She hesitates just long enough to show it makes her nervous.

TOM
Just us. That okay?
HALLIE
Sure.
INT. TOM'S LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT 72

Hallie checks out Tom’s collection of comic books, Fan Boy
figurines, and Sci Fi movie paraphernalia.

HALLIE
(smiling)
I didn’t know you were a nerd...

TOM
Yeah... I wasn’t always this
handsome.

Hallie laughs. They sit on a comfy couch. An old turntable
spins a vinyl record around and around. A simple vocal over a
soulful rhythm fills the air.

Hallie casts sidelong glances at Tom, who seems to really be
into the song.

TOM (CONT'D)
Listen to that sound...

Hallie nods, pretending she gets it. Her eyes wander around
the room. She focuses on the impressive collection of vinyl
records stacked on shelves.

HALLIE
That’s a lot of records.

TOM
Yeah, most of them are my dad's,
but the newer stuff is mine...

He gestures to the current song.

HALLIE
Cool.

TOM
You want me to put something else
on?

HALLIE

No, this is great.
Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 93.

Then a pause in the conversation. An opportunity...

Tom finally makes his move and kisses her. Hallie falls back
into the couch, running her fingers through his hair. Tom
starts to round the bases, hands exploring.

And for a moment, Hallie doesn’t resist. But then pushes him
back, slowing it down. Taking control.

TOM
You okay?

She nods and a big smile appears on her face. They slowly
ease back on the sofa as the music continues in the
background. Then just as Hallie closes her eyes and lets
herself go...

A HIGH PITCHED SOUND!

Hallie turns to look at the speakers.

HALLIE
Do you hear that?

TOM
Good. Right?

Tom doesn’t seem to notice. Hallie scans the room, ears wide
open. Listening. But the music returns to normal.

TOM (CONT'D)
Come here...

He pulls Hallie closer. But just as she turns back...

TOM'S FACE HAS CHANGED!! IT’S NOW JUST A VAGUE SUGGESTION OF
SOMETHING HUMAN, DISAPPEARING INTO A BLANK VISAGE.

HALLIE SHRIEKS AND PUSHES AWAY!

Tom disappears as the room seems to warp and expand
impossibly around her. The music devolves into the same high
pitched noise we’ve heard before. Screaming from the
speakers. Louder and louder as the room transforms. And in
the chaos...

HALLIE SCREAMS!!!

Then instantly...WE GO BACK TO REALITY.

Tom jumps off Hallie like he's been electrocuted. Hallie
bolts upright.
73

Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 94.
TOM (CONT'D)
What the hell?

Hallie’s eyes dart around the room. Checking all four
corners. But everything has returned to normal.

Except Tom is now looking at her like she’s a complete
lunatic.

TOM (CONT'D)
I didn't do anything.
HALLIE
(still confused)
What?

TOM
I didn't do anything!

HALLIE
(mortified)
I know.
Tom relaxes. She catches her breath.

TOM
Are you okay?

Hallie looks at him. Long story...

LATER 73

Tom comes back in the room with a glass of water. Hands it to
Hallie. Takes a look at her phone.

TOM
Have you told anybody about this?

She shakes her head.

TOM (CONT'D)
If Katie was on a weird Slender Man
site, who knows who she met there?
Probably some guy with a van. I
hate to say it...

He starts tapping on her phone, searching for something.
TOM (CONT'D)
(beat)
Is this it?

Hallie looks up and sees what he's doing.
Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 95.

HALLIE
Don't!

That “How to Summon Slender Man” video starts to play.

TOM
I've never seen this one...

HALLIE
Tom, don't!

He looks at her, startled. She jumps up, grabs for her phone.
He reflexively holds it out at arm's length.

HALLIE (CONT'D)
You can't watch it. Promise me you
won't watch it. Ever.

TOM
It’s just a video--

HALLIE
(interrupting)
No. Really. YOU HAVE TO PROMISE ME!
TOM
(starts to laugh)
Okay, I won't...

HALLIE
I’m not kidding. Promise me.

Tom is dubious but can see she’s serious. He gives Hallie
back her phone.

TOM
Okay. I promise...

Hallie looks at him, anxiety dancing in her eyes. He pulls
her close. Tries to give comfort.

TOM (CONT'D)
Really.

Finally, she nods thinking he just might mean it.

HALLIE
Okay, well... I should probably go.

One last kiss and Tom walks her to the front door.
76

77

Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 96.

INT. HALLIE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 76

Hallie bursts in and drops her things on the bed. Half of it
scatters onto the floor.

She takes a deep breath trying to calm. In the bedroom mirror
Hallie sees the desperation in her eyes. The fear on her
face. She’s almost unrecognizable to herself.

Finally she breaks. Sobbing. She turns away so she can’t see
the tears and lets it all go.

INT. SCHOOL - LOCKER AREA -- DAY 77

Hallie drifts unnoticed through a seemingly endless crowd of
students. Emotionless. Completely torn down. Until she turns
the corner and sees...

CHLOE!

Chloe carries books like any other student, but something’s
different. Her skin so pale. Except for the make-up caked on
her face. Like a corpse prepared for an open casket funeral.

HALLIE
Chloe...

She passes, without acknowledging Hallie's presence. Hallie
turns to go after her.

HALLIE (CONT'D)
Chloe! Wait! What's going on?

Chloe stops. Turns to Hallie with a crazed and paranoid look
on her face.

HALLIE (CONT'D)
Something happened... To you. And
Katie, I guess. Something's going
to happen to me. And Wren, too.
Isn't it?

No response.

HALLIE (CONT'D)
Is it already happening? I've seen
things? I can’t explain it...

A thin smile creeps across Chloe’s face. She breaks into a
strange laugh. We see the confusion on Hallie’s face as she
watches Chloe drift into a crowded hallway.
78

Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 97.

INT. SCHOOL - CLASSROOM -- DAY 78
An EYE stares up at us from a metal tray. A COW’S EYE.

Biology class. STUDENTS are lined up at different tables with
cow eyes in front of them. SCALPELS AND SCISSORS in hand.

Hallie sees Wren. Who looks the other way. Then sees Chloe
two tables over silently staring out the window. The scalpel
hanging from her hand.

BIOLOGY TEACHER
Hey, look who decided to show up!

We see Tom duck into the room. Distracted and out of breath,
like he was being chased.

Hallie smiles as he comes closer. But he just slips past,
taking the open stool at the end of her table.

Wren scowls...

BIOLOGY TEACHER (CONT’D)
All right, first, take a moment to
observe the external anatomy...

Hallie leans back to draw Tom’s attention. He still seems to
not acknowledge she's there. She whispers-

HALLIE
Hey.

He doesn't respond. Hallie faces forward as the teacher walks
by.

BIOLOGY TEACHER
The cornea looks cloudy and bluish
because of the preservation
process...

Hallie looks at the cloudy, bluish eye then back to Tom.
BIOLOGY TEACHER (CONT’D)
Now slice as evenly as you can
through the sclera to separate the
anterior features of the eye...

Around Hallie, students are cutting now. Including Chloe. She
speaks louder this time-

HALLIE
Tom!

He looks. Seems to notice her for the first time.
Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 98.
HALLIE (CONT'D)
Are you okay?
It takes him half a beat but he smiles.

TOM
Yeah, I’m fine.

Hallie nods but can see Tom’s smile is short-lived. He looks
harried. Hallie’s about to say something else to him but is
interrupted by a...

LOUD GASP!

Hallie turns to see kids backing away from one of the tables.
Chloe’s table. We see confusion on Hallie’s face.

Chloe just stands there, alone at the table. Oblivious to the
other kids backing away. The commotion spreads like a wave
through the classroom.

Then Hallie sees...

Chloe cutting herself! Drawing the point of her scalpel
across her palm as if testing its sharpness! Blood pours onto
the table. And then...

CHLOE HOLDS THE SCALPEL UP TO HER EYE!

We hear chairs scooting. Kids jumping to their feet. Hallie’s
eyes widen, frozen in the moment.

Chloe studies the blade for a long beat, a sinister smile on
her face. And then...

SHE STABS!!

As we cut away there are SCREAMS!!!

Hallie and Wren just stands there. Watching. Paralyzed with
terror as the Teacher grabs for Chloe. Desperately trying to

pry the scalpel out of her hands...

STUDENT #1
OH MY GOD!

We watch as the class erupts into chaos! Students rushing out
of the room screaming.

STUDENT #2
HER EYES!!
79

80

Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 99.

EXT. SCHOOL - PARKING LOT -- DAY 79
PARAMEDICS wheel Chloe to an ambulance.

With tears streaming down, Hallie and Wren watch Chloe
disappear behind the ambulance doors.

For a moment, Tom stands behind them. We see the fear on his
face. Then he slowly slips away behind the gathering crowd.

Wren and Hallie lock eyes. The nightmare is only getting
worse...

WREN
I told you...
(crying hysterically)

I told you and you wouldn’t believe

me.
Hallie just stands there, shaking. Tears pour from her eyes
as the ambulance’s lights and siren slowly fade away.
INT. HALLIE'S HOUSE - HALLWAY -- EVENING 80

Hallie races upstairs. Her Mother in hot pursuit.

HALLIE'S MOTHER
Hallie, are you all right?

HALLIE
Yeah, Mom.

HALLIE'S MOTHER
Lizzie told us about Chloe...

Hallie stops.
HALLIE'S MOTHER (CONT'D)
I can't believe it. You were there?
Did you see her do it?

Hallie can’t speak. She can’t find the words.

HALLIE'S MOTHER (CONT’D)
Oh my God. That poor girl.

Hallie’s mother doesn’t know the half of it.

HALLIE
I need to lie down...

She trails off. Her Mother nods.
81

82

Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 100.
HALLIE'S MOTHER
Of course. I’m so sorry.
She gives Hallie a hug. Senses something...

HALLIE’S MOTHER
Are you okay?

Hallie nods.
HALLIE’S MOTHER (CONT’D)
Because your sister’s taking it
very hard. I’m worried about her.
She hasn’t come out of her room
since she got home...

HALLIE
I'm just tired.

HALLIE’S MOTHER
Can I get you anything?

Hallie shakes her head and keeps going.

INT. HALLIE’S BEDROOM -- LATER 81

Hallie’s computer sits in her lap. That ominous Slender Man
website up on the screen.

She types a message in the chat window.
TO ALLEYKAT93: “You have to help us!”
The cursor blinks. No response.

She tries again: “How do you make him go away?” She presses
send. Adds: "PLEASE!!!"

But gets an automatic response: “USER ACCOUNT DISCONTINUED.”

On Hallie. We see hope fade and the fear return...

LATER 82
Hallie lies in bed. Eyes fixed on a framed photo that sits on
her bedside table: Herself, Wren, Katie and Chloe in a goofy
selfie from happier times.

She looks at the picture as if it were a distant memory.
Then...

SPORADIC SOBS OUT IN THE HALL. HER PARENTS WHISPERING.
83

Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 101.

Hallie sits up-

HALLIE'S FATHER (0.S.)
Come on. Just breathe, Lizzie.

INT. HALLIE’S HOUSE - HALLWAY/BATHROOM -- CONTINUOUS 83

Hallie moves through the dark hallway, towards a light in the
bathroom. We hear Lizzie crying. Her parents urgent voices.
Hallie’s almost running now.

She reaches the half-open door and sees her Father tending to
Lizzie. Lizzie’s struggling to breathe. Hallie's Mother
stands by feeling helpless.

HALLIE
What's going on?

HALLIE'S MOTHER
She can’t breathe. We have to get
her to the emergency room.

Lizzie gulps for air.

HALLIE
Lizzie? Oh my God...

Lizzie looks up with swollen red eyes. Tears streak down the
pale skin on her face. Her hands tremble.

HALLIE’S FATHER
The ambulance is on its way...

Hallie's Father starts bundling Lizzie in a towel. Hallie
watches helplessly as he carries Lizzie past her.

HALLIE’S MOTHER
It’s okay, baby...

Lizzie begins to lose consciousness, her eyes rolling back in
her head!

Hallie rushes over.

HALLIE
Lizzie! Wake up!!

HALLIE'S FATHER
We’re all here, Lizzie.

HALLIE'S MOTHER
Where’s that ambulance?!
84

87

Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 102.

Finally, we hear SIRENS in the distance.

INT. LIZZIE’'S HOSPITAL ROOM -- NIGHT 84

Lizzie’s bed sits in a pool of harsh light. Pale skin and
dark eyes. The vital signs monitor tracks her pulse.

Hallie sits bedside listening to her Mother cry as the doctor
tells them Lizzie had a MASSIVE ANXIETY ATTACK.

Hallie’s father steps over shielding Hallie from the details.
HALLIE’S FATHER
Hallie, give us a minute. Why don’t
you go get your Mother something to
drink...?
Hallie’s father hands her some money and motions to the door.

CUT TO:

INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY -- DAY

Hallie taps away on her phone as she walks towards a vending
machine at the end of the hallway. She sends a text to Tom.

ON THE PHONE: “YOU AROUND?”

Hallie comes to the end of the hallway.

No answer...

She punches a button on the vending machine, a lost look in
her eyes as the soda tumbles out. She grabs it and turns to

walk away. But as she does...

Hallie sees an ORDERLY step out of a room down the hall.
Outside the room is a cluster of BALLOONS...

THE NAME “CHLOE” ON ONE OF THEM.

Hallie’s feet slow as she approaches the open doorway.
Slowly, she peeks inside.

POV - A curtain sections off the room.

INT. CHLOE’S HOSPITAL ROOM -- CONTINUOUS 87

The curtain slides back. Hallie enters to see “Get well”
cards and flowers.
Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 103.

BUT THE BED IS EMPTY.

RASPY VOICE (0.S.)
Hallie?

Hallie startles! For a moment she can’t locate her, but finds
Chloe sitting by the window in a wheelchair. Her eyes are
bandaged with thick pads of gauze.

HALLIE
Chloe. Oh my God. How’d you know it
was-—-

CHLOE

I can smell your perfume...

Hallie doesn’t see the sinister grin creeping across Chloe's
face as she moves closer.

HALLIE
Are you okay?

A tiny laugh escapes Chloe’s throat. A hideous, dry rasp.
CHLOE
(grins morbidly)
I tried to stop it. But it didn't
work...

Chloe reaches up and picks at one of the bandages.

HALLIE
No. Don't do that!

Hallie tries to stop her hands, but Chloe pushes her away.

CHLOE
I realize now. He’1ll never stop.

CHLOE RIPS THE GAUZE FROM HER FACE!
The bandages fall away and we see...
HER MISSING EYES ARE NOW DEEP CRIMSON XS OF SCARRED TISSUE.

CHLOE (CONT'D)
But I can still see!

CHLOE STARTS TO SCREAM!

CHLOE (CONT'D)
I CAN STILL SEE!!!
88

Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 104.

The horrific stare turns Hallie for the door and the screams
chase her into the hallway.
INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY -- CONTINUOUS 88

Hallie rushes away. Past the nurse’s station. Back to
Lizzie's room...

Her parents are gone. No doctors and nurses. We see distress
on Hallie's face and then...

SHE GASPS.
LIZZIE’S BODY IS COVERED IN A WHITE SHEET!

The hum from the lights fill our ears as Hallie slowly paces
over to the bed.

Hallie reaches towards the rigid body. Hands trembling.
Slowly, she pulls back the white sheet and reveals a face...

LIZZIE LIES MOTIONLESS. EYES CLOSED. SKIN DRAINED OF COLOR.

HALLIE
No...

Hallie gently touches her hand to Lizzie’s face.

HALLIE (CONT'D)
Lizzie...come on...wake up...

Her voice falters. She shakes her sister.

HALLIE (CONT'D)
Lizzie...

But it does nothing. Hallie starts to cry. Tears flowing.
Dripping from her eyes.

HALLIE (CONT'D)
No...

Then we see a single tear come from Lizzie’s eye. Hallie
wipes the tear.

Then Lizzie’s face twitches!

A microscopic movement. A tiny muscle contraction under one
of Lizzie’s eyes.

Hallie see it and a burst of hope appears on her face.
92

Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 105.
HALLIE (CONT'D)
Lizzie!
LIZZIE’S FACE TWITCHES AGAIN.

HALLIE (CONT'D)
Wake up!

Lizzie’s eyes still don’t open, but the muscles begin to
twitch all over now. Contorting Lizzie’s face. Strange
expressions of unknown emotions.

Hallie shakes her again.

AND LIZZIE’S HEAD FALLS TO THE SIDE. HER MOUTH HANGING OPEN.
Like she’s going to say something!

Hallie stares at her, waiting for the words. Lizzie’s lips
begin to move and we see...

A GIANT BUG CRAWL OUT OF HER MOUTH. Hallie jumps back and
screams!

THEN ANOTHER BUG EMERGES... AND ANOTHER...Lizzie’s face
bubbles under the skin. Rippling like water. Expanding and
contracting until...

HER EYELIDS OPEN. BUT THERE ARE NO EYES. ONLY BUGS!

They burrow out from under the skin on Lizzie’s face. We hear
them scurrying and gnawing their way through. Hundreds
crawling out of the flesh.

HALLIE BACKS AWAY HORRIFIED! Turns to run...

ONLY TO SEE HER PARENTS COME IN. AND THE ROOM AROUND HER 92
RETURN TO NORMAL.

HALLIE'S MOTHER
Hallie? You okay?

Hallie tries to comprehend. Looks over and sees Lizzie
sleeping in bed. Struggling but still with us.

Emotion overwhelms Hallie. She can’t keep it in anymore.
Her Mother and Father look at each other, confused.
HALLIE’S FATHER

Hallie, we're worried about you.
You haven’t been yourself lately.
94

95

96

Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 106.
She looks into her parents’ eyes. They’1l never believe her
if she told them.

Hallie bursts into tears.

EXT. SCHOOL - LOCKER AREA -- DAY 94

A crowded hallway. Kids make their way to class like it was
any other day. Moving on, like nothing has happened.

Hallie walks with her head down. Trying not to see anything.
Or anyone. Fearful of more visions.
INT. SCHOOL - CLASSROOM -- DAY 95

Hallie enters, distant and distracted. Her Biology Teacher
welcomes everyone back. With a heavy heart.

Hallie sees Wren. An emotional, loaded beat. Then notices...
Tom is absent.

We can see the anxiety flickering inside. She grabs her phone
and texts him...

Hallie: Where are you?

She stares at the screen. No message back. Hallie is about to
message him again when...

A WAVE OF CONFUSION RUSHES THROUGH THE CLASSROOM!

Hallie and Wren look up to see kids out of their seats. At
the windows. Whispering. Pointing...

With tentative steps, the girls cross over to the windows.
It’s almost like they know what they’re about to see...
EXT. SCHOOL - BELL TOWER -- CONTINUOUS 96

TOM STANDS ON THE LEDGE OF THE BELL TOWER! High above the
ground...

Leaning out, eyes locked on the ground below. Like he’s going
to jump!

HALLIE
Shit!
97

98

Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 107.

INT. CLASSROOM -- CONTINUOUS 97
Wren and her classmates just stand there, shocked and

confused. Staring out the windows. Hallie charges past.
Rushes out of the room.

EXT. SCHOOL - BELL TOWER -- CONTINUOUS 98
A crowd of STUDENTS, TEACHERS, and SECURITY have gathered
below the tower. Looking up at Tom. Calling 911. Begging him
to come down. Begging him not to jump...
Hallie comes running.
HALLIE
(yells up to him)
TOM!!!
Tom spots Hallie fighting her way through the crowd.

HALLIE (CONT'D)
Tom... WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

TOM
(yells down)
YOU WERE RIGHT, HALLIE!

The crowd's attention quickly shifts to Hallie. Collectively
waiting for an answer. Right about what?

HALLIE
TOM! COME DOWN! RIGHT NOW!!

And that’s when Tom makes it clear...

TOM
BUT I SEE HIM! EVERYWHERE! !

Shit! He watched the video...
We hear SIRENS. EMERGENCY RESPONDERS on the way.
TOM’S POV: In the distance, at the edge of the woods stands a
blurred figure. Tall and slender. Arms outstretched like the
branches of a tree. Beckoning...
HALLIE (0.S.)
IT’S OKAY! COME DOWN! TOM, PLEASE!
STOP THIS!!!

BACK ON TOM: A realization appears on his face. An unnatural
look of joy...
Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 108.
TOM
I'M GOING TO!!

HE STEPS OVER THE EDGE AND FREE FALLS!

FRIGHTENED VOICES CRY OUT FROM THE CROWD!

AS TOM’S BODY CRASHES TO THE GROUND!!!

AND HALLIE SCREAMS!! A study in shock and terror. Tears

streaming down her face. Frozen in this nightmare...

INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY -- DAY

Hallie wanders aimlessly like a lost child. Walking down a
hallway that feels like it stretches out forever.

A round of laughter draws her attention to one of the rooms.
Inside the room, a family jokes around, cheering up a little
girl in a hospital bed. All smiles as a nurse prepares the
tiny patient for release.

But the smiles bring sadness to Hallie’s eyes. She starts to
cry, the weight of everything crumbling around her.

We can see the pain in Hallie’s eyes as we follow her around
the corner.

Then we hear SHRIEKS from down the hallway.
Hallie sees nurses hurrying towards a hospital room.
RUSHING INTO LIZZIE’S ROOM!

Hallie moves quicker now. Almost running as she reaches the
door. Inside the room...

IT IS LIZZIE SHRIEKING. OUT OF CONTROL.

Hallie’s Mother and Father look up as Hallie steps into the
room. We see the panic in their eyes. The tears.

INT. LIZZIE’S HOSPITAL ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

A DOCTOR stands over Lizzie reading her vital signs. He barks
orders at the NURSES who respond immediately. Efficient like

a machine. Working in unison.

NURSE
BP, 80 over 40.
Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 109.
DOCTOR
Let's get her moving.

The railing slides up on the sides of Lizzie’s bed. The
wheels release. An IV is attached to a hanger.

And suddenly, Lizzie is being wheeled towards the door.

HALLIE
Where are they taking her?

She rushes over, grabbing Lizzie’s bed. Hallie’s Father stops
her, letting the nurses pass.

HALLIE’S FATHER
Hallie, they’ve got to get her to
the ICU...
MORE SCREAMS from Lizzie. Her face paler than before.

HALLIE
Lizzie!

Hallie pulls away from her father and grabs Lizzie’s hand.
Lizzie sees Hallie.

LIZZIE
(hisses)
He didn’t have a face!
TERROR WASHES OVER HALLIE WHEN SHE HEARS THE WORDS...

And then Lizzie’s hand is ripped away. The hospital bed
rolling towards the door.

HALLIE
Lizzie!

As they exit the room.

HALLIE (CONT'D)
Lizzie!!

Hallie’s Father wraps his arms around her as they watch
Lizzie disappear.

Tears fall from Hallie’s face as the fear builds inside. We
see it growing in her eyes. Overwhelming her. And then it’s
too much...

Hallie breaks. Bursting into tears. Fearing the worst. She
pulls away from her father. Heads for the door...

SMASH CUT TO:

Tan Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 110.

EXT. HALLIE’S HOUSE - LIZZIE’S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 99
Hallie charges through the door, searching.
LIZZIE’S LAPTOP SITS ON THE DESK IN THE CORNER.

Hallie rushes over and taps on the keyboard. The screen
lights up and we see...

THAT OMINOUS RED-ON-BLACK WEBSITE!
A wave of dread washes over her as the realization sinks in.

- ON THE SCREEN: We see Lizzie’s conversations with other
users. As we scroll through, a name catches Hallie’s eye...

“WREN”
HALLIE OPENS THE THREAD.

IN THE FEED: Questions from Lizzie. Answers from Wren. Who is
Slender Man? What does he do? How does he find you?

Hallie scrolls down to the last entry...

THERE’S A VIDEO LINK!! Hallie clicks and it loads...

- IN THE VIDEO: The camera moves through the trees. We hear a
SWEET LAUGH from behind the camera. Barely audible. Then a
girl appears, walking away from us. We follow her into a
clearing. She stops and faces the camera.

Hallie freezes, horrified when she realizes...IT’S LIZZIE!!

- We hear Lizzie giggle.

THEN HALLIE SEES IT!!

-— SOMEONE HANDS THE CAMERA TO LIZZIE. WE CAN NOW SEE
PERFECTLY. BUT LIZZIE DOESN’T FOCUS IT ON HERSELF...

- IT’S WREN!! STANDING THERE! ! IN THE WOODS WITH LIZZIE!!!

 

LIZZIE (0.C.)
Now what do I do?

- Wren looks into the camera.

WREN
Just sacrifice something you love.

- The video ends.

Hallie stares at the dead black screen. Horror on her face.

WREN (0.S.) (CONT'D)
I'm sorry...
Hallie jumps, the unexpected voice spinning her around.

Wren stands in the doorway, afraid to enter the room. Tears
stream down from the dark circles under her eyes.

HALLIE
How could you do that?

WREN
It was before I knew what would
happen...
Wren’s voice breaks, the tears fight against the words.

HALLIE’S HORROR QUICKLY TURNS TO ANGER.

HALLIE
Wren, she’s in the hospital!!

WREN
I didn’t know, I swear. But I
think I found a way-
Hallie steps to Wren. Full of rage. About to hit her...
WREN (CONT'D)
(yells)
I came over here because I found
something that might stop this!!
Hallie stops herself. Just barely.

WREN (CONT'D)
See for yourself!

Wren scrambles to the computer. Hallie just stares at her,
unconvinced. Suspicious.

WREN (CONT'D)
I went through my conversations
with AlleyKat...

Wren scrolls to AlleyKat’s last entry. Just random numbers.

ON THE SCREEN: “32.903852, -79.988029”

WREN (CONT'D)
And then look...

She clicks on another feed. And another. And another. Hallie
watches Wren frantically navigate the site.

HALLIE
You've lost your mind.

WREN
No!! It’s these numbers...

ON THE SCREEN: We click through a series of conversations.
People asking for help. “How do you stop Slender Man!!?” And
the last entry of each feed... “%32.903852, -79.988029”

The anger slowly melts away as Hallie sees each new feed.

WREN (CONT'D)
Then I saw this.

ON THE SCREEN: Wren opens a feed from Katie to AlleyKat.
Desperately, pleading for help. And AlleyKat’s final entry...

%32.903852, -79.988029”
Wren looks back at Hallie.

WREN (CONT'D)
So I searched it...

ON THE SCREEN: Wren searches the random set of numbers in a
web browser. A MAP POPS UP!! A spot in the middle of nowhere.

WREN (CONT'D)
They aren’t random numbers. They’re
coordinates...

ON THE SCREEN: Wren zooms all the way in on the map. It
zeroes in on a spot in the middle of nowhere. In the woods.

- A TAGGED LOCATION APPEARS ON THE MAP...
“SLENDER MAN’S MANSION”

- IT’S JUST A DISTORTED ARRAY OF PIXELS. TREES CLUSTER AROUND
WHAT LOOKS LIKE A STRUCTURE. BUT IT’S IMPOSSIBLE TO TELL...

WREN (CONT'D)
We need to go there.

HALLIE
Come on. Someone hacked in and put
that there. It’s a joke...

WREN
What if it’s not? What if there’s a
way to save Lizzie. To save all of
us. Maybe even Katie. We can take
my mom’s car.

HALLIE
You wanna go!? Are you crazy!?

WREN
What choice do we have!!?

Hallie just stares at the screen. We see something surface in
her eyes. A sliver of hope.

INT. CAR -- NIGHT

The city lights are left behind as they speed down an empty
highway. A darkening landscape rolls by as they descend into
a sleepy rural area.

Wren glances at Hallie. Treading lightly. Tension in air.

Hallie doesn’t make eye contact. The anger is still there.

EXT. BACK ROAD -- NIGHT

Headlights cut through the darkness. A RED SEDAN makes its
way down the crumbling country road. The car rolls to a stop
at a DEAD END. The engine dies and the headlights disappear.

All we hear is the silence of the forest.

INT. CAR -- NIGHT

The girls focus on Wren’s phone. A destination is mapped out
on the screen. It straight ahead. Past the dead end.

EXT. BACK ROAD -- NIGHT

The car doors creak open. The girls step out and walk around
to the front of the car.

WREN
It’s through there...

Their gaze drifts to the darkness ahead as the wind swells in
the trees. Leaves rustle on the swaying branches.

HALLIE
Okay...

They both flashlight their phones. But as soon as they
spotlight the treeline...

THEY SEE A GIRL WALKING INTO THE WOODS.
Tan Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 114.

The girl holds for a moment. Standing in bare feet and a
long, white nightgown. But just as quickly, the girl slips
into darkness. Hard to tell, but it looked like Katie!

HALLIE (CONT'D)
Was that...?

WREN
(calling out)
Hey!!
EXT. FOREST -- NIGHT
THE TWO BEAMS OF LIGHT SPOT THE WAY THROUGH THE DARKNESS.
Wren and Hallie chase through the trees, branches snagging
and grabbing at their clothes. They stop and aim their
flashlights, but the girl is gone.

WREN
Goddamnit. Where is she?

THEN MOVEMENT UP AHEAD. THE GIRL APPEARS IN THE DISTANCE.

WREN (CONT'D)
Hey, wait!

Wren’s voice echoes through the forest as they chase after
her. Their flashlights sweep through the darkness.

WREN (CONT'D)
Come back!!

The light from their phones leads them to a dark path in the
forest. The path widens towards something hidden in darkness.

A GIANT GNARLED OAK TREE.

Hallie and Wren walk towards the tree, searching. As they
move closer, something materializes under its branches.

A HUGE, BROKEN DOWN MANSION!

Was it hidden in darkness? Or did it appear out of thin air?
The towering structure blends into the forest around it.
Overgrown. Abandoned. And perched on a crumbling pedestal of
rock in front of it...

A LARGE CAST IRON BELL.

Wren and Katie slowly approach the decaying structure. A
heavy blanket of silence surrounds them.
Tan Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 115.

SUDDENLY, THEY SEE THE GIRL SLIP INSIDE THE FRONT DOOR.

She beckons them to follow and disappears.

IT LOOKED LIKE KATIE!

Wren and Hallie call out, running after. They’re right behind
her, scrambling up the steps.

INT. MANSION -- NIGHT

The door creaks open in the darkness. Hallie and Wren step
inside, their phones lighting the way.

WREN
Katie...

Her voice bounces of the walls and fades away. No response.
Only the floorboards creaking under the girls’ feet.

THEN A TINY LAUGH SHATTERS THE SILENCE.
They spotlight the center of a large open room...
AND THE GIRL IS STANDING THERE. FACING AWAY FROM US.

HALLIE
Katie? Is that you?

The girl slowly turns around. She looks up at them, dark
circles around her eyes...

IT’S KATIE!!
The girls rush towards her.

GIRLS
Katie!!

The lights from their phones splash off the walls, light
bouncing around the room.

HALLIE
Are you okay?

But Katie doesn’t speak.
WREN
(to Katie)

C'mon. Let’s go...

Wren grabs Katie’s hand, but she violently pulls away.
Tan Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 116.
HALLIE
Katie, what are you doing? C’mon!
Still, she doesn’t move. It’s like she doesn’t even see them.
AND THEN KATIE SPEAKS!

KATIE
We live here now...

Katie looks to the ceiling high above their heads.

KATIE (CONT'D)
With Him... Here in the Absence...

Katie looks directly at them.

KATIE (CONT'D)
IN THE NOTHING...

AND AT THAT EXACT SAME MOMENT, THE GIRLS’ PHONES DIE.
The flashlights disappear and the room goes dark.

HALLIE
Katie, please!!

WREN
Let’s go, goddamnit!!

The girls grabs Katie’s hands, but she won’t move. It’s like
she’s carved in stone. Her body stiff and rigid.

THEN A HAUNTING SOUND FILLS THEIR EARS.

A BELL, ECHOES OUTSIDE. IT FILTERS THROUGH THE WALLS.

 

The girls freeze. A shiver rolls down their spines.

SUDDENLY, KATIE ARCHES BACKWARDS AND A SOUND COMES OUT OF HER
LUNGS! A RUSH OF AIR BURSTS FROM HER MOUTH AND HER BODY LIFTS
OFF THE FLOOR!! LEVITATING!! DRIFTING UPWARDS!!!

Wren and Hallie can’t speak. They can’t move, frozen as they
watch Katie lift into the air.

THEN THOUSANDS OF TINY WHISPERS FILTER OUT OF THE WALLS. THE
VOICES OF LOST CHILDREN SWIRLING AND CRYING FOR HELP! !

Wren and Hallie spin around, but there’s nobody there. Only
Katie hovering in mid air, drifting towards the ceiling.

KATIE
HE’S HERE...

 %
108

Tan Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 117.
AS SOON AS SHE SPEAKS THE WORDS, DARK TENTACLES CRAWL DOWN
THE WALLS LIKE BLACK VEINS SPIDER-WEBBING IN ALL DIRECTIONS!!
Hallie and Wren’s eyes follow the tentacles up to...
AN INKY BLACK TORSO MELTING OUT OF THE CEILING.
Hallie and Wren stand frozen, entranced by the terrible
figure. Long thin arms forming. Reaching towards Katie as she
floats upwards. Her body warps and deforms...
AND SHE IS ABSORBED BY THE FIGURE DROPPING DOWN FROM ABOVE!!!
Then a face evolves...

STARING AT THEM WITHOUT EYES. A BLANK EMPTY VOID.

Wren starts to bolt for the door, but Hallie just stands
there. Wren grabs her and spins her around.

WREN
Hallie!! Run!!!
EXT. MANSION -- NIGHT
The front door slams open. Hallie bursts through the doorway.
Wren’s right behind her. As they race into the trees, Hallie

glances back...

POV - A TALL THIN FIGURE STEPS OUT OF THE HOUSE, TENTACLES
SLITHERING AROUND HIM. HIS BLANK FACE STARING.

Then Wren takes off!!

EXT. FOREST -- CONTINUOUS 108
Hallie dodges trees and branches racing after her.

HALLIE
Wren!!

Her feet carry her as fast as they can.
THEN WE HEAR SOMETHING BEHIND US!! Hallie looks back...

SOMETHING IS MOVING THROUGH THE TREES. A MASSIVE SHAPE.
SNAPPING BRANCHES BEHIND HER.

Hallie darts through the underbrush. Branches scraping across
her body. Scratching her arms and face.

Then out of nowhere, Hallie charges into a clearing.

*
Tan Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 118.

Hallie turns and sees Wren just as she emerges. They run to
each other, distancing themselves from the sound of branches
breaking. Trees snapping.

Up ahead, the moonlight sketches an outline of the horizon.
The girls see it through the trees.

SUDDENLY, THE WIND STOPS! AND THE WOODS AROUND THEM. THE
CRICKETS STOP CHIRPING. THE LEAVES STOP RUSTLING. DEAD QUIET!

The girls turn toward each other. Then like a whisper...

A LONG, FAINT CHIME RESONATES, CARRYING OUT FROM SOMEWHERE
DEEP IN THE DARKENED WOODS.

 

Hair stands on end as the girls recognize the noise.
NEXT THAT DEAFENING SILENCE...

It’s as if the world were frozen in time...the absence of
sound exploding in the girls’ ears.

AND THEN A DEEP, LOW TONE. AN UNSETTLING, HOLLOW RING.

WE HEAR THE FINAL BELL!!

THE GIRLS TURN TOWARDS THE SOUND AND SOMEHOW THEY ARE RIGHT
BACK AT SLENDER MAN’S MANSION! THE GIANT GNARLED AND TWISTED
OAK TREE TOWERS OVERHEAD.

Arms branching out and winding around each other. A MASSIVE
STATIC SHAPE. Or is there movement? Is it getting closer or
is the tree changing? Growing?

We see the terror on the girls faces as they stare at what
once looked like a sprawling, twisted oak tree.

But now really has changed...

Morphed into the TALL, SLENDER TORSO OF A MAN with impossibly
long arms extending towards us. The tree branches CRACK AND
SNAP LIKE TWIGS as more arms appear.

THE ARMS UNFOLDING LIKE PETALS OF A BLACK FLOWER. HOVERING IN
THE AIR AROUND HIM LIKE TENTACLES.

SLENDER MAN IS RIGHT THERE!!! HIS ARMS REACHING FOR THEM! !
CLOSER AND CLOSER!!!

The girls kick into gear and take off. But now see...

*
Tan Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 119.

Slender Man the same exact distance IN FRONT OF THEM!
The girls look right. THEY SEE HIM THERE, TOO!

WREN (CONT'D)
This way!

They turn, race towards nothing. Branches slashing at their
bodies as they charge through.

The girls look for cover. Find it behind a tree. Out of
breath. Lungs burning.

HALLIE
Do you see anything?
WREN
No...
HALLIE

C’mon, we gotta keep moving!
Hallie starts to go. But Wren stays put.

HALLIE (CONT'D)
Wren! Let’s go!

Wren turns to Hallie--

WREN
You go, Hallie...

A sudden calm’s come over her.

WREN (CONT'D)
I can buy you time.

Hallie looks at Wren in disbelief.
WREN (CONT'D)
I screwed up. I never should have
shown Lizzie. All of this has been
my fault.
THEN SOMETHING MOVES BEHIND THEM!

WREN (CONT'D)
Run Hallie! Goddamnit!! RUN!!!

SLENDER MAN IS RIGHT THERE! WRAPPING HIS ARMS AROUND WREN!
ENVELOPING HER! AND HALLIE IS NEXT!

*
Tan Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 120.

But somehow Hallie wrestles free and charges deeper into the
forest. Screaming at the top of her lungs. Too afraid to look
back. Running for her life. Until...

SMACK!

She crashes into a tree. Or is it him?

No time to look. She’s back on her feet. Running the
gauntlet. It feels like an eternity. Legs pushed to their
limit...

SMACK!

She crashes into another tree...

IT’S SLENDER MAN! TOWERING OVER HER!

Hallie tries to get back on her feet. Screams--

HALLIE
WHAT DO YOU WANT!!?

No response. Just that high pitched sound...

Hallie falls to the ground as a TENDRIL enters frame, like
some kind of grasping vine made of translucent flesh. The
tendril plays around Hallie’s face before, finally, touching
her cheek, like a caress.

This close, Hallie can recognize that Slender Man’s suit
isn’t a suit. His tie isn’t a tie. The “suit” is mottled,
fleshy. The tie is just a smear of reddish liquid. Where his
“face” should be is a roiling mass of some unknown substance.
Finally, a look of acceptance on Hallie’s face. And then...
The world brightens all around us. Shadows disappear as the
skies fill with light. Is it the first ray of light as the
sun peeks over the horizon? Or something else?

HALLIE GASPS AS A BLINDING LIGHT EXPLODES ALL AROUND HER!!
It slowly dissipates and we see the large gnarled oak tree.

But now it towers over a clearing in the woods. A silent,
empty void. An absence...

THE MANSION HAS VANISHED INTO NOTHING...

CUT TO:
Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 121.

INT. LIZZIE'S BEDROOM - MONTHS LATER -- NIGHT

Lizzie sits at her computer. Designing a MISSING FLYER with
HALLIE’S PICTURE on it.

We can see Lizzie has recovered from her mental episode. But
she’s definitely worse for wear. And then...

HALLIE (0.S.)
Lizzie...

Lizzie listens, not sure what she heard. She gets up and
crosses to her door. Opens it. Peers out. Nobody there...

But, just as Lizzie goes to close her door...

HALLIE (0.S.) (CONT’D)
Lizzie...

Lizzie turns. Exits her room to investigate...
LIZZIE
Hallie?
INT. HALLIE’S HOUSE - HALLWAY -- CONTINUOUS 111
Lizzie moves down the hall. Still nobody there.

HALLIE (0.S.)
Lizzie...

She sees the back door open. Heads that way...

EXT. HALLIE’S HOUSE -- NIGHT 112
Lizzie enters the backyard. Looks around.

LIZZIE
Hallie?

But nobody is there. Only the forest behind the house.

A tear rolls down Lizzie’s cheek as she searches the endless
trees. No Hallie. Just tangled branches. We can’t tell where
one ends and another begins...

And then we hear something. Unmistakable...

A BELL ECHOES IN THE FOREST.
Blue Rev. (06/09/16) 122.

And off Lizzie’s SCREAM we...

SMASH CUT TO
BLACK.

THE END.
