DARKNESS
We hear trickling water. Birds chirping.

Then... a sickening THUD. Flesh and bone striking something
hard. A SPLASH.

A WOMAN SCREAMS. In pain, dazed and incoherent. Water
violently overwhelming her breaths...
EXT. WATERING HOLE - MORNING

A small waterfall feeds a secluded swimming hole among the
Redwoods. Peaceful. Serene.

We move over the rocks near the water’s edge until... we
come across a thatch of matted, bloody hair.

A LIFELESS BODY rests in shallow water near the shore.

BLOOD trickles over a WOMAN’S HAND -- a pale strip of skin
where her wedding band once rested.

cur TO BLACK:

TITLE CARD -- TOTEM

EXT. SCOTTS VALLEY, CA - DAY
We snap out of the darkness into a new day.

A beautiful mountain town in the hills above Santa Cruz.

EXT. SCOTTS VALLEY HIGH SCHOOL - TRACK - DAY

ECU - A brand new running shoe. Youthful FEMALE HANDS enter
frame and SNAP the laces tight.

cU - A STARTER GUN FIRES.

cur TO:

EXT. SCOTTS VALLEY HIGH SCHOOL - TRACK - CONTINUOUS
SIX ATHLETIC HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS in the middle of a sprint.

KELLIE CALDWELL (17) -- confident, smart and centered beyond
her years -- quickly pulls ahead of four of the girls.

Almost at the front... she trails the WINNER by a hair.
SWISH. The winner breaks through the ribbon. Kellie in close
succession. APPLAUSE from the stands.

Kellie briefly winces at her loss -- then smiles and waves
to the crowd.

cur TO:

MOMENTS LATER
Time for a picture.

Kellie holds a SECOND PLACE MEDAL aloft and wraps an arm

around JAMES CALDWELL (early 40’s) -- her handsome, proud
father.
Posed at their feet is little sister ABBY (8) -- almost too

shy to smile.
A moment with the happy family... SNAP!

TODD (17) -- athletic and kind -- is kept to the sidelines.
Forever stuck in the friend zone.

Kellie approaches him and he attempts to hug her. She
inadvertently RECOILS but saves the moment with a smile.

KELLIE
(nervous laugh)
Come on, I’m all sweaty.

She glances at her family to make sure they didn’t see.

INT./EXT. JAMES’ CAR - NIGHT

Kellie and Abby eat celebratory ice cream as James navigates
the winding road.

James pulls to a stop at a deserted RED LIGHT.

JAMES
You killed it out there.

KELLIE
I guess. It'd be nice to win at
some point...

JAMES
You got a trophy, didn't you?

KELLIE
So did two other girls.
JAMES
Well, I'm allowed to be proud of
you.

ABBY
Are you proud of me too?

JAMES
Of course I am.

ABBY
For what?

JAMES
For bucking the trend.

ABBY
What does that mean?

JAMES
It means that I'm proud of how
unique you are. You're going to
grow up to be something special.

KELLIE
(lightly teasing)
Our special snowflake.
EXT. CALDWELL HOUSE - NIGHT
They pull into the driveway of a nice, semi-secluded house
in the hills.
INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

James and the girls are in bed -- Abby in the middle -- the
comforter pulled up around them.

He grabs the Apple remote.

JAMES
What'1ll it be?

KELLIE
It's your turn.

JAMES
You're the big winner. You decide.

KELLIE
You never choose. You should get
some say around here at some point.
JAMES
(re: Abby)
Frozen?
KELLIE

If that's how you want to spend
your turn. You'll both be asleep so
quick it won't matter.

JAMES
That, my young lady, is BS.

cur TO:

INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

James and Abby are fast asleep. The TV illuminates the room.

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

Kellie rinses dishes -- part of her routine -- and places
them in the drying rack.

Her eyes linger on the soapy water... bubbles swirl across
the surface...

We PUSH IN on her face... lost in thought...

We see the sink get perilously full then OVERFLOW. Water
starts to pool at her feet.

She snaps out of it, shuts the sink off and grabs a rag.

INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

She covers James with the blanket, picks Abby up and carries
her out of the room.

INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

BEEP! BEEP! BEEP! The motion sensors go off as Kellie
carries Abby through the room.

KELLIE
(quietly)
Yeah, yeah.
INT. ABBY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Kellie tucks Abby in.

It's SHIVERING COLD. She tries to shut the window over the
bed -- but it's stuck.

She PUSHES harder... it comes loose. Almost slamming shut
before Kellie catches it again...

Kellie glances down at Abby. Thankfully still asleep.

INT. KELLIE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Kellie carefully hangs her newest prize on the large TROPHY
SHELF that hangs over her bed.

Winning trophies, medals and ribbons from throughout the
years are arranged chronologically from left to right.

All of them are SECOND or THIRD PLACE. Except for the very
first one -- World's Best Daughter.

She gets in bed and pulls up the covers. Satisfied.

As soon as she shuts her eyes -- WHISPERS from another room.

INT. ABBY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Kellie enters to find Abby standing in a corner of the
room -- whispering at the wall.

KELLIE
What are you doing?

ABBY
Talking...

KELLIE
Aren't you a little old for
imaginary friends?

She walks over to Abby, places her hands on her shoulders,
and steers her back to bed.

ABBY
But I'm not tired anymore.

Abby lays in bed, letting Kellie pull the covers over her.
KELLIE
What do you mean? You're not
scared, are you?

ABBY
No.
KELLIE
So why can't you go back to sleep?
ABBY
Because.
KELLIE

Well, count some sheep or
something, alright? It'll make my
job easier.
Kellie playfully pinches her cheek and gets up to leave.
As she reaches the door she glances back at Abby... somewhat
unsettled by all of this.
INT. KITCHEN - MORNING
Eggs in a pan. Bacon sizzling. Toast POPS out of a toaster.

Kellie cooks breakfast for three. Been doing it for years.

Abby shuffles in wearing COWGIRL BOOTS over her tights.

KELLIE
Nope, inappropriate.
ABBY
Why?
KELLIE

Just one of those society things,
sis. Go change.

James -- wearing a bathrobe -- passes by Abby as he heads to
the fridge.

JAMES
(to Kellie)
Need any help?

KELLIE
You don't have time to help. Get
dressed.
James looks down at his bathrobe and nods -- ‘you're right'.
He gives her a quick kiss on the forehead.

JAMES
What would I do without you?

James turns and heads back to his room -- leaving Kellie to
beam with pride over her successful morning routine.
INT. KITCHEN - LATER THAT MORNING

Kellie and Abby eat breakfast. Playful. Not a care in the
world.

James, now dressed, sits between them. Nervous about

something -- he takes a deep breath.
KELLIE
What is it?
JAMES
Nothing... I just... I think it's
time we talk about --
KELLIE
Oh no.
ABBY

What is it?

KELLIE
Not what. Who. Her.
(to James)

When?
JAMES
Next week.
ABBY
I like her.
KELLIE
Look, I just want you to be happy.
JAMES
Me too.
KELLIE

But can I just say one thing?
And it's about what's right for
you, so you can't get mad.
JAMES
I reserve the right to get mad, but

go ahead.
KELLIE
I'd rather see you with someone...
else.
JAMES
And now I am a little mad.
KELLIE
Why?
JAMES

Because you don't get a vote now.
You get a vote at the beginning,
between our third and fourth date.
Not a year and a half later.

KELLIE
I'm sorry I just...

JAMES
I've played more than fair. I
haven't had her over for sleepovers

KELLIE
TMI.

JAMES
-- that you know of.

KELLIE
Way TMI.

JAMES

And now I want her in my life. Our
lives, actually. You could use some
help around here. You can just be
seventeen. Real seventeen, not
superhero seventeen.

Kellie leans back in her chair, annoyed. This is a battle
she cannot win.

KELLIE
I like superhero seventeen.

cur TO:
EXT. BEER THIRTY - NIGHT
The patio of a laid back gastropub. James sits across from
ROBIN (29) -- warm, sunny and ever so slightly "off."
JAMES
Are you kidding? The girls love
you.
ROBIN

He smiles

Really? I just get this feeling...

JAMES
Look, it's a shake-up. But I know
it'll be a good one.

ROBIN
I don't want them to associate me
with disruption.

JAMES
Sometimes disruption is good. I
need disruption.

ROBIN
I know. But I remember that age.
Seventeen? She'll have an opinion.

JAMES
Are you having second thoughts?
Because the moving deposit's --

ROBIN
No! No. I wanna make it work either
way. I'm just thinking out loud. I
think I could be a good friend to
them, you know?
(beat)
And a good partner to you.

JAMES
Wow.

and takes her hand.

JAMES (cont'd)
What a toxic presence you'll be.

INT. UHAUL - DAY

TIGHT on Robin. She stands in front of a mirror -- steeling
herself for something.
10.

A CRAMPED SPACE containing lots of new-age CERAMIC
SCULPTURES and the EQUIPMENT to make them. It looks like
we're in her apartment...

She braces herself in front of the mirror and takes a calm,
reassuring breath.

ROBIN
You can do this.

She takes a few steps towards the exit...

EXT. CALDWELL HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

... and steps outside. Revealing the UHAUL in the driveway.

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

Kellie and Abby sit on the floor -- taking in the progress.
The family CAT sits between them.

The SCULPTURES stick out like a sore thumb in their new
environment.

Robin kneels down to Kellie and Abby’s eyeline.

ROBIN
I just want to thank you girls for
letting me into your home and your
hearts. You know I love your dad
and I’m looking forward to being

your --
ABBY
Mom?
KELLIE
Sister?
ROBIN
I could be a bit of both. A
Momster.
KELLIE
Now that has a ring to it.
ROBIN
You're right. We’ll just vibe it

out.

Abby notices James removing a single PICTURE from the wall.
He places it in a box and heads to his room. She follows.
11.

INT. MASTER BEDROOM - DAY

James removes a couple of photos from his dresser and adds
them to the box.

Behind him -- an ELECTRICIAN installs a custom CHANDELIER
above the bed. Ceramic and glass. Sculpted by Robin.

ABBY
What are you doing?

JAMES
It’s a new start, right?

ABBY
She doesn’t know you were married?

JAMES
Of course she does. It’s about
making her feel at home. And it’s a
new start for me too.

Abby pries one of the pictures away from him.

Their family as it was five years ago -- James, Kellie (then
12), Abby (then 3) and LEXY (early 30’s).

Lexy was luminous. Big eyes that could find a lie anywhere.

ABBY
I don’t remember her.

JAMES
Well, there won’t be a test. You
were three.

James kneels down next to her and looks at the picture.

JAMES (cont'd)
She loved you very much.
(thinks )
We can put this in your room if you
want. Would you like that?

Abby smiles and nods. Robin enters -- surprised by the
chandelier.

ROBIN
Wow. It's up already?

JAMES
Yep.
12.

ROBIN
Are you sure it... fits?

JAMES
(lying)
Yep.

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

Kellie roams among the boxes and knick-knacks infecting her
house. There’s definitely some annoyance simmering up.

INT. CALDWELL HOUSE - FOYER - DAY

Robin is unpacking DOZENS OF BOOKS and placing them on the
shelves. New age stuff. Some YA fiction. Some poetry and
eastern religion selections sprinkled in.

Kellie reaches for one called ‘The Replacement Mother: How
Not To Be a Wicked Stepmom.'

KELLIE
Good stuff. You make it all the way
through this one?

Robin -- simultaneously gentle and firm -- removes the book
from Kellie’s hands. She knows when she’s being made fun of.

ROBIN
Can't blame me for trying.

KELLIE
(backpedaling)
Well you know Abby's kind of weird.
If you need any help, you can just
ask me. There's no book for her.
Robin smiles.

ROBIN
Thanks. That would be great.
EXT. BACKYARD - NIGHT

James -- draped in a bloody apron -- opens up the grill and
inspects a delicious looking tri-tip.

A bottle of LIGHTER FLUID at his side.
13.

INT. DINING ROOM - LATER

Robin plates the food as Abby sits in her chair giggling and
talking to... no one.

ABBY
(girlish and formal)
You'll have to wait. It’s dinner

time.
Kellie throws a look at Robin -- 'see what I mean?'

ROBIN

When did this start?
KELLIE

Just the other day.

(to Abby)

Abs. What's the deal?
ROBIN

I guess imaginary friends can be

healthy.
KELLIE

Not as healthy as real ones.

ROBIN
Meh, let her explore.

KELLIE
I'm sorry did you just say "meh?"
Like, phonetically?

ROBIN
Is that not how you do it?

KELLIE
No, momster. Internet only. You
sure you're only twenty-nine?

ROBIN
Just different interests I guess.
Robin's smile fades a bit -- Kellie decides to ease up a
little.
KELLIE
Good for you. I'd love to unplug.
(beat)

Plus it's probably just the
generation gap.
14.

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

BLOOD oozes out as James carves the tri-tip.

INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

The “new” Caldwell family settles in for dinner. Kellie and
Abby prepare to dig into their steak.

Robin swoops in and sprinkles a bunch of SEEDS on their meat
right before their forks make contact.

KELLIE
Sesame seeds?

ROBIN
Hemp seeds.

KELLIE
So what, am I going to be stoned
all night?

ROBIN
Of course not.

KELLIE
I run track. They test, you know.

ROBIN
It won’t show up.
(reconsiders)
And if it did it’s not like weed
ever made anyone faster.

JAMES
It’s okay, Kellie.

ROBIN
Its got Omega 3’s. Your dad loves
it.

JAMES

Load me up.

Robin sprinkles seeds on his steak as he glares at Kellie --
‘give her a break.’

KELLIE
Actually it just adds a little
extra crunch. I like it.

ROBIN
Your brain likes it too.
15.

James sets his fork down and raises a glass of wine.
JAMES
I'd just like to take this
opportunity to welcome Robin into
our home...
(looks into Robin's eyes)
«+. and into our family.

Everyone CLINKS their glasses. Kellie and Robin exchange
nervous looks as they move their glasses in for a toast...

SMASH. Robin's glass shatters in her hand. Everyone at the
table startles.

JAMES (cont'd)
Jesus!

ROBIN
Ouch.

Blood drips from Robin's hand.

KELLIE
Are you okay?

Robin gets up, heads to the sink and washes off the wound.
ROBIN
Yeah, can you just grab me a paper
towel?

Kellie grabs a roll of paper towels and heads over to Robin.

BLOOD trickles down Robin's finger into the water in the
sink. Oddly similar to the image in the opening scene.

KELLIE
Yikes.

Robin rinses the wound. It's tiny. Kellie presses the paper
towel into Robin's palm.
INT. KELLIE'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

Kellie flosses and brushes her teeth. All of her movements
controlled and efficient. Almost comically precise.

A NOISE from inside her room. She turns her head...
16.

INT. KELLIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Kellie steps from her bathroom into the bedroom.

WHOOSH. The window opens. She JUMPS back and lets out a
gasp.

Todd pokes his head through.

KELLIE
Jesus Christ, you scared me.
(catches her breath)
You can't be here right now.

TODD
Why not?

KELLIE
My Dad's here.

Todd finishes climbing through the window.

TODD
He's never here on Tuesdays.

KELLIE
Well, now she's here and that's
changed.

On Todd -- 'Bummer.'

TODD
That sucks.

KELLIE
Didn't you see the cars?

Todd moves towards her... aiming for seductive, only
achieving awkward. She allows a laugh.

He leans in for a kiss but she pulls away.

KELLIE (cont'd)
We’ve talked about this.

TODD
Come on, we’ve been dancing around
it forever. You know we’re more
than friends.

KELLIE
How’s that?
17.

TODD
I can tell by the way you look at
me.

He leans in again.
TODD (cont'd)
They won’t hear anything. They’re
probably going at it right now.
KELLIE
And you think we should do it in
sync with them? Ew.
She gently pushes him away.

KELLIE (cont'd)
I don’t want to think of him that

way.
TODD

You mean with another woman?
KELLIE

What?!
TODD

Instead of your mom.
KELLIE
No. No one wants to think about
their dad doing anything.
INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

James and Robin are in fact not going at it. His advances
have been thwarted by some worrying on Robin's part.

A breeze blows in through the open window.
ROBIN

The seeds were stupid. I should
have asked before putting them on.

JAMES
It's not a big deal. She liked
them.

ROBIN

Yeah, but it's my first night here
and I'm messing with her food. Not
good.
18.

She shakes her head, lost in the past.
ROBIN (cont'd)
I was never cool in school.
Whenever I tried they just hated me
more.

INT. ABBY’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Abby's half asleep. The window by her bed is once again
open -- allowing a gentle breeze into the room.

She shivers a bit. Pulls the blanket tighter. Her feet are
still exposed. BRRR.

Abby's sheet LIFTS up. At first we think it’s the billowing
wind... until it’s PULLED down to cover her feet.

A quiet beat.

The open window SLAMS shut and the sheets pull TIGHT around
Abby -- literally imprisoning her on the bed.

INT. KELLIE’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Todd and Kellie hear Abby SCREAM! She heads for the door.
Todd follows.

INT. MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

James and Robin exchange looks and jump out of bed.

INT. ABBY’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Kellie and Todd run into Abby’s room. Abby’s curled up ina
ball on the bed.

KELLIE
What happened?

James enters the room -- worried.

INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Robin second guesses if she should go into Abby's room or
not -- 'I don't want to overstep my bounds.'

She sees something MOVING out of the corner of her eye.
19.

She turns her head. ‘What's that?'

She looks over to Kellie's room... the door is open... a
single trophy falls from Kellie's shelf to the ground.

She takes a step towards it... but Abby's crying grows
louder.

She takes a deep breath and heads into Abby's bedroom.

INT. ABBY'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
Robin enters and takes her place by James' side.

Todd lurks in the background -- almost hoping James won't
notice him.

ABBY
Someone slammed the window!

JAMES
Sweetie, no one slammed it.

James lifts the window. It’s loose. Slides down too easily.

JAMES (cont'd)
It fell.

Kellie takes a step towards Abby but Robin beats her to
it -- she watches as the new addition comforts her sister.

JAMES (cont'd)
I'll fix it later. It’s too cold to
be open anyway.
Robin pulls the sheet back onto Abby's bed.

James turns and locks eyes with Todd.

JAMES (cont'd)
And what's he doing here?

KELLIE
Getting me grounded?
EXT. CALDWELL HOUSE - NIGHT
Kellie ushers Todd out front. They shiver in the night air.
TODD

I don’t know what I was thinking. I
just wanted to help.
20.

KELLIE
Your heart was in the right place.
Just not your head.

TODD
You really going to be grounded?
KELLIE
Please. He’s wrapped around my
finger.
TODD

Pretty soon he'll be wrapped around
your stepmom's.

He pats her on the shoulder and heads to his car.
KELLIE
(calling out)
She’s not my stepmom!
TODD
Not yet.
INT. ABBY’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Kellie enters... Abby is nowhere to be seen.

WHISPERS from the closet. Kellie opens the door to find Abby
inside.

Abby looks up at her.

ABBY
I'm not scared anymore.
KELLIE
Good. Yeah, it was just a loud

noise.

She takes hold of Abby's hand and gently pulls her up and
out of the closet.

KELLIE (cont'd)
You've really gotta cut that out.

She guides Abby back into bed.

ABBY
I'm not tired.

KELLIE
I've heard that before.
(MORE)
21.

KELLIE (cont'd)
(sighs)

I can lay here for a bit if you

want.

Kellie crawls into bed with Abby. She notices the family
photo on her bedside table.

KELLIE (cont'd)
Dad give you that?

A beat while Abby considers her next thought.
ABBY

Why doesn’t daddy talk about how
she died?

KELLIE
Well, it’s not fun to talk about.
And mommy wasn’t... it wasn’t a

good time for daddy and mommy.
(switches gears)

All you need to know is that she

was amazing and she loved you.
(beat)

Lay on your front and I’1l show you

how she used to put me to sleep.

Abby lays on her stomach. Kellie places two fingers at the
small of her back and gently walks them up her spine.

KELLIE (cont'd)
(singing)

The itsy-bitsy spider went up the

water spout...

She quickly trails her fingers away from Abby’s neck.

KELLIE (cont'd)
(singing)

Down came the rain and washed the

spider out. Out came the sun and

dried up all the rain.

She walks her fingers back up.
KELLIE (cont'd)
And the itsy-bitsy spider climbed
up the spout again.

ABBY
Again.
22.

KELLIE
If you’re anything like I was
this'll take a while.
(sings)
The itsy-bitsy spider went up the
water spout...

We pan over from the bed to Abby's door... slightly open. An
EYE watches them from outside.
INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Robin -- in her nightgown -- watches from the darkness of
the hallway.

Maybe jealous... maybe just wanting to know how to take care
of Abby...

After a beat she turns and heads back to her bedroom.

INT. MASTER BATHROOM - NIGHT

Robin soaks in the tub -- a candle lit on the edge of the --
basin -- trying to unwind.

A KNOCK on the door. She startles.

JAMES (0.C.)
Everything okay in there?

ROBIN
Yep! Just trying to unwind.
(to herself)
And hoping this gets easier.

TAP.

A water drop falls from the shower head above and lands on
her forehead.

TAP.

Robin glances up at the shower head -- annoyed. Another
water drop forms then... TAP.

The candle FLICKERS as though wind blows over it. Robin
looks around... all the windows are closed.

TAP. TAP. Robin looks over to THE SINK -- which is now

dripping. 'Weird.'
23.

She gets out of the tub, puts on her bathrobe and heads to
the sink. She twists the faucet OFF.

TAP. A DROP of water strikes her forehead. She looks up...

.».. and sees a THIN LINE OF WATER stretching across the
ceiling from the shower -- stopping right over her head.

TAP.
She grabs a towel and blots the water from the ceiling.

She looks to the candle... which flickers again before going
out completely.

INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

Egg whites and spinach in a pan. Turkey bacon in the
microwave. Spelt toast POPS out of the toaster.

A healthier, more hippy-ish version of the breakfast we saw
earlier.

Kellie practically skips in only to stop in her tracks as
she discovers Robin has taken over her duties.

ROBIN
Breakfast?

KELLIE
You know, you don't have to do
this. I normally get it. Part of my
routine.

ROBIN
Oh no, you've got school. You
probably have to cram for tests or
whatever. It'll be my routine.

KELLIE
I really think Abby's used to --

Abby -- happily munching away -- looks up from her plate.

ABBY
This is good!

Kellie sighs, grabs a plate and takes her seat.

DING! A laptop on the table chimes. Robin runs over to it
and clasps her hands excitedly.
24.

ONSCREEN -- Robin’s Etsy page. Her sculptures actually sell
like crazy.

ROBIN
Sold another one!

ABBY
Of those things?

Kellie stifles a laugh.

KELLIE
(whispers to Abby)
Be nice.

Robin grabs a plate of food and joins them at the table.

ROBIN
(to Abby)
You get back to sleep okay after
your little adventure?

ABBY
Yeah. The window didn't fall like
dad said, though.

ROBIN
Oh no?

ABBY
I was cold so she shut it.

ROBIN
Who shut it?

KELLIE
I don't think --

ABBY
I think it was Mom.

The air is sucked out of the room.

KELLIE
Abby, it wasn't Mom okay? Mom's not
here anymore.

ROBIN
Oh, I’m sure she’s here in some
way.

Robin reaches out with both arms, grabs Kellie and Abby by
the hands, and closes her eyes.
25.

ROBIN (cont'd)
(like she's acknowledging
a presence)
Lexy, it’s an honor to be in your
home with your two beautiful girls.

Kellie pulls her hands away.

KELLIE
Are you trying to talk to a ghost?
Because ghosts are scary. Even if
they're Mom.
(to Abby)
Which it's not.

ROBIN
Of course not. I was thinking more
along the lines of a therapeutic --

KELLIE
Not talking to walls is
therapeutic.

ROBIN
(to Abby)
What makes you think it's her? Why
now?

ABBY
She’s always been here. I just
wasn’t looking for her.

sharp in his suit.

KELLIE
See? Now it's in her head.
James enters the kitchen -- already dressed and looking
JAMES
(to Robin)

ON KELLIE
obscuring

Will you look at this? I'm running
on time for once.

-- James gives Robin a quick kiss on the forehead,
Kellie's face from the frame as he does so.

INT. KELLIE’S BEDROOM - MORNING

Kellie’s SKIPPING ROPE. Always training. James KNOCKS on the
side of her open door.

JAMES
Hey kiddo.
26.

KELLIE
Hey pops.

JAMES
Listen, I need you to do me a
solid.

KELLIE

What’s that?

JAMES
How would you feel about
integrating Robin a little more?

KELLIE
She’s been here 24 hours and I’m
two for two on meals.

JAMES
I just want her to feel welcome,
you know?

He gestures to one of Robin's sculptures in the hallway --
still wrapped in plastic from the move.

JAMES (cont'd)
And you could stand to do a little
decorating.
Her face drops.

KELLIE
Did she ask you to do this?

JAMES

No. And it'll play a lot better if

it's your idea.
EXT. CALDWELL HOUSE - DAY
A GARAGE SALE.
Kellie, Abby and James man a table in the front yard. Boxes
and knick-knacks litter the table. An old VCR, a sculpture
of Robin's, a pair of old Rollerblades.

No customers so far...

ABBY
Why are we selling our stuff?
27.

JAMES
Well, it's not just our stuff. It's
her stuff too. We're both getting
rid of what we don't need so
everything fits together.

KELLIE
(rolls her eyes)
Yeah, her stuff meshes.

A car pulls up.

KELLIE (cont'd)
I didn't know Grandpa was coming.

JAMES
I don't want to get rid of anything
he'd want.

The car door opens and BERNARD (65) -- a swaggering, portly
curmudgeon -- steps outside.
BERNARD
Hey there... fam.
JAMES KELLIE
Hi, Bernard. Hi, Bernard.
ABBY

Hi, Grandpa!
Bernard bends down and gives Abby a hug.

BERNARD
How's my favorite grandkid?
(winks up at Kellie)
Just kidding, it's a tie.

Robin emerges carrying a big box -- she heads over to the
table and sets it down.

ROBIN
Hi! I'm Robin!
James stands up -- flustered.
BERNARD

Hey there, I'm Bernard.

JAMES
I can't believe you guys haven't
met. Robin, Bernard's my father in
law.
28.

Robin does the math in her head -- 'oh.'

BERNARD
It's okay, darlin'. Life goes on.
Nice to meet you.

Bernard goes off to play with Abby while Robin starts
unpacking the box.

She pulls out a few DVD's and some books. Then -- she slowly
pulls out an OLD NECKLACE -- somehow both ornate and
tasteful.

Robin looks at it curiously. Kellie's eyes widen with anger.

KELLIE
What are you doing? We can't sell
that!

ROBIN
Oh, I'm sorry. It didn't seem like
your style.

Kellie takes the necklace from her.

KELLIE
This was my Mom's.

ROBIN
Oh, Kellie. You know I would
never --

BERNARD
Everyone simmer down.

Bernard wheezes a bit... pulls out an INHALER and takes a
puff as he heads over to take a look.

BERNARD (cont'd)
I don’t remember that one.

ROBIN
Turquoise is a healing stone.
(beat)
It also keeps people from
overreacting.

BERNARD
Why don't you put it on?

KELLIE
Oh no, I don't think --
29.

BERNARD
Come on. If you want it you should
wear it.
Kellie carefully drapes the necklace over her head... it

rests perfectly around her neck.

ROBIN
It looks beautiful on you, Kellie.

Robin hands the box she took the necklace from over to
Kellie.

ROBIN (cont'd)
You should really be the one to go
through this.

Bernard pats Robin on the back and steers her towards the
table full of knick-knacks.

BERNARD

Now let's take a look at the rest

of this garbage.
INT. KELLIE'S BEDROOM - DAY
Kellie shuts the door behind her.
She quickly pulls off the necklace.... places it in her
dresser drawer... and closes it.
INT. SCOTTS VALLEY HIGH SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - DAY

A lethargic SCIENCE TEACHER lectures. Kellie sits in front
of all the other STUDENTS.

SCIENCE TEACHER
And what does the law of
conservation of energy state?

An OVEREAGER STUDENT shoots her hand up. The Science Teacher
nods in her direction.

OVEREAGER STUDENT
That energy can neither be created
or destroyed.

Kellie just stares ahead. Lost in thought.
SCIENCE TEACHER

Very good. What can energy do under
this law?
30.

Overeager Student shoots her hand up again.

KELLIE
(blurts out)
Change form.

SCIENCE TEACHER
That's correct.
(beat)
Although we still raise our hands
around here.

BZZZ. She reaches into her bag and grabs her cell phone.

ON PHONE -- 3 MISSED CALLS and VOICEMAILS from ‘Abby
School.’

Kellie raises her hand.

KELLIE
I'm sorry, can I be excused?

EXT. SCOTTS VALLEY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY

Kellie pulls into the elementary school parking lot. She
jumps out of her car and RUSHES inside.

ADMINISTRATOR (0.S. FILTER)
Hi Kellie, we’re having a bit of a
problem with Abby. We were actually
wondering if you could come get
her?

INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - FRONT OFFICE - DAY

Kellie approaches a SCHOOL ADMINISTRATOR at her desk.

KELLIE
Hi, you guys called. I'm here to
get Abby.

ADMINISTRATOR

She's not here.

KELLIE
What do you mean?

ADMINISTRATOR
Her mom picked her up.
31.

KELLIE
Okay, her mom is dead. You know
that, right?

ADMINISTRATOR
(whoops )
I'm so sorry. Not her mom. That
pretty young lady. Your father
added her to the list. She was
upsetting the other kids...

KELLIE
wh , annoyed)
Ly?

ADMINISTRATOR
She told them she... could talk to
the dead. The kids got in her face.
Made fun of her.

INT. KELLIE'S CAR - CONTINUOUS

Kellie gets into her car -- whips out her phone and dials
‘Dad.’

It goes to voicemail.

JAMES (0.S. FILTER)
You’ve reached James. I’m over
forty, so feel free to leave a
message.
KELLIE
(into phone)
You gave Robin Mom privileges?
Isn’t that a little fast?
(beat)
At least someone’s still doing your
job for you.

She angrily hangs up.

EXT. CALDWELL HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Kellie pulls into the driveway.

INT. CALDWELL HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY

Robin and Abby walk down the hall towards her room.
32.

ROBIN
You know the kids at my school
picked on me too.

ABBY
They did?

ROBIN
Big time. I was a little bit
different like you are.

ABBY
How?

Robin takes a long inhale, smiles and kneels down to her.

ROBIN
Us weird ones, we've got to stick
together.
(beat)
Come on, I've got a surprise for
you.

INT. ABBY’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Abby bounds into her room with Robin following. On her bed
is a WOODEN BOX. She slowly opens it...

INSIDE -- PICTURES of Lexy and Abby together. A LOCK OF

HAIR.

ROBIN
I found this stuff during the
garage sale. I figure if Kellie
gets the necklace... I wanted to
save something for you.

ABBY
(holding the box)
You made this for me?

ROBIN
I think it’s important for you to
feel a connection with her. And to
know that I’m here for you, not to
take her place.

INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Kellie quietly sneaks up on Abby's room... peeks through the

open door.
33.

INT. ABBY'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Abby looks to the closet tentatively... almost as though
she's seeking permission from someone we can't see.

She nods to whatever she's looking at and then proceeds to
give Robin a hug.

ROBIN
Awww. I'm fitting in already?
Kellie enters -- her eyes lock on the box.
KELLIE
Is that my mom's stuff?
ROBIN
I thought --
KELLIE

Can you ask before doing things
like this please? She's already
fixated.

ROBIN
Your dad and I discussed it.

Kellie sighs... she'll let this one go. She sits on the bed
next to Abby.

KELLIE
She can have it. It's just weird to
see this stuff again. I miss her.

ROBIN
Of course you do.

Kellie pulls the photo out of the box and gazes at it.
KELLIE
She was great.
(ill-timed glance at Robin)
One of a kind.
INT. MASTER BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT
James and Robin are post-coital in bed.
JAMES

What you did for Abby today was
really sweet.
34.

ROBIN
I just don't want her to think I'm
trying to replace this perfect mom.
(almost in tears)
I already feel like I'm trying to
replace a perfect wife.

JAMES
Who says you're not perfect?
ROBIN
Part of you has to wish she was
still here.
JAMES

Of course. I loved her very much.
But she's not here. You are. And
you're not second fiddle. She was
my first choice then, but you're my
first choice now.

(beat)
Besides, it's not like things were
perfect at the end.

ROBIN
How?

James takes a deep breath.

ROBIN (cont'd)
If you don't want to talk about
it --

JAMES
No, it's okay. She was just
distant, you know? Like something
was sucking the joy out of her.
(beat)
I mean, she wasn't wearing her ring
when she died.

ROBIN
I'm sorry, James.

JAMES

It's not all her fault, you know? I
could have done a better job. I was
checked out, not involved enough
with the kids...

(beat)
So now I just wonder. About
everything.

He rolls on his side to face her.
35.

JAMES (cont'd)
Promise me something, okay?

ROBIN
Of course.

JAMES
Keep me in the loop. Don't let me
wonder.

INT. KELLIE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Kellie stares at the moon outside her window. Something
catches her attention...

A HORRIFYING vision in the corner. Moonlight bears down on
it like an evil, black tree growing out of the floor.

She flicks on the lights... it’s just that sculpture of
Robin's.

KELLIE
Great.

INT. ABBY’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Abby lays on her stomach, singing softly to herself.

ABBY
(singing)
The itsy-bitsy spider went up the
water spout...

In the background -- her bedroom door slowly CLOSES.

ABBY (cont'd)
(singing)
Down came the rain and washed the
spider out... out came the sun and
dried up all the rain...

A breeze from nowhere waffles the sheets.
ABBY (cont'd)
(singing)
...and the itsy-bitsy spider
climbed up the spout again.

Inching closer to sleep, she starts the song again.
36.

ABBY (cont'd)
(singing)
The itsy-bitsy spider climbed up
the water spout...

INVISIBLE FINGERS walk up her back as she sings along,
pressing into her pajamas.

ABBY (cont'd)
Kellie I didn’t know--

She turns over. No one’s there. She bolts upright in bed and
looks around.

ABBY (cont'd)
Kellie?

No one's there. A completely empty room. Abby glances at the
box of Lexy's on her nightstand.

ABBY (cont'd)
Mommy ?

Her eyes lock on something offscreen.

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

We slowly pull away from Abby’s door and into the hallway.
As we depart... we hear her TALKING.

INT. KELLIE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

ANGLE -- Robin’s sculpture. Still downright horrifying in
the moonlight.

Kellie grabs a blanket and tosses it over the sculpture.

Then -- a KNOCKING sound. She scans the room, trying to
place it...

...her dresser drawer shakes. Or did she imagine it?
She heads to her dresser and opens the drawer.
The necklace.

She pulls it out and holds it. Fingers the interlocking
rivets... concerned...

BEEP! BEEP! BEEP! The entry/exit alert from the motion
detector system.
37.

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Kellie investigates -- absentmindedly gripping the necklace.
BEEP! BEEP! BEEP!

Something stirs at the dark end of the room. She approaches
slowly... leans down to look...

THE CAT JUMPS OUT.

She jumps back -- dropping the necklace.

At that exact moment a stack of magazines TOPPLES off a
nearby table. They fall in the same direction as the

necklace.

Kellie glances back and forth from the necklace on to the
pile of magazines on the floor.

She picks up the necklace -- the curtains across the room
SWAY UP AND DOWN -- echoing the motion of the necklace as
she lifts it...
She backs away... frightened...
Then... the cat scurries across the room.
WHAM! She bumps into James -- scaring the shit out of both
of them.

JAMES

I was hoping that was you sneaking
in or something.

KELLIE
I’m grounded, remember?

JAMES
(give me a break)
You're never really grounded.

James and Kellie check the front door. Locked. He hits a
button. The alarm stops.

JAMES (cont'd)
Motion detector. Abby’s in her
room, right?
Kellie nods.

BEEP! BEEP! BEEP! It goes off again. ‘What the fuck?’
38.

Then... the cat SCURRIES into the room. James sighs and
flicks the alarm off.

KELLIE

(wary)
He never sets this off.

JAMES
Yeah, but you've been feeding him
too much.
(beat)
You're not starting to believe this
ghost stuff, are you?

KELLIE
I...
(covering)
... of course not.

JAMES
Exactly. Team cat.

James yawns and pats Kellie on the shoulder.
JAMES (cont'd)
Going back to bed, kiddo. You
should too.

KELLIE
In a second.

She scoops the cat up and heads into the kitchen.

INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Kellie -- the cat still cradled in one arm -- walks slowly.
She holds out the necklace and sways it front of her.
Nothing.

BEEP! BEEP! BEEP! The hallway detector BEHIND her.

A chill comes over her -- she looks at the cat cradled
against her.

KELLIE
Why couldn’t it be you?

She lets the cat fall to the floor and follows as it
scurries out of the room.
39.

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

The cat runs up to Kellie's door -- PURRING and rubbing
against it. A friendly reception for whatever's inside...

Kellie slowly approaches her room and reaches for the door.
She PULLS her hand away -- it's dripping. The handle is WET.

She opens her door slowly...

INT. KELLIE’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
Kellie scans her room... empty. Still.

She glances to the sculpture ... the blanket she threw over
it billows. 'Is something under there?'

Her eyes move to the trophy shelf. One small trophy on the
end is turned askance. 'Weird.'

She slowly stalks toward the display, eyes peeled for
anything unusual, and fixes it.

Her closet door is open. ‘Fuck.’ She heads over to close it.
PLOP. She spins around to see a trophy on the carpet.
She turns back to the closet -- the door SLAMS shut.

PLOP. Kellie spins around again. Another trophy on the
floor.

Kellie doesn’t know what to make of it.

They start falling... one by one... PLOP. PLOP. PLOP.
Kellie moves to the shelf... then peers down at her hand --
the necklace TIGHTENS around her palm. Painfully... like a

noose.

BAM! The SHELF TOPPLES over -- sending the trophies and
their sharp metal edges down almost all over her.

She STUMBLES BACK and FALLS.

The necklace slips free, bounces off the floor, slipping
under the black recesses of her dresser.

She catches a glimpse of herself in the mirror -- SOMETHING
is behind her.

Undefined, dark... almost wraith-like.

 
40.

Terrified, she peers into the mirror...

ABBY (0.C.)
I told you. It's Mom.

Kellie SCREAMS and spins around. Abby stands in the doorway.

KELLIE
No. Mom wouldn't do this. Mom
wouldn't make us feel like this!

ABBY
She did Itsy-Bitsy.

KELLIE
(whispers, scared)
It was watching us...

ABBY
Sometimes she whispers things...

KELLIE
What does she say? Has she said
anything about us?

Abby thinks...

ABBY
She asked about the necklace.

KELLIE

Abby, I know I made a big deal
about that necklace, but I was just
mad at Robin. I was being a jerk.
Mom hated that thing. I don’t know
who gave it to her and I never saw
her wear it.

(beat)
I need you not to talk to this
thing.

ABBY
Why? I like her.

Kellie grabs Abby by the shoulders.

KELLIE
Abby, I’m your sister. I love you.
I would never lie to you. You've
got to trust me. Do you trust me?

ABBY
...yes.
41.

KELLIE
Whatever this is... stay away from
it.

James and Robin arrive to investigate the racket.

JAMES
(taking in the mess)
What the hell happened?

Kellie bends down and grabs the WORLDS BEST DAUGHTER trophy
off the floor.

KELLIE
Robin, can you take Abby back to
her room please?

ROBIN
(re: the mess)
But let me help you-

KELLIE
Please, Robin. Abby, remember what
I said.

Robin steers Abby into the hall. James pulls Kellie aside.
JAMES

Kellie, are you trying to...
sabotage this?

KELLIE
Sabotage what?
JAMES
You know... me and Robin.
KELLIE

(re: the destroyed room)
You think I did this? This thing is
real.

(thinks )
Maybe whatever was “bothering” Mom
is now bothering Abby too.

 

JAMES
What do you mean?

KELLIE
We both know Mom was acting weird
at the end.
42.

JAMES
That’s not what happened. She was
depressed.

James gently takes the WORLD'S BEST DAUGHTER trophy from her
and places it back on the shelf.

KELLIE
You don’t believe me do you?

James surveys the toppled shelf and the trophies strewn
throughout the room -- not knowing what to think.

INT. KELLIE'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

Kellie examines herself in the mirror... there are RED WELTS
on her hand where the necklace tightened around it.

INT. KELLIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Kellie bends down on her hands and knees to peer into the
darkness under the dresser.

She reaches in... feels around... grappling in the
darkness... and finally pulls out the necklace.
She studies it... mesmerized. She pulls the blanket off the

sculpture, wraps herself up in it and climbs into bed.

She gazes up at the necklace for a moment before hiding it
under her pillow.

INT. DINING ROOM - MORNING

The family eats -- but everything feels stilted. A nervous
energy in the air. The only person not tense is Abby...
happily munching away at her breakfast.

ABBY
Maybe it's good that Mom's back.

Kellie glares at James -- 'see?'

KELLIE
Abby, we talked about this.

JAMES
(to Abby)
For right now let's just focus on
what we can see.
43.

ABBY
But I do see her.

KELLIE
You're seeing what it wants you to
see.

ROBIN

Kellie, you're feeling a lot of
upheaval right now and this is the
anxiety manifesting itself.

JAMES
Maybe there is something here,
Robin. I honestly don't know.

ROBIN
I just think everyone's on edge and
reading into the wrong things.

KELLIE
What about my room?

ROBIN
Maybe the shelf couldn't handle the
weight.
(smiles)
A testament to your hard work.

KELLIE
Do those Dr. Spock books tell you
to ignore all danger to your
family?

JAMES
Enough. Whatever's going on, we're
still a family. Let's act like it,
okay?
Kellie grabs her backpack.
KELLIE
(annoyed)
Totally.
James looks at his watch.

JAMES
Shoot, we've gotta go too.

James scoops Abby out of her seat and heads out of the
kitchen.

Robin is left alone.
44,

She sighs -- 'what a mess' -- and takes another bite of food
and washes it down with some water.

... GULP. Something's caught in her throat -- threatening
her gag reflex.

She pulls the glass away and notices a SINGLE STRAND OF HAIR
hanging from her mouth.

Unable to swallow -- she opens her mouth and PULLS the
strand out... finally excavating a CLUMP OF MATTED HAIR.

Terrified and disgusted -- she closes her eyes and quickly
stands up.

... when she opens her eyes she's holding just the single
strand again.

She looks around... creeped out... 'am I going crazy?'

EXT. SCOTTS VALLEY HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - DAY

Kellie sits behind the wheel of her car. Todd sits next to
her.

She’s just told him everything.

TODD
You really think this thing wants
to hurt you?

She nods.

TODD (cont'd)
Oh, come on.
(off Kellie's look)
I didn’t mean it like that. If it’s
something you're really feeling...

KELLIE
I don’t need sensitive Todd. I need
practical Todd.
Todd raises his hand.

TODD
Here.

KELLIE
So you don’t believe me either?
45.

TODD
I thought you wanted practical
Todd.

KELLIE

Actually, I want patient Todd.

TODD
Maybe you need a change of scenery.
At least next year we'll be a
thousand miles away.

KELLIE
Actually... I was thinking of
staying here.
TODD
What do you mean? We're going to
Boulder.
KELLIE
Not if I go to college in the city.
TODD
Why would you stay?
KELLIE
My family needs me, okay?
TODD
They'll be fine. They've got Robin

now.
Kellie shoots him a look.
TODD (cont'd)
Got it. Patient Todd.
EXT. SCOTTS VALLEY HIGH SCHOOL - TRACK - DAY
Track practice.

Kellie is at the starting line. Up against two students from
last time and TWO NEW RUNNERS from the same school.

TIGHT ON KELLIE -- her focus is eerily razor sharp. More
determined than ever.

cu - The starter gun fires.

Kellie starts ahead and stays there -- 'Yes! She's finally
gonna win!’
46.

She gives a quick glance to the STANDS -- and sees A FIGURE
standing at the top of the bench. ARMS OUTSTRETCHED. COVERED
BY A RIPPED BODY BAG. DRIPPING WET.

Kellie STUMBLES and CRASHES down into the track. Everyone
crosses the finish line without her.

She looks back up at the stands -- they're empty.

INT. SCOTTS VALLEY HIGH SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - DAY

Kellie’s in class. Tired. Distracted. BLOOD seeps through
the bandage on her leg.

SCIENCE TEACHER
And so what does Newton’s first law
tell us?

No one raises their hand. The teacher looks to Kellie...
she’s off in another world.

SCIENCE TEACHER (cont'd)
Ms. Caldwell?

KELLIE
(snaps out of it)
Yeah?

SCIENCE TEACHER
Newton's first law.

KELLIE
I... I’m sorry.

He pats her on the shoulder as he walks down the aisle.

SCIENCE TEACHER
An object that is at rest will stay
at rest until an external force
acts upon it. And --

Kellie absentmindedly mouths along with the next part...

SCIENCE TEACHER (cont'd)
An object in motion will not stop
until an external force acts upon
it.

She glances at her textbook -- a DIAGRAM displaying these
principles. An object at rest. An object in motion. An
external force. An object stopping.
47.

EXT. BACKYARD - DAY

Robin is on her knees PLANTING SEEDS in the dirt near the
deck, a glass of wine at her side.

BERNARD (0.C.)
Got a second?

Robin startles. Bernard enters the yard from the side.

ROBIN
Hey, Bernard. What's up?

BERNARD
I wanted to clear the air about
something since it seems like we're
going to be seeing more of each
other.

ROBIN
Uh... Sure.

BERNARD
You've probably guessed that I've
steered clear of meeting you these
past few years.

Robin wipes her hands on her jeans.

ROBIN
Yeah, I thought that might be the
case.
BERNARD
Well, I came to apologize. It's
just... at the time I didn’t know
what to think of it.
(beat)
Considering you knew her.
ROBIN
(flustered)

James and I got together three
years after the funeral, Bernard.
It's a circle of friends. Things
happen.

Bernard nods -- looks off in the distance.

BERNARD
I came to explain, not accuse. I'm
fine with it now. Like I said, life
goes on. I was just being a Dad.
48.

ROBIN
Well, I was as surprised as anyone
he asked me out. She’s not an easy
act to follow.

BERNARD
Have you told the girls?

ROBIN
James and I don't think it's a good
idea right now. It's such an uphill
battle already.

BERNARD
Kellie?

Robin bends back down and starts digging with her trowel --
like she’s angry.

ROBIN
Yep.
Bernard pulls out his inhaler... takes a puff.
BERNARD

She's a handful, alright. Likes to
be in charge, doesn't she? You
gotta fight or roll over with her.

Robin pauses on her response as she drops a handful of seeds
into the soil.

Then...

ROBIN
Don't worry, I'm not going
anywhere.

BERNARD
(chuckles )
Good luck with that. And call me if
you need anything. Lord knows James
never does.

ROBIN
Anytime.

Bernard makes his way back around the side of the yard.

Robin pulls out the hose to water the seeds -- notices a
LEAK where the tube screws into the water spout.

She grabs the spout handle to adjust it -- SPSHHH! It SPRAYS
her with water.
49.

She steps back -- 'great.'

EXT. CALDWELL HOUSE - DAY

Kellie's car pulls into the driveway as Bernard's pulls out.
Her eyes trail after him -- 'what's he doing here?

INT. CALDWELL HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Kellie arrives home and catches a glimpse of Robin through
the back windows.

Her eyes linger on Robin -- DRENCHED with water... MATTED
hair...
INT. KELLIE’S BEDROOM - DAY

Kellie closes the door behind her, opens the drawer and
pulls out the necklace.

She studies it, nervous -- ‘what the fuck am I thinking?’

EXT. CALDWELL HOUSE - NIGHT

Kellie's room is the only one with the lights on. Then...
they go out.

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

Kellie scouts around. Peering in everyone’s bedroom --
they’re all asleep.

She opens a closet and pulls down a SHOEBOX.

CU ON SHOEBOX -- Christmas ornaments and tchotchkes.

INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Kellie places a tiny SILVER BELL on her doorknob.

She moves down the hall towards the master bedroom and
places a silver bell on that doorknob as well.

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Kellie stands on a chair and pulls one of the MOTION
DETECTOR SENSORS down. Battery powered. No wires.
50.

She repeats this process in the remaining three corners of
the room collecting four sensors total.

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
Kellie places a chair in the center of the room then plants

the sensors around it in a circle. A clear enclosed area of
protection and visibility.

She activates the sensors -- BEEP! BEEP! BEEP! -- and sits
in the chair.

A text arrives on her phone from Todd -- ‘Good luck tonight.
I believe you.’ Then -- ‘Sure you don’t want company? Maybe

the ghost can watch us “leave the friend zone.”'

She sighs, tucks the phone in her pocket without answering,
then pulls out the necklace and cradles it in her hand.

Watches. Waits.

KELLIE
Come on, come on.

FADE TO:

INT. KITCHEN - LATER

PLUNK. The necklace hits the floor. Kellie wakes from an
accidental nap.

Her eyes dart around...
All the cabinets are wide open. 'Weird.'

She closes them... unnerved... and thinks for a beat.

EXT. PATIO - NIGHT

Kellie quietly exits to the patio and closes the door. She
shivers from the cool night air.

She pulls out her phone. A text from Todd. ‘Still up?’ She
DIALS and he picks up immediately.

TODD (0.S. FILTER)
So. Did it show up again?

KELLIE
Nothing that’1l convince them
they’re in danger.
51.
TODD (0.S. FILTER)
What made it appear last time?
This sparks a thought. Kellie quickly ends the call.
KELLIE
Let me call you back.
INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

Kellie pulls some cat treats out of one of the open
cabinets...

KELLIE
Here, kitty kitty.
The cat SCURRIES in -- BEEP! BEEP! BEEP! -- and jumps into
her lap.

The cat warily accepts the treat then turns to leave. Kellie
GRABS hold of it. It squirms in her lap, trying to get free.

The struggle grows. Kellie holds.
BEEP! BEEP! BEEP! Something just entered the kitchen!
The cat leaps out of her lap with a HISS.
Kellie JUMPS TO HER FEET.
The cat PURRS at something in the corner of the room.
KELLIE (cont'd)
(whispers)
Leave us alone!

BEEP! BEEP! BEEP! It just moved to the other side. Kellie
spins in its direction. Still nothing there.

BEEP! BEEP! BEEP! Kellie spins again behind her. The thing
is moving back and forth. She’s scared.

Defiant, Kellie lifts the necklace. Hesitant, a little
scared of it.

KELLIE (cont'd)
(whispers)
Here goes nothing.

Kellie lights a cigarette lighter and moves the FLAME to a
section of the necklace.
52.

SUDDENLY there is an ungodly SHRIEK -- a wraith-like black
specter appears in front of her.

Kellie gapes at the sight.

She WINCES in pain -- her hand is burning too -- as if the
necklace is resisting with its own unnatural heat.

She turns to face the living room -- DROPPING the lighter
and necklace.

INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

WHAM. Something invisible hits the floor. In pain.

We see FINGER MARKS -- five on each hand -- appear in the
carpet. They streak down into long lines... like this thing
is trying to crawl away in agony.

Kellie grabs the necklace and -- with two hands -- pulls
with all her might. The chain SNAPS in two.

The specter suddenly is sent HURLING forward -- freed by the
breaking of the chain... but still in agony.

Kellie DUCKS as it passes overhead and hugs the ground.

The invisible force SLAMS into the BOOKSHELF causing it to
wobble and fall forward -- in a split second shot we see the

cat standing inescapably in its path.

The cat -- hair puffed -- stares at Kellie just before the
shelf crashes down upon it.

EXT. BACKYARD - MORNING

Kellie digs a tiny GRAVE -- right where Robin planted her
seeds earlier. Tiny sprouted SEEDLINGS speck the dirt.

A PAW pokes out of the trash bag next to her.

James stands behind Kellie -- oblivious that she's digging
up Robin's stuff.

JAMES
How do we explain this to Abby?

KELLIE
He ran away? We sent him to a farm
where he can play?
53.

JAMES
I don’t like it. What were you
doing up so late? I don’t even
understand how this happened.

KELLIE
I told you how it happened!

JAMES
(sighs)
Your mother loved that cat.

Kellie stops digging, stands, faces him.

KELLIE
Dad. Whatever Abby's talking to is
real. It's here. It did this. And
it is not Mom. It's pretending to

be her.

(beat)
It wants something from Abby. I
don't know... to peel her away from
us.

James gently pries the trowel out of her hand, sticks it in
the ground, wraps an arm around her and starts walking.

JAMES
We need to talk.

Kellie looks up at him -- ‘uh oh.'

JAMES (cont'd)
Look, I'm open to the idea that
there's something here. Whether
it's your mom or --

KELLIE
Does part of you wish it was her?

JAMES
I'd have a few questions I guess.

KELLIE
People lose rings all the time.
Todd's dad lost his three times. It
doesn't mean she was --

JAMES
How'd you know about that?

KELLIE
I heard you talking about the
police report.
She stops

54.

JAMES
The point is, it's not your job to
fix this. We'll figure it out
together. In a way that doesn't
send Robin running for the hills.
She's only been here a few days,
you know?

KELLIE
Funny. Same timeline as this whole
thing.
JAMES
You don't know her like I do, okay?
(beat)

You've always been protective of
your sister and me. After your mom
died, you took on more than any
twelve year old should.

KELLIE
It's fine.

JAMES
No, it's not. It wasn't fine. And
now I'm grabbing the wheel.

walking.

KELLIE
What do you mean?

JAMES
You're wired to protect us. That’s
my fault. I should have been
stronger. But now it’s okay to just
be you. Alright?

KELLIE
So I'm being demoted.

JAMES
(laughs)
No. You're free. We don’t need to
be protected.

KELLIE
Well what are you going to do?
About this?

James smiles halfheartedly and shakes his head as they turn
around and head back.
55.

JAMES
I don't know. We'll figure
something out.

Kellie looks down as they walk along -- 'no you won't.'

INT. GARAGE - NIGHT

Robin digs through boxes marked ‘Lexy’ in the garage. With
purpose. Almost frantic.

Finally -- she finds what she’s looking for. A WEDDING RING.
James enters in his bathrobe...

JAMES
What are you up to, sweetie?

She swiftly turns and PLUNGES a KITCHEN KNIFE into his
chest.

cur TO:

INT. SCOTTS VALLEY HIGH SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - DAY
Kellie wakes from her dream SCREAMING. Everyone stares.

SCIENCE TEACHER
Everything alright, Ms. Caldwell?

She gathers her things and bolts for the door.
KELLIE
(sheepish)
I’m really sorry.
EXT. SCOTTS VALLEY HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - DAY
Todd comes running after Kellie as she marches to her car.

TODD
Hey! You alright?

KELLIE
I’ve gotta go.

TODD
I heard you freaked out in class.

KELLIE
It's nothing.
She slows

She stops

She turns

She shuts

TODD
In sociology they were talking
about totems. Some cultures think
physical objects can tie spirits to
the real world.

KELLIE
Yeah? And?

TODD
The necklace. You said it had some
kind of effect on it, right? Like
it was hurt?

and turns around.

TODD (cont'd)
I mean it sounds exactly like what
they were talking about.

KELLIE
Did they say anything about
destroying the spirit?

TODD
No. This isn’t Hogwarts, Kellie.

and heads back to her car.

TODD (cont'd)
Don’t you think you might be going
down a bit of a rabbit hole with
the ghosts and the voodoo stuff --

KELLIE
It’s not voodoo.

TODD
You know what I mean.

KELLIE
My family needs to know what this
thing really is. They don't know
what it's capable of.

the door, hits the ignition and takes off.

INT. KELLIE'S BATHROOM - DAY

Kellie soaks in the tub. An open bag of EPSOM SALT rests on

the rim.
57.

She pours some into the bath with her.

cur TO:

INT. KELLIE'S BATHROOM - LATER
Kellie steps out of the tub and wraps herself in a towel.

She bends down and pulls the PLUG from the tub's drain --

but nothing happens. No bubbles... the water just sits
there.

Kellie gets on her knees and REACHES into the water... two
of her fingers enter THE DRAIN.

We PUSH IN on Kellie's face... cross-cutting with a PUSH IN
on her fingers in the drain... something awful is about to
happen...

... but nothing does. Kellie pulls her hand out of the
water.

The tub remains full. The water sloshing from side to side.

INT. KELLIE'S BEDROOM - DUSK

Kellie sits at her desk -- using PLIERS to mash the metal of
the necklace chain back together.

We PUSH IN on the screen of her laptop -- she's been
googling Totems.

ONSCREEN -- an image of someone holding an object with some
kind of force radiating from it -- causing a spirit to

writhe in pain.

Done with the repair she heads to her bed and lays down --
gazing up at the necklace in her hands. Pondering her next
move.

Her eyes grow heavy, she tucks the necklace under her pillow
and settles in for a nap.

EXT. CALDWELL HOUSE - NIGHT

Dusk gives way to night.

INT. MASTER BATHROOM - NIGHT

We hear the shower running. Steam fills the air.
58.
We hear the squeak of the knobs as the shower is turned off.
James emerges and wraps himself in a towel.
Without noticing... he walks right past the bathroom mirror
as an unnatural condensation APPEARS.
INT. MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
James crawls into bed with Robin, who is already asleep.

As his eyes flutter shut... we hear a soft, raspy sound in
the air. Something unnatural.

The sound grows louder as we TILT UP to an AIR VENT above.

INT. KELLIE'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

ANGLE -- the AIR VENT in Kellie's room. Emitting the same
creepy sound. It's getting louder...

Kellie stirs awake. She reaches under her pillow for the
necklace... but can't find it.

Panicked -- she sits up in bed and lifts up the pillow. The
necklace is gone.

INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

James and Robin are fast asleep.

ANGLE -- the AIR VENT. The raspy sound grows stronger.

At the other end of the room -- behind Robin's SCULPTURES --
the CURTAINS start BLOWING. The vent going full throttle.

One of the sculptures starts to RATTLE and SWAY with the
force of the air.
INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

Kellie rushes over to Abby's room.

INT. ABBY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Kellie SHAKES Abby awake.

ABBY
What? What is it?
59.

KELLIE
My necklace. Have you seen it?
ANGLE -- the AIR VENT in Abby's room. The sound grows louder
still...
Abby takes in Kellie's intense glare -- starts to cry.
ABBY

She wanted it.

INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
ANGLE -- the AIR VENT. The raspy sound now fills the room.

Robin stirs awake and is immediately terrified. The
CHANDELIER sways dangerously overhead.

She SHAKES James.

ROBIN
Wake up! Wake up!

He bolts up in bed. 'What the fuck is going on?'

JAMES
Jesus Christ.
CLOSE -- the bookshelf across the room. The BOOKS start to
RATTLE.

INT. ABBY'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
The sound is now DEAFENING. Wind blows through their hair...
KELLIE
(almost yelling)
Where is it?

We hear Robin SCREAM.

INT. MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
Papers swirl through the air. SCULPTURES shatter.

Robin's eyes dart to the chandelier above her and James.
Swaying dangerously back and forth.

The WALLPAPER bubbles and moves -- suddenly something
UNDEFINED emerges -- taking the shape of the wallpaper
design. It is then reabsorbed in a FLASH.
60.

INT. ABBY’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
Kellie shakes Abby by the shoulders.
KELLIE
Where’s the necklace?
INT. MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
The chandelier pries loose from its moorings.

ROBIN
Look out!

SNAP! The chandelier FALLS. James and Robin jump out of the
way as it CRASHES down to the bed.

CERAMIC and GLASS SHATTER into a THOUSAND JAGGED FRAGMENTS.

INT. ABBY’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Abby scurries over to a SHELF FULL OF DOLLS and pulls the
necklace off the neck of an OLDER DOLL hidden in the middle.
She hands it to Kellie.

Kellie PULLS on either side of the necklace. SNAPPING it
into two pieces.

We hear a SHRIEK.

INT. MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
The WIND STOPS.

JAMES
What hell is going on?

Terrified -- Robin runs to the bathroom.

INT. ABBY’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Abby looks past Kellie...

A RATTLING inside her closet -- something in there is trying
to get out.
Abby -- sniffling and wiping tears from her cheeks -- gets

out of bed.
61.
ABBY
Mommy ?

Abby's eyes widen in FEAR. Kellie turns and steps towards
her.

KELLIE
What is it?

Abby SCREAMS as she's PULLED across the floor by her ankles
into the closet.

KELLIE (cont'd)
No!

Kellie grabs Abby’s wrist but falls back and SLAMS into her
bedside table.

She gets up and grabs Abby’s wrist again -- but whatever is
pulling on Abby is too strong.

James bursts into the room -- sees the terrifying
spectacle -- grabs Abby’s other wrist and PULLS her out of
the closet.

He scoops her up and carries her out of the room.

Kellie looks down at the broken necklace. Slack around her
arm.

It's gone. For now.

INT. MASTER BATHROOM - NIGHT

Robin turns on the sink and splashes water on her face.
She glances back in the mirror...

...She looks DEAD. PALE with PURPLE BRUISING, WET MATTED
HAIR. Swollen. Like she's been face down in the water for
two days.

The door SHAKES. Robin SCREAMS.

KELLIE (0.S8.)
It’s me!

She looks in the mirror again -- back to normal. ‘What the
hell?'

ROBIN
I'll be right out.
62.

KELLIE (0.S.)
You okay?

ROBIN
No.

KELLIE (0.S.)
Are you hurt?

ROBIN
I just need a second.

INT. HALLWAY - LATER

Kellie, James and Abby sit together in a spot with a good
vantage point.

James pulls out his cell.

JAMES
We need to get you guys out of
here.

Kellie grabs his hand.

KELLIE
You need to ask why this is
happening now. What's new here?

BEHIND THEM -- Robin appears. In shock. Cheeks stained with
tears.

KELLIE (cont'd)
I'm gonna pack a bag.
(to Abby)
You're coming with me. I'm not
letting you out of my sight.

INT. KELLIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Kellie opens the door and guides Abby -- scared and in
shock -- inside.

They don't see the SILHOUETTED FIGURE sitting on the bed

until... Kellie flicks on the LIGHTS.
She JUMPS BACK and gasps for breath... it's just Todd.
KELLIE

Jesus, Todd. Not a good time.
(MORE)
63.

KELLIE (cont'd)
(re: terrified Abby)
You need to learn how to read the
room a little bit, man.

TODD
I found something out...

He pulls out his iPhone.

KELLIE
Oh come on I know how to use
Google, Todd.

TODD
No no no. I took pictures at the
library. Look, a Totem is something
that meant a lot to a person while
they were alive...

ON TODD'S PHONE -- We SWIPE through photos he took of an OLD
BOOK -- illustrations of different TOTEMS. All shapes and
sizes. Some of them jewelry, some of them not.

TODD (cont'd)
.».. and now they're bound to it in
death.

ON TODD'S PHONE -- illustrations of bones being CRUSHED
alongside jewelry. A Funeral pyre with onlookers placing
Totems upon the flames etc...

TODD (cont'd)
It has to be touching a piece of
the person but... I think maybe we
can get rid of this thing.

Kellie covers Abby's ears.
KELLIE
Not in front of Abby. It's been a
rough night.
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

James opens the door and Bernard steps inside -- looks
everyone over.

Kellie, Robin and Todd are huddled in the living room.
Silent. Everyone is scared... except for Todd.
64.

JAMES
Thanks for coming. I just need you
to take the girls while I clean up
and I'll meet you at your place.

BERNARD
While you clean up?

TODD
I'm Todd, FYI.

BERNARD
That's nice.
(to James)
What the hell is going on here?

INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

Bernard surveys the damage from the middle of the room while
everyone else watches near the doorway.

BERNARD
Hold on a hot minute now. You guys
think a ghost is doing this?

JAMES
Something like that.
Bernard shrugs -- 'okaaaaayyyy.'
ROBIN

Maybe this is my fault. I mean I
encouraged her to talk to it...

KELLIE
For once I agree with you.

JAMES
Kellie, enough!

KELLIE
No. Not enough! You saw that thing
try to take Abby, right? It's
threatening my family. I'm not
going to just sit back!

BERNARD
(to Kellie)
So what’s it doing? Is there any
pattern to it?
65.

KELLIE
(stares at Robin)
It followed her here. Maybe it
wants to warn us.

ROBIN
(grits her teeth)
Abby thinks it's Lexy.

Bernard turns around to face James. Determined. No BS.

KELLIE
Not anymore, now she's scared of
it.

BERNARD

And you saw it too?

JAMES
I saw something, I think. I don't
know what it was.

BERNARD
And you don't leave immediately?
You have me come get the girls

while you do... what?
(looks James right in the
eye)

If you thought it wasn't her you
would have just driven them over

yourself.
(beat)
If my little girl is here, I want
to know.
Bernard sits on the bed. Quickly and urgently -- as if

staving off a fall.
Robin rushes to him.

ROBIN
Are you okay?

BERNARD
You guys can leave if you want. But
if there's any chance in hell it's
my daughter I'm staying.

Kellie looks around. Todd, Robin, James, Bernard... that's
it.

KELLIE
Wait. Where's Abby?
66.

Everyone looks around...

JAMES
Shit.

James peers into the hallway -- she's nowhere to be seen. He
heads out of the room.

JAMES (cont'd)
Abby!

Kellie turns to Robin.

KELLIE
See what you've done?

James steps back into the doorway.

ROBIN
I know you think it's my fault --

KELLIE
It's not just me. Do you really
think he’1l want anything to do
with you after this?

JAMES
Kellie, stop!

Kellie steps towards Robin.

KELLIE

I mean you knew my Mom but you
really liked my Dad.

(off Robin's look)
You think I didn't know that? You
don’t think after this we’re all
starting to wonder what you did to
take my Mom's place?

Bernard glances between Robin and Kellie.
KELLIE (cont'd)

I don't know why I had my bags
ready. The only one who should be

packing... is you.

JAMES
Jesus Christ, stop! Let’s just find
her!

KELLIE

(eyes still on Robin)
Fine by me.
67.

Kellie heads into the hallway. James and Todd follow.

Bernard stands up to join the search. Robin -- pulling
herself together -- sits him back down on the bed.

ROBIN
You should sit down. You don’t look
so good.

Bernard -- takes a puff from his inhaler -- nods and eyes
Robin suspiciously.

BERNARD
Go check on the girl. I’1ll be fine.

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

Kellie heads into the hallway.

Everyone follows... except for Bernard who lingers behind in
the Master Bedroom.

KELLIE
Abby!
(to everyone)
Check under all the beds.

Kellie pulls Todd aside.
KELLIE (cont'd)

(whispers)
We need to get rid of this thing.

TODD
We still need a piece of the
person.

KELLIE

Like a part of their body?

TODD
Yeah, that and the Totem have to be
destroyed together or it's no good.

KELLIE
We don't have that. Is there a
shortcut?

JAMES (0.S.)
(calls out)
Abby!
68.

KELLIE
Check her room. I'll be right back.

Todd dutifully heads into Abby's room.

INT. ABBY'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Todd opens the closet... nothing. He checks under the bed...
nothing.

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
James searches the room. Looks behind the curtains. Nothing.

JAMES
(to Robin)
Find her?

Robin looks around... pulls cushions from the couch.
Anything she can do.

ROBIN
Not yet.

She heads into the kitchen and out of sight. Kellie enters
and BUMPS into James. He's starting to panic.

JAMES
Where the hell is she?
(to Kellie)
I should have listened to you.

ROBIN (0.S.)
It's gonna be okay, James.

JAMES
(yelling)
Robin goddammit just help me find
her!

INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Robin’s searching the pantry when she hears this. She stands
up -- tears welling in her eyes.

She retreats through the back of the kitchen into the
hallway.
69.

INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Kellie leans in close to James.

KELLIE
Dad, if this thing took her, we're
not going to find her. Not like
this.

On James -- he can't accept it.
JAMES
She was terrified, maybe she's
hiding outside.

KELLIE
Maybe. Let's hope so.

James nods and heads out the front door as Kellie presses
on.

INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

Bernard bends down and checks under the bed... nothing.
He stands up -- suddenly gets dizzy. Short of breath, he
sits on the bed and pulls out his inhaler.
Kellie enters -- 'he doesn't look so good.'

KELLIE

You doing okay?
Bernard nods.

BERNARD
Just a lot to take in. You seem
awful sure this isn't her.
(beat)
Maybe you'd be jealous if it was.

KELLIE
Trust me. I was never jealous of
her.
Kellie looks down at her wrist -- the necklace TIGHTENS
around it. Whatever this is... it's coming back.
She peers out the door and down the empty hallway -- 'where

the hell is Robin?'
70.

INT. KELLIE'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Robin sits on Kellie's bed and buries her head in her

hands -- fighting back tears. On the verge of letting it all
out.

She straightens herself out a bit... looks around... she's
alone.

THEN...

She suddenly sees her shadow on the wall -- growing in

size -- illuminated by the light from a presence behind her.
She turns around -- a vapor begins to take shape under the

trophy shelf.

Then... a single trophy falls from the shelf. PLUNK. It
lands on the carpet.

World's Best Daughter. The LID POPS half off.
The vapor disappears.

Robin looks up to the shelf, then to the trophy on the
floor -- 'what the fuck?'

Robin bends down and picks it up. She reaches inside...

INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Kellie slowly makes her way to her room... the door open at
the end of the hall.

Her eyes dart around... keeping a lookout...

INT. KELLIE'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Kellie enters to find Robin sitting on the floor. In the
palm of her hand -- Lexy’s wedding ring.

INSERT -- an engraving inside the ring. ‘Lexy and James ~
August 9th 1998’

Kellie closes the door and slowly approaches her. Robin gets
up and backs away.

ROBIN
Why would you have this? Why would
you keep this from your Dad
unless --
71.

KELLIE
Just, relax. Okay?

ROBIN
She's been trying to tell us this
whole time.

KELLIE
Look, you don't know what it was
like. She and Dad weren't happy. He
needed someone stronger.

ROBIN
What? Like you?

KELLIE
Exactly like me.

Robin backs into the bathroom... Kellie follows.

INT. KELLIE'S BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

ANGLE -- the bathtub. Still full of water from earlier.
Kellie sees that Robin is looking past her... back into the
bedroom...

ROBIN

Stay away from me.
KELLIE
Don’t worry about Dad. He’s in the
right hands.
A GLOW fills the room... Kellie turns around...
A BRIGHT presence in the air...
A SHRIEK fills the room as the bright presence TURNS BLACK.

WIND fills the room.

Backing up... Robin trips and FALLS backwards into the tub.
SPLASH. She HITS her head on the faucet on the way down.
Unconscious... Robin's head bobs limply. BLOOD colors the
water.

Kellie steps forward -- places a single finger on Robin's
forehead -- and PUSHES her underwater.

We watch the BUBBLES stream out of Robin's nose... until

they stop.
72.

Kellie removes her finger... Robin floats. Absolutely still.
Kellie looks around. Lexy is gone. The wind has stopped.

She gets up and exits the bathroom. Robin’s profile surfaces
in the bathwater. Not breathing.

INT. KELLIE’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Kellie picks up the ‘World’s Best Daughter’ trophy and

places it back on the shelf.

INT. ABBY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Todd's growing impatient -- 'I can't just sit here.'
Todd reaches for the door -- but Kellie opens it first. She
enters the room... faking a panic.
KELLIE
Don't go out there. It killed
Robin.
TODD
Oh my God.
Kellie nods -- feigning sadness.

TODD (cont'd)
We have to get out of here.

Todd reaches for the window. Kellie rushes over to him and

places her hands on top of his -- stopping him.
KELLIE
Wait! Robin was trying to leave
too... when it got her. Let’s just

figure this out.

She paces the room... thinking. Then... she looks to the box
of Lexy's stuff on the bedside table.

KELLIE (cont'd)
What was that you were saying? Part
of the body?

She sits on the bed, opens the box and pulls out the LOCK OF
LEXY'S HAIR.

KELLIE (cont'd)
A piece of the person?
73.

She looks down at the box.

KELLIE (cont'd)
All I have to do is drop the
necklace in and...

TODD
... destroy it. At the same time.
She puts the hair back in the box -- closes it -- and looks
up to Todd.
KELLIE

I need her in front of me. I need
to see this work.

TODD
Don’t you mean ‘it?’ How do you
know it’s a woman?

Kellie sighs and looks up at him.

KELLIE
Because it’s my mother.
TODD
So that’s her necklace.
Kellie stares at the necklace -- quietly reliving the
memory.
KELLIE

I gave it to her the day before she
died. She was so happy when she got
it... she thought it meant we'd
stop fighting...

She places the box firmly in Todd’s hands

KELLIE (cont'd)
Hold on to this. Don’t let it out
of your sight.

TODD
Where are you going?

KELLIE
We need something that’1l make her
show herself.

Kellie heads into the hall and shuts the door behind her.
Todd sits back on the bed, the box in one hand and his phone
in the other.
74.

ON TODD'S PHONE -- an illustration of a necklace and a pile
of teeth burning together ina fire.
INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

Bernard -- still on the bed and short of breath -- HEARS
something. A faint RATTLING.

BAP. BAP. BAP.
He looks to the floor. A PANEL shifts slightly.

He stands up... bends down and finds a LATCH. He pulls the
panel up -- it's a CRAWL SPACE.

He sees Abby in the darkness below.

ABBY
Shhh!

BERNARD
What are you doing in there?

Bernard takes a pull from his inhaler.

ABBY
Kellie told me to hide.

BERNARD
What? Come on out.

Kellie enters the room.
KELLIE
Pull the panel shut, Abby. It's not
safe yet.

Abby's hand emerges from the hole and pulls the panel shut.

BERNARD
What the hell do you think you're
doing?
Wheezing heavily... he lifts the inhaler towards his mouth
Kellie gently reaches out and PRIES it from his hands.
KELLIE
Let me help you with that.
BERNARD
(gasping)

I always knew there was something
wrong with you.
75.

KELLIE

(fake panic)
Abby stay down there! The ghost is

hurting Bernard!

Bernard reaches out to grab his inhaler.

She takes a step back and presses the button, letting all
the vapor out... HISSSSS.

Bernard gasps for air... but it's not coming.

Bernard flops onto his belly and starts CRAWLING into the
hallway.

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
Kellie leisurely trails after Bernard as he crawls away.

BERNARD
Last thing she said to me... she
thought you liked your father a
little too much.

His breaths turn short and hiccup-y. He finally gives up and
rolls back over.

BERNARD (cont'd)
You always were a Daddy's girl.

KELLIE
I'm really sorry. This whole thing
got screwed up. But you have to
understand... I'm just trying to
keep everyone together.

Bernard looks up at her... his eyes wounded and betrayed as
he STOPS BREATHING.

She bends over and respectfully closes his eyes with her
fingers.
INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

Kellie heads back into the bedroom and pulls the crawl space
panel open.

ABBY
Did I do a good job?
76.

KELLIE
(smiles)
You did great.

She PULLS Abby out of the space and into the room.
KELLIE (cont'd)

I just needed to make sure you were
safe from the ghost.

ABBY
I didn't make a noise even when Dad
called.

KELLIE

Don't beat yourself up.
She gets parental and serious.
KELLIE (cont'd)
Remember, all Dad needs to know is
that you’re scared of this thing.
INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Kellie picks Abby up and steps over Bernard as they head
into the hall.

KELLIE
Don’t look down, okay? You don’t
need to see this.

Abby closes her eyes.

INT. ABBY’S ROOM - NIGHT

Kellie enters as Todd paces nervously -- dutifully holding
the box.

KELLIE
Look, I found Abby but my Dad will
be back any second. I need you to
keep him distracted while I get rid
of this thing.

She takes the box from him.

TODD
How?
77.

KELLIE
I don’t know. Just keep him
outside.

TODD
No.

KELLIE

What do you mean “no?”

TODD
We need to tell him it’s her. If
this thing killed Robin he needs to
know who it is.

KELLIE
Why are you doing this?

TODD
Because it’s the right thing to do.
You don’t have anything to hide.
Todd reaches for the door. Kellie BLOCKS him.
TODD (cont'd)
You think I’1l always just do what
you say, don’t you?
On Kellie -- sad but determined.

KELLIE
That’s what you’re here for.

Kellie PULLS Todd in for a kiss.
KELLIE (cont'd)

(whispers)
So people don’t ask questions about

me.
Todd accepts the kiss .. he’s been waiting for so long for
this moment... but a second after their lips connect his

eyes widen. BULGING.

He pulls away in pain. We pull around to reveal the THREE-
PRONGED GARDEN TROWEL embedded in his back.

KELLIE (cont'd)
I really like you Todd. But we
could never be together. I belong
to someone else.

She pulls the trowel out of Todd’s back... and advances
towards him.
78.

INT. KELLIE'S BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

Robin floats in the bath -- her face breaking the water. Not
moving.

TAP. A drop of water falls from the shower head and lands on
her forehead.

TAP. Another one.

We hear a small underwater POP... the tub finally starts to
drain.

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

The front door opens and James steps inside. Kellie exits
Abby's room and RUSHES into his arms.

KELLIE
Thank God you’re back!

James looks down and sees Abby.

Kellie pulls away from him as he kneels down and puts his
arms on Abby’s shoulders.

JAMES
Where the hell were you?
KELLIE
We need to get out of here right

now.

James looks past Kellie into the hallway and sees Bernard on
the floor.

JAMES
Oh my God, Bernard!

INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

James tentatively approaches Bernard's body -- still several
meters away.

Kellie jumps in front of James -- blocking his progress.
Right in front of Abby's open door.

KELLIE
This thing got everyone. If we stay
any longer we --
79.

JAMES
Where... where’s Robin?

KELLIE
Dad, let’s go.

JAMES
(shouting)
Robin!
He opens his mouth to call out again but stops once he
turns... and sees Todd's BODY in Abby's room.

INT. ABBY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

James enters and kneels beside Todd. He looks up at Kellie.

JAMES
You're telling me this thing... did
this?

ABBY

That’s why Kellie told me to hide
in the crawl space.

KELLIE
Abby!

Confused, James looks from Abby to Kellie.

JAMES
Wait... you told her to hide?
KELLIE
I didn’t want it to know where she
was.
JAMES

Why not just get her out of the
house like I asked?

James sees Abby in the doorway gazing at Todd’s corpse.
JAMES (cont'd)
(to Abby)
Don’t come in here.

James rises to his feet -- stares Kellie square in the eye.

JAMES (cont'd)
Where is she?
80.

On Kellie -- she can’t come up with an answer. She sees
James’ face fall as he takes a step away from her.

KELLIE
Why are you looking at me like
that?
James -- speechless -- pushes past her on his way to the

door.

Kellie GRABS his arm but James PULLS AWAY.

Desperate -- Kellie grabs a SNOW GLOBE from Abby's dresser
SMASHES James in the head with it. GLASS and WATER fly
through the air.

James hits the ground -- out cold.

FADE TO:

INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER

James wakes up in a haze. Everything’s blurry. He STRUGGLES
to stand up.

REVEAL -- James is tied to a chair.

The box is on the floor. Kellie DOUSES it with LIGHTER
FLUID.

KELLIE
(muttering to herself)
Come on, Mom. You’ve been showing
up every five fucking minutes.
Where are you when we really need

you?
Abby sits in the corner -- scared but dutifully holding a
CHARCOAL LIGHTER.
JAMES
(groggy )

Why would you...
(sees the lighter fluid)
What are you doing?

KELLIE
Oh, you’re awake.
(re: the box)
I’m making us safe again.
(off his look)
Don’t worry, I'll be careful.
81.

JAMES
It’s her, isn’t it?

Kellie sighs and nods reluctantly -- ‘yes.’

JAMES (cont'd)
She knew we’d be in danger when
Robin moved in. From you.

KELLIE
That's ridiculous. I wouldn't hurt
you. I protected you. I’ve been
protecting you for years. I got rid
of the drama. I got rid of the
yelling. Think about how much
happier we all were once she...
left.

JAMES
You killed her.

KELLIE
I pushed her. Gravity did the rest.

She catches James looking at the necklace wrapped around her
forearm. The bruises. The blood.

KELLIE (cont'd)
I’m sorry, I didn’t want you to
know it was her.

James breaks down in tears.

KELLIE (cont'd)
Don't be sad! This is totally
fixable! We'll go back to the way
it was. Just us. You, me and Abby.
No Mom, no Robin...
(genuine)
Weren't the past five years great?

JAMES
(calls out)
Robin! Robin!

INT. KELLIE'S BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

The last of the water has drained from the tub. Robin lays
soaking on the bare porcelain.
82.

INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Kellie grabs the lighter from Abby.

KELLIE
(to James)
What is it you don’t understand! We
don’t need her.

JAMES
(calls out again)
Robin!
KELLIE

She can’t hear you.

Kellie’s ready to torch the box. Her eyes scan the room for
any sign of Lexy as she CLICKS the lighter.

JAMES
Why don’t we stop and figure this
out together?

KELLIE
Where have I heard that before?

JAMES
Please. Let me fix this.

KELLIE
No. You’re not good at that.
Without me, Mom would have
destroyed this family years ago.

Kellie grabs Abby’s hand and pulls her close.

KELLIE (cont'd)
(to Abby)
I need you to cry out for her. Cry
out for Mom.

ABBY
But what if she’s listening to you
now? She knows what you’re doing.
Kellie closes her eyes and sighs -- ‘goddammit.’

KELLIE
You're right.

Kellie pulls the necklace off her arm and WRAPS IT AROUND
ABBY'S NECK.
83.

KELLIE (cont'd)
Let’s see if she cares about you as
much as I do.

Kellie sees James’ eyes widen as he looks past her.
Something’s behind her.

Kellie releases Abby and turns to see... Robin. Soaking wet.
Bloodshot eyes. Pissed off.

ROBIN
It’s over, Kellie.

Kellie DIVES for the box. Robin quickly approaches and
SNATCHES it out of her hands.

Kellie jumps to her feet.

KELLIE
No! Don’t!

Robin lets the box fall to the floor and STOMPS on it. The
BOX SHATTERS.

ROBIN
I’m so sick of you. Talking about
how you protect them.

Kellie crawls on her knees -- grabbing the lock of hair and
trying to get as many pieces of the box as she can.

ROBIN (cont'd)
You don’t give a shit about
protecting them. You want to
possess them.

Kellie gets back on her feet and takes a step towards Abby.
KELLIE
(fuming)
That is not true.

ROBIN
Abby, come here.

Abby takes a step away from Kellie towards Robin.
KELLIE
(hurt )
Abby... seriously?

Abby pauses and looks at Kellie.
84.

JAMES
Abby, listen to Robin.

Kellie -- utterly lost -- looks to James.

JAMES (cont'd)
We're going to get you some help,
Kellie.

Confused -- she takes a step towards him.

JAMES (cont'd)
You’re not well.

Kellie takes another step.

KELLIE
(realizing)
We're not going to be together
anymore?
(smiles)
You don’t mean that.

JAMES
(a burst of emotion)
You destroyed everything!

Kellie LEAPS onto James -- still tied to the chair -- and
wraps her arms TIGHT around him.

Manic. Flailing. The first time we’ve seen her totally out
of control.

KELLIE
No, I’ve done everything! I made
this family! You can’t take it away
from me!

The room starts to shake ever so slightly. Kellie hangs on
to him for dear life.

She pulls him TIGHTER. He can’t breathe. Her arms slip
and -- almost subconsciously -- wrap around his neck.

ROBIN
Kellie, stop!

The necklace once again DIGS into Kellie’s wrist. The room
SHAKES violently now.

Robin GRABS HOLD of Kellie’s arm.

Kellie refuses to let go. James struggles but she’s
smothering him. The chair LEANS back on its rear legs.
85.

WIND fills the room. DEBRIS FLIES through the air.

The chair TOPPLES over -- sending Kellie flying to the
floor. The shelf next to them COLLAPSES. FRAMED PICTURES of
the family fall onto Kellie. GLASS SHATTERS all over her.

A loud CRACKING BOOM.

LEXY APPEARS in specter form and hovers menacingly above the
family.

James’ eyes widen in terror.
That awful supernatural SHRIEK pierces the air.

Another BOOMING SOUND... LEXY floats in front of them.
Vaporous, ethereal and unmistakably her.

She’s surrounded by a HAZE OF ENERGY.

James’ eyes fill with tears, relief and closure. Robin
comforts Abby as the little girl looks up in wonder.

Kellie averts her eyes in anger and shame -- she can’t even
look at her.

Lexy turns to vapor and MOVES THROUGH JAMES -- a radiant
stream -- disappearing as she does so.

Kellie turns to see Robin clutching Abby. Protecting her.
Kellie grabs a SHARD OF GLASS from one of the shattered
frames and runs after Robin -- forcing her into the hallway.
INT. KELLIE'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Robin SLAMS the door and backs up against the wall.

INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Kellie KICKS at the door.

INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Abby unties James from the chair.

INT. KELLIE’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Kellie KICKS the door open and slowly enters the room -- her
eyes searching in the dark.
86.
ROBIN
Kellie... your hand.
Kellie looks down at the blood dripping from her hand.
Kellie RACES towards her -- the shard of glass raised high.

Robin BACKS UP and SLAMS into the trophy shelf. TROPHIES
TOPPLE to the ground.

JAMES (0.C.)

Just stop!
Kellie spins around -- surprised to see James in the
doorway.
KELLIE
Dad?
She looks him in the eye... almost pleading.

KELLIE (cont'd)
You replaced me.

Kellie once again LUNGES at Robin and TRIPS over the
‘World’s Best Daughter’ trophy and FALLS face first towards
the razor sharp sculpture in the corner.

Robin reaches out to stop her.

ROBIN
No no no!

CLOSE on Robin's face. A sickening SHHHK as Kellie's SCREAMS
fill the air.

James rushes over to help Kellie -- but we know by the look
on his face it’s too late.

He crumples to his knees, sobbing.

TIGHT ON Kellie’s face. Wide-eyed shock and terror.

THE CAMERA SPINS AROUND to the MIRROR opposite her. We
realize she’s staring at her own reflection -- she watches

as the color drains from her own face.

cur TO:

EXT. CALDWELL HOUSE - MORNING

POLICES CARS and AMBULANCES clutter the driveway.
87.

EMTs attend to Robin, James and Abby. All wrapped in
blankets.
INT. KELLIE'S BEDROOM - MORNING

Kellie is covered by a WHITE SHEET. Blood seeping through
the center.

Impaled on the sculpture she hated so much.

The sheet covers her almost entirely but stops at her eyes.
They are lifeless and wide with fear.

EXT. SAN FRANCISCO APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
An affluent ocean front building.

TITLE - One Year Later

INT. NEW APARTMENT - MAIN BEDROOM - NIGHT

James and Robin sleep in their new bed. A PHOTO their
wedding day on the nightstand.

WHISPERS offscreen -- Robin stirs.

INT. NEW APARTMENT - HALLWAY - NIGHT

Robin makes her way down the hall. Tired. In her nightgown.
She stops outside a closed door.

The whispering is LOUDER.

INT. NEW APARTMENT - ABBY’S ROOM - NIGHT

Robin opens the door -- startling Abby.
ROBIN
You know the rules. Real friends
only.
ABBY

I wasn’t talking to anyone.

Lexy’s necklace dangles at her clavicle.
88.
ROBIN
Come on.

ABBY
I’m serious. You’re too paranoid.

ROBIN
No such thing.
INT. NEW APARTMENT - HALLWAY - NIGHT

Robin closes the door and heads back down the hall.

INT. NEW APARTMENT - MAIN BEDROOM - NIGHT
James wakes up and spoons Robin as she gets back into bed.

JAMES
Everything alright?

Robin smiles.
ROBIN
We've gotta keep an eye on that
one.
INT. NEW APARTMENT - ABBY’S ROOM - NIGHT
Abby lays on her stomach, drifting off to sleep.

ABBY
Can you do it one more time?

Beat. She smiles.
ABBY (cont'd)
Thanks!
(sings)
The itsy-bitsy spider went up the
water spout...

INVISIBLE FINGERS walk up her back as she sings along,
pressing into her pajamas.

We pan over to Lexy’s wedding ring on the bedside table.

cur TO BLACK:

THE END.
