HALF TO DEATH

by
Scott Lobdell and Christopher Landon
DARKNESS.

We HEAR the strange, hollow cry of a BELL ringing in
reverse. The warbled sound grows louder and louder until
we...

FADE IN:
EXT. HOSPITAL BELL TOWER -- POTSDAM UNIVERSITY - MORNING

The morning sunlight gleams off the great IRON CAST BELL
as it continues ringing, but at its normal speed.

From this high up we can see how isolated the school is --
surrounded on one side by thick forest.

A small campus, mostly brick and ivy. In the Quad, a
fraction of the students amble to their classes.

We glimpse the highlights: THE FOOTBALL FIELD. SORORITY
ROW. AN ADMINISTRATIVE BUILDING. THE DORMS.

INT. CARTER’S DORM ROOM - MORNING

A boxed shrine to hip. From the “BLADE RUNNER” and
vintage “STAR WARS” posters to the book shelf lined with
plastic-sealed comics.

Tangled in black skull and crossbone sheets, we find
TERESA “Tree” GELBMAN, 19, beautiful.

Outside, the bell tolls one final time before a calm
settles over the room. The quiet doesn’t last long as
Tree’s CELL PHONE plays “Happy Birthday”.

Tree stirs through the fog of her hang-over, searching
for her phone. As she sits up, several things hit her at
once: she’s not in her room, she's wearing a guy's T-
shirt, and the guy it probably belongs to is bent down,
putting something away under the couch.

CARTER DAVIS, 19, good looks hidden behind grunge and
stubble, turns around and smiles at Tree.

CARTER
You’re up. I wasn’t --
TREE
(interrupting)

Where are my clothes?
CARTER
On the night stand.

Tree fishes her phone out -- 1 missed call from “DAD”.
She snaps it shut with an exasperated sigh.

Tree pulls off the T-shirt, exposing a black lace bra.
Carter quickly turns his back to her.

CARTER (CONT’D)

I don’t know if you remember my
name. You were pretty wasted last
night. I’m Car--

TREE
Tylenol?

CARTER
What?

TREE

My head’s killing me. Do you have
any Tylenol?

CARTER
Uh, sure. Hold on a sec.

He starts rummaging through the debris of his room while
Tree finishes getting dressed. Carter finds a bottle of

aspirin in a TOILETRY BAG that was hidden under a pair of
jeans. He offers her a pill. She snatches the bottle and
dumps three in her hand and dry-swallows them like a pro.

CARTER (CONT'D)
I’m Carter.

TREE
(interrupting again)
Not a word of this to anyone. Got
it?

CARTER
Sure...

Tree starts to leave. The door is covered in a collage of
band stickers and other bits and strips of randomness. In
the middle of it all is a BUMPER STICKER that proclaims:
“TODAY IS THE FIRST DAY OF THE REST OF YOUR LIFE”

Tree opens the door and collides with a lanky FRESHMAN.
The words are already leaving his mouth:
FRESHMAN
Dude! Did you hit that fine-vagine
or what?!

He meets Tree’s hard stare and instantly shrinks. Tree
pushes past him.

Carter shoots the freshman a look.

CARTER
Nice one, dickweed.

Carter’s eyes fall on Tree’s GOLD BRACELET, lying on the
floor, as it catches the light from the open window. She
must have knocked it off the night stand in her haste.

EXT. THE CAMPUS - MORNING

Dressed in a slinky outfit and heels, Tree is forced to
make the “walk of shame” across the already bustling
campus. She shields her eyes from the blinding sunlight.

She passes a female STUDENT who thrusts a petition at
her.

STUDENT PROTESTER
Stop global warming!

Tree doesn’t deign to acknowledge the proffered
clipboard.

A nearby CAR ALARM goes off.

Next, Tree notices a PAIR OF STUDENTS studying on the
lawn as the sprinklers suddenly go off -- they’re getting
soaked as they scramble to protect their books.

On the left, TREE passes a group of FRAT PLEDGES singing
loudly. THE FRAT BROTHER stands beside a sign: “26th
Straight Hour”.

FRAT PLEDGES
-- not a Willie or a Sam! I’m the
eighth ole’ man named Henry!
Henry the Eighth, I am!

FRAT BROTHER
Second verse, same as the first!
FRAT PLEDGES
Oh, Henry the Eighth, I am, I
am!...

The crowd of onlookers cheer as one EXHAUSTED FRAT PLEDGE
passes out, hitting his head hard on the pavement.

Tree reaches the end of the quad and starts down the
steps, as KEITH LUMBLY (18, a big-boned mouthbreather) is
just lumbering up the steps.

KEITH
Morning Tree!

She genuinely doesn’t see him... He sighs.

The end of the steps lead to SORORITY ROW. Tree’s house,
KAPPA DELTA is a converted Mansion at the edge of the
park.

INT. KAPPA DELTA HOUSE - MORNING

Tree creeps into the house -- trying to avoid any of her
sisters. She’s got one foot on the stairs when:

DANIELLE (0.C.)
Oh-my-god. You sneaky beeyotch!

Busted. Tree turns around to face DANIELLE BOUSEMAN, 20,
peroxide-pretty.

DANIELLLE
Who was it?

TREE
Nobody.

DANIELLLE

Sisters don’t keep secrets.

TREE
Seriously. It was nobody.

DANIELLLE
Well, I hope nobody used a condom.
We don’t want somebody getting
chlamydia.

TREE
Thanks for that, Danielle. Really,
so thoughtful.
DANIELLE
What are sisters for?

Tree starts up the stairs.

DANIELLLE
(calling after her)
Don’t forget! House meeting at
lunch!

TREE
Living for it!

INT. TREE’S BEDROOM - MORNING

Tree has changed into new clothes and is running a brush
through her tangled bed-head when her roommate, LORI
SPENGLER (18, a cherubic faced redhead) steps from the
bathroom, wet, wrapped in a towel.

LORI
She finally rolls in.

Shoving a pile of “rejected outfits” off her bed, Tree
curls up with her childhood stuffed animal.

TREE
Did I totally embarrass myself
last night?

LORI
Not at all. Unless you consider
dancing on a table, starting two
fights, and barfing pretzel chunks
all over the bar embarrassing.

TREE
Please tell me you’re kidding...

LORI
Oh, and you rammed your tongue
down Nick Sims’ throat right in
front of Danielle.

TREE
Get out!

LORI
For shizzle.
TREE
But she was so nice to me this
morning?

LORI

I think she was as drunk as you
last night. Consider it collective
amnesia.

TREE
Thank god for that.

Tree looks at the clock.

TREE (CONT'D)
Crap! I’m so late for class!

Tree starts putting her backpack together. Her side of
the room is a giant mess -- clothes, make-up, and trash
strewn everywhere.

TREE (CONT'D)
I can’t find my damn book!

LORI
Maybe if you cleaned your side of
the room, you could actually find
something.

TREE
Just cause I’m not an OCD freak --
(finding her book)
Ha!

The TEXT BOOK is under a pile of mail on her desk. (Note:
there’s a BLACK ENVELOPE on top of the pile but Tree pays
it no attention.)

Lori clears her throat behind Tree -- Tree turns around
and discovers her roommate holding a CUPCAKE with a
single, burning candle.

LORI
Did you really think you could
keep it a secret from me?

TREE
How did you find out?
LORI
Driver’s license. Not the best
picture of you, I might add.

TREE
I assume you changed my ringer
too?

LORI

(sly)
Who me? Never.

Tree reluctantly takes the cupcake. Closing her eyes, she
makes a wish and blows the candle out.

LORI (CONT'D)
What’d you wish for?

TREE
A new roommate.

LORI
(laughing)
Wench.

And without a second thought, Tree dumps the cupcake into
the trash.

LORI (CONT'D)
Hey!

TREE
Sorry. Too many carbs.

Lori looks a little hurt. Tree grabs her bag.

TREE (CONT'D)
Toodles.

LORI
Well, you’re welcome...

Tree’s already out the door.

Lori shakes her head: Tree thoughtlessly left the door
open with Lori still standing there in the towel.

LORI (CONT'D)
Hello? Towel here -- !
INT. DR. BUTLER’S SCIENCE CLASS - MORNING

Tree “sneaks” into the rear of the lecture hall. DR.
GREGORY BUTLER (early 30’s, chiseled) jots notes on the
chalkboard.

GREGORY
When extreme agitation occurs,
locomotive response in the
subjects show an acceleration
across the quantum plane, where --

A quiet entrance is ruined by a very loud, squeaky door
as Tree slinks into the room. As she takes a seat in the
back she makes eye-contact with her professor.

Was that a sneer or a smirk he just flashed her?
EXT. LUNCH PATIO - AFTERNOON

A group of Kappa girls have gathered around a table, as
Danielle conducts a house meeting with the intensity of a
U.N. assembly. To her right, MONICA KEENER, 18, a nervous
pledge, diligently takes notes on a legal pad.

The other girls, including Tree, absently suck on sugar-
free, no whip Mochas OR what they call...lunch.

Visibly absent is Lori.

DANIELLE
-- and we still need to pick this
year’s charity. I can say right
now, there is no way we're doing
the Special Needs art fair again.
All those tards want to do is hug.
Totally freaked my shit out.
Thoughts?

Another pledge, BECKY SHEPARD, 18, a little chunky but
doing her best to fit-in, joins the group with her tray.
All eyes fall on her food...a sandwich with a side of
pasta salad, and a tall glass of chocolate milk.

Feeling the weight of their collective stares:

BECKY
What’s wrong?

DANIELLE
I don’t know. What’s wrong Tree?
TREE
Nothing. Except for the buffet you
just dumped on our table.

DANIELLE
And is that chocolate milk I see?

Becky looks horrified.
BECKY
(ashamed)
I missed breakfast.
She gets up with her tray and SLAMS into Carter. The
chocolate milk slides off the tray and SPLASHES all over
Tree. Danielle cracks up.

TREE
Ass--

She looks up and sees who it is.

TREE (CONT'D)
--hole.

Carter grabs some napkins from the dispenser on the
table.

CARTER
I’m so sorry, Tree.
DANIELLE
You two know each other?
CARTER TREE
Yes. No.
They look at each other -- Tree’s eyes could burn holes

through him. Carter remembers her threat earlier.

CARTER
(sheepish)
We...had a class together last
year.

Tree snatches the napkins from him and starts wiping
herself down.

CARTER (CONT’D)
I just came by to return this.
10.

He offers Tree her bracelet.

CARTER (CONT’D)
I didn’t know where you lived--

Tree snatches it back and looks around to see if anybody
saw the exchange. Luckily, they didn’t.

He waits for a “thank you”.

TREE
Help you?

Carter’s hurt turns to indignation. But he doesn’t bark
at her. He’s better than that.

CARTER
Sorry again about the mess.

Carter walks off.

DANIELLE
What a douche-bag.

INT. CAMPUS BOOK STORE - AFTERNOON

Tree, a BLUE WORK SMOCK over the CHOCOLATE MILK STAIN on
her blouse thumbs through a copy of US Weekly. Her boss,
LEONARD GILBERT, 40's, wormy, peers over her shoulder.

LEONARD
Teresa, I believe you’re supposed
to be unpacking the new shipment,
not reading about--
(reading the cover)
--Brangelina.

TREE
I’m still on my ten.

LEONARD
Your ten ended ten minutes ago,
missy.

Tree drops the magazine. As she heads toward the back,
she passes a display of school-spirit paraphernalia
including a stack of eerie MASKS (the school mascot).
11.

INT. STOCK ROOM - AFTERNOON

Fluorescent lights HUM in the sterile room as we find
Tree hunched over a pile of text books, stamping the
covers with STICKERS that say “REDUCED”.

Immersed in the mind-blowing monotony of her job, Tree
doesn’t see the HULKING FIGURE standing behind her.

We SEE a BOX CUTTER in his dirty hand as the blade slowly
slides out...

The figure leans in and SLASHES!--

--the plastic band wrapped around a pile of books next to
Tree. She jumps!

ANGLE ON

Keith (the mouthbreather from before) standing behind
Tree.

TREE
Don’t sneak up on me, Keith. It’s
creepy.

KEITH

Leonard wants to know if the books
are ready.

Tree picks up a stack and shoves them into Keith’s arms.
But he doesn’t move. He just stands there like a lug,
holding the stack.

TREE
Anything else, Keith?

KEITH
Um...I was wondering what you were
doing this Friday night?

TREE
Are you asking me on a date,
Keith?
His cheeks turn red.
KEITH

Well...sorta...
12.

Tree raises the gun and STAMPS Keith’s forehead with a
“REDUCED” sticker.

TREE
Sorry, I’m busy.

INT. CAMPUS HOSPITAL - AFTERNOON

Tree enters the lobby. Her cell phone plays “Happy
Birthday”. Tree checks the LCD: INCOMING CALL FROM DAD.

She instantly hits the IGNORE button as she stops in
front of the elevators. The doors open -- LORI steps out,
wearing her NURSING SCRUBS.

TREE
(surprised)
Lori...
LORI
Hi.

She steps out. The doors close as Tree struggles with the
stilted air between them.

TREE
So, I thought you only work
nights.

LORI
I’m doing a double for Jen. She
has the flu.

TREE
We missed you at the meeting
today.

LORI

I didn’t think I needed to be
there to decide what color
Danielle’s hair should be this
season.

Tree laughs.
LORI (CONT'D)
I guess I don’t have to ask what
you're doing here.

The levity between them dissolves instantly.
13.

TREE
Gotta go.

Nudging past Lori, Tree presses elevator button.

LORI
Look, Tree...it’s none of my
business but I think eventually
something like that is bound to
have some pretty serious
consequences.

The doors open. Tree steps inside.

TREE
You're right. It’s none of your
business.
The metal doors shut -- Lori’s disconcerted expression

reflected in the polished surface.
INT. 4TH FLOOR -- HOSPITAL - AFTERNOON

Tree exits the elevator and discreetly slips past the
nurse’s station and disappears behind a door marked “DR.
GREGORY BUTLER”

As the door closes, we SEE a POLICE OFFICER stationed
outside a door at the far end of the hall.

INT. GREGORY'S OFFICE - AFTERNOON

Tree pushes open the door of this small cramped office
and realizes she’s alone for a moment.

She notices a wedding picture of a happy bride and groom.
She smirks, places it face side down on the desk.

Gregory (Professor Butler) enters his office, closing the
door behind him.

GREGORY
We can’t do this. There’s too
much going on in the building
today.

TREE
Okay. I'’11 go.

She takes his CAR KEYS out of his hand and dumps them in
his desk drawer.
14.

GREGORY
I have patients...

TREE
Yeah, and I’m losing mine.

ZIP! She has her hands down his pants, kissing him hard.
GREGORY
(between kisses)
This doesn’t mean you’re passing
my course.

TREE
Do I look like I care?

They start kissing passionately -- Tree accidentally
kicks the desk chair across the room. It wedges itself
between the door and a file cabinet.

Which is perfect, as, suddenly... SOMEONE OUTSIDE opens
the door and tries to enter, but it is jammed.

STEPHANIE
Gregory? Are you there?

In what seems like an instant later...

... Gregory and a completely dressed Tree open the door
for STEPHANIE BUTLER (pretty, fragile) Gregory’s wife.

GREGORY
Hey, Sweetie --

He gives Stephanie a kiss.

GREGORY (CONT’D)
-- just wrapping up here.

Tree squeezes past Stephanie and forces a smile -- which
isn’t returned.

As Gregory closes the door, Stephanie glances back at
Tree, who wonders if Stephanie suspects anything.

INT. TREE’S BEDROOM - EVENING

Tree sits on her bed, painting her toenails while a “Road
Rules” marathon runs for the umpteenth time on MTV.

There’s a light knock at the door.
TREE
Enter...

Danielle walks in, all dolled-up. Tree sizes
furrowed.

TREE (CONT'D)
Is that my top?

DANIELLE
How cute is it on me?
TREE
Just don’t get anything on it,
please.
DANIELLE
You mean like Nick’s jizz?
TREE
Wow. Classy.
DANIELLE

(ignoring her)
What time are you going to the
party tonight?

TREE
I don’t know...later.

Tree goes back to painting her nails.

Just then, there is a BLACK OUT. It is 9:23.

DANIELLE
Our tuition dollars at work.

A moment later, the lights go back on.

DANIELLE (CONT’D)
Anyhoo...don’t be too late or all
the cute Sigma boys will be taken.

Danielle leaves.

Looking down, Tree notices she messed up one
in the blackout. Tree growls. As she reaches
the bottle of POLISH REMOVER, she spills the
of RED NAIL POLISH on her bedspread.

15.

her up, brow

of her toes
over to grab
open bottle
16.

TREE
Damn it!

Tree jumps up and grabs a crumpled towel hanging over her
desk chair. But something makes her freeze...

A PHOTOGRAPH...

Peeking out beneath her unopened mail (and the BLACK
CARD).

She picks up the photo. We SEE Tree, dressed in her high
school cap and gown, framed between her proud FATHER and
MOTHER (Tree looks just like her).

The image cuts right to Tree’s heart -- so Tree does the
only thing she knows, she hides the photo in the top
drawer of the dresser. Out of sight, out of mind.

EXT. THE THOROUGHFARE - NIGHT

Tree, in a resplendent white cotton dress, leaves her
house and looks around. The area is completely empty of
people. Most everyone at their respective pledge houses.

Tree checks her VOICE MAIL as she walks at a brisk clip.

GREGORY
(on the phone)
Hey, it's me. I'll text you later
about meeting tonight. Not sure if
I can get away but I'll do my
best. By the way, that was close
this afternoon. But kinda hot.

Tree laughs.
SAVE -- NEXT MESSAGE...
ALAN
(pissed)
Tree, it's dad. I sat in that
restaurant waiting for you for
almost an hour --
DELETE. Tree snaps her phone shut.

At the path she comes upon a blocked off area.

She glances at her watch. 10:43.
17.

TREE
Shit.

The lights are off along the cordoned and torn up path.
But it is the shortest way to the Quad.

Tree steps around the wooden barriers...

EXT. THE PATH - NIGHT

Tree walks along the path, suddenly aware of... what?
Something? Someone?

TREE
Hello?

She comes across a large ditch exposing a water pipe.
She realizes she has to edge around, towards the trees.

Taking a deep breath, convinced she is alone, she edges
her way along the ditch. Her back to the trees.

Which is when a hand reaches out from the shadows and
grabs her around the mouth!

Her muffled screams are cut short when she’s suddenly
aware of the KNIFE that erupts from her chest! Before
she can make sense of it...
She’s tossed in the ditch...

..-where her rapidly draining blood mixes with the water
and mud. She stares wide-eyed at an uncaring universe.

Then she is dead.

SLAM CUT:
INT. CARTER’S DORM ROOM - MORNING
Tree bolts awake -- realizing it was just a nightmare,
she inhales deeply with relief. In the background we HEAR
the bell toll the hour. Suddenly her cell phone
rings...”Happy Birthday” plays.

Sitting up, Tree finds Carter bent over, putting
something away beneath the sofa. He turns around, smiles.

CARTER
You’re up. I wasn’t --
18.

TREE
(interrupting)
My clothes?
CARTER

Uh...on the night stand.

Tree fishes her phone out of her jeans -- 1 missed call
from “DAD”. She snaps the phone shut.

Tree starts changing into her clothes. Carter turns
around.

CARTER (CONT’D)

I don’t know if you remember my
name. You were pretty wasted last
night. I’m Car--

TREE
(interrupting)
Carter.

He smiles, pleasantly surprised.

TREE (CONT'D)
Tylenol?

CARTER
What?

TREE
My head’s killing me. Do you have
any Tylenol?

CARTER
Uh, sure. Hold on a sec.

Carter begins searching. Tree grows inpatient and grabs
his TOILETRY BAG under some clothes. She finds the bottle
and dumps the pills in her hand.

CARTER (CONT’D)
(laughing)
Wow. Have you been here before?

The question makes Tree pause. How did she know where the
aspirin was?

CARTER (CONT’D)
You okay?
19.

Tree is still thinking.

CARTER (CONT'D)
Tree?

She turns and looks at his door -- there’s the sticker:
“TODAY IS THE FIRST DAY OF THE REST OF YOUR LIFE”

Suddenly, the door opens. Enter lanky freshman...
FRESHMAN
Dude! Did you hit that fine-vagine

or what?!

He immediately shrinks at the sight of her. A little
freaked, Tree pushes past him and hurries out.

Carter shoots the freshman a look.

CARTER
Nice one, dickweed.

EXT. THE CAMPUS - MORNING

Shielding her eyes from the glaring sun, Tree makes the
“walk of shame” again. But it’s all so familiar.

She passes the student protester.

STUDENT PROTESTER
Stop global warming!

The CAR ALARM goes off...
Then the sprinklers, soaking the studying pair.
The frat pledges...
FRAT PLEDGES
-- not a Willie or a Sam! I’m the
eighth ole’ man named Henry!

Henry the Eighth, I am!

FRAT BROTHER
Second verse, same as the first!

FRAT PLEDGES
Oh, Henry the Eighth, I am, I
am!...

Keith, waiting for Tree at the steps...
20.

KEITH
Morning Tree.

This time, she notices him.

TREE
Keith, what day is it?
KEITH
Tuesday, the eighteenth.
TREE
Are you sure?
KEITH

Says so right here on my watch.

He offers his wrist but Tree turns and looks back. The
whole world looks a little off kilter to her.

INT. KAPPA DELTA HOUSE - MORNING

Tree doesn’t sneak in this time. But as she starts up the
stairs...

DANIELLE
Oh-my-god. You sneaky beeyotch!

Tree turns around, clearly on edge.

DANIELLE (CONT’D)
Who was it?
(off Tree’s blank
stare/offended)
Sisters don’t keep secrets.

TREE
No, I’m totally having deja vu
right now.

DANIELLE
I have it all the time. It’s
supposed to mean somebody’s like
walking over your grave or
something.

TREE
Seriously. I’ve had it all
morning. It’s crazy.
21.

DANIELLE
Maybe you should switch to water
next time, hon. You’re so Tara
Reid when you drink.

TREE
Thanks. I’1l keep that in mind.

DANIELLE
What are sisters for?

Tree starts up the stairs.

DANIELLE (CONT’D)
(calling after her)

Don’t forget! House meeting at

lunch!

Tree stops again, turns around. Danielle misinterprets
the confused look in her eyes.

DANIELLE (CONT’D)
It’s been on the schedule board
since last Thursday, Tree.

TREE
Yeah...I remember.

The problem is she remembers everything.
INT. TREE’S BEDROOM - MORNING

Tree is changing when Lori steps from the bathroom,
wrapped in a towel.

LORI
She finally rolls-in.

Tree just stares at her.

LORI (CONT'D)
You were sort of a mess last
night.

TREE
Dancing on a table, barfing
pretzel chunks?

LORI
You remember. I’m shocked.
22.

TREE
(re: the deja vu)
So weird.
LORI

Oh, and you rammed your tongue
down Nick Sims’ throat right in
front of Danielle.

TREE
I‘'m...late for class.

Grabbing her backpack, Tree immediately finds her book on
the desk. When she looks up, Lori has the cupcake.

LORI
Did you really think you could
keep it a secret from me?

She hands the cupcake to Tree who is still totally
tripping.
LORI (CONT'D)
Don’t you wanna know how I found
out?

TREE
You looked at my driver's license.

LORI
Well, aren’t you the clever one.

TREE
I gotta go.

Tree sets the cupcake down.
LORI
But you didn’t even blow the
candle out.

She’s gone, pulling the door shut behind her. The wind
BLOWS the candle out anyway.

Confused by Tree’s odd demeanor, Lori looks down at the
cupcake.

CLOSE ON...

The candle...a sinewy rope of smoke rising from the
extinguished wick.
23.

EXT. THE PATIO - AFTERNOON

The Delta’s are around the table as before. Tree is
spacing out as Danielle holds court.

DANIELLE
-- and we still need to pick this
year’s charity. I can say right
now, there is no way we're doing
the Special Needs art fair again.
All those tards want to do is hug.
Totally freaked my shit out.
Thoughts?

Becky arrives with her lunch tray.

BECKY
What’s wrong?
DANIELLE
I don’t know. What’s wrong Tree?
Tree suddenly looks up -- she only caught the tail-end of
the conversation.
TREE
I’m just a little tired, I guess.
DANIELLE
No, dumb-ass. What’s wrong with

that?
She points at Becky’s food. Tree shakes her head.

DANIELLE (CONT’D)
So not Kappa-cuisine. And is that
chocolate milk I see?

BECKY
(ashamed)
I missed breakfast.

Humiliated, Becky stands with her tray, she starts to
turn...

TREE
Becky, look out!

SLAM! Becky collides with Carter. The chocolate milk
splashes all over Tree. Danielle cracks up. Carter grabs
some napkins from the dispenser on the table.
24.

CARTER
I’m so sorry, Tree.
DANIELLE
You two know each other?
TREE CARTER
No. Yes.
Tree slowly turns and looks at Carter -- he sees the fear

in her eyes. Translates it quickly:

CARTER
We...had a class together last
year.
(to Tree)
Sorry again.
He starts to walk off.
TREE
Hey!
He stops turns around. Tree walks up to him -- clears her

throat awkwardly. Carter stares at her like she’s crazy
until he looks down and sees her open hand.

TREE (CONT'D)
My bracelet?

CARTER
Oh. Yeah. Here--

Reaching into his pocket, he drops it into the palm of
her hand. For a split-second Tree pauses -- how did she
know he had it on him? Tree finally turns around and
walks away.

DANIELLE (0.C.)
What a douche-bag.

INT. CAMPUS BOOKSTORE - CONTINUOUS

Tree, her blue smock covers her chocolate milk stain,
thumbs through her US Weekly... her brow is furrowed,
this is all so fucking familiar to her. It is irritating.

She suddenly recalls Leonard approaching. Tree quickly
hides the magazine and pretends to be pricing down some
dictionaries with a red pen. He eyes her suspiciously.
25.

LEONARD
What are you doing?
TREE
(duh? )
Working.
LEONARD

I believe you’re supposed to be

unpacking the new shipment, not

pricing dictionaries.
Tree drops the marker and gets up. As she heads toward
the back, she passes the display of school spirit
paraphernalia.
She freezes --
--and picks something up we don’t see.
Trees looks like she’s just seen a ghost. Her own.
Off screen, there’s a loud BANG! Tree looks to her right
where Keith has just dropped something. He looks at Tree.
There’s something peculiar in his eyes.

Tree hurries past the stock room door. Keith moves to the
display and studies what Tree just set down...

A MASK.

Keith’s big, meaty hand curls around the mask as he
slowly brings it to his face -- his breathing even louder
behind the eerie plastic grin.

There’s a FULL-LENGTH MIRROR to his right -- Keith twists
his head to the right and meets his masked reflection.

Off his silent stare...
INT. CAMPUS HOSPITAL - AFTERNOON

Tree enters the lobby. Her cell phone plays “Happy
Birthday”. Tree checks the LCD: INCOMING CALL FROM DAD.

She instantly hits the IGNORE button as she stops in
front of the elevators. The doors open as LORI steps out,
wearing her NURSING SCRUBS.
26.

TREE
(surprised)
Lori...
LORI
Hi.

She steps out. This time Tree steps into the elevator.
The doors start to close but Lori’s hand catches the
bumper. The doors open.

LORI (CONT'D)
Everything okay?

TREE
Yeah. Fine.

LORI
You were acting really weird this
morning.

TREE

I’m having a weird day.

LORI
Look, it’s none of my business but
I think eventually something like
that is bound to have some pretty
serious consequences.

TREE
Lori, I really can’t talk right
now.

LORI

Fine...it’s your life.
Lori pulls her hand back, letting the doors close.
INT. GREGORY'S OFFICE - AFTERNOON

Alone, Tree turns over the wedding photo without looking
at it. She pushes the photo under some papers.

Gregory enters, and quickly closes the door.

GREGORY
We can’t do this. There’s too
much going on in the building
today.
27.

TREE
I need to talk to you.

She reaches around him... to LOCK THE DOOR.

GREGORY
Tree, I know what you’re going to
say.

TREE
You do?

Gregory puts his CAR KEYS in his desk.

GREGORY
It’s normal for a young girl to
have feelings for an older man.
But you can’t let it cross that
line. You can’t fall in love.

TREE
I’m not falling in love with you.

GREGORY
(relieved)
You’re not?

TREE
No. I’ve been having--

Overcome with lust at her proximity, Gregory lifts her to
his desk and starts to kiss her -- Tree resists but he’s
not stopping. Tree is overcome by a sudden sense of
dread. She pushes him back.

TREE (CONT'D)
(breathless)
Your...wife?

He stops.

GREGORY
Okay. That’s kind of a buzz kill.

A jangling of the doorknob. And then a loud knocking!

STEPHANIE (0.S.)
Gregory? Are you in there?
28.

GREGORY
(hushed)
Thank god you locked the door!

Tree and Gregory hurriedly adjust their clothing and open
the door -- Gregory giving a lame:

GREGORY (CONT’D)
Didn‘t realize I locked the door.
Have you met my student Teresa?

STEPHANIE
No, I don’t think I have.

TREE
Hi.

Tree edges past. Stephanie gives Gregory a look regarding
Tree: What was that about...? Gregory gives the loopdy-
loop international sign for Parts On Order.

INT. 4TH FLOOR -- HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS

Heading toward the elevator, Tree passes the nurse’s
station and overhears a couple NURSES whispering.

NURSE#1
Well, I’m not comfortable with it.

NURSE#2
Me neither.

They both look up at Tree at the same time. Tree’s
immediate thought...Do they know about her and Gregory?

Diverting her eyes, Tree reaches the elevators. While she
waits, she notices the POLICE OFFICER sitting at the end
of the hall. Was he in her “dream”? (YES)

INT. TREE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

“Road Rules” is on the TV. Tree is at her dresser,
looking at the same picture from her high school
graduation. There’s a knock at the door...

Tree stuffs the photo into the top drawer as Danielle
enters.

She’s all dolled-up. Tree recognizes her top instantly.
Reading Tree’s expression:
29.

DANIELLE
I know. I’m just borrowing it for
tonight. How cute is it on me?

Overwhelmed by her deja vu, Tree looks at the TV -- she
recognizes the challenge on “Road Rules”.

DANIELLE (0.C.) (CONT’D)
What time are you going to the
party tonight?
(Tree doesn’t hear
her)
Hello?...earth to space-bitch...

Tree snaps out of it.

TREE
Huh?

DANIELLE
(pretending to use
sign-language)
What-time-are-you-going-to-the-

party?
TREE
I don’t know...later.
BLACKOUT.
TREE (CONT'D)
Oh my god!

The lights come back on.

DANIELLE
Our tuition dollars at work.

She sees the fear in Tree's eyes.

DANIELLE (CONT’D)
Chill out. It’s just another
rolling blackout, sweetie.

TREE
(hopeful)
It happened before?
30.

DANIELLE
Yeah, like two weeks ago. I
remember because I was running on
the treadmill and almost ate shit.
I don’t know what’s so hard about
keeping the electricity on.
Anyhoo...don’t be too late or all
the cute Sigma boys will be taken.

She leaves. We HOLD ON Tree -- her face wrought with a
mounting sense of dread.

EXT. THE THOROUGHFARE - NIGHT

Tree, in a resplendent white cotton dress, leaves her
house and looks around. The area is completely empty of
people. Most everyone at their respective pledge houses.

Tree checks her VOICE MAIL as she walks at a brisk clip.

GREGORY
(on the phone)
Hey, it's me. I'll text you later
about meeting tonight. Not sure if
I can get away but I'll do my
best. By the way, that was close
this afternoon. But kinda hot.

SAVE -- NEXT MESSAGE...

ALAN
(pissed)
Tree, it's dad. I sat in that
restaurant waiting for you for
almost an hour --

DELETE. Tree snaps her phone shut.

At the path she comes upon a blocked off area. A palpable
dread washes over her.

She glances at her watch. 10:43.

The lights are off along the cordoned and torn up path.
But it is the shortest way to the Quad.

TREE
(chiding herself)
You’re being an idiot. It was just
a dream.
31.

Tree steps around the wooden barriers...
EXT. THE PATH - NIGHT
She walks the path...skittish, but nope. Nothing.

She comes across a ditch exposing a water pipe. She
needs to edge around it, towards the trees.

Off screen a branch SNAPS! Tree freezes...

TREE
Hello? Somebody there?

She looks around. All seems quiet and still until she
catches something or someone move in her periphery....

Tree spins around. Just more space and the woods
beyond...but Tree’s eyes zero-in on something peeking out
from behind one of the trees...

A FAINT GLIMMER OF LIGHT.

LIKE THE TIP OF A KNIFE.

Is somebody hiding behind the tree? Waiting?

TREE (CONT'D)
Screw this.

Tree turns and runs back the way she came and practically
leaps over the wooden barrier.

EXT. FRAT HOUSE - EVENING

Hurrying up the path, Tree reaches the front door and
rings the bell. It’s oddly quiet for a usually racous
place.

Tree looks back over her shoulder to make sure she’s not
being followed. When she turns back the door is already
open.

Tree’s POV --

-- THE MASK instantly appears out of the darkness!

Tree SCREAMS and throws a right hook! BAM!

The lights suddenly turn on revealing a CROWD gathered in
the doorway.
32.

There’s a big “HAPPY BIRTHDAY” banner hanging on the
wall. Everyone is staring at Tree in shock.

Somewhere in the back of the crowd, someone says:

PERSON (0.C.)
Happy Birthday?

The guy who just got slugged, NICK SIMS (21, major
hottie) pulls his mask off, rubbing his red and swelling
cheek.

NICK
What the hell, Tree?!

TREE
Oh my god! I thought you -- I
thought I was -- I’m so sorry.

Danielle steps forward, addressing the crowd:

DANIELLE
Don’t mess with a Kappa bitch!

The crowd cheers, bringing the levity back to the affair.
Somebody CRANKS the music as Danielle pulls Tree into a
hug.

INT. FRAT HOUSE - EVENING

The party is in full swing. Empty plastic cups shake on
the speakers pumping out some old school party anthem.

Pushing through the throngs of REVELERS we find Tree in
the corner with Danielle and some other randoms.

Tree checks her cell phone -- no new messages. The
disappointment registers on her face.

DANIELLE
(looking around)
That slut.
TREE
Who?
DANIELLE

Lori. She said she’d be here.
She’s so out of the house next
year.
33.

TREE
I think she had a double shift.

DANIELLE
Whatevs. She’s been boning some
mystery guy.

Nick saddles up to Tree and offers her a beer.

NICK
Truce?

TREE
You know I didn’t mean it.

Danielle tries to wedge herself between these two --
there’s lots of hair-flipping and eye-lash batting but
it’s pretty obvious that Nick is more interested in Tree.

TREE (CONT'D)
Why were you wearing that stupid
mask in the first place?

NICK
Big game’s on Friday. Just showing
a little school spirit. Didn’t
think I'd get clocked for it.

Danielle laughs REALLY LOUD. It’s desperate and draws an
annoyed look from Nick.

TREE
I really am sorry. Did you ice it?

NICK
It’s fine.
(devilish grin)
You can make it up to me later.

He gives her a knowing wink before heading off into the
crowd. Danielle looks like she’s going to kill Tree.

TREE
What?

DANIELLE
Don’t “what” me. You know exactly
what you’re doing, Tree.

TREE
Danielle--
34.

Danielle storms off in a huff. Tree’s CELL PHONE chimes.
She looks at the screen. 1 NEW TEXT.

It’s from Gregory:
“Sorry...can’t get away tonight. C U tomorrow?”

Hurt, Tree snaps the phone shut. Surrounded by people she
hardly knows or hardly wants to know, Tree looks sad and
alone.

Tree starts pushing her way toward the front door when
she sees something--

--Nick. Heading upstairs. He looks right at Tree and
flashes a smile that says “follow me”.

INT. UPSTAIRS HALL -- FRAT HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Tree reaches the top of the stairs, but Nick is already
gone.

TREE
Nick?

She starts down the hall. Tries the first door on her
right.

Tree’s POV -- THE BATHROOM. Two Kappa PARTY GIRLS (X-ing;
eyes-wide, pupils totally dilated) are standing shoulder
to shoulder at the sink. One of them is staring at
herself in the mirror while the other pets a wash-cloth
like it was her cat.

PARTY GIRL #1
(staring)
I'm so pretty...
PARTY GIRL #2
(petting)
It's so soft...
They don’t even see Tree as she closes the door.

A little further down the hall, Tree tries another
door...

Tree’s POV -- HALL CLOSET. A drunk COUPLE is getting it
on.

She quickly shuts the door.
35.

The next door to her left is slightly ajar...
INT. NICK’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Nick is sitting on the bed wearing the MASK.

TREE
You want me to hit you again?

He stands and approaches her. Face to face, Tree laughs:

TREE (CONT'D)
Okay, I’m not into kinky. Lose the
mask.

She tries taking the mask off but he stops her with a
GLOVED HAND.

TREE (CONT'D)
What’s going on?

She sees something over his shoulder...her eyes go WIDE
with terror!

ANGLE ON -- THE CLOSET

Nick’s semi-naked BODY lies on the closet floor. Blood
pooling around him.

Tree starts to scream as her KILLER grabs her throat! He
pulls out a knife! Before he can stab her, she’s already
swinging a FRATERNITY PADDLE she grabbed off the night
stand!

WHACK!

The hard wood, cracks his arm, knocking the knife out of
the killer’s grip -- it drops behind the headboard!

Tree tries to go for the door but he blocks her!

TREE (CONT'D)
(screaming)
SOMEBODY HELP ME!

The music and crowd-walla easily drown-out her cries for
help.

The killer grabs a HOCKEY STICK mounted on the wall as
Tree backpedals toward the window. She pulls it half-way
open when the killer takes a swing! Tree ducks!
36.

CLOSE ON

The bottom of the window frame as the hockey stick shears
off the bottom of the wooden frame, exposing the jagged
GLASS.

Trying to squirm away, Tree loses her footing and falls
back onto the window sill. The killer’s gloved hand pins
her down!

Looking up, Tree sees the sharp, exposed GLASS directly
above her throat.

TREE (CONT'D)
NO!!!

The attacker grips the top of the frame and SLAMS the
window shut!

SLAM CUT:
INT. CARTER’S DORM ROOM - MORNING
Tree wakes with a SCREAM. Clawing herself up into a
seated position. Outside, the bell chimes the hour as
Tree’s eyes dart around the room -- noting all the
familiar bits and pieces.
TREE
This can’t be happening...this
can’t be real!

Carter is staring back at Tree, mouth agape.

CARTER
Everything. ..okay?

Cue “Happy Birthday” from Trees cell phone. She grabs the
phone from her clothes on the night stand.

CLOSE ON -- THE LCD SCREEN
INCOMING CALL FROM “DAD”

On the brink of hysteria, Tree grabs her clothes and
starts changing.

Carter turns his back to her.
37.

CARTER (CONT’D)
I don’t know if you remember my
name. You were --

TREE
--pretty wasted last night.
CARTER
Yeah.
TREE
And you’re name’s Carter?
CARTER
(perking-up)
Yeah.
TREE

But we’ve never met before?

CARTER
Not until last night. I mean, I’ve
seen you around campus but we
don’t exactly move in the same
circles.

Tree’s eyes fill with tears.

TREE
This is a nightmare....

CARTER
(hurt/defensive)
I’m sorry...but you’re the one who
wanted to come here last night!

Tree shoves him out of the way and runs for the door. She
sees the sticker again.

TREE
Oh-my-god.

Tree throws her weight into the door, as it swings open --

FRESHMAN (0.C.)
Dude! Did you--

The door SMASHES the lanky kid in the face!

FRESHMAN (CONT'D)
Ow! Sonofa--
38.

He sees Tree. Sees the tears running down her cheeks.

FRESHMAN (CONT'D)
Oh. Hey.

Tree pushes him out of the way and runs down the hall.
The Freshman shoots Carter a look.

FRESHMAN (CONT'D)
Nice one, dickweed.

EXT. THE CAMPUS - MORNING
A distraught Tree hurries through the bustling campus.

She tries to side-steps the female PROTESTER who thrusts
a petition at her.

STUDENT PROTESTER
Stop global warming!

Tree slaps the clipboard away.

STUDENT PROTESTER (CONT’D)
(shouting after her)
A simple “no-thanks” would do!

Car alarm...
Sprinklers...

TREE passes a group of FRAT PLEDGES singing loudly. THE
FRAT BROTHER stands beside a sign: “26th Straight Hour”.

FRAT PLEDGES
-- not a Willie or a Sam! I’m the
eighth ole’ man named Henry!
Henry the Eighth, I am!

FRAT BROTHER
Second verse, same as the first!

FRAT PLEDGES
Oh, Henry the Eighth, I am, I
am!...

The crowd of onlookers cheer as one EXHAUSTED FRAT PLEDGE
passes out, hitting his head hard on the pavement.
39.

Horrified by the re-play, Tree begins to run blindly!
Reaching the end of the quad, Tree bounds down the steps
and CRASHES into...

Keith.

KEITH
Morning Tree.

Tree backs away from him. Eyes wide with fear.

KEITH (CONT'D)
Tree--

She keeps running.

INT. KAPPA DELTA HOUSE - MORNING

Tree slams the door shut. She starts for the stairs but
is forced to grab the rail. She’s having a hard time

breathing.

DANIELLE (0.C.)
Oh-my-god. You sneaky beeyotch!

Tree turns around. Danielle sees tear-streaked cheeks,
the wild look in her eyes.

DANIELLE (CONT’D)
What’s wrong?

She can’t answer. Doesn’t know how to explain. Instead,
she just runs up the stairs.

DANIELLE (CONT'D)
Tree?!

She vanishes around the corner.
DANIELLE (CONT’D)
(baffled)
Freakshow.
INT. TREE’S BEDROOM - MORNING
Tree throws herself on her bed and sobs into her pillow.
Lori steps out of the bathroom, wet and wrapped in a
towel.

LORI
She finally rolls-in.
40.

Lori realizes Tree’s upset.

LORI (CONT'D)
Hey, what’s wrong?

TREE
I feel like I’m losing my mind,
Lori. I don’t know what’s
happening to me. I’m so confused.

LORI
Just calm down and start from the
beginning.

Tree takes a deep breath.

TREE
Have you ever had deja vu?

LORI
Sure. Everybody has.

TREE
Well, I’m having it but like...big
time. This isn’t going to make any
sense but, I’ve already lived
through this day. Twice.

LORI
Tree--

TREE
I know! It’s not possible but it’s
happening! I swear to god!

LORI
Look, Tree, I know this is a hard
day with your mom and all.

TREE
You made me a cupcake! For my
birthday! You’re about to give it
to me, right? And later tonight
there’s a surprise party!

LORI
Who told you? Was it Becky?
4l.

TREE
No! Nobody told me! Don’t you see?
I know what’s going to happen
before it happens!

Tree grabs Lori’s arm, desperate/afraid.

TREE (CONT'D)
Lori, somebody’s going to kill me
today.

Lori looks at Tree in total shock -- but she suddenly
cracks a smile and laughs.

LORI
Okay. I get it. Who put you up to
this? Danielle?

TREE
No! This isn’t some stupid joke!
I’m being totally serious! It’s
already happened! But I don’t know
who it is!

LORI
Okay, Tree...you’re starting to
freak me out.

TREE
How do you think I feel?!

LORI
Tree, listen to me. Nobody’s
trying to kill you.

TREE
Yes, they are--

LORI
Tree! Look at me!

Gripping Tree by the shoulders, Lori looks into her eyes.

LORI (CONT'D)
You need to take the day off. Skip
class. Get some rest. Maybe you
can talk to somebody.

TREE
Who?
42.

INT. STUDENT HEALTH CENTER - AFTERNOON

We're CLOSE ON a “FEELINGS CHART” (a poster featuring a
series of cartoon faces with categorized moods matching
corresponding expressions.)

Tree sits rigidly on a floral print sofa, surrounded by
other posters encouraging “COMMUNICATION!” and
proclaiming “DEPRESSION: IT’S NOT YOUR FAULT”.

A light rap on the door precedes the entrance of DR. MARY
TURTLEBAUM (late 30’s, wispy, doe-eyed, saccharine). She
checks her file before offering her hand.

MARY
Hello, Teresa, I’m Mary.

Mary sits down across from Tree, pen and pad at the
ready.

MARY (CONT'D)
So, Teresa...what brings you here
today?

Tree struggles with how to even broach her crisis. After
a few prolonged seconds of false-starts and hand-
wringing, she decides just to blurt it out:

TREE
I’m reliving the same day over and
over.

MARY

That’s fairly common. Lots of
people feel stuck in a rut. The
routine of life can often feel--

TREE
No, you don’t get it! I’m
literally living the same day over
and over! It’s like I can’t get
out of it! And somebody keeps

killing me!
MARY
I’m sorry?
TREE
He’s wearing one of those school

masks!
(MORE)
43.

TREE (CONT'D)
The other night -- which will
actually be tonight --he stabbed
me to death near the quad and then
last night he chopped my head off
with a window!

(off Mary’s reaction)
It was broken. He smashed it with
a hockey stick.

(off Mary’s raised

eyebrow)
Nevermind. Point is, I keep dying
and then waking up. I’m scared out
of my mind! I don’t want to die
again!

Mary takes a beat to put this all down in her pad. Tree
waits in agony for a response, for some miraculous
intervention that’s going to make sense of it all. What
she gets is:

MARY

(sing-song)
Okee-dokey. I’m just going to
recap to make sure I’m getting
this straight.

(reading from her

note pad)
You wake up today, Tuesday the
18th, and you re-live the same day
over and over, and the same exact
things happen in a specific,
linear order, before a maniac
wearing a mask stabs you or chops
your head off, and then you wake
up and start all over again?

TREE
Yes! But you make it sound so
crazy when you say it like that!

MARY
Teresa, first of all, there’s no
such thing as “crazy”. There’s a
very logical explanation for
what’s happening to you.

TREE
There is?
44,

MARY
Of course. Stress, fatigue,
repressed emotional trauma --
these are all powerful triggers.
Now what we can do, together, is
figure out which of these factors
is playing a role in
your...situation.

Tree stares at Mary incredulously as Mary begins flipping
through her schedule book.

MARY (CONT'D)
I’m a little booked tomorrow, but
Thursday is wide open.

TREE
Lady, have you heard a single word
I’ve said?! I can’t come in
Thursday! I’1l be dead!

MARY

(placating)
I’m so sorry, Teresa. You’re
absolutely right. What I meant to
say was, in two days, which will
still be today, you can come in
and we can get down to the bottom
of this.

TREE
Right. Sounds great. I'll just die
a couple more times before I come
back here to sit on this ugly
couch so you can make me feel
crazy and then tell me there’s no
such thing as crazy even though
what’s happening to me is totally-
fucking-crazy!

Tree jumps up and grabs her bag.

TREE (CONT'D)
Thanks for the help.

She storms out and slams the door so hard the “FEELINGS”
poster falls off the wall.
45.

INT. TREE’S BEDROOM - EVENING

The dresser slowly lumbers across the floor as Tree
pushes it flush against her bedroom door. Along the way,
a few items fall off the top -- including Tree’s
graduation PHOTO with mom and dad.

Tree picks it up, studies the image for a second, tracing
her finger over her mother’s smiling face.

Suddenly, somebody tries the handle. Tree looks at the
door startled.

There’s a knock then:

DANIELLE (0.S.)
Tree? Why’s the door locked?

TREE
I’m...uh...just need a little
privacy.

DANIELLE (0.S.)
What time are you going to the
party tonight?

TREE
I don’t know...later.

Tree looks at the clock -- 9:22
Then the digit changes to 9:23
BLACKOUT.

DANIELLE (0.S.)
Our tuition dollars at work.

The lights turn back on.
DANIELLE (0.S.) (CONT’D)
Anyhoo...don’t be too late or all
the cute Sigma boys will be taken.

Tree listens to Danielle’s FOOTSTEPS walking away -- her
eyes suddenly filling with purpose...
46.

INT. TREE’S BEDROOM - LATER

Tree has dismantled her Ikea night stand and is nailing
the wood panels over the windows. Finished, she gives
them a good tug to be sure they’re secure.

With the windows sealed-shut and the door locked and
securely blocked, she feels “safe”.

TV back on, Tree finds the CUPCAKE Lori made for her

sitting on her desk. She settles onto her bed and begins
peeling the paper off of her treat. About to take a bite,
Tree notices the “Road Rules” marathon is still playing.
It feels like a bad omen, she opts for a station change.

Tree begins searching for the remote but it’s nowhere to
be found.

TREE
(annoyed)

Lori...what’d she do with the

freagin’ remote?
Tree goes to her desk, riffling through loose papers when
she comes upon her stack of mail and THE BLACK ENVELOPE.
There’s no post mark and the front is blank.
Perplexed, Tree opens it...
Inside the envelope is one of those 3-D cards featuring a
weird little Elf waving a “Happy Birthday” sign attached
to a tiny spring. As the sign bounces the Elf GIGGLES
through a tiny, hidden voice box.

On the blank side of the card, written in black marker, a
child-like scrawl reads:

“HOPE IT’S YOUR LAST ONE...”

Disturbed, Tree slowly lowers the card when --
The TV turns off.

Tree looks at it.

TREE (CONT'D)
What the hell?

She walks over and turns it back on manually. “Road
Rules”. Tree immediately changes the channel.
47.

CLOSE ON -- THE TELEVISION SCREEN

The first station change brings us to the famous opening
credits of “The Twilight Zone”.

TREE (CONT'D)
No shit.

She changes the channel again to an unfolding “Breaking
Story” on a local news station. A female REPORTER
standing outside the entrance to an EMERGENCY ROOM.
REPORTER
--where suspected murderer Joseph
Tombs is being treated for a
gunshot wound following a deadly
shoot-out this morning that left
one officer dead.
The story CUTS TO a MUG-SHOT of the menacing killer.
REPORTER (CONT’D)
Tombs had been the subject of a
nationwide manhunt--
The TV suddenly TURNS OFF AGAIN...

Tree freezes. In the stillness, we HEAR a scraping noise
coming from

THE CLOSET.

At this moment, it dawns on Tree that she never checked
the room before she barricaded herself inside.

Picking up the HAMMER, Tree advances slowly toward the
closet -- the door is slightly ajar.

She grips the handle...raises the hammer, ready to
strike...

PULLS!
ANGLE ON -- THE CLOSET
Empty.

Tree notes a lone wire hanger, gently scraping on the
wall.
48.

She sighs with relief and closes the door. But as she
turns around, Tree’s focus moves to another part of the
room...

THE BATHROOM.

Through the open doorway, she can see the shower -- the
opaque curtain is drawn. Did it just move a little?

Tree crosses the room.
IN THE BATHROOM

Tree stops at the shower. As she reaches out for the
curtain...

The TV turns back on! A loud COMMERCIAL blares, scaring
the shit out of us!

Spinning around, Tree looks at the TV. Her eyes slowly
move to the bed and then the slip cover where the sole of
a BLACK BOOT is just sticking out from under the fabric.

He's hiding under the bed!

Tip-toeing back into the bedroom, Tree gingerly kneels
down in front of the bed, keeping her hammer at the
ready.

Looking over Tree’s shoulder, we SEE the shower curtain
is OPEN -- as the masked killer emerges from the
bathroom!

Tree doesn’t see him creeping toward her, the long blade
of his knife at his side...

Tree yanks the slip up and finds the boot -- but it’s not
attached to anybody. That’s when she HEARS it...

BREATHING.
Tree slowly turns around...

Before she can scream the killer strikes! Tree narrowly
dodges the blade as it digs into the mattress!

Running for her door, Tree tries to push the dresser out
of the way but there isn’t time! The killer is already
behind her.
49.

INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE TREE'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

We HEAR Tree screaming in agony as her blood begins to
spill-out under the crack of the blocked door...

SLAM CUT:
INT. CARTER’S DORM ROOM - MORNING
The tolling bells outside are drowned out by Tree’s
hysterical awakening -- THRASHING and SCREAMING so loud

that Carter himself screams from the shock!

CARTER
What’s wrong?!

Jumping out of bed too quickly, Tree suddenly doubles-
over in pain. Carter rushes to her side.

CARTER (CONT'D)
Tree ---

She shoves him back. Her cell phone plays “Happy
Birthday”. Tree grabs the phone and throws it against the
wall.

TREE
SHUT UP!!!

Afraid, Carter jumps back. Tree grabs her head,
distraught.

TREE (CONT'D)
Ohmygod..ohmygod...make it stop,
please make it stop...

Carter tries to approach Tree again.

CARTER
What’s wrong? Are you sick?

TREE
Just get away from me!

Pain subsiding, Tree pulls the T-shirt off and starts
changing into her clothes. Carter spins around.

CARTER
I don’t know what’s going on but --
50.

Carter turns around -- Tree’s already out the door. A
second later, the lanky freshman peeks into Carter's
room.
FRESHMAN

Dude...what's up the psycho-

hottie?
EXT. THE CAMPUS - MORNING
Tree staggers through the crowded thoroughfare -- her
eyes darting left and right. Everyone she passes has an
air of menace.
Anyone could be her killer.
TREE’S POV -- VARIOUS “SUSPECTS” STARING BACK...

* A PROFESSOR peering at us over the rim of his coffee
cup.

* A PAINTER, wearing a bandana over his mouth, looks up
from his work to tracks us with his eyes.

* A STUDENT VENDOR, working behind an espresso kiosk,
stares at us through a glass partition.

Becoming winded again, Tree stops in the middle of the
walk way. The student protester thrusts the petition at
Tree!

STUDENT PROTESTER
Stop global warming!

Tree staggers back.
The car alarm goes off.
Then the sprinklers.
Behind her, the FRAT GUYS are singing...
FRAT PLEDGES
-- not a Willie or a Sam! I’m the
eighth ole’ man named Henry!

Henry the Eighth, I am!

FRAT BROTHER
Second verse, same as the first!
51.

Tree begins to turn in a circle, the world spinning
around her in a kaleidoscopic nightmare!

The protester, the car alarm and the frat guy’s voices
grow louder and louder!

Students begin to stop and stare at Tree, who is caught
in the middle like a trapped animal.

The world begins to whirl faster and faster...
The voices become louder and louder...

Until everything builds to a deafening crescendo!
And Tree collapses onto the pavement.

INT. TREE’S HOSPITAL ROOM - AFTERNOON

Tree is arguing with DR. ELLIOT WINTER (50’s, kind face).
Arms folded, pouting like an indignant little girl, Tree
doesn’t want to be here.

TREE
It’s just a concussion right?
That’s not a big deal. Why can’t I
go?

DR. WINTER
Where’s your father? We’ve been
trying to contact him but we must
have an old number on file.

TREE
What do you need him for?

DR. WINTER
We need your full medical history.
Our system’s down from the rolling
black-outs and we can’t retrieve
any records. Specifically, we're
trying to find out how many times
you've been hospitalized.

TREE
Never.

DR. WINTER
Excuse me?
52.

TREE
I’ve never been hospitalized
before.

A grave expression falls over the doctor’s face.

TREE (CONT'D)
What?

Dr. Winter opens a file and puts up a series of X-RAYS on
the LIGHT BOARD.

DR. WINTER
We just got these back from the
lab. You see here --

He runs his finger over a CHEST X-RAY.

DR. WINTER (CONT'D)
These are your lungs. There’s some
scar tissue here. At first we
thought it was a sign of

pneumothorax.

(off Tree’s blank

stare)
A collapsed lung. But then we saw
these...

He points to light-colored lines crisscrossing through
her NECK and LOWER ABDOMEN.

DR. WINTER (CONT'D)
These are signs of major trauma,
Teresa. Given the severity of the
scar tissue and the size of the
lesions...

He shakes his head, unable to finish his sentence.

TREE
What?!

Slowly, Dr. Winter turns his baffled gaze on Tree.

DR. WINTER
You should be dead.

The words sink in slowly.
53.

DR. WINTER (CONT'D)
We're going to keep you here for
observation. Your heart rate’s a
little low and we need--

TREE
(interrupting)
I have to go.

Tree starts to get out of bed.

DR. WINTER
Whoa. Hold, on. You’re not going
anywhere.

TREE
I have to go! He’s going to kill
me again!

Dr. Winter forces Tree back into her bed.

DR. WINTER

Teresa, I need you to calm down...
TREE

NO! LET ME GO!
DR. WINTER

(calling out)
I need a little help in here!

Two NURSE’S rush into the room.
DR. WINTER (CONT'D)
Get me three cc’s of pentobarbital
right away.

Tree grabs Dr. Winter’s arms, pleading desperately:

TREE
Please...I don’t want to die
again...

DR. WINTER

Nobody’s going to hurt you Teresa.
We just want to help.

The nurse returns with the shot. Tree takes one look at
the needle and starts freaking out.
54.

DR. WINTER (CONT'D)

(shouting at the

nurses)

Hold her down, damn it!

Arms pinned, Tree is helpless as the needle sinks into
her skin. She begins to slow down, losing her motor
skills. In a matter of seconds, she’s out again.
INT. TREE’S HOSPITAL ROOM - EVENING

A thick silence fills the air as Tree slowly begins to
emerge from the fog of her sedation.

From her blurry POV we’re looking at the door. It slowly
begins to OPEN.

A MAN enters...

As he draws closer, we SEE he’s wearing THE MASK.

Tree opens her mouth to scream, but no sound comes out!
He reaches out to grab her! Tree recoils!

But Tree’s vision pulls into focus and she realizes it’s
just Gregory and he’s not wearing a mask.

He sits beside her.

GREGORY
Hey...Tree it’s me. It’s okay.
TREE
(alarmed)

What are you doing in here?
GREGORY

Just checking on you. I heard they

had to sedate you. The drugs take

a little while to wear off.

TREE
What day is it?

GREGORY
Tuesday, the 18th. Why?

Tree closes her eyes. It wasn't a bad dream.

Her eyes fill with tears.
55.

TREE
Nobody...believes me.

GREGORY
Believes what?

TREE
That I’m dying...every day.

Must be the drugs.
Gregory brushes her hair out of her face.
GREGORY

I can’t stay long. Stephanie’s
gotten us into some god-awful
charity thing tonight. But I‘1l
come check on you first thing in
the morning.

Tree licks her dry-lips.

TREE
I’m really thirsty.

Gregory starts to pour her some water.

TREE (CONT'D)
No water. Can you get me a Coke?

GREGORY
Sure. Be right back.

He kisses her forehead and leaves.
INT. HALLWAY -- HOSPITAL - MOMENTS LATER
Gregory fights with the machine as it won’t take his
dollar. It finally sucks it in. He punches the button as
the soda can dumps into the tray.
We TRACK Gregory back to Tree’s room.
GREGORY
(announcing as he
enters)
Special delivery...

INT. TREE’S HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Entering the room, Gregory comes to an abrupt halt...
56.

ANGLE ON -- TREE’S EMPTY BED

She's gone.

INT. 4TH FLOOR -- HOSPITAL - SAME

Tree quietly exits the elevator -- there’s only one NURSE
at the station but she’s too busy reading a cheesy
harlequin novel to notice Tree as she tip-toes right past
her.

Reaching the door to Gregory’s office, Tree glances to
her right and notices the POLICE OFFICER isn’t stationed
at the end of the hall. But his chair is still there
beside a fresh, steaming cup of coffee.

INT. GREGORY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Gingerly closing the door behind her, Tree goes straight
to Gregory’s desk and opens the top drawer. She grabs
what she came for...

HIS CAR KEYS.

INT. 4TH FLOOR -- HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS

Peering into the hallway, Tree makes sure the coast is
clear. But as she reaches the elevator, the doors
automatically open.

Tree freezes...

Gregory steps out.

GREGORY
Tree? What are you doing?
Tree bolts!
GREGORY (CONT’D)
Tree!

Running down the hall, Tree makes a desperate dash for
the emergency exit. She’s still weak so it’s easy for
Gregory to gain ground.

Passing a GURNEY, Tree stops to push it in Gregory’s
direction. It slows him down a little but not enough.

Tree collides with the FIRE EXIT DOOR but it doesn’t
budge.
57.

Gregory stops a few feet away from Tree.

GREGORY (CONT’D)
Tree, listen to me --

TREE
YOU KILLED ME!
GREGORY
Tree, you’re delirious. Let me

help you.

Tree turns back to the fire door and begins banging on
the handle.

TREE
Somebody help me!!!

She feels something WET hit her hospital gown. Tree spins
around...

ANGLE ON -- GREGORY

Eyes wide, blood running out of the corner of his mouth.
He collapses to the floor revealing THE KILLER STANDING
BEHIND HIM!

TREE (CONT'D)
No...

The killer rips the knife from Gregory's back!

Tree kicks the handle this time. The door SWINGS OPEN
just as the killer steps over Gregory’s body.

INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

Hobbling down the stairs, Tree looks up as the killer
pursues!

Using everything she’s got, Tree runs down four more
floors until she reaches the FIRST PARKING LEVEL.

INT. PARKING LEVEL 1 - CONTINUOUS

Bursting out the door, Tree screams for help but there’s
no one around.

Behind her, the killer continues his relentless chase.
58.

Tree scans the area, desperately searching for Gregory’s
car. There’s too many! It could be anywhere! She starts
pressing the ALARM button on his key-chain.

The killer is getting closer!

Frantically pressing the button, an alarm finally goes
off two rows over. Tree and the killer are about
equidistant to the flashing lights and honking horn of
Gregory’s car.

They both pause for a split-second. Waiting to see who
makes the first move...

Sucking in a deep breath, Tree goes for it! Running
harder than she’s ever run before in her life!

The killer keeps pace. It looks like they’re going to
make it to Gregory’s car at the same time but Tree gets
there first.

INT. GREGORY’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

Lunging into the car, Tree slams the door shut and hits
the LOCK BUTTON just as the killer SLAMS against the
driver’s side window!

Tree SCREAMS!

The killer immediately begins pounding the glass with the
butt of his knife. Tree tries to start the car but her
hands are trembling too much.

TREE
COME ON!!!

The glass begins to crack!
CLOSE ON -- THE KEY

As it slips into the ignition. Tree starts the engine and
throws it in REVERSE!

Peeling rubber, Gregory’s car flies back and smashes into
a parked car. Looking ahead, Tree sees the killer
standing a few feet ahead.

Slamming the gear into DRIVE she stomps on the pedal --
the car lunges forward. The killer narrowly dives out of
the way!
59.

INT. PARKING LEVEL 1 - CONTINUOUS

The killer slowly rises to his feet as Tree speeds off in
Gregory’s car.

EXT. MAIN ENTRANCE -- POTSDAM UNIVERSITY - NIGHT

Racing off the campus grounds, Gregory’s car fish-tails
onto the main road.

INT. GREGORY’S CAR - NIGHT

The lights of the isolated campus fade from view as Tree
pushes the speedometer past 80.

Realizing she’s escaped, Tree is overcome by a wild
euphoria. She begins pounding the steering wheel,
laughing through her tears.

TREE
I did it!!!

Her celebration is cut short by the sound of SIRENS. Tree
glances into the rear-view window as a POLICE CAR closes-
in behind her.

TREE (CONT'D)
Shit.

Tree slows down and pulls onto the shoulder. OFFICER BILL
SANTORA (40’s, seen too many Clint Eastwood movies)
saunters up to the driver’s side and raps his knuckles on
the glass. Tree rolls the window down, trying to stay
calm.

TREE (CONT'D)
I know. I was speeding.

OFFICER SANTORA
Turn the engine off.

TREE
Sorry, officer.

She kills the engine.

OFFICER SANTORA
License and registration.

TREE
Um...I don’t have them.
60.

OFFICER SANTORA
Pardon?

TREE
(blurting out)
Someone’s trying to kill me again!

OFFICER SANTORA
Again?

TREE

Yes!

(realizing how that

sounds )
I mean no! I mean...he’s tried
before but this time I got away
but I didn’t have time to get my
clothes and my driver’s license
was in my pocket.

Santora grabs his FLASHLIGHT and shines it in Tree's
face. She squints back.

OFFICER SANTORA
Ma’am, are you under the influence
of alcohol or any other controlled
substance?

TREE
No! I’m not--
(pause/epiphany)
Wait. If I am, does that mean
you'll arrest me and put me ina
jail cell?

OFFICER SANTORA
That’s usually how it works.

Realizing she couldn’t be in a safer place:

TREE
I’m drunk!

OFFICER SANTORA
You are?

TREE
Wasted! And I’m high. Pills, weed,
you name it man! I’m on it!

Santora couldn’t be more confused.
61.

OFFICER SANTORA
Well...then I’m placing you under
arrest.

TREE
Good idea.

She gets out of the car. Santora cuffs Tree’s hands
behind her back and leads her to his cruiser. As he opens
the back door, Tree looks at him and smiles.

TREE (CONT'D)
Thank you.

Officer Santora: Weirdo.

He pushes Tree into the backseat. The POLICE RADIO
suddenly CRACKLES.

DISPATCHER
All units, we've got a 187 at the
university hospital.

Santora pauses, listening to the homicide report.

DISPATCHER (CONT’D)
Suspect is believed to be an
escaped patient. Be advised--

As Santora looks at Tree’s hospital gown he’s suddenly
flooded by a BRIGHT LIGHT!

We HEAR an engine roar! Before he can even turn, Santora
is struck by a speeding car! The impact SHEERS the back
door right off as Tree SCREAMS in terror!

The UNKNOWN VEHICLE makes a hard 180 and stops.

Hands cuffed tightly behind her back, Tree struggles to
get out of the cruiser. Feet crunching over broken glass,
she finally manages to shimmy out.

The other car idles...Tree can’t see the DRIVER beyond
the blinding HIGH-BEAMS.

Then she hears it: a door squeaking open. Footsteps begin
to draw closer. Tree looks around, there’s nowhere to
hide. Just miles of woods...

The driver, steps in front of one of the headlights --
backlit, we SEE it’s the masked killer.
62.

TREE
(screaming)
Why are you doing this to me?!

Unsheathing his hunting knife, the killer begins to
advance.

Tree runs!
EXT. WOODS - CONTINUOUS

Fighting for balance, Tree makes a futile attempt to flee
as her killer, with a clear advantage, takes his time.

Toying with her.

Tree screams for help but there’s nothing but miles of
forest.

Branches whip Tree in the face as her bare feet crunch
over twigs and, tiny jagged rocks.

With only a two-second lead, Tree runs as fast as she
can. Looking over her shoulder, the killer is gaining
ground!

Ahead, Tree sees some LIGHTS through the trees up ahead!

TREE
(screaming)
HELP! HELP ME!
She looks back over her shoulder again -- she’s suddenly

confused.
He's not behind her anymore...

Breaking out of the forest, Tree reaches a short clearing
-- she can see the lights of a FARM come into view.

Then she DROPS OUT of frame!

She just ran off a cliff.

We HEAR Tree cry out as she plummets over two hundred
feet! As she’s about to make impact with the jagged ROCKS
below we...

SLAM CUT:

*ALTERNATE DEATH SCENE -- CONT. FROM PAGE 61*
63.

INT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT

Tree has just been placed into the backseat by Officer
Santora. A split-second after he closes the car door...

WHAM!

Santora is struck by a speeding car as it broad-sides the
police car in a flash of scraping metal and flying
sparks!

Tree screams!

Looking though the plexi-glass partition, she can see
Santora’s crumpled body, mercilessly displayed in the
police car's headlights.

Tree looks for the other car but it’s nowhere to be
seen...

Suddenly, a pair of HIGH-BEAMS appear -- blinding Tree as
the car roars toward her at full throttle!

Tree goes for the door handle! But there is none!
ANGLE ON -- THE SPEEDING CAR!
Blazing a head-on collision course!

Tree braces for impact but the other car SLAMS on its
brakes at the last second!

Tires SCREECH! Then...silence.

The cop car is completely flooded with light now. Tree
shields her eyes as we HEAR a door open and close outside
followed by slow, encroaching FOOTSTEPS.

Suddenly a HAND slaps against Tree’s window! Tree yelps
as the MASKED KILLER comes into view, peering at Tree

like a bug in a jar.

TREE
What do you want?!

He presents something to her...A BIRTHDAY CANDLE?
The killer lights it.

What he does next is even more baffling to Tree. He
simply turns around and goes back to his car.
64.

The killer's car starts to back away...headlights fading
until they’re the size of distant FLASHLIGHT BEAMS...

TREE (CONT'D)
(dumbfounded)
Where’s he going?...
And then his lights just GO OUT.
Beat...

OUTSIDE THE KILLER'S CAR:

The black-gloved hand emerges from the open driver’s-side
window holding the birthday candle. He drops it...

WHOOSH !
A FLAME IGNITES!

The fire starts at the killer’s car (driver’s side)
quickly running toward the police car!

BACK IN THE POLICE CAR:

Tree beats on the glass but, it too, is bullet-proof.
Looking toward the rear of the police car, Tree can see
the damaged gas tank -- hemorrhaging GASOLINE from the
previous collision.

ANGLE ON -- THE FLAMES

Running faster and faster in Tree’s direction!

CLOSE ON -- TREE

Face framed in the window as the glass suddenly reflects
an ORANGE/RED glow...

TREE (CONT'D)
Oh Fu--

BOOM!!!
The car explodes into a massive ball of fire!
INT. CARTER’S DORM ROOM - MORNING

The tower bell rings one last time as Tree’s eyes SNAP
OPEN...
65.

ECU -- we SEE the FIRE BALL flare and then vanish in the
reflection of Tree’s eyes.

She sits up and wipes the sweat from her brow. A brief
glance around the room reminds her she’s still trapped in
the same day.

TREE
(sighing)
Here we go again...

The opening bass-line of a White-Stripes-ish song
starts...

BEGIN MONTAGE:

EXT. KAPPA DELTA HOUSE - MORNING

The two KAPPA GIRLS (who were X-ing in the bathroom at
Tree’s B-Day party) stare up at the second floor as
BOOKS, PAPERS, even a LAPTOP fly out of Tree’s bedroom
window.

INT. TREE’S BEDROOM - MORNING

Desk cleared of debris, Tree sits down and begins to jot-
down a list of NAMES in a small note-pad. The “suspects”
include KEITH, STEPHANIE, DANIELLE, and GREGORY... (But
she immediately goes back and crosses off Gregory since
he already died in front of her.)

EXT. KEITH’S DORM ROOM - NIGHT

On her tippy-toes, Tree peers through a first-floor
window. From her POV we can SEE Keith, already fast-
asleep in his over-sized Sponge-Bob pajamas.

Tree looks disappointed as she crosses his name of the
top of the list. She turns around and--

--WHAM!

She collides with the masked killer. Looking down, Tree
finds the handle of a knife protruding from her stomach.

PRELAP: “Happy Birthday” plays on Tree’s cell phone.
66.

INT. CARTER’S DORM ROOM - MORNING

Already, sitting up in Carter’s bed, Tree grabs her
ringing cell phone and makes a perfect basket-toss into
Carter’s trash can.

Carter looks at her: crazy bitch.

INT. BATHROM -- TREE'S BEDROOM - MORNING

Tree cuts huge chunks of her hair off (which has already
been died a hot shade of bright-pink).

EXT. THE PATIO - AFTERNOON

Danielle and the other Kappa girls stare in
horror/disgust as Tree (sporting her new-do) sprays a
bottle of Cheeze-Wiz into her open mouth.

EXT. GREGORY’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Gregory escorts Stephanie (he’s in a tux, she’s ina
gown) out of their up-scale house.

CLOSE ON -- THE PAD as Stephanie’s name is crossed out.
Gregory's sedan pulls out of the circular driveway --
Tree is suddenly tackled by her killer! Tree falls
backward into a KOI POND. She manages to knock the mask
off, but the killer shoves her head UNDERWATER...

Tree’s POV -- through the rippling water, she can’t make
out the identity of her attacker.

INT. CARTER’S DORM ROOM - MORNING

Tree wakes up and instantly leans over Carter’s bedside
to puke a stream of pond-water.

On Carter: gross!
EXT. THE CAMPUS - MORNING

Shot tastefully, Tree strolls down the thoroughfare
COMPLETELY NAKED...

ANGLE ON -- THE STUDYING PAIR as they look up and see
Tree. The sprinklers go off but they don’t even react
because they’re too stunned.

ANGLE ON -~ THE STUDENT PROTESTOR
67.

STUDENT PROTESTER
Stop global war--

She sees Tree and pulls her clipboard back.

ANGLE ON -- THE FRAT PLEDGES who follow Tree’s naked body
with shocked grins. So distracted are they, nobody
notices when the exhausted brother passes-out.

ANGLE ON -- THE STAIRS where Tree crosses paths with
Keith. His eyes look like they’re going to shoot out of
his head. As Tree streaks by, she winks at him. Keith
turns too quickly to follow Tree and loses his footing.
He eats shit down the stairs.

EXT. STREET -- ON CAMPUS - AFTERNOON

Tree is walking with Danielle when a student bumps
Danielle. A BLACK CARD falls out of her bag. Tree grabs
it...it’s just like the one she found in her room
earlier. Danielle looks guilty.

Tree attacks her and a cat-fight ensues right there on
the street. A few BYSTANDERS try to stop them. Danielle
and Tree fall off the sidewalk and onto the street.

We HEAR a HORN blare one long note...

Tree and Danielle both turn as an on-coming BUS speeds
toward them. They both scream in unison then -- SPLAT!

INSERT: Tree’s “suspect list” as Tree crosses off
Danielle’s name.

EXT. THOROUGHFARE - NIGHT

Tree, donning army fatigues and camo face paint, makes
herself small behind a Tree. She waits, clutching a
baseball bat, as we HEAR approaching footsteps...

Just as the killer enters her periphery, Tree jumps out
and SWINGS!

CRACK!

He goes down. But Tree’s face falls when she realizes it
wasn’t the killer. It was just BECKY (her chubby Kappa
sister), sneaking onto campus with a box of doughnuts,
which are now splayed around her unconscious body.
68.

Tree drops the bat and rushes to Becky’s aid. Suddenly,
there’s a SNAPPING SOUND behind Tree. She looks over her
shoulder and finds the killer hovering over her -- armed
with Tree’s own bat!
But instead of screaming, Tree just sighs...
SLOW MOTION: the bat swings in CLOSE-UP and connects with
the side of Tree’s SKULL! Continuing with the motion,
Tree’s head slowly tilts out of frame and lands on--
--A PILLOW as we
END MONTAGE.

MATCH CUT TO:
INT. CARTER’S DORM ROOM - MORNING

Tree’s HEAD lies on the pillow in the same position. She
opens her right-eye, squinting...

Outside, the bell tolls -- wincing in pain, Tree
gradually pushes herself up:

TREE
This-is-getting-really-friggin'-
old...

Looking to her right, she sees Carter staring at her.
“Happy Birthday” plays on her phone.

TREE (CONT'D)
I’m fine. Really.

Tree stands. She grabs her phone and dismisses the call
from her father.

CARTER
I don’t know if you--

She holds her hand up.

TREE
Carter...sshh. A moment.

Carter nods as Tree shuffles over to his desk and
unearths the toiletry bag. She helps herself to his
aspirin.
69.

CARTER
How did you...

He watches Tree pour 2...3...6 pills into the palm of her
hand.

CARTER (CONT’D)
I don’t think you’re supposed to
take that many. You could die.

TREE
If only it were that easy.
(snapping her
fingers)
Water, por-favor.

As Carter retrieves a bottle from his bedside, Tree is
already at his door. She pulls it open -- the lanky
Freshman is already there but before he can say it...

TREE (CONT'D)
Hi. I’m the so-called “fine-
vagine.

Freshman to Tree -- How the hell did she know he was
going to say that?

TREE (CONT'D)

And if that’s the way you refer to
girls, then you and your hand are
going to have a very lasting
relationship.

Tree pushes him back gently.

TREE (CONT'D)
Thanks for stopping by.

And she closes the door in the freshman’s stunned face.

Turning around, Carter is still wearing the same confused
look on his face. Tree takes the bottle of water from him
and knocks back the pills before chugging down what’s
left of the water.

She tosses the empty bottle on the floor and finally
acknowledges Carter’s dumbfounded stare.

TREE (CONT'D)
What?
70.

CARTER
Are you always this charming in
the morning?

TREE
(shit-eating grin)
Just this one.

Tree pulls her T-shirt off. Carter spins around as she
starts getting dressed.

CARTER
So...bad dream?
TREE
Sorry?
CARTER
You were screaming before you fell
out of bed.
TREE

Oh. I was dying. Again.
Dressed, she turns around.

TREE (CONT'D)
It’s a long story.

CARTER

I’ve got nothing to do.
TREE

Trust me. You’1l think I’m

bonkers.

Tree bends down to grab her shoes and starts to leave.
But the same damn sticker gives her pause.

“TODAY IS THE FIRST DAY OF THE REST OF YOUR LIFE”
Tree turns around...

TREE (CONT'D)
Seriously, I hate this sticker.

INT. HALLWAY -- CARTER’S DORM - CONTINUOUS

Carter catches up with Tree at the stairs.
71.

TREE
Why are you following me?

CARTER
I hate when people start something
and they don’t finish.

TREE
Look, no offense, but there’s
really no point in explaining any
of it to you. Every time I try, I
end up sounding crazy which, at
this point, I must be.

She reaches the exit.
EXT. THE CAMPUS - CONTINUOUS

Tree puts her shoes on just outside the dorm. Carter is
still tailing her.

CARTER
So you’re having bad dreams. I
took an elective course on
neurocognition and dream content.

TREE
Hooray for you.

CARTER
Maybe I can help?

TREE
Can you stop me from re-living the
same day, everyday, only to be
murdered by someone I may or may
not know?

Carter stops. Huh?

TREE (CONT'D)
Thought so.

Tree keeps going. Carter catches up again.
CARTER
You literally think you’re re-
living the same day?

TREE
Yup.
72.

CARTER
And somebody kills you?

TREE
Yup again.

They pass the student protestor.

STUDENT PROTESTER
Stop global warming!

She thrusts the clipboard at Tree, who takes it and hands
it off to Carter. It stalls him, leaving Carter in Tree's
wake. He has to run and catch up yet again!
CARTER

Come on. You’re just messing with

me, right? You don’t seriously

think you’re re-living the same

day?
Annoyed, Tree stops.

TREE
Car alarm...

CARTER
What?

Just then, the CAR ALARM goes off.
Tree turns, facing the pair studying on the lawn.

TREE
Sprinklers...

She snaps her fingers and the sprinklers go off.

Tree grabs Carter by his shoulders and turns him to face
the FRAT PLEDGES.

TREE (CONT'D)
See that pledge over there? The
one with the baseball cap?

She points to the exhausted FRAT PLEDGE.

CARTER
Yeah?
73.

TREE
He’s going to pass out right now.

Thump. He goes down on cue. Shocked, Carter slowly turns
and looks at Tree.

TREE (CONT'D)
Any further questions?

INT. DAIRY QUEEN - AFTERNOON

Muzak plays softly in the background as Tree noisily
sucks down the last drops of her Oreo Blizzard through a
straw.

Carter is staring at her, mouth agape.

TREE
Please stop looking at me like I
have a dildo stuck to my forehead.

CARTER
Sorry. I’m just trying to work
this whole thing out.

TREE
And how’s that going for you?

CARTER
I guess it’s kinda like that movie
“Groundhog’s Day”, only you're not
Bill Murray and instead of zany-
fun you're being violently
butchered.

TREE
Well, you’re a nerd. Don’t you
have some scientific theory about
it?

CARTER
First of all, I wouldn’t classify
myself as a nerd.

TREE
Carter, you have a poster of Boba
Fett in your dorm room. You’re a
nerd.
74.

CARTER
Whatever. Just because I like
science fiction doesn’t make me an
expert on crazy chicks trapped in
the same day.

Tree looks down, a little hurt. Carter feels bad.

CARTER (CONT’D)
Look, if I were you I would stop
trying to figure out how it was
happening and start figuring out
why.

TREE
What do you mean?

CARTER
There has to be a reason you’re
stuck in this day. Out of all the
days of your life, this day must
have some kind of meaning.

TREE
But it’s like any other day.
Except the dying part.

Suddenly, Tree’s phone rings -- she looks at her CALLER
ID. It’s DAD again. Tree thinks of answering it...but

balks.

Tree nods.

CARTER
(off the ring-tone)
It’s your birthday?

CARTER (CONT’D)
Hello?!

TREE
So what? Birthdays are just
excuses people make to eat cake
and get presents and shit. There's
no real meaning to a birthday.

CARTER
It’s symbolic! Whoever is killing
you knows it’s your birthday!
75.

CARTER (CONT'D)
Here -—

Carter unfolds a napkin and removes a PEN from his shirt
pocket. Tree stares at the pen.

CARTER (CONT’D)
Okay. That's nerdy. Let’s move on.
Who knows it’s your birthday today
and who would want to kill you?

TREE
Well, thanks to my sorority
sisters, the whole school knows
it’s my birthday. They’re going to
throw me this stupid surprise
party tonight. It could be anyone.
At first I thought it was Gregory,
but he got killed last night.

CARTER
Who's Gregory?

TREE
One of my professors. We’ve been
having an affair.

CARTER
Nice.

TREE
Hey, mister “I brought a drunk
girl home and took advantage of
her". Don’t judge.

CARTER
For the record, I didn’t take
advantage of you. I slept on the
couch.

TREE
(shocked)
We didn’t --

CARTER
No. You were wasted and I was
worried you’d fall or choke on
your own vomit like Janis Joplin.
76.

Sitting across from her in the booth, Tree discovers two
things about Carter: he’s probably the sweetest guy in
the whole world and he’s actually kinda cute.

But she’s not letting her guard down.

TREE
Well...thanks but I would have
been fine.

CARTER

Yeah, I can see that.

Tree manages a laugh. It’s the first time we’ve seen her
smile like this.

EXT. THE CAMPUS - AFTERNOON

Carter is walking Tree back to her house. The sun is out,
the flowers are in bloom, and if they weren’t talking
about Tree dying violently every day, the moment would
almost seem romantic.

CARTER
There has to be somebody you
didn’t think of.

TREE
That’s it. Everyone who'd want to
kill me had a solid alibi.

CARTER
But it could be somebody who knows
you but you don’t necessarily know
them.

TREE
Carter, that’s just dumb. Do you
know how many dozens of people
that could be. I'd spend the rest
of my life dying trying to figure
that out.

Carter snickers.

TREE (CONT'D)
What?

CARTER
You just said you’d have to spend
the rest of your life dying.
(MORE)
77.
CARTER (CONT'D)
It was ironic.
(off Tree’s blank
expression)
Get it...”rest of your life
dying”...
(she’s still not
laughing)
Sorry. I'll shut up now.

They reach Tree’s house. She plops-down on the short wall
and releases an exasperated sigh of defeat.

CARTER (CONT’D)
Can I ask you a dumb question?

TREE
Go for it.

CARTER
Why don’t you just leave the
country?

TREE

Oh, you mean like on my private
jet? I don’t even have a passport.

CARTER
Look, my parents gave me a credit
card for emergencies. You have a
driver’s license, right?

Tree nods.

CARTER (CONT’D)
That’s it, then. We’ll put you on
a plane. Europe. Mexico. Whatever.
By the time you get there it’1ll be
tomorrow. Even if they send you
back cause you don’t have a
passport it’1ll still be the next
day. You’ll be home free!

TREE
(genuinely touched)
You’d...do that for me?

CARTER
My parents will freak when they
get the bill but if it means
keeping you alive...yeah. Of
course.
78.

PRELAP: A HORN beeping...
INT. CARTER’S VW JETTA - DUSK

Carter and Tree are stuck in a long line of cars trailing
back from the interstate on-ramp.

TREE
This is ridiculous. There aren't
even enough people in this stupid
town to make a traffic jam.
(punching the dash)
God, I hate this day!

Carter clears his throat.

CARTER
So, apart from the obvious
reasons, why are you so down on
your birthday?

TREE
I just think it’s dumb.

He looks at her. He's not buying that answer.

TREE (CONT'D)
My mom and I were born on the same
day.

CARTER
And you've had to share it all
your life and it pisses you off?

TREE

No. The opposite. It was always
the best day of the year. I’d get
to skip school, we’d go to the
beach. My dad would get mom and I
this big cake. There was always
just one candle on it. Dad said it
was cause on this one day the
greatest people he knew were born.

(she laughs)
Mom said it was cause the cake
would look like a bonfire if both
our ages were on it.

Her smile fades. Carter sees the sadness in Tree’s eyes.
79.

CARTER
She died, huh?

Tree nods as she shoves her hurt back down.

TREE
Three years ago. Cancer.

CARTER
Sorry. That sucks.

TREE
Yeah, well...that’s life right?
Everybody dies. Some more than
others.

Inching closer to the on-ramp, Tree suddenly sits up in
her seat -- her gaze fixed ahead.

TREE (CONT'D)
Oh my God...

ANGLE ON -- A POLICE OFFICER

Directing the traffic around a small fender-bender, we
immediately recognize him as the SAME COP that pulled
Tree over before.

TREE (CONT'D)
He died...

CARTER
Who?

TREE
It was my fault. I made it happen.

Tree looks stricken with guilt as she watches the cop,
dutifully waving the cars toward the on-ramp --
completely unaware that three cars away, a young girl
he’s never even met has seen him die violently.

TREE (CONT'D)
Turn around.

CARTER
What?!

TREE
Take me back!
80.

CARTER
Tree, I’m getting you out of here!

Reaching over, Tree grabs the steering wheel.
EXT. HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS

The car behind Carter SLAMS on its breaks as Carter’s car
flips a bitch, swerving into oncoming traffic!

Narrowly escaping a major accident, Carter slips into the
flow of traffic heading BACK TOWARDS campus.

CLOSE ON -- THE POLICE OFFICER

Shaking his head disapprovingly as he continues to direct
cars.

INT. CARTER’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

Checking his rear-view mirror, Carter sighs with a mix of
relief and frustration.

CARTER
Are you crazy?!

TREE
Every time I try to run, somebody
dies! Nick, Gregory, that cop! If
I leave who knows how many more
people will die?!

CARTER
So then what?

TREE
I don’t know, okay?! I just...I
don’t know.

Carter turns to look at her. His face is so sympathetic
it clams Tree’s frayed nerves like a salve.

Looking ahead, the horizon is ablaze with a crimson glow
as the school’s BELL TOWER rises above the woods.
Ominous. Foretelling.

TREE (CONT'D)
(softly)

I know one thing...no more

running.
81.

INT. 2ND FLOOR HALLWAY -- KAPPA HOUSE - EVENING

A vexed Danielle bumps into Tree as she exits Tree's
room, holding Tree’s blouse.

DANIELLE
Where were you?
(off Tree’s blank
stare)
You ditched our house meeting.

TREE
Danielle, I’m sorry. I'm
just...going through a lot right
now.

DANIELLE
It’s mandatory, Tree. I just
finished telling your roommate the
same thing. If you guys want to be
Kappa sisters you have to stick to
the schedule or else you're out.

TREE
Then I’m out.

Tree yanks her top out of Danielle’s hands and walks off.
Danielle is floored.

DANIELLE
Have fun back in the dorms!

INT. TREE’S BEDROOM - EVENING

Lori is zipping-up a small bag when Tree enters the room.
As she flops down on the bed, Tree notices the cupcake
sitting on the night stand.

LORI
She just bitch you out too?

TREE
I so could care less.

LORI
You two fighting?

TREE
Danielle and I?
82.

LORI
No, you and Gregory. He asked
where you were. Said you didn’t
show up to his class.

TREE
I can’t even think about that
right now.

LORI
I'm off. I have--

TREE
--a double shift. I know.

LORI
(weird)
Right.

Lori starts out the door but stops. Something is on the
tip of her tongue...but she chickens-out.

LORI (CONT'D)
See ya later.

TREE
Bye.

Lori leaves. Tree lays back down on her bed. Exhaustion
and pain have taken their toll as she easily dozes off.

INT. TREE’S BEDROOM - LATER
Tree wakes up. Looks at the clock...9:19

Danielle bangs on the door before entering in a huff.
She’s all dolled-up sans Tree’s totally cute top.

DANIELLE
Well, it was supposed to be a
surprise but since you’re being a
total bitch I’ve decided to spoil
it. The party at the Sigma house
tonight is a surprise birthday
party for your ungrateful-ass so I
suggest you suck it up and go.
Just don’t even try talking to me
when you’re there. Got it?
83.

Danielle storms out, slamming the door behind her.
Instead of getting upset, Tree grabs the cupcake Lori
made her and peels-off the paper shell. She’s about to
take a bite when...

BLACKOUT.

TREE
(in the dark)
Damn it!

The lights come back on and Tree finds the cupcake
resting upside-down on the floor.

TREE (CONT'D)
So much for that.

Tree picks it up and dumps it in the trash. She turns the
TV on. The “Road Rules Marathon” is still playing.

TREE (CONT'D)
Oh for god’s sake, enough already!

She changes the channel.

The same LOCAL NEWS REPORT is on. But this time, she’s
catching the beginning of the story. Tree instantly
recognizes the HOSPITAL in a WIDESHOT -- it’s the one on
campus.

REPORTER
I'm standing outside Potsdam
University Hospital where
suspected murderer Joseph Tombs is
being treated for a gunshot wound
following a deadly shoot-out this
morning that left one officer
dead.

Tree slowly rises from her bed as they CUT TO Tombs’ mug-
shot.

REPORTER (CONT’D)
Tombs was the subject of a
nationwide manhunt that ended
after a five month pursuit, across
four state lines that left six
known female victims.

(MORE)
84.
REPORTER (CONT’D)
Authorities are still not sure if
Tombs is responsible for the
murders of more than a dozen other
victims he claims to have buried
across the vast deserts of Arizona
and New Mexico.

CLOSE ON -- TREE’S STUNNED FACE

TREE
He’s been here this whole time?

FLASHBACK IN TREE’S MIND: Tree is running from Gregory in
the hospital. As she passes the room where the OFFICER’S
empty chair sat, she catches a split-second glance at the
closed door -- in the tiny, glass window we SEE specks of
BLOOD.

BACK ON TREE -- AS SHE REALIZES

TREE (CONT'D)
Oh my god. He’s going to escape...

INT. 4TH FLOOR -- HOSPITAL - NIGHT

The same NURSE is reading her harlequin novel when Tree
runs up to her station, startling her.

TREE
He’s going to escape! Call the
police!

NURSE
Who?!

TREE

Joseph Tombs! Just call the cops!

Tree runs down the hall -- she catches a GLIMPSE of the
guarding OFFICER as he enters the room!

TREE (CONT'D)
Wait! Don’t go in there!

He didn’t hear her. Tree spots a FIRE AXE mounted on the
wall. She retrieves it and approaches Tombs’ room.

Behind her the nurse calls after Tree:

NURSE
Excuse me! What are you doing?
85.

Tree ignores her and enters the room.
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The first thing Tree sees is the empty hospital bed with
a pair of ARM RESTRAINTS dangling from the guard rails.

Moving deeper into the room, Tree discovers the OFFICER'S
BODY lying on the other side of the bed. His throat has
been slit, his GUN is missing from its holster.

TOMBS (0.C.)
(Southern drawl)
Hey...

Tree turns around and finds her killer standing behind
her.

TOMBS (CONT'D)

That's a pretty big axe you got

there, little girl.
Tombs raises the officer’s stolen handgun. Tree starts to
swing the axe -- Tombs fires twice! Both bullets ricochet
off the blade, knocking the axe out of Tree’s grip.
Tree: Oh shit.
Tree bolts for the door! Tombs goes after her!
INT. 4TH FLOOR -- HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS

Running out the door, Tree slams into the nurse.

NURSE
What are you--

TREE
Run!

Tree tries to grab her but the nurse pauses to peer into
the room.

BAM-BAM-BAM!

Three rapid-fire shots take the nurse down. Tree screams
and runs for the elevators. She sees another NURSE in the
hall -- she bolts for the elevator. By the time Tree
reaches her, the elevator doors are already closing!
86.

TREE (CONT'D)
WAIT!

Too late! The doors close on Tree. Tombs rounds the
corner. Tree is trapped in the small reception area. He
laughs -- cold-blooded and mocking.

Backed against the elevator doors, Tree watches
helplessly as Tombs advances, gun raised and ready to
fire!

Suddenly, Carter appears BEHIND Tombs. He tackles Tombs --
the gun goes off twice before falling from his grip!

Tree is quick to grab the gun. She aims at Tombs and
fires!

CLICK...
Tree’s eyes widen in horror. It’s empty.

Without missing a beat, Tombs pulls a hunting knife
tucked away and drives the blade into Carter!

TREE (CONT'D)
Carter!!!

He’s dead. Tree backpedals away from the elevator as
Tombs rises to his feet.

Tree turns and runs down another CORRIDOR. It dead-ends
at a door marked “STAIRS”.

INT. STAIRWELL -- BELL TOWER - CONTINUOUS

Assuming it was another fire-exit, Tree discovers the
stairs only go up...

...toward the BELL TOWER.

Tombs bursts through the door!

Tree races up the wooden steps of this small, cramped
stairwell (metal candle holders line the wall) -- Tombs
is close behind! He lunges --

-- when Tree reaches back and KICKS him hard in the gut!
He slips back a few steps! She kicks him again -- square

in the face, shattering part of the mask -- exposing half
of Tombs demented grin.
87.

Catching her ankle, he yanks her hard and she nearly
tumbles atop him!

Tree’s kicking at him, but his grip is iron clad.

Tombs snaps a metal candle stick from the wall --
prepared to stab her with the jagged metal edge! He
brings it down hard, Tree dodges the blow as the pointed
edge jams into the soft wood of the stair!

Tree seizes the moment and CLAWS his face as hard she
can. Tombs screams in agony! Wriggling out from under
him, Tree clamors for the entrance to the bell tower.
INT. BELL TOWER - CONTINUOUS

Moments later, Tombs steps into the loft.

He looks, where could she have gone? There’s no way out.
Tree is standing on the railing.

He’s confused. She’s three flights up.

He notices the rope leading from the bell tower...

-..is tied around her neck.

She turns, glares him in the eye.

TREE
See you tomorrow, asshole.

She leaps!

In mid-air, the rope pulls taught! The bell rings out as
we...

SLAM CUT:
INT. CARTER’S DORM ROOM - MORNING
Outside, the bell is still tolling as Tree’s eyes snap
open. She sucks in a breath of air and exhales with a
wheeze. Tree looks pale -- we don’t know how many more
“lives” she’s got left.

But her eyes are filled with purpose. She knows who her
killer is and she’s not afraid anymore.

Tree sits up and sees Carter staring at her.
88.

CARTER
You’re up. I wasn’t --

Weak but elated to see him alive, Tree jumps out of bed
and throws her arms around Carter.

TREE
Thank you! I can’t believe you
tried to save me!

Carter’s body is rigid in Tree’s awkward embrace. He
finally pats her back cordially.

CARTER
No biggie.
She pulls away as her cell phone plays “Happy Birthday”.
By the time she retrieves it, she’s missed her dad’s
call.

TREE
Damn it.

Tree pulls her T-shirt off. Carter spins around.

CARTER
I don’t know if you remember my
name --

TREE
Carter.

He looks surprised. Tree grabs a pillow from his bed.

TREE (CONT'D)
Can I borrow this?

CARTER
Uh...sure. Why not?

TREE
Thanks.

She pecks him on the cheek.

TREE (CONT'D)
See you at lunch.

Now he’s really confused but before he can even ask she’s
already starting out the door. The freshman is just
arriving. As she passes him, Tree SLAPS his ass.
89.

The freshman looks at Carter -- WIF?
Cue a hot song with a nice beat...
EXT. THE CAMPUS - MORNING

A walk of shame no more, Tree ditches her heels and
chucks them in the bushes before strutting down the main
thoroughfare.

Sun in her eyes, Tree casually snatches a pair of
SUNGLASSES off a passerby and puts them on. He spins
around and watches Tree keep going, too shocked to
protest.

She comes across the PROTESTER...

STUDENT PROTESTER
Stop global--

Tree grabs the clipboard out of her hand and signs the
petition. She shoves it back into the protester’s hands,
adding:

TREE
I love Al Gore.

Next stop, the frat pledges...

FRAT PLEDGES
-- not a Willie or a Sam! I’m the
eighth ole’ man named Henry!
Henry the Eighth, I am!

FRAT BROTHER
Second verse, same as the first!

FRAT PLEDGES
Oh, Henry the Eighth, I am, I
am!...

The EXHAUSTED FRAT PLEDGE starts to go down, but his fall
is broken by Tree. She gently lays him down and sticks
the pillow under his head. He’s already out like a light
as Tree plants a kiss on his forehead.

A hush has fallen over the cheering crowd of onlookers.
Tree doesn’t pay any attention to them as she keeps
going.
90.

Reaching the end of the quad, Tree starts down the steps.
She sees Keith up ahead and waves to him.

TREE
Morning Keith!

He almost has a heart attack as she gives him a bear hug.

TREE (CONT'D)
Have a great day.

KEITH
Thanks?

As he watches Tree go, his confused expression yields to
a smitten grin.

INT. KAPPA DELTA HOUSE - MORNING
Starting up the stairs, Tree is accosted by Danielle.

DANIELLE
Oh-my-god. You sneaky beeyotch!

Tree turns around.

TREE
(rapid-fire)
His name’s Carter. We didn’t have
sex. But I think if I get through
this, I might have his children.
Lots to do. Gotta go.

Tree’s really racking-up the baffled expressions today.
INT. TREE’S BEDROOM - MORNING

Dressed and ready for the biggest day of her life, Tree
smiles as Lori exits the bathroom.

LORI
She finally rolls-in.

TREE
Lori, I’m late for class but I
wanted to say that I’m sorry for
being such a shitty roommate. I
know you’ve been seeing somebody
and you couldn’t even talk about
it with me and that’s wrong. I
should have been there for you.

(MORE )
91.

TREE (CONT'D)
But I want to change that.
Starting today.

LORI
Are you okay?

Tree smiles.

TREE
Never better.

INT. DR. BUTLER’S SCIENCE CLASS - MORNING
Late for class, Tree enters the lecture hall. The door
squeaks open, drawing everyone’s attention -- including
Gregory's as he turns from the chalkboard.

Only Tree doesn’t sit down.

TREE
Dr. Butler...a word please?

INT. HALLWAY -- OUTSIDE GREGORY’S CLASS - MOMENTS LATER

Tree is already waiting outside as Gregory practically
explodes out of the lecture hall.

GREGORY
What the hell do you think you're
doing?!
TREE
Ending this.
GREGORY
Wait. What?
TREE

I wish I’d never started seeing
you. It was wrong. Anyway, I can’t
change that. But I can start doing
the right thing today.

Gregory laughs -- it’s smug and condescending.

GREGORY
What lame self-help book did that
come from?

TREE
You know something, you have a
wife who really loves you.
(MORE)
92.
TREE (CONT'D)
If you can’t be committed to her
then have the balls to leave her.

That shut him up. Tree starts off.

GREGORY
(shouting after her)
Don’t expect me to let you coast-
by in my class now!

TREE
(laughing)
I already dropped it!

She flips him the bird before disappearing out the door.
EXT. LUNCH PATIO - AFTERNOON

The Kappa lunch meeting is in full swing. Danielle is
holding court when she sees Tree approach the table with
a tray FULL of junk food. She sets it down and instantly
dives-into a wedge of cheesecake. Everyone is staring at
her like she’s a leper.

TREE
(mouth-full)
This is totally amazing.

Becky arrives with her tray -- including a sandwich,
pasta salad, and the notorious glass of chocolate milk.
As she sits down...

DANIELLE
Did I miss the memo?
BECKY
Sorry?
DANIELLE
What’s up with the fat-fest? We’re
Kappa’s.

Tree shoves her plate of cheesecake toward Danielle.

TREE
Live a little, hon. A few calories
won’t kill you.

DANIELLE
No, they’1l just turn me into a
chunker like Becky here.
93.

Becky looks like she’s going to die. She starts to get up
with her tray of food. She doesn’t see Carter coming.

SMASH!

They collide. Only this time, Tree’s ready as she nimbly
ducks out of the way. Becky’s chocolate milk flies off
the tray and splashes all over Danielle!

Tree cracks up!

CARTER
Oh my god! I’m so sorry!

TREE
Don’t be. That was perfect.

Becky starts laughing with Tree. Danielle gets up. As
more people see her dripping wet they start laughing too.

DANIELLE
Shut up!

Her tantrum only makes them laugh harder. Bursting into
tears, Danielle runs off with some of her Kappa cronies
chasing after her.

CARTER
I didn’t mean to--

Tree grabs him and plants a big kiss on his lips. She
finally pulls away. Carter’s eyes are as wide as saucers.

CARTER (CONT’D)
What was that for?

“Happy Birthday” starts playing again on Tree’s cell
phone. It’s dad again.

TREE
Look, I have to run but what are
you up to tonight?

CARTER
Um...nothing.

TREE
Would you like to take me out for
my birthday?
94,

CARTER
Okay. What’s the punch-line?

TREE
I’m being serious. I know it’s
kinda random but I’1l explain
everything tomorrow assuming there
is one. Just say yes.

CARTER
Yes?

Tree pecks him on the cheek. As she heads off, Carter
looks at Becky -- they both share confused grins.

INT. RESTAURANT - AFTERNOON

Tree’s dad, DAVID (late 40’s, distinguished), sits in the
half-empty restaurant -- an empty coffee cup in front of
him.

He looks at his watch with a sigh before waving the
WAITRESS over to his table.

DAVID
Can I pay for my coffee?

WAITRESS
You’re not going to eat, honey?

DAVID
No. Thanks. Just the check.

The waitress leaves. David fishes out his wallet and
removes a ten. But when he looks up, he finds Tree
standing there.

TREE
Hi, daddy. Sorry I’m late.

Tree takes a seat across from him. She can tell he’s
hurt.

TREE (CONT'D)
You look nice. I like the tie.

David looks down at his tie.

DAVID
Thanks.
95.

An uncomfortable silence fills the air. Tree looks down,
ashamed she’s let the distance between them get this far.

DAVID (CONT'D)
How’s school?

TREE
It's fine. Dad, I don’t want to do
that anymore.

DAVID
Do what?

TREE
You know...small talk.

David looks surprised by her forthrightness.

TREE (CONT'D)
This day...it’s so hard. I miss
her so much. And I thought if I
just avoided it -- and you, it’d
be easier. But it’s worse. All
this running and hiding has made
me so unhappy. I think I finally
figured it out. It took something
crazy for me to get it. But I’m
here and I love you and--

(she chokes up)
I’m so sorry for hurting you.

Tree’s dad looks visibly moved. Tree wipes her own tears
away. David takes her hand and kisses it.

DAVID
Happy Birthday, baby.

TREE
Thanks daddy.

NEW SHOT -- FROM ACROSS THE ROOM

We SEE Tree and David engaged in conversation. Picking-up
where they left off three years ago.

INT. TREE’S BEDROOM - EVENING
We’re CLOSE ON a chef’s KNIFE as Tree slides it into the

back of her jeans before hiding the handle with a tight T-
shirt.
96.

Pulling her hair back into a pony tail, she glances at
her reflection in the mirror. Her eyes say all we need to
know...she’s ready to take control of her destiny.

Teresa Gelbman is going to make it to Wednesday, the
19th.

Even if it kills her.
INT. 4TH FLOOR -- HOSPITAL - NIGHT

We follow Lori as she comes down the hall -- she passes
the nurse’s station where our hopeless romantic (the same
nurse every night) has her face buried in the harlequin
novel.

LORI
Deena, I’m taking my break. Back
in a few.

The nurse doesn’t look up. She just answers with a “K”.

Lori steps into the elevator. As the doors close, we see
the adjacent doors open revealing Tree.

Our heroine slips by the nurse’s station. Much to her
relief, she finds the OFFICER just sitting down outside
Tomb’s room with his hot cup of coffee.

Tree quietly approaches him. He looks up at her,
surprised.

POLICE OFFICER
Help you?

Tree brings a finger to her mouth, shushing him.

TREE
(whispering)
This is going to sound crazy, but
Joseph Tombs is going to escape
tonight.

POLICE OFFICER
(you crazy?)
Come again?

TREE
Please. Just check on him.
97.

POLICE OFFICER
Look, I don’t know who you are,
missy, but you better turn around
and high-tail it out of here
before I have you thrown out.

He doesn’t even see it coming. Tree has the blade at his
throat before the officer can get the gun from his
holster.

TREE
I’m really sorry but you’re just
gonna have to do what I say right
now.

POLICE OFFICER
(scared)
Okay. Take it easy. Take it easy.

TREE
Now stand up very slowly.

He does as he’s told.

POLICE OFFICER
This is a real bad idea.

TREE

So's getting killed for the sixth
time. Open the door.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Guiding the officer into the room, Tree’s relieved to
find Tomb’s still asleep in his bed.

POLICE OFFICER
See? Safe and sound.

She nudges the officer closer.

POLICE OFFICER (CONT’D)
Look, he’s not--

TREE
Shoot him.

POLICE OFFICER
What?!
98.

TREE
Shoot him in the head.

They both don’t see Tomb’s eyes slowly open...

POLICE OFFICER
Girly, you are out of your
freakin’ mind!

CLOSE ON -- TOMB’S ARM RESTRAINTS

His wrists are just resting in them but the straps are
already UNDONE.

TREE
He’s going to kill me! Shoot him!

Tombs suddenly LUNGES at the cop and shoves the knife he
was hiding into the police officer’s stomach!

Tree staggers back as Tombs rises from his bed. He picks
up the MASK sitting on the table beside his bed.

Tree grabs the fallen officer’s GUN! She aims it at Tombs
and squeezes the trigger! Nothing happens!

TOMBS
The safety's still on little
girl...

The blood covered Tombs throws his full weight atop her!
She goes down hard -- shattering a rib! The gun sails
across the room from the impact!

He drops the knife, climbing atop her, choking her with
his bare hands!

TOMBS (CONT'D)
I should cut off your head and be
done with it... but this feels so
much better, no?

But this isn’t the weak and defenseless Tree who has been
killed again and again. She focuses --

-- and drives her open palm hard into his nose! He cries
out in pain. Tree tries to run but he grabs her by her
shirt and throws her across the room! Tree hits the wall
like a rag doll.
99,

Tombs retrieves the knife and slowly stalks over to Tree.
She’s in too much pain to move.

He he stands above her, the knife in the air. Tombs
flashes a sadistic grin.

But he’s surprised...

..-when she smiles back?!

9:23. Blackout.

Moments pass.

The lights come back on.

He is surprised that Tree... is gone?!

TREE
Psst.

No, not gone. She took advantage of the blackout to
scramble a few feet away and pick up the gun.

TREE (CONT'D)
Thanks for the tip.

.--and as he lunges at her, knife in hand...
.-.-she empties the gun into his chest!
Tombs falls back onto the bed, a bloody mess. DEAD.

We HOLD ON Tree -- exhausted but still alive. A victim no-
more.

DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. KAPPA DELTA HOUSE - NIGHT

The police have gone, the ordeal is finally over. Carter
is walking Tree to her house.

CARTER
So this has to be strangest
birthday you've ever had.

TREE
You have no idea.
100.

CARTER
Did the police say how Tombs got
free?
TREE
They really don’t know.
CARTER
Like Houdini.
TREE

I guess.
They stop outside her front door.

TREE (CONT'D)
So, sorry our little date didn’t

happen.

CARTER
It’s okay. There’s always
tomorrow.

Tree glances at her watch. It’s 11:53 pm.
TREE
(under her breath)
I hope so.
She kisses him.

TREE (CONT'D)
Good night.

CARTER
Night.

She goes inside. Carter lingers for a moment, totally
smitten.

INT. TREE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Tree’s a little surprised to find the room empty. Lori
must be out with her “new man”.

But she left something behind...
THE CUPCAKE.

Tree grabs a book of matches sitting on a box of incense.
She lights the candle on the cupcake.
101.

Sitting down on her bed, Tree closes her eyes. Thinking
of a wish.

Love? Money? Fame?

Doesn’t matter. She’s alive.
Tree opens her eyes and blows.
CLOSE ON -- THE WICK

As the flame is extinguished by Tree’s breath we are
plunged into DARKNESS.

SLAM CUT:

THREE BEATS OF DARKNESS MAKE US THINK OUR STORY HAS ENDED
BUT...

THE TOWER BELL TOLLS THE HOUR...

Tree’s eyes flutter open. She’s a little groggy. Pushing
herself up, her eyes suddenly fill with an unspeakable
horror!

INT. CARTER’S DORM ROOM - MORNING

Carter is putting something under the couch when he
notices Tree sitting up in his bed. He smiles.

CARTER
You’re up. I wasn’t --

TREE
Carter...

CARTER

I didn’t think you’d remember my
name. You were pretty wasted last
night.

Tree’s cell phone plays “Happy Birthday”. She grabs the
phone...the caller ID says “DAD”.

TREE
No...this can’t happening! This
can’t be happening!

She jumps out of bed.
102.

TREE (CONT'D)
I killed him!

CARTER
(alarmed)
Who? What are you talking about?
She pulls her T-shirt off. Carter spins around.
CARTER (CONT’D)
You probably just had a bad dream.
It happens to me whenever I drink
too much.
But when he turns around, Tree’s already gone. He frowns.
CARTER (CONT’D)
(to himself)
Nice one, dickweed.
EXT. THE CAMPUS - MORNING
Tears streaking down her cheeks, Tree runs past
everything familiar. Nothing has changed. She’s trapped
in the same day forever...
INT. TREE’S BEDROOM - MORNING

We can HEAR the shower running through the bathroom door
as a border-line hysterical Tree enters.

She immediately begins pulling clothes from her drawer
and tossing them on the bed.

The water stops as Lori emerges from the bathroom wrapped
in a towel.

LORI
Oh. She’s finally back.

Lori notices the pile of clothes building on Tree’s bed.

LORI (CONT'D)
Going somewhere?

TREE
Yes! As far away as possible!

LORI
What’s wrong?
103.

TREE
What’s wrong?! I’1ll tell you
what’s wrong! Me! I was wrong! I
thought if I stopped running I
could beat it! But it’s never
going to stop! So I’ll run! I’1l
run to the end of the god-damn
earth if I have to!

LORI
Tree, you’re freaking me out.

TREE
Oh well! That’s me! A freak!

Tree yanks the closet open, searching for something.

LORI
Tree, look...

She turns around. Lori’s holding the cupcake she made for
Tree.

LORI (CONT'D)
Happy Birthday.

TREE
(sarcastic)
Thanks, but I already ate it last
night--

Tree freezes. Last night...

She turns around to face her roommate -- her eyes locked
on the cupcake.

TREE (CONT'D)
I died in my sleep.

LORI
What?

TREE
You...killed me.

Lori slowly sets the cupcake down on Tree’s desk.

TREE (CONT'D)
(working it out;
aloud)

(MORE)
104.
TREE (CONT'D)

It was poisoned. But I never ate
it before.

FLASH: We SEE Tree throwing the cupcake in the trash --
then dropping it on the floor after the black out.

TREE (CONT'D)
So you had to find another way.
Then Tombs fell right into your
lap...the perfect scapegoat.

FLASH: Tombs is rolled past Lori on a gurney. She follows
him with narrowed eyes as a plot is hatched in her mind.

TREE (CONT'D)
You had access to him. Did you
drug him first?

FLASH: Lori jams a hypordermic needle in Tombs’ arm.
While he’s unconscious, she changes him into “The
Killer’s Outfit”. She puts the MASK on his face and sets
the HUNTER’S KNIFE at his side. As she slips out of the
room, we SEE his wrists are no longer restrained.

TREE (CONT'D)
You knew he'd wake up and escape.
Then they'd just assume he killed
me.

FLASH: Tree’s FIRST DEATH. The masked killer stabs her
from behind.

TREE (CONT'D)
But it was always you...

 

FLASH: The killer pulls-up his mask REVEALING Lori’s
satisfied/hateful expression as she looks down on Tree’s
lifeless body in the ditch.

BACK TO TREE'S BEDROOM:
Lori’s stunned expression yields to a sardonic laugh.
LORI
You’ve totally lost your mind. You
actually think I’d try to poison

you with a friggin’ cupcake?

TREE
Prove it.

Tree nods to the cupcake.
105.

TREE (CONT'D)
Have a bite.

Lori hesitates. Tree picks it up.

TREE (CONT'D)
Go ahead...

LORI
You really are nuts.

TREE
Fine. I'll just take it to the
police. I’m sure they can see what
your little birthday treat is made
of.

Lori’s expression falls. As Tree turns, Lori grabs Tree
by the hair! The cupcake falls on the desk! Lori swings
Tree into the wall! Tree hits the ground, dazed.

Lori slams the bedroom door shut and locks it. Blocking
the door, she looks down on Tree.

LORI
(with venom)
You stupid little whore.

TREE
Why?..

LORI
Oh, I don’t know. Maybe because
you wouldn't stop sleeping with
him.

TREE
Gregory?

LORI
But he kept choosing you over me.
Guess all he really wanted was a
cheap slut like you. But what I
want to know is...how did you
figure it out?

TREE
You’ve killed me before.
106.

LORI
Then I guess I'll just have to do
it again.

Tree runs for the window but Lori tackles her! She flips
Tree over. Grabbing her by the hair, Lori begins BASHING
her head against the floor.

Suddenly, there’s a loud KNOCK at the door...

Lori stops for a second and immediately covers Tree's
mouth with her hand.

DANIELLE (0.S.)
What the hell's going on in there?

LORI
Everything's fine...Tree just
fell. She’s okay.

In her peripheral, Tree SPOTS the up-turned cupcake lying
on the desk -- just an arm’s length away...

Lori suddenly becomes aware of Tree grabbing the cupcake.
With her other hand, Tree PUNCHES Lori in the throat!

Lori gasps for air!

TREE
Eat it, bitch!

And Tree crams the cupcake into Lori’s open mouth!

As Lori struggles to spit the cake out, Tree SLUGS her
again, knocking Lori off.

Tree gets to her feet fast. Lori rises, spitting the last
bits out.

LORI
Oh, you're dead now...

Looking up, Tree spies a built-in BOOKSHELF over the
window where Lori is standing.

With the last of her strength, Tree JUMPS UP and catches
the shelf with both hands then KICKS Lori through the
window!
107.

EXT. KAPPA DELTA HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Glass and wood EXPLODE as Lori sails though the window!
Her body bounces off the ledge, before flipping over
backwards!

There’s a skull-crushing THUD as Lori hits the stone
walkway two-stories below.

INT. TREE’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Danielle’s door-pounding has intensified with all the
commotion.

DANIELLE (0.S.)
What the hell was that?

ANGLE ON TREE -- BATTERED AND FADING
TREE
(winded)

Lori...ate...my birthday cupcake.
We can HEAR some of the sorority sister’s SCREAMS outside
as Tree’s eyes roll back into her head and she passes out
cold.
FADE IN:
EXT. POTSDAM UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL - MORNING

It is a beautiful, sunny morning.

Half a dozen LOCAL and NATIONAL NEWS VANS parked out
front, all covering the story of the day.

INT. INTENSIVE CARE WARD - MORNING

Tree wakes up in the hospital bed. Beside her is Carter
and her dad.

TREE
What... day is it?

DAVID
Wednesday, you slept all night.

TREE
Wednesday? The nineteenth?
108.

DAVID
That’s right.

TREE
(relieved)
I made it.
She smiles... starts to get up, but can’t.
CARTER
You're not supposed to move.
You've been banged up pretty bad.
She lets them lower her back down.

CARTER (CONT’D)
Do you remember anything?

TREE
Lori? She’s dead?

He shakes his head.
DAVID
The police know everything. They
found her journal.

She takes Carter’s hand. Then her Dad’s. Tree is
grateful. Just then, Dr. Winter appears.

DR. WINTER
She needs her rest. You can visit
her later.

DAD
I love you.

TREE
I love you, too.

As dad starts off, Carter steals a little kiss, adding:

CARTER
You still owe me a date.

Tree smiles.
They leave. Alone with Dr. Winter: Tree winces.

TREE
Can I get something for the pain?
109.

DR. WINTER
In your condition, I’m afraid
anything I would prescribe could
be dangerous. You might need to
put up with some pain for a day --
can you do that?
Tree smiles.

TREE
I can handle one day. Believe me.

Dr. Winter excuses himself.

Tree closes her eyes, soaking in the sunlight of this new
day, pouring through the window --

-- when she’s suddenly aware of a shadow over her.

She sees the silhouette of a nurse standing over her.
The woman is preparing a syringe.

Tree raises her hand to try to get a look at the nurse.

TREE (CONT'D)
Excuse me. What are you doing?

NURSE
It’s for the pain.

The nurse brings the syringe to the I.V. tube.

TREE
But... the doctor said no.
The nurse steps closer...
It's Stephanie -- Gregory's wife.
STEPHANIE

Not your pain, Teresa. Mine. Did
you think you’d get away with
screwing my husband?

Stephanie empties the syringe in the intravenous.

TREE
You’ve got to be kidding me.
110.

..-whispers Tree, even as she begins to convulse...
SLAM CUT:

END CREDITS

*ALTERNATE ENDING*

INT. CARTER’S DORM ROOM - MORNING

The bell tolls outside. Tree stirs from her slumber. She
sits up...notices she’s wearing the same oversized T-

shirt.

TREE
No...

She spies Carter -- bent over, in front of the couch
putting something away.

Tree’s eyes go wide with shock as her cell phone plays
“Happy Birthday”. She grabs it...

CLOSE ON -- THE LCD SCREEN

It says: PRIVATE NUMBER

Tree: What?

Carter turns around, holding his cell phone. He laughs as
he snaps it shut. Tree’s cell phone instantly stops

ringing as she realizes he was just fucking with her.

TREE (CONT'D)
You think that’s funny?!

CARTER
Hilarious.

Grabbing a pillow, Tree takes a swing and misses. Carter
tackles Tree onto the bed. Pinning her down, he goes in

for the kiss...

But Tree suddenly pushes him back -- she looks worried.

CARTER (CONT’D)
What’s wrong?
111.
TREE
What if I get stuck in this day?
Carter kisses her. It’s passionate but tempered with
sweetness. He pulls away. A smiles breaks through Tree’s

anxiety.

TREE (CONT'D)
I guess I could live with that.

Tree grabs Carter’s head and pulls him into another kiss.

Cue love-song that makes teenage girls prematurely
ovulate as we PULL AWAY from our lovebirds...

EXT. HOSPITAL BELL TOWER - MORNING

The bell rings one last time as the sun rises over the
Potsdam University campus -- its incandescent light
finally keeping its promise of tomorrow.

FADE OUT.
