OUT OF DARKNESS
Fade up a title card:

in 1883 the voicano on the Indonesian island
of Krakatoa erupted, showering the world
with dust. As this debris fell slowly to earth,
it led to a number of strange atmospheric
effects. In 1888 the city of London
witnessed increasingly bizarre sunsets -
@reen and blood red skies. Contemporary
accounts describe it as an unusually

lightlass year. In retrospect, it seems
entirely appropriate...

Whoosh! The screen erupts in orange and red flame. We pull back to reveal -

A STREET VENDOR

fires up a brazier, starting to roast chestnuts and squirrels over the flames. Unseen
by him, two urchins crouch under the barrow, trying to capture some of the
warmth. It's dusk - a blood red sky turns to purple as night falls.

Silhouetted against it is a grim and awful church. The massive portico and tower are
deliberately out of proportion, designed to instill a sense of fear in those who enter.
its name is Christchurch and it stands in the heart of Whitechapel.

This is the armpit of London - grim Victorian tenements, dark alleys and lanes, 8
filthy pub on every corner. The streets sre crowded with the poor and desperate.
Scores of prostitutes, ranging in age from the early teens to the late 40's, work the
sidewalks and alleys, looking for trade.

A SHOP WINDOW

throws a wedge of light across Dorset Street. Several prostitutes look in at the
cheap bonnets and shoes. Among them is a woman in her early 20's - she's poorly
dressed, shy looking. Her face is beautiful - she has auburn hair that falls to her
shoulders and large bright eyes. Her name is Mary Kelly. Like the other women, she
is tired and hungry - trying to make a living the only way she can.

An unshaven bear of 8 man approaches. Under his jacket he wears 6 feather apron -
he's a butcher. Despite his appearance, several of the women put on their most
attractive smiles. None of them can afford to be choosy.

The butcher eyes the women up and down, appraising them. Then he sees Mary
and smiles.

BUTCHER
New around here, ain't you?

MARY

(quietly)
A couple of weeks, that's all...

BUTCHER
What's the fare then?

MARY
Eight pence. Six pence for me and
tuppence for 3 room.
BUTCHER
Eight pence for the hour? | can't afford
to travel that far. Anything for less?

MARY
A three-penny upright is the cheapest.

BUTCHER
What's an upright, missy?

MARY
There's a lane ‘round the back - you do
it up against the wall.
The Butcher looks around - a narrow alley leads between two tenements.

BUTCHER
{t's dark, is it?

MARY
Dark enough.

He smiles at her - then reaches up and rings an imaginary bell.

BUTCHER
Ding! Ding! All aboard,

Mary turns and leads him into the alley.

A SADDLE MAKER'S YARD

Mary and the Butcher move through the shadows behind the tenements - a
workshop and stables form a courtyard. Alleys and passageways run off of it.
Another prostitute enters the courtyard. In her 30's with raven hair and eyes like jet,
she looks sassy - a half open blouse and a pert bonnet tied under her chin. This is
Annie Chapman - Dark Annie to her friends.

MARY
Hello Annie. -

Dark Annie can't see clearly in the gloom. She comes forward, peering -

MARY
It's Mary... Mary Kelly.

DARK ANNIE
Hello, Mary. How's tricks? If you're going
to Dutfield Yard be careful - there's a
drunk fallen down in the doorway.

MARY
Thanks, Annie.

As they go their separate ways, we crane up: the slums behind the tenements
stretch forever - a maze of allays, broken down hovels and towering walls.

DARK ANNIE

steps into a covered passageway littered with garbege. Smiling, she starts to play
hopscotch over the trash.

DARK ANNIE
One, two, buckle my shoe. Three, four
shut the door...

A man steps into frame. Silently, he watches Dark Annie from behind. In his hand
he carries a knife. Annie skips forward, into -

A MARKET YARD

it's deserted now - empty barrows and wagons line the walls, blocking the only exit.
Dark Annie curses at having to retrace her steps. She turns - straight into the man!
He slashes with the knife! It cuts straight across her throat - her bonnet flutters to
the ground.

Annie keeps staring at the man. Oh, he's good with the blade - he's cut the bonnet
clean off her chin and not even scratched the skin. He pulls her face close to his.
He's 8 young man - dead eyes and e cruel smile.

Annie, isn’t it? Dark Annie Chapman?
DARK ANNIE

It...if.. it's money you want, I'm.. I've only got

a shilling. If it's t’other... |... I'll do it here.
GEORDIE

Time enough for pleasure later. It's
business first.

He jerks her head back, laying open her throat and breasts. A sound behind Annie.
She rolls her eyes back - two men emerge from the shadows and stand at back of
her. One of them is obviously the leader. This is McQueen.

McQUEEN
We come from Old Nichol Street. Maybe
you've heard of us?

Annie nods her head - yes.

McQUEEN
The girls up the other end of Whitechape!
like us, Annie. We keep an eye on the
streets, make sure there's no trouble,
you know the sort of thing. Now a fine
service like that doesn't come free, does
it? The girls have to pay, and nota
shilling, either.

DARK ANNIE
How much?

McQUEEN
Every girl, @ pound a week each.

DARK ANNIE
A pound?! There’s no hope -

McQUEEN
That doesn't sound like enthusiasm.
What a shame.

{to Geordie)
Do it!

Geordie clamps his hand over Annie's mouth and slashes the knife across her
exposed breasts. Annie's face crumples in pain - she slumps in his arms. McQueen
puts his face close.

McQUEEN
We like you, Annie - that's why we chose
you. You're a good looking girl and you
work hard. Now if we do that to someone
we like, just imagine what we'll do to
someone who gives us trouble. Tell that
to the other girls, will you? We'll be round
come Friday for the money.

Geordie lets go of her. She falls to the ground. The men vanish into the shadows.

THREE PENNIES

are thrown to the ground. We are in Dutfield's Yard, a small and shadowy area next
10 a warehouse. Mary bends and picks up the money. The Butcher pulls aside his
apron, getting ready to take her. A sound in the shadows, sort of like a gasping -
Annie staggers into the yard, clutching her blouse across her chest.

DARK ANNIE
(softly)
Mary... I've been cut, Mary.

Mary goes to her - she sees the blood covering Annie's blouse.
MARY
Sweet Jesus...
{to the butcher)
Help us - c'mon she needs help.

The man backs away, doing up his fly -

BUTCHER
‘came here for some twat - i don’t want
any trouble.
MARY

For Chrissakes, the girl's bleeding!

He turns and runs. Siam! He trips over something lying in the doorway - it's the
drunk. The Butcher scrambles to his feet and keeps running.

MARY
Men... bloody men!

She cradles Annie in her arms and yells for help. The sound carries across the slums
of Dorset Street. A couple of lanterns come on -

THE RINGERS

is 8 down-at-heel pub on the corner of Dorset and Crispin Streets. It's real name - as
it still is today - is The Britannia. The nickname comes from the proprietoss - Walter
Ringer and his wife. Annie lies on a couch, a sheet draped from the rafters gives a
little privacy from the drinkers. The wound across her chest has just been bandaged.

The loca! Doctor washes the blood and iodine from his hands. Two policemen, Mary
and several other more experienced prostitutes watch -

DOCTOR LEWELLYN
{It'll heal, well enough. She just needs
to bathe it every day - no doubt that'll
come as quite a shock. I've left some
laudanum for the pain.

He packs his equipment into his bag. Annie reaches in to her purse and drops a
couple of pennies in his hand - that's all the money she's got. The Doctor looks at
the other women, waiting. They all contribute - Mary pulls out the three soiled
pennies and hands it over.

DOCTOR LEWELLYN
Glad to be of service. Good night, ladies.

He steps through the sheet. The senior policeman turns to Annie -

SERGEANT
I need to get a statement from you.

DARK ANNIE
What - and it'll be my throat that's cut
tomorrow? No, thank you, Sergeant.
There's laws down here in the East End,
but they're not made by coppers.

Several of the other prostitutes nod in agreement.

SERGEANT
Do you want our help or not?

One of the women laughs. This is Polly Nichols. She's 8 good hearted woman in her
late 20's. A crooked smile gives her a cock-eyed, impish look -

POLLY
Help - you? Since when has anyone
given a shit about us? We're poor and
we're women. There's never a copper
ground when we need one.

You just come round and pick up the

what you are.

SERGEANT
And what do you call something that
fucks in the street? A bitch, that's what

(turns to the constable)
Write it down, Charlie - she tripped and
fell on a piece of glass. Accidental injury.

He picks up his jacket, turns and walks out.

A MAGNIFICENT HOUSE

it’s a grand Nash-designed terrace in Belgravia - all pillars and balustrades. Through
@ huge window we see a sparkling chandelier -

IN THE DRAWING ROOM

are about thirty people - men in black tie, the women in satin and jewels. It's after
dinner and the butler serves drinks and cigars. A man near the fireplace turns and
takes a brandy balloon. He's in his early 30’s, handsome, a little out of his depth in
such glittering company. But there's a strength about him, a cool intelligence in his
eyes that makes you feel if there was trouble you'd want him on your side. This is
Fred Abberline.

On the other side of the room is Sir Charles Warren, the Commissioner of Police. He
is in his 60's, gray-haired, strong in appearance but week in character. He is talking
to a big elderly woman, dressed in layers of cream silk. She looks like a galleon in
full sail -

LADY ROSSIE
And this Mr Abberline, Sir Charles - you
say he's a Detective Inspector or
something. Tell me, what brings a man
like him to the attention of the Police
Commissioner?

SIR CHARLES
Have you ever been to Whitechapel,
m'lady?

LADY ROSSIE
Good God, no.

SIR CHARLES
\ don't recommend it. There's seventy
thousand people crammed into five
square miles. Unemployment is over
sixty per cent - and that's among the
men. There's nothing for the women,
nothing at all, not unless you count
‘Starvation of a profession which good
manners precludes me from mentioning.
The Black Hole of Calcutta - it's here, in
the heart of London. Imagine the sort of
man that has brought at least some order
to it. That's Inspector Abberline. He's an
outstanding officer, m'lady.

LADY ROSSIE
{smiling)

Apparently so. And now you're going to
turn him loose on us wicked dowagers
of Belgravia? Of course, this place is full
of crime, too, but as everybody knows -
up here we at least have the good taste
to keep it behind closed doors. Don't you
think your Inspector may be a trifle bored?

SIR CHARLES
1 shouldn't think so. Mr Abberline’s very
ambitious - this is a wonderful opportunity
for him. He’s already an inspector at
thirty-four - who knows, at this rate he'll
have my job before he’s done.

LADY ROSSIE
Then it's just as well he works hard -
that's a high bar for anyone to clear.

Sir Charles gives a little bow, acknowledging the compliment.

LADY ROSSIE
When does he start?

SIR CHARLES
Not for a couple of months but | thought
we should get him acclimatized. The air
up in the West End can be quite rarefied.
eee OE TS ke Same ORR MoS Pees teae

Lady Rossie keeps looking at Abberline. She speaks quietly.

LADY ROSSIE
He's handsome enough, I'll give him that.
Standards and loyalty, that's all we ask
of a man, isn't it Sir Charles?

AT THE FIREPLACE

Abberline is with a group about to play cards. One of the men shuffles the two
packs - nonchalantly he fires the cards from one hand to the other, fans them in
mid-air, cuts them and fans them again. He's in his late 30's - rich and arrogant.
This is the seventh Ear! of Pembroke - Duchy to his friends. He speaks to Abberline -

DUCHY
Would you care to shuffle... I'm sorry, |
can't recall your name.

ABBERLINE
Abberline. Fred Abberline. | don't know any
tricks. | can play, that’s about all.

DUCHY
Surprising. | would have thought a
member of the constabulary would have
known a lot more tricks than us fess
worldly people. i think you're being shy.
Come on - dazzie us.

Before Abberline can answer, a middle-aged man who has spent his life with the
bottle interrupts. Pouring himself another cognac, he speaks to the Ear! -

WILLY
Leave it off, Duchy. What would you
know about “the constabulary” anyway?

DUCHY

(evenly)
You're quite right, of course, Willy - I've
never actually met a policeman before.

He turns back to Abberline. His smile is even more patronizing than his words -

WILLY
Light me up, will you Frederick?

He puts a large Havana in his mouth and points at a glowing taper lying in the
fireplace. The two men look at each other. The other members of the group watch.
Among them is the hostess. She is 29, very beautiful and quite spoilt - ten years
Previously she inherited a fortune. Her name is Lady Jane D'Urbanville and right
now her eyes are totally on the handsome Abberline.

A beat - then Abberline turns and reaches for the taper. So - he gives in. Duchy
smiles and leans forward with the cigar, waiting for the light.

ABBERLINE
Actually, there is one trick | know.

DUCHY
Really? You must show us -

Abberline knocks back his entire glass of cognac - and spits! A stream of liquor
arches towards the cigar. Abberline touches the glowing taper to it - the liquor
bursts into flame. It looks like Abberline is breathing fire, The stream of flame lights
the end of the cigar and dias. The rest of the group stare in amazement - then Lady
Jane claps and cheers. The others join in. Duchy touches his singed forehead -

DUCHY
Those were my eyebrows.

ABBERLINE
Sorry. The trick's a bit like me ! guess - it
needs a little refinement.

WILLY
Damn fine trick it you ask me! Far better
than that crap with the cards.

Lady Jane catches Abberline’s eye - they smile at one another. And Lady Jane
keeps smiling - long enough for Willy to note her interest in Abberline.

A ROW OF CARRIAGES

is drawn up in front of the mansion - the guests are leaving. Lady Jane stands at the
drawing room window. Only a few intimate friends remain, She watches Abberline
get into Sir Charles’ coach. Willy takes Lady Jane's hand -

WILLY
He seems like a fine chap.

LADY JANE
He does, doesn't he?

It's funny though, he said his father was
the doctor at High Wycombe. When }

Damned if | can recall the doctor having
8 son.

LADY JANE
You were probably drunk, that's why.

Another woman has been listening. She turns to Lady Jane -

VIOLET
How could you, Jane? You heard Willy -
he said he was just a child. You didn't
become a drunk until much later, did
you darling?

WILLY
No, Jane's right, I'm afraid. | realized
very early drinking's like sport - you
have to start very young if you really
want to achieve anything.

Lady Jane laughs but her eyes are still on the coach,

MILLER'S RENTS

is a collection of hovels built around a courtyard just off Dorset Street. It's late at
night, the pubs have closed, and the courtyard is crowded with men and women.
The landlord - an unshaven pig of man - stands outside collecting money for an
overnight stay in a tiny room. Mary and Polly, accompanied by another prostitute
from The Ringers, are supporting Dark Annie. They shuffle towards the landlord.
Mary looks in her purse -

MARY
I've only got 6 half-penny left - it looks
fike I'll be traveling steerage.

POLLY

Me too.

They front up to the landlord, each dropping a half-penny into his dirt-stained hand.
He jerks his head, indicating the house behind him.

LANDLORD

A NARROW ROOM

is empty except for several long wooden benches. Crowded onto them are the
urban poor - mothers with kids, hollow-eyed men and down-trodden youths. Sitting
on back-to-back benches so they form a huddle, are the four women -

POLLY
A pound each! '
OARK ANNIE
That's what they said.

Mary and the other prostitute - Liz Stride - look equally shocked. Liz - known as
Long Liz because of her height - grew up in Sweden and speaks with an accent.

LONG LIZ
How do they think we earn so much?

DARK ANNIE
That's not their problem. | used to work
up that end of Whitechapel, that's how
they knew me. There was a girl called
Emma Smith who wouldn't pay. They
didn't cut her breasts, they... they cut
her down there.

The other women look horrified.

DARK ANNIE
That's when | moved down Dorset Street.
I'm not getting cut again, | don’t care how
hare | have to work.

LONG LIZ
Easy to say. How many hours are there

DARK ANNIE
What are you talking about?

POLLY
You know, what some blokes want -
foreign ideas, if you ask me.

Dark Annie just stares at her. She's the most experienced of them all and obviously
nothing's off the menu with her.

DARK ANNIE
Yeah - not like the English, of course - pull
your dress up, back against the wall, that's
their contribution to the art of love.

POLLY
I've got standards, that's all I’m saying...
yes, you can laugh Annie Chapman but -

MARY
(quietly)
1 think | know where we can get the money.

The other thres women turn and look at her, taken aback.

DARK ANNIE
What?

MARY
And not a few pounds either. If we're
going to do this, | was thinking we should
all get out of Whitechapel. | was going to
ask for fifty.

The other women just stare. Then Polly starts to laugh - fifty pounds! Liz Stride's
not sure if it’s a joke or not. Only Dark Annie doesn’t smile -

DARK ANNIE
If we're going to do what, Mary?

Mary is about to answer but she sees three men approaching. She falls silent. The
men, employees of the landlord, string ropes the length of the room and pull them
taut, across the chests of the people sitting on the benches. They've paid to sleep
sitting upright - the rope prevents them pitching forward while they're asleep. The
gas lights are turned down.

Darkness.

CLOUDS OF STEAM

billow out of the rail yards at Liverpool Street station - a huge building, a Gothic
cathedra! to the locomotive. The steam pours across a busy road and hits 8 grim
Stone building. Over the doors is a sign: .

Bishopsgate Police Station

INSIDE THE BASEMENT

Bang! A jet of flame shoots out the end of a barrel as a gun fires. We pull back to
teveal a group of policemen watching Abberline firing at a makeshift target. He's
still got his coat on - he's just arrived et work. The gun is a iong-barreled revolver,
deadly accurate and beautifully made. He hands it to one of the uniformed officers -

ABBERLINE
Where did you get it, Constable?

CONSTABLE
We took it off an American seaman lest
night. He was walking around with it in
his coat - probably thought he was
Wyatt Earp.

ABBERLINE
Lock it in the evidence cabinet when
you're finished. Not that we'll need it -
1 bet he's already jumped bail. He's
probably on a freighter right now
Practicing his French.

He turns to the door. He sees the Sergeant at his locker - he's just finished the night
shift and is getting ready to leave.

Abberline joins him - together they walk out the door and along a corridor.

ABBERLINE
What's on the blotter - anything | should
know?

SERGEANT

empty. But you can't say that about the
Pubs, can you? Drinking's the biggest
industry in Whitechapel. And the women
re as bad as the men.

SERGEANT
Worse. But not yours to worry about
much longer, Fred. No whores up in
Belgravia - at least none that we could
afford.

ABBERLINE
Two months, Pete - it can't happen
soon enough.

They disappear up the stairs.

LARGE SKYLIGHTS

form the ceiling of a spectacular artist's studio: beautiful furniture, an easel in the
middle of the room, canvasses on the walls. It's mid-morning - the front door opens
and @ man enters. He's in his early 30's - well-dressed, sophisticated, cold. This is
Walter Sickert and he's a painter - in time, a famous one. As he takes off his hat
and coat he sees an envelope that’s been pushed under the door.

He picks it up, rips open the flap and starts to read the letter. Though we don’t see
the words, his face becomes increasingly grim -

SICKERT
What the hell, Mary...

At last he lays it down. He walks to the window and stares out, thinking. Then he
comes to @ decision.

SICKERT
Anyway, | wash my hands of it.

He tugs on a bell-pull and a moment later a manservant enters -

As he puts the letter in another envelope and addresses it, we tilt up to one of the
canvasses on the wall. It shows a naked woman lying on a crumpled bed. We
recognize the props - it was obviously painted in the studio - and the woman. It's
Mary Kelly.

CLIVEDEN

is one of England's great country houses - east wing, west wing, twenty bedrooms
and attics for sixty servants. The whole magnificent pile sparkles now in the autumn
sunshine. A horse-drawn carriage travels down the driveway and stops in front of
the house's elegant entrance. Sir Charles Warren gets out and walks up the steps.

THE GARDENS

of the house seem to stretch forever: banks of flowers, stunning topiaries,
immaculate hedges. An elderly man - beautifully dressed, distinguished, powerful -
walks down an avenue of white jonquils. This is Lord Hailsham and Cliveden is his
home. Sir Charles walks at his side.

HAILSHAM
Forty years | was a soldier, Sir Charles.
1 saw men with great skill and learning, on
& few occasions | witnessed outstanding
bravery, but you know the quality | came
to value most - love of country. | know you
have it. Sir Charles, and so do J. in our
different ways we both serve the Kingdom.
We would pay any price rather than see
harm come to it, wouldn't we?

SIR CHARLES
Yes, certainly, Lord Hailsham.

HAILSHAM
So it is with deep regret | must tell you that
Ihave received a letter, a very worrisome
letter. It deals with matters of great
delicacy. Some woman is trying to trade
information for money. Somehow she has
fearned things and now, like a ghost out of
the past, they come back. But like most
ghosts, the only thing to do is lay it to rest.

Hailsham takes Mary's letter out of his jacket pocket and gives it to Sir Charles.
They continue waiking - the jonquils give way to banks of roses as Sir Charles reads
the letter. He looks up -

this is a situation of great delicacy. It's
more a matter of silence.

SIR CHARLES
Silence, m'lord? I'm not sure I follow...

HAILSHAM
You have a good man in Whitechapel,

Sir Charles stares at him, his anxiety starting to rocket.

SIR CHARLES

blundering around where they don't

Hailsham looks Straight at him -a look of real cruelty. We realize - Sir Charles wasn't

will help the widow's son?

Sir Charles stares in silence. A beat. Then he bows his head in acquiescence. Lord
Hailsham puts his hand on Sir Charles's shoulder and leads him back towards the
house.

BROOK STREET

is a row of beautiful houses in the heart of Mayfair. Gas lamps glow in the cold
London night. It's late and the houses are in darkness. All except number seventy-
four. This is the residence of Sir William Gull. We push in on it -

IN THE BATHROOM

Gull is in his 50's, a handsome but arrogant looking man - a tilted jaw, aquiline nose,
a soft mouth. Right now he is almost naked. His flesh is flabby and sickly white, the
teats of an aging man hang down. Despite the hour he has just finished shaving, his
face pink and shining, his hair powdered and perfectly parted. He reaches into a jar,
takes out e handful of lavender and crushes the petals in his fingers, releasing the
perfume. Slowly he rubs it over his soft skin, scenting himself. He starts to dress.

THE RINGERS

The pub is crowded with drinkers. We track past a crowd of men to a table near the
fire. Sitting at it are Mary, Dark Annie, Long Liz and Polly. With them is a friend of
thairs - another prostitute called Catherine Eddowes. Polly is lsughing, modeling 2
new black bonnet.

At the bar is a coachman - a big man in his early 30's - mean and cunning. This is
the sort of man who is cruel to those beneath him and fawning to those he
considers his betters. His name is John Netley. He leans forward and says
something to Walter Ringer - the publican.

after, you couldn't do better than her.

NETLEY
Those others they're all her friends,

Ringer looks at him - he's not sure what he's driving at.

RINGER
Well... yeah... she drinks with ‘em, if
that's what you mean. Most nights they
have a bite of supper.

it in his pocket. A clock somewhere in the house chimes the hour. 11 par m. Gull

Gull picks up 8 smal! leather bag (like an attache case) and heads for the door.

Good evening, Netley. They say before

Pillars of smoke rise into the night, the leaping flames reflected in the river. Boom!
Barrels of pitch, stored in one of the warehouses, explode. in the glare we see
people gathering on the nearby roads and docks to watch.

A SCOTTISH CASTLE

stands brilliant in the moonlight - turrets, crenellated walls and a silver lake. From
inside, we hear an orchestra and gay, brittle laughter.

IN THE BALLROOM

aristocratic men in kilts and dinner suits swing jeweled women around the dance
floor, As the silk and taffeta sail by, we hold on a man's face. He's in his late 20's -
pale skin and refined features - dressed in the best clothes money can buy. We
don't know his name but at one stage in his life he called himself Albert Victor.

The dance comes to an end and Albert bows to his young and silly partner. From
the back of the room, a voice rings out. This is the Laird of the castle -

THE LAIRD
My lords, ladies and gentlemen - the
Joyal toast.

Everyone picks up a glass and raises it to an illuminated portrait of Queen Victoria -

bread and plates of stew to the table.

You sure you won't be having any, Polly?

POLLY

She drains the last of the gin from her glass and gets to her feet.

SPITALFIELDS MARKET

to Netley. He pays and walks to the carriage. The door handle turns as Gull tries to
open it. Netley laughs -

Netley slides the window down and hands the bag of grapes to Gull.

OUTSIDE THE RINGERS

The front door of the pub opens and Polly steps out into the cold night. She ties on
her new bonnet and heads down the dimly-lit street. Above the roofs of the
tenements the sky glows red from the fire at the docks. It looks like hell. Polly heads
towards it. She starts to sing -

her. Closer... closer. Crack! She turns, startled. Netley's coach stands right beside
her. He sits atop it, smiling, the whip he’s just cracked dangling in his hand.

NETLEY

Oh, he has, has he?

She turns and looks in the window - the blind is drawn. '

NETLEY
Go on, girl - open the door.

She turns the handle and swings the door open. All she can see is e pair of
expensive doe-skin shoes - then Gull leans forward out of the darkness and smiles
at her.

GULL
Would you like 8 grape, Polly?

POLLY
Ooh, | do fove ‘em. I never can afford

She steps into the carriage.

GULL

The fire has burned the warehouses to the bones - the brick walls stand like
skeletons amid the flames. People have crowded around the docks, watching the
fire-trucks and bucket brigades.

The coach is parked in a quiet cul-de-sac, hard up against a building. The door
handle jerks as Polly tries desperately to open it. Slam! Her head is rammed up
against the window. Her eyes are glazed, she tries to scream but somehow she
doesn't seem able to manage it. Gull puts his soft mouth close to her ear -

GULL

A flash of steel! Gull drives 3 long double-edged knife down towards her throat -

GULL
The God who punishes blackmailers
and traitors - that’s the God J love, Polly!

At the last moment, Gull looks away - he can't even watch it himself. Polly screams
and jerks. Gull feels the blade hit flesh and bone. He slumps, relieved - the
anticipation is always worse than the reality. He looks back - Polly is staring at him,
wide-eyed, terrified. The blade has missed her throat and sliced into her collarbone.
For a moment they just stare at one another, then Gull lifts up the bloody knife and
plunges it at her throat again. This time she can't avoid it.

ON TOP OF THE COACH

Netley sits in the driver's seat, rocking as the coach sways with the fury of what is
happening inside. Netley's too scared to even look down - he stares straight ahead,
watching the fire turn the sky blood-red.

BRADY STREET

Netley's coach is parked in an unlit street. He and Gull stagger along beneath the
weight of something wrapped in the canvas tarpaulin. They turn into Buck's Row, &
narrow alley. Gull stumbles and falls. He picks himself up and moves on but he's
limping - he's sprained his ankle. They up-end the tarpaulin. Polly's body slides to
the ground. Netley looks at her blood-soaked clothes -

NETLEY
Jesus God...

Polly moans ever so slightly. She's still alive. Netley, revolted, tooks at Gull -

GULL
Don't stare at me! Men have always
reserved the most extreme punishment
for crimes like hers. Now lay her out,
Netley. Pull up her petticoats.

Netley rolls her over onto her back. He looks down at his hands - they're covered in
blood. He turns and walks away -

Gull opens the leather attache case. Fitted inside are a range of instruments - it’s a
portable amputation kit. He takes out a knife with a hooked end. It's called a

crooked bistoury. He kneels between Polly's legs and runs his hand up the flesh of -
her thighs. He’s sweating - he loosens his collar. He grabs hold of her underpants

and slowly pulls them down.

Netley looks st Gull's face. The man’s lips are moist, his eyes glistening. He stabs
the crooked bistoury towerds Polly's stomach. Netley can't watch. All we hear is a
gasp from Polly.

A POLICE CARRIAGE

travels fast down a dark, leafy street. It stops in front of a big house that has been
turned into a middle-class lodging house. The Sergeant from Bishopsgate leaps out
of the carriage and hurries up the steps -

A SUITE OF ROOMS

The embers of a fire glow in the hearth - we glimpse a study, a sitting room, a
bedroom. There's a loud knock on the door. Abberline, alone in bed, sits up. He
picks up his watch - it's almost 3am. Another knock - louder, more insistent.
Abberline swings out of bed and goes for the door. .

POLLY’S BODY

lies spread-eagied in the grime of Buck's Row. Her dress and petticoats are back in
place. Abberline - unshaven, hair still tousied from sleep - and the Sergeant make
their way through curious onlookers. Doctor Lewellyn is waiting for them.

DOCTOR LEWELLYN
There are two major knife wounds. The
first hit her collarbone and deflected. |
doubt it would have killed her. The
second cut her throat from ear to ear.
It's so deep it damn near cut her head off.

Abberline kneels beside the body. Polly's skirt and bodice are covered in blood but
none of the rest of her clothing appears out of place. Abberline takes her clenched
tight hand. Gently, he folds back the fingers - lying in her palm is a grape.

Flash! A brilliant white light bathes the scene. Abberline turns - a photographer has
set up his huge camera and tripod. Abberline turns to the Sergeant -

is the grimmest place we've seen - a cobbled floor, stone walls and marble slabs.
Two elderly men - paupers - use shears to cut away Polly’s blood-stained clothing.
One of the paupers reels back, gagging.

DOCTOR LEWELLYN
What the...?!

He walks forward and looks at where Polly's stomach has been exposed. Her
petticoats are draped so that we don't see what the Doctor does. but from the look
on his face it must be terrible.

DOCTOR LEWELLYN
Jesus Christ.

INSIDE THE POLICE STATION

It's not quite dawn - two overworked constables are taking statements from
residents of Buck's Row. Through an open door we see into -

ABBERLINE’S OFFICE

He sits at his desk - grim, haggard. Polly's blood-stained dress has been pinned to
the wall. The Sergeant enters. He hands Abberline a copy of a newspaper - the
morning's “Illustrated Police News”. On the front page is the photo of Abberline
kneeling over the body.

SERGEANT
Have you seen it? They say the killing’s so
ferocious, it couldn't possibly have been
done by an Englishman.

ABBERLINE
Yes. I've already had a note from the

A SMALL GRAVEYARD

A huge crowd has gathered, pushing forward, trying to get a glimpse of Polly's
cheap wooden coffin. It stands next to an open grave, @ minister leading the small
Group of mourners through the burial service. Mary and the other three prostitutes
stand at one side. Liz tries but she can't stop crying.

Abberline and the Sergeant stand on a small hillock, shocked at the size of the
crowd.

that's put the fear of God up everyone.

Abberline shoulders his way through a circle of men. In the center is 8 man with a
bear on a chain. Other men have pit bulls on leashes. In a moment one of the dogs
will be turned loose on the bear. Abberline, disgusted, keeps walking. He passes -

THE STEPS OF CHRISTCHURCH

A group of street urchins chase each other through the derelicts camped on the
steps. It's an old game with a new twist - a stockily-built boy has 8 piece of rag tied
around his waist and a pointed stick like a knife in his hand. He yells -

Other kids, girls mostly, run screaming, clutching their throats.

A half-naked man - his lower torso covered by a hospital gown - steps out of the
shadows. His face is terribly deformed - a bulbous forehead, flaps of gray wrinkled
skin and a thick stump of bone, like a tusk, protrudes from his upper jaw.

Several socialites, including Lady Jane, stifle a cry, others laugh. Abberline stares at
them, taken aback they should gawk and laugh so freely at someone less fortunate.
He tooks at Lady Jane - she’s all rapt attention, fascinated by Merrick. Then she
turns snd smiles brightly at Abberline -

LADY JANE
Aren't you glad we came?

She takes his arm and leans closer against him.

at Abberline's side. She takes a drink from a waiter and looks around -

LADY JANE
Mr Merrick's a bigger draw than the
Egyptian mummies.

She sees Gull and motions him over - Gull’s ankle is bandaged, he walks with the
help of a cane. He takes Lady Jane's hand and she kisses him on the cheek -

LADY JANE
What ever have you done to yourself?

GULL
{t's nothing - just a sprain.

LADY JANE
Sir William Gull, allow me to introduce
Mister Frederick Abberline. Perhaps
you've read about Mr Abberline - he’s
investigating that murder in Whitechapel.

Gull looks anew at Abberline. The two men shake hands.

GULL
A grisly business, Inspector. The
newspapers have a lot of theories -
what about the police?

ABBERLINE
Information, Sir William, but nothing you
could dignify with the term “theory”. Not
yet, anyway.

GULL
Yet? That indicates confidence, Inspector.
I'm reassured already. How many murders
have you investigated?

ABBERLINE
Thirty... maybe more.
GULL
And how many have you solved?
ABBERLINE
All of them.
GULL

Very impressive.

LADY JANE
Oh, yes, Sir William - Mr Abberline's
quite outstanding. The Police
Commissioner told me so himself.

This is news to Abberline. Sir William sees the flirtatious look she gives Abberline.

GULL
Well, it hardly seems likely then the
murderer can iong evade capture. Not
unless he's extraordinarily clever, of
course. Tell me, inspector -

LADY JANE
if you will excuse me - | should have at
least one word with the freak. | don’t want
it getting around I'm a complete coward.

The men bow as Lady Jane withdraws.

GULL
So tell me - confidentially - he’s not just
some slash and stab merchant is he,
this Whitechapel killer?

ABBERLINE
Why do you say that?

GULL
The Coroner's report in The Times listed
the woman's injuries. It didn't say explicitly,
but it seems to me, professionally
speaking, he disemboweled her.

ABBERLINE
Professionally speaking? Are you a doctor,
Sir William?
GULL
Surgeon.
ABBERLINE

You're right - that's exactly what he did.

GULL
A lot of people wouldn't appreciate how
difficult that is. It tekes a substantial
knowledge of anatomy - and in the dark,
blood everywhere, his heart probably
pounding - the closest thing | could
equate it to is the work of one of those
fine battlefield surgeons. Of course, for
all we know that's how he sees himself

Naturally, it's just speculation - who
could really know what goes through
the mind of such 8 man? I'm probably
making a fool of myself. For all! know,
right now the police are arresting a
butcher.

ABBERLINE
Not at all. We're looking for a wealthy and
intelligent man. He travels by carriage
and that probably means an accomplice.
He can afford grapes - they're out of
season, Sir William, two shillings a pound
down Spitalfields’ market and that's a lot
of money in anyone's language -

GULL
Grapes, Inspector? What have they got
to do with it?

ABBERLINE
I found one in the woman's hand. | spent
hours trying to fathom why she didn't cry
out - surely somebody would have heard
her. Then I realized - he fed her grapes.
But first he brushed them with laudanum.
She was drugged, that's why she didn't
scream.

Gull stares at him, impressed -
GULL
Obviously your reputation is well
deserved, Mr Abberline.

Before Abberline can even shrug it off, Lady Jane returns, flushed with her boldness
at speaking with Merrick.

LADY JANE
You must forgive me, gentlemen. { know

but whoever gave Mr Merrick his stage

She laughs, looking up at Abberline, holding him with her eyes. Gull turns to the
inspector and puts out his hand -

GULL
A fascinating conversation, Inspector. |
hope we can continue it some time. If
l can be of any help, any help at all,
please don't hesitate to call.

Abberline offers Lady Jane his arm - they head towards the doors. Gull doesn't take
his eyes off of Abberline.

THE THAMES EMBANKMENT

It’s a beautiful evening - the lights of the city reflected in the river, Tower Bridge
breathtaking in the moonlight. Abberline and Lady Jane have left the hospital
reception. They walk along the gas-lit path that follows the embankment, expensive
homes fining the street. Lady Jane's carriage follows at a discrete distance.

LADY JANE
Sir William has a reputation for being
arrogant. I've never heard him offer help
to anyone. That's quite a coup - he's so
well connected, too.

ABBERLINE
Is that why you invited me - to make
connections, m'lady?

LADY JANE
You're so very formal - all this "m'lady”
business. It's quaint but it's not really
Necessary, you know.

She turns and gives him her most dazzling smile. instead of taking her in his arms,

Abberline's face grows serious.

ABBERLINE
What of the future, Jane? | mean - who
was your father, the fourteenth Earl of
Leicester? Your family have been
aristocrats since Magna Carta.

LADY JANE
My family wrote the Magna Carta.

She smiles, but she's only half joking.

ABBERLINE
You can hardly say we share a common
background, can you?

LADY JANE
No, but you come from a good family - your
father's a doctor. Anyway, background can
be lost in achievement. You're going to the

She moves closer to him. Unthinkingly, she straightens his tie -

LADY JANE
Don't be so modest. With the right
connections, an outstanding career as a
police officer can open a host of doors.
Politics...business...diplomacy. Can you

She indicates the mansions all around them. Through several windows we see

Abberline hesitates. Again he looks at the beautiful houses - it's so far from where
he began, farther than anyone realizes. He feels light-headed - the beautiful night,
her perfume, the bright shining prizes almost within his grasp. She leans towards
him. He takes her in his arms snd kisses her.

A SALVATION ARMY HALL

Bare boards and rows of trestle tables. It's a soup kitchen - a line of ragged people
snake past cauldrons of food. But right now everything is frozen - one of the
Salvation Army captains is leading everyone in grace.

CAPTAIN
"... for thine is the kingdom, the power
and the glory. Forever and ever. Amen."

The room erupts in a clatter of plates and a rising tide of voices. Mary sits with Dark
Annie, Liz and Kate, a bow! of soup and a Bible in front of each of them.

DARK ANNIE
Jesus, Mary! | know it's not your fault

The others smile but there's no joy in it - they're far too worried. Mary looks at

But I can't to go - not after last time. I'm
Not proud, I'll say it - I'm scared.

Mary nods - she understands. She looks at Kate.

KATE
I'm only working another few days.
John Kelly's asked me to go hop-

not much but it’s a damn sight safer.
No, Mary.

It's up to Long Liz. By nature she is 3 nervous sort of woman -

LONG LIZ
{'d go if the others were... but you
don't know these men. Just the two
of us - it's asking for trouble.

Her voice trails away. Silence. Dark Annie, Kate and Liz look down at their food,
sort of ashamed. We push in on Mary's face. There's a determination to it -

A DARK AND EMPTY STREET

Mary - alone - walks through the shadows. She turns a corner - in the glow of a
street lamp we see a sign on a wall: Old Nichol Street. Mary stops in front of a
building and steps into -

THE BRICKLAYER'S ARMS

It's a quiet pub. People turn and look. Mary makes her way up to the bar. She
speaks so close to the ear of the bartender we can't catch what she says. The
bartender indicates a table in the corner -

McQueen is holding court. Several young women, obviously prostitutes, sit with
Geordie and the Old Nichol Street boys. Mary approaches them - she's frightened
but she’s damned if she's going to show it. McQueen turns and looks at her.

MARY
A couple of you blokes know a friend

THE BACK OF THE PUB

is a pig-sty: piles of trash, empty beer barrels, a tiny out-house for the women. Mary
hands McQueen and Geordie a bag of coins.

MARY
There's eighteen shillings - that's from
the four of us. It would have been more,
but a chap that's going to help us had
10 go away.

McQueen and Geordie look at each other - they're surprised about the money but
they don't let Mary know it.

McQUEEN
Yeah, well - when's he expected back,
this chap of yours?

MARY
A week, maybe. We need time to give
you the rest, that's why I'm here.

McQUEEN
A week you say? At least you made an
effort. All right, then.

Mary turns, about to go, but she can't contain herself. She turns back.

MARY
Why did you do that to Polly? If you'd
have just shown her the knife it would
have scared her half to death.

Yes, Polly. And next time you want to

McQueen's hand flashes out and grabs Mary by the neck. He pulls her close -

“McQUEEN
Listen - we got a business here.
Sometimes we have to encourage the
punters, like with Annie. But kill Polly
Nichols - why the fuck would we bring
that shit down on Whitechapel?

Mary looks into his eyes and knows it's the truth. She trembles, shaken by it -

McQUEEN
What's wrong with you?

MARY
I thought we could deal with you, Mr
McQueen. But me and the other women
have to work those streets. Now
somebody's killed one of us. I'm scared

McQUEEN
' never thought I'd see the day when a

He pushes Mary aside. He and Geordie head back into the pub.

A SPRIG OF GRAPES

lies on the ground in a narrow passage-way just off Dorset Street. From ahead, we
hear voices - Dark Annie has found herself 8 customer. She leads Gull towards a
dark and deserted yard at the back of a row of tenements.

DARK ANNIE
(laughing, sort of high)
Look at me staggerin' will you? You'd
think | was drunk.

GULL
We can stop here if you want.
 

48

DARK ANNIE
No, I'm just tired or something. Everything
seems like it's floating. It feels nice.

GULL
Excellent, Annie - that's excellent.

They keep walking, entering -

THE YARD

Dark Annie props herself against a tall fence. Gull puts down the leather briefcase.
Annie turns to face him. She touches his face -

DARK ANNIE
You're 8 handsome man.
(she laughs)
| just wish your nose‘d stay still, that's all.

GULL
Are you ready, Annie?

DARK ANNIE
Gettin’ all bothered are you?
(she grabs his crotch)
Gawd - it's hard enough, isn't it?

He strikes her hand away. Gull's mask of civility drops - he grabs her by the
shoulder and spins her sround. But Annie, drugged and disoriented, laughs-

DARK ANNIE
Ooh - want it doggie-style, do you?

Gull slips his fingers around her throat. He starts to tighten them - she gasps and
tries to tear free but the drug seems to have sapped her strength. In the first
murder, Gull was nervous but now he starts to find pleasure in his work. He
strangies her with one hand while the other goes to her bodice. He rips open the
buttons, exposing her breasts. His hand slides towards them. Annie fights for air -
her eyes bulge. Gull smiles.

THE YARD NEXT DOOR
Aman comes out the back of the adjoining tenement. This is Albert Cadosch, 2

carpenter, heading out early for work. He unzips his fly, and starts to pee. He sees
nothing - but from next door, he hears a cry.

DARK ANNIE (0.S.)

Cadosch listens - a couple of whimpering sounds - then he decides what it is.

CADOSCH
Fuckin’ whores! Why don’t you do your
business somewhere else.

He turns and walks back inside.

THE YARD

Annie fights for her life. Her fingers tear at Gull's expert stranglehold but she's
growing weaker by the moment. Her eyes roll back in her head and her body shakes
as she goes through the death rattle. Gull lets her crumple to the ground. He turns,
opens the briefcase and selects a long pointed knife -

GULL
Now I'fi give you some artistry, Mr
Abberline.

INSIDE THE MORGUE

tt's 4.30 am, still dark outside. Abberline watches as Doctor Lewellyn pulls back the
sheet from a body, revealing the face. Abberline turns to the Sergeant -

ABBERLINE
ft's Polly Nichols’ friend, isn't it?

SERGEANT
Yeah. Annie Chapman's her name.

ABBERLINE
What sbout the injuries - similar?

DOCTOR LEWELLYN
Worse. He laid open the abdomen,
severed the intestines and put them
over her shoulder. The uterus, the
womb and its attachments were
removed, including -

He turns away. He rubs his eyes - he's weary, drained.

ABBERLINE
Jesus. Where do you even start with
a man like this?

He looks at them. Silence. Nobody can answer.

OUTSIDE THE MORGUE

reporters and sightseers all over the place - Whitechapel's rumor mill has been
spreading the news for the last hour. The reporters surge forward as Abberline
comes out the front doors. They yell questions but Abberline, grim-faced, shoulders
his way through. An ugly murmur rises up from the crowd - women shout abuse at
Abberline. They want the police to do something - two murders in a couple of days!
Abberline stares at them - he knows they’re frightened but still he's shocked. He
gets into a waiting cab. The driver cracks his whip. The horses push through...

INSIDE THE RINGERS

Mary Kelly has been crying. It's about 9am - there's only a few hard-core drinkers in
the pub. She sits alone, pale and frightened. Walter Ringer puts a glass in front of
her and fills it with gin. He puts out his hand for payment -

MARY
I'm skint, Mr Ringer. Can you put it
on the slate?

He goes to take the drink sway - then he looks at her face.

RINGER
Just this once, 'cos of Dark Annie, that's
all. You pay me tomorrow, you hear?

She nods her head. Unseen by Mary, Abberline comes through the front door and
looks around. He sees Mary in the corner and makes his way towards her. Mary
picks up the glass but her hand's trembling. Before she can get it to her mouth,
liquor splashes onto the table.

MARY
{to herself)
Damn - get a grip!

ABBERLINE (0.S.)
1 knew a man with a problem like that.
51

Mary turns. She tries to smile - she really is pleased to see him. He pulls up a chair.

ABBERLINE
He drank himself into an early grave,
but you. know what he used to do? _

She shakes her head - no. Abberline leans close and drapes his handkerchief around
the back of her neck. One end he puts in her left hand, the other he wraps around
the glass of liquor. He clamps her right hand around it -

ABBERLINE
Now pull down your left hand.

The handkerchief around her neck acts like a pulley. The farther she pulls down with
her left hand, the higher her right hand and the glass rise up. It gets it to her mouth
without spilling 8 drop. Despite her troubles, she can’t help smiling.

ABBERLINE
See, works like a charm. Of course, the
man | learned it from was an alcoholic -
that's why he couldn't hold a glass.
What about you?

MARY
You heard about Annie Chapman?

Abberline nods. Mary starts to say something but she can't - tears fill her eyes.

ABBERLINE
There's a writer called Oscar Wilde - he's
got 2 play on now. One of the characters
says “to lose one parent may be a
misfortune; to lose both looks like
carelessness”. You could say the same
about friends. What's going on, Mary?

She looks at him, not sure how far she can trust him. Their eyes meet - Abberline’s
don't waver. She's tempted to unburden herself but then she thinks better of it -

MARY
Nothing. Working girls stick together.
They have to - we're sort of outcasts,
aren't we? | guess a lot of girls knew
both of ‘em.

nice of you to offer, but anyway - what
could you do?

He reaches into his coat and gives her three one pound notes.

ABBERLINE

Stay off the streets. That's a start.

She stares at him for a moment, unbelieving -

MARY

ABBERLINE
"Course you can. Now go on.

MARY
But... why are you doing this?

ABBERLINE
I told you | could help, didn't I?

Mary looks at him. The money could be a life-saver - literally. She puts her arms
around his neck and kisses him. Men turn and look. Abberline gently disentangles
her arms. She takes hold of his hand -

MARY
| didn't always do this work, Fred. Ever
since | was thirteen I've had real jobs.
For five years | was a lace-maker - but
then that went bad and what can you

He squeezes her hand, turns and leaves.

CLEVELAND STREET

he's a day, wipes away the dust. He is the keeper of the records - all around him are
shelves piled with police files. He pushes the stack across to Abberline -

OLD MAN
You can look for yourself. That's the file
on every case investigated in that area
for the last five years. I'm tellin’ you,
though - there's nothing about 24
Cleveland Street.

ABBERLINE
What about the girl - Annie Crook?

There's nothing on her either.

ABBERLINE
Say she'd died, would her file have been
put somewhere else?

OLD MAN

No. If you're born in these files, you
die in these files. She's no deader than
you orl -

{he laughs)
Well, no deader than you, anyway. But
like | say Inspector, you're welcome to
look for yourself.

Abberline shakes his head - no. He starts to leave. Then he remembers something.
He turns back -

ABBERLINE
One of the residents said he heard the
name of a copper. He doesn't know his
rank or anything but he said he thought
he was a senior man. Mr Kidney they
called him.

A shadow passes across the old man’s face -

OLD MAN
There's only one bloke | know of that
name, not that you'll find him listed
anywhere. Superintendent Ben Kidney.
He works for the Special Branch.

ABBERLINE
{taken aback)
Jesus. Is that why there'd be no file?

OLD MAN
Oh, there'd be a file alright, but they keep
all that stuff to “emselves. You won't find
out nought from them. Dirty bastards, if
you ask me.

ABBERLINE
Yeah, that's their reputation all right.

More worried than ever, he turns and goes.

SIR CHARLES WARREN

stands in the corner of his beautiful, wood-paneled office. It's a cozy place on this
cold night - a fire in the hearth, gas lights on the wails. Sir Charlies pours Scotch
from a crystal decanter and carries two glasses to a pair of arm-chairs. Abberline
sits in one of them - ~

SIR CHARLES
No, I'm not going to authorize it - mainly
because | can't. The Special Branch
teport directly to the Home Secretary.

ABBERLINE
But you know the Prime Minister, Sir

ABBERLINE
For a murder investigation.

Again the two men look at one another. Sir Charles rolls the scotch around in his
glass. He softens -

SIR CHARLES

THE STEEPLE OF CHRISTCHURCH

rises up into the night. On either side of the road prostitutes walk their beat. Mary
stands under a street lamp, waiting for business. Abberline comes towards her.
Despite the anger she feels towards him, she doesn't want him to see her like this.
She turns away, but too late - he's seen her.

She starts to turn away but he reaches out, grabs her shoulder and spins her back.

ABBERLINE
Listen to me! That wasn't the police
down in Cleveland Street - that was the
Specia! Branch. Do you know who they
are? They were set up to deal with your

Now leave me alone!

She pulls her arm free of his grip, turns and walks away. Abberline watches her
head down Dorset Street. He sets off himself - then stops and looks back. Mary has
been stopped by 8 man - she's smiling at him, tucking the hair back from her
beautiful eyes. Abberline can’t help it - he’s angry and jealous. He turns snd keeps
walking, not wanting to see how the man's proposition is resolved.

A SQUAT STONE BUILDING

The ground rumbles with a fast approaching roar. It's night - through a tall iron
railing a train flashes by. Abberline crosses a courtyard and enters the heavily barred
front door of the building. These are the offices of the Special Branch.

INSIDE THE BUILDING

A police constable sits behind a security grill. Abberline stands on the other side. He
opens his wallet and shows a gold crest - the badge of his rank.

ABBERLINE
. (mumbling)
Inspector Adderly, here to see Mister
Kidney.

The constable barely looks at the name (Adderly and Abberline are close anyway) -
he recognizes the crest as genuine. He indicates a clock on the wall -

CONSTABLE
It’s dinner time. Superintendent
Kidney's not back yet, sir.

ABBERLINE
{smiling)
And the bastard said he had a big job
on - 3 big job with a knife and fork

Third floor, isn’t it?

CONSTABLE

Second.

Abberline makes a show of remembering and heads towards the stairs.

THE COURTYARD

Three men head towards the stone building. Ben Kidney, the senior man, is in his
40's. Drassed in a fine gabardine coat, there's an air of sophistication to him. But
it's his eyes that give him away - they are hard and cruel. With him are Tom Press,
in his 20's, and a brutal-looking man called Garret Brack - also members of the
Special Branch. The light from a candle flickers in a third-floor window.

TOM
Somebody's working fate...

Kidney follows the direction of his gaze.

KIDNEY
Whoever it is, I'm gonna take their
balls off. How many times have } told
‘em - you can’t use an open light in the
file room? One day they'll burn the
whole shitbox down.

IN THE FILE ROOM

Abberline is working fast, searching through the racks of files that line the walls.
Screech! Abberline jumps - then he realizes it's the whistle of a train on the tracks
right next to the building. The smoke from its engine, visible through two fong
windows st the back of the room, throws strange shadows across the wails.

THE FRONT DESK
The constable uniocks the security grill, admitting Kidney and the two other men.
CONSTABLE

The constable stares at Kidney, confused. A beat.

KIDNEY
Jesus Christ - the file room!

The three of them race for the stairs.

THE FILE ROOM

Abborline's got a cabinet open at the letter “c", tearing through the files, searching
tor “Cleveland Street”. Nothing. He keeps looking. From outside the room - Bam!

KIDNEY (0.S.)
Shit!

Abberline reacts - his early warning system has been triggered.

THE CORRIDOR

Kidney is in a heap on the floor, tripped by a thin wire stretched across the darkened
corridor. He scrambles up, mouth twisted in anger.

THE FILE ROOM

Abberline searches furiously. He stops at a file. On the top - “Crook, Annie Mary”.

He rips the file out of the cabinet. It contains a single sheet of paper - an official

document, like an admission form. Printed across the top are the words:

Marylebone Workhouse

THE CORRIDOR

There are two doors into the file room. Kidney motions to Press and Brack - they
approach one door, Kidney takes the other. Simultaneously, they burst in -

THE FILE ROOM

is empty. The lantern flickers on a table. Drawers are open, the room in disarray.
Kidney's eyes search the shadows - the intruder could be anywhere. He draws a
gun. Slowly he moves forward - screech! Kidney jumps - then realizes, it's just the
train whistle.

He looks at one of the tall windows - smoke from the train's locomotive spills
through 8 tiny crack at the top. Someone hasn't closed it properly! Kidney motions
to Press and Brack. They close in on one window, Kidney on the other.

OUTSIDE THE BUILDING

Abberline dangles between the two windows, his hands gripping the iron gutter,
nothing supporting his feet. The railway tracks are fifty feet below. He watches the
shadows inside the room. They move closer - smash! Fists come through the glass
on either side of him. He only has a second to think - Kidney’s head is out the
window, the gun rising, his finger on the trigger. Abberline looks down - train
carriages hurtle along the tracks. Kidney's finger tightens. Abberline drops! Kidney
fires - misses. Abberline plunges down -

THE ROOF OF THE TRAIN

He hits the roof of the carriage and tumbles - towards the edge. His hand grabs an
iron conduit on the roof. He lies there, spread-eagled on top of the speeding train.

IN THE FILE ROOM
Kidney leans out the window. watching the figure of the man grow smaller.

KIDNEY
Who the fuck was that?

The train disappears into a tunnel.

A HUGE ARCHED ROOM

The ceiling is supported by three massive beams. A slogan is painted on each of
them: God !s Good; God Is Holy; God Is Just. We tilt down to several hundred
women - some infirm, some retarded, all dressed in gray smocks. They sit at work
benches doing simple sewing - sheets, pillow cases, sacks, This is Marylebone Work
House - a pauper’s prison. A female Governor steps onto an observation platform.
Abberline stands behind her.

GOVERNOR

Annie Crook... Annie Mary Crook!

A woman stumbles to her feet. She's in her late 20's and must have been quite
beautiful once. Now her hair is lank, shoulders stooped, her eyes dull and vacant.

INSIDE AN OFFICE

Annie sits on 8 chair, twisting the sleeve of her smock. The Governor and a resident
doctor watch as Abberline pulls up a chair and sits in front of her -

ABBERLINE
Annie, | want to ask you some questions -

Annie doesn't look at him. She keeps staring straight ahead. Her voice is dull, flat -

ANNIE

ABBERLINE

Who's Alice - is that your baby?

ANNIE

ABBERLINE
Annie, listen -

ANNIE
And there was a Queen, 8 wicked old
Queen and the Queen said “Off... off

She looks up at Abberline - there are tears in her eyes. Abberline speaks gently -

ABBERLINE
It's just a story, Annie.

ANNIE
No! | want my Alice. | climbed out...

Abberline looks to the Governor for help. She shakes her head -

GOVERNOR

I'm afraid the Governor's right - you'll

Annie is still rambling on about the children's story. Abberline shakes his head -
what can you do? The Governor takes Annie by the arm and leads her out.

ABBERLINE
What was the cause of it?

DOCTOR
There's a number of serious medical
conditions for which it is necessary to
remove the thyroid gland. This was
before she came here, of course.
Unfortunately one of the side effects
is almost a total loss of memory.

ABBERLINE
Do you know anything about her? Is
there a case file or anything like thet?

DOCTOR
Not that | know of, Inspector, but she
came from Guy's Hospital. They'd
saved her life or something. | remember
because they told me the name of the
surgeon involved - he's one of the finest
in the land. Sir William Gull.

Abberline just looks at him. A beat..

ABBERLINE
These ere the Coroners’ reports on the

able to help in regard to the weapon.

GULL
The weapon, Inspector?

ABBERLINE
Yes. !f you look at the report on the first
murder, it says the wounds were so
deep, they were probably done with an
ax. I don't think that’s possible - there's
Not enough room to wield an ax ina

GULL
Of course not. The Coroner's reports -
fascinating...

He picks up the file and starts to read. Abberline studies the man - the arrogant
face, the soft flesh, the expensive clothes. He glances at Gull's doe-skin boot
resting on the stool. It's obviously hand-made - pressed into the heel is the
bootmaker's personal mark, a three-turreted castle. Gull lays the file down -

GULL
{t certainly wasn't an ax. It seems from
the wounds it was a long double edged
blade. One has to wonder how these
Coroners get the job.

ABBERLINE
1 often think that myself. So, in a confined
space without much force behind it, the
weapon would have to be incredibly
sharp, wouldn't it? You were saying
before, this is probably 8 man with a
substantial knowledge of anatomy - 1
think you mentioned a battlefield surgeon.
What sort of weapon do you think a man
like that would use, Sir Witliam?

GULL
Well, there's a number of possibilities...
of course, being double edged narrows
it down. The word “battlefield” brings at
least one instrument to mind.

He smiles as he reaches into his drawer and pulls out the long double-bladed knife
he used to kill Polly. He hands it to Abberline -

GULL
It's called a Liston knife, named after
8 brilliant surgeon in the Crimean War.
Because there was no anesthetic he
had to carry out amputations as
quickly as possible. He designed the
knife so that he could have a leg “on
the sawdust" in under a minute.
Naturally | can't say it's the weapon, but
it does fit our criteria - about ten inches
long, double-edged, serrated, two
narrow ridges to fold back the flesh and
drain away the blood. It's a beautiful
instrument, surgically speaking, of
course.

Abberline turns the instrument over in his hands -

ABBERLINE
Every surgeon would have one?

GULL
Yes. They're standard issue in 8 portable
amputation kit. But even if I’m right, I'm
afraid it doesn't do us much good,
inspector - you can get them at any
medical supply shop. Apart from that.
the army must have thousands of them.

Gull takes the knife back and returns it to the drawer.

ABBERLINE
But it's a start - a Liston knife. Thank
you, Sir William, as always you've been
8 great help.

Abberline gets up, shakes Gull's hand - then stops. He makes out he has just
remembered -

his hand goes to straighten his tie, then he changes his mind. A beat.

GULL

ABBERLINE

ABBERLINE

GULL

ABBERLINE

Gull smiles, acting as if the mystery is solved -

GULL

such people patients - | just do the
surgery on the list. Naturally, | don't

The street at the front of Bishopsgate Police station is coming to life. A cab draws

lined with sightseers. Uniformed police keep them back as ranks of ceremonial
troops pass by - the Household Cavalry, the Life Guard, the Imperial Dragoons...

A cheer goes up for the Queen's gold-encrusted State coach. The dour old woman,
dressed in her perpetual black, sits alone, waving at her subjects. Following close
behind are dozens of other coaches carrying members of the Royal Family and the
country's lesding noblemen.

In the second rank is a magnificent vehicle trimmed in gold. Driving it - ramrod

see the driver's face because the footmen and postillions block him from view.)

ABBERLINE
The second coach! Look at the man

Mary nods her head - yes. She steps out onto the road. The coach draws abreast of
them. Inside a man sits alone. It’s Albert Victor. He turns -

Mary looks through the window. The man starts to wave at what he thinks is an
enthusiastic subject. Then he stops - he and the woman have seen each other

MARY
Why?

ABBERLINE
i don't believe you, Mary - I think you're

anywhere you're known, You can't work,
can you? Stick to the poor neighborhoods
- you've got a better chance of being lost
there. Stay in that lodging house, but only
as long as nobody knows you. That takes
money. Can you afford it?

Mary looks at him - tenderness in her eyes.

MARY
I'll ask Mrs Finnane if | can work for
fodging. If she'll do it, it'll be char work in
the kitchen - four in the morning ‘til after

Time to go. They look at one another. A beat - then Mary puts out her hand.

Abberline shakes it.

MARY
Goodbye, Fred.

She goes. Abberline watches her head towards the Houses of Parliament. He turns

away, into the crowd.

AN IRON RAILING

Mary hurries past it. She glances in at the State carriages parked on the other side -
and stops dead in her tracks. She stares through the bars and though we don't see
what she does, we can tell from her face - it chills her to the bone.

He turns - Mary comes towards him.

MARY
The Prince's coachman, I've seen him

he asked Polly her name.

Abberline stares at her - at last he gets 2 break.

ABBERLINE
Where, Mary?! Point him out!

Mary leads him into the crowd.

THE IRON RAILING

Mary and Abberline push through to the front of the crowd. She points at the

stares at him, marking him well.

ABBERLINE

He turns and looks at her - she's got other things on her mind.

She gathers up her skirts, pushes through the crowd and hurries away -

MARY
There and everywhere else. Listen -

Ringer nods. Mary hurriedly writes out a note. Above the bar, she sees a sign for
“Gilbey’s Gin”. She signs the note “Mary Gilbey” and puts it in an envelope.

MARY
Make sure you tell her it's from me,

He nods his head. She turns and leaves.

BEAUTIFUL ROLLING HILLS

Fields of gold and yellow, haycarts in the dales, men and women harvesting

vegetables. Under a tree, Kate Eddowes takes a drink from a bucket. She turns as 8
sunburnt man in his 30's approaches. This is John Kelly, her common-law husband.

JOHN
There's a bloke just arrived from
London. He says they're offering a

Kate starts to think about it -

JOHN
Shit, Kate - two hundred quid, just for

HYDE PARK

Gull and Lord Hailsham walk down an avenue of beautiful oak trees. The sun is
setting, casting a tangled web of shadows across their faces. Though we don't hear
what they are saying, it’s obvious Hailsham is angry. They come to a rise and look a
cross a lawn. An afternoon rally has attracted thousands of people. A sign behind
the podium reads:

Whitechapel Vigilance Committee
The president of the newly-formed group addresses the crowd -

PRESIDENT
Four women dead in a matter of weeks -

A roar of agreement goes up from the crowd. Lord Hailsham turns to Gull -

on the side of the road.

Abberline sits next to the driver - watching the kids and the side gate of
Buckingham Palace. The pigeon pecks its way under the box. One of the urchins
tugs @ string - the box falls down! Abberline looks up - a black carriage, the death
coach, comes fast out of the gate. In the light of a street lamp, Abberline sees the
driver's face - it's Netley.
ABBERLINE
Go!

The driver cracks his whip. Abberline looks down the street - it's bustling with
carriages. Netley's coach travels fast - already it's half a block ahead.

NETLEY

is 8 fine driver, weaving in and out of the chaos of the street. He looks across, into
the sweeping driveway of Buckingham Palace. Uniformed guards start to open the
black and gold wrought-iron gates.

NETLEY
Shit!

He whips the horses hard, driving them into a gallop. Other uniformed guards step
into the street, stopping all traffic. Netley’s carriage squeezes through.

ABBERLINE

Abberline stands up and looks - the traffic all around the Palace has been stopped.
The Queen, in a beautiful crimson carriage. is returning from dinner. The Household
cavalry accompany her towards the gates of the Palace. The Royal carriage swings
past Abberline. For a moment, he and the bitter old woman look at one another.
Then she's gone and Abberline looks down Pall Mall - Netley's carriage is gathering
speed, disappearing. Abberline's lost him.

THE BURNED OUT RUINS

of Ratcliffe Docks are silhouetted against the night. A row of filthy slums line the

INSIDE THE PEOPLE'S PALACE

Liz Stride lies on the floor of a room little bigger than a closet. Empty gin botties lie
next to her. She opens her eyes - God, it's one hell of a bender she’s been on. Bang!
Bang! on the door - the sound cuts through her head like a knife.

LANDLORD (0.S.)
Open the bloody door!

Liz crawls to the door on her knees and unslips the bolt. The door swings open -

LANDLORD

Abberline pays his driver and bounds up the steps. He's lost Netley - whatever he

THE DEATH COACH

is parked out of sight in a dark alleyway. We crane up from it - above the adjoining
tenements. We look down Dorset Street - on the corner is The Ringers pub.

INSIDE THE PUB
Ringer serves a glass of ale to Netley.

NETLEY

RINGER
Sorry... no idea, mate.

NETLEY
I'd make it worth her while. Yours, too.

Ringer looks down - Netley slides a silver florin across the bar.

RINGER
Now you put it like that - she did leave a
note for one of her pals.

He rummages under the bar, pulls out the envelope and reads the note.

RINGER
it says a friend from Sweden's turned up

Ringer tosses the note and envelope in a corner of the counter and turns away.
Netley reaches over, flicks open the note and looks at the address.

Still, it's early - the Kelly woman can
await our pleasure. Jesus himself said
he'd make us fishers of men. Drive,
Netley - we'll cast our net once
more in the sewer of Whitechapel.

Netley turns and swings himself onto the driver's seat. He snaps the reins - the
carriage disappears into the night.

WILKES STREET

A flower seller has a stall on the corner. Liz Stride - looking for trade - picks 8
broken red carnation out of the gutter. She snaps off the stem and fits the bloom
into her buttonhole. Smiling, she continues on her way.

THE DEATH COACH

turns into Wilkes Street. Traveling fast, it passes pawnshops, pubs and a group of
drunk, arguing men. It bears down on the flower seller. Naither Gull or Netley have
seen Liz, but at any moment they will. Closer they come, closer - still they haven't
seen her! Liz, blithely unaware, turns into a tiny alley-way. The death coach gallops
past.

OORSET STREET

Liz has cut through the alley into the heart of the red-light area. She stands outside
the Salvation Army hail, talking to a friend of hers - Kate Eddowes. The sounds of
voices singing a hymn - “Amazing Grace" - carries over from inside the hall. Kate is :

KATE

Liz knows how it is alright - people looking after themselves. They keep talking but
we pull back from them -

THE DEATH COACH

has turned into Dorset Street. The sidewalks are crowded and Liz and Kate stand in
the shadows. Then the hymn, accompanied by an organ, reaches it's finale. The
sound of the voices, uplifted to God, carries across the road. Netley turns - and
reins the horses back hard.

Bang! Gull slides open a narrow panel that allows the passenger to talk to the driver.

Netley inclines his head and holds up his fingers - two. Gull looks at the two
women. Already the excitement is starting to rise within him. He smiles.

ON THE SIDEWALK

Liz checks her make-up in a fragment of mirror and returns it to Kate.

The two women nod to each other in farewell. Liz turns and walks down the street,
looking for trade. Netley loosens the reins - the carriage moves towards her.

Aman stops Liz and looks her up and down. We don't hear what he says but he's
obviously asking her the price. Inside the cerriage, Gull's excitement turns to anger.
Under his breath. he curses the man - a vile string of obscenities. The man shakes
his head - whatever price Liz is asking is too much for him. Liz keeps walking. As
the carriage draws abreast of her, Gull slides down the passenger window.

GULL
Young lady. Young lady...

Long Liz turns and approaches the coach.

GULL
. My dear, you look chilled to the bone.
Open the door, come into the warm.

He smiles at her. Liz looks at his distinguished face - it reassures her. She puts on a
comely smile -

LONG LIZ
It's a pleasure to meet a kind gentleman
on such a raw evening.

She climbs in out of the wind but just to be safe leaves the door open.

LONG LIZ

He slides his hand inside her bodice and starts to feel her breasts.

suddenly frightened. She grabs the door handle and turns - it won't open! The crack
of the whip - the coach starts moving. She spins back to Gull -

GULL
We're going to have to be quick!

The Liston knife drives towards her breasts - it hits her flesh. Liz screams. Gull's
hand clamps across her mouth. He slashes the knife down from her breasts to her
knees, cutting apart her dress and petticoats, laying bare her stomach and crotch.
Liz, still alive, stares at him in horror. He draws the knife back, aiming at her
stomach -

The coach turns into a dark, cobblestoned road. Liz's stifled cry is drowned out by
the clatter of wheels.

LIZ STRIDE’S BODY

lies in a heap in Outfield Yard. Constables with lanterns search the surrounding
alleyways. Already the curious are starting to gather - in another few hours it will
grow to a flood. Abberline pushes through. He bends down next to the half naked
body and looks at Liz's mutilated face - her eyelids have been slashed, the tip of her
nose is missing. A detective comes to Abberline’s side -

DETECTIVE
She hasn't got any papers on her. We're
rounding up some of the bang-tails to
806 if anyone can identify her.

ABBERLINE
Don’t bother - her name's Elizabeth
Stride. Long Liz.

He turns and leans back against the wall - tired, defeated.

SERGEANT

one! About a mile away.

Abberline stares at the Sergeant. Fear and panic sweep over him -

ABBERLINE
Jesus... who?! Mary Kelly?

SERGEANT
No. Woman by the name of Eddowes.

Abberline stares at him - Kate Eddowes? He takes a moment to calm himself. The
thought that it might have been Mary has really panicked him. God, he didn’t realize
( how much he'd come to care about her.

SERGEANT
Are you all right, Fred?

ABBERLINE
Yeah... just give me 8 moment.

SERGEANT
Quick! The woman screamed - we

GRAFFITI ON A WALL

is written in large letters in chalk:

"The Juwes are not the men who
will be blamed for this for nothing”

Lying underneath it is a piece of blood-soaked apron and, not far away, the slashed
and gutted body of Kate Eddowes. Police are milling about everywhere. Abberline
(om and the Commissioner himself, Sir Charles Warren. look at the graffiti -

ABBERLINE
Of course, it could have been on the
wall before the murder - they're mostly
Jewish people living in this building.

SIR CHARLES
Wash it off.

Abberline looks at him, unbelieving -

ABBERLINE
Sir Charles - it may be evidence. It
should be photographed.

SIR CHARLES
That's not a mis-spelling of "Jews". It's
got nothing to do with synagogues. It's
8 word only a Mason would use. Like
everything to do with the Freemasons,
its meaning is secret.

ABBERLINE
That's even more reason we should
keep it.
SIR CHARLES

No! It's probably someone trying to discredit
the Masons. A lot of powerful men are
members of the society. ! don't need them
asking why that was allowed to happen.
Come to that, we don't need every rabbi in
London asking the same thing.

The two men look at each other - Abberline obviously doesn't agree.

SIR CHARLES
h's my responsibility, Fred.

Grim-faced, Abberline nods his head in agreement. He turns and walks away. Sir
Charles watches him go. There's a sadness in the Commissioner's eyes - he knows
just how compromised he is.

KATE'S BODY
is lifted onto a stretcher and carried to the back of an ambulance. A constable has

almost finished scrubbing the graffiti from the wall. Abberline moves slowly, almost
alone, near where her body lay. On the ground are a couple of buttons.

He bends to look at them - probably torn from Kate as the killer ripped her bodice
off. He starts to stand - then he sees one of the cobblestones is missing. A thin film
of blood has flowed into it, covering the mud. Pressed into it is the perfect imprint
of a man’s heel.

Abberline pulls out a white handkerchief and presses it into the hole. Carefully he
lifts it out. Traced in blood is an impression of the heel print. In its center is the
bootmaker's mark - a three-turreted castle.

ABBERLINE

We hold on him - totally alone, staring at the truth. The wind starts to rise, moaning
and sighing through the tenements. It carries over to -

Mary is asleep. The few possessions she has are scattered around the room - @
couple of dresses hanging from hooks on the wall, a photograph of a family
standing in front of a broken-down Irish cottage. a small glass perfume jar...

The point of the Liston knife slides between the edge of the door and the frame. It
flicks up the latch. Without @ sound, the door opens. Gull slides in and closes it
behind him. Click! He locks it. He puts the bag down on the floor and crosses to the
bed. In the darkness it's a jumble of blankets and pillows. He takes hold of the bed
clothes and draws them back. The bed is empty.

A rustle of movement behind him! He spins, raising an arm to fend off the blow.
There's nothing there - just the wind through a crack in the window, hitting the
dress hanging on the wall. Gull looks around - the room is empty.

A NARROW LANEWAY

The death coach is parked in the shadows. Netley is in his seat. There's blood on
his overcoat, a smear of it across his face - he looks shattered. He glances up at the
second floor of the boarding house. Through the window of room 14 he sees a
candle moving back and forth. What's Gull doing? {s it over - that fast?

INSIDE MARY'S ROOM

Gull lifts up Mary's underwear and holds it to his face, catching the smell of her
body. He casts it aside and picks up the photograph - a dirt poor Irish family.
There's five children - all boys except for a beautiful girl aged about twelve. It's
unmistakably Mary. Gull puts it down and takes up the perfume bottle. It’s called
“Wild Roses”. He takes out the stopper - and curls his nose in disgust.

Crash! Something metallic hits the ground deep within the house. Gull turns,
listening -

IN THE KITCHEN

Mary is at work. She curses as she picks up a large cauldron of water she's
dropped. It’s four in the morning and she's alone, getting the kitchen ready for the
day. It’s a sequence of inter-connected rooms - food pantry, scullery, china room,
bread ovens. A fire roars in the hearth. Mary picks up the cauldron and puts it on
the grate to boil.

THE DOOR

into the scullery opens and Gull - his frock-coat buttoned, carrying his leather bag -
enters. He listens. Nothing. He walks between the wooden benches, passes the
pantry and enters the heart of the kitchen.

It's hard to see - pots and bans heng from racks, a series of benches and half-walls,

hand. He walks forward.

NEXT TO THE BREAD OVENS

Three cats circle 8 rat they've trapped. One of the cats pounces, grabs the rat by
the neck 8nd shakes it. A second cat turns - Gull is standing looking at them. This

was the noise he heard. The adrenaline runs out of him. He relaxes. A voice behind
him -

MARY (0.S.)
What are you doing?

Gull, startled, spins - Mary's come in from the courtyard. She holds two buckets
she’s filled from the water pump. She looks at Gull's distinguished face, takes in his
frock-coat and the leather bag - and smiles.

MARY
I'm sorry, Doctor - | didn't mean to
startle you.

Gull’s seen her before, or a version of her - in the photograph. He drinks her in with
his eyes - the lustrous hair, the fine features, the soft swell of her breasts. The
others were nothing compared to this. .

GULL
What a lovely scent you're wearing.
It smells like wild roses.

MARY
That's exactly what it is. Can | help
you?

GULL

Yes, I've been looking for someone.
Would you care for a grape?

Out of his pocket he takes a bag of grapes. He walks up to her, offering the grapes.
Mary reaches out and takes one. Gull is now within striking distance. Mary lifts the
grape to her mouth.

Gull's hand, hidden from her, is coming up - he’s going to grab her throat and close
off the cerotid artery. Not to kill her, but enough to make her helpless. He wants to
enjoy this. His lips are dry, he runs his tongue slong them. Mary doesn't notice -
she's looking past him.

streams through a window and into the kitchen. The place is bustling - cooks and
maids are getting breakfast ready for the lodgers.

THE DESERTED DINING ROOM

Mary sits down at one of the long tables. Abberline takes the page from “The Star”
out of his pocket - the one that shows the women at Polly’s funeral. He lays it
down in front of her.

ABBERLINE

Mary's face is turned away but she shudders - she's starting to sob.

Silence. A beat. Then she looks up.

She stops to collect herself, trying not to cry. She goes on -

Albert Victor's relationship with Annie.
He was in love with her - every chance
he got, he was at the house. You only

He was the father of her child.

MARY
That's the point, Fred - she wasn’t
illegitimate. Over a year ago, before
she was pregnant, Annie Crook and
Albert Victor went to a tiny church in
Sussex. The only witnesses were
two farm workers. On an afternoon
late in July they were married.

ABBERLINE

This is the Kingdom you're talking
about, Mary. A thousand years of
power! No wonder they're killing
people. She would have been Queen.
As monarch, Albert Victor becomes
head of the Church of England - the
marriage couldn't be dissolved.

(he pauses)
You said you were desperate.

MARY

but | didn't know that then. All | knew
was that somebody was willing to go
to 8 lot of trouble to keep it quiet. | got

Throne?!

William Gull. The same man that took

Mary stares at him - really scared.

ABBERLINE

MARY
There was a doctor here this morning.

ABBERLINE
How do you know?

MARY

She looks at Abberline. His face is ashen.

MARY
It was him, wasn't it?

Abberline nods his head - yes. Mary starts to shake. Abberline reaches out and
finally puts his arms around her. She folds herself against him. He holds her tight -

his position and power.

MARY

ABBERLINE
There's a woman I know... she's an
eristocrat, nobody's better connected.

MARY
How do you know you can trust her?

ABBERLINE
Because she's... she...

He tries to find the right words. Mary looks at his face - she guesses the nature of
the relationship. Their eyes meet and they look at one another.

ABBERLINE
No, Mary - it's not like that. It all seems
like a lifetime ago.

She looks even deeper into his eyes. He leans forward and kisses her. She kisses
him back - not matter what else happens, she’s thankful she's found this. She puts
her head egainst his chest, feeling the warmth of him. From outside - the sound of
voices. Breakfast is starting to be served.

ABBERLINE
We have to get you of here. Do you

MARY
What about where you live? I'd feel
safer there.

MARY
There's a place down the other end of
Whitechapel. | just saw it once, nobody

Abberline nods, getting to his feet, helping her up.

OUTSIDE THE BOARDING HOUSE

It's starting to rain - people hurry along the sidewalks, heading out early for work.
Abberline and Mary - carrying a bag holding her few possessions - come out the
front door of Mrs Finnane's. They move fast - Abberline is looking around, wary -
and head up the street.

We hold on a block of stables opposite. A young kid - no more than twelve -
watches them. He tosses his grooming brush to another kid, pulls on his jacket and
sets off in pursuit.

IN THE STREET

Abberline and Mary, collars turned up against the rain, splash through the puddles.
The street is getting busier. Neither of them notice the boy on the other side of the
toad shadowing them. The three of them fade into the crowd. The sound of thunder
carries over -

THE MARBLE ENTRANCE FOYER

of Lady Jane's house. !t's an hour later and the rain has turned to a full-fledged
storm. The Butler opens the front door. He looks askance at Abberline - sodden suit,
crumpled shirt, a day-and-a-half's stubble.

BUTLER
I'm not sure Her Ladyship is receiving

LADY JANE (0.S.)

way up the sweeping staircase. She stares at him -

LADY JANE
Good God - you don't look like you've
slept for days.

ABBERLINE
V don't think | have.

A MAGNIFICENT BEDROOM SUITE

Tall windows command a view of a garden. Fires burn in the bedroom, the sitting
room, the bathroom, the dressing room. A platoon of servants hurry back and forth,
drawing the bath, laying out towels and clothes. Abberline sits in an armchair, still in
his suit, barely noticing it all.

The Butler and two maids position a table in front of the windows and remove @
host of silver covers - eggs, beef, fruit, toast, juice, bacon, salmon. Breakfast. Lady
Jane takes Abberiline by the arm. They sit down at the table together. The Butler
and servants withdraw. Lady Jane picks up serving utensils -

You'll have to bear with me - I've never
done this before.
ABBERLINE

LADY JANE
Of course.
ABBERLINE

She looks at him. There's something in the way he's sitting - just perfectly still - but
suddenly she's afraid.

Will you be rewarded? | hardly think so.

He stares at her. She takes his hands in hers.

LADY JANE

we spoke about - everything's possible for
you. Why risk that?

Abberline looks at the luxurious room - silk drapes, Old Masters on the walls,
servants at beck and call. She smiles at him... perfect...

Netley is unshaven and ragged-iooking. Gull, in his overcoat, stares down at him -

BISHOPSGATE POLICE STATION

Abberline comes through the front door - he looks like he's dead on his feet. He
barely acknowledges the constable on the desk and goes into the rear of the station.
About half a dozen cops are gathered around a desk, looking at something. The
Sergeant turns and sees him -

SERGEANT
We got another letter, about an hour ago.

ABBERLINE
Good - file it with the other five hundred.

Abberline keeps walking. The anxiety, the fatigue - he's close to breaking point.

SERGEANT
Yeah, but it's the first to enclose part of
a human kidney. The doctor says the
length of artery matches exactly what
was left in Kate Eddowes’ body.

That stops him - he just stares. Then he turns and goes. The Sergeant follows him -

He turns on his heel and heads back out.

THE COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE

Gaslights are burning, it’s early evening. Sir Charles’ possessions are packed in
boxes. He sits behind his desk, listening to a uniformed constable.

TWO FLAGS

fly in a storm-driven wind. One is the Union jack, the other shows three gold lions
on a red field. This is the Royal Standard, the coat of arms of the kings and queens
of England. The flags fly atop Buckingham Palace.

THE ENTRANCE FOYER

of the palace is huge - all marble and gilt and a sweeping staircase. At the top of the
stairs, two uniformed soldiers - members of the elite Household Guard - stand on
either side of a pair of inlaid doors.

THE QUEEN'S STUDY

is a beautiful room - book-lined walls, Old Masters on either side of the fireplace,
windows that look straight up Pall Mall. Queen Victoria sits behind a priceless
Chippendale desk. She is almost seventy years old, a hard and uncompromising
woman. This is the fiftieth year of her reign and in that time the Empire she rules
has come to embrace a third of the world. She is speaking to someone we can't
see-

VICTORIA
Frankly, we are disappointed. As our
principal private secretary this was
your responsibility. Now look at it!
Questions in Parliament, protests -
where will it end?!

She turns - we see the man she is talking to. It's Lord Hailsham. He bows his head -

HAILSHAM
'm sorry, ma'am. As | said, | did
speak to him -

VICTORIA
And did he explain the necessity for
such excessive ghastliness?

HAILSHAM
He says the women are traitors - he
appears to have an encyclopedic
knowledge of the terrible ways in which
such people have been punished.
That's what he says - but | believe the
reason may be more prosaic.

The Queen looks at him, wanting him to continue.

HAILSHAM
As you know, Gull is a very disciplined
Man - and yet the murders are

the man has come to gain some form
of... physical satisfaction... from his
activities.

The Queen gets the meaning. She stares at him, sickened.

VICTORIA

One more woman, that's all, isn't it?
HAILSHAM

Yes.
VICTORIA

Tonight. We want it finished tonight.
Do we make ourselves clear?

ABBERLINE'S LODGING HOUSE

Gas lights are burning - it's night. An overnight bag is lying on the floor in
Abberline's suite of rooms. He is whirling through the place, grabbing clothes and
whatever possessions come to hand. He thrusts them in the bag and hesds for the
door.

Abberline is getting out. Two tickets for the steamer to Ireland lie on the hail table.
Abberline grabs them, takes one last look around the place, and goes out the door.

GARDENER’S COURT

is a group of old brick buildings built around a courtyard. At the front hangs a rusted
sign:

Rooms to Let
A steady rain, starting to turn to mist, pours down on it. Already the mist is
gathering like a cloak around the street lamps. The death carriage pulls up and parks
in a street alongside the rooming house.

Netley, bundied up against the weather, is on the driver's seat. Next to him is the
young boy from the stables - the one that followed Abberline and Mary.

The stable-boy points at a lighted window. Mary steps up to the glass and pulls
down the shade. The stable-boy turns to Netley and puts out his hand. Netley pays
him. The kid grins, swings off the coach and malts into the mist.

INSIDE THE POLICE STATION i

Abberline walks fast down a deserted corridor. He fishes a key from his pocket and
opens a heavy oak door - the evidence locker. He searches the shelves until he finds
what he's looking for - the revolver he took from the American seaman. He shrugs
off his jacket, swings the holster over his shoulder and pulls his jacket back on. He
fills a pocket with bullets.

OUTSIDE THE POLICE STATION

Abberline, carrying his overnight bag, comes out the front doors, straight into the
miserable night. The mist is turning to London fog. He looks for a cab - the line in
front of Liverpool Street station stretches forever. He curses, pulls up his collar and
starts walking fast.

BROOK STREET

The foul night muffles every sound. Lights are dimly visible in the row of elegant
homes. The front door of number seventy-four opens and Gull emerges from his
house. The death carriage is parked at the curb. He hurries towards it and climbs
inside.

A CORNER STORE

Mary is buying food for supper. The shopkeeper hands her the change - a five pound
note and some coins. She puts it in her pocket, buttons it closed and leaves.
Outside, people stand and watch three kids brawling over a penny. Another urchin
cruises the crowd. Mary pushes through the crowd. The urchin stumbles into Mary.
As she pushes him off, we see him slice the button off her pocket with a knife. The
kid has his hand in and out of her pocket before we can blink. Mary doesn't feel a

thing.

The pickpocket disappears into the crowd. His accomplices stop their brawling and
melt away.

THE DEATH COACH

is parked in the street alongside Gardener's Court. Gull and Netley watch Mery,
carrying her groceries, enter the front door of the building.

They turn to Mary's window, waiting for the lantern to be lit. Nothing happens. Gull
slaps his gloves back and forth, impatient.

GULL
Damned women... always gossiping.

Still the window remains unlit.

LIVERPOOL STREET

Steam and smoke from a train pulling into Liverpool Street station rolls through the
rain and fog. It almost obscures Abberline. He darts out into the road and succeeds
in flagging down a vacant cab.

ABBERLINE
(urgent)
Gardener‘s Court. You know it? Down
near Highgate.

Abberline climbs inside, Crack! The driver snaps his whip.

GARDENER'S COURT
At last the light goes on in Mary's room. Netley and Gull watch - thraugh the drawn
shade they see her pull her dress over her head and step out of her petticoat. We

push in on Gull's face - he can barely contain his excitement. He watches the naked
silhouette move across the room and extinguish the lantern.

THE CAB

crawls through a jumble of traffic. Abberline calls to the driver -

ABBERLINE
What's the trouble?

The driver points through the fog - ahead is an overturned milk cart, its horse tying
on its side, gallons of milk pouring out of the pails. It runs down the street, turning
the cobblestones a ghostly white. The traffic trundles slowly through it.

THE DEATH COACH

stands in the shadows. Netley is in the driver's seat, hunched up against the
weather, whistling tunelessly to himself. Mary's window is in darkness -

INSIDE MARY'S ROOM

A woman's sleeping figure is curled under the blankets, her back to the door. The
only light comes from the coals in the fireplace. The door inches open. Gull, carrying
the amputation kit, steps inside.

A LONG STREET

Abberline's cab skirts the overturned wagon. It accelerates fast down a fog-
shrouded, rain-slicked street.

MARY'S ROOM

Gull moves across the room. In the firelight he sees the familiar clothes, the photo
of the Irish cottage, the bottle of cheap scent. He stops at the side of the bed and
Grinks in the curled form - an erm stretched across the pillow, one breast partly
exposed.

GULL
{like a lover)
Hello, Mary -

She stirs under the covers. He whips the pillow out and rams it over her head. She
thrashes with her legs, trying to kick herself free, exposing her naked body. Gull
smiles at the whiteness of her. One handed, he selects a knife from the amputation
kit. He plunges the instrument down! It slices through the pillow and into her face.
She screams - a scream of primal pain. Not even the pillow can muffle it entirely.
The cry carries over -

A CAT

in an upstairs room catches the sound. It jumps from a table onto a bed, waking an
elderly woman. She sits up - another cry, or was it? Again she listens - nothing.

MARY'S ROOM

She's still alive - a rasping breathing comes from beneath the blood-soaked pillow.
Gull turns to the emputation kit and selects his favorite - the Liston knife. He pulls
aside the tangle of blankets - her body is completely unmarked. Not for long - he
makes two ritualistic cuts across her breasts. She jerks from the pain but there’s no
strength to it. Gull holds her down with one hand on the pillow.

He looks at the naked, bleeding body - he's sweating, his breathing fast and
shallow.
re OR i be beer

He positions himself between her legs and raises the knife above her stomach. He
slides it through her flash and lays open the abdominal cavity. Blood sprays. There's
8 reflex spasm then she lies still. Completely still.

ABBERLINE

is in the back of the fast-traveling cab. In his hand are the tickets to Ireland...

MARY'S ROOM

Gull has banked the fire into 8 roaring blaze - the iron kettle hanging above it is
starting to melt. The walls around the bed ere covered in blood. We barely glimpse
the body but we see that it is terribly mutilated - at least one arm has been severed
and what is left of the face is a mask of blood.

Gull walks to the fire with his instruments. He pushes the Liston knife and the
crooked bistoury into the flames, purifying them. The heat threatens to scorch him
but he is so euphoric, he barely notices.

THE DEATH COACH

is almost obscured in the fog and rain. Netley sees Gull approaching - he looks
exhausted but his eyes are shining bright. He seems to stagger as he opens the
coach door.

NETLEY
Are you all right, sir?

GULL
Perfectly. | have come through the fire.
I have stood in the Sea of Tranquillity
and seen the five rings of Saturn. "He

says, isn't it? “He is risen.”

As he gets in, he turns and looks once more at Netley. His voice is gentie -

GULL

work is finished. You've done your
duty. Go home, Netley.

Netley straightens himself up and snaps the reins. The coach heads into the
darkness.

down the stairs. She heads towards the open door of 8 bathroom then stops. She
lowers the lantern - a bloody footprint on the floor. Then another - she follows them

to Mary's door. ft stands ajar. She pushes it open and looks into the room. She
screams!

ambulance and 8 throng of people gathered outside the boarding house.

ABBERLINE
No...

He hurls the door open, scrambles out and runs -

THE CORRIDOR

outside Mary's room is packed. The local police try to bring some sort of order.
Abberline pushes through to a bluff-feced cop.

ABBERLINE

Where is she?

The cop inclines his head, indicating the room. Abberline looks inside - the blood
splattered walls, the crumpled form covered by a bloody sheet. The world reels...

cop
There's a bag by the wash-stand. It's got
a few things in it - a woman by the name
of Mary Kelly.

But Abberline barely hears. He steps inside the room. The cop, disinterested, turns
away. Abberline looks - the dress Mary was wearing the last time he saw her is
hanging in the closet. On the table is the photograph of her family in Ireland. He
reaches down and picks up a silk ribbon a woman uses to tie her bonnet. He runs
the fabric - her fabric - through his fingers.

Slowly he goes to the bed. As hard as it is, he has to look at her. He takes hold of
the sheet and draws it back. His eyes go to her face. But it's not really a face any

more - just a mutilated and bloody mess. We push in on him - the anguish and fury
overwhelm him. He's going to kill Gull! Conspiracy or not, he's going to kill him!

The houses in the street are in darkness - all except for number 74. Gas lights
illuminate the entrance to Gull’s home. A cab pulls up in front.

IN THE ENTRY HALL

A butler - dressed, but obviously roused from bed - crosses the marble foyer and
opens the front door, Abberline stands on the threshold. The butler looks the
disheveled figure up and down but before he can say anything, Gull - freshly bathed
and scented - appears at the top of the stairs. He and Abberline look at each other.
Gull comes forward, calm and pleasant -

GULL
' can only assume it's official business
that brings you out at such an hour.
What's happened, Inspector?

ABBERLINE
No, not official - personal.

Gull can't miss the anger in Abberline's voice but he's completely composed. He
smiles -

GULL
Then ! only hope | can be of help. Do
you mind the study, Inspector? Given
the hour, | think we can allow ourselves
a little informality, don't you?

Abberline is so wound up he barely makes sense of what Gull is saying. Gull ushers
him into -

THE STUDY
A fire still buns in the hearth. Gull takes a taper and starts to light the lamps.

GULL
if you can tell me, Inspector -

ABBERLINE
(interrupting)
You left something behind in Mitre Square.

For a fraction of a second it makes Gull pause but then he covers it, continuing his
task.

GULL
That's strange - 1 don't recall ever being
in Mitre Square.

---ABBERLINE ~
It's where Kate Eddowes was murdered.

GULL
Kate Eddowes? Really?

Abberline Says nothing. At last Gull turns and looks at him - Abberline is holding out
the white handkerchief. Gull stares at the bloody heel-print of the three-turreted
castle. A beat - then he laughs.

Abberline says nothing.

It stops Gull in his tracks.

GULL
Who would have thought it - the
vanity of hand-made shoes? A poorer
tan might have passed completely
unnoticed. It's hard not to appreciate
the irony of it, isn't it?

GULL
So, is that why you're here, inspector -
to arrest me? Because if you ere, !
think | should explain a number of
things to you. It could save you
substantial embarrassment -

ABSBERLINE
I know about Prince Edward.

GULL
So - the question about Annie Crook
wasn't just 8n idle inquiry then? | should
have realized. Well... | stand corrected,
Inspector - your reputation may be
deserved after all. As you know about
the Prince, there's no need for me to
say anymore, is there? You must
understand perfectly the favor and
protection in which Her Majesty holds
me.
123

ABBERLINE
Perfectly, Sir William. But I'm not here
to arrest you.

He draws the revolver out from under his jacket.

GULL
Now | understand - it's justice you want!

ABBERLINE
' wasn't sure you even knew the word,

GULL
Oh, | know it. But I'm afraid you're bound
to be disappointed. You won't find justice,
at least not here, Inspector.

ABBERLINE
There you go again - another under-
estimation. What do you call an
execution?

He raises the gun and points it straight at Gull.

GULL
And they'll hang you for it. They'll say
you murdered an innocent man. Is
that the justice you're looking for?!
Five women dead and the man who
knows the truth strung up at Newgate.
Will that restore your faith?

ABBERLINE
5 doubt it - but it'll do for now.

From outside, very faint, the sound of 2 carriage stopping. Neither Abberline or Gull
pay it any mind. Abberline cocks the hammer. The doctor stares straight down the
barrel.

GULL
1 did my duty, that's all! 1 was a loyal
servant of the Crown. If it's justice
you're looking for, what about them?
Shouldn't they be brought to account?
But they won't be, will they? It's only
you that will be punished. But go ahead
+ throw your life away. In the end, it
won't change a thing.

ABBERLINE
Good night, doctor. I'll bs looking at your
face. | want to see the bullet hit.

His finger starts to squeeze the trigger. He looks along the barrel, straight at Gull's
eyes. Behind the doctor, a flicker of movement. For a moment, Abberline racks
focus - he is looking through a set of french doors. Someone is hurrying up the front
steps - it's a woman. She turns and looks into the study. It’s Mary!

GULL
What is it, Inspector? Lost your nerve?

Mary walks up to the french doors. Abberline's hand on the gun starts to shake.

GULL
You can't do it, can you? Deep inside,
you believe in the law -

Abberline wrenches his eyes away from mary. he looks at Gull as if seeing him for
the first time. Abberline’s fist smashes out! The butt of the pistol crashes into Gull's
fleshy cheek. Crunch! The sound of breaking bone and teeth. Gull crumples,
uncenscious.

Abberline goes to the doors and unlatches them. Mary takes a step towards him and
he opens up his arms. She's rea! - he's holding her! They kiss - but only for a
moment. Abberline's mind is racing. He bustles her out along the front terrace.

ABBERLINE
\ don’t know what happened... but he
thinks he murdered you. You're dead,
Mary! And in killing you, he's given you
back your life. You're free, Mary!

MARY
But won't somebody identify -

ABBERLINE

I've seen the body. Believe me - they
can't,

Mary shudders. The cab Mary came in waits at the curb. They hurry towards it.
Abberline gives directions to the driver but we don't hear what they are.
INSIDE THE CAB

Abbarline climbs in and slams the door shut. The driver snaps the reins - the cab
takes off. Abberline turns and looks at her -
125

ABBERLINE
How, Mary... how?

MARY
1 went up the road to buy food for
supper. By the time | came back, my
pocket had been picked. I told the
landlady I'd lost my money - but she
wouldn't let me keep the room if |
couldn't pay, would she? People were
Queuing up. There was a young lass,
three months pregnant they said. The
landlady gave it to her.

ABBERLINE
{ was in the room - | saw your dress,
the photo -
MARY

1 told the landlady | could get money in
the morning. She said to leave my
things in the room, as security like.

She let me have the cheapest doss -

8 cupboard up near the attic. When |
heard women screaming, | took off.

{ tried to find you at the police station.
Then | realized... | guessed you'd
come here.

Again they look at one another - for the first time in weeks she almost smiles.

MARY
Where are we going?

ABBERLINE
Victoria Station.

MARY
And then?

ABBERLINE
{f anyone recognizes you, it’s over.
You've got to get out of London.

He pulls one of the steamer tickets and a bunch of banknotes out of his pocket. He
thrusts them into her hand.

So aarcom.

She looks at him -

ABBERLINE
There's a train to Portsmouth every
hour. From there you can take the
night boat to Ireland.
MARY ~
Home - that sounds like a fine place
‘to be. But no, Fred! Not without you.

ABBERLINE
I'll be coming.
MARY
When?
ABBERLINE
As soon as | can.
MARY
What are you going to do?
ABBERLINE
(softly)
I'm going to kill him.
MARY
Nol
ABBERLINE

Not like that. | should have thought of it
before. I'm going to kill him with my
head.

The cab stops in front of the huge Victoria railway station. Abberline looks up at the
station clock - it's five minutes before the hour.

ABBERLINE
Hurry!

MARY
Promise me, Fred.

ABBERLINE
1 promise.
127

She reaches out her arms and kisses him. And then again. She gets out of the cab
and walks towards the station. He watches her go.

ABBERLINE’S OFFICE
dawn is poking through the window. Abberiine sits at his desk, several files in front
of him. On top of one we see the title:

The Whitechapel Murders
aka
Jack the Ripper

A knock at the door. A young constable puts his head in.

CONSTABLE
There's a gentleman here to see you,
sir, He says he has an appointment but
he won't give his name.

Abberline gets to his feet. The door swings open. Ben Kidney of the Special Branch
walks in. Abberline puts out his hand -

ABBERLINE
Mr Kidney? It was good of you to
come.
KIDNEY

1 hope it's worth it, Inspector. | don’t like
being woken for nothing.

Abberline closes and bolts the door, Kidney notes it - hardly anything escapes his
attention - but says nothing.

ABBERLINE
(think you'll find it worthwhile. It
concerns the Whitechapel murders.
As you may know, t!
has been my responsibility.

 

KIONEY
I'm aware of that.

Abberline sits down behind his desk. He pauses, as if weighing the burden of what
he is about to say. He speaks quietly -
ABBERLINE

During the course of my inquiries, |

have come across a name. It's an

alias, Mr Kidney - | don’t know who the

person is - but he calls himself Albert

Vietor. TL
Even Kidney, as inscrutable as he is, sits forward. His cold eyes stare straight at
Abberline.

KIDNEY
Where did you hear this name?

ABBERLINE
From Sir William Gull. Which is why
| called you - my inquiries indicate that
on at least two occasions he has told
people that the murders are somehow
connected to 3 person of great rank. |
thought you should know of this.

KIDNEY
Did Sir William elaborate?

ABBERLINE
No. But to be honest, ! haven't pursued
it. I'm a loyal officer, Mr Kidney - I'm sure
there are some areas areas no
investigation should blunder into. If there
is any truth to what Sir William says, !
thought the thing to do was to put it in the
hands of those best equipped to deal with it.

KIONEY
That was exactly the right thing. And you're
sure he said nothing else?

ABBERLINE
Not that I know of.

KIDNEY
I'll take care of this. We'll have a talk to
Sir William.

He gets to his feet and shakes hands with Abberline.

People have told me you're a good
officer. Ambitious, they said. t seems a
man like you has an outstanding career

-ABBERLINE
{smiling)
I don't think so, Mr Kidney. I'm afriad |
decided some time ago to seek
opportunities elsewhere.

KIDNEY
That's a shame.

He walks to the door. he’s about to open it - then stops. He turns back -

KIDNEY
I'm sorry - | didn't ask you. What made
you come to me?

ABBERLINE
That was the easy part. | spoke to 8
friend. | asked him - “Who will help the
widow's son?”

Kidney smiles warmly.

KIDNEY
Good day, Inspector.

ABBERLINE
Good day, Superintendent.

BROOK STREET

it's the morning of the same day. Gull leads Lord Hailsham and Kidney across the
foyer end into his study. He closes the door and speaks to Hailsham -

GULL
1 was going to call on you this morning
- we've got a problem.

KIDNEY
We certainly do.
130

Before Gull can say anything, there's a noise behind him. He turns - Tom Press,
Garret Brack and several other members of the Special Branch come through the
doors. A look of confusion, panic crosses Gull’s face. He spins back to Hailsham -
Kidney is waiting for him. He grabs Gull's arm and drives it up behind his back - the
doctor cries out in pain. Tom Press has the handcuffs on before Gull even realizes.

THE QUEEN'S STUDY
A middle-aged man stands nervously in front of Queen Victoria.

VICTORIA
As a surgeon, Sir Richard, are we right
in saying that the removal of the thyroid
gland can have devastating effects on
memory?

SIR RICHARD
That's quite right, Your Majesty.

VICTORIA
And there are medical conditions which
would lead a doctor to perform such an
operation?

SIR RICHARD
Most certainly, ma’am.

VICTORIA
Even under unusual circumstences, 3
doctor could find ethical reasons for
undertaking such an operation - am
I right, Sir Richard?

SIR RICHARD
There can be no higher ethical reason
than the opportunity to serve Queen and
country, ma’am.

Victoria inclines her head and smiles, acknowledging his loyalty.

VICTORIA
Excellent, Sir Richard.

Passengers line the decks of the night boat to Ireland. Mary stands near the
gangplank, watching the crowd on the wharf. There's no sign of Abberline. The
ship's whistle blows - seamen start to cast off the stern lines. o

She turns away, downcast. Then, out of the comer of her eye, she seos something.
She turns back - it's him! Abberline is running down the wharf, carrying the
overnight bag, heading for the gangplank. She tries to smile but she's too close to
tears. She goes towards him - halfway down the gangplank they meet. He takes her
in his arms. They kiss.

BEDLAM

is the name of England's worst lunatic asylum. In a stone-walled cavern, men
dressed in nightshirts, some of them shackled, walk in an endless circle. One man
stands out - his nightshirt still white, not yet soiled by years of incarceration. It's
Gull.

The once bright eyes are vacant, disoriented now. He stumbles into the circling

mass. Slowly he starts to walk. We pull back to reveal room after room - hundreds
of men are circling endlessly, his companions in the seventh ring of Hell.

THE COAST OF IRELAND

appears out of the mist. We draw closer. In the first light of day it looks like a land
born brand new. Abberline and Mary stand on the deck of the boat staring out at it.
Mary turns and looks at Abberline. She speaks softly -

MARY
Home.

Abberline puts his arm around her shoulder. They stand togather, the land coming
closer, the sun rising higher by the second.
