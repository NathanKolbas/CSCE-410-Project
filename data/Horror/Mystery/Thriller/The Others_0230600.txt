_ THE OTnen
by ,

Alejandro Amendbar

“” Over a black and white illustration showing a star-studded sky, a rising sun, a lake,

palm trees, a fawn and two children holding hands, we hear the persuasive, dulcet tones
of a woman's voice.

GRACE’S VOICE
Now listen carefully while I tell you a very beautiful story.
It began many thousands of years ago, though it ended in
only seven days. None of the things we can see now...the
sun, the moon, the’stars, the earth, the animals and
plants...not a single one existed. Only God existed, and

so only He could have made them. And that’s just what he
did...

The drawing dissolves into other similar ones while the credit titles are introduced. The
illustrations show scenes from the film, but sufficiently modified so as to suggest the
essence of the story without giving away the key facts of the plot.

1. THE HOUSE. FACADE. EXTJ/DAY.

Dawn breaks

Long distance shot of an enormous, Victorian style house. A dense wood spreads out
around it. A thin, wispy layer of fog covers the ground.

Only the whisper of the breeze can be heard and perhaps the distant screaming of a
seagull. ,

A subtitle reads:

Jersey, the Channel Islands, 1945

2. THE HOUSE. GRACE’S BEDROOM. INT/DAY.
Close up of GRACE, letting rip a blood-curdling scream. Suddenly, she becomes silent,
her eyes red and staring. She takes several deep breaths in order to regain her

composure. As the camera pulls back, we see that she is in bed.

_ Beads of sweat glisten on her forehead.

’ GRACE is a very attractive woman, in her early thirties, of a somewhat delicate but, at

the same time, stern appearance. She sits up and anxiously rubs her head. Then she
checks the clock on her bedside table and gets out of bed.

3. THE HOUSE. FACADE. EXT.DAY.
a
The house can now be seen more clearly in th growing light.

Three figures walk slowly towards the main door’ They are BERTHA, a woman of
about sixty, kind-faced and pleasantly plump; Mr. TUTILE, an old man in his seventies,
lean and with a splendid white moustache, and LYDIA, a young girl with a melancholy

expression and a faraway look All three are dressed in a manner that strikes us as old-
fashioned, even for 1945.
BERTHA and TUTTLE are laughing.

BERTHA

Ab, good old Mr. Simpson...whatever became of him, I
wonder?

TUTILE
Oh, I imagine he’s dead, like all the rest.

BERTHA
(sighing)
Ah, those were the days...

They stop in front of the door. BERTHA, who appears to be the best dressed of the
three, rings the doorbell and then looks her two companions up and down, as if she
were inspecting them. She combs her hand through the old man's white hair.

BERTHA
Mg. Tuttle, when are you going to learn to comb your hair
properly?

TUTILE nods as he raises a hand to his head.

TUTTLE
Oh, my hair, ay, o’course, my hair.

The door half opens and GRACE appears.

BERTHA
(smiling)
Good morning, ma’am. We've come about...

GRACE
Yes, of course, come in. (She opens wide the door). 1
didn’t expect you so soon.

BERTHA, TUTTLE and LYDIA exchange puzzled looks... -,

4
GRACE

(Rather forcefully)
Well, come in, then.

4. THE HOUSE. ENTRANCE HALL. INTJDAY.

— They enter the house. The hall has a rather dismal air about it, boasts very litle
furniture and in general seems dull and grey. However, its spaciousness and
architecture are impressive.

GRACE
(closing the door and looking at BERTHA)
You are...?
- BERTHA
Bertha Gray, ma’am. And this is Edmund Tuttle.
TUTILE
(politely shaking GRACE's hand)
Pleased to meet you, ma’am.
GRACE
You must be the gardener.
: TUTILE
7) Ay, that’s right, the gerdener...though I can turn my hand
to most things, if needs be.
GRACE
Well, I’m sure you'll find plenty to keep you busy around
here.
BERTHA

And this young lady’s called Lydia
| GRACE looks the young girl up and down, making her shrink away in embarrassment.

GRACE
Hmm, I was hoping for someone a little more experienced.

BERTHA
Oh, don’t let that baby face fool you, ma’am. She’s older
than she looks.

GRACE
Have you had much experience of being in service?

 

LYDIA nods.

cS

 

    

Can you iron?

She nods again.

GRACE
What’s the matter? Has the cat got your tongue?

The girl looks at BERTHA, as if seeking her help.

BERTHA

She can’t talk, ma’am. The poor giri’s a mute.
GRACE

Mute!?
BERTHA

But she’s a good little worker, ma’am, I promise you.

GRACE

Well, all right. The girl I had before talked too much
anyway. Follow me.

They cross the hall. To their right is a wide, uncarpeted staircase; the
have been worn down by years of use.

GRACE
(to BERTHA and the girl)
You two can sleep in the attic, at the top of the stairs. (To
TUTTLE:) You can use the shed round the back. As you
can see, there’s dust everywhere; but it’s five days now
since anyone cleaned up.

BERTHA
What happened to the servants, madam?

. GRACE

Last Monday they all disappeared. They didn’t give me
any motice...they didn’t even collect their wages or take
their belongings with them.

They reach a side door. GRACE takes outa huge bunch of keys.

BERTHA
Why on earth did they do that?

GRACE
There are days when this house isn't the best place to live,
as you'll soon discover. That's why I put the
advertisement in the newspaper asking for honest,

_ hardworking people, as I’m sure you understand,

 

wooden steps
O

 

O

BERTHA
Oh, yes, ma’am. There’s none more honest and
hardworking than us, is there, Mr. Tuttle?

TUTTLE
(Absentmindedly)
Oh, ay, we're very honest...

GRACE opens the door and enters...

5. THE HOUSE. KITCHEN. INTJDAY.

«the kitchen. It is spacious and rather more welcoming than the rest.
TUTTLE
...And very...hardworking.

GRACE gives the old man a suspicious look, as she locks the door behind her.

GRACE
The kitchen. I have breakfast at eight and the children ¢ at
nine. Lunch is at one and dinner at half past seven.

BERTHA
What about the master?

Silence. For a second, GRACE seems thrown by the question, but she quickly pulls
herself together.

GRACE
The master was killed in the war a year and a half ago.
Which of you does the cooking?
BERTHA
I'm so sorry, madam.
GRACE
Which of you does the cooking?
BERTHA
We both cook, madam.
GRACE
(to LYDIA)

Let’s see, you can take charge of cleaning the bedrooms
every day, and at least three other rooms: the dining room,
the kitchen, and the bathrooms...do you understend?

LYDIA nods vehemently.
GRACE
The rooms are all very large, but contain very litle
furniture, so they won't give you a lot of trouble. And you
can prepare lunch, too.

Se BERTHA
What about me, ma’am?

6. THE HOUSE. HALL - PASSAGE. INT/DAY.

GRACE leaves the kitchen and walks down a narrow passage towards a
door. The servants follow her.

GRACE
You can help her whenever she needs a hand. How old are
you? Sos

BERTHA and MR. TUTILE exchange a rather knowing look

BERTHA
Sixty-six.

GRACE
(searching among the keys
. for the right one to open the door)
“ I assume you've looked after children before.

BERTHA

Actually, they’re my speciality, ma’am. I adore litte
kiddies.

GRACE opens the door and they go through...
7. THE HOUSE. MUSIC ROOM. INT/DAY.

.uinto the music room. It is completely empty, except for a grand piano standing in the
corner.

GRACE
You may not think that once you’ve met the twins. They
aren’t like other children. Have you noticed what I am
doing? (She locks the door). In this house you must not
open any door without first locking the previous one. It’s
vital that you remember this. Bertha, fom tomorrow
onwards I'm leaving the keys in your charge.

 

BERTHA
Yes, ma'am.
O

 

 

. GRACE

This is the music room. That old piano was already here
when we moved in. Don’t let the children thump away on
it, it sets my migraine off. Silence is something we value
highly in this house. That’s why we don’t have a

telephone, a radio or anything else that makes a lot of
noise, Let’s continue...

BERTHA
Ma’am, there’s no need for you to show us round the
whole house, we already...

GRACE
On the contrary. Because, half the time, you never know
where you are in this house. You're quite likely to bump
into a table, a sideboard, a door, or one of my children
playing Hide-And-Seek.

BERTHA ©
What do you mean?

Silence.
GRACE
Perhaps I’d better introduce you to the children.

8. THE HOUSE. HALL. INT/DAY.

The group returns to the hall. GRACE approaches a sideboard on which there is an oil
lamp.

GRACE
Mr. Tuttle, you can go to the garden now. You'll find
tools in the shed.

TUTTLE
Yes, ma’am.

The old man leaves, as GRACE picks up a box of matches from beside the oil lamp.
GRACE
(lighting the lamp)

You nwo can start closing all the curtains.

BERTHA
Yes, ma’am.

BERTHA gestures to LYDIA to close the curtains of an enormous window to the right,
while she takes care of the oneion the left.
O

The hall is plunged into darkness: the only light is the dim glow of the oil lamp.
GRACE moves to the foot of the staircase. The stairs disappear into thé darkness.

GRACE
Follow me upstairs.

Rather apprehensively, BERTHA and LYDIA begin to follow GRACE up the stairs.
9. THE HOUSE. 2°” FLOOR LANDING. INT./DAY.

They reach the top floor. GRACE turns to the right and walks down a narrow passage

until she reaches a door. The light is so faint that it is difficult to make out the
furnishings. -

GRACE places the oil lamp on a small table.

GRACE
I’m going to wake them. Wait here. (Before entering the
room, she turns to the servants and whispers:) Whatever
you do, don’t open the curtains.

BERTHA shakes her head. GRACE disappears into the darkness.

BERTHA and LYDIA’s eyes meet in the flickering light of the oil lamp. The young girl
seems a little scared.

Over the shot of their faces, we hear GRACE waking her children.

GRACE
(of)
Have you had a good sleep, my little angels? (Kisses)
Come on, time to get up. I want you to say hello to

someone.
ANNE'S VOICE
Are they here already?
GRACE
(of)

Yes.

ANNE'S VOICE
What are they like?

GRACE
(of

Like the rest. No better, no worse.

10

 
ANNE'S VOICE
Are they going to leave us, toa?

GRACE
© ‘S
No one’s going to leave us. Now, come on, hands
together.

ANNE & NICHOLAS
Blessed be, at light of day,
Jesus, to whom now I pray.
Blessed be the Virgin pure
Whom I greet with faith so sure.
Blessed be St. Joseph, too,
Faithful husband, good and true.
Jesus, Mary, Spotless Rase,
Keep us till the day doth close.

GRACE appears in the doorway with her two children, one either side. ANNE and .
NICHOLAS are about seven or eight years old. Their faces are extremely pale, almost

as white as the nightgowns they are wearing. NICHOLAS rubs his eyes, as if the light
of the lamp dazzled him.

GRACE
They're still half-asleep.

.

BERTHA leans forward, resting her hands on her knees.

BERTHA
What sweet little children!
GRACE
Well? What do you say?
NICHOLAS
‘Lo.
ANNE
‘Lo.
GRACE
No, “low” is the noise cows make. Now speak properly.
NICHOLAS
Good morning.
ANNE

 

Good morning.

 
 

BERTHA

Good moming, children. My name's Bertha and this is Lydia. And what
are you called? :

7 The children do not answer.

\_ GRACE
Don’t take all day.
ANNE
Anne.
NICHOLAS
Nicholas.
-- BERTHA

Anne and Nicholas. What pretty names!

ANNE
Are you going to be our nanny?

BERTHA looks at GRACE, as though waiting for her approval. GRACE nods.

BERTHA
Yes, my dears. I’m your new nanny.

ii GRACE

It’s time for their breakfast. Lydia, (handing her the
bunch of keys), go to the kitchen and close the shutters.

LYDIA obeys and disappears into the darkness.
GRACE takes the oil lamp and walks ahead with the children, followed by BERTHA.

GRACE
The doctors were never able to find a solution. The
children are’-photosensitive, or in other words, they’re
allergic to light. They must never be exposed to light
stronger than this. Otherwise in a matter of minutes,
they'd break out in sores and blisters and would begin to
suffocate. It would eventually be fatal.

BERTHA
Good Heavens!

GRACE
As I said before, living in this house is not easy for
es . someone who's not used to it. The slightest strange sound,
a creak, 2 door, a gust of wind, seems completely different
in the dark. Are you easily scared? Do you believe in
ghosts and all that nonsense? Lo

12
 

BERTHA
No, ma’am...not so far.

GRACE
Good, good...

10. THE HOUSE. KITCHEN. INT/DAY.

A candle lights the table in the centre of the kitchen. ANNE and NICHOLAS, sitting
opposite each other, are both half-heartedly eating a slice of toast.

BERTHA stands with her back to them, in front of the cooker.

- BERTHA .
Your milk’s almost ready, children. Your mother told me
you were not to leave a crumb.

ANNE
T don’t like it.

BERTHA
(turning towards the girl)
What don’t you like?

ANNE
This toast.
BERTHA
Why not? * .
ANNE

Tt tastes funny. I liked it better before.

BERTHA
That’s because, before, somebody else made it.

ANNE
When are they coming back?

BERTHA
They won't be coming back, Anne.

NICHOLAS
Just like daddy.

The children exchange looks. BERTHA wrings her hands. The boy's remark has made
’ her feel uncomfortable.
 

O

&

 

. ANNE
But daddy is coming back, though. Nanny, did you know
our father is fighting in the war in France?

NICHOLAS
It’s the World War.

ANNE
T know, but he’s in France.

BERTHA
(turning back to the cooker)
That’s enough talking...finish your food.

Silence. -
ANNE
(in a deliberately enigmatic tone)
T know why she left.
BERTHA
Who?
ANNE

The other nanny. And all the other servants.

NICHOLAS stops. chewing his toast.

. NICHOLAS
(coldly)
Shut up.
ANNE
They couldn’t stand mummy. Especially after what
happened the other day. .
BERTHA turns round.
BERTHA
What happened?
ANNE
She went mad.
NICHOLAS
Nothing happened.
ANNE

Yes it did.
 

NUCL

No it didn’t!

ANNE
Yes, it did!

GRACE
Quiet!

We don't know exactly when, but GRACE has entered the kitchen. She walks towards
the table, glaring at the children.
GRACE
(with restrained anger)

What's going on? I want to see those plates empty in less

than a minute. And don’t think for one moment that

anything is going to change in this house. There'll be no

talking at breakfast. Ever. Is that clear?

The children nod as they chew their food.

GRACE |
(with a suddenly gentle, almost seductive tone)
Anne, what were you saying when I came in?

ANNE
(with the same smoothness)
Nothing, mummy.

GRACE observes her daughter in silence. She seems about to scold her, but at the last
minute she checks herself...

GRACE
I want you dressed and ready in the study room by half

past ten. Bertha, come outside 2 moment, I want 2 word
with you.

BERTHA
Yes, ma’am.

11. THE HOUSE. HALL. INT/DAY.
GRACE draws the curtains of a large window and turns to face BERTHA.

GRACE
The postman comes every Wednesday, but I’ve just
checked and this week he didn’t.

BERTHA
Um afraid I don’t follow.

 
(L

GRACE takes a letter from the pocket of her dress.

GRACE .
I left this letter in the post-box five days ago. It contains
the add I intended to put in the newspaper asking for

servants to live in. So how come you are here if this letter
was never delivered?

BERTHA
Oh, now I understand. Well, you see, ma'am, that’s
exactly what I was about to explain to you when you
answered the door and invited us in. We didn’t come in
answer to the advertisement.

- GRACE
Who sent you then? -

BERTHA .
No one, madam. We just came by on the off chance. A
big house like this needs to be looked after. by someone
who knows the ropes.

GRACE
You mean you've served in a house like this one before?

BERTHA
It may come as a surprise, ma’am, but we did, in fact, use
to work here. A few years ago...and if you don’t mind me
_saying so, they were the best years of my life. That's why
we came by, because this house means a lot to us...2 lot.
Perhaps I'd better show you our credentials and then you
can decide for yourself...

GRACE
No. Don’t bother, it’s not necessary. So, you say you
know the house well?

BERTHA
Like the back of my hand...(Smiling)...Well, always
assuming the walls haven't upped and moved since then.

For the first time, GRACE gives an almost imperceptible hint of a smile.

GRACE
The only thing that moves here is the light. From one side
to the other...Everything changes. (She sighs and
approaches the window) It's...cather inconvenient, to say
the least, one might almost say unbearable. And the only
way of enduring it is by keeping a cool head.

 

 
C)

 

BERTHA

Yes, ma’am.
GRACE
I don’t like...fantasies...strange ideas. Do you know what
I mean?
BERTHA

I think so, madam. You told me before that...

GRACE
My children sometimes have strange ideas, but you
mustn't pay any attention to them. Children will be

children.
BERTHA
(somewhat confused)
Of course, ma’am.
Silence.
GRACE
Allright, you can stay. I’Ll write to the newspaper anyway
just to clear this matter up.
GRACE turns and walks off.

. BERTHA
Thank you very much, ma’am.

GRACE nods her head slightly and disappears into the shadows.
12. THE HOUSE. KITCHEN. INT/DAY.

BERTHA.enters the kitchen once more and begins to clear the cable. The children are
drinking from their mugs.

ANNE
(taking her mug from her mouth)
It did happen.
She carries on drinking.
Fade out.

13. THE HOUSE. FACADE. EXT/DAY.

Fade in.

Long distance shot of the house. Mr. TUTILE is raking dead lecves.

14. THE HOUSE. GRACE’S BEDROOM. INTVJDAY.

Close up of GRACE screaming, as we saw in Sequence 2. She shows signs of having
cried.

She sits up as we hear someone knock at the door.

BERTHA
(of)

Are you feeling all right, ma’am?

. ~ GRACE
(feigning calmness)
Yes.

“15. THE HOUSE. KITCHEN. INT/DAY.

As she eats breakfast, GRACE gazes into space, her expression distorted, as if
tormented by some thought.

BERTHA
You've had that nightmare again, haven't you, ma’am?
GRACE nods.

GRACE
Pass me the sugar, please.

BERTHA
(placing a sugar bowl on the table)
Why don’t you tell me about it? Sometimes it helps...

: GRACE
No!...what I mean is...telling a dream is almost as absurd

as dreaming it. I'll get over it (She looks at her watch).
It’s time to wake the children.

BERTHA
Yes, ma’am.

16. THE HOUSE. STUDY ROOM. INT/DAY.

GRACE and her owo children are sitting round « small table. A candle in the centre
Sheds enough light for them to read by.

NICHOLAS
(reading)
“Ona certain occasion, two children called Justus and
Pastor, refused to worship...” :

C) GRACE

Just a minute. Where’s the stress on Pastor?

ANNE puts her hand up.

ANNE
(whispering)
Me, me, me...
- GRACE
No, let him answer, where’s the stress?
NICHOLAS
On the “2”.
GRACE

On the “a”. So it’s pronounced...

NICHOLAS
(after a moment's hesitation)

any Pastor.
GRACE

Pastor. Not pastor. Start again.

NICHOLAS
“On a certain occasion, two children, called Justus and
Pastor, refused to worship the false gods of the Romans.
They said: ‘We are Christians and we only worship the
true God’. The Roman governor tied to change their
minds afterwards...”

GRACE

“To make them change their minds.” Full stop. “Afterwards...”
NICHOLAS
“Afterwards, he ordered them to be beaten. But Justus and
Pastor...”
GRACE
Pastor.
’ :
. NICHOLAS —

| “Justus and Pastor...far from being afraid, rejoiced and
showed themselves ready to die for Christ. When he saw
| this, the Roman governor became very angry and ordered
their heads to be cut off.”
|

ed ANNE lets slip a giggle. GRACE glares at her. Her laughter is infectious and it is not
long before NICHOLAS follows suit.

GRACE
What do you find so amusing? Well, Anne, where’s the
joke?
ANNE
Weill... .
| GRACE
Well, what?
ANNE
Those children were really stupid.
GRACE
Why?
, ANNE
ay, Because they said they only believed in Jesus and then got
killed for it.
GRACE

Ah, and what would you have done? Deny Christ?

ANNE
Well, yes. Inside, I'd have believed in him. But I
wouldn't have told the Romans that.

, GRACE
Is that what you think, too, Nicholas?

NICHOLAS, rather more reserved than his sister, hangs his head, but eventually nods.

GRACE
I see. So you would have both lied, to the point of
denying Christ. And that way you'd have avoided the
Romans cutting off your heads...But what would have
happened afterwards?

 

ANNE
When?

20
&

 

 

 

GRACE
In the next life, the one that’s waiting for us after we die.
Where would you have gone?

ANNE
Oh, oh.
GRACE
Oh, oh...where, Nicholas?
NICHOLAS
To the children’s Limbo.
GRACE
And what is the children’s Limbo?
NICHOLAS
One of the four Hells.
GRACE
(to ANNE)
What are...?
ANNE
(reciting)

There’s the hell where the damned go, then there’s
Purgatory, and Limbo, or the Bosom of Abraham, where
the Just go, and the Limbo where children go.

GRACE
At the centre of the Earth. Where it’s very, very hot.
That’s where children go who tell lies. But remember,
they don’t just go there for a few days, oh no. They’re
damned forever, till the end of eternity. Think about it.
Try to imagine the end of eternity. Come on, close your
eyes and imagine it.

The children close their eyes, screwing up their eyelids very tightly.

ANNE
I’m getting dizzy.

GRACE
That’s what etemity’s like...for ever...pain forever. Now
do you understand why Justus end Pastor told the sruth?

The children nod seriously.

 
Ve

Right, open your readers at Lesson 6.

ANNE
Can’t we go and play?

GRACE
You most certainly cannot. First you're going to read the
lesson and learn it by heart.

ANNE
All of it?!

GRACE
Anne, any more protests and there'll be no playing for you
at all today. You can study in separate rooms...

: ANNE & NICHOLAS
No, no, no!
GRACE
Yes, yes, yes...!
ANNE

But we get scared if we’re separated.

GRACE

You get scared...! As if you weren’t used to this house by
now.

NICHOLAS
What if we see a ghost?

GRACE
Has your sister been telling you one of her stories?

ANNE
Thaven’t told him anything.

GRACE
Well, if you see a ghost, say hello and carry on studying.
Anne, come with me to the music room.

GRACE
Darling, I can’t be with you all the time. You must leam
to be on your own. Let's see, where’s your rosary?

The boy pulls a rosary from his pocket.

GRACE
Whenever you feel afraid, squeeze it with all your might
and say the Lord's Prayer, and then your fear will go
away. .

NICHOLAS
Tt won't...

GRACE
Yes, yes it will. Honestly. Don’t you see that when you
do that, the Lord is with you? There’s no reason to be

afraid.
ay NICHOLAS nods. GRACE leaves the room.

Silence.
NICHOLAS fingers the rosary, es if it would bring him luck Then he opens his reader
at Lesson 6. The title of the text is:

THE HOUSE AND THE FAMILY

 

7 On the right hand page there is an illustration showing, in bold outlines, a man dressed
in a suit and tle, reading the newspaper in an armchair. In the background, a woman in
an apron is tying the cord on a curtain. Seated on the floor, a child is playing with an
electric train. In another armchair an old woman sits knitting. Next to her, a girl is
playing with a doll.

NICHOLAS
(reading)
“We all live in a house with our family. The main rooms
in the house are: the Kitchen, the dining room, the
bedrooms, and the bathroom...”

17. THE HOUSE. HALL. INT/DAY.

GRACE enters the hall, locking the door behind her. The curtains are open: outside it
is gloomy and overcast.

BERTHA is dusting with a feather duster.

GRACE

tite Bertha, tell Lydia not to go into the music room. My
daughter is studying.
BERTHA

Yes, ma'am. She can’t anyway...I’ve got the key. How
did you get on with the children?

GRACE flops into a chair and closes her eyes.

. GRACE
The same as usual. In the momings they’re particularly
naughty.

BERTHA

They’re unsettled. It’s natural.

GRACE
They have to pay more attention during their lessons,
otherwise I'll never have them. ready for their First
Communion.

GRACE
In which case, he should have got in touch with me. I
realise this house isn’t the easiest place to get to, but he
oe knows full well that the children can’t go out.

BERTHA
Don’t they ever play outside?

GRACE
Not during the day. That’s why we bought such 2 big
house and got rid of most of the firniture...so they could

I don’t believe it! The postman’s another one who hasn’t
shown up for over a month. I’m beginning to feel totally
cut off from the world.

BERTHA
I’m sure it must be on account of the fog.

‘GRACE _
It’s never lasted this long before. Even the seagulls have
gone quiet.

BERTHA
Ma’am, if you like, the next time I go into to town, I can
ask after them. -

GRACE

Yes, I suppose you better had. I'd go myself, bur I still
can’t bring myself to leave the house, even just for a
couple of hours. I don’t know what I’d do if anything
happened to the children while I was out.

BERTHA
Don’t say such things, ma’am. I'll just go and get those letters.

ashamed.

Idon’t. IfI’d been crying, I'd tell you.

Victor.

ANNE
(as if it were cbvious)
The boy who was here a moment ago. I told him to let me
study, but he wouldn't stop crying. I told him: “When my
mother comes and sees [ haven’t learned my lesson, I'll be
in trouble”. But he didn’t care. I think he’s a spoilt brat.
He said we have to leave the house.

GRACE gives a wry smile.

GRACE
Oh, really? You don’t say. And why was he crying?

ANNE
Because he doesn’t like this house but he has to live here.
You see, his father’s 2 pianist and...

GRACE
Ab, so he’s 2 pianist, is he?

ANNE
Yes. He says that this house is just what he’s looking for
and that they’re going to move in and live here. I’ve
already told him that he’s not allowed to touch the
piano,...be isn’t, is he, muramy?

GRACE
So, you’ve spoken to his father as well?
~ ANNE
No, only with Victor. His father is with the others in the
hall.

GRACE
I’ve just come from the hall and there was no one there.

ANNE
They must have gone upstairs: They’re viewing the house.
Where are they going to sleep, mummy? [hope you don’t
give them our room.

GRACE

(rising from the piano stool)
That'll do, Anne. I've had quite enough of your stories.
Why were you crying?

ANNE
Mummy, it was Victor.

GRACE takes c deep breath, in an attempt (0 contain her anger.

So where is he now?

ANNE

dD He went out through there.

GRACE
Do you mind telling me how that boy could get in and out
of this room if it was locked...?

32. THE HOUSE. HALL. INT/DAY.

GRACE walks up and down the room. BERTHA and LYDIA stand in the centre, looking
rather distressed. ,

& GRACE

I thought I made it quite clear! Rule number one: no door
is to be opened before the previous one has been closed.
Is that so herd to understand? This house is like a ship.
The light has to be contained as if it were water, by
opening and closing the doors. The health of my children
is at stake!

| BERTHA |
But, ma’am, [...

 

GRACE
But madam nothing! I'll have no excuses! Who was the
last person to enter that room? Lydia?

The girl looks down and shakes her head.

BERTHA
She hasn't got a key, I already told you.

: GRACE
Well, that leaves you, then.

 
 

BERTHA
T was in the hall the whole time. Then I went into the
garden. Madam, you saw me with your own eyes.

co) GRACE

a T hope you’re not suggesting it was me! Do you think I’m
’ capable of such an oversight, of endangering the life of my
' own daughter?

t BERTHA looks the other way, lost for an answer.
GRACE takes a key from the key ring and places it in BERTHA’s hand.

Right, as from today;1’m holding you entirely responsible
for the music room...and ‘for anything that happens to the
children as well. .

shoulder. He turns round with a start. Behind him there is only darkness.

ANNE giggles.

NICHOLAS

NICHOLAS looks silently at his sister. Then he reacts.

NICHOLAS
You're a liar and I’m going to tell mummy.
ANNE
So I’m a liar, am 1?
NICHOLAS

Yes, and you're going to end up in Limbo.

ANNE looks into the darkness at the back of the room, berween the wall and a
cupboard.

ANNE
Victor, come out of that comer so my stupid brother can

see you.

NICHOLAS jerks round, wrapping himself in his sheets, with his back to his sister.

(in a thin voice)
Leave me alone.

Nae So now you don’t want to see him, eh? You're a cowardy

NICHOLAS sits there in silence, still wrapped tightly in his sheets. Behind him we see
the silhouette of his sister, dark and unfocused.

ANNE's outline leaves the bedside dnd moves towards the window.

As we focus on NICHOLAS's face, we hear the curtains being closed. The room is left

ANNE returns to the bed.
Almost immediately we hear the noise of the curtains being thrown open again.

ANNE tuts in annoyance.

ANNE
That’s enough, Victor... Nicholas...Nicholas. Tell him to
leave the curtains alone. He won't listen to me.

VICTOR'S VOICE
(in an angry whisper)

Stop it! Get off my bed, both of you!

NICHOLAS gives a start and hunches up even more. His breathing quickens.

ANNE
(coldly)
This is our bed.
VICTOR’S VOICE
No, it’s mine.
NICHOLAS

Anne, please, stop putting on that voice.

‘ANNE

Help! Mummy! Help!...

‘He pummels the door. A hand shoots out from behind him and covers his mouth.

GRACE rushes into the room, followed by BERTHA.

NICHOLAS clings on to his mother, in floods of tears. GRACE comforts him, stroking
his hair. Then she glares at ANNE. The girl, seated on the bed, is a picture of
innocence.

GRACE
What’s been going on here?

NICHOLAS
(between sobs)
She was frightening me and...I told her to shut up
ye and...and...

- GRACE
(approaching the girl)
I'm fed up, d’you bear me?...fed up of your stories!
” You're a wicked little girl!

ANNE
(insolently)
I didn’t do anything.

GRACE strikes her. The girl falls off the bed.

GRACE
A nasty, wicked little girl!

GRACE picks the girl up from the floor and continues beating her mercilessly.

ANNE's screams mix with those of NICHOLAS who runs to his mother and pulls at her
waist. .

NICHOLAS
Noooo!

GRACE continues hitting the girl, who by now is bleeding at the mouth. BERTHA,
observes the scene from the doorway, uneasily.

NICHOLAS
You promised, mummy, you promised! You promised!

BERTHA
Ma’am, please, stop it!

GRACE stops, as if suddenly conscious of what she's doing. ANNE crouches,
trembling, in @ corner. Her pale skin is covered in red patches, as a result of the
- beating.

garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which
tured every way, to keep the way of the tee of life.”

GRACE enters the hall, closing the door behind her.

ANNE
I’ve finished.

GRACE
(climbing the stairs to join her) .
Very good. Now you can ask the Virgin for forgiveness.

ANNE
What!? That’s not what we agreed.

GRACE
(taking the Bible)

being punished and you'll do as I say.

You can't make me ask the Virgin for forgiveness.

But you love making up stories! Don’t you realise you're
perverting your brother’s mind with all this nonsense
about ghosts and fairies...

ANNE
Before, I was making it all up. Now it’s tue.

GRACE adopts an attitude of patience. She crouches down so that she can look her

daughter in the eye.

. GRACE
Anne, remember the story of Justus and Pastor. Children
who don’t tell the truth end up in Limbo.

ANNE
That’s what you say. But I read the other day that Limbo

is only for children who haven't been baptised. And T
have.

Pause. GRACE stands up.

GRACE
Oh, so clever clogs has learned to read on her own, has
she? Very weil...(She hands her the Bible again)...since
you find it so enjoyable and informative, you can continue
to stand here for three hours a day reading the Bible until
you're prepared to ask the Virgin for forgiveness.

I'll lose my voice!

GRACE goes downstairs towards the door.

Icouldn’t care less. Begin.

What do I do when I've finished?

Don't worry, it’ll be a long, long time before that happens.

ANNE
Yes, but when I do, what then?

GRACE glares daggers at her daughter as she opens the door.

GRACE
You can start again.

She slams the door behind her.

ANNE stands for a while in silence. Then she opens the Bible and starts reading.

ANNE
(in an exaggeratedly loud voice)

“Cain and Abel. And Adam knew Eve, his wife; and she
conceived, and bare Cain, and said: (even louder) ‘I have
gotten a man from the Lord’. And she again dare his
brother Abel. (A certain tearfulness begins to mingle with
her shouting). And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain
was a tiller of the ground.”

BERTHA

Yes, ma’am, she was. (She moves to the centre of the
room and wrings her hands in her apron as if she were
afraid of what she’s about to say). How much longer is
this punishment going to last? It’s almost a month now.

GRACE
That’s none of your business, Bertha...nor mine. It’s up
to her. She’s got to learn to swallow her pride and ask for
forgiveness.

BERTHA

Yes, ma’am.

GRACE

Anne, it’s gone rather quiet up there! (To BERTHA:) By
the way, I’ve had to put up with the noise of Lydia running
around over my head all moming. She’s been hurtling
backwards and forwards as if there were three of her up
there. Kindly tell her that, to do a bit of cleaning, it’s not
necessary to kick up such a rumpus. I don’t want to have

Word of God should never be left unfinished.

GRACE enters the room. We see thar BERTHA is no longer there.

She crosses the room diagonally, walking a little like an automaton, as if still affected
by the question her daughter had just asked her.

A noise above her head makes her look up to the ceiling. Rapid steps run up and down
from one side to the other. GRACE follows the path of the noise as if watching a fly.

There is a sudden silence.
Something falls to the floor with @ crash.

Nothing, as far as I know, mummy. I'm just reading, like

you told me.

GRACE climbs the stairs. ANNE resumes her reading.

Another creak is heard in the darkness.

Who’s there?

ANNE

I’ve seen them, I get into trouble, and if I say I haven’t, it’s
just as bad!

GRACE takes her daughter by the shoulders.

- GRACE
Anne. Tell me if there’s anyone upstairs and, if so, where.

- ANNE looks at her mother in silence. Then she points to behind her.

GRACE turns round: we see a door at the end of the passage. Daylight filters through
the cracks, outlining her silhouette in the darkness.

ANNE
There. They’re in there.

GRACE walks slowly to the door. Although she is @ courageous woman, she is
obviously very nervous.

She reaches the door, inserts a key in the lock, turns it and slowly opens...

She stands for a few seconds in the doorway, looking cautiously within, as if she dare
not enter.

ANNE
Mummmy...mummy...

GRACE looks at the girl.

ANNE
(hiding her face behind her hand)
You're letting the light in. Make up your mind...either go
in or shut the door.

GRACE swallows. She goes in and closes the door behind her.
49. THE HOUSE. THE ROOM OF THE NOISES. INT.DAY.
GRACE looks around her. The room has more furniture than the rest of the house put

together, as if it had been used as a storeroom.

36
 

There are so many nooks that‘it is difficult to form an idea of how much space there

really is, and much less so, to know if there is anyone lurking behind some hidden
corner.

GRACE moves forward and stands in the centre. Her look is distant, as if she were
paying more attention to what she can hear.

We slowly approach her ear...
Very vaguely, mingled with the noise of the leaves in the garden, we detect an amalgam
of confused whispers. It is almost impossible to distinguish what they are saying.

We hear a sort of supernatural moan followed by a deep breath. GRACE steps back,
tying to-locate the voices, but though they seem to be right beside her, she is unable to
pin them down.

OLD WOMAN’S VOICE
She’s here, she’s here...

VICTOR’S VOICE
Mummy, she says she’s here.

OLD WOMAN'S VOICE
She’s watching us. (The voice turns into a plaintive moan)
She’s watching us...she’s watching us!

MRS. MARLISH’S VOICE
Sshh...

GRACE opens wide her eyes, trying to see in greater detail what she has in front of her,
but she can only see a couple of pieces of furniture and a wall.

She sees that the door of the room is open, and what is more, that it is closing slowly.
The fact that there is only darkness on the other side makes it impossible to tell who is
pulling on the doorknod.
She runs towards the door and into the passage.
50. THE HOUSE. HALL — UPPER LANDING. INT.DAY.

ANNE
(pointing in various directions)
Over there, and over there...and over there, 2s well.

At the end of the passage, in the half-light, at least two doors seem to shut.

ANNE
They’re everywhere. They say the house is theirs.

GRACE runs quickly downstairs and stands in the middle of the hall, looking frenziedly
in all directions.

ANNE
And they said they’re-going to take down the curtains.

51. THE HOUSE. STUDY ROOM. INT/DAY.

BERTHA, holding NICHOLAS in her arms, watches GRACE. place a notebook in front ,
of ANNE, who is seated opposite an oil lamp.

GRACE
I want you to draw them, one by one, and tell me
everything you know.

ANNE stands up and walks towards a corner.

ANNE
Wait.
GRACE
Where are you going?
ANNE
(reassuringly)
Wait...
BERTHA

Ma’am, please calm down.

GRACE
[will not calm down! During five whole years of German
occupation I managed to avoid a single Nazi setting foot in
this house! And now there’s someone here, here under my
very nose, opening and closing doors!

BERTHA
Ma'am, this is an old house. Old houses have their quirks:
the floorboards creak, the plumbing clanks...You said so

or yourself...
   

ANNE returns to her mother’s side with her textbook, and tugs at her skirt.

ANNE
oN Look, mummy.

GRACE
They were voices, human voices! A boy and two women,
they were talking together.

ANNE
. Mummy, look. I did it the other day.

ANNE shows her the drawing from her colouring book The members of the family have
' undergone a considerable transformation thanks to Anne's infantile scribblings. The

girl has drawn long lank hair and a moustache on the father. The mother now has a
shock of black, curly hair on her head. The boy has hardly been altered. Neither has
the old lady, except that in her case, she has not drawn in her pupils, which gives her a
somewhat inhuman look (rather like that of a zombie). The girl is scribbled out.

Beside each drawing there is an arrow and an identifying label.

ANNE
This is the father, this is the mother, this is Victor and this
is his grandmother.
—“* GRACE

What do these numbers stand for?

ANNE

(as if stating the obvious)
That’s the number of times I’ve seen them. The girl
doesn’t exist, that’s why I’ve crossed her out. I saw the
father twice, in the hall; the mother as well - once in the
hall and once in the kitchen; Victor five times, all in

different places...and...her...I see her more and more
often. :

Next to the old woman is written the number 14.

GRACE
My God! Bertha, go and call Mr. Turtle and tell him we

have to search the whole house, right away, before it gets
dark.

BERTHA
ey (pucting the boy down)
, Yes, madam...

BERTHA leaves the room. ANNE points to the drawing of the grandmother.

ANNE
Look, mummy, she really scares me.

C) NICHOLAS hugs his mother.

NICHOLAS
(trembling)
Mumuny...

GRACE
It’s all right, darling, nothing’s going to happen to you
while mummy’s here.

-* ANNE

She's got really funny eyes, see? It’s as if she’s not
looking at you, but she can see you. And she’s always
around, saying: Coooome to wuuuuus...

GRACE
Anne, don’t lie to me!

ANNE
Honest, mummy. And she asks me things. Victor told me

iy she’s a witch.
GRACE
What does she ask you?

ANNE
Things. And her breath smells.

52. THE HOUSE. HALL. INT/DAY.

GRACE, holding a hunting rifle, is looking in a drawer for cartridges. The old man
TUTTLE and LYDIA are'standing behind her.

GRACE
We have to open all the curtains. I don’t want any dark
comers where sorneone could hide.

TUTILE
Yes, ma’am.

GRACE begins ta load the rifle.

 

GRACE
You both search the right side and I'll take the leit. Then
we'll search upstairs.

sn
 

 

The servants leave.

GRACE snaps the rifle shut. Then she looks at it strangely, cs if recalling some
distant...and unpleasant memory.

She shakes her head and leaves the room.

53. THE HOUSE. ROOMS. INTJDAY.

We see various shots of curtains being opened by TUTILE, LYDIA and GRACE.
Daylight floods into the different rooms.

54. THE HOUSE. FACADE. EXTJDAY.

Evening falls.

We zoom in on one of the windows of the house and discover GRACE, as the curtains
are suddenly flung open.

She looks behind her, holding the rifle with both hands. Then she takes a lamp and
moves towards the next door.

55. THE HOUSE. JUNK ROOM. INT/DAY.

GRACE enters another room. In spite of the prevailing darkness, it is clear that the
room is full of junk, some of it scattered over the floor.

GRACE moves cautiously forward. She places the lamp on a table and walks towards
one of the curtains... .

As she draws the curtain, the light illuminates a thin-faced figure dressed in old-
Fashioned clothes, who seems to observe her from a corner of the roam.

GRACE gives an involuntary shout, and points her rifle at him...
...until she realises that she is standing in front of a Pre-Raphaelite style portrait.
GRACE stands laoking at the painting for a while.

Then she inspects the room, in the brighter light of day. However, rather than looking
for signs of people, she seems to pay more attention to the objects that surround her.

Among the huge number of objects she finds several portraits, almost all of them
daguerreotypes and photographs.

56. THE HOUSE. CHILDREN’S BEDROOM. INT/DAY.

ANNE is plaving with a doll, on a corner of the bed. NICHOLAS is sitting on the floor,
looking bored.

 

 
 

 

 

BERTHA ts snoozing next to a table on which there is an oil lamp.

ANNE
Why do we have to stay in here?

BERTHA stretches.

BERTHA
Because your mother is opening all the curtains. She's
looking for the intruders.

NICHOLAS
What does “intruders” mean?
” BERTHA
“Inttuders” are people who go into someone’s house
without permission.

. NICHOLAS
‘Why have they come to our house?

BERTHA :
Pethaps they were planning to steal something. Or
perhaps they’re just looking for shelter.

ANNE
I know why they’ve come. They reckon the house belongs
to them and that we’re the intruders.

BERTHA
Where did you get that idea?

ANNE does not answer. She carries on playing with her doll.

NICHOLAS
(scared by his own words)
Perhaps they’re ghosts who lived in this house before and
who...and who...

ANNE
Don’t be stupid. I already told you that ghosts go about in
white sheets and go...*ooOOQOo00!”. And they walk
about clanking chains.

BERTHA
Anne, why do you make up such stories?

ANNE

I don't make them up. I read it in a book.

BERTHA
You shouldn't believe everything you read in books.

ANNE
That’s what my mother says...she says that when people
die, their souls go to Heaven, or Hell or Purgatory, and
that all this stuff about ghosts is rubbish. But then she
expects us to believe everything that’s written in the Bible.

BERTHA
Don’t you believe it?

ANNE
I believe some things... But, for example, I don’t believe
that God made the world in seven days...or that Noah got
all those animals into one boat. Or that the Holy Spiritis a
dove.

NICHOLAS
No, I don’t believe that either.

ANNE
Doves are anything but holy.

NICHOLAS
They crap on our windows.
* ANNE
.And I don't believe that Jesus cast out demons into 2
herd of pigs and made them jump into the sea and drown.
Poor pigs! It wasn’t their fault!

BERTHA smiles at the idea. Then she becomes serious.

BERTHA
Have you mentioned this to your mother?

The children are quick to shake their heads, as if the very thought of it scared them.

ANNE
Do you believe in ghosts, Bertha?

BERTHA, finding the question difficult, takes her time in answering.

BERTHA
(rather nervous)
Of course not.

57. THE HOUSE. JUNK ROOM. INT/DAY
OQ GRACE is lost in thought, her eyes glued to the portraits piled up in front of her.
After a few moments’ mental debate, she eventually takes out of her skirt pocket the
page from Anne's colouring book and places it beside the portraits, as she goes through

: them one by one, comparing them with her daughter's drawing.

From time to time she looks towards the door, as if she were ajraid to be caught red-
handed.

She opens a very dusty, black bound album. Faces from the previous century pass
before her gaze, with a solemnity characteristic of old-fashioned poses. They all have '
something in common: the subjects are all sitting or lying down, with their eyes closed.

BERTHA
(of .

)
Ma'am... .

GRACE stands up, quickly hiding her daughter's drawing in her pocket.

GRACE
Yes...?

The door opens and BERTHA appears.

6 BERTHA
They’ve searched everywhere. There’s no one downstairs.
GRACE
Good. Then tell them to go upstairs. I'll join them ina
minute.
BERTHA
(turning to leave)
Yes, ma'am.
GRACE
Bertha? .
BERTHA
(turning back)
Yes?
GRACE

 

Have you any idea what this might be?
GRACE goes up to the old women and shows her the album.
BERTHA |
(as if stating the obvious)
It’s a photograph album, madam.

C) GRACE
ad Yes, but everyone’s asleep, look.
BERTHA

They’re not asleep, madam... They’re dead.

GRACE looks at the old woman, with a mixture of surprise and terror.

a

BERTHA
It’s a book of the dead.

4 --

: GRACE

: (flipping through the pages with the tips of her fingers)
I've never seen anything like it.

BERTHA
It was common practice during the last century. They
photographed the dead in the hope that their souls would
live on in the portrait.

GRACE
oO There are even group portraits...And children! It’s
-macabre. How could those people be so superstitious? It
shouldn’t have been allowed.

BERTHA
Grief over the death of a loved one can lead people to do
the strangest things.

On the last page there are some faint tear marks in the form of an X, as if someone had
hastily ripped out a photo. GRACE gazes at the marks, absentmindedly, while she runs
her fingers over the torn paper.

GRACE
How odd, someone has ripped out the last photo.

BERTHA
Ma'am, hope you don’t think...

GRACE
I'm not suggesting it was you, Bertha.

 

: BERTHA
Perhaps someone took the photo years ago...

 
 

GRACE ~
No, the marks are recent.

BERTHA
Maybe...maybe it came unstuck.

GRACE

(not really convinced)
Yes, that must be it.

58. THE HOUSE. LOUNGE. INT/NIGHT.
Through the window we can see the trees in the garden waving in the wind. :

GRACE is curled up in an armchair, in front of the hearth, staring absently into the fire:
The rifle lies at her feet. mo

Behind her, sitting near the door, is BERTHA, reading the Bible.

GRACE
(without taking her eyes off the fire)
Bertha, why don’t you go to bed? It’s very late.

BERTHA
(looking up from the Bible)
You look 2s if you could do with 2 good night’s rest
yourself, ma’am.

For a moment, GRACE seems to betray the hint of a smile.

GRACE
T employed you to take care of my children, not me.

BERTHA
You must rest. You go and lie down, I'll keep watch.

GRACE
You don't know how to handle a rifle.

BERTHA
Ican learn.

GRACE smiles again. Then she turns to the old women.

GRACE
It’s cold. Come and sit by the fire.

BERTHA
Thank you, ma'am, but don't worry, I'm fine where I am.

BERTHA sits timidly in an armchair near GRACE and warms her hands in front of
fire.

GRACE

(with @ glimmer of tenderness)
Come on... :

BERTHA
Thank you very much, ma’am.

the

GRACE
Tell me about when you worked here before.

BERTHA
What do you want to-know?

GRACE
Did you have children to look after then as well?

BERTHA
No. No, the master and his wife didn’t have any family. I
was in charge of organising the housework.

GRACE
Were there many servants?

BERTHA
About fifteen. But in the end there were only the three of
us left.

GRACE
Why?

BERTHA
My employers moved to London. They came here less
and less, what with it being so out of the way and all...
And so the house was gradually left empty.

GRACE
It’s the same old story. Everyone ends up leaving this
damned island. My family went in the summer of 1940,
just before the invasion... And that was the last I ever
heard of them...

BERTHA
Oh.

GRACE
It makes no di nce, [don't blame them. All's fairin
love and war.

 
BERTHA
Actually, we lef, too. Although...well, (she looks around
her wistfully) sometimes you leave a place, and it’s as if

oN it’s there with you all the time. I always felt like I'd never
LC) left this house.
GRACE
Why did you leave?
Pause.
” BERTHA
It was...on account of the tuberculosis.
GRACE
(surprised)
Tuberculosis?
BERTHA ,

The whole area was evacuated.

GRACE
When was that?

“ BERTHA

In...a few years ago.
Pause. Burning logs crackle in the hearth.

GRACE
Was that when Lydia was left dumb?

From the old woman's expression it is clear that she does not like talking about this
subject.

|

BERTHA

Yes, I think so... (She smiles nervously). This poor old
memory of mine is a bit rusty these days.

 

GRACE
What happened to her?

BERTHA
Suddenly, one day, she just stopped talking.

 

GRACE
But there must have been a reason...

wn

| BERTHA shakes her head.

BERTHA
If there was, I never found out. .

But people don’t just stop talking like that, for no reason.
These things are always the result of some sort of
trauma...(To herself). Something must have happened to
) her... (Pause,) Were your employers good to you?

BERTHA
Oh, they were very pleasant indeed.

~ GRACE
You don’t have to lie, Bertha.

BERTHA
No, no, madam, I’m serious. They were always very kind
to us, and...well, we'll always be grateful to them for the
way they...
BERTHA cuts herself, short, as if she had said more than she should.

GRACE

O

The way they what?

BERTHA
The way...the way they treated us. Ma’am, if you'll
excuse me, I’d better go to bed, or there'll be no getting
me up in the morning.

GRACE
Off you go. I’ll stay here a while longer.

Z . »  BERTHA stands up and walks towards the door..

GRACE
Do you know what became of them, whether they’re still
alive or not...?

BERTHA
No, to be honest, I don’t. Goodnight, ma’am.

Goodnight, Bertha.

I'm peeing myself.
ANNE
Well, you'll have to wait till tomorrow.
NICHOLAS

ANNE

You know mother doesn’t let us leave the room.

NICHOLAS
But, I can’t hold it in any longer.

ANNE thinks fora moment. Then she makes a gesture of impatience and gets out of
bed.

ANNE
Face the wall.

NICHOLAS, as if he were already accustomed to this, turns round and faces the wall.
Behind him we see ANNE rummaging around in some part of the room.
NICHOLAS
Hurry up, I’m bursting.
ANNE approaches him and hands him two keys.

ANNE :
This one is for here, and this one for the bathroom.

NICHOLAS
No, I don’t want to go on my own.

Here we go!

The children stealthily open the door and leave the room.
60. THE HOUSE. PASSAGE WITH VIRGIN. INTJNIGHT.
The children step into the passage. Moonlight shines through the windows.

. They proceed on tiptoe.

Suddenly, NICHOLAS stops dead, staring towards the end of the passage.

ANNE
What is it?
: : NICHOLAS
a (in an almost imperceptible whisper)
There’s someone there.
ANNE
Where?
NICHOLAS
(gesturing with his head)
Look.

At the end of the. passage there is a'statue of the Virgin with a raised arm. Next to ita
human silhouette can be made out.

ANNE stands for a few moments scrutinising the darkness. Then her expression

 

relaxes,
ANNE
It’s the shadow of the Virgin, silly.
NICHOLAS
No, no.
ANNE

Nicholas, it’s the shadow of the Virgin.

NICHOLAS
Let's go back.

ANNE begins to walk to the end of the passage.

ANNE
Don’t be stupid.
NICHOLAS
Don’t go, don’t go.
ANNE

Cowardy custard.

NICHOLAS watches in horror as his sister stands next to the shadow.

ANNE
(looking ar NICHOLAS

See? It’s only a shad...

The shadow suddenly shoots out a black arm and grasps the girl.
ANNE screams. NICHOLAS steps back.

Moonlight shines on the silhouette. It is GRACE.

GRACE
(in an angry whisper)
Do you mind telling me what you’re doing? (She looks
toward the end of the passage) Nicholas, come here. -

The boy walks slowly towards his mother.

ANNE
I was only taking him to the bathroom, mummy. He said
he was’ bursting for a pes.

GRACE
How did you get out of the room?

ANNE
The door was open.

GRACE

That Bertha’s going to feel the sharp end of my ‘tongue
when I see her...And how were you thinking of getting
into the bathroom?

 

of ANNE
\ We were going to ask you for the key.

Pause. GRACE looks at NICHOLAS

GRACE
You should have gone before you went to bed. Come on,
then, be quick.

NICHOLAS

I don’t think I need to now.

61. THE HOUSE. BATHROOM. INT./NIGHT.

GRACE is vigorously washing NICHOLAS who is standing in the bath, holding up his

Pyjama jacket.
The boy watches his mother.
. NICHOLAS
Mummy.
GRACE
(still annoyed)
What?
NICHOLAS

When's daddy coming home?

The question upsets GRACE and she pauses momentarily. Then her expression hardens
and she continues scrubbing his legs.

GRACE
When the war’s over.
NICHOLAS
Why did he go to war...I mean, nobody's done anything

bad to us?

} Pause. GRACE's eves redden and tremble. It is obvious thar she does not like talking
asout the subject.
GRACE
Daddy went...(with slight sarcasm)...Daddy went because
he’s very brave. And he wasn’t prepared to let the
Germans tell him what he had to do.

NICHOLAS
Why?

GRACE shakes her head. She seems on the point of bursting into tears.
62. THE HOUSE. GRACE’S BEDROOM. INT/NIGHT.
GRACE, lying on the bed, bursts into tears.

*, GRACE

(groaning)
Why, why...?

She stretches out her hand and takes a handkerchief from the bedside table. She blows .
her nose, and tries to pull herself together. ,

A sudden noise changes her expression. She sits up and listens...
The piano is playing.

The gentle, mysterious melody, reminiscent of Satie, cannot be clearly distinguished as
it echoes through the house.

GRACE quickly puts her slippers on.

63. THE HOUSE. PASSAGE — STAIRS. INT/NIGHT.

GRACE rushes out into the passage, grasping the rifle and an oil lamp.

The melody can be heard more clearly.

She stops at the head of the stairs, as if having second thoughts about going down.
She descends the staircase slowly. The wooden stairs creak

GRACE looks around her nervously as she descends, although her attention is almost
totally directed towards the music room.

64. THE HOUSE. HALL - PASSAGE. INT/NIGHT.

GRACE stops in front of the music room door. She places the oil lemp on the floor in
ps inj

order to have better control of the rifle and slowly pushes on the door handle.

Almost instantaneously the music stops, vanishing in @ sort of melange of notes, as if
someone had suddenly stopped plaving but withoue releasing the sustain pedal.

64
   

GRACE pushes the door wide open and, with the rifle raised, peers around the room:
there is no one sitting at the piano, although the lid is raised.

GRACE takes a deep breath and enters the room.
65. THE HOUSE. MUSIC ROOM. INT/NIGHT.

GRACE walks slowly towards the piano...

Behind her, the door slowly closes (with the inevitable squeaking of hinges, needless to

Say) leaving the oil lamp outside. Now the only light is what filters in from the night
through the windows.

GRACE stops, uneasily, as if unsure whether to go back and open the door again or to
continue towards the piano...

She moves towards the piano.

She closes the lid and locks it.

She looks around, without lowering the rifle: there is no one in the room.
She returns to the door, opens it and leaves.

66. THE HOUSE. HALL - PASSAGE. INT/NIGHT.

GRACE bends down to pick up the oil lamp, beside the door. As she does so, the door
closes behind her, very, very slowly.

Pause. GRACE opens the door again...
She swings it gently backwards and forwards, as if checking the state of the hinges.

She leaves it open for some time, looking continuously to the back of the room.

Absolute silence...

The door slams in her face with unexpected violence. The movement is so brusque that
GRACE almost falls to the floor.

On the other side of the door, we hear someone turn the key firmly in the lock

GRACE turns and runs up the passage.

that someone else was there. A...presence...moving
around me. And it wasn’t human. Those

my children.

You musm’t say such things, ma’am. You should get
some rest...

I don’t want to rest! I can't. And I know I’m not mad.
(She-stands and walks around the table). My daughter’s
visions, the whispering voices, thé doors that open and
close, the piano... (Thoughfully:) That’s why that poor
girl went dumb. There’s something in this house that she
saw or heard...or felt!!, Something demonic.

O

BERTHA

Something which is not at rest...You don’t believe it, do

I don’t blame you. I had my doubts as well.
BERTHA

I do believe it, madam.

GRACE looks at her, slightly surprised.
 

. BERTHA

I've always believed in those things. They're not easy to
explain...but they happen. We've all heard stories of the
beyond, now and then... And I think that, sometimes, the

world of the dead...gets mixed up with the world of the
living.

GRACE
But that’s impossible! The Lord would never allow such
an aberration! The living and the dead will only mest at
the end of time. It says so in the Bible. .

BERTHA
There isn’t always an answer for everything, ma’am.

It’s time I went to the village and paid Father Lebrun a
visit. Lf hewon’t come here, I shall go to him. And PU
bring him back.

BERTHA
But, ma’am, you should wait for the weather to improve...

GRACE
I’ve waited long enough.

GRACE leaves the house. BERTHA follows her.
72. THE HOUSE. GARDEN. EXT./DAY.
GRACE rushes down the drive. BERTHA walks behind her.

BERTHA
The priest told me he would come as soon as he could...

GRACE stops and turns to face the old woman.

68
I'm tired of hearing what he tells you! I want him to tell
me, personally. He’s going to come today. The sanctity
of this house is at stake.

 

BERTHA
What are you going to tell him?

Pause.

GRACE
(pointing to the house)
I’ve searched every room in there, inch by inch. Now I
want them to be blessed.

GRACE walks off. BERTHA watches her anxiously.

73. THE HOUSE. GARDEN-TREES. EXTJ/DAY.

TUTILE, with a wheelbarrow beside him, is raking together three piles of dead leaves.

GRACE approaches him, through the trees.

BERTHA
(on
Ma'am, please, wait, it’s still very early!

TUTTLE
Good morning, ma’am.

: GRACE
Tuttle, I want you to search the whole garden and tell me
if you come across any gravestones.
TUTILE
Gravestones?

BERTHA catches up to them.

GRACE
When my husband bought this house three years ago, we
were told there was a little cemetery among the trees.

TUTTLE
I've not seen anythin:

Check carefully. The graves could be overgrown.

14. THE HOUSE. GARDEN GATE ~ROAD. EXTJDAY.

GRACE pushes open a huge wrought iron gate and comes out onto a dirt road that
disappears round both sides of the property.

A thin fog blurs the distant countryside.

75. THE HOUSE. GARDEN -TREES. EXT. DAY.

BERTHA and TUTILE look towards the exit.

Suddenly, the old woman's face, usually kind and almost naive, acquires a troubled, :
sombre expression.

BERTHA
(with complicity)
Now she’s convinced they’re ghosts.

TUTTLE
(leaning on his rake)
Don’t you think it’s risky to let her go?

BERTHA
(coldly)
Don’t worry. The fog won’t let her get very far.

, TUTTLE
Oh, yes, the fog: The fog...of course.

TUTILE resumes his work, raking the dead leaves. Suddenly he stops and leans on his
rake again.

TUTTLE
(pointing to the three piles)
And when...when do you think we should tell her
about...all this?

BERTHA
All in good time, Mr. Turtle. Allin good time. Oh, you'd

76. ROAD. EXTJDAY.

GRACE walks briskly along the roadside.

The fog has thickened.

Even though she is outdoors, not a single bird can be heard twittering.
The further GRACE walks on, the thicker the fog becomes.

The silence also becomes more and-ore enveloping; not a leaf rustles, nor is there the
slightest hint of a breeze...

_ There is a total stillness, which amplifies the sound of her Steps and her rapid

breathing.

GRACE looks behind her, rather uneasily: the fog is now so thick that she can hardly
See anything.

Only a grained, grey curtain stretches before her. It is now impossible to detect even
the branches of the trees.

GRACE stops, aware that she is losing her way.

Total silence.

She stretches her arm out into the fog. Her hand disappears into the mist.

GRACE's breathing becomes more and more panicky. Wherever she looks, she can see
only whiteness. Not a single shape is visible.

GRACE is overcome by panic. She turns to face the other way, - or so it seems, at least,
- with the intention of backrracking...

But she cannot escape the blanket of fog.
GRACE seems to be running literally through nothingness.

She stops once more to get her breath back”
In spite of herself, she is unable to stifle the occasional moan of desperation.

Suddenly, a warm ray of sunlight reaches her. In the distance, a figure is outlined
against the light.

The figure approaches slawly. GRACE feels so helpless and disconcerted that she can
only remain rooted to the spot.

When the figure is barely a metre away, GRACE lets out a groan of utter shock, and
puts her hands to her mouth.

The man, about thirty five years of age, is dressed in.military uniform. He carries a
knapsack on his back. He is tall and slim, with deep set eyes and c cadaverous jaw. He
has several scars and bruises on his face. His expression ts sad and absent, as ifhe had
lived through some terrible experience.

The man looks at her in silence without reacting, as if he did not recognise her. Then
his eyes widen a little. *

CHARLES

They embrace slowly. The knapsack falls to the ground.

GRACE begins to cry.

GRACE
(between sobs)
This can’t be true. It’s not possible. They told me you'd
been given up for dead...that you stepped on 2 mine and
were swallowed up by the earth.

CHARLES takes some time to answer.

CHARLES
(looking into space)
They...say a lot of things.

GRACE
(pressing herself even more closely to him)

Oh, thank you, God, thank you. Every night I’ve prayed
for this moment, asking for the impossible, begging God
to return my husband and the father of my children. (She
pulls away from him slightly and looks him in the eyes).
They don’t know anything. I told them the war wasn't
over yet, and that one day you'd come back. (She
embraces him again). And you have, you're back, you're
back... But...where have you been all this time?

CHARLES
Out there...looking for my house.

Why did you take so long?

shivering with cold. He stares fixedly at his father.

Hello, titch.

CHARLES stands by the edge of the bed. The boy bursts into tears.

ANNE
What acry baby! I told you he’d come back.

CHARLES puts the girl down, sits on the bed and embraces NICHOLAS. Only then
does the boy react and stretch his arms out to his father.

your.presence...your great mercy, which never fails to
succour mé-and my children, giving meaning to our lives.
Thank you for hearing my prayers, for showing me yet

GRACE resumes her embroidery, and the smile returns to her face.

GRACE
You know, I think just lately we’ve all let ourselves get
rather carried away. This house would drive anyone mad,
don’t you think so? It’s so big...and so dark. But, now
my husband's back, things are going to change. With him

Well...on whether they fought on the side of the “goodies”

fought for England, on the side of the “goodies”.

All right, that’s enough questions. Eat your food. You'll
never go to war.

The others surrendered.

GRACE

We all surrendered! There was nothing else we could do!
This is a small island and it was crawling with Germans,
damn it! Is that so hard to accept? (She slowly lies down,
resting her head on the pillow). What were you trying to
prove by going to the front? You were born here, for
God's sake! Do you remember...do you remember when
you told me...I know a house, in the middle of 2 meadow.
No one will bother our children there. And you brought us
to this cold, cheerless place, where I don’t even know who
I am, because no one knows I exist! And then you left
us... In this house we are all guilty of something.

Suddenly, GRACE feels CHARLES's lips on her neck. He gently embraces her.
They give each other a long look.

They kiss on the mouth and begin to undress. Against all expectations, GRACE shows a

When she has stretched and is fully conscious of what is happening, she lets out a
piercing scream, her eyes glued on the window.

113.THE HOUSE. CHILDREN’S BEDROOM. INTJDAY.

GRACE enters the room. The children are crouched behind one of the beds, trying to
protéct themselves from the daylight.

GRACE runs to the window, but instantly ‘realises that there are no curtains on the
curtain rail.

She picks up the two children, who are still screaming, and leaves the room.

114.THE HOUSE. PASSAGE. INT/DAY.

GRACE runs along the passage carrying her children. She puts them down in front of a
door and anxiously looks for her bunch of keys.

GRACE
Oh, my God,...oh, my God...!

118.THE HOUSE. CHILDREN’S BEDROOM. INTJDAY.

GRACE enters with the children and pulls a mattress off one of the beds. She drags it to
the window, to cover it.

ANNE and NICHOLAS cry incessantly.

After resting for a few seconds, GRACE runs to her children and examines their faces
’ GRACE
Don’t worry...it’s all right.

119.THE HOUSE. STUDY ROOM. INT/DAY.

LYDIA is quietly dusting the furniture.
GRACE enters and goes up to the young girl. She grabs her by the shoulders.

GRACE
Who was it?! Who was it?! Dammit!

LYDIA drops the feather duster in fright.

GRACE
You know what’s happening here...you know because it
happened to you, too! Tell me! Teil me!

LYDIA opens her mouth in an exaggerated way, uttering a wordless gargle, though we
do not know if it is out of fear or because she wants to say something.

GRACE drags her to a table where there is a noteped and a pen.

GRACE
Write it down. Come on. (She puts the pen in her hand).
Write!
BERTHA

That attitude won't solve anything, ma’am.

BERTHA is standing in the doorway, wearing a serious. solemn expression. GRACE

_ turns to face her.

GRACE
(with an angry look)
Oh, yes it will! It will if I can make her confess.

BERTHA
CY Even if, as you say, she did have something to
confess...she can’t write.

Pause. GRACE releases LYDIA who runs into a corner with a look of torment on her
face. She then approaches the old woman.

GRACE
Where are they?
+ BERTHA
What? .
GRACE

The curtains in this house! The curtains my children’s
lives depend on! Someone has taken them!

BERTRA
(coldly)
I’ve already noticed, you’ve no need to shout, madam...
Oh, Mr. Tuttle, I was just on the point of calling you.

e The old gardener appears in the doorway.

. BERTHA
Did you know someone’s taken all the curtains?

TUTTLE .
(with his usual absentmindedness)
The curtains? Oh, dear... Why should anyone...want to
take all the curtains?

BERTHA
(watching GRACE out of the carner of her eye)
To let the daylight in, I imagine.

» TUTTLE
(as if it were odvious)

Daylight...of course, daylight.

GRACE
Someone wants to kill my children!

BERTHA
But how do you know the light can kill them?

g3

 
Pause.

GRACE .
Have you gone mad, or are you just plain stupid? The
children are photosensitive! I already told you!

BERTHA
Yes, but that was before. It’s a disease that might have
cleared up spontaneously. How do you know they’re not
cured, if you never expose them to the light?

GRACE cannot believe her ears, but is lost for an answer.

TUTTLE
My sister-in-law used: to get terrible attacks of rheumatism
in her legs and back.... Then one fine day...(Long
pause)...they disappeared.

BERTHA
You see?

Silence. GRACE points a menacing finger at the three servants.
GRACE
(containing her anger)
T'm going to find those curtains, and when you’ve helped
me to hang them, you will leave this house.
GRACE walks to the door..BERTHA’s voice stops her.
BERTHA
What about the master? What has-he got to say about all
this?
GRACE goes upto the old lady, holding out the palm of her hand.

GRACE
Give me your keys.

BERTHA obeys instantly, though her attitude is icy.

NICHOLAS shakes his head timidly.
ANNE leaves her chair and goes to the mattress, which is blocking the window.
NICHOLAS

What are you doing?

ANNE pulls at the mattress, trying to make it fall.

NICHOLAS
No, no, no, please! I’m sorry, I'm sorry, 'm sorty...!

GRACE, holding the rifle and an oil lamp, opens the door of another room. It is very
small and completely empty.

123.THE HOUSE. UPPER STAIRCASE. INTJDAY.

GRACE is about to open yet anather door, when her attention is drawn by the last flight
of stairs, which is narrower than the rest.

She climbs it slowly until she reaches a small door...

She hunts through her bunch of, keys...
After a few seconds, she tuts in annoyance.

124.THE HOUSE. HALL -STAIRCASE. INT/NIGHT.°
GRACE, still carrying the rifle, runs down the stairs.

BERTHA is standing there, cuddling LYDIA, who still shows signs of having cried. The
two women and TUTILE, calmly waiting downstairs, appear to be expecting her.

& GRACE

The key.

N BERTHA
What key? :

GRACE stands facing the old woman.

GRACE
The key to the attic is missing.

BERTHA
Of course, madam. You told me and Lydia to use that

room, don’t you remember? And then you gave us 2 key
each...

GRACE
Exactly. And now I want them back.

BERTHA
But, what for?

GRACE breathes in.
GRACE
I’m not going to say it twice.

BERTHA does not seem to be intimidated. She moves away from LYDIA and Looks at
TUTTLE:

BERTHA
Mr. Tuttle, why don’t you tell the mistress what you
discovered this moring...?

The old man takes a few seconds to react, as if he did not know what she was talking
about. :

TUTTLE —
Oh, yes! Ma’am, do-you remember the graves you were
looking for? Well, I found them.

GRACE .-
I don't want to see any graves!

BERTHA
You ought to see them, madam. Then you’d see for
yourself...(the tone of her voice is more sinister than
ever)...that ghosts exist.

: GRACE
Ghosts do not exist!

. TUTTLE

(approaching GRACE)
Oh, yes, ma’am. I assure you ‘hey do...They exist all
right.

GRACE steps back For an instant, she seems intimidated by her servants.

: GRACE
I know what you want. You want to frighten us. You
want to get us out, me and my children. You want to take
over this house. Ever since the day you arrived...

The servants do not say a word.

GRACE
Now, give me the keys and we’ll see what it is you're

After several tense seconds, BERTHA hands GRACE her key and LYDIA's.

And now, get out of here.

The servants turn and leave the house. GRACE locks the door behind them. Then she
looks towards the top of the staircase...

She begins to climb slowly.

BERTHA, TUTILE and LYDIA are standing in front of the three gravestones.

BERTHA
(with a distant look, deliberate in her speech)
First she screams abuse at us, then she mistreats Lydia, she
takes our keys away and to top it all she kicks us out into
the bloody street. You know something, Mr. Tuttle...? I
think I’ve run out of patience...what about you?

TUTTLE
Oh, yes, of course.

Pause.

BERTHA

129.THE HOUSE. ATTIC. INT/NIGHT.

It is @ portrait of BERTHA, LYDIA and Mr. TUTILE. Their bodies have been

positioned carefully on a sofa, creating a strange triangular composition.

All three have their eyes closed.

Printed at the bottom of the photo, we read:

GRACE, still holding the rifle, goes downstairs.

GRACE goes out of the house and looks towards the garden.

In the moonlight, we see the children, running, terrified, towards their mother. Behind

them we can make out the three figures of the servants, walking slowly in a line, like
three cowboys in a gunfight. :

, GRACE
Run! Run! ~

The children reach their mother, who pushes them into the house.

GRACE aims her rifle at the three figures.

GRACE :
Don’t come any closer! One more step and PLL shoot!

The servanis keep walking.
GRACE does not hesitate a second longer and shoots.

The figures do not flinch.

Don’t trouble yourself, ma’am. Consumption finished us

NICHOLAS is verging on hysteria. ANNE makes a gesture of annoyance and decides to
stay with her brother.

Suddenly, the girl frowns, as if something were disturbing her. She looks intently at
NICHOLAS.

ANNE
Stop breathing like that.

The boy is unable to control his panting.

6 ANNE
Nicholas, stop breathing like that.

NICHOLAS becomes even more nervous and his breathing even heavier.

Stop breathing!

She holds her own breath, and looks towards the door.

Oh, God, help me. Help me...
Our Father, which art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name,

GRACE pushes the children back and grabs the sheets of paper, tearing them and
throwing them into the air, while the spiritualists shout in fear.

Suddenly we see the same shot, with the same framing, bur without GRACE and the

children, in such a way that the sheets of paper seem to be being torn and thrown in the
air of their own accord. ‘

‘

There follows a long silence. The OLD WOMAN seems ‘to come out of. ‘her trance.

One of the three men (Mr. MARLISH), with long hair and a moustache, exactly as

. ANNE had drawn him, approaches the old lady.

MR. MARLISH
Mother, are you all right?

OLD WOMAN
Yes, just a bit dizzy. What happened?

MR. MARLISH
They made contact.

OLD WOMAN
Allthree? -
ASSISTANT
Apparently, yes. The mother and the two children. Quite
interesting, don’t you think?

O

MRS. MARLISH
Interesting? I was scared stiff!

MR. MARLISH
Darling, calm down.

MRS. MARLISH
No. So far we’ve handled this matter your way. But now
you listen to me. We can’t stay in this house any longer.
It’s quite clear that these beings don’t want us to live here.

MR. MARLISH
We hardly know anything about them yet.

MRS. MARLISH :
Yes, we da. We know that the mother killed her two
children and then shot herself. That’s quite enough.

The group slowly disappears at the same time as GRACE and the children reappear,
hugging each other in a corner of the room.

MRS. MARLISE

Think of our son.
MR. MARLISH
(of)
Our son is perfectly all right.

MRS. MARLISH

He is not! He has nightmares, he says he has seen that
girl. And your mother has even been possessed by her.
Please, let’s get out of this house.

Thank God for that. I’m going to look in on Victor.

GRACE continues hugging her children.

A long silence.

GRACE

I tried to wake you up... But you didn’t move. I said to
myself: It’s happened... I’ve killed my own children. I
put the rifle to my forehead and pressed the tigger... But
nothing happened, and instead of the shot, I heard your
laughter in the bedroom. (With a bitter smile:) You were
playing with the pillows, as if nothing had happened. And
I thanked the Lord over and over again for being so
merciful with our lives, for giving us...another chance...
But now, now I don’t know what to think...(sobs). Now I
don’t know what to think!

BERTHA

The girl said the very same thing.

GRACE and the children turn towards BERTHA, standing at the end of the passage.

BERTHA .
Then she went dumb...forever. (Pause. Recovering her
servile tone:) Ma'am, shall I have breakfast prepared?

GRACE and BERTHA look at each other without rencour. GRACE nods.

BERTHA
The intruders are leaving, but others will come.
Sometimes we'll sense them and other times we won't.
That’s how it’s always been.

BERTHA moves away.

GRACE :
I don’t know any longer if there even is a Limbo... I'm no
wiser than you are now. But I do know that I love you.
