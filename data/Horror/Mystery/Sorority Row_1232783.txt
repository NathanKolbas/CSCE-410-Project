EXT. YALE UNI VERSI TY - DAY

The Harkness Tower looms over the gothic campus on this late
Oct ober day. It's getting chilly and the leaves are almost
gone. At the Branford Gate, a wrought iron lattice is etched
wth the motto, "For God, for Country, and for Yale".

INT. LECTURE HALL - DAY

The Mdtermexam_ The huge lecture hall is filled wth about
200 COLLEGE STUDENTS and a few TEACHING ASSI STANTS. The
T.A.'s are working their way up the center aisle passi ng out
the exams and blue books row by row. The smug HEAD T. A.
stands at the front of the room

HEAD T. A.
The midtermis worth forty percent
of your grade, but those of you
with a working know edge of the
Franco-Prussian War shouldn't be
too concerned.

In the aisle seat in the
VERY LAST ROW

DAVE GUTTENMACHER is flirting across the aisle wth a CUTE
G RL who seens to be enjoying Dave's attention. Then,
interrupting the magic, a SNOTTY T.A. arrives at his row and
hands Dave a stack of exams and blue books.

SNOTTY T. A.
Good | uck.

Dave gives hima fake smile and nod. He slowy takes a few
bl ue books and an examoff the stack and passes the rest to
the ANXI OUS WOMAN with granny glasses to his left.

Dave wites on the bottomright corner of his exam "What's

our number?" and passes it across the aisle. The Cute Grl

ooks up fromher exam then around to see if anyone is

wat chi ng. She grabs Dave's exam reads the note, smiles, and
writes back. Dave takes the exam back and reads her response
under his: "Alana, 6-0749".

Dave smiles, then casually takes a hard candy out of his
pants pocket, unwraps it, and puts it into his mouth. He
ooks around at the ridicul ous y frantic test-takers, shakes
his head in disbelief, and starts working.

Dave looks over the examthoroughl y. He flips through the
three pages, then flips back. A SIGH, then he starts writing
in his blue book.

Way down in the
FRONT ROW

sits ANGELA, beautiful, but a little intense. She is witing
into her blue book a menonic device: Pretty Boys Eat Fuzzy
Penne. As she writes, her tongue peeks out of the side of her
mouth.

HEAD T.A. (OS. )
This is a closed book exam Pl ease
keep your study materials under
your desk.

Di rectly behind her sits weasl y ETHAN. He stares at the back
of Angel a's head intensely. He |ooks around the roomto see
if anyone is watching him then "accidentally" knocks his pen
onto the floor in front of himself.

He looks around again, then | eans forward into Angela's hair.
He inhales deeply and takes great pleasure in the snell,
smling broadly to reveal his horribly crooked teeth. angel
TURNS AROUND suddenly and Ethan PULLS BACK and LOOKS AWY at
the last second.

ETHAN S POV

Amid the junble of test-takers, Ethan focuses in on Alana,
surreptitiously passing some papers across the aisle to Dave.

END POV

Ethan watches wistfully as Dave flirts wth Alana. He shakes
his head slightly in quiet resi gnati on.

BACK ROW
Dave looks at the exa

"What's your number
free this weekend?"

m The handwitten exchange now reads:
"Alana, 6-0749." "Dave. 6-1510. You
Maybe. Call me. [smiley face]."

    

Dave smiles then resumes casually filling his blue book. He
carefully studies the exam and continues witing at a speedy
pace. causing the Anxious Woman to make dagger eyes at him

"s witing: "(10) Explain the competing political |
philosophies of Bismarck and Metternich, their empirical
success, and their cultural significance." In fact, Dave has
filled the blue book wth the test questions, but no answers.
He closes the blue book and slips it into his jacket. He
opens a fresh blue book.

The Snotty T.A walks up the aisle monitoring the exam Dave
motions him over.

DAVE
(whi sper s)
I've got to use the rest room
SNOTTY T. A.
(whi sper s)
Can't it wait?

Dave looks at himincredulously. Then, a little too | oudly:

DAVE
I've got a case of explosive
diarrhea that's a time bonb
waiting to go off. Have you ever
danced wth the devil in the pale
moonl i ght ?

A few students | ook over at Dave. The Anxious Wan si dl es
away from him

SNOTTY T. A.
(whi sper s)
Leave your test here.

Dave |ooks down at the test (and Alana's phone number) for a
second, then up at the T.A. He leaves his new (and bl ank)
blue book on top of his examand walks out.

INT. HALLWAY OUTSI DE LECTURE HALL - DAY

and walks out of the building.

JEFF

The alien spits some sort of venomon one marine and he
SCREAMS bef ore exploding into a pool of blood. The door opens

on the table.

SAM

f you didn't take an AP. course
in high school, you have to pass
a written proficiency examthe
first week of school, or spend the
next two years taking foreign
language courses at eight a.m on
the other side of campus.

The test-takers are filling in their bubble sheets wth
number two pencils. Sam however, is just relaxing. Hs
answer sheet is blank, and he doodles a skull and cross bones
onto the test booklet, witten, incidentally, ENTIRELY IN
JAPANESE.

DAVE (cont'd; V.O)
So Sam whose only foreign
| anguage exper | ence is Pig Latin,
tells them he's fluent in Japanese
and sits for the exam

Sam looks around, then | ooks at his watch. The second hand is
appr oaehi ng the twelve, to bring the time to_an even 9:50. As
it ticks twelve, the FIRE ALARM sounds. The Proctor j umps up.

JAPANESE PROCTOR
(Japanese; subtitled)
Remain calm Leave your test

The students proceed out of the room but Sam|ags behind.
The Proctor sees Samstill in his seat and runs up to him
JAPANESE PROCTOR (cont' d)
(Japanese; subtitled

Did you not understand ny

instructions?! ? Leave your test

Sam just smiles at himand nods, but remains in his seat. The
Proctor is frantic.

JAPANESE PROCTOR (cont'd)
_. (Japanese; subtitled |

Is it your wish to be burned alive

in a horrible manner?

Sam clearly doesn't understand. He offers the Proctor a stick

of gum The Proctor yells into his face:

He bows, then runs out of the room Finally, Sampulls out a

nei ghbor's bubble sheet.

schemes take a hell of alot more
effort and brains than studying,
but Samlikes to figure things
out. To beat the system

UNFREEZE SAM

As he passes the copier over the sheet, a

He figured he'd ask Professor
Nathanson for an extension, but
when he gets there, he notices
something magical.

Just as he's about to knock, he sees a few papers sticking
out of a lucite bin attached to the door.
DAVE (cont'd; V.O

He shows himone of the papers wth text running almost edge

The space is for his comments.
JEFF
Look. | better redo this.

Jeff starts to walk away, then stops hi nmself.

INT. MALL - DAY

 

Dave (a little gunger) is walking through the mall with his
arm around a E GRL.

DAVE, (V. ©.)
| never knew j ust how good | was

"Seed of Doubt Principle."

Sudden! y. a different girl, MOLLIE, exits the Gap wth her
two FRIENDS. From about twenty feet away, Mllie sees Dave

DAVE
It wasn't me. | don't know who or

You know I'd never cheat on you.

She tries to shake off this incongruence, but it's too late:
the seed of doubt has taken hold.

She | ooks at Dave...

For a really long time...

But Dave shows absolute confidence...

Dave takes her hands in his, and looks straight into her

It wasn't me.

INT. SLACKERS' ROOM - DAY
STILL FROZEN on DAVE | aughi ng.

DAVE (V.Q.)

A lie repeated often enough
creates a seed of doubt in
people's minds. It helps if they
want to believe you, but either
way, people are afraid of

nore what's right in front of
t eir own eyes and accept sone
bizarre, warped reality than call

you a liar.

He saunters up to her and she enbraces himwith a passi onate
KISS. From out of nowhere, PORNO MUSIC begins playing. The

DAVE

Jeff slowy looks back at the girl and sniles.

SAM
It's like a trade secret. Tell you
what. Try this. Next time you're
spanking it, sit Indian Style.

DAVE
I'mnot gonna sit Indian Style.

The girl doesn't smile back. Instead, she takes her sandwich,
turns away, and walks out the door. Jeff's smile fades.

SAM

DAVE
Bend Your Knees...

ETHAN
So how s your | eg?

JEFF
It's fucking better, obvi ously.
Look, dude, we're straight. So if

And they walk back to the counter to pick up their order. The
gears starts turning in Ethan's head.

INT. STUDENT UNI ON - NI GHT

The guys are shooti ng, pool and eating their subs in the rec
room of the Student Union. Nearby, other STUDENTS are sitting
around studying and watching "Wheel of Fortune." Only a few

DAVE

"Wggle Roomwth a View’.

Some students |ook back at Dave, annoyed, but he goes ahead
and makes his shot. Then, Ethan enters the area, carrying his
bookbag (he rarely is seen wthout it).

JEFF
Dude. | told you, this is a no-

ETHAN
What's that supposed to mean?

SAM

Wait a second. What is it you

ETHAN
Hmm, let's see... You know, at

me: I've got Tomhere at an exam

I've got you taking the test after

SAM

ETHAN
(re: Dave)

He does.
24.

Dave is slightly agitated.

DAVE
Look. You can't prove any of this.
So why don't you just pat yourself
on the back, Sherlock, and go on
your way.

Ethan grins ear to ear.

ETHAN
Real | y?

And he pulls out of his bookbag the M DTERM EXAM on which
Dave and the Cute Grl (Alana) exchanged phone nunbers.

SAM
What the fuck is that?

ETHAN
This my friends is what we in the
bl ackrmail business call "the
smoking gun."

Sam looks at it, then turns to Dave who has turned a littl
red. Sam quickly |ooks around to see if anyone is watching
Ethan sees the desired reaction and returns the test to hi
bookbag. The guys put down their pool cues on the table.

SAM
OK. What do you want?

ETHAN
You know, that's a good questi on.
And one I've put a Tot of thought
into. Do | want money? | mean,

JEFF
No fucking way.

ETHAN
You're right. Too easy. That's why
I've come up wth a proposition.

JEFF

ETHAN
No. It's about a girl. Listen.
I've got a problemthat needs a

ETHAN
I'mtalking about you "delivering"

DAVE /

ETHAN

Very good. You catch on fast.

SAM
That's the fucking proposition?
Some chi ck?

JEFF
This isn't a dating service, dude.
Bag your own bitches.

Ethan turns bright red and LUNGES at Jeff.

ETHAN
Angela is not a bitch! She's a
very sweet girl! Not a dirty whore
like your mother!

The guys are startled by his sudden fury. Sore of the other
Students turn to see what's going on.

DAVE
Dude, relax.

SAM
Jesus, man. Chill out.

JEFF
Wow. Good one.

Ethan starts to regain his composure.

DAVE
Honestly, Ethan. What do you

He hangs up. He smiles smugly, then turns on a small desk

flowers, and candles. He takes a cell ophane bag out of the

Dave puts a reassuring hand on Ethan's shoul der.

DAVE
Look. Let's go wth plan B. Angela

Ethan walks briskly down the hallway. Qut of the corner of

patient's room He stops and walks over to it. He grabs the
paper cup full of jello, sucks it down in one disgusting
gulp, and continues on.

As he makes his way around the corner, he passes a sleepin

Angela rushes out of the room Ethan scranbles around
frantically.

ETHAN

What can | do?

VAN GRAAF
Sponge bath. Over there.

ETHAN

ETHAN
Ms. Van Gaaf!

VAN GRAAF
So very hot. Need spongin'.

ETHAN

Lower. Lower.

ETHAN
Unhhh!
VAN GRAAF
That's it. Right there.
Ethan is still averting his eyes, but as Ms. Van Gaaf

begins to purr, Ethan slomy turns to her. Slowy, his shock
and disgust subside, and his creepy smile begins to appear.
Ms. Van Gaaf opens her eyes and sees Ethan | ooking back at
her. She smiles. He smiles. A connection...

Ethan goes to sit on the edge of the bed, accidentally
sitting on the TV renvte. The TV snaps back on and the "Price

Just then, Angela bursts in wth the Nurse and a full COVPANY

ANGELA

More silence. Then, the waiter arrives wth their bottle of

Sam pours her cup full and they down it. Reanna cri nges.

REANNA (cont' d)
It's warm

SAM
But it's good, right?

REANNA
It's disgusting.

SAM
I'msorry. | guess it's sort of an
acquired taste.

Reanna |ooks at Sams dispirited face and fills up her cup
again. She downs the shot. She shudders. For the first tine,
Sam smiles.

REANNA
I'mtrying to acquire it.

She starts laughing, then Samjoins in.

the web and telling some Cultural

Reanna | aughs. She's having a great time. Samdigs in for

REANNA
No, I'mstarting to feel better.

He looks at her. She looks at him Sam!eans in and kisses

long passionate kiss. Suddenly, a GURGLE from Reanna stomach.
She pulls back for a moment.

SAM
Are you all right?

REANNA
Yeah.

He leans in to kiss her again. She smiles. A BURP. He pauses.
She smiles again, a little embarrassed.

He kisses her. Then, Reanna BLOWS CHUNKS. Sam pu
quickly, but the PRQECTILE VOMT splashes his f

FREEZE on SAM REANNA, and the MD-AIR VOMT.

DAVE (V.0.)

I've never had someone throw up in

mouth before, but I'm guessing
it's a romance killer. Kind of
reminds me of the time Jeff was
doing whi ppets all night long and
ut his dick in the Jiffy Pop
opcorn. Man that shit is hot. But
that's some good corn. And there's
nothing more trippy than watching
that foil expanding on the stove.

woul dn't even eat the popcorn.
W'd just put batch after batch on
our little hot plate, watching it

go.

Qh, right. So anyway...

UNFREEZE.

The vomit continues its voyage onto Samwith a | oud SQUI SH.
After the initial shock, Samlooks down on Reanna, doubl ed
over on the ground. Samcan't seemto find the right words
for a situation like this. After a beat,

Have you ever had a seri ous

Reanna.

DAVE
No shit. You went out wth Reanna?
That's great! Why didn't you say
somet hi ng?
72.

SAM
| don't _think |'mgoing to see her
again. The date didn't go too well.

DAVE

Dude, let me give you a little
advice. There's two kinds of
regret in this world, for things
you did but wish you hadn't done,
and for things you_wsh you'd had
the nerve to try. The second kind
of regret is far more painful.

SAM
OK. Lao Tzu. What's the relevance?

DAVE
You should see this girl again.
Gve it another shot. Remember the
motto of the Connecticut State
Lottery: "You can't wnif you
don't play".

SAM
| don't think so.

DAVE
Why not?

SAM
It's just not that important to me.

DAVE

DAVE
OK. Whatever.

An awkward sil ence.

DAVE (cont' d)
Is there something else you want
to talk about?

SAM
Yeah, | guess so.

DAVE
Wil...

SAM
| don't think you should keep
seeing Angel a.

DAVE
I'mnot "seeing" Angela.

Dave is a little embarrassed. He's avoiding eye contact.

DAVE (cont' d)
| mean, she's really sharp. | like
that. And she's got the greatest
Laugh. But going out wth Angela
would be too ... what'd you say?
Seri ous.

SAM
Good. Because if you start liking
this girl, then this Ethan planis
poi ng to seriously fuck things up.
"s going to turn us in.

DAVE
No he's not. It's under control.

Sam stops wal ki ng.

SAM
It's not under control. This guy
saw you in the classroom He saw
me after the test. And he's got
your name and phone nunber on the
goddam the test to prove it.

DAVE
I'm sorry.

SAM
Ethan can get us kicked out of
school at any time. He is a
serious threat. Maybe you don't
have anything to lose. But | do.
| need to graduate and | need to
get into law school. | can't
afford to stay in college forever,
Dave. And | don't want to either.

DAVE
So what do you want me to do?
SAM
| want you to stick to the fucking

Sam storms off in the other direction. Dave is puzzled by the
exchange.

INT. LIBRARY - DAY

Ami d the university stacks, Ethan and Dave talk in a study
carrel.

DAVE
| talked to her. She thinks you're
a fucki ng loon. She said you

ested some old lady.
ETHAN
That lady was a professional whore!
DAVE

Easy there, partner. Look. All's
I'msaying is you've got to doa
better job at this volunteer crap
if you want to get in wth her.
And try to be a little more

sensi tive.

Dave pulls a Snickers bar out of his pocket and starts to eat
it. Ethan stares at him

ETHAN
| know you guys think I'm sone
kind of nut case for trying to get
Angela to like me.

Dave puts down the Snickers bar.
DAVE

No, we think you're a nut job
because you re blackmailing us to

get Angela to like you.
ETHAN
Not ed.
DAVE
How do you even know if this girl
is right for you?
ETHAN
| just do.
DAVE

Let me ask you a question. Are you
just trying to sleep wth Angela,
or do you want to make her fall in
love wth you?

ETHAN
WIl, | really want her to fall in
love wth me, but I'd definitely
settle for sleeping wth her.

DAVE
Wl you know what? That's not
going to work. You have to choose.
75.

ETHAN
Fine. | want her to fall in love
wth re.

DAVE

So, you're ready to commit
yourself to this girl for the rest
of your life?

ETHAN
Sure.

DAVE
Remenber the bus scene in "The
G@ aduat e"?

ETHAN
Yeah, he's swnging the cross and
they get on the bus.

DAVE
Yeah, right. hey re sitting there
in the back of the bus all pumped
up and excited because they just
ran off together. So Nichols is
letting the filmrun out on the
camera or something and he tells
Dustin Hoffman and Catherine Ross
to cut. So they stop acting. They
just sit there. They’ re not
sm li ng any nore. TI ey. re just
tired T guess from acting all day.
Turns out, Nichols keeps it in the
film He loves their ironic
expressions like, "what the hell
did we just do?"

ETHAN
OK. So?

DAVE
So? So j ust make sure that when
this girl falls in love wth you,
you're not sitting on the bus
wondering "what the hell did |
just do?".

Ethan contenpl ates the suggestion.

DAVE
Who's Ching Ped?

ANGELA

Dave and Sam have returned. Jeff turns to them | ooking for

DAVE
Angel a's cool. She's not going to
rat you out.

Angel a | owers her voice.

ANGELA
No. No, of course not.

She's suddenly very interested in the conspiracy.
ANGELA (cont' d)
What's going on?

DAVE
He borrows other people's papers
and copies them

Angela takes a step back in surprise. Samis very
unconf ortable wth this revel ation.

ANGELA
You're kidding me. Doesn't the
professor see the simlarity?
80.

Jeff looks at Dave who subtly nods. Jeff acqui esces.

JEFF
Look, you think a T.A. would
notice if he read two identical
papers out of a hundred?

ANGELA
Yes.
JEFF
What are the odds?
ANGELA
| don't know. Ninety percent ?
JEFF

So you're admitting that _ten
percent of the time the T.A's not
gol ng to notice. And you also have
o factor in the possibility of
different T.A's reading the
papers, or maybe nobody reads the
papers at all and they just throw
em down the staircase to grade
‘em

ANGELA
OK.

JEFF
And now, what if you take four
different papers and cut and paste
paragraphs fromthemto make a new
ori gi nal paper? What are the odds

ANGELA
| don't know.
DAVE
Exactly.
ANGELA
When's it due?
JEFF
Half hour.

Angel a shows a little moral indignation.

ANGELA
So you guys are a bunch of
cheat ers?

DAVE
Let's just say rules were made to
be circunvent ed.

Dave chuckles to himself.

DAVE (cont' d)
Remenber the time you got an
extension on your term paper
because of Ramadan?

Sams still uneasy.
SAM
Yeah. | remenber.
DAVE
But the fasting wasn't really
worth it.
ANGELA
And you guys never go to class?
JEFF

| went to an African American
Studies class once.

Angel a walks over to the blinds and opens them She | ooks out
the window.

ANGELA
You don't go outside much, do you?

SAM
If outside's so great, why'd they
invent inside?

ANGELA
Expl ain something to me. If you
never go to class, how can you
possi bly do well ?

SAM
I've got a 3.8 GPA.

JEFF
Three seven five.

Angel a | ooks to Dave, but he shrugs.

DAVE
Don't look at me.

ANGELA
Isn't there something wrong about
all this?
82.

JEFF
You think five years from now your
boss at "Gobal Com Corp" is gonna

care whether you give him your
report or you give hima report?
Fuck no. All he cares about is
that the fucking report is right
so he can take his dam wife to
the Hamptons for the weekend to
get the bitch off his back.

SAM

oO.

DAVE
W're heading out to dinner

He holds out a twenty dollar bill and returns to his conic

INT. DINING HALL - NIGHT

Angel a and Dave are eating their dinners. Angelais still a
little shocked.

ANGELA
It's like a whole underground
culture.

DAVE
| guess you could say that.

ANGELA
| never knew those kind of people
existed. | mean, it never even
occurred to me to cheat. WIl,
actually, once, in junior high,
the teacher left the room during
a science test. | remenber Tomy
Mel deau took out a cheat sheet and
passed it to me. As soon as |
realized what it was | turned
bright red and passed it on.

DAVE
You're not exactly cut out for
that lifestyle. You have to have
a high level of confidence.
83.

ANGELA
I'm confi dent.
DAVE
| know. You are. | guess what I'm

sayi ng.is you have to |ook at the
way things are done in life and
say, “my way's better". Not many
peopl are willing to go out on
hat limb.

ANGELA
So you're a cheater too?

DAVE
No. WII, I'mnot going to lie to
you. I've skirted the rules once
or twice. It's hard not to wth
those two guys as your roonmates.

ANGELA
And you really want to stay in
college forever?

DAVE
Samis going to | aw school next
year and Jeff's interviewing to be
an investment banker. | know
what's waiting for me out there.
Wrking fourteen hour days and
bei ng too tired to go out when you
get hone.
(beat )
Dating. Bars. Complaining that
it's so hard to meet people.

ANGELA
It doesn't have to be like that.

DAVE

Maybe not. But at least | have the
foresight to enj oy college while
I'mstill init. Look at my life.
| wake up when | want to. hardly
even know what day of the week it
is. I've got friends everywhere,
fun around the corner, and all in
an intellectual environment. Fun,
smart people as far as the eye can
see.

ANGELA
hey if you think sitting around
all day dri nki ng beer is paradise,
then maybe we should just agree to
di sagree.
84.

DAVE
That's not it. It's not about
drinking or partying. It's about
being surrounded by your fri ends.
It's about camaraderie.

ANGELA
But what about | earning and |
committing to something and seeing
it through to the end?

No answer.

ANGELA (cont' d)
Don't you ever want to accomplish
anyt hi ng?

Dave puts down his fork.

DAVE
Yes. | do. Some day.

ANGELA
Good. | don't knowif | could ever
fall for a slacker.

She bl ushes slight! y as she | ooks into Dave's eyes. Dave is
entranced. He can't take his eyes off of her. After a monent,
he breaks free.

DAVE
Listen, Angela. About the other

ANGELA
Wii ch _ ni ght ?
DAVE
When you kissed me.
ANGELA

Yeah? What about it?
Dave is torn. He hesitates. Finally,

Huh?
PROFESSOR SCHM DTZ

Another seminar, another group of STUDENTS. PROFESSOR TAFT

STUDENT #2
But Cyrano wouldn't fight for the
woman he loved. That's why it's a
tragedy.

PROFESSOR TAFT
Good. But what was Cyrano's tragic

fl aw?
STUDENT #3

He was afraid. He was a coward.
DAVE

What the hell was he supposed to
do? Risk everything for a woman?
And there's no guarantee that when
they ride off into the sunset
there's not a big fucking cliff on
the other side.

Shocked, everyone stares at Dave.

PROFESSOR TAFT
Nice to see you in class, Dave.
But | think what Rostand was
saying is that the potential
reward was worth the risk and only
by recogni zing that fact could
Cyrano truly become the man he
al ways wanted to be.

These words strike a chord wth Dave. He reels back as the
discussion continues. He just sits there, thinking it over,
then he springs to life. Professor Taft watches silently as
Dave picks up his bookbag and exits.

no gunball.

He controls himself. He begins to walk away. He's cal m now.

Dave LOSES IT. He runs back to the gunmball machine wth a

SPILLING GUMBALLS al! over the floor. Full acified, Dave
reaches down and picks up a gumball. He ca y wipes it off
