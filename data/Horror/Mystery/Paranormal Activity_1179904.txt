EXT. DAIRY FARM -- DAY

A small, one-man operation. There’s a house, a few
outbuildings, corrals and a barn.

TITLE: VENTURA COUNTY 45 MILES FROM LOS ANGELES

 

Angle on JIM CROWLEY, a hard-working dairy farmer, 50's,
dressed in coveralls. He’s opening a gate. DAIRY COWS come
plodding through and head straight towards the milking barn.
They know the routine.

JIM
Morning, Girls. Let’s move along
now, sun’s been up for an hour.

Jim moves off and doesn’t see the last cow. Her name is
DELILA and she looks like all the rest, except she’s walking
backwards.

INT. MILKING BARN -- SAME DAY

Jim making his rounds, moving past the cows in their stalls,
a quaint wooden sign over each: SWEET SUE, OL’ BESS, MAGGIE
MAY, etc. The cows are facing away from us, udders attached
by clear plastic hoses to a complicated milking apparatus. We
can hear the automated pumps shushing rhythmically, see the
milk coursing through the hoses.

Jim reaches Delila. She’s completely still, her milk
stuttering through the hose.

JIM
You okay, Delila?

Suddenly, Delila turns her head, looks at him, a malevolent
glint in her eyes. She GROWLS.

EXT. DAIRY FARM -- MOMENTS LATER
Jim’s wife, ELLEN, hanging clothes on a clothesline. She
hears Jim yelling, then sees him stumbling out of the barn,

scared cows running past him.

ELLEN
Oh my heavens!

EXT. MILKING BARN -- THAT NIGHT
Jim and Ellen have the door open a bit and they’re peeking

in. We hear Delila’s rabid BELLOWING intermixed with
CRASHING and CLANGING. Apparently, she’s wrecking the place.
JIM
Well it’s not anthrax or hoof and
mouth. I’ve never seen anything
like this in 35 years of dairy
farming.

Ellen wants to say something, is too afraid.

JIM
What?
ELLEN
This is not natural, Jim.
JIM
Not natural? What’s that supposed
to mean?
ELLEN

Look at her eyes.

Angle on Delila, panting, glaring at them, eyes like molten
orbs, a burgeoning, unnatural fury inside her.

ELLEN
I’ve only seen that look one other
time. Remember my cousin, Thalia?
JIM
Aww Ellen --
ELLEN

Thalia was possessed, Jim. A demon
took hold of that poor woman’s body
and drove her right out of her
mind!

JIM
Cow’s don’t get possessed, Ellen.
They’re cows.

They hear a BELLOW that’s more like a scream. Delila is
galloping right at them, her face distorted into a snarl,
ears back, teeth bared like a dog. In a panic, they slam the
door shut as Delila rams into it, splintering the wood. Jim
looks at Ellen, realizes she may be right.

JIM
My God...

END COLD OPEN
ACT_1
INT. CAMRY -- DAY

JOSH KEELING at the wheel, drinking a chocolate milk with a
straw. He’s mid-30'’s, casually dressed, attractive, a regular
guy. Music begins, the Talking Heads sing the arrestingly
weird, “Once In A Lifetime” over...

A MONTAGE

Josh drives through a typical LA suburb, intercut with scenes
of ordinary people doing ordinary things; walking their dogs,
playing tennis, having coffee at Starbucks, talking on their
cells. The scenes are so ordinary they’re almost surreal.

JOSH (V.0.)
Somebody once said, the only normal
people are the ones you don’t know
very well, and how many people do
you know that well? I mean really.
Your family, your friends, the
people you see everyday? Oh sure,
they look normal, but believe me
when I tell you, normal can
disguise the weirdest stuff you can
imagine.

The montage ends.
EXT. PCI -- SAME DAY

A small, nondescript commercial building, “Paranormal
Consultants Inc” stenciled discreetly on the door.

COLLIN (V.0O.)
I believe all paranormal mysteries
have a scientific explanation...

INT. PCI -- CONTINUOUS

A combination office/lab. COLLIN CLARK in the lab area.
20's, white, geeky, chip on his shoulder. He’s repairing a
homemade device called THE M-PAC. It looks like a cross
between an assault pistol and an ionic blow dryer.

COLLIN
».-and technology will be the key
to unlocking them.

Angle on ATHENA ORTIZ; Latina, 20’s, street edge, hot but not
on purpose. She’s at the reception desk reading a book.

ATHENA
Some things will always be
mysteries, Collin.

(MORE )
ATHENA (cont'd)
The most you can do is harness
their energy and use them for good.

COLLIN
(scoffs) Is that like the Witch’s
Hippocratic Oath?

ATHENA
I’m a bruja.

COLLIN
My mistake. A bruja.

ATHENA
Runs in the family. My
grandmother’s a bruja too. In the
barrio she’s famous.

COLLIN
Oh really?

ATHENA
Yes, really. I’ve seen her do
amazing things and she doesn’t need
any technology made from stuff you
can get at Radio Shack.

Stung, Collin starts to retort but Josh enters with a BAG OF
DONUTS.

JOSH
Good morning.

ATHENA
Morning, Josh.

JOSH
(off the bag) Apple fritter?

ATHENA
Maybe some other time, like when
I’m skinny and have a dental plan.
(then) Messages. A Mr. Markett
called. He thinks his wife was a
victim of spontaneous combustion
and he’d like you to investigate
and The New Age Society wants you
to submit a paper on The Taos Hum
Phenomenon.

JOSH
Screen Mr. Markett, see if he
really had a wife and I don’t have
time to submit a paper.
ATHENA
We also have that consultation with
Jim Crowley, the dairy farmer? We
should leave soon.

Josh crosses to Collin.

JOSH
Apple fritter?

COLLIN
The new girl is not working out.

JOSH
I think she’s doing great.

COLLIN
She claims to be a witch, a bruja
no less.

JOSH

I know, Collin, and could we keep
an open mind?

New angle. The phone RINGS, Athena answers.

ATHENA
PCI. (then) Josh, it’s Barbara.

JOSH
I’ll take it in my office.

INT. JOSH’S OFFICE/PCI -- SAME

A cramped jumble of files, tapes, books, maps and photos,
Josh picking up the phone.

JOSH
Hello?

BARBARA (V.O.)
Colonial, God, that’s so
eighties..is that olive? No, it’s
more like a moss...

JOSH
Honey? What are we talking about?

INTERCUT
INT. KITCHEN/JOSH’S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

BARBARA, Josh's wife; 30'S, attractive, suburban prim. She’s
looking out of the window, watching the house next door. A
delivery truck is in the driveway, workmen toting a new
living room set (the subject of her comments) into the house.
TED STROUD and his wife, LASANDRA, supervising. They’re

attractive, black, 30's.

BARBARA
Ted and LaSandra, our new
neighbors? I invited them over for
lunch tomorrow. They seem nice
enough.

Barbara waves at the Strouds, they wave back. As the

dialogue continues Barb takes dishes out of the dishwasher

and wipes off spots only she can see.

JOSH
Is that why you called?

BARBARA
I just got off the phone with the
Vice Principal. Danni skipped
school.

JOSH
She did?

BARBARA
It’s the new boyfriend. Cal. He’s
taking advantage of her.

Athena appears in Josh’s doorway, gestures, let’s go.

JOSH
I’ve got to go. We’ll talk about it
later.

They hang up but we stay with Barbara _in the kitchen.
enters. 7 years old, a smart kid trying to figure out
world works.

ADAM
I finished cleaning my room, Mom.

BARBARA
Really? Why don’t we have a look?

INT. ADAM'S ROOM/JOSH’S HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER

The room is very clean but Barbara is inspecting with
scrutiny of a Marine sergeant, Adam watching, tense.

BARBARA
Good job, Adam. (then) Don’t you
just feel better when everything is
the way it’s supposed to be?

ADAM
Sure. I guess.

ADAM
how the

the
Barbara notices the bookshelf.

BARBARA
Adam, didn’t we say you would
alphabetize your books?

ADAM
I don’t think so.

A MINUTE LATER

Barbara and Adam examining a 20 PAGE, HANDWRITTEN CONTRACT
titled “MY CONTRACT WITH MOM BY ADAM KEELING”.

BARBARA
Here, Section B, item 7a. (reads)
“I will put my books away in
alphabetical order.”

ADAM
But they look neat and everything.

BARBARA
You agreed to the contract, Adam.
See? There’s your signature.

ADAM
But you said I had to sign it or I
wouldn’t get my allowance.

BARBARA
Give and take, sweetheart. We
negotiated.
On Adam, confused.
INT. CAMRY -- SAME DAY

Rural road. Josh driving, Athena riding shotgun. Through the
rear window, we can see Collin following them in a PANEL VAN.

JOSH (V.0.)

I’m not sure if Athena’s a bruja or
not but I liked what she said in
her interview.

INT. (FLASHBACK) JOSH'S OFFICE/PCI -- DAY
Athena interviewing with Josh.
ATHENA

My whole life I knew I was special
but I didn’t know how or why.
EXT. (FLASHBACK) STREET -- NIGHT

The barrio. Athena hanging with her rowdy HOME GIRLS,
drinking and laughing.

ATHENA (V.O.)
And I was cool with that. Lots of
people are ordinary, right?

INT. (FLASHBACK) LIVING ROOM/GRANDMOTHER’S HOUSE -- DAY

Athena’s GRANDMOTHER, gripping Athena by the shoulders,
imploring her, impassioned, her eyes ablaze.

ATHENA (V.O.)
But one day my grandmother called
me over to her house and told me
that I was a bruja like her and
that if I didn’t nurture my gift I
would lose it.

INT. (FLASHBACK) JOSH'S OFFICE -- DAY
Josh and Athena, the interview continuing.

ATHENA
She said other people could waste
their time but I didn’t have the
right. (beat) I had a calling.

RESUME SCENE
Josh and Athena still driving.

ATHENA
I’m surprised this dairy farmer
didn’t just put the cow down.

JOSH
He could have, but what if the rest
of his herd had the same problem?

ATHENA
So he calls a paranormal consultant
before he calls a vet?

JOSH
A vet might report the cow’s
symptoms to the Department of
Agriculture. They could quarantine
his farm.

ATHENA
Rock and a hard place.
JOSH
Like a lot of our clients. They
have a problem they can’t go public
with so they go online, look for
help. Eventually they find us.

ATHENA
Speaking of somebody who needs
help, what’s up with Collin?

INT. PCI VAN -- CONTINUOUS
Collin driving, brooding.

JOSH (V.0.)
Collin was a grad student in
physics, top of his class.

INT. (FLASHBACK) DORM ROOM -- NIGHT

A manic Collin working at his laptop, surrounded by stacks of
textbooks, complicated charts and diagrams.

JOSH (V.O.)

He wrote his thesis on a variation
of the big bang theory that
included a race of cybernetic
aliens.

INT. (FLASHBACK) OFFICE/UNIVERSITY -- DAY

Collin yelling at his PROFESSOR, then ripping a page out of
his THESIS and eating it.

JOSH (V.0.)

When his professor demanded
revisions, Collin refused, saying
he’d eat his thesis before he
changed a word of it.

RESUME SCENE
JOSH
He was booted out of school,
humiliating for a guy like him.
(beat) He’s got something to prove.

Up ahead, they can see the dairy farm. Jim and Ellen waving.

JOSH
I think we're here.

EXT. DAIRY FARM -- MINUTES LATER

Josh, Athena and Collin meeting Jim and Ellen.
10.

JIM
Mr. Keeling? I’m Jim Crowley and
this is my wife, Ellen.

JOSH
Please call me Josh. These are my
associates, Athena Ortiz and Collin
Clark.
Everybody shakes hands. We hear Delila BELLOW.

JIM
That’s Delila.

JOSH
We need to take a look at her.

Ellen notices Collin adjusting the M-PAC.

ELLEN
You’re not going to kill her, are
you?

COLLIN

Oh no, ma’am. This is an M-PAC
device. Multi-Purpose Attack and
Control. It’s charged with a non-
lethal pulse of super-compressed
argon gas.

JOSH
Actually, I thought we’d let Athena
take the lead.
Collin is put-out. Athena reacts, who me?
INT. MILKING BARN -- SAME DAY
The barn is a mess and full of shadows. Josh and Athena

enter. They can hear Delila’s HEAVY BREATHING coming from
somewhere in the darkness. Warily, they creep forward.

ATHENA
Josh, I have a confession to make.
JOSH
Now?
ATHENA
I’m a little worried about the
bruja thing. I mean I’ve watched

my Grandmother a lot but I’ve never
actually done stuff on my own.

We hear a threatening HUFF. Delila steps into view. Her
condition has worsened, she looks truly berserk.
11.

JOSH
I think you better get started.

ATHENA
I’ll try an incantation from El
Salmo de Los Muertos. It's

supposed to have a calming effect
on animals.

Athena holds her hands out, palms up, intones in Spanish:
ATHENA
Este en la paz apacible tranquilo,
ningin dafio vendra a usted, esté
en la paz con mi y curaré su dolor.
Deje la energia de mi terraplén del
coraz6n usted con amor y deje el--
Suddenly, Delila lets out a roaring BELLOW.

ATHENA
I don’t think this is working.

Delila paws the ground and charges.

ATHENA
Josh?

Josh seems unconcerned, Delila building speed.

ATHENA
Josh?!

JOSH
Anytime, Collin.

Collin appears with the M-PAC and fires. An INVISIBLE PULSE
warps the air, hits Delila and stops her cold. She staggers.

Angle on Josh, Athena and Collin as we hear Delila SLUMP to
the ground. Collin looks at Athena, smug.

COLLIN
Radio Shack. There is no
substitute.
A LITTLE LATER

Josh examining the unconscious Delila, Athena taking pictures
with a digital camera, Jim and Ellen watching.

JOSH
She’s got no obvious contusions or
lacerations, no blood anywhere.

Josh uses a mini-lite to check Delila’s eyes.
12.

JIM
If you don’t mind my asking, how
does a fella get into a field like
this?

JOSH
Started early. I was that kid.
(off Delila) Her pupils are dilated
but she’s not aphasic.

JIM
That kid?

INT. (FLASHBACK) YOUNG JOSH’S ROOM/APARTMENT -- EVENING

A chemistry set, models of spaceships hanging on wires,
terrariums full of lizards and spiders, a poster of Stephen
King looming over everything. YOUNG JOSH, 10 years old,
reading a comic book with great concentration, stacks of them
nearby, a PET SNAKE slithering up his arm.

JOSH (V.0.)
You know, the loner, the oddball,
the one everybody called “weirdo”?

RESUME SCENE
Josh checks Delila’s nose and ears.

JOSH
I was a curious kid too, almost to
the point of stupidity. (off
Delila) Ears are clean, no
discharge or ectoplastic residue.

EXT. (FLASHBACK) COAL MINE -- DUSK

Young Josh crawling out of an old coal mine, blackened with
soot, sputtering, BATS flying past him.

JOSH (V.0.)
If somebody said Big Foot was
living in the old abandoned mine?
I'd crawl in there and take a look.

RESUME SCENE
Josh puts a THERMOMETER in Delila’s mouth.

JOSH
When I was ten years old I even
camped out in the cemetery on
Halloween night. I wanted to see a
ghost.

JIM
How did your folks feel about that?
13.

INT. YOUNG JOSH'S ROOM/APARTMENT -- SAME EVENING
Josh still reading his comic book.

JOSH (V.0.)
My Mom raised me by herself and she
worked nights.

Josh's mom, RACHEL enters. Attractive and warm, early
thirties, nurses uniform. She’s putting on her coat.

RACHEL
Are you sure you don’t want to go
trick or treating?

YOUNG JOSH
I’m sure.

RESUME SCENE
JOSH
She never knew and I never told
her.

Josh checks Delila’s thermometer.

JOSH
Low grade fever, her tongue is
discolored too. I’1ll need a blood
sample.

JIM

And did you? See a ghost?

COLLIN (0.8)
Josh, over here!

JOSH (V.0.)
I saw a lot of things that night

MOMENTS LATER

Everyone gathered around Collin, kneeling in the wreckage of
Delila’s stall, a MOUND OF MANURE in front of him. He shines
a UV light on the manure illuminating HUNDREDS OF TINY WORMS.

COLLIN
Worms.

JIM
Cows get worms all the time and
they don’t act like Delila.

COLLIN
I found these in Delila’s stall and
nowhere else.
14.

JOSH
I want them collected, Collin.
Every single one.

Delila stirs, groans.

JOSH
She’s going to wake up pretty soon.
Can we put her someplace secure?

JIM
I’ve got a breeding corral. We
could roll her on to a tarp, drag
her in there with the tractor.

EXT. MILKING BARN -- SAME DAY
The group comes out.

JIM
Do you think she’s possessed?

JOSH
She’s showing some of the signs;
anomalous aggression, preternatural
strength -- but the worms, I’m not
sure how they fit in. (then) You’ve
got to stop selling milk.

JIM
Okay, but I can’t do it forever.
I’ve got a small operation here.

JOSH
We'll work as fast as we can and
I’ll call you as soon as we know
something.

Jim and Ellen move off.

COLLIN
I’ll do a blood panel and full work-
up on the worms.

ATHENA
How come Delila is the only one
that got them?

JOSH
Gut feeling? She was deliberately
infected. (to Collin) Make up a
separate worm sample for me. I’ll
get started at home, see if I can
identify them.
15.

ATHENA
You sure you want to take those
things into your house?

COLLIN
(patronizing) Worms are cold-
blooded. On ice they’ll be inert.

INT. CAMRY -- THAT EVENING
Josh driving, A LITTLE RED COOLER on the seat beside him.

JOSH (V.0.)
Spending Halloween night at the
cemetery was one of those things,
it seemed like a good idea at the
time.

INT. (FLASHBACK) LIVING ROOM/APARTMENT -- NIGHT
Young Josh seeing Rachel to the door.

RACHEL
You can still change your mind.
Mrs. Webberly will take you trick
or treating with her kids.

YOUNG JOSH
No thanks. I’1ll be okay.

RESUME SCENE

JOSH (V.0.)
I'll always wonder how my life
would have been different if I'd
gone trick or treating with Mrs.
Webberly.

Josh arrives at his house, turns in the driveway.
INT. LIVING ROOM/STROUDS HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

Angle on a SHOULDER HOLSTER WITH A GUN IT, hanging over a
chair, an LAPD DETECTIVE’S GOLD SHIELD CLIPPED TO THE
HOLSTER.

TED (0.S.)
I had a conversation with Bob
Fletcher, insurance guy, lives
three houses down?

New angle: LaSandra moving her new sofa. Ted at the window,
watching Josh get out of the car.
16.

TED
He told me Josh calls himself a
paranormal consultant. Whatever
that is.

LASANDRA
Really? His wife told me he was a
scientist. (beat) Are you going to
help me move this sofa?

TED
(helping her) I worked a long time
so I could afford this house, so I
could get away from noise and
pollution and the traffic and most
of all? The nutcases.

LASANDRA
Ted --

TED
So here I am, in my dream house,
mortgaged to the hilt and who is my
next door neighbor? A nutcase!

LASANDRA
You don’t know that, Ted. You don’t
know that at all. Now we’re going
over there for lunch tomorrow and
you're going to behave yourself,
you understand?

INT. KITCHEN/JOSH’S HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER
Josh crosses, puts the red cooler in the fridge.

JOSH (V.0.)
You'd think it would be a problem,
coming home after a day at work,
making the transition from the
strange and supernatural to the
mundane routines of normal life.

Adam appears.

ADAM
Mom and I have a disagreement over
certain implied terms and
exclusionary clauses. You may be
asked to mediate.

JOSH (V.O)
Actually, I have trouble telling
the difference.
INT. DINING ROOM/JOSH'S HOUSE -- SAME NIGHT
Josh, Barbara and Adam having dinner.

BARBARA
We have a clean slate with Ted and
LaSandra and I'd like to keep it
that way. As far as they’re
concerned we’re a perfectly normal
family.

JOSH
You mean we’re not?

BARBARA
Nobody else in the neighborhood
seems to think so.

JOSH
If you'd just let me talk about my
work it wouldn’t be such a big
mystery.

BARBARA
There’s only so much people can
accept, Josh. It’s one thing to say
you believe in UFO’s, it’s another
thing to say you’ve been on one.

DANNI enters. 16 years old, slovenly, not quite cute,

poster child for low self-esteem.

JOSH
Hey, kiddo.

DANNI
Hey.

Danni sits down, starts eating. Barbara shoots a look
Josh, then:

JOSH
You skipped school, Danni?

DANNI
Everybody skips school, Dad. It’s
like, what you do?

ADAM
Didn’t your contract stipulate
penalties?

DANNI
Don’t tell me you signed that
stupid thing.

They hear

18.

BARBARA
(to Josh) Cal made her skip school.

DANNI
Cal didn’t make me do anything.

ADAM
(to Danni) Mom said I had to sign
it or I wouldn’t get my allowance.

BARBARA
We negotiated, sweetheart. It was
give and take.

JOSH
So why’d you skip, Danni?

DANNI
Cal’s band was rehearsing and he
needed me to like, do stuff.

BARBARA
He treats you like a maid servant.

DANNI
He does not!

BARBARA
(to Josh) She cleans his house,
which by the way, is down by the
landfill.

DANNI
Okay, Mom, we get it. You hate my
boyfriend, just like you hate
everything else about me.

BARBARA
(hurt) Danni!

a car ROAR up to the house, the horn HONK.

DANNI
That’s Cal. I have to go.

JOSH
I think I need to talk to him.

Danni groans.

EXT. JOSH'S HOUSE -- SAME

Josh and Danni come out of the house, cross to the driveway.
19.

DANNI
(whispers) He’s the first cool
boyfriend I’ve ever had. Don’t
embarrass me!

JOSH (V.0.)
Don’t embarrass her, like I’m the
freak here.

They approach a tricked-out ACURA, a guy named CAL in the
driver’s seat. 18, unshaven, unwashed, tats, thinks a lot of
himself. Danni gets in. Josh moves up to the driver’s window.

JOSH
Hey, Cal, how are you?

Cal shrugs, too cool.

JOSH
Listen, we’re a little concerned
about Danni skipping school.

Cal REVS the engine, drowning out Josh’s voice.

JOSH
It’s really important that she keep
up her attendance --

Cal keeps REVVING the engine, Josh trying to talk over it
until finally:

DANNI
We gotta go, Dad!

Cal gives Josh a fuck-you sneer and peels out of the
driveway. Josh watches after the car, confounded.

JOSH (V.O)
People ask me all the time. Have
the aliens landed? Are they living
among us disguised as human beings?
(beat) Yes, they are.

INT. BEDROOM/JOSH'S HOUSE -- THAT NIGHT
Josh in bed. Barbara at the dressing table, moisturizing.
BARBARA
What are we going to do? We can’t
let her keep seeing him.
JOSH

Telling her not to will only make
it worse.
20.

BARBARA
You mean we can’t do anything? We
have no control at all?

JOSH
Speaking of control, don’t you
think your contract with Adam is a
little much?

BARBARA
No, he needs clear-cut boundaries.

JOSH
And what happens when you’re not
around to threaten him with
lawsuits?

Barbara gets into bed.

BARBARA
That was exactly your attitude with
Danni. Just let her do whatever

she wants. Never mind that she
doesn’t care about her appearance
or her grades or...herself.

She puts her head on Josh’s chest, sighs a parents’ sigh.

BARBARA
How did that happen?

JOSH
I don’t know.

Josh kisses her, then turns out the light.

JOSH V.O.
It’s human nature to try and
control your life and the people
you love. The mistake is thinking
you had any in the first place.

We hold here in the darkness. Faintly at first, we hear an
odd CRUNCHING SOUND. The camera moves off Josh and Barbara,
following the sound out of the bedroom and through the house,
the crunching getting louder and louder. Now we’re in the
kitchen heading towards the fridge, pushing through the door
to the little red cooler, then into the cooler itself to a
CLEAR PLASTIC PETRI DISH, nestled in ice, some WORMS inside.

SNAP ZOOM -- THE WORMS

They’re eating through the plastic.

END ACT 1
ACT 2
21.

EXT. DAIRY FARM -- DAY

Delila in small metal corral. She’s bellowing angrily,

ramming the gate with her head. Jim and Ellen watching.
ELLEN

She’s getting worse, Jim.

JIM
What the hell are those PCI people
doing?!
INT. STUDY/JOSH’'S HOUSE -- SAME DAY

Josh on the phone with Collin. On his computer screen is a
PHOTO OF A WORM that looks just like Delila’s worms.

JOSH
Delila’s worms are just your run-of-
the-mill coccidia. No reason they

should be causing anything worse
than a stomachache.

INTERCUT
INT. PCI -- CONTINUOUS
Collin on the speakerphone with Josh.

COLLIN
We've got a bigger problem.
Jim Crowley called. Delila is
deteriorating fast.

JOSH
How did her blood panel come back?

COLLIN
Negative. It’s not an infection,
drugs or toxicity.

JOSH
Which leads us back to the worms.

COLLIN
(grudging) Athena has a theory.

Athena appears alongside Collin. She has a large, antique
BOOK; the leather cover crumbling, pages yellow with age.

ATHENA
I had a chat with my Grandmother,
Josh.

(MORE )
22.

ATHENA (cont'd)
She said the worms reminded her of
something she heard about,
something to do with an Indian
tribe called the Michaguas. I
found them in one of her books.

As Athena continues we FLASH TO PRIMITIVE DRAWINGS in the
book appropriate to her narration.

ATHENA
The Michaguas lived in Peru about
the time Columbus sailed for
America. They used insects in their
religious ceremonies; hornets,
scorpions, army ants -- and worms.

JOSH
Interesting.

ATHENA
The high priests extracted the
worms from the stomachs of their
most ferocious bulls and then
performed a blood rite, basically,
black magic, which transformed the
worms into pequefios demonios, or
little demons.

COLLIN
Oh please --

ATHENA
The worms were fed to the dairy
cattle and then their milk was
given to the tribe’s warriors just
before a big battle. It made them
super-aggressive.

JOSH
And Delila is acting like a super-
aggressive bull. (then) What
happened to the dairy cattle?

ATHENA
The worms made them so crazy the
priests eventually had to kill
them.

JOSH
Doesn’t bode well for Delila.

COLLIN
Okay, let’s suppose Delila’s worms
are somehow related to your
ferocious-bull-black-magic-demon-
worms. How does that help us? Jim
said he might have to put Delila
down.
23.

JOSH
That’s a point. (beat) So let’s
skip the diagnostics for now and
find a way to kill the worms. Try
commercial de-wormers first.

COLLIN
I’m on it.

They hang up. We stay with Josh, thinking...

EXT. (FLASHBACK) LIVING ROOM/APARTMENT -- SAME EVENING

Young Josh looking out of the window. Below, he can see
Rachel emerge from the building, clusters of KIDS in
Halloween costumes moving past her. She stops, looks up at
him and waves. He waves back.

JOSH (V.0.)
I’ll always remember my Mom’s face
that night. In a way, it was the
last time I’d see it.

EXT. (FLASHBACK) APARTMENT BUILDING -- A MINUTE LATER

Young Josh comes out of the building wearing his backpack.
He looks to see that Rachel is really gone, then runs off in
the other direction.

INT. KITCHEN/JOSH'S HOUSE -- SAME DAY

Back to the present. Barbara arranging potato chips on a
platter in a precise pattern, Adam bringing a bowl of creamy
SOUR CREAM DIP out of the fridge. We catch a glimpse of the
red cooler.

BARBARA
I’ll tell you what, if you help me
serve snacks to Ted and LaSandra?
We'll forego 14B and 14C and use
the ad-interim clause to credit you
with compliance.

ADAM
I accept.

Barbara takes the bowl of dip from Adam and sets it in the
center of the platter.

BARBARA
There, that’s perfect.

We hear Cal’s Acura ROAR up to the house and then the HORN
honk. Barbara stiffens, can’t stand that sound.
24.

INT. HALLWAY/JOSH’S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

Danni comes out of her room, responding to the HORN. As she
starts down the hall, Josh comes out of the study. They stop,
look at each other, Josh perplexed, Danni defensive.

JOSH
You could do so much better, Danni.

DANNI
Actually, Dad, I can’t.

JOSH
Your Mom is right about him. He's
a jerk.

DANNI
Mom doesn’t care. She just doesn’t

want me to embarrass her.

JOSH
That’s not true at all.

The phone in Josh’s study RINGS.

JOSH
I have to get that.

DANNI
So get it.

She walks past him and exits.
EXT. JOSH'S HOUSE-- SAME DAY

Cal sitting in the Acura, HONKING the horn. A HAND REACHES
INTO FRAME and takes the key out of the ignition.

New angle: Barbara, standing at the driver’s side window,
keys in hand. Cal sneers.

CAL
What’s up, Barb?

BARBARA
Call me Mrs. Keeling and if you’re
going to pick up my daughter the
least you could do is knock on the
door.

CAL
I’m not really into knocking.

BARBARA
And from now on you will not bring
Danni home after her curfew and you
will not make her skip school.
25.

CAL
Yeah, well, here’s the thing, Barb.
(beat) Danni’s s my bitch now and
there’s nothing you can do about
it.

Barbara’s jaw drops. Cal takes his keys back as Danni gets
in the car.

DANNI
Let’s go already.

Cal cackles and peels out of the driveway.
INT. KITCHEN/JOSH’S HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER
Barbara enters, furious, beside herself.
BARBARA

Danni’s my bitch?! Danni’s my

bitch?!!
She tries to calm down but can’t. Impulsively, she grabs a
chip off the perfect platter, takes a big scoop of sour cream
dip and shoves it in her mouth.
INT. PCI -- SAME DAY

Collin working with chemicals, muttering to himself.

ATHENA (0.S.)
Collin?

Angle on Athena looking into the industrial fridge. She holds
up two empty PETRI DISHES, tiny holes chewed through them.

ATHENA
What happened to the worms?

INT. STUDY/JOSH’'S HOUSE -- SAME DAY

Josh on the phone.

JOSH
What do you mean the worms escaped?
INTERCUT
INT. PCI -- CONTINUOUS

Collin and Athena on the speakerphone with Josh.
COLLIN
I mean they chewed through the
polystyrene petri dishes.

FLASHBACK -- A SERIES OF SHOTS
26.

We're inside the industrial fridge, the worms squiggling out
of holes they’ve made in the petri dishes. They crawl on to
the fridge rack...

COLLIN (V.0O.)

Their reaction to the cold was to
seek a warmer temperature but once
they escaped the dishes they still
had to get out of the fridge.

The worms traveling along the bars of the rack. They’re so
tiny the distances from their perspective are enormous.

JOSH (V.O.)
Long way to go if you’re a worm.

COLLIN (V.0O.)
Exactly. And that’s why they
decided to generate their own heat.

JOSH (V.O.)
How?

COLLIN (V.0O.)

Sex, of course. But they needed
the proper environment, the
chemical equivalent of soft
lighting and a Luther VanDross CD.

».-the worms stop, raise their heads, look around...

COLLIN (V.0O.)

In their case it was free glucose,
acid triglycerides, casein
proteins, lactose and --

JOSH (V.0.)
Collin --

RESUME COLLIN AND ATHENA

looking into the open industrial fridge. A CARTON OF COTTAGE
CHEESE, A BOX OF YOGURT AND A QUART OF MILK are all bubbling
over with froth and worms.

COLLIN
Anything made with milk. Cottage
cheese, yogurt, ice cream.

ATHENA
Josh, didn’t you take some worms
home with you? And weren’t they in
petri dishes?

RESUME JOSH
27.

JOSH
Yeah, but the dishes were in a
cooler. (realizes) Also made of
polystyrene.

Just then, Josh catches a momentary glimpse of Barbara
crossing the hall. She’s walking backwards.

JOSH
I’ll call you back.

INT. KITCHEN/JOSH’S HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER

Josh rushes in, starts to open the fridge but sees the
platter of chips on the counter, chips missing, scoop marks
in the sour cream dip. He takes a closer look. The dip is

moving.

JOSH
Oh no!
The doorbell RINGS.
EXT. JOSH'S HOUSE -- A MOMENT LATER.

Ted and LaSandra are there, Ted with a bottle of wine.

LASANDRA
Remember, behave yourself.

TED
It’s not me you need to worry
about.

The door opens, Josh frazzled but covering.

JOSH
Ted! LaSandra! Nice to see you!
What’s going on?

LASANDRA
Barbara invited us for lunch?

JOSH
(beat) Right, yes, lunch! (then)
Why don’t you guys go on in the
living room and make yourselves
comfortable. I‘1ll see what’s
keeping Barb.

INT. BEDROOM/JOSH’S HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER

Josh enters, sees Barbara, sitting at the dressing table in
her slip. She’s unnervingly still.
28.

JOSH
Honey? (mo response) Honey, are
you okay?

Josh moves closer, sees Barbara’s reflection in the mirror, a
blank, bovine expression on her face. She’s looking at her
MAKEUP ITEMS like she’s never seen them before.

BARBARA
Have to..get ready...

JOSH
Why don’t you just stay put for
now? I‘’ll be back in a second.

INT. LIVING ROOM/JOSH’S HOUSE -- SAME DAY

Adam is serving the platter of chips and dip to Ted and
LaSandra.

ADAM
Help yourself. It’s Mom’s famous
onion sour cream dip.

TED
Why thank you, young man. Don’t
mind if I do.

Ted takes a chip, starts to scoop up some dip when the whole
platter is snatched away!

New angle: Josh with the platter.

JOSH
This is not for you! I mean, this
is not for anybody...people I mean.
These are, um, doggie treats.

ADAM
We have a dog?

JOSH
I'll get the real snacks.

ADAM
When did we get a dog?

Josh turns, stops short. Barbara standing in the doorway,
dress on backwards, hair half-combed, make-up smeared.

JOSH
Barb! Honey! Gosh!

~TED
Is she okay?
29.

JOSH
Yeah, yeah, she’s fine.

On Josh, covering his alarm...
INT. (FLASHBACK) WOODS -- SAME EVENING
Young Josh, apprehensive, following a narrow trail.

JOSH (V.0.)
I took a shortcut to the cemetery
but it was still a long walk.

Young Josh comes out of the trees and on to the crest of a
hill. There’s a sweeping view of the CEMETERY; row upon row
of headstones, crypts and mausoleums. The sun is going down.

JOSH (V.0.)
I wasn’t scared. Well, not a lot.
I mean let’s suppose I saw a ghost?
What was it going to do, eat me?

INT. DINING ROOM/JOSH’S HOUSE -- SAME DAY

Back to the present. Josh, Barbra, LaSandra and Ted having
lunch, everyone trying not to notice Barbara. She’s sniffing
her pasta salad.

JOSH
So how did you two meet?

TED
On the job. I’m a detective,
LaSandra’s a psychologist. I
consulted her on a case and it was
love at first sight.

LASANDRA
(teasing) For him, anyway.

TED
She tries to play it off but she
was all over me.

Barbara picks up her fork, sniffs that too.

JOSH
(covering) Are you guys planning a
family?
LASANDRA
That’s one of the reasons we moved
here. Seemed like the ideal place.
TED

Quiet, peaceful, the people are
just ordinary folks.
30.

Barbara reaches over to LaSandra’s plate, takes the PARSLEY
GARNISH, puts it in her mouth, chews languidly.

JOSH
(covering) Barb’s a vegetarian.
Loves anything green.

TED
I’m a meat man myself. Yeah, gimme
a big ol’ bloody hunk of beefsteak
anytime.

Offended, Barbara looks at him and bellows:

BARBARA
MOOOOO0000!!

EXT. JOSH'S HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER
Ted comes storming out, LaSandra following.

LASANDRA
Where are you going?!

TED
I’m going to get my badge and my
gun and then I’m going back in
there and haul those two nutcases
to jail!

She grabs him, turns him around.

LASANDRA
Stop it, Ted! You can’t arrest
them for being nut -- you can’t

arrest them!

TED
Well I am not living next door to
people that serve doggie treats,
and make animal noises!

LASANDRA
Yes, I know, it was strange.

TED
Did you see Barbara? She had her
dress on backwards! That’s not
strange, that’s crazy!

LASANDRA
I think they’re having some kind of
family crisis. If we just give
them some time to work through it
I’m sure they'll be fine.

TED
Well they better be fine. They
better be damn fine!

EXT. CAL’S PLACE -- SAME DAY

A ramshackle two-story house. Cal and his BAND MEMBERS
sitting on the porch, throwing back beers.

BAND MEMBER 1
If we’re gonna party tonight we
need booze money.

BAND MEMBER 2
I’m tapped out.

CAL
Me too.

BAND MEMBER 3
What about your scrag?

Angle on Danni, in the yard, washing Cal’s car.
CAL

I'll find out. She’s gotta be good

for something.
INT. KITCHEN/JOSH'S HOUSE -- SAME DAY
Adam frightened. Through the pass-through he can see into
the dining room and living room. Barbara is meandering
around, bellowing and knocking things over, gradually losing
her mind.
EXT. BACKYARD/JOSH'’S HOUSE -- SAME DAY

A frantic Josh, talking on his CELL with one hand and
inexplicably MOWING THE LAWN with the other.

worms!
INTERCUT
INT. PCI -- CONTINUOUS

Collin and Athena on the speaker phone with Josh.

COLLIN
Barbara did what?!

ATHENA
Oh my God!
32.

JOSH
We need a de-wormer, Collin.

COLLIN
The commercial ones don’t work!
I’ve tried them all. The worms
don’t even react!

JOSH
Then formulate one yourself. I'm
on my way.

COLLIN
Right!

They disconnect, we _stay with Collin and Athena. Collin
starts bustling around, gathering chemicals and muttering to
himself. Athena thinks a bit, then grabs her jacket and
exits the office.

RESUME JOSH

taking the GRASS CATCHING BAG off the lawn mower. He rushes
towards the house with it as Adam comes out.

ADAM
Dad! What’s wrong with Mom?

JOSH
She’s not feeling well, Adam.

Josh hurries past Adam and into the house.
INT. DEN/JOSH'’S HOUSE -- SAME DAY

Barbara lumbering around, huffing and grunting and banging
into things. She stops, smells something, sniffs loudly.

We follow her following her nose through various rooms and
then into the hallway to an open door. She looks inside.
Stairs lead down to the basement. Piled on the cement floor
is an inviting MOUND OF FRESHLY MOWN GRASS. Barbara huffs
approvingly. She descends the stairs, and the door slams
shut behind her!

INT. HALLWAY/JOSH’S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

Josh has just shut the door, Adam looking on. Immediately,
we hear Barbara trying to get out but Josh jams a HOCKEY
STICK between the door and the opposite wall, wedging it
closed.

ADAM
You’re locking Mom in the basement?
33.

JOSH
Just for a little while, until she
feels better!

INT. BASEMENT/JOSH’S HOUSE -- SAME DAY

Barbara still trying to get out. She hears VOICES, bounds
down the stairs, crosses to a narrow transom (too narrow for
escape) that’s just above ground level. Through it she can
see Josh and Adam come out of the house.

EXT. JOSH'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS
Josh moving quickly to his car, Adam trailing.

ADAM
What’s going on, Dad?

JOSH
It’s a long story, Adam. T’ll
explain it to you later.

ADAM
Where are you going?!

JOSH
To the office.

He stops, kneels, takes Adam by the shoulders.

JOSH
Now listen to me closely. Don’t go
in the kitchen, don’t eat anything,
and whatever you do, don’t let Mom
out of the basement, do you

understand?
ADAM

But Dad --
JOSH

You’re in charge while I’m gone,
Adam. I’m counting on you.

Josh gets in his car and drives away. On Adam, alone and
afraid.

EXT. (FLASHBACK) HILL OVERLOOKING CEMETERY-- NIGHT

It’s dark now. Young Josh drinking a chocolate milk through
a straw. Finished, he puts the empty carton into his
backpack and surveys the cemetery. It’s quiet and still.
Disappointed, he sighs, stands up, puts on his backpack...

»..and then a DARK SHAPE glides silently out of the trees
nearby.
34.

Young Josh freezes, watches the shape move through the air as
effortlessly as a bird carried on the wind, swooping in
circles around the cemetery and then descending, landing
silently on the ground. It’s a WITCH, young, gaunt, flowing
robe, piercing eyes.

CU YOUNG JOSH

stunned.

END ACT 2

ACT 3

INT. PCI -- SAME DAY

Collin is conducting an experiment. THE BOX OF WORMY COTTAGE
CHEESE we saw before is enclosed in a large AQUARIUM.
35.

At either end of the aquarium are TWO ELECTRONIC DEVICES that
look like modified radar guns. A BEAM is shining from one
device to the other, passing through the cottage cheese.

Both devices are humming, indicator lights flashing.

Josh bursts in, crosses quickly to Collin.

JOSH
Where are we?!

COLLIN
I’m trying to kill the worms
electromagnetically without hurting
any cellular structures around it.

JOSH
So the cottage cheese is Barbara?

COLLIN
Yes. The question is, will the
worms die and leave Bar -- the

cottage cheese intact.

Collin turns dials and pushes buttons, the humming gets
louder, the lights more intense, the worms squiggling.

COLLIN
They’re reacting...

The cottage cheese EXPLODES, covering the inside of the
aquarium, muck shooting up to the ceiling.

EXT. DAIRY FARM -- SAME DAY

Delila still ramming the gate on the breeding stall,
weakening it, Jim and Ellen watching, worried.

ELLEN

What happens if she gets out of

there, Jim?
They look at each other.
INT. LIVING ROOM/FARMHOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER
Jim enters, crosses to a gun rack and finds a DEER RIFLE.
INT. PCI -- SAME DAY
Josh and Collin staring at the aquarium mess.

COLLIN
I’m sorry, Josh.

JOSH
It’s okay. This is all my fault.
36.

Athena enters, excited.

ATHENA
I have something!

Athena shows them a small APOTHECARY BOTTLE. She opens it,
spills what looks like a FINE, UNIFORM GRAVEL into her hand.

ATHENA
Laccophilia Hydrolatus.
A parasitic beetle. They're
dehydrated.

COLLIN

Dehydrated beetles?

ATHENA
The Laccophilia live in the desert
and during the dry times they
burrow underground and basically
hibernate. They can stay that way
for years, and then when the rains
come, they rehydrate and come back
to life.

JOSH
Where did you get them?

ATHENA
An herbalist in Chinatown. My
grandmother's boyfriend.

COLLIN
I don’t understand.

ATHENA
The Laccophilia will eat the worms.

JOSH
They do this in commercial
agriculture. Introduce one
parasite to get rid of another.

COLLIN
But if the Laccophilia are inside a
living body, won’t they propagate?
Won’t we just be replacing the
worms with Laccophilia?

ATHENA
They have a short life cycle, a few
hours, and these are just males.

COLLIN
How can you tell?
37.

ATHENA
Because they’re wearing little jock
straps -- that’s what the herbalist
told me!

COLLIN

But you said worms are demonized.
Won't they be resistant to ordinary
Laccophilia?

ATHENA
They’re demonized too. Me, the
herbalist and my grandmother did a
little ritual on them.

INT. (FLASHBACK) HERBALIST SHOP -- DAY

Athena, ATHENA’S GRANDMOTHER and an ELDELRY CHINESE HERBALIST
performing a ritual over the apothecary bottle, making
strange movements, chanting in Chinese and Spanish, incense
burning.

RESUME SCENE

ATHENA
The herbalist is a heavy dude.

COLLIN
Is this something like what you did
in the barn with Delila?

ATHENA
Could we just try it please?!

INT. BASEMENT/JOSH’S HOUSE -- SAME DAY

Barbara, growling as she tries to shoulder down the door but
it won’t budge. Defeated, she descends the steps to the
basement floor and snarls in frustration. Then she hears
something, FOOTSTEPS coming from above. She tracks the sound
with her eyes.

INT. DEN/JOSH’S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

Adam crossing, plunking down in front of the TV. He watches

for a bit, and then he hears Barbara, an unsettling bovine
thrum in her voice.

BARBARA (0.S.)
Adammmm....oh Adammmmmmm...

On Adam, uh-oh...
INT. PCI -- SAME DAY

Athena, Josh and Collin gathered around a tall BEAKER OF
WATER. Athena adds the dried Laccophilia to the water.
38.

ATHENA
Rehydrate the Laccophilia...

The Laccophilia drift down in the water, gradually coming
alive as they descend. They look like tiny tadpoles.

JOSH
They’re coming to life!

Athena puts some worms in the beaker.

ATHENA
Versus Delila’s worms...

A SERIES OF SHOTS

The presence of the worms excites the Laccophilia. They
swirl around the worms and start savagely consuming them.

COLLIN
They're like piranhas. They’re
eating the worms alive!

JOSH
But will the same thing happen
inside a living body? This is my
wife we’re talking about.

COLLIN
Yes, they could very well attack
the tissue around them and eat
Barbara’s stomach lining or chew
through her intestines or -- (off
Josh’s look) Sorry.

JOSH
We'll have to test it on Delila.

ATHENA
You guys pack up. I'll get the van.

JOSH
Athena? (she hesitates) Nice work.

Athena smiles and rushes out. The guys start gathering the
equipment they’ll need. Collin stops, looks at Josh.

COLLIN
Is this why you hired a witch?
This kind of situation?

JOSH
I hired her for a lot of reasons.

EXT. (FLASHBACK) HILLSIDE OVERLOOKING CEMETERY -- SAME NIGHT
39.

Young Josh, still watching the Witch. She’s standing on a
crypt, staring off into the night sky, waiting. And now
another WITCH comes gliding into view, landing near the
first. Then ANOTHER comes walking through the headstones,
and then ANOTHER sails into view...and then ANOTHER...and
then ANOTHER...a coven.

INT. DEN/JOSH'’S HOUSE -- SAME DAY

Back to the present. Adam has a pillow over his head. He's
trying to shut out the sound of his mother’s voice.

Josh, Collin and Athena, Josh driving fast. His cell RINGS.
He answers:

Jim talking on his CELL, watching Delila ramming the stall
gate, the hinges giving way.

JIM
I’ve got neighbors with kids! If
somebody gets hurt --

JOSH
If you shoot her we can’t test the
Laccophilia!

JIM

Test the what?

Delila gets her horns interlocked in the gate, gives it a
mighty shake. The hinges snap, the gate about to come off.

JIM
She’s getting out!

Jim drops his cell, grabs the deer rifle...

ON JOSH
yelling into his cell.

JOSH
Don’t shoot her! Don’t shoot her!

From the cell he hears: BANG! BANG!

JOSH
Oh no --

RESUME DAIRY FARM

Ellen is driving the TRACTOR towards the stall, the motor
BACKFIRING (the bangs) As Delila pushes the gate down, the
tractor pushes it back in place and holds it there, Delila
held in for now. Elated, Jim waves his hat.

JIM
Yeee-ha! That’s my girl!

Ellen beams. Jim picks up his cell.

JIM
We're okay. We didn’t shoot her.

JOSH (V.0.)
Thank, God!

INT. UPSTAIRS BEDROOM/CAL’S PLACE -- SAME DAY

Apres sex. Danni on the raggedy futon, blanket pulled up
around her. Cal in his underwear, going through the pockets
of her jeans.

DANNI
I don’t have more money, Cal. I
spent it on gas for your car!

CAL
We gotta buy booze for the party.
Frustrated, Cal throws her jeans at her. Then:
CAL

What about your parents?

DANNI
What about them?

EXT. DAIRY FARM --SAME DAY
XCU -- HYPODERMIC DART

liquid filled, swimming with Laccophilia.

New angle. Collin loading the dart into the M-PAC; Josh,
Athena, Jim and Ellen looking on.

JOSH
Go ahead.

Collin aims at Delila and fires. The dart whizzes through
the air and sticks in her haunch. She bellows.

JIM
Now what?
JOSH
We wait.
EXT. (FLASHBACK) CEMETERY -- SAME NIGHT
Young Josh watching the coven of Witches. There are about a

dozen of them, in their 20’s and 30’s, not hideous-looking
but a witchly gleam in their eyes. They’re doing a strange
dance, circling around a crypt. One of them makes some
especially wild gyrations, her face revealed in a shaft of
moonlight. It’s Rachel, Josh’s Mom.

YOUNG JOSH
Mom!

Shocked and terrified, Young Josh stumbles back, loosening
some rocks which roll down the hill.

THE WITCHES

react to the sound, stop their dancing, alerted. One of
them sees an indiscernible figure (Young Josh) retreating
into the treeline. She points, lets out an ungodly SCREECH.

A SERIES OF SHOTS

The Witches chase Young Josh through the dark woods, howling
and caterwauling. As the sequence concludes, Young Josh
arrives at the edge of a SWAMP. He looks back, can see the
Witches coming. He thinks a moment, then picks up a ROCK and
throws it, skipping it across the water.

MOMENTS LATER

The Witches arrive at the edge of the swamp. They can see
the RIPPLES in the water left by the skipping rock. They
move off in that direction but Rachel remains, looking
around, sensing something. Panning down, we can see Josh
underwater, face up, pinching his nose and breathing via the
straw he was using to drink the chocolate milk. He’s looking
right at Rachel. On his terrified eyes...

EXT. JOSH'S HOUSE -- THAT NIGHT

Adam dithers, then starts to remove the hockey stick bracing
the door shut.

BARBARA
That’s a good boy, Adam!

Adam stops, something occurring to him.

ADAM
Mom?

BARBARA
(very tight) Yes...sweetheart?

ADAM
This is sort of like my allowance.

EXT. DAIRY FARM -- SAME NIGHT
Josh, Athena, Collin, Jim and Ellen, watching Delila
gradually become quieter...and calmer...and then her eyes

return to normal.

JIM
Will you look at that!

Jim approaches Delila, reaches out, scratches her head. She
huffs contentedly. Jim is too moved to speak. Ellen hugs
Josh, Athena and Collin in turn.

Thank you! MThank you all so much!

JOSH
We have to go.

Barbara starts to respond but hears a car ROAR up to the

can see the Acura in the driveway, Danni and Cal inside, Cal
yelling at her, Danni about to cry. Barbara snarls.

Barbara bellows, goes into a mindless rage, knocking things

over, dumping out boxes and bins until something clatters to
the cement floor. A CROWBAR.

Ted and LaSandra still trying to watch TV, the POUNDING

sounds from next door continuing.

TED
That’s it. Enough is enough!

LASANDRA
Don’t get involved over there, Ted.
Just call the police.

TED
I am the police!

EXT. STROUDS HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER

Ted comes out, crosses towards Josh’s house, LaSandra
to him.

LASANDRA
Be careful, Ted!

The PCI van pulls into the driveway. Josh jumps out,
to his front door, blocking Ted’s path.

JOSH
Ted! What’s going on?

TED
It’s your house, Josh, how the hell
would I know?!
Josh hears the POUNDING.
JOSH
Oh that? Yeah, we’re having a
little work done on the house.
The door opens, Adam there, crying.

ADAM
Mommy’s got a crowbar!

TED
(at Josh) Mommy’s got a crowbar?

JOSH
She’s a real do-it-yourselfer.

TED
Get outta my way!

INT. VARIOUS ROOMS -- CONTINUOUS
Ted moving through the house, Josh and Adam trailing.
JOSH
Don’t you need a warrant to come in
here, Ted?
TED
Not if I have probable cause that a
crime is being committed and Lord
knows I have that!
They arrive at the basement door. It’s completely
demolished. A trail of destruction leads away from them,
down the hall to the open back door. Barbara’s gone.
Ted glares at Josh.
JOSH

(wanly) She probably went out for
some air.

gestures at the M-PAC.

ATHENA
You know, I was thinking, maybe you
could teach me how to use that
sometime.

COLLIN
Sure. Okay. (then) That was really
interesting, what you did with the
Laccophilia and the worms?

ATHENA
Thanks.

COLLIN
The notion of a ritualistic
transmutation is very intriguing
although I still think there might
be a biochemical explanation. I
hope you’re open to discussing it.

ATHENA
Anytime, Collin.

On Athena, smiling to herself.

INT. CAL'S PLACE -- SAME NIGHT

A loud drunken party in progress. A self-conscious

street. He arrives at his apartment building.

JOSH (V.0.)
I ran all the way home...

INT. (FLASHBACK) BEDROOM/APARTMENT -- MOMENTS LATER

Young Josh staggers in, rips off his wet clothes and gets
into bed. He huddles there, trembling.

JOSH (V.0.)
Had my Mother seen me? What would
she say? What would she do? (beat)
Did I still have a mother?

INT. PCI VAN -- SAME NIGHT

Back to the present. Josh and the group still driving around
looking for Barbara.

ADAM
»..-Mom was really mad and screaming
and everything, and then when Danni
came back she got super-mad.

JOSH
Danni came back?

ADAM
With that guy, and then they left
again. That was when Mom really

went ballistic.

JOSH
(realizes) She wouldn’t...

ATHENA
What, Josh?

JOSH
Barbara hates Danni’s boyfriend, a
guy named Cal. (trying to remember)
She told me where he lived --

COLLIN
You think she went after him?

JOSH
(remembers) The landfill! She said
he lived near the landfill!
50.

EXT. LANDFILL -- SAME NIGHT

A long shot of Cal’s place perched on the edge of the
landfill, a vast crater.

PULLING BACK TO BARBARA'S SILHOUETTE
INT. STAIRS/CAL'S PLACE -- SAME NIGHT
Danni comes up the stairs, reaches the second floor hallway.

DANNI
Cal? Are you up here?

She moves down the hall to a door, opens it...
INT. BEDROOM/CAL’S PLACE -- CONTINUOUS
Danni enters.

DANNI
Cal?

She stops abruptly. Cal and a GIRL are on the futon making
out, a BOTTLE OF VODKA on the floor next to them. Danni is
mortified. Cal looks at her, sneers.

DANNI
You are such a jerk.

CAL
Close the door and get out.

DANNI
Fine, just give me my booze back!

Danni crosses, grabs the vodka. Cal grabs her wrist.

CAL
Drop it.

DANNI
No!

GIRL

I’m outta here.
The Girl gets up and exits.

CAL
Let go of the bottle, Danni.

DANNI
It’s mine, I paid for it!
51.

Danni tries to yank free but he’s too strong, standing up
while he twists her wrist, bringing her to her knees. She
cries out in pain.

CAL
Let go or I’ll break your arm!

A shadow falls over them. Barbara in the doorway. Cal
sneers.

CAL
What’s up, Barb?

Barbara steps forward. She’s completely berserk, enraged,
demonized.

DANNI
Mom?

She walks towards Cal, her voice like the growl of a beast.

BARBARA
Call..me...Mrs..Keeling!!

Barbara gives him a two-hand shove in the chest. He's
knocked backwards, hits the wall hard. She catches him on
the rebound and slings him into the dresser, smashing it.

DANNI
Mom?

Cal tries to get up but Barbara puts a foot on the side of
his head, mashing him into the floor.

BARBARA
You little punk! You and your car
and your tattoos and your band!
YOU'RE NOT GOOD ENOUGH TO WIPE THE
DIRT OFF MY DAUGHTER'S SHOES!!

CAL
Get off me! Get off me you
freakin’ old hag!

BARBARA
Oh I see. A potty mouth.

INT. BATHROOM/CAL’S PLACE -- MOMENTS LATER

Barbara is holding Cal’s head in the toilet while he flails
futilely, Danni watching, aghast, but digging it.

BARBARA
You think I hate you, Danni?! I
gave birth to you!

(MORE )
52.

BARBARA (cont'd)
I worry about you and wish for you
and want for you and ache for you
and breathe for you every single
minute of every single day! I AM
YOUR MOTHERRRR!!!

Danni is awed by her mother’s tirade but notices:

DANNI
Mom? I don’t think he’s moving.

Barbara yanks the sputtering Cal out of the toilet. She pulls
him close, looks him right in the eye.

BARBARA
So tell me something, Cal. (beat)
Who's the bitch now?!

INT. BEDROOM/CAL’S PLACE -- MOMENTS LATER

Barbara bum-rushing Cal out of the bathroom, across the room,
through the french doors, Danni trailing.

DANIELL
Mom, don’t!

EXT. BALCONY/CAL’S PLACE -- CONTINUOUS

Barbara brings Cal to the railing, starts to heave him over.
A 200 foot drop to the bottom of the landfill.

BARBARA
So long, asshole!

JOSH (0.S.)
Barbara!

Barbara hesitates, sees Josh, Adam, Collin (with the M-PAC)
and Athena down below but off to one side(ground level).
They've just come around the side of the house.

JOSH
(to Collin) Go on up there, get
ready to dart her.

Collin moves off.
JOSH
Don’t do it, Barb! He’s had
enough.
Barbara snarls, not willing to let Cal go.
JOSH

You've made your point, honey.
Hasn’t she Cal?
53.

CAL
(blubbering) Oh yes! Yes she has!
I swear, Mrs. Keeling ma’am!

Barbara bellows defiantly, starts to turn Cal over the
railing.

CAL
NOOOOOO!!

But Barbara stops.
New angle: Danni has put a hand on her shoulder.

DANNI
(tearful) It’s okay, Mom.

They look at each other.

DANNI
I love you too.

Danni hugs her. Barbara’s rage softens, turns into tears.

 

She hugs Danni...and lets go of Cal. He plummets, screaming
like a girl, hitting the landfill and disappearing into the
sea of garbage. PHLOOOF!! Everyone except Barbara wincing at

the sound.
INT. (FLASHBACK) KITCHEN/APARTMENT -- NEXT MORNING

Young Josh enters. Rachel is at the counter, making a bag
lunch, humming, everything normal. She notices him. He
tries to control his fear.

RACHEL
Good morning, Josh. Sleep okay?

YOUNG JOSH
Yeah. I slept fine.

RACHEL
What did you do last night?

YOUNG JOSH
Oh, the usual stuff, you know.

RACHEL
Want some breakfast?

JOSH
No thanks. I’m supposed to get to
school early. Hockey practice.

RACHEL
Okay. Well, here’s your lunch.
54.

She gives him his bag lunch. They look at each other a long
beat, Josh trying to see something in her eyes.

JOSH (V.0.)
I didn’t realize it then, but that
Halloween night was my very first
case.

Rachel smiles warmly, kisses him on the forehead.

RACHEL
See you later.

Following Young Josh out of the kitchen, down the hall to the
front door.

JOSH (V.0.)
It was also the start of my career,
when a kid’s curiosity became a
calling. I had to find out, what's
really going on here?

Young Josh starts to exit but glances back. Rachel is
standing at the sink, staring out of the window at the sky.
He looks at her, wondering.

JOSH (V.0.)
So what was my Mom doing in the
cemetery that night? I still don’t
know, but the case isn’t closed..
»..-not by a long shot.

EXT. JOSH'S HOUSE -- MORNING

Back to the present. Josh comes out, heads towards his
newspaper on the lawn. He sees Ted, doing the same.

JOSH
Hey, Ted. Listen, about what
happened...

TED
I’m not havin’ it, Josh. Are you
hearing me? I’m not havin’ it.

Ted points a finger at Josh, then turns and walks into his
house. On Josh, breathing a weary sigh.

INT. STUDY/JOSH’S HOUSE -- SAME DAY

Josh on the phone with an official from the US Department of
Agriculture. Intermittently, we hear a loud GRINDING SOUND.
55.

USDA OFFICIAL 1 (V.O.)
I can assure you, Mr. Keeling, we
here at the Department of
Agriculture monitor the country’s
milk supply very carefully --

JOSH
I wasn’t suggesting --

USDA OFFICIAL 1 (V.O.)
-- and we've received no reports of
contaminated milk or cattle
displaying the symptoms you
describe.

JOSH
No reports at all?

USDA OFFICIAL (V.0O.)
Not one. (beat) But you say this
particular cow was affected by
worms?

JOSH
Yes.

USDA OFFICIAL (V.O.)
What kind of worms?

JOSH
Well, they were a garden-variety
coccidia but they were demonized.

USDA OFFICIAL 1 (V.O.)
Demon worms?

JOSH
Yes.

The GRINDING SOUND is distracting.

JOSH
Could you hold on for just a
second?
INT. ADAM’S ROOM/JOSH’S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

The source of the GRINDING SOUND. Adam and Barbara are
feeding the pages of his contract into a SHREDDER.

RESUME JOSH
closing the his study door, picking up the phone again.

JOSH
Sorry about that.
56.

USDA OFFICIAL 1 (V.O.)
That’s okay. Listen, I’ve got
somebody else on the line with me
whose more familiar with this kind
of thing.

JOSH
Oh great.

USDA OFFICIAL 2 (V.O.)
Mr. Keeling? Yeah, My name’s Jerry
Cooper. I’m the supervisor here at
the USDA’s Demon Worm and Goblin
Grasshopper Department?

Josh realizes they’re messing with him.

JOSH
Listen, I know how this sounds --

USDA OFFICIAL 2 (V.0O.)
No, no, we think you're really on
to something here. In fact, we’re
sending a crack team of agents to
your house right now.

USDA OFFICIAL 1 (V.0O.)
You'll recognize them by their big
shoes. They put the worms on the
sidewalk and stomp on ‘em!

The Officials burst into hysterics. Josh hangs up.
INT. LIVING ROOM/JOSH’S HOUSE -- SAME DAY
Josh and Barbara snuggling on the couch.

JOSH
How are you feeling?

BARBARA
I’m fine. (off his look) Really.
Oh I have the occasional urge to
graze but other than that --

JOSH
I was afraid I was going to lose
you.
He kisses her.
JOSH

I’m so sorry.

BARBARA
I know you are...but I have to
admit, it wasn’t all bad.
57.

INT. ACURA -- SAME DAY

Cal, hysterical and blubbering, driving on a desert highway
really fast. He whips past a sign that says: LEAVING THE
GOLDEN STATE. COME AGAIN SOON!

RESUME JOSH AND BARBARA
the conversation continuing.

JOSH
I think it’s going to take awhile
to patch things up with Ted and
LaSandra.

BARBARA
I’ll talk to LaSandra. (bright
idea) I’ll tell her I had the flu.

JOSH
(not hopeful) Yeah, that might
work.
Danni enters.
JOSH

Hey, kiddo.
Reveal Danni’s companion. A very butch girl named RITA.

DANNI
This is my friend Rita. We'll be
in my room.

Danni and Rita move off. On Josh and Barbara, speechless.

EXT. PCI -- DAY

JOSH (V.0.)
The Department of Agriculture guys
weren’t very receptive...

INT. PCI -- CONTINUOUS
Josh, Athena and Collin, a discussion in progress.

JOSH
...-but that’s not what bothered me.
(beat) They said they haven’t
received any reports about
contaminated milk or possessed
cows.

ATHENA
But isn’t that good?
58.

JOSH
Think about it. Somebody gave
demonized worms to one cow.

COLLIN
Right. Why not a hundred cows or a
thousand?

JOSH

And why here, why not in Wisconsin,
the Dairy State? Why pick a place
that’s less than an hour’s drive
from this office?

ATHENA
Are you saying --

JOSH
Just hear me out, okay? Somebody
feeds Delila a handful of hay
contaminated with the worms. Then
Delila shows symptoms that defy
explanation so Jim goes online and
looks for help. Chatrooms, message
boards, that kind of thing. What
kind of response would he get?

COLLIN
Oh, the usual palaver from the
uninformed but anybody who knows
anything would refer him to you.

JOSH
Especially here in my own backyard.

ATHENA
You mean you were supposed to get
the case?

JOSH
And take the worm samples. It’s
standard operating procedure.

COLLIN
So what happened to Barbara --

JOSH
Was meant for me. Us. It was only
by chance we didn’t eat or drink
anything that was contaminated.

ATHENA
But who would want to set us up?
59.

JOSH
I don’t know, but they had to be
able to demonize the worms..this
wasn’t just anybody.

INT. LIVING ROOM/FARMHOUSE -- NIGHT
Jim, asleep in his rocker, the TV on.

JOSH (V.0.)
Somebody once said, the only normal
people are the ones you don’t know
very well...

New angle. Ellen, standing in the doorway, looking at him.
Her farm wife demeanor is gone, replaced with a whole other
persona; confident, mysterious, a little menacing.

JOSH (V.0.)
»..and how many people do you know
that well? I mean really?

Music begins. The Talking Heads sing “Once In A Lifetime”
continuing over...

EXT. DAIRY FARM -- SAME NIGHT
Ellen comes out of the house, moves off into the night.
TRACKING ELLEN

walking through the countryside, completely at ease in the
dark. As the sequence concludes she goes through a
DILAPIDATED WOODEN GATE, stops.

Reverse angle: We're in a small, neglected GRAVEYARD,
overgrown with weeds. Rachel is there, middle-aged now,
still attractive, wearing regular clothes. The two women
look at each other, smile.

ELLEN
We tried.

RACHEL
And we’ll try again.

EXT. GRAVEYARD -- SAME NIGHT

Rachel and Ellen are doing the same witches dance Young Josh
Saw on Halloween Night. Pulling back as other middle-aged
WOMEN come walking, gliding and flying over the hills and
through the fields and out of the night sky, converging on
the graveyard....
