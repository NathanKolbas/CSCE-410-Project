EXT. OCEAN/NIGHT SKY

A beautiful summer night. The sky is peaceful. Content.
The ocean calm and still. icturesque. As seen from...

EXT. DOCK

A small wooden dock protruding out into the water. The
middle of nowhere. Sitting at the edge is a MAN, late 20's,
big guy, brawny. He sits, shoulders slumped, feet dangling
over the side.

CLOSE ON his face. Distant. Tortured. He swigs from a
liquor bottle. From the pocket of his fishing slicker he
withdraws an object.

CLOSE ON his hand. He holds a small silver medallion. Round
and turning. A trinket of sorts. A keepsake. He holds it
up to his face as a summer breeze causes it to spin in his
hand. It WHISTLES in the wind.

Brush RUSTLES behind him. Then, a soft THUMPING. Footsteps
maybe? The man turns, peering into the darkness. A moment.
Nothing. A noise of the night. He turns back to the water.
Water CRASHES against pilings. Wood CREAKS as the dock
contantly settles. The man looks about again, this time
staggering to his feet when suddenly... .
FIREWORKS EXPLODE, in the distance, illuminating the sky,
interrupting the night. He looks up to the sky, his face
reflecting the spray of color as...

CUT TO:
EXT, SOUTHPORT ~- ESTABLISHING
ANOTHER EXPLOSION OF FIREWORKS

North Carolina. A tiny community pocketed on a harbor.
CROWDS of people CHEER from the boardwalk that runs along the
water. MUSIC BLARES from a locel.band.
EXT. MAIN STREET - SAME
A huge banner draped over the street reads...

SOUTHPORT CELEBRATES THE 47TH ANNUAL FOURTH OF JULY CROAKER
FESTIVAL.

The CAMERA BREEZES through the crowds: es people dance and

heads--elaborate hats shaped like Croaker fish. A small
scale Marci Gras-like celebration.

The CAMERA dead-ends at a building. The sign in front reads
TOWN HALL.

MC'S VOICE
(voice over)
How about a hand for our finalists!

SMASH CUT:
INT. TOWN HALL - SAME
An old town hall packed with people. Standing room only.
The crowd breaks into APPLAUSE.as five bikini clad girls file
onto the stage. A banner behind them reads...
THE ANNUAL MISS CROAKER QUEEN PAGEANT.
CLOSE ON the girls standing at attention. Poised, nervous,
excited. One girl, HELEN SHIVERS, stands out from the
others. She's more beautiful and self-assured. Confident
and sexy. Eyes of fire. She looks to the balcony above and
gives a special wink.
INT. BALCONY - SAME

A small balcony overlooking the stage. Closed to the public.
Used mainly for storage.

THREE TEENS, however, stand at the rail, watching the
pageant, out of sight from below. CLOSE ON...

JULIE JAMES, 17, pretty with a clever face and piercing eyes.
Carries herself with a determined, intense energy. A girl
going somewhere. .

JULIE .
God, look at her. She was born for this.

She's talking to...
RAY BRONSON, 17, @ tall and lanky guy, cute with glasses.
Studious with a mischievous grin permanently attached to his
face.
RAY
I had no idea her breasts were
so...ample.

She jabs him. Next to Ray is...

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

BARRY COX, 17, athletic and perfectly handsome with that all-
American/quarterback/class president appeal. A bit cocky.
Likes his tough guy image.

BARRY
She does these exercises that pump ‘em
up.

Julie stares them down,

JULIE
Guys, I'm on sexist overload as it is.
Kill the commentary.

BACK ON STAGE

The Master of Ceremonies, a big, burly man--the town mayor no
doubt--stands next to Helen. It's the final round, that
moment when they ask that big, self-serving, life affirming
question.

MC
In the spirit of.Mother Theresa, what
will be your contribution to your
community and the world at large?

Helen takes the microphone from him, steps forward, and
addresses the audience with confident certainty.

HELEN
Well, Bob, at summer's end, I plan to
move to New York City where I'll pursue a
- serious acting career. It is my goal to
entertain the world through artistic
expression. Through art I shall serve my
country...

UP IN THE BALCONY
Her friends listen.

RAY
Did you feed her this shit?

Julie shrugs and grins. Maybe she did, maybe she didn't.
BARRY .
Work it, babe. Man, they're eating it
up. She's incredible.

SMASH CUT:
INT. STAGE - LATER

MC
And this year's Croaker Queen is...

The final contestants stand in frenzied anticipation as the
MC opens the envelope.

MISS HELEN SHIVERS!
THUNDEROUS APPLAUSE fills the town hall.
UP IN THE BALCONY -

Julie, Ray, and Barry nearly leap from the rail in
excitement. HOOTING, HOLLERING, CHEERING her on.

BACK ON STAGE

A diamond tiara is placed atop Helen's head by last year's
outgoing Croaker Queen as a red satin sash is draped around
her nearly naked body. She's handed a glittering scepter and
it's official. Helen Shivers is MISS CROAKER QUEEN 1997.
She's all tears.

EXT. OLLIE'S OYSTER BAR ~- LATER

MUSIC BLARES as Ollie's out door Gance floor is packed with
people, dancing their brains out.

Barry and Ray lean against a rail, overlooking the
dancefloor. The harbour in view behind them. Fishing
trawlers and yachts line the docks. Buoys CLANG in the
harbors wake. Barry swigs froma bottle of beer as they look
down on a brand new shiny black BMW that sits in the parking
lot. .

BARRY .
2.8 Liter, 6 cyclinder, 190 Horse Power,
optional sun roof.

RAY
Dude, you cleaned up.

Ray admires the car. His eves revealing the slightest trace
of envy.

BARRY
What did you get for graduation?

RAY
Lear jet. With pilot.

BARRY
And how many food stamps did that set
your aunt back? Jesus, what's taking
them so long?

He looks down to the crowded bar below. Ray shrugs.

RAY
She had to deflate her breasts.

BARRY
(laughs, swigging a beer)
It's fucked, man. I'm going to Boston U
with your girl and you'll be in New York
with mine.

RAY
Dyslexic, huh? ©

BARRY .
We could swap, you know. Make it easier
on everybody.

RAY
Agreed.

Barry cuts the crap for a moment.

BARRY
Or you could just keep an eye on Helen
for me. Make sure she's okay and stuff.

Ray eyes him. The guy's earnest.

RAY
I tell you what. You keep an eye on
Julie and I'll cover Helen.

A moment between friends. Barry thumps Ray's forehead. An
act of love.

BARRY
You're okay, you know that? When you
first came here I had my doubts about
you. But you turned out alright.

RAY
Your colossal influence.

EXT. BATHROOM - SECONDS LATER

Julie and Helen emerge from the mobbed oyster bar bathroom.
They gab and talk.

CONTINUED:

HELEN
How's my hair?

JULIE
Hurricane proof.

HELEN
Hey, it's all about the hair. Don't you
forget that. Especially when you become
some big hotshot lawyer. Those
professional women types think it's all
about brains and ability and completely
ignore the "do".

JULIE
“Do's" vital. Got it.

From the crowd emerges a frumpy woman in her twenty's. She
wears glasses and an attitude. This is ELSA. She accosts
Helen.

ELSA
You riding with me--I'm going.

HELEN
Tell Mom I'll be home late.

A HULK OF A GUY approaches with an apron and tray. This is
MAX, 19, tad shady. None too bright.

MAX
Hey Julie. I brought you a shooter on
the house.

JULIE
Thanks, Max, but I have this mental
block. I can't get past the slime.

ON HELEN AND ELSA

ELSA
Is little Miss Croaker getting sauteed
tonight?

HELEN

A twit with a wit.

ELSA
Eat me.

Elsa storms off as Barry and Ray are seen coming down the
stairs towards them,

BACK ON JULIE AND MAX

MAX
Can I take you out sometime before you
leave? Like a bon voyage thing?

JULIE
I don't know, Max...

She smiles at him sweetly. She looks to Helen who rolls her
eyes.

MAX
Come on, we've been friends since
forever, you can't just leave without a
farewell, Whaddya say?

Suddenly, Barry appears, snatching the shooter off Max's
tray, proposing a toast. He's getting happy faced.

BARRY
A toast. Tous. To our last summer of
immature adolescent decadence.

Barry slams the oyster back. The other roll their cynical
eyes but the corny toast works its charm. A shared feeling.

. HELEN
Somebody's buzzed.
Max listens to all of this, not taking his eyes off Julie.
He's got a crush. Suddenly, Barry shoves him off, surprising
him, sending him reeling.

BARRY
Yo, chum bait, take a hike.

Max recovers instantly and dives for Barry. Ray intercepts,
throwing himself between the two.

RAY
Easy...easy...

JULIE
Play nice, boys.

Max is ready to pounce but he edheres to Julie's request.
Barry goes for him again. Ray holds him at bay.

JULIE
Stop it, Barr.

(CONTINUED)

HELEN
They're just friends.

RAY ;
Come on, Barr. This is tired.

Barry eases up. He realizes other people have taken notice.
He backpedals. ‘

BARRY .
Hey Ray, just taking care of your girl as
agreed. .

RAY

Thanks buddy, now let's blow.

HELEN
Yeah, let's beam down to Dawson's Beach.
Little joyride.

Helen leads Barry off as Max casts deadly eyes. Julie smiles
apologetically as they turn and leave.

9 EXT, ROAD - MINUTES LATER

A long, deserted road. The ocean sparkles in the distance
under a brightly lit moon.

The BMW makes it way, weaving from side to side. Helen,
stands, sticking out of the sun roof. She waves her scepter
into the air, performing...

HELEN

"I ama Seagull..."

MUSIC BLARES from the speakers. Barry drives recklessly,
crossing the line deliberately, LAUGHING it up.

RAY
We're evolvvvwwving. It's just beginning.

HELEN
I hate that.

BARRY
Then we make a pact, Right here and now.
No matter where we go. No matter what we
do. No matter what happens. We stick
together.

HELEN
Sounds good to me.

Ray looks to Julie, smiling.

RAY
Me too.

Barry lets out another rebellious HOLLER, speeding up,
EONKING the horn.

RAY
Slow down, Barr. You're gonna be picking
up highway trash. :

Helen giggles as Barry speeds up faster. Through the
windshield, a curve appears.

JULIE
Jesus, Reaper's Curve. SLOW DOWN!

Julie hits him in the shoulder. Barry's having e blast. He
speeds up even faster. Helen's loving it too. She sways
from side to side.

PREPARE TO DIE!

HELEN
SOAP OPERA CRASH!

Helen throws her arms up dramatically, emitting a SHRILL FAKE
SCREAM.

It swerves off the road coming to an ultra smooth stop just
Short of going over the railing and into the water below.

The dock sits below on a jetty. Headlights stream off the
edge of the cliff as a MAN'S FIGURE stares up at the road
above. From his hand, the medallion dangles in the wind.

Dead silence. Julie and Ray are frozen stifi. Barry takes a
Swig of Jim Beam, eyeing them in the mirror.

BARRY
You guys should get out more.

JULIE
You asshole.

Julie is livid.

RAY
It's okay. We're alright.

BARRY
Wno's the asshole? You got in the car
with a drunk driver. You should know
better little Miss-I-got-a-scnolarship-
for being soooo smart.

JULIE
People die on this curve all the time.

BARRY
Thus the name--Reaper's Curve.

Barry puts the car in gear, giving Helen a conspiratory wink.

She suppresses a giggle as Barry takes off down the road.
Only much saner this time. The perfect by-the-book driver.

A private beach. A secret teenage party site. “Ponight, it's
deserted. Except for Barry's shiny new BMW, parked near the
water's edge.

EXT. CAMPFIRE - LATER 14

A campfire burns and CRACKLES. The two couples cozy around
it, intertwined, listening to Ray spin a spooky tale.

Ray
..the boy and girl are making out | when
they hear on the radio that a lunatic
killer has escaped from an insane asylum
and he has a long, sharp hook for a
hand...

Barry brings the Jim Beam to his lips.

BARRY
Dude, you're telling it wrong...
RAY
Shut up. And the girl gets scared and

wants to leave and the boy, all hot and
bothered, gets pissed and peels out...

BARRY
(interrupting)
No, that's not the way it goes...see they
run out of ges and the guy goes for help
and the girl stays in the car and hears
this scratccchinggg sound on the roof...

HELEN
«no, it's nota scratching sound, it's a
arin. .drip..érip.

BARRY
No, it's scratching because the guy's
been hung from a tree limb and his feet
are scratching against the roof...

blood from his severed neck drips on the
roof. Drip..drip...

JULIE
No, no, no. He wasn't decapitated--he
was gutted with the hook. That's the way
I heard it.

RAY
Look, you're all wrong. They get to the
girl's house and they find the lunatic's
bloody hook in the car door. That's the
original story. That's the way it really
happened.

BARRY .
None of it really happened. It's a
bullshit ghost story .to begin with.

RAY

No, it's not, it's true.
HELEN

I don't think so, Ray.
RAY

Swear it.

Julie sits up.

JULIE

Please. It's a fictional story created
to warn girls of the dangers of having
premarital sex.

Ray comes right back at her.

RAY
Well, actually honey, and you know how
terrified I am of your IQ, but I have to
disagree. It's really an urban legend--
American folklore, and they all usually
originate irom some real life incident.

Silence. This makes sense. It even sounds a little creepy.

Julie eyes Ray critically. He gives her a wink.

HELEN

children....

She collapses on top of him, showering his face with kisses.
HELEN
.-and then you'll head off .to rehab and
we'll live happily blah-blah-blah...

Barry lunges up with a second wind, kissing her hard. He
rolls her over and begins to devour her.

EXT. SHORELINE - SAME : 16
Julie, alone, walks to the water's edge. The ocean is
calm...peaceful. She looks around, her eyes combing the

beach.

JULIE
Ray? Ray? Where'd you go?

She stares down at her reflection rippling in the surf when
a...

MAN'S FIGURE

appears behind her, grabbing her. She spins around,
SCREAMING, to find Ray there, one of his fingers curved into
a hook.

RAY
I'm gonna hook you! .

She LAUGHS, falling into his arms, knocking him backwards

But it's true.

JULIE
Please...the hook is merely a phallic
symbol...

RAY

*,.0h really...

JULIE

Ray WINCES. Julie kisses him again. They break. Face to
face. Her eyes penetrating his.

JULIE
God, I'm gonna miss you.

RAY
You don't have to. You can still ditch
Boston and come to New York with me.

JULIE .
We can't all sit in a village coffeehouse
and ramble esoterically on our laptops.
There's just not enough room.

~ RAY
See, nobody gets me the way you do.

JULIE
I understand your paaaain.

RAY
Precisely.

Julie holds him tight, completely serious.

JULIE

JULIE .
Cite your source.

He takes her hand and places it on his chest at his heart.

They stare at each other intensely. Julie's hand begins to
fuss with the buttons on his shirt.

JULIE
Take it off.

Ray eyes her. Surprised.

RAY
Are you sure?

She looks at him. Her eyes have never been so sure. They
melt into each other's arms.

EXT. BEACH - LATER 17

It's late. The party is over. Helen is fighting a sloppy
drunk Barry for his keys. There's no way he can drive.

HELEN
Give me the keys, man-meat, you're toast.

Barry swings the air.

BARRY
Nobody drives my car but me.

But she's too fast for him. She swipes his keys and tosses
them to Ray who nabs them. Barry turns on Ray.

BARRY
Gimme my fucking keys.

RAY
“You're trashed, pal. .
HELEN
Come ride in the back with me. I'll let
you do things to me.
Helen guides him to the car.

BARRY

Ray is frazzled.

Julie inspects the grill.

JULIE
A dog couldn't have done that.

BARRY
A fucking deer could.

Barry staggers toward Ray, ready to strike him.

RAY
You dropped your bottle, I was trying...

My dad's gonna freak on my ass.

HELEN
Come on, Barry, it was an accident.
Leave him alone. .

A MAN'S BOOT

Big and bulky. Julie kneels down and picks it up. They all
stare at it. A moment as the realization overcomes them.

JULIE
Oh God.

RAY ‘
No way.

HELEN

But I thought...

RAY
I didn't see it...

BARRY
There's no way...no...

JULIE
Oh God...this isn't happening.

Suddenly, the world begins to swirl around them.

Barry runs back to the car and pops the trunk. He withdraws
a couple of flashlights. He throws one to Ray.

~ BARRY
You take that side.

The four split up on either side of the road, combing it,
looking in the ditch and brush. Panic has set in. Helen is
near hysterical, CRYING, SOBBING almost.

BARRY
Will you get a grip?

Julie holds onto Ray as they move down the road. The
flashlight casting a single ray into the night.

JULIE
Please God, please God, please...

JULIE

Barry and Helen come running. All eyes go to it as the four
of them stand frozen, thunderstruck, staring down at the
shape in front of them. A long, agonizing silence. And
then...

RAY
I couldn't see...I swear...

JULIE
Oh God!

EELEN
Is he dead?

RAY
I don't know.

BARRY
Check his pulse.

RAY
No way, man. You do it.

BARRY
You're the one who ranmed him.

JULIE
Just do it. He could still be alive. He
needs help.

No one wants to go near it. Finally, Ray takes a step
forward, moving slowly to the body, kneeling down beside it.

The man is large before him. He wears a dark slicker. CLOSE
ON his face. It's unrecognizable. A.bloody mess. Ray finds
the man's wrist, checks his pulse, fingers shaking furiously.
The others stand back. No one wants to look.

A moment...and then Ray's face collapses. He looks to Barry.

RAY
I think he's dead.

BARRY
Shit! Fuck!

We gotta call the police. Get an
ambulance out here.

Helen wants the hell out of here. She races back to the car.

BARRY
What's the hurry? The guy's dead.
JULIE
You're not a doctor. You don't make that

decision.
Barry paces furiously.

BARRY
Use your brain, Julie. We call the
police and we're fucked.

JULIE
It was an accident.

Ray stands. His face scared.

RAY
Let's think about this a minute.

Julie goes ballistic.

JULIE
Think about what? He was crossing the
road in the middle of the night. It was
an accident. You weren't drinking...or
speeding...

Barry hits himself in the head several times, hard. Helen
goes to him, near delirious.

HELEN
We'll tell the police the truth. They'll
believe us. Won't they?

RAY
It's manslaughter at best. We're gonna
fry no matter who takes the fall.

An idea storms Barry.

BARRY
Then we leave. Right now.

: JULIE
No way. Are you crazy?

BARRY
Think about it. He's already dead.
There's nothing we can do to bring his
ass back.

JULIE
We can't leave him here.

BARRY, .
Tell me, little Miss Pre-law. What's the
charge for manslaughter?

JULIE
You're not thinking clearly. You're
drunk.

Helen steps forward tentatively.

HELEN
Barr's right, Julie, no one's seen us.
We could leave right now. "

Julie tries to reason with them...to put an end to this
insanity.

JULIE
What about the evidence?

Ray's at the front of the car, checking it out. Hysteria
abounds .

RAY
The grill's busted. There's blood
everywhere.

BARRY
We can clean it up.

JULIE
Listen to yourselves. We're going to the
police. .

BARRY .
We don't have time for your shit. Wwe
gotta move fast.

RAY
Let's try to stay calm. Focus.

JULIE :
Don't you get it? If there's some of him
on the car, there's some of the car on
him, they'll trace it back to you.
You're looking at hit and run.

BARRY
Then we dump the body.

Barry is raging. Julie's face drops in shock, nearly
laughing.

JULIE
You've lost it.

Helen pipes in, her face tear-streaked.

HELEN
Let's just pretend we were never here.

BARRY
We could drag him to the water and dump
him in. They wouldn't find him for
weeks. By that time all the evidence
will be washed away.

RAY
If they found him at all. The currents

Julie stares Ray down, disgusted he's even considering this.

JULIE .
I won't be any part of it.

Helen moves to the car. Ray approaches Julie. His voice
soft and serious.

RAY
I'm scared, Julie. I'm not like the rest
of you. I don't have the family or money
to pull me out of this. Please...

Barry stands over the body. His flashlight casting an eerie
glow on him.

BARRY
This is your future, Julie, think about
it. College, your scholarship... He's
already dead. If we go to the police--
we're dead too.

This gives Julie pause. He's gotten to her. Suddenly, in
the distance...

EXT. ROAD - HEADLIGHTS APPEAR 21°
BARRY
FUCK!
HELEN

What do we do?

BARRY
Ray, give me a hand.

Barry and Ray, like teamwork, grab the body and drag it
completely off the road. The headlights come closer. Julie
squints to see an old pick-up making its way to them.

They get the body to the side of the road...Barry kneels down
in front of it, pushing it into the ditch.

HELEN /
Shit. They're slowing down. Who is it?

The truck is nearly on them. Julie recognizes the driver.

BARRY
Jesus, fuck. Get rid of him.

The truck pulls along side of them. Julie moves out to meet
it. Her face deliberating, calculating. The moment of
truth.

Max sticks his head out the window. Always happy to see her.

MAX
Hey, Julie. Whatsa matter? Car trouble?

Julie looks down, she still holds the boot in her hand. she
slides it behind her back.

JULIE
Actually...

Julie looks back to Ray. His eyes plead with her.

JULIE
It's Barry. He's had too much to drink
and we're trying to keep the upchuck
outta the new car...

Max looks to the ditch. Barry, on cue, bends over, RETCHING.
Max eyes the BMW. He sees the dented grill.

MAX
Guess it's not so new anymore.

Julie tries to remain calm.

JULIE
"Don't drink and drive."

MAX
(with asshole sarcasm)
Daddy's gonna be mad.

RAY
What can I do for you, Max?

Ray steps in, blocking the view of the car.

He takes one last look around. Barry in the ditch. Helen
leaning over him. Julie, her face nervous.

Max shakes his head, disgusted with them. He hits the gas,
taking off.

His truck disappears down the road.
EXT. WATER'S EDGE - MINUTES LATER 22

Ray and Barry drag the man's body through the brush. Helen
leads the way with a flashlight while Julie picks up the
rear. She holds her own flashlight, keeping her distance.

BARRY

Even if his rody washes ashore in the
next coupla weeks, it'll be eaten by
crabs and small fish...maybe we'll get
lucky with a shark.

They move quickly...efficiently. Fueled by fear.

The dock from before. Water CRASHES against it as the four
appear with the body in tow.

BARRY
Okay, put him down.

They maneuver his body just so.

RAY

Easy. That's it.

The body comes to rest at the dock's edge. Julie notices a
marking on the man's forearm. A TATOO. THE FACE OF A YOUNG

BARRY
Why?

JULIE
I don't know. Just to know.

HELEN
I don't wanna know.

_ BARRY
Let's just pretend he's some escaped

lunatic with a hook for a hand end we're .
doing everybody a favor. Where's his

boot?

Julie holds it up. Barry grabs it, then leans down to the
man's foot. He quickly, decisively slides it on. Silence.
Barry wipes the sweat from his brow.

BARRY
Okay. Help me, Ray.

Julie grabs his arm, holding him back. He looks at Julie.

RAY
I don't think I can, Barry.

Helen SCREAMS as the man lifts up, his face bloody raw...he's
alive--barely.

Helen fights him off as the man slowly rolls further over the
side.

Barry tries to pry the hand loose. Ray jumps. down to help.
The man has Helen by her hair...ripping it from her scalp.

HELEN
GET HIM OFF ME!

The man goes over the side, taking Helen with him. Suddenly,
Julie swipes at the man's bloody head with her flashlig!
Direct and hard. The man releases Helen who falls back into
Ray and Barry.

 

Julie shines the flashlight down at the water to see the
man's torso slowly sink below the surface. His arm
outstretched, sticking up, the last part of his body to
submerge.

They all look down to see his hand disappear below the
water's surface, holding...clutching in its grasp...

HELEN'S SHINY, DIAMOND TIARA.

BARRY
NOOOOOO.....

Barry lunges for it. But it's useless.

RAY
Shit, we're screwed.

BARRY
Fuck that! Gimme the flashlight.

In a split second, Barry dives in.

Murky and dark. A small shaft of light from the flashlight

as blood seeps upward from the gash in his head, creating a
blurry trail.

Barry reaches for the tiara and pries it loose, when
suddenly...

THE MAN'S EYES OPEN...

Barry freaks, roaring backwards. Tiara in hand, he bolts
upward to the surface when...

HE'S YANKED BACK DOWN...

Barry, out of air, kicks madly, looking down to see his legs
caught up...entangled in...

KELP. Large strands of it knotted around his legs, holding
him down. He rustles with it, panicked, his breath gone.
His nose begins to bleed...finally, he frees
himself...blasting to the surface.

up coming face to face with Ray. His face pained.

RAY
It'll be okay. It'll be okay...

She slides away from him. She knows better.
EXT. ROAD - SAME

The car drives off into the night. Hanging on a shrub in the
ditch by the side of the road, a small object, a trinket of
sorts, illuminated in the fading tail lights. A tiny medal

INT. DORM ROOM - MORNING

A typical girl's dorm room. Drab walls, industrial strength
furniture. A suitcase sits on the edge of the bed, packed
and ready.

At a desk, against the wall, sits a GIRL at her computer.
Back to, she appears frail and thin. Her hands rest on the
keypad, unmoving.

DEB

Yo, time to go.

This stirs the girl from her trance. She turns toward the
CAMERA to reveal a face that, to put it mildly, has seen
better days. Sunken eyes, pale skin, stringy-hair...it takes
a moment to register. This is Julie.

Deb sits behind the wheel. Her head bops to the MUSIC that
BLARES from speakers. Far too energized.

Julie sits in the passenger side, leaning against the window,
her face pressed against the glass. Somber.

Almost there. Just a few more miles.

They move around a sharp curve.. vin the distance, the
familiar old dock is seen jetting out over the water.

A nice house. Simple and subdued. The front door opens and
Julie enters with her bag.

MRS. JAMES

Is that you, Julie?

Julie winces at her mother's voice. The kitchen door BURSTS
open and Julie's mother, MRS. JAMES, appears. Mid-forties
and well preserved. Smart and youthful. She's genuinely
excited to see her daughter.

But her excited face falls the instant she lays eyes on the
barely recognizable Julie. A woman of grace, Mrs. James
recovers brilliantly.

. MRS. JAMES
Welcome home, dear.

She grabs Julie, hugging her hard, holding back tears.

MRS. JAMES
I've missed you.

Julie squeezes her mother back, relaxing for a moment, in the
comfort and safety of her arms.

INT. DINING ROOM - LATER 33

Julie and her mom sit at the dinner table. Julie eats
quietly while her mom rambles on nervously.

MRS. JAMES
How's the snapper? I wanted monk but
it's been a bad season. Fishing isn't
what it used to be. Are you on drugs?
Julie swallows.

_ INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME 34

Julie moves to a bookshelf. It looks like a shrine to Julie.
Framed pictures, newspaper clippings, trophies, and other
items that illustrate what an over-achieving, scholarship-
winning, all-around perfect girl Julie once was.

One picture, in particular, leaps out at Julie. Ker with her
arms wrapped tight around an older man with a kind face. Her
father. Julie shuts her eyes.

 

Mrs. James appears from the kitchen. She holds an envelope
in her hand. She lays it on the coffee table.

 

MRS. JAMES
You have some mail. A letter came today.
No report card, though. That came last
week.

Uh-oh. Julie turns to her, immediately on the defense.

JULIE
Look, mom. I know it looks bad but the
summer session went really well...

MRS. JAMES
It would have to, dear, because according
to the Dean of Boston University you have
only one more chance.

JULIE .
It's not that serious, really...

MRS. JAMES

away, you don't call or visit...

Julie nods again. Mrs. James returns to the kitchen, leaving
Julie alone. She eyes.the letter on the table, picks it up.

CLOSE ON THE LETTER. There's no return address. Julie opens
it, pulls out a single sheet of paper, unfolds it, reads
it...and almost loses her dinner. Her knees buckle, her legs
give way, she grabs the table for support. Her face
horrified. .

CLOSE ON THE LETTER. Hand-lettered, scribbled in stark black
ink are the words...

I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST. SUMMER

Fear races across Julie's face. Her eyes swell up with
tears. Her mother reappears in the doorway.

MRS. JAMES
Is everything alright?

JULIE
‘Do you know who delivered this? There's
no postmark or return address.

MRS. JAMES
Your guess is as good as mine. Why?
Wnat does it say?

calm in her mother's presence. Mrs. James just-shakes her
head in silent worry.

A girl's room. Bright and pinkish. Everything is a reminder
of the old Julie.

Julie lies on the bed beating her head rhythmically into her
pillow. Tne letter lies in front of her.

Julie checks the latch on the window, securing it, then pulls
the curtains closed.

EXT. JULIE'S HOUSE - MORNING

Julie emerges from the front door. Morning has come but the
summer sun is noticably absent. A dark and gray day is in
store. Nevertheless, Julie dons sunglasses.as she hops into
her car, starts it up, and heads down the street.

EXT. SHIVERS' DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY

Julie's car comes to a stop in front of a huge old-timey all-
Purpose department store that sits in the middle of town
square. She emerges from the car and heads for the
store...checking her back several times as she goes.

INT. BACK ROOM - SECONDS LATER

A back store room filled with equipment and inventory. TWO
GUYS are busy at work loading up an elevator--an ancient hand-
turned kind. They're being ordered about by Elsa. She
appears a year older and still a bitch.

ELSA
Guys, guys--easy. It's called glass. it

Her two tortured employees pull the rope pulley as the
elevator disappears to the second floor as Elsa moves out a
door into...

Elsa moves through the store, passing e make-up counter and a
SALES CLERK, bent over, busy at work. She looks toward the
front of the door to see Julie, waving at her. Elsa crosses
to her. No smile, completely expressionless.

ELSA |
Well, well, look what the cat drug in.

her, I suggest you try women's fragrances

ten feet to your left.

Elsa turns and points, thoroughly enjoying Julie's surprise.
Julie looks to the fragrance counter, her eyes shocked to

find...

- Helen, the sales clerk, standing behind the counter,
adjusting a perfume display, her hands moving quickly,
nervously. CLOSE ON her face. Her once classic looks now
seem harsh and stark under her mask of heavy make-up.

This is a different Helen. Except for the hair. It's as big
and luscious as ever. It hangs so thick and full around her

face, she appears to be hiding in it.

ELSA
Frightening, isn't it?

nm looks up and spots Julie, and for the first time, in

Hele
probably a long time, smiles.

HELEN
dulie! Oh my God!

Elsa takes off, leaving Julie and Helen alone.

An awkward

moment as Julie moves closer. Helen's hands tremble.

HELEN
Wnen did you get home?
JULIE

HELEN

It's good to see you. I missed...

eventually...maybe...

Julie understands all too well. But she refuses to respond
emotionally. Instead she pulls the letter from her jacket
and hands it to Helen.

JULIE |
Someone sent this to me.

- Helen takes the letter, opens it up. Reads it.

HELEN
Oh my God!

Helen freaks. Her face goes manic.

JULIE
Somebody knows, Helen.
HELEN
But how?
JULIE

I don't know.

Helen takes a few deep breaths, looking around, making sure
they can't be heard. From across the way, Elsa busies
herself, as if she's not paying attention.

HELEN
We were so careful...

JULIE

if someone else was there that night?

What about Ray? Have you showed this
letter to him? What does he think?

I haven't seen Ray since last summer. We
broke up. Last-I heard he was up north
working.

Barry's getting really annoyed by all. of this.

BARRY
Okay, let's suppose somebody else was
there that night. Why send a letter one
year later? It's probably just a crack
fucking around.

Then it dawns on them at the same time. Barry and Julie's

FISHERMAN and WORKERS go about their day. Max is loading
crates of crabs onto a dolly when he spots Barry.

MAX
Go figure. I was just saying to myself.
What's up with Barry Cox?

Max follows.

Barry RAGES, throwing his weight against Max, holding him
down. Grabbing a hook from the wall, he forces it against
Max's face.

Max stumbles to his feet. He grabs the hook off the floor,
swinging it through the air angrily.

MAX
Motherfucker...

He stumbles out of the ice cooler. Barry is gone. The place
is empty. SSSSHHHH! A soft, high pitched sound envelopes
the room. A WHISTLING. Max:looks around, unnerved.

MAX
(to nobody)
Don't test me, motherfucker. I'll call
the police on your college quarterback
ass. :

A SOUND from behind causes Max to spin around. Standing in
the doorway that leads to the dock is...

A FISHERMAN...

silhouetted against the light. His hooded slicker pulled
down, hiding his face. A familiar medallion dangles from his
hand. Max eases up, recognizing him.

MAX
Jesus, man. You scared the shit out of
me.

Max has had it for one day. He stabs the fish hook into a
nearby wooden beam as the fisherman steps into the ice house.

EXT. BOARDWALK - SAME a4

The crowded boardwalk. Julie and Helen try to keep up with
Barry's hurried pace.

JULIE

Julie appears the skeptic when a tall, towering FIGURE
appears behind her.

BARRY
Well, I'll be damned...

Julie spins around to find Ray standing behind her. He wears
a green fisherman's slicker. His face appears older,
rougher. His demeanor is quiet, eyes intense. The
transition from boy to man has been made. His appearance
almost takes her breath eway.

JULIE
Ray?

RAY
Hi...

JULIE

I didn't know you were back in town.

RAY
Just docked for a few days.

An awkward silence. They're all four together again. No one
knows what to say. Finally...

BARRY
So Ray grew up to be a fisherman, huh?
RAY
Almost a year now. I work .on that blue
one over there.

Julie only half-looks at the big trawler he points at in the
harbor. Ray's presence has unnerved her.

BARRY
That's nice. I'm outta here, guys. Have
a nice life.

Barry shoves off. He's not interested in any reunion. Ray
looks to Julie, timidly.

Julie takes the letter from him and folds it up as if to
leave.

RAY : .

could get together. ..maybe?

Ray smiles at her, nervously, trying hard to make some
contact with her.

JULIE
I don't think so, Ray.

Julie starts to leave. Ray blocks her path. His face
tortured,

RAY

know you hold me responsible for what
happened.

She eyes him, unflinching.

JULIE
I don't hold you responsible. I'm
responsible for my own actions. I don't

With that said, she pushes by him, marching off into the

the gym is deserted. Barry, now in workout clothes, is at
the bench press, in the middle of a set. He pumps it
out...in a mad rage almost. A release for his anger.

INT. LOCKER ROOM - LATER

Barry stands at an open locker, his letterman jacket hangs
prominently inside with his other things. A sweaty Barry

place seems completely empty. He lets it go.

Barry stands nude under the shower. Steam rising around him.
Suddenly, a shadow moves along the wall. Barry sees it,
turns quickly...

Barry walks to his locker drying himself with a towel. He
looks to his locker to find...

A small picture shoved in its door. A Polaroid. He rips it
off, curious.

CLOSE ON the picture. It's a snapshot of his BMW, parked in
the gym parking lot. He turns it over, scribbled on the beck

deep into the dock area, leading...luring Barry.

Barry is directly in front of the car, wnen he hears the
gears shift. In.a split second, the car accelerates forward,
right at him.

Barry bolts, moving around a fishboat that sits up on a dry
dock. He slips through the pilings, just missing being
RAMMED into the boat.

Feet pounding, Barry charges for the boardwalk, trying
desperately to outrun the car as it speeds towards him. He
crosses over to the boardwalk, but the BMW doesn't flinch.
It torpedoes towards him.

Barry comes to a dead end, Crab pots stacked in front of an
old billboard. He looks about, sizing up his options. The
BMW hits the brakes, reverses and spins the car around
sharply so that it faces Barry head on. Barry's trapped.
The car IDLES, as if egging him on, daring him to make a run
for it.

Barry tries to make out who's driving. But it's too dark,
all he can see is a SHAPE. The car REVS. Barry, scared
shitless, must make a decision. He makes a run for it, but
the car has him. It hits the gas, PLOWING into him, sending
him CRASEING through the the crab pots, into the
billboard...through it..and onto the boardwalk beyond.

 

 

EXT. BOARDWALK ~ SAME

Barry lay still on the boardwalk. Shattered glass
everywhere. His body unmoving.

CLOSE ON Barry's face. Terrified but somehow conscious. A
piece of glass stuck in the cheek below his left eve. He
squirms, wiggles, tries to free himself but it's useless.
His legs are trapped by the grill of the car.

Barry, near tears, lifts himself up, looking towards the car.
He tries to get up but fails, collapsing, falling face down
onto the boardwalk.

Suddenly, he hears the car door SQUEAK OPEN. Two boots hit
the ground moving towards him. The tough as nails Barry is
reduced to tears. He SCREAMS BLOODY MURDER!

What do you want? Please...please...

The figure reaches down towards him slowly...in no hurry.
Barry cranks his head to look up at the figure but headlights
blind him.

BARRY
I'm sorry....We didn't mean it...

The FIGURE is upon him, quickly...swiftly, grabbing him by
the hair, wrenching his head back. The last image Barry sees
is that of shattered glass and the reflection of a figure
magnified many times over. His face hidden by a slicker.

BLACKOUT!
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - MORNING 54

Barry lies in a hospital bed. Alive. Heavily bandaged with
a large cast on his arm. He's sleeping more peacefully than
he has a right to.

Barry's mother, stern and proper, is nearby, along with her
HUSBAND, an older version of Barry. They listen to a YOUNG
DOCTOR explain his condition. The doctor speaks in a
whisper.

DOCTOR
He apparently tried to kill himself. The
police pulled him from his car. He
rammed it head-on into a store front.
His right arm was shattered in seven
places.

MR. COX
Christ! Is there anything you can do.
That's his throwing arm....

On the wall, are a series of framed pictures. An assortment
of old family photos. A mother, father, two kids. All
smiling in happier times. This disturbs Julie deeply.

HELEN

I was with Julie.
Her mom's instantly happy to hear this.
MOM

Oh hon, how is she? I'm so glad you two

Yeah...well...

INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME 66

Helen's father holds the remote. He channel surfs, when
behind him, the front door opens and a FIGURE steps into the
house.

It's the FISHERMAN. He enters smoothly, simply. He stands

in the foyer, his face hidden in the hood of his dark

slicker. Silent. Ominous,

Helen grabs a soda from the fridge.

HELEN
I'm really tired. I'm going to bed.

The FISHERMAN closes the front door, then turns and moves up
the staircase disappearing just as Helen enters the foyer and
heads up the stairs behind him. Unaware.

INT. UPSTAIRS LANDING - SAME

The FISHERMAN moves effortlessly, gliding around the railing
and down the hall. He disappears into a darkened doorway
just as Helen reaches the top of the stairs. She just misses
him.

Helen moves to the darkened doorway and reaches inside with
her hand and CLICKS on the overhead light to reveal...

INT. BEDROOM - SAME

Helen's room. It still has the personality of a high school
beauty queen. It seems & bit sad now given Helen's current
state. The FISHERMAN is nowhere to be seen...but there is an
open closet door...

Helen starts to rip off her clothes...she moves to the closet
when a shiny glimmer catches her eye. She goes to her
dresser where her Croaker Queen Tiara rests, showcased, on
her jewelry box. She picks it up and places it on her head.

Helen stares at herself a moment...the memories...she yanks
it off and throws it to the dresser when she sees, reflected
in the mirror, a FIGURE, standing behind her...she SCREAMS
MADLY, whipping around to find...

Elsa, her sister, standing in the open doorway, her nose
upturned.

ELSA
Is the washed-up, dried-out, has-been
having a moment?

HELEN
What do you want?

Helen moves to the closet and reaches. in for her nightshirt.
Her arm stretching deep inside the closet.

ELSA

Helen pulls her nightshirt over her head.

HELEN

The outgoing queen has to ride in the
parade prior to the pageant. It's
tradition. There's nothing I can do
about it.

Helen grabs her hairbrush and begins the nightly ritual of
brushing her hair. Elsa eyeballs her with disgust.

ELSA
You and your hair...pathetic.

HELEN
You could leave now.

ELSA
So very, very pathetic.

Elsa takes off, shutting the door behind her. Helen
grimaces, grabbing a bottle of pills from the night stand.
She pops two, washing them down with diet soda not noticing
the clothes that slightly sway just inside the closet.

She pulls the covers back and crawls into bed. She turns the
light out and lies there...her face troubled by all that's
happened. Helen tries to sleep.

EXT. DOCK - MORNING - ESTABLISHING 71"

The morning fog rises over the water. Cloudy and overcast.
Helen's house sits on shore in the distance.

INT. HELEN'S BEDROOM - SAME _ 72

EXTREMELY CLOSE ON Helen's face. Asleep. Slowly, her eyes
flutter open, blinking, adjusting to the morning light. She
rolls over and her diamond tiara slides down from her head
into her face. She grabs it, confused. How did that get
there? She sits up as the CAMERA WIDENS to reveal all of
Helen's hair...

HAS BEEN CUT OFF

closely cropped to the scalp. Helen senses it immediately,

across her face as she stumbles to the mirror.

Helen stops cold in her tracks. Before her, on the mirror,
written in lipstick, are the words...

SOON

Helen sees her reflection through the red streaked words as a
SCREAM erupts from her gut. It ECHOES through the house.

Helen grabs at her hair, horrified at the FISHERMAN'S
handiwork. She can't stop SCREAMING...FEET are heard moving
down the hall towards her...

MOM
(off camera)
Helen...what's wrong dear?

ELSA
JESUS CHRIST!

Helen hears the door opening...she looks at the words on the
mirror, and in a split second, takes her hand and SMASHES it
into the mirror...it SHATTERS to a million pieces taking the
words away before they can be seen.

Helen's mom and Elsa appear to find Helen clutching a
bleeding hand...her appearance shocks them.

MOM
Dear God, what happened?

Helen stands, shaking uncontrollably, a BLUBBERING mess. Her
mom moves to her, putting her arms around her.

MOM
What happened?

Her mother is horrified. Elsa, merely indifferent.

HELEN

Helen, hysterical, has no idea what to say. Finally...

wrong? Is it the parade? You don't

HELEN
I'm sorry, mom. I'm so sorry.

Helen is reduced to an infant.
MOM’
Why are you sorry, hon? What's there to
be sorry for?
Helen catches herself. She holds back the truth.

HELEN
I'm sorry I cut my hair.

She lies. Her tears make it convincing. Her mom just nods,
knowingly. Elsa watches on, a snicker on her face.

ELSA
She's lost it...

Mom cuts Elsa a deadly stare but she knows there's some truth
to it. Helen is not the daughter she once was.

MOM
Elsa hon, go into my bathroom and bring
me an anti-depressant.

Elsa disappears. Mom just holds. her SO3BING daughter,
rocking her gently back and forth.

radio is on...

RADIO DJ

Button up, folks, it's gonna be a cold

Julie clicks it off. Way tense.

SCRFFFFF! The slightest noise. Julie listens, convinced she
heard something.

SCRAAAATCH! She did hear something. Behind her. She checks
out the backseat through the rearview mirror. Nothing.

SCRFFFFF! The noise is a slight scurrying sound. Confusing.
She holds the wheel steady, throwing one arm over the seat
feeling into the backseat with her hand.

SCRARATCH! It's louder this time.

JULIE
What the...

Julie turns the corner and pulls over on the side of the
road. She turns behind her and looks over the seat. It's
completely empty. SCRRRFFF! What the... It sounds like
tiny feet scurrying about within the car.

crawling with live sea crabs. Julie SHRIEKS, stumbling back,
horrified. The crabs...small ones, large ones move about his
ravaged body, claws out, nipping, pinching at it. Feeding.

The sight sickens her. She looks away but not before seeing
that his torso is wrapped in a letterman jacket. Stiched in
the upper chest is the name BARRY.

She nearly collapses when a crab, dangling from the roof of
the trunk, falls down onto her. Julie freaks, brushing it
off, just as...

A HORN HONKS

Julie spins around to find a car passing by her. Julie
reacts quickly, instinctively. She SLAMS the trunk lid
closed, then looks around to see if she's being watched. No
sign of anyone. She turns and bolts down the street, away
from her car.

approach the car.

BARRY
You sure he was dead?

Barry tries to lead her down the street.

Barry doesn't wait for an answer. He lunges for Ray,
SMASHING into him...they tumble to the ground.

Julie jumps on top of them, to intercede. She grabs Barry's
arm, the one in the cast, he WELCHES in pain.

JULIE
Stop it. Now.

Helen helps her separate the two, but not before Barry gets
one good blow to Ray's jaw. He draws blood.

Despite a drab and overcast day,- the Croaker Festival is in
full swing. Tourists and townspeople flock the boardwalk
where all sorts of booths have been set up. Arts and crafts,
bake sales, etc.

Main street has been roped off and people have already
started gathering, waiting for the parade.

EXT. SIDE STREET - SAME 83

On a side street, the parade lines up. Hometown floats of
giant fish and shrimp and other sea life are pulled by
decorated cars and trucks. The local high school band WARMS
UP.

Helen leans against a float of huge colorful seashells.
She's barely recognizable. Her hair has been slicked back,
make-up applied, her tiara in place. She looks striking,
sexy even. Barry stands next to her.

BARRY
I'm going to ride up in the truck.
Signal if you see anything.

HELEN
I've never seen him. How will I...

You'll know.

The skies are dark and overcast. But it doesn't keep away
the crowds that line the street as the Croaker Festival
parade is under way. The high school band marches in front
followed by float after float--all in some nautical theme.

Finally, Helen's float rides by. She sits in a seashell
throne with her tiara and scepter. She waves to the crowd.

CLOSE ON her face...tight, nervous.

Barry rides in the truck up front. He turns to her and
smiles. This brings her a small measure of comfort. She
looks out to the crowd, waving...her hand tiring, suddenly
the...

FISHERMAN APPEARS...standing behind a MOTHER and CHILD. The
Fisherman wears the slicker's hood over his head, shielding
his face from being seen.

Helen's heart starts POUNDING. She waves frantically at
Barry whose head is turned away from her.

Fisherman walking away, towards the boardwalk. He moves on
him, coming upon him, PLOWING into him. The Fisherman goes
down...his hood comes off to reveal...

AN OLD MAN, thin and fragile...definitely not a threat to

Barry backs off immediately, realizing he's made a mistake.

carcass hangs, tied upside, from a nearby tree.

Julie moves to the back door. She KNOCKS on it. Waits. No
answer. ~

Julie is determined. She wastes no time. She tries the
door. It's locked. She moves toward the screen kitchen
door. Looks through into the kitchen not seeing the FIGURE

The parade takes a turn onto another street where a whole new
crowd of SPECTATORS awaits. Helen loses sight of the
Fisherman and Barry. She continues to wave, going through
the motions, very frightened when suddenly she sees the...

Fisherman, standing up ahead, in the crowd. She does a
double-take but then on the other side of the street she sees
the Fisherman...wait a minute...but then she sees another.

The float passes by the Fisherman, he removes the hood from
his head...his face, young and sweet...he picks e CHILD up
and places him on his shoulders for a better view. Father
and son.

Helen turns to the other Fisherman, his face is also in
view...an older man, graying. She looks up and down the
street, local Fisherman are everywhere.

This calms her a bit, realizing this is a normal sight ina
fishing town. She takes a deep calming breath and exhales
but then sees...

ANOTHER FISHERMAN.

This one stands alone with the hood over his head. He stands
right on the street's edge...as close as you can get to the
floats. She passes by him, waving, smiling. He pulls his
hand from his coat pocket to reveal a large, shiny curved
object.

Helen looks at it closely. It's a fish hook. Sharp and
deadly. It disappears back in his coat pocket. A very
deliberate move. He was showing it to her. Flaunting it.

 

The float breezes right by him, Helen sits rigid in her seat,
scared to move. She scans the crowd for Barry...sees him

stored items.

Missy is busy at work, skinning a raccoon. She is fast and
focused with the knife in her hend.

Julie sits across from her, on a box, the open yearbook in
her lap.

JULIE
I need to find your brother's friend,
Billy Blue. I need to talk to him. I
was hoping you could look through this
book...

MISSY
Why? What's all this about?

Missy is very suspicious. Julie is at a loss. She doesn't
know what to say.

JULIE
It's too crazy to explain but it has to
do with your brother and last July 4th.

MISSY
What about it?

Julie is unraveling. How much should she tell? She debates
a second. Then, ah fuck it...

JULIE

What happened to your brother wasn't an
accident. There's more to it than that.

Everybody blamed him for Susie's death.
He blamed himself.

This throws Julie. She's disbelieving.

JULIE
But how do you know it was a suicide?

MISSY
He left a suicide note...

Missy moves toward the shed to an old wooden box.

She opens

it, sifts through it, withdrawing a crumpled piece of paper.

MISSY
I had to keep it hidden. His insurance
policy wouldn't pay if it was a suicide.
Don't guess it matters anymore. The
money's been spent.

She hands the letter to Julie. CLOSE ON the letter.

Scrawled in very familiar writing are the words...

I WILL NEVER FORGET LAST SUMMER

Julie inspects the letter carefully. She has seen this

handwriting before.

JULIE
This isn't a suicide note.. This is a
death threat.

MISSY
What are you talking about?

Julie begins to piece it together.

Julie is frantic, She's frightening Missy.
MISSY :

A realization overcomes Julie.

She shoves a mannequin against it, trying to shatter the
window, not seeing ‘behind her, as a mannequin, wearing a

Tilly. He's a fisherman.

support, her eyes glancing the side of the boat where the
name is’ painted in bright blue colors. It reads...

BILLY BOY.

Julie stops. Frozen. She looks to Ray, jerking away from
him, stumbling back onto the dock. A terrifying realization
creeps across her face.

off down the dock. Ray leaps over the side of the boat and
onto the dock right behind her.

Julie? Wait...

Julie's not listening. She reaches the marina's gated
entrance way. The metal door is now closed. She pulls on

Julie turns to see a FISHERMAN coming at her. Relief claims
her face. She races to him.

JULIE

The Fisherman takes her in his arms. Eis face is hidden in
the hood of the slicker he wears. Julie can make out the
lines of his jaw but little else. When he speaks, his words

_are calm and soothing.

The Fisherman stands nonplussed. He holds something in his
hand. A silver medal medallion. He flicks it and it begins
to spin...the familiar WHISTLE.

tracking their lives. Julie steps back in terrified awe.

JULIE

Ben Tilly...

FISHERMAN
Good, I see you've been doing your
homework too.

The Fisherman steps into the light. His face is seen clearly
for the first time. It is soured and weathered, with a huge
fleshy scar that extends from his forehead down to his chin.
A remnant of last summer.

Julie bolts for the door. Tilly cuts her off. She backs up,

Tilly is still in the wheelhouse. But he's moving towards

and lifts the lid off it revealing a steel metal grate. She
pulls it back and slides down inside the hole.

She drops a coupla rungs, closing the grate above her,

beside her, putting the winch into action.

In one massive blow, Tilly sends Ray flying overboerd.
From the hatch, Julie SCREAMS.

JULIE
NOOOOO....

Tilly turns to her as Ray plummets into the nets that are
being lowered into the water. He grabs at them, trying to
stay above water.

INT. BELOW DECK - SAME

Julie scrambles back down the ladder.

EXT. WATER - IN THE WATER

Ray, tangled up in the nets, is being dragged along side the
boat. The water RUSHING him...overpowering him.

INT. BELOW DECK - SAME

Julie races back to the other end of the engine room. She
pulls the oil drum away from the door. Julie rushes through
the doorway.

EXT.WATER

Ray, with every ounce of strength in him, begins to climb the
nets.

INT. DOWN BELOW

Julie starts for the ladder, looking up at the bow gate as
Tilly's shadow appears. Julie spins around and heads back
into the...

INT. ENGINE ROOM

She shuts it, latching it as she goes. She moves back to the
other ladder, climbs up it, pushing on the hatch only to find
it won't open.

EXT. MAIN DECK ~ ABOVE DECK

Tilly has weighted the hatch lid dom with heavy equipment.
Julie is trapped.

INT. BELOW DECK - SAME

Julie looks back to the engine room door. The latch is being
pried open from the other side. By Tilly. Julie scurries
down the ladder. She looks around for any escape.

Behind the ladder is a small watertight door. Old and
rusted. Julie moves for it. :

EXT, MAIN DECK - T

Ray is fighting the crashing waters, crawling up the nets.
He manages to emerge from the water and grab hold of the
boom.

INT. BELOW DECK - SAME

Julie struggles with the rusted door. Behind her, the door
is giving way as Tilly continues to disengage the latch. She
uses everything she has...the door CREAKS open and Julie
crawls through, pulling the door closed behind her. .

INT. BULKHEAD - SAME

Julie finds herself in a small, dark compartment. No way
out. Except for a tiny little door on the other side. Julie
pulls on it, yanking it open as ice pours into the bulkhead.

It falls down all around her. She looks into the small
opening. The ice hole is beyond. Julie wastes no time. She
bends down and squeezes her body through.

INT. ICE HOLE - SAME

Ice forever. Julie climbs up a hill of ice cubes. She can
barely get her footing...two steps forward, one step back...

EXT. DECK - SAME

Ray hangs from the boom, out over the water, trying to crawl
back towards the boat. .

INT. ICE HOLE - SAME

Julie looks down to see a SHADOW appear through the small
opening below. She kicks at the ice, sending mounds of it
down, filling in the small door.

Julie crawls up to the top of it and surveys her
surroundings.

The ice hole is a dark space...cold and damp. A small bulb
hangs on a:cord overhead, lighting the center of the hole.

CONTINUED:

The space is divided into three bins sealed with wooden slats
which hold packed ice. She pulls on several slats which send
ice pouring down, completely covering the hole.

The ice continues sliding down...Julie holds onto the bin's
support as the ice moves around her. Suddenly a body comes
sliding down on top of her. It's Helen.

Her eyes open wide. Her face, pale and lifeless. Her skin
as cold as death.

Julie SCREAMS, reeling backwards, slipping on the icy
surface...she grabs hold of a wooden slat for support but it
gives way...opening up a compartment of ice that comes
CRASHING DOWN on top of her...she loses her balance, tumbling
to the floor. .

Gallons and gallons of ice come pouring out of the bin,
covering her. Julie shields herself, looking up to see the
dead body of Barry, sliding down at her. Julie SCREAMS as
Barry's body crashes down on top of her.

Julie is face to face with Barry, sandwiched between her two
friends. She fights and struggles, CRYING OUT.

She frees herself, sliding away from the bodies. She bursts
into HYSTERICS, curled on the cold floor, WAILING...beyond
fright.

EXT. DECK - SAME

Ray is back on deck. He hears Julie's SCREAMS and looks down
to the ice hole hatch. He moves for it when he sees Tilly's

SHADOW appear around the side of the cabin.

Ray is against the outrigger that juts up over the deck. Ray
grabs hold and climbs up and onto the cabin's roof. He
watches as Tilly moves to the ice hatch.

INT. ICE HOLE - SAME

Julie searches for a weapon. She finds a rigging pin lodged
in the Wet room. She pulls out the pin...the nets fall away
revealing Max and Elsa...their bodies distorted and lifeless.
Julie lets out a SCREAM.

Tilly is at the hatch. He rips the lid off.

EXT. CABIN ROOF

Ray searches for a weapon. He eyes a set of ropes hanging
from the outrigger. One with e large pulley and hook at the
end. He reaches for it. :

INT. ICE HOLE - SAME

The hatch lid flies open. Julie looks up to see Tilly
staring down.

EXT. CABIN ROOF

Ray throws the hook. It goes flying...zooming at Tilly
catching him squarely in the head. He reels over, his body
sprawling across the deck.

Ray acts fast, he grabs a line and slides down it, causing
the fishnets to start to rise.

Ray races to the hatch, peering in.

RAY
Julie...hurry.

He reaches for her as she climbs the ladder. He helps her
out and onto the deck just as...

TILLY APPEARS BEHIND THEM

Jule SCREAMS...Ray spins around just as the back side of the
hook makes contact with Ray's head. Ray goes down, hurt.

Tilly turns to Julie, grabbing her, throwing her against the
outrigger base. His face angered...crazed.

BEN TILLY
Happy 4th of July, Julie.

JULIE
Please...it was an accident.

BEN TILLY
I know all about accidents, Julie. And
let me give you some advice--when you
leave a man for dead. Make sure he's
really dead.
Tilly rears back his hook...

as he pulls his pained body upright. He eyes Tilly as he ~
readies to strike. He watches as the hook gets caught up in
the swinging lines that move across the deck.

Ray eyes the winch. He lunges for the control _
handle...hitting it...sending the winch into motion.

In a split second, the ropes SNAP up, flying up to the top of
the boom, pulling, yanking Ben Tilly with it. His whole hody
is jerked upward as he's carried to the boom.

CLOSE ON Tilly's hand as it leads his body to the top of the
boom, heading right for the pulley and spinning rope. His
hand gets twisted in the pulley with massive force. It rips
skin...bone. Ben Tilly's hand is severed from his body. It
falls to the deck...still clutching the hook.

Tilly's body is not far behind...he grabbles, trying to grab
hold...his foot gets caught in the lines and he falls
backwards...hanging upside down. His body swinging back and
forth with the roll of the boat.

The winch CRANKS AT CAPACITY. Ray joins Julie, grabbing hold
of her, hugging her just as Tilly's body swings towards them,
arm outstretched, They dodge him as...

The boat rolls and Tilly swings to the other side of the
boat, as if flying through the air. He comes at them again.
Fast. Focused.

CLOSE ON THE BOOM

The weight from Tilly's body is causing the pulley to rotate
off its hook.

Tilly swings out over the side of the boat as the pulley
gives way and his body goes crashing down into the deploying
nets.

His body gets tangled every which way in the nets es they
disappear over the side of the boat into the cold, dark
waters. Gone.

Julie looks down to see Ben Tilly's severed hand, lying on
the deck, still clutching the hook. She bends down, defiant,
pumped...she picks it up by the hook, not looking, just
slinging it overboard, as far és her strength will allow.

It disappears into the night.

Ray comes up behind her. She turns to him, grabbing him.
They hold each for dear life.

EXT. FISHING TRAWLER - LATER

The fishing trawler is surrounded by coast guard boats,
police speeders, etc. Lights have been hung, tase in place,
it's now an official crime scene.

ON THE DECK

Two YOUNG OFFICERS set'the winch, watching it spin cable,
raising the nets from the water.

JULIE AND RAY
stand together, watching, shivering in the cold night.

Julie's face is a. world of disbelief. She tries to
comprehend.

JULIE .
We never killed anyone. This last year
was for...
” RAY

I know. The guilt was killing me.

That's why I went to see Missy. I had to
know who he was...I'm sorry I didn't tell
you about Missy. I wanted you back. I
didn't want to lose you again. .

She listens intently, looking deep into his eyes. Silent.

RAY .
I love you, Julie. No one gets me the
way you do.

A slight trace of a smile creeps across her face. A long
moment .

JULIE
I understand your pain.

Ray nods, they come together, holding each other tight.
Suddenly, a FIGURE looms in front of them. It's the local
sheriff. A round man with a serious face.

SHERIFF
(voice over)
Do you have any idea why this man would
want you dead?

Julie looks at Ray. The moment of truth. Do they come

clean? Will it help? A long stare and then, almost
simultaneously.

JULIE
No...

RAY
None...

They stare at the sheriff, their eyes. sincere, their faces
genuine. Then they look to each other, knowingly. Their
secret intact.

OFFICER

(voice over)
Here it comes...

They all turn to the side of the boat es the net makes it's
way out of the water. Wet and muddy. Torn and...empty..

THE FISHERMAN IS GONE.
But wait...there's something. Small and shiny, clinging to
the net. An officer shines a light upon...the fisherman's
severed hand. It still clutches the hook, dangling in the
net...
Ray pulls Julie tight.
CLOSE ON JULIE
Her face a blank page. Emotionless. .
The sheriff turns to Ray and Julie.
SHERIFF
Don't worry. The body will turn
up...they usually do.

Julie turns to the mouth of the harbor, her eyes locked on
the ocean beyond. A long moment and then...

FADE OUT.
INT. DORM ROOM - PRESENT - LATE NIGHT 162

Julie's same dorm room. It appears less drab as if some
interest has been paid to bringing it to life.

ONE YEAR LATER

CONTINUED: . 162

Julie sits at her computer...a familiar scene. Only this
time she types feverishly at the keypad. Her hands moving
rapidly.

The CAMERA comes upon her face and it appears a revelation.
This is the Julie of old. Her youthful face has been
restored. Vibrant and full of energy. She radiates from
within. She's more than survived. She's transcended.

CLOSE ON MONITOR

She's in the middle of chatting with someone on the internet.
She sends a message..."I MADE THE DEAN'S LIST."

She waits for her reply. It comes, "FIGURES."

She types a new message. "HOW'S NEW YORK?" A moment and
then: “LONELY WITHOUT YOU." .

Julie smiles, typing "GOTTA STUDY. I MISS YOU." A moment
and then, “I LOVe YOU."

CLOSE ON JULIE. The “love" word affects her. Suddenly, a
FIGURE appears behind her, a hand on her shoulder...Julie
spins around. It's her roommate, Deb.

She holds an envelope in her hand.

DEB
You got a letter.

Julie takes it. CLOSE ON the envelope, there's no postmark
or return address. Julie's suddenly cautious. It's all too
familiar. She hesitates a moment...but then rips it open.

- DEB
What is it?
Julie scans it, instantly relieved. It's just a flyer.

JULIE
Another frat party. Knock yourself out.

She tosses it to Deb who takes it graciously. Julie turns
back to her computer just as the mailbox in the corner of the
screen begins to flash...dulie has an e-mail.

She moves the cursor to the mailbox and CLICKS. A letter
pops up...SENDER UNIDENTIFIED. Julie CLICKS it open and
COMPLETELY FREAKS OUT. Her face turning a ghostly white as
the life is sucked from it.
