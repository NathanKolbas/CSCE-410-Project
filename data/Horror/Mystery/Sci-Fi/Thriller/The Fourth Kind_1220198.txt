FADE FROM WHITE:
ON A WINDING ROAD

lined with a wooden guide rail, FOG rolls by as a FIGURE
approaches, obscuring who or what IT is.

As IT gets closer, its gait can be discerned --
HUMANOID.

ITS build is oversized yet solid -- and ITS face has two
LARGE BLACK EYES, that cut clearly through the white snow
and fog like miniature black holes.

IT continues to walk closer, and a hand reaches up and PULLS
OFF THE EYES -- which are actually GOGGLES -- revealing ITS
identity:

PIGURE
My name is Olatunde Osunsanmi, the
director of 4TH KIND.

Olatunde continues walking towards us, his heavy winter
clothing bulking up his frame.

OLATUNDE

This film will be a dramatization of
events that occurred October 1st
through the 9th of 2000 in the
northern Alaskan town of Nome. To
better explain the events of this
story, I have included actual archived
footage throughout the film. This
footage was obtained from Nome
psychiatrist Dr. Abbey Tyler, who
has personally documented over 65
hours of video and audio materials
during the time of the incidents.
In an effort to protect their privacy,
we have altered the names and
professions of many of the people
involved.

(pause)
Every dramatized scene in this film,
will be supported by either archived
audio, video, or as it was related
to me by Dr. Tyler herself during
extensive interview sessions. In
the end what you believe, will be
yours to decide.

Olatunde comes to a stop as breath rises from his mouth.
OLATUNDE
Please be advised that some of what
you are about to see is extremely
disturbing.

CUT TO WHITE:
FADE IN:
IN AN INTERVIEW ROOM.

Several 50 inch WIDESCREEN MONITORS are mounted on the walls,
creating a collage of ABSTRACT MOTION on their screens.

THE REAL ABBEY TYLER sits in a chair, the camera frames her
from the waist up.

She is a thirty-eight year old female with a good deal of
pain evident in her eyes. She's rail thin, edges of bones
pushing out her skin like needles under tissue paper.

The left corner of her mouth twitches cccasionally as she
looks to the right of camera, where the interviewer sits.

OLATUNDE (0.S.)
Please state your name for the camera.

THE REAL DR. TYLER
Doctor Abigail Elizabeth Tyler.

OLATUNDE
Have you provided us with Che master
tapes from your archive?

THE REAL DR. TYLER
Yes I have.

OLATUNDE {0.S.)
Is everything you are about to tell
me as close to factual as possible?

THE REAL DR. TYLER
{nods)
Yes, yes it is.

OLATUNDE (0.S.)
Are you willing to submit to a lie
detector test to confirm these
answers?

THE REAL DR. TYLER
Yes I am.

CLATUNDE (0.S.)
Thank you...So, where would you like
to begin?

Seated to the left is ABBEY TYLER, 36, a widow whose suffering
has permeated her every being.

Across from her is DR. ABEL CAMPOS, 50, a psychiatrist whose
disposition is relaxed, composed, and comforting.

On a table between them a portable TAPE RECORDER records.

a calming breath.

 
TITLE: Dr. Abbey Tyler
Campos stands over her and extends a finger.

CAMPOS (C.S.)
Watch my finger as I count back...20,
19, 18, 17...

Abbey's eyes roll up as she follows his finger over her head.
Then slowly, her eyes close.

Campos sits down out of frame.

CAMPOS
(gently)
Abbey, lets go back to the night of
September 9th of this year.

ABBEY
Mm-hmm.

CAMPOS
What was the weather like?

ABBEY
Warm...warmer than normal...even
though it was snowing outside.

CAMPOS
Now...let's go to when you were with
Will -- just before the intruder
entered your room.

ABBEY
OK.

CAMPOS

Describe what you see.

Abbey's eyes are working hard beneath her eye lids, flickering
back and forth. Then her face relaxes and a smile parts her
lips.

ABBEY
We're making love...it was wonderful
kind, gentle...

FADE IN LEFT FRAME OF SPLIT/SCREEN:
ABBEY'S P.O.V. as she leans down and kisses WILL, 35, a man
in love with the woman above him. He gently caresses her

cheek as they make love.

...then we fell asleep....

TIMECODE: 00:01:45

 

She's quiet a moment.

CAMPOS
What do you remember next?

ABBEY
We're awake...both of us...wide awake.
..-And we're...lying here...

CAMPOS
What woke you up?

ABBEY
I don't...Nothing...we were
just...lying here...
TIMECODE: 00:02:02
IN LEFT FRAME: ABBEY IS LYING

next to Will. His eyes are open, darting back and forth as
they study her...

A shadow falls over Will's face, and then

 

METAL SLAMS DOWN

into his

CHEST,

BLASTING into his SKIN as
BLCOD EXPLODES UPWARDS.

Abbey breaths in sharply and pulls back in SHOCK. She looks
up at the INTRUDER -- and FLINCHES back and

SCREAMS --
-- FADE OUT LEFT FRAME --
RIGHT FRAME NOW FILLS ENTIRE SCREEN
Abbey SHRIEKS
at the top of her lungs and covers her face with her arms.

TIMECODE: 00:02:43
ABBEY
Oh my God! Someone stabbed him! In
the chest! Oh my G--!

 

CAMPOS
Abbey! Stay with me! Stay with me!
What do you see?

ABBEY
I don't know! I--it's too much!
It's moving so fast, but it feels
like we're frozen-- I can't see it!

CAMPOS
Shhhh. Abbey relax! Calm down, Try
and see the face!

ABBEY
Oh my God not again. I can't--I
can't see it! PLEASE STOP! PLEASE
STOP! OHMYGOD! STOP-STOP-STOP-SIOP-
STOP-!! IT'S TOO MUCH! IT‘S TOO
MUCH!

Dr. Campos tries to regain control, counts her back out of
hypnosis as she wails uncontrollably.

CAMPOS

eS --Focus on my voice--

ABBEY
~HE'S BLEEDING EVERYWHERE! THERE'S
BLOOD ALL OVER ME-

CAMPOS
-Focus on my voice, you will be fully
awakened and conscious in 5,4,3,2,1...

Abbey breaks hypnosis, sits up, doesn't remember crying,
wipes tears, sits a moment silently, awkwardly, before burying
her face in her hands and crying.

Campos puts an arm around her shoulders.

CAMPOS
Abbey...

She cries for a little bit longer and then wipes her eyes.

ABBEY
If I could just see his face we
could...I--feel so...He was killed
and I was right there--and I--I--
can't described who did it...!
CAMPOS
It's natural to feel guilt...it's
just as unnatural to feel it was
your fault.

She wipes her face again.
ABBEY

(whispers)
I can't help it.

CAMPOS
You said something there...you said
'It's too much.’ What did you mean

by that?
Abbey thinks a moment...and then slowly shakes her head.

ABBEY
«..I don't know....

CAMPOS
It feels like maybe it's...something
we should keep an eye on.

Campos holds her hands in a very paternal way, trying to
comfort her.

TIMECODE: 00:04:57

CAMPOS
You should consider taking some time
off -- real time. That two weeks

didn't count. It may help you find
clarity with what happened--

ABBEY
I want to finish the study.

CAMPOS
Which is exactly what I knew you'd
say. Which is what you always say
when confronted with the notion of
spending time away from work. Uncle
Sam isn't exactly beating down your
door for a return on his investment.

Abbey shakes her head.
ABBEY
It meant a lot to Will. He would of
wanted me to finish it as soon as I
could.

Off Campos' lock --

 

 
ABBEY

@ I'll be OK.

She stands up abruptly lifting her face out of frame, wiping
stray tears, attempting to pull it together
ABBEY
I know you wouldn't, but please don't
tell anyone about our sessions.
(small smile)
Wouldn't be good for my practice.

CAMPOS
Of course.

TIMECODE: 00:05:29

He reaches towards the camera, pulls the tape out and hands
it to her.

ABBEY
Thanks.

CUT TO:
A RED CESNA

SOARS HIGH above the SNOW COVERED world of Alaska, cutting
@ hard to the left as it ROARS across the afternoon sky.

IN THE COCKPIT

Abbey flies the plane, her face is a little more composed.
Flying is the best therapy of all.

A family picture of Will and her two children Ronnie and
Ashley decorates the dashboard.

FADE IN TEXT -- 'THE VOICE OF DR. TYLER‘
THE REAL DR. TYLER (V.O.)
When I flew, I felt at peace. It
was just me, the wind and the clouds.
THE CESNA

straightens out and FLIES over

SNOW COVERED MOUNTAINS -- their rolling hills of white are
blindingly beautiful.

THE REAL DR. TYLER (V.O.
I think Alaskans are lucky in that
way--that flying is one of the only
ways to get around the state.
10

The plane SOARS UP and over another MOUNTAIN RANGE, revealing
a town nestled next to the sparkling waters of the ARCTIC, ™
and the MONSTROUS blue-white ice of a GLACIER behind it.

This is a town on the edge of the wild.

some Clear air turbulence ahead,
some cross winds, descend to one-
fifty, hold at altitude.
ABBEY
(to mic)
Thanks--descending to one-fifty and
holding, ten-twenty-three.
Abbey throttles down and the plane begins its descent.
ABOVE NOME
the AIRPORT RUNWAY comes into view as 1923 glides towards

it, passing over the warehouse style buildings and two lane
roadways cf Nome.

ABBEY
Ten-twenty-three's landing -- have a

ORI (radio)
You too Abbey, thank you.

She pulls hard to the left,
BANKING THE PLANE

almost sideways in a fighter jet like maneuver. The wing
flaps straighten out, straightening out the plane as

Abbey throttles down further and tilts the nose up as the @

up to meet her.

MATCH CUT TO:
ABBEY'S VCLVO ROARS

down Ahkovak Street. Snow covered barrack type buildings
dominate both sides of the road. She turns left

ONTO APAYAUK STREET,
heading south as snow falls.

CUT TO:

OUTSIDE TYLER'S HEALTH & CARE,

Abbey's car pulls into the driveway of a Victorian styled
building, passing a SIGN: TYLER'S HEALTH & CARE.

IN THE LOBBY

Abbey strides in fully composed and collected. She passes
by her secretary's desk, where THERESA[ALIAS], 50's, a dark
haired woman with beauty rarely seen at her age, types ona
computer.

ABBEY
Any messages?

THERESA
No, but Scott's waiting in your
office, and you have a four and a
five o'clock.

ABBEY
(nods)
Thanks.

THERESA
How was it coming in?

ABBEY
Bumpy. You'd think as beautiful as
that sky was, the air could never be
that rough.

THERESA
The stuff that really shakes us, we
seldom ever see coming.

Abbey kind of smiles at that, what it means, how matter-of-
factly it was uttered. She walks down a hallway and into

HER OFFICE
12

to find SCOTT STRACINSKY[ALIAS], 41 -- Troubled. Tense.
Sleepless circles are carved beneath his eyes.

TITLE: (CAST MEMBER) as SCOTT STRACINSKY
Abbey beams, greets him warmly.

ABBEY
How you doing Scott?

SCOTT
Alright.

She closes the door and sets her stuff down on her desk.
Wooden panelled bookshelves line three of the walls, and the
fourth a wall of windows featuring a vast snowscape outside.

A deep leather couch flanked by two plush chairs are at the

center of the room, her desk is off to the side. This is an
office of comfort, of trust. One feels at ease within these
walis.

ABBEY
Make yourself comfortable.

They sit on the chairs directly across from each other. On
the coffee table she pushes eject on her tape recorder and
inserts a tape labeled: SCOTT STRACINSKY

in front of a series of COZY BUNGALOWS known as

NOME ELEMENTARY SCHOCL.

SCHOOL CHILDREN meander about, walking home or waiting for
their rides.

IN NOME ELEMENTARY SCHOOL -- LOBBY.
16

ASHLEY TYLER, 6, the cutest, saddest, little girl you've
ever seen, sits on a bench looking straight ahead, not seeing
the children as they pass by her.

 

Next to her rests a long white walking stick. This child is
blind.

RALPH[ALIAS] (6} runs up to Ashley and makes all kinds of
faces at her. She whips up her stick and just misses his
face.

RALPH
Hey!

ASHLEY
Knock it off.

He sticks out his tongue one more time and runs off.
FADE IN TEXT -- THE REAL DR. TYLER

THE REAL DR. TYLER (V.O.)
I felt so sorry for my baby...and I
feel...responsible...it's not a
phenomenon that a lot of people
understand and we've had to make
quite an adjustment.

 

 

FADE OUT TEXT -- THE REAL DR. TYLER @.

Abbey enters the LOBBY and walks over to her. She looks at
her daughter with sad eyes, but she keeps it from her voice.

ABBEY
Hi sweetheart.

ASHLEY
Hi mommy.

ABBEY

What's wrong?

ASHLEY
Nothing.

Abbey takes her hand and she stands up. They walk out
ONTO THE STREET
and towards her car, Abbey leading the way.

ABBEY
How was school?

ASHLEY
on. ®
ABBEY
Yeah? OK? Did something happen?

A beat.

ASHLEY
Ralph called me a 'faker'.

ABBEY
A what? A "faker?"

ASHLEY
He said I could see before and now I
was just pretending. He said I just
wanted everybody to feel sorry for
me because of Daddy.

Abbey blanches, hates hearing this kind of stuff.

ABBEY
Wasn't Ralph the kid your friends
caught eating his own boogers?

This makes Ashley smile.

ASHLEY
Yeah.

ABBEY
Then why are we worried about what
Ralph's saying. Ralph's got his own
problems.

ASHLEY
Yeah mommy.

ABBEY
(pends to tickle her)
Yeah?

ASHLET
(squirming)
YEAH!
Abbey picks her tiny body up in to her arms and spins her
around. The two girls laugh as they get in and Abbey starts
the car up.
CUT TO:
OUTSIDE ABBEY'S HOUSE -- EVENING

It's a two story house situated up on a hill that looks like
it's right out of a storybook.

Snow falls lightly as the Volvo pulls up into the driveway,
all of Nome can be seen behind it.
18

IN ABBEY'S KITCHEN
Ashley sits at the kitchen table listening to the Discovery
Channel on TV. She passes her hand back and forth in front
of her eyes, trying to see it.

Abbey cooks soup and meat loaf behind her.

ASHLEY
Mom?

ABBEY
Yes sweetheart.

ASHLEY
When's dinner gonna be ready?

ABBEY
Soon.

ASHLEY
How soon?

ABBEY

Real soon.

The kitchen door opens and RONNIE[ALIAS], 15, walks inside,
his boots caked in snow. He's tall for his age, has an
athletic build and a huge chip on his shoulder.

ABBEY
Hi darling.
ASHLEY
Hi!
RONNIE
(mutters)
Hey.

Abbey glances over at him.

ABBEY
Your boots.

He sighs, takes them off, throws them next to the door, and
walks cff into the living room. Abbey watches him go.

IN ABBEY'S DINNING ROOM
the three of them sit at the dinning room table in prayer.

Abbey and Ashley's heads are bowed, Ronnie's is not, and his
eyes are open.

 

 
 

 

 

19

ABBEY
Lord, thank you for everything we
have. Please continue to bless our
family. Please help Ashley overcome
her loss of sight, help her see again
like she did. Thank you, in Jesus!
name we pray, Amen.

ASHLEY
Amen.

They begin eating in awkward silence.

ABBEY
{to Ronnie)
How was school?

RONNTE
(shrugs)
It was alright.

ABBEY
Learn anything new?

RONNIE
No.
The silence ccntinues for awhile. Ashley cocks her ear back
and forth between the two of them.

ABBEY
(to Ronnie)
What time's your game tomorrow?

RONNIE
Seven.

ABBEY
Who you playing?

RONNIE
I told you already, Browerville.

ABBEY
I'm sorry, I forgot.

RONNIE
Dad never forgot.

That comment stings Abbey.

ABBEY
Well...your dad's not here.

RONNIE
No...he's not.
(MORE)
20

RONNIE (CONT'D)
(looking up, glowering)
Can you accept it yet?

ABBEY
Accept what?
RONNIE
(like stone)
..-what happened to dad.

Abbey absently grabs a platter of food.

ABBEY

Not in front of your sister.
ASHLEY

What do you mean?
ABBEY

Nothing honey.
RONNIE

You're never gonna face it are you?
ABBEY

Stop it.
ASHLEY

Face what?

Ronnie turns to Ashley, seems to forget she’s only six.

RONNIE
How dad died.
Ashley gasps.
ABBEY
Damn it Ronnie! What's wrong with

you?
Ronnie pushes himself back from the table.

RONNIE
You go around helping other people
with their problems--

ABBEY
--stop it! stop it!--

RONNIE
--and you can't even help yourself.

ABBEY
--What the hell is that supposed to
mean--?

 
 

Ronnie walks out.

RONNIE
--Or your kids...

Somewhere in the house, a door slams.

ASHLEY
Mommy...? What did--what does he
mean...?
No answer...
ASHLEY

Mommy... ?

Unable to answer Abbey looks at her angelic face...at
innocence only a child can demonstrate.

CUT TO:
OUTSIDE OF ABBEY'S HOUSE

the night is complete. An OWL perched on a branch watches
through the windows as lights are turned off. All is still.

could I not help myself, I couldn't
help him either.
IN ABBEY'S LIVING ROOM
she turns off the lights and walks down the
HALLWAY
to
ASHLEY'S BEDROOM DOOR.

She peeks in and sees Ashley lying in bed. The love is
obvious on her face. She continues

DOWN THE HALLWAY
to Ronnie's recom. The door is cracked and she peeks
INSIDE.

He's lying in bed as well, the lights are off. She stares,
unsure what to do about him, then walks away.

Ronnie opens his eyes as his mother walks away, then slowly
closes them again.

ABBEY WALKS BY
another door, hesitates, then goes back and opens it.
IN THE STUDY.

Abbey turns the lights on revealing a rather large room with
two desks and books everywhere.

She walks over to Will's desk which is covered by papers,
folders and books in an orderly fashion -- it's as if it
were still in use.

A book catches her eye...it has a bookmark sticking out of
one of it's pages...marking a chapter titled: SUMERIAN.
Written on the bookmark is a name: AWOLOWA ODUSAMI, and
beneath it a PHONE NUMBER.

Kian

Beside the book sits a tape recorder. She considers it for ®@
a moment, and then presses play.

cuddles next to her mom.

ASHLEY
If he came back would I be able to

ABBEY
Honey he can't come back. OK? He
can't. You'll be able to see

again...but you have to accept that

His breathing increases, sweat starting to form.

ABBEY &.

On the count of three you will return

TOMMY
NONONONONO!

ABBEY

Tommy
CLIMBS BACK
HALFWAY OUT OF FRAME and

over the couch -- trying to get away from whatever it is
that he's seeing --

and HITS
a coffee table HARD,
SHATTERING it

into a million pieces.

 

CAMERA ANGLE: He can still be seen on video, just behind the e
couch.

TIMECODE: 00:04:59

He sobs like a little kid, curls up into a fetal position,
hiding his face, his hands bloodied, smearing it everywhere,
still emitting the most shrill, ear-piercing screams, as if
his soul were being gouged out with a spoon.

Abbey rushes over and kneels next to him, snapping her
fingers.

ABBEY
Tommy, it's not happening! It's a
memory! Come out of it!

Theresa hurries into the room, concerned, barely recognizing
Tommy who's been transformed by the hysterics.

THERESA
T-Tommy ?

ABBEY
It's alright Tommy...it's alright.

It's not real. @

Tommy, adamant.
TOMMY
It is real.

 

ABBEY
What did you see?

He looks around the room at the couch -- which has been shoved
a few feet back -- he sees the shattered coffee table...his
eyes hold no recollection of how it got that way. Finally:

TOMMY
Did I do all that?
ABBEY
Yeah you did, but it's OK.

(beat )
What did you see?

Tommy looks at her hard, intent...then slowly shakes his

head.
TOMMY
It was..... ers Nothing.
ABBEY
But you said you saw something.
TOMMY
@ No...I didn't see anything.

TIMECODE: 00:06:02
He starts to get up, STANDING OUT OF FRAME.

THERESA
I'll call Sarah to pick you up--

TOMMY
No--I can--I'll drive myself.

ABBEY
Please, Tommy. We're trying to help.

TOMMY
Then help me get out of this room --
I just need to get home.

Abbey holds a moment, looking at Tommy. There's still this
great sense of fear, circling him, clouding over....

TOMMY
I'm ok...I'm ok.
AEBEY
Who are you trying to convince? Me

@ or you?

ABBEY (CONT'D)

Tommy, did you see what's been keeping
you up? Was it the owl?

 

Tommy moves as though his skin were crawling.

TOMMY
I need to...
(pauses, can't bring
himself to}
Can we talk about it next time?

ABBEY
(sighs, nods)
Sure...if you're ready by then.

TOMMY
(nods)
Iam. I will be.
He points to the shattered coffee table.

TOMMY
Do you need me to pay for--

Abbey waves that suggestion off.

ABBEY @
No--don't worry--its fine. ~

And with that, Tommy hastily grabs his jacket and walks cut
of the office. Abbey closes the door behind him, then leans
back on it and lets out a breath. She holds a moment,
thinking, before crossing to her desk.

 

ABBEY
Theresa could you get Tommy's wife
on the phone please.

So he was under hypnosis and that's

Father comits murder-suicide

By Kate Ripple
Fairbanks Daity News

Nome, Alaska - Tommy Fisher murdered
bis wife and two children before committing
suicide yesterday night at approximately 3:30
AM, following several hours of hostage neg-
atiations. Authorities have yet to determine
roti vation and no ate was left behind.

 

Neighbors have commented that Tommy fr-
equently complained of insomia and had paid
regolar visits to a psychiateist. Homicide in
Nome is higher than the state average due to
multiple unsolved murder and missing person
cases dating back to the 1960's,

 

 
@

ABBEY
Yeah.

AUGUST
How do you know what he saw was real?

She's quiet a moment.

ABBEY
I don't know that it was.

AUGUST
So what you're telling me is that
Tommy might have done all of this
based on something that may not exist
at all.

ABBEY
All I know, is that he believed what
he saw. And I saw more fear in his
eyes than I've ever seen in my life.

AUGUST
Had you not hypnotized him, would he
have done these things?

ABBEY
What do you mean?

AUGUST
If you hadn't hypnotized him, would
he have murdered his family?

ABBEY
That's a ridiculous and offensive
questi--

AUGUST

--What's ridiculous and offensive is
that an entire family is lying in
the morgue from a murder suicide and
the last meaningful contact the
murderer had, was with you.

ABBEY
What happened last night would have
manifested itself eventually.
Whatever it was it was something
he'd been suppressing. In eleven
years of practice I've never--

AUGUST
--Why didn't you notify us? If you
suspected that he was unstable, after
an admittediy violent episode, in
your presence, in your office--

38
39

ABBEY
--When he left he was perfectly
coherent. JI called his wife and
asked her to keep an eye on him.

 

AUGUST
And now she's dead.

Abbey rises to her feet, her eyes blazing.

ABBEY

I'm not gonna sit here--
AUGUST

sit down.
ABBEY

--and listen to your theories on how
hypnosis induced murder--

AUGUST
sit! Down!

ABBEY
~-caused this--

AUGUST
I'm trying to figure out what caused
one of the worst homicides in the
history of Nome--

 

ABBEY
--There's something going on in this
town that we don't understand.
There's something happening to people
when they sleep--

AUGUST
--I deal in what I see, not
hallucinations. Not visions in the
ether, but real fiesh and blood
things, four of which are lying on
slabs next door--

Abbey SLAMS her fist onto the table.

ABBEY
How dare you-- my husband was lying
on those same goddamn slabs, and you
still haven't found his killer--

AUGUST
--WHAT? You know goddamn well what
happened to Will--the case is closed

for Christ's sakes-- @
ABBEY
No--No--you can't just file these
things away without getting to what
really happened. There are more
unsclved murders and missing people
in Nome than any other city in Alaska--
three years of which have been under
your watch! Whatever is happening
in this town is real, is dangerous,
and must be dealt with!

 

August glares at her hard, then pushes stop on the recorder
and stands up, towering over her.

AUGUST
As Sheriff of this town I'm warning
you professionally. As a citizen
and someone who grew up here, I'm
warning you personally. Stop.
Whatever governmental study you're
conducting, whatever you and your
husband were after, is bringing
nothing but bad things to a town
that's had enough. Now if I decided
to press, I could make you an
accessory to a multiple homicide. I
don't want that...just like I don't
want whatever you're doing to
continue. So, in fairness, let this
be understood...you've been warned.

 

cUT TO:
ABBEY'S HANDS SHAKE.

She balls them up in a fist and holds them tight. She's
sitting on her BEDROOM BED, and tears are rolling silently
down her face.

Fully clothed she lies down and curis into a little ball.
She stays in that position, her eyes darting back and
forth...thinking, thinking.

FADE IN RIGHT FRAME: THE INTERVIEW ROOM.

THE CAMERA is closer now, FRAMING Dr. Tyler in a CLOSE UP.
Her eyes are red from crying, but her cheeks are now dry.

THE REAL DR. TYLER
You kncow...at the time...this was
the worst day of my life...No matter
what I told myself, no matter what
excuses I came up with...there was
Sc much guilt--guilt cn tep of guilt

THE MORNING SUN RISES

above Nome, blazing rays off the snow and ice, and revealing
a SNOW OWL sitting on a tree branch -~ it's eyes boring right
into us.

CUT TO:
CUTSIDE ABBEY'S OFFICE, DRIVEWAY.
Light snow falls as Abbey drives up to find Theresa talking

quietly to someone unexpected -- Dr. Abel Campos. She kills
the engine and gets out.

 

 
 

42

ABBEY
Abel?

CAMPOS
...I heard what happened. I wanted
to make sure you were OK.

ABBEY
You came all the way up here?

He opens his arms wide and gives her a warm hug. At first
she resists and then relents while fighting back tears.

ABBEY
(sighs)
You didn't have to, I'm fine.

CAMPOS
you want to talk?

She pulls away and digs in her purse.

ABBEY
I can't--not now. Theresa could you
transcribe this for me?

She hands her the PORTABLE RECORDER, and starts to head
inside.

THERESA
(watches, inspects
her)
Do you want me to cancel your schedule--

ABBEY
No-no-~

THERESA
--I'm sure they'll understand...

CAMPOS
..-Abbey...

She finally turns back around.

CAMPOS
How you feeling?

ABBEY
(lies)
Ready to get the day started.

CAMPOS
A lot's happened. None of it good.
You think maybe it's time to take a
step back, maybe consider a
sabbatical.
43

ABBEY
I love that word, it doesn't sound
anything like what it actually means,
which is "time off."

 

CAMPOS
Then call it a "break."

ABBEY
I did a lot of, thinking, a lot of
soul searching about...what I'm doing
here, about myself, Will.

She shakes her head slowly.

ABBEY
I would have never, ever thought, in
a million years, that Tommy, would
do what he did and wipe out his entire
existence.

CAMPOS
~-Abbey--

ABBEY
--Nor would I have thought, that I'd
be sitting here as a widow when less
than a month ago I was happily married
and raising two healthy children,
one of which has now lost their sight
as a result of all this...

 

CAMPOS
~-you need to step away...for
perspective--clarity on what happened.
You can't continue~-

ABBEY
--No Abel. TI can. And have to.
That's the only thing that's still
possible, within my power...
Continuing. Finding out what's caused
this. I don't believe that what
happened to Will and what happened
to Tommy and his family are unrelated.
I don't think that five people slain
in a little over three weeks can be
chalked up to simple coincidence--
especially in a town that has a
history of death and disappearance.

Campos says nothing, staring at the snow.

CAMPOS

Then would you mind if I stayed on

for a bit? @
(MORE)
 

44

CAMPOS (CONT'D)
Kept an eye on you, since you don't
seem too keen on doing so yourself.

Abbey can't help the tears, she embraces Campos. He holds
her fast.

IN ABBEY'S OFFICE, LATER
Abbey walks in to find Scott Stracinsky and his wife

CINDY{ALIAS] (31) seated on the couch. Scott is clearly
agitated, having trouble sitting still.

ABBEY
Good morning.

scott
Hey.

CINDY

'Morning doctor.

Abbey sets her things down and then sits in the chair next
to them. They are clearly tense. Abbey does her best to
ease into things.

ABBEY
So...lots to talk about.

Scott, anxious, chomping at the bit.

scoTtT
(almost blurting out)
What happened to Tommy?

ABBEY
I can't really discuss another
patient's--

sScoTT
--He's dead. You should be able to
discuss everything!

Abbey relents a bit.
ABBEY
It was something--I believe--to do
with his sleeping habits.
Cindy caresses Scott's shoulders. He is inconsolable.
CINDY
We're really worried, obviously.

It's the second suicide in a month...

ABBEY
I understand.
45

ScoTT
We want you to hypnotize me too. We
need to know if there's anything I'm
not remembering. I feel like--we
feel like-~-that the best thing to do
is to face it.

 

ABBEY

Tf you want to undergo that, it has
to be done very delicately.

{beat, then)
Is it alright if I have Dr. Campos
come in to observe? He's a visiting
doctor that I trust, and I think we
should have another pair of eyes and
ears in here.

The couple look at each other and nod in agreement.

ScorTT
Sure.

Yes.

An owl.

Abbey looks over at Campos.

ABBEY
Tell me about the owl.

scott
Its a white owl...its eyes are big,

like a normal owl....

He trails off and stops, confusion crosses his face.

ABBEY
Scott?

His head turns to the left, then to the right, as if on
strings.

SCOTT
There is no owl.

He grows alarmed.

scott
Honey, wake-up. Did you hear that?

Scott pushes the couch on his left side, as if trying to
wake up his wife.

SCOTT
Wake-up! She's not waking up.
Someone's outside the door.

Then he freezes and sucks in his breath hard and sharp, and
his face contorts in complete and absolute terror.

He WHIMPERS and starts to hide behind his hands.

ABBEY

SCcoTT

They're gonna open the door...How'd
they get in without setting off the
alarm? I armed it! I know I did!

(he shivers)
I thought they only come when I think
about them, I wasn't thinking about
them tonight!

He puts his hands together in prayer.
SCOTT

Our father which though in heaven,
hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom
come, thy will be done--give us this
day our daily bread, forgive-- They're

Then he jerks back VIOLENTLY and

SHRIEKS!

SscoTT
AAHHHHHH! NOOOO! AAHHHHHEHH!

ABBEY

Scott gives a final yell and then jumps to his feet. He
looks around at them in complete SHOCK.

He sinks back to the couch, holding his stomach, then GAGS

and THROWS UP

all over the floor. Abbey rubs his back, trying to relax
him.

 

ABBEY
It's OK...it's OK...

SCOTT
(erying)
It's unbelievable. It doesn't make
any sense!

ABBEY
You don't have to rush. Whenever
you're ready you can tell us what
you saw.

Campos hands him a tissue and he wipes his mouth then starts
making strong gestures.

SCOTT
(harsh whisper)
Abbey...these...I saw them.

ABBEY
Who are them?

ScoTT
They're not from here.

ABBEY
What do you mean?

 

scott

(crying)
They're not from here, they don't
look like you! They don't look like
us. They're tall, like six and a
half feet, and really skinny,

(gestures to her)
like half as wide as you. And their
skin is this-this-this beige color,
like the color of an egg and they've
got these gigantic heads, that make
a point in the back...

(pauses)
And their eyes. They're black, and
go huge--

He cups his hands together making a GIANT OVAL. Abbey can't
disguise her disbelief, as she slowly pulls away from him.

SCOTT
And they're slanted so they fit their
head--and I remember the smell--like
a-a-a putrid, cinnamon--do you
@ UNDERSTAND what I'm saying?

And the worse part was the voice in

they take me away, to somewhere--b-b-
but I can't remember where, I-I-can't
remember what they DO to me....I--

He can't go on, convulsing hard as he cries. And no one can
even move to comfort him. His own wife Cindy, immobilized
with fear and disbelief

Abbey and Campos exchange looks -- what the hell is going on
here?

ABBEY
That will be enough for today.

Cindy goes over to her husband and hugs him.

CINDY
I'm sorry...

ABBEY
Now, because of the circumstances
I'm going to have to inform Sheriff
August that we met. That we had
this session.

down.

An awkward moment. Abbey trying to process the larger meaning
when:

Scott stands, steps around the vomit.

I'm sorry--

ABBEY
It's OK--

scoTT

--if you need me to--

ABBEY
--don't worry about it, we'll get it
cleaned up--OK?

SCOTT
(takes a breath)
...OK thanks.

Scott walks out of her office, with Cindy's help. Abbey
glances over at Campos who is still glued to his seat, his
eyes pinned to her.

CAMPOS
What the hell was that?

TIMECODE: 00:07:39

She walks over to the camera and switches it OFF. She sits
on the couch and takes a deep breath.

ABBEY
Have you heard of abduction theories?

CAMPOS
Abductions? Like kidnappings?

ABBEY
Yeah, but...no. Abductions as in...

Abbey, leading him along. Campos' face suddenly falls.
Sl

 

CAMPOS

Wait, like “alien"? Alien abductions?
ABBEY

I'm pretty sure that's what we just

heard.
Campos, shaking his head in disbelief, disdain.

ABBEY
If you look at the statistics
.. they're impressive. Will was
into that a little bit...

She trails off, recalling...processing...

ABBEY
He did a little research and found
that there are ninety million people
worldwide who have reported seeing
or know of someone who saw a UFO
since 1930.

CAMPOS
(dismissive)
The idea that any of that is real...

ABBEY
Come on Abel, you're not going to
take the classic scientific stance
against something that boasts ninety-
million witnesses? That many people
wins any court case in the world.

 

CAMPOS
There are just as many logical
explanations and reasons. Weather
balloons, atmospheric effects, optical
illusions...We have te deal in hard,
empirical evidence, not--

POUND-POUND-POUND--someone's knocking on the door. Theresa
barges into the room breathing hard, her eyes wild, her manner

unhinged.

THERESA
You 'retapehaveyouheardyourtape!?

ABBEY
Slow down, what's wrong?

THERESA
You're tape-- the one you gave me to-
transcribe, have ycu listened to it?

ABBEY @

What is it?
 

 

IN THE OFFICE LOBBY, MOMENTS LATER.

Theresa grabs the PORTABLE recorder off her desk and hits
REWIND. Abbey and Campos stand next to her. Abbey looks
deeply concerned...and a little scared.

THERESA
I don't know what it is, what's going
on. I'm just going to hit play okay?
(pauses, looking back
at Abbey)
I don't want to hear it again.

Theresa hits
PLAY
and then hurries out of the room.

Behind her the comforter is intertwined with the bed sheets --
it's a complete mess.

IN RIGHT FRAME: Olatunde hits play, and we hear Dr. Tyler
snoring softly...

(searches. for words)
Something like that would of destroyed
my reputation in a heartbeat. Doctors-~--

AWOLOWA
It's an incomplete translation--we

ABBEY
Whatever it said...sounds aggressive.

CAMPOS
(can't process)
This isn't making sense.

AWOLOWA
If this is authentic, then it's the
first ever verbalized recording of
the Sumerian language. We're talking
about the oldest language in human
history--

up the tape recorder--

AWOLOWA
--with a key on how to speak it.

ABBEY
But what was happening in my room?
What was being done to me?

AWOLOWA
What's unsettling..is that whatever
it is...it's vocals...it doesn't

ABBEY
You mean human?

CAMPOS
Stop. Stop. Stop. Let's not fuel
any more of these fires.
(to Awolowa)
There's any number of reasons for
the distortion in that voice.

AWOLOWA
I'm not jumping to conclusions, but
her voice sounds fine.

CAMPOS
The tape could have been recorded
over and part of the old recording
is still heard--

ABBEY
I don't recycle tapes.

CAMPOS
Well maybe you did this time!
AWOLOWA
That still doesn't explain why that
voice is speaking a language that
pre-dates Egyptian hieroglyphics.

 

Campos can't respond.

I've researched the Sumerian
civilization for the last fifteen
years of my life...and the things
I've found in-~in relation to this

AWOLOWA (CONT'D)
The Alien-God legend has it's basis,
it's origins, in Sumerian history.

Astounded they look at Awolowa, trying to process the flood
of information. The phone is ringing but no one hears it.

AWOLOWA
you can find everything I've described
in a museum right now.

CAMPOS
Bullshit.

AWOLOWA
And you're entitled to that reaction.
I stated from the beginning that I
would draw no conclusions, I am giving
facts. Proof, from thousand of years
of data collection and research.

Campos turns to Abbey.

CAMPOS
It's one thing to entertain a wild
theory, it's quite another to invest
in it. You honestly believe you
were forcibly taken from your bedroom
by members of an alien race?

Abbey, flummoxed, frustrated. The phone continues to ring
incessantly. Abbey reaches over wearily, picking up the
receiver.

ABBEY
(she listens)
Cindy? Sweetie, take a breath and
try and calm down. Do you think
he's a threat to you, or to himself?

Abbey eyes lock on Campos.

ABBEY
Good, where is he? OK, OK. Just
stay there. Don't call the police.
Not yet.

CUT TO:

OUTSIDE A TWO STORY BROWN HOUSE.

Snow falls as the Volve pulls into the driveway, and the
three of them hurriedly get out of the car and walk up to
the door.

Abbey knocks, and Cindy answers. Her eyes fall questioningly
on Awolowa.
 

ABBEY
This is Dr. Odusami. He's here to
help.
AWOLOWA
Good morning.
She nods -- too impatient to argue.
CINDY

ABBEY
I'm here now...alright? Take your
time...breathe for me, just try to
keep yourself calm, I won't be able
to help you if you're worked up.

He swallows, bites back a flow of tears that seem to have
sprung from nowhere.

ScoTT
-.-I don't want to talk about it
but I have to. I have to, Ihaveto-

ABBEY
I'm gonna set up the camera, alright?

Scott
No, I don't need anyon-- I don't
want this getting out or--

ABBEY
--Scott, I need to make a record of
this, I need to record your session
for study, so we can find out what's
going on with you.

 

A reluctant Scott nods and Campos sets-up the camera on the
tripod.

SCOTT
IT don't want to go under.

ABBEY
Then let's not do that. You relay
as much as you can remember.

scott
There's things...that I-I-I h-have

ABBEY
Scott, I can put you under a very

THE REAL DR. TYLER
I said no.

An intelligible male voice is heard off camera. Olatunde
looks towards the voice.

OLATUNDE
I want the audience to be able to
experience it with her--so they know
what it was like--so they can feel
what she went through at the time.
Is that--

The voice interrupts, utters something unintelligible.

OLATUNDE
(to voice)
That's all. We only do it once.
(to Abbey)
Is that OK with you?

The male voice speaks again and Dr. Tyler turns her head
awkwardly to look at him, and then back to Olatunde and nods.

ABBEY
(sighs)
OK.
OLATUNDE
Thank you.

Thank you for agreeing to this.
Olatunde indicates a monitor to the right of where he sits.

now...you're not alone...relax...

Scott slumps in his bed and is quiet. The three look at
each other -- what next?

TIMECODE: 00:08:25
Scott's mouth snaps open
IMPOSSIBLY WIDE,
IMPOSSIBLY LARGE--
anda
LOW METALLIC yet
ORGANIC WAIL PROJECTS OUTWARDS
into the room, hurting their ears.

IN RIGHT FRAME: Dr. Tyler is breathing harder and harder,
approaching hyperventilation.

IN LEFT FRAME:

The video image TWISTS, DISTORTS, and ROLLS into nonsensical
bars of chaos.

However this time due to the manipulation of our engineers,
a WARPED, TWISTED IMAGE can be seen, and BARELY DECIPHERED
in the middle portion of the chaos:

TIMECODE: 00:08:41
Through the GRAIN and DISTORTION,
Scott SITS UP TOO FAST, EERILY FAST,
and his head starts to rotate UNNATURALLY to the right, away
from the camera, while his torso remains pointed straight
ahead.
The head is TURNING FARTHER

than a human head should, until he seems to be looking right
at Abbey.

THIS IS NO LONGER SCOTT.

[NOTE: "-------- "means the audio is too distorted to be
deciphered, or unable to be translated by the Sumerian
experts.)

HIS mouth opens again...
..-and a heavily accented METALIC VOICE. speaks forth with:
ALIEN VOICE ALIEN VOICE

(subtitles) Nem r ena nen " ABBEYE TYLEREY.

Paralyzed with fear where she sits, Abbey can say nothing.
Cindy SHRIEKS and can be heard running out of the room.
IN RIGHT FRAME: Dr. Tyler breaks down and cries.

THE REAL DR. TYLER
Oh my God...oh God!

PANICKED, Abbey pushes the chair backwards into the wall
behind her--and through the distortion, we can barely make
out

SCOTT'S body
JITTERING, SPASIMING, UNNATURALLY, VIOLENTLY

as if being jerked around by puppeteer strings from above,
moving like a demonized flesh toy.

IN RIGHT FRAME:

Dr. Tyler SCREAMS and screams. She closes her eyes and locks
away from the moniter.

She's trying to talk, trying to say something, but everything

comes out as a whimper. @

Abbey staggers out of her chair, away from the bed,
practically off screen.

continuing to cry violently.

FADE TO BLACK:

cur To:

IN ABBEY'S BEDROOM

her suitcase is out and she's frantically stuffing clothes
into it as Ronnie and Ashley watch in disbelief. The house
phone rings incessantly.

RONNIE
But where are we going?

ABBEY
North Carolina.

ASHLEY

North Carolina? @
 

RONNIE
What's in North Carolina?
ABBEY
Us by tomorrow.
Ronnie looks at her incredulously -- she's serious.
RONNIE

But I have a game tomorrow!

Abbey points at him.

ABBEY
Pack, your bags.

He can't believe this. The phone stops ringing, then starts
again--he picks it up.

RONNIE
(to phone)
Hello?
ASHLEY
Mommy?
ABBEY

Yes sweetheart.

ASHLEY
What's wrong?

 

ABBEY
Nothing baby, we're just gonna take
a little break. I'1i help you pack
in a second.

RONNIE
(to Abbey)
It's Abel.

ABBEY
T'll call him back.

RONNIE,
(to phone)
She'll call you back.
(listens, to Abbey)
He says he has to talk to you.

ABBEY
(snaps)
I'll call him back!

- RONNIE
@ {to phone)
You heard that.
77
He hangs up.

RONNIE
He's coming over.

 

Abbey sighs, and slams a wad of clothes into another suitcase.

ASHLEY
Are we going to see grandma and
grandpa?

ABBEY
No honey. They're not here anymore,
remember?

ASHLEY

Yeah, they're with daddy. I mean
grandpa and grandma Lilly.

Abbey sighs deeply. The phone rings again.

ABBEY
We're not seeing them either.
ASHLEY
Why not?
ABBEY Pe
‘Cause they don't talk to me anymore. @
ASHLEY
Why?
ABBEY
(snaps)

Go to your room and pack.

ASHLEY
OK.

Ashley turns and fumbles out of the room, Abbey watches her
ge, wishing she hadn't snapped at her.

RONNIE
It's 'cause of Dad, huh?

Abbey doesn't respond as RED and BLUE lights flash through
her window. Ronnie looks outside.

RONNIE
Mom...what. did you do?

AEBEY RUSHES INTO

her living room -- SOMEONE IS FOUNDING on the front door. &
 

 

78

ABBEY
Hold on!

She opens the door, and August charges right in, followed by
THREE DEPUTIES including DEPUTY RYAN[ALIAS], 32, bearded.

August approaches her and launches an assault --

AUGUST
What happened to Scott Stracinsky?

ABBEY
I didn't do anyth--

AUGUST
He's paralyzed from the neck down!
Three of the vertebrate in his neck
are completely severed!

ABBEY
He's para--?
AUGUST
YES goddamn it!
ABBEY
I don't know--I don't know--
AUGUST
You were there-- tell me what
happened!
ABBEY

But it wasn't--he was saying things.
He was saying--he was--

AUGUST
How'd he brake his back?

ABBEY
I can't explain it--it's--

AUGUST
You'll explain it NOW!

ABBEY
S--Something was inside of him, and--
and it twisted his body--an-and that's
probably what did it. It was--it
Was--

She's at a loss for words...

August is very still, very rational -- but his eyes are firing
into her like the bullets of an Ax-47.
79

AUGUST
(quietly)
Something was inside of him. It
twisted his body.

It takes her a moment to answer--

ABBEY
(pained)
Yes.

AUGUST
And you have proof of this.

ABBEY
It didn't record, it's all distorted--

The rage drains from August...

AUGUST
Abbey...how the hell do you expect
me...

..and is replaced by sorrow...

AUGUST
..-how in God's name am I supposed
to believe this?

ABBEY
I know what I saw...

AUGUST

I know you just lost Will, and I'm
sorry about Ashley--my heart goes
out to you-- it does. But you have
to understand that what you're doing
is hurting people, Aorribly. It's
time you face the reality at hand.
Know I don't want to do this, but
you've forced us to this situation.

August moves, putting his hands on her.

ABBEY
What?

As he turns her around and begins tc handcuff her.

AUGUST
You have the right to remain silent.

ABBEY
What are you doing?

 

 
 

 

AUGUST
Anything you say or do can and will
be used against you in a court of
law.

The deputies move towards her.

ABBEY
Sheriff... August...
AUGUST
You have the right to an attorney
ABBEY
Please.
AUGUST

Tf you can't afford an attorney, one -
will be appointed for you.

ABBEY
You can't take me away from my
children.
(begs)
August...
CAMPOS (0.S.)
August!

Campos hurries into the room, panting, out of breath.

steps up to the Sheriff.

CAMPOS
I know what it looks like--but I was
there, saw it with my own eyes.

AUGUST
Saw what?

CAMPOS
He-~he--Scott--

80

He

Campos can't find words that make sense, he looks at Abbey

then back at August.

AUGUST
(to deputies--no
patience)
Get him out of my sight.

The deputies grab Campos and pull him back.

CAMPOS
I watched you grow up with her--both
of you, in this town--together. You
knew her father--you know her family!
(MORB)
CAMPOS (CONT'D)
She committed no physical harm to
that man--never touched him! She's
not capable of it!

 

AUGUST
T don't know what--
CAMPOS
You know her! You know she couldn't!

What's happening in Nome is terrifying--
I know it is--But whatever you do,

you can't--you can net arrest her
because of something you don't
understand--because your terrified!

AUGUST
Goddamn it man--!

CAMPOS
You're taking her from her children!
For their sake, leave her be!

August looks from Ronnie to Ashley -- seeing them for the
first time. He runs a hand through his hair -- it shakes
betraying nerves, indecision.
ABBEY os
Please... @.
CAMPOS
Don't do it.
AUGUST

(sighs)
I'm putting you under house arrest.
(a breath, not meeting
her eyes)
You'll be under twenty-four hour
supervision and aren't allowed to
leave these premises. Campos, you're
coming with me.

August grabs Campos by the arm and strides out of the house
with his deputies, leaving Abbey and her children alone.

Ronnie looks at her as if she were mad, he's at a complete
loss for words.

ASHLEY
Mommy? Are you OK?

FADE IN TEXT -- THE VOICE OF DR. TYLER
 

 

 

THE REAL DR. TYLER {V.0.)
(shaky)
Sometimes...when I care for a
patient...I realize they're different
from all the others...

CcuT TO:

OUTSIDE ABBEY'S HOUSE
the cop trucks crush snow as they drive away from the house.

THE REAL DR. TYLER (V.O.)
It's a...it's a shock every time--as
if I'm seeing it for the first time...

A ways down the road, DEPUTY RYAN'S COP TRUCK makes a U-Turn
away from the other trucks, and pulis off to the side of the
road, facing Abbey's house.

IN DEPUTY RYAN'S COP TRUCK.

Deputy Ryan turns off his truck, from here he can see her
entire house with ease. He grabs his radio mic.

RYAN
This is Ryan sir, I'm stationed in
front of the Tyler home.

AUGUST (on radio)
Roger that, you're out there ail
night Ryan.

Ryan sighs.

AUGUST (on radio)
She so much as opens that front door,
you arrest her. And don't request
anything from her. Order it. Clear?

RYAN
Copy that, sir.

CUT TO:

THE INTERVIEW ROOM.

Abbey's eyes are blcodshot, tears rimming the bottom of each
eye. Her cheeks are puffy and red.

THE REAL DR. TYLER
...You see it in their eyes, in their
mannerisms. You can tell by what
they're saying, that something isn't
right.

(MORE)
83

THE REAL DR. TYLER (CONT'D)

(pauses)
And then all of a sudden you realize
that the person sitting across from
you is insane.

(breath)
I became that person...to everyone
else--they thought--they think I'm
insane. And the thing is...how can
I blame them? What I'm saying is--
is...I wish I had made it all up.
Because at least that way, I could
walk away--with all che things that
I lost--

(she grows more

emotional)
--and I could continue to live my
life...but I can't.

(quietly)
‘Cause...'cause, I didn't make up
any of it.

Olacunde nods, understanding.
FADE IN LEFT SPLIT/SCREEN, UPPER & LOWER FRAME

THRE REAL DR. TYLER
And...then uk...Campos and Awolowa
were both questioned...by August...

LEFT LOWER FRAME: August questions Awolowa, who glares at
the Sheriff.

LEFT UPPER FRAME: August interrogates Campos, towering over
him as he verbally attacks him.

IN RIGHT FRAME:

THE REAL DR. TYLER
Campos reminded him about the
disappearances, and--~

OLATUNDE
What about them?

THE REAL DR, TYLER
Homicides, missing people, dozens of
them. It's been going on here since
the 1960's and the FBI has been
drepping in from time to time.

CLATUNDE
What did they find?

THE REAL DR. TYLER
Nothing...it's inconclusive. To
this day nothing's been sclved.

 

 
 

 

OLATUNDE
You mentioned the situation dated
back some time, 1960's, that's forty
years.

THE REAL DR. TYLER
...there's a lot of government
activity up here...I mean, they had
a couple of Blue Bock cases back
then toc...

Olatunde is writing all of this down.

OLATUNDE
What do you think all this means?
How do you put it in perspective?

THE REAL DR. TYLER
They have categories for these types
of things--different levels--

OLATUNDE
--Explain...

THE REAL DR. TYLER
An encounter of the First
Kind...that's when you see a UFO.
The Second Kind? It’s when you see
evidence of it, crop circles--
radiation...Third Kind is when you
see an alien. But the Fourth
Kind...there's nothing more
frightening than the Fourth...you
see, that one's when they abduct
you.

She looks at Olatunde hard.

THE REAL DR. TYLER

I think it's ail part of the same
thing, it's all connected...to Will--
the missing pecple--to everything in
Nome.

(her mouth twitches)
You see...this kind of thing...what's
happening to Nome--to me?... I think
it's happening to other people...not
just there...but all over the
world...in towns, cities--most of
them don't even know it.

 

OLATUNDE
Know they're abducted?

THE REAL DR. TYLER
How could they kncw?
(MORE)

B84
85

THE REAL DR. TYLER (CONT'D)

How could they remember what they're
being forced to forget? Unless
they had help.

(forceful)
And I tried to give that help to as
many people as I could--no matter
what they say about me--I tried and
maybe failed, but I did try.

This floats in the air a couple seconds.

OLATUNDE
So what happened with the Sheriff's
interview of Campos and Awolowa?

THE REAL DR. TYLER
August told them to stay away from
me--and I told them to go back home~-
so I wouldn‘t...drag them into this
any further but...they--uh--they
told me they weren't leaving until
they were sure I was alright. But
that night just got worse...

CUT TO BLACK:
FADE IN:
3:33 AM
is the time on Deputy Ryan's dashboard as he snores.
And then he wakes up.

For a moment he stares straight ahead, and then he starts
looking around frantically as if he missed something, but
there's nothing.

He rubs his head and sets his head back against the headrest --
at that moment he see's it, just under his rear view mirror,
out the window, and above Abbey's home.

RYAN
What the hell?

IN FRONT OF ABBEY'S HOUSE, LATER.

Four patrol trucks with their sirens BLAZING arrive,
surrounding a deeply shaken Deputy Ryan. Sheriff August
steps from one of the trucks. *

 

AUGUST
Where are they?

RYAN
I-I-I don't know--I tried t-to tell
you--

August doesn't break stride, hurrying towards the house.

Sir, it didn't record, it--it did
but nothing came out--

Ah--bullshit! C'MON!

with his OFFICERS in tow, and RUSHES past the rooms till he
see's Abbey in

ASHLEY'S ROOM
and enters.

Ronnie and Abbey are the only ones in here. Abbey is on the
floor crying and Ronnie's trying to calm her down. Chaos
pours from her mouth.

AUGUST
What the hell happened?

ABBEY
They took my baby.

RONNIE
Mom shhhhh! Mom!

AUGUST
Where's Ashley?

Abbey points upwards.

ABBEY
They took her.

RONNIE
Stop it!

AUGUST
(to Ronnie)
What's she talking about?

RONNIE
Someone kidnapped Ashley.

AUGUST
(to radio)
I want this entire house searched, I
want everybody outside, inside, going
through this residence top to bottom.
(to Ronnie)
What the hell did you see?

RONNIE
Nothing, I came in here and she was
gone.

ABBEY

She's not here! Thay tock her!--
they tock her into the sky--up there!
I saw it!

AUGUST
Through the ceiling?

ABBEY RONNIE
Yeess! A beam of light (desperate)
came down and--and-- Mom! Why are you saying
pulled her up--oh my this?
God!

AUGUST

What the hell are you saying?

ABBEY RONNIE
I saw it! It reached (desperate)
down and grabbed her! Stop it! Please stop!

It took my baby! TI

Alright clear the room! Everyone

(to Ronnie)
You too.
RONNIE
Why--?
AUGUST
Out!
ABBEY
He doesn't leave my sight!
AUGUST
I need you alone!
ABBEY
I'm his mother--he's not leaving my

sight!

The deputies leave the room leaving the three of them alone.
August slams the door.

Sniffling, Abbey sits on Ashley's bed. August spins a chair
backwards and sits on it, his face less than two feet from
hers. Ronnie looks between the two of them.

AUGUST
Less than five hours after I arrest
you, your daughter goes missing.

ABBEY
You gonna arrest me again?

AUGUST

Where is she?

He stands and SLAMS the chair down.

AUGUST
Where is she goddamn it!
ABBEY
I don't know--!
AUGUST

What did you do with her?
(to Ronnie)
Where's your sister?

@ ABBEY
Don't yell at him!
AUGUST
(to Abbey)
Where is she--WHERE IS SHE!
He hurls the chair behind him -- it splinters into the wall

and bounces back out of shape--

AUGUST

GOD DAMN IT! WHERE THE HELL IS SHE???
ABBEY

I--I told you!
RONNIE

(to Abbey)

Why are you saying this?
ABBEY

Honey--I'm not-- I'm not--
RONNIE

What's wrong with you?) What happened

to you!

@ ABBEY
Baby...
That hit her harder than ever.

ABBEY @

Breathing hard, seething air between his teeth.

Baby--I...

AUGUST
You haven't been right in the head
since will.

ABBEY
You haven't found the killer--

AUGUST
No Abbey...we did--

ABBEY
--he's still out there-~!

AUGUST
--and you know I speak the truth.
There's a thin line between reality
and fiction, and you've crossed over
to the wrong side.

August nods at Ronnie.

AUGUST
I'm removing him from your custody.

 

ABBEY
You are not taking my son.

AUGUST
I am. And come tomorrow morning,
for your sake Abbey, have a lawyer
present. That's how we're doing it
from here on in.

Abbey rushes over to Ronnie and grabs onto his arm.
AUGUST (to radio)
Guys get in here, we're removing

Ronnie from Abbey's custody.

The door bursts open and the DEPUTIES rush in, swarming around
Abbey and Ronnie.

ABBEY
NO!

They try and separate her from her son but she is not letting
go!

RONNIE
(to Abbey)
Let me go! Let go!
ABBEY
No!
RONNIE

Mom! Let go--~-let go of me!

struggle to know avail.

IN THE RIGHT FRAME: THE REAL DR. TYLER'S face glistens with
tears and her mouth twitches.

THE REAL DR. TYLER (V.O.)
I was alone...completely alone. I
can't describe how that felt. What
that experience is like. To have
your kids ripped away from you.
Ashley without any explanation...and
then Ronnie just not wanting anything
to do with me. Going with the police
of his own free will. The kind cf
pain that creates, it just--it stays
there and just gets stronger.

She cries for a mcment in silence.

OLATUNDE
So...What did you do next?
94

IN THE LEFT FRAME:
Narrative Abbey rises to her feet.
IN THE RIGHT FRAME:

THE REAL DR. TYLER
I realized...that they weren't going
to be able to find her...that I would
have to do it on my own.

CLATUNDE
But you couldn't leave.

THE REAL DR. TYLER
That's not what I mean, I had to...to
find a way to go directly to the
them...directly to the source.

OLATUNDE
Who's them?

She pauses for a moment, carefully looking at him.

THE REAL DR. TYLER
Whoever took my daughter.

OLATUNDE
How... ?

IN THE LEFT FRAME: She paces around Ashley's room.
CUT TO:

RONNIE'S ROOM.
IN THE LEFT FRAME: She paces back and forth next to his bed.
IN THE RIGHT FRAME:

THE REAL DR. TYLER
...figure out-- I had to try and--
and determine where they might have
taken her...by figuring cut where
they took me.

OLATUNDE
You mean hypnotize yourself, and go
back to the night they tcok her?

THE REAL DR. TYLER
(shakes her head)
No-- the night they abducted me,
when it got recorded on my tape
recorder--

 
 

ma:
e

OLATUNDE
--Right.
THE REAL DR. TYLER

If I could figure out where they
took me...then maybe--

OLATUNDE
--you could figure out where they
took her.

The corner of her mouth twitches.

THE REAL DR. TYLER
...and find a way to communicate
with them, talk to them.

Talk to...whoever took Ashley?

THE REAL DR. TYLER
Yes.

OLATUNDE
...and how?

IN THE LEFT FRAME: Abbey walks into her study and sits down
at her desk.

IN THE RIGHT FRAME:

THE REAL DR. TYLER
I had already seen it done--with
Scott. They can communicate with
you when you go under hypnosis.

OLATUNDE
You were going to try and initiate
this on purpose?

THE REAL DR. TYLER
Exactly.

CLATUNDE
And you knew at the time that Scott
was paralyzed?
THE REAL DR. TYLER
I knew I'd do anything for my
daughter. For one of the two things
I really love in this world.

Clatunde nods.
IN THE LEFT FRAME:
Abbey picks up the phone, dials and starts talking.

She's slumped in her seat, and her head is hanging to the
side.

The CAMERA BARELY KEEPS HER FRAMED, allowing too much
headroom.

CAMPOS (0.S.}
Abbey.

ABBEY

 

SS Yes...
CAMPOS

Let's go back three days...to
Tuesday...when you were giving
dictation in your bedroom....

ABBEY
Yes...

CAMPOS
What happened after you finished
your dictation?
ABBEY
',..remains unexplained...and worse,
unsolved...Like Will...and...'
She trails off into nothing...

CAMPOS
Are you sleeping?

ABBEY
1. yes...

TIMECODE: 00:9:20

@ CAMPOS

What happened next?

Her head slowly, quietly, rolls groggily to the right...

ABBEY
...The owl...it's looking down at
me...

CAMPOS
Is this the same owl your patients
see?

ABBEY
«.-yes...but it's...... smiling...

(rising panic)
.--I don't like when it smiles...

CAMPOS
What do you mean, 'smiling'?

ABBEY
I don't know what I mean...I don't
want to know...

nn CAMPOS
@ It's too late to forget what you
already know. Tell me what you see.
98

Her lips tighten, a part of her unwilling to part with her
next words--

 

ABBEY
(whispers)
It's not an owl...

Abbey's eyes gradually open...looking hard at something we
can't see above her and she starts to whimper, starts to cry--
as fear melts her features.

ABBEY
Oh God...God--

CAMPOS
Relax, we're here, it's OK. None of
this is happening right now.

ABBEY CAMPOS
GOOOOODDD HELP (tries to talk over
MEEEEEEEE!!!! MAMA! her
MAMA! MAAAMAAAA!! 11! Abbey! Detach the emotion!
AIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII It's not happening right
IIIIIIiIIIII1! now--
AIITIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII

ABBEY ,
~-aaaaaAAAAAAHHHH! ! ! @.

Abbey SLAMS HER BODY

back into the chair and goes rigid, her face screwing up as
if something were pushing on her, SMOTHERING her body with
an immeasurable amount of pressure.

She exerts quick rapid breaths, trying to breath. Campos
watches her helplessly.

CAMPOS
What are they doing to you?

ABBEY
(clenched teeth)
--Taking me out~- up-~ up--
(desperation)
God I'm so high, I'm so-- it's not
stopping-- it's not safe-~AHHHHHH!

She lifts her back out of the chair, then COLLAPSES back
into it as if whatever vehicle she thinks she's in stopped.

Eyes closed, her head is making jerky movements to the left
and right as if it took great effort to move it.
 

99

CAMPOS
Keep talking to me-- keep talking--
what do you see?

Her arms raise into the air, and with the motor skills of
someone who appears drugged, she seems to be swatting
something away. Her face is contorted into a flesh mask of
fear.

ABBEY
(silent tears)
What are you...? What are you doing
to me...?

CAMPOS
Who are you talking to?

ABBEY
The things...the--the--people,
operating on me--I'm on a table.

CAMPOS
People? Like you and I?

ABBEY
No--they don't look like you...they
don't look-~- they're not from
here...not human--No!

She keeps swatting at thin air, trying to get something away
from her.

ABBEY
They're all around me-- too many of
them--their minds--it hurts--ahhhh.

Suddenly her body goes STIFF, her head snaps back into the
headrest--her arms slam down, and her

LEGS spread OPEN.

ABBEY
Oh God! Nonononono stop it
Pleeeeease! Don't let it-- don't
let it--

She squirms as if restrained, trying to twist back further
up the chair, her eyes are focused down at her crotch.

ABBEY
--Ahhhhgg! They're putting it in me--
(high pitched)
It hurts--oh God!

CAMPOS
What is it?
 

ABBEY
(shrieks) v
A metal thing--! pe
CAMPOS
What are they doing--
ABBEY
--th-they're in my
womb...oh....God...!
She starts
CONVULSING,
seizure like-- in obvious PAIN, then her entire body goes
limp.
CAMPOS
Abbey...
(no response)
Abbey...?
Campos reaches towards her...
...The video image begins to TWIST--BEND-
TIMECODE: 00:11:20 os
Abbey jerks VIOLENTLY and a CRACKING is heard as her back @

bends UNNATURALLY over the back of the chair, hiding her
face from view as she FLOPS WILDLY as if in a SEIZURE.

The camera is EXTREMELY SHAKY as it follows this.
ABBEY
(LOW, ELECTRONIC)
AHHHHHHHHHHEHHHHHHHHEIIITIIIIIIII.

This voice is vocalizing from Abbey, but DOES NOT BELONG TO
HER.

The VIDEO COMPLETELY DISTORTS,

bars of nonsense ROILING INCOHERENTLY. Nothing visual can
be deciphered.

She talks now, vacillating between her NORMAL VOICE and this
other, nominally DEMONIC VOICE channeling through her--as if
she were having a conversation with herself.

DEAD SILENCE RULES.

Our IMAGE CLEARS UP, the DISTORTION IS GONE...giving us a
perfect view of a room that looks like

A TORNADO
walked though it.
COUCHES at odd angles, CHAIRS against the walls, BOOKS on
the floor, but NOTHING is near the window--almost as if
something CLEARED that area away.
NO ONE is in THERE now--
not Awolowa, not Campos, not Abbey.
The tape rolls for some time...and then...
CUT TO BLACK:
FADE IN:
THE INTERVIEW ROOM.

Dr. Tyler is speechless, not breathing as her mouth twitches
uncontrollably. Behind her the monitors are black.

CLATUNDE
What the hell happened in that room?
104

THE REAL DR. TYLER
...they came...and we were-- we .
were... @

Now her whole face is twitching, her left eye blinking with
every movement.

THE REAL DR. TYLER
...They abducted us, all of us-- but
eventually brought us back, but we
don't remember where they took us--
even with hypnosis it's black--

The twitch has become a tremble, making it difficult for her
to form her words.

OLATUNDE
Are you OK? Do you need a break?

THE REAL DR. TYLER
No, I'm fine.

Dr. Tyler takes a couple of breaths, steadying herself.

OLATUNDE
Why would...another entity not from
this world do these things? Help us
understand the reasoning behind it.

 

THE REAL DR. TYLER
God I don't know--how can we know?
If humans can mystify other humans...
on a daily basis...then-~-I--I think
we can conclude that something from
another world...can mystify us as
well.

The import of her statement hovers in the air.
CLATUNDE
You're voice--it's voice...it said
it was...God...
Dr. Tyler's face twitches--doesn't respond.
OLATUNDE
What do you believe...? Are
they...was it...God...?

She can't meet his eyes...eyes that have something terrible
welling within them--scomething worth hiding.

THE REAL DR. TYLER
...I pelieve...I don't know what I

believe...the things I've seen...the
presence...i felt inside of me...is &

(MCRE)

   
 

 

THE REAL DR. TYLER (CONT'D)
beyond anything we can imagine...and
God...if that were God--what God
is...then he is.........
hopelessness...it cannot be God...it
can't be....

OLATUNDE
And what about Ashley?

THE REAL DR. TYLER
(shakes her head)

She...I had to recover from that
night...took me a couple days to
wake up--and as you know I-I was
changed forever. August couldn't
bring me into the station so he...he
came to me.

She looks down at the table...not wanting to say these next
few words.

THE REAL DR. TYLER
...he talked to me about Ashley...and
about Will.

CUT TO:

IN A NOME HOSPITAL ROOM.

Abbey sits in bed...her back against the headboard...her
hair stringy, moist, unkempt. She's lost too much
weight...bone is pressing against her skin...an empty shell
of a once strong, healthy woman.

Her body is very still, unmoving.
August sits in a chair next to her, a MANILA FOLDER in hand.
AUGUST
I hate to ask you these questions--
now, while you're in this condition
your in--but this is one of those
things in life that can't wait.

Abbey nods weakly, quietly.

AUGUST
Abbey. What happened to your
daughter?

ABBEY

(quietly, weakly)
I told you...
AUGUST
What you told me and what actually
happened are two different things.

ABBEY
No--they're the same.

AUGUST
OK...you want to play this game?

ABBEY
It's not a game-~

AUGUST
How did Will die?

She hesitates, pulls back-~stunned by the question.

AUGUST
C'mon....Answer it.

ABBEY
He was murdered.

AUGUST
No Abbey. What you're telling me
and what happened are two different
things. Now one more time: How did
Will die?

Her eyes are darting around...she's breathing harder...her
skin is losing it's color...panic is welling in her throat.

ABBEY
Why are you asking me this?

AUGUST
(yells)
Campos! Get in here!

A deputy opens the door and Campos walks in, circles to the
other side of the bed and kneels next to Abbey.

ABBEY
What is this?

CAMPOS
Tr's OK...1t's OK...

AUGUST
No it's not OK. We're getting to
the bottom of everything now. Again:
How did your husband die?

ABBEY
I teld you, an intruder entered our
house and killed him.

 
 

 

 

107

August and Campos exchange looks.

CAMPOS
He's going to show you something
that will upset you. But it has to
be done, understand?

She doesn't understand. With what strength she has left,
she looks at Campos hard.

August opens his file...and holds up
a PHOTO
for her to see...

She gasps--half SCREAMS, doesn't have the strength to scream
again--her face is a perfect mask of revulsion, of
tears...anguish.

ABBEY
-why...?

THE PHOTC is of WILL TYLER--with a BLOODY HOLE in the side
of his head the size of a GRAPEFRUIT.

AUGUST
This is the head of a man--

He holds up a SECOND PHOTO, this one of a 9mm PISTOL.

AUGUST
--who used this gun, to blow his own
brains out.

Abbey can't stop sobbing--her eyes are closed, her head turned
away--whimpering. Campos is caressing her face, almost
protecting it from the photos.

CAMPOS
I'm sorry...

August shakes the photos for emphasis.

AUGUST
This is how you do it--and he did it
right. Suicide Abbey. That's how
your husband died.

ABBEY

AUGUST
He took a pistol and shot himself in
the head--there was no knife, no
der--just him and his own gun
edge of your bed.

int

  

at
ABBEY
--he's not that man--he wouldn't do
that to us, to his family--

AUGUST
--I've seen it before, I'll see it
again--
ABBEY
(to Campos)

Tell him...tell him he's wrong. I
would have known he was gonna--I'm a
psychiatrist---Christ----I would
have known--!

Campos holds her close, trying to comfort her.

CAMPOS
You can't blame yourself for what
was going on in his head. Who knows
what he learned, what he didn't
share...what finally broke him--

ABBEY
No...no...

CAMPOS
Sometimes the closest signs, the
ones closest to us, are the hardest
to read.

AUGUST
(to Abbey)
Now you know the reality.

August puts the photos down...and leans in.

AUGUST
And for the last time. Tell me what
happened to Ashley.

She can't answer.

AUGUST
Tell me.

CAMPOS
You have to tell him...for Ashley.

Tears wetting her cheeks, she pulls away from Campos and
looks at him...softly.

ABBEY
You know what happened. You
experienced it. Except we came
back...she didn't.

 

 
Campos! eyes lock on hers...and then they give in, looking
down to the bed. He can't refute her words...not after what
he's seen. Not after what they've been through.

 

ABBEY
(to August)
I swear to you--I swear it. She was
taken, by-by something. ..something
not from here....... I swear it....

August looks between the two of them, his face like a bull
ready to charge--but unsure which bulls eye to hit first.

AUGUST
(then quietly)
It's difficult to go back.

He arranges the pictures and closes the files just so.

CAMPOS
Go back?

August takes his time, doesn't rush it.

AUGUST
Back over the line, from fiction to
reality. You can't just stop being
insane whenever you want to. It's
@ the kind of thing that stays with
you forever.

 

CUT TO:

THE INTERVIEW ROOM.
Abbey is quiet...lost in the memory.

OLATUNDE
So Will committed suicide?

...the kind of thing one would not want to admit...would not
want to say out loud...but she does--

THE REAL DR. TYLER
-yes.

OLATUNDE
Your credibility....How do ycu expect
me-- the audience-- to believe
anything you have to say, after you
were hallucinating the murder of
your husband?

THE REAL DR. TYLER
~ They weren't hallucinations--I just
@ couldn't--it can be difficult to
(MORE)
THE REAL DR. TYLER {CONT'D)
face the truth, and with Will, that's
how I dealt with it. And .no matter
what you believe, the recordings do
not jie You can doubt my words--
you would doubt me even if I were a
saint, I mean we're talking about
things that--that aren't normal--but
what you cannot doubt are the
recordings--t-the other people--their
stories. [name removed] is dead
[mame removed] back is broken-- a-
and Ashley...she's still gone. These
are hard facts.

   

OLATUNDE
They appear to be--

THE REAL DR. TYLER
(twitches)
i THEY ARE. You can

sit there and speculate but I have
to keep hope alive...I have to believe
in what were doing--this film--my
story~--that it will help. TI have to
believe she's still alive somewhere,
that she's safe...that there's a
chance I'm going to see her again-- >
hold her again-- @

(starts to cry) *
--hear her voice...I--I just want my
little girl back! She's all I have.
I can't bring back Will, Ronnie he--
he--he--blames me for everything--he
shut me out of kis life! Mothers
shouldn't be alone. We shouldn't be
without our children...

(desperate)
I just want my baby back...I just
want her back...

Tears glisten off her cheeks as her face continues to twitch,
but she's somehow holding it together, somehow preventing
the complete emotional collapse you'd expect.

OLATUNDE
I think we can stop here.

The camera's slowly zcom out in farewell...and for the first
time we see that Dr. Tyler is in a WHEELCHAIR with ARMS and
LEGS so WITHERED away, they don't look like they've moved in
years...

CUT TO:
@

STILL IMAGES
of the TYLER FAMILY dance across the screen.

OLATUNDE (V.O.)
With no credible evidence, kidnapping
charges against Dr. Tyler were
dropped. Her daughter Ashley has
not been found.

An image of ASHLEY SMILING zooms towards us, it morphs into
an OLDER VERSION of her -- approximately 7 years older.

OLATUNDE (V.0O.)
If you have any information about
Ashley Tyler that may assist local
authorities please call toll-free 1-
800-MISSING.

TITLE: 1-800-MISSING
DISSOLVE TO:
ON A HILL OVERLOOKING NOME,
Olatunde stands, looking directly at us.

OLATUNDE
Someone else is interested in Nome
as well. Since the 1960's, there
have been over 2,000 visits to Nome
by the Federal Bureau of Investigation --
the highest in Alaska. Second is
Anchorage, with a population 76 times
larger than Nome. The FBI has paid
them only 353 visits.

The camera begins craning back, bidding us adieu.
OLATUNDE
In the end...what you believe, is
yours to decide.

CUT TO BLACK:

THE END
Psychiatrist released
from custody, child

not found.

By Kate Ripple
Fairbanks Daily News

Nome, Alaska ~ The only susp- j
ect in the disappearance of 5 year
old Ashley Tyler was teleased fr- |
om custody yesterday, with all c-
harges dropped after spending 2
montis under house arrest for her
daughters disappearance on the m--
oming of October 10".

“We’ ve got nothing on her, and
we haven’t found the girl,” chief
Moates said. Asked. if he believ-
ed Dr, Tyler was.guilty, he stopp-
éd short of saying she was innoce-
nt, “There's #6 motive, no evide-

“nce, ahd no girl. On paper there's
no reason she should have kidnap-
ped her own daughter. But she’s
nat here, and we have no idea w-
here the hell she is.”

Reports speculate that Ashley's |
disappearance could be related to;
the hundreds of people who have
disappeared in the city, which has
cases going back to 1960 and occ-
urting as recently as last month.
Most of Nome’s missing person
cases have gone unsolved, as have
most missing person cases throug-
hout Alaska due to the severity of
the land.
