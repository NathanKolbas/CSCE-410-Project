Steve walks out of the office. Chief Roman watches him go --

We linger, long enough to get a look at the stand-up FRAMED

A T.V. SCREEN

A BOY, 18, long hair, hoop earring, N.W.A. t-shirt, walks
through the house carrying two Cokes. He sees the CAMERA. The
IMAGE is shaky, hand-held, home-movieish. The boy is ALLEN
CLARK. He’s handsome, alive, toe cool for school and rules.

ALLEN
Hey, what are you doing, dipshit?

We HEAR Steve’s VOICE. He is running the camera: --

Around the caf. The cliques Gavin documented all those pages

across the hoiler room, in something of a docile TRANCE.

He stands there. Gazing dolefully at the banded steel belly of
the boilers... Eyes blank. -Expressicn slack.

Rachel takes one last lock and, still clutching the videotape,
flees the basement...

Newberry steps out from his hiding spot. He’s seen the whole
thing. He walks over to the glazed Chug. Waves a hand over
Chug‘s face. Nothing.

And something catches Newberry’s eye:

A BLACK BOX

about the size of a portable television set. Tethered to a
cangle of sipes behind the boilers --

A RED LIGHT on the box’s face glows intermittently -- a
nigh-pitched, barely-discernible squeal accompanies the glow.

Newberry approaches the box... Rubs at nis whiskered chin...

As elegant as it is outside, the inside is a shabby mess: dirty
sheets cover the furniture; the walls are rotting plaster. The

Trash is strewn about the floors, providing ample amusement for
the dozen or so CATS that roam about.

EXT. CRADLE BAY HIGH - FIELD HOUSE - DAY

The field house overlooks the various playing fields surrounding
the high school. Two BOYS -- Dickie Atkinson and another BLUE
RIBBON, toss a baseball nearby...

INT.. FIELD HOUSE - DAY

Filthy windows overlook the field. The field house is crowded
with lawn mowers, gardening tools, rusted tackling dummies.

Steve is here. With Dorian Newberry. And Newberry has a BLACK

_BOX.- like the one in the basement - on his work bench...

STEVE
What is that thing?

NEWBERRY
Sound generator. Emits high frequency
sound waves that are supposed to
control rats. Some jokers sold a bunch
of ‘em to the town council a few years
back -- on account of the rats from the
Bay had become a problem...

Newberry spins the knob on the face of the box. An
ear-splitting FREQUENCY HUM shrieks stridently...

Steve, startled, backs into a shelf, knocking over a jar of
penny nails...

Newberry reaches out and tweaks the knob, killing the noise:

Dickie and the boy come out of their trance. - They stare at
Newberry and Steve, confused, blinking, disoriented...

DICKIE ATKINSON
Hello, shit-for-brains...

They giggle cruelly and walk away from the field house. Resume
their catch.

Newberry and Steve watch them go. They regard the black box.
INT. CRADLE BAY HIGH - DAY

Steve walks by himself. PECPLE pass him, wearing those smiles.
Some of the ARCHETYPES Gavin pointed out in his caf speech (a
skater; a hippy, etc.) are now clad in cardigans and goofy

Allen couldn’ t take it anymore. All
the people angling to break them up.
So they planned to run away. Go to
California or something. The plan. was
co meet at this playground by school.
And take off. Abbey was going to tell
her parents, even though Allen never
told mine. But she wanted to make a
clean break. So she told ‘em. And
they freaked. And locked her in her
room. And Abbey’s brother - this
shitball named Frank - he drove to the
playground. And Frank told Allen that
Abbey wasn’t coming. That she decided
to stay. But he should go on himself.
Allen freaked out. He couldn’: believe
it. He sat at that playground for
hours. Till it got dark. Till the
bottle of Jack Daniels was drained.
And then he did it. He had a gun. 1
don‘t know from where. And he shot
himself. And Abbey finally forced her
way out of her house. And made it to
the playground. And she found him.

splendid thing; that this was, in

CALDICOTT (CONT. )
I, myself, was a peaceful man, working
at a university in Boston, studying
pharmacotherapy and its applications in
areas of neurology. I had a beautiful
daughter, who was troubled. Tempted by
the wicked vagaries of adolescence. In
working with her, in helping her to
come through it, unscathed, I
discovered the great resource that is
the human mind. That is the pillar of
higher wisdom we need to support
healthy, rich lives...

something in her hand...

And it is A PISTOL - a snub-nosed .22 caliber automatic... She
raises it, puts it under her chin... BLAM! .Abbey’s face is a
smudge of pulp...
ALLEN
Sweet Iseult. Sweet Iseult has become
face pizza...

Allen turns to Steve/Us... He puts the gun under his own chin...
He howls, gleeful:

BLAM! Allen shoots himself...

Blood everywhere. Brain tissue and gray matter spattered about
the walls and posters like a grisly Jackson Pollock.

Hey, dude. Go forward --
It becomes dark... Hazy... A phantom diorama... Faces come at us
from the dark... Ghoulish, gristle-encrusted faces... Faces that

have been pulverized by bullets...
Abbey’s face... Broken, gooey teeth... Excoriated flesh...

Allen's face... Blackened... A foul miasma... They try to speak
through the thick sludgy remnants of their tongues:

ABBEY
Meet the musical little creatures that
hide among the flowers -- |

And they begin to GIGGLE, high and sweet and scary as hell,
their shattered mouths barely able to contain their drool...

And, as Allen RAISES THE PISTOL, its bore glistening with gore,
and he AIMS IT AT US, pulling the hammer back --

-- there is a CRACKLZ of STATIC, Of SNOW. And the horror-Allen
is momentarily replaced by the live Allen, who says:
