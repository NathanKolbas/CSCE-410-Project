FADE IN:
MAIN TITLE SEQUENCE
Titles begin to play over a black screen.

Suddenly the screen is filled with color! An intense,
glowing orange.

Electronic. Flickering. A TV screen.
The sound of clicking, clattering computer keyboards.

A black dot appears in the field of orange, then
another and another. These build into the shape

of a triangle.
TITLES CONTINUE.

CAMERA SLOWLY DOLLIES BACK.

Another black triangle appears: ‘beside the first.

‘Ey es.

The face of a_jack-o-lantern is being electronically
"carve into the field of orange.

The triangular nose, the jagged smile...

The pumpkin shape reverses and rearranges itself on
the monitor screen, distorting, enlarging, shrinking,
strobing, filling the screen.

dramatic shots of Stonehenge.

..-leaving British authorities still
baffled and. without any substantial
clues nine months after the theft...
the Bluestone was one of nineteen,
believed to represent the nineteen-
year cycle of the moon. It weighs
more than five tons, making its
disappearance a mystery indeed...

PULL BACK to reveal a clean little gas station. The
ATTENDANT, JONES, a black man in his forties, sits
comfortably at his desk, feet propped up, his nose
buried in a boxing magazine.

Outside, the rain comes down in sheets.

Then, the bright, happy sound of a commercial. Jones
glances at the set.
 

 

CLOSEUP - TV SCREEN 4

A logo spirals out of the video depths and fills the
screen:

SILVER SHAMROCK
Jolly voices begin to sing:
SHAMROCK VOICES*

EIGHT MORE DAYS TO HALLOWEEN,

HALLOWEEN, HALLOWEEN;

EIGHT MORE DAYS TO HALLOWEEN,

SIL----VER--~--SHAMROCK! !!
Colorful masks and smiling children spiral onto the
screen and dance merrily about: A WITCH, a PUMPKIN
and a SKULL.
BACK TO SCENE 5
Jones turns back to his magazine. A SHAMROCK VOICE
yammers about “horrificly beautiful masks at low,
low prices..."
In the pouring rain outside, something moves. A
FIGURE separates itself from the background and heads
toward the station.
EXT. /INT. GAS STATION - LOW ANGLE (PANAGLIDE) 6
The man's foot splashes hugely into frame! He
staggers doggedly past the gas pumps, gasping for
breath. WE FOLLOW.

Something dangles from his hand; he drops it. It is
a Halloween mask. An orange. pumpkin.

The man staggers forward and falls against the station
door.
INT. ON JONES 7

The attendant turns, startled.

* to the tune of "London Bridge Is Falling Down"

INT./EXT. THROUGH GLASS ONTO GRIMBRIDGE 8

The man outside (whose name is GRIMBRIDGE) has his
face pressed tight against the glass; it is a study
in terror and exhaustion. His gray hair is matted.
His eyes are wild.

Jones opens the door and Grimbridge collapses inward.
Jones helps him to the floor.

JONES
Jesus Christ, man! What happened?

Grimbridge stares up at the attendant helplessly.
He is emaciated. A week's growth of beard, a cut on
his cheek. He slumps into unconsciousness.

JONES
(continuing)
Oh man, don't die here...

CUT TO:

EXT./INT. GAS STATION GARAGE - NIGHT 9

The station tow-truck roars to life and backs out into
the rain. Grimbridge is slumped against the passenger
window. Gears grind, wheels spin and the truck
hurtles into the night.

PAN WITH IT, finally revealing a_tall thin figure,
watching from the shadows.

CUT TO:

INT. LINDA'S HOUSE - NIGHT 10

The television plays. commercials..to an empty. room.
Upper middle class; suburban. The front door bursts
open.

JOHN CHALLIS steps in gingerly, rain and lightning
behind him. Square-jawed, late thirties; his hair
and his clothes are all wrong for the suburbs.

CHALLIS
(coming in)
Anybody home?

CONTINUED: 10

A commotion from the other end of the house. TWO
CHILDREN run into the room carrying forks, napkins,
sandwiches, etc. BELLA (9) and WILLIE (10), straight
from the dinner table.

BELLA & WILLIE
(in a jumble)
Daddy's here! Daddy's here! Yay,
Daddy! Whadja bring us?

The children both hit Challis at the same time, nearly
knocking him over.

LINDA
(off-screen)
Children, we leave our food at the
table--

Linda comes in. Pretty, well-coiffed. The perfect
suburban wife. Except that she and Challis aren't
married any more. She looks weary.

Challis takes two paper bags from his coat.

BELLA & WILLIE
Whadja bring us? Lemme see! Lemme
see!

CHALLIS
(to Linda; through the
din)
Hi. Sorry. Bad timing.
LINDA
(phony pleasant)
I'm used to it. Remember?
. .jxCHALLIS
» (to 'the'children)
All right, all right! Here!

He hands each child a paper bag.

ON BELLA AND WILLIE il
In unison, they pull Halloween masks from the bags.
These aren't the kind on TV. These are smaller,

and painted with dull colors.

In unison, the children look disappointed.

BACK TO SCENE 12

CHALLIS
What's wrong? Don't you like them?

WILLIE
Mommy already got us masks...

BELLA
Silver Shamrock! Look!

Challis' face falls. The children drop their gifts
and scamper behind the sofa, emerging seconds later
wearing two beautiful Silver Shamrock masks! Willie
wears a SKULL, his sister a WITCH HEAD. They prance
around the room singing the Silver Shamrock song.

Linda comes over to Challis. The children settle in
front of the TV.

LINDA
(softening)
Nice try.

Challis shrugs, picks up the masks. If it hurts, he
doesn't show it much. The phone RINGS. Both
children lunge for it.

BELLA & WILLIE
I'll get it! I'll get it!

LINDA
(getting there first
Hello? Yes. Just a moment.
(at the kids)
Turn that down!

She holds the phone out to Challis.

ANGLE ON CHILDREN : 413

They return to their perches in front of the TV, still
wearing their masks. Bella turns down the volume just
as the Silver Shamrock commercial comes on! Delighted,
both children bob and dance to the music.

CHALLIS
(into phone)
Yeah?---when? What's his condition?
wc-all right. I'll come on in.
(hanging up)
I've got to go.

LINDA
That's a familiar line.

CHALLIS
"Bye kids--

But the children are absorbed in their TV-dance.
Challis heads for the door. Linda hurries to him.
DOLLY IN CLOSE.

LINDA
(lowering her voice)
John, now listen to me. Saturday
morning, 10:30. You're picking them
up. Right? No excuses this time?

CHALLIS

a, Linda...

LINDA
It's been four weeks, nonstop.
They're your kids too, dammit. I'm
going out of my mind, John, I need
some personal space!! You promised
me-—-

CHALLIS
All right. Saturday.

And he is gone. Linda stares out into the rain.
LINDA

Bastard.

And in the background, the Silver Shamrock jingle
tinkles along...

EXT. SIERRA MADRE - NIGHT

Challis' car slides through the wet night, rounds a
curve and slices through the main street of this small
California town.

INT. CHALLIS' CAR - NIGHT (MOVING)

Challis drives through the night. The rain lets up;
he turns off the wipers. He tries the radio, twisting

the dial:

Jazz, rock, news, the commercial..."eight

more days to Halloween, Halloween, Halloween--"

Disgusted,

Challis snaps the radio off.

EXT. HOSPITAL PARKING LOT - NIGHT

See the hospital from some distance away: A couple of
stories, modern, stark. A few cars scattered in the
gaping parking lot.

Challis' car pulls into a special area near the

building.

He gets out and heads inside. As we PAN

with him, we catch a reflection in a nearby car.

The tall thin man is watching.

INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Challis comes in. He is met by the HEAD NURSE, (AGNES),
a stout woman of middle age.

I. should--

NURSE
His condition is stable, but Doctor
Castle left early, and I just thought

Sure. S'fine.’ Where is he?

The nurse points ahead. They go up the hallway. WE
FOLLOW. -TWO POLICEMEN are standing near a gurney on
which Grimbridge is lying. Jones, the station

attendant,

comes over.

* JONES
Lissen. He just walked up out of
the rain. I swear to God that's all
there was to it...I brought him here...

Challis checks Grimbridge over. He appears to be
asleep.

CHALLIS
Got a room for him?

NURSE
Thirteen.

Challis begins to push the gurney down the hall.

JONES
Hey. Can I leave now?

CHALLIS
Don't see why not.

Challis stops the gurney and extends his hand.
CHALLIS
(continuing; professional
courtesy)
Thanks for helping him out.

Grimbridge hears it. His eyes pop open. He feebly

sound.

BACK TO SCENE 20

Challis hears this and flies to Grimbridge, leaning
in close.

CHALLIS
Can you hear me?

The commercial continues in BACKGROUND. Challis
takes no notice.

GRIMBRIDGE
({haltingly)
They 're----going to----kill us!
All of us!!!
Grimbridge falls back, trembling.

CHALLIS
Nurse! Nurse!

As the nurse comes running, Jones backs fearfully away,
down the hallway and out the door.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. GRIMBRIDGE'S ROOM - NIGHT 21

Grimbridge sleeps peacefully. The nurse finishes
giving him an injection.

NURSE
That ought to hold him 'til morning.

CHALLIS
Great. Who's next?

NURSE
Nobody.. Except. for him it's a
quiet. night." .

CHALLIS
I could use a nap.

Challis and the nurse come out and head down the
corridor away from CAMERA.

NURSE
Pillows are in the cabinet. There's
some milk and cookies in the fridge.

CHALLIS
I think I should have married you,
Agnes...

He pats her on the behind. She jumps.

NURSE .
Watch it, buster. I play for keeps.

They clown their way down the corridor, their voices
receding. Challis goes into a room. The nurse ducks
in at her station.

After a moment, the tall thin man steps around a

corner. He walks quietly across to Grimbridge'’s
room. ‘

INT. GRIMBRIDGE'S ROOM 23
In the near-darkness, the thin man is no more than a

shadow. He glides silently over to the bed.

ON GRIMBRIDGE 24
Sleeping peacefully, lit dimly by a nearby nightlight.
Suddenly a black-gloved hand clamps down across his

mouth!

His .eyesopen dazedly. His hands feebly claw at the
glove;thé sleeve, but his strength is’no-match. for

the thin man's.

The thin man brings his other hand down toward

Grimbridge's face, his thumb and forefinger poised

The thin man brings his hand down and...

GRIMBRIDGE'S FACE (SFX APPLIANCE)

The thumb and forefinger penetrate deep into
Grimbridge's eye sockets! The hand grips hard,

vice-tight.

CUTAWAY - GRIMBRIDGE'S FEET

His feet begin to kick and quiver.

BACK TO SCENE (SFX APPLIANCE)

Suddenly the gloved hand jerks outward with a
Sickening CRUNCH. Grimbridge's face changes shape
obscenely!

Grimbridge stops struggling.

NEW ANGLE

The thin man takes a towel from beside the bed and
wipes his gloves on it.

NURSE
(off-screen)
‘What are you. doing in heré?!

WHIP PAN to the door. The nurse has come in, is
already crossing to the bed. She sees Grimbridge;
her hands fly to her mouth and she screams.

The thin man walks calmly past her and out the door.

Challis springs up out of his nap; he runs into the
hallway. The thin man slips out the exit door at
the far end. Challis runs down the hallway and into
Grimbridge's room.

NURSE
He's dead!
(pointing)
A man--a man just---

Challis runs again. WE FOLLOW. Down the hallway,
through a door, down a flight of steps, through
another door and into the parking lot. Challis
stops and looks around.

HIS POV 33

In the distance, the thin man reaches his car. He
opens the door and gets inside.

BACK TO CHALLIS 34
He starts running for the car. WE FOLLOW, drawing

close.

ON THE THIN MAN 35

The thin man takes a container and begins to pour
liquid on himself, the dashboard, the back seat!

CHALLIS 36

Challis slows to a stop, mystified.

CHALLIS' POV 37

The thin man strikes a match.

SMASH CLOSEUP - MATCH 38

For a split second, match-light illuminates the thin
man's smooth, blank face. Wet with gasoline!

Within seconds, the entire car is an inferno! The gas

tank explodes, sending a ball of flame into the air!

People run from surrounding building toward the flaming
car, and the mystified doctor.

Challis stands at a window, bleary-eyed, still in
shock.

TWO ATTENDANTS lift Grimbridge's covered body onto a
collapsible stretcher.

The® SHERIFF;. the CORONER™and.another police OFFICER -
talk quietly in the corner.

The attendants wheel the stretcher to the door. They
are met there by ELLIE GRIMBRIDGE, a pretty woman in

Gingerly, the Sheriff lifts the sheet. For just an
instant, sheer horror plays across Ellie's face. She
holds it in check.

Challis watches from his place at the window.

ELLIE
(continuing)
Yes...it's my father.

She turns away, breathing deeply. The policeman
hands her a cup of water. The coroner begins to
pack his bag.

ELLIE
(continuing)
Who did it?

SHERIFF
Some crazy man. Killed himself in
the parking lot right after...
Drugs, probably. Miss Grimbridge--

himself?

The Sheriff pats Ellie's shoulder comfortingly. She
straightens herself and walks out.

Everyone waits for a pregnant moment. Then the
Sheriff sighs hugely.

SHERIFF
(continuing) .
All right, boys. Let's clear out.

The stretcher is wheeled out. One by one, the others
follow.

CUT TO:

INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - LATER
Challis heads wearily toward the exit. A sound stops
him. He looks around.
HIS POV
Down a side corridor, Ellie is pressed against a wall,
half concealed, sobbing quietly.
ON CHALLIS
He watches helplessly.
: FADE OUT.

INT. BAR - MORNING

A television set is mounted high up over the bar. A
Saturday morning cartoon is playing.

There are two people in the bar: Challis and CHARLIE

He looks hung over.

He winces at the cartoon.

CHALLIS
Hey Charlie. How about another
station?

Charlie changes channels, pausing at a preview

trailer for the movie "Halloween." An announcer
intones promises of "a very special Horrorthon on
Halloween night---brought to you by Silver Sham-

 

rock!" The familiar tones of the commercial
follow..."THREE MORE DAYS TO HALLOWEEN, HALLOWEEN,
HALLOWEEN."
CHALLIS
(continuing)

Charlie, come on...

CHARLIE
Whatsamatter? Don't you have any
Halloween spirit?

CHALLIS
No.

Charlie finds a football game. He draws himself a
beer and settles in to watch.

The front door opens and Ellie walks in. She is
casually dressed; she looks refreshed and well-

rested.
ELLIE

I thought about calling or sending
flowers or something, but...I figured
you'd rather be left alone.

ELLIE
Thanks. You figured right.
(after a moment)
Can I ask you something?

CHALLIS

Sure.
ELLIE

Do you do this every morning?
CHALLIS

No! This is a special occasion!
ELLIE

What?
CHALLIS

The weekend... .
(glancing at his watch)

It also probably has to do with the

fact that I've got to pick up my

kids in a little while and I'm not

really looking forward to it.
(holding up his drink)

Get you one?

ELLIE
No thanks. Can I ask you something
else?

Challis nods, amused. Ellie is very attractive;
she also knows how to ask questions without being
obnoxious.

ELLIE

Did my father say anything to you
the night he died?

Challis studies his drink for a moment.

anyway.

CHALLIS
Listen. I guess you have a right
to know the truth. What he really
said was, 'they're going to kill us
all.' I hate to tell you this, but
your old man was out of his mind.
They found him wandering in the
rain--

Challis stops. He has gone too far. Ellie fights
back tears.

ELLIE
Could I show you something?
CUT TO:
INT. GRIMBRIDGE'S STORE - DAY 49

The store is dark. Ellie lets herself and Challis
in. The front blinds are drawn; "closed" signs hang
forlornly in the windows.

ELLIE
Papa really loved this place. But
business was getting bad. I sup-
pose you. shopped at the new mall

Challis doesn't answer. He looks around the dusty
store. It is a sort of hardware-variety store; a
bit of everything.

Along one wall is a rack of sports equipment. Next
to that, a row of automobile tires. A shelf of toys.
Tools, bicycles, clothing, arranged willy-nilly.

She picks up an old-looking ledger by the cash

register.

ELLIE

The kids were keeping him going.
They'd come in after school. He
really loved them. Let 'em play
with the stuff right in the aisles...
like I used to do when I was little.

Candy, gum. A bicycle, a basketball,
lots of toys...his best customers.

He kept pretty good records for a
crazy man, Doctor--

CHALLIS
Look, I'm sorry about the comment.
Maybe I should go.

ELLIE
No. I did want to show you something.

She picks up an appointment book.

ELLIE

‘October 18, ° Merchant's council
meeting. October 19; ‘football game.
October. 20, pick up more masks.'
That's the last entry. I think he

make these is not too far away.
Santa Mira.

CHALLIS
So what?

ELLIE
If he went to the factory to pick
up his order--

CHALLIS
Why wouldn't he just have it sent?

ELLIE
Too close to Halloween? Besides,
any merchant will tell you if you
go to the factory direct, you'll
cut your overhead! If Papa went
there, then maybe they know some-

oa thing I need to know.

CHALLIS

Maybe.
ELLIE

My father wasn't crazy! And the
Sheriff can talk all year about a
drug-crazed lunatic running ber-
serk and I still don't buy it.
I'm surprised anybody does.

perched on the phone booth, and hops into the car.
It glides off into the California afternoon.

PAN WITH IT and continue to: ...the show window
of an appliance store. Rows and rows of TV sets.

Jerk!

Challis spins around, watching the truck.

HIS POV - THROUGH THE BACK WINDOW 61a

The truck, featuring a Silver Shamrock logo on its '
side and back, rumbles around the curve and out of

sight.

EXT. CAR 62

The car starts onto the road again. Another truck

rounds the curve and roars out of town, again taking

all the road.

Ellie coughs in the dust.

CHALLIS
Welcome to Santa Mira.

Ellie rolls up her window and pulls onto the road
again.
EXT. “SANTA MIRA OUTSKIRTS - DAY . 63
The car rounds a curve and passes a large sign:
WELCOME TO SANTA MIRA, HOME OF
SILVER SHAMROCK
In the distance, SEE for the first time, the red-

brick factory. Smokestacks. A huge Silver Shamrock
logo at the highest part of the building.

a tiny Motel. On the hill behind this sits the
Silver Shamrock factory.
CLOSER ANGLE - GAS STATION

RAFFERTY, the very Irish-looking attendant, stands
beneath a sign bearing the inscription:

RAFFERTY'S DELUXE
His eyes follow Ellie's car as it turns a distant
corner.
EXT. SANTA MIRA TOWN SQUARE - LATER AFTERNOON
Ellie's car pulls into the town square. It rolls
along a row of stores. Most are closed down. No
one is on the street.
EXT./INT. CAR (MOVING)

Ellie and Challis watch the storefronts slide by.

THEIR POV (MOVING)

A deserted storefront. A uniform shop (factory garb

in the window); a neat and tidy little bank,
"SHAMROCK SAVINGS"; a grocery, "SHAMROCK STORE";
and so on.

Here and there, at windows and in doorways, ruddy

Irish faces appear, take along look, then turn away.

WIDE SHOT - HIGH ANGLE

Ellie's car reaches the end of the row of buildings.
It crosses a railroad track, turns in front of an old
church and swings back around, one block over.

PAN TO FOLLOW, finally revealing a strange object in

foreground: Mounted up high on a rooftop, inconspicu-
ous, is a small video camera. Its servo-unit whirs,

following Ellie's car as it passes.

NEW ANGLE - ON STREET

The car pulls up and pauses. BOOM DOWN CLOSE as our
two look up at something.

THEIR POV - LOW ANGLE

The Silver Shamrock factory looms overhead, bathed in
the golden light of the Autumn afternoon.

BACK TO SCENE

ELLIE
Looks a little spooky.

CHALLIS
What do you expect? They make
Halloween masks.

ELLIE
I'm not ready for this. We need
a plan.

CHALLIS

How about this: We drive down
that road, ..get some more beer
and .go’ to’ ‘the’ beach. “

ELLIE
I'm serious!

CHALLIS

All right, here's one: We go back
to that gas station and see if they
know anything. We could pose as
buyers. Maybe even rent a couple
of rooms at that motel...

(looking around furtively)
Then we'd have someplace to talk
without the whole town watching.

Good point. It's getting late,

Ellie wheels the car down the street toward the gas
station.

After a moment, a garage door in the factory slides
open. A long, silver limousine purrs into the street.
Its windows are tinted; no hint of who might be
inside.

It heads off in the other direction.

CUT TO:

EXT. RAFFERTY'S DELUXE - LATER AFTERNOON TO DUSK 74

Ellie's car pulls into the station. RAFFERTY comes
over from the motel. Now he is all smiles, all charm,
all Irish.

RAFFERTY

Good evenin' to ye! Fill ‘er up?
ELLIE

Please.
RAFFERTY

Aaah...and another grand day it's
been in Santa Mira, where the sun
smiles down and takes care of its
own!

He smiles his way to the pumps.
ELLIE

You've got to be kidding...

Challis gets enthusiastically into the act. He leans
forward and slides his arm onto Ellie's shoulders.

CHALLIS
You can say that again! Selling
like hotcakes, too!

RAFFERTY
(genuinely pleased)
Gocod! Good!

CHALLIS
Say, pardner. D'you know whether
there's a vacancy next door? My
wife and I need a place to stay.

He smiles a "husband" kind of smile at Ellie, who
tries not to crack up.

RAFFERTY

You've come to the right place.

(fishing in his pocket)
I own the motel, too! Well, rent
it, really. Mr. Cochran owns it,
of course. He owns everything
around here. But he doesn't try
to tell me how to run my business,
and I don't try to tell him: how
to run his. You see? It ‘all

The trunk pops open. Rafferty smiles.
ELLIE
My goodness! It certainly isn't

There is one small overnight bag in the trunk.
Rafferty grabs it.

RAFFERTY
Light packers, aren't you?

ELLIE
We've had a lot of practice.

Rafferty starts inside with the bag. He hears a

Again from behind the dark glass, this time tight
on Ellie's face. She watches intently.

EXT. WIDE ANGLE 86

The limousine tails away, past a large Winnebago just
pulling into the motel. The vehicle is done up in
loud colors. Recreational gear is stacked on top;

a boy's bicycle is strapped to the grill.

EXT. MOTEL 87

Challis comes out of the office and along the walkway
next to the rooms.

The Winnebago blasts to a skidding stop just in front
of Challis. The bicycle flops onto the ground at his
feet with a CRASH. From somewhere inside the van
comes a cry of distress:

LI'L ‘BUDDY
(off-screen)
Daddeeeee! !!

Challis sets the bike upright. A PORTLY MAN steps
from the driver's seat. BUDDY KUPFER. Fortyish.

He thrusts out his hand.

Buddy's not a bad sort of guy; just a little
obnoxious. Challis shakes his hand and starts
to pass.

CHALLIS
No problem.

BUDDY
Buddy Kupfer. San Diego. That's
my wife, Betty--

BETTY KUPFER, a perfect match for Buddy, wearing a
bouffant hair-do, climbs out, followed by a
miniature Buddy, LI'L BUDDY (12).

BUDDY

It's like the Mickey Mouse Club featuring overweight
suburbanites.

Yes! Thank you, sir! Have a
pleasant stay.
(turning to Buddy)
Mr. Kupfer, I presume? Your rooms
are waiting.

BUDDY
O.K., now this is a freebee, right?
I mean, we could always stay in the
R.V. if we need to--

Challis reaches his door and lingers there, listening.

RAFFERTY

Well that's great!

CHALLIS

ELLIE
What I mean is, this bathroom is

here--

CHALLIS
Oh! I'll get some air.
{at the door)
Listen, if it would make you more
comfortable, I can sleep in the

ELLIE

No, no, no...

She touches his cheek. Then she plants a tiny kiss
there.

I ‘think we can do better than that...

Challis thinks this, too. The ice is broken. He
watches fondly as she crosses toward the bathroom
unbuttoning her blouse. He goes out.

She finishes her shower and steps out, grabbing a
towel. Freezing with this scant cover, she runs to
the bed, grabs the bedspread and wraps it around
herself, shivering.

EXT. SANTA MIRA = DUSK TO NIGHT 91

The last hint of daylight leaves the sky. Mercury-
vapor lights flicker’ on here and there.

Challis comes out of the Liquor store carrying a
bottle in a paper sack. He heads back the way he
came.

EXT. MOTEL ALLEY - NIGHT 92

Challis heads down the alley in back of the motel.

SUDDENLY a FIGURE looms up out of the darkness

beside him!

Challis jumps back, startled. He drops the bottle,
but it doesn't break.

STARKER
Ho, mister! Didn't mean to scare
you. I just saw that bottle of
your'n and thought it looked
pretty heavy.

Challis picks up the bottle and says nothing.

STARKER
(continuing)
I. ain't got no diseases, and I
wager I keep myself as clean as
you do. How about a drink?

Challis hands over the bottle. Starker leans into
it, taking a good long pull. His face catches the
light.

It is an old face somehow, even though the man
couldn't be more than forty. STARKER wears a brimmed
hat and a ragged sports jacket. He is the local bum.

STARKER

(snorting)
Huh! Do I know anything?

(dripping sarcasm)
Why he made Santa Mira what it is
today...a dried-up little pile of
nothing! Used to be a pretty nice
spot. Good people. Not any more.
He bought 'em all. Every one of
‘em. Except me. I didn't have
anything to sell.

(a pause)
I tried to get a job in his place.
Let me tell you something. He
brought in every damn one of them
factory people from the outside.
You think he'd hire me? Local boy?
No way. Turned me down flat. So I
make my money the hard way. You
don't have a dollar you could spare,
do you?

Challis searches his pocket, finds a dollar. Starker
takes it, borrows the bottle again.

STARKER
(continuing; another slug)
Mmm!. God..damn... Thank you. ~ .

All I can tell you mister, is watch
out. Seen the TV cameras yet? He's

There is a stir at the back of the office. The
typewriters fall silent. A door opens and in walks
CONAL COCHRAN, an incredibly kind looking gentleman
in a blue suit, white shirt and red tie. He is
followed closely by TWO YOUNG IRISHMEN with rather
blank faces, also in suits, these of gray.

The effect is of legitimate, wealthy, corporate
ower. But the gray suits are familiar. Last night.
Starker's killers!

Cochran moves easily through the office and up to

it. * : 7

making the three Silver Shamrock masks: WITCH, SKULL
and JACK-O-LANTERN.

The place is strangely quiet; just the dull presence
of a large room. Its light is constant; day or night.

Our group enters through a door at one end. Little
Buddy .is- first; he runs-~ ahead.

INT. COCHRAN'S PRIVATE QUARTERS (THE DISPLAY ROOM) 114

Very low light. A series of display cases. A wall
full of monster masks. A door marked "PRIVATE".

Little Buddy darts through, ahead of the others. . He
gives everything a quick look, .then moves on ahead,
playing with his computer game.

The others enter and spread out, as if at a museum.
Here, a cluster of wonderful looking mechanical toys.
There, a display case full of gag novelties.

Buddy and Challis find themselves grouped together.

BUDDY
Oh, wow...this is it. This is
really it. Hall of Fame time...

CHALLIS
What's famous?

BUDDY
You really don't know? Conal
Cochran? The all-time genius
of the practical joke? He invented

Look at that paint job. Boy, I'm

chance to see these--

(braying)
LITTLE BUDDY!!! BE SURE AND LOOK
AT THIS STUFF!!! S'EDUCATIONAL...
(to Challis) :

It's a real shame Mr. Cochran
doesn't make this stuff anymore,
but it wasn't paying off. Took
a lot of guts for him to cut his
losses and find something with
some profit in it.

CHALLIS
The masks?

You bet. The Big Halloween Three.
Restrict the choices, lower the
price, go for quality, simplify.

Challis and Buddy come around a corner into a spacious
receiving room. They stop and look. PAN AROUND.

The beaming office workers have gathered here along
with Cochran Marge and the others. A large cake and
a punch bowl sit waiting. Decorations hang from the ceiling.
Cochran holds a large ceremonial plaque out to Buddy.
COCHRAN
Buddy Kupfer, it is my pleasure
to present you with this year's
Silver Shamrock Halloween Sales
Award. Congratulations.

Buddy steps forward, speechless. The office workers
applaud. Betty beams. Li'l Buddy picks his nose.

Ellie backs toward the Display Room.

Ellie comes in. The room is empty. She moves quickly
over to a door marked "PRIVATE". She opens it.

A.Graysuit is standing there. Looking at her.

She closes the door again. Another Darksuit separates
himself from the shadows at the other end of the room.

The office workers are making merry. Buddy is
shaking Cochran's hand.

Betty fishes in her purse and comes up with a camera.
She hands it to a Graysuit, who obligingly snaps a
picture.

COCHRAN
Oh! And one more thing...
{taking an envelope
from his coat)
A. small token of my appreciation.

He hands the envelope to Buddy. There is a game-show
sort of atmosphere prevalent as Buddy opens the envelope
and gasps at what he sees. A check.

BUDDY
Five thousand dollars!

BETTY
Oh my God...

Betty throws her arms around Cochran's neck. More
applause from the office-workers. Marge joins in.
Challis and Ellie stand awkwardly to one side, staring
at the spectacle, trading mystified glances.

Everyone follows.

EXT. FACTORY YARD - DAY 116

There is a maze of activity here: YARDMEN and DRIVERS
scurry about, moving case after case of masks onto
pallettes, onto trucks, onto converyors, onto fork
lifts. Loaded trucks pull out of the yard, bound for
the outside world.

LOADING DOCK 116A

Cochran and the others come out onto the platform.
They are surrounded by activity. A truck is loaded. ‘
It pulls away.

Boxes are stacked everywhere. Cochran nods at one
of the Graysuits, who walks over to a stack of boxes
outside a set of double doors marked NO ADMITTANCE.

There is something about the door, the entranceway,
that seems sinister, forbidding.

The Graysuit picks up one of the boxes here and tears
it open. Cochran, Li'l Buddy and Buddy come over.
The Graysuit hands a Jack-o-lantern mask to Cochran.
Buddy points at the double doors.

BUDDY

In sharp foreground SEE the back of the mask as
Cochran pulls it onto the boy's head.

The seal is clearly visible now, in its place at
the base of the neck-flap.

Cochran surveys Li'l Buddy with delight. The old
man claps his hands like a child. Li'l Buddy runs
around 'scaring' people. Buddy points at the door
again.

BUDDY
(to Cochran)
So can we take'a look?

COCHRAN
I'm sorry. Part of the inspec-
tion process involved highly
volatile chemicals. I'd hate
to put anyone in danger.

BUDDY
Oh sure. I understand.

COCHRAN
I do hope you and your family

ELLIE
How strange. - What--

Something catches Ellie's eye.

A forklift is driving into a dark garage. As the

door is sliding shut, SEE just a glimpse of a green
station wagon...

themselves locking the garage.

One of the Graysuits points apologetically to a

What I don't know is, what does it

there one on each and every Halloween
mask?

of masks on the bed)
I don't get it...

Ellie fights off a wave of dread and fear.

ELLIE
Perhaps my--husband might know
more about this. I'll get him.

MARGE
Great. And see if you can round
up some batteries. These are too
weak.

She holds up her transister radio. She has pulled
the batteries out of it and stacked them on the desk.

Linda Challis is fast asleep. The phone RINGS on the
table beside her. She starts confusedly in the
double-bed she now occupies alone.

LINDA
(into phone)
Yes...? Who the...John!
{sitting up)
What do you want? Is this some
kind of--?

She listens with increasing amazement.

LINDA
(continuing)
You're drunk! I know you, John!
You've been drinking all night
and you...

She listens again. Frowning. Shaking her head.

LINDA
(continuing)
The Halloween masks? The ones I
bought? You want me to--what?

Linda explodes.

LINDA

(continuing)
Mommie gives them the masks, and
Daddy tries tb take them away.
It's just the same old crap!
You're jealous because you know
the children love me more than
they love you-- You just go to
hell! .

She SLAMS the phone down. Then, so as not to be
disturbed again, she takes it off the hook.

She looks up. Willie, wearing his SKULL mask as
well as his pajamas, has come into the doorway.

WILLIE
Who was that?

Nobody, sweetheart...

Challis frantically dials again. A busy signal.

He hangs up, reaches in his pocket for more change,
plunks it in and dials another number.

Car headlights flash across the phone booth.

Challis turns.

POV FROM PHONE BOOTH

Two factory cars move ominously up the road.

ON CHALLIS

Challis quickly ducks out of the phone booth and
runs into the darkness of the houses along the road.

The factory cars SCREECH to a stop at the phone booth.

Factory men get out. Stare up the street.

POV - ROAD

Challis is gone into the night.

EXT. FACTORY - NIGHT

The factory looms in the b.g.

IN CLOSE F.G. is another remote TV camera. It pans
slowly around, searching the night with its blank,
infra-red eye.

WE “BOOM ‘DOWN'"TO REVEAL CHALLIS hiding directly
underneath the TV camera, out of sight of the lens.

As the TV camera pans away from him, Challis runs
quickly into the shadows of the factory wall. The
infra-red eye has not seen him.

CLOSE ON FACTORY WALL

Challis' face emerges from the shadows for a moment.
In the b.g. more factory cars race around the streets.

THE DISPLAY ROOM

REV. 4/4/82

Now Challis turns to the door marked "PRIVATE" --
the one tried by Ellie earlier. He opens it a crack.

INT. COCHRAN'S QUARTERS (WORKSHOP/OFFICE)

Cochran looks around. The room is a spacious office,
with a huge desk and chair. Beyond this is a large
workbench, with tools and equipment of all kinds. We
are looking at the workbench of an inventor. Toys,

model trains, mechanical parts, masks, musical instru-

ments lie about.

Dark and spooky; eccentric.

Challis moves through the place carefully, toward a
pool of light around the corner TO SEE:

Another desk. An antique desk lamp. Seated at the
desk is an OLD WOMAN. Huddled over a game of
solitaire. Her gloved hands flip the cards method-

ically.

ANGLE ON CHALLIS AND OLD WOMAN

Challis moves up behind the cold woman.

CHALLIS

Where's the girl?

The old woman ignores him. Flips the cards.

CHALLIS
(continuing)

Where is she?

In a burst of anger Challis g;: abs at her to pull

her:around, ‘make ‘her listen.’

 

And her arm comes off in his hand!

CLOSE ON OLD WOMAN'S SHOULDER

The silk of her blouse tears. The whole shoulder

joint is exposed.
TICKS inside!

A clockwork joint CLICKS and

ON CHALLIS AND OLD WOMAN 187
Challis stares in horror at-the arm he is holding.

The fingers are still moving, still trying to flip

cards that aren't there!

Now the whole body of the old woman tips sideways.

It sways toward him. He grabs it. The other hand

is still holding the deck of cards.

She slips from her chair. Challis struggles to get

her back into it. Now her head droops at an angle

no head should be at. Then the old woman slides
to the floor.

Her head comes right off!

And now, with a CLICK, the mechanism ceases to
function. The old woman is completely still.

Challis stares in amazement.

WHAM! TWO HANDS grab him from behind and whirl him
around!

The cold, emotionless face of the factory assassin
stares into his!

Challis SLAMS a fist into the assassin's midsection.

Absolutely no reaction. As if the assassin hasn't
felt it.

Then suddenly Challis is hurled across the room. He
SMASHES into a bookshelf and flops to the floor.

The factory assassin moves for him.

Challis springs from the floor and tackles the assassin.
They go careening around the room,. CRASHING into: every-

. thing; then finally sprawling tothe floor. :

WHACK! The assassin's hand SNAPS on Challis' face!
Fingers spread! Pressing into Challis' eyes!

Challis grabs the hand viced on his face. But can't
pull it off! The fingers close tighter!

Challis raises his hand and plunges it downward!

Into the assassin's stomach!

And Challis' hand actually goes in! Through the

shirt into the flesh!

Milky silicone sprays out of the stomach! Challis
rips his hand out. In his fist is a mass of micro-

electronics, wires, chips, all covered with the

milky silicone!

FULL SHOT 189

Challis pulls himself out of the assassin's grip.
He rolls away across the floor.

The assassin remains motionless. Silicone pouring
out of his mouth. His arm still in the air. The
fingers still pressing inward.

CLOSE ON CHALLIS oS 190
Out of breath. Stares.

For a beat.

Then suddenly HANDS GRAB HIM!

FACTORY GUARDS pour into the office, pile on top of
him, hold him down!

FULL SHOT 191

Cochran steps into the office. He looks like a host
hurt by the unforgivable behavior of a guest. He
glances at the immobile assassin, then picks up the
old woman's head.

COCHRAN
Clumsy. This was a rare piece.
German. Made in Munich, 1685.
I must try to get a replacement.
My European agent...perhaps...
(it is real regret,
something short of
grief. Now he comes
to himself again)
Mister Challis...It's been such
a long night for all of us.

a cigar. He strokes the lid of the box.

Bog oak. From the bogs of
Ireland. Do you smoke?

CHALLIS
(ignoring this)
Where's Ellie?

COCHRAN
Mrs.--'Smith'? Why, I believe
she's resting just. now.

Challis moves as if to get up. A Graysuit hand slams
him back into place.

COCHRAN

{continuing; looking

at his watch)
It didn't take you very long
to get here, Mister Challis.
It will be morning soon.
Halloween morning. It's going
to.be a busy day for me. And
for you too. You'll recall I
promised to show you everything.
I always keep my promises sir,
indeed I do...

Cochran smiles his warm, fatherly smile.

EXT. FACTORY YARD - DAWN 192

The sun is coming up. The factory yard looks blue
and cold in the morning glow.

All work has stopped in the yard. It looks deserted.

Old and rickety, like the exterior of the factory.
Cochran leads his troupe inside. WE FOLLOW, through
a dark hallway and across an anteroom.

Along the walls, standing stiffly, are the Yardmen.
Frozen. Immobile. Robots.

COCHRAN
T'would be nice to work them
around the clock. But the night
air is bad for them...

Cochran reaches the top of a long flight of stairs.

COCHRAN

Machines, Mister Challis. Every
one. Except for you and me, of
course.

Challis glances at the two Graysuits holding his
arms. No reaction from them. Blank. Emotionless.

COCHRAN

But you figured that out last

night, didn't you?
He moves down the steps. The Graysuits lead Challis
along. behind ‘him. .

COCHRAN
Convincing, aren't. they? Loyal
and obedient.

One of the Darksuits holds out a pile of white garments
to Cochran. He seats himself and puts them on over
his shoes and hands.

The other Darksuit wrenches a similar set onto
Challis' hands and feet. They are the sort of thing
found in dust-free laboratories, or germ-free clinics.

COCHRAN

(continuing)
The surprising thing is that the
internal components are quite simple
to produce, really. The external
features took a lot longer to perfect, but
in the end, it's just another form
of maskmaking,

The elevator lurches to a halt. The lighting goes
red. A blower from somewhere sends air wafting through.

CHALLIS
Ellie's father. You sent one of
these out to kill him.

Cochran smiles resignedly.

CHALLIS
(continuing)
Then it destroyed itself. No

For a moment all is dark. Then someone moves. SEE
lights down below. Cochran, dimly outlined, moves
to a railing. WE FOLLOW.

COCHRAN

Do you know anything about

Halloween, Mister Challis?
A remarkable scene reveals itself.
Spread beneath us is a huge room, mostly in darkness.
Directly below, surrounded by high-intensity lights,
is a long rectangular stone, partially covered with
protective material.
Technicians are gathered around it.

At the other end of the room is a tightly-gathered

array of monitor screens and: consoles. (THE HIGH
TECH AREA). Several more Technicians are busy here.
COCHRAN
(continuing; almost in
a whisper)

It was the start of the year in
our old Celtic lands. We would
wait in our houses made of turf.
The barriers were down, you see,
between the real and the unreal.

Cochran moves along the catwalk. The others follow.

COCHRAN

They never dreamed of this.
The harnessing and storing of
