    ï¿½ 2002 Kevin Kangas

 
 
              INT. BEDROOM - DAY
 
              LYNN, asleep, squirms on the bed. She's early thirties, very
              pretty, thin-bodied. She MUMBLES in discomfort.
 
              IN HER DREAM
 
              is A YOUNG GIRL in the back seat of a station wagon. She
              plays with a Barbie, shows it toward CAMERA at the people O.S.
 
              Someone SHOUTS, high-pitched but distorted in a dream-like
              fashion.
 
                                  WOMAN
                        Henry, watch out--!
 
              The young girl's eyes move up from her Barbie toward the
              front of the car--slow, too slow.
 
              EVERYTHING SPEEDS UP, the frame shaking like an epileptic
              suddenly got hold of the camera.
 
              Only a half-second has passed, but the young girl is now
              lying sideways on the back seat and her forehead is smeared
              with blood.
 
              She sits up slowly, dazed. Whatever she sees in the front
              seat disturbs her. Her lip begins to shake, tears welling in
              her eyes.
 
              Something pops into her peripheral vision. She turns.
 
              A CLOWN has appeared in the window next to her. He SHOUTS
              something unintelligible to her, and then RIPS HIS CLOWN FACE
              OFF to reveal a bloody skull--
 
              The little girl SCREAMS--
 
              --and Lynn bolts upright on her bed, screaming. She stops
              immediately as she realizes where she is, but it takes her a
              moment to calm down.
 
              She turns to the clock--it's 5:38.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Shit.
 
              She jumps up and heads for the shower.
 
              INT. RESTAURANT - EVENING
 
              Small neighborhood diner. Wooden chairs and small tables.
              Lynn rushes in and spots JULIE sitting alone. She rushes over
              to join her friend.

                                  LYNN
                        I am so sorry--
 
                                  JULIE
                               (friendly ribbing)
                        Sure, whatever it is is so
                        important that you don't want to
                        tell me on the phone, but it's not
                        so important you can't be--
                               (checks watch)
                        --a half hour late.
 
                                  LYNN
                        I fell asleep--
 
                                  JULIE
                               (pointing at an empty
                                plate)
                        Look! I finished all the chicken
                        fingers. I'm going to have to go
                        to the bathroom and make myself
                        throw up.
 
              Lynn smirks at her friend and sits down.
 
                                  LYNN
                        I need a drink.
 
              She motions for the waitress and orders a glass of red wine.
 
                                  JULIE
                        So spill.
 
                                  LYNN
                               (swallows, takes a
                                breath)
                        I'm getting a divorce, Julie.
 
                                  JULIE
                        Shut up.
 
              She sees that Lynn's not kidding and her smiles lowers like
              a draw-bridge.
 
                                  JULIE
                        What? Since when?
 
                                  LYNN
                        Things have been bad for...about
                        a year now. I guess things have
                        never been that great.

                                  JULIE
                        Well...I just...why didn't you
                        tell me?
 
                                  LYNN
                        You know...you're--
 
                                  JULIE
                        Don't even. I'm your friend first.
                        Manager second.
 
                                  LYNN
                        I thought we could work it out.
                        Bert kept making promises and I
                        kept waiting for him to keep them.
                        Guess what I just found out.
                               (doesn't give her a
                                chance)
                        His ex-wife's name is still on the
                        deed to the house. The house I'm
                        living in. He said as soon as I
                        sold my house and moved in, he'd
                        have it taken off. And you know
                        how I found out her name's still
                        on it?
 
              Julie shakes her head.
 
                                  LYNN
                        The internet. I had to find out on
                        the goddamn internet.
 
              She realizes her voice has started to rise in volume, so she
              takes a sip of her recently-delivered wine, and calms herself.
 
                                  LYNN
                        I don't know if that was the final
                        straw. It was everything. Julie,
                        I don't know anything about him.
                        I don't know how much money he
                        makes because he didn't want us to
                        have a joint checking account. He
                        always says he's working late at
                        night but he won't give me a
                        number to call other than his cel
                        phone. And that place...it gives
                        me the creeps.
 
                                  JULIE
                        It's a sanitarium. They do that.

                                  LYNN
                               (shrugs, moot point)
                        I told him I was leaving and that
                        I was taking Nicky. He hit me.
 
              Julie is shocked.
 
                                  JULIE
                        He...hit you?
 
                                  LYNN
                               (nods)
                        I was packing some things. I said
                        I was taking Nicky and I'd be
                        filing for a divorce. He hit me in
                        the back of the head.
 
                                  JULIE
                        Did you call the police?
 
                                  LYNN
                        No. I just wanted to get out of
                        there. That was a month ago.
 
                                  JULIE
                        You separated a month ago and
                        didn't tell me?
 
                                  LYNN
                        I didn't want to bother you, what
                        with all the stuff you've already
                        got on your plate...
 
              She stops as she sees the look on Julie's face; How
              Ridiculous.
 
                                  JULIE
                        So what are you going to do?
 
                                  LYNN
                        Get the divorce. Once I get full
                        custody of Nicky, I'll start
                        trying to reassemble what's left
                        of my life. In California.
 
                                  JULIE
                        You're going to move?
 
                                  LYNN
                        I told Phillip yesterday. I didn't
                        tell him why.
 
                                  JULIE
                        How'd he take it?

                                  LYNN
                        He was shocked, you know, at
                        first. But he was very supportive
                        as always.
 
              Julie pulls out her cel phone and starts dialing.
 
                                  JULIE
                        Okay, the first thing I'm going to
                        do is cancel the exhibit tomorrow
                        night--
 
                                  LYNN
                        Nononononono, please Julie.
 
              Julie reluctantly hangs up.
 
                                  LYNN
                        You've worked so hard, and to tell
                        you the truth, it'll be good to
                        meet some new people. Take my mind
                        off.
 
                                  JULIE
                        Lynn. We'll just postpone it. I
                        don't think it's a good idea for
                        you to be doing an exhibit when
                        you've got this much on your mind.
 
                                  LYNN
                        It'll be good. No, great.
 
                                  JULIE
                        You sure? Really sure?
 
                                  LYNN
                        Really.
 
                                  JULIE
                        Where are you staying?
 
                                  LYNN
                        A friend of mine is out of the
                        country for a couple months. She
                        said I could stay at her house
                        until I find someplace of my own.
 
                                  JULIE
                        What about Nicholas?
 
                                  LYNN
                        Every other day. The lawyers had
                        a temporary agreement drawn up.

                                  JULIE
                        In this state, you'll have no
                        trouble getting sole custody.
 
                                  LYNN
                               (nods)
                        I'm not worried about that. It's
                        just...this can't be my life,
                        Julie. I can't be a divorced
                        mother. I just, I can't.
 
                                  JULIE
                        People change, Lynn.
 
                                  LYNN
                               (wistful)
                        I don't think I ever really knew
                        him in the first place...
 
              INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
 
              The moon casts a faint light through the window. Lynn is
              asleep in her bed, this time without the nightmares.
 
              OUR VIEW
 
              looks down upon her, and for a moment there's the impression
              that someone is in the bedroom standing over her. But then we
 
              MOVE slowly across the bed toward the window, passing the
              nightlight plugged into the wall panel, right up to the
              window and
 
              THROUGH IT
 
              into the dark night. We get a nice bird's eye view of the
              street.
 
              Pools of black shadow lie everywhere. The houses along the
              street are all dark grey shapes set against a starless sky.
              Each house appears very middle-class suburban.
 
              All is quiet. Still.
 
              Across the street from Lynn's, SOMETHING MOVES FROM UNDER THE
              SHADOW OF A TREE.
 
              Still hidden in the darkness under the leaves, it's
              impossible to tell what it is. Then THE CLOWN moves into the
              light and we can see he's got some sort of bag in his hand.
              The streetlight above catches him in total silhouette, so
              it's impossible to tell much about him.

              And yet, there's something definitely sinister about him. Is
              it the peculiar sight of a clown standing in a deserted
              street in the dead of night? Or something else...?
 
              The clown scans the houses across the street and his gaze
              stops at the house two doors up from Lynn.
 
              He turns to look directly at Lynn's house, and makes a
              shrugging motion, very much like, "What can I do? My hands
              are tied."
 
              He moves across the street, taking a new grip on whatever's
              in the bag, and the bag falls into the street.
 
              He holds a giant axe. Even in the dim light, the silver axe-
              blade gleams like mercury.
 
              Silently, the house awaits his entrance. Taking his time, he
              moves toward the door.
 
              EXT. HOUSE - DAY
 
              Lynn rushes out of her house, clearly late for something. She
              stops in confusion as she sees five cop cars and an ambulance
              in front of the house two doors down.
 
              A good bunch of the neighbors--moms and kids--stand about in
              groups, pointing and asking questions. Lynn goes over to a
              neighbor, GALE, a chubby motherly type who's shaking her head
              without realizing it.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Excuse me...I'm house-sitting for
                        Margaret. Could you tell me what's
                        going on?
 
                                  GALE
                               (tsks)
                        Oh it's just awful. If we're not
                        safe here, where on earth can we
                        possibly move to?
 
              She tsks again, but otherwise isn't forthcoming.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Do you know what happened?
 
                                  GALE
                        The Olsons. All of them. Killed
                        while they slept.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Killed?

                                  GALE
                        Butchered, from what I hear.
                               (off Lynn's look)
                        I know. How could something like
                        that happen here? While we slept?
                        This is a nice neighborhood.
 
                                  LYNN
                        My god...
 
              She breaks it off and shakes her head.
 
              DETECTIVE PETERS, a young guy who looks more like a rock star
              incognito, wanders over with a pad of paper.
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        Morning folks. You all know the
                        Olsons?
 
                                  GALE
                        Of course. Who are you?
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        Sorry.
                               (flashes the badge)
                        Detective Peters. Homicide, of
                        course. Either of you happen to
                        hear or see anything unusual last
                        night?
 
                                  GALE
                        Why yes.
                               (Peters is interested)
                        There was a carfull of raving
                        psychopaths parked in front of the
                        house about midnight, but I
                        figured if we left them alone,
                        they'd go away.
 
              Detective Peters is put off by the sarcasm coming from
              someone who appears so motherly. He looks to Lynn, who smiles
              uncomfortably.
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        Maam. I need to know if you saw
                        anything out of the ordinary last
                        night, or heard anything.
 
                                  GALE
                        Don't you think I'd have called
                        the police in that case?

                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        Maybe. Maybe not. It might not
                        have struck you as strange at the
                        time, but maybe now, with what's
                        happened...
 
                                  LYNN
                        What exactly happened?
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                               (not particularly
                                sympathetic)
                        Your neighbors have been murdered.
                        I can't tell you any more than
                        that right now.
 
              He hands them both a card.
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        If something comes to you, give me
                        a ring huh?
 
                                  GALE
                        That's all? That's all the
                        questions you're going to ask?
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        Oh hey. Sorry. Did either of you
                        happen to kill the Olsons?
 
              Gale is not amused. Lynn's watching them carry a bodybag on
              a stretcher out of the Olsons' house. Something about the
              sight has trapped her gaze.
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                               (didn't really need
                                an answer anyway)
                        Okay. Thanks. One of my guys will
                        be over to take your names.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Detective? I'm sorry, I'm already
                        late.
                               (she digs in her
                                purse and pulls out
                                a card)
                        This has my name and cel phone
                        number on it. I'm...house sitting
                        here for the next couple of weeks.
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                               (looking at the card)
                        An artist, huh? You don't much
                        look like an artist.

                                  GALE
                        Says the rock-star detective.
 
              Peters spares her a glance, but ignores her. The way Lynn
              stumbled over the half-lie seems to have caught the
              detective's attention.
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        How long you been...house sitting?
 
                                  LYNN
                        About four, no, five nights.
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                               (nods his head)
                        I may have to come by later and
                        ask you a few questions, Miss...
                               (checks the card
                                again)
                        Blodgett.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Sure, I understand.
                               (beat)
                        Oh, no! I'm sorry, I've got an
                        exhibit tonight, so I won't be
                        back at all today. Tomorrow should
                        be fine though.
 
                                  GALE
                        Why don't you leave her alone? Do
                        you think she did it? Is that what
                        your keen detective mind is
                        telling you?
 
              The detective turns a bemused smile on Gale.
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        Wow. You're Miss Cleaver on the
                        outside, but the inside's a real
                        bitch, ain't it?
 
                                  GALE
                        Ex-cuse me?
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        I guess I'm not so good with the
                        sarcastic reh-par-tee.
 
              He stumbles over the word like it's too hard to wrap his
              tongue around, but there's a quiet intelligence in his eyes.
              An intelligence that just filed Gale under "B" for bitch.
 
              He wanders off shaking his head.

                                  GALE
                        His superior's going to hear about
                        this.
 
                                  LYNN
                               (rushing off)
                        Well, it was nice meeting you, I'm
                        really really late now.
 
                                  GALE
                               (calls after her)
                        I'm Gale. Gale Wroten.
 
              Lynn waves back without looking and hightails it to the car.
 
              INT. GALLERY - DAY
 
              The gallery looks new. Shiny hardwood floors. Small rooms
              showcase paintings on the wall, with new wave furniture
              awaiting the pretentious ass of some wannabe art critic.
 
              Lynn rushes in. AMANDA, 23, steps out with a clipboard. She's
              cute in a mousy, Lisa Loeb kind of way.
 
                                  AMANDA
                        Lynn, hey.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Sorry I'm late. You'll never
                        believe the morning I'm having.
 
                                  AMANDA
                        No worries. Everything's going
                        pretty hokay. OOPS still hasn't
                        delivered two of the pieces, but
                        everything else is here.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Phil around?
 
                                  AMANDA
                        Yup.
 
              As if he heard, PHILLIP REID rounds the corner. He's kind-
              faced, late thirties, dressed in an old-fashioned brown
              suit-and-vest. He's got the makings of a slight gut.
 
                                  PHILLIP
                        Lynn, some of these new pieces are
                        amazing! You've been doing great
                        work lately. Fabulous stuff.

                                  LYNN
                        Thanks, Phil. And thank you so
                        much for this.
 
                                  PHILLIP
                        It's my pleasure.
                               (takes on an
                                aristocratic air)
                        You know how prestigious it is to
                        once again be showcasing the great
                        Lynn Blodgett at my gallery.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Oh, please.
 
                                  PHILLIP
                        If Picasso were still alive, I'd
                        turn him down to get you.
 
                                  AMANDA
                        Ass kisser.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Well, thanks. It means a lot to me.
 
                                  PHILLIP
                        What do you think? Should we
                        expect a crowd tonight?
 
                                  AMANDA
                        I think you'll be pleasantly
                        surprised...
 
              On Lynn's questioning look...
 
              INT. GALLERY - NIGHT
 
              Same place, plus a hundred people. No one speaks loud. It's
              all QUIET MURMURS over wine or mixed drinks.
 
              Lynn's standing against a back wall with Amanda. She looks
              dazed.
 
                                  LYNN
                               (quiet)
                        How...on earth...did you get all
                        these people here?
 
                                  AMANDA
                        WWW dot I hate clowns dot com. I
                        posted it on their message
                        board.

                                  LYNN
                        But...if they hate clowns, why
                        would they come?
 
                                  AMANDA
                        It's a love-hate thing.
 
              Lynn shakes her head; she doesn't understand, but who's
              complaining?
 
              She touches Amanda's arm to signal that she's moving. She
              begins to weave aimlessly among the people, pausing just long
              enough to catch whether they like her stuff or not. Most seem
              to.
 
              INTO ANOTHER ROOM
 
              not as crowded as the main room. A COUPLE murmurs about the
              painting in front of them, while across the room is TUCK, 28.
              He's dark-skinned Latino, dressed like a model. He's staring
              deeply at one of Lynn's clown paintings.
 
              She sidles up, trying to be sly.
 
                                  LYNN
                        So what do you think?
 
                                  TUCK
                               (spares her a quick
                                look, then back to
                                the painting)
                        I'm not an art critic or
                        anything...
 
                                  LYNN
                        Who is?
 
                                  TUCK
                               (nods, then back to
                                the painting)
                        It's okay. I don't know what the
                        clown fetish is all about--I think
                        the artist has issues.
 
              Lynn smiles. Not what she expected to hear.
 
                                  LYNN
                               (good-natured)
                        Oh?
 
                                  TUCK
                        Well...they're clowns, for
                        chrissakes.

                        But hers are all so...scary.  Did
                        you see the one where you walk in?
                        I think I remember that one from
                        Stephen King's It.
 
              Lynn smiles. She's looking forward to embarrassing him when
              she introduces herself.
 
                                  LYNN
                        But you're no art critic.
 
                                  TUCK
                        No. Tucker Flynn. My friends call
                        me Tuck.
 
              He extends his hand.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Lynn--
 
                                  TUCK
                        --Blodgett, I know.
                               (mischievous smile)
                        I saw your picture in the program.
 
              She smiles and reappraises him.
 
                                  TUCK
                        I didn't want to blow your cover.
                        Not right away anyway.
 
                                  LYNN
                        So what do you really think?
 
                                  TUCK
                        They're good. I mean...they're
                        great.
                               (the smile returns)
                        You've still got issues, but...I
                        think they're phenomenal.
 
              She can tell he's sincere about his appreciation. She's
              touched.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Thanks. You from the web site?
 
                                  TUCK
                        Web site?
 
                                  LYNN
                        Oh, nothing. What made you stop by
                        tonight?

                                  TUCK
                        This is the best gallery in
                        Baltimore. I've bought a couple of
                        pieces here.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Anything of mine?
 
                                  TUCK
                        No. Honestly, I never noticed your
                        stuff before, but I'll definitely
                        be keeping my eye out now.
 
              There are serious looks going on between them, a quick
              chemistry that seems to be catching Lynn off guard.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Well...I hope you have a good time.
 
              She starts to move off.
 
                                  TUCK
                        Hey. You wanna--
                               (shrugs)
                        --maybe go out and get a drink
                        later?
 
                                  LYNN
                        Uh---
 
              Is she searching for an excuse or thinking about accepting?
              She's married, she can't be going out on dates.
 
                                  LYNN
                        It's just a bad time.
 
              He smiles his understanding.
 
                                  TUCK
                        Sure. No problem.
 
              She turns to move off.
 
                                  TUCK
                        How 'bout tomorrow?
 
              She stops.
 
                                  LYNN
                        It's complicated.
 
                                  TUCK
                        Oh.

                                  LYNN
                        I'm married.
 
                                  TUCK
                               (sudden
                                understanding)
                        Ooooh...
 
                                  LYNN
                        I mean, I'm separated.
 
                                  TUCK
                               (no problem then)
                        Oh. Great. I mean, not great like
                        I'm happy about it---
                               (realizes he's
                                screwing up)
                        Hi. I'm Tuck. I'll be right back.
 
              He heads over to the nearest tuxedo's waiter and grabs a
              champagne glass. He holds it up to toast Lynn, then DOWNS it
              in one swallows.
 
              Then he grabs two others off the tray and returns to
              Lynn.
 
                                  TUCK
                        I thought if it didn't cost too
                        much, I could get a guided tour of
                        your work.
 
              Lynn smiles at his persistance. There's something immaturely
              endearing about him. His smile is contagious.
 
              She takes the drink.
 
                                  LYNN
                        I could probably put it on your
                        tab.
 
              Tuck's glad she's going along for the ride. He steps up to
              the painting in front of them.
 
                                  TUCK
                        Take this one. I notice that this
                        clown seems to be in a lot of your
                        paintings. What's the significance?
 
              The more astute viewers will recognize the clown as the one
              from the dream in the beginning. In the painting, he's
              staring out at us with a look of sinister intent. He's in a
              stark white hallway with strange objects on the wall.

              She stares at it intently, as if she's never seen it before,
              as if she's falling into it.
 
              An excited Amanda pops up behind her, saving her from
              answering.
 
                                  AMANDA
                        Boss. The mayor is here.
 
                                  LYNN
                        The mayor? Of the city?
 
                                  AMANDA
                        No, of Sesame Street.
                               (notices Tuck)
                        Who's the hunk?
 
              Lynn's still shocked about the mayor thing, but not so much
              that she can't be embarrassed too.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Sorry. Tuck, this is my number one
                        cheerleader, Amanda. She created
                        my web site and does all my other
                        promotion for me.
 
              Tuck smiles at her ga-ga expression.
 
                                  TUCK
                        Nice to meet you.
 
                                  AMANDA
                        Um hmmm. I'd like to shake my bon
                        bons all over your--
 
                                  LYNN
                        Amanda. Go tell Phillip I'll be
                        right over.
 
                                  AMANDA
                        Okay.
 
              She gives Tuck one last lascivious look, and then she's off.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Sorry about that.
 
                                  TUCK
                        It's flattering.
 
                                  LYNN
                        I guess I should go say hi to the
                        mayor.

                                  TUCK
                        Is he really here, or is that just
                        a ploy you two use to impress
                        people?
 
                                  LYNN
                        I think he's really here.
 
                                  TUCK
                        Impressive. Can I get your
                        autograph later?
 
                                  LYNN
                        Sure. Hang around. I'll be back.
 
              She gives him a fleeting smile and walks away. As soon as her
              back is turned to him, she makes a face. What the hell is she
              doing?
 
              And then her expression turns to dismayed shock.
 
              BERT, her soon-to-be ex-husband, rounds the corner, a wine
              glass in hand.
 
                                  BERT
                        Lynn! There you are.
 
                                  LYNN
                               (quiet)
                        What the hell are you doing here?
 
                                  BERT
                        What? What's the matter?
 
                                  LYNN
                        Who's watching Nicky?
 
                                  BERT
                        He's in great hands, don't worry.
 
                                  LYNN
                        So why are you here, Bert?
 
                                  BERT
                        I came to see your new exhibit, of
                        course.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Bert. What the hell is wrong with
                        you? We're not friends.
                               (as if he's forgotten)
                        You filed for divorce.

                                  BERT
                        Only because you were going to.
 
                                  LYNN
                        We're not doing this here. Please
                        leave.
 
                                  BERT
                        Don't get all apoplectic on me. I
                        didn't realize you'd get so upset.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Why wouldn't I? This is an
                        important night for me.
 
                                  BERT
                        All right. I'll go.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Thanks.
 
              He takes a final sip of his drink before putting it down.
 
                                  BERT
                        I'll call you later.
 
              He's gone before he can see the look of disgust that crosses
              Lynn's face.
 
              She takes a calming breath before she goes looking for the
              mayor.
 
              INT. GALLERY - LATER
 
              The crowd is mostly gone. Lynn's walking through room after
              room. She's looking for Tuck, but trying not to act like it.
 
              Room after room(and blank spaces reveal that the gallery was
              successful in moving some of her paintings) and no Tuck.
              She's starting to get discouraged.
 
              She comes back around to the front counter and there he is
              talking with Phil. Lynn suppresses a smile.
 
                                  PHILLIP
                        Here she comes!
 
                                  TUCK
                        Can I get that autograph now?
 
              He lifts something from the counter that was hidden behind
              his body. It's one of Lynn's paintings.

                                  LYNN
                        But...that's...
 
                                  PHILLIP
                        Your new admirer just purchased
                        your most expensive piece, my dear.
 
                                  LYNN
                        That's eight thousand dollars...
 
                                  TUCK
                        And worth every penny. When it's
                        worth two-hundred grand, you'll
                        beg to buy it back.
                               (to Phillip)
                        Go ahead and wrap it up. I'll get
                        her to autograph it once it's
                        hanging up in my house.
 
              Phillip doesn't get it for a moment. Then he sees the blush
              on Lynn's cheek. He gets it.
 
                                  PHILLIP
                        Oh. Oh...of course.
 
              He begins wrapping as Lynn and Tuck exchange looks.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Do you mind me asking what you do,
                        Tuck?
 
                                  TUCK
                        Wanna see?
 
                                  LYNN
                               (playful flirting)
                        I think that would depend on what
                        it is you do.
 
                                  PHILLIP
                        I'm just, uh, I've got to get some
                        tape from the other room.
 
              Clearly uncomfortable with their flirting, he goes into
              another room.
 
                                  TUCK
                        Seriously. You want to see what I
                        do, my office isn't very far away.

                                  LYNN
                        Okay. But only because you just
                        paid my rent for three
                        months.
                               (louder toward the
                                other room)
                        Phillip, I'll be back soon. I'm
                        going to see Mr. Flynn's office.
 
              EXT. GALLERY
 
              Tuck escorts Lynn outside and opens the passenger door of his
              Porsche. He shuts the door after she pulls her legs in.
 
              ACROSS THE STREET
 
              in the shadows of an alley stands a man. He watches as Tuck
              gets in the Porsche, starts it and drives away.
 
              As it exits the scene, the man steps forward to watch its
              progress. We see it's Bert, a menacing scowl on his face.
 
              INT. TUCK'S OFFICE - LATER
 
              Tuck lets Lynn into the office. She takes a look around as he
              goes to the alarm and turns it off. The office is very nice.
              Clean, well-organized, tastefully decorated.
 
                                  TUCK
                        This is my office.
 
              It's big. She walks down the hall, Tuck following behind her,
              indulging her whim to lead.
 
                                  LYNN
                        So...what do you do?
 
                                  TUCK
                        Look at the pictures.
 
              She's been walking by the pictures on the wall, but now she
              stops to take a better look. The pictures seem to be of
              elaborate roller coasters at various theme parks.
 
                                  LYNN
                        I still don't get it.
 
                                  TUCK
                        My company designs roller
                        coasters. Disney, King's Dominion,
                        Busch Gardens, you name it. I've
                        got a coaster there.
 
              Lynn's impressed.

                                  LYNN
                        How old are you?
 
                                  TUCK
                        Old enough to pick touch football
                        over tackle.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Why don't you want to tell me?
 
                                  TUCK
                        How old are you?
 
                                  LYNN
                               (smiles)
                        Touche.
 
              She's peering close to one picture. It shows some crazy
              sumbitch standing on the highest point of a tall roller
              coaster, no car.
 
                                  TUCK
                        That's me.
 
                                  LYNN
                        No.
 
              She looks closer. It's a far off shot, but it sure looks like
              it could be him.
 
                                  TUCK
                        Every time they finish a new
                        coaster of mine, I like to stand
                        at the highest point.
 
                                  LYNN
                        You're out of your mind.
 
                                  TUCK
                               (shrugs)
                        I'm a thrill seeker, what can I
                        say?
 
              The playful smile never leaves his face. She's clearly amazed
              at the guts it takes to do what he does.
 
              Tuck leans in close over her shoulder as she stares at
              another picture.
 
                                  TUCK
                        Impressed?
 
              She's not spooked by how close he is. She doesn't want to let
              on that she's impressed though.

                                  LYNN
                        I don't really like roller
                        coasters.
 
              He's non-plussed. He moves past her down the hall toward an
              exit door.
 
                                  TUCK
                        How do you feel about...
 
              He opens the door and flicks on the light. It's a giant game
              room. A pool table in the center. A twenty foot shuffleboard
              game to the side. A big screen TV in the corner with a sofa
              in front of it. A refrigerator, the works.
 
                                  TUCK
                        ...shuffleboard?
 
              She follows him into the room. It's getting harder and harder
              to hide being impressed.
 
                                  TUCK
                        Can I get you a beer?
 
              He's at the fridge. Lynn has a moment. Put a halt to it right
              now, before it all gets out of hand. The reasons are many: In
              the middle of a divorce, Tuck is younger than she is, she's
              got a kid. She doesn't even really know this guy.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Sure.
 
                                  TUCK
                               (as he's getting them)
                        So how'd you get set up at the
                        gallery?
 
                                  LYNN
                        Oh, Phillip owns it.
 
                                  TUCK
                        Seems awfully young to own an art
                        gallery, doesn't he? I picture
                        gallery owners as, you know, over
                        fifty.
 
                                  LYNN
                        He inherited it when his parents
                        died.
                               (sheepish)
                        It seems funny now, but I actually
                        met him...on the internet. An art
                        forum.

                        When he found out I was in the
                        same city, and a painter...he
                        offered to take a look at my stuff.
 
                                  TUCK
                        I guess he liked it.
 
                                  LYNN
                               (nods)
                        We've had a bunch of showings, but
                        none went like tonight.
 
              For a second she looks like she thinks she shouldn't have
              said that. She breaks eye contact, but quickly looks back and
              smiles.
 
                                  TUCK
                        So how about a game of pool?
 
              EXT. TUCK'S OFFICE - LATER
 
              Tuck locks up the office behind them as they leave.
 
                                  TUCK
                        Not to sound sexist, but for a
                        girl, you're pretty good at pool.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Not to sound sexist?
 
                                  TUCK
                        Yeah, that's why I prefaced it
                        that way.
 
              From around a bush steps a MUGGER. He's mean-faced and alert.
              All business.
 
                                  MUGGER
                        Gimme your money.
 
              Tuck moves protectively in front of Lynn. The mugger's not
              intimidated, more interested in Lynn.
 
                                  MUGGER
                        Gimme the purse and there won't be
                        no trouble.
 
              Tuck eyes the mugger for a moment, then holds his hand out to
              Lynn. She gives him the purse.
 
              He tosses it to the mugger, who catches it in his knifeless
              hand. The mugger reaches in, pulls out the wallet and pockets
              it. He smiles a little more confidently.

                                  MUGGER
                        What else she got?
 
                                  TUCK
                        You got the money. Get out of
                        here.
 
                                  MUGGER
                        I think you best run off,
                        loverboy. I'll see her home.
 
                                  TUCK
                        Take the easy score. It's all
                        downhill from here.
 
              The mugger edges in. Tuck pushes Lynn back farther.
 
                                  TUCK
                               (never taking his
                                eyes off the mugger)
                        When you get the chance Lynn,
                        throw a rock at my office window.
 
              The mugger rushes. He feints and slashes across Tuck's
              stomach. Tuck jumps back, but there's a rip across his shirt
              now.
 
              Holding the knife up, the mugger admires the thin red coat
              now along one side.
 
                                  MUGGER
                        Wanna reconsider, loverboy?
 
              Nothing from Tuck. Still riveted on the mugger.
 
              The mugger takes two steps and jabs the knife. Tuck steps to
              the side, grabs the mugger's hand and jams an elbow into his
              side.
 
              The instant Tuck grabs the mugger's arm, LYNN HURLS HER
              KEYCHAIN, five pounds of keys, at the office door. It doesn't
              shatter the window, but spider-web cracks appear and a LOUD
              ALARM BEGINS GOING OFF inside.
 
              When Tuck elbows the mugger, he drops the knife. Tuck uses
              his weight to whirl the mugger away from him, causing him to
              tumble off balance and fall. A METALLIC CLATTER as a gun
              falls out of the mugger's waistband.
 
              The mugger snatches the gun.
 
                                  TUCK
                        Run!

              Lynn and Tuck run off toward the end of the building.
 
              The mugger briefly points his gun at the fleeing couple, but
              something keeps him from firing. He's pissed. He spares one
              irritated glance toward where the alarm is WAILING, and he
              runs off in the other direction.
 
                                                       DISSOLVE TO:
 
              INT. CAR - LATER
 
              Tuck's car pulls up in front of the house Lynn's staying in.
              Lynn, exhausted, doesn't move to open the door right away.
              She stares at the house.
 
                                  TUCK
                        You sure you're all right? I can
                        take you to a friend's house...
 
                                  LYNN
                        I'm okay. You're the one who got
                        stabbed.
 
                                  TUCK
                        Slashed, not stabbed. I've done
                        worse shaving.
 
              Lynn nods absently as if she's not even listening. She
              reaches for the door handle.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Well...good night.
 
                                  TUCK
                        Hey.
 
              He grabs her arm gently.
 
                                  TUCK
                        I'll call you tomorrow.
 
              She barely nods, gets out of the car and walks to her house.
              Tuck waits until she's in the house before he pulls away.
 
              INT. HOUSE
 
              Lynn leans back against the front door and closes her eyes.
              Exhausted. With the mugging on top of her exhibit, it's just
              too much. She's ready to drop.
 
              She trudges into the kitchen and pours herself a glass of
              wine. The PHONE RINGS.

              She spares a look at the clock--pretty late for a call--and
              picks up the phone.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Hello?
 
              Behind her, something outside moves past the kitchen windows.
 
                                  PHILLIP (PHONE)
                        Lynn?
 
                                  LYNN
                        Phillip? What are you doing up
                        this late?
 
              A non-rhythmic tapping can be heard coming from somewhere in
              the other room. Like a branch against a window.
 
                                  PHILLIP (PHONE)
                        You've had me worried sick. I've
                        called ten times since eleven
                        o'clock.
 
                                  LYNN
                        But...why?
 
                                  PHILLIP (PHONE)
                        You leave the exhibit with some
                        strange man you don't even know,
                        and you wonder why I'm worrying?
 
                                  LYNN
                        You're right. I'm sorry.
 
                                  PHILLIP
                        Where have you been all this time?
 
              Lynn notices the tapping. She moves into the television room.
              The tapping seems to be coming from outside the sliding glass
              door.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Long story. Long long story.
 
              She can't see anything outside the window, it's so dark.
 
                                  LYNN
                        You'll never believe what happened.
 
              She flicks on the lightswitch next to the door.
 
              The clown stands there revealed in the light. Like Lynn's
              worst nightmare, like the clown in the painting Tuck pointed
              out, the one that Lynn paints often, the one from her dream.

              His pupil-less eyes, however, are black as night. The
              soulless eyes of a shark.
 
              He's staring right at Lynn.
 
                                  PHILLIP (PHONE)
                        What? What happened?
 
              The clown cocks his head and leans closer, his breath fogging
              the glass. Lynn faints, the phone dropping uselessly to the
              rug.
 
              With a rumble, the sliding glass door opens to the clown's
              pull. He steps inside the house.
 
                                  PHILLIP (PHONE)
                        Lynn? Hello?
 
                                                       FADE OUT:
 
              From the BLACK comes voices. Echoes, distant and distorted.
 
                                  VOICE
                               (coming into focus)
                        Can you hear me? Miss Blodgett,
                        can you open your eyes?
 
              LYNN'S POV
 
              as she opens her eyes. Someone's leaning over her waving
              something under her nose. It's a MEDIC.
 
                                  MEDIC
                        You with me now?
 
                                  LYNN
                        Yes...
 
              She sits up with his help.
 
                                  MEDIC
                        Do you feel okay? Does anything
                        hurt?
 
                                  LYNN
                        No. I don't think so.
 
                                  MEDIC
                        Did you hit your head when you
                        fell?
 
              Lynn sees there's a COP standing behind the medic listening.
              His presence distracts her for a moment.

                                  LYNN
                        Uh...no. I don't think so.
 
                                  MEDIC
                        Do you want to go to the hospital?
 
                                  LYNN
                        No. I'm all right.
 
              The medic nods and begins to pack up his things as Lynn moves
              to a chair. The cop steps forward.
 
                                  COP
                        So what happened?
 
                                  LYNN
                        I--
                               (the remembrance
                                floods back)
                        --there was someone standing
                        outside my back door.
 
                                  COP
                        Right here?
 
              He points to the sliding glass door which is open about two
              inches.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Yes.
 
                                  COP
                        It was open when we got here.
 
              Lynn's eyes widen. It was open? It--the clown--came into the
              house?
 
                                  COP
                        We'll search the house. I don't
                        think anyone else is here though.
 
                                  LYNN
                        How did you know to come?
 
                                  COP
                        A friend of yours called. Said he
                        was talking to you on the phone
                        and it sounded like you collapsed.
                        Can you describe the guy that was
                        outside your door?
 
                                  LYNN
                        He was dressed like a clown.

                                  COP
                        What? A what?
 
              There's a TAP on the front screen door. They look to see
              Detective Peters letting himself in.
 
                                  COP
                               (to Lynn)
                        'Scuse me a minute.
 
              He intercepts Peters before he can make it over. There's
              HUSHED CONVERSATION between them ending in a questioning
              glance to the cop, who shrugs.
 
              Detective Peters comes over and sits down across from Lynn.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Don't you ever sleep?
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        Not so much. You say you saw
                        someone outside?
 
                                  LYNN
                        Yes. Right outside the glass when
                        I turned on the light.
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        And was he black or white?
 
                                  LYNN
                        He was a clown.
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        A clown?
 
                                  LYNN
                        Yes.
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        There was a clown standing outside
                        your window at one a.m.?
 
                                  LYNN
                               (knowing how it
                                sounds)
                        Yes.
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        Was he lost? Wandered away from
                        Barnum & Bailey's and got trapped
                        in suburbia?

              She says nothing, just glares back at him. He purses his lips
              thoughtfully.
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        This a P.R. stunt?
 
                                  LYNN
                               (confused)
                        What?
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        I know what you do, Miss Blodgett.
                               (off of her "so
                                what?" look)
                        You paint pictures. Of clowns.
                        This some kind of publicity stunt?
 
                                  LYNN
                        Does it look like a publicity
                        stunt?
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        No. But looks can be deceiving.
 
                                  LYNN
                               (getting mad)
                        That's great. How profound. I'd
                        like you to leave.
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        No need to be rude.
 
              The cop catches his eye.
 
                                  COP
                        The house is all clear.
 
              Peters nods.
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        I'm just saying, if this is some
                        stunt, it's a serious crime to
                        call the police.
 
                                  LYNN
                        I didn't call the police.
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        I know, I know. Your friend did.
                        The guy that owns a gallery full
                        of your clown paintings.
 
              He stands up.

                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        I'll be talking to you soon. I've
                        got some other questions.
 
              Lynn doesn't say anything. She follows them to the door.
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        'Night.
 
              Lynn shuts the door without a word. She stands there, the
              thoughts running wild through her exhausted head.
 
                                                       DISSOLVE TO:
 
              INT. GALLERY - DAY
 
              Lynn walks in, holding hands with her son NICHOLAS, aka
              Nicky. He's about five years old.
 
              Phillip, Amanda, and MR. PARRISH turn from one of Lynn's
              paintings toward her. Mr. Parrish is a distinguished older
              man, dressed very well and holding a cane, though he doesn't
              appear to need it.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Hey...what's going on?
 
                                  MR. PARRISH
                        Have you ever been spanked by a
                        clown, Miss Blodgett?
 
              Lynn doesn't know whether to laugh or be offended.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Excuse me?
 
              Mr. Parrish hands her a photograph. In the photo is a clown
              mugging for the camera with a bunch of kids at a birthday
              party.
 
                                  MR. PARRISH
                        My father. He used to be a clown
                        for neighborhood birthday parties.
                        A very strange thing. This man who
                        brings joy and smiles to everyone
                        around him...is also the man who
                        comes home and spanks you...hits
                        you with his hand or his belt. Not
                        happy to do it, mind you, but
                        doing his duty as a father
                        punishing a son.
 
              Lynn's listening patiently, but can't see where he's going.

                                  MR. PARRISH
                        You paint magnificently. I don't
                        like the ones with the frightening
                        clowns though. I don't know why
                        you waste your time with those.
                        But the ones like this...
 
              He points to the one they were all admiring when Lynn came
              in. The clown in the painting gazes sadly on the wilted
              flower in his hand.
 
                                  MR. PARRISH
                        Incredible. Perfect. His
                        expression...I want you to capture
                        that for me.
 
                                  LYNN
                        I'm sorry, Mr...
 
                                  MR. PARRISH
                        Parrish. Endle Parrish.
 
                                  LYNN
                        I'm sorry, Mr. Parrish, I don't
                        know what you're talking about.
 
                                  MR. PARRISH
                        I want you to paint a picture of
                        my father. I want you to show me
                        a clown saddened that he has to
                        spank his son.
 
              Lynn's expression says it all. How strange. Lynn looks to
              Phillip or Amanda for support. Neither says anything, but
              they're smiling. Like something else is coming.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Mr. Parrish, I'm sorry but I don't
                        do commission pieces. I'm not even
                        sure I could--
 
                                  MR. PARRISH
                        Ten thousand dollars. Cash if
                        you'd like.
 
              She's speechless for a moment. Even Phillip and Amanda are
              shocked. They knew the guy was loaded, but that's more than
              even they expected.
 
                                  LYNN
                        I don't, I mean, I could sell you
                        that one for a lot less.

                                  MR. PARRISH
                        No. It has to look like my father.
                        I want an original painting of my
                        father and I need it in three days.
 
                                  LYNN
                        That's just impossible. I can
                        recommend a number of excellent
                        painters--
 
                                  MR. PARRISH
                        No. It must be you.
 
                                  LYNN
                        I'm sorry, I can't do it.
 
                                  MR. PARRISH
                        Twenty thousand dollars. That's my
                        final offer.
 
                                  LYNN
                        You don't understand--
 
                                  PHILLIP
                        Lynn, could we speak to you for a
                        moment?
 
                                  LYNN
                               (to Amanda regarding
                                Nick)
                        Can you keep an eye on him?
 
              Amanda nods. Nicky's happy playing with his action figures on
              a bench.
 
              Phillip pulls her into the other room, leaving Mr. Parrish to
              gaze at her paintings.
 
                                  LYNN
                        I can't, Phillip. I don't have the
                        time right now.
 
                                  PHILLIP
                        Make the time. You can't be too
                        busy for that kind of money.
 
                                  LYNN
                        I am. I'm getting divorced. That's
                        why I'm going to move. Get away,
                        get a new start.
 
              He doesn't act surprised. Either that, or he doesn't think it
              matters.

                                  PHILLIP
                        You've got to think this through,
                        Lynn. Can you imagine what this is
                        going to do for your other
                        paintings? For your reputation?
                        Once people hear Mr. Parrish paid
                        twenty thousand for one of your
                        paintings, it will open the flood
                        gates. You won't be consigned to
                        showing your paintings in my
                        gallery...you'll be all over the
                        country.
 
              Lynn's starting to see the picture.
 
                                  LYNN
                        I'm not sure I can do it.
 
                                  PHILLIP
                        Of course you can.
 
              She's not so sure. She gives him one more unsure look before
              going back into the other room.
 
                                  MR. PARRISH
                        You'll do it?
 
                                  LYNN
                        I can't promise you I'll get it
                        done.
 
              He ignores her.
 
                                  MR. PARRISH
                               (handing her the
                                photo again)
                        Excellent. My phone number is on
                        the back. Call me when you've
                        finished and let me know how you'd
                        like the payment.
 
              She takes it. Mr. Parrish hangs the cane on the crook of his
              arm, and if he had a hat, he'd probably doff it.
 
                                  MR. PARRISH
                        Good day.
 
              He swaggers out.
 
                                  AMANDA
                               (in awe)
                        Twenty thousand dollars...that'll
                        buy a lot of bandwidth.

              Neither Phillip nor Lynn know what she's talking about.
 
                                  AMANDA
                        Tres geek, huh?
 
                                  LYNN
                        Yeah.
 
                                  PHILLIP
                        What happened last night? I called
                        the police but wouldn't tell me
                        anything.
 
                                  LYNN
                        I'm sorry. I don't even know where
                        to start.
 
                                  AMANDA
                               (totally in the dark)
                        What? What happened?
 
                                  LYNN
                        You'll never believe it...get me
                        some coffee and I'll tell you
                        about it.
 
              EXT. BASEMENT - DAY
 
              The backyard of a run-down house. Concrete stairs lead down
              the back to a basement door.
 
              A noise. Like a MUFFLED SHOUT followed by a dull THWACK. It's
              coming from inside the house.
 
              INT. BASEMENT
 
              The basement is dark and bare, undecorated cinderblock walls.
              The concrete floor is uncarpeted. A thin mattress sits in the
              corner surrounded by opened soda cans and other trash. The
              windows are covered so that the only light is from a bulb in
              the ceiling.
 
              A simple wooden table stands in the center of the room, an
              answering machine sitting on top of it. Next to the table is
              a wooden stump.
 
              The clown, breathing heavily, holds an axe.
 
              No warning. He swings the axe into the stump as hard as he
              can, YELLING like a savage.
 
                                  CLOWN
                        GEEEEEEEEEEEEHHHHHT!

              He pulls the axe out, mumbling as he exhales from the effort.
 
                                  CLOWN
                        --better.
 
              Again he swings the axe, again the YELL.
 
                                  CLOWN
                        GET!
 
              Pulls it out.
 
                                  CLOWN
                        Better.
 
              Over and over again, reciting the litany, a cruel smile on
              his face.
 
              INT. GALLERY - LATER
 
              Lynn and her friends have retired to the more comfortable
              reception area. Nick has his action figures battling
              underneath the magazine table.
 
                                  LYNN
                        The police took our statements,
                        but it didn't seem like they
                        thought they'd catch him.
 
                                  AMANDA
                        That's a really nice area. I can't
                        believe someone mugged you.
 
                                  PHILLIP
                        What happened when I called you?
 
              Lynn has an internal debate. She decides to spare herself the
              embarrassment of the clown story.
 
                                  LYNN
                        I don't know. I guess it all just
                        caught up to me. I must have
                        passed out.
 
                                  AMANDA
                        You passed out? What's that like?
 
                                  LYNN
                        It felt a lot like hitting the
                        floor.

                                  PHILLIP
                        You need to take it easy, Lynn.
                        And I don't think that includes
                        leaving with strange men at night.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Is that you, dad?
 
                                  AMANDA
                        He's right. You should stay away
                        from that guy.
                               (beat)
                        Give me his phone number and I'll
                        pass him the message.
 
              Lynn smirks at her.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Anyway. I have to get going to the
                        mediation. You're sure you're all
                        right with watching Nicky for an
                        hour?
 
                                  AMANDA
                        Not a problem. I don't have class
                        until four.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Great. Thanks a lot.
 
                                  AMANDA
                        Don't thank me. I'm billing you.
 
                                  PHILLIP
                        What exactly is supposed to happen
                        at this mediation?
 
                                  LYNN
                               (shrugs)
                        I'm not sure. I think we have to
                        sit down and decide who gets what,
                        and what his visitation rights are
                        going to be.
 
              INT. MEDIATION ROOM - DAY
 
              A sterile meeting room with a lacquered table and office
              chairs. There's a sweating metal pitcher of water at the
              center of the table.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Are you out of your fucking mind?

              Lynn and her lawyer MARTY are on one side, Bert and his
              lawyer OSBOURNE across from them. The MEDIATOR, a man with a
              wooden face, sits at the head of the table.
 
                                  MEDIATOR
                        Mind the language please.
 
              Osbourne's a no-nonsense older man and looks like he's
              accustomed to taking apart multi-million dollar corporations
              before breakfast.
 
                                  OSBOURNE
                        That's what we want. Sole custody
                        of Nicholas. Half of the ownership
                        of every painting you've created
                        since you married, or half the
                        price if you've sold them already.
                        You can keep your car. Bert won't
                        ask for any palimony, but you'll
                        have to pay child support.
 
              Lynn looks at Marty in disbelief, then back at Bert.
 
                                  LYNN
                        You can kiss my ass.
 
                                  MEDIATOR
                        Miss Blodgett, that's not helpful.
 
                                  OSBOURNE
                        And please direct your comments to
                        me.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Why? Is he too chickenshit to talk
                        to me?
                               (shakes her head)
                        I can't believe I'm hearing this.
                        Marty?
 
              Marty seems like more of your public defender type attorney.
 
                                  MARTY
                        That's not going to fly, guys.
                        Lynn gets sole custody. Full
                        alimony and child support. Bert
                        can keep his house--
 
                                  OSBOURNE
                        The house was his before the
                        marriage. It's not in her name at
                        all. Our terms aren't negotiable,
                        Marty.

                        Your client has no home--very
                        unstable for the child. If she
                        tries to buy one before the
                        divorce goes through, we'll pursue
                        half of it.
 
                                  LYNN
                               (to Bert)
                        Oh my God...
 
              Osbourne tries a sympathetic smile and fails.
 
                                  OSBOURNE
                               (to Marty)
                        You don't want to play hardball
                        with me. I'm short stop in the
                        majors, and you couldn't play
                        outfield in the minors.
 
              Marty knows he's outclassed.
 
                                  MARTY
                        We just want a fair deal,
                        Osbourne. That's all we're looking
                        for.
 
                                  OSBOURNE
                        We're offering you a fair deal.
 
                                  MARTY
                        He wants her to pay child
                        support? He's a doctor, for
                        godsakes.
 
                                  OSBOURNE
                        He's been unemployed for over six
                        months.
 
                                  LYNN
                        What? What's he been doing?
 
                                  OSBOURNE
                        It's not your business.
 
                                  LYNN
                        It's not my business? He's still
                        my husband, you son of a bitch.
                        Where has he been going everyday?
 
                                  MEDIATOR
                        Please, Miss--

                                  LYNN
                        No! I want an answer. Where the
                        hell has my husband been going
                        every day for the past six months
                        if he wasn't going to work?
 
                                  MEDIATOR
                        Okay, let's call it a day.
 
              Lynn slams her hand on the table.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Bullshit!
 
              Marty touches her arm and raises his eyebrows to let her know
              she's getting out of line. She takes a moment to calm down.
 
                                  MEDIATOR
                        Let's meet Monday after everyone's
                        had a chance to cool down.
 
                                  MARTY
                               (before Lynn can
                                speak)
                        Sounds good.
 
              He reaches across to shake Osbourne's hand, but Osbourne only
              nods and begins packing his papers into his briefcase.
 
                                  OSBOURNE
                        I'll fax our terms to your office.
                        You do have a fax machine?
 
                                  MARTY
                        Of course.
 
              Osbourne nods and guides Bert out of the office. Neither meet
              Lynn's smoldering gaze.
 
                                  LYNN
                        You really stuck it to him, Marty.
 
              He's surprised by her attack.
 
                                  MARTY
                        What? What do you mean?
 
              Lynn doesn't respond. She fights back tears.
 
                                  LYNN
                        I'm not losing Nicholas. I can't
                        lose him.

                                  MARTY
                        It'll be all right. We'll get him.
 
              She doesn't look reassured.
 
              INT. BASEMENT - DAY
 
              It's the dark basement again. Same table. Same answering
              machine on the table, but the red light is blinking now.
 
              The clown stands in front of the table staring at the light.
              The red casts a dull reflection in his black eyes.
 
              He pushes the button. The voice that issues from the machine
              is deep and electronically altered.
 
                                  VOICE (FROM MACHINE)
                        You want to get better, don't you?
 
              The clown nods imperceptibly.
 
                                  VOICE (FROM MACHINE)
                        You are getting better. Not much
                        longer and you'll be cured. But
                        first...take the van.
 
                                  CLOWN
                        The murder van...
 
              There's a pause as the voice seems to consider this. Is it an
              answering machine or some kind of intercom?
 
                                  VOICE (FROM MACHINE)
                        Do not kill her. Follow her.
                        Frighten her. Make her doubt her
                        own sanity. But do not harm
                        her...yet. Let no one else see
                        you. Go.
 
              The clown turns and leaves.
 
              INT. HOUSE - DAY
 
              Lynn walks in, her cel phone to her ear.
 
                                  LYNN
                        I'm not kidding you. He's going
                        for full custody, Julie. He wants
                        me to pay him.
 
                                  JULIE (PHONE)
                        That bastard.

                                  LYNN
                        God, I feel like I'm having a
                        nervous breakdown. I'm telling
                        you...there was a clown outside my
                        door last night.
 
                                  JULIE (PHONE)
                        You said that. You were probably
                        just exhausted.
 
                                  LYNN
                        I feel like I'm living in a
                        nightmare, Julie.
 
                                  JULIE (PHONE)
                        Just take some deep breaths. So
                        what are you going to do?
 
                                  LYNN
                        I'm going to paint that picture
                        for Mr. Parrish. Then I'm going to
                        use that money to hire the best
                        attorney in town to kick his
                        lawyer's ass!
 
                                  JULIE (PHONE)
                        That a girl!
 
                                  LYNN
                        Hey, I got someone calling on the
                        other line, could be my lawyer.
                        Can I call you back later?
 
                                  JULIE (PHONE)
                        Sure thing. Talk to you soon.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Bye.
                               (clicks a button)
                        Hello?
 
                                  TUCK (PHONE)
                        Lynn. It's Tuck.
 
              Lynn smiles. Even with the events of the day, Tuck can bring
              a smile to her face. She's got it bad for him.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Hi. How are you?
 
                                  TUCK (PHONE)
                        I was gonna ask you the same thing.

                                  LYNN
                        I'm okay. I mean, about last
                        night. It's just, well there's
                        other stuff--
 
                                  TUCK (PHONE)
                        Wanna go get a bite to eat?
 
              She's tempted, but there's so much to do.
 
                                  LYNN
                        I'd like to, but--
 
              There's a KNOCK on the door.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Hold on a minute.
 
              She goes to the door and opens it. Tuck's standing there, his
              cel phone to his ear. He's got his mischievous smile in place.
 
                                  TUCK
                               (into phone)
                        Hey Lynn, can I call you back?
 
              Lynn smiles and plays his game.
 
                                  LYNN
                               (into phone)
                        Sure.
 
              They both hang up. Lynn opens the screen door for him.
 
                                  TUCK
                        So I was thinking...the circus is
                        in town and if you wanted to go
                        see some friendly clowns for
                        once...
 
              That idea doesn't thrill Lynn.
 
                                  LYNN
                        I don't think so.
 
                                  TUCK
                        Why are you so afraid of clowns?
 
                                  LYNN
                        I'm not afraid of them.
 
                                  TUCK
                        You are too.

                                  LYNN
                        I am not. Just because I paint
                        them--
 
                                  TUCK
                        Just because you paint scary
                        clowns. Only scary clowns.
 
              Lynn walks away, picks her mail off the table and busies
              herself sorting it.
 
                                  LYNN
                        That doesn't mean I'm scared of
                        them.
 
                                  TUCK
                        What does it mean then?
 
              That stumps Lynn.
 
                                  TUCK
                        It's okay. There's even a word for
                        it. Coulrophobia.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Coulrophobia?
 
                                  TUCK
                        Fear of clowns. Lot of people have
                        it.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Really?
 
                                  TUCK
                        I'm not smart enough to make up a
                        word like that.
 
                                  LYNN
                        So what are you afraid of?
 
              He takes a moment. A playful smile on his face. Weighing the
              moment; to tell the truth or lie?
 
                                  TUCK
                        Silence. Being alone.
 
              He's still smiling. But something in his eyes is daring her
              to understand his words.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Lots of people feel that way. So
                        how could you possibly be alone?

              He doesn't answer.
 
                                  TUCK
                        Want to do something strange?
 
                                  LYNN
                        That's a loaded question.
 
                                  TUCK
                        You like to take pictures?
 
                                  LYNN
                        Sure. I do a lot of photo-
                        referencing.
 
                                  TUCK
                        Grab your camera. Come on.
 
              Again, she knows she shouldn't be doing it. There's something
              about him that draws her though. Like a moth to the flame.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Okay. Just let me call Amanda
                        first...
 
              EXT. HOUSE
 
              Today, Tuck has his motorcycle, a sleek black machine that
              looks built for speed.
 
                                  LYNN
                        On that?
 
                                  TUCK
                        Perfectly safe.
 
              He hands her a helmet. He hops on and helps her mount the
              bike behind him.
 
                                  TUCK
                        Hold on.
 
              He starts the motorcycle and ROARS off, Lynn gripping him
              tightly around the waist.
 
              Behind them, a van with tinted-black windows starts up and
              pulls out.
 
              EXT. WOODS - DAY
 
              Tuck pulls his cycle into a cul-de-sac off of the main road.
              A high fence runs the entire length of the road, but there's
              a hole in it where it curves for the cul-de-sac.

              He helps Lynn off and stacks the helmets on the back.
 
                                  TUCK
                        Come on.
 
              He leads her to the hole and helps her climb through.
 
              Once through, they're in a wooded area. Lots of trees and ivy
              and overgrowth.
 
              Tuck takes her hand and leads her.
 
              EXT. LAND OF MYTH
 
              They emerge from the woods into a huge clear area. Everywhere
              you look is the remnants of what used to be a theme park
              devoted to fairy tales.
 
              A plastic statue of Jack(no sign of Jill) lies on the ground
              covered by weeds. A tall beanstalk like the one Jack might
              have climbed(had his been made of metal) creeps up to the sky
              but doesn't go as far as it used to. A castle that was once
              pristine is falling to ruin and ivy threatens to pull down
              its every wall.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Where are we?
 
                                  TUCK
                        It was called The Land Of Myth.
                        They closed it down about fifteen
                        years ago.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Oh my God...I've been here. As a
                        kid.
 
                                  TUCK
                        Me too. It was popular for a while.
 
              As they talk, they're walking through what's left of the
              displays. Lynn begins taking pictures.
 
                                  TUCK
                        Kind of creepy now, isn't it?
 
                                  LYNN
                        Tell you the truth, I thought it
                        was kind of creepy back then.
 
                                  TUCK
                        You did?

                                  LYNN
                        Something about it gave me the
                        willies. But now, to see it like
                        this...why did they leave
                        everything here?
 
                                  TUCK
                        Don't know. Maybe it was hard to
                        move. Maybe no one wanted it.
 
              She keeps snapping pics.
 
                                  TUCK
                        We'll have to compare pictures
                        sometime.
 
                                  LYNN
                        You take pictures?
 
                                  TUCK
                        Yep. I took a lot of photography
                        classes in college.
 
                                  LYNN
                        I wish I'd brought some black and
                        white film.
 
                                  TUCK
                        It's okay, you can make them black
                        and white with a computer.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Really?
 
                                  TUCK
                        Sure. You can do just about
                        anything with a computer.
 
              There is movement behind them as the clown peers from around
              one of the exhibits.
 
              Lynn says nothing. She's mulling over something in her mind.
              Tuck senses it and gives her time, just keeps checking out
              all the relics.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Listen. I have to level with you.
                        My life is kind of a train wreck
                        right now.
 
                                  TUCK
                        So?

                                  LYNN
                        Well...what are we doing?
 
                                  TUCK
                               (shrugs)
                        Getting to know each other.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Why?
 
              Tuck's playing stupid.
 
                                  TUCK
                        What do you mean, why?
 
                                  LYNN
                        Come on. I'm attracted to you and
                        I think you're attracted to me.
                        But this is...it's just a bad time.
 
                                  TUCK
                               (playing stupid)
                        You're attracted to me?
 
              Lynn stops walking and smirks at him until he gives.
 
                                  TUCK
                        Okay okay. So we're past the
                        subtext. What's the problem?
 
                                  LYNN
                        It's really complicated.
 
                                  TUCK
                        You said that already. You're
                        getting divorced. What's
                        complicated?
 
                                  LYNN
                        You asked for it.
 
                                  TUCK
                        Give it to me.
 
              CLOWN POV
 
              He's stalking them. They continue to talk, oblivious of the
              fact that there's a psychotic clown standing fifty feet
              behind them.
 
              He moves closer still.
 
              RESUME

                                  LYNN
                        --and he's trying to take my son
                        away from me.
 
                                  TUCK
                        Why is the house still in his ex-
                        wife's name? How long's it been
                        since he was married to her?
 
                                  LYNN
                        Ten years.
 
                                  TUCK
                        That's...strange.
 
                                  LYNN
                        That's not even the half of it.
                        Now I find out that he hasn't been
                        working for the better part of a
                        year. He'd leave the house
                        everyday, but where he went...?
 
                                  TUCK
                        Jesus.
 
                                  LYNN
                        See, I have a lot of stuff to work
                        out before I can even...you know.
 
              Tuck only smiles.
 
                                  LYNN
                        I should have known, I mean he's
                        a man with a cat. Single men with
                        cats are bad news. At least,
                        that's what the magazines say.
 
                                  TUCK
                               (laughs)
                        Did you get enough pictures?
 
                                  LYNN
                        Ready to go?
 
              He nods. They head back the way they came, not seeing the
              clown as he circles around a structure to keep out of their
              sight. At one point, he's close enough to reach out and touch
              them.
 
              BACK AT THE MOTORCYCLE
 
              Lynn climbs on back as Tuck pulls on his driving gloves. He
              straightens the motorcycle, and in the side mirror the clown
              ducks back into the bushes.

                                  TUCK
                        Ready?
 
              She grabs him around the stomach.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Yeah.
 
              He takes off.
 
                                                       DISSOLVE TO:
 
              EXT. HOUSE - LATER
 
              Tuck pulls his cycle up to the curb and turns it off. She
              hops off just as Detective Peters gets out of his car across
              the street. He looks like he's been waiting for a while.
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        Miss Blodgett?
 
              Lynn turns and sees him. Tuck does too, and something passes
              across his face. He can tell Peters is a cop, and there's
              instant friction. Like two alpha males trying to stake out
              their territory.
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        How you doing?
 
                                  LYNN
                        Fine.
 
              There's the briefest moment where the detective waits for
              Lynn to introduce him to Tuck. She doesn't, so he takes the
              initiative.
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        Detective Peters, homicide.
 
                                  TUCK
                        Homicide?
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        Yeah, that's when somebody dies.
 
                                  TUCK
                               (no shit)
                        Thanks.
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        There was a murder yesterday a few
                        doors down.

                               (looks to Lynn then
                                back to Tuck)
                        Now Miss Blodgett is seeing clowns
                        in her backyard.
 
              Tuck shoots Lynn a questioning look. She rolls her eyes, like
              she's tired of this guy. Tuck turns his attention back to
              Peters.
 
                                  TUCK
                        Takes a clown to catch a clown,
                        huh?
 
              He laughs like he's kidding, but Peters gets the jibe. He
              gives a little laugh, makes a show of examining Tuck's
              motorcycle.
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        You know what us cops call these?
 
                                  TUCK
                        No.
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        A donorcycle. Whenever there's an
                        accident with one of them, we pick
                        up the rider and his brain's all
                        scrambled but the rest of him is
                        A-okay. Perfect organ donor.
 
              Tuck's not impressed.
 
                                  TUCK
                        You know what we call cops where
                        I come from?
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS

              He kick-starts the motorcycle and drives off, giving a wink
              to Lynn.

                        Why are you here then?
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        I'm a detective. I'm...detecting.

                               (tiring of it)
                        And what are you detecting?

                        ...I've got a funny feeling about
                        you, Miss Blodgett.

                        Well. Try and keep it in your
                        pants, would you?
 
              She turns on her heel and heads to her door. The detective
              watches her ass the entire way but makes no attempt to follow.

              Lynn's sketching from the picture of Parrish's father.
              Nothing fancy, just some concept sketches to get the look
              down.

              Lynn's got about ten pages of sketches next to her. Outside
              her window, night has fallen.
 
              But the sketch she's working on now is different. She's got
              colored pencils and charcoal, and is pencilling the clown she
              seems to be obsessed with.
 
              Except now his eyes are exactly like the one she saw outside
              her sliding-glass door the previous night. Black, reflecting
              a pinprick of light.

              She stops and takes a good look at her handiwork. Then
              realizes that she's put off her paying project to do more
              sketches of her obsession.

              She pushes it to the side and begins setting up her easel to
              paint.

              Amanda scrolls down, clicks. A new page pops up. Amanda

              She grabs the phone, casting a glance at the clock. Ten
              forty. Might be a little late with Lynn having Nicky.
              Disappointed, she hangs up the phone.
 
              With a click of the mouse, she opens up her email and begins
              writing. Just a quick note. She clicks SEND.

              The bathroom is steamy as Amanda steps out, one towel around
              her body as she uses another to dry her hair.

              She moves into her bedroom. The head towel gets tossed onto
              the bed. She begins blow-drying her hair with the electric
              hair dryer on her dresser.
 
              Casually. No hurry. She spares a glance at herself in the
              mirror as she blows her hair back. She notices the curtains
              of her room move gently in the breeze behind her.
 
              She frowns and switches off the dryer. She goes to the
              window. She has to climb onto the bed to get to it, and
              immediately there's a slight TINKLING of glass.
 
              Behind the bed lies broken glass. There doesn't seem to be
              any of it on the bedsheet.
 
              Amanda frowns even more. What the--?
 
              She pushes the curtain out of the way. There's a hole in her
              window about the size of a baseball. Or a fist.
 
              For a moment it really doesn't bother her. Some kid must have
              thrown something through her window.
 
              Then she sees her window screen lying in the grass outside,
              partially bent. She pushes curtains aside to look at the top
              of the window. It's unlocked.
 
              Her eyes go wide. She's frightened but not the kind prone to
              panic. She goes for the portable phone by her bed...it's not
              there. Just an empty cradle.
 
              She curses almost silently. Where did she put it?
 
              She takes a quick look around her bedroom but doesn't see it.
              Looking at the doorway leading into the dark hallway, she
              seems to have a hard time swallowing.
 
              She creeps to the doorway and listens for the sounds of an
              intruder.
 
              Silence. For one moment she's in indecision. Maybe it's
              nothing(she forgot to lock the window), could have been a
              baseball. If someone broke into her house he would have fled
              when he heard someone was home...
 
              INTO THE HALLWAY
 
              she moves slowly, one hand held to the towel around her body.
              She passes the living room(no one there) and gets to the
              kitchen. She quickly moves to the wall. Stops.
 
              Another empty cradle. No phone.

              That's strange. That's wrong. Sensing something in her
              peripheral vision she turns her head slightly.
 
              The clown stands in the opening between the kitchen and
              dining room.
 
              Amanda's startled, but only for a moment. And then, rather
              then being scared, she scoffs.
 
                                  AMANDA
                        What the hell are you supposed to
                        be?
 
              The axe, which had been hanging out of sight by his leg,
              THWACKS into the kitchen wall.
 
                                  CLOWN
                        Better.
 
              That does it. Amanda runs for the front door. The clown
              doesn't bother pulling his axe out of the wall. He moves
              quickly around the other side, intercepting her before she
              gets to the door.
 
              He grabs for her--only gets the towel--it comes loose. A now
              naked Amanda stumbles as the towel is jerked from her. The
              clown tosses it to the side and grabs her by the hair before
              she can scramble more than a few feet.
 
              He drags her struggling form back into the kitchen. He grabs
              her by the neck and SLAMS her back into the wall so her feet
              aren't touching the ground anymore.
 
              She's choking. Has to use both hands to keep from suffocating
              completely.
 
              The clown is suddenly aware of her nakedness. He runs a
              finger down from her shoulder to the curve of her breast. He
              studies her like he's never seen a naked women before.
 
              She makes a desperate grab at his face, raking her nails down
              one side of his cheek. The gashes aren't deep, but they take
              off some of his paint. He SLAMS her head against the wall.
 
              Casually he tosses her to the floor.
 
              She's choking, trying to get her air back. Weakly crawling
              backward away from him.
 
              He wrenches the axe from the wall.
 
              She tries to beg--can't talk, her larynx is crushed--puts an
              arm up.

              The clown takes a two handed grip on the axe. Getting ready
              to chop wood.
 
              He swings.

              Lynn's finished a painting. Very nice, but not as clean as
              her paintings on display. And it's missing something...some

                        addresses on both victims.

              Officer Patrick--behind him--clears his throat.
 
                                  OFFICER PATRICK
                        Assault and battery, huh?
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        Huh? No, attempted robbery.
 
                                  OFFICER PATRICK
                        That's three-twenty-one.
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        Nuh-uh.
 
                                  OFFICER PATRICK
                        Yeah.
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        Did they change it?
 
                                  OFFICER PATRICK
                        No. Always been three-twenty-one.
 
              Peters is miffed. This is the kind of shit that ruins his day.
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                               (into radio)

                               (into radio)
                        That three-twenty-two may be a
                        three-twenty-one.

                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                               (into radio)
                        I need info on an attempted
                        robbery. Whatever the number is.
                        One of the victims is named Lynn
                        Blodgett. I need the name and
                        address of the other.

                        Copy. Hold on.

                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                               (to Patrick,
                                frustrated)
                        Fuckin' codes.
 
                                                       DISSOLVE TO:
 
              INT. TUCK'S HOUSE - LATER
 
              Tuck and Lynn sit at the table, having just finished a lunch
              that probably should have been a dinner. Lynn leans back,
              patting her stomach.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Wow. I have to tell you, I'm
                        surprised.
 
                                  TUCK
                        Why?
 
                                  LYNN
                        You really don't strike me as the
                        kind of guy who can cook.
 
                                  TUCK
                        Ouch.
                               (picks up his plate
                                and hers)
                        Do I strike you as the kind who
                        can wash dishes?
 
                                  LYNN
                        Maybe with a dishwasher.
 
                                  TUCK
                        Make yourself at home while I
                        clean up.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Sure you don't want help?
 
                                  TUCK
                        I'll be all right.
 
              She wanders into what passes as a living room, but is more
              like a small museum. Bookshelves line one side, and a huge
              plush couch separates the entertainment center from it. A
              family of four could live in his big-screen T.V.
 
              She peruses his books while they talk back and forth between
              rooms.

                                  TUCK
                        You said you should be painting.
                        What are you working on? Wait, let
                        me guess: A clown.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Ha ha. Stick to cooking. I've got
                        a commission piece to do. Has to
                        be done in...well, two days now.
 
                                  TUCK
                        Not much time for a painting.
 
                                  LYNN
                        The money's supposed to make up
                        for it.
 
                                  TUCK
                        Can I ask what your going rate is?
 
                                  LYNN
                        For this piece, I'm getting twenty
                        thousand.
 
                                  TUCK
                        Ha! I told you that painting I
                        bought from you was a steal.
 
              Lynn's been flipping through occasional books. Tuck's
              interests are wide-ranging. There are a bunch of art books.
              On a lower shelf sits a stack of magazines. Lynn sees one she
              recognizes and pulls it out.
 
                                  LYNN
                        We'll see. I'm really not sure I
                        can do what the guy is asking.
 
                                  TUCK
                        What's he asking?
 
              Lynn flips through the magazine called "MODERN PAINTER" and
              sees a page which has been bent in to save the place.
 
                                  LYNN
                        A picture of his father.
 
              The page opens to reveal a large photo of Lynn, followed by
              an article about her.
 
                                  TUCK
                        Doesn't sound that tough.
 
              Lynn frowns. She was under the impression that Tuck knew
              nothing about her when they met.

              She flips to the front and notes that the magazine is months
              old and has a subscription label on it with Tuck's name and
              address. Not a recent buy.
 
                                  LYNN
                        His father was a clown and he
                        wants him to look a certain way.
 
              She grabs another magazine out of the stack. One called "ART
              GALLERY". There are two pages folded in. The first is a
              painting of hers with its name(MARY'S CLOWN) and her name
              under it. The second page shows a picture of her with a short
              biography next to it.
 
              Now she's alarmed.
 
                                  TUCK
                        I meant to ask you. You think it's
                        strange that guy tried to mug us
                        with a knife when he's got a gun
                        in his coat?
 
              She's doesn't want to panic. Ask him about it? Was their
              meeting just a chance thing, or has he been...stalking her?
 
                                  LYNN
                        Maybe it wasn't loaded.
 
                                  TUCK
                        We wouldn't have known that--
 
              He's interrupted by THE DOORBELL. Lynn hastily drops the Art
              Gallery mag on top of a pile of magazines next to the
              fireplace, then goes toward the front door as Tuck answers it.
 
              Detective Peters stands on the front stoop.
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        Lynn Blodgett here?
 
              Clearly, Tuck's not pleased that Peters has stopped by.
 
                                  TUCK
                        Yeah.
 
                                  LYNN
                               (steps into his line
                                of sight)
                        What is it, detective?
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        Could you come with me?

                                  TUCK
                        What's going on?
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        I need to talk to you, Miss
                        Blodgett. Let's go back to your
                        house.
 
              Since Peters is ignoring him, Tuck physically steps between
              Peters and Lynn.
 
                                  TUCK
                        What's going on?
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        You want to step out of the way?
 
                                  TUCK
                        You want to talk to my lawyer?
 
              Lynn puts a hand on his arm.
 
                                  LYNN
                        It's okay.
                               (to Peters)
                        I take it this is important?
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        Very.
 
              Tuck doesn't seem to notice that Lynn's a bit relieved to be
              getting away.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Thanks for a great lunch.
 
                                  TUCK
                        My pleasure. Give me a call later,
                        huh?
 
                                  LYNN
                        I will.
 
              OUTSIDE
 
              Detective Peters sees her to her car.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Can you tell me what's going on?
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        Not here.

                                  LYNN
                        Nicholas--my son--nothing's--
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        It's not about your son. Please
                        follow me back to your house.
 
              He heads to his car.
 
              INT. HOUSE - LATER
 
              Lynn and the detective enter. As they shut the door we can
              see Officer Patrick right outside the door.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Well?
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        Sit down. Please.
 
              He escorts her into the living room and gets her to sit on
              the couch.
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        Amanda Greene was murdered last
                        night.
 
              Her head jerks back like she was punched.
 
                                  LYNN
                        What?
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        I'm sorry, I know she worked for
                        you.
 
              She's a strong woman. Doesn't want to show her tears, so she
              fights them back.
 
                                  LYNN
                        She was my friend.
 
              It's the only thing she can get out. The tears course down
              her cheeks.
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        There's more. I wish I were better
                        with the tact, but I'm not.
 
                                  LYNN
                        What?

                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        The scene of--where she died...I
                        mean, it's not just that. We don't
                        have the coroner's report yet, but
                        I'd bet my shield that...
                               (licks his lips,
                                probably shouldn't
                                say anything)
                        ...well, I think the person that
                        killed your friend is the same
                        person that killed the family
                        three doors down from you.
 
                                  LYNN
                        What?
 
              She's having a hard time dealing with it. Any of it.
              Amanda...dead, killed...same as the neighbors...
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        I don't think it's a coincidence.
                        I think someone is zeroing in on
                        you.
 
              Lynn's too surprised to speak.
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        I've already said more than I
                        should. But there's more. I need
                        to know I have your complete
                        confidence, that you won't repeat
                        what I'm about to tell you. To
                        anyone.
 
              She nods, afraid to trust her voice.
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        Amanda fought back against the
                        person. We've recovered blood and
                        tissue from under her fingernails.
                        And...grease paint.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Paint?
 
              She's glancing at her paints next to her easel.
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        Grease paint. Like you'd buy in
                        any Halloween or costume shop.
 
                                  LYNN
                        I'm sorry, I just, I don't
                        understand.

              Peters take a photo out of his jacket pocket, not showing it
              to her yet.
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        The window that he entered from...
 
              He's not sure how to say it...he shrugs and hands her the
              photo.
 
              She looks at it, not comprehending what she's looking at. A
              window with a hole in it. But below that, smudged white and
              a red dot centered below it. Then it hits her. Her eyes widen
              in shock.
 
              She stands up and moves to her sketch pad. She flips it open
              to the clown--her clown--that she drew the night before. She
              holds the picture next to the sketch.
 
              It's pretty obvious that if her clown were real, and he
              pushed his face against a window, it would leave those marks.
              White forehead, red nose. Evil. Peering in Amanda's window.
              Just like he peered in her window.
 
              She holds the sketch and the photo out to Peters. He takes
              them, but it's like he already thought.
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        I admit that I didn't take you
                        seriously with your clown story
                        the other night.
 
                                  LYNN
                        To tell you the truth...I'd
                        convinced myself it was some
                        hallucination, or shock from being
                        mugged.
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        Well, you have my assurance that
                        I'm taking you deadly serious now.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Thank you.
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        This what he looked like when you
                        saw him?
 
                                  LYNN
                        Yes.
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        His eyes are black like that?

                                  LYNN
                        Yes.
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        Huh. Can I have this?
 
                                  LYNN
                        Yes.
 
              He stands, starts backing his way to the door.
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        Whoever this guy is...we'll get
                        him. You need to watch yourself
                        until we do though. I'll have
                        someone out in front of your house
                        at all times.
 
              Lynn stays strong, nods.
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        I'll call you if I come up with
                        anything.
 
              Once he's gone though, the tears flow. She weeps almost
              silently for her friend.
 
              EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY
 
              A car is parked under the shade of a tree. Bert's SAAB pulls
              in next to it, but during the conversation, the person in the
              other car can't be seen.
 
              Bert rolls his window down. He tries to act like he's
              watching something in front of him while he talks.
 
                                  BERT
                        What the hell is taking so long?
 
                                  HESTON
                        You don't want to take that tone
                        with me.
 
              The man's got a dangerous voice. Bert backs off.
 
                                  BERT
                        It was--you were supposed to have
                        done it by now.
 
                                  HESTON
                        Clearly, there's been a problem.
 
                                  BERT
                        And what is that?

                                  HESTON
                        First, the guy she's been hanging
                        out with. I could go around that.
                        Other problem, well, it's a clown.
 
                                  BERT
                        What?
 
                                  HESTON
                        There's a clown been following her.
 
                                  BERT
                        A clown?
 
                                  HESTON
                        For a shrink you don't hear so
                        good.
 
                                  BERT
                        Tell me about this...clown.
 
                                  HESTON
                        Only saw him once. Your wife and
                        her new beau went sightseeing at
                        an abandoned amusement park. The
                        clown followed them.
 
                                  BERT
                        What did he look like?
 
                                  HESTON
                        He looked like a clown. Face
                        paint. Frizzy thing around the
                        neck.
 
              Bert knows something. He stares forward for a moment,
              debating, but doesn't address it.
 
                                  BERT
                        So what's the problem?
 
                                  HESTON
                        People are getting killed all
                        around your soon-to-be-ex. The
                        cops are swarming.
 
                                  BERT
                        What are you talking about?
 
                                  HESTON
                        A family, couple doors down. Then
                        last night, a girl that works for
                        her.

                                  BERT
                        Amanda?
 
                                  HESTON
                        Whatever. My source in the
                        department says they got grease
                        paint off the window the perp came
                        in.
                               (on Bert's clueless
                                look)
                        Like clown makeup. This is gonna
                        take more money.
 
                                  BERT
                        I don't think so.
 
                                  HESTON
                        Your choice. I'll just take what
                        you've given me as a deposit for
                        services rendered. Have a nice
                        life.
 
              His car starts.
 
                                  BERT
                        Wait! How much more?
 
                                  HESTON
                        Hmmmm...psychotic clowns, cops
                        galore. Another ten.
 
              Bert winces. He's not happy about it.
 
                                  BERT
                        All right, but that's it. I can't
                        pay you any more.
 
              WE COME AROUND SO WE FINALLY SEE HESTON
 
                                  HESTON
                        The whole make-it-look-like-a-
                        mugging is out. Get your alibi
                        ready, doc. They're gonna question
                        you.
 
              Heston is the "mugger" who tried to rob Lynn and Tuck.
 
                                  HESTON
                        I'll do it when the money's
                        transferred. She's as good as dead.
 
              His car pulls away. Bert watches him drive off, but his mind
              is on something else. Something nagging at his brain like a
              name on the tip of your tongue.

              INT. GALLERY - LATER
 
              Lynn enters. All the make up in the world can't disguise the
              fact that she's been crying.
 
              Phillip's at the front desk doing paperwork. He sees her and
              rushes over.
 
                                  PHILLIP
                        Oh Lynn, I'm so sorry.
 
              He hugs her. She takes a couple of deep breaths, fights off
              the urge to cry again.
 
                                  LYNN
                        I'm okay.
 
                                  PHILLIP
                        You sure?
 
                                  LYNN
                               (wan smile)
                        Yeah. When did you find out?
 
                                  PHILLIP
                        About an hour ago. Some detective
                        came by to ask questions.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Detective Peters?
 
                                  PHILLIP
                        Yes. That was him.
 
              She shakes her head at his persistance.
 
                                  LYNN
                               (kidding)
                        I think he's been following me.
 
              Phillip's concerned.
 
                                  PHILLIP
                        Why would a detective be following
                        you?
 
                                  LYNN
                        I was joking. At least, a little.
                        He seems to pop up all the time.
 
                                  PHILLIP
                        That's strange...Oh, hey.
 
              He retrieves some papers from behind the counter.

                                  PHILLIP
                        I didn't show this to the
                        detective. I hope I won't get in
                        any trouble.
 
                                  LYNN
                        What is it?
 
                                  PHILLIP
                        Amanda sent us all an email last
                        night.
 
              Lynn looks at it.
 
                                  PHILLIP
                        It's about Mr. Parrish. His father
                        wasn't just a clown; he was a
                        convicted child molester. One of
                        the children disappeared, but they
                        could never prove he had anything
                        to do with it.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Oh my God...
 
                                  PHILLIP
                        The second page has some pictures.
 
              Lynn looks. The pictures are from the trial. One picture in
              particular sticks out: Mr. Parrish's father sitting behind
              the defendant's desk with a deep look of remorse on his face.
 
              Feeling overwhelmed, Lynn backs herself onto a bench.
 
                                  PHILLIP
                        I'm sorry, I should have waited to
                        show you--
 
                                  LYNN
                        No, it's all right Phillip. I have
                        to give this to the police. Amanda
                        sent this to us last night
                        sometime before...
                               (can't bring herself
                                to say it)
                        I have to give this to the
                        detective.
 
                                  PHILLIP
                        If you don't want to paint for
                        him, I understand.

                                  LYNN
                        I have to. I need the money.
                               (off his look)
                        I have to get a new lawyer. Bert's
                        trying to take Nicky away from me.
 
                                  PHILLIP
                        He can't do that...
 
                                  LYNN
                        He can.
                               (overwhelmed)
                        I just don't feel like I could
                        paint anything right now. I've got
                        cops in front of my house--
 
              The PHONE RINGING interrupts her. Phillip answers it.
 
                                  PHILLIP
                        Flinner Gallery. Oh, hello Mr.
                        Flynn...
 
              Lynn shakes her head: She's not here.
 
                                  PHILLIP
                        No, I haven't seen her today.
                               (beat)
                        I'll tell her you called when I
                        see her. Bye bye.
 
              He hangs up.
 
                                  PHILLIP
                        What's that all about?
 
                                  LYNN
                               (doesn't feel like
                                going into it)
                        I don't feel like talking to
                        anyone right now.
                               (occurs to her)
                        Hey, did he ever buy anything from
                        the gallery before?
 
                                  PHILLIP
                        Well...I don't think so.
 
              Her cel phone picks that moment to RING. She looks at the
              number: it's Tuck. She doesn't want to talk to him, but she
              doesn't want her phone to keep ringing.
 
              She puts up a finger to Phillip to give her a minute, and she
              moves off to talk.

              INTERCUT LYNN/TUCK
 
              Tuck's leaning against his car.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Hello.
 
                                  TUCK
                        Hey, there you are. I tried to
                        reach you at home and at the
                        gallery.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Yeah, I'm running around...
 
                                  TUCK
                        So, is everything okay? What did
                        that detective want?
 
                                  LYNN
                        Amanda, my assistant...she was
                        murdered last night.
 
                                  TUCK
                        ...what?
 
                                  LYNN
                        Someone attacked her in her house.
 
                                  TUCK
                        My God...Did they catch whoever
                        did it?
 
                                  LYNN
                        No.
 
                                  TUCK
                        Is there anything I can do? Do you
                        need anything?
 
                                  LYNN
                        No. No.
 
                                  TUCK
                        Jesus. Why would anyone do that?
                        Do you want me to come by--
 
                                  LYNN
                        No, it's...listen Tuck.
                               (deep breath)
                        I think we uh, I need some time to
                        deal with all this...alone?
 
              He's disappointed, but hides it in his voice.

                                  TUCK
                        Sure, I understand. I'm here for
                        you, okay?
 
                                  LYNN
                        Thanks.
 
                                  TUCK
                        You watch yourself, huh? Where are
                        you now?
 
                                  LYNN
                        I'm...outside the police station.
 
                                  TUCK
                        Okay. Give me a call if you need
                        anything. Anything at all.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Okay. I'll talk to you soon.
 
                                  TUCK
                        Okay. Bye.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Bye.
 
              COME AROUND TUCK
 
              to see he's been standing in front of the gallery looking at
              Lynn's car. He knows she's lying. His expression is hard to
              read.
 
                                                       DISSOLVE TO:
 
              EXT. BASEMENT - LATER
 
              White cement steps lead down to the basement door. Bert,
              doing his best to be covert, creeps to the window looking
              into the basement.
 
              From his vantage through a crack in the curtains, he can see
              THE CLOWN sitting in a chair. The room is very dark, but his
              shape is there.
 
              Bert creeps down the steps and tries the knob. It opens and
              he slips in. INSIDE, he keeps his back to the door.
 
                                  BERT
                               (whispered hiss)
                        What are you doing?
 
              The clown's head turns slowly. He looks back to the answering
              machine on the table, then again to Bert. He stands.

                                  CLOWN
                        Doc-tor?
 
                                  BERT
                        Yes. What are you doing, Doug?
 
              The clown cocks his head at an angle. He talks very slow,
              very stilted.
 
                                  CLOWN
                        My name is Shivers. Shivers the
                        clown.
 
              Bert's edgy and uncomfortable. The darkness is pervasive, and
              oh yeah, there's a homicidal clown twenty feet away.
 
                                  BERT
                        All right. Shivers. What are you
                        doing?
 
                                  CLOWN
                        What you told me. Getting better.
 
                                  BERT
                               (confused)
                        What? No. What you did--Amanda had
                        nothing to do with getting better.
 
                                  CLOWN
                        A-man-da?
 
                                  BERT
                        Yes. The girl you killed. This,
                        what you're doing, I thought we'd
                        talked about it. You've got to
                        stop this. You should come back
                        and start therapy with me again.
 
                                  CLOWN
                        You're...confusing me.
 
              He takes a step up toward Bert, who instantly recoils.
 
                                  BERT
                        Wait. Just...just wait until you
                        hear from me. I'll call you. I'll
                        help you.
 
                                  CLOWN
                        Help me get better?
 
                                  BERT
                        Yes. Just wait for me. Okay?

              The clown's breathing heavily.
 
                                  CLOWN
                        Yes.
 
              Bert doesn't take his eyes off the clown as he opens the door
              and backs out. The clown watches him go, then sits back down.
 
              The phone begins RINGING.
 
              AT BERT'S CAR
 
              Bert rushes to his car, jumps in and locks the door. He
              fumbles with his cel phone and dials from his phone book.
              BUSY.
 
                                  BERT
                        Damnit!
                               (redials, it's
                                ringing)
                        What the hell do you think you're
                        doing? I thought we agreed using
                        Doug was a bad idea.
                               (beat)
                        Why? Because he's nuts! Yes,
                        that's my professional opinion!
                               (beat)
                        Come on Shane. This, this isn't
                        going to work. I've got--look,
                        this could come back and bite me
                        on the ass. Can you come by my
                        house tonight? Okay.
 
              He hangs up, starts the car and drives off.
 
                                                       DISSOLVE TO:
 
              INT. HOUSE - EVENING
 
              Lynn's got her easel set up in front of her while she
              sketches. There are a number of sketches already set out on
              the floor, but she's not happy with them.
 
              She's got the newspaper clipping of Mr. Parrish's father in
              front of her, referencing it.
 
              EXT. HOUSE
 
              Officer Patrick's sitting on the front bench reading Stephen
              King's IT. He looks up as a car passes, watches it drive by,
              then goes back to his book.
 
              HESTON'S POV

              He's parked five houses down across the street. A canvas bag
              is on the seat next to him.
 
              INT. TUCK'S HOUSE
 
              Tuck enters, tossing his keys onto a table in the foyer. He
              heads into the living room, picks up the remote from the
              table and turns to drop back into the couch--
 
              --and he sees the Art Gallery sitting on top of the pile of
              magazines. He goes to it, picks it up, confused. Definitely
              not where he left it.
 
              He flips it open to the marker and Lynn's face stares out at
              him. Then the next magazine below it with another page-marked
              at Lynn.
 
              He puts two and two together immediately. Mentally curses
              himself. He grabs the phone and dials Lynn's number.
 
              INT. LYNN'S HOUSE
 
              Lynn paints. Pages of sketches are strewn about her. All
              forgotten. Her mind is now on one thing, the painting in
              front of her.
 
              The PHONE RINGS but Lynn pays no attention. She's so focused
              that she probably doesn't even hear it.
 
              She's immersed in the work. Paying no attention to anything
              around her. In the zone.
 
              EXT. HOUSE
 
              Officer Patrick zips up as he walks around from the backyard
              where he was apparently taking a piss. A van pulls up in
              front of the house with PARTY-PLUS on the side.
 
              A HAPPY CLOWN gets out and walks up the sidewalk.
 
              IN HESTON'S CAR
 
              Heston leans forward, very interested in what's going on. He
              wasn't expecting this, but maybe there'll be an opening...
 
              PATRICK
 
              can't believe it--a clown walking up the sidewalk--he fumbles
              out his gun and points it at the clown, who doesn't notice it
              because he's reading from a clipboard.
 
                                  OFFICER PATRICK
                        Stop right there!

              The clown's startled, just about drops his clipboard.
 
                                  HAPPY CLOWN
                        WOAH! What the hell?
 
                                  OFFICER PATRICK
                        Get over here, get on the ground!
 
                                  HAPPY CLOWN
                        All right, okay--
 
                                  OFFICER PATRICK
                        NOW!
 
              The clown lays down on the ground. Officer Patrick gets on
              top and handcuffs him.
 
                                  HAPPY CLOWN
                        I didn't do nothin', I was called
                        out here.
 
                                  OFFICER PATRICK
                        Sure you were. You got ID on you?
 
                                  HAPPY CLOWN
                        Inside the suit. You gotta zip
                        down the zipper, in my back pocket
                        there.
 
              From around the back of the house creeps SHIVERS THE CLOWN.
              He grips the strings from a dozen floating helium balloons.
              He sees the cop working to get the other clown's ID.
 
              He walks out more confidently, coming up behind the two. The
              cop's got the happy clown's ID out and is looking at it.
 
              Shivers shifts hands, releasing the balloons to reveal that
              he's been holding his axe, hidden by the balloons the whole
              time.
 
              INT. TUCK'S HOUSE
 
              Through the foyer window, Tuck can be seen starting his
              motorcycle and PEELING off.
 
              EXT. LYNN'S HOUSE
 
              The happy clown, looking over his shoulder back at the cop is
              the first to see Shivers. A giant axe in his hands.
 
                                  HAPPY CLOWN
                        Hey...

              Patrick turns just in time to see the descending axe blade.
              It takes him in the back of the neck, almost decapitating
              him. His body falls onto the happy clown who starts
              hyperventilating.
 
              Shivers spares him a look, then starts to turn toward the
              front door. As if he has some sixth sense though, his gaze is
              caught on Heston's car.
 
              HESTON
 
              has his mouth wide open. He's trying to sit very still.
 
                                  HESTON
                        Holy shit...
 
              The clown seems disturbed. From this distance it's hard to
              tell if he can see Heston, but he seems to be staring right
              at him.
 
              Shivers turns suddenly, stalking back the way he came.
 
              The happy clown has his eyes closed, must be going into shock
              or something. Hyperventilating still.
 
              Heston's surprised by the sudden turn and takes a look up and
              down the street. Doesn't see any witnesses. He reaches into
              his canvas bag and grabs out a cheap rubber clown mask, pulls
              it over his head.
 
              He quickly pulls his car in front of Lynn's house. He gets
              out of the car--one hand inside his jacket conceals the gun
              from earlier--and hurries up the front walk.
 
              Past the dead cop and the pinned clown. He runs smack into
              the front door which surprises him by being locked. He SLAMS
              his shoulder into it.
 
              INSIDE
 
              Lynn's startled from her work by the BANG against her front
              door. She puts the brush down as there's another BANG.
 
              She bolts to her feet just as the third SLAM shatters the
              lock and blows the door open. Heston moves in fast, kicking
              the door shut behind him, and stops to listen.
 
              From Lynn's POV, she saw the clown-masked intruder move past
              the room she's in. She's terrified, but stifles her scream.
              The man is not in her sight now.
 
              She looks around for a weapon, anything, but there's nothing,
              no help at all.

              Heston doesn't wait long. Not hearing anything, he assumes
              she's upstairs asleep. He quickly creeps up the stairs toward
              her bedroom.
 
              Lynn didn't hear him go up the carpeted steps. Quietly she
              creeps to the edge of the wall, peers around the corner. He's
              not in sight.
 
              Did he go to the kitchen or up the stairs? She eyes the door.
              Ten feet away and closed.
 
              She creeps out quietly, reaching for doorknob, keeping her
              eyes darting back and forth between the upstairs and the
              kitchen.
 
              Her hand's on the knob when Heston comes out from the
              bedroom. His eyes widen inside the mask as he sees her at the
              door.
 
              He FIRES without aiming.
 
              The bullet splinters a chunk out of the door but misses its
              mark. Lynn SCREAMS and runs toward the back of the house,
              toward the glass door.
 
              EXT. LYNN'S HOUSE
 
              Tuck pulls up on his motorcycle and gets off. He sees the
              dead cop, the clown pinned underneath him, and leaps off his
              motorcycle.
 
              As he runs to the house there's a GUNSHOT.
 
              INT. LYNN'S HOUSE
 
              Heston FIRES AGAIN and rushes down the stairs after her.
 
              Lynn runs into the sliding glass door, pulls it, but it's
              locked, she fiddles with the lock--both ways, still won't
              budge--she sees the stick wedged to keep it shut, grabs it--
 
                                  HESTON
                        HEY!
 
              She turns, holding the stick in front of her like a sword.
              She's terrified.
 
              Heston's there, made all the more menacing by his clown mask.
 
                                  HESTON
                        Nothin' personal, lady. Just
                        delivering a message from your
                        husband. He says goodbye.

              He raises the gun level to her head.
 
              TUCK dives into Heston's back, bearing him to the ground.
              Heston drops the gun to keep from slamming headfirst into the
              carpet.
 
              Tuck struggles to keep control, keep Heston down, but
              Heston's trying to get up, get some leverage. They're
              grappling for control, rolling and sliding across the floor
              like a couple of high-school wrestlers.
 
              Neither one sees Lynn pick up the gun.
 
              INT. BERT'S HOUSE/BEDROOM
 
              In the background RUNNING WATER can be heard. Bert pulls off
              his shirt, then massages his trapezius like his neck is
              bothering him.
 
              He looks up at the KNOCK on his front door.
 
              He leaves his bedroom and heads for the front door. He looks
              through the peephole, sees no one, then opens the door.
 
              There's no one there. There is a van with tinted windows in
              front of his next door neighbor's house. He looks at it, but
              it doesn't register.
 
              He goes back inside and shuts the door, rubbing at his aching
              neck some more.
 
              IN HIS BATHROOM
 
              He steps into the steaming hot water, lies back. It's a
              little cramped, but he doesn't seem to mind. He takes a
              second to let the heat soak into his muscles.
 
              Then he reaches over the side of the bathtub and grabs his
              book. We can see that he left the bathroom door cracked open
              slightly.
 
              He relaxes, getting into the book. There's a CREAK from right
              outside the bathroom door. Bert lowers the book and looks
              toward it.
 
              It must be his imagination, but the door looks like it's open
              a little farther. He goes back to reading. Turns the page.
 
              There's another creak, but this time there's something
              different. Without lowering the book, Bert can feel it.
 
              There's a pregnant moment where he looks like he's not going
              to lower the book and look. But he finally does.

              The clown stands in the bathroom doorway, the axe in hand.
              Bert looks like he's just run into a bear and doesn't know
              whether to run or play dead.
 
                                  BERT
                        Now, hold on a minute--
 
              The clown rushes him, jabbing the axe point viciously into
              Bert as he tries to get up.
 
              Blood mixes into the water as the clown continues to stab,
              stab, stab.
 
              INT. LYNN'S HOUSE
 
              Heston jabs an elbow at Tuck's head. Tuck turns his head but
              still takes it in the cheek hard. It's enough to let him slip
              out of Tuck's grasp. He turns to run--
 
              --Lynn, a distant look in her eye, stands there pointing the
              gun at him.
 
              Tuck stands up.
 
                                  HESTON
                        Lady...you don't know how to use
                        that.
 
              Famous last words. Lynn pulls the trigger. Glass shatters
              behind Heston. He turns to look and sees a ruined picture
              featuring a bullet hole.
 
              He turns back to her and smiles but the smile dies as he
              feels something on his chest. Blood is soaking his T-shirt.
 
              Heston has enough time to realize he's in a direct line
              between the picture and the gun, then the life fades from his
              eyes. He collapses sideways.
 
              Tuck is shocked. Lynn can't seem to get her eyes off of
              Heston's body.
 
                                  TUCK
                        Lynn. Give me the gun.
 
              She turns her eyes from the dying man to Tuck. Their strange
              lack of depth gives Tuck cause for concern.
 
                                  TUCK
                               (reassuring)
                        Lynn.

              He holds his hand out. After a moment, she hands him the gun.
 
                                                       DISSOLVE TO:
 
              EXT. LYNN'S HOUSE - LATER
 
              Police cars are clustered in front of the house. Lynn and
              Tuck stand off to the side trying to stay out of the way.
              There's an uncomfortable distance between them that Tuck's
              trying to figure a way into.
 
                                  TUCK
                        Hey...listen, I wanted to explain
                        about the magazines.
 
              He hopes she'll say forget about it, but she doesn't. He goes
              on.
 
                                  TUCK
                        I've been a big art fan for years,
                        all kinds, and I first saw your
                        art in those mags. When I heard
                        about the showing downtown, I
                        thought it would be neat to see
                        some of your paintings up close.
 
                                  LYNN
                        You said you saw my picture in the
                        program.
 
                                  TUCK
                        I did. That's just not the only
                        place I saw your picture. I didn't
                        want you to flip out and think I
                        was a stalker, which...is probably
                        what you're thinking right about
                        now.
 
              Lynn's noncommittal. Detective Peters comes out of the house
              and heads over to them. He pulls Lynn away from Tuck so he
              can talk to her privately.
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        Well. Helluva shot, Miss Blodgett.
                        He's pretty dead.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Good.
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        Remorse. I like that. It seems
                        your husband paid that guy to kill
                        you.

                                  LYNN
                        For a detective, you have the
                        shittiest people skills I've ever
                        seen.
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        Thanks, I've taken classes.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Why would Bert do that? He's
                        divorcing me, he's taking
                        everything--
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        I'll make a wild guess and say
                        he's got a sizeable life insurance
                        policy out on you.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Oh. Oh my God...
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        Yeah. We found a tape recorder in
                        Mr. Hitman's car. He'd taped a few
                        conversations with your husband,
                        conversations where your husband
                        hired him to kill you.
 
                                  LYNN
                        No...
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        Yep. Plain old greed. I guess
                        getting the hitman to dress up as
                        a clown must have been him being
                        creative. Hell, it's as good a
                        disguise as any.
 
                                  LYNN
                        But he wasn't the clown I saw--
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        He probably changed outfits.
 
                                  LYNN
                        I don't think so.
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        Are you positive?
 
              She thinks. That night on the porch, it happened to so fast,
              it was dark and she fainted...she just can't be sure.

                                  LYNN
                        He had makeup on when I saw him.
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        Probably figured out a mask was
                        much less work. Easier to take off.
 
              He's got his mind made up and he's starting to convince her.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Why didn't he kill me that night
                        then? After I fainted?
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        Maybe he got scared off by your
                        friend on the phone. We'll never
                        know for sure.
                               (waves it off)
                        You just take it easy. We're
                        looking for your husband now.
 
                                  LYNN
                        You don't know where he is?
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        We think he's on the run. No sign
                        of him at his house. Don't worry
                        about it, we'll get him soon.
                        Whatever you were asking for in
                        this divorce thing...ask for more.
                        You'll get it.
 
              She nods, realizing the implications for her and Nicholas. No
              way will they give custody to Bert now.
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        If you have any other questions,
                        give me a call.
                               (hands her a card)
                        My home numbers's on the back.
                        Night or day, doesn't matter.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Okay. Thanks.
 
              He smiles reassuringly and leaves. Tuck comes over.
 
                                  TUCK
                        I heard. I think you should try
                        and get some sleep.
 
              Lynn nods, but looks doubtful.

                                  TUCK
                        Can I give you a call tomorrow?
                        When everything's more normal
                        again?
 
              She thinks it over, decides she wants him to.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Okay. I guess I could give you a
                        second chance, seeing that you
                        saved my life and all.
 
                                  TUCK
                               (his smile's back)
                        Great.
 
              He gives her a quick hug, gets on his cycle, and rides off.
              Lynn turns back toward her house and watches the cops,
              waiting for them to finish their work.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              INT. LYNN'S HOUSE
 
              Lynn's in bed again, tossing and turning.
 
              IN HER DREAM
 
              A sterile, white hall, infinitely long. People move in and
              out of our sight, all blurry, out of focus. As they clear out
              we see a YOUNG BOY sitting on a bench.
 
              He looks at us sadly.
 
                                  YOUNG BOY
                        Dead. They're all dead.
 
              He stands up and points a finger at us accusingly.
 
                                  YOUNG BOY
                        They're all dead!
 
              THE CLOWN's face pops into view staring right at us, smiling
              like a demon.
 
              LYNN
 
              sits up in bed, her heart racing. Looks around, starting to
              get her bearings.
 
              She sees a clown doll sitting on her dresser that wasn't
              there before. Who could have put that there...?

              All at once, it begins to turn its head, its eyes glaring a
              malevolent red--
 
              LYNN
 
              sits up in bed for real this time, looking immediately to her
              dresser. No clown doll there.
 
              She looks out the window; the sun is coming up on a new day.

              INT. GALLERY - DAY
 
              Lynn, Phillip and Mr. Parrish are staring at a painting that
              is propped on an easel in the middle of the room. Mr. Parrish
              stares in wonder.
 
                                  MR. PARRISH
                        It's amazing. Simply amazing.
 
              We see the painting. It's the one Lynn was working on of Mr.
              Parrish's father, and it captures the look he wanted, to
              perfection. Tears appear in his eyes.
 
                                  MR. PARRISH
                        It's even better than I could have
                        imagined. I can't thank you enough.
                               (to Phillip)
                        Please. Wrap it up.
 
              Phillip takes the painting off to wrap it. Mr. Parrish pulls
              his checkbook out and begins writing. He finishes, signing
              his name with a flourish.
 
                                  MR. PARRISH
                        What was the final price agreed
                        upon?
 
                                  LYNN
                        Twenty thousand.
 
              Mr. Parrish nods, he knew. He hands her the check. She takes
              it without looking at it.
 
                                  MR. PARRISH
                        I'll spread the word about your
                        talent, Miss Blodgett. You have
                        quite a future before you.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Thank you.

              Mr. Parrish walks to the front door to where Phillip is
              waiting with his painting.
 
                                  MR. PARRISH
                        Good day.
 
              He takes his painting and leaves.
 
                                  PHILLIP
                        Wow. Home run, Lynn.
 
              She smiles, looking at the check.
 
                                  LYNN
                        I can sure put this to--
                               (frowns, then blinks)
                        Oh my God.
 
                                  PHILLIP
                        What?
 
                                  LYNN
                        This check is made out for a
                        hundred thousand dollars. He gave
                        me a hundred grand.
 
              The PHONE RINGS. Phillip gets it.
 
                                  PHILLIP
                        Hello? Mr. Flynn?
 
              He shoots a questioning look to Lynn. She nods and reaches
              for the phone.
 
                                  PHILLIP
                        Hold on please.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Hello? Pretty good actually. A
                        hundred thousand dollars good.
                               (beat)
                        I'll tell you later.
                               (laughs)
                        Thanks. Uh...well, convince me.

              INT. PHILLIP'S - NIGHT
 
              Phillip is busy in the kitchen making what looks to be an
              elaborate meal. He checks in one of his cabinets for noodles--
              none there.

              He begins to go downstairs to get some but something in his
              backyard catches his eye. There's someone out there standing
              in the shadow of a tree.
 
              Phillip frowns. From his vantage it's hard to see anything.
 
              He goes back the way he came, through his hall, into his
              bedroom. Looks out the back window.
 
              He's got a slightly better view, but it's still not great.
              The person almost looks like...a clown. Phillip draws back
              away from the window, frowning.
 
              He walks back into the hall and turns into the guest room on
              the corner of his house. One window faces the backyard while
              another next to it faces the side of his house. He looks out
              the backyard window.
 
              Has to blink once. The clown is gone. Unless...Phillip tries
              to peer around to see if the clown is behind the tree, but it
              doesn't look like it.
 
              Phillip leans back again and doesn't see the clown staring in
              the side window at him.
 
              He turns to leave as the clown raises the axe, swings it at
              the window. On the axe crashing through glass:

              INT. MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT
 
              Tuck escorts Lynn into the theater. It's huge, covered wall
              to wall in advertisements for movies.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Nice theater.
 
                                  TUCK
                        Only the best for you.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Will we be able to get popcorn?
 
                                  TUCK
                        With butter. And a Coke.
 
              He winks like, I got the hook-up.
 
              JEFF appears at the top of the stairs leading to the second
              level.

                                  JEFF
                        Hey Tuck! I'm about ready. You're
                        gonna be in theater eight.
 
                                  TUCK
                        Great. Thanks. We're gonna grab
                        some concessions.
 
                                  JEFF
                        I can send Bobby down to do that.
 
                                  TUCK
                        No, that's cool. I know where
                        everything is.
 
                                  JEFF
                        Help yourself.
 
              He jogs back to the projection booth, punching the code to
              get through the door.
 
              Tuck motions Lynn to follow him behind the concession booth.
 
              INT. STAIRWELL
 
              A thin set of concrete steps runs down to a steel door, all
              bathed dimly yellow by the auxillery lights.
 
              The clown makes his way slowly up the steps. The giant axe in
              one hand. A canvas bag in his other hand, THUMP THUMPING with
              every step.
 
              Something short and thin is inside the bag, and it's not
              moving. Something that looks like a small body...
 
              INT. MOVIE THEATER/CONCESSION
 
              A bucket of popcorn sits on the counter next to the soda
              fountain. Tuck is filling two cups at the same time.
 
                                  LYNN
                        You're like an expert. If I didn't
                        know better, I'd swear you've done
                        that before.
 
                                  TUCK
                        Burger King when I was in high
                        school. It's a lost art.
 
                                  LYNN
                        You know, I worked at a theater
                        when I was in high school. Didn't
                        last two months.

                                  TUCK
                        They don't know what they lost.
 
              He lets off of the taps at the same time. Both sodas are
              identically filled. He waits until the foam goes away and
              finishes filling them.
 
              He pops a top on them and hands her one.
 
                                  TUCK
                        Ready?
 
                                  LYNN
                               (suddenly occurs to
                                her)
                        What are we seeing?
 
                                  TUCK
                        I was thinking some scary horror
                        movie where you'd have to snuggle
                        close to me, but given the past
                        couple of days...
                               (shrugs)
                        I opted for a sappy love movie
                        instead.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Good choice.
 
              They head toward the auditorium.
 
              INT. PROJECTION ROOM
 
              Jeff is carrying the reel of film--it's the entire movie
              rolled together, and it's so big he can't even see around it.
              He slides it onto a platter and threads it through the
              projector.
 
              BOBBY, a pimply teen, pops out of the bathroom and shouts
              down.
 
                                  BOBBY
                        I'm gonna go make sure the doors
                        are all locked up.
 
                                  JEFF
                        Okay!
 
              Bobby disappears out the door as Jeff finishes threading the
              film.
 
              As he stands up, movement at the far end of the projection
              booth catches his eye.

              He squints. It's hard to tell. Small pools of light at each
              projector are the only illumination. Most of the room is in
              darkness.
 
              Still...something's off. The shape isn't right at the far end.
 
              Jeff makes his way slowly toward the end.
 
              He's twenty feet away from the spot when the clown steps out
              of the shadow. The only thing in his hand is the axe, but
              it's shadowed in the darkness behind a film platter.
 
                                  JEFF
                               (jumps)
                        Hey!
                               (relieved for a
                                moment)
                        Scared the shit out of me.
 
              Then he realizes--it's late at night and there's a clown in
              his projection booth. It dawns on him: Someone's playing a
              joke.
 
                                  JEFF
                        Did Bobby put you up to this?
 
              The clown takes a step toward him.
 
                                  CLOWN
                        She'll pay.
 
                                  JEFF
                        This ain't cool, man. You can't be
                        up here. This is--
 
              The clown takes another step, splashing a shaft of light onto
              the axe blade.
 
                                  JEFF
                        Woah.
                               (steps back)
                        I'll get Bobby for you.
 
              He takes another step. The clown raises the axe. Jeff turns
              to run, panic growing on his face.
 
              The clown hurls the axe. It spins twice and smacks solidly
              into the back of Jeff's head. He drops.
 
              The clown moves to him and grasps the haft of his axe. He
              tugs at it, pulling Jeff's head from the ground, but the axe
              doesn't come out.

              He has to put one foot on Jeff's head, and with a vicious
              yank, rips it free. He doesn't bother wiping it off as he
              moves toward the door.
 
              The clown moves to the small window that looks down into the
              theater. He can see Tuck and Lynn seated in the middle of the
              auditorium.
 
              INT. AUDITORIUM
 
              Tuck picks that moment to look back. From his vantage point,
              the shape is too dark behind the window for him to recognize.
              Thinking it's Jeff, he waves.
 
              The clown backs away from the window.
 
                                  TUCK
                        I think he's getting ready to
                        start it.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Good. This is a little past my
                        bedtime.
 
                                  TUCK
                        I'm glad you came out. I wasn't
                        sure you would, you know, given...
 
                                  LYNN
                               (nods)
                        Might be good for me to see a
                        movie, forget it all for a couple
                        of hours.
 
                                  TUCK
                               (nods)
                        That's the right attitude. Who's
                        got Nicholas?
 
                                  LYNN
                        Julie. She's been dying to take
                        him for a while anyway.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              INT. JULIE'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
 
              The kitchen's a wreck. The table is flipped on its side, and
              papers and a bowl of fruit are scattered on the floor.
 
              MOVING

              to the phone jack, a wire plugged into it. FOLLOWING the cord
              we see the cradle of the phone, and a spiral-cord trailing
              off...
 
              ...to the phone. A hand clutches it limply. We follow the
              hand past the bracelet up the arm to where it ends at the
              shoulder. The arm is no longer attached to a body, but cut
              cleanly at the top.
 
              MOVING
 
              across the floor now marred with puddles of blood to where
              Julie lies butchered. Her face, other than spatters of blood,
              is untouched, but her body is in pieces.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              INT. MOVIE THEATER - CONTINUOUS
 
              Bobby's testing the doors to make sure they're all locked and
              won't open without a key, even from the inside.
 
              That taken care of, he hops the concession counter and turns
              off the frozen drink machines. He heads through the back and
              comes out at the rear concession entrance.
 
              He takes a step toward the stairs, but stops and makes a
              sudden decision to head into the bathroom.
 
              WHISTLING no particular tune, he enters a stall and unzips,
              not bothering to shut the door.
 
              The clown's boots on the tile floor don't make enough noise
              to alert Bobby.
 
              Bobby's done pissing and shakes.
 
              The clown stands right behind him outside of the stall.
 
              Bobby tucks himself back in his pants and is about to turn
              when the clown RAMS the axe point through his back, throwing
              the helpless teen against the wall in front of him. Something
              major's been hit; blood is running out of his chest like a
              river.
 
              His strength leaving, Bobby falls to one knee over the
              toilet. The clown JERKS the axe out of him, and without the
              support, Bobby collapses completely.
 
              The clown turns. Listens.
 
              INT. AUDITORIUM
 
              Tuck and Lynn are getting a little antsy.

                                  TUCK
                        If this takes much longer, I'm
                        gonna demand my money back.
 
              She smiles.
 
                                  LYNN
                        What do you think the hold up is?
 
              Tuck shrugs that he doesn't know.
 
              A HOLLOW SOUND, muffled, seems to come from the entrance to
              the auditorium.
 
                                  TUCK
                        What's he doing now?
 
              The clown walks slowly into the auditorium. He's completely
              out of sight of Lynn and Tuck; until he rounds about the
              third row of seats, he'll be out of sight behind the concrete
              wall that supports the stadium seating.
 
                                  TUCK
                               (joking)
                        I'm gonna have to speak to a
                        manager if you don't start the
                        movie, Jeff!
 
              No expression from the clown.
 
              Tuck is looking at Lynn when the clown rounds the first row
              of seats. She's looking right at the clown, and the look on
              her face is enough to wipe the smile off of his.
 
              The question forms on his face, but he turns to look, and
              sees.
 
              The clown has stopped at the foot of the first stair. He
              holds the bloody axe in both hands.
 
                                  LYNN
                        No...
 
                                  CLOWN
                        You're gonna pay.
 
              Tuck stands, pulling a terrified Lynn to her feet. Tuck grabs
              his soda, but keeps an eye on the clown.
 
              The clown mounts the stairway, one at a time. No hurry.
 
              Tuck pushes Lynn behind him, backing her down the aisle away
              from the clown. By the time the clown is on the same aisle
              level as they are, he's at one end and they're at the other.

              The clown considers this. He takes a step forward. Tuck
              pushes Lynn down a step. The clown backs up. Tuck doesn't
              move.
 
                                  TUCK
                        Move slowly down the stairs.
 
              Lynn, almost dazed, does. Instead of following, Tuck moves up
              a stair. The clown doesn't even look at him. Focused entirely
              on Lynn, watching her like a cat about to pounce.
 
                                  TUCK
                        Hey!
 
              Tuck doesn't even exist to the clown.
 
                                  TUCK
                               (to Lynn)
                        Wait.
 
              She stops. The moment hangs, all three staring at one
              another. Lynn and the clown as if in a trance, Tuck's mind
              racing with indecision.
 
                                  TUCK
                        RUN!
 
              He throws his soda at the clown and runs down the stairs
              toward Lynn. The soda's a great throw. It gets the clown's
              attention, something coming at him from his peripheral
              vision. He bats it away with his axe, then crosses through
              the aisle in pursuit of the fleeing couple.
 
              Lynn and Tuck burst out the auditorium door. Tuck, thinking
              quickly, overturns the large trash can in front to block the
              door.
 
                                  TUCK
                        Come on!
 
              He grabs her hand and pulls her toward the front doors. They
              smack into them and can't understand why they don't open.
              They're just push-lever doors, but they don't realize Bobby
              has locked them with a key.
 
              THE CLOWN
 
              has run into the auditorium door, which is jammed shut by the
              trash can. He kicks at the door.
 
              TUCK
 
              runs to the single door to the side of the main entrances and
              tries to open it. No joy there either.

                                  LYNN
                        Break them!
 
                                  TUCK
                        With what? It's reinforced safety
                        glass.
 
              Tuck hears the sound of the DOOR hitting the TRASHCAN as the
              clown kicks it.
 
                                  TUCK
                        Come on!
 
              He grabs her hand and heads down the side corridor leading
              back toward the theaters.
 
              THE CLOWN
 
              has kicked the door enough that the trash can no longer jams
              it. He slides out and strides toward the front.
 
              Tuck and Lynn emerge through the corridor door, right back in
              front of the auditorium entrances. Tuck cautiously goes right
              back to the theater they came from.
 
              He opens the door as wide as he can without hitting the trash
              can, lets Lynn slide in, and he follows.
 
              THE CLOWN
 
              stands in the lobby where Tuck and Lynn were moments before.
              He's listening, but there's no sound.
 
              His gaze travels from the glass doors to the concession
              stand. Considering. Back to the doors.
 
              A table next to the concession stand has paper and pens for
              entering a contest. The clown goes to it, propping his bloody
              axe on top while he grabs a sheet of paper and a pen.
 
              He begins writing.
 
              INT. DETECTIVE PETERS' HOUSE - SAME TIME
 
              Peters is in shorts, T-shirt and socks. He's putting together
              a puzzle at his kitchen table. It looks to be about 10,000
              pieces, but he's doing pretty good.
 
                                  COMPUTER (O.S.)
                        Thrill me!
 
              Peters puts down the puzzle piece he's holding and goes to
              his computer. He clicks a couple of buttons and his email
              pops up, displaying the message "NEW EMAIL".

              It reads "BLOOD SAMPLE #4990345 DIC: PETERS". The second line
              reads "DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE KNOWN SEX OFFENDER DOUG
              RICHARDSON".
 
              Peters is getting interested now. He reads on and something
              catches his eye.
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        Oh shit...
 
              Under WHEREABOUTS next to a list of dates it says "COMMITED:
              ROUNDSVILLE MENTAL INSTITUTION, DOCTOR: BERT TOKYO".
 
              Peters grabs his cel phone and dials a number.
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        Vic, it's Peters. Yeah, I'm up
                        late. Look, we got a problem. That
                        blood sample from the girl's
                        fingertips--came back a match to
                        a DOJ sex offender named Doug
                        Richardson.
 
              Something from the other end.
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        Yeah, not Heston and get this:
                        He's got Leber's congenital
                        amaurosis. No I didn't make that
                        up. It's a rare disease, normally
                        causes blindness, but in some
                        cases it can cause the sclera of
                        the eye to turn black. And to top
                        it off, this guy was a psych case
                        over at Roundsville and you'll
                        never guess who his doctor was.
                               (smiles as Vic
                                guesses)
                        Right. I think he had two people
                        trying to kill her. Send some
                        uniforms over to her house, have
                        them wake her up and secure it.
                        Call me when that's done.
 
              Vic says something on his end.
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        Right. Hey, see if we can get some
                        pics of this guy. Yeah.
 
              He hangs up, but looks worried.
 
              IN THE AUDITORIUM

              Tuck rushes Lynn up the stairs to the door at the top. He
              peers through the small window--coast looks clear--then leads
              the way through.
 
              They're on the second floor, a small level overlooking the
              front lobby. A stairway leads down the front.
 
              Tuck moves to the projection-room door and pulls on it. It's
              locked; a numeric keypad is set into the wall.
 
                                  LYNN
                               (whisper)
                        Knock on it.
 
                                  TUCK
                        Too loud. He's got his radio on in
                        there anyway.
 
              Tuck tries a combination, pulls gently. Still locked. He
              tries another, pulls again. Locked.
 
              Lynn takes a look at the keypad. Five numbers.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Are you kidding? There's a hundred
                        and twenty combinations.
 
                                  TUCK
                        You have another idea?
 
              He keeps trying.
 
              DOWNSTAIRS
 
              The clown stands in the center of the lobby. Whatever he did
              with the paper, there's no sign of it now.
 
              He's listening. The sound of Tuck trying combinations can
              barely be heard, and from the lobby it's hard to know where
              it's coming from.
 
              The clown hefts his axe and walks back toward the
              auditoriums, passing the stairwell to the second floor. He
              suddenly stops though, realizing the sound is coming from
              above him.
 
              He backtracks and begins climbing the stairs.
 
              ABOVE
 
              Lynn has moved to the top of the stairs and is peering down
              them. Suddenly, the top of the clown's head comes into her
              sightline, but because of the angle, he doesn't see her.

              She rushes back to Tuck.
 
                                  LYNN
                               (harsh whisper)
                        He's coming!
 
              Tuck's still trying combos. Nothing's working.
 
                                  TUCK
                        If he gets to the top, run back
                        into the theater.
 
              He keeps going.
 
              THE CLOWN
 
              is halfway up the stairs. He can definitely hear them now.
              The paint smile on his face seems to widen. His stride,
              however, doesn't quicken.
 
              AT THE TOP
 
              Lynn's petrified, watching the stairs with her back against
              the wall. Anticipating the appearance of her deepest fear
              brought to life.
 
              And appear he does. Slowly, inevitably, his head appears,
              then his axe. Step by step he's almost to the top.
 
                                  LYNN
                        He's here...
 
              Tuck looks quickly, goes back to the codes. As the clown gets
              to the top step, the door surprises all three of them by
              opening to Tuck's pull.
 
              They dart in to the projection room as the clown rushes at
              them. Tuck pulls the door shut just in time as the clown
              slams into it.
 
              The clown pulls on the door, but it's locked again.
 
              INT. PROJECTION ROOM
 
              Lynn and Tuck take a breather. Safe for the moment.
 
                                  TUCK
                        Jeff!
 
              There's no one in sight.

                                  TUCK
                        He may be on the second level.
                               (points to the phone)
                        Call the police. I'll go find
                        him.
 
              She goes to the phone and picks it up. For a moment you can
              see that she thinks it's going to be dead, but it's not. Like
              a prayer answered, she's got a dial tone.
 
              She hits 911.
 
              INT. DETECTIVE PETERS' HOUSE - SAME TIME
 
              Peters is dressed now and heading for the door. He forgets
              his keys, goes back for them on the counter, and his radio
              CRACKLES to life, scaring the crap out of him.
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        Peters.
 
                                  COP (RADIO)
                        She's not at the house. It's empty.
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        No sign of a break in?
 
                                  COP (RADIO)
                        Nope. However, dispatch just got
                        a 911 from a woman who says she's,
                        uh, being chased by a killer
                        clown. At the Columbia Golden Arts
                        theater.
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        They have units on the way?
 
                                  COP (RADIO)
                        Yeah.
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        Tell the supervising seargent I'm
                        ten minutes away.
 
              He rushes out the door.
 
              INT. MOVIE THEATER - SAME TIME
 
              Tuck comes down the stairs. Lynn's running his way.
 
                                  TUCK
                        Did you get through?

                                  LYNN
                        Yes. I left the phone off the
                        hook. They say they're on the way.
 
                                  TUCK
                               (nods)
                        Good. Jeff isn't up there.
 
                                  LYNN
                        You don't think he's...
 
                                  TUCK
                        I hope not. Come on, let's see if
                        the back door's open.
 
              He leads her toward the door the clown originally came in. He
              stops suddenly.
 
                                  TUCK
                        Wait here.
 
                                  LYNN
                        What?
 
                                  TUCK
                        He's been here.
 
              He tries to block her view, but she sees anyway. Jeff sits,
              his back against the door. Blood glistens all over him and
              his eyes are wide open, forever staring at nothing.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Is the door open?
 
              Tuck gently moves Jeff's body out of the way, then tries the
              door. Doesn't move. He throws himself against it, but it
              still doesn't budge.
 
              Lynn begins searching through Jeff's pants.
 
                                  TUCK
                        What are you doing?
 
                                  LYNN
                        Looking for keys.
 
              Tuck's surprised by her initiative; you don't see him going
              through the dead guy's pants. She finishes, coming up empty.
 
                                  TUCK
                        Nothing?
 
              She shakes her head, hopeless.

              EXT. MOVIE THEATER
 
              Four patrol cars with flashing lights are parked in front of
              the theater as Detective Peters pulls up in his unmarked.
 
              One OLDER COP hurries over to intercept Peters.
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        Detective Peters, homicide.
                        Where's your sarge?
 
                                  OLDER COP
                        Hasn't shown up yet. All the doors
                        are locked, I got guys on
                        perimeter around the building.
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        Why haven't you gone in? There's
                        a woman trapped in there with--
                        well, a murderer.
 
                                  OLDER COP
                        Can't go in.
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        Why not?
 
              The cop motions him over, they go to the front door. A piece
              of paper is taped on the glass door facing out. Written in
              child-like scrawl are the words "COME IN THEY DIE".
 
              Peters sees it, refrains from cursing.
 
                                  OLDER COP
                        I've called in the tac team.
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        This guy's not taking hostages.
 
              The older cops shrugs. Nothing he can do. Peters knows it too.
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        Dammit.
 
              He stares in through the glass impotently.
 
              INT. MOVIE THEATER
 
              Tuck and Lynn rush back to the phone.
 
                                  TUCK
                        Tell them we're trapped in the
                        projection room.

              Lynn picks up the phone, which she left off the hook. Tuck's
              looking around for a weapon. The best he finds is a broom
              with detachable end. He unscrews it and is left with a five-
              foot pole.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Hello? Hello?
 
              She clicks the hang-up button a couple of times.
 
                                  LYNN
                        The line's dead.
 
              INTERCUT
 
              The junction box where all the phone lines come in and go
              out. They're hanging out of the box like stray hair, having
              been ripped out.
 
              BACK TO SCENE
 
                                  TUCK
                        You have your cel phone?
 
                                  LYNN
                               (shakes her head)
                        It's in my car. You?
 
                                  TUCK
                        Didn't want anyone to get in touch
                        with me tonight. Okay, no problem.
                        We can wait it out here. The cops
                        should be here any minute. We'll
                        just wait.
 
              Lynn moves to a group of doors, if only to keep herself busy.
              The one on the left has a restroom sign on it. The other two
              doors have nothing on them.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Where do these go?
 
              Tuck comes over and shrugs. Then he KICKS one door,
              shattering the lock and throwing it open. He reaches in and
              flicks on the light.
 
                                  TUCK
                               (answering her
                                question)
                        Manager's office.
 
              They check out the room. Lynn confirms the phones don't work
              in this room either. Tuck's interested in a giant monitor
              with buttons on it.

              The monitor shows different parts of the theater; every
              camera in the building is patched into it.
 
              Tuck pushes a button and the view switches to one particular
              camera. He pushes another and it moves to another camera.
 
                                  TUCK
                        Take a look at this.
                               (she does)
                        Security cameras.
 
              Tuck pushes button after button, searching for any sign of
              the clown. He doesn't seem to be on any of the cameras.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Where is he?
 
              Tuck hits the button that shows all sixteen cameras at one
              time. Two of the monitors show the outside parking lot which
              has police cars and officers all around.
 
                                  TUCK
                        Look. The cops are here.
 
              Lynn smiles with relief, but the smile dies as she realizes
              something.
 
                                  LYNN
                        What are they waiting for? Why
                        aren't they coming in?
 
              Tuck sees what she means. The cops seem to be taking up siege
              positions.
 
                                  TUCK
                        Uh...I don't know. Unless they
                        think he's got us hostage...
 
                                  LYNN
                        So we're on our own.
 
              Now that it's been said out loud, it starts to sink in. Tuck
              tries to be optimistic.
 
                                  TUCK
                        Don't worry. We're safe here.
 
              The sound of METAL HITTING PLEXIGLASS makes Lynn jump. It
              happens AGAIN.
 
                                  TUCK
                        Oh shit. He can reach the
                        projection window from the smaller
                        theaters.

                                  LYNN
                        Can he get through?
 
                                  TUCK
                        ...I don't know.
 
              WHACK! Then silence. Lynn and Tuck move out of the room and
              wait in the center of the aisle, staring down past the
              projectors into the darkness. Expecting the clown to appear.
 
              Then WHACK!
 
              After a moment of silence, Tuck leads Lynn slowly toward
              where the sound came from. Bracing for the next slam, but the
              silence drags.
 
              They approach the window looking down into the theater. Very
              slow. Like the clown's face is going to appear suddenly.
 
              It doesn't, but what they see in the theater takes Lynn's
              breath away. Shock. Fear. Hopelessness. It's all reflected in
              her expression.
 
                                  TUCK
                               (sotto voce)
                        Oh shit...
 
              The clown stands in front of the theater screen, his axe
              gripped in his left hand. His right hand rests on the
              shoulder of Nicholas, who stands there in a daze. For some
              reason the boy doesn't seem to be afraid.
 
              The clown sees them in the window. He looks at Nicholas, then
              back to Lynn and Tuck. His look says everything: The boy for
              you.
 
                                  TUCK
                        I'll distract him. You get Nicky
                        out of there.
 
              The shock seems to have focused Lynn.
 
                                  LYNN
                        No. He'll kill you.
 
              Lynn's sudden calmness worries Tuck.
 
                                  TUCK
                        Hey. I'm not gonna let anything
                        happen to either of you.

                                  LYNN
                        I'm okay. I'm okay.
                               (reassuring smile)
                        I'm going out there but I need you
                        to do something for me.
 
                                  TUCK
                               (can't believe it)
                        You're what?
 
                                  LYNN
                        I'm tired...I'm tired of being
                        scared. And I won't let him hurt
                        my son. Now listen to me.
 
              INT. AUDITORIUM
 
              The clown stares at the now-empty window into the projection
              room. Nicky's having a hard time keeping his eyes open.
 
                                  LYNN (O.S.)
                        All right.
 
              The clown turns. Lynn stands at the foot of the theater.
              Defiant and angry, but it's impossible for her to completely
              conceal her fear.
 
                                  LYNN
                        I'm here. Let him go.
 
              The clown turns. Sees her. He smiles, but it's a gruesome,
              sadistic smile made even more hideous by his makeup. He
              releases the boy.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Come here, Nicky.
 
              He does. Lynn kneels down in front of him, keeping her eyes
              on the clown.
 
                                  LYNN
                               (quiet)
                        Nicky, I want you to go outside
                        and wait for me. Understand?
 
              He nods.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Go on.
 
              He walks out, casting one glance back at his mother.
 
              When he's gone, the clown takes a step toward Lynn.

                                  LYNN
                        Wait!
                               (the clown stops)
                        Why are you doing this? What do
                        you want?
 
                                  CLOWN
                        To get...better.
 
              He moves to the aisle. Lynn moves into a row of seats to keep
              as much distance as possible between them.
 
                                  LYNN
                        But why me?
 
                                  CLOWN
                        It was your fault.
 
              One step at a time the clown comes up. Lynn backs up until
              she's at the foot of the other aisle. She backs her way
              farther up the stairs as the clown begins to cross the row.
 
              She's half-way up when he gets to the foot of the aisle
              leading up to her. Gaining ground even though he's not
              rushing.
 
              He puts a foot on the stair. Lynn's not moving. Too petrified
              to move...or waiting?
 
              The clown takes another step, his grip on the axe tightening.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Wait!
 
              The clown stops. Lynn's terrified, trying to hide it.
              Desperate. Hoping this works.
 
              Without turning her own head, she points back toward the
              projection booth.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Look!
 
              Instinctually, the clown does.
 
              A blinding BEAM OF LIGHT streaks out of the projector
              redirected at the clown. It's a broad beam, 30,000 candle-
              watts of power, full in the face.
 
              He YELLS IN PAIN, turning away, but too late. He's blinded,
              maybe permanently. Lynn shields her eyes and slides her way
              across the row of seats.

              Still averting her eyes from the light, she accidentally
              kicks over a soda. The clown hears it, YELLS ANGRILY. He
              climbs the stairs to her level and moves in her direction,
              trying to hone in on the sound. He swings the axe in front of
              him, even though he's not close to her.
 
              The projector light is no longer following him. Lynn's
              frozen, watching as the clown feels his way across the seats.
 
              Coming closer. Lynn moves away, accidentally kicking ice from
              the soda she just knocked down. The ice makes TIC TIC sounds
              as it falls to the next level.
 
              The clown, now knowing he's on the right track, starts to
              move quickly toward her through the row.
 
              Lynn turns and runs. The clown follows, stumbling against the
              seats in his blind chase.
 
              Her shoes now wet, Lynn slips as she tries to cut out of the
              aisle, crashes against the wall. She turns--the clown stands
              above her, his axe raised to deliver the killing blow--
 
                                  TUCK (O.S.)
                        Hey.
 
              The clown turns toward the voice. He can't see it, but Tuck's
              holding a broom handle like a baseball bat.
 
              Tuck swings for the fences. The pole splinters in half as it
              THWACKS into the clown's forehead. He falls back against the
              stairs.
 
              Tuck pulls Lynn to her feet and pushes her ahead of him. He
              turns to look back at the clown.
 
              Amazingly, the clown is already standing, the axe raised over
              his head for a huge swipe at Tuck. Tuck's got nowhere to go.
              In desperation, he lunges at the clown and grasps the axe
              handle as it starts its downward arc.
 
              He manages to stop it, but he has to hold on for dear life.
              The clown is much stronger than he is, and now can feel him.
              The clown releases one hand from the axe and grabs Tuck by
              the throat.
 
              With an iron grip, the clown begins to choke him. Tuck
              desperately grasps out like the clown, his hand grabbing at
              the clown's throat.
 
              He squeezes, but the clown doesn't seem bothered. Just cocks
              his head slightly and continues to choke the life out of Tuck.

              Tuck pushes the axe to the side and SLUGS the clown in the
              face. The clown is stunned for a second. Tuck PUNCHES him
              again. It seems to have the opposite effect, and brings the
              clown out of his daze.
 
              The clown swings the axe with his left hand in a swipe meant
              to cut Tuck in half at the stomach.
 
              Tuck barely catches it again. The clown's getting pissed.
              He's still got a grip on Tuck's neck, and he uses it to throw
              Tuck to the ground.
 
              He takes his wood-chopping grip and raises the axe for a
              massive swing.
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS (O.S.)
                        DROP IT OR YOU'RE DEAD!
 
              The clown turns his head to the new threat. Detective Peters
              and two cops stand at the entry to the auditorium, and every
              one of them has a gun pointed at him.
 
              The clown turns back to Tuck, a hateful sneer on his face. He
              looks like he's gonna chop him anyway. Peters' finger
              tightens on the trigger.
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        DON'T!
 
              The clown looks back to the cops. The tension finally relaxes
              from his grip. He throws the axe to the ground.
 
              Peters motions the cops over to the clown, and doesn't take
              his sights off until he's securely cuffed. He goes over to
              Tuck.
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        Jesus...
 
              He extends a hand to Tuck and helps him up.
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        That is the biggest fucking clown
                        I have ever seen.
 
                                                       DISSOLVE TO:
 
              INT. MOVIE THEATER -LATER
 
              Lynn, hugging Nicky protectively, and Tuck are in the lobby
              of the theater, again strobed by flashing red and blue lights
              from the police cars outside.

              Detective Peters finishes talking to some of the cops and
              joins them, a grim look on his face.
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        How you holding up?
 
                                  LYNN
                        We're okay. What about Julie?
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        She's dead.  I'm sorry.
 
              Tuck tries to comfort Lynn by putting his arm around her. For
              a moment, the three almost look like a family. Peters notices
              this and seems to feel a little awkward, shifts uncomfortably.
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        The paramedics are going to need
                        to take Nicholas to the hospital
                        for a while. Just do a few tests.
                        You can ride in the ambulance if
                        you want.
 
              She nods, shock setting in.
 
                                  TUCK
                        I'll follow you.
 
              They follow Peters outside toward the flashing lights.
 
                                                       DISSOLVE TO:
 
              INT. LYNN'S CAR - NIGHT
 
              Lynn, dead tired, on her way home from the hospital. Nicholas
              is asleep in the passenger seat. There's a BEEP from the back
              seat.
 
              At first Lynn doesn't notice it. It BEEPS again, and she
              remembers her cel phone in the back seat. She grabs it and
              sees she has a message.
 
              She dials her voice mail and listens.
 
                                  VOICE MAIL OPERATOR
                        Today, two thirty-four a.m.
 
                                  PHILLIP (PHONE)
                               (weak, barely audible)
                        Lynn...Lynn...
 
              The line goes dead. Lynn looks at her car clock: 3:32

              Lynn has a terrible thought. What if the clown went to
              Phillip's like he did to Julie's? She dials the phone, gets
              a BUSY signal.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Oh no...Phillip.
 
              She turns down a side street, headed toward Phillip's.
 
              EXT. PHILLIP'S - NIGHT
 
              Not many lights on at Phillip's house. Lynn looks at Nicky,
              still asleep, then back to Phillip's. Nothing looks amiss.
              Phillip could be asleep. Maybe it was nothing...
 
              She locks the car doors and heads up the walkway. At the
              front door she pauses. It's open a crack.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Oh no...
 
              She pushes the door open, dreading what she's about to see,
              while dialing 911 on her cel phone.
 
              INSIDE
 
              The place is trashed. Chairs and tables overturned. Pictures
              ripped from the walls.
 
              Lynn makes herself go in.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Phillip...? Please...
 
              She moves in, completely expecting to find Phillip's body,
              the phone in her hand forgotten. Bracing herself for what
              she's about to find.
 
                                  PHILLIP (O.S.)
                        Lynn?
 
              She can't believe it. She starts to move toward his voice,
              but stops when she sees him. He's standing in the hall, his
              back to her. Something's not right though...
 
                                  PHILLIP
                        I heard it on the police scanner.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Phillip, what...?
 
              Phillip turns, but the face that meets her is nightmarish.

              His face is roughly painted, like he did it himself. He looks
              like the shark-toothed clown from one of her paintings. Lynn
              recoils, confused.
 
              Not really scared. Yet.
 
                                  PHILLIP
                        He didn't kill you. I had my
                        doubts; he wasn't the brightest
                        bulb, was he? I think he actually
                        believed it was his parents that
                        your dad drove off the road.
 
                                  LYNN
                        What...what are you talking about?
 
              Phillip strolls into the kitchen.
 
                                  PHILLIP
                        I'm not one for long explanations.
                        Suffice it to say I've been
                        keeping my eye on you for a long
                        time now. Over twenty years. There
                        was a time I thought I could
                        simply forget what you did...
 
              He pulls a large butcher knife out of the drawer and holds it
              up, inspecting its edge.
 
                                  PHILLIP
                        Of course, that didn't last. And
                        now...now, you're going to move
                        away? You think you can get away
                        from me now?
 
              He's moving slowly around the room. Discretely putting
              himself closer to the door.
 
                                  LYNN
                        I don't understand...what--why are
                        you dressed like that?
 
                                  PHILLIP
                        I see it like it was yesterday. I
                        was twelve. Sitting on the bench
                        in the waiting area. Doctors
                        rushing around...hurt, sick people
                        everywhere. That awful smell...
 
              He's rambling, staring at the blade, mesmerized by his
              reflection maybe, but now he's closer to the front door than
              Lynn is.

                                  PHILLIP
                        And what I keep remembering--it
                        haunts me in my sleep--was those
                        policemen who walked by.
                               (mimics one)
                        "The little girl, she distracted
                        him. Drove right into them."
 
              Then his gaze locks on her. She doesn't know what he's
              talking about.
 
                                  PHILLIP
                        I knew Bert, you know. He treated
                        me for years. That's how I met
                        Doug--the clown. He was so nuts
                        that it didn't take much to
                        convince him that killing you
                        would make him all better. Of
                        course, he was a loaded gun. He
                        came after me tonight, but...I
                        straightened him out.
 
              His expression goes grim. Lynn can't absorb it, doesn't
              understand any of it.
 
                                  PHILLIP
                        Don't worry, you can ask your dad
                        what I'm talking about when you
                        visit him in hell.
 
              He raises the blade and rushes at her. She stumbles back,
              shoving a tall lamp in his way. He trips over it and falls,
              catching himself at the last second. He regains a measure of
              his dignity, brushing at his pants as he stands.
 
              It might be funny if it weren't for the huge knife in his
              hand.
 
              Lynn's trying to stay cool even though she's deathly
              frightened of the way Phillip looks, the clown makeup
              covering his face.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Phillip. Listen to me. I'm your
                        friend. I want to help you.
 
                                  PHILLIP
                        Do you?
 
                                  LYNN
                        Yes.
 
                                  PHILLIP
                        Then please...let me stab you.

              He feints her way her again. She dodges around the side of
              the sofa.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Phillip--
 
                                  PHILLIP
                        Stop calling me that. My name is
                        Shane.
 
              They are circling each other, the sofa a barrier between them.
 
                                  PHILLIP
                        Would you like to know why you're
                        so afraid of clowns?
 
              She does, but she says nothing.
 
                                  PHILLIP
                        At the hospital, some vapid nurse
                        told you your parents were never
                        coming back so you started crying.
                        There was a clown at the hospital
                        trying to cheer up the kids that
                        day and...he came up behind you
                        and touched your shoulder. I guess
                        he was trying to make you smile.
                        But...you saw him and wouldn't
                        stop screaming bloody murder.
                               (beat)
                        Isn't it interesting how that one
                        moment has shaped the rest of your
                        life?
 
                                  LYNN
                        And you've been...following me all
                        these years?
 
                                  PHILLIP
                        Yes.
 
              Lynn's expression says just how nuts that is.
 
                                  LYNN
                        And Amanda? Julie? Even Nicky?
 
                                  PHILLIP
                        FUCK you, Lynn! What about my
                        parents? What about ME?
 
                                  LYNN
                        What about you?

              She surprises him by moving a little closer, her face showing
              sympathy and kindness.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Phillip...you're nuts.
 
              She punches him square in the face. He's shocked, and hurt,
              falls back on his ass as blood starts to gush from his nose.
 
              Lynn turns and runs.
 
              OUTSIDE
 
              She rushes to the car, fumbling at her keyring for the car
              key. She gets to her door, still sorting through her keys and
              naturally, she drops them.
 
              Phillip bursts out the door, furious. He sees her car, that
              she's not in it. He turns to look the other direction as she
              stands up with the right key in her hand.
 
              He hears, turns toward her. Too late--she's unlocked the door
              and slid in. He rushes over as the car starts, leaping on the
              hood as if he can stop her from getting away.
 
              In reverse, she guns it.
 
              Phillip slides off and hits the driveway painfully. Lynn has
              braked her car short of the road. She puts it in park. Stares
              at Phillip as he slowly stands up.
 
              She looks at Nicky in the back seat, still asleep.
              Something's going through her mind but it's hard to tell what
              it is.
 
              Phillip is walking toward the car now. Twenty feet away.
 
              Lynn puts her hand on the shift lever. Takes a good look at
              the letters. R D N 1 2 3. Reverse takes her away from the
              nightmare walking toward her.
 
              Phillip is fifteen feet away and closing.
 
              Lynn pulls the lever down. Was it one click or two?
 
              She stomps on a pedal and her car surges forward. Phillip has
              time to raise the knife before the car hits him, tossing him
              back into the yard like a rag doll.
 
              She checks on Nicky--still buckled up and unbelievably still
              asleep. Back to front where Phillip lies in an unmoving heap.
 
              Lynn lays her head on the steering wheel in utter exhaustion
              as SIRENS can be heard approaching.

              FADE TO BLACK
 
                                                       FADE IN:
 
              INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
 
              The PHONE RINGS, and Lynn bolts upright in bed. She snatches
              it off the hook.
 
                                  LYNN
                        Hello?
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS (PHONE)
                        Lynn? Thank God you answered. I
                        don't want you to panic--
 
                                  LYNN
                        What? What's happened?
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        Look, I've got men on the way,
                        they'll be there any second.
 
                                  LYNN
                        What is it?
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                               (exhales)
                        Doug Richardson--the clown...he
                        escaped from the prison. I'm sure
                        he's headed out of state as fast
                        as he can go, but I'm sending men
                        over there just to be safe. I want
                        you to stay calm...
 
                                  LYNN
                        When?
 
                                  DETECTIVE PETERS
                        We're not sure, we--
 
              She's already put the phone down and is moving down the hall
              toward Nicholas' room. Detective Peters keeps talking, but
              his voice soon fades away to nothing.
 
              She passes Nicholas' room and goes to the front door. Checks
              the locks. Still locked, the security chain latched.
 
              Relieved, she moves back to Nicholas' room. His door is half-
              closed, and pitch dark inside.
 
              She pushes the door open, but it's still too dark to see
              Nicholas' bed.

              Lynn flicks on the light.
 
              The light comes on for an instant and immediately blows out.
              But in the snapshot flash Lynn sees the clown standing in
              front of her son's bed looking down on him, and at the flick
              of the switch, the clown begins to turn her way.
 
              The room is pitch-black before their eyes can meet.
 
              Lynn's fear is all-consuming. She unwittingly moves back
              against the wall, staring into the dark gaping hole into her
              son's room, so suddenly a mouth into madness.
 
              Too paralyzed to scream, Lynn stares into the darkness,
              waiting for the clown to appear.
 
              CLOSE ON THE DOORWAY
 
              At any second, the clown's horrid face will loom out of the
              black, like a floating head, leering at her.
 
              CLOSE ON LYNN
 
              Lynn's lip trembles. She can't blink. Fear grips her every
              muscle.
 
              CLOSER ON THE DOORWAY
