4n old, gold pocker watch fills the FRAME.

ate 2 group of CHILDREN huddled together staring

MACHEN (CONT'D)
{voice over)
One more story before twelve, just
to keep us warn.

Suddenly Machen's hand grabs the watch and SNAPS it shut!
The children jump, their eyes staring at the watch and then
flicking up to the face of ARTHUR MACHEN.

CLOSEUP - ARTHUR MACHEN

He is a large, round man. He has a full white beard and
wears a sea captain's cap. Dressed in a fading navy blue
pea jacket he wears a white ivory whale's tooth on a chain
around his neck. Machen is an old fisherman who looks
appropriately ominous for the children as he is Lit by the
firelight. 1 .

MACHEN (CONT'D)
In five minutes it will be the twenty-
first of April. One hundred years ago,
on the twenty-first of April, out there
on the water by Spivey Point, a small
clipper ship drew towards land. It was
said that the men on board, all twenty
of them, were rich and carried a great
chalice of gold in their hold. They were
coming here to Antonio Bay to start a new
home. But as they pulled closer and closer
to shore suddenly, ;
out of the night the fog rolled in, a thick
vaporous shroud that covered the ship,
obscuring the shoreline and the bonfire
that the town had set to guide them safely
past the breakers. For a moment they could
see nothing, not a foot in front of them, but
then one or them saw a light through the fog!
By God, it was a fire burning on the shore,
strong enough to penetrate the swirling mist.
_They steered a course toward the light...

Machen glances down at the flickering fire.

MACHEN (CONT'D)
- . . but it was a campfire, like
this one, built by someone down the
beach from the main bonfire.

ANGLE ON CHILDREN

They stare in guilty horror act the fire in fronc of them.

MACHEN (CONT'D)
The campfire guided them toward
Spivey Point the wrong way, toward ©
the breakers.

ANGLE ON MACHEN

MACHEN (CONT'D)
The ship crashed against the rocks.
Its hull sheared in two. The mast
snapped like a twig. The wreckage
sank with all the men on board clawing
and gasping for air as the black ocean
closed in around them. At the bortom of
the sea lay the Elizabeth Dane and her
men, their lungs filled with salt water,
their eyes open and staring in the
dazkness, And up above, as suddenly as it
Had come, the fog lifted, receeded back
across the ocean, and never came again.
But it is told, by the fishermen and their
fathers and grandfathers, that when the
fog returms to Antonio Bay the men at the
bottom of the waters off Spivey Point will
rise up and search for that campfire chat
lead them to their dark, icy death.

ANGLE ON CHILDREN

Terrified, they just stare at the fire. There is a hushed
silence. Just the flickering HISS of the. flames.

Suddenly a CHURCH BELL BLASTS open the silence: GONG! The
children jump and GASP, their eyes wide.

CLOSEUP - MACHEN (EFFECT)

He smiles at-the children and glances at his watch.

MACHEN -
Twelve o'clock, April the twenty-
first . .

CAMERA SLOWLY BOOMS UP from Machen's face, up through the
shadows of trees behind him, up to reveal that we are on a
hillside looking down on Antonio Bay, a small northern
California coastal town, at nignc.

see the lights of Antonio Bay and hear the second GONG
of the church bell.

Slowly we are aware of something moving across the water

in foreground. It is the léading edge of a dense se fogbank
drifting slowly toward Antonio Bay.

Finally the fog completely obscures the lights in the
distance. Silence. The LAPPING of ocean water and
another distant GONG. ia

Then suddenly a black, clawing hand hand EXPLODES through the
surface of the water

It is caked with slime and twisted with seaweed. The
hand REACHES RIGHT AT CAMERA, COVERING THE LENS,
plunging us into BLACKNESS.

MUSIC begins to olay over the radio as CAMERA PULLS BACK -
to reveal BENNETT TRAMER, a gangly 14, as he coils up the
bell rope and ties it to a wooden hook on the wall. He
picks up the portable radio and steps out of the tower.

CAMERA FOLLOWS HIM down a narrow hallway leading up to
a door with a light at the other end. Bennert CLICKS
off the radio and peers in the door.

CAMERA MOVES IN OVER HIS SHOULDER to reveal FATHER
MALONE seated at a table with his back to us. He hasn't
heard Bennett's approach.

BENNETT
I'm all through, Father.

Father Melone turns around, startled. He is a gaunt man
in his forties with a rather good-looking face. He
stares at Tramer anxiously then stands up carefully as if
he is hiding something behind his back. .

FATHER MALONE

need you until four tomorrow. .

He notices that Bennett has forgotten the portable radio
on the table. He picks it up, thinks about going after
the ‘boy, then changes his mind.

FATHER MALONE (CONT'D)
Everything tomorrow.

He CLICKS on the radio and listens a moment, then cocks
his head around as if he has heard something. He shuts
off the MUSIC and strains to hear. Silence.

Then a slight RUSTLING SOUND, a SCRAPING ... . Father
Malone quickly hides the whiskey bottle behind him.

FATHER MALONE.

(into microphone)
I don't think any of us knows
7 . exactly what happened to our
town, ,ronight. Something came
out of the fog and tried to
destroy us. In one moment it
vanished, but if this has been
anything but a nightmare, and
all of us don't wake up to ,
find ourselves safely asleep
in our beds, it could come
again. To the ships at sea
who can hear my voice, look
into the darkness across the
water. Look for the fog .

FADE OUT.
