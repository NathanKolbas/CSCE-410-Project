The SOUND of buzzing bees. The SOUND of a sleepy afternoon,
far from here.

Then a voice, CANDYMAN’s, murmuring so softly that seduction
might be in the air. His voice is dark and rich and filled

with remorse.

A story I heard...

Joey told me.

Clara arches back on the couch, becoming aroused as he
fondles her.

CLARA
Tell it to me...

BILLY

There was this girl, babysitting,
just like you...

(he continues

undressing her as

he speaks)
The kids are asleep and she’s
watching TV, when the phone rings.
She answers it, but there’s nobody
there. She’s about to hang up
when she hears a voice...

Billy slides off her shoes and slowly unbuckles her jeans.

. BILLY
The voice whispers... “bloody
murder...”

Clara shivers. Billy continues to undress her.

BILLY
She hangs up and goes back to
watching TV.
(he runs his hands
over her dress and
down towards her
navel)
The phone rings again. She picks
-up and there’s the voice...

“Bloody murder...” She dials the
operator. The operator says
she’ll put a trace on the line if
he calls back...
(he starts to slide
off her jeans)
He does, though this time the
voice is lcuder... “BLOODY
MURDER!” She freaks. The phone
rings again. She can’t answer it,
just sits on the couch shaking.
. Finally she cicks up, ready to

scream at him... but it’s the
operator. The operator says, “Get
out of the house!! Get out now!!!
We traced the call...”

 

Clara is spooked.

BILLY
“It’s coming from upstairs...”

Clara wriggles off the couch, upset.
BILLY
Hey! I’m sorry... I didn’t scare
you did I?

Clara recovers quickly, but wants revenge.

CLARA
No.
BILLY
(grinning)
oe You sure look scared to me.
CLARA

That’s nothing. I heard that one
before. Come upstairs, I’1l show
you something really scary. But
you have to be quiet...

Billy likes the sound of this.

9 UPSTAIRS LANDING - NIGHT 9
Clara leads Billy past the child’s bedroom to the bathroom,
tiptoeing.

10 INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT 29

Billy and Clara regard their reflections in the mirrored decor
of the medicine cabinet, arms around each other. They talk
in whispers.

CLARA
You ever heard of Candyman?

& BILL
/ No.
 

CLARA
His right hand is sawn off. he
has a hook jammed in the bloody
stump. If you look in the mirror
and say his name thirteen times,
he’ll appear behind you...

Wanna try it?

He grabs her and kisses her. She breaks away.

CLARA
Not here. Go downstairs. I have
a surprise for you...

Billy obeys, his anticipation rising. He exits. Clara locks
the bathroom. door behind him. She reaches in her pocket and
produces a contraceptive cap. She regards herself in the
mirror, a moment of reflection, considering the step she is
about to take. A thought makes her smile...

CLARA

Candyman...

She reaches for the medicine cabinet door and opens it. As
the mirrored door opens, we see for the briefest instant, 4

We are in a research room at the University of Illinois.
Monica sits opposite HELEN, who listens impassively.

Helen barely suppresses a smile.
INT. UNIVERSITY CORRIDOR - DAY 13

Helen and Monica walk into the corridor outside the researc
room. Helen shakes Monica’s hand.

Oh... sorry.
BERNADETTE
It’s okay. We’re pretty much

So... where did you hear this

He laughs inadvertently.

disappointment.

INT, LECTURE HALL - DAY : 16

TREVOR BUCHANAN delivers a lecture from the podium. The
auditorium is about two-thirds full. Trevor is around forty
years old and in good shape. For a professor, Trevor is
quite sartorial, not at all the shabby nerdy cliche.

TREVOR
Anyone here remember the craze for
pet baby alligators?

DIANE raises her arm, Trevor gives her the floor.

DIANE
When they got too large to keep,
people flushed them down the
toilet. They live in the sewers.
Some of them are thirty feet
long...

Trevor grins.

TREVOR
Where did this happen?

DIANE
In Miami. They went blind and
albino from living in the dark.

Another student, DANNY, raises his hand. Trevor gestures to
him to speak.

DANNY
Sir, it wasn't Miami. It was New
York. I read it in the paper...

TREVOR
(sarcastic)
Well then it must be true.

They laugh.

TREVOR
Why would Danny and Diane both be
suffering the same delusion in
cities a thousand miles apart?
Let's face folks there are no
alligators the sewers. These
bizarre events could not have
happened to so many aunts,
cousins, neighbors and friends of
friends...

SPOTTY BOY
It's an example of Jungian
collective unconsciousness...

TREVOR
(groans)
You don't believe that science
fiction mumbo jumbo! ?

They laugh.

TREVOR

No...it'’s bedtime stories...it's
round the campfire. These stories
are modern oral folklore. They
are an unselfconscious reflection
of the fears of Urban society.

(he checks his

watch)
And that's lunch...

The audience breaks up quickly. A group of students surround
Trevor, asking questions. Helen enters as the others file
out the door. She heads for Trevor as he talks to STACEY, a
very pretty coed. Trevor’s enthusiastic hand gestures
accidently brush lightly against Stacey’s chest as he
expounds some arcane theory.

TREVOR
(seeing Helen)
Hi honey.

As she reaches him, he puts his arm around her and kisses
her.

TREVOR
Do you know everybody?
(indicates his
students)
Mark...Danny...Diane...and Stacey.

Helen shakes hands all round.

STACEY
Hi.

Stacey seems to avoid eve contact with Helen.

Trevor and Helen move away from the group and head out of <7
lecture theater. We follow them.

As they walk, passersby acknowledge Trevor.

HELEN
That girl, is she alright? She
wouldn’t look at me and I swear
she was blushing.

Trevor gives a wicked grin.

TREVOR
That’s because she’s in love with
me! All those bursting adolescent
hormones!

Helen gives him a playful whack.

HELEN
Bighead.
(changing the
” subject)
Any news on Purcell?

TREVOR
He's coming in on the redeye
tonight.

HELEN
He got the job.

TREVOR
I'm going to O'Hare to meet him.
Come with me. Make a good

She is by a computer terminal, transcribing the tape. She
types a sentence and restarts the recorder.

MONICA (V.0O.)

She switches the tape off again and starts to type. A knock
on the door disturbs her.

HELEN
Hello...”

The door opens and HENRIETTA, a black woman in her forties,
Peers round the door.

HENRIETTA
Can I clean the room?

HELEN
Sure. Don’t mind me.

Henrietta enters, leaving her cleaning cart in the corridor,
and starts emptying garbage. Helen switches on the tape
gain.

MONICA (V.Q.)
So Billy began... he looked in the
mirror and said, “Candyman...
Candyman... Candyman...”

The tape stops again. Henrietta chuckles at the mention of
Candyman. Helen restarts the tape...

MONICA (V.O.)
..-Candyman... Candyman...

Helen notices Henrietta chuckling to herself.

HENRIETTA
Heh heh, Candyman, eh?
HELEN
You’ve heard of him?
HENRIETTA
Oh yes... oh yes... You doin’ a

study on him?...

HENRIETTA
Yeah... in the projects... I live
on the South Side, so I don’t know
too much about it. My friend know
all about it... her cousin live in
Cabrini. They say he killed a
lady...

Helen’s curiosity is piqued.

HELEN
Could I talk to your friend?

Henrietta laughs.

HENRIETTA
Sure...

She moves to the door and shouts down the corridor.

HENRIETTA
Kitty!

Kitty sits and begins her tale.

KITTY
All I know is this... A lady, she
was in the tub, when she hears a
noise...

Helen pushes the record button on the tape recorder.

HELEN
Do you know her name?

KITTY

right?
Kitty nods.
KITTY

She said, “He’s comin’ through the :

Kitty pauses.

KITTY
When they got there she was dead.

HELEN
She was shot?

KITTY
No. She got killed with a hook...

Helen reacts. Kitty mimes a disembowelment.

It’s true... yes it is. I read it

An internationalist style housing development, tall blocks
clustered around manicured lawns. Doormen, twenty-four hour
security.

HELEN (V.0O.)
Look...

INT. SANDBURGH CONDOS - HELEN AND TREVOR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

The apartment reflects Helen’s enthusiastic and outgoing
nature. It is smart without being uncomfortable. A proper
home.

Helen shows Bernadette a photocopy of the article on Ruthie
Mae’s murder.

BERNADETTE
I don’t like this. This is not
one of your fairy tales. Somebody
really died. It makes me
-uncomfortable...

HELEN
That’s net the half of it.

She hands Bernadette a pile of photocopies. She leafs
through them.

ON THE PHOTOCOPIES
We see a newspaper article about the opening of Cabrini

Green, the buildings all shiny and new. The architect
proudly shaking hands with the mayor.

HELEN
That’s Cabrini Green, not that
you’d recognize it now.

BERNADETTE
No kidding. I won't even drive
past it. I heard a kid got shot
there just the other day.

HELEN
Look carefully at this picture...
(she turns the
page)
++.-and then this one... spot it?

BERNADETTE
No.

HELEN
That’s not Cabrini Green. That’s
this building... Sandburgh
Village! My apartment was built
as a housing project.

BERNADETTE

 

What?

HELEN
Once it was finished, the city
soon realized that there was no
barrier between here and the Gold
Coast; no freeway or El Train to
keep the. ghetto cut off...So they
did some minor alterations, clad
the cinderblock in plaster and
sold the lot off as condos.

: BERNADETTE
How did they get away with that?

Helen gets up and heads for the bathroom.

HELEN
Well they did. Come here...

24 INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

wn Helen shows Bernadette the bathroom. It is small, with the

& shower, the tub, the sink and the toilet crammed in. Above
the sink a medicine cabinet is set into the wall. The .
cabinet has a mirrored door.

HELEN
Here’s the proof.

Helen opens the medicine cabinet.

HELEN

It’s all in the article about
Ruthie Mae’s murder...

(she hands the

Papers to

Bernadette)
The killer, or- killers, they don’t
know which, smashed his way
through the back of the cabinet...

(she raps the back

of the cabinet

with her knuckles)
There’s no wall there. One piece
of plywood separating us from next
door.

Helen starts to pry open the back of the cabinet.

HELEN
Look.

BERNADETTE
Hey! Stop it! There might be
somebody in the bathroom.
HELEN
It’s okay. The apartment’s
vacant.

Helen holds the wood panel open a crack and Bernadette peers
through.

the cabinet.

BERNADETTE
Creepy, eh?

Helen grins.

HELEN
There’s more. They even printed
the address... Apartment 404 is
where it all happened. We finally
have a trail to follow...

They catch sight of themselves reflected in the mirror and
both simultaneously have the same thought.

giggling)

Helen asleep in bed. She is alone. Trevor has not returned.
We move close onto Helen.

The sound of splitting WOOD suddenly wakes her. It is coming
from the bathroom. Helen lies still on the bed, listening.
From the bathroom comes another sound: a male GRUNT.

Still half asleep, and unsure of what is happening, Helen’s
eyes scan the room for a weapon.

She hears FOOTSTEPS walking tot he bedroom. Helen watches
the doorway, silently panicking. She sees nothing, just
darkness.

Then the sound of BREATHING, deep, male, terrifying.
Suddenly, in the gloom, she sees the figure of a MAN, lunging
towards the bed. .

Helen finds her voice and screams. The man grabs her. Helen
fights back with all her strength.

A light is switched on.

TREVOR -
Hey! Calm down! It’s me!

Trevor is holding her. She sees him and stops struggling.
She is still half asleep. ,

TREVOR
Who did you think it was?

He strokes her and kisses her. She puts her arms around him.

HELEN
What time is it?

Helen giggles and they start to make love. Over Trevor's

the city becomes an abstract pattern. The SOUND reaching us
as an eerie cacophony of horns, traffic and distant sirens.

INT. CAR - DAY 29

Helen is driving, Bernadette is next to her. Both are
dressed formally, both seem tense. Bernadette goes through
her bag. We see its contents; a can of Mace, an alarm.
Helen sees her do this.

HELEN
What's with the arsenal? We're
only going eight blocks.

BERNADETTE
You're the one who got us dressed
up like cops.

HELEN
I said dress smartly.

BERNADETTE
We look like cops.

They both look at the barren landscape around them. The
shattered vacant lots are a no-man’s land leading to the
ghetto. Beyond, the grimy towers of Cabrini Green rise over
the horizon.

BERNADETTE
(consulting the map)
Take a left at the lights...

MOVING HIGH ANGLE (HELICOPTER) - DAY 30

Following the car as it turns left and drives into Cabrini
Green. Crumbling highrises slide through the frame as
Helen’s car makes its way across the empty cracked blacktop
past burned out cars and shattered streetlamps.

INT. CAR ~ DAY 31
Helen and Bernadette drive slowly through Cabrini. Guarding
the entrances to the building are groups of Gangbangers.

They stare at the passing car.

HELEN
Which way?

Bernadette’s attention is distracted by the eyes boring ints
her.
 

 

 

22.

BERNADETTE
(hurriedly consulting the map)
Umn... I think...

HELEN
Let’s stop and ask.

BERNADETTE
No... no need... go straight.

They are approaching a highrise, some of its windows boarded
up with planks and metal shutters. The entrance covered in
graffiti. A gash of color against the monotone cinderblock.

HELEN
(seeing the sign on
the building)
Building “2”... this is it.

As they get closer we see that a group of five Gangbangers
stand barring the way to intruders.

HELEN
Let’s go.

Bernadette is staring at the Gangbangers, not wanting to get
out of the car.

HELEN
What d'you think's going to
happen? They're going to shoot
you? Rape you?

BERNADETTE
No...of course not...

HELEN
‘Then let's go.

EXT. CABRINI GREEN DAY . 32

Bernadette gets out of the car after Helen. She tries the
cop walk. The Gangbangers watch their approach.

HELEN
(to Gangbangers)
Hi.

They do not reply but continue staring, unsure of what
they’re dealing with. Helen walks past them to the entrance

hall.

INT. PROJECT BUILDING - DAY 33

Helen and Bernadette stand in the small entrance hall.
Shattered mail boxes opposite steel elevator doors. Every
available surface is covered in graffiti; multiple layers of
designs, names, incomprehensible scrawl. An explosion of
discordant primary colors. i

Inside the building seems so derelict and unwelcoming that no

human being could inhabit it. Helen and Bernadette walk to

the elevators and push the call button. The Gangbangers

watch. There is a long pause. Bernadette feels eyes boring

holes in the back of her neck. Then one of the Gangbangers

gives a short laugh. Helen calls the elevator again. It is
clearly not working. Helen turns determinedly and leads :
Bernadette to the stairwell. They start to walk upstairs. i

INT. STAIRWELL - DAY 34

The windows are boarded and there are no lights. We follow
Helen and Bernadette as they climb the stairs, which twist az
right angles every ten steps. Each corner is totally blind;
who knows what may lie ahead. They hear the Gangbangers
shouting up the stairweil, voices echoing.

GANGBANGER (0.S.)
Yo! Cops comin’ up the back
stair!!

Helen winks at Bernadette.

HELEN
The walk sold it.

Bernadette smiles to cover her anxiety.

INT. RAMP - PROJECT BUILDING - DAY 35

Helen and Bernadette emerge onto a ramp. A grille is fixed
across the balcony like a prison. As they walk along, a
giant message is revealed, painted in extravagant colors on
the opposite wall. It reads:

SWEETS TO THE SWEET

Helen reaches into her bag and produces a camera. She begins
to photograph the graffiti. It is far too large for a single
shot so she moves along the design taking a composite
picture.

A door, completely camouflaged by the graffiti, opens ona
chain. Helen is startled. She sees a Rottweiler growling at
her, held back on a chain. A young woman stares out from
behind the door. She is small and vulnerable: her name is

ANNE-MARIE.

HELEN
Hello... I’m sorry if I-

Anne-Marie slams the door shut, leaving Helen and Bernadette
alone on the ramp again. Helen continues to photograph the
design. The graffiti seems to converge, perhaps even point
to a battered door at the other end of the ramp. Taking
pictures all the way, Helen is inexorably drawn towards the
door. Bernadette follows, increasingly uncomfortable. The
door bears the number 404.

HELEN
Here it is...

BERNADETTE
Someone could be in there.

Helen shrugs and knocks loudly on the battered door.

HELEN
Hello...

No answer. She pushes the door open.
BERNADETTE

(joking to cover her fear)
Don't go in there...

INT. APARTMENT 404 - DAY 36

Harsh sunlight streams in through cracks in the boarding.
They both almost gag on the smell of urine, which, cloying as
incense, permeates the apartment.

BERNADETTE
Jesus, it stinks!

They move past a disemboweled couch, deeper into the gloom.
Their feet squelch on the sodden carpet. The walls are
covered in scrawl. Helen moves along the short corridor to
the bathroom.

HELEN .
See... I was right. The layout is
identical... This must be the
bathroom...

The door is shut. Helen goes to open it.

BERNADETTE
Helen!

HELEN
What’s the problem?

Bernadette has lost her nerve.

BERNADETTE
A woman died in there... leave it.

Helen ignores her. Bernadette turns away as she opens the
bathroom door.

HELEN
It’s okay... there’s nothing to
see.

We see the broken, soiled bathroom fittings. The layout is
the same as Helen’s.

HELEN
Wait a minute...

She sees the medicine cabinet. Helen opens it. The back
pane has been smashed through, leaving a gaping black hole.
Bernadette moves close to Helen, she shivers.

BERNADETTE
That's where he crawled through,
right?

 

 
 

 

 

BERNADETTE (CONT.)

Well, we found it. Let's go.

Helen is taking pictures of the bathroom.

HELEN
Alright...

Bernadette breaths a sigh of relief.

HELEN

hole in the
cabinet)
Just help me up and as soon as I
get back we’ll be out of here.

BERNADETTE
” You’re not serious!

HELEN
It's just a derelict apartment.

BERNADETTE
Then what's the big deal? We
shouldn't be hear.

You want to nail Purcell or not?
BERNADETTE

Of course I do.

Help me up.

Bernadette pauses.

I promise I'll be quick.

INT. APARTMENT BEYOND THE HOLE - DAY 37

Helen moves cautiously through the next door apartment. It
is in a similar state of dereliction. She takes photos,
using the moment of light from the flash on her camera to
guide her way through the sordid piles of garbage. In the
far wall of what must once have been the living room, a large
hole has been sledgehammered. The thin cinderblock smashed
through with ease. Helen clambers through lead deeper and
deeper into this labyrinth.

INT. BEYOND THE. SECOND HOLE - DAY 38

We PULL BACK with Helen as she scrambles through the second
hole. The CAMERA reveals something she has not yet seen:

A VAST HEAD has been sprayed onto the bare cinderblock around
the hole, which is placed centrally like a mouth. Cheekbones
jutting through the dark skin; teeth sharpened to irregular
points, all converging on the hole. It is a face filled with
ruined beauty, at one terrifying and perversely attractive.
A nightmarish vision, to be sure, but somewhere in his eyes
is a melancholy.

Helen turns and sees the painting. His eyes fix mercilessly.
She raises her camera. There is a whirring sound as she has
come to the end of a roll of film. Her bag with the
replacements, she left with Bernadette.

HELEN
Idiot.

Her feet stumble against a squalid mattress on the floor.
She glances down. Something glistens in the light.

Helen beds down to look more closely. It is a handful of

candies — chocolates and caramels — wrapped in bright paper.
She opens one and jumps. Something has pricked her finger.

CLOSE ON THE CANDY

A razor blade has been neatly inserted into the piece of
candy.

gingerly picking through the candy. Underneath it are a

Bernadette jumps, and then helps Helen out of the hole.

HELEN
I've got to go back... ran out of
film...

Bernadette has really had enough.

BERNADETTE
No way!

She closes the medicine cabinet door. As she does so a
figure is revealed reflected in the mirror, standing behind
them. They spin round. The figure is silhouetted against
the daylight from the doorway.

HELEN
Who— ?

The figure holds a Rottweiler at bay on a chain. It is Anne-
Marie, the woman who peered at them from the door.

ANNE-MARIE
Hey! What you doin’ in there?

 

BERNADETTE
We're leaving...

Helen shoots Bernadette a look and approaches Anne-Marie.

ANNE-MARIE
You here for the sweep?

HELEN
We’re not cops.
(extending. her

We're from the University.

ANNE-MARIE

Anne-Marie studies the card. We hear a baby CRYING. Anne-
Marie reacts immediately to the sound.

ANNE-MARIE
My baby.

She walks away from them back down the ramp. Helen follows
with Bernadette in tow.

INT. RAMP - DAY 40
Anne-Marie arrives at her door. Helen close behind.

ANNE-MARIE
Whites don’t never come through
here, ‘cept to cause us a problem.

HELEN
Believe me, that’s the last thing
we’d want to do.

Anne-Marie enters her apartment. We hear the baby HOWLING.
Helen glimpses inside. In total contrast to the abject
squalor of the common parts, Anne-Marie has built a home for
herself. The furniture may be old and tattered, but the
place is clean and comfortable.

INT. - ANNE-MARIE'S APARTMENT - DAY 40A

The Rottweiler holds Helen at the threshold while Anne-Marie
goes to the baby and picks him up.

ANNE-MARIE

Helen and Bernadette move across the threshold and shake her
hand. The dog still keeps his eye on them.

He’s a beautiful boy.

ANNE-MARIE
He’s all I got.

The child is quiet now.

HELEN
What's his name?

ANNE-MARIE
Anthony.

HELEN

I'm sorry if we disturbed you.

BERNADETTE
We'll get out of your way.

It's okay...I don't mean to”be

Baby Anthony is sick on Anne-Marie's shoulder.

Nobody came. Everybody's scared.

Helen and Bernadette have reluctantly accompanied their
spouses.

PURCELL

lip out as far as
it will go)
+..that was how I discovered that
the Poonas think it impolite to
index with their fingers...

Purcell thrusts his lip out again. Archie bursts out
laughing. Helen rolls her eyes up in Bernadette’s direction.
Bernadette gives her a keep-it-quiet look.

TREVOR
Purcell, have you read Janowski’s
latest?

PURCELL
. (snorting)
How am I meant to take that man
seriously, when he dresses out of
an L.L. Bean catalogue?

Archie laughs again. Purcell’s piggy eyes fall on the women.

PURCELL
So how are our two most beautiful
graduate students getting on?
Trevor tells me you’ve been
dabbling in my favorite subject.

Helen’s eyes flash a look. Trevor turns to her imploringly.
PURCELL
(patronizing)
I can’t wait to review your data.

Helen is about to say something, but Bernadette jumps in to
rescue her.

BERNADETTE
We'd really appreciate that,
Purcell.

PURCELL

Marvelous. I think I could fit
you in tomorrow morning.

Helen is alarmed.

HELEN
We’re not ready.

PURCELL

Before you wander off down the
path to academic oblivion.

Archie laughs. Helen grits her teeth.

HELEN
Actually, Purcell, I think we’re
about to bury you.

The table goes quiet. Bernadette looks pained. Trevor
angry.

TREVOR
Helen—

Purcell sits back in his chair, spreading his hands across
his stomach. An embarrassing pause, broken by Archie.

PURCELL
It is a shame, my dear, that you
should be so needlessly arrogant.
After all, I am considered to have
some knowledge of these Urban
belief tales. However, I
won’t push the point. Youth must
be given its head...

Helen bites her tongue. Bernadette tries to make amends.

BERNADETTE
I’m sure in a week or so we'll
have something for you. It’s just
that we only went to Cabrini today
and—

Purcell’s eyes light up.
PURCELL
Ah! Cabrini Green! Candyman
country.

Helen reacts.
 

 

34.

PURCELL
Helen, if you are after the hook-
man, you must read the paper I
wrote about him some, let me
see... ten years ago...

Helen regards him suspiciously.

HELEN
How did you know that we’d traced
the legend to Cabrini?

PURCELL
I didn’t. You are merely
following in my footsteps, re-
inventing the wheel as it were.
You do know the Story, don’t you?

Helen sighs, swallowing her pride.

HELEN
(quiet)
No.

PURCELL
(to the whole table)
Then how on earth are you going to
bury me!

He laughs.

PURCELL
The legend dates back to the time
when Cabrini Green was a good deal
greener than it is today; before
the great fire, around 1890, I
think. Candyman was considered
something of a dandy, a lady's
man, a seducer. Apparently he was
-very good at it and was much
sought after. However, he had the
misfortune to turn the head of the
only daughter of a wealthy
landowner. They met in secret and
were very much in love. He was
black and was white...

   
  

Helen listens, hating the teller, but caught by the tale.

PURCELL
The girl became pregnant and her
father executed a terrible
revenge...

PURCELL (CONT.)

(with relish)
He paid a pack of brutal hooligans
to do the deed; they chased him
through the town to Cabrini Green.
No one had the courage to come to
his aid. They held him down and
sawed off his right hand with a
rusty blade. This was merely the
beginning of his ordeal. He was
stripped naked and spread-eagled
on some rocks. Nearby was an
apiary; dozens of hives filled
with hungry bees. They smashed
the hives, stole the honeycomb and
smeared it on his prone body. He
was stung to death by the bees...

A pause. Purcell has them all rapt.
PURCELL

So, Helen, tomorrow at nine, come

and tell me what you know about

our friend Candyman.
He raps the table with his knuckles, applauding himself.

INT. RAMP - DAY 46

Helen emerges from apartment 404, glad to be out of there.
She walks down the ramp to Anne-Marie’s door. A BOY, eight
years old, stands on the ramp, as if waiting for her. He has
glittering eyes and a strange air about him, as if he were
far older than his years. Helen knocks on Anne-Marie’s door.

BOY
Anne-Marie ain’t in.

HELEN
Oh. Are you sure?

BoY
Yeah. She said you'd be back.

Helen knocks again. The boy stands waiting, impassive.

There is no answer. Helen peers in through the windows. It
is dark inside. Suddenly a pair of eyes confront her. The
dog has jumped up at the window. It stands on its hind legs,
panting., The boy is still waiting. Helen squats down to his
height.

HELEN
What’s your name?

BOY
Jake.

HELEN

Listen, Jake, I’m Helen. Maybe
you can help me. There are some
things I need to know about ‘the
lady who got killed.

Jake does not react.

HELEN
Do you know anything about that?

Jake stand motionless, then slowly shakes his head.

HELEN
Her name was Ruthie Mae.

JAKE
I don’t kncw nothin’.

Jake stares at her.

I ain’t scared of nobody.

You don’t have to tell me
anything.

Just show me... show me where I

And I’1l make a promise to you.
It’ll be our secret.

 

Jake’s face betrays nothing.

49 EXT. STREET - DAY 49

Helen and Jake are on the perimeter of the project. A crummy
little street with a small row of stores. The stores are so
defended with grills and mesh on their windows that it is
difficult to say whether they are open or closed. Nearby is
a basketball court. A group of Gangbangers loiters there.
They watch, but keep their distance. By the basketball court
is a public urinal, a low concrete block, graffiti encrusted
and emitting a stench that leaks out onto the street. Jake
stops in front of it.

Jake points at the door.

JAKE
In there.

HELEN
Candyman is in there?

JAKE
My friend Charlie say so.

A boy get killed there.

Inside, the filth is indescribable. Helen nearly gags as the
stench hits her. There are three stalls opposite three
filth-encrusted urinals. The basins are smashed and hang
limply from the wall. Helen starts taking pictures.

The doors to the stalls are all shut. Helen approaches the
first one, stepping over ominous puddles. She pushes the
door open, revealing a sordid toilet. Helen looks in the
second stall. The same. Helen opens the door to the third
stall. .

On the wall, in massive letters, written in shit, there is a
message:

SWEETS TO THE SWEET

An arrow points to the toilet bowl. Several bees hover
around the toilet. Helen takes a picture and then gingerly
reaches down to lift the lid.

She jumps back.

The toilet bowl is filled to the brim with bees, all feeding
on something unseen. BUZZING angrily. Helen reacts fast and
slams the lid back down. She presses the flush, releasing a
torrent of water. The BUZZING stops as the bees drown.

Helen is left alone in the elevator as it descends. She
fluffs her hair in the mirror, trying to hide a persistent
bruise. The doors open again, revealing a MAN Standing in
the parking structure, reflected over her shoulder in the
mirror.

INT. PARKING STRUCTURE - DAY 72

Helen leaves the elevator and walks towards her car. She
vaguely notices the man, a talk dark silhouette, standing as
if waiting for something, but she pays him little attention.
Helen arrives at her car and searches in her bag for her
keys. A dark shape crosses the foreground.

MAN
Helen...

She turns at the sound of her name. The man stands a short
distance away, silhouetted against a pool of light in the
gloomy parking structure. His voice is rich and sonorous.

HELEN
(friendly)
Yes?

MAN
I came for you.

There is a BUZZING sound, the sound of a sleepy afternoon far
from here.

HELEN
(still friendly)
Do I know you?

MAN
No. But you doubted me.

Helen opens the car door and is about to get in.

: HELEN
I’m sorry. I have to go.

He speaks, murmuring so softly that seduction might be in the
air.

MAN
No need tc leave yet.

He moves towards her and light falls on his face. Helen
freezes. The fine cheekbones, the sparkling eyes. She has
seen this face before.
MAN

You were not content with the

stories, so I was obliged to

come...
He is finely dressed, his dark suit an antique cut. His
right hand hidden in his coat pocket. He pulls his hand out
of his pocket. The hand has been crudely sawn off. A
butcher's hook rammed into the bloody stump.

CANDYMAN

INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT 75

Helen lies sprawled on the floor. She is covered in blood,
as is the bathroom. She checks her torso with her hands.
She is intact, the blood is'not hers. We hear the SCREAMING
and MOANING coming from the other room. The bathroom is
identical to her own, but slowly she realizes where she is;
Cabrini Green.

Helen picks herself up off the floor. The gouts of blood
extend out into the hall. A butcher’s cleaver lies discarded
on the floor. Helen picks it up for protection.

INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT 76

Helen moves gingerly through the dark apartment. The woman's
voice continues. It is Anne-Marie’s voice.

ANNE-MARIE (V.0.)
(screaming)
OH GOD!!! OH GOD!!! HELP ME!!!
HELP ME PLEASE!!!

Moving forward, Helen sees the Rottweiler. It lies dead on
the floor. Its throat ripped out. The screaming comes from
the bedroom door. Helen pushes it open...

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT 17

The door opens to reveal a terrible sight. Anne-Marie stands
twitching and jerking, literally tearing her hair out. In
front of her is the baby’s crib. It is soaked in blood.

ANNE~MARIE .
MY CHILD!!!!! MY CHILD!!! GOD
HELP ME!!!

Helen stands in the doorway, dazed, in shock, soaked in blood
and holding a hatchet. Anne-Marie sees her through her veil
of tears. She lets out a bloodcurdling scream.

ANNE-MARIE
SHE'S HERE!!! SHE’S HERE!!! HELP
ME!!! SOMEBODY!!!

Anne-Marie suddenly lunges at Helen, in an animal rage.

Helen steps back to avoid the onslaught of fists and feet.
She instinctively raises her arms to protect herself. She
catches Anne-Marie on the arm with the cleaver, leaving a

deep gash.

HELEN

No! Stop! Stop!

Helen backs down the corridor, Anne-Marie coming at her

Behind her the sound of SPLITTING WOOD. The front door is

Anne-Marie lunges. Helen pulls the blade away in time.

HELEN
Stop! Calm down!!

ANNE-MARIE
MURDERER!!!

HELEN

The door caves in. Helen glances over her shoulder, still
keeping Anne-Marie at bay.

COP (V.0.)
{through megaphone)
Lay down your weapon!

Several COPS edge their way through the shattered door. Guns
drawn. Helen drops the cleaver and raises her hands.

Anne-Marie rushes at her from behind.

ANNE-MARIE
SHE KILL MY BABY!!!! SHE KILL My
BABY! !!!

Helen is knocked to the ground. Anne-Marie grabs the cleaver
and raises it. A cop grabs her arm. Helen lies still on the
ground waiting for this insane nightmare to end. Anne-Marie

is led away, crying hysterically.

COP
“Stay where you are!!

Helen does not move. She starts shaking.

COP
Don’t move cr we'll shoot!!

She looks up. The cops keep their distance, their guns poinz
at her head, their fingers itchy on the triggers. Her legs
will not move. A cop jumps on her back. He yanks her arms
behind her and slaps on plastic cuffs. Helen is dragged =o
her feet. The cops frog march her outside.

filled with hatred.

Helen is led away, her feet tripping as they frog march her
along.

O’ GRADY
Respond to the question.

HELEN

Frank ignores her and reads from a file.

FRANK
At around ten p.m., Anne-Marie
McCoy returned to her apartment.
She discovered her dog with its
throat cut. She cried for
assistance, at which point you
attacked her with a meat cleaver.
You were still in possession of

blood...

O’ GRADY
You sick fuck.

Helen starts shaking. The detectives stare.

FRANK
Before I ask any further
questions, would you like to have

Helen feels the panic rising, caught in some insane
Kafkaesque nightmare.

frying pan, rams it on the stove and pours a bottle of oil

into it. She turns the gas on high.

Candyman appears in the doorway.

Keep away from me!!

As he stands there we hear the BUZZING of the bees that
emanates from him.

He moves slowly towards her.

CANDYMAN
If you would learn just a little
from me... you would not beg to

live.

Helen glances at the oil, starting to heat. Candyman
advances, his voice dropping to a whisper.

CANDYMAN
I am rumor. It is a blessed
condition, believe me. To live in
people’s dreams; to be whispered
at street corners, but not to have
to be. Do you understand?

The oil is boiling now. Helen waits for the moment to fling
it at him.

CANDYMAN

of my congregation. Without them
Iam nothing. So I was obliged to
come. And now I must kill you...

Helen hurls the pan of boiling oil at him. The oil SIZZLES
on his face and coat, cut Candyman seems unconcerned. She
flings every available spject at him; bottles and plates
shatter around the kit n. Nothing slows his advance.
Helen is backed into the corner. She lashes out with the
knife, trying to keep nim at bay. Candyman grabs the knife
by the blade and pries it from her hand. He jams his hook
under her throat. He whispers in her ear with his sonorcus
seductive voice.

the neck to the groin. Seriously, like a seduction.

CANDYMAN
Think how they would mark this
place with their talk... point it
out as they passed and say, “She
died there, the girl with the
green eyes.” Your death would be
a tale to frighten children. To
make lovers cling closer in their
rapture... Come with me and be
immortal...

He digs the hook into her neck, drawing blood.

No.

She is left alone in the room. Helen’s eyes dart around the
room. She starts to hyperventilate. Through the window in
the door, she sees an Orderly peering in to check on her,
then disappears from view.

HIGH ANGLE
Looking down on Helen strapped to the bed.

Slowly, from underneath the bed, unseen by Helen, Candyman
slides into view.

SIDE ANGLE

on the bed. Candyman suddenly rises into view. His hook
jams against her threat.

He lowers his face close to hers. He is on top of her, but
she can feel no weight. He seems to be floating over her.

CAND YMAN
Shhhhhh... Shhhhhh... They will
not hear your cries...

HELEN
SOMEBODY HELP ME!!!!

He runs his hook up and down her legs, stroking her thighs.

-She shudders at the touch of the cold metal.

CANDYMAN
Was immortality ever so easy? Be
my victim...

HELEN
GET OFF ME!!!

CANDYMAN

Allow me at least, a kiss...
She turns her face away from him.

CANDYMAN
Just one exquisite kiss... I beg
you... ,

She turns suddenly to his and spits in his face.

HELEN
MURDERER! !!

Candyman strokes her inner thighs, gently.

CANDYMAN
What do the good know? Except
what the bad teach them by their
excesses.

He positions his hook to strike, from the groin upwards
through the chest. Helen freezes.

 

CAND YMAN
I won’t fsrce it upon you. I
won’t ob @ you to die. But

think, you have seen the invisible
and experienced the irrational.
They have not. They will all
abandon you. All you have left is
my desire for you...

HELEN
I will destroy you. You are evil.

Candyman seems sad at her rebuttal.

CANDYMAN
You cannot. I have the child. He
will die so that my notoriety
lives on...

Helen glances at the door. An Orderly approaches. She sees
her chance.

HELEN
HE’S HERE!!! HE'S HERE!!!

The Orderly peers in. Candyman darts back under the bed.

HELEN
HELP ME!!! HE’S UNDER THE BED!!!

The door to the isolation room bursts open. Two Orderlies
enter. They see Helen writhing and screaming in her
restraints. There is nething under the bed.

The Orderlies barely react. This is an everyday occurrence
on the ward. One of them prepares a hypodermic of thorazine.

1ST ORDERLY
Give her fifty mils, she’s waking
the others...
Helen takes the massive dose, injected fnto her arm.

FADE TO:

INT. ISOLATION ROOM - DAY 215

Helen wakes on the bed. Orderlies are undoing her
restraints. Helen sits up groggy.

She stands, a little unsteady but feeling physically fine.

INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR ~- DAY 116

We move with Helen as she is led down the corridor by the two
Orderlies. She passes wards where patients sit shoveling
food into their mouths or just staring into space. Some
twitch and jerk and jabber to themselves.

The pass through doors. The Orderlies carefully unlock and
relock them as they continue through the hospital.

They arrive at an office door and enter.
INT. DOCTOR JAFFE’S CONSULTATION ROOM - DAY 2117

As Helen is shown in, DOCTOR JAFFE, a clinical psychiatrist
in his mid-forties, stands and extends his hand. The
Orderlies exit and close the door.

DR. JAFFE
Ms. Buchanan... Dr. Jaffe...
please, sit...

He_gestures to a chair. Helen looks at him warily.

HELEN
(still standing)
I want to see my husband.

DR. JAFFE
I’m sure we can arrange a visit.

Helen laughs.

HELEN
What?! Have I been sectioned?
How long have I been here?

Jaffe leans forward.

DR. JAFFE
Helen, please, why don’t you sit
down.

She sits.
 

 

74.

DR. JAFFE
You probably remember little or
nothing of the past month. You
have been on a heavy dosage of
thorazine. We had to stabilize
you before...

HELEN
A month?!

DR. JAFFE
We have to assess your fitness to
stand trial. ,

Helen is shocked.

 

HELEN
Get me my attorney.
DR. JAFFE
This was his suggestion.
(pause)

You have been charged with first
degree murder.

HELEN
That’s absurd!

DR. JAFFE
Tell me why.

HELEN

He broke in... through the
medicine cabinet.

The awful memory of the disemboweled body.

HELEN

Dr. Caffe consults a document ca his desk.

DR. JAFFE
According to the police report,
there were no signs of forced
entry...

HELEN
That’s wrong. I saw him. I...

DR. JAFFE
Describe him.
 

 

Helen does not reply.

DR. JAFFE
How does he appear to you?
(pause)
Does he speak to you?

HELEN
I am not hallucinating.

DR. JAFFE
Have you considered that properly?

Helen is silenced.

DR. JAFFE
The night you were admitted. Did
he appear to you?

HELEN
(quiet)
Yes.

Dr. Jaffe turns to a video recorder and pushes play. On the
TV we see an image of Helen in the isolation ward. She
starts to writhe...

HELEN
(on TV)
HE’S HERE! HELP ME!! SOMEBODY

HELP ME!!

WE MOVE slowly towards Helen as she watthes. On screen she
jerks like a rag doll; there is nobody else in the room.
Helen starts to cry silently. Or. Jaffe switches off the
tape and watches her.

Tears flow down Helen’s cheeks.

HELEN
-I killed my best friend... she
trusted me... she loved me... I
cut her open... I... it’s not
possible... it’s...

Jaffe stares; Helen stcps crying.

HELEN
Whatever happening to me...
whatever is going wrong, I know
one thing. <I am not capable of
that. No part of me, however
hidden, could do that...

Jaffe stares.

 

HELEN
I can prove it.

Jaffe is intrigued.

DR. JAFFE
How?

Helen turns to a mirror mounted on the wall.

HELEN
I can call him.

Jaffe watches as Helen moves to the mirror and begins the
incantation.

HELEN
Candyman, Candyman, Candyman,
Candyman, Candyman, Candyman,
Candyman, Candyman, Candyman,

She turns back to Jaffe, their eyes meet. Helen faces the
mirror.

Candyman...

Nothing. Jaffe draws a slow breath, about to speak, a
sympathetic smile crosses his face.

SUDDENLY!
BLOOD POURS FROM JAFFE’S MOUTH!!!

Helen spins round.

over Jaffe’s body. There are urgent KNOCKS on the door.

ORDERLY (0.S.)
Dr. Jaffe? Dr. Jaffe? Is
everything alright?

The door handle turns, it is locked. Helen stares at it,
vibrating with shock. A loud THUD, as they start to force

the door.

Helen heads for the broken window. She climbs out onto the
ledge.

EXT. HOSPITAL - HIGH ANGLE - DAY 118
Helen emerges from inside. She is thirty stories up. The
wind buffets her. She looks across at the next window. She
might be able to reach it.

Hanging on by her fingernails, Helen slowly edges across to
the next window.

INT. WARD - DAY 119

“Helen appears at the window of a ward. Some patients see her

and start laughing. A NURSE rushes over and opens the
window.

NURSE
What the-?

Helen kicks the nurse in the face, sending her crashing
backwards.

INT. CORRIDOR - DAY 120

Helen heads down the hospital corridor. She is dressed in
the nurses uniform. Pandemonium has broken out. People rush
to and fro. Jaffe’s body has been discovered.

GUARD

Seal off the wards!!

Helen unlocks a door with the nurses passkey. She heads fcr
the elevator. She calls it and waits. The elevator arrives
and she gets in.

Helen pushes the ground floor button. She anxiously watches
the lights as she descends, praying the elevator won’t stop.

EXT. CITY STREET - MOVING WITH HELEN - DAY 124

Helen runs through the city, through jostling crowds. The
NOISE of the street batters her ears. A police car pulls
into the curb behind her. Cops get out of it and run towards
her.

CLOSE ON HELEN

running for her life, barging through crowds. She has gone
three blocks before she glances over her shoulder. The Cops
are nowhere to be seen. She pauses, her breath coming in
vasping gulps. Her stomach knotting in pain.

HELEN
Be home, Trevor... please be
home...

She pushes on, heedless of the traffic forced to break hard,
HORNS sounding.

EXT. HELEN’S APARTMENT BLOCK - DAY 125

Helen stumbles forward as fast as her exhausted legs will
carry her. -

INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE HELEN’S FRONT DOOR - DAY 126

Helen arrives at her apartment. MUSIC is playing inside. A
moment of relief. Trevor is home. She leans against the
door for support, about to press the buzzer. To her
surprise, it swings open, unlocked. Still breathing heavily,

she enters.
INT. APARTMENT - DAY 127

Moving inside, Helen barely recognizes the place as her heme.
Some walls are stripped, ready for painting, others are
completed. Dust covers hide the furniture. POP MUSIC is
blasting from the STEREO. Helen moves into the kitchen.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY 128

All the smashed kitchen units have been removed. And, for
that matter, everything else she had put in. Although half-
finished, the redecorated kitchen is clearly in a totally
different style from her taste.

Helen moves through to the living room, the MUSIC masking any
sound from her rasping breath.

INT. LIVING ROOM - HELEN’S POV - DAY 129

Entering the living room. Rounding the corner, a ladder
comes INTO VIEW. On it stands a woman dressed only ina
man’s shirt, working away happily with a paint roller,
humming along to the crass MUSIC.

ON HELEN

moving into the room and sitting on the brand-new couch. Her
entrance unnoticed by the woman. Helen recognizes her
though.

It is Stacey, the nubile coed she met at his lecture. Helen
watches her, as her breathing calms, the awful truth sinking
in.

Stacey merrily continues painting. She completes a section
of wall and glances over to the next bare patch. Stacey
double takes. She stares frozen at Helen standing there
dressed as a nurse.

Helen moves towards her, to switch off the music. Stacey
back away, thinking she is coming at her. She half falls off
the ladder. Stacey shrieks.

STACEY
(shouting, scared)
Trevor!

Helen takes a step towards her; she flinches.

TREVOR (0.S.)
(mild concern)
You alright in there, darling?

STACEY
(to Helen)
-Don’t hurt me.

HELEN
Get out of my home.

Trevor enters, dressed in his bathrobe. The sight of Helen
stops him dead in his tracks.

HELEN

She moves towards him; he steps back from her as weil.

TREVOR

Stacey moves for the telephone. Helen spins around with
sudden aggression.

_ HELEN
Don’t touch that!

Stacey jumps back from the phone. Helen spins back to
Trevor. He flinches from her.

HELEN
Scared of something, Trevor?

Trevor and Stacey exchange a look. They are really
frightened. Helen folds her arms and considers the new

decor.

HELEN
I hate the color scheme.

She picks up a pot of paint and flings it with great force at
the wall. Paint splashes everywhere.

HELEN
What were you going to do Trevor?
Wait till I got out before you
told me?

TREVOR
Helen...

HELEN
‘You knew I was never coming out.
Didn’t you?

TREVOR
I... I think we should call the
hospital...

HELEN
If that’s what you want, go on, do
it.

A pause. Nobody moves.

HELEN
(she starts to cry)
I’m not a murderer... I’m not...
(she sits)
You’re all I had left... it’s
over...

 

Trevor takes a step towards her.

TREVOR
I’m so, so sorry...

Helen makes a sudden move. Trevor jumps back like a scalded
cat. Helen stands slowly and leaves. They stand back from

her, terrified.

As soon as she is out the door, Trevor dives for the phone
and dials 911.

130 EXT. CHICAGO RIVER - DAY 130

Helen walks slowly to the edge of the riverbank. She stands
regarding the dirty water swirling below her. A jump and it
would all be over. Someone else’s problem.

EXT. CABRINI GREEN - NIGHT 131

The ominous silhouettes of the project buildings stand dark
against the night sky.

INT. RAMP - NIGHT 132

Outside apartment 404. A group of Gangbangers patrol the
ramp, heading off down the stairwell. When they have gone,
we see Helen hiding in the shadows. She takes a pencil torch
from her pocket and pushes open the door to apartment 404.

INT. APARTMENT 404 - NIGHT 133

MOVING WITH HELEN

as she makes her way through the shattered apartment, a small
pool of light from the torch leading the way.

INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT 134

Helen faces the medicine cabinet. She slowly opens it. [In
the void beyond burns a flickering orange light. Gathering
her courage, she climbs through the hole.

INT. BLOODY CHAMBER - NIGHT . 135

Helen moves into the first blood spattered room. A few
candles sputter weak light on the floor. She climbs through
the hole into the second chamber.

BEYOND THE SECOND HOLE - NIGHT 136

Helen emerges out of the mouth of the portrait of Candyman.

A hook comes down from above thrusting into her face. She
jumps back reflexively and then sees; she has bumped into cre
of the butcher’s hooks that dangle from the ceiling. She
slides the hook out from the ring that holds it. Now she has
a weapon. Helen moves towards the large hole at the end c=
this chamber. The hole is an inky black void. She shines
her torch into it, but beam cannot reach the far wall.
The sound of drips falling in puddles REVERBERATES from the
void. Whatever is beyond, it is some massive cavern. Helen

climbs through.

 
 

 

137

INT. CANDYMAN’S LAIR - NIGHT 137

Helen moves through the dark chamber, sticking close to the

wall. The light from her torch reveals a series of murals.

In the manner of paintings depicting the progress of a saint
they show:

Candyman being chased through the town by the brutal
hooligans. A crowd looking on, none lifting a finger to come

to his aid.
Candyman stripped naked, his hand being sawn off.

Finally, Candyman splayed out on the rocks, being stung to
death by the bees.

From somewhere in the darkness, Helen hears the sound of
BREATHING, deep and slow.

Across the vast chamber, many walls smashed through to create
a cavernous space within the building, she sees something in

the dim light.

It is a bed made from a bloody butcher’s slab. Upon it lies
Candyman, asleep on his back.

Helen moves silently towards him, brandishing her hook.
Ready to strike.

She moves closer and closer, listening to his regular
BREATHING. Praying that he does not wake up. She is now
close enough to plunge the hook into his head. She raises
her arm.

We see his face. His eyes are open.

CAND YMAN

She smashes the hook down, into his neck. Candyman hardly
flinches. He pulls it out as if it were only a thorn.

He places the hook in the small of her back, holding her
elegantly. He leads her into a dance.

CAND YMAN
... forever?

They waltz through the chamber, as if not quite touching the
ground.

HELEN
The child... we had a deal.

~ CANDYMAN
Surrender to me now and he shall
be unharmed.

As they dance, Candyman slowly raises the hook sensuously up
her back. The hook caresses her neck from behind. Gently at
first, but then with enough pressure to nick the flushed skin
of her neck. She trembles in his arms.

CANDYMAN
Be my victim.
HELEN
No... wait... please...
CANDYMAN
We have a bargain.
HELEN
I’m afraid.
CANDYMAN
Do you fear the pain, or what is
beyond?
HELEN
Both...
CAND YMAN
The pain, = can assure you, will
be exquisite... as for the

beyond... there is no permanence
for us in death. Our deeds will
be on a nundred walls and ten
thousand s. Should they doubt
us again, we can always be
summoned with sweetness...

  
 

He scoops her up in his arms and leads her to the slab. He
lays her on it.
 

85.

HELEN
I don’t want to be remembered that
way. I want to be forgotten...

Candyman slides his hook along her leg and thigh. His
hypnotic presence and his silky voice seducing her.

CANDYMAN
Helen...Helen, have you never lain
awake at night sweating with
terror at the thought of oblivion,
of ceasing to exist...and felt
that dark expanse of nothingness
overwhelm you. That is indeed a
thing to fear.

He has struck a chord in her.

CANDYMAN
Come with me and be immortal.

The hook’slides up her skirt. Helen is aroused.

CANDYMAN
We shall give them something to be
haunted by. That, and a story to
tell...

He bends down towards her. He stokes her inner thigh with
his. hook.

CANDYMAN
Out of the eater came forth meat,
and out of the strong came forth
sweetness.

Helen’s hand slides into Candyman’s jacket. And then
withdraws fast, as if stung by something.

Candyman’s jacket flaps open and she sees—

The contents of his torso have been eaten away. The hollow
is now occupied by a nest of bees. They swarm in the vault
of his chest, encrusted in a seething mass in the remnants sf
flesh that hang there. Helen SCREAMS.

CANDYMAN
Sweets to the sweet.

His mouth is close, about to kiss her. His mouth is filled
with bees!
 

 

138

HELEN
Nooooo00!!!! Noooooo!!!!

The bees suddenly swarm from his mouth, covering her.

Helen withes in agony as the bees cover her; moving on her,
searching for morsels of wax in her ears. Sucking at the
sugar from her lips. The bees are stinging. The NOISE
deafening. His mouth presses to hers. Her tongue forced
into the hive. Candyman stares at her. He is saddened by
her obvious répuision. Helen blacks out...

FADE TO:

INT. CANDYMAN’S LAIR - NIGHT (LATER) 138

Helen wakes on the slab. She swats the air and brushes her
body. She has ben stung but is otherwise unharmed. A few
bees circle the air. Candyman has gone. She sits up.

Some candles have been lit, illuminating a section of wall.
Candyman has written a message. It reads:

From somewhere in the far distance comes an unmistakable
sound. The thin plaintive WAIL of a baby crying. Helen
tries to identify the direction of the sound. She Picks up
the hook she dropped earlier and moves cautiously towards the
sound.

MOVING WITH HELEN OUT OF APARTMENT 404 - NIGHT 139

Helen makes her way out of the apartment, following the trail
of the baby’s CRYING. She climbs through the first hole.

The CRYING crescendos. She dreads the sight that will await
her, but through the hole there is nothing. All is quiet.
Then she hears the CRYING again, further on. She follows the
sound.

INT. RAMP OUTSIDE APARTMENT 404 - NIGHT 140

Helen moves silently along the ramp, keeping to the shadows.
She clutches the hook, ready for a confrontation.

Helen listens at the dark windows of apartments for the sound
of the baby. Nothing. And then it begins again, a distant
WAIL, coming from the blacktop.

Helen presses her face to the wire mesh, listening. In the
center of the blacktop looms the pile of broken furniture and
dead saplings, a makeshift bonfire. She hears the CRY again.
It is coming from within the pile. a

EXT. BLACKTOP - NIGHT 141

Helen moves quickly to the edge of the piled timbers and
furniture. She finds a narrow gap, a hollow in the pyramid.
The CRYING has stopped. There is only silence. She moves a
piece of broken wood and bars the entrance. [It slips from
her grip and CLATTERS to the ground.

Helen squeezes through the narrow aperture. Her hands
finding wood and rags-and what feels like the back of an old
armchair, but not the warm skin of the child.

She pushes on, deeper and deeper into the heart of the
bonfire. Her dress snags on a nail. Her shins are scrapped,
her fingers spiked with splinters.

And there, no more than a yard ahead of her, is the child.
Lying in a crude crib of rags, arms and legs waving. He
smiles at the sight of her, not crying now.

Helen ducks down to reach beneath a beam of wood, but her
fingers miss the forlorn bundle by inches. She stretches
farther, but still she cannot reach the child.

HELEN

Jake leads a group of big Guys silently down the stairs. One
of them carries a can of gasoline.

Helen bends double to squeeze into the hidey-hole. The space
is so small, she can barely get through. She wrenches
herself past the nail covered beams, not caring as her flesh
is ripped and torn. Finally, she makes it and picks up the
child to comfort him. A wide hand covers Helen’s face. She

The match hits the fire and flames roar up.
INT. BONFIRE

Helen fights to be free of Candyman, to cry out to them, but
he holds her lovingly close. Fire roars up around them.

CANDYMAN
Hush my darling... Hush...

Through the first flames, Helen sees a crowd approaching the
fire. Drawn out of their homes by the sudden conflagration.
As the people gather, a chant goes up.

VOICES
BURN HIM!!! BURN HIM!!! BURN
HIM!!!

Helen tries desperately to cry out. The roar of the flames
gets louder and her muffled cries are lost in the sound of

the chanting. .

She sees how the children’s faces gleam; their parents
calling them for going too close, and how they disobey. She
sees Old Women, chanting, angry, warm their thin blood and
smile into the flames.

The ROAR and CRACKLE of the fire becomes deafening. Secure
that she could not be heard, Candyman takes his hand from
Helen’s mouth.

Helen screams her lungs out as the air becomes hotter and the
flames start to penetrate the interior of the pyre.

HELEN
HELP ME!!! GOD HELP ME!!!

She can neither be seen cor heard through the flames.

The child lies in Helen’s arms, helpless as the flames neat
and the choking smoke begins to curl around him. Helen helis
him close to her breast, trying to protect his fragile lunss

from the searing heat. She turns to Candyman, her voice
cracked and hoarse from the futile screaming.

HELEN
You promised me...

CAND YMAN
It’s too late now...

Helen holds the child tighter, trying to curl away from
Candyman’s embrace.

HELEN
We made a deal...

Looking through the flames at the chanting faces, Helen sees
Anne-Marie staring into the fire. Anne-Marie does not chant,
she just stands there, her face a mask of tragedy.

HELEN
(her lungs choking)
See her! See her face!! You lied
. to me!!

Helen hides the child in her dress, trying desperately to
protect him as the inner sanctuary of the pyre flames up.

CANDYMAN
(sad)
We must be on our way now, you and
I. :

Fire is all around them. Anne-Marie’s face seems to stare at
her, all other faces becoming monstrous, confused. Helen
looks at the bundle cradled to her chest. The child’s eyes
penetrate her, pleading for life. Helen suddenly heads right
into the flames. Candyman grabs her, holding her back.

HELEN
Let me go!!

CAND YMAN
I cannot.

She struggles with all her strength.

HELEN
We made 4 deal!!

No!

She breaks his grip and plunges into the flames, shielding
the child’s body, heading for Anne-Marie.

CANDYMAN
Helen!
(terror crosses his
face)
You can’t make it!

The shaky construction of the pyre suddenly heaves as it
burns, collapsing.

A falling beam lands on Helen, trapping her. She struggles
frantically as her dress catches fire. She sees Anne-Marie,
staring but not seeing.

Burning debris showers down on Candyman.

CANDYMAN
I would have loved you for all
eternity...

Helen curls over the baby, unable to continue, waiting to be
consumed by the flames. The watching faces, Anne-Marie,
Candyman and the still wriggling child all float before her
as her life ebbs away. Candyman calls to her as she burns.

CANDYMAN
I loved you.

An almighty. CRASH and a shower of sparks. The fire is
collapsing. Helen waits to be completely engulfed. But she
looks up, still alive. A path has been cleared out of the
fire. The beam trapping her has been dislodged.

Clasping the baby, Helen drags herself to the opening.
OUTSIDE THE FIRE

somebody SCREAMS.

The chanting stops as one by one they see the terrible sigh=:
Helen crawling out of the inferno. Flames rising from her
back. Nobody moves; czhey watch appalled as Helen makes her
terrible journey, dragging herself to Anne-Marie.

A blanket is thrown over Helen. Men try to beat out the

flames — a terrible incomprehensible cry comes from her
mouth.

 
 

92.

Helen rolls over onto her back, revealing the baby cradled in
her arms. Anne-Marie bends down and takes him, tears of joy

‘flowing. He is unharmed.

INSIDE THE FIRE
Candyman burns.

CANDYMAN
Come back to me!

He lifts his head, totally aflame now.

- CANDYMAN
Come back!!

He throws his head back and gives voice to an appalling ROAR
of anguish and pain.

OUTSIDE THE FIRE

The roar of agony chills the crowd as it REVERBERATES around
the blacktop.

INSIDE THE FIRE

Candyman’s jacket bursts open and the bees rise as a swarm
from his chest, some catching alight like tiny meteors.

 

OUTSIDE THE FIRE

Helen tries to sit. Men hold her down. It is the image from
the mural, reproduced exactly.

A massive cloud of bees and sparks rises into the night sky.
The fire collapses, engulfing Candyman. Jake looks into the
fire and sees Candyman burn, a shapeless lump now.

ON HELEN
She lies back, weak.

HELEN’S POV

The sound becomes MUFFLED. Faces surround her. Everything
seems distant.

A strange calm fills her face.

Hands take hold of her and lift her gently onto a gurney.

wheeled past them to the waiting ambulance.

Shhhhh...

As Helen is lifted into the back of the ambulance, her gaze
moves up to the night sky.

HELEN’S POV

Sparks shooting out into the sky, like spermatozoa. The
sparks dim as they fall and the screen darkens.

ON HELEN
Her face is at peace now, as she dies...
FADE OUT.

Priest officiates.

Trevor watches, sad. Purcell is there, as is Archie who
looks a shadow of his former jovial self. A few others we co

not recognize also attend.

Stacey hangs discretely in the background.
In the distance, they suddenly hear MUSIC.

The mourners turn and see snaking its way through the
tombstones towards them, a procession.

It is the people from the project, maybe three hundred

strong.

They make their way to Helen’s grave, musicians PLAYING.
They are somber, but there is an air of celebration about

them.

At the head of the column are Anne-Marie and Jake.

Anne-Marie holds the baby in her arms.

They arrive at the grave.

Jake reaches in his pocket.

Trevor is moved.

He pulls out Candyman’s hook.

He throws the hook into the grave.

Anne~Marie throws a handful of candy onto the coffin.

We see Helen’s coffin, the hook
