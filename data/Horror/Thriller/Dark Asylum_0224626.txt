PHOTO MONTAGE

Various sepia toned images of Matthew Brady-type Civil War
PHOTOGRAPHS. The final image is that of a makeshift
graveyard. A frayed Confederate flag blows in the wind.

DISSOLVE TO:
INT. NORTHERN UNIVERSITY / CLASSROOM AMPHITHEATER - DAY

The final image of the Civil War graveyard is now projected
on a classroom screen. COLLEGE KIDS sit at their desks,
glassy eyed and open mouthed. PROFESSOR ACKERMAN walks
among them; bearded, bespectacled and bewitched by his
manic reverie.

ACKERMAN
More American citizens, 618,002 to
be exact, died in our own Civil War
than in both of the so-called...
(makes quotes with his fingers)
..."World Wars" combined.

In the front row, a sexy AFRICAN AMERICAN COED mimics
Ackerman's hand gesture. Beside her sits ANDERSON LEE, the
ultimate golden boy: charming, muscular body, sensitive
eyes... Basically, the model student, were he not fixated
on

the girl's uncovered thigh, a predicament which brings this
shapely nymphet much amusement.

ACKERMAN

Now when we consider how the North
ended the Civil War with General
Sherman's vindictive march through
Georgia, his Union troops raping,
looting, hell, annihilating dozens
of small towns swept away in the
carnage...

Inexplicably, this information appears to turn on the Coed,
which, of course turns on Anderson... And the Professor.

ACKERMAN
».-well, we can truly understand
the rage, the betrayal the South
felt towards the North, and, to
some degrees, still feels today.

Ackerman now notices an empty fast food box on Anderson's
desk.

ACKERMAN

Speaking of carnage... Is that a
CarnoBurger you got there, Anderson?

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

ANDERSON
Um... yeah.

ACKERMAN
Did you know the meat in that six
ounce patty most likely came from
as many as 1000 different cows?

Two rows back sits CORY JONES, the closest thing to an
intellectual in the Northern U fraternity. Half asleep,
Cory slumps at his desk, unaware of the raging hard-on
poking through his Bilabongs.

NELSON ELLIOT, however, does notice. An uncompromising,
unrelenting (and uncoordinated) court jester, Nelson dumps
his Pepsi Blue on Cory's crotch, jolting him from his daze.

CORY
Mommy!!!!

The entire class turns to stare at Cory. But not Ackerman.
He's still on his roll...

ACKERMAN
The need to produce the cheapest
product possible commands that the
fast food chains literally own the...
(makes quotes with his fingers
"Smiley Meal" from its very birth.

Anderson makes the quote gesture to the teasing Coed who
once again giggles. Winks.

ACKERMAN
Thus your CarnoBurger is born a
cow, and your ChickNugget, a
beakless, large breasted mute.

NELSON

Sounds like your sister, Corndog!
CORY

Nelson... Lick my rim.

The bell RINGS. Books are gathered. Hi-fives exchanged.
These kids are the fuck outta there.

ACKERMAN
Fine. Good. Go! But the next
time you all pig out, be aware...
You are what you eat!
EXT. NORTHERN UNIVERSITY CAMPUS - DAY

Our trio walks along the campus, inhaling the fresh air.
Nelson carries a boogie board.

ANDERSON
Oh, Northern-U, venerated dwelling
place of those who got wait listed
at real colleges, we bid thee adieu
for ten long days...

NELSON
Of killer surf...

CORY
And genetically altered, ice cold
brew...

NELSON
And fine ass...

An obscenely CURVACEOUS COED walks by, brushing the guys
aside with obvious distaste.

NELSON
Ahem, mighty, fine ass...

She gives Nelson the finger as she disappears.

NELSON
That is pure sexual harassment.

EXT. FACULTY PARKING LOT - DAY

They arrive at the lot. Top down, Anderson's convertible
muscle car sits at the end, parked perpendicularly across
two spots. Several parking tickets grace the windshield.

ANDERSON
These tickets are three weeks old.

CORY
Then they're probably no good.

Cory grabs the tickets and puts them on a late model Volvo
in the adjacent spot. Nelson begins tearing off his clothes,
ranting like the madman that he is.

NELSON
Bond with the boys! Stick it in
the puss! Bond with the boys...

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

Down to his "Beach Fun" swim trunks, Nelson hops round the
lot. Eternally immune, Anderson and Cory focus on clearing
out the many beer bottles and junk food wrappers which
clutter the otherwise spotless convertible.

CORY
You know, dude, as excited as I am
that now is now, you know, Spring
Break, time to get savaged by some
slop-drunk "Babes Gone Wild" hotties,
I’m also kinda realizing that the
deal of a major life experience like
this is the "looking forward to", as
opposed to the actual "doing of"

  

Anderson looks blankly at Cory.

ANDERSON
Corndog, have you been jacking off
with your mother’s hand créme again?

CORY
(after a beat)
Maybe just a little...

Professor Ackerman arrives, arms full of books for the
spring break “read”. He pauses by the Volvo (which is, of
course, his), and removes the tickets.
ACKERMAN
Congratulations, Mr. Lee, on being
assigned a spot in the faculty lot.
Ackerman studies Anderson's horrid parking job. Amused.
ACKERMAN
Is this what you call parking...
(makes quotes with his fingers
-.."outside the box"?

ANDERSON
Hey, I like that!

Ackerman hands Anderson the clump of tickets.

ACKERMAN
Too bad the Meter Maid didn't.

Nelson hops over, boogie board in tow.
NELSON

Yo, Professor Ackerman! I was just...

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

ACKERMAN
I take it this will not be a trip
devoted to what Joseph Campbell
refers to as the “Journey Within’?

CORY
Oh, we plan to journey within, sir.
Just not inside a book.

The African American Coed from class enters the lot.
Anderson poses and smiles... as the Coed walks right past
him to Ackerman, seductively adding her books to his pile.

ACKERMAN
Now, if you'll excuse me, boys,
I have my own noble quest to take
care of. See you next Wednesday.

Ackerman loads the girl into his car. The guys can only
stare in awe.

ANDERSON
It's good to be the Professor.
EXT. NORTHERN UNIVERSITY FACULTY PARKING LOT - DAY
A beat later...
The convertible backs out of the lot. Anderson sits behind
the wheel, Cory rides shotgun. The half naked Nelson stands
on the back seat, beach ball in hand, guiding Anderson past
their fellow STUDENTS who dart out of the way.
NELSON
Left... Left... Right... Right...
Bingo! Now point this fucking thing
south, son!

EXT. NORTHERN UNIVERSITY - DAY

The car hurls away from the school. Let the road trip begin!

EXT. HIGHWAY (NORTHERN LANDSCAPE) - DAY
Top down, the guys take in the smog filled freeway.

NELSON
(offscreen/singing)
Waste me! Lay my body bare!
Waste me! Push my soul to care!
INT. ANDERSON'S CONVERTIBLE (DRIVING) - DAY

Nelson strums an acoustic guitar in the back seat, warbling
along to the RADIO. Poorly.

CORY
Hey, Nelson. Who sings this again?
NELSON
That would be my favorite new band,
Waste.
CORY
Right. So keep it that way.
NELSON
Oh, fuck you, Corndog!
CORY
That's witty.
ANDERSON

Enough, girls! Time for today's
"Sucks to be You".

NELSON
Man...

CORY
Bring it, baby.

ANDERSON
Okay, Cory, since you're so up for it.
You will either, A, star in a new
reality show, which you discover too
late is a gay version of "Survivor"...

NELSON
Brutal!

ANDERSON
...and your one pair of tightie
whities has a huge hole in the ass,
an incredible turn-on for the all
male cast, or...

NELSON
Ouch!!!

ANDERSON
...-B, go down on Chelsea Clinton in
front of your entire family, S.C.S.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

CORY
S.C.S.?

ANDERSON
Stone cold sober, bro.

Cory winces. Contemplates the implications of both.

CORY
Can't I just kill myself?

NELSON
You know the rules! Don't choose
one, you get both. Rammed on Pleasure
Island while eating out Chelsea!

CORY
(after much consideration)
Butt Pirates, come and get it!

ANDERSON
That was time well spent.

EXT. HIGHWAY (SOUTHERN LANDSCAPE) - DAY

The car continues South. Odd billboards dot the landscape:
"The Blue and Grey Motel". "Stonewall's Civil War Funpark".
"Sambo's Flapjacks - Where Johnny Comes Marching Home".
Finally, there's a signpost up ahead. "Welcome to Georgia".

EXT. GLORY GLORY GAS-ELUIA FILLING STATION - LATE AFTERNOON

Not much sun left. The guys exit the car and stretch. Look
around. Nelson pumps the gas.

NELSON
Man, I am so sick of driving thru
hick towns on life support that
have morphed into Civil War tourist
attractions! The whole point was
getting away from history class.

CORY
Chill, dude. I figure if we drive
all night, we'll be quaffing brews
by four and boffing babes by five!
A MAN in torn overalls walks by and spits at the guys' feet.

OVERALL MAN
And pushing up daises by midnight...

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

Just then, a BANJO begins to play. On the front porch of
the station, a YOUNG BOY strums a familiar tune. He smiles,
his three good teeth showing. Encouraged, Nelson grabs his
guitar from the convertible and begins strumming along.
Anderson and Cory join in, CLAPPING and WHISTLING.

NELSON
Go, banjo boy, go!

SCREECH! A silver Mustang convertible, top down, skids into
the station. One lucky dude sits behind the wheel, driving
with two amazing babes. By the way they giggle and grope
each other, it's immediately clear there is some kind of
“wild thing” between the three.

NELSON
Holy...

The passenger door opens. KAT, a dark-haired, tattooed,
belt-and-buckled vixen kicks her way out and heads for the
mini-market.

NELSON
...shit.

Then it gets worse as a blonde knockout hops from the back
and stretches. This is JOEY, a self-contained packet of
both sugar and spice.

CORY
Oh, God, bro. She's perfect.

ANDERSON
(locking eyes with Joey
She's not your type, dude. Trust me.

NELSON
Hey, man. I think Anderson just
pissed on your hydrant.

Undeterred, Cory walks up to the car. RICKY, the driver,
nods. He looks like he could be one of the Backstreet Boys-
if one of them ever quit to sing lead for the Sex Pistols.

CORY
What's up, dude?

RICKY
Just, you know, a little road trip
with the ladies. Name's Ricky.

Cory ignores. Checks out Joey. She smiles.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:
JOEY
Where you guys heading?
CORY
Oh, ah... I got a buddy in Daytona
with a beach house. On the beach.
JOEY
Really. A beach house on the beach?
CORY
Yep.
JOEY
And in Daytona, no less. Must be fate,
huh, Rick?
RICKY

Must be. Cuz, we're heading there
manana. Right, Kitty Kat?

Kat's arrived with chips and sodas. She looks Cory over.

KAT
After tonight, of course, when we
violate yet another motel room.
And each other.

Kat winks. Growls. Cory swallows hard.
CORY

Cool. Well, ah... We should all
hook up when you guys hit town.

RICKY
Good idea. We should all hook up.
KAT
You got a number, hon?
CORY
Yeah. Sure... Um, you wouldn't
happen to have a pen... or paper?
JOEY

(eyes still fixed on Anderson)
Who needs paper?

Joey lifts her shirt to expose an incredible pierced belly.
Jaws drop. Ricky laughs as he and Kat get back in the car.

RICKY
He's done.

(CONTINUED)
10.
CONTINUED:

Anderson makes his move, marker in hand, brushing past
Cory. Joey smiles. Now THIS is more like it. Anderson
kneels down, coolly writes his number on her amazing abs.

JOEY
You didn't tell me your name.
CORY
(flustered)
Corndog. I mean... Cory.

Wasn't talking to him. Joey stares down at Anderson.

ANDERSON
Anderson.

JOEY
Whenever you're finished...

He is, but it's just so great down there.

JOEY
...Anderson.

He finally stands. Joey gets into the car with the others.

ANDERSON
What about your name?
JOEY
I'll tell you... if I call.
RICKY

Later, Corndog.

Ricky guns the engine. The Mustang takes off.

NELSON

Was that a score? I can't really say.
CORY

She'll call... She wants the house.

Anderson smirks, tosses Nelson the keys. Notes Overall Man
leering, munching on a shoefly scraped off the dashboard.

ANDERSON
We're in deliverance country now,
Nelson, so unless you're into
squealing like Porky Pig's love
bitch, none of your short cuts!

(CONTINUED)
11.
CONTINUED:

NELSON
You know, you guys have no faith.

The three pile into the convertible and head off, coating
Banjo Boy with dust as he continues his tune undaunted.
Overall Man chews. Cackles.

OVERALL MAN
...and pushing up daisies by midnight!

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. HIGHWAY (SOUTHERN LANDSCAPE) - NIGHT

The full moon looms in the midnight sky, lording over all.

INT/EXT. ANDERSON'S CONVERTIBLE (DRIVING) - NIGHT

Nelson tries to keep his eyes open. The other guys are out
cold. He fumbles with the RADIO. Nothing but Southern
preachers and bad country music. A weird song about how
"The South is Gonna Rise Again".

NELSON
Hey, Corndog? What's "quaffing"?

No response. His eyelids lower.

NELSON
Is that Latin or something?

KAPOW!! Tire blowout! The car veers left. Right. Stops.
NELSON
Shit!
EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT
Dark. Desolate. Nelson kneels before the shredded tire.

NELSON
Uh, fellas. A little help here.

From inside the convertible, Anderson and Cory stir,

kicking over their empty beer bottles. The only sound to be
heard... other than the mournful HOWLING OF WILD COYOTES!
Flustered, Nelson begins to rock the car back and forth.

NELSON
Yoo hoo! Oh, boys!!!!!

(CONTINUED)
12.
CONTINUED:

Nelson stops shaking the car. SILENCE. Then FOOTSTEPS.
NELSON
Sorry to disturb your sorry ass,
Corndog, but I could really use...
Nelson looks up from his kneeling position. Overall Man
stands directly above, his frothing mouth fixed in a twisted
grin! His hands clutch the banjo, held high like a club.

OVERALL MAN
It's midnight!

THWACK! Overall Man brings the banjo down hard, cracking
Nelson's head against the hubcap. Nelson crumples back onto
the road, brains spilling from his shattered skull...
INT/EXT. ANDERSON'S CONVERTIBLE (DRIVING) - NIGHT

Nelson wakes with a start from what has been his NIGHTMARE.
Up ahead, a flaming torch burns brightly, illuminating a
wooden sign smack dab in the middle of the road. He slams
on the brakes, nearly hitting this crudely painted DETOUR
SIGN. A large arrow points to a dirt clearing on the right.
Nelson sits at the wheel. Catches his breath. The guys have
not even stirred. With little choice, Nelson follows the
sign's directions, turning off the freeway onto the path.
EXT. DIRT ROAD - NIGHT

Nelson navigates the convertible along the very narrow,
very dark dirt road.

NELSON
Think we should turn around?

He looks at his two buddies. Dead drunk.

INT/EXT. ANDERSON'S CONVERTIBLE (DRIVING) - NIGHT
Nelson drives a few more yards. Wipes his eyes.

NELSON
Way to stay up with me, guys.

Too tired to continue, Nelson pulls over, done for the night.

DISSOLVE TO:
13.

EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

The convertible rests on the side of the road.

INT. ANDERSON'S CONVERTIBLE - DAY

The guys are fast asleep. Anderson is the first to wake. He
shoves Nelson, who rouses with a FART.

NELSON
Wassup...?

ANDERSON
Why do I have a feeling we're not
on the highway anymore?

From behind, Cory stirs, oblivious to the morning wood
saying "hello" through his baggy shorts.

CORY
Don't even tell me you took one of
your friggin' short cuts!

NELSON
Chill out, Pinocchio. There was a
detour sign pointing this way, okay?

ANDERSON
Detour sign?

NELSON
Hey, man, I tried to wake your ass.
It's your fault, too. Kind of...

ANDERSON
My fault?

NELSON
Yeah, your fault! If you hadn't
said shit about being Porky Pig's
love bitch, I would'a never had
this frigging nightmare...

CORY
Let me get this. You had a bad
dream, and that's why we're here?

NELSON
Yeah. No... It was the detour sign!
Look, I got killed in that dream.
That is not supposed to happen.

(CONTINUED)
14.
CONTINUED:

CORY
Whatever.

NELSON
I only drove a couple miles, anyway.

Anderson spots something in the distance.
ANDERSON

Looks like there's a town up ahead.

Let's grab some chow and figure out

where the hell we are.
EXT. COUNTRY ROAD- DAY
The convertible drives down the road, passing a road sign
bearing the legend "You are now entering Pleasant Valley".
EXT. PLEASANT VALLEY TOWN SQUARE - DAY
Looks like a county fair is in progress. Hundreds of
SOUTHERNERS of all ages fill the area; eating pie, roasting
corn and dancing square. Confederate flags abound.

INT. ANDERSON'S CONVERTIBLE (MOVING) - DAY

Top down, the convertible rolls under a banner proclaiming
"Pleasant Valley. Population 2001".

CORY
Must be a holiday.

NELSON
Is today Passover or something?

ANDERSON
You truly are a moron, Nelson.
EXT. PLEASANT VALLEY TOWN SQUARE - DAY
Flanked by two STROLLING MINSTRELS, an official-looking,
goateed gentleman walks over to the car. A black patch
emblazoned with the confederate flag covers his left eye.

MAYOR GEORGE W. BUCKMAN.

MAYOR BUCKMAN
Welcome to Pleasant Valley!

The guys take in the scene, unsure what to think.

(CONTINUED)
15.
CONTINUED:

MAYOR BUCKMAN
Don't be a wet ding dong, fellas!
Buckman's the name. Mayor's my
game! Now why don't y'all give us
a Howdy Doo?

Buckman holds out his hand, hospitable and friendly-like.
The guys shrug. Step out of the car. Why not...

ANDERSON
Anderson Lee. Nice to meet you, sir.
My two buds here go by...

Eager townsfolk swarm the trio, shaking hands, patting backs.

MAYOR BUCKMAN
Anderson Lee! What a beautiful surname!
Ya ain't from the south, are ya?

ANDERSON
(slips into Southern accent)
Born and bred, sir. Lived in South
Carolina till Freshman year...

MAYOR BUCKMAN
But ya moved to the other side, I see!
Well, ya might be savable yet. Ya see,
you and your compatriots have arrived
just in time to be this year's Guests
of Honor!

An OVATION greets the news.

MAYOR BUCKMAN
And lookie here, looks like we've
got more honored guests fresh on
the way!

The silver Mustang, top down, pulls into town. Ricky, Joey
and Kat trade looks with our threesome, equally confused.

RICKY
Is this some hillbilly reality
show type thing?

MAYOR BUCKMAN
Friends, for the next two days it's
gonna be one big party! Nothing but
dancing, games, a good old fashioned
barrel roll... and best of all, our
world famous barbecue!

EXPLOSION of cheering.

16.

NELSON
(low, to his buds)
I say we get the hell out of Dodge.
These people are freaks.

CORY
Well that sure is freaky in all the
right places!

Cory points out a young girl sucking a lollipop. Pure
Southern jailbait in tank top and cutoffs, she stands
behind a wooden stall: The "John Wilkes Kissing Booth".
Prancing over, she removes her lolli and smiles...
revealing the worse set of choppers ever seen by man!

PEACHES
Hey, studs!

Jailbait, er, PEACHES, leans on the hood, flashing her
perky cleavage. Cory is hooked, buckteeth and all.

PEACHES
You're kinda cute.

CORY
Um, hi.....

ANDERSON
Easy, Corndog. Fourteen'll get you
twenty.

NELSON

In what? Dental prison?
Mayor Buckman puts his arm around Peaches.
MAYOR BUCKMAN
Like I said, boys, all ya needs gonna
be met. Ain't that right, Peaches?!

The Mustang gang walks over to the boys. Joey picks out
Anderson with her deadly smile.

JOEY
Hey, I'm game for anything.

KAT
We've done crazier.

ANDERSON

(staring at Joey)
We'll stay if you guys stay.

(CONTINUED)
17.
CONTINUED:

Joey grins. Nods affirmative. The Mayor steps in.

MAYOR BUCKMAN
Then it's settled! Let's show our
guests some Southern hospitality!

From the distance, a ROAR is heard. Everyone looks towards
an approaching plume of DUST. It's a MOTORCYCLE, heading
for town. All eyes upon them, the bike's leather clad
riders come to a stop, then slowly remove their helmets.
The driver, MALCOLM, is black. LEAH, his partner, is Asian.
The townsfolk GASP.

MALCOLM
What the hell kinda detour is this?

Stunned silence. Finally, Mayor Buckman regains composure.

MAYOR BUCKMAN
Judas priest! If we ain't got us
two more Yanks for the Festival!
And a Negra and a Chinaman to boot!

MALCOLM
Easy with the ethnic slander,
Cracker Joe!

Leah shakes loose her long, flowing black hair.

LEAH
And that's Chinawoman.

MAYOR BUCKMAN
And what a woman! Well don't just
stand around folks! We got rooms at
Granny's fixing to wait for you!

The silence turns to CHEERING as the Minstrels begin to
play. The townsfolk envelop the guests, carrying them to
the hotel like conquering heroes. Everyone, Malcolm and
Leah included, has little choice but to go with the flow.

INT. GRANNY BOONE'S HOTEL / MAIN HALL - DAY
The eight guests enter an old fashioned, cozy hotel.
Things are looking up. Counters overflow with tasty
Southern treats; fried chicken, peach cobbler, watermelon.
A black, BUG-EYED BUSBOY offers Malcolm a big, juicy slice.
MALCOLM
I don't think so, Amos.

Two absolutely gorgeous girls, HESTER and GLENDORA, walk
over to Anderson, Nelson and Cory. They could be twins.

HESTER
I'm Hester, and this is Glendora.
CORY
Corndog.
The girls giggle.
CORY

I mean Cory. Dammit!

GLENDORA
Granny Boone says we're 'sposed to
show you to your rooms, Corncob!

ANDERSON
Make sure you show "Corncob" the bed.

The girls giggle again.

CORY
They actually think you're funny.

ANDERSON
Guess you just have to be a Southern
intellectual to get my humor.

EXT. ROOSTER COCK SALOON - DAY

A strange sign adorns the rickety old drinkin' place.

INT. ROOSTER COCK SALOON - DAY

Mayor Buckman paces behind the bar. RUFUS and LESTER, his
hillbilly sons, sit dutifully before him, both young and
hunky, both dumb as door nails. Besides Lester lies
JEZEBEL, his large, loyal, shabby sheep.

MAYOR BUCKMAN
Now boys, I don't know how in the
hell you let those two devils in...

RUFUS
It was Lester's fault, daddy. He
done forgot to take down the Detour
sign after that fine automobile
with them titty bitties went by!

MAYOR BUCKMAN
Jesus Christ on a cracker!

LESTER
Oh, daddy, please don't hate me
none! I was so worked up when I saw
those titties, bouncing up and
down, jiggling left and right...

MAYOR BUCKMAN
All right, all right. Save it for
your spanking, son! Lord knows I
don't cater to waitin' on a darkie
and a yella, but in service of the
Festival...

He looks at an old, wooden cross on the wall and nods to
it, clasping his hands in prayer.

MAYOR BUCKMAN
Well, it'll all be over soon.

RUFUS
Looks like Miss Peaches snagged one
of them Yankee boys already!

LESTER
I got my eye on that perty one with
them legs leading up to them tender
buttocks!

MAYOR BUCKMAN
Leave her to Harper, boy. That tasty
dish ain't got a fightin' chance once
he walks up on her. Am I right or am
I right?

RUFUS/LESTER
You're right, Daddy!

MAYOR BUCKMAN
Good. Now, let's commence to hostin'.
EXT. GRANNY BOONE'S HOTEL - DAY
The Strolling Minstrels sing their song below the Mustang

Gang's window, a woeful BALLAD about runaway slaves, horses
dying and the Civil War.
20.

INT. MUSTANG TRIO'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

Joey stares out the window listening to the tune. Behind
her, Kat and Ricky check out the room's three single beds.

JOEY
Jesus Christ, is this the biggest
goof ever or what?

KAT
The welcoming committee, or that
these hicks actually think we're
gonna sleep in separate beds?

RICKY
Talk about Southern discomfort...

Kat and Ricky push their two beds together (They've done
this before). Kat grabs Ricky's crotch and pulls him close
for a wet kiss. Joey watches amused as Ricky gropes Kat's
ass, drawing her in to their erotic embrace.

KAT
I say we hang out, grab whatever we
can, and then blow.

RICKY
The whole town? Or just those frat boys?

KAT
Don't worry, Ricky. I'll save one
for you.
Hmmm... Just then, a KNOCK. Kat breaks free and opens the

door to find a well stocked, handsome young man. His hair
is slicked back. Looks like he's tried to dress for the
occasion. This is HARPER ALEXANDER, Pleasant Valley's very
own Clark Gable. He clears his throat.

HARPER
On behalf of our little town, I'm
here to welcome ya and invite ya to
take in some of our sights.

RICKY
(under his breath)
I'll wrestle you for him...

HARPER
What's that?

KAT
Nothing. Just ignore him.

She grabs hold of his arm.

KAT
Dang, you've got some muscles there,
Jethro!
HARPER

It's Harper, Ma'am. Harper Alexander.

KAT
I'm Kat. Just Kat. As in pussy...
This is Joey and Ricky.

Harper extends a hand to Ricky who attempts a rocker
handshake, much to Harper's stone faced bewilderment.

RICKY
What's up, stud? Want to show me
around this place?

Harper lets Ricky's hand go.

HARPER
Actually, if Miss Pussy Kat is
willing, the sun sure looks mighty
nice reflectin' on the lake right
"bout now...

KAT
Miss Pussy Kat is more than willing.

HARPER
Well then, I guess I'll be seeing you
other fine folks at the Festival.

JOEY
Don't do anything we wouldn't do.

Kat exits with Harper. The door shuts. Ricky ponders.
RICKY
Is there anything we wouldn't do?
INT. MALCOLM AND LEAH'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY
Leah watches amused as Malcolm draws devil horns on a framed
portrait of a beaming Robert E. Lee. Catching them red-

ce and fall on the bed, white sheets and all.

Y BOONE'S HOTEL / FRONT PORCH - DAY

Cory and Nelson relax in wooden chairs as Hester,
nd Peaches respectively cool them off with fans.

NELSON
I ever tell you guys how much I
love Civil War tourist attractions?

CORY
Well, I say to hell with Daytona.

ANDERSON
(slight Southern accent
I, sir, am in accordance.

CORY
You know, dude, I never knew you
were Southern.

ANDERSON
I never told you? I was raised by my
Aunt Charlotte. She was old school
Southern. Very dignified. Taught me
to open doors for the ladies and say,
"Yes, ma'am. Why, no, Ma'am."

NELSON
You sure un-learned that shit fast!

over and hi-fives.

ANDERSON
It's still in me. In the background.
24,

EXT. PLEASANT VALLEY TOWN SQUARE/CHURCH/OAK TREE — DAY

Kat and Harper stroll arm in arm through town, where time
truly seems to have stood still. The Ice Cream Parlor..
The Barber Shop... The Whore House (Yep)!

TOWNSFOLK pause to wave hello (The BLACKSMITH and BUTCHER
among them), all sunshine and smiles.

KAT
Feels like I'm at Disneyland or
something.
HARPER

Now, Miss Pussy Kat, you know this
is Georgia.

KAT
Everyone's so damn polite and
smiley. What's up with that?
Someone put Prozac in the water?

HARPER
Well, gosh, Miss Pussy...

KAT
Harper, just try calling me Kat.
Miss Pussy sounds so formal.

HARPER
Well... Kat... I can't speak for my
good neighbors, but speaking for
myself, how could one not but smile
whilst in the company of a
beautiful Northern sophistocrat
like yourself.

Kat let's go of Harper's arm and turns to face him.

KAT
You're either the most romantic guy
I've ever met, or you're completely
full of shit!

With that, Kat throws herself on Harper, planting a big wet
one smack dab on his face. Dumbfounded, Harper takes her
hand and walks on...
25.

EXT. GRANNY BOONE'S HOTEL / FRONT PORCH - DAY

Lester marches to and fro out on the street, proudly piping
"When Johnny Comes Marching Home" on his wooden flute.
Jezebel struts behind him, dressed in Rebel military garb,
complete with a tiny holster and pop gun. Atop her head rests
a confederate hat, worn at a jaunty angle.

From the porch, Anderson rises and salutes.

ANDERSON
As you were, private!

Lester salutes back as he passes, visibly moved.

LESTER
Thank you, sir!

The girls giggle up a storm. From behind the girls' fans,
GRANNY BOONE suddenly appears, magically, as if from thin
air. Gray-haired and bespectacled, full tray of beverages
in tow, Granny is the archetypal Southern matron, save for
the mangy coonskin cap perpetually perched atop her head.

GRANNY BOONE
Anyone for fresh lemonade?

The boys rise, a bit startled, yet forthcoming in manners
nonetheless.

ANDERSON
Don't tell me. You must be Miss Boone!

NELSON
Miss Boone, from the bottom of our
hearts, we thank you for such fine
accommodations!

GRANNY
Now, don't make me blush! And
that's Granny to you, sonny boy.

Just then, a loud SCREECH interrupts the pleasantries. A
CALICO CAT scurries across the porch, followed by a
scruffy, freckled twelve year old. This is HUCKLEBILLY.

HUCKLEBILLY
Goshdangit! She's getting away!

The guys join Hucklebilly in pursuit of the cat, a chase
which leads around back...
26.

EXT. CHURCH - DAY

Kat and Harper stand before an old oak tree near a tiny
church, a vision right out of "Gone With the Wind".
Harper surveys the scenery, lost in reverie.

HARPER
My daddy proposed to my momma right
here on this spot.

KAT
My daddy proposed to my mom in the
back of a '69 Chevy.

Harper remains absent in his thoughts. Kat fiddles with his
belt, undoing the buckle.

HARPER
Of course, that was before the
troubles. Before all that fire
done burnt this spot to the ground.

Kat reaches down into Harper's pants.

KAT
Oh, I can feel that fire now...

HARPER
Life always finds a way to push
itself up through death, Miss Kat.

KAT
Feels like something else trying to
push its way through now, baby...

Kat strokes Harper down below. He finally responds
flashing a killer smile, placing his hands on her backside.
She swoons as he slides down her shorts, exposing a winged
unicorn tattooed on her butt.
HARPER
Ya like horses?

EXT. GRANNY BOONE'S HOTEL / BACKYARD - DAY

Anderson, Cory and Nelson form a gauntlet as Hucklebilly
approaches his cornered cat, hovering in the corner.

HUCKLEBILLY
Here, kitty kitty...

(CONTINUED)
27.
CONTINUED:

Hucklebilly charges, falling flat on his face. The cat
breaks for freedom, but Anderson is quicker. He dives,
sideways, carefully scooping up the frightened feline.

NELSON
(mock sports announcer)
Anderson Lee, once again proving
why he's Northern-U's number one
goalie...

Cory cheers as Anderson hands the cat off to Hucklebilly.
The kid flexes his arm.

HUCKLEBILLY
I think I broke my elby bone.
ANDERSON
Nah, you'll be fine, bro. Just walk
it off.
HUCKLEBILLY

Thanks, Mister. Name's Hucklebilly.

CORY
What's up, Huckleberry.

HUCKLEBILLY
It's Hucklebilly, dumb ass.

NELSON
Damn. Feisty little fella.

HUCKLEBILLY
Y'all wanna play a game with me?

ANDERSON
I don't know, Hucklebilly, we kinda
got some young ladies waiting for us
out front, if you know what I mean.

HUCKLEBILLY
Oh, the heck with it then....

Little Hucklebilly turns and walks away, about to cry.
Awww...

ANDERSON
Okay. You win. Whaddya got in mind?

The boy turns, grinning. In his right hand he holds kitty
by the scruff of her neck. In the other, a small noose.

(CONTINUED)
28.
CONTINUED:

HUCKLEBILLY
It's called "Kill the Kitty"
See, kitty's been bad. Real bad.
And I'm gonna lynch her. Y'all
can be the witnesses...

ANDERSON
Whoa... whoa... Wait a second!
Now what would your mother think
if you hurt that poor little kitty?

HUCKLEBILLY
My momma? Mister, my momma gives
me a silver dollar for every broke
necked pussy I bring home!

The guys (and the cat) look at each other in disbelief.

INT. HORSE BARN - DUSK

The barn door busts open. Harper enters with Kat, pulling
her by the hand to a pile of hay on which they tumble.
HORSES WHINNY and NAY as the two roll around and make out.

KAT
Make me scream that rebel yell!

HARPER
Now that I can guarantee. In fact..

A man inspired, Harper gets up and starts tinkering around
the barn. Kat makes herself comfortable in the hay.

HARPER
...you just lie right there!

KAT
Whatever you say, lover man.

Harper finally returns. He bends down next to Kat and
begins gingerly tying a TWINE ROPE around her left hand.

KAT
I didn't know my southern gentleman
had a touch of kink in him.
Harper ties another rope around Kat's right hand.
HARPER

Well if kink means a hunger for you,
ma'am, than that he does.

(CONTINUED)
29.
CONTINUED:

More rope goes around Kat's left ankle.

HARPER
Now, I know you city folk think
us country boys naive in the ways
of love...

And now the last bit of rope goes around her right ankle.

HARPER
...but we ain't as innocent as you
might think.

Harper stands to admire his handiwork. Kat is completely
tied up, her legs and arms spread-eagled. For the first
time, she realizes that the other ends of the ropes are
fastened to the saddles of four very restless HORSES. The
animals move forward, lifting Kat into the air as the ropes
are pulled taut.

KAT
Uh, Harper... This isn't exactly
what I had in mind, baby.
HARPER
Frankly, Miss Pussy, I don't give

a damn.

With that, Harper pulls an antique pistol from his
waistband. BAM! Startled, the horses gallop off in four
opposite directions, taking with them Kat's arms and legs
which are violently torn from their lengthened sockets!!!

HARPER
Yee haw!

Having been lifted in the air by the ropes, Kat's severed
torso now lands with a THUD, shock forever etched on her
blood gushing mouth.

EXT. HORSE BARN - DUSK

The horses gallop through the rustic landscape, Kat's
severed limbs dragging behind them. Off in the distance,
the CLANG of a dinner triangle can be heard, Granny Boone's
shrill call for supper.

GRANNY BOONE (OS)
Come and get it! Come and get it!
30.

INT. GRANNY BOONE'S HOTEL / MAIN HALL - NIGHT

Everyone sits around a large table at places especially set
for them. Anderson... Cory... Nelson... Joey... Ricky...
Malcolm... Leah... Yet no sign of Kat, just an empty chair.
Mayor Buckman and his sons, sit among the guests, as do
Hester and Glendora. At the head of the table, Granny Boone
holds court, proud of the bountiful feast her guests now
devour amid SMALL TALK.

GRANNY
I know it's not etiquette to eat
without everyone present, but a
little birdie advised me your perky
friend might just be a bit tardy.

MAYOR BUCKMAN
Ain't that the truth. Harper Alexander
done gone and swept her off her feet!

RICKY
Lucky bitch.

Granny hurls a hot biscuit, nailing Ricky in the head.

GRANNY
Young man, guest or no guest, I will
not tolerate swearing at my table!

JOEY
Please forgive Ricky, Miss Boone.
Jealousy often gets in the way of
his manners.

CORY
Jealousy?

RICKY
Dude, Kat always bags the fine boys
first. Just once I wish she was the
one eating sloppy seconds.

Mayor Buckman chokes on his food. So does Malcolm, who
tastes something strange in his meat.

MALCOLM
Not to change the subject, but what
kind of barbecue we eating anyways?
GRANNY
Rump roast. An old family recipe.

(CONTINUED)
31.
CONTINUED:

Ricky turns over his meat with his fork. What looks like
the tattoo of a winged unicorn can clearly be seen. Ricky,
however, doesn't notice, swallowing it whole.

GRANNY
Well there's certainly more where
that came from! Now who wants some
elderberry wine?

A round of raised hands and laughter greet Granny's query.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. GRANNY BOONE'S HOTEL / MAIN HALL - NIGHT

Later... The wine has kicked in and loosened tongues.
Granny Boone plays the piano while Hester and Glendora do a
slow dance for a grateful Cory and Nelson, who rest in easy
chairs chowing down pecan pie.

A buxom waitress (let's call her the MILK MAIDEN) saunters
over with two extra large pitchers of whole milk. She
flashes Nelson a big grin, careful to give him a view of
her considerable endowments.

MILK MAIDEN
May I offer you some fresh milk
with your pie?

NELSON
Um... I think you just did.
Nelson turns to Cory.
NELSON/CORY

(in unison)
Holy mother of God!
EXT. GRANNY BOONE'S HOTEL / FRONT PORCH - NIGHT

Joey relaxes on the porch swing, sipping wine. Anderson
approaches, obviously soused.

ANDERSON
Thought I'd give you an address to
go along with that phone number.

Joey turns, smiles and slowly lifts up her shirt exposing
that luscious, pierced belly. Yum.

(CONTINUED)
32.
CONTINUED:

JOEY
You got a pen?

Anderson grins. Holds up his trusty magic marker.

ANDERSON
Former Cub Scout. Third class.
Always come prepared!

JOEY
Well, you're certainly good at
pitching a tent.

He looks down. Sure enough. With that, Anderson eases Joey
back onto the swing and the two lock lips. He begins softly
writing on her belly. Lower.. Lower.. Squirming.. Moaning..

INT. GRANNY BOONE'S HOTEL / KITCHEN - NIGHT

Mayor Buckman forms a huddle with Rufus and Lester.
Hucklebilly sits on the counter wearing oven mitts and
covered in cat scratches. Jezebel lies on the floor.

MAYOR BUCKMAN
Sons, as you know, Harper done did
his part with that Yankee philly.
Time's now come for you to do yours.

Just then, Lester notices Hucklebilly working on a much
larger noose than usual.

LESTER
That's a mighty big noose for a
cat, Hucklebilly!

HUCKLEBILLY
Who said it's for a cat, hotlips?

LESTER
Why, if you even think of harming
one feather on Jezebel's head...

MAYOR BUCKMAN
Lester, shut your mouth! You know,
I've been meaning to talk to you
about Jizzabel anyway. I mean, damn,
boy. This thing is gettin' out of
hand. It's unnatural, is what it is.

LESTER
Why, I'm insulted, Daddy. Surprised
by your innuendo.

(CONTINUED)
33.
CONTINUED:

MAYOR BUCKMAN
Is that thing at least a girlie?

LESTER
She's a woman to you, sir. Now,
if you'll excuse me...

INT. GRANNY BOONE'S HOTEL / MAIN HALL - NIGHT

Malcolm, Leah and Ricky sit at the table, dealing cards and
tossing back shots. Lester darts by, followed by Jezebel.
Then... the Milk Maiden, followed by Nelson.

MALCOLM
I must say. There's nothing quite as
determined as a sheep on a mission.

LEAH
Or a horny frat boy.

RICKY
Know what I always say? Only
difference between a frat boy and
a gay boy is a six pack of beer.

Leah laughs, clinking her shot glass with Ricky's. As she
does so, Malcolm catches Ricky checking out Leah's ample
assets (not that Ricky is being all that sly about it).

MALCOLM
Brother, you need to pick sides!

Ricky smiles and shrugs. What can he say? Now they all
laugh and throw back a shot.

MALCOLM
Damn, I bet Robert E. Lee would shit
in his muthafuckin' grave if he could
see us three: The united colors of
Bennetton. Black, yellow... and pink!

INT. GRANNY BOONE'S HOTEL / KITCHEN - NIGHT
Still stunned, Buckman attempts to regain his composure.
MAYOR BUCKMAN
Remind me to shoot the Blacksmith,

please, cuz you and your brother sure
as shit didn't spring from my loins!

(CONTINUED)
34.
CONTINUED:

RUFUS
I will, Daddy.

MAYOR BUCKMAN
And you tell Lester one of you's
gotta fall in with that sissy boy.
I know it goes against the Lord...

Rufus leaps to his feet. Happy to help. Way too happy.

RUFUS
Let me do it, Daddy!

Buckman grimaces. Slaps Rufus with his hat.

MAYOR BUCKMAN
Goddammit, Rufus! That ain't
nothin' to get excited about!

Granny Boone walks in carrying an empty tray.

GRANNY
What's with all this hollerin'?

MAYOR BUCKMAN
Oh, nuthin' but my boy clamorin' for
more of them tasty treats of yours!

GRANNY
Aw, you fellas gonna make me blush!
Well, go on, Hucklebilly, show 'em
what we got cookin'!

Energized, Hucklebilly opens the oven door and pulls out a
piping hot bake tin. It's a beautifully golden crusted pie-
complete with a calico cat tail poking up through the dough.

HUCKLEBILLY
One kitty crumb cake comin' up!!!

EXT. GRANNY BOONE'S HOTEL / FRONT PORCH - NIGHT

Joey leans back on the swing as Anderson goes to work.
Things are really getting hot. And then Nelson walks out.
Can you say buzz kill?

NELSON
A chick with two milk jugs walk by?

JOEY
Yeah. She was heading for the cow
pasture crying your name.

(CONTINUED)
35.
CONTINUED:

Joey gets up from the swing and gives Anderson a wink.

JOEY
Guess I'll leave you two alone.
ANDERSON
Let me know when you want my zip

code...
She walks inside, gliding past a buzzed Cory on his way out.

CORY
Gentleman, how about a toast!

NELSON
Not now. I'm thinking about "her".

CORY
Why, Nelson, I'm surprised at you.
What happened to bros before hoes?

ANDERSON
Guess that went out with the secret
handshake. Hit me, bartender.

Cory produces a bottle of Jack Daniels and three shot
glasses. They each take a glass as he pours.

ANDERSON
To friendship, and the ties that
bind. In this case, the fine folk
of Pleasant Valley.

They down their drinks and toss the glasses to the street.

ANDERSON
That was a moment.

NELSON
Dude. Tell Anderson about those jugs.

CORY
They were definitely mounds to
reckon with.

NELSON
Um, actually, I was talking about
those pitchers of white, creamy
milk she was carrying.

Cory and Anderson shoot Nelson a look.

(CONTINUED)
36.
CONTINUED:

NELSON
Okay, of course I was talking about
her tits. I mean, God! Did you see
those melons? Those ripe orbs...
(holds his hands out, squeezing)
...of nectar. Those juicy orbs...

Nelson turns. Joey stands in the doorway. Watching him.

NELSON
...of Venus. Um. Yeah. Drudge report
said the orbs of Venus are heading
towards Earth. Might even collide.

JOEY
Hey, Anderson. You still wanna play
post office?

ANDERSON
Why, yes, ma'am, I do.

Anderson grins, pats his chums on the back and dashes
inside with Joey.

NELSON
Fuck me!

CORY
I'm not that drunk.

INT. GRANNY BOONE'S HOTEL / MAIN HALL - NIGHT

Ricky sits at the dining table arm wrestling with Rufus.
Malcolm and Leah cheer them on. Cory and Nelson enter just
as Ricky wins the match. He spots them and winks.

NELSON
Christ. Even he's gonna get laid.

A giggling Hester and Glendora flank Cory from behind. The
girls hook their arms through Cory, who absolutely cannot
believe his good fortune. They lead him upstairs.

NELSON
I thought you said bros before hoes?

Nelson slumps on the steps in defeat. Trailing Cory, the
rest of the gang parades past him and up the stairs.

LEAH
Don't whack it too hard.

(CONTINUED)
37.
CONTINUED:

Over at the piano, Mayor Buckman puts his arm around Granny
Boone and smiles knowingly as she finishes up her song.

MAYOR BUCKMAN
And to all a goodnight...

GRATUITOUS SEX MONTAGE

INT. ANDERSON'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Anderson and Joey play 'post office' the way it should be
played: half-naked on a bear skin rug in front of a glowing
fireplace. They take turns writing random addresses and
phone numbers on the other's quivering flesh. Anderson uses
his magic marker, Joey her lipstick... Joey licks a postage
stamp, then places it on Anderson's chest as the two
embrace, sealing the moment.

INT. MALCOLM AND LEAH'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Malcolm and Leah playfully kick-box, an S&M duo clad in
leather underwear, biker boots and helmets. They kick, then
kiss. Kick. Kiss. And then they produce riding crops,
swatting each other, impressed by the other's prowess.
Malcolm slices Leah's halter top, which falls to the floor.
Topless, she leaps onto Malcolm, knocking him to the bed...

INT. CORY'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Cory sits on one side of the bed while Hester and Glendora
sit on the other. Hester undresses Glendora. Glendora
undresses Hester. Cory undresses himself. And then the two
girls begin making out! His dream come true, Cory dives
in... only to be pushed away! Excitement turns to lament as
it quickly becomes apparent his services are not required.

INT. MUSTANG TRIO'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

A confederate flag draped over his naked form, Ricky kicks
back with a glass of wine, nodding in approval as Rufus
shyly undresses before him. Off with his right boot. Off
with the left. And then off with the overalls. Ricky chokes
on his wine, grabbing the bottle for another swig. This
"Abner" sure ain't little!
38.

INT. NELSON'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Nelson lies in his bed flogging the bishop. His solo bliss
is jolted by a rock smashing through the window. Boxer
briefs caught round his ankles, he opens the blinds.

EXT. GRANNY BOONE'S HOTEL / BACKYARD - NIGHT

YESSSS! Hiding behind a bush is none other than the ultra
vixen Milk Maiden, dressed to kill in a garter and bustier.

MILK MAIDEN
Surprise!

NELSON
You have no idea how glad I am
that you're here, ma'am. I've
been thinking about you all night!

The Milk Maiden giggles and points. Nelson looks down at
his bulging boxers... Whoops!

INT. NELSON'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Turning from the window, Nelson hikes up his boxers. Tosses
his Kleenex into the trash. Frantic.

MILK MAIDEN (OS)
You gonna invite me in? Or just
stand there playing with yourself?

NELSON
Hell, yeah I'm gonna invite you in...

Now "decent", Nelson turns to find the Milk Maiden standing
directly behind him! (How the hell she get there so fast?!)
She cradles a milk jug to her bosom, as well as a long tube
and funnel. Nelson is mesmerized.

NELSON
Got milk? Heh heh...

The Milk Maiden smiles. Pushes Nelson down on the bed,
straddling his waist. Begins untying her satin bustier.

NELSON
I know. Bad joke. "Got milk?"
Like you've never heard that one

before...

(CONTINUED)
39.
CONTINUED:

The bustier falls to the floor. She's half naked. WOW!
Nelson ogles her voluptuous breasts as she slowly begins to
caress them.

NELSON
So, ah. You want to get to know
each other a little bit maybe...?

She shakes her head, brings the rubber tube to her mouth
and licks the end, never once taking her eyes off Nelson's.

NELSON
Okay... That's cool. I love milk.
Always have. Mom never had to say
to me, "Drink up your milk, poopy"

Super vixen undulates her hips, grinding into his crotch.

NELSON
Um. My mom used to call me "poopy".
Long story.

MILK MAIDEN
Honey, you want to talk? Or have
a little fun?

She now places the milk jug on his chest. Nelson can barely
keep from busting a nut.

NELSON
Ah... Have some fun?

MILK MAIDEN
That's what I thought.

With that, the Milk Maiden shoves the end of the rubber
tube into his mouth. He spits it out.

NELSON
Whoa, what's that? A milk bong?

MILK MAIDEN
Silly, boy. This is special moonshine I
made just for you. You gonna suck it?

NELSON
Look, moonshine's not really my...

Nelson mumbles in protest but the Maiden is hard to resist.
She shoves the tube further down his throat, licking her lips.

MILK MAIDEN
Are you a boy... Or a man?

(CONTINUED)
40.
CONTINUED:

NELSON
(muffled)
Man, Goddammit!

MILK MAIDEN
Then suck, Mister Man!!!

NELSON
(muffled)
Fuck it! Whatever you say!
Milk me, baby!

Faced with the challenge, Nelson musters his strength and
sucks the tube with all his might. As the liquid makes its
way into his mouth, his eyes begin to bulge. Something is
not right! He tries to shake off the tube, but the Milk
Maiden only pushes it down his throat further, laughing.

Nelson thrashes about as his throat and chest begin to
bubble from the inside out. The flesh melts, exposing his
innards. Eventually, Nelson's gyrations come to a halt. The
Milk Maiden holds the jug up to his lifeless eyes.

The childish scrawl on the label spells "ACID".

MILK MAIDEN
I just hate a fella who can't hold
his liquor.

EXT. GRANNY BOONE'S HOTEL - DAY

Sitting on the front porch, The Strolling Minstrels perform
"The South is Gonna Rise Again" with gleeful vigor.

STROLLING MINSTRELS

Yeeeeee Haaaaaw! Oh, yes, the
South is surely gonna rise again!

INT. GRANNY BOONE'S HOTEL DINING ROOM - DAY

Malcolm and Leah are seated by the Bug-Eyed Busboy at an
empty table prepared for the 'Guests of Honor'. Granny
hustles about, smiling and making sure everything is "just

minstrels to play some Snoop Dogg?

The Busboy walks off, shaking his head. Malcolm looks

MALCOLM
Damn!

AT THE STAIRCASE

Anderson and Joey walk down the stairs, arm in arm. Granny
erupts in APPLAUSE. The two cringe at the over enthusiasm.

AT THE TABLE
Joey and Anderson sit down. They've definitely bonded.
MALCOLM

Looks like Cupid's arrow hit
somebody in the ass last night!

JOEY
Never knew Connecticut had so many
zip codes.
MALCOLM
Damn!

Everyone looks at Malcolm, who has spotted...
AT THE STAIRCASE

Cory arriving with Hester and Glendora. Flashing a shit
eating grin (to hide his pain), he pats the girls on the
rear, then joins everyone at the table.

AT THE TABLE
Cory grabs a platter heaped with food.

MALCOLM
I guess every dog does have his day.

CORY
You know, it's really hard to
comprehend Southern hospitality
until you've experienced it.

MAYOR BUCKMAN

Mayor Buckman enters from the kitchen with his usual
fanfare, arm around a perky Peaches. Granny Boone smiles at
him lovingly.

MAYOR BUCKMAN
I reckon y'all are in store for
more hospitality than you'll know
what to do with! Ain't that right,
Miss Peaches?

Peaches nods. Giggles.

PEACHES
That's right. I'll supply the
peaches, if you boys supply the
cream!

INT. MALCOLM AND LEAH'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

Empty room. The door opens. Little Hucklebilly sneaks
inside carrying a burlap sack. On tip toes, he snoops
around. The night stand. The dresser. The drawers. BINGO!
He removes a cell phone and pager, dumps them in the sack.

INT. GRANNY BOONE'S HOTEL DINING ROOM - DAY

Ricky enters with Rufus. They exchange a quick look as
Rufus quickly sneaks past Buckman into the kitchen. Buckman
can't help but notice his son is walking kinda funny. He
follows him inside.

MALCOLM
Damn!

ANDERSON
Looks like Cupid's arrow truly did
hit someone in the ass...
WHACK! Granny slams Anderson's hand with a serving spoon.

GRANNY BOONE
Dear Lord, the language!

Ricky sits down. Cory stops munching bacon just long enough
to ask a question.

CORY
Anybody seen Nelson or Kat?

RICKY
Now that you mention it...

(CONTINUED)
43.

JOEY
You don't think they...

Harper Alexander enters from outside, walks over and takes
a seat. Peaches promptly sits besides him.

HARPER
G'day, friends. Honored to see you
all again.

RICKY
So what did you do with Kitty Kat,
big guy?

HARPER

Why I didn't get to do anything,
Mister. That big, rough and tumble
Connecticut boy stole her from me!

ANDERSON
Nelson?!?!
CORY
No way!
HARPER

Sure enough. I was doing my best to
court her proper, but that boy just
cut right in.

Harper locks eyes with Anderson.

HARPER
You really should try the blood
sausage. Granny ground up a brand
new heap just for you.

Harper gobbles a large, bloody link, then washes it down
with Anderson's glass of milk. Everyone watches, aghast.

INT. MALCOLM AND LEAH'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

Hucklebilly searches the closet. Finding Malcolm's leather
jacket, he rifles through the pockets, grabs the keys. He
turns to leave when he hears a COMMOTION from down the hall.
Sack in tow, he slides under the bed as the whole gang enters.

CORY
Think there's an honor bar in here?

MALCOLM
Sure. Right next to the cable remote.

Malcolm pulls out a bag of weed and tosses it to Leah.
Everyone settles in as she fires up a joint, draws a hit,
then passes it to Joey.

LEAH
Ladies first.

Joey hands the joint to Ricky. He flips her the bird.

RICKY
This place is gonna be a trip, baked!

LEAH
Like it isn't trippy enough? What's
the deal with these people anyway?

ANDERSON
Oh, come on now. Admit it. You guys
just aren't used to old fashioned,
unspoiled, genuine Southern manners.

Malcolm takes a huge hit. Hands what's left to Cory.

JOEY
I wonder what Kat and your buddy
Nelson are up to.

ANDERSON
Nelson? He'll show. Trust me. Dude
can smell torque at two hundred yards.

By now there's a huge CLOUD growing in the room. Under the
bed, Hucklebilly winces at the strange smell. But then, a
huge smile forms over his face.

CORY
You know, we can all crash at my
bud's beach pad in Daytona. It's
on the beach.

RICKY
(winking at Cory
Sounds good for later, bro, but
for now I still say we hang out.
Explore. This place will be a gas.

JOEY
I'm sure it will, now that you've
turned a curious southern boy against
all that's right and proper!

RICKY
He wasn't bad for a beginner.

45.
CONTINUED:

There's a NOISE at the door.

MALCOLM
Bet it's that Mayor Buttcheeks freak!

Everyone GIGGLES, including Hucklebilly. They hide the weed
as Cory opens the door a CRACK. In tumbles Hester and
Glendora, caught red-handed peeking through the keyhole.

HESTER
Eww! What's that godawful stank?

The gang cracks up. Cory whisks the girls into the hall.

EXT. HALLWAY - DAY
Cory closes the door behind him.

CORY
We're burning blunts. You know.
Spleefs? Reefer?

GLENDORA
You best not be burnin' nuthin',
lest Old Man Cooch find out.

CORY
Old Man Cooch?

HESTER
He's our Fire Marshall. And veturanium.

CORY
You mean, veterinarian?

GLENDORA
No, he's a veturanium. Fixes dogs and
chickens and such, silly boy.
Cory stares dumbfounded. Then breaks into stoned laughter.

CORY
You two are so lucky you're hotties.

Now the girls giggle.

GLENDORA
That's right!

(CONTINUED)
46.
CONTINUED:

HESTER
And we're here in our official capacity
as Festival hostesses to invite you to
go 'sploring. Ever seen a kissing tree?

CORY
Uh, no.

GLENDORA
You wanna see one?

CORY
Does the Pope shit in the woods?

Huh? Whatever. The girls hold out their arms. Cory takes them
both and exits down the hall.

INT. MALCOLM AND LEAH'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

Everyone sits mesmerized (Translation: high) as Malcolm
finishes up a joke.

MALCOLM

So this dude goes to see his doctor.
Says, "Doc, something's up with my

old lady. She's acting whacked. It's
either Alzheimers or the clap." Doc
tells him, "Yo, take her for a long
drive and dump her off. If the bitch
finds her way home, don't fuck her."

The entire room roars with laughter. Under the _ bed,
Hucklebilly cracks up as well. Hearing this, Malcolm
swiftly grabs the boy by his feet and drags him out.

MALCOLM
Well, 'lookie here', to borrow from
the lexicon of our hosts.
A stoned Hucklebilly grins like a fool.

HUCKLEBILLY
My head feels kinda funny...

MALCOLM
What the hell are you doing in here?

HUCKLEBILLY

Wanted to say howdy, 'ceptin I fell
under the bed when y'all came in.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

ANDERSON
You fell... under the bed?

HUCKLEBILLY
Yep. But now, I'm feelin' kinda
hungry. Fact, I could eat an entire
goat and not share a single hoof!

JOEY
Aww, Huckleberry's got the munchies!

HUCKLEBILLY
Hucklebilly, dumb ass! Can't you
Northern folks get nuthin' right?

47.

Clutching his sack, Hucklebilly darts out of the room.

The now completely stoned group cracks up.

ANDERSON
So, "northern folks", I guess we're

here to stay just a little bit longer.

LEAH
In that case, I say we find out where
they're hiding the kegs.

EXT. GRANNY BOONE'S HOTEL - DAY
The "Guests of Honor" squint as they head out of

into the bright, hot Georgia day... Right into
crowd of TOWNSFOLK (including Rufus, Lester,

the hotel
the huge
Granny,

Harper, Peaches, the Milk Maiden) out there to greet them.

MAYOR BUCKMAN
Buttermilk pancakes! If it ain't our

honored Guests just in time to get the

Festival off to its biggest start!

MALCOLM
Shoot-stang, Gomer Pyle. Dang if
this ain't the bestest festival ever!

The crowd cracks up. Mayor Buckman, however, picks up on

the sarcasm. His face reddens.

MAYOR BUCKMAN
I wouldn't besmirch the efforts and
sincerity of our proud little town.
A great price has been paid to make
this Festival possible.

Silence.

(CONTINUED)
48.
CONTINUED:

ANDERSON
Whoa. Lighten up, dude. We're just
a little hung over. You know, hair
of the dog?

Buckman waves his arms. The requisite CHEERING erupts.

MAYOR BUCKMAN
Apology accepted! Now let's get
this thing going in grand style!
Boys over here! Girls over there!

The Crowd swarms around the guests, separating the males
from the females. Harper Alexander grabs a flattered Ricky.

HARPER
Come with me, partner. We're gonna
see what we can do about you.

RICKY
Whatever you say, rock star.

He leads Ricky off. Anderson and Malcolm shrug at each
other, blow Joey and Leah a kiss as the girls are whisked
away by the "lady folk"

EXT. BATHING BARN - DAY

Joey and Leah are hustled into a makeshift dressing area
behind a large barn. Hand sewn dresses hang on mannequins.
There are large steel tubs filled with water.

GRANNY BOONE
Now I hope you gals will allow us
to share our Southern ways.

JOEY
Do we have a choice?

GRANNY BOONE
Dearie, the good Lord has blessed
each one of us with distinct virtues.
It's your job as a lady to figure out
what they are and how to use them!

PEACHES
I got the gift of tongues! Got it
from my step-pappy, Reverend Jonas!
JOEY
We are definitely post-feminist here.

(CONTINUED)
49,
CONTINUED:

GRANNY BOONE
You are a shine rough. But under
them harsh Northern exteriors, I
suppose you gals oughta clean up
real good!

LEAH
I think that was a compliment.

GRANNY BOONE
Ladies, grab these girls some
lemonade, and let's set to soapin'.

The nubile town girls (aka BARBECUTIES) begin undressing
Joey and Leah, all coy and giggly as the work begins.

EXT. KISSING TREE MEADOW - DAY

Cory carries a picnic basket, trying to keep up with Hester
and Glendora as they skip through beautiful fields spotted
with daffodils and sunflowers. Everything feels hyper-real:
The sky is bright blue, the clouds white cotton candy, and
the two shapely rear ends in front of Cory are ripe and
ready. The boy's so horny he's practically hunched over.

EXT. HORSESHOE PIT - DAY

Harper Alexander leads the crowd of males into a large
field. Anderson, Malcolm and Ricky stand at the pit with
Harper. Ricky is totally in awe of the big, burly He-Man.

Across the yard, posted in the dirt, are two horseshoe
stakes. Two obscure furry masses rest atop each one. From the
distance, it is hard to tell exactly what these targets are.

HARPER
Ever take a turn at the shoes?

RICKY
Not since I was a kid.

HARPER
That's the thing, friend. You need to
be more practiced at the manly arts.
Huntin' and soldierin' and what not.

RICKY

And that has what to do with
pitching horseshoes?

(CONTINUED)
50.
CONTINUED:

HARPER
Horseshoes is a military game in
origin. Goes back to the old French
trappers method of gapping mink, as
they called it.

Just then, Jezebel bolts from the outhouse and runs across
the field. Lester follows in hot pursuit, hiking up his pants.
No one but the "Guests of Honor" seem to notice. Or care.

ANDERSON
Ah... You were saying?

EXT. BATHING BARN - DAY

Joey and Leah sit naked in individual tubs filled with
soapy water, hair up in buns to avoid getting soaked.
The Barbecuties, scantily clad and sexy wet, attend to
their bathing, scrubbing their backs and massaging their
shoulders. The Minstrels provide musical accompaniment.
Peaches "babbles" along in tongues.

PEACHES
Dosey doe, heifer hi, heiny ho...!

LEAH
Know, something? I think I could
actually get used to this.

JOEY
Girl, you must be buzzed out of your mind!

Just then, little Hucklebilly exits the barn, buck-ass
naked, save for his confederate cap and shit-eating grin.

HUCKLEBILLY
Rub a dub dub, who wants me in
their tub?!

The girls are amused. Granny Boone is not. She swats the boy.

GRANNY BOONE
What I tell you 'bout scaring the
lady folk with them nasty bits of
yours? Now git!

HUCKLEBILLY
Shoot, Granny! You never let me
have no fun!

Hucklebilly trots off, cap covering his privates, as the
girls laugh and splash him with their bath water.
51.

EXT. KISSING TREE MEADOW - DAY

Cory and his "double date" arrive upon a majestic oak tree.
Nailed to the trunk is a yellow ribbon. The girls giggle as
Cory sits down on the "love swing" hanging from the branches.

HESTER
Well, here we are! The place where
I got my first kiss!

GLENDORA
Me too!

HESTER
Well of course, you too! You're the
one who kissed me!

GLENDORA
Well, you are my first cousin! Who
else was gonna do it!

HESTER
That was before we learned 'bout
swappin' spit and that other stuff!

CORY
Wait a sec? You're cousins? Cool.

They ignore him, getting to the task of undressing each
other. Cory stares in disbelief as the girls begin to make
out. Finally, Hester stops what she's doing.

HESTER
Well?

CORY
Thought you'd never ask.

Cory hops over, unzips his fly and drops his drawers.

HESTER
No. The basket! You can watch from
the swing if you're quiet!

Cory tosses the girls the picnic basket and they lie down.
Now he's at a total loss. What the fuck does he do...? He
does what comes naturally, putting his hand down his boxers
and moaning loudly.

GLENDORA
(flabbergasted)
You, sir, are a pig.

(CONTINUED)
52.
CONTINUED:

CORY
What?! You're boning your cousin
and I'm a pig?

HESTER
Go away, boy.

CORY
But you said I could watch!

HESTER/GLENDORA
But you weren't quiet!

Flustered, Cory stomps off.

EXT. HORSESHOE PIT - DAY
Harper continues his tutelage. Malcolm's getting antsy.

HARPER
Gap, gentleman, refers to the part
of the mink that's not there after
the toss. Most usually the head.

Harper picks up a large metal horseshoe. Hands it to Ricky.

RICKY
Fuck!

The horseshoe has been shaved razor sharp. Harper smirks,
retrieves the shoe from a wincing Ricky and smoothly tosses
it at the first stake. A perfect throw, it embeds itself in
the target with a THUD.

MALCOLM
Lemme' try that, homeboy.

Malcolm carefully grabs a horseshoe and wings it at the
stake. His aim is way off. The townsfolk LAUGH.

MALCOLM
Yo, fuck y'all. Hood's not exactly
horse country. Damn...

Just then, Cory walks up, fucking pissed from his encounter
at the Kissing Tree.

ANDERSON
How'd you do with the honeys?

Cory ignores Anderson, glares at the pile of horseshoes.

(CONTINUED)
53.
CONTINUED:

CORY
(regarding the furry stakes
Hell's that?

RICKY
Mink or something.

HARPER
Go on. Gap it.

Cory grabs the shoes. Gulps a beer. Then...

CORY
(under his breath)
Kissin' cousins, my ass...

...breaks off three perfect strikes! Stunned silence is
followed by APPLAUSE and CHEERING.

BY THE STAKES

Harper goes over and gathers the horseshoes littered round
the target area.

HARPER
You done good, son. You done good.

Impaled on the stakes, unseen by the 'guests', are Kat and
Nelson's severed heads, both frozen in death grimaces.
Three razor sharp horseshoes cut into the back of Nelson's
battered skull.

EXT. BATHING BARN - DAY

Leah and Joey stand inside a ring of the lady townsfolk
Leah is now dressed in quintessential southern garb- powder
blue ruffled dress, bonnet, white cotton gloves, etc. Joey
remains wrapped in a towel, the center of attention.

JOEY
Don't even think about it.

LEAH
Think role-playing, babe. I know
my man's gonna want to hit this
when he sees it.

Granny Boone is encouraged by Leah's attitude.

(CONTINUED)
54.
CONTINUED:

GRANNY BOONE
Now you startin' to think like a
real lady!

Everyone CHEERS. Celebrates. And then...

RICKY (OS)
"Mama, don't let your babies grow up
to be cowboys..."

It's Ricky, warbling over by the barn, arms crossed, kinda
drunk.

LEAH
Easy, Cinderella.

Ricky saunters over.

RICKY
Well, if that ain't the pot calling
the kettle black. By the way, Joey,
that sexy frat boy's looking for you.

JOEY
It's about time.

Joey grabs her clothes from a mannequin and heads off. The
girls SIGH a collective disapproval.

JOEY
Sorry, ladies, I'd love to stay, but
in keeping with that Southern thing,
"when a fella needs his gal..."

EXT. HO-DOWN SHACK - DAY

Granny hops on up to the porch of a rustic shack. A large,
copper Liberty Bell dangles from its wooden post above.

GRANNY BOONE
Don't make no mind of her, girls!
Let the dance begin!

Granny pulls on the bell's cord. It RINGS loudly as the
Strolling Minstrels strike up a rollicking dance ditty.
The girls stomp the ground and bang their knees, twirling
decorative parasols a la Gene Kelly. Ricky and Leah stare
in disbelief, then, what the hell, Leah grabs his arm.

LEAH
You heard the lady.

(CONTINUED)
55.
CONTINUED:

GRANNY BOONE
Grab your partner and give her a whirl!
Now twinkle your hair and give it a twirl!
Slap your backside and lift your arms!
‘Cuz the cows and the chickens is returning
to the barns!

Granny yanks on the bell. Everyone twirls around. Yep. Even
Leah and Ricky.

GRANNY BOONE
Little China Doll, ain't she sweet?
I'd reckon she'd make a real tasty treat!
Now dance ‘er on up to the Podium of Honor!
And let's bestow the honor upon ‘er!

Peaches and the Milk Maiden dance over and lead Leah and
Ricky to the porch. The two stand side by side, clapping in
time to the music. Feeling daring, Ricky breaks into an
impromptu Backstreet Boys routine.

GRANNY BOONE
Now the time has come to do what's right!

GIRLS
Right.

GRANNY BOONE
‘Cuz we've only begun to renew the fight!

GIRLS
Fight!

GRANNY BOONE
To avenge a horror that occurred in
this place...

The music stops. Granny Boone stares right at Leah. Speaks.

GRANNY BOONE
.»..it's your maker, now, bitch,
you'll have to face!

Granny Boone tugs hard on the cord. The five ton bell drops
from above, flattening Leah like a gory pancake. Entrails
spray everywhere. With deft panache, the girls open their
parasols to block the shower.

GRANNY BOONE
Damn, that China Woman had a lot of guts!

MILK MAIDEN
And she danced real pretty too!

(CONTINUED)
56.
CONTINUED:

Ricky stares at Leah's arms and legs which protrude from
the boulder like the "Wicked Witch of the East". Freaked
beyond belief, he takes off. The girls pursue.

EXT. BARBECUE PIT/PICNIC AREA - DAY
Ricky rounds the barn right into the arms of Rufus.

RUFUS
Gotcha!

RICKY
What the fuck...?!

RUFUS
We just fixin' to make us one'a
them Shis-kee-Bobs, loverboy!

Rufus drags Ricky over to a barbecue pit, where the
townsfolk and an open-hearth FIRE roar. Buckman walks over.

MAYOR BUCKMAN
I see the Festival's in full swing!
Enjoying yourselves, ladies?

Granny Boone and the girls CLAP and CHEER! Rufus slams
Ricky spread eagle onto a wooden picnic table.

MAYOR BUCKMAN
And how 'bout our honored guest?
He havin' so much fun he just can't
stand it?

Ricky can't answer. He's fixated on what's going on behind
him. The Barbecuties have lined up, holding a long, sharp,
gleaming steel POLE.

MAYOR BUCKMAN
I see our Barbecuties got the
skewerin' pole all ready!

Ricky's eyes go wide as Rufus holds him down. The pole is
now lined up with his rear end.

MAYOR BUCKMAN
Ramming speed!

The girls thrust the pole forward. Ricky SCREAMS as the
tip of the skewer rips through his open mouth.

GRANNY BOONE
Lookee lou! It's Rick on a stick!

(CONTINUED)
57.
CONTINUED:

Huge CELEBRATION. Buckman heads off, trailed by his sons.

RUFUS
I swear I didn't enjoy myself none
with that fella, Pappy!

LESTER
You a liar. You always volunteer for
sissy detail when it presents itself!

RUFUS
Do not!

LESTER
Do so!

MAYOR BUCKMAN
Will you boys please shut your traps!

It is then Buckman takes note of Jezebel, who proudly
sports a confederate flag sweater.

MAYOR BUCKMAN
What the hell you do to that mutton
chop now?

LESTER
Why, I done knit Jezebel a sweater!

MAYOR BUCKMAN
Done knit Jezebel a sweater? Jezebel
is a goddamned sweater, you moron!

INT. ROOSTER COCK SALOON - DAY

Loud, raucous southern saloon. Anderson, Cory and Malcolm
sit at the back table. They look tired, but troopers that
they are, still manage to work the mugs in front of them.

CORY
It was so wrong, bro, like Jerry
Springer, southern style. They
couldn't get enough of me. What was
I gonna do? Deny them? Hog myself?
And that's not the coolest part.

Cory leans in, to keep the next bit private.

CORY
Check this out. They're cousins.

(CONTINUED)
58.
CONTINUED:

ANDERSON
Corndog, you are the man!

Malcolm slams down a mug.

MALCOLM
I don't care what you guys say,
this place is fucked up. You don't
get something for nothing. I'm gonna
find Leah, and I'm outta here.

CORY
This place isn't so bad.

From behind them, Joey enters. Slams her mug on the table.

JOEY
Does any of this even remotely
resemble any place you've been to?
I mean, have you guys ever been
anywhere that didn't have phones or
electricity?

Joey sits down next to Anderson. All business.

JOEY
I was just back at my room. My
pager and cell are fucking gone.
Kat's nowhere to be found. That's
not like her. She would never just
disappear. And where the hell is
your good old buddy, Nelson?

CORY
(to Anderson)
You know, bro, it's really not like
Nelson to vanish with all this beer
around. Even if he was gakking that
Kat chick, you know he'd still launch
her at some point for free brew.

MALCOLM
You went off with Leah. Where is she?

JOEY
Drinking corn liquor and guest
starring on Hee Haw. Look, bottom
line, this is a bunch of bullshit. We
can get free booze in Daytona. I'm
tired of being the Guest of Honor.

Silence as it all sinks in. And then...

(CONTINUED)
59.
CONTINUED:

MALCOLM
She's right. I'm going after Leah.
g

Malcolm rises to leave. Anderson touches his shoulder.

ANDERSON
Look. We need to work together on
this. As a team. Let's split up.
Find Kat and Nelson. Find our rides.
And I say we watch each other's back.
We're in this together, right?

He looks around the table. At Malcolm.

MALCOLM
You got it, bro. We're tight till
we all hit the road.

ANDERSON

Good. I'll check out the ride
situation. Malcolm, you find Leah.

(to Cory and Joey)
You guys head back to the rooms and
get whatever stuff they haven't
ripped off.

(big fake smile)

Now everybody act like this is all
great. We love it. Don't let on
we're gonna bail. Okay?

JOEY
Now we're talking.

They get up to leave. Buckman, Harper, Rufus and Lester
block their way. The Mayor has his arm around Granny.

MAYOR BUCKMAN
You folks weren't inclining to
leave town now, were ya?

GRANNY
You wouldn't want us thinkin' you're
insultin' our heritage, would you?

ANDERSON
Of course not. We're thrilled to be
part of your thing here. So if you'll...

Buckman pulls back his coat. Brandishes a sharp, silver
broadsword from the scabbard at his side.

CORY
Oh, shit.

(CONTINUED)
60.
CONTINUED:

Harper pulls out his spiked gapping shoe and begins
cleaning his nails with it.

MAYOR BUCKMAN
I'll only say this once. This is the
biggest day of the year for the people
of Pleasant Valley. You could say it's
sacred. So y'all don't want to go
upsetting my kinfolk. Trust me on that.

HARPER
You see, we don't take too kindly
to rejection. Been known to react
harshly to them that crosses us.

Anderson notices that Harper has gouged his fingertips.
Blood seeps through the nails. Harper merely smiles.

ANDERSON
(accent slightly more southern)
I guess you're right, Mayor. We
shouldn't be so fast to up and
leave... this fine Festival.

Long wait. Is Buckman buying the bullshit? Of course he is.
He puts away his sword.

MAYOR BUCKMAN
Good. Now y'all best git goin'.
Wouldn't want to miss the Barbecue.

Anderson nods. Leads the group out the door, all eyes upon
them, like a closely watched funeral procession.

EXT. PLEASANT VALLEY TOWN SQUARE - DAY

Anderson, Cory, Joey and Malcolm exit the bar onto the
street which is now filled with TOWNSFOLK. Each "Guest of
Honor" can feel the people's stares, and for the first
time, sense the rot behind the colorful facade. Creepy...

Cory sidles up to Anderson as they pass a skinny, hairless
teen, ONION JOE, who stands before a scorched confederate
flag. Next to him is the BUTCHER, in bloodied apron.

CORY
What do you think happened to Nelson?

ANDERSON
Nothing happened to him. There's a
simple explanation for all of this.
Don't worry, buddy.
61.

INT. ROOSTER COCK SALOON - DAY
Buckman stands on a chair, addressing the enraptured crowd.

MAYOR BUCKMAN
Folks, I'd like to propose a toast.
To us, survivors, in a spiritual
sense, of the worst atrocity of all
times, the War Between The States!

Buckman raises his mug. The crowd follows suit.

EXT. PLEASANT VALLEY TOWN SQUARE - DAY

Joey and Malcolm cross paths with the fierce REVEREND JONAS
and his young, twin acolytes, OPIE and LAURA LEE.

MALCOLM
I always said the South hasn't
changed a damn. Leah would always
get mad at me when I'd say that...

JOEY
Kat and Ricky and me... We've done
some wild things... Nothing beats

this.

Jonas clutches his bible, gazing in judgment, as his long
black beard blows in the breeze.

MALCOLM
Yeah. All for a free meal. Shit...

INT. ROOSTER COCK SALOON - DAY

The crowd has tears in their eyes as they clink glasses,
holding on to Buckman's every word.

MAYOR BUCKMAN
I know you fine folks of Pleasant
Valley have suffered more than
seems possible. But one day, we
will find rest. We will be avenged.

Orgasmic APPLAUSE and approval.
62.

EXT. PLEASANT VALLEY TOWN SQUARE - DAY

The BLACKSMITH regards Anderson and Cory as they now pass
him by. His eyes are solid white. Milky. Blank.

CORY
Dude... What do you think this
Festival is really all about?

ANDERSON
No clue. But in the 'Sucks to be
You' department, we either, A,
stick around and find out or, B,
locate Nelson and jet.

To Cory's right, an overgrown manchild, GIBLET, sits naked
in a water trough. His bearded chaperone, AUNT SUZY Q,
rests quietly on a stool, smoking a corn cob pipe.

CORY
Easiest one yet, bro. We're history.

INT. ROOSTER COCK SALOON - DAY

The Strolling Minstrels strum "Battle Hymn of the Republic"
as Buckman winds up his oratory.

MAYOR BUCKMAN
And I tell you now, each and every
one of you fine, searching souls,
as God is my witness, I swear we
won't never go hungry again!

EXT. PLEASANT VALLEY TOWN SQUARE - DAY
Anderson and Cory fall in line Joey and Malcolm.
ANDERSON
Okay, kids. One hour. We'll regroup
at the hotel.

Malcolm walks ahead of the group, speaking loud,
purposefully, for all the Townsfolk to hear.

MALCOLM

Well, all right, then! See y'all at
the BBQ. Don't be late!

(CONTINUED)
63.
CONTINUED:

Anderson embraces Joey, trying to look casual. Kinda tough
to do when the local undertaker, COFFIN HARRY, is loudly
hammering nails into pine boxes on his front porch.

ANDERSON
Like he said, babe. Don't be late.
I still gotta give you my e-mail
address...

JOEY
You bet...

They kiss.

JOEY
Come on, Cory. Let's go.

Cory low-fives Anderson, then walks off with Joey. Anderson
lingers, watching them go.

EXT. WOODEN COTTAGE - DAY

Malcolm sneaks around the back yard of a wooden cottage.
Looking for a clue. Looking for Leah.

He passes TWO YOUNG BOYS who play in the yard, hovering
over a strange contraption made of Lincoln Logs. It looks
like a mini-ski slope down which they roll a mini-beer
barrel. Inside the barrel, a frightened MOUSE struggles to
keep its balance...

EXT. GRANNY BOONE'S HOTEL / BACKYARD - DAY

Cory and Joey hide behind the weeping willow and scope out
the hotel. They watch as Rufus loads their stuff, in fact,
all of the "Guest of Honor's" belongings, onto a wagon.
They look at each other, for the first time really afraid.

EXT. CAR BARN - DAY

Stalking about like a ninja, Anderson approaches the barn
doors and gives them a tug. Locked. Looking around, he
spots a pile of hay bails. He climbs on top, then pulls
himself up onto the barn roof. The rubber soles of his
shoes do not make for good traction, and it's all he can do
to maintain his grip. That's a real shame, because down
below Hester and Glendora are making their way around the
barn, absorbed in song.

And they've both got shotguns!!!!!
64.

EXT. WOODEN COTTAGE - DAY

Malcolm slowly edges around the cottage... walking right
into the fucking Strolling Minstrels who sit on the front
porch! The musicians waste no time serenading with yet
another of their lame ditties.

STROLLING MINSTREL A
There are lessons in this world.
Some are easy, some are hard...

STROLLING MINSTREL B
To swallow, that is...

MALCOLM
Not this shit again.

Malcolm brushes them off in disgust and walks down the dirt
road. But the duo gets up. Follows...

EXT. CAR BARN - DAY

Anderson hangs on to the roof for dear life as Hester and
Glendora chatterbox below.

HESTER/GLENDORA
Nothing is so sweet when you're
munching on the meat of a Yankee
who's doodle is so dandy...

HESTER
You think Mayor Buckman would mind
much if we kept that Anderson boy
to ourselves?

GLENDORA
Oh, I don't know, cousin. I'd rather
kill him than fuck him any day!

Anderson loses his hold and slides down the roof. He
catches himself just before falling to the ground. Whew!

GLENDORA
Shhh! Ya' hear somethin'?

The girls check out the barn, walking directly beneath
Anderson. He holds on to the edge of the roo, the jagged
wood cutting into his flesh....

HESTER
Probably just a rooster.
65.

EXT. WOODEN COTTAGE - DAY

Malcolm walks down the lane, trailed by the Strolling
Minstrels. They sing as they stalk.

STROLLING MINSTRELS
There was once a young lassie,
Slant-eyed and kind of sassy...

He walks faster. They walk faster.

STROLLING MINSTRELS
She had airs and conceit,
Till Granny she did meet.

Malcolm stops. Turns to face the Hillbilly Duo.

MALCOLM
Any of you shit-for-brains know
where my lady is, you better tell
me now!

STROLLING MINSTRELS
The boy wants his bitch.
Yeah, the boy wants his bitch.
Sad, sad thing, a boy without his
bitch.

And then they stop. Smile. Point. Malcolm turns to see the
familiar leather clad-form of Leah up ahead on the path.
Her long, black hair blows in the breeze as she playfully
dodges into the thicket, GIGGLING. Malcolm grins. Relieved.

MALCOLM
Talk about a sight for sore eyes!

He chases after her up the road.

EXT. CAR BARN - DAY

A stream of Anderson's BLOOD slowly trickles down the roof as
Hester and Glendora chat below...

GLENDORA
That reminds me of a joke Granny
told me. What's the difference
between a rooster and Ellie May?

HESTER
Well I'm sure I don't know, cousin.

(CONTINUED)
66.
CONTINUED:

The rivulet of red gets closer to the edge. Anderson is
sweating quite profusely. Of all the times for jokes!

GLENDORA
A rooster says "Cock a doodle do" and
Ellie May says "Any cock will do"!

Anderson winces. A droplet of blood spills downward, heading
directly for them...

HESTER
That's disgustin'!

Hester takes Glendora by the hand and pulls her away. The
blood splatters on the ground, barely missing them both!

HESTER
Now enough of your chatterbox.
We've got a festivation to attend.

WHEW! Anderson breaths relief. Renews his efforts to make
his way up the roof.

EXT. BATTLEGROUND - DAY

Leah runs out of a thicket into a wide open field. In the
middle is a large wooden platform, like a watchtower, nearly
twenty feet tall. A wooden sliding board leads down from the
top to a giant bulls-eye painted on the stone landing below.

Leah GIGGLES, tosses her hair. Heads up the watchtower ladder.

MALCOLM
C'mon, baby. No more clowning around!

Malcolm follows, hand over foot. Leah reaches the top. A
large beer barrel rests on a slab. The barrel is open at
both ends. She crawls inside.

MALCOLM
Okay, we both know Daddy likes
games. But you had me worried.
Where the hell you been, anyway?

More GIRLISH GIGGLES from the barrel. Going along with the
game, Malcolm walks over to the keg and peers inside.

MALCOLM
Give me a wet one, sugar muff.

Malcolm closes his eyes, puckers up. Nothing. What? No kiss?
He opens his eyes...

(CONTINUED)
67.
CONTINUED:

...coming face to face with the twisted grimace of Lester,
his face smeared with lipstick and rouge!!! Leah's bloody
scalp rests atop his head. He wears her leather duds.

MALCOLM
What the fuck...?

From inside the barrel, Lester grabs Malcolm's wrists and
yanks him through. Rufus pops out a trapdoor from below,
joining Lester as he wrestles with Malcolm.

MALCOLM
Who the fuck are you people?

Despite his kicks of protest, Lester and Rufus manage to gag
Malcolm, tying his hands behind his back. They then position
him so that his head and feet extend from either end of the
keg. From his new perspective, Malcolm can now see that
Mayor Buckman and the entire townsfolk have gathered in the
field below. They wave flags, CHEERING. What a hoot!

MAYOR BUCKMAN
It ain't so bad, you big baby! We
just gonna roll ya to the bottom,
is all. Then you're free to go.
If you can!

Lester hands Rufus a couple of hammers and a bucket of long
nails. They begin hammering them into the barrel.

MAYOR BUCKMAN
Oh, I almost forgot to tell ya!
We like to tickle ya a little on
the way down!

Malcolm's eyes bulge in rage. This simply is not happening.

MAYOR BUCKMAN
Roll out the barrel!

Rufus gives the barrel a good kick and it rolls down the
slide. Each revolution is pure agony for Malcolm as the
nails tear into his body, ripping him apart. Upon reaching
the edge, the barrel flips into the air, then crash lands
on the bulls-eye below.

Mayor Buckman rushes over and kneels besides Malcolm, who
lies impaled on the splintered wood. His chest heaves his
final, strangling breaths. Buckman jerks off his gag.

MAYOR BUCKMAN
Give us that death rattle, boy!
You can do it!

(CONTINUED)
68.
CONTINUED:

Silence as Malcolm coughs, chokes, then spits a chunky
mouthful of his own gore directly onto Buckman's
confederate flag eye patch, quickly erasing his smile.

MALCOLM
Kiss... my... black... ass!

With that, Malcolm expires. The crowd CHEERS. Atop the
tower, the Buckman Boys share a joyful embrace as Lester
removes his "wig".

RUFUS
Damn, Lester. You sure is sexy.

Below, Buckman wipes his face with his handkerchief.
Deeply perturbed.

MAYOR BUCKMAN
Next time, the gag stays on.

INT. GRANNY BOONE'S HOTEL / KITCHEN - DAY

The door cracks ajar. Cory and Joey peek through. Seeing
the place is deserted, the two enter...

BONG!! A metal pail falls from above, heading towards Joey.
Cory quickly pulls her aside, avoiding damage.

JOEY
Remind me to thank you later.

CORY
(forcing a smile)
At the beach house.

JOEY
Yeah. On the beach...

The two tiptoe over to an antique telephone on the wall.
Cory stands guard while Joey dials.

JOEY
(whisper)
Hello.... Hello...?

OPERATOR
(voice-over)
This is the Operator. May I have
the party you're trying to reach?

(CONTINUED)
69.
CONTINUED:

JOEY
(whisper)
Please connect me with the police!
This is an emergency!

OPERATOR
(voice-over)
Now if ya spend your time chattin'
on the phone, y'all gonna be late
for the barbecue!

Stunned, Joey slowly puts down the phone. Her expression
says everything to Cory. He gets it.

CORY
Anderson usually hides his cell
under the mattress. Maybe they
didn't find it yet. I'll go. You
wait here. Keep a lookout.

INT. CAR BARN - DAY

The silo window opens. Anderson peeks through. Down below,
Malcolm's motorcycle can be seen, parked in one of the
stalls. The only way down, however, is a twenty foot drop.
Contemplating his options, he leaps, landing on the
haystack. It cushions his fall, but an inch to the right,
and he would have been impaled on a rusty pitchfork...

INT. GRANNY BOONE'S HOTEL / MAIN HALL -DAY

Cory walks through the empty hall, then up the staircase,
step by measured step, careful not to make a sound.

INT. GRANNY BOONE'S HOTEL / KITCHEN - DAY

Joey stands alone. Nervous. Pacing. She begins to scan the
cupboards. Pie pans, rolling pin, wooden bowls...

INT. CAR BARN - DAY

Anderson creeps through the barn, footsteps crunching the
bone-dry hay. Cautious, he pauses. The crunching continues.
Could someone be watching? Nah... He forges forward,

passing a stockpile covered by a soiled tarp. Curious, he
lifts the edge. Gasps at the familiar objects heaped before
him: His school books. The beer cooler. The boogie board.
And Nelson's guitar. Broken. Bloodied. Cursing, he heads to
the stall housing Malcolm's bike.
70.

INT. GRANNY BOONE'S HOTEL / KITCHEN - DAY

Joey continues to take inventory, spotting a row of mason
jars on the pantry shelf. She gasps! Pickled eyeballs...
Pickled fingers... Pickled tongues... All human! And all
with a year scrawled on the Jlabel- Festival 1875...
Festival 1964...

Joey is about to scream when a hand thrusts out of the
darkness and covers her mouth! The unseen ATTACKER lifts
her and skirts out the back door.

INT. CAR BARN - DAY

Anderson hops on Malcolm's motorcycle, handkerchief wrapped
round his bloodied hand. Ready to roll. Except... No keys!
Then, a voice from the shadows...

HUCKLEBILLY
Ding dang doodle. I do believe you
were tryin' to steal that colored
boy's bike!

Hucklebilly stands guard at the door, dangling Malcolm's
keys like a carrot. Anderson approaches the boy. Slowly.

ANDERSON
I wasn't stealing, buddy. Just
borrowing. But what are you doing
with the keys to that bad boy?

HUCKLEBILLY
Well, truth be told, I reckoned to
take a little ride myself. But
Granny done say I can't on account
I gotta guard the barn all day...
Dumb old ugly bitch.

ANDERSON
I hear you, bro.

Hucklebilly slumps down on a bail of hay, twirling the keys.
Anderson sits beside him. Notes his leather wristband.

ANDERSON
Whoa, that's a cool ass wristband
you got there.

HUCKLEBILLY
Yeah. Reverend Jonas done give me
that for not tellin'.
71.

INT. ANDERSON'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

The door open. Cory enters. Gently closes the door behind
him. He turns to see a FIGURE emerging from the shadows.

CORY
Is that you, Kat??

PEACHES
Nope, just little old Peaches.

An ethereal vision, Peaches appears to glide across the
floor as she slowly unties her tank top. Scared shitless,
Cory is genuinely torn between caution and erection.

CORY
Ummmm, Joey's downstairs. She's
kinda waitin' for me...

Peaches locks the door, all buckteeth and smiles.

PEACHES
You Northern boys may be used to
uptight ladies like her...

She eases Cory onto the bed then gets down on her knees.

PEACHES
.»..but one country fuck will make
all them city girlies seem like
nuthin' but a hole in your mattress.

Cory is hesitant. Peaches begins covering her mouth.

CORY
You taking out your retainer, baby?

PEACHES
Nope. Putting something in my momma
made for naughty boys just like you.

Cory gets all excited. Peaches looks up and smiles----
She now wears a metal mouth piece with razor sharp edges!!!

PEACHES
Momma calls this my Penis Fly Trap!

Before Cory can protest, Peaches puts her head between his
legs and chomps... down... HARD! He opens his mouth to
scream, but nothing comes out, as a geyser of blood showers
him red with repeated spurts. Holding tight to his crotch,
Cory slides to the floor while Peaches licks her lips clean.
72.

INT. CAR BARN - DAY

Anderson sits beside Hucklebilly, WHISTLING along with the boy
as he SINGS an old rockabilly tune. Pure torture, for
Hucklebilly continues to dangle the keys. The keys to freedom.
Finally, Anderson hops to his feet, snaps his fingers.

ANDERSON
I know what! How about you and
I go for a ride? We'll find my
buddies. Play "Kill the Kitty"

HUCKLEBILLY
You mean it?

ANDERSON
Sure. Just toss me the keys and you
and I'll hit the road.

HUCKLEBILLY
Shoot, if I go for a ride with ya,
how in heck I gonna guard the barn?

ANDERSON
I won't tell Granny if you won't.
Whaddya' say?
He extends his hand. Hucklebilly smiles, forks over the keys.

HUCKLEBILLY
I say sheep doggie!

Anderson jumps to the barn doors and opens them wide.
Hester and Glendora stand there with guns, blocking the way!

HESTER
Ring the dinner bell.

GLENDORA
It's killing time.

He turns. Hucklebilly stands there grinning like the Devil,
aiming his slingshot...
HUCKLEBILLY
You really don't think I'm that
much of a moron, do ya?

KAPOW! Anderson takes a rock in the head. He falls to the
dirt, spilling blood, losing consciousness as everything

FADES TO BLACK
73.

EXT. BARBECUE PIT/PICNIC AREA - NIGHT

The world comes into view as Anderson slowly regains
consciousness. It is night now, a full moon, and to his
horror, Anderson discovers he is strapped down to a large
picnic table, gagged.

Flaming torches light the area, casting hellish shadows.
The whole town is there: Granny... Harper... Rufus...
Lester (and Jezebel)... Hester... Glendora... Peaches...
The Milk Maiden... Hucklebilly...

They sit around the table in wild anticipation, knives and
forks in hands. Mayor Buckman proudly presides at the head,
watching over a gagged Joey who is bound to her chair.

MAYOR BUCKMAN
Just in time for the grand finale!
It all comes down to this, year
after year. Don't it, Granny?

GRANNY BOONE
That it does. Too bad their friends
couldn't make it.

HARPER
Well, that's a matter of opinion.

Buckman's smile dims as he stares into Anderson's eyes.

MAYOR BUCKMAN
You Northern folk always thinkin'
you can waltz right in and bring us
low. But there ain't no escapin'
what y'all got comin' to you!

Anderson holds Buckman's gaze, refusing to look away. The
moment passes.

MAYOR BUCKMAN
So who's gonna say grace? Hucklebilly?

Hucklebilly rises from his seat, eyes closed, hands folded,
all pious and reverent. And then...

HUCKLEBILLY
To our guests from the North
spread at our feet, thanks for
being such tasty meat!

(CONTINUED)
74,
CONTINUED:

The crowd APPLAUDS! Bowls are passed, glasses filled. The
Strolling Minstrels break into a rousing rendition of "The
South is Gonna Rise Again". It's just like the 4th of July.
Sort of...

Buckman moves over to the buffet table. Hester and Glendora
walk up, each holding a silver platter. The Milk Maiden and
Peaches approach with another. Buckman smiles, pleased.

MAYOR BUCKMAN
Bet our guests will be mighty
impressed when they see what
Granny Boone cooked up!

Like a master chef showing off, he removes a lid to reveal
the lovingly prepared, barbecued heads of Cory and Nelson.
Their pried open mouths each hold a baked cinnamon apple.

MAYOR BUCKMAN
Bet you can't eat just one!

Buckman unveils the other platter containing Ricky and Kat.
A pineapple ring dangles from the skewer still protruding
from Ricky's gaping mouth. Joey and Anderson fight back
vomit as the girls place the dishes on the picnic table.

Rufus and Lester bring over two more platters.

MAYOR BUCKMAN
Y'all like dark meat?!

Buckman lifts another cover. It's Malcolm, chopped up amid
chitlins and blacked eye peas.

MAYOR BUCKMAN
Now, it might come as a surprise,
but me, I've always been partial
to Chinese.

Yep. The fourth plate contains what's left of Leah's head,
plus a couple of smashed body parts for garnishing. Buckman
grabs some Asian fried fingertips, pops 'em in his mouth.

MAYOR BUCKMAN
Only problem is, an hour later,
I'm still hungry!

Everyone CHEERS and begins dancing around the table,
clapping their hands, stomping their feet. Harper and
Hucklebilly ride Malcolm's motorcycle, circling the table.
The hellish flames from the barbecue pit seem to move to
the music as the Minstrels play faster and faster.

(CONTINUED)
75.
CONTINUED:

Joey shuts her eyes against the madness, nearly hysterical
from this insane, surrealistic nightmare.

Finally, Harper hops off the bike and leaps onto the picnic
table, brandishing one of his spiked gapping shoes.
Anderson braces as he edges closer.

HARPER
We was gonna' go easy on you, boy.
Being as you was a fellow reb.
Once, at least.

The razor sharp points are inches away from Anderson's
straining neck...

HARPER
But then little missy over here
done went and turned you.

Buckman leans in. Wipes Anderson's brow with his silk.

MAYOR BUCKMAN
Being a Southern gentleman, I just
might give you a second chance. All
you gotta do is... gut the bitch.

Buckman points to Joey. Her eyes widen in fear as Granny
holds out her rusty meat cleaver.

GRANNY BOONE
Why, it's just like gutting a
possum, honey.
Anderson studies Joey, the cleaver, the spikes at his neck.
Contemplating his options, he closes his eyes and nods-
affirmatively! Buckman grins and cuts his bindings.
MAYOR BUCKMAN
Welcome back, son, to the glory and
honor!
Anderson rises, takes the cleaver and walks over to Joey.
Tears flowing, she braces as he slowly lifts the blade
above her trembling head.

ANDERSON
Glory and honor...

Anderson swings the blade down...
WHOMP!

...cutting the ropes that bind Joey!

(CONTINUED)
76.
CONTINUED:

ANDERSON
You fucking maniacs wouldn't know
glory and honor if it bit you flat
on your Southern ass!

Anderson wings the blade at Buckman, but Rufus knocks him
down, taking the cleaver straight in the chest.

MAYOR BUCKMAN
Stop that Yankee traitor!

Hester and Glendora rush Anderson from behind, receiving a
mouth full of elbow as he coldcocks them both! The two topple,
knocking over a cast iron pot loaded with cooking oil.

WHOOSH! The fire pit ignites. A wall of flame spreads,
separating Anderson and Joey from the townsfolk.

ANDERSON
(removing her gag)
You okay?
JOEY

I'll kill those fucking bumpkins if
they even try and touch me again!

ANDERSON
I guess that means yes.

Anderson looks around. Points. Just yards away, Malcolm's
motorcycle lies on its side. Escape!

They head over. Peaches leaps over the flames, taking Joey
down, all set to vampire her ass with her metal mouth gear.

Anderson moves in to assist, but Harper jumps in his way.
His wields a spiked horseshoe, swinging at Anderson with
wild sweeps, slashing, cutting...

On the other side of the flames, Lester helps Buckman to
his feet as Rufus extracts the cleaver like it was nothing.

RUFUS
Please don't beat me, Daddy!

Buckman grimaces, brushes his sons aside, then stands atop
a table to observe the scrapple. The crowd follows suit
more interested in watching the ladies bout than ducking
the encroaching flames.

MAYOR BUCKMAN
That city girl's got more ballsack
then you two flapjacks combined!

(CONTINUED)
77.
CONTINUED:

Joey has become a wild animal, beating mercilessly on
Peaches. Hucklebilly watches from the crowd, intrigued. Is
that a tit he sees? Wanting to feel useful, he aims his
slingshot at Joey and opens fire... BAM!... hitting Granny
Boone square in the chest! She hits the dirt. The crowd
CHEERS, morons that they are.

Meanwhile...

Harper swings at Anderson. Slices his chest, his stomach...
Anderson ducks, rolls to the ground, kicks Harper in the knee.
Harper drops the spiked horseshoe, which Anderson retrieves.

Back to the catfight...

Joey is about to deliver the final blow to Peaches when the
Milk Maiden jumps in with her infamous jug. She hurls it.
Joey flips out of the way. The container whacks Peaches in
the cranium, cracking open and bathing her with acid!

Back to the cockfight...

Harper charges Anderson, who lies on the ground. Anderson
swings forth with the spiked shoe, impaling Harper in the
jugular. Blood spurts forth from the wound.

WHOOSH! Buckman empties a bucket of water onto the flames,
quenching the fire. All eyes turn.

MAYOR BUCKMAN
Y'all stand back. They're mine now.

He moves forward, removing a long, gleaming sword. Hushed
reverence grips the crowd as their Mayor licks his lips.

MAYOR BUCKMAN
Shock and awe, folks. Shock and awe...

Buckman lunges at Joey and Anderson, swinging his blade
wide and madly. Joey rolls to the ground, banging her head.
She lies there, stunned, as Anderson hops on the table.
Buckman slashes, cutting the table's front legs in half.

The table and Anderson come crashing down, as do the
silver platters and severed heads, which spill all over him.

Defiant, Buckman lifts his sword and readies for the
killing blow. But as he brings the blade down, Anderson
grabs the nearest food scrap to block.

THUNK!!! The blade connects... cutting into the back of
Cory's severed head! Face to "face" with his old friend,
Anderson freaks, tossing "it", and the blade, aside.

(CONTINUED)
78.
CONTINUED:

Filled with renewed vigor, Anderson jumps up and violently
hammers Buckman again and again, with a cut to the left and
a cut to the right.

POW!! POW!!

Shaking it off, Joey moves to Anderson's side and joins
in the drubbing.

BAM! ! BAM!!

The two pummel Buckman, relentless in their rage. Joey
kicks him to his knees. Anderson wallops him in the face...

...knocking off Buckman's confederate flag eye patch,
unmasking a web of flesh which bisects a gaping cavity
Buckman roars, possessed, pathetically searching the ground
for his fallen eye covering.

Anderson grabs Joey.

ANDERSON
You with me?

JOEY
All the way.

The two rush to the motorcycle, hop on. Anderson guns the
engine and they take off, circling the field, looking for
an out. But everywhere they turn, they are surrounded by
maniacs. Leering. Venomous. Fucking frightening as hell.

Buckman rushes forward, eye patch in hand. Anderson heads
straight towards him, gunning the engine.

Buckman steadies himself, smirks at Anderson, savoring
their twisted game of "chicken"... that is, until he
himself chickens out, ultimately stepping aside.

Like Steve McQueen, Anderson hits the fallen picnic table.
It serves as a ramp as the bike vaults its way up and over
the townsfolk, away from Pleasant Valley and everyone in it.

Buckman rushes forward, impotent as Anderson and Joey make
their getaway. Flanked by his bloody, wounded flock
(Harper, Granny, Rufus, Lester... hell, all the maniacs),
Buckman grinds his teeth, huffing, puffing. A man insane.

The camera slowly MOVES IN on his vacant eye socket as a
WALL OF FIRE covers the frame and we

DISSOLVE TO:
79.

INT. SHERIFF'S STATION - NIGHT

SHERIFF FREIDMAN lounges at his desk, reading "Famous
Monsters" magazine. At his feet, his loyal hound dog,
ELVIS, gnaws on a bone. Another busy night at the office...

BAM! The door bolts open. Anderson and Joey rush in,
bloodied and crazed. Sheriff Freidman goes for his gun.

ANDERSON
No, no, no! Don't shoot!

SHERIFF FREIDMAN
What the Hell is your problem, boy,
chargin' in at this hour?

ANDERSON
You gotta help us!

JOEY
They killed our friends! They murdered
them. And then they... They ate them!
They fucking barbecued our friends!

SHERIFF FREIDMAN
What in God's name you talkin' about?

ANDERSON
I know it sounds crazy, but it's
true! What she says is true! The
folks in Pleasant Valley. They're
insane! Murderers!

Behind Anderson, in the jail cell, CONNIE MASON, a
beautiful, inexplicably well-groomed inmate, grips the bars
of the cell. She has a glazed look in her eyes.

CONNIE
I told you, Sheriff! Those people
are... maniacs!

Freidman glares at Miss Mason. She hushes.

JOEY
They put this sign on the road,
fooled us into coming to their
town... Told us we were gonna be
guests for some special Festival...

CONNIE
We were just on a trip... Just
travelling south...

(CONTINUED)
80.
CONTINUED:

ANDERSON
And then they started killing us
one by one...

SHERIFF FREIDMAN
Pleasant Valley, you say?

JOEY
You know Pleasant Valley, right?

SHERIFF FREIDMAN
Yeah... I know it, all right.

The Sheriff takes a deep breath. Ponders his intruders
Ponders Miss Mason. Decided, he puts his gun away.

SHERIFF FREIDMAN
I think you, me and Elvis need to
take a little ride.

Anderson and Joey sigh relief. Connie stares forlorn.

CONNIE
Feels like I've been here for
forty years...

INT/EXT. HIGHWAY ROAD - NIGHT

Anderson and Joey ride ahead of the Sheriff, who follows
diligently in his squad car, hound dog by his side.

EXT. HIGHWAY ROAD (FURTHER UP) - NIGHT

The infamous hand painted "Detour" sign lies flat at an
angle atop a pile of sawed-off branches. Seeing this, the
motorcycle turns off the highway and onto the dirt road.
The squad car trails behind.

EXT. DIRT ROAD/ENTRANCE - NIGHT

The motorcycle drives along the dirt road, passing beneath
the "Pleasant Valley. Population 2001" welcome sign before
coming to a halt. Anderson and Joey dismount as the squad
car pulls up behind. The Sheriff gets out, flips on the
spotlight and aims it at the clearing...
81.

EXT. CEMETARY - NIGHT

Anderson and Joey now see that they are standing dead
center in the middle of a timeworn burial ground!!!!

Rows of graves sprawl before them, graves carved with names
frighteningly familiar: Virginia Boone.. Harper Alexander..
Hester and Glendora.. Rufus, Lester (and Jez, of course)...

Anderson and Joey circle round in shock, trying to make
sense of it all. Sheriff Freidman stares them down.

SHERIFF FREIDMAN
I ought to lock you both up for
wastin' my precious time! This is
your Pleasant Valley! Ain't nothing
but a graveyard been here the last
hundred fifty years. If I hada
dollar for every drunken college
kid come hollerin' about flesh
eatin' ghouls, me and Elvis coulda
retired in comfort years ago.

Anderson and Joey back away from Freidman. This can't be
happening.

JOEY
No! There was a town here! People...
We saw them!

SHERIFF FREIDMAN
Missy, I'm just gonna assume you've
been smokin' that reefer and let it
go at that!

JOEY
No way, man! You're full of shit!

Sheriff Freidman takes out his handcuffs. Anderson steps
forward in defense.

ANDERSON
All right! Stop! We're sorry! It
was... a joke. A prank...

The Sheriff puts away the cuffs. Smirks.

SHERIFF FREIDMAN
I'm sure the poor souls of these
fine people who died at the hands
of you Northern heathens ain't so
partial to your joke!

(CONTINUED)
82.
CONTINUED:

Sheriff Freidman points a marble statue. None other than
the chiseled likeness of Mayor George W. Buckman himself.
Buckman looms tall and proud, standing guard over a
tarnished plaque, circa 1862, imbedded in the earth below.

JOEY
What?

Like a teacher proving his history lesson, Freidman shines
his flashlight on the plaque's inscription.

SHERIFF FREIDMAN
It's called respect, son.

Stunned, Anderson and Joey walk over to the plaque. Slowly,
he begins to read aloud.

ANDERSON
"To the 2001 innocent confederate
citizens of Pleasant Valley laid to
waste on this very spot by renegade
Yanks during The War Between the
States, this plaque is hereby devoted
as a pledge of blood justice. An eye
for an eye, a tooth for a tooth,
never will they rest in peace till
one for one they are avenged..."

JOEY
It's dated March 22nd. That's...
today.

The sound of SCREECHING TIRES jolts them to attention. They
turn to see the Sheriff's car pulling away, the DAWNING SUN
now beginning to peek through the trees.

Alone, Anderson and Joey survey the desolate landscape.
2001 graves.......
JOEY

Could we really have just imagined

it all? Could it possibly be some

kind of joke?
Anderson points to the gash in his forehead.

ANDERSON
This is real. And it's no joke.

That inbred Sheriff is probably one
of them. We gotta do something.

(CONTINUED)
83.
CONTINUED:

JOEY
Maybe if we ride further north...
What if we went to the FBI?
ANDERSON

Forget the FBI. I say we get the

fucking Marines and invade the

South all over again.
The WIND blows through the cemetery, rustling the leaves of
an old oak tree. The effect is that of a ghostly whisper...
Or is it laughter?
Joey wraps her arms around Anderson.

JOEY
You're on.

She seals the pact with a kiss, continuing to hold on to
Anderson for a moment of comfort. But the moment's soon
over when Anderson pulls away and, with forceful venom,
spits directly onto Buckman's marbled face.

The final desecration...

ANDERSON
Fuck you, Pleasant Valley.

With that, Anderson takes Joey's hand and heads out.

EXT. DIRT ROAD OUT OF PLEASANT VALLEY - DAWN

The motorcycle drives past the roadside sign ("Pleasant
Valley. Population 2001") coursing away from the town.

EXT. CEMETARY - DAWN

Spittle drips down the stone face of Mayor Buckman, which
now appears to be smiling a malevolent grin...

EXT. DIRT ROAD OUT OF PLEASANT VALLEY - DAWN

Further up ahead...

A FIGURE can be seen standing in the center of the road.
Anderson slows the bike down and cautiously inches forward.

Once closer, he and Joey can see that the figure is
Hucklebilly, waving his arms and hootin' and hollerin'.

(CONTINUED)
84.
CONTINUED:

JOEY
Oh no, not again...

ANDERSON
Fuck that little shit. We'll drive
around him.

Anderson floors the engine and speeds right past
Hucklebilly, knocking him flat on his ass.

The boy behind them, he and Joey turn around to take one
last glimpse at Pleasant Valley. They can't help but laugh
with relief.

Now turning to face the course ahead, they detect a line of
rusty BARBED WIRE extended across the dirt road between two
telephone poles.

It's too late to stop... Or scream.

The motorcycle glides under the sharpened cord, which cuts
through the necks of both Anderson and Joey. Their
decapitated heads fly from their bodies, which continue to
ride the two-wheeler before it comes to a crashing halt and
EXPLODES .

The liberated heads emerge from the FLAMES, bouncing along
the path like bloody basketballs.

With great finesse, Hucklebilly runs and scoops them up. A
Cheshire grin crosses his face from ear to ear.

HUCKLEBILLY
Damn Yankees!

A severed head in each hand, the boy walks off into the
southern sunrise, whistling Dixie...

FADE OUT
