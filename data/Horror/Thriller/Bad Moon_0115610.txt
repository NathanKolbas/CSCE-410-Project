FADE “IN:

1 EXT. JUNGLE - NEPAL, INDIA - DUSK

The vast, primordial jungle. Exotic, mist-shrouded
mountainscapes loom in the gathering dusk.

2 EXT. NEPALESE SKY - DUSK

The remote primeval landscape is bathed in strange,
sweltering twilight. The setting sun is a weird fireball
behind the palm trees. . The moon is a ghost on the horizon.

3 EXT. CLEARING - NEPAL - NIGHT .
A few tents pitched in the clearing...”

A campfire burns... :

4 EXT. CAMP - NEPAL - NIGHT

A JUNGLE EXPEDITION has pitched camp. 6 NATIVES are stoking
the campfire and cooking food. 3 PACK HORSES are tethered to
a post. THE PHOTOGRAPHER, is a ruggedly handsome American
man in khaki jungle gear, several cameras slung around his
neck. He is reviewing a map with THE NATURALIST, a stunning
and outdoorsy Australian woman. She is labeling numerous
rolls of 35mm film with a magic marker.

PHOTOGRAPHER
We're thirty miles northeast of the upper
plateau. There's an outpost and an
airstrip ten miles due north here...

He points to a mark on the map.

PHOTOGRAPHER
We can have the film flown out to Delphi
from there. They can pouch it to the
field office in Calcutta. Old Jones
should be happy...we're only two weeks
past deadline.

She kisses him lovingly.

clearing, their Native Guides are stoking the campfire.

INT. TENT - CAMP - NIGHT

The Photographer and the Naturalist enter the tent. She sits
down and begins brushing her hair. He lifts his camera and
SNAPS a few shots of his lovely girlfriend.

NATURALIST
Stop it.

He lowers his camera.

PHOTOGRAPHER
Okay.

He takes her in his arms and they kiss in a passionate
embrace.

EXT. JUNGLE - NEPAL - NIGHT

The full moon now visible in the darkened sky.

EXT. CAMP - NEPAL - NIGHT

The Native Guides stoke the coals of the fire with sticks.
They listen to the SOUNDS of the MONKEYS, BIRDS, and INSECTS
in the dense trees lining the perimeter of the clearing.

They hear the SOFT SIGHS coming from the one tent. The
Natives exchange grins and shake their heads as they tend the
fire.

Then all SOUNDS of WILDLIFE abruptly cease.

Silence.

The Native Guides lift their heads, alert. The jungle is
totally, preternaturally quiet. One man rises to his feet
uneasily. He nervously looks around him at the darkened
clearing. It is pitch black on all sides beyond the dim glow
of the campfire. :

The horses in the stalls begin to snort and paw the earth
with their hoofs. The horses suddenly rear and yank at their
tethers. Their wild eyes stare into the dark, silent jungle.
Three Natives begin babbling anxiously to one another.

Suddenly, a LOW GROWL emanates from the brush. Like a wolf.
But not.

The horses rip loose of their posts and gallop off in panic

into the jungle.

INT. TENT - CAMP NIGHT 8
The Photographer and The Naturalist make passionate love in a
sleeping bag...Their erotic sighs and exclamations drown out

all noises outside the tent.

EXT. CAMP - NIGHT : 9
Fear explodes across the Guides' faces. They are frozen in

place, paralyzed with terror. One looks over to see his

rifle resting against his tent twenty yards away. _

Three Natives scream and bolt into the jungle.

Two more of the Natives run off in the’ other direction.

GROWL.

With a cry of terror, the remaining Native Guide runs for his

rifle.

A WEREWOLF drops out of the trees and goes for the man's
throat!

Bloodshot, insane eyes...Salivating fangs...Hairy half-man,
half-wolf features...Huge claws. The creature is half-seen,
a psychopathic-eyed apparition of fangs, claws, and fur in
the firelight. The Native Guide's screams are cut short as
he is torn to shreds by the Werewolf.

INT. TENT - CAMP - NIGHT 10
The Photographer and the Naturalist are still making love in

the sleeping bag. Over their passionate sighs, he hears

something outside the tent. He lifts his head.

PHOTOGRAPHER
Did you hear something?

She nibbles his lip.

NATURALIST
Um-hmmmm.

They kiss and continue what they were doing.

EXT. CAMP - NEPAL - NIGHT 11

The Werewolf heaves the Native Guide's corpse into the trees.
The creature rears in the firelight, its talons and jaws
dripping with gore.

Its crazed, bloodshot eyes focus on the tent across the
clearing.

WEREWOLF P.O.V.: B&W. ITS HEART POUNDING IN IT'S CHEST.

ITS BLOOD ROARING IN ITS EARS. THE SOFT HUMAN SIGHS FROM THE
TENT. THE TENT. MAKING ITS WAY SWIFTLY ACROSS THE
CLEARING...TOWARDS THE TENT.

INT. TENT - CAMP - NIGHT 12

The Photographer rolls on top of the Naturalist in the
sleeping bag. Her eyes widen as she sees the hideously
unnatural silhouette of the Werewolf rear up outside the
tent. She screams hysterically. The Photographer whirls
just as the huge, razor-clawed paw shears through the tent
canvas. She tries to crawl away, but the creature gets a
fistful of her hair. It drags her right off her feet outside
the tent. The Werewolf buries it's jaws into her. The girl
screams and flails hysterically as she is held off the ground
and ripped apart by the Werewolf. The man sees only flashes
of claws and snapping fangs amid the flying fur.

NATURALIST
TEDOHMYGOOOOO0--HELPHELP! !!

PHOTOGRAPHER
NOOOOO!!!

The Photographer leaps at the Werewolf.
It whirls on him, slashing its razor fangs across his torso.
His shoulder is torn open, and he is tossed fifteen feet.

The man lands on the ground by the backpacks, his shoulder
mauled.

His vision is BLURRY, semi-conscious. He sees the thing toss
the girl's dead body away like a rag doll.

And it comes for him.
The Photographer sees a shotgun. By the packs.

He grabs up the shotgun and PUMPS a CARTRIDGE into the
BREECH.

The man aims blindly, pulling the trigger.

He blows the Werewolf's head clean off.

It drops decapitated in the dirt, killed instantly.

The Photographer slumps out cold on the ground, his eyes
rolled up in their sockets...

SMASH CUT TO:

EXT. "FOREST EDGE" - WASHINGTON STATE + DAY 13

THE CREDITS ARE SUPERIMPOSED OVER A HELICOPTER SHOT SWEEPING
HIGH above the green, lush pine forest. Rugged, untamed
natural scenery for miles and miles. Then, down below, at
the edge of the woods, is nestled a comfortable, middle-class
neighborhood of tract houses and safe, clean streets. The
trees part and the quiet suburban town of "Forest Edge"
spreads out before us. The HELICOPTER SHOT travels over the
town to FRAME a house situated a bit secluded at the edge of
the woods.

The SOUND of a DOG BARKING.

THOR, a big, healthy, friendly German Shepherd leaps up and
grabs a baseball.

BRETT HARRISON
Good dog! Bring it back, Thor.

The canine scampers onto--

EXT. FRONT LAWN - HARRISON HOUSE - DAY 14

Thor takes the baseball onto the front lawn and drops it at
the feet of BRETT HARRISON, 10. The little boy roughhouses
with his pet on the freshly cut lawn of their all-American
home. Thor jumps and prances, dodging back into the street
to play catch again.

Brett heaves the ball.
ZOOM IN on Thor's eyes...

THOR P.O.V.: BLACK AND WHITE. HIS VISION IS HEIGHTENED,
ULTRA~AWARE. THE SOUNDS OF THE BIRDS AND WILDLIFE IN THE
FOREST AT THE EDGE OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD ARE DENSE AND DETAILED
IN THE STEREOPHONIC DUB. DISTANT CARS AND TRUCKS AND VOICES
OF NEIGHBORS IN THEIR HOUSES ARE CLEARLY HEARD. NOW, HIS
VISION FOCUSES ON THE BASEBALL HISSING THROUGH THE AIR AT
HIM, HE LEAPS AND...

Thor snatches the baseball.
He pads back onto the lawn and drops it by Brett's feet.

BRETT
Gimmie five.

Thor enthusiastically puts his paw in Brett's hand.

BRETT
Good boy. Yr

Brett leans down and affectionately hugs Thor. The dog licks
the kid's face.

Then his head lifts.
In the distance, up the block...
A man approaches. i

The FLOPSY wears a dark suit and sunglasses, carrying an
attache case. He is making good time up the sidewalk. Thor
pays full attention. The Flopsy seems to be coming directly
towards their house, ignoring the other houses on the way.

The dog's hackles rise. He wills them down.

Flopsy comes up to the front yard. Near the boy. Behaving
nonchalantly, Thor saunters across the lawn and places
himself between Brett and Flopsy. The German Shepherd takes
pains not to appear intimidating.

Thor watches Flopsy. The man adjusts his dark glasses.
Thor's hackles rise. He wills them down. He casts a glance
to Brett playing with the Frisbee. Then he returns his gaze
to Flopsy. The man doesn't seem to fear Thor, huge German
Shepherd that he is.

FLOPSY
Nice doggie.

Thor just eyes him.

THOR P.O.V.: BLACK AND WHITE. SOMETHING TENSE AND HARD
ABOUT THE FLOPSY. THOR DOESN'T HEAR SPECIFIC WORDS, JUST
TONE OF VOICE, AND THE MAN'S TONE IS ONE OF PHONY
FAMILIARITY.

FLOPSY
NICE DOGGIE.

Thor doesn't blink.

FLOPSY
You're a big one, aren't you? Are you a
dog or a horse?

Thor emits a low RUMBLE from deep in his throat.
t

Flopsy actually grins.

BRETT
He's not a horse! He's a German
Shepherd! ‘
Thor sees Brett has come up from behind. The German Shepherd
easily positions himself between the disturbing man and the
little boy. Flopsy wipes sweat from his brow.
FLOPSY :
Well, he's a helluva big German
Shepherd. Are your Mom and Dad home?
Thor squints.

THOR P.O.V.: BLACK AND WHITE. PANNING FROM THE MAN'S
ANKLES, TO HIS GROIN, TO HIS EXPOSED THROAT.

Flopsy inches back a little.

The screen door on the porch opens. JANET HARRISON, Mom,
attractive, in her late 30's, hurries across the lawn.

JANET
Can I help you?

FLOPSY
Ah, you must be the lady of the house.

Mom faces Flopsy.

THOR P.O.V.: B&W. EYEING THE MAN'S HANDS AND FEET, AS THEY
TWITCH WITH ILL-CONCEALED NERVOUSNESS. THE MAN'S WORDS ARE
INCOMPREHENSIBLE, BUT THE TONE IS SMUG, EASY, TOTALLY
DISHONEST.

Thor's hackles rise.

JANET
Yes, I am.

FLOPSY
Well, Ma'am, I see you have a young boy.
Are you helping him to get the best
education possible? I represent The
Pacific Northwest Magna Reading Project,
and we have a series of books which
studies have proved are a major benefit
towards advanced learning in phonetics
and word comprehension. If I could have
five minutes of your time to show you--

JANET
Thank you, but we really aren't
interested in buying--
FLOPSY ‘
Please let me show you these books my
company has developed--
He opens his attache case.
Thor lets out a low, threatening GROWL;

FLOPSY
I have them right here.

Flopsy reaches his hand into his case. He eyes Thor with a
strange glint of opportunism in his eyes.

Thor gives the man a single, vicious, snapping BARK.
FLOPSY
HEY, LOOK, LADY! YOU EVER HEARD OF A
LEASH LAW?! YOU BETTER CONTROL YOUR DOG
BEFORE HE BITES SOMEBODY!
Mom looks upset.

JANET

She reaches down to slip her finger into the metal ring of
Thor's collar. As she does so, she takes her eyes off Flopsy
for a moment.

Flopsy makes deliberate eye contact with Thor.

Thor sees Flopsy make a quick, flailing movement with his
free hand over Mom's neck. Like he is about to punch her.

BRETT
HEY!

That does it.

With a violent growl, Thor leaps. He hits Flopsy full in the
chest with front and hind legs, dropping him like a bowling
pin. The ninety pound German Shepherd pins him to the
pavement, police dog style. Flopsy looks in terror at the
bared fangs of the dog at his throat. -
.
FLOPSY
HELP! GET HIM OFF ME!

JANET
THOR! GET OFF HIM!

Thor looks up at Mom, and obediently gets off the man.
Flopsy sits up, angrily brushing himself off.

FLOPSY
HE BIT ME! I'M SUING! YOU GOT A
DANGEROUS ANIMAL THERE, LADY, AND YOU'RE
GOING TO PAY FOR IT! YOU BETTER GET A
LAWYER, LADY! ‘CAUSE YOU'RE GONNA HEAR
FROM MINE, TOOT SWEET!

Janet stands over him, nonplussed.

JANET
You- can talk to me.

Mom pulls a small white card out of her wallet and tosses it
contemptuously to Flopsy.

JANET
I'm a lawyer.

Before Flopsy can react, Janet reaches down and jerks the
jacket from the man's shoulder. There is no wound.

JANET
I don't see what you're going to sue for,
except maybe the price of a new suit at
K-Mart.

(CONTINUED }

FLOPSY
Hey, listen, lady. I don't care if you
are a lawyer. Your dog attacked me, and
if you don't want to settle, fine. I
won't sue you. I'll go to the humane
society and show them what he did. I'll
get a court order and have him destroyed.

Baffled, Thor looks back and forth between Mom and Flopsy.
He lets out a low GROWL.

JANET
Get in the house, Thor!

Mom points the dog towards the house. If possible, the
German Shepherd is on the verge of tears of confusion and
shame. He has no choice. He does what he is told. Thor
slinks away, tail between his legs. He slumps on the porch
and watches the heated interchange between his master and the
stranger who apparently threatened Mom.

Mom faces Flopsy furiously as the man lies on the ground.

JANET
Did he bite you?

Flopsy hesitates.
JANET
Because if he bit you, you'll have to see
a doctor right now. Since you're on
foot, I'll give you a lift to the nearest
hospital emergency room right now.
Janet holds out her hand to help the man up.

JANET
I'll take you to our family doctor.

FLOPSY
I got my own doctor!

JANET
All right. I think I've heard about
enough, Flopsy.

BRETT
Who's Flopsy, Mom?

Janet stares down Flopsy.

JANET

A flopsy, Brett, is a con man who does
things like walk in front of cars and
pretend to get hit. Or intentionally
provoke people's dogs and pretend to get
bitten. He threatens to sue people or
have their pets destroyed unless they pay
him money. I've prosecuted plenty of
these guys.

FLOPSY
I'll--I'1ll see you in court.

The con man fidgets like a pinned bug. Thor watches Mom's
demeanor from the sidelines, and his German Shepherd jowls
break into a loose grin as he sees whatever it is going on,
Mom is winning.

JANET .
Brett, call Sheriff Jenson. Tell him
you're my son, he'll take the call. Tell
him we have a problem and to send a.

Janet turns to Flopsy. with a grin.

JANET
It was nice knowing you, Flopsy. I'll
visit you in the slammer.

FLOPSY
YOU F--! i

The man explodes in anger.
Thor leaps up on his haunches and BARKS violently.
Mom whirls on Thor and roars ferociously.

: JANET
STAY!

With a dismal WHINE of dismay, Thor miserably hangs back on
the stoop. His eyes still remain protectively fixed on
Flopsy.

JANET
Now, my advice to you is to turn around,
and walk away without saying another word
and without looking back.

The humiliated con man stumbles away up the sidewalk. He
wags his finger at Janet.

Mom turns her back on Flopsy and ushers Brett back towards
the house.

Thor, the big German Shepherd, sits small and fearful on the
porch, his tail helplessly thumping.

Mom kneels down beside Thor, grabbing him not untenderly by
the jowls. She looks him affectionately in the face.

JANET
Listen to me, numbskull. I know you were
just doing your job and trying to
protect us. But we could have lost you
today. If you bite somebody they can
take you away from us and take you to the
pound and there wouldn't be anything we
could do. You're the man of the house,
Thor. What would we do without the man
of the house, huh?

BRETT
Mom, go easy on him. He was just trying
to protect us. He's our dog, and he was
looking out for us.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. TRAIL - FOREST - NIGHT 26

A rugged, mountainous expanse of pine forest. A flashlight
cuts through the trees. A HIKER with a backpack treks along
the moonlit pine forest path. He stops and checks his watch.
He takes a map out of his jacket and checks his coordinates.
He takes out his compass. Clearly lost, he puts his gear
back in his jacket.

And hikes on into the dark forest. r

EXT. FOREST - NIGHT . 27

The moon hovers over the vast timber country.

EXT. TRAIL - FOREST - NIGHT 28

A flashlight beam glints through the pine branches. The
Hiker comes down the trail, small and alone. He is dwarfed
by the huge pine trees, using his flashlight to make his way.
The SOUNDS of the FOREST WILDLIFE fill the SOUNDTRACK. BIRDS.
INSECTS. OWLS. A STEADY, OUTDOORSY DIN. The Hiker stops to
get his bearings, shining his flashlight on the trees.
Silvery moonlight filters through the branches in misty
shafts. The man adjusts his backpack and moves on. The
SOUND of his BOOTS CRUNCHING TWIGS.

Then suddenly...all the ANIMAL NOISES in the forest stop.
Silence.

The Hiker stops and listens-to the uncanny, preternatural
quiet. Apprehension registers on his features. It's as if
all the wildlife in the woods have been scared silent.

From far off, a TERRIFYING WOLFLIKE HOWL rips the air. The
Hiker is petrified by the half-wolf, half-human cry. He

turns pale, hurrying on at a brisk pace down the path,
flitting his flashlight beam ahead.

The WOLFLIKE ROAR reverberates through the forest again.
This time, much closer.

The Hiker looks over his shoulder, but sees only walls of
trees. The circle of his flashlight beam begins to dim.
Then it darkens and goes out. The Hiker swears below his
breath, barely able to see in the moonlit forest. Beaded
with sweat, he fumbles in his backpack for a battery. He
frantically inserts it into his flashlight. The beam of
light blinks back on.

The SOUND of a HUGE ANIMAL SMASHING THROUGH THE TREES AND
BRANCHES of the FOREST.

The Hiker cries out in fear and runs for his life... He heaves
off his backpack and bolts up the trail. Looking over his
shoulder, he sees something shattering through the branches
fifty feet behind him. The huge shape, is covered with fur,
its claws glinting in the moonlight. The Hiker runs panic-
stricken through the forest. The ROARS of the thing fill his
ears. The Hiker scrambles up a tree, shimmying ten feet up
to the first branches. He tries to climb higher. Suddenly,
the tree is shaken powerfully, heaving him sideways. He
shines his flashlight down at the creature shaking the tree.

A Werewolf!

The Hiker screams in raw terror and heaves the flashlight
between the Werewolf's eyes. It bounces off the creature's
skull. The Werewolf flies into a psychopathic rage, chewing
and scratching at the tree. Bark and wood pulp fly like from
a chain saw. The Hiker holds on for dear life as the tree is
violently shaken back and forth. He tries to climb higher
but can't. The Werewolf is swiftly gnawing through the trunk
of the tree, trying to break it in half.

A CRACK of SPLINTERING woop.

The Hiker screams helplessly as the tree he hangs onto starts
to topple. The Werewolf waits for him with fangs bared and
claws outstretched as the tree breaks.

The Hiker falls head over heels into the clutches of the
Werewolf.

And is torn to pieces.

apparatus. Beakers and Bunsen burners,’ hypodermics,
chemicals in test tubes and jars. A microscope. Piles of
medical books open and scattered around the closet. Notes
and complex chemistry equations are scribbled on notepads and
all over the walls. The area has the atmosphere of feverish,
frantic research. The little boy looks around the closet
eyeing the medical setup in astonishment.

Something catches Brett's eye.
An ancient, antique book on the floor.

The little boy opens it. He gasps, reading on in awe and
terror...

The book has page after page of medieval woodcuts of

Shepherd noses through the clothes. Until he finds something
metallic.

A set of handcuffs.

UNCLE TED
Hey, Thor, get outta there!

Too late. Mom has seen the handcuffs.
She bursts out in uncontrollable chuckles.

JANET
Handcuffs, Ted?

Uncle Ted stares at Janet a long moment. Then he laughs.

THOR starts BARKING FURIOUSLY downstairs.
Janet throws down the papers.

JANET
What the HELL--?

Janet leaps out of bed, pissed off, and leaves the room.

Janet bursts downstairs. Thor is up on his hind legs, pawing
at the door. He BARKS and BARKS URGENTLY.
,
JANET
THOR!

Thor refuses to stop barking. He puts his paws up on the
window of the back door, as if to show Mom what's out there.

JANET
ALRIGHT ALREADY!

The dog recoils, then BARKS in true alarm to Mom. Janet goes
for Thor's choker collar, but the German Shepherd backs away,
BARKING and BARKING. Baffled, Janet ldéoks out the window but
sees only woods and hears, of course, nothing.

JANET
I don't see anything out there, Thor!

On the second floor landing, Brett starts down the stairs.

JANET
Brett, go back to bed!

Excited, Brett keeps going downstairs anyway.

Janet befuddledly looks at her BARKING dog, and her alarmed
family, and simply doesn't know what to do.

ground. He leaps up, putting his paws on the back door

Thor bolts out the door.

EXT. BACK YARD ~- HARRISON HOUSE - NIGHT 67

Thor charges across the silvery, moonlit grass, leaps the
little creek that separates the yard from the woods, and
vanishes into the trees.

INT. WOODS - NIGHT 68

The German Shepherd puts his nose to the trail, sniffing. He
slows to a trot, picking up Uncle Ted's scent. The woods
are dark, much darker than the yard. The moon is low in the
sky and very little moonlight penetrates the tall, dense pine
trees.

Thor stops. Lifts his head. Perks his ears.

THOR P.O.V.: B&W. HIS NIGHT VISION IS GOOD, AND HE SEES THE
THICK BRANCHES AND ENDLESS WALLS OF TREES WITH DIM, IF
PRISTINE CLARITY. THE FOREST IS PRETERNATURALLY QUIET, AS IF
THE ANIMALS INHABITING IT ARE FRIGHTENED TO TENSE,
ANTICIPATORY SILENCE...THEN HE HEARS, FROM WAY IN THE FOREST,
THE THROATY WOLFISH RUMBLING OF THE BAD THING...AND THE
METALLIC CLINKING.

And follows it.

He stops. Tenses. Hackles up. Expecting an ambush. None
is forthcoming.

Thor braces for combat.

and pushes into the clearing.

INT. CLEARING - WOODS - NIGHT 69
The branches part...

And Thor is face to face with A WEREWOLF.

It is handcuffed to a big tree.

Though it is manlike in size and build, it is hideously
unnatural. The Werewolf's face and body are completely
covered with thick patches of black pubic-like hair. Covered
with fur, it stands upright, on its hind legs, with its front
legs wrapped around the tree trunk, held together by Uncle
Ted's handcuffs. It wears Uncle Ted's sweatpants and the
ragged remains of his sweatshirt, and a small metal object
dangles from a chain around its neck. The key to the
handcuffs. Its face distends in a wolf-like snout. Two

-grotesquely long fangs protrude from its exposed gums. Its

fangs are sharp and very dangerous-looking. It has been
trying to cut through the tree trunk with them, and has
gnawed a big hunk out of the tree before giving up on the
idea.

The Werewolf hasn't seen Thor yet.

The German Shepherd backs slowly, silently, into the
surrounding bushes, then edges in for a closer look.

The Werewolf is chained to the lone tree in the clearing, and
the moon, now high in the sky, beams down on it like a
spotlight. The creature's attention is torn between the
moon and the handcuffs that bind it. It struggles awhile,
tires, then gazes upward. It glowers at the moon, its face a
picture of hate. The only sound that comes from the
Werewolf is the same constant LOW GROWL Thor had heard in the
distance.

The German Shepherd watches the creature with a mixture of
apprehension and befuddlement. Thor sniffs the ground and
locates one of Uncle Ted's sneakers. He sniffs it, looks at
the Werewolf, and a WHINE of confusion escapes his throat.

The Werewolf hears him and snaps his head around to see the
interloper.

At the sight of Thor, the Werewolf flies into a mad rage.

Thor tenses and bares his teeth, ready to fight, but the
handcuffs restraining the creature hold. The Werewolf can't

attack. Instead, it twists itself around the tree to face
Thor, snarling, growling, pulling at the handcuffs, and
snapping at the air the whole time. The Werewolf's fury
makes it foam at the mouth, and despite its helpless state,
it shows no fear, only rage. Even helpless, locked to the
tree, it urges Thor closer, wanting any opportunity to try to
kill him.

It is utterly mad.
Their eyes meet.
Thor freezes.

The Werewolf's eyes are neither canine nor human, but
resembling both.

Its psychotic, anarchic gaze seems to beckon to Thor,
inviting him to join the Werewolf in its wildness, in its
freedom, in its madness...its power te kill. Thor stares as
if hypnotized, struggling against the primal seduction of raw
animal bloodlust.

The German Shepherd shakes to his very bones, unable to break
the creature's gaze.

THE HIGH, SHRILL SOUND OF A DOG WHISTLE PIERCES ‘THOR'’S tARS.
And snaps the hold the Werewolf has over hin.

Regaining his senses, Thor BARKS SAVAGELY, FURIOUSLY at the
shackled creature.

JANET O.S.
THOR! HERE, THOR!

The Werewolf hears Mom. It turns to look in the direction of
a flickering flashlight beam. Its eyes gleam with an insane
lust that sends a ripple of terror through Thor.

JANET 0.S.
THOR! HERE, THOR! THOR!

Thor throws a glance in Mom's direction. Janet is getting
closer. The dog turns one last time to the Werewolf, and
bares his teeth in warning. Then he hurries off through the
clearing to stop Mom.

When the Werewolf sees that Thor is leaving, it explodes. It
opens its mouth wide, issuing a loud, voiceless, hateful
hiss. It thrashes its head and shoulders from side to side in
mindless fury, frantically trying to break the handcuffs or
the tree itself. The handcuffs cut into its wrists. It

bites the tree trunk with its teeth again. It takes as much
of the trunk into its jaws as it can, then lifts its hind
legs and kicks against the tree like a cat. Bark, spit, and
blood fly.

JANET V.O.
THOR! GET OVER HERE, THOR!

A flashlight beam flickers through the tree branches.
Thor stops and looks over his shoulder at the Werewolf.

Seeing it will not escape, he abandons the clearing and heads
for the flashlight and the sound of Mom's voice.

INT. WOODS - NIGHT . - 70
Thor trots briskly through the trees towards the flickering
flashlight beam. .
JANET .
_ THOR!

Mom is ahead on the path.

Thor approaches her deferentially, head, ears, and body low,
tail wagging apologetically between his legs. Janet stands
waiting for him in her bathrobe and slippers, hands on her
hips.

A leash dangling from her wrist. .

Thor ducks his head, deferring to her.

Mom puts the leash on Thor's choker collar, and with a tug,
pulls him back with her through the woods towards the house.

INT. KITCHEN - HARRISON HOUSE - NIGHT 71

Janet brings the dog in the house and unhooks the leash. She
holds the pooch's head in both hands, forcing the dog to look
at her.

JANET
There. Is. Nothing. Out. There.

Thor looks up at Mom with wet eyes, so confused, so
frustrated, by his inability to communicate. He WHIMPERS
dismally. Janet squeezes the sides of his face fondly,
comically scrunching the dog's features.

Thor sits-by the door. 7
His ears perk.

He looks out the window to spot Uncle Ted staggering out of
the forest, wearing only his running pants. He carries the
handcuffs in his fist. Seeing the coast is clear, he hurries
across the lawn. As he reaches the Airstream, he turns to
gee Thor watching him through the kitchen window.

They lock eyes.
And Uncle Ted slips into his trailer, locking the door.
The dog watches, baffled. Mom's footsteps behind him.

JANET
Well, if it isn't Canine Non Gratis.

Mom is obviously tired from lack of sleep, as she leans down
and scratches the German Shepherd's head. Thor is exhausted
from his all night vigil. Janet leans down and berates him
sarcastically.

JANET
Good MORNING Thor. How are you TODAY?

Janet starts throwing some bacon on a skillet. Thor looks at

the floor near Janet's feet. Brett, dressed in p.j.'s, comes
downstairs. He smiles at the dog, who behaves like he is in,

is perusing the comic section of the Sunday paper. Janet
stares comic daggers down at Thor, who still nervously
anticipates the verdict from the Spanish Inquisition.

basks in relief to feel Mom's hand loving him again. His
tail pounds against Janet's chair as she pats his chest. He
rolls over and offers his underside to Janet, who strokes his
chest and stomach deliciously.

Thor is back in the fold.

Janet goes back to the stove, switching on the television as
she makes breakfast. A local news program is on. Footage of

Janet cooks. Uncle Ted sits down. Thor takes a protective
position between them. Brett is watching "Werewolf of

television showing Henry Hull as he stares nervously at the
full moon hovering in the sky. He stares in horror at the
bad special effects on his hand, growing hairy. Uncle Ted

Thor walks up to Janet, looks her straight in the eye, and
BARKS a few times in an attempt to convey the seriousness o
the mission. Mom doesn't get it. Obviously concerned abou
the dog's strange behavior, Janet takes a deep breath and
speaks patiently.

JANET
Get in here.

Thor climbs the steps into the kitchen and sits down with a
disgusted GRUNT.

window, Uncle Ted runs for the woods as if the Devil himse.

What's with you?

She scratches the dog. Thor looks up at her with pleading
eyes.

JANET
You be a Good Dog, alright?

Mom pets Thor gently. Thor WHINES for a second, then gives
up.

Mom goes upstairs to bed.
Thor gets up and looks through the window.

THOR AUDIO P.O.V.: THE LOW HORRIFIC GROWL OF THE WEREWOLF.
DISTANT, BUT...COMING CLOSER.

Thor WHINES, but swallows his bark. .
He hears something in the house.

' Thor whirls, bracing in alarm.
It's Brett.

BRETT
What's wrong, boy?

Thor jumps his paws up on the kitchen door, scratching the
glass. Thor seems torn with trying to'warn Brett back from
the approaching danger, and trying to get out.

 

BRETT
You wanna go OUT?

Thor leaps off the kitchen door, WHINING and fidgeting
uncontrollably while he waits for Brett to open it.

BRETT
Sure, boy.

Brett's hand turns the knob. As soon as an inch of space
appears, Thor wedges in his snout and shoves his body through
the door. Before Brett can regain his balance, Thor has
crossed the yard and disappeared into the woods.

THOR P.O.V.: B&W. MOVING THROUGH THE TALL PINE TREES,
SNIFFING ON THE SOUNDTRACK, NOSE TO THE TRAIL...

Thor sees Uncle Ted's running clothes, torn to shreds.
Trotting further, he sees the sneakers, also ripped up.
Thor stops.

On the ground glints something metallic...

The handcuffs.

Thor bolts upright with a YELP of alarm, his head swiveling
back towards the house. He takes off in a dead, desperate
run back for the house like the ground was on fire. The

forest flies past him in a dark blur. .

The German Shepherd bursts out of the Woods, bounding across
the stream onto--

EXT. BACK YARD - HARRISON HOUSE - NIGHT 80
The Werewolf is at the edge of the yard.

Thor BARKS savagely.

He leaps straight for the Werewolf's throat.

The creature's foot sweeps up and kicks Thor in the ribs,
slamming him sideways into a tree.

The dog hits the ground.

The Werewolf kicks its half-canine, half-human leg up into
Thor's jaw, smashing him against another tree and bouncing
him off the ground.

THOR P.O.V.: B&W. BLURRY. OUT OF FOCUS WITH PAIN. THE
WEREWOLF COMING AT HIM WITH TALONS EXTENDED.

Thor staggers to his feet.
The Werewolf picks him up by the throat and bares its

Shepherd's head off.

Janet bursts out of the bedroom, hearing the commotion

outside. She runs to the wall and throws a security system
switch.

EXT. HARRISON HOUSE - NIGHT . 82
A special set of security system floodlamps pop on in a

bright flare of light.

EXT. BACKYARD - HARRISON HOUSE - NIGHT 83

With a howl of agony, the Werewolf slams its sensitive eyes
shut from the piercing glare of the floodlights.

The monster recoils from the sudden flood of light. Its face
is bathed in the glare. Saliva smearg the creature's mouth.

Startled by the house lights, the Werewolf drops Thor and
dashes for the creek and the sheltering shadows of the
forest.

Thor shakes his head clear.

THOR P.O.V.: B&W. PICTURE COMING INTO FOCUS. THE WEREWOLF
STAGGERING FOR THE FOREST.

Thor charges, targeting the Werewolf's trailing ankle.

The Werewolf gets to the creek.

Thor's head shoots out, his jaws viciously snapping at the
retreating ankle. His teeth clamp shut on flesh and he tears
some off.

Blood spurts.

The Werewolf lets out a subdued yelp as Thor falls back on
the other side of the creek. The creature twists and swings
a clawed hand at Thor's nose, nicking it. It glances
hatefully at Thor for the briefest instant before dashing
across the creek into the deep shadows of the forest.

Thor gasps for breath.

Thor stands by the fence, BARKING and BARKING in warning. The
Harrison house lights are turning on. The back door opens
and Mom steps out holding a flashlight, still half asleep.

JANET
Who's out here!

Thor runs over to block her way, BARKING URGENTLY, trying to
back Janet into the house. She walks outside, shining the
flashlight around. Thor BARKS FURIOUSLY, and tries to block
Mom's way, keeping one eye out for therWerewolf. Janet
doesn't even slow down, merely acts annoyed. Janet keeps
scouting the back of the house with.the flashlight. Thor's
shepherding instincts are in full command. He runs in front
--of Mom and BARKS to warn her off. It only annoys Janet
further. Janet shines the flashlight on Thor. She gasps as
she sees the speckles of blood on his snout. She kneels down
and touches the cut on his nose. -

JANET
What happened, Thor?

Janet is terribly concerned as she shihes the flashlight on
Thor's coat and sees the multitude of scratches and cuts.

JANET
Hey, boy, what did this to you? How did
you get cut?
The dog looks straight ahead, haunted. Thor WHIMPERS.
JANET
Was it another dog? No, it wasn't that.
Was it a rat, or a raccoon? A person?
The dog doesn't react.

Brett comes to the top of the stairs.

Janet shoots him a glance.

Brett is barely able to hold back tears.

The little boy pulls the covers up around his chin, his
breathing rapid and shallow.

JANET
Whatever it was, it wasn't a Werewolf.

BRETT
It...it was hairy all over, and it had
long teeth. But...it looked like a man.

Janet sees the Werewolf model kit on Brett‘s dresser. She
picks it up and shows it to him.

JANET “
Did it look like this one? |

BRETT
-Kind of. But the ears were tonger. And
it had a longer snout. And it...I think
it had more hair. That one's just from a

movie.

JANET
I see. You sure you weren't having a bad
dream? i
BRETT

NOt ZI went to the bathroom, and I heard
something, and I looked out the window,
and the Werewolf came toward the house.
Then Thor came and fought with him and
chased him away.

Janet suppresses a smile. She looks at her boy and rubs her
tired eyes.

JANET _
Are you sure this Werewolf wasn't Thor?

BRETT
No, Mom! Thor was in the woods! He came
back after the Werewolf tried to get in
the house! He chased him through the

Well, look. As long as Thor chased him
away, we're safe, right? And Thor is in
the house now, so I'm sure if there is a
Werewolf out there, he won't try
anything. We can figure this out
tomorrow, okay?

Janet tousles the boy's hair and gets off the bed. She goes
to the door. Dog tired.

BRETT

Mom?
JANET

Yeah, sweetheart? .
BRETT .

Could you leave the door open a crack?

JANET
Sure. Go to sleep, Brett.

Janet departs, leaving the door open a few inches.

The boy lies in bed.

In a moment, the familiar protective pad of paws on the
carpet, and Thor peers through the crack in the door. The
big German Shepherd wedges open the door with his nose. He
crosses the room and stands by Brett's bed. The little boy
pets him.

BRETT
We know, don't we, Thor?

Thor climbs onto the bed and lies down beside Brett, putting

his body between the boy and the door. Reassured by Thor's
presence, Brett drops to sleep.

Then she sees something on the desk. An open folder. A pile
of snapshots. Marjorie. Janet picks up one of the
snapshots. And sees the others...The self-timed photo of
Uncle Ted and Marjorie they shot in Nepal. Janet cannot
resist flipping through them. Marjorie was a looker.

JANET
Nice. .
Then she sees the next picture...And chokes back vomit.
Marjorie's savaged, mutilated remains, shot during daylight
hours in the Nepal forest.

JANET
Ohhhhh, my God.

There's more. A mauled dead Native Guide. Janet stares at
Marjorie's corpse in horrified fascination.

as he sees the Werewolf face to face, its jagged fangs
spilling saliva, its hot, fetid breath condensing in air.
Flopsy regards the Werewolf blankly.

FLOPSY
Bullfuckingshit.

He raises the cleaver. With a powerful swipe of its razor
talon, the Werewolf rips off Flopsy's knife hand at the
wrist. The man's eyes bug out as he sees his blood-gouting
severed stump.

He is about to scream.

A second swipe of the Werewolf's talon detaches his larynx
with the better part of his throat.

The creep tries to run for it. He gets two feet.

The Werewolf swipes it's talon, tearing a gaping cavity in
the man's torso and heaving him through the air.

His name was Walter Mills. -I hit him in
my patrol car tonight, respending to your
call. He ran out into the middle of the

But the thing of it is, the car isn't
what killed him. He bore the marks of an
animal attack. He had been torn open.
By a big animal. Like a wolf. Or...

Janet holds the Sheriff's gaze.

JANET
Or a dog, is that it?

SHERIFF JENSON
Yes, Ma'am. I do recall you told me that
Thor almost took a bite out of Mills the

SHERIFF JENSON
Yes, Janet. I'm in daily contact with
the Skyline Law Enforcement people.
We're keeping a watch on the paths of the
killings. But that wouldn't be the same
animal that killed Mills. It would have
had to travel two hundred miles from
Skyline to get here and-- .

JANET
No, that's not it. My question is... Is
‘there any possibility that the killings
were committed by a...human being?

Sheriff Jenson shakes his head.

SHERIFF JENSON
No chance at all, Janet. They were done
by a big animal. No man could tear a
person apart the way the beast that
butchered those people did. ' Same with
Mills tonight. Wolves are the probable
culprits. Very, very big wolves. But
not a man. Not humanly possible. Why do
you ask?

I don't know.

Janet ponders, most uneasy. Sheriff Jenson grabs his hat.

I reckon that's all for now, Janet.
We'll be in touch. Just one thing. I

Thor blinks. Puts his head on his paws with a dismal

Then...

JANET
Thor.

Thor doesn't lift his head, deeply despondent.

JANET
Thor.

Thor opens his eyes. The door has cracked open at the top
of the stairs.

JANET
Come here, Thor. It's okay, boy. I said
come here. Thor. It's okay, boy.

Thor rises weakly to his feet.
JANET '
Come on, Thor. t

His tail between his legs, Thor takes a tentative step
forward, his head lowered. He walks to the steps. Mom
stands at the top of the steps, her face beckoning the dog
softly.

Thor gets to the top step.

He doesn't see the white sneakers until too late.

POUND MAN #1 throws a choke chain around Thor's throat,
attached to a long pole. POUND MAN #2 throws another choke
chain over the dog's head. Thor regards the men in the white
uniforms in bewilderment, then in horrific realization.
Thor throws a terrified glance at Janet, who regards him with
huge sadness.

JANET
I'm sorry, boy.

POUND MAN #1
Come on, big guy.

The men in the white uniforms start pulling Thor towards the
front door. Thor weakly and submissively lets himself be
pulled by the demeaning choke chains. The Pound Men lead the
big German Shepherd out the door.

EXT. HARRISON HOUSE - DAY 113
A large unmarked white van is parked at the curb, its back
doors open. Thor is pulled by the white uniformed men across
the patio towards the van. The dog WHIMPERS and WHINES
miserably.

Thor looks over his shoulder as the house recedes behind him.
He sees Mom, and Brett. The little boy is crying.

BRETT
MOMMY, DON'T LET THEM TAKE THOR! PLEASE!

Janet bites back tears, but she holds her boy firmly.

BRETT

Thor tugs against the choke chain, his eyes welling as he
sees the little boy reaching for him. Brett tries to go
towards Thor, but Janet emotionally holds him back.

JANET
Brett! Stay here! They have to take
Thor! He's dangerous!

BRETT
NO IT'S NOT TRUE IT'S NOT TRUE HE'S A
GOOD DOG AND THEY'RE GOING TO KILL HIM
THEY'RE GOING TO KILL HIM IF THEY TAKE

An anguished Janet holds her grief-stricken boy back. Thor
tugs against the leash as the attendants hustle him towards
the van.

Thor BARKS. Then his eyes widen...

Uncle Ted steps out of the front door. His eyes on fire.
Something scary, strange, and inhuman flickers in his eyes.
He flashes a sickening grin to the dog as he watches the
animal taken towards the van to the pound. Uncle Ted comes
up behind Mom and Brett and puts his arms around them
possessively. He waves his fingers dismissively at the dog.
Thor goes out of his mind. Suddenly, he leaps and BARKS and
BARKS and HOWLS, trying to warn the family. The chain gags
him and cuts his air, but he thrashes against it. The Men In
The White Uniforms struggle fiercely with the huge German
Shepherd as they try to haul him in the van. Brett is
screaming hysterically in his mother's grip.

BRETT
THORI!! THOR!!! THORII!

Thor BARKS and BARKS. Louder as he sees the “pack" walk
dejectedly into the house.

Uncle Ted lingers in the doorway.
He waves "bye bye” at the dog.

INT. KITCHEN - HARRISON HOUSE - NIGHT 119

The family is finishing dinner. A tense silence hangs over
the table. Uncle Ted has his arm bandaged. Janet looks at
him evenly, keeping a discreet but cool eye on him. She
edgily gets up and clears the dishes.

UNCLE TED

It's probably genetic. It happens with

German Shepherds sometimes. The way

they're bred.
Brett, who has remained cold and expressionless, shoots his
Uncle an icy glance.

. BRETT ‘

Thor's pedigreed. It doesn't happen with

pedigreeds. :

Janet shoots Brett a glance. He shuts up, but his mind is
working behind his eyes. Uncle Ted looks uncomfortably
around at the obviously despondent child. He looks more
uncomfortably out the window at the gathering dusk.

JANET ;
You'll need to see a doctor.

UNCLE TED
No, I won't. It's just a flesh wound.
No veins or tendons cut. Nothing I can't
handle.

JANET
You're going to need a tetanus shot.

UNCLE TED
I'll give myself a tetanus shot. You

He pauses, ruefully.

Besides, I don't like doctors.

Janet finds her brother's tone most disturbing.

JANET

She leaves the room.

Uncle Ted looks at Brett, as the boy picks absently with his
food.

UNCLE TED .
Listen, son. I'm really sorry about your
dog.
The boy doesn’t look at him. .

Come here. ‘

The boy looks up. Uncle Ted gestures with his hand.

UNCLE TED
Sit on my lap.

Brett hesitates. Then he sulkily goes over and sits on his
the man's lap. Uncle Ted smiles and strokes the boy's hair.
He speaks softly, something strange and spooky behind his
eyes.

UNCLE TED
There'll be other animals in your life.

Brett looks up and locks eyes with Uncle Ted.

Janet's hand removes Ted's hand from her boy's head. She
lifts him off her brother's lap.

JANET
Okay, Brett, time for bed.

The little boy heads up the stairs with a sense of mission.

Uncle Ted looks out the window at the darkening skyline and
rises from the table.

Janet shuts her eyes, grimly.

The boy puts his jacket on.

He quietly lifts open the window.

Brett carefully climbs onto the big tree next to the house

He tiptoes to his bike leaning against the porch.

Uncle Ted closes the trailer door behind him. He stares up
at the moon in the clear, starry sky with crawling dread.
Perspiration glistens on his forehead. The handcuffs CLINK

on her flashlight.

Janet trains the flashlight beams through the heavy, fog-

by the torch. She moves cautiously through the trees,
looking this way and that for Uncle Ted.
No sign of him.

Mom moves on. Deeper into the huge forest.

kind of inner struggle. Becomes suddenly penitent.

beginning to crack.

THOR P.O.V.: HURTLING THROUGH THE SMASHED KITCHEN DOOR AND
UP THE STAIRS ONTO THE SECOND FLOOR LANDING WHERE THE
WEREWOLF IS HEAVING ITSELF BODILY AGAINST BRETT'S BEDROOM
DOOR. THE DOOR CAVES IN.

INT. BRETT'S BEDROOM - HARRISON HOUSE - NIGHT 148

The door splinters and the Werewolf comes toppling into the
room and onto the floor. It quickly leaps to its feet and
rises to its full height above Janet cowering on the bed. Mom
screams hysterically. The Werewolf steps towards her...

Thor bounds into the room, leaping onto the Werewolf's back,
his jaws snapping at the thing's neck. He bites a chunk out.
Blood sprays the ceiling.

JANET .
THOR!

Janet stares in astonishment, clutching the gun.

A German Shepherd is a big and powerfully dangerous animal,
and Thor shows it as he clings onto the Werewolf's back and
rips his claws into the monster's body. The creature howls
and hurls Thor off. Not for long. Thor dives with a SAVAGE
SNARL for the stunned Werewolf’s throat. The creature dives

at him, sinking its fangs deep into Thor’s thigh. Thor whips
his head around and snaps at the Werewolf's face, catching
its nose in his fangs and tearing one nostril open. The
Werewolf pulls away with its teeth still in Thor's flesh,
opening a long gash in the dog's leg. Thor scrambles to his
feet and leaps at the Werewolf's face, ready to bite any part
of the beast that comes within reach.

The Werewolf is tall and powerful, but not fast. It tries to
swipe at Thor with its claws and gets a finger severed off.

The creature backs into a corner and Thor lunges for its
ankles. The Werewolf manages a wild kick in Thor's rib cage
that sends him flying clear across the room and bouncing off
awall. Thor drops to the floor, stunned and hobbling.

THOR P.O.V.: ROOM SWIMMING. WEREWOLF APPROACHING, LIPS
SPILLING MUCUSY SALIVA.

WEREWOLF P.Q.V.: ADVANCING ON THOR, THEN SWIVELLING ITS HEAD
TO SEE MOM.

Instead of-closing in for the kill, the Werewolf turns and
leaps at Mom, who has finished loading the pistol in her
hand. ,

She is face to face with the Werewolf, but she looks in its
eyes and sees the eyes of her brother. Janet aims the gun
point blank at the Werewolf's head but cannot bring herself
to pull the trigger.

JANET i
TEDDDY!!!

The creature SNARLS and flails its arm, sending the gun
flying across the room.

Thor gets to his feet as the pistol clatters to the floor and
lunges at the monster.

Going for its balls.

The Werewolf swivels its hips and kicks its leg, hitting the
German Shepherd a pile driver blow to the jaw. Thor crashes
down on a bedstand, taking a lamp to the floor. The Werewolf
makes a dash for the door, but Thor snags its ankle. The
creature swings around and kicks him in the ribs, following
with a sharp kick to Thor's head. The German Shepherd's
front legs give out from under him.

THOR P.O.V.: EVERYTHING GOING BLACK, AND OUT OF FOCUS.
WEREWOLF BENDING OVER HIM, RAZOR TEETH BARED, MOM BEHIND IT,
THINGS FADING OUT.

WEREWOLF P.O.V.: REARING OVER THOR, ITS TALONS REACHING FOR
THE FALLEN DOG'S NECK.

Brett bursts into the room.

He freezes in paralyzed shock when he sees the real live
Werewolf standing five feet in front of him.

The creature scoops the little boy up in its talon. It
stretches its jaws on its snout to bite half of Brett's head
off.

KA-POW! POW! POW!

The Werewolf suddenly rears up in anguish.

Mom FIRES the .38 revolver into its back again and again.

- JANET -
GET THE FUCK OFF MY KID!!!

The Werewolf drops Brett on the carpet. It swings around, to

face Janet, squirming from the bullets in its back. The
creature is standing by the bedroom window.

Janet takes point blank aim between the Werewolf's eyes with
the gun.

And squeezes the trigger.
The CLICK of an empty chamber. She's out of bullets.

Her face falls as the creature lunges at her. She knows
she's dead.

Thor's eyes narrow...

THOR P.O.V.: THE WEREWOLF IN FRONT OF THE WINDOW.
The dog SNARLS.

And leaps.

Thor lands full body on the Werewolf, taking them both out
the window in an explosion of glass and wood pane.

EXT. HARRISON HOUSE - NIGHT 149
The dog and the Werewolf go flying out the window in a

raining debris of glass and wood. They fall two stories onto

the grass with a heavy thud. They lie nearby each other,

stunned and wounded.

Thor's eyes blink open.

The Werewolf, covered with blood and torn fur, stumbles to
its feet, licking its many wounds.

The German Shepherd growls.
And rises.

The Werewolf hisses weakly. Spitting, it staggers away from
Thor across the back yard. It is retreating for the woods.

Thor, injured himself, limps after ite,

The creature makes it to the creek, picking up speed.

Thor charges with his remaining strength across his path,

through the creek, and into the woods after the Werewolf.

EXT. FOREST - NIGHT 150
The mortally wounded Werewolf staggers aimlessly past the
trees...Its dog-like haunches begin to transform back to

human legs...Its extended spine beginsito return to human
proportions...Its matted hair retracts into its skin...The
wolf-like snout reforms into a human jaw..

Soon it is only the mauled, bullet-ridden Uncle Ted stumbling
through the woods.

EXT. WOODS - NIGHT 151

THOR P.O.V.: NOSE TO THE TRAIL. SNIFFING. THE SOUND OF THE
WEREWOLF CLOSE AT HAND.

Thor stops.
Lifts his head.

Sniffs.
-THOR--P.O.V.: THE WOODS WILD AND DENSE. ON THE SOUNDTRACK,
THE LOW, PAINED GROWLING OF THE WEREWOLF CHANGES, BECOMING
HEAVY, RAGGED, HUMAN BREATHING. THE THUNDEROUS HEARTBEAT OF
THE WEREWOLF BECOMES WEAKER, SMALLER, HUMAN. NEAR. VERY
NEAR. FOOTSTEPS CRACKING TWIGS.

Thor turns his head.

Uncle Ted steps out of the forest. His face and torso are
covered with open, bleeding wounds. He looks ready to die on
the spot. Uncle Ted leans against a tree for support. Thor
creeps towards him slowly and silently, his eyes locked on
the man's throat.

Uncle Ted stares blearily into space. He is unaware of
Thor's presence. .

The German Shepherd inches closer in the shadows. To fifteen
feet away. .

Uncle Ted finally sees him. He chuckltés nihilistically.

- UNCLE TED .
Thor! How ya doin', old buddy.

Thor stops and regards the shadowy form. They face off for a
final time. .

UNCLE TED
Guess I've been a Bad Dog, huh?

Uncle Ted locks eyes with Thor. i

UNCLE TED
Do it.

Thor goes for his throat.

EXT. HARRISON HOUSE - DAY 152

A bright, sunny day. WORKMEN on a scaffold repair Brett's
bedroom window. PAINTERS are finishing the touchups by the
replaced kitchen door.

The Airstream is gone.

INT. CELLAR - HARRISON HOUSE - DAY 153
Janet walks down the steps.

Thor lies in the corner, bandaged.

A steak, untouched, is in front of him.

He apparently hasn't eaten for days, ahd his bones stick out.
His manner is weak and listless, as if his will to live is
gone. :

Janet crouches down beside Thor. She tries to stroke the
German Shepherd, but the dog shrinks away, like a leper.

JANET
You gotta eat, big guy. You're the man
of the house, and we need you to be big
and strong.

Thor looks away, as if he feels he is not worth living. As
if he wishes he was never born. Mom's eyes well up. She
takes a piece of the steak and tries to put it to Thor's
mouth, but the dog will not open his teeth.

JANET
You saved us, fella. You're our hero. I
know you think you're a Bad Dog because
you bit a person and I always told you
that that's what Bad Dogs do, but this
was different. Ted, he was different.
He wasn't really a man, anymore. He was
an animal, a sick animal, and he was
going to hurt us. I think he knew you
knew what he was and he...he wanted you
to stop him...

Janet tries to force feed Thor. Thor won't open his mouth.
Mom physically pulls the dog into her arms. Janet starts to
cry. On the upstairs landing, Brett is watching. Teary
eyed. He comes down the stairs and hunkers down next to Mom,
by Thor. ° .

JANET
I'm sorry Thor. Tf didn't understand that
you were doing your job and trying to
protect us, because just like you don't
understand things that people know, we
don't understand things that...dogs know.

Mom and son huddle over their family pet.

JANET
You aren't a Bad Dog, Thor. You're a
Good Dog. Do you hear me, you're a Good
Dog. A Good Dog, Thor.

Thor shows a spark of life as he huddles in the shadows . He
lets Janet pat him.

JANET
A Good Dog.

Janet lets the tears come. r

. BRETT
That's a boy. Good Dog.

Brett pats the dog, and Thor lets them: A wave of happiness
and relief sweeps across the family as they huddle
protectively over their dog, who WHIMPERS as their hands
stroke him with their tender, familiar touch.

JANET
Good Dog... ;

Thor looks up.

HIS FEATURES HAVE HORRIFICALLY RESHAPED INTO A MONSTROUS
HALF-DOG WEREWOLF! HIS BLOODSHOT GAZE IS PSYCHOTIC,
ANARCHIC! ROWS OF RAZOR FANGS JUT IN A SALIVA-DRIPPING
SNOUT!

Janet and Brett never have time to scream.

As the Werewolf's gaping, salivating jaws LEAP AT THE CAMERA
AND WE...

Janet wakes up screaming from her nightmare, on the couch.

Brett runs into the room.

BRETT
MOMMY MOMMY WHAT'S WRONG? 11!

Thor, perfectly normal, jumps on the couch. The dog is
bandaged from his recent battles, as is Janet. The Workmen
are repairing the kitchen door. Thor stands protectively
over Janet and Brett, licking their faces. Janet relaxes,
gratefully embracing her son, and her family dog.

JANET

It's okay. It's okay. Everything's
going to be okay...

FADE OUT.
