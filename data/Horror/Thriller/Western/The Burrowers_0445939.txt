MARYANNE (V.O.)
Hold still.

INT. STEWART HOUSE - NIGHT

MARYANNE STEWART is twenty-two, she has a plain beauty to
her, freckles, hair gathered in a bun. Her face is underlit
by the candle she uses to heat a needle. She’s holding the
hand of her LITTLE BROTHER, age 6, about to remove a splinter
from his finger. She blows on the needle to cool it.

MARYANNE
A splinter already hurts more than
pulling it out.

Little Brother tries to be brave, but he’s nervous. Pinned
to her dress at Maryanne’s throat is a silver BROOCH, an
intricate Celtic pattern interwoven with a yellow ribbon.

In the small, rough-hewn cabin behind her, we see Maryanne’s
heavy-set BIG BROTHER (27), LITTLE SISTER (10), and MOTHER
(50’s.) They’re settling for the night, cleaning the dinner
dishes, getting the kids into their nightshirts, etc.

YOUNGER SISTER
I’m not sleepy.

MOTHER
We’ll story you to bed.
(to Maryanne-)
You need to take your rest, too,
Mary. F’you wanna look pretty when
your Dutchman comes courtin’
tomorrow.

MARYANNE
You hush.

Maryanne smiles, lowers the needle towards her brother's
finger...

BIG BROTHER
He told daddy he was saving wages
for his own settlement.
Little Brother squirms, watching the needle approach.

MARYANNE
I only just met him. He ain’t...

The pin-point approaches young skin...
CRACK, CRACK, CRACK, rapid rifle fire sounds from outside.
The whole family’s attention snaps towards the sound. They
freeze for a moment, spooked like animals.

Big Brother moves first, cracks the shutter on a window. In
silvery moonlight, we catch a glimpse of waving prairie
grass, MUZZLE-FLASHES with the CRACKS of rifle fire.

There’s a FIGURE, running, fast approaching the house.

Maryanne sticks the needle in the candle and puts a
protective arm around Little Brother. Little Sister nuzzles
into her mother’s arms, frightened.

LITTLE SISTER
Mom...?

BAM, everybody jumps when he hits the door, yanking it open a
moment later to reveal Maryanne’s heavy FATHER (50’s.) He’s
breathless, terrified, a rifle in his hand. CRACK, CRACK,
distant rifle-fire continues from the cabin behind him.

MOTHER
What’s happening?

FATHER (BREATHLESS)
They were in the Williams’ house.

BIG BROTHER
Indians?

Big Brother grabs a rifle off the wall, steps towards his
father, who puts a hand on his shoulder.

FATHER
Stay with the women. Down, into
the root cellar. Get.

EXT. WASHBURNE CRICK SETTLEMENT - NIGHT

The settlement is two small clapboard homes alone in an ocean
of grass stirred by heavy winds. From the Stewart House, we
see Maryanne and her family hurrying out of the back door and
down into a cellar.

INT. STEWART HOUSE CELLAR - NIGHT
Her father ushers Maryanne down the stairs, where her mother

and sisters wait with a lantern. Her brother follows after,
a rifle in hand. Father lifts the doors above-
FATHER
Keep your lamp low and this door
locked. You don’t open it no
matter what. You hear?

Brother nods as he shuts the door.

YOUNGER SISTER

Dad!

BROTHER
Quiet.

YOUNGER SISTER (PANICKING)
Mom, mom...

MOTHER
You mind your brother. Hush.

Big Brother latches the storm doors shut and backs into the
middle of the cellar. He takes the lamp from his mother and
turns the flame down low.

We hear muffled SHOUTS above, movement. The little children
in their white nightshirts are crying, holding onto their
mother. The adults all look up at the underside of the
floorboards, eyes glassy with fear.

Maryanne shakes her head at her Little Brother’s tears and
wipes at his cheek. In a whisper, barely more than silence-

MARYANNE
Don’t cry. Be brave for me.

She holds his gaze until he takes a breath, and nods.

The cellar around them is cluttered, filled with burlap sacks
of grain, half-mended farm tools. Lamplight throws weaving
shadows on the walls around them.

CRACK, CRACK, more rifle shots, and then a man’s SCREAM.
Maryanne puts a hand to her mouth. Brother tightens his fist
on the rifle. Mother holds the two crying children.

Relative SILENCE above. The family stands frozen, trying not
to breathe. Little Brother SNIFFS and all heads snap towards
the sound. Mother puts a gentle hand over his mouth, pleads

with her eyes for quiet.

Something DRAGS over the floorboards above. The family looks
upwards, terrified. SCCCCRRRRT, the dragging sounds like a
carpet knife over the rough boards.
BOOM, a muffled shotgun blast. Then BOOM, another. The
family all look upwards, from the dragging sound to- BOOM, a
third blast, and a fourth.

All of the adults fail to notice what both of the crying
children see- a silhouetted FIGURE in the shadows behind Big
Brother, low to the ground, moving in.

Little Brother and Sister draw tiny breaths, eyes fixed on
the figure, almost too terrified to speak.

YOUNGER SISTER (WHISPERING)
«..mom.

Her mother shushes her. The DRAGGING above has stopped.
Subtly, a dinner plate-sized circle of dirt by Little Brother
begins to move. He feels it through his socked foot and
looks. Eight inches of soil shake like simmering water.
Little Brother looks at his mom, who stares upwards at the
floorboards. He looks back down. Dirt moves outward from
the center of the circle. SOMETHING PALE begins to surface,
like a boiled worm, or the finger of a drowned child...
Maryanne, Big Brother, and Mother all stare upwards...

Little Brother looks down at the dirt and inhales to scream.

Little Sister looks away from the figure slinking towards Big
Brother and closes her eyes, crying, terrified.

An agonizing moment before-

Big Brother SCREAMS and the lantern drops.

Maryanne spins. The lantern hits the ground at her brother’s
feet and shatters, the momentary flash of firelight revealing
him clawing at the dirt floor as he’s pulled violently back
into the shadows...

The light extinguishes, leaving pitch darkness. Little
Sister SCREAMS. We hear YELLING. SCREAMS. VIOLENCE.

Then sudden quiet.

There are inhuman RATTLES and PURRS, the sounds of bodies
dragged over the ground. Soil shifts.

SILENCE. BLACK ON SCREEN.
TITLE
The Dakota Territories
August 15th, 1879

DRIPPING. Flies BUZZ.

A vertical line of light grows into the rectangle of an
opening door, silhouetting a FIGURE in a derby and duster
against the lush, slowly waving grass of the Dakota plains.

INT. THE WILLIAMS HOUSE- DAY

The figure moves into the absolute black of the house, stark
contrast against the big sky glare of the Badlands. He pulls
the derby from his head.

Hundreds of specks of darkness, FLIES, rise in a cloud and
swarm the lighted rectangle of the doorway.

The man, little more than a dark shape in the sliver of
light, is DUTCH, a heavily-accented Belgian immigrant two
years off the boat. Dutch is sharp, capable but out of
place, a little anxious in the West.

DUTCH (ACCENTED )
-..Is anybody home? Mr. Williams?
The Stewarts are...

The pupil in the illuminated crescent of Dutch's face widens,
adjusting to the dark, then narrows.

DUTCH
Jesus god.

Dutch backs away, his boots sliding through a rich, crimson
puddle, never taking his eyes off the thing before him.

At the door he puts his hand against the jamb, steadying
himself. There's something small and smooth under his palm.

He takes his hand away and looks. A TOOTH, a molar, lodged
in the wood as if fired there. Dutch stumbles out and...
EXT. WASHBURNE CRICK SETTLEMENT- DAY

-..onto the porch, nauseated, his blood-stained boots losing
purchase on the friction-smoothed boards. He flails and

falls into JOHN CLAY.

The enormous man catches Dutch. Clay is a mountain, early
40's, easily 6 feet and 250 lbs. of John Wayne.
All-business all the time, he’s a commanding presence,
strong, an obvious leader. He's holding a black-and-white
PHOTOGRAPH in a broken frame in one of his enormous hands.

CLAY
Basement’s empty. The Stewarts are
gone. Maryanne say anything to you
about leaving?

Dutch shakes his head, no. Clay presses the Stewart family
portrait into Dutch's hands and pushes him off the porch.

CLAY
What about the Williams?

Dutch shakes his head and points into the dark doorway before
them. Clay turns and steps into the Williams' House,
vanishing into the darkness.

We see the settlement in daylight, the two clapboard homes
bleached gray from hard weather. The surrounding grass sways.

We get a better look at Dutch: late 20’s, lean, angular. His
body language reads somewhere between Ichabod Crane and
Sherlock, contained nervous energy and remarkably sharp eyes.

Dutch looks at the photograph Clay gave him. The Stewarts
are a large family, posed before their home on the Washburne
Crick. The children’s images are blurred, they moved during
the exposure. Dutch scans the faces, focusing in on
Maryanne. He touches her image, smearing blood on the picture
by mistake. He grimaces and wipes it clean with his sleeve.

The TWO HORSES tied to the fence behind Dutch lift their feet
and roll their eyes, nervous.

Clay emerges from the door, carrying Dutch's Derby as if it
were a pair of discarded panties. Dutch takes the hat;
there's a crimson stain on the crown.

Clay walks to his horse and leans his hands on the saddle,
staring out at the slowly waving grass.

CLAY
Indians. God help them.

DUTCH
We have to get them back.

Clay nods, just barely.
EXT. THE SPACKS HOUSE- DAY

DOBIE SPACKS walks through the grass, looking down, lost in
rumination. He pinches at his upper lip, trying to tweeze
between his thumb and finger the fine down growing there.
Dobie will soon be 16. He carries a pitcher of milk. Behind
him, the Spacks House sits large, whitewashed, and Victorian,
like some Edward Hopper sentinel.

Ahead, WILLIAM PARCHER follows Dobie's mother towards a
thick, twisted box elder tree growing on a rise in the land.
Parcher is a mischievous-looking rancher in his 50's, a
moustache, glorious sideburns.

Parcher carries a picnic basket. He hangs back and whispers
conspiratorially to Dobie-

PARCHER

I hemped three men on yonder tree.
DOBIE

Really?
PARCHER

Indians, anyway. Hanged 'em dead.

Parcher winks at Dobie, showing off. The boy smiles, he’s
impressed.

GERTRUDE
Don't feed my boy your horse-shit,
Mr. Parcher.

GERTRUDE SPACKS, carrying a quilt, looks back at them. She's
in her early 50's, attractive, rich.

PARCHER
That ain't horse-shit, that's
history. Boy ought to learn where
we come from.

They arrive under the tree and Gertrude spreads the quilt.

GERTRUDE
Mind the cursing in front of my
boy.

They sit and Parcher begins to take food from the basket.
Dobie looks up at the sun through the gnarled branches of the
elder. We hear the CREAK of twisting ropes.
PARCHER
Great god amighty, is that coconut?

Parcher pulls a cake from the picnic basket.

DOBIE
Mom got it special.

GERTRUDE
I baked it. The coconut came from
back East.

Parcher looks at the cake, then at Gertrude.

PARCHER
Ten years back, not a mile from
here, I had to eat horse to
survive.

Dobie is impressed.

GERTRUDE
That's disgusting.

PARCHER
It wasn't my horse. Point is,
we're here now eating coconut cake.
Right civilized country.

Parcher cuts himself a slice that encompasses nearly a
quarter of the cake.

GERTRUDE
We have chicken and cornbread.

PARCHER
I know it. I'll attend to that
cornbread directly.

Parcher takes an enormous bite of cake, smearing his
moustache with icing.

DOBIE
There's a rider.

Dobie points. Parcher gets to his feet and squints. A MAN
ON A HORSE gallops towards them, half a mile away.

PARCHER
Listen, cowboy, how ‘bout taking
your mother in the house.
DOBIE
He's got a funny hat. I think it's
your ranch-hand, Mr. Dutch.

PARCHER
Anybody can wear a funny hat and
that ain't Sunday riding. Take
your mother inside.

GERTRUDE
Let's go, Dobie.

Parcher SNAPS the cover guard off of his revolver. Dobie
turns and looks. Parcher sees the boy eyeing the gun and
grins a little bit.

PARCHER
Go on.

Dobie and Gertrude hurry toward the house. Parcher, icing
smeared on his moustache, squints into the distance.
EXT. DAKOTA BADLANDS- DAY
We reveal the rider: Dutch. He drives his horse through the
knee-high grass towards Parcher, a half-mile distant.
EXT. THE SPACKS HOUSE- DAY
Dutch rears his frothing horse to a halt in the shade of the
box elder and dismounts a few feet from parcher. Dobie and
Gertrude are specks in the grass halfway back to the House.
PARCHER
Dutch, god damnit, I was having a
picnic.

DUTCH (BREATHLESS)
Indians. They killed... Here.

Dutch fishes a many-folded square of paper from his pocket
and hands it to Parcher. Scrawled in grease pencil-

“INDIAN MASSACRE AT WASHBURNER CRICK. WILLIAMS FAMILY DEAD.
STEWART FAMILY KIDNAPPED, 6 MISSING. FETCHING HENRY V.

- CLAY"
DUTCH

It's from Mr. Clay. They took
Maryanne... her whole family...
10.

PARCHER
I can read. Jesus. Indians kill
them little Williams girls, too?

DUTCH
Yes... no. Mr. Williams did. And
then, what is the word...

Dutch pantomimes shooting himself in the mouth.

PARCHER
Suicide.

Dutch points at Parcher, exactly.
INT. GERTRUDE'S PARLOR- DAY

Dutch thirstily drains a glass of water, jams his derby back
onto his head. The parlor is sparse, Victorian, dusty.

PARCHER
...If we're dealing with Crow or
Ute, Dobie could see things a boy
shouldn't have to.

Parcher perches on a stool, pulling on his boots. Gertrude
watches Dobie tie provision onto two horses outside.

GERTRUDE
I've made up my mind, Will.

PARCHER
You've already lost a man to the
Indians, I don't want to take
another.

GERTRUDE
I don't have a man in this house,
I've got a boy. You take him to
Washburne Crick and bring him back
and maybe I'll have two.

Parcher's pleased with this. Gertrude turns to Dutch.

GERTRUDE
Would you like more water?

Dutch shakes his head.

DUTCH
We have to go.
11.

Dobie enters from the front porch, dressed in brand-new
riding clothes. He's Christmas-morning excited.

DOBIE
The horses are ready.

PARCHER
Then let's get to it.

Gertrude takes Dobie's head, kisses his forehead.

GERTRUDE
Be good. Mr. Parcher’s lived
through everything this country
could throw at him. You stay close
and mind him, and you'll be fine.
(then, to Parcher-)
And you, too.

She kisses him lightly on the cheek. Parcher mugs pleased
shock before leaning to kiss her back. She shoves him off.

GERTRUDE
When you get back.

PARCHER
Yes, ma'am.

Parcher and Dobie eye each other significantly, both happy
and uncomfortable. Dutch puts down his empty water glass.

EXT. WASHBURNE CRICK- DAY

Dutch stands in the open doorway of the empty Stewart house,
looking in. The Williams house is open behind him, no sign
of Parcher or Dobie. Dutch walks around the house and
notices a SHADOW on the edge of the settlement, past the
barn, a dark circle in the grass. He walks over to it.

A CIRCULAR DEPRESSION about four feet across, the grass
pushed aside and collapsed, the earth beneath it churned.
Hundreds of ANTS crawl around in the soil.

Dutch crouches and presses his fingers into the circle. They
sink easily into the dirt.

INT. THE WILLIAMS HOUSE- DAY

In the dimmed light, Parcher and Dobie cover their mouths
with dust cloths. Out of focus, DEEP CRIMSON stains the walls
and ceiling behind them. Parcher crouches over MRS. WILLIAMS'
DEAD BODY-
12.

A matronly corpse, shotgunned. The neck and chest are roughly
buckshot-torn, her arm nearly separated. There's very little
blood, just the raspberry chew of the wound.

PARCHER
She should have bled out more.
Same with the girls.

DOBIE
Ida and Daphne... I think those
where their names.

Dobie can't help but glance through the doorway into the
girls' bedroom where lie-

The TWO DEAD WILLIAMS GIRLS. Small nightshirt-clad bodies
twisted in sheets torn and singed by buckshot. Remarkably
little blood. Child flesh chewed like ground chuck. Dobie
is close to retching. These are far from the first corpses
Parcher’s seen. Any concern he shows is for Dobie, almost
like a kind uncle.

PARCHER

You want to wait outside?
DOBIE

No.
PARCHER

Good. I wonder...

Parcher looks at a GASH in Mrs. Williams' neck, a good eight
inches above any shotgun damage. It's about an inch across
and six inches long. It sinks over half an inch into her
neck, but doesn't appear to have bled.

PARCHER
What kind of weapon makes a wound
like that? A chisel? Some kind of
wood plane?

As he talks, Dobie turns and looks at the source of all that
crimson behind them.

MR. WILLIAMS' HEADLESS CORPSE on the rough floorboards by the
fireplace, the shotgun he used to decapitate himself lying
between his curled hands.

And BLOOD. Unlike his wife and girls, there was no shortage
of the stuff inside Dad. It marks the wall and ceiling
behind him, Jackson-Pollock style.

Dobie stares at the twin barrel of the bloody shotgun.
13.

DOBIE
That gun only fires twice.
(Parcher waits for him)
...-He would have had to reload. To
kill everybody.

PARCHER
...If it was Appaches or Crow, any
Christian woman would prefer dying
to capture. If Mr. Williams had
time to reload, it's because his
wife gave it to him.

Dobie looks at the ground.

PARCHER
If it came to that, I hope you'd be
strong enough to take care of your
mother.

Dobie stares into the bedroom, at the little girls’ corpses.

DOBIE
Alright.

PARCHER
Our pity belongs to the Stewart
family, they're still alive and
captive...

DUTCH (0.S., INTERRUPTING)
Mr. Parcher! Mr. Clay's coming!

EXT. WASHBURNE CRICK, YARD- DAY
Dutch stares to the horizon. TWO DOZEN RIDERS approach.

Parcher and Dobie emerge from the Williams house. Parcher
uncorks some whisky and squints at the approaching riders.

PARCHER
He find Henry Victor?

DUTCH
Yeah, and near thirty bluecoats.

PARCHER
Mighty Christ. That cock-sure
little shit’s brought the whole
fort.

Dutch sees Dobie, his eyes red-rimmed and glassy. Dutch
touches the boy's shoulder.
14.

DUTCH
You alright?

PARCHER
Get off the boy, he's fine.

Dutch withdraws his hand. Parcher drinks some whisky.

DUTCH
I found something.

EXT. WASHBURNE CRICK, BEHIND THE BARN- DAY

Parcher, crouching before the circle, sinks his hand into the
softened earth up to his wrist. Dutch and Dobie hover behind
him. The two dozen RIDERS approach in the distance.

PARCHER
I s'pose... a wallowing buffalo
coulda done this.

He smells the dirt on his finger.

Clay, at the head of the dozen riders, reigns his horse to a
stop a few yards behind Parcher.

HENRY VICTOR stops his own horse beside him. He’s 40 years
old, a thin, tall dandy with a doughboy face and sharp,
arrogant eyes; the spoiled child of a Texan war hero. He
wears military blue and Lieutenant's stripes.

HENRY VICTOR
Looks like you found yourself a
hole in the ground, Will.

There’s an old rivalry between them. Parcher stands to face
the mounted men as a half dozen of H.V.'s BLUECOATS arrive
behind them. Parcher grins at the insult, brushing the ants
from his hand.

PARCHER
That and four corpses. And six
missing. Most of those being women
and children.

DUTCH
I’ll get the horses.

Dutch starts back towards the yard, H.V. stops him.
15.

HENRY VICTOR
Hold up now. This is my command, I
gotta know who we’re hunting. How
long have the Indians had them?

Clay looks annoyed at H.V.’s obvious, arrogant pleasure at
exercising authority.

The Bluecoats behind him are soldiers, between the ages of 15
and 30. Other Bluecoats ride into the settlement below.

PARCHER
Near a day now.

HENRY VICTOR
That's more than long enough for
those women to’ve been...

Dobie looks at Parcher, long enough for what? Dutch looks
sick with H.V.’s implication.

DUTCH
We should go. The longer we wait-

HENRY VICTOR
You want to go face an Indian war
party on your lonesome?

Dutch clenches his fists, looks to Clay for support. Clay
shakes his head, no.

HENRY VICTOR
You go off alone, those blanket
heads will peel you like an orange.

PARCHER
Maryanne is lukewarm on you with
your skin on, Dutch. Follow along,
we'll do this thing right.

HENRY VICTOR (TO PARCHER)
You think it's the Sioux?

PARCHER
I'd incline to guess Apache or
Commanche. Got a family suicide,
leads me believe the tribe'd have a
right smart reputation for torture.

HENRY VICTOR
The Sioux understand torture.
16.

His intonation almost sounds like a cruel, inappropriate
joke. At any rate, a few of the Bluecoats SNICKER.

EXT. WASHBURNE CRICK, YARD- DAY

Dutch, Parcher, and Clay stride quickly across the yard,
leading H.V. towards the Williams house.

Dutch eyes the approaching open door warily, a little sick.
It's so quiet that we can just hear the FLIES inside.

They pass a young black man leaning against the Williams'
house porch railing, "WALNUT" CALLAGHAN, (late 20's.)
Callaghan wears a worn bluecoat jacket, but the rest of his
clothes are catch-as-catch-can.

Dutch slows, he's not happy to be walking back into a
slaughterhouse.

Parcher, Clay, and H.V. pass the BLUECOAT LIEUTENANT standing
watch at the door and enter the Williams' house. Dutch
lingers on the porch. H.V. looks back at him.

HENRY VICTOR
Your Occidental isn't coming in?

Dutch shakes his head, close to puking. H.V. smirks and lets
the door shut.

Dutch walks back out into the dirt patch and puts his hands
on his knees. The nausea passes and he spits, looks out at
the horizon. Callaghan sits nearby.

CALLAGHAN
You alright, man?

DUTCH (SHAKING HIS HEAD)
We should be going after them.

CALLAGHAN
Did you know these people?

DUTCH
I do. I know the Stewarts.

Dutch removes the rolled-up photo of the Stewarts from his
vest and hands it to Callaghan. He points at Maryanne.

DUTCH
That’s Maryanne.

CALLAGHAN
She yours?
17.

Dutch shakes his head, no.

DUTCH
I was working on it.

EXT. WASHBURNE CRICK, LANDSCAPE- DAY

We see the small cluster of homes overrun with Bluecoats,
surrounded by an ocean of grass. We MOVE THROUGH the grass,
as if following something stalking the settlement...

EXT. WASHBURNE CRICK, THE WILLIAMS HOUSE- DAY

Dobie has joined Dutch and Callaghan by the porch. Dutch
finishes rolling a cigarette and hands it to the boy.

H.V. SLAMS the door of the Williams House open, startling
Dutch to his feet. Fuming, H.V. stalks across the porch,
says to the nearest Bluecoat-

HENRY VICTOR
Send a scout to Fort Lincoln. Tell
them to wagon up the gatlin and
meet us at the reservation.

DUTCH
Are we going?

CLAY (0.S.)
Not yet.

Clay and Parcher emerge from the house.

CLAY
Not till we put the Williams below
ground. I christened those little
girls, and I intend to give them a
Christian burial.

DOBIE
But the Stewarts are...

PARCHER
We go off on horses that ain’t been
rested, we won’t make it ten miles.
We got time for a burial.

Dutch clenches his fists, knows Parcher’s right. Dobie’s
edging towards his horse and Dutch stops him.

DUTCH
Let’s get the grain.
18.

Dutch turns to attend to the horses. As Dobie starts to
follow, Parcher takes the cigarette from him and smokes it.

PARCHER
No reason to route the heathen if
we're going to act like him.

EXT. WASHBURNE CRICK, GRAVES-— DAY

Two dozen BLUECOATS, Parcher, Dutch, Dobie, Callaghan, and
H.V. before four open graves. Clay, at the head-

CLAY
God tests us, and when he takes the
innocent, shows us we've failed.
Jesus on the mount said that the
meek would inherit the earth, and
there they are, down init. I
believe that was as much a
commandment as a beatitude.

Throughout the sermon, Dutch seems distracted, anxious to get
on the trail. He looks out at the plains.

CLAY
On that same mount, Jesus said,
"blessed are the peacemakers, for
they shall be called the children
of God." We need to be those
children. We got to work to make
the earth a fit place for the meek.
May God give the Williams family
peace and paradise where we could
not. And give us the wisdom and
perseverance to carry on until
we've finished His work. Amen.

ALL
Amen.

Clay looks at the crowd for a moment. Dutch puts on his hat,
ready to leave. The Bluecoats move to disperse.

Clay launches into a hymn, "Alas, and Did My Savior Bleed-"
Dutch takes his hat back off, the Bluecoats get back in line.

CLAY (SINGING)
Alas, and did my savior bleed,
And did my sovereign die.
Would he devote that sacred head,
For such a worm as I?
19.

The others join in. H.V. sings reverently. Dobie sings with
his eyes closed. Bluecoats do the best they can.

Dutch HUMS along. He notices an INDIAN standing among H.V.'s
bluecoats. This is TEN BEAR, Crow Tribe, dressed in a
scout's mixture of Indian and Bluecoat garb. He sings along
perfectly. Dutch gawks.

Ten Bear feels Dutch's eyes and meets his gaze.
EXT. PLAINS- AFTERNOON

Hundreds of hooves THUNDER over the plains. We still hear
the HYMN being sung. Riders are scattered over an acre.

Clay, Parcher, and Dobie ride grouped together. The Bluecoats
ride in rough formation. Dutch is driving the mess wagon.
H.V. rides at the head with Ten Bear.

GROUP (SINGING)
Thy body slain, sweet Jesus, thine,
And bathed in its own blood.

While the firm mark of wraith divine,
His soul, in anguish stood...

As the post-lapped HYMN ends-

CLAY
Damnation. We ain't going to find
kidnapped whites on a reservation.

PARCHER
I know it.

CLAY
I ain't set to waste my time while
they're scalping the men and raping
our women.

PARCHER
We're about a day's ride shy of the
Hunkpapa trail to Canada. S'where
I'd be headed if I was a band of
fugitive Indians.

Clay nods, thinking. Dobie listens attentively.

CLAY
We could set off alone.

PARCHER
I'm chewing the same cud, but
there'd only be four of us.
20.

CLAY
We have to find the Stewarts. If we
can do that with Henry Victor's
help, fine. If not, fine.

PARCHER
-.-I guess you’ve had every chance
to and ain't killed us yet. Though
what we'd do if-

Jump scare- Parcher suddenly LURCHES forward, his horse
SCREAMS and stumbles, nearly throwing him. Clay’s reigns in
his own horse and grabs the lead of Parcher’s, steadying the
animal as Parcher jumps clear.

DOBIE
Mr. Parcher! What...

Parcher gathers his wits.
PARCHER
S'alright, Dobie. Must of stepped
in a prairie dog hole.

Parcher puts a calming hand on his horse’s muzzle.

PARCHER (TO THE HORSE)
There you go. S’alright...

CLAY
How’s that leg?

Parcher crouches and examines the fetlock.

PARCHER
A little blood, but she’s standing
alright.
(to Dobie)

Hey, Cowboy, hump on ahead, see how
much further we're gonna press
before camp.

DOBIE
Yessir.

Parcher stands as Dobie spurs his horse forward. Once he's
out of earshot-

CLAY
Why do you spend so much time
rubbing that boy's belly? He
already thinks you're Jesus
Crocket.
21.

PARCHER
I'm courtin' his mother.

Parcher climbs up onto his horse.

CLAY

That's Gertrude Spacks' boy?
PARCHER

Yeah.
CLAY

Skinny woman.
Parcher looks at him. A beat.

CLAY (BONE DRY)
Might as well just poke the boy.

A beat. The first joke Clay’s made in months. Parcher laughs.
Clay lets himself smile, they spur their horses forward.

We TILT DOWN to what neither man saw, the “prairie dog hole”
that Parcher’s horse stepped in. Beneath the grass, the hole
is blood-colored, filled with dim GORE and shards of broken
RIB-BONES...

ACROSS THE GROUP

Dutch, driving the mess wagon, nods to Callaghan as he
passes. The young black man veers his horse closer.

DUTCH
Who is Henry Victor's Indian?

Callaghan looks towards the head of the group, where Ten Bear
gestures and talks low to H.V.

CALLAGHAN
Ten Bear. He's a Crow Indian. And
the man's paid for his work and
free to leave.

DUTCH
Yes?

CALLAGHAN
So he don't belong to Henry Victor.

BLACK BLUECOAT(O.S.)
Walnut!
22.

Callaghan looks over. A BLACK BLUECOAT, several years
Callaghan's junior,

BLACK BLUECOAT
Mr. Victor's canteen's dry.

Callaghan nods. The Black Bluecoat veers off.

DUTCH
He called you Walnut.
CALLAGHAN
Yeah he did.
DUTCH
Why?
CALLAGHAN

Thinks he's better'n me 'cause
nobody ever owned him. I'm not
enlisted. I cook for Fort Lincoln
but I'm paid and I can leave any
time. Understand?

DUTCH
Sure.
(uncomfortable beat.)
..-How are you called?

CALLAGHAN
My name's Callaghan.

DUTCH
Callaghan. I am Martin Van
Leijderova.

CALLAGHAN
Shit, man, I can't say that.

Dutch reaches out his hand. Callaghan shakes it, laughing.

DUTCH
I am also called Dutch.

CALLAGHAN
Good to meet you.

AT THE FRONT OF THE GROUP

Dobie rides past Bluecoats and forward to where H.V. takes a
pair of binoculars from Ten Bear.
23.

H.V. points out something straight ahead to two BLUECOAT
LIEUTENANTS. The Lieutenants nod and head back to their
squads. Ten Bear hands H.V. a rifle. H.V. sees Dobie-

HENRY VICTOR
Take a look yonder.

Dobie squints into the distance. A SHAPE in the grass.

DOBIE
Is that a horse?

He hands Dobie the binoculars. Dobie peers through-

DOBIE'S TELEPHOTO POV- A MINECONJOU INDIAN, dismounted from
his HORSE, walking in small, irregular circles and staring at
the ground.

The Mineconjou glances up, looking almost directly at Dobie,
then continues his search of the ground.

DOBIE
He's seen us.

HENRY VICTOR
You think I don’t know that?

DOBIE
Then why ain't he run?

ACROSS THE PLAINS- TWO COLUMNS of BLUECOATS, six men each,
break free of the group and CHARGE, galloping across the
plains towards the lone Indian.

DOBIE'S TELEPHOTO POV- The Indian sees the charging soldiers.
He runs for his horse, a spotted mustang.

The Mineconjou prepares to jump on his horse, as-—
H.V. raises the rifle to his shoulder, takes aim... CRACK.

DOBIE'S POV- the horse jerks with the rifle's impact and
twists sideways, falling to the ground.

ACROSS THE PLAINS- The Indian jumps away from the falling
beast as it kicks and pumps blood. The two columns of riders
race towards him, flanking him North and South, closing in
like pincers.

The Indian turns and sprints West, tearing on foot through
the tall grass. The two columns of mounted soldiers close
in, hooves THUNDER.
24.

The SOUTHERN COLUMN sweeps in first, scooping around the
Indian. He stops running and draws a knife.

He turns away from the Southern Column just in time for the
lead horse of the NORTHERN COLUMN to arrive, the mounted
Bluecoat swinging his rifle like a club-

CHUNK. The Indian catches the rifle flat across the side of
his head. His feet leave earth, he pinwheels through the
air, head trailing blood, and SLAMS into the ground.

EXT. PLAINS CAMP— LATE AFTERNOON

Clay crouches over the horse H.V. shot. Nearby, two
BLUECOATS bind the Indian's hands to a wagon wheel. Blood
leaks from the Indian's brow. Ten Bear crouches in front of
him, MURMURING at the captive.

Parcher looks at the Indian; Dobie and Dutch stand nearby,
staring. H.V. stands in the center, well-satisfied.

CLAY
You didn't have to shoot his horse.

HENRY VICTOR
Christ, you gonna make us bury
that, too?

Clay stands and H.V. crosses to Ten Bear.

HENRY VICTOR
What does he say?

TEN BEAR
Nothing.

HENRY VICTOR
Ask what he was looking for in the
grass.

Ten Bear leans in close and MURMURS words to the Indian,
making signs with his hands. No response.

Dutch pulls the photo of the Stewarts from his vest and hands
it to Clay. Clay nods and crouches next to Ten Bear, showing
the photo to the captive. To Parcher-

CLAY
Ask him.

Parcher speaks in sub-titled Sioux, making signs with his
hands as he speaks.
25.

PARCHER (SIOUX, S.T.)
<We need to find these white
people. Bad Indians took. You help,
we let you go.>

No response. Clay stands, annoyed.

CLAY
We don't have time for this. Let's
keep moving.

PARCHER
<You Blackfoot? Minneconjou?>
(no response)
<Minneconjou, I think. Look like
Bull Bear.>

The Indian looks up sharply.

PARCHER
<But you no Bull Bear. Bull Bear
dead. I bury him.>

Parcher nods, offers a friendly grin.

PARCHER
<You Dull Knife. Son of Bull Bear.>

The Indian, DULL KNIFE, stares at Parcher a few moments and
then drops his gaze. Parcher stands-

PARCHER
His name's Dull Knife.

CLAY
Carrying a prisoner's gonna slow us.

HENRY VICTOR
I'd rather walk in the right
direction than run with my head up
my ass. We're running short of
daylight, we'll camp here.

CLAY
We're wasting time we ain't got,
Henry. You know what's happening
to those Stewart girls right now?

Dutch looks sick. Clay presses the Stewart photo into H.V.'s
hands. H.V. is suddenly very conscious of the Bluecoats
nearby, watching.
26.

HENRY VICTOR
This isn't your outfit, Clay. If we
need to raise any pigs, we’ll ask
your advice. But renegade Indians
are my job.

CLAY
If men like me and Will Parcher
hadn't cleared this land of
Indians, men like you would be dead
on a spit and you know it.

HENRY VICTOR
These soldiers are under my
authority. Mine. So long as you
ride with us, you are, too.

He tries to hand the family photo back to Clay, who lets it
drop in the grass. Dutch appeals to Clay-

DUTCH
We’re not gonna stop...?

CLAY
That Indian doesn't know shit and
wouldn't talk if he did.

HENRY VICTOR (SMILING)
He'll talk.

Dutch picks the Stewart family photo out of the grass and
puts it back in his vest.

EXT. PLAINS CAMP- NIGHT

off-screen, Dull Knife SCREAMS. It's dinner time. None of
the Bluecoats look up from their plates or away from their
conversations, they've grown used to the sound.

Scattered CAMPFIRES. Men eat sociably, drink coffee.

WE MOVE TO-

Parcher, Clay, H.V., and Dobie sitting in a group near the
campfire, finishing dinner. 0.S., Dull Knife SCREAMS. Only
Dobie looks over.

WE MOVE TO-

Dutch moving through the Bluecoats, trying to see what's
happening to Dull Knife.
27.

Ten Bear is crouching in front of the bound Minneconjou, on
the edge of the firelight, doing something to the soles of
Dull Knife's feet. Dutch moves tangent to the two Indians,
circling around, trying to see what Ten Bear is doing. Dull
Knife SCREAMS. The cry echoes across the plains, no reaction
from the Bluecoats.

Ten Bear pulls a SMALL NOB away from Dull Knife's foot and
sets it on the ground, something pale with a dark, shiny
gloss. It could be metal, or it could be bone.

CALLAGHAN (0O.S. )
You don't want to see that.

Callaghan touches Dutch's shoulder and he jumps.

DUTCH
Walnut! ...Sorry. Callaghan, I
mean. ...Has he talked?
CALLAGHAN

Nah. Ain't even the point. Ten Bear
stopped asking questions a half
hour back. Come get some coffee.

They walk towards the mess wagon. Callaghan pats his leg.

CALLAGHAN
I was born with this leg gimp,
flesh all withered and shrunk. Mr.
Callaghan, the man that owned my
mother named me Walnut because he
thought I looked like one. I ain't
partial to the name.

They arrive at the wagon, Callaghan pours coffee. Dull
Knife's SCREAMS dies down to pained BREATHING.

DUTCH
I can't see anything wrong with
your leg.

CALLAGHAN

It's weak. Hurts most of the time.

DUTCH
--.-I don't like Henry Victor.

CALLAGHAN
The man's a sack of horse-shit.

Dutch grins in agreement. Then-
28.

DUTCH
I'm Belgian. But they thought I
was German on Ellis Island, so they
put my name down as "Dutch."

CALLAGHAN
What the hell kind of sense does
that make?

Dutch shakes his head.

CALLAGHAN
You come to this country alone?

DUTCH (SHAKING HIS HEAD)
I had a sister; the boat killed her
and we put her in the water. All I
kept of hers was a... I don’t know
the English... a “broche.”

Dutch gestures at his chest, shaping a brooch.

DUTCH
-..I gave it to Maryanne Stewart.

He looks at the ground. A beat.

DUTCH
I barely knew her but... I thought
she might...

Dutch swallows, takes a breath. Callaghan fills space-

CALLAGHAN
Tell me your real name again.

DUTCH
Van Martjin Leijderova.

CALLAGHAN
Shit. You want more coffee, Dutch?

DUTCH
Yeah.

Dutch glances over towards Dull Knife. He sits alone, bound
to the wagon wheel, feet covered in bloody rags.

CALLAGHAN
He’s give up for the night, praise
God.
(considers, then-)
Shit. I hope this gets me fired.
29.

Callaghan grabs the bowl of scraps and carries it over to
Dull Knife. He sets it on the ground next to him.

CALLAGHAN
Go on, you can eat. It's alright.

Dull Knife looks at the bowl of food, he wants it badly. He
looks at Callaghan. His eyes narrow, somewhere between
menace and pity.

DULL KNIFE (SIOUX, SUBTTLED)
<You’1ll be awake in your grave.
You’1l be alive when they feed.>

Callaghan furrows his brow, doesn’t understand. He nudges
the bowl of food again.

CALLAGHAN
Go on, eat.

No reaction from Dull Knife. Callaghan SIGHS and walks back
towards the Wagon, where Dutch drinks coffee.

HENRY VICTOR (0.S.)
Walnut! My tobacco's dry!

DUTCH
I got it.

Dutch grabs a sack of tobacco and walks towards the fire.

BY THE FIRE

Parcher, Dobie, Clay, H.V., and a half-dozen BLUECOATS sit.
They're drinking whiskey, coffee, they're rolling cigarettes.

Dutch approaches. H.V. sees him.

HENRY VICTOR
Where's Walnut?

DUTCH
I brought tobacco.

HENRY VICTOR
Much obliged.

H.V. takes the sack with one hand while he fishes in his vest
with the other, pulling out a small TOBACCO POUCH that he
tosses to Parcher. It looks like shriveled leather.

PARCHER
What the hell is this?
30.

HENRY VICTOR
Tobacco pouch.

PARCHER
It's ugly as shit.

HENRY VICTOR
Came off an Injun. Big buck named
Sackatabacky.

A few Bluecoats LAUGH.

CLAY
Oh, Jesus Christ.

Parcher throws the shriveled tobacco pouch back to H.V., who
fills it as he tells a story, excessively proud-

HENRY VICTOR
My daddy was one of the men behind
the rifles that held off the Sioux
at the battle for New Ulm.

H.V. meaningfully shakes the pouch.

HENRY VICTOR
Henry Victor senior cut this off
one of them Indians. Lends the
tobacco a sweetness I've grown
right partial to.

DOBIE
What is it?

PARCHER
It's a scrotum, Dobie.

Dobie reacts. H.V. turns his attention to the boy.

HENRY VICTOR
You know the story of New Ulm, boy?

DOBIE
Yessir. My father died there.

HENRY VICTOR
Well alright then. Did you know it
was more American civilians than
ever died in anything else? Not a
soldier among ‘em. Six hundred
dead by the lowest count.

(MORE)
31.

HENRY VICTOR (cont'd)
The Sioux knew they couldn't face
the army, so they attacked a town
of unarmed farmers, women,
children.

H.V. is condescending, tells the story like Sunday School.
He licks, seals, and lights a scrotal-tobacco cigarette.

DOBIE
Yessir, I heard that.

HENRY VICTOR
I hope you know your daddy died
noble. I'll raise a drink to him
and every man at this fire. We'll
make sure we never see anything
like that in this country again.

CLAY
I'll drink to it.

PARCHER
Any reason's a good one.

They raise flasks and enamel mugs, and drink.

They fall respectfully quiet. The sudden silence reveals a
SLURPING and CHEWING. They all look over, to-

Dull Knife, hungrily shoveling scraps from the bowl and into
his mouth. H.V. exhales smoke.

HENRY VICTOR
Who fed my Indian?

He stands, strides across the camp, and kicks the bowl out of
Dull Knife's hands. Scraps fly.

HENRY VICTOR
We don't find those settlers ‘til
he talks, so he don't eat ‘til he
talks. WHO FED MY GODDAMNED INDIAN?

H.V. kicks Dull Knife in the Stomach, doubling him over.
Chewed food flies from his mouth. H.V. picks up a loose
stirrup, a metal buckle on two feet of leather strap, an
impromptu LASH. Everybody watches him, Parcher and Clay get
to their feet.

HENRY VICTOR
Walnut? Where are you?

Walnut is absent. H.V. is rabid. Several tense moments, then-
32.

DUTCH
-..I fed him.

Everybody turns to look at Dutch. H.V. stalks towards Dutch
with the stirrup / lash. He raises his arm...

HENRY VICTOR
You ignorant son of a bitch...

CLAY
Henry.

H.V. looks over. Clay has a hand on his gun. H.V.
considers, then.

HENRY VICTOR
...-You raise that gun and all four
of you'll be on ropes in an hour.

Clay stands holding his gun. H.V. stands holding his lash.
Dutch looks like he's about to piss. Parcher gets up.

PARCHER
Christ, Henry, he was just gonna
shoot you a little bit. And if
Dutch fed him the same shit your
cook fed us, he ain't no happier'n
he was ‘fore he et. Leave it rest.

HENRY VICTOR
This is my command. Mine. I can't
have my authority undermined.

PARCHER(TO DUTCH)
Apologize to the man for
undermining him.

DUTCH
I am sorry.

With his accent, it's hard to suss his sincerity. H.V. spits
and shakes his head. To a Lieutenant-

HENRY VICTOR
Bugle taps, we're bedding down. I
want a three man watch until dawn.
I want guns on the night. Anybody
tries to sneak back into camp,
anything moves, kill it.
33.

TIME LAPSE- EXT. PLAINS CAMP-— NIGHT

The Bluecoats and cowboys wrapped in their blankets, asleep
in small groups. Soft SNORES, the RUSTLING grass.

A soft RATTLE rolls across the plains, like the largo
creaking of an ungreased door. Almost a PURR. Dutch lies
awake in his blankets, staring at the sky.

A BLUECOAT SENTRY slouched by the fire struggles to keep his
eyes open, leaning on his rifle. The RATTLING PURR laps
against him, each swell tugging him towards sleep. The soft
PURR rises again, the Sentry's eyes close.

A BLUECOAT LIEUTENANT sleeps on his side on the edge of camp,
spooning with his rifle.

Dutch looks over the camp. Everybody else is asleep.

Except Dull Knife. He sits awake, eyes sunken, desperate.
He stares at the plains, watching the slowly waving grass.

Dutch lies back down, watching Dull Knife. Dull Knife's eyes
shine in the campfire. Dutch closes his eyes.

The Bluecoat Lieutenant, sleeping soundly on his side. We
move to a short distance away, where a small circle of earth
beneath the grass slowly starts to TREMBLE. The circle
spreads, blades of grass fall.

Five man-shaped FIGURES crawl towards him out of the grass.
They slink on all fours, silent. In the starlight and dying
campfire embers, we can just barely see their burnt-looking,
mottled flesh. Their movement is predatory, inhuman.

The Bluecoat Lieutenant doesn't wake up when a TALON, an
organic-looking blade touches the hollow between his collar
bone and throat.

RIIIP- the talon is dragged across the Lieutenant's neck,
carving a deep trench in the flesh. The wound is deep but
does not bleed, the scarlet blood instantly coagulating.

The Lieutenant's eyes open and immediately hands on his body
CLAMP DOWN hard, holding him immobile.

The Lieutenant's eyes roll wildly. A RETCHING SOUND off
screen, a SPLATTER, and then the Lieutenant's face goes
slack. His eyes, still conscious, stare ahead.

He is completely immobile. A beat. A RATTLING. A PURR.
The Lieutenant is abruptly YANKED off-screen.
34.

FROM A DISTANCE-

Out in the plains, down in the grass, the dwindling campfires
offer a rich glow against the waving moonlit grass. SHAPES
are being dragged out into the plains, the grass forming V's
behind them, like a wake in water.

CUT TO BLACK

HENRY VICTOR (0.S.)
Bullshit! Bullshit! Bullshit!

EXT. PLAINS CAMP—- MORNING

Dutch opens his eyes. Most of the Bluecoats are already up.
Parcher is drinking coffee, getting his boots on. Dutch sits
up. H.V. storms around the camp like a child in a tantrum.

HENRY VICTOR
Somebody saw those yellow shit-
heels desert. I will not god-
damned believe four men left camp
and nobody even god-damned stirred.

Bluecoats hurry into boots and uniforms. Dutch sees Clay
standing nearby, looking out at the grass.

DUTCH(TO PARCHER)
What happened?

PARCHER
‘Morning, sweetheart. Henry Victor
lost some of his boys last night.

DUTCH
Where?
PARCHER
That's the question.
CLAY
Somebody dragged ‘em off.
DUTCH
The Indian didn't sleep. Dull

Knife.
TIME LAPSE- ACROSS CAMP— MORNING
Dull Knife stares at the ground, beaten and exhausted.

Parcher and Ten Bear crouch in front of him. Clay watches
from nearby, whisky bottle in hand. H.V. paces.
35.

PARCHER
Shit. You sure you didn't find him
out front of a tobacco shop?

H.V. snorts. Dutch approaches, tucking in his shirt.

YOUNG BLUECOAT(0O.S.)
Sir? Mr. Victor?

Henry Victor looks over, a YOUNG BLUECOAT is crouching over
one of the missing men's blankets.

YOUNG BLUECOAT
There's blood here, I think. Not a
lot, but...

H.V. stalks over, Clay on his heels. There is a six-inch
smear of blood on the soldier's gray blankets.

HENRY VICTOR
I've bled more from a pulled tooth.

He turns and stalks back over to Dull Knife. Clay crouches
and examines the blood. Parcher, crouching, speaks
conversationally with Dull Knife.

PARCHER(SIOUX, SUB-TITLED)
<Know you talk. Seen you talk,
young boy.>

No response from Dull Knife.

Henry Victor is livid, his face nearly twitching, staring at
Dull Knife. Dull Knife stares back.

H.V. steps on one of Dull Knife's bloody feet. Dull Knife
SCREAMS through clenched teeth. Dutch turns away, sick.
H.V. takes the weight off his foot. Dull Knife PANTS.

HENRY VICTOR
What's he got to say now?

PARCHER
We already know that don't work.

Parcher stands and turns away. Dull Knife catches his breath,
then the corner of his mouth twitches, he whispers-—

DULL KNIFE(SIOUX, SUB-TITLED)
<I'm glad they like white men,
too.>
36.

HENRY VICTOR
What was that?

TEN BEAR
He says he likes white men.

DULL KNIFE
<The Burrowers.>

Parcher listens intently.

TEN BEAR
He says about another tribe.
Miners.

HENRY VICTOR
Miners? Indian miners?

PARCHER
He didn't say "miners." Men mine.
He used the word for when animals
dig. Burrow, maybe.
(To Dull Knife)
<The tribe Burrowers? Last night?>

HENRY VICTOR
Let my buck do his job, Will.

Ten Bear leans in close to Dull Knife, cutting off Parcher.

TEN BEAR
<Where do we find the Burrowers?>

Dull Knife nearly manages a smile despite the pain.

DULL KNIFE
<...They'1l find you.>

He leans in, whispers just for Ten Bear-

DULL KNIFE
<Even if you do taste like white
man by now.>

They lock eyes. Ten Bear grabs Dull Knife's bloody mess of a
foot, SQUEEZES. Dull Knife SCREAMS.

Clay steps over and SHOVES Ten Bear off with his boot,
knocking him to the ground.

CLAY
I've finished listening to that
Indian scream.
37.

HENRY VICTOR
He's shit-all for information
anyway. We'll get our answers from
the reservation.

PARCHER
This ain't the Sioux, Henry. He
just said the Burrowers.

HENRY VICTOR
I don't have time to be second
guessed. There's four white women
out there've probably already...

H.V. swallows his last words, grimacing.

PARCHER
All the more reason we shouldn't be
looking in the one place we know
they ain't.

HENRY VICTOR
We have to fight the enemy that's
before us. We're going to the rez.

Parcher's about to respond, when,

DOBIE(0.S.)
Mr. Parcher!

They look over. Dobie is waving from the grass near the edge
of camp. Clay and Parcher head over. H.V. moves in the
opposite direction, towards his lieutenants.

AT THE EDGE OF CAMP-—

Parcher crouches over a CIRCULAR INDENTATION of crushed grass
next to Dobie, just like at Washburne Crick. Clay continues
past the circle, out towards the prairie.

PARCHER(TO DOBIE)
What do you think, Cowboy?

DOBIE
I dunno, sir.

CLAY (YELLING)
There's another one. A third
yonder.

He points further North. Behind them, H.V.'s Bluecoats are
already packing up and heading West. Parcher nods to Clay,
showing that he heard the man.
38.

PARCHER(TO DOBIE)
Shitfire. Henry Victor'd rather
pull fingers off the Sioux than
follow the trail before us.

DOBIE
Sorry, sir?

PARCHER
...I think we're about set to quit
our military escort.

EXT. SOUTHERN PLAINS— LATE MORNING

POUNDING HOOVES. Dutch, Clay, Parcher, and Dobie gallop out
through the grass, moving quickly now that they're alone.

Dutch looks back at the train of Bluecoats quickly vanishing
in the distance.

Clay, riding ahead, slows his horse to examine another
SHALLOW PIT in a ring of crushed grass.

TIME LAPSE- SOUTHERN PLAINS— AFTERNOON

Small, gnarled trees dot the landscape. The four riders cast
long shadows, climbing a gentle slope. From a distance, we
show how tiny they are, how isolated.

EXT. PLAINS CAMP- NIGHT

Dutch takes a swig from a bottle of whiskey. The four sit
around a campfire, the last scraps of dinner in the enamel
pot on the fire's edge. They're unrolling blankets, getting
ready for bed, passing the bottle.

Dutch shows Dobie how to roll a cigarette.

Clay takes an immensely satisfied drink and passes the
bottle. Parcher takes it and grins.

PARCHER
Great god a-mighty, I'm tired.
Ain't been rode this hard since we
gulched the Darrows.

Clay nods and hands him back the bottle. Parcher passes the
bottle to Dutch, then nudges Dobie.

PARCHER
On the trail of hostile Indians.
What do you think, cowboy?
39.

DOBIE (SMILING)
It's alright.

Dutch takes a swig and passes, then gets to his feet wearily,
stretching.

DUTCH
Excuse me.

Scratching his back, he walks away from the fire-

EXT. PLAINS- NIGHT

Only a stone's throw from camp, Dutch is already out of the
feeble, flickering throw of firelight. We can see how the

darkness and endless space makes him nervous.

The knee-deep grass is pitch-black in the moonlight. Dutch
pulls out his pecker and pisses into the grass.

BACK AT CAMP
Dobie takes a swig of liquor, pretending like he enjoys it.

PARCHER
You been doing real good, Dobie.

DOBIE
Thank you, sir.

PARCHER

You oughta sleep. We'll be up and

moving long before dawn. Only got

a few days to find them Stewarts

before we wouldn't want to.
Dobie starts to ask him what he means, then holds his tongue.
EXT. PLAINS- NIGHT
Dutch pisses into the grass, looking out at the few gnarled,
dwarfish trees shaking in the wind. His eyes are a little
glassy with liquor. He YAWNS.
From a distance- Dutch starts to button up his pants. We can
see him clearly silhouetted against the flickering light of
camp, an easy target.
A SHAPE passes in front of the camera.
EXT. PLAINS CAMP- NIGHT

Clay takes a pensive drink, sitting on his blankets.
40.

CLAY
You think those men last night
deserted?

PARCHER
You mean ruther'n got drug off?

Clay nods. Beat. Parcher shakes his head.
PARCHER
F’they did, I hope they died fast.
You ever heard of an Indian tribe
called the Burrowers?
Clay shakes his head no, and pulls a BIBLE from his vest.

CLAY
We'll stand watch, two hour shifts.

EXT. PLAINS- NIGHT

Dutch turns and starts walking back towards camp. He doesn't
hear a SNAP a dozen yards away.

He continues towards camp, leaving frame. We linger on the
dark landscape behind him-

Against the waving grass, between the small, gnarled trees,
it's impossible to see clearly. But we can just make out-

TWO SHAPES, moving towards the fire.

EXT. PLAINS CAMP- NIGHT

Dobie curls into his blankets and closes his eyes. Parcher
already looks asleep. Only Clay sits upright, holding
Parcher's rifle, reading his bible by fire-light.

Dutch walks into the edge of the firelight. He doesn't see
the DARK SHAPE looming behind him.

Clay looks up at Dutch, then past him. A momentary look of
concern crosses his face. He puts his Bible in his vest.

The grass sways in the wind behind Dutch. Clay jerks the
rifle up and levels it, almost directly at Dutch.

Dutch freezes.

DUTCH
What...
4l.

CALLAGHAN (OFF-SCREEN)
Don't shoot!

Dutch jumps like something bit him.

Parcher comes out of his blankets, cocking his revolver as he
sits up. Dobie scrambles to his feet.

CALLAGHAN
It's me, it's Callaghan, Mr. Henry-
Victor's cook.

Leading his horse, Callaghan emerges from the darkness behind
Dutch, and into the firelight.

PARCHER
Shitfire, Walnut. You alone?

CALLAGHAN
Yeah.

Parcher drops his pistol.

CLAY
You trying to get shot?

Callaghan moves in towards the fire, realizing how close to
getting shot he was.

PARCHER
Great Christ. Tie up your horse
and set. You missed dinner.

Callaghan nods thanks to Parcher, then nods hello to Dutch.
Dutch nods back.

TIME LAPSE- EXT. PLAINS CAMP-— NIGHT

Callaghan sits with the others, their conversation already in
progress.

CALLAGHAN
I can't rightly account for the
others. Didn't even know they was
missing until now.

CLAY
Deserting the army's a felony.
They could hang you for that and
jail us for riding with you.

CALLAGHAN
I didn't desert. Weren't enlisted.
42.

Clay looks at Parcher, who raises his eyebrows in question.
Clay nods.

PARCHER
Well, if you're riding with us,
you're working for us.

CALLAGHAN
That's fine.

CLAY
It's nasty work in unfriendly
country. You want to make it back
to the ranch, you'll follow and do
as your told.

Callaghan nods. Pauses, then-

CALLAGHAN
Can I ask, which one of y'all is
boss?

CLAY
We're partners.

DUTCH
Listen to Parcher, do what Clay
says.

PARCHER
I'll be dog, the German's been
paying attention... Welcome to the

outfit, Walnut.
Parcher reaches out and shakes Callaghan's hand.
EXT. SOUTHERN PLAINS- PRE-DAWN

In the lead-gray light, the five riders course across the
grasslands.

EXT. SOUTHERN PLAINS- DAY

One of the round SHALLOW PITS of crushed grass and churned
earth. The five riders pass in the distance.

EXT. SOUTHERN PLAINS CAMP— NIGHT

Coffee's on the campfire, Callaghan dishes out food. The
grass moves in the wind around them.
43.

EXT. PLAINS, HUNKPAPA TRAIL- LATE AFTERNOON

Dutch, Dobie, and Callaghan ride in a loose group through the
grass. Dobie pulls the mess wagon.

Parcher and Clay have ridden ahead and sit talking. The
three ride close enough to hear their conversation-

PARCHER
-..seen the last of them pits a
half day back.

The trail before them is little more than a slight depression
in the earth, stretching roughly East and West.

PARCHER
I'd say we follow the trail, but
it's your call.

CLAY
.-.-Take your rest. I need to
ruminate.

Parcher SIGHS. They all dismount, except Clay, who rides a
few paces forward.

Dutch walks over to Parcher, who takes a swig of whiskey.

DUTCH
Which way are we going?

PARCHER
You’1l go whatever direction we
tell you to, I guess.

Parcher offers Dutch the whiskey. Dutch drinks, then gives
the bottle back.

He walks back towards Dobie and Callaghan, grabs a small
stone from the ground, and chucks it at a gnarled, dead tree
eighty feet distant. The stone makes a pleasant TOK sound
against the trunk.

Dobie grins at Dutch, impressed. The boy grabs a rock off
the ground, aims, and throws it at the tree. It sails past,
well wide. Dobie leans down, searches among the grass roots,
and picks up another stone. He chucks it at the tree, and
again misses.

Callaghan sees the game and joins in, picking up stones and
throwing them at the tree. He misses twice.
44,

Dutch watches the two try to repeat his throw, smiling as
they keep missing. It’s a moment of near-relaxation, the
three suddenly boys again.

Dobie steps forward into the grass, and stoops down,
searching the dark earth for another stone...

Dutch pulls a piece of grass from its sheath and chews on the
tender base.

FROM A DISTANCE- we see the five men alone in an ocean of
grass, vulnerable.

Dobie can’t find another stone. He pushes some grass aside
and pauses. There’s an 8-inch lock of BLONDE HAIR pressed
into the dark earth.

Dobie’s hand hovers over the strands for a moment before
lifting it from the ground. It’s human hair. He gives it a
gentle tug.

SCHRT, the lock of hair RIPS free from the earth, a blood-red
postage stamp of wet SCALP dangling from the end.

Dobie’s jaw drops. He GASPS and flings the hair away.

Callaghan steps over, looks down. There’s a patch of OPEN
WOUND in WHITE FLESH in the ground.

He kneels and pushes some looses soil from around the wound
in the earth, revealing SKIN.

Dutch walks slowly towards them. He sees the flung bloody
lock of hair suspended in the tall grass. He spits out the
piece of grass he was chewing on, looks at the ground where
Callaghan is pushing away the soil...

Callaghan'’s digging reveals a WOMAN’S EYE, crusted with soil,
staring up at the sky.

Dobie SCREAMS.

The buried woman’s pupil CONTRACTS.

TIME LAPSE- EXT. PLAINS, HUNKPAPA TRAIL- DUSK

The woman, waifishly thin, blonde, lies on the grass. She's
in a coma and a filthy gingham dress. Grass stains, dirt,
and dried blood mark her pale skin. There is a SOFT
SCRATCHING noise off-screen, like a cat pawing at a door. It
sounds like its coming from inside of her.
45.

PARCHER
She's breathing.

Parcher is crouched next to her. He tries to press her
eyelids down, but they won't stay shut. Her eyes keep
creeping open, staring without motion at the dark blue sky.

The other four men stand over her, looking down.

DUTCH
She's not one of the Stewarts.

CLAY
Then who is she?

Dutch shakes his head. We'll call the woman AUDREY.

Parcher pushes Audrey's head gently to the side, better
exposing a deep, six-inch wound tore roughly into her neck
and shoulder. There's no blood but that inside the wound
itself, thickened like raspberry jam.

CLAY (RE: THE WOUND)
Same as Williams' wife.

PARCHER
Yeah. And she should have bled out
more, too.

Parcher leans in. Small WHITE GROWTHS line the wound,
clustered like frog eggs. The thickened blood glistens.

PARCHER
It's still moist. Maybe infected.

Parcher reaches out and touches gently around the angry pink
edges of the wound. He pushes back the edge of Audrey's
collar, revealing a small GOLD CRUCIFIX on a chain.

Dutch leans in to get a better look. The fungal-looking
white growths surround the cross in the wound.

CLAY
She got any other marks on her?

PARCHER
You got eyes.

Clay doesn't respond. The SCRATCHING sound is still there,
from somewhere inside Audrey.

DUTCH
Something's scratching.
46.

Callaghan and Dobie look at him, but nobody responds.
Parcher lifts one of the woman's arms, there are BRUISES
running up and down it. More bruises on her neck.

He lifts up a piece of her dress, looks at the long vertical
tears and green stains on the fabric.

PARCHER

She's been drug a spell.
CLAY

What else?
PARCHER

What else you want, John?

CLAY
Did the Indians rape her?

Dobie's eyes bug out, he gulps back shock. Dutch is
listening hard, the SCRATCHING sound is still audible.

PARCHER
How the hell am I supposed to know?

DUTCH
Something’s scratching inside her.

CLAY
What are you talking about?

CALLAGHAN
I hear it, too.

Dutch crouches down, across from Parcher, over Audrey's face.
Audrey's eyes stare unmoving upward. As Dutch gets closer to
Audrey, the SCRATCHING gets louder.

He moves down towards the fringes of her torn dress. The
SCRATCHING gets louder.

One of her shoes is gone. The SCRATCHING is coming from
inside her other shoe.

DUTCH
It's in her shoe.

CLAY
Pull it off.

Dutch looks at Clay, then reaches for the shoe and pauses.
The SCRATCHING is fervent, insect-like.
47.

Dutch pulls off the shoe.
Her foot is bare beneath. Audrey's fourth toe is wiggling.
Nobody's sure how to react.

Audrey's toe wiggles, her chest barely moves with her
breathing, she stares unmoving at the sky.

TIME LAPSE- EXT. PLAINS CAMP-— NIGHT

From beside the campfire, Dutch can just barely see Parcher
and Clay standing out on the prairie, past the edge of the
flickering firelight. They're deep in conversation, sharing
a bottle of whisky.

Dutch is crouched over Audrey, cleaning the dirt off of her
face with canteen water. Callaghan sits on the ground
nearby, blowing on his coffee to cool it.

Dobie stands on the other side of the fire, anxious, kicking
at the embers. He keeps looking at Audrey, building up to
something.

Dutch pushes Audrey's head to the side and tries to wipe at
the scab sticking the gold cross to her wound. Her head
keeps slipping out of his grasp. To Callaghan-

DUTCH
Can you hold her head?

CALLAGHAN
Naw, man. I'm not touching her.

DUTCH
She can't mind.

CALLAGHAN
It ain't her I'm worried about.

Dobie approaches from around the fire, anxious. He points at
Audrey-

DOBIE
Is that what rape is?
DUTCH
What?
DOBIE

Is that what rape is?
48.

DUTCH
No...

CALLAGHAN
We don't know what them Indians did
to her.

Dobie stares at Audrey, thinking hard, then turns sharply
away and walks out towards Parcher and Clay. Callaghan blows
on his coffee.

EXT. PRAIRIES OUTSIDE CAMP- CONTINUOUS

Parcher and Clay speak softly, low enough to escape the
others' ears. Dobie approaches in the background, hearing
the conversation already in progress-—

CLAY
--.-don't know anything about him.
That's the point.

PARCHER
And what do we know about Dutch?

CLAY
He's white.

PARCHER
But he ain't American.

CLAY
I'm not about to leave a helpless
white woman alone with a negro we
don't know. They got... urges.
It's scientific.

Dobie hovers on the edges of their conversation, hoping to be
noticed, too nervous to butt in.

PARCHER

Shit-fire, everybody's got urges.
That's why God invented free will,
morals. And maybe you ain't met
enough Occidentals to know it, but
they got a lot more free will than
they got morals. What do you want,
Dobie?

Dobie's off guard. Parcher waits. Clay looks annoyed.

DOBIE
Um... Is that... What's rape?
49.

Parcher looks at him and grins. He looks at Clay.

PARCHER
That'll do.

CLAY
He's just a boy.

PARCHER
Exactly.
(louder, to Dobie)
Cowboy, we got a job for you.

EXT. PRAIRIE CAMP- NIGHT

The campfire is dying down. Lying awake in his blankets,
Dutch stares at the small flames dancing over the embers.

Callaghan, Clay, and Dobie are asleep in their blankets,
scattered around the fire. Parcher sits by Audrey with his
rifle across his knees, looking out over the plains.

Dutch admits he won't sleep, climbs out of his blankets, and
crosses to Parcher.

PARCHER
Dutch. You're watch ain't another
hour yet.

DUTCH

I couldn't sleep.

PARCHER (NODDING)
Dark business. Finding that woman
means we're on the right trail.

DUTCH
Why would they bury her alive?

PARCHER
+..-I dunno. It's a miracle she
ain't dead.

DUTCH
What if they buried Maryanne?

Parcher spits into the fire. Dutch remains determined-

DUTCH
We'll find her.
50.

They sit in silence for a few moments. The fire light
reflects in Audrey's eyes. Dutch looks at the glint of gold
stuck in the wound on her neck.

DUTCH
..-What about her cross?
(Parcher looks over,)
It's stuck in her... in the blood.

Parcher peers at the cross and nods.

PARCHER
...-Maybe that ain't good. You got
religion, Dutch?

Parcher takes the cross between his thumb and forefinger,
avoiding touching the thick red blood glistening beneath.

DUTCH
I never did.

Parcher pulls on the cross. It's stuck in the gore, pulls at
the wound, Audrey's torn flesh puckering.

PARCHER
You should get some. Might balance
the account of your upbringing.

Parcher tugs and the cross RIPS free of the wound. Parcher's
hand jerks away unexpectedly and the gold chain around
Audrey's neck SNAPS.

PARCHER
Oh. Shoot.

There's a dark spot in the wound where the cross was,
surrounded by the faint outline of a cross in the tiny white
growths.

PARCHER
Here, it's yours.

Parcher presses the cross into Dutch's hand.

DUTCH
What do I do with it?

PARCHER
Hellfire, I don't know. Find
comfort in your maker. Take this,
too. It's your watch.
51.

He shoves his rifle into Dutch's hand and crosses to his
blankets. Dutch holds the cross and the rifle. He wipes the
blood off the crucifix, rubbing it clean on his jeans. He
holds the cross up to the light.

In the glint of the fire, he can just see the small white
FUNGAL GROWTHS clinging to its surface.

EXT. PLAINS CAMP—- MORNING

Dutch pulls tight the ropes holding Audrey to the wagon.
She's lying face-up, eyes still open, on piled blankets.

Dobie's horse is tied to the wagon. The other four horses
are packed with provisions and camping gear. They're all
getting ready to leave. Parcher, to Dobie-

PARCHER
Once you get to Fort Lincoln, stay
with her, we'll pick you up on our

way back.

DOBIE
I could catch up with you in a day
or two.

CLAY

We don't have more'n a day or two
‘fore those missing are corpses.
Or worse.

Parcher leans in conspiratorially to Dobie.
PARCHER
Wouldn't trust any other man in the
outfit to do the job.
Dobie grins, proud.
PARCHER
Don't ride at night lest you want
to break old Sparrow's leg.

Parcher pats the flank of Dobie's horse.

DOBIE
I know it, sir.

Dutch looks at the rising sun, still low over the horizon,
then at Audrey's unblinking eyes. He tries to push her lids
down one more time and again they slowly slide open.
52.

CLAY
Enough. Let's go.

Dutch looks over, everybody's mounting up.

Dutch takes off his derby and puts it low over Audrey's head,
so that it shields her eyes.

EXT. PLAINS- DAY, MONTAGE

We're sinking slowly towards the ground. Various shots,
always lower: Dobie riding South alone with the comatose
woman wearing Dutch's hat. The other four RIDE HARD North.

The sun climbs and we sink. Bleached buffalo bones mark the
passing hours like sundials.

The four riders pass the charred scrap remainders of a teepee
village at a gallop.

Lower and lower, the four ride into the NORTHERN PLAINS, more
varied country, we can see mountains in the distance. The
land rises and falls, is dotted with small groups of trees,
scrub and silver-barked birch.

SOUTHERN PLAINS- Still sinking. Dobie sees FOUR FIGURES on
foot ahead, walking the trail towards him.

NORTHERN PLAINS- Still sinking. Dutch and the others ride
into scattered birch trees, almost glowing in the gloaming.

We sink into the earth, past PALE SHAPES that could be bones,
and might be moving.

BLACK ON SCREEN

EXT. BIRCH FOREST- AFTERNOON

Clay and Parcher ride at the front, Dutch and Callaghan at
the rear. The forest is unnaturally quiet, we can hear the

trees moving in the wind. To Dutch-

CALLAGHAN
I don't like this quiet.

CLAY
Hold your peace.

There's an urgency in his voice. Parcher looks at him.

CLAY
Yonder.
53.

Clay nods ahead and halts his horse. A FIGURE is approaching
through the tangle of birch. Parcher puts his hand on his
gun and draws his horse to a stop alongside. He squints into
the forest.

PARCHER
I can't see him.

CLAY
Looks Sioux.

Dutch and Callaghan draw to a stop along side. Dutch sees
Parcher's hand on his gun.

DUTCH
What...?

CLAY
Hush.

Dutch puts a hand on his gun. Callaghan follows suit. A
BIRD WHISTLE comes from behind them, possibly a human
imitation of the sound.

PARCHER
Shit. They got us flanked. I'm
counting on you boys with young
eyes to see that man draw his gun.
Don't be bashful about shooting
back if he does.

The Figure gets closer, coming through the trees, the stick
in his hand might be a RIFLE.

Another WHISTLE. Dutch looks back, towards the sound,
nothing but the visual noise of birch trees.

Dutch turns back facing forward and sees a SIOUX WARRIOR
emerge from the forest ahead, barely twenty feet away. The
Sioux Warrior raises his rifle...

Dutch draws his pistol and FIRES. The Sioux turns and
sprints back into the forest. Before Dutch can fire a second
shot, Clay swings a huge arm and knocks him from his horse.
Dutch drops his gun and CRASHES to the ground painfully.

The four horses, gunshot spooked, prance and turn.
Callaghan's horse glances a hoof across Dutch's brow with a

CRACK like wood breaking. Dutch CRIES OUT and puts hands to
his bleeding head.
54.

CLAY
Goddamnit! That was a greeting!

Clay trots his horse a few steps forward into the birch.
Parcher looks forward to him.

PARCHER
We got trouble?

CLAY
I expect.

Dutch sits up, looks at the blood on his hands. There's a
two-inch gash on his forehead.

DUTCH
I'm shot.

PARCHER
Oh Jesus Christ amighty. Walnut's
horse kicked you. And you deserve
worse.

Clay rides back to the group.

PARCHER
So what do we do?

CLAY
We keep at it.

He turns to Dutch.

CLAY
You so much as touch your gun
without my say so and I'll holster
it in your ass. Understand?

On the ground, holding his bleeding head, Dutch nods.
EXT. SOUTHERN PLAINS- AFTERNOON

Dobie cautiously approaches a FAMILY OF SIOUX on foot. An
OLD MAN, OLD WOMAN, TEENAGE GIRL, and a BOY.

Dobie and the family, both sides nervous, exchange pantomimed
greetings and trade. Dobie reaches a slab of beef jerky from
the wagon and offers it. The Old Man takes it, nodding and
smiling. He gestures and speaks softly to the Girl, who
pulls a twist of tobacco from her pouch.

The Old Woman, at the wagon's side, inspects Audrey. She
sees the wound on Audrey's neck.
55.

Suddenly the Old Woman is TALKING fast and low in SIOUX. The
Old Man steps forward and takes a look.

DOBIE
Hey, now... Don't...

Dobie puts a hand on his gun. The Old Woman's still TALKING,
pointing at the gash with it's small white growths.

The Old Man turns, doesn't even look at Dobie, grabs the Boy
and Teenage Girl, and all four walk swiftly away.

Dobie, confused, watches them go. The Sioux walk swiftly up
the trail, they don't even look back.

EXT. BIRCH FOREST- DUSK

The world tilts uneasily around Dutch. He gingerly touches
the WOUND on his head, the skin angry and pink around it.

The four are riding in a rough group through the trees,
cautious, all eyes scanning for Indians. The birch have
become even more dense, visibility is minimal.

Parcher is riding point, Clay is bringing up the rear.
Callaghan pulls his horse over next to Dutch's.

CALLAGHAN
You all right?

DUTCH
I’1l live.

CALLAGHAN

Mr. Parcher told you to shoot.

It’s moral support and Dutch takes it, nodding.

DUTCH
What does it mean, “to holster in
the ass?"

CALLAGHAN

Means he’s sweet on you.

Clay suddenly appears beside them, spurring his horse forward
towards Parcher. Callaghan and Dutch fall silent.

CLAY (TO PARCHER)
I don't like this. You think that
Indian was Burrower tribe?
56.

PARCHER
Looked Sioux. But there’s more
flavors of Sioux than I can count.

CLAY
Why ain’t we heard of them before?

PARCHER
Can’t say. I expect they'll
introduce themselves shortly. The
Kraut ain't made us the most
popular white men in Dakota.

CLAY (NODDING)
I'm libel to drop him when we get

back.
PARCHER
Amen to that.
DUTCH
I stay on until we find the

Stewarts.

Dutch has pulled up beside Clay and Parcher. He’s determined,
blood flaking from his brow. Clay nods, assenting.

PARCHER
That might not be so far off.
F’that Indian you shot at wanted to
talk, he wanted to trade. And the
only thing he’d have we might want
is white folks.

DUTCH
You mean the Stewarts?

CLAY
It's possible. But we don’t trade
for whites.

DUTCH
But it means we’re close.

Clay nods.

CLAY
...We're pushing four days now they
been gone.

PARCHER
Does it change anything if this is
revenge rather'n rescue?
57.

DUTCH
This isn’t.... We can still find
her. Even if she’s been.... hurt.

Parcher looks at Clay, waits for an answer.

CLAY
He’s right. We ain’t found bodies.
We don’t sleep tonight, we don’t
stop--

Clay's neck EXPLODES. The CRACK of a rifle. Blood splatters
backwards, spraying Dutch and Callaghan. Jugular spray pumps
obscenely skyward as Clay falls backwards off his horse.

Parcher's horse bucks as he draws his revolver. Dutch wipes
blood from his eyes.

Callaghan draws in a breath to scream, another CRACK, and his
horse jerks violently backwards, eyes wild. Blood pours from
behind its ear and the animal falls, pinning Callaghan’s
ankle beneath the saddle.

Clay SLAMS onto his back on the ground, blood pumping from
his neck. He kicks at the earth, eyes rolling in his head.
Parcher grabs his rifle and jumps off his horse.

More GUNSHOTS echo from the surrounding forest, WAR CRIES
from every direction.

Dutch scrambles off his horse. Callaghan's horse, lying on
the ground, pinwheels its legs and froths at the mouth.
Callaghan pulls frantically, trying to free his leg.

Splinters fly off the birch trees above at the impact of
bullets. BLAM, BLAM, and WAR CRIES. Dutch fires his pistol
back wildly.

Parcher crawls over. Clay is fish-belly white where he isn't
bloody. His eyes have stopped moving.

Dutch crawls to Callaghan, still pinned beneath the saddle.

DUTCH
Stop pulling.

Callaghan relaxes his leg. Dutch lifts the saddle and
Callaghan pulls free.

Parcher crawls over to Callaghan's horse and SHOOTS it in the
head. The horse twitches and stops moving.
58.

PARCHER
Get over here!

Parcher scrambles behind the horse, between it and some
deadfall, finding an impromptu bunker. Callaghan crawls over
to join him, Dutch close behind.

BLAM, BLAM, the gunshots continue. The WAR CRIES echo from
every direction.

Dutch, Parcher, and Callaghan lie on the ground between the
horse and the deadfall. Dutch fumbles more bullets into the
chamber of his gun. THUNK, a bullet slams into the corpse of
Callaghan's horse.

Callaghan raises up with his pistol and Parcher puts a hand
on his arm, stopping him.

PARCHER
Don't waste your bullets. We'll
shoot when they're close enough to
kill.

WAR CRIES. THUNK, the horse twitches at the impact of
another bullet. BLAM... BLAM... the rifle shots slow.

We can hear FOOTSTEPS, the CRUNCH of dry leaves.

Dutch peeks out from behind the horse. Clay is staring back
at him, impossible to tell if the man is dead or not.

A SIOUX WARRIOR emerges from the trees behind Clay, carrying
a pistol and a maul. Dutch's eyes widen. The warrior pauses
over Clay's corpse, raises the maul, and SKRUNCH, sinks it
into Clay's face, nearly taking off the dead man's jaw.

BLAM, Dutch cringes at the sound of the rifle directly over
his head. The Sioux Warrior spins and falls to the ground
with a shoulder wound.

Parcher shucks another round into his rifle as he drops back
to the ground behind the horse. BLAM, BLAM, BLAM, rifle shots
and WAR CRIES answer Parcher's fire.

Dutch presses himself to the ground, Callaghan likewise.
Parcher waits, gets an eye over the horse.

Another SIOUX is pulling the first to his feet. Parcher
springs up and BLAM, shoots the second Sioux dead in the
chest. Parcher drops back behind the horse.

BLAM, a single shot answers. Scattered WAR CRIES die off.
59.

Parcher, Dutch, and Clay lay behind the dead horse. They
realize that they are laying in a pool of horse blood,
spreading crimson against the fallen, silver leaves of birch.

They can hear the PANTING and MOANS of pain as the shoulder-
wounded Sioux gets to his feet and runs into the forest.

RUNNING, the CRUNCH of dead leaves scatter in every
direction. Parcher, Dutch, and Clay lie behind the horse and
try to catch their breath.

FROM ABOVE- we see that they line up like a zodiac. Three
men lying in blood behind the dead horse, Clay dead on his
back in his own blood, the chest-shot Sioux dead a stone's
throw away. Sudden silence with the cessation of gunfire.

EXT. SOUTHERN PLAINS- DUSK
The plains are unnaturally quiet.

Dobie softly whistles ALAS AND DID MY SAVIOR BLEED. He's
assembled a small camp fire and laid out his blankets a short
distance from the mess wagon, where Audrey lies, still
wearing Dutch's derby.

DOBIE
I guess we can make you a might
more comfortable. Don't uh...
Don't think I'm being forward or
nothing.

Dobie approaches Audrey, a little nervous. He shyly grins
and lifts her from the wagon. Her eyes look up at the sky.

Dutch's hat falls from Audrey's head and onto the ground.
Dobie lays Audrey on a thick pad of blankets.

DOBIE
There. Now, lemme...

Dobie pushes a rolled blanket beneath her head like a pillow.
In the strange silence of the plains, we can hear the
SCRATCHING of Audrey's toe in her shoe.

DOBIE
Well, now. Right civilized.

Dobie looks down at Audrey. His head bobs down towards her,

and he pauses. He grins nervously, looks around at the empty
plains. Then ducks down and pecks Audrey a quick KISS on her
lower, parched lip. While kissing her, the SCRATCHING STOPS.
60.

DOBIE
Good night.

Dobie looks down at her, a goofy smile on his face. The
SCRATCHING in her shoe starts again. Dobie furrows his brow,
puzzled. He looks at the shoe.

He reaches out timidly and covers Audrey's eyes. The
SCRATCHING stops. He takes his hand away, the SCRATCHING
starts again.

Dobie takes a breath, repeats the experiment. Covers her
eyes and the SCRATCHING stops, uncovers and it starts again.

DOBIE
Jesus. You're awake.

Dobie looks like he could cry.

DOBIE
You're... I'm so sorry. What
did... What did they do to you?

Dobie looks down her. She stares sightlessly at the sky, her
toe SCRATCHING in her shoe.

Dobie moves off to his own blankets.

Beneath the SCRATCHING, out in the plains, we can hear that
same RATTLING CREAK, a soothing GURGLE.

TO BLACK

PARCHER (WHISPERING, V.O.)
Christ amighty, is he asleep?

EXT. BIRCH FOREST- NIGHT

Dutch opens his eyes, putting a hand to the angry wound
splitting his scalp and GROANING.

DUTCH
I’m awake.

PARCHER
God damn if you ain't the dumbest
white man I ever met.

They're all still crouched between the dead horse and the
pile of fallen birch. A stiff BREEZE moves through the
forest, RATTLING the leaves.
61.

Dutch blearily wipes at his face. Dried blood flakes off
like scales.

CALLAGHAN
I ain't heard a thing in hours.

DUTCH
How long are we gonna wait here?

PARCHER
They could be waiting in ambush.

They sit in the broken moonlight.

CALLAGHAN
.--Billy's starting to smell.

Parcher and Dutch look at him for clarification.

CALLAGHAN
S'what I named the horse.

PARCHER
That's my name.

Small grins from Dutch and Callaghan.

CALLAGHAN
I didn't know that, Mr. Parcher.
Real sorry.

PARCHER
Shit fire. The horse is dead,
Walnut, call it what you like.

Parcher shakes his head. Then reaches out with a gloved
hand, and pulls a bunch of leafy vines from the base of a
tree. He squints at it in the darkness. Parcher makes a
CLICKING noise in his throat, thinking.

PARCHER

That's poison oak, ain't it?
CALLAGHAN

Looks it.
PARCHER

---I tell you what. Put your
gloves on, pile up as much of this
stuff as you can. We ain't waiting
for dawn.
62.

EXT. SOUTHERN PLAINS- NIGHT
CLOSE UP of Dobie's peaceful, sleeping face.
A TEARING sound, ripping flesh.

RATTLES and HISSES, something like snakes or insects. Dobie
blearily opens his eyes.

A shadow withdraws from over him, shifting in the firelight.
A SIX INCH CUT freshly gouged in Dobie's neck.

The FIGURE crouching over Dobie is back-lit by the fire,
barely discernible. It grabs Dobie by the arm and rolls him
up onto his side.

Dobie struggles for a moment, thrashing an arm, before a
RETCHING sound precedes a HOT SPLASH of liquid hitting his
neck. Dobie's thrashing arm goes limp. His eyes freeze
forward, staring across the camp fire.

Beyond the camp fire, concealed by their flames, THREE MORE
FIGURES, like small men, crouch over Audrey. The shifting
firelight barely reveals them. They're on Audrey as if
working on her. They arch their backs and tug, making
SLURPING noises, like geriatrics sucking tapioca.

The Figure over Dobie drops him and he rolls helplessly onto
his back, eyes staring upwards. The Figure is out of his
sight too quickly for Dobie to clearly see it. Thick liquid
drips onto Dobie's face and neck.

Where the bile drops, it STEAMS quickly away, leaving tiny
WHITE GROWTHS.

The RATTLING and GURLGING sounds continue. Dobie is left
momentarily alone, staring upwards. There is fear in his
unmoving eyes.

The LITTLE FINGER of his left hand WIGGLES. Dobie's unmoving
eyes stare upward. The finger WIGGLES.

THREE FIGURES return to him, crouching over him, blocking out
the light of the fire. They cluster on the periphery of
Dobie's vision. THREE MORE join the crowd, completely
casting Dobie into shadow. A SEVENTH.

Dobie is unable to turn his eyes and look at the hands that
grab onto his arms and legs. He's lifted from the ground and
suddenly moving away from camp.

Tall grass flies past as he's dragged helplessly through the
planes. Dobie stares up at the grass, the starry sky beyond.
63.

He is dragged by the seven Figures far out into the plains,
well out of the firelight's range. And suddenly dropped.

We hear GRASS TORN from the ground. The sounds of EARTH
MOVING. Dobie, staring upwards, cannot see what is
happening. The Figures PUFF and HISS as they dig, pushing
earth aside.

The monstrous hands roll Dobie over once, twice, and into a
SHALLOW PIT. Dobie lands face-up in a hole in dark earth the
size of a coffin.

From the edges of his vision, he sees the dim outline of the
Figures pushing freshly dug earth towards him. They cover
him from the feet-up in about four inches of soil. They
cover his belly, his chest.

A thin layer of dirt is pushed over his face, until only one
eye barely peeks out of the rich soil, one nostril is left
free to breath.

We hear the Figures turn and move off. The sounds again of
GRASS TEARING and EARTH MOVING and then sudden SILENCE.

In the dark soil beneath an ocean of grass, Dobie's eye
stares helplessly out across the plains. Tiny particles of
soil around his nostril shake with his weak breathing.

Several feet away from his eye, a tiny patch of earth is
shaking a little bit, as if a mole were trying to surface.

We SINK down into that earth, and several inches below it,
find Dobie's little finger WIGGLING.

FADE TO BLACK
EXT. BIRCH FOREST— PRE-DAWN

The forest is misty, the first hints of sub-horizon lead-
colored light off in the distance. Dutch and Callaghan are
sweating, steam rising from their bodies as they work. The
pile of poison oak is twenty feet long and four feet high.

Nearby, Parcher ties John Clay's corpse to a TRAVEAU. It's
like a tight hammock woven between two birch saplings tied to
the horse's saddle, one end left to drag on the ground.

Callaghan throws another bunch of leaves onto the pile and
pauses, breathing.

CALLAGHAN (WHISPERING)
They used to make us burn this shit
in Georgia.
64.

DUTCH (WHISPERING)
Yeah?

CALLAGHAN
Knew a man got caught downwind and
inhaled the smoke. Bled from his
lungs for two days and then died.
Drowned in his own blood.

PARCHER (OFF-SCREEN)
You boys about set?

Dutch and Callaghan look over. Parcher stands wiping his
hands on his jeans. John Clay's blanket-wrapped corpse is
secured to its sling.

DUTCH
We're set.

PARCHER
Good, then get her burning and
let's go.

Parcher turns towards the corpse of the dead Sioux, still
lying face-up on the ground, as Dutch fishes a box of matches
from his vest, gives a handful to Callaghan.

CALLAGHAN (WHISPERING)
This don't seem right.

DUTCH
I don’t like it either. But we
don’t have time. This gets us back
on the trail.

Callaghan doesn't answer, but strikes a match and touches it
to a twist of paper buried in the brush. Dutch does the
same, and soon the poison oak begins to burn and smoke.

Dutch and Callaghan back quickly away, covering their mouths.
BLAM, BLAM. They both jump at the sudden sound of gunfire.
They look back at Parcher, who walks away from the dead
Sioux's corpse with a smoking pistol.

The Sioux's eyes have been shot out of his head.

TIME LAPSE- EXT. BIRCH FOREST- PRE-DAWN

Dutch, Callaghan, and Parcher, with Clay's corpse in tow,
ride away from the quickly growing flames behind them. They

look like emissaries from hell, the reflected firelight
dancing off of the trees' silver bark.
65.

They ride into the forest, quickly leaving sight of
Callaghan's dead horse and the dead, desecrated Sioux.
Clay's traveau bounces roughly along the ground.

The wind carries the deadly yellow-tinged smoke through the
forest behind them, glowing red in the fire.

EXT. NORTHERN PLAINS / FOREST EDGE- DAY

Dutch sits on the ground, using a hatchet to knock the cross-
piece of a small birch crucifix into the riser.

A few yards off, Callaghan and Parcher finish shoveling dirt
onto Clay's grave. Parcher, winded, lowers his shovel and
steps over to Dutch.

PARCHER
Here I thought you ain't had any
religion.

DUTCH
Sorry?

Parcher gestures at Dutch's cross.

DUTCH
So we'll know where he's buried.

Parcher nods, wipes sweat from his brow and grabs an open
bottle of whisky.

PARCHER
You might should think about Jesus.
That Bible's done a lot of good in
the world.

Dutch nods, non-committal.

PARCHER
.-.-And maybe leave off that cross.
If them Indians know a white man's
buried here, they're liable to dig
him up and tear out his eyes, make
him blind in the spirit world.

Parcher looks away, his eyes shining with tears, and takes a
drink. Dutch stands and throws the cross towards the birch

forest. The cross tumbles slowly, end over end through the

sky, and vanishes in the grass.

Parcher sniffs and spits, drinks more whisky. Callaghan
finishes his work and leans on his shovel.
66.

CALLAGHAN
This mean we're heading back?

DUTCH (SURPRISED)
No.

PARCHER
Hell, no. John Clay'd piss on us
from heaven if we turned back now.

DUTCH
And the Stewarts. You said we’re
close.

PARCHER

Yeah. We ride night and day, we
can overtake ‘em on the far side of
those woods, kill the redskin that
shot John and get your woman back.

Dutch mounts his horse. Callaghan pauses, looking down at
Clay's grave.

CALLAGHAN
You want to say some words for Mr.
Clay?

PARCHER (SHAKING HIS HEAD)
That was his job.

EXT. NORTHER PLAINS- DAY

The three ride hard. Callaghan and Dutch have heavy bags
under their eyes. Parcher smokes, eyes narrow and red.

TIME LAPSE- NORTHERN PLAINS- DAY

Dutch rubs his face roughly. His and Callaghan’s horses have
drifted a stone’s throw behind Parcher’s. The three are
riding more slowly now, the need for sleep overtaking them.
Callaghan looks exhausted.

Ahead, Parcher’s head is bowed, eyes closed. He’s asleep on
his horse. Dutch sees it, and looks at Callaghan.

CALLAGHAN
How do you think he does that?
Sleeps on his horse?

DUTCH
I don't know.

Dutch looks up at the glaring sun. His skin is sunburned.
67.

DUTCH
Wish I had my hat.

TIME LAPSE- NORTHERN PLAINS- DUSK

Parcher’s awake again. All three men are bleary-eyed and
pallid, swaying with the motion of their horses. They stare
ahead through heavy lids. There’s a gentle PURRING rolling
in off the plains. Callaghan's eyes creep shut.

Their three horses start to climb a rise. Dutch’s horse
catches up with Parcher’s. Parcher is asleep again.

Dutch turns and looks back towards Callaghan.

Callaghan's gone, the horse he was riding clops along behind
them without a rider.

DUTCH
Hey. Callaghan’s gone.

Parcher snorts awake and looks back. He’s nonchalant--

PARCHER
When did we misplaced our Negro?

DUTCH
While you were sleeping.

PARCHER
I wasn’t asleep.

Dutch turns his horse and spurs it back a few yards.

DUTCH
Callaghan! ...Callaghan!

He looks around; it’s an ocean of grass, the low sun casting
long shadows off the waving blades. Dutch can see for miles
and there’s no sign of Callaghan at all.

The PURRING continues, masked slightly by the GURGLING of a
small stream nearby.

Dutch looks at Parcher, anxiety in his eyes. Either one of
them could have vanished as easily.

Dutch’s horse trots forward, Dutch scanning the grass.
Parcher pulls his horse forward in the background. Callaghan
is simply gone; the grass swallowed him whole.

CALLAGHAN
..-Hey.
68.

Parcher and Dutch turn. No sign of Callaghan, until... he
wearily pushes himself up out of the grass maybe fifteen feet
away, right between the two horses.

PARCHER
Get Walnut back on his horse, we
ain't done yet.

CALLAGHAN (BLEARILY )
That ain't my name.

Dutch gets off his horse, helps Callaghan to his feet.

DUTCH
You alright?

Callaghan nods. Dutch thinks, turns to Parcher.

DUTCH
The horses need water, we need
sleep.

PARCHER

The sun’s setting on John Clay's
grave, and his killer’s still
walking. We keep riding.

DUTCH
The sun’s already set. We each
sleep an hour and watch one. Then
back on the trail.

PARCHER
Get back on your damn horses.

Dutch starts unpacking his blankets from his saddle. Parcher
raises his eyebrows and looks at Callaghan. Callaghan shrugs
and starts unpacking his own blankets.

Parcher gets off his horse, pissed.
EXT. NORTHERN PLAINS CAMP- NIGHT

Callaghan's already asleep. Parcher and Dutch sit by the
fire. Dutch drinks coffee. Parcher stews.

PARCHER
You cross me again, you and Walnut
both can go to hell. I'd rather do
this alone than with a couple old
ladies.

Dutch nods. Beat. Parcher spits, then SIGHS.
69.

PARCHER
Hard to fathom John Clay being
dead. Known that man since we were
little boys.

DUTCH
-.-You’ve gotten people back
before? Women. From the Indians.

Parcher looks at him, sees how worried Dutch is.

PARCHER
Not personally, not alive. But I
met a woman that come back. She
weren’t never the same, but she
lived.

DUTCH
We'll find her.

Dutch looks into the fire. Another moment's silence.

DUTCH
I'll take first watch.

Parcher nods, then GROANS as he gets up and crosses to his
blankets. Dutch holds his rifle across his knees, drinking
coffee and looking out across the plains.

TIME LAPSE- NORTHERN PLAINS CAMP- NIGHT

Dutch shakes Parcher's shoulder. He jerks violently awake,
gets a hand on his revolver before he recognizes Dutch.

PARCHER

Jesus. Dutch.
DUTCH

Parcher, it's your watch.
PARCHER

I ain't been asleep two seconds.
DUTCH

An hour. More. I need sleep.
PARCHER

God damnit.

Parcher GROANS, sits up.

TO BLACK
70.

PALE SHAPES move in inky darkness. RATTLES, PURRING.
TIME LAPSE- NORTHERN PLAINS CAMP- NIGHT

Dutch opens his eyes, sees the campfire blazing unusually
high. Callaghan’s blankets are empty. He rolls away from
the fire, and sees Parcher’s blankets empty. He’s all alone.

Dutch sits up fast. He looks around. The camp is completely
empty. He grabs his pistol, gets to his feet.

The harsh glare of firelight reveals a circle of grass, but
obscures the moonlit ocean of movement beyond.

DUTCH
Callaghan. Parcher.

Dutch squints into the darkness. He takes a step out towards
the grass and stops.

Over the CRACKLING of the fire the nighttime sounds seem
amplified, SHIFTING in the grass. A moment of uncertainty.

We see him from a distance, standing vulnerable in a circle
of firelight, surrounded by infinite darkness. GURGLING
RATTLES slide through darkness.

He tightens his grip on his pistol.

FOOTSTEPS in the grass behind him. Dutch spins. A FIGURE
approaching.

CALLAGHAN
Dutch. I can’t find Parcher.

The figure resolves into Callaghan. Relief sweeps over
Dutch.

DUTCH
...Why’s the fire so big?

CALLAGHAN
I woke up from the heat of it and
Parcher was already gone.
Something’s up.

Callaghan shakes his head. Dutch rubs the sleep out of his
face. He looks around. It hits him.

DUTCH
He's... using us. The Indians see
our fire, attack us. Parcher sees
the Indians.
71.

CALLAGHAN
+..Son of a bitch.

They stand for a moment, looking out into the darkness. Then
Callaghan starts kicking wood away from the fire.

CALLAGHAN
Spread it out, we'll let it die
down .

Dutch kicks from the other side. The fire's quickly lowered,
Dutch and Callaghan left standing over scattered, burning
logs. A beat.

DUTCH
Is there more coffee?

Callaghan shakes his head, no. The insect-like PURRING
that's been rattling off the planes SWELLS.

CALLAGHAN
Do you hear that?

Dutch frowns, straining to listen. The PURRING builds and
drops, hard to distinguish from the swaying of the grass.

CALLAGHAN
It's almost like...

His voice trails off. Dutch listens. A beat.

Parcher SCREAMS, off-screen. Dutch and Callaghan's heads
snap to the sound.

Dutch is the first to move, he grabs a burning piece of wood
and charges into the grass towards the sound of Parcher's
voice, into the darkness. The RATTLING gets louder.

On the edge of Dutch's vision, three figures are crouched on
the ground. Dutch throws his torch.

It arcs end-over-end, sailing through the air, and lands in
the midst of the three. A HISSING SCREAM. The shower of
sparks and muted flame reveals-

TWO BURROWERS crouched over Parcher. The brief light gives us
a glimpse of the creatures, somewhere between a molting
beetle and a drowned child. But only a glimpse.

Dutch raises his rifle.
72.

The Burrowers, out of the torch's light, nearly invisible,
slither like melted wax over the soil. CRACK, CRACK, Dutch
fires his rifle at the creatures. CRACK, CRACK-

THUNK, THUNK, bullets strike the creatures without effect.
They wiggle into the dirt, and in a matter of seconds, vanish
down into it.

Dutch looks at the moonlit grass, collapsing in CIRCULAR
INDENTATIONS where the Burrowers dug down. (Just like the
indentations they’ve found on the trail.)

DUTCH
What... what...

Dutch is on the edge of losing his shit.

PARCHER
My neck.

Dutch looks down. Parcher has a half-inch deep, seven-inch
long TRENCH carved into his neck.

EXT. NORTHERN PLAINS CAMP- NIGHT

Callaghan searches through the saddlebags. Dutch is
standing, looking out at the plains. The PURRING RATTLE is
all around them. Parcher sits by the fire, gingerly touching
the wound on his neck.

CALLAGHAN
Do we have bandages?
PARCHER
It ain't bleeding. I can't even

feel it.

Parcher presses the palm of his hand against the wound, then
takes his hand way and looks at it.

PARCHER
Jesus. Now I can't feel my hand.
What did that Indian do?

DUTCH
Those weren't Indians.

Callaghan pulls a bottle of whiskey and a canteen of water
from the saddlebags, and throws them to Parcher.

CALLAGHAN
Here, clean it out.
73.

Parcher ignores the water, takes a drink of whiskey.
Callaghan spits, mutters-—

CALLAGHAN
...what right you had to stake us
out like pieces of bait.

PARCHER
Listen, I'm the one who's god-damn
cut. Dutch even got a look at ‘em.

DUTCH
Those weren't Indians.

Dutch crosses to the fire, adds a handful of dead grass. The
fire FLARES and in the light they can see the grass moving
around their camp. RATTLES, HISSES. Some of the grass seems
to move against the wind.

The GURGLES and PURRING comes from all directions.

DUTCH
They're all around us.

PARCHER (SLURRED )
I can't feel my face.

DUTCH
I think... they're waiting for us
to go back to sleep.

CALLAGHAN
Fat god-damn chance of that.

TIME LAPSE- EXT. PLAINS CAMP-— NIGHT

The campfire blazes, casting a flickering orange light over
the plains. The three sit in a circle with their backs to
the fire; each holds a gun and watches the plains.

The side of Parcher's face above the wound is starting to
droop like a stroke victim's. They don’t look at one
another, but stare out at the grass as they talk.

PARCHER
Can't feel my tongue. Or much of
my arm. I'm numb but I itch all
over. ...I don't want to die like
this, not by pieces.
74.

DUTCH
I don't think it'll kill you. That
woman we sent back with Dobie, she
was still alive.

PARCHER ( CHUCKLING)
There's cold comfort.

Parcher is still excited, adrenaline giving a shine to his
eyes behind his slightly slackened face. Dutch looks at him,
bewildered that he could find some strange pleasure in this.
Dutch considers, then-

DUTCH
What about Dobie?

Parcher looks up, sobering slightly.

DUTCH
He could be out there alone with
those...

PARCHER
He must be at the fort by now.
(a beat, )

«+-You still got that cross?

DUTCH
Yes...

Dutch fishes it out of his shirt and tosses it to Parcher.
Parcher can't catch it with his numb arm, has to fish around
in the dirt. He picks it up and MURMURS a quick prayer,
kisses the cross.

CALLAGHAN
Can I get some of that?

PARCHER
..-Amen.

Parcher kisses the cross again and tosses it awkwardly to
Callaghan. Callaghan lunges, catches. He kisses it and
MURMURS a prayer. Parcher feels the moist groove in his neck.

CALLAGHAN (TO DUTCH)
Here, man.

Callaghan tosses the cross and Dutch catches it.

DUTCH
Keep it.
75.

CALLAGHAN
What, you don't believe?

Dutch shakes his head.

CALLAGHAN
Then you need it more than I do.

PARCHER
God-damned Indian must have
poisoned the knife.

Dutch pockets the cross.

PARCHER
They been alone in this country
maybe a thousand years. God knows
what devilment they could of
thought of in that time.

DUTCH
I don't think it was an Indian that
cut you.

PARCHER

Looked like men but weren't.
Sneaked up and cut a white man's
throat in the night. Sounds Indian
to me.

They fall silent. The RATTLING and PURRS continue out in the
swaying grass, still strangely SOOTHING. Dutch looks at
Parcher’s wound. Parcher beats his fist against the ground.

PARCHER
Whole... damn... arms is numb.
DUTCH

Your wound is the same as the
Williams’ dead.

Parcher looks at him.
DUTCH
Whoever did that is who took
Maryanne. Took the Stewarts. We
must be close. Can you ride?

Parcher nods, struggles awkwardly to his feet.
76.

PARCHER
Shit. Alright let's go. You don't
get me on a horse soon, I won't be
able to get on at all.

EXT. NORTHERN PLAINS- NIGHT

They ride in a line, Dutch at the lead, followed by Parcher
and Callaghan. All have drawn guns.

The BURROWER NOISES continue from the surrounding plains.
The sky is enormous, filled with stars. Parcher's lip hangs
limp, his eyes heavily lidded.

Dutch rides slowly at the lead, watching the grass.
TIME LAPSE- EXT. SOUTHERN PLAINS— PRE-DAWN

They climb a rise in the land. Dutch is nodding on his
horse, exhausted. Parcher spurs his own horse forward,
alongside the lead.

PARCHER
Dutch.

DUTCH
It's almost light.

PARCHER
Maybe. I'm falling apart.

DUTCH
You'll be alright.

PARCHER
...-If I don't make it back, give
that cross to Ms. Gertrude Spacks
for me. Or give it to Dobie, tell
him it's for his mother.

DUTCH
I’1l do it.

PARCHER
I appreciate it.

CALLAGHAN
A fire.

Dutch looks over, Parcher swings his head over drunkenly.
Callaghan points at a dot of orange light on the horizon.
77.

EXT. SOUTHERN PLAINS-— DAWN

The three riders approach FAITH, an attractive, 19-year-old
Sioux woman sitting alone by a small fire with her rifle.

She watches them steadily with dark, exhausted eyes. Parcher
calls out, his words drunken through his slackened face.

PARCHER(SIOUX, SUB-TITLED)
<Friendly. Peaceful.>

Faith looks at Parcher. Her eyes darken. She traces a
finger on her own neck, mirroring Parcher's wound-

FAITH(SIOUX, S.T.)
<You are marked. Burrowers.>

Parcher looks at her.

CALLAGHAN
What'd she say?

PARCHER
---Told us to set a spell.

TIME LAPSE- EXT. FAITHS' CAMP- DAWN
Faith's face slightly underlit by the dying embers.

FAITH(SIOUX, S.T.)
<Faithful.>

PARCHER(O.S.)
Her name's Faith.

Parcher, Dutch, and Callaghan sit around the dying fire.
Parcher translates with an increasingly bleary voice.

FAITH
<Burrowers killed my family. Last
night I shot my husband so he would
not have to suffer the feeding.>

PARCHER
She's talking about the Burrowers.
Says they killed her family.

CALLAGHAN
Ask her what a Burrower is.

PARCHER(SIOUX, S.T.)
<Burrower. What tribe?>

Faith doesn't even look at him.
78.

FAITH
<They come every third generation.
We tried to escape to the East,
past the Great River. We were
eight .>

PARCHER
<Burrower. What is it?>

Faith looks at him. She seems tired and angry.

FLASHBACK- EXT. PLAINS- DAWN
We fly over empty plains, grasslands extending forever.
FAITH(V.O.)
<They were here before white
people, before humans even. They
feed on buffalo.>

We overcome a herd of BUFFALO, hundreds of them stampeding.

FLASHBACK- EXT. PLAINS- NIGHT
A lone BUFFALO collapses in a heap on the plains.

In the moonlight, a Burrower slithers onto the Buffalo's neck
and RETCHES. It's indiscernible as a pale shadow.

Eight Burrowers, just vague shapes in the darkness, roll the
Buffalo into an open pit.

FAITH(V.O.)
<They bury food, let it rot. The
poisoned cannot sleep.>

EXT. SOUTHERN PLAINS-— DAWN

Dobie's blue eye stares out of the soil. The ground bulges
weakly over his wiggling finger.

PARCHER(V.O.)
They use some kind of poison, bury
their food alive.

Particles of dirt have collected in the moisture on the
surface of Dobie's horribly bloodshot eye. A line of tears
traces down his cheek
79.

EXT. DOBIE'S CAMP- DAY
The mess wagon lays untouched in the clearing. FOUR BUZZARDS
peck at Audrey's corpse, shriveled like a mummy. A buzzard
tears her CLAVICLE free and flies away with it.
EXT. PLAINS- DAY
DUTCH'S DERBY blows by, and out into the grass.
FAITH(V.O.)

<When the blood is thick and the

organs are soft, they return and

eat. They drink.>
FLASHBACK- EXT. PLAINS- NIGHT

Eight Burrowers, half-concealed by grass, surround and cover
the barely disinterred buffalo, mouths fastened onto it.

PARCHER(V.O.)
They eat... soft parts.

EXT. FAITH'S CAMP- MORNING
Parcher's voice smears clumsily through his numb face.

CALLAGHAN
Soft parts? What does that mean?

Parcher shakes his head, he doesn't know.

CALLAGHAN
I like my soft parts. Shit.

FAITH
<You killed the buffalo. So the
Burrowers found other food.>

Faith talks to the ground-
FAITH
<We could not escape sleep. They
took five of us. A baby without a
breast to feed it died yesterday.>
Faith looks at Parcher.
FAITH
<You should die. The sooner you
die, the less you will suffer.>

Parcher doesn't translate this.
80.

PARCHER
<How kill Burrowers? Stop poison?>

Faith shakes her head.

FAITH
<My father said the Ute had fought
them. But the Ute are as wicked as
white men, they will not help.>

PARCHER

Ute Indians know how to kill them.
DUTCH

Does she know how to stop the

poison?

Parcher looks at Dutch, then turns to Faith. He points at
the wound on his neck.

PARCHER
<Heal? Make whole?>

Faith nods.

FAITH
<You can die.>

PARCHER
...The Ute might know.

CALLAGHAN
Where do we find Utes?

PARCHER
There’s probably Ute scouts riding
the same route we’re on, though
they avoid the trails. We can find
‘em a day’s ride North. There’s a
trading post, the Watangwa. If we
can make it there...

DUTCH (INTERRUPTING)
What about the Stewarts?

PARCHER
What about them?

DUTCH
We can’t stop searching so you can
go after your cure.
81.

PARCHER
We find the Utes, they lead us to
the Burrower Tribe. We kill the
Burrowers, you get your girl, go
build that cabin on the prairie,
play American.

Dutch thinks, not sure to trust Parcher.

CALLAGHAN
Is Faith coming with us?

PARCHER
Yeah. That or I'm shooting her.

Parcher smiles at her. She knows better than to smile back.

TIME LAPSE

EXT. SOUTHERN PLAINS- DAY

Dutch watches the landscape roll under his horse. Faith
walks along beside the three horses. Parcher has lashed his
limp left hand to his saddle horn with a cord. He’s grinning,
excited like a kid on an Easter-egg hunt.

Callaghan looks over at Faith, sees that she is beginning to
limp, as if afflicted with blisters.

Dutch looks at Parcher, is a little disturbed by the fierce
not-quite-grin on his face, twisted by his slack muscles.
There's a DARK SPOT on his jaw, like a BED SORE. Parcher
turns his grin on Dutch, who looks away.

EXT. NORTHERN HILLS- DAY

Trees again dot the plains. The land rises and falls in
gentle swells. Stone domes poke through the ground.

Dutch watches Parcher up ahead. A SCARLET BRUISE, like a
blemish on rotting fruit, marks the back of Parcher's neck.
There's a sheen of yellow around it, maybe liquid.

Faith is now riding behind Callaghan, asleep against his
back. Callaghan veers his horse over towards Dutch's.
Parcher is a short distance ahead, out of earshot.

CALLAGHAN
You see that bruise on Parcher's
neck?
82.

DUTCH (NODDING)
On his face and hands, too.

CALLAGHAN
He's falling apart.

DUTCH
The Ute Indians will fix him.

CALLAGHAN
You believe that?

Dutch doesn’t answer.

Callaghan
slick and

CALLAGHAN
I'm thinking maybe I ain't so eager
to risk my hide for that crazy old
shitbird's Indian cure.

DUTCH
We’re not risking anything for him.

CALLAGHAN
You still think you’re gonna find
your girl? That Maryanne Stewart?
What if that’s happening to her?

nods towards Parcher. Dutch looks at the sores,
purple-yellow.

PARCHER(O.S., INTERRUPTING)
What's the ruckus back here?

Parcher has slowed his horse, swerves over to join them.

PARCHER
Thought I mighta heard my name.

CALLAGHAN
Just talking.

PARCHER
You boys look bushed. We're
already in Ute territory. Couple
hours shy of the Watangwa.

Parcher spits. His voice comes out in a drunken slur.

PARCHER
I didn't sleep a wink last night.
Just lay there with my gun, waiting
for something to move.

(MORE)
83.

PARCHER (cont'd)
Whatever them Indians cut me with,
it's got my brain racing like a...
like I was a young man again. I
feel lucky. Makes me wish I could
move my god-damn arms.

Parcher LAUGHS. It's maudlin in his stroke-victim slur.
Dutch and Callaghan exchange a look.

FAITH(SIOUX, S.T.)
<Your wound is spotted.>

Callaghan starts. Nobody realized she was awake. She nods at
the wound on Parcher's neck. The wound is marked with tiny
white fungal dots.

FAITH
<That's how they will find you.>

The grin vanishes from Parcher's slackened face.

CALLAGHAN
What was that?

PARCHER
..-Not a thing.

BLACK ON SCREEN

RATTLES, HISSES, the Burrower PURRING. Pale movement in
darkness, like white worms in black soil.

EXT. NORTHERN HILLS, WATANGWA TRADING POST - DUSK

The three horses and four riders approach a tall POLE driven
into the ground, rags and feathers hanging from the top.

PARCHER
We're here.

Dutch and Callaghan stop their horses. The pole seems to
mark the dead center of nowhere. Rocky, forested hills rise
up around them.

The place looks like desolation, like people have died here,
from ambush, starvation, or both.

DUTCH
What?

PARCHER
The Watangwa. We made it.
84.

CALLAGHAN

Made it? There’s no “here” here.

We’re dead center nowhere.

They’re completely alone, exposed, lost in the sparse trees.

PARCHER

The Utes’1l come. We just gotta

wait. Get me off this horse, my

ass feels like soggy bread.

FAITH
<We shouldn’t stop.>

Dutch gets off of his horse and looks around. Callaghan
climbs off his horse nervously. Faith looks at him.

FAITH
No... <Don’t stop. It’s getting
dark.>

Callaghan looks at her, trying to understand. Faith is
exhausted, gestures weakly as she speaks.

FAITH
<They’11 kill us.>

Callaghan imitates her speech, trying to communicate.

CALLAGHAN (PARROTING)
<They’1l... kill...?>

FAITH
<They’11 kill us all.>

This time he gets it right, no idea what he’s saying-

CALLAGHAN
<They’11 kill us all.>

TIME LAPSE- WATANGWA TRADING POST CAMP - NIGHT

CALLAGHAN (0O.S. )
Your watch, man, I need sleep.

Dutch blearily opens his eyes. Callaghan is crouching over
him, speaking low enough so only Dutch can hear.

CALLAGHAN
The old man's still awake.

Dutch nods, and sits up from his blankets.
85.

TIME LAPSE- EXT. NORTHERN HILLS CAMP- NIGHT

Dutch sits by the campfire with a rifle across his knees,
watching the plains. The RATTLING is soft, but it's there.
Dutch looks absolutely exhausted.

PARCHER (SLURRED )
Your eyes open, bud?

Parcher is lying on his back by the fire, heavy-lidded eyes
staring upwards. The BRUISING on Parcher's face is worse,

spreading nearly to his left eye. His left hand is nearly

black. He's rotting alive.

PARCHER

Dutch. You hear me, Dutch?
DUTCH

I'm awake.
PARCHER

Real good. You stay that way.

DUTCH
I'll tell you if I fall asleep.

PARCHER
Much appreciated.

Dutch throws another piece of wood onto the fire.

PARCHER
You think that boy and his squaw
are gonna try to leave us?

DUTCH
-.-No.

PARCHER
I'd sure hate to have to shoot
somebody for trying to abandon me
out here.

Dutch stirs the fire. With each SWELL in the BURROWER
RATTLE, Dutch's eyelids are tugged downward.

PARCHER
You hear what I'm saying?

DUTCH
No, I'm asleep.
86.

Parcher grins with the half of his mouth he can move. The
PURRING from out in the grass swells, Dutch's eyes go a
little glassy.

Dutch yawns. Parcher grins. The Burrower PURRING swells
again, tugging at Dutch's consciousness. Dutch lets his lids
droop downward. A beat.

The CLICK of a cocked his pistol. Dutch's eyes snap open-

Parcher is turned, watching the grass on the edge of camp
behind them. It MOVES against the wind, in time with the
Burrower RATTLING. Parcher's revolver weaves drunkenly at
the movement. Dutch raises his rifle.

The two gun barrels track the grass' movement, slowly across
the circumference of camp. Neither Parcher nor Dutch notices
behind them-

A PALE FIGURE rising from the earth on the far side of camp,
between Callaghan and Faith. The RATTLING grows.

The grass moving before Dutch and Parcher pauses, then cuts
back the way it came. Stalks of grass collapse.

Background, out of focus- The Burrower stalking Callaghan
arrives over him, and draws back a clawed hand. Loose earth
falls from its back and PATTERS softly on the ground.

Dutch's eyes dart back at the sound. He YELLS and spins,
raising the rifle. Callaghan opens his eyes and SCREAMS.

CRACK, CRACK, Dutch fires. The second bullet hits the
Burrower and it HISSES, retreating into the grass.

The grass behind Parcher and Dutch collapses, and a SECOND
BURROWER emerges, slinking swiftly towards Dutch.

Callaghan scrambles to his feet, likewise Faith.

BLAM, Parcher fires his pistol limply into the earth, nearly
throwing the gun from his rotting hand. Dutch turns at the
sound and finds-

A GAPING MAW. A toothless mouth as big around as a baby's
head, strung with mucous and bile, like a hole punched in a
sheet of melted cheese.

The Burrower's head is mottled yellow and brown flesh, the
eyes tiny, subterranean pink, too far apart. The flesh is
plated, but soft, like a boiled insect.
87.

Dutch throws himself backwards, towards the fire, CRACK,
CRACK, firing his rifle into the creature. It jerks
backwards, HISSING.

Callaghan grabs his pistol off the ground. Faith scrambles
towards the fire.

Parcher turns drunkenly towards Callaghan and raises his
pistol. Movement in the grass behind Callaghan.

Dutch fires, CRACK, CRACK, into the Burrower before him as it
insinuates itself into the earth and vanishes.

BLAM, BLAM, Parcher fires his pistol at the Burrower behind
Callaghan. BLAM, on Parcher's third shot, Callaghan YELLS
and drops, holding his leg.

Faith grabs the dropped pistol.

Sudden silence but for Callaghan's PAINED BREATHING and the
dwindling PURR of the retreating Burrowers.

DUTCH
Callaghan.

Dutch runs to him. He pulls his belt tight around
Callaghan's leg, staunching the flow of blood.

PARCHER
Did you see those things? Jesus
Christ.

Parcher is glassy-eyed excited, gun in hand, barely able to
prop himself up. He's almost laughing.

CALLAGHAN
You shot me, goddamnit.

Dutch struggles to tie off the impromptu tourniquet, his
hands slick with blood. Callaghan HISSES in pain.

PARCHER
I saved your life, boy.

Callaghan holds his bleeding leg and stares at Parcher.

FAITH
<Put more wood on the fire.>

PARCHER
Put wood on the fire, she says.
88.

Dutch picks up his rifle in one hand and uses the other to
toss more wood on the fire. The firelight jumps, but does
little to penetrate the forested hills.

FAITH
<We should go. We should keep
moving. They’ll find him by his
wound.>

She points at Parcher.
FAITH
<We leave him, he’s already dead.
We need to go.>

Dutch looks at Faith, shakes his head-

DUTCH
I don’t understand.
FAITH
<We must go. We keep moving or we

die.>

DUTCH (TO PARCHER)
What’s she saying?

PARCHER
Nonsense. The squaw’s hysterical.

Dutch shakes his head. He takes Faith’s hands and lifts
them. He gestures.

DUTCH
Use hands. Sign.

PARCHER
Oh great Christ.

Dutch ignores him. Faith gestures to Callaghan, Dutch, and
the horses, then makes a moving gesture, thrusting a hand
back out of the trees.

CALLAGHAN
She wants us to go.

Callaghan, Parcher, and Faith are all looking at Dutch. His
decision is going to determine their course.

DUTCH
What do you think?
89.

PARCHER
No! You’re not gonna listen to
that red-skinned bitch!

Dutch looks at Parcher, makes his decision.

DUTCH
She knows more than we do.
(to Callaghan)
Can you ride?

CALLAGHAN
I don't know. If you get me ona
horse, yeah, maybe.

PARCHER
Like hell.

Parcher dumps the spent cartridges from his gun. He shoves a
fresh round into one the five chambers.

Dutch starts towards him. Parcher shuts the breach and
raises the pistol. Dutch stops.

PARCHER
We're staying right god-damn here.

Dutch looks at him, he’s only six steps away, and Parcher’s
barely able to lift the pistol. He steps forward.

Parcher pulls the trigger. CLICK. Dutch lunges forward.
Parcher pulls the trigger, CLICK. And again...

Dutch yanks the gun out of his hand before the hammer can
fall. Parcher flails his arm and YELLS like a toddler ina
tantrum. (Like a half-paralyzed, rotting toddler in a
tantrum.) He catches his breath, then-

PARCHER
God damn you to hell, Dutch.
EXT. NORTHERN HILLS- NIGHT
The four riders lope along in a line. Faith behind Callaghan
at the lead, nearly holding him in the saddle. Parcher
slumped on his horse, hands tied at the wrist to the pommel.

Dutch brings up the rear, weary.

Their horses pick their way slowly through the darkness.
Callaghan sweats, grimacing with each bounce of his horse.

Dutch watches the moonlit landscape, silvery and dim.
90.

PARCHER
You boys better hope to God I die.

Nobody answers.

FAITH
<More blood is coming.>

She says it to Callaghan, gesturing to his leg. Blood is
dribbling off the heel of his boot. He's near the point of
falling unconscious. He pauses, calls out-

CALLAGHAN
...Dutch. We gotta do something
about my leg.

He reins his horse to a halt. Ahead, Parcher grins through
his stroke-victim face.

EXT. NORTHERN HILLS GULCH- NIGHT

Dutch adjusts the flame on a second lantern, the two small
fires together casting an ellipse of weak light.

He leaves his rifle by the lanterns, stands, and crosses to
Callaghan's horse, which Faith holds by the reigns.

DUTCH
Here.

Dutch reaches up and helps Callaghan off the horse.
Callaghan leans heavily on Dutch's shoulders, grimacing and
hissing with pain. He YELLS when his left leg touches
ground. His right leg hangs limp, soaked with blood.

Parcher watches, almost amused. Then he looks past them, out
into the darkness.

Suddenly, yelled from outside the firelight-
UTE VOICE(O.S., YELLING)
Good Indian! Peaceful! Good
Indian!

All eyes snap towards the sound.

Dutch looks at his rifle. It's ten feet away, by the
lanterns; he can't grab it without dropping Callaghan.

TWO UTE WARRIORS walk into the circle of lantern light. One
is Tall, the other Short. The short one points at himself.
91.

SHORT UTE
Good Indian.
(Ute, s.t.)

<Are you able to speak?>

Nobody responds. Both Ute are armed with RIFLES slung around
their backs. The Shorter Ute has three BEARTRAPS on his belt.

SHORT UTE
No English.

Dutch looks towards his rifle, then back at the Ute.

CALLAGHAN (WHISPERING)
Drop me. Get the rifle.

FAITH(SIOUX, S.T.)
<Ute.>

PARCHER
Praise God, He sent us some Utes.
I don't know any Ute words.

SHORT UTE
Frangais?

DUTCH (FRENCH, S.T.)
<Yes. I speak French.>

SHORT UTE(FRENCH, S.T.)
<Good. To speak French. We...
good Indian. Friends.>

DUTCH
<We look for a missing white
family. Burrowers took them.>

The Tall Ute leans down and MURMURS something to the Short
one. He nods towards Parcher.

CALLAGHAN (WHISPERING)
Get your rifle.

DUTCH(LOW, TO CALLAGHAN)
Can you stand?

CALLAGHAN
Drop me.

The Short Ute addresses Dutch again, pointing at Parcher.
92.

SHORT UTE
<Dead man. We are to fix. Little
fish? We come from south. We
hunt. Little fish to hunt with.>

DUTCH
He says they can fix you.
Something about a small fish.
<I don't understand.>

The Tall Ute is moving towards Parcher.

PARCHER
Stay back! Tell him to stay back!

The Short Ute shows his palms, trying to calm Parcher. The
Tall Ute keeps advancing. He pulls a bundle of TROPHIES from
his belt, hanging on a loop of rawhide. They are trinkets,
jewelry, snatches of cloth.

TALL UTE
<Little fish. We use the sick as
Little fish, understand?>

He shakes the bundle of trophies.

TALL UTE
<From the sick.>

DUTCH
He keeps saying Little Fish.

PARCHER (REALIZING)
Jesus Christ amighty. He's talking
about bait.

CALLAGHAN
Drop me.

The Tall Ute reaches up and grabs the ropes binding Parcher's
wrists to the saddle.

Dutch drops Callaghan and dives for his rifle. Callaghan
CRIES OUT in pain.

Parcher gives a slurred YELL as he's yanked off the horse and
onto the ground, the Tall Ute holding him. Parcher flails at
the Tall Ute, knocking the hoop of trophies from his hand.

The trophies fall to the ground.
93.

Dutch gets a hand around his rifle when BLAM, the earth is
kicked up two feet from him. Faith SCREAMS. The Short Ute
is pointing his rifle at him.

SHORT UTE
<To take the Little Fish. We fix.>

Dutch stays frozen over his rifle. Callaghan half-lies on
the ground, holding his bleeding leg.

PARCHER
Shoot this son of a bitch! Pick up
your god-damned rifle and shoot
this son of a bitch!

"Shoo zis sunuvabish" is how the words come out, slurred
almost beyond understanding by now. The Short Ute holds his
rifle on them as the Tall Ute drags Parcher across camp and
past him, into the darkness.

SHORT UTE
<Little Fish already dead. Little
Fish for trap. To kill.>

PARCHER (OVERLAPPING)
God damn you, Dutch! Don't let
them take me! You killed me, you
son of a bitch!

Parcher and the Tall Ute are already out of the light of the
fire and out of sight. The Short Ute, holding the rifle on
them, begins to back out of the firelight.

SHORT UTE
<We are to fix. We are to kill.>

The Short Ute backs into darkness and vanishes.

Dutch stares into the darkness, the Short Ute could still be
just beyond the firelight, still pointing the rifle.

CALLAGHAN
Are they gone?

DUTCH
I don't know.

A beat. Dutch is the first to move. He crouches down and
picks up the loop of trophies.

FAITH
<We leave. He is already dead. We
leave now.>
94,

A dozen trinkets taken from dead settlers, belt buckles,
jewelry, crosses. In between each trinket, there hangs a
small grayish-white bone, like half of a child's jaw,
toothless, non-human.

CALLAGHAN
I hope you’re not thinking of going
after him.

DUTCH
They said they could fix him. Or
trap...

Dutch falls silent, staring at the trinkets in his hand. His
mouth opens a little, tears shine in his eyes.

DUTCH
Oh god.

In Dutch’s hand, hanging from the Ute’s trophy cord, is
Maryanne Stewart’s BROOCH. Dutch leans against the horse and
closes his eyes. Callaghan watches him.

CALLAGHAN
Dutch...?

Dutch takes a breath.

DUTCH
She's dead.

He stares off into the trees. Several moments- Dutch looks
on the edge of falling apart; exhausted, heart-broken.
Callaghan waits to speak-

CALLAGHAN
Let’s go.

DUTCH
I have to go after Parcher.

CALLAGHAN
Like hell you do. That sunuva
bitch was dead ‘fore them Indians
even touched him.

DUTCH
It’s not for him. We don’t know
how to heal the Burrowers poison.
We don’t know to kill them.

CALLAGHAN
I want to go home.
95.

We can see that Dutch wants to go home just as badly. He
puts the brooch in his pocket. He takes a breath.

DUTCH
They took Maryanne from her home.
Home isn’t safe.

Callaghan looks at him. Dutch holds his gaze. Callaghan,
wearily, nods.

TIME LAPSE- EXT. NORTHERN HILLS GULCH- NIGHT
Dutch pulls Parcher's pistol from his saddle.

Callaghan pushes himself painfully into a sitting position
against a saddle lying on the ground. Faith paces nearby,
watching the edges of camp. She throws another piece of wood
on the fire. Dutch crosses to Callaghan and crouches.

DUTCH
You be alright?

CALLAGHAN
No. You hurry back. I think
she’ll watch out for me, but...

Callaghan gestures towards Faith. Dutch stands, crosses to
Faith, and hands her Parcher’s rifle.

DUTCH
Stay? Watch out for him.

Dutch points at Callaghan. Tries to pantomime the sentence.
Faith takes the rifle, and nods slightly.

CALLAGHAN (TO DUTCH)
Be careful.

Dutch takes up his own rifle and nods again. He looks
frightened but determined. He takes a breath and walks away
from camp, out of the light of the fire.

EXT. NORTHERN HILLS- NIGHT

The starlight shines somewhere between silver and lead,
everything nearly black and white in the dim illumination.
It could be a daguerreotype. Luminous white-barked birch.

Dutch moves through the trees cautiously, rifle in one hand
and pistol in the other. He squints into the darkness.
96.

WIND moves the small trees, shifting shadows dancing over the
blowing grass. Burrower RATTLES come and go from seemingly
every direction.

TIME LAPSE

Dutch moves deeper into the trees. He seems to be moving
towards and away from the Burrower RATTLE at the same time.

RUNNING FOOTSTEPS crunch dead leaves. Dutch spins, just as-
The Short Ute arrives and CLOCKS Dutch across the face with
the butt of his rifle. Dutch drops his rifle and falls to
the earth. The Short Ute lands on top of him, hand clamped
over his mouth.

SHORT UTE(FRENCH, S.T.)
<Silence.>

CLICK, of a revolver being cocked. The Ute looks down.
Dutch's revolver is pointed at his chest. BLAM.
The Ute falls backwards, dead before he hits the ground.

Dutch scrambles to his feet. The Ute doesn't move. Silence,
his smoking gun. He looks around. Nobody but the dead Ute.

Parcher MOANS from somewhere nearby. It's a low, weak sound,
nearly a death-rattle.

Dutch turns and runs in a crouch towards the sound. He keeps
his head low, pistol and rifle ready. He jogs through small
trees, CRUNCHING through dead leaves, rises a hill and finds-
EXT. NORTHERN HILLS CLEARING- NIGHT

A bare expanse of rocky earth, surrounded by trees.

Dutch passes a pile of SHARPENED POLES, 12-foot birch spears
lying piled at the clearing's edge.

In the center, Parcher is lying face-up on a slab of rock,
his arms and legs bound by ropes pegged to the ground.
Burrower PURRS and RATTLES surround the clearing.

Dutch moves cautiously out towards Parcher.

PARCHER
Jesus, Dutch. Thank God.

Dutch leans down over him and unties Parcher's good arm.
97.

PARCHER
They put something in me. Made me
drink...

DUTCH

Drink? What was it?

Dutch reaches across to untie Parcher's rotten arm. Parcher
glances past Dutch and GASPS.

Dutch follows Parcher's eyes, glancing over his shoulder.

Parcher LURCHES upward and GRABS the pistol from Dutch's
waist, pointing it at the TALL UTE suddenly behind Dutch.

BLAM, Parcher FIRES the gun, inches from Dutch's face. The
muzzle flash SEARS across Dutch's eyes, he falls backwards.

A bullet wound PUNCTURES the belly of the Tall Ute.
DUTCH'S POV- Washed-out, overexposed, a RINGING in his ears.

Dutch stumbles backwards, holding his flash-blinded eyes.
His left foot pushes through a pile of dead leaves and SNAP,
a BEAR TRAP springs up, biting his ankle.

Dutch SCREAMS and falls to the ground.

The Tall Ute is half crab-walking, half dragging himself
away, bleeding heavily from the gut. Parcher holds the
pistol on him blearily, his arm swaying.

Dutch is close to shock, his POV bleached nearly white.

The Ute, near the edge of the clearing, lets himself
collapse, holding his belly. Parcher lets the pistol drop
and lies back on the rock.

Dutch wedges his fingers beneath the jaws of the bear trap.
He pulls, straining. The jaws begin to separate... then a
fingernail tears and the trap SNAPS shut again.

DUTCH (PAIN)
shit!

FROM ABOVE- The Ute lies bleeding near the clearing's edge.
Parcher lies tethered by three points to a rock. Dutch sits
struggling to free his leg from the bear trap. SIX
INDENTATIONS appear in the rocky soil, churning.

SIX BURROWERS emerge into the clearing. They slink like
cats, moving on all fours.
98.

They cast their heads towards the Ute, and Dutch, then focus
in on Parcher and spiral in towards him.

Parcher is the first to see them. He GASPS.

Parcher weakly lifts the dropped gun and BLAM, fires once
before the first two Burrowers are on him.

Dutch looks up at the sound, just in time to see the other
four Burrowers FLING themselves onto Parcher. They fasten
their gaping maws onto his body like piglets on a sow.

Parcher opens his mouth to scream, but the only sound that
comes out is the dying WHEEZE of a broken bellows. The
Burrowers arch their backs and suck, SLURPING the rotten
organs from Parcher's body.

A Burrower pulls its pale head away from the buffet, its face
dripping with blood and gore, as if fresh from a pie-eating
contest. It swings its head towards Dutch.

Dutch, still tethered by the bear trap, looks at the
creature. It HISSES with a blood-and-mucous strung mouth.

Dutch crabwalks backwards, away from the Burrower, pulling
the trap's tethering chain nearly taught before he FREEZES.
He looks down at his left hand, a SECOND BEAR TRAP waits
beneath a thin covering of leaves.

The Burrower starts slinking towards him. The thick yellow
nails on it's three-fingered hands drip white venom.

Dutch looks from the bear trap blocking his path to the
approaching creature. It’s ten feet away. It tenses to
pounce, HISSING, then FLINGS itself at Dutch.

Dutch YELLS, and catches the Burrower's hand, the dripping
talons inches from his neck. He twists, pushing the creature
onto the SECOND BEAR TRAP.

The trap SNAPS, CRUNCHING into the Burrower's side. The
Burrower ARCHES and SCREACHES in pain.

Dutch rolls away, and from the ground grabs a STICK, arm-
length, about two inches around. He wedges it into the jaws
of the trap holding his ankle, and pries it apart.

The trapped Burrower, arm's length from Dutch, LUNGES at him,
swiping. Dutch YANKS his leg free and rolls away, the
venomous claw missing him by inches.

TALL UTE (UTE, SUB-TITLED)
<No!>
99,

Dutch looks over. Another BURROWER is slinking towards the
gut-shot Ute, talons dripping. The Ute cries out.

Dutch LURCHES to his feet, his wounded ankle nearly giving
out, and limps to intercept the creature before it reaches
the Ute.

One of the Burrowers still feeding on Parcher suddenly lifts
its head and HISSES. It stumbles back from Parcher,
drunkenly, and then collapses to the ground.

The other three Burrowers raise their bloody maws from
Parcher's drained corpse and look over. The unconscious
Burrower lies on the ground, sucking small, shallow breaths
like an asthmatic child.

The Burrower bearing down on the wounded Ute weaves
drunkenly, but is only paces away. PANTING with pain, Dutch
grabs a SHARPENED POLE from the pile on the ground.

The Burrower raises back a claw, ready to swipe at the Ute.
Dutch lunges, PLUNGING the birch pole through the Burrower's
torso and into the ground below. The creature SCREECHES.

The bear-trap Burrower's eyes are closed, it pushes weakly
against the ground.

The three Burrowers over Parcher stumble away, drunkenly.
The Burrower speared to the ground wearily lolls its head.

DUTCH
+-.-You poisoned them.

The Ute, breathing through clenched teeth, almost grins.

One-by-one, the Burrowers collapse blearily to the ground,
unconscious. Barely standing, Dutch watches them fall.

All six creatures lie unconscious, smeared with Parcher's
dark blood, breathing shallowly.

Dutch tries to catch his breath.

Parcher's body is an empty husk, pale white and mummified.
His chest and belly collapsed like a sunken soufflé.

DUTCH
Heavenly god.

The gut-shot Ute is weakly trying to CALL OUT.

Standing over an unconscious Burrower, Dutch gets our first
real clear look at the creatures:
100.

Humanoid. Three thick fingers on each hand ending in thick,
black, curled nails. A half-dozen small, vestigial, beetle-
looking TALONS, like Alaskan crab legs, line its torso
beneath the arms.

It has tiny, puckered eyes. Mucous-strung mouths as big
around as softballs. Completely hairless. A soft
exoskeleton, like a molting insect's, over mottled, rotten-
looking flesh, a stark contrast against the crimson stains on
their cheeks and chins.

Gooey strings of Parcher's blood blow in and out of the
things' mouths in time with their RASPING BREATH.

The Tall Ute CALLS OUT to Dutch, barely more than a directed
MOAN. Dutch looks over.

The Tall Ute's tunic is nearly black with blood in the
moonlight. The Ute points across the clearing.

Dutch's gaze follows the Ute's hand to the pile of BIRCH
SPEARS, the sharpened poles at the clearing's edge.

Dutch picks one up. The Tall Ute nods, and points at the
Burrower Dutch speared, pinning to the ground. Then he
points at the other unconscious creatures, pantomiming
thrusting spears into them.

Dutch limps over to the nearest Burrower, holds the spear
over it, and looks at the Ute. The Ute nods desperately.

Dutch kicks the Burrower onto its back, raises the spear, and
PLUNGES it downward into the thing's chest.

The Ute pumps his fist, pantomiming driving the stake down
deeper. Dutch twists the spear and pushes it through the
Burrower, down several feet into the ground.

The Burrower twists with the pressure and BILE dribbles from
its mouth.

The Ute looks towards the East, where the first gray light of
dawn is appearing. He turns back to Dutch and points at the
other Burrowers.

Dutch nods, limps over and grabs two more spears.

He kicks the second Burrower onto its back and drives the
stake through its chest and into the ground. He drives a
stake into the third Burrower.

The Ute nods, relieved, and collapses onto his back, PANTING.
Dutch impales the fourth Burrower. The fifth, and the sixth.
101.

Dutch stands, the Burrowers are STILL BREATHING. Blood and
mucous shakes on their lips with every exhale.

DUTCH
It didn't work.
(French, s.t.)
<It didn't work>

The Ute doesn't look at him.

DUTCH
<They're still alive.>
The Ute doesn't respond. Dutch is
exhausted and all fucked up, looks
like he's about to cry. He walks
over to Parcher. Parcher's corpse
looks frail as a baby bird.
Dutch crouches down and grabs
Parcher's corpse from under the
arms. He lifts him, and starts to
drag him away.
He pulls him back six or seven feet
before Parcher's boot catches on a
rock. Dutch pulls and Parcher's
withered left arm TEARS OFF.
Dutch falls onto his ass with the
mummified limb in his hand. He
YELLS and drops it, scrambles
backwards, and comes to a rest
sitting on the ground.
Dutch sits there. He stares at the
ground. He looks at the gut-shot
Ute lying on the ground. Dutch
looks back at the ground and sits.
SUNLIGHT hits him. Dutch looks up.
The first rays of dawn cresting the
horizon.
The ASTHMATIC WHEEZING quickens,
becomes more urgent.

The Burrowers are stirring, limbs moving over the ground.
The sun climbs a little higher over the horizon. Light is
now falling directly on the six creatures.

They WHEEZE and HISS, there is a faint SIZZLING. One
Burrower opens its maw and lets loose a high-pitched sound
like a DOG WHISTLE. It raises its arms to the spear pinning
it to the ground.

The others come fully awake, HISSING and SCREAMING.

Dutch watches. The Burrowers' skin pulls tight in the
sunlight, STEAM rises off of it.
102.

A Burrower digs at the ground, uselessly scratching at the
earth.

TINY BLISTERS appear on their yellowish flesh.

A Burrower, SCREAMING, pulls at the stake pinning it to the
ground, actually lifting itself off the earth.

The gut-shot Ute watches with fierce satisfaction.

Burrower skin SIZZLES and CRACKS in the sunlight. BILE
bubbles up from their mouths. They STEAM and SCREAM, flesh
falls from their bodies in blistering scraps. The Burrowers
writhe on the ground, their flesh burning away. Huge
BLISTERS rise and break.

Dutch watches as they SCREAM and fall to pieces.

By the time it's done, the Burrowers’ corpses look like BURNT
CHILDREN staked to the earth.

Dutch, bathed in sunlight, sitting on the ground between
Parcher's corpse and Parcher's arm, wipes the tears from his
eyes with bloody hands.

FADE TO BLACK
EXT. NORTHERN HILLS CAMP- DAWN
Callaghan is sitting and Faith pacing where we left them.

Dutch, holding the Ute's arm around his shoulder, stumbles
into camp. The Ute's feet barely drag on the ground, his
whole torso dark with blood. He's pale, but conscious.

TIME LAPSE- MORNING

They have the Ute laid out on blankets, taking shallow
breaths. Faith is gently tying strips of blanket around the
still-seeping wound in his stomach.

Callaghan and Dutch sit nearby. Dutch drinks coffee.

DUTCH
It was sunlight. Burned them
alive. The Ute poisoned them. Put
something in Parcher that would
make the Burrowers sleep.

CALLAGHAN
Parcher's dead?
(Dutch nods.)
I'll miss him.
103.

It's not a convincing performance. A beat, then-

DUTCH
I don't know what the poison was.

Callaghan looks at the gut-shot Ute.

CALLAGHAN
Can he talk?
DUTCH
I don't think so. ...If he dies we

won't find the poison.

CALLAGHAN
Shit. Nothing's easy.

DUTCH
I can make it to Fort Bismark and
back with a doctor in two days.

CALLAGHAN (RE: THE UTE)
You think he can live that long?

DUTCH
I don't know. What about you?

CALLAGHAN
-..Get to it. The longer you wait
the deader we get. And you better
stay dead South. You miss that
fort by a few miles, you'll be lost
for days.

Dutch nods with heavy eyes. He wants nothing but sleep.

CALLAGHAN
And if you gotta sleep, sleep in
the day, you hear me?

DUTCH
I won’t sleep.

Faith, her hands red with the Ute's blood, watches Dutch and
Callaghan. Callaghan reaches out a hand, Dutch takes it and
they shake.

Faith cradles the wounded Ute’s head in her lap. He blearily
tries to speak, but can’t. Faith is close to tears.

The Ute weakly points at Callaghan and Dutch, then covers his
ears with his hands. Tears roll down his face. Faith
cradles his head in her lap.
104.

EXT. SOUTHERN PLAINS— MORNING

The rising sun finds Dobie's blue eye, slightly clouded over,
staring up at the deep blue sky.

EXT. NORTHERN PLAINS TO SOUTHERN PLAINS- VARIOUS / MONTAGE

POUNDING HOOVES. From morning to noon to night, Dutch pushes
his horse hard across the sparse plains, Clay’s horse
galloping on a rope tied behind. He switches horses to keep
up his speed, eyes raccooned with exhaustion.

EXT. SOUTHERN PLAINS- NIGHT

Dutch rides, exhausted, world tilting carnival around him.
Burrower RATTLES swell out of the grass around him. The small
GOLD CRUCIFIX, marked with WHITE GROWTHS, bounces inside
Dutch’s breast pocket. The grasslands are watching him.

EXT. SOUTHERN PLAINS- DAWN
A red sun crests the horizon.

ON THE GROUND- Dobie’s eye stares out over the plains.

DOBIE’S POV- through the grass, Dobie sees a horse and rider
approaching.

UNDERGROUND- Dobie’s finger wiggles furiously.

The rider is crossing Dobie’s sight diagonally. He gets
close enough that we can see that it’s Dutch. We see hope in
Dobie’s unmoving eye. Underground, his finger wiggles
desperately.

ON DUTCH- He reins his horse to a stop forty feet from Dobie,
looking down at the grass. He grins a little bit and we seen
what got his attention-- Dutch’s HAT, suspended in the grass.
He swings down, grabs the hat, and jams it onto his head.

ON THE GROUND- Dobie watches Dutch climb back on his horse
and ride away.

EXT. SOUTHERN PLAINS- AFTERNOON

Dutch stands, waving his arms at a MILITARY TRAIN, a dozen

Bluecoat soldiers and a mess wagon marching Northward. TWO
RIDERS break away from the train and head towards him.
105.

INT. ARMY BARRACKS- NIGHT

CLOSE UP on Dutch's face, exhausted but at least cleaned up,
eating. He watches the OFFSCREEN SOLDIERS talk-

SOLDIER(O.S.)
I can't rightly say, sir. He says
Will Parcher was killed, and
another man named Clay.

LIEUTENANT (0.S.)
Does he know the tribe that
attacked him?

SOLDIER(O.S.)
No, sir. He's a foreigner, sir.
Might be simple.

EXT. SOUTHERN PLAINS-— MORNING

Dutch sits on a wagon, his left ankle thickly bandaged. He's
cleaned up, in fresh clothes. A black DRIVER and a DOCTOR
sits in the wagon behind them. Six BLUECOATS ride alongside,
along with an OGLALA SCOUT.

Dutch holds a cane across his lap and watches the prairie
ahead of them, anxious to return to his friends-

EXT. NORTHERN HILLS / MILITARY CAMP- DUSK
Faith and the Tall Ute hang dead from an impromptu GALLOWS.

The blood from his stomach wound tracing his legs show that
the Tall Ute was still alive when they strung him up.

Dozens of BLUECOATS mill around, setting up camp.

Standing by the wagon, leaning on his cane, Dutch stares
slack-jawed at Faith and the Tall Ute's corpses. His eyes
shine with tears.

Campfires burn all around him, throughout the trees, a
pleasant glow in the quickly fading light.

HENRY VICTOR(0.S.)
Parcher's German! Hey, Parcher's
German!

Dutch turns, Henry Victor walks quickly and warmly towards
him, rubbing his hands together with satisfaction.
106.

HENRY VICTOR
My god, man. They told me you were
here. I'm afraid you were too late
for Will Parcher.

DUTCH
I know.

HENRY VICTOR
What the hell’d them Indians do?
We buried him proper, though. Man
was wiser'n I gave him credit.
Took four days and no small pain to
get them Sioux to tell us what
Parcher guessed right off. We've
got scouts routing out the Ute to
the North as we speak. Were able
to clear just about every last one
of them from this land. Reg'lar
Indians: they could whoop to beat
the band but can't fight for shit.

DUTCH
Where's Callaghan?

HENRY VICTOR
Who, now?

DUTCH
He was your cook. He was with...

HENRY VICTOR
Walnut! He would have owed me his
life if he had survived.

DUTCH
What?

HENRY VICTOR
Amputated his leg and he up and
died on us. Man was delirious,
halucinating, never really woke.

Tears creep down Dutch's cheeks. Henry Victor's talking to
himself, barely notices Dutch is there.

HENRY VICTOR
‘Course we never did find them
Stewarts. Doubt we ever will, were
probably dead before we even
started looking. I guess all we
can really do is make sure it never
happens again.
107.

Dutch looks at the ground, crying.

EXT. SOUTHERN PLAINS-— MORNING

Dutch rides Parcher's horse away from a dozen BLUECOAT
SOLDIERS riding South.

EXT. WASHBURNE CRICK - DAY

We see the settlement from out in the plains, alone ina
world of grass. The houses are still unoccupied.

We tilt down and reveal six SUNKEN PATCHES in the ground.
They’re graves, recently robbed. If we look closely, we can
see scraps of bone and withered skin in the grass. A piece
of lace from one of the Stewart children’s nightgowns.

They were buried less than a 1/4 mile from their homes.

EXT. THE SPACKS HOUSE- DAY

Dutch rides towards the large Victorian home. He eyes the
approaching home with trepidation.

EXT. THE SPACKS HOUSE PORCH- DAY

Gertrude, wiping her hands on her apron, opens the door and
finds Dutch standing with his hat in hand. Dutch inhales to
begin speaking...

INT. GERTRUDE'S PARLOR- DAY

Dutch perches uncomfortably on a wing-back chair as Gertrude
WEEPS softly, sitting on the sofa opposite.

This has been going on for some time. Dutch holds his hat on
his knees, moving his hands along the brim.

The GOLD CRUCIFIX dangles by its chain from Gertrude's hands.
Gertrude gets control, wipes at her face with a kerchief.

GERTRUDE
Have you had lunch, Mr. Leijderova?

EXT. THE SPACKS HOUSE- AFTERNOON
Dutch carries a picnic basket, walking next to Gertrude, who

carries a blanket. They walk towards the box elder tree
where the earlier picnic took place.
108.

GERTRUDE
Dobie's still alive.

DUTCH
I think so, too.

GERTRUDE
It's not a thinking matter. A
mother would know. My son will
come back to me.

The GOLD CRUCIFIX is looped around Gertrude's neck.

GERTRUDE
Do you like pineapple?
DUTCH
I don't know.
GERTRUDE
I think you will. Parcher loved
pineapple.
She pauses.
GERTRUDE

I’m sorry about Maryanne.

(Dutch nods)

Her poor family... I don't want to
feel guilty. I think our duty is to
live as well as we can. It gives
reason to the sacrifices that men
like Parcher and you made. A lot of
Americans died so we could make a
life here. It would be a sin if we
didn't.

They arrive in the shade of the Box Elder. Gertrude fingers
the gold cross. It’s still spotted with tiny WHITE GROWTHS.

EXT. THE SOUTHERN PLAINS- NIGHT

The grass moves in amber waves across the slowly sloping
land. The cloudless sky casts clear, stark, starlight down
onto the plains. Dobie is pulled from the earth by a dozen
hungry hands. He’s still alive, still awake when the feeding
begins.

THE END
