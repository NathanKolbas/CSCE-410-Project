FADE IN:

INT. GUARD SHACK (CEMETERY) - NIGHT

STEVE sits at his desk, feet up, drinking coffee and
reading a book between sips.

A small television keeps him company from a chair in the
corner of the room. Through the --

WINDOW

-- headlights approach, and light up the driveway and
gate.

INT. GUARD SHACK (CEMETERY) - NIGHT

As Steve glances at the ever-worsening picture on the
television, the same headlights light up his work

station.

Annoyed, he switches off the television and walks to the
window.

The sound of TRUCK DOORS OPENING, and the CRUNCH OF
FOOTSTEPS on gravel.

Steve squints from the bright headlights, trying to make
out who it is.

He shades his eyes, and peers closer.

The distinctive, but muted, sound of a METAL GATE being
SHAKEN.

Steve grabs his flashlight and steps outside.

EXT. GUARD SHACK (CEMETERY) - NIGHT

A large removal truck is parked and two young men: BEN
and TREVOR (20s) hover beside the gate.

STEVE
Cemetery closed at six.

BEN
Yeah, we know.

Ben reaches over, pulls at the lock, and grins.
BEN
Can we come in?

STEVE
No.

PETE
Open the gate.

Ben slowly coils his fingers around the bars.

PETE
Come on Steve. Open the gate.

STEVE
How do you know my name?

BEN
Steve, we don't have much time.
Come closer.

He glares at Steve. Steve takes a step forward.

BEN
Let us in, okay?

Steve unlocks and opens the gate.

PETE
That's a good man.

Pete grabs Steve by the arm.
PETE
I have someone that would like to
meet you.
They lead Steve to the rear of the truck, push him
inside, and SLAM the door shut.

INT. BACK OF TRUCK - NIGHT

In the darkness, six shadowy figures slowly close in on
Steve. As he backs himself up against the wall, a lone
figure moves in.

Steve’s SCREAMS are drowned out as the truck RUMBLES to
life.
EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT

Deep within the dark cemetery, the truck stops beside a
lone grave site.
3.

The rear doors open, five MEN get out with pick-axes and

shovels, and begin to dig.
A shovel swoops down and --

WIPES INTO A--

EXT. BRISBANE - MORNING

A sprawling mass of steel and glass.

INT. MARK'S APARTMENT (BEDROOM) - MORNING

A young woman, JAMI (22), puts on her clothes.

MARK (25), stirs next to her, half asleep.

MARK
You know, unless it's a one night
stand, leaving before the other
half wakes up could be considered
rude.

JAMI
It’s Monday.

MARK
Already? Sorry hun. Do you want me
to come with you? I kind of get
the feeling you don't want me to
meet your Mother.

She playfully punches him in the arm.

Frenzied CLAWING SOUNDS come from somewhere near the

front door.

Mark zips out into the --

SMALL HALLWAY

CALVIN, a totally freaked-out little Boxer, desperately

tries to scratch his way out.

MARK
Calvin! Stop that!

Mark swats his rump.

Calvin continues clawing.
MARK
CALVIN!

As Mark reaches down to pull him away from the door,
Calvin stops scratching, and GROWLS very softly.

MARK
Cal?

Calvin frantically claws at the door again. Mark quickly
unbolts the door, and Calvin runs off.

Jami appears behind Mark.

JAMI
What was that all about?

MARK
I don't know. He's never done that
before.

JAMI

Must have a hot date!
Jami looks at her watch.

JAMI
Okay, you have five minutes to get
dressed if you want to come with

me.
MARK
Really?
JAMI
Yes... But hurry, before I change
my mind.
MARK
Do I need to wear anything
special?
JAMI

Mark, she's been dead for a year
now. She won't mind what you wear.

EXT. CEMETERY - MORNING

Mark sits next to Jami in her van, as she slowly drives
through the cemetery. He yawns, still not fully awake
yet.
INT. JAMI'S VAN (MOVING) - NIGHT

JAMI
I wonder where Steve is.

MARK
Maybe he's asleep.
JAMI
Probably. Let's not keep Mum

waiting.

As they drive through the cemetery, the scenery becomes
dominated by huge trees and bright green grass.

They both turn and check out the gravestones they pass.
Jami casually turns back to face the windshield.

JAMI
Shit!

Jami slams on the breaks, and the van skids to a halt.

MARK
What is that?

On the --

ROAD
-- in front of them lies a skeleton in a long dress.

Clumps of brownish hair cling to a shattered skull, and
both legs and one arm are broken off.

On both sides of the road scattered across the neatly
trimmed grass are strewn fragments of skulls, arms, legs,
spines and hips.

CEMETERY

Many headstones turned over, graves dug up and mounds of
earth everywhere.

INT. JAMI’S VAN - NIGHT

Mark recoils in horror.

MARK
Jesus!

Jami jumps out of the van --
EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT
-- and takes of running through the cemetery.

MARK (V.O.)
Jami, wait.

Mark jumps out of the van and chases after her.

JAMI
Mum.

Jami's run slows to a staggered walk as she takes in what
she is sees.

JAMI
Mum?

A handful of graves have been dug up, and headstones
tossed aside like cardboard props.

On the ground in front of her lies a corpse, that of an
old woman.

She lies broken on the ground, with her an elegant dress
darkened by rotting flesh.

The corpse itself lies mouth agape with one eye open.
The flesh has been stripped from one arm.

JAMI
Mum?

MARK
Don't look!

Jami backs away, soundless, deep within the throes of a
silent cry/scream.

Mark quickly grabs hold of her as her legs go weak.

Her eyes roll backwards, and she faints in shock.

INT. BROOKMAN HOUSE (BEDROOM) - DAY

ERIK (58), a police officer, stands at his bedroom
window, soaking in the bright sunlight.

He slowly buttons his shirt, getting ready for the day,
but seems distant, lost in thought.

He runs his hand along the window ledge, checking for
dust.
7.

The ledge is caked and the windows have been nailed shut
with massive nails.

Erik stops what he’s doing and sniffs the air.

He quickly rushes out of the bedroom, and downstairs into
the --

KITCHEN

-- where he scrapes burnt eggs into the trash bin, on
top of a pile of other burnt stuff.

Erik realizes the time, and looks at his watch.

ERIK
Oh shit.

He grabs his brief case, kisses his finger, and --

ERIK
(to photo)
I'll see you when I get home.

-- gently touches a picture of his beautiful wife. She
appears carefree and youthful.

As Erik backs down the drive, two MONGREL DOGS run across
the street.

INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

The usual frantic sounds of a busy police station as Erik
plows through the crowd, coffee protectively in hand.

He comes to rest at his desk. His partner, REECE TRAVIS
(40), is on the phone.

REECE
I've no idea. This reporter
stopped a passing cruiser.
Apparently the place is a mess,
bodies everywhere. No, actually
that’s the weird part, no
coffins...

Flicking through his paperwork for the day, Erik spits
coffee all over the place when he hears this.

ERIK
Who was in the cruiser?

Reece looks up.
REECE
Um, hang on a second. Richards, I
think.

Erik jumps on the phone.

INT. THE COURIER

Four large desks spread across the room in various stages
of disarray.

Several people rush around as Jami enters the main doors.
With a fake half-smile, she barges straight into the --

EDITOR'S OFFICE

-- where she takes a deep, cleansing breath to steel up
her nerves.

WALTER STYLES, blue goatee, red ponytail and Joe 90
spec's.

WALTER
Jami. Heard about your mother.
It’s a pretty fucked situation I
know but look, I find coffee fixes
everything.

He hits the intercom, Sally answers.

SALLY (V.O.)
Yes Wally?

WALTER
Would you be a dear and bring in
two coffees?

Walter turns off the intercom, cutting Sally off in mid-
gripe.

A fresh copy of the Courier lays open on the desk in
front of him.

He pops a couple of vitamin pills, and pushes the paper
across to Jami.

WALTER
She’s gonna kill me with all of
this keep-fit-shit! Free word of
advice: Never sleep with your
secretary. Hey, you seen the front
page yet? It's a grabber!
Jami spins the paper so it faces her.

INSERT - NEWSPAPER

It has skeletons on the page, plus the headline, "WHO IS
THE BODY SNATCHER?" Beneath that, in smaller print: "Jami
Yearwood's shocking reveal this weekend"

BACK TO SCENE

Jami looks shocked.

JAMI
The Body snatcher? Walter, what
the hell--

WALTER

People who pick up a mag or tab
look for someone to blame for all
the crap in their lives. A bad
guy: Bin Laden, Jack the Ripper...

JAMI
Do you think this, body snatcher’
will strike again?

WALTER

He already has! I got interested
in this before last night, I gave
Google a work out. Over the last
two months the same thing happened
at the Dutton Park and Bald Hills
cemeteries. Missing bodies... yada-
yada.

Jami skims Walter’s piece as she sips coffee.

JAMI
Christ. What's going on with this
city?

WALTER

That’s what you are going to tell
me. Now it’s gotten all fucked up
and personal for you, I want you
to go all out and find this
bastard 'Body Snatcher'.

JAMI
Walt, you know this isn't just one
guy. No one can rip a cemetery up
like that overnight by themselves--
10.

WALTER
Maybe he's really strong, like a
superhero. Maybe he drives around
in a Bobcat? Who the fuck knows!
Anyway, by narrowing it down to
just the one weirdo will sell us
more papers. Evil, babe... pure
fucking evil!

JAMI
Superhero's? You wish. Hey, do I
get expenses?

WALTER
Yes full, whatever you need! This
guy is going to be a total cash

cow.
JAMI
I--
WALTER
The. Body. Snatcher. Now fuck the
fuck off.

Jami turns and storms out of the office.

EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT

Erik sits in his car in front of the locked gates of the
Cemetery. He checks his watch.

His car is littered with old scrap books with newspaper
clippings.

INSERT - NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS

Headlines: "Child Missing" - "Family Missing" - "Town's
Folk Disappear" - "Vampires... Trick or Treat?" - "Murders
Plague Town"... The dates range from 40 years ago.

BACK TO SCENE
A torch shines in Erik’s face.

GREG
Can I help you?

Erik shows his badge.
GREG
Oh. Sorry.

The torch beam lowers.

GREG
What can I do for you?

ERIK
I was here earlier investigating
the vandalism incident.

GREG
The boss mentioned it when he
called me in. I don't usually
work Monday nights. My wife
pitched a fit.

ERIK
I bet she did.

GREG
I heard the same thing happened at
Dutton Park a few weeks ago...
Crazy world.

ERIK
Crazy.

GREG
Do you want to take a look around?
I've got an extra flashlight...

ERIK
No need for that.

Erik scans the area.

ERIK
Is there a lock on the door of
your little house there?

GREG
Yeah, why?

ERIK
If anyone comes to the gate
tonight, man woman or child
doesn't matter who, don't open
your door. And if they attempt to
open the gate themselves, please
don't try to stop them.

Greg takes a step away from Erik’s car.

11.
12.

GREG
What is this, a joke?

ERIK
It's for your own safety sir,
these people are dangerous.

GREG
What's your name?

ERIK
Whoever comes tonight don't listen
to anything they say--

GREG
Officer, I think you should go.

He starts walking to the guard shack.

GREG
I'm calling your station!

ERIK
Please sir. Remember what I've
said.

Greg's flashlight shakes slightly as he speaks.

GREG
Yeah, yeah...

Greg disappears into his guard shack, and slams the door.

ERIK
Please, please... Let me be wrong.

Erik looks over, concerned. Starts his car and slowly
drives off.
EXT. STREET - DAY

A YOUNG COUPLE wander down a grubby street, the female is
pregnant, they both look underfed, and aged beyond their
years.

A man, CUTTER, smiles at them and signals toward a nearby
alley, the couple quickly enter it.

Cutter slowly gets to his feet and swaggers off down the
ally.
13.

A LARGE MAN observes from the shadows across the street,
when he sees them walk down the ally he slowly makes his
way across the street towards them.

The man runs off with the woman following close behind.
They almost run into the dark figure. They look shocked,
then ashamed as they quickly scurry away.

CUTTER
Thank you, come again.

He laughs to himself, and gathers his stuff, about to
leave.

The dark figure steps into the mouth of the ally. Cutter
looks up, surprised.

He covers his eyes as the shadowed figure slowly strides
toward him. FATHER ABEL STONESTREET (60).

CUTTER
This ain't your ally friend, best
you turn around before I make you.

ABEL
How long have you been dealing
heroin to Peter and his wife,
Cutter?

CUTTER
Shit! Looks like I lost the bet.

ABEL
Bet?

CUTTER
The boys and I had a bet going, to
see how long it would take you to
stick your nose in. Want a piece
of the action. Let's face it
Stony, you couldn't protect your
own family. Like you can't protect
these losers--

ABEL
I'm going to give you one chance,
if I find you dealing in my area
to my people again I will-

CUTTER
You will what? You play by a new
set of rules now. Do unto others
or some such shit...
14.

Abel grabs Cutters shoulders and smashes him with a head
butt, splitting the dealer's nose, and covering his face
with blood.

Cutter topples like a tree, and cracks the back of his
head hard on the pavement.

ABEL
It's more of a guideline...

Abel kneels next to him, and wipes Cutter's fresh blood
off his own forehead.

ABEL
If I ever see your scum-bag-ass
around here again, friend, I will
kill you.

LEON
Hey! Father Stonestreet!

A small boy in blue jeans, LEON (12), runs excitedly up
to Abel, holding on to a large pizza box.

ABEL
Hey, Leon. What are you doing out
of school?

Abel stands, dabbing at Cutters blood still on his
forehead.

LEON
I have to take care of June. Dad
didn't come home last night.

ABEL
Where did he go?

LEON
Out. He was playing cards for a
little while with Aunt Mary... But
that was last night.

ABEL
Did you go around to his work
today?

Leon nods his head, glum. Abel ruffles his hair

ABEL
Are you and June okay?

LEON
Yes Father.
15.

ABEL
Your Dad left some money for you?

LEON
There’s some in the top drawer. I
got pizza! Is that man okay?

Abel looks down at Cutter. He seems to be coming to.

ABEL
Yes, he just had a fall. I'm
taking care of him. You'd better
get back home and give June her
pizza before it goes cold. Hurry
now, I’1l pop by later this
evening... before it gets dark.

Leon skips off.
Abel drags the semi-conscious man to his feet.

ABEL
I don't want to see anyone dealing
around here ever again. Got it?

CUTTER
Yes.

Cutter trembles like a leaf as he coughs up some blood.

ABEL
The only reason you're alive
Cutter is so you can warn the
others, do you understand?

Cutter spits at Abel as he gets into his car.
CUTTER
Watch your back.
INT. CHURCH - DAY

Abel sits in the rear of the church, inside his sparse,
student-style living quarters. The only bit of colour
comes from the crayon drawings on blank white walls.

Seemingly content, Abel drinks some water from the small
sink.

The CREAK of an opening, then closing door emits from the
church. Abel goes out to investigate. At the --
16.
ALTAR

-- an eighteen year old man, JAKE, stares at the stained
glass window.

ABEL
Jake? Jacob Harvey? Good God, how
you've grown! Please sit down. Its
been too long.

JAKE
I'd almost forgotten what it
looked like.

Abel nods, and eyes the young man with intrigue.

ABEL
You came to see me for a reason?

JAKE
Maybe.

Both men share a silent moment as Jake tries to
formulate.

JAKE
Has Kelly dropped by?

ABEL
Elliot? No... Why?

JAKE
She's pregnant, and now she's
gone. Even her crazy mother
doesn't know where she is.

Abel nods his head, listening.

JAKE
I went by the cops this morning
and talked to the missing person's
guy. He said she had to be gone
for longer...

ABEL
Being pregnant, she's probably
afraid to face her mother--

JAKE
Who wouldn't be! She's completely
nuts and will totally kill me when
she finds out.
17.

ABEL
We'll pop by and see her together.
Maybe Mrs. Elliot will refrain
from bloody murder if I'm by your
side. But... Don't count on it...

EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

On the front steps a thin brown mongrel dog sleeps.

Several windows are open, but the building seems
unnaturally silent.

Halfway up the steps, Jake turns to Abel.

ABEL
What is it?

JAKE
Something's wrong.

ABEL
Come on.

Abel takes another step and the dog's head instantly
raises. Its eyes burn.

JAKE
Father.

The dog stands and bares its teeth with a low, vibrating
growl.

ABEL
Who's dog is this?

Jake shrugs. Abel moves forward again, and the dog
crouches, like he's about to leap.

ABEL
He’s not going to let us inside.
Come on, lets try another way.

They run out the door to an --

ALLEYWAY

-- and find a door that leads to the basement. Jake kicks
the door in.

Abel gives him an intense stare. He shrugs. They descend
the basement steps, and wind up in the basement.
18.

INT. BASEMENT - DAY

Abel and Jake try to focus in the murky light.
Although, they can see vague shapes: Mounds of papers,
old televisions, a few old chairs and what looks like

rolled up carpets and shower curtains.

They cross the room, and climb some wooden stairs.

INT. ENTRANCE HALL - DAY

They come out of a doorway, and spot the sleeping dog on
the steps.

The front door is behind the dog.

They quietly climb the main --

TENEMENT STAIRS
-- talking in low voices as they go.

JAKE
It's quiet in here.

ABEL

I was thinking the same thing.
INT. FOURTH FLOOR - DAY
Abel and Jake quietly step into the fourth floor hallway.
The light is dim, and they can barely make out some of
the opened apartment doors - many have deep scratches on
them.
INT. TENEMENT STAIRS - DAY

As they move up another floor to the fifth level, Abel
stops to look at some new graffiti.

INSERT - GRAFFITI

"ALL FOR THE MASTER"

INT. TENEMENT STAIRS - DAY

Abel touches the big brown letters, rubbing between his
thumb and fore finger he quickly sniffs it.
19.

ABEL
This is blood.

They go another couple of steps, and exit onto the fifth
floor landing.
INT. FIFTH FLOOR (HALLWAY) - DAY

They walk down the hall, and peer into one of the open --

APARTMENT
-- doors. It’s a total wreck!

Bits of shattered mirror on the floor; on the wall above
the bed, written in blood:

INSERT - GRAFFITI

"ALL FOR THE MASTER"

APARTMENT

Newspapers stuck all over the bedroom window reduce the
light to a pale haze.

Jake and Abel enter. Jake rips the newspapers off. He
opens a window for some much needed fresh air.

Something moves in the room. Jake and Abel share a
puzzled look. The sound of cloth as it rubs against cloth
rises again.

Jake stares at the bare mattress. The noise rises once
again and he quickly figures out where it's coming from.

JAKE
Father.

Jake moves to the bed.

JAKE
Help me move this.

They push the bed aside and under it is an oddly shaped
cocoon of bed sheets wrapped tightly around what might be
a two headed man.

ABEL
I think we better call the police.
20.

Jake continues to tear even more frantically at the
sheet.

Gray hair and a pale forehead, plus a second scalp. This
one, however, with dark hair.

Jake tears the sheet free from their faces. It's a man
and his son. Their faces are white - drained.

Abel reaches down and feels for heartbeats.

JAKE
They're dead, aren't they? Why do
they look like that?

ABEL
I don't know.

Jake stands. As he does, a shard of white sunlight falls
across the mans face.

ABEL
What's happened here?

Behind them something rustles. They turn to see the man
moves his legs within the sheet.

His feet push against the floor, his arms tightly locked
around his son. His grey lipped mouth twitches, as if he
were about to scream.

JAKE
He's not dead!

ABEL
Jake, get out! Now!

Abel watches the man open his mouth and make a hideous,
anguished moan that sounds like a low wind blowing
through trees.

His legs push frantic now and manages in a brief moment
to squirm back under the bed.

They twitch a few times then lay still.

Abel crosses the room to the closet and opens it. At the
bottom is a pile of old newspapers and clothes.

Abel stares for a few moments, and then prods it with his
foot.

Something moves. He shifts uneasily, and slams the door
shut.

Hurries out to where Jake waits.
21.

ABEL
All right, now we get the police.
EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

People cluster around the outside of the apartment
building, police barriers already in place.

Erik and Reece pass two paramedics with a stretcher. On
top, is a woman with a white sheet up to her chin, which
matches the colour of her skin.

Her body writhes in agony as the sun hits her face. It
contorts hideously, but no sound emits from her mouth.

The woman is quickly loaded into one of the waiting
ambulances.

REECE
Aren't these supposed to be
corpses? God, what's wrong with
that woman?
INT. BUILDING ENTRANCE - DAY

Erik flashes his badge at a nearby officer.

ERIK
Where's Teal?

OFFICER
Third floor, captain.

A small form in the corner of the entrance hall catches
his eye.

It's a dead dog, with a bullet hole in its head.

INT. APARTMENT BUILDING (THIRD FLOOR) - DAY

They enter an apartment where Teal is speaking with Abel
and Jake.

ERIK
I'm Captain Brookman. What do you

have?

Teal motions them away from the civilians.
22.

As Erik does so, his shoes crunch on glass. He looks
down, and realizes he stepped on shards of a broken
mirror.

TEAL
Father Abel Stonestreet and Jake
Harvey found the first bodies. So
far we've pulled thirty nine of
them out of closets and from under
beds. They were rolled up in
shower curtains, rugs and sheets.

Teal double-checks to see if anyone is listening.

TEAL
Problem is, and this sounds crazy
I know but...

ERIK
Go on.

TEAL
The Medics have confirmed there
are no vitals... but the hell of

it is they just keep on moving!
Some kind of a freakish muscle
reflex? Trick of rigor mortis?

Erik closes his eyes briefly, his hand rises up to his
forehead.

ERIK
Any type of wound, trauma on their
bodies?

TEAL

I checked a couple on my arrival,
saw some cuts, bruises. That's
about it.

ERIK
No. That's not all.

Another stretcher goes by. It’s occupant has the same
pale face as the first one.

TEAL
Sir?

ERIK
Nothing. I'm thinking out loud.
Where are the bodies being taken?
23.

TEAL
Royal Brisbane. It's the nearest
with the facilities to handle this
many stiffs. Probably going to
have to get the SES, bring a cold
truck in anyway. What do you think
Captain? Disease? Poison? Or
something really out there, cult-
like?

ERIK
Not sure. Just keep it to
yourself. We don't want to start a
panic. Has the coroner arrived

yet?

TEAL
Yes sir, upstairs... shall I go
get her?

ERIK

Sure, I'd like a minute or two
with your witnesses first.

Teal nods and leaves the apartment, closes the door
behind him.

Erik surveys the room, then the two men on the other
side.

ERIK
Gentlemen, I'm Captain Brookman.
I have a few questions--

ABEL
We've already given our
statements.

ERIK

I know, and I'm sorry to have to
ask you to go over it again.

Erik walks past them, taking a quick look into the
bedroom.

ERIK
What do you think happened here,
Father?

ABEL

I have no idea. Jake and I came
looking for Mrs. Elliot, who
lives... lived on the fifth floor.
We found the building just as it
is now.
24.

JAKE
I want to get out of here. I cant
stand this place.

ERIK
A little longer okay? You saw the
bodies. Are they dead or alive?

JAKE
Dead.

ERIK
Sergeant Teal tells me thirty nine
bodies have been found. How many
people lived in this building?

ABEL
I'd say a good fifty... sixty.

Abel shakes his head.

ERIK
Not all the apartments were
occupied?

ERIK
Thank you.

ABEL

What do you think happened to
these people, officer?

Erik leaves the room without saying a word.

In the --

HALLWAY

-- outside, Erik leans heavily against a wall, racks his
brain. Teal and a female, DR. LADDY (45), approach.

TEAL
Captain? This is Dr. Laddy.

They shake hands as another stretcher goes past. Erik
catches a glimpse of the bodies again but looks away

quickly.

DR. LADDY
Captain, I've never seen or heard
of anything like this there's no
pooling of blood, no rigor

mortis...
(MORE)
25.
DR. LADDY (CONT'D)
But, somehow the bodies are
completely cool. I pricked the
finger of one of them, and do you
know what came out? Nothing.

Erik listens. His worst fears realized.

DR. LADDY
They've been totally exsanguinated
but there's no sign of
haemorrhaging. I have called a
colleague in from the North Side,
to see if he can make any sense of
it. A second perspective might
help.

ERIK
Nothing can help. Its too late.
We've got to leave all of them
here and burn this whole building
to the ground with them inside,
right now.

Abel and Jake stand in the doorway and watch Erik start
to lose it. Even a uniformed officer halfway down the
corridor notices.

ERIK
What are you all looking at?
You've seen the bodies! They're
reacting to sunlight! They can
sweep through a whole building in
less than one night! How long do
you think it will take them to do
this to whole streets? We have to
burn this building to the ground
and kill them, because when
these... these bodies wake up
they're going to be thirsty! You
can't take them to the Hospital!
You can't let them get out into
the streets!

A hand grips his shoulder and spins him around.
REECE
Captain, come with me. Lets go get

some coffee, okay?

He jerks free and pushes Reece back. He turns to Abel.
26.

ERIK
You! You of all people should
recognise the evil that's creeping
up on this city! God in heaven,
cant you feel it in there? Tell
them not to let these things wake
up!

Abel is unsure at what he should say.

ERIK
Father, please don't let the
vampire loose on the streets! Tell
them we have to burn the bodies!

Reece tries to guide Erik toward the stairs.
ERIK
Don't take them to the hospital.

Burn them. Burn them all.

REECE
Come on Erik, take it easy.

Abel stares at them as they head off down the stairs.

INT. HOSPITAL MORGUE - NIGHT

A frustrated doctor consults chart after chart, and
shakes his weary head. He starts to prep yet another body
for an autopsy.

In the background table after table of bodies covered in
sheets.

He concentrates, about to make the first incision.
A noise startles him.

In the background every sheet covered body sits up.

EXT. MARK' APARTMENT - NIGHT

Jami Yearwood walks through the --

FRONT DOOR
-- which is open slightly.

JAMI
Mark? You home?
27.

Silence - she steps into the dark room, feels along the
wall until she finds the light-switch and turns it on.

The living room is a complete and utter wreck.

JAMI
Mark?

Jami quickly moves down the --

HALLWAY

-- to his bedroom. The door is closed. She opens the
door, steps into the --

BEDROOM

-- and reaches around for the light-switch, but can’t
find it. On the other side of the half opened door,
Mark's dog snarls at her.

Jami jumps back. The dog is hunched low to the floor,
ready to leap.

JAMI
Calvin? It's me boy, it's Jami.
Where's Mark?

The dog tilts its head as if he hears something, and
leaps right past her, and down the hallway.

Jami hears a muffled noise on the other side of the room.
She reaches for the light switch, and finds it this time.
The bed sheets are missing, but everything else seems
okay.

Something grips her around her ankle.

Startled she looks down and sees a claw-like hand.

Jami screams, and kicks like crazy, until she gets her
ankle free.

The noise starts up again.

She staggers against the bedroom wall as a shape wrapped
in bed sheets writhes its way out.

As it works itself free, she can see that's it's --

JAMI
Mark!
28.

The sheet slips off. Mark stands with his eyes blazing.
He licks his lips with a black tongue.

MARK
Jami...

As Mark steps toward her, a quick tongue flick across his
thirsty lips.

Jami turns and runs for the door.

Mark’s hand grabs her blouse, but the sleeve just tears.

EXT. MARK'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Jami makes it out into the courtyard.

Over by Jami's car, other figures lurk amongst shadows.
Faces grin lit up by the spotlights outside.

Jami dares not look back.

Mark launches himself at her.

She hits the ground with a loud smack. Mark, on top of
her now, grips her by the hair and forces her head back.

JAMI
No Mark! Please!

MARK
Ssshhhhhh... It's okay.

Suddenly, Mark is lifted up and thrown off of her, only
to be replaced by a very large man whose face is more
terrifying then Mark's.

He leans over Jami. His fangs bare, and move closer to
her throat.

Mark grips the man by his throat, and hauls him off.

Jami gets to her feet as the two vampires fight and snap
at each other like rabid animals.

Jami turns and runs for her life. She turns her head
toward a rustling sound in the bushes. It’s a WOMAN in a
glittery dress.

Jami dives into her car, and quickly rolls the windows
up.
29.

INT/EXT. CAR (MOVING) - DAY

As Jamie drives off, the woman claws at the windshield
and hammers it with her fists.

Jami accelerates, and the woman rolls over the roof, off
the back, and lands on her feet.

EXT. CAR (MOVING) - DAY

The woman chases after Jami, although she soon gives up.

Jami speeds through several blocks before she pulls over.
Horns blow as cars swerve to miss her.

Jami is an emotional wreck. Suddenly a soft tap on the
window. A face stares down at her.

JAMI
What the fuc--

POLICEMAN
License please, Miss.
INT. BROOKMAN HOUSE - LOUNGE - NIGHT
Erik picking at his dinner, his hands shaking slightly.
He looks at a picture of his wife, takes another small
bite, then looks away again.
INT. DAN'S APARTMENT (BEDROOM) - NIGHT

KYEEMA OLIVER (33), reads in bed. Her husband, DAN,
sleeps next to her. She puts her book down in mid-yawn.

Suddenly, the smash of glass, and a loud, piercing
scream.

She leaps out of bed, and goes straight to the window.
Tries to see what's going on.

There is another scream, but this time its cut short mid-
scream.

She runs back to Dan and shakes him.

DAN
Jesus... What is it?
30.

KYEEMA
Something serious is happening
next door, I heard screams.

Dan sits up in bed.
DAN
Probably just shagging. Remember

last week--

KYEEMA
I know what fucking shagging
sounds like. But I don't think
Reece and Tilly are playing kinky
cops tonight...

A SHRILL stops Kyeema in her tracks.

She rushes back to the --

WINDOW

-- and sees two shapes in the back yard, a MAN attacking
a SMALL GIRL.

KYEEMA (0.S.)
Dan, Dan! Someone's in our back
yard and he's hurting Megan!

EXT. DAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

We can't make out the facial features of the man, who is
all over the little girl.

The floodlights come on, and the back door flies open.
Dan rushes up with a baseball bat in his hands.

DAN
Get off her.

No response.

Kyeema looks down from the upstairs window, and
frantically bangs on it to get Dan’s attention.

DAN
I'll crack your skull in if you
don't get the fuck off her now!

As Dan gets closer, the scene looks very wrong.
31.

It’s not the man who is attacking the girl. It’s the girl
who is attacking, and draining blood, from him.

She somehow manages to hold him up.
Dan realizes it’s her father - Reece!

DAN
Reece? Megan? What in gods name...

Megan drops her father; he falls like the dead weight he
is.

She turns and moves toward Dan at lightning speed. Before
he can react, she brings him down hard on his back.

She squats on his chest, grabs the bat and throws it
toward the house.

Megan hisses, and leans in for the kill.

DAN
Megan, no, no!

A scream tears through the night as Kyeema sprints out of
the house like Usain Bolt.

Within seconds, she has the bat, and takes an almighty
swing at Megan.

She connects beautifully with Megan's little head.
CRACK!
The same sound of a home run shot in the World Series.

Megan FLIES backwards off Dan, and hits the ground very
hard.

Kyeema helps Dan to his feet and they scramble to the
safety of the --
INTERCUT: COURTYARD / APARTMENT

Dan and Kyeema watch from inside as she clicks her
dislocated neck back into place.

Dan creeps over to the door. Kyeema grabs a hold of him,
and pulls him to the floor.

Megan is right at the back door.
She taps on the window, and slowly scratches on the door.

Kyeema looks up.
32.

KYEEMA
Go away Megan. Please go away!

DAN
Go home, Megan! Now.

There are a few beats of silence.

Kyeema shakes with fear. Dan in shock. Both of them are
too scared to even breathe.

They wait for another sound from Megan.

INT. LAIR - NIGHT
We slowly drift through a room softly lit by candles.

A thin shape sits in the semi darkness. ROLLAND
MARMERCHANT. His frame is obscured by a robe and a hood.

Red eyes glow beneath the hood.

As a tall, bald, muscular man, STITCH, stands in the
doorway. He bows and enters.

ROLLAND
Mr. Stitch.

STITCH
We grow stronger every night.

ROLLAND
Soon my name will be written in
the history of a new world. Our
world.

STITCH
Things are changing rapidly
master. Our existence will not
remain secret for too much longer.

ROLLAND
We no longer have anything to
fear. It's time to step from out
of shadows. Show these humans who
the true dominant species on earth
really are...

A grin spreads over Stitches face.
33.

ROLLAND
We shall carve our legend into the
annals of the new race. In my
name.

STITCH
In your name.

Rolland's smile quickly fades.

ROLLAND
Do you have any more news from the
borders to the south?

STITCH
Nothing yet, but I don't predict
any threat. House Rancall are
governed by fools.

ROLLAND
Agreed but I hear rumours; a power
shift. We can’t afford to
underestimate any thing, not now.

STITCH
I'll double the border patrols.

ROLLAND
Very well, I shall leave it in
your capable hands.

INT. JAMI'S APARTMENT (BEDROOM) - DAY

Jami tosses uneasily in the bed of her small, studio
apartment.

A packet of sleeping pills and bottle of vodka on the
bedside table tell her story.

She murmurs Mark's name, then lets out a faint whimper.

INT. ABEL'S ROOM - DAY

Abel splashes water onto his face, and goes to the single
window of his room. He opens it, and inhales a lung full
of air.

His eyes widen as he spots the alley wall across the way.

INSERT - ALLEY WALL

In blood red writing, the words, “FOLLOW THE MASTER.”
34.
BACK TO SCENE
Abel stares hard at the message for a few seconds.

Thoroughly shaken, he turns from the window, and gets
dressed.

INT. ERIK'S HOUSE - DAY
Erik pulls a can of black spray paint out of a paper bag.

He shakes it and sprays on the front side of his open
front door, a large black crucifix above the word:

“BEWARE — VAMPIRE KILLER!”

INT. JAKE'S APARTMENT (HALLWAY) - NIGHT

A young woman, KELLY (24), stands outside Jake's
apartment door. She knocks.

Movement inside, but no one answers. She knocks even
harder.

KELLY
Jake! Open the door! Its me!

JAKE
Kelly?

Jake steps to the door, unlocks and throws it open.

Instantly she leaps forward into his arms and buries her
face into his shoulder.

JAKE
Kelly! I've been going crazy
looking for you!

KELLY
Don't say anything, please. Just
hold me. Tight. Tighter.

JAKE
You're freezing. Where have you
been? God, I'm so glad to see you.

KELLY
Don't talk. Just make me warm.

She lifts her head back, her eyes an unnatural yellow.
35.

KELLY
Make me warm.

Her mouth opens and her fangs slide out.

JAKE
No!

He pushes her away and takes step backward. He trips and
cracks his head on the edge of a table.

KELLY
Jake. I've come back for you. I've
come back.

JAKE
Get away!

KELLY

We can be together forever.

JAKE
No!

KELLY
Yes, forever and ever.

Jake screams and thrusts his arms out trying to sustain
his life for a few brief moments more.

Kelly catches his right arm, grins and sinks her teeth
into a vein on his wrist.

When she is finished she lets his arm drop to the floor.

KELLY
Now we'll be together for always.
We'll always be young... And we'll
always be in love. Sleep my
precious, sleep.

She gathers the sheets off the unmade bed and wraps him
up.

She then drags Jake into the closet, piles a few papers
and card board boxes around him and closes the door.
INT. LAIR (ROOM) - NIGHT

Stitch stands in front of a large Fireplace.

His features can hardly be recognized from the blaze of
the fire. Rolland enters.
36.

ROLLAND
My favourite pupil. My army grows.
Yes?

STITCH

Close to one hundred and fifty
thousand, master.

ROLLAND
We need more. And quick, we only
have once chance before we lose
the element of surprise.

STITCH
Master, we double in strength
every night--

ROLLAND
I want an orgy of hunger! A
celebration of power unlike any
this or any planet in the history
of time has ever seen. Let them
run amok and take as many as they
can.

Rolland shuts his eyes. When he opens them again, they’re
as bright as blast furnaces.

INT. JAMI'S APARTMENT - DAY

A gentle knock-knock on her front door.

The blinds are drawn and the door has a solid chair
propped up against it.

Half empty cups of coffee and bottles of alcohol are
spread everywhere.

Jami, wrapped in blankets on the couch, and watches white
noise on the TELEVISION.

Someone knocks on the front door. She ignores it and
turns down the hiss on her screen.

The knocks stop briefly, then starts up again.

JAMI
Damn it!

She jumps up and shouts through her closed door.

JAMI
Who is it?
37.

ERIK (0.S.)
Erik. Captain Brookman from--

JAMI
What do you want?

A torn piece of paper slides under the door.

ERIK (0.S.)
Your help. Please, come round to
my home later. I really need to
speak to you.

EXT. ERIK'S HOUSE - DAY

Erik closes the door behind Jami, and locks it.

ERIK
Thank you. Please take a seat. Can
I get you--

JAMI

Coffee, please.
Erik goes into the kitchen. Jami scans the room.
She raises an eyebrow at the clearly nailed shut windows.

JAMI
What's with the windows?

ERIK
I'll explain when the priest gets
here.

JAMI
A priest? What is this, a shotgun
wedding?

A knock at the door.

Erik re-enters the room, smirks at her humour ,and opens
the front door to father Abel Stonestreet.

ERIK
Come in, Father. Thank you for
coming.

Jami stares at him as he enters.

ERIK
Father Stonestreet, this is
reporter Jami Yearwood.
38.

He shakes Jami's hand. She glances at the nailed shut

windows.

ABEL
Please, call me Abel. Now Captain,
I'd like to know why you called
me. There must be a dozen Catholic
churches within a twenty kilometre
radius of here.

ERIK
I called because I thought you
would understand the gravity of
the situation. You were there. You
saw the bodies.

ABEL
The vampires? There are many evils
in the world. Drug dealers, child
beaters, homicidal maniacs,
rapists. I think we both have more
than enough work Captain without
inventing any more.

ERIK
Open your mind, Father.

JAMI
I’ve seen them too. He isn't
crazy.

ABEL
Miss?

JAMI

I have seen them. The officer is
right. They do exist.

ERIK
Please Father, sit.

ABEL
How can you be so sure?

ERIK
The signs are everywhere, this
isn't the first time this has
happened, just not on this scale.

ABEL
Why haven't we seen anything in
the news?
39.

ERIK
Because they are careful. This has
been going on for decades;
centuries, even. If a small
country town disappears, who will
notice, let alone care?

ABEL
Brisbane isn't a country town.

ERIK
Which means that something big is
happening.

JAMI

How come you know all of this
other stuff?

Erik drops a huge scrap book on the table in front of
them.

ERIK
This was my mothers. For the
longest time I thought my mother
was crazy. She shot my father in
the face the night we moved to the
city.

ABEL
Good lord.

ERIK
When I got older I had her put in
a home, she was always rambling
about the shadows outside at
night, and things coming to get
her. She had even nailed the
windows shut.

Abel and Jami swap glances.

ERIK
After she died I found this
scrapbook, and six others like it,
filled with news clippings about
missing people, small townships
where every resident just upped
and apparently left... Plain
disappeared.
40.

JAMI
Can't we tell someone? My paper
eats this type of stuff for
breakfast, it would be a nice
change for it to actually be real.

ERIK
We don't have time.

ABEL
So how do you kill a vampire?

ERIK
Stakes to the heart, sunlight and
decapitation seem to be the only
things that kill them.

ABEL
You've killed a vampire then?

ERIK
Yes... My wife.

Jamie and Abel exchange looks.

They are trapped in a house with a murderer who is
clearly agitated, obsessive, and possibly psychotic.

ERIK
Father, Jami, we all know that
evil remains constant, if they do
exist and they feel strong enough
to take us on. They could attack
in the hope it will be too late
for us to fight back.

JAMI
Jesus.

Erik tosses a small local map on the table along with a
few photo's.

ERIK
There are a network of caves under
these factories in and around this
area. I've done some scouting. I
believe they are using this
factory and entering the caves
from there. Would you be willing
to go with me?
41.

ABEL
If by some devilish way you are
right, I have to stay and work out
a way to protect the members of my
parish.

Erik removes a cardboard box filled with short wooden
stakes.

ERIK
You're a good man Father, you
always have been. You have to do
what you feel is the right thing
to do, thank you for your time.

ABEL
I hope you're wrong. But if you're
not, God be with you.

ERIK
And may he be with you too.

Erik opens the front door for him and he heads to his car
without looking back. The wind whistles down the street.

A large German Shepherd sleeps on the front steps of the
house directly opposite.

Erik eyes it nervously and shuts and locks his front
door.

JAMI
I'd like to go with you.

ERIK
Thank you Miss Yearwood but I warn
you, this is not for the weak
hearted.
JAMI
I know. Now let's go!
INT/EXT. DAN'S CAR - DAY

Dan paces back and forth between his car and front door.

DAN
Damn it, Kyeema!

Kyeema charges out of the front door with bags in hand.

KYEEMA
What's the problem?
42.

DAN
We're going to miss the plane.

KYEEMA
I'm going as fast as I can.

Dan grabs her bags and throws them into the back of the
car. They both get inside the vehicle.

KYEEMA
I was making something for you.

She reaches into her pocket and pulls out something
wrapped in tissue paper and tied with a rubber band.

DAN
What is it?

KYEEMA
It keeps evil away. You must
always carry it in your pocket.

Dan nods, slips it inside his jacket, and starts the car.

DAN
How about yours?

Kyeema sits quietly as Dan drives off.

DAN
You did make one for yourself,
didn't you?

KYEEMA
No. You wanted me to hurry.

Dan digs in his coat pocket.

DAN
Keep this one then.

Kyeema grabs his wrist firmly.

KYEEMA
No Daniel. It won't work for me.
It has a few strands of your hair--
Watch where you're friggin-well-
going!

Dan looks back to the road as a Porsche tears past him in
the opposite direction.

They take the AIRPORT EXIT, and traffic slows to an
almost stop.
43.

DAN
We're going to be fine. We'll get
ourselves a room at a nice resort
on the beach and lay out in the
sun for a week.

KYEEMA
What's going to happen to these
people?

DAN
I don't know... Just want to get
as far away from here, as soon as
possible.

KYEEMA
How will we know if any place is
ever far enough away?

Dan doesn't really hear, as he sees the highway become
nothing but a parking lot.

DAN
No, no, no!

KYEEMA
What time is it?

DAN
Almost four. Shit! We're going to
miss our plane.

KYEEMA
But... They come out when it's
dark--

DAN

I know! You haven't shut up about
them since last night!

Dan punches the steering wheel. Kyeema wells up.

DAN
I'm sorry...

Kyeema nods but doesn't look at him. Dan peers out a
window.

DAN
Do you know where I'd like to be
right now? A beach in Maldives.
How would you like that?
44,

KYEEMA
Yes...

INT/EXT. ERIK'S CAR - DAY

Now dusk, Jami and Erik sit in Erik's knackered car ina
side street, neither one impressed with their current
predicament.

ERIK
Damn. Had a service only last
week.

JAMI
We could make a run for it.

ERIK
I don't know. We are a good seven,
eight blocks. Is that a bit too
far?

It grows steadily darker outside.

JAMI
What about the other houses?

ERIK
Maybe but do you see any lights
on? How do we know we aren't
stepping into a nest full of
vampires? My house was protected.
These are just inviting invasion.

JAMI
Are you suggesting we just sit
here?

ERIK

We can't. It's nearly dark.
Jami makes their minds up, and hops out of the car.

Erik quickly joins her and they move toward some dark
shapes on the right hand side of the street.

A two-story house with no lights on materializes through
the darkness.

Erik almost steps on the corpse of a YOUNG GIRL, pushed
into the gutter.

Erik pulls a horrified Jami along and they rush to the
front door.
45.

ERIK
Stay close.

INT/EXT. ABANDONED HOUSE - NIGHT

Erik turns the front door handle, it opens, and they
quickly enter

And Erik slams the door shut, bolts it behind him.

ERIK
We should be safe here.

Erik scans the area.

JAMI
What if we're not alone?

Erik shouts up the stairs.

ERIK
Hello! Anyone home?

Erik takes his gun out of his holster and walks into a
short --
HALLWAY

-- where a flight of stairs leads up to a --

SECOND FLOOR
They step into the landing, and huddle close.

ERIK
Anyone here?

No reply.

He puts his gun away and returns to the --

LIVING ROOM
Erik turns to Jami, a worried look on his face.

ERIK
I think we're alone. And that is
exactly where they want us.
46.

JAMI
What? In this house?

ERIK
Trapped. All of us. Everyone in
this cursed city.

INT. CHURCH - NIGHT
Many people huddle inside the church.

The Father stands guard at the front door, and looks for
more people.

Occasionally a figure moves way off in the distance. He
has a brainwave and turns to Leon.

ABEL
Leon.

Leon looks up. There is fear in his face.

LEON
Yes, Father.

ABEL
You know where the staircase to
the bell tower is, don't you?

LEON
Yes.

ABEL
I want you to climb to the tower,
and crack open the shutters up
there, you'll see the handles.
Then I want you to take the rope
that hangs down and pull on it as
hard as you can. The bell may lift
you off your feet, but that's all
right, you'll come down again.
Just don't let go of the rope, and
keep ringing the bell. Can you do
that?

Leon nods excitedly at the important mission.

INT. DAN OLIVER'S MERCEDES - NIGHT

Dan and Kyeema still stuck in a parking lot of a highway.
47.

DAN
We can't stay here. I know it's
dark, but we have to go.

KYEEMA
Go where?

DAN
Anywhere but here!

KYEEMA
You don't have to yell.

DAN
Kyeema, I'm sorry, but we can't
just wait in the dark to die.

KYEEMA
What about all these other people?

DAN
They are not our problem. That
exit leads back to town, we're
close enough to walk.

INT. RED TENEMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Abel enters the tenement, and he bangs on the first door.

ABEL
Charlie! Get your wife and
children! You're going to have to
come to the church with me!

EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

As Dan and Kyeema move in and out of traffic, they find
fewer and fewer cars running with less and less people in
them.

DAN
I've got a bad feeling about this.

KYEEMA
Me too, let's run.

DAN
Can you hear that bell ringing?

They jog down an off ramp when Dan hears a rumble in the
distance.
48.

He looks over his shoulder and sees
Headlights move quickly toward them.

Motorcycles, fifteen or twenty of them. Dan waves them
down.

DAN
Hey! Over here!

KYEEMA
Wait Dan. I don't think...

The bikers lights turn toward them and as they pass under
the streetlights it shows the bikers pale faces, with a
mouthful of killer fangs.

Dan grabs Kyeema to make their escape, but the bikers are
on top of them.

One biker lashes out and lands a well-timed boot into
Dan's rib cage and he hits the ground fighting for
breath.

Kyeema is so petrified she cannot even scream.

STITCH
Hellloooo!

Dan rolls over in agony and he sees the blue goatee, red
ponytail of Walter, who not only rides a Hog but is now a
Vampire

WALTER
There isn't very much to this one.

BUTCH
Stitch! You said I get the next.

Walter jerks his head back and suddenly rubs and blinks
his eyes.

WALTER
Holy shit, what is that! My eyes
are fuckin' on fire!

Walter leaps off and backs away from Dan.

WALTER
He's got something on his clothes...
garlic or something. Gaaaah, I
can't see.
49,

STITCH
Forget him. He will be dead soon
enough.

WALTER

God, If I don't die first, I can
see the front page now.

STITCH
Come on ladies, saddle up.

He turns to Dan.

STITCH
I'm taking your woman with me.
I'll be keeping her nice and warm,
you just lay there and think about
that, okay?

As the glow from the bikers headlights fades into the
darkness, Dan painfully gets to his feet.

The bell still sounds, as he slowly makes his way down
the off ramp.

INT. RED TENEMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Now a long human chain of people, all ages, shapes and
sizes. Abel briefs before he leads them back to the
church. Still the Bell chimes in the background.

ABEL
Listen, all of you! We're going
to follow the sound of the bell
back to the church. Everyone grab
the shoulder of the person in
front of you and hold on tight!

People look scared and mutter among themselves.

ABEL
Don't be afraid, just hold on
tight! As long as we stay together
we will be fine.

The line of people exit the front doors and out to the --

STREETS
A deathly scream pierces the night, and then fades away.

ABEL
Keep moving!
50.

ALVIN
Mrs. Mandell is gone! Something
pulled her out of the chain!

ABEL
Holy God in heaven...

Another scream fades into the distance.

MARY
Fiona!? What happen' to my little
girl? FIOONNNAAAAAA!

The woman tries to leave the chain.

ABEL
Hold on to her! Keep going!

A female figure runs in front of him, and flashes a huge
set of fangs.

She grins, and just as quick as she appeared, she
disappears.

Suddenly another scream sounds out from the back of the
chain.

ABEL
Faster! Come on keep moving!

Movement and dark shapes seems to FLIT all around them.

ABEL
We're here!

Abel feels Alvin's hand let go of his shoulder.

Abel turns and sees that Alvin and his wife have gone.
Their daughter stands there shaking.

He grabs her hand and ushers the remaining people inside
the --

CHURCH

-- where he ushers them into a far corner.

ABEL
John, go up to the tower and take
over the bell from Leon. Keep
ringing until I send someone else
up.
51.

He picks up a heavy brass crucifix and quickly walks back
to the front door and out into the --
STREET

Abel is about to enter another building, when a voice
cries out.

JUNE
Father Stonestreet! Help me!

He looks up at a grey building. On the second floor, a
little girls face peers from a window pane.

A hand pulls her back away from the window.

INT. GREY BUILDING - NIGHT
Abel looks around, trying to get his bearings.

ABEL
June? Its Father Stonestreet! Where
are you?

Muffled sobs come from behind a nearby door.

He busts in, crucifix still in hand, she is standing in
the corner, bare feet and dark rings under her eyes.

ABEL
Oh my. Thank God I've found you.

He bends down and pick's her up. Her arms hang limply.

ABEL
Are you all right?

JUNE
Yes. Thank you Father.

ABEL
June, where is the bad man who
took you?

Her eyes grow wide and she stares past Abel.

CUTTER
Behind you.

Abel places June down and turns to face him.

ABEL
Stay behind me, June.
52.

Cutter grins, his fangs slide out of his upper and lower
jaws.

CUTTER
Everything old is new again. Like
the new look?

Abel hoists the crucifix, Cutter raises his hands in mock
fear.

ABEL
I warned you Cutter.

DEALER
You do realize crucifixes don't
hurt us?

Dealer moves very quickly toward Abel, who stands his
ground.

Abel swings the crucifix in a large, vicious arc as
though it were a bat.

It rips Cutter's head clean off, and rolls into a corner.
His body crumples to the floor at Abel's feet.

ABEL
You were saying?

The body withers to a husk.
EXT. CHURCH - NIGHT

Abel carries June in his arms and rushes to the front
door of the church.

A hand lunges out of the darkness grabbing Stonestreet’s
shoulder.

In one twisting fluid movement Stonestreet grabs the
hand, sets June down and swings around pulling what's
attached to the hand toward him for a beating.

The face of Dan Oliver appears in front of Stonestreet,
tired, dazed and confused.

DAN
No, don’t. Please... Help me!
INT. LAIR (ROOM)- NIGHT

Rolland surveys the map of the city, spread out over the
large heavy table.
53.

Stitch is on his right, and Hagen on his left.

STITCH
I've had reports from the north
and the south. They are all
panicking, trying to escape.

ROLLAND
Were they stopped?

STITCH
Mostly. But we--

ROLLAND
Were they stopped?

STITCH
We need more troops to patrol the
city.

ROLLAND

No escapes, no survivors, no
excuses. Do you understand? I want
those gaps filled.

STITCH
Immediately, Master.

ROLLAND
Good. And riders, how many do we
command now?

STITCH
Thirty five hundred. Another
fifteen hundred will be ready
tomorrow night.

ROLLAND
We are so close Mr. Stitch. It's
time to sleep, and sleep well.

Rolland watches Stitch leave but Hagen stays put.

ROLLAND
Yes?

HAGEN
Shall I feed the dogs?

ROLLAND
No, not yet. Just make sure
they're out at sunrise.

Rolland’s attention falls back to the map, mesmerized.
54.

INT. ABANDONED HOUSE - NIGHT

Erik sits at the kitchen table, a bowl of fruit in front
of him. He chews on an apple.

Jami has her head in the fridge.

JAMI
So, what happens at dawn.

ERIK
What do you mean?

JAMI
The vampires go crawling to their
coffins or whatever, what about
us? What do we do?

Erik is silent for a moment.

ERIK
We must finish what we started.

JAMI
Why Brisbane? Why not somewhere
important like Canberra?

ERIK
I'm not sure, but imagine a city
of vampires. If they take
Brisbane, what's to stop them
taking the whole country, city by
city... State by state.

JAMI
How are we going to get to the
master?

ERIK
I don't know.

JAMI
I'm going to try to get some
sleep. God knows I need it.

Jami gets up and heads for the stairs.

She makes her way up the stairs and opens the door of the
first room on the top landing.

It is a bedroom. She spots a couple of pillows on the
bed, but the blankets had been kicked off the bed.
55.

She grabs both pillows and turns to walk back out. As she
reaches the door of the bedroom, something clicks in her
brain.

JAMI
(sotto)
Oh shit. The sheets are missing.

She turns back and scans the room, something shifts
heavily, plus the noise of cloth being ripped.

JAMI
Oh no. Erik!

The wardrobe door slowly swings open and a cocoon shape
writhes out from inside.

JAMI
Nooooo!

A body tumbles out of the wardrobe, a grey haired man,
his legs still wrapped in a bed sheet.

He looks up at Jami, and gives her a warm grandfatherly
smile.

Jami backs cautiously out of the bedroom.

A woman's head pops out of a cocoon under the bed. Jami
screams.

She boogies down the stairs, but the grey haired vampire
is just too quick.

He grabs her by the hair and jerks her back.
She loses her balance and falls back, lands at his feet.
Erik stands at the foot of the stairs.

The vampire crawls on top of Jami and has his fangs
fractions from her throat.

The vampire looks up, seems to sense something isn't
right.

Erik jams a stake through his mouth and the tip Breaches
the very back of his skull.

The vampire reels back and struggles to rip the stake
from his head.

The Female Vampire appears at the top of the stairs and
helps her partner pull the stake out.
56.

With a grunt she manages to dislodge it and drops it onto

the floor. They share a look and run into the room they
came from.

A crash as splintered wood and glass blast on to the
street as they jump out the window and off into the
night.

Erik and Jami watch as the two figures slip off into the
night.

ERIK
Sorry, my fault. I should've
checked more thoroughly. Are you
all right?

JAMI
Let me get my breath back, okay?

Erik walks down the stairs.

ERIK
Good. Let's check the whole house.

They go toward the basement door.

JAMI
How long until sunrise?

ERIK
Five hours or so.

INT. CHURCH - DAY

Abel checks on Dan, huddled on a pew with a blanket
wrapped around his shoulders.

DAN
Father, did a woman come in last
night? Aboriginal, very beautiful?

ABEL
I am so sorry. No one came in
after you.

Dan nods, half-smiles but is on the verge of tears. His
wounds have been dressed.

DAN
They took her. It was my fault
they took her.
57.

ABEL
What's your name, son?

DAN
Dan. Dan Oliver.

ABEL
Dan, you need to rest.

Dan winces with pain.

DAN
How bad am I?

ABEL
Nothing serious. How do you feel?

DAN
Pretty fucked... Sorry Father.

Dan looks at a brightening window.

ABEL
Where do you think the riders
went?

DAN

I don’t know But I’ve got to do
something. I've got to find my

wife.

ABEL
You're not going anywhere. You
need rest.

DAN

Father. You didn't see them. You
don't know what they are, what
they could do to her--

ABEL
How far do you think you'll get?
How will you help her? You don't
even know where you're going.

He can see the anger build in Dan's eyes and tries to
calm.

ABEL
Would you like some water?

DAN
No. I should try to get some rest.

ABEL
All right. If you'll excuse me.
58.

Abel moves quickly away from Dan.

INT. ABANDONED HOUSE (LOUNGE) - DAY
Jami suddenly jolts up and screams.
She looks all around, Erik stares out of the window.

ERIK
Good morning.

Erik turns back to the window and continues to look out.
JAMI
Morning... Bad dream. They were
all over me.

Erik acknowledges with a slight nod.

JAMI
How are we going to get there?

ERIK
Drive a few blocks west, then head
north.

JAMI

Drive? The car wouldn't start?
ERIK
Our lovely couple left us a car
with a full tank.
JAMI
Let's load up and move out before

they return with the rest of the
family.

Together, they head out.

INT. CHURCH - DAY
People tend to each other. Some still sleep, some cry.

Abel moves from group to group, tries his best to set
everyone at ease.

A few others help pass around water, and attend to the
injured.

Dan off to the side looks in deep thought.

An elderly lady comes by to check on him
59.

Dan stands and moves to the front doors. He unbolts it

as Abel appears right behind him.

ABEL
And where do you think you're
going?

DAN

Just stay out of my way, Father. I
appreciate your help, but I've got
to help Kyeema.

Dan tries to move past Abel, but Abel grabs him by the

collar.
ABEL
How do you expect to find her on
foot?
DAN

I'm taking the Land Rover outside.

ABEL
Do you really think you can just
drive in, kill the bad guys, save
your wife and walk out?

DAN
I have to do something.

ABEL
Daniel, she may already be like
them.

DAN

But maybe she's not... Maybe
there's some reason why they
didn't just kill her there and
then. And if she is still alive...
then she needs me.

ABEL
Wait here.

DAN
Why?

Abel speaks to the other helpers and they all hug him.

He returns to Dan and gives him a small nod.

ABEL
All right. Let's go.
60.

DAN
Huh?

ABEL
I know where they might be keeping
her and the Land Rover’s mine.

INT/EXT. LAND ROVER (MOVING) - DAY

Dan changes gears and they zip through a corner.
The dashboard is lit up like an aeroplane cockpit.
Abel scans the road up ahead.

DAN
Why are you helping me?

ABEL
It's the right thing to do.

DAN
Fine with me.

INT/EXT. CAR (MOVING)- DAY

Erik struggles to negotiate the many abandoned cars and
makes very slow progress.

He slams his hand down on the horn in total frustration.

ERIK
It's going to be sunset again
before we get there through this.

JAMI
Maybe it will clear further on
down the road.

ERIK
Maybe, maybe not. It would almost
be quicker to walk.

Erik and Jami share a thoughtful stare for a moment.

The car screeches to a halt and both get out. Erik grabs
the backpack and they carry on, at a slow jog.

They pass ditched cars, bikes and trucks.

They pass ditched cars, bikes trucks as they cross roads
and footpaths.
61.

INT/EXT. LAND ROVER - DAY
The Land Rover slows to a crawl.

ABEL
Why are we stopping?

DAN
I'm not sure but I think I saw
something back there. That
warehouse on the right about fifty
meters back. Looked like coffins,
stacked upon the dock... least I
think they were coffins.

Dan quickly reverses.

On the dock a pile is covered with a dark green
tarpaulin. It flutters a few times and expose many
coffins beneath.

DAN
There!

Dan points at the coffins.

DAN
I'm going in.

ABEL
Not on your own.
EXT. WAREHOUSE (LOADING DOCK) - DAY
The warehouse is the size of a football field.

On the dock, Dan pulls the tarpaulin off the caskets. The
wind whips it away. He opens the lid. Empty.

ABEL
I wouldn't sleep outside. Would
you?

Dan looks toward a large sliding door set in the wall. He
opens it a few feet, and steps into the --
WAREHOUSE

A few forklift trucks, plus row after row, after row -—
absolutely thousands of coffins.
62.

DAN
Jesus Christ. This is where they
sleep. My God! How many warehouses
like this do you think there are?

Dan leans over and opens the casket nearest him.

Inside is a young man, with a blood spotted shirt, his
arms crossed over his chest.

Very softly, Dan hears a small voice whisper --

SOFT VOICE
Lean in just a little bit closer.

Dan quickly closes the coffin lid with his foot.

Abel opens a coffin. In it is a little black girl, her
skin is faded to a sick pasty gray.

She shifts suddenly, grips the caskets sides, then lay
still again.

Abel closes the lid, shaken.

DAN
Help me drag one into the light.

They get either end of the first casket Dan opened, and
push and pull it back out onto the loading dock and into
the bright sunlight.

DAN
Ready?

Dan flips the lid off and steps back. The vampire
instantly writhes and claws at the sides of the casket.

Its mouth opens and screams like nothing you’ve ever
heard before in your life!

The vampire sits up violently. Its gaze has fallen upon
Abel and raises its head twisted at an angle away from
the sunlight.

Dan shoves Abel back inside the warehouse, and slides the
door shut.

The vampire hurtles forward and frantically tries to open
the metal door.

Both men struggle to keep it out. The door shudders as
the vampire hammers and then scratches at it like an
animal.
63.

The clawing stops. Abel looks behind him, thinks he can
hear something.

DAN
It's a trick.

Dan slides the door slightly. The lid is back on the
casket. As the door opens wider, Abel hears more noises
as light streams into the warehouse.

Dan steps back out onto the loading dock and throws open
the lid again.

The vampire, hideously bloated, sits up and snaps at
Dan's face.

Fluids bubble beneath the things flesh.

It leaks from the mouth, eyes and nose. Just as it looks
like it will explode, it rapidly shrivels into something
as thin and frail as a dead leaf.

Dan vomits. Abel looks toward the warehouse again.

Abel rushes to the Land Rover and grabs stuff from the
tailgate.

He returns with a can of fuel and a .45 jammed in his
belt.

ABEL
Start the car.

DAN
Where did you get that gun? What
are you going to do?

ABEL
What we are here to do.

Dan catches a wake up. Abel goes into the warehouse as he
quickly jumps back inside the
INT/EXT. LAND ROVER (MOVING) - DAY

Dan turns on the ignition as a gunshot sounds out. He
jumps.

Bloodcurdling screams sound out from inside the
warehouse.

Thick black smoke fills the sky.
64.
Abel hops into the Land Rover.

ABEL
Drive. Very, very fast.

Dan blasts the Land Rover through the front gates.

DAN
Do you think they will all burn?

ABEL
Some of them will. And if they do
get out, the sunlight will finish
them.

DAN
I didn't know there were so many.

ABEL
What if there are a hundred more
places like this.

Abel takes the gun out of his pants and lays it on the
floor.

ABEL
You never know when it might come
in handy.

DAN
It's almost one. We have to
hurry...

EXT. STREET —- DAY

Erik stops to catch his breath. Jami looks him over.

JAMI
You okay?

ERIK
Yeah, it's been a while since I've
had to run so much.

JAMI
I didn't think it would take so
long.

ERIK

Not far now.

They take off again at a brisk walk.
65.

They pass a shop that has all the windows blacked out
with paper and various other items.

INT/EXT. LAND ROVER - DAY

A parking lot of abandoned cars and trucks force Dan and
Abel to stop.

ABEL
We're going to have to make it on
foot the rest of the way. How far
is it?

DAN

I don't know.

ABEL
What you find may not be the
person you knew.

DAN
I know.

ABEL
Then you also know that once we
get in there, we may not be coming
out.

Dan nods.
Abel and Dan gear up and start to hike up the road.

Abel sees something move up ahead, something quick and
smaller than a man. He pulls the gun out.

There's another quick movement off to the right in the
bushes.

Sudden a huge reddish brown mongrel, with bright yellow
eyes leaps out at them.

The dog drops to the ground, his skull split open by a
bullet.

Something strikes the back of Dan's knees he staggers and
wrenches his leg away from a collie.

He turns and kicks the dog in the ribs. Abel shoots it in
the head.

ABEL
We can't stop now.
66.

Dogs come from out of everywhere and circle the two men.

Abel fires off a few rounds. A few yelps, and they all
disperse.

ABEL
Hurry, they'll be back.

The road straightens with factories on all around.

Huge, dark and forbidding, the biggest of which has
lights on inside, with trucks and bikes parked around it.

A metal fence surrounds it. Dan and Abel check it out.

ABEL
How do we get over that?

DAN
I'm not letting a fence stop me
now.

They walk down the drive toward the large obstacle with a
tangle of barbed wire six feet above.

Dan climbs over the fence as Abel boosts him up.

INT. LAIR (ROOM) - DAY
All we can see is a close up of a closed eyelid.

Slowly the camera pulls back to reveal Rolland's sleeping
face.

Suddenly his eyes flick open.

Something is wrong. Something is out of place.
Dogs howl, but they are howls of fear and anger.
Rolland realizes something isn't right.

He moves to the door, unbolts it and stands in the long
hallway.

ROLLAND
Hagen.

Rolland's voice echoes and moves throughout the lair.

There is chatter among other vampires, but it all
silences as they hear their master call.
67.

ROLLAND
Hagen!

Hurried steps thunder down the hallway as Hagen rushes to
get to his master.

ROLLAND
Where were you?

HAGEN
Starting the fire in the council
chamber. It is ready for you,
Master.

ROLLAND
The dogs are disquieted. Someone
may have gotten past them.

HAGEN
How? Who? Where are they?

ROLLAND
Come with me.

Rolland moves past Hagen along the cave like corridor to
a narrow stairway that curves up to a double bolted door.

He unlocks it and steps into a
SECURITY ROOM

With a bank of glowing monitors. Security cameras
covering every angle outside.

Dusk has taken hold on its journey toward darkness. The
dogs howl off in the distance.

Rolland scans the monitors as Hagen looks on.

At first he can see nothing, everything seems normal.
Then he catches movement outside the main gate as he sees
Dan and Abel slink through the grounds.

Slowly he smiles and turns to Hagen.

ROLLAND
Find Mr. Stitch. You and he bring
those two to the council chamber.
And understand, I don't want them
touched. Not yet.

Hagen nods and scurries out the door.

Rolland leans toward the monitor watching them.
68.

He cracks up as he laughs his long fangs slide out of
their sockets in his jaws.
INT. LAIR - DAY

Hagen rushes through narrow corridors, tunnels and stair
cases. The cave system under the factory is a maze in its
layout.

He reaches a solid door and bashes on it

HAGEN
Stitch! We have intruders and the
master wants to see them.

A bolt slides across steel and wood then the Door swings
inward.

The room is totally black and Hagen strains to see
inside. Stitch gives him the creeps.

HAGEN
The master wants me to go with you
to collect them.

He moves forward slightly, still trying to see into the
black.

HAGEN
Hello? Mr. Stitch?

Hagen moves closer, strains his eyes even more.
Two red eyes open and look directly at him.

Hagen jumps back in fright as Stitch strides out of the
room and laughs in a mean-spirited sort of way.

STITCH
How many and where?
EXT. LAIR - DAY

Dan and Abel hug the side of the factory as they make
there way to the back of the old building, passing bikes,
trucks and other items of equipment and vehicles.

They find a half open roller door and slowly approach it.

DAN
Okay, here we go. Are you ready?
69.

ABEL
God help us.

INT. LAIR —- DAY

Dan and Abel enter a loading dock type area the air is
thick with the rotting stench of dog shit.

The pair try not to vomit as they start to gag on the
smell.

ABEL
This must be where those dogs came
from.

They quickly move to the back of the dock and into a
small passage.

They cut through a large arch, and emerge on the factory
floor. There is barely any light now. Rubbish is
everywhere.

The inside of the old factory is empty, totally gutted.
The pair begin to look worried until Dan spots a set of
stairs leading down.

DAN
It looks like we go down there.

Abel freezes. He signals to Dan to be quiet.

ABEL
Did you hear that?

Abel and Dan move back to back and slowly head toward the
stairs. Now night no more sunlight to save them as the

vampires wake.

The sound of hundreds of vampires as they stir, begin to
filter down to the factory floor: CRIES, CREAKS, LOUD
BANGS, WHISPERS AND LAUGHTER.

DAN
You think they know we’re here?

ABEL
Pretty damn sure of it.

They continue down to the --

FIRST LEVEL

-- where dark shapes move around on the cave floor.
70.

The staircase for the next level down is on the opposite
side of the large space, they set off at a quick pace.

Halfway to the staircase a grubby hungry looking vampire
woman steps out of a dark recess.

Dan is directly in her line of sight as she leaps at him.

Dan lands flat on his back, which knocks the wind out of
him.

She throws her head back, and prepares to strike. Then a
flash of black as a massive boot cracks her in the face.

Abel helps Dan to his feet, and steps in front of him as
the female vampire readies herself. She crouches on the
ground like a spider, ready to jump.

Suddenly a look of fear washes over her face as she backs
off, and scurries away like a cockroach.

A meaty punch and the sound of a dead weight hitting the
floor makes Abel spin around.

Stitch, grins wickedly as Hagen scoops Dan up and throws
him over his shoulder.

ABEL
Put him down.

STITCH
The master wants to see you.

Abel sees Dan is still alive, he can feel the anger of
old washing over him again. He sinks his hands deep into
his pockets.

ABEL
I told you, put him down. I won't
tell you again.

Stitch finds Abel funny and laughs, he looks at Hagen,
who smiles wildly.

Abel has the one chance he’s prayed for, and pulls his
brass-knuckle clad hands out of his pockets.

Hagen's expression drops as he sees what Stitch can't.

Abel takes a massive swing, as Stitch turns back toward
him.

The mighty punch connects and spins Stitch around.
71.

Stitch rides the momentum of the punch and spins with a
body blow which lifts Abel off his feet and sends him

Flying down the walk way.
Stitch breaths heavy and bleeds from the mouth.

He stalks over Abel who lays there and groans on his
back.

He stares at him for a moment, before he hoisting him
over his shoulder.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Erik sees a small road that he recognizes as the one that
leads to the street.

ERIK
We're close The factory's at the
top of this road!

Erik turns to Jami.

ERIK
You okay?

JAMI
As good as can be expected.

ERIK
Then let's do what we came for.

They pass the Land Rover that Dan and Abel left, past a
few dead dogs. A howling all around them but the dogs
keep their distance.

As the old factory appears out of the gloom both stop in
their tracks in awe.

ERIK
My God, help us.

A loud piercing whistle screeches through the night. The
howling of the dogs stop as they all run off.

ERIK
Feeding time. Let's find out where
they are going.

They follow the massive gate around to an opening where
the dogs whine and bark.
72.

The mechanical clatter of gears and chains as the barking
dies down.

Jami runs ahead and sees the dogs scurry in where the
driveway turns under an arch and into the factory's rear
courtyard.

An internal gate has been hoisted open just enough for
the dogs to get through.

HAGEN
Hurry, you bastards! Come on!
Inside!

Jami squeezes herself against a wall. She hears the gate
slowly close.

As soon as everyone is gone, she slides over to the gate
and peers in.

Some removal vans, a yellow bull dozer, and a black van.

Jami sees Hagen throw open a heavy wooden door, the dogs
scramble over each other and try to get through.

A couple snarl and snap at Hagen, he picks up a huge
wooden staff and whacks a few.

HAGEN
Get down there! You bastards!

When all the dogs are in, he steps through the door, and
closes it behind him.

Erik appears over Jami's shoulder.

ERIK
He must be still human.

He curls his hands around the bars. He looks the gate up
and down, and scrapes some of the dirt away from the
bottom, it comes away quite easily.

ERIK
God bless those dogs.

The gap is still very small; Jami takes her Market off
and squeezes through.

She runs over to the chain hanging down from a couple of
iron pulleys along the wall, and gets the gate about two
feet off the ground. Just enough for Erik to get through.

Together, they hurry to the heavy wooden door.
73.

The door is locked, Erik gives it three hard blows with
the hammer and it gives way.
INT. LAIR - NIGHT
ERIK
I don't think the vampires will
sleep with the dogs. Let's go in.

The sound of dogs is getting louder.

HAGEN (V.O.)
Get back! I'll knock your ribs in!

A dog growls, then there is a blow and several yelps.
They approach the half open door and see Hagen's back.

HAGEN
Get back, there! Here. You shit!

The dogs snap at the food Hagen throws to them.

Erik tightens his grip on the hammer then slips into the
room.

Quickly and quietly he moves toward Hagen. Before he can
reach him a few dogs begin to growl.

Erik runs headlong at Hagen who swings his staff around
and

Clips Erik in the hand; they both fall to the ground.

Hagen has a vice like grip around Erik's hammer hand, the
other hand around Erik's throat.

The dogs grab at cuffs and sleeves and snap at their
faces.

Erik strikes Hagen square in the face. Blood streams from
his nose but Hagen just grins madly as his grip on Erik's
neck tighten.

Hagen rolls Erik onto his back and pins his hammer hand
with his knee. He tightens his other hand around Erik's
throat.

Dogs fight with each other and nip at Erik and Hagen.

Jami rushes into the room, picks up the staff and swings
it into the back of Hagen's head.
74.

JAMI
Get off him!

She strikes him again and when she strikes him for a
third time the staff breaks in half.

Hagen pitches to the side; his head hits the cold stone
floor with a solid thud.

Erik gasps for air as he stands and rubs his neck, he
slowly backs away from the dogs.

JAMI
Is he dead? Did I kill him?

The dogs fight over the body, and try to drag the body
all around the floor. They chew on his ears and fingers.

ERIK
No, Jami. You didn't, but I don't
think they feed the dogs very
well.

They close the door behind them as the dog's growl and
yelp and the fighting reaches fever pitch.

The sound of flesh and material tearing and wet splatters
as the door is shut.

Hammer in one hand, and torch in the other, Erik heads
off into the darkness, with Jami at his side.

INT. LAIR - COUNCIL CHAMBER - NIGHT
Rolland stares at Dan and Abel.

ROLLAND
Mr. Stitch, have you ever
considered just how clever these
humans are.

Dan and Abel crouch on the floor near the fire place.
Rolland admires the .45 on the table picking it up.

ROLLAND
Imagine If Alexander the Great had
possessed such toys, how long
would it have been before the
entire world fell at his feet?
Could you imagine?

Rolland sits in a chair, crossing his legs under him.
75.

ROLLAND
But then again. What he lacked in
modern toys, he more than made up
for with an unstoppable army. This
city is about to witness Rolland
Marmerchant's unstoppable army.
And as it rolls across this
retched land there will be nowhere
to run.

He leans back, and looks from Dan to Abel. He stares at
Abel's grimy white collar.

ROLLAND
So, we have a priest. You won't be
the first to join us, I promise
you. Nor the last.

Rolland's gaze turns to Dan.

DAN
Where is my wife!?

ROLLAND
Excuse me?

DAN
The woman he took from me.

Dan motions in Stitch's direction.

ROLLAND
You risked your life for a woman?
Fascinating.

Rolland stares at Dan harder. Dan tries to look away, but
cant.

ROLLAND
I have existed in the world long
enough to forget such things as
love. Mr Stitch do you know who he
is referring to? Is she here?

STITCH
Yes Master. Upstairs, still
sleeping.

ROLLAND

Then bring her down here! And find
Hagen as well. He's taken too
long.
76.

Stitch nods and leaves the room.

ROLLAND
Both of you have shown great
courage today. You will make
worthy additions to my army.

He looks toward Abel.

ROLLAND
And you, preacher man, I'll show
you just how much power a real God
has.

Abel lifts his head, locking eyes with Rolland. Rolland
laughs out loud, letting his fangs slide out.

ROLLAND
What were you planning to do? We
have been around before your God
ever existed. No man, no one, no
thing can kill me!

Abel glares back at him, unafraid.

ABEL
You are an arrogant fool.

In one sweeping motion he leaps from his chair and lands
right next to Abel.

One hand grips around his face, finger nails break his
skin.

ROLLAND
With one hand I could twist the
head from your body, so be very
careful indeed!

Rolland's fingers tighten. Abel doesn't stop staring at
Rolland.

Rolland loosens his grip and steps back. Dan crawls over
to Abel to check on him.

The council chamber door bursts open as

Erik is pushed through with Jami following as they
stagger through.

Stitch brings in Kyeema and closes the door behind him.
77.

STITCH
I found these two in the factory.
They must have killed Hagen, the
woman had this.

Stitch throws the large staff Hagen used to work the dogs
with into the centre of the room

STITCH
The man was carrying a pack full
of stakes, a hammer. The whole
kit.

Rolland looks intensely at Erik.
Dan slowly rises from the floor.

DAN
Kyeema?

She looks at him with frightened eyes and takes a step
back.

Stitch grabs her neck and forces her to look at Dan, as
she struggles to look away from him.

STITCH
There's your lover. Like what you
see? Can you see the veins running
through his body? That's life,
your life from now on.

DAN
Leave her alone!

Dan tries to move over toward her.

ROLLAND
Sit down.

Dan's legs go dead and he drops instantly to the floor.
Erik notices Abel on the floor.

Rolland gets out of his seat and goes to Erik with great
interest.

ROLLAND
You know our kind, don't you? I
see it in your eyes.

ERIK
I know you well.
78.

ROLLAND
How is that?

ERIK
My wife was turned by one of you.

ROLLAND
Your wife. And yet here you stand.
I'm assuming you killed her then.
Did you cut her head off? Or did
you burn her to death, maybe?

Erik tries not to look him in the eyes, but he can't

stop.

ROLLAND
So, here you are. Ready to do it
again. I wonder if you will be as
lucky tonight?

ERIK
Why here? Why this city?

ROLLAND
Why? We no longer need you. Make
no mistake, this isn't a random
event. If you knew how long this
has taken. Not just this city or
this country. Every city. Every
country.

Rolland paces around the room, the conversation excites

him.

ROLLAND
By now we will have control of
Sydney, Melbourne and Perth.
Brisbane is falling as I speak.
The true dominant species will
soon rule the whole planet.
Natural order, balance will be
restored, no longer will we hide
like animals.

DAN

You need our blood to survive.

Do
Dan stands

Dan lunges

ROLLAND
we?

and looks at Kyeema, then back at Rolland.

for the .45 on the table. As his hand closes

on the gun, Rolland lunges at him, knocking him on his

back.
79.

Rolland stands over him. Dan aims upward and fires twice,
one goes through Rolland's throat and strikes the wall
behind him, the second passes through his stomach.

Rolland picks Dan up by the throat, fingers breaking
through the flesh as he squeezes.

He tosses him across the room to the feet of Stitch.

ROLLAND
He's all yours.

Stitch's eyes light up, and he kicks Dan square in his
chest.

The crack of bones as he slides across the room and he
crashes through chairs, and slams into a solid wall.

Stitch strides up to him, removes his gun from his
jacket, and grins widely as he shoots Dan in the head
three times.

Kyeema screams and sinks to her knees.
Rolland sweeps over to Abel and yanks him to his feet.
ROLLAND
You! I am going to enjoy turning
you!

Someone knocks at the door.

ROLLAND
Enter!

A YOUNG BOY with blonde hair enters and eyes the damage.

ROLLAND
What is it?

YOUNG BOY
The trucks, Master. They're ready
and loaded.

ROLLAND

Excellent. Go.

The boy looks at Dan's dead body, and hesitates.

ROLLAND
What else?

YOUNG BOY
Some of the others are talking,
Master.

(MORE)
80.
YOUNG BOY (CONT'D)
They say Hagen has been killed,
and we have infiltrated by humans.

ROLLAND
Tell them not to fear. As you
yourself can see, the humans are
in my possession. Tonight the city
falls. Now go.

He waits until the young vampire has left and turns to
his victims and flashes a sick smile.

ABEL
You'll be stopped.

ROLLAND
By you and your god? By them? By
the dead man on the floor?
Tomorrow night you will have
forgotten everything and everyone.

He looks toward Stitch.

ROLLAND
The priest is mine. You and the
female can have those two. When
you're finished, take that dead
filth and feed him to the dogs.

Rolland drags Abel across the room and throws him through
the open door into Rolland’s private quarters. Rolland
quickly follows, the door slams after him.

Stitch slides his gun back into his jacket and sings.

STITCH
Nowhere to run baby. Nowhere to
hide.

Erik and Jami back up slowly, and step through a puddle
of blood that seeps from Dan's head.

STITCH
You! Kyeema! You can have the
woman. I'm taking the old man.

Erik stumbles over the remains of a broken chair. He
wrenches a leg off -- he now had a two-foot club, with a
deadly-looking splintered end.

Kyeema slowly walks toward the body of Dan, bends down
and touches his face, then touches the blood on the
floor.
81.

She licks her fingers, shakes her head and lets out an
ear-piercing scream.

Stitch looks around in surprise as Erik plunges the
jagged end of the chair leg toward his heart.

It strikes, but is deflected by the gun in his jacket.
Stitch pulls the chair leg out of his chest.

STITCH
Close. But close doesn't really
cut it here.

In a move almost too quick to see, Erik's head is thrust
back and throat exposed.

Jami grabs his Market and tries to pull him off Erik but
Stitch just swats her to the floor.

Stitch's fangs slide out, suddenly from behind Kyeema
grabs Stitch, her fingernails dig deep into his face and
she rips away flesh.

Stitch throws himself backwards and tries to get Kyeema
off his back. They Roll all over the floor.

Erik jumps to his feet as Kyeema plunges her fingers in
Stitch's eye sockets.

Both eye balls burst. Black liquid leaks down his cheeks,
and he howls and twists in agony.

He gets a grip on Kyeema and they thrash maniacally
around on the floor and into the mouth of the raging --

FIREPLACE

Flames engulf them, and they quickly combust into hot
ash. In the --

PRIVATE QUARTERS
-- Rolland has Abel thrust up against the wall.

ROLLAND
Oh priest. Tonight my army marches
the streets as your kind hides in
holes. The human race has had its
time. Tonight will be humanity’s
last breath.
82.

Abel tries to laugh in his face, but can only manage a
pathetic gurgle as Rolland chokes him.

Abel grabs at Rolland's hands, and tries to get a breath.
Rolland's grip loosens ever so slightly.

ABEL
All I have heard tonight are the
ramblings of a madman, not a great
leader.

Rolland laughs and drops Abel to the floor. He enjoys
watching him gasping for air.

ROLLAND
Priest, I really don't know how to
tell you this. But, it's already
happened.

Abel's stare is cold like ice.

ROLLAND
Your city. Nay, your COUNTRY has
fallen to creatures like me.

Abel leaps to his feet, plunges his hands into his
pockets, and pulls out his brass-knuckles.

ROLLAND
I respect you for trying, but
maybe I hit you too hard earlier.
You're failing to comprehend the
basic facts. You. Have. Lost.

Rolland waits for some sort of reaction from him.

ROLLAND
Everyone one you know and love
will be like me by dawn. Have you
got it in you to kill every single
one of them, Priest?

Erik and Jami burst through the door, ragged splinters of
wood in hand.

They both rush toward Rolland, screaming bloody murder.
Rolland turns to face them, his fangs bared.
Abel launches himself at the back of Rolland.

His left arm hooks around his neck as he delivers some
huge body blows with his right.
83.

A shocked Rolland flails for Abel as Erik plunges his
stake through his right shoulder.

Rolland backhands Erik with his right hand and sends him
reeling across the room.

Rolland struggles to pull the steak out of his shoulder.

Abel still hangs on for dear life and tries to push the
steak deeper into his shoulder.

Jami's attack happens straight after Erik's, Rolland
thrashes around so much it is hard for her to get a clear
shot.

She lunges at him and strikes just below his heart.

Rolland roars in pain as he pulls the new steak out
quickly.

Abel tightens his grip and uses the distraction to get
him off balance and manages to get him off centre and tip
him backwards.

As he feels Rolland stagger, Abel puts every last ounce
of strength he has left to get him onto the ground.

Rolland hits the floor with a loud crack as his skull
bounces on the floor.

Abel, as nimble as a cat, does not waste a second, and
lands punch after punch into his face.

Erik holds Rolland's feet as Jami grabs her stake which
Rolland discarded.

This time her aim is true as she drives the stake clean
through his evil heart.

Rolland goes limp and quiet for a brief moment, starts to
choke and goes into seizure.

Jami and Erik back way the hell off.

Abel stands over him, he watches him twitch and shake
with cold angry eyes.

Abel raises a massive boot and stamps the stake all the
way home!

Rolland instantly stops moving and withers to a husk.

JAMI
Jesus!
84.

ABEL
I couldn’t agree more.

ERIK
Are you okay?

ABEL
Depends on what you mean by okay.

Abel looks towards the door.

ABEL
How does it look? Can we get out
of here now?

JAMI
We are clear to go.
INT. LAIR (CORRIDOR) - NIGHT

The corridor is filled with screams. Vampires come out of
the darkness and bump into them, then race away in a
panicked frenzy.

VAMPIRE PUNK
The master has fallen!

VAMPIRE HOOKER
The humans killed the master!

A few vampires start toward the group but stop and sniff
the blood of Rolland on Abel's hands.

A total look of fear washes all over them and they flee
from the slayer.

The dogs bay behind the shut door.

The group retrace their steps to where they come in.

EXT. LAIR (COURTYARD) - NIGHT

Vampires run across the courtyard with dazed looks across
their faces, some of them walk with their arms
outstretched and scream for their master.

Walter, arms full of books, closely watches Jami exit in
all the mayhem.

Erik hauls the gate up and ties it off. They run up the --
85.

DRIVEWAY
-- and sprint for the Land Rover.

ABEL
Get in!

Everyone piles into the

INT. LAND ROVER (MOVING) - NIGHT
The key is still inside the ignition, and they tear off.

The night is still, apart from the odd wail of a distant
vampire. Everyone is subdued in the car ride.

ABEL
This hasn't finished.

ERIK
I'd give it a few days before they
realize what has happened here.

JAMI
We stopped him, didn't we? We rout
the rest before they get organized
and we finish them.

ERIK
What then? There are only three of
uS...

ABEL

We can't be the only survivors.
There has got to be others? We'll
find them. Make a stand.

Abel seems lost in his own thoughts.

ERIK
We'll need supplies.

ABEL
I know exactly where to go.

Erik nods and looks out over the city as they race by...
Amongst the surrounding bushes, nothing but RED EYES
await an opportunity.

EXT. LAIR (COURT YARD) - NIGHT

Walter smiles as a headless chickens runs around without
direction.
86.

Several vampires hover around their motorbikes and he
shouts out at them.

WALTER
Saddle up!

They turn and stare back at him.

Walter's receptionist Sally appears, and seductively
wraps an arm around his waist.

Walter grins.
The bikers still seem a tad unsure what to do.
Walter exposes his fangs and increases in volume.

WALTER
I said. Saddle the fuck up!

They all look to each-other nervously. One by one they
climb on to their bikes and do as commanded.

Sally gets on the back of Walter's bike.
Walter fires up his Hog, the rest do the same.

BIKER 1
Who the fuck are you?

WALTER
I'm the body snatcher. Lets ride.

EXT. BRISBANE (STREETS) - MONTAGE - NIGHT

A mass of headlights pour out from warehouses throughout
the city, forming a massive group.

FADE TO BLACK.
