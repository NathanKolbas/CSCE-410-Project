FADE IN:

INT. DEEP IN THE EARTH -- DAY

BOB BROADHEAD positions a heavy-duty DRILL and BORES INTO THE
ROCK. A cloud of thick black DUST quickly envelops him. He
releases the trigger. Waits.

The dust clears revealing a JAGGED HOLE cut in the stone and
Bob turns quickly. Gestures.

A NERVOUS MAN steps into the artificial light. In contrast
to Bob, his face is hidden behind an enormous BREATHING MASK,
and through the thick lenses we see two very frightened eyes.
He carries EXPLOSIVE CHARGES.

Bob takes the first charge and slides it into the jagged
opening. Flips the switch--

A light on the explosive BLIPS ON, primed, and ready to blow.
They move down the wall and repeat the procedure, setting
half-a-dozen explosives into an equal number of newly-drilled
holes, flipping the switches.

Bob slips the last charge into the stone and pauses. Looks
at his associate. The bulky mask amplifies the man’s erratic
BREATHING. Bob flips the final switch. Across the entire
length of the rock face, the charge lights start to BLINK and
They turn and run like hell--

Bob hurries across the loose NARROW BOARDS serving as floor
in the tunnel. The nervous man slips off the planks into the
muck. Bob hoists him out and they duck into a nearby RECESS.
The blinking lights STOP and:

THE EXPLOSION SHAKES THE WALLS around them. DUST AND DEBRIS
BLASTS down the length of the tunnel and blocks out the view.

Slowly the dust begins to clear. Bob looks around. Listens.
The nervous man is too scared to move. His eyes shift left
and right. Finally he pulls off his mask, a relieved smile
spreading over his face. He turns to Bob. Starts to speak--

Bob gestures at him. Quiet!

From somewhere deep in the rock, there comes an eerie RUMBLE.
2.

Bob grabs him, and they run. DIRT AND SHALE POURS from the
ceiling in thick columns and

Suddenly the ROOF GIVES WAY and they are both BURIED ALIVE.
Only Bob’s hand reaches out of the dirt, searching for a
grip, grasping at the shale--

Inch-by-inch Bob slowly pulls himself out, his head first,
then his shoulders, torso. But he isn’t alone. Using all of
his strength and willpower, Bob pulls the other man free too.

They lie on the floor of the tunnel, exhausted, covered in
dirt, GASPING for breath and

The walls GROAN even louder--

Bob and his associate crawl across the floor of the tunnel,
but slowly. Much too slowly.

MORE COLUMNS OF DIRT begin to form. The men drag themselves
onto a small metal PLATFORM as the remainder of the TUNNEL
COLLAPSES in a storm of rock.

Bob reaches up, searching for a RED BUTTON. He finds it and

INT. ELEVATOR -- DAY

BOB holds on as the platform SHOOTS UPWARD through a narrow
shaft of rock. He struggles to stand. This is an open lift
and the walls of the shaft RACE PAST AT HIGH SPEED. Stick
out your arm and you lose it.

Slowly the NERVOUS MAN stirs. He tries to get up too, but
his legs give out. He slips:

His face stops less than an inch from the shaft wall speeding
past. Bob caught him. The man stares down at his own nose.
We see the TIP IS SCRAPED and

The elevator suddenly STOPS--

EXT. THE MINE -- DAY

BOB and the NERVOUS MAN are thrown out onto the surface, and
immediately react to the sun.

They are in the middle of a working mine. BIG LOADERS RUMBLE
PAST. The surrounding landscape is a dead, strip-mined hell.
Bob sits up. Dirt and rocks slide off him. His face looks

like it may never wash clean. He tries to say something but:
Suddenly a big WHISTLE BLOWS.

INT. MAIN OFFICE -- DAY

BOB stands in a long ambling line with other FILTHY MINERS.
He reaches the TIME CLOCK, inserts his CARD, and PUNCHES out.

INT. SEEDY BAR -- NIGHT
A grungy television displays today’s WINNING LOTTERY NUMBERS.

The BARTENDER begins to channel surf. We catch a glimpse of
a bizarre alien SPACESHIP. A COMMERCIAL asks, “Looking for
adventure?” A handsome NEWS ANCHOR says, “Scientists still
cannot explain--” A SMILING MAN surrounded by MONEY adds, “I
went to outer space and all I brought back was a FORTUNE.”

An EXCITABLE CROWD chants a word we hear for the first time--

“HEECHEE!”

BOB sits on his usual stool and stares into the broken mirror
behind the bar, his EMPTY BEER BOTTLES speedily accumulating.

TWO MINERS step up to the bar next to Bob and catch the BREWS
sliding their way. They raise the bottles...but then notice:

MINER #1
You all right, Bob?

MINER #2
Of course he’s all right. That
is Bob Broadhead you’re talkin’
about!

MINER #1
Then why does he look like that?

MINER #2
Like what?

MINER #1
All contemplative like...

In unison they look in the mirror and study Bob’s expression.

MINER #2
That is not a contemplating face.

MINER #1
The hell it isn’t.
MINER #2
When have you ever contemplated
anything?
MINER #1
Plenty o’ times.
MINER #2
Uh-huh.
MINER #1

Ten bucks says Bob is in an
advanced state of contemplation
right now.

MINER #2
You’re on.

They wait for him to speak... and wait. Bob clutches a beer,
obviously intoxicated, studying his reflection. Now he looks
ready to say something. His friends lean close, and finally:

BOB
Started working the food mines
at half-pay, age twelve...

The first miner smiles wide. The loser reaches deep inside
his pocket, and hands over his oily crumpled ten dollar BILL.

BOB (CONT’D)
By the time I was sixteen, had
my rating: charge driver.

MINER #1
Your folks would be real proud
of you, Bob. That’s hard work,
and good pay--

BOB
Yeah. Good pay... but what do
you do with it?

MINER #2
What do you mean, Bob?

BOB
It’s not enough to get you out.

MINER #1
Out of what?

Their FOREMAN steps up to the bar, the soot on his face by
now a permanent feature. He doesn’t seem to like Bob much.
Clearly, the feeling’s mutual:
FOREMAN
Griping, Broadhead?

BOB
Drinkin’.

FOREMAN
Close call today--

BOB
Think so?

FOREMAN

Your charges were too close.

BOB
My charges were fine. We're
drillin’ too deep, too fast.

FOREMAN
Oh is that right? Maybe you
oughta file a complaint with
management.

Bob finds that funny, and LAUGHS in his beer. The foreman
isn’t amused. He moves close:

FOREMAN

I can tell your future, Bob.
One day, maybe real soon,
your luck will run out, and
you'll find yourself under a
couple tons o’ loose shale.
Oh...we’ll get you out. We
don’t leave our people. of
course, it may take a while.

The two miners closest to Bob are beginning to look worried,
expecting the worst. Everybody within earshot is listening--

FOREMAN (CONT'D)
I reckon you know all about
waitin’. How long was your
daddy trapped in that cave-in?
Must be hard on a kid. Is
it true what they say, after
a man’s been buried more than
three days, he’s just not
good for anything anymore--

Bob turns on the foreman and lands an old-fashioned PUNCH
that drops him to the floor.

You could hear a pin drop. Bob stares down at his limp body.
BOB
Drinks on me.

Everybody CHEERS. MALE AND FEMALE MINERS rush the bar for
their free drinks, while Bob makes his way toward the street.

His two friends share a worried look and follow close behind:

MINER #1
You can’t just punch out
the boss, Bob.

BOB
Too late...

MINER #2
All of this contemplation
is messin’ with the inner-
workings of your brain!

Bob stops at the screen door. He stares out at the night and

BOB
I have never seen things
more clearly, boys. For
the first time in my life,
I can decide for myself.

MINER #1
Decide what, Bob?

Bob turns around and looks at them, with such an expression,
they have to know this is the last time they’1l ever see him.

BOB
Who I want to be tomorrow.

And Bob pushes out the door.

EXT. RURAL ROAD -- NIGHT

BOB walks away from the place, unsteady at first, but quickly
picking up the pace. SOUNDS OF THE BAR fade. Bob reaches
the road and keeps on going.

EXT. RECRUITMENT OFFICE -- NIGHT
A tired BOB leaves the long stretch of pavement for a small

building plastered with POSTERS that read: “Join the Star
Rush,” “Find the Lost Alien Race” and “Plunder the Universe!”
7.

Nevertheless Bob stares at one sign in particular: “CLOSED.”

That settles it. His legs give out from under him, and Bob
falls face down in the dirt...

DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. RECRUITMENT OFFICE -- LATER

The sun is rising in the sky. BOB hasn’t moved an inch,
still lying on the ground, when a VEHICLE pulls up to the
building and parks. We hear the sound of a CAR DOOR opening.

A PAIR OF LEGS walks across the dirt and gravel right past
Bob, not even hesitating. We hear the sound of KEYS, the
FRONT DOOR swinging open, and a second later it BANGING SHUT.

Moments pass. Bob lies there.

The DOOR opens again. The same FOOTSTEPS cross gravel. Now
THE LEGS return, and stand by Bob. We never do see his face:

RECRUITMENT GUY
(bored, by rote)

Earth not doin’ right by you?
Hope the stars will treat you
better? If you answer yes to
the above, then fame, fortune,
and adventure can be yours--
Go and search the cosmos for
fantastic discoveries that defy
imagination, priceless objects
older than humanity, and maybe
even find an alien or two....

Bob doesn’t move an inch. Is he even awake? We don’t know--

RECRUITMENT GUY
Passage off planet ain’t cheap.

Bob moves his arm and only his arm, searching around in his
pocket, and finally coming up with one simple LOTTERY TICKET.

The ticket is FLASHING repeatedly: “WINNER! WINNER! WINNER!”
The man accepts the ticket. A second later, he reaches back
down for Bob’s thumb, pressing the digit against a small
HANDHELD DEVICE. It BEEPS and

RECRUITMENT GUY
The human race thanks you.

The legs leave. We hear the sound of FOOTSTEPS on gravel.
The door re-opens and BANGS SHUT. Bob just lies in the dirt.
BOB
(muffled)
You’re welcome.

cur TO:
EXT. TRANSPORT SHIP -- SPACE
The next generation of EARTH SHUTTLE crosses a sea of stars--
cur TO:
INT. TRANSPORT SHIP -- SPACE

BOB and the other NEW ARRIVALS lie strapped side-by-side in
zero-gravity WEBBING. The passenger cabin is crammed full,
everyone packed in tight; and unfortunately for Bob, he is
stuck next to a woman named SHERI, who never stops talking...

SHERI
Are you scared? Not me, I mean,
I know why I should be scared:
We’re going to climb into space-
ships built by aliens before we
were born -- before anyone was
born -- strap ourselves in, and
hit “go.” We’ll travel faster
than light, we don’t know how...
We don’t know how long we’1ll be
gone, even if we knew where we
were going, which we don’t. So
we could travel our whole lives
and die before we get there, or
run into something that will
kill us in two seconds-- Right?
Right.

(short pause)

Are you scared?

Bob watches a uniformed CREW MEMBER float past directly above
them, moving smoothly through the cabin. He grins knowingly:

CREW MEMBER
Docking in 5 minutes. Welcome
to Gateway!

EXT. ASTEROID -- SPACE

The shuttle approaches a large ASTEROID. It looks lumpy,
charred, and pockmarked with craters. An ancient space rock.
But the craters on this asteroid berth STARSHIPS.
9.

We see only the nose of the ships as the great rock rotates,
giving us a long look at what’s become our “gateway” to the
stars...

curt TO:
INT. LARGE DOCK -- DAY

BOB and the other NEW ARRIVALS walk a narrow lane formed by
two ROWS OF SHIPS, charred and battered like ancient relics,
but somehow still beautiful. The exotic lines of the alien
design defy normal Earthly expectations of space or rocketry.

Bob can’t take his eyes off the ships. Up ahead, SECURITY
PERSONNEL are tossing INFORMATION PACKETS the size of several
phone books into the waiting arms of the awestruck newcomers.

Assistant Director EMMA FOTHER steps out onto a small BALCONY
and addresses the group. Unlike most of the others on this
asteroid, Emma is always well-groomed and impeccably dressed:

EMMA

“Welcome aboard.”

(short pause)
That was a joke, but you won’t
understand it for some time...
The information packet you are
being given contains your room
assignment; a daily per-capita
tax assessment for the air you
are already breathing; and a
copy of your contract granting
the Gateway Corporation sole
authority in the exploitation,
sale, and lease of any and all
discoveries you make during
your missions into outer space.

Bob moves forward, catches the packet tossed his way, and
immediately looks around for something. He seems to find it.

EMMA (CONT'D)
It is vital that you do not
lose your information packet--

Emma sees Bob throw his information packet INTO A GARBAGE
CAN. She stops talking. Bob senses he was observed, looks
up, and locks eyes with Emma. Clearly she hates him already.

Bob looks back at the starships one last time, then walks on.
10.

INT. MAZE OF TUNNELS -- DAY

BOB steps into a maze of tunnels constructed from a strange,
luminescent alien metal that emits its own light. These
passages wind crazily through the rock and are always CROWDED
with prospectors, security guards, and maintenance personnel.

He reads the CARD with his room number, scans a colorful MAP
on the wall, and starts off--

But Bob doesn’t go unnoticed. DANE METCHNIKOV is small and
rodent-like. He locks onto Bob and scurries up beside him,
even creepier when he smiles:

DANE
Greetings, friend!

Bob glances down at him. Says nothing at all. Keeps moving.

DANE (CONT'D)
Name’s Dane Metchnikov, guide
and financial advisor, 1-stop
shop for off-Earth contraband,
trustworthy confidant and all-
around orientation specialist.

(short pause)

If you’1ll follow me this way,
I’1l be happy to--

Bob heads in the other direction and Dane looks disappointed.

DANE
--or that way, sure.

Bob and Dane pass a SCREEN playing images of Gateway. A
soothing female voice offers:

VOICE OF GATEWAY
Gateway is an artifact created
by the ancient Heechee race. It
was formed around an asteroid or
the core of an atypical comet--

The NEXT SCREEN they pass by is giving the same presentation.
VOICE OF GATEWAY
The time of its creation is not
known, but almost surely precedes
the rise of human civilization!

Bob keeps moving down the tunnel. Dane struggles to keep up.
11.

DANE
I’ve helped a lot of new fish
-..no offense...transition to
life on a hunk o’ space rock.

BOB
Don’t need your help. I
spent most of my days in
tunnels just like--

An UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT enters the tunnel. It looks
like a metal ball with little folded bug arms. The thing
speeds through the corridor. Everybody ducks out of the way.

It whizzes between Bob and Dane, and darts around the corner.

BOB (CONT’D)
The hell was that?

DANE
Now this is exactly what I am
talkin’ about. For a small
retainer, a token fee, I can be
available to answer questions
such as, “the hell was that?”

Bob grabs Dane by the shirt and pulls him close. Scares him.

BOB
How about you answer for free?

DANE
Sure, you want to sample the
product before buying-- I
understand completely. That
is just good business sense!

BOB
(again, stronger)
The hell was that?

DANE
I don’t know--

Bob starts down the tunnel. Dane follows, trying to explain:

DANE (CONT'D)
Nobody knows!

BOB
What do you mean nobody knows?
12.

DANE

The aliens left it. It just
flies around, and as far as

anybody can tell, doesn’t do
anything-- You can’t catch
it, and it never stops. My

own personal theory is, it’s
an air freshener.

BOB
The air stinks--

Bob steps inside a bizarre ELEVATOR. Dane squeezes in, fast.

DANE
How do you know, maybe that’s
the smell o’ Heechee flowers?

INT. WEIRD ELEVATOR -- DAY

BOB and DANE huddle inside a claustrophobic elevator never
meant to carry occupants the size and shape of human beings--

Dane stares up at Bob, expectantly. If he had a tail, he’d
be wagging it. Finally Bob gives in. He reaches into his
pocket and takes out a TWENTY.

Dane grabs the bill fast, crumples it, pulls it, and holds it
up to the light while he says:

DANE

Everyone who comes to Gateway
gets ten days’ worth of food,
lodging, and air -- courtesy
of the Gateway Corporation --
plus an invitation to sign up
for the next spaceship out.

You don’t have to sign up for
the next prospecting trip, or
any trip at all. If you lose
your nerve, you can stay here
until your money runs out...

The elevator doors slide OPEN.

Immediately Bob hears SCREAMS. SECURITY GUARDS are dragging
a STRUGGLING MAN toward an open AIRLOCK. They throw him in--

One of the guards hits a switch, the thick airlock door
slides shut, and a moment later we see the terrified man at
the small window, POUNDING on the glass and YELLING for help.
13.

Bob watches the scene intensely, hardened enough by life that
death doesn’t shock him, but even this takes getting used to:

BOB

(dryly)
Looks like his money ran out.

The outer hatch BLOWS OPEN and the man is suddenly PULLED
FROM THE WINDOW -- as if by an invisible hand -- just a blur.

Through the porthole we briefly glimpse the man’s unprotected
body HURLING TOWARD THE STARS.

Dane squeezes closer making room for OTHERS trying to get on.

DANE
You go bust, you take the
next shuttle home. Try to
run...you get the airlock.

The elevator slides SHUT. It really is very cramped in here.

Dane stands next to a HEAVY-SET NURSE transporting a high-
tech BIOLOGICAL CONTAINER. About the size of a large bucket.

A SCREEN in the elevator displays the Gateway CORPORATE LOGO:

VOICE OF GATEWAY
Gateway is proud to announce
the return of mission 24-331
..-another successful voyage
into the unknown!

DANE
That means the ship returned.
It doesn’t say anything about
the condition of the crew.

BOB
What happened to the crew?

NURSE
(gruffly)
You’re lookin’ at ‘em.

The elevator OPENS and the nurse EXITS carrying her medical
bucket. Bob watches her go. Slowly the doors begin to shut.

DANE
“Successful” is defined kind
of loosely around here--

curt TO:
14.

INT. MAZE OF TUNNELS -- DAY

The elevator OPENS on a different level. BOB starts down the
tunnel and scans the room numbers, with DANE right alongside.

DANE
They probably dropped out of
warp too close to a sun, or a
supernova. Best not to think
about it. Besides, I’ve been
out three times, and look at
me: sound of mind and body!

BOB
Uh-huh.

They pass several more SCREENS with ACTORS SIGNING DOCUMENTS:

VOICE OF GATEWAY
Upon your arrival on Gateway,
remember to read and sign
your Memorandum of Agreement--

Now the same actors in SPACESUITS are finding fake-looking
ARTIFACTS on a staged planet.

VOICE OF GATEWAY
--releasing all rights in and
to any discoveries, artifacts,
and objects of value you find
during exploration--

The actors hand them over to COMPANY OFFICIALS, shake hands,
and receive OVERSIZED CHECKS.

VOICE OF GATEWAY
--to the Gateway Authority!

They find a door. Bob stops.

DANE
Guys like you and me? We
feed off danger. I’m just
biding my time waitin’ for
the right mission to come
along, eyes on the big score,
you know? I’11 leave here
a wealthy man.

BOB
If you say so.

There is a DEAFENING BLAST, and the tunnel lurches, as if the
15.

asteroid is breaking apart....

DANE
That was--
BOB
(realizing)

--a ship taking off.

DANE
Yeah, you'll feel that a lot.

Bob moves toward his room, and the door opens automatically.

DANE
You reckon maybe I should
wait outside your door a while
in case you need me--

Bob shoves another BILL into Dane’s hand, and walks into the
room. The door slides shut. A happy Dane examines his cash.

DANE (CONT'D)
Can’t stay, very busy, gotta
run!

INT. BOB’S QUARTERS -- DAY

BOB stands inside of his room. Literally, standing in place
is all he can do. Bob’s room is the SIZE OF A SMALL CLOSET--

There is a sleeping bag hanging on the wall, assuming he can
fall asleep vertically. A miniscule sink and a funny toilet
that retracts. Hooks and slots for his things. He has about
six inches of wiggle room between his shoulders and the wall.

A tiny private SCREEN BLIPS ON with a close-up of an EYEBALL.

VOICE OF GATEWAY
Gateway not what you expected?
Experiencing feelings of profound
regret? Let the Sigfrid-1000
Automated Psycho-analyst help!

For the first time we see Bob smile, and LAUGH. Something
tells us he has never looked this happy in his entire life...

BOB
No thanks, darlin’. I’m good.
I’m real good.
16.

INT. “THE BLUE HELL” -- NIGHT

Ragged-looking PROSPECTORS guzzle down cheap BOOZE at the

long bar. Space-adapted gaming tables showcase POKER, a slow-
moving ROULETTE with a big dense ball, and CRAPS with dice
that take forever to stop. A dozen DIFFERENT LANGUAGES can
be heard mixed together--English, Russian, Chinese, Spanish--
and everyone talks animatedly, as if trying to be understood.

BOB walks through the swinging doors, as if stepping into the
wild west. He looks around.

MALE VOICE
And now, my dear friends and
fools, let us speak of bigger
rewards -- and of a bonus the
company never expects to pay.

Bob wants to hear this and squeezes through the crowd to see:

PROFESSOR HEGRAMET sits at a table holding a BEER, surrounded
by his REGULAR AUDIENCE of half-drunk/half-alert prospectors.

PROFESSOR
Five hundred million dollars
for that lucky man or woman
who finds a living Heechee--

Everyone gathered around BLURTS a positive guttural response.

PROFESSOR
You! Answer me this. What
did the Heechee look like?

MALE PROSPECTOR
Beats me.

PROFESSOR
Of course it does -- because
we’ve never found anything
resembling a photograph or a
drawing. Now tell me: Did
they have some system for
storing knowledge? Did they
have books? Did they write?

FEMALE PROSPECTOR
Yeah?

PROFESSOR
Surely, they must have. What
that system was, we simply
don’t know. Now tell me, what
is the biggest mystery of all?
17.

Everybody stands there, perplexed, hiding behind their beers.
Bob isn’t one to speak up, but something about this gets him:

BOB
The Heechee didn’t die here--

The Professor finds Bob and looks him over. Seems surprised.

PROFESSOR
And why not?

BOB
Because if they did, we’d find
their bones...or whatever they
had instead of bones.

PROFESSOR
A worthy observation. Go on.

BOB
If they didn’t die, then they
left. So I guess the big
mystery is, why did the Heechee
leave all this for us to find
...and where did they go?

PROFESSOR
Brilliant. That is the very
question which compelled me
to leave the confines of the
classroom and venture out to
the wilds of Gateway itself!

The Professor takes a drink. Everyone stands around waiting
for him to continue, but he never does, and finally Bob asks:

BOB
So where are they?

PROFESSOR
My dear fellow, it beats the
piss out of me.

He sets his head face down on the table. Class dismissed...
Everyone disperses. Bob looks like he should have known
better. He makes his way to the bar and takes an open stool.

A group of DRUNKEN PROSPECTORS lift up their bottles in song:

DRUNKS
We get squashed, burned, and
shredded to bits -- we don’t
care which -- little lost
Heechee start making us rich!
18.

The BARTENDER slides a BEER to Bob. He nods thanks and
raises the bottle to his lips when he is shoved from behind--

Bob turns and sees an ENORMOUS MAN standing behind him. The
giant has a problem with Bob.

BARTENDER
You’re sittin’ in his seat.

Bob thinks about it. Doesn’t want any trouble. He starts to
leave -- and gets shoved again. The enormous man glares down
at Bob, but doesn’t say anything. Hell, maybe he can’t talk.

BARTENDER
He wants to make an example
of you to warn others.

The giant wraps his thick fingers around Bob’s beer, takes it
from him, and tosses the bottle over his shoulder. Bob
watches his beer sail away...

The bottle rises into the air, and just when you think it’s
going to fall back down, IT KEEPS RISING. The beer tumbles
end-over-end through the cave like it’s never coming back and

BOB
(surprised)
My beer--
The bartender SPITS into a dirty glass and casually explains.
BARTENDER
Right up there is the center
of the asteroid. The center
doesn’t spin.
The giant rolls up his sleeves, getting ready to pummel Bob--

BOB
No spin, no gravity, gotcha.

The enormous man lunges and misses. Bob evades the blow and
leaps onto a table, from the table onto the giant’s back,
LAUNCHING HIMSELF IN THE AIR.

Bob jumps high above the tavern floor...and never comes down.

Everyone in the bar looks up, sees him, and CHEERS WILDLY as
BOB RISES HIGHER AND HIGHER--

He floats through the cavern over the saloon, pleased with
himself and his great escape.

The enormous man watches Bob go, disappointed. He sits down.
19.
Gradually everybody returns to their drinks or to the games.
For Bob, realization sets in--

BOB
Uh-oh.

Bob drifts in the zero-gravity, STARTING TO SPIN a little,
unable to stop his slow tumble and with nothing to grab onto.

FEMALE VOICE
Looks like I got me a floater.

Bob looks around, the best he can. Where did that come from?

BOB
Who said that?

FEMALE VOICE
I did.

Out of the deep dark shadows of the cavern, a figure emerges:

KLARA MOYNLIN is a strong-faced woman, her hair pulled back
tight, sailing through the air.

KLARA
Relax your body.

BOB
What--

KLARA SLAMS INTO BOB and knocks the wind out of him. They
fly through the core together, one of her arms wrapped around
him, the other extended out in front of her like a lifeguard.

Bob recovers. Holds her tight.

KLARA
Have you ever been with a
woman?

BOB
Uh-huh--

KLARA

Then there’s no reason to
hold on so tight.

BOB
Sorry.
(short pause)
I don’t want you to think
this is a rescue.
20.

KLARA
Did you have a plan
for getting down when you
jumped up here?

BOB
Not exactly.

KLARA
Then it’s a rescue.

Bob turns his head, surprised but pleased to see his BEER
FLOATING BY, sailing off in the other direction. He reaches
out and snatches the bottle.

KLARA
You should begin to feel a
pull toward the ground--

Suddenly Bob and Klara LAND HARD ON THE FLOOR of the tavern.
Bob takes the brunt of the impact, with Klara lying on top of
him. They are surrounded by FEET scurrying out of their way.

Bob raises the bottle in his hand, and offers Klara the beer:

BOB
(still in pain)
How about a drink?

Klara looks at the beer, like where the hell did he get that?
Then she smiles a little, grabs the bottle, and twists off
the cap. Still sitting astride Bob, she takes a long drink--

Bob watches her, clearly impressed. She hands the beer back.

KLARA
See you around.

BOB
Hold on. What’s your name?

KLARA
Klara.

Bob wants to tell Klara his name, but he can’t get a word in:

KLARA (CONT'D)

Your name is Tom, or Johnny,

or Bill. You grew up in the

middle of nowhere and worked

in a factory. Or was it a

farm, or a mine? It doesn’t
(CONT'D)
21.

KLARA (CONT'D)
matter-- From the time you
were a little boy you dreamed
about running away from that
godforsaken town. Then one
day somebody died and left
you better off, or you robbed
a bank. Suddenly you had more
money than you could drink
away with the guys or blow on
the same old girls. And so
you bought a one-way ticket
to Gateway... the only place
in the universe guaranteed
worse than the one you left--
(short pause)
How am I doing?

Bob looks at Klara. Every word just makes him like her more.
BOB

(finding one fault)
My name is Bob.

KLARA
I don’t want to know you,
Bob.

BOB
Why not?

KLARA

People around here tend
not to live long--

She starts to get off, but Bob takes her by the arms. There
is something about him, a confidence, a spirit, that attracts
Klara despite her best effort:

BOB
Don’t I get a last wish?

curt TO:
INT. MACKLEN MEMORIAL -- NIGHT

BOB and KLARA stumble into a cave drinking BEERS, LAUGHING
and holding each other, already well into their intoxication.

The floor is COVERED IN PLEXIGLASS to protect the message
roughly scratched in the rock: “SYLVESTER MACKLEN WAS HERE.”

Their movements trigger a series of motion-activated SCREENS.
22.

VOICE OF GATEWAY
Gateway was discovered by
Sylvester Macklen, a tunnel
rat on Venus, who found an
operable Heechee spacecraft
in a dig, and got inside--

A hokey dramatization labeled “RE-ENACTMENT” shows Sylvester
Macklen’s final moments. A square-jawed actor LIGHTS A MATCH
and heroically tosses the flame at his overturned FUEL TANKS.

VOICE OF GATEWAY
Unable to return to Earth
--and without food or water--
Macklen signaled the exact
location of Gateway by
cleverly blowing himself up!

Bob gets interested in the show, and we hear the EXPLOSION,
but Klara pulls him toward a display ROPED OFF from the rest.

On the other side of the rope is an old, dusty HEECHEE SHIP.
VOICE OF GATEWAY
The Heechee vessel you see
here is the actual ship Macklen
used to travel to Gateway!
Klara unhooks the rope, but not before Bob trips and falls--

KLARA
Shhhhh!

They sneak to the ship, trying to be quiet. Klara struggles
with the HATCH until it gives... and they tumble in LAUGHING.

INT. HEECHEE SHIP -- NIGHT

BOB descends a strange-looking ladder into the main cabin and
immediately sets his eyes on the weird HEECHEE CONTROL PANEL.

A single V-SHAPED SEAT sits before an array of WHEELS and
SPOKES, LIGHTS and SWITCHES, a SPIRAL COIL and a diamond-
shaped BLACK BOX. The control panel looks both ancient AND
cutting-edge futuristic -- a uniquely disturbing combination.

Seeing that control panel goes a long way in sobering Bob up.

KLARA (0.S.)
Having fun yet?
23.

Bob turns as an upside-down KLARA pokes her head through the
ceiling. She disappears a second then drops down feet first.

Klara sips from her beer BOTTLE as she talks, clearly tipsy,
but still commanding attention:

KLARA
You see that vertical line of
wheels with the little spokes
sticking out of them? That’s
the only thing on the control
panel you can touch. Toilet
is over there. You’ll have a
lot of fun with that, but it
works... You can sling your
hammock and sleep here. That
funny black box is the brain
of the whole ship, but nobody
knows what’s inside-- Don’t
ever get curious or bored and
try to open it.

BOB
Why not?

KLARA
Because every time somebody
does, it explodes.

Bob sits in the weird seat and looks uncomfortable, like it
just doesn’t fit his behind--

BOB
What kind of asses did these
Heechee have?

KLARA
That’s another mystery.

Klara takes Bob’s hand and places it on one of those wheels.
But then she doesn’t remove her hand from his. Bob looks
pleased, but surprised. Klara leans over his shoulder close:

KLARA
Don’t worry, no one’s ever
been able to get this ship
off the ground--now try to
turn the wheel.

Slowly they turn the strange alien wheel together. The panel
dimly LIGHTS UP. It HUMS, gently. Bob and Klara both smile,
enjoying the close proximity.
BOB
What’s next?
24.

KLARA
The wild blue yonder.

BOB
And there’s no way to tell
where you’re going?

KLARA
Probably, if you’re a Hee-
chee pilot a million years
ago with training. All us
human beings have to wait
until the bus stops...then
look out the window.

BOB
This is a really great date.

Klara smiles and sits on his lap. Bob pulls her close, and
they kiss, in no real hurry to separate their lips. When
they do, Klara grows serious.

KLARA
You just need to be brave
for a second. One second
while they shut the hatch.

BOB
How many times have you--

Klara dangles the half-dozen clinking BRACELETS on her wrist.

KLARA
One for each trip. Never
scored big, but I did
alright. Tomorrow I cash
in and sail back to Earth.

BOB
Why?

KLARA
Because, as hard as I try,
I just can’t find that one
second of courage anymore.

BOB
Before I came here, all I
did was survive. I just...
lived. I need more than
that, Klara... don’t you?

Klara looks like she just doesn’t know the answer any longer.
25.

Suddenly the asteroid is violently ROCKED by a large impact.
They hold one another to keep from falling, and ALARMS sound:

BOB
That was no take-off--

KLARA
It was a landing!

Klara gets up and runs for the ladder. Quickly, Bob follows.

INT. DOCKING BAY -- NIGHT

WATER IS SPRAYING from the walls and ceiling hitting
something very hot. BOB and KLARA make their way through the
STEAM. Now the eerie shape of a CRASHED SHIP begins to form.

Bob and Klara are soaked from the jets. They wipe their eyes
and try to see. Find a HATCH.

Bob moves to touch it but can’t. The metal is still too hot.

He looks around. Bob runs to a box and BREAKS THE GLASS.
Pulls out a strange METAL ROD.

Bob and Klara slip the rod into a SOCKET on the surface of
the vessel and use all of their combined strength to turn it.
The hatch OPENS. They go in--

INT. CRASHED SHIP -- NIGHT

BOB and KLARA climb inside. The air is THICK WITH SMOKE, and
the interior demolished. They can’t see much, moving deeper:

KLARA
Hello! Can you hear me--
Is anybody alive?

INSANE VOICE
Go away!

Bob and Klara turn to the sound. A CRAZY MAN charges out of
the smoke, clothes filthy and torn, face hidden behind a wild
beard. He is aiming a BLASTER. Bob moves in front of Klara.

The man’s free hand is clenched, like he’s holding something.
Something he doesn’t want anybody else in the galaxy to see--
26.

CRAZY MAN
You can’t have it. I found
it, not you. It’s mine!

KLARA
We want to help you. Where’s
the rest of the crew?

CRAZY MAN
I don’t know-- Still on the
planet? They should be here
already... late, very late--

Klara steps into the open. The man trains his weapon on her.
KLARA
You don’t need the blaster.

You’re home now.

CRAZY MAN
Stay away from me!

He looks around, suddenly worried. Bob is gone. LOST IN THE
SMOKE. The crazy man senses movement. Sees Bob behind him--

Bob knocks the gun from his hand, and gets a grip on the man.
CRAZY MAN
I found them. The aliens--
I’l1l cut you in, fella, fifty-
fifty. They gave me a map!

Bob looks down as the man raises his clenched fist and slowly
opens his fingers to reveal...nothing at all. An empty palm.

The crazy man looks down at his hand, as if it holds a great
treasure, LAUGHING insanely.

Bob just lets him go. The crazy man backs away from them and

He is abruptly STRUCK by a tazer weapon. His body stiffens
and shakes, for one horrible second, then drops to the floor.

AN ARMED SECURITY TEAM wearing biological CONTAINMENT SUITS

takes control of the scene, laying gloved hands on Bob and
Klara, and pulling them out.

INT. THE CORRIDOR -- NIGHT

BOB and KLARA rest against the rocky wall watching EMERGENCY
CREWS run past. Klara leans toward Bob. He pulls her close.
27.

They stay like that a while.

BOB
Let’s ship out. Tonight.

Klara takes a second, like she couldn’t have heard Bob right.
Now she pulls away from him.

BOB
You just need to be brave
for a second. One second
while they shut the hatch.

And Bob holds out his hand--

BOB (CONT’D)
Hell, I can hold your hand
that long.

Klara takes a step back, and another, and another. Finally
she turns and runs away down the tunnel. Bob watches her go.

curt TO:
INT. TOWARD A DOOR -- DAY

An ODD LITTLE MAN wearing a pair of STRAP-ON WINGS glides
down the passage, really flying. Shikitei Bakin has NO LEGS.

But he does have a BROOM. Strange reflective SHARDS OF ALIEN
METAL litter the floor of the tunnel. Shiky’s mechanized
wings flutter as he works, sweeping the junk up into a pile--

BOB rounds a corner determined to get somewhere. Shiky stops
working and flies along too:

SHIKY
This is your big day, stranger.
You are going to see the launch
captain-- Going to blast off?

Bob looks Shiky over but never stops moving toward the LARGE
DOOR at the end of the hall.

SHIKY (CONT’D)
Ah...you have noticed my wings.
Ran into a radiation storm on
my last trip. Emergency hatch
slammed shut while I was climb-
ing back inside the ship. If
you see a pair of legs floating
near the Orion Nebula, please
tell them Shiky says hello....
28.

BOB
I’1l do that.

SHIKY
They say, Shiky, just go home.
On Earth I’d be disabled...but
up here, in the low gravity, I
am a beautiful butterfly, yes?

Bob can’t help but like him.

SHIKY (CONT’D)
If you need an extra hand, it
is true I would not be of much
use in a lander. But in orbit,
I am as good as anyone, maybe
better. If you need an extra
crewman, you will think of me?

Bob stops at the end of the tunnel. He looks up at Shiky and
nods a little, ready to go in. Bob pushes through the door--

INT. LAUNCH FLOOR -- DAY

Take the trading floor of the New York Stock Exchange, add
the blinking lights and neon of Las Vegas, transport it to a
cavern made by ancient aliens...and you get the launch floor.

The grizzled LAUNCH CAPTAIN stands atop his elevated platform
gesturing down at the SCREAMING PROSPECTORS trying to get his
attention. Huge colorful screens run lists of OPEN MISSIONS.

BOB feels the excitement immediately. Walks onto the floor--

The launch captain checks the next CARD in his hand, and
yells like a carnival barker:

LAUNCH CAPTAIN
I’ve got a THREE here, folks,
a THREE, returned twice with
its crew alive, more or less.
Who feels lucky today?

The crowd storms the dais and

SHERI spots Bob in the throng and looks him over, remembering
him from the trip up here, and clearly, liking what she sees.

SHERI
Hi, Bob. Remember me? It’s
Sheri...
29.

Bob remembers her all right. She has to talk over the noise.

SHERI
I’m taking a five. It leaves
first thing in the morning...
I’ve got Willa, Jay and Barry.

Sheri lays a hand on his chest, her interest in him obvious--

SHERI (CONT’D)

It could be a long trip. I
want the last crew member to
be someone I’m...compatible
with, if you get my meaning?

Bob catches a glimpse of KLARA across the room. Or does he?

BOB
(distracted)
Thanks, I’11 think about it--

More people block his view, and when they pass Klara is GONE,
if she was ever there at all.

Bob walks on and Sheri watches him go, disappointed for a
second. But then she spots someone else, and checks him out.

SHERI
Hey, big fella...

LAUNCH CAPTAIN (0.S.)
Conner, Fitz, and Yakamora!

He straightens up, reads the next CARD in his hand, and says:

LAUNCH CAPTAIN
Next up is a ONE-- That’s
right, a ONE...little or no
chance of coming back alive
...-perfect for the crazed
and/or suicidal!

Even this crowd of filthy downtrodden prospectors won't bite.
LAUNCH CAPTAIN
(feigning surprise)
Come on now, people... you
want to live forever?

Bob moves toward the platform, still keeping a look out for
Klara, then finally shrugs it off to his eyes playing tricks.

He waits for the next launch.
30.

ANOTHER PROSPECTOR steps up beside Bob and watches the
screens. He is skinny, his clothes soiled. On his last leg.

PROSPECTOR
(nervous )
I want that three, you see
it up there?

Bob looks at the man. Then up at the board. Sees the entry.

PROSPECTOR (CONT’D)
It’s armored. Gotta be safe
if it’s covered with armor,
right? Gotta be... What do
you say, mister?

BOB
I say, any ship covered in
armor ain’t goin’ anyplace
I want to go.

And Bob steps closer to the dais, leaving the prospector to
think about it, his eyes wide, like jesus, he saved my life--

Out in the center of the floor, the launch captain continues:

LAUNCH CAPTAIN
I’ve got a FIVE-- Untested
ship with a destination god
knows where... experienced
lander pilot if you’re lucky
enough to find a planet, and
four--count ‘em, four--spots
still available... You want
to gamble big, and win big?
This is the mission for you.

Bob listens to his speech. Checks the board. Has a feeling.

The prospectors rush forward YELLING for the launch captain’s
attention, hands in the air, with Bob right in among them and

LAUNCH CAPTAIN
(over the noise)
Cahill, first spot is yours!

Bob pushes and SHOUTS with the best of them, but there are so
many, he’s lost in the crowd--

LAUNCH CAPTAIN
You! What’s your name again?
Frauenglass, congratulations.
Take your pal, Tayeh.
31.

He searches the throng trying to make his final decision,
everyone waving and yelling...

LAUNCH CAPTAIN (CONT’D)
I need one more. Come on,
talk to me, who wants it?!
Everybody tries to push closer to the dais. A FIGHT BREAKS
OUT. Bob yells with the best of them, but it does no good.
The launch captain passes over him, turning his back to Bob--
So it’s all the more surprising when he spins around yelling:

LAUNCH CAPTAIN
BROADHEAD!

Bob is pleased, but dumbfounded. The launch captain nods to
somebody on the floor. We find KLARA standing and watching--

KLARA
Nice going, Broadhead. I
hear that ship has a good
pilot.
They walk together and leave the desperate, struggling crowd.

BOB
So when do we leave?

KLARA
Countdown starts in T-minus
thirty minutes, and you’re
going to do a hell of a lot
more than hold my hand....
cur TO:
White letters and numbers PRINT quickly across a dark screen.
MISSION 29-140
Vessel 331, Voyage 08D47, Crew S. Cahill, D. Frauenglass,
M. Tayeh, K. Moynlin, R. Broadhead
cur TO:
INT. HEECHEE SHIP -- SPACE
BOB and KLARA make out, like two teenagers in the back seat--

COUNTDOWN
...TEN...NINE...EIGHT...

We pull back. They are strapped inside WEBBING for lift-off.
32.

COUNTDOWN
...SEVEN...SIX...FIVE...

Bob and Klara kiss like people who might be dead in a second.

COUNTDOWN
...FOUR...THREE...TWO...

They pull apart and hold on.

COUNTDOWN
...ONE.

The acceleration suddenly, violently hits Bob and Klara, and
they are swallowed by their webbing to the roar of THRUSTERS.

curt TO:

BOB looks like he’s going to lose the contents of his stomach
in the next few seconds. KLARA turns to him sympathetically.

KLARA
Poor Bob. And we’re just
beginning.

Staring at the big control panel, SAM CAHILL cheerily offers:

SAM
Fluctuating G forces play
havoc with your stomach--

DRED FRAUENGLASS climbs the ladder into the cabin. Sees Bob.

DRED
Ham, if you don’t get out of
that bathroom, our situation
is going to become critical!

The bathroom opens and MOHAMMED TAYEH steps out. Bob lunges
across the cabin SLAMMING the door. Sam, Dred and Ham LAUGH.

cur TO:
BOB sits on the weird Heechee toilet. It’s a very tight fit.

BOB (V.0.)
This is Bob Broadhead’s log.
Company wants each of us to
keep a record of our voyage
so, for whatever it’s worth,
here’s mine. This ship has
never been out before....

(CONT'D)
33.

BOB (CONT’D)

That could be bad news for
us, since no one has done any
maintenance on these things
for hundreds of thousands of
years. We could end up with
a clunker. On the other hand,
it means we probably have a
full tank of gas, which is
good, since nobody knows what
the fuel is, or where to put
it, or how to tell when it’s
about to run out. Would it
have killed the Heechee to
leave a manual lying around?

curt TO:

BOB emerges from the bathroom. KLARA is the only one in the
cabin, checking out their equipment with a CLIPBOARD in hand.

KLARA
Looks like we’re going straight
toward Galactic North.

BOB
That good?

Klara turns to him, and grins.

KLARA
Who the hell knows?

curt TO:

At one time or another, EVERYONE in the crew stops to look at
that strange COIL on the control panel. They rest in their
HAMMOCKS, eat gloopy-looking MEALS, perform mundane house-
hold CHORES and try to pretend they aren’t watching the coil.

BOB (V.0.)

When the big coil flickers,
you’ve traveled half the
distance to wherever you’re
going. Multiply the number
of days you’ve been out by
four, and that’s your total
travel time. If it’s less
than the number of days of
life-support you have, then
at least you know you won’t
be starving or suffocating
to death...
34.

The crew plays POKER. They peek over the cards at that coil.

BOB (V.0.)

Our rations won’t support five
people for more than 300 days.
But they might support four, or
three, or two, or one... After
the 75-day mark most crews draw
straws, or cut the cards. The
loser crawls in the freezer and
hopes the docs back on Gateway
have gotten better at thawing
people out. They don’t mention
this on the recruiting poster.

curt TO:

BOB wraps his arms around KLARA, holding her close while she
sleeps. They are alone in the LANDING MODULE. The HATCH
opens fast and SAM calls down--

SAM
Get up here!

curt TO:

BOB and KLARA climb up into the main cabin. SAM, DRED, and
HAM are standing together...real TEARS OF JOY on their faces.

The coil is FLICKERING. All throughout the spiral of glass,
golden sparks chase each other.

Klara jumps into Bob’s arms and

BOB (V.0.)
The coil flickered...with
margin to spare. For now,
that’s good enough.

DISSOLVE TO:

BOB moves into view, tired and dirty. TIME HAS PASSED. The
ship makes strange SOUNDS, and suddenly, Bob begins to FLOAT.

He drifts awkwardly for a second, then finds a foothold and
pushes off. KLARA meets him in mid-flight. They can’t move
quickly enough. SAM, DRED, and HAM join them at a porthole--

BOB (V.0.)
A month later, I feel us
drop out of warp. And just
like Klara said, we look out
the window...
35.

EXT. A NEW PLANET -- SPACE

An enormous GAS-GIANT several times the size of our own
planet Jupiter blocks out the stars. The gigantic sphere is
made up of diagonal zones and belts of swirling colors,
storms large enough to engulf a hundred Earths. An elaborate
system of shimmering RINGS encircles the planet, and even
closer, there is a strange battered and hostile-looking MOON.

INT. HEECHEE SHIP -- SPACE

BOB stares out through the porthole. He doesn’t notice the
strangely disappointed expressions on the rest of the crew.
One-by-one KLARA, SAM, DRED, and HAM push away from the
porthole. Finally Bob realizes he’s alone, and turns around:

BOB
What’s wrong?

HAM
(losing it)
This whole trip’s a wash-out
-- that’s what’s wrong!

KLARA
We can’t land on a gas-giant.

Sam hovers at the man-made instrumentation. Takes a reading.

SAM

I read five more planets....
DRED

They’re too far away.
BOB

What about that moon?
SAM

(to Ham)

Check it out.

HAM
It doesn’t look good.

SAM
I don’t want your opinion--
(calming himself)
I want you to check it out.

Ham floats to a station. Works the controls. They all wait.
36.

HAM
Coded electromagnetic rad-
iation...negative.

DRED
Try anomalous time-variant
temperatures. Maybe some-
thing gets warmer when the
sun sets.

HAM
Negative. High albedo sur-
face metal...also negative.
What now, boss?

BOB
I’m sorry, who do you mean?

DRED
Oh shut up. Sam?

SAM
Klara is the lander pilot...
(short pause)
...it’s her call.

Everyone turns and looks at Klara. She stares at an IMAGE OF
THE MOON on the main display.

BOB
I say we take a look at the
far side of the moon. Maybe
there’s a whole Heechee city
waiting for us--

HAM
That’s brilliant...

SAM
We came a long way. I’m not
in a hurry to leave, are you?

Dred and Ham don’t look too optimistic, but signal agreement.
Now they all wait for Klara--

KLARA
Bob’s got a point.

SAM
Far side it is. Anyone have
anything inspiring to say?
Bob shares a look with Klara--
37.

BOB
Moon or bust?

INT. HEECHEE LANDER -- SPACE

BOB, KLARA, DRED, and HAM sit crammed together inside the
landing module, made even more claustrophobic by the bulky
SPACESUITS they wear. A few small portholes reveal the MOON.

KLARA
(into her mike)
Approaching terminus. Talk
to you later, Sam.
The response CRACKLES over the radio, broken up, almost gone:

SAM’S VOICE
Be careful out--

And the communication CUTS OFF.

KLARA
Keep your eyes open, boys...

EXT. ABOVE THE MOON -- SPACE

The garbage can-like Heechee LANDER glides above the far side
of this strange moon. The landscape is cratered , as you
might expect, but also badly fractured and strangely jumbled.

The crust of the moon CRACKS and a GIANT GEYSER of blue-gray
matter sprays out into space--

INT. HEECHEE LANDER -- SPACE

KLARA fights the strange controls as the GEYSER rises up in
front of them. BOB, DRED, and HAM react with startled looks.

HAM
This moon is geologically
active.

DRED
Ya think?

And then there’s a PING. Just a single ping. Everyone turns
and looks at a small man-made, even primitive-looking DEVICE.
38.

KLARA
Confirm that hit--

Bob is closest. He reaches a gloved hand. Presses a button.

BOB
Scanning again for Heechee
signatures.

Seconds tick by. Nothing happens. Then they hear it: PING.

KLARA
Son-of-a-bitch-- Somebody
find me a place to land...

EXT. ABOVE THE MOON -- SPACE

The Heechee LANDER DESCENDS to the surface. The GAS-GIANT

and its exotic formation of RINGS form a dramatic backdrop to
the DEEP CRATERS and JAGGED MOUNTAINS of this unwelcoming
hellhole. The landing struts kick up clouds of moon DUST and

INT. HEECHEE LANDER -- SPACE

BOB, DRED, and HAM are strapping BLASTERS and a few pieces of
SURVIVAL EQUIPMENT to their spacesuits. KLARA watches them--

KLARA
I’1l keep the engine running.

As soon as Dred and Ham turn around, Klara pulls Bob close.
She touches her helmet to his, so she can talk without the
com system and Bob can hear her real voice THROUGH THE GLASS.

KLARA (CONT'D)
Nothing fancy, one step at a
time, okay?
cur TO:
EXT. MOON’S SURFACE -- SPACE

BOB takes a step, and then another, and JUMPS ACROSS A CHASM
performing an enormous leap:

KLARA’S VOICE
(over the radio)
Bob...Bob...God-damn it, Bob!
39.

Bob lands with a smile and raises the SCANNER on his wrist.
He turns his body all around until he hears a familiar PING--

DRED and HAM catch up to Bob, fatigued, shooting angry looks.

KLARA’S VOICE
You should be right on top of
it now. Do you see anything?

BOB
Just rocks.

The radio CUTS OUT. The moon SHAKES. On the distant horizon
another enormous blue-gray GEYSER bursts out from the ground.

On the surface you can really appreciate the enormous size of
these things, rising up into space, blowing dust and debris
in graceful arcs for hundreds of kilometers. It is gorgeous!

DRED
Will you look at that?

And as Bob, Dred, and Ham gaze up at the arching cloud of
debris, they slowly realize it will COME DOWN ON TOP OF THEM.

HAM
Uh-oh.

All three scramble to find shelter. Bob hurries underneath a
rocky outcropping as the DEBRIS STORM HITS, deadly rocks of
all sizes striking the moon with great impact, raising more
dust. An impenetrable CLOUD. Finally, the barrage stops....

Bob peeks his head out. Steps into the cloud, but can’t see.

BOB
Where is everybody? I can’t
see a thing--

Up ahead a shape forms in the dust. Bob approaches it. He
sees one of the guys, either Dred or Ham, we can’t tell,
standing there with his back toward Bob. Bob walks up, with:

BOB (CONT’D)
That was close... You okay?

Now we see the HELMET VISOR IS BROKEN, shattered by a small
rock, the jagged opening giving us a clear view of DRED’S
FACE, his mouth open in a silent scream. He looks dry and
discolored. Almost PETRIFIED.

Bob stumbles backwards leaving Dred standing there upright in
his spacesuit, his arms reaching out, frozen, a grim statue--
40.

BOB
(into his mike)
Dead, he’s dead--

Bob’s scanner releases a PING. He looks at his wrist. The
thing is going crazy now, ping ping ping ping ping ping ping.

The dust below his feet starts to rotate and drain away, like
a bizarre WHIRLPOOL. Bob begins to SINK BENEATH THE SURFACE.

BOB
We found it, Klara! It’s
under the--

Bob is sucked into the moon. His helmet goes under, and then
there is only one of his hands, reaching up out of the ground
briefly before it too is GONE.

The ping ping ping fades away...until we hear nothing at all.

INT. TUNNELS -- MOON

BOB emerges from a hole in the ceiling and lands hard on the
floor of an underground complex. He rolls out of the PILLAR
OF SAND streaming down from the surface and gets to his feet.

BOB
Hello, is anybody reading
me? This is Bob, respond.

There is no answer. Just STATIC. He starts down the tunnel.

BOB (CONT’D)
I’m in some kind of under-
ground complex.

This place looks like it’s been slowly going to hell over the
last few hundred thousand years. The familiar HEECHEE METAL
IS CRACKED, and most passages are FILLING with sand and rock.

BOB
This tunnel was definitely
made by our missing aliens.
Same luminous metal--I can
see okay...

Suddenly a deep disturbing sound REVERBERATES THROUGH THE
COMPLEX, as if the walls are moaning, protesting their fate--

BOB (CONT'D)
..-but structural integrity
may be a problem.
41.

He starts down the tunnel. Passes an insane-looking room
that is totally empty, as if it was stripped of its contents.

Bob looks into another room, and another, all just as barren.

BOB
Looks like they stripped the
place clean before they left.

He turns around. It is DARKER here, more dirt coming in, and
Bob turns on his HELMET LIGHT:

The beam illuminates a HEECHEE SHIP, shockingly close in the
dark. Bob takes a step back--

It appears to be damaged. There is an OPEN PANEL on the hull
exposing the alien mechanisms within. Bob shines his light.

BOB
There’s a ship here. Some
obvious damage--

Bob starts to move and HIS FOOT HITS SOMETHING. He looks
down and sees an oddly-shaped METAL BOX resting on the floor.

Bob gets down on one knee. Studies it. He reaches for the
box. Before his gloved fingertips can make contact it OPENS.
Bob pulls back his hand, fast.

The interior of the box rises and fans out displaying over a
dozen STRANGE OBJECTS WITHIN--

Bob reaches for the closest. Gently lifts it out. One end
seems like a grip of sorts, although clearly not made for
human hands. The other end is bizarrely designed but looks
like it might fit around something, perhaps unlock something?

BOB
I’m holding a kind of weird
screwdriver in my hand. It
has a funny grip on one end,
and a doohickey-thing on the
other. Klara, are you get-
ting this? We just hit the
jackpot. How much will the
company pay out for a com-
plete set of alien tools...?
[LAUGHS.] And all because
some poor, unlucky Heechee
broke-down a million years--

Bob still has a smile on his face when he hears the loud
POUNDING, followed by a mechanized WHIR, and now a big KLANG.
42.

You might say it sounded like a Heechee fixing his spaceship.

Bob darts to his feet. He doesn’t know what to do with the
weird screwdriver in his hand. Quickly finds a POUCH for it.

Bob pulls out his BLASTER and

The noise is coming from the far side of the ship. He throws
his back against the wall and starts moving toward the sound,
holding his weapon at ready. The SWEAT pours down his face--

Bob shuts his eyes. Just BREATHES. Then charges forward and

There is nothing here. On the far side of the ship a LARGE
HOSE IS BANGING on the hull, a slow COLUMN OF SAND hitting
another exposed panel, and making all kinds of random SOUNDS.

Bob holsters his blaster. Heads back. He shakes his head,
like what was he thinking, as he reaches down for the tools--

His gloved hand finds nothing. Bob looks around, all around.
That Heechee toolbox is GONE.

BOB
(into his mike)
I’m not alone. I repeat, I
am NOT alone down here!

Suddenly Bob sees a DISTORTED SHADOW retreating down the
hall, and takes off after it.

The entire complex RUMBLES. Bob is thrown off his feet and
hits the wall hard. It hurts, but he stays upright. Sees
the CEILING CRACK releasing dirt and rock into the tunnel and

Bob maneuvers through the underground complex as it continues
to split open. Not easy in a spacesuit. He looks exhausted.

Bob runs around a corner, and stops in his tracks. For a
split-second his light seems to illuminate a STRANGE SHAPE
LOST IN A CLOUD OF THICK DUST, then the passage gives way and
there is nothing that can be seen but the moon POURING IN and

BOB
No--

Bob runs toward the cave-in. Thrusts his arms into the sand.
BOB (CONT’D)
I’1l get you out, hold on,
just hold on!

He tries to reach deeper and
43.

BOB (CONT’D)
(getting angry)

I don’t care what you are,

you’re not gonna die like

this, you hear me?

Bob finally touches something, because his whole body tenses,
like holy crap, it’s in there!

Bob steels himself and pulls--

BOB
I’ve got you... I’ve got
you!

Bob calls forth all of his remaining strength to pull the
Heechee to safety, his progress agonizingly slow...but soon
the DIRT BEGINS TO SHIFT, like something large is coming out.

Bob releases a pained YELL and

He keeps fighting. Almost there. We are so close to seeing
a living breathing Heechee and

The ceiling above him CRACKS--

Bob pulls one final time, and he must get whatever it is out
because he stumbles backwards, sprawling on the floor just as

The crack in the ceiling BURSTS. A WALL OF SAND AND ROCK
cuts him off from the Heechee, if that’s really what it was.
Bob has no choice but to run--

KLARA’S VOICE
(very weak)
...Bob...come in, Bob...
Please respond...

Bob opens his mouth to respond, and SOMETHING GRABS HIS
SHOULDER. He spins around and finds HAM staring back at him.

Ham doesn’t bother saying hello. Immediately he attaches a
small HOOK to Bob’s spacesuit.

BOB
No, wait--

HAM
Sorry. Klara says you’re
leaving now!

By the time Bob knows what’s happening, he is rising through
a SHAFT toward the surface and
44,

EXT. MOON’S SURFACE -- SPACE

BOB is lifted to the surface by a rickety-looking TRIPOD
hastily constructed over a hole-- It swings Bob away from
the opening, and roughly deposits him back onto solid ground.

KLARA’S VOICE
If we don’t get out of here
we’re going to be permanent
residents!

Since Bob went down all hell has broken loose. GEYSERS erupt
in the distance. SMALL POCKETS of pressure collect under the
surface until they burst releasing powerful COLUMNS OF STEAM.

Bob stands up. Looks around.

BOB’S P.O.V. Far in the distance the LANDER looks small and
frail, the GROUND CRACKING, beginning to collapse around it--

BOB
Get that ship off the moon.

HAM rises from the opening, and looks at Bob. Are you nuts?!

KLARA’S VOICE
I’m not leaving you behind.

BOB
We’ll never make it-- Ham
and I will rendezvous with
you in orbit.

HAM
How the hell are we going
to do that?!
Bob grows another crazy smile:
BOB
Don’t worry, I got an idea!
A really bad idea...
And he runs toward a small pocket of pressure building up
under the ground. The surface begins to CRACK. Bob leaps
over the fissure as it BURSTS.
BOB RIDES THE COLUMN OF STEAM.

His face contorts as he accelerates high above the surface
and leaves the moon behind. His radio SPUTTERS and cuts out.

The steam subsides but Bob keeps rising higher into orbit and
EXT.

BOB

BOB’

45.

ABOVE THE MOON -- SPACE
floats in orbit around the moon. He looks groggy. Weak.

S P.O.V. Through his fogged helmet visor, Bob sees the

retreating surface of the MOON, then the great GAS-GIANT
looming ominously above, now the STARS, then the MOON again--

For

a brief moment we glimpse HAM sailing away in the other

direction. TOWARD THE PLANET.

Bob mercifully passes out and

Gently he tumbles through the silent, peaceful void of space.

Eventually, he opens his eyes:

BOB’

S P.O.V. Bob stares out at the STARS. And from those

stars a figure slowly emerges. KLARA FLOATS TOWARD HIM,
impossibly, without a suit on -- just as she was when Bob
first saw her -- flying to save him, a fearsome lovely angel.

Bob

The
the

INT.

BOB

looks pleased to see her. Immediately passes out again--

impossible image of Klara FADES AWAY and is replaced by
less romantic sight of a long cable and a GRAPPLING HOOK.

HEECHEE LANDER -- SPACE

opens his eyes, groggily--

He is back inside the Heechee lander. Bob looks over and
watches KLARA at the helm. They’re still wearing spacesuits:

BOB

(foggy)
Hi, honey--

Klara wrestles with the strange controls, FLYING ERRATICALLY.

Bob

KLARA
Hello, Bob.

looks left and right. Sees that he’s the only passenger.

BOB
Where’s Ham?

KLARA
Bad trajectory. Burned up
in the atmosphere.
46.

BOB
Something wrong with the
ship?

Klara has yet to look at Bob--

KLARA
You could say that, yeah.

Bob leans forward in his seat and slowly turns around to see.
BOB'S P.O.V. The rear of the lander is GONE, like a tin can
ripped open by a giant. An ENORMOUS HOLE reveals the stars.

Various shipboard items are still HURLING OUT into the void--
Bob turns around and faces front again, waking up real quick.
He hits the RELEASE on his harness and takes the seat beside

Klara, grabbing the second joystick to help her fly straight:

SAM’S VOICE
You’re coming in too fast--

KLARA
No shit!

EXT. ABOVE THE MOON -- SPACE

THE LANDER RAMS INTO THE SHIP with great velocity. DOCKING

CLAMPS automatically lock turning the two modules back into

one, but the exterior of the craft bends and ruptures SPEWING

GAS AND LIQUID out into space. The ship spins END-OVER-END--
cur TO:

INT. THE MAIN CABIN -- SPACE

The interior of the ship is badly damaged. BOB, KLARA, and
SAM sit around the small table watching each other nervously.

BOB (V.0.)
The docking damaged our life-
support systems... and with

three remaining crew members

equally fond of breathing, we

were going to run out of air.
Now we see the DECK OF CARDS.

BOB (V.0.)
But two of us might make it--

Klara picks up the deck. Very thoroughly shuffles the cards.
47.

Klara deals one card to Sam, one to Bob, then one to herself.

She turns hers over first. A good card, not great. Sam goes
next. So far he has the low card. Bob looks at his card but
doesn’t reveal it. We search his face for some sign, a clue.

curt TO:

INT. THE FREEZER -- SPACE

BOB opens the door revealing the icy claustrophobic interior
of the strange Heechee FREEZER. He shares a look with KLARA.

SAM stands some distance away:

SAM
I’1l give you guys a minute
alone. Sorry, Bob, but you
know, better you than me...

Sam pushes off through the cabin. Klara waits for him to go.

KLARA
What the hell are you doing?
I dealt you--

BOB
A high card, thanks, baby...
I have other plans.

Bob reaches in his pocket for that weird Heechee SCREWDRIVER.

KLARA
What’s that?

BOB
I don’t know. I guarantee
nobody knows. But if we
hand it over to the company
we'll never see it again--

KLARA
So you want to turn yourself
into a popsicle?

Bob looks excited. Alive. And he has no intention of dying:

BOB
This is the big one, Klara.
The Heechee are out there
somewhere. And you and me?
We’re going to find them...
48.

Bob and Klara continue to speak, desperately, hurriedly; and
suddenly they kiss, like it may be their last, as we listen--

BOB (V.0.)
And so, my mission report is
nearly finished. We lost two
crewmen and I’m set for cold
storage. The ship is damaged
beyond our ability to repair.
I saw nothing unusual on the
surface of the moon or during
my time beneath the surface.
(short pause)
And no artifacts were found.

Bob slips feet-first into the freezer, hides the screwdriver
in his jumpsuit, and crosses his arms in front of his chest
..-like a corpse in a coffin.

Klara closes the door. FROST IS FORMING ON HIS FACE. Bob
looks around, his body shivering, and finally shuts his eyes:

BOB (V.0.)
This is R. Broadhead, mission
number 29-140...signing off--
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. GATEWAY DOCK -- DAY

A SECURITY TEAM wearing containment suits slips a familiar-
looking ROD into the SOCKET of a DAMAGED SHIP. It opens and

INT. HEECHEE SHIP -- DAY
The SECURITY TEAM enters the craft. The interior is damp and
dark. They walk around. SAM is unconscious on the floor.
KLARA looks at them, weakly--
SECURITY GUY
Oh. You’re alive-- We were
wondering.

He reaches into the pocket of his containment suit, pulls out
a hundred dollar BILL...and hands it to the woman beside him.

INT. THRU SECURITY -- DAY

BOB lies on a medical GURNEY being rushed down the corridor--
49,

He is several shades of blue and FROZEN STIFF. KLARA rushes
to the stretcher trying to see him. The SECURITY MEN grab
her, but she doesn’t go without a struggle, kicking her legs:

KLARA
Let me go. Let me... Bob!

The HEAVY-SET NURSE seen earlier quickly wheels Bob through
several short crazily-winding tunnels. They pass SHIKY. He
turns about and flaps his wings faster, keeping up with them.

SHIKY
Bob. You didn’t take me on
your mission. You said you
would take me, Bob--

The nurse gestures with her arm, like she’s trying to swat
away a huge, irritating bug:

NURSE
He can’t hear you, now buzz
off!

Shiky stops chasing them and just hangs in the air, his wings
fluttering, watching Bob go.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- DAY

BOB lies on a high-tech hospital bed with HOSES sticking out
of his mouth and nose. WARMING PADS have been placed all
over his body, his frozen clothes undisturbed. A web of
WIRES stretches to the loud HUMMING machinery around the bed.

TWO DOCTORS bend over him. One feels for his pulse, sort of
optimistic. The other lifts Bob’s eyelid and shines a LIGHT.

DOCTOR #1
Pulse is okay. You know, we
might actually save this guy.

DOCTOR #2
We saved that guy last week--

DOCTOR #1
You mean the vegetable?

The doctors finish up for the moment and leave Bob all alone.
The seconds pass. The machines HUM. When he thinks enough

time has passed, BOB OPENS HIS EYES. He scans the hospital
room, staring intensely at the ceiling directly overhead.....
50.

INT. DEBRIEFING ROOM -- DAY

BOB sits in a stark room with several warm TOWELS wrapped
around him, a funny-looking HOT PAD perched precariously atop
his head, and a steaming cup of COFFEE cradled in his hands--

On the other end of this long table sits assistant director
EMMA FOTHER, no less imposing in a one-on-one than she was
earlier addressing the new arrivals. She scans her NOTE PAD.

EMMA
And why didn’t you document
your moon walk?

BOB
Dred had the camera. He was
dead. At the time, I didn’t
think to take it.

EMMA
Well Mr. Broadhead, I think
we've “grilled you” enough--
(short pause)
I trust you’re feeling well.

She smiles. Bob welcomes it.

BOB
I am very tired.

EMMA
Of course you are. Just one
more question...

BOB
Sure.
EMMA
Where did you hide it?
BOB
Excuse me--
EMMA

The artifact you acquired on
the moon. Where is it, you
son-of-a-bitch?

He studies her. She studies him. Neither one of them moves.
The tension grows and grows until Bob suddenly breaks out in

a big smile, wagging his finger at Emma, like, that was a
good one, you really got me! Now they both LAUGH in relief--
51.

BOB
You really had me going for
a second there, Ms. Fother!

EMMA
Emma, please.
BOB
All right...
EMMA
(explaining)

You have to understand, not
everyone appreciates what the
Gateway Corporation gives the
human race. New technologies.
New sources of power. Food.
New worlds to live in. We’ve
got a whole universe out here
to discover, and bring home.

Bob nods his head. Of course.

EMMA (CONT'D)
Not content to turn in their
find and accept the generous
bonus that awaits them, some
people attempt to hide things
from us and pursue their own
individual goals, for what
they mistakenly believe will
be greater wealth and fame--

BOB
I can’t understand that kind
of thinking, Emma.

EMMA
I’m glad, Bob. Unless there
is something else you’d care
to add to the record, I’d say
this debriefing is concluded.

BOB
Great. So, I’m free to go?

Emma hits a BUTTON on her desk and the door opens behind him.
Bob stands up. He doesn’t see the SECURITY GUARDS coming in:

EMMA
On behalf of all of us, I'd
like to thank you again for
your interest in Gateway...
52.

To Bob’s surprise, the security guards take hold of his arms.
That pad falls off his head--

BOB
What is this?

Emma casually refers to her personal computer SCREEN. Types.

EMMA
As you know...room and board
on Gateway is expensive, and
your per capita ran out the
day you left on mission 29-140.
I’m afraid you’re breathing
air you can no longer afford.

BOB
How about a job? Give me a
job. I can work--

EMMA
There are no positions avail-
able at the moment.

BOB
(struggling)
Come on, talk to me! Let’s

make a deal...
She deactivates the RECORDER.

EMMA
Off the record, Bob, I do
bend the rules for people
who get results-- Can you
think of anything you may
have forgotten to tell me?

They wait. Bob doesn’t say anything...and they drag him out.

EMMA
My men will escort you to the
nearest airlock, where a ship
is in final preparation for
Earth departure. Do be on it.

Emma gets back to work, forgetting about him, adding by rote:

EMMA (CONT'D)

The Gateway Corporation cannot
guarantee the availability of
another shuttle to receive you.
53.

INT. TUNNELS -- DAY

KLARA tries to look nonchalant pacing the corridor outside
the debriefing room. The door opens and BOB emerges escorted
by those grim SECURITY GUARDS.

Bob and Klara share a furtive glance before the guards take
his arms and lead him away. Klara can do nothing but follow.

They pass a SCREEN displaying a PICTURE OF BOB with a really
fake smile. It’s roughly animated, like he’s waving goodbye:

VOICE OF GATEWAY
Gateway bids a fond farewell
to Robert Broadhead, leaving
us to pursue other interests.
Thanks for everything, Bob--
and good luck!

A motley CROWD OF PEOPLE have stopped at a rocky INTERSECTION
formed by two crossing tunnels. Bob and the guards stop like
everyone else, and Bob looks:

BOB'S P.O.V. That UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT seen earlier
speeds toward the intersection, a metal ball with bug arms...

Everybody stands there bored, like pedestrians waiting for a
light to change. Klara squeezes through to the front of the
pack, close to Bob. They share an intense look. Are you
thinking what I’m thinking...?

The ancient Heechee object flies down the hall, so fast it’s
hazardous, WHIRRING madly and

At the last possible instant Bob and Klara run for the other
side, barely making it across.

The security guards follow them into the passage a second
later and are STRUCK BY THE SPHERE, lifted off their feet,
and thrown into the walls. They slide to the floor out cold.

The object continues on like nothing happened and disappears
around the far corner. Bob and Klara hurry into an ELEVATOR.

INT. ELEVATOR -- DAY

The doors shut. KLARA immediately turns to BOB and puts her
hands all over him, as if trying to make sure he’s all there.

KLARA
You’re alive--
54.

A second later she SLAPS him:

KLARA (CONT'D)
That’s for making me worry!

Bob’s mouth begins to form an “OW” until Klara pulls him
close and plants a kiss on his lips. This response he likes.

KLARA

So what’s the plan?
BOB

The what?
KLARA

The plan. You have a plan,
right? Please tell me you
have a plan.

BOB
We go back where I stashed
the screwdriver, avoid the
guards, escape the asteroid,
find the Heechee wherever
they are, have the greatest
adventure in human history
and live happily ever after.

KLARA
(not convinced)
There is no plan, is there?

The tiny SCREEN in the elevator plays an informative CARTOON.

VOICE OF GATEWAY
Remember, if you encounter a
collapsing neutron star, run
a full gravitational scan...

Bob and Klara turn to the screen. See a cartoon SHIP with a
SCARED FACE turning around and heading back the way it came--

VOICE OF GATEWAY
.-. and if you see a black
hole -- run for your lives!

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- DAY

BOB and KLARA sneak into his old hospital room. Their feet
pass a sign reading “CAUTION!” We see a vacuum-shaped ROBOT
MOPPING AND WAXING the floor.
55.

Bob leaves a trail of FOOTPRINTS as he hurries across the
room toward the hospital bed.

KLARA
You must have melted all
over the floor.

Bob steps on the bed and jumps toward the ceiling, grabbing a
bar and hanging there. He reaches his hand up through a
CEILING PANEL, and feels around for the Heechee screwdriver--

Bob grows worried. He raises himself higher and sticks his
head into the NARROW SPACE between the man-made ceiling and
the original jagged walls of the asteroid. Bob looks around.

But there is nothing up here.

INT. MEDICAL TUNNEL -- DAY

BOB and KLARA step uncertainly from the room and lean against
the wall. The passage is crowded with DOCTORS, PATIENTS, and
VISITORS rushing around. A SCREEN runs DAILY CLASSIFIED ADS:

VOICE OF GATEWAY
Need to cry? I can help you
find your pain. Phone 88-622.

KLARA
(reaching)
Are you sure this is where
you hid it? Maybe...

Bob sees someone in the crowd and straightens up, quickly
coming to attention, his eyes zeroing in on DANE METCHNIKOV--

Dane is involved in some no-doubt dubious negotiation with a
WOUNDED PATIENT. He glances around nervously...and sees Bob.

Dane does an incriminating double-take, like Bob is the last
person he wanted to see. Suddenly, Dane turns tail and runs.

INT. GATEWAY MARKET -- DAY

BOB AND KLARA pursue DANE through a tunnel and out into an
open market. It is total chaos. They push THROUGH THE CROWD
trying to keep pace with him...but all too quickly Bob and
Klara find themselves separated, with Dane nowhere in sight--

A SELLER holding a STACK OF BOOKS in his arms approaches Bob.
56.

BOOKSELLER
“Everything You Always Wanted
to Know About the Heechee” --
that’s a book you gotta read!

Bob sees SECURITY GUARDS moving his way. He turns his back
to them, like he’s just a guy buying a book, handing over a
BILL and taking his copy. Quickly, the bookseller gets lost.

Bob pretends to read as the guards pass, thumbing through the
book. ALL THE PAGES ARE BLANK.

He drops the book, and suddenly spots Klara trapped in the
crowd, gesturing wildly. Bob sees Dane slip down a passage--

INT. UNEXPLORED REGION -- DAY

These passages are dark, the walls less luminescent, still
covered in a thousand years of dust. BOB and KLARA run into
an empty tunnel. A small ROCK falls on Bob and they look up:

DANE is trying to climb into what looks like a VENTILATION
SHAFT, his small legs kicking wildly. Bob pulls him down and

DANE
Whatever I did, I’m innocent.

Bob lifts Dane and turns him upside-down, shaking him to get
everything out of his pockets. A whole pile of CONTRABAND
GOODS falls to the floor, cigarettes and nylon stockings,
pills and chocolate bars, currency from countless nations and

DANE (CONT'D)
Just tell me what you want
and I can get it -- cheap!

Bob turns him upright. He and Klara share an uncertain look.

KLARA
If you didn’t do anything,
why are you running away?

DANE
Because you’re chasing me!

They hear the sound of approaching FOOTSTEPS. Bob lets him
go, and Dane scurries off down the passage. Bob and Klara
quickly duck out of view as SECURITY GUARDS enter the tunnel.

They watch the guards. The seconds pass. Bob doesn’t notice
something reach out for Klara and PULL HER INTO THE DARKNESS.
57.

The security guards move closer. Bob sees Klara is gone. He
takes a step into the dark and

INT. SPHERICAL CHAMBER -- DAY

BOB enters the dark chamber, discovers there is no step at
all and DROPS. He rolls down a slope and hits bottom. KLARA
is already sitting up, a bit disheveled and rubbing her head.

MALE VOICE
There are dark, musty places
still untouched by human hands.
Until recently, when I began
my own expeditions deeper into
the asteroid, this was one of
them.

They hear a CLICK and see PROFESSOR HEGRAMET standing beside
a portable human-made LIGHT--

PROFESSOR
Professor Hegramet...at your
service!

They are inside a large spherical chamber, walls perfectly
round and smooth, a big ball.

Bob and Klara stand up. Look. The rock is oddly reflective.

KLARA
Is it...a tomb?

PROFESSOR
The lack of adornment on the
walls discourages the notion.
And there was nothing hidden
within.

BOB
Maybe the aliens took what-
ever was in here with them.

PROFESSOR
Yes. But then why go to all
the trouble of concealing an
empty chamber?

KLARA
And who were they hiding it
from? Others of their kind
+.-0rF us?
The Professor sits on the slope. Pulls out a PIPE to smoke.
58.

PROFESSOR
I do not have the answers you
seek, but I am certain all of
this -- the ships, Gateway, the
artifacts scattered across the
stars -- is here for a reason.

BOB
(jumping on that)
What reason?

PROFESSOR
More prospectors ship out day-
by-day, but few return. What
happens to the ones who never
come back? Do they simply die
in the icy cold of space, or is
there a more clandestine fate
awaiting them? Could this be
a collection trap, the human
race systematically captured
by the Heechee, and subjected
to obscene alien experiments--

Professor Hegramet strikes a MATCH. Stops to light his pipe.

PROFESSOR (CONT’D)
On the other hand...it might
be an elaborate intelligence
test. Maybe the Heechee have
retreated to a distant corner
of the galaxy, waiting a
millennia for a civilization
smart enough to complete the
ancient puzzle and find them!

The Professor takes a long PUFF from the pipe, and concludes.

PROFESSOR (CONT’D)
Perhaps this once-great society
simply died out long before our
species crawled from the muck,
and this is all what it appears
to be: an old forgotten rock.

KLARA
Why did you help us, professor?

PROFESSOR
Isn’t that why we come here,
my dear? To test ourselves and
find out what we’re made of.

Then he grows a devilish grin:
59.

PROFESSOR (CONT’D)
Besides... if you’re running
from the guards, one can
assume your mission produced
interesting results.

Bob and Klara share a look and quickly agree, let’s tell him.

BOB
We call it a screwdriver...

PROFESSOR
Ah. And where is this screw-
driver now?

BOB
I don’t know. But I saw
something out there, something
alive. And I touched it.

PROFESSOR
Indeed.

KLARA
You believe us?

PROFESSOR
Consider the likelihood of our
missing aliens, so meticulous
in cleaning up after themselves
..-leaving tools lying around.

Bob and Klara hadn’t considered that. The professor smokes.

PROFESSOR (CONT’D)
You were out there looking for
the Heechee, but they may have
found you.

curt TO:
INT. UNEXPLORED REGION -- DAY

BOB, KLARA, and PROFESSOR HEGRAMET struggle to slide a ROCKY
DOOR back into place. It’s not easy. When it finally closes
the wall appears solid, the spherical room completely hidden.

The professor is the first to turn around and see something--

PROFESSOR
Oh, bugger.
Bob spins around and takes down the first SECURITY GUARD with
his old reliable punch in the jaw. ANOTHER GUARD runs up and
Bob throws him into the wall -- where Klara finishes him off.
60.

The NEXT GUARD lunges. Bob blocks the blow and takes him
out. He shares a relieved look with Klara and the Professor.

A split-second later all three of them are STRUCK by atazer--
Their bodies stiffen and shake...and then drop to the floor.
MORE SECURITY GUARDS run over.

INT. A TUNNEL -- DAY

BOB hangs limply from the arms of the SECURITY GUARDS as they
move him through the tunnels. He starts to come around when
they change direction and drag him backwards into an AIRLOCK.

INT. AIRLOCK -- DAY

The SECURITY GUARDS unceremoniously deposit BOB on the floor,
and quickly walk back out again. The inner door slides shut.

Bob struggles to stand. The airlock is claustrophobic, dark,
and ominous. He turns toward the outer door and sees STARS.
Bob POUNDS on the thick glass:

BOB
Hey, there’s no ship here.
Where’s the ship to Earth?

The grinning face of a security guard appears in the window--

SECURITY GUARD
It left 5 minutes ago. So
long, sucker!

The guard leaves. Bob POUNDS on the glass until the lights
turn RED. The ALARM sounds--

A tiny SCREEN inside the airlock displays a RELIGIOUS SYMBOL.

VOICE OF GATEWAY
Staring death in the face?
Join the Church of the
Heechee... it’s later than
you think!

Bob waits for the inevitable. The outer door opens and with
a brief deafening BURST he is violently BLOWN OUT. His body
hurls toward the distant stars.
61.

EXT. INTO THE VOID -- SPACE

BOB tumbles helplessly into space... and suddenly STOPS, as
if caught by an invisible hand.

INT. WORKER’S POD -- SPACE

BOB looks surprised as powerful JETS OF AIR blow in his face.
There is the sound of a HATCH closing, LIGHTS come on, and we
see Bob is tangled in WEBBING--

EXT. WORKER’S POD -- SPACE

A common MAINTENANCE POD HOVERS IN SPACE some distance from
the asteroid and the small airlock door Bob just blew out of.

INT. WORKER’S POD -- SPACE

BOB opens his mouth and desperately BREATHES as the cargo bin
repressurizes. NORMAL SKIN COLOR slowly returns to his face.

Soon a pod door slides open and EMMA FOTHER enters the cabin.

She wears SPACE SHOES that enable her to stick to the floor,
as long as she walks precisely, each step accompanied by that
annoying Velcro RIPPING sound--

Bob turns his head and follows her progress across the pod,
like he can’t believe this. Emma speaks into a miniscule
HEADSET. Ignoring him for now:

EMMA
No, cancel that, reschedule
for next week, and hold all
calls.

She glances at Bob for the first time. Not happy to see him.

EMMA (CONT'D)
My twelve o’clock is here--

Emma pulls off the headset. Takes a seat. A VELCRO PAD ON
HER BUTTOCKS enables her to remain in place without floating.

EMMA
Thanks to you, my whole day
is ruined.
62.

Bob lies tangled in the webbing like food for a giant spider.

He grows suddenly furious and:

BOB
Cram it, lady!

EMMA
Oh don’t be a baby.

BOB
You almost killed me--

EMMA
The Gateway Corporation has
authorized me to speak with
you in private.

BOB
What do we have to talk
about?
EMMA
You went back to Terminal
Hospital.
BOB
Did I?
EMMA
You left your footprints on
the floor.
BOB
So I was there... so what?
EMMA
Imagine what it could mean,
Bob-- A genuine Heechee

tool could mean a way to
open the drive mechanism in
their starships, without
blowing everything up. A
tool could mean finding out
how the drive works and
building our own. A tool
could mean almost anything.

BOB
(pushing her)
Sounds real valuable.

EMMA
Yes. Do you have it?
63.

BOB
No.

Emma rises from her seat accompanied by a giant RIPPING sound
from the Velco pad on her ass.

BOB (CONT’D)
But I know who does.

She sits back down and thinks.

EMMA
A colossal bluff--

BOB
Make me a deal and find out.

EMMA

The deal will be as follows:
You will recover the object
and bring it to me. If the
artifact is valuable you can
expect a reasonable bonus...
minus any and all expenses
incurred by the company as
a result of your subterfuge.
If you fail to recover the
item, or do not hand it over
to me immediately upon its
recovery, you will be blown
out an airlock -- only this
time, there won’t be anyone
here to catch you.

(short pause)
Are the terms satisfactory?

Bob doesn’t really think so, but is in no position to dicker.
cur TO:
INT. CORRIDOR -- DAY

BOB and EMMA FOTHER step out of the airlock into a tunnel.
KLARA is already standing there, watched by a SECURITY GUARD.

As soon as Emma gets in range Klara cocks back her arm to
sock her in the jaw. The guard grabs her wrist and stops it.

EMMA
Striking a corporate officer
is prohibited by sub-section
two, paragraph seven of your
Memorandum of Agreement--
64.

That just makes Klara want to punch her more. She lunges at
Emma again and the guard struggles to hold on, placing his
hand on her mouth to MUFFLE a string of intended obscenities.

Emma turns and hurries off--

The guard lets Klara loose. Bob immediately takes her arm,
and leads her the other way:

BOB
Come on.
KLARA
Where are we going?
BOB
To see a guy.
KLARA
What guy?
BOB

The only guy who doesn’t
leave footprints.

INT. LITTERED TUNNEL -- DAY

SHIKY brandishes his BROOM sweeping SHARDS OF HEECHEE METAL
into a pile, as we saw him do before, wings flapping happily.

He looks up and finds BOB AND KLARA standing in the tunnel
watching. Shiky doesn’t try to escape, but immediately looks
guilty, wings not so perky--

SHIKY
You said you would take me,
Bob, but you didn’t mean it
-+. just like all the rest.

Shiky lowers his head like a little boy, and slowly comes up
with the Heechee SCREWDRIVER. He raises his arm toward them.

SHIKY (CONT’D)
Please, forgive me, Bob...

INT. ANOTHER PASSAGE -- DAY

BOB and KLARA walk through the tunnels with the SCREWDRIVER.
They don’t make it far before a group of SECURITY GUARDS step
65.

into view, blocking the passage ahead. Bob and Klara stop,
like they know this is the end of the line, they’re finished:

KLARA
I guess we’re luckier than
most -- we shipped out and

lived to tell about it.

BOB
It’s not enough, Klara.

KLARA
It’s never enough. Come
on. Let’s give them the
screwdriver, cash our
check...and go get drunk.

She looks at Bob. Sees the look in his eyes. And she knows:

KLARA (CONT'D)
Aw, nuts--

Bob grabs her hand and they run down a branching tunnel. The
security guards GIVE CHASE and

INT. MAINTENANCE TUNNEL -- DAY

BOB and KLARA run into a passage lined with MAN-MADE LOCKERS
and equipment. They duck out of view and hope for the best--

The SECURITY GUARDS follow them a few seconds later, quickly
look around, guess incorrectly, and charge off again. Far
down the tunnel we glimpse MORE SECURITY GUARDS searching and

KLARA
This is hopeless. I know
you want to find the Heechee.
Me too-- But there’s no way
off this asteroid.

BOB
Maybe one way.

Bob wraps his arm around her waist, and pulls Klara close,
laying an old-fashioned kiss on her lips. She is surprised--

KLARA
What was that for?

BOB
I’ve got another really bad
idea. Don’t be mad.
66.

Bob pushes her backwards into one of the lockers lining the
tunnel. He shuts the door and LOCKS IT before her face can
fully register what’s going on.

Klara begins to POUND on it, and Bob hurries down the tunnel.

KLARA (0.S.)
Open this door. What are
you doing? Let me out!
You come back here, Bob--

INT. LAUNCH FLOOR -- NIGHT

The room is dark and deserted, shut-down for the day. The
grizzled LAUNCH CAPTAIN is asleep in his chair on top of the
high platform... and he SNORES.

BOB (0.S.)
I want to ship out.

The launch captain jerks awake. Sees BOB. Checks a screen--

LAUNCH CAPTAIN
Broadhead... You’re on the
no-fly list.

BOB
You can let me take a “one,”
can’t you? The rules say
anybody can ship out on a
one -- anytime they want to,
right?

LAUNCH CAPTAIN
Yeah... but that’s because
single-man ships usually
don’t, you know, come back.
Bob raises his completed information FORM, and SLAPS it down.

BOB
I’ll take it.

curt TO:
67.

INT. ONE-MAN SHIP -- SPACE

BOB sits inside a claustrophobic metal cylinder, a cluttered
alien garbage can, completely alone and with no room to move.

BOB (V.0.)
This is Bob Broadhead’s log--
I’m racing through warp space
never to be seen again... if
you believe that sorta thing.

Now we realize Bob is staring at the strange BLACK DRIVE BOX.

BOB (V.0.)
The drive box has been opened
before by a curious, desperate,
or just plain crazy few who
didn’t live long enough to see
inside. Of course they didn’t
have my Heechee screwdriver...

He pulls out the alien SCREWDRIVER. Just stares at the box--

BOB (V.0.)
Still, if anybody ever plays
this back, I’1l warn you up
front: the next thing you hear
may be a really big KA-BOOM.

DISSOLVE TO:

Bob studies the box. He is tired and covered in sweat, with
some STUBBLE on his face. Several days have passed at least.

BOB (V.0.)
I study the box for days ‘til
I’m sure I know how it opens.

Bob makes his decision. He touches the screwdriver to one
spot and an ENERGY DISCHARGE THROWS HIM BACK into a bulkhead.

He slumps to the floor, curled in a ball, knocked out cold...
DISSOLVE TO:

By now, Bob is definitely on his way toward GROWING A BEARD--
He studies the weird alien box.

Suddenly Bob tries again, approaching the problem from a new
perspective. He eases the screwdriver into a small recess,
and wiggles it around a little.
68.

A small POINT of light mysteriously appears over the box. As
Bob watches in surprise, the point DRAWS A SHAPE in the air,
and inside the shape an IMAGE abruptly appears. It must be
an alien communications system, some kind of ancient Heechee
television screen materializing suddenly out of nothingness--

Bob stares at the picture. Can’t make it out. It’s like a
close-up of some strange bumps...and maybe a few weird hairs?

Then the thing on the screen turns around and Bob sees an
ALIEN EYEBALL STARING BACK AT HIM. We see it BLINK once, but
not like any human eye blinks.

For a brief moment Bob watches the eye watching him-- And
then the ship fills with a HORRIBLE NOISE. Could this be the
Heechee language?! As if the alien is screaming in anger and

Suddenly the eyeball is GONE. The strange screen in the air
FIZZLES OUT and Bob is alone--

BOB (V.0.)
Maybe I found a recording, a
message from a million years
ago. Yeah, right. Or maybe
I just phoned the Heechee --
and they hung up on me. Was
that alien for “hi, how are

ya?”, or “go away?” Either

being the case, I guess they
know I’m out here. Good...

because I’m not goin’ away--

DISSOLVE TO:

Bob sports a FULL DIRTY BEARD and lies curled on the floor,
staring up at the drive box as he absently taps his alien
screwdriver against the metal of the ship. We listen to the
constant maddening KTANG...KTANG...KTANG-- And slowly, Bob
entertains a new possibility. He looks down at his strange
tool as he keeps tapping the floor: KTANG...KTANG...KTANG...

DISSOLVE TO:

Bob stands facing the box. Suddenly he rushes wildly forward
and raises the screwdriver high in the air, holding it like
an ice pick and bringing it down hard, striking the drive and

Bob looks at his hand. The screwdriver is VIBRATING madly
and it hurts, his arm shaking. It’s not a screwdriver at all
but a Heechee tuning fork, RELEASING A HIGH-PITCHED WHINE and

The diamond shape drive responds fast, OPENING LIKE A PUZZLE
BOX, the light within bathing the interior in an EERIE GLOW--
69.

Bob watches in genuine wonder as an important-looking CONTROL
BUTTON rises up out of the box.

BOB
(girding himself)
Well, here goes nothin’...

Bob hits the button and the SHIP CHANGES COURSE, lurching out
of control. He finds a hand-hold and hangs on for dear life.

DISSOLVE TO:

Bob sleeps curled on the floor. Slowly he FLOATS in the air.
Bob wakes excitedly and pulls himself to the equipment,
flipping a SWITCH. He checks the SCRATCHES he made to count:

BOB
It’s Day 51. The ship has
dropped out of warp!

Suddenly there is a loud DOOM, like something outside just
made contact with the hull, and the entire ship TILTS and
shakes. Bob checks his primitive SCANNER and hears the PING.

BOB (CONT’D)
There’s something outside.
I think I’m being towed--
The scanner is picking up
pure Heechee metal, off
the chart, something huge.

Ominous sounds continue to REVERBERATE through the bulkheads
into the ship, like the eerie haunts heard in a submarine.
There is a THUD and Bob drops to the floor. Gravity’s back--

BOB
The ship has stopped....
I’ve landed. Is this the
homeworld of the aliens?

There are more sounds, elusive, always moving -- CREATURES
GATHERING OUTSIDE THE SHIP. There is a BANG at the hatch and

BOB
They’re at the hatch. 1/11
keep recording as long as I
can... They’re coming in--

The hatch begins to OPEN and:
BOB (CONT’D)

(to the Heechee)
Take me to your leader!
70.

A familiar Gateway SECURITY TEAM stares down at Bob from
inside their protective suits.

RUDE GUY
Whatever, dick-head.

curt TO:
INT. DEBRIEFING ROOM -- DAY

BOB slumps on one side of the table, with his filthy beard
and torn clothes. EMMA FOTHER scans the SINGLE-PAGE REPORT--

EMMA
So let me get this straight:
you went absolutely nowhere.

BOB
Where’s Klara?

EMMA
Who? Oh, yes...Klara. She
left for Earth, weeks ago--
You took off in a one, Bob,
did you think she was going
to spend the rest of her life
waiting for you to no-show?
She did throw you a party...
sort of a memorial service.

BOB
How was it?

EMMA
I didn’t attend.

BOB
Why don’t you just do what-
ever it is you’re going to
do to me.

EMMA
Do to you, Bob? I’m sure I
don’t know what you mean...

Emma opens a folder. Takes out a CHECK. Slides it across
the table toward him and says:

EMMA (CONT'D)
The company has authorized me
to award you a five thousand
dollar science bonus for com-
ing back alive.
71.

Bob is surprised. He picks up the check. Just stares at it.
Now Emma reaches back into her folder and pulls out a WORK
ASSIGNMENT. Slides it to Bob.

EMMA
I’ve also been authorized
to give you a work assignment.
The pay is good enough to
cover your continued room
and board here on Gateway.

BOB
You must be pissed.

Emma doesn’t respond right away. She turns off the RECORDER.

EMMA
I’m not upset, Bob. Would
you like to know why?

BOB
I don’t think so, no.

EMMA
You took your shot at the big
time, and missed.

BOB
Just wait, on the next trip--

EMMA
A thousand men and women have
come here, like you, with the
arrogant presumption they can
rock the universe. The lucky
ones die in space-- The rest
slowly waste away on this
asteroid, still talking about
the next trip.

They stare one another down. TWO SECURITY GUARDS enter, and:

BOB
Are we done?

EMMA
Oh, one more thing....

Emma opens up her drawer, takes out that HEECHEE SCREWDRIVER,
and tosses it across the table like it’s just worthless junk.

EMMA (CONT'D)
You can have this back.
72.

He takes the tool. Confused.

EMMA

Last month, a crew returned
with a dozen. A week after
that, another ship brought

back a whole crate-- We’ve
got so many of these damned
things they’re going on sale
in the gift shop downstairs.

She looks over at the guards:

EMMA (CONT'D)
See that he gets cleaned up,
then issue him a broom, and
put him to work.

INT. CORRIDOR -- DAY

BOB walks listlessly through the tunnel in his filthy beard
and torn clothes, accompanied by the SECURITY GUARDS. Now
SHIKY flies alongside, flapping his wings and smiling at Bob.

SHIKY
Bob, we all had a good time
at your “Bob is dead” party.

Shiky has a hard time keeping pace in the thickening CROWD,
and starts falling behind--

SHIKY (CONT’D)
When it is time to ship out
again, don’t forget me. In
orbit I’m as good as anybody!
If you need a crewman, you
will think of me, yes, Bob?

Bob doesn’t say anything. Just lets the guards lead him by
the arms. A SCREEN runs photographs of CLOTHES and odd JUNK:

VOICE OF GATEWAY
Attention, attention... Our
public auction of personal
effects of non-returnees was
an enormous success-- A big
thanks to all who attended!

(short pause)
In a related topic, would
whoever has Bob Broadhead’s
things please return them?
73.

There is a sudden BLOCKAGE in the tunnel, dozens of people
gathering around to see. One of the security guards leans
close to a MAN IN THE CROWD:

SECURITY GUARD
What’s up?

MAN IN CROWD
Ship came in... Once-in-a-
lifetime score.

SECURITY GUARD
No kidding.

MAN IN CROWD
Found another asteroid just
like this one. They’re
calling it “Gateway Two”....
Fifty million dollar bonus,
plus royalties on every
dollar the new Gateway earns
for the rest of their lives.

SECURITY GUARD
Here they come--

Everybody moves back against the wall as MEDICAL PERSONNEL
rush past with STRETCHERS carrying the UNCONSCIOUS CREW of
the lucky ship. They look weak and dehydrated. Almost dead.

We don’t recognize anyone until the very last gurney rolls by
holding SHERI. Her eyes lock on Bob, and she smiles, weakly:

SHERI
(semi-conscious)
..-Hiya, Bob...

Bob watches Sheri roll away.

SECURITY GUARD
You know her?

BOB
(remembering)
Yeah. She asked me to go
along. I said no.

The two security guards share a look. Can’t help but LAUGH.
They SLAP Bob on the back...

SECURITY GUARD
What a chump!
74.

INT. UNEXPLORED REGION -- DAY

BOB is shaved and wearing a new jumpsuit, but looks no less
downtrodden, pushing his BROOM.

He sweeps up those weird METAL SHARDS littering the asteroid.

Bob stops working. Something is bothering him. He sits on
top of his pile of junk and reaches into his pocket. Takes
out the Heechee SCREWDRIVER....

Bob stares at it with a raw mix of emotions. Finally anger
wins over the rest and he throws the thing across the tunnel.

It hits the wall with a loud KTANG, and falls to the floor.
Bob walks over. Picks it up--

The screwdriver is VIBRATING in his hand, like it did before.

Bob doesn’t see it, but behind him those strange reflective
shards he’d been sweeping are SUSPENDED IN THE AIR, hanging
there, jagged pieces of metal floating high above the floor--

Bob sticks the screwdriver back in his pocket. Like he can’t
stand it anymore. Just wants to pretend nothing happened and

Bob turns around. He doesn’t notice anything out of the
ordinary, because now the metal is BACK ON THE FLOOR where it
should be. Bob keeps sweeping.

Soon he is pushed from behind--

Bob turns around to see that ENORMOUS MAN from the tavern who
wanted to fight over the stool.

BOB
Oh, great.

Now DANE METCHNIKOV steps out from behind the giant, looking
and sounding braver than usual:

DANE
Howzitgoin’, Bob? My giant
friend here was lookin’ for
you. I hope you don’t mind,
I happened to mention that
you were a broom jockey now.

BOB
I’m busy--

Bob tries to return to his sweeping, but the enormous man
takes the broom away, CRACKS it in half like a twig and gives
75.

it back. Bob looks at the broken handle, like he knows there
is no way out of this fight...

He drops the broom, turns to the giant, and socks him in the
gut. The blow has no effect, and Bob prepares for the worst.

DANE
He wants me to tell you it’s
nothing personal, but he has
a reputation to keep. When
this is all over he’d like to
buy you a drink, as soon as
you’re able to swallow again.

The enormous man cocks back his big arm, throws a punch, and
hits METAL. The giant YELLS OUT and stumbles back. In pain.

BOB IS ENCASED IN ALIEN ARMOR.

The strange shrapnel littering the tunnel is rising from the
floor and assembling around him, the jagged pieces fitting
together, like a crazy puzzle.

Bob turns around and around, trying to get it off, swatting
at the shards, a hopeless battle against a tornado of metal--

Dane watches the LAST SHARDS circle around Bob until the
shapes find their matching spots and slip into place,
covering Bob from head-to-toe.

The shards reflect light like a hundred BLINDING mirrors and
Dane backs away, trying to shield his face and falling down.
The giant turns and runs away.

Bob’s surprised eyes stare out from two narrow slits in the
armor. He looks down at his body the best he can, raising
his arms and staring at his hands, encased in Heechee metal--

DANE
Wow-- How did you do that?
Can you breathe in there?
Hey, we’re partners on this,
right, Bob-o? Fifty-fifty.
Don’t try to move, don’t do
anything, stay right there.

There is a familiar sound behind them, a furious WHIRRING and
That UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT continually navigating the
tunnels of Gateway rounds the corner -- and heads RIGHT FOR
BOB, a metal ball with bug arms, flying closer and closer and

DANE (CONT'D)
On second thought run away!
76.

Bob turns and runs the other way down the corridor, lumbering
like a medieval knight, with the metal ball in CLOSE PURSUIT.

A stunned Dane watches him go.

Bob looks back over his shoulder, trying to pump his heavy
legs. He’s not fast enough. It reaches him and ATTACHES TO
BOB like an alien jet-pack and

He is lifted off his feet. BOB FLIES THROUGH THE TUNNEL out
of control, faster and faster.

BOB’S P.O.V. He turns a corner, and another, winding his way
deeper into the asteroid until he runs out of space. Bob
speeds toward the DEAD END and

INT. SPHERICAL CHAMBER -- DAY

The wall opens up and BOB FLIES into the hidden spherical
chamber discovered earlier, walls perfectly round and smooth.

PROFESSOR HEGRAMET is inside the room, with a SMALL TOOL in
his hand, examining the interior. He looks up, dumbfounded--

Bob flies into the middle of the chamber, suspended in the
exact center of the sphere. Immediately the armor ACTIVATES:

The walls of the sphere fill with STARS, CONSTELLATIONS and
GALAXIES, PLANETS and MOONS, SUNS and NEBULA. Bob looks like
he’s floating in outer space with the greatest mysteries of
the universe all around him...

His armor is full of stars too, an alien imaging system, and
as Bob struggles and fights the pictures on the walls CHANGE.

Professor Hegramet can’t believe it. He looks around, all
around, as the wonders of the cosmos dance across the sphere:

PROFESSOR
It’s a map. A map!

Bob floats in the center of the chamber, getting the hang of
it now, no longer scared. He begins to manipulate his body
more judiciously, moving his arms and legs in gentle arcs,
spinning slowly, beautifully--

DANE forces open the door. Looks in. Sees what’s happening.
Bob watches the stars shift and change, each stunning vista

replaced by an equally exotic view, alien, breathtaking
...and suddenly the map stops.
77.

Bob stares at a specific STAR FORMATION frozen before him and
Abruptly the image disappears.

BOB FALLS to the ground, and when he hits, the ARMOR SHATTERS
into a hundred jagged pieces--

Professor Hegramet runs over. Dane scrambles down the slope.

By the time they reach Bob, he is lying flat on his back but
okay, LAUGHING like a maniac--

PROFESSOR
Help him...

They get on either side of Bob and lift him up onto his feet.
All three men share a look. Bob can’t wipe the smile off his
face. It grows infectious. Soon all three are smiling wide.

PROFESSOR
Robert, you may have just
found the location of the
missing Heechee.

Dane grows a sneaky look and starts to back away. Bob grabs
his shirt and pulls him close:

BOB
You’re not goin’ anywhere
unless I say it’s okay--
We're partners, remember?

They look up as SHIKY tentatively flies into the chamber. He
is holding Bob’s broken BROOM.

SHIKY
Bob, your broom has been
vandalized. Are you okay?
What’s going on?

Bob throws a glance at the Professor, who nods yes, tell him.
BOB
Forget the brooms, Shiky --
we're going.

SHIKY
Going where?

Bob thinks about it some more and can’t help but LAUGH again.

BOB
To the stars. To the stars!
78.

INT. SMALL BOOTH -- DAY

A SCRATCHY MISSION REPORT plays on a dirty screen. The CREW
MEMBER in front of the camera is tired, barely able to speak:

CREWMAN
We dropped out of warp into a
transpolar orbit. Planet had
three detectable satellites--
Six other planets inferred by
computer logic...

As he speaks the central image is surrounded by PICTURES OF
THE PLANET they found -- plus shots of the SURROUNDING STARS.

CREWMAN (CONT’D)
Scans located a Heechee space
station in orbit. Attempt to
enter failed... Nina and Jim
were killed in the explosion.
Vessel damaged. No artifacts
secured. Biotic samples from
Planet destroyed in damage to--

BOB sits inside a small dark booth watching the specific star
formations. It looks like he’s been doing this a long time.

BOB
(voice command)
Next.

A MISSION NUMBER flashes briefly. Now the face of a FEMALE
CREW MEMBER appears. She’s been crying, her tears dried now.

FEMALE CREWMAN

This is our 281st day. Sunnyi
lost the first draw...and Axel
volunteered 40 days later.

I’m putting everything on full
automatic and taking the pills.
We all wrote letters. Please
forward as addressed, if this
goddamned ship ever gets back--

BOB
Next.

A MISSION NUMBER flashes briefly. Then the nervous face of a
male CREW LEADER appears and:

CREW LEADER
Our radar can’t penetrate the
clouds of dust and vapor.
79.

Pictures of the planet appear, and then a sequence of STAR
FORMATIONS. Bob rubs his eyes hard and tries to concentrate.

CREW LEADER (CONT’D)
Otherwise we are “go” for a
landing. I’m a little worried
about the spots on the sun--

Even Bob is getting depressed.

BOB
Next.

curt TO:
INT. SHIKY’S QUARTERS -- DAY

BOB steps inside and the door closes behind him. This room
is considerably larger than Bob’s closet, but still cramped
for three people. PROFESSOR HEGRAMET sits at a table behind
a STACK OF BOOKS, scanning the pages of another thick volume.

SHIKY flutters across the room with his own book. His wings
flap slower and his body lowers until the collar of his shirt
CATCHES ON A HOOK. He hangs--

SHIKY
(hopeful)
Any luck, Bob?

Bob just shakes his head. No.

PROFESSOR
Patience, my boy-- The stars
do not hide from us... They

twinkle in the sky for all to
see, if you know where to look.

BOB
Maybe what we’re looking for
doesn’t exist anymore. Things
change in a million years...

PROFESSOR
If the Heechee wanted to leave
a map for the next intelligent
species that would follow them
into space, surely they would
compensate for galactic drift--

The door slides open again. This time DANE stumbles inside,
like he’s run a long distance.
80.

DANE
Something’s happening!

INT. COMMUNITY HALL -- DAY

Several dozen PROSPECTORS partly fill a large room that could
hold a great deal more. None of them look particularly happy
to be here. A grizzled FLIGHT DIRECTOR stands at the head of
the assembly, ready to get started, when he sees more enter--

BOB, SHIKY, PROFESSOR HEGRAMET, and DANE slip into the room,
like kids late for math class.

FLIGHT DIRECTOR
Okay. Grab a seat. lLet’s get
started. Most of you are here
by invitation...
(looking their way)
...with one or two exceptions.

Bob and the others take seats.

FLIGHT DIRECTOR
You all know our distinguished
friend, Bob Broadhead. If you
don’t, he’s the guy who opened
a drive box, and spent two
months in warp going nowhere--

A number of people CLAP and CHEER with derision. Bob waves
halfheartedly at his faux fans.

FLIGHT DIRECTOR (CONT’D)
What none of you know is that
the colors on his control panel
were not the regular course
settings for Gateway; and when
the computer compared them, it
came up with a whole new
concept of Heechee navigation.

Everyone immediately quiets, trying to catch up. Did we just
hear what we think we heard...?

FLIGHT DIRECTOR
For the first time, we believe
we can pick a destination, set
course, and go there.

The prospectors MUTTER to one another. Bob, Shiky, Professor
Hegramet and Dane share a look.
81.

FLIGHT DIRECTOR

This mission is simple. We're
sending out a dozen ships to a
dozen different coordinates to
see who gets where they’re sup-
posed to be going... if anyone.
Every crew member on any ship

that successfully reaches its

target destination will receive
a twenty thousand dollar bonus.

The flight director hits a REMOTE. A far GALAXY appears on
the screen directly behind him.

FLIGHT DIRECTOR (CONT’D)
Andromeda, anyone?

A smattering of hands goes up. Not as many as you’d think.
The Flight Director scans the crowd and quickly chooses one--

FLIGHT DIRECTOR
Thanks, Joe, you and your crew.

He makes a note of it on his CLIPBOARD, and hits the remote.
A close-up of a STAR appears--

FLIGHT DIRECTOR
Xi Pegasi A.

More hands go up. The Flight Director locks eyes on one. In
the crowd we see Bob and Professor Hegramet whispering to one
another. Shiky and Dane as well. None of them are paying
attention to the next picture:

IT IS THE STAR FORMATION they saw on the wall of that sphere.

FLIGHT DIRECTOR
All right, next up is...

Bob casually glances, sees the screen, and bolts to his feet:
BOB
(yelling)
I’1l take it!

Everyone turns around and looks. The Professor reaches out
to Bob, but stops himself, not wanting to give anything away.

PROFESSOR
Easy, Robert.

FLIGHT DIRECTOR
Do you have a crew, Broadhead?
82.

BOB
You’re lookin’ at ‘em.

Professor Hegramet, Shiky, and Dane straighten up, and try to
look their best. Doesn’t quite work for the Flight Director.

FLIGHT DIRECTOR
Uh-huh.
(short pause)
I don’t think so.

BOB
Why not?

FLIGHT DIRECTOR
Lots of reasons. You want me
to pick one?

BOB
Yeah--

FLIGHT DIRECTOR
You don’t have an experienced
pilot.

FEMALE VOICE
Oh hell, I’1l fly the ship...

Everyone turns around to see KLARA leaning against the door,
like she’s been here a while--

Bob smiles big, surprised to see her. She gives him a little
back, just enough of a glance, keeping her focus on the
flummoxed flight director, who doesn’t really like surprises.

FLIGHT DIRECTOR
The lady can’t stay away.
(fighting it)
All right. Bob Broadhead and
his crew going to...

The Flight Director seems uncertain. Finally he just turns
around and looks at the screen.

FLIGHT DIRECTOR (CONT’D)
What is that-- Who the hell
picked this one?
He checks his clipboard. Nods.

FLIGHT DIRECTOR
...Zeta Tauri.

curt TO:
INT. HEECHEE SHIP -- SPACE

BOB, KLARA, PROFESSOR HEGRAMET , SHIKY, and DANE fill the
alien cabin with LAUGHTER, tossing one another CANS OF BEER--

BOB (V.0.)
This is Bob Broadhead’s log.
I don’t think any of us have
ever been happier. The case
of beer we snuck on board in
the arms and legs of our
spacesuits went fast, but the
crew has been riding a buzz
since lift-off.

curt TO:

SHIKY flies through the cabin performing a variety of routine
ship tasks. He moves effortlessly and with surprising grace.

BOB (V.0.)
Good ol’ Shiky, who seemed so
ridiculous back on Gateway, has
found a dignity in space the
rest of us can never hope to
match. When we drop out of
warp and hit the zero-g, his
wings come off, and then we'll
really see what he can do....

adventure he’s spent his life
reading and writing about--
He likes his work and GIGGLES.
BOB (V.0.)

He giggles like a school girl,
but won’t admit it.
84.

BOB casually walks past. Immediately, the Professor bellows:

PROFESSOR
That was NOT a giggle!

curt TO:

DANE sits in the lander staring out the porthole at the dark
starless warp space outside. He writes with PEN AND PAPER.
BOB sneaks up behind him and

BOB (V.0.)

I found Dane writing poetry--
His words are descriptive...
maybe even beautiful. When he
asks me I tell him they stink.

Now we see Bob coming back to peek at them again. And again.

BOB (V.0.)
But he catches me coming back
for more, and knows I’m lyin’.

cur TO:
In the lander BOB and KLARA lie wrapped in each other’s arms.

BOB (V.0.)

Klara never made it to Earth.
She hopped off at a refueling
station, and hitched back to
Gateway on a cargo freighter.

KLARA
Thanks, Broadhead.

BOB
For what?

KLARA
I had a lot of things, but
never a crazy dream before...
What’s the point? If you
don’t have anyone to share
it with.

She sounds almost surprised. Bob doesn’t say anything, just
holds her close, and soon enough they’re both soundly asleep.

BOB (V.0.)

We fall asleep, and in my
dream, none of this seems
crazy at all.
85.

curt TO:
INT. HEECHEE SHIP -- DREAM

BOB wakes up and looks around. The ship is empty. He walks
slowly toward that porthole--

BOB (V.0.)
I wake up and find the ship
empty. But I know when I
look out the window I’1l see
exactly what I’m supposed
to see, what every step has
brought me closer to seeing,
and when I do, there won’t
be any doubt left that all
of this has meant something
--us, the Heechee, Gateway--
and the universe will never
feel cold or lonely again.

Bob touches his hand to the glass. THE LIGHT is blinding and

KLARA’S VOICE
Bob? Bob. Bob!

cur TO:
INT. HEECHEE SHIP -- SPACE
BOB wakes up. KLARA feels something. Now he senses it too--

BOB
We’re stopping.

The zero-g kicks in. Bob and Klara FLOAT UP off the floor
and smile at each other, pushing themselves toward the hatch.
They enter the main cabin and

SHIKY is taking off his wings, flying without them for the
first time. He glides toward Bob and embraces him, ecstatic.

SHIKY
Look at me, Bob. No wings!

PROFESSOR HEGRAMET hangs onto the bulkhead, like it’s finally
sinking in. Bob goes to him.

PROFESSOR
I think we made it--

BOB
C’mon, professor, let’s go
take a look, huh?
86.

He just nods back, and follows Bob. DANE is at the controls:

DANE
Starting spherical scan...
rotating ship now--

Bob and the others gather around the window. Not much to see
just yet. It looks UNFOCUSED.

BOB
The stars are blurry.

KLARA
(not liking that)
Turn on the radio.

DANE
Why?

KLARA
Just turn it on--

Dane hits a SWITCH. The cabin fills with EAR-PIERCING NOISE.
Suddenly the ship ROCKS wildly. Everybody fights to hold on:

SHIKY
Gravity wave!

Bob sees something out the porthole and pushes himself back
away from the glass, covering his eyes, like it hurts to see.
He floats through the cabin...

BOB (V.0.)
I saw something that was not
a star, and not a galaxy...
It hurt the eyes, but wasn’t
bright. The hurt was far up
the optic track... The pain
was in the brain itself.

No one else can stay at the window either. But Dane sees it
on the screen, and can’t turn away. Transfixed with terror--

DANE
You killed us, Broadhead...
you killed us.

The Professor crosses himself.

PROFESSOR
This isn’t Zeta Tauri.
(short pause)
Dearest god, we've had it--
87.

EXT. A BLACK HOLE -- SPACE

The HEECHEE SHIP tumbles inexorably toward the BLACK HOLE
sucking in everything around it, a dimly-glowing mass of pale
blue light, mottled, immense, and terrifying. We pull back
until their frail ship is nothing but an INSIGNIFICANT SPECK.

PROFESSOR (V.0.)
That thing is a black hole!

INT. HEECHEE SHIP -- SPACE

BOB, KLARA, PROFESSOR HEGRAMET, SHIKY, and DANE contemplate
their fast-approaching death--

SHIKY
It will suck us in?

PROFESSOR
Not even light can escape its
gravitational pull.

KLARA
How long?

PROFESSOR
Once we cross the blue event
horizon, escape to the outside
will be impossible.

KLARA
Take a guess.

PROFESSOR
Five minutes?

SHIKY
We need to fire the rockets--

DANE
Forget it. It would take two
ships, probably more.

Bob has been floating in the cabin listening to all this, or
not listening, it’s difficult to say. Suddenly he speaks up:

BOB
We have two ships...

Everyone looks at him. Pause.
88.

KLARA
We power the lander, back it
up against the hull, strap it
in place and blow everything
we've got.... It plummets
toward the hole, and we sail
free in the command module--

DANE
You left out the part where
we're splattered into jelly.
PROFESSOR
I believe that omission was
intentional.
SHIKY
Friends, I think we can kill
ourselves easily enough, but
can we do it in five minutes?
cur TO:
INT. SHIP’S AIRLOCK -- SPACE

BOB raises the bubble of his SPACESUIT and sets it in place.
PROFESSOR HEGRAMET, wearing his own suit, secures the seals--

They share a grim look through their visors and just BREATHE.

KLARA floats inside the module, spins, and quickly positions

herself in front of the controls. She flips the SWITCHES all

around her in rapid succession, and the lander COMES TO LIFE.

DANE nervously slips on a HEADSET, and positions the mike.
He glances at the ship’s clock:

The jets abruptly FIRE. The LANDER moves away from the ship.

SHIKY maneuvers through a claustrophobic maze of PIPES AND
SWITCHES, gliding over, under, and all around, flipping
toggles and changing settings--

cur TO:
EXT. HEECHEE SHIP -- SPACE

BOB opens the exterior HATCH and pulls himself half-way out
of the ship, stopping to stare:

BOB’S P.O.V. The BLACK HOLE blocks out even the stars,
consuming the universe like an immense horrible gaping mouth.

Bob pulls his legs free. PROFESSOR HEGRAMET sticks his head
through the hatch, and just like Bob did, reacts to the view.

THE LANDER rises up above the artificial horizon created by
the vessel, maneuvering JETS FIRE, and it gracefully ROTATES.

Bob grabs for a handhold and begins to crawl across the hull.
cur TO:
INT. LANDING MODULE -- SPACE

KLARA works the control stick, backing up the lander. The
two halves of the ship BUMP and

Three minutes--

BOB and PROFESSOR HEGRAMET attach a MOUNTING STRAP designed
to hold the lander in position.

INT. COMMAND MODULE -- SPACE

DANE shoves loose EQUIPMENT into the storage BINS. The ship
rocks wildly from another GRAVITY WAVE and he holds on tight.

curt TO:
EXT. HEECHEE SHIP -- SPACE

The ship rolls and BOB SLIDES ACROSS THE HULL, looking for a
hand-hold. He starts to slip off as his fingers find a grip.

Bob holds onto the ship with his legs hanging over the side--
He pulls himself back onto the hull, and looks for PROFESSOR
HEGRAMET. The old man is all right but too exhausted to go
on. He gestures weakly. Bob nods and starts crawling again.
cur TO:
INT. LANDING MODULE -- SPACE
KLARA fights the alien controls, trying to steady the lander.

BOB struggles to snap the LAST STRAP into place, his face a
mix of anger and determination. He forces the strap down and

DANE’S VOICE

KLARA hurries to unlock the HATCH. Finally, the seal gives
way. SHIKY floats into the lander. They quickly go to work.

DANE moves back to the main control panel. Checks the clock.

DANE
One minute thirty seconds--

curt TO:

INT. LANDING MODULE -- SPACE

SHIKY flips a last switch. He shares an ominous look with
KLARA, and sails out the hatch.

A moment later BOB sticks his head inside the lander. He’s
still wearing his spacesuit, and so they have to talk loudly:

BOB
Time to go.

KLARA
I have to finish wiring
for the remote ignition.

BOB
I’1l do it.

Klara pushes off the bulkhead and floats to Bob. Before he
can speak again, she bends close and kisses his space helmet.
The kiss leaves an IMPRINT OF HER LIPS on his helmet bubble--

KLARA
You can’t in that suit--
Get up top, and be ready
to light this candle...
I‘’1l be right behind you.

DANE’S VOICE
One minute--

Bob doesn’t like going, but there’s no time. He gives her a
confident smile and pushes off.

Klara watches him go for a second and then gets back to work.

curt TO:

INT. COMMAND MODULE -- SPACE
BOB pulls himself up the ladder. Enters the command module--

PROFESSOR HEGRAMET struggles with a makeshift ROPE, strapping
himself to a bulkhead. SHIKY has already slipped into his

own LEGLESS SPACESUIT and is doing the same. DANE pushes off
toward his SUIT, just starting to get in when Bob approaches.

BOB
Klara’s right behind me...
92.

Dane looks at him. Like he knows something Bob doesn’t know.

DANE
Thirty seconds--

BOB
Where’s the remote trigger?

Bob helps the Professor tie himself to the bulkhead. Dane
wishes Bob would just go away. Against his better judgement:

DANE
There wasn’t time to rig a
remote, Broadhead.

Bob looks into Dane’s eyes, and suddenly, he knows the truth.
He turns and lunges for the ladder, clumsy in his spacesuit.
We hear the others yell “BOB!” He takes the rungs too fast,
but doesn’t care, slipping and crashing hard into the floor--

BOB'S P.O.V. Through the bubble of his space helmet, Bob
sees KLARA still inside the lander SWINGING THE HATCH CLOSED.

BOB
KLARA!

Bob pushes off toward the hatch, floating too slow. We hear
his tortured BREATHING inside the suit, and Dane’s countdown:

DANE’S VOICE
Ten seconds...nine...eight...

Bob reaches the hatch and grabs at the lever with his clumsy
gloves. Can’t get a firm grip. When he does, it won’t turn.

DANE’S VOICE
«..seven...six...five... Oh,
to hell with it.
Bob makes a fist and POUNDS on the hatch, AGAIN and AGAIN and

Back on the upper level, Dane stops counting and holds on,
trying not to sound terrified:

DANE
If I die, drinks are on me!

Bob is thrown hard against the bulkhead. He opens his mouth
to scream in protest, and doesn’t stop, but no one hears him
over the ROAR OF THE ROCKETS--

curt TO:
93.

EXT. HEECHEE SHIP -- SPACE

The Heechee ship BLASTS APART. The LANDER plummets wildly
toward the BLACK HOLE while the COMMAND MODULE rockets away--

curt TO:
INT. LANDING MODULE -- SPACE

KLARA holds onto the control stick, strapped into position,
fighting the gravitational forces. She begins to SCREAM and

cur TO:
EXT. THE BLACK HOLE -- SPACE
The LANDER crosses the EVENT HORIZON -- and is suddenly GONE.
cur TO:
INT. COMMAND MODULE -- SPACE

BOB fights to stay conscious, but the acceleration is too
much. He passes out, and mercifully, the screen goes BLACK.

INT. COMMAND MODULE -- LATER
BOB opens his eyes. Groggy--

BOB’S P.O.V. The ship looks very different, darker, possibly
damaged. Juts a few red EMERGENCY LIGHTS. The whole thing
seems to be spinning oddly, or maybe Bob is spinning. The
imprint of Klara’s LIPS is still visible on the clear bubble.

Bob floats free inside of the ship. He reaches out, grabs
for the nearest metal rung, and pulls his body up the ladder.

Bob forces an emergency HATCH and rises into the cabin. SEES
PERFECT SPHERICAL DROPS OF BLOOD floating through the air and

He follows the trail to DANE, drifting as far as the ROPE
around him allows, hull SHRAPNEL sticking out of his suit....

Bob hears a GROAN over his radio and pushes across the cabin.
SHIKY is still strapped to a bulkhead, very weak. But alive:
SHIKY
Bob... I am happy to see you.

Dane is dead. The professor
was blown outside...
94,

Bob gently nods to Shiky. He turns around. There is a
makeshift rope tied to the interior acting as a TETHER LINE--

Bob’s eyes follow the rope across the cabin, through a JAGGED
HOLE in the side of the hull, and all the way out into space.

EXT. HEECHEE SHIP -- SPACE

BOB pulls himself across open space along the TETHER LINE
stretching from the hole in the ship to the fragile body of
PROFESSOR HEGRAMET, spinning slowly at the end of the rope...

Bob reaches the body. What he sees takes Bob by surprise.
The Professor is smiling wide:

PROFESSOR
(with difficulty)
Thank you, Bob. Thank you.

BOB
For what?

PROFESSOR
For making my last day the
greatest...

His face slackens and, just like that, the old man is DEAD.
Bob can’t believe he’s gone...

Then his eyes move slowly down the length of the Professor's
arm, from his shoulder to his elbow, continuing on to that
thick, clumsy spacesuit glove.

Professor Hegramet died POINTING HIS FINGER at something and

Bob turns his head, peeking out the side of his helmet, like
he’s in awe. We notice the REFLECTION in the Professor’s
helmet visor. Something big--

ANOTHER HEECHEE SHIP blocks out the stars directly above Bob.
It is similar to the ships we’ve come to know, but much
larger -- and looks BRAND NEW.

Even more astounding is the actual HEECHEE floating in space.
Bob immediately begins to breathe faster. That’s all we hear
as he drifts closer and closer to the Heechee , just his
increasingly rapid BREATHING--

The Heechee is wearing a SPACESUIT of its own, so we can’t
see the alien body; but it has TWO LEGS, bending outward like
95.

an insect. There are TWO ARMS high on the torso, which is
more elongated than ours, and MORE ARMS lower, though these
may simply be mechanical and part of the suit. The gloves
are made for way TOO MANY FINGERS than we’ll ever be used to.

The space helmet is not so different really, and hides most
of the head and face. But there is no mistaking the alien
nature of the EYES watching Bob, eyes that he’s seen before--

The Heechee does nothing. Just floats there, very patiently.

Bob stares through his helmet visor. It is beginning to FOG
from his hyperventilating and

Then he seems to have an idea.

Bob reaches one of his gloved hands into a large POCKET on
the side of his spacesuit. It takes a second, but finally he
finds what he’s searching for.

Bob holds up that weird HEECHEE SCREWDRIVER -- and throws it.

The screwdriver tumbles slowly across the short distance
between them. For a moment, it seems as if the alien is not
going to react. Doesn’t care.

At the last second the Heechee extends its hand. Catches it.

MALE VOICE
Mr. Broadhead, what compelled
you to toss the so-called
“screwdriver” to the Heechee?

BOB (V.0.)
I don’t know.

MALE VOICE
Did you believe the alien in
front of you was the actual
Heechee to which this object
originally belonged?

Bob and the Heechee look at one another in the void of space.

MALE VOICE
Perhaps you interpreted your
experiences as some form of
elaborate “test” -- one that
would successfully conclude
only by returning the object?

BOB (V.0.)
I already said, I don’t know.
96.

CLOSE-UP of BOB watching the Heechee. From the REFLECTION in
his visor, we can see the alien is making elaborate arm and
hand movements. SOME KIND OF SIGN LANGUAGE. Bob reaches up
and touches a tiny CAMERA mounted on the side of his helmet--

MALE VOICE
I see. And that’s when the
alien began gesturing at you.

INT. DEBRIEFING ROOM -- DAY

BOB finds himself in the same debriefing room, sitting at the
same table...but this time facing the NEW ASSISTANT DIRECTOR.

NEW A.D.

What we can see on the tape
before your camera gave out
suggests the movements were
intended as a method of

communication; but you have
no specific recollection of
any gestures the alien used?

Bob just shakes his head. He really doesn’t want to be here.

NEW A.D.
That is unfortunate. Still,
one can expect no more under
the circumstances. And it
doesn’t detract an iota from
your great achievement, and
contribution to the future--

The Assistant Director slides over an official-looking PAPER:

NEW A.D.
This is your copy of a memo
authorizing payment of five
hundred million dollars to
you, and another payment of
same to your fellow crewman,
Shikitei Bakin.

He really seems happy for Bob.

NEW A.D. (CONT'D)
I hear that they’re planning
an old-fashioned ticker-tape
parade for you two back home
--just like they did for the
first man on the moon!
97.

BOB
When can I ship out again?

The New Assistant Director nods his head too long, like he
doesn’t know how to respond:

NEW A.D.
Bob... May I call you Bob?
You’re a hero now. There
are so many meaningful ways
you can contribute to the
program, public appearances,
speaking engagements--

BOB
So I’m grounded.

The Assistant Director reaches over. Turns off the RECORDER.

NEW A.D.
She is not dead, you know....
Bob, when your ship returned
to Gateway, you were almost a
year overdue. We had written
you off. That’s because you
were near the event horizon--
you do understand about time
dilation inside a black hole,
don’t you? What seemed like
only fifteen minutes to you
and your crew was to the rest
of us over three hundred and
fifty days... Any closer to
the hole and fifteen minutes
would have turned out to be a
decade, or a century -- and
that is what’s happening to
Klara Moynlin right now. You
did not cause her death. She
is still alive, still falling
toward the black hole -- and
she always will be. You see?

Bob just stares at him until:
BOB
Is that supposed to make me
feel better...
And he checks the NAMEPLATE--

BOB (CONT’D)
..-Mr. Sebastian?
98.

NEW A.D.
I’m just trying to--

BOB
For the rest of my life the
woman I love will be stuck
in amber. 1’11 grow old and
try to forget... and Klara
will be up there, terrified,
alone, falling toward that
hole until the end of time?

The New Assistant Director tries to say something again, but
Bob keeps going, with increasing intensity. He frightens us:

BOB (CONT’D)
I killed her and I’m still
killing her. For the rest
of my life, I’1l be killing
her. Do you have anything
else you want to say to me,
you stupid little man?!

INT. GATEWAY CORRIDOR -- DAY

The door opens and a SECURITY GUARD peeks out. BOB waits in
the shadows wearing a HOODED PONCHO to help conceal his face.

Down the hall a CROWD has gathered around SHIKY, who hovers
slightly above them, WINGS flapping as he signs an AUTOGRAPH.

A REPORTER thrusts her mike:

REPORTER
With all that money, are you
going to buy yourself a pair
of prosthetic legs?

Shiky hands the slip of paper to the owner and signs ANOTHER.

SHIKY
Then I would not be a beauti-
ful butterfly!

As the crowd LAUGHS and yells MORE QUESTIONS, the security
guard leads Bob the other way. Still they don’t make it far
before a WOMAN turns around, sees them, and quickly realizes:

WOMAN
THERE HE IS--
99.

INT. GATEWAY ELEVATOR -- DAY

BOB and the SECURITY GUARD run into an elevator. They watch
the CROWD RUSH TOWARD THEM, waving their arms and SHOUTING,
until the doors slide shut and

BOB
What now?

GUARD
My orders are to escort you
to the Earth shuttle, and to
prevent you from approaching
a Heechee vessel.

Bob nods his head. He understands. But something is on his
mind. He turns to the guard and offers him a friendly smile.

INT. MACKLEN MEMORIAL -- DAY

BOB stands on a familiar stone floor COVERED IN PLEXIGLASS to
protect the fatalistic message roughly scratched in the rock,
“SYLVESTER MACKLEN WAS HERE”--

Bob reads the words on the floor. He seems thoughtful. The
SECURITY GUARD hangs back, and just lets him have his moment.

VOICE OF GATEWAY
Gateway was discovered by
Sylvester Macklen, a tunnel
rat on Venus, who found an
operable Heechee spacecraft
in a dig, and got inside--

The automated presentation continues in the background, as it
did before, while Bob makes a slow circle around the chamber:

BOB
Just wanted to see it one
more time before I left for
good. Thank you, Charlie.

GUARD
(more relaxed)
I bet there’s going to be a
museum like this dedicated
to you soon, Mr. Broadhead.
First contact with an alien
race. It’s quite exciting--

Bob steps up to a part of the memorial that is roped off from
100.

the rest. Looks at the object on the other side of the line.
The security guard is lost in his own musings now. Asks Bob:

GUARD
I wonder... do the Heechee
think like we do? Do they
love like we do? What are
your thoughts, sir?

He starts to turn back around, and BOB HITS HIM WITH ONE OF
THE POLES used to rope off the display. The guard goes down.

BOB
Sorry, Charlie....

Bob drops the pole and walks over the fallen rope toward that
dusty and unused HEECHEE SHIP.

VOICE OF GATEWAY
The Heechee vessel you see
here is the actual ship Macklen
used to travel to Gateway!

Bob goes to the old hatch. Won’t budge. Finally it gives
way and he begins to climb in.

VOICE OF GATEWAY
No longer functional, here it
sits, a monument to--

Bob SLAMS the hatch closed and

INT. HEECHEE SHIP -- DAY

BOB stands directly in front of the HEECHEE CONTROL PANEL.
By now its appearance is familiar, and yet it remains as
mysterious and unknowable as always: WHEELS and SPOKES,
SPIRAL COLUMNS, LIGHTS and SWITCHES, a nearly dizzying array.

He doesn’t approach the panel right away, as if giving the
thing the respect it deserves.

Then Bob steps forward, raises his arms, and methodically
begins working the controls...

curt TO:
EXT. SPACE -- FLASHBACK

BOB floats inside his SPACESUIT. Watches the alien HEECHEE--
101.

curt TO:
INT. HEECHEE SHIP -- DAY

BOB stands in front of the controls making elaborate arm and
hand movements. Each gesture results in the TURN OF A WHEEL
or the SETTING OF A SPOKE, the FLIP OF A SWITCH and the
activation of another LIGHT. He never stops and never
hesitates, executing an incredibly choreographed routine, one
that no human being can know--

curt TO:
EXT. SPACE -- FLASHBACK

The alien HEECHEE hangs in space, its inhuman eyes staring at
us. The creature MOVES ITS ARMS, working a control panel
that isn’t there, teaching Bob what to do: what wheel to
turn, what spoke to set, what switch to trigger, and when....

curt TO:
INT. HEECHEE SHIP -- DAY

BOB works with increasing confidence. Faster. Still faster.
We continue to CUT BETWEEN BOB AND THE HEECHEE, a human hand
turning alien then back again, the Heechee beginning a
gesture and Bob completing it...and the CONTROL PANEL COMES

ALIVE like never before. This is a Heechee ship the way it
was meant to be -- everything HUMMING, BUZZING, and WHIRRING!

INT. THE MEMORIAL -- DAY
The SECURITY GUARD slowly comes around. He looks. Sees the

HEECHEE SHIP RISING UP off the floor, as if by an invisible
hand, disappearing through a rocky OPENING in the ceiling and

EXT. THE ASTEROID -- DAY

The HEECHEE SHIP rises to the surface of Gateway and assumes
its launch position inside one of the endless hollow CRATERS.

INT. HEECHEE SHIP -- DAY

BOB makes the last adjustment and stands in front of the
gleaming control panel, his arms still in the air, like a
conductor who’s just completed the performance of his career.
102.

curt TO:
EXT. BLACK HOLE -- SPACE

Klara’s LANDER crosses the BLUE EVENT HORIZON, as before, and

INT. THE LANDER -- SPACE

KLARA holds onto the control stick, COMPLETING THE SCREAM we
saw her begin earlier. As soon as it’s done, she feels a
gentle BUMP. Like something just made contact with the ship?

Klara looks dumbfounded. Starts to check the read-outs when
she hears a mundane everyday KNOCK. Someone is at the door--

She turns and looks at the hatch. Again there comes a KNOCK.

Klara can’t believe this, but doesn’t really know what else
to do, so she unstraps herself and floats over to the hatch--

Klara unlocks the bolt, swings open the door, and BOB glides
into the lander with a big smile, wrapping his arms around
her as they drift in the ship:

KLARA
Bob. You had another one
of your ideas--

BOB
Uh-huh.
KLARA
How did you find me?
BOB
With a little help from a
Heechee.
KLARA

We’re inside a black hole!

BOB
I know.

They continue to tumble through the cabin. Bob moves in for
a kiss...but Klara pulls back.

KLARA
Don’t you get it? Every
second we spend inside of
the hole...
103.

BOB
...decades and centuries
are passing by outside--
(short pause)
Will you please kiss me?

Klara looks at him, and when they finally do, it’s well worth
the wait. The kiss goes on for several seconds, seems like
it might end, but then continues for quite a good bit longer.

Eventually they pull apart, but not by much, floating in each
other’s arms, perfectly happy:

KLARA
You have no clue how to
get us out of here...do
you?

BOB
None at all.

Bob and Klara kiss again. We drift away from the two lovers
and leave them to their efforts, sailing out THROUGH THE
SMALL PORTHOLE, until we’re outside the spaceship looking in.

KLARA
Who knew you were such a
romantic fool, Broadhead?

BOB
Sailing into nothingness
with you ‘til the end of
time is a good way to go.

EXT. THE BLACK HOLE -- SPACE
We slowly pull back from the porthole of their HEECHEE SHIP--
BOB
And who knows? Maybe
we'll run into somebody
heading the other way.

There’s something about the way Bob says that. Klara looks
at him, newfound wonder beginning to spread over her face and

Bob and Klara push off toward the small porthole, and just as
they have done countless times before, look out the window...

This black hole isn’t really black-- And not much of a hole.
104.

The space around them is JAM-PACKED WITH PLANETS. No human
being has never laid eyes on such beautiful worlds, and never
so close together. We see large ringed giants and smaller
globes of astounding color. This place is filled with STARS.

And MOONS. And COMETS. NEBULA too. It’s an impossible
collage of awe-inspiring vistas; and if there is a universe-
maker, then this must certainly be where he stores the parts.

HUNDREDS OF HEECHEE STARSHIPS fill the space between worlds,
heading in every direction....

FADE OUT.
