EXT. FOOTSALL FIELD - MORNING

The .morning sun beats down on a hig) school football stadium.
It has a small town feel. Enclosed by a track court, it has
metal bleachers on either side. It is morning but the sun is

already hot and blistering.

A large man, 40's, can be seen walking along the - empty field.
He drinks from a bottle of water. This is COACH WILLIS. A
hard man. Difficult. He stops to fuss with a water
sprinkler head. He jiggles it, tugs on it. Be can't seem to-

get it to work.
COACH WILLIS

Goddammit! .
He pulls.on it same more when something takes his attention.
Something in the brittle grass. He reaches for it, curious,
knocking over his bottle water in the process.

The Coach scoops something up in his hands.

EXT. JEFFERSON HIGH SCHOOL - MORNING - SAME

A picturesque small town school. A building composed of red.
brick and tradition. The perfect representation of

everything good and true in small town life.
A sign sits in front. :

“WELCOME TO JEFFERSON HIGH! HOME OF THE FIGHTING PATRIOTS! “
It is still early and there are but a few people moving
about. An older woman in her 50's, petite, almost frail,
moves through the font doors. This is MRS. OLSON.

illuminated.

It is a big and. vast room lined with rows and rows of.books.
There are many nooks and crannys that host tables and work

cubicles and computers.

Mrs. Olson moves through the library. to the circulation desk.
She plops down her things and then procaeds her morning ao
ritual of opening the library. She moves past a window and
opens the blinds..
MRS. OLSON
“Didn't know how lost I was until I found
you."

Through the window, the Coach can be seen on the football
field nearby. He's still fusses with the sprinkler system.
Mrs. Olson moves on to another set of doors. She unchains
them also. She moves to a set of outdoor exit doars.
Unlocks it, then checks it out. She pushes on the door, It

. COACH WILLIS
It's hot out there. Your water
fountain's the closest.

MRS. OLSON -
Library's not open for another half hour.

COACE WILLIS
I'll just be a second.
The Coach smiles at her. It's a forced smile. He moves past
her. Mrs..Olson closes the door, placing the chain and lock
on the inside handle.
She moves to the thermostat and checks its reading while the

Coach makes his way to the water fountain. He bends down and
begins to guzzle water. His eyes glance over to Mrs. Olson.

MRS. OLSON
(barely audible)
“But you made me feel, oocohhh, you made
me feel...”
Mrs. Olson moves to the circulation desk, when she turns
around she finds the Coach standing right behind her. He's
just a little too close ‘for her. .

He nods again, turning, moving toward the exit door.

She flies backwards, landing with a THUMP on the hard floor.

 

A moment. They all stare at her still body.

Zeke stares at the pen, then at Drake's lifeless body.

He walks over to the body as a pool of blood spreads sickly
from behind her head...

Zeke is at her feet, wondering what to do.

the large container of SKAT. She opens it and pours it out

The Coach's head goes slack. It drops back and his mouth
opens. Feelers sprout forth, lapping up the water. Zeke's
turns to horror.

It is a hideous and sickening sight. He backs up, to the
others. They see it too.

Suddenly more emerge from the Coach's eye sockets, nose and
mouth. Long stingers that slap about the face, thriving in

withdraws two Bic pens. It's better than nothing. He
pockets them when he hears VOICES.

Hurry, Zeke, she's coming.

Zeke hits reverse and begins as the window rolls up--but

Olson manages to thrust her hand in at the last moment--the
glass catches Mrs. Olson's hand, closing on it. Her fingers
get pinched in the window just as the car springs backwards.

Mrs. Olson's fingers are snipped off by the window, dropping
to the floor of the car.

crashing out the windshield and over the hood. She tries to
hang on, but slides off the hood and is crushed under his

tires.

He screams as he realizes he has worms crawling up his legs,
he tears them off of himself and chucks them out the window.

He's driving silently now. Catching his breath. ~

He flashes the light back down at the tire. Miss Harper's
head is there where it wasn't before. It's severed but still
moving from it's neck stump, being pushed along by it's own
means of propulsion. Her face contorts with each movement, an
evil rasp emanating from her slack mouth.

Zeke reaches around with his free hand and gently shifts the
car into REVERSE.

He backs up rough and short, just enough to crack Miss
Harper's head open with a sick POP. The blood and gore streak
out from under the tire, as easily as if he'd crushed a giant

pea.

He slams the car back in drive as he closes the door and
there is Miss Harper's HEADLESS BODY standing in front of
him, lit sickly by the white hot headlights.

He blasts past her as she headlessly watches him scream, past,
her fingers streaking blood across his window as he goes.
Leaving her to wander headless in the night.

Marybeth stands calm and poised. Zeke takes nete.

. ZEKE
Answer me something, Marybeth. Why are
you naked? ”

Marybeth eyes him. She steps more into the light.

MARYBETH
Does it bother you, Zeke? My body...I'm
getting kinda used to it myself. Poor
Marybeth Louise Hutchinson. .She was all
alone. She lost her parents. I
identified with Her completely.

. MARYBETH (cont'd)
Her world had collapsed in Atlanta and
she was looking for a new home. Very
much like me. I really like my new body,
Zeke. Do you like it? You must. You
ruined it for everyone, Zeke. When you
gave me the fake drug test--that was _
sweet of you to bond with me. It was so
typical of your species. So smart but
utterly incompetent. Will it work again,
Zeke? Do you like what you see?

Zeke can't help but stare at Marybeth's breasts as she runs
her hand along them, tracing them sensually. She takes a
step towards him.

ZEKE
You fuckin' stay back.

MARYBETH
Don't you want me, Zeke? I can feel your
hormones pulsating. Even in your worst
moment of fear you can't control them.
They have a life of their own.

Zeke moves back towards Stokely. He looks back te Marybeth
and she's gone.

t

STOKELY
I told you.

 

ZEKE
Let's get the fuck outta here.

STOKELY
Not so fast.

Just then, Stokely rips forward, mouth agape, a worm
protruding from it. Stokely's body lunges forward when Pacey
appears from behind, grabbing her, sending her body slinging
into a wire equipment cage. He leaps on the door, locking
it.

Inside, Stokely goes berserk, her body writhing about, hack
and forth clawing at the cage. Feelers have half sprout all
over her bedy. She looks hideous. >

Zeke turns to Pacey.

PACEY
C'mon. Let's get Marybeth.

You're outta your mind. And I need mine.

ZEKE

No, I'm not taking any fucking chances.

I leave for five minutes and everyone's a
fucking alien. Now if I have to MEN IN
BLACK your ass--you're gonna fucking

sniff this.

They don't have time to waste. Pacey grabs it, sniffs it.

PACEY
Happy?

A moment as Zeke watches him. Closely.
from the other side of the locker..

PACEY (cont'd)
Shit! She's back.

Suddenly, a NOISE

They move down the row of lockers, not seeing the SHADOW
agaisnt the wall. It is Marybeth's SHADOW. But not for
long. The shadow changes shape. It goes from the femimine
figure of a young woman to the hideous grotesque creature in

seconds.

Pacey and Zeke move down a row of lockers when they hear

something moving around them.

ZEKE
Where is it?

PACEY
I don't know.

Pacey turns to look behind him, he's feeling groggy from the

drug.
PACEY (cont'd)

Jesus! I'm fucking seeing two of

everything.

When he turns back around~-Zeke's gone.

PACEY (CONT'D)
Zeke? Zeke?

Pacey moves around the corner of the lockers. He shakes his
head, trying to find sober clarity when... -

ZEKE'S BODY COMES FLYING AT HIM. They go SLAMMING into the
lockers, sliding to the floor. Pacey jumps up to see Zeke's
limp body on the floor. He leans down, checks Zeke out.

PACEY (cont'd)
c'mon, buddy...get up.

Suddenly, a sweet Georgia accent fills the locker room.

MARYBETE
Where are you, Pacey?

Pacey tries to quiet his TERRIFIED BREATHING.

MARYBETH
Poor Pacey. The class wuss. Loser. His
little penis taped to the wall for all
the world to see.

A. SHADOW bounces across Pacey's face. He jumps up and moves
to another row of lockers, leaving Zeke. .

MARYBETH
I can change all that, Pacey. You never
have to be afraid again. Think about it.
A life without fear. A society without
guns and violence and drugs. It'll be a
perfect world. Fearless,

 

She's getting to him. Pacey is losing it. He looks about
madly.
PACEY

But you're afraid. That's why you're
here, isn't it? You didn't want to be

alone anymore, did you?
Silence. He's touched on a truth.

MARYBETH
Please, Pacey. Be my new family.

Her voice is whimsical...sweet.
PACEY -
No. I rather be afraid.

Really? Is that what you want? To go

existence? Let me change all of that.
Le me give you a new life. . -

PACEY
I can take care of my cld one fine, thank
you.

MARYBETH

Then have it your way.

ON PACEY

Pacey listens. He starts out when he sees the Creature's

shadow move against a locker. He falls to his knees, trying j
to hide. Waiting. He watches, in silent horror, as the

Creature's neck elongates and its head rises up and over the

entire row of leckers.

The Thing knows he's there, its eyes pierce him. Pacey looks
up, sees it, then bols, shooting for the locker room door.

Pacey moves down a row of lockers. He sees Zeke's body

slumped in a heap on the floor. He goes to him. Spots the

Bic pen and grabs it when he hears an ENORMOUS MONSTEROUS .
WAIL ECHO through the locker room. Pacey stops in his

tracks, leaning against the equipment cage. Suddenly,

something grabs him from behind.

 

It's Stokely, still trapped in the cage.

STORELY
He's over here.

Pacey tears through the locker room door and into...

INT. GYM - NIGHT - SAME

Pacey comes-bolting out of the locker room door, he doesn't
look back when the locker room door bursts apart at the
Creature's touch.

Pacey bolts, moving across the basketball court. He turns,
to see the Thing slithering across the floor. One of-it's
tentacles SLINGS forward, wrapping itself around Pacey's leg,
reeling him in. Pacey slides across the floor, KICKING and
SCREAMING. He loses the Bic pen as it drops to the floor.
His hands flail about as he tries to recover it. His body
squirms like a hooked fish,..until the Creature stands over

him.

Pacey lies directly underneath the Creature, it's four legs
on every side of him, caging him in. The Creature's head
appears on it's snake-like neck, twisting under and moving
close to Pacey's face. .

The Creature is face to. face with Pacey. It's slimy feelers

slap about, grazing his cheeks. Its mouth opens as two long
worm-like tongues spit out...

Pacey eyes the Creature's torso,..it's belly where the skin
is so translucent, you can see through it. Thousands of
small slugs swim about...some breaking the surface of the
skin, then diving back under like dolphins in the ocean.

Several fall onto Pacey. They disappear inside his clothing.

Pacey finds the Bic pen, he brings it up to the Creature's
eye, but the Creature dodges. Pacey misses. The slugs are
invading Pacey's body. He can feel them. He starts -
SCREAMING and WRITHING about. Pacey rolls away from the
Creature.
Pacey stands upright and runs, picking at the slugs imbedding
z his skin. The Creature charges for Pacey, tearing at

A Pacey eyes the bleachers. He goes for them, diving under
them...hitting the electric lever on the wall as he goes.

KABOOM!

The electric bleachers begin to close...recoiling up within
. each other.

UNDER THE BLEACHERS

Pacey races through the maze of metal that comprises the
underlining of the bleachers.

He sprints, dodging the steel braces as they snap flat around
him. He looks behind him to see...

THE CREATURE | . ~
right behind him, trafficking the folding bleachers as well.

Pacey runs the length of them, trying to get to the other
side before they close completely.

The bleachers are almost completely gone. Space is tight.
Pacey LEAPS in one final jolt of adrenaline. He makes it,

flying..SMASHING into the gym wall.

He turns to see the Thing just as the last bleacher snaps

closed, SMASHING THE CREATURE FLAT. Only it's head escapes,
stretching forth, coming at Pacey, who meets it dead center
with the Bic pen, imbedding it, with warrior force, right in
the Creature's middle eye.

The Creature goes mad, it's head convulsing and shaking. An
unfathomed SCREAM erupting from IT'S mouth.

A long moment as the Creature finally comes to a
still...dead. Pacey looks down, the slugs on his body fall

away. Dead too.

Pacey stares a long hard moment until he's completely
satisfied the Creature is dead.

Then he rises to his feet. He goes racing toward the locker
room.

INT. LOCKER ROOM - SAME

Pacey moves to the equipment cage. He looks down to see
Stokely lying on the floor, unconscious. A dead slug lay at

her nostril.
Pacey unlocks it, moves inside, touches her.

PACEY
Stoke?

Stokely stirs. She's alive.

STOKELY
Jesus, Pacey-~-is it over?

PACEY
Yeah. Are you okay?

STOKELY
I think so. You can't feel them, Pacey.
When they're in you--you can't feel them.
You don't know they're there.
Stokely hugs Pacey. He helps her up when...
A BODY COMES CRASHING AGAINST THE CAGE.

Pacey and Stokely SCREAM in terror. They look up to see
Zeke, in pain, clutching his wounds.

Pacey smiles, happy to see him. They all share a moment,
looking at each other. . .

ZEKE

PACEY
Yeah. It's over. We won.

But how do you know for sure? - In the
book, we didn't win. ° .

ZEKE
I think. it's time to read another kook.

PACEY
Yeah, I'm with him. Change genzes. A
nice Danielle steele or Judith Krantz.

Zeke helps them out of the cage and as they move out of the.
locker room...Stokely stops them.

STOKELY
I had it in me and I didn't know | it. How

would we know?

ZEKE
If you don't know--what dees it matter?

They look at each other. . Intensely. Geke's last words

echoing.
