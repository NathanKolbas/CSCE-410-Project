EXT - SPACE

Planet Earth glows small and distant against a field of
of stars. CAMERA APPROACHES Earth as we DISSOLVE CLOSER:

Earth leoms up, slowly filling the screen. The North
American continent reveals itself as we DISSOLVE CLOSER:

The west coast of the United States rises toward us.
Mountains, rivers, and major cities become distinct as we
DISSOLVE CLOSER through drifting clouds:

EXT - MORGAN CITY - DAY

Morgan City isa small.community, @ modest would-be ski town
in the off season, nestled at the base of a mountain. It's got
its°own high school, and a factory that is grimly hanging on
despite production slowdowns and lay-offs.

VARIOUS ANGLES of the town make us uneasy. The streets seem
deserted...desolate,..

e..a hot, restless breeze blows a tattered newspaper down
Main Street...leaves skitter across the pavement...a wary cat
slinks under parked cars...

...but there are no pecple. Something seems to be terribly
wrong in Morgan City. We soon begin to hear a DISTANT
ROARING...the SOUND OF A CHEERING CROWD.

CUT TO:
EXT ~ HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL FIELD - DAY

MEG PENNY leaps up into frame, a blur of pom-poms and chestnut
hair as she leads the pep squad in a cheer. The banner-waving
crowd is going wild.

Most of the town has turned out for the game. The Morgan High
Hawks are battling the Banning Raccoons in a grueling play-off.

PLAYER'S BENCH

PAUL TYLER and SCOTT JESKEY sit on the bench, battered and
streaked with sweat and dirt, waiting to go back in. Paul is
clean-cut and unassuming, a natural athlete. Scott is small
and something of @ smartass. What he lacks as an athlete, he
makes up for by being obnoxious.

Seott takes a squeeze bottle of water from an ice chest and

rubs it across his forehead. Paul is watching Meq intently as
she goes through her routine.

He looks away, embarrassed that she caughs him looking. Scott
leans in to Paul.

scott
Tim telling you, man, she wants
your bodily fluids. You gotta ask
her out.

PAOL
Isn't she dating Polver?

scoTT
That's going nowhere. The guy's 4
total scrotum, for Chrissakes.
(beat)
It grieves me to see you think so
small. It really does.

PAUL
(defensive)
I'm gonna ask her out.

scott
Bullshit. When?

PAUL
When the time is right. Timing's
everything.

COACH (0.S.}
Offensive line in!

Paul and Scott grab their helmets and rush out onto the field.

ANOTHER ANGLE

The teams take their places at the scrimmage line. They paw
at the ground, glaring at one another, tension mounting as the
Hawks' QUARTERBACK takes his position.

THE QUARTERBACK

Throws @ long pass to Paul.

Running...rcunning...arms stretching up toward the ball. He
leaps high into the air, making a perfect catch in his
cradied arms. Pure poetry.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Out of nowhere, five monstrous guys from the opposing team
slam into him like an express train, driving him out of bounds
to crash onto a table on the sidelines. Cheerleaders scatter
as the table collapses in an explosion of Gatorade,
clipboards, and towels,

The five brutes, in no particular hurry, pick themselves off
of Paul and saunter back onto the field. Paul is left lying in
the wreckage like road-kill. Meg locks down at him, horrified.

PAUL
(wheezing, his wind
knocked out)
Say Meg...do you have any plans
this evening?

CUT TO:
EXT - COUNTRYSIDE - SAME TIME

BRIAN FLAGG eases back in the worn seat of his rebuiit 1958
Indian motorcycle, listening to the DISTANT CHEERING CF THE
FOOTBALL CROWD. Brian is 17, but has a dark, quiet intensity
that makes him seem older than his years. He wears a two-tone
40's thrift store jacket over his T-shirt, worn blue jeans,
crepe-soled rockabilly shoes, and a tiny metal stud in one
ear. Not your standard wardrobe in Morgan City, U.S.A.

There is @ Morgan High book bag strapped to the back of his
bike, He pulls a beer from the bag, pops the top, and takes 4
long sip, contemplating the deep, narrow guliy before him.

The dried-out riverbed was once spanned by a wooden bridge,
but all that cemains is a short section of rotted timbers
extending out inte mid-air,

 

Brian starts the bike, then proceeds

 
ANGLE GN THE WOODS

A grizgied old man emerges from the woods dragging @ plastic
garbage bag bulging with aluminum cans. He is accompanied by
an equally grizzled old dog. The CAN MAN pauses, catching
sight of Brian.

BRIAN

takes a last swig of beer and tosses the can aside. Once
again, @ DISTANT CHEER rises up. He comes to a decision and
guns his bike, heading back across the field.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Brian comes to a stop, skidding around to face the ruin.

THE CAN MAN

He grins toothlessly. Sensing one hell of a floorshow, he
scurries closer and makes himself comfortable on a log.

BRIAN

Unaware of the old man, concentration totally focused on the
jump, He works the throttle, revving the engine higher and
higher.

INSERT ~ FOOTBALL GAME CROWD

The CHEERLEADERS are leading the crowd in a “freight train”
cheer, accelerating the tempo.

BRIAN

The CHEER CONTINUES BUILDING as he works himself up toward
the moment of truth. Then:

CLOSEUP ON Brian's hand gunning the throttle.
CLOSEUP ON his foot jamming the bike into gear.
CLOSEUP ON the rear wheel spraying dirt.

INSERT - FOOTBALL GAME CROWD

A sea of people chanting, their pace speeding up.
BRIAN

accelerating toward the gully, wind whipping through his 4h

 

BRIAN'S POV

The field flashing by as the gorge

 
BRIAN

opens the throttle wide...and suddenly the bike sputters
and coughs, losing speed. He reacts, gunning the engine. It
sputters again.

BRIAN'S POV

Lurching toward the remains of the bridge.

INSERT ~- CROWD - TIGHTER

Chanting faster and faster.

BRIAN

hits the brakes. The bike skids, kicking up dust as it veers
to the side. He digs his heel into the ground, fighting his
momentum as he reaches the lip of the gully...

...f0r an endless moment he just hangs, teetering at the very
edge, fighting for balance...

..ethen both bike and rider go over the side, falling/sliding
down the incline to land in a crumpled heap at the bottom.

INSERT - CROWD

EXPLODING INTO APPLAUSE as the “freight train” climaxes.

GULLY ~ CLOSE ON BRIAN

CHEERING CONTINUES OVER. Brian lies flat on his back in a thin
trickle of muddy water, his battered motorcycle on top of him.
He groans and begins to wriggle out from under the bike.

He now hears @ PAIR OF HANDS CLAPPING and looks up, shielding
nis eyes against the sun.

BRIAN'S POV

The Can Man sits on the lip of the gully above, wheezing
gleefully and applauding,

ANOTHER ANGLE

Brian settles back, sighing. The old man rises and picks up
Brian's discarded beer can, polishing it with his sleeve as if
it were @ great prize. He puts it in the garbage bag with the
other cans, then walks away.

Main Stcest is still deserted, The Tick Tock Diner is a

classic roadside eatery featuring @ garish neon clock sign.
A dusty police cruiser is parked outside.

INT - TICK-TOCK DINER

whe place is almost empty. A ceiling fan turns lazily,
offering little relief from the heat. FRAN HEWITT, the
waitress, serves a pair of TELEPHONE LINEMAN at a booth.

Sitting at the counter is SHERIFF HERS GELLER (40's), a rangy,
soft=spoken man just finishing a burger. He watches Fran as
she goes about her work -- she's got the world-weary look of a
lifer waitress, but is still quite an attractive woman.

Fran steps behind the counter.

HERB
Looks like the game put you out
of business.

FRAN
Don't worry. When they're done

Supposed to be pretty good.

FRAN
That's nice.

HERB
You like country music?

Fran pauses, leveling her gaze at him.

FRAN
Herb...you askin’ me out?

HERB |
Well, yeah...I guess I am.

Slightly flustered, she turns away to write out his check.

FRAN
I don't know. I'm stuck here pretty
late. Gotta make a living, you know.

HERB
{trying to bow out
gracefully)
Yeah. Must be tough tc get away.

Fran shifts her gaze to the plate glass window. Outside, a
HORDE OF HIGH SCHOOL KIDS are descending on the diner.

FRAN
Oh shit.
(hollering into kitchen)
GEORGE! HERE THEY COME!

The teenagers pour in, filling the place with SUDDEN NOISE AND
CHAOS. Herb slides a business card across the counter to her.

HERB
Tf you ever get a little time to
yourself, here's my number down at
the station.

A mob of babbling kids crowd around the counter as she
finishes scribbling Herb's check, tears it off, and hands it
to him. Without another word, she turns to start taking
orders.

Feeling rebuffed, he pulls out his waliet to pay. But when he
looks at the check...

HERB
He grins...then tears off the receipt. He lays a tip on
the counter and leaves.

EXT - MAIN STREET ~ DAY

An old pickup truck pulls to a stop near the diner. Brian hops
out of the back of the truck and waves his thanks as it pulls
away. He starts up the street, but spots Herb exiting the
diner and getting inte his police cruiser.

Brian fades back into a storefront as Herb starts his car. It's
clear Brian would prefer avoiding him.

The cruiser approaches, but instead of gliding past, it comes
to a stop right in front of Brian. Herb rolls the window down.

HERB
Flagg. Congratulations.

BRIAN
For what?

HERB

Hear you got a birthday comin’ up.
No more juvie hall, right?

BRIAN
Riiiight...

HERB
Next time you fuck up, you're in
the majors.

See you around, Flagg.

the cruiser pulls away. Brian watches it go, heaving a low sigh.

He crosses the street toward "MOSS' REPAIR SHOP", a grimy
cinderblock garage.

cur PO:
INT ~ MOSS* GARAGE ~ DAY

MOSS WOOLSEY, @ muscular, middle-aged black man, chews on a
soggy cigar as he works at the engine of a large Snow Cat. On
the Cat's door igs a logo for "INDIAN SUMMIT SKI RESORT." Moss
looks up from his labors as Brian enters, still dusty and
disheveled from his fall.

Moss
You look like hell, man.

BRIAN
It's a fashion statement, Moss.

MOSS
The only statement them clothes got
to make is: "I look like hell.*

BRIAN
My bike's sitting out at Elkins
Grove. Can I borrow your ratchet
set?

MOSS
You kiddin’ me? The Summit‘s got me
overhauling six fuckin’ Skidoos,
three Cats, and two flatbed
snowmakers by Monday.

BRIAN
What's the hurry? Must be ninety
degrees out.

Moss pulls two bottles cf beer from a pile of man-made snow
on the lip of a flatbed snowmaker. He tosses one to Brian.

MOSS
Just Injun summer, boy. Before you
know it, winter'll come tear-assin'
through this town with no apologies.
Fall ain't nothin’ but a rumor
around these parts.

Brian knocks the cap off the beer bottle using the edge of a
steel locker.

BRIAN
Cimon, it barely pissed snow the
last couple of years. The whole
town's ready to fold.

   

(CONTINUED)
MOSS
This year's gonna be different.

Is that right...

MOSS
Take my word. You're gonna wish
your piece of shit excuse for a
motorcycle was one of these sweet
little rigs.

He pats the side of a Snow Cat.

BRIAN
How about the ratchets, Moss?

Moss sighs and turns back to his work.

BRIAN (cont.)
Maybe if I put in some hours for
you over the weekend it'll lighten
things up.

MOSS
There's twelve ratchets in that
set. Twelve. They better all be
there when I get it back.

Brian quickly gathers up the ratchet set, rolling it into its
cloth sleeve and pocketing it.

BRIAN
Thanks, Moss.

MOSS
You ask me, you ought to give that
thing a decent burial and forget
about it.

Brian exits.

CLOSE ANGLE on a low tree stump. A gnarled hand is placing
Brian's discarded beer can in a careful grouping with three
others. ANGLE WIDENS TO REVEAL the Can Man studiously inspec-

ting this arrangement in the waning light. His decrepit shack
stands nearby, the mangy deg lying listlessly on the porch.

  

The Can Man slowly raises his foot. A large rusty iron
is strapped to his book like a Medieval snowshoe. Witt
cry, he stamps down on the stump, flattening the cans.

(CONTINUED }
He lifts his foot to study his handiwork. He chuckles,
ring softly to himself.

CAN MAN
Good ‘un.

He tosses the flattened cans into the large wire basket of an
old scale, which is already half-filled with crushed cans. As
he grabs Lwo fresh cans and sets them on the stump, he pauses,
noticing his dog.

THE BOG

rising to its feet, staring at the sky, growling softly.

THE CAN MAN

starts to hear a HIGH-PITCHED WHINS, GROWING LOUDER. He
jocks up.

THE SKY

The first stars have appeared in the brilliant cobalt-blue
evening sky...but one star seems to be growing steadily larger.

THE CAN MAN

gazing up in wonder as light shines on his face...getting
brighter.

LOW ANGLE - WIDE

The WHINE BECOMES A ROAR and the old man hurls himself to the
ground as a flaming meteorite streaks directly over the cabin.
There is a flash cf light and a DEAFENING BLAST as it crashes
somewhere deep in the woods.

The dog goes crazy and charges off into the forest in the

direction of the crash. The Can Man scrambles to his feet,

hobbling arcund with the skillet still strapped on.

He wrestles the skillet off his foot and starts toward the

woods,..but pauses, turning back. He goes to the porch and

grabs a rusty hand-axe. Now properly armed, he sets out.

The Can Man slowly rises from the undergrowth, his awed
features bathed in an eerie light.

Before him, @ smouldering nine-foot crater casts an unearhtly
glow on the surrounding tangle of trees deep in the forest.

Blue/green flames dance along the crater's rim like faerie
lights, slowly dying out as brackish smoke funnels into the
night sky. Shattered trees trunks and scorched earth mark the
cbject's descent.

The Can Man gathers his courage and approaches the gaping
hole, brandishing his axe. His dog slinks along beside him.

The old man pauses at the rim of the crater, wavering between

cowardice and curiosity. He finally kneals and gazes down into
the hole, shying from the heat and swirling smoke,

Through haze, we see a charred, red-hot sphere buried in the
earth, with a crack down the middle. A sort of fiery, volcanic
soup boils within.

HIS POV

We sense Movement: a strange pulsing just beneath the molten
surface.

THE DOG

THE CAN MAN

grabs a fallen branch and extends it down into the smoking
core of the crater, giving it a tentative poke.

There is a gentle tug on the stick, like the nibble of a
trout.

He slowly pulls the stick out. Clinging to the end of it is a
weird, gelatinous mass about the size of a fist. Its
transparent surface steams and sparkles in the crater's glow.

Though the stick is pointed down, the mass does not drip off.
Instead, it seems to flex and draw into itself.

The old man steps back, uttering a soft gasp of wonder. He
turns the stick this way and that, admiring his discovery,
fascinated.

CLOSEUP - HIS HAND

Suddenly, the mass shoots up the length of the stick like a
striking cobra, engulfing his hand to the wrist.

around, trying to identify the noise.

But there is now only silence, He must have imagined it. He
goes back to work.

More RUSTLING. The CRACK OF A TWIG. Brian stands up and peers
into the darkness, holding his breath as he listens.

He slips the ratchet into his back pocket, clicks the
motoreycle's headlight on, and pans it across the open field.

BRIAN'S POV

The field and the surrounding forest in the beam of his
headlight. Nothing seems to be stirring.

He shakes off the feeling. Probably a small animal or
something. He clicks the headlight off and turns back to

his bike --

REVERSE ANGLE

Brian finds himself looking directly into the wild, sunken
eyes of the Can Man as he lets out a BLOODCURDLING SCREAM and

The Can Man falls to his knees, swinging the axe down onto his
own wrist.

BRIAN

can’t believe what he's seeing.

ANOTHER ANGLE

The Can Man, still SCREAMING, trying to hack through his
wrist. Brian leaps forward and catches the axe, wrestling it

out of the cid man's grip. He hurls it away into the brush.

The Can Man makes a frantic lunge after it, but Brian grabs
him by the arm and spins him back around.

flesh. The organism is no longer perfectly clear -- it has

The axe wounds have already been engulfed by the ravenous
slime. Not a drop of blood ‘has escaped.

Hey, I'm not the one who bounced
him off my car, pal.

The Blob contracts around its flailing prey as it drags him
across the room toward an open window.

Paul desperately reaches out toward Meg with one arm that has
remained free of the writhing crganism.

She grabs his hand, pulling for all she's worth, getting

on one side, a grill with a serving window that looks out onto
the dining area. On the other, a long stainless steel counter
with a large industrial sink. A hallway leads to other rooms
in the back: office, stock rooms, walk-in freezer, etc.
Fran enters and sets a tray of dirty dishes on the counter. As
she turns to go, she hears an ugly GURGLING SOUND from the
stainless steel sink. She peers into the basin.
HER POV - THE SINK

The drain is backing up. Pilthy water wells up into the basin
and greasy bubbles break the surface.

FRAN

She sighs, then pulls a plunger from below the sink. She is
about to attack the drain when George enters and sees her.

GEORGE
Here, I'll get that.

He confiscates the plunger. Fran grins at his chivalry.

FRAN
Hey, knock yourself out.

She exits. George puts the plunger in the sink, furiously
working it up and down. The drain remains clogged. He leans
down, inspecting the cily surface cf the water...

...it ripples as several bubbles gurgle up ominously.

George rolls up his sleeve and reluctantly sticks his hand
down the drain, grimacing with disgust. His arm disappears up
to the elbow, He feels around for a long beat...

Nothing.

(CONTINUED)
 

He withdraws his arm and towels it off with a dish rag, eyeing
the stubborn drain with irritation.

 

He leans over the sink, peering straight down into the clogged
drain. Beat.

A slimy red coil shoots up into his face like a monstrous
frog's tongue, yanking him head-first down into the sink with
unbelievable force.

INT ~ DINER
Brian and Meg are at their booth. He is speaking softly.

Look, even if I were convinced, I'm
the wrong guy to back you up. I'm

Fran approaches and sets two plates in front of them, each
containing a piece of apple pie. Brian locks up at her.

BRIAN
The sandwich busted me.

PRAN
On the house. Last two pieces. Eat
up or I chuck ‘em in the garbage.
BRIAN
{accepts with a grin)
I‘m not proud.

She clears away the dirty sandwich dishes and heads back
toward the kitchen.

INT - KITCHEN

Fran enters and freezes in horror, unable co comprehend the
sight before her:

THE SINK
George's body flops arcund in wild convulsions as the Blob
rapidly dissolves him, sucking him down the drain like a
snake wolfing down a rat. His head and neck have already
vanished entirely.

An ear-spiitting SCREAM from the kitchen. Brian leaps up.
BRIAN

He runs to the xitchen, Meg at his heels.

INT - KITCHEN

Brian and Meg rush in and freeze, dumbfounded.

George is thrashing and jerking spasmodically as the Blob
continues dragging him down the drain. His upper torso is
entirely gone ~~ the sink starts to buckle, pipes GROANING.

Hysterical, Fran starts forward as if to help.

BRIAN
DON'T TOUCH IT!

George's legs churning wildly about, feet swelling from the
incredible pressure --

~~ a shoe explodes across the room in a spray of blood --

-~ then the legs get sucked away with lightning speed, toes
bursting in sequence.

George is gone.
WIDE ANGLE

A long, breathless hush. Brian and Meg on one side of the room,
Fran huddled on the other. Nobody moves. Nobody breathes.

Suddenly, the Blob shoots straight up out cf the drain in a
surging column of slime and forms on the ceiling in the space
of a heartbeat. It clings upside down, a pulsating, blistering,
oozing vision from a nightmare.

BRIAN

Realizing Fran is cornered on her side of the room, he reaches
out to her.

BRIAN
FRAN! COME ON!

But the Blob reacts, shooting tendrils of slime, cutting him
off, He leaps back, stumbling into Meg.

The Blob goes after Brian, surging blindly through the overhead
florescents, smashing them, twisting the electrical conduits
right out of the wall in an explosion of plaster and 4a SCREECH
of twisting metal. An electrical surge blows out every light

in the diner with a shower of sparks...

BRIAN AND MEG

They careen from the kitchen with the Blob at their heels,
blundering through the dark into the back hallway. Electrical
sparks hiss and dance from exploded light fixtures. Brian
crashes against the back deer, but it doesn't budge.

BRIAN
It's locked!

The Blob closes in, a nightmarish silhouette undulating down
the wall after them. Meg grabs Brian and drags him into the
large walk-in freeger.

INT = FREEZER

They slam the door shut and stumble to the far end of the

freezer, Slipping on ice. They cringe back amidst hanging

meat, breath coming in puffs of vapor, eyes riveted on the
freezer door...

.eeas it slowly bulges inward with an ominous GROAN. Brian and
Meg huddle closer, gripping each other tightly.

The door starts to buckle. The bottom molding pops off and
shoots across the room...Meg lets out a sob of terror...a

groping flap of slime slithers in under the door, probing

across the frozen floor...

But then, inexplicably, the appendage wavers...and begins to
reverse itself, sucking back under the door.

Brian and Meg stare at the door, not quite believing the
attack has stopped.

CUT TO:
INT - DINER

Fran is rattling the front door. It's locked. She's trapped
inside. She turns back, locking around frantically, and sees a
side window that looks cut into the alley. She hurries over
and tries tc open it. It's hopelessly stuck. She strains
against it, but it’s no use.

Suddeniy, she hears a SOUND behind her in the darkness: a
chair scraping across the floor. She whirls around, breath
eaught in her throat, gazing into the darkness.

HER POV
The diner is shadowy, dark, still...but then the tables and
chairs at the rear of the diner begin moving slowly, drifting

coward her as if caught in a gentle swell. A huge unseen
presence is beneath them, coming her way.

Whimpering with panic, she picks up the nearest chair and
hurls it through the window in an explosion of glass.

Pean clambers out the window, scraping her knees and elbows
bloody as she sends garbage cans clattering in all directions.
A scruffy alley cat leaps out, YOWLING.

At the far end of the alley stands a lone phone booth in a
pool of light.

Fran scrambles to her feet and runs up the length of the alley
to the booth -~ then pauses, looking back.

HER POV - THE ALLEY

Empty and still. There is no sign of the creature.

FRAN

Throws herself into the booth, frantically digs out the
business card Sheriff Geller gave her earlier that day, and
fumbles 4 quarter into the phone. She waits for a dial
cone...but doesn't get one.

She starts pounding the cut-off switch to get her quarter
back, constantly looking back to make sure she isn't being
pursued.

She jumps, hearing a distant CRASH OF GLASS...and a SCREAM
that ends abruptly.

looks around -- still no sign of the Blob.

She finally gets a tone and begins to dial...as hideous
feelers of blood-red slime begin to undulate down the outside
of the phone booth from above, sucking along the glass like a
leech's underbelly.

She sees the Blob and SCREAMS, dropping the phone as the
creature slowly engulfs the entire booth. She wedges her leg
against the door and grabs the dangling receiver as:

RECORDED VOICE (filtered)
We're sorry, your call cannot be
completed as dialed. Please hang up

Fighting back panic, Fran keeps the’door jammed shut as she
re-deposits the quarter. She dials with shaking fingers,
breath coming in short bursts of stark terror as the booth is
totally submerged in the dim red light filtering through the
creature. The line finally starts RINGING at the other end.

The pooth's metal structure GROANS like a sinking ship as the
Blob applies pressure. Tiny red bulges of slime appear along
the joints. RINGING CONTINUES.

Meg shakes her head -- she has no idea, They proceed @ short

suddenly, whipping the foliage into a frenzy. They turn to
run, but the light sweeps over them, churning light and shadow

the half-dissolved corpse of the sergeant. They SCREAM,
fighting with it. It bobs away, sinking out of sight.

They spiash out of the water and keep running, disappearing
into a tunnel. Brian is now limping on an injured leg.

ANOTHER ANGLE
They run right into Soldier #1 as he pops from the darkness,

scaring the hell out of them. His faceplate is cracked open
down the middle, his face is streaked with blood.

Sarge...
BRIAN

How do we get out of here?

SOLDIER #1
They were trying to scream...inside
it...trying to scream...

Brian grabs the front of his suit and shakes him violently,
bashing him back against the wall.

BRIAN
YOU GOTTA SHOW US THE WAY OUT!

The soldier cringes away, almost weeping with pain. His arm
flops at an unnatural angle -~- it's broken. Shattered bone
sticks through the plastic of the suit. Brian winces.

BRIAN
Oh Jesus.

MEG
Brian!

He turns to her. She gestures back toward the chamber.
THEIR POV

Just beyond the mouth of the tunnel, the Blob is pouring back
into the chamber, seeking them. ~

They race through tunnels, twisting and turning. A VOICE comes
from the soldier's walkie-taikie, trying to raise somebody.

VOICE (filtered)
Baker Team! Baker Team! What the
hell's going on down there?
The soldier doesn't bother answering. Just keeps running.
ANOTHER ANGLE

They come to a vertical shaft that leads straight up to an
open manhole. Brian peers up the shaft.

BRIAN
We're coming up!

LOOKING UP THE SHAFT

Plastic-suited men are peering down the manhole, shining
lights. Trimble and Hargis appear.

CLOSER ~ TRIMBLE ~ LOW ANGLE
He sees Brian. Beat.

TRIMBLE
Close the manhole.

The men near him react. Hargis turns to him angrily.

HARGIS
That's my man down there.

BRIAN

Brian Slides back to the bottom of the ladder as the soldier
pleads frantically into his walkie-talkie.

SOLDIER #1
Colonel, you can't! That thing’s
down here with us!

Brian grabs the walkie from him.

BRIAN
Trimble? You hear me?

Talk to me, man!
SOLDIER
The water's rising...it's coming

for us...

Brian and Meg look down. The water level is indeed inching up
around their ankles. The soldier leans against the wall and
slides to the floor, weeping.

Brian turns hopelessly to Meg. All is lost. There is a long
moment of silence between them. Then, softly:

MEG
I thought you were gonna look
after yourself.

BRIAN
I guess I blew it, huh?

I'm sorry, Meg. I really am.

A handheld grenade launcher is strapped to his belt. The
words -"Explosive Projectile -~ Caution: Blowback" are
stenciled along the side.

He looks up at her, a grin slowly spreading. He gives her a
fast hard kiss on the mouth that rocks her back on her feet,
then stoops down and rips the grenade launcher off the soldier.

BRIAN

The soldier reaches up with his good hand and yanks a cocking
lever back.

SOLDIER

Trimble lies dazed, GROANING. Around him, Hargis and his men
are Staggering to their feet. Deputy Briggs runs up, trailed
by townspeople.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Brian crawls from the smoking manhole, followed by Meg and the
soldier. Brian grabs a fallen M-16 and swings it in Trimble's
direction, murder in his eye.

Briggs draws his service revolver and levels it at Brian.

BRIGGS
Flagg! Drop it!

BRIAN
It's a lie! All of it!

BRIGGS
I said put it down! I'll blow you
out of your shoes, boy!

TRIMBLE

Picking himself up, standing on shaky legs, seeing the M-16 in
Brian's grip.

TRIMBLE
(to Hargis)
Shoot him!

Hargis levels his M-16, but hesitates. He's a soldier sworn to
obey, but this thing is spiraling out of reason.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Briggs swings his revolver toward Trimble and Hargis, stunned
by the order to shoot. Other soldiers CLICK~CLACK their
weapons. Brian keeps his M-16 on Trimble. A tense stand-off.

BRIGGS
All right, hold it. Everybody just
put your guns down.

TRIMBLE
He's infected! Contagious! He'll
spread a plague through this town
and kill you all!

The townspeople GASP, drawing back. Briggs swings his revoiver
back to Brian and steps away apprehensively.

Listen to me, Briggsi Think for a

TRIMBLE
Shoot him! That is a direct order!

How'd they get here so quickly?
How'd they even know to come?

TRIMBLE
SHOOT, DAMN IT! SHOOOOT!

BRIAN
I'll tell you how! That "meteor"
is manmade! It's some kind of germ
warfare test! They fucked up!
Trimble hurls himself at Hargis and wrestles the M-16 out of
his hands. He fumbles with the slide, cocking it. Briggs
swivels his gun back at Trimble.

BRIGGS
Don't try it!
Trimble opens fire, his aim wild. Brian hurls Meg to the
ground, covering her. Briggs is winged and spins to the
ground, revolver discharging into the air.

Suddenly, a tendril of slime shoots out of the manhole and
flails through the air.

CLOSEUP ~- TRIMBLE'S FEET

The slime THWACKS around his ankles like a bullwhip and --
WIDER ANGLE

-- yanks him clean off his feet. He smacks the ground facedown
and is dragged back across the pavement toward the manhole,

tangled in the strap of the M-16, struggling and SCREAMING --

He is drawn into the manhole, but gets stuck, the M-16
wedged under his arms,

CLOSER ~ TRIMBLE

SCREAMING and SCREAMING, jerking violently from below, arms
flopping convulsively.

His suit begins to swell from within. The Blob appears inside
his helmet, oozing up inside his faceplate.

His eyes bulge, hellishly aware...then his face is entirely
engulfed in slime.

The M-16’s strap breaks and Trimble is sucked away in the
blink of an eye.

FAVORING HARGIS

He and his men are staring at he manhole, aghast. Hargis rips
his helmet off and hurls it to the ground, finally fed up. He
grabs an M-16 from one of his men.

HARGIS
Let's scrag that thing.

He and several of his men step forward and furiously empty
their weapons down the manhole, the ROAR OF GUNFIRE DEAFENING.

HARGIS (cont.)
. Satchel charge! Short fuse!

Another soldier pulls the ripcord of a satchel charge the size
of a phone book and tosses it down the hole. The men step
away. Beat. An EXPLOSION blows a tongue of flame up out of

the hole, followed by drifting smoke. All is still.

HARGIS (cont.)
Chew on that, slimeball.

Then the concrete beneath their feet begins to tremble...
subtly at first, then more violently. Hargis looks around,
bewildered.

HARGIS (cont. )
What's happening...

BRIAN
(softly)
I think you pissed it off.

Suddenly the Blob shoots straight up out of the manhole into
the night sky, shattering the surrounding concrete, sucking
soldiers up with it.

Hargis and his men are snagged like flies on flypaper, kicking
and screaming as they rise on the impossibly huge pillar of
slime.

HARGIS
is sticking out of the Blob from the waist up, M-16 blazing,
screaming in rage as he rides the thing up into the air.

Defiant to the end, he rips pins from the grenades strapped
across his chest as he is sucked into the morass.

Like @ gigantic whale surfacing, the Blob slams back down,
buckling the concrete of the street, tilting streetlamps at
crazy angles. Some short out, others flicker wildly.

Hargis' grenades go off inside the creature in rapid
succession, lighting up the beast from within...to no effect,

BRIAN AND MEG

stumble to solid ground at the edge of the street.

MASTER SHOT

In the erratic flickering of ruined streetlights, we see the
blood-red mountain of noxious slime thunder after the fleeing
people, its flailing tendrils snaring a half dozen victims.

A sporadic CHATTER OF GUNFIRE comes from the handful of
remaining soldiers as frantic civilians race back to the town
hall.

BRIGGS

Clutching his bleeding side. Shouting to the panicking crowd.

BRIGGS
Back! Everybody back!

Reverend Meeker is standing nearby, transfixed by the sight of
the creature, buffeted by running people.

REV. MEEKER
My God. The Day is come.

He starts up the street toward the Blob as if experiencing a
religious vision. Horrified, Briggs calls after him.

Soidier #1 steps into the path of the rolling monstrosity and
lets loose a WHOOSHING stream of liquid fire. The flames
enguif the Blob, trailing oily black smoke.

soldier's back EXPLODE in a fireball, obliterating him.

Meg looks around in disbelief. Briggs hauls Meeker upright and
drags him toward the town hall. Meg covers their retreat,
blasting COZ at the Blob.

TOWN HALL

Meg and Briggs drag Meeker up the steps, running with the last
of the crowd.

INT - TOWN HALL - REVERSE ANGLE

They rush in with the Blob surging up the steps right behind
them and slam the sturdy main doors.

There is a JARRING IMPACT as the Blob hits the doors...but
they hold. Living slime burrows in through the cracks, but Meg
blasts it back with jets of CO2 gas.

Briggs turns to the people around him: Moss, Meg's family,
and many others.

BRIGGS

Pull all the CO2 you can find!
We can hold it off!

A PANICKING MAN near‘the back of the hall hollers at Briggs:

MAN
You hold it off! We're getting out!

A number of people MURMUR in angry agreement as the man rushes
to a window and starts struggling to open it.

MEG
No wait! It's all --

She never gets to finish. The window explodes inward and a
pillar of slime leaps on the Panicking Man, engulfing him.

Meg runs up spraying CO2, but the extinguisher runs dry with a
LOUD RASPING SOUND. Moss rips a CO2 canister off the wall and

leaps in to help, forcing the creature back outside.

The Blob recoils, dragging its wildly kicking victim with it.

A WOMAN scrambles away as the Blob writhes up out of an air
vent. A MAN with an extinguisher hurries to her rescue,
blasting the slime back down the vent.

As he helps the woman to her feet, a huge coil of slime bursts
from the open fireplace behind him and jerks him away. He's
crushed to death as it drags him up the chimney.

his hair, now long and scraggly, is streaked with white...the
side of his face and neck are runneled furrows of healed scar
tissue from his burn.

Drenched in sweat, spittle flying, he screams and shouts his

An ancient black WOMAN silently enters behind him. Her
weathered face is a map of hard times, her eyes filled with
