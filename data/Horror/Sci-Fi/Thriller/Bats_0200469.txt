BLOODMOON
Fade In.

Opening credits: Background of the rising moon, and it is Blood
Red.

Over this background, the silhouettes of several fighters cross
back and forth, throwing beautiful techniques, hitting each
other.

Various other IMAGES, of victims, women, swords, weapons, also
appear and then disappear. Various Chinese characters, all
with a MOON motif, also appear.

At the end of the credit roll, one fighter, the Killer, stands
alone, still in silhouette, his arms raised to the sky.

Fresh blood streams down the moon, covering this image,
DISSOLVING into the exterior of an old style, traditional boxing

gym.
EXT. BOXING GYM -- NIGHT

A back to the basics kind of gym, full of old leather punching
bags, and even more leathery fighters. There are several cars
in the parking lot, and the lights are on.

INT. BOXING GYM -- CONTINUOUS

In the ring a very muscular FIGHTER is sparring rounds. He is
very good, scoring at will on his sparring PARTNER. The sense
of confidence the Fighter has can be FELT as he plays with his
Partner, flicking in and out, making contact but doing no real
damage.

He is not, however, trying to put his sparring Partner out.

There are people all around the ring, working on heavy bags,
speed bags, treadmills, exercise bikes, stairclimbers.

A banner above the ring reads "Home of the Light Heavyweight
Champion of the World."

The bell sounds, and the action breaks in the ring, both
fighters hitting their gloves together and going to their
corners.

CORNERMAN
Way to go, Champ. Closing time!

FIGHTER

I'm going to work the bag, Ernie.
Listen, you go on. I'll lock it up.

The cornerman agrees, and the fighters start migrating to the
doors.

INT. BOXING GYM -- LATER

The Fighter is hitting the heavy bag, while in the WINDOW above
him, the Blood Red Moon fills the glass.

As the Fighter hits the heavy bag, he hears something and
suspects that something is wrong. Coated in sweat, he goes
looking around the gym.

He looks in several shadowy places, only to find nothing.
Shaking his head, he starts back towards the heavy bag when he
hears...

KILLER (0.S.)
You fight well. <BEAT> Champ.

The KILLER, a tall, very muscular, very handsome man, appears
at the other end gym. He moves with an easy grace, and comes
closer to the Fighter. The Fighter sizes him up. An air about
the Killer tells the Fighter he knows what he's talking about.

FIGHTER
All dressed up and no place to go?

KILLER
You don't have the killer instinct.
<BEAT> I can show it to you.

FIGHTER
Is that a fact? Well, maybe some time
we could go a round or two.

KILLER
No time like the present. Or are
you...scared...?

The Fighter sizes the Killer up for a moment, then smiles a
small, confident smile.

FIGHTER
You got a death wish, buddy?

KILLER
Did you notice that there is blood on
the moon tonight?

The Fighter doesn't know what to make of this remark as they
head for the ring.

The Killer and the Fighter climb up into the ring and face
off.

(CONTINUED)
olden rev.

10/17/97)

A single overhead light SHINES down on them, throwing strange
SHADOWS on the ring and on the walls of the boxing gym.

The killer starts toward the Fighter, a small smile on his
lips.

KILLER (CONT'D)
The key to winning is to take advantage
of every weakness. Like how you never
really cover your side...

He swings quickly, three times, and BURIES three deadly hooks
in the man's kidneys. The Fighter bends over in pain, his
hands at his side.

KILLER (CONT'D)
Always attack is lesson two.

And the Killer does just that. He throws powerhouse punches,
and the Fighter's defense cannot withstand the barrage. He is
getting HIT.

HARD.

FIGHTER
Hey, man, that's enough...

The Fighter has his arms up, covering his face and head.
Surrendering.
KILLER
It's never enough. Lesson Three. A
true champion never goes easy, never
lets up.

He comes on, the blows cruel and calculated. The Fighter
doesn't stand a chance.

The Killer keeps punching, his gloves glistening with the
Fighter's blood.

KILLER (CONT'D)
Fight! Goddamn it! FIGHT!

But, in the face of the Killer's onslaught, there is no fight,
only slaughter. The Fighter falls to the canvas, but the Killer
continues to drive his fists into the fallen man until there

is no more movement.

The Killer stands over the fallen fighter.

KILLER (CONT'D)
School's Out, Champ.

He turns to the window of the gym, and raises his arms to the
moon.

4 EXT. STREETS -- MORNING

Establishing shot, New York streets. A man is riding a
motorcycle on the streets.

5 EXT. BOXING GYM CRIME SCENE -- MORNING

The boxing gym has been turned into a Crime Scene, with police
cars in front of the gym. Their lights flash against the dawn's
light.

CHUCK BURKE, a black detective about 35 years old, rides up on
his Black TRIUMPH motorcycle. He gets off and walks into the
busy crime scene. In front of the entrance to the gym is a
pile of stuff, and Chuck, instead of climbing over it,
gracefully jumps from place to place in a very acrobatic way.

The cops around the scene see him, but they are used to his
eccentric ways. They ignore it.

6 INT. BOXING GYM -- CONTINUOUS

Burke strides confidently into the boxing gym, taking in
everything as he walks to the two UNIFORMS near the body.

CHUCK
What do we have here, ladies? Somebody
talk to me.

Chuck absently runs a scarf through his fist, and it comes out
alternately blue and red, red and blue.

CRIME SCENE COP
(Looking at his notes)
Well, Detective, we have one dead boxer,
Eddie Cunningham, 33 years old, Light
Heavy Champion of the World. Found in
the ring, this morning. <BEAT> Somebody
beat him to death.

CHUCK
Guess we got a new champ. Is this the
latest from our boy? Do we make it
three?

CRIME SCENE COP

No witnesses, no finger prints, plenty
of blood and guts...

olden rev. 10/17/97)

CHUCK
Any chance he left a suicide note?
<after a BEAT> Boys and girls, sounds
like we have ourselves a homicide.

They share a grim smile, and Chuck kneels down to look more
closely at the body. Chuck shakes his head at the grisly sight.

CHUCK (CONT'D)
What the hell is going on?

He runs the scarf through once more, and it comes out completely

white.
He respectfully lays it carefully over the face of the dead
Fighter.

7 EXT. POLICE STATION -- MORNING

Chuck arrives at the station, and sees a phalanx of reporters,
surrounding CHIEF HUTCHINS. He looks frustrated, and a little
angry. Chuck quickly about faces and heads for a side door.
As he goes, we SEE Hutchins talking to the media.

REPORTERS
(Stepping on each other)
Is this the work of the same man?

Do you have any suspects?
What are you doing to catch him?
Any communication with the killer?

HUTCHINS
We are following up every lead. We are
very close to cracking this case. We
just need patience and cooperation from
you people in the media...

Chuck pushes his way through the crowd, to the side entrance
of the building.

8 INT. POLICE STATION -- LATER

Chuck comes in and sits down wearily at his desk. It is covered
with papers, maps, notes, books, etc. There are martial arts
magazines scattered all over his desk.

CHUCK
Tell the M.E. I want her report on my
desk as soon as she has it. I waited
15 damn minutes for her banker's hours

SECRETARY
Chuck, Chief on line 2.

Chuck hits the phone off its cradle, catching it while it is
still up in the air. With his other hand, he is juggling two
balls in the air.

CHUCK
Hey, hey, hey. This is Burke. I'm
working it, Chief.

HUTCHINS (0.S.)
Goddamn it! We need some answers! Son
of a bitch!

CHUCK
Chief, chief, what's with that language!
Yes, Sir. Yes, Sir.

Chuck moans and takes the phone away from his ear, not listening
any more. The Chief's voice, tinny and thin, is heard through
the earpiece. He puts the phone down on his desk, and stands

up to meet one of the other OFFICERS in the squad, who walks

in to bring him a computer print out, a new challenge from the
Killer.

Chuck holds it up, looking at it closely.

OFFICER
Came in last night. Before the boxer.

Chuck nods his head and shrugs.

It is a computer print out of a graphic, a moon with blood on
it, and the words: "Blood on the Moon."

Chuck turns to his bulletin board, and pins it up along with
the other messages--challenging, taunting, deriding. He
continues juggling with one hand.

CHUCK
Variations on a theme. Why didn't I
get this last night?

OFFICER
It was attached to e-mail addressed to
the Chief.
CHUCK

Did you see him? Did he have the face

Who is reacting to the Chief standing behind Chuck.

CHUCK (CONT'D)
He's standing right behind me, isn't
he? I TOLD you not to bring these balls
in here!

The Officer walks away, quickly, anticipating the fireworks.

He turns around to face the enraged Chief, still juggling.
The Chief takes the balls from him, one by one.

HUTCHINS
We're up to our eyeballs in murder
victims, and you're screwing me around?
Any idea the pressure on me? I was
crucified this morning by the press!

Chuck tries to charm the Chief.

CHUCK
That's because you, Chief, are the man!
Hey, great to see you. You should slum
down here more often...

Chuck reaches out to smooth down his lapels, and pulls a silver
dollar out of his jacket, showing it to Hutchins with a
flourish.

HUTCHINS

Get some results, Chuck! You ever do
that again...

(pointing at the phone

on Chuck's desk)
The Great Chucker can book himself magic
shows in Atlantic City, 'cause he won't
be working here! <BEAT> Juggle these
balls!

The Chief stalks out of the doorway, tossing the juggling balls
back to him. When he is gone, Chuck smiles.

Chuck turns back to his wall, scanning all the collected
information. He starts juggling as he looks through it all.

Empty shot of Blood Red moon in the reflection of a puddle of
water. A car SLICES through the water, and the CAMERA TILTS
UP to reveal an establishing shot of a Sleazoid Bar.

OMITTED 10
INT. SLEAZOID BAR -- CONTINUOUS 11

The bar is smoky, and nearly empty. DUTCH, the owner of the
bar, is a big, muscular man who looks like he doesn't take
shit from anyone. His trophies and photos from his fighting
career rare all over the bar.

Dutch and his lady, ROXY, very sexy, though a little slutty,
are alone in the bar. Roxy is sitting at the bar, and she
wants to dance, and Dutch complies. They start to sway to the
slow music, and Dutch kisses Roxy. She responds, and soon
they are on one of the pinball machines. Dutch is undressing
Roxy, when she thinks she heard something.

ROXY
What was that?

DUTCH
Nothing! Don't break the mood!

Dutch gets Roxy's shirt off, and starts on her bra, but she is
sure she heard something. She tries to push Dutch off, but he
is in heat and won't take no for an answer. He goes for her
shorts, and has them unzipped before she can push him away.

ROXY
I heard something, goddamn it!

as she goes.

DUTCH
Come back here, you bitch.

ROXY

My luck with men is for shit...

KILLER (0.S.)
Roxy, your luck is about to change...

She turns with a wary look on her face, and the Killer gently
CHOKES her out. He catches her before she hits the ground,
and lays her down carefully on the floor. He then advances on
Dutch, who has his back to the bar.

DUTCH
You find anything?

KILLER
She found me, Crutch.

DUTCH
The name's 'Dutch'.

KILLER
It won't be, after tonight.
(he sizes up Dutch)
Marvelous night for a moondance.

Dutch is ready for the Killer, itching to fight. The Killer
moves out to face Dutch. He puts a scared face on.

Dutch attacks, and hits the Killer several times. The Killer
is not fighting back--he takes a couple of awkward swings, but
misses by a mile.

Dutch thinks he's in full control.
The Killer backs up and holds his hand up.

Dutch laughs and closes on The Killer.

DUTCH
No way! You're mine!

The Killer's scared demeanor changes completely, and he stands
up to his full height.

KILLER
(smiling)
OK.

He attacks Dutch first, tearing him apart. The Killer really
takes it to Dutch, never letting up. He hits him up one side
and down the other.

Dutch is helpless.

The Killer is enraged.

He was looking for a good fight, but he's not getting it.
It's the pugilistic equivalent of a barrel shoot.

KILLER (CONT'D)
Why aren't you better?

He hits Dutch at will.

KILLER (CONT'D)
Tough man? You're not tough!

The Killer grabs him by the head from behind and smiles. He
is going to kill him.

The Killer stops smiling, and looks almost like he is going to
let Dutch go. But then, he wrenches Dutch's head, breaking
his neck and killing him. He lets Dutch slide to the ground.

The Killer walks away from the death.
INT. MORGUE -- MORNING 12

The shattered body of Dutch is on the examining table, the
MEDICAL EXAMINER having just finished the autopsy.

Standing with him are Chuck, Chief Hutchins, and one other

MEDICAL EXAMINER (CONT'D)
The killer has a knowledge of anatomy,
the destruction is systematic, precise--
every strike is a vital area, a nerve
center or a meridian. He definitely
has a signature, I recognize it.

CHUCK
Any evidence of a weapon? Or post mortem
mutilation?

MEDICAL EXAMINER
It doesn't look like he used a weapon,
but I've never seen wounds like these.
As for mutilation, it's the fight he's
interested in. Once they're dead, he's
done.

HUTCHINS
What about the witness?

CHUCK
The Killer choked her out, didn't hurt
her, before she could see him clearly.
I have her looking at mug shots anyway.

HUTCHINS
This one makes four, right?

Chuck just nods.

HUTCHINS (CONT'D)
I'm assigning you some help in this,

CHUCK

The Chief leaves them standing there, around Dutch's dead body.
EXT. SEASHORE -- DAY 13

We open on a little girl, LAUREN, seven years old, working on

a sand sculpture on the beach. There is a straw sticking out

of the front of the sculpture. Lauren is very concentrated on
making the sand as smooth and as nice as possible. Suddenly,

the sand sculpture SHIFTS a little.

LAUREN
Don't move, Dad!

Just then, the sculpture SNEEZES and ex-cop, now retired, KEN
O'HARA, comes out of the sculpture, shaking the sand off of
him. He ROARS like a monster, and CHASES Lauren, and they go
running into the water.

Terry advances on Ken, and there is now a crowd of people

him. Terry keeps coming, swinging wildly.

Terry goes to punch Ken again, and Ken blocks it this time and
takes the man down, subduing him. As soon as he does this,

Chuck reaches out for her hand, and immediately a bouquet of

is startled, and she stumbles into Chuck. He catches her and
they share a laugh.

Ken is sitting in an easy chair, reading a novel. He can't

INT. MASTER DOJO -- CONTINUOUS 24

We PULL OUT from MASTER TOKAIDO, who is meditating in his dojo.
It is a very traditional martial arts dojo, hard wood floor.
There are trophies everywhere, and a bookshelf full of research
tomes. Training equipment, calligraphy and martial arts weapons
serve as the decorations on every wall in sight.

The dojo is empty save for Master Tokaido. He is in
traditional dress (black kimono, white gi top, helmets), and a
sword lies on the floor next to him.

As he meditates a "student" (the Killer) walks in, in full
kendo garb, complete with helmet. The Killer walks up to where
the Master is meditating.

The MASTER senses him and what he is there to do. Without
opening his eyes, he says...

MASTER
Your spirit is unclean.

The Killer says nothing, standing waiting.

The Killer is carrying a high tech, compact video camera and a
cellular phone, and he places the camera in position. He then
turns to the Master, raising his sword.

KILLER

Hajime!
He barks the command to begin to spar, and the Master opens
his eyes and looks at him strangely. He gets up and dons his
helmet, bringing his sword into position.
The Killer attacks with his sword, and the fight has begun.
The Master is confident that he will be able to beat this
interloper.

The two circle each other, exchanging swordplay. The Master
is good, but the Killer is better.

Faster. Stronger.

Chuck walks up to the officer who called him, DONNA, who is
sitting in a wheelchair, and pulls a seat up to her computer
monitors--there are two of them, one fixed on the "Bloodmoon"
graphic. As he sits down, he pulls a piece of candy out of
her ear, and hands it to her.

CHUCK

DONNA
This just started coming in. It looks

The Master is getting HIT OFTEN and HIT HARD.

The Killer whirls and strikes the Master across the helmet,

He strikes again, and this time the Master's breastplate is

A little blood flows from the almost surgical slice.

The Killer CUTS the Master's bamboo shiniai into several pieces.
He then lifts off his own helmet, smiling broadly.

MASTER
Who are you?

KILLER
You don't remember me? Pity.

The Killer discards his razor sharp blade and lowers himself
into a fighting position. The Master also prepares to fight,
thinking he has a better chance to stay alive without the blade.

He is wrong.

They fight, and the Killer uses the most brutal techniques in
his arsenal, and the Master doesn't stand a chance. The Killer
is about to finish him off, and stands over the Master's body.

As he approaches the front door, the front of the building

The windows and the door BLOW OUT!

Chuck is BLOWN BACK as the flames reach the sky, licking up at

Chuck lands on a patrol car that pulls up to the front of the

CHUCK
You read the file?

KEN
Carefully.

CHUCK
And...?

KEN

You're not getting anywhere, are you?
Chuck swallows a smart ass reply, and glances at the Chief.

CHUCK
That's why you're here. To save our
poor souls. You got any ideas?

KEN
A few. <BEAT> We're dealing with a
very organized killer, someone who plans.
These killings aren't random, spur of
the moment things. He only kills who
he wants to kill. Low risk victims in
low risk areas, no witnesses--everything
planned out very well.

Out of the corner of his eye, Chuck sees the Chief leave. He
turns his attention back to Ken.

KEN (CONT'D)

His behavior reflects his personality,
and his behavior is very controlled,
well orchestrated. His M.O. exists
nowhere else. Now, I thought...

Chuck holds up his hand for Ken to stop talking.

CHUCK

Ken nods his head and walks out of Chuck's office. Chuck
watches him go, then takes a piece of paper, balls it up and
shoots it at the wastebasket. It swishes through.

CHUCK (CONT'D)
He shoots, he scores!

INT. POLICE STATION -- NIGHT 43

Chuck is working alone, going through the piles of files and

He is looking for something, and he picks up a picture of the
Master's dojo, post explosion. He looks closely at the picture,
but isn't satisfied.

He decides he has to go back to the Master's dojo. Picking up
his jacket as he walks out, Chuck leaves.

Chuck comes inside and begins to look around for what he needs.
As he moves through the downstairs, he senses that something
is off, wrong.

He looks around, staying still.
He's not alone. There is someone already inside the dojo!

A figure is there, walking through the crime scene, moving
through the scene, back and forth.

Chuck watches for a moment, trying to figure out what he is
doing. Finally, Chuck comes forward, to put a stop to this.
As soon as he dislodges from the shadows, the figure attacks!

A fight ensues, and both men are very skilled fighters. As
they fight, Chuck pulls out a small flashlight, and tries to
light it to illuminate the other. The other man pulls out his
own flashlight.

Finally, the flashlights come on together, and the fighters
see each other--it's Ken!

CHUCK
You! What are you doing here?

Chuck flicks on a small wall light, giving some light. The
windows and door are blown out, but the place is not completely
destroyed.

KEN
My job. Remember?

CHUCK
Man, you're lucky I didn't kill you!

KEN
Yeah, I'm positively blessed.

Ken and Chuck stop fighting and face the door, and there stands
KELLY, the Master's beautiful daughter.

KELLY

Chuck looks at Kelly. He pulls out his badge and flashes it

Chuck, the third wheel in this situation, is uncomfortable.
He clears his throat, and Kelly and Ken break off their embrace.

KEN
There was no sign of forced entry, and
the explosion was pretty primitive--
gasoline and a stick of dynamite. I
didn't see a timer, so he had to be
waiting for Detective Burke...

CHUCK
How do you know that?

KEN
I found it, skulking. He was waiting
for Burke here to come running, maybe
he's tied into our GPS system so he can
track our vehicles, and blew the place
up just before he went inside.

HUTCHINS
To cover his tracks?

KEN
To send a message--the killings are
getting closer together, and he's getting
better. It's almost as if he's learning.
And, he's getting more confident, so
now he's sending us the computer notes,
taunting us...This guy is so out there
with technology, and I'm lost. I know
a computer hacker from a case a couple
of years ago. I want to go see him,
get some advice on the computer end of

The place is a pit, filled with dirty clothes, trash, books,

Star Trek, Deep Space Nine, Alien stuff adorns the walls, floor
and furniture.

At one of the black, oversize monitors sits JUSTICE, an
overweight man with thick glasses. He is holding a bottle in

prominent picture is missing, and there is blood on the wall
where it was.

KELLY
What do you make of this? There's blood
on the wall.

Now he's interested.

CHUCK
The mystery picture. Who do you think
is in it?

KEN

Get a shot of the wall, and as soon as
the scene is processed, get these
pictures over to the office too, OK?
You did good, Kelly.

INT. POLICE STATION -- DAY 84

Ken, Chuck and Kelly are together in a large meeting staring
at the pictures of the crime scene.

One of the pictures, blown up very big, is the letters written
in the blood. It's obvious that the letters are C-H-A. Ona
bulletin board next to the pictures they are writing out all
the possible "Cha" words.

CHUCK
I tell you, he's trying to write the
Killer's name.

One list is possible last names (like Champlaign, etc.). They
have a phone book out opened to the CHA pages.

Kelly reads the list of "ch" names:

KELLY
Chamberlain. Chambers. Chambless.
Chameleon...
KEN
It doesn't ring right.
CHUCK
He's not writing Champagne, that's for

sure.

Kelly pulls out a dog-eared dictionary, and leafs through the
pages.

KELLY
Maybe he's spelling something else.
Chamber, chamberlain, chambermaid...

KEN
The chambermaid did it...

KELLY
Chamber music, chambray,
chameleon...chamfer, chaoisa, chamomile,
champ, champagne, champion...

KEN
Wait a minute!
CHUCK
Champion! Son of a bitch!
KEN
It was right here the whole time.
KELLY
What?
CHUCK

All the victims were or are champions.
He's killing them all.

He goes to the victims' photographs on the wall.

CHUCK (CONT'D)
Boxing. Wrestling. Tough Man. Karate.
Kendo. Kickboxing. Shit! These are
all champions--but they wouldn't have
fought each other. They have their own
competitions.

Ken is silent for a moment, then raises his head to look
directly at Chuck.

KEN
They fought together once.
CHUCK
Huh?
KEN
Yeah, and the link is her father, my
instructor.
CHUCK
What are you talking about?
KEN
You hear of the Master's Challenge?
CHUCK
Damn it!
KEN

Remember the tag line?

KELLY
"The Tournament of Champions"

They look at each other. They've made the connection, now
they have to find the killer.

CHUCK
I've got some magazines with those
pictures in it.

He pulls a magazine out of his drawer, and leafs through it.
He finds the picture he was looking for.

INT. POLICE STATION -- LATER 85

The picture from the Master's Challenge is blown up very big
and tacked up on the wall. Six of the Champions are already
dead, and there are two left.

Ken goes up to the blown up picture, with a red pen in his
hands. As he says the name of each victim, he puts a red CROSS
across their faces.

KEN
Eddie Cunningham, boxer. Victim. Dutch
Schultz, tough man. Victim. Kurt
McKinney, point Karate. Mark Cramer,
Kickboxing, victim. Master Tokaido,
victim. Kevin Haley, Judo, victim.

Ken circles two of the heads, men not accounted for.

KEN (CONT'D)
Who are these guys?

Chuck comes into the room, a file in his hands.

CHUCK
The first guy is Chad Atkins, kung fu
stylist, disqualified during the
Tournament of Champions for excessive
contact. Broke some poor guy's ribs.

KEN
I like him so far.

CHUCK
Don't fall in love, it'd be a tough
arrest. Computer says he died in a car
accident three years ago.

KEN
Shit.

Just then, Chief Hutchins comes into the room for an update.

KELLY
No. It happened too fast, and...I don't

CHUCK

This Namath guy has a sheet you wouldn't

for assault with intent to kill.

KEN
No model citizen.

INT. DANCE CLUB -- DAY 92

Kelly is sitting in the dance bar, alone.

She is drinking, still depressed and frustrated by not being
involved.

There are lots of people around her, dancing and partying.
Her mood is in stark contrast to the party going on around
her.

A distinctive BEEP sounds, 0.S., and Kelly looks up to see
what it is.

Off in one portion of the bar is a metal detector, and SOMEONE
has gone through the bar's metal detector, and set it off.

It's a metal joint, in my hand...

Kelly watches the person, and when he turns around Kelly sees

The music abruptly stops, and the dance floor clears of dancers.

The Killer spots Kelly and moves towards her, grabbing her by
the shirt, lifting her up off the chair!

It's not Kelly!

He scans the crowd for Kelly, she's nowhere to be seen. He
too exits the building.

The Killer looks around the parking lot. No one is there.
There are a couple of PARTY GOERS, laughing and happy.

Kelly is not there.

The Killer, knowing that he has to leave, goes to his car in

then runs to get into the garage right before the garage door

goes down.

Kelly is making her way through the house, looking in various
rooms. It is all very spooky, very frightening. The house is

well kept inside, but very old.

She is exploring, looking for clues, evidence, anything.

Kelly comes across a phenomenal computer set up, acupuncture

dummy, and a bulletin board filled with pictures of the

killings, news clippings, lists upon lists of victims, and so

She screams, only to see that the "figure" is a coat on a hangar
that fell from the closet.

She breathes a sigh of relief and closes the closet.
To come FACE TO FACE WITH THE KILLER!

KILLER
Well, Kelly. How nice to see you again.

KELLY

Ken WHIPS his head around to look at the computer.

A new picture comes up, and it is of Ken, his wife and daughter--
obviously taken during their afternoon out. Then, the picture

of Ken turns into the picture of the Killer, and he pulls out

a knife to kill the wife and daughter.
