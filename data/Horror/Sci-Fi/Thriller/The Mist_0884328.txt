FADE IN:

BLACKNESS. And silence. A title card comes up:
THE STORM

A CRASH OF LIGHTNING rips from the sky, revealing:

EXT. MILITARY BASE - NIGHT

A METAL SIGN on a chainlink fence being whipped by a nasty
storm: "ARROWHEAD PROJECT -- MILITARY PERSONNEL ONLY." WE
CLOSE IN as LIGHTNING BOOMS AND CRASHES, moving past the sign
to reveal a low, nondescript building...

INT. ARROWHEAD PROJECT LAB -' NIGHT

.--in which high-tech EQUIPMENT encircles a huge, pressurized
CHAMBER. The chamber is low-tech -- massively thick glass
windows, ribbed-and-riveted steel, like an old-fashioned diving
helmet reinterpreted as a large room. It's dark inside,
fathomless. Lab-coated PERSONNEL are everywhere, seated at
work stations, computer screens streaming data.

A pair of tense scientists, MACHEN and NAYLOR, hover at the
shoulder of a seated tech named PHILLIPS.

NAYLOR
We should pull the plug for tonight.
The storm...

MACHEN

++-S'got nothing to do with it. our

Power sources are shielded. Stable.
(off Naylor's look)

Relax.

Activity mounts. We hear a rising TURBINE WHINE. Banks of
VIDEO AND WAVE-SPECTRUM CAMERAS are trained at the darkness
within the chamber. Everybody's intensely focused, eyeing
their data streams, murmuring to one another, the whole vibe
very "Mission Control." Phillips glances up:

PHILLIPS
Sir? Alignments are set.

MACHEN
Engage.

Switches are thrown, commands keyed in. Scient
peer into the chamber, eyes straining into the

ists and soldiers
darkness, and:

A_FAINT PINPOINT OF LIGHT appears inside the chamber, blooming
nto existence from nothing, growing ever brighter like a
spotlight being shined through a keyhole...
THE ROOM

A hush falls. Faces are slack, stunned. A UNIFORMED COLONEL
moves to Machen's side, gazing in wonder as:

Inside the chamber, the "keyhole" widens, irising open to
become a portal of dancing, swirling light. It shimmers,
growing larger and brighter, halating the glass...

People are struck with wonder, light rippling their faces,
reluctantly tearing their eyes away to check their boards as:

MACHEN
Check your data streams. Give me
constant updates, flag any
anomalies...

Suddenly:
EXT. MILITARY BASE/LAB - NIGHT

LIGHTNING slams from the sky, blasting along the fence, the
power lines, anything metal or electrical. A SOLDIER is blown
out of the guard booth as the surge EXPLODES every circuit
and panel, sending up showers of sparks as it courses along...

---and WE PAN the surge as it goes blazing into the TURBINES
powering the lab, sending them into smoking overdrive...

INT. ARROWHEAD LAB - NIGHT
+--and creating instant panic as:

PHILLIPS
We got a hell of a surge! Needles
are way in the red!

MACHEN
Disengage! Shut it down!

A mad flurry as they try to shut the system down -- but the
WHINE CONTINUES TO BUILD, the "portal of light" within the
chamber growing larger and brighter still...

COLONEL

C'mon, kill the goddamn power!
PHILLIPS

I can't!
MACHEN

What do you mean, you can't? Trip
the breakers!

Machen darts over, frantically punching buttons. Phillips’
screen is flashing data almost too fast to make sense of,
while the light inside the chamber swirls ever faster...
NAYLOR
The system's overloading!

PHILLIPS
Where's the power coming from?

MACHEN
{gazes up, realizing)
The lightning. We're pulling it
right out of the sky. .

EXT. MILITARY BASE/LAB - NIGHT

He's right -- overlapping BOLTS OF LIGHTNING are blazing down,
coursing through the array of power turbines...

INT. ARROWHEAD LAB - NIGHT

.-While the light within the chamber builds into a whirlwind
of unearthly power. People shield their eyes from the glare,
helpless to do anything but watch. A few techs break and run...

MACHEN

Remain at your stations!
COLONEL

How thick is that goddamn glass?
MACHEN

Thick enough. Pressurized to forty

atmospheres.

But even Machen sounds uncertain. The Colonel moves closer,
peering deeper into the light. It's blinding us, but:

COLONEL
(hushed)

Am I...seeing something in there?

ANGLE SHIFTS TO VIDEO TECH #1, scared shitless, trying to
darken and adjust the image enough to see.

VIDEO TECH #1
There's something...

MACHEN
What?

VIDEO TECH #1
+--Something. ..moving.

We see it. Something in the light. Something...slithery. And
that's when the first CRACK appears in the glass. The SOUND
OF THE SNAP makes everybody freeze, staring in horror,

desperately hoping it holds, but:
4.

CRACK, SNAP! Another crack. The glass begins to spiderweb.
People turn and run, but it's too late, because:

MACHEN
(softly)
Jesus.

WHAM -- the first window EXPLODES out, lacerating a tech with
flying glass, blowing him back in his seat as a HUGE ERUPTION
OF OTHERWORLDLY MIST blows through and engulfs him...

---and the windows EXPLODE in sequence as the mist freight -
trains into the room, blowing techs back in their chairs,
engulfing people on the run, muffling their screams, wiping
everything completely and utterly into:

BLACKNESS. Silence.

FADE TO:

FLASHES OF SLO-MO LIGHTNING play ghostlike and surreal, rimming
the faces of a family breathlessly watching the storm approach.
DAVID DRAYTON, his wife STEFF, their 5 year-old son BILLY.

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

They're silhouetted at a big picture window, storm roiling in
SLO-MO outside, clouds rippling, LIGHTNING arcing across the
sky. There's a huge old TREE out there, whipping in-the wind.

David turns, murmurs something to Steff -- we can’t hear the
words, just the HOWLING OF THE WIND.

A MATCH

flares in the dark, touches a candle wick. The flame rises,
bringing light...

BASEMENT STAIRS

;-and they come down the steps, each carrying a candle, Billy
leading the way. The boy is especially careful carrying his
candle, back straight, being brave.

The candlelight weaves and dances, making the shadows move in

sinister ways. The family passes by us, gliding down the steps
and disappearing from view, the meager glow of their candles
diminishing to blackness again...

LIVING ROOM - ANGLE ON A PAINTING

+++as we SLOWLY PUSH IN on a finished PAINTING on an easel,
storm thundering outside the picture window b.g. The painting
is art for a movie poster, and exquisitely done.

WHAM! The painting gets smashed as a BLAST OF LIGHTNING AND
THUNDER sends that huge old tree CRASHING straight at us
>.

through the picture window where the family stood only moments
ago, freight-training into the room in a rain-driven explosion
of glass and smoking tree trunk, as we

FADE TO BLACK
EXT. HOUSE - WIDE ESTABLISHING - MORNING

It's gorgeous -- blue skies, high clouds, birds twittering.
The house is at the edge of a wide lake, mountains b.g. Billy
runs out of the house in his pajamas, pauses at the oak that
was split in half by lightning.

BILLY
Wow!

He goes charging off. David exits the house with the damaged
painting in his hands, checking it in daylight. Debris is
everywhere -- branches, lawn furniture, other trees downed.

DAVID,

stops before the charred tree trunk, scowling at the part
that went through the house. Steff exits onto the porch.

STEFF
Power's still out. Food's gonna go
bad.

DAVID

Do a list. I'll head into town before
the store gets bought out.

STEFF
{re: the painting)
Can you save it?

DAVID
This? No way. I'll have to do it
again from scratch. I'll have to
call the studio, see if they'll
extend my deadline.

STEFF
What choice do they have?

DAVID
You kidding? They can whip up some
bad Photoshop poster in an afternoon.
Two big heads. They do it all the-
time.

(gazes at the painting)

I should'a brought it downstairs
last night. Stupid.
STEFF
You couldn't know a tree was going
to come through the window.

DAVID
(looks to the window)
I'll hit the hardware store too.
Get some plastic sheeting, duct
tape. I'll seal that up before dark,
order some new glass in.

STEFF
(beat, realizing)
That was your grandfather's tree.
The one he planted...

DAVID
Yeah. I used to play in it.

She comes down the steps, takes him in her arms.

DAVID
Just stuff, hon. We're all right,
that's what counts. We were standing
at that window. If we hadn't gone
downstairs when we did...

The rest is left unsaid. She shudders. Suddenly, Billy comes
skidding around the corner of the house, amped up:

BILLY
Mom! Dad! Ya gotta come see!

STEFF
Billy, take it easy! Don't go
charging around!

BILLY
But ya gotta come lookit! The
boathouse is all bashed! There's a
dock on the rocks--and, and--there's
trees in the cove! Holy crap!

STEFF
Billy!

BILLY
Sorry, Ma--but you gotta--wow!

He's gone again, charging from view.

DAVID
Having spoken, the doomsayer departs.

Steff can't help laughing in spite of everything.
STEFF
How come you two always manage to
make me laugh?

DAVID
You have low standards?
(smiles, takes her hand)
Let's go see the damage.

STEFF
I can do that in my living room.”
They proceed around the corner of the house ---and pause.
NEW ANGLE

reveals their boathouse smashed flat by a huge pine from the

neighbor's property -- the wind snapped it off near the base
and over it went, bam. Steff looks pissed:

STEFF
That's Norton's tree.

DAVID
Yeah. The dead one I've been asking
him to take down for three years
before it blew over. That tree.

They come down toward the water, where Billy's peering with
bright-eyed excitement at the boathouse:

_ BILLY
Wow, it really got smooshed!

DAVID
(mutters to Steff)

Nobody appreciates good destruction
like a five year-old.

Billy glances up, seeing something across the lake.

BILLY
Wooaaah...

David and Steff look up, and now they see it too:

The far end of the lake is gone. In its place is a wall of
mist, unnaturally straight and creeping this way. It has a
deeply strange quality to it -- instead of refracting sunlight
as normal mist would, this glows dead-white.

BILLY
What is it, Daddy?

DAVID
Fog bank.
STEFP
On the lake?

DAVID
We've had fog on the lake before.

STEFF
Not like that.

DAVID
Probably a leftover from the storm.
Two fronts meeting, something like
that.

STEFF
Are you sure?

DAVID
Honey, I'm not the weatherman.

STEFF
C'mon, Billy, inside. Daddy's heading
into town, if you wanna go.
(to David)
You coming?

DAVID
I'm gonna go have a chat with our
neighbor about his tree.
(off her look)
Don't worry, I'm not gonna punch
bim in the nose or anything.

STEFF
David, what's the point? You know
what he's gonna say, don't you?
"Sue me." Maybe we should.

DAVID
Honey, one property dispute with
this guy was enough to last me a
lifetime. I'm just gonna ask for
-his insurance info, that's all.

She heads for the house, taking Billy. CAMERA FOLLOWS David
as he makes his way to the edge of the yard, steps over a low
fence, and proceeds onto his neighbor's property.

He starts hearing a low sound ahead as he walks -- whut-whut-
whut! Somebody trying to start a chainsaw.

NORTON (0.S.)
Shit.

David keeps moving toward the sound -- whut-whut-whut!
NORTON (0.S.)
Motherfuck.

He proceeds up the slope of the yard -- whut-whut-whut!

NORTON (0.S.)
Cocksucker.

And then we see him: BRENT NORTON, the neighbor, an overweight
New York City lawyer in his 50's. He's bent over a chainsaw,
face pinched with sheer frustration as he yanks the cord again

and again to no avail -- whut-whut-whut! Whut-whut-whut!
Norton suddenly realizes he's not alone -- he turns, seeing
David. A beat, both of them embarrassed, then:
DAVID
Won't start?
NORTON

Goddamn thing cost two hundred
dollars, why should it start?

DAVID
I guess you've seen the boathouse.

NORTON
(bristling)
Yeah? So?

DAVID
Nothing. I just think we should
swap insurance info. That's all.

NORTON
(bitter laugh)
Oh, my agent's gonna love me...

David follows Norton's glance, sees it: a car can be glimpsed
under the branches of a tree that came down and crushed it.

DAVID
(slowly realizing)
Oh. Oh shit. That's not the Benz,
is it? The 1960?

NORTON
I drove it up this trip. I was gonna
bring the station wagon, but...the
weather was so nice when I left New
York...you know, top down...

DAVID
Oh, man, Brent, I'm sorry. Sincerely.

NORTON
That's nice of you to say.
10.

DAVID
No, I mean it. That car was cherry.
I hate seeing it like that.

Norton absorbs this, nods.

NORTON
I'll find my insurance guy's number,
bring it by later. That okay?

DAVID
No problem.

David walks away. Norton's watching him go. Norton hesitates,
hating to ask, but:

NORTON
David?

(David turns back)
You're not heading into town today
by any chance, are you?

INT. DRAYTON KITCHEN - DAY

Steff£'s at the sink with the water running, separating broken
and unbroken dishes. She glances out the window, surprised to
see Norton trailing David into the yard.

EXT. HOUSE - DAY
Steff exits onto the porch.

STEFF
Brent.

NORTON
Hi, Steff.
(awkward beat)
Some morning, huh?

STEFF
You could say that.

DAVID
Brent needs a new chainsaw. He's
gonna ride into town with us.

STEFF
Something wrong with your car?

NORTON
A tree came down on it.

STEFF
(beat)
I was sorry to hear about Carla,
Brent. We all were.
dle

NORTON
Thank you. It was...sudden. Two
months from when she was diagnosed.

STEFF
I'm sure that wasn't easy.

NORTON
No. It wasn't.

Billy comes charging out of the house in fresh jeans and
sneakers, past Steff, down the stairs:

BILLY
Ready, Daddy!

DAVID ;
Great, champ! Mr. Norton's coming
too.

BILLY

(suddenly shy)
Hi, Mr. Norton.

NORTON
Biya, Billy.

STEFF
(coming down the steps)
Here's the grocery list...pick up
some ice, too, if they've got it,
so we can keep the milk cold...

NORTON (0.S.)
That is the weirdest thing.

They turn. Norton's shading his eyes, gazing across the lake.
The mist has swallowed half of it, still coming this way.

NORTON
That mist. I saw it coming down the
mountain this morning, now it's
halfway across the lake. Some kind
of inversion layer, I guess.

David stares at it, getting a bad feeling. Something about
that mist spooks him, but he has no idea why.

DAVID
Hon? Why don’t you come with us?

STEFF
i'm up to my ears in glass and mud,
that's why. It'll take me all day.
You guys go, I'll be fine.
12.
She kisses him, heads back inside...

EXT, HOUSE - WIDE - DAY

David's 4WD Scout comes rumbling up to the top of the driveway,
the house b.g. David pauses, looks back. The mist is now
nearing this side of the lake.

Steff emerges from the house wearing a big floppy sun hat and
dragging a trash bag. She sees them, waves. David waves back,
puts his misgivings aside, drives out onto the rural road...

INT/EXT. SCOUT/RURAL ROAD - MOVING SHOT - DAY

..-where a PAIR OF ORANGE CMP (municipal power) TRUCKS come
lumbering by us, going the other way. ANGLE TO David at the
wheel of the Scout, Norton in the passenger seat, Billy in
back. David glances in the rearview at the trucks.

: DAVID
Well, CMP's out in force. Maybe
we'll get our power back.

NORTON
We can hope.

A stretch of awkward silence, both men feeling uncomfortable
riding together. Norton reaches for the radio.

NORTON
You mind?
David shrugs -- go ahead. Norton starts scanning for a station.
NORTON

That was some storm, huh?

DAVID
One for the books. For a moment
there last night, I thought we were
gonna take off and head for 02.

BILLY
Like Dorothy!
DAVID
(smiles)

Yeah, champ, like Dorothy.

NORTON
WOXO's off the air. Just static.
(keeps scanning)
Portland's still broadcasting. That
easy listening station...
13s.

BILLY
Daddy, look! Army men!

David glances up as MILITARY TRUCKS AND VEHICLES race by in
the opposite direction, just like the CMP trucks did.

NORTON
It's those guys from the Arrowhead
Project.
(looks to David)
You're a local. Any idea what they
do up there?

DAVID
I'm sure you've heard all the crazy
stories.

NORTON

The gal at the dry cleaners swears
they've got a crashed flying saucer
up there. Frozen alien bodies.

DAVID _
Edna, right. Miss Tabloid. "I Had
Bigfoot's Baby." "Satan's Face
Appears in Oilwell Fire.* All that
good hard news.

(beat)
You know Mrs. Carmody? Owns that
weird antique shop in town? .

NORTON
The creepy place with all the dead
stuffed animals in the window?

DAVID
That's the one. Bumped into her at
the gas station one day and she
starts in on Arrowhead. She informs
us they're fooling around with
"atomic things." That's what she
said: "Those Army boys are shooting
atoms into the air, make no mistake."

NORTON
What'd you say?

DAVID
Not me, my son. My five year-old.
(in rearview mirror)
What'd you say, Billy?

BILLY
I told her the air's full of atoms.
That's what our teacher says.
Everything's full of atoms.
14.

NORTON
How'd that go over?

DAVID
Mrs. Carmody looks at Billy and
says: "These are different atoms,
son. Secret atoms." Then she goes
on a rant about God's punishment
coming down on us. You don't mess
with God's atoms, apparently.

Suddenly, another stream of ARMY VEHICLES goes whizzing by.

DAVID
They're in a big hurry.

NORTON
Maybe their power's out too.

cur TO:
EXT. FEDERAL FOODS MARKET/PARKING LOT - DAY

A supermarket from the '60s, modest by today's standards.
Also: a laundromat, ice cream shop, pharmacy. The parking
lot's jammed. David's Scout appears, turning in...

INT. SCOUT - DAY

-.-.and a BEARDED BIKER ON A HARLEY pops into frame and cuts
them off, startling everybody as David slams the brakes.

NORTON
Jesus! Stupid shit...

The biker pulls ahead, rumbling toward the market. David
resumes cruising for a spot. Billy points:

BILLY
Daddy! Somebody's leaving!

EXT. MARKET/PARKING LOT - DAY

They pull in, a lucky spot close to the
to get a call through on his cell phone
the Scout, gives Norton a look.

market. David's trying
as they get out of

NORTON
No signal?

DAVID
Why don't you get started? I'11 use
the payphone, give Steff a call.

BILLY
Can I go with Mr. Norton, Daddy?
15.

Norton's a bit thrown by this. David hesitates, hands the
list to Billy.

DAVID
Make sure you hold his hand when
you cross.

Billy takes Norton's hand and looks both ways, crossing the
traffic aisle to the market. Norton looks a bit flustered,
but goes with it. Billy turns, calls back to David:

BILLY
Ask Mommy if she wants a Spiderman
comic book! I bet she does!

DAVID
You think? -

Billy nods. David smiles, watches them enter the store.

He goes to the payphone in front of the pharmacy, lifts the
receiver...and gets a "circuit busy" signal: wah-wah-wah-wah.

He clicks the cradle a few times, puts the receiver back with
a sigh, heads toward:

THE MARKET

He almost bumps face-first into the automatic door -- he draws
back, realizing the power's out. He pushes it open manually...

INT. MARKET - DAY

..-and enters to find the store more crowded than he's ever
seen it -- people clogging the aisles, long lines snaking to
the checkout counters. The cashiers are harried, totaling
purchases by hand -- the registers are down.

BUD BROWN (store manager) and OLLIE WEEKS (assistant manager),
are clipping receipts to the customers’ checks or cash, tossing
them in a box. Both men are also bagging, helping out NORM

THE BAG BOY, a skinny 18 year-old with stringy blond hair.

SALLY, a pretty teenage cashier, glances up and sees David
entering.

SALLY
Hey, Mr. Drayton...

DAVID
Sally...you guys look jammed up.

SALLY
Yeah. Half the staff didn't show,
plus the power's out.

DAVID
Thought you had a generator.
16.

SALLY
Only for emergency lights and to keep
the food cold. Everything else, welcome
to the Dark Ages. Bring your checkbook.

DAVID
(smiles, moving on)
Hey, Steff and I want a date night
Thursday. You free to babysit Billy?

SALLY
Heck yeah. I'm there.

David moves to Ollie (wearing a bow tie), who's happy to see
a friendly face.

DAVID
Crappy day, huh?

OLLIE
Oh, man, everybody's pissed off
this morning.
(his gaze shifts)
Oh, great. And now it's complete.

David turns, sees MRS. CARMODY enter. She seems like a nice
(though eccentric) lady at first, but...well, we'll get to
know her soon enough. She's in a canary-yellow pantsuit,
annoyed to see such a long wait at the checkstands.

On she goes,

OLLIE
What do you wanna bet she finds
Satan lurking in the cantaloupes?
{as she draws near)
Good morning, Mrs. Carmody...

MRS. CARMODY
With these lines? I wouldn't say
there's much good about it, but I
guess we'll have to make do.

moving down the aisles.
DAVID
(grins)
Keep your head down, pal.

OLLIE
You know it.

David moves on...

WE FADE TO BLACK and bring up a TITLE CARD:

THE COMING OF THE MIST
17.
INT. MARKET ~ DAY

David finds Norton and Billy in an aisle, items already in
the shopping cart, Norton puzzling over Steff's list.

NORTON
Your wife should have been a doctor, :
David. She could make a fortune in
Manhattan with this handwriting. !

DAVID
I know, takes some getting used to.
(takes the list)

Why don't you get your stuff? We'll :
meet you at the checkout.

NORTON

Done.

Norton grabs a hand-basket from the cart, starts away. He !
pauses, looks back. ;

NORTON
David. Thanks for helping me today.

David nods. Norton turns the corner, gone.
BILLY
Are you and Mr. Norton gonna be
friends now, Daddy?
DAVID
I dunno, champ. "Friends" might be
stretching it. We'll see.

He grabs some items off the shelf, tosses them to Billy, who
relays them into the cart.

BILLY
But I guess you're not mad at each
other any more.

DAVID
I guess not. That's a start.

They proceed down the aisle...

PRODUCE SECTION

Mrs. Carmody is peering intensely (and suspiciously) at a
cantaloupe...

VARIOUS ANGLES

of store activity -- people shopping, maneuvering in the
aisles, trying not to bump carts, cashiers working...
Oe

It's all very...normal. And yet its very normalcy should
unnerve us. (This is very much in the tone of how it's shot.)

CHECKOUT STANDS

Long lines, uncomfortable people, sweaty faces, everybody
enduring the wait. A battery-operated RADIO on the manager's
podium is tuned to that Portland easy-listening station...

DAVID, BILLY, AND NORTON
are in line with their shopping cart.

BILLY
Daddy, look. More Army men.

David glances over, sees THREE ARMY PRIVATES entering the
store: PVTS. WAYNE JESSUP, JOHN BISBY, TIM DONALDSON. They're
in standard (not combat) uniform, bummed to see the long lines.

CLOSER ANGLE ON SOLDIERS

Jessup is a local boy, 19 years-old. The other two are barely
out of their teens. We catch a bit of their conversation:

BISBY
..-bus leaves in forty minutes. . .

JESSUP
+--we'll make it, okay? You guys
get the goodies, I'll get in line...

Bisby and Donaldson move off. Jessup gets in line. Sally the
cashier makes eye contact with Jessup and smiles, a bit flirty.
He smiles back, waves. They obviously know each other.

DAVID'S GROUP

IRENE REPPLER (in the next line) smiles at David and Billy.
She's a teacher at the local grammar school, 60-ish and wiry,
cat's-eye glasses hanging on a chain around her neck.

BILLY
Hello, Mrs. Reppler.

IRENE
Hello yourself, Billy Drayton. How'd
you folks hold up in the storm?

DAVID
Big insurance day. We had a tree
come through the picture window.

BILLY
And the boathouse got all smooshed!
Mr. Norton's tree fell on it!
19.

David glances to Norton, sees his attention on the plate glass
windows at the front of the store. David follows his look...

IRENE
Sorry to hear that. We had damage
at the school, wouldn't you know...

DAVID'S POV

An ARMY JEEP has pulled up outside. A PAIR OF M.P.s get out.

They split up, one of them heading toward the laundromat, the
other coming this way into the market.

TRENE (0.S.)
...that's what we get for not fixing
that roof when we should've, but
with funds being cut every year...

DAVID

wonders what's going on, glances to Private Jessup in line.
Irene keeps nattering, fanning herself with a Magazine:

IRENE
---you'd think educating children
would be more of a priority in this
country, but you'd be wrong...

David notices a beautiful young woman, AMANDA DUMFRIES, a few
lines over -~ she's been overhearing, smiles, glances away.
The bearded biker that cut David off in the parking lot is
standing in line behind her.

Beyond them is Mrs. Carmody, pissed at this long wait. Her
eyes meet David's. He smiles, nods, glances away.

TRENE .
-+-government's got better things
to spend our money on, like corporate
handouts and building bombs...

Suddenly, a POLICE SIREN goes wailing by outside. People crane
to look, curious, not really see ng much.

ANOTHER SIREN swells on its heels. Another police car? A fire
truck? One or two people break out of line, drifting toward
the windows, but still don't see much.

Sally the cashier is craning to see. Bud Brown (the other
store manager) reprimands her:

BUD
Mind what you're doing, Sally.

She flushes, keeps working. David starts catching some tense

conversation between the M.P. and the three young soldiers:
20.

DONALDSON
---oh, c'mon, man...we got ten days’
leave, check our papers...

M.P.
--.look, I told you, all furloughs
are canceled, I don't know why.
(off their looks)

I gotta go check the pharmacy. You
three meet me at that jeep in five
minutes, that's an order...
As the M.-P. leaves, the TOWN SIREN STARTS WAILING, rising and
falling, one of those scary Cold War-era relics that some
small towns use nowadays for volunteer fire departments.

Conversation in the store dies away. Even Irene has fallen
silent and stopped fanning herself, the magazine hovering
near her face. (All we hear now is Johnny Mathis singing
"Misty" on the battery-operated radio.)

IRENE
I wonder if there's a fire...

MAN
Ayuh. Could be one. Saw some live
wires out on Kansas Road, storm
brung 'em down...

DAVID
Kansas Road?

BILLY

Daddy, is there a fire? Is Mommy
all right?

DAVID
I'm sure she is. Don't worry, okay?

Several more people have broken out of line, going to the
windows. A TEENAGER stops at the. glass:

TEENAGER #1
Holy shit...
(turns to his friends)
--guys, you gotta see this...

TWO MORE TEENAGERS (a guy and a girl) break from their group,
coming to the glass.

TEENAGER #2
Whooaaa...

TEENAGER #1
It’s coming right up Kansas Road.
21.

WOMAN
What is it? What's out there?

A MAN IN PAISLEY SUMMER HAT is outside the market, gazing
off. He quickly pops into the store.

PAISLEY HAT
Hey, anybody got a camera?

A ripple goes through the crowd -- if it’s worth taking a
picture of, it must be worth seeing.

BILLY
Daddy, what's happening?

Paisley Hat grabs a disposable camera off a revolving rack
and hurries back out the door...

PAISLEY HAT
Bud, I'11 pay ya later!

BUD
Fred, you can't just take th--

...but the guy's gone.

TEENAGER #1 .
Dude, we gotta check this out...

The kid dashes outside, followed by his friend.

TEENAGE GIRL
Guys, wait..-.hey!

She pauses at the door, uncertain, holding it open.

BEARDED BIKER
Don't let the air conditioning out...

A few people laugh at the wisecrack, but most are concerned:

OLD MAN
What is it? Hey, what's out there?

TEENAGE GIRL
Some kinda...mist.

And David experiences the first real stab of fear. He sees
commotion brewing in the parking lot...people coming out of
the laundromat...a few people running by in panic...

Inside the market the mood is changing, unraveling, curiosity
crystallizing toward concern...the checkout lines are
dissolving as people move toward the windows...

BUD
Hey, hey, ya ain't paid for those!
22.

Saily suddenly finds herself without customers. She drifts to
the windows herself, peering out, and:

SALLY
Oh my God...

People gasp. There's a MAN staggering across the parking lot
toward the store, blood splashing from his nose down his
shirt. People press toward the glass, watching In shock, as:
The man almost falls once or twice, bursts into the store:

BLOODY NOSE
Something in the fog! Something in
the fog took John Lee! Something...

He staggers, woozy, as Ollie helps him sit heavily down on
the 50 pound bags of dog food lining the windows.

BLOODY NOSE
+--something in the fog took John
Lee! And I heard him screaming!

Billy bursts into tears, clinging to David's neck...

BILLY
Daddy, what's that bloody man? Why
is that bloody man?

People are bewildered, confused. A few go outside. Suddenly,
a voice cries out, urgent with fear:

MRS. CARMODY
Don't go out there! It's death to
go out there!

OLLIE

(mutters to himself)
Aw, jeez...

A few people draw away from Mrs. Carmody, avoiding her. The

vibe is turning panicky, and she’s not helping things. Somebody
bumps into David, almost jolting him off his feet, more people
heading outside, as Norton whispers to David:

NORTON
What the Christ is this?

Mrs. Carmody elbows her way toward the front, desperately
trying to warn people, pleading:

MRS. CARMODY
Don't go out there! It's death. I
feel that it's death out there...

Confusion mounts, people crowding to the glass, some heading
out the door. David moves to the windows, holding Billy...
23.

BILLY
Daddy, I'm scared. Can we go home
please?

The daylight outside starts to dim. Johnny Mathis is just
Singing the words "I get Missstyyy..." when the broadcast
suddenly dissolves into static. People are pressing to the
glass, faces stunned. And David gets close enough to see:

The Mist. It glides across the parking lot with lazy speed,
an expanding wall of white. A few people are running from it
as it blots out the blue sky, turning the sun into a faint
silver disc. Another person goes running out the door...

BLOODY NOSE
Don't go out! There's something in
the fog! It took John Lee!

MRS. CARMODY
It's death. Death took your John
Lee. It's death out there.

BEARDED BIKER
Shut up, you crazy old bag...

She whirls on him, her eyes blazing, actually making the big
guy shrink back.

MRS. CARMODY
You'll be next, you don't mind your
Manners.

The people in the store watch spellbound as the cars disappear

row after row, half the lot now gone. David's Scout is parked
near, still visible...

NORTON
Let's. get out of here, David. What
do you say we--

DAVID
No, no, wait. Let's just wait.

A GUY IN A COORS CAP nudges past the people at the door.

" COORS CAP
Screw that, I'm getting to my car.

MRS. CARMODY
No, no, don't, it’s...

But he shoulders the door open and runs. It starts a stampede;
others start pushing their way outside, following.

MRS. CARMODY
---wait, you don't understand!

 
24.

We see Coors Cap get to his El Camino, fumble his keys, trying
to get the door open...as the Mist swallows him.

Beat.

His SCREAMS begin, piercing shrieks that go on and on,
competing with the now-echoey wail of the town siren.

TRENE
Oh my dear Lord...

The people who followed Coors Cap out. suddenly rush to get
back in, the flow reversing at the door, people pushing and
shoving their way back inside. They get the door closed, as:

The screaming stops. In the stunned silence that follows:

MRS. CARMODY
(softly)
It's death.

David sees the Mist swallow his Scout, glide across the traffic
aisle, and press up against the glass...

The market is swallowed. We see only vague shapes out there
now, a few trash cans. The parking lot lamps come on
automatically, adding dim orange halos of light to the murk.
Another scream is heard somewhere, distant as a dream. .

OLLIB
What's going on? What is this?
David tries to speak, but can't even venture a guess. Billy's
clinging tightly to his neck, whimpering:

BILLY
Mommy...

DAVID
She's okay...

An OLD MAN is backing away from the windows.

OLD MAN
It's a pollution cloud. The mills
at Rumsford. Some kinda chemical
explosion, has to be...

And THUD! People SCREAM as the earth shifts under the store
on one side and drops a few feet, a massive crack running

along the floor up an aisle...then boom, the other side of
the store drops along with it and a matching crack explodes
along the ceiling like it might give way above their heads.

Now the front of the store drops on its foundation
glass panels twanging terrifyingly in their fr:
to-ceiling cracks appear, but the glass holds.

. huge plate
ames. Some floor-
25.

The aisle shelves are teetering, almost going over, spilling
contents...we hear bottles breaking all over the store...a
hanging fluorescent ceiling fixture breaks loose on one end,
doing a Tarzan-swing and smashing against the shelves...

Then it's done. People are petrified, breathless, waiting to
see if anything else happens. Off in the distance, the town
siren stops, the wail dying off eerily to nothing. It's like
the outside world just went away. .

A MAN IN SPECTACLES is the first to speak, breathless:

SPECTACLES
Was that an earthquake?

OLD MAN
I tell ya, those goddamn mills blew
up...

OLLIE

Is everybody okay? Is anybody hurt?

Everybody starts breathing again, some sobbing in fear. Billy
starts crying hysterically. David sets him down, trying to
quiet him, as tension spills out all over the store:

BUD
Everybody just stay put, okay? Just
stay inside the store! .

BLONDE WOMAN
I can't stay here. I can't. I gotta
get home to my kids.

MRS. CARMODY
It’s death to go out there!

The teenage girl spins, terrified, yelling:

TEENAGE GIRL
Stop saying that! Stop that crazy
bullshit!

NORTON

Please, everybody! Everybody just
relax, okay?

BUD
He's right! Let's keep cool! Let's
try and figure out what just
happened...

SPECTACLES
I think that was an earthquake. I
really do...
26.

BLONDE WOMAN
I'm sorry. I can’t just stay here.
I gotta get home to my kids.

OLD MAN
Could be a poison gas cloud out
there. Those mills...you heard that
man screaming...

OLLIE
Ma'am, no, you can't go out there.
Not until we catch our breath and
figure things out--

BLONDE WOMAN
You're not listening! I can't stay
here. Wanda's looking after little
Victor...Wanda's only eight...she
sometimes forgets she's supposed to
be watching him, you know? I told
them I'd only be gone for a ‘few
minutes...she's only eight...

She falls silent, desperate and brittle, staring around at
all the faces watching her.

BLONDE WOMAN
Well? Isn't anyone gonna help me?!
Won't somebody. ..won't somebody
here see a lady home?

Nobody speaks. People shuffle their feet, try not to meet her
gaze. A FAT LOCAL MAN takes half a step forward, but his WIFE
gets his arm in a death grip and holds him back.

The blonde woman is looking around, her gaze going from face
to face, near tears.

BLONDE WOMAN

(to Ollie)
You?

(to Bud)
You?

(to Norton)
You?

Norton opens his mouth as if to speak...but hesitates. She
dismisses him with disgust, looks to David.

BLONDE WOMAN
You?

David picks up Billy, pinned in her gaze.
DAVID

Ma'am...I got my own boy to worry
about.
27.
The blonde woman just stares at them all, then:

BLONDE WOMAN
(softly)
I hope you all rot in hell.

And with that, she turns to exit the store. Sally makes a
half-hearted grab for her...

SALLY
Aw, lady, wait...

-.-but the blonde woman shrugs her off, pushes the door open,
steps out. People go to the glass, watching.

The blonde woman takes a deep breath. Then another. The air
does not seem poisoned. She moves slowly off through the Mist,
growing ever more indistinct until...

+++8he's gone. People stand at the glass, staring, too stunned
or ashamed to speak. They start moving away from the windows.

DAVID

carries Billy down an aisle, away from the others, trying to
calm him. The boy is clutching him, sobbing against his neck.

DAVID
It's okay...it's okay now...hey
champ, easy...just breathe...

The boy's sobbing so hard he's having trouble catching his
breath. David paces, rocking him, his heart breaking:

DAVID
-+-¢'mon, Big Bill...you can't keep
crying like this, you're gonna hurt
yourself...just try and breathe...

Billy's sobs start to taper, hitching as he tries to calm
down. Irene and Sally come by, trailed by Amanda Dumfries.

IRENE
Is there anything I can do?

DAVID
No, it's okay, he's gonna be
fine...aren't you, Billy?

SALLY
Hey, Billy, it's gonna be fine.
Okay? Want some juice or something,
big guy?

Billy buries his face miserably into David's neck, his voice
still hitching with sobs, small and mffled:
28.

BILLY
I...1I...w-want m-my m-mommy...

DAVID
I know you do, champ. C'mon now,
try to breathe...

WE FADE TO BLACK AND BRING UP A TITLE CARD:
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE BAG BOY
INT. MARKET (BACK OF THE STORE) - DAY

David's on the floor with Billy's head in his lap. The boy's
sucking his thumb, eyes glazed with exhaustion and shock,
half dozing. David's sick with concern, stroking the boy's
hair. Across from them sit Irene, Sally the cashier, Amanda
Dumfries, and HATTIE TURMAN, an elegantly dressed woman.

DAVID
I haven't seen him suck his thumb
since he was two years old.

AMANDA
He's in shock. I think we all are.

IRENE .
You haven't met. Amanda Dumfries.
Amanda's new in town...she teaches
third grade, and damn well, I might
add...all the kids love her...

David gives Amanda a nod, as:

IRENE
David's an artist. He does movie
posters and such. Hattie Turman,
she’s in real estate. And
Sally...you're a senior now, aren't
you, dear...

SALLY
Yes ma'am.

IRENE
--.and me, good Lord, I'm babbling
like some old biddy at a tea party.
My nerves are all jangled, I guess.

AMANDA
Sorry we couldn't meet under better
circumstances.

Ollie comes by, crouches.

OLLIE
Boy settled down? How is he?
2.

DAVID
He feels hot.

OLLIE
I'll go fetch some aspirin, huh?

DAVID
Thanks. I'11 get something to cover
him up. Got any blankets?

OLLIE
Got some furniture pads out in the
loading dock.

DAVID
Sally, you mind taking him?

Sally reaches over, takes Billy onto her lap. The thumb comes
out of the boy's mouth, his voice faint:

BILLY
Daddy, don't go...

DAVID
I'll be gone two seconds, Big Bill,
get you a blanket. Sally's here.
So's Mrs. Reppler and Mrs. Turman.

SALLY
We got your back, buckaroo... ‘kay?

BILLY
‘Kay.

- Back goes the thumb. David rises. WE TRACK HIM along the back
of the store, passing aisle after aisle, catching glimpses of
the people clustered at the checkout stands b.g.

NORTON
+-no, no, the first thing to do is
keep our wits about us and figure
out what's happened...

BEARDED BIKER
How you propose we do that, my man?
Got no phone signals, got no radio. . -

NORTON
I'm sure that's just temporary.
We're obviously dealing with some
kind of natural disaster here...

MAN
Ain't nothin' obvious about this
sumbitch from where I sit...
30.

ANOTHER MAN
++-nothin' natural about it either...

MRS. CARMODY
It's God's judgment come down at
last. Nothin' more obvious or natural
than that.

BEARDED BIKER
Oh, fuck me...

MRS. CARMODY
(sharp)
Oh, I won't have to, Sonny Jim. You
already did that to yourself with a
life of sin and dissolution...

David goes through a pair of swinging rubberized doors into:
THE LOADING DOCK

Dim in here, lit by a few emergency lights. David takes a few
steps in and recoils -- the room is filling with thick white
smoke, the generator belching exhaust fumes into the air.
Coughing, David grabs a towel, covers his face, moves through
the loading dock filled with shadows and pallets of goods.

David finds the generator in a back corner, occupying its own
steel mesh cage. He ducks in, finds the smoke backing up from
the exhaust vent. He locates the on-off switch, flicks it.

The genny sputters and quits, killing the noise -- and the
lights. David finds himself in total darkness.

DAVID
Oh, shit.

He turns to exit the cage, whacks his head painfully on the
door frame as he does.

DAVID
Shit!

He eases through, trying to find his way in the dark. He trips
over a pallet, gets to his feet, fighting panic now.

He pauses to get his bearings and let his eyes adjust, knowing
he's being irrational, towel still over his mouth.

He sees a source of faint light: lines running along the edges
and bottom of the huge corrugated-steel loading door, the
kind that rolls up on its track when you press the button.

Opposite that, more light spills ve:
swinging doors from the market. He
toward those, trying not to trip...

ry faintly through the
edges slowly and carefully
SL.

A_sly, slithery sound makes him stop dead in tracks.

He stands frozen, eyes wide, listening. Only silence now.

Did he imagine it? He decides his ears were playing tricks on
him, cautiously takes another step...

There's the sound again: something sliiiding veerrrryy
slooowwly in the darkness behind him. Then silence.

David turns, heart hammering in his chest, gaze sweeping the
darkness toward the huge roll-up door. The sound comes again,
louder now, from the other sid

And the corrugated steel of the loading door presses inward,
metal groaning as if some enormous weight were being applied

from outside by some huge moving object.

David backs away, breaks and runs, fleeing through the dark
and hurtling headlong through the swinging doors into --

THE MARKET

-- where he damn near plows right into Ollie Weeks, who was
just about to enter the loading dock with two other men, JIM
GRONDIN and MYRON LAFLEUR. They jump back, startled.

OLLIE
David! Jesus!

DAVID
Did you hear it? Any of you?

OLLIE
What, the generator? We were just
coming to check it out...

Norm the bag boy appears with flashlights, ready to hand them
out. David's freaked, trying to calm down:

DAVID
No, I turned the generator off. The
exhaust was backing up. . nobody
else heard that sound?

JIM
What sound?

DAVID
I don't know...a big slithery
noise...back there in the dark.. eat
the loading door...

The men are trading looks, Jim and Myron especially. They're
a pair of blue-collar guys who work in a garage, and have the
air of veteran know-it-all townies.
32.

JIM
You hear it before the lights went
out...or after?

DAVID
No, only after, but...look, I heard
it, okay?

OLLIE

Nobody's calling you a liar.

DAVID
That's what it sounds like.

JIM
Now don't be thataway, Mr. Drayton.
You had a scare, no doubt. Why not
let’s all go check it out?

IN THE LOADING DOCK

The doors swing open. The group enters, flashlights sweeping
the smoky air. Ollie wheezes, covers his nose and mouth.

JIM
Pretty rank in here. Guess you were
right to shut her down.

The flashlight beams play across the corrugated loading door.
Looks fine. Jim glances to Myron, and it's obvious what they're
thinking: that David's one'a them high-strung, nervous nelly
types. Only Ollie seems to giving any benefit of doubt.

They move toward the generator, flashlights bobbing across
cartons of canned goods, pallets of dry dog food.

Jim and Myron enter the cage, Ollie hovering at their
shoulders. The generator ROARS to life, spewing smoke.

JIM
Whoa, whoa, shut her down! Holy
crow, don't that stink!

The generator dies again. Jim and Myron exit the cage.

MYRON
Something's got that exhaust vent
plugged up from the outside.

: NORM
Get it running long enough to raise
that door a little. I'1l go out and
clear whatever's blocking it.

DAVID
No, you can't do that...

 
Jim's pissed

33.

JIM
Why not?
(to Ollie)
'Lectric door, right?

OLLIE
Well, yeah, but I don't think it's
very wise to send him out there.

MYRON :
(tips his cap back) :
Well, okay. I'll do it. i

i
OLLIE i
No, you don't understand, I really
don't think anyone sh--

MYRON |
Don't worry, I'll get her done. :
What, don't think I can? i

NORM
Hey, I wanna go, it was my idea...

j DAVID |
Whoa, wait, just stop!

(they stare at him)
Jim, right? And Myron? You don't
seem to understand, or you're trying
as hard as you can not to. This is
no ordinary fog, okay? And there
are a lot of people in this market.
I£ you open that loading door and
something comes in...

 

NORM
(snorts)
Like what?
DAVID

 

Like whatever made that noise I heard.
Are you guys being willfully dense?

now, gives David a half bitter/half amused grin.

JIM

Mr. Drayton, pardon me, but I'm not
convinced you heard anything. We're
not hearing anything how. Anybody?

(a quick glance around)
I know you're a bigshot artist with
connections in New York and Hollywood
and all, but that don't make you
better than anyone else, in my
book...
34.

DAVID
I didn't say that...

JIM.
---nor do I like being talked down
to and called stupid just ‘cause
some guy with a college degree has
got the jitters. way I figure, you
got lost in here in the dark, got a
little confused and a little scared.

MYRON
It happens.

OLLIE
Fellas, the generator isn't even
that important, the food'll keep
for days without--

Jim cuts him off brusquely, points to Norm:

. JIM

Okay, kid, you're it. I'11 start
the motor, you raise the door. Give
us a yell when you got enough room.

NORM
Yeah, okay, good.

Norm goes to the loading door. David's just staring at them,
_—== unable to believe he can't talk them out of this.

DAVID
Wait, this is crazy! You're gonna
jet this kid risk his life over a
generator that doesn't even Matter?

NORM

Why don't you just shut the fuck up
already! Jeezus!

JIM
Listen...Mr. Drayton...tel1 you
what. You got anything else to say,
I think you better count your teeth
first, ‘cause I'm tired of listening
to your bullshit.

(glances over)

C'mon, Myron.

They head for the genny. Norm goes to the loading door. David
stunned, tries to go after them -- but Ollie restrains him.

OLLIE
Leave tem be.

,
35.

DAVID
(quiet, tense)
This is crazy, these assholes think
I'm impugning their manhood? what
the fuck is going on here?

OLLIE
They've lost their sense of
proportion. Out there in the market
they were scared and confused...in
here's a problem they can solve, so
goddamn it, they're gonna solve it.

JIM
Ready, kid?

NORM
Yeah, let's rock!

DAVID
Norm, don't. It's a mistake.

Norm turns, eyes shining with excitement and...yes, fear. He
looks like he might actually be having second thoughts, but
then the generator ROARS to life and the decision is made. He
tosses David a look of utter macho 18 year-old contempt.

NORM
Pussy.

Norm stabs the loading door button with his finger,
back to wait. The door starts to rise,
its tracks. Light comes £looding in,

steps
rolling slowly up in
pushing back the shadows.

NORM
Hold. up!

The generator goes off. The door stops about three feet off
the ground. Norm moves forward. Outside, the concrete loading
Platform stretches off into a dull milky haze. Tendrils of

mist come eddying in across the floor, creating an otherworldly
effect. It might as well be a different planet out there.

Jim and Myron exit the generator cage. Norm gets to the door,
ducks down and beers out to make sure the coast is clear.

MYRON
So? Any boogeymen?

NORM

(snorts, glances back)
Yeah, right...

And that's when it ha ens: a long, pale, fleshy pink thing
that looks like a huge obscene worm comes slither:

ing up over
the lip of the loading platform, probing the air.
36.

All the men inside see it. Ollie makes a sound in his throat.
Norm turns, looks down, goggle-eyed, starts backpedaling...

NORM
What the fu--

-+-and THWACK! The membrane lashes forward and wraps around
his ankie -- it's a tentacle! The tip has a flat pad like a
giant squid's, only this pad has a mouth in it bristling with.
tiny black barbed teeth that cut through jeans and flesh.

Norm lets out an inarticulate SCREAM of sheer horror as he
dances hysterically back into the loading dock with the thing
clinging to his ankle, trying to shake it off:

NORM
GET IT OFF! GET IT OFF! CHRIST, GET
THIS FRIGGIN' THING OFF ME!

JIM
(frozen)
Oh my God...

The tentacle suddenly flexes and pulls, jerking Norm's foot
out from under him. He flies back, arms flailing wildly, and
slams flat on his back, cracking his head on the concrete.

The tentacle flexes again, wrapping further up Norm's leg to

get a better grip...and hundreds of tiny sphincter-like mouths’
, are revealed lining the underside of the tentacle, opening
7 and closing hungrily, ti L

tiny barbed teeth gnashing. The tentacle
starts dragging Norm across the £loor toward the door -- he
flops onto his stomach, dazed, fingers clawing the pavement.

NORM
JESUS CHRIST, JESUS CHRIST, GET IT
OFF ME, GET IT OFF ME!

David's the first (and only one) to react -- he lunges forward,
grabbing Norm by the wrist and pulling hard. It's a tug of

war between David and the tentacle, with Norm the bag boy as
prize. Norm's eyes are on him, blubbering with fear:

NORM
Don't let it get me, okay, don't,
okay, don't...
(looks to Jim and Myron)

Help me...help me, ‘you guys, please,
please...

But the others are frozen in shock, their brains gone short-
circuit, unable to process what they're seeing. Myron backs
away, trips over a pallet and lands on his ass, gaping in
incomprehension and terror.

David strains to pull Norm free, their wrists locked. Suddenly,
we hear: more slithering.
37.
ANGLE AT FLOOR LEVEL

Norm takes his eyes off David, turns to look -- as we RACK TO
the loading door b.g. to reveal:

More tentacles rise up just outside, slipping and flopping
and slithering hungr. ly toward us. RACK BACK TO Norm as he
looks back to David, almost imbecilic now with fear:

NORM
+--0h, there's more...there's more...

DAVID
SOMEBODY HELP ME! WHAT THE FUCK ARE
YOU WAITING FOR?

And that's what gets Ollie moving, his feet unfrozen, his

brain in gear. He runs to help, grabbing Norm's other wrist,
the insane tug of war continuin , as:

A second tentacle comes slithering, wrapping now around Norm's
other leg. The barbed pad sinks in, pulls off a hunk of fabric
and flesh. The tentacle rears up and poises in the air with its
prize, then starts feeding -- the mouth-in-the-pad gobbles the
bloody hunk, bobbing Tike a dog scarfing a treat. Below it, the
rows of tiny sucker-mouths lining the tentacle hungrily snap
open-and-shut-open-and-shut, grabbing any morsels that fall...

NORM
Oh! Oh! oh! :

More tentacles come probing. One snatches Norm's apron off,
carries it away like a prize. Another tugs a Converse sneaker

off his thrashing foot and makes off with it. David looks
around, sees: a fir

€ ax enclosed in a glass case on the wall.

DAVID
OLLIE! THE AX! THE AX!

Ollie lets go of Norm, rushes to the wall, and SLAMS his elbow

hard as he can into the glass case -- it doesn't break, but
his elbow almost does. He hisses in pain, clutching it...
OLLIE
OW, FUCK!

He glances back in panic, sees more t
crowding the loading platform outsid

Ollie suddenly clutches his chest, wheezing, unable to breathe!

Heart attack? No -- asthma attack! A bad one! He sees a box
of canned goods, grabs a can of chili, rams it through the
glass -- CRASH! He reaches in, fumbling to retrieve the ax...

entacles appearing,
38.
DAVID AND NORM

David slips and slides in Norm's blood, feet dug in, getting
dragged as Norm is pulled along in fits and starts. Tentacles
are darting, dipping in, nipping pieces out of Norm, ripping
up little hunks of clothing and flesh...

NORM
GAAAAAHHHHHHDD! GAAAAAHHHHHHDD !

Ollie comes staggering in the grip of a full-blown asthma

attack, wheezing like a bellows, fire ax raised high, trying
to get enough aim to whack off a tentacle, Norm gaping up at
this new insanity about to descend upon him. .

Ollie swings the ax down, blade slicing the air, but:

David abruptly loses his sweaty grip, falls back in a sprawl.
The ax nearly takes off Norm's head, barely missing and
slamming concrete as Norm gets yanked away from them...

Norm goes sailing/sliding across the floor, screaming and
writhing wildly, trying to sit up, and:

WHAM! He SLAMS face-first into the bottom of the loading door,
lops onto his back from the recoil. The tentacles flex and
coil, try to jerk him outside, but:

Norm grabs the bottom lip of the door with both hands ina
white-knuckled death grip. The tentacles pull harder, causing
Norm's body to rise off the ground, but he won't let go, he's
doing chin-ups on the door for dear life...
David looks to Ollie, stunned, thinking Ollie's dying. Ollie's
on his knees, gasping, unable to breathe, clutching his chest
and fumbling in his pocket, trying to explain:

OLLIE
---asthma...fuckin' asthma...

David scrambles forward, getting a new grip under Norm's arms,
pulling for all he's worth, screaming with effort...

Ollie comes staggering, taking desperate hits from his inhaler,
also grabbing Norm...

More tentacles are slithering past them, exploring -- a huge
one ripples by them like a gigantic boa constrictor, probing
the pallets of goods. It grabs a 50 pound bag of dog food and
Squeezes, exploding dry kibble all over the room. Other
tentacles descend, mindlessly scarfing it up...

David and Ollie are whining with effort and terror, the loading
door buckling and groaning from the pressure. Norm is gazing
up at them, whimpering, head whipping from side to side as if
to deny that he's being eaten alive, moaning:
39.

NORM
++-don't let it get me...'kay...

A tentacle THWACKS onto one of his hands, RIPS the flesh away
to bone, but still he hangs grimly on. Another rips the skin
and flesh off his bare foot. Norm's past screaming; he's just
letting out long, shivering sobs.

Tentacles come near David's and Ollie's heads, probing the
air, sniffing to see if they're edible. One makes a grab for
Ollie, who bats it away and backpedals, letting go of Norm.

OLLIE
DAVID! DAVID, IT'S NO GOOD!

A tentacle darts and sn

aps at David's face. He also lets go,
in an assholes-and-elbows tangle as
il. Norm is watching them, face drained

David scrambles and grabs a mop handle, prepares to push the
loading door button with it. He looks to Jim, who's watching
with a drugged expression on his face.

DAVID
Start the generator!

No reaction -- Jim just stares at the roiling tentacles, Myron

still sprawled on his ass on the floor next to him. Furious,

David picks up a box of bleach, chucks it hard -- it slams

Jim in the stomach. He grunts, looks .toward them like, huh?
DAVID

START THE FUCKING GENERATOR!

Jim blinks, as if coming out of a daze:

JIM
I'm sorry. How the hell was I
supposed to know? You said you heard
something but I didn't know what
you meant, you. should have said
what you meant better. I thought, I
dunno, maybe a bird or something...

Ollie staggers to his feet and runs to the generator.

Norm is staring at them, holding on, the tentacles ripping at
him, droplets of blood pattering to the floor.

Other tentacles, including a few big ones, are crawling across
the floor, exploring. One gets close to Jim, who steps back
and trips on his ass, joining Myron on the floor. Another
grabs a box marked "Charmin" and squeezes, rupturing it and
sending rolls of toilet paper raining and bouncing everywhere.

The generator ROARS to life.
4u.

David hesitates. Norm's eyes are boring into his, hellishly
aware. He knows what's happening to him, knows what David is
about to do. David stabs the button and the door descends.

 

Norm's grip finally comes loose and he thuds down onto the
loading platform. Then he's slowly pulled away, both hands
(one a skeletal claw) scrabbling weakly on the concrete, eyes
on David, flopping and rolling as he vanishes into the Mist.

The largest tentacle is still playing with toilet paper rolls
when the door comes down, indenting it. The smaller tentacles
go whipping out in the blink of an eye...but the large tentacle
gets stuck, writhing wildly as the door gets hung up, jerking
up and down in its tracks, trying to close.

David grabs the ax, runs over, severs the tentacle in a spew
of brackish blood. The tentacle pulls free, leaving just that
one severed tip flopping on the floor like a fish, and:

The door. Finally. Closes.

Nothing now but the grumble of the generator and David panting
harshly in the aftermath of his exhaustion and terror. Jim
rises unsteadily, takes a couple of steps toward him.

JIM
Look, look...y'gotta understand...

David throws a punch. Jim's too surprised to even duck it.
Whap! Right in the mouth. Blood start to flow.

DAVID
You got him killed! Did you get a
good look at it? Did you get a good
look at what you did?

David vents his rage, throwing punches and landing some solid
ones. Jim staggers back, taking it numbly, in resignation or

penance. Suddenly Ollie's there, pulling David off.

OLLIE
Don't, David. Don't-hit him anymore.
It doesn't solve anything.

DAVID
You two assholes got that kid killed!
And I got his fucking blood on me!

David pulis away from Ollie. He squats, puts his head down,
taking deep breaths. He waits to see if he's gonna black out
or puke, or what. Finally, he looks up at Ollie. Softly:

DAVID
Okay. I'm done.

OLLIE
Good. Good. What's next?
41.

DAVID
Kill the generator. That's the first
thing. .
Ollie goes off to do it.
JIM

Yeah. Let's get out of here. I'm
Sorry about the kid, but y'gotta
understand--

MYRON
Hey, we didn't twist his arm! He
made his choice too!

DAVID
Yeah? He was a kid, he's supposed
to be stupid! What's your excuse?
(off their looks)
Go back in the market, wait for us
by the door. Don't say a word to
anybody. Not yet. .

Jim and Myron shuffle out. The genny dies -- back to darkness.
Beat. David clicks a flashlight on, aiming so Ollie can see.

Ollie looms from the darkness, still not breathing xight,
taking long hits off his inhaler. A long silence as both men
try to absorb what just happened, then:

DAVID
I'm sure Norm the bag boy didn't
expect that to happen when he woke
up this morning.

OLLIE
We have to tell. them. The people in

the market. Stop them from going
outside.

DAVID
They won't believe us.

CAMERA PUSHES IN as Ollie crouches, the flashlight beam turning
their faces into scary Halloween masks floating in the dark.

OLLIE
They have to.

DAVID
I'm not sure I believe it, and I
was here. What we saw...it's
impossible. You know that, don't
you? So how do we convince them?
What do we say? Ollie, what the
hell were those tentacles even
attached to?
42.
They ponder that, as:

WE FADE TO BLACK AND BRING UP A TITLE:

A_DISCUSSION WITH NORTON
INT. MARKET - DAY

David draws near the aisle where the women are looking after
Billy. Amanda appears from the aisle, gasps at the sight of
David -- he's disheveled, bloody. He quickly puts a finger to
his lips in a "don't make a scene" gesture. She leans in.

AMANDA
(quiet, intense)
My God, are you all right?

DAVID
Fine--yeah, fine. Not my blood.
Just wanted to check on Billy.

He looks past her, sees Billy curled up in Sally's lap.

AMANDA
What the hell happened?

DAVID
Gotta handle something first. Please,
just keep your eye on him, okay?

She nods, wanting to ask a million questions, but holding
back. David turns, heads back toward the loading dock where:

We find Jim, Myron, and Ollie hovering by the beer cooler.
Jim and Myron are both already drinking in earnest. Jim's
holding his cold beer to his bruised face and split lip. He
wordlessly offers up the sixpack. Ollie tears one off, cracks

it, starts chugging. Myron hands David a kitchen towel and a
bottle of water so he can clean up. .-

JIM
I'm sorry about Norm. Ain’t makin!
no excuses. Just saying.

DAVID .
We have to tell people. No need to
say how it went down...but we're in
deep shit here, people need to know.

OLLIE
We expect you to back us up.

JIM
Yeah. Yeah, sure. Can't have 'em
just walking out, can we? Like that
lady whose kids were at home. Oh,
Lord, what a mess.
43.

OLLIE
Where do we start? How do we do
this and not cause a panic?

DAVID
Let's quietly tell a few key people,
go from there. You guys are locals,
people from around here are more
likely to take your word than mine.

OLLIE
You're a local too.

DAVID
My family roots, yeah. But I didn't
grow up here, makes me an outsider.
You know damn well it does.

MYRON
What about the out-of-towners? Got
plenty of them in the store.

David sees Norton at the front of the store, looks to Ollie.

DAVID
Brent Norton? He's a New Yorker,
got a lot of respect in this town.
His credibility could be a plus.

OLLIE
Okay, but do it quickly, David. We
have to discuss how to stop those
things from getting in here.

JIM
What do you mean "getting in?" You
guys shut that loading door, right?

OLLIE
Yeah. But the whole front of the
store is plate glass.

CAMERA PUSHES IN as they turn to stare at the windows (which
are fractured with large cracks, remember), their faces going
slack as it sinks in how vulnerable they truly are.

MYRON
(a whisper)
Jesus Christ in haircurlers.

Myron cracks another beer, starts gulping. David heads to:
THE FRONT OF THE STORE

People are restless. Many are at the windows watching the
Mist. David approaches Norton and Bud, eyeing the plate glass,
sick with fear at the thought of what might be out there.
44,

NORTON

David. Where'd you get off to?
DAVID

That's what I need to talk to you

about.

David pulls Norton aside, walking him down the aisle toward
the back of the store:

DAVID
Listen, that guy who came in yelling
about something in the fog getting
his friend...

NORTON
Yeah, they got him quieted down and
tucked away in the Manager's office.
Somebody gave him a valium. He was
scaring people babbling about his
hallucinations...

DAVID
They weren't hallucinations.

NORTON
(stops, staring)
Oh, now, David, don't you get
hysterical too...

DAVID
Brent, listen to me, this is really
important...

OLLIE, JIM, AND MYRON

are watching David trying to convince Norton. From here, it
looks like the conversation's getting heated.

: MYRON
I don't think it's going very well.

David grabs Norton, walks him down the aisle to the others,
Norton getting all blustery and shaking his head:

NORTON
No, no, no, no...

DAVID
Tell him.

OLLIB
It's true.

MYRON
Tentacles. Ayuh.
45.

NORTON
Gentlemen, no. I'm sorry, but I'm
just not that stupid.
(directed at David)

What do you take me for? You think
so little of me?

MYRON
{beery, slurring)
Mr. Norton, lissen, s'like this...

NORTON
It's ridiculous. Bither you're having
me on, or...or you're suffering
some kind of group hypnosis.

DAVID
Come back there with me. I'll show
you the blood. And a chunk of
tentacle on the floor.

NORTON
No.

DAVID
What? What did you say?

NORTON
No. This pathetic attempt at a joke
has gone far enough...
(turns to go, muttering)
-+-and don't I feel stupid? I thought
you were being kind to me today...

DAVID
Brent, look--

David grabs his arm, but Norton pulls out of grasp so hard he
almost loses his balance, along with his temper:

NORTON
No, you look! It's a sick, puerile,
stupid joke! It's a banana skin,
and I'm supposed to slip on it!

OLLIE
Mr. Norton? What reason could we
possibly have?

NORTON

Oh, please. This is payback for
that lawsuit I filed against him.
And you guys are backing him up.

(to David)
Pretty tasteless to use what's
happened here as an excuse to make
an idiot of me...
46.

DAVID
..-that's not what's happening...

NORTON
Winning in court wasn't enough for
you? Now you want to take me back
there to gawk at some 98 cent rubber
novelty while these hicks stand
around laughing their asses off?

MYRON
Hey, you wanna watch who you're
calling a hick, prick.

JIM

Whoa, easy, Myron. Mr. Norton, I
swear, you got us all wrong.

NORTON
None of you are exactly crazy about
out-of-towners, am I right? I've
seen you talking behind my back,
the way you all stick together.
(spins to David)

I'm glad that tree fell on your
boathouse,- you know that? Glad.
Stove it in pretty well, didn't it?
Fantastic. Now get out of my way.

Norton tries to go past, but David grabs him and Norton trips
“—~ into the shelves -- a few bottles fall and break. People are
starting to notice now, drifting this way, as:

DAVID
I know you're scared. I am too. But
there are lives at stake, my boy's
most of all. I need you, goddamn
it, so get your head out of your
ass. I'll drag you back there if 1

have to.

NORTON
GET THE HELL OFF ME! HELP! MAKE HIM
LET ME GO! .

BUD

Hey, hey! What is this?!

Bud is elbowing his way through the gathering crowd. Norton
pulls free, shirt pulled out of his pants, flushed with rage:

NORTON
I'm gonna sue your ass again, you
hear me, Drayton? I'll sue your ass
right off, and then I'll have it
thrown in jail! He assaulted me,
you're all witnesses! He's crazy!
47.

OLLIE
No, he's not. I wish he were, but
he isn't.

Off Bud's look, Ollie turns and yells:

OLLIB
HEY! EVERYBODY IN THE STORE! You
WANNA COME BACK HERE AND HEAR THIS!
IT CONCERNS EVERYBODY!
{to David)
Am I doing all right?

DAVID
Fine.

OLLIE
Mr. David Drayton has something to
tell you! You need to hear it in
case you were planning on leaving!

People gather. Amanda and the other women appear. Sally brings
Billy, the boy confused and rubbing sleep from his eyes, as:

BUD

I don't know what you people think
you're doing, but I can tell you
it's going to be reported to the
Federal Foods Company! All of it:

(to pitie)
You're drinking, for God's sakes!
You want to Iose your job? I'll be
taking down’ names...

(glances to David)
+;-Starting with you! And make no
mistake -- there May be charges!

OLLIE
Fine, Bud, write down your names,
but in the meantime, shut the fuck
up. And listen.

Bud reacts as if slapped, stunned that Ollie just spoke to
him like that. Bud glances to David -- go ahead. David
hesitates, all eyes now on him.

MIKE HATLEN,

DAVID
Okay. Here's how it is. I don't
know what this mist is...but there

are things in it. and they're
dangerous...

one of the town selectmen, speaks up:

MIKE
Things, David? what kind of "things?*
48.

. DAVID

We went back in the loading dock.
Five of us. Jim and Myron...Ollie

and me...Norm, the bag boy. We opened
up the loading door so Norm could

go out and clear the exhaust vent

for the generator. Something came

out of the mist and took him.

BUD
Took him? What do you mean? Where
—
is he?

DAVID
Gone. It killed him. Dragged him
off.
{off their looks)
I can't tell you what it was. All
we saw were tentacles.

This gets a few nervous chuckles, which spurs Norton:

NORTON
Tentacles, he says! The Tentacles
from Planet xX!

(looks to Bud)
It's a lie, you know. These people
just lie each other up. ~

BUD
Of course it's a lie. It's lunacy.
(hollers) :
NORM? WHERE ARE YOU?

Nothing...just silence. People looking nervously around.

OLLIE
You honestly think he’s hiding?
Having a laugh at your expense? Is
that what you truly think, Bud?

ANGLE TO Amanda and Sally, Irene and Hattie. Sally's got her
arms protectively around Billy. Everybody waiting, listening.

SALLY
(getting scared)
NORM?

DAVID
Go ahead. Search the store. You
won't find him.

BUD
{hesitates)
NORM! SHOW YOURSELF! RIGHT NOW THIS
VERY INSTANT!
49.

MRS. CARMODY (0.S.)
Little Normy's gone. Death took
your little Normy.

All eyes turn. Here she comes in her canary-yellow pantsuit.

MRS. CARMODY
You listen but don't hear. You hear
but don't believe. Who wants to go
outside and see for himself?

{looks to David)

And what do you propose to do about
it, Mr. David Drayton? What do you
think you can do about it?

SALLY
Can't somebody make her shut up?

‘MRS... CARMODY
Are you scared, dearie? No, not
yet, but you will be. The End Time
has come. The moving finger has
writ, not in flames, but in mist.
The earth has spewed up Hell's
abominations, and when you see them
face to face, oh then you'll be
scared, yes, scared aplenty when
they drag you off! You'll be with
little Normy soon enough!

OLLIE
(takes her elbow)
That's enough now, Mrs. Carmody .
That's just fine.

MRS. CARMODY
Don't you touch me! It's the end of
everything! It's death!

BEARDED BIKER
It's a pile of shit.

MYRON
Look, mister, don't you think we
know how this sounds? But it's the
flat-out truth. We all saw it.

DAVID
(to Bud)
Don't take our word. Come look.

BUD
Lead the way, Mr. Drayton. Let’s
get this foolishness over with.

David turns, glances to Jim and Myron. They don't want to go,
but they nod in agreement anyway. They all enter:
50.
THE LOADING DOCK

The men enter, flashlight beams sweeping the shadows, faces
Pale and ghastly. Bud's bravado is draining away...once you
get a person in the dark, logic flees. He can see the place
is trashed: boxes knocked over, toilet paper rolls everywhere.

David brings him toward the loading door. Bud's flashlight
beam finds the blood on the floor, a lot of it, long streaks
already turning brown, leading to the big roll-up door...

»+-and there, curled on the ground, is that bit of tentacle,
looking rubbery.

. BUD
{a whisper)
What the hell?

David grabs the mop handle, pokes the tentacle...once, twice.

It moves, making Bud jump, the fragment clenching and
unclenching convulsively, its barbed mouth gaping open as if
sScreaming...then it curls up and goes still again. Now that
it's finally dead, it decays before their eyes at a startling
xate. Bud makes a choking sound of shock and disgust...

IN THE MARKET

+-and they exit. Bud pauses, faces everybody in the store.

BUD
People. It appears we may have a
Problem of some magnitude here.

WE FADE TO BLACK AND BRING UP A TITLE:

THE FLAT EARTH SOCIETY
EXT. MARKET/PARKING LOT - DAY

A DRIFTING SHOT takes us ominously through the Mist, past the
vague shapes of parked vehicles...and the market looms from
the murk, materializing before our eyes as CAMERA MOVES to
the windows to reveal: :

People inside. Piling big 50-pound bags of fertilizer and dog
food like sandbags along the plate glass...

INT. MARKET - DAY

CAMERA HERE IS HANDHELD, DRIFTING AND PROBING, always restless,
always on the move:

WE PULL BACK from DAN MILLER, a middle-aged man on a ladder,
taping the cracks in the glass with packing tape while Jog
AND BUDDY EAGLETON (brothers) hold the ladder.
Db.

ANGLE DRIFTS BACK through a lot of activity -- bag after bag
being laid down, more arriving from the back of the store,
while other items are also gathered and laid out:

Mop handles. Cans of charcoal fluid. Knives. All impromptu

defensive items. ANGLE FINDS Billy -- the boy's in plain view
of his father, being watched by Sally. Nearby, Norton is with
his "group," about ten people who have gravitated to his side.

NORTON
You people are getting stampeded,
don't you see? You have four
witnesses to this supposed event.
One of them I don't trust at all
because he has a grudge against me.
Of the remainder, two are hopelessly
inebriated...

He indicates Jim and Myron, who (yes) are pretty shitfaced by
now and still sucking down the beers.

OLLIE
What about the fourth? I guess that
would make me a flat-out liar.

NORTON
Yes, it would. I find that far easier
to believe than tentacles.

OLLIE
Tell you what, Mr. Norton. Why don't
you go out that door and around
back? There's a big pile of return
bottles Norm and I put out there
this morning. You bring back one of
those bottles...even one...I'11
take off my shirt and eat it.

NORTON
I refuse to be sucked in by your
pathetic delusions. The evidence
here is flimsy bordering on ludi--

DAVID
(cuts him off)
This isn't a courtroom. You're not
arguing a case. And you're not doing
anything but damage talking the way
you are.

NORTON
And you can throw as much cow's
blood around the loading dock as

you want, you're still not fooling
anybody...
$2.

OLLIE
Leave it alone, David. You can't
convince some people there's a fire
even if their hair is burning. Denial
is a powerful thing.

: NORTON
This is absolutely moronic.

Norton withdraws in disgust toward the back of the store.

NORTON
Anybody who wants to discuss this
rationally to find a means of rescue
are welcome to join me. Those who
want to take part in his travesty,
go right ahead. I'11 have no part of
it, nor would any thinking person.

ANGLE SHIFTS (remember, CAMERA is drifting, restless, on the
move) to Mrs. Carmody eyeing them, sucking on a Tootsie Pop:

MRS. CARMODY

Keep thinking, Mr. Lawyer. There is
no defense against the will of God.
No court of appeals in Hell.

(to David)
No defense here, neither. Not with
all the bags of fertilizer in the
world, not even if you stack 'em
high as that prideful tower in Babel.
They all just bags of shit now,
ain't they?

AMANDA
I guess you'd be the expert on that.

Dan enters frame, Joe following through with the ladder.

DAN
Got those windows taped up. Perhaps
it'll do some good.

David and Ollie trade a look -- they can’t believe that, but

don't want to be discouraging either. Amanda is the only one
who catches it. She draws closer:

AMANDA
That bad?

David just give her a subtle nod -- yeah, that bad.

MRS. CARMODY
I have seen the signs. I have read
the Revelations. There are those
here I have told, but ain't none so
blind as those who will not see.
53.
She moves to the windows, pointing out at the Mist.

MRS. CARMODY
"And the temple was filled with the
smoke from the glory of God, and
from his power; and no man was able
to enter the temple till the plaques
of the seven angels were fulfilled."

MIKE :
Well, what are you saying? What are
you proposing?

MRS. CARMODY
Proposing? Why, I am proposing that
you prepare to meet your maker,
Michael Hatlen!

MYRON
Prepare to meet shit! Woman, your
tongue must be hung in the middle
so it can run on both ends!

Myron's advancing on her, but Jim restrains him. ¢

JIM
Come on, pal, easy now...

People are pausing now, drawn to the confrontation, as:

MRS. CARMODY
Doubters will doubt to the end! Yet
a monstrosity did drag that poor
boy away! Things in the mist! Every
abomination out of a bad dream!
Eyeless freaks! Pallid horrors! Do
you doubt? Then go out! Go on out
and say howdy-do!

 

A LITTLE GIRL bursts into tears, buries her face against her
FATHER'S leg. The adults are either disgusted or fascinated,
but all are silent and listening now.

FATHER
Shut up, lady, God's sakes.

David glances over, sees Billy peering with wide eyes.

DAVID
You'll have to stop now, Mrs.

Carmody. You're scaring the children.
My little boy.

MRS. CARMODY
The children should be scared. Oh
yes they should. Their heads been
(MORE)
54.

MRS. CARMODY (CONT'D)
filled with lies, all this talk of
modern God. Only one true God, the
God of the Israelites. He’s a stern
and vengeful God, and we been mocking
Him far too long. Now he’s calling
us to pay our debt in blood.

AMANDA
Blood?

MRS. CARMODY

That's right missy thing, blood.
Like what trickles down your leg
once a month. Why you think God
gave women the curse? As a reminder.
But that's just been a downpayment.
Now we pay the rest.

(looks around)
Read the Good Book! It calls for
blood! Expiation! Sacrifice!

Amanda steps up calmly and slaps her hard across the face.

AMANDA
You shut up that bad talk.

Mrs. Carmody touches a hand to her mouth, finds a little blood
there. It makes her smile...and she holds it up for all to
see. Amanda backs away, realizing just how crazy she is.

AMANDA
Sorry, folks. This lady's perspective
on things is a little too Old
Testament for my Lutheran tastes.

SALLY
She had it coming! I'd have done it
myself!

Carmody singles Sally out, drifting ominously toward her.

MRS. CARMODY
They'll get hold of you. Not today.
Maybe tonight. When darkness comes.

Sally shies back. Carmody turns slowly, addressing them all
now, eyes going from face to face.

MRS. CARMODY
They'll come at night, and take
someone else. See if they don't.
And when they do, when you're next,
then you'll come weeping to me.
You'll beg Mother Carmody to show
you what to do.
DD.

OLLIE
That's fine, but until then, if you
don't shut up, we'll wrap some of
this tape around your mouth.

MRS. CARMODY
You try it, Ollie Weeks.
(turns to Amanda)
And you, bitch. Hit me again if you
dare. You'll be on your knees to me
before it's through.

She plants her Tootsie Pop back in her mouth, drifts quietly
off. People get out of her way. ANGLE FINDS one terrified
WOMAN, pale and watching...already believing.

FAVORING DAVID

as the moment ends, everybody around him freaked-out and grimly
silent as they drift off to resume their preparations.

OLLIE
Those of you who aren't locals should
know that Mrs. Carmody is well known
in town for being unstable.

BEARDED BIKER
No shit. What was your first clue?

MIKE
Okay, we can use the charcoal fluid
and mops to make torches. And we
got knives and such, God knows.

AMANDA
Which God, hers? He likes knives,
apparently...

DAN

This may be a silly question, Bud,
but you don't happen to have a gun .
in the store?

BUD
Please. This isn't Dodge city. or
Los Angeles.

An old man, AMBROSE CORNELL, pipes up:

AMBROSE

Got a shotgun in my truck. I could
try for it, if you want.

DAVID
I don't think that's a good idea,
Mr. Cornell.
56.

AMBROSE
I don’t either, son, but I thought
I'd offer.

DAN

Well, I didn't think so...

AMANDA
Hold on a minute.

All eyes turn to her. She looks very self-conscious as she

opens her purse, digs around, and pulls out a small Smith & LD
Wesson J-frame revolver. i

" AMANDA :
This gun...my husband's idea. :
(embarrassed) i

He insisted. He's away on business |
a lot. It's not even loaded. :

AMBROSB |
So what good is it?

She goes into her purse again, brings out two plastic speed-
loaders, each containing six rounds.

DAVID
You know how to use it?

AMANDA _
I shot it only once, on a target
range.

Dan takes the gun, manages to fumble the cylinder open.

MIKE

Okay, we got a gun. Who knows how
to shoot it? Well, I mean.

People glance around at each other. Then, reluctantly:

OLLIB
I do.

BUD
You? You'll be too damn drunk to
see before dark.

OLLIE
(ignoring him)
I've done a lot of target shooting.
I was state champion back in '94,

David gives Ollie a look -- the little assistant manager is
full of surprises. Ollie takes the gun, loading and handling
it with deft expertise. He cracks the cylinder, applies the
speed-loader, shuts the cylinder with a flick of his wrist.
57.

DAVID
Okay. You're in charge of the gun.
(to Amanda)

If that's okay?

Amanda nods, relieved. Mike and Dan move off to help the others
piling the bags, while:

David goes to Billy and Irene. The boy's eating a Hershey
bar. David kneels, puts his hand on Billy's forehead.

DAVID
Feeling better, champ?

BILLY
(nods solemnly)
How come nobody. comes and rescues
us? Why don't those Army men call
their friends to come get us?

David glances over, sees Bisby, Jessup, and Donaldson apart
from everybody else, having some kind of quiet but heated
debate -- in fact, they seem on the verge of an argument.
David finds it odd, but doesn't give it that much thought .

DAVID
I don't know.

BILLY
You think Mommy's okay?

DAVID

Billy, I just don't know. I wish I
did, but I don't.

BILLY
(eyes brimming tears)
I want her awful bad. I'm sorry
about the times I was bad to her.

David hugs him, pulls him close.

DAVID
Mommy loves you, Billy. And I bet
she's fine. I promise you I'm going
to do everything I can to get us
back to her, okay? That's all you
have to think about.

Billy nods, miserable. David feels helpless,
wanting to believe it himself. He looks up at
Sally's trembling, tears running down her face

desperately
Sally and Irene.

DAVID
Sally? Your folks still in Boston?
58.

SALLY
Yeah. Till next week. So I guess
they're okay.

IRENE
I'm sure they are. You just be strong
for them, dear.

Suddenly, RAISED VOICES are heard coming this way:

JOE (0.S8.)
You're crazy if you go out there!

NORTON (0.S.)
Let us pass! Let us pass, please!

David rises. Norton and his group (now on

ly five people) appear
with Joe dogging them, Mike joining in:

MIKE
Wait, please, let's talk this thing
through...

NORTON

We have, and we've made our decision. ‘
We're leaving.

DAN
Whoa, now, hang on! Mike's right,
we can talk it over, can’t we? Mr.
Mackey's gonna barbecue some chicken
on the gas grill, we can all sit
down and eat and just--

NORTON
And let you go on talking? I've
been in too many courtrooms to fall
for that. You've psyched out half a
dozen of my people already.

MIKE
"Your" people? What kind of talk is
that? They're people, that's ali.
You want to get ‘em killed? There
are, for want of a better word,
things out there in the mist--

NORTON

Things, you say. We've been here
since this morning, and I have yet
to see a "thing." Nor has anybody
else, and people have been staring
out at that mist for hours.

(looking around)
Who has yet to see one?
59.

JIM
Back in the loading dock, jackass,
dig the wax out of your ears!

NORTON
No, no, no! That ground has been
covered and covered!

(turns)

Listen, everybody! We have
experienced some sort of natural or
manmade disaster! That's all! The
only way we can help ourselves is
to seek rescue! We're going out!

: IRENE
No! You can't!

One of Norton's group, an ELDERLY WOMAN, faces them:

ELDERLY WOMAN
Will you restrain us? Will you?

The challenge is clear.. -use force or let them go. Softly:

DAVID
No. No, ma'am, I don’t think anyone
will restrain you. Brent, listen...

NORTON
I'm not discussing this further.
Certainly not with you.

DAVID
I know. I'm just asking a favor.

Off Norton's questioning look, David grabs a package of white
clothesline from all the supplies that have been gathered.

DAVID
Will you tie this around your waist?

NORTON
What in God's name for?

DAVID

It'll tell us you got at least three
hundred feet.

Something flickers in Norton's eyes -- a hesitation, like
Norm had before he opened the loading dock door. But then:

NORTON
No. I will not.

BEARDED BIKER {O.S.)
I'll do it.
60.
All eyes turn.

MIKE
You throwing in with him?

BEARDED BIKER

Me? No thanks. I think your man
there's a little too tightly wound.
Gonna get somebody killed.

(to Ambrose)
I'm thinking we could use that
shotgun of yours. I saw where you
parked when I pulled in. Red pickup,
right? Far entrance.

Ambrose weighs this, digs his keys out, offers them.

AMBROSE
You got brass balis, son. Shells
are in the glove compartment. You
can drive back. Pump the pedal three
times to get ‘er started.

The biker takes the keys, ties the clothesline to his belt
(which has a huge "Live Free Or Die” buckle). Norton's
bristling, but has no choice.

OLLIE
You want a knife?

The biker lifts his shirt, reveals a buck knife in a scabbard.

BEARDED BIKER
Got one. You just see to paying out
that line. If it binds up, I'11 cut
‘er loose. Just so you understand.

Davia nods. He turns to Norton, holds out his hand.

DAVID
Brent. Good luck, man.

Brent just stares at David's hand like it's a foreign object.

NORTON
We'll send back help.

Norton goes to the door,

pushes it open, steps out. The others
in his group file out aft

er him...except one MAN, who freezes.

Norton glances back at him. The guy just shakes his head,
backs away in fear. Norton dismisses him in disgust.

The biker pauses at the door, looks back at Mrs. Carmody.
61.

BEARDED BIKER
Hey, crazy lady. I believe in Goa,
too. I just don't think he's the
bloodthirsty asshole you make Him
out to be.

MRS. CARMODY
Take it up with the Devil when you
Grop in on him. Chew it over at
your leisure.

She gives him a chilly smile. He just turns, exits.

MRS. CARMODY
They'll die out there. Mark me.

Norton's group starts off. People crowd to the windows, peering
over the "sandbags," watching. David and Ollie pay out the
clothesline, keeping it from tangling.

The group gets indistinct very quickly...then vanishes from
sight, swallowed by the Mist

Silence now. Tension thick. People straining to see or hear
anything. The only sound is the clothesline quietly reeling
out, rubbing softly against the door jamb.

The seconds tick by. The line keeps being drawn out, foot
after foot, yard after yard

It suddenly stops, goes slack in David's hands. Pause.

It starts again. Everybody remembers to breathe. The rope
keeps going, at least two hundred feet of it now gone, closing
in on three quarters. People are starting to get hopeful..

OLLIE
{a whisper)
They're doing good. Real good.

-+-and suddenly the line is yanked taut. Davia screams as it
rope-burns through his hands, whipsaws erazily from side to
side in the door, goes still, starts whizzing out again. David

is holding on, getting dragged, Ollie grabbing him and trying
to hold him back...

FAINT, DISTORTED SOUNDS come wavering out of the Mist, weird

and surreal: distant hellish screams, somebody yelling, a few
snatches of words...

ELDERLY WOMAN (0.S.)
--off me--oh Lord--off--

And now come other sounds, weirder by far: a long,

Ww unearthly
HOWL gives way to deep snufflings and savage,

tearing GRUNTS...
oz.

David yells, feet dug in, others jumping in to help, keeping
him from being pulled out the door...

And the line abruptly goes slack out there. They fall back in
a tangled heap. A final distant HOWL dies away to nothing...
David scrambles, pulling the line in as fast as he can, trying

to find the end of it. It piles up at his feet, the rope
turning red as it's reeled in, soaked with blood, and:

Here come the biker's legs getting dragged across the pavement
Tike a huge piece of bloody bait, the rope still looped through
his belt...but that's all that's left of him. Everything above
the waist is bitten off, gone.

AMANDA
(near tears)
Oh, God, close the door!

Myron slams the door, face white, scared sober. Nobody speaks

in the long, shocked silence that follows, except:

MRS. CARMODY
(placid, quiet)
Now do you see? Now do you believe?

WE FADE TO BLACK AND BRING UP A TITLE:

WHEN DARKNESS CAME
INT, MARKET - DAY/DUSK

Battery-operated Coleman lanterns are being switched on and
set out, people's faces harsh and colorless in the glare...

TRACKING SHOT brings us along the sentries stationed at the
barricaded plate glass, eight men peering out. Improvised
weapons are close at hand, including several mops with their
heads sitting in buckets of charcoal fluid.

Outside, all is Mist. Night is coming, deepening the shadows,
wrapping the store in a shroud. The sodium vapor lamps in the

‘parking lot look like eerie, distant planets in the gloom.

Ollie's at the end of the sentry line, peering out, gnawing a
chicken leg. Suddenly, a shadow seems to glide past out there.
He pauses, blinks, rubs his eyes. He glances over, sees Dan
staring at him, gives him a strained smile.

OLLIE
You stare at something long enough,
your eyes play tricks on you.

DAN
(softly)
I saw it too.
DO.
O£f Ollie's look, we go to:
INT. EMPLOYEE LOUNGE - DAY/DUSK
"Lounge" is overstating things -- it's little more than a

coffee room with a few lockers, a table and chairs, vending
machines, faded safety posters on the walls.

CAMERA DRIFTS ominously, finding Sally. She's at her locker,

uniform hung up, gym bag at her feet, just pulling on her
jeans. She seems very vulnerable in here ail alone.

She gets her sneakers on, grabs her gym bag, heads for the
exit, comes around the lockers --

Somebody's there. She stifles a scream, drops her bag.

It's Jessup, the young soldier she was smiling at earlier at
the checkstands when he first came in.

SALLY

Wayne. Jesus. You scared the shit
out of me.

JESSUP
Sally--I'm sorry. Really. My bad.
(hesitates)
I...I saw you come in here. 1
thought. ..thought I'd come in and
say hi. See how you're holding up.

SALLY
Barely. How about you?

JESSUP

Worried about my folks, I guess.
You know they live up on Shoreham
Road...less than five miles from
here. This mist...who knows how far
“it's spread...

(pause)
What about yours?

SALLY
They're out of town right now.

JESSUP
That's lucky. Means they're okay.

Sally nods, trying to keep it together.

SALLY
How soon you shipping out?

JESSUP
Couple of weeks.
64.

SALLY
You scared about going over there?

JESSUP
Yeah. Sure I am.

Their eyes meet. Pause. We feel the weight of things between
them that have been left unsaid for a long time.

SALLY
Wayne? How come you never asked me
out? We flirted all through high
school. I know you like me. So how
come you never asked me out?

JESSUP
Dunno. I always wanted to. Stupid,
I guess.

She kisses him. It turns passionate. They start getting carried
away...but she stops, pushes him away...

JESSUP
(backs off)
++-shit, I’m sorry...
SALLY
+--mo, don't be, it's just...

(beat)
Shit. I don’t want it to happen
Tike this. Not in a shitty locker
room at work. It's not exactly the
way I always imagined it, y'know?

JESSUP
(nods, beat)
Let’s just stay in here a while,
then...okay? Just the two of us?

She lays her head on his shoulder...
INT. MARKET - DAY/DUSK

--.and we find David's group sitting in an aisle: Billy,
Amanda, Irene, Hattie. They're having a desultory meal of
grilled chicken. Hattie's got Billy, clinging to him. David
can't help noticing she's tense, verging on hysterical. He
tries a tactic to get Billy out of earshot for a moment:

DAVID
Hey, you gotta eat, big guy. Keep
your strength up.

BILLY
I'm not hungry.
65.

DAVID
Well, maybe you'd bring me some
more, huh? Go back there and get me
some from Mr. Mackey, okay?

AMANDA
I'll go with you, Billy. Would that
be okay?

BILLY
"kay.

David gives Amanda a grateful look. She rises, takes Billy's
hand, heads toward the back. David looks to Hattie.

DAVID
You gonna keep it together?

HATTIE
How bad will it be tonight?

DAVID
Hattie, I just don't know.

HATTIE
You let me keep Billy as much as
you can. Okay? David, I'm...I think
I'm in mortal terror. Yes, I believe
that's what it is. But if I have
Billy, I think I can be all right.
I can be all right for him.

IRENE
We're all terrified, dear. There's
no shame in it.

: HATTIE
I'm so worried about my Alan. The
iast I saw him, he was out back
mowing the yard. He's dead, I think.
In my heart, I'm sure he's dead,

DAVID
You don't know any such thing.

HATTIE
What about Steff, David? Don't you
have some feeling about...about
whether she’s all right?

DAVID
It's killing me not knowing. That's
why I'm gonna keep it together and
not give up hope. So I can get us
back to her, me and my boy. That's
all that matters.
66.
Suddenly, Ollie's there, beer in hand, crouching down:

OLLIE
There are things moving around out
there.

DAVID

What do you mean?

OLLIE
Shadows. Things in the mist.
(off David's look)
i'm not drunk. I've been trying,
believe me. Wish I could. 1 thought
my eyes were playing tricks, but
Dan saw it too. So did Arnie Simms.

Ollie tosses a careful look over his shoulder at Mrs. Carmody.
She's. sitting by herself, eating chicken Yavenously with her
hands, surrounded by bones like some cannibal queen.

OLLIE
That woman is nuts, but she may be
right about one thing...I think
those things out there get more
active when it gets dark.
(checks his watch)
Daylight's just about gone.

David looks up, sees Billy and Amanda returning up the aisle,

Billy carefully carrying a plate of chicken. David smiles,
sees the boy munching a leg.

AT THE BARRICADE

GORDON ENNIS is manning his post, eyes glazed from boredom
and exhaustion. He clicks on one of the Coleman lanterns so
he can see, takes his eyes off the Mist long enough to snag a
piece of chicken, turns his eyes back to the window...

+--and a flying thing comes right out of the Mist and SLAMS
to the plate glass with a LOUD THUMP, attracted to the light,
clinging there before his eyes. Gordon jerks back...

DAVID'’S GROUP

+:-and Amanda freezes as Gordon's SCREAM erupts from the front
of the store. Billy drops the Plate, food all over the floor
and his sneakers. David and Ollie jump to their feet --

DAVID
Hattie! Watch Billy!

~~ and they burst from the aisle to see Gordon staggering
away from the barricade in terror, fleeing toward the back.

Sally and Wayne Jessup come running from the employee lounge,
see David and the others racing toward:
67.
THE BARRICADE

People come crowding. And what they see clinging to the glass
blows their minds with shock and disgust: a s ented BUG
about two feet long, eight legs holding the glass with sucker
pads, asymmetrical clusters of eyes revolving on individual
stalks, clear membranous wings flexing wetly, a barbed stinger
where the sexual organ might be.

AMANDA
Oh, God...

As they watch, more of the bugs come flitting out of the Mist, |
thump-thump-thumping to the glass, clinging there...a swarm :
of them, varying in size from one to two feet, milling .
aimlessly, crawling over one other, dumb as houseflies.

Mrs. Carmody comes strolling with a chicken leg in hand, i
licking grease from her fingers, eyes gleaming.

MRS. CARMODY
"And there came out of the smoke
locusts upon the earth, and unto
them was given power, as the
scorpions of the earth have power."
(a whisper)
Wow. Look at those stingers.

Ollie reaches up, gently taps the glass. A bug takes off,
then lands again. Other people start tapping the glass; making
the swarm flit off, but they always come back, settling. :

AMANDA
(realizing)
The light. I think they're attracted
to the light.

OLLIE
Maybe we should douse the--HOLY SHIT!

=

iis words are lost as a bigger and more awful thing appears:

We'll call it a "bird" -- it's like a pelican in size, but a
miniature pterodactyl designed by Hiernyomus Bosch in looks:

a sharp triangular head with diseased orbs for eyes, a beaked
snout snaggly with teeth, flapping leathery wings. It snatches
a bug off the glass and tosses its head back, scarfing and
gobbling, the bug squirming dow its gullet. The creature
then flaps off and vanishes as abruptly as it appeared.

A long beat of frozen silence, and then:

Suddenly, more "birds" appear,

feeding frenzy. They start THUMPING the glass, crashing into
it -- WHAM, WHAM, WHAM! The glass starts eracking from the
repeated impacts, threatening to give way.

swarming like seagulis in a
os.

Utter pandemonium ensues: people screaming, some sobbing,
many running to the back of the store.

DAVID
DOUSE THE LIGHTS!

People scatter in all directions to extinguish the lanterns,
some pressing their hands against the glass to keep it from
imploding, everybody yelling at once.

IN AN AISLE

Hattie screams as a flood of people rush past toward the back,
protecting Billy from the stampede. An OLD LADY falls right
in front of them, screaming as she gets run over.

AT THE FRONT

THUMP, THUMP, THUMP -- the pterodactyl-birds are striking the
windows, glass cracking and crazing under the assault, and:

WHAM! One of them hits the glass and a corner chunk of window
falls in, smashing on the ground -- a hole is now Opened up.

A BUG scurries through, comes down the glass and onto the
bags of fertilizer. A sentry, TOM SMALLEY, gapes up at it in
horror, smashes it with a mop handle. The bug falls writhing
to the floor. Smalley slips, goes to his knees, whacking it
over and over, trying to kill it, as ANGLE WHIPS TO:

David dunking a mop into a bucket of lighter fluid, yelling:

DAVID
OLLIE, WE GOTTA PLUG THAT HOLE!

They look over, see Smalley whacking the bug, but:

 

Above him, more bugs are entering, climbing ovt across the
barricade bags, taking to the air, swarming. People are running
and screaming, trying to kill them with mop handles. .

Amanda's in the thick of it, swinging a garden rake. She
impales a bug in mid-air, slams it to the ground, whacks it
to pieces. She ducks as another bug whizzes past her head
like a huge hornet, heading towara Sally...

AMANDA
SALLY, LOOK OUT!

+-but Sally turns too late, the bug ramming its stinger deep
in her neck. She SCREAMS and falls to the floor, trying to
tear it away. People rush in, including Jessup, flailing with
jackets and stomping the bug, as ANGLE WHIPS BACK TO:

David, as he sees: a 50-pound bag of fertilizer at the top of
Smalley's barricade is shifting, about to fall.
DAVID
SMALLEY, LOOK OUT, HEADS UP!

But Smalley never even hears him -- the bag slides, SLAMS
down on his head, lays him out cold, as:

A _pterodactyl-bird pokes through the opening in the glass,
beak gnashing. It scrambles through, wings folded, perch. ng

on the bags like a gargoyle.

AMANDA
SHOOT IT! SHOOT IT!

OLLIE
I CAN'T! I'LL HIT THE GLASS!

DAVID
GIMME A LIGHT! I NEED FIRE!

Joe Eagleton comes running with his Zippo lighter, fumbling
the wheel, getting sparks but ho flame, as:

The "bird" tilts its head, eyeing Smalley unconscious on the
£loor below it. The creature hops down onto Smalley's back,
landing in a flap-and-flutter of wings, and then:

To everybody's horror, the creature dips its head and rips

Smalley's neck away in a gout of blood with its beak, shrieking
as it throws its head back and starts to feed...

Amanda grabs a three-pack of disposable lighters from the
impulse rack, desperately trying to rip the package open, as:

A second "bird" comes through the hole, flapping into the air
over their heads and sailing down an aisle. Ollie turns and
runs after it, gun aimed, trying to get a clear shot...

Amanda gets a lighter out, tosses the remainder of the package
to Joe. She starts desperately trying to get a flame, but:

AMANDA
Goddamn child-proofing sons of
bitches!

She gets a flame, thrusts it. David's mop erupts in flames,
WHOOSH, instant torch. 7

He rushes forward, jabbing the flaming weapon at the monster
feeding on Smalley. The creature shrieks and flaps, fighting
back, clawing the air in fury, gobbets of bloody flesh caught
in its teeth.

fluid from a can. The fluid sprays the monster, soaking it,
kes to the

 
WU.
SALLY

lies convulsing on the floor, the sting from the bug swelling
her neck up to twice its size, face and neck going black and
blue, dying horribly before our eyes, Jessup kneeling in a
helpless white-hot panic, grabbing her flailing hand...

JESSUP
-.-don't do this, Sally, don't do
this, you're gonna be okay...

ANGLE WHIP-PANS with Joe as he runs to a mop standing ina
bucket of charcoal fluid, frantic. He pulls the mop, ignites
it with a Bic -- WHOOSH, up it goes -- but he trips on the
bucket and goes sprawling, lighter fluid everywhere, and:

 

WHOOM! He's caught in a fiery explosion, FIREBALL rising to
the ceiling, Joe writhing and screaming in the flames. Men
come running, trying to slap out the flames with furniture
pads, everybody screaming, sheer chaos:

MIKE
WHERE ARE THE GODDAMN EXTINGUISHERS?

DAVID

ducks as pterodactyl-bird #1 flaps past his head wrapped in
£lames, dropping burning pieces of itself. David pursues it
with his mop, the creature shrieking and burning and bashing
into shelves, bringing down cans and jars. David chases it
down, smacks it to the floor, beating it to death, while:

OLLIE

races down the aisles, yelling for people to get down, trying
to get a clear shot at Bird #2 as it shrieks and flaps through
the air. Somewhere, Mrs. Carmody is screaming, exultant:

MRS. CARMODY (0.S.)}
"...a great voice from the temple
Saying to the seven angels, go your
ways, and pour out the vials of the
Wrath of God upon the earth..."

Ollie almost gets a shot off, but a SHRIEKING WOMAN with a
toddler suddenly pops up in his sights -- he barel manages

to avoid shooting her, holds his fire as the "bird" rises up,
circling off over the aisles...

POV OF BIRD #2

zooming in flight over the store, passing the aisles below,
people running and screaming, and our POV soars over Mrs.
Carmody gazing up and shouting:
71.

MRS. CARMODY
"..,and there fell a noisome and
grievous sore upon men which had
the mark of the beast..."

FRONT OF THE STORE

Men blast the flames with extinguishers. David runs in, pulis
Joe from the fire, Amanda smothering his flames, while:

THE HOLE IN THE WINDOW

CAMERA PUSHES IN as a monstrous CENTIPEDE pokes its head over
the lip, squirms through, its million scrambling legs rattling
over the bags and down the front of the barricade and onto:

THE FLOOR

It comes fast toward us, the size of a huge boa constrictor,
mandibles clacking, streaming up the aisle toward:

Billy. Held by Hattie Turman. Both frozen in utter shock and

terror, mouths gaping in silent screams as the huge centipede-
thing bears down on them like a speeding train.

Suddenly, Irene Reppler lunges into frame, bellowing like a
lunatic, a can of Raid (the big size) in each hand. She sprays
the centipede-thing right in the face. It recoils, chittering
and convulsing as she coats it with insect killer.

Irene strikes a wooden kitchen match, using it to turn a can
of Raid into a flamethrower -- WHOOOSH! The centipede bursts
into flames, whipping and convulsing as it gets barbecued.
Irene goes marching up the aisle toward the front of the store,
grabbing a cheap tennis racket from a display as she goes.

THE FRONT OF THE STORE

The men are reeling, scrambling to plug that hole in the glass.
David jams a mop handle up there, shoving hard to keep a third
screeching, flapping pterodactyl-bird from getting in.

DAVID
HELP! WE GOTTA PLUG THIS HOLE!

A BUG suddenly scurries from behind the bags, skittering onto
his arm and poising its stinger. David SCREAMS, but can't let
go of the mop or the "bird" will get in. Suddenly:

Irene appears at David's side, blasting the bug with Raid. It
reels back and she whacks it to paste with the tennis racket
for good measure, screaming at the men:

IRENE
PLUG THE GODDAMN THING!
tae

Mike, Dan, and a few others come running with a sheet of
plywood, struggle it up onto the barricade, lay it flat against
the glass, Dan taping it in place like mad, while:

PRODUCE SECTION

A MAN runs as pterodactyl-bird #2 comes flapping up behind
him and slams him to the floor. The man struggles, SCREAMING
as the creature tries to tear his face off, and:

BLAM! A bullet smacks through the creature, flipping it off
the man. The monster shrieks, struggling to rise. Ollie, down
at the far end of the aisle, FIRES again and blows the thing's
head apart. It dies in a thrashing heap.

FRONT OF STORE

The last few lanterns are doused, plunging the store into
final darkness. All we're left with is the faint, otherworldly
sodium-vapor glow seeping in from the parking lot lamps, as:

CAMERA DRIFTS PAST their faces...dazed disbelief, bone-deep
shock...past Tom Smalley lying facedown and dead in a pool of

blood...past Joe on the floor, moaning with third-degree burns,
charred hands looking like claws...

JOB
-.-0h God...I'm hurt...ain'’t I hurt
bad, though...oh God...

...and we come to Sally, dead and staring, neck horribly
swollen, Jessup weeping over her. David's on his knees at

Joe's side, staring at Sally, aghast. He looks up, meeting
Amanda's gaze, as:

. TERRIFIED WOMAN
She was right. She said it would
happen like this. She said they'd
come at night. She told us that
girl would die.

All eyes go to Mrs. Carmody, who's watching everything with a
brittle smile of intense satisfaction...

WE FADE TO BLACK AND BRING UP A TITLE:

THE FIRST NIGHT
INT. MARKET - NIGHT

We're hearing sounds in the night...things moving around in
the Mist in the dark...distant, raptor-like shrieks...the

flappings of strange wings...the deep grunts of huge unseen
beasts in a world now primordial...
M3.

People huddle in the dark (lit only by tea-candles) like our
ancestors in their caves, just trying to get through the
night...exhausted, dazed with disbelief, etched with despair...

Some are tossing in sleep. Some are awake, looking like they'll
never sleep again. Some are drunk and passed out; some are ,
drinking and trying to get there. Some are just hugging their
knees and staring at nothing, minds gone bye-bye.

The three soldiers are chainsmoking and sharing a bottle of
Jack Daniels. Jessup is shellshocked, numb.

ANGLE FINDS the only person who seems to be thriving in this
horror: Mrs. Carmody. She's on an altar-like sprawl of crates,
lit by votive candles, preaching in a low hypnotic monotone
to the FOUR PEOPLE who have joined her.

DAVID

is slumped, dozing. Irene and Hattie are asleep. Across from
him is Amanda, curled up with Billy on a furniture pad.

David comes fully awake. He realizes Amanda's watching him. A
long look passes between them. In whispers:

° AMANDA
This isn't going to end. Is it?

David says nothing. She reaches her hand across the floor,
touches his. There's a connection growing here...possibly an
uncomfortable one. David checks the time, whispers:

DAVID
My turn on watch. I won't be far.
Just up there. Okay?

She nods. David rises, drapes a flashlight with fabric to
keep the beam dim, heads off.

OLLIE

is watching over the injured as best he can, making do with
Slim over-the-counter resources. Joe has serious third-degree
burns, shivering and moaning under a furniture pad, half-
conscious. The lady who got trampled has her broken arm in a
makeshift sling. A few other people have cuts and bruises.

David drifts from the gioom, joins Ollie. Buddy Eagleton is
there too, keeping vigil over his burned brother.

DAVID
Joe? How you holding up, partner?

JOE
D--David? That you?
74.

DAVID
Yeah, pal. How you doing?

BUDDY
{anguished)
It's bad. He's bad.

JOB
Yeah. Jesus. Didn't know anything
could hurt like this...
(beat)
If you guys can't help me, you gotta
end it, okay? Ollie's got that gun,
right? Right?

BUDDY
No, uh-uh, no way.

JOE
You can't fuck around with me on
this, bro. Not with me like this.
(eyes on them, pleading)
I'll do it. Just gimme the gun...

DAVID
We're not there yet, okay?

JOE
---Please..-.please...

DAVID
Joe, now listen. We're gonna work
something out. Just hang on a little
more. Will you do that?
(to Buddy)
Stay with him. We'll be back.

Buddy nods. David motions for Ollie to follow him. They rise,
heading toward the front of the store, whispering:

OLLIE
We can't just do nothing while Joe
dies.

DAVID

I know. I've been thinking.
(off Ollie's look)
About that pharmacy next door.

David motions him toward the barricade.

AMANDA

carefully pulls away from Billy so as not to wake him, crawls
to Hattie, whispers:
13.

AMANDA
Hattie? I need to go to the bathroom.
Will you watch Billy?
{no response)
Hattie?

She touches Hattie's shoulder -- and freezes. Something's
very wrong. Filling with dread, Amanda reaches for a tea
candle, brings the light closer...

TIGHT ON HATTIE

++-.revealing Hattie's eyes staring...dead. As Amanda shifts
the light, CAMERA PANS to reveal a bottle of prescription
pills lying empty next to Hattie's hand.

FRONT OF THE STORE

David and Ollie find Dan Miller on watch. David waves Mike
Hatlen over. They crouch together, speaking in whispers:

DAVID
Anything?

DAN
The last of those bugs went away
around four. Dawn's coming soon.
(glances up)
What's on your mind?

David gestures to Ollie -- tell ‘em.

OLLIE
It's Joe. If we don't get him on
some serious antibiotics, he'll die
of infection. Plus he needs
painkillers in the worst way. Pain’s
So bad he's asking for the gun.
. (off their grim looks)
All we have here is aspirin and
liquor.

DAN
You're thinking about that pharmacy
next door...

OLLIE
They've got Silvadene, the stuff
they use in burn wards. Plus
bandages, penicillin, oxycontin...

MIKE
Whoa, slow down...
(to David)
You actually considering this?
Te.

DAVID
For a start. I've also been thinking
beyond that.
(off their looks)
I've been weighing this very
carefully. We have to get out of
here. I mean permanently.

MIKE
Why? We got plenty to eat.

DAVID
It's not about the supplies. What
happens when one of those things
decides to break through this window?
I'm talking one of the big ones, like
the one that killed Norm. What do we
do then, fight it off with mops?

DAN
I've been wondering the same thing.
This window's hanging by a thread.
Anyway, the flaming torch idea didn't
work out so well, did it? We almost
burned the goddamn store down.

They look up as a figure appears from the darkness -- Amanda,
looking pale and drawn. She whispers:

AMANDA
It's Hattie.

BACK OF STORE

Amanda brings them down the aisle. Billy's still asleep. Irene
is sitting with Hattie's body. She looks up, whispers:

IRENE
I'll watch Billy.

The men quietly gather up the corners of the furniture pad
Hattie's lying o:

IN THE LOADING DOCK

-+-and bring the body in. Amanda clicks on a flashlight. They

lay the body atop boxes next to the two other corpses already
there: Tom Smalley and Sally.

AMANDA
(shaken, near tears)
I don't know how long she was there
like that. Lying there next to us.
I thought she was sleeping.

David looks to the men, growing more determined than ever.
We

DAVID
I've got my four wheel drive out
there.

AMANDA
You're talking about leaving?

DAVID

We'll try for the pharmacy first,
bring back supplies for the injured.
If we don't, Joe Bagleton's gonna
die, and we can't let that happen.
After that...

(beat)
Look, I can fit eight people in my
Scout. I say we drive south as far
as the fuel takes us, hope we get
clear of this mist.

DAN
That's it? That's the plan?

DAVID
It's all I've got.

AMANDA
You can't mean it. Not after what
happened to Norton and his group.

DAVID
They went like lambs to slaughter.
Doesn't mean we have to. Amanda,
think. Norton got over two hundred
feet from this store. I'm parked
less than half that distance from
here. If that.

MIKE
But who knows how far this mist has

spread? Could be the entire eastern
seaboard!

DAVID
Hell, Mike, could be the entire world
for all we know. We'd be just as
dead either way, wouldn't we?

MIKE
We have one gun. And how Many rounds?

OLLIE
I fired two. That leaves ten.

MIKE
Ten rounds, Jesus...
78.

DAVID
Okay, so, ten. You want another
reason to get the hell out of here?
I'll give you the best one...her.
Mrs. Carmody. Our very own Jim Jones.
I'd like to leave before people
start drinking the Kool Aid, y'know?

OLLIE
He's right. The flakier people get,
the better she's gonna look.

MIKE :
No, guys, that's just crazy. It's
obvious she's nuts. Who's gonna :
listen to her? |

AMANDA i
You heard that woman out there after :
Sally died. That's one true believer.

DAVID

I count four. She's preaching to i
them right now. By noon she'll have i
four more. By tomorrow night, when :
those things come back, she'll have i

a congregation. Then we can start :
worrying about who she's gonna

sacrifice to make it all better. :
You, Mike? One of the women? My a
little boy? :

DAN
He’s right.

MIKE
You don't have much faith in
humanity, do you?

None whatsoever.

MIKE
(looks to David)
I can't accept that. I believe people
are basically good. Decent. My God,
David, we're a civilized society!

DAVID
Sure. As long as the machines are
working and you can dial 911. You
take those things away, toss people
in the dark, scare the shit out of
them, no more rules, you'll see how
primitive they get. Scare people
badly enough, you'll get 'em to do
anything.
iy.

DAN
That's right. They'll turn to
whatever promises a solution. Grasp
at any straw.

In quiet emphasis, he places Hattie's empty pill bottle on
her chest, covers her face with the furniture pad.

MIKE
Ollie, help me, back me up here.

OLLIE
With what? The Holocaust? Rwanda?
The Inquisition? 9-11? Read the
papers, Mike. As a species, we're
fundamentally insane. You get more
than two of us in a room together,
we start dreaming up reasons to
kill one another. Why do you think
we invented politics and religion?

MIKE
I'm not convinced.

DAVID
Nobody has to decide anything now.
First thing's first -- the pharmacy.
That'll be our test run, okay?

— WE FADE TO BLACK AND BRING UP A TITLE:
THE EXPEDITION TO THE PHARMACY
INT. MARKET - DAY
David facing his son, who's on the verge of tears:

BILLY
I don’t want you to.

DAVID
It's all right, Big Bill. I'11 bring
you back that Spiderman comic book.

BILLY
I don't want it. I want you to stay
here.

DAVID

Billy. We have to get out sooner or
later. You see that, don't you?

BILLY
When the fog goes away...

DAVID
It's been a whole day now.
80.

BILLY
Daddy...Daddy, there are things out
there. Things.

DAVID
There are a lot less of them in the
daytime.

BILLY

(draws close, whispering)
They'll wait. They'll wait in the
fog where you can't see ‘em. And
when you go out and can't get back
in, they'll come eat you up.

(fierce, panicky hug)
Daddy, don't go.

. DAVID
I'll be back, Billy. I promise.

The boy starts to cry, helplessly and deeply. David glances
up at Amanda, who takes Billy. David rises, as:

AMANDA
(quiet, intense)
If something happens...anything at
all...you cut and run. Get your ass
back in here. For your boy’s sake.

He slips something into her hand, whispers in her ear:

DAVID
Something happens to me, the Scout's
yours. Look after Billy the best
you can as long as you can.

She looks down, sees that he's given her his car keys. He
goes to the front of the store as ANGLE WIDENS TO FIND:

MRS. CARMODY
And where do you think you're going,
Mr. David Drayton? Are you so anxious
to make your boy an orphan?

People are gathering, watching, as:

DAVID

My boy is no concern of yours.

(to everybody)
Listen up. We're going over to the
pharmacy. We need to bring back
supplies to help our injured. Also
there may be people trapped over
there who need help.
81.

OLLIE
We're not taking any chances, folks.
At the first sign of trouble, we'll
pop back into the market--

MRS. CARMODY
And bring the fiends of hell down
on our heads, say thankya!

WOMAN
She's right! You'll make them notice
us! You'll make them come! Why can't
you just leave well enough alone?

DAN
Lady, this what you call well enough?

DAVID
You wanna stop us? Fine. But first
explain to Buddy here why we're not
getting painkillers and medicine
for his brother. .

BUDDY
Screw that, I'm going. Even if 1
have to go alone.

MRS. CARMODY

(to Buddy)
And you will die out there! You'll
step out that door and be torn apart!

. (to David)

Then your hellbound pride will get
us killed. They'll come for the rest
of us just as this good woman says!

(to the crowd)
You gonna let that happen? It's
this sort of hubris...this sort of
pride in defiance of God that brought
the Final Wrath upon us! It's death!
It’s deeaaaa--

And whack! A can of peas flies out of nowhere and smacks her
in the head. Her head sna

ips back, dazed and stunned. She looks
around, realizing it was:

AMANDA
Shut up, you miserable old buzzard.

MRS. CARMODY
Harlot! Whore!

(points)

She serves the Foul One! She serves
Satan!
|

82.

AMANDA
Bullshit. Stoning people who piss
you off is perfectly okay. Says so
in the Bible.

Amanda picks up another can of peas, hefts it.

AMANDA
And I got lots of peas.

Carmody looks around, sees people turning away, realizes the
spell she was weaving is broken. Softly:

MRS. CARMODY
There will be a reckoning, missy
bitch. You'll be the first chosen,
mark my word.

IRENE
We don't have all day to listen to
your horseshit. Let's go.

DAVID
(to the soldiers)

How about it, Army? Any help from
the armed forces here?

Bisby and Donaldson trade dark looks, drift away.

BISBY —
Fuck it. :
JESSUP
(hesitates)
I'll go.

‘They gather at the door, a group of nine with a makeshift
arsenal of knives, crowbars, sharpened mop handles. We have
David (ax), Ollie (gun), Irene (carry-basket full of Raid,
Plus her tennis racket), Jessup (somebody hands him a butcher
knife), Dan, Mike, Buddy Eagleton, Arnie Simms...and Jim
Grondin, looking way bleary and hungover.

JIM
What'cha gonna do with that there
tennis racket, Mrs. Reppler?

IRENE
Maybe whonk you upside the head,
for a start.
(peers at him)
Jim Grondin, isn't it? Didn't I
have you in school?

JIM
(umeasy smile)
Yes'm. Me and my sister Pauline.
83.

IRENE
Pair of underachievers. After you,
Jim.

She straight-arms the door open, staring, waiting for him to
step out. Looking shit-scared, he does. The others follow.

People are drawn to the windows, watching, as:

EXT. MARKET - DAY

Dan takes the lead, followed by David, Ollie, the others. It
truly is another world out here, silent, eerie as hell.

CAMERA DRIFTS in slow and ominous ways, tracking our group
through the Mist as they move single file, weapons poised.

The market is lost within yards, gone in the Mist. The only
thing they have to go by now is the walkway connecting the
market and pharmacy. A trashcan looms by, and then:

Dan Miller pauses up ahead. He's found the pharmacy door.

DAN
Oh, dear God, look at this.

Ollie and David move up, seeing:

An arm is stretched across the threshold, stiff and white,
dead hand poised as if clawing the pavement...

ANGLE FROM INSIDE PHARMACY
++-and we find a body sprawled there, minus its head.

The group gathers in the open doorway, the old wooden doors
propped wide. Jim looks ready to puke or run. He turns away,
but Irene prods him in the chest with her tennis racket .

/ IRENE
Steady.

DAN
Their a.c. was out. They had the
doors propped wide open.

CAMERA PULLS SLOWLY BACK, revealing the store, as, softly:

OLLIE

I seem to be running out of hope,
David.

The Pharmacy is a scene of carnage, but even more than that,
it's been transformed into something beyond weird: it's like

a white cave in here, walls and ceiling festooned with what
appears to be silk.

 
84.

BUDDY .
Whatever came in here, looks like
it's gone.

DAVID

Let's keep our eyes open anyway.

They enter, tense as hell, flashlights sweeping the misty .
air, illuminating the silky stuff...it’s everywhere, connecting
floors to ceiling, shrouding shelves and counters.

IRENE
What on earth happened here? What
the hell got in?

David pauses at a rack of comic books. He grabs a Spiderman,
a Hellboy, a Goon, jams them in his back pocket.

DAVID
Where do they keep the meds?

OLLIE
Back there, I think. I can barely
see for all this stuff.

The silk is getting thicker the further in they go. They get
to the pharmacist's divided area, find the door open.

DAVID
Ollie, you and me.

INSIDE PHARMACIST'S CUBICLE

They dart inside, Ollie scanning the shadows with his gun,
David playing the flashlight beam around. Ollie finds what
they're looking for, starts grabbing things off the shelves
and jamming them fast into a grocery bag...

OLLIE
Silvadene, perfect. Penicillin. See
any Vicodin? Oxycontin?

OUTSIDE THE CUBICLE

The others are tense, waiting. PUSH IN ON Dan, listening,
starting to hear scuttling sounds.

DAN
Guys. Hurry. I'm hearing something.

what? DAVID (0.S.)

Jim steps TIGHT INTO FRAME, looking up, also listening.

JIM
Something fuckin weird.
BO.

Jessup sweeps his flashlight around, suddenly seeing something
in the glare of his beam...

JESSUP
Oh, fuck...

;:-it's a dead human being tangled in the silk, embedded in
it, arms and legs outstretched at extreme angles 1 mouth wide
in a silent scream. David and Ollie exit the cubicle, as:

JIM
{starts to weep) _
Oh, God, no...no, no, no...

Their flashlights beams start finding other bodies in the

silk, bodies all around us, strung like macabre Halloween
splays, faces frozen and desiccated in death, hands contorted

into claws...

DAVID
(breathless whisper)
This silk...it's...oh, Christ, I
think it's webs...we have to leave...

Jim is wide-eyed with horror, backing toward the door, when:
A_FIGURE embedded in the silk behind him suddenl reaches out
and grabs him with a horrible GROAN. dim turns and SCREAMS.

It's the M.P. we saw earlier in the market, his face a ghastly
parchment white, barely able to speak:

M.P.
--80rry...I'm sorry...all our
fault...help me...please help me...

David and Ollie push Jim aside, try to pull the M.P. free.
The M.P. suddenly starts convulsing, and they realize:

There are things crawling under his skin -- writhing, moving
lumps. The M.P. claws at his shirt, convulsing ever harder,
ripping buttons open, exposing skin...

His entire torso is movin » heaving, swelling with countless
moving lumps. Our group backs off in horror, as:

DAVID

hears a noise from above (like a faint bullwhip crack) and
looks up as a streamer of white silk flies at his face. He
jerks aside, it misses him by inches.

The sounds start erupting all around them, streamers of ‘silk
shooting out from all directions, as HUGE, SPIDER-LIKE SHAPES
the size of dogs scuttle into view all around them, riding
the contours of silk, surrounding them, cutting them off,
making horrific MEWLING sounds...
86.

DAVID
THE DOOR! GO!

But a streamer suddenly snares Buddy Eagleton's thigh, twining
and slicing corrosively through his jeans. Blood bursts out
as his jeans leg falls away and Buddy goes sprawling...

BUDDY -
OH JESUS THAT HURTS!

David and Jessup grab him, pull him clumsily to his feet, as
huge SPIDER-SHAPES in the silk block their path to the exit.

A SPIDER-THING

looms into the light, revealed: twelve oddly jointed legs,
body glistening and hairy...but most nightmarish of all, its
face is vaguely suggestive of a human's, and it's grinning.

Ollie raises the pistol, SHOOTS it between the eyes. The thing
cartwheels back into the silk, spewing black ichor-like blood.

Another drops from the silk. David buries his ax in it.

Behind them, the M.P. SHRIEKS like a soul in hell, jerking in

his silk cocoon prison, his body now undulating with whatever's
under his skin, swelling like a balloon about to burst...
The M.P.'s convulsing so hard he rips free of the silk, falling

forward, and as he impacts the floor, he splits open like a
vipe chrysalis, and:

“A Elood of SPIDER-BABIES comes pouring from his body across
the floor, streaming and scuttling, hundreds of them, mewling

Tike kittens, faces grinning and insane...

David and the others make for the door as best they can, David
and Ollie dragging Buddy between them, his lips already blue
from blood loss, already going into shock...

Crack, crack -- streamers shooting out of the web maze. one
wraps around Mike Hatlen's arm, sinking into his flesh. He
SCREAMS. Arnie grabs him, tries to pull him free, but:

A streamer comes whip-thwack around Mike's neck. His eyes go
wide as his jugular erupts and he goes down with a strangled
sound, thrashing weakly as he gets pulled away into the

webbing. The newborn SPIDER-BABIES come swarming, lapping up
his blood like kittens, covering him in an undulating wave...

Arnie SCREAMS, turns to run, but:

An adult SPIDER-THING pops from the silk and rears onto its

back set of legs, nailing him right in the face with silk-goo
shot from an orifice in its belly.
Irene runs up, spraying the thing with Raid. The creature
lets out a MEWLING SHRIEK from the depths of hell, falls back
in_a scurrying/thrashing heap, and vanishes into the web maze
pulling Arnie with it. Again, spider-babies come running,
trailing the human prize into the silken darkness...

Our group keeps making for the.door, bashing webbing aside,
spider-babies swarming at their ankles, Irene screaming and
spraying Raid, scattering them back, David and Ollie and Jessup
@ragging Buddy, Jim Grondin just screaming over and over again
like he may never stop...

A SPIDER-THING drops before them, twisting and grinning on
its silk, and BLAM, gets a bullet from Ollie for its trouble,
and then they're out the door with Dan leading the way...

OUTSIDE

-.,and they're dragging Buddy, shapes all around them, spider-
things in the Mist. A huge one pops out of the trashcan they
passed earlier, scurries over the side and onto the pavement,
barring their path. Ollie levels the gun, pulls the trigger
with a dry-empty snap, out of bullets, and Dan shoves him
aside, screaming, and impales the goddam thing with his
prybar, driving it back in a squealing explosion of black
blood and flailing legs, and David and Ollie are dragging
Buddy Eagleton between them, but:

OLLIE
David! David, he’s dead! Let him
go! They got his artery!

And they drop Buddy right there on the pavement, running for
their lives, and as they get to the door of the market they
look back and the last thing they see is Buddy's corpse getting
swarmed by spider-things, spinning their webs and grinning
their grins and mewling like cats...

INT. MARKET - DAY

-;:and then the survivors are back inside, reeling in the
aftermath of lunacy and nightmare, everybody in the market
just staring as Billy comes running, hurls himself sobbing
into his father's arms, and Jim just screams and screams and
screams, his mind totally gone...

MRS. CARMODY
(Laughing)
So? How'd it go?

-..and Jim's screams just keep echoing as WE FADE TO BLACK
AND BRING UP A TITLE:

MRS. CARMODY AND THE SOLDIERS

EEE eS

 
INT. MARKET - DAY

TIGHT ON DAVID'S FACE, asleep, curled into a fetal bail,
tortured by dreams. His eyes come open, hearing:

MRS. CARMODY (0.S.)
---expiation. It's expiation we
wanna think about now. We have been
scourged with whips and scorpions.
We have seen the lips of the earth
vomit forth obscenities of nightmare.
The rock will not hide them, the
dead trees give no shelter. And how
will it end? What will stop it?

VOICES (0.8.)
(muttering)
-.-expiation...expiation...

David sits up, bleary, trying to focus his thoughts.

Amanda sits across from him, watching him, her arms wrapped
protectively around Billy. Billy looks exhausted and scared.

BILLY
Daddy? You okay?

DAVID
(nods)
How long have I been out?

AMANDA .
Most of the day. You just came over
here, laid down, and went to sleep.

DAVID
Passed out, more like it. Just shut
down for a while. I'm sorry.

AMANDA
You needed it.

(pause)
It. was bad...wasn't it?.

DAVID
Yeah. Bad.

Ollie appears, trailed by Irene and Ambrose Cornell.

DAVID
How's Joe?

OLLIE
He died of his burns while you were
asleep. We were too late.

David absorbs this, glances up at Mrs. Carmody's voice.

 
wy.

DAVID
I thought I was dreaming her voice.

AMANDA
No dream. It's like some kind of
crazy church service over there.
She's getting people whipped up.

DAVID
How many?

IRENE
Over a dozen. But more than that
are listening.

AMANDA
They're giving her credit for knowing
Buddy would die out there. And Sally
before that. Even Norton's group,
when they went out. She's got tem
thinking she's psychic, like she's
got some kinda direct line to God.

AMBROSE
Why wouldn't they? Woman never shuts
up. Like those speeches Castro used
to make. It's a goddamn filibuster.

DAVID
Jesus.

AMBROSE
Jesus got nothin' to do with it, son.
She's been talking human sacrifice.

OLLIE
Yeah. Seems to be her growth stock.

David struggles to his feet, still a bit woozy.

IRENE
Ollie told us you're thinking of
leaving. I'm in.

DAVID
No. Sorry. I can't walk out that
door again. Ever.
(off their looks)
You saw what happened to Buddy.
Mike. Arnie. I won't do that again.
I won't be responsible. I won't.

OLLIE
You may have to reconsider.
yu.

They exit the aisle, find Myron LaFleur and Dan Miller watching
Mrs. Carmody from a distance. David looks down toward the
produce section, where:

The crazy woman is leading her "service," working it like an
old-time fire-and-brimstone tent revival. People are crowded
around, others scattered about, as:

MRS. CARMODY
Expiation! Let me hear you say it
like you mean it!

VARIOUS PEOPLE
-.-expiation...expiation...

JIM
(shouting the loudest)
EXPIATION! EXPIATION!

DAN
Welcome to Sesame Street. Today's
word is "expiation."

DAVID
Is that...Jim?

DAN
That boy has not been right since
the pharmacy. His mind's just
snapped. Gone.

MYRON
(watching his friend)
I just cannot fuckin believe this...

JIM
is staring with bright, fevered eyes, as:

MRS. CARMODY
Expiation, that's right! It's
expiation gonna clear off these
monsters and abominations! Expiation
gonna drop the scales from our eyes
and let us see! And what does the
Bible say expiation is? What is the
only cleanser for sin in the Eye
and Mind of God?

JIM
BLOOD!

TIGHT ON DAVID

Watching. Horror seeping into his bones. He notices:
gh.
DAVID'S POV

Mr. Mackey, the butcher, is one of Carmody's group. He has
his back to us. A gleaming butcher's knife, crusted with dried
blood, is tucked in the back of his apron strings. Suddenly:

Mackey turns...looks over his shoulder at David, meeting his
gaze. Mackey’s eyes are vacant. He looks back to Mrs. Carmody.

MRS. CARMODY
Blood! It's blood that is demanded!
Blood that will wash away our
corruption and sin! Blood!

FAVORING DAVID

MYRON
Well, this is just so much bullshit.
We gotta put a stop to it just about
any way we can. ‘

DAN
Myron, wait, no--

But Myron goes over to Jim, grabs him by the shoulder to try
to talk sense to him. Suddenly, we can hear Jim yelling...

JIM
No, you shut up! You! It’s still a
free goddamn country, so shut up if
you know what's good for ya!

---and WHAM, Jim punches Myron in the mouth, lays him out on

the floor, starts kicking him. Myron scurries away, clutching
his bleeding mouth, as:

MRS. CARMODY
Another unbeliever! But he'll
believe, yes, he'll believe before
it's through...

DAVID'S GROUP

DAVID
(softly)
It hasn't even been two days. Not
even two days.

DAN
So much for the goodness of mankind.
Awful thing to say, but I'm glad
Mike's not alive to see it.
OLLIE

What do you say we get out of this
loony bin, David?
David turns.
doesn't want

DLs

AMBROSE
I intend to leave or die trying.
I'm not spending the rest of my
life in here, tell you what.

They're all looking to him. It's obvious he
that responsibility.

OLLIE
I can quietly gather some bags of
groceries together, hide them up at
the checkstands by the door.

DAN
It was your idea. It's your vehicle.
It'll be on your say-so.

David meets Amanda's eyes.

AMANDA
_T think you were right before. And

even if you're wrong, you know what?
I'd rather die out there trying
than in here waiting.

{beat )
I would do anything...take any

chance...just to see the sun again,

DAVID
I want to know what this mist is.
Maybe it'll help us figure out what
we're up against.
(off their looks)
I want to talk to the soldiers.

OLLIE
The soldiers? Why, what's that gonna
do?

DAVID
Don't you remember what the M.P.
said in the pharmacy?

OLLIE
David, I'm not even sure I knew he

was talking. The situation was a
littie insane.

TRENE
(realizing)
He said he was.. -sSorry. That's the
word he used, wasn't it? *Sorry."

DAN

That's right. He said it was their
fault, didn't he?
ys.

AMANDA
What did he mean by that?

DAVID
That's what we're going to find
out. Have you seen them?

AMBROSE
Not since we got back from the
pharmacy. Them Army boys were looking
like scared rabbits.

DAVID
Irene, look after Billy, please.

Irene nods. The others join David, looking for the soldiers.
VARIOUS ANGLES

David and the others split up, walking the aisles, searching !
for any sign of the soldiers. They're nowhere to be seen. We i
hear Mrs. Carmody preaching throughout, the only sound in the

store, an unnerving and relentless backdrop:

MRS. CARMODY }
"...and the seventh angel poured
out his vial into the air, and there
came a great voice out of the temple
of heaven, from the throne, saying:
It is done...°

CAMERA FOLLOWS David alone now, searching, seeing people

scattered about the store, getting his share of hostile and
paranoid looks. Still no sign of any soldiers.

MRS. CARMODY
"...and there were voices, lightnings
and thunders, and a great earthquake
such as was not seen since men were
upon the earth, so mighty an
earthquake, and so great..."

MURMURS from the crowd, a woman calling out: \

WOMAN (0.S.)
I felt that earthquake! I felt it!

David moves along the checkstands, notices:

Cigarette smoke rising from one of the checkouts. David moves
toward it, finds Jessup on the floor there. He's smoking,
jumpy as hell, hoping nobody notices him. He sees David.

JESSUP
What?
pa.

Ollie and Dan have noticed, start drifting over. Jessup sees
them coming. David crouches down.

big a store.

DAVID
Where are your friends?

JESSUP :
Dunno. Ain't seen 'em. :

DAVID i
How could you lose ‘em? Not that :

Jessup tries to leave, but Ollie arrives and blocks his escape |
Path. Jessup shrinks back like a cornered cat.

. JESSUP

I ain't seen 'em, I said. I look
like their keeper? What the fuck
you want from me?

DAVID
What do you know about this mist?

 

JESSUP
I don't know nothin’! Nothin'! 1
got nothin' to do with it!

DAVID
—_— That's not what the M.P. said. In
the pharmacy. Before the spiders
came out of his skin.

 

JESSUP
I don't give a fuck. Leave me alone,
I said, you deaf?

Now Dan arrives, making Jessup even more skittish.

DAN :
They're not in the store. Not even
the restrooms. Only place we haven't
checked is the loading dock.

DAVID
(looks to Jessup)
That where they are? Loading dock?

JESSUP
I don't know. Maybe. Go see if you're
curious, just fuck off already.

; DAVID
I'd like you to come with us.

! JESSUP
' Screw you.
95.

DAVID
(pause, quietly)

I_ know you're a hometown boy, but
that cuts you zero slack. Ollie
there has a gun. If you don't come
quietly, I'm going to ask him to
shoot you in the leg. He'll do it,
teo. And then we're gonna drag you.

Another pause. Jessup checking their faces. He crushes out
his cigarette, hands quavering...

MOVING CAMERA

+..and they come down the aisle toward the loading dock,
drawing as little attention as they can, while:

MRS. CARMODY (0.S.)}
"...and they gnawed their tongues
for pain and blasphemed the God of
heaven and repented not of their
deeds..."

FAVORING JIM

listening to Carmody preach. He glances over, sees David's
group move into the loading dock, his curiosity rousing...

IN THE LOADING DOCK

David's group enters, spreading into the darkness, clicking
on flashlights. Eerie as hell in here, especially with the
earlier casualties laid out atop the boxes like some bizarre
funeral bier. Joe's burned corpse has joined the others.

David looks to Jessup, gives him a nod.

JESSUP
Bisby? Donaldson?

No reply...just choking darkness. Flashlight beams crawl,
making the shadows move in sinister ways.

DAN
Dammit, this is the only place they
can be.

JESSUP
Look, I told you, okay? I don't
know where they are, and I don't--

AMBROSE
JESUS!

Flashlights sweep upward. Amanda stifles a shriek. Two
uniformed figures hang in the shadows above them, feet
dangling, ghastly faces staring down, necks stretched at

 
96.

horrific angles, clothesline connecting their necks to the
ceiling pipes above. Bisby and Donaldson.

David's flashlight travels down, the beam finding the chairs
they placed atop the stacks of boxes and kicked away to hang
themselves. Jessup gasps, breaks down in tears:

JESSUP
I didn't think they'd do it. They
said, but I didn't think they would.
Oh Jesus...

DAVID
It's the Arrowhead Project, isn't
it? This mist, it’s some kind of
military fuckup. What were you guys
messing with up there? Huh?

Jessup turns, runs for the door, bumps right into:

Jim. He's followed them in. Jessup screams in fright. Jim
grabs him, pulls him forward, CAMERA FOLLOWING as he hurls
him right through the swinging doors into: .

THE MARKET
Jessup sprawls headlong, as:

JIM
IT'S THEM WHAT DONE IT TO US! THEM
WHAT BRUNG DOWN THE FINAL WRATH!

Jessup glances up, sees people coming from all around. David
and his group rush from the loading dock as people converge
from all points of the compass, but the scariest one is:

MRS. CARMODY
(striding this way)
What's this? What's this?

JESSUP
It ain't my fault!

JIM
I heard him! Those two peckerwoods
he was with went and hung '‘emselves!
They knew, they knew all along!

JESSUP
He's crazy! He doesn't know what
he's talking about!

JIM
They heard it too, yes they did!
That Arrowhead Project up the
mountain! That secret shit they
were doing up there brung it on us!
vie

MRS. CARMODY
(approaches, checks
uniform name tag)
Private...Jessup?

JESSUP
{on his knees, pleading)
It wasn’t me! I'm just stationed up
there! I'm not responsible! Hell,
I'm a local, most'a you know me, I
just joined up for my college--

She bends down, right in his face, nose to nose, screaming:

MRS. CARMODY
STOP YOUR CHICKENSHIT WHINING! TELL ME
OR I'LL CUT YOUR PULING TONGUE OUT!

JESSUP
I'm just a grunt...they don't tell
me nothing...but I heard stuff.
Hell, we all heard stuff...

MRS. CARMODY
Stuff. :

JESSUP
_ ++.like how they thought there were
other dimensions...like all around
us...and how they wanted to try and
open a...a window, like...you know,
so they could look through and see
what's on the other side...

MRS. CARMODY
Maybe your window turned out to be
a door, didn't it?

JESSUP

Not mine! Those scientists! They
must'a ripped a hole open by accident,
and this other dimension come spilling
through...that's what Donaldson was
saying before he hung himself! I
didn't understand half of it...

{off her look)
IT AIN'T MY FAULT!

He glances around, sees a lot of bloodthirsty, vengeful faces
staring at him. Mrs. Carmody turns, slow, scanning her flock.

MRS. CARMODY
Ain't. His. Fault. No, ain't nothin’

ever anybody's fault. He denies.
Points the finger. This Judas in
our midst .
98.

David takes a step forward, wanting to defuse the situation,
but Ollie grabs his arm, gives him a firm look of "no."

MRS. CARMODY
You've seen it now! The truth of
what I say! It’s this sort of hubris!
This sort of willful priiiide against
God! This defiance of His will!

CAMERA CHURNS IN QUEASY 360s around her.. -She's turning,
savoring the moment, looking them all in the eye...

MRS. CARMODY

We been punished for delving into
secrets forbidden by God of old!
Walkin' on the moooon! Splittin’
His atoms! Messin’ with His stem
cells for the secrets of life that
only God above has any right to!
Gettin’ too big for our britches,
is what! And now His ju nt is
come upon us! The Fiend is let loose!
Star Wormwood blazes!

(turns, points at Jessup)
AND THEY DONE IT! THEY BROUCHT THE
DARKNESS DOWN BY SPITTIN' IN THE
ALMIGHTY'S BYE!

: JESSUP

NO!

Jessup lunges to his feet, tries to run. gim Grondin shoves
him hard, rebounding him into the others...

HANDHELD CAMERA

---and Jessup screams, trying to break through, but the crowd
pummels him, drives him back, bouncing him around in its big,
ragged circle. David tries to jump in to help him, but gim
sees him coming and whirls around, driving a fist hard into
David's face, laying him out flat, while:

Jessup is being hit, spun around, trying to escape, and:

Sbhhkkk -- he runs right into the tip of Mr. Mackey's butcher
knife. Mackey the neighborhood butcher, now just a mindless

acolyte. Jessup stands frozen, mouth gaping. Mackey pulls the
knife out, stabs him again...

Jessup staggers back, clutching his stomach, turns and runs,
but the mob is on him from all sides, pressing in, flailing,
punching, pummeling, hollering with bloodlust...

JIM
EXPIATION! EXPIATION!
uy.

+..and the soldier is pleading for his life even as he gets

brutalized by little old ladies and the guy who works at the
gas station, by people who have been friends and neighbors,

by people now turned savage killers, and we hear:

MRS. CARMODY
GIVE HIM TO THE BEASTS! LET THE
BEASTS TAKE HIM!

They lift him howling into the air, countless hands hoisting
him aloft, his arms and legs spread wide in a sacrificial i

. Stance, a crucifixion pose, and the mindless bellowing mob :
races up the aisle, knocking things from their shelves, leaving r
a trail of smashed jars behind, stampeding toward: :

THE FRONT OF STORE

The door is. thrown open. The mob hurls the screaming soldier
out of the store into the parking lot. He lands in a sprawl :
out there, clutching his bleeding stomach. They get the door }
closed, barring it, throwing the lock bolts. i

Jessup staggers to his feet, dazed and reeling, seeing where :
he is. He turns to them, beseeching, face white with shock as i
the mob gathers to the windows to watch.

He staggers to the window, screaming, begging to be let back

in, pounding weakly on the glass. Dozens of faces stare back
at him with bright, insane anticipation.

DAVID'S GROUP re

David is trying to run to help, but the others grab him,
restraining him, Ollie literally driving him to the floor and
pinning him there, muttering desperately in his ear:

OLLIE

No, David, no...we need you.. -Billy
needs you, goddamn it...

FRONT OF STORE

Jessup at the glass, pounding, pleading to be let in...

And something looms from the Mist behind him, something big

and half-glimpsed, a huge hunched shape out of a Lovecraftian
fever dream, glistening and massive and angular. Jessup turns,
all the breath leaving his body, gazing up in awe and terror.

He turns to the people lining the windows, hands trembling on
the glass, and we can't hear him, but we can read his lips:

JESSUP
---please...
Lou.
And then the thing out there takes him, just snatches him

away in a whirl of roiling appendages, a spray of blood hitting
the glass as he gets yanked off in the blink of an eye.

Nothing out there now but Mist. Nothing inside but people
staring in silence.

DAVID'S GROUP

Stunned, devastated, shaking. Amanda is weeping.
MRS. CARMODY

turns away from the window, gleaming with satisfaction, looking
more alive than she's ever been.

MRS. CARMODY
“The beasts will leave us alone
tonight. Tomorrow...well, we'll

just have to wait and see, won't
we?

WE FADE TO BLACK AND BRING UP OUR FINAL TITLE:
ESCAPE
INT. MARKET - DAWN

Deep silence. Thick gloom. The world outside is brightening.

We find David sitting near the back of the store in a half
doze, his chin on his chest. His friends are all around him,
sprawled on furniture pads...some sleeping, some not.

David rouses, glances to Ollie. Ollie looks at his watch,
whispers one word:

OLLIE
Dawn.

David nods. The others start moving, sitting up. David
carefully wakes Billy, whispers in his ear:

DAVID
Are you ready to leave the bad lady?

The little boy nods, very serious and solem.

David looks around at the other faces peering at him from the
gloom: Dan, Irene, Ambrose. Myron, his face bruised, has also
joined them. So has Bud Brown, the store manager. Slow nods

all around. It’s a consensus -- they're all ready to leave
the bad lady. In whispers:
101.

OLLIE
Groceries are hidden at the first
checkout stand. Five bags. We can
grab them and be out the door.

DAVID
Scout's unlocked. Whoever gets there
first, open the front and back doors.
Everybody pile in fast as you can.

They rise, moving slowly and carefully up the aisle. David
gets to the head of the aisle, pauses and peers out to make
sure the coast is clear. He waves them out

FRONT OF THE STORE

They move fast, coming around the checkout stand to grab the
groceries...

. Which aren't there. There's just empty floor. They suddenly
hear a paper grocery bag crinkling. They stiffen, look up.

And there’s Mrs. Carmody looming from the shadows, a grocery
bag under her arm. She pulls out an apple.

MRS. CARMODY
Stealin’' food now.

She takes a big crunchy bite. David and his friends look
around, seeing:

FIGURES are stepping from the gloom, hemming them from all
sides, dozens of people with vacant gazes, blocking the path
to the doors. Many have weapons: knives, claw hammers...

DAVID
Going out now, Mrs. Carmody. Stand
away, please.

MRS. CARMODY
You can't go out. I won't allow it.

DAN
Won't...ablow it?

MRS. CARMODY
It's against God's will. Don't you
know that by now? What’s the matter
with you? Don't you believe in God?

DAVID
No one has interfered with you. All
we want is the same privilege.

MRS. CARMODY
Privilege.
102.

She tosses the apple, almost playfully. It smacks Amanda's
head, bouncing off across the floor. She pulls a bottle of
milk, flips off the lid, takes a long swig, eyes on David all
the while. She sets the bottle gently down on the counter...

MRS. CARMODY
Privilege.

-.,then she snaps like a child throwing a tantrum, smashing
the grocery bag every which way, flinging it around, bashing
it against the counter, spewing its contents, shrieking:

MRS. CARMODY
PRIVILEGE? PRIVILEGE? HELLBOUND
PRRRRIITIIIDE!

She tosses the mutilated, empty bag. Shattered jars and spilled
cans are everywhere. A ruptured soda can goes fizzing and
rolling quietly across the floor past David's feet. Mrs.
Carmody picks up her milk, catching her breath, takes another
swig. Vengeance is thirsty work.

MRS. CARMODY
You all heard what he said! These
are the sort of people who brought
it on! People who will not bend to
the will of the Almighty! Sinners
in pride, haughty they are, and
stiff-necked! They mock us, they
mock our God, our faith, our values
and our way of life, they mock our
humility and piousness! They piss
on us and laugh!

CAMERA PUSHES IN ON HER as she points, a mad Inquisitor. Mackey
the butcher and Jim Grondin appear at her side, both
brandishing knives, both ready to kill...

MRS. CARMODY
It is from their number the sacrifice
must come! From their number the
blood of expiation!

David grabs up the nearest thing he can find, a mop handle,
not much of a weapon, but he wields it...

DAVID
You try it. You fucking try.

MRS. CARMODY
It's the boy we want! Grab him!
Take him! Show them the price of
defiance! It's the boy we want!

+-;and the mob is closing in. David swings the mop handle,
whipping it through the air, trying to drive them back, keeping

them at bay only for the briefest of moments. Amanda's got
Billy, the boy clinging to her neck, terrified:

AMANDA
David--what do I--

Mackey and Jim come rushing forward, knives gleaming, as:

MRS. CARMODY
(screaming)
And the whore, too! Grab them both!
Get the boy, get the whore, kill
fem both, kill ‘em ali--

BLAM! A single gunshot, loud as hell.

The milk bottle in mrs. Carmody's hand EXPLODES, ruptures
outward, spews glass and milk in all directions.

Everything goes still. Mackey and Jim Ereeze a few paces away
like kids caught in a game of "red-light-green-light."

MRS. CARMODY

stands frozen, mouth agape - She drops what's left of the milk
bottle, takes a falter: ng step back, looks down at the ragged,
bloody hole in her stomach. She looks up, trying to speak.

DAVID
is staring at her in shock, turns and sees:

OLLIE

in a shooter's stance, Amanda's gun held in a two-handed grip,
smoke drifting from the barrel.

MRS. CARMODY

Her mouth opens and closes, opens again. She finally Manages
a croaking whisper:

MRS. CARMODY
---kill them...kill them all...

 

BLAM! Ollie SHOOTS HER AGAIN, in the head. Her head snaps

back, trailing blood through the air as she's spun around...she
clutches one of the registers to stop from falling...but the
register tips and goes down with her as she hits the floor.

One last violent spasm, and that's it.. -dead as hell.

People are backing away, stunned. Ollie jerks the gun at Jim,
ready to kill him, but Jim drops his knife and retreats. Mackey
also backs away. A WOMAN screams, starts sobbing:

A WOMAN
You kille@ her! You murdered her!
aus.

Ollie's in quiet turmoil, just as stunned as everybody else.
David goes to him, gently touches his arm.

DAVID
Thank you, Ollie. Let's go.

OLLIE
(wrestling with it)
I...I killed her.

DAVID
That's. why I said thank you. Come
on now. We have to leave.

David moves the group to the front door. He throws the lock
bolts open, picks Billy up, pauses as:

: OLLIE

I wouldn't have shot her, David.
Not if there had been any other
way. Do you believe me?

DAVID
Yes. I do.

OLLIE
Okay. Okay then. Let's go.

They throw the door open...
EXT. MARKET - DAY

:--and we're plunged into it, things happening fast, HANDHELD
in the Mist:

Ollie's running in front, pistol poised, the others spread
out behind him, footsteps clattering and echoing hollowly
across pavement, David holding Billy tight to his chest...

Ollie gets to the car first, throws open the front and rear
doors on the driver's side, turns, yelling for them to come,
and suddenly a HUGE SHAPE materializes in the Mist behina -

Ollie as David screams a warning --

DAVID
OLLIB!

~~ but the creature reaches down even as Ollie's turning,
plucks Ollie off his feet, jerks him screaming into the air,
giant claws scissoring and ripping Ollie open in a terrible
glut of blood that drenches the front of the car, Ollie'’s gun
falling onto the hood unfired, and then the shape is gone,
taking Ollie, vanishing in the Mist. .

David screams in anguish, keeps coming, throws Billy into the
front seat, turns back as he hears Amanda SCREAM. .
ius.

A shrieking SPIDER-THING has leapt from the hood of a car,

slams Myron screaming and flailing to the ground as it busily
cocoons him. Amanda is frozen, screaming...

Behind her, Bud Brown backs up in terror, turns and runs back
into his store...

Irene steps up, slaps Amanda to get her attention, then Irene
and Dan are running, pulling Amanda toward the car...

Ambrose is at their heels, trying to keep up, panting and
whining in terror, when another thing reaches out and plucks
him away in a whirl of whipping appendages...

Dan, Irene, and Amanda get to the car, David shoving Amanda
into the front seat and diving in after her, Irene and Dan
throwing themselves in back, slamming doors, and:

They're in. They're safe.

The four adults sit in total shock. Billy's clinging to David,
sobbing. A stretch of silence, and then:

IRENE
Are we going?

David's thoughts finally focus. He hands Billy off to Amanda.
The boy whimpers, clinging to her. David puts the key in the

ignition, sees the windshield and hood covered with Ollie's
blood. Also:

The gun is out there, lying on the hood.

AMANDA
David, no.

But he does it anyway, throws his door open, lunges half out
of the car, fingers clawing the hood, straining to grab the
gun. We hear SCUTTLING LEGS coming, horrific MEWLING SOUNDS...

He gets the gun, pulls his arm back in just as:

A SPIDER-THING leaps and lands on the hood, denting it, missing
David by inches, cracking the windshield. A second spider-
thing dashes in from the side, SLAMMING hard against the door
just as David slams it shut, rocking the Scout on its wheels.

The creature on the hood pauses, staring through the windshield
at them with its semi-human, grinning face...then scuttles up
the windshield, across the roof, and leaps off into the Mist

in search of easier prey. The second one also scuttles off.

David lets out a long breath, steadies himself, starts the
engine. He hits the washers. The wipers work Ollie's blood
away. David puts it in gear, pulls slowly out...
ANGLE AT PAVEMENT LEVEL

Ollie's glasses are big in frame f£.g., one bloody lens cracked
down the center, as the Scout pulls away...

ANGLE ON MARKET

The Scout looms from the Mist, coming around into the traffic
aisle in a glare of foglights. As the vehicle turns, the lights
splash across the plate glass window. We see dozens of faces
at the glass, pale and silent, staring...

ANGLE FROM INSIDE MARKET

People are silhouetted at the glass, the Scout's foglights
sending beams of light crawling through their midst...

OUTSIDE THE MARKET

.-.and then the staring faces are gone...and so is the Scout,
taillights disappearing into the Mist, as we

DISSOLVE TO:
INT/EXT. SCOUT - DAY

The vehicle materializes, coming through the Mist, turning
down David's long driveway. He slows, as:

David's house takes form before them. It looks still, vacant,
like a haunted house, windows staring like empty eye sockets.
Worse still, it's festooned with spider-webs.

David leans on the horn, BLARING IT. A long silence.

DAVID
Our front window was broken open.
The tree...my grandfather's tree...

He looks around, sees:

A familiar floppy sun hat is caught in a tangle of webbing at
the side of the house, swaying slightly in the breeze. His
wife's hat, the one she was wearing the last time we saw her.

WE PAN from the hat to a pale dead foot dangling from a cocoon
embedded in the branches of the downed tree.

It hits David hard. He knew it all along, but had to know for
sure. Now he does. He glances to Billy. The boy is in Amanda's
lap, mercifully asleep. Amanda has no words of comfort to
offer. From the back seat:

IRENE
I'm sorry, David. Truly sorry.
107.

David nods, puts it in gear. He turns the Scout around and
heads back up the driveway... :

DISSOLVE TO:
INT/EXT. SCOUT - DAY

-».and a DISSOLVING MONTAGE takes us methodically through a
blasted, Mist-shrouded world...

.-traveling south, ever south...

-:.crossing bridges choked with cars, maneuvering around
vehicles that stand mte and silent where people pulled over
when the Mist came, many with doors open, no people in sight...

-..the Scout easing gingerly over broken sections of pavement,
past slabs of tarmac standing up like tombstones, the result
of some great upheaval...

++.traveling through an eerie, mist-shrouded world in which
unseen creatures of nightmare shriek and howl, where winged
shapes go flapping by overhead on leathern wings...

-..trying the radio, Amanda scanning the band, getting nothing
but soft static...

-,-passing a sign in the Mist that reads "PORTLAND -- Next
Five Exits"...

--Slowing down to traverse another badly broken section of
pavement...and as the Scout moves on, CAMERA CRANES UP to
show the pavement they just crossed below us, the broken tarmac
in the shape of a giant, primordial FOOTPRINT...

DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. SCOUT - DAY
Foglights appear, coming slowly toward us in the Mist. As it

pulls closer, the ENGINE SPUTTERS, coughing on fumes...and
quits. The vehicle jerks, shudders, glides to a stop.

We hold for a long beat, PUSHING SLOWLY IN as we DISSOLVE:
INSIDE THE SCOUT

The gas gauge is on empty.

Billy's asleep. The four adults sit, exhausted. Out of gas
and out of hope. Knowing what this means. Like Mrs. Carmody
said: it's death. Nobody says anything for a while, then:

IRENE

We gave it good try. Nobody can say
we didn't.
108.

DAVID
No.

A heavy weight of silence. David works up his courage. Picks
up the gun. Cracks the cylinder. Shakes the bullets out. Two
rounds are expended. He discards the empty casings, leaving

four live rounds. He stares down at them in his palm. Softly:

DAVID
There's four left.

He looks up at the others. Everybody knows what this means.

DAN
There's five of us.

DAVID
I'll figure something out.

He loads the shells, softly closes the cylinder. He looks up
at them again. The moment is charged, awful. Amanda nods,
shaking, trying not to cry. Irene and Dan nod too.

ANGLE FROM OUTSIDE THE SCOUT

The vehicle sits silent and disembodied in the world of the
Mist. We hear Billy stirring, his soft voice:

BILLY (0.S.)
Daddy?

And then four even-spaced GUNSHOTS are heard, muffled and at
a distance. Then silence.

IN THE ScouT

We find David sitting alone in the blood-spattered vehicle,
the others slumped out of sight. He's holding himself coiled
tight, then lets out a howl of soul-rending anguish and

despair, dissolving into shuddering sobs of grief as he rocks
back and forth like a man in an asylum.

He puts the gun in his mouth, pulling the trigger again and
again, praying for a bullet to magically appear, but-no.

He gets hold of himsel£. Tosses the gun aside. Takes a few

deep breaths, steeling himself like a man getting ready to
jump into a pool of ice water, fumbles for the door handle...

Gets out...

OUTSIDE THE SCOUT

++,and slams the door. He stands there looking around at this
primordial, dead-white world. Seething.
diuy.

DAVID
COME ON!

He turns and lays his hands on the Scout's roof, waiting.
And waiting. And waiting. And...
And...

Here it comes...something big...a deep growling noise...coming
closer...approaching in the Mist...

...and now comes another sound as well...weird, wavering in
the Mist...unidentifiable, unearthly...

PUSH IN TIGHT ON DAVID as he gazes up, listening...waiting...

...and he looks around, increasingly stunned as the day seems
to brighten...

..-and now the sound is deafening, the deep growl descending
upon us, becoming a HUGE ROAR...

That roar? Tank treads?
And the other wavering sound...

A voice? On loudspeaker?

And now the day goes brighter still as the Mist starts to
part, dissipating as blazing lights burn through the haze,
mounted on a tank, and FIGURES in eerie hazmat combat suits
come cradling weapons, entering the hot zone, sweeping the
area, a VOICE BOOMING like God from the mounted speakers...

VOICE
ATTENTION. ..ALL SURVIVORS. ..THIS
AREA IS UNDER MILITARY CONTROL. ..ALL
SURVIVORS REPORT TO OUR PERSONNEL
FOR ESCORT TO THE NEAREST AID
STATION. . .

..and the Mist clears completel: ,» sun breaking through, world
turning green again as the soldiers come trudging, their ranks

stretching into the distance, and several of them see David
and come this way to help him, but:

David doesn't see them. David doesn’t hear them. David never
will. David is clutching the roof of the Scout. SCREAMING.

And SCREAMING. And SCREAMING. And SCREAMING.

Davia will never stop.
