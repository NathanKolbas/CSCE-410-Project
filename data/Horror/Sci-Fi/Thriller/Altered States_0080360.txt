WIDE ANGLE SHOT of a sound-attenuated room. The walls 6
are porous, blue steel. The lighting is hidden and
subdued; the room is mostly in shadow. Dominating the
room, standing as it does in the middle of it, is a
large, covered, wooden tank, painted black, looking
sacrificial and sinister. The CAMERA just stares at it --

NARRATION
The tank itself was nothing more
than a large tomb-like bathtub made
out of plywood and lined with aluminun,
and half-filled with a ten percent
solution of magnesium sulfate in
water to increase buoyancy --

LEGEND: THE CORNELL MEDICAL COLLEGE IN NEW YORK CITY
- 1967

ANOTHER ANGLE. Our eyes have become accustomed to the
subdued lighting. We notice a few valves sticking out
of the tank, a few cables and hoses trailing across the
floor from it. There is a small worktable against a
wall and two wooden footstools, four feet high, near
the tank. We note some clothing in a shadowed corner
of the room -- a pair of jeans, a T-shirt, a pea-jacket,
underwear, socks, shoes, a large bath towel.

NARRATION
Inside the tank, the subject
floated in utter darkness and utter
silence, effectively deprived of
sensory stimulation, alone, isolated.
At first, it had been presumed that
such conditions would produce
feelings of paranoia, but for the
most part, that didn't happen. Of
the twenty-three students tested,
only two showed signs of anxiety --

INT. THE TANK ITSELF

Cheat just enough light to distinguish the whitish form
of a naked MAN, floating in the darkness, just below
the surface of the inky water, like a huge dead fish
with it's belly up --

CLOSEUP LOOKING DOWN on the Man's face, a white mask
of a face, eyes closed, an austere Calvinist face -- a
young man, twenty-eight years old. We may notice eight
EEG leads issuing out of his scalp.

NARRATION (cont'd) 6
-- The others reported experiences
ranging from pleasant to exhilarating.

The SCREEN suddenly goes utterly BLACK --

NARRATION (cont'd)
It seemed that depriving a man of
external stimuli simply triggered
a whole new set of internal
stimuli --

Suddenly, the briefest of IMAGES flicks across the
BLACK SCREEN, a sudden narrow band of color, mud-brown,
much too brief for us to identify anything except that
it happened --

NARRATION (cont'd)
Dr. Jessup found the encephalographic
evidence especially interesting --

CLOSEUP of JESSUP'S monastic face again, for identifi-
cation purposes -=

NARRATION (cont'd)
Within minutes after the activating
experience, well organized alpha
waves of forty to fifty micro-volts,
eleven to twelve seconds, appeared
in all regions +--

Again, a fleeting band of IMAGERY, a broader BAND,
lasting just long enough for us to see that the grains
in the wood that form the interior walls of the tank,
behind the black aluminum interior lining of the tank,
are SINUATING, as if they were alive --

NARRATION (cont'd)
-- After fifteen minutes, there
was an increase in the alpha
amplitude, as much as thirty to
seventy micro-volts, predominantly
in the frontal and central regions --

The SCREEN suddenly, briefly, takes on a GRAY sheen,
and then, as abruptly, it foes BLACK again --

NARRATION (cont'd)
At the half hour mark, rhythmical
waves of seven to eight seconds
appeared, and then, suddenly --

ANOTHER FLEETING IMAGE: too quick to be really dis
tinguishable, a vivid, baked--oranged FLASH with some~
thing WHITE and RED in it. It's on-SCREEN just long
enough for us to possibly recognize the white as some
kind of animal --

thru
NARRATION (cont'd) 6
~- rhythmical theta trains, six to
seven seconds, seventy to one
hundred micro-volts. This EEG
pattern was startling similar to
those of Zen priests in zazen. Dr.
Jessup founa this fascinating,
and, one Saturday afternoon in
April 1967, he decided to try
the experience for himself --

The IMAGES begin to come with increasing quickness now --
IMAGE: A stunted, dwarfed FIG TREE, shedding it's fruit --
IMAGE: A rocky TERRAIN, the barren Judean hills --

IMAGE: The ANIMAL we saw so briefly before, this time
perhaps recognizable as a lamb, a white lamb, with seven
eyes and seven horns. Its throat is slashed. It is
dripping blood --

IMAGE: The entire SCREEN is suddenly WHITE, radiant
white, near-to-blinding white --

SOUND: A sudden blare of CATHEDRAL NUSIC, organ music,
a snatch of Bach. A second later, it stops --

IMAGE: A twisted Biblical street, empty, a crooked,
narrow, cobbled street, twisting between the pitted
white walls of small stone buildings --

IMAGE: The SCREEN is utterly BLACK again --
SOUND: Jessup's BREATHING --

IMAGE: A fluttering image of a GREEN VERONICA, one of
those religious handkerchiefs with the face of Christ
painted on it, a chalk-white face of an anguished Christ
with little red kewpie doll spots on his cheeks, a crown
of thorns on his brow --

IMAGE: An expanse of surreal landscape -- an endless
stretch of brilliantly white beach -~

IMAGE: The sacrificial WHITE LAMB again, this time
lying on a rude stone altar. A curved KNIFE, held in
a white hand, comes slashing down and cuts the lamb's
throat. A BURST OF BLOOD =~

INAGE: A HAN lying dying on a white hospital bed in a
lemon-colored hospital room ~--

IMAGE: A CLOSER VIEW of the Man's FACE, a waxen~mask.
A bubble of air forms on nis lips which barely move;
ne is trying to say something. It‘s inaudible.

IMAGE: The green Veronica with the white Christ-face 6
painted on it.

IMAGE: Beads of red BLOOD dripping from above against
a white SCREEN --

IMAGE: A hailstorm of HAIL and BLOOD --

IMAGE: The SCREEN is BLACK again, the blackness of
space. A humming, droning SOUND, resonating, getting
louder, the drone of primal energy. A PINSPOT of
twinkling light, a distant star it would seem moving
toward us. After a moment, we recognize it isn't a
star, but an enormous bird, a black bird. It seems to
have a human face, the face of a suffering saint, an
agonized, martyr's face, complete with halo. The bird
is ba, the eternal soul of pharaonic Egypt. The face
is St. Sebastian's. It veers in its flight and comes
swooping horribly at us, filling the screen with its
enormous black wings --

IMAGE: The rude stone altar with the sacrificial white
LAMB on it. The blood drips from its slashed throat.
PAN DOWN the altar to the ground where a large pool of
blood has formed. A YOUNG WOMAN kneels at the edge of
the pool of blood. Her back is toward us. She is naked,
is washing a white Biblical robe in the pool of blood.
She becomes aware that she is being watched. She looks
over her shoulder at us. She is exquisitely beautiful.
She stands, faces us, a strikingly white young woman,
holding her robe, which, despite its bathing in blood,
is white and pure. PAN UP the altar to the sacrificial
lamb lying atop it. Its throat is still cut, its blood
still dripping, but its face is now the face of Christ
that was on the green Veronica, the chalk-white face
with the red kewpie doll spots on its cheeks and the
crown of thorns on its head.

IMAGE: Total, silent BLACKNESS. Suddenly, an EXPLOSION,
a shattering flash of brilliant whiteness fills the
SCREEN. A high-pitched SCREAMING DRONE of energy.

Waves of different colors pulsate and throb across the
SCREEN. One such wave bends, wrinkles, pinches up, and
the first particle of matter is created. The SCREEN

is instantly filled with innumerable FLASHES, as the
most primitive bits of matter smash and whirl maniacally.
Flares of collision. The blinding luminoslty of an
earlier Universe fades into the soft glow of a cooling
cloud of primordial hydrogen --

IMAGE: A small room with bare walls. Jessup and the
beautiful young Woman in a momentary fever of sexuality.
He has seized her from behind. His hands clutch her
breasts. He ravishes her neck with kisses and biting.
She has thrown her head back, her neck arched in
voluptuous pleasure --

IMAGE: A quick series of flickering images as Jessup thru
experiences an ontological dematuration -- Jessup as
embryo of eight months, then as of two weeks, then as
a zygote, then as a single original cell; and then back
up again until, with a SCREAH, Jessup re~experiences
the moment of his birth, his expulsion from his mother's
uterus, gasping, suffocating, screaming --

IMAGE: The small room with bare walls. A BED. On the
bed, Jessup and the Young Woman, naked, in the throes of
exuberant intercourse. Jessup plunging, thrusting.
Jessup's sweating face, his eyes wide open, his mouth
agape, as if this experience was one of shattering
metapnhysicality. Beneath nim, the white body of the
Young Woman twists, responds, her legs lock themselves
around Jessup's waist. Her head twists this way and
that. Her face, we suddenly notice, is the face of
Christ on the handkerchief, chalk-white with red spots
on her cheeks and a crown of thorns on her head. CAMERA
MOVES IN on the Christ-face. OVER this, the SOUND of
Jessup's breathing, the short, staccato panting of a man
on the verge of orgasm --

We are suddenly back inside the tank. Jessup's white 11
mask of a face, eyes closed, cushioned in the BLACKNESS
Of the interior of the tank. OVER this, Jessup's dis-
embodied sexual PANTING continues, rising to crescendo.
At which point, his body suddenly thrashes; his legs
kick and splash the black water on which he floats.

The white mask of a face remains serene and unciianged.
Suddenly, everything is silent again, silent and black,
except for Jessup's white, sleeping face. Slowly, his
eyes open --

INT. ISOLATION TANK ROOM - DAY 12

WIDE ANGLE SHOT of the room, the black tank sitting 13
isolated in the middle, shrouded in shadow.

CLOSER SHOT LOOKING DOWN onto the tank, as the lid is
raised, and Jessup stands in the tank up to his waist

in water. He removes the EEG leads from his scalp. The
door in the back of the room opens, and ARTHUR ROSENBERG,
a thin, dark, wiry young man in his late twenties, wearing
casual clothes, enters, crosses down to the tank to help
Jessup clamber out. The conversation is matter-of-fact.
13

ROSENBERG 13
How do you feel?

JESSUP
Not bad. I hallucinated like a
son-of-a-bitch. A variety of
dream states, mystical states,
a lot of religious allegory, mostly
out of Revelation.

He's at the corner of the room now where his clothing
is, toweling himself, putting on his shorts and pants
as he and Rosenberg chat.

ROSENBERG
You were in there close to five
hours.

JESSUP

It felt like an hour.

ROSENBERG
I'd like to try that myself sometime.

JESSUP
You should, you'll like it.
Trousered but still toweling, he heads for the door in
the back through which Rosenberg had entered. He goes
into --

INT. MONITORING ROOM ~ DAY 14

~~ a small room, compactly fitted up with an oscillator
and a variety of recording machines, most noticeable a

16 styli EEG machine. Five hours of polygraph paper
have piled into the cardboard bin at its side. Jessup
rummages about in the bin for the beginning of the

sheet, puts on a pair of wire-rimmed glasses, and studies
the tracings --

JESSUP
(as he reads)
Did we have any communication?

ROSENBERG
(standing in the
doorway behind)
Oh, sure, I kept checking you out
like you told me to.

JESSUP
How'd I respond?
14 ROSEWBERG 14
Very orderly. At one point, you
were crying.

JESSUP
You mean, really crying?

ROSENBERG
You were sobbing, you had tears
on your face. I asked you what
was going on. You said you were
re-experiencing your father's death.

JESSUP
Did you make notes?

ROSENBERG
(indicating a loose-
leaf notebook)
It's all there.

JESSUP
I'd like to do this again next
week, Arthur. Could you make it
again next week?

14A EXT. CORNELL MEDICAL BLDG. - YORK AVE = LATE AFTERNOON 14A

ROSENBERG
What're we looking for?

JESSUP
Hell, I don't know. There's
really very little literature on
this kind or research. There's
some good people in the field --
Tart, Ornstein, Deikman -- but
most of it is radical-hip stuff,
Grug-culture apologias. Obviously,
the first thing to do is set up
some sensible methodology, see if
we can't study these experiences
under controlled laboratory
conditions. It won't interfere
with the work we're doing with
Hobart.

ROSENBERG
What're we getting into, sensory-
deprivation? Isolation studies?
I mean, where will we be going
with this tank stuff?

JESSUP
We're not writing up a grant, Arthur.

Strictly bootlegging just for kicks.
I figure as long as we've got the
use of this tank, let's play
around with it, let's find out
where it takes us. This is
fascinating stuff, Arthur, and I
think we ought to get into it --

INT. ROSENBERG'S APARTMENT - SUNDAY BRUNCH - DAY 15

A party of young intellectuals of the 1960's -- a lot
of denim and jeans, subdued Janis Joplin on the stereo
and joints being passed around. About a dozen PEOPLE,
all in their late twenties or early thirties, except
for a sculptress who is a sray-haired and aggressive
fifty. There is a geneticist and his wife, a biochem-
ist and her husband, a couple of clinical psychiatrists.
The Rosenberg apartment consists of four small rooms
clustered around a central hallway in one of those
battered old buildings on West End Avenue in the 90s.
There is a great deal of movement in and out of the
rooms —--

INT. ROSENBERG APARTMENT - HALLWAY - DAY 16
and

Arthur Rosenberg and ALAN HOBART, a clinical psychia- 17

trist in his early thirties, are sharing a joint with

a very pretty, confident young woman in jeans who

doesn't even look her twenty-four years. Her name is

EMILY FULBKIGHT. She is a physical anthropologist.

She is our heroine. In b.g., general party activity.

ROSENBERG
-- I didn't even know they had one
of those isolation tanks at New
York Hospital ~-

HOBART
Must be some guys in the psychology
department doing sensory-deprivation
studies. What's Jessup doing with
it?

ROSENBERG
You got me. He's been taking
students out of nis classes and
testing them. He's been doing
this for three, four months, did
you know he was into this kind of
stuff?

HOBART
Not till you just told me.

SYLVIA

ROSENBERG

(who had started

for the door, re-

Hobart )
He's the last guy in the world I
figurea to be screwing around with
anything as flaky as altered states
of consciousness.

HOBART
Well, let's face it, Jessup is
pretty flaky himself.

Across the three of them down the length of the hall-
way to the front door where Sylvia Rosenberg is now
admitting Jessup with much hugging and affection --

ROSENBERG
(to Emily)
That's him.

Emily is clearly interested in the man. She openly
appraises him from her end of the hallway, apparently
likes the bespectacled, monkish, fine featured face.
SYLVIA ROSENBERG herds Jessup into the living room.

TWENTY WINUTES LATER ~ DAY

INT. HALLWAY NEAR LIVING ROOM - DAY 19

Emily comes out of the kitchen, crosses into --

INT. KITCHEN - DAY 20

where she stands a moment, surveying the room. We're
having Jimi Hendrix on the STEREO now. The room doesn't
have too much furniture -- an overstuffed chair on which
Sylvia is heavily emplanted, and a sofa, at one end of
which Jessup is seated. At the other end of the couch,
the Sculptress is sort of making a play for the genet-
icist's Wife. There 1s an open space on the couch next
to Jessup for which Emily heads, not all that easy a
journey since the rest of the people in the room are
lounging about on Levantine cushions on the floor or
perched on the enormous round coffee table in the middle.

Jessup seems a bit out of things, distracted by his own20

thoughts.

A joint is being passed around. When it

reaches Jessup, he declines to puff but passes it along
to the biochemist sitting on a wooden folding chair at

his elbow.

Emily slides into the open seat beside him.

EMILY
Arthur says you're very shy, and
he wants me to draw you out.

JESSUP
Draw me out? Doesn't sound like
Arthur.

EMILY

Well, what he actually said was
you were a high-handed, arrogant
prick, a little nuts but brilliant,
and that if I ever got you talking,
I would find you fascinating.

JESSUP
That sounds more like Arthur.

He says you're doing some work
with him and Alan Hobart at
Payne-Whitney.

JESSUP
Yes.

EMILY
What sort of work?

JESSUP
Toxic metabolite stuff.

for more; he presses on with little enthusiasm.

“ JESSUP

We're more or less replicating
Heath's and Friedhof's strategies,
trying to find maverick substances
specific to schizophrenia. I
think we're chasing our tails.
What do you do?

aren't you?

I'm twenty-four.

JESSUP
That's still pretty good. I
didn't get my Ph.D. until I was
twenty-five, and I'm supposed
to be a whiz kid.

EMILY
I'm a whiz kid too.

JESSUP
Where's Arthur? Where's the
mustard?

Emily shows Jessup where the mustard is.

JESSUP
Anthropology seems to attract
good-looking women.

EMILY
Thank you.

They smile agreeably at each other; they have obviously
hit it off well.

EXT. COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY CAMPUS - SEVERAL HOURS LATER 20A

Emily and Jessup walk across campus. They are engrossed
in each other.

JESSUP
I've always been interested in
interior experiences, especially
the religious experience. The
only reason I'm working with
schizophrenics now is because the
religious experience is so
significant in schizophrenia.

JESSUP
... And there's just so much you
can do with animals. I worked with
monkeys for two years. But
monkeys can't tell you what's going
on in their consciousness. You
need human beings for that. And
you're not allowed to ablate human
beings, and you can't stick
electrodes in their skulls. So I
have to use some kind of trance-
inducing technique, and the
isolation tank seemed the least
risky.

Their eyes catch. There is clearly something alive
between them.

JESSUP
Listen, I'd like to go home with
you tonight, will that be all
right with you?

EMILY
I have a roommate, we'll be
confined to the living room couch.

JESSUP
What's wrong with the living room
couch?

EMILY

You tend to slip off a lot.

JESSUP
I'm sure we'll manage.

INT. EMILY'S FLAT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Dark. Two white bodies thrashing on the dark sofa.
Culmination. Emily thrusts up, burying her face in
Jessup's shoulder to avoid crying out. His moonlit
back beaded with sweat. She subsides back onto the
sofa, opens her eyes --

HER POV - Jessup's transfixed face. His eyes are wide
open, rigidly staring into space, entranced.

EMILY
What are you thinking about?

For a moment, he doesn't seem to hear her. Then, the
entranced look dissipates --

JESSUP
(mutters )
God, Jesus, crucifixions.

He rolls off her, slides down onto the floor, his back
against her legs.

EMILY
Well, just so long as it wasn't
another woman.

Nevertheless, it had been a curious moment and an odd

thing to say. She tries to see his face in the dark-

ness, finally slips off the sofa and joins him sitting
on the floor leaning back against the sofa.

EMILY
As a rule, do you usually think
about Christ and crucifixions
under sexual stress?

JESSUP

(takes a moment to

consider his answer)
When I was nine years old, I used
to see visions, visions of saints
and angels, even Christ himself.
I saw him with the eyes of faith,
hanging on the cross, his vesture
dipped in blood. I had a whole
cult that grew up around me.
People came from all over to see
this kid who had visions of Christ.
I got mixed up with a little
Pentacostal church in South Yonkers.
In the middle of services, I would
suddenly become transfixed, begin
to babble in voices, and I would
prophesy. Of course, I don't do
that any more, not since I was
sixteen.

What happened? I mean, how did
a little kid who saw visions of
Christ turn into a physiologist
teaching at the Cornell Medical
College?

He looks at her for the first time, agreeably but
strangely detached.

JESSUP
I stopped believing. It was very
dramatic. My father died a
protracted and painful death of
cancer. I was sixteen years old
and very fond of my father. I
used to race to the hospital
every day after school and sit in
his room doing my homework. He
was very heavily sedated. The
last few weeks he was in coma.
One day, I thought I heard him say
something, I looked up. His lips
were moving, but no sound came out.
There was his yellow-waxen face
on the white pillow, and his lips
were moving.. A little bubble
formed on his lips. I got up and
leaned over him, my ear an inch
away from his lips. "Did you say
something, Pop?" Then, I heard
the word he was desperately trying
to say, a soft hiss of a word. He
was saying: “Terrible -- terrible!"
So the end was terrible, even for
the good people like my father. So
the purpose of all our suffering
was just more suffering. By dinner
time, I had dispensed with God
altogether. I never saw another
vision. I haven't told anybody
about this in ten years. I'm
telling you now because I want you
to know what sort of a nut you
might be getting mixed up with.

They stare at each other in the dark room.

EXT. 68TH AND YORK AVENUE - DECEMBER 1967 - DAY 24

Bright, sunny day. Emily, in winter coat and jeans,
flusned a cheerful red by the cold weather, crossing
the courtyard in front of New York Hospital. She turns
up a pathway to Payne-Whitney; we know it's Payne-
Whitney because there is a sign clearly marked: Payne-
Whitney Psychiatric Clinic.

INT. CORRIDOR - PAYNE-WHITHEY ~ DECEMBER 1967 - DAY 25

Long institutional corridor. A white-coated DOCTOR
(aged 45) brings a WOMAN PATIENT down the hall. The
Woman is twenty-eight years old, wears ordinary street
clothes, a blouse and jeans, but is manifestly mad. She
has that razor-sharp look, and she glgsles and shuffles
as the Doctor moves her along.

A stairway door opens, and Emily enters, pauses by the
door to let the Patient and Doctor pass; they disapoear
into a room down the hall. Emily heads for the door
just before that one.

INT. AN OBSERVATION ROOM = DAY 26

as Emily enters. Jessup is already there, standing,
observing through the one-way window. He wears a
rumpled sports jacket, slipover sweater, shapeless
chinos. Through the window, we can see into a family-
therapy room where the Patient we had seen in the hall-
way a moment before is now being seated on a leather
chair, the sort of chair which can unfold back into a
reclining chair. Alan Hobart, in a long doctor’s coat,
is being reassuring to the Patient. We can HEAR his
friendly voice via a speaker on the wall.

HOBART'S VOICE
(on speaker)
You're looking really fine today,
Phyllis, much less agitated than
last time. Are you feeling better?

The Patient giggles, shuffles her feet, stares vaguely
at the floor.

Emily joins Jessup at the window; they exchange a brief
smile.

In the therapy room, Rosenberg, also in a long white
doctor's coat, is reading from the Patient's records
on a clipboard. A MEDICAL TECHNICIAN, (young woman,
aged twenty-five), also in doctor's coat, is preparing
the EEG leads. They also greet the Patient affably:
the Patient sits, giggling, her head bobbing.

them? Doctor Antonini is standing
right here in the room with you,
so there's nothing to worry about.
We'll put the EEG leads on you now,
if it's okay with you.

The Patient responds to nothing, stares emptily at the
floor. Hobart tells the Technician to go ahead with

the application of the leads, which she does. Rosenberg,
holding blood pressure equipment, pulls up a chair with
an amiable ~=-

ROSENBERG'S VOICE
(over the speaker)
How's it going, Phyllis?

He wraps the blood pressure cuff around her arm, takes
her pressure.

In the Observation Room, Emily and Jessup stand sil-
ently, side by side at the window, observing.

EMILY
(after a moment)

Well,.it's settled. Metcalfe
spoke to Spencer again this morning,
and it's definite -- the job's
mine. So I'll be in Nairobi doing
my post-doec work iiay, June and
July, and, in September, I'll be
teaching at Harvard.

JESSUP
Terrific.

EMILY
So it looks like we'll both be
teaching at Harvard in September.

JESSUP
Looks that way.

Unable to keep her cool any longer, Emily turns to face
Jessup, her face glowing with delight.

ENILY
ily God, Eddie, you can't get any
tidler than that! We're going to .
be together in Goston and I think we *
should get married.

The idea had to come up sooner or

JESSUP
You know, of course, I'm supposed
to be at least a little bit nuts.

EMILY
A little bit! You're a mad monk,
an unmitigated madman. -- So you
don't have to tell me how weird
you are. I know how weird you are.
I'm the girl in your bed the last
three months and even sex is a
mystical experience for you. You
carry on like a flagellant, which
can be very nice, but I sometimes
wonder if it's me that's being
made love to. I feel like I'm being

the act of receiving God.

Hobart makes a note in his notebook.

EMILY
-- You're -- a Faust freak, Eddie.
You'd sell your soul to find the
great truth. Well, human life
doesn't have great truths. We're
born screaming in doubt, and we
spend our lives persuading ourselves
we're actually alive. One of the
ways we know we're alive is we love
each other. Like I love you. I
can't imagine living without you.
So let's get married, and if it
turns out to be a disaster, it'll
be a disaster, and we'll shake
hands and say good-bye.

In the therapy room, Rosenberg is giving the Patient

JESSUP 26
(to Emily)
He's giving her dimethyltryptamine.
It takes effect in about a minute,
and she'll trip out for about
half an hour.

He abruptly leaves Emily's side and exits into the
therapy room, visible instantly through the one-way
window, moving in the b.g. of the room to stand over

the portable EEG machine, watching the tracings. In
f.g., we begin to see a noticeable change in the Patient.
She stops her giggling and shuffling, sits stiffly,

more controlled, and the vaguely terrified vacuity

of her expression abruptly changes to one of intense
concentration, almost trance-like. Hobart is asking

her his soft questions again --

HOBART'S VOICE
(over the speaker)
Do you feel different now?

PATIENT
(startlingly re-
sponsive)
Yes.
HOBART
Less anxious?
PATIENT
Much less.
HOBART

Do you have any special feelings?

PATIENT
(after a moment)
I feel like my heart is being
touched by Christ.

Jessup is back again in the monitoring room. They
watch Hobart draw a triangle on a slate and ask the
Patient to duplicate it. She manages to draw one leg
of the triangle but seems stumped after that.

JESSUP

There's a lot of religious
delusion among acute schizophrenics.
Some guys say scnizophrenics are
physically different from the rest
of us. It's almost as if they were
trying to change their physical
selves to adapt to their

Jessup is walking down Pinckney Street. He is seven
years olaer, and, when we see him closer on, we will
see he is beginning to bald just a bit. At the moment,
ne is trunaling his two-year-old DAUGHTER in a stroller
with his left hand and holding a large supermarket bag
of groceries with his right. Hopping along behind is
his five-year-old DAUGHTER. Jessup is in animated
discussion with a big, fully bearded, booniing bear of
aman, aged thirty-eight, MASON PARRISH. Two young
professors on a Saturday afternoon, and they look every

isn't much more orderly than the living room. Jessup's
work area is here, an honest three-drawer filing cabinet,
an escritoire, a wall lined with bookshelves and packed
with texts and journals and Jessup's own notes, thick
hardbound looseleaf notebooks, neatly labeled. The

rest of the room is in chaos. The large double bed

is still unmade, and yesterday's clothing is flung

over the backs of chairs or piled on the floor.

JESSUP
Well, don't be too upset. It's
an amicable separation. Nobody's
mad at anyone, and the marriage
itself was sufferable, as sufferable
as any of the others around. I
think I've played my part well.
I take the kids to the zoo. I stay

I romp with them when they're well.

other young married faculty members
talking infantile masturbation,

the department and whose tenure is
hanging by a thread. Emily's
quite content to go on with this
life. She insists she’s in love

she means is she prefers the
senseless pain we inflict on each
other to the pain we would other-
wise inflict on ourselves. But
I'm not afraid of that solitary
pain. In fact, if I don't strip
myself of ali this clatter and
clutter and ridiculous ritual,
I shall go out of my fucking mind.

sympathomimetic drugs like
strychnine, dextroamphetamine,
et cetera can sti:ulate the
retention of memory. But these
are all poisonous, addictive,
induce convulsions, and are alien
to the body. The fact that a small
chain of amino acids, ACTH four to
seven, a natural substance of the
body, is instrumental in fixing
memory is, I think, particularly
interesting. This, however,
raises another question. ACTH is
a peptide. Its secretory rates
are influenced by stress. Does
ACTH actually code learning or
does it only relate to hormonal
substances that formed aue to
stress? You really interested in

filling their burlap bags with mushrooms, branches of
small slender trees, leaves, petals, seed pods and white
tuberous roots, the last of which have to be dug out of

ACROSS THREE CHOSEN WOMEN in their shapeless cotton
dresses, squatting and kneeling, grinding roots and
buds and leaves and petals into varying degrees of
fineness. In b.g., the BRUJO'S shack, a ramshackle
clapboard shanty with a shaky overhang held up by two
rotting pilasters. Around a fire in a little clearing
in front of the shack sit Jessup and Eccheverria and
FOUR ESCOGIDOS, the chosen men.

50 ACROSS the men. around the fire with the shack in b.g.,

thru from which the fifth escogido, the man of power, the

a shaggy old man in his late 60's, whose earlier con-
tact with white civilization is affirmed by the shape-
less gray single~breasted jacket he wears, the white
like-the fringes of a prayer shawl. The fire they are
all sitting around is actually a primitive hearth
ground. Jessup has his notebook out and is putting a
fresh cassette into the tape recorder --

The Brujo smooths out the small blanket lying near
the fire and then begins to empty his burlap bag item
by item and, spacing them with some ceremony on the
blanket. The first item is a hunting knife, nearly
a foot in length and glistening blue in the fading
afternoon sunlight; then a soft, brown leather pouch;
with age, from which he extracts the ceremonial pipe,
a dark-reddish stem about ten inches long and a
blackened bowl.

Before placing each item on the blanket, the Brujo
addresses the four directions with the object,

chanting in a low whine. The other Escogidos,

squatting and sprawling around the fire, have been

and are biting peyote buttons, and they are stoned out
of their skulls. Jessup's tape recorder WHIRS and turns.

Digale que extienda la palma

ECCHEVERRIA
He wants you to hold the root.
Put out your hand with your palm
up --

Jessup edges closer to the old man and sticks out his
hand palm up. The Brujo carefully places the root
across the flat of Jessup's palm. Suddenly, he
separates Jessup's third and fourth fingers and deftly
slashes the joint with his hunting knife. Jessup,
shocked, screams, He is so startled, he just squats
there with his bleeding hand outstretched. The Brujo
seizes his wrist and pulls the bleeding hand over the
pot. He twists Jessup's wrist so that the stark
white root falls into the pot. He holds Jessup's

hand over the pot until a few drops of blood fall into
the blackness of the ground behind him, shocked and
spent, sick with a sense of outrage --

ECCHEVERRIA
(leaning over him)
Are you all right?

Jessup nods.

The Brujo and one of the other men are now carrying the
pot to the ritual blanket. In the night, they seem
like monstrous shadows. Jessup tries to examine his
bleeding hand in the darkness --

JESSUP
(mutters)
Jesus Christ --

A form looms over him. He looks up. It's the old

Brujo holding out a cup of the liquid, expressionlessly.

Jessup sits up, takes the cup, and drinks. He gets

up on his knees and then stands and EXITS THE CAVE INTO EXTERIOR
the darkness. Behind him, he hears the Brujo and

Eccheverria mumbling in Spanish --

THE BRUJO (VOICE OVER)
(referring to the tape recorder)
Esta trabajando la grabadora?
Esta fumando tres partes de
polvo de honguitos con una parte
de polvo de sinicuiche y una parte
de pipoloxochital --

Jessup's body suddenly becomes two bodies. 50
One remains huddled on its knees vomiting; the other thru
slowly takes shape outside the first body and then 56

as suddenly WHOOSHES UP into the sky until he is
hardly more than a spot, visible only because of a
curious LUMINOSITY about him. Down around the fire,
the other men seem entirely innocent of this extra-
ordinary event. A mangy dog wanders into the ring

of sprawling men, sniffs at Jessup's first body, still
on its knees; in the darkness a few yards away from
the others --

The SCREEN is now a dull, matted WHITE, streaked, as
if painted on with heavy impasto wipes of a big

brush. The yellow of the lizard slowly leaks out into
the whiteness, staining it. Losing its color, the
lizard disappears --

On the yellowing whiteness of the screen, a strange
pulpy shape appears, fissured and creviced, a grayish
blob, recognizable perhaps to biologists as a human
brain, which instantly folds and slithers into itself
to take on other pulpy shapes, changing into soft,
pulsating globules of matter, insinuatingly sexual in
appearance, oleaginous in movement; what we are, in
fact, watching is a de-evolution of the brain, as it
passes backward across the evolutionary continuum
through the brain of an alligator, to that of a cod-
fish, until it oozes into the primitive, linear ridged
nervous system of a worm -- It all disappears --

Another biological dematuration process -- blobs of
substance, grayish in color, slowly, constantly fold-
ing and unfolding into different momentary shapes,
from the curled up, loaf-like cracked and creviced
adult brain, oozing into the more simplified shapes
of the brain of a 6-month embryo; to the bulging
vermiform structure of the brain of a 7-week embryo;
a bulbous, shapeless thing; turning into -- finally
-- the brain of a 3-week embryo, hardly more than a
hose-like structure with something stuck in its
gullet, the bulging tip of a prosencephalon hanging
down at the end of the thick snake-like thing as if
it were ashamed --

The SCREEN, all of everything, begins to get DARKER
and DARKER until everything, all of the SCREEN, is
silently, impenetrably BLACK --

Infinitely down below a tiny flickering spot, per-
haps the last conscious image of the fire Jessup had
been sitting around --

Then ~~ suddenly -- an unbearable, blinding FLASH of
pure white light incandesces the entire SCREEN a
fraction of a second of explosion of pure energy --

Then, it is all BLACK again --
50
thru
56

37.

Enormous FLAMES, unbeiievably hot, out of which 50
emanate sudden, violent EXPLOSIONS and flares -- wee

Suddenly, one of these white-orange flares zigzags
across the flaming face of the SCREEN, like a
crevasse opening up in arctic ice --

Suddenly, nothing is left to see but this jagged
crack stretching obliquely up and across the SCREEN,
as if the screen were about to crack open --

Everything else is BLACK --
The crack is flaming red, then purple, then blue --

A violent series of sudden images, none of which last
longer than a second --

A flaming cloud of gases, hydrogen and helium, WHOOSHES
across the black screen at 90,000,000 mph, throbbing

as it cools and contracts with gravity -- another such
cloud -- another ~-

A huge spiral-shaped cloud WHOOSHES across the SCREEN,
condensing into blue, condensing into trillions of
stars, an embryo galaxy --

A blue cloud of gases, now getting hotter and hotter
and redder and redder as its trillions and trillions
of atomic bits crush in on each other because of
their mutual gravitational attraction -- the cloud is
now a flaming ball -- a star, a sun. At the eritical
level of 20,000,0000F. it ignites and burns -- nuclear
EXPLOSION follows nuclear explosion --

One of the spiral arms of the Mikly Way galaxy -- the
swirling tendrils of the primal mist -- a water
molecule freezing into a crystal of ice -- a flaming
yellow globe-like mass, the sun, Surrounded by an
iridescent halo of ice crystals and grains of rock or
iron ~- the coalescence of small fragments into a
larger fragment as the central fragment sweeps its
neighboring fragments into its &ravitational pull --

An endless expanse of cold, airless, waterless rock --
It begins to leak bubbles and beads of boiling radio-
activity -- a cloud of yellow sulphurous steam -- A
falling of yellow rain --

A silent, sable SEA of water, motionless, fills the
SCREEN --

All the above flickering imagery has taken place
across the blue, jagged crack that seems to be split-
ting the SCREEN. The crack never disappears, it is a
constant presence --
50
thru
56

38.

The crack suddenly ERUPTS spewing blinding light out 50
like lava, the First Cabalistic emanation of thru
light -- 56

Everything abruptly condenses back into BLACKNESS
again. The blue crack has disappeared. In its place,
a brownish figure, if it could be called a figure,
more of a molten mass of substance which appears to
have arms and legs and a head, but so protean of form
that the limbs and other distinguishing features keep
dissolving into itself and extruding out of itself,
bubbling up here and there, swelling and contracting.
It moves in surf-like emanations of itself, expanding
and lapping out of itself in slow exorable waves --

A high-pitched SCREAM of exultancy --

The molten mass emerges larger and larger. Its sub-
stance seems to be iridescent, flaring with tiny
flames --

Behind it, the SCREEN is now GOLD --

A sudden CLOSER VIEW of the molten mass -- The tiny
flames are tiny exploding neural matter.

At his feet, the large yellow iguana, its pre-historic
jaws slightly agape, its tongue flicking in and out --

The lizard waddles across the expanse of GOLDEN SCREEN
towards the pulsating, flaring mass of brown substance
-- It stops about halfway; the lizard is suddenly wary,
frightened -- It edges on slowly, cautiously --

Suddenly, it is engulfed by the flaming molten sub-
stance -- Its limbs are wrenched, ripped with a
sickening SCREAM of bone and muscle, out of their
sockets. The pieces of the lizard are lifted up with-
in the molten substance by the improvisations of arms,
and the shapeless head bows to devour the lizard --

It slowly surges around him --

The golden SCREEN takes on a reddish hue. The brown,
orange, yellow objects on it lose their definition in
the merger of colors --

Again, the high-pitched SCREAM of exultancy --

The SCREEN is totally BLACK again --

There is the feeling of a bottomless shaft -- a WHOOSH
of precipitous descent --

We seem to be seeing things now in a BLACK LIGHT. The
SCREEN seems filled with the branches of a tree -- In
the black distance, there seems to be a campfire
flickering in the wind --

EXT. THE HINCHI VALLEY - OUTSIDE THE BRUJO'S SHACK - 57
NIGHT ” ar

Nighttime in a valley in the mountains of Central
Mexico. Eccheverria, the Brujo, the other four
Escogidos, sprawled around their fire, a couple of
them asleep. About 20 yards away in the darkness,
just on the fringe of the light of the fire, barely
visible, Jessup is standing in a bosk of bushes. He
is urinating. --

REVERSE ACROSS Jessup as he zips up his shorts and
shuffles back to the others around the fire.
Eccheverria looks up briefly. Otherwise, nobody
notices his return. In b.g., under the overhang of
the Brujo's shack, two of the Chosen Women sit in
shadowy bundles of sleep. A dog drifts through the
bodies around the fire, momentarily illuminated by the
firelight.

Jessup silently joins the group, sinks onto the ground,
lies back and is instantly asleep --

EXT. OUTSIDE THE BRUJO'S HOUSE - NEXT A.M. - DAY 60
thru

Cheerful bright sunlight floods the valley. Jessup, 65

stripped to the waist, is doing his morning wash

from an improvised tin washtank beside the Brujo's

shack. He is chatting with Eccheverria who is lean-

ing against the shack. Jessup seems in excellent

spirits. Two of the Escogidos are still sleeping it

off around the dead fire. A third Escogido is off

in b.g. urinating. The Brujo comes out of his shack,

watches Jessup towelling his face off, ambles over to

where Jessup and Eccheverria are standing --

THE BRUJO
Obtuvo la experience predicha?

ECCHEVERRIA
He wants to know if you had the
experience that was predicted
for you.

The old shaman scowls at Jessup and then shuffles 60
off for the bushes where Jessup had returned from thru
his hallucination, some 15 yards away. He turns 65

back after a few steps and clearly wants them to
follow. Jessup and Eccheverria start after him. The
Brujo pushes his way into the scratchy bosk, spread-
ing the branches, holding them aside for Jessup and
Eccheverria to pass by. After a few paces, the Brujo
stops and points to the ground about ten yards to
their right. Jessup and Eccheverria turn to look --

ACROSS Jessup and Eccheverria. It is not quite clear
just what it 1s that is lying on the ground, somewhat
shrouded as it is by all the network of branches and
hidden by four dogs who are swarming over it, eating
it with the savagery of jackals. Jessup pushes into
the thick tangle of bush, a few more paces, followed
by Eccheverria. Then, they both stop, as the realiza-
tion of what they are going to see strikes them both.
They both involuntarily close their eyes for a moment.
Eccheverria turns away. The Brujo behind them shouts
at the dogs who back slowly away snarling. One of them
has the leg of something in his mouth --

JESSUP'S POV. Lying in a gel of dried blood and
leaves is the ravaged dismembered torso cf what had
been a green crested iguana, terrifyingly legless, the
empty white bone of the leg sockets white and flecked
with blood. Half the torso has been stripped of its
greenish skin, and gobbets of raw flesh and exposed
viscera are open to view. Over this, the SOUND of a
man wretching, and the shouts of the Brujo keeping
the dogs off. The dogs can't wait to get back to the
feast. A dog lunges in, grabs one of the lizard legs
lying a foot away and makes off with it --

Eccheverria is bent over, holding onto a branch of a
bush, vomiting. Jessup has turned aside and is shad-
ing his eyes against the sight. The dogs immediately
plunge back to the feast. The Brujo turns and makes
his way back out of the busnes into the clearing --

EXT. OUTSIDE THE BRUJO'S HOUSE - DAY 66

Jessup is checking out his gear, his sleeping bag, 68

tape recorder, notebooks. Eccheverria is packing his
sleeping bag. In b.g., occasional signs of tribal
activity --

just to make the gringo look
like a fool --

: ECCHEVERRIA
You asked me what happened, and
I told you. You were crawling
around on your hands and knees
for awhile. Then, around seven-
thirty, you got up and went to
those bushes, to urinate, I
thought. Then it sounded like
some of the dogs had jumped you.
There was a great deal of yelping
and snarling and growling. Then
you screamed. Or something
screamed. And I and a couple of
the women went to see if you were
in any trouble. We had just about
gotten to the bushes when the
screaming stopped, and the old
Brujo yelled at us to come back
and forget it --

Jessup scowls, frowns, packs all his gear into one
bundle, lashes it tightly --

JESSUP
Do you think they'd let me take
some of that mixture I smoked
back to Boston?

An endocrinology lab. A small Christmas tree is in
evidence. Parrish, a Grad Student, and an Endocrino-
logy Fellow are standing by a scintillation counter, a
large square aluminum contraption that looks like a
dishwasher except it has a digital recording device
which is rattling off red digits at the moment. In
b.g., a Second Grad Student and two Lab Technicians,
each at their desks, cutting microtomal sections or
tending to the rats (there are five cages of them),
or whatever one does in endocrinology labs. They are
variously dressed. Parrish has his long, white
doctor's coat on.

checking the EEG leads on Jessup's skull. The open
doorway in b.g. suddenly fills up with Parrish, un-
buttoning his coat. Rosenberg, backing off the foot-
stool, carefully leading out the wire leads, notices
him --

He looks down into the tank, CAMERA looks with him.
Jessup lies in the tank, floating nakedly just below
the surface of the inky black water, motionless, a
faint almost imperceptible shimmering of white. His
ankles are resting on what seems to be a surgical dam,
his head on a headrest. He smiles up at Parrish.

There is a polygraph paper in the EEG machine, and the

against the side of the tank. Parrish and Rosenberg
come in. Rosenberg helps him clamber out of the tank.

ROSENBERG
(removing the
EEG leads)
I don't like being out of contact
for these long periods of time,
Eddie.

Parrish hands Jessup a hooded terrycloth robe. Jessup
slips into the robe, begins towelling his hair. He
nods at Rosenberg, a strange monkish figure in the
dark room, shrouded in the dark robe, its hood cowled
over his head, only his white, wet eyes visible in the
coped blackness of his face. He seems to be trying
to say something. His jaws move, but nothing comes
out except a rasping kind of GRUNT. His eyes stare
mutely at them. He tries to talk again but can only
produce CLICKING SOUNDS. He sinks slowly to his knees,
his faceless white wet eyes staring in blank shock

out of the black oval formed by the robe's cowl.

ROSENBERG
I think he's in shock.

He turns the light switch on. Light slowly rises.
Parrish pulls the hood of the robe back.

As the LIGHT comes on increasingly strongly, we see 112
Jessup on his knees in the middle of the room, his

robe hanging limply on his white body, his face staring
blankly up, his cheeks and mouth wet with red blood,
smeared where he had towelled his face, looking for

all the world as if he had recently ravened a carcass.

PARRISH
He must've bit his lip.

He towels away some of the blood, then slips out of
his lab coat, strips off his shirt, leans over to the
tank,, wets it in the tank, uses it to clean Jessup's
face. By now, the LIGHT is fully on, and the room is
well lit. Parrish fetches his examining light from
his lad coat, pokes it into Jessup's mouth and up his

nose.

PARRISH
(mutters )
Must've had a seizure, hit his head
or something.

Jessup seems to be coming out of his shock. He is
trying to talk again. All that comes out is a WHISTLE
and a CLICKING SOUND. He reaches out his hand to
Rosenberg tO be helped up. His two friends finally
get him standing. The shock is clearly gone now. His
eyes respond intelligently; in fact, they glisten with
excitement. He is smiling. He heads for the observa-
tion room, indicating that since he can't talk, he
wants to communicate by writing --

INT. THE OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT 113

By the time Parrish and Rosenberg get there, Jessup is
seated on Rosenberg's chair and has scrawled something
in Rosenberg's notebook. Rosenberg leans over to

read the message --

Parrish reaches forward to palpate his neck. Jessup
angrily brushes Parrish's hand away, scrawls a long.

Rosenberg, who carries his stuff around in an old air-

a rubber tourniquet. He sets about taking blood
samples from Jessup's left arm.

PARRISH

Parrish auscultates Jessup's neck, shines his opthal-

mits with little grace and only because he is confined
by Rosenberg drawing blood. He is obviously in con-
siderable inner turmoil. He sits on the chair in his
bulky robe, his legs crossed, one swinging nervously.

He stares horrified at his body. He is wearing only
his pajama trousers, and scmething terrible seems to
be happening to his body. It seems to be swelling

shrivels into a bent little furred arm, much like a
rat's paw. Suddenly, his feet are webbed; a split-
second later, they are furred as well; a split-second
later, they are back to normal. His face is a mask of
pain. He touches his head, feeling the bones of his
skull -- his jaw, the bones just above his eyebrows,
which seem to be moving under his skin, reassembling
into new formations. He suddenly bends forward,
clutching the back of hls neck as if he had been
brutally struck there. His chest surges into massive
musculature and subsides. Cracks appear and suddenly
spread throughout his body. The Med Student stirs,
still trying to cover her nakedness --

He forces himself into a sitting position, his legs
hanging over the side of the bed. He almost falls to
his knees beside the bed. Slowly, carefully, he
makes his way around the bed to the bathroom, all the
while his body crumbling, crackling and buckling, as
if he were made of dry earth, as if seismic forces
were at work within him. He gets himself into the --

tionary images of himself, flickering one after
another, none of the images lasting longer than a
fraction of a second. The images are mostly hominid
and protohuman, Ramapithecine figures, in which he is
no more than three feet tall. Several of the reflec-
tions snow him in the shape of a delicately-fingered,
insect-eating, lemur-like animal, perched in a tree,
clutching a branch, and staring out through enormous
soft eyes.

stare at his naked right arm on the desk. CAMERA PANS

The room, indeed the whole flat -- the bottom floor of
a Cape Cod house on Avon Hill in Cambridge -- is a

wild disarray of packed and unpacked luggage. Cartons,
small crates, valises, carrying bags lay open in every
room, half-emptied; clothing is piled on beds, in

heaps on the floor; books and notebooks, cans of film
and stacks of tape recorder cassettes and reels are
massed in mounds on beds, chairs and tables. Through
the windows, we can see dusk is descending outside. We
might even catch glimpses of the Jessup children on

the front porch. Through all this disarray, Emily
moves following her own private pattern of efficiency,
piling this bunch of things here and carrying that

pile of clothing across the entrance foyer of the house
into the bedrooms where she dumps them on other piles
of clothing. She turns on a lamp in the room.

It has an orange shade, and it casts an orange light. 127
All the while she chats away with Jessup whom we can

see in the kitchen to the rear of the living room,
sitting at the formica-topped table, legs crossed, sip~-
ping a cup of coffee --

EMILY

(as she goes through

all the above)
-- Anyway, don't let anybody tell
you baboons aren't occasionally
carnivorous. I personally observed
two instances of predation which
involved the unmistakeable behavior
of hunters. A pair of baboons
killed young Thomson gazelles and
ate them. There was a rudimentary
communication between the two
baboons that was noticeably
different from the usual baboon
vocalizations. So I've become
fascinated with the work on non=
verbal communication being done
with apes. I've been corresponding
with the Gardners at the University
of Nevada. I may just go out and
spend a couple of weeks there this
summer. I've got nothing else to
do except write up my report.

JESSUP
I don't suppose you recorded any
of those baboon sounds.

EMILY
Yes, of course, I did, why?

She comes into --
INT. THE KITCHEN - DUSK 127A
~-- where she pours herself a cup of coffee --

JESSUP
I'd like very much to hear them.

EMILY
Of course.

She pulls up a chair, joins him at the table.

JESSUP
Mrs. Tully said she'll be here
tomorrow morning at ten-thirty to
help you put everything away.

127A JESSUP (cont'd) 127A
She wanted to know if you wanted
her to come back to work steady,
and I said I was sure you would.

She nods. A silence falls between them. They sip
at their cups. She steals a glance at him.

EMILY
I got a letter from Mason about a
week ago, just before we left
Nairobi. He says that over the
past year you've taken about two
grams of that drug yourself and
that you had a very unusual
instance of genetic regression
about three months ago, which he
thinks was an incipient neoplastic
process, and that you've probably
got leukemia or lymphoma. He's
been trying to get you into the
hospital for a complete workup,
but you refuse to go. He's worried
stiff that you're cracking up. He
thinks you're behaving very
strangely, and he begged me to
talk to you about this when I
got back.

JESSUP
Mason is pathologically incapable
of keeping his mouth shut about

anything.
EMILY
He's worried about you.
JESSUP

He's also a stupid, starched,
doctrinaire idiot.

EMILY
Mason is a first~rate doctor.

JESSUP
It's not leukemia or any other
kind of cancer!

He stands, flushed with fury, his hands visibly trem-
bling with the effort of controlling his mounting rage.

JESSUP
I let him do a liver-spleen scan
on me and a CAT scan. I've been
probed, scoped and palpated!

JESSUP (cont'd) 127A
Parrish has had a mirror down my
throat or up my ass every half
hour for three months! And there
is no evidence, no suggestion
whatsoever of cancer!

She says nothing; he strides off into the living room
and is as suddenly back.

JESSUP
What else did he write you? What
else did he tell you about that
genetic regression I went through
three months ago?

She says nothing for fear of provoking another outburst.
Jessup disappears into the living room. After a moment ,
she stands, goes to the doorway.

ACROSS Emily looking into the living room where Jessup
is hunched over by the porch window, trying to read the
labels on a stack of audio cassettes by the fading
daylight.

JESSUP
Which of these has the baboon
vocalizations on them? I'd like
to hear them.

EMILY
Why?

JESSUP

(smiles briefly)
Did Mason write you that during
that incident of regression I went
through, I had an aphasic experience
for about four hours? The only
sounds I could get out were clicks
and grunts. I've got a gut hunch
they're very much like the baboon
vocalizations you have on your
tapes.

EMILY
Mason says that you took blood tests,
and the lab report showed some
characteristics of simian blood
group systems.

JESSUP
They also picked up antigens,
specific to man.

EMILY
I'd like to see that data.

JESSUP
We also took a buccal smear. The
chromosomal count was forty-eight --

EMILY
Are you serious?

JESSUP
And the structure of the karyotype
was also non-human.

They stand, staring at each other across the room.
Three year old Margaret straggles into the room and
wraps herself around her father's knees. Jessup
fondles the tow head absently.
ALTERED STATES - Rev. 3/5/79

127B JESSUP

Look, Emily, an incomprehensible
instance of regression has occurred,
literal, physical regression:
muscles, bones, chromosomes and genes.
We have a small body of evidence
that cannot be explained away as
leukemia or lymphoma. There was
a transformation of piological
structures, that's clear. Beyond
that, all we've got is a
singularity, a physical event
that is out of context of all
known theory.

(picks his daughter

up, clutches her to

him, whispers into

her hair)
Everybody thinks your father's going
nuts --

(strides around the

room, clutching the

ehild, talking in

bursts like a man

out of breath)
I mean, for God's sake, the thing
to do is for me to get back in
that isolation tank and try it
again! Let's see if it happens
again! I mean, none of us really
believes it happened! After three
months, I'm beginning to wonder if
it ever happened myself! But, oh
no! They won't go back in the
tank! Mason's taken over the
whole project! He's got Arthur
up in his lab every day,
fractionating rats' brains! What
the hell am I supposed to do while
they're fractionating rats! brains!
I am convinced the regression was
triggered by an act of consciousness!
While I was in the tank, I entered
another consciousness! I became
another self! A more primitive
self! And the drug, in some way,
triggered the externalization of
that other, more primitive self!

127B His daughter begins to cry. 127B

EMILY
Put her down, Eddie. You're
frightening her.

Jessup gently restores the girl to the floor. Emily
picks up the frightened child. When she looks up to
her husband, he is sitting on the soft chair under the
lamp, his eyes closed, his face masklike.

JESSUP
At least, look at my data.

EMILY
Of course. Maybe tomorrow afternoon.
Would tomorrow afternoon be all

right?

JESSUP
Don't patronize me.

EMILY
I'm not --

JESSUP

(stands, shouting)
It's just possible I'm not mad, you
know! I'm asking you to make a
small quantum jump with me! To
accept one deviant concept -~ that
our other states of consciousness
are as real as our waking state
and that that reality can be
externalized!

EMILY
You're screaming.

JESSUP

I know! But I've been getting this
patronizing shit from Arthur and
Mason for three months now, and I'm
sick of it. We've got millions of
years stored away in that computer
bank we call our minds! We've got
trillions of dormant genes in us,
our whole evolutionary past!
Perhaps I've tapped into that!
For God's sake, all I'm saying is
I want to get back to that tank
and repeat the experiment! The
most elementary laboratory behavior!
Repeat the experiment! Confirm it!
I would like other responsible
scientists with me when I do it!

He sits again, crosses his legs, folds his hands in
his lap. The orange light of the lamp slashes across
his face.

I've got all the tapes, notes and
everything at my place. What time

beg. He is wearing the jacket, sweater and shapeless
chinos he was wearing in the previous scenes and is
carrying Rosenberg's airline bag. He turns on a
water valve. Water RUMBLES into the tank. He checks
the thermostat, opens the airline bag, extracts a jar
of magnesium sulfate, pours it into the gathering
spume at the bottom of the tank. He strips off his
jacket and sweater, keeps checking the water level

in the tank. He takes a Mason jar of clear liquid out
of the airline bag, measures off 4 ec of the liquid
into a syringe, squirts that into a beaker. He drains
the beaker in one gulp, walks to a shadowy corner of

perhaps a bit sloping in the shoulders, definable human
features except for a massive projecting ridge of bone

open. Interested, Ortega goes into --

He looks through the one-way window into the tank room
which is barely lit, just enough light to make out
that sinister coffin-like uncovered tank. Ortega
shrugs, starts to go back into the corridor, opens

the corriaor door, changes his mind, turns and opens
the door to the tank room. He is immediately knocked
against the wall by a hurtling, ferocious little
animal, which, in his confusion, Ortega takes to be

a dog; at least, he mutters imprecations in Spanish

as to who the hell is keeping a fucking dog down here.

The animal has gotten out the corridor door just 149
before it closes. Ortega yoes back out into --

INT. B BUILDING CORRIDOR - NIGHT 150

What he sees now about fifteen yards down the corridor
is an apelike creature, covered with a fine fur, that
is, however, unmistakably human. It stands upright.

Its eyes are small and red, but not deep-socketed like
an ape's, and seem to have a human intelligence in them.
The creature is no bigger than Ortega's own nine-

year old son, but it is fierce-looking and is making a
threatening, savage, rumbling NOISE, curling its lip
and baring its teeth which are yellow, even, and very
human in appearance. Ortega is getting a little scared.
He reaches for his janitor's broom and begins to un-
screw the long handle --

ORTEGA
(calling to a col-
league hopefully
nearby)
Hey, Jameson! Hey, Jameson, are
you still there? Come here!

His voice echoes in the empty basement corridors.

There is no response. Holding the broom pole, he takes
a step toward the strange animal, which watches him
carefully.

ORTEGA
Hey, Jameson, in the name of God,
come over here and see this!
(brandishes his pole
at the creature)
Es mejor que salgas de aqui antes
que cometa una locura!

The creature's face suddenly flares with rage. It
raises both furred fists and screams in fury. Ortega
turns and bolts back up the corridor to the first
corridor that debouches to the left and leads to D
Building --

INT, CONNECTING CORRIDOR TO D BUILDING = NIGHT 151

Ortega comes tearing halfway down to a door marked
Security Office. Behind him, he can hear enraged
SCREECHES bouncing off the walls. He knocks on the
door of the Security Office, looks back up the connect-
ing corridor, clutching his broomstick. The corridor
is empty but still echoing. The door opens, and the
bulky finure of Sergeant GEORGE OBISPO, a tall, uni-
formed man, appears.

From the distant bowels of B Building, the echoing
SHRIEK of rage sounds again, caroming off the walls
of the empty corridors.

OBISPO

Carajo.

He goes striding up the corridor, unbuckling his night-
stick. Ortega follows, holding nis broom pole. Half-
way down, they both pull up short because about twenty-
five yards in front of tnem, where their corridor is
erossed by the B Building corridor, the strange little
creature suddenly lopes into view, silhouetted in the
diffused yellow light. It rewards the two men a
moment, then bursts into a shrill BARK or SNARL,
clearly signifying frustration with its situation.

It moves off witn startling quickness. Obispo and
Ortega break into a trot to get to ==

Empty. This area is poorly lighted. One of the over-
head neon tubes is blown. This corridor also serves
as a sometime storage area. A corrugated metal door
leads to the Longwood Street loading platform on the
left side. Several huge empty cardboard cartons stand
against this door. The area is also an auxiliary
changing room for the students, and both walls are
lined with green and gray lockers. About sixty yards

windows in the upper halves,

Ortega tugs at the door, which is heavy and stuck. It
takes all of Ortega's strength to get it open.

He could never open this door.

Nevertheless, he leans into the stairwell and looks up
to the street level and down to the sub-basement level.
Behind him, Sergeant Obisno has put his walkie-talkie
back into its case, and, holding his club, moves slowly
into the shadows between the enfilade of lockers,
poking each locker with his club. CAMERA DOLLIES with

Security Officers THOMAS and MINGUS breaking into a
run as they hear Obispots SCREAMS. Thomas is pulling
out his chain of keys as he runs, tries to unlock the
doors. It is difficult for them to tell what is going
on on the other side of the doors because the wire-
reinforced windows deform the view.

THEIR POV through the windows -- a confused flux of 157
shapes on the floor. We hear the creature's high-
pitched SCREAM and Obispo's BELLOWS of pain. Suddenly,
the rectangular window in one of the doors is filled

with a savage, hairy face, made even more horrible by

the deforming quality of the glass.

Thomas and ilingus startle back from the door. Mingus 158
starts pulling at his gun holster. Thomas finally

gets the door open. The two guards fling themselves

into the other side of the corridor. Obispo is on

Three wild DOGS slink alons the black streets of this

the street. The dogs barely notice, slink on, wet,
dangerous. scruffy. They pad softly down the street
past the row of store fronts. After they have gone
about thirty yards, almost disappearing into the dark-
ness of the night, a form slips out of one of the
recessed store fronts and goes trotting along after
the dogs. It is the creature last seen clubbing
Sergeant Obispo.

A burn-out area. An occasional six story tenement 161

with smashed, gaping black windows. One side of this
street has been demolisied to rubble and scree. The
three dogs pick and slink their way across this open
expanse. Some thirty yards behind them comes Jessup,
loping along, pausing to pick up a piece of jagged
brick. A strange, savage surreal scene in the derelict
heart of the city, three wild dogs and a small apelike
ereature, slinking through the black, abandoned streets
hunting for prey.

EXT. ROXBURY - BLUE HILL STREET - FRANKLIN PARK ZOO 162

On the west side of the street, the high iron fence of
the Franklin Park Zoo; on the other side of the street,
a row of small apartment houses. Jessup stands hold-
ing his club and his piece of brick. He is standing
on the zoo side of the street. Behind him, on the

. other side of the fence, he hears the TRILLS and CROAKS

of birds. The dogs on the other side of the street
are marauding some garbage cans and plastic garbare
bags and sniffing up alleys and down basement steps,
looking for rats.

There is suddenly a small, snarling flurry among the
dogs as they threaten each other over something they
have found. It's over in a few seconds. A car goes
by, headlights, windshield wiper whisking back and
forth, and is gone. The dogs cone slinking across the
street to the zoo side, filthy, skulking animals.
Jessup watches them, not moving a muscle, tense, alert.
They are some twenty yards to the south of him, poking
about at the foot of the zoo's fence, looking for a
hole. One of them suddenly wheels toward Jessup, its
yellow eyes wide and its lin drawn back, exposing

the teeth. The other dogs snarl softly, turn their
heads to regard the curious little apelike figure.

With a shrill SHRIEK, Jessup dashes a few steps at 162
the dogs, brandishing his stick and stone. The dogs
scatter, slink back, keeping their distance. Jessup's
shriek rouses the birds in the zoo. There is a sudden
FLUTTERING of distant wings and birds CALLING danger

to their fellows.

The lead dog, a MONGREL MASTIFF with white markings
on its brow, growls softly, pads into the street,
moving up on Jessup's flank. Jessup watches him
warily, makes a threatening SNARL of his own. The
mongrel attacks, leaping for Jessup's throat. Jessup
batters at the red-tongued maw of the dog's throat.
The other two dogs lunge in. Jessup wheels on them,
SHRIEKING with fury, smashing at them with his club
and piece of brick. There is a SCREECHING of tires,
and a car, headlights blazing, comes wheeling around
the corner, dispersing the dogs and interrupting the
feral little battle. The car disappears up the
street.

A moment of silence, and then the dogs come slinking
back to continue the battle. But the apelike creature
is gone. They spot him soon enough; he is perched,
Squatting on the stonework that forms the top of the
zoo fence, and, apelike, taunts the dogs with
CACKLING. He tires of this after a few moments and
then climbs down the fence on the zoo side with
agility.

the street lights of Blue Hill Street allows Jessup

to see bushes and trees. It is familiar terrain; he

GRUNTS with pleasure.

He can see a low wattled fence and grass receding un-
ward into blackness and silence. The zoo is asleep,
hushed. There seems to be a RED GLOW on the crest of
the slope, and Jessup stands stock-still, listening,
for he thinks he has just heard the distant BURR of a
crane. He shuffles forward through the grass, finds
himself on one of the wallkways that wind through the
park. He is puzzled by the hard feel beneath his
feet, but he follows the path for a few moments. He
sees a small body of water (the wild fowl pond),
glistening blackly in the night. He stands, waits,
senses. The air hangs heavy and fetid with the smell
of animals, silent with the massive sensation of
sleep.

He moves further along, cutting between trees and
bushes. He is suddenly in an open area, startled

by the abrupt rearing up of a stone building, faintly
visible only by the relative lightness in color of
the stone.
163
thru
166

85.

He moves on. He sees the RED GLOW again, off to his 163
right. He slips softly in that direction. What he thru
comes to see are the night lights of a building 166
which glows red because of the tinting of the

windows and the glass of the doors (the small mammals
building). He slowly approaches this long low stone
pbuilding, rising in a soft, red haze out of the night.

He peers into the interior --

His POV. A long empty hall bathed in a soft red light
that shows rows of cages on each side. In the cages
are mice, porcupines, slotns and shrews, curled up in
balls of sleep with an occasional movement here and
there as one of the small animals slithers across its
cage to its watering trough. It is all incompre-
hensible to Jessup; he is quickly bored.

EXT. THE ZOO ~ ANOTHER SECTION - NIGHT

Jessup making his way around large empty round cages
with thick iron bars (the great apes building), down
macadam paths lined with protective iron railings.

He hears the croaking BURR of a crane, much closer
now. He stops, freezes, waits, listens. To his left,
a large stone outcropping, barely discernible;
directly ahead, a large, round, iron-fenced area (the
giraffe cages). On his right, suddenly, behind the
fence of wooden wattles, he senses movement, and then
a CROWNED CRANE moves stiffly into nis vision, nearly
invisible in the darkness, lit sufficiently by the

red reflections of the building behind it to be recog-
nized by the glistening red and white spots on its
face and the stiff, large, straw-colored topknot of
feathers on its head. It stands, staring blankly

out of its button eyes, then turns and disappears

into the darkness. Jessup stands unmoving, holding
his club and bit of prick. He moves softly to the

low wooden fence and peers into the darkness trying to
see the crane again, but it's gone. He moves on.

EXT, THE ZOO - THE AFRICAN PLAINS - NIGHT

Jessup stands in front of what seems to be a four~foot
hedgerow but which actually disguises a wooden fence
that encloses this section of the park. It is almost
impenetrably dark, but he can hear SOUNDS -- the sounds
of the East African grasslands, the movements of
animals, the sudden, startled flurry of veering herds.
He forces nis way through the bramble of the hedgerow,
crawls between the horizontal poles of the fence, finds
himself on the edge of a shallow moat, about four feet
deep and ten feet wide. Now there is some spill of
STREETLIGHTS from the Seaver Street side of the park,
so that Jessup can make out that he is on high ground,
and a tract of savanna stretches out before him, dark
and silent.
163
thru
166

86.

Far down at the bottom of the slope, he can see a 163
waterhole. On his right, a slight slope of sparse thru
woodland and a sleeping group of blesboks. He 166

grunts with pleasure.

He lets himself down into the moat, which is as high
as he is tall. It is utterly black in here. He walks
along the moat a number of yards till he finds an
overhanging limb by which he pulls himself up onto

the other side. He is on a small stone outcrop. His
appearance startles a herd of perhaps forty mouflon
that are huddled for the night near the wooden pali-
sade of their paddock. The whole herd of sheep

skew madly out into the open grass. Jessup stands
Stock still, holding his club and broken bit of brick,
waiting for his presence to become part of this world.
Silence. On his left, the waterhole, and what seems
to be a single hartebeest humped forward, lapping
quietly at the water,

Jessup moves silently through the wet grass, heading
for the end of the waterhole furthest from the harte-
beest. He pauses at the edge of the waterhole, trying
to sense the presence of predators. The hartebeest
raises its head, watches him, ready to bolt. Jessup
gets down on his knees, bends forward and begins to
lap the water. After a moment, the hartebeest returns
to its own drinking. For a moment, we watch the two
animals, sharing the waterhole, each drinking silently,
warily.

EXT. THE 200 ~ THE AFRICAN PLAINS - NIGHT

Jessup, standing on the dark slope, watching the herd
of mouflon, huddled in a sparse little grove of trees,
about twenty yards off, edgy, trembling even as they
sleep, a skittish few on the periphery of the flock,
flicking here and there like butterflies. The zoo
sleeps.

Nothing moves anywhere. The air is heavy and wet.

He waits. A flicker of movement in the sheep herd.

A lamb leans and bounds this way and that, rejoins the
herd. Abruptly, three sneep leap, run, whirl,
fluttering shadows of movement. Silence. Jessup
waits. He holds his club and his bit of brick in one
hand. In his other hand are two round stones which he
suddenly pitches into the trees where the herd lies.
With the first rustle of leaves, the herd explodes
dementedly, racing, leaping, scattering. Half a dozen
leap and skitter wildly past Jessup. He is after them
with a SHRIEK, driving their agitated mad shadows
before nim, past the waterhole, straight for the moat.
At the lip of the moat, all but one veers and shoots
off into darkness. The one tries to leap the chasm.

It falls in a heap to the bottom of the moat, > 163
crippled. Jessup jumps into the moat and with one thru
stroke of his club smashes in the animal!s skull. 166

EXT. THE Z00 - THE MOAT

Jessup scrapes away at the sheep's hide with his jagged
chip of brick, stripping a good-sized piece off the
sheep's haunch. He stops, pauses, looks up, senses
danger. He hears a low GROWL not too far away. He
stands, picks up his kill by a leg and moves softly,
quickly up the wide, dark moat. He finds an over-
hanging branch. He puts the sheep carcass on the

lip of the moat and hauls himself up beside it. He
picks up his club and brick, stands, checks the ter-
rain. Nothing. He squats down, raises the carcass

_to his face, clamps his teeth into the hot, wet,

bloody flesh. He twists his head back and forth,
wrenching the gobbet of flesh free, and chews at it.
He looks up again sensing danger.

The three dogs, led by the mastiff with the white mark-
ings, are moving up the slope from the waterhole,

lumps of black movement, in the black grass. They halt
a few yards from him, moving around, GROWLING.

Jessup makes a threatening NOISE of his own,

brandishes his club. They keep their distance.

CAMERA PULLS BACK just enough so that we get the image
of Jessup, squatting in the wet grass, eating the

sheep in the night with a great, sullen satisfaction,
occasionally warding off the snarling dogs with a
snarl of his own, a primal animal at one with his
elemental world.

EXT. THE ZOO ~ 2:00 A.li. - NIGHT ~ CLEAR - MOON 167

A jeep crawling along the pathways in the night, park-
ing lights only. A zoo SECURITY GUARD on night duty.
He spots some movement on the African Plains. He
stops the jeep, lets it idle, gets out, peers over the
Rotterdam (wire) fence that encloses the area on this
side.

ACROSS the Guard looking up the slope. There is
certainly something going on. The rain is long over.
The moon is out. The activity up on the slope looks
like three dogs ravening at something.

The Guard up on the slope ciimbs over the fence and
starts up the slope, drawing his revolver. The dogs
see him and scatter. He moves on further to see what
they were ravening at. It is the remeins of the
mouflon. The Guard looks around to see if the dogs
are still skulking around: they are gone.

The Cuard's eye is caught by a WHITE BLUR in the dark 167
erass under a tree about twenty yards away. He cocks

his gun, moves cautiously forward. It is a naked

man. He continues forward. It is Jessup. He is
sleeping. His chest rises and falls evenly. There is

a beatific smile on his face.

INT, THE FRANKLIN PARK PRECINCT STATION SQUAD ROOM 168

Typical battered old police station house. A COP
brings Jessup out of the bowels of the building,
dressed and carrying an empty overnight bag which he
hands to Emily who, with Parrish, has been anxiously
waiting for him -~

INT. PARRISH'S CAR - £N ROUT - NIGHT 170

Emily steals an anxious glance at her husband, who is
sitting between her and Parrish. He seems to be ina
state of shock, distracted, oddly placid, lobotomized,
staring through the windshield, almost unaware of her
or Parrish.

EMILY .
What were you doing in the tank
room?
(he doesn't seem
to hear her)
Do you remember anything at all
about last night?

Ee stares at her blankly.

JESSUP
(after a moment)
I remember large fragments of what
happened, but not all of it.
You'll have to be patient with me.

He turns back to stare out the windshield again.

EMILY .
I've had Mason looking all over a
Boston for you all night. .

She lets her head sink onto his chest and cries.

JESSUP

her hair)
It's okay, I'm alright ~-

INT. JESSUP'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - NIGHT 171

Emily sitting at the kitchen table, sipping coffee and
nibbling at cookies from a pox. She looks up as
Jessup enters, swathed in a towel-robe, patting him
self dry. He makes himself a cup of instant coffee.
He seems in a very good mood, excited, exhilarated.

JESSUP

(affably)
I suppose getting a call from the
police at three o'clock in the
morning to the effect your husband
has been found sleeping naked in
the city zoo might have caused
you some concern,

figured I finally flipped out
altogether.

He sits down across from her and would say something,
but he begins to laugh, a full, cpen, exuberant
laugh. After a moment, he wipes his eyes.

JESSUP
I'm sorry, Emily, forgive me. I
know what a harrowing day I've
caused you. I'm sure you've been
sitting here all this time while
trying to figure how to get me to
a psychiatrist.

EMILY
As a matter of fact, I have.

JESSUP
I don't know how you've put up with
me all these years.

EMILY
I loved you.

He stands, cries out in exultation --

JESSUP
Oh, my God, Emily! TI don't know
how to tell you this! I really
don't! Bear with me, Emily! The
implications are staggering!

He strides off into the living room. She follows to

very well.

(he perches on the

arm of the over-

stuffed chair)
On a. strictly physiological level,
I suspect we achieved an observable
momentum at enough nuclear locations
to alter the actual form. The drug
probably affects the bonding.

He is up again, excited, moving around the room in a
gathering frenzy of creativity. -

JESSUP
But even if we could establish a
biochemical setting for this, so
what? Suppose we get some cells,
erack them open, get some assays.
Okay, so we get all kinds of whacked
out polyribosomal profiles.
Pantastic enzymatic activity. I'm
making proteinat anunbelievable
pace. I mean, let's face it! This
whole thing is biologically
impossible! We're not just talking
about one cell or even a colony of
cells going wild. We're talking
about a massive mutation of my
entire biological system, a process
that took millions of years to
evolve reversing itself in a matter
of hours if not moments! Some
extraordinary transfer of energy
has occurred. ‘We may be into some
kind of exotic relativistic physics
here in which consciousness snapped
me into some new sharp attribute.
Don't we have a physicist in our
eircle of friends? I'd like to
bounce this off a quantum guy.
Because, you see, Emily, what I
think happened is I somenow got
into a quantum state where there
is no matter, only the potential
of matter. It makes sense,
doesn't it. Some original and
universal state of energy potential.
I somehow tapped inte that original
consciousness of pure potential.
My God, what an implacably beautiful

mutters:

JESSUP

It must be true. Anything that

beautiful must be true.
(doesn't even know
she's in the room
any more)

He sighs as if in sexual consummation and sinks back
into the embrace of the soft chair.

EMILY
You still haven't told me what
happened tonight.

He sprawls in the soft chair, seems almost to be
asleep.

JESSUP
(murmurs )

After I left you this afternoon,

I went to the isolation tank room,
took two hundred milligrams of the
stuff, got into the tank, and at
some point during the evening, I
transformed my matter into some
form of early human life.

EMILY
(nervous )
What the hell do you mean you
transformed your matter?

JESSUP
I followed a pack of wild dogs to
the zoo. That's how I got there.
In the zoo, I hunted down, killed
and ate a small sheep. I was
utterly primal. I consisted of
nothing more than the will to
survive, to live through the
night, to eat, to drink, to sleep.
It was the most supremely
satisfying time of my life.

The doorbell RINGS.

EMILY
That must be Mason.

She sits, frightened by the madness she has just heard.
The doorbell RINGS again. Emily stands, starts for
the door.

Parrish booms into the room, carrying Jessup's cloth-
ing over his arm.

: PARRISH
Man! You don't know the trouble
I had getting these clothes! I
had to go to the security office
for them! They want you to call
them right now. There was some
Kind of ape in your isolation tank
room tonight, do you know anything
about that? This ape almost killed
a security guard. You didn't
bring an ape down to the tank room
tonight, did you? Your watch and
stuff are in the jacket pocket.
(dumps the clothing
on a chair, senses
something is wrong)
Is everything all right? Is he
okay?

EMILY

(moving to the

kitchen)
If he's okay, the rest of us are in
a lot of trouble.

(pauses in the

doorway )
Tell Mason what you've been telling
me. I'd like to hear Mason's views
on all this.

JESSUP
I think Mason's views will be
predictable.

Pleasant Sunday afternoon in April. Emily, Parrish,
the Rosenbergs lounging on the stoop and perch.
Sylvia Rosenberg is nursing an infant. The Jessup
kids and the Rosenberg ooys are occasionally seen
in b.g. Parrish's predictable views are being ex-
pounded by him at the moment --

PARRISH (cont'd)
... Yan around the streets of Boston
naked and wound up sleeping in the
zoo. This is hardly the first
instance of drug-induced delirium
any of us have heard of.

EMILY
What worries me is he actually
believes his hallucination. I mean,
he actually thinks he turned into
an apeman. He can't tell
hallucination from reality any
more.

PARRISH
As for that strange ape they found
in the tank room that night, I'm
sure it'll turn out to be some
local kid who broke in to steal
some drugs, or something like that.

EMILY
I called him yesterday morning and
last night, and I spoke to him this
morning again. He sounds absolutely
fine. He's going over to M.I.T.
to brainstorm with some physicists
on Wednesday. I told him he ought
to spend some time with the kids.
He hasn't seen them in a year,
they've been asking for him. This
has got to be the most hideous
weekend I ever lived. I'm still
not unpacked. My husband has had
a breakdown, and do you know the
only thing I can think about right
now is I've got to place the kids
in a school tomorrow morning?

PARRISH
And now he wants to do it again,
and he wants us to watch him.

EMILY
For God's sake, you're not going
to let him do it again.

The point is unarguable.

INT. JESSUP'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY 175

Emily on the sofa, reaching up to turn the standing
lamp on. It's still daylight outside, but the room

is getting dark for reading. Emily is reading a sheaf
of papers -- the blood analysis reports from the
Goodman labs. Jessup's notebooks, X-rays and stacks
of audio cassettes are stacked on the coffee table in
front of her. There is a tape playing now, as she
studies the Goodman lab report. It is the tape of
Jessup's aphasic experience -=

We can see now that Emily is not actually reading, that
her entire interest has been Caught by the theatri-
cality of the tape --

Jessup's voice breaks into a CROAK and some CLICKING
NOISES, then a HOWL. Emily lets the tape run just
long enough to know there's nothing more. She quickly
rewinds and plays the GRUNTS and CLICKING SOUNDS and
HOWL again. She rewinds again, plays it back again,
listens with the most intense interest --

INT. A McDONALD'S RESTAURANT - NIGHT - 9:30 P.M. 176

The Jessuos, a typical American family in a large
dining room of typical American families. ‘It's late;
Emily and Jessup are down to their coffee, and
Margaret is cranky and whining and Jessup has to hold
her. He is talking, and Emily is fascinated --

JESSUP
Physicists see the whole tning in
terms of particles and energy states.
You get situations in particle
physics, where you have something
in one state and then suddenly
you'll find it appearing in another
state. It has apparently zipped
through a forbidden region between
the states, What I may have done
is reduce my uncertainty in energy
to zero or near enough to zero so
that the time available to me to
tunnel through had been infinite.

In b.g., Grace, who has been roaming around the
restaurant, falls and cries. Jessup rises and gets
her, talking as he does -~

JESSUP

Where I differ from the physicists
is they conceive of consciousness
as a particular force exerted by a
particular person. I see it as a
cosmic, perhaps the cosmic force.
Our universe expToded into being
some twenty billion years ago, a
fantastic explosion of hydrogen,
so it all began with an actual act
of creation. What did the creating?

JESSUP (cont'd) 176
That original creative force is
what I call consciousness. You can
call it God if you like, but there's
a difference. Consciousness is
not a noumenal process; it's
phenomenological, it can be reached,
tapped, manipulated. Lord knows,
I believe I tapped into it.

: EMILY
I think I better get the kids home.

She moves about getting the sleepy kids jacketed and
standing. Jessup watches her movements -~ the saucy
ass, the long legs, her natural physical sensuality.

JESSUP
I'd like to go home with you tonight,
would that be all right with you?

She pauses, turns, smiles at hin.

EMILY
Do you know, I think that's exactly
what you said to me the first night
we met, do you remember? In Arthur
and Sylvia's apartment back in New
York?

JESSUP
Yes, and you said we'd have to make
do with the couch. The couch is
still okay with me.

I don't know how even to put this

last Friday night was not just a
hallucinatory experience. I've
got this gut feeling something
phenomenological did actually
nappen, that there was some kind
of genetic transformation. I
don't know why I think that in

happened, Emily.

They move to the threshold of the living room, where
they pause again in the half-shadow.

EMILY
I'm suggesting that you put the
experiment off until we understand
a little more in order to minimize
the risk.

JESSUP
There is no way we can understand
this before the event. We can only
work back from the event itself.

EMILY
You may be causing yourself
irreversible genetic damage.

genetics. We're beyond mass and
matter here, beyond even energy.
What we're back to is the first

thought.

All our evidence indicates nothing
irreversible is going to happen.
None of my experiences have lasted
longer than four hours, and I have
always reconstituted completely.

A defittingly Gothic night. Thunder RUMBLES. Rain
lashes through the streets. Lightning bleaches the
SCENE. Emily comes out of her house, raincoated and
umbrellaed, braves her way to her car.

Emily comes in through the exit door at the end of the
corridor, raincoated and shaking her umbrella out.

INT. CORRIDOR TO THE TANK ROOM - NIGHT 183A

She heads up the corridor to the tank room. There is
considerable traffic of hospital personnel on this
rainy night, all going about their individual bus-
inesses. Emily turns into -~

where Rosenberg is standing’ beside an examining table
with an attached IV stand; Rosenberg is loading up the
IV. On the examining table, there are a marrow tray,
a biopsy tray, a prep kit, a 35 mm Nikon and a video-
tape setup, camera and console. Also two gooseneck
standing lamps. Through the window we can see Parrish
standing by the isolation tank talking to Jessup who
is strippins off his shirt. He smiles at her. She
responds witn a nervous smile of her own.

Neither Rosenberg nor Parrish seem aware of this or
of the SCREAM: but Emily is staring blindly ahead
seeing and hearing it all. The SCREAM abruptly stops.

Suddenly, over the speaker on the top shelf, we hear
a rasping kind of GRUiiT and a series of CLICKING

we are looking down into the sleeping mask of a some~-
what gorilla-like face, its skin a black and shining
hide. There is almost no brow, the close-cropped
scalp hair coming down almost to the heavy simian
ridge that bulges sligntly across the brow. The
facial fur is finer than that found on apes and does
not entirely cover the ears. The lower part of the
face is prognathic, the lips extended and open, re-
vealing strong yellow but very human teeth. The eyes,
even closed, are also more human then apelike, larger
and not sunken into deep sockets. The neck, shoulders
and that part of the chest that can be seen are
covered with a fine, short fur.

Then suddenly the BLUE light sweeps through the tank 202
in SHOCK WAVES, and the four walls of the tank fly &
apart, as if a nuclear blast had been detonated in- 203
side of it. Both Parrish and Rosenberg are flung

back against the walls. The water in the tank GEYSERS

up to the ceiling in a SCREAMING MUSHROOM CLOUD,

CRASHING with a CLAP as loud as thunder, and then

floods through the room to ankle depth. INFRA-RED

WAVES of light sweep back and forth across the room,
accumulating. in intensity to ORANGES and YELLOWS that
seem hotter than the sun, and the whole of the tank

room FLARES molten with heat.

INT. THE OBSERVATION ROO!i - NIGHT 204

Emily stands stunned to stupefaction, staring into the
tank room. We see what she sees --

Where the tank had been is a pulsating MASS of 205
WHITE SUBSTANCE, rising out of the thin layer of thru
BOILING WATER, An enormous gouge has been ripped 210
out of the front of this grotesque, unformed white

thing, showing a section of skeletal structure.

Emily SCREAMS, beside herself with terror. SCREAMING,

she lunges at the door that separates her from the

tank room, and SCREAMING, she wrenches it open and

plunges into --

INT. THE TANK ROOM - NIGHT

-- splashing ankle deep into the room to stop and ~=
like Rosenberg and Parrish pressed against the far
wall -- gape stupefied at what is going on in the
middle of the room.

The MASS of SUBSTANCE seems to be trying to assume a
form. Stumps of arms and leas, misshapen and mis-
placed, BULGE out of the mess and RECEDE back into
it. The substance itself changes color, begins to
BUBBLE and BOIL as if cooked by an interior fire.

It begins to SCREAM a PIERCING and AGONZIED SCREAM.

Emily's hysterical immobility is ended by this SCREAM.
She splashes towards her husband. The room has
become COSMIC BLACK, a BLACKNESS that PULSES with
WAVES of force, SHUDDERING BANDS of RADIATION. The
room DRONES with ENERGY. The space RESONATES and
RIPPLES. Jessup's form, still recognizably human,
seems to be caught in a PINCH of ENERGY WAVES and
temperature differences, twisting and swirling

around him, changing his coloration from LUMINOUS
WHITE to FOGGY INFRA-RED to the BURNING RED of ultra-
violet radiation to blurred CHIARCSCURO BLACKS and
GRAYS of the quality of x-rays.

His form appears to be DISSOLVING in SHIMMERING 205
VIBRATIONS into the pulsating waves of energy thru
penetraing him. Suddenly, nis body SWELLS until it 210
DISTENDS into a sphere of gas, a shocking YELLOW GAS
turning RED, and, as suddenly, collapsing in under

the crushing weight of its own gravity. His bowels

erupt into flames, rekindling the maniacal CARNAGE

of COLORS, now so phenomenally hot he is BLINDING

WHITE. He begins to SCREAM again in hideous terror,
sinking to his knees as if he were melting, imploding

as if he were being sucked into a black hole of his own,

Emily flings herself upon this SHUDDERING, increas-
ingly SHAPELESS anti-matter of her husband and embraces
him. Not fifteen seconds have elapsed since the first
explosion.

In Emily's arms, Jessup's form THROBS and CRACKS and
RESONATES, and he SCREAMS his anguished primal SHRIEK
again. His eyes stare blindly out on some existential
and unspeakable horror. Then, the fluctuating ex-
tensions of matter that still retain the barely dis-
tinguishable shape of arms flow out and unfold them-
selves around his wife, and they kneel together on
the flooded floor of the room, two terrified figures
alone in the dense black spaceless DRONE of energy,
elutching each other against the horror of human
origins.

Abruptly, the demented throbbing HUM of entropic
forces stons. The COSMIC BLACK recedes as if it had
been snatched up. Emily holds pressed against her
the now entirely reconstituted naked form of her
husband. They remain locked in their desperate
embrace amid the wreckage of the tank room. Fragments
of the wooden tank are everywhere, the smaller pieces
floating listlessly in the several inches of water
that covers the floor. Jessup is no longer screaming.
There is NO SOUND at ali; the silence is palpable.
Emily locks down at the ashen face resting on her
breast; he is breathing but manifestly in coma. She
turns her own harrowed face to where Rosenberg and
Parrish are slowly lumbering to their feet, mutely
asking them for help. Parrish sloshes over to her.

He disengaszes Jessup's limp form from his wife's
embrace and carries it to the door.

Obviously, she's net; she is suddenly racked by a

hand on her back; and she starts to her feet like a

Reality to Eddie is only that
which is changeless, immutably
constant. What happened to him

of love. That was consummation.
He finally got it off with God.
He finally embraced the Absolute,
was finally ravished by Truth.
And it fucking near destroyed him!

again, yielding

to the hysteria)

had before. She closes the door, the room darkening.
She moves silently around the bed to the window, raises
the shade and looks out into the sleeping dark backyards
of the houses on the next street. After a moment, she
turns to look at her husband.

ACROSS Emily to Jessup on the bed. He has turned his
head on the gray-shadowed pillow, his eyes are open,

The shade on the window is still up, and the first gray
passionless light of day filters into the room.

On the bed, Jessup awakens; his eyes open, and he lies
there letting the sanity of daylight enter into him.
The door to the living room is open, but the apartment
is utterly still, the stiliness of sleep. He sits up
slowly, moves his legs over the side of the bed and
stands. He seems okay. He is barefooted, wearing
the T-shirt and jeans he had slept in. He moves to
the door to the living room --

ACROSS Jessup from the doorway, looking into the 226
living room. Rosenberg and Parrish are obviously thru
gone. His wife lies sleeping on the couch, one 223

long white leg protruding from under a twist of
blanket which is half on the floor along with a
small puddle of her clothing, her blouse, jeans and
sneakers. The blinds are drawn and she seems very

wall opposite her and sinks down into it and watches her.

She turns in her sleep, and what little part of the
blanket that had covered her slips down onto the floor.
She curls up into herself, feeling the sudden chill of
her nakedness, even in her sleep. He gets up, crosses
the room, picks up the blanket and covers her again,
and, then, lifting her head, squeezes onto the couch
under her, taking her into his arms, warming her with
himself. She shudders and, still desperately asleep,
she begins to whimper and cry, and, sleeping still,

she suddenly clutches at him out of the terror of her.

making awkward, strangulated cries and arching panic-

He locks her in his arms. Quickly, the moment is over.
Her head sinks back onto his chest and then back: down
to his lap again, instantly, innocently asleep.

INT. THE KITCHEN - TWO HOURS LATER - DAY 229

Jessup in the kitchen, sitting at the table, legs
crossed, eating a sandwich, sipping coffee. He is in

(on phone)

Arthur, I'll call you back when
I'm more awake. Everything's fine.

She returns the phone to its cradle, notes the sun
fragmenting itself through the slits of the blinds.

EMILY
God, what time is it? I should
call the kids. Eddie, could
you throw that blanket over here?
I'm freezing.

JESSUP
I can't tell you how much you
mean to me, how much I need you
and the kids. I just wanted
you to know that.

EMILY
Why don't you just come back to
us?

JESSUP

It's too late.

He picks up the fallen blanket, brings it to her,
drapes it across her and the chair. She tries to
read his shadowed face as he bends over her.

JESSUP 230
I think it's too late. I don't thru
think I can get out of it any more. 247

The silence hangs between them; she doesn't quite know
what he means.

JESSUP
I've committed myself to it. I
don't think there's any way out.

He tucks the blanket around her and returns to his
dark corner of the couch. The widening shaft of
slatted sunlight divides them. She looks down at her
coffee mug.

JESSUP
The point is what happened last
night was more of a religious
experience than a scientific one.

EMILY
Yes, I know.

JESSUP
You saved me. You redeemed me
from the pit. I was in it, Emily!
I was in that ultimate moment of
terror tnat is the beginning of
life! I found the final truth!
I found it, touched it, ate of its
flesh, drank its blood! I've seen
it face to face, and it is hideous!
It is insufferable! The pain
cannot be described! It is nothing,
simple, hideous nothing! The final
truth of all things is that there
is no final truth! Truth is what's
transitory! It's human life that
is real!

He emerges out of the cucullate shadows in the far
corner of his couch to stand in the band of dust-moted
white light streaking across the floor from the
slatted window.

JESSUP
I don't want to frighten you,
Emily, but what I'm trying to
tell you is that that moment of
terror is a real and living
horror living and growing within
me now, eating of my flesh, drinking
of my blood. It's real because I
have made it real. It's alive.
It's in me. It is me. And the
only thing that keeps it from
devouring me is you.

EMILY 230
I think you're trying to tell me thru
you love me. 247
JESSUP

I'm trying to tell you why I love
you, that without you I would
have disappeared into unspeakable
terror.

She stands, pulling the blanket around her.

EMILY
I suppose that's why anybody loves
anyone.

JESSUP

For God's sake, Emily, don't be

so facile.

EMILY
I'm not being facile! My God, do
you think you're the only one
who has experienced despair? The
only one who has felt the utter
nothingness of life? We are all
creatures of despair, Eddie!
Life for all of us is a flight
from the unspeakable terror!
Life is an act of faith for all
of us! That's why we love each
other! It's the only act of
faith most of us are capable of!
At least, it's the only act of
faith I'm capable of!

JESSUP
I can't live with it, Emily. The
pain is unbearable.

EMILY

We all live with it. That
unspeakable doubt is what makes
us such singular creatures. We
hide from it, we flee from it,
we succumb to it, mostly we defy
it! We build fragile little
structures to keep it out. We
love, we raise families, we work,
we make friends. We write poems,
we paint pictures, we build
beautiful things. We make our
own universe, our own truth, we
believe in our own reality. And
every now and tnen, someone like
you comes along who goes out and
challenges it face to face.
Passionate men.

Poets, philosophers, saints and thru
scientists. What the hell do you 247

think makes me love you so much?

JESSUP
You don't understand.

They stare at each other. He is openly crying, his
face glistening with tears.

JESSUP
It's too late, you see.

He slowly raises his right arm and extends it for her
to see. The vivid sunlight bleaches it, makes it look
sepulchrally white. A bulge of protoplasmic substance
is moving slowly up his arm under the skin like a mole.
She stares, stunned. We hear a HUM, a resonating drone,
the throbbing SOUND of the pulsing primal energy forces
we had heard in the tank room the night before.

EMILY
(screams )
Defy it, Eddie! You made it real!
You can make it unreal! If you
love me, Eddie, defy it!

He stands immobilized, crying helplessly. His body
begins to RUMBLE, CRACK and buckle as if forces inside
it were about to break through tne surface. He begins
to rapidly change forms, some recognizable, some

merely monstrous. He seems to have no more substance
than a photograph, a projected illusion, a demented
kaleidoscope of instant, transitory, transparent images,
flackering madly in the wide shaft of sunlight. The
hideous DRONE has become insufferably penetrating. She
clutches her ears. She sees a quick fleeting image of
her husband reaching out his arms to her for help, dut
she is petrified, utterly immobilized. His arms turn
into stumps. She finally forces out a hissing

sibilant SOUND --

EMILY
(barely a whisper)
If you.love me, Eddie!

She is suddenly convulsed herself, clutching at her
stomach as some great pain explodes with her. The
blanket falls from her shoulders to the floor at her
feet. Her arms begin to bulge and swell and discolor.
A jagged crack appears on her forearm and shoots up
the length of her arm as if it were splitting open.

She slowly forces her arm up as if to show it to her
husband. It is now a stump, and even that stump is
losing its definition as the lines that define it be-
come wave-like and seem to melt into the shrieking air.

She feels a massive shock just inside her skull above 230
her eyes. A RED-HOT FLAME erupts from her bowels. thru
She seems to be burning alive. Her EYES DISAPPEAR. 247
She would scream except her mouth has disappeared as

well.

The SCREEN has become total, impenecrable BLACKNESS.

Then, out of the blackness, we HEAR a distant echo of
a scream, lightyears away in the ultimate blackness.
It grows louder. It is no longer a scream; it is now
rather a roar of rage, the fury of a raging animal.

Light begins to penetrate the total blackness. Forms
begin to take shape. We begin to recognize Jessup's
human form, flickering in and out of the madness of
all his other shapes, reasserting itself.

The blackness is all gone now. ‘We are back in the
living room of Jessup's flat. He is standing, a
completely human form again, naked, as immobile,
enmarbled as a statue, stark white. He is staring at
his wife, who is disintegrating into the shapeless
anti-matter that had been his condition the night
before. With a shocking wrench of effort, he takes a
step toward her, forcing humanness into himself. One
step, two -~ he reaches out to embrace the shapless-
ness of his wife.

It is instantly, abruptly over. The drone, the lunacy
of illusion, the whole shattering moment is done. What
we see, standing in the sunlight in the middle of their
living room is a young married couple -- a slight,
light-haired man of thirty-seven, beginning to bald
just a bit but looking boyish at the moment in his
Jeans and T-shirt; and a slim, gracefully naked young
woman, her face pressed against her husband, her arms
wrapped around his waist, a pair of young living
humans, standing embraced in the white sunlight of their
living room.

JESSUP
(after a moment)
I love you, Emily.
