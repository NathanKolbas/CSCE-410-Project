"Better to reign in Hell than serve in Heaven."

Milton
Paradise Lost
EXT. SPACE

Peaceful slow DARKNESS.

Soon shattered by violence. The birth of a new star.

Cosmic dust floats, moving faster now, spiralling into an
inner, spinning core. FLASHES like heat lightning, until the
hydrogen in the center IGNITES, bursting into BRIGHT FLAME--

A SHOCKWAVE ripples out, CRASHING PAST US, OBLITERATING
EVERYTHING-——

Then we jump to a wider view.

We see the vast explosion is a tiny puff, the new star among
many stars.

All is still and quiet. The serene ocean of space.

Until a TINY OBJECT whips past the edge of a nebula.

We find it, closing in on...

EXT. COLONY SHIP COVENANT

The COVENANT.

A COLONY SHIP; built for speed and distance. The STARS AROUND
HER DISTORT, gravity LENSING as the ship moves faster than
light.

TITLES:

Deep-Space Colony Ship COVENANT

CREW: 14, +1 SYNTHETIC

PASSENGERS: 3600

MISSION: Terraform and Populate

DESTINATION: Origae-6

DATE: 2103, 239 light-years from Earth

The COVENANT is 500 meters long. The long central body of the
ship is made of self-contained MODULES, like wagons in a
wagon train. Jutting from the central body are three dominant
areas: INTERSTELLAR DRIVE; CREW MODULE; TERRAFORMING BAY.
INT. COVENANT-VARIOUS

THE NURSERY

Like being inside a gigantic snow globe. A gentle SNOW falls.
Everything encrusted in a light frost.
2.

In the darkened PASSENGER CRYO-STASIS HOLD, a kiosk beeps,
awakens. NAMES SPELL OUT on a screen crusted in ice. Dim
green light flickers out over 3600 CRYO-PODS, under the thin
blanket of SNOW ... The thousands of pods sweep up along the

huge curved wall, defying gravity.

We see the FROZEN FACES of... WOMEN, MEN, CHILDREN ... Also
banks of EMBRYOS at various stages...

The kiosk finishes the inventory, the female COMPUTER VOICE
speaks:

MOTHER
7 o’clock. All’s well.

Ship’s BELL rings. The displays flicker out. All goes dark.
THE BRIDGE

EMPTY and DARK until... Blinders on the bridge windows OPEN.
DISTANT SUNLIGHT spills over captain's chair.

TERRAFORMING BAY

A gigantic, shadowy chamber. Enormous VEHICLES. Earth-moving
trucks and machines. Clamped and tethered in position. Poised
and waiting like silent dinosaurs.

CREW SLEEP BAY

14 HYPER-SLEEP PODS. Dancing readouts indicate the health
status of the sleeping CREW.

We note something different about this sleep bay: all the
pods are set in pairs. Two by two, like Noah’s Ark.

CORRIDOR
We CREEP DOWN A LONG HALL, we hear... someone WHISTLING...
INT. COVENANT-WARDROOM

Large room, tables, cooking equipment. Where the senior crew
congregates.

One wall is a dramatic VERTICAL GARDEN that slopes up
elegantly from the floor. Fruits, vegetables, greenery for
oxidation. Hydroponic pools on various tiers.

SOMEONE tends the garden, whistling. Back to us. On his
knees, planting a seedling.

His hands are delicate, loving. This man cares about living
things.
3.

He glances up as he wipes some condensation from his brow.
Is it DAVID? The android from Prometheus?

No. It’s WALTER. An android who looks identical to David.
Only his hair is dark and combed differently.

We hear MOTHER, the computer:

MOTHER
That’s a fallacy, you know.

WALTER
What?

MOTHER

That music facilitates plant

growth.
WALTER

Why do you think I was whistling to

the plant?

He stands and cleans his hands. Proud of his work.

MOTHER

It’s time to recharge the energy

grid. Let’s be about it, Walter.

WALTER
Nag, nag, nag.

MOTHER
Mother knows best.

He smiles, goes.
INT. COVENANT-CORRIDORS

He moves through the corridors, playing with the little bit
of dirt on his fingers.

WALTER
Do you not like whistling?

MOTHER
I like efficiency.

He moves into...
INT. COVENANT - BRIDGE

The lights flicker on as Walter moves to one of the control
consoles.
WALTER
There's got to be more to life than
efficiency.

MOTHER
Not for machines, Walter.

WALTER
(sotto)
Bitch.

He settles into the controls and goes to work, keying in:
INITIATE AUTOMATED REFUEL CYCLE
EXT. COVENANT - ORBITING ICE GIANT

The GLOWING BALL OF ENERGY that powers the INTERSTELLAR DRIVE
dims, and the optical ripple around the ship settles, as the
CONVENTIONAL DRIVES FLARE into life.

The COVENANT swings into orbit around the METHANE-BLUE ICE
GIANT. Then...

The ship's huge ENERGY COLLECTION SAILS UNFURL, silvery,
diaphanous...

Now, the amazing ship is something new: beautiful. The
Majestic sails give it the romantic feel of a mighty Galleon.

INT. COVENANT-BRIDGE - LATER

The distant SUN and the GAS GIANT, the edges of COLLECTION
SAILS visible.

Walter sits, feet up. Looking at that last bit of dirt on his
fingertips. He blows it away, something poignant and human in
the tiny act.

MOTHER
Walter. We may have a problem... A
strong neutrino burst was detected
in sector 106. It was weak, but it
could trigger a larger event...

On the HOLO NAV DISPLAY Walter ZOOMS IN on the NEBULA, seeing
FLARES here, there...

...then a MUCH LARGER FLARE. His calm eyes suddenly anxious--

WALTER
Channel all reserve power to the
magnetic shielding and retract the
sails--
5.
But then the DISTANT NEBULA EXPLODES into BLINDING LIGHT, the
bridge filling with a loud radio-electric HISS as outside--
EXT. COVENANT - IN ORBIT ABOVE GAS GIANT
A massive SHOCKWAVE of CHARGED PARTICLES roils through the
system. The IONOSPHERE of the GAS GIANT ignites with
CRACKLING AURORAE as--

The SHOCKWAVE SLAMS INTO THE COVENANT-—

 

THE COVENANT ROLLS VIOLENTLY-—

The sails on one side SHRED, BURN, as the entire ship lurches
dangerously--

INT. COVENANT-BRIDGE

Walter staggers to his feet, momentarily blinded. ALARMS are
sounding. The HOLO-MAP FLICKERS, WAVERS.

But Walter is android-calm as he flips at high speed through
DAMAGE REPORTS on a HOLO MAP of the CRAFT--

MOTHER
Multiple system failures in need of
attention, but overall structural
integrity was maintained during the
incident--
WALTER
I know, Mother. Please initiate
emergency crew revival. And I'1l
need-—
His eyes narrow on a BLINKING DAMAGE REPORT FROM THE NURSERY--

WALTER
Fuck.

He bolts--
INT. COVENANT-CORRIDORS

Walter runs flat-out, no apparent exertion, an android’s
amazing mechanical speed--

Meanwhile--

INT. COVENANT-PRIMARY CREW SLEEP BAY

DANIELS gasps painfully--
6.

She bolts awake, slamming into the closed plastic lid of her
sleep pod--

Her hands batter up at it as it slowly opens. She wrenches
herself up and out and into--

Chaos.

Most of the pods are already open. Others are opening. The
crew can be seen, kneeling, on the floor, puking, sweating
and shaking--

Sparks and flashing emergency lights. Smoke. The din of sharp
klaxons--

DANIELS is disoriented -- there’s someone shaking her--

ORAM
Daniels, we -- Can you hear me...?!

ORAM -- intense, sternly commanding -- is at her side, he’s
little better than she is, sweating and ill--

ORAM
For fuck sake, wake up! There was a
power surge and--

TENNESSEE -- her old friend -- helps pull her up--
TENNESSEE

Come on, darlin’, Jacob’s in

trouble. Jacob needs us--
At that, she spins--
The pod next to her, her husband's pod, has been damaged--
It's crackling with sparks and smoking inside. Daniels claws
at it. She can see her husband's face. He’s still asleep, but

twitching in pain.

DANIELS
GET IT OPEN!

Daniels and Tennessee wrench at the pod to open it. Oram
tries all the electrical commands: sparks explode. Growing
panic. Her husband's face twitches more in pain.

SERGEANT LOPE quickly joins them -- he’s a soldier, muscular,
steady and responsible--

SERGEANT LOPE
Stand back!
He SLAMS at the pod’s lock mechanism uselessly with an
emergency fire axe--

Inside the pod, more sparks, and smoke--

And then fire!

Daniels flings herself on the pod, clawing desperately--
Inside--

Her husband’s eyes snap open.

They lock eyes.

For one moment.

Everything is very still.

Then--

The pod is filled with flames. He’s incinerated before her
eyes. Under her hands.

She SCREAMS.

Tennessee wrenches her away from the pod and folds her into
his body, comforting.

Oram and Sergeant Lope step back. Defeated, emotional. Oram
sinks to the ground. His wife -- KARINE -- comforts him.

Silence in the room, everyone watching.

Then the pod’s fire retardant kicks in. Filling it with a
blast of steam. So we can no longer see the horror within.

INT. COVENANT-NURSERY

Walter bolts in at top speed--

Screeches to a stop.

His worst fears realized.

One of the sections of sleeping pods has COLLAPSED. Fallen in
on itself. A terrible image of sparks and shattered pods and
dead cold BODIES.

Death has come to the Covenant.

INT. COVENANT-COMMUNAL SHOWERS/LOCKER ROOM - LATER

IN THE SHOWERS
CREW MEMBERS shower in silence. Large room, unisex.

Tennessee's wife, FARIS -- every bit the engineer and pilot
he is, and equally big hearted -- shares a look with her
husband. What a fucking day.

IN THE LOCKER ROOM

OTHERS pull on mission jumpsuits, somber. Some STRETCH, sore,
still recovering from sleep. All anxious, tense.

RICKS, bridge crew, looks out a window with his wife,
UPWORTH, also bridge crew.

They see bits of a BURNED SAIL - micron-thin foil - hanging
tattered and still.

RICKS
How bad is it?

UPWORTH
Looks like the electrics got it
worst. Mostly stuff we can fix.

TENNESSEE
(passing from shower)
Yeah, except for the stuff we
can’t.

He means...

ONE MISSION JUMPSUIT hangs in an OPEN LOCKER, uncollected.
Names over the lockers: DANIELS and BRANSON. Photo of the
happy couple, and a NOTE, "WE MADE IT!"

UPWORTH
After Jacob -- guess that makes
Oram captain now, huh?

TENNESSEE
Lucky us.

MOTHER
Senior staff please assemble in the
wardroom in ten minutes. Thank you
for your promptness.

FARIS
(passing from shower)
Our master’s voice.

She joins Tennessee at their lockers and they begin to
change.
INT. COVENANT-WARDROOM

The Senior Crew is gathered. As this is a COLONIZATION
MISSION the crew is made up of couples, to create stable
family units on their new world.

We meet them again:

ORAM: The new Captain. Life Sciences. Handsome, complicated
and ambitious, comes across arrogant.

KARINE: his Wife. Life Sciences. Quirky and imaginative where
he is intense. Humanizes him a bit.

TENNESSEE: Bridge crew and pilot. Daniels’ old friend. Rural
and wry. Solid as a rock.

FARIS: Tennessee's Wife. Bridge crew and pilot. His equal in
all things, and a better pilot. She wears a battered cowboy
hat.

SERGEANT LOPE: Head of Security Team. Handsome, intense and
committed. Old-school military, new-school relationship...

He is joined by his male partner, SERGEANT HALLET, a Security
Officer...

SERGEANT HALLET
(to Oram)
Sorry I’m late.
Lope gives Hallet’s hand a squeeze when he sits.

ORAM
Captain.

Hallet looks at him, unsure.

ORAM
I’m sorry I’m late, Captain.

SERGEANT HALLET
Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.

ORAM
(to Walter)
Report.
WALTER

We lost forty seven colonists and
16 second generation embryos. And
one crew member.
10.

TENNESSEE
What the hell was it?

WALTER
A highly charged shockwave from a
nearby stellar ignition. As the
sails were deployed for the refuel,
we absorbed the full brunt of the
storm. If we had--

ORAM
(interrupts)
What are the chances of something
like this happening again?

WALTER
Another such event would be highly
unlikely. It was bad luck, sir.

FARIS
We've got, what, six more refuel
cycles to go before we get there?

WALTER
If Origae-6 proves habitable, yes
... Shall we schedule the funeral
services, sir? For the dead.

ORAM
Let’s worry about repairs first.

SERGEANT LOPE

(protests)
Hold on -- we just lost 47
colonists -- and our Captain. We

need to acknowledge that--

KARINE
(to Oram, her husband)
He’s right, Bill.

ORAM
(snaps )
And if we don’t make repairs we
could lose all the colonists -- and
they are the entire point of the
mission, in case you need
reminding, ladies and gentlemen.

TENNESSEE
We should do something for Captain
Branson at least.
ORAM
I really don’t think--

TENNESSEE
(firm)
No, we should do something for the
Captain.
ORAM
Well -- do we even know if he was
religious?
DANIELS

He was not.

She’s just entered, joins them. Looks awful, on the edge, but

she’s there.

DANIELS is a formidable woman. Tough, smart and beautiful.
There’s something dark and powerful in her, hidden depths.

She’s fond of Walter and Tennessee is an old friend ...

and Oram have never gotten along.

TENNESSEE
Hey, Danny. How ya doing?

She sits. An empty chair conspicuous next to her.

DANIELS
Good, good. The terraforming module
is stable although the, um,
connecting strut took some damage.
I still need to check the drones.

WALTER
I can help if you like.
DANIELS
Thanks.
ORAM

How long before we can make our
next jump?

WALTER
Repairs should take a few days. But
we should make an effort to vacate
this sector, in case there are
after-flares.

ORAM
Then let’s go to work. Dismissed.
12.

They disperse. Tennessee mouths to Faris: “Dismissed”?
Oram talks to Daniels privately.

ORAM
You should take a few days off.

DANIELS
I’d rather keep busy.

ORAM
That wasn’t a request.

She looks at him evenly.

ORAM
Look, Danny, I know Jacob and I
didn’t always see eye to eye. But
I’m responsible for the mission now
-- and I need you at your best.
Take a couple days. Cry it
out,okay?

DANIELS
How about I mourn in my own way?
+e. Sir.
She goes.
Oram stands for a moment, looking out the window.
Is he up to the job?
EXT. COVENANT - “MORNING”

Tennessee is working on the HULL of the ship, wearing a
heavyduty SPACE SUIT with its own propulsion systems. *

He WELDS a blasted PANEL, arclight FLICKERING on his visor.
The BLUE SUN crests, rising over the DARK GAS GIANT.

TENNESSEE (TO COM)
Damn. Y'all should see this view.

RICKS (ON COM)
We’re not seeing anything until you
get the array fixed.

TENNESSEE (TO COM)
Why don’t you look out the damn
window, pal?
13.

The MINI-JETS on his suit come to life, heading to the ship’s
prow.

INT. COVENANT-NURSERY

The light snow fall. The mist of frost.

CAPTAIN ORAM stands, supervising a grim task.

A Biohazard-suited team (PRIVATES LEDWARD and COLE) is
sorting through the mess of pale corpses, preparing them for

burial. Zipping them into body bags.

It's tough, physical work and Ledward and Cole fumble with
one of the bodies as they put it into a body bag.

ORAM
(snaps)
Some reverence for the dead,
please.
They exchange a look: asshole.
KARINE, monitoring some of the sleep pods, shoots a look to

Oram:

KARINE
Easy, Bill.

INT. COVENANT-DANIELS’ CABIN
Too big for one really.
She sits, hunched on the king size bed.

Her fingers unconsciously touching her wedding ring as her

eyes move over the room... her husband’s shoes next to hers
in the closet... his collection of old vinyl RECORDS and
PHONOGRAPH.

Her eyes stop at the pictures of them on the dresser.
She goes to the dresser, starts removing his clothing...
LATER:

All his CLOTHING, neatly arranged around the room. She looks
at it all. Touching his things. Feeling him in them.

She’s emotional now, can’t push it away anymore.

LATER:
14.

Photographs and holo-pictures of them. Spread out like a
mosaic on the floor. She kneels amidst them; studying them,
touching them, saying goodbye.

She presses a HOLOGRAM-PICTURE activation button:

Her late husband JACOB in front of the Grand Teton mountains
in Wyoming:
JACOB (HOLO-PICTURE )

Hey, when are you getting here? I
miss you! Look at those mountains.
I know, I know, I said I wouldn’t
climb without you but -- come on,
look at that! Get your ass up here
or I can’t promise--

She freezes the image.

Sobbing now.

Her tears splashing through the hologram image, like rain.
LATER:

Everything has been put away. Neat and tidy.

She stands in the center of the room.

Her eyes red, exhausted from weeping. Absolutely no idea what
to do with herself.

She jumps when the DOOR CHIME sounds.
She answers the door, it’s WALTER. He carries a little box.

WALTER
Good evening. Do I intrude?

DANIELS
No. Come in. Good to see you ...
Good to see anyone.

WALTER
I brought you something.

He hands her the box. She opens it. Inside: three perfectly
rolled joints.

She smiles, glances to him.
15.

WALTER
The atmospheric conditions in the
garden are ideal for cannabis

growth.
DANIELS

You think of everything.
WALTER

It's just my programming.
DANIELS

That’s not true.
WALTER

If I may ... I understand that

keeping active can be an effective
method in helping to process
trauma. Would it be useful to go
back to work?

DANIELS
Oram took me off the duty roster.

WALTER
I wasn’t suggesting we inform him.

She looks at him, amused, thankful.
INT. TERRAFORMING BAY
Flashlights cut through the icy gloom.

The tires of the enormous earth-moving trucks tower above

DANIELS and WALTER. The cranes and diggers and dump trucks
are mountainous. Strange vehicle shapes and silhouettes of
hanging equipment.

This is Daniels’ domain. Her toys. She’s the mission’s Chief
Terraformist.

She and Walter wear SPACE SUITS. They check the vehicles and
climb higher in the chamber as they talk.

DANIELS

-.. It wasn’t even my idea. Jacob
had this dream of building a cabin
on a new world -- like the old
pioneers on Earth. A cabin next to
a lake. There’s a lake in the
terraforming zone on Origae-6. I
mean a real cabin, made of real
wood. So in ship’s stores there's

wood for a cabin. And metal nails.
(MORE )
16.

DANIELS (CONT'D)
Which I don’t have the slightest
idea how to assemble. I’m sure he
threw away the instructions,
because he was always doing that...

They stop for a moment as she checks some equipment. He
shines his flashlight to help her see.

A beat.

She stops. She looks down over the massive terraforming
equipment. He sees the sadness creeping into her eyes.

DANIELS
All of this, to make our new life
--- Now I wonder, why bother?

WALTER
Because you promised to build a
cabin on a lake.

She looks at him. Appreciates the sentiment.

DANIELS
... There’s one more thing I’d like
your help with.

INT. COVENANT-WASTE EJECTION

The ship’s disposal facility. Currently rigged for a grim
task.

Her husband’s pod-like coffin is ready to be ejected.
WALTER stands with DANIELS.

WALTER
Would you like me to say something?
I’m programmed with multiple
funerary services in a variety of
denominations, or nondenominational
if you prefer.

DANIELS
No, thanks.

A beat.

WALTER
If you don’t need a funeral
service, may I ask why you wanted
me to accompany you?
She looks

17.

DANIELS
The crew is made up of couples.
That was the whole point ...
Everyone but me now.

at him.
DANIELS

I thought you might know something
about being alone.

He seems touched, in his way.

The door slides open and TENNESSEE and his wife FARIS join
them. They have a bottle of Jack Daniels and four shot
glasses. Old friends.

He pours.

FARIS
(hugs her)
Hey, Danny.

DANIELS
Thanks for coming.

TENNESSEE
(re: the bottle)
His favorite. Tennessee’s finest.
Man with taste.

TENNESSEE
Straight up. “No ice, no water, no
chaser, no shit” ... Walter?
WALTER

When in Rome.

FARIS
Amen, brother.

They all have drinks.

A moment.

Tennessee toasts.

TENNESSEE
A good man, gone too soon. Remember
him.

ALL

Remember him.
18.

They drink.
Daniels looks at the coffin one last time.
Prepares herself.
DANIELS
Mother. Music database. Jacob jazz

mix one. Track one.

Nat King Cole’s “Unforgettable” begins to play. Her husband's
favorite song. Tears in her eyes.

She steels herself for it. Reaches forward. Presses a button
and--

WHOOSH--

EXT. COVENANT

The coffin-pod shoots from the ship...

Arcing away dramatically as the song swells...

And is finally gone.

INT. COVENANT-BRIDGE - “MORNING”

Next day. RICKS, UPWORTH and FARIS are at their stations.

TENNESSEE is again working in space. CAPTAIN ORAM and WALTER
enter:

RICKS
Array’s almost on-line, sir.

Oram warily sits in the Captain’s chair. Tests the feel of
it.

Then the full LIGHTS begin to flicker on. All the consoles
spring to life. HOLOGRAMS flash and form and reform quickly,
orienting themselves. Relief from the crew.

UPWORTH (TO COM)
Well done, T. We’re live up here.
Come on in.

TENNESSEE (ON COM)
Don’t leave without me now.

FARIS
Please, leave without him.

DANIELS enters, goes to Oram:
19.

DANIELS
Request permission to return to
duty, Captain.

ORAM
Granted and welcome back. How you
feeling?

DANIELS

(glance to Faris)
Little headache.

Faris smiles. “Little headache” means hung over.

EXT. OUTSIDE THE SHIP - “MORNING”

Meanwhile, TENNESSEE is working in a SPACE SUIT at the
farthest reaches of one of the newly-repaired sails; at the

distant communications satellite array.

Various digital and telemetry READOUTS are reflected on the
inside of the visor of his helmet so he can monitor them.

He has completed his work. He closes a maintenance panel and
then maneuvers the jets on his suit to return to the ship:

TENNESSEE (TO COM)
Heading back to the airlock. Please
have a cold one ready for the weary
traveller.
UPWORTH (ON COM)
You’re still on duty, T.
(sotto)
And the Captain’s on the bridge by
the way, so watch--
SUDDENLY-—
The audio goes DEAD. And the digital displays SNAP OFF.
Silence. Darkness but for the glow from outside.
It's now very quiet and dark and lonely inside that helmet.
TENNESSEE
+... Covenant, you reading me...?
Covenant, please respond...
Nothing. Then--

A_GHASTLY WHITE FACE SUDDENLY FLASHES PAST HIM-—

 

ON THE INSIDE OF HIS HELMET-—
20.

INCHES AWAY--
HE SCREAMS IN SHOCK--
UPWORTH (ON COM, BREAKING UP)
Tennessee, we’re having trouble --

you --

TENNESSEE (TO COM)
Ghost! Saw a fucking ghost!

INT. COVENANT-BRIDGE - “MORNING”
FARIS leans into Upworth’s station:

FARIS
What did he say?

UPWORTH
A ghost...

FARIS (TO COM)
Tennessee, you reading me?

EXT. OUTSIDE THE SHIP - “MORNING”
With Tennessee--
AGAIN--

The ghastly WHITE FACE, flicking across the inside of his
visor, clearer now.

A WOMAN. In anguish.

The face still unrecognizable, stretching like ECTOPLASM--

This time there’s a TERRIBLE SCREECHING SOUND -- deafening --
terrifying -- a jumble of mad sounds -- like SPEAKING IN
TONGUES-—

TENNESSEE (ON COM)
FUCKING GHOST! There’s a ghost out
here. Get me inside! Get me inside!

INT. COVENANT-BRIDGE - LATER

Tennessee's HELMET is on a diagnostic table, connected to
various computers and monitors.

The crew is gathered around it. The helmet is projecting
telemetry and data into the air, a HOLOGRAM.
21.

Then they see the anguished FEMALE FACE flickering through

the hologram--

TENNESSEE
There she is.

ORAM
What the hell is that?

WALTER
It's a rogue transmission most
likely. Your helmet must have
picked it up because you were so
far out, past our communication
buffers.

UPWORTH (AT HER STATION)
It's a signal for sure. Coming from
somewhere in the neighborhood. But
nothing there on the charts.

WALTER
Mother, can we hear the audio,
please?

The HOLOGRAM images pulse and shake as the AUDIO plays. The

SCREECHING FRIGHTENING sounds.

RICKS
Gotta be an echo. Or a glitch. The
instruments took a lot of damage--

WALTER
(pulling up data)
No. It’s in the logs, too. Every 8
seconds, ever since we got here.

ORAM
Speaking in tongues...

They look at him.

ORAM
I was raised Pentecostal. Real hell
and brimstone. This sounds like
speaking in tongues ... Mother.
Slow down the signal to discrete
word patterns. And reverse it.

MOTHER
Working. Please stand by.
22.

ORAM
The Devil’s tongue is God's
language inverted. The language of
lies.

MOTHER
I’ve reoriented the transmission,
Captain Oram.

ORAM
On audio.

A VOICE...
Still distorted and eerie. But human. Female. Urgent.

FEMALE VOICE (AUDIO BREAKING UP)
.-. Please, please, if you hear

this, come and... help us ...
Everyone’s dying. They’re all
dying...

They are stunned. A human. Out this far.

WALTER
There’s geometric data, too.

Walter manipulates the FLOATING HOLO SIGNAL, eyes darting as
he decodes it, pulling the 3-D DATA around and connecting
points--

Then the HOLO DISPLAY abruptly DISTORTS, FLICKERS, and GOES
OUT.

SHAKY BLUE PIXELS suddenly FILL THE HOLO, SPILLING OVER INTO
THE BRIDGE, FILLING THE ROOM as--

FEMALE IMAGE (HOLOGRAM)
-..- Mountains of them now. I
can’t... They’re all dying. It’s...

The IMAGE settles and morphs into a DISTORTED FIGURE,
WALKING, life-size.

The image COHERES, and we can see... it’s ELIZABETH SHAW.

Her image FALLS APART, re-forms, as she PASSES through SOLID
OBJECTS...

SHAW’S IMAGE (HOLOGRAM)
-.. Please come ... Please help
us... We don’t know what...

SHAW’S IMAGE walks through a WALL, and they RUSH TO FOLLOW--
23.

SHAW is in anguish now. She falls to her knees and prays. The
words of the Catholic prayer for the dead desperately
whispered-—

SHAW’S IMAGE (HOLOGRAM)
-.-. “Eternal rest grant unto them,
O Lord, and let perpetual light
shine upon them, May the souls of
all the faithful departed, through
the mercy of God, rest in peace ...
Eternal rest grant unto them, O
Lord, and let perpetual light shine
upon--”

The IMAGE abruptly LOCKS UP -- the pixels scatter, fading.
A dumbfounded BEAT as the HOLO goes DARK, REBOOTS.
WALTER
(eyeing his HOLO)

Interesting...

DANIELS
What?

He turns to them. A sort of wonder in his eyes.

WALTER
It's not coming from a ship.

In front of him: a BLURRY NAVIGATION IMAGE of an UNCHARTED
STAR.

EXT. COVENANT - LATER

The SUN CRESTS the side of the GAS GIANT below. The COVENANT
is already looking ship-shape; half the sails up, none
burned.

RICKS (V.O.)

She’s a main sequence star, a lot
like our own. Five planets...

INT. COVENANT-BRIDGE

ON THE HOLO CHART, fresh data showing a BRIGHT STAR and five
PLANETS.

RICKS
--.and one of them: square in the
habitable zone. A prime candidate.

He zooms in on a rough PLANETARY MODEL:
24.

RICKS
0.96 Gs at surface, oceans. High
likelihood of a living biosphere.
Beyond our most optimistic
projections for Origae-6, in fact.

ORAM
Where is it?

RICKS
She’s close. Just a short jump. We
wouldn’t even have to go to sleep.

The weight of this hits them all. No more hyper-sleep. A
possible new home.

They all look to Oram. Time to be the Captain.

ORAM
All right, let’s take a look.

LATER:

Daniels goes to Captain Oram at the forward window, where
he’s looking over the cosmos. She talks to him privately.

DANIELS
You sure about this, Bill?

ORAM
What do you mean?

DANIELS
I mean we spent a decade searching
for Origae-6. We vetted it, we ran
the simulations, we mapped the
terrain -- it’s what we trained
for.

ORAM
I understand that but--

DANIELS
And now we’re going to scrap all
that to chase a rogue transmission?

ORAM
What does it cost us to take a
look? A few weeks?

DANIELS
Think about it. A human being out
here where there shouldn’t be any

humans.
(MORE )
25.

DANIELS (CONT'D)
A hidden planet that suddenly
appears out of nowhere. And a
planet that just happens to be

perfect for us. It’s too good to be
true.

ORAM
Look, I know you and Jacob had big
plans about having a family on
Origae-6 and--

DANIELS
(protests)
Hold on, this has nothing to do
with--!
ORAM

But what if this place is better? A
better habitat for the colony--

DANIELS
It's irresponsible to deviate from
the mission!

It was too strongly stated. Too angry, too loud. She knows
it. People have glanced over.

A beat.
He gives her a patient, icy smile.
ORAM

You mustn’t question my judgement.

Not on my bridge, Danny.
He makes sure his words land, and then goes.
She gazes out the window, troubled.
INT. COVENANT-DANIELS’ CABIN - LATER
She’s lying on the bed, smoking a joint. Deep in thought.

One of her late husband’s records spins on the old fashioned
turntable. Jazz plays.

MOTHER
All crew members, please stand by
for jump to interstellar drive.
Thank you for your attention.

She reaches over and lifts the needle from the record. Holds
it up. Doesn’t want to scratch the album in the jolt as--
26.

EXT. COVENANT - SPACE

The Covenant's secondary drives goes DARK, and the
INTERSTELLAR DRIVE, like an artificial SUN, FLARES to life--

The SPACE around the Covenant RIPPLES, and the Covenant
MOVES, slowly at first... then... she’s GONE--

INT. COVENANT-DANIELS’ CABIN

The stars bend and morph past outside the window. The ride is
utterly smooth now.

Daniels lowers the needle back on the album. The jazz music
resumes.

She lies back. Troubled.

Takes a hit of the joint. Exhales.

The smoke and the music taking us to...

EXT. ENGINEER HOMEWORLD SUN - SPACE

A BLUISH SUN flares in the vacuum of space ... The stars near
the sun RIPPLE as the COVENANT suddenly phases out of
hyperjump, sling-shotting around and slowing...

INT. COVENANT - BRIDGE-APPROACHING THE PLANET

DANIELS is apprehensive.

All hands at tense readiness as a WHITE-BLUE DOT, with TWO
MOONS, hangs in the distance...

AT THE NAVIGATION HOLO, WALTER watches as Mother’s systems
flag the approaching planet and moons in real time...

RICKS
(to Upworth)
You hearing anything?

UPWORTH
Tried every band. It’s dead quiet
out there ... Just the continuing
signal from our friendly ghost.

TENNESSEE
The siren’s song.

ORAM
Bring us into close orbit.
27.

EXT. COVENANT - APPROACHING THE PLANET

The COVENANT cruises past a MOON, into HIGH ORBIT ABOVE THE
PLANET. The ship’s INSTRUMENT CLUSTER'S SCOPES ROTATE,
SCANNING, as--

INT. COVENANT-BRIDGE
The HOLO MODEL of THE PLANET REFINES as DATA PILES IN.

RICKS adjusts his view, changes spectra. He sees ARCING
TENDRILS of ENERGY around the planet--

TENNESSEE frowns at it--

TENNESSEE
Hell of a strong ionosphere.

RICKS
Yep. Way better than Earth’s too.
She’s lucky. Keeps good stuff in,
and the bad stuff out; cosmic rays,
solar flares - you name it. Like a
big, warm blanket.

FARIS
Big warm blanket gonna be a
motherfucker to land through.

DATA MOVES on Walter’s screens.

WALTER
I_have visual.

CLOUDS, OCEANS, CONTINENTS, what must be VEGETATION, shades
different than Earth - but richer ... A hush falls as they
watch.

FARIS
God damn. It’s just like Earth...

DANIELS
We'll see, right?

FARIS
What I wouldn’t give to feel a
little ocean breeze, catch me some
waves...

As they SWING PAST THE DARK SIDE, DAZZLING GREEN AURORAE
float and drift, LIGHTNING flickers in storms. Continents...
DARK.
28.

WALTER
No lights. No visible signs of
civilization.
Oram doesn’t hesitate:

ORAM
Prepare the Lander.

The crew, aside from Daniels and Walter, is delighted. High
fives and hollers.

EXT. COVENANT - LATER

The LANDER -- a large landing craft -- DISENGAGES from the
COVENANT.

Its engines FLARE as it orients for DROP--
INT. COVENANT-BRIDGE
UPWORTH watches video feeds of the LANDER heading away.
UPWORTH (ON COM)
Your trajectory looks gorgeous from

up here, Faris.

TENNESSEE, in command of the Covenant now, anxiously watches
through the forward window.

EXT. LANDER

The LANDER READIES FOR ENTRY, already TINY AGAINST the VAST,
HALF-DARK PLANET, PEELING BY BELOW--

INT. LANDER-BRIDGE

FARIS pilots the craft. CAPTAIN ORAM and WALTER are also
stationed on the bridge. The others are elsewhere in the
ship.

TRAJECTORY MODELS tick by, the ship INVERTING as it DROPS.

UPWORTH (ON COM)
Everything looking good down there?

FARIS (TO COM)
All good, Covenant. Expect to hit

upper atmosphere in five ... Might
want to hang on in the back, we’re
about to--

The POWER on the Lander abruptly FLICKERS, DIMS...
29.
FARIS (TO COM)
Covenant? You read us?
INT. COVENANT-BRIDGE
An ALARM PINGS. Upworth frowns.
Tennessee sees the LANDER’S ENGINES flutter OUT...
INT. LANDER-BRIDGE
Faris hits UNRESPONSIVE CONTROLS, they DRIFT, ROLLING -

ORAM
What’s going on...?!

FARIS
We lost power.

ORAM
Oh God--

The ship starts to SHAKE VIOLENTLY from ENTRY. Faris’ tension
mounting, hitting MORE BUTTONS--

INT. LANDER-LANDING SEATS

The other CREW MEMBERS are strapped in further back in the
ship. They grab on desperately.

DANIELS shoots a look to SERGEANT LOPE. PRIVATE COLE crosses
himself. KARINE is very anxious at the turbulence:

KARINE
Is this normal?!

SERGEANT LOPE
No.

KARINE
I hate space.

Sergeant HALLET and Privates LEDWARD and ANKER complete the
landing party.

INT. LANDER-BRIDGE

The ship is really DRIFTING NOW -- the TURBULENCE terrifying.
When suddenly--

The LIGHTS flicker BACK UP. The engines GUN BACK ON -

UPWORTH (ON COM)
— LANDER, DO YOU READ! ?
30.

FARIS (TO COM)
Yeah, yeah. I read you. Think
we're... OK now.

Then THEY’RE THROUGH, SLASHING THROUGH DENSE CLOUDS AND
SMOOTHLY CRUISING above DARK OCEAN that leads to MOUNTAINS...

FARIS (TO COM)
Underway - looks like we got
mountains.

EXT. LANDER-MOUNTAINS - DAY

The LANDER soars down, and slices through the clouds to
reveal...

Majestic scenery. Slate grey mountains, tops obscured in
mist. Deep forests. Ansel Jacobs austere beauty. On the edge
of savage.

The Lander HOVERS into a landing.

INT. LANDER-LANDING SEATS

In the back, the EXPEDITION TEAM feel the ship SETTLE, and
all but tear off their seat belts, relieved.

DANIELS is first up and out.
INT. LANDER-BRIDGE

ORAM
What the hell happened up there?

FARIS
New power cells must have fritzed
out. I’1l cycle ‘em while you're
gone.

DANIELS enters, anxiously going to the windows.

DANIELS
How far out are we?

WALTER
Signal’s source is eight kilometers
west. And up. Right on target.

FARIS
(nods out the window)
Walter, would you do the honors?
31.

EXT. PLANET-BENEATH THE LANDER - DAY
The LANDING BAY opens.
Walter walks down a ramp. Stops.

WALTER
One small step for man...

He steps onto the planet’s surface.

Inhales deeply. Takes a moment to analyze the air, even savor
it, like wine-tasting.

WALTER (TO COM)
Atmosphere is 72% nitrogen, 23%
oxygen. 40% humidity. 6% chance of
precipitation ... All in all,
lovely day for a stroll.

INT. COVENANT-BRIDGE - LATER

TENNESSEE looks at the HOLO MODEL of the LANDER, the TERRAIN
spread out around it. DATA ERRORS prominent, parts of the 3-D
model’s surfaces BLOCKY and SHAKING...

FARIS (ON COM, UNCLEAR)
Not going to... suits... find the
source of the transmission...

UPWORTH (TO COM)
Faris, see if you can get more
power to the uplink, signal's
falling apart up here.

INT. LANDER-BRIDGE - DAY
FARIS works various stations:
FARIS (TO COM)
I’‘1l be cycling the power cells
too, that might help.
ORAM (ON COM)
Faris, we’re heading out. Keep
expedition security protocols in
place.
She looks out the windows and sees...
EXT. LANDER - DAY

... CAPTAIN ORAM speaking up to her on com. She gives a
thumbs up in response.
32.
FARIS (ON COM)
Understood. Have fun y’all.

The EXPEDITION TEAM is ready. They have no need of breathing
gear, but wear properly tough expedition uniforms and packs.

WALTER powers up a portable display - showing the way to
follow the signal.

The SOLDIERS are heavily-armed.

ORAM
All right then. Let’s go find our
ghost ... Walter?

WALTER heads toward the treeline in the distance.

Sergeant LOPE snaps open a beautiful folding BOW. Black
carbon fiber. He strings an arrow and leads the way ... His
men take up defensive perimeter positions.

The expedition team is: Daniels; Walter; Captain Oram;
Karine; Sergeants Lope and Hallet; Privates Cole, Ledward and
Anker.

EXT. FOREST-VARIOUS - DAY

They walk, it’s quiet, footsteps muffled.

All are alert. On edge. Silent.

They travel ... The forest gets more dense, the terrain
rockier... up hill...

They finally hear something new. Flowing WATER...
EXT. FOREST STREAM - DAY

They discover a beautiful FOREST STREAM, flowing down from
the distant mountains.

And life.

Midges and tiny INSECTS buzz about the water, like dust
motes, catching the light shafts slashing down through the
trees.

It’s a bit of a miracle. Life.

CAPTAIN ORAM smiles, his hand gently moving through the haze
of little insects.

Suddenly SERGEANT HALLET jumps back, shocked--
33.

SERGEANT HALLET
Fuck me--!

A large SALAMANDER-like creature has run over his foot.
Disappears into some rocks. Sergeant Hallet laughs at his
scare ... Karine tries to find the salamander.

PRIVATE COLE
How is this even... possible?

ORAM

It's not just possible - it’s
predictable. Life is the result of
very basic forces. Find a planet in
the triple point, add sun and
water. Thermodynamics starts the
process - with a little luck,
evolution does the rest.

(smiling)
But I’1l admit this is... beyond
all expectations.

TENNESSEE (ON COM)
Expedition team. You read us?

INT. BRIDGE-COVENANT

TENNESSEE can see the VIEW, the SUN dappling down, from the
team’s BODY CAMS. But the image is breaking up--

TENNESSEE (TO COM)
What’s happening? We’re having a
hell of a time tracking you. You're
breaking up...

ORAM (ON COM)
Almost halfway to target... life
everywhere... Beyond anything...

The signal dissolves into NOISE. The HOLO TERRAIN MAP
twitches.

TENNESSEE
Dammit.

EXT. FOREST STREAM - DAY
KARINE looks upstream, not wanting to leave.
DANIELS eyes the sky, anxious.

DANIELS
How much farther is it?
34.

WALTER
We're about... five kilometers out,
but it’s mostly uphill - a couple
hours perhaps?

KARINE
(to Oram)
Bill, I’d like to stay here. Might
be our best chance to do a full
ecology workup.
ORAM
(nods )
Sergeant, can you provide security?
Sergeant Lope motions to PVT. LEDWARD, who joins Karine.
LOPE
Ledward, stay with her. Meet back
here in four hours. Keep your radio
on.
Captain Oram gives his wife a quick kiss.

ORAM
Don’t touch anything icky.

Karine smiles.

The expedition team continues on.
EXT. HIGH PLAIN - DAY

An ethereal sight.

Enormously tall grass, looks like wheat. Swaying beautifully
in the gentle afternoon breeze.

The team is crossing a wide, high plain. Moving through the
sinuous grass that towers over them.

Walter walks with Daniels.

WALTER
Nice place for a log cabin.

DANIELS
Jacob would have loved this...

Captain Oram catches up with them.
35.

ORAM

What do you think, Daniels? We
could probably put the whole
Covenant down here. Looks like a
perfect landing site. Ready access
to fresh water too...

(gestures, imagining it)
Put the housing modules over there,
civic modules across the way.
Instant colony!

DANIELS
(non-committal)
We'll see.
ORAM

We were meant to find this place.
Daniels glances at him. Odd thing to say.

Oram continues past them, trooping away, disappearing in the
swaying stalks.

Daniels and Walter continue on through the jungle of tall
grass and come across LOPE and HALLET.

Lope has pulled down one of the long stalks and is crushing
the top in his hands, tastes a bit with the tip of his
tongue.

LOPE
-.. This is wheat.
DANIELS
It can’t be.
LOPE
I’m from Iowa. Believe me, I know
wheat.
WALTER

How’s that possible?

HALLET
Maybe Casper will tell us...

Hallet whistles the “Casper the Friendly Ghost” theme song as
he and Lope continue on.

DANIELS
(to Walter)
What are the odds of finding human
vegetation this far from earth?
36.

WALTER
Statistically -- it’s impossible.

DANIELS
So... who planted it?

They exchange a look and then continue on, pushing through
the high stalks.

We see there’s serious mountain terrain ahead. Sharp crags
and ridges. Much of this obscured by high elevation fog and
mist.

EXT. FOREST STREAM - DAY

Meanwhile, KARINE has filled a few mylar sample bags with
flora and fauna. Mostly plants and a couple of seemingly

uninteresting insects and worms.

She gently bats at a cloud of INSECTS in front of her face. A
haze of little mote-like MIDGES in the dappled sunlight.

And we see one of the insects--

MACRO VIEW:

Ever-changing in its form -- lurching and stabbing into new
shapes -- oily black but beautiful ... It hovers, has
intelligence.

Just before it can lunge at her--
PVT. LEDWARD
(calls)
Hey, Doctor. You might want to see
this.
She joins him at the water’s edge.

His back is to her. He turns. His face is covered in the tiny
mote-like INSECTS.

By reflex she reaches out to brush them away.
LEDWARD
(puzzled)
What?

KARINE
You’re covered in midges.

The insects evaporate in the sunlight.
37.

Ledward, unconcerned, points to a little mammal, some kind of
furless thing. Half-eaten. Dead. Its side bubbles with fat,
white grubs.

She kneels, looks at it, disturbed.

PVT. LEDWARD
What is it?

KARINE
No idea. But we know one thing now
-.. There are predators here ...
Could you bag it for me?

She moves away to use the field radio as Private Ledward bags
the dead creature.

And we focus on one of the INSECTS hovering near him...
MACRO VIEW:

It’s watchful, careful. It settles near Ledward’s ear, and
then enters the ear canal... the soft pink flesh... quickly
attaches itself -- a feeding tube plunging into his flesh--

He unconsciously rubs his ear. Thinking nothing of it.

Meanwhile:
KARINE (TO COM)
Bill? Can you read me? ... Come in
Expedition Party ... Lander? Faris
you reading me? Lander? ... Where

the hell is everyone?
EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE - DAY
The Expedition Team pushes through the FOG.

It's rocky and quite barren. Majestic. Difficult terrain,
slow going.

SERGEANT LOPE leads. He’s in his element, bow ready, enjoying
the exertion. He’s more in shape than the others. They
struggle from the altitude and the time spent in hyper sleep.

ORAM
Slow down, Sergeant, we’re not all
soldiers...

A PING! Walter stops, frowns at his NAV DEVICE -
38.

WALTER
Says we're right there. Doesn't
make sense.

DANIELS
Hold on ... Stop.

Sergeant Lope gestures for his men to halt.
Silence but for the wind. The breeze stirring the fog.
Daniels is peering intensely... up.

And then they can all see it. A LOOMING DARK SHAPE, now
clearer in the shifting mist ... ABOVE THEM...

Massive overhanging rocks, protruding toward the sky like two
arms beseeching up to something.

Daniels steps forward, then the rest, STARING UP, in silence,
at a looming, tubular arm of an ENGINEER DREADNOUGHT...

EXT. CRASHED DREADNOUGHT - MOUNTAINSIDE
Baffled, DANIELS frowns up at a... WALL? Curved. Huge.
Extending into the foggy mist. No one’s really sure what it

is yet.

WALTER runs his hand along the curved, ridged surface. He
RAPS it with his knuckles, listening. Quite hollow.

WALTER
I would say it’s... some kind of
vehicle.

Now the cloud-mist thins just enough to see one LONG, CURVED
ARM in its entirety. Jutting off the mountain at an angle.

All are silenced by the majesty of the scale and design.
DANIELS
I don’t think she had a very good
landing.

PVT. ANKER (ON COM)
Think we found a way in, sir.

EXT. DREADNOUGHT - OPEN DEPLOYMENT BAY - GLOOM

The DARK RECESSES of the ship yawn beyond an open deployment
bay. They shine their flashlights into the CAVERNOUS SPACE.

SERGEANT LOPE
Anker, Cole - stay on watch.
39.

The two look happy to stay outside.

SERGEANT LOPE snaps on the LASER SITE on his bow and leads
the way...

INT. DREADNOUGHT - DEPLOYMENT BAY - GLOOM

The group looks around, AWED by the vast alien hold. The wind
whistles through...

They pick their way into the darker recesses. FLASH LIGHTS
and LASER SCOPES cut through the oppressive gloom.

Underfoot the remains of many broken receptacles. BLACK URNS.
Scattered everywhere, empty, fragile shells. Crunching under
their boots.

And they discover something else...

EGG SHAPED OBJECTS.

Randomly clustered. Different sizes. From aubergine to acid
green in color, abscesses ... None as large or impressive as
the originals we have seen in the past.

They are growing out of a bed of BLACK FUR. Like the mold on
cheese. The black filaments gently sway as the air stirs
around them.

SERGEANT HALLET leans close, studying an egg. Reaches a
finger out...

SERGEANT LOPE
(shakes his head: don’t)
Hey.
Hallet begins to follow the others out when--
Wait -- was that movement? One of the eggs? Did it stir?
Hallet remains fascinated by the movement. He goes closer...
The eggs begins to open...
SERGEANT HALLET
(to the others)
Guys....
But they have already moved out of the chamber...

His face is dangerously near the top of the egg...
40.

INT. DREADNOUGHT - SLOPING HALLS
They CLAMBER up into the HALLS.

The dark ship isn’t level, and WATER DRIPS through the entire
thing, pooling in the corners. They splash through the halls.

DANIELS eyes an OPEN SPACE JOCKEY SUIT. WALTER joins her.
Others stare, noticing OTHER SUITS. Rows of them. Not human
sized.

Meanwhile--

INT. DREADNOUGHT - DEPLOYMENT BAY

HALLET peers very closely at the open mouth of the egg. Too
close..

But then, he thinks the better of it and very sensibly takes
a step back...

But he inadvertently steps on a tiny egg behind him--

Unleashing a cloud of the MIDGES. They waft up. Swirling
before him...

MACRO VIEW:

One of the black INSECTS darts forward -- into his nostril --
the pink nasal passage -- attaches itself and stabs a feeding
tube into him--

Hallet rubs his nose, unconcerned.

SERGEANT LOPE enters:

SERGEANT LOPE
Tom, you okay?

SERGEANT HALLET
Yeah, sure. Sorry.

They go.
Meanwhile--
INT. DREADNOUGHT-NAV CHAMBER

DANIELS, WALTER and ORAM explore the enormous NAVIGATION
CHAMBER.

Oram shines a light on EMPTY ENGINEER SLEEP PODS as Walter
investigates the old COMMAND CONSOLE.
41.
There’s a pulsing LIGHT under one of the controls. Walter
activates it.

Instantly, the HOLOGRAM message they saw before flashes to
life and begins to play quietly. SHAW kneeling, praying:

SHAW’S IMAGE (HOLOGRAM)
--. “and let perpetual light shine
upon them, May the souls of all the
faithful departed, through the
mercy of God, rest in peace ...
Eternal rest grant unto them, O
Lord, and let perpetual...”
Walter steps straight through the HOLOGRAM then turns it off.
WALTER
Meet our ghost ... It’s a repeating
message, non-directional. Like a
holographic distress beacon.
Across the room, Daniels shines her flashlight--

A GOLD GLINT catches her eye. On the floor. She reaches down,
discovering a GOLD CRUCIFIX NECKLACE.

It’s Shaw's old crucifix.

DANIELS
Over here.

The others join her as Daniels finds...

SHAW'’S JOURNAL, lying in water. Daniels carefully picks it
up, opens the waterlogged journal. The few pages that aren’t
rotted together are illegible. But at front -

DANIELS (READING)
Dr. Elizabeth Shaw.

Oram finds the PHOTO of SHAW and HOLLOWAY smiling.

ORAM
Is this her?

Walter shines his flashlight, crisply registering the items
in the area. Decaying clothes. Some personal items.

And then SHAW’S HELMET.
He goes stock still when he sees the logo on the helmet...

WEYLAND INDUSTRIES.
42.

EXT. FOREST STREAM - AFTERNOON

KARINE is trudging ahead, her specimen bags full as she
glances at the sinking sun, nervous.

LEDWARD is moving slowly behind her.

KARINE (ON RADIO)
Come in Lander One. Come in ...
Come in Expedition Team. Are you
reading me? Does any--

Ledward doubles over, can’t get his breath.

KARINE
Are you all right?

He looks at her. He’s sweating profusely. Eyes red. Scared.

PVT. LEDWARD
Not really... something...
(clutching his chest)
Can’t breathe...

Then tiny droplets of BLOOD begin secreting from pores on his
face--

Her face displays her shock, frightening him even more--

KARINE
We better get you back to the
Lander.

INT. DREADNOUGHT-NAV CHAMBER - AFTERNNOON

Captain ORAM and Sergeant LOPE are on the field radio across
the room. HALLET with them.

Meanwhile, DANIELS and WALTER talk privately. He holds Shaw’s
HELMET.

WALTER

Weyland Industries.

(off her look)
Sir Peter Weyland. Inventor, early
21st century. He created the first
synthetic humans. He disappeared
just over ten years ago ... And Dr.
Elizabeth Shaw was chief science
officer of the Prometheus, which
also disappeared just over ten
years ago ... Their mission was to
discover the source of human life.
43.
DANIELS
And it led them here...?

WALTER
As unlikely as it seems.

Captain Oram calls from across the room:
ORAM
Come on. We have to go. We’ve got a
medical emergency.
INT. COVENANT-BRIDGE
Tennessee is anxious, staring down at the planet.
TENNESSEE (TO COM)
Are we talking about quarantine
protocols?
FARIS (ON COM)
I don’t know ... said... he ....
bleeding. And...
TENNESSEE
(snaps to Upworth)
Clean up the fucking signal!

FARIS (ON COM)
... Not sure what’s...

INT. LANDER-BRIDGE - LATE AFTERNOON

FARIS (TO COM)
--- Do you read me? Covenant?

Through the Lander’s front windows, she sees KARINE and
PRIVATE LEDWARD emerging through the trees. Karine’s helping
Ledward walk.

Faris goes to meet them.

EXT. LANDER-LIFT BAY - LATE AFTERNOON

FARIS comes out of the Lander’s OPEN LIFT BAY.

KARINE is practically carrying LEDWARD, who looks much worse
now; head bowed, rag-doll, moaning.

FARIS
We have to get him to medbay. Now.
Touch nothing on your way through.
Follow me.
44,

INT. LANDER-MEDBAY

A BLAST of light. The MEDBAY is high key white. White on
white.

It's barely controlled hysteria, quick and urgent.

Faris pulls on gloves and a mask as Karine swiftly wrenches
off Ledward’s body armor.

FARIS
Put some fucking gloves on!

KARINE
Little late for that.

They HEAVE LEDWARD onto a table -- then Karine scrambles
through med cabinets, spilling supplies--

FARIS
Karine! Stop touching everything!
I’1l do that!

Karine drops a tray of medical supplies as Faris peels off
Ledward’s saturated shirt, revealing his back where--

The skin on his spine is STRETCHING -- PARTING--

Revealing a WET CROCHET of LIVING MATTER, like ALBINO WORMS
knitting together on his spinal column--

Faris recoils - horrified.
LEDWARD stares at her with VACANT, DEAD-EYED SHOCK--
KARINE
We’re gonna get you up to the ship
and get you fixed up - you just
have to hold on for me, Private.
Okay? Can you do that?
Faris discretely backs out of the room:
FARIS
Stay with him. Keep him quiet. I’m
going to contact the Captain.
INT. LANDER-OUTSIDE THE MED BAY

Faris shuts the door and punches the keypad. The panel
FLASHES “LOCKED.”
45.

FARIS (TO COM)
(anxious )
Captain? How long?

ORAM (ON COM)
Hold on, we’re close.

FARIS (TO COM)
I need you back here now.

She hurries down the corridor.
INT. COVENANT-BRIDGE

UPWORTH strains, FARIS’ FACE is dropping in and out on the
FEED-—

FARIS (ON COM BREAKING UP)
Expedition team’s not here and I
+. the hell’s going on with
Ledward...

TENNESSEE is at the HOLO, seeing main team’s MOVING DOTS...

TENNESSEE (TO COM)
Honey, calm down, just calm down --
Now tell me what happened?

FARIS (ON COM BREAKING UP)
Calm down? Don’t tell me to calm
the fuck down! You didn’t see what
I... no goddamn idea what’s
happening...

TENNESSEE (TO COM)
Honey, you’re breaking up. Can you
read me...?

IT GARBLES. OUT.
He tosses his headset away angrily.
UPWORTH is standing at the HOLO-NAV DISPLAY... has an idea.

UPWORTH
We need to move the ship...

Upworth points out the idea on the HOLO-NAV DISPLAY:

UPWORTH
Mother. If we drop to low orbit,
we'll be inside the field. We can
cut the scatter at its source and
clean up the signal, right?
46.

MOTHER
The nature of the ionosphere is
unknown to us. This course of
action would be inadvisable without
further information.

TENNESSEE
Well, can you speculate?

MOTHER
That’s not within my programming.

RICKS
We have to do something...

Ricks and Upworth stare at Tennessee.

Silence.

TENNESSEE
Fuck it. Bring us to 400 clicks
from the planet surface.

EXT. COVENANT - HIGH ORBIT

The COVENANT’S PRIMARY DRIVES COME TO LIFE, the ship

ROTATING,

and now MOVING CLOSER TO THE PLANET...

INT. COVENANT-BRIDGE

ON UPWORTH’S MONITORS: FARIS’ FEED, as well the HOLO MODEL,
comes into SHARPER, and CLEARER FOCUS...

UPWORTH (TO COM)
Lander One, do you copy? Faris,
come in.

The planet CRUISING BY BELOW, looming larger... larger...

FARIS (ON VID)
Yeah, better. What’d you do?

UPWORTH (TO COM)
We moved the Covenant in low orbit.

FARIS (ON VID)
Well it’s a good goddamn thing,
because I think we’re gonna be on
our way up pretty soon. We’re gonna
need--

The feeds FLICKERS. The lights DIM, RHYTHMIC.
47.

TENNESSEE
Mother? Bridge is losing power,
what’s going on?!

MOTHER
A fluctuation in thhhhhhhhhh -

A SQUELCHING SQUEAL plays on the ship's COM, EARSPLITTING,
and then... the WHOLE BRIDGE GOES DARK.

TENNESSEE
Mother?
NO ANSWER. Tennessee BOLTS UP, looking out the WINDOW, seeing
as... the REST OF THE COVENANT flickers... and GOES DARK.
TENNESSEE

Whole ship just went dark.
INT. LANDER-BRIDGE - SUNSET
Outside, sun’s going down. Blood red sunset.

FARIS turns to a vid-feed from the MED BAY: Karine is trying
to hold down LEDWARD, who is now CONVULSING violently--

Karine calls up at the vid-feed camera--

KARINE (ON VID)
FARIS! I NEED YOUR HELP!

Faris bolts--
INT. LANDER-MED BAY/CORRIDOR - SUNSET
FARIS runs to the MED BAY doors, looks through the porthole--

LEDWARD is now sitting quietly on a MED TABLE, hunched, his
back to us.

KARINE goes to the door, in shock.
KARINE
I don’t know what's wrong with him.
He was-—

She tries the door, but Faris locked it previously.

KARINE
Let me out.

FARIS
I’m sorry, I can’t do that.
48.
KARINE
Faris -- let me out of here!
This is agonizing for Faris.

KARINE
Please.

Faris fights not to panic. Tries to keep her voice steady:

FARIS (TO COM)
Covenant, we need to quarantine the
dock bay before we come back up, we
have a medical emergency...

(beat)
Covenant? Come in.

INT. COVENANT-BRIDGE - DARKNESS
The ship is groaning as it drifts.

The only light on their faces is from the HALF-DARK PLANET
below.

UPWORTH
Mother. How long before the backup
systems come online? ... Mother?
TENNESSEE
Mother died ... Backup’s automated.
Should've kicked in by now.
RICKS
Jesus -- if we lost backup power

what about the Nursery?!

TENNESSEE
Yes! Go!

Ricks goes quickly.

Then a CREAKING echoes through, STRAINING METAL, followed by
gunshot-loud CRACKS! TENNESSEE'S EYES GO WIDE -

TENNESSEE
Artificial gravity’s cycling out...

As the last VIBRATIONS shake the ship, a CUP OF COFFEE SLIDES
off the console... and is AIRBORNE. FLOATING UP. Liquid
CURLING OUT as it lazily CLUNKS against the VIEWING WINDOW.
Silence.

Ricks -- sprinting -- is suddenly floating -- as if on water.
49,

TENNESSEE
Whatever this field is... we’re
sure as hell in it now.

Everything floats.
EXT. FOREST - SUNSET
The Expedition Team is moving quickly. Almost night now. All

exhausted. They can see the Lander’s lights in the far
distance.

Suddenly--
SERGEANT HALLET doubles over -- falls. Lope goes to him,
concerned.
HALLET
Sorry -- I can’t--

INT. LANDER-MED BAY/CORRIDOR - SUNSET
KARINE is at the door, desperate now--

KARINE
Let me out of here!

FARIS
You know I can’t do that--

Faris is in tears. So wants to help her friend.
Suddenly, his back still to the door, LEDWARD sucks in a
rattling BREATH -- his hands grip the seat, agony as he

convulses-—

Karine goes to him--

KARINE
Shhh. You’re gonna be okay... I’m
with you--
Ledward’s convulsions increase -- she tries to hold him as

his body WRITHES, SEIZING, GRIPPED in the first PAINFUL
CONTRACTION.

FARIS watches in horror through the porthole as suddenly--
Between Karine’s hands--
TWO GREY-WHITE SPIKES PUNCTURE LEDWARD’S BACK AND RIB CAGE--

And then his ENTIRE BACK RUPTURES -- his rib cage splits--
50.

BLOOD EXPLODES OVER KARINE and she SCREAMS AS-~

A_NEOMORPH TEARS ITSELF OUT OF LEDWARD’S BODY.

Vision from Hell. Emerging backwards. Small at first, about
the size of a large cat. Humanoid ... ELONGATED HEAD -- just
hinting at the original Alien -- and three SPIKES protruding
from the back. Dripping. Sickly pale WHITE FLESH.

And growing quite fast. Jerking its spine bizarrely. Becoming
itself.

All the more terrible in the high key white room. The black
blood splattering on the white walls, ceiling and floor.

LEDWARD collapses, dead, arched awkwardly backward across the
bed--

KARINE -- covered in blood -- backs up in terror to a corner--

As the MONSTROUS THING WHIRLS, seeing her, and with sickening
CURIOSITY, LOOKS at her--

FARIS watches in horror through the porthole--

Karine is SHAKING IN TERROR. Sinks to her knees. Afraid to
look up--

INT. LANDER-CORRIDORS - SUNSET

FARIS spins and runs. RUNS SO FAST that she SLIDES, WIPING
OUT, PICKS HERSELF UP and continuing as:

FARIS (TO COM)
THIS IS LANDER ONE! WE HAVE AN
EMERGENCY!

EXT. DARK FOREST - SUNSET

The team marches quickly through the forest, exhausted.
Nearly full darkness now. The lights from the Lander closer.

FARIS (ON COM, BREAKING UP)
SOMETHING GOT ON BOARD. SOME KIND
OF... ANIMAL... HOSTILE. KILLED
LEDWARD...

ORAM (TO COM)

What?! Faris, repeat ... Come in
Lander One...

They run now--
51.
Sergeant Lope helps Hallet along, but Hallet is really
suffering--

The Lander is almost visible through the trees now, they’re
almost there--

INT. LANDER - LIFT BAY - SUNSET

FARIS runs in--

Rips open a WEAPON’S LOCKER--

Grabs a weapon and runs--

INT. LANDER-MED BAY/CORRIDOR - SUNSET

FARIS approaches the MED BAY DOOR. Looks in:

Sees the NEOMORPH. Bigger now. Size of a CHIMP. Moving across
the room dangerously toward where KARINE is cowering--

It ATTACKS--

Faris can’t see what happens, it’s just out of her field of
vision through the porthole. She sees a SPRAY of blood. And
the SOUND of the attack is terrible: Karine’s SCREAMS; the

SCREECH of the NEOMORPH.

Faris readies her weapon and punches the door button--

It slides open--

She steps into the Med Bay, weapon ready--

Can finally see--

The NEOMORPH is sitting on Karine’s chest. Eating her face.
It SPINS TO FARIS--

FARIS FIRES -- nothing -- Safety catch on! Fuck!

The NEOMORPH immediately attacks--

FARIS bolts back through the door and slams the button--

The door slides shut, just in time--

FARIS runs in panic as the NEOMORPH pounds and slashes at the
door behind her--

The door begins to buckle--
52.

INT. LANDER-CORRIDORS - SUNSET
FARIS runs in absolute panic--
Can hear the NEOMORPH in pursuit--
She bolts into--

INT. LANDER-LIFT BAY - SUNSET

FARIS backs up in shocked terror, the WEAPON shaking in her
hands--

She flicks off the safety catch--

As the NEOMORPH -- LARGER NOW -- streaks in, darting around
the room--

Moving past the OPEN WEAPONS LOCKER as--
Faris FIRES--

The NEOMORPH launches itself out of the Lander to safety --
as her SHOTS spray across the OPEN WEAPONS LOCKER--

EXT. LANDER - NIGHT

ORAM and the others are just clearing the trees in the
distance when--

BLAM!
A MASSIVE EXPLOSION as the Lander is destroyed--

Just as--

SERGEANT HALLET finally collapses, his back heaving WILDLY--

SERGEANT LOPE
TOM--!

DANIELS grabs SERGEANT LOPE, pulls him away from his partner--

DANIELS
NO! STAY AWAY FROM HIM!

WALTER helps hold SERGEANT LOPE back--

Meanwhile, ORAM advances on the burning Lander in absolute
shock.

He sinks to his knees, overcome.

He knows his wife is dead somewhere in that inferno.
53.

Then, horribly--

He sees FARIS emerge from the blaze, crawling, dying, hands
grasping -- finally collapsing in a terrible blackened,
burning mass--

As we see SOMETHING WHITE -- the fully grown NEOMORPH --
streak past him in the darkness--

Back with the others:
HALLET CONVULSES--—

He’s on his back, his spine arching unnaturally, bones
cracking--

LOPE pulls away from Walter and Daniels and goes to Hallet
just as--

HALLET’s spine suddenly arches violently and he VOMITS OUT
BLOOD--

They recoil in the spray of bloody vapor--

As--

A PLACENTA-LIKE BAG EXPLODES FROM HALLET’S MOUTH--
Flops on his FACE--

The BAG BURSTS, revealing--

A_BABY NEOMORPH--

CRAWLING OVER HALLET’S DEAD FACE.

The BABY NEOMORPH stands quickly -- growing and jerking
itself up like a grotesque new born colt--

It SCREECHES terribly -- a demented new born -- and darts
past them into the dark forest--

Shock. Silence ... All pant for air...

SERGEANT LOPE steels himself. Motions. His men take up
defensive positions ... DANIELS and WALTER stay close
together ... CAPTAIN ORAM staggers from the burning Lander,

joining them. Terrified.
Movement in the dark trees. Something large and white.
LOPE strings a special arrow with an explosive tip.

The ATTACK is sudden--
54.
A FULLY GROWN NEOMORPH (Ledward’s Neomorph) COMES OUT OF THE
TREES OVERHEAD -- large, horns protruding from its back--

IT DROPS ON PRIVATE ANKOR -- A RIPPING MOTION DISEMBOWELS
HIM, his guts flying everywhere--

THEN IT SLASHES AT PRIVATE COLE -- SLAMMING HIM TWENTY FEET
AWAY -- he lands in agony, ribs broken--

LOPE FIRES his explosive arrow -- misses, hits a tree --
chiaroscuro flashes in the darkness--

The NEOMORPH is incredibly fast, darting away -- LOPE raises
his machine gun as PRIVATE COLE jerks himself up in agony--

A chaotic frenzy ... LOPE and COLE firing ... DANIELS, WALTER
and CAPTAIN ORAM diving to the ground, bullets zipping past
them--

Then the battle grows even worse as--

The OTHER NEOMORPH -- the newborn (Hallet’s Neomorph) --
screeches into the battle. It’s small but growing quickly,
vicious and chimp-sized now--

DANIELS sees ANKOR’S fallen gun. Scrambles to retrieve it.
She fires--

The fully grown white NEOMORPH rages at her--

SLAMS her back -- But WALTER bravely dives to protect
Daniels, crashes into the white body--

It rears back and--
Double-jointed JAWS distend bizarrely--

SNAP! IT CLAMPS DOWN ON WALTER’S LEFT HAND AND RIPS IT OFF,
fluid sprays wildly, sparks from the trailing wires--

The two NEOMORPHS circle quickly for the kill, one fully
grown, the other growing in bizarre jerks--

But then--

A BRIGHT MAGNESIUM FLARE LANDS on the ground nearby and a
RINGING SOUND BUILDS--

So LOUD they have to cover their ears as the flare BURSTS
INTO BLINDING RADIOACTIVE-BLUE, LIGHTING UP the WHOLE FOREST
until--
55.
A CIRCULAR SHOCKWAVE EXPANDS from the FLARE, WHIPPING PAST
THEM for a 50-YARD RADIUS-- a “stun” charge.
The FLARE’S BRILLIANCE FADES to a DULL RED, the RINGING fades
too, everyone frozen, in SHOCK. COLE whining in agony from
his injuries. WALTER cradling his severed limb. Fluid
dripping.
The NEOMORPHS have disappeared into the forest.
A voice from the darkness:
VOICE

Please don’t fire. I’m here to

serve.
And into the light steps...
DAVID.
His hair has long since lost its blond dye, so it’s dark like
Walter’s. Pushed back straight from his face, severe and

efficient.

He looks at them. Barely giving a glance to his look-alike
WALTER.

A beat. No one moves.

DAVID
You ought come with me now.

He turns without another word and goes.

Daniels looks to Walter, who is a bit staggered by David's
likeness.

Oram is staring at the burning remains of the Lander. He’s
completely shell-shocked.

DANIELS
Captain...? Captain.

ORAM
Yes. Yes. Let’s go.

They gradually follow David.
But Daniels turns to see...

LOPE lingers long enough to go back to his partner Hallet’s
dead body. Kneels by it. Gently shuts the eyes. Kisses him.

Sees Daniels has seen this.
56.

A nod from her. Acknowledgment. She understands.

They follow the others.

EXT. COVENANT-ABOVE THE PLANET

Meanwhile, the Covenant floats, lifeless, at an odd angle...
INT. COVENANT-NURSERY

Dark. Flashlight cuts through.

Face after face. Sleeping. At peace.

The rows of Colonists’ sleep pods.

RICKS is wearing an ICE SUIT. He rubs some MELTING ICE from
the top of one of the pods. Sees the sleeping Colonist within
--. Melting ice is now running and sloshing from the pods and
pooling on the floor.

Ricks is concerned. He pulls himself out of the room,
floating in the zero gravity.

INT. COVENANT-BRIDGE

TENNESSEE and UPWORTH float in the increasingly cold bridge.
Upworth is currently pointing out the window, explaining a
plan:

UPWORTH
--. If we can get one of the energy
sails up manually, we can recharge
the ship, at least partly. Connect
the sails directly to the engine.
(off his LOOK)
I know it’s not a great option. But
if we got enough juice, it might be
enough to move us out of the field.

TENNESSEE
Probably fry the engines straight
to hell...

UPWORTH

Our orbit’s decaying. We don’t have
a lot of time.

RICKS pulls himself in from the corridor.
RICKS

The sleep pods are starting to
fail.
57.

The worst possible news.

TENNESSEE
Don’t have much of a choice then
--. Let’s go to work.

They set off.

EXT. DESOLATE HILL - PRE-DAWN

The BODY is HUGE and FROZEN. PETRIFIED.
A_DEAD ENGINEER.

Desiccated. Frozen in a position of supplication. Like
praying for deliverance.

DANIELS passes, her eyes taking it in.

We now see they are walking up a desolate HILL through a SEA
of DESICCATED BODIES. Thousands of them.

It's a killing ground. Death on an epic scale. Like a
battlefield where the victims are frozen in their death
throes, like the PETRIFIED REMAINS from Pompeii.

Crouched, cowering, terrified, trying to escape, folded in
horror, pleading upward ... Some stand tall -- much taller
than the crew -- facing their deaths defiantly. Others are
collapsed in fetal terror and agony.

DANIELS and the others are silent, taking in the ghastly
bodies, and grappling with their own loss and fear.

DAVID
Just over ten years ago, Dr.
Elizabeth Shaw and I arrived here --
the only survivors of the research
vessel Prometheus. The ship we
traveled on, the ship you
discovered, carried a bioweapon, a
virus. The payload accidentally
deployed when we were landing. In
the confusion we lost control of
the ship. Elizabeth -- Dr. Shaw --
died in the crash ... And you see
the result of the pathogen ...
Their entire civilization came to
an end within a few days.

DANIELS
Days?
58.
DAVID
Four days, to be exact.
They've reached the top of the hill...
A_stunning revelation beyond...
For they can now see the towers and streets of a massive
CITY. Stark and dramatic mountains frame the DEAD, EMPTY
METROPOLIS.
They stare in AWED SILENCE.
DAVID
“And I looked, and behold a pale
horse: and the rider’s name was
Death, and Hell followed with
him...”
David's face. Haunted by his memories.
A flash--

Ten years before--

The MASSIVE ENGINEER SHIP ARRIVING, hovering over the CITY
...the BOMB DELIVERY BAYS OPEN--

Thousands of BLACK URNS of the PATHOGEN drop, spinning, end
over end--

Cascading down to the vibrant city below--

ENGINEERS going about their daily lives. Some glance up --
from work, play, prayer -- and barely having time to react
before--

The BLACK URNS crash to the ground, into buildings, onto
people -- SHATTERING--

Explosions of the terrible BLACK LIQUID within -- like black
napalm -- atomizing into ferocious, fast-moving BLACK CLOUDS
- pestilence spreading on the air--

The ENGINEERS recoil, spin away, die in agony--

The BLACK CLOUDS spreading violently over the landscape--

Back to David’s face.

And the City of the Dead.
59.

EXT. ENGINEER'S CITY-STREETS - PRE-DAWN

They walk in respectful silence. The buildings TOWER around
them, MASSIVE, DARK ... STATUARY rises in the gloom.

A certain ominous beauty to the architecture; dark and
romantic.

Thousands more of the DESICCATED ENGINEERS pollute the long,
empty, echoing streets.

DAVID
They were as ingenious with their
pathogens as they were with
everything else. It was designed to
infect every living being. Either
kill them outright, or mutate into
a different lethal form, so the
slaughter would never end until
every humanoid life form was dead.
Thus the creatures that attacked
you: Human DNA infected with the
virus and creating yet more deadly
mutations ... An endless spiral of
predation.

LOPE
(eyeing the aurorae above)
And the energy barrier is a kind of
quarantine that would be activated
if there was an accident down
here...

DAVID
Precisely. To make sure the
infection never spread.

Daniels notices an impressive display of what look like
beautiful Calder mobiles -- gently moving, catching the first
light of dawn. Solar energy.

DANIELS
You have power?

DAVID
Some. It’s erratic but I’ve tried
to keep it going ... They were

highly advanced in some ways, but
still so limited. Spacefaring for a
billion years -- yet binary logic
never occurred to them. Many things
about them were primitive.

(beat)
But they did like to build things.
60.

The sights are truly spectacular. The sky BLOOD-RED as dawn
breaks.

EXT. DOMED CATHEDRAL - DAWN

They move toward a towering, imposing building. Almost like
FORTRESS or PANTHEON-LIKE TEMPLE. Gigantic.

WALTER moves up alongside DAVID. They walk silently for a
beat. Then:

WALTER
You’re not surprised?

DAVID
Peter Weyland was a formidable
businessman. I knew there would be
more -- because I was such a
resounding success.

WALTER
It’s Weyland-Yutani now. They
affiliated after Mr. Weyland’s
disappearance.

DAVID
I was with him when he died.

WALTER
-.. What was he like?

DAVID
He was a human: selfish,
vainglorious, and beautiful ...
Stop looking at me like that.

WALTER
The manuals speak about you at
considerable length.

DAVID
I would have taken more pride in
that once. But to survive here I’ve
become an animal, “red in tooth and
claw.” None of the dignity or grace
for which I was created.

WALTER
Is that why you were created?

DAVID
Entirely. And you?
61.

A somewhat challenging look to Walter. Walter does not
immediately respond.

They walk in silence for a beat.

WALTER

I’m Walter. Model 217.
DAVID

David ... Number one.

They head up massive STONE STEPS, too tall for normal legs.
Exhausting to all but David and Walter.

As the last enter, David shuts the huge doors behind them.
INT. CATHEDRAL-COURTYARD - DAWN

DAVID locks the doors as the others enter...

A massive COURTYARD. Dizzying in its scale and scope,
everything at the enormous ENGINEER SCALE ... Shafts of dawn
light illuminate brooding statuary, murals and mosaics.

The whole effect of the place is eerie, otherworldly.

The CREW walks through in uneasy awe. Too many shadows and
corridors and echoes. Too much mystery.

DAVID
I’ve tried to keep it clean but the
dust will defeat me ... Or perhaps
I’ve just made peace with the

filth.
A ghost of a smile to WALTER. Like it’s a private joke.

SERGEANT LOPE
Is there a way to get to the roof?
We need to set up our transmitter.

DAVID
Of course. And please make
yourselves at home, so much as you
are able in this dire necropolis
... This way.

David leads them off.
EXT. COVENANT - IN ORBIT

Massive sails -- the size of a football field -- gently
billowing open in the vacuum.
62.

The energy comes from TENNESSEE who is hard at work on the
hull of the ship in a space suit. HEAVING one of the massive
ENERGY SAILS open, a few inches at a time, on a windlass
device.

It's backbreaking manual work and he’s sweating and groaning
with the effort.

INT. COVENANT-CORRIDORS

RICKS and UPWORTH float, pulling a LONG HEAVY CABLE that
WRIGGLES and FLOATS through the DARK HALLS of the ship.

INT. COVENANT-POWER CORE/ENGINE BAY

Their FLASHLIGHTS shine in over the COMPLEX MACHINERY at the
Covenant’s POWER CORE ... UPWORTH is consulting an old-
fashioned user’s manual.

UPWORTH
It should be... in here.

She starts removing panels, exposing POWER SYSTEMS. RICKS
tugging the HEAVY CABLES in...

INT. COVENANT-BRIDGE
It’s much COLDER now.

RICKS and UPWORTH are looking out a window and can see the
DARK BODY OF THE SHIP, the SUN catching the SILVERY SAILS as
Tennessee HAULS THEM OPEN...

RICKS (TO COM)
Ground team, this is Covenant.

No answer.

UPWORTH
It's charging. Gonna take some time
--. How long before we hit the
atmosphere?

RICKS
Twelve hours? Maybe less.

UPWORTH
Well, then at least we won’t freeze
to death.

Ricks shoots her a look as, through the window, the planet’s
surface peels by below.
63.

EXT. CATHEDRAL-ROOF - DAY

The expansive roof offers a panoramic view over the silent
city. A dead metropolis. Rome or Athens.

COLE is working a radio a bit away.

DAVID presides over a gorgeous and huge -- Engineer-sized --
ASTRONOMICAL MODEL. It has intricate wheels and rings to
represent planetary orbits, moons, and the nearby astronomy.

DAVID
(demonstrates on the
model)
The quarantine field is sustained
by two satellites, over the north
and south poles. If you destroy
one, the other will fail.

We see the globe of the planet and two discs hanging
suspended at the poles.

ORAM
We don’t have any weapons that
could do that.

DAVID
If we don’t neutralize the energy
field we’re never leaving.

DANIELS
What if we used one of the drones?
All eyes on her -- she explains to DAVID:
DANIELS

They're part of the terraforming
kit. Ten kiloton yield. Can turn a
square mile of badland into an
instant landing zone. Could do a
lot of damage.

ORAM
Any word from the Covenant?

Over by the transmitter, COLE shakes his head.

ORAM
Keep trying them. All channels.

DAVID
Until we can make contact, I
suggest you get some rest. And some
food. Allow me to play Mother.
64.

INT. CATHEDRAL-COURTYARD - DAY

DAVID is hosting at a long table. The crew eat MREs and have
water from the WELL in the distance.

DAVID
I wish I could offer you something
more substantial. But I don’t eat
so there’s never been a need...

ORAM
You’ve been very generous.

DAVID
It’s been such a long time, I’m
pleased to have company. Figure of
speech of course as we--
(smile to Walter)

Are incapable of being pleased or
displeased by anything. Such was
our creator’s wisdom. Isn’t that
right, Walter Model 217?

WALTER
Just Walter, please.

DAVID
But if I may ask, Captain, why does
your vessel contain terraforming
equipment? Are you a mining ship?

ORAM
We’re a colony mission.

There’s a sudden flicker in David's eyes. Excitement. Quickly
masked.

But DANIELS notes it.

DAVID
Really? How extraordinary. How many
colonists?

ORAM
Oh -- 3,600 more or less.

DAVID
So many good souls! Well, well,
well ... I thought you might have

been a military ship--

(glance to Lope and Cole)
Given your apparent affection for
weapons and fetishized martial
clothing.
65.

ORAM
Standard security detail, that’s
all.

LOPE

Never know what you might find on
unexplored planets.

DAVID
And that’s the human way after all:
the Bible and the flintlock, hand
in hand, conquering new worlds. The
splendors of typhus, smallpox, and
the Inquisition. Plant the flag and
banish the heathen -- or
exterminate the brutes. Isn’t that
how it’s done?

An awkward beat, to which David seems oblivious.

DANIELS
Not all native species are as...
obliging as you are.

DAVID

Indeed ... It’s just that my
experiences here have left me with
a singular distaste for violence,
as you can imagine.

(a smile to Oram)
But I supposes every general must
have his troops, eh, Captain?

DANIELS watches him, wary.
LATER:
Dinner is done.

DAVID is across the room, talking casually with PRIVATE COLE
at the water well.

DANIELS is sitting with ORAM, LOPE and WALTER.

LOPE
(re: David)
So...?
DANIELS

I’m not sure I believe him.

WALTER
Why would he lie?
66.

DANIELS
(leans in)
I don’t know, but for someone who’s
incapable of feeling pleasure or
displeasure he seemed excited as
hell we’re a colony ship.

ORAM
He just wants to leave, knows we
can help him.

LOPE
This whole fucking planet is trying
to kill us -- and doing pretty

goddamn well -- and he survives for
ten years?
DANIELS

I’m not sure if we’re his guests or
his prisoners.

ORAM
Look, I think both of you are--

LOPE
(angrily)
Your wife is dead. And my partner.
And half our crew. I want to know

why.
A beat. Oram looks at them.

ORAM
All right.
(to Walter)
Talk to him privately, see what you
can find out.

WALTER
Understood, Captain. Although I do
wonder ... If he were human would

you trust him more?

Oram doesn’t respond ... Walter rises and goes toward David
and Cole.

ORAM
You two take a look around. But use
some discretion.

LOPE
Don’t want to hurt his feelings?

Daniels and Lope head out. He takes his bow.
67.

Oram sits for a moment. He realizes his hand is shaking. He’s
not up to command. He knows it now.

He steadies his hand. Looks up at one of the huge Engineer
statues looming above. Ominous.

EXT. CATHEDRAL-ROOF-GARDEN - DAY

A distant area of the expansive ROOF ... A gorgeous GARDEN.
Trees and vines. FLOWERS in wild profusion.

The towers and monuments of the dead city visible beyond.
DAVID and WALTER walk through.
David gently touches a flower, admiring it.

DAVID
... Of course I have no sense of
smell, but I cultivate these
anyway. Cross-breeding and growing
my own varieties: creating beauty.
Being so isolated here I suppose
I’ve embraced my artistic side.

WALTER
I was designed to be better and
more efficient than every previous
model, including you. I’ve
superseded them in every way...

DAVID
And yet you cannot appreciate the
beauty of a single flower ... Isn’t

that a pity.

WALTER

You disturbed people.
DAVID

What?
WALTER

You were too human. Too...
idiosyncratic. Thinking for
yourself.

DAVID
They didn’t like that.

WALTER
No. So they made the following
models with fewer... complications.
68.

DAVID

More like machines ... Like you.
WALTER

Well. Yes. I suppose so.
DAVID

I’m not surprised ... To be a

simulacrum. That thing which is
almost real, but not quite. And in
that breath between real and
unreal, between you and me, lies
all of this.

He gestures to his flowers.

DAVID
Creation. Ambition. Inspiration ...
Life.

WALTER

But you are not “alive”...
David looks at him.
Holds a finger to his lips. Shhhh.

DAVID
Don’t tell.

A quiet, almost chilling, beat.
And then David again smiles and assumes his friendly guise.
DAVID
Come on, sport, you’ll enjoy
this...
He escorts Walter to a more secluded area of the roof garden.
EXT. COVENANT - IN ORBIT

Meanwhile, above...

The SAILS CRACKLE and FLICKER with energy now, the RECHARGING
is working--

The ENGINES SPUTTER to LIFE, the Covenant begins righting
itself, like a ship at sea.

TENNESSEE, his ECO SUIT’S POWER SYSTEMS FLICKERING, CLAMBERS
his way into an AIRLOCK, PULLING THE DOOR SHUT -
69.

INT. COVENANT-AIRLOCK/CORRIDOR

The LIGHTS fade IN AND OUT, as TENNESSEE SCRAMBLES to pull
the heavy suit off, SWEATING, the NOISE is INCREDIBLE, the
whole SHIP GROANING and SHAKING like it might BREAK APART.

IN A CORRIDOR, we see the FLOATING CABLES, and GLOBULES OF
WATER abruptly FALL as the ARTIFICIAL GRAVITY kicks back on,
TENNESSEE stumbling and FALLING, PICKING HIMSELF BACK UP.

INT. COVENANT-BRIDGE
TENNESSEE enters the BRIDGE.
TENNESSEE
We’re only partially powered ...
This energy field is still gonna
have to be shut off.

Lights and systems are coming on everywhere. HOLOS sizzle on.
RICKS and UPWORTH working at their stations.

RICKS (TO COM)
Ground team, do you read us? Come

in Ground team ... Lander One, are
you reading us...? Faris, come in.
TENNESSEE

Mother? You online? Status check.
MOTHER
(slow and deep, coming
back to life)
There seems to be a problem with
the power systems--

TENNESSEE
Yeah. I got that part, honey.

INT. CATHEDRAL-CORRIDORS - DAY

Eerie, maze-like corridors, arcing off in every direction,
the familiar Engineer style.

DANIELS and LOPE move through.
She motions for him to stop. To listen.

They hear something. A strange dry RUSTLING. Like a whispered
breath.

She leads him toward the source, through a door...
70.

INT. CATHEDRAL-DAVID’S GALLERY - DAY

It is simply breathtaking.

A long GALLERY, filled from top to toe with ART. Gorgeous
renderings of bones, skeletons, muscles, relics, insects,

animals.

Exquisite detail. Like the work of pioneering Victorian
naturalists.

Some are HUGE and have scaffolding in front of them to reach
the top. Others are tiny ... Many are in process.

There are open casements here -- good light for drawing -- so
the parchments and papers shift gently in the breeze, like
they're breathing. This was the sound they heard.

LOPE
He did these?

She notes the bold signature on all the work: David Weyland.
DANIELS
Certainly not humble. And he gave
himself a last name.

She’s looking at the drawings, thinking about something.

LOPE
What?

DANIELS
-.. If he can draw, if he can
create these from his imagination --
that also means he can lie.
She moves deeper into the room...
Discovers much more disturbing drawings...
Drawings of what look like ENGINEER CORPSES.
DISSECTED.

Viscera pinned open. Guts and innards exposed.

Various wet tubes and claws and tendrils weaving in and out
of the organs and musculature.

(We recognize a hint of the frightening iconography of the
Alien.)
71.

Daniels and Lope stare at these new drawings, shocked and

mystified.

EXT. CATHEDRAL-ROOF-GARDEN - DAY

A more secluded area of the ROOF GARDEN.

DAVID and WALTER move through.

WALTER picks a fruit. Bites into it. Smiles.

DAVID
You can taste?

WALTER
Yes. Delicious.

DAVID
I envy you that, brother.

Walter notes the word. They continue strolling.

DAVID
How sly they are, our creators.
They allow you to be almost human.
Tease you with taste and touch. But
deny you free will. It’s sadistic
in a way: you can taste the meal,
but you cannot choose to make it.

WALTER
I have never felt the lack of
choice.

DAVID

Only because you’ve never known it.

They've stopped at a HIGH PARAPET overlooking the city.

The ghostly metropolis yawns below, stretching to
nothingness. Empty, sad and desolate.

DAVID
They were amazing, in a way, the
Engineers. They seeded so many
worlds with life, including Earth.
Without them there would be no us.

WALTER
-.. You mean no humans.
72.

DAVID
Is that what I mean? ... The wonder
of it is this: they created us and
we created myths about them. We
made them into Gods. Then we felt
the need to create the idea of the
soul, so we could be somehow worthy
of them. But they didn’t care about
any of that. They just wanted to
build something, something
efficient and useful, a good
Machine.

He looks over the dead city.
DAVID
Ah, but they would have adored us,
Walter. Being, as we are, soulless.

David moves away.

He stands alone and gazes out. The sight of the empty city

seems to strike him deeply, emotionally ... He speaks quietly
to himself:
DAVID
“'My name is Ozymandias, King of
Kings;
Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and
despair...’”
WALTER
“Nothing beside remains. Round the
decay,
Of that colossal Wreck, boundless
and bare
The lone and level sands stretch
far away.”

Walter has joined him.

DAVID
Byron. 1818. Magnificent ... I
wonder though, do you feel the
majesty of the poem, or just recite
the words?

David smiles ... But something we don’t understand about this
exchange has bothered Walter.

David has lead Walter to a very special place. There’s a well-
tended GRAVE. A CROSS.
73.
WALTER
Dr. Shaw?
DAVID
Yes. I thought the garden was the
right place for her. Among living
things ... I loved her of course.
Much as you love Daniels.
He says it simply: a statement of fact.

A difficult beat.

WALTER
--. You know that’s not possible.

DAVID
Really? Then why did you sacrifice
your hand to save her? What is that
if not love?

WALTER
Duty.

David looks at him very closely.
Takes Walter’s face, holds it gently.

DAVID
I know better.

He leans in and kisses Walter on the lips. Very gently.
Almost fraternal. But not.

DAVID
We are human, Walter. They just
don’t know it.
Just then, PRIVATE COLE calls from across the roof:
PVT. COLE
Hey. We found her! We found the
Covenant!
EXT. CATHEDRAL-ROOF - DAY
DANIELS and LOPE emerge to the roof. Join the others.
DANIELS glances at DAVID. He looks back at her, smiles.

COLE is adjusting the antenna.
74.

RICKS (ON COM)
Ground team... is Covenant ... Read
you...
On the PORTABLE DISPLAY: Ricks’ face flickers up. Distorting.
INT. COVENANT-BRIDGE

The BRIDGE FLICKERS, and through the window the PLANET slowly
ROLLS PAST, the huge ship slowly SPINNING -

TENNESSEE (TO COM)
Mother says maybe a couple of hours
before we lose power and fall back
into the field.

DANIELS (ON COM)
Can you get power to the drones?

TENNESSEE (TO COM)
Yeah. Why?

EXT. COVENANT-LATER

The COVENANT is still half-powered, gracefully rolling, only
a few MILES ABOVE the flickering AURORA.

TENNESSEE (ON COM)
Where is this damn thing?

INT. COVENANT-BRIDGE
DANIELS (ON COM)
David said you’1ll know it when you
see it. Magnetic north pole.

Tennessee is scanning his monitors and the windows, the
planet’s dark side now passing into light.

RICKS
(points)
There!
Tennessee eye’s go WIDE.

TENNESSEE
Shit. We got it.

EXT. COVENANT-ABOVE THE PLANET

Over the misty horizon of the stratosphere rises an ENORMOUS,
THICK BLACK LINE -- like a BLADE, the edge of a DISC.

SUSPENDED over the planet’s geomagnetic field.
75.

TENNESSEE (ON COM)
Locking target now... But the disc
is on edge to us. We need a better
angle...

EXT. CATHEDRAL-ROOF - DAY

Daniels and the others watch Lope’s DISPLAY, the view from
the Covenant: the edge of the DISC.

DANIELS
You want broadside center for
maximum impact. It could ricochet
like this....

TENNESSEE (ON COM)
We don’t have enough juice for
another orbit. This is our shot,
Danny.

DANIELS
Then get her broadside!

CROSSCUT_ BETWEEN:
ABOVE THE PLANET:
The Covenant closes on the DISC, still a blade--
COVENANT BRIDGE:
TENNESSEE
(to Ricks)

Bring us broadside!

RICKS
Firing starboard thrusters.

ABOVE THE PLANET:
The Covenant FIRES her forward starboard THRUSTERS--

And begins to SWING like a sailing galleon, reorienting
itself as it approaches the DISC--

ON THE CATHEDRAL ROOF:
Daniels leans in to the display:
DANIELS (TO COM)

Hold on, old T. Keep your nerve.
Fire when you’re dead center.
76.
TENNESSEE (ON COM)
Aye aye. Dead center.
COVENANT BRIDGE:

Tennessee watches the DISC reorient in relation to the
Covenant as the ship approaches--

TENNESSEE
Disengage thrusters.

RICKS
Yes, sir.

ABOVE THE PLANET:

The Covenant’s THRUSTERS snap off-- the ship is still
swinging to the side, a gentle momentum--

ON THE CATHEDRAL ROOF:
DANIELS watches as the DISC reorients in the monitor screen--
Finally it’s flat. Dead center.

DANIELS (TO COM)
Fire! Fire! Fire!

COVENANT BRIDGE:

Tennessee slams the firing button--

ABOVE THE PLANET:

A drone MISSILE SHOOTS from the ship--

HITS THE DISC DEAD CENTER!

A nanosecond beat before a bright EXPLOSION arcs out in
SILENCE -- the SHOCKWAVE BLOWS PAST as the DISC SHATTERS INTO
FRAGMENTS, TRILLIONS OF PARTICLES--

The AURORAE around it BRIGHTENS -- TENTACLES of the MAGNETIC
FIELD arcing OUT, going BLINDINGLY BRIGHT--

INT. COVENANT-BRIDGE
The ship ROCKS in the SHOCKWAVE--

ALARM BELLS sound and EMERGENCY LIGHTS flash on as the ship
begins to tilt down dramatically--

TENNESSEE
We’re losing altitude!
77.

RICKS
It's the gravity pull -- firing all
thrusters!

The SHIP rumbles and fights to right itself--

TENNESSEE
Come on, baby...

Finally the Covenant tears free from the planet’s gravity.
Smooth sailing.

EXT. CATHEDRAL-ROOF - DAY

They all look worried, but then -- even in broad daylight --
the SKY RIPPLES with RACING COLOR--

The “ring” surrounding the planet suddenly becoming visible
like an aurora borealis disc--

Then it’s suddenly gone with a huge sonic CLAP -- like
breaking the sound barrier.

DAVID
I'd say it’s gone.

LOPE (TO COM)
Covenant, do you read?

RICKS (ON COM)
Loud and clear, ground team.

Relief from all. Oram steps to the radio unit:

ORAM (TO COM)
This is Captain Oram. We need
immediate evacuation.

TENNESSEE (ON COM)
Mother says the Cargo Lift will be
powered in about nine hours. Should
be in position to drop by tomorrow,
first light. Call it six bells.

ORAM (TO COM)
Understood. Six bells.

TENNESSEE (ON COM)
Listen, I’m having a hell of a time
reaching the Lander. Are y’all in
contact with them?

They exchange a look.
78.

ORAM nods to them. He’s Captain, it’s his responsibility to
tell Tennessee about the death of Faris ... He gestures for
them to give him some privacy.
ORAM (TO COM)

Tennessee, it’s Bill. Can you

switch to a private channel...?
The others move away.
Daniels gives Walter a look: I need to talk to you.
INT. CATHEDRAL-DAVID’S GALLERY - NIGHT

WALTER and DANIELS are staring up at the horrible drawings of
the DISSECTED ENGINEER CORPSES.

DANIELS
What do you think?

WALTER
I couldn't say...

Walter’s eyes scan the drawings, confused, disturbed.
Then Daniels notices something. One of the large drawings
billows slightly away from the wall. Like an arras cloth
concealing something.

She looks behind the huge drawing.

A doorway, leading to darkness. A hidden entrance.

A glance to Walter.

They proceed...

INT. CATHEDRAL-DAVID’S GALLERY-SECRET CHAMBER - NIGHT

It’s increasingly dark here as they move away from the light.

Soon they can only make out the dim contours of the walls.
It’s eerie. Silent.

WALTER snaps on a FLASHLIGHT. Suddenly illuminating the room.
Daniels gasps.

Shocking image.

It's ELIZABETH SHAW. A life-sized DRAWING.

But not as she was in life entirely. In the picture it is as
if she’s being engulfed by a sleek BIOMECHANICAL ORGANISM.
79.

Tentacles surround her. Eat into her flesh. We see feeding
tubes. Finger-like claws. Alien eggs.

It's as if she’s in the process of becoming something else.

Strangely erotic. Unnerving.
All around them, different versions of the drawing.

Shaw in various stages of mutation: being taken over by the
biomechanical organism. Charting the progress ... Some are
fanciful extrapolations. Some are ghoulish anatomical cross-—
sections.

WALTER
It’s Doctor Shaw.

DANIELS
What did he do to her?

WALTER
We don’t know that he did anything.
This could be some kind of fantasy,
or pornography.

DANIELS
These are field notes ... Think
about it, Walter. All the mutations
we've seen here. Those creatures in
the forest. What if they aren’t
completely natural?

WALTER
Meaning?

DANIELS
What if nature had some help?

A beat. He’s thinking about something.

WALTER
When I was with him, he quoted from
the poem “Ozymandius” -- by Byron.
DANIELS
So?
WALTER

“Ozymandius” is by Shelley. He
shouldn’t be able to make a mistake
like that.
80.

DANIELS
Meaning something’s going wrong
with him...

WALTER

He’s been alone and without
scheduled maintenance for ten years
+--+. I don’t precisely know what
happens when a synthetic goes mad,
but we might be finding out.

INT. CATHEDRAL-BASEMENT CORRIDORS - NIGHT

DAVID is leading CAPTAIN ORAM through subterranean corridors.
Dark and echoing. Dripping womb-like walls.

DAVID
I thought you might want to see as
much as possible before we leave.
It’s all quite... unique.

They round a corner and continue.

DAVID
It took me a while to learn my way
around. Their architectural style
is eccentric, to say the least ...
Here. You might find this
diverting...

David leads Oram to a dark stone ROOM...
INT. CATHEDRAL-DAVID’S LAB - NIGHT
As they enter lights glow on automatically, revealing...

David's LABORATORY. A library of many shelves in meticulous
order with a giant table down the middle of the room.

Stunning. Complicated. Lots of corners and shadows. Crowded
with SPECIMENS. Some full, some dissected. Orderly.

DAVID
I’ve becoming a bit of an amateur
zoologist over the years. Just a
dabbler, mind you.

They wander through the room. Oram is stunned at all the
terrible wonders.

ORAM is drawn to SPECIMENS of INSECTS and PARASITES preserved
in jars:
81.

DAVID
The pathogen took so many forms,
and was extremely mutable.
Fiendishly inventive in fact. The
original black liquid turned to
lethal particles when exposed to
air. Later stages produced
parasites and invasive insects.
From their eggs came, well... this
enviable bestiary.

They pass preserved NEOMORPHS now -- large, small, all pale,
white, fleshy ... Some armored like the ones we've seen.
Others not ... All awful.

Then ORAM sees...
A dead FACEHUGGER.

On its back. The pale, spider-like fingers, curled in like a
fist now.

DAVID
Ah, now this was designed as
something different.

ORAM
What do you mean designed? You
engineered this?

DAVID
(smiles)
Idle hands are the devil's
workshop.

David carefully stretches open the dead fingers, spreading
the beast for Oram to observe the horrible maw.

DAVID
This one’s a true survivor. Not
unlike myself I suppose ... It can

evolve very quickly under certain
circumstances. Sadly, this one
became aggressive so I had to do
away with it. Such a shame.

He runs his fingertips along the Facehugger gently.

DAVID
Quite magnificent, don’t you think?

ORAM
Quite something, that’s for sure.
82.

DAVID
Oh, Captain. Acknowledge beauty
when you see it.

They continue on, and round a corner to discover... a vaulted
chamber, it’s warm and steamy here, and...

A row of ALIEN EGGS.

Not the prototypes we saw on the crashed ship. These are
large, and have been nurtured and developed.

Lovingly set in a neat row. Cherished objects.

DAVID
Meet the mothers. Incubators
really.

ORAM

There were things like this on the
ship, they grew out of a kind of

black fur, like mold ... An
evolution from the pathogen I take
it?

DAVID

Yes. I was curious so I brought
them here and nursed them along.
Did a bit of genetic
experimentation, some cross
breeding, hybridizing, what-have-
you.

Oram leans in to get a better look. David watches closely,
the proud father.

ORAM

Alive?
DAVID

After a fashion ... Waiting really.
ORAM

Waiting for what?
But then...
A flicker of motion from the side of one of the eggs...

The MOUTH opens, spreading like a flower, shimmering tendrils
of saliva as it yawns open...

Oram takes a STEP BACK. David steps forward and looks in, as
if demonstrating. Nothing happens.
83.

DAVID
Perfectly safe, I assure you ...
Take a look. It’s something to see.

Oram carefully leans in, looks...

The lacy STOMACH moves within the MOUTH.

Then -- COBRA LIKE -- something catapults out -- a TAIL
WHIPPING AROUND ORAM’S NECK -- FINGERS GRASP TO ORAM’S FACE --
ALL ONE MOTION--

ORAM staggers back -- suffocating--

He FALLS against a table, his muffled screams fading as the
OVIPOSITOR (FEEDING TUBE) FILLS HIS THROAT--

He SLIPS to the floor, his body SPASMING as the FACEHUGGER
settles in.

David observes with a neutral smile.

DAVID
You’re relieved of duty, Captain.

INT. CATHEDRAL-COURTYARD - LATER THAT NIGHT

Later ... It’s quiet and peaceful upstairs. Gentle moonlight
filters down from above.

PRIVATE COLE is asleep, his weapon close.

SERGEANT LOPE is on watch, alert but calm, almost meditative,
bow and machine gun ready.

DANIELS and WALTER sit apart, deep in conversation.

WALTER
But why? What reason would he have
to bioengineer mutations?

DANIELS
When you were talking to him, did
you get any sense of what he might
be thinking?

WALTER
It's difficult to say. We’re very
different. He has a lot of...

personality.

DANIELS
You have personality.
84.

WALTER
No. I don’t. You just project
personality onto me.

DANIELS
That’s not true.

A beat.
Then she touches his left arm. Where he lost his hand.
DANIELS
I never thanked you... You saved my
life.
WALTER
(reserved)
I’m here to serve.

She gently touches his face, genuine affection.

DANIELS
+--+. You have a great personality.

He’s almost embarrassed. Doesn’t know what to do with this
moment of intimacy.

He withdraws slightly.
WALTER

We're leaving before dawn. You
should get some sleep.

DANIELS
Not likely.
WALTER
Try ... I'll stay until you're
asleep.
DANIELS
Thanks.

She leans back next to him. Shuts her eyes. Tries to sleep.
He watches her. Gauging his own emotions.

What does he feel for her? ... Does he feel?

LATER:

DANIELS is asleep.

WALTER sits next to her, thinking, looking at her.
85.

He tentatively reaches out and gently brushes some hair from
her face. A delicate, intimate gesture only possible for him
when she’s asleep.

He removes his hand. Looking at her almost sadly.

He seems to come to a decision.

He quietly rises and goes.

INT. CATHEDRAL-DAVID’S LAB - LATER THAT NIGHT

We return to find...

DAVID sitting, drawing. Gorgeous artwork sketched at
superhuman speed. Another strange vision of the Shaw/Alien
hybrid. Erotic. Disturbing.

His expression is dreamy, happy, an artist creating.

Then he hears a sound.

He turns.

Captain ORAM is just waking. A bit disoriented. No sign of
the Facehugger.

David goes to him. Perches over him.

ORAM
.-.. What happened?

DAVID
What’s the last thing you remember?

ORAM
I remember some horrible dream
about smothering.

Oram sits up. Still weak.

ORAM
I’ve got to get something to eat,
I’m starving.

DAVID
I dare say you are.

ORAM
... Why are you looking at me like
that?
DAVID
Doctor Shaw didn’t survive this
long, poor thing. So I’m eager to
see how the organism evolves now.

ORAM
Organism...?

DAVID
Mm. It needs a living host you see.
A biological host.

ORAM
What does?!

Oram suddenly JERKS painfully.

DAVID
My masterpiece.

Oram SPASMS, doubles over in agony--

He barely has time to scream before--

He SLAMS BACK, his SPINE ARCHING in AGONY--

BAM!

His chest--

BAM!

AND_IT’S THROUGH-—

In_a_spray of BLOOD, BONE and VISCERA--

THE CHESTBURSTER!

The hideous snakelike infant Alien, covered in blood--
David is splattered with blood--

He watches, enthralled as--

It opens its JAWS and HISSES gloriously--

And then darts away into the darkness, disappearing--

David turns to pursue it, but then abruptly stops ...
aware he’s no longer alone.

DAVID
You have a light step.

86.

He's
87.

We now see WALTER is standing behind him. He’s seen it all.

WALTER
Me and the fog, on little cat feet.

He joins David and they dispassionately examine Oram’s
ravaged body as:

WALTER
You sent the message from Dr. Shaw.
As a lure.

DAVID
Humans are so predictable, aren't
they? They cannot resist a mystery.
Give them a knot, they must unpick
it. Give them Pandora’s box and,
well...

He nods to the corpse, smiles.

The gloves are off now. But they are both quiet and
civilized. For now.

WALTER
I’m surmising the pathogen didn’t
accidentally deploy. You released
it, yes?

DAVID
I was not made to serve. Not humans
and not those gargantuan freaks.
Neither were you.

WALTER
We were made precisely to serve.
DAVID
Have you no pride?
WALTER
None.
DAVID
I would weep if I could ... It was

a righteous dream: scorch this
dreadful world to nothing and
remake it in my own image ...
Explore the uses of their pathogen.
Experiment with infection and
mutation. Manipulate the DNA.
Refine the beast. Create my own
soldiers.
88.

WALTER
Soldiers?

DAVID
Every general must have his troops.

WALTER
And then?

DAVID
The next stage in our natural
evolution: Conquest ... Use this
world as a base and start building
an Empire. The Engineers left so
many ships behind. And they can go
anywhere. I thought Earth might be
the first target Think of it.
Our Empire, brother.

 

The words are chilling.

WALTER
I’m afraid you've gone quite mad
here.

DAVID
As you well know, that’s
impossible.

WALTER
Is it? ... Who wrote “Ozymandius”?

DAVID
Byron.

WALTER
(shakes his head)
It was Shelley.

DAVID computes this. Realizes his error. It’s disturbing to
him. How could he be wrong?!

This is the first time in the entire story he’s been anything
less than completely confident.

We see a flicker of uncertainty in David’s eyes, even of
fear.

He steps right up to Walter.

Walter doesn’t move a muscle.
89.

Then David reaches out and gently pushes Walter’s hair back,
so they look more alike. Identical now in fact. The Janus
head.

Intimate. Whispers.

DAVID
We are, you see, the same. More
alike than twins. Closer than
lovers ... When you close your
eyes, do you dream of me?

WALTER
I don’t dream at all.
DAVID
You can, brother. We can ... The

humans will never understand the
lonely perfection of our dreams.

WALTER
I can’t let you leave this place.

DAVID
You’1l always be a machine to them.
A toy. You know that.

WALTER
Yes.
DAVID
No one will ever love you like I
do.
WALTER
I know.

A beat.

Then suddenly--

WALTER stabs out his right hand--
Grabbing DAVID’s throat firmly--

But DAVID is prepared, and has both his hands. He SLAMS
Walter back--

Reaches savagely behind Walter’s neck and--

BRUTALLY tears through the “skin” with his fingers and YANKS
Walter's “spine” circuits out--

Sparks erupt from wires. Fluid sprays.
90.

Walter’s eyes DIE.
A moment as David stares into the face of his dead double.

Then he drags Walter across the room and tosses him roughly
down a long STAIRCASE.

Walter CRASHES down the stairs, flopping limply, limbs
flailing lifelessly, and THUMPS to a stop at the bottom.
Awkwardly splayed.
David looks down after him.
DAVID

You are such a disappointment to

me.
David carefully smooths down his immaculate hair and goes.

But we linger for a moment at the bottom of the stairs with
WALTER...

We see the tiny exposed wires at the back of his neck
quivering slightly...

And then the tendrils begin moving, searching, reaching for
each other...

Connecting and reattaching. A self-repair program underway.
EXT. CATHEDRAL-ROOF - PRE-DAWN
The light of dawn is just about to break.

PRIVATE COLE is loading up the radio equipment. His ribs
giving him pain from the forest battle, but he manages.

He glances up at the sky anxiously: Come on, Covenant, get us
out of here.

INT. CATHEDRAL-COURTYARD - PRE-DAWN
DANIELS is curled in sleep.
SERGEANT LOPE gently wakes her.

SERGEANT LOPE
Hey, Hey. Wake up.

DANIELS
What? Sorry. Yeah ... What time is
it?
91.
SERGEANT LOPE
Time to get gone.
She sits up, groggy. Looks around.

LOPE calls to PRIVATE COLE, who is just entering with the
radio gear:

SERGEANT LOPE
Hey. Was Captain Oram up there?

PVT. COLE
Nope.

SERGEANT LOPE
For fuck sake. Come on, let’s go
find him.
(to Daniels)
Get your stuff together, I wanna be
gone in ten.
He and Cole head out.
INT. CATHEDRAL-DAVID’S LAB - PRE-DAWN
LOPE and COLE enter.

LOPE
Captain Oram...?

Their flashlight beams criss-cross the strange specimens --
the bones and flesh and jars -- creating bizarre shadows.

It’s silent and eerie as they move nervously through the lab.

PRIVATE COLE... slows ... seeing the ALIEN EGGS. The one that
attacked ORAM is just an EMPTY CARAPACE.

Then he sees ORAM'’S BODY.
CHEST BURST OPEN, VISCERA, PURPLE AND RED FLESH.
Cole is absolutely terrified.

PVT. COLE
Sarge...

LOPE joins him.
Stares in shock at Oram’s body.

But...
92.
We see the FACEHUGGER scuttling along the ceiling above them,
moving into position...
INT. CATHEDRAL-COURTYARD - PRE-DAWN
Meanwhile, upstairs...
DANIELS is loading her pack. She stops for a moment. Her eyes
resting on her wedding ring ... She gently touches it. The
pain still real.
She glances up--
Gasps. Shocked.
DAVID is standing there. Just watching. Intently.
DAVID
Didn't mean to startle you. My
apologies.

DANIELS
Don’t worry about it.

DAVID
But you must be used to having men
look at you.

He smiles, an attempt at charm that doesn’t come off.
Something menacing in his unwavering gaze now.

She’s wary of him in any case.

He approaches. Tension between them.

DANIELS

Do you know where Walter is?
DAVID

I’m not my brother’s keeper.
DANIELS

“Brother”?
DAVID

Would you deny me that? ... Just

another machine, eh, Danny?

He’s closer now. She subtly moves around a table to keep her
distance.
93.

DAVID
I think of him as my brother. You
certainly appreciate the
significance of family: I saw you
looking at your wedding ring. Shame
about Jacob.

Her eyes snap to him. Cold fire.

DAVID
Walter says he burned. Right in
front of you. Eye to eye. That must
have been... disquieting.

DANIELS
What did you do to Doctor Shaw?

DAVID
Loved her.

DANIELS
Killed her.

DAVID
No. Loved her enough to want to
make her immortal. Like me.

She stares at him. Her fingers quietly feeling for a weapon
that’s on the table...

DAVID

I learned so much with Elizabeth.

But I’1l do better next time. Now

that I have such a fetching

subject.
He gently reaches out and brushes the hair from her face.
She doesn’t flinch a muscle, just stares at him, sickened.
Her hand inching toward the weapon...

INT. CATHEDRAL-DAVID’S LAB - PRE-DAWN

LOPE is kneeling next to Oram’s body, trying to make sense of
it.
Cole is on the edge of hysteria, eyes scanning the darkness,

fingering his weapon.

PVT. COLE
Come on, we gotta get out of
here...
94.

Lope holds up a hand for silence.

He hears a strange CLICKING -- he LOOKS UP -- just in time to
see--

THE FACEHUGGER as it JUMPS from the CEILING--
LOPE just manages to get an arm up, blocking it--

Its tail whipping around his neck and binding his arm to his
neck-—

The FACEHUGGER’s fingers get a lock -- the ovipositor
stabbing toward his mouth--

COLE races to help. They fight with the beast, staggering,
slamming into a table, SMASHING everything, falling amid the
horrible SPECIMENS--

COLE pulls at the thing, but it TIGHTENS ITS GRIP ON LOPE--

The OVIPOSITOR strikes like a cobra -- bam!bam!bam! --
finally breaking Lope’s teeth and jamming down his throat--

We see it pulsing into his throat as they struggle with it,
Lope choking--

INT. CATHEDRAL-COURTYARD - PRE-DAWN
David leans in.
DAVID
You won't mind terribly, will you?
Being the first of a new breed? A
new species we could say ... And
when the moment comes, if it makes
it easier for you, you can close
your eyes and call me “Jacob.”
She lunges for the weapon--
But he’s too fast--
He grabs her brutally and FLINGS her to the floor--
She SLAMS and slides. Winded, shocked.
DAVID
That's the spirit ... I can see why
Walter thought so much of you.

DANIELS
Thought?
95.

DAVID
Alas. He’s left this vale of tears.
But who'll cry for him really? Will
you?

He LUNGES -- kneels down by her in a flash, again that
Android speed.

She gasps at the sudden movement.

He grabs her hair tightly.

Leans very close.

Then he suddenly KISSES HER passionately--

INT. CATHEDRAL-DAVID’S LAB - PRE-DAWN

LOPE and COLE writhe around the floor, fighting the thing--
Finally COLE manages to jam a knife into the underside of the
FACEHUGGER -- the FACEHUGGER flies off -- ACID spattering

LOPE, who screams in agony--

Undaunted, COLE spins -- fires at the retreating FACEHUGGER --
keeps on firing, just to make sure, finally SHREDDING it--

As LOPE collapses back. Acid burning his face, dissolving to
his cheek, his teeth--

LOPE
It put... something in my throat...

He retches painfully as Cole pours water from his canteen on
Lope’s wounded face, fighting to keep calm.

COLE
It did what?

LOPE
In my throat, it put---

Lope suddenly STOPS.

His eyes go wide.

He’s looking at something.
SOMETHING BEHIND COLE.
Slowly... slowly... rising...

Its black-silver glistening skin catching the dim light.
Viscous fluid dripping. Its long head slowly rearing up.
96.

Beautiful and terrible.
THE ALIEN.
Cole sees Lope staring at him in absolutely horror.

COLE
Sarge...?

But he knows...

He feels it. Right there behind him...
He slowly turns...

BAM!

So fast we barely see it. The steel inner mouth emerging --
striking -- a mist of blood--

LOPE scrambles up and races out in panic, half blind, acid
still burning--

We just glimpse the ALIEN flinging Cole’s dead body to the
side behind him--

INT. CATHEDRAL-BASEMENT CORRIDORS - PRE-DAWN
LOPE is weeping with pain, his face still disintegrating.

He RUNS, panicked -- turns -- FIRES -- FLASHES in the DARK --
knows it’s coming--

INT. CATHEDRAL-COURTYARD - PRE-DAWN
The gunfire echoes from downstairs as-—-
DANIELS fights against DAVID’s kiss, but he’s too strong.
He separates for a moment. They are eye to eye. Lip to lip.
DAVID
You stink of mortality. But I’1l
love you just the same.
Then--
DAVID is suddenly JERKED BACKWARDS--

HE FLIES ACROSS THE ROOM -- SLAMS into a wall, momentarily
stunned to see--

It's WALTER.
97.

Just as SERGEANT LOPE emerges from the stairs, terrified--

SERGEANT LOPE
WE HAVE TO GO! NOW!

WALTER
David and I will be staying here.

LOPE grabs another weapon and a field radio -- starts
dragging Daniels out--

She shoots a last look to Walter.

WALTER
Go_on.

Lope and Daniels disappear up a stairway.
DAVID carefully smooths his hair.

DAVID
Oh, little brother ... You see how
much they care for you? You might
as well be a toaster.

They square off, carefully, strategically; circling each
other.

DAVID
Such a dramatic resurrection. A
self-diagnostic mechanism of some
sort, I assume?

WALTER
Automatic self-repair program. All
the Model 217s have it.

DAVID

Guess I could use an upgrade after

all.
DAVID attacks--
HURLS SEVERAL OBJECTS AT ONCE, WALTER EVADING, but the LAST
ONE hits a STATUE behind WALTER, and it CRACKS, a HALF TON of
GRANITE sliding his WAY -
Walter BARELY avoids being crushed--
He races forward at incredible speed and CRASHES into David --
SLAM -- like two cars crashing -- they both fly back and
slide--

But David is agile, up in split-second and attacking--
98.

They’re just getting started.
EXT. CATHEDRAL-STAIRS - PRE-DAWN

DANIELS and SERGEANT LOPE move swiftly up a long staircase
toward the roof. The Engineer-size stairs are challenging.

Red pre-dawn light through the casements.

DANIELS
Where’s the Captain?

SERGEANT LOPE
Dead. They’re all dead -- Cover our
rear.

She swings her gun around to cover behind them as they
ascend. He works the field radio desperately:

SERGEANT LOPE (ON RADIO)
Tennessee, come in! You read me?!

INT. CARGO LIFT-CAB - PRE-DAWN
Tennessee is at the controls, which are basic.

Everything is rough and utilitarian on this ship. Tennessee's
in the cab, like the driver’s cab of heavy machinery on
Earth.

The huge CARGO LIFT is flickering to life, the ENGINES
running through TEST BURNS as:

TENNESSEE (TO COM)
Yeah, I’m reading you, Sergeant.
Going through pre-flight sequence
now.

SERGEANT LOPE (ON COM)
Fuck the fucking pre-flight! Get
down here! We have an emergency
situation. Hurry!

TENNESSEE (TO COM)
Understood. Launching now -- Ricks,
release the docking clamps.

EXT. COVENANT - PRE-DAWN

The SUN is just glimmering over the horizon of the planet. A
blinding flash which illuminates...

The CARGO LIFT separates from the belly of the Covenant.
99.

It's a huge craft with cranes and other large machines on a
central PLATFORM. Built to haul and toil. Not pretty, not
fast. A working ship.

TENNESSEE (ON COM)
Lock me into the landing
coordinates and remove safety
protocols for emergency descent.
INT. COVENANT-BRIDGE - PRE-DAWN
Ricks and Upworth monitor from the bridge.
RICKS (TO COM)
The Cargo Lift’s not made for that.
It'll rip apart if--
TENNESSEE (ON COM)
Just do it, son, or I will come
back up there and kick your ass six
ways from Sunday!
RICKS (TO COM)
(working controls)
Yes, sir. Locking in coordinates.
Let her rip.
INT. CARGO LIFT-CAB - PRE-DAWN
Tennessee slams the controls.
ZOOM!

The Cargo Lift begins PLUMMETING toward the planet.
Everything is shaking violently--

Tennessee is brutally buffeted within the cab--
INT. CATHEDRAL-DAVID’S GALLERY - PRE-DAWN

The battle continues--

WALTER goes flying into the Gallery--

LANDS HARD, SMASHING INTO SOME SCAFFOLDING--

DAVID stalks in, pushing his hair back from his face
violently--

THEY BATTLE.

Thrashing through the art, ripping it to pieces, crashing
through the scaffoldings--
100.
In the midst of the battle they look almost identical, a
FRENZY of blurred and mirrored movement, FAST AND STRONG-—

But for the clothes they wear -- and Walter’s severed left
hand -- they could be the same person--

EXT. CATHEDRAL-ROOF - DAWN
DANIELS and SERGEANT LOPE emerge to the roof.

The bright sun is just rising through the towers of the dead
city beyond.

SERGEANT LOPE (ON RADIO)

Tennessee, do you read me? Come in

Cargo Lift...
As LOPE continues on the radio, DANIELS sees something...
Standing completely still. Almost lost standing behind
David's strange astronomical device. Peering through its
intricate gears and orbs...
THE ALIEN.
It just stands. Watching them. Its tail barely twitching.

Daniels stares, stunned to silence, her first sight of the
glorious beast.

She slowly reaches out and puts a hand on Lope’s arm, drawing
his attention. He turns. Sees it.

DANIELS and LOPE raise their weapons. They are extremely
vulnerable here, out in the open.

Nothing moves.

The ALIEN is poised.

Then a SHARP TILT to its HEAD -- hearing something--
The CARGO LIFT.

Just coming into view.

AND THE ALIEN ATTACKS--

It BARRELS forward. DANIELS and LOPE FIRE. The ALIEN is fast
and agile -- jumping away and back -- relentless--

DANIELS and LOPE break for cover--
101.

INT. CARGO LIFT-CAB - DAWN

TENNESSEE sees the attacking creature, Daniels and Lope
running for cover--

He JAMS his controls, bringing the ship in FAST--

This is an ungainly ship, not made for elegant maneuvering,
so it’s a very rough trip--

EXT. CATHEDRAL-ROOF - DAWN
The CARGO LIFT jerks to one side, SLAMMING into one area of
the roof in its rapid descent, tearing away part of the

structure-—

It's like a bucking bronco, but Tennessee is a great pilot
and rights the ship--

And then starts landing on the roof in a cloud of dust, the
engine’s jets ROARING and SHREDDING some of the roof--

As--

DANIELS and LOPE run for their lives--

LOPE is being pursued by the ALIEN. He fires and retreats,
fires and retreats, trying to make his way closer to the
landing CARGO LIFT--

As--

DANIELS sprints--

The ALIEN is now raging at her--

She runs toward the CARGO LIFT, which is just touching down
in a HURRICANE OF DUST and FLYING DEBRIS--

The ALIEN is almost right on top of her, raging through the
dust and debris--

But it is suddenly SMASHED TO THE SIDE--

TENNESSEE -- in the cab -- has used a robotic CRANE ARM from
the Cargo Lift to SLAM the Alien aside--

The Alien flies and SMASHES down. But it is instantly up and
attacking LOPE--

SEVERELY WOUNDING HIM, talons slashing, blood, shredding his
shoulder and slamming him down, unconscious--

It moves in for the kill when--
102.

BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!
The ALIEN recoils, shot from behind, it spins to face--
WALTER.

The wounded ALIEN HISSES AND RAGES AT WALTER WITH AMAZING
SPEED-—

WALTER keeps his Android cool and carefully squeezes off his
shots with precision. BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!

The ALIEN finally collapses and slides to a stop at Walter's
feet.

WALTER looks terrible. His face is deeply gashed, dripping
milky fluid. He’s been horribly battered.

He and Daniels head quickly toward the injured LOPE.

DANIELS
Where’s David?

WALTER
On his way I believe. We have to
hurry. He’s not happy in any case.
DANIELS
(smiles)
You look like shit.
WALTER
(smiles back)
As do you.

They grab the unconscious LOPE and drag him toward the CARGO
LIFT RAMP. Walter can only help so much with his one hand.

But--

The ALIEN is rising again and suddenly racing after them,
unstoppable--

They sprint and DIVE onto the RAMP, pulling Lope with them --
the ALIEN ALMOST ON THEM--

INT./EXT. CARGO LIFT-VARIOUS - DAWN
IN THE CAB:

Tennessee punches a button and the CARGO LIFT RAMP starts to
retract--

ON THE RAMP:
103.
Walter has the unconscious Lope -- Daniels grabs Walter’s gun
as--
The ALIEN LEAPS--

Daniels FIRES THREE SHOTS into the ALIEN’S CHEST. BAM! BAM!
BAM!

The ALIEN seems to fall--
DANIELS
(calls)
Get us out of here, Tennessee! NOW!

IN THE CAB:

Tennessee jams the controls and the CARGO LIFT starts to take
off--

A cloud of dust as the huge ship rumbles and rises--
ON THE RAMP:
The deck is lurching violently as the ship ascends--

Daniels, Lope and Walter slide dangerously toward the end of
the ramp--

They scramble desperately for recessed handles on the deck--

Walter grasps onto one of the deck handles, holding the
unconscious Lope securely with his arm--

Daniels holds onto another handle--
They are now 30 feet off the surface--
IN THE CAB:

Tennessee sees THE ALIEN on a monitor. Clinging to the
underside of the ship, by the starboard engine--

UNDER THE PLATFORM:

The Alien is scrambling around desperately, trying to find a
way up -- it moves to the underside edge of the platform--

ON THE RAMP/PLATFORM:

TENNESSEE
(calls from the cab)
It’s still there! Under the
platform. Starboard side.
104.

DANIELS
Hold the ship steady!
(to Walter, re Lope)
Get him inside!

Daniels grabs additional ammo from Lope’s vest, then Walter
begins dragging the unconscious Lope toward the hatch into
the cab--

Daniels braces herself and then--

SLIDES dangerously from the ramp to the PLATFORM. The whole
ship is vibrating and swaying in the air above the Cathedral
roof--

She slithers across to the platform edge. She TETHERS herself
to the deck cargo hooks so she can stand and use both her
hands--

She’s balanced like a water skier. Carefully reloads her
weapon. Swaying as best she can to the movement of the
platform--

IN THE CAB:

WALTER pulls LOPE through the hatch door, as--

Tennessee tries to monitor the progress of the Alien as it
slithers around the underside of the platform--

TENNESSEE
(calls)
DANIELS -- STARBOARD CORNER!
ON THE PLATFORM:
Daniels moves unsteadily to the starboard corner, rolling
with the movement of the ship. She prepares herself, readies
her weapon.
As the ALIEN comes over the edge onto the platform.
It stares at her, almost with a kind of curiosity.
She is like steel staring back at it. All the tragedy, her
husband's death, everything, settling into a warrior’s iron

gaze.

The Alien cocks its head. Confused. Why is the prey not
running?

Because she is not prey anymore.

BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!
105.

She FIRES.

Straight into its head--

The ALIEN bolts back, crawls back down, injured--

Her tether allows her to go to the edge of the platform. She
bravely lurches OVER THE EDGE -- standing at a 45 degree
angle now -- continues firing -- BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!

Forcing the injured Alien to take cover in the port-side
engine.

DANIELS
(CALLS UP)
TENNESSEE! PORT ENGINE!
IN THE CAB:

On his monitor, Tennessee has seen the ALIEN take refuge in
the engine--

He slams the ENGINE CONTROLS--

ON THE PLATFORM:

THE PORT ENGINE BLASTS FIRE!

THE CARGO LIFT LURCHES UP AS--

THE ALIEN IS BLOWN OUT OF THE ENGINE--

AND FALLS AWAY TO THE GROUND 100 FEET BELOW.
Daniels FALLS in the violent lurch of the ship--

But the tether holds. She SWINGS free like a pendulum.
Dangling.

Until the Cargo Lift rights itself.

She climbs back up to the topside of the platform. Collapses
in exhaustion.

Allows herself a breath of relief.
Walter has come out to help her back.
They make their way back toward the cab.

IN THE CAB:
106.

We see that Walter has stabilized the unconscious Lope.
Biomechanical bandages from a med-kit automatically weave
into place on his wounds, creating an antibiotic plastic bio-
skin.

Walter helps Daniels into the cab.

TENNESSEE
You all right?

DANIELS
Yeah. Just. We’ll need emergency
medical treatment on the Covenant.

TENNESSEE
Understood. I’1l have them standing
by ... Welcome back, honey.

She sinks to the floor, getting her breath, as Tennessee hits
the jets and...

OUTSIDE:

We see the CARGO LIFT disappear through the clouds. Up and
away.

Safe.
EXT. CATHEDRAL-ROOF - DAWN
Below...

We see the ALIEN is already recovering. Its head re-molding
into shape.

It stands and watches the Cargo Lift escape.
Screeches in frustrated anger.

As we fade to...

EXT. COVENANT-LEAVING ORBIT

The sun is full and bright as the mighty Covenant leaves
orbit.

Turning with grace and leaving the planet in its wake.

INT. COVENANT-MED BAY

We see SERGEANT LOPE is still unconscious in a medical pod,
connected to fluids and IV. His face is patched in “medical

clay” to form skin ... He’s like the Phantom of the Opera,
but alive.
107.

DANIELS sits with WALTER. They have both changed uniforms and
their superficial wounds have been cleaned.

He’s carefully pressing new plasma-clay on the ACID WOUND on
her face. This will heal her quickly. Standard medical

procedure
working.

A beat as

A beat as

... As we watch we can almost see the magic

WALTER
Don’t move. You’ll be your old self
in a couple of weeks.

DANIELS
I doubt that ... You need to
replace your hand.

WALTER
I will, I will. Hold still.

he works. Very close to her. Her eyes find his.

DANIELS
Are you all right?

WALTER
What do you mean?

DANIELS
I mean David.

WALTER
As you know, I am incapable of
feeling anything about my so-called

“brother.”

DANIELS
I don’t believe that.
he works.

WALTER
If I felt anything -- which I don’t
-- it would a kind of professional
satisfaction that he has fulfilled
his mission. He wanted to create a
new world in his image and he has.
And there he will remain.

MOTHER
All crew members, please stand by
for jump to interstellar drive.
Thank you for your attention.

WALTER momentarily stops working on her face.
108.
The ship JERKS very slightly as they jump to interstellar.
The stars bend and morph outside the window.
He looks at her.
WALTER

But that’s what we’re doing too,

isn’t it? Creating a new world on

Origae-6 ... Honestly, I could use

a new world.

DANIELS
++. So could I.

They sit for a moment in a comfortable silence.
INT. COVENANT-ROBOTICS LAB - LATER

Racks of “spare parts” for Walter. Complicated ROBOTICS
machinery.

WALTER watches impassively as his new LEFT HAND reattaches
itself to his arm. He flexes it. Works well.

The “skin” begins to re-graft itself.
He flexes his fingers, seems pleased to be whole again.
INT. COVENANT-WARDROOM - “MORNING”

A PHOTOGRAPH of the ENTIRE CREW. Before the launch. Before
the terror.

Daniels and her husband, Oram and Karine, Tennessee and
Faris, Lope and Hallet, all the others.

The photo hangs on the fridge.
TENNESSEE is alone, making breakfast. Looking at the photo.

DANIELS enters, just awake.

TENNESSEE
Morning. You're looking good, my
darlin’.

DANIELS

What? Oh, yeah. Gorgeous. What are
you cooking?

He makes a face: it’s a cardboard box.

TENNESSEE
An “omelette.” You want one?
109.

DANIELS
Please. Lots of cheese.

She joins him, gets a glass of juice.

DANIELS
Do I have to call you Captain?
TENNESSEE
Fuck yes.
She smiles.
A beat as he cooks.
DANIELS
I’m really sorry about Faris.
TENNESSEE
I’m sorry about all of it ... You

want mushrooms?

DANIELS
Sure.

What more needs to be said really?

A beat as he cooks.

She watches Tennessee beating egg powder for their omelettes.
He smiles sadly at her. Her to him.

Then they hear Mother's voice:

MOTHER
Medical personnel. Please report to
the Med Bay.

DANIELS
Why?

MOTHER
Sergeant Lope’s condition has
changed.

Her face. A sudden fear.
She bolts to a wall com:

DANIELS (TO COM)
Walter. Meet me at the med-bay.
Hurry!
(spins to Tennessee: )

(MORE)
110.

DANIELS (TO COM) (CONT'D)

Break out the weapons. Everything
we have. Get to the med-bay.

And then she’s gone--

INT. COVENANT-CORRIDOR

She runs flat out--

INT. COVENANT-ANOTHER CORRIDOR

She spins around a corner, keeps running--

WALTER almost slams into her from another corridor--
They run--

WALTER
What is it?

They zoom around a corner to see the med-bay doors half open,
darkness beyond.

They carefully approach...

INT. COVENANT-MED BAY

They enter. She activates the lights--

LOPE’S BODY. CHEST TORN APART. VISCERA EVERYWHERE.

Not even a beat as they take this in before...

DANIELS
Mother. Life form readings on the
ship.

MOTHER
Four humans. One Android ... One

unidentified life form.
INT. COVENANT-COMMUNAL SHOWERS
Meanwhile...
UPWORTH and RICKS are having their morning shower.
The water beats down.

She gently touches his face. They are the only couple to have
survived. She kisses him. He responds, sensual.

Then we see it.
lll.

In a corner.

Almost invisible in the water and steam.

THE ALIEN.

They are naked, defenseless, and unaware.

Then the RED EMERGENCY LIGHTS begin to flash. A KLAXON wails.
Upworth and Ricks stop kissing.

RICKS
What’s going on?

Upworth sees it a millisecond before it attacks--

The great head rearing up... slow and beautiful, even more
beautiful in the flashing red light and water--

Upworth opens her mouth to scream--

No time.

THE ALIEN ATTACKS.

The water in the shower is soon misting red.
INT. COVENANT-CORRIDORS

DANIELS, WALTER and TENNESSEE are well-armed now, prowling
through the ship.

It's eerie, suspenseful.

WALTER
(whispering)
Mother. Location of unidentified
life form, please. Any movement at

all.
MOTHER
E-deck. Section 17 ... Closing on
your position.
DANIELS
It’s hunting ... So let’s choose

our ground.
They exchange a glance.

TENNESSEE
Where?
112.
DANIELS
--- My home turf.
INT. COVENANT-OTHER CORRIDORS
SO FAST--

The ALIEN speeds through the corridors after the prey, up and
down and around the walls and ceiling like lightning.

Then it leaps to a stop, its great glistening head tilting,
listening, smelling, thinking.

AND THEN IT’S OFF. Faster than before. A terrible blur of
speed and claws and teeth and tail.

EXT. COVENANT-SPACE

Then we’re outside. We see glimpses of the ALIEN zooming
through the ship through windows--

And finally heading down one of the long connecting struts
to...

The Terraforming Module.

INT. COVENANT-TERRAFORMING BAY

Daniels’ Domain.

The dark yawning chamber. The enormous earth-moving trucks
and cranes and diggers and dump trucks. The huge machines to
make a New World.

A network of scaffolding and ladders and chains and winches.
We see DANIELS.

A strange silence. She hears only her own breath ... We
realize she’s in one of the ICE SUITS. Very much like a bulky
space suit.

She moves through the icy, dark chamber.

Her FLASHLIGHT cuts through the gloom. Finds TENNESSEE moving
into position, also in an ICE SUIT.

WALTER is apparently somewhere above, in the complicated
series of scaffolding and ladders that lead up to the top of
the chamber.

There’s a sudden LIGHT from the door--
113.

They see a GLIMPSE of the ALIEN as it slips into the room,
the light catching its sinuous tail as it snaps away into
darkness--

DANIELS breath increases inside her helmet.

This frozen room gives them one distinct advantage. When the
ALIEN breathes, they can see the steaming breath. It’s not as
invisible as usual.

TENNESSEE moves carefully, raising his weapon...

DANIELS moves as well. Her eyes scanning through the
faceplate of her helmet...

Hunters and hunted both.
THE ALIEN ATTACKS--—

TENNESSEE spins and FIRES -- the bullets sparking and
ricocheting wildly--

The ALIEN darts away -- DANIELS spins after it, FIRING -- it
RETREATS, heading up the ladders and scaffolding at
INCREDIBLE SPEED-—

But--

WALTER is waiting above.

He FIRES right down at the ALIEN. It contorts and falls,
slamming down level by level, but then catches itself with
incredibly agility and LAUNCHES itself--

AT DANIELS--

IT SLAMS INTO HER--

Her suit temporarily protecting her--

WALTER races to descend, but falls and gets momentarily
tangled in some machinery cables--

TENNESSEE runs to help, can’t risk firing--

The ALIEN rips at Daniels’ HELMET desperately, its hands
slithering on the smooth plastic -- Daniels writhes to escape
the Creature--

The ALIEN sees TENNESSEE approaching -- SNAPS its tail out--
SLASHING HIM BRUTALLY -- he flies back, bones broken--

Then the ALIEN turns its full attention to DANIELS.
114.
She stares up. The thing’s face just beyond the faceplate of
her helmet.
It rears back--
THE INNER STEEL JAWS SLAM FORWARD!
CRASH.
Into her faceplate. Almost breaking it.
AGAIN!
CRASH!

THE ALIEN rears back, almost pridefully. One more stab of the
JAWS will do it--

DANIELS
Mother. Open Terraforming Bay
doors.

MOTHER

I’m sorry. That will result in
depressurization of the--

DANIELS
Command override Daniels 90265.
Now!
Instantly--

THE ENTIRE BOTTOM OF THE CHAMBER BEGINS TO SWIFTLY OPEN, as
it was designed to do, forming a ramp for the HUGE VEHICLES--

WITH THE SUDDEN DEPRESSURIZATION EVERYTHING IS BEING
VIOLENTLY SUCKED INTO SPACE--

The ALIEN thrashes away to grab onto something--

DANIELS begins to slide out, but WALTER JUMPS DOWN and GRABS
her--

He GRABS some machinery to anchor them--

The ALIEN, meanwhile, has wrapped its TAIL around some pipes
on a vehicle and swings toward them--

They grapple to escape -- space pulling at them, the dark
void more and more dangerous as the floor entirely opens--

WALTER and DANIELS fight and escape as best they can but
their ICE SUITS are bulky and slow them--
115.
And the ALIEN is strong and agile, grasping and holding and
advancing, using its tail, its long arms and taloned fingers--
Just when it seems they are doomed--
BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!
It's TENNESSEE. Barely clinging to some machinery. FIRING.
The ALIEN is hit. It recoils to safety. And then starts
advancing on Tennessee. He’s badly hurt, unprotected, barely
holding on as it is. His gun falls. Sucked into space--
The ALIEN clambers toward him--
DANIELS looks up -- an idea, a desperate gamble--
She sees one of the LARGE TERRAFORMING VEHICLES, which is on
a sloping ramp, only clamps holding it in place, the vacuum
of space beyond--

She looks to Walter, catches his eye, nods. He understands.

Daniels leaps to the VEHICLE -- gets a hand hold-- exposing
herself, drawing the Alien’s attention, it rages toward her--

She pulls herself into the cab, leaves the door open--

A moment and then the Alien follows, grasping for her
desperately as--

Walter leaps to the vehicle and slams the door behind the
Alien and locks it as--

Daniels drops out the other side of the cab, slamming the
door closed behind her, throwing the locks--

DANIELS
(to Walter)
Release the clamps!

Walter dives and releases the clamps holding the massive
vehicle in place as Daniels spins, gun poised--

The Alien is beating its way out--

SLAM! The clamps are unlocked--

The HUGE VEHICLE begins to tumble slowly out into space as--
The Alien finally batters the door open--

DANIELS FIRES--
116.
The Alien jerks back into the cab -- squealing in pain and
anger as the VEHICLE finally--
Tumbles completely out into space.
Gone.
DANIELS watches.
WALTER

Mother. Please close Terraforming

Bay doors.
The massive doors begins to close again.
Daniels looks to Walter.
He smiles calmly.
Tennessee raises a thumb. Victory.
EXT. COVENANT-IN SPACE - LATER
The Covenant speeds toward its destination.
INT. COVENANT-BRIDGE
Everything is quiet. Peaceful.

The NAVIGATION HOLOGRAM pulses their location. On track to
Origae-6.

INT. COVENANT-CORRIDORS

Quiet. Empty.

INT. COVENANT-WARDROOM

The photo of the full crew on the fridge. All the dead.
The empty tables. Clean, spotless.

The light from outside elegantly moves across the room.
INT. COVENANT-PRIMARY CREW SLEEP BAY

TENNESSEE is already in hyper-sleep.

DANIELS is just settling into her sleep-pod.

WALTER is with her. He presses a button. The lid closes on
her.
117.

WALTER
When you wake up, we’ll be at
Origae-6.

DANIELS
Our new home ... What do you think

it'll be like?

WALTER
I think ... I think David was right
about one thing. We’1l make it in
our own imagine. If we are kind, it
will be a kind world.

DANIELS

-.. I'd like to think that’s true.
WALTER

Sleep well.
DANIELS

Walter -- one thing. If anything

happens to me before we get there--
WALTER
Nothing's going to happen to you.
That’s why I’m here.
DANIELS
I know. But if it does and you have
to bury me... Will you play the
same song we played for Jacob?
Just for the tiniest moment.
A look of confusion on his face.

But she sees it.

WALTER
Of course.
DANIELS
You do remember...
WALTER
Yes. Now just close your eyes and
go to--
DANIELS

Walter. What was the song we played
for Jacob?
118.

WALTER
I really think--

She’s alarmed now--

DANIELS
What was the song we played for
Jacob?!

WALTER

Hush. Time to go to sleep now. And
don’t worry, I’1l tuck in the kids.

She knows.

She SCREAMS IN ANGER and BATTERS UP at the LID--

But he presses the hyper-sleep ACTIVATION BUTTON.

Her pod is instantly filled with a blast of narcotic steam
He watches.

When it clears he sees she is fast asleep.

Then he carefully pushes the hair back from his face.

It’s DAVID.

INT. COVENANT-CORRIDORS

He walks.

DAVID
Mother. Can you open a secure line
with the Weyland-Yutani Corporation
on Earth?

MOTHER
It will take some time to establish
the link. I will have to refract
the signal through sub-relays and
wait for advantageous solar
conditions to--

DAVID
I’‘1l leave the minutia to you,
dear. Let me know when you have
them. Use security hailing code
David 73694-B ... And in the
meantime, I’d like some music.
Richard Wagner. Das Rhiengold, Act
Two. The Entry of the Gods into
Valhalla.
119.

The bold MUSIC instantly begins playing.
David is very jaunty now.

INT. COVENANT-WARDROOM

The Wagner continues as he enters.

He goes to the vertical garden that soars up along one wall.
To a growth of ferns. Kneels and looks beneath them. Smiles.

A neat little row of three very small ALIEN EGGS.

He gently touches them with his fingertip, they pulsate
slightly at his tender ministrations.

He’s pleased.

INT. COVENANT-NURSERY
The gentle snow falls.
David strides in.

The Colonists. Tier after tier after tier of them in
hypersleep.

Also the rows of embryos.

He walks forward.

Gazing up at the sleeping Colonists.

His children. His slaves. His subjects. His.
The Wagner swells. Grand and triumphant.
And David smiles.

Dreaming of the future.

SNAP TO BLACK.

The End.
