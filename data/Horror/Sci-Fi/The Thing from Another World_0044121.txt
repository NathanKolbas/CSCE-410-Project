FADE IN
EXT, NIGHT

The snow piled streets of Dutch Harbor, Alaska, A wind
blows. The street is empty. A bundled figure moves
through the street toward a low roofed lighted building,

A sign outside the building reads:
"OFFICER'S CLUB, DUTCH HARBOR, ALASKA"

Someone has scribbled the words under the printing "No
Penguins allowed",

The figure stops in the doorway and looks at a long
thormomoter, It registers twenty-five below zero. The
figure continues into the club,

INT. OFFICERS CLUB ROOM - MIDNIGHT

This is the social center for U.S.A. flying men roosting
in the Polar regions, The air base is near Dutch Harbor,
Alaska - a commting hop from the Arctic Circle, It is
early winter, The night in Dutch Harbor is long and
dark.

In the room two of the six gaming tables are occupied.
At one sits a four handed bridge game, At the other sit
five men playing poker, RADIO MUSIC - an American
Service Broadcast - is coming a bit feebly into the room.
All is cozy and steam-heated in the room,

Among the five poker players are three men who are to be
active in our story. One is W.0. Vic MacAuliff. He is
a tough, taciturn radio man, He has seen service
everywhere, heard nearly all the languages and drunk
nearly all the different brews of the earth,.

The second is Captain Pat Henry, in his early thirties,
Captain Henry has been a flyer since he shed his first
stocking cap. He is a man of whimsey and temper and
also mood,

The third is Lieutenant Eddie Dykes, a tall, homely man
under thirty. . :

The overcoats, boots, ear-lapped military hats of the
aviators lie on an unused table nearby.

At a large flat-topped table in the room sits Dr. Arthur
Carrington. He is a man of 43 with an alert, cheerful
face. He is good looking, well built, soft spoken.

His dominant characteristic is a smile that seems never
to leave his lips. It is present always on his face
like an extra feature, He is a genius of science and
8 mon whose brain is focused like a microscope on the
secrets of nature, But the intensity of his preoccupa~
tion with science is not to be heard in the easy tones
of his voice. It will be seen in the things he does,
in his point of view - but never in his manner.
Outwardly, he seems only a good looking man full of
child-like enthusiasm for a task and with a soothing,
amiable way for his fellow man.

In the room with Dr. Carrington is a lean young man
named William Stone, in charge of the camp's
photographio work and equipment.

INT. STOREROOM

A faint light from the underground hallway comes through
a transom. Barnes enters. The electric blanket
discarded by Ken lies on a nearby packing case. It is
plugged into the electric light socket, hence no light
in the room. Barnes snaps on his flashlight and gets a
bottle of whiskey out of another case, opens it, and
takes a long swig. He leans over and plugs his flying
suit into the other half of the double~socket shared
by the elegtric blanket's plug. He takes another drink
and, sitting in the semi-dark, starts whistling
"Ragtime Cowboy Joe,"

Suddenly he stops whistling and laughs.

He switches on his flashlight, and
centers its beam on the ice-block,
As Ericson said, the ice is now almost
transparent. Through it, only
partially distorted, can be seen an
unearthly horror. It has a bulbous
head, a tiny suck-hole for a mouth,
multiple eyes, no ears. Its arms
are extra-long, ending in thorny
clusters, rather than hands. It
stares malevolently through the ice.

Barnes lets out a grunt of dismay,
and turns the flashlight sway.

BARNES
Whew!

He drinks again, and then starts
making himself comfortable. He
uses a bag of fhour for a pillow,
and prepares to stretch out on
-the floor. Abruptly he shines
the flashlight on the ice again.

BARNES
(angrily)
Quit staring at me!

He sees the blanket lying on the
nearby packing case. He picks
it up, and throws it over the
ice-cake.

BARNES
I could go nuts looking at you...

He lies down, puts his head on
the flour sack and taking a
magazine from his pocket prepares
to read. The camera moves to

the electric blanket now covering

jumps for the storeroom door, the cord from

It shouldn't. Imagine how strange it
would have seemed in the pliecene age
to forecast that worms, fish, and
lizards that crawled over the earth
were going to evolve ~ into us. On
the planet from which our visitor
came, vegetable life underwent an
evolution similar to that of our own
animal life, which would explain the
superiority of its brain, Its
development was not handicapped by
emotional or sexual factors,

SKEELY
Dr. Carrington, you're a man who's
won the Nobel prize. You've received
every kind of international kudos a
scientist can attain, If you were
for sale I could get a million bucks
for you from any foreign government.

even for a moment if they happen to know
anything about the flora of their own

SKEELY

Thanks, doctor, Ana what's a
Telegraph Vine?

CARRINGTON
A vine that has proven beyond doubt
that 1t can signal to other vines
of its species twenty or one
hundred miles away, If an insect
migration, for instance, is moving
in‘a certain direction, it will
devour the first vine but the second
one, having been warned, will have
altered its chemical structure
so that the insects find it inedible,

SKEELY

if studying him, Now, without haste, it lifts one arm,
and flicks its hand at Carrington's throat, Carrington
falls to tho floor almost decapitated, his Last words
still gurgling in his throat. The Creature steps over
Carrington's corpse and enters the tunnel, It advances
five or six steps,

huge sparks leaps from coiling to floor, The Creature
is caught in the lightning flashes, It stands
motionless as the thousand volt bolts crack through it
from head to foot, In front of it stand the five mon -
