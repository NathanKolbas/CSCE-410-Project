FADE IN:
CLOSE SHOT - MAN'S FACE 1

It is a large, sincere and kindly face, of about fifty-five
years of age, perfectly in keeping with the slow, resonant
tones in which its owner speaks.

MAN
(as we fade in)

. with purity in our hearts, with
right thinking in our minds, we arm
ourselves with an intolerance of all
evil! Thus, it is on this glorious
Sabbath morning, in this momentous
year, 1887, that we naturally turn
our thoughts to that way of life as
exemplified by Victoria, Our Beloved
Queen. For this week begins Her
Majesty's Golden Jubilee. Her strength
and goodness, her Christian
principles, have walked in the light
of God ever since her ascension to
the throne. From her heart has come
an ever-increasing flow of virtue
and moral blessing with which she
has endowed us, her loving subjects.

As the man speaks we BOOM BACK AND AROUND SLOWLY to discover
ourselves in All Souls Southwick Church, London. The man
speaking is the Bishop, talking from the pulpit, backed up
by the well-appointed magnificence of the Anglican altar. WE
PAN AROUND the congregation in the pews. For the most, they
are the well-dressed and well-bred families of the period,
listening attentively.

CLOSE SHOT - IN BACK - MAN AND WOMAN 1A

This is where the less well-to-do parishioners are seated. A
rugged, but strange-looking man of middle-age is seated here
with his wife. She is watching him anxiously. He is listening
intently to the sermon, his head cocked forward. Then he

looks away, passes his hand over his brow, and seems as though
to rise - as he looks at the Bishop o.s.

WIFE
(detaining him, with
a nervous agonized
whisper)
Sam - no! What's wrong, Sam -?

He looks at her, subsides, clenching his jaw.

AS HE CONTINUES:

BISHOP

(continuing)
She came upon a world sadly mired in
ways of the flesh, and during her
reign the forces of good have achieved
notable and great victories over the
forces of evil. And though we know
not the time nor the season, we know
that Evil in God's own time shall be
wiped out by God.

At this point the Bishop is startled by the interruption of
a high-pitched, scornful evil laugh coming from the back of
the church. He looks up.

CLOSE SHOT - IN BACK - MAN AND WOMAN 3
The man is laughing evilly at the Bishop. His horrified little

wife is trying to quiet him, and then looking about her at
the other startled people.

WOMAN
(agonized)
Sam -- Sam --
MAN

(sneering out)
Evil wiped out, eh? So you want to
take all the fun out of life, eh,
Bishop?

CLOSE SHOT - BISHOP 3A
With hardly a flicker he continues:

BISHOP
And may we not live for the day,
when, in the words of Holy writ, the
Devil shall be cast into the
bottomless pit?

GROUP SHOT - CONGREGATION 4

The laughter from 0.s. continues a little. One or two half
turn about. Several look at each other, then back to the
Bishop with stiff-backed composure.

BISHOP'S VOICE
For surely the roots of the realm
and its peoples have sprung froma
new goodness during these last decades --

CLOSE SHOT - TOWARD ALTAR - GROUP 5

They are the backs of an elderly gentleman, a young girl and
fine-looking man of about thirty with a Byronic head. As the
laughter continues through the Bishop's persistent intonation,
the man turns full face into CAMERA AND looks back toward

the disturbance. He is Dr. Henry Jekyll, his vital features
alive with interest.

BISHOP'S VOICE
(continuing)
At the family hearth, in the shops
of industry, in the very Christian
graciousness with which men and women
greet each other during the everyday --

MAN
Bottomless Pit, my eye! Good old
Beelzebub - the boy with the horns
and the spiked tail - they're always
running him down and he's the winner
in the end every time.

A man in back of him tries to pull him down, quietly. He

shakes him off laughing. In the b.g. the aislemen are hurrying
down to him.

GROUP SHOT - CONGREGATION 8

Still they do not look about much, paying even more attention
to the Bishop.

BISHOP'S VOICE

universal goodness is evidenced all

about us more and more as we --

As he looks back, studying man. The young girl with him starts
to look back but the old gentleman on her other side nudges
her not to do so.

short.

of Her Majesty, and worship the glory
and wonder that is God. It is because
of these things that - that -

(he gives a signal to

the choir-master)
- the world moves forward today.

CLOSE SHOT - CHOIR MASTER 11

He signals over to the organist in the b.g. He motions to

the awed kids in the choir to stop looking toward the back

of the church. The music starts the introduction to the choral
anthem.

GROUP SHOT - IN BACK - AROUND MAN 12
The aislemen are struggling with him.

MAN

(with a last shout)
You don't think evil is on a holiday
in here, do you? Ask this bunch here
when they met up with Old Nick last!
Good Old Beelzebub! -- Blasphemy, I
call it, to talk that way about a
man's best friend!

But he is drowned out both by the sudden high soprano boys'
choir and the booming of the organ, as well as the fact that
the three aisle - men drag him out of the pew into the vestry.
The poor wife follows. But the other people hardly notice

him, in their disciplined conservatism. One aisleman dashes
on ahead.

GROUP SHOT - VESTRY 13

A knot of aislemen are around the raving, twisting man. He

is laughing and muttering evilly. The little wife is hovering
about, wringing her hands, as they lead the man from the

main part of the church.

AD LIB
(in hushed tones)
Here, here, now man - Never heard of
such a thing... ssh! Did Parker go
for a constable? Yes. Take his other
arm... This is frightful...

WOMAN

(agonized)
Sam dear - no, lad - no...

CONTINUED: 13
Just at this moment Jekyll comes hurrying out into the vestry.

JEKYLL
(with calm authority)
One moment, please.

The aislemen step back.

MAN
(to Jekyll, who studies
him)
Let me back in there and I'll tell
"em what a grown man really thinks
about -

Jekyll feels the man's pulse, lifts his eye-lid. The man
backs away a little.

JEKYLL
(to woman)
How long has this been going on?

WOMAN
It's - it's been coming on him worse,
sir - ever since the explosion.

JEKYLL
(very interested now)
Oh, a shock, eh?... Excellent - I
see --

MAN
(slyly - to Jekyll)
You're a hearty, full-blooded young
man - you tell ‘em...

WOMAN
I thought maybe if we came to church
it would --

MAN

(trying to nudge Jekyll)
We know - don't we?

WOMAN
(as man laughs again)
No, Sam - there now -

The man edges her away from him. In the meantime, Jekyll has

taken a card out and is writing on it. At this moment, another
aisleman comes in with a very officious constable.

CONSTABLE
Hey - make way here! what's all
this about? What's all this here -
(taking man who he
sees is struggling)
Drunk and disorderly, eh? Well --

JEKYLL
(handing constable
the card)
No, Constable. Take him to the Camden
Hospital. Give this card to Dr. Heath.

CONSTABLE

Better get him to the station, sir.
It's always -

(then seen name on

at Jekyll with sudden

respect )
Oh, Dr. Jekyll! Bats, is he? Right,
sir. Camden Hospital it is, Dr.
Jekyll!

(takes man's arm,

cheerily)
All right there now, my beauty -
upsy-daisy! We'll go and get a little
fresh air in the belfry, eh?

WE PAN HIM out with the man, the woman following.

MAN

(as he is being led

out, calling back

over his shoulder)
Jekyll, eh? Go on back and try to
put old Beelzebub on his pit bottom,
Jekyll! He'll show you! He'll poke
his red beard over the rim! He jumps
on hot fiery rubber, he does!

The voice diminishes, as Jekyll turns and walks back into
church.

PAN SHOT JEKYLL 15

WE HOLD as he comes down the aisle to his pew. Just as he
reaches the pew the congregation rises and starts singing

the hymn to which the choir has been singing the introduction.
WE PAN HIM into his pew where he immediately starts singing
with his two companions. The girl is young, lovely, ripely
virginal, Beatrix Emery. She gives Jekyll a little questioning
look as he comes into pew. The elderly man is her father,

Sir Charles Emery - hawk nose over white mustache - correct
and cultured in his imperious strength. As they sing, we

DISSOLVE TO:
FULL SHOT - EXT. - CHURCH STEPS 15A

Service is over and the crowd is coming out. Inside the church
we hear the organ. Sir Charles, Beatrix and Jekyll are coming
out. WE PAN THEM DOWN THE STEPS across to the carriages at

the curb.

SIR CHARLES

(bowing to a lady and

gentlemen)
Harrison... good morning!

(turns to Beatrix and

Jekyll)
Well, we've just time for a turn in
the park -

BEATRIX
Harry has to leave us, Father.

JEKYLL
I must get to the hospital, sir.

SIR CHARLES
Hospital? On a Sunday? Oh, you mean
that outrageous individual that -?

BEATRIX
Harry says Providence dropped the
poor man right into his lap.

SIR CHARLES
But this is most unusual, my boy.
You know, we always take our stroll

before --

JEKYLL
I'm sorry, but it is, sir. Most
unusual.

By this time they have reached Sir Charles [...] smart open
carriage. A footman stands holding the door open for them. A
groom, in similar livery, is on the box.

BEATRIX
(turning to him)
See you at the Marley's tonight,
now. Don't be late.

JEKYLL
And let you have free rein with all
those men?

He kisses her on the lips, much to Sir Charles' consternation.
She laughs and gets into carriage. Sir Charles, nervous about
the kiss, looking about to see who has noticed it, follows
Beatrix into carriage.

CLOSE TWO SHOT - BEATRIX AND JEKYLL 15B

She sits with her hand resting on the side of the carriage.
O.s. the footman closes the door.

JEKYLL
(intimately)
That's a very silly little hat, by
the way.

BEATRIX
I knew you'd like it.

JEKYLL
(picking up her hand -
kissing it)
There's really nothing about you
that I like at all.

As he holds her hand, he makes a surreptious little bite at
it.

CLOSE SHOT - SIR CHARLES 15C

He has been watching; he starts nervously as he sees Jekyll
do this.

SIR CHARLES
(to groom, o.s.)
All right, Jenkins.
GROUP SHOT - AROUND CARRIAGE 15D
The carriage drives o.s. Jekyll starts backing away, in the

opposite direction, waving to Beatrix. He backs into a fat
old dowager.

Beatrix is waving and laughs louder as she sees Jekyll's
dilemna o.s. As she laughs louder, Sir Charles pulls her
around.

SIR CHARLES
My dear - please -

BEATRIX
But you didn't see him. He backed
right into Lady --

SIR CHARLES
My dear Beatrix - I'ma very broad-
minded man, as you know - but despite
the fact that you and Harry are
engaged to be married, I wish he
wouldn't carry on his demonstrations
of affection in public.

BEATRIX
Now, Father darling - don't be
pompous.

SIR CHARLES
(bowing to a passerby

But good heavens - nibbling your
knuckles...

Beatrix bursts out in a peal of healthy laughter, throwing
back her head.

CLOSE SHOT - INT. HOSPITAL - MRS. HIGGINS' FACE 16

Mrs. Higgins is the woman with the man who caused the
disturbance in the church. She is sobbing silently in contrast
to Beatrix and WE PULL BACK to see her standing outside a
door in the corridor of the hospital. AS WE HOLD the door
opens and a young interne steps out with a rather
surreptitious look back into the room. All we can see in the
room is the end of a bed with a man's feet strapped to it.

MAN'S VOICE
(Higgins, as door
opens)
Now, Doctor, my lad - as man to man -
we know what's fun in life and what
isn't! Eh, Doctor?

The man laughs wildly. The interne closes the door quietly
and WE PAN HIM as he hurries down the hall to the end, and
enters a door.

CLOSE SHOT - DOOR AT END 17
On it is marked: "House Physician - Dr. Heath."

INTERNE'S VOICE
I'm sorry, sir. But Dr. Jekyll insists
going ahead with treatment.

HEATH'S VOICE
But that mustn't be! The man's under
observation!

INTERNE'S VOICE
Yes, sir. That's what I told him,
but -- You better come, sir.

The young interne comes out with Dr. Heath, a matured
physician of about fifty. Dr. Heath wears a worried frown on
his face. WE TRUCK WITH THEM a little way back toward the
room.

DR. HEATH
(agitated - as they
come out)

He has no right to do such a thing!

INTERNE
I suggested it would be better that
he consult you first, sir - but he
still --

DR. HEATH
I know. Thank you, Fenwick.

WE PAN them on down the hall to the door where Mrs. Higgins
is waiting.

CLOSE SHOT - AT PATIENT'S DOOR 18

Dr. Heath enters the room. Mrs. Higgins sobbing, puts her
hand on the interne's arm as he is about to follow. Inside,
the man Higgins is laughing evilly.

MRS. HIGGINS
Isn't there anything they can -?

INTERNE
Everything possible is being done,
Mrs. Higgins. Dr. Jekyll knows more
about your husband's case than any
other mental specialist in London.

HIGGINS' VOICE
(from inside)
Why! Here's another doctor! But don't
ask him! He's too old!

The interne closes the door. The man's high laugh comes from
inside. Almost immediately the door is opened by Dr. Heath
who comes out with Jekyll.

DR. HEATH
It's a matter of ethics, Jekyll. I
can't allow it.

MRS. HIGGINS
Dr. Jekyll, can't I go in and --

JEKYLL
(gently, patting her
shoulder )
Not yet, Mrs. Higgins. Bear up now.
That's the way you said you'd help -
remember.

Continues to Heath as WE PAN THEM DOWN the corridor, Jekyll
obviously trying to control himself

JEKYLL
But, good heavens, man - this is the
chance of a lifetime for me. The
more I see of the case the more I
realize it.

unoccupied room.

HEATH
It's quite possible that this case
might fall within the bounds of your
research. You know how we've all
admired your other work in the past.
And personally, I'd like to bow to
your opinion here, but in my position
as head of the staff, I cannot
countenance --

He stops and realizes they are being watched o.s. as he looks
down the hall.

CLOSE SHOT - MRS. HIGGINS - THEIR ANGLE 20
She stands looking at them pathetically, wringing her hand.
TWO SHOT - JEKYLL AND HEATH 21

HEATH
(indicating open door)
Better come in here.

They go into vacant room and close door.
SLOW TRUCKING SHOT - MRS. HIGGINS 22

She looks at the room her husband is in, then starts
timorously along the hall to the door behind which are Heath
and Jekyll. WE HOLD A SECOND here. She would like to go in.
She starts to knock. Jekyll's and Heath's voices are only
murmurs.

JEKYLL'S VOICE
(suddenly rising clear)
But I'm not witch doctor!

HEATH'S VOICE
(rising, too - very
clear)
Who's called you a witch doctor? You
told me yourself you've had no
definite success. I can't allow you
to experiment with -

There are sudden quick footsteps toward door, and it is flung
open by Jekyll.

HEATH

Why, the man's a human being -!

Jekyll wheels on him at the door, his eyes blazing.

JEKYLL
You mean he was a human being! And
he'd have another chance at it, if
you'd keep your hide-bound ethics
out of this! There aren't any rules
for discovering medical Utopia! Or
perhaps you haven't the courage to
face what might be the greatest -!

He stops, glaring impotently at Heath, who steps back a
little, so vehement is Jekyll's look and attitude. Then,
with an inarticulate growl of disgust, Jekyll wheels away
quickly, AS WE TRUCK AND PAN with him to the end of the
corridor and around the corner. The tension of his anger
relaxes into a bitter smile as he walks along. He passes
some swinging glass opaque doors marked: "CHILDREN'S WARD"
and is about to go on when he thinks of something and turns
back, entering the ward.

PAN SHOT - JEKYLL - INT. WARD 23

As he walks down between corridor of beds and steps quickly
behind screen which covers the fourth of fifth bed. This is
obviously the Children's Orthepedoic Ward as we see by the

condition of the patients in the various beds.

CLOSE SHOT - AT BED 24

A small boy has obviously been badly smashed in an accident.
A worried young father, sitting by the bed, gets up quickly
as Jekyll comes in. The little boy, his legs suspended in a
pully contraption, smiles weakly at Jekyll as the latter
feels his pulse.

JEKYLL
(to little boy)
Hullo, Tommy Atkins - how's the war?

The little boy laughs in weak happiness.
FATHER
(to Jekyll)
He's - he's going to be all right,
isn't he, doctor?
Jekyll waits a second, counting pulse.
JEKYLL
(smiling at boy)
Charlie and I never had a doubt about
it, did we, Charlie?

At this moment o.s. we hear a little girl's voice wailing.

LITTLE GIRL'S VOICE (0.S.)
I can't! Please, nurse --

NURSE'S VOICE (0.S.)
Now do as nurse says, Dorothy.

Jekyll looks in the direction of the voice and walks off
o.s.

25 35 GROUP SHOT - AISLE BETWEEN BEDS 25

A nurse is trying to get a little girl of five or six to
throw away her crutches and walk. The little girl is
frightened. Neither of them notices Jekyll as he comes out
in the aisle and watches the scene.

NURSE
Give the crutches to nurse now,
Dorothy.

DOROTHY

(her lip quivering)
I can't! I'll fall again. I don't
want to fall again.

NURSE
(starting to reason
again)
Dorothy dear, listen to me. If I
tell you -?

26 CLOSE SHOT - JEKYLL 26
Jekyll is studying Dorothy o.s.

DOROTHY'S VOICE
But I'll hurt myself some more. I

can't walk.
JEKYLL
(suddenly - firmly)
Dorothy!

(he exits towards her)

FULL SHOT 28

Dorothy allows Jekyll to take the crutches from her. She
stands wavering.

JEKYLL
(without holding out
hands)
Now walk. Walk here to me.

Dorothy teeters after him as he backs up slowly for fifteen
feet. As she reaches Jekyll he kneels down and steadies her.

GROUP SHOT - JEKYLL, DOROTHY AND NURSE 29

DOROTHY
(looking at him in
wonder )
I walked! I walked, didn't I?

JEKYLL

(almost severely)
Dorothy, always remember you can do
anything in this world you put your
mind to.

(then patting her

head with a grin)
Why, you'll be dancing on Hampstead
Heath next Bank Holiday!

He straightens up and hands her over to the nurse who exits
with her. Jekyll turns and WE PAN HIM OUT of the ward.

FULL SHOT - EXT. WARD 30

Just as Jekyll comes out into corridor; he is joined by a
pleasant, solid-looking man of about his age, Dr. John Lanyon,
his friend and colleague. Lanyon, a stethescope about his
neck, yet attired as Jekyll, looks concerned as WE TRUCK

THEM down the corridor.

DR. LANYON
Harry, old boy, what's up? There're
rumors of a tiff between you and --

JEKYLL
(with a calming
gesture, and a rueful
smile)
Don't worry, John. The bull is leaving
the china shop.

DR. LANYON

But you must realize that Heath has

(CONTINUED)
30

16.
CONTINUED: 30

JEKYLL

(sardonically, yet

with affection)
I realize, Dr. John Lanyon, my friend
and eminently respected surgeon that
your Dr. Heath is right. My treatment
was not yet thoroughly proven. And
if we doctors were allowed to
experiment on human beings, too many
things would go wrong - and human
beings might lose faith even in the
proven good of medicine. Isn't that
it?

By this time WE HOLD as they reach a table near the foyer on
which doctors have placed their hats and sticks and from
which Jekyll picks up his.

DR. LANYON
(attempting to reason)
Harry --
JEKYLL

(now definitely)
But I'm not far from proof! And when
I get it: Ethics or no ethics!

Lanyon shrugs, and laughs, patting Jekyll with a soothing
gesture on the back, and exiting 0.s. down another turn of
the corridor.

Then Jekyll thinks of something and starts quickly back down
the corridor just as the interne of the previous SCENE rounds
a corner to meet him, carrying a leather vial case. WE HOLD.

INTERNE
(handing case to him)
I thought perhaps you'd --

JEKYLL

(quickly, serious)
Yes.

(opens case, runs his

fingers over tops of

vials disclosed to

see if all are there,

then closes it)
Thank you, Fenwick.

key and locking case as he goes, as we,

FULL SHOT - EXT. JEKYLL'S HOUSE - LATER 31

It is the type of house found in Harley Street of Adam
architecture, proving Jekyll's means and position. Jekyll's
carriage draws up and stops.

CLOSER SHOT - AT CARRIAGE 31A

Jekyll merely sits and stares ahead of him, unaware that he
is home. The groom, not hearing him open the door, looks
around. This causes Jekyll to look at the groom, realize
they have reached home.

JEKYLL
Oh - yes, Burke -

He gets out, and WE PAN HIM up to the front door. He takes
out his key and enters.

OUT. 32
FULL SHOT - INT. ENTRANCE HALL - JEKYLL'S HOUSE 33

Jekyll lets himself in with the key, walks slowly to the
center of the hall, stands there in thought for a second.
Poole, his butler, an old man full of warm adoration for
him, is hurrying down the stairs, and goes to him.

POOLE
(taking his hat and
stick)
Good afternoon, sir.

JEKYLL
(almost to himself)
Hello, Poole...

POOLE
I'm so glad you're home for tea,
sir. Where will you take it?

away )
Oh - anywhere....

crumpets, sir - but we mustn't have
too much, or we shan't be eating a
good dinner at the Marley's - and
Miss Beatrix would be after me

properly.
JEKYLL
(not having heard a
word)
Hmmm...

With this he quickens his pace, and darts through an entrance
way off the hall.

FULL PAN SHOT - EXT. COURTYARD AND BRIDGE - JEKYLL'S HOUSE 34

The back court and garden are sunk below the ground level of
the main house. Jekyll comes from the main house across a
bridge which leads to another separate building in back, his
laboratory. He reaches door of lab. Poole stands in the door
of the main house.

POOLE
Shall I serve it in the laboratory,
sir?
CLOSE SHOT - POOLE - AT DOOR OF MAIN HOUSE 35
POOLE

hopelessly.

FULL SHOT - INT. LAB 36

In the center of the room is a huge work-table covered by a
strange series of test tubes, vials, crucibles, a smelter...
and a mysterious pharaphernailia of connected glass stills
form a weird unknown world in themselves. There is a cabinet
full of surgical instruments and another larger closed cabinet
with a heavy lock. There is little furniture except a writing
desk with a file and a chair. Jekyll hurries along a balcony
and down a flight of steps at the back into the room. He
places his case on the table. WE DOLLY AND PAN HIM over toa
row of cages filled with rats, guinea pigs and rabbits. His
manner is anxious, anticipatory. He looks at the first two

or three cages. In the first a couple of guinea pigs seem
rather active. He looks at their actions closely. He seems a
little excited as he passes to the next two cages, but then
his expression falls.

CLOSE SHOT - TWO CAGES - HIS ANGLE - 36A

In one a large rabbit lies dead. In the second is a large
dead rat.

CLOSE SHOT - JEKYLL 36B

He reaches o0.s. and picks out the two dead animals. WE PAN
HIM down the wall a little.

-- [19] --

He takes a large rabbit out of a smaller cage. It is gentle
and sniffs his hand. He strokes its head. WE PAN HIM back as
he puts the rabbit into the experimental cage and then PAN
HIM as he picks up a heavy glove and puts it on his hand. He
stops by a cage in which is a large wharf rat, and reaches
in for it with his gloved hand.

CLOSE SHOT - RAT - INT. CAGE 36C
He backs into a corner as Jekyll's hand enters and then

springs at Jekyll's fingers, biting the leather. But Jekyll's
hand pins him down by the back of the neck.

38

He brings the rat out and WE PAN him as he places it in the
second experimental cage. He picks up the two dead animals,
crosses with them to the main laboratory table. He unlocks
his case and takes out a single vial and looks from vial to
the dead animals. We feel a connection between them and the

Her expression is also troubled. She sits dawdling with her
dessert, and then she looks o.s. as WE PULL BACK ALONG the
table.

The Marley dining room is typical of the period, high stiff
chairs, seating fourteen people. They are in evening dress.
Mr. Marley, the vacant-looking host, sits at one end. On his
left, in order, are: Mrs. French, [...] Courtney - a bearded
conservative of the profession, Mrs. Courtney, Sir Charles,
Mrs. Weymouth - a female eagle withered from the tropics,
Colonel Weymouth, her husband, an old red-faced officer of
horse in mufti with decorations on his lapel, and then Mrs.
Marley, hostess. On Mrs. Marley's right, in order are:

The Bishop of All Souls, Lady Cooper - a coy female, then an
empty chair, then Beatrix, Lanyon, and Mrs. Arnold next to
Mr. Marley.

There is quiet, well-bred small talk. A butler and two maids
are in attendance. WE HOLD on Sir Charles as he looks at his
watch, and then glances o.s. at the empty chair next to
Beatrix.

She reacts to her father's frown and turns to smile casually

Jekyll is just entering the dining room from the drawing

him. Jekyll heads straight for Mrs. Marley. The men rise.

She looks at him a little stiffly as she offers her hand.

JEKYLL
My deepest apologies.

MRS. MARLEY

I know - you doctors - we can never

Mrs. Marley, I'd rather be reminded

hostess in London than to be on the

There is correct laughter at this "risque" dialogue.

Wasn't a patient, exactly. I started
something in the laboratory and just
forgot to lock at the clock.

DR. COURTNEY

Ah, yes, Jekyll - Heath was telling
me you're still carrying on with
that research of yours.

If you didn't see him, you all heard
him, I'm sure.

BISHOP
Ah, yes. I thank you for your
assistance there, Dr. Jekyll.

DR. COURTNEY
(with finality)
Hopelessly insane. Obviously.

MRS. MARLEY
Why, the simply shocking things he
said...

JEKYLL

He wasn't insane. There was just one
side of him in existence. And that
side was speaking the truth.

COLONEL WEYMOUTH
Good heavens! Which side?

JEKYLL
His evil side. The man has been
spiritually distorted through shock...
that explosion in the gas mains last
month. Before that he was a fine,
solid citizen - gentle and kind with
his children - deeply in love with
his wife. Since then, he's suffered
a complete change - so that this
afternoon I saw him entirely reverted
to the animal - slythinking and vile,
dangerous and rapacious, by turns.

But Harry - what's that to do with
the soul? We can clearly understand
it as an injury to the nervous system
and therefore --

JEKYLL

(now lost in his

subject, earnestly

reasoning)
No, no, John - I insist he has been
shocked from normal good into complete
evil. When I said before he was a
"good" man, I didn't mean that he
didn't have a bad thought or two
from time to time -- and perhaps
commit his portion of transgressions
against the laws of civilized society.
Because, after all - that is the
problem of civilized Man's soul -the
good and the evil in it are constantly
fighting one another.

The Bishop is the least affronted, very interested, but

53 GROUP SHOT - INCLUDING JEKYLL 53

JEKYLL

(warmed to his subject,

glad of the interest)
Well, to put it as simply as I can -
Good and evil are so close as to be
chained together in the soul. Man
isn't truly one, but two. Now what
if we could break that chain -
separate those two selves --

(his face alight,

lost in his subject)
To free the good in man, and let it
go on to its higher destiny... to
segregate the bad in man - and let
it destroy itself in its own
degradation!

(looks around, sees

he has gone beyond

their comprehension -

finishes lamely)
Well, roughly that's what my research

is leading to -- a combination of
chemical agents, which if administered
would --

Marley has just awakened to the fact that his guests aren't
very happy - particularly the two nervous ladies on his either
side. Also, he feels his own "character" attacked.

MARLEY

But see here - aren't you rather
presumptuous in assuming there is
evil in all men?

JEKYLL
Of course there's evil in all men!

He speaks the following with a peculiar faunlike glee, jabbing
at them with his tone, quietly, but watching them all as he
looks around the table. He's mad now at their subborn refusal
to look at the facts.

Christian we admit that Man was
created weak! It's an honest problem.
Shouldn't we face it?

By this time WE HOLD ON the Bishop. There is a tense silence!

Suppose we believe that Man's soul
has not yet reached its fulfillment.
Is it right or wise to tamper with
this problem, until its Creator has
solved it - in His own mysterious
way?

DR. COURTNEY
Really, Jekyll - this is quite

Council will be forced to say if --

Sir Charles looks with alarm at what Dr. Courtney is saying.

JEKYLL

Especially if there's a confortable

Really, Colonel Weymouth? Suppose

the soldier when he comes out of
battle - keyed up from the lust of
killing? What about his thoughts?
He's lonely - bewildered. why just
recall yourself, as a young subaltern
in Egypt - back from a campaign up
the Nile - on a moonlit night in
Cairo. What were your thoughts? What
was in your mind?

For a moment the Colonel is so moved by the glamor and

TRUCKING SHOT - JEKYLL AND LANYON - STREET 75

They are in another part of town, taking a short cut ina
rather dingy section. At this point they cross the entrance
to a narrow mews (alley) and WE HOLD as sounds of a struggle
and cries come from its darkened recess.

GIRL'S VOICE (0.S.)
Let me go, you -! Why you filthy -!
Help -!

Jekyll and Lanyon both look down the mews, then dart o.s.
toward the sound.

GROUP SHOT - IN MEWS 76

Jekyll and Lanyon rush into SCENE to find a hulk of a gent
struggling unpleasantly with young girl. The scene is lit by
dim gas light. Jekyll pulls the man off the girl, who drops
to the ground with a moan against a rubbish box or an old
packing case. The gent starts to fight, then sees two against
one, and streaks down the mews with Lanyon and Jekyll in
pursuit, as WE PAN.

TWO SHOT - OTHER END OF MEWS 77

As the gent flies in and out of SCENE, Jekyll and Lanyon
stop, as they watch him streak across the street.

Jekyll can't help but smile, amused by her reaction. Then:

Nonsense. Let's try it, shall we?

JEKYLL

makes no remark)
Naturally.

It is the usual dingy rooming house chamber, appointed as of

Jekyll puts his hat and stick down on a chair, and then closes
the door. WE PAN him over to her as she looks up at him,

half shy, half excitedly expectant.

JEKYLL

Bad. Stops the circulation.

The girl looks down and then looks up at him, pathetically

There! You see now? You did find
something. You are my doctor, aren't

JEKYLL
No. But I have to go -
GIRL
But, look here - don't you understand?
I ain't no--
JEKYLL

it's just a little too generous,

girl - just be a little smarter about
the company you pick from now on. Hm -

As he says this, he puts out his hand. She ignores it.

Yes. I have it coming to me, my dear.

CLOSE SHOT - JEKYLL - FACE DOWN ON FLOOR 150

His back is to the CAMERA (or is it Jekyll?). We ask as WE
PAN UP WITH HIM, his back like an animal's in a crouch. The
top of his head is strangely elongated, his ears are pointed.
As yet we do not see his face but FOLLOW HIM as he slowly
shuffles, gasping and grunting to the mirror. There over his
shoulder, we get a look at his face for the first time. It
is hideous in its transformation into Evil, yet withal
containing a strange fascinating Pan-like quality. At first
he starts, as though an animal looking in the mirror for the
first time. Then he peers closer. And he starts to laugh,
slowly, softly at first, then mounting to loud yelps.

JEKYLL

(into mirror - like

eyeing a work of

great art)
Look at you... look at you... what
beautiful consumate evil!

(shouting exultantly)
There you are! And I made you! What
a rainbow of unspeakable colors could
you paint the world's horizon if I
turned you loose!

(laughs louder,

triumphantly now)
There it is, Sir Charles! Look at
it, John Lanyon! Show this to the
Medical Council, Dr. Courtney!

JEKYLL

Hypocrites! Fools! Blind men! Deny
what's in your souls, will you? You
can't deny that!

Then WE PAN HIM as he capers about the room, leaping and
stretching and jumping up and down like a faun, laughing all
the time. 0.s. there is a knock on the door which he doesn't
hear.

CLOSE SHOT - EXT. LAB - DOOR TOWARD HOUSE 151

Inside the laughter comes over the SCENE. Poole, in his
dressing gown, is listening. He reacts to laughter, then
starts banging on the door, trying to open it.

POOLE
(in great alarm)
Dr. Jekyll - Dr. Jekyll! What's
happening, sir? Are you all right?

CLOSE SHOT - JEKYLL - INT. LAB 152

He stops capering as he hears the banging on the door, alert
as a wild animal.

JEKYLL
Eh? Who's there? Who is it?

POOLE'S VOICE
It's Poole, sir! Dr. Jekyll - is
that you, sir?

The banging continues. Jekyll looks wildly about, then sees
vials on the table. He hurriedly starts mixing them in another
potion.

JEKYLL
Just a moment, now!

CLOSE SHOT - POOLE - EXT. LAB DOOR 153
When he hears the silence, he gets even more worried.

POOLE
Who is that in there? Dr. Jekyll -
answer me, sir! Dr. Jekyll --!

He shoves his weight against the door, cannot budge it, then
starts o.s. toward the house when he is called back by
footsteps on the stairs. He waits a little warily, as they
come toward the door. The door opens quickly. Dr. Jekyll
stands there, his natural self. He is pale, perspiring,
breathing heavily.

JEKYLL

(trying to be calm)
Yes, Poole.

POOLE
(stammering)
Why, sir - I - I'm sorry, sir - I
heard a frightful noise -and a strange
voice - and - and I thought something
had happened, sir.

JEKYLL
No... it was quite - all right, Poole.
There was someone here. He - he was
a friend of mine. A - er - a... Mr.

Hyde. He was a bit - well, under the
weather - rather obstreperous. I got
him out by the back door.

POOLE
Oh, I see, sir.
(then, back to the
servant again)
Miss Beatrix is here, sir.

JEKYLL
(hit between the eyes)
Miss Beatrix.... alone?

POOLE
(re-assuringly)
I've shown her to the consulting
room, sir.

JEKYLL
Tell - tell Miss Beatrix I shall be
there at once.

POOLE
Very good, sir.

Jekyll closes the door, as Poole exits o.s.
FULL SHOT - LAB 154

Jekyll comes down the stairs in the b.g. He is stunned by
this announcement from Poole. Mechanically, dazed, he starts
putting on his tail coat. Then with a sudden rush of thought,
as WE PAN, he rushes to the mirror again, examines his face
to see if any of the awful evil is left. He feels his cheek,
his brow, his ear. He covers his face with his hand, in
revulsion at what he had seen earlier. Then he looks at
himself again.

JEKYLL
(muttering through
his teeth some dim
remembered quotation)
"... if once this thing is born again,
Decapitate it - e're it fouls the
air..."

Then he quickly turns from the mirror, crosses and picks up
the letter he has written Beatrix, tears it into small pieces,
throws it in the waste-basket, and adjusting his coat, starts
up the stairs. Half way up he hesitates, then proceeds more
slowly, as we

DISSOLVE TO:
FULL SHOT - INT. JEKYLL'S CONSULTING ROOM - BEATRIX 155

The room is much as we would expect... a desk, consultation
chair, many shelves of medical books, a few standard
instruments in a case. Beatrix is seated, nervous and anxious.
She turns quickly, as Jekyll opens the door from the hall,

in the b.g. Jekyll's attitude is one of hesitancy at first,

as though awaiting some feared reaction from her.

BEATRIX
(quickly)
Then you're not -? Harry, what's the -
?

(on this she is

starting over towards

him, then stops,

looking at him - his

attitude is tense,

strained as though

she knew something.

Then she gives hima

puzzled little smile,

feels her temple)
I can't explain why... but I hada
strange feeling you were going away -
without ever seeing me again
isn't that silly?

(she slowly sinks

down in a chair,

looks about the room,

then up at him with

an embarrassed,

nervous little laugh)
It - it was silly, wasn't it? Because
here you are - and here I am...

JEKYLL
(feeling he must say
something)
I had to go to the hospital, Bee....
the man died.

BEATRIX
Oh, I'm sorry... maybe that's what I
felt. But it was just something that --
(then, with another
little laugh)
Why - I had no reason to come at
all!

She rises again, automatically. Jekyll takes her hand with a
sudden gesture.

JEKYLL
Oh, yes, Bee - yes!

BEATRIX
(with a soft smile)
You're glad I'm here then?

Jekyll sweeps her into his arms. Holds her almost desperately
close. In this gesture, her cape falls to the floor.

JEKYLL
Glad? I'd have come to you, I think -
if you hadn't -- I mean - tonight,
somehow, I missed you more than
ever...
BEATRIX
(her lips against his
cheek)

When I'm in this house, I won't let
you waste your nights in that stuffy
old laboratory... You know that,
don't you - hmmm...?

JEKYLL
(almost to himself)
You'll never be out of sight -!

He holds her for a second, then:
BEATRIX
(turning her face to
his)
I don't want to go home....

JEKYLL
Bee....

155 CONTINUED: (2) 155

BEATRIX
You said it wasn't evil for us to --
please, don't send me away now....

He looks full in her eyes for a second, then they kiss
passionately.

BEATRIX

(ecstatic)

Oh, my love -!
(then she stops, and
withdraws from him a
little, as her eyes
catch something o.s.
Jekyll turns too.
Beatrix's chin lifts
in defiance. Then,
quietly: )

Yes, Father....?

WE PAN OVER slowly to pick up Sir Charles standing in the

open door-way. Behind him in the hall is Poole, nervously

wringing his hands. Poole ducks o.s., as Sir Charles comes
slowly into the room, as WE PAN, and confronts Beatrix and
Jekyll. Without a word, he leans down, picks up Beatrix's

cape and hands it to her.

SIR CHARLES
(in a quiet, cold
voice to Jekyll)
I am very grateful for the anxiety
you caused us this evening -
(to Beatrix)
I was unable to sleep myself.

JEKYLL
Sir Charles, I asked Beatrix to come
here tonight --

BEATRIX
(reproving him)
Harry - you --

JEKYLL

Because I --

SIR CHARLES
All I can believe is that your
theories of behavior are not normal,
Jekyll -- not fit. I might say not
even --

BEATRIX
(interrupting quickly)
Father, I don't expect you to
understand. I'm not ashamed.

SIR CHARLES
Then I shall be for you... because I
do understand. You and I are leaving
for the Continent tomorrow. We shall
be catching the afternoon boat-train.

JEKYLL
(stunned)
The Continent? Oh, come, sir --
there's --

BEATRIX
(pleading now)
Oh, Father, please -!

JEKYLL
(trying to reason)
Sir Charles - you could avoid all of
this misunderstanding if you'd set
an early date for our marriage.

BEATRIX
Please, Father....

SIR CHARLES

The date remains as planned.

(to Jekyll)
And if you haven't abolished those
unhealthy experiments of yours -

(as Jekyll starts to

speak)
Oh, I know you're still working at
them - why, we'll consider the
engagement broken.

JEKYLL

entirely with everything that I -

SIR CHARLES
That will await our return. Come,
Beatrix.

BEATRIX
(to Jekyll)
Harry - if you don't wish me to go
away - I shall refuse.

SIR CHARLES
(sternly)
Beatrix -!

BEATRIX
I mean it, Father.

She turns to Jekyll for an answer. He looks at her for a
long time.

JEKYLL

(finally)
I don't want you to go away, Bee.
But - even though you and I can't
agree with him - your Father is only
thinking of your happiness. I can't
disrespect him in that. I can't ask
you to.

There is a moment of silence. Beatrix sees that Jekyll means
it.
SIR CHARLES
(with a relieved sigh,

more gently now)
That's highly commendable, Harry.

Beatrix now tries to smile. She offers her hand to Jekyll.

BEATRIX
(fighting tears)
You - you'll see us off at the train?

JEKYLL
(taking her hand -
nodding)
It better have two engines - or I'll
try to hold it back.

BEATRIX
Try anyway.

She goes close to him, kisses his cheek swiftly, and with a
little sob, turns and hurries out.

At bottom of stair, he stops and looks at Jekyll o.s.

He is moody and disconsolate, as he looks at the rain outside.

(tears open letter,

Poole starting to

move away with the

tray)
And your sherry wine, too - what's

Poole comes back and gives glass to Jekyll. Jekyll starts
reading letter avidly, holding wine in his hand. Poole moves
0.s.

As he comes to a desk, and starts straightening things up.
He wants to talk, to cheer his master up.

POOLE
Miss Beatrix should be returning
home in another week, shouldn't she,
sir? Hobson told me they were
expected.

He gets no answer from Jekyll o.s. He turns to look.

CLOSE SHOT - JEKYLL - POOLE'S ANGLE 168
Jekyll's expression is turning from interested delight to
puzzlement. Then his face clouds entirely. He puts glass

down on window-sill. It falls over with a tinkle and a splash.
Jekyll quickly turns the page, anguished.

(LINES ARE FROM TOP OF PAGE)

"... did not write yesterday because I'm so distressed.

Darling heart - Father - refuses to come home. We are leaving
tomorrow for Italy - to be gone I don't know how long. Oh,

Not bad news, I hope, sir.

Miss Beatrix will be gone indefinitely -

POOLE

Oh, I'm sorry, sir. Sir Charles'
health, no doubt.

(a pause, as Poole

watches Jekyll slump

down in a chair)
If you'll forgive me, sir - it
distresses me to see you down this
way. It's not right, sir. Might I
suggest that you pick up and go out
this evening for a bit of fun? They
say there's a very entertaining
musical comedy at the Gaiety -

(with a little cough)
- er - ah -, very daring, you know,
sir -

Jekyll considers this a moment, looking at Poole. Then:

JEKYLL
(dryly) ;
I'm afraid that's not particularly
becoming in my position, Poole -
(then with a sardonic
chuckle) )
Nor even wise, I might add....

He rubs his face in his hands.

POOLE
Another glass of sherry wine, sir?

JEKYLL
(face in his hands,
wearily)
No thank you, Poole...

POOLE
Yes, sir.

Poole exits from scene, with tray and broken glass. We hear
him go upstairs 0.s. and close the door. Then Jekyll gets up
with sudden impatience. WE PAN HIM as he walks about the
room. He fiddles with a tube or two, straightening it

absently.

He finds a pipe on the table, knocks it out. He

feels in his pocket for tobacco pouch. Doesn't find it. He
walks over by the cabinet.

He is looking for his pouch, when suddenly, his eyes catches

It is still where Jekyll must have tossed it weeks ago. Its
cheap little clasp, glistens in the lamplight.

CLOSE SHOT - JEKYLL 173

Fascinated, he slowly bends over and picks it up. He feels

it in his hand. He thinks of the girl. Then he quickly throws
it on the table. WE PAN HIM as he paces the length of the
room again, nervously. This brings him opposite the mirror.
He looks at himself then thinks, looks back at the garter,
then over at a cabinet. Then he makes his decision, and
hurries to the cabinet, pulling out some vials of powders

and liquids from various pigeon-holes. As he hastily carries
them to the lab table and sits himself down to mix them, we

DISSOLVE TO:
CLOSE SHOT - FINISHED POTION 174

As Jekyll's hand picks it up WE PAN to his face. He hesitates
a second, looks at the garter nearby, then with a desperate
gesture he drains the potion. The same reaction sets in as
before. In violent convulsions, his face starts to turn. He
grips the sides of the chair in agony. WE PAN DOWN to his
hand. It turns into an animal-like appendage. His four fingers
seem to grow together a little bit at the base, and then
separate in the middle, almost like the beginning of a cloven
hoof. His neck becomes thick and shorter.

WE PAN UP to his face. It is worse than before. WE PAN DOWN
to the other hand. The same process is happening here. He is
gasping and writhing all the while. WE PAN UP again to his
face. The transformation now becomes complete. It is worse
in this second stage - more bestial than faun. His writhing
stops. He rises, shakes his head - feels the change in his
thoughts.

(NOTE: The question of each metamorphosis and its subsequent
gradations according to makeup is open to debate so that all
parties concerned in the production agree and are satisfied)

GIRL'S VOICE

It's in your eyes - it's in your
eyes...

animal in the middle of the room, thinks again.

you? You're caught...

He capers about a second, then quickly takes his cape, stick
and hat from a hanger, and darts out the back door.

He takes a key out of his pocket, and locks the door. Then
he turns and looks about him. He takes off his hat and

Then he darts off into the darkness as we

Ah! At the Palace of Varieties!
What a shallow hearth for the fire

head to one side)
But - variety, eh? Variety! I like

With a caper, he pokes the landlady in her backside with his
stick, and dashes out of the door.

CLOSE SHOT - CURB - EXT. IVY'S PLACE 177

Hyde comes out, gleeful at the prospect of finding Ivy. He
comes abreast of an old blind man who is timidly tapping his
stick on the curb, preparatory to crossing the street. Hyde
takes his arm with exaggerated solicitation.

HYDE
Why, why! Let me give you a hand,
Uncle!

BLIND MAN

Oh...thank you, sir!

WE TRUCK AHEAD OF THEM across the street. They weave their
way past a couple of drays. Then, in the middle of the street,

Hyde has the sudden caprice to pull him tumbling off his

seat, rolling him on the pavement. Hyde throws the money on

top of him and then pokes him with his stick.

A smoke-filled Utopia with a bar at one end, a stage at the
other. Along the side, boxes with tables and chairs - and
tables and chairs ranging on an incline from the stage back
towards the bar. The "chairman" at his table down front is
conducting the proceedings on the stage, a row of plump
soubrettes in a song and dance ensemble to the tune of
"Champagne Charlie". WE SEE Hyde come in in the b.g.

CLOSE SHOT - HYDE 181

He comes in, stands a moment, smelling the wind like an
expectant ram. A waiter approaches him, sees his quality
attire. Hyde hands him his ticket.

WAITER
Ah, yes, sir - Box F, sir.

WE PAN THEM through the tables and up some small steps around
in back of a box which Hyde enters. The waiter stands,
expecting an order, as Hyde's eyes dart about, savoring the
place. The waiter is now a little leery of Hyde's looks and
wants to please.

WAITER
A brandy and soda, sir?

his head)

The waiter exits. Hyde continues to sweep the room with his
look.

This pleases him no end. He lifts his stick and rotates it
like the limbs of the girls. The waiter appears with the
brandy and soda, puts it down.

Hyde picks up the glass, starts to drink, and just then
notices something o.s. His eyes light up.

EFFECT SHOT - HIS ANGLE - IVY 186

She is behind the bar, laughing and joking with two or three
men. The reason Hyde can see her is that she is standing on
a stool, reaching up for a bottle at the back of the bar, as
she looks back at the men below. We cannot hear what she is
saying, naturally.

Hyde notices waiter's presence.

you're to do it.

IVY

Oh, he does, eh? Well, tell him ita

WAITER
He wants a bottle of the boy.

IVY
(happily surprised)
Oh! Bubbly! why didn't you say so?

She takes a bottle of champagne from a box of cracked ice
behind bar. Puts it on a tray.

1ST MAN
(during this)
Hey, Ivy love - what about some fish
and chips after the show?

2ND MAN
What about a dozen oysters and a
pint of stout?

Ivy very meaningly puts a second glass on the tray.

He turns to the crowd as another chorus of the song starts.

CHAIRMAN

Everybody now! All together! “Oh!
Champagne Charlie is my --!'

He leads the crowd as they all start to sing.
PAN SHOT - IVY 190

As she approaches box. She adopts a casual air, singing as
she goes, pretending little interest in the man in the box
o.S., aS WE PAN HER UP the steps and around into the box.

She puts down tray as Hyde looks at her avidly. She has not
yet got a good look at him, only sensing his expensive attire,
as she opens the bottle and sings at the same time. Then she
turns as though to smile casually at the customer, and gets
Hyde's full look, sees him for the first time, and stops
singing, staring at him. Then she looks away, starts singing
again, only not very happily now, and then pours only one
glass, as she finally ceases singing entirely. The song stops,
and there are applause and shouts o.s.

IVY
(wanting to get away)
That'll be half a quid, sir.

HYDE
(giving her a note)
Here's a sovereign, my dear... the
change is yours.

IVY
(impressed)
Thank you, sir.

Yet she looks at him again and still decides to go. Hyde
gets up quickly and touches her elbow.

HYDE
Oh, but now! You brought two glasses.
You must have had the same thought
as I. What a nice beginning, eh?

edges her into it)
Sit down, my dear - yes - sit down....

him)
I'll take just a sip. Then I'll have
to go back because I'm --

HYDE
Nonsense - we've got all evening,
little Ivy. I like your singing.
You'll have to sing for me some more.
Where did you get such a pretty

voice....?
IVY
(fooling with glass)
Why - I dunno.... I just --
HYDE

Is it because of the pretty place it
comes from -?

(starting to touch

under her chin)
That's very lovely.... where it comes
from....

Ivy quickly picks up her glass, to interfere with his gesture.

IVY
Well - good - good luck, sir.

HYDE
I make my own luck, my dear --
(lifting his glass to
her)
And tonight I follow the rainbow....

IVY
(with a nervous laugh) You do talk,
don't you?

HYDE
(leaning closer to
her)
We'll follow it together, eh?

He holds her gaze for a second. Then:
IVY

(decisively)
I follow it right home, mister.

To what end, my dear? That fetid
stable you call home? You - with
your young radiance -- are happy
living in that rat-trap?

IVY
(pertly)
What do you expect? Buckingham Palace?

Hyde throws back his head and laughs.

HYDE
Touche', my dear. I like that!

IVY
(suddenly)
Here! How do you know where I live?

HYDE
(caught )
Why, I --
(then, easily)
I can only imagine. I'll warrant
your wages here won't afford you a
mansion in Kensington.

IVY

Well, I must be off because --

HYDE

(holding her arm)
Why? You act frightened of me, little
Ivy....

(rising with her,

still holding her

arm - softly)
You mustn't be frightened of me....

Ivy stares at him a second, almost in a spell because of his
voice and touch. Then, she suddenly wrenches herself away.

IvY
(as she does so)
I ain't afraid of nobody - but leggo,
you hear?

At this point, the first man who was at the bar, enters. He
is quite tight and annoyed. He grabs Ivy's other arm.

at the bar, who has followed the first. The latter is quite

drunk.

man)
He insulted the poor child! He mauled

For answer the second man swings on the first and knocks him
over the rail of the box and onto a table, beneath where sit
four or five men and a couple of girls. The place goes in an

uproar.

2ND MAN
(leaning over rail,
to first)
You will, eh?

Hyde's eyes light up at the fracas. He shoves the second man
over the low rail with a lightning movement, and stands
laughing at the turmoil below.

FULL SHOT - FIGHT 191

It starts as one of the men swings on the first who has

fallen.

AD LIB
Here! What's the idea? Give it to
him, Fred! wh're you shovin'? Let

The fight becomes general in the area below Hyde's box, as
he watches gleefully. Women scream. Glasses and bottles crash.

He jumps up and down at the rail, watching the fight like an
animal, gleefully giggling as he sees the heavy punching and
falling. At one point a man is backed up against the rail.
Hyde puts his foot through and kicks him sprawling.

PAN SHOT - MANAGER 193

The fat little man comes hurrying into the fight, elbowing
his way through.

MANAGER
(calling over his
shoulder)
Fred - Joe -!
(to fighting crowd)
Here, here now - stop this! I'll
stop it!

As he comes abreast of Hyde, Hyde's eyes gleam as he spies
the Manager's. Then, with elaborate but quick prankishness,
Hyde uses his stick like a billiard cue, shooting it on the
rail, letting the manager have it right in the side of the
eye, then jumps up and down with laughter as the manager
goes down, and we -

The manager is applying a cold towel and a piece of raw meat
to his eye which is quite puffed. In the b.g. through the
door, we see the activity of the place. Hyde watches him.

MANAGER
.. frightful. We run a very orderly
hall here. I don't understand what
happened.

HYDE
Ir's that girl, Ivy... that barmaid.
Girls like that always cause trouble.
You should discharge her.

customers in here --

yes - I think you're quite right,
sir. Trouble-maker, that's what she
is. Out she goes, sir.

putting the money in his pocket, as we

He slams the door in her face and she comes toward the CAMERA,
flouncing her indignation. As she gets opposite the cab,
Hyde steps out and confronts her.

on seat)
No, no... you don't belong in there,

CLOSE SHOT - IVY - INT. NEW APARTMENT 202

She is a different Ivy than we last saw. She seems to be
down, dull, beaten, some of her native young impudence and
freshness gone. She is playing a game of solitaire. She makes
a move, and winces a little, feels her shoulder, then plays
on dully, as WE DRAW BACK to show her new surroundings, a
rather rich, gaudy and heavy parlor of the period. In the
b.g. beyond folding doors thrown open, is the bedroom and
dressing table. AS WE SWING AROUND we see the front door on
a landing and then a few steps with rail descend into the
parlor. The door opens and Ivy jumps up quickly, stiffening,
then relaxes and tries to cover up as an older girl ina
peignoir and slippers comes in.

IVY

Oh, hello, Marcia.

MARCIA

deck and shuffles,

up and does the same)

He closes the door and comes down the steps into the room.
He takes off his hat and gloves and cape. He slowly walks

about her temple. It sticks there. She tries to laugh, as
she picks it out. Then she quickly gets up and exits from

Why! It's such a pretty song!

starting to sob)
Oh, please, sir - not tonight!

HYDE

IVY

Oh, sir - whatever you like - but

With a lightning-like movement, his gentle taunting turns to
a fierce, vicious command as he pinches her chin between his
thumb and fore-finger. His eyes widen in fury.

HYDE
I said sing!

IVY
(with almost a scream)
But, sir -!

HYDE
Sing it! You hear me?

Ivy slowly nods, looks about a little hysterically, backs
away a little, as if to an accustomed position before him,
and pathetically, between sobs, starts to sing a version of
Champagne Charlie in which she substitutes the words
"Champagne Ivy is my name..."

He leans forward on the table, watching her with horrible,
rising satisfaction, swaying slightly to the music.

That's it! Smile when you sing! Be
gay! Be happy!

With this he picks up a bunch of grapes and throws them at
her. They smash against her breast, leaving a huge smear. He
leaps over at her, as WE DOLLY IN CLOSE. His voice is now
low and rampant with desire, as he enfolds her in his arms.

HYDE
Congratulations, my dear!... the
world is yours! The moment is

Mine -!

She tries to pull away from him, but he pulls her in to him
savagely, and kisses her. She all but faints under it, and
wilts in his arms, her whole body sagging. He looks down at
her, pulls her arms about his neck, lifts her up, with a
look 0.s., as we

FULL SHOT - EXT. BACK DOOR OF LAB - NIGHT 207

Hyde hurries into scene as WE DOLLY IN. He looks left and
right, [...], then unlooks the door and ducks in.

FULL SHOT - INT. LAB 208

Hyde lights gas lamps, then takes off his cape and hat, then
quickly goes to [...], picks out a vial, comes to table and
pours contents into a glass. He looks about crazily for a
second, then drinks it. He gets the same violent reaction as
from the "outward" phase. He writhes, grips table, etc., but
the change is much quicker than when he changes to Hyde.

Now, before our eyes, he becomes Dr. Jekyll. He seems sagging,
spent. He goes quickly to the mirror and looks at himself,

as WE DOLLY IN. He peers at, feels, his face anxiously, then
looks at his hands. Then he looks at himself in disgust, and
covers his face with his hands. He paces about a bit, silently
berating himself, his lips moving, his fist pounding the
table. He takes the back-door key out of his pocket, looks

at it, then over at the back-door. He makes a firm decision,
goes quickly to a small gas smelter, lights it, puts ina
chunk of lead, holds the key in his hand, waiting. Suddenly,
there is a knock on the door, o.s., from house.

coat and slippers.

POOLE

I saw the light. I'm so glad you're
back, Dr. Jekyll. I was worried,
sir. You'll pardon my appearance.

JEKYLL
I was called on an emergency. I stayed
at the house.

POOLE
Yes, sir. Oh, Dr. Lanyon called twice
today, sir - he said to tell you
that Miss Beatrix and her father
arrive home in the morning, sir.

JEKYLL

In the morning?

POOLE
Yes, sir.

No, guv'nor.

Freddie gives the messenger a coin, and comes down, handing
the envelope to Ivy. She opens it, as they watch. She pulls
out a sheaf of bank notes.

IVY

Look here -!
MARCIA

counting notes)
I say! Fifty pounds.

(looking in envelope)
But there's no letter with it. This
from him...?

FREDDIE
The blighter must've sent it for
what he's done.

IVY
Not him - the rotten skinflint - and
he don't care nohow...

MARCIA
(finding a solution,
practical)
Well - no matter who sent it, it's
here. And it's more than enough to
get you out of the country.

FREDDIE
Jolly good idea! I've got a friend
in Paris who'll be only too glad to --

Interesting.

Father, Harry won't admit it. But
because he was so upset, he's been
very ill while we were away -

SIR CHARLES
Oh, I'm sorry, my boy - feeling fit
again?

JEKYLL

With Bee back, sir? Well!

BEATRIX

And this leads me to speak very

BEATRIX

Father, I respect you more than any
girl could. But Harry and I - we've

I'll give you some lotion to soothe
that.

But Ivy stops him quickly. She begins to break down more.

IVY

Lotion! It won't be lotions'1ll do
the trick, sir! No! It's more than
that, sir. I need help, I do! I can't
stand it any more!

(as Jekyll can only

look at her)
It's Hyde, sir - a man I know - Mr.
Hyde, sir! It's him as done it, and
more I can't tell you, sir. He ain't
human, he ain't. He's a beast! He
won't let me go, sir! And I'm afraid
to - I'm afraid to run away....

During this he has slumped down on arm of chair. She continues
to explain.

IVY

Marcia - she's my girl friend - and
Freddie, Mr. Willoughby - he's her
friend... they says it's my nerves -
and they says as how you know about
such things and could help me, sir.

you're thinking about, he does!
Why, if he knows I've been here today,
I don't know what he'll do. It won't
be nothin' human, I can tell you!
Oh, please, sir - please help me.
Keep him off -!

(in a lower voice,

hastily - pleading)
I'll do anything you ask, sir - I
ain't as bad as you might think -and -
and men say as I ain't a bad looker
when I'm more myself. You - you liked
me once a little, didn't you, sir?
And you're really such a fine kind
gentleman - honest - that night you
walked out of my place, I laughed at
you - but I didn't laugh after you'd
gone...

puts her cheek on

his knee)
I kept wishin' you'd come back -

second, he seems as though he is about to lean over and

volume and vehemence. He suddenly realizes what he is
whistling and stops it, a shadow crossing his face. Then he
smiles again, starts whistling "Drink To Me Only With Thine
Eyes", but before he realizes it, he is whistling "Champagne
Charlie" again. He stops short in his tracks, as he realizes
this. His hand passes over his brow. He tries to walk on,

He seems to be trying to get his breath. He rings his finger

His face suddenly becomes strained and panic-stricken. His
hand goes to his throat. His face starts to contort more,
the lines deepening. With horror, his glance goes to his
hands. WE PAN DOWN. His hand, clutching the bench, is turning
more horribly grotesque than we have ever seen it. WE PAN
BACK UP. Jekyll is now nearing the change to Hyde! He looks
at his other hand. WE PAN DOWN. It is the same as the other.
WE PAN BACK UP to his face. It is almost that of Hyde. He is
in convulsions.

JEKYLL

cry)
Bee - Bee, darling -!

Then the writhings and gaspings, their course running quicker
than before. And suddenly, he is Hyde! He looks about,
craftily, viciously. A bird lights on the bench beside him.
He flails his cane at it. It flies away. He thinks a second,
getting his bearings in Evil. Then a thought strikes him.

His eyes glint. He starts to sing "Champagne Charlie" ina
horrible sing-song, swaying manner, and suddenly he gets up
with an animal leap, and WE PAN HIM as he runs leaping across
the green into the b.g., like a gorged buzzard racing for
another piece of carrion, as we --

Here's hoping that Hyde rots wherever

passionately)
And here's hoping that Dr. Jekyll

"cause he's an angel. Here's to my

her)
He's the sort of man you get down on
your knees to, isn't he? -- A sweet,
dear, pure man you could believe and
trust...

(suddenly grabs her

wrist viciously)
He's a smug hypocritical coward,
that's what he is!

IVY
You - you couldn't know Dr. Jekyll --
know him intimately. I detest him

intimately -- from his lofty brain
to the soles of his virtuous feet.
And you -
HYDE

"I'll do anything you ask, sir -"
(snarling again)

Well, you saw the respectable fool!

Clutched his halo and held it

straight, didn't he?

IVY
How - how'd you know all that?

HYDE
Why I know everything you say and
everything you think.

IVY
Then you - you must be truly somethin' -
the devil himself, then... because

Dr. Jekyll wouldn't tell you. He
ain't the kind that would -

HYDE
S-s-h! Would you keep a secret if I
told you? Promise?

IVY

wall)
No - no -
HYDE

(wagging his finger

at her - following)
But you don't have to promise. Because
it's such a beautiful secret that
those who share it with me can't go
on living.

IVY
What - what are you going to do?

HYDE
(softly)
How does one usually stop a person
from living?

He makes a lunge at her, but she ducks from under him,
wrenches away from his grasp and, screaming, runs across
room, up the stair. Hyde gives a roar of glee and rage, leaps
over balustrade and intercepts her, as WE PAN. WE PAN BACK

as she runs screaming across the room, trying to get toa
window. Hyde leaps back and grabs her as she reaches divan.

EFFECT SHOT - SHOOTING OVER DIVAN 224
Hyde grabs her by the throat, bends her back.

IVY
(wild in her terror)
No - please, sir - I'll sing for
you, I will -

"Champagne Ivy is my name. Champagne
Ivy is --"

Her voice chokes off.

Now! Now you've got what you've
longed for!

After a second there is silence. Hyde gets up gasping. He
looks about, looks back at form below FRAME, and then WE PAN
as he picks up his hat and stick and starts for the door.
O.s. in the hall, we hear inaudible but growing murmurs.

FULL SHOT - UPPER HALL AND STAIR WELL 225

An elderly woman and her husband, and a couple of other
tenants are looking fearfully at Ivy's door. Marcia and
Freddie, both in evening dress, are hurrying up the stairs.

WOMAN
(down to them)
Somethin's happened! He's latherin'
the hide off her!

FREDDIE
(to man above)
Come on - we better pop in and stop
it!

At this moment, Hyde comes out the door on the run, stops as
he sees them.

MAN
Hey, you - what've you been -?

He gets no further as Hyde brushes him aside with a roar,
careens down the stairs to Freddie and Marcia.

WOMAN
Stop him, the dirty -!

Freddie tries to grapple with Hyde, but Hyde knocks him down
with a blow from his cane, and as WE PAN, leaps over the
balustrade with a laugh in time to avoid other tenants who
come rushing up the stairs. In the b.g., below, he ducks out
of the door.

FULL PAN SHOT - EXT. STREET 226

Hyde comes out of the door, darts off down the street. A
couple of passers-by turn around and look at him as he leaves
the sidewalk, ducks across in front of a cab, hitting the
horse with his cane so that it rears and plunges, and then
disappears around a corner.

other tenants are looking horrified down at a constable who
is kneeling over Ivy's body o.s. Marcia, hard Marcia, is
sobbing. Freddie has his handkerchief to a bloody temple.

WOMAN
(in awe)
He done her in! How horrible!

CONSTABLE

This here's the work of a friend!

MARCIA

It was that Hyde did it, I tell you!

The constable turns, jumps to the window, opens it, starts
blowing his whistle vigorously.

Hyde hurries into scene, looks about with triumphant little
chuckles, as he fumbles in his pockets for the key. WE DOLLY
IN. Then Hyde realizes he has destroyed the key. He tries
the heavy door with his shoulder, tries again. He gives up,
looks around, then WE PAN HIM as he darts along sidewalk to
corner, turns, and disappears.

FULL SHOT - AT FRONT CORNER 229

Hyde comes running from back corner full tilt, and WE PAN
HIM, after he peers around front corner of his house, along
front of house to entrance and the door, in far b.g.

CLOSE SHOT - AT FRONT DOOR - HYDE 230

He pulls out the wire plunger bell, frantically, then bangs
the heavy brass knocker on the door. He flies into a flurry
of animal rage in his impatience. Then the door opens about
a foot, held in that position by the heavy safety chain
stretching from jamb to door on the inside, and Poole's
startled face peers out. He withdraws a little at the man he
sees.

HYDE

Come - open up, you fool! I'ma friend
of Dr. Jekyll!

POOLE
D-D-Doctor Jekyll isn't at home,
sir...

Poole tries to close door but Hyde pushes his foot in, wedging
it open.

HYDE
Well, that doesn't make any -!
(then recovering)
What difference does that make? He
expects me! He told me to wait for
him, you idiot! Let me in!

POOLE

I know all of Dr. Jekyll's
friends -!
HYDE
Now look here - I'll have no insolent
talk like -
POOLE
You'll have to come back later.
HYDE
You open up or I'll bash this door
in!
POOLE
If you don't go away, I'll send for
the police!

As he says this, he stamps on Hyde's foot. Hyde withdraws

it, allowing Poole to slam the door closed. Then with an
inarticulate growl, Hyde looks about him for something. WE

PAN DOWN AND UP with him, as with superhuman strength, he
wrenches a foot scraper embedded in the brick stoop. He is
just about to use it to jimmy open the door between the handle
and the jamb, when he does a "double take" and looks o.s.

LONG SHOT - BOBBIE - HYDE'S ANGLE 231
Far down at the corner, he is just emerging into view,

strolling along the street at right angles to Hyde. He stops

and leans against a light post, folding his arms for a rest.

scraper, tiptoes o.s.

FULL SHOT - CHEAP COMMERCIAL SECTION - STREET 234

The street is empty. In the far background, across the street,
we see the skulking figure of Hyde, looking in the various
shops as he hurries along.

CLOSE PAN SHOT - HYDE 235

He seems to be searching for a certain shop, passing a
butcher's, a shoemaker's, a wine shop, a plumbing shop, notion
store, etc., peering into each with a sort of desperation.
Finally, o.s. ahead of him, he sees what he wants. His face
lights up. He is just about to start for it, when he looks
down the street o.s., from where we hear the sound of trotting
hooves. He ducks into a dark recess, watches.

PAN SHOT - HIS ANGLE - TWO MOUNTED BOBBIES 236
They trot down the street, looking this way and that.
BACK TO HYDE 237

He watches them o.s., as the sound of their horses' hooves
disappears. Then WE DOLLY AND PAN HIM as he hurries a few
paces down the black street until he comes opposite a store
window which reads: "Grundy & Co. Stationery Supplies". He
peers in the window.

CLOSE SHOT - HYDE'S ANGLE - STATIONERY, INK AND PENS. 238
They are on display.
BACK TO HYDE 239

He tries the door of the shop; of course, it isn't open. He
looks about, sees a newspaper rack - a heavy wooden standard -
seizes it, raises it above his head and smashes the window
with it. He reaches in and snags paper, ink bottle, pen.
Envelopes and paper scatter over the walk. Almost immediately,
a light goes on in back of the store as a door opens and a
man and his wife and an older woman rush into the front part
of store. Hyde is now scooting up the sidewalk toward the

b.g. The store folk come out, in nightclothes, viewing the
wreckage, spying Hyde darting up the street.

I've heard strange things about this young Jekyll... after
all, that affair at the embassy... felt so sorry for poor
Beatrix." WE PAN ACROSS this to pick up Sir Charles and

people leaving in

I talked to Poole. Dr. Jekyll left
the house at seven to come here.
He's very worried, sir.

That is all, Hobson. Thank you.

hat, he picks up an

envelope from the

There was a ring at the door a short

Lanyon takes it quickly, opens it. Two keys are inside, with
a note.

bush. Lanyon steps back, startled. He holds vial case under
his cloak.

Well, well - have you got it?

Now come, Lanyon - let's not waste

difference does -?

DR. LANYON

Are you an acquaintance of Jekyll?
HYDE

Of course. I'ma friend - an old

friend.

hand, his voice rising)
But if you even pretend to be his
friend you'll forego your asinine
amenities and let me have that before -

Oh, don't worry - he's alive - he -

a snarl)

You pretentious fool -!

But his expression changes as Lanyon whips a revolver out of
the drawer and covers him.

DR. LANYON

I warn you, Hyde. If you make one
step toward the door I'll shoot you
right between the eyes.

HYDE

feeling)
Now wait a moment, Lanyon - I can't
let you come with me - and I can't
tell you any more than I've already -

DR. LANYON
Why not?

HYDE
Because - well -

I warn you not to stick your nose

it tomorrow if you want to!

mad. When the potion is all mixed, Hyde picks up the glass

and faces Lanyon. The potion boils and steams a little.

HYDE
Once more - will you let me take
this glass and leave?

DR. LANYON
(tense, still with
revolver )
No. This will be seen through to the
end.
HYDE

You'd better think again, Lanyon. Do
you want to live on as you have...
lulled in your blissful cocoon of
ignorance? Or do you want that safe
peace of mind - your reason even -
blasted by a sight that would shock
the lowest fiend in the Inferno?

DR. LANYON
(getting an awful
feeling, but game)
You can't persuade me with all that
mad babbling! Whatever you're going
to do - get on with it!

HYDE
Very well, Lanyon. But remember your
vows to your profession. You'll see
a secret you are sworn not to
reveal...you who have sneered at the
powers of science - you who have
laughed at man's ability to dissect
his own soul! Watch this, you pompous
ass! Watch this!

HE HOLDS THE GLASS HIGH... 248

contortions, falls back into a chair. As the metamorphosis

a small flagged veranda which leads from French windows of

the drawing room to the flower garden. The garden centers
about a small fountain and is set off with flower-bed patterns
and marble benches.

266 CLOSE SHOT - JEKYLL - EXT. FRENCH DOORS 266

He peers through them in the b.g. We see Beatrix playing the
piano, a sad and worried expression on her face. Back of
her, and to one side, Sir Charles nods in a chair over a
paper.

CLOSE SHOT - JEKYLL - REVERSE ANGLE 267
We are on his tortured countenance for a second as he looks

o.s. at Beatrix. He half raises his hand as though to call
her attention by the movement.
136.

268 FULL SHOT - BEATRIX - OVER JEKYLL'S SHOULDER THROUGH FRENCH 268
DOORS

She suddenly sees him. She falters in her playing for a
second. Jekyll puts his finger to his lips. She continues
playing and finishes her piece very softly, watching Sir
Charles over her shoulder, who by now is quite asleep. Then
she gets up and hurries as quickly as possible without making
any noise to the French doors, opens them, and comes out to
Jekyll, closing the doors quietly.

BEATRIX
(seeing his strained
look)
Harry - dearest -

JEKYLL
(nodding toward garden)
Will you come out - where we can
talk?

She gives him a worried look, and then precedes him out into
the garden.

269 MED. SHOT - BEATRIX AND JEKYLL 269

As they come into SCENE, near a marble bench. He is greatly
agitated. He doesn't know where to begin. Beatrix sits down
on the bench. She indicates the place beside her.

BEATRIX
Sit down, darling - what's happened?
What's wrong?

Jekyll sits down, staring at the ground, wringing his hands.
For a moment, there is silence between them.

JEKYLL
(bursting out suddenly)
Bee -- I - I've been thinking --

about us. I think your father's been
right all along....

BEATRIX
About what?

JEKYLL
I - I don't think we should ever
marry, that's all. I - I realized
it, last night. And - and I think
you ought to break it off.

(CONTINUED)
269 CONTINUED:

BEATRIX
(slowly, unable to
believe)
What are you trying to tell me, Harry?
You don't know what you're saying...
look at me -!

JEKYLL
(his face averted)
Really, Bee --

BEATRIX
(pulling his shoulders
around)
Look at me, darling -!

JEKYLL
I mean - no matter how perfect things
seem at first - people make mistakes,

sometimes.
BEATRIX
(tears welling in her
eyes)
But, Harry...

(then, with the
horrible thought)
Oh... I see. You don't want me. You
don't love me any more. Is that it?
(stifling a sob)
Are you telling me you don't want
me?

JEKYLL

(wildly, breaking)
Want you? I love you and want you
more than --

(rises quickly, walks

away )
But I'm giving you up, do you hear?
I'm not worth even the sound of your
name!

Beatrix gets up and hurries to him as WE PAN.

BEATRIX
Oh, my darling - what's wrong? Tell
me!

JEKYLL
I've no right to you - I've thrown
it away!

BEATRIX

Nothing's done that can't be --

(CONTINUED)
269 CONTINUED:

138.
(2) 269

JEKYLL
But it's done! I've destroyed paradise -
Our paradise -

BEATRIX
(the mother now)
Oh - you are ill - tell me what's
really wrong! Don't keep it pent up
inside. You've always said we could
discuss anything between us.

JEKYLL

There are things you can't voice in
Heaven. Just believe me...

(turning his back to

her)
You're giving me up, do you hear? Go -
go inside - now - while I can't see
you -!

BEATRIX
(turning him half to
her)
Darling - it's all right. Just take
me in your arms.

JEKYLL
Oh, don't my angel! Angel - Angel of
Heaven, don't say any more -!

BEATRIX
(putting her arms
around him)
There - there, darling - hold me
close. Don't think of anything - of
whatever it is - just hold me a

minute.
JEKYLL
(pulling her hand
from him)
No! No - I can't! I'd give my soul
to -- but I have no soul!

(he clenches his fist
and covers his face
with the other hand,
bowing his head)

I'm like -
(he pauses, searching
for the word)

- like the living dead...!

Beatrix now enfolds him in her arms again. His head rests on
her shoulder. His arms go around her, weakened for a moment
in his anguish.

(CONTINUED)
139.
269 CONTINUED: (3) 269

BEATRIX
(soothingly)
Oh, my poor dear suffering love. Be
quiet... s-s-h-don't say any more.

JEKYLL
(sobbing)
Oh, Bee - my darling -!

BEATRIX
(softly)
Rest now... rest...

They are quiet for a second. Then Jekyll lifts his head
quickly and starts as if to leave.

BEATRIX
(trying to hold him,
panicky)
I won't let you go. You love me - I
won't let you go.

JEKYLL

(his voice rising)
That's why I'm giving you up! Because
I'll love you till the end of time!

(raising his gaze

aloft, as he backs

away, Beatrix staring

after him aghast

that he is going,

that she can't hold

him)
This is my proof! This is my penance!

He turns and walks hurriedly o.s.

BEATRIX
(starting after him,
then stops)
Harry - come back - Harry --

She then breaks into violent sobs, falters, and sinks to the
ground, prone.

FULL SHOT - END OF GARDEN 270

Jekyll is hurrying toward the CAMERA. In the b.g., Beatrix

is sobbing on the ground. WE PAN Jekyll as he comes around
the side of the house and stops. 0.s. he hears her sobbing,
faintly. He is terribly tempted to go back. He half turns

and looks. He cannot stand the sight of what he sees. He
leans in weary torture against the side of the house, closing
his eyes. Suddenly a look of horror comes over his face. He
looks down at his hands. WE PAN DOWN to see his hand starting
to change. WE PAN UP to Jekyll's face. He looks down at his
other hand. His throat starts to constrict, his face to
change.

JEKYLL
(wildly, looking up)
Oh - no - no - don't let me - save
me - don't let me -!

But the metamorphosis is well on its way.
CLOSE SHOT - BEATRIX 271

She still lies on the ground, sobbing. Then, Jekyll's feet
and legs appear slowly in the SCENE. They stand right next
to her. She is aware of them. With a little sob, she half
rises, reaches out and enfolds the legs, pressing her cheek
against the knees.

BEATRIX
(murmuring)
Oh, you did come back... Oh, my
darling....

For answer there is an ugly chuckle o.s. Hyde's hands come
down into the frame and clutch her arms. Beatrix in
puzzlement, and then in dawning horror reacts to the chuckle
and the hands. In almost the same moment, Hyde lifts her up
and she is face to face with him. For a second, she is frozen
with fright, then screams as Hyde's face bends towards hers.

BEATRIX
(after her scream)
Father! Father..!

Hyde laughs wildly and starts to struggle with Beatrix.

FULL PAN SHOT - SIR CHARLES 272

He is coming out of the drawing room on a dead run. WE PAN
HIM over to Beatrix and Hyde. Hyde drops Beatrix who faints
and slips to the ground. Sir Charles makes a gallant lunge
at Hyde, but Hyde sends him reeling against the wall. Then
with a wild animal laugh he leaps for his hat and stick. Sir
Charles, however, recovers in time to intercept his progress
around the fountain.

SIR CHARLES
(calling)
Help! Hobson - call the police!
Help -!

Hyde raises his stick and lays it across Sir Charles' head.
Sir Charles stumbles back and falls to the ground. Hyde leaps
on top of him like a panther, and bashes the stick against
Sir Charles' head three or four times in rapid succession.
The stick breaks with a final sickening blow. In the b.g.
Hobson and a footman come hurrying from the drawing room.

FOOTMAN
Here - what's going on -!
They spy Hyde and come after him. Hyde gets up and WE PAN
HIM the length of the garden on the run. Hobson kneels beside
Sir Charles' prostrate body as the footman gives chase after
Hyde around the corner of the house.
FULL SHOT - FRONT GATE 273

Hyde comes running from the garden. He stops for a second
and looks up the street.

EFFECT SHOT - JEKYLL'S ANGLE 274

A constable comes around the corner on the run, dimly
discernible under a gas light.

BACK TO HYDE 275

He runs o.s. down the street in the opposite direction just
as the footman appears and the constable comes running up.

FOOTMAN
(pointing in direction
of Hyde)
There he goes! It's the monster!

The constable runs o.s. after Hyde, blowing his whistle.

FULL SHOT - MEWS 276
Hyde comes tearing down in toward camera. In a second, the
constable appears after him. Another man or two, passers-by

at the far entrance, take up the chase. Hyde leaps over a

fence. When the constable arrives at fence, he blows his

whistle again.

FULL SHOT - ANOTHER CONSTABLE - AT CORNER 277
He reacts to distant whistle, runs for it o.s.

LONG SHOT - HYDE - ANOTHER STREET 278
He runs past camera into b.g. A small group of idlers are
standing at the corner. They block his progress and he bowls
through them, knocking a couple down. Ad 1ib yells of surprise
and anger.

REVERSE SHOT - STREET 279
The two constables come in chase, followed by more people.

1ST CONSTABLE
Stop that man!

GROUP SHOT - AT CORNER 280
As constables come running up.
1ST MAN

That way, constable!

WE PAN AND PICK UP Hyde, his cape flying, leaping down the
street in the b.g. The rest give chase.

FULL PAN SHOT - HYDE - JEKYLL'S STREET 281

He comes flying along and darts up the walk to the house.
O.s. comes the sound of the constable's whistle.

CLOSE SHOT - HYDE - AT JEKYLL'S FRONT DOOR 282
He runs up the steps, vaults the balustrade and hurls his

body sidewise through the waiting-room window at the side of

the door.

FULL SHOT - INT. WAITING-ROOM 283

Hyde lands sprawling amidst the shattered glass. He scrambles
up and leaps out into the foyer.

FULL SHOT - INT. FOYER - JEKYLL'S HOUSE 284
Hyde enters. Poole comes in from past camera.
POOLE
(recognizing Hyde)
Here, here - how did -?
But he gets no further as Hyde, with a roar, bowls him aside
and ducks out the back door toward the lab. Poole hurries to
the door, opens it. 0.s. we hear crowd noises and whistles.
PAN EFFECT SHOT - HYDE 285

As he leaps across the bridge in the back courtyard to
Jekyll's laboratory.

FULL SHOT - INT. SMALL HALL - INT. LAB BUILDING 286
Hyde comes through door from courtyard, closes door, locks

it. Then he goes to door of lab, opens it, ducks inside, and

we hear him lock this door.

EXT. COURTYARD 287
Poole and the constables come running across the bridge.

POOLE
He's gone into the laboratory!

WE PAN THEM to the first door. They find it locked.
1ST CONSTABLE
(putting shoulder to
door)
Heave, Bill!
CLOSE SHOT - HYDE - INT. LAB 288

He is frantically looking for various vials to mix the potion.
He upsets and breaks things in his fury.

DR. LANYON
(taking stick, then
after a second)
Yes... I was afraid so.
(rising)
Come - I think I can take you to
your man.

DISSOLVE TO:
INT. LAB 292

Hyde is feverishly mixing the potion, having to make some of
its ingredients not already prepared. O.s., there is a crash
of door bursting. Then hammering on the laboratory door.

FULL SHOT - INT. HALL OF LAB 293

The courtyard door is down. The constables and Poole are
hammering at the door of the lab.

CLOSE SHOT - HYDE - INT. LAB 294
In his haste, he knocks over a large glass jar. It crashes.
BACK TO CONSTABLES AND POOLE - HALL 295

1ST CONSTABLE
(suddenly listening)
He's in there! Open up!
(then, as just silence
comes)
Come on, Bill!

Bill has run in with a crow-bar, and after two or three tries,
they break the door down.

PAN SHOT - POOLE AND CONSTABLES - INT. LAB 296

They come running down the stairs. As WE PAN WE PICK UP Jekyll
who is just staggering to his feet from the floor.

POOLE
(amazed)
Dr. Jekyll, sir! That frightful maniac
broke through the house and -

JEKYLL
I know. He struck me over the head.
(indicating, to
constable)
Quick, man! He went out by the back!

(CONTINUED)
145.

296 CONTINUED: 296
The constables hurry to the back door, o.s.

POOLE
I didn't even know you were home,
sir. Are you badly hurt?

JEKYLL
I'll - I'll be all right.

The two constables come from the back door.

1ST CONSTABLE
(to Jekyll)
This here door's locked.

JEKYLL
(impatiently, pointing
up stairs)
Then you better get round through
the front!

The two constables leap up the stairs, just as Lanyon, another
constable and an inspector in plain clothes come hurrying
in.

DR. LANYON
(looking at Jekyll
below)
Wait!

1ST CONSTABLE
(explaining)
He ducked through the back and locked
the door after him!

DR. LANYON
(in great strain)
No, he didn't! He's still down here.

They watch him, amazed, and follow down the steps to the lab
proper. He approaches Jekyll. Jekyll looks at him, tired,
wan. There are tears in Jekyll's eyes as he waits for the
word by Lanyon. Lanyon, too, is greatly affected. He seems
as though he can't say the word.

DR. LANYON
(finally gathers
himself - pointing
to Jekyll)
There - Heaven help him.

now)
I know. Nevertheless, there's your
man.

INSPECTOR
You can't be serious, Dr. Lanyon. I -

DR. LANYON
(suddenly pointing)
Watch -!

For Jekyll has already started to turn back to Hyde again.
They all watch him in awe and horror as he goes through the
metamorphosis.

CLOSE SHOT - POOLE 297
He backs away slowly.

CLOSE SHOT - CONSTABLES AND INSPECTOR 298
Their jaws are dropping.

CLOSE SHOT - LANYON 299
He looks away. He cannot stand it.

CLOSE SHOT - HYDE 300

For he is now almost completely Hyde. He comes out of his
writhings as such. He looks about at the others, as though

he has just seen them for the first time. He is more bestial
and awful in physique and manner than we have ever seen him
in the transformation. With a sudden yell he throws a huge
jar at the officers, and ducks around the table. (NOTE: In
the following ensuing struggle ad lib commands from the
inspector should come at the proper time: "Grab him - hold
him - don't let him get up those stairs - guard that door"....
etc.) Hyde practically wrecks the lab in eluding his pursuers.
He knocks them this way and that. He leaps across tables -

up on shelves, pulling them down. He growls and snarls and
laughs in glee every time he eludes them.

CLOSE SHOT - LANYON AND INSPECTOR 301

This during middle of fight. Lanyon sees the gun in the
inspector's hand.

(darting o.s.)
Hold him now!

FULL SHOT - GROUP 302

The constables seem just about to have Hyde cornered, when
with another wild leap, he gets to a set of surgical
instruments, and pulls out a large knife. With another yell,
he makes a leap for freedom, brandishing his weapon. As he
gets by the large apparatus on the table, the inspector lets
him have it with the revolver. Hyde wheels, drops across the
table, shattering some of the apparatus. They start crowding
around him in silent awe, Poole crying with audible sobs.

POOLE
(like a plea)
Dr. Jekyll... Dr. Jekyll..... !

CLOSE SHOT - HYDE'S HEAD - PROFILE 303

There is a strange light on it. As if in answer to Poole's
plea, the face starts slowly and mystically changing back to
that of the handsome Jekyll - a face peaceful in death - as
if in death - without struggle or torture - Jekyll was
restored to himself for Eternity. WE PULL BACK SLOWLY for a
tableau.

DR. LANYON
