FADE IN.
EXT, ACRE HARBOR - DUSK 1

Skyline of mosques and ancient towers is a vicious red, Lit
py weakened rays of the setting sun. CAMERA PANS ACROSS the
walls of the old Crusader city and DOWN to the harbor. A
jeep comes to a halt at the far end,

BUGENHAGEN, @ once powerful man in his late fifties, with
heavy shoulders and bull neck, climbs painfully out. His
hair and beard are now white. His face is drawn and anxious.
He picks up a small, dusty leather box and some newspape:rs
and limps towards one of the harbor cafes.

EXT, CAFE.- DUSK 2

The sea smacks against the rocks below the cafe terrace,
Beyond, small boys dive from the ruined walls once defended
by the Crusaders,

Inside, sitting alone, is MICHAEL MORGAN. He sips his
Turkish coffee and brandy and turns the page of his book.

A precise man, Morgan, English, in his fifties, a respected
archaeologist.

Bugenhagen hobbles through the doors and approaches his

friend, Morgan looks up over his half-glasses and sees

Bugenhagen, He stands, obviously surprised to see him,

CAMERA REMAINS OUTSIDE to WATCH them exchange greetings.

INT, CAFE ~ DUSK 3
Bugenhagen thrusts newspaper in front of Morgan. His finger

strikes headline: "U.S, AMBASSADOR AND WIFE BURIED TOGETHER
IN LONDON,"

BUGENHAGEN
Have you seen this?
MORGAN
(takes a cursory look
and nods)
Yes. Very curious. .

Bugenhagen places another newspaper in front of him. The
headline is: "PRESIDENT AND WIFE COMFORT BEREAVED .
AMBASSADOR'S SON," He stabs at the photograph of a young hoy.

No.

BUGENHAGEN
Haven't you seen YIGAEL'S WALL

MORGAN

They only uncovered it last week, I ~--

BUGENHAGEN

The face of Yigael's Satan as a

Morgan stares at his old friend, worried for him --

MORGAN
Carl --

BUGENHAGEN
You must believe me[

MORGAN

{calmiy)
Carl, I'm an archaeologist, not a
religious fanatic...

BUGENHAGEN
'Whereof ye have heard that he should
come, even now already is he in the
world, And his power shall be mighty;
and he shall destroy wonderfully, and
shall prosper, and practice, and shall
destroy the mighty and the holy,!

MORGAN

Morgan is suddenly attentive. He sips his brandy and

studies Bugenhagen,

BUGENHAGEN

You must take this to his new

parents, There's a letter inside

explaining everything.

MORGAN

I'm sorry, Carl, you can't expect

me --

BUGENHAGEN

They have to be warned! I'm too
old, too ili, I can't go myself,
And I'm the only person who knows

the truth, so I must --

He hesitates. Morgan adopts the over-gentle manner of one
speaking to an old friend who is balanced on the edge of a

breakdown.

MORGAN
Must what?

BUGENHAGEN
Stay where I'll be safe.

dig-hardened finger.

MORGAN
Same again.

And a double one for my old
friend, I think he could use
it.

EXT, BELVOIR CASTLE MOAT - DAWN 4

The rising sun gives the same livid red coloring to the ouins
and the vast Jordan Valley below them, Belvoir, the great
Crusader's castle, is situated at the top of a steep hill.
The dig is immense and complex and deserted. A distant buzz
prompts the CAMERA TO PAN SLOWLY AROUND and FIND a jeep
climbing up to the wide moat,

Bugenhagen, looking even more ashen, switches off the engine.
Morgan, wrapped in a warm blanket, is asleep in the back,

BUGENHAGEN
(shaking him)
Michael!

Morgan groans and opens one red eye,
MORGAN
I trust ali this will guarantee me
a place in the Kingdom of Heaven?

Bugenhagen grunts and hands him a miner's helmet and flash~-
light. He then picks up the leather box and they move off.

EXT, BELVOIR CASTLE - DAWN 5

Long-haired sheep nervously graze among the decaying walls
and arches. Their blank, colorless eyes start as the two
archaeologists appear. Their bells clang discordantly as
they run off in panic, stopping to stare as Bugenhagen and
Morgan approach the long dark staircase encased in the
castie's outer wall. They switch on their miner's lamps
and begin to descend the worn steps,

vast, dark. A line of six fifty-foot high pillars runs “he
length of the chamber, Bugenhagen enters, followed closely
by Morgan. They switch on their flashlights and cross to a
further excavation at the base of one pillar, Bugenhagen
moves painfully onto the ladder, »

MUSIC GROWS, THE FEELING OF DOOM IS OVERWHELMING,

Morgan has lagged behind. Bugenhagen turns to see where he
is. His miner's lamp finds a face that's uneasy in this
eerie place, Morgan follows reluctantly, Blackness closes
in as they descend and enter the tunnel below.

INT, BELVOIR CASTLE (ACRE) - TUNNEL 7

Lamps flash along the tunnel. On the floor, duckboards have
been laid. Obviously, this is where the most recent
excavations are being carried out. Equipment and discoveries,
all covered in plastic, line one side of the tunnel. Morgan's
lamp scans the objects as he moves along behind Bugenhagen.

He stops beside one particular piece and bends down to

examine it. It's a huge stone carving: A WOMAN SITTING UPON
A SCARLET-COVERED BEAST, THE BEAST IS COVERED WITH CARVED
NAMES AND HAS SEVEN HEADS AND TEN HORNS, He gently lifts

the plastic to get a better view of the unpleasant sculpture.

He locks up to see Bugenhagen disappearing through an exit
in the tunnel's side, The old man doesn't hear him, Morgan
carefully replaces the plastic.

BUGENHAGEN
forse
Come and see, Michael.

Morgan moves to the exit. He pauses there, watching
Bugenhagen in the low cavern beyond, ‘The old man's flasa-
light is moving over a wall painting partly hidden by the
base of a huge pillar.

BUGENHAGEN
This will convince youl!

MUSIC SWELLS. THE TOMB IS ABOUT TO BE CLOSED,

As Morgan moves in the direction of the wall, there's the
SOUND of a crack like a bullwhip, followed by a deep and
frightening rumble. He stops in his tracks. At that monent,
the tunnel roof gives way and crashes in an avalanche of
stone and dirt. Morgan looks back into the tunnel,

MORGAN
Is there another way out?

BUGENHAGEN
No.

They both reenter the tunnel end begin pulling away the
rubble,

Suddenly, there's another ear-splitting crack and rumble,
The roof behind them now caves in. Their tomb is no more
than five feet wide, The crash is followed by a deathly
silence, Morgan looks at Bugenhagen in horror. The old
man's eyes are closed, resigned, preparing for death, ‘Then
the silence is broken by the quietest but most sinister
sound -- running sand! A steady stream of 1t falls before
Morgan's face, He looks up. Holes appear in the roof.
Through each of them, sand begins to rapidly pour into the
cavity, They are trapped in an hourglass that's worth alll
of five minutes!

MORGAN
Carl -- |

He looks down. There, at his feet, is the WHORE OF BABYLON.
The sand is already covering it and the sculptured faces
mock him through the plastic, He begins to panic, claws
again at the rubble.

BUGENHAGEN
The Anti-Christ is with us! Give
yourself to God!

with a loud crack.

The sand is already at waist height. Morgan moans and
continues to claw at the debris. His efforts are futile.
Bugenhagen's eyes are closed.

BUGENHAGEN

unto the image of the BEAST; that
the image of the Beast should both
speak and cause that as many would
NOT worship the image of the Beast

Sand is at chin-level and rising. Bugenhagen continues
to pray.

BUGENHA GEN

overwhelm us and be triumphant,
but goodness will prevail. For it
is written in the Book of Revelation:
",..and then shall that WICKED be
revealed, whom the Lord shall consume
with the spirit of His mouth, and
shall destroy with the brightness
of His coming."!

The sand reaches their eyes. Morgan's muffled screams are
horrible. His eyes roll in their sockets. Bugenhagen
remains calm to the end. The sands of time run in, until
even the lamps of their miner's helmets are extinguishec.
BLACKNESS. TOTAL AND ABSOLUTE BLACKNESS.

EXT, THORN COUNTRY HOUSE - DUSK 13

Autumn, Vast bonfire of dead leaves is being tended by

several GARDENERS. A young boy, DAMIEN THORN, stands with
his back to us, contemplating the flames. Beyond him, way
in the distance, we see a palatial house, Many rooms are

: already lit against the impending darkness, A small figure,

MARK THORN, appears on a balcony with a bugle, and plays a
solitary note.

MARK

DAMIEN

Coming!

He turns to OLDER GARDENER. We see Damien is dressed in the
uniform of a military academy,

DAMIEN
See you next weekend,

JIM
Have a good time, Damien.

Damien is already running. CAMERA TRACKS WITH him, behind
the trees, towards the house.

INT. THORN COUNTRY HOUSE ~ DUSK 13-A

Through the window of the conservatory, we see Damien
approaching the house. He slows down as he enters and begins
to creep on tiptoe, He moves quietly behind the numerous
indoor plants and an Old Lady studying one of the rarer
species,

As he moves past her, Damien calls out loudly:

DAMIEN
Good-bye, Aunt Marion,

The Old Lady nearly jumps out of her elegant dress, CAMERA
TRAVELS ON WITH Damien into the huge hallway as Aunt Marion
calls after him:

AUNT MARION

INT. THORN COUNTRY HOUSE DINING ROOM ~ NIGHT 14

Four people are at the long, beautifully-set table: Richard
and Ann, the formidable AUNT MARION, Richard's aunt, and-
CHARLES WARREN, Curator of the Thorn Museum. A Servant Is
just leaving the room, having set down dessert, and as they
all bend to it:

AUNT MARION
Surely I'm entitled to an answer
to my question, Richard, even if
it's only out of deference to my
age...I

_ RICHARD
(with a look
at Warren)
I don't think we should bore
Charles with a personal --

AUNT MARION
There's nothing personal about
it. What do you say, Mr. Warren?
In a world filled with hate and
war, why send two young men to a
military academy, where they learn
nothing but marching and battle
maneuvers, and how to use deadly
weapons?

WARREN
(not eager to be
included)
I'm sure they're taught other
’ things...

AUNT MARION
Oh, yes, gymnastics and parading.
How many boys in uniform do you
see coming into your museum? Not
many, I think --

ANN
(firmly

become ruffians?

RICHARD
Robert and I went to Military School,
I don't think you can call us =~

AUNT MARION
I'm not saying you're a ruffian,
or that poor Robert was,..but there
are other effects that kind of
training --

ANN
(warningly)
Aunt Marion --

RICHARD
I suggest we table this discussion,
and have some coffee.

AUNT MARION
You're putting it politely, but
youtre still telling me to shut
up, and I won't be shut up! Look
what happened to your brother!
It all came out in the end, didn't
it? Madness and violence -~

Ann throws down her napkin --

Richard takes her by the arm, and begins gently but firmly
pulling her to her feet,

RICHARD

Excuse me,

Warren rises, flustered, but ever polite:

WARREN

At the door, Aunt Marion turns in Richard's grasp and faces
Ann:

AUNT MARION
You should take my side, you should
want to help your children, instead
of --

ANN
My children are my --

RICHARD
Enough, I said!

And he leads Aunt Marion out of the room. Ann, trembling,
sits, Warren taps nervous fingers on his coffee cup. When
she has pulled herself together somewhat:

ANN

she doesn't know what she's saying
anymore.,.I'm sorry.

The Whore of Babylon?
WARREN

WARREN
She represents Rome. The ten horns
of the beast are ten kings who have
no kingdoms yet, but who are going to
have temporary power granted by the
devil. His names are carved there,

EXT. DAVIDSON MILITARY ACADEMY - MORNING 22

Military Band bursts upon the SCREEN. Sticks bounce from
skins of the big bass drum and crack the sides of the tenors.
Horns rasp in the early morning air. The full Academy is
assembled on parade. Colonel and Staff face the MASSED
CADETS. Band stops abruptly. The last notes echo around
the buildings, followed by an uncanny ‘silence.

MARK
(sotto voce)
That must be hin.

The object of Mark and Damien's curiosity is a SERGEANT

Damien at attention in the front row. as Colonel and Neff
reach the Platoon --

COLONEL

At ease, boys. This is
Sergeant Daniel Neff. He's
taking over as Platoon Officer
from Sergeant Goodrich.
Sergeant Neff is a very experienced
soldier and I'm sure before many
weeks you'll be the smartest platoon
in the Academy.

I'll leave any further introductions
to you, Sergeant.

Neff salutes and watches the Colonel waddle off. In the
back row of the platoon stands a hulk of a boy -~- TEDDY,
He has his eyes on Neff's medals.

TEDDY
Sergeant, what are your medals...?

Neff barks at him.

NEFF
You'll speak to me only when
you're spoken to and you'll listen
to every word I say because I
intend to shine in my new job, and
the only way I can shine is by
making YOU shine. You're the little

INT. THORN INDUSTRIES HEADQUARTERS - DAY 22-8

Richard and BILL ATHERTON, the sixty-four-year-old President

towards the swing doors.

RICHARD
I'm the first to admit Paul's

it took us three years to find a
man with his qualifications...

ATHERTON
I'm not questioning qualifications,
it's --

ATHERTON

(shakes his head)
I can even cope with his manner,
I've met and dealt with every kind.
No. I don't like what he's proposing.
It sticks in my craw, and I don't
intend to hide my feelings.

Damien turns smartly and disappears inside the office. The

him.

TEDDY
Your cousin really thinks he's

My father says the Thorns make
their own hats because stores

He guffaws and the Cadets laugh, afraid of him. Mark steps
right up to him --

MARK

Do you collect stamps, Teddy?
TEDDY

No. .
MARK

You're going to start...Now!

With that, he stamps heavily on Teddy's foot. The bigger

Damien stares at Neff's BACK a moment. He feels strange,
a@ little light-headed. He doesn't know why. He turns,
goes out. When Neff hears the door close, still with his

Giant hurdle has been overcome.

Mark, the smaller of the two, is game but badly marked on
his face.

His voice comes out hard and cold and commanding, a tone
we haven't heard from him before. He stands erect, and
strangely strong. Teddy turns a grinning face to him.
Damien catches those momentarily triumphant eyes with
his own. The other Cadets fall silent. Teddy's smile is
fading fast. He is caught in some frightening grip. He
begins whimpering, unable to tear his eyes from Damien's.

TEDDY

No, Damien...

But Damien keeps on looking at him, his eyes blazing,

and soon there is a trickle of blood coming from Teddy's
nose, and his eyes are closing, as though he has been
bludgeoned, and he half-slumps against a wall, barely held
on his feet.

out of the car and leans across to the backseat for her
coat. There's an abrupt fluttering sound followed by strange
seratching on metal. She jumps back. There, by her face,
a crow settles its enormous wings and eyes her from the

ear roof. Joan gasps and moves instinctively away. The
crow's nasty little eyes never leave her. She waves her
coat ineffectually to frighten it away but the bird doesn't
move, Joan kicks the car door shut and moves off, watching
the crow as she pulls on her coat. Even with the gap widen-
ing between her and the car, she looks nervously back, The
crow just sits there, Twenty yards, Thirty. Forty. She
takes a final look -- the crow has gone. Disquieted, she
looks all around, The bird has disappeared, and with it go
her anxieties. She settles down to cover the three miles
without again looking back, CAMERA FOLLOWS her. ‘There's
an awful screech and the crow descends from behind, It
crash-lands on her head and WE SEE it lean forward, yellow
beak open. Joan lets out a piercing scream and flails at
the bird with her arms, But the claws embedded in her hair
won't be dislodged and the crow continues to pivot and peck
at her face. Its beak is now saturated in blood. When

the poor, demented woman finally turns, WE SEE her eyes

are gone from the bloody sockets. ‘The crow's wings open
wide and, like an avenged angel, it lifts off into the sky.
CAMERA RISES ABOVE the blinded woman reeling about the
tarmac and finally slipping down the shoulder into a field.
Her screams and sobs float up unheeded. A new and distant
sound begins to intrude. The high-floating CAMERA SWINGS
To INCLUDE more of the highway. WE SEE a massive articulated
lorry speeding along, too fast.

NEW ANGLE ON JOAN 50

Her blood-spattered hands claw at her face as if trying to
replace her eyes. Suddenly, she stops sobbing and hears
the approaching lorry. She gets to her feet and tries
vainly to find the highway, holding out her arms as if
playing "Blindman's Buff." CAMERA ABOVE COLDLY WATCHES

as she bumps into a tree beside the highway. She struggles
up the embankment, clawing and calling out. She rushes out
from behind the tree as the lorry bears down. ‘There is
nothing the Driver can do. He tries to brake. Screaming
tires and a sickening thud heralds the demise of Joan Hart.
Her body bounds into the air and lies still when it lands
on the roof of the slithering truck. The silence would de
absolute but for the idling of the lorry's engines and the
caw of the crow, The big bird circles, then flies casually
away.

Mark's side; Richard on Damien's, doing his best, but meinly
following his son's lead, and delighting in Damien's power
and style. Buher is on Damien's side as well. Damien is the
