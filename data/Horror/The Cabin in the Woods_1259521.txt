INT. BREAKROOM - MORNING

Steve HADLEY and Richard SITTERSON are workaday white
collar joes getting coffee and vending snacks as they
chat. Hadley is blandly handsome, sitterson bordering on
nerdy, but they have a sweet rapport.

HADLEY
It’s hormonal. I Mean, I don’t usually
fall back on, you know, “it’s women’s
issues”...

SITTERSON
But child-proofed how? Gates and stuff?

HADLEY
No no, dude -- she bought gates, they’re
stacked up in the hall -- she did the
drawers! We're not even sure this
fertility thing is gonna work and she’s
screwed in these little jobbies where you
can’t open the drawers.

SITTERSON
At all?

HADLEY
They oper, like, an ingh, then you gotta
dig your fingers in and _- it’s a

nightmare!
SITTERSON

Well, I guess sooner or later --
HADLEY

Later! She did the upper cabinets -- kid
won't be able to reach those ‘til he’s
thirty! Assuming, you know: kid.

Hoisting files and, in Sitterson’s case, a small white
cooler -- the kind that might carry organs -- they exit
into:

INT. HALL - CONTINUOUS

It’s an anonymous concrete maze. A few other workers
pass by as the men talk.

SITTERSON
It’s a talisman. It’a an offering.

HADLEY
Don’t even -- you have women’s issues.

WA
 

 

Wendy LIN, a nervous woman in a labcoat,

Hadley points at him,

SITTERSON
Please. You of all People --

HADLEY
Me of no people! It’s a jinx.
Guarantees we won’t get pregnant and it

takes me twenty minutes to get a fucking
beer.

joins them.

LIN
Stockholm went south.

SITTERSON

Seriously? 1 thought they were looking

good.

LEY
What cracked?

LIN

I haven’t seen the footage; word's just
going around.

HADLEY
That scenario’s never been stable. you

can't trust... what do You call people
from Stockholm?

SITTERSON
Stockholders?

‘oh no you didn’t: making a big

HADLEY
Haaah!

LIN
That means there's just Japan. Japan and
us.

HADLEY
Not the first time it’s come down to
that.

SITTERSON

Japan hae a Perfect record.

HADLEY
And we’re number two 80 we try harder.

LIN
It's cutting it close.
They turn a corner and find a row of golf carts at the
end of a long, featureless hall. The boys hop in.

HADLEY
That’s why it’s in the hands of
Professionala,

SITTERSON
They hired Professionals? what happens
to us?

LIN
You guys better not be messing around in
there.

SITTERSON
Does this mean you're not in the betting
Pool this year? Big money...

LIN
I’m just saying it’s a key scenario.

 

HADLEY
I_ know what you're Baying. ‘98 was the i)
chem department's fault. And where do

you werk again? Wait, it’s coming back

to me...

 

He peels out, Sitterson trying not to spill his coffee.
We stay with them...

HADLEY (CONT’D)
Gonna be a long weekend if everybody's
that puckered up. Hey, you want to come
over Monday night? I’m gonna pick up a
couple power drills and liberate my
cabinets --

Very suddenly there dea horribly loud musical sting and
a smash cut to titles:

THE CABIN IN THE woops

EXT. COLLEGE Town — DAY

The horrible sound gives way to jaunty rock. We see a
street with a good, boho student vibe, not
unSanFranciscolike. Arm in on a nice three story
townhouse and into the second story window of:

   
 

INT. DANA’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

DANA POLK, a thoughtful, attractive college sophomore.
Her room is like her: restrained and well ordered, but
with funky touches of color and whimay. A few sketches
and watercolors of her own dot the walls as well.

Dana is in shirt and undies, packing for a trip and
bopping softly to the music, which now comes from her
little stereo. She does that singing-along thing where
you start to sing too soon, looks sheepish even though
she’s alone.

She takes a couple of political science textbooks, drops
them in her suitcase, Crosses to grab some art supplies,
including a battered sketchbook. She pauses, flipping
through her sketches —— which aren’t bad —— til she gets
to a portrait of a handsome thirtysomething man with
longish hair and glasses.

CLOSE ON Dana staring sadly at the picture when Julie
“JULES” Louden comes into frame next to her. Jules is
bubbly, sexy and as of ten minutes ago, blonde.

JULES
What a piece of shit.

DANA
(not looking up)
Twas ina hurry.

JULE:
You know what I mean. Why haven’t you
stuck that asshole’s picture on the dart
board yet?

DANA
It’s not that simp -- oh my God your
hair!

JULES
Very fabulous 7, No?

DANA
I can’t believe you did it!

JULES
But very fabulous, right -- hurry up with
the very fabulous, I’m getting insecure
about it now.
 

 

She holds

DANA
Oh God, no, it’s awesome! It looks
really Natural, and it’s great with your
skin. I just didn’t think you were
gonna --~

JULES
Impulse. I woke up this morning and
thought “I want to have more fun. Who is
it that has more fun?”

DANA
Curt’s gonna lose it.

JULES
He'll have more fun too. And go will
you --
(plucks the Pad from Dana)
-- while we are burning this picture.

DANA
(grabbing back)
I’m not ready to —- seriously, this isn’t
his fault. ( 3

JULES
What’s not his fault? Being thirty eight
and married, fucking his student or
breaking up with her by e-mail?

DANA
I knew what I was getting into.

JULES
Right: Dana Polk, Homewrecker. Please,
You know what you're getting into this
weekend?

up Dana’s bikini from her open drawer,

JULES (CONT ’D)
This. And if Holden’s as cute as Curt
says he is, possibly getting out of it.

DANA
That’s the last thing -- if you guys
treat this like a set-up I’m gonna have
no fun at all.

JULES
(crossing to the suitcase)
I’m not pushing. But we're Packing this, (
Which means we definitely won't have room ”
for --
 

 

She pulls the text books out.

DANA
Oh come on, what if I’m bored?

JULES
These’1l help? “Soviet Economic
Structures”? “Aftermath of the
Cultural...” No! We have a lake! Anda
keg! We are girls on the verge of going
wild -- Look at my hair, woman!

DANA
It is great...

CURT
Think fast!

CURT Vaughan is Jules’s boyfriend and yes, that’s a
letterman jacket he’s wearing and yes, that’s a football
he’s throwing right at the girls.

REVERSE on them yeeping and flinching as the ball goes
right between them and out the window.

CURT (CONT’D)
Well, faster than that...

JULES
Curt!

Dana moves to look out the window, is in time to see:

ANGLE: DOWN ON THE STREET

Curt’s friend HOLDEN McCrea rushes into the street and
catches the ball, a slowing car bumping his leg. It’s an
impressive catch.

HOLDEN
Yes!
(to the driver)
Sorry. Sorry. Move along.

ANGLE ON: the two girls at the window, Curt behind Jules,
all looking out.

CURT
Niiice!

DANA
Is that Holden?
aa

 

 

 

CURT
(calling)
Come on up!
(to the girls)
Transferred from State.

Best hands on
the team. He's a sweet

guy.

JULES
(to Dana, archly)
And he’s good with his hands...

CURT
That's nothing. Watch this:

He grabs Jules’s boobs from behind.

CURT (CONT'D)
Oh my god! Both at once!

I’m like some
kind of Olympian God!

JULES
(wriggling free)
Olympian wad...

CURT : 3
(to Dana, shyly)

I'm sort of seeing this girl, but, uh,
you're way blonder than she is, and I was
thinking we could... what is this?

He pries the books from Jules.

CURT(CONT’D)
What are these? What are you doing with
these?

DANA
Okay, I get it, Il] —-

CURT
(to Jules, ignoring Dana)
Where did you get these? who taught you
about these?

JULES
(ala PSA:)
I learned it from you, okay?

In mock weep, she flees the room. Curt holds the first
book up to Dana.

CURT

Seriously? Professor Ben:

(
nett covers this :
whole book i

n his lectures,
(MORE )

"eae
Oy

 

CURT (CONT'D)
Read the Gurovsky; it’s way more
interesting and Bennett doesn’t know it
by heart so he'll think you're
insightful. and you have no pants.

He tosses the books back on the bed, calling out to:

CURT (CONT'D)
Holden! Crazy mad skills of catching!

Dana, panicked, hoists her jeans on, heading out after
Curt into:

INT. LIVING Room — CONTINUOUS

Jules is opening the door for Holden, and he’s even
better looking up close. Less of a wild man than curt.

HOLDEN
You laid it in my hands, I diq but hold
them out.

He tosses it back to Curt and grabs his weekend duffle
bay, entering.

Hey, I’m Jules,

HOLDEN
Hi. Man, Curt did not exaggerate.

JULES
(pleased)
That's a first...

CURT
Dude, this is Dana.

DANA
Hey.

HOLDEN
(shakes her hand)

thank you guys for letting me crash your
weekend. I'1] just put a disclaimer up
front: you don’t have to explain any of
your in-jokes. 1°21) Probably be drunk
and think they're funny anyway. Should r
have left out the Part about being drunk?

CURT
With hindsight, yeah.
 

 

 

HOLDEN
Damn. Can I help anybody carry anything?

EXT. STREET OUTSIDE - A BIT LATER

Holden is dumping Jules’s last suitcase (she has
overpacked) into the RAMBLER, the trailer Curt owns, with
the dirt-bike attached to the rear. Dana’s inside, takes
it from him (polite smile between them) as he turns back
to Jules and a bag-laden Curt.

HOLDEN
That pretty much it?

CURT
Fuckin’ better be! Jules, it’s a
weekend, not an evacuation.

JULES
Trust me when I say there is nothing in
those cases you won’t be glad I brought.

CURT ( JS
I’m shuttin’ right up, -

DANA
(looking eff)
Oh my gad...

ANGLE: A CAR has just finished parking. Martin “MARTY”
Mikalski is getting out of the driver's seat while
smoking a huge bong. It’s difficult to maneuver, but
definitely not his first time.

His friends instantly look around for, oh, say, police...

JULES
Marty...

CURT
Fuck is wrong with you, bro?

MARTY
People in this town drive in a very
counterintuitive manner, and that’s what
I have to say.

CURT
Do you want to spend the weekend in jail?
‘cause we'd all like to check out my
cousin’s country home and not get boned ( 5
in the ass by a huge skinhead. 3
 

10.

JULES
Marty, honey, that’s not okay.

MARTY
Statistical fact: cops will never pull
over a man with a huge bong in his car.
Why? They fear this man. They know he
sees farther than they and he will bind
them with ancient logics.
(staring at Jules’s hair)
Have you gone grey?

CURT
You're not bringing that thing in the
rambler,

MARTY

A giant bong, in your father’s van?

He pours the water out. Removes the bowl, sticks it ina
little holder inside the tube and telescopes the entire
thing down, pulls a lid off the bottom and Pops it on the
top, making it look exactly like a can of Fresca,

MARTY (CONT'D)
What are you, stoned?

As Holden raises his eyebrows and Jules rolls hex eyes
Marty hops in, calling out:

MARTY (CONT ’D)
(from inside van)
Dana! You fetching minx! Do you have
any food?

INT./EXT. VAN - A BIT LATER

The key is turned, the gas stepped on. Curt looks in the
rear view at his peeps.

CURT
Everybody ready?

General assent.

CURT (CONT’D)
Then let’s get this show on the road!

ANGLE: FROM UP HIGH we see the rambler rolling off into
the distance. The camera arms up to watch it go, the
side of the building in frame.
 

 

‘2
ll. :

It reaches the roof and Pans over as we find a group of
six men in Clean Room Suite standing silently. After a
beat, one speaks into his earpiece.

CLEAN MAN
Nest is empty, we are right on time.

A beat, then he circles his finger in the air, scrambling
the men to pick up cases and head for the door to the
stairwell.

CLEAN MAN(CONT’D)
Go for clean-up. Go, go, go.

INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY

A thick metal door (not vault-sized, but impressive)
wheezes open, a military guard standing behind it. His
name is Alex TRUMAN, and his exact military affiliation
is unclear. He is upright, exacting, and Pretty new at
all this.

TRUMAN (
Identification, Please. 7

REVERSE on Sitterson and Hadley as they pull off their
badges and swipe them over Truman's handheld reader. He
confirms:

TRUMAN (CONT’D)
Mister Sitterson, Mister Hadley, thank
you. Please come in,

and Hadley to move about in. On the far wall, over the
lower space, are three big screens, also off. The Place
resembles a movie mixing stage, or a tiny Houston

Control.
Hadley and Sitterson make their way up, talking with
Truman.
HADLEY
What’s your name?
TRUMAN

Alex Truman, sir.

 
12.

HADLEY
Well, this isn’t the army, Truman, 80 you
can drop the “sir”. But Sitterson does
like to be called “ma’am".

 

SITTERSON
(sliding the cooler under a
counter)
Or “Honey Toes”.

HADLEY
He will also answer to “Honey Toes”. Are
you clear on what's gonna be happening

here?
TRUMAN

I’ve been prepped extensively.
HADLEY

And did they tell you that being prepped
is not the same as being prepared?

TRUMAN

They told me. I°11 hold my post, Mister

Hadley. I/’11 see it through.
Q, HADLEY

2 Not mich else you gotta do. Stand watch,

check I.D.’s, shouldn't be a lot more
than that. And you have to get us
coffee,

TRUMAN
They also told me you would try and make
me get you coffee.

HADLEY
Balls.
(quieter, indicating
Sitterson)
Can you make him get us coffee? With
your gun?
TRUMAN
And that you would try to make me do
that.
SITTERSON

(from off camera)
It wasn’t funny last time, either!

Hadley is shrugging, hitting a bank of switches on the
wall that audibly powers up the control room. He crosses
( » to his chair and starts flipping switches there as well.
aa TE

ae?

 

13.

Sitterson is already entering data into a computer,
locking and testing knobs and levers,

Sitterson rolls to another bank of controls, flips the
cover off a row of buttons.

SITTERSON(CONT’D)
Let’s light this candle, boys, Up is go
on your command.

The screens all come to white, blank life, their light
brightening the dim room.

EXT. RAMBLER - DAY

It trucks along an old road, nothing but brush visible.

INT. RAMBLER — CONTINUOUS

The gang is in mid-ride, clearly a couple hours in. curt
is still driving. Jules, riding shotgun, is checking
both a map and the GPs. Marty sits at the little table,
cautiously relling an elegant, filtered row of joints.
Dana sits with him, Holden in the bathroom with the doo
open, where we can see they’ve stashed a keg. He's
filling three cups.

JULES
I hope this is the right road, ‘cause
right now it looks like the only road.

CURT
What about that thing we crossed back
there?

JULES
Doesn’t even show on the GPS. It’s
unworthy of global positioning.

DANA
It must feel horrible...

MARTY
That’s the whole point. Get off the
grid. No cellphone reception, no
markers, no traffic cameras... go
somewhere for one goddamn weekend where
they can’t globally position my ass.
This is the whole issue,

‘2

C

Nouns!
O

or

14.

JULES
(heard this before)
Is society crumbling, Marty?

MARTY
Society is binding. It’s filling in the
cracks with concrete. No cracks to slip
through. Everything is recorded, filed,
blogged, chips in our kids ao they don’t
get lost -- society needs to crumble.
We're all too chickenshit to let it.

JULES
I’ve missed your rants.

He grins at her, holds up a gorgeous joint.

MARTY
You will come to see things my way.

JULES
I can’t wait. Is that the secret stash?

MARTY
The secret secret stash. I haven't told
my other stash about it because it would
become jealous.

DANA
(pointing ahead)
A sign. Up there.

JULES
(turns back)
Yes. And... okay, left. Bear left.

CURT
You sure?

JULES
Not even a little bit.

Holden brings up beers for Curt, Jules and Dana, who
amiles at him shyly.

HOLDEN
What is this place exactly?

CURT
Country home my cousin bought. He’s
crazy for real estate, found this Place
in the middle of nowhere, it’s like civil
war era, seriously.
JULES

There's a lake, and woods everywhere...

15.

‘2

we saw some beautiful Pictures.

(to Dana)
You will be doing some serious drawing.
No portraits of pedophiles...

Dana gives her a ‘shut up’ look,

HOLDEN
(settling by Dana)
You’re an art major?

DANA
Art and political science.

HOLDEN
Ooh, triple threat.

DANA
(after a small beat)
That‘’s only two things.

HOLDEN
Yes, a double... threat that sounds weird
~~ let's just say I fing you threatening.

 

CURT
I thought you were dropping art.

JULES
Uh, no, never mind...

Jules swats Curt, gives him a look.

DANA
I’m switching a few courses.

HOLDEN
How come?

CURT
For no reason! For very good reasons
that don’t exist. Hey look, trees!

MARTY
We have patterns. Societially. The
beautimous Dana fell into one of the
oldest patterns and we are here to burn
it away and pour ash into the grooves it
has etched in her brain. Cover the
tracks and set her feet on new ground.

  
eee

() 16.

HOLDEN
(to Dana)

Is it okay if I didn’t follow that?
DANA

I’d take it as a favor.
CURT

Gas!

They all look ahead.

CURT(CONT’D)

Gas. And maybe someone who knows where
we actually are.

EXT/INT. GAS STATION

It is as decrepit and abandoned looking as it can be. An
old pump squats in front of a monument to rust, windows
clouded with grime. 9

ANGLE: FROM INSIDE through the windows we see the
vembler pull up. The inside of this place doesn’t look

( any more inviting than the outside. Once upon a time
% things were fixed and goods were sold in here, but not of
' 3 late.

The kids pile out, stretching, looking about. curt and
Marty examine the pump.

CURT

I’m thinking this thing doesn’t take
credit cards.

MARTY
I don’t think it knows about money. I
think it’s barter gas.
Curt moves a pace to see if anyone is around.

ANGLE: HOLDEN is inside, moving slowly toward the back.
We hear Curt’s offscreen:

CURT
Hello?

But no reply. Holden keeps walking, tracing his finger
along the countertop.

CLOSE ON: HIS FINGER trailing a line of clear glass into
the grime.

 
 

 

S

17.

ANGLE: THE GIRLS
Are making their way nimbly around back.

JULES
Because I hate going in the Rambler!

DANA
You think the toilet here’s gonna be
better?

JULES
I don’t like to pee when all my friends
are two feet away from me. I’m quirky.
At least this has gotta be HOAH!

They stop, staring in horror.

REVERSE ON: THE BATHROOM. It’s just as horrible as it
could be. The door off, the room tiny -- the walls
stained with what might be actual slime. The toilet is
lidless, broken and filled with brownish sludge.

A weird little gurgle comes from it. ( 2

Dana moves forward, brow furrowed. She leans in and
looks down.

In the toilet, a Scorpion struggles, drowning in the
fetid muck.

ANGLE: HOLDEN is heading back outside. We're behind him,
and through the Open doorway we can see Curt and Marty
trying to figure out how to work the pump.

HOLDEN
I don’t think there's gonna be any --

The ATTENDANT fills the doorway, having come around from
the outside. He speaks as he appears, over the surge of
music and Holden’s shocked jump --

ATTENDANT
You come in here uninvited?

HOLDEN
(over this)
Fuck!

The attendant is old, weathered, and creepy as hell. one
eyeball is hideously red, tobacco chaw spills over his

stained lips, and he carries a permanent scowl of ( 2
disgust. : _
 

 

18.

HOLDEN (CONT'D)
Dude....

ATTENDANT
Sign says closed.

Curt is making his way over to him, Marty judiciously
hanging back.

CURT
We were looking to buy some gas? Does
this pump work?

ATTENDANT
Works if you know how to work it...

But he doesn’t move to help. The girls come around, no
more anxious to get close once they’ve seen him than
Marty was.

HOLDEN
We also wanted to get directions...
CURT
Yeah, we're looking for...
(to Jules)
++-what is it?
JULES

(coming forward)
Tillerman Road? Do you know if it’s this
way?

The attendant looks at her, the name registering. She
kind of wriggles under his gaze.

ATTENDANT
(mutters)
What a waste.

He starts ambling toward the pump, pulling out a ring of
keys and unlocking a latch.

ATTENDANT (CONT'D)
Tillerman Road takes you up into the
hills. Dead ends at the old Buckner

Place,
CURT
(to Jules)
Is that the name of --
JULES

There wasn’t a name...
 

)

(
»

The attendant sticks the nozzle in the rambler’s gas
tank. The numbers on the pump start going up manually
(like they used to back when), but creak to a stop almost
immediately.

CURT
(to the attendant)
My cousin bought a house up there, you go
through a mountain tunnel, there's a
lake, would that be...

ATTENDANT
Buckner place. Always someone looking to
sell that plot.
(bad, bad smile)
Always some fool looking to buy.

JULES
You knew the original owners?

ATTENDANT
Not the first. But I’ve seen plenty come
and go. Been here since the war.

ous ‘3

ATTENDANT
(flaring up)
You know damn well which warl

Which war?

She takes a step back, freaked. Dana takes her arm.

MARTY
Would that have been with the blue, and
some in grey? Brother, perhaps fighting
against brother in that war?

ATTENDANT
You sassin’ me, boy?

MARTY
You were rude to my friend.

The attendant stops for a second, not expecting this guy
to have come back at him. Glances at Jules, mutters:

ATTENDANT
That whore?

Curt is about to clock him but Holden puts a hand to
Curt’s chest, steps forward. (
 

(>

20.

HOLDEN
I think we've got enough gas.

ATTENDANT
Enough to get you there. Gettin’ back’s
your own concern.

He pulls out the nozzle as the gang moves back in, Curt
contemptuously throwing a twenty at the guy’s feet.

MARTY
Good luck with your business. I know the
railroad’s comin’ through here any day
now, gonna be big. Streets paved with...
actual street.
(to himself)
Fucker.

ANGLE: THE RAMBLER'S TIRE

Spins in the sand and takes the heap right out of there, |
cruising down the road.

The attendant watches, spits chaw. Watches.

EXT. WOODS - DAY

A helicopter shot floats over the rambler as it winds
through an endlans expanse of firs, finally consumed by
them.

EXT. MOUNTAIN TUNNEL - AFTERNOON

The Rambler comes up the side of a steep drop-off. We
see Jules in the Passenger seat smiling...

JULES
Guys, take a look...

And we pan with the vehicle as it enters the mountain
tunnel, slowing down a bit -- it’s a tight fit. The
camera moves up the mountainside, looking down to see the
rambler come out the other end.

A bird comes from behind camera, flying directly above
the tunnel. About halfway across it hits an invisible
vom

EXT. CABIN/INT.VAN - AFTERNOON

There’s no audio but music as the kids all crowd the
front of the van to look at their vacation spot. The
lake appears up ahead, sun rippling over the water, and
they look and point, talking a bit.

Finally the camera races through the forest and finds the
cabin. It squats uninvitingly, a fairly ramshackle --
though not overly rustic —- single story structure.
Windows on either side of the door, not unlike closed
eyes.

The van pulls up and the kids come out, more slowly than
they did at the gas station, taking it in. Dana's a
little entranced, Holden curious, Curt pumped, Jules
mildly excited, Marty wary.

JULES
Oh my god, it’s beautiful!
(to Curt, sotto voce)
One spider and I’m sleeping in the
Rambler. I mean it. Uno spider-o. ,
vanry J
(to himself)
This house is talking a blue streak...

As the boys start unloading the keg, Dana approaches the
front door... alewly turns the knob.. .

INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

She enters the living room. It’s also, if you turn to
the right, the kitchen; the stove is a classic old wood—
burning Kalamazoo Wonder, the sink clearly retro-fitted.
The decor is sparse and antlery. A wolf’s head is
mounted on one wall.

A hall goes own the middle, with two bedrooms on either
side. Dana makes her way around the room as the rest of
the gang pours in.

CURT
Oh, this is awesome!

JULES
It is kinda cool. You gonna kill us a
raccoon to eat?

CURT (
(nodding) \
I will use its skin to make a cap.

Sow
 

 

22.

Jules runs down to thé hall, to look in the rooms,
grabbing a doorknob --

JULES
Dibs on whichever room is -- ow!

She pulls her finger back -- it’s cut, slightly on the
tip, a little blood welling up.

JULES (CONT’D)
Curt, your cousin’s house attacked me.

CURT
I smell lawsuit...

HOLDEN
When was your last tetanus shot?

JULES
Thanks, that’s very comforting.

CURT
Jules is pre-med. she knows there’s no
coming back from thia.
(stroking her hair)
T’ll miss you, baby. I’11] miss your
shiny new hair.

Dana looks over at Marty, who stands in the doorway,
looking around warily.

DANA
Marty? Are you Planning on coming in?

He looks around, not ready to make his move.

INT. HOLDEN’S ROOM — AFTERNOON

Holden throws his bag on his bed, which squeaks
appallingly. He looks around the decrepit -- but not
entirely un-homey -- room, focusses on a picture opposite
the bed.

ANGLE: THE PICTURE is like 19th century print, but it’s
of a hunting Party with machetes and dogs tearing a lamb
to pieces and, upon close examination, is repulsive,

HOLDEN
Yeah, I don’t think go.
Se es

 

 

23.

He takes the picture off the wall, camera follows him as
he leans it on the floor, comes back up to find Dana
staring at him blankly through a hole in the wall. once
again, he jumps.

HOLDEN (CONT'D)
Wow. I’ve heard about the walls being
thin, but --

She bares her teeth at him. He stops, not getting what's
going on at all, then as she starts picking between them,
he gets it. Moves forward and puts his hand to the one-
way mirror between then.

HOLDEN (CONT’D)
No way...

He watches her for a bit, first amused, then a little
hypnotised. She really is kind of beautiful. She musses
her hair a little, gives up, grinning at her own vanity.
Moves to her bed and starts unbuttoning her shirt,
HOLDEN (CONT’D)
Oh shit, ah no, ahh... ( 2

He bobs back and forth between this golden opportunity
and cegmnen human (yawn) decency. Moves away from the
hole, out of frame, Moves back,

Finally bangs on the wall, ducking his head just as she’s
about to take it off —-

HOLDEN (CONT'D)
(calls through)
Hold up!

INT. HOLDEN’S ROOM/HALL/DANA’S ROOM — MOMENTS LATER

The gang is all in there, checking it out.

JULES
You have got to be kidding me.

DANA
That’s just creepy.

MARTY
It was pioneer days; people had to make
their own interrogation rooms. Out of
cornmeal,

Raye
 

Od,

24.

HOLDEN
(touches the edge)
This from the... seventies, judging by
the weathering. Who did your cousin buy
this place from?

CURT
We should check the rest of the rooms.
Make sure this is the only one.
(to Jules)
You know Marty wants to watch us pounding
away.

MARTY
(wincing)
I didn’t even like hearing that.

JULES
(as they exit)
Don’t be an ape, Curt.

He makes ape noises off screen. Dana is still staring at

HOLDEN
How about we switch?
(she turns to him)
Not that I'd... I mean I'l) put the
picture back but you might feel better if
we switched rooms.

DANA
I really would.

He grabs his bag and they head out as she says:

DANA (CONT’D)
Thanks for... being decent.

HOLDEN
Least I could do, since Curt and Jules
have sold you to me for marriage.

She makes cringe face.

DANA
They're not subtle.

HOLDEN
I’m just here to relax. And so can you.

DANA
Yeah, I’m not looking for... But I’m
still grateful that you’re not a creep,
ey

 

25.

HOLDEN
Hey, let’s not jump to any conclusions
there. I had kind of an internal debate
about showing you the mirror. Shouting
on both sides, blood was spilled...

In her (now his) room, he dumps his stuff and she grabs
hers.

DANA

So you're bleeding internally.
HOLDEN

Pretty bad.
DANA

Well, Jules is the doctor-in-training.
You should probably talk to her.

HOLDEN
Yeah.

Dana exits, clearly frustrated with her lame exit line.
She enters her new room and, dropping her luggage, moves
to put the picture back. she’s stopped hy the aight of

iden, also looking a little fruatrated. A moment, and
he pulls his shirt over his head. He’s in pretty good
shape. He pulls his bathing suit out of his bag, starts
unbuttoning his pants --

DANA
Uhhh... ah! God!

Sheepishly, she grabs the picture and replaces it. Takes
a@ moment to look at the slaughtered lamb scene. oe

DANA (CONT’D)
Yeah, I don’t think go.

We cut to a high and wide of her placing a little blanket
over the picture, and suddenly the frame is that ofa
monitor, as we pull back to see:

INT. CONTROL ROOM
++-we're watching Dana on a MONITOR. And as we continue
to PULL OUT, we see MORE MONITORS. ON THE SCREENS: we

see a surveillance view of Holden in his room...

s+eand Marty in his room... and Jules with curt... In
fact --

QO

CD
O,

ALL THE MONITORS on the control bank are now lit up, each
showing different views of the cabin and surrounding
area. Sitterson rolls into frame on his office chair,
looking the screens over --

SITTERSON
All right -- places everyone -- we are
live --

Hadley stares at DANA’S MONITOR. Keys the microphone in
front of him --

HADLEY
Engineering, we've got a room change.
Polk is now in Two, McCrea’s in Four.
Story department -- you copy? We'll
need a scenario adjustment...

VOICE
(over speaker)
Have it back to you in fifteen...

Sitterson glances up as --

SITTERSON
Ms, Lin!

~~ Wendy Lin entere the area, clipboard under her am.
Sitterson wheels himself towards her.

LIN
We've got bloodwork back on Louden.

ANGLE: ON A MONITOR is JULES, going through her stuff.

LIN(CONT’D)
Her levels are good -- but we're
recommending a fifty milligram increase
of Rhohyptase to increase libido.

SITTERSON

Sold.

LIN
Do we pipe it in or do you wanna do it
orally?

SITTERSON

Ask me that again only slower.

LIN
Works into the blood through the scalp,
very gradual.

The Chem Department keeps their end up.

HADLEY

I’ll see it when I believe it.
And ANOTHER VOICE rings out over the speakers --

SECOND VOICE

Control? ( 2

HADLEY
Go ahead.

 

SECOND VOICE
I have the Harbinger on line two...

Hadley and Sitterson share a glance. Sitterson holds up
his hands -- don’t look at me. This is all yours...

HADLEY
Christ. Can you take a message?

SECOND VOICE
Uh... I don’t think so. He's really
pushy.
(beat)
To be honest, he's kinda freaking me out.

HADLEY
(looks to the other two.. +)
Yeaaaahh. Okay, put him through ~-

Hadley hits a button on hia keyboard --

YET ANOTHER VOICE
The lambs have Passed through the gate...

EXT. GAS STATION

The ATTENDANT (who, it turns out, is named MORDECAI)
speaks into the gas station Payphone --

OLD MAN

INT. CONTROL ROOM
Hadley nods, moves to hang up --

HADLEY
Yeah, you did great out there, By the
numbers; started us off right. we'll
talk to you later, oka--

ATTENDANT (0.8.)
Their blind eyes see nothing of the
horrers to come. Their ears are stopped;
they are God's fools.

HADLEY

Well, that’s how it works.

ATTENDANT (0.S.)
Cleanse them. Cleanse the world of their
ignorance and sin. Bathe them in the

Am I on speakerphone?

HADLEY
No, no of course not,

ATTENDANT (0.S.)
Yes Iam. I can hear the echo. Take me
off. Now.

Sitterson starts laughing. He clamps his hands down over
his mouth to keep quiet. Lin keeps mostly cool...

HADLEY
Okay, sorry.

ATTENDANT (O.S.)
I'm not kidding. It's rude. I don’t
know who's in the room.
 

HADLEY

Fine. There -- you’re off speakerphone.

Thank you.

OLD MAN (0.S.)

Sitterson’s nearly erying now --

OLD MAN (CONT'D)

HADLEY
No. You’re not. I promise.

(furious):

Who is that? Who's laughing?

Sitterson pounds hia head on the console, he’s laughing

so hard. Off which --

JULES
(to Dana and Holden)
Does it seem fresh? Lotta funky diseases
sitting in stagnant lake water.

DANA
What? This water?
(takes a gulp of the lake
water)
This water's delicious.

HOLDEN
Oh my god, she’s right --
(cups it into his mouth)
It tastes like... vitamins. And hope.

DANA
C'mon Jules -- life is risk.

JULES
Yeah, I might just risk lying out in the
sun for a while.

Curt steps to the edge of the dock,. face falling as he

 

y looks into the water --
CURT
What ia that?
DANA
What?
CURT
In the lake. I swear to god I...
DANA
Yeah, right...
CURT
(scared)

No, seriously. Right there. Don’t you
see it? There. It looks just like --

He puts his hand on Jules back --

CURT (CONT'D)
My girlfriend.

And with that, he shoves Jules straight into the lake.
Splash!

JULES
(as she surfaces)
Oh! Oh my god! I’m gonna kill you!

Curt points at another part of the lake --
CURT
Look -- there's something else in the
lake --

He jumps out right where he was pointing -- SPLASH -- ag
he surfaces --

CURT (CONT'D)
It’s a gorgeous man!

JULES

(swimming over to him)
You are so dead --
He laughs as she tries to dunk him --

CURT
Don’t kill the gorgeous man! They’re
endangered!

Dana laughs, looks up at Marty --

e

DANA
Marty -- get in here —-
MARTY
Nah, man. I’mcool. Just seeing the

sighta...

He sits down on the edge of the dock, dangles his feet in
the water. Leana back. High as the proverbial kite --

MARTY (CONT’D)
Just seeing the sights.

And with that, we CUT WIDE ON THE LAKE. On the horizon,
the sun is just staring to set. We HOLD ON THIS TABLEAU
as the kids splash and laugh and frolic in the lake.

For a moment, all is right with the world.

INT. CONTROL ROOM

WHUMP! A large wad of CASH slams down onto the console.
Widen to reveal Sitterson -- for some reason he’s holding
large wads of cash. As he steps up onto the console -~

SITTERSON
Last chance to post! C’mon people, dig (3
deep. Betting windows are about to a

close!

O,

32.

The room is bustling with activity. Several People are
clustered around Hadley, thrusting papers and cash in his
face, everybody talking over each other --

HADLEY
(to Sitterson)
Who’s still out?

Sitterson looks at his clipboard --

SITTERSON
I got Engineering, I got R&D, I got
Electrical --

HADLEY
Did you see who they picked? They’re
Practically giving their money away.

SITTERSON
Yeah, you’re one to talk, Aquaman.

A TECHNICIAN in a labcoat hands her form to Sitterson.
As he looks at it ~~

SITTERSON (CONT'D)
I’m not even sure we have one of these...

TECHNICIAN
Zoology swears we do.

SITTERSON
(shrugs, takes her money)
Well, they'd know.

Across the room, A YOUNG GUY who looks a lot like an
INTERN hands his form to Hadley --

HADLEY
(xe: form)
No no -~ they've already been picked.

INTERN
(angry)
What? Who took ‘em?

HADLEY
Maintenance,

INTERN
Maintenance! They pick the same thing
every year.

Lin is off to the side, where Truma:
stoically watching the Proceedings.

HADLEY
What do you want from me? If they were
creative, they wouldn't be in
Maintenance. If you win, you’re gonna
have to split it. You wanna switch?

INTERN
(thinks, then)
Nah. Leave it. I gota feeling on this
one.

LIN
Not betting?

TRUMAN
Not for me, thanks.

LIN
Seems a little harsh, doesn’t it. It’s
just people letting off steam.
(looks at Hadley and
Sitterson)
This job isn’t eaay, however those clowns
may behave.

TRUMAN
Does fhe Director... do they know about
it downstairs?

HADLEY
(joining them)
The Director doesn’t concern himself with
stuff like this. Long as everything goes
smoothly upstairs and the kids do... what
they’re told...

TRUMAN
But then it’s fixed.
(off their looks)
How can you wager on this when you
control the outcome?

33.

in stands at attention,

Hadley glances up at the monitors. ON THE SCREENS -~ we
see Dana, Holden, Jules, Curt, and Marty crossing through

the cabin, heading towards the living room.

HADLEY

No no. We just get ‘em to the cellar,

Truman. They take it from there.

34.

SITTERSON
They have to make the choice of their own
free will. Otherwise, system doesn’t
work. Like the harbinger: creepy old
fuck practically wears a sign saying “you
WILL DIE”, why would we put him there?
The system. They have to choose to
ignore him. They have to choose what
happens in the cellar. Yeah, we rig the
game as much as we have to but in the
end, if they don’t transgress..,

Hadley counts the money --

HADLEY
++.they can’t be punished. Last chance,
Truman. Window's closing.

TRUMAN
I'm fine.

HADLEY
(yells to the crowd)
All right! That’s it, gang. The board
is locked.

He hands the rest of the money to Sitterson, who slams it
on the pile with the rest of the cash,

SITTERSON
(looking at screens)
Let’s get this party started!

INT. CABIN - LIVING ROOM — NIGHT

Curt pumps the keg, sprays beer into a plastic cup as
Jules puts on a song --

CURT
Let’s get this party started!

He hands the beer to Jules, who dances through frame in
time to the music pumping out of the stereo.

HOLDEN
Oh, I’ve played before -- I don’t really
get the third part.

DANA
Well that’s our own thing.

JULES
It takes it to a whole new level.
 

 

 

35.

HOLDEN
Okay, whose turn... Marty. Truth or Dare
or... Lecture.

MARTY
I could go for a lecture.

HOLDEN
(the pressure’s on)
Perfect. Lecture.

MARTY
Wait, hang on --

He a grabs a joint, lights it, and takes a Massive hit.
But he doesn’t exhale. He just looks at Holden —- all
right, bring it on...

HOLDEN
(lecture mode)
Marty Mikalski, you are... squandering
your potential,

Marty nods -- true.

HOLDEN (CoNrT’D)

You've... anesthetized yourself to the
outside world; you're hiding in a womb
made of reefer. It’s time you “gave
birth” to the real Marty.

(to the others, into it)
I think he’ll find there’s more to life
than getting high.

Marty exhales a huge cloud of smoke as the group
applauds.

MARTY
(genuine)
Thank you for opening my eyes to whatever
it was you just said.
(then)
Jules! Truth or Dare or Lecture.

JULES
Let’s go dare!

MARTY
All right.
(thinks)
I dare you to make out with --

CURT
+++please say Dana, please say Dana..,

—~.
36.

MARTY
-- that moose over there.

Everyone turns, looks to where he’s pointing. MOUNTED on
THE WALL is the large, snarling WOLF’S HEAD. For the
record, it couldn't look less like a moose.

DANA
Um, Marty... have you seen a moose
before?

MARTY
Whatever that mysterious beast is --

CURT HOLDEN
It’s a wolf, Yeah, it’s a wolf.

MARTY (CONT’D)
I’m living in a womb of reefer, leave me
alone.
(then)
Jules, I dare you to make out with the
wolf.

Jules nods, takea a drink, hops to her feet.

JULES
No problem.

The group cheera. As Jules makes her way acrogs the
cabin, she drops her hips a bit, adding a sultry swagger
to her step.

WOLF’S POV: We're looking out at the cabin as Jules
walks right by us. And just as she’s about to exit
frame, she stops in her tracks. Looks over at us.

She glances over her shoulder. Bashful. Looks back at
us wolf, points to her chest.

JULES (CONT'D)
Who? Me?
(pretends to listen, then)
I am new in town, how did you know?

Everyone laughs, cheering her on. But Jules pretends
they’re not even there __ it’s just her and the wolf.

She blushes, twirls her hair around her finger —~

JULES (CONT'D)
(to the wolf)
Oh my god, that is so sweet of you to
say. I just colored it, in fact...

JULES (CONT’D)
(then)
Yes I'd love a drink, thank you.

She steps towards the wolf, then acts like she trips --

JULES (CONT'D)
Whoops --
(looks towards the ground)
I seem to have dropped my birth control
pills all over the ground...

While the group hoots and hollers, Jules turns around,
bends over right in front of the wolf. Pretends like
she’s picking something from the ground.

Then, without turning around, she stands up straight, so
that the wolf is now directly over her shoulder. She
nuzzles it, cheek to cheek --

JULES (CONT’D)
Oh.. Mr. Wolf. You're so big. And bad.
(then)
No no no -- there’s no need to huff and

puff... i

She turns around, takes the wolf's head in her hands --

JULES (CONT'D)
I’ll let you come in.

And with that, Jules leans in and gives the wolf the most.
passionate kiss we've ever seen. She just goes for it --
full-on, tongue-to-taxidermied-wolf-tongue action.

The group loses their minds. Everyone leaps to their
feet, giving Jules a standing ovation.

Jules looks to the group, takes a bow even as she makes a
face, spitting out stuffed-wolftaste. As she walks back
to the group, Curt hands Jules her beer, the others keep
applauding --

HOLDEN
I didn’t know it was possible, but I
think you just officially won Truth or

Dare.
DANA
Or Lecture.
HOLDEN
Sorry. ( y
 

 

38.

JULES
The night is still young. Now then...
Dana --

CURT
(bored)
“Truth.”

Dana frowns. Glances at Curt --
DANA
What’s that supposed to mean?

CURT
I’m just skipping ahead.
(to explain)

DANA
(studies him)
Really.

CURT
(mods)
Or “Leature”.

DANA
No, I wouldn’t want one of those...

ANGLE MARTY -- he’s glancing at curt, Frowning.
Something about all this seems a little off...

And Dana seems to notice it too. But she’s not about to
let Curt get under her skin --

DANA (CONT’D)
Okay, Jules...
(defiant)
Da:

 

And just then, behind her -- WH-WHAM -- the cellar door
blows open. Everyone screams, startled.

JULES
What the hell was that?

They all look back at the now-open hole in the floor, As
they move toward it --

DANA
It’s the cellar door...
 

39.

MARTY
I thought it was locked.

CURT
The wind must have blown it open...

S
What wind...?

They all cluster around the hole. A set of stairs leads
down into the foreboding darkness. The group stares down
at it, all a little spooked --

HOLDEN
What do you think’s down there?
JULES
(shrugs)
Why don’t we find out?
(then)

Dana...
Dana glances up at her. What?

JULES (CONT'D) iF)
I dare you to go down into the cellar.

And we’re CLOSE ON DANA as she tries not. to show just how
much that scares her. OFF HER LOOR --

INT. CELLAR

Crrreak. Dana cautiously makes her way down the old
wooden staircase. It’s dark; Dana's flashlight barely
illuminates three feet in front of her.

She reaches the landing. Tries to keep her voice steady
as she calls back to the others --

DANA
How long do I have to stay down here?

Ct
Oh, you know, just ‘til morning...

She stands at the base of the stairs, trains the
flashlight beam around the room. Curiosity getting the
better of her, she steps into the darkness,

Creak...

ae

The flashlight beam scans the room, catching a glint of a
metal -- OLD RUSTY TOOLS hang from hooks along the walls.
 

 

 

40.

Creak...

Dana keeps moving, heart pounding in her chest. Her
flashlight sweeps the area, finding a dusty old RECORD
PLAYER... a CHILD'S TOY CHEST... a dressmaker’s
MANNEQUIN...

Dana turns, beam sweeping across the wall. As it does
so, it finds --

A GHOSTLY FACE.

Staring right at her. Dana screams, nearly jumps out of
her skin --

HOLDEN (0.8. )}
Dana?

As footsteps ring out from above, Dana angles the light
back towards the face, realizes --

It’s a PORTRAIT. A daguerrotype, to be Precise, of a
young woman, roughly fifteen, dressed in turn of the
century garb. She stares back at Dana with sad eyes.

HOLDEN (CoNT’D)
You okay?

Dana turns to find Holden racing down the stairs, the
others right behind him.

DANA
Yeah. Sorry. I just --
(embarrassed)
I just scared myself. It was stupid.

CURT
You called for help. Voids the dare.
Take your top off,

Marty strikes a match, lights an OLD oIL LANTERN hanging
from the wall. As orange light spills across the room...

HOLDEN
Oh my god...

++.they get a full view of THE CELLAR. The room is big --
much bigger than we expected -- and every dark corner
seems to be filled with creepy clutter.

JULES
Look at all this...
9

ie

41.

MARTY
Uh, guys, I’m not sure it’s awesome to be
down here.

But the others aren't even listening to him. They spread
out, each focusing on a different part of the cellar --

Holden looks down at a variety of CHILD’S Toys scattered
across the floor. He picks up an ORNATE MUSIC BOX --

HOLDEN
Dude, seriously -- your cousin’s into
some weird shit.

Curt has picked up a CONCH when he sees a WOODEN SPHERE
sitting behind it. He puts the conch down and hoists the
sphere. It almost looks like a small globe, it’s s0
ornately carved, but it has dusty brass rings inlaid
around it -- it can be turned and adjusted almost like a
spherical Rubik’s cube.

CURT
Yeah, pretty sure this ain’t his. Maybe
the people who put in that window...

Dana can’t take her eyes off the portrait of the girl.

On the vanity below it, she notices a variety of personal
effects: an old hairbrush... a silver mirror... and a
leather-bound BOOK.

DANA
Some of this stuff looks really old.

Jules studies the dressmaker’s mannequin. AN AMULET
hangs around its neck. Jules touches it...

JULES
(almost to herself)
It’s beautiful...

MARTY
Maybe we should go back upstairs...
(then)
I dare you all to go upstairs?

But even Marty can’t help but be intrigued as he spots an
OLD SUPER-8 PROJECTOR. He finds a film reel, starts
unspooling it...

HAUNTING MUSIC fills the air as Holden starts winding the
crank on the music box...

Curt starts turning the sphere parts -- they seem to be
lining up...

QO
  

 

42.

Dana brushes the dust off the book, revealing the word
“DIARY” on the cover...

Jules takes the amulet off the mannequin, holds it up to
her neck, looks for the clasp -- as though she were about
to try it on...

Marty holds the film strip up to the light, frowns as he
tries to discern what’s on it...

As Holden continues to wind the crank, the music BUILDS
and BUILDS... He’s staring down at the box-lid -- it’s as
though something’s about to pop right out of it... And
just as the music’s about to reach crescendo --

DANA
Guys.

Holden stops winding the crank. The world goes quiet.
Everyone looks up from what they're doing.

DANA (CONT‘D)
Guys, listen to this...

Reluctantly, each person puts down the object of his or
her attention and moves towards Dana.

DANA (CONT’D)
(reads from di.
“Today we felled the old birch tree out
back. I was sorrowed to see it go, as
Judah and I had sat up in its branches so

JULES
What is that?

Dana looks in the inside cover.

DANA (CONT'D)

MARTY

HOLDEN
You know, it’s uncommon that a girl out
here was reading and writing in that era,

“Mama screamed most of the night. I
prayed that she might find faith, but she
only stopped when papa cut her belly and

Bewildered, she flips ahead, continues;

MARTY
Jesus, can we not...

CURT
Go on.

MARTY
Why?

CURT
Suck it up or bail, pothead! I wanna
know.

Dana looks around. Holden gives her a little nod,

will be restored, our love will be
unending, and the Great Pain will
return.”

(looks up)

And there's something in Latin.

MARTY
Okay, I am drawing a line in the fucking
sand here, do not read the Latin.

A small voice seems to whisk across the top of the room,
barely audible:

VOICE
Read it....

Marty is the only one who seems to hear it. He looks
around...

The fuck..?

VOICE
Read it, out loud...

Marty starts across the room as Dana appears to be about
to start. Curt planta a hand in his chest and shoves him

Sitterson walks over to Hadley. He’s just standing

there, staring up at the screens. Looking a little
despondent -~

SITTERSON
I’m sorry, man.

He had the conch in his hands...

Hadley nods -- I Suppose you’re right. He gestures
towards the screens,

HADLEY
So... the Buckners, huh?

SITTERSON
I know.

Well, they may be zombified pain-

group calisthenics or something...

And as Sitterson and Hadley clear frame, we HOLD ON ONE
OF THE MONITORS.

ON THE SCREEN: we see a video feed of a JAPANESE SCHOOL

from a SOPPING WET YOUNG GIRL who’s floating through the
air like she's hanging from an invisible noose. as the
children SCREAM and SCREAM, the WET GIRL floats TOWARDS
US and we CUT To --

INT. LIVING ROOM ~ NIGHT

The msio is blaring and Jules is dancing up a storm.

Curt is going with it, occasionally getting behind her
for the butt-cupping dance, but she’s all over the yoom --
really working it. Pops a couple of buttons to show more
cleavage.

Everyone else is sitting, Dana and Holden on the couch,
Dana still holding the book, and Marty slumped in
armchair, smoking sullenly.

Jules dances over in front of Holden and does a little
impromptu lap-dance wriggle for him. He looks a little
awkward, glancing at Dana, who isn’t exactly thrilled.

CURT
Go baby, oh yeah... that’s the goods
right there, fuck yeah.

MARTY

This is so classy.
CURT

JULES

She moves to him, gives him a little wriggle action as
she takes his joint and sucks hard.

hall.

We made out once. TI never did buy that

Dana stands, dropping the book on the couch.

DANA
Jules, do you want to lie down?

CURT
That's exactly the point!
(pushes Jules to the door)
Mush! Mush!

JULES
(not upset)
Don’t push me around.

CURT
Not around, baby, straight line. Right

They exit, as Dana crosses to get another beer and Holden 7

MARTY
It’s cool, it’s not —- when does Curt

DANA
Marty, I love you, but you're really

MARTY

(dead serious)
We are not who we are.
(closes his eyes)
I’m gonna read a book with pictures.

He ambles off into his bedroom as Dana comes back to the
couch with a beer for herself and Holden. He takes his,
still holding the book.

HOLDEN
(translating)
“The pain outlives the flesh. The flesh
returns... or re... has a meeting
Place... towards the pain’s ascension”.

What‘s that?
HO!
The Latin. That you...

DANA
You speak Latin?

HOLDEN
Not well, and not since tenth grade.
Weird how it comes back.

He sips his beer, tosses the book back on the couch.
DANA
Well, it’s a weird night. I’m so sorry
about... tonight. Everybody.
HOLDEN
Do I lose points if I tell you I'm having
a pretty nice time?
She smiles, looks down.

DANA
No. You can tell me that.

EXT. WOODS - NIGHT
Jules is laughing, running through the woods, Curt in hot

pursuit. He catches her around the waist with one hand,
beer still held in the other.

JULES
Ah! Don’t spill on me!

CURT

He kisses her, deep and hard.

He starts pulling at the last buttons. She pulls away a
little.

JULES
Not here...

CURT
Oh, come on...

INT. CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

They're suddenly on three huge screens, being shot with a
remote caliera on a long lens, with fifteen workets low in
frame watching them intently.

CURT
++-ewe’re all alone...

EXT. WOODS - CONTINUOUS

He pulls the shirt open but she takes a step back and
holds it together.

JULES
I’m chilly.

INT. CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

A groan throughout the crowd cause Hadley to stand up
from the control area behind them.

HADLEY
Okay, that’s enough, everybody out. Job
to do.

As they are herded out by Truman, Hadley sits, saying to
Sitterson:

HADLEY (CONT’D)
We got temperature control in that
sector?

SITTERSON

He types fast on a keyboard, uses a touch-screen
thermometer gage to raise the heat.

Hadley is working his own controls...

HADLEY
Okay.... Engaging the pheromone mists...

EXT. WOODS - CONTINUOUS

AT THEIR FEET we actually see wisps of fog rise from the
ground.

Jules, still holding her shirt together, closes her eyes
and takes a deep breath through her nose. She opens her
eyes, looking at Curt with half-lidded lust. He goes in

JULES
It’s so dark... I'm gonna get twig-butt.
Take me inside.

CURT
Baby, this is why we came here... it’s
romantic...

He starts to turn her, pulling her open shirt away from
her neck and kissing it from behind...

INT. CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS
The boys are working in concert now.

SITTERSON
(to himself, singing)
Music and moonlight and love and
romance...

He pushes a lever -- literally a dimmer -- up as he hums.
And:

54.

EXT. WOODS - CONTINUOUS

Before the kids, a tiny glen of moss and soft green
fronds suddenly seems to glow in the moonlight. It
couldn't be more inviting.

Jules smiles, dizzy with luat.

ANGLE: GROUND LEVEL -- Jules drops down into frame, Curt
on her, the two of them only about the business. They
roll over, Jules on top, sliding her hand down Curt’s
pants -- he moans with longing, running his hand up her
chest over her bra.

INT. CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The men watch the screens, hands at the ready to
manipulate any dial. They have the dispassionate focus
of porn theater patrons.

HADLEY

(quietly)
Okay, boobies, boobies...

SITTERSON
Show us the goods...

Truman looks over at them, a little disturbed.

TRUMAN
Does it really matter if we see --

HADLEY
(not looking around)
We're not the only ones watching, kid.

SITTERSON
Got to keep the customer satisfied.
(does turn)
You understand what's at stake here?

TRUMAN
(nodding)
Sorry.

Sitterson turns back to the screens, and the two men
watch their handiwork.

INT. CONTROL ROOM/EXT. WOODS - CONTINUOUS

And now we cut back and forth a bit.
 

 

« (J

Curt, kneeling, slides Jules’s pants off. His head comes
back into frame and takes the edge of her panties in his
mouth, making a little growl as he lets go and it snaps
back on her waist --

Jules laughs, leaning her head back and suddenly not
laughing, breathing hard...

Hadley and Sitterson stare, (looking perhaps directly
into camera to make us even less comfortable)...

Jules swings on top and pulls her shirt off at last. She
takes her time, sliding her hands up her belly to her
breasts, finally to the clasp in the middle of her bra...

She pops it open, holding it together coyly for one
moment before pulling the bra off, revealing her breasts,
a sheen of sweat (and the fact that they’re not fake)
making them all the more enticing. She smiles knowingly,
a vision of hedonistic perfection.

Curt looks up at her in silent wonder.

All three men in the control room -- including Truman -- .
look at her the exact same way. ( 2

As Curt slides his hand over her ghest, she leans down
into him, his arms coming around her back.

HADLEY
Score.

SITTERSON
Eat that, Stockholm...

He makes a small tweak on a dial, eyes still on the
screen.

ANGLE: ABOVE THE LOVERS the camera comes softly down
towards them, the tableau romantic and sensual. He's

atop her and a bit to the side, one hand (out of frame)
working under her panties as she moans, arms out...

CLOSE ON: HER HAND, running along the soft moss.
A rusty trowel nails it to the earth.

Jules SCREAMS, rearing up --- hampered by the hand that
won't move, as Curt tumbles off her, looking up to see:

Three zombies (as they will be called from now on) are
attacking them.
O,

a

“sal?

56.

Skinny JUDAH is crouching over Jules, pulling his trowel
out even as MOTHER reaches around her neck with her
snaggle-toothed saw. MATTHEW, the biggest, is still a
few feet behind, ambling towards.

CLOSE ON: THE MOTHER'S BELLY as three burning coals flop
out of a slit in it, sizzling on Jules’s hair and the
moss.

She starts to draw the saw along Jules’s neck and curt
snaps out of it. He piledrives right into Mother --

CURT
Fuck away from her!

-- knocking her back on her ass. He turns to Judah just
as Judah digs the trowel into his arm. Curt howls,
trying to pull it out as Jules holds her bleeding neck,
trying to rise but weak.

Curt pulls his arm away, bringing Judah towards him and
then punches Judah hard right in the nose. The nose
breaks easily, crumbling a bit, Judah completely unfazed
by it. Curt looks over towards the third zombie.

Matthew stands a few feet away, leaning slightly.
Suddenly he lets a chain slide through his fingers, all
the way to the ground, pulled by a broken bear-trap, just
a rusty metal jaw with teeth: a turn-of-the-century mace
and chain.

Matthew grins.

The trap swings with sudden speed, whacking Curt’s head
(luckily not with the jagged side) and knocking him back,
bleeding and dazed.

JULES
Curt!

She tries to rise and Matthew swings again, digging the
claw of the trap into her back. She SCREAMS, arching
back and flopping face-down onto the ground, digging her
fingers into the earth as Matthew drags her backwards.

Curt stumbles up -- and Father is behind him, slipping
the shaft of his scythe over Curt’s head and pulling it
back hard against Curt’s throat. Curt thrashes, unable
to scream, as his feet are pulled off the ground. He
sees:

The screaming, pleading, whimpering Jules is kept in
place by Matthew’s foot as he yanks out the trap.
 

 

57.

Judah pulls her hair back, holding up her head -- her
eyes on Curt’s -- as Mother places the broken blade once
more at her throat. curt watches in silent horror.

Inside the control room, the men are equally silent,
Truman trying hard not to lose it as Jules’s pleas fill
the air around.

CLOSE ON: JULES’S PLEADING EYES as we hear the horrible
scrape of the saw tearing flesh.

No sound in the console at all save scraping and
shuffling. ‘Truman has his eyes closed. Hadley and
Sitterson both have lowered their heads, and Sitterson
quietly intones:

SITTERSON
This we offer in humility and fear, for
the blessed peace of your eternal
slumber. As it ever was.

HADLEY
As it ever was.

Sitterson pulla a short necklace from under his shirt. \ 3
On it is a weird pagan symbol, five pointed but not a

pentagram. He kisses it and replaces it under his shirt

as Hadley crosses behind him to a series of five mahogany

panels at the far end of the room.

He opens the first and presses an ornate brass lever
down.

CLOSE ON: A MECHANISM almost like an old clock, Jules
Verne-esque. A small hammer strikes a vial that cracks,
dark red blood pouring out into a brass funnel that runs
down a thin pipe, seemingly a very long way.

INT. THE CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

The pipe ends in the ceiling of a dark room we won't
really see just yet. The blood pours out onto a leaning
slab of dark marble, right into a groove at the top. The
blood races down the groove as it bends and arcs
different ways, forming a primitive picture of some sort
-- though of what, we do not yet see.

EXT. WOODS - CONTINUOUS

Judah hisses at us.
 

 

58.

Drop wide to see Curt has stopped struggling, Father
still holding him as Judah and Mother amble toward him.
Matthew is bent over Jules’s corpse, but we can't see
what he’s doing, thankfully.

As they raise their blades, curt springs into action,
planting his feet on both of them and pushing as hard as
he can, knocking them back -- and Father as well, Curt
rolling over him and pulling himself free.

Gasping for breath, Curt scrambles on hands and knees
back towards the cabin, almost on his feet -- and the
blade of Father's scythe slices through the cuff of his
jeans, pulling his leg and dropping him back to earth.

INT. MARTY’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Marty is lying in bed on his back as he reads Curious
George.

MARTY
George, man, don’t do it! It’s ether!
You’re gonna act the fool!

Letting out a breath, he drops tha book to his chest.

Dana and Holden are leaning in for a kiss when Marty

MARTY
He’s got a husband bulge.

They look at each other awkwardly, the moment broken.

Marty shuts the door behind him.

EXT. CABIN - CONTINUOUS

We walk out with Marty, leaving the

house behind. He

comes out about thirty yards, near the first trees. In

medium close-up, he looks up...

MARTY
I thought there’d be stars...

(sighs)
We are abandoned.

And he starts to take a piss. All of which is held at
this close angle, 80 we only hear it.

There’s a noise in the woods behind. He turns around to
see a copse of trees, but no movement. Turns back and in
the BG one of the trees turna out to be a figure -- a

silhouetted girl with only one arm,

She makes her way slowly toward him,

holding a hatchet.

I don’t mean ‘never’, but...

Hey. Nothing you don’t want.

They start to kiss again...

WHAM! Curt spills onto his knees in the doorway. Dana
and Holden race to him, gasping as they see his bloody
wounds --

HOLDEN (CONT'D)
Jesus -- what happened?

MARTY

Marty’s right behind Curt -- as he races inside -- curt
grabs the door, slams it shut. Gasps for air. Dana
races to his side, tries to examine his wounds --

DANA
(frantic)
Where are you hurt?
(re: blood)
Is this all from you?
(then)
Where's Jules?

Curt pushes her away, shakes his head. Tears spring to
his eyes -- he’s clearly in shock. Holden tries to calm

him down --

HOLDEN
It’s okay, Curt. You’re okay...

MARTY

No. We're not okay. What’s the opposite

He’s already moving towards the back of the cabin.

DANA
No -- wait --

Dana reaches for the front door. Starts to open it...

MARTY
Dana -- don’t open that --

DANA
I’m not leaving here without Jules.

+eeand she swings the door open, revealing --

MATTHEW.

He’s atanding on the porch, framed in the doorway. Just
staring at us. Holding something round down by his side.

He tosses it rigbt at Dana -- she gasps, catches it,
looks down to see --

It’s Jules’ HEAD.

Dana screams her heart out. She drops Jules’ head on the
ground, glances up as Matthew steps up the porch. She
screams and screams as Matthew approaches -- Holden dives
forward, slams the door shut just as --~

WHAM! Matthew slams into it. The frame shakes, the wood
splinters. Marty races forward, helps Holden brace the
door. As they slam the deadbolt into place --

Curt flips the couch over, tries to shove it against the
door. Looks up at Dana, who’s still in shock --

CURT
Dana -- c’mon --

Dana snaps out of it, helps Curt shove the couch under
the doorknob. WHAM! The whole cabin seems to shake as
Matthew slams into it -- (

Holden races across the living room, throws the deadbolt
on the back door.

DANA

More of them?

MARTY
(nods)
I saw a young girl -- all zombied, like
him. And “Little House on the Prairie”,

Dana’s face falls as she realizes —-

DANA
Oh god. Patience.

HOLDEN
“The pain outlives the flesh.”

She must have... bound a mystical
incantation into the text so someone

INWARD. Our group cries out in surprise, looks back to
see MATTHEW'S ARM now reaching through the window —-

CURT

As Curt starts shoving a bookcase up against the window,
Dana and Holden share a glance. Nod.

They race towards the back. Marty hesitates a moment,

frowning ---something about this isn’t quite right. But
then he shakes it off, hurries after them.

down the hall. As Hadley and Sitterson watch --

their separate rooms --

All the doors SLAM SHUT behind them, and: WH-CHUNK! We
hear vault-worthy locks slamming home.

Marty stops in his tracks. Glances back at the closed
door behind him. Again, he frowns -- Huh. That's
weird... But before he has time to consider it fully --

WHAM! The cabin shakea again. We hear glass breaking in
another room. Marty snaps out of it -- stick to the

As he dives for it, pulling it shut, he loses his
balance, knocks over the end table next to his bed --

shards of glass. Marty picks it up, sees there’s
actually a small, fiber optic CAMERA at the end of it —-

Judah Buckner to rescue...
INT. CABIN - MARTY’S ROOM
Marty pulls the camera wire taut, follows it up the

length of the wall. Stares up at the ceiling. We see
the realization hit him --

MARTY
Oh my god, I’m on a reality show.
(then)
My parents are gonna think I’m such a

burnout --

CRASH! Just then, the window behind Marty EXPLODES
INWARD -- Judah reaches through, grabs Marty by the neck,
yanks him backward, THROUGH THE WINDOW --—

Marty screams as Judah tries to pull him out of the
cabin. Marty struggles mightily -- he holds fast to the (
window frame, desperate to get back inside --

Sassen!

Judah growls, yanks Marty again. As Marty starts to lose
his grip on the window, he flails about, his free hand
searching the nearby dresser top for anything he can use
as a weapon --

And just as Judah yanks him one last time, Marty's
fingers close around the FRESCA CAN --

EXT. CABIN - CONTINUOUS

Judah hauls Marty straight out of the cabin window --
WHAM -- Marty slams into the ground -- he gasps in pain,
looks up just in time to see --

Judah plunging THE TROWEL down straight at Marty’s head.
Marty rolls to the side —— THUNK -- as Judah buries the
trowel into the ground next to him --

Marty struggles to his feet, but Judah’s right on top of
him. As Marty tries to fight him off, he glances down at
the Fresca can in his hand. He gives it a shake -—

C1-CLACK -- and it telescopes outward into the GIANT
BONG. Marty takes the makeshift baton, awings it with
all his might --

WHAM! He hits Judah flush in tha side of the head,
dropping him to the ground with a sickening thud.

Marty stares down at Judah’s crumpled body... but Judah's
only momentarily dazed... he’s already starting to get to
his feet. Marty doesn’t hesitate any longer... he bolts
towards the forest --

But as Marty races away at top speed, Judah takes the
trowel in hand --

And hurls it right at Marty's back.

Wh-CHUNK! Bullseye -- he hits Marty right between the
shoulder blades. Marty cries out in pain as he pitches
forward, crashes to the ground.

Judah slowly walks towards the fallen Marty...

ON THE GROUND -- Marty gasps in pain, tears in his eyes
as he desperately struggles to get the trowel out of his
back. He reaches behind him —- his fingers touch the
hilt, but they can’t find purchase...

Judah grabs Marty by the leg. starts dragging him into
the forest -~

-- and we're WITH MARTY as Judah drags him through the
treeline. They're heading towards a DARK HOLE in the
ground (from which Judah firet emerged). Marty tries to
struggle -- blood seeps from the wound in his back,
leaving a bloody trail through the dirt.

Marty’s fading fast... He coughs blood, tears stream down
his face --

MAR:
No -- HELP ME --

And as Judah drags him down into the hole, we STAY UP

TOP -- Marty struggles with everything he’s got -- his

TERRIFIED EYES stare back at us as he screams and

screams -- his fingers claw trails in the dirt around him

as he tries to hang on —- ( }

MARTY (CONT’D)

But it’s no use. And with a final yank, Marty disappears
from view entirely. His horrified screams echo through
the forest...

And then he’s gone.

INT. CONTROL ROOM
CLOSE ON A LEVER as a hand pulls it down -- CH-cHUNK ——

INT. CHAMBER

-- and once again, BLOOD trickles down, down, down
through the carved stone etchings. And as it flows
outward we slowly PULL BACK to reveal the picture forming
is of a PRIMITIVE HUMAN FIGURE. It is holding a goblet
and dancing.

We hear a RUMBLING...

INT. DANA’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Dana is laboriously moving a tall dresser in front of the ae
window, at which a zombie pounds.
68.

Suddenly the rumbling fills the room, which starts to
shake with what feels like a decent sized earthquake.
Dana looks around, almost exasperated in her terror --

DANA
What? No! No, come on!

INT. CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Hadley, Sitterson and Truman all pause to look around as
they too, are shaking. Hadley is returning from the
lever he just pulled down, turns to Sitterson with
shrug...

HADLEY
They’re getting excited downstairs.

SITTERSON
Greatest Show on Earth...

INT. DANA’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

The rumbling subsides and she turns her attention back to
the dresser. As she gets it in place she hears the
window shatter and the chest begina to rock. She shoves
the bed against it and goes for the door.

It won’t open. She pulls, kicks, but it’s locked solid.
She’s staring at it, confused -- it looks so flimsy --
when the chest goes over and a zombie starts climbing in.
She hits it with a lamp but it has no effect.

She sees a second one coming, backs up against the wall --
and the picture on it goes flying, glass shattering,
making her jump.

Holden knocks out the rest of the one-way mirror.
There’s banging in his room but no zombies in yet.

HOLDEN
My door’s stuck!
DANA
Mine too!
He looks at her sitch -- worse than his own -- and

beckons her to come through.

HOLDEN
Come on!
a!

od

She stands on the bed and wriggles through, with his
help, but not without some cuts, and they both fall to
the floor.

They're still rising when the furniture Holden has piled
up is knocked away -- By Matthew.

DANA
The bed!

They up-end it and shove it at the window, holding its
metal frame against the pounding from without. Dana
looks around for something else, sees:

ANGLE: UNDER THE BEDSPACE is a trapdoor.

DANA (CONT'D)
Holden.

He looks, puts his shoulder to the bed to take the weight
as he indicates for her to check it out. She moves to it
and pulls it open -- nothing but blackness below. She

looks back at Holden.
DANA (CONT'D) 2

Better or worse?

He sticks his foot out and slides a lamp to her. It’s
been set on the floor (during the furniture pile-up) but
still plugged in. She lowers it into the dark space,
lets it hang by its plug.

DANA (CONT'D)
It’s empty...

Holden gives the bed one last kick in place and moves to
the door, calling out:

HOLDEN
Curt! Curt!

The knob starts moving.

CURT

Unlock your door!

HOLDEN
I can’t! Get down to the basement! we
got a way down!

CURT oo

Holden moves to the edge of the space, takes a quick look
in and goes in head first, holding the edge and flipping
himself over to land on his feet. Dana slips down into
his upstretched arms right after, disappearing into the

hole.

INT. DARK ROOM - CONTINUOUS

It’s strangely quiet, as though it swallowed the noise
from above. The only light is from the dangling lamp,
and it throws the whole small room into a creepy half-
light. And creepy seems to be the general theme.

It’s a torture chamber, with a chair, chains, shackles,
and a table with some truly appalling instruments rusting
on it. Sweeney Todd would get squeamish in here.

They look around a bit, unwittingly fascinated.

DANA
This is the Dark Room.
HOLDEN
Which?
DANA
From the diary. This ia where he killed
them.
(quietly)
This is where he kills us.
HOLDEN
What?
DANA

(she’s cracking)
I brought us here. I found the room, the
diary... you’re all gonna die because of
me.

He takes her firmly by her arms.

HOLDEN
Nobody did this. Okay, it’s bad luck.
Horrible fucking luck but I’m not gonna
die and neither are you. We just gotta
find the door.

DANA
There isn’t one.

He looks -- she’s right.
 

 

 

71.

HOLDEN
In the wall, something. Just look.

She pulls herself together -- moves to the far wall,
grabbing something that looks like @ small crowbar,
running one hand along the wall for a hidden door and
tapping with the bar occasionally to teat the sound of

DANA
Curt?

Holden has moved to one wall, now crosses below the
trapdoor to the other ——

HOLDEN
Hidden rooms were a staple of post-civil
war architecture. There's gotta be a -~

-- and the bear-trap swings down from the trapdoor,
catching under his arm and digging into the back of his

shoulder. He SCREAMS as Matthew starta hoisting him up

through the trap-door. ( >

Dana runa to him and helps him struggle, finally
overbalancing Matthew, who falis forward, stuck upside
down halfway through the trap-door, still grabbing at
Holden on the floor.

Holden painfully pulls the trap from his shoulder -- but
Matthew gets a hold of him, his mouth wide in a hissing
scream --

. DANA
You like pain?

Dana runs the crowbar right through Matthew's face and
into the wall behind, Pinning him. Screams in his face:

DANA (CONT'D)
How’s that work for ya?

Matthew grabs the bar and pulls at it -- Holden getting
free -- and Dana finds a kitchen knife, stabs Matthew
with it several times, shaking with rage. Matthew
finally hangs limp. Dana stares at him, breathing hard.

CLOSE ON: THE KNIFE HANDLE as a small electrical charge
jolts Dana’s hand.

As we drop back wider, it looks like she’s dropping the
knife ‘cause she doesn’t like holding it. She turns her
back on Matthew, dragging Holden up. They move to the
other side of the room -- and the wall behind them opens,
Curt reaching in to grab them.

DANA

They exit into:

And make for the storm doors, pushing them open, Curt
grabbing a handy plank to hit zombies with.

They move as quickly as they can, both Holden and curt
being injured, not encountering any dead folk as they
race to the Rambler.

DANA.
What about Marty?

CURT
They got him.

They come around the Rambler, camera behind, and Curt
moves to open the door.

There is dirt on the latch.

He looks at Holden, steps back with his Plank as Holden
readies to open the door and get out of the way. A beat,
and Curt nods.

The door opens --

HARD CUT TO:

CLOSE ON: A HIDEOUS SCREAMING FACE of a Japanese floating
drowned girl. It suddenly stops, a warm glow building
around its now-bewildered face.

Cut wide to see:

INT. SCHOOLROOM IN JAPAN - NIGHT

The floaty girl hovers over the room, in which several
Japanese schoolchildren are Placing lotus flowers into a
large bowl of water on the floor, all the while singing a

happy song of love.

A frog hops out the bowl. The drowny girl is consumed by
light and disappears.

The whole tunnel is caving in as Curt slams on the
brakes, hits reverse and tears back out, the van stopping
a few yards from the din and smoke of total collapse.

WSSSHLICK -- A SCYTHE tears through Holden’s throat from
behind.

Blood splatters the windshield -- Dana SCREAMS -- she
glances hack to see -~

FATHER BUCKNER.

He*s right behind them, having crept up from his hiding
place in the Rambler. He growls as he tries to dislodge
his scythe from Holden's throat -- SHLOCK -- he pulls it
free -- arterial blood sprays everywhere, all over Dana ——

_ Dana continues to scream and Scream as Holden’s hands

instinctively clutch at his own throat -- the steering
wheel spins unchecked --

WH-SHLACK -- Father Buckner swings the scythe again, this
time lodging it in the side of Holden's head. Holden
pitches forward, the Rambler careens out of control,
leaps off the road and crashes --

Right into the lake.

SMASH! The front windshield SHATTERS -- lake water comes
rushing into the cab, blasting Dana straight back into
her seat --

Beside her, Holden continues to THRASH -- he’s still

swing it again but the water blasts him back to the rear

Lake water fills the cab -- within a matter of seconds,

screams, goes under --

And everything goes quiet.

Dana struggles underwater, panic in her eyes as she looks
over and sees Holden staring back at her. He’s still
holding his throat -- blood pours from his wounds --

Dana fights to free herself from the seatbelt -- she
shakes her head, CRIES OUT underwater as she holds
Holden’s gaze --

And WE'RE CLOSE ON HOLDEN as the life drains out of him.
As he stares at Dana, his hands go slack, blood gushes
from his throat, clouding the water around him until he
disappears entirely...

We’re WITH DANA as the Rambler continues to sink, the van
now perpendicular as it plummets straight down. She
tumbles upward, into the ceiling, towards the back. oe

Her hands reach out for anything, desperate to find
purchase. Her eyes dart upward, falling on --

The CEILING HATCH.

It’s small -- a basic ventilation hatch, no more than a
foot-and-a-half Square -- but now’s not the time to be
picky.

There’s a little bubble of air trapped in there, and Dana
shoves her face in it, gasps it greedily. It disappears
as she does and she pulls her head back, holding her
breath again --

CLOSE ON: FATHER, smiling in the dark water. He doesn’t
need to hold his breath.

EXT. DOCKS - NIGHT

WHAM! Dana’s body hits the dock hard. Matthew's bear
trap shatters the wood beside her -- the dock’s now in
splinters.

Dana looka terrible ~- she’s sopping wet, battered and
bloody, Clearly, Matthew's been kicking the hell out of
her. Dada can’t even stand -- tears in her eyes, she
tries to crawl away —- she sees a broken dock plank
beside her -- maybe it can be used as weapon -- she
reaches out for it -—

And Matthew steps down on her arm. Dana CRIES OUT... As
she tries to struggle, Matthew bears down... We're with

Dana as she realizes there’s nothing she can do... she’s
a8 good as dead...

WWHH-CHING -- A BONG catches the chain from behind. Lets
it wrap around and yanks it back --

Matthew jerks in surprise -- he stumbles backwards,
crashing down to the dock --

Dana rolls to her feet, looks back to see -~

His clothes are doused in blood, the wound on his back
looks pretty nasty... but he’s still breathing. Dana
can’t believe her eyes --

DANA
Marty!

But this is no time for tearful reunions. Matthew's
already struggling to hia feet beside them --

MARTY
Dana -- get away!

But she doesn’t run. As Matthew yanke his chain from
Marty's grasp, Dana grabs hold of the dock Plank beside
her. She swings it with all her might right at
Matthew --

CRACK! It hits him Square in the face -- he pitches
backwards right off the dock -- SPLASH -- into the lake.

Dana joins Marty and they are at a dead run.

SPLOOSH! Matthew re-emerges from the lake. Starts
moving through the water. Right towards them,

EXT. CABIN - NIGHT

Dana and Marty race towards the cabin. Behind them, we
can see Matthew emerge from the lake, following them --

DANA
Where are we going?

WHAM! UP AHEAD, the front door of the cabin flies open.
Framed in the doorway is MOTHER BUCKNER.

Dana and Marty both jump, scared. As Mother Buckner
steps out onto the Porch, Marty pulls Dana to the side --

MARTY
This way --~

They bolt around the side of the house, heading towards
the back. Mother Buckner follows...

EXT. CABIN/FOREST - NIGHT

~~ Marty and Dana race around the corner of the cabin.
Marty heads straight for the treeline. UP AHEAD —_ we
see the edge of the ‘grave’ Judah dragged Marty into
earlier,

DANA
Marty -- wait --

Sccerrr... Dana looks over, sees Mother Buckner round the
corner of the cabin. Dragging her saw by her side...

MARTY
Dana, c’mon --

DANA
(to Marty)
We're going in there?

Shlop... Shlop... the sound of Matthew's wet footsteps
ring out as he comes around the other side of the cabin.

MARTY
I need you to keep the faith right now,
sister ~~

Fwish -- in the forest UP AHEAD, Patience Buckner breaks
through the treeline.

ON DANA -- as she sees Mother, Matthew, and Patience all
closing in on her. She's trapped. She knows it. So it
takes her all of one second to make the decision --

Marty kneels by the hole in the ground and opens it
further like a storm door. on top, sod and leaves,
Underneath, smooth, clean metal.

Looking apprehensive, Dana slides in and Marty SLAMS the
door shut on top of them.

We stay outside, looking down, holding on the door in the
earth for a beat. And then --

Patience Buckner slides down the embankment. She
awkwardly tries to Paw at the metal door with her one
hand. And as she scratches at the metal, she lets out a
chilling cry of zombie frustration --

INT. UNDERGROUND SPACE - CONTINUOUS

The sound of Dana’s breath echoes off the metal walls of
this small, dark chamber. It’s only tall enough to
crouch in, but a good twelve feet by twelve feet, with a
square metal door in the middle of the floor. The light
in the room comes from a panel in the metal that’s been
Popped out, a few glowing cables behind, including a
couple that have been messed with. As Dana looks more
closely...

DANA
What is this place?

She steps on something soft, jerks back as she realizes
it’s Judah's mewling face. He’s been completely
dismembered and piled up in the corner, but his bits
still twitch.

MARTY
Yeah, I hadda dismember that guy with a
trowel. What’ve you been up to?

She looks at him, bewildered and despairing.

MARTY (CONT’D)
Nobody else, huh?

She shakes her head.

MARTY (CONT’D)
I figured.

DANA
You figured everything.

MARTY
Not even close, but I do know some stuff.
As in:

He goes to the door in the floor and slides it open. She
looks down: it’s a small metal elevator. Two sides are
thick glass, but they are up against the metal shaft so
tight you might not even tell.

MARTY (CONT'D)
It’s an elevator. Somebody sent these
dead fucks up to get us. There's no
controls inside but there's maintenance
overrides in there. I been Playing
around. I think I can make it go down.

DANA
Do we wanna go down?

MARTY
Where else we gonna go?

A beat, and she scrambles down into it as he moves to the
open panel.

MARTY (CONT’D)
Get ready -- the timing on this might be
pretty tight.

INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS
She moves against the wall, looking up.

Marty flicks a switch and slides right into the hole as
the elevator whirs to life and the door starts sliding
shut. He barely makes it -- and one of Judah’s arms
falls in with him, the two of them doing the get-away-
from-it dance even as they brace themselves against the
sudden plummet.

MARTY
(kicking it to the side)
Ab! Fuckin’ zombie arm!

The elevator starts down -- not too fast -- and it is
shaken by another tremor.

EXT. WOODS - CONTINUOUS

The tremor rocks Patience as well. At its height, we
hear metal scraping and the hatch grinds open a sliver.
Patience looks at it, her head cocked curiously.

INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

It seems to go down a good long while -- then joltingly
stops. They look at each other -- nothing opens -- then
it starts moving again...

MARTY
Are we moving sideways?

Dana is leaning against the glase when the elevator
suddenly comes abreast of another elevator, also with a
thick glass wall, and stops --

[7 _@ ravenous WEREWOLF leaps at her as she turns -- she
jumps back as it hits the glass, clawing at it and
drooling. Marty stares in incomprehension.
 

 

 

 

92.

MARTY (CONT ’D)
So, no...

Both of them press up against the opposite wall -- ang
the elevator moves sideways again, revealing a Gigeresque

The elevator is jerked down -- then sideways, revealing
this time one on each side. Dana sees:

A little girl ina ragged ballerina outfit (not a tutu,
but a limp, torn skirt). She has no face, just a ceircle-
mouth with a ring of teeth,

Marty sees:

A staring man in a long, leather, futuristic coat. He’s
dead white, has no hair and buzzsaws stuck in his head in

a neat row. His arms are ringed with barbed wire stuck

in deep. He is grinning at Marty and holding a flowing p
sphere almost rr, CC in the cellar. ‘2

DANA
(realizing)
We chose,..

MARTY
(looking over at hers)
What?

The elevator moves back down into darkness.

DANA
In the cellar. all that shit we were
Playing with... They made us choose,
(beat)
They made us choose how we die.

The incomprehension builds in her and she punches the
glass. It doesn’t make a crack but she keeps going,
pounding away with both fists like a prize-fighter going
for body blows —- Marty tries to hold her and she
screams, thrashing as we drop back wide to see:

An endless array of elevators. Moving around like a 3-D
puzzle, like Charlie's Great Glass Elevator, like “Cube”,
Monsters (many of them like the ones we've seen) in every
single one. It’s the Costco of death.

INT. CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Everyone has cleared out except Wendy and our hero three.
She’s in the lower Part, on console, earpiece in. The
men are going through every part of the building on their
screens, moving fast and frightened.

Sitterson watches nine constantly changing views of
monsters in elevators, looking for the kids.

SITTERSON
(into com)
We saw them go down the access drop, they
have to be in one of these! Internal
security should be able to -- I don’t
care if that’s not Protocol! Are you
fucking high?

Hadley, over this, is looking at halls and stairwells,
(many of them being swept by security teams), also
talking on an earpiece:

HADLEY
It’s the stonert Nol You can’t touch
the girl -- If he outlivea her all this
goes to hell! Take him out first.

LIN
(to the guys)
Clean-up says the prep team missed one of
the kid’s stashes. Whatever he’s been
smoking has been immunizing him to all
our shit.

HADLEY
How does that help us right now?
(into com)
What? Yes. If you have a confirmed kill
you can take her out too.

TRUMAN
There!

He’s looking at the elevator screens. Sitterson freezes
them from changing, then puts their screen on all nine.

SITTERSON
Thirty six oh six, Gotchya,.

HADLEY
Bring ‘em down.

INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

Marty is holding Dana, who's breathing hard but calm, as
the elevator goes down. The elevator stops and the door
opens into a sort of lobby. Instantly a GUARD is
stepping one foot in, gun at their heads. Dana is a
little in front of Marty, standing exhausted, haunted,
her knuckles -- and much else of her -- bloody.

GUARD

Out of the elevator!

(beat)

Step out of the elevator!
DANA

Why are you trying to kill us?
GUARD

Step out! Just the girl!
DANA

Just me?
GUARD

He moves forward and Judah’s arm grabs his foot. He
wigs, shooting at it.

Dana takes the moment to rush him --

INT. LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

Pushing him back -- he lifts the gun and Marty knocks the
guard’s arm so his gun points straight at his own chin --
it goes off...

The guard falls against the wall, clutching at his
bloodspurts as Marty takes the gun.

MARTY
(ala “Lassie”:)
Good work, zombie arm!

They look around. There are eight elevator wells, four
on each side, with a corridor turn behind from which we
can hear the tromp of approaching guards. on the other
side is a small guard station, which this dead fellow
presumably came out of, since the door is ajar. The
guard station has glass along the top half, as thick and
unbreakable as the elevators’,

As the kids get their bearings, a voice comes over a

Hadley and Sitterson listen as well. On their screens,
we see Marty and Dana in a corridor -- and a SWAT-lookin’
team creeping down another.

nightmare creatures. And they are real.

Marty pulls at Dana, handing her the trowel as they head
to the empty guard station,

INT. GUARD STATION/LOBBY — CONTINUOUS

They are closing the door behind them when it is peppered
with gunfire. They slam it shut and lock it, keeping low
even though the glass isn’t even cracking yet.

Marty looks up: the lobby is full of approaching

guards -- SWAT-looking guys who keep a steady pound of
bullets coming.

Dana looks at the console in here, realization dawning on
her:

ANGLE: THE CONSOLE controls all the elevators. And
there’s a button that says “PURGE”,
DANA
An army of nightmares, huh?
She looks at the guards, at Marty. Back at the console.

DANA. (CONT’D)
Let’s get this Party started.

She hits “purge”.

In the hall, the sound of the elevators is audible. The
lead guard holds his fist up.

LEAD GUARD
Hold fire! Hold fire!

They finally do, and there’s a moment of quiet.
ANGLE: DOWN THE HALL.

We can see every elevator door open, but not what’s
inside. Another moment as the men between turn to look.

Werewolves, Aliens, Mutants and Robots Pour out of the
elevators at crazy speed, decimating the men even as they
begin to fire, It’s a warzone in @ second.

ANGLE: RUNNING DOWN THE ADJOINING HALL with the next
group of guards, they turn the corner to see horrible
Chaos ~- and the doors open again, the next batch of
horrors sweeping out directly at them.

 
 

97.

ANGLE: DANA AND MARTY are sitting with their backs
against the walls, listening to all manner of screams and
weird sounds and things bumping or smearing against the
window above.

INT. VARIOUS:
As the carnage continues:

ANGLE: FROM INSIDE AN ELEVATOR as it opens, and an alien
rockets out at the guard turning to us and firing.

ANGLE: IN A CORRIDOR a guard runs from a floating,
screaming witch, who grabs his head and mystically sucks
the life out of it.

INT. CONTROL ROOM - A BIT LATER

There is chaos on every screen. Wendy is silent and near
tears. Truman has his weapon at the ready. Hadley and
Sitterson are still working.

SITTERSON
Why aren’t the defenses working? Where's
the fucking gas?

HADLEY
Something chewed through the connections,
in the utility shaft.

SITTERSON
Something which?

HADLEY
Something scary!

The lights go out, the screens go dead. And something
hits the door hard enough to buckle it.

INT. GUARD STATION/LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

The two are still cowering when something smashes though
the glass and into the wall across. It starts
unfurling... It’s a DRAGONBAT.

DANA
Shit!

She makes for the door, Marty right behind. They open it
and head out, keeping low.

The dragonbat pulls him back, eating his entrails, and
Dana looks at the hole in the wall. There is a stone
corridor beyond, different than any of the rest of this
Place. Older.

Marty is watching the corridor -- a couple of flesh-—
eating Zombies are slowly coming toward them -- and Dana
grabs his arm, pulls him into the stone corridor and down
it.

And more carnage:

ANGLE: A CLOWN taking bullet hit after bullet hit as it
lumbers forward, knife in hand.

ANGLE: A WEREWOLF tearing out a man’s throat with its
teeth, as in the background a unicorn slams its horn
repeatedly into the guard up against a wall, blood
spurting on its lovely unicorn mane.

INT. CONTROL ROOM -— CONTINUOUS

The door is off its hinges, smoke filling the dark room.

Hadley has a submachine gun from a sliding drawer of
weapons under his console. He's looking down into the
Space and firing cover shots into the smoky room as
Sitterson is working the key-pad of a secure trapdoor
hidden under the carpet. Wendy Lin stands over him,
terrified.

Truman’s grenade explosion knocks Hadley off the edge and
into the main space, lost in the smoke.

LIN
Hadley!

SITTERSON
I’m close I’m close I'm close --

ANGLE: HADLEY is on his back, dazed, when he heara
something slurping toward him in the smoke. He looks to
see the MERMAN, black fin and dorsal like a whale, black
soaking hair, black eyes -- everything else as white as
his razor-sharp teeth. He puts a webbed hand on Hadley’s
throat as Hadley realizes he’s about to be killed by a
mexman --

HADLEY
Oh, come on!

And it bites his face off.

ANGLE: SITTERSGN AND LIN are concentrating on the
trapdoor, we hear a ‘ping’ --

SITTERSON
Got it!

Sitterson swings the heavy stone door up as a tentacle

wraps around Lin and whips her up out of frame.
Sitterson dives into the hole and pulls the door shut
over him.

INT. HIDDEN CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS
Sitterson races down a ladder and around the corner --
and right into Dana’s trowel. He looks at her, confused

by the blade in hig chest. She looks stricken,

He sees Marty coming up behind her, turns to her as he
sinks...

. SITTERSON
Please... kill him...

And dies at her feet, trowel still in him.

MARTY
Come on. We have to find a way out
before everything else finds a way in.

She's looking down at Sitterson.

MARTY (CONT'D)
Dana!

She looks up at him. He holds out the gun.

MARTY (CONT'D)
Here. It's easier with this.

She takes the gun and does seem to gain some measure of
calm from it. Starts down the hall -- and down a long
stone staircase, taking point, gun held out.

INT. THE CHAMBER — CONTINUOUS

Marty and Dana enter quickly, Dana holding the gun, the

camera circling them as they turn, looking at the five

stone slabs, then arming up to see they’re standing on a

mosaic of the aymbol Sitterson wore. ( 2

Except at the stairs, the @dges of the stone don’t reach
the wall. The two of them look over tha edge to sae a
space of maybe four feet across that goes all the way
down into darkness. But there is the sense of something
moving in that darkness. The kids draw back from it.

MARTY
No way out.

DANA
Look at these.
(turning slowly)
Five of them.

MARTY
What are they?

DANA
Us.

A whirring sound accompanies a spill of light as a small
circular hatch opens in the center of the mosaic and up
comes THE DIRECTOR (kind of like Luke in “Empire” when he
enters the cryogenic chamber to fight Vader.)

He is older, distinguished, wearing a black suit, grey
shirt, no collar, no tie, and grey gloves. He's calm, (
almost affectionate, .

That’s quite right.

DANA

I should’ve seen it like you did. all of
this: the old guy at the gas station, the
out of control behavior, the monsters...
this is part of a ritual.

THE DIRECTOR

 

The oldest.

MARTY
A ritual sacrifice? Great! You tie
someone to a stone, get a fancy dagger
and a buncha robes... it’s not that
complicated!

DANA
No, it’s simple. They don’t just wanna
see us killed, They want to gee us
punished.

MARTY
Punished for what?

THE DIRECTOR

For baing young? It’s different for
every culture. And it changes over the
years, but it’s very specific. There

MARTY
What happens if you don’t pull it off?

THE DIRECTOR

DANA
Who does? What's beneath us?

THE DIRECTOR
Tha gods. The Bleeping gods; the giants

it. They fought for a billion years and
now they sleep. In every gountry, for
every culture, there is a god to appease.
As long as one sleeps, they all do. But
the other rituals have all failed.

There is a great rumbling -- they all stagger a bit, and
silt sifts down from the ceiling. As it subsides...

THE DIRECTOR (CONT ’D)
The sun will rise in eight minutes.
(to Marty)
If you live to see it, the world will
end.

Neither of them questions the truth of it. They stare at
him a moment.

MARTY
Maybe that’s the way it ought to be.
Maybe it’s time for a change.

THE DIRECTOR
We’re not talking about change. We're
talking about the agonizing death of
every human soul on the Planet.

OQ,

Including you. You can die with them. or
you can die for them.

MARTY
Gosh, they’re both so enticing...

He looks over to Dana to see that she is pointing the gun
at hin.

MARTY (CONT'D)

Wow.
DANA
Marty... The whole world.. .
THE DIRECTOR
(to Dana)
There is no other way. You have to be
strong.
MARTY
Yeah, Dana. You feeling strong?
DANA,
I’m aorry.
MARTY
So am I.

A werewolf leapa at her from the stairs and tears into
her! The gun goes flying as she falls to the ground,
trying to pull the beast off her.

The Director and Marty both move for the gun, and
struggle themselves, but Marty finally gets hold of it --
knocking The Director to the floor -~ and without
hesitation puts three bullets into the werewolf, sending
it screeching back up the stairs.

Dana rolls over, eyes wild, blood everywhere. The
Director rises and tackles Marty. They wrestle on the
floor, the gun just out of reach, the edge of the abyss
by their heads.

As they fight, Dana breathes heavily by the stairs,
unable to rise. She looks over as two small feet shamble
by her, in old, dirty shoes, the edge of a tattered
gingham dress swinging above the ankles.

Marty gets on top of The Director and pushes his forearm
against his windpipe. His back is to the girl.

DANA
Marty...
 

 

 

The Director on top of him just as Patience swings her
hatchet, burying it in the back of the Director's skull.

Another tremor and Marty kicks The Director over the edge
of the circle. Patience, unwilling to let go her
hatchet, goes over with him.

Marty watches them a moment, then limps over to the
stairs,

Another, bigger tremor makes him pause, but it subsides
and he slumps in the corner next to Dana. She's
breathing shallow, tears streaming from her eyes, but
she's pretty alert.

MARTY
Hey.

DANA
You know... I don't think... Curt even
has a cousin.

MARTY
Huh. How are you?

DANA
Going away...

MARTY
I’m sorry.

DANA
I'm so sorry I almost shot you... 1
Probably wouldn't have...

MARTY
Hey, shh, no... I totally get it.

As he continues, he lights up a joint.

MARTY (CONT’D)
I’m sorry I let you get attacked by a
werewolf and then ended the world.

He takes a drag and holds it out to her. With a shakey
hand, she takes it and drags on it herself.

DANA
Nahh, you were right. Humanity...
(blows out smoke in a cynical
'Pfft’)
It's time to give Someone else a chance.

MARTY
Giant evil gods.

DANA
Wish I coulda seen ‘em.
MARTY
I know! That would be a fun weekend.

Biggest rumble yet. The floor starts bulging, eracking,
as dust and debris cloud the screen.

Dana holds out her hand. Marty puts his in it. Squeezes
it. They hold a moment.

An explosion of debris from below obliterates the
chamber.

EXT. CABIN - DAWN

We are wide on the cabin as a gnarled hand, bigger than

the house and on an arm a hundred feet long, shoots up
from the crust of the earth.
