"THE PARALLAX VIEW"

ExT. INTERSTATE HIGHWAY - NIGHT

It's RAINING hard. We look out through the wet side window
of a car parked on an overpass, above a long flat straight.
HEADLIGHTS of another car come toward us down the highway,
from total darkness, refracted by the trickling rain on the
window into a parallactic double image. ‘There's a BANG! like
a tire blowing. The lights swerve and skid, with a brief.
staggering CRASH of steel and glass pile head-on at 75mph
into cement abutment of the overpass. Then SILENCE settles
again, and OVER THE PICTURE these words appear:

"MAN'S IMAGE IS NOT ONLY THAT OF
GOb, IT IS ALSO THAT OF SATAN. . ~
THE IMAGE IN THE ASCENDANT NOW
CANNOT BE KNOWN TO US. PERHAPS
* GOD'S IS NOT THE TRIUMPH IN OUR
TIME. -
~-From The Handbook For
Emplovees, the Bureau
Of Social Structure."

EXT, BLACKTOP ROAD - Day -

A_ STATE POLICE CAR pursues a sedan at speed, siren and
flashers going. .Around a curve with tires screaming, then
the sedan brakes abruptly and pulls to a stop on the shoulder.

INT./EXT. STOPPED SEDAN

In the mirror the DRIVER watches TWO YOUNG TROOPERS getting

out of their car behind. He reaches out to his right,
unobtrusively unlatches the passenger-side door. Then he

gets a PISTOL from the glove compartment and slips it out

of sight under road map open on the seat beside him.

Sitting cool and eaSy, he watches the lst Trooper stop

back of his right rear fender. He pats his pockets, makes -
a sheepish show of searching for a wallet as the 2nd Trooper
comes on up to open window.

DRIVER
Wouldn't you know? I don't have
it on me. :

so 2nd TROOPER’
Step out, please.

Driver about to protest, but then he sees Trooper's hand go
down to holster. Driver pops his eyes in kind of scared
surprise, obediently fumbles at the door handle. That's his
last fumble. :

Like a steel spring he throws himself back flat on the seat
and with both feet kicks driver's-side door Savagely open
into gut of Trooper standing at it, and keeps on rolling
right out through unlatched door on other side, and lands
in a crouch with that gun in his hand and FIRES point-blank
at Trooper back of fender, and spins around in front and_
FIRES AGAIN at 2nd Trooper writhing windless on blacktop
where door slammed him. . :

Oh sweet hell. .

"PAST PULL BACK as he turns. ‘Now we see a STATE POLICE BUS

parked just beyond where sedan stopped. There are a DOZEN
ROOKIE TROOPERS standing in the road, watching in some awe.
The driver, who is LIEUTENANT FRADY, lowers his blank-
cartridge pistol fairly disgustedly.

. FRADY
Each of you. Write me five
reasons that would never happen
to you. That's all.

Prady shakes his head again at the Trooper still down on
the blacktop, steps over him and gets back into car.

INT. STOPPED SEDAN

Prady slams the doors and starts the engine and turns on
his radio. He picks up its microphone, blows in it.

He never shows much expression.

FRADY

INT. COUNTY HOSPITAL - LOBBY - DAY

ANDREW WINSTON gets out of an elevator. Well-dressed man in
youngish 50s. It won't surprise us when we learn he's a»
college professor. Winston is crossing to go out front doors
when he meets Frady coming in. They both stop.

They emerge from a stairwell. As Frady starts to lead
around a corner, Winston stops. CAMERA PANS to a sign on
the wall. It says "MORGUE" with a pointing arrow.

Stairway. Frady continues on his way.

An ATTENDANT sits at a desk outside double swinging doors.
He has a cold cigar butt in his mouth and is mentally jacking
off over an open Playboy mag. Frady comes up behind him.

parks his sedan in an official slot in front and goes

into the building. - . . .

INT. STATE POLICE HQ - DAY

As Frady walks along, a young UNIFORMED TROOPER passes
him in opposite direction, carrying some papers. He
makes funny knowing eyes at Frady and lets out a low
WHISTLE. Frady stops.

: FRADY

Harmon unstiffens and gets going quick. Frady turns a
corner. We can read lettering on the closed door at end
ahead of him: "CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION DIVISION. LT, FRADY.”
INT. FRADY'S OFFICE - DAY

Frady enters and stops short, like seeing a ghost.

ANOTHER ANGLE

A GIRL is standing by the window. Her name is HILDY. She's
in her early 30s and quite attractive enough to explain Cpl.
Harmon's whistle, and her attempt to hide her obvious uncer-
tainty isn't very good.

RILDY
Hello, Frady. Surprise.
CU = FRADY / ,
He just looks at her.- His eyes are strangely cold. Then

his eyes go off her as ANGLE LOOSENS. Making a point of
not looking at her, he hangs his jacket on a hook but

. heaves on his shoulder holster as he goes to desk and yanks

open a bottom drawer.

. FPRADY
How you get in here?

HILDY
Said I was engaged to you.

No look, no comment. Frady takes a bottle from the drawer.
Antique label says “Sloane's Horse Liniment," but it's
probably not that because he uncaps it and drinks a slug.

. ’ HILDY
I had a heck of a time finding
you. I never dreamed you'd be
a policeman.

Me neither.

HILDY

nod)

looks down again, continues shuffling papers. Hildy comes over
and leans toward him with her palms flat on the desk.

questioningly. Frady shuts the door in his face.

EXT. AUTO WRECKING YARD - DAY

Frady walks across a little way with the Yard Man. The four
wheel rims lie on the ground, stripped of tires. Frady
squats down by the pair of them which are knocked egg-shaped.

FRADY
These are the fronts, huh?
YARD MAN .
Yuh. What you lookin' to find :

PRADY

Dunno exackly.

Thanks. You can get back to work.

Yard Man gets the idea. He walks away. Prady turns the
wheels on the ground, studying the hollow inside of rims
where the tires used to be set. He pauses suddenly, with
narrowed eyes. :

CLOSER - WHEEL RIM :

There's a regular little indentation in one of them. A
small punched-in holiow in the steel, like could have been
made by a rifle bullet. fFrady sticks a forefinger in it.

shape matching the first, but there is no iittle hollowed
indentation in this one.

( INT. CAPITOL - A HEARING ROOM - DAY .
It's not a big one. A session is in progress: some sort of
House Appropriations Sub-Committee affair. There's a scat-
tering of PEOPLE in the seats, watching and listening.
EDWARD TRUMBULL sits in the witness seat. He's a very well-
tailored type in his 40s: they didn't break the mold after
they made Dean Acheson, evidently. Facing him over the big
paper-strewn table are SEVERAL CONGRESSMEN. The CHAIRMAN
is a small Southerner, string-tied and rimless-glassed. The
. pencils in front of him are very sharp, and we know from his
i eyes that he is a fierce guardian of the public purse.

CHAIRMAN
Correct me if I am in error, suh.
Your name is Edward Trumbull.
You are the Director of the Bureau
of Social Structure.

TRUMBULL ~
Yes, sir.

CHAIRMAN :
I presume you know the purpose of
this hearing, Mr. Trumbull?

Toe Yes, sir. To examine my bureau's -
request for funding in the coming
fiscal year.

nods, addresses himself again to the witness.

. CHAIRMAN
. Some of us aren't quite clear as

. Mr. Trumbull. Could you help us?

TRUMBULL
With pleasure, sir. The Bureau
of Social Structure was organized
in 1958, during the Eisenhower
administration, under PL 10451
dash 2. It is charged with -- I
quote -- the continuing study of
social structures as developed
within the United States as made-
by its.citizens in response to
conduct of the Federal Government.

No, suh. You will not.

TRUMBULL
I beg your pardon?

CHAIRMAN _ o™

Gentlemen, allow me to draw some
amazin' facts to your attention.
It's on that sheet you all have,

(as they look) ,
In each and every year since it
was started, this Bureau has
requested somewhat less money
than it received the year before.
Not only that, it has moved on
four occasions into smaller
quarters and operated with fewer :

. personnel. I find this record

usnique and without precedent
in my experience. Speaking for
myself, therefore, I don't give
a dang what this whatchamacallit
Bureau does -- just wish there
was more like it. All in favor?

 

THE COMMITTEE
Aye! .. :

: CHAIRMAN
Mr. Trumbull suh, your Bureau's
request for funding is approved
as made.

FULL SCREEN - PROJECTED SLIDE PHOTO

It packs a big wallop. It's a grainy enlargement of a POLITICAL
ASSASSINATION. It's no particular event that we can identify

in time or place but it has elements of all of them. The VICTIM
is turned away so we cannot see his face, but a piece of his
skull is obscurely detached and seems to be taking wing.

A FLASH of that, and a small o.s. CLICK SOUND, and we get _
ANOTHER SLIDE. Same event from a different angle, seen perhaps
three seconds later. The victim is falling now, though we
still NEVER SEE HIS FACE, and there is a fine spray that must
be blood, and the PEOPLE AROUND are now perceiving. Mouths
opened in existential terror as in Munch's painting of a scream.

Just a PLASH of that one too, and the o.s. CLICK and we get a
third slide. This one will remain a while. It shows same
unspeakable event from yet another angle. A group of SPECTATORS
watching from some distance. Setting might be a PUBLIC PARK.

The feature of it is this: perhaps TWENTY SPECTATORS in the
frozen shot, all but three of whom have had their faces CIRCLED
IN BLACK INK on the negative with VARIOUS DATES INKED ALONGSIDE.
Dates like 12/9/64 and 4/19/65 and so on. The THREE PEOPLE at
extreme right hand edge of slide are NOT CIRCLED AND DATED.
These are ONE MAN by himself, and a BLURRY COUPLE who seem to
have been holding hands as the photographer caught them.

Lo PRADY
-Assuming there is a “they.”

HILDY
Of course there is. And you
should be scared too. Because
if they're after me, now I've led
them to you.

FRADY :
I doubt it.

HILDY
How can you say that?

PRADY
You went to the police. No one
could guess you went to a policeman.
I'm a tree hid in the forest.

She comes closer to him, her eyes begging. :

- HILDY
I'm still scared, Frady. Please.

— I -- I don’t feel much like being

alone.

FRADY
Take a nice hot bath and chain the
door. Not to worry. I'll call you.

He's gone before she can Say 2 thing more. Alone, she does
look scared. She slips the door chain in its slot.

INT. CLAIRE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Frady sits alone under a lamp. He wears shorts only, sips
a drink as he broods over xeroxed notes he took from Hildy.
Low from RADIO comes a farm and commodity report. It gives
the time as something after 3 a.m. Frady puts the notes
down suddenly, eyes a telephone. .

He changes his mind. CAMERA WITH HIM as he crosses and looks
into bedroom. We glimpse Claire sprawled under sheet, sleep-
ing contentedly. Her dress. and things are scattered on the
floor. Stealthy, Frady goes in to get his own clothes, which
are laid out neat on a chair.

CU - A SILENT PORTABLE RADIO

It shimmers, and we realize it is UNDERWATER. The CAMERA-
PULLS UP a bit. Now we see that radio lies on bottom of

_ a bathtub, with its cord plugged into an outlet beside
washstand. Hildy Miller lies in the tub too, face down,
her hair floating on the surface like a funeral wreath.

Some small SOUND o.s. and ANGLE SHIFTS again. Frady appears
in bathroom doorway . NIGHT CLERK is behind him, with a pass-
key. The guy's pasty face comes unglued.

NIGHT CLERK
Holy mother.

INT, STATE POLICE HQ - ANOTHER OFFICE - DAY

This one belongs to CAPT. RINTELS. He reads a report as
Frady sits studying the rug. : :

RINTELS
You knew her. She's passing
through and calls you. Why you
look so guilty?

Well, I -- I walked out on her

fishing?

RINTELS
(instantly)
Request granted. Get lost.

EXT. MOUNTAIN COUNTRYSIDE - BY A RIVER - DAY :

The river runs through dark sweet. pines, joined here by a
smaller stream. The waters have carved a shelf into rocky
outrap, and under it is a wide black pool.

CAMERA finds Frady, in old clothes, lying at the end of

that shelf and gazing down. Swirl of water, a fish rising,
and as it jumps from the surface suddenly the SCREEN FLARES
ALMOST WHITE and over the residual image these words appear:

“NATURE IS THE PROPER TEACHER OF
MAN. IN THE LIFE CYCLE OF EACH
SEED AND ANIMAL ARE PRIZED LESSONS
IN AUTHORITY, COURAGE & DISCIPLINE.

-- cee --The Handbook, Bureau
Of Social Structure."

Words FADE OUT as key returns to normal. The fish is
vanished. Frady works himself back from the ledge.

EXT. ROAD NEARBY - DAY

Prady, in jacket and waders, stands at open trunk of car
parked on shoulder, setting up his fly rod. It is not
the police sedan he drove before. Frady looks down at a
map lying open in the trunk. We see it over his shoulder.
Highly detailed local job, with legend printed at top:
“IDAHO. NORTH FORK SALMONTAIL. SHEET 4." We may recog-
nize the confluence of river and side stream just seen.
Below it, an arrow has been marked in ink. Frady shuts
the trunk lid, walks toward the river with rod and creel.

No answer. Figure is so still we begin to doubt it, but.
then it moves and melts away into the trees. ~

Continues peering a bit, then turns back to river.
EXT. ROADSIDE MOTEL - EVENING

Rundown old place. Weatherbeaten cabins beside a frame -
house that serves as office too. Sign welcomes hunters

and fishermen, but no sign of anyone staying here, just

the owner's pickup parked by the house. Frady drives in

and gets out of car, still wearing his fishing jacket.

INT. MOTEL OFFICE - EVENING

It's just a desk area in front hall. Frady finishes fill-
ing out registration card as motel owner watches him. He
is HENRY PELIKAS. Seems a friendly soul, glad to have
someone to chat with in this obviously failing place.
Prady hands him registration card.

INT. FRADY'S CABIN - BATHROOM - EVENING

Frady stands at the mirror beside tin shower stall, a towel.
around his middle, giving himself a go-over with an electric
razor. Propped on little shelf in front of him is one of
those xerox sheets from Hildy's legacy. It's the same one
he looked at in her room. As Frady studies it again, we can
read the heading typed in caps. “ARTHUR FAVERSHAM. DROWNED
WHILE FISHING. SALMONTAIL RIVER, IDAHO.”

INT. PELIKAS KITCHEN - NIGHT

Nice and cozy. Frady and Pelikas sit at the table, with
bowls of stew and mugs of coffee. Pelikas can talk with
his mouth full or empty. se :

PELIKAS
Fishing's held up better, than the
hunting. Nowadays, you let go a
round in November, you're like to

lips, narrows eyes fairly theatrically.

EXT. RIVER - DAY

OPEN CU on one of those WARNING SIGNS Pelikas mentioned.
CAMERA PULLS to reveal the narrow gorge and four-foot
Niagara described last night. Frady is on a big jutting
slab at the side, above the little falls, casting down into
turquoise pool below. He has just reeled in when Pelikas
emerges from trees behind. He has a shotgun slung on his
back and carries a paper~sack.

. PELIKAS
How's the luck?

FRADY
all with the fish.

PELIKAS
Feel like eating, Jack, I brung
you up some lunch.

Hey -- that's very nice.

Coming in on the rock, catching the sack which Pelikas
tosses to him. He pulls out a sandwich.

PRADY
You give everyone this service,
Henry, you'll lose a --

Sudden BLAST OF SIREN from upstream. Frady spins. Its
loudness is really startling in this narrow gorge. Then
a GONG starts sounding, and they go together for a bit,
and then both DIE AWAY as startlingly as they began.
Prady takes a bite of his sandwich, staring. upstream
toward source of sound, in some awe. CAMERA IN on him.

PRADY
My God. No one could miss that.

PELIKAS
You'd think not.

PRADY
Now I really want to talk with
Meyer.

PELIKAS
There isn't any Meyer, you’know.

liverwurst and bread lying against his lower teeth as his

PELIKAS
Okay. Little more line out.

Frady drawing out line, lazily, and then suddenly it's like
with the rookie Troopers as he backhand-slashes rod over
Pelikas's eyes and dives at his ankles. Big BOOM! of shotgun
as Pelikas goes down, and now SIREN AND GONG start again, and
second barrel goes BOOM! and from upstream a SOUND LIKE SURF.
They grapple grunting, Frady's fingers still dug into ankle,
and then Frady is up on knees, yanking up as if at a lever.

PELIKAS AND THE RIVER ,

The man is poised a beat, limned against frothy wali of water
rushing down, crest boiling with small rocks and brush. Then
with a SCREAM, still clutching gun, he flips into the wave. -
Head bobs up, gets smashed hideously into rocks. One foot
in air, tumbling, and Pelikas has vanished.

ON FRADY

Watching the wild riverrun, its crest gone down the gorge.
Frady rises from hands and knees. He kicks the bag and
remains of sandwich into the drink, picks up rod and creel,
and walks away from the scene.

INT. PELIKAS HOUSE - DAY

Prady's over the desk in front hall. He pulls out all the
drawers and gives them a quick search... He finds nothing of
special interest. He turns and goes upstairs.

INT. UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - DAY

Frady stands a moment, getting the room's vibes. He's a

pro at this. He goes to bureau, pulls out the right top
drawer, pushes aside socks and stuff. There's a cheap
revolver under them. This Saturday Night Special neither
surprises nor interests Frady. He leaves it as it was,
crosses and throws mattress off the bed. Nothing under it.
The vibes draw him to a closet. He reaches up onto top shelf.
Behind a fur hat there's a FISHING BOX, like you keep flies

and things in. He takes it down. The box is locked. Frady

Frady gets the box open with a wrecking bar from rack on
wall. Top layer has little compartments filled with flies
and sinkers, etc. He swings that up on its metal arms.
Underneath is a helluva lot of U.S. currency. Frady shuts
box again, takes it into house through the connecting door.

INT. PELIKAS KITCHEN - DAY

Three stacks of bills on table: $20s, $50s and $100s. Prady
has jotted amounts in each denomination on a pad. MOVE IN
OVER SHOULDER as he does bit more arithmetic:

_ $52,500
- 29,820
$22,680

~

A beat, and then the pencil adds "2777."

“BACK TO FRADY

He frowns. Assuming Pelikas told truth about what he was
paid, and there's no reason to doubt it, almost half the
sum is not accounted for. Frady returns to beat-up fishing
box. Bottom part is empty all right: no savings account
passbook or bonds or anything. He's leaving the box again
when something catches at his eye. He reaches under a mess
of lead sinkers in top part, comes up with a folded bit of
NEWSPRINT. He unfolds it and stares at it and his eyes
narrow.

CU = THE NEWSPRINT

It's a medium-size box advertisement clipped from some news=
paper. We've all seen ones just like it. Big bold head
Says: "HIGH-PAID JOBS OVERSEAS!" ‘Then there's bit of print,
and another bold line: “YOU MIGHT QUALIFY!" A bit more print,
and then the bottom line that jumps out at you too: "APPLY

ciITy.*

ANGLE UP AT FRADY

Reading it and rereading ‘it, fascinated, as there is a SOUND
0.8. A CAR coming in and stopping. So great is Prady's
interest in this ad that he doesn't react until there's
another SOUND: the definite SLAM OF A CAR DOOR. He whirls
around and goes to front kitchen window.

likely he heard their dialog, He goes into the bathroom

In a crummy old place like this, it must take ten minutes

INT. FRADY'S CABIN - DAWN

TIGHT ON FRADY'S FACE as he sleeps in pale grey light. He
looks bleary and SNORES a little. From outside we hear a
COCK CROW. Frady reflexly licks dry lips with dry tongue,
stirs as if to turn head on pillow. But something seems
to restrain the motion. His eyes open vaguely. Suddenly
they're wide and not vague at all.

CAMERA DROPS DOWN a bit. There's a BIG PAIR OF SCISSORS
held partly open at his throat, the points precisely at
both sides of his Adam's apple.

MARIAN (VO)
Now don't you move. Don't you
move at all! : :

CUTS - MARIAN AND THE SCISSORS

She leans against his throat. Her hand trembles. We feel
she is pushing the steel with all her force, but some obscure
counterforce is obstructing her. Trémbling gets worse. She

pespises her own weakness so much that tears suddenly fill
er eyes. :

: MARIAN
Bastard!!

LOW ANGLE - UP AT MARIAN

She lifts scissors, stabs them down flashing PAST THE CAMERA.
Again and again, fiercely, and then we see some little bits
ef goose-down fluff flying up.

ANOTHER ANGLE

It's only the pillow she has murdered. Choking, Marian
throws herself down on the foot of the bed.

Frady gets up. He detaches the scissors from her hand.
There's a nearly empty bottle of Scotch on the dresser. He
takes a snort, then pours a slug into a tumbler. He puts

it in Marian's hand: She doesn't seem aware much of anything.
Frady reacts to an abrupt SOUND outside: it might be a couple
of piled crates falling over. He crosses quickly, peers out
the small curtained window. .

EXT. DENVER - HOTEL WELLINGTON - DAY

Big old commercial pile. Frady gets out of a taxi in front.
He's wearing a jacket and tie. As he pays the driver and
waits for change, the SCREEN FLARES LIGHT as it has before
and over image THESE WORDS appear:

“(THE PRIME OBJECTIVE OF ANY STATE
IS TO INSURE ITS OWN CONTINUANCE
AND THE SURVIVAL OF ITS CITIZENS
IN A JUST AND ORDERLY MANNER. BUT
IT IS THE STATE'S RIGHT: TO MANAGE
THIS BY WHATEVER MEANS MAY OFFER

INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY

It's fairly seedy, haunted by the ghosts of many dead drummers.
Frady enters via revolving doors. His eyes ‘take in everything:
potted plants and PEOPLE loafing and all that. There seems
nothing very remarkable. He crosses to the desk.

AT THE DESK - CLOSER

Frady produces a box advertisement torn from a paper. We
glimpse it as he puts it on the counter. The ad is identical
in format to one found at Pelikas's place. Big top line say~
ing "HIGH-PAID JOBS OVERSEAS!" and a middle line saying "YOU
MIGHT QUALIFY!" No need to read new bottom line, telling
where and when to apply.

FRADY
Howdy. Looking for Suite 524.

DESK MAN
(giving him a card)
Write your last name in the box.

OVER FRADY'S SHOULDER ,

It's an ordinary computer card, blank except for a big pre-
printed MAGNETIC NUMBER and little boxes in which to fill in
the letters of your name. . Number on this card happens to be
19 141 6. Frady takes a pen from holder on counter and starts
printing his last name.

PRADY

Any idea what kind of jobs being
offered?
DESK MAN

Nope. I just work here, friend.

FRADY
Pretty funny. You'd think they'd
give & hint anyway. .

DESK MAN
Work in this trap long's I done,
you'd never think anything.
(when Frady offers
him finished card)
fake it with you. Fifth floor.
Read this on the way.

’ :

Pulls printed sheet from under desk, slaps it down on top.
Monster red-printed words jump from the top: "WELCOME,
APPLICANTS! READ YOUR INSTRUCTIONS!"

i

 
61.

MOVING WITH FRADY

He takes the sheet and leaves the desk. He reads it as he
walks toward the elevators. He gets into one and goes up

to the fifth floor, during which we hear a VOICE OVER giving
the instructions from the shect, while Frady's reading it
himself. Though we don't have to recognize it now, this

_ voice is Dr. Malinowski's. Certain words are stressed

unnaturally heavily, as the caps indicate:

VOICE OVER
You are about to be TESTED for
JOB SUITABILITY. The test begins
the moment you enter the PARALLAX
SUITE. If YOUR test is to have
value, VALUE, if it is to measure
YOUR capabilities, you must follow
INSTRUCTIONS as exactly, EXACTLY,
as possible. SAY NOTHING or DO
NOTHING that you are not DIRECTED : ~
to SAY or DO. Here is an EXAMPLE.
You now hold a CARD. It bears
YOUR NAME and-a SIX DIGIT NUMERAL.
When and IF you are selected to
proceed from the INTRODUCTORY
Parallax Suite to an INDIVIDUAL
TEST AREA, you must respond to
that DIRECTION with the first
INITIAL of your LAST name plus
the FIRST FIVE digits of the
numeral which follows. If the .
numeral after YOUR name were
printed as, for EXAMPLE, 1-3 space
8-7-6 space 4, you would respond
with your INITIAL plus 1-3-8-7-6. -
Note that in this context the
printed SPACES would NOT be
AUDIBLY VOCALIZED. Vocalization
of the SPACES would be an ERROR.
Errors cost POINTS. Errors will
cause MANY of you to FAIL. Those
who FAIL cannot be considered
for a HIGH-PAID JOB OVERSEAS.
To repeat, REPEAT, you must SAY
NOTHING or DO NOTHING that you
are not DIRECTED to SAY OR DO.
fhe Parallax Corporation is a
nationally recognized testing
institute which conducts tests
for MANY gf America's LEADING
MANUFACTURERS and ORGANIZATIONS.
To each of you -~ GOOD LUCK.

Frady has finished reading this. He is out of the elevator
now on the fifth floor, going down a shabby hall, eyeing”
room numbers. He reaches 524. There's a sign hung on it.
"THE PARALLAX CORPORATION. KNOCK TWICE & ENTER.“ Frady
looks again at the instruction sheet. He folds it and puts
it away in a pocket and knocks twice and goes in.

INT. SUITE ANTEROOM - ON FRADY

He stops short, just inside. ANGLE to HIS P.O.V. On a bench
in this small bare space sits a WOMAN quietly sobbing.

Around one sleeved forearm she tightly grips a handkerchief.
It's sopping red and blood is dripping from underneath it.
Her eyes are terrified and huge with appeal.

FRADY
He looks up and around. Gaze holds on something. ~
CU - WHAT HE SEES

Somewhat hidden in fake flowers of a high-hung fixture is the
eye of a little TV camera, aimed down.

BACK TO SCENE

Frady understands. Another DOUBLE KNOCK and the outer door
opens. Another APPLICANT enters, holding his card.

- APPLICANT
Christ almighty!

Prady says nothing and does nothing. He continues on through
inner door.

INT. PARALLAX SUITE - DAY

Maybe FIFTEEN APPLICANTS hang around in odd silence. They
vary from oilfield types to accountants to dowdy secretaries.
At the end is a bar and a loaded buffet, and an ACCORDIONIST
sits on a gilt chair playing loud polkas. A HOSTESS comes up
to Frady. She has a plastic badge saying "Parallax Corp.”
with photo underneath, pinned to her blouse. She smiles
nicely. : :
“ HOSTESS
Welcome.

That isn’t a direction; so Frady doesn't respond. He looks
around for more TV eyes. Hostess isn't offended.

FPrady heads obediently for bar and buffet.
AT THE BAR
Behind it in a white jacket is young Willy of the BSS.

WILLY
Spot o' redeye, pard?

: . PRADY
Jack D. and water.

WILLY
si, sefor. : ~

Prady does a little take and glances at Willy again. Willy
just used a line he must've picked up from the bartender in
"Black Bart's Saloon" at the OK Corral. Frady brushed Willy
for a moment in the lobby there. His memory is trying to
tell him something, but Frady doesn't know what.

INT. HOTEL - ANOTHER ROOM

It has the same awful wallpaper. There are a lot of wires
lying around, running up and out through a side transom.
They lead to a few closed-circuit TV SCREENS set up on the
dresser. Watching these are Trumbull and Dr. Malinowski.

TRUMBULL
What's your impression?

DR. MALINOWSKI
An average group.

TRUMBULL
Let's pray somewhat above.
(getting just a grunt)
I mean we're looking for someone
te dispatch a policeman. It could
be sticky.

DR. MALINOWSKI
I have plotted many policemen on
my curves. I have never found
them to be exceptional.

Now MOVE CLOSER on one TV monitor. We're looking down at
Frady, contemplating the buffet. ~

TRUMBULL
I rather like the way this fella
walks. Let's follow him and see
what he eats.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY

Roughneck Applicant who entered anteroom just after Frady
is down at the front desk now, much agitated.

APPLICANT
I tellya, there's a dame bleedin’
up there! Where's the house dick?

Desk Man picks up phone in a long suffering manner. x

DESK MAN ‘
Mr. Ellison? Front, please.

Suddenly the agitated fellow sees something o.s. It staggers
him, ANGLE SHIFTS. The Woman from anteroom is emerging from
elevator, unwrapping a candy par. All sign of the clearly
fake wound has disappeared.

APPLICANT
Forget the house dick! Where's
the bar??

FRADY - AT BUFFET

He's making a sandwich. He puts smoked salmon on a slab of
rye, spreads it with strawberry jam. Then.he adds mustard
and peanut butter and dots the top with olives and whipped
cream. .

TRUMBULL AND MALINOWSKI
They're watching same on monitor. Trumbull is awed.

TRUMBULL
What was the direction? Make an
"interesting sandwich"?

DR. MALINOWSKI
Yes. . He does appear to have a
certain ingenuity. foo

TRUMBULL
Damme if I don't like this one a
whole lot. Cross your fingers!

Trumbull quickly leaves the monitor. Finds a wire and pushes
a call-button at the end of it.

ON PRADY - AT BUFFET :
He bites his sandwich. Behind him, from apparent nowhere, a
cute little KITTEN suddenly hops onto the table. It says
miaou. Frady turns. He gives it a scrap of smoked salmon.
Then Willy moves in, holding a vodka bottle by the neck. He
whams it down, breaking the kitten's back. He picks it up
by the tail and clubs it savagely again and throws it into
his barside slop pail.

FLASH CUTS - THE ROOM

Plenty of people have seen this. Their faces are just like
yours would be. The Accordionist keeps on playing. ~~

FEATURING WILLY

He wipes his hands daintily with a rag. A LITTLE MAN who
looks like a ribbon clerk rushes up, quivering.

So. LITTLE MAN
- You stinking bastard.

WILLY
Cats carry germs.

The Little Man punches Willy in the mouth. Willy slugs him
back. . .

cU = FRADY

He takes another bite of his sandwich. He doesn't say any-
thing or do anything.

TRUMBULL AND MALINOWSKI

They're glued to the monitor. Even the skeptical doc appears
impressed.

DR. MALINOWSKI
Certainly no Bambi Syndrome.

TRUMBULL"
“Let's get inside his head.

Malinowski nods. Trumbull hurries to a telephone.
&

 

66.

ANGLE ON FRADY

He stands by the window, carefully looking out. He takes a
small controlled sip of his drink. The Hostess comes up to

HOSTESS
Could I see your card, please?

That was a question, not a direction. Frady doesn't move.

HOSTESS
Give me your card.
(he does, at once,
and she looks at
printed number)
Follow me to a Test Room. .

FRADY
F19141. .

That's the right answer. She starts to move and Frady follows.

INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR

Hostess leads Frady to a room door a little way down from
reception suite. She sticks a key in the lock.

HOSTESS
Seat yourself at once.

She opens door. - He goes in. She closes door again.”

INT. TEST ROOM

It's lit by a single dim bulb. Black cloth has been tacked
over the window. Only furniture is a metal desk and chair
in exact center. On it is a box with a row of buttons
numbered 1 through 5. Also another metal box with a binecu-
lar eyepiece in the front and a chin-rest below. Set up
behind the desk, facing the chair, is a big translucent
rear-projection viewing screen, set in what looks like a
monstrously enlarged TV console.

Frady seats himself at once. He is obviously being observed
by a closed-circuit eye somewhere, for he is no sooner sat
down than the overhead bulb goes out. fhe numbered buttons
glow. An image appears on the screen. Two HUGE CLOCK FACES.
One shows the time of day. The other is a stopwatch affair
with a sweep hand which makes a full jerky revolution every
five seconds. Dr..Malinowski's VOICE comes from speakers:

VOICE
Time is of the ESSENCE! You are

You must ANSWER ALL QUESTIONS,

corresponding to your CHOICE.
You must allow NOTHING to DISTRACT

Now a multiple-choice question flashes on the screen in huge
letters:

THE SOLDIERS RETREATED LIKE...
(1) Dogs (2) Rabbits (3) Rats -

It flashes off as Frady hits Button Two, is instantly replaced
by another. .
YESTERDAY WAS...
(1) Beautiful (2) Over @) Cold
(4) .Dead (5) Tomorrow

Sudden STARTLING SOUNDS come from hidden speakers all around
the room. The whine of a falling bomb, then an explosion
that almost knocks Frady out of his skull, people shrieking.
They continue, worse than merely distracting, on different
tracks: people arguing, and Spiro Agnew delivering a speech,
and fire engine sirens and children crying and someone read-
ing a sex manual, all mixed up together as questions follow
each other on the screen:

INT. TRUMBULL'S HOTEL ROOM

Dr. Malinowski is seated at a table, intently watching
continuing test results being printed out by some kind of
interesting gadget. He makes quick calculations on a slide
rule, jots figures down on charts spread out in front of
him. Trumbull hovers around, nibbling on a chocolate eclair,.
He watches over the savant's shoulder, casts an occasional
eye on audio and videotape players whose reels are silently
turning in the b.g. The door opens. Willy comes in, in his
bartender's jacket.

WILLY
Got a live one, huh?
. TRUMBULL
Affirmative.
WILLY
Party's growing a bit wet. . ~
TRUMBULL :

Fold it up. Give ‘em the usual

trash to fill in and mail.
Willy crosses to TV monitors. On one we see Frady's dim-lit
face, screwed up in concentration as he eyes screen and jabs
answer buttons.

’ WILLY
I wasn't thrilled with how this
chap looked at me.

- . TRUMBULL
How did he look at you?

WILLY
Like he knew me from somewhere.
(getting no reply)
Okay. I'll go 86 the festivity.
. ‘TRUMBULL

Double-check the caterers, Willy.
Be damn sure they credit us for
what's left. Oh, and you might
save me a few eclairs... They're
not bad, for the provinces.

BACK TO TEST ROOM

Frady's battered by continuing cacophony of SOUNDS, barely
holding onto his wits as questions flash on the screen:

Velvet blackness, with a glow in the center.

Do you SEE this tiny LIGHT?

Hunched at box, chin on the rest, eyes at eyepieces, adjusting
focus. The Voice suddenly booms real big:

against eyepieces.

And we have seen it. Vibrantly ‘colored letters have appeared
at both lower corners: “P-I-S" at one side, "O-O-N" at other.
They rise as if over an elevation at an immense distance, then
rush toward us to combine into a single huge word "POISON"
which then blows up almost instantly into sparky points of
fire.

. VOICE
When you can READ the word, you
will give, ANNOUNCE, the word
that you ASSOCIATE with it. You
will announce ONE WORD only.
The word “POISON” was a PRACTICE

PRACTICE words, only TEST words.

iN THE VIEWER

The point of light suffuses into a glow which becomes in turn
an image full of violent color. Shadings and convoluted
shapes, solarized, changing constantly. They begin rather
like the nastiest blots of Rorschach set, and proceed from
there into hints of happenings of mind-blowing disgustingness
and horror. - :

willy nods and exits. Trumbull stuffs down his last morsel
of apple pie. He rises and looks at Frady on the TV monitor.
Frady hasn't moved. Trumbull opens a bureau drawer and gets
out an attaché case.

INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Trumbull comes down it, with the case. He stops at a room
door. Listens a moment. Then he gets out a wey and slips
it in the lock and opens the door.

INTO THE ROOM - TRUMBULL'S P.O.V.

Prady's already on one elbow on the bed, looking this way,
his free hand slipped under his pillow.

TRUMBULL - IN THE DOORWAY

TRUMBULL
Yours was excellent.

Trumbull walks over and lifts the pillow. Under it, not

just was.

You fascinate me. I presume
you've had extensive dealings
with the law.

Frady looks surprised. He lowers himself into a ratty
armchair. Trumbull solemnly places the attaché case on
Frady's knees and opens lid. Frady's eyes bug out.

MIX from the last. It's soon after dawn. Frady sits again,
this time by the base of a statue: Lewis and Clark, or the
like. ‘There are pigeons around, but no one else. Frady
takes his badge out and looks at, it. It doesn't give much
comfort. He puts it away again. He looks at his watch.
Dredging a fistful of change from his pocket, Frady rises
and walks to an outdoor phone booth nearby.

INT. PROFESSOR WINSTON'S BEDROOM

He's sleeping when PHONE RINGS. Now SCREEN SPLITS to include
Prady in phone booth, in narrow panel at one side. Winston

PHONE RINGING here too now. Claire's asleep, naked under a
rumpled sheet. She wakes just enough to pick up receiver
blearily. Again SCREEN SPLITS to include Frady in the

A MAN with just a towel wrapped around his middle comes from
the bathroom, drinking alky-seltzer. It isn't Harmon, just
some good-looking type Claire picked up in the bar.

THE MAN
Who in hell you gabbing with this
hour, sweetie?

Frady has heard a man's voice.

FRADY
Clear out! I'm not kiddin'!

Frady's turn to hang up hard. WIPE CLAIRE'S PANEL. He leaves
the booth, terribly depressed. SOUNDS of some helicopter
clattering over the park, fast and low. Frady gives it a
brief automatic glance, then walks on with his head low and
his hands in his pockets.

Willy sprints for parking area in b.g.
INT. HOTEL WELLINGTON - DINING ROOM - MORNING

A cavernous dreary place. Trumbull is breakfasting alone,
with a newspaper folded open to stock market listings. He
pokes a fork sourly into a very overdone poached egg. He's
looking around for a Waitress when he sees Willy coming in
fast. Willy makes a beeline for Trumbull's table and sits
right down. .

: Your manner is full of portent.

EXT. CITY STREET ~ DAY

Taxi pulls up in front of a restaurant. The marquee says

‘*ba Jardiniere." Frady hops out. He looks up and down

street both ways, then goes toward the door.

INT. RESTAURANT - ENTERING WITH FRADY

We see it through his eyes: almost total darkness at first,
after bright sunlight. He gropes in, bumps against the
shadowy figure of a WOMAN just inside.

: FRADY
Scuse me.

Mais certainement, m'sieu.

She steadies him with a hand, steps back. The scene grows
clearer as his eyes accommodate. The place is dim and

linger behind banquettes. He registers each face but resog-
nizes none. He continues on through door to garden at the

_end. There's a HIGH-KEY DAZZLE before his eyes re-accommodate

to sunlight.

EXT. GARDEN PATIO - DAY

- It's a pleasant place enclosed by a brick wall. There are

potted trees and shrubbery. ‘Trumbull is by himself at a
table toward the far wall. ‘He stands up with a drink in his
hand, the picture of a charming host.

TRUMBULL ,

TRUMBULL
Why? I love it too, Lieutenant.
This America, this great nation.
Godawful in many ways. Reeks of ~
violence, keeps slave populations
crammed in vile ghettos from coast
to coast. Hypocritical and unjust,
tasteless, overbuilt and under-
developed, can elect a Richard
Nixon. But. It's the last best
hope of the world. What's wrong
with America can possibly be
changed. Provided its existence
is preserved. We must manage its
suryival -- manage it.
(and no doubt he
“means all this)
The great threat to survival is
our pattern of native violence.
True, we got along with it for
two centuries. We had buffalo
to slaughter, and Indians and
blacks and gooks. But those
outlets are no longer permissible.
They are acceptable only to
contemptible maniacs. So how
will we live with our inbred
violence for the next century?
Or fifty years or even ten --

FEATURING TRUMBULL Fete”

: TRUMBULL

I don't care what their source
is. A lone madman with a Spanish
rifle, a handful of activists,
outraged black men, frightened
rich people on the hill -- each
presses on the other's living
space, on his beliefs, on his -
sacred miniscule possessions.
And his sense that no one cares. ~

(pause)
Get a rifle, get a pistol, get a
club, something with knots in the
end that will break a skull. Save
bottles. Fill them with low-lead
gas and stuff a rag in and throw
it. Make a bomb. Keep it handy.
You never know what's coming.
You'll see the nameless THEY coming
down your street one day, one
evening in the spring. Then what
will you do? Maybe they'll be all oy
black with beards and a crazy red
light in their eyes. Maybe they're
white, brutish, and big and tough
and bald with shotguns and automatic
weapons -- and uniforms. How do
you dissipate that pattern?

That's what my Bureau is for. We
were funded as a group to look for
ways to channel sociological
upheavals into coherent patterns,
and find ways to ease them.

to be checking house number against a slip of paper. Eyes

Another car parked diagonally across street, its hood up,

toward where that sound came from.

IN THE KITCHEN \
Todd must have been listening. He's grabbed up a big carving
knife, is waiting with it as his mother and Frady come through
the swinging door. He lunges and nicks Frady's arm, but Frady
is twisting already and backhands the kid, knocking him flat
on his ass. Marian makes whimpering noises. The TV set sings
that life is great with a Coke. Frady flips out his badge.

Gould has the door of Frady's car open. He's holding a metal
box about the size of a cigarette carton. He twists a little

_ timer-knob on the end, slips the box under the driver's seat.
As he's closing the car door there's a big muffled BOOM!
BOOM! from inside house. It seems to surprise him a little.
He steps back into the street. Frady appears at living room
window. He looks directly out at Gould and jerks his head.
Gould hesitates. Then he slips a hand in a side pocket and
heads for the front door.

INT. MARIAN'S HOUSE

Frady opens the door. Gould slides in. Frady closes the
door and slams Gould with his gun. Gould tumbles and Frady's
right on top of him on his knees, smashing his head again and
again with pistol butt.

TIGHT LOW ANGLE - UP AT FRADY

' He's seriously berserk, flailing with his revolver and yelling
like he did at the late Dr. Malinowski.

PRADY
Sonofabitch! It was YOUR ZOMBIES
ALL THE WAY! Wasn't it, WASN'T IT??

He's not going to get any answer. The man's skull has been
cracked in any number of places. Frady stops in midswing.
He shivers. Perhaps it's occurring to him that he does
belong with Trumbull's murderous Bureau. He shivers again
at the o.s. sight of what he has just done and stands up.

ANOTHER ANGLE
Marian has appeared in be. g. and is just staring.

FRADY
That was the last easy one. You
got anything I could drink?

She disappears back into kitchen like she didn't hear. Frady
bends and slips an automatic from Gould's side pocket, drops
it into his own. He's still holding his revolver by the
barrel. He notices foreign matter on the butt. He goes and
wipes it on a drape. .

EXT./INT. GARAGE IN BACK - TWILIGHT

Marian's wagon'is in it. She stumbles out through the con-
necting door from house, ahead of Frady, who carries Todd.

He pitches kid into back seat. Marian still seems in a daze,
so he pushes her in after and slams the door and jumps in
himself behind the wheel. Frady starts the engine and backs
out fast. :

CLOSER ANGLE - IN THE STREET

Frady jams on the brakes and pushes backwards, trying to
slide driver's seat backward on its tracks. It will only
go a bit, then jams. He pushes open his door and fumbles
at the seat catch. CAMERA DROPS. We see his fingers brush
around the end of another metallic box under the seat,
gzactly like the one we saw Gould slip into his own car in
ont. :

IN SIDE-VIEW MIRROR

What could be the shadowy figure of a MAN is seen to step
back behind a tree. PAN to Frady. He's looking in the
mirror, seeing this, and he's not going to worry about his
seat position any more just now. He pulls the door shut
and spins the wheel and guns off down the street. .

ANOTHER SHOT - SAME STREET

It was a man behind that tree. He steps out. We may recog-
nize him: he's the fellow who picked up Claire and was with
her when Frady phoned that early morning. If we fail to
recognize him, no matter. He walks quickly to a car parked
in driveway, engine idling. Behind its wheel is Willy.
Fellow jumps in and they take off.

INT. MARIAN'S WAGON - MOVING - NIGHT

Frady makes time down a four-lane highway. There are head-

Prady swings off the four-laner onto a dark farm road. The
ma wagon has rotten suspension, but FPrady's a pro at this.
Willy has a good foot too. He keeps up through skids and
“ things, but finally he spins oct somewhere. It doesn't
smash Willy's car, just stalls it and makes Willy say "Oh

EXT./INT. MARIAN'S WAGON

FPrady rounds a curve at speed, one eye locked on the now-
dark rear-view mirror. It's late when he sees what is

dead ahead: lowered gate of a RAILWAY GRADE CROSSING, with

a DIM RED LIGHT flashing and swinging as a LONG SLOW FREIGHT
lumbers through.

FLASH CUTS

Prady tries to floor the brake, but with the seat way forward
that way his knee snags the dash and he misses the pedal,

and Marian jumps up in back and screams, and Frady kicks
again and yanks at hand brake and spins the wheel all at
once, and the wagon slews around to a crazy crash stop.

ANGLE - STOPPED WAGON

Its behind is right through the guard gate, about a yard
from:the clattering train. Marian has been pitched forward
into the front seat. Frady jumps out, his knees watery with
relief and anger. Damn stuck seat almost killed him. He
ducks down, slamming at the seat catch, trying to see and
feel what's jamming the track underneath. He sees. PUSH IN
TIGHT as he freezes for a split second and then shouts:

. . FRADY
GET OUT!!

OVERHEAD SHOT

Frady leaps up and yanks open back door, hauls at Tedd.
dust as he gets him out there's an EXPLOSION from under the
ariver's seat, a blasting flash that sends Frady and Todd
backward through the air.

DOWN THE ROAD A PIECE

Willy's car coasts to a stop on the shoulder with no lights.
He and the Other Killer get out.. Moonlight glints on their
+357 magnum revolvers.

ON FRADY

He's stunned in a ditch. He stumbles up and runs to the
wagon. It's not burning but one look is enough. The whole
front-seat section has been blown totally to hell. It went
off right under Marian. He goes back to whare he picked
himself up from.

ANGLING ON TODD . ,

Kid lies sprawled beside same ditch. Blown-off car door is
partly over him. It looks to have gashed and broken one leg

FRADY

Where's Mom?

Sudden BLAZE OF LIGHT on Frady and the BWAAAANG! of a ricochet.
A shiny new gash has appeared in the blown-off door panel.
Frady rolls Todd into the ditch and dives in after him, whip-
ping revolver from its holster. :

OVER FRADY'S SHOULDER - DOWN THE ROAD L -

The HEADLIGHTS of Willy's car are. on him blindingly. BANG!
and BANG! and Frady has shot them both out. A beat of nothing
and then a figure pops up from ditch and FIRES at him, and as
Frady FIRES ONCE back.it is-gone and another figure pops up
from ditch on the other side and FIRES too and also instantly
is gone. They're like tin figures in a mechanical shooting
gallery. - :

BACK TO FRADY Ds

He's poised with “finger on trigger, then thinks of something.
Flips out cylinder of his revolver. His thought was correct:
two bullets blown inside Marian's house, another three just
now. That leaves him here in a ditch with a badly hurt kid
and exactly ONE BULLET left, and he isn't packing ammo. The
situation is not wholly promising. He turns his head to look
behind him. :

The train is still crashing noisily through the grade cross~-

dragging him toward the pipe. Todd's busted leg is no
help at all. .

Door is partly open on the side away from the action. By
moonlight we see Frady bent over Todd, who lies on a pile
of -dusty old mail sacks. Compressed air hisses 0.S. as
brake shoes relax from rims, Frady feels the boy's leg
where trouser is blood-soaked. He starts a sharp cry, but

Big jerk as the coupling slack is taken up and the ‘exain
starts to move.

EXT. TRAIN

Much crashing noise as it gets going. At last moment Willy
and his mate come running up low and clamber onto coupling
platform at rear of old railway mail car.

INT. MAIL CAR - MOVING TRAIN

Frady has made a tourniquet from strip of shirt, has it
twisted around Todd's thigh above the wound. The boy looks
poorly: face is filmed with sweat and breath is shallow.

He moans at the car's constant jolts.

EXT. COUPLING PLATFORM - MOVING TRAIN

The heavy steel door into mail car is locked. Willy puts
his magnum muzzle close to it and FIRES. Door is still
locked. They made them tough in those days. He aims to
shoot again.

INT. MAIL CAR - FRADY

He kneels holding the tourniquet, looking at his wristwatch.
Another BANG! from outside. We can distinguish it from

train noisé, but Frady doesn't. BANG! again. A couple of
beats, then Frady suddenly swivels his head in delayed reaction.

Door at the end. Same kind of BANG! again and chips of ancient
paint fly off the inner surface.

Willy and his mate FIRE TOGETHER. Lock area looks like it's

The lock has been smashed. It is going to open now. But he's
careful. He takes clip from his gun and-rams in a new one.

“ Ditto his friend. Willy says something into his ear which we
can't hear over noise, but from their new positions the idea
is clear: Willy will go in now while the Other Killer covers
him from the coupling platform.

INT. MAIL CAR - ANGLE ON DOOR

It opens abruptly and Willy steps in with gun leveled. TILT
UP QUICK. Frady is up above on iron ladder attached to end
bulkhead, holding a mail sack. Frady leaps down, holding
the sack open and inverted. .

QUICK ANGLES - THE ACTION

It's unbelievably fast. The sack whomps down over Willy's
head and shoulders and Frady knees. him in the crotch and
slams him back into the steel wall and knees him again on
the bounce and has snatched the pistol from his hand and_
dropped to one knee and spun around.

 

The Other Killer is just rushing in. BOOM! and his shot
goes over Frady's head and BOOM! Frady's return shot goes
into the guy's nose and he goes cartwheeling backwards into
the clattering night, dead before he'll hit the crossties.
Frady turns again. oo

INCLUDE WILLY , -

He's on his haunches at base of side wall, stunned and

retching under his canvas straitjacket. Stenciling on it

says "U.S. Government Property." As Willy scrabbles at .
bottom edge, Frady keeps the gun right on him and moves
backward, back to where Todd lies. With his left hand, -
Frady gropes and finds the tourniquet and twists it tight
again. Willy finally gets the sack up off his head. His

own gun looks at him and Prady suddenly and at last remembers.

Past Frady in silhouette against the partly open door of the

Age!

FRADY
I'm kind of busy. Old traffic
tickets and stuff, you know?

v Really, sir, I beg you urgently.
. Let us go into your office.
it's essential!

Go. ce There's a crazy glint in Trumbull's eyes. Frady is getting
~ to him. Frady yawns and scratches an armpit.

FRADY
Screw it. I think he's a phony
two-bit creep. Throw him out
and lift your leg on him --

ON TRUMBULL .

He can't believe it. This nobody jerkwater cop has raped
~ ° his very essence, is actually turning his back on Edward
. Trumbull. It unglues him completely. With inutterable fury,
‘ Trumbull takes a step backward and whips out a little nickel-
: plated revolver.

REVERSE ANGLE

It happens quicker than it can be described. Trooper Johnson
screams "Watch out!!" and leaps up pulling his own revolver,
but something like this was just wnat Frady hoped would happen,
and he yells "Nol!!!" at the Trooper and backhands him, and
goes in a twisting dive at Trumbull, and Trumbull's little
__— gun says BANG! and .at same instant there's a really cannonlike
- BOOM! BOOM! BCOM! °-

120.

TOWARD TRUMBULL

He doubles forward with a look of sheer astonishment. It's
so staged that for an instant he looks absolutely identical
to famed frozen picture of Lee Harvey Oswald getting gut-shot
by Jack Ruby. With dying amazement, Trumbull folds and
crashes to the floor beneath Frady.

CAMERA CRANES UP FAST. There's a GUY in civvies at the side,
who must've just walked in. He holds a smoking revolver.

It was he who put the blast on Trumbull. An astonished moment.
Frady's head and ours still ring with the stunning reverbera-
tion of those four fast shots in this enclosed space.

The Guy lowers his revolver. Almost lazily, he hauls a leather
folder from his hip pocket and flips it open. A small gold
badge gleams inside.
. THE GUY
(southern drawl)
Officuh Ellinsworth, ah'm from
New O'leans. Come up to see you
all ‘bout a fugitive. Ain't it
mighty lucky?

,

‘Frady still looks uncomprehending. ‘There's blood coming from

his shoulder where Trumbull's snap-shot winged him in midaizx.
He rolls Trumbull over. The eyes are glazed and open and

dead. The tongue will never wag again. In b.g. other TROOPERS
are rushing in with drawn revolvers.

TIGHT CU - FRADY

“Something goes off violently inside his brain. He looks up
‘again o.s. :

FRADY AND THE COP FROM NEW ORLEANS

Frady recognizes'him. He was behind one of those banquettes
in “La Jardiniere." Lt. Prady stares into the man's face

and sees a labyrinth of dark tunnels stretching into infinity
ahead of him.

PRADY
Oh sweet hell.
FREEZE on that.
