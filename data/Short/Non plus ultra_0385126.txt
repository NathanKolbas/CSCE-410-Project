EXT--THE SURFACE OF MARS--DAY

The stark landscapes of Mars stretch to the horizon where
orange dunes and red plateaus meet pink sky. BREATHING.
There is MECHANIZED BREATHING and now the barren vista is
DISTORTED IN THE GENTLY-CURVED MIRROR OF A SPACE HELMET.

ROGER TORRAWAY ignores the sweat running down his face.

ROGER'S P.O.V. The red horizon seems even more distant
through Roger's fogged helmet visor, heavy droplets of
water winding their way down the inside of the protective
glass momentarily clearing a path. His BREATHING ECHOES.

Roger's thick boots raise a CLOUD OF RED DUST as he steps
toward a COLLECTION OF SILVER GLEAMING EQUIPMENT set into
the Martian sand. Like a crazy scientist's tinker toys.
Roger bends over the equipment. Reaches out with a thick
gloved hand and touches a panel here. Then a flap there.

A DISTORTED ROGER IS REFLECTED IN THE SILVER. A spaceman
in a red suit against a pink sky bent out of proportion.
Behind Roger a JAGGED RED OUTCROPPING rises above him and
is, too, distorted in the gleaming metal...and then there
is something else. SOMETHING ON TOP OF THE JAGGED ROCK.

It moves fast. Too fast. Not like a man in a spacesuit.

Roger steps down the row of gleaming equipment. And just
behind him THE DISTORTED REFLECTION FOLLOWS. Moving like
an animal in leaps and bounds across the Martian terrain.

Roger's MECHANIZED BREATHING continues as he walks on,
stirring up brief clouds of dust. A SHADOW DANCES ACROSS
HIS BACK. A crazed shadow that is like a man but not
like a man. Followed, a moment later, by a MUTED THUMP.

Roger STOPS BREATHING. Freezes. As if trying to decide
whether or not he just heard something leap down behind
him from the outcropping above. Roger slowly turns. And
slowly, his curved visor comes into view reflecting the
barren red horizon, and the jagged outcropping above, and
then something else: Something with RED GLOWING EYES and
ENORMOUS BAT EARS rising up on either side of its head.

ROGER'S P.O.V. Barely visible through his fogged helmet
visor stands what must be a Martian. It raises ELONGATED
LIMBS into the air and releases a SHRILL INHUMAN SHRIEK.

Roger's eyes open wide as the sweat rushes down his face.

Roger's curved helmet visor reflects the alien one moment
longer before THE MARTIAN EXPLODES splattering FLUID
across the face of Roger's helmet--blocking out the view.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

Roger's BREATHING RETURNS, but frantic now as he stumbles
back clumsily inside his suit, like some medieval knight
reeling from a joust, landing inside a cloud of red dust.

CUT TO:

AIR VENTS IN THE PINK MARTIAN SKY. Air vents that didn't
seem to be there before. Releasing a DEAFENING HISSING.

MECHANICAL VOICE
Pressurizing Mars Tank.

CUT TO:
Roger struggles, slowly, clumsily, rising onto one knee.

MECHANICAL VOICE
Entry in three minutes.

Roger turns toward the distance. Nothing there but the
barren red horizon stretching as far as the eye can see.
Inside his helmet Roger appears to come to some decision:

ROGER
DON'T WAIT FOR ME!

The barren Martian horizon suddenly MOVES. An ENORMOUS
AIRLOCK DOOR BLOWING OPEN AND STRIKING THE WALL WITH A
RESOUNDING DOOOOOM as a DEAFENING RUSH OF AIR BLOWS ROGER
OFF HIS FEET. Like a paper doll. Spinning end-over-end.

Roger hurls toward the distant horizon until he hits a
barrier that doesn't seem to be there. Another WALL.
His visor CRACKS. LOOSE NASA EQUIPMENT HURLS to the wall
just missing him. Sticking there like metal on a magnet.

Roger crashes to the floor inside a cloud of artificial
Martian soil. He lies still a moment. Then his gloved
fingers grasp at the sand. He fights to raise his head:

ROGER'S P.0O.V. Through a SPLINTERED VISOR: DOCTORS AND
NURSES IN REGULAR EVERYDAY WHITE UNIFORMS running across
Mars. An odd sight. Most Doctors stop at the REMAINS OF
THE MARTIAN but some continue, FOOTSTEPS running closer.

The Doctors and Nurses reach Roger and remove his helmet.
Roger just lies there, as if oblivious to them. Watches:

ROGER'S P.O.V. The Doctors are not moving as frantically
as they were a few moments earlier. The Nurses stepping
back and away to reveal a PRIEST kneeling in the red dust
speaking words that make no sense. No. It's LATIN. The
Priest makes the sign of the cross as what's left of the
Martian receives the last sacrament of Extreme Unction...
INT--EXCESSIVELY DECORATED ELEVATOR--DAY

CREDITS ROLL. ROGER, wearing an expensive suit, rides an
elevator and fiddles with his bow tie. Staring straight
ahead. Not looking at the DARK-HAIRED WOMAN IN THE LONG
GOWN on the other side of the cab. They are standing
just far enough apart to suggest they are not acquainted.

Roger frowns. Looks up and to the center above the door.
As if checking the elevator's progress. After a moment,
the Dark-Haired Woman do the same. Then they both look
down and to the side. The Woman gently pats at her hair.
Slowly, Roger exhales. This is one long elevator ride.

 

At the DING, they both stiffen. And, without a glance or
a word, they move next to one another. They clasp hands.

INT--EXCESSIVELY DECORATED HALLWAY--DAY

ROGER and his wife DORRIE step off the elevator holding
hands. Start down a corridor lined on either side with
SECRET SERVICE PERSONNEL. The men are stiff. As if part
of the hall. Roger and Dorrie step past. Smiling wide.

TWO PORTABLE CURTAINS are set-up at the end of the hall.
ONE MALE AND ONE FEMALE AGENT waiting patiently for them:

TWO AGENTS
(in unison)
Good day, Colonel. Mrs. Torraway.

Roger and Dorrie part. Each steps behind their intended
curtain. These curtains are only shoulder-high, allowing
either one to look over at the other. But neither does.

Roger is frisked by the Male Agent as a SECOND MALE AGENT
appears holding a WAND. Moving it over Roger. The First
Agent SNAPS on SURGICAL GLOVES, loosens Roger's belt, and
deftly reaches into his pants. Roger jerks, staring up
at the ceiling. Trying hard to keep a smile. He turns:

ROGER'S P.O.V. Behind her curtain Dorrie is visible from
the neck up, looking irritated as a SECOND FEMALE AGENT
pokes through her hair. The First Female Agent SNAPS on
SURGICAL GLOVES and promptly ducks down out of view.
Dorrie looks ill. Then she drops down out of view, too.

The Second Male Agent pulls Roger's handkerchief from his
pocket. He shakes the handkerchief open and then refolds
it, even neater than before. Roger jerks as his pants
are pulled back into place, and his belt buckled for him.

The Second Female Agent lifts Dorrie's hands, and studies

her PAINTED NAILS. She immediately dips Dorrie's fingers
into a SOLUTION and after a FSSSH her hands are lifted up
and out. Dorrie's fingernail polish has been dissolved.

The First Male and First Female Agent UNSNAP their gloves
and step back, looking from Roger to Dorrie, in tandem:

TWO AGENTS
(in unison)
Thank you, Colonel. Mrs. Torraway.

TWO IDENTICAL DOORS at the end of the hall. One in front
of Roger and one in front of Dorrie. For the first time,
Roger and Dorrie glance at each other. Like a warning.

Roger opens his door to reveal a BLACK MALE PSYCHIATRIST.
Dorrie opens hers to reveal a WHITE FEMALE PSYCHIATRIST.
Both of their offices are identical, to the last detail.
The Psychiatrists stand. Each offers a welcoming smile.

INT--TWO IDENTICAL PSYCHIATRY OFFICES-~-~-DAY

CREDITS END. ROGER steps in and closes the door behind
him. The BLACK MALE PSYCHIATRIST gestures at the chair.

PSYCHIATRIST
Please have a seat.

Roger sits. He looks immediately calm. Almost too calm.

PSYCHIATRIST
Your wife is a very good-looking
woman. Do you mind my saying that?

ROGER
Not at all.

PSYCHIATRIST
Some white people would not like
to hear that from me. How do you
feel about it?

ROGER
I know my wife is sexy. Other men
are bound to be attracted to her
from time to time.

PSYCHIATRIST
You're doing a fine job of appear-
ing unmoved by my questions.

Pause. Roger does not respond. Just sits there looking
calm, pleasant, perfectly at ease; as if he is practiced.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:
PSYCHIATRIST
Would you mind if I took it a bit
further, and asked how the screw-
ing is?

cur TO:

DORRIE KLIKS on a PORTABLE LIGHTER near the end of her
CIGARETTE. Watches the WHITE FEMALE PSYCHIATRIST warily.

DORRIE
Thank you for the cigarette.

PSYCHIATRIST
You're welcome. I've got to tell
you that I find these screenings
to be rather pointless.

DORRIE
Oh...I'm so glad to hear you say
that. I do, too.

Long pause. Dorrie seems calmer now, as if she has found
a fellow conspirator. She looks warm and friendly until:

PSYCHIATRIST
So then. Are you fucking around
on your husband?

CUT TO:
Roger casually crosses his leg. Nods a little. Thinks.

ROGER
Well. The "serewing." It's about
like anybody else's, I guess, after
being married a few years.

CUT TO:

Dorrie takes a drag on that cigarette. She glares icily
at her Psychiatrist, who stares back at her, with a grin.

CUT TO:
Roger looks calm. Watches his Psychiatrist watching him.

PSYCHIATRIST
No problems at home, then? still
like a couple of honeymooners, eh?

ROGER
(with a pleasant chuckle)
Something like that.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED :
cur TO:

Dorrie watches her Psychiatrist coldly. : Blows out SMOKE.

DORRIE
Are you here to psychoanalyze, or
provoke me?

PSYCHIATRIST
Both. Isn't that obvious?

Long pause. Dorrie takes another drag on that cigarette.

DORRIE
(as if defiant)
Yes. I am fucking somebody else.

CUT TO:
Roger watches a PANEL OPEN in the desk as a LENS EMERGES.

PSYCHIATRIST
I'm going to show you a series of
images. After the series, I want
you to tell me the first thing that
comes into your mind. All right?

The room DARKENS. ROGER APPEARS ON THE WALL, an OFFICIAL
NASA PHOTO of astronaut Roger Torraway standing in front
of a phony outer space backdrop, his neck encircled by
the metal collar of his spacesuit. He looks fit. Young.

NASA FOOTAGE APPEARS. Roger inside the space shuttle,
floating in Zero-G, and giving an enthusiastic thumbs up.

The EARTH appears. A RUSSIAN CAPSULE floating above the
great blue bail. ‘The image quickly replaced by the grim
face of a NEWS ANCHOR and the words "DISASTER IN SPACE!"

NEWS ANCHOR
The Russian craft has lost all
maneuvering capability, and the
cosmonauts could burn up in the
outer atmosphere if--

The room is bathed in STARS as more SPACE FOOTAGE plays.
Roger watches AN ASTRONAUT FLOAT TOWARD THE WOUNDED SHIP.

FUZZIER FOOTAGE now of the astronaut making contact with
the damaged craft, almost sliding past the surface before
grabbing hold with a large HOOK. Hanging on by one arm.
His legs floating out over the Earth spiraling far below.

NASA footage from the INTERIOR OF THE SPACE SHUTTLE takes
(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

its place. DELIRIOUSLY HAPPY COSMONAUTS slapping Roger
on the back as they all float in front of the TV camera.

NEWS ANCHOR (V.O.)
.++.in the most daring space rescue
in history, Roger Torraway has....

NEWS FOOTAGE of Roger waving to CROWDS. MORE FOOTAGE of
Dorrie stepping out her front door to rushing REPORTERS.

The final image shows the NASA publicity photo of Roger
seen earlier. But now ON THE COVER OF TIME. The image
is on all four walls and the ceiling, and PROJECTED OVER
TODAY'S ROGER sitting calmly in the Psychiatrist's chair.

The room immediately BRIGHTENS. The LENS RETRACTS. The
Psychiatrist clasps his hands on top of the desk. Waits.

PSYCHIATRIST
The first word that pops to mind?

CUT TO:
Dorrie paces now in the confined space behind her chair.

DORRIE

You should have known Roger years
ago. He used to drag me outside.
Every night, like a kid. We'd go
out and look up at the stars.

(short pause)
He'd try to tell me what they
looked like when you were up there
--with them--and not down here.

Dorrie stops pacing. Grinds her cigarette in an ASHTRAY.

DORRIE
Of course, that was before you all
decided Roger was too big a hero
to risk sending up on any more
space missions. Now we never....

Dorrie trails off. As if she refuses to give any more.
She crosses her arms in front of her chest. Just waits.

CUT TO:

For a moment Roger almost lets his expression slip. But
it never quite does, and his personable smile takes over:

ROGER
Two words come to mind: "ancient
history."

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED :

Roger and

PSYCHIATRIST
Colonel, you know just what I want
you to say, don't you?

ROGER
What you want me to say? I'm sure
I don't know what you mean.

PSYCHIATRIST
I see. Are you feeling violent or
unstable this evening?

ROGER
Well I wasn't until I came in here.

the Psychiatrist immediately engage in a mutual

FORCED CHUCKLE lasting so long it's almost uncomfortable.
It stops ABRUPTLY. The Psychiatrist opens a manila FILE:

PSYCHIATRIST

Of course in your case, sir, this
screening is a formality. You've
had quarterly checks for the last
twelve years, and profiled within
anormal range every time. Let
me ask: Do you feel excited about
meeting the President?

CUT TO:

Dorrie frowns. Watching her smiling Psychiatrist stand.

PSYCHIATRIST
Thank you. You're clear to go on.

DORRIE
You knew I was cheating on Roger,

didn't you? Am I being followed?

PSYCHIATRIST
Mre. Torraway, I'm afraid if you
begin to show signs of paranoia,
I'll have to detain you here for
a few more questions. .

Dorrie hesitates. Then turns on her heels, and leaves.

cuT TO:

Roger finally stands and looks down at his Psychiatrist.

ROGER
Do I feel excited about meeting
the President?

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:
Long pause. Roger seems to be considering the question.

ROGER
No. Not particularly.

INT--EXCESSIVELY DECORATED BALLROOM- -DAY

A door opens. ROGER enters a ballroom filled with WELL-
DRESSED GUESTS and, a moment later, a second door opens
as DORRIE steps out. They move close and scan the room.

DORRIE
(sarcastically)
Well. I'm sure in the mood for
a good time now. .

A WAITER approaches with a TRAY OF DRINKS. Roger takes
two glasses; and the Waiter walks off. Roger hands one
to Dorrie. She takes a quick sip...immediately making a
face with a muffled UGH. Looking for a place to put it.

ROGER
That waiter was secret service,
hon. They put something in the
drinks. To calm you down. If
you don't drink it all, they'll
place an armed guard behind you
the entire evening.

Dorrie looks disgusted. Stares into her glass a moment.
In unison, they down the drinks, frowning with the taste.

MALE VOICE
Ladies and gentlemen...

A reserved PRESIDENTIAL AIDE steps onto a small platform:

AIDE (cont'd)
«+.the President of the United
States.

curt TO:

PRESIDENT FITZ-JAMES DESHATINE smiles and nods his way
around a large circle formed by the Well-Dressed Ballroom
Guests. Shaking every single hand as if it is his last.

Roger and Dorrie wait within the circle, staring straight
ahead, like they're waiting for a bus. After a moment,
FATHER DONALD KAYMAN appears in the background, wearing a
cassock in light of the occasion. He seems to be looking
for someone. Spotting Roger and Dorrie, the Priest steps
up with a quiet AHEM. Roger and Dorrie turn. Make room.

(CONTINUED)
10
CONTINUED:

KAYMAN
(sounding like a priest)
Bless you, my children.
ie
oe ROGER
. (with good humor)
Oh give it a rest, huh?

DORRIE
Shbhhhh. Here he comes.

The President stops in front of Kayman. Looks him in the
eye. The Priest stiffens. The Presidential Aide offers:

AIDE
This is Father Donald Kayman, sir,
our specialist in the planet Mars.

President Deshatine looks at Kayman as if he's impressed.

DESHATINE
I'd like to say that I'm impressed
as all hell, Father, if you'll par-
don the reference.

KAYMAN
I'll clear it with the Almighty,
Mr. President.

DESHATINE
When you step on Mars, you'll be
bigger than the Pope. Are you
ready to spread The Holy Word to
the rest of the solar system?

KAYMAN
I am only one humble servant, sir.

DESHATINE
Hmmm. Well, that makes two of us.

They shake. The President moves on. Takes Roger's hand.

DESHATINE
Colonel. We've met before, after
your fine job with those Russians.
That must have been ten years ago,
when I was chairman of the Senate
committee. My word...has it been
that long since your last mission?

ROGER
(ignoring the question)
It's good to see you again, sir.

(CONTINUED)
11
CONTINUED:

The President releases his hand. Looks over at Dorrie.

DESHATINE
Mrs. Torraway, I hope they didn't
make you soak your fingernails be-
fore you came in.

Dorrie's face animates as the President takes her hand.

DORRIE
They certainly did, Mr. President.

DESHATINE
Well, they just want to make sure
you're not wearing a bio-chemical
poison to scratch me with when we
shake hands, my dear.

The President and Dorrie lean closer, and GIGGLE. As if
that was funny. He smoothly segues into a "speech" mode:

DESHATINE
They tell me it's necessary. As
long as there are wackos running
around. And as long as the ene-
mies of democracy are what they
are--and we're the open trusting
people we are.

Dorrie watches the President move on. A bit awestruck.

DORRIE
Wow. He's so...presidential!

Roger looks amused by her reaction. About to respond
when a hand falls onto his shoulder, and DR. BRADLEY nods
a Hello. He's a good-looking young scientist. Squeezing
into line beside Dorrie. He nods a Hi at Father Kayman.

CAMERA'S P.O.V. All four in view. Father Kayman leaning
close and whispering something to Roger. Roger nodding.
Whispering something back. Dorrie just standing there
staring straight ahead. Next to her, Bradley is doing
the same thing. Just staring straight ahead. There is
sométhing here: Something in the way Dorrie and Bradley
are determined not to acknowledge one another's presence.

CAMERA MOVES, pulls back. Bradley looking all around,
casually. Everywhere but at Dorrie. And Dorrie looking
all around. Casually. So casual, it's almost painful.
Camera pulls back to reveal more and more of the Other
Guests, MUTED WHISPERS ON TOP OF WHISPERS, a cacophony of
excited mutterings. Dorrie and Dr. Bradley seem to be
the only ones in line not whispering about the President.

(CONTINUED)
12

CcuT TO:
The President steps to a podium. Takes a dramatic pause.

DESHATINE
I don't have to tell any of you
what the "Man Plus" project means
to the free world. There's Mars
up there: The only piece of real
estate around worth having, apart
from the one we're all living on
right now. By the end of the de-
cade, Mars is going to belong to
someone--and I want that someone
to be us. You folks are the ones
who are going to make it happen,
because you're going to give us
the man who will live on Mars. I
want to thank you, in the name of
every free citizen of our great
land, for making a dream possible.

Pause. Deshatine looks down a bit. As if self-effacing.

DESHATINE
I am no John F. Kennedy. No sir.
But I know that Mars represents a
dream. A dream for the future of
America, and for al] humankind.

The President looks up to meet the eyes of his audience:

DESHATINE

Humanity will seek its destiny in
outer space. Our next generation
will find their spirits stirred

not by war--but by a new frontier.
This Mars mission does not signal
the end of life on Earth, but the
beginning of a future where every
man, woman, and child are limited

only by what they can dream!

The speech is delivered well. There is no sound in the
ballroom as the ECHO of his voice fades. Everyone stares
up at the podium, as if witness to a great moment. After
a satisfactory pause the President looks off to the side.

DESHATINE
Dr. Bradley? If you would....

Everyone turns as Dr. Bradley steps onto a much smaller
elevation in front of a SCREEN. He takes a REMOTE and
nods respectfully at the President. Looking a bit stiff.

(CONTINUED)
13
CONTINUED:

BRADLEY
A man on Mars would die from lack
of air, but his death would not be
from strangulation. He wouldn't
live long enough to strangle. In
the ten-milli-bar pressure of the
surface of Mars, his blood would
boil, and he would die in agony of
something similar to "the bends."

His delivery improves as he gets immersed in his topic:

BRADLEY (cont'd)
If he survived that, he would die
from a lack of air to breathe. If
he survived that, from exposure
to solar radiation. If he surviv-
ed that, from the extremes of Mar-
tian temperature. And, if he sur-
vived that, he would die a slow
death from thirst and from hunger.

Bradley KLIKS the remote and, behind him, a series of
SCHEMATICS AND DIAGRAMS appear. Of METALLIC LIMBS. What
would seem to be ARTIFICIAL ORGANS. Plastics and pumps.

BRADLEY

If there is no air on Mars, then
we simply need to take the lungs
out of human beings, and replace
them with new micro-miniaturized
oxygen-regeneration cat-cracking
systems. If human blood would
boil, then we eliminate the blood.

Father Kayman listens. With a slightly disturbed look.

BRADLEY (0.8.)
Build arms and legs serviced by
motors instead of muscles...

Next to Kayman is Roger. His face betrays no expression.

BRADLEY (0.8.)
..-and reserve a supply of blood
only for the brain. If all human
musculature is replaced...

Dorrie is staring at Bradley, most intently; but from her
expression she doesn't seem to be listening to the words.

BRADLEY (0.S.)
.+.then food requirements drop,
and water is no longer necessary.

(CONTINUED)
14
CONTINUED:

Bradley KLIKS a new set of sketches for ARTIFICIAL SKIN
and detailed schematics for strange ARTIFICIAL EYEBALLS.

BRADLEY
We clothe the body in artificial
skin to protect it from the solar
radiation. And replace the eyes
with impervious mechanical struc-
tures.

Bradley hits the remote, and the images FADE. He stares
out over the assembly. Looking moved by his recitation:

BRADLEY
If one does all of these things
to a human being, what's left is
not precisely a human being. It
is a man plus large elements of
hardware.

President Deshatine scans the crowd. Subdued. Serious.

DESHATINE
We lost a good man last week. A
brave man. William G. Hartnett.
Major Hartnett to some. "Willy"
to others. A friend to all who
give their lives to the conquest
of space. His courage will take
this program to Mars and beyond.

The President seems to stand tall suddenly. To perk up.

DESHATINE
But we're not here for eulogies.

CAMERA MOVES, pans the Well-Dressed Guests. Astronauts.
Technicians. Scientists. Bureaucrats. Male and female.

DESHATINE (0.S.)
We're here to announce the next
candidate for the Man Plus Pro-
ject. He's already risked his
life for his country. And, God
love him, wants to do it again.

Some heads are turning, asking muted questions, receiving
only SHRUGS and SHAKING HEADS in response. In the middle
of the crowd stands Roger, Dorrie, and Father Kayman.
Kayman and Dorrie look as much in the dark as everyone
else does. Roger stares ahead. Without much expression.

DESHATINE
I'm proud to simply say his name.

(CONTINUED)
15
CONTINUED :

Roger displays no expression. Dorrie's face moves from
attentive to blank to confused to stunned in seconds, as:

DESHATINE (0.S.)
COLONEL ROGER TORRAWAY.

The Well-Dressed Guests in the ballroom all turn to look
at Roger. Father Kayman's mouth is hanging open. Dorrie
turns just a bit--and so does Bradley--and for a moment
they catch each other's eye. The President smiles wide.

Roger and Dorrie turn to face one another. They step
into each other's arms. The crowd shuffles back and away
to give them room. Roger and Dorrie move in for a kiss:

DORRIE .
(thru a strained smile)
You might have told your wife.

Roger looks into her eyes. Really deeply into her eyes.

ROGER
Are you really that surprised?

Dorrie looks up at him...and simply shakes her head. No.

Roger and Dorrie kiss clumsily, and then embrace. Dorrie
burying most of her face into his shoulder. Roger holds
her tight as he looks out over the assembly. He smiles.

The President of the United States starts CLAPPING with
fury. The Presidential Aide CLAPS, looking around, as if
giving a silent command to clap. The grim Waiters who
are really Secret Service begin CLAPPING, with gusto,
though their expressions remain grim. And, slowly, the
Well-Dressed Guests begin to CLAP. They look generally
dazed. As if they are not sure what exact expression to
wear. Father Kayman begins to CLAP, his face giving away
his conflicting emotions. But soon everyone is CLAPPING.

Roger stares past Dorrie's head resting on his shoulder.
He loses his smile for a moment, until it comes back even
wider. The ballroom drowning in the sound of CLAPPING.

INT--THE MARS-NORMAL TANK--DAY

ROGER stands in street clothes on the red surface of Mars
staring at the distant horizon depicted on the wall. As
if lost in thought. That familiar red jagged outcropping
rises above him. Roger is startled as he hears a THUNK.

He turns to see a MAINTENANCE MAN in a jumpsuit drop his
EQUIPMENT into the fake red dust. Backing out toward the

open airlock revealing the HALLWAY beyond. The Man looks
like he's seen a ghost, almost stumbling as he backs out:

MAINTENANCE MAN
E-excuse me, I'm sorry.

Roger opens his mouth and begins to gesture, as if to say
to him. that he doesn't have to go...but he never says it.
Just watches the nervous Man back clumsily from the room.

INT--SMALL SCREENING ROOM- -DAY

ROGER sits in a makeshift theater. It is DARK. The room
bathed in a GLOW. There is no sound, but whatever Roger
is watching is THROWING CRAZED SHADOWS ACROSS THE WALLS.

The door opens a crack. FATHER KAYMAN sees Roger and
steps inside, quietly moving to take a seat a bit behind
him, Roger doesn't turn to see who's there. Kayman
watches for just a moment, but doesn't seem interested
with the images on the screen. Staring mostly at Roger.

KAYMAN
(with forced casualness)
What are you watching?

Roger doesn't turn. Just frowns a bit. Doesn't respond.

KAYMAN
Looks like tapes of Willy working
out in the Mars tank.

Long pause. Roger and Kayman stare straight ahead at the
screen. FURIOUS SHADOWS DANCE ACROSS THEM AND THE WALLS.

KAYMAN
You're the perfect candidate, you
know that, don't you? You, Roger,
are just what they're looking for.

No response. Kayman stares at the back of Roger's head.

KAYMAN
Angry. Desperate. Reckless. I
daresay, it's the perfect resume.
Well. You always said you'd do
anything to get back into space--

ROGER
(interrupting)
"Roger, don't do it." It's four
simple words, if that's what you
came here to say, Don.

(CONTINUED)
17
CONTINUED;

Kayman starts to speak but stops himself. Looking almost
guilty. He turns to the screen. There is a long pause.

ROGER
You don't know what it's like to
be up there, with the stars, and
then come back down here.

KAYMAN
No, I don't know what it's like.
Maybe when I do I'll understand
why the rest of your life seems
to hold such little joy for you.

Long pause. They watch. FRENZIED SHADOWS ON THE WALLS.

KAYMAN
This morning the Asians launched
their Mars lander into orbit. I
hear it's performing beyond even
their expectations.

ROGER
I know.

KAYMAN
Word is our timetable is moving .
up. If true, you'll be hitting
the operating table seven weeks
sooner than expected.

ROGER
I know.

Short pause. For the first time, Roger turns toward him.

ROGER
That what you wanted to tell me?

KAYMAN
I can't find Bradley. He hasn't
heard the news--and no one seems
to know where he is.

ROGER
I'll find him for you. There's
no reason for me to stay around
here doing nothing. Besides...

Roger stands up. But he doesn't take his eyes from those
images on the screen. THE SHADOWS PLAY ACROSS HIS FACE.

ROGER (cont'd)
I think I make people nervous.

INT--STERILE COMPLEX CORRIDOR--DAY

ROGER steps to a door marked "ADMINISTRATIVE STATISTICS."
He KNOCKS. Moments pass. Nothing happens. Roger KNOCKS
louder. The door doesn't move but. a SPY-HOLE slides open
wide enough for one EYEBALL to peek out and all around.

ROGER
It's Colonel Torraway. Open up.

The spy-hole slides shut. Roger waits. Nothing happens.
He raises his fist again to knock when there is a KLIK.
The door opens. The GRIM MAN who answers looks like FBI.

Beyond him is an OFFICE filled with ROLLTOP DESKS. At
each desk sit MORE MEN AND WOMEN WHO LOOK LIKE FBI. All
of the desks have their tops rolled down, concealing the
contents. Everyone in the room just sitting there at
closed desks staring blankly at the door. And at Roger.

The Grim Man who answered the door does not say a word.

ROGER
I need to locate Dr. Bradley.

The Grim Man does not respond. Doesn't even move. Just
stands in the doorway. Roger waits a moment. Then takes
one step closer so that their faces are only inches away.

ROGER
(calm and yet forceful)
Look. I know you people watch us.
And I know that you know where Dr.
Bradley is. So why not be a good
whatever the hell you are and te--

A GRIM WOMAN appears in the door. She is matter-of-fact:

GRIM WOMAN

Colonel. You might try the Chero
Strip Hotel. Dr. Bradley does en-
tertain there, on occasion; often
during the after lunch hour. You
might ask for him under the name
Beckwith. But I strongly suggest
that you telephone. And it might
be best if you allow us to--

ROGER
(interrupting)
No, thanks. I'll just go myself.

Roger starts to go. But hesitates as the Grim Man in the
door drops his concrete facade, looking almost plaintive.

(CONTINUED)
19
CONTINUED:

GRIM MAN
Colonel. I strongly suggest that
you let us handle this ourselves.

Roger gives them a quizzical look. And goes on his way.
The Grim Man and Grim Woman stand in the doorway a moment
longer. Watching Roger go. They share an ominous look.

Stepping back finally and closing that nondescript door
with the little sign reading "ADMINISTRATIVE STATISTICS."

EXT--AUTOMOTIVE PARKING LOT--DAY

ROGER opens the door of his SPORTS CAR. Slips behind the
wheel. The car looks normal, except for the DASHBOARD.

ROGER
Manual.

The ENGINE ROARS. Roger takes the wheel. SCREECHES off.

EXT--DRIVING DOWN THE STRIP--DAY

ROGER drives down the motel row of TONKA, OKLAHOMA. Very
astronaut-friendly. Signs tell tourists: "HOME OF THE
MARS ASTRONAUTS!" Restaurant logos incorporate ROCKETS.

INT--THE CHERO STRIP HOTEL--DAY

ROGER walks through the lobby of an economy hotel. Up to
the desk. The CLERK looks up, but before he can speak:

ROGER
I'm looking for a Dr. Brad-- Um.
Beckwith.

The Clerk moves to the computer. Hits a few keys. Nods.

CLERK
Mr. and Mrs. Beckwith. Room 324.
(short pause)
I'm sorry, they just checked out.

EXT--THE HOTEL PARKING LOT--DAY

ROGER steps out and walks to his car. Gets in. He sits
there, window open, his elbow resting on top of the door.

ROGER
Automatic.

(CONTINUED)
20
CONTINUED:

The ENGINE ROARS. Roger stares out the open driver's
side window. He looks hesitant about something. Then:

ROGER
Home. Take me home.

The STEERING WHEEL TURNS BY ITSELF and the car pulls out
of the lot. Roger stares at the passing street. Lost in
thought. His elbow resting on the door. His other hand
on his lap. A passenger behind his own steering wheel.

EXT--DRIVING PAST RESIDENCES--DAY

ROGER rides through a quiet Tonka neighborhood. Watches
the houses pass. The BRAKE PEDAL DEPRESSES and the WHEEL
TURNS as the car enters a driveway. The GARAGE OPENING.

INT--ROGER AND DORRIE'S HOME~--DAY

ROGER enters a comfortable-looking home. Not furnished
expensively, by any means, but with some style. He stops
there in the kitchen. Listens. Doesn't hear anything.

ROGER
Dorrie? Hon, you home?

Nothing. Roger frowns. Then hears a MUFFLED CAR ENGINE.
Roger steps through the kitchen to a hall with a window:

ROGER'S P.O.V. A CAR outside on the drive. Not quite as
sporty as Roger's. The door opens. DORRIE getting out.

Roger steps quickly down the hall to the front door, like
he's anxious to see her. He places his hand on the knob
but then waits. As if to calm himself. Finally he opens
the door: Dorrie is just on the other side holding out a
KEY. Her eyebrows raised in surprise. Surprise? More
like shock. She doesn't move an inch. Dorrie looks like
a snapshot of herself frozen in the middle of the porch.

ROGER
I need to speak to you. I just
came from the Chero Strip look-
ing for Bradley.

Long pause. Dorrie doesn't move. As if frozen in place.
DORRIE
All right, Roger. Let me come
in, and sit down.

Dorrie walks past Roger. Her expression still glassy and

21
CONTINUED :

dazed. She stops to look at herself in a MIRROR on the
wall. Dorrie rubs off a SMUDGE on her face. Fluffs her
hair. She proceeds stiffly into the living room. Sits.

Dorrie lifts a CIGARETTE from the table, bringing it to
her mouth. The cigarette stops before it gets there as
Roger enters the room. Dorrie doesn't look over at him.

DORRIE
Please, go ahead.

Dorrie inserts the cigarette between her lips. Lifts a
BUTANE FLAME toward the tip. The FLAME QUIVERS. Roger
watches her try to light the cigarette, her hand shaking.
Dorrie frowns. As if defeated. Pulls the cigarette from
her mouth. She looks like she's preparing to enter hell.

ROGER
Our timetable has been moved up.

Dorrie stares at him. Not so much concerned, as puzzled.

ROGER
The Asians are further along than
anyone thought. They have a work-
ing Mars lander in orbit, complet-
@ ing its first initial test run.

Long pause. The look on Dorrie's face is apprehensive.
As if she was prepared for something much worse and still
thinks it's coming. Roger waits for this all to sink in.

ROGER
Don't you understand, hon?

DORRIE
Yes. I mean, it's a little hard
to take in--but didn't you start
out by saying something about
Brad, and the Chero Strip?

ROGER
No one can find him. You know
Bradley. He's probably shacked
up with one of the nurses.

Roger stops. Looks down at his watch. He considers it.

ROGER
I should be getting back myself.
But I wanted to break this news

e@ to you. In person.

Dorrie watches him. Nods, slowly. As if still confused.
(CONTINUED)
22
CONTINUED:

DORRIE
Thank you, honey.
(short pause)
Wouldn't it have been easier to
phone?

ROGER
Phone...who?

DORRIE
Brad. At the hotel.

ROGER
Oh. Sure. I guess.

Roger's face slackens. As if something has just occurred
to him but he's not quite sure if his perception is true.

ROGER (cont'd)
How did you know that Brad was
at the hotel?

Short pause. A glint of worry passes over Dorrie's face.

DORRIE
You told me you just came from
the Chero Strip. I assume you
meant the Chero Strip Hotel.

Roger digests this. It only takes a moment, and then he
seems completely satisfied, nodding almost imperceptibly.

ROGER

(as if relieved)
I'm proud of you, hon. I tell
you our timetable has moved up
and you take it like a trooper.

Dorrie looks taken aback for a moment. As if she almost
forgot. She steps closer and wraps her arms around him.

DORRIE
I've been an astronaut's wife a
long time, Roger. I'm prepared
for things like this.

ROGER
It'll be just like the old days.
The magazines calling for your
latest recipe.

DORRIE
And beauty tips. Don't forget
the beauty tips.

(CONTINUED)
23

ROGER
Oh of course. The reading public
has to know how you keep yourself
looking so good when your husband
is on another planet.

Roger and Dorrie both LAUGH, and it appears to feel good.

ROGER
Hope I didn't scare you too much
when you saw me at the door.

DORRIE
Don't be silly.

Dorrie looks a bit guilty at her response. Squeezes him.

DORRIE
I'll be so proud, Rog, when you
land on Mars; and we'll have long
happy lives when you come home.

Pause. Roger stares over her shoulder. Rather soberly.

ROGER
You know when I get back they'll
have to re-build me. Give me a
new body. I might not look the--

DORRIE
(interrupting)
You'll be the same man. Inside.

Dorrie pulls back. Squeezes his arm like a father might.

DORRIE
You better get going. Don't you
worry about me. I'm all right.

Dorrie steps over to the table. Retrieves her cigarette.
And this time she lights it. Takes a puff. Now that her
back is turned toward Roger her expression becomes cold:

DORRIE
I don't want you racing around
town looking for Brad. If he's
up to something he shouldn't be
then that's his own problem.

Dorrie turns around to face Roger. Her face warm again.
DORRIE (cont'd)

With everything that's coming up
we have to start thinking of you!
24

INT--NEWS ANCHOR DESK--NEWSCAST

A NIGHTLY NEWS ANCHOR sits in front of an abstract map of
the world. INDIVIDUAL NASA PHOTOS of the MEMBERS OF THE
MARS CREW open up behind him. We recognize FATHER KAYMAN
and BRADLEY, but the OTHER THREE will be unknown to us.

One of the other three GETS LARGER, covering the others:

ANCHOR
NASA officials revealed today that
veteran astronaut William Hartnett
has died. No word as to the cause
of death or who will replace Major
Hartnett aboard the proposed first
manned mission to Mars.

INT--MAN PLUS SURGICAL CUBE--DAY

UNDERWATER. IN SOME KIND OF FLUID. It's like looking up
from the bottom of a pool. Suddenly, ROGER breaks the
surface of the water. He sinks closer. Closer. BUBBLES
obscuring the view. Slowly revealing his face: Roger is
unconscious. A BREATHING MASK over his nose and mouth.

INT--LARGE CONFERENCE ROOM-~--DAY

A table lined with NASA OFFICIALS and MAN PLUS PERSONNEL.
FATHER KAYMAN and BRADLEY are there. Other faces that
may be recognizable from the ballroom scene. Everyone
watches as an OLD CORONER slowly stands, with his REPORT.

CORONER
Major Hartnett died from a brain
hemorrhage.

INT--MAN PLUS SURGICAL CUBE--DAY

ROGER floats just under the surface of his FLUIDIZED BED
in a BLINDING WHITE CUBE that appears self-illuminating.
MASKED SURGEONS step up. They look down. After a moment
one of them raises a CIRCULAR SAW. A tiny KLIK and the
saw rotates with a shrill WHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEFE.

INT--CHERO STRIP HOTEL ROOM-~-DAY

DORRIE stands at the window. The heavy drapes are drawn.
The room is dark save for the one thin band of sunlight
sneaking in between the curtains. Half of her face in
the sun, half out. Dorrie takes a drag on her CIGARETTE.
25

INT--MAN PLUS SURGICAL CUBE--DAY

Floating. In some kind of fluid. ROGER suspended in the
fluid. Unconscious. Limp hands floating on either side
of his head. He looks intact. His head bobbing. Arms
bobbing. Until his ARMS FLOAT JUST FAR ENOUGH AWAY--and
at such an impossible angle--that it's clear they've been
SEVERED. Another moment and ONE OF HIS LEGS FLOATS PAST.

INT--LARGE CONFERENCE ROOM--DAY
The CORONER stops reading. He looks down the long table:

CORONER
The truth is we're applying new
pressures to the brain. Think
of the human brain as a "radio."
We're all attempting to stick TV
signals into it. And the brain
simply doesn't know what to do.

Short pause. The NASA AND MAN PLUS STAFF listen. Grim.

CORONER
The same thing that happened to
William will, eventually, happen
to Roger. Now, this is fact.

INT--MAN PLUS COMPLEX CHAPEL--DAY

A small dark chapel. Undeniably inviting if compared to
the clinical corridor outside. FATHER KAYMAN steps in.
Takes the second in a row of stubby pews. Kayman reaches
into his pocket and removes his ROSARY. Begins to pray.

INT--THE WHITE HOUSE BEDROOM- -DAY
PRESIDENT DESHATINE wakes up. Blinks. His AIDE offers:

AIDE
Time to get up, Mr. President.

DESHATINE
Before I fell asleep my approval
rating was down 17%, with 61% of
the public judging this admini-
stration poor to unsatisfactory.

AIDE
Yes, sir. I'm afraid it did not
improve during your nap.
26

INT--MAN PLUS SURGICAL CUBE--DAY

ROGER floats just under the surface of his fluidized bed
with CABLES stretching from his limbless body out of the
water to ARTIFICIAL ARMS AND LEGS held by thick supports
beside the bed. His SURGEONS resemble technicians now as
they operate computer TERMINALS. The arms and legs are
silver, like polished steel. Fingers and toes TWITCHING.

INT--BIOLOGICAL LABORATORY - -DAY

Looking up from the P.O.V. of whatever is at the bottom
of a SMALL CAGE: TWO BIO-RESEARCHERS in white lab coats
and thick glasses staring down, as if they are entranced.

RESEARCHER 1
The initial shape is created with
a polyester.

RESEARCHER 2
Then you inject human cartilage?

RESEARCHER 1
Yes. We surgically implant the
ear or nose onto the mouse, which
nourishes the new appendage the
same way it nourishes the rest of
its body. The cartilage grows to
gradually replace the polyester.

RESEARCHER 2
Hmmm. So you end up with living
tissue you can transplant onto a
human subject. Intriguing.

RESEARCHER 1
We'll be able to construct a new
nose, and a new set of ears, for
Colonel Torraway when he returns
from Mars, to his specifications.

Long pause. The Two Bio-Researchers stare into the cage.

RESEARCHER 2
(suddenly reflective)
How do you suppose people will
react to this?

RESEARCHERS' P.O.V. Looking down into the cage: MICE
running around the bottom. EACH WITH A HUMAN NOSE OR EAR
ON THEIR BACKS. Perfect actual-size human noses and ears
growing on the backs of furry mice scurrying around and
over one another. Bizarre. Sickening. The mice scurry.
27

INT--CHERO STRIP HOTEL ROOM--DAY
DORRIE stares out the window. She smokes her cigarette.

BRADLEY (0.S.)
Hey. Come back to bed.

Dorrie makes a half-turn. Sees BRADLEY sitting up in the
hotel bed. The blanket bunched around his waist reveals
his chest. He pats the pillow beside him in invitation.

Dorrie turns back to the window. She stares out between
the heavy drapes. Bright outside. Dorrie doesn't move.

INT--NEWS ANCHOR DESK--NEWSCAST

A NIGHTLY NEWS ANCHOR aniles for the public. Behind him
a SCREEN displays the attentive FACE OF ROGER TORRAWAY.

ANCHOR

We are back with astronaut Roger
Torraway. For those of you who
may be joining us late, NASA has
announced that Colonel Torraway
will join the crew of the first
manned flight to our neighboring
red planet, Mars.

The Anchor swivels in his chair. On sereen Roger smiles.

ANCHOR
It's been a while since you've
been in space, Colonel. You
must feel like a rookie again.

INT--NASA BROADCAST STUDIO--DAY

The room is LINED WITH SCREENS. TECHNICIANS work behind
elaborate CONSOLES. A BALDING MIDDLE-AGED FAT MAN, who
looks nothing like Roger, sits at the center of it all.
His face is COVERED WITH SENSORS. Every movement of his
face, from the broadest grin to the slightest raised
eyebrow, mimicked by the. ROGER FACE on the video screens.

FAT MAN
Let me tell you, Chet. You feel
like a rookie every time you lift-
off into space. There is nothing
mundane about manned space flight.

CAMERA MOVES, down the row of screens. EACH PERFECTS THE
MOVEMENT AND SOUND OF THE ROGER FACE until the last one

INT--MAN PLUS SURGICAL CUBE--DAY

MASKED SURGEONS are gathered around the fluidized bed.
One has his hands underneath the water. Coming up with
an INTERNAL ORGAN. He drops it into the hands of another
surgeon who, in turn, drops it into the hands of another.
One of the surgeons holds out the ARTIFICIAL REPLACEMENT.

INT--BIOLOGICAL LABORATORY - -DAY

RESEARCHERS' P.O.V.. Looking into the cage: MICE running
around and over one another. - EACH WITH A HUMAN NOSE OR
EAR ON THEIR BACKS. Perfect actual-size noses and ears.

The TWO BIO-RESEARCHERS in lab coats watch. One frowns.

RESEARCHER 1
Uh-oh.

RESEARCHER 2
What?

RESEARCHER 1
I had twelve mice this morning.

RESEARCHER 2
I count eleven.

RESEARCHER 1
Yes, I do, too.

RESEARCHER 2
Uh-oh.

INT--CORRIDOR NURSE STATION--DAY

An OVER-WORKED NURSE leans against a counter scribbling
on a CLIPBOARD. She flips through the pages. Writes.
FOOD CRUMBS on the countertop. The Nurse flips through
the pages. Writes. Suddenly, a MOUSE WITH A HUMAN EAR
ON ITS BACK scurries into view. Stop. Go. As if afraid
of the giant nurse creature. It reaches the crumbs and
begins to eat. Tiny hands and mouth working furiously.
The Nurse frowns. As if she senses something. Looks up.

sound of the HORRIFIED FEMALE SCREAM they both look up.

INT--A WHITE HOUSE CORRIDOR--DAY

PRESIDENT DESHATINE walks down a hallway wearing pajamas.
He's holding his stomach. The PRESIDENTIAL AIDE follows.

DESHATINE
Uh. I don't feel good.

AIDE
Dr. Strassen did advise you not
to eat any more cabbage.

DESHATINE
Shut-up. I don't want the cab-
bage lecture again.

The President stops, as if experiencing a wave of nausea.

AIDE
During your nap I'm afraid that
Australia has declared war.

DESHATINE
What? With who?

AIDE
With itself, sir. The New New
Australians have attacked the
Old New Australians.

The nausea passes, and Deshatine continues down the hall.

DESHATINE
Our official position will be
that this affair in Australia
is a domestic matter, and not
a national concern for the
United States, blah blah blah.

AIDE
Very good, Mr. President.

DESHATINE
What's the latest from the NPA?

AIDE
"Anti-America" demonstrations
are still going on in Shanghai,
Saigon, Hiroshima, and a half-
dozen other cities throughout
the New People's Asia.

(CONTINUED)
30
CONTINUED:

DESHATINE
Anything else?

AIDE
An epidemic of small pox is out
of control in Botswana. Welsh
nationals have blown up Knights-
bridge. With a plutonium bomb.

The President stops outside a door. He looks impatient.

AIDE (cont'd)
Would you like to hear about the
Middle East, or Near East first?

DESHATINE
Neither. I'm going to the john.

Deshatine disappears through the door as his Aide waits.

AIDE
You may want to check the latest
computer simulation.

INT--A WHITE HOUSE RESTROOM--DAY

PRESIDENT DESHATINE sits on the toilet in a small ornate
restroom. Frowning. He reaches next to the toilet paper
roll and PULLS OPEN THE COMPUTER SET INTO THE WALL.
Deshatine searches the keyboard. Hits a key with a BLIP.

The SCREEN COMES ALIVE DISPLAYING A CHART with one BROAD
BLACK LINE GROWING DIAGONALLY UPWARD toward a RED BAR
that is ominously labeled: "OUTBREAK OF HOSTILITIES."
From out in the corridor comes the Aide's MUFFLED VOICE:

AIDE (0.8.)
That's a composite of twenty-two
trends and indices, ranging from
the international credit balance
to the frequency of harassment of
American tourists abroad.

Deshatine looks nauseous. He just stares straight ahead.

AIDE (0.8.)
It is a statistical probability
of world war. You might notice
that we are rapidly approaching
a "critical mass"; that is, if
you put any faith in such things.

The President frowns as he pulls down on the toilet roll.
31

EXT--CHERO HOTEL PARKING LOT--DAY

BRADLEY walks from the hotel toward a SPORTS CAR. Opens
the door and starts to slide in...when he sees something.
On the hood of his car is a FROG. A tiny, everyday frog.
Bradley stares at this frog. Like it's really something.

INT--MAN PLUS SURGICAL CUBE--DAY

MASKED SURGEONS huddle around Roger's fluidized bed. One
holding a SCALPEL. A NURSE steps up and touches his arm:

NURSE
Word has come down from the Major.
Colonel Torraway is to retain his
face until just prior to lift-off.

The Surgeons exchange looks. One hands over the scalpel.

NURSE
The psych people think it'll help
him to adjust.

CAMERA'S P.O.V. Looking down into the fluid: Floating
just under the surface is ROGER. Hard to see through the
thick swirling fluid. But METALLIC ARMS AND LEGS are
visible; and an OPEN TORSO PACKED WITH ARTIFICIAL ORGANS.
Though under the water, Roger is not wearing anything
over his face. That breathing mask seen earlier is GONE.

INT--LARGE CONFERENCE ROOM--DAY

The long table of NASA OFFICIALS and MAN PLUS PERSONNEL.
BRADLEY stands and CLEARS HIS THROAT. He hits a REMOTE:
on the wall behind him, FOOTAGE OF A FROG begins to play.

BRADLEY
Ladies and gentlemen. Consider
the frog.

It is an everyday frog. Not moving. Just sitting there.

BRADLEY
If an insect passes in front of
a frog, the frog's eye will per-
ceive that insect. Nerves will
transmit the information to the
frog's brain, and the brain will
respond by ordering the frog to
immediately consume the insect.

A FLY BUZZES into view, and the FROG IMMEDIATELY EATS IT.
32

INT--MAN PLUS SURGICAL CUBE--DAY

The fluidized bed drains out onto a flat surface. Murky
fluid SLOSHING over the sides as ROGER emerges and slides
across the platform coming to a stop. Below the neck his
body is encased in what appear to be MINIATURE RED TILES.

CAMERA'S P.O.V. Looking up at the row of MASKED SURGEONS
on either side staring down at Roger. Almost in unison,
the Surgeons pull down their masks REVEALING THEIR FACES
FOR THE FIRST TIME. Now, they look quite human. Like
individuals. Each one lost in thought. Until suddenly:

SURGEON 1
(shaken by the notion)
Christ. If the public knew what
we were doing to their hero....

The Surgeon trails off. As if the thought was too scary.
The Others exchange a glance; and, almost in unison, the
Surgeons pull their masks back up, covering their faces.

INT--LARGE CONFERENCE ROOM--DAY

BRADLEY gestures at the FROG. Just sitting there. Now a
LEAF falls into view landing beside the motionless frog.

BRADLEY
But, if a leaf drops down beside
the frog, we see that it doesn't
eat the leaf. It's not that the
frog decides not to eat the leaf.
The frog simply never sees it.

The NASA AND MAN PLUS STAFF watch him. As if he's nuts.

BRADLEY
The signal from the frog's eye is
dropped before it ever reaches the
brain. The frog's brain never
becomes aware of what the frog has
just seen--because it doesn't need
to be aware.

Bradley smiles. As if his point is delightfully obvious:

BRADLEY
It's simply irrelevant for a frog
to know whether or not a leaf has
dropped down in front of it.

Bradley hits the remote, and a SCHEMATIC FOR A BACKPACK
COMPUTER replaces the frog. It looks as if this backpack

would be integrated with Roger. A physical part of him.

e@ BRADLEY

We cannot change the human brain.
We're stuck with it. But we can
influence what information reaches
the brain. I propose that we use
a computer to filter and regulate
what Roger feels and sees.

FATHER KAYMAN is clearly disturbed by this. He sits up.

KAYMAN
You're suggesting that we route
Roger's perceptions through this
computer--before they reach his
brain?

BRADLEY
Yes, that's what I'm suggesting.

Kayman seems offended. Looks around in search of someone
who feels the same. Everyone else seems lost in thought.

KAYMAN
But would Roger still be Roger?
@ Would he even be human anymore?

Pause. Bradley looks almost dumbfounded by the question.

BRADLEY
What do you want me to say? I
don't have the answers to those
questions. I'm simply telling
the panel what the next logical
step is. This is our best hope
of keeping Roger's brain from
overloading while he's on Mars.

INT--CHERO STRIP HOTEL ROOM--DAY

DORRIE stands at the window. The heavy drapes are drawn.
The room dark save for the thin band of sunlight sneaking
between the curtains. Half of her face in the sun, half
out. Dorrie takes a drag on her cigarette. She squeezes
her eyes shut. And, when she opens them, TEARS run out.

FATHER KAYMAN steps in. Takes the second in the row of
pews. He reaches into his pocket for his rosary. At the
SOUND OF THE FALLING BEADS Kayman looks down. The rosary
has snapped. Dozens of LOOSE BEADS scattering, coming to
rest on the hard floor. ONE TINY GOLD CROSS among them.

INT--NEWS ANCHOR DESK--NEWSCAST
A strange FOREIGN FLAG appears as the NEWS ANCHOR begins:

ANCHOR
With the New People's Asia having
formally announced their intention
to land a manned crew on Mars, it
would appear we are plunged into a
space race, not dissimilar to last
century's "race to the moon."

OLD BLACK-AND-WHITE footage from the "SPACE RACE" plays.
Replaced by a photograph of MARS and a big QUESTION MARK.

ANCHOR (cont'd)
Some analysts are suggesting that
it won't be much of a race, adding
that neither the U.S. or the N.P.A.
have much hope of lifting-off be-
fore their proposed fall deadline.

A window opens and a SIMULATION OF THE PLANETS EARTH AND
MARS ROTATING AROUND THE SUN plays. As the two planets
orbit--each at its own speed and distance from the sun--
it is clear that at times Earth appears to approach Mars
and-.the two seem "closer." A DOTTED LINE traces a path.

ANCHOR
The Earth and the planet Mars are
properly aligned every 26 months.
This alignment, utilizing the di-
rection of the Earth's rotation to
lesson the amount of fuel that is
required for the lengthy journey,
will end in September.

Tests on the Mars Ares rocket con-
tinue, with only varying degrees
of success. Still, NASA officials
insist they are ahead of schedule...

INT--MAN PLUS SURGICAL CUBE--DAY

ROGER is suspended above the floor inside a MAZE OF TUBES
that seem to pass right through his body. The tubes lead
to big TANKS that are filling with a kind of MILKY FLUID.
Roger hangs limply inside the web of tubes. Unconscious.

ANCHOR (V.O.)
.+..and that all equipment will be
functioning and ready in time for
lift-off.

Suddenly Roger OPENS HIS EYES. Normal, human eyes. He
stares ahead, blankly, as if not fully awake yet, when a
SECOND INNER EYELID CLOSES. But it is not made of flesh.
These eyelids are METALLIC and emerge from the sides of
the eye. There is a WHIRRING as these new eyelids OPEN:

Roger looks out with LARGE TELESCOPIC LENSES where his
human eyes used to be. The lids close again to WHIRRING.
When they open, a THIRD SET OF EYES are visible. These
eyes have an EERIE RED GLOW. The glow makes the tiles
encasing his body illuminate with multiple shades of red.

BRADLEY stands with the NURSES. All looking up at Roger.

BRADLEY
Good morning, Roger. I want you
to know you can plan on sleeping
in a regular bed in a few days.
The fluid draining from you is a
temporary by-product of your new
system. It will pass, I promise.

He pauses. Trying to determine whether Roger is alert.

BRADLEY
I don't want you to talk, not yet.
But your speech center is hooked
up to the speakers in the room so
you should be able to communicate
without actually moving your lips.
Just "think" what you want to say.

(CONTINUED)
36
CONTINUED :

Long pause. Bradley and the Nurses wait. The SPEAKERS
set into the corners of the room remain silent. Roger
doesn't move an inch. But then a MECHANIZED VOICE says:

SPEAKER
Headache. In my chest.

Bradley and the Nurses wait. Listen for more. Finally:

SPEAKER
Inside of mouth itches.

BRADLEY
Your sensations won't make sense
for a while; so don't be alarmed.
(short pause)
Any more "general" observations?
What are your emotions?

Nothing for a moment. Then Roger suddenly jerks. As if
trying to get loose from the tubes. Bradley steps close.

BRADLEY
Easy there, Rog. Take it easy.

SPEAKER
Had bad dream.

Roger's expression is of a man waking from a dream. Not
realizing yet that it was all just a dream; or, maybe,
resolving himself to the fact that this dream was real:

SPEAKER
Not...a dream,

Roger pulls his arm out of place just. enough to DISLODGE
A CONNECTION as MILKY FLUID SPURTS from the crack. This
seems to upset Roger even more. He jerks more of the
tubes loose and MORE MILKY FLUID SPURTS ACROSS THE ROOM.
One of the TANKS TUMBLES OVER SLOSHING FLUID ACROSS THE
FLOOR, the Nurses scrambling out of the way of the tank.

Bradley slips on the wet floor and slides. Trying to get
up and failing. Covered in milky fluid. He crawls to a
COMPUTER TERMINAL and SLAMS his fist down onto the panel.
Immediately the SQUIRTING FLUID SLOWS TO A WEAK TRICKLE.

Everyone watches. Roger struggles for a few more moments
before going limp. Just hanging now from the cracked and
damaged tubes. He opens his mouth, as if to speak, but
MILKY FLUID SPILLS OVER HIS LIPS reducing it to a GURGLE.

CLOSE-UP OF ROGER. Those METALLIC EYELIDS CLOSE and with
a WHIRRING Roger's HUMAN EYES RETURN. Warm, human eyes.

(CONTINUED)
37
CONTINUED

Roger stares down at them groggily. And, when he finally
speaks, his voice is fragile, and most definitely human:

ROGER
Dorrie?

INT--DORRIE'S CERAMICS SHOP--DAY

FATHER KAYMAN enters a cluttered little shop packed with
ceramics and clay. He waits a moment. Then crosses to a
curtain and peeks through to the WORKSHOP. DORRIE is in
the process of closing the lid to an enormous oven. She
looks up. Sees the Priest. Dorrie removes her HAND MITS
and lifts the VISOR from her face. With. a slight frown.

DORRIE
Let me guess, Father. You want
me to visit my husband.

Kayman seems thrown off by her directness, and doesn't
know what to say. Dorrie takes a seat at a small table;
and, without an express invitation, Kayman does the same.

KAYMAN
Why don't you, Dorrie?

DORRIE
Don, what's the use? Roger is
out cold. He wouldn't know if
I was there or not.

KAYMAN
He's conscious now--for longer
periods of time. And you know
he has asked for you.

DORRIE
He's leaking some kind of fluid.
Brad told me. And you know why
I haven't seen him: because he
asked me to stay away.

KAYMAN
Roger has no lungs. No heart.
His skin has been peeled away,
inch-by-inch. Men have been
christened saints after being
flayed alive. Roger at least
deserves a visit from his wife.

DORRIE
Have you considered minding your
own business?

(CONTINUED)
38

Dorrie reaches for a PACK OF CIGARETTES but Kayman places
his hand over the box. Preventing her from getting one.

KAYMAN

I am aware of what Roger may have
said to you before his operations
began. And I know you didn't ask
for any of this. But I also know
that you're made of sterner stuff.
Will you be able to handle seeing
him? I think so.

DORRIE
Do you know what it's like, being
married to a man like Roger?

KAYMAN
Pretty fine, I would guess. He's
a good man.

DORRIE
He ig. Sometimes, when we're in
bed together, and I'm trying to
sleep, I can hear Roger next to
me. Not moving. Not getting up
to go to the bathroom. Being so
fucking considerate--

Dorrie stops herself before she loses control. Kayman
looks surprised. He takes his hand from the cigarettes.

DORRIE
Did you know that Roger shaves the
minute he gets up, so I won't see
his stubble? Did you know he uses
deodorant, three times a day? My
husband treats me like I'm the Holy
Virgin Mother herself, and has for
the last twelve years.

(escalating in emotion)

Now you come in here and tell me I
ought to go see him--when they're
turning him into something ghastly
and ludicrous? I know I'm making
Roger miserable by not coming to
see him. My god. Don't you think
I know that?

Dorrie lights up a cigarette. Smokes. She calms down.

DORRIE
What you don't seem to understand
is that my going to see him would
make him feel even worse.
39

INT--SPACESUIT FITTING ROOM--DAY

FATHER KAYMAN wriggles into the upper-half of a SPACESUIT
with the name "Kayman" stitched onto the front. It looks
difficult. ASSISTANTS immediately drop the HELMET down
over his head, SNAPPING the latches as they scurry about.

MISSION COMMANDER GODDARD is in his own suit next to the
Priest. "Goddard" stitched on the front. He looks over:

GODDARD
Don't worry, Father. You just get
in that suit, and I'll fly you all
the way to Mars. Deal?

Kayman grimaces as he forces his hand into a GLOVE. He
is about to respond when TWO MILITARY POLICEMEN step up.

MILITARY POLICE 1
Sir. You'll have to come with us.

Kayman looks confused. Then as angry as we've ever seen:

RAYMAN
I just got into this thing!

The Two Military Police stare at him. Their faces stone
cold. Kayman seems to deflate as the Assistants scurry
around him, unsnapping latches to a FSSSSSSSSSHHHHHHHHHH.

INT--LUXURIOUS PRIVATE JET--DAY

The TWO MILITARY POLICEMEN lead FATHER KAYMAN onto a jet
and immediately exit back down the steps. Kayman looks
around. This is one nice airplane. The CURTAIN spreads
as the PRESIDENTIAL AIDE steps into the rear compartment.

AIDE
Please do make yourself at home,
Father. The President will see
you once we're airborne.

CUT TO:

Father Kayman sits in a comfortable-looking seat managing
to look not at all comfortable. He keeps leaning forward
and staring out the window, as if to see what he's flying
over. Suddenly, the CURTAINS SLIDE OPEN BY THEMSELVES.

Kayman hesitates as if waiting for some word. None comes
so he gets up. Steps into the next compartment. TABLES
AS WELL AS CHAIRS here. At one of them sits PRESIDENT
PITZ-JAMES DESHATINE staring blankly out his tiny window.

(CONTINUED)
40
CONTINUED :

DESHATINE
Thanks for letting me kidnap you,
Father. Sit down. Pour yourself
some coffee, if you like.

Kayman sits down, a bit stiff. Doesn't touch the coffee.

KAYMAN
We're just circling the air base,-
aren't we, Mr. President?

DESHATINE
Yes. Just wanted to give us some
privacy while we chatted.

Long pause. The President still staring out the window.
Not moving. Kayman looks uncomfortable Finally reaches
for the COFFEE on the table as the President turns with:

 

DESHATINE
That trampy little wife of his is
going to give our boy a hard time.

Kayman never does pour his coffee. He stiffens. Thinks.

KAYMAN
Sir?

DESHATINE
Dorrie Torraway is sleeping with
Dr. Bradley. I suppose that you
weren't aware of this.

KAYMAN
(surprised)
Uh...no. I--

DESHATINE
(interrupting)
Can you straighten her out, Don?

KAYMAN
I don't-- Dorrie has...problems.

DESHATINE
No, Dorrie has one problem: She
is screwing up our Mars project.

The President looks disappointed. Turns to the window.
Kayman watches him stare morosely at the clouds. Pause.

DESHATINE
Let me tell you, Father, what I've
been thinking lately.

(CONTINUED)
41
CONTINUED:

The President turns toward the Priest. Looking as if the.
fate of the world is weighing down on his two shoulders.

DESHATINE
I've been thinking that Roger will
be happier mourning over the death
of his wife in a car accident than
worrying about what she's doing,
and who she's doing it with, while
he's on a distant planet.

It takes Kayman a few moments to understand what it is
exactly he's just heard. A look of horror on his face:

KAYMAN
Sir. Why would you tell me this?

DESHATINE
Because I want you as my partner
in this particular matter.

KAYMAN
But what can I do? Pray?

DESHATINE
If prayer is all you can offer,
then I want you to pray. Pray
that Mrs. Torraway pulls herself
together long enough to help her
husband. Pray that Roger never
finds out about her infidelity.
And if that doesn't work...then
you'd better start praying real
hard, Father, for the two of us.

INT--A CLINICAL HOSPITAL ROOM--DAY

ROGER rests on a hospital bed. Under crisp new sheets.

He watches the ceiling. There is a RIIIING. Roger turns

toward the bedside table and stares at the TELEPHONE, as

if surprised. It RIIIIIIIINGS again. Roger picks it up:
ROGER

Hel-1o?

INT--ROGER AND DORRIE'S HOME--DAY

DORRIE holds a phone at her ear. Looks off to the side.
DORRIE

Oh, sweetie. It's so nice to hear
your voice again. You sound great.
42

INT--A CLINICAL HOSPITAL ROOM--DAY
ROGER holds the phone at his ear. Looking a bit shaken.

DORRIE (V.0.)
Roger. I'm painting your den. I
was going to paint it in reds and
oranges, but then I figured you'd
- probably be sick of Mars colors.

Roger smiles a little. The door to his room swings open
and a GRIM-LOOKING NURSE marches in. Roger watches her.

ROGER
That's great, honey. Just great.

The Grim Nurse unceremoniously pulls back the bed sheet.
Roger has a hospital gown on, but his legs are exposed.
Encased in those red tiles. Roger's eyes widen as the
Nurse pulls out a tiny HAMMER AND CHISEL from her pocket.
Roger watches her move the tip of the chisel to his thigh
and begin to hammer away with a TONK TONK TONK TONK TONK.

DORRIE (V.0.)
I want to see you, Roger. I'm not
afraid. That's why I called. Not
to tell you about the den. I want
to come see you, okay?

The Grim Nurse finally CHIPS OFF A TILE. Drops it into a
BAG. Roger watches her like he's watching a horror film.

DORRIE (V.O.)
Roger? When can I come?

Roger looks...uncertain. Suddenly he hangs up the phone.

INT--ROGER AND DORRIE'S HOME~-DAY

DORRIE looks about to cry. Hangs up the receiver. She
stares down at it for a moment. Then her eyes move over:

DORRIE
He hung up. Are you satisfied?

FATHER KAYMAN looks just as unhappy against the far wall.
Doesn't say anything. A few uncomfortable moments pass.

DORRIE
I had a telephone call from the
President of the United States
last night telling me how proud
he is I was holding up so well.

(CONTINUED)
43
CONTINUED:

KAYMAN
Oh, That was considerate of him.

DORRIE
Yes. Then he told me not to fuck
anyone until my husband lifts-off
into space. This house is bugged.
And I'm being followed, aren't I?

Kayman does not respond. And Dorrie just gets angrier:

DORRIE
I'm being followed. Aren't I?

KAYMAN
I don't know. Probably. Yes.

Again Dorrie looks about to cry. Turning away from him.

DORRIE
Can I just be left alone now?

Father Kayman watches her, with great sympathy. He nods.

KAYMAN
I hope so.

INT--A CLINICAL HOSPITAL ROOM--DAY

ROGER lies there. His arm outstretched. His hand still
resting on the telephone after hanging it up. He stares
at the ceiling. There is a quick KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK and
the door immediately flies open. SULIE CARPENTER charges
in wearing a nurse's uniform that fits her rather well.
She is striking: Dark hair and green eyes. HAIR AND
EYES JUST LIKE DORRIE'S. Sulie stops beside the bed, and
places a hand on Roger's forehead. He looks surprised.

SULIE
You'd think I'd know better than
feeling for a fever in your case,
sir. I guess I'm an old-fashion-
ed girl. Name's Sulie Carpenter.

Sulie talks in a charming Texas twang. ‘Placing her hand
on her hip, and flashing Roger with her blinding smile:

SULIE
It's Susan Lee, really, but Sulie
is what they call me. Can I bring
you anything, Colonel? You've got
the whole world at your command,
sir. Including me!

(CONTINUED)
44
CONTINUED:

Is Roger listening? Hard to say. He's searching every
inch of her face, clearly seeing the resemblance. Sulie
checks the CHART at the foot of the bed, looking over the
top of the chart at Roger, like a teenager. She GIGGLES.

SULIE
I'm embarrassed to say I used to
have your picture on my wall back
when you rescued those Russians.
(as if humiliated)
Oh...I can't believe I said that.

ROGER
It's okay. Don't be embarrassed.

Sulie covers her face but can't help peeking over at him.

SULIE
You would not believe the active
role you've played in some of my
fantasies, Colonel Torraway, sir!

Roger looks a little shell-shocked. But then he LAUGHS.
And a relieved Sulie does too. She lowers her voice now:

SULIE
Colonel. Can I sneak a camera in
here later and take your picture?
Something to show my future grand-
children when they ask about you?

ROGER
(a bit delighted)
Well, sure, but you know if they
catch you you'll be in hot water.

The door swings open--and SECRET SERVICE PERSONNEL march
in holding ELECTRONIC SCANNING DEVICES. Immediately they
circle the room, scanning the walls and furniture. Roger
looks at Sulie, who shrugs like she doesn't know a thing.

SULIE
(almost a whisper)
Guess I'll see you later.

Sulie turns, and exits. Roger watches the Secret Service
Personnel moving around the hospital room. Faces stone.
They reach the bed. Scanning both it and Roger's body.

ROGER
Something tells me I'm getting a
visit from the President.
The Secret Service Personnel stop, and stare at Roger for
(CONTINUED)
45
CONTINUED :

a moment, as if only now realizing Roger is there on the
bed. Without a word, they turn and continue their work.

EXT--ROGER AND DORRIE'S HOME--DAY

BRADLEY crouches in BUSHES ACROSS THE STREET. Watching
FATHER KAYMAN get into his car. After a moment, Kayman
drives away. Bradley watches the car round the corner,
finally out of sight. The street is free of parked cars.
There are no pedestrians. Nothing in either direction.
Bradley waits. Looks both ways. Finally he emerges from
the bushes and starts across the street. Not running but
not wanting to linger, either. He turns at the SCREECH:

A DARK SEDAN rounds the corner and, a moment later, a
DARK VAN rounds the other. Both vehicles racing down the
street, their DARKENED WINDOWS quite ominous, stopping in
front of Roger and Dorrie's home, trapping the helpless
Bradley between them, stuck in the middle of the street.
The van door immediately slides open and TWO LARGE GRIM
MEN IN SUITS emerge. They take Bradley by the arms and
pull him inside. Bradley goes limp, like a big rag doll.

The vehicles immediately drive off in opposite directions
and, in just a moment, the street is deserted once again.

INT--A CLINICAL HOSPITAL ROOM--DAY

ROGER watches the SECRET SERVICE PERSONNEL complete their
rounds, and immediately exit. Roger watches the door for
a moment; but when nothing happens he lets his head fall
back onto his pillow. And that's when he hears the KLIK:

PRESIDENT DESHATINE is standing outside in the hall, with
his heading sticking through the door. Smiling at Roger.

DESHATINE
Mind if I come in, son?

Before Roger can answer the President steps right inside,
holding up the PACKAGE in his hand so that Roger can see:

DESHATINE
Talked to Dorrie the other day. TI
told her I was planning to pay you
a visit, and she asked me to bring
this to you. Sweet, sweet woman.

Deshatine lays it on the table. Pulls up a chair. Sits.

DESHATINE
How are you feeling, Rog?

(CONTINUED)
46
CONTINUED :

ROGER
Uh. Fine, sir. Okay.

The President scoots his chair even closer. Leans over:

DESHATINE

I can be honest with you, Colonel.
The Asians are close; but I think
we still have the edge on them if
we can make that September launch
date. If not, we'll have to wait
another 26 months and by then the
Asians will be ready too and Mars
will be up for grabs. We have to
get you on Mars now, and you have
to function when you get there.

The President gently lays a hand on Roger's arm. Roger
looks at the hand a moment. Then back at the President.

DESHATINE

Do you understand me, in your gut,
son? Do you really feel that you
are that one man in a generation
--maybe two--who finds himself in
a position so vital to the future
of the human race that nothing in
his life comes close to measuring
up in importance?

The President grabs a PITCHER OF WATER. Pours a glass.
He brings it toward his lips; but the glass stops on its
way there as Deshatine instead starts gesturing with it:

DESHATINE

Do you know what history will say
about me? "Fitz-James Deshatine,
54th President--during his tenure
the human race founded its first

colony on another world." That's
all I'll get, if that much. That
is what posterity will remember.

Not the petty daily bullshit, not
the interchangeable little wars I
ean't even keep straight myself.

(short pause)

Human destiny, my boy. That's my
interest here, not keeping things
running along the same old status
quo. Mars will change the course
of history. The universe is just
waiting for us. And you, Roger,

are the one who can give me this.
You can give humanity its future.

(CONTINUED)
47
CONTINUED :

The President never does take a drink of water. Stares
at the glass in his hand like he forgot it was there, and
lays it back on the table. He looks at Roger and frowns.

DESHATINE
I know what you're thinking, Rog.
Here's the old man, politician to
the end, he'd say anything to get
what he wants. He'll tell me I'm
the next Jesus Christ. Right?

ROGER
Well. Maybe a little. Yes, sir.

Deshatine squeezes Roger's arm one last time. Stands up.

DESHATINE .
I'll tell you what, Colonel. Go
ahead and subtract 99% of what I
just said as crap. The one per-
cent that's left still makes you
the most important person in the
world right now.

The President moves to the door. Opens it. Hesitates.
DESHATINE
If you need anything, you call me,
night or day--I'll make sure they
put you through. So long.

The President exits. Roger watches the door swing shut.

INT--STERILE COMPLEX CORRIDOR--DAY

STUNNED NURSES AND DOCTORS stare with open mouths as the
PRESIDENT marches down the corridor surrounded by SECRET
SERVICE AGENTS. The PRESIDENTIAL AIDE hands him a PHONE:

AIDE
I dialed for you, Mr. President.

Deshatine looks irritated. Brings the phone to his ear.

INT--INSIDE THE BACK OF A VAN--DAY

BRADLEY sits between TWO LARGE GRIM MEN. TWO MORE GRIM
MEN across from him. RING. One man picks up the PHONE.
He doesn't answer hello. Just offers it to Bradley with:

GRIM MAN 1
It's for you.

(CONTINUED)
48
CONTINUED :

Bradley brings the receiver to his ear, like he's holding
a gun to his head. It takes him a moment to finally ask:

BRADLEY
H-hello?

INT--A CLINICAL HOSPITAL ROOM--DAY

The door opens again, and SULIE steps back inside, with a
PICTURE FRAME in her hand. She holds it out so ROGER can
see the AUTOGRAPHED PHOTO OF THE PRESIDENT. Sulie reads:

SULIE
"For Rog, from his pal, President
Fitz-James Deshatine."
(short pause)
Do you want this, Colonel?

ROGER
Why not. Can you hang it up?

Sulie turns it over revealing a METALLIC GADGET on back.

SULIE
All presidential photos come with
this self-hanging gizmo. See?

Sulie presses the frame to an empty spot on the wall, and
it sticks. Then she steps back to the door and opens it.
Looks up and down the hall, checking to see if the coast
is clear. Sulie turns. Pulls a CAMERA from her pocket.

She hurriedly sets the camera on a tabletop at the foot
of the bed. Fumbling with the timer. Nervous. Like a
little girl might get nervous. GIGGLING. The TICKING OF
THE TIMER seems to surprise her, and her expression turns
suddenly frantic. Sulie runs around the side of the bed:

SULIE
Hurry up and smile, Colonel!

Sulie plants a kiss on a surprised Roger's cheek in time
for the bright FLASH. She quickly retrieves the camera
and sticks it back into her uniform. Looking relieved.

ROGER
Sulie. You can call me "Roger."

Sulie stares at Roger. As if she is genuinely touched.

SULIE
I better go now...Roger. But I'll
check on you in the morning, okay?

(CONTINUED)
49
CONTINUED:

Sulie opens the door. Looks back one last time, almost
shyly, and exits. Roger just sits there for a moment.
Then turns to that package the President brought him. He
takes the box and lifts the lid. Inside is a CERAMIC CUP
decorated with a cornucopia of fruits. Roger appears to
like it, opening the card: "I LOVE YOU," signed, Zaezsue.

Roger lets his head fall onto his pillow. And he smiles.

INT--THRU STERILE CORRIDORS-~-MONTAGE

ROGER steps from his hospital room. His expression is so
tentative this must be his first time, holding on to his
METAL WALKER like a life preserver. TWO MALE NURSES walk
behind him with SULIE at his side mouthing encouragement.

Roger leaves his room again and again. A little surer
each time. And now, with a CANE in place of the walker.
Then holding on only to Sulie for support. Finally Roger
walks down the hall UNAIDED as the NURSES CLAP AND CHEER.

INT--PHYSICAL TRAINING FACILITY--DAY

ROGER is led by a DOCTOR into a gym. Inside is a FORMER
PARAPLEGIC wearing gym shorts that reveal his ARTIFICIAL
LEGS. He offers Roger a friendly smile and a handshake.

DOCTOR
Roger, meet Charlie. Charlie is a
former paraplegic whose artificial
legs are precursors of your own.

Roger takes his hand. They look over each other's legs.

INT--THE TRAINING FACILITY --MONTAGE

ROGER and the FORMER PARAPLEGIC work out on TREADMILLS.
Then run TRACK. The Former Paraplegic obviously faster
and more co-ordinated. Egging the frustrated Roger on.
They JUMP ROPE. Perform BALLET MOVES as SULIE watches
with a grin. Slowly, Roger gets FASTER ON THE JUMP ROPE.
Finally he races past the Former Paraplegic, who seems to
be almost standing still in comparison...and who ends up
stopping and just watching Roger speed around the track.

INT--OPTICAL EXAMINATION ROOM--DAY

ROGER is led by a DOCTOR into an eye examination facility
where a FORMER BLIND MAN immediately turns revealing his
eye sockets, and his PAIR OF PRIMITIVE ARTIFICIAL LENSES.

(CONTINUED)
50
CONTINUED :

DOCTOR
This is Frederick, Roger. Once
upon a time he was blind.

Beneath his mechanical eyes, the Former Blind Man smiles.
CUT TO:

CLOSE-UP of Roger's INNER METALLIC EYELIDS closing over
his human eyes. There is a WHIRRING and, when they open,
Roger is looking out with his set of RED GLOWING LENSES.

SULIE walks in. She sees Roger and the Former Blind Man
on the far side of the room. She stops. About to speak.

ROGER'S P.0.V.. Sulie standing there looking good in her
white nurse's uniform. Suddenly the UNIFORM FADES and
Sulie is briefly seen NAKED before her skin fades too
revealing the RED MUSCLE AND VEINS underneath. A moment
later she is just a HUMAN SKELETON standing in front of
an UNFINISHED SECTION OF WALL exposing the world OUTSIDE.

Roger jerks. Shocked. Like he hadn't expected that. He
closes his eyes and, when he opens them, they are HUMAN
again. The Former Blind Man GUFFAWS wildly in amusement.

Sulie frowns like she doesn't get it. Hands on her hips:

SULIE
What?

INT--MARS NORMAL TANK--DAY

ROGER appears to be running across the barren surface of
Mars. Dressed only in an astronaut's JUMPSUIT. Leaping
gracefully over the FAKE MARTIAN BOULDERS. He runs past
a WINDOW. SULIE and FATHER KAYMAN are visible, watching.

INT--OBSERVATION BOOTH--DAY

SULIE and FATHER KAYMAN watch from the other side of the
thick glass. ROGER climbs a ladder to a FAKE MARS LANDER
with four spider-like legs planted into the red soil.
Suddenly, Sulie leans forward. Like she sees something.
Sulie bolts from the booth, and a curious Kayman follows.

INT--MARS TANK AIRLOCK-~-DAY

SULIE rushes down the hall to the Mars tank airlock. TWO
TECHNICIANS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUITS are about to close the
thick round OUTER DOOR. The Technicians look surprised

(CONTINUED)
51
CONTINUED :

as Sulie rushes up with FATHER KAYMAN right behind her.

SULIE
(authoritatively)
Gentlemen, I think you two going
in there wearing those suits will
only remind the Colonel that he
no longer requires air to breathe.
(and now, softer)
And we don't need that, do we?

The Two Technicians stare at Sulie through their visors.
They share a brief glance, and move out of the airlock.
Sulie steps back. Looking relieved. Father Kayman seems
a little surprised by Sulie. But very pleased. He nods.

KAYMAN
Good thinking, nurse.

INT--A CLINICAL HOSPITAL ROOM--MONTAGE

SULIE enters Roger's hospital room. Again and again and
again. Always greeting ROGER with her bubbly enthusiasm.
Very endearing. She brings FLOWERS to brighten up the
room, Replaces the blinds with COLORFUL DRAPERY. They
watch TELEVISION. She opens his MAIL, unfolding a KID'S
DRAWING OF AN ASTRONAUT IN A SPACESUIT. They both laugh.

INT--CYBORG-ROBOTICS LABORATORY--DAY

A lab stuffed with robotic parts. ROGER and SULIE watch
a ROBOTICS SPECIALIST work a CONTROL PANEL. What looks
like a tangled TV antenna suddenly opens up forming a
SKELETAL PAIR OF WINGS. It looks like the sub-structure
of what will eventually be an enormous pair of bat wings.
Roger and Sulie look surprised as the metal framework
stretches all the way across the lab. From wall to wall.

SPECIALIST
(matter-of-factly)
We plan on attaching these wings
to your shoulders. They'll act
like a pair of solar panels, and
power your internal batteries--

The Specialist stops when he sees the pained expression
forming on Roger's face. Like that is going to be on me?

The Robotics Specialist is at a loss. He seems to search

for the right words to say...but is saved by Sulie, who
Places a gentle hand on Roger's shoulder and leans close.

(CONTINUED)
52
CONTINUED:

SULIE
(sounding genuine)
Oh, Roger. You're going to be so
beautiful. Like a bird!

Roger looks at her. Not quite convinced. But after a
few moments of staring at Sulie, Roger returns her smile.

INT--OBSERVATION BOOTH--DAY

FATHER KAYMAN stands in front of the thick glass watching
ROGER inside the Mars normal tank. Roger is BALANCING ON
ONE FINGER. Legs in the air. Not swaying an inch. Just
perfectly balanced on one finger. The door opens, and
SULIE walks in. She steps beside Kayman. Watches Roger.

SULIE
Morning, Father. How's he doing?

KAYMAN
Look at him. I'd say he's doing
just great--and this is due in no
small part to you, Sulie. You've
been terrific for him. I mean it.

Sulie smiles gratefully. But it passes rather quickly as
she stares through the glass. She looks a bit worn out.

SULIE
I really envy you. The reason I
joined the space program to begin
with was to be the first woman to
set foot on another world.

Father Kayman looks at Sulie, with the proper sympathy.
But then he notices something about her face. Like he
can't tell what it is. When Sulie turns, he looks away.

SULIE
Women pilot the shuttle, and walk
on the moon; but when it comes to
Mars--when it comes to the heavy,
exploratory missions--it is still
the men who get the glory.

KAYMAN
I suspect the public needs time
to get used to the idea of sending
a woman 250-million miles away.

SULIE
Well. At least I can do my part
to help Roger. That's important.

(CONTINUED)
53
CONTINUED :

KAYMAN
You don't sound too convin--

Kayman stops. As if realizing what's been bothering him:

KAYMAN
Your eyes. They're brown today.

ROGER'S VOICE
(over the speaker)
Balance the locks--I'm coming out.

Sulie and Kayman turn. In the Mars tank, Roger rights
himself. Heads toward the airlock. Sulie looks frantic.

SULIE
Shit, I don't have my contacts in!

Sulie bolts from the room, as if this is tantamount to an
emergency. Father Kayman stares after her, with a frown.

INT--MARS PROJECT PRESS HALL--NIGHT

The CREW OF THE FIRST MARS MISSION stands in front of a
backdrop featuring the PLANET MARS and MISSION INSIGNIA.
ROGER, FATHER KAYMAN, DR. BRADLEY, COMMANDER GODDARD, and
the FIFTH MEMBER of the crew pose for the cameras, and
look as comfortable as they can inside their spacesuits.

FLASHBULBS are in a frenzy as the PHOTOGRAPHERS wrestle
for position. REPORTERS attempt to ask their questions,
and the quickest one gets most of his sentence out first:

REPORTER 1
Aren't any of you worried about the
effects of long-term weightlessness
during a sixth-month space flight?

Goddard gestures to the MOTORIZED MODEL OF THE MARS SPACE
CRAFT. It looks like two Apollo modules connected by a
tether line. The two capsules ROTATE around one another.

GODDARD

As you can see from the model, the
command module and final booster
rocket remain connected by a mile-
long metal tether. The rotation
of the craft creates an artificial
gravity on either end to alleviate
the weightlessness of space.

Goddard leans forward in his suit and turns toward Father
Kayman. The Priest immediately taking up the discussion.

KAYMAN

The artificial gravity inside the
ship will be equivalent to around
forty-percent of Earth's gravity,
which just happens to approximate
the strength of Mars' own gravity.
So, we should be quite acclimated
to conditions on Mars by the time
we arrive on the surface.

GODDARD
And with four hours of exercise
a day, the trip should offer us
no ill effects. Next question?

The Mars crew smiles earnestly. One voice rises higher:

REPORTER 2
Colonel Torraway, have you decided
what you'll say as you descend to
the surface, the first human being
to set foot on Mars?

ROGER
Yes, sir. I certainly have.

Roger grins. Clearly not intending to respond further.
The Reporters and the rest of the Crew LAUGH pleasantly.

INT--CREW WIVES' PRESS HALL--NIGHT

The WIVES OF THE MARS CREW sit behind a long table in a
hall that is quite a bit smaller. The group of REPORTERS
interviewing them is smaller too, but just as. attentive
as their counterparts. DORRIE seems uneasy, but does her
best to look earnest as Another Wife finishes a response:

OTHER WIFE
(almost by rote)
...and I know I speak for all of
us here when I say that we wives
are so pleased and proud to be a
part of history in the making.

Dorrie fights to keep her smile as the FLASHBULBS go off.

INT--NARROW ACCESS CORRIDOR--NIGHT

The MARS CREW marches from the press hall into a narrow
access corridor. They look tired but relieved, trudging
along one after another, the corridor just wide enough to
accommodate their spacesuits. ROGER brings up the rear.

(CONTINUED)
55
CONTINUED :

He lays a gloved hand on FATHER KAYMAN to make him stop.

ROGER
(whispering)
Do you think Dorrie's still here?

Kayman waits a moment to allow the others to walk ahead.

KAYMAN
You want to see her?

ROGER
I think I'm ready, Don. I think
I can handle it now.

Kayman stares at Roger a brief moment. Then smiles wide:

KAYMAN
I think so, too--and that's why
I already set up a meeting, Rog.

Up ahead in the line, BRADLEY turns a little. Notices
that Roger and Kayman have stopped. He looks interested.

Roger squeezes Kayman's shoulder, warmly. They walk on.

INT--COLD METALLIC ELEVATOR--NIGHT

DORRIE rides an elevator. Nervously. Taking a CIGARETTE
from her purse, but then hesitating, and dropping it back
inside. Putting on a determined face. At the sound of
the DING, Dorrie instinctively moves over to make room.

SULIE steps on, offering Dorrie a perfunctory nod--until
she realizes who this woman actually is. Sulie steps
quickly to the side. Turning away. Hitting the button.

They ride in silence...with essentially the same hair and
the same color eyes. They really do look alike. Sulie
trying to stare off to the side, without being too
obvious about it. Dorrie trying to get a good look at
her, without seeming like she's doing it. Moments pass.
Dorrie leaning forward. Sulie turning more to the side.

There is another DING. Sulie squeezes through the doors
as soon. as they open wide enough, and rushes down the
hall. Dorrie watches her go as the elevator slides shut.

INT--PRIVATE DRESSING ROOM--NIGHT

ROGER pulls up the zipper to his jumpsuit. Underneath
he's wearing a turtleneck that stops just under his chin.

(CONTINUED)
56
CONTINUED:

Roger pulls his sleeves down so they hide the RED TILES
on his wrists. With only his face and hands exposed,
Roger can easily pass as "normal." He checks the mirror.

INT--NONDESCRIPT CORRIDOR--NIGHT

FATHER KAYMAN waits. At the end of the hall, an elevator
opens and DORRIE steps out. The Priest walks to meet her
but neither greets the other. They start down the hall.

KAYMAN
You'll be so proud of Roger when
you see him, Dorrie.

DORRIE
I've always been proud, Don.

Kayman gives up trying to talk. They stop. Open a door.

INT--SMALL CONFERENCE ROOM--NIGHT

DORRIE steps inside, and looks around. Just an average
meeting room with a table and chairs. Dorrie puts her
purse down on the table. FATHER KAYMAN hovers inside the
doorway. As if he doesn't quite know what to do or say.

He starts to go. But before the door closes all the way:

DORRIE
Thank you, Father.

Kayman looks at Dorrie a moment. Then leaves her alone.

INT--NONDESCRIPT CORRIDOR- -NIGHT

ROGER walks down a corridor, and stops at the elevator.
He presses the button. Waits. Looks nervous. He checks
his jumpsuit, shifting the position of the zipper a bit.
He runs his hand through his hair. Roger seems to think
about his hair. Then he steps down the hall to a door.

INT--NONDESCRIPT RESTROOM--NIGHT

ROGER steps in front of the mirror. His hair is in place
but he takes out a COMB, and runs it through a few times,
anyway. Seems satisfied. A bit surprised at the FLUSH.

One of the bathroom stalls opens, and a REPORTER emerges.
The Reporter freezes, sees Roger, and immediately becomes
animated. He rushes forward as Roger heads for the door.

(CONTINUED)
57
CONTINUED :

REPORTER 3
Colonel! Maybe you remember me
from the press conference. Fred
Thomas, Associated News. Can I
ask you a couple more questions?

ROGER
I'm sorry. I think we answered
ever conceivable ques--

Roger almost reaches the exit. But the Reporter quickly
squeezes between him and the door with dogged enthusiasm.

INT--NONDESCRIPT CORRIDOR- -NIGHT

FATHER KAYMAN rounds the corner, as if looking for Roger.
He passes the elevator Roger summoned moments ago. There
is a DING as the doors slide open. Kayman stops, staring
at the empty elevator. Behind him, SULIE crosses the
corridor. She sees Kayman, and hesitates. Stepping up.
Clicking on that sweet-natured, Texas school-girl charm:

SULIE
Father. I hear you really wowed
‘em tonight!

KAYMAN

Oh, hello, Sulie. I don't know.
But thank you, anyway.

Sulie smiles. But seems to give him the once-over, too.

SULIE
I think I just saw Roger's wife
a minute ago.

KAYMAN
I've arranged a meeting between
them. But shhhh. No one knows.

Sulie nods. But when Kayman turns away her face hardens:

SULIE
(not quite casual)
Oh.

INT--SMALL CONFERENCE ROOM--NIGHT

DORRIE paces. Like this waiting is getting to her. She
pulls out a chair, and sits down. Just then BRIGHT LIGHT
from the hall fills the room with the SHADOW OF A MAN
sneaking quickly inside. Dorrie stands and turns around.

(CONTINUED)
58
CONTINUED :

DORRIE
Rog--

Dorrie stops. BRADLEY stands with his back flat against
the door. Like he knows he's somewhere he shouldn't be.

INT--NONDESCRIPT RESTROOM- -NIGHT
ROGER tries to get past the dogged REPORTER. But fails.

REPORTER 3
Just one question, Colonel. One.

Roger has little choice, unless he wants to physically
remove the Reporter from the door. He resigns himself.

ROGER
All right. Just one.

The Reporter looks like a kid in a candy store...until
his face loses all expression:

REPORTER 3
What's...that?

Roger frowns. Like he doesn't get the question. What he
hasn't realized yet is that MILKY FLUID has begun to LEAK
FROM HIS NOSE. His EARS. From the CORNERS OF HIS MOUTH.
Roger instinctively brings his hands toward his face and
sees the FLUID LEAKING FROM HIS FINGERTIPS. Roger looks
stunned. Starts to back away when his body jerks with a
violent spasm. MILKY FLUID SPURTS FROM HIS MOUTH AND
SPLATTERS THE FACE of the terrified Reporter who SCREAMS.

INT--NONDESCRIPT CORRIDOR-~-NIGHT

FATHER KAYMAN and SULIE turn at the sound of the SCREAM.

INT--NONDESCRIPT RESTROOM- -NIGHT

ROGER backs away from the REPORTER. FLUID RUSHING DOWN
HIS FACE, as if spilling out from every pore on his body.

REPORTER 3
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU?!
INT--NONDESCRIPT CORRIDOR--NIGHT

FATHER KAYMAN and SULIE start moving down the corridor.
Not knowing where to go, but moving faster. Running now.
59

INT--NONDESCRIPT RESTROOM--NIGHT

ROGER turns. Sees a tiny restroom WINDOW. Roger runs at
the wall and LEAPS. He bursts through the window--much
too small for him--and TAKES OUT MOST OF THE WALL. The
stunned REPORTER stares at the ENORMOUS HOLE. Wide-eyed.

EXT--OVER 20 STORIES HIGH--NIGHT

ROGER bursts through the outside wall and keeps going
after the RUBBLE around him has already arched toward the
ground. It almost looks like Roger is floating. Until
gravity takes over and his body plummets wildly toward
the Earth, past the BLURRED BUILDING LIGHTS behind him.

INT--NONDESCRIPT RESTROOM--NIGHT

The door flies open and SULIE rushes in followed a moment
later by FATHER KAYMAN. They see the jagged hole in the
wall. The Priest can only stare at the gaping hole. But
Sulie immediately turns toward the frightened REPORTER as
the newsman attempts to run past them into the corridor.

REPORTER 3
LET ME OUTTA HERE!!!

Sulie grabs the Reporter and throws him across the room.

EXT--HITTING THE PAVEMENT--NIGHT

ROGER tumbles and spins and manages to right himself just
before he strikes the pavement sending CHUNKS OF CONCRETE
AND DIRT HIGH INTO THE AIR. There is a deafening DOOOOM.

INT--NONDESCRIPT RESTROOM--NIGHT

SULIE lands a martial arts blow to the REPORTER that
leaves him dazed. She follows with a perfectly-executed
spinning kick that sends the unconscious Reporter sliding
limply across the floor as FATHER KAYMAN looks on in
amazement. Sulie marches toward the hole in the wall,
stepping over the body of the Reporter like it's nothing.
Kayman rushes to his side. Kneels. Feels for a pulse.

KAYMAN
My god. What have you done?

Sulie places her hands on the jagged concrete and looks.

SULIE'S P.O.V. Looking down, over twenty stories: It is

60
CONTINUED :
dark. But the dim lights from the building offer enough

illumination to see CRACKED PAVEMENT AND A DEEP HOLE IN
THE GROUND. But that is all. There is no sign of Roger.

Sulie turns to consider Kayman standing over the body of
the Reporter as MILITARY POLICEMEN rush through the door.

Sulie's demeanor is different here. We've never seen her
like this before: Her face is heavy with responsibility.
And her voice is MINUS THE TEXAS ACCENT. Authoritative.

SULIE
Take the one lying on the floor
into custody.

MILITARY POLICE 1
Yes, Major.

The Military Policemen bend to retrieve the body. Kayman
frowns. He stares acidly at Sulie. She holds his gaze.

KAYMAN
(as if condemning her)
Nice to meet you, Major.

INT--SMALL CONFERENCE ROOM--NIGHT

BRADLEY tries to approach DORRIE but she backs around the
long table. Gesturing for Bradley to keep his distance:

DORRIE
Get out of here, Brad. Roger will
be here any minute.

BRADLEY
It's been terrible not being able
to see you, Dorrie.

DORRIE
We don't have a choice. Now, go.

BRADLEY
Just tell me that you miss me too.

DORRIE
(just because she has to)
I miss you. I miss you. NOW GO!

EXT--OUTSIDE THE COMPLEX--NIGHT

SULIE steps up. Looks down into the HOLE IN THE PAVEMENT
as MORE MILITARY POLICEMEN climb on out, covered in dirt.

(CONTINUED)
61
CONTINUED:

SULIE
Tell me he's not buried in there.

MILITARY POLICE 2
Not as far as we can tell.

SULIE
(not at all happy)
Get some shovels...and make sure.

INT--SMALL CONFERENCE ROOM--NIGHT

BRADLEY backs DORRIE into the corner, trying to hold her.
She slaps first one hand away, then the other, before she
simply weakens. Bradley takes her, and pulls her close.

The DOOR SWINGS OPEN. They both turn...and look relieved
as FATHER KAYMAN enters. The Priest sees Bradley there,
clearly not approving, but does not address him directly:

KAYMAN
(to Dorrie)
Roger was found out by a reporter.
I'm afraid he's fled.

DORRIE
What? Fled to where?

KAYMAN
I was hoping he came here to see
you but thank God that he didn't.
(to Bradley now)
You're a damned fool.

DORRIE
What should I do, Don?

KAYMAN
If Roger has left the compound,
there's a good chance he'll go
home--and if he does you should
be there to meet him.

Dorrie thinks it over, and nods. Kayman opens the door:

KAYMAN
Don't take too long.

Kayman exits. Dorrie offers Bradley a sidelong glance,
moving past him, toward the table, to retrieve her purse.

BRADLEY
Dorrie--

(CONTINUED)
62
CONTINUED:

DORRIE
(interrupting)
Look, we had fun, Brad. And we're
lucky we can end it now before any
real damage was done--before Roger
found out. Now let's say good-bye.

Dorrie turns to face Bradley. Extends both of her hands:

DORRIE
Just say it. Good-bye.

Bradley stares into her eyes. Finally, takes her hands.
cuT TO:

DORRIE AND BRADLEY ARE SKELETONS. Human skeletons that
are somehow upright. Holding hands and talking inside an
UNFINISHED BUILDING next to wall supports and conduits.
EXT--OUTSIDE OF THE COMPLEX--NIGHT

ROGER watches them with GLOWING LENSES where his human
eyes should be. One side of his face is ripped and the
SKIN HANGS DOWN but there is no blood. What's underneath
looks like PLASTIC. DRIED MILKY FLUID on his face and on

his jumpsuit. He doesn't move. Crouches in the bushes.
The lenses of his artificial eyes GLOW RED in the dark.

EXT--THE COMPOUND PERIMETER--NIGHT
A TALL IMPOSING FENCE surrounds the buildings of the Man
Plus facility in the distance. FOOTSTEPS. ROGER HURDLES
THE FENCE. Just a blur. Hitting the ground and running.
EXT--A CROWDED SUPER-HIGHWAY--NIGHT

Rows of cars. ROGER HURDLES THE HIGHWAY. Just a blur.

EXT--ROGER AND DORRIE'S HOME--NIGHT

The SOUND OF CRACKING TIMBER. Getting louder. Louder.
ROGER bursts through the trees and lands in the backyard.

INT--ROGER AND DORRIE'S HOME--NIGHT

Looking out through a GLASS DOOR onto their yard: ROGER
walks closer. His eyes RED GLOWING LENSES. FACE TORN.
His RIPPED JUMPSUIT revealing the TILES he uses for skin.

(CONTINUED)
63
CONTINUED :

Roger steps up to the sliding glass door...and casually
WALKS THROUGH IT. Like he doesn't even notice it. The
door SHATTERS, a shower of broken glass falling like snow
at his feet. Roger steps into the room, and takes a seat
in a cushioned chair. His TWO LENSES GLOW in the dark.

EXT--ROGER AND DORRIE'S HOME--NIGHT

A MILITARY CAR pulls up, and DORRIE gets out. She looks
up and down the block. BLACK SEDANS litter the street.
Rather ominous. Dorrie turns and walks toward the house.

INT--ROGER AND DORRIE'S HOME--NIGHT

DORRIE enters the kitchen. Turns on a set of lights that
illuminate the counter. She sets her purse down, resting
there a moment. Then she lifts a TEA KETTLE. Fills it
with water. Turns on the burner. Dorrie walks into the
family room--and stops as she sees the broken glass door.

Dorrie spins. Sees ROGER in that chair and she SCREAMS.
Dorrie stumbles back against the wall. Grabbing for a
handhold. Her eyes squeezed shut. When she opens them:

DORRIE'S P.O.V. Roger stands up. His SKIN HANGING FROM
HIS RIPPED FACE. Jumpsuit torn REVEALING HIS BODY. His
EYES GLOWING. It is frightening. Roger closes his eyes
with a WHIRRING and, when he opens them, they're normal.

ROGER
Sorry. Forgot about my eyes.

The TELEPHONE RINGS. They both turn. Look at the phone.

ROGER
That will be them, I'd think.

Roger steps casually to the telephone. He doesn't appear
angry, or upset. But in place of lifting the receiver
Roger instead CRUSHES THE TELEPHONE. Dorrie jumps as
Roger grinds part of the phone to POWDER. Then he turns:

ROGER
Have a seat, dear. I'd like to
speak with you about something.

INT--STERILE COMPLEX CORRIDOR--NIGHT

SULIE moves quickly down a clinical corridor looking like
the nurse she always seemed to be. Flashing a big Texas
smile at some DOCTORS she passes. Sulie stops at a door.

(CONTINUED)
64
CONTINUED:

It is marked: "ADMINISTRATIVE STATISTICS." She KNOCKS.
The SPY-HOLE slides open, An EYE peeks out. Immediately
the spy-hole slides shut and after a KLAK the door opens.

INT--ADMINISTRATIVE STATISTICS--NIGHT

SULIE steps in, and her demeanor changes. From girlish
and pleasant to downright irritated. She carries herself
with authority, nodding curtly at the MEN AND WOMEN WHO
LOOK LIKE FBI seated at their rolltop desks. Their desks
are open now revealing VIDEO AND SURVEILLANCE EQUIPMENT.

An inner door SLIDES OPEN and Sulie steps inside a small
ANTECHAMBER. Waits. After a moment, a SECOND DOOR OPENS
and Sulie enters what looks like a THINK TANK: the walls
on all sides are ENORMOUS VIDEO SCREENS DISPLAYING ROGER
AND DORRIE in their home. Roger crushing the phone with:

ROGER
(coming over speakers)
Have a seat, dear. I'd like to
speak with you about something.

Sulie steps up in front of an IMPOSING TABLE, and snaps
to attention. A GRIM PANEL OF MEN AND WOMEN stare at her
with less-than-pleased expressions. The CENTER MAN says:

CENTER MAN
Major. Take one moment to collect
your thoughts; then please recount
for us the events of the last few
hours, adding your recommendations
for getting us out of this mess--a
mess, we might add, that you were
brought in to ensure we avoid....

Sulie stands at attention. Her face hardens even more.

INT--ROGER AND DORRIE'S HOME--NIGHT

DORRIE lowers herself stiffly into a high-backed chair.
ROGER maneuvers himself so that he is behind it, out of
her line of sight. For a moment Dorrie tries to see him.

ROGER
Don't...look at me.

Dorrie stops trying to see him. Sits back in her chair.

DORRIE
I'm sorry I screamed like that. It
was just that you surprised me.

(CONTINUED)
65
CONTINUED:

Long pause. Roger just stares at the back of her chair.

DORRIE

The President says you're carrying
the fate of the human race on your
back. Half of everything that man
says is a lie. But I don't think
that is. You're a significant man,
Rog. You were always a famous one,
and maybe that's why I married you.
It was like being with a rock star.
But you could always walk away, if
you wanted to. This I don't think
you're going to walk away from.

The WHISTLE OF A BOILING KETTLE invades the room. Roger
doesn't move. Just stares at the high back of her chair.

ROGER
(so subdued it's spooky)
Why don't you go and get your tea.

INT--ADMINISTRATIVE STATISTICS--NIGHT

SULIE stands in front of that PANEL OF GRIM MEN AND WOMEN
as the screens covering the walls display DORRIE GETTING
UP AND WALKING INTO THE KITCHEN. Nervously MAKING TEA.
These shots are unusual, as if taken from hidden cameras.

SULIE
Father Kayman is a friend of his.
I suggest we send him in to bring
Colonel Torraway back.

A DISAGREEING MAN at the end of the table leans forward:
DISAGREEING MAN

We have over two dozen agents on
the street--why not send them in?

SULIE
That would not be a particularly
good idea.

CENTER MAN

You are not too popular with this
panel right now, Major.

SULIE
Be that as it may, the Colonel is
still relatively stable. Ordering
in agents will only aggravate the
situation. Send the Priest. Now.
66

EXT--OUTSIDE OF THE COMPLEX--NIGHT

FATHER KAYMAN rushes outside toward a CONSERVATIVE CAR.
Not sporty. Like a priest might drive. He gets inside:

KAYMAN
Manual.

Kayman puts his hands on the wheel...but nothing happens.
There is no roar from the engine. Kayman looks confused.
Suddenly a MECHANICAL VOICE emanates from the car itself:

MECHANICAL VOICE
Your voice registers a high degree
of stress, Father Kayman.

The Priest sits there for a moment. Trying to calm down:

KAYMAN
I'm...fine. I would like to drive
manually, please.

Long pause. The Priest sits there, as if afraid to move.
Face straining with the effort of not appearing strained.
Finally, a BREATHALYZER UNIT DROPS DOWN FROM THE CEILING.

MECHANICAL VOICE
Please breathe into this unit--to
verify that you are not under the
influence of alcohol.

Kayman grabs the device, and furiously breathes into it.
The ENGINE ROARS. The Priest grabs the wheel, floors the
gas pedal, and the car SCREECHES through the parking lot.

INT--ROGER AND DORRIE'S HOME--NIGHT

ROGER watches DORRIE as she re-enters the room holding a
delicate TEA CUP AND SAUCER. She does not look at Roger.
Immediately moving back to her chair. Sitting, stiffly.

DORRIE
So what do you want to talk about?

ROGER
Bradley.

The cup in Dorrie's hand begins to CLATTER on the saucer.
She quickly lifts the cup from the saucer to stop it, her
eyes making it clear that Dorrie is thinking furiously:

DORRIE
What about Bradley?

(CONTINUED)
67
CONTINUED :

ROGER
You slept with him.

Dorrie seems to deflate. She sets the cup back onto the
saucer, oblivious to the fact that it's CLATTERING again.
She stares straight ahead. Looking absolutely wretched:

DORRIE

I don't know how to deal with you.
Are you angry with me? You don't
sound upset. But then again, you
never do. I don't think you have
raised your voice in the last ten
years. A wife should be grateful
for having a husband like that...
but the truth is, after you saved
those stupid Russians, and became
a hero, and were told you'd never
fly on another mission, something
went and died inside of you. And
it's stayed dead ever since.

Short pause. Roger stares at the high back of her chair.

ROGER
That is what I don't understand.
Why would you do this to us now?
When everything's finally going
our way again?

DORRIE
Going our way? Is that what you
call letting them take you apart
and put you back together again?

ROGER
Why do you think I'm doing this?

Dorrie LAUGHS. Peculiarly. As if faced with insanity:

DORRIE
Are you going to tell me now that
you're somehow doing this for me?
I_know why you're doing it, Roger.
And I hope that you find whatever
it is you're looking for up there.
And I hope it will make you happy.

Long pause. Roger looks so human, even with a torn face.

ROGER
I wonder, When I return from Mars
-+-will you still be here, in this
house, waiting for me?

(CONTINUED)
68

Dorrie holds her tea cup. It looks like she's thinking.

EXT--CALM RESIDENTIAL STREET--NIGHT

FATHER KAYMAN turns. His car SCREECHES around a corner.

EXT--ROGER AND DORRIE'S HOME--NIGHT

FATHER KAYMAN drives wildly up onto the front lawn. He
gets out and runs toward the front door. Stops to think.
Then he immediately hurries around the side of the house.

INT--ROGER AND DORRIE'S HOME--NIGHT

Looking through the shattered glass door: FATHER KAYMAN
steps into the backyard. Trying to see into the house.
He moves closer. Steps through the door looking stunned.
It is DARK inside but clearly the HOUSE HAS BEEN TRASHED.

BROKEN FURNITURE litters the floor. The PICTURES HANGING
CROOKED. JAGGED HOLES IN THE WALLS. It looks like a
wrecking crew was here. ONE CHAIR is still oddly upright
in the center of the room. Kayman tries to see further:

KAYMAN
Dorrie? Roger?

The Priest nearly trips. Trying to see in the dark. He
walks past that upright chair without realizing DORRIE is
sitting in it. Just as she was before. Holding that TEA
CUP AND SAUCER. Father Kayman turns and finally sees her
sitting there. She brings the cup to her lips. Takes a
SIP. Dried tears have left RIVERS OF MASCARA running
down her face. Dorrie returns the cup to the saucer and:

DORRIE
Roger asked me a question. And I
couldn't bear lying to him again.

EXT--PLOWED FIELD OF CORN--NIGHT

ROGER ambles through a plowed field. It is PITCH BLACK.
Hard to traverse the swelling rows. Roger stumbles along
aimlessly. s face slack. Like he doesn't care. Then
HEADLIGHTS suddenly appear on the horizon. Roger stares
at them a moment. A SPOTLIGHT begins sweeping the field
and Roger is pulled from his trance. He hits the ground.

    

Roger ducks low as the light sweeps over him. And then
it is DARK AGAIN. Headlights RECEDING INTO THE DISTANCE.

(CONTINUED)
69
CONTINUED :

Roger watches the horizon a moment. Then he rolls over.
Lying on his back in the middle of a plowed field. Like
a little boy might. Staring blankly at the night sky.
After a while, he looks thoughtful. As if he's focusing
on something in the sky. Roger lifts his head a little:

ROGER'S P.0.V. A panoramic NIGHT SKY FILLED WITH STARS.

Roger's INNER METALLIC EYELIDS slide shut to a WHIRRING.
When they open, he stares up with his TELESCOPIC LENSES:

ROGER'S P.O.V. Roger looks at that twinkling night sky.
Further. Further. Through the stars we could see with
the naked eye and BEYOND to DENSE CONSTELLATIONS and to
CLOUDS OF BRILLIANT STELLAR MATTER. To WONDROUS ASTRAL
BODIES not usually seen without a high-powered telescope.

Roger stares up with cold inhuman lenses where his human
eyeballs should be. The LENSES CHANGE THEIR FOCAL POINT
with a series of MUTED WHIRS. Roger searches the stars.
Below his cold eyes, his mouth opens in a look of wonder:

ROGER'S P.O.V. Roger scans the universe. Scrolling past
brilliant arrays of stars; and now, coming to rest, ON A
TINY RED BALL. The PLANET MARS. The way it would look
through large orbiting telescopes. A PERFECT RED GLOBE.

Roger lies in the dirt. A look of euphoria on his face.

EXT--DESOLATE COUNTRY ROAD--NIGHT

FATHER KAYMAN drives. Looking left, right. Peering into
the blackness. There is movement in the sky and suddenly
the headlights illuminate ROGER dropping down into the
middle of the road. Kayman SLAMS ON THE BRAKES. But far
too late. He is thrown forward at the SOUND OF A CRASH.

THE FRONT OF THE CAR IS DENTED IN. Roger casually walks
around to the passenger side, and gets in. Kayman looks
at him. Roger stares straight ahead out the windshield.
He doesn't speak a word. Kayman frowns, and drives off.

INT--STERILE HOSPITAL ROOM--NIGHT

SULIE CARPENTER paces. Wearing her nurse's uniform. She
stops when the door opens: FATHER KAYMAN steps in and
moves aside for ROGER. Roger doesn't make it too far
into the room before Sulie rushes up in her Texas school-
girl mode. Giving Roger an enormous hug. He returns it.

SULIE
Oh thank heaven you're all right!

(CONTINUED)
70

Sulie looks over Roger's shoulder and exchanges a terse
look with Kayman. But her voice is all warmth and joy:

SULIE (cont'd)
I was go worried about you!

INT--ADMINISTRATIVE STATISTICS --NIGHT

The enormous screens making up the walls are displaying
ROGER being looked over by DOCTORS. One is repairing his
face. SULIE comes to attention before the PANEL OF GRIM
MEN AND WOMEN. She notices that someone else is here in
this room, off to the side, and she can't help but look.
It is mission COMMANDER GODDARD staring back at her most
intently. Sulie seems momentarily surprised that he is
there...but she immediately stiffens again as she hears:

CENTER MAN
Your report, Major?

SULIE
Colonel Torraway's fluid expulsion
is a somewhat dramatic side-effect
of what I'm told is a minor glitch
in his system parameters. It will
be corrected within the next eight
hours. The "witness" to the event
is currently receiving a series of
injections which will sufficiently
cloud recollections of the evening.

Long pause. The Panel stares back at her. Very creepy.

CENTER MAN
And your psychological evaluation
of Colonel Torraway regarding his
relationship with his wife?

SULIE

I can bolster Roger up as long ag
he's here. However, when he's on
Mars, there's a good chance he'll
miss her more than he can handle,
eventually suffering an emotional
collapse as he constructs various
scenarios in his mind involving
her probable marital infidelities.

Long pause. The Panel stares back at her. Very creepy.

CENTER MAN
Then, may we take it that you are
suggesting extreme measures?

(CONTINUED)
71
CONTINUED:

Sulie frowns. Thinking. As if trying to understand him.

SULIE
Six? I don't understa--

CENTER MAN
(interrupting)
Thank you, Major. You may go now.

Sulie hesitates. Then she turns on her heels and leaves.

INT--THE STERILE CORRIDOR--NIGHT

The door marked "ADMINISTRATIVE STATISTICS" opens. SULIE
steps out into the hall. Leaning back against the door.
As if she's glad to be out of there. But disturbed, too.
She frowns. Then shrugs a bit, and starts down the hall.

EXT--ROGER AND DORRIE'S HOME--DAY

DORRIE steps out of the front door, and walks to her CAR.
Gets inside. She fumbles with a large PURSE, rummaging
through to remove MAKE-UP. As if talking to her purse:

‘DORRIE
Ceramics shop.

The ENGINE ROARS as her car begins to back out the drive.

EXT--DRIVING DOWN THE STRIP--DAY

DORRIE slides over to the passenger seat. She pulls down
her visor to peer into the MIRROR. Looks herself over.
Dorrie brings her COMPACT to her face, and then LIPSTICK.

 

The BRAKE PEDAL DEPRESSES. The car stops at a RED LIGHT.
Dorrie doesn't even look away from the mirror. After a
beat, the STEERING WHEEL TURNS, the GAS PEDAL DEPRESSES,
and the car makes a successful turn onto a busier street.

Dorrie seems fairly satisfied by her face. Then makes a
decision. Reaching down and coming up with her EYELINER.

A SEMI-TRAILER approaches, driving down the strip in the
opposing lane. Dorrie applies her make-up. She does not
notice her STEERING WHEEL SLOWLY TURNING. Inching into
the oncoming traffic. Turning more. A little bit more.
The truck BLOWS ITS HORN. Dorrie frowns and peeks around
the visor. That's when the GAS PEDAL DROPS TO THE FLOOR.

Dorrie SPEEDS INTO A HEAD-ON COLLISION WITH THE TRUCK and

EXT~-CEMETERY BURIAL PLOT--DAY

A PRIEST READS FROM THE BIBLE over the CASKET. Gathered
around the burial plot is an assemblage of ASTRONAUTS AND
THEIR SPOUSES, the MAN PLUS PERSONNEL, and grim SECRET
SERVICE AGENTS standing behind PRESIDENT DESHATINE. It
looks like rain. ROGER stares down at the casket of his
wife. He looks terrible. SULIE stands right beside him.

FATHER KAYMAN looks up. Stares across the casket at the
President of the United States. Deshatine looks grieved,
in a controlled presidential way. He lifts his head and
meets the Priest's gaze. Just for a moment. And with no
visible reaction. Kayman looks back down at the casket.

BRADLEY is standing back from the plot with ONE SECRET
SERVICE MAN ON EITHER SIDE OF HIM. He looks like hell.
After a moment, the Secret Service Men take him by the
elbows and lead him toward a ROW OF CARS. Bradley stares
back over his shoulder, but follows. REPORTERS AND T.V.
CREWS line the perimeter. MORE AGENTS keeping them back.

The Priest reads from the Bible. And it BEGINS TO RAIN.

Roger stands there. Like a statue. UMBRELLAS start to
come out. Sulie opens her umbrella, moving a step closer
to Roger, and raising it to shield them both. But then:

ROGER
No. Please don't.

Sulie hesitates. Takes the umbrella away. Looking up at
Roger with concern. Roger tilts his head back. dust a
little. Letting the RAIN STRIKE HIS FACE. The droplets
burst and run down his cheeks. Like tears. Roger looks
back down at the casket. His grief almost overwhelming.

ROGER
My eyes can do just about every-
thing. But they can't cry.

This is almost too much for Sulie. She looks like she's
about to lose it. Watching him with true feeling. She
lets the umbrella fall, standing with Roger in the rain.

DISSOLVE TO:

President Deshatine is led toward his car underneath a
roof of umbrellas held up by his Secret Service Agents.
Father Kayman approaches the group. He is immediately
motioned back by an Agent until Deshatine sees him there.

(CONTINUED)
73

DESHATINE
Father. You're getting drenched.

The Agents allow Kayman under the umbrellas. They walk.

KAYMAN
Did you think telling me you were
planning on killing her was going
to absolve you of your sin? You
were greatly mistaken, sir.

DESHATINE
Dorrie Torraway died in an auto
accident. Let's not lose sight
of that fact, shall we?

The President seems to get angry then. He stops walking.

DESHATINE

I'm not the least bit interested
in your absolution. And I don't
have the time to grieve over the
death of one silly woman. I've
got the entire civilized world to
look after--and a man to land on
the planet Mars.

Kayman listens. Face grim. Standing partly in the rain.

DESHATINE (cont'd)
Did you try talking Roger out of
volunteering for this duty? You
are his friend--how hard did you
try and stop him? Did you tell
Dorrie, "Excuse me, but the Pres-
ident is going to get rid of you,
if you don't play nice?" Do you
really think I'd want absolution
from you? You are in this up to
your stiff white collar, Father.

Pause. Deshatine seems all talked out. Until he adds:

DESHATINE

Donald, I do sympathize. You've
worked your entire adult life to
be a part of this Mars mission.

Tell me, what's really bothering
you: Your role in the death of

that poor woman we buried today?
Or the fact that, if you had the
chance to do it all over again...
you know you'd still end up here
in the cemetery, talking with me.

(CONTINUED)
74
CONTINUED :

President Deshatine walks off, and the mass of umbrellas
follow him toward a ROW OF DARK SEDANS out on the street.

Kayman doesn't move. Just standing there. In the rain.

EXT--STERILE HOSPITAL ROOM--NIGHT

There is a KNOCK on the door. But no response. After a
moment the door opens, and SULIE peeks in. Surprised to
find the lights off. She strains to see in the dark.
ROGER is at the window BALANCED IMPOSSIBLY ON THE TOP
EDGE OF A CHAIR. Gazing out the window. Sulie steps in:

SULIE
Roger? You all right?

Sulie steps closer. Roger does not respond. His back to
Sulie. When she gets close enough, Sulie can see that
Roger is staring out the window at the NIGHT SKY with his
TELESCOPIC LENSES. He slowly turns. Looking down at her
from his unlikely perch, the STARS REFLECTED IN HIS EYES.

ROGER
There's nothing left for me here.

INT--LARGE CONFERENCE ROOM--DAY

MAN PLUS PERSONNEL line the long table. FATHER KAYMAN.
BRADLEY. Mission COMMANDER GODDARD. NASA AND TECHNICAL
STAFF recognizable from earlier scenes. SULIE stands up.

SULIE
Roger is ready. He will never be
readier. The longer he remains
on Earth, the greater the risk he
will lose his current balance and
begin a lengthy grieving process.

At the head of the table, the CO-ORDINATOR seems pleased:

CO-ORDINATOR
Well that's fine news--our prime
launch date is seven weeks away.

SULIE
I apologize for not making myself
clear. Seven weeks is too long.
Seven days is too long. If I had
six more months with him I'd take
it. But seven weeks? There is
greater risk than benefit. Roger
is prepared to go to Mars. Today.

(CONTINUED)
75
CONTINUED :

Pause. Everybody stares at Sulie like they don't get it.

CO-ORDINATOR
What is it you propose, Major?

SULIE

Dr. Bradley's intentions are to
route the Colonel's perceptions
through a computer to guarantee
he doesn't suffer the same type
of brain hemorrhage that killed
Major Hartnett. It should be a
simple matter then to eliminate
Roger's sense of time, allowing
the seven weeks until launch to
pass, from Roger's perspective,
in the span of an instant.

BRADLEY
Whoa. Wait a minute. I need the
next seven weeks to fine-tune the
balance between the computer, and
Roger's organic brain. I can't--

CO-ORDINATOR
(interrupting)
Brad. Couldn't those adjustments
be made while en route to Mars?

Bradley stops, and looks around. As if a bit confused.

BRADLEY
Excuse me, sir. To be honest, I
assumed that you were just about
to inform me that I am no longer
a member of the crew.

Everyone stares at the head of the table. Most looking a
little embarrassed. Like they know what this is about.
The Co-ordinator motions for Sulie to sit, and she does.

CO-ORDINATOR
The feeling among the higher-ups
is that since Dr. Bradley is the
central driving force behind the
Man Plus perceptual system specs,
it is most imperative that he be
retained as a member of the crew.

SULIE
No offense intended, sir. But it
is clear that Roger has been made
aware of Bradley's...relationship
with his wife. I wouldn't advi--

(CONTINUED)
76

CO-ORDINATOR
(interrupting)

Major, Roger is going to spend the
entire voyage to and from Mars sus-
pended inside a cocoon. And while
the rest of the crew is limited to
a five-mile circle around the Mars
camp, the Man Plus will be free to
roam the surface with an unlimited
radius; and without need for water,
food, or supplies. That is why we

. If Roger is operating
to capacity, the rest of the crew
should have only sporadic physical
contact with him, at best. Brad?

BRADLEY
As Major Carpenter has reminded us,
Roger's perceptions will be routed
through his computer. So, when he
sees me, any animosity he may feel
will be removed before the signals
ean register on his brain.

KAYMAN
I don't understand. Why is that?

BRADLEY
Because feeling animosity toward
another member of the crew would
run counter to mission objectives.

SULIE

Look. I'm worried about Roger's
mental state if certain types of
natural emotions are prevented
from even crossing his mind.

(seeing an opportunity)
You're going to require a trained
psychiatrist on board. Best case
scenario, someone with whom Roger
has already forged a bond.

The Co-ordinator nods a little. He holds up a DOCUMENT.

CO-ORDINATOR

Apparently someone agrees. This
is it--the final crew roster for
the Mars flight: Roger Torraway;
mission commander, Steve Goddard;
Mars areologist, Father Donald

Kayman; cyborg system specialist,
Dr. Alexander Bradley; and Major
Sulie Carpenter. Any questions?

(CONTINUED)
77
CONTINUED :

The Co-ordinator waits only briefly. Gets up. The NASA
Technical Staff rises, hurriedly collecting their papers.

CO-ORDINATOR
Thank you, and congratulations to
one and all. It looks like we're
really going to Mars.

Everyone shuffles out of the room. Everyone except the
members of the Mars crew, sitting there to the sound of
FOOTSTEPS. And finally, a KLUNK as the door swings shut.

CAMERA MOVES, pans the crew for the first manned mission
to Mars: Father Kayman sits staring straight ahead into
space. He looks like he did in the cemetery. His bright
collar underlining a tortured face. Next in line, Sulie
stares up at the ceiling, with a glassy smile. Like she
can't believe she's really going. But, after a moment,
some other thought must pass through her mind, because
her smile fades. Bradley is next. Staring down at the
documents open on the table in front of him. He pushes
the papers away, looking down and off to the side. The
camera moves, to the end of the table. Commander Goddard
is staring across at the others. As if evaluating them.

Moments pass. The Mars crew sits there. Without a word.

GODDARD
Well. Just one big, happy crew.

INT--MAN PLUS SURGICAL CUBE--DAY

ROGER sits at the center of an electronic storm: PANELS
BLINKING and COMPUTERS WHIRRING and WIRES STRETCHING FROM
HIS BACK to a PORTABLE COMPUTER suspended above the floor
by thick supports. A HALF-DOZEN TECHNICIANS hit switches
and check the STATS CASCADING UP THE SCREENS. Roger sits
on a CHAIR COVERED WITH ELECTRONICS like a cyborg throne.

SULIE watches the Technicians work. She smiles at Roger:

SULIE
The next time we speak, Roger,
we'll be in orbit around Mars!

At the center of the electronics, Roger puts on a brave
face. An astronaut face. He gives Sulie a "thumbs-up."
Sulie's smile becomes less calculated, more genuine...but
then her smile fades all together. As if disappointed.

Roger's THUMB IS IN THE AIR. MOUTH STRETCHED IN A SMILE.
After a few moments, it becomes clear that he's not going
to move from that position. He is FROZEN, like a statue.

(CONTINUED)
78
CONTINUED :

SULIE
Jesus. You're not gonna leave him
like that, are you?

One of the Technicians turns. Looks at Sulie. He frowns
and moves over to a different console. TURNING A LEVER:

CLOSE-UP of ROGER'S THUMB. High in the air, giving a big
thumbs-up. Roger's hand turns sideways with a tiny WHIR.
Slowly. Like a machine. Then his thumb slowly takes its
place beside the other fingers. After a moment, his fist
uncurls and finally, with a WHIR, his arm slowly lowers.

The Technician seems satisfied. Turns ANOTHER KNOB now:

CLOSE-UP of ROGER'S SMILE as his mouth slowly turns down.
In stages. Like a machine. Very soon the smile is gone.

EXT--LAUNCH PAD AT THE CAPE--DAY

The MARS ROCKET rolls toward the LAUNCH PAD on a platform
with enormous TANK TREADS. The rocket inches forward,
literally at a snail's pace, accompanied by a RUUUUUMBLE.

EXT--ON THE CHERO STRIP--MONTAGE

The restaurants, hotels, and businesses lining the Chero
Strip display home-made SIGNS reading: "GOOD LUCK, MARS
ASTRONAUTS!" and "MARS, OR BUST!" and "MARTIANS BEWARE!"
TOUR BUSES up and down the strip. TOURISTS spilling out.

INT--INSIDE MISSION CONTROL--DAY

The LONG ROWS OF TERMINALS that make-up mission control
are swarming with CONTROLLERS in white shirts and ties
furiously working to bring their consoles to readiness.

INT--MARS COCKPIT SIMULATOR--DAY

COMMANDER GODDARD, FATHER KAYMAN, and SULIE sit three
across inside a command module simulator. Their faces as
focused as if this were real. Sulie keeps checking a
control panel, and reading off the numbers. Goddard has
his eyes focused on Kayman working the thruster controls.
They all look disappointed as a PIERCING KLAXON SOUNDS.

INT--MAN PLUS SURGICAL CUBE--DAY

ROGER sits absolutely still on his thick chair surrounded

by blinking and buzzing electronics. At a TERMINAL off
to the side, BRADLEY types away TAP TAP TAP TAP TAP TAP.
He stops working. Looking beat. Rubbing his tired face.

Bradley stands. Stretching for a moment. Then he slowly
walks from the room, leaving the motionless Roger alone.

INT--NEWS ANCHOR DESK--NEWSCAST

A NIGHTLY NEWS ANCHOR sits in front of a map of the world
as the FLAG OF THE NEW PEOPLE'S ASIA appears with FOOTAGE
of a SPACECRAFT DESCENDING FROM THE SKY UNDER PARACHUTES.

ANCHOR
What was intended to be the final
orbital test flight of their Mars
MAU-V rocket appears to have ended
in a set-back for the New People's
Asia. Details are slow in coming,
but it has been confirmed the crew
was forced to abort the flight be-
1 fore successfully achieving orbit.

The NASA AND MARS MISSION LOGO appear beside a CALENDAR.

ANCHOR
So it would seem that America will
again win the space race...if NASA
can pull off a successful launch
before the closing of the Earth-
Mars alignment window in September.

EXT--LAUNCH PAD AT THE CAPE--DAY

The MARS ROCKET rolls toward the LAUNCH PAD on a platform
with enormous TANK TREADS. Closer. But not a hell of a
lot closer. Inching forward with a deep RUUUUUUUUUUMBLE.

EXT--ON THE CHERO STRIP--MONTAGE

TOURISTS herd up and down the Chero Strip. They pose for
Photographs next to CARDBOARD CUT-OUTS OF THE MARS CREW.
The CHILDREN run around with LITTLE GREEN MARTIAN MASKS.
A FAMILY sitting in a BOOTH holding MENUS looks up as the
WAITRESS appears wearing a SILLY-LOOKING "SPACE" UNIFORM.

INT--INSIDE MISSION CONTROL--DAY

The rows of terminals that make-up mission control are
on-line as CONTROLLERS watch SCREENS SCROLLING WITH DATA.

INT--MARS COCKPIT SIMULATOR--DAY

COMMANDER GODDARD, FATHER KAYMAN, and SULIE sit three
across in the command module simulator. As focused as if
this were real. They must do something right, because
the LIGHTS BRIGHTEN, and then they all sit back and grin.

INT--MAN PLUS SURGICAL CUBE--DAY

ROGER sits motionless on his electronic chair. The room
empty except for Roger, the GLOW FROM THE BLINKING PANELS
all around making him look artificial. The DOOR SLIDES
OPEN, and SULIE steps in. Standing back in the shadows.
When she emerges it is clear that HER HAIR IS NOW BLONDE.

Sulie watches Roger a moment. Pulls up a chair. Sits.

SULIE
I don't know if you can hear me,
Roger. The technicians tell me
what you're experiencing is the
cyborg equivalent of sleep. If
they knew I was here they would
probably laugh at me.

Sulie smiles a little. Of course, Roger does not move.

SULIE
Well. If you could see me, you
would be wondering about my hair.
This is my real color; and these
are my eyes, without the tinted
contacts. Don't think I'm naive.
If I was fifteen pounds heavier,
or a couple inches shorter, well,
let's say it was my resemblance
to your wife that landed me this
job. I guess if I wasn't a size
seven I wouldn't be on my way to
Mars right now, huh?

Sulie stands up. Almost tentative. She reaches into the
pocket of her jumpsuit and takes out a FRAMED PHOTOGRAPH.

SULIE
I had that photograph developed.

Sulie looks down at it. Grins. Steps over to Roger, and
Places the frame down on a tiny surface beside his chair:

CLOSE-UP of the PHOTO. Sulie is leaning over Roger's
hospital bed KISSING HIM ON THE CHEEK. Roger looks more
than a little stunned. Wearing a GOOFY LOOK ON HIS FACE.

SULIE
It wasn't all a lie. Everything I
told you that day. You really are
the bravest man I know. And I did
have your picture on my wall.

CAMERA'S P.O.V. Sulie leans over and gently kisses Roger
on the cheek. The PHOTOGRAPH is in view, too. And the
images are almost the same: Sulie leaning over. Kissing
Roger on that same cheek. The difference is that the
Roger in the photograph wears a stunned, embarrassed, and
very human face. But the Roger that Sulie is kissing now
stares straight ahead. Without the tiniest sign of life.

INT--STERILE COMPLEX CORRIDOR--DAY
ROGER is being rolled down a corridor. He must be naked

under the SHEET beca' the RED TILES below his neck are
visible. Roger stares at the ceiling. Does not blink.

 

ROGER'S P.O.V. The ceiling of the corridor rolls past.
Turning now. PASSING THROUGH A SWINGING DOOR and rolling
under BRIGHT SURGICAL LIGHTS. After a moment, the MASKED
SURGEONS who built Roger lean over. Staring down at him.
One Surgeon holds out his hand...and receives a SCALPEL.

SURGEON 1
All right. Let's make a Martian.

INT--WHITE HOUSE OVAL OFFICE~--DAY

A REPORTER WITH THE EMPTY LAUNCH PAD in the background
KLIKS OFF as the TV GOES BLANK. PRESIDENT DESHATINE lays
down his REMOTE. Looks pleased. The PRESIDENTIAL AIDE
begins placing DOCUMENTS in front of Deshatine, reciting:

AIDE

The garbage strike in New York is
in its third week. The famine in
eastern Europe is getting worse.
The N.P.A. nuclear submarine, The
East is Red, is two miles outside
the coast of Melbourne, Australia,
and refuses to answer their hails.
Forty-one countries--so far--have
declared that if our Mars launch
damages the ozone layer they will
consider it a "hostile act."

The Aide reaches for a DESKTOP COMPUTER and strikes one
key. Immediately that CHART seen earlier appears, with
the BROAD BLACK LINE GROWING UPWARD TOWARD THAT RED BAR.

AIDE
And, the new trendline forecasts
predict a third world war by the
end of this decade.

Deshatine watches the Aide step around the table. Sit.

DESHATINE
You think I've been playing with
my spacemen too much?

The Aide does not respond. The President watches hin.
He gets up. Wanders over to the window, and stares out.

DESHATINE
For the sake of discussion, let's
assume that we are rushing toward
World War III. Let us also agree
that human history has been--and
will continue to be--the record of
mankind's never-ending struggle to
annihilate his fellow man, and lay
waste to-this beautiful world. In
thirty years, we could have a Mars
colony, with hundreds of occupants.
And if we succeed in blowing each
other to smithereens down here, I
want that Mars colony up there,
don't you? Maybe, on Mars, we'll
finally get it right.
84

EXT--MARS CRAFT IN SPACE--DAY

The FINAL BOOSTER FIRES a blinding BURST OF WHITE FLAME.
The burn quickly stops. But the booster does not eject:

The BOOSTER MODULE and COMMAND MODULE begin to DETACH,
splitting into two distinct pieces, a METAL TETHER LINE
stretching between the modules. The two halves continue
to separate. Floating away from one another. Further.
And further. Soon each one is just a GLINT OF REFLECTED
METAL one mile away from the other, the tether stretching
between them, as if it simply DISAPPEARS IN THE DISTANCE.

THRUSTERS FIRE. The SHIP BEGINS TO ROTATE in a mile-wide
arc. The STARS BECOMING A BLUR. From the command module
or the booster the whole UNIVERSE APPEARS TO BE SPINNING.

INT--COMMAND MODULE TOUR--DAY

SULIE stands in the COCKPIT. The seats and control panel
appear to "face down"--where the floor should be--and
Sulie has to step carefully along the ledge so as to not
tumble into the nose of the craft. She reaches a SET OF
RUNGS, and climbs, Emerging onto LEVEL ONE [the living
quarters} and continuing on past FATHER KAYMAN at a table
eating COLORED PASTE. GODDARD riding an EXERCISE BIKE.

Sulie emerges onto LEVEL TWO [the science level] which
holds a COSMIC RAY SHELTER that resembles a bank vault,
and the Man Plus ELECTRONIC COCOON. BRADLEY types at a
TERMINAL set in the side of the cocoon. Sulie climbs on
past, and reaches an AIRLOCK DOOR. She touches a pad and
the door opens with a WHOOOSH. Sulie enters the AIRLOCK:

The airlock is lined with SPACESUITS. The TETHER LINE
actually extends into the ship here, like a thick pillar
in the center of the room. At the base of this "pillar"
rests a futuristic-looking TETHER-RIDER. Like a sort of
two-seated space motorcycle. But in place of wheels, the
vider features a cylindrical base that hugs the tether.
Sulie steps onto the floor. Looks around. And then up:

SULIE'S P.O.V. The ceiling of the airlock is actually
the OUTER AIRLOCK DOOR, the TETHER LINE visible through
the porthole STRETCHING INTO THE DISTANCE...and finally
disappearing into a dizzying universe of SPIRALING STARS.

GODDARD steps up beside a CURTAIN IN THE WALL. He looks
around once before KNOCKING on the frame. The CURTAIN
SLIDES OPEN, and SULIE peeks out, wearing an undershirt,
lying inside a SLEEPING CHAMBER set in the wall. Sulie
blinks, as if woken from a deep sleep. Goddard inquires:

: GODDARD
Would you like...uh...company?

Sulie looks confused for a moment. But then understands.
She smiles, shakes her head, and slides the curtain shut.

BRADLEY steps up beside that same square curtain set in
the wall. Looks around, He KNOCKS. Waits. The curtain
opens--and SULIE stares out. Looking tired and pissed.
Her expression immediately giving Bradley his answer. He
turns on his heels, and leaves. Sulie watches him go.
Then she grabs the curtain, and roughly slides it shut.

GODDARD is crouched down in front of the camera, FATHER
KAYMAN and SULIE beside him. BRADLEY is in the rear, but
off to one side, as if keeping space open for someone who
is not there yet. They are TAKING OFF THEIR WRISTWATCHES
and replacing them with NEW WRISTWATCHES. And doing this
rather ceremoniously. Each raising their arms to display
these new watches for the camera. Holding this position.

INT--NASA BROADCAST STUDIO--DAY

The room is LINED WITH SCREENS DISPLAYING THE IMAGE FROM
OUTER SPACE. The TECHNICIANS working at their consoles:

CAMERA MOVES, down a row of screens. One screen seems to
ISOLATE THAT EMPTY SPACE NEXT TO BRADLEY. The next one

The next screen begins to FILL IN THE SHAPE with color.

INT--NEWS ANCHOR DESK-~-NEWSCAST

A NIGHTLY NEWS ANCHOR pauses as a window opens over his
shoulder showing THE MARS CREW EXCHANGING WRISTWATCHES.
Goddard crouched down in front. Father Kayman and Sulie
beside him. Bradley is in the rear--NEXT TO AN IMAGE OF
ROGER TORRAWAY looking as human as the rest of the crew.

ANCHOR
Aboard the command module Mariner
this morning, the Mars crew cele-
brated reaching the halfway point
in their journey--by switching to
watches that are designed for the
Martian day. A day on Mars is 37
minutes longer than here on Earth.

The image is replaced by FUZZY JERKY FOOTAGE that shows
something DESCENDING WILDLY DOWN TO THE SURFACE OF MARS.

ANCHOR
Although their arrival on Mars is
still months away, the first wave
of robotic landers--sent ahead of
the crew--has already begun their
descent to the surface of the red
planet. Among the equipment is a
land rover and a fuel synthesizer
to generate oxygen and methane as
xvequired to power their base camp.

A SIMULATION takes the place of the live footage, showing
a ROBOTIC LANDER OPENING UP releasing a CABLE THAT BEGINS
TO EXTEND TOWARD THE SKY, like some mechanical beanstalk.

(CONTINUED)
ANCHOR
One device is designed to deploy
a single cable from the surface
through the atmosphere--and into
orbit above the planet.

ANOTHER SIMULATION shows the GENTLE CURVE OF MARS broken
suddenly by the CABLE as it RISES ALL THE WAY INTO SPACE.

ANCHOR (cont'd)
The so-called "elevator to space"
is only possible due to the weak
Martian gravity; and is intended
for the transfer of supplies and
equipment between the orbiting
command module and the Mars camp.

  

INT--COMMAND MODULE- -MONTAGE

The MARS CREW gathers together. They have never seemed
quite so familiar. Kayman carefully positions a CAMERA.

MARS CREW'S P.O.V. A SMALL ROUND PORTHOLE reveals STARS.
Spinning. The UNIVERSE IS SPINNING. And then, there is
something else: a TINY RED BALL moves into view. About
the SIZE OF A SMALL BUTTON. The bright red planet MARS.

DISSOLVE TO:
The planet Mars moves into view. The SIZE OF A GOLFBALL.

DISSOLVE TO:
The planet Mars moves into view. The SIZE OF A BASEBALL.

DISSOLVE TO:
The planet Mars moves into view. The SIZE OF A SOFTBALL.

DISSOLVE TO:
The planet Mars moves into view. For the very first time
it is BIGGER THAN THE PORTHOLE. For a moment it BLOCKS
OUT THE STARS. As if the entire universe outside is RED.
The MARS CREW is huddled together by the porthole, amazed
by the view. Staring in silence. Father Kayman with his
eye at his camera CLICKING frame after frame after frame.

INT--THE MAN PLUS COCOON--DAY

ROGER is suspended inside his cocoon. That RED HAND more

like a CLAW. His RED GLOWING EYE staring straight ahead.
The TIP OF A WING. Suddenly, his FINGER TWITCHES. The
EYE MOVES. For the first time his entire body can be
seen but it is HIDDEN IN SHADOW. Just the suggestion of
a shape that is human, but not human. PULLING AGAINST
THE STRAPS KEEPING HIM IN PLACE. Then again. Violently.

INT--THE LIVING QUARTERS--DAY

The MARS CREW is huddled in front of their tiny porthole.
Staring out. After a moment, there is a MUTED THUD. The
Mars Crew frowns. Looking confused. Then, another THUD.

INT--OUTSIDE THE COCOON- -DAY

The Man Plus ELECTRONIC COCOON IS ALIVE with activity:
The surface BLINKING. WHIRRING. SCREENS SCROLLING with
data. FATHER KAYMAN, SULIE, BRADLEY, and GODDARD stare.
All just standing there, like they don't know what to do.

Without warning the COCOON GOES DEAD. The lights flicker
off. The noise stops. The screens go gray. Suddenly,
they could hear a pin drop. What they hear is THE LATCH
SLOWLY TURNING. There is a tiny KLAK as the door opens.

The door slowly swings away until it hits the side of the
cocoon with a KUNK. But nothing happens. The interior
is dead. PITCH BLACK. Then a RED HAND grabs for a hold.
More like a CLAW. TWO RED GLOWING EYES appear, points of
angry light from somewhere in the dark. ROGER emerges.

He is unclothed. His body COVERED IN RED TILES, without
human skin. Roger's face is there, clearly recognizable,
but his FACE IS RED--and there is nothing to off-set the
effect of his GLOWING RED LENSES. Roger says nothing.
Not looking at the crew. Sulie is about to speak, when:

Roger's BAT WINGS UNFURL on either side of him. Red and
translucent. The wings unfolding. Further. And still
further. Taking the width of the capsule and, when they
run out of room, curving around the perimeter. The wings
move, expanding and contracting, like the wings of a bat.

Roger slowly turns his head toward the rest of the crew.
His face lacking any emotion. Roger looks like a DEMON.
EXT--DEEP IN OUTER SPACE--DAY

Nothing but STARS. A GLINT OF METAL APPEARS. It is the

COMMAND MODULE rotating at the end of its TETHER LINE.
The module sweeps past, disappearing back into the stars.

INT--THE LIVING QUARTERS--DAY

The Mars crew sits around the table: ROGER at one end,
perched impossibly on the top edge of a chair, his great
wings gathered around and above him, like some housebound
gargoyle. KAYMAN, SULIE, and BRADLEY line the table with
COMMANDER GODDARD at the far end. They can't take their
eyes off Roger, although they seem as if they'd like to.

SULIE
We're all happy you can finally
join us, Roger. Even though it
was a bit of a surprise.

Everyone waits for Roger to respond, but he says nothing.
Roger is absolutely still. Only his wings RUSTLE gently.

GODDARD
Bradley? Feel free to comment.

BRADLEY
Either he doesn't want to talk or
he can't. It's as simple as that.

GODDARD
Let's assume for the moment that
he can't. Why would that be?

SULIE
Can something be wrong with the
interface between his brain and
his computer?

BRADLEY
I wouldn't say that anything is
"wrong." That's overstating it.

KAYMAN
(a bit too loudly)
You don't think there's something
a little wrong here?!

Short pause. Everyone gives Kayman a look. They notice
that the Priest seems rather deeply unsettled by Roger.

BRADLEY
Look. I realize this isn't what
we expected, but just because he
isn't engaging in small talk--

SULIE
(interrupting)
Reger. Do you know why the com-
puter woke you up early?

(CONTINUED)
91
CONTINUED :

Pause. Roger does not respond. His wings RUSTLE gently.

SULIE
Commander, you ask him. He may
respond to an inquiry from you.

GODDARD
Rog. Do we have a problem?

The answer is immediate. Almost before Goddard finishes:

ROGER
(an inhuman voice)
YESSSSSSSS8SSSSS.

Pause. The quality of Roger's voice seems to stun them.

GODDARD.
What kind of problem?

Roger touches a spot on the tabletop. A KEYBOARD rises,
and he begins TAPPING furiously, not even looking at the
keys. The TABLE TURNS INTO A SCREEN and everyone watches
the table scroll with SHIP BLUEPRINTS AND DIAGRAMS. The
graphics work their way down the course of the tether
line to the BOOSTER MODULE, highlighting an INSIDE PANEL.

Everyone shifts in their seats to see a graphic of what
looks like a SIMPLE COMPUTER CIRCUIT. The screen BLINKS.

GODDARD
When we disengage the tether, this
circuit will blow.

KAYMAN
I don't understand. How can Roger
even know about this?

BRADLEY
With Roger in stasis, his computer
wouldn't have a lot to do. So, it
was designed to act as a watch-dog
to detect problems that the ship's
own navigating system would be too
busy to detect. Looks like it did.

SULIE
Yes, it did. Two hours from orbit.
Can we fix this in time?

GODDARD
That's a good question. How about
it, Rog? Do you think you can re-
route this entire panel?

(CONTINUED)
92
CONTINUED :

ROGER
YESSSSSSS8SSS888S.

GODDARD
And can you complete the procedure
before the orbital burn?

ROGER
YESSSSSS8SSS8Ssss.

GODDARD
All right then. Let's go to work.

They all start to go. But Father Kayman stops them with:

KAYMAN
Isn't anybody worried about Roger?

Pause. Everybody turns. Looks at Roger atop the chair.

GODDARD
He seems fine, for the time being.

Kayman is about to protest. But Goddard sees it coming:

GODDARD (cont'd)
If something goes wrong with that
burn, we could bounce off Mars on
our way out of the solar system--
or burn up in the atmosphere. Do
either of these sound appealing?
Our first priority is this ship.

SULIE
Look. Maybe I can have some time
with Roger. A few minutes, alone.

Goddard looks into Sulie's eyes, and decides not to put
up an argument. He nods his approval. Turning to Roger:

GODDARD
Rog. Major Carpenter is going to
speak with you. Maybe, ask you a
question or two. You understand?

Roger is balanced on the chair. His wings RUSTLE gently.

ROGER
YEsssssssssssss.

CcuT TO:

ROGER is still perched impossibly on the top edge of that
chair. His great wings gathered around and above him.

(CONTINUED)
93
CONTINUED :

Like a gargoyle. SULIE sits directly across from him in
the opposing chair. Posture casual. Her expression not:

SULIE
How are you feeling?

Long pause. Roger does not respond. But, for the first
time, his WINGS CLEARLY STOP THEIR RUSTLING. Absolutely
still. The silence is acute without that gentle rustle.

SULIE
Well. Maybe we can come back to
that one, later, huh?

Roger does not respond. But HIS WINGS RUSTLE once more.

INT--INSIDE THE AIRLOCK--DAY

BRADLEY wiggles inside the TOP HALF OF HIS SPACESUIT held
in place on the wall. Once inside, he lifts the suit off
the supports, with a grimace. FATHER KAYMAN immediately
goes to work SNAPPING LATCHES and connecting TUBES and
hitting SWITCHES to a FSSSSSSSSH. Kayman is working like
@ man possessed. Hitting a CLASP here. Pulling VELCRO
taut there. Faster. And faster. And rougher. Bradley
looks irritated. Kayman SLAMS A LATCH DOWN on the chest
plate and, just as Bradley is about to complain, Kayman
grabs the spacesuit and shoves Bradley against the wall:

KAYMAN
(bordering on a threat)
What the hell is wrong with Roger?

Bradley frowns. Latches the mechanism at the base of his
HELMET with a KLAK, staring at Kayman through the visor.

BRADLEY
I calibrated Roger's systems using
figures transmitted to me directly
from the super-computer in Houston,
double-checked by a second located
at Los Alamos, New Mexico. I know
you may not think much of me, on a
personal level. But I know my job.
(short pause)
Can you let me go, please, Father?

Kayman realizes he is still holding him pinned. Lets go.

KAYMAN
(controlled, but angry)
How can the figures they've been
sending you be so wrong?

(CONTINUED)
94
CONTINUED:

BRADLEY
I don't suppose they can be wrong.

KAYMAN
But his personality is completely
submerged, You saw Roger.

BRADLEY
Don. I don't want to lie to you.
We did what we believed we had to
do to keep Roger alive. Truth is,
no one knew if his human identity
would ever survive the procedure.

(short pause)

Now we know, don't we?

INT--THE LIVING QUARTERS --DAY

ROGER is perched impossibly on the top edge of his chair.
SULIE sits across from him. Roger's wings RUSTLE gently.

SULIE
Is this mission important to you?

ROGER
YEsSssssssssssss.

SULIE
Can you tell me why?

ROGER
NNNNNNNNNNNNNNO .

SULIE
Being the first man on Mars was a
dream of yours, wasn't it, Roger?
The happiest moments of your life
were those spent hanging in orbit
above the Earth, and on the moon.

Pause. Roger does not respond. His wings RUSTLE gently.
SULIE
Could those be some reasons why
the mission is important to you?

ROGER
YESSSssssssssss.

SULIE
How are you feeling?

Roger's WINGS STOP THEIR RUSTLING. And again the silence

seems acute. Sulie's demeanor begins to visibly crack.
Like this is breaking her up. A difficult pause before:

SULIE
I'm honored to be here with you,
Colonel, to witness the culmina-
tion of all your dreams.

Roger is perched on the chair like a gargoyle. His face
emotionless. Great wings gathered around and above him.

INT--INSIDE THE COCKPIT--DAY
GODDARD wears a HEADSET. He speaks into the mouthpiece:

GODDARD

«Colonel Torraway will traverse
the tether and re-route the panel.
Dr. Bradley is the logical choice
to accompany him in the case that
Roger experiences some difficulty.
Houston, this message will take 20
minutes to reach Earth. Figuring
ten minutes for you folks to come
up with a response, and 20-minutes
for your reply to arrive, I expect
we'll have this problem licked by
then. It's times like these when
we realize how far away we really
are. This is Mariner. Out.

INT--ON THE SCIENCE LEVEL--DAY

FATHER KAYMAN positions a HEADSET into place. Looks up.

KAYMAN
Bradley? Can you hear me?

BRADLEY'S VOICE
Yes. I can hear you.

SULIE steps up. Wearing her HEADSET. She looks up, too.

INT--INSIDE THE AIRLOCK--DAY

ROGER sits in the first position on the TETHER-RIDER with
the SPACESUITED BRADLEY in the second seat. Both mounted
on a motorcycle that POINTS UP LIKE A ROCKET. Beneath

them, set into the floor, rests the INNER AIRLOCK DOOR.
Through the porthole FATHER KAYMAN and SULIE are visible
staring up inside the airlock, with worried expressions.

There is a DEEP RUMBLE. A BRIGHT SLIVER OF LIGHT strikes
Roger and Bradley. Growing wider. Wider. Bradley looks
awed for a brief moment before his VISOR DARKENS and his
face is replaced by the REFLECTION OF THE STARS OUTSIDE.

ROGER AND BRADLEY'S P.O.V. The OUTER DOOR OPENS to the
void of space. The TETHER LINE stretches off toward the
stars, disappearing into the distance, as if endless.
Outside the ship the whole UNIVERSE SEEMS TO BE SPINNING.

EXT--DEEP IN OUTER SPACE--DAY

The TETHER-RIDER EMERGES from the airlock and starts out
across the enormous cable. ROGER AND BRADLEY are bathed
in the bright harsh light of space. Roger's WINGS EXPAND
TO THEIR FULL LENGTH. Shimmering in the light. The SHIP
ABRUPTLY RECEDES behind them as they sail down the cable.

INSIDE BRADLEY'S HELMET. Bradley makes a SUCKING SOUND.

INT--ON THE SCIENCE LEVEL--DAY
FATHER KAYMAN and SULIE share a look. GODDARD steps up.

KAYMAN
Everything okay, Brad?

EXT--DEEP IN OUTER SPACE--DAY

Looking down at the tether from above: ROGER AND BRADLEY
sail across the cable as, below them, the UNIVERSE SPINS.

BRADLEY
Yeah. This is just...one hell of
aride. That's all.

Bradley turns stiffly. The command module is just barely
visible. A GLINT OF REFLECTED LIGHT. Then gone. Right
now, they seem to be riding a cable stretching from one
side of the universe to the other. There is some STATIC:

KAYMAN'S VOICE
How's Roger doing?

BRADLEY'S P.0.V. Looking out through his FOGGING HELMET
VISOR: Panning across spiraling stars. Turning toward
Roger now. His wings seem to grow right out of his back.

(CONTINUED)
97
CONTINUED:

BRADLEY
Fine.

KAYMAN'S VOICE
You're nearing the mid-point. Can
you see that on your tracker?

Bradley twists his body. Tilting down, and to the side:

CLOSE-UP of a SCREEN on the tether-rider's console. The
DIAGRAM OF THE SHIP there has a DOT marking the mid-point
of the cable. A BLINKING DOT is quickly approaching it.
Bradley's GLOVED HAND wipes away a layer of SPACE DUST.

BRADLEY
Yes. It's working. I can see it.

Bradley leans over the console. The DISTORTED REFLECTION
IN THE CORNER OF HIS HELMET VISOR shows Roger sitting in
the front seat. Suddenly, the REFLECTION MOVES. Roger
RETRACTS HIS WINGS, and TURNS AROUND. Bradley's visor
reflects a DISTORTED IMAGE OF ROGER PERCHED MENACINGLY ON
THE CYCLE. Like a gargoyle. Bradley turns back around:

BRADLEY
Rog?

A DISTORTED IMAGE in his visor of a FIST RUSHING CLOSER.

BRADLEY
AAA--

Roger's FIST BURSTS BRADLEY'S HELMET and JAGGED SHARDS OF
SHINY VISOR SPIRAL AWAY beside PERFECT SPHERES OF BLOOD.

FATHER KAYMAN, SULIE, and GODDARD stiffen. Step closer.

KAYMAN
Brad, what is it? What's wrong?

Nothing but STATIC. The Priest touches his mouthpiece:

a moment there is nothing but ECHOED BREATHING from their
suits. Then a HUM as something rises. Goddard and Sulie
step back as a SECOND TETHER-RIDER emerges from storage.
They exchange a look across the top of the rider. Grim.

EXT--DEEP IN OUTER SPACE--DAY

The AIRLOCK OPENS revealing SULIE AND GODDARD atop the
TETHER-RIDER. Goddard in the first position and Sulie in
the second. Their faces are visible for a moment before
their VISORS DARKEN leaving only the REFLECTION OF THE
ENORMOUS TETHER disappearing into a SPIRALING UNIVERSE.

They ride out into the void on a cable across the stars.

INT--ON THE SCIENCE LEVEL--DAY
FATHER KAYMAN paces back-and-forth. Finally, can't wait:

KAYMAN
Major? You see anything?

EXT--DEEP IN OUTER SPACE~-DAY

SULIE AND GODDARD ride the tether. Goddard lifts a thick
glove and points. Suliie slowly leans to look around him:

SULIE AND GODDARD'S P.O.V. The tether stretches on into
the distance. But there is something above it. Whatever
it is FLASHES LIKE A LIGHTHOUSE. As if it is rotating.

SULIE
Yes. Something up ahead now.

The object in the distance takes shape, no longer a glint
ef light without clear boundaries. It has ARMS AND LEGS.
Becoming a SPACESUIT floating above the cable. Rotating.

SULIE
Oh, god. It's Brad.

Goddard manipulates the controls and they pull to a stop
underneath the spacesuit. As what's left of the suit
rotates around, they can see that the VISOR IS SHATTERED,
and there is NOTHING IN THE HELMET BUT BLOOD SPLATTERED
ON THE INTERIOR. As if Bradley's head exploded in there.

Sulie's BREATHING suddenly comes faster. Still faster.

SULIE
Shit. I'm gonna be sick in here.

99
CONTINUED:

Sulie and Goddard lean back, a DISTORTED REFLECTION OF
THE SPINNING SPACESUIT ON THEIR HELMET VISORS as Brad's
dead body rotates around again, the burst faceplate like
some sick, twisted caricature of a wild laughing mouth.

Sulie's BREATHING begins to slow. They stare up at what
remains of Bradley. In contrast to the cold artificial
look of their spacesuits, and the universe around them
reflected in their visors, their voices sound very human:

GODDARD
Major. You all right?

SULIE
I think so. Why is he spinning
around like that?

GODDARD
He isn't. We are.

SULIE
Oh...yeah. Right.

Sulie leans over. Looks at the console seen earlier: a
DIAGRAM OF THE SHIP shows they are at the exact center of
the tether. The BLINKING DOT marking the location is the
only point on the ship that appears to remain stationary.

SULIE
We're exactly half-way across
the tether. The ship rotates
around this central point.

INT--ON THE SCIENCE LEVEL--DAY
FATHER KAYMAN is listening. His eyes moving. Confused.

KAYMAN
So, what are you saying?

SULIE'S VOICE
I'm saying that Roger killed Brad
at the only point along the cable
where we could retrieve his body.

EXT--DEEP IN OUTER SPACE~-DAY
SULIE and GODDARD watch the dead body rotate above them.
SULIE (cont'd)

Could be a coincidence, or maybe
Roger wanted us to find him.

KAYMAN'S VOICE
What are we going to do?

There is no response. Sulie shifts her position a bit.

SULIE
Commander?

INSIDE GODDARD'S HELMET. Goddard stares out through his
helmet visor. Looking grim. SWEAT runs down his face.
It takes him a moment to realize he has been addressed.

GODDARD
Let's bring Bradley's body down.

Sulie reaches to the waist of her suit. PULLS OUT A HOOK
AND LINE from the belt. Attaches the hook to the rider.

Sulie stands up, and PUSHES OFF. FLOATING UP TOWARD THE
BODY spinning above her. Like a skin diver rising to the
surface of the water. Her BREATHING coming a bit faster.

Goddard watches. Sulie above him REFLECTED IN HIS VISOR.

CLOSE-UP of SULIE'S GLOVED HAND approaching a HOOK set in
the chest plate of Brad's suit. No sound but BREATHING.
Sulie floats closer. The thick tips of her fingers about
to make contact...when suddenly HER HAND IS PULLED AWAY.

SULIE IS SPUN AROUND. Goddard is manipulating the rider
controls. Hurling down the tether PULLING SULIE BEHIND
HIM. She begins to spin at the end of her safety line.
Helpless. Arms and legs outstretched. BREATHING rapid.

SULIE
Commander?

There is no response. Goddard's face hidden behind a

visor REFLECTING THE STARS. He reaches a gloved hand to

the console FLIPPING A SERIES OF TOGGLES to great STATIC.

INT--ON THE SCIENCE LEVEL--DAY

FATHER KAYMAN jerks as STATIC rips through his headset.
KAYMAN

SULIE spins helplessly at the end of the safety line, her
BREATHING coming in furious waves. Below her, GODDARD is

pressing the tether-rider forward, his face hidden behind
his visor. Pulling Sulie along like a water skier in the
sky. Goddard leans over stiffly. Looks at the console:

CLOSE-UP of that SCREEN. The DIAGRAM OF THE SHIP shows
their current location with a BLINKING DOT. Far now from
the center, the dot is clearly rotating in a wide circle.

Goddard stops the rider...but SULIE KEEPS GOING, floating
over him to the front of the cycle, until the safety wire
goes TAUT and she stops. Spinning wildly now. BREATHING
frantically. REFLECTED IN THE VISOR of Goddard's helmet.

INSIDE GODDARD'S HELMET. Goddard watches Sulie floating
above him. He is drenched with sweat. Looking like he'd
rather be someplace else but knowing that's not possible:

GODDARD
I'm truly sorry, Major.

Goddard's thick gloved hand takes hold of the SAFETY LINE
anchoring Sulie to the tether-rider. Then he UNHOOKS IT.

INSIDE SULIE'S HELMET. Sulie watches Goddard wide-eyed.

SULIE'S P.O.V. Sulie's BREATHING IS DEAFENING inside the
helmet. Through her FOGGED VISOR Goddard and the tether
line BEGIN TO MOVE AWAY. Rotating on its mile-wide arc.

Sulie releases a TORTURED SCREAM as the UNIVERSE SUDDENLY
STOPS SPINNING around her. The TETHER LINE RECEDING INTO
THE DISTANCE. Goddard and the tether-rider already too
small to make out. Sulie hangs alone in the empty void
of space. Spinning slowly. Finally her SCREAMING STOPS.

And then there is only the lonely sound of her BREATHING.

INT--ON THE SCIENCE LEVEL--DAY
FATHER KAYMAN stands helpless. Tapping his microphone:

KAYMAN
Major? Commander? Come in.

The Priest stands there looking worried. His expression
deepens as a familiar KLAXON sounds. Kayman turns to see
a COMPUTER PANEL COMING ALIVE. The SCREEN FLASHES RED
with the words: NINCOMING RADIATION." A TIMER appears
and immediately begins TICKING DOWN from THIRTY MINUTES.

KAYMAN
Oh, Lord. Is anybody receiving
me? Please respond. Hello?

CAMERA'S P.O.V. LOOKING IN FROM THE OUTSIDE: The open
airlock reveals the INNER AIRLOCK DOOR and, through the
PORTHOLE set in the door, Kayman is visible staring up
and out into space. Looking helpless. And quite alone.

EXT--DEEP IN OUTER SPACE--DAY

GODDARD sails across the tether toward a GLINT OF LIGHT
that becomes the BOOSTER MODULE. Soon it dwarfs him.
Goddard rides the tether inside and disappears from view.

INT--THE BOOSTER MODULE--DAY

An INNER AIRLOCK DOOR OPENS and GODDARD climbs down into
a module that's all PIPES AND TANKS. Goddard reaches the
bottom. Looks around. As if searching for someone. He
opens the mechanism at his neck and removes his helmet.
Not easy. He looks exhausted. Hair matted to his head.

Goddard steps down a ROW OF TANKS giving off STEAM that
hangs in the air like a thick wet fog. He sees a PANEL
WITH A TANGLE OF JURY-RIGGED WIRES protruding. He stops.

Goddard looks over the work. Behind him, the DENSE STEAM
SUDDENLY CLEARS...and ROGER is visible standing between
two large tanks. His RED EYES GLOWING. The steam around
him seems to catch the red. His face cold. No emotion.

GODDARD
Good work, Rog. We'll be able to
disengage the tether, and perform
the orbital burn, without blowing
the booster.

Pause. Roger seems to want to speak. But it looks like
it's a struggle. Finally, he manages to open his mouth:

ROGER
THIS SSSSSSHIP IZZ2Z2Z2Z2Z WRRRRRONG.

Goddard turns. Looks Roger over, as if surprised. Nods.

GODDARD

That's correct, Colonel. Your
work here is a band-aid. Four
days prior to launch, our boys

at the cape found a design flaw.
This ship will lose 60% of its
power twenty-seven hours after
achieving orbit around Mars. I'm
afraid this mission was doomed

to £ail...before it ever began.

(CONTINUED)
103

Roger takes one step from the steam. Goddard moves back.

GODDARD
It's a goddamn shame. But we did
have to go before the launch win-
dow closed--if we wanted to get a
two-year head start on the Asians.

Roger takes a second step forward. Goddard moves back.

GODDARD (cont'd)
Unfortunately, the ship won't have
enough power to support four human
crew members during the five month
trip back to Earth.

Roger moves forward, his wings conforming to the space
between the tanks. Goddard backs away. Looking nervous.

GODDARD
I assume some part of you realizes
you've been programmed to dispose
of the rest of the crew. In case
you're wondering, my orders are to
get you down to Mars. At any cost.

Roger reaches Goddard. Lifts him off the floor, and pins
him against a tank. Hard. Goddard grimaces with pain:

- GODDARD
The one thing I'm not sure of yet
is whether you've been programmed
to kill me too...

Roger raises his fist into the air as if about to strike.
Goddard flinches before the blow. But he keeps talking:

GODDARD (cont'd)
...or if you're just supposed to
frighten me into obeying orders.

Goddard closes his eyes. But nothing happens. He opens
them. Roger has unclenched his fist. After a moment, he
lowers him to the floor. Goddard falls back against the
tank. Bent over a little at the waist. BREATHING hard.

GODDARD
Yeah. Of course. Keep the pilot.

CLOSE-UP of ROGER. For the first time there is a hint of
expression there. Pain. He fights to get out the words:

ROGER
HHEHHHHHHHHHHHHELP MEEEREEEEEEEEEEE.

Goddard stares up at Roger. As if they are both damned.

GODDARD
I'm sorry, Colonel. But there's
nothing I can do for you. We've
got a burn coming up. You need
to take care of the priest. Now.

Roger stands there for a moment. His wings RUSTLING.
Then he abruptly turns...and DISAPPEARS INTO THE STEAM.

EXT--DEEP IN OUTER SPACE~--DAY

An OPENING appears on the BOOSTER MODULE spewing BRIGHT
LIGHT into space. ROGER climbs out. Just a DEMON SHADOW
in the middle of the light. Perched on the side of the
booster with his wings gathered around him. Roger leaps.

Roger floats in space and HIS WINGS UNFURL to their full
length. Like an enormous space bat. Immediately the
STARS STOP SPINNING and behind him the BOOSTER RECEDES
INTO THE DISTANCE. Roger hangs in space. His EYES GLOW.

Nothing. And then, a GLINT OF METAL appears. Becoming
the COMMAND MODULE making its sweep through space. Roger
floating directly in its path. Suddenly, he looks tiny.

The command module sweeps past TAKING ROGER WITH IT. On
the outside of the ship, Roger slides across the surface
clawing for a grip--the METAL CRUMPLING as he grabs hold.
The ship continues on. A winged passenger on its back.

EXT--DEEP IN OUTER SPACE--DAY

SULIE floats alone in space. No sound but her BREATHING.
Spinning a little. She stares out her visor. With the
vacant stare of the dead. Then, her eyes seem to focus.

In the distance SOMETHING IS BLOCKING OUT THE STARS. It
gets larger. Larger. The TETHER LINE. Moving through
space without an apparent beginning or end. The cable
grows thicker. Barreling toward the defenseless Sulie.

The TETHER PASSES UNDER HER disappearing in the distance
as quickly as it appeared. Sulie hangs in space. Alone.
But it is clear from her expression that she is thinking.

INT--ON THE SCIENCE LEVEL--DAY

FATHER KAYMAN paces back-and-forth looking helpless. He
turns as he notices a GREEN LIGHT FLASHING. Kayman steps

inside MISSION CONTROL. He is pleasant and professional.

TECHNICIAN
Mariner, Houston here. Received
your transmission and we confirm
your EVA to the booster--glad to
see Colonel Torraway is working
out. Best of luck. Houston out.

And the IMAGE BLIPS OFF. Kayman stares at the screen,
like he doesn't know whether to laugh or cry. Behind him
the PORTHOLE IS VISIBLE. Nothing but SPIRALING STARS on
the other side. Then ROGER APPEARS. Crawling across the
outside of the ship. Roger stops and stares through the
porthole at Kayman. RED EYES GLOWING. After a moment he
crawls away. Kayman turns toward the porthole just as
Roger disappears from view. The Priest never sees him.

EXT--DEEP IN OUTER SPACE--DAY

SULIE is snapping into place a flimsy-looking device that
geems to semble from her belt. Arms, handgrips, and
what appear to be tiny jets: an EMERGENCY THRUSTER PACK.
Sulie locks the grips into position...and looks surprised
as she hears a RIDICULOUSLY-PLEASANT FEMALE VOICE begin:

 

FEMALE VOICE
Hello! You have assembled your
emergency thruster pack. You now
have 15 seconds of maneuvering
thrusters available!

Sulie hesitates, as if nervous. Then her thumb depresses
one of the grips and a FLASH OF WHITE HEAT from the jets
sends her into a VICIOUS SPIN. Her BREATHING gets faster
and faster as she spins. Her other thumb depresses its
grip, and an OPPOSING BURST slows her. Stops the spin.

FEMALE VOICE
Hello! You now have 8 seconds of
maneuvering thrusters available!

Sulie looks terrified. BREATHING. She steadies herself.
Hits one grip, and then the other. Managing to turn
herself completely around and to steady herself in place:

FEMALE VOICE
Hello! You now have 4 seconds of
maneuvering thrusters available!
Sulie looks close to passing out. SWEAT pouring down her

face. She shakes her head. Straining her eyes to see:

SULIE'S P.O.V. Her visor is FOGGED. BREATHING deafening
inside her helmet. Something is coming now: THE TETHER.

Sulie HITS THE THRUSTERS and DROPS DOWN INTO THE PATH of
the cable hurling closer. For a moment it looks like she
will reach it, but then it becomes clear that Sulie has
timed her maneuver incorrectly and is FLOATING TOO LOW.

FEMALE VOICE
Hello! You are out of maneuvering
thrusters. Sorry!

Inside her helmet, Sulie looks frantic. The tether about
to pass above her. She reaches for a device strapped to
her leg. It snaps free and immediately expands into the
shape of a HOOK. Sulie stretches her arm. The HOOK
CATCHES THE CABLE and the UNIVERSE STARTS SPINNING wildly
around her as Sulie is dragged along behind the tether.

INT--THE COMMAND MODULE--DAY

FATHER KAYMAN frowns at the MANUALS open in front of him
as he moves switches on a COMPUTER TERMINAL. Wiping the
SWEAT from his face. He loses his place in one book, and
furiously flips pages to find it. Hitting more switches.

THE SCREEN runs a DIAGRAM OF THE SHIP HIGHLIGHTING SPOTS
along the tether. "TETHER DISCONNECT" flashing. Then a
GRAPHIC OF AN ORBITAL APPROACH plays showing the COMMAND
MODULE ENTERING ORBIT AROUND MARS with: "ORBITAL LOCK."

A PANEL SLIDES OPEN and a LARGE RED BUTTON emerges from
the terminal covered by a PROTECTIVE SHIELD. The Priest
reads the manual. Uses a KEY to unlock and pull it down.
Kayman steps back. As if away from that big red button.

KAYMAN
(into his headset)
Hello? Is anybody reading me?

ROGER'S VOICE
YESSSSSSSSSSSSS.

Kayman turns to see ROGER in the shadows. His RED EYES
are visible. The tip of his WINGS extend into the light.

KAYMAN
Roger. What's going on?

ROGER
RRRRRRRRRRRRRRUN AWAYYYYYYYYYYYY.

(CONTINUED)
107
CONTINUED:

Roger steps from the shadows. His FACE SHOWS EMOTION. A
look of great pain and anguish beneath his glowing eyes.

ROGER
(more human than before)
Rrrun away. Before I kill yyyyou.

Father Kayman looks too terrified to move. Then he takes
one step to the side and DROPS THROUGH THE HOLE TO THE
LEVEL BELOW. The Priest hits the floor hard and GRUNTS.
Rolls. He rises to his feet as ROGER DROPS DOWN BEHIND
HIM. His wings following him like a great predator bird.
Kayman scrambles to a hole, and DROPS INTO THE COCKPIT.

He falls past the seats, landing brutally on top of the
control panel directly between two PORTHOLES revealing
the SPIRALING STARS. Kayman is at the tip of the ship,
with nowhere else to go. He looks up. Nothing. Then
ROGER APPEARS. Hanging over the cockpit opening like an
animal. Getting ready to leap. Kayman looks terrified.

His fingers frantically search the console for a SWITCH.
Finding it. Kayman SLAMS HIS FIST DOWN. Roger makes a
move to swoop down but the BULKHEAD SLIDES CLOSED. Roger
hits it with a DEAFENING DOOM. Kayman watches the METAL
CRUMPLE as Roger punches from the other side. DOOOQOOOM.

EXT--DEEP IN OUTER SPACE--DAY

SULIE rests on top of the TETHER LINE. Hanging onto the
thick cable, like a child to an inner tube. No sound but
her BREATHING. All around her THE UNIVERSE IS SPINNING.

Sulie begins to crawl. The tether seems endless, and her
BREATHING is strained. Sulie stops at a HATCH set in the
cable with an INSET KNOB. She wipes the THICK DUST away.

Sulie leans close to READ THE INSTRUCTIONS. She reaches
a gloved hand into the recess and tries to turn the knob.
No sound but her heavy BREATHING. The knob won't budge.

Sulie pauses to rest, and then her body seems to stiffen:

SULIE'S P.O.V. The visor is so badly fogged it is almost
impenetrable. Her BREATHING DEAFENING. But, through the
fog, there is movement: GODDARD riding the tether line.

Sulie reads the instructions again, her BREATHING getting
frantic. Using both hands on the knob. It turns. The
PANEL OPENS revealing the HOLLOW INTERIOR OF THE TETHER.

Sulie clumsily scrambles to maneuver her thick spacesuit
through the small opening and down into the hollow cable.
108

INT--THRU THE TETHER LINE--DAY

SULIE finds herself inside a long, dark, METAL TUNNEL.
No light except that coming from the open panel above her
and the ILLUMINATION FROM HER SPACESUIT. Her VISOR TURNS
CLEAR and, through the fogged glass, her face is visible.

Sulie's expression hardens. She begins to pull herself
through the cable. Like a combination of crawling and
floating. Not much room. It looks incredibly difficult.
Her tortured BREATHING coming in between her movements.

Sulie pulls herself along. The DIM YELLOW LIGHTS on the
spacesuit illuminating only a few feet in front of her.

EXT--DEEP IN OUTER SPACE--DAY

GODDARD rides the tether. His gloved hands gripping the
controls. He stops the rider, and leans over. REFLECTED
IN HIS VISOR is the distorted image of the OPEN PANEL in
the cable. His thick gloves squeeze the controls and the
tether speeds over the opening. Further. Still further.
Suddenly, Goddard stops the rider. Dismounts. Dropping
to his knees onto the tether and bending over something:
a SECOND ACCESS PANEL leading to the inside of the cable.

INT--THE COMMAND MODULE--DAY

DOOOM. The BULKHEAD BENDS as Roger strikes it again from
the other side. Won't last much longer. FATHER KAYMAN
looks around, frantically. He spots an AIR VENT in what
from his point-of-view is the ceiling. Big enough for a
person? Kayman hurries to the grill, and pulls it loose.

INT--INSIDE AN AIR VENT--DAY

KAYMAN puts his foot on a chair, and hoists himself into
the vent. Tight. Incredibly tight. The Priest grimaces
as he hugs the walls of the shaft to pull himself inside.
There is an incredible WRENCHING SOUND and ROGER appears.
Staring up into the vent after Kayman with inhuman eyes.

Kayman pulls himself through. Passing a GRILLED OPENING:

KAYMAN'S P.O.V. Looking through the grill out onto the
LIVING QUARTERS. Suddenly, Roger leaps through the hole
in the floor up from the cockpit. Crouching for a moment
like a predator. Then running for the vent and Kayman.

The Priest frantically pulls himself up the shaft just as
Roger makes contact and the METAL BELOW HIM CRUMPLES.

(CONTINUED)
109
CONTINUED:

Part of ROGER'S ARM AND WING HAVE BROKEN THROUGH. They
look stuck. Roger struggling to get free and releasing a
DEAFENING INHUMAN SHRIEK. Kayman keeps crawling, faster.

INT--THE LIVING QUARTERS--DAY

ROGER is stuck. He claws at the metal...until suddenly
his hand stops in mid-air, shaking, as if Roger's trying
to stop his arm. Roger stumbles loose from the wall.
Jerking wildly like he can't control his body. He stops
himself in the center of the room. Standing there like a
man with the shakes. Suddenly, he sping crazily and his
WINGS EXPAND SLICING AND SCRAPING THE WALLS. Again Roger
manages to stop himself. His face showing the struggle:

ROGER
SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSTOP.

Roger falls to his knees. His expression suddenly quite
human. He looks frantic. Like he knows he doesn't have
much time. Roger reaches over his shoulder and tries to
get at the RECTANGULAR SHAPE IN HIS LOWER BACK. He can't
reach it. Seems to get angry. Roger stands and hurls
himself backwards CRASHING INTO THE BULKHEAD. Again and
again and again. As if attempting to smash his computer.

CLOSE-UP of the COMPUTER ON HIS BACK. Being BENT a bit.
Some of the RED TILES coming loose revealing SILVER METAL
underneath. Another CRASH, and ELECTRONICS are visible.
INT--ON THE SCIENCE LEVEL--DAY
FATHER KAYMAN appears behind the grill on the wall. He
grabs the grate, pushes, and tumbles out onto the floor.
INT--THE LIVING QUARTERS --DAY
At the sound of the MUTED THUD from above, ROGER freezes.
Like an animal that's just detected prey. His expression
becomes lifeless again as he immediately rushes forward.
INT--ON THE SCIENCE LEVEL--DAY
FATHER KAYMAN extends his hand toward the big RED BUTTON.
KAYMAN
(as if in prayer)

Forgive me....

Kayman presses the button. Immediately FIVE ROUND LIGHTS

ACTIVATE beside the switch. The FIFTH LIGHT GOES DARK
accompanied by a BEEEEP. Like a timer. Or, a countdown.

ROGER LEAPS UP THROUGH THE FLOOR. Father Kayman turns,
looking terrified. Roger grabs him by his flight suit
and THROWS HIM ACROSS THE ROOM like a rag doll. Kayman
hits the bulkhead, and crumples lifelessly to the floor.

INT--THRU THE TETHER LINE--DAY

Exhausted BREATHING. SULIE crawls through the cable, the
dim lights illuminating only a few feet in front of her.

INT--ON THE SCIENCE LEVEL--DAY
FATHER KAYMAN lies motionless. ROGER moving toward him.

CLOSE-UP of those FIVE LIGHTS. The fifth is out and now
so is the fourth. The THIRD LIGHT GOES OUT to a BEEEEEP.

INT--THRU THE TETHER LINE--DAY

SULIE crawls. Her helmet lights illuminate nothing but
the same endless metal walls. She crawls. BREATHING.
Suddenly, the dim yellow light reveals GODDARD two feet
in front of her. His grim face visible through his
helmet bubble. Looking foreboding in the sickly light.

INT--ON THE SCIENCE LEVEL-~-DAY

ROGER crouches before FATHER KAYMAN. His wings stretched
around and above him. Like a gargoyle. He moves ever so
slightly. As if Roger is getting ready to jump. Kayman
begins to stir, face grimacing in pain. He sees Roger.
Kayman raises his arms up over his face as Roger leaps.

CLOSE-UP of the TERMINAL. Four lights dim. The LAST
LIGHT BLINKS OUT with a BEEP and the ENTIRE SHIP RUMBLES.

The craft violently tilts and Father Kayman slides across
the floor. Roger's jump is thrown off and he CRASHES
INTO A CONTROL PANEL, smashing it, as ship ALARMS GO OFF.

INT--THRU THE TETHER LINE--DAY

GODDARD reaches for SULIE as the TETHER LINE CRACKS OPEN
beneath him. The harsh light of outer space illuminates
Goddard's terrified face before his VISOR DARKENS and
REFLECTS THE STARS. The opening in the tether widens and

Goddard almost tumbles out. He grabs for a hold. His
legs stuck inside one half of the tether--and his arms
holding on to the other half. Like a Saturday cartoon.

Sulie sees her opportunity and frantically CRAWLS ACROSS
GODDARD'S BACK. Using his body as a bridge across open
space. Sulie pulls herself inside the other half of the
severed tether line as GODDARD SPIRALS OUT INTO THE VOID.

Sulie BREATHES faster. Faster. Crawling away from the
endless SPINNING UNIVERSE at the end of the gaping hole.

EXT--DEEP IN OUTER SPACE--DAY

The MANEUVERING THRUSTERS on the COMMAND MODULE engage
releasing SHORT BURSTS OF WHITE HEAT. The module rolls.

INT--THRU THE TETHER LINE--DAY

SULIE grabs for a handhold as the INTERIOR OF THE CABLE
RUSHES FURIOUSLY PAST HER. Behind Sulie the OPEN END of
the tether races closer. Closer. Just as she is about
to be hurled into space Sulie raises that METAL HOOK,
dragging the tip along the inside of the cable to SPARKS.

There doesn't seem to be anything for it to grab onto.
OPEN SPACE RUSHES CLOSER. Suddenly the HOOK CATCHES ON A
JOINT--and stops--but so quickly that Sulie cannot keep a
grip. Her thick GLOVE SLIDES DOWN THE HANDLE. And off.

Sulie releases a TERRIFIED SCREAM as she TUMBLES OUT INTO
SPACE. For a moment, all looks lost...until she suddenly
JERKS TO A STOP. There is a THIN SAFETY WIRE connecting
the handle of the hook to its compartment on Sulie's
THIGH. She dangles helplessly, trailing behind the ship.

INT--THE COMMAND MODULE--DAY

The module is DARK. The LIGHTS FURIOUSLY BLINKING on the
face of the computer creating the illusion of a WILD
STROBE. ROGER is tangled inside the remains of the panel
he collided with. He rips the metal like paper. FATHER
KAYMAN is crumpled in the far corner. He begins to stir.

The computer SCREEN displays some GRAPHICS OF THE COMMAND
MODULE. Separated from the booster module, and clearly
trailing a section of the tether. The words "TETHER
DISCONNECT COMPLETE" appear, and then "ORBITAL APPROACH."

Roger pulls a TWISTED CHUNK OF METAL FREE and tosses it
aside. His GLOWING EYES scan the interior. Spot Kayman.

(CONTINUED)
112
CONTINUED:

CLOSE-UP of a SPEAKER set into the face of the computer:

ARTIFICIAL VOICE
Zero-gravity in three seconds.

Father Kayman opens his eyes. Sees Roger moving toward
him. The STROBE EFFECT from the blinking computer bathes
the entire capsule alternately in deep DARKNESS followed
by a moment of harsh LIGHT. Roger is nothing but TWO RED
EYES in the darkness. A DEMON come to life in the light.
With each burst of the light Roger is closer, and closer.

Kayman lays there. Dazed. Then his expression changes:

KAYMAN'S P.O.V. The capsule goes DARK again. Roger is
nothing but a set of EYES. When the LIGHTS come back,
Kayman does not see Roger: In his delirium the Priest
sees SATAN--the Devil himself--with EXAGGERATED FEATURES
AND TWO RED HORNS. The Devil's hideous mouth opens in a
grotesque grin. Gesturing. AS IF BECKONING THE PRIEST.

Kayman looks terrified. Eyes wide. Then his face twists
in defiance. In anger and disgust. The Priest screams:

KAYMAN
NO0000000000000000000000000000000 !

CLOSE-UP of the SPEAKER set in the face of the computer:

ARTIFICIAL VOICE
Zero-gravity.

EVERY LOOSE ITEM in the capsule suddenly RISES INTO THE
AIR. SPOONS and PAPERS. CHUNKS OF METAL Roger tore off.

ROGER IS LIFTED OFF OF THE FLOOR. His WINGS FLAP wildly
sending FLOATING OBJECTS HURLING ACROSS THE CAPSULE. He
flails in mid-air. Helpless. Kayman rises off the floor
too, but manages to steady himself against the bulkhead
behind him. The Priest is still wearing a crazed face as
he suddenly PUSHES OFF FROM THE BULKHEAD floating through
the debris and PLUCKING A SPIRALING FORK OUT OF THE AIR.

Kayman strikes Roger in the back and they both TUMBLE OFF
THROUGH THE COMPARTMENT. End-over-end. Roger's WINGS
LOOKING WILD. Like a bat's wings. The Priest holding on
for dear life as he plunges the fork into Roger's back
again and again SCREAMING like a madman. His blows land
fruitlessly against Roger's hard red tiles. But every so
often the Priest manages to hit the EXPOSED ELECTRONICS.

Roger and Kayman strike a wall TUMBLING OFF THE OTHER WAY
through the debris, the Priest plunging the fork into the

ROGER
Thank you, Father.

Kayman stops. Holding onto Roger's shoulders, like a boy
getting a piggy-back ride from his father. They tumble,
gently, through the different levels of the ship. Those
great wings under control. ROGER'S FACE HAS EXPRESSION:

ROGER (cont'd)
I think that will do, very nicely.

Roger EXTENDS HIS WINGS. Making contact with the walls
to stop their tumbling. Father Kayman looks stunned, but
relieved. The INNER METALLIC EYELIDS CLOSE over Roger's
eyes to a WHIRRING. And when they open, the red glowing
lenses have been replaced by Roger's REGULAR HUMAN EYES.

Suddenly the silence is broken--as a KLAXON SOUNDS. They
both turn to look at the cosmic storm terminal. The
words "INCOMING RADIATION" still flashing, as before, but
now that TIMER reads: 00:00:30. Thirty seconds to go.

ROGER
Solar flare coming in--we better
get you into the shelter, Father.
Roger begins to make a move...and that's when they hear
it. Over the RADIO. It is so faint, and buried in the
middle of so much STATIC, the sound can almost be missed:

SULIE'S VOICE

KAYMAN

SULIE dangles at the end of her safety line. Inside her
helmet, she is barely alert, sweat rushing down her face.

ROGER grabs a handful of wires, turning toward the outer
door. His INNER METALLIC EYELIDS close and, when they
open, Roger is staring out with TELESCOPIC LENSES. He
jerks the wires loose. The OUTER DOOR BLOWS OPEN with a
DEAFENING RUSH OF AIR as Roger is BLOWN OUT INTO SPACE.

EXT--DEEP IN OUTER SPACE--DAY

The COMMAND MODULE recedes into the distance behind ROGER
as he is blown down the length of the tether. His WINGS
EXPANDING to their full size. EYES REFLECTING THE STARS.
INSIDE SULIE'S HELMET. SULIE opens her eyes just barely:
SULIE'S P.O.V. Through her fogged helmet visor, Roger is
visible. Like some great winged creature out of myth,
emerging from the heavy mist. Flying closer and closer.
Roger reaches Sulie, and takes her into his arms. Pulis
her close. Engulfing her. ENORMOUS WINGS FOLDING AROUND
HER. Encasing Sulie. Wrapping around them both with a
precision and a gentleness of touch not seen before now.

CLOSE-UP of the TIMER as the counter scrolls to 00:00:00.

FATHER KAYMAN waits inside the cosmic ray shelter. Seems
to pray as he does. Suddenly, the DOOR AUTOMATICALLY
OPENS. The Priest looks relieved, and starts out, when
the SHELTER PORTHOLE SLIDES OPEN. Kayman rushes to the
porthole. He wipes the perspiration away, and peers out.

CAMERA'S P.O.V. LOOKING IN FROM OUTSIDE THE SPACESHIP:
Through the small perspiring porthole, Father Kayman is
visible, wiping the glass, and trying to see through. He
squints. And then he sees them. The Priest stares into
space, with an expression of surprise, and profound joy:

KAYMAN'S P.O.V. Through the sweating porthole the tiny

figure of ROGER is visible. Looking like some beautiful,
strange thing. His gossamer wings wrapped around Sulie.

INT--INSIDE OF HIS WINGS~-DAY
Roger's wings look soft and comfortable when pressed up
against the bubble of her helmet. SULIE looks around, as
if only now realizing where exactly this is. She smiles.
SULIE
Hey. Did we make it...to Mars?
EXT- -DEEP IN OUTER SPACE--DAY

TWO TINY PLANETS are REFLECTED IN ROGER'S LENSES. One
MARS in each lens. Right where his human eyes should be.

KAYMAN
Looks like we'll have enough power
for the two of us, Rog. Of course
you don't breathe...so that helps.

Roger does not respond. Just crouched on the chair, with
his back toward them. Not moving. His WINGS RUSTLING.
Kayman and Sulie share a nervous look. Waiting a moment.

SULIE
(as if afraid to know)
You are coming home with us, right?

Roger turns around and flashes them with a cocky smile.
The face of a test pilot. Explorer. An
Roger doesn't say a single word...but he doesn't need to.

INT--INSIDE THE AIRLOCK~-DAY

The OUTER AIRLOCK DOOR OPENS above the SURFACE OF MARS
far below. ROGER crouches at the edge of the airlock.
REFLECTIVE LIGHT FROM THE SURFACE bathes the airlock and
Roger seems to GLOW. His skin,. eyes, and wings catch the
red, looking truly luminescent. We have never seen him
like this. Above the world the "Man Plus" was made for.

INT--INSIDE THE COCKPIT--DAY

FATHER KAYMAN and SULIE are strapped in the pilot seats.
Through the cockpit portholes, a CABLE IS VISIBLE rising
up from the planet, like an enormous pillar to the stars.

Sulie and Kayman share a glance. Sulie touches her mike:

SULIE
On my mark, Roger....GO!

EXT--IN ORBIT ABOVE MARS--DAY

ROGER leaps from the airlock and FLOATS OUT OVER THE
PLANET like a skydiver from space, HIS WINGS UNFOLDING to
their full length. Beneath Roger the barren landscape
RUSHES PAST IN A FURIOUS RED BLUR. Roger has his arms
outstretched and, suddenly, the CABLE APPEARS UNDER HIM.

Roger grabs the top of the cable, and the PLANET STOPS
MOVING. Roger hangs in a stationary position above Mars,
the EARTH SHIP RECEDING into the distance as it continues

red world on a cable that stretches all the way down to
the surface, disappearing from view long before it ever
reaches the Martian soil it's planted in. Roger's tiled
body SHIMMERS WITH RED. His EYES REFLECTING THE SURFACE.

Roger pulls himself up beside the cable. Rests his feet
on a PLATFORM. Immediately, IT BEGINS TO DESCEND. Roger
perched on the cable, his wings gathered around and above
him. Like a gargoyle overlooking his own personal world.
Descending to the barren surface a hundred miles below.

FATHER KAYMAN and SULIE huddle by the porthole watching
Roger descend as Kayman recites the ordinary of the mass:

EXT--MARS--BROADCAST FOOTAGE

MARS FOOTAGE PLAYS. A bit FUZZY. The barren landscape
stretching off toward an alien horizon. In the middle of
this picture is a SPACECRAFT. Like the old conventional
Apollo lunar modules. The DOOR OPENS and an ASTRONAUT IN
A SPACESUIT slowly emerges. Descending to the surface.

TWO COMMENTATORS begin to speak in hushed, excited tones:

COMMENTATOR 1 (V.0O.)
Ladies and gentlemen, you are about
to witness the first step taken on
another planet. What do you think
Col. Torraway is going to say, Bob?

COMMENTATOR 2 (V.O.)
I don't know, Chet. But there has
been talk that he'll echo the words
spoken by astronaut Neil Armstrong
when he first stepped onto the moon.

The Commentators hush as the Astronaut descends down to
the surface. The spacesuited figure that's supposed to
be Roger landing on Mars reaches the bottom of the ladder
and waits for what is supposed to be a dramatic moment.
He sets one boot onto the Martian soil. Then the other.

EXT--THE SURFACE OF MARS--DAY

ROGER rides the enormous cable down toward the surface of
Mars. Eyes red. Wings gathered around and above him.
His skin luminescent. Roger looks joyous. Smiling wide.

TELEVISED ROGER (V.0O.)
That's one small step for a man...

Roger nears the surface and LEAPS OFF the platform. He
GLIDES THROUGH THE PINK MARTIAN AIR with his WINGS
OUTSTRETCHED. Roger hits the ground, but raises only a
TINY CLOUD OF RED DUST as he bounds off toward the
horizon, moving steadily away with sudden ENORMOUS LEAPS.

TELEVISED ROGER (V.O.)
.«..one giant leap for mankind.

Roger continues on toward the horizon. If he looks like
anything, it would be an indigenous Martian life-form.
His wings balance him as he lands atop a misshapen red
BOULDER before leaping off and dropping down out of view.

The same type of print the astronauts left on the moon.

CUT TO:

The barren Martian landscape stretches on toward a jagged
red horizon. There is no movement now. Roger is gone.

CAMERA MOVES, down. To the actual FIRST FOOTPRINT ever
made in the virgin red soil. It resembles nothing like
the boot print the world is watching on television.
Nothing like any boot print at all. THREE LARGE INHUMAN
TOES--Roger's toes--protrude from the front of what looks
like an alien foot, the HEEL DUG SO DEEP. Like a claw.

A Martian footprint in the red dust.
