the number 23

an original screenplay written by

Fernley Phillips

November 4, 2002
FADE IN:
EXT. MARSH - DEAD OF NIGHT

A signpost reads: "THE STEPS TO HEAVEN." Below it, another
adds: "WARNING: UNSAFE FOOTING. DON'T STRAY OFF THE PATH."
Beyond them, STEPPING STONES disappear into darkness.

The WIND picks up as we head into the marsh. Listen to it.
It carries INDISTINCT, TROUBLED WHISPERINGS.

A DOG, a 95-lb pit bull, 90 of which is pure terrifying
muscle, sits on a stone halfway across. An ANTIQUE SILVER
COLLAR glints around its neck and its eyes... its eyes are a
black, bottomless void. The whispers SWIRL AROUND it, getting
louder and louder, and more and more troubled...

DISSOLVE TO:
A RED SCREEN. ODD...
-..it seems alive. Moving. Flowing.

WALTER (V.0O.)
"You can call me Fingerling. It's
not my real name, but comes from a
book I read as a child, 'Fingerling
at the Zoo.' Paper flap long gone,
it had a green, hardback cover and
mottled texture, and was possibly my
very first book. Funny, I can't recall
what it was about, the only thing I
remember is the name. 'Fingerling.'
I wished it was mine. Now it is,”

WIDER ANGLE: WALTER SPARROW lies on his back in a cobblestoned
road, staring at the BLOOD seeping from his head.

As we PULL UP {looking down on Walter), we might notice the
specific paths his blood has chosen through the cobblestones,
pathways that depict a number...

...the number 23.

SUPER UP: FEBRUARY 10

Suddenly, the screen BLURS as images {THE MOVIE IN REVERSE
FLASH PAST SUPER FAST-MO. The date COUNTS DOWN, stopping at:

SUPER UP: FEBRUARY 3
NORMAL SPEED: a WOMAN walks her BULLDOG down a STREET.

She stops for some aimless window shopping. A cat MEOWS. The
dog turns and stares.
The woman moves on but the dog won't budge. She tugs on the
leash. It GROWLS. She follows its stare to Walter, sitting

in a truck, half-eaten pastrami sandwich in hands. He's
staring right back at the dog.

Walter MEOWS. The dog BARKS.

The woman, shocked, notices the words "ANIMAL CONTROL OFFICER"
engraved on the truck's side. Suddenly fearful, she checks
her leash and pulls the dog away.

Walter MEOWS once more, then chuckles and resumes his lunch.
INT, TRUCK - LATE AFTERNOON

Stuck in traffic. The dashboard clock reads 4:58 p.m. Walter's
CB radio CRACKLES into life. A female voice:

RADIO
Unit 5, come in. We have a U.S.S.

Walter stares at the clock. It clicks to 4:59.
WALTER (V.0.)
I'd never thought much about destiny,

but, maybe this was mine. Then again,
things didn't really start here...

The screen BLURS once more as we FAST-MO BACK IN TIME to:
SUPER UP: DECEMBER 23 (43 DAYS EARLIER)

NORMAL SPEED: LIGHTS flash on a stunning CHRISTMAS TREE,
We're in a HALLWAY at EVENING-TIME.

Walter stares into a tinsel-edged, snow-dusted mirror,
uncomfortable in suit and tie.

ROBIN SPARROW, Walter's son and best friend, comes upstairs,
Juggling. .

WALTER
How do I look?

ROBIN
The truth?

WALTER

Are you kidding?

ROBIN
You look great.

WALTER
Thank you.
INT. BEDROOM - EVENING
Walter speaks to the bathroom door:

WALTER
How are we doing in there?

The door opens. AGATHA SPARROW blows into a tissue, her red
eyes and runny nose failing to diminish her sexiness. She's
in her underwear.

WALTER
I see.
AGATHA
I think you may be going alone.
{a beat)

Do you hate me?
WALTER
{looks her up and down)
As much now as the day I met you.

He fondles her neck, giving her goose bumps. All these years
of marriage and she still gets the bumps.

AGATHA
I might be contagious.

WALTER
I might be immune.

His hand moves lower.

AGATHA
What about the party?

WALTER
Like anyone's going to miss me.

AGATHA
What about the cake?

WALTER (V.O.}
I'd like two words on my tombstone:
"What if?"
INT. TRUCK - NIGHT

Walter passes drunk Yuletide revelers. A large CAKE BOX is
on his passenger seat.

WALTER (V.0O.)
What if I'd said screw the cake?
EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Snowflakes are falling as Walter walks past CAROL-SINGERS,
cake in arms. He enters a PUB, the "MAN'S BEST FRIEND."

INT. "MAN'S BEST FRIEND" - PRIVATE FUNCTION ROOM - NIGHT

The local ACO's Christmas party. A small BAND (each member
dressed like Father Christmas) sets up.

Walter adds the cake (a Dalmatian pup in Santa hat) to the
table. SYBIL, an aging man-eater with too much make-up and
well-endowed bosom barely contained by a red dress, sidles up.

SYBIL
Single tonight, Walter?

She pulls a SPRIG OF MISTLETOE from the depths of her bosom.

WALTER (V.0O.)
What if Agatha had come?

LATER - THE DANCE FLOOR
is where it's happening. Alcohol has been consumed.

Walter sits alone with a slice of cake. Sybil drags him onto
the floor and throws her arms around him. Her clutch tightens.
She whispers into his ear. He stares at her, horrified. She
whispers again. He breaks away.

WALTER (V.O.)
What if I'd only been a bit more...

WALTER
Sybil, I--
{the song ends}
--wouldn't "wag my tail" with you in
the cloakroom if I was in heat and
you were the last "bitch" on Earth.

Everyone stops and stares. Stares become laughs and sniggers.

WALTER (V.O.)
...tactful? Quieter, even?

INT. TRUCK - LATE AFTERNOON (FEBRUARY 3)
Walter stares at the clock.

SYBIL'S VOICE
Do you read me, Unit 5? I repeat, we
have an undesirable scavenger
sighting. Walter Sparrow, I know
you're there.
He grabs the radio.

WALTER
It's one minute to five, Sybil!

INT. ACO HQ - SAME
Sybil mans the dispatch.
SYBIL
Then we're agreed: you're still on
duty. Happy fucking birthday.
EXT. WANTON PLEASURE RESTAURANT - EVENING
An undesirable part of Chinatown.

INT. WANTON PLEASURE - EVENING

An old CHINESE MAN leads Walter via the kitchen to the back
door. He nods at it, afraid. Walter pushes it open.

GRRR.
EXT, WANTON PLEASURE - EVENING

Walter straps on PROTECTIVE SLEEVES. He pulls a MUZZLE and
FLASHLIGHT from his truck, then a DOG POLE. Tests it. It works.

He checks the time. Mutters.

EXT. ALLEYWAY - EVENING

The only working street lamp flickers and dies.

Walter flips on the flashlight. A sign reads: DEAD END. He
points the beam to the end: a ragged, brick wall. No dog. A
line of DUMPSTERS provides plenty of lurking spaces.

Walter inches down, pole at the ready, like a cop. He nears
the end. Stops.

WALTER
Meow.

GRRR.
He smiles. Moves onward,

The PIT BULL (seen earlier) waits between two dumpsters. It
bares its teeth, eyes dripping with evil, glinting in the light.

WALTER
Man's best friend, my ass.
6.

Walter switches the flashlight to WIDE BEAM and puts it down.
He extends the pole and steps forward.

WALTER
Come to daddy.

The dog SNARLS, backs against the wall, and BARKS.

WALTER
Feisty little foe, aren't you? Perhaps
you'd like to hear a story?

He recounts the following in LOVING STYLE, adding SUBTLE
GESTURES, luliing the curious canine into a false sense of
security. (PARTS OF THIS SHALL BE ANIMATED)

WALTER
Once upon a time there lived a dog.
Now this dog led a life of terror,
fearing no one, but over time he
realized, though his teeth were sharp
and belly full, his heart was empty.
He wanted a friend.

He starts inching strategically forward.

WALTER

Alas, all the other animals feared
this four-legged fiend so he set off,
journeying this way and that, to lands
far, far away, hoping to find someone
who knew not of his reputation. One
day he happened upon a small, wooden
shack with a smokeless chimney above.

He suspends the pole above the dog.

WALTER
The door hung open and inside sat an
old, thin man. His lonely eyes matched
the dog's heart and when he beckoned
it in the dog was overjoyed. That
night, smoke drifted out the chimney,
but oh, what odd-smelling smoke this
was. You see, the land was China, and
in China...

In one swift movement, Walter whips the pole down, the draw
string falling around the dog's neck. He yanks it tight.

WALTER
...-THEY EAT DOGS!

The dog SNARLS and BARKS. Walter pulls out the muzzle and
waits. His prisoner calms.
WALTER
The moral of this story, you ask?

He strokes the dog's head. A NAME TAG dangles from its collar.
WALTER
Stay out of goddamn Chinatown, my
dear...
He turns the tag over.

WALTER
-Ned.

NED clamps its teeth over his arm. Walter HOWLS. Ned won't
let go.

He loosens the draw string. Ned releases his jaws, tugs his
head free and bolts. Blood seeps through Walter's sleeve.

EXT. STREET - EVENING

Walter storms out of the alley, sees Ned fifty yards away,
staring at him.

WALTER
So you didn't like my story, huh?
Fine. I can take criticism.

He throws his stuff in the truck and pulls out a TRANQUILIZER
GUN. Loads it. Marches towards his foe.

Ned runs. Walter runs after him.

EXT. CAKE SHOP - EVENING

Agatha locks up for the night and hurries off.

INTERCUT: WALTER CHASING NED / AGATHA WAITING FOR WALTER

-- Ned bounds into a UNIVERSITY CAR PARK, waits for Walter
to catch up, then bounds off again, like he's playing a game.

-- Agatha browses STALLS in a quaint MARKET SQUARE, TRADERS
are packing up for the day.

-- Ned races down a street, stopping in front of a LIGHT BLUE
APARTMENT BUILDING. Walter approaches. Ned races off.

~- Agatha waits beneath a lamppost, the market now a ghost
town.

-- Walter approaches Ned, waiting for him in front of a BUS.
The bus suddenly pulls away revealing a ROAD SIGN for
"CASANOVA'S PARK." Ned races off.
8.

-~ Agatha checks the time. Shivers. Glances about the square
at the SHOPS around the perimeter.

~~ Ned pauses at the foot of A STEEP FLIGHT OF STEPS. Checks
Walter is still in pursuit. He is.

-~ Agatha browses aisles in a SECONDHAND BOOKSTORE. A BOOK
falls off a shelf right in her path, startling her.

EXT. STREET - EVENING

Walter turns a corner, puffing, and falls to his knees. Ned
stands a few yards away, beside the PINK NEON SIGN of "THE
SHELL” HOTEL (though the 'S' of Shell is unlit so the name
appears "HELL"). A board reads: "VACANCY."

WALTER
I'll give you Hell, alright.
(aiming)
Sweet dreams, furball.

Ned runs into the road. A car BLASTS its horn, SCREECHES to
a halt. It moves on. The road...

WALTER (V.O.)
There are so many what ifs.

...is empty, Ned staring at him from a CHURCH across the
street, It BARKS. Enters the GRAVEYARD.

EXT. GRAVEYARD - EVENING
Walter follows his prey down row after row of graves.

WALTER
Go ahead, buddy. Choose your spot.

Ned heads to an ISOLATED GRAVE, disappearing behind the
GRAVESTONE. Walter approaches. Takes a deep breath. Spins
around the grave, gun at the ready. Ned..,

...IS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN.

Walter, puzzled, looks about. He glances at the grave. It
belongs to a "LAURA TOLLINS."

The WIND picks up. Leaves BLOW across the ground. In the
distance, against the SETTING SUN, he sees the SILHOUETTE OF
A MAN. Watching him.

EXT. MARKET SQUARE - NIGHT

Walter enters, BANDAGING HIS ARM. He looks once to his left,
once to his right, then left again, searching for Agatha. He
9.

sees a secondhand bookstore, "A NOVEL FATE." Walks up. Peers

in the window.

WALTER (V.0.)
What if. The only thing I know for
sure is, I_was late. That's all it
took.

Agatha is inside. She's reading a BOOK.
INT. "A NOVEL FATE" USED BOOKSTORE - NIGHT
Walter rants to Agatha.

WALTER

...the fucker was called "Ned." Ned
for chrissakes! Know why someone
calls a ninety-five pound pit bull
Ned? Nasty Evil Dog, that's why.
Well, next time I see it it's gonna
be Nedd --

(pronounces second D)
-- Nasty Evil Dead Dog. I'm telling
ya, that mangy little sucker has ‘horse
feed' written all over it and that's
nothing compared to what I'll do if I
ever meet the cretin who--

Agatha puts her finger over his lips.

AGATHA
Shush. Take a deep breath. It's your
birthday, remember?

WALTER
I've been thinking about that. How
come we go to see your friends on my
birthday?

AGATHA
Because you don’t have any.

Walter tries, but can't really argue with that.

WALTER
So: older, bitten, spending an evening
in hell...
(points to her book)
...I suppose I'm buying that for
you, too?

AGATHA
I think you might be, yes.

He takes it from her. The tattered cover reads:
io.

"THE NUMBER 23"
A NOVEL OF OBSESSION BY
TOPSY KRETTS

WALTER
Hardly the most imaginative of titles.
What is it, part of a series?

AGATHA

It's good. You should try it.
WALTER

Books--
AGATHA

--are for people with no imagination
of their own. I know. You don't know
what you're missing.

WALTER
And yet, life goes on.

EXT, RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT

Walter and Agatha walk along, hand in hand. (STILL IMAGES
MAY ACCOMPANY THE FOLLOWING DIALOGUE)

WALTER (V.0.)
February 3rd. That makes me Aquarius,
one of the most innovative signs of
the zodiac, a collective characterized
by an acrobatic mind, a visionary,
occasionally rebellious nature, a
genius bordering on insanity, able
to meet any challenge. Remember Thomas
Edison? Charles Darwin? Rasputin?
Jules Verne? That isn't all. Experts
say Aquarians are philanthropists.
Love is their driving force. Friends
are vitally important.

They reach a house with BALLOONS tied to the front gate, all
painted to look like variations of Walter. Walter scowls.

WALTER {V.O.)
I, am living proof of the fallacy of
astrology.
Agatha drags him through the gate.
INT. HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - NIGHT
ISAAC FRENCH, dashing in a tuxedo, opens the door. Watch

carefully and you'll notice he pays a little too much
attention to Agatha.
11.

AGATHA
Sorry we're late, Isaac.

ISAAC
Nothing a kiss won't cure.

He offers his cheek to her. She kisses him.

ISAAC
How's the arm, birthday boy?

WALTER
Just waiting for it to drop off.

ISAAC
Good job it didn't bite you somewhere
else then, eh?

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Evidence of several PARTY GAMES having been played (pin the
tail on the donkey, indoor hoopla, etc) is visible.

Agatha plus twenty of her BOOKISH FRIENDS, all wearing PARTY
HATS, pay close attention to Isaac -- acting the total host
and just finishing explaining the next game to them.

A SKELETON sits in the corner. It also wears a party hat.

ISAAC
Does anyone have any questions? How
about you, Walter?

walter sits in an armchair picking at the remaining crumbs
of his birthday cake, a pile of weird and wonderful GIFTS
beside him.

WALTER
You're going to hand out those little
cards you're holding, all of which
are blank except for one saying
‘Murderer’ and another saying
‘Detective.' Then you're going to
turn out the lights and we all roam
about the house in the dark trying
not to break anything, and not owning
up if we do, until the person with
the 'Murderer' card ‘kills’ one of
us. The victim should then move away
from the killer before waking the
neighbors with an ear-splitting
scream, at which point the lights
will come on and, assuming the police
don't arrive, we all start guessing
who the killer is.
12.

ISAAC
Sounds like someone has played before.

He hands out the cards.

ISAAC
Everyone ready?

People nod. Isaac walks to a FUSEBOX in the HALLWAY.

All the lights go out and suddenly we are playing...
..-MURDER IN THE DARK!

We see VARIOUS SHOTS of SHADOWS roaming through the house,
accompanied by the usual GIGGLES/APOLOGIES/GASPS as people
bump into each other.

AGATHA

slips inside a BEDROOM and safely watches the goings-on
through a crack in the door. Suddenly we hear:

A WHISPER
I don't think hiding out in the
bedroom is quite in the spirit of
the game.

Agatha turns around, whispers back:

AGATHA
who's that?

A WHISPER
Who do you want it to be?

Agatha's hands fumble over someone's face.

AGATHA
Walter?

The whisper and face do indeed belong to Walter.

AGATHA
Oh God, I'm sorry. I had no idea he
was planning a games night. What are
you doing in here, anyway?

WALTER
Oh, you know, I thought I'd sneak
into a bedroom and see if I got lucky.

AGATHA
And did you?
13.

WALTER
I certainly did.

He starts to kiss her face.

AGATHA
Who do you think the killer is?

WALTER
Do you care?

He kisses her again. This time she responds. The kiss quickly
grows in intensity

Walter runs his hands over Agatha's body, working his way
over her breasts to her neck, continuing on up to her ears
before descending back down to her neck. Then, very slowly,
Walter starts to squeeze...

AGATHA
Mmm... Walter Sparrow...

It's soft and sensual and utterly sexy. Or at least, that's
how it starts out. But Walter's grip gets tighter and tighter.
Agatha's eyes open. She tries to scream but his mouth is
pressed to hers.

Walter’s eyes snap open... which is when Agatha realizes...
EXT. THE SPARROW HOME - NIGHT

Walter and Agatha walk to the front door, arm in arm. Walter
opens the door, is about to step inside when...

IN THE LIVING ROOM - ROBIN'S HEAD
pops up from the couch. A GIRL'S HEAD follows it up.
WALTER
(to Agatha)
Remember the days we used to go for
late night walks in the moonlight?

AGATHA
There's no moon tonight.

She moves to the door. Walter takes her hands.

WALTER
We can take advantage of the darkness.

AGATHA
Someone already did.
14.

She again tries to reach the door. Walter prevents her. He
nods to a HAMMOCK on the verandah and winks.

WALTER
Remember those days, too?

AGATHA
Walter, it's freezing out here. What's
gotten into you tonight?

WALTER
I just thought, seeing as it is my
birthday, and we've just spent the
evening--

AGATHA
--I'll get a blanket.

WALTER
No! I mean, there's one in the truck.

AGATHA
You're giving me a dog blanket?

WALTER
Take my coat.

AGATHA
You'll freeze to death.

WALTER
Not if someone keeps me warm.

Agatha smiles. Walter wraps his coat around her and they sit.

AGATHA
I can't believe you killed me.

WALTER
It was fun. The look on your face...

AGATHA
At least you got some interesting
gifts. Those commemorative silver
dollars from Fred, for example--

WALTER
--I don’t need a hobby, Aggie. I
have you.
Agatha snuggles up to him.

AGATHA
How's it feel?
15.

WALTER
To be a cold-blooded killer?
(looks around)
Strangely familiar.

AGATHA
I meant, to be another year older.
WALTER
Oh, Devastating.
AGATHA
Really?
WALTER
But it's--

(imitating Isaac)
--nothing a kiss won't cure.

He offers his cheek to Agatha. She digs him in the ribs then
kisses him. The front door opens. Robin pokes his head out.
He's in his pajamas and robe.

ROBIN
Mom? Dad? I thought I heard voices.

AGATHA
If someone was in bed asleep like
they were meant to be, they wouldn't
have heard anything.
She approaches him.

AGATHA
How's that homework looking?

ROBIN
Like it's finished.

Agatha strokes his face affectionately.

AGATHA
Don't be long. I'll make cocoa.

She goes inside.
Walter and Robin exchange looks.
WALTER
Well, don't just stand there. You'll
catch yourself a death.

He holds open his coat, beckoning his son to cuddle up with
him. Robin does, gladly.
ié.

ROBIN

We fell asleep. That's all.
WALTER

Back door?
ROBIN

She went down the alley.
He hands Walter a PRESENT from his robe pocket.

ROBIN
I forgot to give you this.

WALTER
I accept bribes at any time of day.

Father and son smile.

Walter opens the present: a hand-painted "FATHER OF THE YEAR"
mug.

WALTER
She's a nice girl, Robin. Make sure
she stays that way.

He squeezes Robin's hand, then leads him inside.

INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Agatha pours hot milk into three mugs. Walter and Robin enter.
Walter transfers his cocoa into his new FOTY mug. The Sparrows
all smile and head off to bed, Walter turning out the light

as they go.

Seconds later, the moon emerges from a cloud.

Agatha's book, "The Number 23," lies on the table, glinting
in the moonlight.

INT. ACO OFFICE - MORNING

Fresh-faced DR. ALICE MORTIMER, 26, checks a file. A mug
serves as a pencil-holder. It's almost empty.

SUPER UP: FEBRUARY 4

DR. ALICE MORTIMER
This is your first bite?

WALTER
First animal one, yes.
(off her look)
My wife. She has these... gnawing
urges. In her sleep.
17.

DR. ALICE MORTIMER
Tell me about Ned. What would you do
iff you came across him again?

WALTER
Put my foot on the gas and accelerate.

DR. ALICE MORTIMER
You'd run away from him?

WALTER
No, I'd crush the furry fleabag
beneath my tires.
{off her look)
I'm joking. This whole thing's a joke.

DR. ALICE MORTIMER
Mr. Sparrow, animal control
regulations state that any officer
suffering at the hands of an animal
must undergo psychological counseling
to evaluate their state of mind.

WALTER
You don't seriously think I'm going
to snap because some crafty little
canine chowed down on my arm?

DR. ALICE MORTIMER
This is your first bite. A person's
first bite can have traumatic
consequences.

WALTER
Traumatic consequences? I'm not
traumatized. A little embarrassed,
perhaps.

He rolls up his sleeve.

WALTER

This is not trauma. This is stupidity.
I gave him my arm on a platter. Can't
blame a species of lower intelligence
for that. That'd be like shouting
from the rooftops after the time I

let my wife choose the color for the
living room walls. Not that women

are a species of lower intelligence.

Dr. Mortimer writes in her file. Walter tries to see what.

DR. ALICE MORTIMER
Have a good day, Mr. Sparrow.
18,

WALTER
What? No. Agatha’s the most
intelligent woman I know. What she
sees in me I'm not sure. I love my
job. And I'm good at it.

DR. ALICE MORTIMER
Ned got away.

WALTER
Well, yes. But--

DR. ALICE MORTIMER
--don't worry, apart from a flawed
sense of humor I've given you a clean
bill of health. You're not a danger
to anyone. That's why you can go.

WALTER
It is?
He relaxes, glances at the clock -- just gone 10 a.m.
WALTER

But they've given me the whole day
off for this.

DR. ALICE MORTIMER
Then make the most of it. I won't
tell.
Walter walks to the door.
DR, ALICE MORTIMER
Mr. Sparrow? What color did she
choose? For the walls.
INT. LIVING ROOM - MORNING

WALTER (V.O.)
Red. Blood red.

Walter stands in the doorway gazing at the BLOOD RED WALLS.

He half-heartedly rummages through various BIRTHDAY GIFTS:
jigsaw, beer-making kit, cardigan, new deck of cards, etc.

WALTER
Agatha, Agatha, Agatha.

INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

Walter munches off a plate of COOKIES as he pours a glass of
MILK. He pauses. Transfers it into his FOTY mug.
19.
INT. BEDROOM - MORNING

His 'n' hers bedside tables -- Agatha's cluttered, Walter's
having alarm clock and lamp only.

Walter lies on the bed. Bored.
INT. ROBIN'S BEDROOM - MORNING
Walter lies on Robin's bed.

He gets up. Looks around the room. Passes a MODEL OF A HELIX
made out of empty matchboxes. He picks up the top box. The
helix collapses. Walter, sheepish, leaves the room.

INT. AGATHA'S LIBRARY - MORNING
Wall to wall BOOKS, plus a DESK and OLD TYPEWRITER.

Walter stands in the doorway. He steps in, then thinks better
of it. Turning to leave, he sees "THE NUMBER 23" on the desk.
He picks it up. Stares at the cover. Turns to the BLURBS on
the back:

WALTER
"A heart-wrenching odyssey into
paranoia," "One of the most horrifying
metamorphoses ever told." "Beware
the dog next door."
(a beat)
Beware the dog next door?

INT, BEDROOM - MORNING

Walter settles on the bed with the book. He turns to AN OLD,
BATTERED DOLL on Agatha's bedside table.

WALTER
Don't you tell her about this.

He turns to page one. Clears his throat. Reads aloud:

WALTER
"You can call me Fingerling. It's
not my real name, but comes from a
book I read as a child, 'Fingerling
at the Zoo.' Paper flap long gone,
it had a green, hardback cover and
mottled texture, and was possibly my
very first book. Funny, I can't recall
what it was about, the only thing I
remember is the name. ‘Fingerling.'
I wished it was mine. Now it is."

He frowns. Flicks to the front and finds the disclaimer:
20.

WALTER
"All the characters in this book are
fictitious, and anyone finding a
resemblance to actual persons, living
or dead, should proceed no further."

INT. AGATHA'S LIBRARY ~ MORNING

Walter pulls books off the shelves. Checks their DISCLAIMERS.

WALTER
All the characters... any
resemblance... entirely coincidental.

(different books)
Purely coincidental. Wholly
coincidental .

INT. BEDROOM - MORNING
Walter stares at "The Number 23" disclaimer. He continues:

WALTER
"Do not concern yourself with my nom
de plume. My real name matters not,
nor my physical description. Imagine
me, if you must, as someone you once
knew. Someone, perhaps, you liked."

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. CLASSROOM - DAY
An URBAN SCHOOL. TOWER BLOCKS are visible out the windows.

WALTER (V.O.)
"As a kid I was top of my class."

Young FINGERLING raises his hand to a question. He has a
somewhat sallow complexion.

WALTER (V.0O.)
"Not because I liked studying, but
because I realized an education was
my best shot at getting out of town.
See, the stork dropped me in a small
dustbowl of a town."

The view out the window CHANGES ACCORDINGLY. Buildings
disa tall elm trees sprouting in their pi The sk

ppear p. g place. y
turns biue and is fu °. rdsong. The room interior aiters

too, as do the kids, the teacher.
EXT. COUNTRY ROAD -~ AFTERNOON

Fingerling walks along, laughing gaily with pals.
21.

WALTER (V.O.)
"There wasn't anything wrong with
it. As far as boring towns go I'm
sure it ranked above average. It was
just boring. So were the other kids."

His pals VANISH. He walks alone, kicking a soda can.

WALTER (V.0.)
"They're probably all still there."

He passes the TOWN CEMETERY.

WALTER (V.O.)
"No one ever left. But I was destined
for other things."

INT. BEDROOM - DAY

Walter's face pales.

INT. FINGERLING'S FATHER'S OFFICE - DAY
Fingerling does his homework.

WALTER (V.O.)
"Much as I loved him, I wasn't gonna
end up like my dad. It was bad enough
people said I looked like him."

He looks up. His FATHER sits behind a desk, maniacally tapping
away at a calculator.

WALTER (V.O.)
"He was an accountant and fully
expected me to take over the business
he had built. Still, he loved me."

His Father motions for Fingerling to continue his homework.

WALTER (V.O.)
"In his own special way."

INT. BEDROOM - DAY

Walter lowers the book. Even he doesn't know exactly what
he's feeling. He reads on:

WALTER
"My father's inability to express
warmth was more than compensated by
my mom. In her eyes I could do no
wrong.”
22.
INT. KITCHEN - EVENING
Fingerling sits at the table, still doing homework.
WALTER (V.O.)}
"I wanted to be like her. She
understood what made people tick.”
His MOTHER {her kitchen clearly portraying her as someone
fond of baking) slides a plate of COOKIES and a glass of
MILK in front of him. She closes his books and strokes his
head, tenderly.
INT. BEDROOM - DAY
Walter glances at his milk and cookies.
WALTER
If you become a dogcatcher, I am
gonna sue your ass.
He continues, quietly for a few seconds, until:
WALTER
"My mom was thrilled when, on my
eighteenth birthday, I announced that
I wanted to be a..."
ENT. KITCHEN - MORNING

Breakfast-time, PRESENTS (books on finance, etc) cover the
table in front of Fingerling, 18 today.

Fingerling's Mother's mouth hangs open. She's thrilled.
INT. BEDROOM - DAY
Walter looks up from the book.
WALTER
Detective. He wants to be a detective.
(to Agatha's doll)
You hear that? A detective!

Visibly relaxed, he continues reading, but as he does, his
voice grows heavy...

WALTER (V.O.)
"Not so my father.”

INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

At the other end of the table sits Fingerling's Father. He's
seething.
23.

WALTER (V.O.}
It made his hatred of our neighbor,
old Mrs. Dobkins, even stronger, and
she'd been dead ten years. She lived
next door and our houses were identical,
except for..."

INT. BEDROOM - DAY
Walter freezes. His face drains of color.

WALTER (V.O.)
".,,the gardens. You see, her house
fell on the bend, and thus, her back
garden was twice the size. But it wasn't
that that angered my dad. Oh no..."

EXT. BACK GARDEN - DAY

A tidy place, the only fault being the FENCE running down
one side. Unlike the one that takes over at the bottom and
comes up the other side, this one is OLD AND RICKETY.

WALTER (V.O.)
"...Picture if you can..."

We creep towards it, peek through a KNOT HOLE, travel into:

WALTER (V.O.)
“,..a world where the grass is forever
thigh-high, A world where wild animals
could feel at home, their only hazard
being Alfie, Mrs. Dobkins' cocker
spaniel."

ALFIE appears, following a scent.
WALTER (V.0O.)
"I always knew when Alfie was up to
something. How? Simple.”

Alfie comes across a rabbit. The chase is on. A SAXOPHONE
tune fades in.

INT. FINGERLING'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Young Fingerling stops playing the SAXOPHONE and looks out
of his window, which looks out over:

WALTER (V.0O.)
"Swaying grass. It was as if a tornado
was signing its name in it.”
24.

INT. BEDROOM - DAY
Walter turns the page swiftly.

WALTER
"Dad was incapable of seeing the
beauty. He also didn't think it funny
when Alfie sought a little R and R
in our garden,”

EXT. BACK GARDEN - DAY
Alfie sunbathes on the lawn. Suddenly, he's on red alert.

WALTER (V.0O.)
"It was my job to catch him."

Fingerling pounces on him, Alfie darts off, scampering this
way and that.

WALTER (V.O.)
"From this, a detective in the making
was born. Let me explain."

INT. BEDROOM - DAY

Walter closes the book and searches through wardrobes. A_dog
YAPS incessantly.

WALTER (V.O.)
"It was my eighth birthday and Alfie's
gift sounded like exercise. Except
it wasn't. He just stood still and
barked."

INT. THE SPARROW HOME - VARIOUS ROOMS - DAY
Walter searches cupboards, under beds, etc.
WALTER (V.O.)
"There was no answer when I rang
Mrs. Dobkins' doorbell so I went
through the side gate."
EXT, MRS. DOBKINS' HOUSE - DAY
Fingerling passes through the side gate, Alfie in arms.
INT. MRS. DOBKINS' HOUSE - MORNING
He enters the KITCHEN, checks VARIOUS ROOMS -- all empty.
WALTER (V.O.)

"Soon I was going upstairs. At the
top, Alfie leaped from my arms."
25,

Alfie runs into a room. Fingerling follows. It's MRS. DOBKINS'
BEDROOM and Alfie is on the bed, licking Mrs. Dobkins' face.

She's been dead a good fourteen hours.
INT. HALLWAY - DAY
Walter spies the HATCH to the LOFT.
WALTER (V.0O.)
"It was an hour before the doctor
arrived, and in that uncertain hour
my eight-year-old mind raced."
INT. LOFT - DAY
Walter climbs into BOX HEAVEN. Starts moving stuff.

WALTER (V.O.)
"I decided Mrs. Dobkins had been
killed by a man with a deranged mind,
a mind such as our town had never
seen before. No one would be safe
from him, not even his loved ones.
Especially his loved ones."

He pauses in the shadows, nervous.
WALTER (V.0.)

"Of course, the doctor later concluded
it was a heart attack but by then my
mind had been opened to a whole new
existence."

He reaches out and opens an OLD CHEST.

EXT. THE SPARROW HOME - LATE AFTERNOON

Agatha arrives home. She sees Walter's truck.

INT. THE SPARROW HOME - LATE AFTERNOON

Agatha pops her head into the LIVING ROOM.

AGATHA
Yoo-hoo,.

She heads UPSTAIRS, notices a SCUFF MARK on the wall halfway
up. Navigating the LOFT STEPS (down) she enters their BEDROOM.
Several wardrobes are open. She returns to the loft steps.

AGATHA
Walter?

She climbs up. The LOFT is empty.
26.
She checks the TOILET, the BATHROOM, even her LIBRARY.

Next comes ROBIN'S BEDROOM. Empty. She picks one of Robin's
shirts off the floor then notices the helix.

AGATHA
Walter.

The window draws her gaze -- a LIGHT is on in the GARAGE.
EXT. YARD - LATE AFTERNOON

Agatha approaches the garage. She opens the door.

INT. GARAGE - LATE AFTERNOON

Walter sits on the floor, his back to her. The chest serves
as a backrest and is empty, its contents (OLD PHOTO ALBUMS,
TROPHIES, CHILDHOOD MEMORABILIA) spread around him.

AGATHA
Here you are. What are you doing?

WALTER
I'll clear it up later.

Agatha walks over, freezes on seeing the book in his hands.

AGATHA
Oh. My. God. I don't believe my eyes.

WALTER
Did you read this?

He folds a page corner and closes it. It's "The Number 23."
Agatha nods.

WALTER
What did you think of it?
AGATHA
I thought it was brilliant. Style's
a bit odd. It reads a bit... raw.
WALTER

This Fingerling guy--

AGATHA
Fabulous name.

WALTER
Yeah. What did you make of him?
27.

AGATHA
Oh, I loved him. At least, I did in
the beginning.

WALTER

What do you mean, "in the beginning"?
AGATHA

Well, he... How far are you?
WALTER

Page eighteen.

AGATHA
Oh. Haven't been reading long, then?

WALTER
It feels like I have.

AGATHA
Darling, this is wonderful. Good for
you. I'll fix your favorite for dinner
tonight.
She leaves. Walter follows after her.
INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Agatha enters through the BACK DOOR and washes her hands.
Walter stops in the doorway.

Agatha transfers ingredients from the fridge to the table --
ONIONS, TOMATOES, MINCE, etc.

AGATHA
Honey, you're letting in a draught.

Walter puts the items back in the fridge.

AGATHA
Walter! I just got that out.

He walks outside then reappears with a stack of PHOTO ALBUMS,
etc, and dumps it on the table. He holds up "THE NUMBER 23."

WALTER
It's me, Ag. Me.

AGATHA
What are you talking about?

Walter points to PHOTOS of him growing up, his parents, their
house, their car, shots of him in the garden, an OLD, RICKETY

FENCE in the background.
28.

Another is of Walter and a COCKER SPANIEL. Then the view

from a bedroom -- a sprawling jungle of a xrden next door.
WALTER
Some little twerp has written a book
about me.

Agatha can't help it -- she laughs.

AGATHA
Sorry. What do you mean?

WALTER
I mean, somebody has taken MY life,
MY childhood, MY memories, and based
a character on it. Fingerling.

AGATHA
Don't be ridiculous. Fingerling's
nothing like you.

WALTER
He's everything like me. His past is
my past. They've stolen it. This Kretts
person has... he's plagiarized my life.

He hands her ANOTHER BOOK. Paper flap long gone, it has a
green, hardback cover and mottled texture. Its title is:

AGATHA
"“Fingerling at the Zoo."

WALTER
My mother read it to me when I was
young.

AGATHA
Honey, lots of people would have
read this as a kid.

WALTER
Did you?

AGATHA
No, but...

She points to various photos.

AGATHA
There are many towns like your
hometown, each with streets like
yours. With houses like yours.

WALTER
And dogs next door?
29,

AGATHA
Your neighbor had a dog? Shocking.

WALTER
It wasn't called Alfie. It was called
Chief. "Mischief" my dad called it.
It used to escape all the time. That's
why I became who I am. A dogcatcher.

AGATHA
Fingerling's a detective.

WALTER
So he used a little imagination.
It's like he's implying I'm not good
enough!

AGATHA
I finally understand why you don't
like to read.
WALTER
You remember the old woman next door?
Well she died. On MY eighth birthday.
He sinks into a chair -- mentally exhausted.
AGATHA
So there are similarities. Read on.
You'll soon realize Fingerling's
very different from you. I promise.
She puts the book in his hands. Walter stares at it, the
words "THE NUMBER 23, A NOVEL OF OBSESSION BY TOPSY KRETTS"
staring right back at him.
INT. HALLWAY - LATE AFTERNOON

Robin enters, playing with a Rubick's cube. He hangs up his
schoolbag and makes his way to the kitchen.

ROBIN
I'm home. I'm hungry. I'm--

He pauses. Backtracks.
INT. LIVING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

Walter reads in an armchair. He doesn't notice Robin staring
at him from the doorway.

INT, KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON

Robin enters. Agatha is cooking.
30,

AGATHA
Oh hi, sweetie. How was school--
What's happened? You're very pale.

ROBIN
Dad's reading.

AGATHA
Yes, I know! Wonderful, isn't it?
Bit of a shock, admittedly.

ROBIN
But... how... why... when... I didn't
even know he could read. Well, of
course I knew he could, I just...
what's he reading?

AGATHA
His life-story.

ROBIN
Huh?

He picks at some food scraps. Agatha smacks his hand with a
spoon and he goes to the sink to wash his hands.

AGATHA
Dinner might be rather odd tonight.

ROBIN
Why? What are we having?

AGATHA
Robin, darling, I love you deeply,
but humor is not your strong point.
She pushes the door shut, quietly.
INT. LIVING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

Robin sits opposite his dad, watching. Walter ignores him.
He moves to Walter's armrest. Reads along.

ROBIN
What kind of name is 'Fingerling?’

Walter shuts the book. Robin, a little hurt, leaves the room.
EXT. THE SPARROW HOME - EVENING

The moon is waning.
31.
INT. KITCHEN - EVENING
Dinner-time for the Sparrows. Spaghetti bolognaise. They

serve themselves, awkward, fleeting smiles the currency of
conversation,

ROBIN
Why would someone write a book about
you?

WALTER

That, son, is a very good question.
ROBIN
Am I in it? I mean, if it is about
dad, shouldn't I have a starring role?
AGATHA
Yes, you should. And yet, you don't.
I wonder what that means?
WALTER
The author knew you'd be a scene-
stealer.
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
The CLOCK clicks to 8 p.m. It begins to CHIME.

Walter reads in his armchair. Agatha reads in her armchair.
Robin does homework on the sofa.

DISSOLVE TO:
1i P.M.
as the clock FINISHES CHIMING.

AGATHA
Robin.

Robin sighs and rises. He kisses each as he says:

ROBIN
Night, Mom. Night, Dad.

Walter doesn't respond. Robin exits.

AGATHA
I think I'm going to run a bath.

Walter -- still totally oblivious.
32.
INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT
Agatha soaks in the tub. Thinking.
INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
She enters, post-bath and in her nightgown. The bed is empty.
INT. STAIRCASE - NIGHT
She peers over the banisters -- Walter is still reading.
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Agatha takes the book from Walter, folds down a page corner,
and pulls him up. .

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

Agatha pulls back the covers for a pajama-clad Walter and he
gets into bed. She goes to kiss him. He shies away.

AGATHA
How far are you?

WALTER
He's just spent his first month's
wages on a diamond ring for Fabrizia.

AGATHA
Ah yes, his Italian girlfriend. And
you told me I was the first girl you
ever loved.

WALTER
She could be you.
(off her look)
Am I being silly?

AGATHA

Every time I read a book it's like
the author managed to steal a part
of me I thought only I knew about.
I'll write my own one day and do the
same to someone else. No, you're not
being silly. Paranoid, yes.

(she snuggles up)
But I love you all the same.

Walter kisses her forehead.

WALTER
I love you, too.

He clicks off the light.
33.
INT. KITCHEN - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

The light comes on. Walter walks to the sink and turns on
the cold water tap. Holds his hand underneath.

The coolness of the water wakes him. He looks around,
confused. He's been sleepwalking.

He's drawn back to the white, porcelain sink. It's spattered
with red. He looks at his hands. More red. It's BLOOD.

He checks himself, concerned. Then he sees it -~ an EMPTY
SLOT in Agatha's KNIFE BLOCK.

INT. STAIRCASE - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

Walter walks up, one step at a time...

INT. BEDROOM - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

He clicks on the light. Agatha is snuggled under the covers.
He peels back the covers: BLOODSTAINED SHEETS appear.

He throws off the covers. Freezes.

AGATHA

has been stabbed to death, multiple times. The KNIFE still
protrudes from her body.

WALTER
No.

He pulls out the knife. Stares at it. Throws it aside and
collapses over Agatha, sobbing. Pulls her into his arms.

WALTER
A nightmare. Nothing but a nightmare.
Put her back, close your eyes, and
it'll be alright. Everything will be
all right.

He lays Agatha down tenderly and shuts his eyes.

WALTER
Please.

He opens them. Agatha is still dead. Tears stream down his
cheeks. He SCREAMS.

AGATHA (0.S.}
Sorry! I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
34.

The light comes on. Agatha stares at Walter. He's clutching
his ghoulder. She moves his hand away.

AGATHA
Oh God, I almost drew blood.

Walter follows her gaze. Teeth marks puncture his skin. He
looks at his pajamas, the sheets, Agatha’'s nightgown -- no

knife, no blood anywhere.

Agatha kisses his shoulder. Walter takes her head in his
hands, gazes at her, and kisses her passionately.

INT. ACO OFFICE - MORNING
SUPER UP: FEBRUARY 5
Sybil works the dispatch, headset on.

SYBIL
What kind of noise?

A 'PUTT-PUTT-SCREECH' comes over the speakers.
EXT. STREET - MORNING

Walter's truck sits in the shade under a tree. A 'PUTT-PUTT-
SCREECH' comes from his open window.

INT. TRUCK - MORNING
Walter stops making the noise.

SYBIL'S VOICE
I'll call a mechanic.

WALTER
Already done. He's on his way.

SYBIL'S VOICE
Let me know the deal, ASAP.

WALTER
Will do. Unit 5 out.

He hangs up the receiver. Reassures himself:

WALTER
It's just one day.

He turns to "The Number 23" on the next seat. Picks it up.
35.
EXT. IN A TREE - MORNING - A BIRD'S POV
Locking down on Walter's truck.
INT. TRUCK - CONTINUED
Bird poop hits the windshield. Walter doesn't notice.
INT. 9TH FLOOR APARTMENT - DAY

Looking through a telescope (into the apartment opposite) at
a GORGEOUS GAL, pacing back and forth in her underwear.

Fingerling, now grown up and wearing POLICE UNIFORM, turns to
a somewhat sheepish, SLEAZY LITTLE MAN. The Man redirects the
telescope and Fingerling looks again, this time into an all-
white LIVING ROOM.
In the center is a CHAIR. Above it hangs a NOOSE.
SLEAZY LITTLE MAN (0.S.)
She gets on the chair, puts it around
her neck, and just stands there.
The Gal enters frame, does exactly this.
SLEAZY LITTLE MAN (0.S.)
Then she gets down. Been doing it
for two hours. She recently stopped
seeing some guy who was doing her.
EXT. STREET - DAY
Fingerling exits one apartment block and heads for the other.
INT. CORRIDOR - DAY
Fingerling knocks at Apartment #92- (the last number is
missing). No answer. He tries next door, #925, flashing his
badge at an old, Chinese woman.

PINGERLING
Police. Can I use your balcony?

Hard to tell if she understands. Fingerling enters anyway.
EXT. BALCONY - DAY

Fingerling climbs around the dividing wall and peeks round
the edge of the French doors. SUICIDE GAL, on the chair,
sees him and quickly puts the noose around her neck.

Fingerling steps into the open, hands up.
36.

FINGERLING
I'm not here to hurt you. I'm here
to help.

He opens the doors. The walls, ceiling, furniture --
everything is covered with PLAIN, WHITE PAPER. Letter-size.

Fingerling, spellbound, inches his way to the couch and sits.

FINGERLING
So. What's with the Hammermill mosaic?

SUICIDE GAL
I know what you're up to, this ‘try
to befriend me' crap. Come any closer
and I'il jump.

FINGERLING
I'd rather you didn't.

SUICIDE GAL
Why should you care?

FINGERLING
Today's my birthday. If you jump
it'll be my worst one ever.

SUICIDE GAL
You're pathetic. I swear, move and
I‘ll fucking jump.

FINGERLING
If you want to die, die, but hanging's
painful as hell. What's worse, most
people screw up making the noose.
All they achieve is a permanent
necklace, a grisly reminder of how
utterly pathetic they are. If you're
serious about ending it there are
far more effective ways.

SUICIDE GAL
(dumbfounded)
Such as?

FINGERLING
Well, you live on the ninth floor.
Haven't you ever wanted to fly?
Suicide Gal laughs. A beat. Fingerling offers her his hand.

FINGERLING
It really is my birthday.
37.
INT. TRUCK - DAY
The radio CRACKLES into life, startling Walter.

SYBIL’S VOICE
Unit 5, come in. Walter!

He thinks for a second then picks up the receiver.
WALTER
Sybil? Sorry I haven't got back to
you. We're running some tests...
diagnostic things.
SYBIL'S VOICE
And? Talk to me, Walter. The city's
canine population is running amok.
EXT. STREET - DAY

No mechanic anywhere.

WALTER
It doesn't look good. Something to
do with the... fan belt... timing

mechanism?

(to non-existent mechanic)
That's what you said, isn't it?

(to Sybil)
Yeah. He's getting some parts. I'll
let you know as soon as I'm mobile.

SYBIL'S VOICE
(testy)
Fine. HQ out.

Walter turns back to the book.

WALTER
"The woman warns me to be careful:
she was a together-person once."

INT. SUICIDE GAL'S KITCHEN - DAY

Suicide Gal makes coffee. The decor here matches the living
room, Even the coffee jar is wrapped in paper.

SUICIDE GAL
Now I'm a bad person. I don't want
to turn you bad. You seem nice.

WALTER {V.0.)
"I should have got out of there but
I'm real curious."
38.

INT. SUICIDE GAL'S LIVING ROOM - DAY
Fingerling and Suicide Gal sit on the couch with coffee.

WALTER (V.0O.)
“We play this cute waiting game."

Suicide Gal peels a sheet of paper off the couch.

Etched into the leather ARE LOTS OF WORDS, SEEMINGLY SCRAWLED
AT RANDOM, WITH NUMBERS ASSIGNED TO THEM...

... ALL ADDING UP TO 23.

WALTER {V.O.)
"Then she said it.”

SUICIDE GAL
This number... this FUCKING number...
it rules my world.

INT. TRUCK - DAY
The CB radio crackles into life, again startling Walter.

SYBIL'S VOICE
Unit 5, come in. Do you copy, Unit
5? Walter?

Walter ignores her, reads LOUDER to drown her out.

WALTER
"It's all my father's fault.”

INT. SUICIDE GAL'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

Suicide Gal stares at a MAN'S NAME on the wall: TIMOTHY CHARLES
HUNT accompanied by the numbers 110/66/63, 2/12/9, 23.

SUICIDE GAL
He said he was a genius and that
he'd figured out how to beat it. He
said I'd be safe. He said--

INT. 8-YR-OLD SUICIDE GAL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

A GIRL (Suicide Gal aged 8) sits in bed, knees pulled up
tight to her chest. Her FATHER sits on the edge of her bed.
His eyes are fraught with anguish. His shirt 1s BLOOD~STAINED.

GIRL'S FATHER
--Daddy loves you and he's going to
do something that guarantees his
little girl gets to grow up to be
just who she wants to be.
39.
INT. 8-YR-OLD SUICIDE GAL'S FATHER'S DEN - NIGHT
Her Father holds a GUN to his head, hand shaking.

SUICIDE GAL (V.O.)
All he had to do was kill himself
and the curse would have ended with
him.

He lowers the gun, unable to do it.

SUICIDE GAL (V.0O.)
I guess he just didn't love me enough.

INT. SUICIDE GAL’S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUED
Suicide Gal paces back and forth as she rants:

SUICIDE GAL
It's everywhere. Times. Dates. Numbers
of buses. License plates. Pages of
books. Even elevator floor lights.
Soon I realized it was in my name.
The words I spoke. Nothing was safe.
Nothing. My favorite color's pink.
You know what pink is?

She rips a piece of paper off the wall, Behind it are a mass
of words and their corresponding sums. She points to the
words RED and WHITE. Red = 27. White = 65. 27+65=92.

SUICIDE GAL
Pink has four letters.

92/4 equals...

SUICIDE GAL
Twenty-fucking-three.

WALTER (V.O.)
"I'll be honest -- I didn't get it.
I asked her the only question I could
muster."

FINGERLING
Any more coffee?

EXT. STREET - DAY
Walter's truck is EMPTY.
SYBIL'S VOICE
Walter, this isn't funny. Pick up. I

said, pick up, damn you. We have a
{MORE}
40.

SYBIL’S VOICE (CONT'D)
U.S.S. two blocks away so even if
your truck's still 0.0.S...

EXT, PARK - DAY
Walter reads as he walks.

WALTER
"Tt tell her a story.”
(a beat)
A story? The bastard tells stories?
(continues)
"I tell her the one about my Uncle
Charlie, how one day he read in his
stars he was gonna fall in love with
a woman wearing green so he walks
around all day until he finds one.
Six months later they married."
(not reading)
What kinda lame ass story is this?
{continues )
"The woman tells me..."

INT. SUICIDE GAL'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

SUICIDE GAL
..-you're lying.

Fingerling holds up a finger -- he hasn't finished yet.

FINGERLING
Two years later the woman in green
divorces my Uncle and takes half of
everything he's got.

Fingerling peers out the French doors -- still open.

FINGERLING
He's out there now, at this very
moment, still searching for a woman
in green. Figures he just got the
wrong one.

SUICIDE GAL
This is meant to make me feel better,
how?

FINGERLING
You look smarter than my Uncle Charlie.

Suicide Gal smiles.
41.
EXT. PARK - DAY
Walter sits on a bench.

WALTER (V.O.)
"She has a face meant to smile."

Walter smiles -- he'd have been proud of that story.
INT, SUICIDE GAL'S HALLWAY - DAY
Fingerling and Suicide Gal walk to the door. She opens it.

SUICIDE GAL
I promise I'll be okay. Thank you.

She kisses him on the cheek. Fingerling steps out. As he
walks down the corridor:

SUICIDE GAL
Officer? Happy birthday. How many is
it?

FINGERLING

Twenty... five.
Suicide Gal smiles again.
INT, ELEVATOR - DAY
Fingerling descends. Ali the floorlights are working.
WALTER (V.O.)
"I get in the elevator. I get out
the elevator."
EXT. APARTMENT BLOCK - STREET-LEVEL - DAY
WALTER (V.O.)
"IT exit the building. I wonder if
Sleazy is watching me and look up to
see when...”
Fingerling looks for Sleazy when... THUD!
SUICIDE GAL
hits the pavement beside him.
EXT. PARK - DAY - UNKNOWN POV...

...watching Walter from beside an OLD OAK TREE.
42.

WALTER (V.0.)
"That night I eat out with Fabrizia."

INT, RESTAURANT - EVENING

FABRIZIA wipes cream off Fingerling's chin. She's feeding
him strawberries.

FABRIZIA
Bi-zarre. But what does she mean, it
rules her world?

WALTER (V.O.)
"I'm not surprised in the slightest
when she announces..."

FABRIZIA
I wanna go see her place.

INT. SUICIDE GAL'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

All the paper has gone, revealing the full, terrifying extent

of Suicide Gal's obsession with 23.

 

FABRIZIA
This is so bi-zarre, To think it
happened on your 23rd birthday.
A beat.
INT. FINGERLING AND FABRIZIA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Silence. The only light comes from the open bathroom door.

WALTER (V.O.)
"At home, Fabrizia is buzzed."

Suddenly there's WATER MOVEMENT, a LOUD GASP FOR AIR, and:

FABRIZIA (O.S.)
Again.

WALTER (V.O.)
"God, I love her."

INT. UNKNOWN APARTMENT - DAY
WALTER (V.O.)
"The next day, I traced this ex- the
woman mentioned."

Fingerling enters a BEDROOM where a MAN lies in bed, DEAD.
A knife protrudes from his chest.
43.
EXT. PARK - DAY

Walter frowns -~ unsettled, yet not sure why. In the distance

you might notice NED beside THE QLD OAK TREE...
INT. POLICE STATION - THE SERGEANT'S OFFICE - DAY
Fingerling holds up an EVIDENCE BAG. Inside is the KNIFE.

FINGERLING
Forensics matched it to her.

His SERGEANT checks a report.
SERGEANT
Guess this is what she meant by being
a bad person.
FINGERLING
Yeah. If it's all right with you,
I'm gonna take the rest of the day
off. Feeling a bit queasy.

SERGEANT
Dead people will do that to ya.

EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY

Fingerling exits. He looks around, once to his left, once to
his right, then again to his left.

WALTER (V.O.)
"I didn't feel bad about lying. There
was just something I had to do."
EXT. PARK - DAY
Look closely and the hairs on Walter's nape are prickling.

WALTER (V.O.)
"EZ mean, it was only one day."

His mouth falls open with a bad case of déja vu. He stares
into space... until the book slowly draws him back.

INT, SUICIDE GAL‘'S LIVING ROOM

Fingerling studies the CRAZY WRITING on the walls. Around the
top of the walls is the ALPHABET plus EACH LETTER'S NUMBER.

WALTER (V.O.)
"You might laugh at what I did next,
but I bet you'll try it."

Fingerling pulls out his NOTEPAD, Starts scribbling.
44.
INT. ELEVATOR - DAY
Only floorlights 1, 5, 8 and 9 work.
As Fingerling descends, he stares at the notepad. On it are
a bunch of letters and numbers. Inside a circle at the

WALTER (V.O.)}

"Surely it was just a coincidence? I

mean, a name's just a name, right?"
...is the number 23.
INT. CAR - EVENING

Fingerling waits outside an office. The clock reads 7:30 p.m.

FINGERLING
30 minus 7 is 23.

Fabrizia raps on the window.
INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Fabrizia eats, Fingerling doesn't.

FABRIZIA
Are you okay?

FINGERLING
Yeah, Fine.

WALTER (V.O.)

"T don't tell her that, including

us, but excluding the waiters, there
are twenty-three people in the
restaurant. I do tell her about the
crazy woman's boyfriend. Her reaction
is..."

INT, CHEAP HOTEL - NIGHT
Fabrizia pays for a room.

WALTER (V.O.)
"...pure Fabrizia.”

INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Fabrizia unlocks a door. Fingerling stares at the room number.
45.
INT. HOTEL ROOM #23 - NIGHT

Fabrizia pulls a packet of STOCKINGS from her purse. She
throws them at Fingerling and lies on the bed, putting her
wrists against the headboard.

FABRIZIA
Don't worry, they're cheap ones.

Fingerling TIES EACH WRIST to a bedpost, starts unbuttoning
her blouse.

FABRIZIA
No. Rip it off. Rip it all off.

EXT. PARK - DAY

Walter shifts in his seat, somewhat uncomfortable. He looks
around, checking no one is watching him. Reads on, quietly.

WALTER
"I do as I'm told, She spreads her
legs and instructs me to look in her
purse, I find another packet of
stockings. I tie her legs. Then I
remove my clothes and climb aboard."

INT, HOTEL ROOM #23 - NIGHT
Fingerling makes love to Fabrizia. Gentle.

FABRIZIA
Pretend you have a knife in your
hands.

A beat. Fingerling squeezes his right hand into a fist and
traces it over her body at a steady height of six inches.
Fabrizia squirms beneath him -- almost like he does have a
knife. Fingerling gets more and more into it and when Fabrizia
goes to say something, he clamps his left hand over her mouth.

FINGERLING
Quiet, bitch, or you die!

INT. CAR - NIGHT
Fingerling and Fabrizia head home.
WALTER (V.O.)
"Of course, I would never really
harm Fabrizia. I loved her. And she
loved me.”

Fingerling looks at Fabrizia. She gazes lovingly at her new,
DIAMOND ENGAGEMENT RING.
46.
WALTER (V.O.)

"But that night I had the most

unsettling nightmare imaginable.”
EXT, PARK - DAY
Walter reads on, then lowers the book, his mind racing...
EXT. THE SPARROW HOME - DAY
Walter pulls into the driveway.
INT. GARAGE - DAY
Walter has covered one wall with paper. The alphabet is
written at the tep. Below it, the numbers 1 to 26. He writes
'WALTER SPARROW’ up. Proceeds as follows:
W=23

WALTER
Oh fuck.

He continues.
A=1; L=12; T=20; E=5; R=18. Total: 79.
S=19; P=16; A=1; R=18(x2); O=15; W=23. Total: 110.

Walter stares at it. Then he writes: 7+9=16 and 1+1+0=2 which
gives him 16+2=18. He sighs. Suddenly, he pauses.

He scribbles 'PAUL' between Walter and Sparrow.
P=16; A=1; U=21; L=12. Total: 50. 5+0=5.

WALTER
16 plus 2 plus 5 equais...

He turns. Stares at "The Number 23" lying on a work bench.
INT. "A NOVEL FATE” USED BOOKSTORE ~ AFTERNOON

The book is on the counter. Walter waits as a SALESPERSON
types into a computer. She frowns, swivels the monitor to
him, "NOT FOUND" flashes on screen.

SALESPERSON
Are you sure you bought it here?

WALTER
Of course I'm sure. What kind of
idiot mistakes where he buys a book?
(MORE)
47.

WALTER (CONT'D)
(a beat}
It was here. I bought it on my
birthday for my wife.

SALESPERSON
Shouldn't she be buying you stuff if
it was your birthday?

WALTER
There was this dog. I was late and...
Can you help me or not?

The Salesperson examines the book.

. SALESPERSON
It's self-published, self-printed
and by an author I've never heard
of.

She types "KRETTS, T" into the computer.

SALESPERSON
And old Topsy hasn't written a thing
since.

She hands the book back. Walter doesn't take it.

WALTER
That's all you can tell me? Dead
end, dead end, dead end?

SALESPERSON
Am I correct in thinking you want to
get in touch with the author?

WALTER
You are very correct.
SALESPERSON
Then may I be so... original... as

to point this out?
She points to a MAILBOX ADDRESS inside the back cover.
INT. THE SPARROW HOME - LATE AFTERNOON

Walter hits redial on the PHONE by the FRONT DOOR, a PHONE
BOOK by his feet. Agatha comes home.
AGATHA
So this is where you are. Sybil's
called me at least a dozen times.

He shushes her, speaks into the phone in a very odd voice.
48.

WALTER
Hello, I wonder if you can help me?

TELEPHONE VOICE
Mister, you call once more and I'm
calling the cops.

Dial-tone.

AGATHA
Why are you speaking in a funny voice?

Walter holds up "The Number 23."

WALTER
I'm trying to contact the bastard
thing's author but the only clue is
this.
{opens to mailbox address)
And the minimum wage little shit who
works there won't tell me anything!

AGATHA
Walter, what is going on?

INT. GARAGE - LATE AFTERNOON

Walter leads Agatha in. Scribbles and their corresponding

tallies covers the wall.

AGATHA
Oh my.

Walter points out VARIOUS DISCOVERIES.

WALTER
My name equals 23. My birthday is
two three. My driver's license. Social
security number. Everything!

He holds up "The Number 23."

WALTER
Don't tell me it isn't me. This proves
it. I'm telling you, the little fucker
used me.

AGATHA
Walter.

WALTER
He has, Aggie. Not only that, the
book's driving me nuts. I can’t
explain it, but, I'm imagining all
(MORE)
49.

WALTER (CONT'D)
sorts of weirdness. It's like it's...
imitating my life.

AGATHA
Is this what you've been doing all
day?

WALTER

How does he know so much about me?
Why did he chose me?

AGATHA
He didn't.

WALTER
Why can't you see it? You've read it
and you know me better than I do!

Agatha takes the book, opens to his bookmark -- about halfway.

AGATHA
You haven't even finished it.

WALTER
I've read all I need to read.

AGATHA
You've read all you want to read.
You've concerned yourself with the
minutia and drawn wild conclusions
from them, What about the fact that
Fingerling kills Fabrizia then
confesses and is sentenced to life
in an asylum?

WALTER
He kills her?

AGATHA
Stabs her to death.

She thrusts the book into his hands, turns, and walks out.
INT. KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON
Agatha is chopping vegetables.

Walter appears in the back doorway with a SHEET OF PAPER. He
watches Agatha, lovingly. Suddenly he notices THE KNIFE.

He walks up and, from behind, takes it from her. She swivels
around but before she can say anything she notices his eyes
are tearing up. He puts the knife in the sink. Takes her hand.
50.

WALTER
Follow me.

INT, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Walter leads Agatha in.

WALTER
Why this color?
AGATHA
What?
WALTER
Why did you choose this color? For
the walls. -
AGATHA

Walter, no more games.

She pries her hands free and walks to the door. Walter's
words stop her in her tracks.

WALTER
I dreamt I killed you.
(a beat)
Last night. With a knife. While you
slept. Just like Fingerling did.

AGATHA
Walter, this isn't funny.

WALTER
No, it isn't.

He looks at LOVING FAMILY PHOTOS on the mantelpiece.

WALTER
Sure, there are discrepancies.
Fingerling’s a cop. I'm a dogcatcher.
He met Fabrizia when he was 21 whereas
I met you when I was...

AGATHA
Twenty... three.

WALTER
Do you remember the day we met?

AGATHA
Of course I do. September 14th.

WALTER
Nine fourteen. 9 plus 14 is...
51.

AGATHA™
Twenty... three.

WALTER
The day we married?

AGATHA
A month later. October... 13th.

A solemn beat.

WALTER

Suicide gal said it ruled her world.
She killed because of it. Then she
passed it on to Fingerling. On his
birthday. He found it applied to
him, and look what it made him do.
Don't you see, Ag? Fingerling called
it fate. Do you know what fate is?

He hands her the sheet of paper. "FATE" is written on it,
along with its value, which is...

WALTER
Thirty two. 23 reversed. I love you,
and would never ever harm you, but
Fingerling said that, too. I'm scared,
Ag. I'm so, so scared.

He wraps his arms around Agatha. Over his shoulder, she stares
at "The Number 23."

INT. KITCHEN ~ EVENING

The Sparrows sit around a foodless table. Robin is building
a HOUSE OF CARDS.

The doorbell RINGS. Robin runs to it. Seconds later, he
veturns with a PIZZA.

ROBIN
Nineteen ninety-five plus tip, he
said. Fifteen percent is...

WALTER
Twenty three.

Agatha hands Robin twenty five.

AGATHA
Tell him to keep the change.
52.

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Agatha pretends to read but secretly watches Walter stare at
"The Number 23." Robin, scribbling into a schoolbook, looks up.

ROBIN
We live at number 1814.

Walter and Agatha look at him, confused.

ROBIN
1814? 18 is 1 plus 8 which makes 9.
9 plus 14 is 23. Big deal, you might
say? Well, what's strange is this.
Look at it the other way around: 14
is 1 plus 4 which makes 5, and 18
plus 5 is also 23.

AGATHA
Don't talk nonsense, Robin.

ROBIN
It's not nonsense. 18 plus 5 ig 23.
That's not all. 18 plus 14 is 32.

WALTER
Twenty-three reversed.

ROBIN
Spooky, huh?

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
Agatha pulls the covers back for Walter. He hesitates.
AGATHA
Everything is going to be fine.
Nothing's going to happen to me. You
love me. I love you.

He gets into bed. Agatha kisses him and snuggles close. Walter
clicks off the light.

DISSOLVE TO:
DARKNESS - WALTER

awakes. He turns to the clock. It's 3:22 a.m. Suddenly, the
next number falls, CLICKING THUNDEROUSLY to 3:23.

Walter rises.
INT. STAIRCASE - NIGHT

He heads downstairs.
53.

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
He pauses by the kitchen.

CUT TO:
EXT. THE SPARROW HOME - MORNING
The sun is coming up. Birds are chirping.
SUPER UP: FEBRUARY 6
INT. BEDROOM - MORNING

Agatha's outline is visible under the covers. An agonizing
beat. -:

She stirs. A hand appears, plops down on Walter's side.
Agatha’s head emerges. Walter's side of the bed is empty.

INT. LIVING ROOM - MORNING
Agatha enters.

Walter is fast asleep on the sofa. His feet protrude from
under a blanket. They are BOUND TOGETHER.

INT. OFFICE - MORNING

The SKELETON from Walter's birthday hangs in a corner. Isaac
(a psychology professor) finishes a silent read of a LETTER
FROM AGATHA. He wears a YELLOW TIE. He looks up.

Walter gazes out the window (we're high up) at the surrounding
UNIVERSITY. Isaac joins him.

ISAAC
Do you regret it? Not finishing
college.

WALTER

My parents' accident changed my focus
in life. As a result, I met Agatha.
No, I don't regret it at all.

(a beat)
Besides, there's something unsettling
about these places.

TSAAC
Probably all the books around the
place. we have five libraries, you
know.

He picks up "The Number 23."
54.

WALTER
Well?

ISAAC
Sounds like a fascinating read.

WALTER
Meaning that's all it is. A book. So
I am crazy.

ISAAC
Good Lord, no. Twenty three is very
good at this particular game.

WALTER
What do you mean? What game?.

ISAAC
Paranoia. Oh yes, there's a fair bit
of literature on the 23 enigma.

WALTER
There is?

ISAAC
There are 23 axioms in Euclid's
geometry. The human body consists of
46 chromosomes, 23 from each parent.
Blood takes 23 seconds to circulate.
Shakespeare was born on the 23rd
April. He died on the 23rd April.
The Mayans believed the end of the
world would occur in 2012. 20 plus
12 is--

WALTER
--twenty three reversed.

ISAAC
Yes. The exact date is December 23rd.

WALTER
So it's true. The number's... God?

ISAAC
Two divided by three is point 666,
666 being the number of the Devil.

WALTER
It's the Devil?

ISAAC
What's true is that certain people
take delight in perpetuating the
number's infamy. Aleister Crowley.
(MORE)
55.

ISAAC (CONT'D)
R A Wilson. William S. Burroughs
gave it a certain degree of
credibility when he noted a 23
connection between a boat sinking
and a plane crash.

WALTER
What kind of connection?

ISAAC
Burroughs knew a Captain Clark who
ran a ferry from Tangiers to Spain.
One day, Clark told him he'd been
doing so for 23 years without
accident. That day the ferry sank,
killing Clark and all his passengers.
Burroughs got home, turned on the
radio and heard that an airplane
traveling from New York to Miami had
just crashed also. The Captain was
named Clark, too. No prizes for
guessing what the flight number was.

WALTER
I'm not the only one. It’s
omnipresent.

ISAAC
Some would say of course. After all,
the world does spin on an axis of 23
degrees. 23.5 if you want to be picky,
but 5 is simply 2 plus 3.

WALTER
But 23 is also the lowest number
unattainable on a dartboard with
only one dart.

ISAAC
True. Interesting that your name
begins and ends with Ww.

WALTER
W is the 23rd letter of the alphabet.

ISAAC
I do believe there are no names in
the Bible beginning such. The Book
of Revelations has only 22 chapters,
you know, and that predicts--

WALTER
--the end of the world.
(MORE)
56.

WALTER (CONT'D)
{points to "The Number 23")
And that predicts the end of my world.

ISAAC
Yes, it sounds like a most fascinating
book.

Walter paces, his distress suddenly worrying Isaac.

He passes

ISAAC
Of course, there exist far too few
stories where the main character
plays the saxophone. I used to play,
you know. Always fancied myself as
the next John Coltrane. I wasn't.
aware you also played. Agatha's always
said you were... well, not much of a
hobby person.

WALTER
I'm not. And no, I don't play the
saxophone. But that's just it. Not
everything matches. Help me. Please.

ISAAC
I'm not a psychiatrist.

WALTER
I don't want to see a psychiatrist.

ISAAC
I'll see what I can dig up, and I
can speak to Agatha if you like,
but, as far ag you are concerned...

the book back.

ISAAC
Finish it. A cake's true flavor cannot
be ascertained while still in the
bowl. If, after reading it in its
entirety you still believe its subject
to be you, then whoever wrote it
knows you very well.

INT. ACO OFFICE - DAY

Dr. Mortimer studies Walter. She smiles, takes a PEN from
her now full pencil-holder mug.

DR. ALICE MORTIMER
Five days' emotional leave never
hurt anyone.
57.
INT. CAKE SHOP - DAY
Agatha decorates a cake in the shape of a KEY.

AGATHA
Emotional leave?

WALTER
A whole week! Can you believe it? I
can't get over how easy it was to
fool her.

AGATHA
Walter, you lied to her.

WALTER
I had to ensure my job wouldn't be
jeopardized.

AGATHA
But you've never lied before.

WALTER
I've never had to. Listen to me, Ag,
I'm Unit 5. Five! Five is simply 2
plus 3. Isaac's words, exactly.

AGATHA
Isaac said that to you?

WALTER
He was wearing a yellow tie. Yellow
is 92, or four 23s. Dr. Mortimer?
She has a mug on her desk which she
uses as a pencil holder. It was empty
last time yet this time there were
23 pencils in it. Every time I look
at the clock--

He glances at a clock on the wall. It's 11:21 a.m.

AGATHA
21. Not 23. And no, it's not slow.

WALTER
1 and 1 plus 21 is 23. 11 times 2
plus 1 is 23. 11 plus 21 is 32 and
you know what 32 is!

AGATHA
Walter, what's happening to you?
You're insane! What's happened to
the fun-loving, dog-catching man I
love?
58.

WALTER
I'm still a dogcatcher, Ag.
(a beat)

How many cakes are in this room?

AGATHA
I don't know. Lots.

A beat. Agatha counts the cakes on display. The 'key' makes...

AGATHA
Twenty three.

WALTER
I need to do this, Ag. For us.

AGATHA
Fine. Stay home and read the damn
thing. The quicker you finish it, the
quicker ‘us' can get back to normal.
Walter kisses her and leaves. Agatha picks up a PHONE.
INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
Walter nestles in his armchair. Takes a deep breath. Reads:
WALTER (V.O.)
"The nightmare wasn't an isolated
incident.”
INT. FINGERLING'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Fingerling and Fabrizia are asleep.
WALTER (V.O.)
“Over the next few days I couldn't
decide what was worse. Being asleep."

Fingerling bolts upright.

WALTER (V.0O.)
"Or being awake."

He checks the time -- 02:30 a.m.
INT. FINGERLING AND FABRIZIA'S KITCHEN - MORNING
Fingerling cuddles Fabrizia from behind as she prepares
breakfast. Suddenly he reaches for a knife and slits her
throat...

WALTER (V.O.)

"Sometimes it was impossible to tell
the difference."
59.

...before Fabrizia twists around in his grasp and feeds him
a spoonful of yogurt, waking him from his macabre trance.

INT. RESTAURANT - EVENING
WALTER (V.0.}
"Pabrizia began to resent my sudden
sharing of her favorite word.”

Fabrizia finishes a head-count and looks at Fingerling.

FINGERLING
See? It's bi-zarre.

WALTER (V.O.)
"She adopted a new word. Or rather,
a phrase."

FABRIZIA
You are so in-sane.

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

Walter looks up. Thoughtful.

FLASHCUT: AGATHA SAYS, "YOU'RE INSANE!"
He dismisses it. Continues.

WALTER (V.0.)
"Occasionally she added a word..."

INT. FINGERLING AND FABRIZIA'S KITCHEN - DAY
Fabrizia lies on the floor, naked, naughty bits obscured by
WHIPPED CREAM, Fingerling is atop her, examining the whipped
cream easy-squeeze bottle.
FABRIZIA
You are so FUCKING in-sane. Stop
counting the calories and fuck me!
INT. POLICE STATION - DAY
The Sergeant studies Fingerling's phone.
WALTER (V.O.}
"My Sergeant notices subtle changes
in my behavior."
All the numbers have been SCRATCHED OFF the buttons.
INT. SERGEANT'S OFFICE - DAY

Fingerling is with his Sergeant.
60.

WALTER (V.O.}
"He decides I need heip."

INT. POLICE PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE - DAY

Fingerling browses while the intellectually dashing DR. MILES
PHOENIX takes notes.

FINGERLING
"Suicide Gal's name was Isobel Lydia
Hunt. 62, 51, 63, reducible to 8, 6,
9. Twenty three."

DR. MILES PHOENIX
What do you think that means?

Fingerling gazes out the window. Everywhere he looks 2s and
3gs_seem to sparkle, like stars at night.

FINGERLING
I don't know.

INT. SERGEANT'S OFFICE - DAY

The Sergeant stares at a GUN and BADGE on his desk. He turns
to the window, sees Fingerling clearing his desk.

WALTER (V.O.)
"The wise Dr. Phoenix recommends I
take a break. Like time is gonna
heal me. All time is is a counting
system. Numbers with meaning
attached to them. Still, a break
is what the good doctor prescribed.
He called it--"

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
Walter pauses.

WALTER
--emotional leave?

INT. FINGERLING'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

WALTER (V.0.}
"Fabrizia was not impressed."

Fingerling hangs up his uniform. Fabrizia is in bed.

FABRIZIA
So you're not a cop anymore?
61.

FINGERLING
Yes, I'm still a cop. Just a cop on
holiday.

FABRIZIA

Without a gun.

FINGERLING
I still have these.

He holds up his HANDCUFFS and gets into bed.

FABRIZIA
Let's just get some sleep tonight.

She kisses him on the cheek, rolls over and kills the light.

WALTER (V.O.)
"She didn't understand."

In the dark, the digital alarm clock clicks to 00:23.
INT, FINGERLING AND FABRIZIA'S APARTMENT - MORNING

Fingerling sits in his robe staring blankly at a wall, a
notepad in his lap. Words and numbers fill the page.

WALTER (V.O.)
"Which was fine, because neither did
zr."
Fabrizia enters, ready for work. She rips off the top page
and tears it up. The page below shows more of the same. She
tears that up, too. The whole pad is full.
She tears up the whole pad and leaves for work.
INT/EXT. SUICIDE GAL'S APARTMENT - DAY
Suicide Gal stares at the French doors ~- still open.
WALTER (V.O.)

"All I knew was, the number had gone
after Suicide Gal."

 

She races towards them... out onto the BALCONY... and off...
flying like a bird without wings... SIDEWALK looming...

INT, FINGERLING'S BATHROOM - DAY

WALTER (V.0.)
"And now it was coming after me."
62.
Fingerling, dry and in a towel, stares at the SHOWERHEAD in
fear. He backs out, into the BEDROOM, stumbling to the floor
in front of FABRIZIA'S OPEN CLOSET.
He counts her SHOES. 22 pairs. And one empty space.
EXT. STREET - DAY
Fingerling stands in the middle of the street.
Wherever he looks he sees the number: on license plates, in
shop windows, hidden in door numbers, graffitied on walls, a
man at a phone booth punches 2-3-2-3-2... it's EVERYWHERE.
INT. FINGERLING AND FABRIZIA'S APARTMENT - EVENING

Fabrizia is CHOPPING onions for what would be spaghetti
bolognaise.

Fingerling is in an armchair, secretly tearing page 23 from
books. The CHOPPING NOISE stops.

FABRIZIA (0.S.)
What the hell?

He quickly shuts the book, thinking he's been rumbled.

FABRIZIA
What are these doing in the trash?

She holds up a PAIR OF HER SHOES, now covered in vegetable
scraps.

She picks up a saucepan, walks over to Fingerling, and empties
the contents (tomato sauce) over his head.

INT. DR. MILES PHOENIX'S OFFICE - DAY
Dr. Phoenix looks at a PHOTO of Fabrizia.

DR. MILES PHOENIX
I can speak to her if you like.

Fingerling lifts his head out of his hands.
WALTER (V.O.)
"I believe he said it in total
innocence at the time.”
EXT. STREET - DAY
Fingerling watches a COFFEE SHOP opposite.

THROUGH THE WINDOW, we see Fabrizia chatting to Dr. Phoenix.
She walks to the rear of the shop. He follows.
63.
INT. COFFEE SHOP RESTROOM - DAY

Fingerling climbs onto a TOILET SEAT and peers into the NEXT
CUBICLE, where Fabrizia and Dr. Phoenix are kissing.

WALTER (V.O.)
"Yes, at the time I believe he said
it in total innocence. But looking
back...
INT. DR. MILES PHOENIX'S OFFICE - DAY

Dr. Phoenix looks at a photo of Fabrizia, says (MOS) "I can
speak to her if you like.” Fingerling lifts his head.

WALTER (V.0O.)
...I wish I'd reacted differently."

EXT. STREET - DAY
There's a SCREAM... pedestrians glance about... then...

Dr. Phoenix HITS the sidewalk, shards of glass raining down
seconds later -- the remnants of his window.

INT. DR. MILES PHOENIX'S OFFICE - DAY
Fingerling looks at Dr. Phoenix opposite him.
WALTER (V.O.)

"I should have realized the truth. I
know it's absurd, but, even the color
of his tie betrayed him."

Dr. Phoenix wears a yellow tie.

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

Walter’s mouth falls open.

FLASHCUT: ISAAC IN HIS YELLOW TIE.

Walter freezes. Looks back at the book, checking a previous
passage.

WALTER
"I can speak...

FLASHCUT: ISAAC SAYS, "...I CAN SPEAK TO AGATHA IF YOU LIKE.”
Walter paces.

FLASHCUT: FABRIZIA AND DR. PHOENIX KISS. THEIR FACES MORPH
INTO THOSE OF AGATHA AND ISAAC...
64.
Walter stares at the PHOTOS on the mantelpiece. The one on
the end is of Agatha and Isaac. He grabs the phone. Dials.
It RINGS.

WALTER
Come on, come on.

The phone just RINGS and RINGS.
EXT. STREET - DAY

Walter walks along, muttering quietly, trying to convince
himself of something not being true.

He passes LIP-LOCKED LOVERS in a doorway. Stares at them,
bizarrely transfixed. A sign in a LAWYER'S WINDOW reads
"DIVORCES FROM $230." Next, he sees a FUNERAL HOME.
Walter starts to run, pushing his way through the crowds.
EXT. CAKE SHOP - DAY

Walter runs up. The shop is dark. A sign says, "CLOSED FOR
LUNCH."

WALTER

She doesn't close for lunch. Besides

it's...
He looks at a CLOCK DIAL on the building opposite. It clicks
to 3:23. He backs away. Freezes. His eyes are transfixed by
an APPROACHING BUS.
Zt! Ni 2
He backs away, into A HARDWARE STORE...
INT. HARDWARE STORE - DAY

..-and waits just inside the door until the bus passes.

HARDWARE STORE OWNER (0.S.)
How can I help you?

Her voice makes Walter jump. He turns, sees a WOMAN behind
the counter. He approaches. She's writing a PRICE LABEL.
Walter stares at it: "ONE WEEK ONLY: $23."

HARDWARE STORE OWNER
Hello? Anyone home?

WALTER
Is there a... a coffee shop nearby?
65.

HARDWARE STORE OWNER
Why yes, there's one on the corner.

EXT. STREET - DAY
Walter exits. As he passes the WINDOW he freezes.
The woman hangs the label on a BUTCHER'S KNIFE.

Walter runs to the STREET CORNER. The COFFEE SHOP is across
the road. He freezes, crestfallen.

THROUGH THE WINDOW, we see Agatha speaking to Isaac.

Agatha heads into the rear of the shop...

EXT. UNIVERSITY - DAY

Walter sits on a bench, zombie-like.

Isaac enters a TALL BUILDING in the distance. Walter rises.
INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

Walter goes up.

INT. OFFICE - DAY

Isaac looks up as Walter enters.

EXT. UNIVERSITY - DAY

One of the tall building's windows SHATTER. Isaac flies out.
He SCREAMS, arms flailing, HITS the sidewalk with a THUD.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL - WALTER

still sitting on the bench, staring at the sidewalk, fists
clenched, a mischievous smile on his face -- ng dead Isaac
in_sight.

He awakes from his macabre trance. Unfurls his fists in shock,
His hands begin to shake. He flees.

INT. THE SPARROW HOME - DAY

Walter comes home. Enters the LIVING ROOM. Stares at the
walls. He goes into the KITCHEN, splashes his face with water.

His eyes are drawn to the KNIFE BLOCK.

INT. BEDROOM - DAY

Walter opens Agatha’s closet. Stares at her shoes. Counts
them. There are...

WALTER
Twenty two.

...plus the one empty space he points to as he says:

WALTER
Twenty three.

INT. AGATHA'S LIBRARY - DAY

Walter takes a sheet of paper and attempts to write "DEAR
AGATHA." His hand TREMBLES so much the words are ILLEGIBLE.

He rolls a sheet of paper into the old typewriter. Freezes.
The numbers 2 and 3 are worn off their keys.

INT. STAIRCASE - LATE AFTERNOON

Walter hurries down with a SMALL SUITCASE.

INT. KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON

He puts a BADLY WRITTEN ENVELOPE for "AGATHA" on the table.
EXT. THE SPARROW HOME - LATE AFTERNOON

Walter comes out.

AGATHA {0.S.)
Walter?

She turns up the path. Sees the suitcase.

AGATHA
Where are you going? Walter?

Walter walks up to her and kisses her passionately.

WALTER
I love you. You know that.

He throws his case in the truck and leaves.
INT. KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON

Agatha is reading Walter's note. There are tears in her eyes.
67.
WALTER (V.0.)

...A long time ago we made some vows.

I meant every one of them. That's

why I have to do this. It's just one

night. Please don't try to find me.

Please don't give up on me. Your -

loving, dogcatching husband, Walter.

INT. TRUCK - EVENING

Walter scours the streets for a place to stay. Every hotel
he passes has a "NO VACANCY" sign up.

He pulls over, frustrated. Suddenly, he drives off again.
EXT. "THE _HELL" HOTEL - EVENING
Walter's truck is outside.
INT. HOTEL RECEPTION - EVENING
The CLERK looks at a key rack on the wall.
HOTEL CLERK

Room 27 is the quietest. It's all

the way at the back, no one will

disturb you there.

Walter sees a key hanging from 23.

WALTER
What about 23?

HOTEL CLERK

23 wouldn't behoove your desires.
It's next to the bathroom and we're
experiencing problems with the water
system.

INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - EVENING

Walter unlocks Room 23.

INT. ROOM 23 - EVENING

The walls are SODDEN. Walter opens his case. It contains a
TOILETRY BAG and a few CLOTHES, but otherwise is full of
PHOTOS of Agatha_and Robin.

INT. KITCHEN - EVENING

Both Agatha and Robin push the food around their plates.
68.
INT. ROOM 23 - NIGHT

The photos are all on display. Walter sits in the chair by
the bureau. He opens "The Number 23." Reads its disclaimer.

WALTER
"All the characters in this book are
fictitious, and anyone finding a
resemblance to actual persons, living

or dead, should proceed no further.”

He turns to the front cover. Determined:
WALTER
‘I have news for you, Mr. Kretts, you
sonofabitch.

He finds where he left off.

WALTER (V.O.)
The rest of the book was as I feared.

INT. FINGERLING AND FABRIZIA'S KITCHEN - DAY

Fabrizia, all dressed-up, examines discarded cartons and
boxes (of milk, juice, various foodstuffs, etc.) in the trash.
TINY HOLES have been cut into them, removing all the numbers.
She opens the fridge. All the food and liquids are in LITTLE
BAGGIES. She picks up what is probably milk. The bag BURSTS
open all over her,

INT. FINGERLING AND FABRIZIA'S APARTMENT - DAY

Fabrizia yells at Fingerling. He takes it -~- meek and gutless.
INT. FINGERLING AND FABRIZIA'S APARTMENT - EVENING

Fingerling scribbles on the once-clean walis.

He looks up as Fabrizia exits the bedroom in a long leather
coat.

EXT. WOOD - EVENING
Fingerling peeks out from behind a tree.
HIS POV: the tree stands on THE FRINGE OF A PARK and twenty-

odd yards away, Fabrizia, her coat spread open, is staked to
the ground under the moonlight as Dr. Phoenix ravishes her.
69.

INT. FINGERLING AND FABRIZIA‘S APARTMENT ~ MORNING

Fingerling opens Fabrizia's closets and drawers -- all empty.
He runs into the LIVING ROOM, scans the place. It looks
different -- it's lost that woman’s touch.

He sees Fabrizia's ENGAGEMENT RING on the KITCHEN COUNTER
beside a newspaper dated NOVEMBER 23RD. He tears a NOTE off
the fridge: "DEAR FINGERLING, GOODBYE...”

EXT. FINGERLING'S BALCONY - NIGHT

Fingerling plays the sax. Tears stream down his cheeks.
INT. FINGERLING AND FABRIZIA'S APARTMENT - SUNRISE

Fingerling stares at Fabrizia's letter. He starts mumblin
to himself and crosses out letters. First go all the Ws...

He stops. Nearly all the letters have been crossed out. The
ones that remain spell: "KILL HER."

INT, HARDWARE STORE - DAY

Fabrizia and Dr. Phoenix buy a BUTCHER'S KNIFE. Fingerling
spies on them through an aisle's shelves.

They leave, LAUGHING. Fingerling emerges. Walks to a display.
Sees THE KNIFE, a special offer at $23.

INT. DR, PHOENIX'S BEDROOM - EVENING

Fabrizia is in bed, eyes closed with wrists tied to the posts
and a sheet over her body. A MAN IN A SKI MASK enters.

He straddles her, slowly peels back the sheet. He freezes,
for her torso is BLOODY. He tugs off his mask -- Dr. Phoenix.

Behind him, Fingerling creeps out of the closet with a KNIFE.
INT. FINGERLING'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Fingerling awakes from a NIGHTMARE. He stares at the empty
bed beside him. Turns to his reflection in the mirror. Hurls
the sax at himself.

EXT. ROOFTOP - DAY

Fingerling teeters on the edge... but isn't brave enough.

INT. SERGEANT'S OFFICE - DAY

The Sergeant is on the phone. Fingerling enters. He mouths
the words, "HELP ME."
70,
INT, COURTROOM - DAY

The Sergeant dips his head as a JURY FOREMAN announces the
"GUILTY" verdict.

Fingerling mouths the words “THANK YOU" to the JURORS then
turns to the JUDGE. As the Judge sentences him, Fingerling's
jaw drops in horror.

EXT. ASYLUM FOR THE CRIMINALLY INSANE - DAY

A BUS passes through the main gates, Fingerling's frantic
face squashed up against the window.

INT. PADDED CELL - DAY

Fingerling paces about, his fingers curling and uncurling in
frenzied fashion, as if counting. He SCREAMS, runs into a
wall, headbutting it. He bounces back unhurt.

INT. CONSULTATION ROOM - DAY

Fingerling drops to his knees and, hands clasped together,
pleads with his DOCTOR.

The Doctor takes pity, slides a JOURNAL and PENCIL across
the table. Fingerling grabs it, thankful.

INT. PADDED CELL - DAY

The Doctor runs in. Fingerling, calm and at peace with the
world, lies on the floor, DEAD. A POOL OF BLOOD SEEPS FROM
HIS HEAD, THE PENCIL EMBEDDED DEEP INTO HIS SKULL.

WALTER (V.O.)
It wasn't the happiest of endings.

The journal, now titled "THE NUMBER 23," lies beside him.
INT. ROOM 23 - NIGHT
Walter turns to the last page.

WALTER (V.O.)
Not by a long shot.

The final word is "END" and written below each letter is its
value: E=5, N=14, D=4. 5+14+4=23.

WALTER (V.O.)
Unlike Fingerling, the number survived
to live another day.

Walter closes the book. Moves to the window. Stares at the
graveyard across the street. His reflection is ODDLY BLURRED.
71.

WALTER (V.0O.)
Or rather, to kill another day...

EXT. GRAVEYARD - SAME
Ned stares up at Walter. He draws the curtains.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. TRUCK - MORNING
Walter gazes at his home down the street.
SUPER UP: FEBRUARY 7

Robin exits in his school uniform. He heads in the opposite
direction. A CAR passes him, pulls up outside the house.

Isaa¢ gets out. Knocks on the door. Agatha answers. She's
still in her nightgown. She invites him in.

Off Walter's look of despair we DISSOLVE TO:

INT. THE SPARROW HOME - MORNING

Walter creeps in. The LIVING ROOM is empty. He stares up the
staircase. Goes into the KITCHEN. Grabs a BUTCHER'S KNIFE,
studies his REFLECTION in the blade. Shit, for a second he
looked just like...

But now he's turned and is heading UPSTAIRS. He strides to
the BEDROOM when a NOISE comes from the BATHROOM -- the sound
of WATER MOVEMENT followed by a LOUD GASP FOR AIR. He pauses.

AGATHA (0.S.}
Again.

Walter THROWS open the bathroom door, revealing...

Isaag_and Agatha in the bath together, Isaac holding Agatha

under_the water.
Walter raises the knife and we CUT BACK TO:
INT. WALTER'S TRUCK - MORNING

Walter, imitating his nightmare, pummels his steering wheel
with downward strokes.

He slows. Catches sight of himself in the mirror -- crazed,
inhuman. Not himself. He starts to cry.
72.
EXT. STREET - DAY

Walter trudges along, aimless. He stops. Stares at his
reflection in a TAROT PARLOR window. He's FINGERLING. He
rubs his eyes. Looks again. He's WALTER.

The TAROT READER opens the door.

TAROT READER
Tell you your future for twenty
dollars?

WALTER
What if I already know it?

EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY
Located in a quaint, COBBLESTONED street.
INT. POLICE STATION - THE SERGEANT'S OFFICE - DAY

Walter sits quietly while SERGEANT CROMWELL J. BURNS: studies
the book.

SERGEANT BURNS
Mr. Sparrow, I can't arrest you for
a crime you haven't committed,
especially one you fear you'll commit
because of a book.

WALTER
It's not just a book.

SERGEANT BURNS
Yes. So you've said.
(sighs; a beat)
Know why I have these stripes?

WALTER
You're the Sergeant.

SERGEANT BURNS
Know why some cops make Sergeant and
others don't? They're good with
people. Good at knowing people, being
able to read them. I look at you and
I don't see a killer. I see a man
whose only crime is he loves his
wife too much. I suffer from the
same condition.

He points to a PHOTO OF HIS WIFE on his desk.

SERGEANT BURNS
Go back to her.
73.
EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY

Walter stands on the steps, looking up and down the street.
He sees a PHONE BOOTH.

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
Agatha sits quietly. She's been crying. Isaac is still here.
ISAAC
I was trying to help. All I did was

drive him away.

AGATHA
He is coming back.

ISAAC
T know. I know.
(looks her in the eye)
Only a fool wouldn't.
He moves behind her and gently rubs her back.

AGATHA
You shouldn't be here.

ISAAC
I’m your friend.

AGATHA
I know, but, if he knew...

The phone RINGS. Agatha answers it.

AGATHA
Hello? Walter?

EXT, STREET - DAY
Walter listens into the phone.
AGATHA'S VOICE
Walter, is this you? Walter, talk to
me!
Walter opens his mouth to speak when he hears:
ISAAC'S VOICE
(muted)
Let me try.

Walter sinks his head. When he looks up, everywhere he turns,
2s_and 3s SEEM TO SPARKLE, like stars at night.

He drops the phone. Flees.
74.
INT. “THE _HELL" HOTEL - DAY

Walter, hot and sweaty, bursts through the doors, heads to
the elevator.

INT. MENS' BATHROOM - DAY
YMCA-style, a long line of basins opposite showers.

Walter splashes water on his face. Stares into the mirror.
His focus shifts to the showers behind. He approaches one.

FLASHCUT: FINGERLING STARES AT THE SHOWERHEAD IN FEAR.

Walter counts the holes in a showerhead.

WALTER
{nearing the end)
...66, 67, 68...

The shower SPITS OUT WATER at him with a HISS. Walter YELPS,
staggers back, stumbles to the floor.

INT. ROOM 23 - DAY

Walter presses the door shut and leans his head against the
wood. Something off to one side draws his eye. The wallpaper
is peeling away, the ol aper visible underneath.

"23" is ETCHED INTO IT.

WALTER (V.O.)
The number had gone after Fingerling.

He stares at the room. Suddenly, a long, sodden strip of
wallpaper on the bathroom-facing wall peels away revealing A
MASS OF SCRIBBLES AND NUMBERS.

WALTER (V.O.)
And now it was coming after me.

Another strip of paper PEELS AWAY. And another. And another.

Walter grabs the door handle, CRAZED SCRIBBLES AND THE NUMBER
23 appearing all around him.

The door STICKS. He tugs it again and again, until finally
it flies off its hinges.

INT. CORRIDOR - DAY
Walter races to the ELEVATOR. Hits the button. Floor lights

2 and 3 flash continuously. He panics, has trouble breathing,
sees the STAIRWELL.
75.
EXT. ROOF OF HOTEL - DAY
Walter crashes out. Inhales deeply.

He moves to the edge, stares at the world around him, finding
some connection to 23 everywhere.
WALTER
Why? Why me? What have I done to
deserve this?

Suddenly he pauses. He is dangerously close to the edge...
yet that's not why he has paused. He frowns.

A DOG
sits on the CHURCH STEPS far below. It's staring at him.

EXT. "THE _HELL” HOTEL - DAY

Walter exits. The dog hasn't moved. It has black, bottomless
eyes and a silver collar.

WALTER
Ned?

Ned GROWLS. -

WALTER
You sonofabitch. This is all your
fault. If you hadn't made me late...

He takes his TRANQUILIZER GUN from his truck. Loads it. Walks
towards Ned. Aims. Just before he can fire, Ned bolts into
the graveyard.

WALTER
Oh no you don't. This time you don't
get away.

Walter holds up his hand and steps into the road, forcing a
car to SQUEAL to a stop.

EXT. GRAVEYARD - DAY
Walter follows Ned down row after row of graves -- the same
direction as before. Our POV shifts to behind walter, as if
someone follows him.

Ned disappears around the other side of THE GRAVE.

Walter inches up. Peers over the top. Ned is sitting on the
GRAVE, He HOWLS.
76.

WALTER
Now, now. Don’t cry. Just you rest...
in... PEACE!

He FIRES! The dart sticks into Ned's chest, takes immediate
effect, and he falls asleep.

Walter looks at LAURA TOLLINS' grave. She lived from "FEBRUARY
9, 19-- to FEBRUARY 10, 19--" (23 years later).

WALTER
Oh that's just fucking poetic. Dead
at 23.
{kicks Ned)
You Nasty Evil... Dog.
A beat.
FLASHCUT: THE LAST PAGE OF THE BOOK -- "END."
WALTER

N-E-D? Twenty three.
He stares at Ned ~~ bewildered.

FATHER SEBASTIAN (0.S.)
Ned?

An old priest, FATHER SEBASTIAN, stands at the end of the
aisle. He brushes past Walter and kneels beside Ned.

FATHER SEBASTIAN
I trust there's an explanation for
this?

WALTER
Is this your dog?

FATHER SEBASTIAN
He belongs to Barnaby, my gardener.

WALTER
Where is he? I want to speak to him.

FATHER SEBASTIAN
I see. How's your sign language?

CUT TO:
WALTER - CARRYING NED

fireman-style, as he follows Father Sebastian across the
graveyard.
77.

FATHER SEBASTIAN
No one knows quite how he lost it.
Some say he cut it out himself.

They walk towards a MAN trimming the grass around a gravestone
with a pair of SCISSORS. This is BARNABY.

FATHER SEBASTIAN
Barnaby? You have a visitor.

Barnaby rises. Not only does he have NO TONGUE, but also A
LAZY EYE. He is the SILHOUETTE and decidedly more sinister-
looking up close.

WALTER
Is he... harmless?

FATHER SEBASTIAN
Yes. He also understands everything
you say.

Barnaby takes Ned from Walter's shoulders and strokes him.

WALTER
Don't go getting all teary-eyed over
him. He bit me the other day.

Barnaby pauses on hearing 'BIT.'

FATHER SEBASTIAN
Bit you? But Ned's a sweetheart,
never bitten a soul before.

WALTER
Then what's this?

He rolls up his sleeve revealing the BITE MARK.

WALTER
And what's that?

He points at Barnaby {who is staring at him) and A BITE MARK
on his arm -- albeit, long-since healed.

FATHER SEBASTIAN
Mr. Sparrow, if your intention is to
sue the church, I warn you, God makes
a formidable foe.

WALTER
I want answers. Ask him if the number
23 means anything to him.

FATHER SEBASTIAN
As I said, he understands what you say.
WALTER

(to Barnaby)
What does the number 23 mean to you?

78.

Barnaby continues to stare, then suddenly, moves his hands.

WALTER
What did that mean?

FATHER SEBASTIAN
He says you must have done something
to provoke Ned for him to bite you.

WALTER
Yeah, I stuck my arm out. Now answer
my question. What does the number 23
mean to you?

Barnaby moves his hands again.

FATHER SEBASTIAN
He says, without it, the world would
be in big trouble.

WALTER
What does he-- what do you mean by
that?

Father Sebastian continues to translate (throughout scene).

FATHER SEBASTIAN
How would we get to twenty four
without it?

WALTER
Funny guy, huh? Listen pal, I could
have this mysterious little pet of
yours destroyed, just like that.

He clicks his fingers. A smile creeps over Barnaby’s face at

the very idea.

WALTER
Why'd you name him Ned?

FATHER SEBASTIAN
He didn't. Ned was a stray when he
took him in.

WALTER
He wears a collar.

FATHER SEBASTIAN
Yes, he does.
79,

WALTER
Where did you find him?

FATHER SEBASTIAN

Right here. He likes graveyards.

{not signed)
That's certainly true. Ned accompanies
me whenever I perform a funeral. He's
quite well-known amongst my fellow
clergymen, often goes walkabout to
their graveyards. He sits and stares
at the stones, like he's watching
over them. That's how he got his
nickname -~ 'The Guardian of the Dead.'

Off Walter's look we CUT TO:
LAURA TOLLINS' GRAVE
and Walter, gazing at it.
WALTER

February 10? That's in three days'

time.
INT. CITY LIBRARY - INFORMATION COUNTER - AFTERNOON
Walter approaches a LIBRARIAN.

WALTER
Do you keep old newspapers?

INT. PUBLIC RECORDS ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

HUGE DUSTY TOMES surround Walter. He searches through OLD
NEWSPAPERS.

Suddenly, his jaw drops.
INT. LIVING ROOM - EVENING

Agatha and Robin sit in silence. Agatha gazes at the
mantelpiece -- clear of photos. Isaac enters with two coffees.

HEADLIGHTS suddenly shine through the curtains as a CAR pulls
into their driveway.

ROBIN
Dad!

INT. THE SPARROW HOME - EVENING
Agatha follows Robin from the LIVING ROOM. He flings open

the FRONT DOOR and Walter enters, clutching a bundle of
PHOTOCOPIES. Robin hugs him. Walter locks eyes with Agatha.
80.

WALTER
I'm not insane. It's not just a
number. It screws with your head and
gets you to kill the one you love.
It's true. It's all--

Isaac appears in the LIVING ROOM doorway.

WALTER
--true.

Agatha turns to Isaac.

AGATHA
Perhaps you should be going.

WALTER
No. I want him to stay.

INT. KITCHEN - EVENING

The Sparrows plus Isaac sit at the table. Walter holds up a
PHOTOCOPY. OF A NEWSPAPER ARTICLE. A headline reads: "23-YR~-
OLD STUDENT MISSING, FEARED DEAD" with a PICTURE of a woman
identified as: "LAURA TOLLINS.”

WALTER
Her body's never been found but her
bed was soaked in so much blood...
This is the man who killed her.

He holds up another PHOTOCOPY with the headline "LAURA'S
PROFESSOR DID IT" and a PICTURE of a man, "KYLE FLINCH."

WALTER
Kyle Flinch. The police found the
murder weapon -- a butcher's knife --

in a nearby dumpster. It had his
prints all over it.

Another PHOTOCOPY reads: "PROFESSOR'S PRINTS 'ALL OVER' BLOOD-
STAINED KNIFE." Agatha studies it.

AGATHA
Walter, this happened years ago.

WALTER
Ag, the police discovered he wasn't
just her English professor. They were
lovers. He told them Laura liked to
have her wrists tied to the bedposts.

FLASHCUT: LAURA, IN BED WITH WRISTS TIED TO THE BEDPOSTS,
SAYS, "I'M IN HERE..."
81.
Walter points to a HIGHLIGHTED PASSAGE in one of the articles.

WALTER
How she liked to fool around in parks
at night.

FLASHCUT: FROM BEHIND A TREE, FINGERLING WATCHES KYLE FLINCH
RAVISH LAURA UNDER THE STARS.

WALTER
Said it was her idea to buy the knife,
she wanted to role-play an attack.
He pled innocent but the jury saw
through that little ruse and the
Judge locked him up forever. Remember
what Fingerling does in confinement?

FLASHCUT: FINGERLING SCRIBBLES INTO THE JOURNAL IN HIS CELL.
WALTER
Kyle Flinch is Topsy Kretts. The
book is a kind of warped confession.

ISAAC
A dog told you this?

WALTER
Ned's not just a dog. He's 'The
Guardian of the Dead.'
Silence, until:
ROBIN
Why'd he write it about you? Why
would you want to hurt mom?
Walter looks at Agatha... and Isaac.
INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

Agatha stands by the window, the book in her hands. Walter is
at her side.

AGATHA
Do you remember the name of the
bookstore?

FLASHCUT: WALTER APPROACHES THE BOOKSTORE, "A NOVEL FATE."

AGATHA
There's something I haven’t told
you. I didn't want to... make things
worse.

I didn't choose the book.
FLASHCUT: THE BOOK FALLS OFF ITS SHELF AND LANDS
AGATHA.

WALTER
It chose you.

Agatha gazes at the stars.

AGATHA
In a few hours the sun will rise.
Flowers will open. Birds will sing.
People will wake up and eat breakfast.
Children will wait eagerly in front
of TV sets for the cartoons they know
are going to be on...

Walter stares at the knife block in the moonlight.

Walter climbs onto the bed. Raises the KNIFE in the air.
Waiting. The alarm clock clicks to 02:30. He brings the knife
down. Again. And again.

AGATHA (0.S.)
Walter?

He turns to the door. A light comes on. Agatha stands there.

AGATHA
What are you doing?

Walter looks at the bedcovers. SHREDDED. BLOOD seeping
through. He pulls them back. More blood. Lots. But _NO BODY.

WALTER AWAKES - IT'S DARK

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

The light comes on. Walter stares at the knife block -- QNE
KNIFE IS MISSING.

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

Agatha stares into space. Suddenly she freezes. The bedroom
door is opening slowly.

Walter enters. Agatha shuts her eyes, tight.

Walter tiptoes to the bed. Reaches out. Touches Agatha. Sighs
with relief -- she's alive. He leaves.

Agatha's eyes open. She sits up, her hands coming out from
under the covers. She grips a KNIFE.

INT. TRUCK - MORNING
SUPER UP: FEBRUARY 8
Walter sits with Agatha and Robin.

ROBIN
Please?

AGATHA
No. We shouldn't even have brought
you.
84.

ROBIN
Then can I read the book while you're
gone?

AGATHA
No.

WALTER

Your dad needs the book, son.
EXT. CAR PARK - MORNING

Robin watches from the truck as Walter and Agatha walk towards
a DRAB, INTIMIDATING BUILDING.

Agatha stares at the approaching high walls, covered in BARBED
WIRE. She slows, hands shaking, forehead perspiring -- it's
like the walls are closing in on her.

AGATHA
I can't do this. I'm sorry. I just
can't.

INT, PRISON - VISITING CUBICLE - DAY

KYLE FLINCH sits on the wrong side of the perspex screen
toying with a CROSSWORD. He looks up as Walter approaches.

They study each other, then, just as Walter is about to speak:

KYLE FLINCH
You're two days early.

A stunned beat.

WALTER
You... you knew I would come?

KYLE FLINCH
You always come.
(off Walter's look)
Not today, certainly not tomorrow --
tomorrow's a ‘happy' day -- but on
the 10th... yes, I always have
visitors on the 10th.

WALTER
The day you killed the woman you
loved.

KYLE FLINCH
The day she was taken from me.

WALTER
You like playing with words?
85.

KYLE FLINCH
Words don't judge you. They depend
on you. Much the same as... a dog
and its master.

A beat.

WALTER
Numbers aren't as much fun to play
with, are they?

KYLE FLINCH
A mathematician might disagree.
(a beat)
I don’t recall you having come before.
Usually my visitors are full of
bitterness, though they try to hide
it to appease me.

WALTER
Perhaps I'm different? Because I'm
two days early?

KYLE FLINCH
You're the bird and I'm the worm?
Sorry, but, I still can't help you.
Just as I couldn't help them.

WALTER
How many 'visitors' have you had?

KYLE FLINCH
I've stopped counting. Like you said,
numbers aren't much fun.

WALTER
I'm gonna beat it. The number. I
want you to know that.

Walter puts the BOOK on the counter. Flinch studies it, then,
puzzled, turns his eye on Walter.

KYLE FLINCH
You aren't family, your skin tone’s
not oily enough. Yet, you don’t seem
a friend, either. Which leaves me
wondering... just who you are?

WALTER
You can stop the games. I know you
know who I am.

KYLE FLINCH
I have plenty of time for games, Mr--
86.

A beat, until Walter concedes.

He waits.

He rises.

WALTER
Sparrow.

KYLE FLINCH
--Mr. Sparrow, all the time in the
world. But believe me, this isn’t a
particularly nice place to spend the
night, so I suggest you ask me the
question, I give you my answer, and
then we can both be on our way.

WALTER
Okay. Why did you write it?

KYLE FLINCH

(with a strange smile)
I'll give you ten out of ten for
amusement value.

(a beat)
The correct question, usually said
with a quavering lower lip and tears
in the eyes, is, "Where's her body?"
The answer is, has always been, "I
do not know because I did not kill
her." As for who wrote that, I have
no idea. I must admit, I'm vaguely
interested as to why you think it
was I, but only vaguely. It was nice
meeting you.

WALTER
Sit down, Mr. Kretts. Or I'll prove
to the world that you did kill Laura.

He puts the VARIOUS NEWSPAPER COPIES beside the book. Flinch

stares at

them, his eyes tearing up, reliving the horror.

WALTER
I know this is a warped confession.
But I don't give a shit that you
killed your loved one. All I care
about is how you know so much about
me? Why did you choose me? What is
this 23 phenomenon? Because it’s not
coming true, I promise you. I don't
care how weak and spineless you were,
itm stronger. I WILL BEAT THE NUMBER.

Flinch stares at him, incredulous. He sits back down.
87.

KYLE FLINCH
Do you want to know the worst thing
about my being in prison? My family --
my sister, my parents -- they came
to visit.

KYLE FLINCH
Over time the visits got less. My
sister stopped coming.

KYLE FLINCH
I noticed my mother wouldn't look me
in the eye. Soon she stopped coming.

Eventually my father told me my sister
committed suicide, unable to deal
with having a murderer for a brother.
There were tears in his eyes when he
said it, but they were tinged with
anger, not sadness.

FLASHCUT: KYLE'S FATHER RISES. WALKS AWAY FROM HIS SON.

KYLE FLINCH

That was the last time I saw him.

{a beat)
I didn't get death, Mr. Sparrow, and
they're never letting me out, but
somehow, I think your problems are
greater than mine so I shall give
you the only advice I can. I didn't
kill Laura. I loved her. That's the
truth, for I have no reason to lie
to you. I didn't write that book.
Now, unless I can help you with
anything else...

Walter stares into his eyes.

WALTER
What's your middle name?

KYLE FLINCH
(with a smile)
Jacob,

Walter nods. Collects his stuff. Rises. And walks away.
88.

KYLE FLINCH
Mr. Sparrow?

Walter pauses.

KYLE FLINCH
Suppose I were to write a book? I'd
choose a better name than 'Top
Secrets.'

A beat.
INT. TRUCK - DAY

A wide-eyed Robin sits in the back tracing a finger over the
name "TOPSY KRETTS.”

AGATHA
She was killed with his knife. Police
found it in a dumpster with his prints
and her blood all over it. He had
blood on his hands when he called
911.

WALTER
He's innocent. I know he is.

AGATHA
How do you know?

Walter passes her a pad with "KYLE JACOB FLINCH" on it. Sums
reveal his name equals 19.

WALTER
The killer framed him, Ag.

Silence.
ROBIN
If the book's about a girl's murder,
and the man the police said did it,
didn't do it, then...

WALTER
The killer's still out there.

INT. UNKNOWN STUDY - DAY

A MAN stands by a window, his back to us. He is on the phone.
He hangs up. Turns around.

It is Isaac.
89.
INT. THE SPARROW HOME - SAME

Agatha hangs up the PHONE by the FRONT DOOR. She enters the
LIVING ROOM, where Walter and Robin sit in silence. The BOOK
is on the coffee table. Agatha takes a seat.

Everyone stares at the walls.

AGATHA
Can we sit in the kitchen?

The Sparrows head into the KITCHEN (Robin takes the book
with him). They sit in silence around the kitchen table,
Robin reading the BLURBS on the back of the book.

Walter rises, pours himself some milk. He stares at the mug's
FOTY motif. Empties the milk down the sink.

WALTER
I have to find him.
(off Agatha's look)
I have to. If this bastard framed
Kyle Flinch for Laura Tollins’ murder,
who’s to say he's not planning to...

He can't say it.
WALTER
She died February 10th. Less than 48
hours away.

Robin flicks through the book, sees the MAILBOX ADDRESS inside
the back cover.

ROBIN
I know how we can find him.

INT. TRUCK - DAY
Walter and Agatha watch a MAIL FACILITY across the street.
INT. MAIL FACILITY - DAY
Robin walks up to the CLERK at the counter.
ROBIN
Hi, I'm thinking of getting a box
and was wondering what the deal is?
CLERK
Parents don't like you getting porn

at home, do they? Nine-ninety-five a
month, payable in advance.
90.

ROBIN
Is it a problem if something comes
that’s over-size?
INT, BOX COMPANY - DAY

Walter, Agatha, and Robin watch as a CONFUSED CLERK fills a
HUGE BOX with PLASTIC SNOW.

CONFUSED CLERK
Sure you don't want anything in it?

ROBIN
Just the snow.

The Clerk shrugs and seals the box. Robin hands him a label
for "TOPSY KRETTS..."

CONFUSED CLERK
When do you want it to get there?

WALTER
Tomorrow morning.

CONFUSED CLERK
It'll have to go Fedex.

WALTER
Fine.

CONFUSED CLERK
Is that all?

ROBIN
No. We want a hundred of them.

CONFUSED CLERK
You what?

Agatha hands him a credit card. A clock CHIMES...

EXT. CITY - TIME-LAPSE SEQUENCE

The sun sets, the moon appears, and the city shuts down for
the night. The chiming continues into sunrise. One last chime
(the seventh) and we CUT TO:

INT. THE SPARROW HOME - MORNING - VARIOUS SHOTS

The LIVING ROOM clock shows 7 a.m.

SUPER UP: FEBRUARY 9

Walter stares into the HALLWAY MIRROR, nervously trying to
perfect his tie.
91.
Agatha stares into the BATHROOM mirror. She exits, passes
Walter, and heads DOWNSTAIRS to the KITCHEN where she collects
her HANDBAG. Her eyes fall on the knife block. It's FULL.

Robin fusses with his tie in his BEDROOM mirror. He slips a
PENKNIFE into a pocket and takes one last look at his room.

Walter and Robin enter the KITCHEN. Agatha takes Robin's
hand and walks him to the front door.

Walter checks the back door is locked. On leaving the kitchen,
he pauses. There's an EMPTY SLOT in the knife block.

EXT. MAIL FACILITY ~ MORNING

Walter's truck pulls up across the street. A CAR (hereafter
known as 'THE MYSTERY CAR’) pulls up a few cars behind them.

INT. TRUCK - MORNING
The Sparrows sit and wait. Agatha is a bundle of nerves.
AGATHA
He might not be the author. He could
be his agent... his publisher... he
might not even have met the man. It
might not even be a man.

WALTER
We'll know soon enough.

He points to a FEDEX VAN.

The FEDEX GUY enters the mail facility, exiting a few seconds
later with the Clerk. He opens the back of his van. The Clerk
is not pleased. The Fedex Guy shrugs and begins unloading.
The Clerk storms back inside, picks up the PHONE.

Walter beams proudly at Robin.

INT. MAIL FACILITY - MORNING

Amazing what a hundred, over-size boxes will do to a place.
The Clerk fumes behind the counter.

INT, TRUCK - DAY

The Sparrows watch people enter and leave the facility, blind
to the car that parks in front of them.

An OLD MAN gets out. He crosses over and goes inside.
INT. MAIL FACILITY - DAY

The Old Man rummages through one of the boxes.
92.

WALTER (0.S.)}
You won't find anything in it.

He turns around. Walter, Agatha, and Robin are in the doorway.
CLERK
{to Robin)
Hey, I remember you.
The Old Man stares at Walter. He holds up the book.

WALTER
We meet at last, 'Topsy Kretts.'

OLD MAN
No. This cannot be.

The Old Man clutches his heart and staggers backwards, falling
against the boxes. They slide apart under his weight. SNOW
flies everywhere. He slumps to the floor.

Agatha's the first to react. She inches forward, kneels over
him.

ROBIN
Is he...

AGATHA
Go outside. GO OUTSIDE!

But Robin, like his father, is frozen to the spot. Agatha
begin CPR. After a few breaths, she looks up at the Clerk.

AGATHA
Call an ambulance. Now!

INT. HOSPITAL E.R. - LATE AFTERNOON
Agatha and Robin sit in silence.

Walter stares into an OPERATING ROOM where DOCTORS work
frantically to save the Old Man. Things look grim.

Walter RAPS on the door and SHOUTS:

WALTER
Don't you die on me, old man. You
hear me? Don't you die!
{to the Doctors)
He was alive when we brought him in.
Alive! Don't you dare kill him.

A NURSE exits.
93.
NURSE
I'm sorry, sir, but, I'm going to
have to ask you to calm down.
WALTER
Ask away. My future, my wife's very
life, depends on that man. YOU CAN'T
LET HIM DIE!
The Nurse tries to lead him away.

WALTER
Get off me!

He yanks himself free. A SECURITY GUARD approaches. Agatha,
too.

AGATHA
Walter? Honey? I think you should
take Robin home.

Walter calms suddenly. He turns to Robin -- staring blankly
into space.

AGATHA
He shouldn't be here.

Walter glances back at the Old Man.
AGATHA
I'll stay. I'll call you as soon as
I hear anything.
EXT. HOSPITAL - LATE AFTERNOON

The Sparrows walk to the truck. Agatha kisses Robin, then
Walter.

CUT TO:
UNSEEN PERSON'S POV - WATCHING WALTER

from inside THE MYSTERY CAR across the street. Or are we
watching Agatha? She turns and heads back to the hospital.

INT. HOSPITAL E.R. - LATE AFTERNOON

Agatha approaches the Operating Room. It's empty. She turns
to a passing NURSE.

AGATHA
Where's the old man who was in here?
94,
INT. HOSPITAL - LATE AFTERNOON

Agatha gazes at the Old Man, in bed and hooked up to a LIFE-
SUPPORT MACHINE.

Suddenly his eyes open. He stares at Agatha. Raises his hand.
Beckons her to him.

Agatha, cautious, approaches the bed, The Old Man urges her
closer, wanting to tell her something. She leans over him,
her ear above his mouth. He's about to whisper something...
...when his life-support machine FLAT-LINES.

INT. TRUCK - EVENING

Walter drives in silence. In the back seat, Robin stares
into space, eyes glassy. We enter them...

FLASHCUT: ROBIN STARES AT THE OLD MAN, COLLAPSED ON THE FLOOR.
FLASHCUT: FINGERLING STARES AT OLD MRS. DOBKINS IN HER BED.
Robin awakes from his trance. Pulls a PAD from his pocket...
INT. HOSPITAL - EVENING

Agatha watches as the Old Man is taken from the room, a SHEET
over his head. She turns to a DOCTOR beside her.

DOCTOR
I'm very sorry.

He walks away.

Agatha just stands there. She looks down at her hands. She
holds the 01d Man's PERSONAL BELONGINGS. On top is a WALLET.

INT. TRUCK - EVENING

Walter pulls into the Sparrow driveway. Kills the ignition.
Turns to Robin.

WALTER
You okay?

Robin nods. Walter opens his door.

ROBIN
Dad? Who chose my name? You or Mom?

WALTER
I did. Why?
95.

ROBIN
No reason.

Walter gets out.

Robin stares at the pad. On it is written: "ROBIN WILBERFORCE
SPARROW" and some numbers...

EXT. STREET - EVENING

Agatha, clutching her bag, paces back and forth at the bottom
of A STEEP FLIGHT OF STEPS. She stops. Stares at the steps.

FLASHCUT: YOUNG AGATHA HURRIES DOWN THE STREET, HER VIEW
OBSCURED BY THE CAKE BOX SHE CARRIES. SHE TURNS A CORNER
AND, PASSING THE STEPS, COLLIDES INTO SOMEONE AND TUMBLES TO
THE GROUND.

Agatha opens her bag. Navigating the KNIFE, she pulls out
the Old Man's WALLET. Flipping it open, we see it belongs to
a "DR. SIRIUS LEARY."

She looks up the steps at a tall, grey building.

A SIGN reads: "NATHANIEL'S INSTITUTE."

INT. MYSTERY CAR - SAME

Watching Agatha. She heads up the steps.

INT. NATHANIEL'S INSTITUTE - EVENING

Agatha enters. She heads to the ELEVATORS. Presses up.

INT. ELEVATOR - EVENING

TWO PEOPLE follow Agatha in. One presses 2, the other 3.
Agatha presses 18.

INT. 18TH FLOOR CORRIDOR - EVENING

Agatha checks the floorplan. Turns to her left. She stops by
a door: "DR. SIRIUS LEARY, M.D. EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHIATRY."

She takes a CARD KEY from THE WALLET and swipes it.
INT. DR. SIRIUS LEARY'S OFFICE - EVENING

Wall to wall books. Agatha hovers in the entranceway, her
eyes sweeping the room.

She turns to the FILING CABINETS. Searches them.
96.
INT. THE SPARROW HOME - EVENING
Walter hangs up the HALLWAY phone and turns to Robin.

WALTER
He's dead.

ROBIN
Why hasn’t mom called?

INT. DR. SIRIUS LEARY'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Agatha closes the last filing cabinet. She looks around,
desperate. Sees a SIDE DOOR.

She turns the handle..The door swings open, revealing:

A LABORATORY

with a kind of DENTIST'S CHAIR in the center. Beside it is
an INSTRUMENT TRAY with an ARRAY OF SCALPELS and an UNUSUAL,
DRILL-LIKE TOOL.

Agatha steers clear of the chair. She's drawn towards a TALL,
STEEL CUPBOARD. It's PADLOCKED. She picks up the DRILL and
SHATTERS the lock. The door CREAKS open.

AGATHA'S FACE

pales.

Suddenly, a SHADOW falls over her from the DOORWAY.

She spins around... GASPS... her hand shooting to her mouth...
It's ISAAC.

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Walter sits in his chair, comatose.

Robin sits across from him, gazing at the book. He picks up
a pen. Opens to PAGE 1. Starts CIRCLING every twenty third
word: "THE" "I" "Ig" "Op"

He stops. Ridiculous idea. Puts the book down. A beat.

He picks it up again. Turns to PAGE 23. Does the same thing.
UTE" "YOU" "ARE" "READING "THIS" "YOU" "ARE" "ONTO" "ME"

Robin's mouth falis open. The pen drops from his grasp. We
hear HIS HEARTBEAT -- getting faster... and faster...
97.

Walter looks at him. Robin opens his mouth, but nothing comes
out. Walter takes the book, sees the circled words.

ROBIN
(raspy)
Every twenty-third word.

Walter reads the words. His face changes. He picks up the
pen. Continues on from his son:

WALTER
"I" "warn" "you" "continue" "at"
"your" "peril" "you" "do" "not" "want"
"to" "find" "me"

He continues, but gets gibberish. The next page is the same.

ROBIN

Twenty three words. It's every twenty-
third word, twenty three times, on
page 23.

A beat. Walter flicks ahead to PAGE 46. Tries again:

WALTER
"you'll" "regret"® "this" "you" "fool"
"trust" "me" "once" "you" "learn"
"the" "truth" "there" "can" "be"
"no" "turning" "back" "this" "is"
"your" "last" "chance"

He turns to PAGE 69.

WALTER

"very" "well" "visit" "Casanova"
"spark" "di beneath" "the" "steps"
"to" "heaven" "you'll" "guess" "which"
"one" "I" "warn" "you" “hell” "is"
"waiting" "sparrow" man”

(a beat)
He's talking directly to me. He knows
I'll find him.

 
  

ROBIN
But who's Casanova Spark, dad?

Walter stares at the words, thinking. A beat.

WALTER
Tt's not a person.

EXT. THE SPARROW HOME - NIGHT

Watching the house THROUGH THE MYSTERY CAR WINDOW. Walter
and Robin exit with TWO SHOVELS. They climb into the truck.
98.
Suddenly, the POV SHIFTS to that of...
NED - WATCHING WALTER

from the end of the street. As Walter drives off, Ned turns
to the mystery car. It pulls away from the curb...

EXT. LONELY ROAD - NIGHT
The truck flashes past a sign for "CASANOVA'S PARK."

Seconds later, THE MYSTERY CAR flashes past, its headlamps
dark.

EXT. CASANOVA'S PARK - CAR PARK - NIGHT
Walter and Robin study a MAP DISPLAY of the park's grounds.
EXT, WOOD - DEAD OF NIGHT

Walter and Robin trek through with FLASHLIGHTS. They approach
a CLEARING.

FLASHCUT: FINGERLING SPIES ON FABRIZIA AND DR. PHOENIX THROUGH
THE TREES.

IN THE CLEARING

a SIGNPOST reads: "THE STEPS TO HEAVEN." Below it, another
adds: "WARNING: UNSAFE FOOTING. DON'T STRAY OFF THE PATH."

Robin shines his light on the STEPPING STONES that disappear
through a MARSH into darkness.

ROBIN
How are we gonna guess which one?

Walter stares at TWO EYES glinting at him from the shadows,
quickly recognizing the FAMILIAR SHAPE OF NED.

Walter stares at the stones. Takes Robin's hand. They head
across.

WALTER
One. Two. Three...

AT THE 23RD STEPPING STONE
they stop. The stones continue on to a DUCK POND.

Walter jams his shovel under the stone and levers it aside.
He starts to dig.

DISSOLVE TO:
99.
VIEW FROM THE TREES - WALTER AND ROBIN

are hard at it and have A LARGE PIT to show for their efforts.
Robin pauses.

WALTER
Rest up if you need to.

ROBIN
It's not that. I was just thinking.
(glances about)
What if mom was right? What if that
man wasn't the author? What if he
was only the guy's publisher or
something?

WALTER
Sounds like a lot of what ifs.

ROBIN
But wouldn't it mean the real killer
is still out there?

Robin succeeds in spooking his dad. Walter stops digging,
picks up a flashlight and shines it about. Suddenly...

...WE ARE WATCHING FROM THE TREES AGAIN. We duck behind a
trunk as the light sweeps past.

 

WALTER
You're beginning to sound like me,
kiddo.

He bends to put the light down when he freezes. Stares into
the pit. The flashlight illuminates

A RIBCAGE

poking through the soil.

INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

Sergeant Burns and TWO POLICEMEN approach Walter and Robin.
EXT, CASANOVA'S PARK - NIGHT

Walter and Robin lead them across THE STEPS TO HEAVEN.

Their pace slows near the 23rd stone. Father and son glance
about -- frowning mirror images of each other. Their pit...

...-HAS GONE.
DISSOLVE TO:
100.
SEVERAL HOURS LATER - A COLLECTION OF VERY DEEP PITS

have been dug under various stones. Three pairs of very pissed
eyes are on Walter.

INT. POLICE STATION - VERY EARLY MORNING

Walter paces. Robin sits, studying his surroundings, studying
things... things like the numbers on OFFICERS' UNIFORMS...

WALTER
What's taking your Mom so long?

He tenses... his face drains of color...

DOWN THE CORRIDOR - ISAAC

talks, MOS, to Sergeant Burns.

Isaac sees Walter staring. Isaac doesn't smile. Suddenly...
.. Agatha steps out from a doorway.

She sees Walter, speaks to the Sergeant, and approaches her
family.

AGATHA
I've come to take you home,

EXT. POLICE STATION - VERY EARLY MORNING
Agatha converses with Isaac, MOS.
PULL BACK TO REVEAL - WALTER'S POV

watching out the truck window. Agatha pecks Isaac on the cheek.
Isaac glances at Walter, then walks to HIS CAR (the mystery car).

INT. TRUCK - VERY EARLY MORNING
A LIGHT RAIN is just beginning.
Walter drives. Agatha is quiet. Robin is losing it.

ROBIN

Skeletons don't just get up and walk
away, mom. You were right, that old
man wasn't the killer. The killer's
still out there and he knows dad's
onto him, I found all these secret
messages in the book. Every twenty-
third word--
101.

AGATHA
{to Walter)
How could you let him read it?
ROBIN
He didn’t.
AGATHA

But you just said...
She flicks through the book, stopping at the CIRCLED WORDS.

AGATHA
How did you know to do this?

A beat. Walter looks at Robin.

AGATHA

Listen to me. Both of you. Twenty
three is a number. A god damn number.
There's no curse. There's no killer
running around out there.

{to Walter)
You are not going to kill me. You
love me. You always have. You always
will. The old man is dead. The book
is history. And it's over. Over.

Silence.
Walter turns a corner, HITS HIS BRAKES immediately.
Ned sits directly in his path.

ROBIN
The Guardian of the Dead.

Walter glances at Robin in the rearview mirror, then Agatha.
Suddenly he STEPS ON THE GAS. Ned doesn't flinch, doesn't
even bat an eye, not even when he SLAMS INTO, and OVER HIM.

Fifty yards on he stops. Checks his rearview mirror. Shadows
and raindrops render his view unrewarding. He turns to Agatha.

WALTER
Nasty. Evil. Dead. Dog.

INT. ROBIN'S BEDROOM - DAWN

Robin is in bed. Agatha draws the curtains. It's raining
harder.

SUPER UP: FEBRUARY 10
102.

ROBIN
It was there, Mom.

She kisses him and leaves. As soon as the door closes, Robin
gets up and starts covering his walls with WHITE PAPER.

INT. KITCHEN - MORNING
Walter sits at the table, munching on a SLICE OF APPLE.

The door opens. Agatha enters. Walter picks up a KNIFE. Cuts
another slice of apple.

Agatha stares at the knife. Takes it from him. She sits
opposite and cuts the apple for him, sliding each perfectly
cut segment slowly across the table.

WALTER
Why was Isaac with you?
AGATHA
He was concerned about me. Isaac is

my friend.

Walter's eyes are drawn to her hands... her fingernails...
her MUD-CAKED FINGERNAILS.

She follows his gaze, quickly curls her fingers up. Takes
the knife to the sink. Scrubs her hands. Her back is to him.

WALTER
You.
AGATHA
Don't do this. Please.
WALTER
You moved the skeleton. But how...

unless...

He flips open a PAD. Writes "AGATHA FRANCESCA SPARROW." It
equals 38/70/110. 38=11, 70=7, 110=2. 11+7+2 is... 20?

He stares at the numbers in frustration. Crumples the paper
in his fist. Notices his wedding ring and...

...tries again, but this time with "AGATHA FRANCESCA PINK."
FLASHCUT: SUICIDE GAL SAYS, "YOU KNOW WHAT PINK IS?"
It equals 38/70/50. 38=11, 70=7, 50=5. 11+7+5 is...

WALTER
Twenty three.
103.
Desperate, he tries another method: 38+70+50=158; 15+8 is...
WALTER
Any way I do it, it's twenty-fucking-
three.
FLASHCUT: THE OLD TYPEWRITER -- THE 2S AND 3S WORN AWAY.

WALTER
Oh God...

FLASHCUT: AGATHA SAYS, "I'LL WRITE MY OWN ONE OF THESE DAYS."

WALTER
Dear God...

FLASHCUT: ISAAC SAYS, "WHOEVER WROTE IT KNOWS YOU VERY WELL."

WALTER
You had access to my trunk. You...

FLASHCUT: WALTER SAYS, "YOU KNOW ME BETTER THAN I DO!"

AGATHA
Please don't. I beg you.

WALTER
You're Topsy Kretts?

FLASHCUT: AGATHA SAYS, "HE MIGHT NOT EVEN BE A MAN."

WALTER
You wrote it. Which means...

Agatha faces him, tears in her eyes.

AGATHA
Don't make me do this.

His eyes lower to her hands... and the knife she still holds.
INT. ROBIN'S BEDROOM - SAME

The walls are plastered in paper. Robin scribbles BIZARRE 23
FACTS on them.

INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUED
Walter stares at the knife.
WALTER

You've been pulling the strings all
along.
104.

FLASHCUT: IN THE BOOKSTORE, AGATHA TELLS WALTER, "IT'S GOOD.
YOU SHOULD TRY IT."

FLASHCUT: AGATHA THRUSTS THE BOOK INTO WALTER'S HANDS.

AGATHA
No. That’s not true, sweetie. Just
let it be.

WALTER

All this time, I feared I was going
to kill you, when really--

AGATHA
--stop it. Please, stop it.

WALTER
I will. Just hand me the knife.

AGATHA
No. I can't do that.

Walter glances at the KNIFE BLOCK: two empty slots but still
four more knives available. That is, until...

...Agatha pulls it towards her.
INT. HALLWAY - SAME

Robin stares at his walls. He exits his room and heads to
the STAIRCASE.

INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUED
Walter backs away from the table, scanning the room.
WALTER
Why would you do this to me? I love
you so much.
AGATHA
Do you? Do you really? Is it really
me that you love?

Walter notices AGATHA’S BAG on the counter. SOMETHING ODD
pokes out. He inches his way to it.

WALTER
I've always loved you. My whole life
started with you.

He reaches into the bag and... pulls out THE KNIFE.
105.
INT. HALLWAY ~ SAME
Robin reaches the bottom step and turns to the kitchen.
INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUED
The table separates Agatha and Walter. Both hold knives.
AGATHA
I took it when we went to meet that
man. The one you said you didn't know.
WALTER

The one who died when I left you
with him.

Walter looks around. Everywhere he looks, he sees 23... even
the RAINDROPS ON THE WINDOW seem to be in on it...

Agatha follows his gaze... realizes...

AGATHA
Put the knife down, Walter. You're
scaring me. Don’t you see? You're
making the book come true.

The numbers start to GLOW... to MOVE... as if trying to BREAK
FREE OF THEIR BONDS. All of a sudden...

...the door OPENS, Robin enters. THE NUMBERS VANISH. Robin
freezes. He's between the two of them.

ROBIN
Mom? Dad?

AGATHA
Come to me, Robin. Keep away from
your father.

WALTER
Don't listen to her, son. Come here.
To me.

AGATHA

No! Whatever he says, don't go to him.

WALTER
She's Topsy Kretts. She’s the author.

He shows Robin the pad. Robin stares at the big fat 23.

AGATHA
It's not true. Don't listen to him.

She puts her knife down.
106.

AGATHA
See? Now your father will put his
down. Walter? Honey?

Walter looks about the room again. The numbers HAVE RETURNED.

AGATHA
Put the knife down. You're scaring
Robin. Robin!

Robin is inching towards Walter, his eyes following his dad's
from place to place... and number to number...

WALTER
Tell him the truth. Tell him how you
took the skeleton.

AGATHA
Yes. I took the skeleton.

Robin stops.

ROBIN
You did?

AGATHA
And I'd do it again if I had to. But -
I'm not the author.

WALTER
She's lying.

AGATHA
{to Walter)
Don't do this.

ROBIN
Who wrote the book, mom? Do you know?

WALTER
Tell him. Tell him the truth!

ROBIN
Mom?

A tear falls from Agatha's eye. She looks from Robin to Walter
and whispers:

AGATHA
You did.

A long... mind-fucking... beat.

AGATHA
You wrote it, Walter. You did.
107.
Every line, every furrow on Walter's face comes into play.

Agatha opens the PANTRY and lifts out a BOX. She puts it on
the table. Robin opens it, takes out an old manus¢ript:

"THE NUMBER 23, BY WALTER PAUL SPARROW.”
WALTER

You typed this. You put my name on

it.
Walter flinches as Agatha steps forward. She removes the
cover page, revealing the followin rawl in handwritin
"TQ SIRIUS, IN EXCHANGE FOR MY NIGHTMARES, WALTER, XXX."
She offers him a PEN. He doesn't take it.

WALTER
No. No. You’re lying. She's lying.

Robin moves to his mom's side. She brings in ANOTHER BOX.
Takes off the lid and pulls out a SAXOPHONE.

FLASHCUT: THE SAX SITS ON TOP OF A STACK OF BOXES INSIDE THE
LABORATORY CUPBOARD.

She offers it to Walter. He stares at it. The horn end is
badly dented. He puts down the knife, reaches out and takes
it from her. Odd, his fingers seem to slip into place.

He puts it to his lips and...

...PLAYS. Brilliantly.

VERY SLOWLY, ALL THE TWENTY-THREES IN THE ROOM FADE AWAY.
Agatha takes Robin's hand. Tears stream down their cheeks.
Walter stops. Lowers the sax.

WALTER
I can play.

He picks up the book.

WALTER
It is me,

In his other hand, he takes a KNIFE. Looks at it. Studies
his REFLECTION in the blade and... BECOMES FINGERLING.

: WALTER
Oh God...

FLASHCUT: A CRAZED WALTER SLASHES AT LAURA WITH A KNIFE.
108.
The knife FALLS from his hand.

WALTER
I killed her.

He overturns a box. PSYCHIATRIC FILES, NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS,
PHOTOS, MEMENTOS, etc, spill out. He stares at them, not
comprehending.

Silence.

Walter moves to the phone. Dials 911. It RINGS. Once. Twice.

ROBIN
No.

Robin cuts him off, tears in his eyes.

ROBIN
I don't understand.

WALTER
Either do I, son.

He takes Robin's fingers off the hook. Robin wraps his arms
around him. Walter kisses him on the head, whispers:

WALTER
I love you so much.
ROBIN
What's gonna happen to me without
you?
He looks at his mom, eyes pleading. A beat. Agatha walks to
Walter... takes the phone from him...
AGATHA

You said, your whole life started
with me. Well, my life began with
you, Walter. And it's not going to
end here. I don't know what happened
to you, but I do know this: you
weren't a bad man who got better.
You were a sick man who got well.
Very well.

She hangs up the phone.

WALTER
There's an innocent man in prison, Ag.
109.
AGATHA
And he's lost everything. Nothing we
do will change that, but it will
change what we have.
She picks up his FOTY mug.
AGATHA
You're a wonderful husband and the
best father a son could ever have.
Robin hugs his dad, tight.

AGATHA
And I love you.

She embraces her family.

The doorbell RINGS.

The Sparrows part. Worried looks are exchanged.
INT. THE SPARROW HOME - MORNING

Agatha and Robin watch, hand in hand, as Walter opens the
FRONT DOOR. It's Isaac.

ISAAC
I... I wanted to check...

Walter steps aside. Isaac sees Agatha and sighs with relief.
INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

Agatha, Robin and Isaac enter. Isaac sees the BOXES.

INT. THE SPARROW HOME - SAME

Walter stares at himself in the BATHROOM MIRROR.

He EXITS, trudges past ROBIN'’S ROOM (the door is open). He
pauses. Backtracks.

INT. ROBIN'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Walter steps in. Stares at the walls.

A PAD on the desk draws his attention. It’s the pad Robin
had in the truck and on it Walter sees "ROBIN WILBERFORCE
SPARROW" and the numbers 58/116/110 or 13/8/2 or... 23.

Walter looks at the walls again. He starts to shake.
110.

Agatha, Robin and Isaac sit at the table. Isaac goes to hold
Agatha's hand. She shies away.

The front door SLAMS.
INT. HALLWAY - DAY

Agatha stands in the open front doorway. Robin runs down the
stairs and hugs her.

ROBIN
Where's he gone?

EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY

Walter shuffles along, aimless, He stops. He's at the
University.

EXT. UNIVERSITY GROUNDS - DAY

Walter stares at a CAR PARK. He looks around. STUDENTS mill
about. When he turns back to the car park...

...IT HAS BEEN REPLACED BY A LAWN. There's a CROWD on it. In
the center:

22-YR-OLD WALTER

plays the sax. He finishes up and works the crowd with a
HAT, people dropping coins in then drifting off. He ends at
a YOUNG WOMAN.

YOUNG WOMAN
I've heard it's ali in the tongue.

She wiggles her tongue seductively, drops SOMETHING into the
hat and walks off. Walter examines her ‘donation’ -- A PIECE
OF PAPER with the name "LAURA TOLLINS" and PHONE NUMBER.
BACK TO SCENE - WALTER

walks away from the lawn... and it becomes a car park once
more.

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
Agatha puts the phone down. Hugs Robin.

She looks at Isaac -- the contents of the boxes spread over
the coffee table in front of him.

ISAAC
Does he remember anything?
111.
EXT. UNIVERSITY GROUNDS - DAY
Walter sits on a bench. The following come fast and furious:
PLASHCUT: WALTER AND LAURA, HAND IN HAND.
FLASHCUT: WALTER BUYS AN ENGAGEMENT RING.
FLASHCUT: WALTER IN A LECTURE THEATER. THE WORD "OBSESSION"
ON THE BOARD. BELOW IT, EXAMPLES: SHADOWS, GERMS, TV STARS,
DEATH AND... THE NUMBER 23.

FLASHCUT: LAURA AWAKES IN BED, IS PISSED TO FIND HER SKIN A
MASS OF WILD SCRIBBLINGS.

FPLASHCUT: WALTER, ALL ALONE, CRYING HYSTERICALLY.

BACK TO SCENE - TEARS

flow freely down Walter's cheeks. He rises. Walks off.

EXT. STREET - DAY

Walter trudges along, gazing at SHOP WINDOWS.

FLASHCUT: YOUNG WALTER SCURRIES ALONG, WIELDING A SPRAY CAN,

Walter stops in front of the HARDWARE STORE. The KNIFE has
gone. Suddenly there's LAUGHTER.

LAURA AND KYLE exit the store.
EXT. LIGHT BLUE APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

Walter stares at the WALLS. Suddenly, they BECOME PINK...
the sky DARKENS... EVENING rolls in...

...bringing with it A BATTERED OLD CAR, coasting up,
headlights off. YOUNG WALTER gets out. He looks around
furtively then climbs through an OPEN WINDOW.
‘Walter closes his eyes and we...

CUT TO:
A BLACK SCREEN - SUDDENLY
LIGHT appears. Odd, it's SLATTED...

+..as though we are LOOKING THROUGH A CLOSED CLOSET DOOR
FROM THE INSIDE.

Laura appears. She begins undressing.
112.
EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

Walter's eyes burst open, fixate on the MAIN DOORS. The skies
darken more. It's NIGHT.

‘He' exits (aged 23). He has a PLASTIC BAG with him.

He scurries towards an EXPENSIVE LINCOLN SUV. Climbs onto
its foot ledge as... the SUV morphs into a DUMPSTER.

There's a CLANG as Young Walter empties the bag inside. He
runs back inside the building.

Walter looks at the BATTERED OLD CAR. Walks to it. Reaches
out and pops the trunk. It's empty.

Suddenly, Young Walter appears by his side with LAURA'S
BLOODSTAINED BODY in arms. He dumps her in the TRUNK...

INT. CHURCH - DAY

Walter sits in a pew, not praying, but watching a MAN at the
front who is.

The Man rises. Walks up the aisle. It's KYLE FLINCH. He
pauses, seems to look right at Walter, Walter mouths the
words "I'M SORRY" then, puzzled, turns around.

POLICEMEN block the doors behind him.

INT, LIVING ROOM - DAY

Isaac studies a file.

AGATHA
What happened to him?

ISAAC
It seems he suffered from--

EXT. GRAVEYARD - DAY
Walter stares at Laura's grave.

ISAAC (V.O.)
--terrible nightmares.

He turns to leave and is confronted by DEAD, BLOOD-STAINED
LAURA. She dances around him, repeating "TWENTY THREE" over
and over and over...

Walter clamps his hands over his ears.
113.
INT, LIVING ROOM - DAY

ISAAC
That's why he never finished college.

AGATHA
But I thought... his parents' death...

Isaac cross-checks files.
ISAAC
No, it looks like he'd already dropped
out by the time they died. And he'd
already met Dr. Leary.
EXT. NATHANIEL'S INSTITUTE - DAY

Walter stands across the street, staring at the tall, grey
monolith. He crosses over.

INT. NATHANIEL'S INSTITUTE - DAY

Walter stands frozen in the ENTRANCE LOBBY. The RECEPTIONIST
is a woman with grey hair.

FLASHCUT: THE SAME WOMAN, BEHIND THE SAME COUNTER, BUT WITH
RED HAIR AND LESS LINES ON HER FACE.

Walter walks down a corridor to the elevators, Presses up.
INT, 18TH FLOOR CORRIDOR - DAY
Walter exits the elevator. Turns to his left.

FLASHCUT: THE CORRIDOR AS IT LOOKED YEARS AGO -- DIFFERENT
WALLPAPER, DIFFERENT CARPET, ETC.

Walter stops by Dr. Leary'’s door. Stares at the nameplate.

The door opens. A CLEANING LADY comes out. She's been crying.
She looks at Walter.

CLEANING LADY
Terrible, isn't it?

She leaves the door open for him. Walter sways in the doorway.

As_his eyes swee) he room, little things change: the
daffodils in the vase become irises, photos on the ke

vanish, various books disappear, get newer, etc.
INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

Isaac frowns, incredulous.
114,

AGATHA
What is it?

ISAAC
He confessed.

INT. DR. SIRIUS LEARY'S OFFICE - DAY
Walter (present-day) sits in a chair.

WALTER
I killed her. I stabbed her 23 times.

Suddenly, a younger Dr. Leary materializes in his chair.

DR. SIRIUS LEARY
The feelings you're experiencing are
only natural.

WALTER
No.

DR. SIRIUS LEARY
You blame yourself for her death.
It's called misappropriated guilt.

WALTER
I'm telling you, I killed her!

DR. SIRIUS LEARY
You believe you drove her, through
your obsession, into the arms of
another man, a man who turned out to
be a vicious killer. In your eyes,
yes, you killed her, but the real
killer is in prison.

Walter sinks his head. When he lifts it again, he is Young
Walter.

WALTER
Tell me how to stop the nightmares.

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
Isaac continues.

ISAAC
He told Walter he needed a hobby, a
distraction, something to give his
days meaning. He refused to even
touch a saxophone. The only thing he
talked fondly of was books.

Agatha smiles a weak smile.
115.

ISAAC
Reading 'Fingerling at the Zoo’ was
one of his earliest memories. At one
session he announced--

INT. DR. SIRIUS LEARY'S OFFICE - DAY
Walter gazes out of the window.

WALTER
--I'm going to write a book.

In the distance is a PINK NEON SIGN. It says "_HELL HOTEL.”
INT. ROOM 23 - DAY

Young Walter sits at the bureau tapping away on A TYPEWRITER.
He leans out, writes on the wall.

ISAAC (V.0.)
It took him 23 days. Dr. Leary thought
it was--

INT. DR. SIRIUS LEARY'’S OFFICE - DAY
Walter watches Dr. Leary turn over the last page.

DR. SIRIUS LEARY
Brilliant!

ISAAC (V.O.)
He believed Walter was purging his
undeserved guilt on the page. He
told him to--

DR. SIRIUS LEARY
Publish it!

ISAAC (V.O.)
--thinking it would kick-start a new
life. But Walter had written it to
try and end his nightmares...

Dead, blood-stained Laura WHISPERS "23" to Walter, her tongue
probing the inside of his ear drum.

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
Agatha stares at the MANUSCRIPT.
ISAAC
He refused to have anything more to

do with it and viewed all hobbies as
pointless.
116.
Agatha looks at Walter's BIRTHDAY PRESENTS in the corner.

AGATHA
How did he forget?

ISAAC
Dr. Leary said there was a way to
stop his nightmares. But it was an
experimental procedure--
INT, DR. SIRIUS LEARY'S OFFICE - DAY

Walter opens the door to Dr. Leary's LABORATORY. He sees his
younger self sitting in the chair.

The drill-like tool rests on the instrument tray, BLOODY. A
TUBE sticks out of the side of Walter's head. SEVERAL WIRES
run into it.

Dr. Leary sits at a monitor studying a 3-D image of the brain.

DR. SIRIUS LEARY
Think of Laura.

A part of the brain GLOWS. Dr. Leary flips a switch and a
BOLT OF ELECTRICITY shoots down the wire and into young
Walter's skull. Present-day Walter clutches his head.

ISAAC (V.0.)
--and one hundred percent irreversible.

The image on the monitor STOPS FLASHING.

ISAAC (V.0.)
Or so he thought.

Walter takes his hand from the side of his head. It's BLOODY.
He starts to BREATHE FAST... the room SWIRLS...

INT. 18TH FLOOR CORRIDOR - DAY
Walter stumbles out of Dr. Leary's.
EXT. NATHANIEL'S INSTITUTE - DAY
Walter flees down the steps...
AGATHA (V.0O.)
Dr. Leary published it, didn't he?

He changed the name as a precaution.

ISAAC (V.0.}
Yes. The rest--
117.

AGATHA (V.0.)
--I know.

...spinning back to them at the bottom. A YOUNG MAN is
following him down. Suddenly...

..-HE CHANGES INTO YOUNG WALTER. AT THE BOTTOM HE COLLIDES
WITH A WOMAN AND TUMBLES TO THE GROUND. HE SITS UP, COVERED
IN CAKE.

Walter screams, a WILD, BLOODCURDLING SCREAM:

WALTER
Noooco00000--

He stops, cut_off in his prime. A DOG stares at him from across
the road. It has black, bottomless eyes anda silver collar.

WALTER
What do you want from me!

Ned walks to the end of the street. Walter follows.
Ned barks at a wall. Walter freezes.

WALTER
No. No!

GRAFFITI reads: "LIKE FATHER LIKE SON."
INT. POLICE STATION - DAY
Walter bursts in.

WALTER
I have to speak to Sergeant Burns!

INT. THE SERGEANT'S OFFICE - DAY

Sergeant Burns stares at Walter. Odd, he now has DARK RINGS
under his eyes. He stares at Walter, impassive.

WALTER
I know it's hard to believe, but
please, you have to.

SERGEANT BURNS
Twenty three is just a number.

WALTER
No--

SERGEANT BURNS
--yes! Your wife telephoned. She
said you might pay us a visit.
118.

WALTER
Agatha called you? But, wait, no,
she... she doesn't understand--

SERGEANT BURNS
Then we'll ask her when she arrives.

WALTER
She's coming? No. You don't know
what you've done.
He leaves.

SERGEANT BURNS
Mr. Sparrow! It’s just a number!

Sergeant Burns sighs. He gazes at HIS WIFE's PHOTO, then
slides a PIECE OF PAPER out from a stack. On it are VARIOUS

SCRIBBLES -- WORDS AND NUMBERS. In the middle is the name...
"CROMWELL JOSEPH BURNS”

..,and its value... 101/73/74... 2/10/11... TWENTY THREE.
Sergeant Burns stares at the photo.

SERGEANT
Just a God damn lousy number.

EXT, POLICE STATION - DAY
Walter exits. Ned waits for him.
WALTER (V.O.)
There's no such thing as destiny.
There are only different choices.

There's a HONK. Agatha, Robin and Isaac pull up in his truck
down the street.

Walter looks at Ned. A BIRD suddenly CRASHES into a window
and drops to the ground. Walter flips it over with his foot.
It has a red breast.

Robin clambers out of the truck. Starts running towards him.

Walter looks up and down the street. 2S AND 3S EVERYWHERE
START TO SPARKLE. And then a BUS TURNS THE CORNER...

-a No. 23.

WALTER (V.O.)
Was the number just a number, or was
it evil? Was Ned just a dog, or was
he truly 'The Guardian of the Dead'?
119.

Walter looks at Robin... at Agatha... at Ned... beside whom
now stands THE VISION OF SUICIDE GAL.

SUICIDE GAL
I guess he just didn't love me enough.

WALTER (V.0O.)
Finally, I understood. I had written
the rules. It was time for me to
play by them.

Walter turns to the now FAST-APPROACHING bus. Gazes at Agatha.
She locks eyes with him. He mouths:

WALTER
I'll never forget you.

He walks down the steps, continuing right off the curb. Brakes
SQUEAL and...

THE SCREEN TURNS RED. ODD...
»..it seems alive. Moving. Flowing.

WALTER (V.0O.)
You can call me Fingerling.

Walter lies on his back in the middle of the cobblestoned
road, staring at the BLOOD seeping from his head.

WALTER (V.O.)
It's not my real name, but comes
from a book I read as a child,
'Fingerling at the Zoo.’

EXT. GRAVEYARD - DAY

A large funeral crowd. No one we recognize. The name on the
NEW gravestone reads: "LAURA TOLLINS.”

WALTER {V.O.)
Paper flap long gone, it had a green,
hardback cover and mottled texture,
and was possibly my very first book.

We pull away and, CAMERA ABOUT KNEE-HIGH, weave across the
grounds, past the graves of SIRIUS LEARY... JESSICA FLINCH...

WALTER (V.O.)
Funny, I can't recall what it was
about, the only thing I remember is
the name. 'Fingerling.' I wished it
was mine.
120.
NOT FAR AWAY - AGATHA AND ROBIN
stand by a GRAVESTONE. It reads:
"WALTER PAUL SPARROW
FATHER OF THE YEAR
FOR EVERY YEAR WE KNEW HIM"

WALTER (V.0.)
Now it is.

A MAN walks up beside them. Looks at the gravestone.
WALTER (V.O.)
It wasn't the happiest of endings.
But justice. was served.
The man faces them. It's Kyle Flinch.

KYLE FLINCH
Thank you.

He walks away to an ELDERLY MAN AND WOMAN -- his parents.
Agatha takes Robin's hand. She turns to leave, sees:
NOT FAR AWAY - NED
sitting under a tree, watching them.
WALTER (V.O.)

While I don't particularly like the

choice I had to make...
Robin follows his mom's gaze. Ned looks him in the eye then

glances around the cemetery. Robin does the same. 2S AND 3S
ON_ GRAVES SUDDENLY...

...SPARKLE IN THE SUNLIGHT. And Robin is seeing them.

AGATHA
What is it?

Robin looks at his mom, He turns back to the graves.

WALTER (V.O.}
...I know I made the right one...

ALL THE NUMBERS FADE AWAY.

ROBIN
Nothing, mom. It's nothing.

Ned walks off.
121.

Agatha and Robin set off in the opposite direction to a car.
Isaac's car.

WALTER (V.0.)
..-and from where I am now, it makes
perfect sense.
We PULL UP, INTO THE SKY, until we are LOOKING DOWN ON THE
GRAVEYARD FROM A GREAT HEIGHT. Various locations STAND OUT:
the bookstore, Nathaniel's, the Sparrow home, Casanova's
Park, the Shell Hotel, police station, etc.

Weird. If you join the dots between all of them, you end up
with a number...

= FADE OUT.
The following TITLECARD appears:
"BE SURE YOUR SIN WILL FIND YOU OUT."
followed, a heartbeat later, by its source:
NUMBERS 32:23
THE NED.
