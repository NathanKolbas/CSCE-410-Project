            FADE UP



            EXT. SKY - NIGHT



            Travelling forward at a great speed at 10,000 feet up in the

            air, a full moon illuminates the starry sky above and clouds

            below.



            SUPERIMPOSE TITLE - LONDON FIELDS



            A British Airways airplane drops in altitude and skims along

            the top of the cloud cover.  The BA plane flies into and

            through the TITLE leaving a trail of clouds in its tailwind.



            INT. BRITISH AIRWAYS AIRPLANE - NIGHT



            A young English STEWARDESS leaves the cockpit and walks past

            an empty First Class, an empty Business Class and into

            Economy Class; empty save for one unhealthy looking American

            passenger SAMSON YOUNG.  He's in his thirties but looks over

            forty.  The stewardess approaches Sam stretched out, red-eye

            style over 4 seats.  She hands him vodka and tonic on the

            rocks.  He's drunk.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Excuse me miss?  Do you think you could

                      manage to find for me a valium and a cold

                      glass of water?



            She ignores his request and sits next to him.



                                STEWARDESS

                      Why are you here when nobody in their

                      right mind wants to come to Europe, and

                      especially not London.  Not now.



            She studies him.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      I am hoping to go to London and find

                      something to write.  I need to turn

                      around my failed literary career as a

                      barely known novelist - two novels no one

                      read.  And now, I find myself at what my

                      doctor regretfully describes as the very

                      end of my life.



                                STEWARDESS

                      You're not old.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      That is the crime of it.



            The stewardess is visibly disturbed by this.



            The stewardess lights a cigarette.  Sam notices, waits for an

            alarm to go off.



                                STEWARDESS

                      -turned the smoke detector off in economy

                      class.



            The fasten seat belts lights go on, along with the cabin

            lights.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Here, in all this, I ought to be able to

                      find a story to be my legacy, to survive

                      me.



            He empties the glass and hands it to her.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      May I have another please?



            The plane dips noticeably, descends.



            EXT. SKY - SAME



            The BA airplane pierces the clouds and descends at a fierce

            angle.



            INT. BAGGAGE CLAIM - 6:00AM



            Sam lifts his one large suit case onto a trolley, walks

            through a deserted customs and out the exit doors.



            INT. AIRPORT MAIN LOBBY - SAME



            Sam finds chaos at check in counters.  PASSENGERS force their

            way onto flights.



            EXT. BRITISH AIRWAYS TERMINAL - SAME



            A sign held by Radio Cab DRIVER KEITH TALENT says 'Samson

            Young'.  Keith's beautiful boyish face is puffy, eyes blood

            shot, his crowning glory, his hair, is thick & smooth. He's

            wearing skin tight flares and a red wet-look coat, dressed

            like a porno star. Sam whipped by wind gives Keith his

            suitcase.  On the street and on the sidewalk, there are no

            cars, and no people.  An unusually low red sun, lights the

            area burning it out.



                                SAMSON YOUNG (V.O.)

                      I didn't exactly have much to lose.

                      Looking back on my arrival now, I am

                      thankful for the murder story I was about

                      to receive.



                                                            CUT TO BLACK



            SUPERIMPOSE OVER BLACK THE HEADING:  THE MURDER STORY



            INT. TAXI - MORNING



            54.50 on the blatting meter.  KEITH TALENT at the wheel.



                                SAMSON YOUNG (V.O.)

                      It was all so perfectly done that I can't

                      tell what was planned or what was fate.

                      Keith Talent was sent by Mark Asprey to

                      pick me up at the airport.  It's the sort

                      of detail that haunts me to my grave...



            Samson Young passed out on the back seat of the Ford

            Cavalier.



                                                            CUT TO BLACK



            Sam wakes up as they approach Slough.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Slough!  Listen.  I know my way around.

                      I'm not over here to see Harrod's, and

                      Buckingham Palace, and Stratford-on-Avon.

                      Slough?  Come on.  If this is a kidnap or

                      a murder then we'll discuss it.  If not,

                      take me to London for the amount we

                      agreed.



            Slowly, Keith pulls over.  Turns, faces Sam.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      What it is is.  What it is is- okay.  I

                      seen you was asleep.  I thought "He's

                      asleep.  Looks as though he could use it.

                      I know.  I'll pop in on me mum."

                      Disregard the meter.  Don't mind do you

                      pal?



            He points to a line of pebbledash semis on an estate.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      She's sick like.  Won't be five minutes,

                      Okay?



            Over the stereo a tape plays a dart competition with an

            ANNOUNCER raving on as darts make contact with a dart board,

            thud after thud, announcing score after score.



                                KEITH  TALENT

                      Darts.  I'd ask you in but- me old mum.

                      Here.  Read this.



            He hands Sam a four-page brochure.  C.U. on the back of the

            brochure, a crudely superimposed black & white photograph of

            the driver, 'Keith Talent.'  It says:  services, *Darts

            lessons given.



            Sam watches Keith jump out of the car and dash towards a

            house.  The door of the house is opened by a GIRL in tiny

            underwear with thick calves.



            EXT. MARK ASPREY HOUSE STREET - LATER



            Keith lifts Sam's suitcase from out of the trunk. Sam is

            impressed by the massive ecclesiastical style house.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      It's a church...



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      It used to be a rectory or vicarage or

                      something.

                             (Pointing to a panel above

                              the door)

                      Anno Domini.  1876.



            O.S. low frequency jet planes rip over the rooftops.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Jesus.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      What's all that about?



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Cloaked in secrecy innit.  All veiled in

                      secrecy as such.



            Sam holds back.  Keith can tell he's got his reasons.



            INT. MARK ASPREY'S HOUSE - NEXT



            Keith glances around the opulent place with a looter's eye.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Who owns this gaff then?



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Mark Asprey?  He's a writer.  Like

                      myself.  But he's written mostly for

                      theatre & television.  I only write

                      unpopular novels.  I can tell you now

                      who's gotten the better end of this deal.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      TV?  I'm in TV too.  Yeah, well, I'm due

                      to appear on TV myself.  Hopefully in a

                      month.  Darts.  Championship.



            Keith lights a cigarette, walks from livingroom to bedroom.



            INT. MARK ASPREY'S BEDROOM - SAME



            More like a trophy room exploiting Mark Asprey's female

            conquests.  Mirrors cover the walls, ceiling and the bed's

            headboard.  Signed photographs- the erotic prints of many

            FEMALES hang on the walls.  Sam smirks.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Why didn't he just nail their G-strings

                      to the walls.



            From off a table, Keith steals a crystal ball award.  C.U. on

            the award's glass surface engraved 'For Intellectual

            Excellence.  Keith follows Sam into the next room.



            INT. MARK ASPREY'S OFFICE LIBRARY - SAME



            Surrounded by Tonis, Guggies, honorary degrees, gowns from

            Oxford, Cambridge & Trinity College, Sam examines the Mark

            Asprey awards with some awe.  Keith picks up in his hand a

            small ribboned pin from Cambridge University.  C.U. it says -

            'For Literary Achievement.'



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Important writing prizes innit.



            Keith slips this momento from Cambridge University into his

            pocket.



            INT. MARK ASPREY'S LIVING ROOM - LATER



            Keith's made himself at home.  Sam analyses Keith as they

            drink beers.



            INT. THE SCREW FACTORY - NIGHT



            The plant robbery off M4 near Bristol.  CHICK PURCHASE with

            his HENCHMEN, DON PLEAT and Keith Talent are in the cashier's

            office of a screw factory.  In a horrific display of

            violence; Keith can't move, his hand frozen over an ASIAN

            MAN, unable to club him to his knees.



            Keith looks at Chick Purchase crippling a uniformed GUARD,

            and Don Pleat restraining another GUARD.  Chick finishes and

            goes over to Keith, pointing Keith out to Don Pleat.



                                CHICK PURCHASES

                      He doesn't have the talent this Keith

                      Talent.



                                CHICK PURCHASE & DON PLEAT

                             (in unison)

                      Do it.  Do it.



            Keith can't cripple him.  Even though it would make the guard

            open the safe.  Keith is frozen, shaking feebly.  Keith

            struggles to speak to the guard by the safe.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      O-p-en-it.  Open it.  Open it.



            Keith walks away from the guard by the safe and retreats into

            a corner.  Keith shrinks as Chick approaches to threaten him.



                                CHICK PURCHASE

                      Keith you're a bad guy... but not the

                      worst, not the very worst ever.  There

                      are worse guys.  But not murder?  Not

                      yet, Keith, right?  Well you just leave

                      it to me.



            Chick Purchase slaps Keith and turns away.  Then seamlessly

            he slugs the second guard with an amazingly destructive right

            hook to his eye.



            Don Pleat vaults over the counter, rifle butts the Asian Man

            in the forehead.  Crack.  There's blood pouring from his

            cracked skull spraying out as he falls to the floor dead.



            A puddle of blood forms around him darkening his pale cotton

            shirt.



            INT. MARK ASPREY'S LIVING ROOM - LATER



            Sam, greatly disturbed and greatly impressed, by what Keith

            didn't do at the robbery.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      I'm glad violent crime didn't agree with

                      you.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Not as such.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Or not as yet?



            Keith finishes his beer.  Getting up Keith gets suspicious.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      You know I've never met a writer before.

                      Do you get everyone to talk?  I bet you

                      do.  What are you writing about now?



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      I don't know.  I'm looking.  Thinking.



                                KEITH TALENT

                             (joking)

                      I'm warning you, don't write about me.

                      Let's go to the pub. I could do with

                      another.



                                                            CUT TO BLACK



            SUPERIMPOSE OVER BLACK THE HEADING:  THE MURDEREE



            EXT. FUNERAL GOLDERS GREEN CEMETERY - PRESENT DAY



            NICOLA SIX, a brown-haired beauty of thirty-four.  She's what

            happens when English blood is tinged with some hot foreign

            element.  Dressed for death with a veil over her magnificent

            face; she observes the coffin being lowered into the cemetery

            plot.



            The MOURNERS all grieve.  Overhead a thunder clap booms

            menacingly loud.



            Nicola looks up at the sky away from the funeral's

            proceedings.



            The mourners walk away from the burial site.  She is left

            there alone.  A heavy blackbird flies low over her head.  A

            pleasant looking MAN approaches her.



                                MAN

                      May I help?  Do you need a lift

                      somewhere?



                                NICOLA SIX

                      I hadn't actually thought of it.  I could

                      use a lift.  Yes.  If you don't mind.



            The man smiles.  Strange older MOURNERS look back at Nicola

            as he guides her to his car in the parking lot.



            INT. OLD DAIMLER LIMOUSINE ON PORTOBELLO ROAD - SHORT TIME

            LATER



            E.C.U. on Nicola's eyelashes blinking.  Her red varnished

            fingertips touch her lips beneath her veil.  Nicola and the

            man from the funeral sit in the Daimler's front seats, with

            two extremely wrinkled OLD LADY RELATIVES in the back.



            Nicola, stunned, looks out at a pub, The Black Cross.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      That's it there, please.  That's the

                      place I've been looking for.  I'm

                      supposed to be there.



            The car closes in on the old pub.



            EXT. CAR - SAME



            Overhead, clouds thunder ready to drop its plunger, as Nicola

            steps out of the car.  She readjusts her veil.  She walks up

            to the pub.  The pub door has a painted sign saying, "TV,

            DARTS AND PINBALL."  Above the door an old carved pub sign

            with a heraldic coat of arms reads 'The Black Cross.'



                                NICOLA SIX

                             (to herself)

                      This is the place.



                                                            CUT TO BLACK



            SUPERIMPOSE OVER BLACK THE HEADING: THE MURDERER



            INT. BLACK CROSS - SAME



            Nicola walks straight up to the bar amidst groans and

            whispers, and lifts her veil with both hands, exposing those

            eyes.  Her POV as she sees Keith.  She spots him first.



            Keith sees her.  The canned rock song hits a scratch and

            skips a beat.  Keith Talent drops his dart.  It lands on his

            left foot, plunging like a missile into his cheap canvas

            shoe.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Fuck.



            C.U. on Keith's hand pulling the dart out of his shoe.  A

            drop of blood gathers on the white canvas shoe.



            Nicola's POV SWISH PANS to Samson Young seated at a table.



                                SAMSON YOUNG (V.O.)

                      Keith was the key to the Black Cross Pub.

                      He introduced me around so that by the

                      time our murderee walked in there on that

                      fateful day in October, I was in with all

                      the players.  All of them.



            SWISH PAN from Samson Young to GUY CLINCH, tall, handsome, a

            flourish of boyish hair, raincoat, an aristocrat, over thirty

            five.  Guy is depressed, self-effacing, but somehow he is too

            introverted to be sexy.



            Both men, Sam and Guy, seated together, notice Nicola Six

            immediately.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      Who's that?



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      I wish I knew.



            Nicola walks up to the bar and speaks to the BARMAN:



                                NICOLA SIX

                      May I have a pack of Gauloise please?



                                GODFREY (BARMAN)

                      No danger there.  We don't sell French

                      fags here, darling.  No way.  Carlyle!



            Keith exchanges glances with his motley, rag-tag entourage-

            DEAN, NORVIS, THELONIUS (the pimp), SHAKESPEARE, BID DREAD,

            GODFREY the barman, FUCKER BURKE,  MAJEET, ZBIGNIEW and his

            dog CLIVE.  Keith, the superstar of the pub, pouches his

            darts and limps over to the bar- moving in on Nicola Six.

            Guy watches Keith in wonder.



            The little black boy, CARLYLE, eagerly receives a crumpled

            fiver.



                                GODFREY

                      Get the lady her French fags.  Go on,

                      will ya.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Bereavement, innit.  Still.  God?  Get

                      her a brandy.  She needs it!  What's your

                      name, sweetheart?



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Nicola Six.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Sex!



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Actually it's Six.  S-I-X.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Seeks!  Relax, Nicky.  We get all sorts

                      in here.  (Calling out to Guy)  Hey,

                      Cock!  Dead posh!  Guy!  High society,

                      innit.  Come and be introduced.



            Guy and Sam both stand up together.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      We'll have to thank Keith for this one

                      someday.



            Sam follows Guy towards the bar.



            INT. BLACK CROSS - SAME



            Guy Clinch extends his hand towards her black glove bowing

            slightly.  Sam slides into a stool behind Guy observing

            Nicola from up close.



            It's a four shot with Sam behind Guy on Nicola's left and

            Keith on her right.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      How do you do?



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Oooh!  (In a ridiculous fake aristocratic

                      accent)  How do you do?



            Carlyle comes running back to the bar with the cigarettes.



            Nicola removes her glove exposing five bitten fingernails.

            She opens the pack of cigarettes.  Places the funeral program

            on the bar - a white card with a gold embossed cross above a

            photo.  The photo of a handsome MAN leaning against a

            convertable MG sportscar.



            She puts a cigarette between her lips.  Keith lights her

            cigarette.



            Nicola's POV E.C.U. of the flame igniting, her cigarette tip.

            With her, the lighter's flame is actually pulled towards her

            as she sucks it in.



            Effortlessly she exhales a smoke ring.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      You must let me pay for these.



            Keith pokes his finger into her smoke ring, it crawls over

            his knuckles in a wave.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      All taken care of.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      I suppose, I suppose this is by way of

                      there having been a wake.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Weren't family?



                                NICOLA SIX

                             (lying)

                      Just a man I used to work for.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Still.  Does you credit.  Show respect.

                      Even if it's just some old geezer.  Comes

                      to us all as such.  The Great Leveller

                      innit.



            Sam leans in to get a look at the dead man's photo.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                             (to Nicola)

                      May I have a look?



            Nicola nods her consent.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      He doesn't seem to be an "old geezer"

                      does he?



                                GUY CLINCH

                      I must say your veil is very becoming on

                      you.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      One never gets enough opportunity to wear

                      one.  I'd like to be buried in a veil.



            Sam is taken in by what she said, intrigued by the very

            mention of her burial.



            Nicola touches her hand to her forehead, unsteady.



            Nicola's POV in SLOW-MOTION PAN ACROSS the men as she looks

            at Keith then Carlyle, Sam, then finally to Guy.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Oh my, I just had a deja vu.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      Of what?



                                NICOLA SIX

                             (to Guy)

                      Oh uh, of you.

                             (to Keith)

                      And you.

                             (to Sam)

                      And everyone actually.

                             (she stands up to go)

                      Thank you.  You've been very kind.



            Keith & Guy watch her go.  Tight Skirt.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      ...Extraordinary woman.



                                KEITH TALENT

                             (Wiping his mouth, leaving)

                      Yeah, she'll do.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      You're not-



            Keith turns and looks at Guy's hand gripping his forearm.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      Come on, Keith.  She's just been to a

                      funeral.  A girl like that.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      A girl like what?  She's dreaming of it,

                      begging for it.  Praying for it.  She's a

                      bit thin to be my type.



            Angle on her beautiful body wriggling away on high heels.



                                KEITH  TALENT

                      Maybe her bum is fatter than it looks.

                      The thinner birds can make up for it in

                      the crib.



            Nicola pushes her way out the pub doors.  Above the door a

            sign, "NO FUCKING SWEARING".



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Women always want it after weddings and

                      funerals.  Life goes on innit.  Life is

                      fucking great.



            Keith rushes out after her.  Guy's grip on Keith slackens and

            drops.  Guy follows.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Guy- Where are you going?



                                GUY CLINCH

                      Same place Keith is going.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      I don't recommend it.



            Guy looks back at Sam unable to explain or stop himself.



            EXT. PORTOBELLO ROAD - SAME



            Keith trails Nicola through the stall of the barrowed street.

            She touches a stuffed leopard's head, a stuffed monkey's

            hand.  She looks into a cracked mirror, multiplying her face

            many times over.  She flees.  Keith chases her, dodging the

            CROWD.



            Keith at the flower stall grabs a bunch of dark maroon

            dahlias, nods at the OWNER, and dashes for Nicola.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      A time like this.  Discover the language

                      of flowers, and let their soothing

                      words...

                             (lost)

                      Soothe away all your cares like.

                             (He gives the flowers to her)

                      On me.  You heading on down this way?  Or

                      I got the Cavalier around the corner.



            Without touching her, his hand urges her down the street.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      I see a girl like you.  Bit of a beauty.

                      Head in the clouds as such.  You said you

                      got your own place.



            She nods and smiles.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Now. Me?  I'm Handy Andy.  Mr. Fixit

                      innit.  You know the fuse's gone.  The

                      boiler's creating or the bell don't work.

                      You need somebody with a few connections.

                             (In a posher voice)

                      These days, you just can't get decent

                      help when you need it.  I don't know what

                      the country's coming to.  I don't.



            As they continue walking, she removes her hat.  Her hair is

            pulled up into a chignon, held in place by a clip, which she

            removes.  Her hair falls with a shake.



            Her hands pull on her jacket exposing her breasts.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Anything you want, darling.  Anything at

                      all.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Well, as a matter of fact, there are one

                      or two things that certainly need looking

                      at.  Like the vacuum cleaner.  It's very

                      good of you.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      What's your phone number, Nick?



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Have you got a pen?



                                KEITH TALENT

                      No need.  Got this head for figures.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      0207-221-7711.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Sweet.



            Nicola stops at her dead-end street talking to Keith.  Angle

            on Guy Clinch cowering just out of sight.



            INT. MARK ASPREY'S OFFICE LIBRARY - SAME DAY - DUSK



            Sam lays out his own two publications on the leather-topped

            desk, next to his portable.  "On the Grapevine" and "Memoirs

            of a Listener," by Samson Young.  He grimaces noticeably as

            he examines his books in his hands.  He sits back in his

            chair.  He takes out a paper and puts it in the typewriter.

            He stares at it.  Drinks some vodka.  Pained he can't think

            up a thing to write.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      It hurts.  I can't do it.  I can't write.

                      I can't make anything up.



            Samson Young looks through the bay windows on the square

            below and sees her - Nicola Six, still dressed in her funeral

            attire as before; the dress, the hat, the veil.  In her black

            gloved hands she holds something solid, ribboned in red,

            clutched close like a child.



            EXT. THE SQUARE - SAME



            She stops at the garbage containers near the square, looks up

            at the window.  Her POV as rays of sun light catch the glass

            and obliterates any chance of her getting a clearer view of

            Sam.



            She drops her burden in the trash, moves off in a hurry.



            INT. MARK ASPREY'S OFFICE LIBRARY - SAME



            Sam eyes his clock ticking over.  Rectory bells ring in the

            hour.



            EXT. THE SQUARE - NEXT



            Sam sits on the bench, opens the red ribbon's knot, unwraps

            her set of diaries.  C.U. on front page which has Nicola

            Six's name, address and phone number written in.



            Sam looks up and sees Nicola Six, twenty meters away staring.

            He mimes a gesture to return it to her.  She walks off fast,

            turns the corner, goes out of sight.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      What kind of person throws away their own

                      diaries?



            Shamelessly, he thumbs through the diaries.



            INT. MARK ASPREY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT



            Sam, as seen in bed on the ceiling mirror, the mirror on the

            headboard, and the mirror on the facing wall. He fondles her

            last page of her diary.



            C.U. on diary page date.  October 6th, 2001.



            C.U. on digital watch.  10/6/2001, 9:02PM.



            C.U. on I've found him.  On the Portobello Road, in a place

            called the Black Cross, I found him today.  My murderer.



            He reads aloud out of her diary.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Right from the start I knew two strange

                      things.



            INT.  BLACK CROSS FLASH BACK - EARLIER TODAY



            Eerie, slow motion sequence looking down on the players -

            Nicola, Keith, Guy, and Sam is cut half out of frame.



                                SAMSON YOUNG (V.O.)

                      The first strange thing is that I'd be

                      killed.  And the second strange thing is

                      that I shouldn't tell anyone about the

                      first strange thing.



            INT.  MARK ASPREY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT



            Sam takes a pause, turns back to the front page of her diary,

            reads more.



            E.C.U. on the bold hand written words at the top of the page

            of her diary - I live every day of my life with this

            premonition in my head.



            EXT. LONDON STREET - NIGHT



            Nicola's premonition:  The heavy black car is waiting.  A

            different black car drives away.  The murderee, Nicola Six,

            walks down the street.  She shows little emotion.



            The black car's lights turn on.  Slowly, the car lumbers

            toward her.  It stops, idles, as the passenger door swings

            open.  All voices are altered; seeming other-worldly, as in a

            dream, unrecognizable.



                                DRIVER

                      Get in.



                                SAMSON YOUNG (V.O.)

                      She could never quite see the face of the

                      driver, her murderer.



            His face barred in darkness.  She sees a car tool (tire iron)

            ready on his lap.  She leans forward in intense recognition.



                                MURDERER

                      Get in.



            And in she climbs.



                                SAMSON YOUNG (V.O.)

                      Her murder has a date, even a time:  some

                      minutes before midnight on her thirty

                      fifth birthday. But what's missing is the

                      how and who part of the premonition, and

                      if she knows that, then she could have

                      control over her own murder. Full

                      control.



            The black car drives away.  The image fades away as Nicola

            looks back out of the rear window.


INT. MARK ASPREY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT



            Sam winces, takes a pause before he turns back the pages of

            her diary.  Stops.  Reads it.



            INT. FLASHBACK NICOLA'S CHILDHOOD BEDROOM 1976 - NIGHT



            Nicola, age 10, tosses and turns in bed, experiences a

            nightmarish premonition.



                                SAMSON YOUNG (V.O.)

                      Nicola's gift, her second sight told her

                      about the death of her parents.



            Her mother comes in and wakes Nicola.  Her face is covered in

            sweat.  She cries.



                                SAMSON YOUNG (V.O.)

                      She couldn't help it from happening or

                      get it to happen later or earlier.

                      She just had the ability to know that

                      they were going to die and the

                      helplessness that goes along with it.

                      She wasn't able to control it.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Don't go.  Don't fly on the plane.

                      Please don't fly.



            Her mother looks back at her father standing in the doorway.



                                MOTHER

                      We're not going anywhere, sweetie.  We're

                      not flying on the airplane.  We love you.

                      It was a bad dream.



                                SAMSON YOUNG (V.O.)

                      She knew about her parents - She's angry

                      because she couldn't change any of it.



            She holds her mother and dries her tears.



            INT. VIP LOUNGE AIRPORT 1986 - NIGHT



            Nicola, age 18, with a schoolgirl's looks, longer hair, in

            the VIP lounge with fifty PEOPLE in distress.



            A television news bulletin shows live footage of the

            scattered plane wreckage, body bags lined up on the French

            airfield.



                                SAMSON YOUNG (V.O.)

                      It's not as though she sat about for ten

                      years waiting for her Mother and Father's

                      plane to crash; it's just that she did

                      expect it to crash and burn exactly the

                      way it did.  She just didn't know when or

                      where it was going to happen.



            A handsome STEWARD presses a full glass of brandy into her

            hand as she talks to him.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      They both died, anyway, together, as I

                      had always known they would.



            The surviving PILOT, covered in soot, facial bruises, looks

            Nicola over from head to toe.



            INT. MARK ASPREY'S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT



            Sam sits up in bed with Nicola's diaries.



                                SAM

                      Every premonition she had was always

                      missing a valuable piece of information.

                      Always something was withheld which drove

                      her crazy.



            Sam reaches over and takes a pill from a bottle of

            prescription medicine on his end table.  Unfortunately he

            drinks it down with a vodka.  His face is greasy and sweaty.



            He lowers the light in the room.  Returns to Nicola's diary

            in his hands and resumes reading.  Uncomfortable, he adjusts

            his position in the bed.



            Angle on the worn out pages of her diary, all those years

            recorded by her hand.  C.U. on Nicola's words - No one will

            ever love me enough.



            INT. PILOT'S HOME - THAT NIGHT



            Nicola has acrobatic sex with the unforgivable plane crash

            pilot.  He's wearing a blindfold.  His gold winged captain's

            hat flung over the bedpost along with his ornate uniform.



            INT. MARK ASPREY'S BEDROOM - EARLY DAWN



            Sam closes the diary and turns out the last of the lights.

            He lowers himself down the bed and rests his head on the

            pillow.  He's too stimulated by the diaries to sleep.  He

            takes a last look over at the diaries each one open beside

            him on the bed. He is amazed, they open up a whole new world

            for him.



            EXT. NICOLA'S DEAD-END STREET - THAT MORNING



            Clutching the diaries, Sam faces Nicola Six's apartment

            townhouse door.  His hair is wet and slicked back from having

            just showered.



            He presses the buzzer marked number '6' on Nicola's apartment

            building intercom.  Beside the buzzer it says her name 'SIX.'

            Sam waits a beat too much.



                                NICOLA SIX (O.S.)

                      Yes, hello?



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      My name is Samson Young.  Hello.  We met

                      in the pub, remember, the Black Cross?

                      And later that day we saw each other on

                      the street?  I have some things of yours

                      I would like to return to you.



                                NICOLA SIX (O.S.)

                      I was expecting you...I just don't want

                      them.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Yes you do.



                                NICOLA SIX (O.S.)

                      No, I don't.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Okay.  Then I'll try the police.  They

                      have an intrinsic interest in murder

                      mysteries.



                                NICOLA SIX (O.S.)

                      Christ, another literalist.  Look. Come

                      back in an hour.  It's all happening

                      rather fast for me.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      There's no need for you to dress up for

                      me.  I'm not a contender in all this.

                      I'm-disinterested.  But, technically

                      speaking, I am also, I suppose, an

                      accessory before the fact.  I don't care

                      how you look...  I'm not here to stop

                      you.



            She hangs up.  A long silence.  The buzzer sounds.



            INT. NICOLA SIX'S APARTMENT - LATER



            Sam sits in a wicker chair.



            Nicola sits opposite Sam in a soiled white dressing-gown,

            hair aslant over her unpainted face.  He can't take his eyes

            off of her.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      You look like you've just fucked fifteen

                      guys.



            No answer.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Sorry. I, ugh...



                                NICOLA SIX

                      It's been a big day for me too.



            She opens a bottle of champagne.  Pop.  Pours into a glass

            with lipstick markings.  She won't look at Sam.  He slides

            the diaries towards her, across the coffee table.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      You read everything.  Everything?



            She blushes.  Arranges her dressing-gown.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      So you know all about my sexual...



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      You clearly associate sex with death.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      I always have. I know it.  I've been

                      analyzed, for years.  For me you're just

                      an unwelcome complication.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Maybe not.  Maybe I'll help simplify.

                      I'm intrigued by what you say about the

                      premonition of your own murder...



            Sam shifts nervously, gaining a fierceness to his thoughts.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Are you sure you're going to be murdered?



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Yes.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      What's the murder weapon?



                                NICOLA SIX

                      A car tool.  A car jack.



            He fixes it in his mind.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      I see.  Just as you wrote about it in

                      your diaries?



                                NICOLA SIX

                      I don't exaggerate in my diaries.  Would

                      a gun have impressed you more?



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      No.



                                NICOLA SIX

                             (smiling)

                      I see.  It's the kind of detail you can

                      live with.



            He studies her.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Who is going to murder you?



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Who do you want it to be?



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Let's get this straight.  I don't want it

                      to be anyone.  I don't want it to happen.

                      But you do.  It sounds like you've got it

                      under control.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      That's my intention.  I just want it to

                      be the way I want it.  I have to control

                      it.



            Sam takes it in.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      I'm a writer.  I'm a novelist.



            This throws her off.  Nicola looks at him for a beat.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Oh, I see.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Nicola, let me write it.  All of it.



            Nervously, she barely smiles.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      I should be there watching.  A witness.

                      Will you let me do that?



                                NICOLA SIX

                      You know every woman wants to be the

                      bitch in the book.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      And every writer wants to write about a

                      bitch's murder.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      I've always felt like a story.



            Nicola looks away coyly.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      I can't stop it from happening. So I

                      might as well enjoy it. Don't you think?



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      I'm trying not to think.  I'll leave all

                      that creative stuff to you.  Can I call

                      you tomorrow?



            She nods.



            Muted, Nicola talks on, gives a guided tour of the apartment

            holding her diaries across her chest.  Keith looks at her bum

            as she moves it from room to room.  The apartment is larger

            than you think, with an unused guest bedroom and a den. In

            the den, angle on a MUTED TV turned onto a news program

            broadcasting the negotiations between the world's LEADERS

            around a large table each with microphones.



            She leads him to the front door where she gives him back her

            diaries.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      When is your thirty-fifth birthday?



            It's awkward.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      In your diary, you wrote that your thirty

                      fifth birthday is the day that you will

                      be killed.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      November 5th, 2001.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Twenty-one days from today, Guy Fawkes

                      Day, and the day of the total eclipse of

                      the Sun.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      That's correct.  Very good.



            She and Sam look at each other for several seconds.  Sam

            looks pale, his eyes are red.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      But-  You're-



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Don't say it!  Even if you know it.

                      Please don't say it.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      My God, you really are.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Can you tell?



            Sam looks at her helplessly.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      We have something in common after all.



            Their eyes widen as they acknowledge this fact.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      It must be a comfort knowing which day

                      you'll be going.



            Overwhelmingly he studies her as she looks at him intently.



                                SAMSON YOUNG (V.O.)

                      She knew about herself. And she knew

                      about me; that my life would be so soon

                      over.



            O.S. her buzzer sounds.



                                KEITH TALENT (O.S.)

                      Nicky?  Keith.



            Sam frowns.  Unhappy and jealous to lose her to Keith.

            Nicola presses the button and lets Keith into the apartment

            building.



            INT. NICOLA SIX'S STAIRWAY - SAME



            Keith's face leans in and stops to inspect a neighbour's door

            lock and hold someone's brown envelope up to the light on his

            way upstairs.



            INT. NICOLA SIX'S APARTMENT - SAME



            Keith sniffs entering the sitting room in his Cuban heels and

            flares.  His darts finger fluttering about him.  Sam stands

            to one side.  Keith clocks Sam's presence in the other room.



            Keith looks around at the emerald ring on her hand, the

            tapestry on the wall, horse and lion paintings, tv and

            stereo.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Come on in.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Champagne.  Cheers.  Jesus.  Prestigious.



            Sam watches them interact, impressed by her.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      ...Do you want a drink or something?



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Work before pleasure, love.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      You're quite drunk already, aren't you,

                      Keith.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Little celebration.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      I suppose we might as well get started.



            She leads him into the kitchen.  He follows her backside,

            wiggling his fingers near it.  Sam sees this.  Keith decides

            not to ram his hand up her dress.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Nicola, I'll be going now.  Thank you.



            Sam slips out of the apartment.  He glances back at Nicola as

            she leads Keith into the kitchen.



            INT.  KITCHEN - NEXT



            The coffee grinder sits in a puddle of coffee.



            She gives him a screwdriver.  He flirts, pours it on, tries

            to be silly.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      It's coming.  It's coming.  Coming...



            Applying the tool, the blade skids into Keith's thumb.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      FUCK!



            Drops everything.



                                KEITH  TALENT

                      M'darts thumb.  It's crucial to mastering

                      the game.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Oh I'm sure you'll master the game Keith.

                      But you're completely hopeless with this

                      sort of thing.  Or are you just drunk?



            She bends over to a drawer exposing her garters as she finds

            a plaster band-aid for his wound.  She approaches his gently

            quivering thumb, in C.U.  Her lips near his thumb in such an

            obvious gesture.  She wraps the band-aid around the cut.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Seen up close, flesh looks genital.

                      Don't you think Keith?



            Their hands drop out of frame.



                                NICOLA SIX

                             (Coming closer)

                      I'd better give you a deposit.



            His Cuban heels edge backwards towards the door.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Oh, the man in the Black Cross.  Guy.

                      Clinch.



            She loads Keith up, fills both his arms with appliances.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Yeah.  Guy,



                                NICOLA SIX

                      He's someone - he's someone of

                      importance, isn't he, Keith.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Definitely.  He works in the city.  He's

                      titled.  I seen it on his checkbook.  The

                      Honourable, innit.



            She steps forward rolling two hundred pound notes together.

            Places it in his mouth.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Try not to drop everything.  Is he rich?



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Definitely.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Good.  There's a thing you and I might do

                      together.  A money thing.  You need money

                      don't you Keith?



                                KEITH  TALENT

                      More than you'll ever know.



            She studies his needy face, his long lashes, moist lips.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      I thought so.  Have Guy call me.  Will

                      you do that?  Soon?



                                KEITH TALENT

                      I've been to his house.  Could go by

                      again for a drink.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Good.  After all, why should he have all

                      the money?  Oh, there's just one other

                      thing.  My name is Nicola.  Not Nicky or

                      Nick.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Right.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Say it.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Nicola.



            She places a finger on his black fishnet shirt.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      This sort of stuff.  It should be on my

                      legs.  Not on your chest.  Goodbye,

                      Keith.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Yeah cheers.



            He backs outside onto the stairway.  She closes the door

            sipping champagne.  O.S. he bangs his way noisily stepping

            down the stairs.



            EXT. LANSDOWNE CRESCENT HOUSE - LATER - SUNSET



            Travel along from Keith's Cavalier parked in front of the

            Clinch house with Nicola's appliances, to the sidewalk, up

            over a wall, to a masterpiece of a large white Regency house.

            The trees shake in violent winds, with low hanging clouds.



            INT. CLINCH HOUSE - MARMADUKE'S HALLWAY - SAME



            Outside the child's so-called room, Guy and Keith look

            through the door's square window.  Keith right there by Guy's

            side.  Keith, still wearing his black fishnet shirt, dressed

            as he was earlier today, at Nicola's.



            Through the window they see Guy's super-hyperactive three

            year-old son MARMADUKE shoot out of bed screaming, attacking

            the two large female NURSES with all he's got.  The room is

            white with padded floor, walls and ceiling.



            HOPE CLINCH, Guy's smart, calm, blonde American wife, joins

            them wearing a housecoat.  Keith clocks her ten carat diamond

            wedding ring, expensive slippers.



                                HOPE CLINCH

                             (American southern drawl)

                      Guy?



                                GUY CLINCH

                      Yes?



                                HOPE CLINCH

                      Can you see to Marmaduke?  I just can't.



            Calmly, Guy turns the door handle, opens the door.



            INT. MARMADUKE'S PADDED ROOM - SAME



            Guy enters the room.  Keith is beside himself enjoying the

            kid.  The two nurses hold Marmaduke's hands and feet as he

            writhes like one possessed.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      Hello, Man-Cub.



            Marmaduke frees himself and pokes Guy in the eye.  Guy holds

            his eye groaning.



            Marmaduke likes Keith and smiles at him.  Keith is full of

            admiration.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Lovely son.  Good boy.  Great son.



            Keith uses his bandaged finger to pat Marmaduke on the cheek.



            INT.  CLINCH HOUSE DRAWING ROOM - NEXT



            Guy leads Keith into the drawing room.  Guy pours Keith a

            brandy.  Hands it to him.



            Keith surveys the valuables in the room.  Keith's POV moves

            like the second hand of a clock around the room.  Tick - the

            crystal chandelier, Tock - the antique oil painting, Tick -

            the Grecian sculpture, Tock - the gold Louis XIV clock as it

            hits the eighth hour.



            Keith raises his glass for a refill.  Guy fills it up.  Old

            bells chime eight times, ending Keith's evaluations.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      Cut your finger?



                                KEITH TALENT

                      M'darts finger.  Happened before I got

                      here.  At Nicola Six's.  You know that

                      skirt who was in the Black Cross?

                      Nicola?  Well, you know what I'm like.

                      You know.  I thought she might want

                      seeing to.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      The flat?



                                KEITH TALENT

                      No.  Her.



            Keith stretches out his long legs, adjusts his jeans.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      How do you mean?



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Christ.



                                GUY CLINCH

                             (nauseously)

                      And?



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Well it's hard to tell, you  know, with

                      some birds.  She's funny.  Bit foreign.

                      An enigma innit - you know the type.

                      Half the time she's coming on dead tasty.

                      And I mean sorely in need of it.  And

                      then, you know, suddenly it's Lady Muck.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      So- Nothing happened.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Nah.  Fuck all, really.  And, I'm taking

                      my leave and, as I say, she asks about

                      you.  Wants you to phone her like.  Says

                      she requires your help.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      What about?



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Don't ask me, mate.  Maybe she likes her

                      own sort.  I mean I'm nothing, am I.  I'm

                      just a cunt.



            The door opens and Hope appears, holding Marmaduke like a

            parcel of plutonium, as he screams and kicks.  Keith steals a

            gold bird ornament, slips it into his pocket.



                                HOPE CLINCH

                      I'm going to bed.  Kenneth, would you put

                      that cigarette out please?  If you use

                      the kitchen I want everything cleared

                      away.  Without trace.



            Keith draws on his cigarette, one hand cupped under the long

            coal.  Guy searches for an ashtray.  Hope watches them.



            Guy finds an ashtray.  Keith's cigarette ash falls onto his

            hand.  Guy gives him the ashtray.  Keith drops his ash into

            it.  Hope leaves.



            C.U. on Keith trying to be subtle, leaning into Guy, in a

            whisper.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      On the whole I find posh skirt shockingly

                      arrogant in bed, always wanting to get on

                      top and other rubbish.  You call her.

                      Nicola Six.  Do it.



            The emotion in Guy's face builds and builds.



            EXT. NOTTING HILL PAY PHONE - SAME NIGHT - NEXT



            Guy bursts forward running, no hat, no umbrella.  He runs

            through the rain and puddles, past a BAG LADY, up to the red

            enclosed phone booth.  He scurries into the phone booth, puts

            a 50p coin into the phone box, dials.  O.S. it rings once.



            SPLIT SCREEN between Guy dripping wet in the phone booth on

            the left, and Nicola in her living room on the right.  As the

            call progresses the SPLIT SCREEN does not stay split equally

            on the right and left screen.  It creeps slowly leftward 'til

            the end of the telephone call, when Nicola's side takes over

            the frame completely.



            INT. NICOLA'S APARTMENT - SAME



            Balancing the phone on her shoulder, Nicola tears up her

            bills one after the other.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Hello.



            E.C.U. on the bills tearing - the electricity bill, the phone

            bill, the water bill-



            EXT. NOTTING HILL PAY PHONE - SAME



            C.U. on Guy's face listening with high hopes.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      Is this Nicola Six?



                                NICOLA SIX (O.S.)

                      Yes.



            Guy melts.



            INT. NICOLA'S - SAME



            She stops tearing and listens intently.  After a long pause -



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Yes.  That would be fine...  12:30.  Yes.

                      Good night.



            She hangs up the phone.  SPLIT SCREEN ends, exposing Sam as

            he walks into the room at the far right of frame.  Sam

            watches her every move.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      That was Guy.  We're meeting.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Keith's reliable.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Are you going to get to know him better

                      now?  Do you need to know more and more

                      about Keith.  More access.  Who knows how

                      it is, Mr. Fix-It today, murderer

                      tomorrow.  Is that what you're thinking?



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      I don't know.  It's your story.



            Sam gets up to leave.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      And Guy?  How's Guy?



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      His life is splitting in two, and he's

                      learning to lie to his wife.  He's never

                      felt happier.



            She smiles radiantly.  Sam looks into her eyes trying to

            penetrate her mystery, and can't.  So, he walks to the door.

            Hesitates at the door, turns around.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      And you?  Nicola?  How are you?



                                NICOLA SIX

                      I'm fine.



            She looks at him looking so beautiful, so vulnerable.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      You have just twenty days to go.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      That's fine with me.



            Sam approaches her with all the sympathy he's ever known.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Why?



                                NICOLA SIX

                      I don't know.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      You want to die?



            Nicola leans in and tries to kiss him on the lips.  He pulls

            away.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Not very much.  Not now.  When I'm with

                      you.



            She tries to kiss him again.  Sam pulls away.  It's awkward.

            Nicola is startled by this one man's rejection.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      No thank you.  I think I'd lose my

                      objectivity and write a bad novel about

                      you.



            He opens the door, turns his back to her, and hesitates

            before leaving.



            He turns around and she's already gone.



            INT. KEITH'S GARAGE - NEXT DAY - AFTERNOON



            Keith teaches darts to Sam, drinking a lager, sweating, among

            all his stolen merchandise, the gold bird, Mark Asprey's

            crystal ball award, and pornography playing on the TV

            (muted).



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Insincere dart.  No clinicism.  Throw it

                      right for Christ's sake.  Get the fucking

                      thing in there.



            Keith grows silent, grieving priestly.  Sam hesitates

            pointing his dart at the board on the wall.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      I've forgotten more than you'll ever know

                      about darts.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Aah, the darting poet and dreamer.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      I'm giving you some of my darts

                      knowledge.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      And I'm giving you fifty pounds an hour.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Respect that, Sam.  Respect it.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Go on, tell me everything you know about

                      the game.  I've got fifteen seconds.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      The sincerity of the dart, the address of

                      the board 7 feet 9 and a half inches as

                      set by the Darts Federation.  Weight on

                      the front foot.  Head still.  Then nice

                      follow through.  Grace the oche.

                             (whispering in his ear

                              direly)

                      You're looking at treble 20.  Nothing

                      else exists.  Nothing.  Throw the fucking

                      dart.



            Sam throws his dart, it lands on double 3.



                                KEITH  TALENT

                      Insincere dart.  No clinicism.  Throw it

                      right for Christ's sake.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Darts is a ridiculous game.  I don't care

                      anyway-



            Keith slams Sam and drops him against a heap of crates.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      You don't never show no disrespect for

                      the darts!  Okay?!



            Sam repositions himself in front of the dart board and throws

            a dart-treble 20!



                                KEITH TALENT

                      That's right treble 20!  What darts is

                      all about!



            Keith picks Sam up and whirls him around in the air.

INT. KEITH'S FORD CAVALIER - DUSK



                                SAM YOUNG

                      So how's Kath?



                                KEITH TALENT

                      M'wife?  What she expect?  Moaning on.

                      Baby this.  Baby that.  Can't sleep.

                      Babies is what a skirt does.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      I've looked after children - babies.

                      Babies worship their mothers but they

                      torture them too.  They torture them with

                      the sleep weapon.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      What would a bloke look after babies for?

                      It's not real work as such.  Why was you

                      looking after kids?



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      It wasn't a job.  Two years ago I lost my

                      brother.  They had a two year-old and

                      another one just arrived.  I was with

                      her, the widow, through all that-



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Sad, that.  Happens.  Say no more.



                                SAMSON YOUNG (continuing)

                      -all Kath needs is a couple of hours a

                      day with the baby off her hands.  It

                      would transform her.  I'd be glad to do

                      it.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      I've come across your sort before. In

                      prison.  That's turbulent ground.



            Caught off-guard Sam laughs.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      That's not me.



            Through the windshield angle up on the high rise council flat

            block with thousands of TV sets turned on.  Keith slows the

            car down to a halt.



            INT. KEITH'S TOWER BLOCK GOLBORNE RD. - SAME



            Ground floor starting to climb, the wind lifts garbage,

            plastic containers, papers, dust off the ground.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      You got the -?  For the darts lesson?



            Sam gives him the fifty pounds.  Keith looks at Sam

            unhappily.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      We going indoors.



            Keith's elevator is dead.  They climb the eleven floors,

            passing a litter of sick JUNKIES.



            Keith opens the door, avoids Sam's eyes.



            INT. KEITH'S HOME - SAME



            Faded, patient, KATH TALENT stands in the kitchen colours,

            cooking over a stove, baby KIM in her arms. The baby shines

            surrounded by poverty.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Sometimes love travels at the speed of

                      light.  The child... the child is an

                      angel.



            Kath looks confused.  This kind of poetic chatter is way over

            her head.



            Keith picks up his darts and throws a few at a board on the

            wall of the room.



            Kath offers Sam the baby.



                                KATH TALENT

                      Can you take her for a minute?



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Sure.



            He takes her and holds her up high above him.  Angle on Kim

            flying above Sam against the neon lights.  She looks down at

            Sam.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      There she is.  There she is.



            Sam steps on the stuffed furry rabbit on the kitchen floor.



            SLOW MOTION:  The rabbit let's out a few notes of a melody.

            SLOW MOTION:  Sam stands Kim up on the kitchen counter, tries

            to reach up to the cabinet handle, exposes bruises on her

            thighs, back, arms.



            SLOW MOTION:  O.S. a phone rings.  Keith's dart lands on the

            Bull's Eye.  Keith jumps up.  In mid-air he turns toward the

            ringing phone.



            SLOW MOTION:  In mid-air Keith turns, lands, picks up the

            phone.  His face contorts as fear hits him.



                                SAMSON YOUNG (O.S.)

                      This is the thing:  Keith is right now,

                      one inch from disaster.  And he knows it

                      now.



            EXT. TOWNHOUSE PARADINE STREET W1 - DAY



                                SAMSON YOUNG (O.S.)

                      He had been borrowing money on the

                      street, more particularly Paradine Street

                      in the West End.  He had been borrowing

                      from a loan shark- Kirk Stockist.



            SLOW-MOTION Keith and KIRK STOCKIST, an older wiseguy step

            out of a gold Rolls-Royce.  They shake hands.



            Keith pats a bulge in his pants where an envelope of cash is

            hidden.  Freeze frame on that last subtle movement of

            Keith's.



            SPLIT SCREEN:  2-WAY - Between Keith on PARADINE STREET and

            the CASINO.



            INT. CASINO - NIGHT



                                SAMSON YOUNG (O.S.)

                      Then he borrowed from Lee Crook in the

                      casino to pay the vig-on Kirk Stockist's

                      loan.



            SLOW-MOTION Past tasty GIRLS dealing cards and spinning

            wheels of fortune, Keith steps out of a back room with LEE

            CROOK, an extremely young wiseguy dressed in Gucci.  Keith is

            shaking Lee Crook's hand.  Once again Keith pats his bulging

            pants where an envelope of money protrudes.  Lee winks at

            him, flashes a diamond sparkling off his front tooth.  FREEZE

            FRAME.



            The PARADINE STREET side of the Split Screen moves at normal

            speed.  Keith walks out of frame, returns to Paradine Street

            townhouse to give Kirk Stockist Lee's casino money.  FREEZE

            FRAME



            SPLIT SCREEN:  3-WAY - adding to PARADINE STREET, and the

            CASINO, a WHOREHOUSE.



            INT. WHOREHOUSE SHEPHERD'S MARKET - NIGHT



                                SAMSON YOUNG (O.S.)

                      And then he borrowed from Ashley Royle in

                      his Mayfair whorehouse to pay another vig

                      Lee Crook.  What a mess.



            SLOW-MOTION Red lamp light, French Lessons sign in neon.

            Ashley Royle walks Keith out down the hallway passing a

            recognizable member of Parliament and a TV personality- RICK

            PURIST.  Rick bears an uncanny resemblance to Keith.  Keith

            stares, is nudged out reluctantly, mouthing his 'thank you'

            patting a money bulge in his pants.  FREEZE FRAME.



            SPLIT SCREEN:  3-WAY - Normal time speed at the CASINO, Keith

            returns to Lee Crook and gives him Ashley's whorehouse money.

            FREEZE FRAME:  All three screens locked still.



            INT. HEALTH CLUB - SUNSET



            Slow-motion muted:  Lee with cigarette, Ashley cigar, Kirk

            with cigarette and vodka, all walk on treadmills next to each

            other.  Above them a TV set is turned onto 'The Sopranos'

            show.  The middle guy holds the cell phone out front so that

            they all can scream at once.



                                SAMSON YOUNG (O.S.)

                      And now somehow they found out about each

                      other and now all three of them want

                      Keith to pay the whole damn thing.



            INT. KEITH'S COUNCIL FLAT - SAME



            Slow-motion C.U. on a handful of Keith's darts falling from

            his right hand, land, roll on the floor.  Sam in the

            background listens in.



                                ALL THREE (O.S.)

                      You fuckin' pay on Friday or we'll break

                      your Goddamned darts finger- cut off your

                      fuckin' darts finger- Slice off and feed

                      you your darts finger!



            Back to Normal time speed Keith tears at the phone and

            smashes it against the wall.  At the end of all that he

            stares at his fingers, his hands spread out before him, all

            powerful.  From his POV his hands glow like God's hands.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      I'm cold.  My hands are cold.  They're

                      numb, they are.  Oh, God.



            Keith pushes aside the pan of uncooked eggs and warms his

            hands by the gas stove top flames.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      My hands are numb.  Is this what it feels

                      like at the end, right before you go?



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Is it a lot of money?



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Yes.  Then that's what it feels like.



            INT. BLACK CAB - NIGHT - NEXT



            An old black cab drives up to Nicola's.  Stops.  The CABBIE

            looks in the mirror at his passenger.



            Sam, the passenger, on a cell phone, hesitates in the

            backseat.  Cautiously, he looks up at Nicola's.  He sees her

            easily.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      I just thought you should know Keith is

                      in trouble with his Vig.  He owes a lot

                      of money.



            She walks across the livingroom.  Turns her lights out.



                                NICOLA SIX (O.S.)

                      I'll get it for him.   And then he'll

                      love me forever.



            Sam sits back in the cab.  Thinking.



            INT. NICOLA'S APARTMENT - SAME



            She stands in her livingroom, sipping a red wine, listening

            and sensing someone is there.  She walks up to the window and

            looks down at the street.



            Angle on Sam's cab.  Just then, Sam moves away from the cab

            window.  The cab lights turn off.



            It's a standoff.  The only thing she can see is the Cabbie

            smoking a cigarette, parked.



            INT. BLACK CAB - SAME



                                NICOLA SIX (O.S.)

                      It's good to be loved.  Don't you think

                      Sam?



            Sam lifts the cell phone away from his ear.  He presses the

            END button.  Click.



            Sam is left there alone, unsettled.



            EXT. MARK ASPREY'S HOUSE - SUNDAY - MORNING



            The Sunday Times flies onto the stoop of Mark Asprey's.



            Some CHILDREN and their PARENTS rush past this converted

            rectory to go to church.



            INT. MARK ASPREY'S OFFICE - SUNDAY - SAME



            Sam is just rousing from having passed out on the desk last

            night writing his novel.  He leans over to read what's on the

            paper in the typewriter.  C.U. on the page in the typewriter.

            He reads the eight words at the top of the page out loud.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Like a bride, surveying the main actors

                      of the scene, immediately she knows, with

                      pain, with grave arrest, that she has

                      made contact with her murderer.



            He tears out the page.  Places it on a pile.



            Pages and pages are piling up everywhere.  He's been up

            writing all night.



            Sam stares into the desk.  E.C.U. on the lock and the gold

            embossed initials of M.A. on the desk.  He picks up some

            mementos from Mark Asprey's desk.



            E.C.U. on a pornographic love-letter C.U. on words like suck

            and lick partially covered by a lock of brunette hair the

            color and texture of Nicola's, attached to the letter with

            tape.



            E.C.U. on a polaroid in Sam's other hand.  A photo of a nude

            WOMAN from behind, in a kitchen straining pasta.  This could

            easily be Nicola.



            Sam puts these memorabilia beside Nicola's open diary.



            Angle on the locked drawer, monogrammed MA in gold leaf.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Maybe Mark Asprey's got a whole girl in

                      there.



            C.U. on Nicola's diary page, the initials MA circled in red

            ink with a question mark.  C.U. on the page which Sam reads

            aloud to himself.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      "The only one I keep going back to.  The

                      only one who is half a match for me.  The

                      only one I've ever been stupid for.  The

                      handsomest, the cruellest, the best in

                      bed (by far) is M.A. (He looks up from

                      reading her diary)  A resident of Notting

                      Hill.  Connected to the theatre.  M.A.



            Pan away from this open volume, over the 5 closed volumes of

            Nicola's diary.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      M.A.?  This fucking kills me.  Nicola and

                      M.A.?  Nicola and M.A.?



            Sam agonizes.  He looks up at a monumental wall of awards and

            prizes, photos and statues.



            Sam reaches for the deep desk drawer, tries to pry open the

            lock with a letter opener.  The desk's monogram is clearly

            visibly stenciled in gold around the lockhole - MA.  C.U. on

            the tip of the letter opener scratching the antique wood

            finish of the drawer, stopping on the gold inlay initials of

            MA.



            He looks outside.  Angle on his view of the park and the

            London clouds gathering in the distance.



            He returns to his typewriter.  Puts in a fresh page.  Types

            his novel.



                                SAMSON YOUNG (V.O.)

                      At this point Nicola operates a split

                      personality.  With only sixteen more days

                      till her birthday - and murder - but

                      somehow deep inside her - she knows

                      exactly what she is doing.



            EXT. LONDON FIELDS HYDE PARK SUNDAY - SAME



            AERIAL SHOT - You can see miles of the park where Nicola and

            Guy stroll on a path between the trees.



            Nicola in her blonde fur coat stares into the sky.  Guy in a

            corduroy suit, boots, stares at Nicola who looks staggeringly

            beautiful.



            Overhead a low hanging cloud cover moves across the sky

            marked by persistent strikes of lightning.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      The orphanage and charity school showed

                      me that great human kindness though hard

                      to find, does exist.  It was four rather

                      long years as a governess, two as a

                      nurse, novitiate- After my work with

                      cripples here, I cared for lepers in

                      India.



            EXT. HYDE PARK POND - NEXT



            They walk along the pavement beside the pond.  At the

            sculpture laden man-made pond, she is framed by angelic CUPID

            and fountains pouring water.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Now I'd like to be able to perform more

                      good works than I have in the past.

                      Somehow I feel so unproductive,

                      unfulfilled still, ineffectual.



            Aerial shot shows them walking towards Park Lane between tall

            elm trees.  They walk apart from each other.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      No, no, you're a saint Nicola.  Compared

                      to the average person that I come across.

                      You must give yourself credit.  You are

                      so unselfish.



            They pass by the large nubbie elm tree trunks, under the

            cover of twinkling leaves nestling in the breeze.  Leaves fly

            up off the ground and spin round before them on the path.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Maybe it's that life is so isolated, I

                      live in seclusion so much of the time, my

                      experience with ... others is so

                      unrevealing.  I have so little knowledge,

                      of what it's like.



            INT. FIVE STAR HISTORICAL RESTAURANT ST. JAMES' - NEXT



            Nicola speaks to the WAITER, drinks her martini quickly.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      A dozen oysters please.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      Nothing for me, thank you.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      (lighting a cigarette)  Are you shocked

                      by my dependencies?  I am.  As you've

                      gathered I'm rather a nervous person -

                      rather a ridiculous person, I'm afraid.

                      It's not very often I go out into the

                      world.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      Actually I find it touching.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      In the modern world it's not often...No.

                             (stopping herself)

                      Let me start again.  You see, today, I

                      must be sensible.  I do have something I

                      want to ask of you.  During my early

                      years in the orphanage, I befriended a

                      little Burmese girl -beautiful,

                      abandoned.  Like partners in a

                      concentration camp where the enemy was

                      lovelessness, we kept each other going.

                      When I was twelve I went on to the

                      charity school, really a blacking

                      factory, while my little soulmate was

                      adopted or farmed out to a pitiless

                      Iraqi.  The man abused her.  There was

                      violence.  She- She fell.  Do you

                      understand?



            Guy nods grimly.  The oysters arrive. With a fingertip Nicola

            directs the waiter to replenish her martini.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      I would weep over her letters.  Her life

                      was so very much harder than my life,

                      even with the headmaster's switch, all of

                      it.  She had the child:  a son.  She was

                      then repatriated, never to return...



                                GUY CLINCH

                      Burma?  She's still there?  My God.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      The Proxy War.  Occasionally a blood

                      smudged dispatch written on toilet paper

                      or Elasoplast finds it's way to me.

                      Mother and Child were sighted in a

                      refugee camp in Thailand, a resettlement

                      facility in Burma, and a slave camp in

                      Burma.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      It's hopeless there.  The whole area.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      You know, in a way it's ruined my life as

                      well as hers.  I feel so desperately

                      incomplete without her.  I think that's

                      why I never...but that's another story.

                      I must bring them back.  I'll never feel

                      whole until I bring them back.  You have

                      connections don't you Guy?  Is there

                      perhaps something you could do?  Inquire?



                                GUY CLINCH

                      Yes.  I could certainly try.



            She is given another martini which she drinks quickly.

            Nicola hands him a paper.  She eats her eleventh oyster.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Could you?  Their names are here.  I'd be

                      eternally in your debt.  Little Boy was

                      always simply known as Little Boy, though

                      he's almost a man now.  Her name is En

                      Lah Gai.  I called her Enola.  Enola Gay.



            Samson Young walks up to Guy's table.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      So great to see you, Guy.  Am I

                      interrupting?  Did I come too soon?



            Guy checks his watch.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      No Samson.  You're right on time.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                             (to Nicola)

                      Hello.



            Nicola smiles, disinterested.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      Please.  This is Nicola Six.  Samson

                      Young.



            Guy stands up.  Sam and Nicola shake hands.  Sam sits next to

            Nicola.  Guy sits down.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Pleasure.  We met in a pub, actually.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Excellent memory.



            Nicola ignores Sam.  A WAITER takes Sam's order.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Kettle 1 on the rocks.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Guy?  I take it you're married?



            Sam watches her manipulate Guy.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      Yes.  Yes.  And I too have an adorable

                      little boy.  My wife Hope and I have been

                      married fifteen years.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      That's not so common any more.  Marrying

                      so young.  How romantic.  Well done.



            Sam can't believe the shit she's getting away with.  The

            waiter places a drink before Sam, a brandy before Guy.  Guy

            signals to the waiter for the bill.  Another WAITER offers

            Guy a cigar from an open humidor cigar box.  Guy takes one.

            Sam puts his arm around the back of the banquet, leans into

            Nicola.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                             (whispers)

                      He believes everything.



                                NICOLA SIX

                             (whispers)

                      Why shouldn't he.  It's all true.



            She watches Guy pay the check.  Guy looks up.  Doesn't catch

            anything wrong.  Puffs on his cigar.



            EXT. STREET ST. JAMES' - NEXT



            Nicola then Sam exit the restaurant together.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      I'll drop you, now.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      When will I see you?



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      In four hours.  Eight o'clock.  At

                      Keith's darts match Peckham.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      I'll see you then.  Wish me luck.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      You don't need it.



            Guy steps out of the restaurant and joins Nicola and Sam.

            BANKERS and BUSINESSMEN in bowler hats crowd them on the

            sidewalk.



            She hails a radio cab, (like the car in her premonition).

            Guy opens the door for her.



            Sam stands back observing Guy and Nicola.  They exchange some

            words.  Guy touches her arm gently.



                                CAB DRIVER

                      Get in.



            She hesitates.



                                CAB DRIVER

                      Get in!



            She puts her hand on the car door handle.  Freezes.  Traffic

            jams up.  Car horns honk.



                                CAB DRIVER

                      Get in!  Miss!  Get in!



            Angle on cab driver's lap - no tire iron (weapon).  She turns

            back to Guy as her tears fall from her eyes and roll down her

            face.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      You're crying.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Help me.  I'm so terribly alone.  Please

                      help me.  Find them.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      I promise I will.



            She enters the back seat.  The car drives off.  Her poppy red

            fingernails tighten around the arm rest.



            INT. RADIO CAB - SAME



            She turns to Guy through the window glass.  Her own face

            reflects upon the window glass over Guy's face.  As the car

            pulls away, she sees Sam join Guy and walk off together.  Guy

            turns, looks back at Nicola for one more haunting glimpse of

            her.  Sam watches Guy lose his heart to Nicola, makes a

            mental note of it.



            INT. BRIXTON HALL DARTS MATCH - 8PM NIGHT



            Keith's dart hits the board.



                                REFEREE

                      Double 18.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Showmanship innit.  Sheer showmanship.



                                REFEREE

                      Double 18.  Keith Talent is the champion.



            Keith stands on stage, stunned by victory.



            Sam, Nicola, and the Black Cross gang stick out amongst an

            all male 99% black AUDIENCE who stand howling.  A bottle

            crashes onto the low stage not far from Keith Talent.



                                AUDIENCE

                      Boo!  Boo!  Off!  Off!  Fuck off whitey!



            Keith turns to the audience and frees his underpants from

            between his buttocks, makes an obscene gesture.



                                KEITH  TALENT

                             (to his opponent)

                      No disrespect, mate, but there's always

                      going to be a question mark over the

                      temperament of the black thrower.



            His opponent advances on him with one dart raised like a

            knife aimed at his heart.  Keith takes that dart and stabs

            his opponent in his hand.  Sam leans over to Nicola.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Keith Talent.  At this moment he is a

                      winner and he has his head in the clouds

                      free.  This ought to please you

                      tremendously.  It's exactly how you want

                      him.  Relaxed and happy.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Take me home please.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Sure.  Let's go.  Do you think Keith will

                      reach the darts final?



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Oh, he will.  He will win the next two

                      qualifying tournaments.  I see that very

                      clearly.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Is it Keith then?  Is Keith your

                      murderer?



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Can't think like that.  I've got to get

                      out of here.



            Nicola struggles through the CROWD as Sam leads her outside

            into the rainy street.



            INT. MARK ASPREY'S ENTRANCEWAY - NEXT



            Sam opens the door, rushes into the house, drenched in his

            raincoat and hat.  Holds the door open for Nicola.  Nicola

            looks like a spy in a raincoat, wet brunette hair, dripping

            umbrella.  He helps her off with her coat.  She studies the

            place pretending she'd never been here before.  Wipes the

            rain off her face.  She looks nervous, uncomfortable.



            Sam shows her into the living room, smiling.  He opens a

            bottle of champagne, hands her a full glass.  She looks at

            the photographs on the coffee table.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Call it off, Nicola.  Do something else.

                      Live.



                                NICOLA SIX

                             (overly emotional)

                      It's not up to me.  But, it's going to

                      happen just as I've said, on my birthday.

                      The same day as Keith's darts final.

                      Lovely thing that.  It gives me great

                      confidence as the murderee - that events

                      are moving now.  And only twelve days

                      left.



            She takes a cigarette.  Sam doesn't lose a moment to light

            it.  Sam looks at her with grave concern.



            O.S. a phone rings and rings...Sam struggles to keep up.



            O.S. as phone rings.  Sam stands.  Nicola stands.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Aren't you going to answer the phone?

                      Where's the lady's?



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Down that hall next to MA's office.



            She gives no reaction to the mention of Mark Asprey's

            initials.  Sam watches her walk out of the room.  He turns

            the volume up on the message machine speaker.



                                MISSY HARTER

                             (on machine)

                      Your book deal is going through.  You'll

                      hear from the lawyers.  I'm time urgent.

                      Call me.



            Click.  Sam is surprised this definitely throws him off

            guard.



            Sam is very pleased.  A tree bangs against the window.

            Thunder strikes nearby.  Hale pelts the glass window.



            He walks out of the room.



            INT. MARK ASPREY'S OFFICE LIBRARY - NEXT



            Sam walks by and spies Nicola in Mark Asprey's office:  bent

            over his desk, trying to pry open the locked drawer with a

            letter opener.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      So, you're in love with him?  M.A.?



            She gives him a sobering stare.  Walks out of the office.  He

            follows her, masking his agitation poorly.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Stick to the story.  You're confusing the

                      issue.



            She walks into the livingroom.  Sits on the couch.  Crosses

            her long legs.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      How am I supposed to write your story

                      when you won't answer me?



                                NICOLA SIX

                      I can't.  It's all in the diary.  That's

                      it.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Fuck you then.  I'm outta here.  I don't

                      know you.  I can't write about you.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Sam.  Wait.  Please.  Don't leave me now.



            Sam turns around.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Why?  Why do you care if I go or not?

                      What's it matter to someone like you?



                                NICOLA SIX

                      No one knows me.  I can't change.  Don't

                      you understand?  It's not really up to

                      me.  Please don't hate me.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      I'm sorry.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Tell me something good.  What page are

                      you up to on my story?



            He sits down opposite her.  He looks ill.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Our story.



            Nicola stands to depart.  She kisses Sam's cheek.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      You look ill.



            She kisses Sam's other cheek.  Lingers.  Sam moves his face

            imperceptibly towards her, then hesitates and moves away from

            her.  She senses him grow distant.  Nicola breaks the spell.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Keith should be calling me soon.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      I think he's got a robbery lined up.

                      He's got to pay the Vig.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      He won't get caught.  If that's what you

                      want to know.  I think I can find my way

                      out.



            She leaves.  Sam closes the door.  Her visit was a sobering

            intoxicating experience.  He walks off to the office library

            to learn more.
INT. MARK ASPREY'S OFFICE LIBRARY - SAME



            Sam rushes up to the diaries and frantically tries to find

            the MA references.  He's so flustered he shoves everything,

            including the diaries, on the floor.  He takes a letter

            opener and stabs it into the MA initials embossed on the

            desk.



                                                              FADE INTO:



            EXT. OPIUM FIELD BURMA - DAY



            Acres of red poppies with black opium centers.  Opium SLAVE

            FARMERS lift pales of water like oxen, irrigating the fields,

            under gunpoint.  Five SOLDIERS, smoking opium, aim their guns

            and shoot at an exhausted LADY and a BOY SLAVE.  Gravely

            injured, they collapse.  The soldiers laugh at them, prod

            them with their guns, and shoot them again.



            A PRIEST looks at them from a window in a Red Cross building.

            Some NUNS run out into the field screaming at the Soldiers.



            INT. GUY CLINCH'S OFFICE PARK SIDE - MORNING



            Guy in a three piece pinstripe suit at his desk with its

            single Visual Display Unit, in his Japanese 'minimal' design

            modern office, overlooking Hyde Park.  He speaks on one of

            five phones.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      Her name is E-N-O-L-A Christian name, G-A

                      Y.  Enola Gay.  Her son is known as just

                      Little Boy.



            INT. RED CROSS BUILDING DAY BURMA - SAME



            Amidst O.S. the sound of a single gunshot fired.



                                PRIEST

                      I'll try.  It's difficult for me just as

                      yet.  I've written it down.  Enola Gay

                      and Little Boy.  Right you are.  I have

                      your phone numbers.  Yes.  In fact, the

                      Archbishop's office did call.  Of course.

                      God bless.



            The Priest hangs up the phone.  Two slave farmers , the lady

            and the boy, are carried past the priest on stretchers.



            INT. BLACK CROSS PUB - SAME DAY - LATE AFTERNOON



            Straight out of the office, Guy is still in his three piece

            pinstripe suit.  Sam is with Guy.  Keith shouts over the pub

            music to Guy as he backs away out of the Black Cross, hands

            in pockets, looking hungry.  Keith wears low hip-hugging

            flares and an electromagnetic shirt, accompanied by his

            faithful dog Clive.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Did you see her?  Did you fuck her?



            Guy flinches.  Sam laughs, walking to keep up with Keith.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      You don't understand.  I did see her

                      earlier yesterday but-  She doesn't...

                      she's not- She's not like that.  I'm

                      trying to, to trace someone for her.  I'm

                      trying to help her.



                                KEITH TALENT

                             (angry)

                      Listen.  I want something?  I go for it.

                      Me?  I'm in there.  Boof.  I'm like a

                      dog.  You kick me?  I don't run and hide.

                      I'm back.  I'm in there.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      Keith, you're upset.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      You're all the fucking same.



            Keith walks to the bar leaving Guy feeling inadequate.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      What will it be?  Scotch or Vodka?



                                GUY CLINCH

                      Vodka.  Please Sam, let me buy you a

                      drink.



            Sam pities him.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Don't you know it's not over til it's

                      over.



            Sam laughs, finishes his drink.



            INT. NICOLA'S BEDROOM - NEXT



            Working, preparing her character, at her makeup mirror.  She

            is transformed with tousled hair, a depressed, sleepy look,

            wearing a white cotton dress.



            She messes up the bed so it looks like she's tossed and

            turned in it sleepless all night.



            She walks into the living room for Guy.



            INT. NICOLA'S LIVING ROOM - SAME



            Guy steps forward, concerned.  She looks haunting.  You'd

            believe whatever she says.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      My news isn't terribly encouraging.

                      Would you rather I come back another

                      time?



            Muted- Guy talks on, hands her the globe.  She flops into a

            seat.  O.S. hail is the one thing she can hear tapping the

            windows.  She turns to him.  She can hear his voice again.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      ...I don't want to be a total wet

                      blanket.  The man I know at Greenpeace is

                      trying to make contact with a clearing

                      house in Burma.  There are several

                      avenues still untried.



            Silence.  Her tears well up in her eyes.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      I'm sorry.  I'm so sorry.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      I have a confession to make.  Hear me

                      out, and then go away forever.  I never

                      thought my life would change.  I thought

                      it would just go on, like this.  Or I

                      would end it.  I never thought I'd meet

                      anyone good.  I just mean good.  And now

                      it's happened and...  oh, Guy, I'm so

                      completely thrown.



                                GUY CLINCH

                             (cutting her speech suddenly)

                      Say it.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      I'm in love.  With you.  There's just one

                      other thing.  I warned you I was a

                      ridiculous person.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      What is it?



                                NICOLA SIX

                      I'm a virgin.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      I've never known purity in a woman

                      before.



            This news leaves Guy struggling with this information

            speechless.  In the end he worships her for being a virgin.



            INT. MARK ASPREY'S SITTING ROOM - NEXT DAY



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      And nor had I.



            Sam stands nervously, fidgeting, uncomfortably jealous.  The

            low sun glares into his eyes.  Nicola lounges in a sweater

            and snakeskin pants drinking a large  quantity of straight

            vodka in a tall cut crystal glass tumbler.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Why do you think you did that?



                                NICOLA SIX

                      I don't know why I told Guy I was a

                      virgin.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Let me guess.  You knew he'd believe you.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Yes.  I almost said the other thing:

                      'I'm pregnant.'  Whoops!  Now that would

                      have been quite bad.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      No coming back from there.  Why would you

                      say that?



            She looks at Sam as though he should know.



            Sam squints and looks at her all sensual, sipping her drink

            like a cat.  Sam's beginning to get more interested in her.

            More than he'd like.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      I'm tired of your questions.  I wonder

                      what Keith is doing now?



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      I have no idea.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Actually.  He's expected at my place

                      shortly.  I bought a white bikini for the

                      occasion.



            She pulls a tiny Versace shopping bag out of her purse, to

            show Sam the bikini.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                             (jealous)

                      A bikini?  For him?  I can't take anymore

                      of this.



            She jumps on him all needy.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Don't be that way.  You've got to come

                      and see.  You still don't understand.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Well it's hard sometimes.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      I bet it is.



            Sam pulls away.  Nicola laughs.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      What's so funny?



                                NICOLA SIX

                      I'm mixed up.  Is it Guy that's coming

                      over, not Keith?  No.  Keith is coming

                      over.  I think.



            She laughs very confused, dizzy, carefree, amused, and drunk.

            Sam sits down and watches her with great interest.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      How are you ever going to get home to

                      answer the door?



            She laughs hysterically.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      I don't know.  But I always do.  I like

                      to.



            EXT. BLACK CROSS PUB - NEXT



            Keith steps out of the Black Cross, sees a British Racing

            Green Jag turn the corner to his right.  A low sun whitens

            the street.  A dust storm picks up dirt, newspaper, leaves,

            and blows past Keith.  Keith runs away across the street.

            The car stops.



            SOMEONE jumps out of the car, runs after Keith.  It's gotta

            be someone the Vig sent to collect on the money Keith owes.

            Keith runs for it.  The man runs after Keith.  A high speed

            chase through a brick alley of Portobello Road.



            Keith jumps a fence onto a grass courtyard.



            He stoves in a kitchen window. Jumps into the house.

            Disappears.  His pursuer sees the broken glass window and

            climbs in.



            EXT. OTHER SIDE OF HOUSE - SAME



            Keith hails a cab.  Steps into the cab.  Departs.



                                                        FADE INTO WHITE:



            INT. NICOLA'S SKYLIGHT - NEXT



            From Keith's POV as his eyes adjust to the glare of white

            sunlight.  Keith upon a stepladder ascends slowly into the

            brilliant low hanging sunlight.  He sees an elbow, a brown

            shoulder, and the rest of Nicola lying in white underwear

            aglow in sunlight.  She is solarized into a white hot,

            glowing silhouette.  The wind whistles by, blowing her hair.



            INT. NICOLA'S APARTMENT - SAME



            Keith's body stops dead halfway up the ladder to the sunroof.

            The bottom half of his body in his hip-hugging jeans is in

            the apartment, his head is outside peeping out onto the roof.



            EXT. NICOLA'S SKYLIGHT ROOFTOP - SAME



            Keith's POV C.U. on a drop of perspiration between her

            breasts as it rolls down her skin and over the water

            repellent bathing suit top.



            Keith climbs onto the rooftop, taking in the sight of Nicola,

            afraid to blink and miss something.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Hello.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      'She wore an itsy-witsy teeny-weeny',

                      yeah cheers.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Do you know the etymology of bikini

                      Keith?



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Wha?



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Bikini Atoll in the Marshall Islands,

                      Keith, the site of the U.S. atomic bomb

                      tests.  I still don't see how this

                      inevitably leads to a 'scanty two-piece

                      beach garment worn by women.'



            She and Keith both look down at her body as she chats.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Both are do or die situations.



            Two birds play in a pool of rainwater on the rooftop.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Playing tonight, you know.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Darts?



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Darts.  Yeah.  My confidence is high.

                      I'm oozing confidence.  I know the

                      knockers take the piss, but there's

                      considerable prestige in the sport these

                      days.  The final's televised.  If I taste

                      victory there I go on to play Kim

                      Twemlow, the world's number one, before

                      the cameras.  Kim Twemlow- The man's like

                      a god to me.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      I see.  Well I'm sure you'll prosper,

                      Keith.  In fact I know that you'll win.



            INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME



            Nicola enters, still wearing her bikini.  Keith in front of

            the pile of appliances on the floor.  The open windows let in

            an onslaught of low direct sunlight, like bleach.  Keith

            struggles against the sunlight to see Nicola clearly, fully.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Now I'm at it.  Got you fixed up.  Is

                      there - is there anything more you'd like

                      me to do for you?



                                NICOLA SIX

                      You mean sex?  We'll see, Keith.  All in

                      good time.  First some questions.  Can

                      you keep your mouth shut, Keith?  Do you

                      have to run and tell the boys about all

                      your good times?



                                KEITH TALENT

                      No way.  Never do that.



                                NICOLA SIX

                             (sarcastic)

                      I'm sure you don't.  All right.  We're

                      going to do this at my speed.  All right?



                                KEITH TALENT

                      You're on.



            She hands him a shower attachment and a book.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Take these.  You don't have to do

                      anything with them.  They're props.  Just

                      props.



            O.S. the buzzer sounds loudly.  She presses the door open

            button.



            EXT. NICOLA'S APT HOUSE - SAME



            Sam and a Mercedes radio cab and DRIVER wait for Nicola's

            answer.



            INT. NICOLA'S APT - SAME



            Nicola buzzes Sam in.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Who's that?



                                NICOLA SIX

                      The first test of your discretion is on

                      his way up the stairs.  Remember:  Sssh.



            She places the roll of money into the crotch of her bikini

            bottoms, and pats it.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Keith!  It looks like - it looks like...



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Yeah.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      I've got a pistol in my pocket.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Uh...yes.



                                NICOLA SIX

                             (offering her crotch)

                      Here.



            He reaches for it.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Don't touch.



            But she allows him to touch enough.  E.C.U. on the bikini

            material, and the money.  He lifts the border of the bikini

            off her skin.  His fingers proceed into the void between her

            skin and her bikini.  Angle on her face.  She's watching.  So

            far you can tell he hasn't touched her.  Angle on Keith's

            face struggling.  C.U. on his fingers sliding the money out.



            C.U. on Nicola inhaling through her flaired nostrils.



            INT. NICOLA'S STAIRS - SAME



            Keith stops, with his shower attachment and book, looks back

            at Nicola's.   He walks back up to her door slightly ajar.

            He hovers here in hesitation.  Nicola faces him.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      We're going to do this at my speed.



            She closes the door.

                      No.  No, not your speed.  My speed.  With

                      the Fast Forward and the Freeze Frame and

                      a bit of the old Slomo near the end.

                      Rape Nicky.  At a man's speed, with none

                      of the brakes women use if you let them.



            He turns away from Nicola's door.  Sam is standing there

            observing.



                                SAMSON YOUNG (V.O.)

                      In the end Keith had to leave it.  Even

                      though he felt the rape capability.

                      After all, even Keith knows there's no

                      money in rape.  But there is money in

                      Nicola Six.



            Keith turns back down the stairs and descends.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Hey, Keith.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Sam.



            Sam marches up to Nicola's, just as she opens her door, to go

            out.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      I'm ready.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Okay.



            EXT. THE LONDON THAMES - LATER THAT DAY - DUSK



            Angle on the Thames water reflecting city lights in choppy

            waves.  Nicola stands with Guy along the river by the Savoy

            Hotel.  She touches her hair.  Nicola, in her beret, in her

            skirt suit and tie looking like a WWII nurse.  Leaning

            against the railing they face each other.  Her hands slide

            into his.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Thank you for all the sentiments you have

                      awoken in me.  It was wonderful to learn

                      that I could have these feelings.  My

                      love, if you... you see, I suspect that

                      there is something deeply frivolous about

                      pursuing a course that holds so little

                      prospect of good.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      You're an angel - but - even an angel-



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Please, I can't trust my resolve.  I'll

                      never forget you.



            She takes her hands back.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Now, I'm going to walk away.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      Darling, no-



                                NICOLA SIX

                      And I want you to let me.  Let me go.



            She turns and as ordered, he watches her walk away until she

            is long gone.



            Out of sight Nicola crosses the street.  Sam in his black

            radio cab Mercedes are waiting.  She gets into the back seat.

            The Driver takes them away together.



            EXT. GOLGATHA PUB - SAME



            C.U. on the green Jaguar sliding into frame.  It's the same

            person who chased Keith, from before, because of the money he

            owes the Vig.  The Jaguar drives alongside a parked,

            conspicuously customized, Mini.  The car is souped-up, low

            slung with rally lights, customized chrome fenders, and

            celebrity windows.  From one of the Vig's POV we see a slice

            of the view inside the Mini.



            He just barely misses seeing Keith hiding.  He lays down in a

            reclining position in the driver's seat.  Keith raises his

            seatback up.  Waits.  Keith looks at his darts finger.



            Thelonius is drunk, as he gets into the car looking every bit

            the pimp.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Where've you been?  Eh?  I been sitting

                      'ere.  Time just goes.  And I stay the

                      same.  Waiting 'ere for what?



            Thelonius slams his hands on the dashboard, kicks the car.



                                THELONIUS

                             (Jamaican accent)

                      Sdoveo.  Lots of digital videos.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      We won't be getting too many digital

                      videos in here mate.  This minge-wagon is

                      pretty eye-catching.



                                THELONIUS

                      Dis is da care man of my baby mama.

                      Nothing wrong wit dat girl.



            EXT. BACK DOOR TAVISTOCK ROAD STORE - LATER



            C.U. on Thelonius' key as it turns the lock.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Ba-da-bing.



            INT. TAVISTOCK ROAD STORE - NEXT



            In the dark.



                                THELONIUS

                      Torch onna blink!



            Keith at the cashier's till smashes it open, pulls out a

            fistful of luncheon vouchers.  Thelonius ignites his Ronson

            lighter.



                                KEITH  TALENT

                      LVs, man.  Sonofabitch luncheon vouchers.

                      I know this place.  It's a fucking corner

                      shop  There's no videos.  All they got

                      here's a load of fuckin pork pies!



            Keith unwraps a pork pie, eats it.  They hear footsteps from

            the owner's apartment upstairs.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      What are those footsteps?



                                THELONIUS

                      Joolery, man.  She dripping with joolery.



            Thelonius ducks upstairs.  Keith opens the front door,

            cranes his neck to read the store's sign.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      N. Poluck Cornish Dairy and Confectioner.



            INT. N. POLUCK'S BEDROOM - SAME



            With frightening speed, a gym shoe whips across the screen

            repeatedly.  Thelonius beats both MR. AND MRS. POLUCK,

            thrashing them with a gym shoe.  They are half hidden under a

            heap of clothes.  In a home that has no valuables in it - not

            ever.  Their faces and bodies stuck in a painful pose.  Keith

            walks into the room and turns to Thelonius.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      You're a grave disappointment Thelonius

                      you are.  None of the relaxed

                      concentration you're always hoping to see

                      in a thief.



            Keith strides up to Thelonius, puts a cigarette in his mouth,

            lights it for him.  Keith tousles his hair, C.U. on his

            fingers in his hair.  E.C.U. following the path of the

            dandruff falling from his head to his shoulders, where Keith

            brushes it off onto a dark table surface.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Hair dust everywhere.  Bingo.  DNA innit.



            Thelonius pushes Keith away, resumes whipping the Polucks

            with a gym shoe.



            EXT. STORE - NEXT



            Keith walks out with a carton of cigarettes under his arm.

            He walks past Thelonius's Mini car.



            EXT. PORTOBELLO ROAD - NEXT



            Sam walks with Nicola along the crowded sidewalk.  She holds

            his arm, smoking a cigarette, still wearing the WWII nurse on

            a date look from earlier that night.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      We've got Keith now.  It doesn't take

                      Keith's brain much time to go over all of

                      his financial possibilities.

                             (she shoots him a look)

                      He has none.  You're his only shot.  And

                      he's locked into you -

                             (imitating Keith)

                      Nic-o-la-Six.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      You've been doing your homework on Keith

                      I see.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Time for you to go home.



            She laughs.  They're both exhilarated.



            She faces him as they rush faster.  The background blurrs.

            She stands out.  He stands out.  Wind in their hair.



            In sync with each other they stop in front of Nicola's

            street.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Let me know how it goes with Keith.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Of course darling.



            He takes her cigarette out of her mouth and takes a drag on

            it.  It's truly the two of them against the world.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      You have him exactly where you want him.

                      And you're on time - ten minutes late.



            Nicola looks at Sam seductively.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Go.



            She walks away towards her house, turns.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Are you sure you don't want to come and

                      watch?



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      I've got dinner at Guy's.  I've got to

                      write.  There's not much time left.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      I know.  Time is running out.



            Sam upset, turns and walks away.



            INT. NICOLA'S APT SITTING-ROOM - NEXT - THAT EVENING



            Nicola and Keith in the dark apartment.  The phone rings.

            The answer machine picks up.  O.S. we hear Guy leave a

            message.  Nicola turns on the lights



                                GUY CLINCH (O.S.)

                      Nicola, please, I can't just let you go-



            She runs to the phone.  Picks up the receiver.  The answer

            machine records it and amplifies it loudly, so Keith can

            hear.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Guy if it's you... please wait... I

                      apologize but I don't trust myself with

                      you.



            Keith coughs.  Nicola kisses a forefinger to her lips- for

            silence.  With fear in his eyes Keith nervously massages his

            darts finger.



                                GUY CLINCH (O.S.)

                      There's so much I have to, I want to say-



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Please, Guy, you must never contact me

                      ever again.  Think of me sometimes.  If

                      you get news of my friends, well, perhaps

                      a note.



            Over the message machine speaker Guy is audibly choking.  He

            tries to clear his throat.



            EXT. CLINCH HOUSE - SAME



            The wind is so strong as a snow storm centers around Guy's

            house.  The house lights are on.  Zoom from the street up to

            the master bedroom on the second floor.



            INT. GUY CLINCH'S BEDROOM - SAME



            Zoom into the dark bedroom, a fire crackling in the fireplace

            across from the bed.



            Zoom into Guy's tragic face flickering on and off the fire's

            light.  Sad.  Dejected.  Alone.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      Don't do this Nicola.



            INT. NICOLA'S APARTMENT -SAME



                                NICOLA SIX

                      I have to.  This is goodbye.



            Guy breathes into the speaker distraught.



            Keith sits on her couch, flexes his hands, his knee shakes

            visibly.  They both listen to Guy.



                                GUY CLINCH (O.S.)

                      Goodbye.  God bless.

                             (click)



            Finally, Nicola hangs up.  The answer machine shuts off.

            Awkward silence.  Keith's the first to talk.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Brush off innit.  Jesus, there's no money

                      here.  First the robbery with no luck.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      The robbery?



                                KEITH TALENT

                      What am I?  I have my life in my hands.

                      My life?  Risking my darts fingers.

                      Counting on what?  This?  You?



                                NICOLA SIX

                      I don't know.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Shame.  So it didn't work out.  All over,

                      is it?



                                NICOLA SIX

                      To tell you the truth, Keith, it isn't

                      over.  In fact, it's going stronger than

                      ever now.  I could hear real passion in

                      his voice.  For Guy, the idea is the

                      thing.  Guy's a romantic, Keith.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Yeah?  Yeah, he does dress funny.



            INT.  GUY CLINCH'S MASTER BEDROOM - SAME



            Poor Guy, devastated, weak, gathers himself, puts on a facade

            of okayness, walks out of the room.



            Walks down the hallway.



            Down the stairs.



            Enters the kitchen.



            INT.  GUY CLINCH'S KITCHEN DINNER PARTY - NEXT



            From Guy's POV as he nears the full dinner table party.  He

            sees Hope next to a very handsome man, DINK HECKLER, South

            Africa's #1 tennis pro, dressed in tennis whites.  LIZZYBOO,

            Hope's younger blonde American sister from down South, sits

            opposite Dink, next to Samson Young.



            At the head of the table is Guy's empty chair.  Guy sees his

            wife's face close to Dink's flirting.



            All attention turns to Guy as he frowns at this.  Shuffles

            into his chair looking like he's been killed.



            INT.  NICOLA SIX'S APARTMENT SITTING ROOM - SAME



                                KEITH  TALENT

                      Guy said, he told me he was "tracing"

                      someone.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Oh, that.  That was just crap I want to

                      get some money from him.  It'll come.  It

                      won't take very long at all.  And really

                      it's quite a lot of money.  You can have

                      some of it in four days exactly.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      You're quite a little actress, aren't you

                      Nick?



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Nicola.  Oh, literally so, Keith.  You

                      can always kill me if you don't get the

                      money Keith.

                             (Keith gives no response)

                      Come and sit here.  Poor you.  You're

                      hungover.  All that celebrating, I should

                      think from your darts.  Now take off your

                      coat.  There's something I want to show

                      you to build your motivation.



            She presses the remote control and her video plays on TV.

            Keith watches in a seizure of fascination,  looking back and

            forth between Nicola and the girl inside the television.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      You're a fucking miracle.



            On video:



            Her film debut in a cheesey movie thriller made years ago.

            Nicola appears younger, brooding, lip-biting, then she

            screams.



            In a series of adverts for sunglasses, Tanned and tousled and

            wide-mouthed.



            Then the finale:  a pre-credit sequence of a feature film, a

            striptease in the back room of a gentleman's club full of

            sweating young STOCKBROKERS.  You see it all just before the

            end when she disappears in smoke and shadows.



            Nicola turns the TV off with the remote control.



            Keith jolts.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      That's it?



                                NICOLA SIX

                      I get killed later on.  You don't see it.

                      You just hear about it later.



            Keith grabs at the controls.  Nicola playfully won't give it.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Gimme the controls.  I want to see it

                      again.  Like freeze-frame it.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      No.  Once is all you get.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Jesus, beautiful.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      You run into Guy pretty often, don't you?



                                KEITH TALENT

                      That's right.  If there's any way I can

                      be of service.  Because I'm very anxious

                      basically to see his money.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Good.  Next time.  Tell him this.  Tell

                      him I'm pale and drawn.  Tell him that

                      all I do now is sit by the window,

                      sighing.  Tell him I finger a beautiful

                      globe, and ruefully smile, and turn away.

                      You know the sort of stuff.  He's a

                      romantic, remember.  So work on that.  In

                      your own style, Keith, of course.  In

                      your own words.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Jack Daniels.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Well then.  Be good.  And come and see me

                      again very soon.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Old Grandad.  Come on, Nick.  Your speed -

                      okay.  I respect that.  I'll exercise

                      restraint.  But give me something to help

                      keep my mind off the Vig.  Show me you

                      care.  Nicola.  I'm in so much trouble,

                      give me something good to think about.

                      Give me a taste.  Come on, doll.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Of course.



            Keith closes his eyes.  She gives him a fantastic kiss.



                                NICOLA SIX

                             (releasing a sound of

                              pleasure)

                      Umagh...Patience Keith.  You'll find with

                      me that when it rains, it pours.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Jim Beam.  Benedictine.  Yeah, cheers.



            They kiss again.



            Keith can no longer wait.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Nicola?  Nick I'm desperate.  I'm fuckin'

                      desperate.  I got to have it now.  Now.

                      Not soon.  Not next week.



            Nicola smiles.  Keith shows her his index finger.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Or I just kiss goodbye to this.  See?  I

                      got to have it now.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      What?



                                KEITH TALENT

                      The money!



            She just missed the point totally.  She had no idea.  She

            thought he was turned on by her and wanted sex from her.  And

            that he couldn't wait for her.  But Keith doesn't want

            anything from her except money.  The Vig saw to that.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Oh for Christ's sake.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      You don't know the kind of pus I'm

                      dealing with here.  Okay, call me a cunt,

                      I took double money on the street.  Now I

                      made the list and come Friday I get a

                      kicking and they break my fucking darting

                      finger cut it off and all.

                             (he shows his finger)

                      That's how low they'll stoop.  See, it

                      brooks no delay.  If that happens, I'm

                      out of it.  I'm history.  I'm a fucking

                      dinosaur.



                                NICOLA SIX

                             (tightening her necktie)

                      I'll get the money soon actually.  You're

                      going to reach the final, Keith.  I know

                      it.  I wouldn't be behind you otherwise.

                      Why don't you stop by.  Soon.



            She departs, looking back on a desperate Keith.

INT. RETURNING TO THE CLINCH HOUSE KITCHEN DINNER PARTY -

            LATE THAT NIGHT



            Guy sits, eats nothing, looks dead.  The twin screens of the

            closed-circuit TV monitors, emit Marmaduke's raspy breathing

            worsens.  Dink and Hope exchange a knowing look.  Snow falls

            outside.  Sam looks at Guy awkwardly.



                                HOPE CLINCH

                      So how much more of this do we get?



                                GUY CLINCH

                      More of what?



                                HOPE CLINCH

                      Of the famished mute.  You don't eat

                      anything.  And you look sad.  Are you

                      depressed Guy?  Are you schizophrenic? Is

                      that it?



            No answer.  Hope and Dink exchange a smile.



                                LIZZYBOO

                             (slight southern accent)

                      Maybe Guy is just worried about the

                      international situation.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      It is serious.



                                DINK HECKLER

                      But we're in good hands.



                                LIZZYBOO

                      The Prime Minister is confident.



                                HOPE CLINCH

                      The Prime Minister?



            Sam coughs into his napkin.  O.S. on the monitor Marmaduke's

            raspy breathing worsens.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      Can't bear that noise. Can't we turn him

                      down a bit.



                                HOPE CLINCH

                      No.  I'm listening for the phlegm.



            Sam unscrews the cap off a bottle of pills.  Takes two.

            Swallows them.



                                DINK HECKLER

                      Hope, do you mind if I change somewhere

                      here?  I'm still in my tennis shorts and

                      it's gone awfully cold outside.  The snow

                      appears to be sticking.



                                HOPE CLINCH

                      Change upstairs.



            They leave together.  Sam and Lizzyboo grow uncomfortable as

            they hear O.S. Hope giggling over muffled bits of Dink

            flirting.  Followed by a suspicious sexually charged silence.

            Then a race up the stairs.



                                LIZZYBOO

                      I'll do the dishes.



            Awkwardly, Guy is left there looking incredibly happy.  He

            talks to Sam.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      My wife doesn't love me.  My wife is

                      upstairs betraying me.  How absolutely

                      wonderful.  Well, that's my bedtime then.

                             (he shakes Sam's hand)

                      Pleasure Sam.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Thanks for having me.  Are you going to

                      be alright?



                                GUY CLINCH

                      Absolutely fine.  I think I'll check on

                      Marmaduke.



            Sam watches Guy walk away more broken than he realizes.



            Guy walks down a hallway to the stairs.  Down the stairs.

            Down a hallway.  There's a sense of being lost, in a maze, in

            Guy's life.



            INT. MARMADUKES PADDED CELL ROOM - LATE THAT NIGHT



            C.U. on Marmaduke in bed appearing sweet and beguiling.  It's

            a breakthrough moment.  His first time being still.



            The room is all white, furnitureless, covered in three

            thicknesses of duvet, wall-to-wall, floor to ceiling, and

            ceiling.  Marmaduke's bed is a chest high ledge.



            Guy, steps into the room, beams at Marmaduke with fatherly

            love.



            C.U. from Guy's POV as Marmaduke goes BOFF smashing into

            center screen coming in for a massive headbutt.  Now Guy

            knows what a reverse headbutt feels like.  Guy almost loses

            consciousness.  Blackness flickers.  Marmaduke fades in and

            out, fogs over.



            Tears fall from Guy's eyes.  Marmaduke laughs.  Marmaduke

            reaches out and touches his father's tears.  O.S. a knock on

            the door.



            Lizzyboo shows Keith in and leaves.



            Keith sails in, hair flattened by the rain, tabloid under his

            arm, darts finger held protectively. Guy gains his bearings.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Audi.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      Howdy.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Saab Turbo.  Fuel injection.  Listen.

                      Listen.  I popped round there with some

                      stuff and - Nicola.  Between you and me,

                      it don't look too shrewd.  I mean, you

                      seen them marks on her wrist.  Tried it

                      once.  Might try it again.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      No.  Christ.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Says to me:  "Don't fix that.  Don't fix

                      this.  No point.  What's the point.  No

                      point."  All this.  She's really down.

                      Plays with that little globe thing, with

                      a mopey look in her eye.  I'm just

                      worried she's going to do herself an

                      injury.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      You think?



                                KEITH TALENT

                      I think we know she's showing suicidal

                      tendencies.  Go 'round and see her.  She

                      thinks the world of you.  She goes for

                      you.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      Really.  How do you know?



                                KEITH TALENT

                      It's obvious, innit?  She's been very

                      good to me, she has.  You know:  a really

                      nice lady.  And if she... I'd never...



                                GUY CLINCH

                      Yes of course.  Keith, I couldn't

                      possibly ask you to watch the child for

                      twenty minutes, could I?  It's my shift.

                      Everyone else is off.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Course you can.  Glad to.



            Keith gets down on his haunches, hands raised, snorting and

            sniffing - sparring with Marmaduke.  Marmaduke looks pleased

            with his new friend.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      You are good, Keith.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Yeah, cheers.



            Guy leaves, closes the door on the padded chamber.  Keith

            pushes aside the torn pages of the storybook, spreads out for

            Marmaduke some pages of his Daily Paper, with naked girls and

            huge breasts.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      I bet you won't tear up my paper.  Eh,

                      Marmaduke.  See?  Breasts.  Innit?



            Keith lights a cigarette.  Marmaduke takes it out of his

            mouth.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      No.  Like this.



            He puts the cigarette into Marmaduke's mouth and the child

            learns to puff.  Keith uses the open mouth of a red, stuffed

            animal snake, for an ashtray.  E.C.U. on the ash burning the

            red fake fur of the snake.



            INT. NICOLA'S APARTMENT - NEXT



            E.C.U. on a small bottle of glycerine, Nicola takes the top

            off, dips a tiny brush in it.  A glistening liquid cakes the

            brush.  She brings the brush to her eyes and paints tears on

            her lower lashes, and lines of tears down her cheeks.



            She runs around happy, excited, a cigarette in her mouth, a

            drink in her hand.



            She positions herself standing in a black velvet dress, her

            back to the door, as Guy comes in.  She turns and faces him

            with tears on her cheeks, and a neckline revealing her

            cleavage.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Just an hour ago, I got the most

                      wonderful news.  Enola is alive.  And

                      Little Boy.  They're still in transit

                      somewhere between Kam Kai and Goo Lai.

                      Everything is completely clear.



            She reaches for her lighter.  He stares at her breasts.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      I fly to Burma tomorrow.



            Guy takes her wrist and makes her sit down beside him.  Pats

            her hand.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      But you can't... In my view you aren't

                      allowing yourself to see the truth of

                      what is really happening in Burma.  I've

                      spoken to Greenpeace, Red Cross, United

                      Way workers, and it's very dangerous over

                      there.  You can't imagine.  It's "The

                      Killing Fields" multiplied by a thousand.



            She bites her lip.  He touches her hair, her neck, her

            throat.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      It's unreliable.  A real gamble.  And a

                      lot of money.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Oh I know.  How much do you think?



                                GUY CLINCH

                      Two hundred, no two hundred and fifty

                      thousand.  There are two of them.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Yes, that's more or less the figure I've

                      heard mentioned by my contact in...

                      Tunisia.  Well my flat will go for almost

                      that amount.  And then there's one's

                      jewelry and clothes.  That fridge is

                      nearly brand new.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      Surely, but you can't.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      It won't be enough.  Still.  There are

                      things a woman can do.  Certain things

                      maybe I should do.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      I won't hear of it.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Oh no.  I see your scheme.  Guy, that

                      would be completely out of the question.



            She puts her hand on his thigh.  Hail taps on the skylight.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      My dear one.  No no.  You mustn't.  I

                      couldn't possibly let you lend me so much

                      money.



            Nicola leans into Guy and kisses him. Perfection.



            EXT. KING'S ROAD HOSPITAL - NIGHT



            The building is medieval.



            INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - SAME - NIGHT



            Desperate, Guy  runs and runs down a maze of hallways trying

            to find Marmaduke.  Running scared.  The final hallway is

            decorated with a Peter Pan theme, as is Marmaduke's room and

            the entire children's wing.



                                SAMSON YOUNG (V.O.)

                      Oh God, I can just imagine what Guy is

                      thinking - Nicola is the girl that kissed

                      the man that asked the friend that smoked

                      the fag to mind the kid that lived in the

                      house that Hope built...



            INT. MARMADUKE'S HOSPITAL ROOM PETER PAN WING - SAME



            Guy, in a surgical mask, enters the room.  Stops short.  A

            still and silent Marmaduke wears plastic cuffs attached to

            his hospital bed.  Hope wears a surgical mask bedside.  Hope

            hugs Guy.



                                HOPE CLINCH

                      Guy, with Marmaduke's asthma, now, he

                      can't get air in and he can't get air

                      out.



            C.U. on Marmaduke as he remembers his time spent under

            Keith's care.



            INT. FLASHBACK MARMADUKE'S PADDED CELL ROOM - EVENING



            From Marmaduke's POV with smoke shooting out of his mouth and

            covering the frame.



            He sees pages of the daily paper.  Photos of breasts, several

            large pairs.  His tiny fingertip outlines the nipple.



            A cigarette in his little hand comes into center frame, ash

            reddens, followed by a solid stream of smoke exhaled by the

            child.



            INT. MARMADUKES HOSPITAL ROOM PETER PAN WING - NIGHT



                                HOPE CLINCH

                      Inch-high eczema has broken out across

                      his chest, and is heading for his neck

                      and face.



            Hope weeps.  Guy weeps with her.  Together they, carefully,

            embrace the child.  Guy's eyes wide open.  Then he pats Hope.

            Leaves the room.  Sadly, he closes the door.



            INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - SAME



            Guy steps away from his son's room.  Sam joins him. Guy looks

            guilty.  Sam looks very much the worse for wear.  His illness

            is taking over.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Is Marmaduke okay?



                                GUY CLINCH

                      Yes.  He will be.  We hope.  I've been

                      remiss.  I've made an error.  I shouldn't

                      have left home.  It's horrible.  I, with

                      Nicola, I, I, better just wash my hands

                      of the whole thing.  It will be bearable.

                      I'll give her the money and that'll be

                      the end of it.  We won't touch.  It won't

                      kill me.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Can I help?



                                GUY CLINCH

                      No.  Thank you.  It's so good of you to

                      come.  You've been so kind.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      I value our friendship.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      It means a lot to me Samson.



            Sam looks at Guy.



            INT. NICOLA'S APT - DAY



            Guy's POV- C.U. on Nicola's shoulder, veer off to a

            bookshelf, the carpet, Guy's own huge shoes, his briefcase

            snapping open, the money inside four buff envelopes.

            Everything goes perfectly normally or acceptably except that

            Guy is finding it impossible to meet her eye.



            Guy's POV- Guy's hand places the envelopes on the low coffee

            table.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      I've spent the past two nights in

                      hospital.  My son Marmaduke was very ill,

                      but he'll be fine soon.



                                NICOLA SIX (O.S.)

                      Will you do me the kindness of looking at

                      me when we're talking?



            Guy's POV veers recklessly into the orb of her face, closes

            in on her chin and her lower lip, it swings back to his own

            legs crossing and uncrossing, then to a red wine glass coming

            up to his lips.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      It's given me time for some serious

                      thinking... About us... About Hope.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      I'm sorry to hear that your little boy's

                      been ill.  But I must say I think it's

                      rather tactless of you to bring that up

                      now.  If not downright cruel.  Under the

                      circumstances.



            Guy looks at her bare legs, tennis skirt, backless stretch

            top, girlish socks.  Their eyes lock.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      Under the circumstances?



            She looks up at the skylight as sun pours down on her in a

            pious shaft of light.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      You want to go.  I understand.  Before

                      you go may I say something?  May I...



            His POV of her as his eyes close.  All turns to black.  His

            POV of her as his eyes open.  His attention lands on Nicola

            with her head resting on his knees.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      It's sad, and ridiculous, but I make no

                      apologies, I suppose.  I singled you out

                      for a purpose.  You were to take me out

                      of my life.  Take me to the other side.

                      Through love.  Through sexual love.  But

                      really my plan was deeper than that... I

                      wanted to bear your child.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      But this is too much.  I'm speechless.  I

                      can't breathe, either!  I think it-



            Guy jumps up, looks at the door.  Her bare back turns towards

            him, drenched in sunlight she looks ethereal, immortal.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      No.  Go.  Go at once.  And take your

                      money with you.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      It's yours.  And good luck.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      I can't accept it.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      Why?



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Because it's tainted.



            In a flash, she throws something small at him, throws him

            completely off balance.  She charges for him, money in hand.

            C.U. on her face, an inch away.  C.U. on her hands, her

            wrists restrained in his hands now.  He falls back onto a

            couch.  Nicola C.U. on top of him.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      What did you throw at me?



                                NICOLA SIX

                      A Valium.



            He relaxes.  Removes a wisp of hair from between her lips.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      I only wanted, I hoped to step with you

                      into a world of physical love so that at

                      least we could make a baby after a lot of

                      practice.  One baby from a perfect man.

                      And then you could look in on your little

                      daughter once a week.  I would be

                      content.



            Nicola on top of Guy's obvious erection stretching the limits

            of his trousers.  Her elbow on the base of his erection.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      I'm sorry.  I'm absolutely alright now.

                      Go to your son.  Don't worry.  Goodbye,

                      my love.  Oh, be gone.



            He slides out from under her, corrects himself.



            INT. HAWES AND CURTIS TAILORS' FITTING ROOM - DAY



            Sam stands on a fitting platform in satin pyjamas, robe,

            velvet crested slippers, sleeping cap.  Nicola is stretched

            out on a velvet '30s couch, long legs up, sipping a cup of

            tea.  She is dressed in a conservative utilitarian look.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      You know, I was thinking that I could use

                      something to be buried in.  I would like

                      an open casket.



            Flanked by two TAILORS in three-piece suits, he pretends to

            be dead.  Closes his eyes, lays his hands over his chest.  He

            steps down off the platform and looks at himself in the

            mirror.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      I look like Guy Clinch.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Have you a second choice?



            NEXT:



            Angle on Sam in a tuxedo with tails, top hat, patent leather

            shoes, satin scarf, black coat, can, white gloves.  Sam

            approaches her.  The tailor listens in.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      If you were lying in a coffin, it may be

                      overwhelmingly sad.  In some ways you

                      look too beautiful.  Heartbreakingly

                      beautiful.



            Sam is pleased with her response.  Watches her carefully.

            She senses his eyes on her and blushes.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                             (to tailor)

                      I'll take it.

                             (to Nicola)

                      I wish I knew how much time I have left.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      You've got enough.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Just enough?  Will I finish the novel?



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Yes.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Thank you.  It's better to know.



            EXT. KEITH TALENT'S COUNCIL FLAT - NEXT



            Sam in a black cab talks to Nicola, his shopping bag beside

            her.  The cab stops in front of keith's council flat

            building.  Sam opens the cab window to direct Nicola to

            Keith's building.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Walk up the middle stairway, the elevator

                      is always broken.  It's the first flat on

                      the right on the top floor.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      It's time to wipe the money fear off

                      Keith's face.  And find out what would

                      move him to murder.



            Sam looks down at her stockinged legs.  Her garters just

            barely showing as she bends over to get out of the cab.



            INT. KEITH TALENT'S COUNCIL FLAT THE NEXT DAY - NOON



            Keith's doorbell rattles faultily.  Keith in a robe, braces

            himself and his darts finger for trouble, hides in the

            kitchen, looming large in the small space.  Baby Kim is

            asleep on the bed.  Kath is wandering around picking up toys.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Check it Kath.  In the old days they

                      kicked off by threatening someone's

                      family.  None of this about starting in

                      on a man's darting finger.  How about

                      you, Kath? and Kim?  I can understand you

                      getting it.  Threatening my family would

                      be the right thing to do. Except, it

                      isn't any good if I happen to be with my

                      family - like I am now, innit.



            Kath gets the door.  Keith's front door croaks open.



                                KATH TALENT (O.S.)

                      Yes?



                                FEMALE SOCIALWORKER(O.S.)

                             (Welsh accent)

                      Good afternoon.  I'm your new social

                      worker.  My name's Enola.  Enola Gay.



                                KATH TALENT (O.S.)

                      Where's Mrs. Owens?



                                FEMALE SOCIALWORKER(O.S.)

                      Ah, well, I'm working in conjunction with

                      her.  We'll liaise.



                                KEITH TALENT

                             (to himself)

                      I'll liaise you in a minute.



            Keith moves forward to the edge of the kitchen so that he can

            follow the conversation.  He can see the back of the SOCIAL

            WORKER's brunette head.



                                FEMALE SOCIAL WORKER

                      And is your husband at home at the moment

                      or is it you who's smoking all these

                      cigarettes?



            Keith belches.  The dog barks.  Keith drinks a beer.  Smokes.



                                KATH TALENT

                      He is, yes.  He's not been well.



                                FEMALE SOCIAL WORKER

                      So it would appear.  You're aware, no

                      doubt, of the harm caused by passive

                      smoking?



                                KATH TALENT

                      I smoked passively every day of my life

                      and it never did me any harm.



                                FEMALE SOCIAL WORKER

                      Didn't it?  I'm afraid I might have to

                      see about a hygiene order.



                                KATH TALENT

                      Hygiene?  Listen.  I mean we haven't got

                      what some have.  We're just trying, you

                      know.



                                KEITH TALENT (O.S.)

                      You tell her, Kath.



                                KATH TALENT

                      I mean you come in here-



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Speak your mind, girl.



                                KATH TALENT

                      There's nothing I wouldn't do for my

                      baby.  Nothing.



                                FEMALE SOCIAL WORKER

                      Except you haven't got any money, have

                      you.  You just haven't got enough money

                      for the proper care.



            The dog comes out of the kitchen.



                                FEMALE SOCIAL WORKER

                      My God, the smoke.  And I can't say I

                      like the look of that dog.  Do you abuse

                      your daughter, Mrs. Talent?



                                KATH TALENT

                      Oi!



                                KEITH  TALENT

                      Nobody talks like that about my dog or

                      about my cigarettes.



            Keith, cigarette in his mouth, beer in his hand, comes out of

            the kitchen right up to the social worker, he looks right at

            Nicola Six, dressed for authority, hair pulled back, white

            shirt, tie.  Keith blushes from shame and rage.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Hey.  Hey.  You. Fuck off out of it.



                                KATH TALENT

                      Proper care?  What kind of care do you

                      get from an office?  And from someone

                      like you, doing your hobby or whatever it

                      is you're doing.  Get out.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Tell her Kath.



            The baby wakes up crying.  Kath lifts her baby up.



                                KATH TALENT

                      Get out you evil witch.  Get out.  You

                      vicious thing.



            Nicola speaks directly at Keith.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Well, as I said before, it's nothing more

                      or less than a question of money.



            Nicola leaves.



                                KATH TALENT

                      Vicious.  Purely vicious.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      They can't touch you, girl.  You are who

                      you are.  Don't ever forget it.  You are

                      who you are, girl.  You are who you are.



            EXT. KEITH TALENT'S COUNCIL FLAT - SAME



            With her performance over, like any actress captured between

            stage and dressing room, Nicola appears lost.  She walks down

            flights of steps past non-schoolgoing SCHOOLBOYS and

            SCHOOLGIRLS.  The wind lifts the garbage and the dust up off

            the steps.



            Sam walks up to Nicola.  He smiles at her just barely.  They

            consider talking and stop.  They're mouths open and close.

            His tension builds.  He walks past her up the stairs to

            Keith's.



            Nicola watches him walk away from her.



            Sam approaches Keith's closed door and hears screaming and

            crying inside the apartment.  Sam looks down the stairs at

            Nicola.



            INT. KEITH'S COUNCIL FLAT GOLBORNE RD. - NEXT



            Kath runs out of the flat in tears.  Keith chases her.  Sam

            enters the sun-filled flat through its slightly open door.

            He picks up the angelic baby Kim from off the floor, lays her

            on the sofa.  The low sun strikes her face illuminating a

            bruise on her chin.  He wrenches off Kim's diaper.  White

            light shed on her diaper makes it glow.



                                KIM

                      Ouch!



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Ouch?  Kim.  My God.  So you can talk

                      now, can you?



            C.U. on the right buttock, a bruise round, dark, and grainy.

            C.U. on the left buttock, three cigarette burns, in a

            triangle.  Sam gets up suddenly and bangs into a lamp.  He

            faces the low sun directly.  His POV bleaches out the world

            into a white shock of light as he raves man to God.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      I'll- I don't know what I'll do.  But

                      I'll protect you.  I swear to God I will.

                      Please don't worry.  Please.  My darling.



            INT. NICOLA'S APT - THAT NIGHT



            Nicola stands at the table in the dark room, dark glasses,

            black vulgar nightgown showing her breasts off,  hair free,

            counting large amounts of money, stuffing cash into a

            Harrod's bag..



                                KEITH TALENT

                      You shouldn't've fucking done it, Nick.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Once upon a time, your wife must have

                      been lovely.  How old is she?  And the

                      little girl is divine.  What did you say

                      your dog was called?



                                KEITH TALENT

                      You shouldn't've fucking done it, Nick.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Keith, I understand.  You didn't want me

                      to know, did you. - That you lived like a

                      pig.



                                KEITH TALENT

                             (raising a fist)

                      That's so...that's so out of order.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Yes, well, all is fair in love and war.

                      Do you want to kill me?



            He doesn't get it.  She pours two long glasses of whiskey.

            She drinks.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Have some of this.  I took some of your

                      money and spent it on new stockings and

                      things.  I Hope you don't mind.  You do

                      know why I'm doing this, don't you,

                      Keith?  You do know what this whole thing

                      is really about?



                                KEITH TALENT

                      What?



                                NICOLA SIX

                      It's your darts:  listen.  Your home

                      life, Keith, is stifling your darting

                      talents, and throwing a shadow over your

                      darting future.  It's a question of

                      darting attitude - getting your darting

                      attitude right for the big one.  I

                      already know you'll win your next two

                      matches.  I see it.  You'll be in the

                      Finals up against the world's number one

                      player.  But getting you to believe.

                      That's another thing.  I see you, Keith,

                      as a young boy in the street with your

                      face crushed up against the glass.  But

                      it's not a shop window.  It's a TV

                      screen.  TV stardom.  Keith.  Behind the

                      screen is where you've got to get.

                      That's where all the other stuff is - all

                      the stuff you want.  Let me take you

                      there, Keith.  Let me take you to the

                      other side.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Yeaeaeah.



            Then she uses the remote to turn on a video.  She slides a

            tissue box within his reach.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      I've made a little tape for you, Keith,

                      which in it's curious way will help show

                      you what I mean.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      You're clearly something of a

                      connoisseur, of pornography.  What's your

                      special taste?  Be frank.  I understand.

                      As you know I- I'm quite "non

                      judgemental."



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Same as the next man.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      I see an addiction here.  Is Keith an

                      addict?  Is it on all the time?  Do you

                      ever get enough?  Do you want it on when

                      you are asleep?



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Just nude birds.  Basically.  Obviously.



                                NICOLA SIX

                             (laughing musically)

                      Really, the Englishman's taste!  It's so

                      sweet.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      No danger.



            She turns the plasma monitor on.  Nicola on screen.

            Videotaped in her apartment.  She stands in profile, all but

            naked except for a round plastic hat worn by police, which

            she had purchased from a toy shop.  Keith settles back in his

            chair.



            Meanwhile, Nicola tosses handfuls of the money into a

            Harrod's shopping bag .



            C.U. on the screen as three young MEN dressed as policemen

            walk towards her.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Here comes the filth.  Slow it.



            Snarling, he gets the remote, presses rewind.



            ON SCREEN Nicola's quarter-clad body dashes backward, like a

            dream toy.  Keith freezes the frame of choice.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      That, that is the real thing.

                      Prestigious.



            Keith presses play.



            ON SCREEN Nicola in black elbow-length gloves, blows a kiss,

            beckons with her finger.  She looks soft and sexy.



            His face registers her voice hypnotically.  Colored lights

            reflect onto his face.



                                NICOLA SIX (O.S.)

                      In the books they say, men want to put

                      their faces there.  Return to mother,

                      Keith.  But I don't agree.  I don't think

                      men want to put their faces there.



            C.U. on Nicola's face on the liquid crystal TV screen.



                                NICOLA SIX (CONT'D)

                      I think they want to put their cocks

                      there, Keith.  I think they want to fuck

                      the tits.  Ooh, I bet they do.

INT. NICOLA'S ENTRANCEWAY - LATER



            Keith is all revved up, sexed up.  She gives him the Harrod's

            bag filled with money, a leather bag containing some heavy

            steel tools.  Nicola looks down at her own cleavage, which is

            bursting.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      This ought to cover your problem with the

                      Vig.



                                KEITH  TALENT

                      Righteous.  Nic-ola.  Thanks.  Is it

                      real?



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Spend it.  You bet it's real.



                                KEITH  TALENT

                      Right.  Sorry.  Thanks again.  From the

                      bottom of my heart.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Keith?  Always bring the tool bag with

                      you when you come to see me.  It's a

                      prop.  Your prop.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Now spend the money.  There's lots more:

                      it's all Guy's.  Off you run.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Appreciate it.  Genuinely appreciate it.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      My pleasure.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      And, uh, loyal tape, Nicola.  Quality.

                      They ought to give you an Oscar.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      I see.  Very good Keith.  Clear your mind

                      completely and concentrate on one thing.

                      Which is?



                                KEITH TALENT

                      My darts.  Ton-forty.  Maximum.  Bull

                      check-out.  Sincerity finishing.



            Keith fixes his belt, stuffs a tissue into his pants' front

            pocket.  C.U. on the tassles on his pants' fly swinging.



            Keith walks out and Nicola closes the door.  Keith walks

            downstairs.  He recalls the last bit of Nicola's tape.



                                                           FLASHBACK TO:



            INT. - NICOLA'S VIDEO TAPE - NICOLA'S BEDROOM - AS BEFORE



            At the end of Nicola's video tape as seen off of the TV

            monitor.  Nicola is naked, under the sheets in her own bed,

            smoking a cigarette, speaking into the camera.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Meanwhile, masturbate about me, Keith.

                      Beat off over me.  As a form of training.

                      A lot.  All those things you wanted to do

                      to girls and were too shy to.  Or they

                      wouldn't let you.  Do them to me.  In

                      your head.  It'll be wonderful for your

                      darts.  You'll win.  You'll win.



            The video cuts to black.  Superimpose:  THE END



            EXT. NICOLA'S TOWNHOUSE - SAME



            Keith walks out of Nicola's townhouse.  He checks his bag and

            squeezes the money in his hands.  Happy relieved, amazed, he

            walks into the onslaught of pouring rain.  His hair is

            instantly soaked and his face drips rivers of rainwater.  He

            looks up to the sky.  It pounds out thunder.  Lightning.  He

            walks forward.  Runs.  Runs.  Runs like a madman happy as a

            lunatic.



            EXT. STREET OFF PORTOBELLO ROAD - SAME



            On Portobello Road near the Black Cross, Keith splashes about

            like a stage-drunk, dancing like James Cagney in "Yankee

            Doodle Dandee", in the rain swollen gutter beneath a street

            lamp.  He's laughing and coughing.  Guy, soaked, runs through

            a wall of rain, and a racetrack of thunder.  He stops when he

            sees Keith, soaked, going crazy in the rain.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      Keith?



                                KEITH TALENT

                      ...Yo!



            Keith, with leather bag, sinks against the lamp post.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Oh, mate, you tell me.  What's it all

                      about, eh?  Because I don't fucking get

                      it.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      What?



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Life.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      I don't get it either.



            Keith laughs at Guy.  Guy looks idiotic laughing too.  A red

            Jaguar turns the corner and halts urgently at the lamp.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Here come summer.



            The back door opens.  A voice from the darkness-



                                VOICE

                      Get in the car, Keith.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Cheers, lads.



                                VOICE

                      Get in the fucking car, Keith.



            Guy straightens, bravely, prepared to defend Keith with a

            right hook.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      It's okay Guy.  No, it's okay.  Only

                      messing.



            Keith stoops to get into the car as he calls back to Guy.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      We'll have a drink.  Inna Golgotha.  I'll-



            A hand pulls Keith into the backseat.  None other than Chick

            Purchase the brutal person who had beaten the Asian Man to

            death earlier on in Keith's violent crime days.  Chick

            wearing brass knuckles punches Keith in the stomach.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Ten mimff.  Oof!



            INT. ACTON'S THE MARQUIS OF EDENDERRY - THAT NIGHT



            Nicola and Guy walk through the room towards Keith's table.



            A terraced interior covered in brothely red velvet, tinkling

            chandeliers, eight dart boards in a line, raised oche, mimic

            target, digitalized scoring.  BARMEN in braces and pork chop

            side burns, BARMAIDS in milkmaid outfits with wenchy

            cleavage, SECURITY MEN, stockades of CROWD, and DTV camera

            with host TONY DE TAUNTON.



            Nicola and Guy join Keith's table.  Guy seats Nicola.  Then

            Guys sits beside her next to Sam.  Keith adjusts his position

            jerking with pain from a broken rib.  The trouble with Keith

            tonight is that he is terrified.



            Nicola observes Keith.  Her mind is working faster than a

            silicon chip.  Surrounded by Debbee Kensit, Analiese,

            Petronella, Iqbala, SUTRA and Sam.  Keith wears the Cubans,

            toreador flares, black short sleeved shirt with silverscript:

            Keith Talent - THE FINISHER, and bat-winged darting cape.



            Sam observes Nicola intensely.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                             (to Guy)

                      Keith, is not at his best.  He's

                      terrified of losing.



            Nicola doesn't answer, too busy studying Keith.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      He certainly looks...ready for anything.



                                NICOLA SIX

                             (to Guy and Samson)

                      Doesn't he.  I love the stingray

                      outfit...He looks like the Pied Piper.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      He looks...He looks like Marmaduke.



            Nicola laughs.



            Sam looks Nicola over.  She looks like a million dollars -

            blonde mink coat, diamond earrings, diamond on a gold chain

            around her neck, velvet suit V-necked and split in the back

            of the skirt, sheer stockings, court heels.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      I'm like You fucky Nefner (Hugh Hefner)

                      that's who I'm like.  I have, I have

                      never made no secret of my, my admiration

                      of the, the female charms.  Look at this,

                      Miss Debbee Kensit.  Sixteen today.  On

                      your feet girl.



            Debbee rises up in her tight black shorts, pink leggings up

            her thigh, net T-shirt catches her breasts.  She smiles

            halving her IQ.



            Sam and Nicola exchange a serious look.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      I hope Keith wins.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Oh he'll win.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                             (to Nicola)

                      Nicola, you could have told him why you

                      believe this to be true-



                                NICOLA

                             (looking at Sam)

                      He'll win. I feel it in my tits.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Here comes summer.  Look what the fuckin'

                      cat's dragged in.  Look what's crawled

                      out from under its fuckin' stone.



            Guy and Nicola look up at TRISH SHIRT, a faded blonde ghost

            who stares at Keith with numb yearning.  Trish Shirt sits

            with them.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Trish like a Pint of vodka, is it?

                      Bucket of mephs?  Blimey.  We'll have

                      Kath in here in a minute.



            A SECURITY GUARD comes for Keith.  Keith checks his breast

            pocket for his darts pouch.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Better be going to the dressing-room.

                      Compose my thoughts.  It's not a dressing

                      room, not as such.  The Gents.  They

                      clear the lot of them out.  To allow the

                      two contestants to - to compose their

                      thoughts.  Okay ladies!  Wish me luck!



            The ladies all wish him luck.  Keith nods farewells.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      Best of luck Keith.



            Keith goes quickly into the Gents.  Sam watches Nicola.  She

            follows Keith.  Nicola stands between the Ladies and Gents,

            by the cigarette, condom, hairpiece, prostrate kit,-

            machines.  A MAN in a frilly shirt screams from inside the

            Gents.



                                MAN (O.S.)

                      All out.  Give our contenders some peace

                      before the match.



            This man leaves the Gents.  Nicola enters the Gents.



            INT.  THE GENTS ROOM- SAME



            Keith Talent dabs his face in the basin catches Nicola's eye

            in the mirror.  She lights a cigarette. In the white

            testosterone room a YOUTH leaves a stall, looks at Nicola,

            hesitates, and leaves quickly.  Three men remain - a haggard

            MILKMAN bent over the urinal whinnying with pain as he

            pisses, PAUL GO, the Japanese darting champion tending to his

            darts, and Keith.



            Nicola saunters up to Paul Go, so close that he has to look

            up at her.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Do you speak English?



            Paul Go gives a sudden nod.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      And where are you from?  Japan yes- but

                      Honshu, Kyushu, Shikoku?



                                PAUL GO

                      Honshu.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Tokyo, Kyotu, Nagoya, Yokahama, Nagasaki?



                                PAUL GO

                      Utsonomiya.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Been with us long, have you Paul?  Tell

                      me.  Do you know what I mean by

                      Hiroshima?  What about Enola Gay?



            Paul Go shudders.  C.U. on the black fluff on his upper lip.

            She turns to Keith, her back to Paul.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      It's funny, isn't it darling?  People are

                      always saying that the Japanese are

                      different from us.  From you and me.

                      More different.  More different than the

                      black.  More different than the Jew.

                      More different, even, than that little

                      creature over there.



            Indicating the poor Milkman.  Keith ready to agree.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      We should surely be able to address the

                      matter in a liberal and inquiring frame

                      of mind, I mean, when all is said and

                      done, just how different from us,

                      spiritually, humanly, are these fucking

                      monkeys?



            Paul Go waits, then he smiles.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      And now you're showing those teeth that

                      nobody understands.



            The Man in the frilly shirt reappears.  Nicola clicks her

            heels across the white tile floor walks towards Keith.



                                SAMSON YOUNG (V.O.)

                      With eyes of love, she gives Keith a

                      kiss, and then carefully wipes his mouth

                      with her tissue.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Keith, your shirt!  It must have got a

                      little creased in the car!



            She bends to straighten the rayon.  She bends lower.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      ...On your knees, girl.



            C.U. on her stockinged knees meet the shine of the toilet

            floor.  She wets her finger to collect fluff from his

            trousers.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Win, Keith.  Dispose of the challenge of

                      the - hibakusha.  Come to me tomorrow.

                      I'll have more money for you... You're my

                      God.



            Paul Go moves past them.  The Milkman sets his course for the

            door.  The man in the frilly shirt leaves.  Keith stays and

            nods his head.  She unzips his trousers.



                                SAMSON YOUNG (V.O.)

                      So that was the necessary.



            INT. THE MARQUIS OF EDENDERRY - JUST AFTER THE MATCH



            The Keith Talent party is in full swing.  The Champion -

            Keith joins the blur borne up on the crowd's backs, laughing

            like a god of mobs.  A god of blur.



            SLOW MOTION pan across the Black Cross crowd and Nicola

            clapping solemnly with great emotion.  Sam is the most

            solemn.  Nicola turns to Sam.  Sam stops clapping and turns

            to her.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Every time he wins I keep thinking - The

                      murder.  Your ending.  Could really

                      happen.



            The crowd deposits Keith on the table top.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      And the fairy-tale continues.  The young

                      Jap crapped it.



            Keith yawns.  Trish raises her head from the table and points

            her whole arm at Nicola.  Sam tenses up.



                                TRISH

                      You!  It's you!  Ooh, I saw you.  In the

                      Gents.  She was down on her fuckin' knees

                      in the Gents!  For Keith.  She was down

                      on her knees in the Gents sucking his-



            Keith steps masterfully forward and hits Trish once on the

            cheekbone.  He stands over her, her body unmoving.



            INT. KEITH'S GARAGE - LATER



            Keith with his emptied bottle of porno, stares up at his

            darts board.  Tears of pride fall to his lap.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Another bockle?  Already bit tiggly.

                      That bull finish:  right in the miggle.

                      No diggling, but give Debs a lickle

                      cuggle.  Quick piggle.



            The dart board looks kaleidoscopic.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Nick.  Ola.  She did it.  Did it.  Did

                      it...



            He drunkenly opens his darts notebook. C.U. next to - I beat

            Paul Go.  Nicky said it.  He writes- Got to stop hurting K.



            INT. MARK ASPREY'S KITCHEN - LATER THAT NIGHT



            Sam and Nicola drink scotch.  Mahler is played over the sound

            system piped into the kitchen.  She sits on his kitchen

            counter dangling her legs, reading the novel.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      A chapter of epic squalor.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Yes.  Surprisingly dreadful.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      You know, when Keith hit the madwoman,

                      that was his idea of being gallant.  To

                      me.  Like laying his jacket over a

                      puddle.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Your stockings.  The knees are both torn.



            She touches her legs.  He watches closely.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      I know.  I can't see the point in

                      stockings when they're this sheer.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      That- that was...



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Unforgiveable?  By the way, I've finally

                      put my finger on what I can't bear about

                      Keith.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Which is it?



                                NICOLA SIX

                      He's so working-class.



            He lifts himself up onto another counter, puts his boots on

            the top of the stove.



            Turning serious, she picks the pages up.  Drinks more scotch

            before she speaks.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Sam, it's a, it's a good novel. It's

                      quite beautiful.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      It's got a long way to go.  It's hard

                      because I feel like you want it to

                      happen.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      And you don't?



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Not very much.  I'd rather live if I were

                      you.  And, I'd rather live to write about

                      you.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Unfortunately, that's never going to

                      happen.  Are you in pain?



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Yes.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Take something.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      No.



            The Mahler orchestra swells.  Sam looks frail.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Keith will never be the same.  And Guy.

                      Oh, God.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      I know.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      You're in so much trouble.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Not more than usual.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Not yet?



            She jumps down from the counter and jacks up her skirt,

            showing thigh as she does so.  She turns around to refill her

            drink.  Pulls her skirt down over her bottom.  She turns.

            Walks towards him.



            Sam gets angry.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      I shouldn't be here.  There's so little

                      time- for me to finish the novel.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      I know.  Calm down.



            She looks around the room.  Sam is suffocating.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Nothing you say is true.  What if nothing

                      happens?  Nothing you say has happened.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      This happened.  And I said it would.



            She opens her plastic Chanel shopping bag and shows him.

            Angle on the pile of money inside the bag.



            Sam cheers up.  He looks at her with great relief.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      It's all true?



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Yes.  All of it.



            Sam looks at her in awe.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      So you'd better finish your novel soon.



            Visibly, he switches gears, amps up.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      You don't get it.  I'll finish my novel-



            Grabs his novel.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      - based on your life, when - no, after -

                      your life ends.  That is the ending on

                      the novel.  And that is it.  I will see

                      you die in all your detail.  And then I

                      will go home, and write that ending.

                      Exactly what I saw.  The truth LIVE and

                      nothing but the truth so help me God.

                      Amen.



            Nicola looks at him understanding how serious he's taking

            this.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Right.  I understand.



            EXT. MARBLE ARCH - DAY



            In a crowded rat race intersection Sam walks up to a

            surveillance store.  He looks into the glass windows of

            'Spys' on Marble Arch.  He enters the store.



            INT. SPYS STORE - NEXT



            Sam talks to an older MAN.  Sam stops.  Touches the TV

            surveillance equipment.  A hidden camera, hidden in the TV

            screen of a TV that's turned off, records Sam on video tape.

            Sam looks for the camera, bewildered.  Angle on two inch TV

            screen in Old Man's hand.  C.U. on Sam stroking the TV

            screen.



                                MAN

                      We like to hide our camera in the TV set.

                      There's one in every room.



            Still C.U. on the two inch screen, Nicola joins Sam.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Hello Sam.



            Still C.U. on screen of the two of them as Sam explains

            himself.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      I need to be able to see in.  At all

                      times.  Really.  Or else I can't write on

                      the level that it has to be.  There's so

                      little time left.



            O.S. Nicola looks at him, runs her hand along her fur coat

            unconsciously.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      I feel like I can't catch up.  I can't

                      keep up.  It's all going on and I'm not

                      there.  I'm an unreliable writer.  My

                      mind is going.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      No problem.  Let's buy it and bring it

                      home.  You'll be fine.



            INT. NICOLA'S - NEXT DAY



            Angle on liquid crystal screens hung up in the living room,

            bedroom, extra bedroom.  A tiny camera is loaded up with tape

            by Sam.  C.U. on the tiny camera.  He closes it.  Places it

            inside the TV screen.  100% hidden.  He looks at Nicola.  She

            stops what she's doing and stares into his eyes.  This will

            change her life and she knows it.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      I have to.  I was missing too much.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      I know you do.



            Their moment is suddenly halted when a computer installation

            MAN comes into the room.  This man installs a hook-up to

            Nicola's computer.  Sam and Nicola watch the man connect it.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      I can see it all now on my computer even

                      when I'm not over here.



            INT. MARK ASPREY'S OFFICE LIBRARY



            Another installation MAN turns on Sam's computer monitor.

            Angle on screen as Sam and Nicola appear.  FREEZE FRAME as

            the installation Man leaves the room.  Walks down the

            hallway.  Out of the house front door.



                                                           FLASHBACK TO:



            EXT. NYC SKYLINE PAN AM BLDG - SIX MONTHS AGO - DAY



            Straight up Park Avenue angle on the tall skyscraper.  Angle

            on Dr. Slizzard's office.



            INT. PAN AM BUILDING DR. SLIZARD'S OFFICE NYC - SAME



            Sam is seated on the examining table as the doctor explains.

            Sam's tan and highlighted sun-bleached hair color, seersucker

            suit, a sporty, healthy version of himself.  The floor to

            ceiling window of the room is blocked by a low hanging cloud.

            The doctor gives Sam a grey pill and a paper cup of water.

            Sam drinks it down.



                                DR. SLIZARD

                      Sam.  In about six months the pain will

                      come.  Call me and I'll send you a

                      different group of prescriptions, a

                      special package.  What you do with it is

                      up to you.  If it's unbearable, you may

                      want to -



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      I probably will.  That is then.  Of

                      course.  I still have until then.



                                DR. SLIZARD

                      But first your consciousness will change.

                      Your unconscious may become more

                      prominent due to this disease in

                      conjunction with the meds you're on.  And

                      all of it will appear to be 100% very

                      real.  You won't know.  You'll think

                      you're awake.   One thing's for sure,

                      once the dreams come, the pain won't be

                      far behind.



            INT. MARK ASPREY'S APT FRONT DOOR - NEXT DAY



            A uniformed motorcycle COURIER with helmet on, one piece

            biker leather suit, boots, waits for Sam to sign for his two

            packages.  Sam has a vodka in one hand signs.  He tears open

            the FedEx envelope and pulls out a check.



                                COURIER

                      Could you sign for the second package?



            Sam holds the check up.  Talks to the courier.  Signs for the

            second FedEx package.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      A check from my publisher.  They love

                      Nicola's murder.  You've just delivered

                      me the success I've always wanted.



            Sam opens the second package.  Takes out a medicine bottle.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      And the ending I never asked for.  I

                      suppose I should read the instructions.

                      What if it's the 'pill to end all pills?'



            C.U. on the black bottle marked with a skull and crossbones

            next to Dr. Slizzard's typed out name and the date.



            The courier leaves.  Sam gets an idea and rushes off down the

            hallway to the office library.



            INT. MARK ASPREY'S OFFICE LIBRARY - NEXT



            C.U. on the locked desk drawer.  Sam has a screwdriver

            pointed into the lock and a hammer raised.  He breaks open

            the lock.  It springs open.  He shuffles through the drawer,

            photos. Takes out a bunch of wallet-sized photographs.  His

            eyes widen.  There are four photos of Mark Asprey and Nicola.



            The first is a shot too blurry to discern but it looks like

            Nicola kissing Mark Asprey naked in bed. The second, a C.U.

            on Nicola laughing without make up early in the morning. The

            third, is a shot of Nicola posing in front of an Eastern

            Buddha in a foreign temple. The fourth shows the two of them

            together, his arm around Nicola's waist, caught in a

            paparazzi shot at a party cut out of Tatler Magazine's social

            column.



            Sam looks at the second photograph in his hand of Nicola,

            laughing.



            Sam's mind on medication drifts.



                                                           FLASH CUT TO:



            INT.  SAM'S POV OF SECOND PHOTOGRAPH - A YEAR AGO



            The photo comes alive and Nicola becomes animated. Nicola is

            in Mark's bed naked, laughing. Mark places a breakfast tray

            in front of her with burnt toast, eggs, sausages.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      I won't eat this period. You've burnt

                      everything. You're a miserable cook.



                                MARK ASPREY

                      I made it perfectly well. Eat up.



            Mark lifts up a fork, holding a burnt black sausage and tries

            to get it into her mouth. She and he laugh happily, playing

            with each other lasciviously.



                                                       FLASH CUT BACK TO:



            INT.  MARK ASPREY'S OFFICE LIBRARY - SAME AS BEFORE



            Sam drops the photo's on Mark Asprey's desk top.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Don't want to go there.



            EXT. NICOLA'S ROOFTOP - THAT NIGHT



            With liquor and notepad on big pillows spread out over rugs,

            in candlelight, Sam crawls to Nicola with the photo Mark

            Asprey shot of Nicola.  He tosses the photos onto her lap.

            She takes it in her hand.  Looks at it.  The photo has a

            great effect on her, making her become fragile, soft.  She

            rolls over on her side and turns away from him.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      What kind of camera did Mark Asprey use?

                      One with a time delay?  Or did you employ

                      some sniggering third party?



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Time delay...  I suppose you never went

                      in for any of that.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Actually, no.



                                NICOLA SIX

                             (she tears it up)

                      It was what he was like.  And one will do

                      things for...



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Yes.  Well you did say you were "stupid"

                      for him.  It's over between you two isn't

                      it?



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Some things are never over.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      One thing I can't understand is you

                      relationship with Mark Asprey. Was it a

                      coincident that you dropped off your

                      diary's in front of Mark Asprey's house?

                      Was it all an obvious manipulation?



                                NICOLA SIX

                      I guess that I couldn't think of a more

                      appropriate place than in the trash bin

                      in front of his house. I was giving my

                      life to him until you came along.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Don't lie.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      It's not a lie and you know it.



            Sam's still not convinced.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      And why is it over between you two?



                                NICOLA SIX

                      He gave no explanation. Sometime's you

                      love more than they love.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      So that's why he won't be here for your

                      'horror day'?



                                NICOLA SIX

                      I'll never see him again. When he

                      returns, I'll be gone.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      'Til death do us part.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      And that's in six days.



            She sings to Sam, on her back, bare legs up in the air, with

            a liquor gaze.  In so many ways this is the best of Nicola

            Six, better than anyone.  Angle on her legs dancing in the

            air, toes touching the brightest stars.  She taps out a dance

            in the sky.  Sam wants her.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      "I go out walking, after midnight, in the

                      moonlight, just like we used to do.  I'm always

                      walking, after midnight.  Searching for you."



            Sam smiles.  She rolls onto her belly facing Sam.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Love makes the world go round.  And the

                      world is slowing up.  The world isn't

                      going round as fast as it used to.  Love

                      just doesn't make the world go round

                      anymore.  You see.  Love is dying, it's

                      slowing down and it's dying.  There are

                      signs of it everywhere.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      To work.

                             (takes out his notepad)

                      Can I have the photos back?



            Nicola hesitates.  Sam wants it seriously, tensely.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Please.



            Nicola gives it to him.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Let me have some more on these nature

                      rambles you take Guy on.  These little

                      love parodies - they're among the worst

                      things you do.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      You only have to write them up.  I have

                      to go on them.  I hate walking.  I mean,

                      where to?  It's like being in an ad for

                      love.

INT. FLASHBACK TO WOODS NORTH OF BARNET - DAY



            Against a garrish SILENCE.  Leaves carpet the woods in the

            low sun.  Nicola in green wellies,  patched blue jeans,

            knocks Guy's hat off into a puddle, then runs and hides.  Guy

            scampers after her.  Can't find her.  Finds her as she

            finishes writing - I Love You - with a stick in phlegmy mud.



            INT. NICOLA'S ROOFTOP - LATER



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      I still don't get it.  The Guy-torture.

                      I'm expecting some cool twist.  Oh yeah.

                      It's about time I saw one of those

                      videos.  One of these ads for sex.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      There aren't any.  I don't keep them.  I

                      hate them.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      How very disappointing.  Asprey's snaps

                      are a little out of date.  How am I meant

                      to describe the delights of your body?

                      How can I write about a sack artist?  I'm

                      fucked.



            She reaches for her top button, above the rooftops.  She

            becomes Sam's nude.  They are both speechless.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      How do you feel about me?  The truth.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      The truth?  You're a bad dream, baby.  I

                      keep thinking I'm going to wake up and

                      you'll disappear.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      You don't mean that.  This is more

                      excitement than you've had your whole

                      life.  You know you want me...before you

                      die.  You feel it.  I feel it too.  We

                      both feel more alive on the eve of our

                      death than we've ever felt before.



            Nicola comes towards Sam.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      I love you.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Don't.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Please.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      I can't.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      You must know that it has to happen.

                      I'll fix it.  I'll do it all.



            Angle from above looking down on Nicola and Sam on the

            rooftop.



                                SAMSON YOUNG (V.O.)

                      No.  You'll have to forgive me on this.

                      I'm not telling all.  No gentleman worth

                      his salt would reveal the details of this

                      great event.



            INT. MARK ASPREY'S OFFICE LIBRARY - DAY



            Rain pours down the windows.  Winds whistle by.  The pain-kit

            box open on Sam's lap.  His mind drifts.  On telephone.



            C.U. on bottles of pain medicine labelled:  Shooting,

            Stabbing, Burning, Splitting, Throbbing, Flashing, Dull,

            Heavy, Tiring, Sickening, Cruel, Vicious, Punishing, Killing.

            Sam lifts a black bottle marked by a skull-and-crossbones.

            C.U. on the black bottle and the skull-and-crossbones.  O.S.

            pipes are hissing, a big bang.

                      the modern skull-and-crossbones... Dr.

                      When it comes to the pain classification,

                      we're back in the Middle Ages.  That's

                      for when the living will envy the dead.

                      That's for the most painful condition of

                      all.  Life, my friend.



            INT. NICOLA'S BEDROOM - SAME



            Nicola sits alone on the bed sensing Sam's looking at her.

            She looks into the TV camera hidden behind the TV screen.



            INT. MARK ASPREY'S OFFICE LIBRARY - SAME



            Sam looks over at his computer monitor.  C.U. on Nicola in

            her bedroom alone.  O.S. her doorbell rings.  She gets up.

            Walks out of the bedroom.



            C.U. on his bottle marked by a skull-and-crossbones in Sam's

            hand.  Sam contemplates taking the suicide pill.

            Nicola and Guy in the living room.

            Sam, looking disheveled and ill, watches his computer monitor

            playing live coverage of Nicola and Guy in the living room.

            Sam presses a button and flashcuts to her empty bedroom, and

            flashes back to her living room. Nicola and Guy sit on the

            couch and play the game "Nervous."  Nicola's shirt is taken

            off, her flesh-colored schoolgirl training bra stays on.



            INT. NICOLA'S LIVING ROOM - SAME



                                NICOLA SIX

                      It hasn't been a great success has it.

                      Our first love session.



            Guy places a fist on his heart.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      No, but...in here.



            Nicola sits stiffly beside Guy.  A small book is in her hand.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      I have a book for you.  Would you read

                      it?  For me?



            She gives it to Guy.



                                GUY CLINCH

                             (reads cover)

                      "The Lights of Many Suns."  Is it

                      religious?



                                NICOLA SIX

                      No.  It's just a beautiful story.  It's

                      helped me a lot with Enola Gay.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      I'll read it right away.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Let's try a little game - Nervous.  You

                      put your hand on my body and let it

                      descend until I say nervous.  Or I put my

                      hand on your tummy and move it slowly

                      downwards.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      Until I say nervous?



            Guy's hand starts on her lips and moves to her breasts.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Nervous.  No, go on...not nervous. You

                      can kiss them.



            Guy dips his lips to her breasts still covered in a bra.

            Disturbed but still observant, Sam leans into the computer

            monitor to see better.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Quick.  Let's go to the bedroom.



            Nicola and Guy untangle and walk out of the room.

            Guy lights a cigarette, still keeping an eye on the TV.



            Sam programs his computer.  Sam blows his cigarette smoke

            onto the computer screen.



            ON SCREEN - In Nicola's bedroom, Guy, naked, slides under the

            sheets of her bed.



            Sam watches Guy, closely.



            INT. NICOLA'S BEDROOM - 12:20PM



            Guy, under the sheets, waits for Nicola, his back to the

            camera.  She runs through the doorway and jumps into bed

            wearing her worsted tights, and panties, and no bra.



            C.U. on a set of apartment keys which she throws him.  They

            fly through the air.  He catches them in his hand.



            Guy is pleased.  She kisses him.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      I want you to have the keys to my flat.

                      There's only one thing you'll have to do

                      first.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      What's that?...Leave my wife?



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Oh no.  I don't want you to leave her.

                      What kind of person do you think I am?  I

                      don't want you to leave her.  I just want

                      you to tell her.



            INT. MARK ASPREY'S OFFICE LIBRARY - SAME



            Sam is revolted.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      No!  No! But he can't do that!



            INT. NICOLA'S BEDROOM - NEXT



            Nicola gives him a full on kiss.



            Guy takes off her tights.



            Off they come as she somehow remains modest.  Next her

            panties, plain and unfeminine, come off.



            Her strange panties fly through the air.  Guy makes love to

            her.



            C.U. on her face lying, acting, believable.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Yes. My darling.  How it hurts.  Oh, how

                      it hurts...



            Under the sheets, unrestrained sex.



                                SAMSON YOUNG (V.O.)

                      By 6:15 on the morning of the third day,

                      technically before murder day, she's got

                      five toes on either shoulder, and her

                      lips are all over his face.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Now.  Stop now.  Something's wrong.  You

                      have to tell your parents.  And your

                      wife's too, of course.



            She puts on her strange panties in the morning light.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      I've only got a father, and he's in

                      Ireland.  And Hope's only got a mother,

                      and she's in an institution in Norfolk.



            INT. MARK ASPREY'S OFFICE LIBRARY - SAME



                                SAMSON YOUNG (V.O.)

                      If I were Guy and I knew what I know now;

                      I would kill her.  I wouldn't even wait

                      'til her birthday.



            EXT. NICOLA'S APT. ON THE DEADEND STREET - 7:20 AM



            Long shot - Guy naked stands looking out her window.  Guy's

            POV of street as a dust storm sends dust and loose papers

            flying.  Nicola isn't done yet.



                                NICOLA SIX (O.S.)

                      Then go to Norfolk.  Go to Ireland.  Go

                      to your wife.  Tell them all, each of

                      them in person.



            INT. NICOLA'S BEDROOM - SAME



                                GUY CLINCH

                      I love you.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Darling, I believe you now.  But for how

                      long?



                                GUY CLINCH

                      Forever I should think.



            INT. MARK ASPREY'S OFFICE LIBRARY - SAME



            Sam replays a piece of the sex scene between Nicola and Guy

            on his computer.  It bothers him.



            Sam looks up at the walls of the room and all the awards and

            sashes, and statues, and ribbons, and robes.



            He picks up his computer and leaves it in the hallway.

            Returns to the room.



            He tears apart all of Mark Asprey's awards, breaks and

            smashes, every shred of Mark Asprey's honors.



            EXT. MARK ASPREY'S OFFICE LIBRARY - SAME - EARLY MORNING



            In a repeat of the same shot from the beginning, when she

            left her diaries in the trash can.  Sam looks down on the

            square.



            Nicola walks up to the bench outside Mark Asprey's house and

            sits.  She looks up at the windows of the office/library.



            Sam looks down on her.  Some birds fly past his windows.  She

            waits.  He doesn't invite her up.  She grows sad.  Leaves.



            She walks down the street. She sees the traffic in the street

            ahead. Her eyes fill up with tears.



            INT. GUY'S KITCHEN LANSDOWNE CRESCENT - THE NEXT NIGHT



            C.U. on lamb cutlets - dated, stamped.  Guy, Lizzyboo, and

            Hope all together.  Guy babbles.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      It must be true, all that.  You know,

                      about food and love.  Have you come

                      across the idea?  When food gets too far

                      from love...the preparation of food has

                      to do with love.  Mother's milk.  And

                      when food gets too far from love...

                      there's a breakdown, like a breakdown in

                      communication.  And we all get sick.



            The sisters are listening.  Lizzyboo leaves the room.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      I've got something to say.  It'll sound

                      more dramatic than it really is, I

                      expect.  I think you've got something to

                      say too.



                                SAMSON YOUNG (V.O.)

                      He was about to introduce the fact that

                      Hope had rather sordidly taken a lover in

                      Dink.  The tennis professional, South

                      Africa's number seven.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      I mean, for quite a time it seems to me there's

                      been a need to...redefine our...  All I'm

                      proposing really is an adjustment.  And I do

                      think it's important, very important, vital,

                      really, to be as honest as one can be.  And I

                      don't see why we can't just work this out like

                      two reasonable human beings.  There's someone

                      else.



            INT. GUY'S HOTEL ROOM BAYSWATER ROAD - LATER THAT NIGHT



            Inside an average hotel room.  Guy with fat lip, swelling

            eye, lateral gash across his forehead, clutches a plastic bag

            of undergarments, and shirts.  He opens the mini-bar  C.U. on

            the mini-bottles  Guy's fingers take out all the scotch and

            all the vodka mini-bottles.



            Guy turns to Sam and hands him some of the vodka bottles and

            one of the glasses. They pour themselves a stiff drink.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Is that all she said?



                                GUY CLINCH

                      Yes.  And then she hit me.  Several

                      times.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      I'm so sorry Guy.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      Don't be silly.  It's not your fault.

                      It's really kind of you to come and check

                      on me.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      I just wanted to see how you are.



            Guy agonizes visibly. Sam finishes his drink.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      I've tried Nicola but she's not taking my

                      calls.  She expects me to speak to my

                      family about us.  It's probably going to

                      cause some problems...already has

                      actually.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      If I were you I'd do everything she says.

                      If I had the chance to I would.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      She's such a sweet person.  Remarkable

                      really.



            He looks up with his black eye glistening.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      I'd do anything for her.



            EXT. MENTAL INSTITUTION NORFOLK - NIGHT



            The enormous institution mansion with beautiful estate

            grounds.



            INT. HOPE'S MOTHER'S INSTITUTION NORFOLK - SAME



            Guy moves through palatial parlours, waiting rooms.



            INT. MRS. BROADENER'S INSTITUTION ROOM - SAME



            Pan over a candlelit Celtic lantern, a paper poppy, a photo

            of her husband, Hope, Lizzyboo, and even one of Hope and

            Marmaduke.  Pan over to Hope's MOTHER.   Guy takes Mrs.

            Broadener's hand and sits beside her.  Guy mumbles.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      No everyone's well and they send their

                      love.  I do think, when a family is

                      really close, and everyone loves one

                      another...



            His face covers in tears.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      and they, no matter what, they protect

                      each other.  And it's forever.   And that

                      even when a husband leaves his wife...

                      and spends shares something with

                      another... there is still our... family.



            Suddenly she speaks in an old Southern accent.



                                MRS. BROADENER

                      It's all-



            Guy waits, attentively...



                                MRS. BROADENER

                      -Shit.



            Mrs. Broadener's NURSE enters the room.  She lifts Mrs.

            Broadener off the bed into a wheelchair.  She wheels her out.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      Where are you taking her?  Nurse?



                                NURSE

                      TV room.



            Guy follows them.



            INT. HALLWAY - SAME



            They join other crazy rich people drifting down the hallway

            to the TV room.



            INT. TV ROOM - SAME



            A TV in front of some crazy PEOPLE.  The TV shows a

            government conference room with the world press waiting

            before an empty speaker's podium.



            INT. MARK ASPREY'S LIVING ROOM NOVEMBER 4TH - NIGHT



            Dressed in pajama bottoms, Sam watches TV with his painbox

            nearby.



            INSERT ON TV.  Nuclear weapons sights.



                                NEWSCOMMENTATOR O.S.

                      The delegations leave simultaneously for

                      Paris and Prague- happily the nuclear

                      arms are on hold for now as peaceful

                      negotiations resume. With yet another

                      threatening deadline set for January 10th

                      2003.  All of us are thankful for what is

                      best known now as the non-event- of

                      November 4th, 2002.



            Sam mutes the TV.  He lifts a laptop onto his thighs and

            switches it on to try and find Nicola.



            Flash Cut to Nicola's guest room empty, her living room

            empty, kitchen empty, bedroom where Nicola is there, with

            Keith.



            Sam hates seeing them together. Sam puts the computer on the

            bed.  Takes out his pens and paper pad and starts to write

            with Nicola and Keith on the computer screen nearby.



            ON SCREEN:  In Nicola's bedroom, Keith looks about with an

            inconvenienced expression for the box of paper tissues.

            Nicola looks around the room and still can't find any.



                                KEITH  TALENT

                      Where are the tissues?  Where are they?

                      Eh?



            He wears an open, white, terry robe.  She wears a white

            chiffon baby doll number.  A new dartboard hangs on her wall.

            She turns, reaches under her robe for her white lace panties.

            Gives the panties to Keith.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Use these, we'll put them on your head

                      until you need them.  You can watch

                      through the legholes.  Might look comic

                      on anyone but you, Keith.



            She places the frilly gas mask on his head.



            Keith reclines onto Nicola's bed:  a lengthy procedure.

            Nicola plumps his pillows, pulls off his boots, hands him a

            lager in a pewter tankard engraved "Keith- The Finisher."



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Yeah cheers.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Now, what's this about?



                                KEITH TALENT

                      The integrity of the darts.



            Keith clicks on the TV monitor with her remote to watch a

            video.  Keith looks  through the two leg holes in Nicola's

            lace panties.



            INT. NICOLA'S BEDROOM - SAME



            From Keith's POV through the holes in Nicola's panties, he

            sees Nicola in a porno on screen in black cape, thigh boots,

            and witch's pointy hat.  As she swirls Keith can see her

            legs, hips, haunch.



            Nicola walks over to Keith, takes the remote control.  She

            turns the video off and turns on The Keith Talent

            biodocumentary on Channel 4.



            Nicola joins Keith and perches on Keith's knee.  Nicola

            watches the Keith Talent biodocumentary on television.  Keith

            drinks from his pewter tankard in a state of ecstasy.



                                SAMSON YOUNG (V.O.)

                      On the morning of the international

                      nuclear weapons treaty confrontation

                      deadline, when the whole world is sitting

                      at home watching all the Presidents and

                      Prime Ministers negotiating on and on

                      over the nukes issue on TV; Nicola and

                      Keith? They're watching themselves on TV.

                      Nicola never gave the nukes negotiations

                      much of her attention. That is, not

                      today. November 4th, the day before her

                      murder.  And as for Keith - he's off

                      dreaming.  Watching himself on TV is as

                      close to heaven as he was ever going to

                      get.



            ANGLE on TV.  Keith on an intercom at Nicola's desk.  Nicola

            approaches Keith in T-shirt, jeans, dark glasses with sheets

            of papers which she sets before Keith.  He nods his approval

            and signs some papers.

                      Go-getting Keith Talent is an upcoming

                      merchandiser operating out of London's

                      West Kensington.  The calls come ringing

                      in from Munich and LA.



            Continuing the program - the COMMENTATOR speaks into camera.



                                TONY DE TAUNTON

                      Winning is what it's all about is Keith's

                      byword.  Never far from Keith's side is

                      his trusty girl Friday Nicky with a

                      helping hand.



            Continuing the program inside The Marquis of Edenderry.

            Keith faces the camera.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      I'm basically the sort of Guy who likes

                      to relax with a few drinks with the Guys.

                      Here.  With the best f- (bleep) with the

                      best f- (bleep) with the best support of

                      any pub in London.  Some question my

                      power.  But come Friday I intend to

                      silence the critics.



            Nicola joins Keith in a little wrestle.



            Continuing the program in the carpark.  Nicola and Keith walk

            hand in hand.



                                TONY DE TAUNTON (O.S.)

                      A bachelor, Keith Talent and Nicky have

                      as yet no plans to wed.  But one thing is

                      certain.  Keith Talent is going a long,

                      long way.



            Continuing the program with a C.U. on Chick Purchase.



            Back to Nicola's as Keith switches the TV off.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Ooh, is that Chick Purchase?



                                KEITH TALENT

                      You never play the man.  Play the darts.



            Keith gets up and shoots off a dart or two into the board.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      We came to blows over this bird, Chick's

                      sister.  Charlotte Purchase.  She told

                      him I raped her.  Forced m'self on her

                      like.  She shouldn't 'ave said that.  She

                      could have been getting it from me twice,

                      three times a week.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Her loss really.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      She got angry wit' me cause of my other

                      birds on the side like.  Kath was one of

                      'em.



            EXT. FLASHBACK AT GOLGATHA PUB - YEARS AGO - DAY



            Chick Purchase, the terrifying bully (from the Vig's jaguar

            beating and the Asian woman beating before that) pistol-whips

            Keith to a pulp in broad daylight.



                                KEITH TALENT (V.O.)

                      Got me put up in hospital, as such.



                                SAMSON YOUNG (V.O.)

                      Well there was no coming back from that

                      one.  Chick hates Keith.  And Keith could

                      have loved the guy.



            Kath Talent comes running up to Keith groaning on the ground.



            INT. NICOLA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT - SAME AS BEFORE



                                KEITH TALENT

                      And now tomorrow night him and I have a

                      rendezvous to sort out who's number one

                      once and for all.



            Nicola turns away from Keith, grins like Lady MacBeth.



                                SAMSON YOUNG (V.O.)

                      Assuming that there'd be a fight at the

                      dart's match, Nicola really looked

                      forward to that as a nice bit of

                      entertainment before her murder tomorrow

                      night.  On the eve of the big night it

                      feels like she's got a long way to go

                      before she gets what she wants.



            INT. MARK ASPREY'S LIVING ROOM - SAME



            Sam writes on a pad.  The computer screen sits on the coffee

            table turned on to Nicola in the dark of her bedroom with

            Keith.



            Sam takes another look at the screen and shudders with a wave

            of illness racking his body and pain from seeing Nicola with

            Keith. He is so upset he smashes his computer so that he

            doesn't have to see anymore. His writing pads fall off the

            couch. He's now out of contact with Nicola. Miserable and

            desperate, he dials the phone.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      ...Oh God.



            INT. NICOLA'S BEDROOM - NEXT



            In extreme long shot Keith naked upon Nicola's body, his

            knees on her shoulders, silhouette.  They are a million miles

            away upon a black reflective surface.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Now.  Stop now.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Okay...Shut your eyes and open your

                      mouth.



            The phone rings.  Nicola picks up the phone next to her.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Hello?  Darling?  I was just thinking

                      about you.  And having a rather blinding

                      weep.



            INT. MARK ASPREY'S LIVING ROOM -SAME



            Sam hangs up the phone.



            SUPERIMPOSE OVER BLACK THE HEADING:  HORROR DAY NOVEMBER 5,

            2001



            INT. MARK ASPREY'S APARTMENT NOVEMBER 5 HORROR DAY - 6:30 AM



            Sam lets Nicola into the apartment.  She looks beat, ghostly.

            They hug. Both of them hold on to each other with fierce

            intensity. Outside the sky is a beautiful violet filling the

            apartment windows with color from the sunrise.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Aren't you going to wish me happy

                      birthday?



            He shakes his head no.



            INT. MARK ASPREY'S SHOWER - NEXT



            Nicola showers keeping one hand dry, holding a lit cigarette.

            Drowns herself in the spray.  She sucks on the cigarette.

            Recalling more details.



            Sam is seated on the closed toilet seat watching her, making

            notes.  The textured shower glass conceals Nicola in a

            scrambled image. He strains to see her naked form. She is all

            smoke and screens.



            In the shower Nicola stands in a corner away from the water

            spray speaking trancelike.  She is MUTED.



                                SAMSON YOUNG (V.O.)

                      She starts to tell me about it:  the

                      night of hate.  Her last night with

                      Keith.



            INT. FLASHBACK NICOLA'S BEDROOM - THE NIGHT BEFORE



            Keith fails at sex with Nicola.



            C.U. on a super fast-paced MONTAGE of all the pornos running

            rampant in Keith's mind, including ones of Nicola Six, BLACK

            GIRLS, ASIAN GIRLS, TWINS, TRIPLETS, DWARFS, everything with

            everyone.



            He's on edge as he turns to Nicola.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Pressure of darts.  Tomorrow's the big

                      one.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      You're not to reproach yourself, Keith.

                      It happens to everyone.  Every now and

                      again.  You're a very sensitive man

                      Keith.



            She reaches over and brings an enormous Middle Eastern hookah

            water pipe onto the bed.  She lights it and exhales smoke.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Try some of this hashish.  It may

                      interest you to know, Keith, that the

                      word "assassin" comes from hashish.

                      Assassins - killers.  They used to give

                      the men a good blast of this before they

                      went out to perform their murders.  Have

                      some.



            He smokes the exotic drug.



                                SAMSON YOUNG (V.O.)

                      Everything Keith had ever done to

                      womankind he had done again ten times

                      last night, with her.



            INT. MARK ASPREY'S BATHROOM HORROR DAY - MORNING



            The room's fogged.  Nicola turns the water off, exits the

            shower stall, gathers a towel around her hips, another towel

            around her hair, moist cigarette in her mouth.  Sam looks at

            her with appreciation.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      My better judgement tells me it's Guy

                      who's going to murder you.  I think

                      that's the twist I should be careful of

                      tonight, at the end.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      You think he's the murderer. You think

                      it's going to be him.  You love him,

                      don't you?



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      He says I'm his best friend.  I want you

                      to know I'm going to miss you when you

                      go.



            She just looks at Sam, smiles like she knows something he

            doesn't know.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Don't tell me you don't believe in the

                      after life.  Life after death.



            Then she walks out into the bedroom.

INT. MARK ASPREY'S MIRRORED MASTER BEDROOM - NEXT



            Dressed in a white skin tight minidress and extremely tall

            white heels, Nicola does her hair tousled with glitter.  She

            stands back, reflected and re-reflected in MA's hall of

            mirrors.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      My God, you won't get fifty yards in that

                      outfit.  It's grotesque.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      You look terrible.  Aren't there any

                      pills you can take? (no answer)



            He struggles to say something. The phone rings.  They both

            look at the phone before finally, Sam answers the call.



                                 SAMSON YOUNG

                      Yes.



                                KATH TALENT (O.S.)

                             (sobbing)

                      Saaam....ugh ugh.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Kath.  What happened?  Where are you?

                      (long silence) Where's the baby?



                                KATH TALENT (O.S.)

                      Somewhere else.  The baby- go and get the

                      baby.  I'm a wicked woman Sam.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      You...No you're not.



                                KATH TALENT (O.S.)

                      Then what is it?  Tell me what it is.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      It's just the situation.



            Kath hangs up.  Sam panics.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      What's happened to the child?



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Let's stop it.  I'm losing it.

                      Everywhere there are things I'm not

                      seeing.  How could I get it so wrong?

                      Those bruises.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Kath takes Keith's shit out on the baby.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Kath can't stop.



            They look at each other, knowing that they have lost valuable

            time alone together.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      This is really happening.



            Sam walks out of the master bedroom as his image multiplies

            with each cut in the mirrored bedroom wall.



            Nicola watches him leave.



            Her POV as Sam takes his last step before disappearing out of

            sight. His last reflection leaves the last of the cut

            mirrors.



            INT. GUY'S HOTEL ROOM BAYSWATER NOVEMBER 5 - HORROR DAY



            Guy reads "The Light of Many Suns," drinks Claret, with the

            TV on exhibiting the solar eclipse live.



                                SAMSON YOUNG (V.O.)

                      The book Nicola Six gave Guy was written

                      by Group Captain Leonard Cheshire, VC,

                      OM, DSO, DFC.  The author was one of the

                      two British observers of the atom-bombing

                      of Hiroshima.



                                TV JOURNALIST (O.S.)

                      I'd recommend that you all admire the

                      'diamond ring' effect of the 'third

                      contact.'



            Guy looks outside at the eclipse as the moon's shape fully

            covers the sun, the solar corona is surrounded by

            unforgettable fire.  Beautiful, other worldly.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      Yes, yes, yes-  Like a heavenly

                      engagement ring for Nicola.



            With deep emotion, Guy returns to his book.  C.U. on the

            words on the left of the page is the name - Enola Gay.  C.U.

            further down the page on the name - Little Boy.  Guy reads it

            out loud from the page.



                                GUY CLINCH (V.O.)

                      'Enola Gay' was the plane that flew the

                      mission to Hiroshima.  The pilot named

                      the aircraft after his mother.  He was

                      once her little boy.  He decided to name

                      the atom bomb 'Little Boy', in memory of

                      his mother.  It killed 50,000 people in

                      120 seconds.



            Guy reaches for the trash can, rushes it to his mouth, and

            vomits.  The book falls to the floor. He falls to his knees.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      No.  Oh god, no.  No.

            Sam also on his knees, picks up a crying baby Kim, abandoned

            on the floor. Keith's dog growls at Sam.



            Angle on a box of matches and a cigarette on the table top.



            He dresses the baby and leaves with her in his arms.



            EXT. GOLBORNE ROAD NOVEMBER 5 - ECLIPSE - SUNSET



            Sam carries baby Kim pressed to his shoulder, her eyes look

            back at the Council Estate, the chaos of Guy Fawkes' Day,

            bonfires, exploding firecrackers, cherry bombs, REVELLERS,

            BUMS, HELL RAISERS, and a small BOY with tattered Guy Fawkes

            effigy begging.



                                BOY

                      Penny for the guy?



            Sam turns the baby round and together they look up into the

            eclipse. The 'diamond ring' effect lights up their eyes.



            EXT. GUY CLINCH'S HOUSE LANSDOWNE CRESCENT NOV. 5 - SUNSET



            At the basement door, Sam gives Lizzyboo the baby.  The

            eclipse sparkles blindingly overhead.



            INT. NICOLA'S APT NOV. 5 - NEXT



            Guy unlocks her door. He rushes from livingroom to bedroom,

            searching hopelessly.



            Guy sees the pewter tankard engraved to Keith, the ruin of

            the used bed, the upended ashtray on the pillow, ash and

            butts on the sheets, exotic underwear scattered on the floor,

            empty brandy bottles, the hookah pipe, and Keith's brocaded

            trousers laid out on a chair with his shirt labelled - Keith

            Talent - THE FINISHER.



            Angle on an envelope marked 'Guy' set on the bed's end table.



            Her apartment keys fall out of Guy's trembling hand onto the

            table.



            Guy opens the envelope.  C.U. on a darts ticket and a note:

            'Gone to the darts'  O.S. the telephone rings.



            Guy picks it up. Waits listening.



                                KEITH TALENT (O.S.)

                      Where the fuck a you been?



                                GUY CLINCH

                      ...Guy here.



                                KEITH TALENT (O.S.)

                      ...oh, hello, mate.  She there is she?



                                GUY CLINCH

                      No, she's not here.



                                KEITH TALENT (O.S.)

                      Know when she be back?



                                GUY CLINCH

                      No, I don't know.



                                KEITH TALENT (O.S.)

                      Minge.  Never around when you want them.

                      Always there when you don't.  Okay.  See

                      you later, then, pal.  Yeah well she said

                      you'd want to be there.  As my virtual

                      sponsor.  Helping with the funding like.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      No doubt.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Onna darts.  Cheers.



            EXT. GUY'S HOUSE LANSDOWNE CRESCENT NOV. 5 - SUNSET



            Guy enters the house cautiously.  The eclipsed sun above the

            house more diamond-like than ever.



            INT. GUY'S HOME - SUNSET



            Guy goes up the stairs and turns towards Hope's room.  A calm

            Marmaduke, in full armour medieval costume, stands in the

            eerily quiet hallway.  The light of the eclipse twinkles on

            his armour.



                                HOPE CLINCH (O.S.)

                      Who is it?  Darling?



                                MARMADUKE

                      A man.



                                HOPE CLINCH (O.S.)

                      What man?



                                MARMADUKE

                      ...Daddy.



            Marmaduke steps aside and Guy enters Hope's bedroom.



            INT. HOPE'S BEDROOM - SAME



            Hope is seated on top of the made-up bed.  Guy sits on the

            other side of the bed.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      Where is everyone?



                                HOPE CLINCH

                      All gone.  There's no need.  He's

                      different now.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      What happened?



                                HOPE CLINCH

                      It was quite sudden.  The day after.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      After I left.



            Marmaduke enters, undresses, lays down sword, dagger, pike,

            shield, breastplate, and gauntlets.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      And you?



            Her face expresses the great undertaking it would be, if he

            were ever to return to her. Guy turns away and stares at

            Marmaduke.



            Marmaduke takes off his shin-guards, chainmail slippers,

            tights, underpants, climbs into bed.



                                MARMADUKE

                      Mummy?



                                HOPE CLINCH

                      Yes, darling?



                                MARMADUKE

                      Mummy?  Don't love Daddy...Bye-bye,

                      Daddy.



            He looks from his son to his wife. Guy's heart breaks.  He

            almost doubles over.  He looks outside at the eclipse.



            INT. TELEVISION DARTS COMPETITION STUDIO NOV. 5 - SUNSET



            CREW members move about the fake Darts Pub set.  A sign says:

            NO SMOKING.  Keith and Tony de Taunton look out the window,

            straining to see some of the eclipse.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Where's the pub then?  The venue.  The

                      Chucking Sparrow.



                                TONY DE TAUNTON

                      We use cut-aways and dub the pub later.

                      Right. Chick's here.



            Keith looks down on the carpark below. Chick Purchase enters

            the building dressed like a girl in a shirt with a flounce,

            tight orange trousers, looking sinisterly ridiculous.  JULIAN

            NEAT climbs out of a cream Rolls-Royce.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Who's that with him?



                                TONY DE TAUNTON

                      Julian Neat; agent to the darting stars.



            Nicola comes through the soundstage doors, makes an entrance

            with Chick Purchase.  Nicola hurries forward to Keith.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      What happened?  Did you lose your keys?

                      I saw your darts clothes were still on

                      the chair.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Where you been, girl?



                                NICOLA SIX

                             (flattened up against him)

                      I'll tell you about it later.  Making

                      arrangements.  For us, Keith.



                                TONY DE TAUNTON

                      Break it up, you two.  Come and be

                      friendly.



            They join the others at the semi-circular bar.  Chick clocks

            Nicola as she holds Keith's hand.  He looks her up and down,

            Chick's a slobberer for skirt.



            EXT. DARTS TV STUDIO - SAME



            Guy reaches the studio doors where a WOMAN lurks around.  Her

            face is hidden by the hood of her long, grey coat.



                                HOODED GIRL

                      They're in there.



            Guy moves closer.  Recognizes Trish under the hood.



                                TRISH SHIRT

                      Keith.  And...Nicky.  Now they getting

                      married like.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      I hardly think so.



            She leans forward places a hand on his arm.



                                TRISH SHIRT

                      They are.  It was on the Telly.  Say I'm

                      waiting.  Tell Keith forever in a day

                      like.  I'll always be waiting.



            INT. DARTS STUDIO LOT - NEXT



            Guy's POV as he sees someone who is Nicola but looks

            different from her.  Nicola is seated on a stool at the bar

            surrounded by men.  She laughs with her mouth as long and as

            wide as it goes, as she struggles with the hem of her dress,

            twisting position on the stool.  All the men's eyes on her.



                                SAMSON YOUNG (V.O.)

                      Guy could see a girl in the group round

                      the bar, she looked a lot like Nicola.

                      But she was somebody Guy didn't know.

                      She was even less human than that thing

                      in the hood outside.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      The past is past.  Let's forget any

                      unpleasantness and shake on it.  Fair

                      enough, mate?



                                CHICK PURCHASE

                      Okay.  Tell me something, Keith.  What's

                      a girl like this doing with a little coon

                      like you?



                                KEITH TALENT

                             (to Nicola)

                      See?



                                NICOLA SIX

                      I think that's very unfair, Chick.

                      Keith's very good at darts.



                                TONY DE TAUNTON

                      Okay, you lot.  Pre-match interview.



            Nicola sees Guy and smiles, waves to him like a puppet.  Guy

            crosses the room.  You can see he's still got some hope left.



                                SAMSON YOUNG (V.O.)

                      His hope gathers in him that she would

                      become the woman he knew; but she just

                      goes on getting stranger.  Stranger

                      smile, and stranger eyes.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      Hello.



                                TONY DE TAUNTON

                      Silence.  Oi!



            Nicola pouts a kiss at Guy and presses a finger to her lips.



                                KEITH TALENT

                             (into camera)

                      So, let's hope the bloke, the guy with

                      the, superior technique will, will run

                      out winner against, against the man with

                      the... least equipment.  Dartwise.  At

                      the death.



            Nicola applauds silently, her palms stop in a prayer.



                                CHICK PURCHASE

                      I'm confident, Tony.  Got to be, with

                      those averages.  And- see, Keith and I go

                      back a bit.  And I know he's got this

                      funny habit.  Of bottling it.  At the

                      death.  Frankly, I just hope it's not too

                      one-sided.  For dart's sake.

                      TONY DE TAUNTON

                      Thanks, lads.  Five minutes, yeah?



            Nicola wiggles a finger for Guy to move closer.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Darling, don't worry- this is only a

                      dream.



                                SAMSON YOUNG (V.O.)

                      Keith's heart jolts when he sees Kim

                      Twemlow, the ex-world number one.  He is

                      like a god to Keith.



            SLOW MOTION SEQUENCE:  Keith's eyes open, sees Kim Twemlow.

            Keith closes his eyes, -turn to blackness-  Keith's POV sees

            Guy near Nicola.  Closes his eyes, -turn to blackness- ,

            Keith opens his eyes sees Chick Purchase next to Nicola who

            laughs widely.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      You're going back with me.



            All the attention shifts fast in one SWISH PAN to Guy.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      You're going back with me.



            Nicola acts shocked.  Guy seizes her wrists, she shrieks, her

            stool slips.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      It's over.  Don't be a prick.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      You're going back with me.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      No I'm not.  What for?  To talk about

                      love, and Enola Gay?  No I'm not.  I'm

                      not going back with you.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Right.  She's going back with me.  For

                      more of what she got last night.  She's

                      going back with me.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      No I'm not.  No way.  Innit.  I'm not

                      going back with you.



            She looks at each of the men. They all wait.  Guy, Keith,

            Chick, Kim, Tony.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      I'm going back with him.



            She places her hand on the crotch of Chick Purchase.



            Guy leaves.  Keith sees Guy walk away. Keith turns back to

            Nicola, he's glued to the spot burning mad.



            THE DARTS COMPETITION - NEXT



            Keith stands at the oche, weak as a kitten, lost.  He throws

            a dart O.S. Keith's heart beats weakly.  SLOW MOTION E.C.U.

            tracking the dart towards the board like a missile, it

            appears to be heading for the bull's eye.  O.S. Keith

            inhales.  The dart hits the steel line around the bull's eye.

            E.C.U. the tip 'pings' against the metal.  The dart is

            repelled from the board and is flung onto the ground.  O.S.

            Keith's heart skips a beat.



            SWISH PAN from the fallen dart to Nicola laughing with Kim

            Twemlow.



            Chick Purchase unceremoniously throws a dart.  O.S. Keith

            coughs against his weak heartbeat.  SLOW MOTION following the

            dart 'til it lands in the bull's-eye.  The scoreboard lights

            up triple 20's.



            Keith sweating and pale concentrates, throws his dart.  SLOW

            MOTION flying with the dart as it heads for double 19's and

            yet lands with a thump on 3.



            O.S. Keith inhales deeply long and hard.



            O.S. His heart is racing. He pulls a beer up to his mouth and

            inhales the pint.



            SWISH PAN to Nicola throwing a kiss with tongue to Chick

            Purchase.



            O.S. Keith's heartbeat quickens.



            Chick throws, scores another SLOW-MOTION bull's-eye.  Chick

            wins.  He waves into the camera victorious.



            SWISH PAN to SLOW-MOTION Nicola jumps up, breasts bouncing

            magnificently.



            O.S. Keith's heartbeat stops.  His breathing stops.  Silence.



                                                            CUT TO BLACK



            INT. DARTS SOUNDSTAGE NOVEMBER 5 AFTER THE MATCH - LATER



            A camera light shines into center frame creating a similar

            effect to the eclipse - a symphony of flares, rings, and

            horizontal bars of glaring light.



            OPPOSITE ANGLE on Keith Talent burning away in camera light,

            red pupils, like a bunny caught in the lights.



                                KEITH  TALENT

                      Tonight's been a valuable experience for

                      me.  Because how's your darts going to

                      mature, Malcolm, if you don't learn?



            A light behind Keith switches on, flares like a corolla

            forming rings around him.  Nicola appears behind Keith,

            visible only in a vortex of unlit space.



            From Keith's POV ANGLE ON a barely visible, bleached out,

            Tony de Taunton, it's hard to adjust to these lights.



                                TONY DE TAUNTON

                      That's the right attitude Keith.



            From Keith's POV, Keith is blind; except for seeing these

            magical flares, and hypnotic spheres he sees, looking

            directly into the camera light.



                                KEITH  TALENT

                      Because she's dead.  Believe it.  You

                      know what she is, Tony?  She's a fuckin'

                      organ donor.  Do that and live?  No

                      danger.  She's history, mate.  You

                      hearing me?



            The crew turns the camera lights out.  Keith's eyes well up

            with tears.  Keith's POV blurry, struggling with his

            blindness from the lights.  Chick Purchase appears behind

            Tony.  It's black and white except for flares of colors.



                                CHICK PURCHASE

                      Anything you say Keith.



            Chick Purchase steps forward.  Chick picks up a light and

            hits Keith up along the side of his head.  Keith has trouble

            standing.  Suddenly ALL the lights go out - power failure.

            The TV CREW squeal, switching switches on and off.  Chick

            hits him again with the light.  Suddenly all the lights go

            on, including the light in Chick's hand.  Chick attacks

            Keith.  The light drops onto the ground, spins on the floor.



            Keith is knocked out cold.



            Nicola knows it's time to walk away.  She takes one look back

            at Keith.



            Angle on Keith badly beaten- his eyes opening.  His distorted

            POV - he sees her.



                                                         CUT TO BLACK.



            The lights go back on. Nicola knows it's time to walk away.

            Takes one look back. Panics. Keith is gone.



            She walks away quickly.



            EXT. CARPARK NOVEMBER 5, 2001 - NIGHT



            Guy's tear-stained face waits in the driver's seat of one of

            his large black cars, the exact one in Nicola's premonition.

            He sits next to a tire iron.



            In the rearview mirror, Guy sees a black cab pull up and

            halt. Sam steps out of the cab, walks up to Guy's black car.



            Sam leans into the window.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Get out of the car Guy.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      Look what she's done to me.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      We're all crying now, from here on in.



            INT. DARTS STUDIO STAIRWAY - NIGHT



            Nicola walks downstairs towards her fate.  At the bottom of

            the stairs, she hesitates at the door.  She opens the door to

            the outside.  Guy and she exchange a look.  She blows him a

            kiss, making you think she doesn't think anything of him.



            She looks around, searching, disappointed that the black car

            isn't there and that no one is there yet.  She steps outside.



            To her right Guy's black car turns on his headlights flooding

            her.  She is all but whited out as she walks into the car

            lights.



                                MALE VOICE (O.S.)

                      Get in.



            He repeats the line.



                                MALE VOICE (O.S.)

                      Get in.



            Nicola's POV of tire iron on his lap.



                                MALE VOICE (O.S.)

                      Get in.



            Nicola leans forward and looks into Samson's face.



                                NICOLA SIX

                             (with intense recognition)

                      You.  It always had to be you.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Get in.



            Nicola gets into the car, sits down. Sam starts to drive away

            slowly.



            INT. BLACK CAR - NOV. 5 - NIGHT



            Nicola can see Chick over Sam's shoulder staring at her from

            the doorway of the studio.  She focuses on Sam.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      I'm so cold.  I'm so cold.  Please.  It's

                      all right to do it...it's all right. This

                      is the way I wanted it to be. This is the

                      way it should be.



            EXT. BLACK CAR - HORROR NIGHT - SAME



            The large black car drives away.  Dead serious.



            INT. MARK ASPREY'S BEDROOM - MORNING



            Sam lays in bed, drinks down the black pill marked by the

            skull and crossbones.  His novel 'London Fields' is beside

            him with a letter addressed to Mark Asprey.



            Time lapses.  Sam's body moves.  Daylight arrives.  Sam has

            passed away.  O.S. birds chirp.



            Mark Asprey in travel attire, puts down his briefcase, sees

            Sam's blue white dead body.  Walks to the bed.  Studies Sam's

            face.  He realizes Sam is dead.  Closes Sam's eyes.  Reaches

            over, lifts up the novel and the letter. C.U. on the letter.



            NOV. 5, 2002



                                SAMSON YOUNG (V.O.)

                      Dear MA, I apologize for the mess- the

                      confusions, the violations, the unwanted

                      fingerprints, the blood.  You might care

                      to look at the novel I left on the table,

                      and the dead body in the car.   P.S.

                      Thank you for introducing me to Nicola

                      Six.  Did you plan all of this?



            Mark Asprey lifts the manuscript up and reads the title page.

            C.U. on the page which reads: London Field's by Samson Young.



            EXT. FLASHBACK AERIAL SHOT OF MARK ASPREY'S ROOFTOP - NIGHT



            As seen from above, from up high, we see Sam and Nicola

            naked, wrapped in each other's arms.  SLOWLY, we go further

            and further away into the sky.



            O.S. Nicola laughs.  She sings her song laying on her back on

            the rooftop, her legs dancing in the air.  Angle on her toes

            touching the stars of the constellations, tapping out a dance

            in the sky.



                                NICOLA SIX (O.S.)

                      I go out walking, after midnight, out in

                      the moonlight, just like we used to do.

                      I'm always walking, after midnight,

                      searching for you.



                                SAMSON YOUNG (V.O.)

                      The night I spent making love with Nicola

                      was the happiest I've ever been on Earth.

                      When you meet your match, it is as if

                      nothing else matters in this world.  If

                      anyone tells you differently, they're

                      lying.



                                THE END



            EXT. FANTASY POOL PORNO IN L.A. - DAY



            C.U. on the top of Keith's head diving through the pool water

            into center screen.  Keith surfaces above water.



                                SAMSON YOUNG (V.O.)

                      In the days after meeting Nicola Six, her

                      image began to work on Keith's mind.  It

                      worked like television.



            Keith lifts himself out of the pool, exposing his black g

            string swimsuit.  He lays down dripping on a deck chair.



                                SAMSON YOUNG (V.O.)

                      He thought of her often.  Although

                      frankly, many of these thoughts were

                      pornographic.



             Nicola mixes a drink at a wetbar.



                                KEITH TALENT (V.O.)

                      But class porn, you know- not like the

                      rubbish you normally get.



            Keith looks over at Nicola as she walks past in bikini and

            high heels, brings him a drink and gently tousles his hair.

            With his bare hands he tears apart each thin strip of her

            bikini off the top of her thighs, snapping her bikini bottoms

            off into his hands.



                                KEITH TALENT (V.O.)

                      L.A. Innit.



            EXT. COST CHECK LIQUOR STORE LADBROKE GROVE - DARTS NIGHT -

            LATER



            Keith takes Clive along the road, the windstorm in his eyes.

            A rather theatrical, tall WOMAN, with full breasts, the thick

            calves that Keith likes, approaches while Clive pisses.



                                ANALIESE FURNISH

                      Are you television's Rick Purist?  Rick

                      Purist, of TV quiz-show fame?



            He looks at her heaving chest going up and down.



                                KEITH TALENT

                             (slurr)

                      Yeah, I am indeed television's Rick

                      Purist.



            INT.  WEST HAMPSTEAD BEDSIT - LATER



            Analiese in bed, Keith leadenly climbs back into his

            trousers.  One look back, then he goes.



            INT. DEBBEE KENSIT'S FLAT - DARTS NIGHT - LATER



            Upon a small bed, in a small room, Keith separates from the

            extremely young, dark-black-skinned, plump legged, thick

            calved DEBBEE KENSIT.  They are surrounded by paintings on

            the wall of Cinderella and Snow White.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Tell your mum.  No, forget it.  Don't

                      tell your mum.



            The wind blows a tree against her window.



                                SAMSON YOUNG (V.O.)

                      How do you account for Keith's way with

                      women, such as it was?  What was Keith's

                      talent?  On the other hand, how much of a

                      knack was it?  One was drunk, one was

                      nuts, and one may have been fifteen.  A

                      real Lady Killer.



            INT. MINI - NEXT



            Keith spreads his hands out in front on the dashboard.



                                SAMSON YOUNG (V.O.)

                      It doesn't take Keith's brain much time

                      to go over all the financial

                      possibilities he can call on for help.

                      Because he has none.  Only one strange

                      long shot - which he locks into.  Nicola

                      Six.



            Traffic lights shed colors over his hands, red, yellow and

            now green.



                                NICOLA SIX (V.O.)

                      Why should he have all the money?

EXT. MIDDLE EASTERN DESERT - DAY



            Huge mountains of sand stand up to desert winds.  A prayer

            chant echoes over the surreal landscape.  Off in the distance

            like a mirage is a palace.



            FAST MOTION SEQUENCE:  Guy enters London's oldest bank in the

            city financial district where there are MEN in bowler hats

            and buildings with marble columns.  Guy walks with a BANKER

            in bowler hat and tails to the vault downstairs.  The

            carpeting and the silver wallpaper in the vault were made in

            the '60s.  Guy and his banker unlock a box.  Guy opens the

            box alone in a small purple velvet room.  Inside the box is

            full of money neatly labelled in 10,000 pound plastic

            packets.  He counts out twenty-five packets, loads them into

            envelopes.  END FAST MOTION SEQUENCE.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      I got the money.  Let me give it 'ya.

                      Ugh.  TAKE IT!  'Ave a look.  I'm good

                      for it...



            Ashley grabs the bag from Keith, opens it.



                                ASHLEY ROYALE

                      Looks sweet.  Calm down Chick.  'E's done

                      alright.  True blue 'e is.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      When did you become such an expert on

                      sex?



                                NICOLA SIX

                      When I was fifteen and a half.



            EXT. NICOLA'S DEADEND STREET - LATE THAT NIGHT



            Keith waits in his Chevy Cavalier, double-parked illegally,

            looking up at her darkened flat.  Still dressed in the darts

            outfit, tears roll down his face, he sniffs, coughs.  He

            turns to his dog.  Bares his soul.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      All that money on the table like, like TV

                      as such.  Magic.  A whole new life now.

                      She's the only one that understands my

                      darts.   And then that video.  That's

                      profoundly moving.  That girl is a sort

                      of sex genius as such.  Makes the hairs

                      stand on the back of my neck.



            E.C.U. on hairs rising up on his neck.  His fingers flatten

            the hairs.  Keith punches the steering wheel.



            In a series of Jump Cuts - Grimly he fingers the faulty

            vacuum cleaner.  The tube of the Hoover becomes a maddened

            python in his grasp.  He peers into the blocked waste

            disposer, it shoots glop into his face.  Manhandles the

            hingeless ironing board, like the man in the deck-chair joke.

            Except worse because Keith is also mindful of protecting his

            darts finger.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      I had high hopes of the relationship with

                      this posh skirt Miranda;  a car, maybe, a

                      cash gift - or at least a loan.  And -

                      okay - things were taken - and it looked

                      bad for a minute there when they formed

                      that queue behind me.  But to scream so

                      loud the neighbors called the filth in -

                      that's betrayal.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      Betrayal?



            Betrayal sinks into Guy's face.



            EXT.  NOTTING HILL PAY PHONE - SAME



            The bag lady walks up to the phone booth and shows Guy her

            exposed breast.

            INT. CLINCH HOUSE HOPE'S BEDROOM NEXT - THAT NIGHT



            Guy brings Hope's martini to her at her dressing table.

            Standing behind her, he moves her hair off to one shoulder,

            and kisses the back of her exposed neck.  His hair is wet.  A

            drop falls from a strand of bangs, lands on her neck.  He

            wipes it away quickly.  She pats his cheek.



                                HOPE CLINCH

                      Tough day?



                                GUY CLINCH

                      Not really.



                                HOPE CLINCH

                      Poor you.  Dinner will be ready in half

                      an hour.  Could you zip me up please.



            He zips up her dress, closing the hook into the eye.



            C.U. on Keith's face emotional beyond belief.  Keith turns

            and stares Sam in the eye.  Sam's right in there with Keith.

            The 'artist extraordinaire' of the dart world.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Go on to tell me everything you know

                      about the game.  I've got fifteen

                      seconds.



                                KEITH  TALENT

                      THE SINCERITY OF THE DART, THE ADDRESS OF

                      THE BOARD, GRACING THE OCHE, CLINICISM.

                      7 feet 9 1/2 inches from the board, 'as

                      decided by the Darts Federation.'  Weight

                      on front foot; head still; nice follow

                      through.  (whispering direly)  You're

                      looking at that treble 20.  Nothing else

                      exists.  Nothing.



            Sam's first dart hits the double 3.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Insincere dart.



            Sam's second dart smacks into the wall cabinet.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      No clinicism.



            The tail of Sam's third dart jabs his eye on the backswing.



            Sam throws a fast succession of darts landing on 11, 2, 9; 4,

            17 outer bull's-eye (25!); 7, 13, 5.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Junkie slime.  Move it.  Move it.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      When I was your age I was still dodging

                      the shit in the South Bronx.  Rats were

                      this big.

                             (showing 12 inches between

                              his hands)

                      You'd come out of the walk-up and see the

                      body of a child, like a broken Cabbage

                      Patch Doll.

            Keith studies Guy.  Keith's mind ticks loudly.

                      Is he rich?...There's a thing you and I

                      might do together.  A money thing.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      I could sell her to you.  Maybe then

                      you'd get some.  Just a joke mate.  We

                      know she's not for sale.



            Amidst O.S. bullets, the Priest speaks on the phone.

                      At first, Keith clearly thinks - as he is

                      meant to - that she is sunbathing in her

                      underwear.  Then he makes out the silk

            Sam types into his laptop.  C.U. on laptop screen words --

            Although she hates bikinis, she had bought it that morning;

            and it is exceptionally vulgar.



                                SAMSON YOUNG (V.O.)

                      I find myself indulging vulgar reveries

                      of a movie sale.  With characters like

                      these any one of them could win an

                      Academy Award.  The only difficulty is

                      casting Marmaduke.  Maybe you could

                      dispense with an infant star and go with

                      a little robot or even some kind of high

                      tech cartoon.  It's amazing what they can

                      do.  Or, because age and time have gone

                      so wrong now, why not a youthful dwarf,

                      wearing diaper and baby mask?  Maybe

                      Marmaduke will get Best Supporting Actor.

                      Get out of the car, Guy.  I'll do it.

                      Please.  Let me be the one.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      Jesus, Sam, don't do this for me.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Isn't it always someone else?  Who does

                      it?



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      The story isn't over, but the life

                      obviously is.

                      you'll be going.

            Sam turns his back on her and pretends to stare at some

            clothes in a Men's Store.



            Nicola disappears into an old five star restaurant.  A DRIVER

            opens the door of his towncar in front of the restaurant.

            Guy steps out.  Walks into the restaurant.

            Sam leaves Nicola's apartment closing the door, careful not

            to make a sound.  He waits, watching Keith disappear, out of

            sight on the stairwell.



            Guy walks up a flight alone.  Sam approaches him heading down

            the stairs.

                      Very well.  Hope said she called to

                      invite you for dinner.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Yes, yes she did.  Thank you.  I'll see

                      you there.



            She purposely messes up her bed so that when she leaves the

            bedroom she's looking as unkempt as her bed.  The door open

                      Makes me randier and randier.

                             (looks at her)

                      And you're a solid second choice girl.



            TRISH SHIRT on her knees.  She's bright blonde, thin body,

            but with the thick sturdy legs Keith likes on all his girls.

            Keith, wearing his darts outfit, zips up.  Leaves.  His dog

            Clive walks out two steps behind.

                      of niceness, friendliness, and that it is

                      important that he is capable of love.

                      Love would be necessary for her grand

            She sits down.  Notices the photo of the Shah of Iran behind

            Keith.



            INT. RETREAT FROM KABUL IRANIAN RESTAURANT - LATER



            At the end of their meal.  Surrounded by huge serving plates.



            Nicola goes off in her own imaginative world, telling a total

            fabrication.



            He stares into the tiny water fountain on top of their table.



                                NICOLA SIX (O.S.)

                      Fifty thousand pounds, Keith.



            Keith looks up at her.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      For one night with the Shah of Iran.  The

                      Shah is the King, Keith.



            Keith has no patience for Nicola now.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      The towel-head.  That's a lot of money-

                      which brings something to mind.  I want-

                      I need-



            She cuts him off, seizing control.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      The wide world was his brothel.  You have

                      to think:  how did he dare.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Ancient privilege as such.  A right

                      exercised from time immemorial.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Very good.  Time immemorial?  No, Keith.

                      The Shah's father was just a Corporal in

                      the army before he made his coup.  The

                      purest skum Keith.  The Peacock was born

                      a pauper.  You see what I'm saying?



            Keith pushes the plate of hot curry food away.  His mouth

            opens, exhaling smoke.



            Nicola opens a packet of sugar, pours a line on the

            tablecloth.  Keith's darts finger moves out of the way.  She

            runs her finger separating the sugar into two long lines.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Two lines of the finest cocaine.  And the

                      most miraculous underwear.



            Keith is interested.



                                KEITH  TALENT

                      What kind of knickers?



            Keith lights a cigarette.  He shifts uneasily on his chair,

            fixes his pants, underwear, etc.  She tells her story as

            sexily as is humanly possible.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Panties, worth a fortune.  They didn't

                      weigh anything.  When the Shah eventually

                      removed the panties he threw them with

                      gusto high towards the domed ceiling.



            INT. THE SHAH'S PALACE - DAY



            Angle up towards the tall, vast, domed ceiling as the

            underwear floats downward.



                                NICOLA SIX (O.S.)

                      The panties hovered in the warm thermals

                      and fell like an autumn leaf.  When he

                      finished they were still falling and His

                      Excellency took his time.



            INT. KABUL RESTAURANT - AS BEFORE



                                NICOLA SIX

                      The Shah never slept with the same whore

                      twice.  But he did look in the next

                      morning and used me rather brutally on

                      the way to a meeting with his American

                      advisors.



                                                           FLASHBACK TO:



            INT. MARK ASPREY'S FRONT DOOR - NEXT DAY



            A uniformed COURIER hands Sam two FedEx envelopes.  Sam reads

            the first envelope.  C.U. on - Sender - Dr. Slizard.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                             (to the FedEx guy)

                      He's speeding up my medication.

                      Deliveries twice a week, can't be good.



                                COURIER

                      Sign here please, sir.



            Too anxious to wait, Sam opens the second FedEx.



            C.U. on the second sender's information:  Missy Harter

            Literary Agency.  Empties the contents.  A check falls into

            his hands.  The courier pushes the signature pad at Sam.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      A check.  Option-money.  I don't know how

                      she worked it.  She must love Nicola's

                      murder story.  But this...check, this is

                      true felicity.  Joy!



            Sam signs his name on the courier's pad.



            INT. SAM'S FANTASY STUDIO SOUNDSTAGE HOLLYWOOD - DAY



            A hundred CREW all over the vast soundstage designed to be

            Nicola's apt.  Pan across the labelled folding chairs

            reserved for each star, their backs to camera, dressed in

            wardrobe - NICOLA SIX, GUY CLINCH, KEITH TALENT.



            Pan across to a canvas crib labelled - Marmaduke.  Zoom

            closer cautiously (mimicking the last shot of "Rosemary's

            Baby") as a BABY star's foot kicks the air devilishly.  His

            crib rocks significantly.



                                SAMSON YOUNG (V.O.)

                      Nicola had the gift.  A sensitivity to

                      know her destiny.  An insight into the

                      events in her life.  It's something she

                      was born with.  Never asked for it.  And

                      was burdened with it.  Imagine knowing

                      the events of your life before you

                      actually live them.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      why should he have all the money?



                                NICOLA SIX

                      It's time to wipe the money fear off his

                      face, and find out what would move him to

                      murder.



            Sam waits, then leaves the house alone.



            EXT. CLINCH HOUSE - SAME



            Sam walks out of the house, down the steps, across the

            enclosed front garden, and out the creaking gate.



            Sam walks away from Guy's with the weight of the world on his

            shoulder.  He looks up at a starry sky.



            INT. MARK ASPREY'S OFFICE - SAME



            Sam types onto his laptop.



            C.U. on the words as he reads them aloud.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                       - Then she kisses him.  She kisses him

                      so delicately vulverable fragile like a

                      Wounded Bird.  It's ten days to countdown

                      and she's given him that kiss, the

                      Wounded Bird.  Risky.  But brilliant.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      I'm moving from New York City to London.

                      And, no amount of political controversy

                      can keep me from reaching my final

                      destination.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Your President was given a deadline to

                      sign of November 4th.  That's one day

                      before my birthday.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      You worried you'll be upstaged?



                                NICOLA SIX

                      No.  I've thought about it.  But no.  I

                      don't see a mini nuclear war starting

                      just then.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Do you want to hear the latest about

                      Keith?  What I overheard.  This may

                      interest you.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      I look at you, and I see a man, who'd be

                      proud to die with his Johnson in his

                      hand.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Yeah cheers, Nick.  Ola.



            She sits beside him on the sofa, moves the tissue box forward

            within his reach.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      I'm going to have a bath.  Would you

                      unzip me?  It's the little catch at the

                      top.  That's it.  Thank you.  I'll be in

                      the tub, oh, for at least fifteen

                      minutes.  There are some paper tissues on

                      the table here.  And a porno on the

                      screen there.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      You know, I was thinking that I could use

                      something to be buried in.  I would like

                      an open casket.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Really?



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Yes.  I have definite ideas.



            INT. HAWES AND CURTIS - FITTING ROOM - NEXT



            Nicola is stretched out on a velvet '30s couch, long legs up,

            sipping a cup of tea.



            Sam stands on a fitting platform in satin pyjamas, robe,

            velvet crested slippers, sleeping cap.  Flanked by two

            TAILORS in three-piece suits, he pretends to be dead.  Closes

            his eyes, lays his hands over his chest.  He steps down off

            the platform and looks at himself in the mirror.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      I look like Guy Clinch.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Have you a second choice?



            Angle on Sam in a tuxedo with tails, top hat, patent leather

            shoes, satin scarf, black coat, can, white gloves.  Sam

            approaches her.  The tailor listens in.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      If you were lying in a coffin, it may be

                      overwhelmingly sad.  In some ways you

                      look too beautiful.  Heartbreakingly

                      beautiful.



            Sam is pleased with her response.  Watches her carefully.

            She senses his eyes on her and blushes.



            LATER:  Sam is being fitted into a black pinstripe, three

            piece suit.  The Tailor closes the buttons on the vest, the

            jacket.  Sam looks in the mirror.  Somehow they all know,

            even the Tailor, that this is the suit he will be buried in.

            Sam is sobered by the experience.  It's perfect to the inch.

            They step aside, wait for approval.



            Sam turns to the mirror.  Sees himself.  Looks into his face.

            Going closer in on his face.  Ending up C.U. on his eyes.

            C.U. on his eyes looking into their mirror reflection.



            He looks away and finds Nicola's eyes searching for him in

            the mirror.  She knows what he is thinking.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      I wish I knew how much time I have left?



                                NICOLA SIX

                      You've got enough.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Just enough?



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Yes.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Thank you.



            INT. THE GEORGE WASHINGTON PUB DARTS MATCH - NIGHT



            C.U. on Keith's furry loafers curled at the toe, planted on

            the oche.



            PAN UP his cream hipster flares, as his hand runs over his

            fly with its individual loops, each tied in a bow, and

            tasseled with fringe and pom-pom.



            PAN further up his brown moire silk shirt, new haircut and

            blow-dry.  His chest jerks with pain from a broken rib.  All

            of Keith tightens, stretches.



            C.U. on MARTIN PERMANE'S hearing aid, distorting.  Martin, an

            old darts opponent, past seventy.  Keith's voice whistles

            piercingly, shrilly, in his ear.



                                KEITH TALENT

                             (distorted in the hearing

                              aid)

                      M'whole life ahead of me.  Innit.



            Keith recalls Nicola before throwing his next dart.  He looks

            back at her in the audience beside Sam.



            C.U. on Keith's dart landing on - double twenty.  A JUDGE

            announces into a mike, as heard through Martin Permane's

            whistling hearing aid.



                                JUDGE

                             (distorted in the hearing

                              aid)

                      We are pleased to announce here tonight

                      the victor Keith Talent.  Going on to the

                      Semi-Finals.



            INT. NICOLA'S APT - THE NEXT MORNING



            Nicola is dressed in a white satin party frock with flounces,

            and a scarlet satin sash.  She has applied her makeup with

            pale powdered skin and blushing cheeks, lips, like a girl

            going to her first ball.  Guy, in a tweed suit, balances a

            teacup on his lap.  Rain taps against the windows, pelts down

            on the skylight above her.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      My sexual life...just never happened.

                      Perhaps it had to do with my parents

                      dying when they did.  An only child.

                      Fourteen.  And I had seen what happened

                      to Enola.  Though I yearned for a sexual

                      climax, whatever that is.



            His teacup and saucer begins to click, the silver spoon

            falls.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      I wonder what happens to all that - all

                      that sap?



            Guy's POV of Nicola's face mismatched on her fourteen year

            old body.  She smiles at Guy, patting the cushion at her

            side.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      I tell you what.  Let me lead.  I won't

                      be so shy.



            She kisses his face, then his mouth.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      Don't stop.



            He's struggling beneath her.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      Please.  Please no.

EXT. NICOLA'S APT - NEXT



            Guy pauses winded, in the garden path.  The moon is red and

            low.  Wind blows fiercely.  Hail pours down suddenly.



                                VOICE (O.S.)

                      Yo!



            Keith approaches from across the road carrying his tool bag,

            darts pants on from last night.

                      Prestigious.  Eurobank.  Motorway

                      contraflow.  Intercool.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      What?



            Keith puts his arm around Guy's neck.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Is it okay, if I take your place?  I'll

                      just nip in where you just been.  I'll

                      wait for you to go and then slot in after

                      you.  I'll ease in there.  No sweat.

                      (Pause)...  Because they fucking clamp

                      you round here.  Parking fines are steep

                      as such.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      Yes of course, Keith.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      Bollinger.  Veuve Clicquot.  Oh uh.  You

                      coming to the next match?  You forgotten.

                      You missed tonight. Onna darts.



                                GUY CLINCH

                      Sorry.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      I won didn't I?  And she said I would.

                      Nicola did.  Now I've just got to help

                      her with the electricals as such.



            INT. NICOLA'S - LATER



            Nicola sits across from Keith.  He empties his scotch.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      I suppose one of the great things about

                      masturbation is that nobody wants to be

                      seen doing it.  We all have a dirty

                      little secret, don't we, Keith?



                                KEITH TALENT

                      That ain't no secret.  I'm at it all the-



            INT.  NICOLA'S APT. DOORWAY - NEXT



            Later, by the door, she hands him an Yves Saint Laurent shoe

            box full of money.



            Sam opens the bottle and pops a pill into his mouth.  Washes

            it down with vodka.  Realizing how crazy it was to eat a pill

            just like that -



                                SAMSON YOUNG (V.O.)

                      Nicola knows Guy would kill for love.

                      Which would be very useful for her.  In

                      the end, that may be a good way for her

                      to be killed.



            EXT. CLINCH CASTLE IRELAND - DAY



            Looking right out of a storybook looking more fantasy than

            real.  O.S. the phone rings.



            INT. CLINCH CASTLE IRELAND - THAT DAY



            A phone is picked up in a succession of medieval rooms with

            staff in kilts:  STEWARDS in the breakfast room, SECRETARIES

            in the office, LAWYERS in the Library, GAMEKEEPERS on the

            grounds, who finally hand the portable phone to Guy's FATHER,

            Mr. Clinch who is wearing a hint of medieval attire.



            INT. GUY'S HOTEL ROOM BAYSWATER ROAD - DAY



                                GUY CLINCH

                      Father, you wouldn't understand, but I've

                      never felt happier in my life.



            INT. CLINCH CASTLE - DAY



                                FATHER

                             (after a long pause)

                      Well there's nothing much more to say, is

                      there.  You have my... my "okay."  All

                      the best, dear boy.  I'm glad we talked.



                                GUY CLINCH (O.S.)

                      Father.  Father.  Have you any opinion on

                      the crisis as yet?  It is tomorrow you

                      realize.



                                FATHER

                      Ahh, you mean the Cathartic War.  Poor

                      old deterrence is in bad shape, so you

                      give it a little jolt.  Two cities.  It's

                      good isn't it?  We'd all feel so much

                      better after a cathartic war.



            INT. GUY'S HOTEL ROOM BAYSWATER ROAD - SAME



                                GUY CLINCH

                      But Father, I'm in one of those two

                      cities.



            O.S. his Father hangs up the phone.



            INT. PHONE BOOTH NORFOLK - SAME



            Guy on the pay phone to Nicola.  In his hand is the novel

            Nicola gave him to read on the train - "The Light of Many

            Suns."



                                GUY CLINCH

                      I Miss you.  Miss you terribly.  I'll

                      read the book you gave me my love and

                      I'll be thinking of you, on every page,

                      I'll see you.



                                NICOLA SIX (O.S.)

                      Yes darling.  Read it please.  And then

                      come right over to my flat and hold me

                      tight.  Tomorrow's my birthday.



                                                            CUT TO BLACK



            She leaves the car, walks to the garden gate, then returns.

            She kisses Guy through the driver's window.  She gives Guy

            the Jewish Princess.  She does enough, in any case, to rebrim

            his sobbing boner.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      I can't answer any more of your

                      questions.  I can't tell you any more

                      than I already have.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Because the union of two beings is sacred

                      and



            INT. MARK ASPREY'S BEDROOM - SAME AS BEFORE - NIGHT



            There's a drugged unreality to the scene.  Sam is heavily

            medicated.



            Sam's T-shirt is soaked in sweat, his forehead shows tiny

            beads of sweat.  An empty bottle of Kettel One Vodka, a full

            bottle of pain pills, overflowing ashtray, diaries open on

            top of the bed.  He coughs.



            Sam rests his head on a pillow, looks at himself in the

            mirrored ceiling.  O.S. his radiator pipes groan.



            His hand reaches for a diary of Nicola's. Opens it.



            Sam, in T-shirt and pyjama bottoms, sits on his bed, reaches

            for a pill container.  C.U. on the doctor's name - Dr.

            Richard Slizard - instructions printed on label.



            C.U. on the diary-heading:  Nicola Six's Kisses:  category,

            subheads, genres, phyla- In bed, Sam reads up on her kisses.



                                SAMSON YOUNG (V.O.)

                      The Rosebud, the Dry Application,

                      Anybody's, Clash of the Incisors,

                      Lady MacBeth, the Readied Pussy, Youth,

                      the Needer, the Gobbler, the Deliquescent

                      Virgin... My God!  This is frightening.

                             (a long pause)

                      Then there's one that is a blend of two:

                      the Needer and the Deliquescent Virgin.

                      It's called the Wounded Bird.



            Nicola walks into the shot.  She takes the diary from Sam and

            starts to teach by demonstrating on him the following:



                                NICOLA SIX

                      With the Wounded Bird, you must fix

                      things so that your partner, or opponent,

                      feels your desperate reluctance even as

                      your lips hone in on his.  It is

                      particularly handy after fights or when

                      you want to turn a man around within the

                      space of a few seconds.  With this kiss,

                      you stand on tiptoe straining for more,

                      while the mouth, must seem to want to

                      turn and hide.  Physically this is among

                      my mildest.



            She releases Sam from the Wounded Bird Kiss.  Stunned.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      How can I write about a sack artist?  I'm

                      fucked.



            C.U. on the diary- The Jewish Princess Kiss.  Angle on Nicola

            reading from the book.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      The Jewish Princess:  At the other end of

                      the escalation ladder - intense,

                      athletic, hard-core - a kiss I seldom

                      use.  It is vulgar, young, effortlessly

                      multiorgasmic and impossibly avid:  the

                      Jewish Princess is all tongue - and not

                      its tip but its trunk, its meat:  brute

                      tongue.  Such a kiss is a weapon.



            She moves to Sam.  Fear in his eyes. She demonstrates.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      To achieve the Jewish Princess you bring

                      your tongue out to its full extent and

                      let it rest on the lower lip before the

                      kiss begins.  Thus the kiss, when it

                      comes, is from the second mouth.  Applied

                      at the right moment, it makes a man kneel

                      on the floor with his chequebook in his

                      hands.  Applied at the wrong moment it

                      could finish a love affair in half a

                      minute.



            Sam looks amazed.  Speechless. She snaps her diary shut with

            a noticeably jarring sound.  Hands the diary back to Sam.

            Gone.  Nicola walks out of the shot.



                                SAMSON YOUNG (V.O.)

                      We've got some major progress here.  The

                      bra is off.  She gives him her apartment

                      keys and then the Grand-a-Night-Hooker

                      kiss.



                                SAMSON YOUNG (V.O.)

                      At 2:05 the fizzy tights come cracking

                      off.



                                SAMSON YOUNG (V.O.)

                      Her panties, innocently unfeminine in

                      texture were last seen at 3:20.



                                SAMSON YOUNG (V.O.)

                      He had entered on tiptoe; but by 5:40 he

                      was fully and hugely established in the

                      purple-lined palace of sweet sin.



                                SAMSON YOUNG (V.O.)

                      By 6:15 on the morning of the third day,

                      technically before murder day, she's got

                      five toes on either shoulder, Guy's face

                      in her mouth.  Guy's swinging back and

                      forth like an apeman.  And then she pulls

                      this:



                                NICOLA SIX

                      But, you made me ridiculous.  How did you

                      dare?  I thought I was meant to be

                      tragic.  At least a bit.  And all this

                      stuff as if I wasn't in control.  Every

                      second.



                                STEWARDESS

                      If you don't want to say, I-



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      I'm moving from New York City to London.

                      And no amount of political controversy

                      can keep me from reaching my final

                      destination.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      I don't know why I'm not scared of the

                      nuclear bomb aimed at us, here, in

                      London, as we speak.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      If it happens, it'll be so fast you won't

                      even know it.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Ugh, it'll never happen.  Not in a

                      trillion years.  They'll settle.  The

                      president will sign.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      I wouldn't sign if I were him.  What for?



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Too much to lose.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      That's right.



                                MURDEREE

                      You, always you.



                                SAMSON YOUNG (V.O.)

                      Nicola Six knew for a very long time that

                      she would be murdered.



            INT. AIRPLANE PREMONITION 1986 - NIGHT



            A terrified commercial airplane descends nose down.  The

            PASSENGERS hang, held in by seatbelts, or fall from their

            seats.  Nicola's PARENTS seated next to each other experience

            this horror with some calm, holding each other's hand.



            EXT. AIRPLANE PREMONITION 1986 - SAME



            The plane nosedives down to an open farm field.  Explodes in

            flames on impact.  BANG.  Steel crushed on impact with the

            earth.



                                NICOLA SIX

                      You mean about your illness?



                                NICOLA SIX

                      Your life will so soon be over.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      I have that in common with you.



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      I'm confident.  We're all confident.

                      We're the ones who are here with nuclear

                      weapons pointed at us.

                      Ugh, it'll never happen.  Not in a

                      trillion years.  They'll settle.  The

                      president will sign.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      I wouldn't sign if I were him.  What for?



                                SAMSON YOUNG

                      Too much to lose.



                                KEITH TALENT

                      That's right.

                                SAMSON YOUNG (V.O.)

                      And this time it was going to be

                      different.



            INT. MARK ASPREY'S BEDROOM - LATE LATE NIGHT



            Sam flips through some more pages of Nicola's diary.  Angle

            on the pages turning in his dry hands.  He stops on a

            page...looks into her life.



            INT. NICOLA'S NOTTING HILL FLAT FLASHBACK 1999 - LATE NIGHT



            Her fifth floor walk up almost luxuriously appointed.  Nicola

            in underwear.  You see it immediately; she's blossomed into a

            woman.  She pushes a young blonde MAN out of her flat with

            his trousers round his knees, a ripped beige camel hair coat

            thrown over his ripped shirt.



            INT.  NICOLA'S NOTTING HILL FLAT - FLASHBACK RECENTLY - DAY



            Nicola throws a weighty ashtray out the window.



            She leans forward, sees it fly through the air.  Nicola's POV

            as the ashtray sails downward plummeting on the flesh-colored

            Scimitar car tinted windshield.



            Running to the Scimitar, the young blonde Man is fuming mad.



                                MAN

                             (screaming)

                      I'll be back.  And when I do come back

                      you'll be begging for it.



            Upstairs in her flat, Nicola rubs ice on her bruised lip.



            He gets into the car and sits beneath the shattered

            windshield.



                                SAMSON YOUNG (V.O.)

                      The big mystery is, why does she do this

                      when she knows what's going to happen to

                      him?



            She sees the car leave at the highest speed in reverse!  Rams

            into a truck, fatally.  The lorry engine bursts into flames.

            The interior of the flesh-colored Scimitar catches fire

            engulfing the conscious driver screaming as he burns.

            EXT. BUILDING ON TOP OF GRAND CENTRAL STATION NYC - DAWN



            On a mid-floor Dr. Slizard is a small speck, talking out

            loud, alone.



            INT. DR. SLIZARD'S OFFICE - DAWN



            Dr. Slizzard sits behind his desk on the phone.



                                DR. SLIZARD

                      It's like this.  Do you go in now, and

                      take the chance, or let the system

                      degrade further.  The Pentagon is for

                      going in; State would prefer to ride it

                      out; the NSC is torn.  Me, I'm for ride

                      out.



            INT. MARK ASPREY'S OFFICE LIBRARY - SAME



            INT. PAY PHONE MENTAL INSTITUTION TV ROOM - NEXT



            In SLOW MOTION - Guy walks the concourse - everywhere young

            women look at him with kindness.  Guy makes eye contact with

            an OLD MAN anD AN OLD WOMAN, BOY (in angel costume), GIRL (in

            devil costume), a child (in ghost sheet), a perfect family

            formation.  Guy walks to the pay phone in the rear of the

            room. He enters a red enclosed phone booth.  The red framed

            door closes.  O.S. the sound of a phone dialing.



            INT. PHONE BOOTH - SAME



            O.S. a phone rings.  Someone picks up on the other line.



                                NICOLA SIX (O.S.)

                      Guy?  Is it you?  I can tell.  Come to

                      me, my darling.  Come to me.  At the

                      speed of love.



            Guy, too conflicted to speak, hangs up.  The phone returns to

            dial tone.  Guy dials Nicola again.  The phone rings O.S.
