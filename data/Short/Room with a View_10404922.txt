A TITLE CARD SAYS: THE BERTOLINI

EVENING. PENSION ROOM WITH A VIEW THROUGH WINDOW.

The view is across the Arno towards the church of San
Miniato, with the foothills of the Appenines beyond. A
few tiny figures - men, horses and carriages ~ can be
glimpsed and a few lights. It is peaceful and still,
except for the turbulent river itself, swollen with
spring rains and melting snow from the mountains. It
churns and crashes against the bridges and quays, a
wild torrent contained within the stone constraints of
one of history's greatest cities: Florence.

An OLD MAN, inhabitant of the pension room, enters the
frame and stands looking out of the window.

After a few moments, a YOUNG MAN also enters and goes
to stand at the window. As he does so, the OLD MAN
transfers his look and now searches the face of the
YOUNGER MAN briefly. These two are MR. EMERSON and
his son, GEORGE.

A dinner gong sounds. The OLD MAN turns at once and
disappears, leaving the YOUNG MAN by himself. He
continues to look down at the river.

2. EVENING. INTERIOR. PENSION ROOM WITH NO VIEW.

cU LUCY - she is opening a window shutter to look out:
there is an expression of eager anticipation on her
pretty young face.

We watch this expression abruptly change to one of dis-
appointment; she also utters an exclamation of
disappointment at what she sees.

POV LUCY - the window she has opened looks out on nothing
more exciting than a dark dreary courtyard with some
washing slung across it.

The dinner gong is sounding.
She is joined at the window by CHARLOTTE, an English

spinster. In contrast to LUCY's expression of keen
disappointment, CHARLOTTE looks only grimly disapproving.

CHARLOTTE
This is not what we were led
to expect.

LUCY

I thought we were going to see
the Arno!
3.

 

CHARLOTTE
The Signora distinctly wrote:
south rooms with a view, close
together, instead of which she
has given us north rooms, a
long way apart. Come, dear, or
we shall miss our dinner on top
of everything else.

They turn from the window to go out -
CHARLOTTE

She had no business to do it,
no business at all.

EVENING. PENSION CORRIDOR AND STAIRS.

4.

These too are disappointing - they might as well be in
any over-furnished, under-ventilated, somewhat down-at-
heel Victorian English boarding house.

CHARLOTTE is sniffing the air. She proceeds with
caution, leading the way, as if someone might jump out
of a dark corner and carry LUCY off.

A buxom, smiling, Italian peasant GIRL passes them on
the stairs with her chambermaid paraphernalia. She
says, “Buona Sera."

LUCY returns her greeting and looks after her with
pleasure - but CHARLOTTE continues her dignified descent.

CHARLOTTE
Any nook does for me, but it does
seem hard that you shouldn't have
a view.

LUCY
(with a touch of irritation) No,
of course, you must have a view,
too.

They have reached the dining room and enter it.
DAY. INTERIOR. PENSION DINING ROOM.

As in any stuffy English boarding house, it has heavy
furniture, portraits of Queen Victoria and Lord Tennyson,
an apidistra, and plush curtains heavy and sombre with
dust and the smell of gravy. The guests seated at the
long table include MISS LAVISH, the MISS ALANS, MR.
EMERSON, GEORGE EMERSON, and four or five other GUESTS,
equally unmistakably English tourists taking their
evening meal. The women outnumber the men three to one.
 

3

The table is laid with an almost white tablecloth, huge
silverplate cruets, and bottles of water alternating with
bottles of red wine.

The GUESTS are sawing away at their tough pieces of meat
with determination but also with true English boarding
house refinement. Their acknowledgment of LUCY and
CHARLOTTE is equally genteel: their eyes remain frozen,
and the inclination of the head by way of welcome is
barely perceptible.

LUCY and CHARLOTTE accept this cold and silent formality
as the correct behaviour toward two strangers who have
not yet proved themselves. Silently and humbly, they
slip into the two empty chairs.

These are opposite MR. EMERSON and GEORGE - who are
markedly different from the other guests. Their recep-
tion of the newcomers is also different:

MR. EMERSON, an elderly, plump gentleman with childlike
eyes, has his mouth full and so can only wave his fork
cheerily in their direction.

They pretend not to see this.

GEORGE doesn't look up from his plate at all but frowns
down at it in terrible concentration. He is not eating
his food but arranging it on his plate as if it were some
mathematical problem he was struggling to solve.

The awful silence which has greeted the new arrivals is
broken by MISS LAVISH - a middle-aged bohemian biue-
stocking - continuing to expound the theme they have
interrupted:

MISS LAVISH
It is only by going off the track
that you get to know the country.
See the little towns - Gubbio,
Pienza, Cortono, San Gimignano,
Montriano ... (these names are
pronounced with an elaborate
Anglo-Italian flourish)

MR. EMERSON is trying to attract the attention of a LADY
further down the table who is filling her glass from a
little bottle of her own.

MR. EMERSON
Miss Pole! I say there - Miss
Pole!
LADY
(looking at him with displeasure)
Yes, Mr. Emerson?

MR, EMERSON
I say, what's that you're taking?
It's not lemonade, is it?

LADY
It is lemonade, Mr. Emerson.

MR. EMERSON
(unaware of her disdain, moved
only by genuine concern for her)
Put it away, Miss Pole: right
away! Lemonade is nothing but
acidity - very bad for the stomach.

A gasp from MISS CATHERINE ALAN, an elderly spinster -
followed by a giggle that has to be stifled in her napkin.

She is rebuked in a whisper by her sister, TERESA, an
even more elderly spinster.

MISS CATHERINE
But he said - he said - the word
S., Teresa.

MISS TERESA
It's nothing to laugh at,
Catherine. On the contrary.

MISS LAVISH
(continuing after the regrettable
interruption) We must get away
from that awful tourist idea that
Italy is only a museum of
antiquities and art.

LADY
Have you seen Monteriano? When
you visit the market there you
are far from the idea of a museum
-..unless you want to call those
quaint stalls a living museum!

ANOTHER LADY
A museum of types...

LUCY and CHARLOTTE, knowing they have not yet passed the
requisite test to enter into the general conversation, —
confine themselves to talking to each other in low voices:
5.

CHARLOTTE
I shall tell the Signora that
the first South room view avail-
able shall be given to you, Lucy.

LUCY
Why not to you, Charlotte?

CHARLOTTE
I insist on it...This meat has
surely been boiled for soup.

MISS LAVISH
«+-Monteriano is not only quaint,
but there one meets the Italians
unspoiled: in all their simplicity
and charm!

NIGHT. PENSION SCULLERY.

We get a glimpse of the urispoiled ITALIANS in all their
simplicity and charm. The plates come back from the
dining room with their unchewable bits of meat and other
refuse. Some of this is flung straight to the dogs
underfoot who grab it, while the dirty plates are tossed
into a sink full of grey, greasy water. There is much
banging and loud laughter, the COOK swigs his wine and
pinches one of the SERVING GIRLS, a LITTLE BOY cries as
he ladles prunes into glass dishes, which are taken

away to the guests.

NIGHT. PENSION DINING ROOM.

Unspoilt Monteriano is still the topic of conversation,
as LUCY and CHARLOTTE continue to discuss the Signora's
perfidy.

MISS CATHERINE
Isn't Monteriano where we saw the
violets, Teresa? An entire carpet
of them: it was delightful. I
find the violet the most delightful
of flowers, don't you, Miss Lavish?

MISS LAVISH
I prefer something wilder, bolder
- the reckless rose, the tempestuous
tulip...

CHARLOTTE
Your mother would never forgive me
if I took the view.
 

LUCY
Mother would want you to have it.

CHARLOTTE
On no account: the view from
the Arno is yours.

The two, tired and out of sorts, are working each other
up. By now, they both sound distinctly peevish.

LUCY
I don't know why we are arguing
because we don't have it. We
have no view.

MR, EMERSON
(leaning across the table toward
them) I have a view. I have a
view.

CHARLOTTE is startled. Her glance passes over EMERSON
quickly but she doesn't really look at him. His forward-
ness strikes her as uncouth and ill-bred.

MR. EMERSON
So does George - my son George
here.

LUCY, who is about to speak, is repressed by CHARLOTTE.
GEORGE continues to frown at the diagram he has arranged
on his plate.

MR. EMERSON
We both have rooms with views.

CHARLOTTE
(looking over his head, muttering
vaguely) Delightful - a view -
how very delightful.

MR, EMERSON
What I mean is that you can have
our rooms, and we'll have yours.
We'll change.

The other GUESTS fall silent. Some appear shocked; all
sympathize with the newcomers as MR. EMERSON expands on
his offer.

MR. EMERSON
Why shouldn't you have them?
Why shouldn't they have them,
George? Hm? They want rooms
with views, so they can have
ours. It's very simple.
 

7

Lucy gives a start of pleasure and gratitude - CHARLOTTE
restrains her.

CHARLOTTE
Thank you. You are most kind.
It is entirely out of the question.

A murmur of approval from the rest of the table: evidently
these newcomers, as against the EMERSONS, have the right
attitude and breeding.

MR. EMERSON
(getting red and excited) It's
the simplest thing on earth:
isn't it, George? George! They
want views, we don't want them.
Ergo, they should have them.

The whole table is attentive: they are impressed by
CHARLOTTE's brilliantly correct handling of this
impossible situation and this impossible old man.

CHARLOTTE
Thank you very much indeed. We
could not impose on your kindness.

MR, EMERSON
(both fists planted on the table
in challenge) Why? There's no
kindness. Only common sense.

LUCY
You see, we wouldn't like to -

CHARLOTTE
Eat your dinner, dear.

MR. EMERSON
(thumping his fists like a naughty
child) Women like looking at a
view; men don't. George, persuade
them.

GEORGE
(without looking up) It's obvious
they should have the rooms. There's
nothing else to say.

LUCY regards him with covert curiosity. He looks
brooding, perplexed - but also very handsome in a
rugged, manly way.
 

MR. EMERSON
(attacking CHARLOTTE almost
violently) Why shouldn't you
change? We can clear out in
half an hour! 15 minutes!
It's ridiculous - these niceties:
they contravene common sense;
every kind of sense.

CHARLOTTE places her knife and fork together neatly on
her empty plate. She has the air of a martyr - but one
firm and strong in resolve.

MR. EMERSON is now talking to the table at large, waving
his arms about -

MR. EMERSON
I don't care for what I see
outside.

CHARLOTTE looks around her as much as to say, "Are you
all like this?" And the two MISSES ALAN, who are sitting
further up the table, with shawls hanging over the backs
of their chairs, look back, clearly indicating, "We are
not; we are genteel."

CHARLOTTE
(regarding the pudding plate
placed in front of her) No,
thank you.

She is pressing LUCY's foot under the table.

MR. EMERSON
(thumping his heart) Here is
where the birds sing; here is
where the sky is blue.

CHARLOTTE
(whispering) Let's go, Lucy.

She gets up with resolution.

Her exit is very different from her entrance. She is
acknowledged by the OTHERS with murmurs of warmth and
friendliness: CHARLOTTE has proved herself.

LUCY has to follow her. But as she goes, she turns once
and makes a hasty bow ~- a shamefaced acknowledgment - to
the EMERSONS.

Only GEORGE sees it: and he replies by raising his
eyebrows and smiling in a strange, quizzical way.
7.

LUCY, confused, blushing, not knowing what to make of
this smile, hurries after CHARLOTTE.

NIGHT. INTERIOR, PASSAGE BETWEEN DINING AND

DRAWING ROOMS.

Once outside here, the stately and victorious CHARLOTTE
collapses.

CHARLOTTE
What an impossible person!

LUCY
He meant to be kind - I don't
understand you -

CHARLOTTE
Please leave it to me: I know
how to deal with such people.

LUCY
Charlotte, you dealed rudely!
You dealed wrongly!

CHARLOTTE does not acknowledge that she has dealt wrongly
and says grimly:

CHARLOTTE
This pension is a failure. Tomorrow
we'll make a change.

Her tone of "nanny-knows-best" goads LUCY to further anger
and in this heated state they enter the drawing room.

NIGHT. INTERIOR. PENSION DRAWING ROOM,

This room, with its tightly stuffed, round, tomato-red
chairs and armchairs, does its best to reproduce the
solid comfort of a Bloomsbury boarding house.

MR. BEEBEE, an English clergyman with a bald head and red
whiskers, is seated there with an English newspaper which
he lowers at the tempestuous entrance of the TWO LADIES.

At the sight of him, their anger with each other turns
into a sort of hysterical relief.

They exclaim, they rush up to him, they appear to be
surrounding him -

LUCY
Why, it's Mr. Beebee! Oh, how
perfectly lovely! Oh, Charlotte,
we must stop now, however bad
the rooms are.
 

10

CHARLOTTE
(with more restraint) How do you
do, Mr. Beebee?

He has risen in amazement. The TWO WOMEN start explaining
simultaneously.

LUCY
Don't you remember us -

CHARLOTTE
Miss Bartlett and Miss Honeychurch.
We met at Tunbridge Wells when you
came to help our vicar -

LUCY
- That very cold Easter!

LUCY is in a state of what might be called spiritual
starvation. As Forster says, she would have been glad
to see the waiter if CHARLOTTE had permitted it. She
rushes on:

LUCY
Just fancy how small the world
is! I've heard from Mother that
you are to be our vicar -

CHARLOTTE
Miss Honeychurch will be one of
your parishioners -

LUCY
At Summer Street -

Slowly MR. BEEBEE gets all this straightened out. He
welcomes them pleasantly.

MR. BEEBEE
Quite right - I move into the
rectory at Summer Street in
June.

LucY
Our house is called Windy Corner
- oh, I am so glad to see you.

CHARLOTTE, exhausted by strong emotion, sinks into one
of the tomato chairs.

The two MISS ALANS enter and go up to CHARLOTTE:
MISS CATHERINE

We did feel so sorry for you
in the dining room.
11

MISS TERESA
Mr. Emerson is so tactless.

LUCY
But he meant to be kind. (to
MR. BEEBEE) This old gentleman
- and his son - kindly offered
us their rooms with a view. For
ours which have no view.

MR, BEEBEE
(judiciously weighing the situation)
I see.

TERESA

It was most indelicate.

CATHERINE
But things that are indelicate -
can sometimes be beautiful.

LUCY
Oh yes! Yes!

CHARLOTTE
I am the chaperone of my young
cousin, Lucy, and it would be a
serious thing if I put her under
an obligation to people of whom
we know nothing.

MR. BEEBEE is thoughtful for a few moments.

MR. BEEBEE
I don't think much harm would
have come of accepting...

LUCY
There, Charlotte. (or she only
looks this meaning)

CHARLOTTE
(pursing her mouth, to MR. BEEBEE)
So you think I ought to have
accepted their offer? You think
I have been narrow-minded?

MR. BEEBEE
(who is used to pursed-mouth
females) Not at all. I never
suggested that.

He catches LUCY's imploring look -
9.

10.

12

MR. BEEBEE
«eeIf you will allow me, I would
be happy to be your intermediary
with Mr. Emerson.

Everyone looks at CHARLOTTE, who remains silent and tight-
lipped.

MR. BEEBEE
(gently) I think he would not
take advantage of your acceptance,
nor expect any gratitude. He has
rooms he does not value, and he
thinks you would value them.

LUCY
Charlotte, please.

CHARLOTTE
My own wishes, dearest Lucy, are
unimportant in comparison with
yours. I am only here through
your kindness. If you want me
to turn these gentlemen out of
their rooms, I will do it. Would
you then, Mr. Beebee, kindly tell
Mr. Emerson we accept his offer?

MR. BEEBEE bows and departs with the message, looking
irritated.

LUCY
He is nice. Just what I remember.
He seems to see good in everyone.
No one would take him for a

clergyman.
NIGHT. INTERIOR. ROOM WITH VIEW.

GEORGE is throwing his things together, moving out of the
room.

NIGHT. INTERIOR. ROOM WITHOUT VIEW.

PORTER is shouldering baggage, under CHARLOTTE's
supervision.

CHARLOTTE
(to LUCY, as they follow PORTER)
Remember, Lucy, I alone am implicated
in this.

They go out into the passage.
11.

12.

13
NIGHT. INTERIOR. UPSTAIRS PASSAGE.

GEORGE, with his baggage, is coming from one side, PORTER
with baggage and CHARLOTTE and LUCY following, from the
other.

A collision is imminent.

CHARLOTTE
I do not wish the acceptance to
come from you. (hissing, so
that GEORGE, who is now upon
them, might not hear) Grant me
that, at all events.

There is now an impasse in the corridor and CHARLOTTE
talks her way around it:

CHARLOTTE
{to GEORGE) I would like to
thank your father personally for
his kindness to us.

GEORGE
(skillfully maneuvering his way)
You can't. He's in his bath.

CHARLOTTE gasps -

But GEORGE does not notice. He has managed to get past
them and is on his way to his new room.

LUCY, following CHARLOTTE and PORTER, is trying hard to
look serious.

NIGHT. INTERIOR. ROOM WITH VIEW (CHARLOTTE'S).

LUCY is by the window breathing in the night air, while
CHARLOTTE is arranging her things.

CHARLOTTE
.«..Naturally, of course, I would
have given the larger room to you;
but I happen to know that it was
the young man's -

As LUCY does not follow this reasoning -

CHARLOTTE
In my small way, I am a woman of
the world, and I know where things
lead to...
 

14

Arranging her toilet accessories on the washstand, she
is stopped short by the sight of a sheet of paper pinned
up over it. It is scrawled with an enormous note of
interrogation.

CHARLOTTE
What ever does it mean?

LUCY comes and looks at it with her. There is an
imperious knock on the door. At LUCY's “Come in!"
GEORGE enters. He strides to the washstand. He tears
down the sheet of paper. Murmuring an awkward apology,
he leaves with it. The TWO WOMEN stare after him.

MORNING. LUCY'S PENSION BEDROOM.

13.

LUCY is awake in her bed, looking about her pleasant
room, which Forster describes thus: "...a bright bare
room, with a floor of red tiles which look clean though
they are not; with a painted ceiling whereon pink
griffins and blue amorini-sport in a forest of yellow
violins and bassoons..." LUCY takes this in (an
equivalent room will have to be found, or decorated)
and then jumps out of bed.

She goes to the window and with some difficulty gets the
shutters open, squeezing her fingers in the process.
When they open, the room fills with sunlight and LUCY
looks at her VIEW. She sees below as much of the
following as can be managed:

",..Over the river men were at work with
spades and sieves on the sandy foreshore,

and on the river was a boat...An electric

tram came rushing underneath the window...

its platforms were overflowing with Italians...
Children tried to hang on behind...Then
soldiers appeared - goodlooking, undersized
men - wearing each a knapsack covered with
mangy fur, and a greatcoat which had been

cut for some larger soldier. Beside them
walked officers, looking foolish and fierce,
and before them went little boys, turning
somersaults in time with the band. The tram-
car became entangled in their ranks, and moved
on painfully, like a caterpillar in a swarm

of ants. One of the little boys fell down,
and some white bullocks came out of an
archway..."

LUCY's enjoyment of this Saul Steinberg scene is cut short
by a tap on the door. It is CHARLOTTE, who comes in and
admonishes her on leaving her door unlocked, and on her
14.

15

leaning out of the window in her nightgown, CHARLOTTE
tells her that if they don't hurry up, the better part
of the day will be lost.

DAY. PENSION DINING ROOM.

15.

Most people have finished their breakfasts, except for
MISS LAVISH, who sits over her coffee with LUCY and
CHARLOTTE, who are arguing. CHARLOTTE wants to go out,
but LUCY makes excuses in order to shake her off: she's
feeling a wee bit tired, she'd like to settle in, she
thinks she'll play the piano, etc. CHARLOTTE offers to
stay in with her; LUCY says that would never do; Yes
yes, No no, etc. When she's ready, she'll go out alone.
CHARLOTTE can't allow this, she must accompany LUCY
everywhere. More Yes yes, No no, certainly not!

MISS LAVISH
Being English, Miss Honeychurch
will be perfectly safe. Italians
understand. A dear friend ~f£ mine,
Contessa Baroncelli, has two
daughters, and when she cannot
send a maid to school with them
she lets them go in sailor-hats
instead. Everyone takes them for
English, you see, especially if
their hair is strained tightly
behind.

DAY. EXTERIOR. FLORENCE BACK STREETS.

MISS LAVISH, very bohemian in a blue military cloak
swinging behind her, is conducting CHARLOTTE through

the back streets of Florence. These streets are intricate
and dirty, and as they penetrate deeper into them, MISS
LAVISH expresses herself more and more enchanted.

MISS LAVISH
A smell, a true Florentine smell!
Inhale, my dear: deeper. Every
city, let me tell you, has its
own smell.

In another dirty alley:

MISS LAVISH
How I love these little back
alleys. Look at that adorable
wine-cart! How the driver
stares at us, dear, simple soul!

CHARLOTTE is evidently less entranced. From time to time
she is forced to bring her handkerchief to her nose and
 

16

tread rather delicately around something indelicate on
the road. As they make their way, and pause from time
to time for MISS LAVISH to drink in local sensations, we
hear the following snatches of conversation:

MISS LAVISH
«-.One has always to be open:
wide open. I think Miss Lucy is.

CHARLOTTE
(nervously) Lucy - open? To
what, Miss Lavish?

MISS LAVISH
To physical sensation...

CHARLOTTE
Oh! (a very ambiguous exclamation
- laden with both shock and
excitement)

MISS LAVISH
I will let you into a secret,
Miss Bartlett: I have my eye
on your cousin, Miss Lucy
Honeychurch.

CHARLOTTE
(thrilled yet apprehensive)
«..For a character in your novel,
Miss Lavish?

MISS LAVISH
The Young English Girl transfigured
by Italy. And why should she not
be transfigured? It happened to
the Goths...

In another part of the city:

MISS LAVISH

I do declare, we're lost - no,
Miss Bartlett, I will not have
you look into your Baedeker.
Two lone females in an unknown
town...now that's what I call
an adventure. We will simply
drift...

They press on - CHARLOTTE somewhat drooping but MISS
LAVISH undaunted.

Then, as their destination rises up before them suddenly -
16.

 

17

MISS LAVISH
Santa Maria del Fiore! Buon
giorno! Buon giorno! Thou Holy
Maiden of the Dark Ages, I salute
thee!

Two BRITISH TOURISTS can be seen approaching the
Cathedral -

MISS LAVISH
Stop a minute. Let those two
people go on, or I shall have
to speak to them...Oh, the
Britisher abroad!...It's very
naughty of me, but I would set
an examination paper at Dover
and turn back every tourist who
couldn't pass it.

Faced with the Cathedral, CHARLOTTE surreptitiously
tries to look into her Baedeker again -

But MISS LAVISH shuts it and takes it away from her
with a skittish firmness to which CHARLOTTE delightedly
submits.

Arm in arm, with an air aimost of recklessness, MISS
LAVISH's cloak swinging, they scale the steps of the
Cathedral: two British Ladies abroad...

DAY. INTERIOR. PENSION PASSAGE AND STAIRS.

17.

Two more British Ladies abroad: exhausted from a
morning's sightseeing, the MISS ALANS have retreated
back to the pension and are wearily ascending the
stairs.

Sounds of piano music from the drawing room: Beethoven's
Sonata in C minor, Opus 111, played very well.

The MISS ALANS open the door of their room -

DAY. INTERIOR. PENSION ROOM,

They see the room brimming with violets - And MR. EMERSON
filling more vases - And GEORGE wreathing the washstand -
The MISS ALANS advance bewildered -

MR. EMERSON
Well - you said you like violets.

GEORGE
So we brought you violets.
is.

18

MR. EMERSON is so delighted with what he has done - and
indeed the violets are so beautiful - that the MISS
ALANS cannot help being delighted too. They giggle like
two schoolgirls, and encouraged by MR. EMERSON, they even
fix some flowers into their hair -

Sound of piano -

DAY. INTERIOR. PENSION DRAWING ROOM.

LucY is at the little draped piano playing Beethoven.

She plays with verve and authority, and seems intoxicated
by the music and her own playing of it.

MR. BEEBEE is listening to her with growing astonishment.
When she has finished and he has applauded -

MR. BEEBEE
May I say something - rather
daring?

LUCY

Oh, Mr. Beebee: you sound like
Miss Lavish. Don't say you are
writing a novel, too.

MR. BEEBEE
If I were, you should be my heroine
and I would write: “If Miss
Honeychurch ever takes to live as
she plays, it will be very exciting
- both for us and for her."

LUCY doesn't know what he means. As she moves over to
the window -

LUCY
Mother doesn't like me playing
Beethoven. She says I'm always
peevish afterward.

And she does look - if not peevish, then at least
restless, looking out of the window.

MR. BEEBEE
Naturally. One would be stirred
up. That's what music is for.
Won't you play some more?

LUCY .
«ee think I'11l go out. (turning
from the window)
19.

20.

 

19

MR. BEEBEE
What - alone? Would that be
wise, Miss Honeychurch?

LUCY
Oh, Mr. Beebee, to be wise one
might have stayed at home in
Summer Street -

Already half out of the door -

LUCY
I won't go far, I promise.

She has gone before he can say anything.
DAY. INTERIOR. PENSION PASSAGE.

LUCY has walked out so impetuously that she doesn't see,
and nearly collides with, MISS CATHERINE ALAN.

Her apologies are as excited as her movement of exit -
But she doesn't stop.

MISS CATHERINE, astonished, looks after her - then
enters the drawing room.

DAY. INTERIOR. PENSION DRAWING ROOM.

She sidles in characteristically, made self-conscious
by the proximity of a lone man.

MISS CATHERINE
Whatever is the matter with dear
Miss Lucy?

MR. BEEBEE
(watching LUCY from the window)
«eel put it down to too much
Beethoven,

MISS CATHERINE joins him by the window.

MR. BEEBEE
(glancing down at her) You have
flowers in your hair, Miss
Catherine, like a pagan goddess.

She picks them out, smiling as she does so. They both
watch LUCY.

(If it is not possible because of the location to have
them looking out of a window, then let them watch her

through the drawing room door as she makes her escape

via an entrance hall or courtyard.)
21.

TITLE CARD: IN SANTA CROCE WITH NO BAEDEKER
DAY. EXTERIOR. STREETS OF FLORENCE.

Contrary to what MISS LAVISH told her about English girls
in Italy, she is very much noticed and appreciated. MEN
look at her with admiration, one or two try to speak to
her. She either doesn't notice or pretends not to, and
if she acts primly, she's too pretty and youthful for
that to be a drawback; in fact it seems almost a virtue.

She might linger over the Andrea della Robbia Infants of
the Foundling Hospital in the Piazza dell' Annunziata.

DAY. INTERIOR. SANTA CROCE.

LUCY wanders around in the barnlike interior, shivering
with cold. She has no Baedeker, so does not know which
paintings and monuments to admire. She walks about,
somewhat disdainfully, unwilling to be enthusiastic over
monuments of uncertain authorship or date. But then she
gets interested in the place and the scene: PRIESTS,
BEGGARS, GUIDES, TOURISTS.

She tries to puzzle out the Italian notices - one that
forbids people to introduce dogs into the church; another
not to spit on the floor; to cover the head or to uncover
it; not to talk loudly; to remember that the place is a
House of Worship, etc.

She watches other TOURISTS - the diligent foreigners,
consulting their guidebooks, looking from page to statue
and back again, almost like spectators at a tennis match.

She watches the ITALIANS at worship, and particularly
some SMALL CHILDREN who seem to have got worship mixed
up with playing backwards and forwards over the recumbent
forms of some stone bishops.

One CHILD falls.
LUCY starts forward to pick him up. MR. EMERSON appears,
bent on the same mission. Between them they try - in
vain - to comfort the howling CHILD.
MR. EMERSON

Hateful bishop! Hard in life,

hard in death.
The CHILD screams frantically.

An Italian WOMAN takes charge and the CHILD is soon
running around again happily.
She walks

She looks

MR. EMERSON
(to WOMAN) You are a clever
woman. You've done more than
all the relics in the world.

WOMAN
Niente.
away.
LUCY
I'm not sure she understands
English.
MR. EMERSON

She understands everything...Are
you doing the church? Why don't
you join us?

around: is he alone - or is the son with him?

She sees CZORGE: he is intently looking up at the
vaulted roof and doesn't see her.

Lucy
(stiffly, and taking refuge in
her dignity) Thank you very much,
but I could not think of that. I
really came to help with the child,
and to thank you for so kindly
giving us your rooms last night.
I hope that you have not been put
to any great inconvenience.

MR, EMERSON
(gently) My dear, I think that you
are repeating what you have heard
older people say. You are pretending
to be touchy; but you are not really.
Stop being so tiresome, and tell me
instead what part of the church you
want to see. To take you to it will
be a real pleasure.

It is impossible for LUCY to take offense at this old
man's “impertinence" and she stands hesitating. He has
a nosegay of violets tucked into his lapel.

LUCY
I am not touchy, I hope. I want
to see the Giottos - if only I
knew which they were.

MR. EMERSON
Come with me.
 

22

LUCY follows MR. EMERSON into the Peruzzi Chapel. There
is a party of TOURISTS in the chapel, led by MR. EAGER,
a clergyman.

MR. EMERSON greets him cordially - then explains to LUCY
that it is Mr. Eager, the resident English chaplain in
Florence.

MR. EAGER
(lecturing to the TOURISTS)
Observe how Giotto in these
frescoes - now unhappily ruined
by restoration - is untroubled
by the snares of anatomy and
perspective.

MR. EMERSON
(pointing to the fresco of the
Ascension of St. John) Yes, look
at that fat man in blue! He must
weigh as much as I do, and he is
shooting into the sky like an air
balloon.

MR. EAGER resolutely ignores him and goes on instructing
his flock of TOURISTS, who shift uneasily, as does LUCY.

MR. EAGER
Remember the facts about this
church of Santa Croce; how it was
built by faith in the full fervor
of mediaevalism -

MR, EMERSON
Built by faith indeed! That
simply means the workmen weren't
paid properly.

MR. EAGER
(frigidly) Pardon me. The chapel
is somewhat small for two parties.
We will incommode you no longer.

He leads his flock away.
MR. EMERSON
Stop! There's plenty of room
for us all. Stop!

The TOURISTS disappear without a word. MR. EMERSON looks
after them - but forgets about them as his eyes fall on -

GEORGE, standing alone in gloomy abstraction. At this
moment he is not an unattractive figure by any means,
 

23

and in the shadows his face appears tender. LUCY watches
him with feelings of interest for a few seconds and in
turn is observed by MR. EMERSON.

MR, EMERSON
Look at my poor boy...

LUCY looks away; and blushes; and doesn't want to listen
to what MR. EMERSON is saying; and yet does.

MR, EMERSON
He's very unhappy.

LUCY
But why should he be?

MR. EMERSON
Well may you ask...What more is
one to give him? And think how
he has been brought up - free
from all the superstition that
leads men to hate one another in
the name of God...

At this blasphemy, LUCY tries to leave -

Lucy
(murmuring) I must go - my
cousin will be anxious -

MR. EMERSON actually catches hold of her to prevent her.

MR. EMERSON
I don't require you to fall in
love with my boy, but try and
understand him. My poor young
lady, I think you're muddled,
too - you've let other people
muddle you.

LUCY is impressed by the possible truth of this; and she
now looks toward GEORGE with greater sympathy:

LUCY
Is that what's happened to him?
Has he let other people -

MR. EMERSON
No, in his case he's done it himself
- with all this brooding on the
things of the Universe. I don't
believe in this world sorrow. Do
you?
 

23.

24.

24

LUCY
(unable to express herself, yet
with conviction) No. Ohno. I
don't, Mr. Emerson. Not at all.

MR. EMERSON
Well there you are! Then make
my boy realise that by the side
of the everlasting Why there is
ayes! And a Yes and a Yes!

This inflated oratory brings LUCY back to earth. She
adopts a tone of solid, suburban common sense:

LUCY

Has your son no particular hobby?
I generally forget my worries at

the piano; and collecting stamps

did no end of good to Freddy, my

brother...You must excuse me, Mr.
Emerson: my cousin will be most

anxious if I don't get back this

instant...

MR. EMERSON's face saddens. He touches her gently with
his hand.

MR. EMERSON
Poor girl. Poor girl.

LUCY
(flaring up) Poor girl? On the
contrary - I think myself a very
fortunate girl. I'm thoroughly
happy, and having a splendid time.
(in a tone of dismissal) Goodbye.
Thank you both so much for all
your kindness.

She hurries away, not looking right or left, and certainly
not at GEORGE.

DAY. EXTERIOR, OUTSIDE SANTA CROCE.

LUCY is hurrying away from the church - She enters a shop.
DAY. INTERIOR. POSTCARD SHOP.

LUCY buys postcards. These are: Giorgione's Tempesta,
Fra Angelico's Coronation, Giotto's Ascension of St. John,
some Della Robbia babies, some Guido Reni lonnas. She

considers Botticelli's Birth of Venus for a long time,
includes it, then at the last moment decides against it
 

25.

25

and puts it back in the rack. She gets her change
muddled - almost forgets her packet - then goes out.

DUSK. EXTERIOR. IN THE PIAZZA SIGNORIA.

Now she is no longer in a hurry but lingers as if she
were waiting for someone or something to happen to her...
She fixes her eyes on the tower of the Palazzo Vecchio.
It arises out of the surrounding dusk like a pillar of
gold throbbing in the tranquil sky. Absorbed in this
vision, she doesn't notice what is going on around her.

Two MEN very near her have started bickering by the
Loggia. She only vaguely hears their cries of "Cinque
lire! Cinque lire!" They spar at each other -

One MAN is hit lightly on the chest. He frowns; he bends
toward LUCY as if he had an important message for her.

He opens his lips to deliver it, and a stream of blood
comes out and trickles down his unshaven chin.

A CROWD rises up around them. LUCY sees GEORGE looking
at her from out of this CROWD. There are shouts and
cries. The wounded MAN is lifted up and carried to the
fountain. The MURDERER cries out and kisses him. But
LUCY, looking at GEORGE, sees him grow dim...GEORGE,
pushing his way through the CROWD, catches LUCY as she
falls. He carries her in his arms to the steps of the
Uffizi Arcade. He lowers her gently; he supports her in
his arms; he looks into her face.

The hubbub around the fountain comes to them as if from a
great distance. They seem to have moved into a world of
greater silence; sitting there they appear, like the
other statues in the arcade, to be more than human - a
statue not merely of two lovers but of Eternal Lovers.

LUCY opens her eyes. She looks back into his face. She
sits up. He rises and dusts his knees.

LUCY
Oh, what have I done?

GEORGE
You fainted.

LUCY
I - I am very sorry.

GEORGE
How are you now?

LUCY
Perfectly well - absolutely well.
 

26

GEORGE
Then let's come home. There's
no point in our stopping.

He holds out his hand to help her up. She pretends not to
see it.

The cries from the fountain continue, as a background to
this conversation.

LUCY
How very kind you have been! I
might have hurt myself falling.
But now I am well. I can go
alone, thank you.

He remains silent, and his hand remains extended.

LUCY
Oh, my photographs!

GEORGE
What photographs?

LUCY
I bought some photographs at
Alinari's. I must have dropped
them out there in the square.
Would you be so very kind -
thank you so very much -

He nods brusquely, then turns to go. As soon as his back
is turned, LUCY gets up "...with the cunning of a
maniac..." and steals down the arcade toward the Arno.

GEORGE
Miss Honeychurch!

She stops, her hand on her heart.
GEORGE
Sit still; you aren't fit to
go home alone.

LUCY
Yes I am, thank you so very much.

GEORGE
No you aren't.

LUCY
But I had rather -
26.

27

GEORGE
Then I don't fetch your photo-
graphs.

A pause. He tells her commandingly:

GEORGE
Sit down. The man is dead.

Bewildered, she obeys him.

GEORGE
And don't move till I come back.

LUCY sits on the steps:

She sees the black-hooded FIGURES of the Fraternity of
the Misericordia passing like figures in a dream. The
hubbub around the fountain also seems heard as if ina
dream.

LUCY doesn't know what is happening or what has happened.
She buries her face in her hands.

GEORGE finds the packet of photographs lying on the pave-
ment. The envelope is covered with blood. He hesitates,
looks in LUCY's direction, then wipes the blood off with
his handkerchief and goes back to her with the cards.

When GEORGE returns, LUCY pulls herself together. She
becomes brisk, English, suburban again. She rises
without assistance and walks without assistance toward
the Arno.

DUSK. EXTERIOR, EMBANKMENT.

LUCY is babbling on rather breathlessly while GEORGE
strides beside her in his usual impenetrable silence.

LUCY
.-.Iitalians are so very odd,
aren't they. So excitable. Only
yesterday I heard about another
murder - I don't know the details
but a poor little boy was involved.
And yet they seem so kind and
lovable. It's too extraordinary
that they should at the same time
be so violent - Mr. Emerson?

He turns toward her, frowning as if she has disturbed
him in some abstract quest.
 

28

LUCY
I want to ask you something
before we go in.

She stops and leans her elbows on the parapet of the
embankment by the Ponte alle Grazie. He does the same.
In their identity of position, they again suggest
something abstract, more than human - an embodiment

of Eternal Companionship.

LUCY
(moving her elbows) I was never
so much ashamed of myself in my
life; I cannot think what came
over me.

GEORGE
Perfectly natural; I nearly
fainted myself.

LUCY
Well, I owe you a thousand
apologies.

GEORGE accepts them in silence.

Lucy
«.-And - this is what I wanted
to ask you - you know how silly
people are gossiping - (witha
nervous laugh) ladies especially,
I am afraid - you understand
what I mean?

GEORGE
I'm afraid I don't.

LUCY
(with a sigh that such indelicate
explanation should be necessary)
I mean, would you not mention it
to anyone - my foolish behaviour?

He throws something into the river with an abrupt
movement.

LUCY
What was that?...What did you
throw in?

GEORGE

(crossly) Things I didn't want.
29

LUCY
Mr. Emerson!.,..Where are the
photographs?...I believe it was
my photographs you threw away!

GEORGE
(suddenly bewildered, turning
toward her like an anxious boy)
I didn't know what to do with
them!...They were covered with
blood. There; now I've told you.

They both stand again as before, side by side with their
elbows on the parapet. They look down into the river
which has swirled away her bloodied photographs. After
a long silence -

GEORGE
(speaking slowly out of deep
thought) Something tremendous
has happened. It isn't exactly
that a man has died - but some-
thing else too...

LUCY looks into his face as he tries to express himself.
Who knows in what direction his thoughts will go next.
She attempts to stop him before he can say more.

LUCY
Well, thank you again. How
quickly these accidents do
happen, and then one returns
to the old life!

GEORGE
I don't.

She looks at him anxiously.

GEORGE :
Something has happened to me.
I don't know. And perhaps to
you,

She is silent; she doesn't disclaim it; nor does she move
away but continues to stand beside him, her elbows like
his on the parapet, contemplating the River Arno whose
roar is suggesting some unexpected melody to her ears.

On a common impulse, without passing a word or look,

they turn away.

27. DAY. EXTERIOR. PIAZZA _SIGNORIA.

CHARLOTTE and LUCY are on their way back to the pension
from the bank. CHARLOTTE, with the complacency of fate,
 

30

leads them into the Piazza Signoria. LUCY hangs back
but CHARLOTTE keeps on, oblivious.

The exact site of the murder is occupied by MISS LAVISH.

She has the morning newspaper in her hand. She hails
them briskly.

MISS LAVISH
Aha! Miss Honeychurch! I'm in
luck. Now, you are to tell me
absolutely everything that you
saw from the beginning.

LUCY pokes at the ground with her parasol.

MISS LAVISH
But perhaps you would rather not?

LUCY
I'm sorry. If you could manage
without it.

The elder LADIES exchange approving glances; it is suitable
that a girl should feel deeply.

MISS LAVISH
It's I who am sorry. We literary
hacks are shameless creatures.

She marches cheerfully to the fountain and back, counting
steps.

MISS LAVISH
I've been in the Piazza since
eight o'clock, collecting material.
The two men quarrelled over a five
lira note. (in the throes of
creation, and making a dramatic
announcement) For the five lira
note I'm going to substitute a
young lady. It will raise the tone
of the tragedy.

LUCY looks uncomfortable.

CHARLOTTE
What is the plot?

MISS LAVISH
(grandly) Love, murder, abduction,
revenge! Andate via! Sono occupato!

A VENDOR of panoramic photographs has approached, holding
out his wares with a courteous smile.
31
While MISS LAVISH is engaged with the VENDOR, LUCY takes
Ne the opportunity to say to CHARLOTTE in a quick aside:
LUCY

Charlotte! Here's an idea.
What if we popped off to Rome
tomorrow - straight?

CHARLOTTE
Oh, you droll person!

MISS LAVISH
‘ I confess that in Italy my
| sympathies are not with my own
countrymen. Let me give you
| fair warning: I intend to be
unmerciful to the British tourist.

CHARLOTTE
You wicked woman! I'm sure you
are thinking of the Emersons.

MISS LAVISH continues her pacing, shadowed by the VENDOR.

» LUCY
Do let's go. I'm sick of Florence.

'

~ CHARLOTTE

! Your mother would have a fine
bone to pick with me if we left

, Florence without a single visit
to the Pitti Palace. (affec-

' tionately pressing her hand) It
was yesterday's shock - we must
put it right out of our minds.

MISS LAVISH
(returning, with the VENDOR) I
repeat and I insist: a tragedy
such as yesterday's is not the
less tragic because it happened
in humble life. Andante presto!
Presto!

She strikes at the proffered view with her rolled-up
newspaper and it tears. The VENDOR puts up a wail.
Under cover of this:

LUCY
I just want to be with you - all
the time. Promise not to leave
me. Promise.
 

32

CHARLOTTE
There, There. Your dull old
Charlotte's here.

MISS LAVISH
Ignore him.

She strides out and the VENDOR hurries after her, holding
up his damaged view, an end in each hand. OTHERS look

in their direction as the air rings with his threats and
lamentations. He appeals to LUCY. From a distance we
see him being paid off and mollified.

TITLE CARD: The Reverend Arthur Beebee, the Reverend
Cuthbert Eager, Mr. Emerson, Mr. George
Emerson, Miss Eleanor Lavish, Miss
Charlotte Bartlett and Miss Lucy Honeychurch
Drive out in Carriages to See a View;
Italians Drive them.

28. DAY. EXTERIOR. ROAD THROUGH TUSCAN LANDSCAPE.

Two carriages are driving upward to Fiesole through a
glorious landscape of flowering hills and valleys. In
the carriage in front are: MR. EAGER (the English
chaplain we already met) and MR. EMERSON, LUCY and MISS
LAVISH. Their Italian COACHMAN is young and handsome
and in a sprightly mood.

In the following carriage: MR. BEEBEE, GEORGE,
CHARLOTTE.

A beautiful Italian GIRL - Persephone personified, the
reigning goddess of the Tuscan spring - is standing
waiting at a curve of the upward winding road. She is
shielding her eyes against the sun as she looks toward
the ascending carriages. When the first carriage
reaches her, she nimbly climbs up beside the COACHMAN
and they go careering on. The COACHMAN slips the left
rein over her head, enabling him to drive with his arm
around her waist. MR. EAGER taps the COAHCMAN on the
back when he notices this.

COACHMAN
(turning around with an ingra-
tiating smile) She is my sister.

MR. EAGER
...-I'm not sure we ought to allow
this: it is the thin end of the
wedge.

The LADIES intercede on their behalf.
33

They drive on. The two GENTLEMEN have their backs to
the horses. MR. EAGER is expounding, MR. EMERSON is
falling asleep. Facing them, MISS LAVISH is listening
to MR. EAGER, and LUCY, elegantly dressed in white, is
watching the COACHMAN shamelessly making love to his
GIRL.

MR. EAGER
So, Miss Honeychurch, you are
travelling? As a student of
art?

LUCY
Oh, dear me no - oh no!

MISS LAVISH
Perhaps as a student of human
nature, like myself?

LUCY
I'm here as a tourist.

MR. EAGER
Are you indeed? If you will
not think me rude, we residents
sometimes pity you poor tourists
not a little - handed about like
a parcel of goods from Venice to
Florence, from Florence to Rome,
quite unconscious of anything
that is outside Baedeker - their
one anxiety to get "done" or
"through" and go on somewhere
else...

MISS LAVISH
(over the preceding) I abhor
Baedeker! If it were left to me,
every copy would be flung into
the Arno -

MR. EAGER
- towns, rivers, palaces, all
mixed up in one inextricable
whirl - Over there, please
observe, Miss Honeychurch, the
villa of my dear friend Lady
Helen Laverstock who is at
present busy over Fra Angelico
- a definitive study -

MISS LAVISH fixes her pincenez with eager interest but
LUCY has difficulty tearing her eyes away from the two
LOVERS on the driver's seat, who are enjoying themselves
and the ride tremendously.
34

MR, EAGER
On the right - no just there -
Mr. Henry Burrage lives. An
American of the best type - so
rare! - Doubtless you know his
Monographs in the series of
"Mediaeval Byways"? Piano!
Piano! (waving his hand
elegantly over his head with-
out turning around)

COACHMAN
Va bene, signore, va bene, va
bene.

He whips the horses up again. The dozing MR. EMERSON
is flung against MR. EAGER, who makes a long-suffering
face,

In the second carriage, MR. BEEBEE is trapped with a
silent GEORGE and a prim CHARLOTTE doing her best to
keep her hat in place as the second COACHMAN urges his
horses to keep up with the others.

MR. BEEBEE
Do you know who that is leading
us? Phaeton himself! I recog-
nized him at once. Phaeton in
Tuscany driving a cab.

CHARLOTTE
(less enthusiastic) Oh yes.
Quite. (trying to engage GEORGE
in conversation) Your father, I
believe, Mr. Emerson, is a

journalist?
GEORGE
Used to be.
CHARLOTTE
And you yourself, if I might -
GEORGE
On the railways.
CHARLOTTE
I see.
MR. BEEBEE

(hastily covering up) Phaeton
in all his classical purity,
untouched alike by the Age of
Faith and the Age of Doubt...
 

35

We see PHAETON and PERSEPHONE, the wind blowing their
hair, a young God and Goddess.

In the first carriage MR, EAGER is still talking, though
somewhat incommoded by MR. EMERSON asleep lurching
against him.

MR. EAGER
You know the American girl in
Punch who says: "Say, Poppa,
what did we see at Rome?" And
the father replies: "Why, guess
Rome was the place where we saw
the yaller dog." There's
travelling for you! Ha! hal...
Ah! What! Stop! At once!

For, turning around in an inauspicious moment, he has
caught the COACHMAN kissing his GIRL.

In his fluent but execrable Italian, MR. EAGER orders
the GIRL to be taken down from the carriage.

COACHMAN and GIRL plead and protest.
MR. EMERSON has woken up and asks what has happened.

LUCY leans forward and tells him in a whisper. He looks
pleased. The second carriage draws up behind them and
MR. BEEBEE leans out to ask what has happened.

MR. EAGER
Please - I know how to deal with
these people. (deaf to the pleas
of the lovers, he insists that
the girl must descend)

MISS LAVISH
I daresay I shall receive scant
support, but I would let them be.
I have always flown in the face
of convention all my life.

MR. EAGER
(over the above) We must not
submit. He is treating us as
if we were a party of Cook's
tourists.

This silences MISS LAVISH.

MR. EMERSON
Leave them alone. Do we find
happiness so often that we should
turn it off the box when it
happens to sit there?
 

29.

36
He pats them on the back to signify his approval.

COACHMAN
(to LUCY) Signorina!

PERSEPHONE
Signorina!

She points at the other carriage. LUCY looks and sees
GEORGE there. For a moment the two GIRLS look at each
other.

But MR. EAGER is adamant and the GIRL gets down from the
box.

They drive on - the COACHMAN now very surly and jolting
them as hard as he can. PERSEPHONE is left by the
roadside.

DAY. EXTERIOR. VARYING ASPECTS OF MOUNTAIN
SCENERY BETWEEN FIESOLE AND THE CASTELLO DI VINCIGLIATA.

The carriages have arrived, the OCCUPANTS descend. From
their eminence, they see a hollow like a great amphi-
theatre, full of terraced steps and misty olives. They
climb up into the hills, splitting off into different
groups -

MR. BEEBEE directs the COACHMAN where to place the
picnic hamper.

He is joined by MR. EAGER.

MR, EMERSON tries to have a conversation in halting
Italian with the disgruntled COACHMAN.

GEORGE is openly waiting for LUCY to join him.

But she hurries away from his uncompromising figure to
follow CHARLOTTE and MISS LAVISH -

These two are walking close together, engrossed in a
whispered conversation which sometimes breaks into
stifled laughter. They are talking about GEORGE
EMERSON's unfortunate occupation; we only catch some
of their words.

MISS LAVISH
(gasping) The railway! Oh, I
shall die! Of course it was the
railway! He is the image of a
porter - on - on the South-
Eastern.
 

30.

37

CHARLOTTE
(plucking at her) Eleanor, be
quiet. They'll hear - the
Emersons.

MISS LAVISH
(more giggling) I can't stop.
Let me go my wicked way. A
porter -

CHARLOTTE
Eleanor!

LUCY, who has been walking close enough behind them to
hear all this, speaks up with spirit:

LUCY
I'm sure it's all right. The
Emersons won't hear, and they
wouldn't mind if they did.

MISS LAVISH is not pleased by this.

MISS LAVISH
(rather crossly) Miss Honey-
church listening! Pouf! Wouf!
You naughty girl! Go away!

CHARLOTTE
Oh, Lucy, I'm sure Mr, Eager
wants to explain the landscape
to you -

LUCY
(stubbornly) I can't find him
now and I don't want to either.

They have to resign themselves to her presence.
DAY. EXTERIOR. ON_THE ROAD.

GEROGE has remained by the carriages. He draws a large
question mark in the dirt with a stick. Then he wipes
it out and instead draws the letters Y E S.

Abruptly he plunges down the bank away from the others
and, cheerful and athletic, makes his way to an
eminence overlooking the Val D'Arno and distant
Florence. He tries out the echo.

At first he gives an "Ooooh!" sound, but then replaces
it with these words which now ring over the hillside:
 

31.

38

GEORGE
(shouting) Liberty - Truth -
Beauty - Love!

DAY. EXTERIOR. LITTLE VALLEY.

32.

The words resound among the tea-cups of the two
CLERGYMEN and MR. EMERSON around the hamper.

MR. BEEBEE
Is that your son? Could it
be the silent, dour George?

MR. EMERSON
He's saying his creed.

MR. EAGER
One more lump, if I might
trouble you, Mr. Beebee, thank
you.
GEORGE'S VOICE: "Beauty!"

MR, EMERSON
He is declaring the eternal Yes.

MR, EAGER
And a spoon, if there is one.

GEORGE'S VOICE: "Love!"

DAY. EXTERIOR. BEAUTIFUL SPOT #2.

GEORGE'S VOICE (or its echo) also reaches the three
LADIES.

Only LUCY is attentive to it.
MISS LAVISH is busy spreading two mackintosh squares.
CHARLOTTE
From Weybridge, you say? How
very odd.
MISS LAVISH
Weybridge, Surrey - on her very
first visit to Italy.
GEORGE'S VOICE: "Love!"

Lucy
What's that?
39

CHARLOTTE
Oh, the gentlemen are doubltess
having a game - why don't you
go and find them?

LUCY
Because I want to stop here
with you.

MISS LAVISH

(lowering herself onto a
mackintosh square) Observe my
foresight: I never venture out
without my mackintosh squares

for at any time one may have to
sit on damp ground or cold marble.

CHARLOTTE
Lucy - take the other one: the
ground will do for me.

LUCY protests - in vain; CHARLOTTE sits on the ground.

CHARLOTTE
Really, I have not had rheumatism
for years, and if I do feel it
coming on, I shall stand up...
And she never went back to Weybridge?

MISS LAVISH
Her friend had to return alone
while she remained in Monteriano.

CHARLOTTE
And she really -

MISS LAVISH nods but cannot say more because of LUCY's
presence,

CHARLOTTE
(clearing her throat) Now don't
be alarmed; this isn't a cold.
It's the tiniest cough, and I
have had it three days. It's
nothing to do with sitting here

at all.

LUCY
Oh very well: I shall join Mr.
Eager.

CHARLOTTE

Do, dear; he will be pleased.
(hardly waiting for her to be
out of earshot) And she really
married this Italian?
33.

34.

40

MISS LAVISH
In the church at Monteriano. A
youth ten years younger than
herself.

DAY. EXTERIOR. BY THE ROAD.

LUCY, in search of the others, addresses herself to the
COACHMEN who are sprawling in the carriages, smoking
cigars.

LUCY
Dove?

The first COACHMAN nods at her radiantly.

LUCY
(struggling with her Italian)
Dove buoni uomini?

He knows perfectly. He is ready and able to conduct her.
He adjusts his hat, encourages his moustache, and with
the graciousness of a host invites her to follow him.
She does so, for the first time really enjoying the
landscape.

DAY. EXTERIOR. BEAUTIFUL SPOT #2.

CHARLOTTE and MISS LAVISH on their mackintosh squares.
They are now in a pensive mood.

MISS LAVISH
«-.I have a theory that there is
something in the Italian landscape
which inclines even the most stolid
nature to romance.

CHARLOTTE
(regarding landscape) It reminds
me somewhat of the country around
Shropshire where I once spent a
holiday at the home of my friend,
Miss Apesbury.

MISS LAVISH
And - I divine it - Charlotte, you
had an adventure there! Vain to
deny it!

CHARLOTTE is blushing, confused, happy under MISS
LAVISH's teasing.

DAY. EXTERIOR. ON THE WAY TO EMINENCE.

COACHMAN stops to pick some violets and presents them
to LUCY. She takes them with real pleasure. They walk
on. The view is forming - LUCY sees the river, the
golden plain, other hills.

COACHMAN
Eccolo!

LUCY gives a cry - the ground has given way and she falls
on to a little terrace, covered with violets from end to
end. It is like a sea of violets, foaming down the
hillside.

Standing on the brink of this sea, like a swimmer about
to dive, is GEORGE.

GEORGE contemplates LUCY - who appears to have fallen out
of heaven into this sea of violets which beats against
her dress in blue waves.

The COACHMAN watches them from behind the bushes, a
violet between his teeth.

GEORGE steps forward quickly and kisses LUCY (on the
cheek).

CHARLOTTE'S VOICE calling: "Lucy! Lucy!"

They look up and see her standing brown against the view.
Then CHARLOTTE spies the COACHMAN in the bushes. He
stares at all three, maybe laughing unabashedly.

DAY. EXTERIOR. DESCENDING FROM FIESOLE.

The clouds are massing over the landscape in a
threatening way. There is distant thunder. The wind
has come up.

CHARLOTTE, holding on to LUCY, asks MISS LAVISH to go in
the other carriage and pointedly asks MR. EAGER to get
in with them. When he has done so, and before GEORGE
can take his place, CHARLOTTE tells the COACHMAN #1
("PHAETON") to start out. LUCY cries out and stands up
as the carriage moves, until she is pulled down to
safety.

The OCCUPANTS of the other carriage begin to rearrange
themselves to make room for GEORGE. Instead of getting
in, he waves them on good-naturedly. The second
carriage goes.
 

37.

42

GEORGE
(shouting after it to his father)
I'll walk.

MR. EMERSON protests, points to the threatening sky,
but GEORGE sturdily strides off.

The carriages rattle off, MR. EMERSON continuing to
shout to GEORGE to induce him to ride with them.

But GEORGE cheerfully waves them on.
DAY. EXTERIOR. ON THE ROAD.

The storm is gathering. GEORGE seems to enjoy it -
eagerly looking up as though inviting the elements to
break,

When the rain begins to pour down, he takes off his hat
and raises his face to the rain and lets it soak into
him.

DAY. EXTERIOR. FIESOLE ROAD.

In the carriage, CHARLOTTE and LUCY are huddled together
under an inadequate parasol. Their hands are inter-
twined. LUCY now appears to be clinging to CHARLOTTE
for protection.

Rain and darkness have come on together. There is a
flash of lightning and LUCY screams. MR. EAGER addresses
her professionaly:

MR, EAGER
Courage, Miss Honeychurch, courage
and faith. Do you suppose that
all this immense electrical display
is simply called into existence
to extinguish you or me?

Lucy
No - of course -

MR. EAGER
Even from the scientific standpoint
the chances against our being
struck are enormous. The steel
picnic knives, the only articles
which might attract the current,
are in the other carriage. And,
in any case...

There is an explosion on the road. The storm has struck
the overhead wire of the tramline and one of the great
43

supports falls moments before the carriages arrive at
the spot. They stop.

Everyone descends from the carriages and embrace each
other joyfully. It has been a miraculous preservation.
The COACHMEN shout in wonder and cross themselves.

Very excited, MR. EMERSON insists they must return to
pick up GEORGE.

MR. EMERSON
The boy may lose his way! He
may be killed!

MR. BEEBEE and MR. EAGER attempt to calm him.

MR. EAGER
(gently) We must have faith.

There is a great crash of thunder.

MR. EMERSON
(appealing to MISS LAVISH) But
he may be killed!

MR. EAGER
(sotto voce to MR. BEEBEE, as
he is helping the other LADIES
back into the carriage) Typical
behaviour. In the presence of
reality that kind of person
invariably breaks down.

MR. BEEBEE
The old gentleman is anxious
for his son.

They lead him to the other carriage and put him into it.

LUCY, CHARLOTTE, and their COACHMAN are again huddled in
their carriage.

CHARLOTTE
(pointing to COACHMAN, whispering)
He saw - but you may leave him to
me.

She taps his back. He turns around. She fumbles in her
purse - then proffers him a franc.

CHARLOTTE
(finger on lip) Silenzio!

He turns back, pocketing the franc.

CHARLOTTE
Don't cry, dearest.

Lucy
«+.I have been worse than you
know...Once by the river - the
day of the murder -

CHARLOTTE
Yes? What? Speak, dear!

LUCY
+.Oh but he isn't killed - he
wouldn't be killed, would he?
Charlotte!

CHARLOTTE
I trust not. One would always
pray against that.

MR. EAGER gets back in. He gives them a sharp look, as
if he suspects something.

The carriages ride on, LUCY's tears mingling with the
rain.

NIGHT. INTERIOR. PENSION PASSAGE AND STAIRS,

CHARLOTTE is arguing with the cockney SIGNORA who is
demanding a whole week's rent.

CHARLOTTE is firm in offering half a week's rent - Then
walks sedately up the stairs, not turning around or
quickening her step in spite of the SIGNORA's protests
pursuing her.

NIGHT. INTERIOR. THE ROOM WITH A VIEW.

Half-packed suitcases and a trunk stand open. The rain
is pouring down outside. One candle burns on a chest of
drawers, casting monstrous and fantastic shadows on the
bolted door as CHARLOTTE brushes LUCY's hair, making
her hand with the brush appear like the threatening
appendage of some giant insect, raising and lowering.
Out of the sound of the rain and the brushing we finally
hear CHARLOTTE speak:

CHARLOTTE
So what is to be done?

No answer. The brushing continues.
 

45

CHARLOTTE
What is to be done. You alone
can decide.

A tram roars by in the dark. LUCY looks sad and finally
says:

LUCY
It has been raining for nearly
four hours.

CHARLOTTE ignores this and continues brushing with
determination. She doesn't do it well and frequently
pulls LUCY's hair. But LUCY is in her power.

CHARLOTTE

How do you propose to silence him?
LUCY

The driver?
CHARLOTTE

My dear girl, no. Mr. George
Emerson. I don't wish to judge
him uncharitably - but I know:
he will talk.

Lucy
He will not! He never talks!
One is fortunate to get as much
as a yes or a no out of him.

CHARLOTTE
Unfortunately I have met the
type before. (looking at
CHARLOTTE it's hard to believe
this and LUCY doesn't) They
seldom keep their exploits to
themselves.

LUCY
(wincing from the word, not the
tugs) Exploits?

CHARLOTTE looks grim with superior knowledge.
LUCY
(getting up suddenly and going
to the window) Very well, I‘'1l
speak to him.

CHARLOTTE utters a cry of alarm at this.
She turns
CHARLOTTE

46

LUCY
(peering out of the window) He
should have been here at least
an hour ago; even if he did walk
all the way.

CHARLOTTE
Come away from the window, dear;
you will be seen from the road.

LUCY
«.«eThe moment he comes, I shall
face him,

CHARLOTTE

You will do no such thing. My
poor dear, you are so young,
you have always lived among
such nice people ... This
afternoon, for example, if I
had not arrived, what would
have happened?

LUCY
(very gravely) I can't think.

her back - to hide what expression on her face?
looks at her back, then persists:

CHARLOTTE
Answer me, Lucia: What would
have happened if I had not
appeared?

LUCY
(wheeling round to her, now
frankly laughing) I told you:
I can't think. You did appear.

CHARLOTTE
«..0 for your brother! If only
Freddy were here: he is young,
but I know that his sister's
insult would rouse in him a very
lion. (kneeling humbly by LUCY's
suitcase, painfully packing in
silence for a while) ...I have
vexed you at every turn.

LUCY makes an exclamation.

CHARLOTTE
Yes, yes - it is so. I'm too
old for you and too dull; only
(MORE)
47

CHARLOTTE (contd)
fit to pack and unpack your
things...It will be a push to
catch the morning train, but
we must try.

Lucy
(dully) When does the train to
Rome go?
CHARLOTTE
At eight.
CHARLOTTE gets up.
CHARLOTTE

I have failed in my duty to
your mother. She will never
forgive me, and rightly.

With this uncompromising statement, she resumes her
packing. But all her busyness, moving around the room,
cannot hide the fact that she is alert to what LUCY is
going to answer. LUCY answers nothing. She has resumed
her watch by the window.

CHARLOTTE
Your mother has been so generous
to me; I shall never face her
again, after this disaster.

LUCY feels compelled to turn her attention again from
the window to CHARLOTTE.

CHARLOTTE
I am here for your sake - by
your mother's generosity - yet
I have neglected you. Your
mother will see this as clearly
as I do, when you tell her. Do
come away from the window.

She struggles with the strap of LUCY's suitcase.

LUCY, realising that a new point has been made, goes
over to her.

CHARLOTTE
She will certainly blame me when
she hears of it. (tightening
strap) Certainly and deservedly.

LUCY
Why need mother hear of it?
 

48

CHARLOTTE
But you tell her everything...
(pause) Don't you?

LUCY
I suppose I do generally.

CHARLOTTE
There is such beautiful confi-
dence between you - one would
not want to break it. And, as
I have said, I am to blame.

LUCY
I wouldn't wish Mother to think
so.

CHARLOTTE
She will think so...If you tell
her.

A pause. Then LUCY says - unwillingly but with
resolution:

LUCY
I will never speak of it, either
to Mother or to anyone. I
promise I will not.

CHARLOTTE has successfully ended her struggle with the
strap. She gets up with satisfaction. She pecks LUCY
on both cheeks.

CHARLOTTE
Better get to bed, dear. We
have to make an early start.

She goes. As she is closing the door, preposterously
she points at the bolt (or key) and by gesture tells
LucY to lock it. Then she shuts the door. We hear her
footsteps in the corridor. But LUCY doesn't move.

She sits on the side of her bed. Youthful joy has
drained out of her face.

The doorbell rings. LUCY starts.

41. NIGHT. INTERIOR. ROOM WITH A VIEW - CHARLOTTE'S.

CHARLOTTE stops her packing - she is lining the bottom
of a trunk with books - and goes to the window.

42. NIGHT. INTERIOR. ROOM WITH A VIEW - LUCY'S.

So does LUCY in her room. But she first blows out her
candle.
49

43. NIGHT. EXTERIOR. PENSION.
GEORGE, who is standing outside the door, looks up.
But, since LUCY is in the dark, it is only CHARLOTTE
he sees at the window.
A MAID SERVANT opens the door to him.
He is very wet but radiant. He greets the SERVANT with
such warmth that she smiles broadly back to him.
44. NIGHT. INTERIOR. ROOM WITH A VIEW - LUCY'S.
LUCY hears him coming up the stairs.
After a moment's hesitation, she strides to the door and
opens it boldly.
45. NIGHT. INTERIOR. UPSTAIRS PASSAGE.
GEORGE sees LUCY appearing at the door.
But at the same moment the adjoining door opens and
CHARLOTTE appears.
Now LUCY closes her door. (The effect of the two figures
alternately appearing and disappearing is like that of
the two figures in a clock.)
CHARLOTTE
I wish one word with you in the
drawing room, Mr. Emerson, please.
She leads the way to the drawing room. He follows her.
46. NIGHT. INTERIOR. ROOM WITH A VIEW - LUCY'S.

LUCY is getting undressed in a great hurry, breathing
heavily with strong and angry feelings.

She hears footsteps and then CHARLOTTE's voice: "Good
night, Mr. Emerson."

LUCY listens to GEORGE's footsteps recede. Then there
is absolute silence.

In an access of fury, LUCY flings her hairbrush against
the wall.

CHARLOTTE'S VOICE
Lucy?

LUCY climbs into bed and pulls the covers over her head.
47.

 

50

NIGHT. INTERIOR. ROOM WITH A VIEW - CHARLOTTE'S.

48.

CHARLOTTE taps on the wall.

CHARLOTTE
Go to bed at once, dear. You
need all the rest you can get.

CHARLOTTE begins her own night preparations. She takes
off her rings and ranges them on the pincushion; she
blows into her gloves. And when she removes her dress
we see her money belt or money pouch, an ungainly
utilitarian object from which she extracts a wad of
bills to count. She unpins her hair; when it is loose,
she looks at her face in the mirror. Her loosened hair
does not make her look younger; on the contrary, for it
is thinning, and there are some grey strands in it which
she picks out in the mirror.

But after a moment she stops doing that, and instead
covers her face with her hands. She sits there - very
still, rigid, and alone. The rain goes on falling.

TITLE CARD: THE BETROTHAL

DAY. EXTERIOR. "WINDY CORNER" IN ITS SURREY
SETTING.
"Windy Corner" - the Honeychurch house. It is built on

a range of hills overlooking the Weald. It stands not on
the summit of the ridge but a few hundred feet down the
southern slope. There are ravines surrounding it filled
with ferns and pine trees.

The situation of the house is exquisite - the house very
much less so. This is no Stately Home, or architecturally
interesting Manor that would be illustrated in Country
Life. It is a rather ugly, commodious, late Victorian
house - spacious enough for the Honeychurch family and
servants, but not imposing to connoisseurs of country
houses or English country life. Yet it is so obviously
a family house, built to satisfy comfort and personal
taste and not someone else's architectural pretensions,
that it does not mar its beautiful setting but enhances,
completes, humanises it.

Having viewed the house from a distance, we draw near -
into the Garden, which is very ordinary, with trees,
flower beds, a terrace, a rustic seat, but is trans—-
figured by the magnificent view stretching beyond it.

Two figures are seated on the garden seat: LUCY and
CECIL. ‘They are in the classic pose of knight preferring
49.

51

his suit and maiden hiding her blushes - indeed, they
might be posing for a painting entitled The Proposal.

DAY. INTERIOR. HONEYCHURCH DRAWING ROOM,

From the garden we enter the drawing room of the house:
here there are two other figures -

One of these, MRS. HONEYCHURCH, is surreptitiously
peeping out between the drawn curtains at the COUPLE

in the garden. The other - FREDDY HONEYCHURCH - is
somewhat ostentatiously minding his own business: that
is, he is studying a human bone which he has propped on
the piano and an accompanying text in a medical text-
book.

MRS. HONEYCHURCH
I think things are coming to a
head.

FREDDY
I don't see you ought to go
peeping like that.

MRS. HONEYCHURCH
Peeping like what? Can't I look
out of my own window?... (coming
over to glance at his book)
Still page 322.

FREDDY snorts and turns over two pages.

MRS. HONEYCHURCH
You know, Cecil actually asked
my permission. I was so amused.
He's always gone in for unconven-
tionality, and parents nowhere,
and so forth. But when it comes
to the point, he can't get on
without me.

FREDDY
Nor me...He asked me for my
permission also.

MRS. HONEYCHURCH
You?

FREDDY nods.
MRS. HONEYCHURCH

How very odd - whatever did you
say?
52

FREDDY
I said "No" - There! Fly into
a stew! I can't help it! It's
the way he put it - didn't I
think it was a splendid thing
for Lucy if he married her and
wasn't I off my head with joy.
So I said no, I wasn't.

MRS. HONEYCHURCH
Ridiculous child! You think
you're so holy and truthful but
really it's only abominable
conceit -

FREDDY
Look out!

For the curtains have parted and CECIL has entered.

CECIL
(declaiming dramatically) I
promessi sposi.

They fail to understand him. They stare at him. Now
that we see him close-up, CECIL still looks like a knight
- not a romantic one but one stretched out on a tomb or
guarding the portals of a French cathedral. He is tall
and refined, thin, Gothic, fastidious, sexless.

CECIL
(translating for their benefit)
She has accepted me.

MRS. HONEYCHURCH
(after a short silence - over-
effusively) I am so glad. Dear
Cecil, what joy. Welcome as one
of the family!

CECIL
(shifting his eyes to the ceiling)
Thank you.

FREDDY puts down his bone and proffers a hand stained
yellow by chemicals. CECIL gingerly accepts it.

But there is LUCY calling from the garden.
MRS. HONEYCHURCH and FREDDY run out to her - CECIL

watches them - amused, perhaps rather touched by their
demonstrativeness. He lights a cigarette.
53

The MAID appears at the door to announce MR, BEEBEE - who
is in the room before she has finished.

MR. BEEBEE
Ah, Mr. Vyse. I've come for tea.
Do you suppose I shall get it?

CECIL
Food is the one thing one does
get here - don't sit in that
chair; young Honeychurch has
left a bone in it.

MR. BEEBEE
Pfui! Freddy really is terrible
- a most unpromising youth. So
unlike his sister.

CECIL _
(eager to talk about his fiancee)
You think his sister is "promising"?

MR. BEEBEE
(sitting down, glad to expatiate)
«»-I have a pet theory about Miss
Honeychurch.

CECIL looks encouragingly at MR. BEEBEE in expectation
of hearing the theory.

MR. BEEBEE
Does it seem reasonable to you
that she should play so wonder-
fully - play Beethoven with such
passion - and yet live so quietly?
«-.I suspect that the day will
come when music and life will
mingle, and then she will be
wonderful in both.

CECIL
(simply and sincerely) Well, Mr.
Beebee - I trust that day is at
hand: she has just promised to
marry me.

MR. BEEBEE does not take this news in at once - and
when he does, he expresses not the joy Cecil has
anticipated but looks disappointed, put out.

There is an awkward silence.
CECIL

(dryly) I'm sorry if I've given
you a shock.
50.

51.

 

54

MR. BEEBEE
(pulling himself together) I'm
sorry; I must apologise. I had
no idea you were intimate with
her ~ Mr. Vyse, you ought to have
stopped me -

The others have spotted MR. BEEBEE from the garden.
They call to him, asking "What do you think of our
news!

MR. BEEBEE is glad to resolve the awkward moment - he
puts his arms around CECIL, now smiling, and leads him
out.

DAY. EXTERIOR. HONEYCHURCH GARDEN,

MR. BEEBEE
(calling) Congratulations!
Blessings! Your vicar's
benediction!

In one hand he has FREDDY's bone which he throws to him
~ FREDDY catches it.

MR. BEEBEE
(as he goes out to them) I want
them all their lives to be
supremely good and supremely
happy as husband and wife, as
father and mother. And now I
want my tea.

Everyone is now happy and smiling in the garden which is
like a green magic carpet hovering in the air above the
tremulous world of the Weald stretching beyond it.

TITLE CARD: LUCY AS A WORK OF ART

DAY. INTERIOR. MRS. BUTTERWORTH DRAWING ROOM.

A decorous tea party in a Summer Street drawing room.
The social level is at the point where country merges
into suburban society.

CECIL and LUCY are the centre piece of the occasion,
which is in honour of their engagement.

MRS. HONEYCHURCH is of course present. The other faces
are new to us. These include SIR HARRY OTWAY, the local
squire. All beam approval on the YOUNG COUPLE.

Some (partly) background conversation from SIR HARRY:
 

55

SIR HARRY
There was some difference of
opinion with the builder whose
idea of a Corinthian column was
not exactly classical...

Interjections from other GUESTS - e.g.

1. You can hardly expect that sort
of person to have any conception
of the orders of architecture.

2. It would be comic if it weren't
so tragic. (etc.)

SIR HARRY
I hinted that a column should
be structural as well as
decorative, and he informed me
that they had all been ordered
and were all in a different
style - one with dragons, another
in the Ionian style - a third
introducing his wife's initials.
Most unfortunate, but what could
I do?

MRS. HONEYCHURCH
Sir Harry, I think you should
just pull the whole thing down.

SIR HARRY
That might be desirable but, alas,
is hardly practical.

Simultaneously with the description of the columns, a

clumsy young PARLOUR MAID is bringing in tea things -

The hostess, MRS. BUTTERWORTH, keeps an anxious eye on
her.

MRS. HONEYCHURCH
Isn't that our Mary's niece Maggie?

MRS. BUTTERWORTH
She has been helping out the past
two days - I hope she will turn
out more - (to MAID) No, there,
not here - (from the unsatis-
factory MAID she looks at CECIL
and whispers) I do congratulate
you, Mrs. Honeychurch: a most
distinguished and agreeable young
man.
56

But CECIL, balancing plate and cup, looks more distin-
guished than agreeable: he is not enjoying the
occasion.

SIR HARRY
What I fear most is that the
villa will attract the wrong
type of tenant. It is too
large for the peasant class,
and too small for anyone the
least like ourselves.

CECIL
It might be a paradise for a
bank-clerk.

SIR HARRY
(excitedly) Exactly! That is
exactly what I fear, Mr. Vyse.
It will attract the wrong
type of people. The train
service has improved - a fatal
improvement to my mind.

Other GUESTS murmur "Quite" and "Rather unfortunate" to
indicate their understanding of the problem.

LUCY
Sir Harry - how would you like
spinsters?

SIR HARRY
Most certainly - if they are
gent lewomen.

LUCY

Oh indeed they are, though at
present homeless. I heard from
them last week - Miss Teresa
and Miss Catherine Alan - I met
them in Italy -

MRS. HONEYCHURCH
Sir Harry, beware of these gentle-
women: they are certain to have
canaries: they spit the seed out
through the bars of the cages, and
then the mice come. Beware of
women altogether and only let to
aman - provided of course he is
clean.

LUCY
Mother, you would be the first to
love the Miss Alans.
52.

57

MRS. HONEYCHURCH
I don't know if I would love
anyone from that pension of
yours. Wasn't there a lady
novelist, too - and a free-
thinking father and his son?

Just then the clumsy MAID upsets tea over LUCY's new
figured silk -

There is general consternation - advice - offers of
help - Finally MRS. HONEYCHURCH takes LUCY away to wipe
her dress -

CECIL looks after them rather wildly, wishing he could
follow.

MRS. BUTTERWORTH
Let me see, Mr. Vyse - I forget
- what is your profession?

CECIL
I have no profession.

Polite murmurs.

CECIL
My attitude - quite an indefensible
one - is that so long as I am no
trouble to anyone, I have a right
to do as I like. It is, I dare say,
an example of my decadence.

Some clearing of throats, some more polite murmurs.

SIR HARRY
(in an attempt to save the day)
You are very fortunate. The
possession of leisure is a wonderful
opportunity.

DAY. INTERIOR. DRESSING ROOM.

MRS. HONEYCHURCH, on her knees, is energetically swabbing
LUCY's dress.

LUCY
That's enough, Mother. Please,
it's all right... (more high-
pitched) Leave it, Mother!

MRS. HONEYCHURCH sits back on her heels and looks up at
LUCY as if asking what is the matter.
58

LUCY
«Why did you say all that about
the Miss Alans. They're charming
and kind, and you will like them.

MRS. HONEYCHURCH
If you do, I'm sure I shall. And
also of course the lady novelist
and the freethinking father -
very well, dear, I'll be serious.
Write to the Miss Alans, offer
them Sir Harry's villa -

LUCY
(interrupting her with what is
really on her mind) You do approve
of Cecil, don't you, Mother? I
mean, you like him?

MRS. HONEYCHURCH
(getting up) I told you, dear:
everyone that you like, that you
love...

LUCY still looks dubious: it's not as affirmative an
answer as she'd hoped for.

53. DAY. INTERIOR. MRS. BUTTERWORTH DRAWING ROOM.

CECIL is still holding forth to an increasingly
embarrassed company. It is as if he is carried away
on wings of his own boredom and arrogance and can't
stop himself:

CECIL
«.eI'm shockingly stupid over
local affairs. It is very remiss
of me - but I only go into the
country to see my friends and
enjoy the scenery. Italy and
London are the places where I
feel I truly belong -

To his relief ~ to everyone's relief - LUCY and MRS.
HONEYCHURCH return -

CECIL
(jumping up) Mrs. Honeychurch,
what if Lucy and I walk home and
leave you?

No one thinks this rude but everyone smiles with
pleasure at the impatience of a lover. ("Young people,

young people.")
54.

59

MRS. HONEYCHURCH
By all means, leave me to my tea
and gossip and these delicious
scones =

The older people seem as relieved to get rid of the
young as these are to leave.

LUCY goes through the form of thanking and good-bying -
CECIL hardly has the patience.

DAY. EXTERIOR. SUMMER STREET.

Summer Street is a pretty little village arranged around
a meadow. There are attractive cottages, a few older
substantial houses from the eighteenth century, and MR.
BEEBEE's church, which looks new and expensively simple.
But the charming scene is marred by two ugly little
villas, speculator built, raw and out of place. These
little houses have names on them - one is called "Albert"
and the other is "Cissie." The first is inhabited and
has lace curtains in its front windows and a well-tended
handkerchief-size lawn. The second is empty ahd has
three "“To-Let" signs in front of it.

As soon as they are outside -

CECIL
How perfectly appalling;
disastrous.

LUCY
I'm so sorry.

CECIL
It's so disgusting, the way an
engagement is regarded as public
property!

LUCY
One has to go through it, I
suppose. They won't notice us
so very much next time.

But she has nothing more to offer on the subject. They
walk along and come to the church, the rectory, and Sir
Harry's villa.

MR. BEEBEE is seen leaning over the gate of the rectory,
smoking a peaceful pipe.

CECIL
There's your philosophising
parson.
 

60

LUCY
Don't you like Mr. Beebee either?

He begins to protest -

But instead of listening to him, LUCY approaches MR.
BEEBEE.

LUCY
Oh, Mr. Beebee, I've had such a
wonderful idea: I'm going to
write to our Miss Alans - Miss
Teresa and Miss Catherine - and
ask them to take Sir Harry's
villa.

CECIL
(looking at villa) Is that it?

MR. BEEBEE
Rather horrible, isn't it?...
But I'm sure the Miss Alans have
read their Ruskin and will like it.

CECIL
In my opinion, Sir Harry deserves
a tenant as vulgar as his villa.

LUCY
Oh, Cecil! Really, he's very
nice.

CECIL

I can't help it. It would be
wrong not to loathe that man.
Gentlewomen! Ugh!

LUCY is in a hurry to draw CECIL away.

LUCY
(to MR. BEEBEE) I'11 write to
them, and if you would also send
a word -

MR. BEEBEE hardly has time to agree before they are out
of earshot.

LUCY
Goodness, how cross you are.

CECIL
It was that miserable tea-party.
And all those dreadful people.
And not being alone with you.
55.

 

61

They have now reached the woods surrounding the village.
LUCY stops by a diverging footpath:

LUCY
Which way shall we go?...Perhaps
the road is more sensible, as we
are got up smart.

It's true. They are. A pause.

CECIL
«»-Do you know, Lucy, that since
we were engaged, you have never
once been with me in the fields
or the wood?

LUCY
Haven't I? The wood, then.

She leads the way into the wood.
DAY. EXTERIOR. woop.

LUCY loves being here so much that she forgets she is
not alone. She makes her way, sprightly as a wood numph
- while CECIL has difficulty keeping up with her.

When she has disappeared from his sight, he calls to her.
While waiting for her, he sits on a tree-stump, thereby
making it look like a drawing room chair.

When she comes back for him -

CECIL
...I have a strange feeling that
you feel more at home with me in
a room...Never in the real country
like this.

LUCY

Oh, Cecil, whatever do you mean?
You talk as if I was a poetess
sort of person... (looking at
him perched there, she suddenly
bursts out laughing) How funny!
Do you know that you're right?
When I think of you, it's always
in a room.

Laughing, she walks on, swift and sure. He straggles
behind her, not looking pleased. She has come to a
little clearing among the pines. There is a shallow
pool.
 

62

She stands looking at it with pleasure. It takes him
some time to catch up with her. When he joins her -

LUCY
This is the Sacred Lake...

CECIL
It's more a puddle than a lake.

LUCY
Yes but after heavy rains it
fills up and becomes quite large
and beautiful...Freddy loves to
bathe here. He's very fond of
the Sacred Lake.

CEIL
And you?

Lucy
(dreamily) ...I bathed here too
till I was found out. Then
there was a row.

He looks at her smiling dreamily by the pool's edge.
Forster wrote that "...she reminded him of some brilliant
flower that has no leaves of its own, but blooms abruptly
out of a world of green..."

CECIL
«-eLucy!

LUCY
Yes, I suppose we ought to be
going.

But instead he moves up closer to her.

CECIL
Lucy, I want to ask something of
you that I have never asked before.

Lucy
(looking up at him frankly and
kindly) What, Cecil? (a pause)
Yes?

CECIL
(visibly overcoming his embar-
rassment and looking around to
see if they're observed) Up to
now I have never kissed you.
 

56.

63

LUCY
(stammering in embarrassment not
at the request but at his
clumsiness) No - you haven't.

CECIL
May I now?

LUCY
Of course you may, Cecil. You
might before. I can't run at
you, you know.

She gives a business-like lift to her veil and dutifully
raises her face.

After some hesitation, he brings his own down to it - But
at the crucial moment his gold pincenez becomes dislodged
and is flattened between them.

It is a very unsatisfactory moment for both of them.
They walk away from the Sacred Lake in embarrassed
silence. It is she who finally speaks:

LUCY
You know, Mother is right...
Those people Charlotte and I
met at the pension -

CECIL
What people at what pension?

LUCY
The Pension Bertolini in Florence.
They were - all of them - rather
extraordinary.

CECIL
(stiffly) I don't follow the
sequence of your thoughts.

LUCY
They have no sequence. They
never do.
DAY. EXTERIOR. ROAD.

Now they have reached the road again - and appear once
again a decorous Engaged Couple got up smart and walking
home from a tea party.

TITLE CARD: IN MRS. VYSE'S WELL-APPOINTED FLAT

NIGHT. EXTERIOR. LONDON RESIDENTIAL STREET
WITH SOME CABS AND MOTORCARS,

There is still light in the sky, but the electric and/or
gas lights have been turned on in street and houses.

It is a solid, upper middle-class neighborhood somewhere
in Kensington of expensive mansion flats. Their tall
brick facades loom.

NIGHT. INTERIOR. LONDON DRAWING ROOM OF THE VYSE'S.

LUCY is playing the piano for a party of the VYSE's
FRIENDS, mostly smart-looking younger people. She plays
magnificently, though not Beethoven. The music throbs,
affecting the audience. CECIL listens with proprietory
pleasure. MRS. VYSE, a worldly hostess, is pleased to
see her party and future daughter-in-law such a success.

NIGHT. INTERIOR. CORRIDOR OF VYSE APPARTMENT.

CECIL and LUCY are saying goodnight outside her door.
She creeps into his arms.

LUCY
Cecil - Cecil darling.

CECIL
(very affectionate and deomon-
strative for him) So you do love
me, little thing?

LUCY
Oh, Cecil, I don't know what I
should do without you.

NIGHT. INTERIOR. LONDON DRAWING ROOM OF THE VYSE'S.

CECIL comes back from seeing LUCY to bed to his mother.
MRS. VYSE is pacing up and down like a general in his
War Room. She turns to CECIL as he enters and says
dramatically:

MRS. VYSE
Make Lucy one of us. Lucy is
becoming wonderful - wonderful!

CECIL
Her music always was wonderful.

MRS. VYSE
Yes, but she is purging off the
Honeychurch taint - most excellent,
Honeychurches, but you know what

65

MRS. VYSE (contd)
I mean - She's not always quoting
servants or asking one how the
pudding is made. Cecil, mind you
marry her next January!

CECIL
Her music! The style of her!
How she kept to Schubert when,
like an idiot, I wanted Beethoven.
Schubert was right for this
evening. Do you know, Mother, I
shall have our children educated
just like Lucy. Bring them up
among honest country folk for
freshness, send them to Italy for
subtlety, and then - not till then
- bring them to London.

MRS. VYSE
Make her one of us!

NIGHT. INTERIOR. LUCY'S BEDROOM AT THE VYSE'S.

LUCY is asleep in bed. She is having a dream.

Lucy's Dream:

DAY. EXTERIOR. TUSCAN LANDSCAPE.

63.

She sees the Italian COACHMAN, He is leading her down
the hillside.

He parts a hedge. She sees a sea of violets and a FIGURE
on a precipice.

NIGHT. INTERIOR, MRS. VYSE'S BEDROOM AND CORRIDOR.
MRS. VYSE, lying in bed, hears a cry. She gets up.
Putting on a dressing gown, she goes swiftly to Lucy's
room - She opens the door.
NIGHT, INTERIOR. LUCY'S BEDROOM.
LUCY is sitting up in bed, with her hand to her cheek.
LUCY
I'm so sorry, Mrs. Vyse. It's
these dreams.

MRS. VYSE
Bad dreams?
65.

 

66

LUCY
Just dreams.

MRS. VYSE
(smiling and kissing her) You
should have heard us talking about
you, dear. He admires you more
than ever. Dream of that.

LUCY returns the kiss, still holding her hand to her
cheek and MRS. VYSE withdraws.

TITLE CARD: CECIL AS A HUMORIST
DAY. EXTERIOR. TENNIS LAWN AT WINDY CORNER.

A rowdy, rumbustious game of Bumble-puppy is in progress:
consisting of striking tennis balls high into the air, so
that they fall over the net and bounce very hard. It is
being played by LUCY and MINNIE, MR. BEEBEE's 13-year-old
niece, with FREDDY acting alternately as referee and
co-player.

Two stout, middle-aged figures - MR. BEEBEE and MRS.
HONEYCHURCH - sit watching placidly. Sometimes a ball
bounces among them, even hits them. MRS. HONEYCHURCH
protests, but in vain. She is also keeping score and
commenting on the game absent-mindedly.

MRS. HONEYCHURCH
I hate that game - it turns
perfectly nice children into
savages. Here, Minnie...
(tossing ball to her)

MR, BEEBEE

It's good of you to let Minnie
come and be a savage at Windy
Corner: life in the rectory is
too staid for my niece. I'm
trying to get Lucy's attention
for this letter - from the Miss
Alans -

MRS. HONEYCHURCH
Those tiresome Miss Alans! I
hate their "if"-ing and "but"-ing -

MR. BEEBEE
But they really are coming now.
Miss Teresa enquired how often
the butcher called, and my reply
must have impressed her favourably
- Lucy! (waving letter) They
really are coming!
 

fad

67

LUCY
Who is?...No, Minnie! Not that
ball! That doesn't count!

FREDDY _
That ball's all right for Bumble-
puppy! Minnie, don't listen to
her!

LUCY
It doesn't bounce!

FREDDY
It bounces enough - that's right,
Minnie, go for her - get her over
the shins with the racket - get
her over the shins!

FREDDY possesses to a high degree the power to lash
little girls to fury. MINNIE howls, LUCY shrieks and
falls down, the ball rolls away, FREDDY grabs it, etc.

MR. BEEBEE and MRS. HONEYCHURCH cry out in protest - but
the PLAYERS are getting all entangled now, grabbing balls
and falling over each other.

While they are lying tangled up in the grass, MR. BEEBEE
stands above them with the letter.

MR, BEEBEE
If the Miss Alans were to witness
this, they might have second

thoughts again. .
FREDDY

Who are the Miss Alans?
MR. BEEBEE

Sir Harry's new tenants for his

villa.
FREDDY

That wasn't the name.

They all fall on the grass. FREDDY's head is now in
LucY's lap.

LUCY
Wasn't whose name?

FREDDY
Sir Harry's new tenants. I met
him this morning and he said,

68

FREDDY (contd)
"Ahem! Honeychurch, ahem! I
have at last procured really
dee-sire-rebel tenants." I
said, "Hooray, old boy!" and
slapped him on the back.

Lucy
Exactly. The Miss Alans.

FREDDY
Rather not. More like Anderson.

MRS. HONEYCHURCH
Oh good gracious, I knew there'd
be another muddle! I'm always
right. Lucy, I'm quite uneasy
at being always right.

LUCY
It's only another muddle of Freddy's
who doesn't even know the name of
the other people.

FREDDY
Yes I do. I've got it. Emerson.

LUCY
(quietly) What a weathercock Sir
Harry is. I wish I'd never bothered
over it at all.

Then she turns and lies on her back and looks up at the
cloudless sky.

MR. BEEBEE notices LUCY's change of mood.

She hears the voices of the others as from a long way

away:

MRS. HONEYCHURCH
Emerson?...I trust they are the
right sort of person. Yes, Freddy,
there is a right sort and a wrong
sort, and it's affectation to pretend
there isn't.

FREDDY
Well, these must be the "right sort"
because they're friends of Cecil's.

LucY
(sitting up on the grass with a
jolt) Cecil!
Appealing

She goes,

69

FREDDY
(with elaborate irony) So, you
and the other county families will
be able to call in perfect safety.

Lucy
Cecil!

MRS. HONEYCHURCH
Lucy, don't screech. It's a new
bad habit you're getting into.

LUCY
(getting up from the grass) ...
Emerson's a common enough name...

MRS. BEEBEE
(trying to help her regain her
composure) Yes, we had some
Emersons at Florence, do you
remember? Oh, .Mrs. Honeychurch,
the oddest people, these Emersons!
The queerest people - for our part
we liked them, didn't we? -

to LUCY who is on her way to the house.

FREDDY
(catching hold of LUCY's ankles)
",..Ss0 really dee-sire-rebel. Ahem!
Honeychurch, I have just telegraphed
to them..."

Lucy
(gravely) Don't be silly, Freddy.
You always overdo it when you play.

slowly and alone, toward the house. She might

still hear MR. BEEBEE'S VOICE telling MRS. HONEYCHURCH
about the Emersons, describing the roomful of violets.

CECIL is leaning out of the smoking-room window. He's
in great spirits.

CECIL
Don't move! Stay right there!
Yes, a Leonardo...Did you know
you were a Leonardo? Smiling at
things beyond our ken...

But LUCY refuses to be a Leonardo and goes on walking
toward him.
70

LUCY
— Cecil, what's this about Sir
Harry's tenants?

CECIL
(very pleased with himself) Yes,

‘ I, even I, have found him tenants
for his "Cissie Villa." Don't be
angry! You'll forgive me when you
hear it all. I've won a great
victory for the Comic Muse! Don't
be angry.

She is now by the window. He takes her hands. Again -
spuriously - they look like traditional lovers in
traditional romantic pose.

1 LUCY
Oh, Cecil - after all that trouble
I took over the Miss Alans. Well
of course I'd rather have nice
friends of yours, so I suppose I
must forgive you.

CECIL
(laughing heartily) Friends of
~ mine! Lucy, the whole joke is to

come! They're absolute strangers
I . whom I happened to meet in the
National Gallery.

LUCY
(nervously) What an odd place to
Meet people.

CECIL
In the Umbrian Room. Absolute
strangers. They were admiring
Luca Signorelli -- of course quite
stupidly. However, we got talking.
They amused me not a little. They
had been to Italy - a father ana
son - the oddest couple -

Horror and consternation are growing in LUCY. She drops
his hands and steps back from him as he proceeds
hilariously.

We see a Silent Flashback contained within a circular
frame at the side of the master scene.
71

FLASHBACK. DAY. NATIONAL GALLERY. LONDON.

CECIL, GEORGE EMERSON, and MR. EMERSON are seated
together on a round velvet seat in one of the Italian
rooms at the National Gallery.

They are having a conversation which we do not hear,
but which CECIL in Voice Over is describing.

CECIL
«..In the course of conversation
they said they wanted a country
cottage, and did I know of one -
a "simple burrow" they could call
their own, where they could smell
the earth -

We see MR, EMERSON beseeching CECIL with his hands joined
as in prayer.

CECIL
- As a matter of fact, I said, I
do. Not exactly a cottage, more
a "villa" with some rather original
architectural features. It is in
Surrey: a place called Summer
Street.

In the Flashback MR. EMERSON shouts: "Summer Street! I
have dreamed of Summer Street!"

CECIL
- I thought, “What a chance of
scoring off Sir Harry!" I took
their address - it was great sport...

We see this. Flashback ends.

LUCY goes into the house abruptly, but not into the
smoking room.

66. DAY. INTERIOR. PASSAGE AND STAIRS.

CECIL has come to the smoking room door and sees LUCY
ascend the stairs.

CECIL
.-eIt will teach that snob, Sir
Harry, a lesson...No, Lucy, the
classes ought to mix. There ought
to be intermarriage - all sorts of
things. I believe in democracy.
72

LUCY
(snapping)
No you don't...You don't know
what the word means.

CECIL is amazed.

LUCY
It isn't fair, Cecil. I've
probably met them before -

CECIL
Perfectly fair if it punishes
a snob -

LUCY
(cutting his attempt to justify
himself short) Cecil, I blame you
~ I blame you very much indeed.
You had no business to undo my
work about the Miss Alans, and
make me look ridiculous. You
call it scoring off Sir Harry,
but do you realize that it's all
at my expense? I consider it
most disloyal of you.

She leaves him.

CECIL
(looking after her with raised
eyebrows) Temper, Lucy. Temper,

please.

But LUCY goes up the stairs - into her bedroom - closes
the door.

TITLE CARD: THE SACRED LAKE

67. DAY. EXTERIOR. "CISSIE" VILLA, NOW THE EMERSON'S.

A beautiful sunny day. MR. BEEBEE, with FREDDY behind
him, unlatches the gate of "Cissie Villa" and goes up to
the open front door. Behind the two men Summer Street
can be seen, and some automobiles passing with people in
dusters, out for a drive on a glorious day.

MR. BEEBEE
Hallo!

GEORGE is carrying a large framed photograph of Rafael's
"School of Athens" up the stairs.
73

GEORGE
~ Hallo!

MR. BEEBEE
I've brought someone to see you.

GEORGE'S VOICE
I'll be down in a minute.

The front hall is blocked by a wardrobe and other
belongings. The sitting room is full of books in boxes
and in piles stacked up.

FREDDY
(whispering) Are these people
great readers?

1 MR. BEEBEE
I fancy they know how to read -
a rare accomplishment. What
have they got? Byron. Exactly.
A Shropshire Lad. Never heard
of it. The Way of All Flesh.
Never heard of it. Hullo! Dear

1 George reads German. Um - um -

Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, and so
NS we go on.

Someone has painted on the wardrobe in an amateur hand
"Mistrust all enterprises that require new clothes."
FREDDY points this out to MR. BEEBEE.

MR. BEEBEE
I like that. I'm certain that's
the old man's doing. What on
earth are those people doing
upstairs? Emerson - we think
we'll come another time.

GEORGE now comes clattering down the stairs. He pushes
them, silently and unceremoniously, into the sitting room.

MR. BEEBEE
Let me introduce Mr. Honeychurch,
a neighbor.

FREDDY
(to GEORGE) How d'ye do? Come
and have a bathe.

GEORGE
~~ (impassive as usual) Oh all right.
68.

74

MR. BEEBEE
(much amused) That's the best
conversational opening I've
ever heard. “How d'ye do?
Come and have a bathe."

MR. EMERSON comes down the stairs.

MR. BEEBEE
Let me introduce Mr. Honeychurch,
whose sister you will remember at
Florence.

MR. EMERSON

How do you do? Very glad to see
you. Very glad to hear that
your sister is going to marry.

I am sure she will be happy. We
know Mr. Vyse, too. He's been
most kind - yes, go and bathe,
George. The change will do you
good. Then come back for tea.
(calling out after them) Bring
back some milk, cakes, honey.

FREDDY
Do you really want this bathe?

GEORGE
Yes - I've said "yes" already.

MR. BEEBEE leads them out of the house. MR. EMERSON
dispenses smiles and waves, shouts "Yours is glorious
country, Honeychurch!"

DAY. EXTERIOR. PINE WOODS.

The two young MEN are silent, but MR. BEEBEE chatters
away.

MR. BEEBEE
When I was a young man I always
meant to write a "History of
Coincidence."

No response.
MR. BEEBEE
Though, as a matter of fact,

coincidences are much rarer
than we suppose...

Nothing from either.
75

MR. BEEBEE
For example, it isn't pure
coincidentality that you're
here now, when one comes to
reflect.

More silent walking. MR. BEEBEE is about to give up when
GEORGE finally speaks.

GEORGE
I have reflected. It's Fate.
Everything is Fate.

MR. BEEBEE
You have not reflected at all,
Emerson. Let me give youa
useful tip: attribute nothing
to Fate. Now I'll cross-examine
you. Where did you first meet
Mr. Vyse who is going to marry
Miss Honeychurch?

GEORGE
National Gallery.

MR, BEEBEE
Looking at Italian art. There
you are, and yet you talk of
coincidence and Fate! You
naturally seek out things
Italian, and so do we and our
friends. This narrows the
field immeasurably.

GEORGE
It's Fate that I am here, but
call it Italy if it makes you

happy.
FREDDY
Here we are.
MR. BEEBEE
(mopping his brow) Oh, good!
69. DAY. EXTERIOR. “THE SACRED LAKE" - A SMALL POND
IN jOODS «

They make their way down a slippery bank of pine needles
to the little pond that lies in a sort of lap of green.
Because of the rains the water has flooded the
surrounding grass, making it look like an emerald path.

They go up to the edge of the pond and look at it a
moment.
76

FREDDY
(starting to strip) I wish it
was bigger.

MR. BEEBEE
It's distinctly successful as
ponds go. No apologies are
necessary for the pond.

GEORGE sits down where the bank is dry and starts to
unlace his boots.

MR. BEEBEE continues his chatter as the others strip.

MR. BEEBEE
What's the name of this aromatic
plant?
No answer.
MR.. BEEBEE

I love willow-herb in seed -
these abrupt changes of vege-
tation: water plants, heather,
bracken, hurts, pines - very
charming.

FREDDY prances in,

FREDDY
Mr. Beebee, aren't you bathing?

GEORGE is stripping without much enthusiasm, revealing a
fine, compact physique.

When he is naked, he stands on the bank of the pool in a
Michelangelesque pose, weight on one foot, hand care-
lessly on hip, chin down.

GEORGE
Is it worth it?

FREDDY
(puffing up and down) Water's
wonderful. Water's simply ripping.
Do hurry up, Emerson. Come along,
Mr. Beebee!

MR. BEEBEE, laughingly disclaiming any intention of
joining them, nevertheless begins to divest himself
of his clerical clothes.

As GEORGE stands hesitating, the bank breaks away and -
much to FREDDY's delight - he is plunged in.
 

77

GEORGE
(reappearing, sputtering at the
sun) Water's not bad.

FREDDY
Water's wonderful. Mr. Beebee,
do!

MR. BEEBEE looks around cautiously, as if expecting
parishioners to appear from behind the bushes.

MR. BEEBEE
I may as well wash too, why not.

The remainder of his clothes are flung off very fast.
There are now three neat little piles of clothes.
MR. BEEBEE approaches the pool, FREDDY pulls him in.

All three rotate in the pool breast-high, like the nymphs
in Goetterdaemmerung. .

FREDDY
It's like swimming in a salad.
Ugh, I've swallowed a frog.

MR. BEEBEE
{laughing at him) Hee-hee,
Freddy's swallowed a pollywog!

FREDDY splashes him. MR. BEEBEE playfully splashes him
back.

After splashing each other, they turn and splash GEORGE -
timidly, as if unsure of his reaction.

After a moment's delay GEORGE's reaction is stupendous.

He smiles, flings himself at them, splashes them, ducks
them, kicks them, muddies them, and drives them out of
the pond.

FREDDY
Race you round it!

They race around the pond in the sunshine. GEORGE takes
a shortcut and goes through the pond. Then MR. BEEBEE
consents to race. They rush into the water to cool off,
then out to play football.

FREDDY snatches up GEORGE's bundle and places it beside
an imaginary goalpost.
78

FREDDY
Atry! A try!

GEORGE
(scattering FREDDY's bundle
with a kick) Soccer rules!

FREDDY
Goal!

GEORGE
Goal!

FREDDY
Pass!

MR. BEEBEE

Take care my watch!
Clothes are flying in all directions.

MR. BEEBEE
(crying in unheeded protest)
Take care my hat! No, that's
enough, Freddy. Dress, now!
No, I say!

The two young MEN are deliriously running around, FREDDY
with a clerical waistcoat under his arm, GEORGE with a
wide-awake hat on his dripping hair.

MR. BEEBEE
That'll do! Hil Steady on! I
see people coming, you fellows!

He is still disregarded. They continue to yell and
scrimmage. :

MR. BEEBEE
Hi! Ladies!

His warning is too late - the LADIES are upon them before
they can hide.

It is MRS. HONEYCHURCH and LUCY, escorted by CECIL.
FREDDY, dropping the waistcoat at their feet, dives for
shelter into some bracken.

MR. BEEBEE dives back into the pond.

GEORGE, after whooping into their faces, disappears
down a path, still clad only in MR. BEEBEE's hat.
 

79

MRS. HONEYCHURCH
Gracious alive! Who ever were
those unfortunate people? Oh,
dears, look away! And poor Mr.
Beebee, too!

CECIL
Come this way, immediately.

LUCY has swiftly placed her parasol between herself and
the immodest sight.

CECIL
(masterfully) This way, Mrs.
Honeychurch, this way.

But that way FREDDY is hidden, and as they approach, his
head and naked shoulders emerge.

FREDDY
Look out! You're treading on
me. .

MRS. HONEYCHURCH
So it's you, dear. Why not have
a comfortable bath at home, with
hot and cold laid on -

FREDDY
Look here, Mother -

MRS. HONEYCHURCH
You're in no position to argue,
Freddy. Come, Lucy.

As they turn to go -

MRS. HONEYCHURCH
Oh look - no, don't look - oh,
poor Mr. Beebee!

For they have caught MR. BEEBEE in the act of crawling
out of the pond. He hastily crawls back again and swims
there unhappily, surrounded by floating garments of an
intimate nature.

GEORGE, now clad in a pair of ill-fitting trousers,
steps boldly in front of them from behind a bush.

FREDDY
Emerson, you beast, you've got my
bags on!
 

70.

80

MRS. HONEYCHURCH
Hush, dears! Be sure you dry
yourselves thoroughly first.
All these colds -

Lucy
(simultaneously) Oh, Mother,
do come away! For goodness
sake, do come!

GEORGE
Hallo!

This is shouted with such bold self-confidence that they
are stopped in their tracks.

GEORGE
Hallo, Miss Honeychurch! Hallo!

MRS. HONEYCHURCH
(urgently whispering) Bow, Lucy;
better bow. Who ever is it? I
shall bow.

She does so.

LUCY - immaculately dressed in white, holding a parasol -
also bows: she is stiff, tight-lipped, vacant-eyed. So
is CECIL.

But GEORGE, hardly dressed at all, barefoot, barechested,
is as utterly at ease as if he owned the wood, the lake,
the sky, and everything else the eye can see. He is
radiant.

TITLE CARD: HOW MISS BARTLETT'S BOILER WAS SO TIRESOME
DAY. INTERIOR. DRAWING ROOM.

FREDDY is tinkling at the piano, playing "Chopsticks"
with two fingers.

CECIL looks pained at the noise he is making.

LUCY hardly hears it, but aware of CECIL's displeasure,
comes out with an occasional "Must you, Freddy" or "Do
stop it."

MRS. HONEYCHURCH, reading a letter, shakes her head over
it and gives an occasional "Poor Charlotte. Oh, poor,
poor Charlotte."

Lucy
(To CECIL) This is the standard
reaction to any letter from our
cousin Charlotte -
 

81

. LUCY AND FREDDY
(in unison) "Poor, poor Charlotte."

MRS. HONEYCHURCH
How unkind you are...But it really
is serious: her boiler is to be
had out and her bath cistern
cleaned, and all kinds of terrible
to-doing...I think it would be
very nice if we asked her to stay
- and give her a nice holiday
while the plumbers at Tunbridge
Wells finish.

CECIL lays his hands over his eyes.

A pause -

LUCY
Mother, no! We're squeezed to
death as it is with Freddy's

MRS. HONEYCHURCH
Minnie can sleep with you.

LUCY
I won't have her.

CECIL
Most decidedly you won't.

LUCY
Freddy, must you.

with only FREDDY playing chopsticks on the

MRS. HONEYCHURCH
(folding away letter) The truth
is, dear, you don't like Charlotte.

Lucy
She gets on my nerves, and the
one time Cecil met her she drove
him quite frantic. So please,
Mother, don't worry us this last
summer, but spoil us by not
asking her to come.

CECIL .
Hear, hear! We vote no Miss
Bartlett.
 

82

MRS. HONEYCHURCH
This isn't very kind of you two.
You have each other and poor
Charlotte has only the water
turned off and plumbers.

CECIL
Again: Poor Charlotte.

FREDDY suddenly launches into a comic song:

FREDDY
"Strike the concertina's
melancholy string!

Blow the spirit-stirring harp
like anything!"

It isn't very comic, but it overrides the dispute. MRS.
HONEYCHURCH enjoys it, and so would LUCY - If it weren't
for CECIL who gets up and ostentatiously strolls out.

FREDDY
"Let the piano's martial blast
Rouse the echoes of the past!"

CECIL can be seen standing aesthetically under a tree
in the garden, looking like one of those Elizabethan
miniatures of a very refined youth enjoying a highly
stylised Nature.

FREDDY
"They played then a sonata - let
me see!

Medulla oblongata - key of G."

LUCY joins CECIL outside - So that when FREDDY looks
round at his audience, only MRS. HONEYCHURCH is left.

FREDDY
What's the matter? Isn't it
good?

MRS. HONEYCHURCH
(abstracted) It's lovely, dear.

FREDDY
"Then they began to sing_
That extremely lovely thing,

"Scherzando!ma non troppo, ppp.

DAY. INTERIOR. MRS. HONEYCHURCH BEDROOM.
MRS. HONEYCHURCH is changing her frock for dinner. She

pulls it over her head and when she emerges her face is
flushed.

MRS. HONEYCHURCH
Lucy, is anything the matter with

Cecil?
(head
Lucy inside
Cecil's all right. Perhaps he's dress)

a little tired.

MRS. HONEYCHURCH
(ominous tone) Because otherwise -
(with gathering displeasure) because
otherwise I cannot account for him.

Silence. She goes on dressing. LUCY looks unhappy.

MRS. HONEYCHURCH
Since Cecil came back from London,
nothing and no one appears to
please him. Whenever I speak he
winces - I see him, Lucy; it's
useless to contradict me. No
doubt I am neither artistic nor
literary nor intellectual but I
cannot help the drawing room
furniture...

LUCY
(much embarrassed) ...Cecil
doesn't mean to be uncivil - he
once explained - it is ugly
things that upset him - he is
not uncivil to people.

MRS. HONEYCHURCH
Is it a thing or a person when
Freddy sings?

Lucy
(faltering) You can't expect a
really musical person to enjoy
comic songs as we do.

MRS. HONEYCHURCH
Why must he sneer and spoil
everyone's pleasure?...Go and
dress, dear.

LUCY
All right, Mother.
72.

73.

84

MRS. HONEYCHURCH
Don't say "All right" and stop.
Go.

LUCY goes out.
DAY. INTERIOR. LANDING AND PASSAGE.

LUCY stops still by the landing window. She is
depressed. FREDDY comes bounding up the stairs.

FREDDY
I say, is anything on Sunday
week?...If not, I want to ask
the Emersons up for tennis.

LUCY
Oh, I wouldn't do that, Freddy
- I really wouldn't -

FREDDY
(clutching her elbows and dancing
up and down the passage with her)
They're topping people - they're
ripping - the Emersons are
spiffing -

LUCY is very irritated with him - so is CECIL coming up
to change - so is the MAID carrying up hot water cans.

MRS. HONEYCHURCH
(appearing in her doorway) What
a noise you're making.

She sees the expression on LUCY's face.

MRS. HONEYCHURCH
Let Lucy go, Freddy.

FREDDY also now looks into LUCY's face - and lets her
go at once. There is a great unspoken understanding
between these three Honeychurches.

MRS. HONEYCHURCH stands aside, inviting LUCY into her
bedroom again.

DAY. INTERIOR. MRS. HONEYCHURCH BEDROOM.

MRS. HONEYCHURCH
Hook me behind, old lady.

LUCY does so.

LUCY
«Need we have Charlotte?
 

85

MRS. HONEYCHURCH
We need not.

LUCY
And now Freddy wants to ask the
Emersons,

MRS. HONEYCHURCH
He needn't.

Lucy
«..And you're not pleased with
Cecil.

MRS. HONEYCHURCH
Kiss me, dear.

LUCY does so.

LUCY
«+.Well of course, if you feel
Charlotte should come...with her
boiler and everything... (half-
heartedly) She's been so kind
to me...

MRS. HONEYCHURCH
Kiss me again.

LUCY does so and then returns to fastening her mother's
hooks or whatever needs doing by this time.

TITLE CARD: HOW LUCY FACED THE EXTERNAL SITUATION

BRAVELY
74. DAY. EXTERIOR. LANDSCAPE PASSING SEEN THROUGH

TRAIN WINDOW.

The country around Summer Street, looking lush and
beautiful.

But it's not even noticed by CHARLOTTE in the second-
class carriage. She is in an agony of suspense. She
looks at her ticket stub, at a timetable in her bag, at
the other PASSENGERS, whom she would like to ask for
advice - and begins to, raising her gloved hand, but
then falters; they aren't the right sort to ask, being
two TRAVELLING MEN and she a lone female...She with-
draws her hand, rummages again with the timetable, etc.,
stands up, opens the window, but just then the train
enters a tunnel and smoke and cinders blow into the
carriage. The TRAVELLING MEN cough. CHARLOTTE can't
get the window shut. One of them gets up to help her.
She can't thank him enough or apologize enough...
 

86
75. DAY. EXTERIOR. WINDY CORNER.

MRS. HONEYCHURCH is descending from the carriage, looking
put out. LUCY comes to meet her -

LUCY
Where's Charlotte?

MRS. HONEYCHURCH
Charlotte no doubt got off at
the wrong station. Trust

Charlotte.
76. DAY. EXTERIOR. RAILWAY STATION.

CHARLOTTE is peering around anxiously and making anxious
enquiries. A PORTER explains to her that this is not the
South-Eastern station at Dorking but the London and
Brighton station -

CHARLOTTE
(very flustered) I thought it was
Dorking...How very vexing...I
suppose I had better take a cab -
and you had better take my -

In her flurried state, she doesn't see where she is

going - And bumps into a man wheeling a bicycle out

of the station - Her apologies give way to astonish-
ment when she discovers this man to be GEORGE.

CHARLOTTE
Mr. Emerson!

He greets her in his own inimitably impassive way.

CHARLOTTE
.-.Were you on the train? I had
no idea -

GEORGE
My father lives here. I come
weekends.

Considering this both sufficient explanation and conver-
sation, he gets on his bicycle and rides off. CHARLOTTE
gets into the cab, pays the PORTER, is driven off.

77. DAY. EXTERIOR. IN_A CARRIAGE.
CHARLOTTE is now deeply disturbed. She is too much
in her thoughts to notice the beautiful scenery through
which she is being driven. What makes it worse for her
is that every time her carriage rounds a corner she sees -

GEORGE on his bicycle.
78.

80.

81.

87
DAY. EXTERIOR. SUMMER STREET.

Unlike Charlotte, GEORGE is enjoying the scenery very
much. He has his hands in his pockets like a trick
cyclist and is whistling happily.

Passing an overhanging branch, he rises in the saddle
to pluck at it.

DAY. EXTERIOR. EMERSON VILLA.

CHARLOTTE POV - MR. EMERSON and GEORGE affectionately
greeting each other.

DAY. EXTERIOR, WINDY CORNER.

LUCY, looking out for CHARLOTTE, comes out to meet her,
As CHARLOTTE descends from the carriage and before
kissing LUCY -

CHARLOTTE
I had no idea...I met him at
the station...My poor Lucia.

They kiss, both shutting their eyes, for different
reasons.

DAY. EXTERIOR. GARDEN.

MRS. HONEYCHURCH, FREDDY, MR. FFLOYD (Freddy's friend),
CECIL, and MINNIE BEEBEE are at tea.

CHARLOTTE comes up to them in a great flurry, breaking
up the party -

CHARLOTTE
(breathlessly) It was the stupidest
blunder and you'll never forgive me.
I've upset everything.

MRS. HONEYCHURCH
We forgive you. Freddy, pay the
cab.

FREDDY goes.

CHARLOTTE
Oh, but I absolutely insist - I
must - I - how do you do, Mr. Vyse.

MRS. HONEYCHURCH
And this is Mr. Ffloyd, Freddy's
friend -
88

CHARLOTTE
How do you do, Mr. Ffloyd. 1
insist on paying for my cab -

MRS. HONEYCHURCH
And Minnie, Mr. Beebee's niece.

CHARLOTTE
How do you do, Minnie. Grant me
that, at any rate, after all my -

FREDDY has returned.

CHARLOTTE
How much was it, Freddy? I
insist - absolutely -

FREDDY
If you'd really rather - five
shillings, and I gave a bob to
the driver.

Another contretemps ~- CHARLOTTE has no change, only a
sovereign, FREDDY and MR. FFLOYD dig out half-crowns.

CHARLOTTE
«--We all have our little foibles,
and mine is the prompt settling of
accounts...But who am I to give
the sovereign to?

FREDDY and MR. FFLOYD offer to toss for the sovereign.

CHARLOTTE
Please - please - I know I'ma
sad spoil-sport, but it would
make me wretched. I should
practically be robbing the one
who lost.

MRS. HONEYCHURCH turns her eyes up to heaven.

CECIL
(amusing himself) Freddy owes me
15 shillings. So it will work
out all right if you give the
pound to me.

CHARLOTTE
(bewildered, but handing it over)
Most kind of you, Mr. Vyse.

MINNIE
(protesting) Why is Mr. Vyse
taking the quid?
82.

83.

89
MR. FFLOYD and FREDDY try to stifle her with cake.

MINNIE
What about Mr. Ffloyd's ten
shillings?

She shrieks as FREDDY pokes her.

LUCY
(getting up with decision) Cecil,
give me that sovereign. No, give
it to me! I'll get Mary to change
it and we'll start from the
beginning.

She starts off across the lawn,

CHARLOTTE
(following her, wailing) Lucy -
Lucy - what a nuisance I am!

As soon as they are out of earshot -

CHARLOTTE
(quite briskly) Have you told him
about him yet?

LUCY
No, I haven't.

She goes into the house, CHARLOTTE following.
DAY. INTERIOR. PASSAGE.

CHARLOTTE goes into the drawing room. LUCY calls down
the basement stairs to the MAID asking for change -
MAID comes up with it.

LUCY lingers over this, not wanting to join CHARLOTTE
till she has sufficiently collected herself and has
made up her mind what to say. When she has done so,
she goes into the drawing room,

DAY. INTERIOR. DRAWING ROOM.

CHARLOTTE is gazing at an Italian picture hung up there
(it is the same one with which we saw GEORGE struggling
on the stair, Rafael's "School of Athens").

LUCY
No, I haven't told Cecil or
anyone. I promised you I
shouldn't. Here is your money
- all shillings, except two
half-crowns. Would you count
it? You can settle your debt
nicely now.
90

CHARLOTTE
(murmuring, looking at Italian
picture) How dreadful - how more
than dreadful if Mr. Vyse should
come to hear of it from some
other source.

LUCY
There is no other source.

CHARLOTTE
He would have told his father.

LUCY
He. would not. He would not
have told anyone.

CHARLOTTE
How do you know?

LUCY
Because I know. Shall we go
out? They'll smash all the
china if we don't.

Through the windows she can see FREDDY and MR. FFLOYD
scalping MINNIE with tea spoons. Minnie's screams can
also be heard.

CHARLOTTE
Dear, one moment ~ we may not
have this chance for a chat
again. Have you spoken to him
yet?

LucY
«+I have seen him.

CHARLOTTE
What happened?

Lucy
(taking up a position too firm
and common-sensical to be con-
vincing) You simply must stop
thinking that he admires me or
any nonsense of that sort. He
doesn't, not one straw.

Linking her arm into CHARLOTTE's, she draws her outside.
As they go -
84.

85.

91

LUCY
Suppose we don't talk about this
silly Italian business any more.
We want you to have a nice restful
visit at Windy Corner with no
worriting.

DAY. EXTERIOR. GARDEN.

LUCY leaves CHARLOTTE and runs to the rescue of MINNIE.
CHARLOTTE follows soberly, her dark-clad figure
expressing foreboding.

DAY. EXTERIOR. ___GARDEN OF WINDY CORNER.

Sunday morning. Another perfect day. The scene begins
with a travelling shot towards a book, which lies on
the gravel path. It has a red cover and from its size
might be a novel.

As the camera is moving towards this book, which lies
open and face down, as if forgotten, we hear female
voices coming from the house, making church-going
preparations:

VOICES
The men say they won't go...

Well, I don't blame them...
Minnie says, need she go?...
Tell her, no nonsense...
Mary! Hook me behind!...

Dearest Lucia, may I trespass
upon you for a pin?...

The camera has moved to a close-up of the book. Its
title is Under a Loggia.

LUCY, wearing a vivid pink dress, comes out of the
drawing room window and looks at the view. She does
not look happy. In fact she is frowning, looking as
if she is holding back tears.

VOICE OF MRS. HONEYCHURCH
Lucy! Lucy! What's that book?

LUCY looks up at her mother standing in an upstairs
window.
92

MRS. HONEYCHURCH
Who's been taking a book out of
the shelf and leaving it to spoil?

LUCY
It's only a library book that
Cecil's been reading.

MRS. HONEYCHURCH
But pick it up, and don't stand
idling there like a flamingo.
Have you a sixpence for Minnie
and a shilling for yourself?

86. DAY. EXTERIOR. FRONT STEPS OF WINDY CORNER.

The LADIES pop out one at a time, all dressed up for
church, MRS. HONEYCHURCH has worked herself into a Sunday
fluster. She counts out money.

MRS, HONEYCHURCH
It's a special collection - I
forget what for - I do beg, no
vulgar clinking in the plate
with halfpennies. See that
Minnie has a nice bright sixpence.
Where is the child? Here comes
the horse - (etc.)

The carriage pulls up and LUCY and MRS. HONEYCHURCH go
towards it.

CHARLOTTE appears, smartly dressed.

CHARLOTTE
Dear Marian, I'm so very sorry -
but I have no small change -
Could you -

MRS. HONEYCHURCH
Yes, easily. Jump in. Gracious
me, how smart you look. What a
lovely frock!

MINNIE runs down the steps and climbs in and the carriage
pulls away with spirit.

CECIL appears at the door and calls out, "Goodbye! Be
good!" The tone is sneering. LUCY bites her lip.

87. DAY. EXTERIOR, TENNIS LAWN - WINDY CORNER.

FREDDY and GEORGE are playing against LUCY and MR. FFLOYD.
93

The game is very active. LUCY, who has changed her dress,
is entirely different from the morning. She is having
fun; she seems free, relaxed, unimpeded, carefree in a
mood we have not seen before.

GEORGE is very determined to win - He makes LUCY run up
and down - she does her best but keeps missing balls.

This delights him no end and, crowing with triumph, he
shouts out the score.

If there is an impediment to the general fun, it is
CECIL, who is odd man out. He makes a nuisance of
himself and tries to draw attention away from the others.
This he does by walking up and down LUCY's side of the
court, reading aloud from the forgotten red book. The
book is so bad he is obliged to read it to the others.
("I say, listen to this, Lucy - three split infinitives,"
etc.)

GEORGE wins the set ~ But he has knocked so many balls
into the bushes that FREDDY and MR. FFLOYD have to dive
in search of them.

CECIL
There's a murder scene, too -
do listen.

LUCY

What fun, Cecil. Read away.
She seats herself near him. GEORGE jumps over the net.
CECIL
(getting ready to read) The
scene is laid in Florence -

GEORGE sits down at LUCY's feet.

CECIL
"Sunset - the sunset of Italy."
GEORGE
(Looking up at LUCY) Do you mind
losing?
Lucy

(merrily) Yes. Of course I do...
I don't see you're such a splendid
player, though. The light was

behind you, and it was in my eyes.

GEORGE
I never said I was.
94

CECIL
(reading louder, not liking any
interruption) "Under,Orcagna's
Loggia - the Loggia de'Lanzi, as
we sometimes call it now - "

LUCY
What's the title?

CECIL
(reading from spine) Under the
Loggia by Eleanor Lavish.

LUCY
(bursting into laughter) Eleanor
Lavish! Oh my goodness! Mr.
Emerson, you remember Miss Lavish?

GEORGE
Of course I do.

LUCY
No wonder the novel's bad. But
I suppose one ought to read it as
one's met her.

His dark head is very near her lap. She stares down at
it. We feel her impulse could be to suddenly stroke it.

CECIL
There's an absurd account of a
view which I will spare you -

LUCY
No, do read it...How do you like
our view, Mr. Emerson?

GEORGE
My father says there's only one
perfect view -

He looks up into her face - She waits, interested.

GEORGE
- the view of the sky straight
over our heads, and that all
these views on earth are bungled
copies of it.

CECIL
(shutting the book with a snap)
I expect your father has been
reading Dante.

He gets up, ready to stalk off.
95

LUCY
--.Cecil, do read the description
of the view.

CECIL
Not while Mr. Emerson is here
to entertain us.

LUCY
No - read away. Nothing's funnier
than to hear silly things read out
loud. If Mr. Emerson thinks we're
frivolous, he can go help look for
tennis balls.

CECIL is pleased with this reply and sits down again,
mollified.

LUCY
Mr. Emerson, go and find tennis
balls.

GEORGE
Must I?

LUCY

No, of course not.

CECIL
(yawning, handing the book to
Lucy) It's in Chapter 2 - just
find me Chapter 2.

LUCY leafs through the book to find the chapter. She
reads something which freezes her. Her eyes are
stretched wide.

CECIL
Here - give it to me.

LUCY
(holding the book away from him)
Oh it's too silly - who would
want to read such rubbish -

CECIL reaches over and takes the book from her and reads:

CECIL
"afar off the towers of Florence,
while the bank on which she sat
was carpeted with violets. All
unobserved, he stole up behind
her" - Isn't it immortal? - "there
came from his lips no wordy
protestations such as formal
lovers use..."
He looks up from the book to have her share his

96

smile -

Afraid of what he might see in her eyes, she turns them

from him -

And looks straight into GEORGE's, unblinkingly raised

to hers -

CECIL

"No eloquence was his, nor did
he suffer from the lack of it.
He simply enfolded her in his
manly arms - " This isn't the
passage ~ there's another much
funnier further on - (searching
for it)

LUCY
(in a steady voice) Should we
go in to tea?
She rises and leads the way.
CECIL
By all means, tea rather than
Eleanor Lavish.

He follows her.

GEORGE follows them both. They enter the shrubbery.

CECIL

Oh, I forgot the book -
LUCY

Never mind -
CECIL

It's your mother's library book
and she will fuss.

He goes back to get it.
GEORGE blunders against her in the narrow path.

LUCY
No -

But he kisses her (on the lips).

And she stands still for him.

CECIL'S VOICE can be heard approaching - "I must read
you the bit about the murder - a crime passionel - "

LUCY walks on.
88.

89.

97
CECIL rejoins them,
GEORGE lets them walk ahead.

CECIL
(his voice receding) What is
it about Italy that makes lady
novelists reach such summits
of absurdity...

GEORGE, trailing behind, plucks a flower rather roughly,
but he holds and smells it tenderly.

TITLE CARD: LYING TO GEORGE
DAY. INTERIOR. PASSAGE AND STAIRS.

As CECIL and LUCY enter the house - CHARLOTTE is coming
down the stairs.

LUCY
Charlotte ~ .

CHARLOTTE sees that something has happened.

Lucy
(to CECIL) Go and start tea.
I'll be with you in a moment.

She watches CECIL go into the drawing room and help
himself from the tea table. Then she goes into the
Opposite room.

DAY. INTERIOR. SMOKING ROOM.

CHARLOTTE immediately follows, looking apprehensive. As
soon as the door is shut -

LUCY
Do you know anything about Miss
Lavish's novel?

CHARLOTTE looks bewildered and then a little shifty.

Lucy
There is a scene in it. The
hero and heroine make love. Do
you know about that?

CHARLOTTE
Dear - ?

LUCY
Do you know about it, please.
They are on a hillside, and
Florence is in the distance.
 

98
CHARLOTTE opens and then closes her mouth.

LUCY
There are violets. I cannot
believe it is a coincidence.
Charlotte, Charlotte, how could
you have told her?

CHARLOTTE
Oh, Lucy, dearest girl - she
hasn't put that in her book?

LUCY nods. CHARLOTTE sinks on to a chair.

CHARLOTTE
Then never - never - never more
shall Eleanor Lavish be friend
of mine.

LUCY
So you did tell?

CHARLOTTE hides her face, shaking her head, making no
attempt to defend herself.

LUCY
Cecil read it to me - and - that
man took the opportunity to
insult me again behind Cecil's
back,

CHARLOTTE moans.

LUCY
Why did you tell her? What
Made you?

But now LUCY sees GEORGE approaching, ambling slowly
toward the house across the lawn.

As she watches him - CHARLOTTE moaning - the hard
expression goes from LUCY's face and she looks like

a girl watching her lover from the window. And GEORGE

- handsome and manly - does look like a lover. But then
her expression hardens again.

Lucy
I see now why you wanted me to
tell Cecil, and what you meant
by "some other source." You
knew that you had told Miss
Lavish, and that she was not
reliable.

CHARLOTTE, wincing, joins LUCY by the window and takes
her hand,
99

CHARLOTTE
Even if you forgive me, I shall
never forgive myself, not to my
dying day.

LUCY
(watching GEORGE, not listening
to CHARLOTTE) Go and call him.

CHARLOTTE
Call Mr. Vyse?

Lucy
No - no. The other one.

CHARLOTTE tries to protest but LUCY, turning from the
window, says in a cold voice:

Lucy
This time I'11 deal with him
myself,

CHARLOTTE dare not disobey her. She goes out. LUCY
seats herself very straight-backed in a very straight
chair.

She clenches her hands: she can be seen steeling her-
self, CHARLOTTE returns with GEORGE, still holding his
tennis racket.

LUCY
Charlotte, please stay.

CHARLOTTE, looking frightened, shuts the door and stands
against it as if barring their exit. We see them from
CHARLOTTE POV.

LUCY
(rising from her seat) Mr.
Emerson, go out of this house
and never come into it again as
long as I live here...I hate a
row. (pointing to the door)
Go, please.

GEORGE
But I can't -

LUCY
Go, please. I do not want to
call in Mr. Vyse.

GEORGE
You don't mean you are going to
marry that man?
100

Lucy
(taken by surprise, then
recovering; she hasn't expected
him to take that line) You are
merely ridiculous.

While they continue talking, CHARLOTTE can see CECIL
appearing on the terrace with his tea cup:

CECIL carefully puts down the cup, seats himself, dusts
his knees, picks up his cup, stirs it, sips it, precise
and prissy looking.

GEORGE
»«eOh, I would have held back
if your Cecil had been a different
person. But he's the sort who
can't know anyone intimately -
least of all a woman. He doesn't
know what a woman is. He wants
you for a possession - he wants
to see you as a painting - or an
ivory box - something exquisite
to own and display. He doesn't
want you to be real and think and
live.

CHARLOTTE turns away from the sight of CECIL - CHARLOTTE
POV - LUCY and GEORGE standing close together.
Dissolve -

DAY. EXTERIOR. TUSCAN LANDSCAPE.

CHARLOTTE sees again - LUCY and GEORGE kissing among
the violets - but enhanced, more than what took place:
more romantic, more passionate. Dissolve -

DAY. INTERIOR. SMOKING ROOM.

LUCY and GEORGE standing close together. GEORGE is, as
usual, unable to express himself and stammers with strong
feeling; afraid of not making himself clear, he tends to
repeat the same idea several times over, in his own
simple, straightforward language.

GEORGE
But I love you - in a better way
than he does. Yes - really ina
better way: I want you to have
your own thoughts even when I hold
you in my arms.

And for a moment it looks as if he is going to take her
in his arms - But this time he controls himself and turns

instead to CHARLOTTE:
101

GEORGE
You wouldn't stop us this second
time, if you understood.

And in fact CHARLOTTE does not stop them - she lowers
her eyes away from GEORGE's penetrating gaze and says
nothing. So that he feels entitled to appeal again
directly to LUCY:

GEORGE
It's our last chance.

He gazes at her with great intensity. Like CHARLOTTE,
she cannot meet thisgaze, half turns from him; there is
something hesitant in her attitude which makes him press
on:

GEORGE
You mustn't say no - you mustn't
ever say no to what's right and...
good. Don't you understand how
lucky people are when they've
found what's right for them?
It's a...blessing, don't you see?

She has remained in her hesitant attitude but now she
faces him - faces him falsely, with a hard laugh that
isn't hers at all:

Lucy
And the fact that I love Cecil
and shall be his wife shortly?
I suppose that's a detail of no
importance.

And he does brush it aside as though it were:

GEORGE
This tremendous thing has
happened and what it means - let
me explain ~- it means nothing
must hinder us, not ever again.
Never again. That's what it means.
You have to understand that.

Lucy
I have no idea what you're talking
about.

GEORGE

(half turning to CHARLOTTE, with
great emphasis, almost shouting)
Everyone has to understand!
 

102

CHARLOTTE starts forward as though to say something, but
LUCY silences her with a gesture.

LUCY
And you must leave. It was
wrong of me - very wrong - to
stand here listening to you.

She turns away from him in dismissal, and as she does
so, he catches her hand in desperation - and she doesn't
snatch it away at once but leaves it lingering in his
long enough for him to say -

GEORGE
But you haven't been listening.
If you had, you would know.

Now she does snatch it away.

LUCY
How dare you. You will leave
at once. Now. -No, not another
word ~ no no -

And, much shaken in spite of herself, she puts her hands
over her ears -

Lucy
I will not listen to one more
word.

CHARLOTTE
Lucy -

Lucy

(flashing out at CHARLOTTE)
Haven't you done enough? Don't
interfere again.

GEORGE tries to meet LUCY's eyes again - but she is
resolutely turned away from him. He stands there for
a moment, defeated, then goes toward the door where
CHARLOTTE is still standing. CHARLOTTE doesn't move,
making no secret of the fact that she doesn't want
him to leave.

GEORGE
It's useless. Let me go, Miss
Bartlett.

Still CHARLOTTE does not move.

LUCY
Let Mr. Emerson go, Charlotte.
92.

103
CHARLOTTE moves aside reluctantly.

It is CHARLOTTE who goes to the window to watch GEORGE
stride away.

LUCY, to hide her feelings, has busied herself with
some tidying around the room.

. CHARLOTTE
I shall never forgive myself.
(but never forgive herself for
what?)

LUCY
You always say that, Charlotte,
but you always do forgive your-
self, quite readily.

She goes out briskly.

CHARLOTTE watches GEORGE go up the drive and begin to
climb the slope behind the house.

It is CHARLOTTE now who has tears in her eyes.
DUSK. EXTERIOR. GARDEN,

LUCY, still walking briskly, passes CECIL who is again
reading Miss Lavish's book on the terrace. He wants to
read her another comic passage but she walks past him,

LUCY goes through the garden to the place in the
shrubbery where GEORGE kissed her. But now everything
is different - the brightness has died out of the air,
afternoon is drawing into evening, and the lengthening
shadows are creeping over the house.

Only FREDDY and MR. FFLOYD are still calling out in
jolly voices as they bounce balls around on the court -
One ball comes bouncing into the shrubbery where LUCY
catches it.

FREDDY comes to retrieve it.

FREDDY
Hallo, Lucy! There's still light
enough for another set, if you
two'll hurry.

LUCY
Mr. Emerson has had to go.

FREDDY
What a nuisance.
93.

104
He calls to CECIL sitting on the terrace:

FREDDY
I say, Cecil, do play, there's a
good chap. Just this once -
it's Ffloyd's last day.

CECIL
My dear Freddy, as you well
remarked this morning: "There's
are some chaps who are no good
for anything but books." I
plead guilty to being such a
chap.

FREDDY bangs the ball across the net in disappointment.
Pleased with his repartee, pleased with himself, CECIL
continues to amuse himself over his book.

We see him from the POV of LUCY:

He adjusts his pincenez, he smiles, he swings one
elegant foot.

We see the scales fall from LUCY's eyes, as it were. She
turns away from him decisively, turns her back on him

as if to shut him out and the life they'd planned
together.

TITLE CARD: LYING TO CECIL

NIGHT. INTERIOR. SMOKING ROOM.

All through this scene where LUCY breaks off her engage-
ment, she is shown to be irritated and sometimes angry
with CECIL - irritated and angered by herself, of course,
as much as with him - while he is always shown as gentle,
rational, calm - if bewildered by what she's saying. It
is his finest hour in the film; he gets to redeem himself
somewhat. Forster wrote of CECIL here: "...For all his
culture, Cecil was an ascetic at heart, and nothing in
his love became him like the leaving of it..."

CU CECIL, taking off his pincenez, looking bewildered.

CECIL
(incredulously) ...Because I
wouldn't play tennis with Freddy?

LUCY is on her knees by the sideboard, putting away some
whiskey bottles. She doesn't turn to him as he speaks.

CECIL
«eI never do play tennis. I
never could.
105

LUCY
Oh, forget the tennis. It was
just the last straw. I'm sorry,
Cecil. I can't marry you and
you will thank me for saying so
one day, We are too different.

She speaks irritably and all her fussing around the side-
board is irritable.

But CECIL is stammering with true feeling.

CECIL
But I loved you, and I did
think you loved me!

LUCY
(rising) I did not. I thought
I did at first. I'm sorry...
And as for your loving me - no
you don't, Cecil, not really.

She pauses. He stands looking at her, speechless for
once, Then an inspiration strikes her:

Lucy
You don't. It's only as some-
thing else - as something you
can own - a painting; a Leonardo.
I don't want to be a Leonardo.
I want to be myself. Oh, don't
let's go on now. I shall only
say things that will make me
unhappy afterwards.

CECIL
You don't love me, evidently.
I dare say you're right not to.
But it would hurt a little less
if I knew why -

LUCY
Because - you're the sort who
can't know anyone intimately,
least of all a woman.

A horrified look comes into his eyes.
LUCY
I don't mean exactly that, but
you will go on asking questions -

He doesn't defend himself. Instead he looks at her as
she struggles to express herself.
106

LUCY
You wrap yourself up in art and
books and music, and you want to
wrap me up! That's why I'm
breaking off my engagement.

There is a pause. Then CECIL says with emotion:

CECIL
It's true.
Lucy
(feeling ashamed) True on the

whole...

Another pause. CECIL speaks gently, with growing
admiration. Now that he's losing her, each moment
she seems more desirable.

CECIL
+--You're so different tonight.
Like a different person - speaking
with a new voice.

Lucy
(her irritation bursting into
uncontrollable anger) If you
think I'm in love with someone
else, you're very much mistaken!

CECIL
O£ course I don't -

LUCY
(cutting across his protestation)
If a girl breaks off her engage-
ment, everyone always thinks "Oh,
she has someone else - she hopes
to get someone else." It's
disgusting, brutal!

CECIL
No, Lucy, no. I beg your pardon.
You must excuse me if I say stupid
things, but my brain has gone to
pieces.

After a silence, ashamed of her outburst, impressed by
his dignity:

LUCY
I really think we'd better go to
bed, if you don't mind.
107

CECIL
~~ .---Let me light your candle,
shall I.

He does so, carefully and gently, and gives it to her.
His voice is breaking as he speaks again.

CECIL
I must actually thank you for what
you've done - for your courage in
doing it. I do admire you for it.
Will you shake hands?

LUCY
Of course I will, Cecil.

They solemnly shake hands and then go out into the hall.

LUCY
Goodnight, Cecil. I'm sorry
about it. Thank you very much
for taking it so well.

94. NIGHT. INTERIOR. PASSAGE AND STAIRS.

NS CECIL watches LUCY go upstairs, the shadows from the
banisters passing over her face like the beat of wings.

95. NIGHT. EXTERIOR. GARDEN.

CECIL looks at Windy Corner as if he were saying goodbye.
He wanders about. He sees a figure glimmering in the dark
on the bench where he once proposed to LUCY. He
approaches -

CECIL
(surprised) Miss Bartlett?

He sits next to her.

CECIL
Aren't you going to bed?

CHARLOTTE
No, I like sitting here. I come
here quite often, after everyone's
asleep...Perhaps that surprises
you.

CECIL supports his head between his hands.

CECIL
Lucy has broken off our engagement.
108
CHARLOTTE says nothing.

CECIL
«+-If there were a.reason - it
might be easier; even if there
were someone else -

CHARLOTTE
I hope you don't think that?

CECIL
Of course I don't. Of course
not, she didn't have to accuse
me of that.

A silence.

CECIL
Perhaps she is right, and I
can't love her as she should
be...loved; that I can't be
with anyone that way.

CHARLOTTE is looking up at the house which is quite dark
except for Lucy's window. LUCY's shadow can be seen
moving against it.

A silence. Perhaps they get up and walk about before he
starts up again.

CECIL
Perhaps I'm one of those who's
meant to live alone. Some of
us are...I think perhaps you are
too, Miss Bartlett.

CHARLOTTE
(after a pause) I dare say it
seems so now, but it wasn't always.
Not at all always. Certainly not
when I was Lucy's age...Look,
she's blown out her candle.

For the light in Lucy's window is extinguished, and
everything is dark.

TITLE CARD: LYING TO MR. BEEBEE, MRS. HONEYCHURCH, FREDDY
AND THE SERVANTS

96. DAY. INTERIOR. BLOOMSBURY HOTEL BEDROOM-SITTING
ROOM

MISS CATHERINE ALAN is writing a letter to MR. BEEBEE,
sitting at a little writing table in a Spartan room. We
109

hear the words of the letter aloud. As she is writing
she gets up to put a sixpence in the gas fire and it
makes a clink in the gloom. Traffic sounds of the city
come in from outside.

MISS ALAN (VO)
",..Since Florence did my sister
so much good, we do not see why
we should not try Athens this
winter.

She goes to put the coin in and returns.

MISS ALAN (VO)
«Of course, Athens is a plunge,
and the doctor has ordered her
special digestive bread; but,
after all, we can take that with
us, and it is only getting first
into a steamer and then into a

train..."
97. DAY. EXTERIOR, ROAD OVER THE HILL TO WINDY

CORNER.

MR. BEEBEE is bicycling along through a blustery after-
noon. The sky is dark with clouds, the wind blows,
trees groan, and the first autumn leaves fly away.

He is smiling to himself. We hear MISS ALAN's letter.

MISS ALAN (VO)
“,...Dear Mr. Beebee, is there an
English Church? I do not expect
we shall go any further than
Athens, but if you know of a
really comfortable pension at
Constantinople, we would be so
grateful..."

He sees CECIL and FREDDY coming towards him up the road
on foot. Some way behind the carriage, with a trunk and
other luggage in it, is making its way up slowly. They
meet and shake hands.

MR. BEEBEE
So you're off for a minute,
Mr. Vyse?

CECIL
Yes.

FREDDY looks shifty-eyed and uncomfortable.
110

MR, BEEBEE
I was coming to show Miss Honey-
church this delightful letter
from those friends of hers, the
Miss Alans.

He quotes from it.

MR. BEEBEE
Isn't it wonderful? Isn't it
Romance?

CECIL

(civilly) I'm sure Lucy will
be amused,

FREDDY
Have you any matches? I'm sorry
to interrupt.

CECIL
(in a more kindly tone than
usual) I have.

He hands him his silver match box.

MR. BEEBEE
You've never met these Miss Alans,
have you, Mr. Vyse?

CECIL
Never.

MR. BEEBEE
Then you don't see the wonder of
their Greek visit. I haven't
been to Greece myself, and don't
mean to go. It's altogether too
big for our little lot. Don't
you think so? - All right, Freddy,
I'm not going to be clever - give
me those matches when you're done
with them, I was saying, if our
poor little Cockney lives must
have a background, let it be
Italian...

He lights a cigarette. Durinc the above the carriage
makes it to the top and the two young MEN climb in.

CECIL
You're quite right. Greece is
not for our little lot. Goodbye.
98.

111

The carriage moves off, but stops after a dozen yards.
FREDDY comes running back to ask for CECIL's match box.

FREDDY
Cecil's hard hit. Lucy won't
marry him.

MR. BEEBEE
But when -
FREDDY
Late last night. I must go.
MR. BEEBEE
Perhaps they won't want me down
there.
FREDDY

No - go on. Goodbye.

He runs after the carriage and MR, BEEBEE gets on his
bicycle, smiling with satisfaction at the good news,
slapping the saddle of the bike approvingly.

DAY. EXTERIOR. GARDEN OF WINDY CORNER.

The wind has knocked down the dahlias. MRS. HONEYCHURCH,
looking cross, is tying them up. CHARLOTTE, inappro-
priately dressed for the task, offers unwanted assistance.
MINNIE and the gardener's CHILD each hold the end of a
long piece of twine.

MRS, HONEYCHURCH
Not the scissors, thank you,
Charlotte, when both my hands
are full already. How do you
do, Mr. Beebee? Gracious, what
a mess everything is!

MINNIE goes up to her uncle and whispers to him.

MINNIE
Everyone is so horrid today, Uncle
Arthur - let's go out to tea.

MR. BEEBEE
Get your hat and coat, Minnie, and
I'll take you. I shall take her up
to tea at the Beehive Tavern. Would
you like to join us, Miss Bartlett?

MRS, HONEYCHURCH
Yes, Charlotte, I don't want you
- do go.
99.

112

CHARLOTTE
Thank you, but you have no one
to help you. Even my poor
services are better than nothing.

MINNIE looks pleased that CHARLOTTE isn't going to tea.

MRS. HONEYCHURCH
Oh look out!

For CHARLOTTE, in lunging at a falling plant, has stepped
on it. MRS. HONEYCHURCH looks ready to explode.

From inside, LUCY can be heard playing Mozart.

MR. BEEBEE
It's terrible, this havoc among
the flowers...Ah, Mozart today -
less exciting than Beethoven,
perhaps, but also less unsettling...

He walks toward the drawing room with his letter.
DAY. INTERIOR. DRAWING ROOM.

When MR. BEEBEE comes in, LUCY is still tinkering at
Mozart but stops quite soon.

MR. BEEBEE
(talking fast) Here is this
most delightful letter from the
Miss Alans who are making plans
for a thrilling trip to Greece -
I must read you this - (reading)
"...I do not think we shall go
any further than Athens, but if
you know of a really comfortable
pension at Constantinople..."
Constantinople! Isn't it
delightful! They will end by
going round the world.

Lucy
(echoing in a dull voice)
Delightful!

He puts down the letter.
A pause.
MR. BEEBEE

(after clearing his throat) Miss
Honeychurch, your brother told me.
113
LUCY
(with a trace of annoyance) Oh
did he?
MR. BEEBEE

I needn't say that it will go
no further.

Lucy
(striking a note on the piano
for each name) Mother - Charlotte
- Cecil - Freddy - you. (and
then striking a sixth note)

MR. BEEBEE
If you'll let me say so, I'm
certain you have done the right
thing.

LUCY
(in a high, artificial voice)
Oh, do tell me more about the
Miss Alans! How perfectly
splendid of them to go abroad!

MR. BEEBEE
I want them to start from Venice
and go in a cargo steamer down
the Illyrian coast!

LUCY looks suddenly alert.

Lucy
Oh, I long to join them!...Did
Freddy say whether he was driving
straight back?

MR. BEEBEE
No, he didn't.
Lucy
Because I hope he won't go

gossiping.

He puts the letter away, expecting her to go on about
her broken engagement. But she says instead:

Lucy
How perfectly splendid of them
to go abroad. I wish they'd
take me.

He sees to his surprise that she is serious.
100,

101.

 

114

MR. BEEBEE
Would your mother spare you again
so soon? You've scarcely been
back three months.

LUCY
She must spare me. I simply
must go away. I have to.

She runs her hands hysterically through her hair.

LUCY
Don't you see that I have to
go away?
CHARLOTTE comes in.
Lucy

..-Charlotte, isn't it too romantic!
The Miss Alans are going to
Constantinople!

MR. BEEBEE
So far only to Athens -

Lucy
I have always longed to go to
Constantinople. Athens, I mean.

MINNIE BEEBEE comes in to claim MR. BEEBEE.

MR, BEEBEE
In lieu of Constantinople, could
Minnie and I not lure you to tea
at the Beehive?

LUCY thanks him but declines. So does CHARLOTTE. MR.
BEEBEE and MINNIE go out.

DAY. EXTERIOR. WINDY CORNER IN ITS SETTING.

Hand in hand, MR. BEEBEE and MINNIE are walking sedately
up the hill.

DAY. INTERIOR. DRAWING ROOM.

LUCY
(with great intensity) You must
help me persuade Mother. (when
CHARLOTTE, completely bewildered,
starts protesting) ...Don't you see
that I must go somewhere - any~-
where (striking her knees with
clenched fists) I must get away,

(MORE)
115

LUCY (contd)
ever so far...Before it's known
(impatiently, as CHARLOTTE looks
puzzled) that I've broken off my
engagement...He must not get any
ideas.

CHARLOTTE
You mean, Mr. Emerson might think
it was on his account?

LUCY
How slow you are, Charlotte.
How slow.

CHARLOTTE

Of course there must be no gossip
in Summer Street. But to go all
the way to Greece -

LUCY
(interrupting) ~ You saw him your-
self that day, you heard him. If
he gets to know of this, goodness
knows what will happen.

There is a pause. They look at each other.

CHARLOTTE
(hesitating) Lucy, are you
completely sure -

LUCY
{unhesitating) Yes! What are
you thinking of -

CHARLOTTE
(swallowing) - completely sure that
you want to go to Greece?

Lucy
Well - of course - of course -
of course.

But she doesn't look at CHARLOTTE. She turns away and
goes on -

LUCY
- I would have thought you would
want to help me - that you would
be the first to go to Mother and
say "Lucy must go to Greece at
once" - that you would want to do
this for me -
102.

116

CHARLOTTE
Of course I want to do every-
thing that is right for you, can
you doubt that for one moment?
Everything that is good for you.

FREDDY comes in.

LUCY
I'm telling you what is right
and good for me - oh please
don't argue - do what I ask.

CHARLOTTE presses LUCY's hand and goes out.

LUCY sits at the piano again.

FREDDY
Why's she look like that?
LUCY
Like what?
FREDDY
(shrugging) Like Charlotte
Bartlett.
. LUCY

(starting to play again) Because
she is Charlotte Bartlett.

FREDDY sits on the floor, leaning against LUCY while she
plays and sings.

DUSK.

EXTERIOR. BEEHIVE TAVERN.

MINNIE
(her mouth full of cream bun)
One thing I've noticed, Uncle
Arthur: you're the one person
who never gets cross. It must
be because you're the vicar.

MR. BEEBEE
It could be that. Or because
I tend to be disengaged.

MINNIE
Is that what's happened? Has
Lucy got disengaged?

MR. BEEBEE
Attend to what I'm saying: dis-
engaged in the sense of not being
an active participant: of being
merely a spectator.
103.

117

MINNIE
Because if she's got disengaged
from Mr. Vyse, then it's not so
bad.

MR. BEEBEE
Yes, but not with your mouth
full, please, Minnie.

DUSK. INTERIOR, DRAWING ROOM.

104.

Lucy is playing and singing. FREDDY is still sitting on
the floor, leaning against her.

LUCY
(singing)
"Stop thine ear against the singer
From the red gold keep thy finger."

PREDDY
The tune's right enough, but the
words are rotten. Why throw up
the sponge?

LUCY
How stupidly you talk.

FREDDY
«--Tell you what I could do: run
up to London and see Cecil. If
you like, I could.

LUCY
Sit quiet and listen. (singing)
"Vacant heart, and hand, and eye,
Easy live and quiet die."

DUSK. EXTERIOR. GARDEN.

MRS, HONEYCHURCH is still struggling with her dahlias -
getting more and more cross every minute, with them and
with the Garden BOY.

At this inauspicious moment, CHARLOTTE, her skirt blowing
in the wind, comes to make her announcement. What she
says and what MRS. HONEYCHURCH replies is lost in the
windstorm, so the scene is a kind of pantomime of

gesticulating, more seen than heard.

MRS. HONEYCHURCH
Look at my scarlet pompoms, isn't
it a tragedy?

CHARLOTTE
Lucy hase a plan -
105.

106.

118

MRS. HONEYCHURCH
(not hearing because of the wind)
And I'm perfectly certain that the
orange cactus will go before I can
get to it.

CHARLOTTE
(shouting) Miss Alans are going
abroad! They're going to Greece!

MRS. HONEYCHURCH
Good luck to them.

CHARLOTTE
(bravely shouting) Lucy would
like to join them as far as Athens!

MRS. HONEYCHURCH sits down there and then in the flower
bed and stares up into CHARLOTTE's face.

CHARLOTTE
(less bravely) _...And on to
Delphi if the roads are safe.
At that moment the orange cactus falls.
DUSK. EXTERIOR. WINDY CORNER IN_ITS SETTING,

MR. BEEBEE and MINNIE are descending the hill toward
Windy Corner.

LUCY'S VOICE can be heard singing:

"Stop thine ear against the singer
From the red gold keep thy finger."

As they draw near the house, they can see LUCY through
the glass doors.

FREDDY has his head against her as she sits at the
piano, and an unlit pipe between his teeth.

LUCY
(singing) .
"Vacant heart, and hand, and eye,
Easy live and quiet die."

The song sounds even more mournful than the autumn gale:
but not so the piano accompaniment, which appears to be
soaring on wings of its own.

DAY. INTERIOR. THE EMERSON HOUSE.

As in the earlier scene, when we saw them move in, there
 

119

was a cheerful air of. unpacking, now there is a depressed
air of packing up, giving up, departing.

GEORGE could be struggling on the stairs with the big
picture by Raphael, carrying it down as we saw him take

it up before. He might then turn to packing books into
OXeS «

MR. EMERSON
Take all those but leave me Thoreau
till I leave. I need him by me now.

GEORGE drags a filled box away to stack with other boxes.
As he does so, speaking in a dull matter-of-fact tone:

GEORGE
It's an ugly house. We never did
like the house.

MR. EMERSON
What's a house? It's what you
put in it - the light you fill
it with, that's what makes a
house. (looking out at the rain)
Why is rain even worse in the
country?

POV MR. EMERSON: water dripping from the trees like
tears, soaking into the grass, falling onto water,
falling on the tombstones in the churchyard (whatever one
sees from his window - in any case, it should look like
the world is dissolving in tears).

MR. EMERSON
(turning from the window) And
when we first came, the sun was
shining all the time. Yes, every
day was bright.

GEORGE
(painfully straightening up from
carrying a heavy load) You can't
expect the summer to last forever.

He is very gloomy; he looks like a hero in defeat. His
FATHER comes over to him and puts his hand on GEORGE's
shoulder. This hand trembles. Obviously he would like
to do more - embrace his SON, comfort him - but there is
something granite about GEORGE that does not encourage
the soft gestures of comfort.

Watched by MR. EMERSON, GEORGE stoically continues to
pack.
107.

120

GEORGE
I mustn't miss the train. The
movers can do the rest - no, not
you. I don't want you straining
your back. I won't be coming
next weekend. There's no point.
I'll come to take you back to
town the week after.

MR. EMERSON accompanies GEORGE to the door and stands
there watching while GEORGE gets on his cycle.

DAY. EXTERIOR. COUNTRY ROADS.

108.

GEORGE cycling to the station - but very differently
from the way we saw him travel the same road in an
earlier scene. Then it was all downhill and he rode as
a conquering hero; now he is pedalling painfully uphill,
hunched against the wind and the rain.

DAY. INTERIOR. BLOOMSBURY HOTEL LOUNGE.

LONDON.

The MISS ALANS are entertaining LUCY and MRS. HONEYCHURCH
to tea. There are other elderly LADIES sitting around
doing the same. LUCY and MRS. HONEYCHURCH are the
liveliest looking elements in the scene, which is other-
wise hushed, genteel, and in terms of any life or gaiety,
virtually moribund.

CATHERINE ALAN
«ePaper soap is a great help
towards freshening up one's face
on a train...But of course, you
know all about these things, and
you have Mr. Vyse to help you.

MRS. HONEYCHURCH begins to drum nervously on her card
case.

CATHERINE ALAN
We think it so good of Mr. Vyse
to spare you. But perhaps he will
come out and join you later.

TERESA ALAN
(the more acute, and less kindly,
of the two sisters) Or does his
work keep him in London?

CATHERINE ALAN
We shall meet him when he sees
you off. I do so long to...
109.

110.

121

MRS. HONEYCHURCH
(cutting her off) No one will
see Lucy off. She doesn't like
te

TERESA ALAN
Really? How funny! I should
have thought that in this case -

MRS. HONEYCHURCH rises decisively.

CATHERINE ALAN
Oh, Mrs. Honeychurch, you aren't
going? It's such a pleasure to
have met you...

MISS TERESA and MISS CATHERINE chatter away as they see
their visitors off - "We shall write to you very often
and send pretty cards from every place. We know how
anxious you will be to hear, naturally, of course, both
you and Mr. Vyse."

DAY. EXTERIOR. BLOOMSBURY STREET. LONDON.
LUCY and MRS. HONEYCHURCH walk through the drizzle.

LUCY
(with relief) We just got through
that time.

MRS. HONEYCHURCH
Yes, and were seen through, which
is most unpleasant.

DAY. INTERIOR. BLOOMSBURY HOTEL LOUNGE.

The two OLD LADIES return to their table.

MISS CATHERINE
(peering into the teapot) Is
there a drop left? Oh, quite a
bit left. They were in such a
hurry, they hardly had time to
enjoy their tea... (she pours
it, also examines the sandwiches)
Do you think these are curling
just the tiniest bit? (but she
takes one and eats it) ...Do you
know, Teresa, I could not help
thinking that our dear Lucy did
not look -
ill.

122

MISS TERESA
I wish you would learn to finish
your sentences, Catherine, you
are getting worse and worse.

MISS CATHERINE
(indicating she cannot speak
because of having her mouth full,
but when that difficulty is
overcome, she continues) - no,
did not look like a bride-to-be.

MISS TERESA
Oh? And pray, how should a
bride-to-be look according to
your great wisdom and experience
in these matters?

MISS CATHERINE
I can't say exactly how, only
that she lacked something. Yes
- well - if you must know,
Teresa ~- radiance. (and in
pronouncing it, she loads that
word and glows with it)

MISS TERESA
(after regarding her speculatively)
Do you know what I think? I think
you need cooling off. Perhaps we
should be going to a colder climate
- to Russia not to Greece.

MISS CATHERINE
(playfully shuddering) Brrrrr.

MISS TERESA is hard put to it to continue to look severe.
DAY. EXTERIOR. LONDON STREET.

Still in drizzle, and continuing their earlier conver-
sation, MRS. HONEYCHURCH sounds very annoyed, and so
does LUCY.

MRS. HONEYCHURCH '
I shall never understand this
hole and corner work. You've got
rid of Cecil - well and good, and
I'm thankful - but why not announce
it?

LUCY
I promised not to till I left
England. It's only for a few days.
112.

123

MRS. HONEYCHURCH
But why at all?

They have reached a bookstore near the British Museum
and turn in.

DAY. INTERIOR. LONDON BOOKSHOP.

They go over to the guidebook section - as LUCY stretches
up for the Baedeker for Greece:

MRS. HONEYCHURCH
I still don't understand it.
Why? Why Greece? Why go rushing
off to the ends of the earth?

LUCY pretends to be engrossed in Baedeker.

MRS. HONEYCHURCH
I'm beginning to think that you're
tired of your home - of Windy
Corner -

LUCY
(irritable and petulant) 0h,
Mother, what rubbish you talk!

MRS. HONEYCHURCH
- and tired of Freddy and me.

A silence, during which LUCY takes down another book.

LUCY
Of course I'm not tired of Windy
Corner.

MRS. HONEYCHURCH
Then why not say so at once instead
of considering for half an hour
first.

LUCY
(leafing through book) ...0f
course I want to live at home.
But as we're talking about it,
I may as well say that in the
future I shall want to come up
to London more. I might even
share a flat for a little with
some other girl. You see, I come
into my money next year.

Tears come into MRS. HONEYCHURCH's eyes.
124

Seeing her MOTHER's look, LUCY screws up her mouth and
~~ backtracks.

LUCY
Perhaps I spoke hastily.

MRS, HONEYCHURCH
(flashing out) Oh, goodness!
How you do remind me of Charlotte
Bartlett.

Lucy
Charlotte?

MRS. HONEYCHURCH
Charlotte to the T,.

She purses up her mouth the way LUCY did just now and
the way CHARLOTTE does often. LUCY turns her face away,
as one offended.

MRS, HONEYCHURCH
There: Charlotte again.

LUCY
(through clenched teeth, and
Ne leaving her mother to go up to

the cashier) I don't know what
you mean, Charlotte and I are
not in the least alike.

MRS. HONEYCHURCH
(following LUCY) No, you used
not to be.

MRS. HONEYCHURCH stands looking at her daughter counting
out change. She does resemble CHARLOTTE: pinched,
anxious, and prematurely spinsterish.

MRS. HONEYCHURCH relents as she watches LUCY, anxiety
and concern softening her expression.

113. DAY. INTERIOR, RAILWAY CARRIAGE.

The train rushes through a sodden landscape. Neither
LUCY nor MRS. HONEYCHURCH speak. The train whistles
forlornly and the rain-streaked glass rattles and shakes.

LUCY makes a show of reading the Baedeker guide she's
just bought.

She stops at a photograph of the Charioteer of Delphi,
struck by the statue's grave, youthful, masculine
confidence.

DAY. EXTERIOR. EMERSON VILLA.

CHARLOTTE, passing, sees Emerson furniture being carried
out. She walks over to MR. BEEBEE's house.

DAY. INTERIOR. MR. BEEBEE'S HOUSE - PASSAGE.

CHARLOTTE
Oh, Mr. Beebee, what is happening
to your neighbours?

MR. BEEBEE
Alas, they are moving out. Old
Mr. Emerson's rheumatism has come
on, and George says it is too far
out of town -

Through the open library door, CHARLOTTE sees MR. EMERSON
sitting by the fire.

CHARLOTTE
Might I trespass on your kindness,
Mr. Beebee, and wait here for Mrs.
Honeychurch to fetch me in the
carriage?

MR. BEEBEE
Most certainly, with pleasure -
do join Mr. Emerson who has taken
refuge in there from the movers.
Only you must excuse me - (the
organ can be heard from the church)
- as you can hear, they have got
going there -

He goes out. She goes into the library.
DAY. INTERIOR. MR. BEEBEE'S LIBRARY.

MR. EMERSON is sitting by the fire. He looks wan and
weak but smiles at CHARLOTTE with a childlike sweetness.

CHARLOTTE
I'm very sorry to hear, Mr.
Emerson, that the house has
brought on your rheumatism.

MR. EMERSON
It's not the rheumatism; it's my
boy...George is so sorry! I
cannot blame him - and yet I
wish he had told me first.

CHARLOTTE
(a pause) ...He never told you
- not what happened in Italy?

MR. EMERSON
Not one word.

CHARLOTTE
(almost to herself) Yes, that's
what Lucy thought...

MR. EMERSON
I was only told last Sunday -

CHARLOTTE
What were you told?

MR. EMERSON
That he loves her.

flinches, blushes, turns away.

MR. EMERSON
(regarding her keenly) Won't
you sit down?

CHARLOTTE
I think I hear the carriage -
it would be most discourteous
to keep my cousin waiting.

MR. EMERSON
No, there isn't any carriage.
Sit down, my dear.

hesitates, then sits - or rather, perches,

uncomfortably.

CHARLOTTE
(biting her lip, rigidly) There
appears to have been a series of
unfortunate misunderstandings.

MR. EMERSON
Worse than that, Miss Bartlett.
Everyone's been lying, except
George. And now here's Miss
Honeychurch marrying Mr. Vyse
in January - (he trails off as
CHARLOTTE shakes her head)

CHARLOTTE
Miss Honeychurch - Lucy - is
taking a tour of Greece with
(MORE)
127

CHARLOTTE (contd)
our friends, the Misses Alan,
you may remember them from the
Pension Bertolini, Miss Teresa
and her younger sister, Miss
Catherine - (or however far she
gets before he has taken it in
and interrupts her)

MR. EMERSON
(almost shouting) She is not
getting married?

CHARLOTTE
Miss Honeychurch has broken off
her engagement. It was all done
with great tact and discretion,
naturally, and for the time being
we would prefer it to be kept
quiet -

MR, EMERSON
(interrupting again) Oh, there's
a time for keeping quiet, Miss
Bartlett, and there's a time for
speaking out. No, you don't hear
any carriage - but why don't you
sit back - lean back - make your-
self more comfortable - here, take
this - (he puts a cushion behind
her) - there, that's better.

You look much better.

And CHARLOTTE, now with a cushion at her back, does look
better: more relaxed, less rigid.

DUSK. EXTERIOR. LANE IN SURREY.

117.

LUCY and MRS. HONEYCHURCH are seated in the Honeychurch
carriage. POWELL is driving them. The rain has stopped.

Showers of water fall from the overhanging trees and
rattle on the hood of the carriage. The carriage-lamp
passes its searchlight over mud and fallen leaves.

They are coming in to Summer Street. It is oppressive
inside the carriage.

LUCY
Can't we have the hood down?

MRS. HONEYCHURCH
(with sudden tenderness) Very well,
old lady. Stop the horse.
118.

128

The horse stops. LUCY and POWELL wrestle with the hood
and get it down. When it is down, LUCY sees: Cissie

Villa, exactly opposite, with the movers carrying out
furniture.

LUCY
Is that house to let again,
Powell?

POWELL
Yes, miss.

LUCY

Have they gone?

POWELL
Sir Harry's looking for new
tenants, I heard.

LUCY sinks back. The cottage recedes into the distance.
The horse's hooves strike the road.

LUCY is in a kind of despair and sits numbly, thinking
about her recent actions.

MRS. HONEYCHURCH
What a pity about the Emersons.
Freddy will be so sorry and indeed,
so am I...Lucy, go and get
Charlotte from Mr. Beebee's, and
do hurry both of you because Mary
has her fishpie in...Such an
agreeable family. What a pity.

LUCY gets down from the carriage.
She goes up to MR. BEEBEE's house and rings the bell.
TITLE CARD: LYING TO MR. EMERSON

DUSK. INTERIOR. MR. BEEBEE'S LIBRARY.

LUCY, opening the door, sees MR. EMERSON and CHARLOTTE
sitting as before by the fire. Before she can say
anything:

CHARLOTTE
Lucy, Mr. Emerson says it is all
his fault.

MR. EMERSON

Because I told him to trust to
love. I told him, "George, love
and do what you will." It's what
I taught him, and so you see it is
all my fault.
119.

129

CHARLOTTE uses this speech to make her get-away - that
is, during it she gets up and tries to slip out of the
door.

LUCY
Where are you going?

CHARLOTTE
Your dear mother has most thought-
fully come to fetch me in her
carriage, and I have not been
brought up to keep anyone waiting,
least of all a kind hostess.

When LUCY tries to go out with her, she pushes her back
into the room and shuts the door on her.

DUSK. EXTERIOR. CARRIAGE.

120.

MRS. HONEYCHURCH is very irritated.
When she sees CHARLOTTE emerging -

MRS. HONEYCHURCH
Now where is Lucy? No, you get
in, Charlotte. If Mary's fish-pie
is spoiled, she will mope from now
till next Friday -

CHARLOTTE gets in, seating herself humbly with her back
to the horse.

When MRS. HONEYCHURCH protests -
CHARLOTTE
This will do very well for me -
I must not inconvenience you -
When MRS. HONEYCHURCH insists -
CHARLOTTE
I shall make myself as tiny as
a mouse.
And she does so, to MRS. HONEYCHURCH's exasperation.
DUSK. INTERIOR. MR. BEEBEE'S LIBRARY.

MR. EMERSON and LUCY. All through this scene we hear
the sound of the litany.

LUCY
«.»eMr. Emerson, I have no wish to
discuss your son or even to hear
(MORE)
A pause.

130

LUCY (contd)
his name mentioned. He has mis-
behaved from the first... (facing
MR. EMERSON) Why, he has behaved
abominably. Do you know what he
did?

MR. EMERSON
(gently) Not “abominably." He
only tried when he should not have
tried.

Lucy
No, of course. "Abominable" is
much too strong a word. I'm
sorry I used it about your son.
I must leave you - Mother and
Charlotte are waiting -

MR, EMERSON
And now he's gone under.

MR. EMERSON
(striking his palms together in
silence, his head falling on
his chest) Gone under.

Another pause. She looks frightened.

Lucy
(in a shaky voice) ...Is your
son i11?

MR. EMERSON

No, George is never ill but he
«eegoes under. Gives up and -
(makes a sinking gesture) It
was the same in Florence, after
you left. Horrible. Then we
take the house here and he goes
bathing with your brother, and
became better. You saw him
bathing?

LUCY
I'm sorry, but it's no good
discussing this affair...

MR. EMERSON
George is coming to take me up
to London. He can't bear to be
here, and I must be where he is.
(MORE)
 

131

MR. EMERSON (contd)
He says the thought of seeing
you and of hearing about you -

LUCY
(in a kindly tone of voice for
the first time) Oh, Mr. Emerson,
don't leave - at least not on my
account. I'm going to Greece.
Don't leave your comfortable house.
You mustn't! I've been bother
enough to everybody by now -

MR. EMERSON
Why are you going to Greece?
(when LUCY has no answer) My
dear, I'm worried about you. It
seems to me - (he says this
dreamily, posing a hypothesis
almost to himself) - that you
are in a muddle. It seems to
me - (continuing his hypothesis)
- that the reason you are going
to Greece - the reason you have
broken your engagement - (yes,
Miss Bartlett told me) - is
that you love George.

Lucy
(gasping) Oh! Oh, how like a
man! - I mean, to suppose that a
woman is always thinking about a
man.

MR. EMERSON
But you are.

She sinks down on a chair, completely bewildered, all her
thoughts and feelings turned upside down.

MR. EMERSON
You see, my dear, you can ignore
love, you can muddle it, you can
do whatever you like - but you can
never pull it out of you...Look,
all the light's gone out of your
pretty face - just like it's gone
out of George...I cannot bear it...
And now I've made you cry. Dear
girl, forgive me.

Lucy
(in a panic) But I have to go to
Greece now - the ticket's bought
and everything - it's impossible!
121.

132

MR. EMERSON
There's only one thing impossible,
and that's to love and to part.

VOICE of MRS. HONEYCHURCH calling for LUCY.

LUCY gets up, glad of an excuse to run away.

But MR. EMERSON gets up too -

MR. EMERSON
(pressing home on her) You love
George! You love the boy body
and soul as he loves you!

LUCY
(as she lowers her veil, tears
pouring down her face) But of
course I do, What did you all
think.

She hurries out, with him close behind her, MRS. HONEY-
CHURCH's voice calling.

Lucy
Oh please not, Mr. Emerson -
Mother's calling - I must go -
they trust me -

MR. EMERSON
But why should they, when you have
deceived everyone, including your-
self?

MRS. HONEYCHURCH is still calling but LUCY does not call

back.

DUSK.

She has stopped still, waiting for MR. EMERSON to
say more.

EXTERIOR, CARRIAGE.

MRS. HONEYCHURCH
«..If Lucy has so much to say to
Mr. Beebee, then let her walk home,
Go on, Powell.

The carriage starts, with MRS. HONEYCHURCH grumbling to
CHARLOTTE.

MRS. HONEYCHURCH
On no account am I going to have
Mary moping. I don't know what
has got into Lucy: she was never
so inconsiderate. But now one
week Italy, next week Greece -
133

CHARLOTTE
The plan for Greece may be
cancelled.

MRS. HONEYCHURCH
What? Now? When everything is
turned topsy-turvy -

CHARLOTTE is constantly craning back out of the carriage -
She sees LUCY running behind them -

CHARLOTTE
(in great excitement) Oh stop!
Lucy has something to tell us!
Do stop!

She gets up in the carriage - she looks drunk with her
hat and veil slipped over her eyes - she is in danger of
falling out so that MRS. HONEYCHURCH has to hold her by
clasping her around the knees.

122. NIGHT. INTERIOR. ‘CHARLOTTE'S BEDROOM IN
TUNBRIDGE WELLS.

CHARLOTTE, now entirely back in character, is putting
herself to bed.

Encased in flannel night-gown and cotton night-cap, she
slips her hand under the neatly turned-down blankets to
make sure of her hot water bottle.

She gets into bed. From her bedside table she takes an
envelope with foreign stamps and draws out a letter
which appears to have been already read more than once -

LUCY (VO)
Dear Cousin Charlotte, You will be
glad to hear that the Pension
Bertolini is entirely its own dear
self. Even the guests appear to
be just another set of Miss Alans
- Miss Lavish - Mr. Beebee - and
indeed Charlotte and Lucy -

123. DAY. INTERIOR. PENSION DINING ROOM.
It is exactly as beforeand - yes, the GUESTS do seem to
be yet another set of English spinsters and clergymen:
except for LUCY and GEORGE who are sitting there.

The bottles of wine and water still alternate down the
table -

The GUESTS are still cutting meat with English boarding
house refinement -
124.

134

Two NEWCOMERS enter: a young GIRL and her CHAPERON.
They are received with the stiff good breeding appropriate
to newcomers who have not yet proved themselves.

Their seats are opposite LUCY and GEORGE. They whisper
to each other - the CHAPERON trying to dampen the ardour
of the GIRL.

But finally the GIRL breaks out, turning to GEORGE and
LUCY:

GIRL
But we were promised rooms with
a view -

CHAPERON

Hush, dear, we mustn't -

GIRL
It's so unfair! (appealing to
GEORGE and LUCY) Don't you agree
that on one's first visit to Italy
one must have a room with a view?

GEORGE
We have a room with a view. (but
he doesn't offer to give it up)

NIGHT. INTERIOR. CHARLOTTE'S BEDROOM.

125.

CHARLOTTE puts away the letter. She blows out her candle.
She sleeps. She dreams.

NIGHT, INTERIOR. ROOM WITH A VIEW IN CHARLOTTE'S

126.

DREAM.

GEORGE and LUCY are standing by the open window, kissing
- Dissolve -

NIGHT. INTERIOR. ROOM WITH A VIEW.

GEORGE and LUCY really are kissing by the open window,
standing against the same view she saw on her first night:
the lights dancing in the Arno, the cypresses of San
Miniato, and the foothills of the Appenines, black against
the rising moon.

There is a hiss like a serpent's from underneath the
window.

GEORGE and LUCY draw apart and look out:

A COACHMAN is eagerly offering them his carriage for
tomorrow:
 

135

COACHMAN
Signorino, domano faremo un
giro -

Lucy

(leaning forward) Lascia, prego,
lascia. Siamo sposati.

COACHMAN
Scusi tanto, signora.

He whips up his horse and drives off singing. GEORGE
shuts the window shutters. And they continue to kiss
with increasing ardour: breaking not only out of

Charlotte's dream but - passion mounting - out of the

19th century and - with passion unconfined - into the
20th.
