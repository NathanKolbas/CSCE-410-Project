TURNER reaches the unl ocked gate, pushes it open.

INT. ALHS HOUSE - RECEPTION AREA

A red light flashes and a warning buzzer sounds. Aside from
that, the first floor of this place | ooks just like what that
pl aque says it is.

MRS. RUSSELL is at her cluttered desk. She has short grey

civilian clothes, is bent over _an open drawer | oading film

rear. Plants fill the room on desk, along wndowsills,
radi ators and hanging fromplanters. And there's that odd
ULTRA VI QLET LI GHT that encourages pl ant - growth.

TURNER

DR LAPPE -- standing on a chair, watering one of the hanging
pl ants wth a | ong-snouted watering-can -- just checks his
pocket-watch, says nothing. Turner ignores the inference,
