FADE IN:
INT. APARTMENT BEDROOM - NIGHT - RAIN

HOLD IN DARKNESS. Rain against glass. We are in a cold plush
condo. Headlines and diplomas line the wall. A tv dribbles
sports scores... A PHONE RINGS... A groan as a man in a suit
is awoken. An arm lashes out, hitting a SPEAKERPHONE --

SPEAKERPHONE
«--Gary? You awake?

MAN
Am I awake... Uh. Yes, Greg...

SPEAKERPHONE
...There’s gonna be a midnight
hearing in the Rivers Case. Defense
found a notebook mis-filed in
evidence. A diary. ...argued to the
State supremes it was supressed.

The MAN bolts up, hits a LIGHT and snatches the receiver --
Give him a shave, he could be president -- We'll call him -

THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY
What the hell are you talking about?!

INT. COURTHOUSE LOBBY -- NIGHT -~ RAIN -- CONTINUOUS

| ‘The MAN ON THE SPEAKERPHONE paces 8 déserted marble” lobby:

Out an archway, we can see the rain pouring down. Holding a
cel and a briefcase, he’s a young lawyer who we’1ll call --

ASSISTANT D.A.
They punted it to Judge Taylor an
hour ago, Gary. ‘Told him if he
wanted the execution to go forward,
he'd have to hold an evidenciary
tonight. *

WE INTERCUT BETWEEN THE MEN ~- INT. CONDO & INT. COURTHOUSE --

DISTRICT ATTORNEY (ON PHONE)
This is not happening.

The Assistant D.A. watches as a car screeches into a spot
outside. A DETECTIVE (VAROLE) jumps out, clutching folders --

ASSISTANT D.A.
No one‘s here yet. No media --
It happened under the radar. ...The
prisoner transport left Ely an hour
ago.

He slams down another shot of something dark and syrupy...
LARRY (CONT'D) (cont’d) *
Alright, let's go for a spin...
Without warning, the doors burst open and a man crashes in
carrying a woman in his arms -- There's BLOOD EVERYWHERE -
The man is GEORGE YORK, loving husband and father of one - '
And the woman his wife, ALICE -- bleeding to death -
GEORGE
a She won't stop bleeding.

Jesus. What happened?
George goes to answer, but the PICTURE FREEZES FRAME -
SMASH TO:
| 3 OMMITTED
/ 4 INT. MINIVAN (MOVING) -- SAME TIME :
Wipers click to and fro, swishing in the rain.
It's George and Alice again, an hour earlier. They're a sweet
couple -- somehow the President of the Science Club managed
to marry the Captain of the Cheer Squad... The radio reports

an oncoming storm, flood alerts, etc. and chimes six o’clock.

TIMOTHY, their ten-year-old boy, lies in the back amid a pile
of toys and books. He plays with a speaking math toy.

TOY VOICE

ALICE
Timothy, honey -~ can you not do
that right now? We're trying to
hear about the storm.
(to her husband)
Sure you don't want me to drive,
George?

GEORGE
Let’s stick to the plan. I'll get
us to Anderson. You take over after
we get something to eat. 76 miles.
That’s an hour and twenty two
minutes at this speed.

CLOSE ON -- the speedometer -~ EXACTLY 55 mph -- George
concentrates on the road once more... a man who needs precise
order to survive... Alice returns to her magazine - Suddenly -
- A LOUD EXPLOSION --

GEORGE (CONT’D) (cont’d) *
Oh boy!

The minivan veers across the road -- Alice yells out --
But George isn't panicking -- He's mumbling to himself -

GEORGE (CONT'D) (cont'd) *
Turn into the spin. Apply the brake
with short firm pumps. Check

mirrors.
George corrects the tail spin and brings the vehicle safely
onto the soft shoulder -- He's even remembered to indicate.

CUT TO: *
EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY -- MOMENTS LATER ~- TWILIGHT
George reaches under the wheel arch and pulls out ‘something
that was lodged in the molten remains of the radial -- It
looks like ZEBRA HOOF with a SIX INCH SPIKE nailed to it.

ALICE
What is that?

GEORGE

EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY -- TWILIGHT -- FIVE MINUTES AGO

An aging TRANS AM roars past. An ‘after market' convertible,
meaning someone took the roof off with a chain saw -~

It's being driven by PARIS NEVADA, Vegas call girl ~- Late
twenties... She fumbles out a cigarette and starts looking
for a lighter -- Purse, nothing -- Glove box -- nothing --

As she remembers -- The PICTURE FREEZES FRAME -
SMASH TO:
INT. VEGAS SUITE -- DAY -- ONE HOUR EARLIER...
DIM LIGHTING -- IN CLOSE UP -- Paris flicks her lighter and
lights a line of BIRTHDAY CAKE CANDLES -- PULL BACK TO REVEAL
that the candles are in fact stuck on a FAT NAKED BUSINESSMAN
who is tied to the bed, covered in whipped cream...
PARIS
(singing)

For he’s a jolly good fellooow...

Which nobody can deny...
She tosses the LIGHTER in her suitcase -

SMASH BACK TO:
EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY -- TWILIGHT
Paris sees the bulging suitcase on the back seat -

PARIS
Damn.

Without slowing down, she reaches for the bag and starts for
the lock -~ There's a ripping sound as the bag is torn open
by the gale.and clothes ‘start flying everywhere -

PARIS (CONT'D) (cont‘d) *
Jesus shit!

She finds the lighter, lights her cigarette, but it fizzles
out. She looks upward as -- RAIN BEGINS TO COME DOWN ON HER
FROM THE DARK SKY ABOVE.

PARIS (CONT'D) (cont’d) *
God dammit...

She tosses the butt and flicks on her wipers and the radio,
holding a Burpee Catalog over her head.

jm 3/11/02 6.

We hear the same broadcast heard in George’s car.
The hour chimes - six o’clock.

As her Trans Am roars off, clothes are distributed by the
gusting wind... AND A SINGLE OBJECT lands on the wet road,
tumbling over and over until it comes to rest... A SHOE. To
be precise, a 'zebra skin' stiletto with six inch ‘hooker
heels'...

SMASH BACK TO:

OMITTED
EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY -- LATER -~ NIGHT

Night has fallen and the rain’s gotten harder. George bolts a
pathetic “mini tire” onto the van, a flashlight propped on
the ground. Alice stands over him, holding an umbrella
looking skeptical.

ALICE
Why didn’t we get a better spare?

GEORGE
Do you know what radials cost,
Alice?

ALICE
Don’t be defensive.

GEORGE
If the point is to save up so we
can put him -- put Timmy -- into
the right school -

ALICE
(sighs)
You want a juice?

GEORGE
No, thank you.

A banging on the window and Alice looks up to see --

Timothy smiling at her... his hand pressed to side glass.
She presses her hand to the window over his and smiles.

He takes his away. And smiles.
-- She takes hers away.

He shuffles on his knees backward from the window.
-- Alice takes a step back from the window. smiles.

SUDDENLY -- HELL EXPLODES --
 

jm 3/11/02 7.

(>) ALICE IS HIT BY A BLACK CAR --
She's hurtled through the air --

Timothy’s eyes are contorted with terror --
His mouth opens -- but no sound comes out --

George is sent tumbling -- and Alice lands beneath a road
sign, her neck slashed open --

And the car, a limousine, screeches to a standstill --

George rolls over onto his front to see his wife's crumpled
body. He runs to her, still holding the jack handle -- The
only sound is Timothy's strange voice-less crying -- and
distant thunder... :

GEORGE (CONT'D) (cont'd)
Alice! Oh, my God --

He turns back to the limousine -- It's motionless and quiet.
George runs to it and starts pounding on the dark windows --

GEORGE (CONT'D) (cont’d)
What have you done?! WHAT HAVE YOU
DONE?!

Wipers swing to and fro... The radio chimes 6:30...

A woman rides alone in the back -- CAROLINE SUZANNE -- A semi-
famous 70’s-movie actress. She dials a number on her cell
phone and waits... And waits...

CAROLINE
Come on, Harry. Pick up. Pick up
the phone...

CAROLINE

ED, the driver, pulls at his tie and glances back in the rear
view, not really interested. There’s a darkness in his eyes,
but a quiet calm about him. He will not let her get to him.

| CAROLINE (ON PHONE) (CONT'D) (cont’d)
Harry, we need to talk. I walked
off the set. I’m in my car and
going home. I know they're going to
call you and tell you I’m in breech
but clearly they didn’t read my
deal. They had me in a room with no
tub and sealed windows at a Ramada
on the same floor as the fucking
A.D.! I’m on my cell -- I’m gonna
try you on your --

(her phone BEEPS and dies)
---Shit. God dammit! Hey. I think I
have a spare battery up there.
Hello? I'm talking to you! Driver!

 

ED
Excuse me?

CAROLINE
I think I put a spare battery in
the. side pocket of my Vuitton.
Beside you.

Ed glances at the Louis Vuitton ensemble stuffed into the
seat well beside him.

ED
Any idea which...

CAROLINE
In the duffle! Just look! It’s

them, you assume responsibility.

It is my responsibility. -- Let go.

| Ed exits, slamming the door on Caroline --

14 EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY -- SAME TIME

Ed hurries to George, who stands over his wife -- He's
panicking -- Unable to find reason or order in the accident -

GEORGE

‘eS Ed kneels over Alice as George stands and starts to recite
from Highway Code -

GEORGE
"...The driver of every motor
vehicle who is in any manner
involved in an accident originating
from the operation of a vehicle...
(continues )

Ed examines the gash in Alice's neck. He rolls his coat and
puts it under her head. He pulls a kerchief from his pocket,
glances at George beside him reciting traffic code -- then
notices Timothy, standing in the rain, staring, terified.

. ED : :
«..Uh. You got a t-shirt in the van? *
Timothy stares at him, frightened. Ed crosses to their van
and grabs a towel. He wraps it around Alice’s neck and grabs
Timothy, carrying him to the van -- He puts Timothy inside
and turns to --

GEORGE
.»+-Shall, within ten days after the
e accident, report the accident...

ED
What's your name?

GEORGE
George. George York. That's my boy,
Timothy. -- WHY DIDN'T YOU SEE US?!

ED
George. We need an ambulance. Right
now. ...Do you have a phone?

: . GEORGE
. No, no. ...You can’t have those
things around children.
..-microwaves.

Ed blinks, baffled by this man. He takes the jack handle from
George and instructs him --

ED
Go over there -- keep her dry.

Ed crosses to his limo ande reaches for the door but --

THE LOCKS SNAP DOWN. He pulls on the door handle and glares
at his own reflection in the tinted window.

THE JACK HANDLE ~- He reaches in and takes the phone from
Caroline --
CAROLINE
Jesus! ALRIGHT! The phone's dead,

Ed tosses down the useless phone, and looks at the road
ahead... Rain coming down harder... Lightning in the distance.

GEORGE .
She won't stop bleeding.

LARRY

emergency. Thirty miles east.

Ed puts Timothy down and crosses toward the door.

ED
You stay here. Get her in bed and
keep pressure on the wound.
(exiting into the rain)
I'1l come back with an ambulance.

George, still grasping for sanity, turns to Larry -
GEORGE
We'll need non-smoking. She hates
cigarettes.
Larry glances at the injured woman.

Close on -- a small copy machine, scanning. Larry nimbly
flips back the cover and grabs the driver’s license of --

Caroline Suzanne, who stands uncomfortably in his office with
her bags. Larry notices her photo on the I.D. as he hands it
back. He looks up at her, squinting.

LARRY
Hey ...Didn't you used to be that

Caroline shoots a fierce look. Tries to squeeze out a smile.

CAROLINE

Larry grabs a key from the board. Caroline slips a fifty on

then in the distance she spots -- Headlights approaching --
PARIS LEAPS OUT INTO THE DOWNPOUR, BLASTING HER HORN,

Standing in the flow, Ed splashes, angrily kicking a tire.

ED
Goddamit! Shit.

Paris sits shotgun, purusing a thumbworn copy of SARTRE.
She looks at him through an open window.

PARIS
I told you...

Before Ed can respond, he's blinded by the lights of another
car --~- coming up behind them toward the flooded road --
Quickly, he sloshes forward to stop them -

ED
Stop! You can’t get through!
There’s no way through!

We meet GINNY, behind the wheel -- early twenties, college
cool. In the passenger seat -- Half-asleep, probably hung-
over -- LOU -- same age, grunge -- wearing dark glasses --

GINNY
Lou. Wake up.

Lou
What's going on?

Look. There’s been an accident and

Listen to me, dude, I am having a
very fucked up, very wet, very bad

Alright! Okay! We don't have one.

Ed pulls himself back out, looks to Ginny.

ED
Then I need you to give us a lift
in the other direction.

GINNY .
It's flooded that way too.
..-Worse than this.

Paris appears behind Ed. She is soaked. And sexy.

LOU
Only thing between there and here
is a shit bag motel. *

ED
That’s where I came from.

I guess it’s where we’re going.

Ginny eyes Paris supiciously --
Lou's eyes drift to the tee shirt that clings to her.

LOU
Unlock the doors. Let’em in.

lock onto Paris -~ and hers onto him. She doesn’t like him.

LARRY
«-eyeah -- ...Where’s your Lincoln?

Stuck in the run-off 2 miles from

One catches her eye. It features pictures of native american
relics and paintings of a bloody battle. The headine reads --
“THE SHOSHONE TOMBS”. She looks up to see --

Lou watching -~ Paris, as she leans over Larry’s desk,
checking things out. Lou feels Ginny’s stares and turns away.

Larry steps to the other side of the counter and crosses to
his money box, which he closes. He looks Paris in the eye.

LARRY
We don’t rent rooms by the hour.

PARIS :
Funny. You still serving food?

LARRY
Vending machines are round the
corner. The rooms are warm, dry and
thirty bucks in advance with a copy
of your license. Any takers?

Paris slaps down her license and some cash.

PARIS
Excuse me. I was talking to you. I’d

Slow down.

motel pool and out a gate, staring at the phone meter.

A WIDER ANGLE shows Caroline getting further and further from
the lights and safety of the motel as she dials...

Now, once again, we are under the curtain with Caroline. Her

phone beeps. She stops. Turns. And it beeps again. She dials

quickly and waits for her call to connect...

Now we're outside of the motel, looking at Caroline alone in

the rain... And the CAMERA MOVES CLOSER -- Oh shit, it's some

Back under the curtain, Caroline's getting impatient...

The two men jump aside --
They have no hope of stopping the truck...

Inside, Larry speeds past them to freedom --

And that's when little Timothy walks out of the motel -- He’s
followed his stepdad into the path of the speeding truck.

No NO!

But there's nothing he can do --
But George leaps toward his boy as --

Inside the truck -- Larry reacts violently -- STAMPING on the

even studded tires find little traction in the mud -

Little Timothy stares into he oncoming lights. Frozen.

buried behind the grill -- blood seeps onto the sidewalk...

Ginny comes out -- And everyone is motionless -- There's no

EXT. GOLDEN PALM MOTEL -- NIGHT

The ROAR of an engine as it's fired up -- And Paris backs up
Larry’s truck -- Ed guiding it off the corpse. She shuts off
the motor and the three (Rhodes, Ed, Paris) gather around
George's body...

Larry watches through the office door, still tied to his
chair. Ginny stands under the eves. Timothy sleeps on the
couch through the door behind her.

Ed finds George’s hands and pries them apart - nothing.

Rhodes kneels beside Ed and gently peels back the blood
soaked jacket, searching through George’s pockets...

Rhodes pulls out a KEY from George's pants...

RHODES
Seven.

Ed and Rhodes exchange glances.

Standing under the eves, rain falling all around her, Paris
looks about, pale, speechless. Tears stand in her eyes.

PARIS
---This is... ...really ...very
fucked. up. ...I mean, I saw what
happened. ...I was right there. I
saw him run out. No one could've
known he was gonna do that. No
one...

GINNY
No one human.

RHODES
So is that where we are now?! Is
it?! It’s the Shoshone spirits
getting their revenge?!

(stomping into the diner)

~- Hey. Maybe it’s the the ghost of
the guy Larry shoved in a baggie!

Rhodes clatters about in the diner, looking for a bottle of
booze with something left inside.

Rhodes runs to Larry. But Ed doesn’t move. He is numb.
He looks to Paris, her face lit by the spitting fire...

PARIS

Larry and Rhodes return with two red canisters. Helped by the
rain they get the fire under control, but the extinguishers
run out of juice. The rains sizzles as it falls on the hot
metal and remaining flames. Smoke billows in the rain.

They stare at the skeleton of the car.

RHODES
Where the hell are they?

There is no trace of the bodies in the car.

LARRY
-.-Maybe it got so hot, they were
cremated.

There'd be something left. A belt

I need you to look at something.

The Doctor opens a folder. Inside is -- A PICTURE OF MALCOLM.

DOCTOR (CONT'D) (cont'd) *
Do you recognize this man?

Ed looks at the photograph -- The face means nothing to him.

ED
No.

A murmur in the room.

DOCTOR
Edward. This man, Malcolm Rivers *
has had a very troubled life. He
was convicted four years ago for
the murder of six people at a
roadside motel in a terrible rage.

The Detective tosses a collection of HORRIFIC CRIME SCENE
PHOTOS ONTO THE TABLE --

DETECTIVE
He did this.
im 3/11/02 103.

 

ro DOCTOR
X . } Detective. Please!

Malcolm (as Ed) stares at them, shocked by what he sees --

We see only fragments of them, death after death. The
locations of the murders don’t appear the same as those at
the Golden Palm and the victims are different too, but the
methods and body positions are eerily familiar...

Ed looks up at the Doctor.

DOCTOR (CONT'D) (cont'd) *
When faced with intense trauma,
Edward, a child’s mind can fracture ~-
! creating ‘disasociated identities’,
‘alters’ which possess no memory of
the pain and thus, allow the child to *
inhabit them free of it. This is what *
happened to Malcolm. He developed a
condition commonly known as Multiple
Personality Syndrome.

ED
Why are you telling me this?..

Cy) DOCTOR

(gently)
Because... you... Edward, are one
of his personalities.

For a moment, Ed's world stops. He sits in silence, trying to
make sense of what he's been told... Then he chuckles...

ED
«..What?..

The Doctor gives Ed -- A HAND MIRROR. He numbly looks at his
own REFLECTION -- Only it’s NOT HIS REFLECTION.

The reflection in the MIRROR is that of MALCOLM...

The MIRROR is dropped on the table and THE CAMERA WHIP PANS
TO A SHOT OF MALCOLM - STUNNED - HE TRIES TO STAND - BUT
REALIZES HE'S STRAPPED TO THE CHAIR - HE PULLS AT THE STRAPS -
SHOCKED ~ TERRIFIED - PANICKED!

MALCOLM
(as Ed)
Jesus Christ! Why am I -- Jesus!
_ WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON?!
i J WHERE IS MY FACE!?
 

jm 3/11/02 104.

| C) He catches sight of his reflection in the window --
-- and again sees Malcolm.

DOCTOR
Try to stay calm, Edward.

MALCOLM
(as Ed)
WHAT IS GOING ON?! WHERE IS MY
FACE?! WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO ME?!

DOCTOR
Edward... There’s a reason I am
doing this if you'll let me...

MALCOLM :
WHY AM I TIED DOWN?! LET ME OUT!
WHERE IS MY FACE!?

DOCTOR
Please,.. Edward...

MALCOLM
WHERE IS EVERYONE? WHO ARE THESE
PEOPLE?! WHAT HAPPENED AT THE
MOTEL? ...WHERE’S PARIS?

 

DOCTOR
.»-.The motel doesn't exist, Edward.
Except in the paradigm of Malcolm's
childhood. Nor do the people you
met there.

DOCTOR (CONT'D) (cont'd) *
You've been sharing a single mind
with ten others, Edward. You've
been living an episodic life.

MALCOLM
(as Ed)
YOU ARE A LIAR!

DOCTOR
Consider what you know. Everyone
named after a state. Everyone with
the same birthday. The blackouts.

MALCOLM
I WAS A COP. I WAS A COP IN THE
RAMPART DIVISION OF THE LAPD FOR
_ SIX YEARS!
(MORE)
Oy

 

MALCOLM (cont'd)
I LIVE IN HOLLYWOOD, IN A STUDIO
APARTMENT -- THE ELEVATOR SMELLS
LIKE CAT PISS! THE SIX BUTTON
DOESN’T WORK!

DETECTIVE
This is complete bullshit.

MALCOLM
(as Ed)
You don't believe me? Ten-Eleven
Vine. CHECK IT OUT! GO AHEAD.
CHECK IT OUT!

DOCTOR
You don’t live there, Edward. You
don’t live anywhere. Malcolm is in
the middle of a medical treatment.
One which forces co-consciousness.
One which brings all his identities,
including you, together. The motel
was a scenario. Suggested. to awaken
memories in Malcolm’s core. I knew
there would be violence and with it,
the number of identities would be
reduced.

Malcolm (as Ed) becomes still.

MALCOLM
«-.reduced?..

DOCTOR

Only one of the alters you've met
tonight committed these murders
four years ago, Edward. But in
nineteen hours, Malcolm will be put
to death for their actions, unless
I can convince that man --

(pointing. to the judge)
-- that theyare gone.

MALCOLM
So you’re killing us!?

DOCTOR
If I don’t succeed, you will all
surely die with Malcolm tomorrow.

MALCOLM
(as Ed)
I DON’T ...BELIEVE IT!

DOCTOR
I need you to. *

Malcolm (as Ed) stares at the Doctor -- utterly shattered...
tears run down his cheeks.

DOCTOR (CONT'D) (cont’d) *
I am trying to integrate a man’s
mind, Edward. To repair a life
fractured. And to purge a killer.
I need a single identity to
survive. There is only one body.

WE ARE CLOSE ON MALCOLM... The pulsing buzz rises. A
heartbeat... Light begins to fade. The sound of rain...

MALCOLM
(as Ed, becomming dizzy)
---What do you want from me?!..

SUDDENLY, THERE'S ANOTHER VOICE from one side of Malcolm -- A
distant scream -- Paris -- then A GUNSHOT. Malcolm (as Ed)
looks to the Doctor... he is fading into darkness...

MALCOLM (CONT'D) (cont’d) . *
(as Ed)
-.-Paris...

DOCTOR
Only one can survive, Edward.

Edward... Stay with me. I need you
to understand... (his voice fades)

Another scream --

AND Malcolm (as Ed) turns to the sound -- AS WE --

CUT TO:

EXT. DESERT NEAR MOTEL -- NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS *
Wide on the motel. Fifty yards away in the desert. The lights *
are out and we hear Paris screaming -~- *
WHIP PAN TO -- CLOSE ON -- ED -- standing in the rain. He’s *
been to hell and back. Emotional. Stunned. He gazes about, *
feeling the water on his face. The wind blowing. He looks t *

his own hand, touches his own face.

*

He turns from the motel and looks into the blackness of the
desert behind him. He could just walk away.

More screams from Paris -- another shot -- Ed turns back to
the motel. With resolve, he walks toward it. His footsteps
gather speed on the rain soaked sand. Suddenly we hear --

PARIS (0.S.)
...Ed! Stay with me -- ...Ed!

SMASH TO:
EXT. GOLDEN PALM MOTEL -- NIGHT/DAWN-- RAIN
ED FACES PARIS. He's slumped. Blood soaks his chest..

PARIS
Ed... ...Please let me help you.

Ed stares, life fading from him. His breathing shallow...
Paris knows he's been devastated in some way...

PARIS (CONT'D) (cont'd)
Why won't you let me help you!?

did you go?! What did you see?!..

WIDE -- dawn rises over the motel-- as Paris stands. She
walks calmly from Ed's body -- to Larry’s truck. It starts up
first time. The wheels spin in the mud as she pulls away...

EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY -- DAWN

The truck speeds east --
Directly into the sun that's dawning...

In the cab of the truck, Paris' has to squint into the bright
orange light...

DISSOLVE TO:
INT. HEARING ROOM -- DAWN

Malcolm sits in the chair... Smiling sernely...
Squinting as if staring into a bright light...

The Assistant D.A., the Detective, the Judge and Sharon the
stenographer all sit in stunned silence... Contemplating that
to which they've just beared witness...

DOCTOR
The question, your honor, is
whether to convict the body or the
mind. His body committed these
murders, that is true. But the
person who remains inside did not.
You witnessed the destruction of
ten souls tonight. Nine were
innocent. One was guilty. The
violence that existed in him has
been executed,

A long pause...
DEFENSE ATTORNEY
.»-Malcolm belongs at the state
hospital, your honor.

ASSISTANT D.A.

Parked in the center of the courtyard is a black van. And
there is the Doctor, exhausted from the long night, waiting
with two guards...

A set of security gates open and Malcolm is escorted toward
hwe car by two more Guards...

-- Malcolm is secured in the rear of the van with the *
Doctor... A second guard starts up the van... *

And the van pulis out slowly... *
INT. CORRECTIONS VAN -- CONTINUOUS *
Malcolm raises his head... And looks at the road ahead...

He smiles peacefully... The voices have stopped screaming.

The doctor looks proudly at his patient.

Sunlight flickers on Malcolm’s face.
We hear the sound of birds singing.

Citrus groves as far as the eye can see...

And there, speeding in the Florida sunshine -- A yellow
truck. And we see Paris, looking at the road ahead...

A mammoth task has been completed, but now the job of

CUT TO:
EXT. CITRUS GROVE -- DAY
CLOSE ON a real estate "SOLD" sign -- REVEAL --

Paris standing on the side of the road -- A huge smile on her
face as she looks at the small grove that's now hers...

She walks to the closest tree -- A ripening lime --
And touches it's bark fondly, whispering to it gently...

PARIS
Everything's going to be okay.

She kneels to the ground and scoops a handful of dirt with a
SERRATED GARDEN FORK -- She puts the fork down and crumbles
the dirt between her fingers, analyzing the fibers...

She takes a second handful... And realizes... There's
something under the dirt... Perhaps litter... She pulls it
out... It's a MOTEL KEY. She wipes away the dirt --

IT IS ROOM KEY NUMBER ONE.
The color drains from her face -~ She turns quickly -

And comes face to face with LITTLE TIMOTHY --
THE SERRATED FORK held at his side -

TIMOTHY
Hello.

MURDERS AT THE GOLDEN PALM and the corresponding MURDERS
MALCOLM AT THE ‘REAL’ MOTEL IN THE CRIME SCENE PHOTOS. Though
the sequence will be horrifying, the actual killing is off-

which this boy and man carry out their psychotic rage.
