                  showing that in the building are the offices of the New York Police Department.   DISSOLVE TO TITLE -   TITLE:
                   "BUREAU OF CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION"   DISSOLVE TO -   CLOSE SHOT - INTERIOR BUREAU - ON A FINGERPRINT
                  APPARATUS as the hand of official rolls the roller over the ink preparatory to taking fingerprints - as he does this and as
                  he takes the impression of each of the prisoners' fingers he speaks:  

VOICE:   Come on - give us the other one - Come on - come on.  Put it in there.  'Fraid to get it dirty?  What's the matter?
                   You've done this before.  This is nothing new to you.  Nothing strange about it.  Okay.

Inspector Fife, perhaps, has as many in Scotland Yard.


As he says this last CAMERA PANS to CLOSEUP on Inspector Fife -
FIFE:   Yes.  Unfortunately, the British Islands are also more civilized than the Hawaiian.

                  one -

FLANNERY:   Here.  Here's a man who's -

- hard to arrest.  Always has to be clubbed into submission.
CUT TO CLOSE SHOT on the three by files as Flannery finishes:
He's a hard nut. CHAN: Hard nut? FLANNERY: Yes - hard nut. CHAN:
(As he gets this) Oh, I see. Some heads, like hard nuts, much better if well cracked.


(All laugh)
FLANNERY: Right. (Puts record away in file) I want you to

CUT TO MEDIUM SHOT by Flannery - group and audience back of him.
FLANNERY: Come on out from behind those whiskers, Benny. (Turning around
                  to address audience back of him) This is Benny the dip. He used to imagine he was a pick-pocket but he couldn't
                  get his hand in and out -

DISSOLVE TO -  INTERIOR BARRY'S OFFICE -  CLOSEUP on Doctor Hammond. 
DR. HAMMOND: Unquestionably, gentlemen, a
                  case of heart failure.  I should say Sir Lionel has been dead over an hour. 


FIFE: He died in the line of duty. Although retired, he was still investigating unsolved
                  cases.


CUT TO CLOSEUP on Chan.
CHAN:   These are your offices, Mr. Kirk?
CUT TO CLOSEUP on Kirk and Fife.


KIRK:   Yes I - I turned them over to Sir Lionel and he's been stopping with me in my penthouse upstairs.
CUT TO MEDIUM SHOT shooting down on Fife, Chan and Kirk -- Doctor tipped in foreground.
FIFE:   Did he complain of illness?
CUT TO FULL SHOT on group around the desk - across which Sir Lionel is sprawled.
KIRK:   On the contrary, he was in fine spirits.  Said he was on the verge of solving an important case.  CHAN:  
                  Did he name case?  KIRK:   No. 

CUT TO CLOSEUP on Kirk and Fife as Kirk continues:

CUT TO MEDIUM SHOT on Fife, Chan and Kirk - Doctor in foreground tipped in.   (Shooting down) 
FIFE:   Who?  KIRK:   He gave his name -- I don't recall it. 
CUT TO CLOSEUP on Kirk and Fife.  Kirk continues: 
However, after Sir Lionel had been absent an hour, I sent my butler down and he found him -
CUT TO FULL SHOT on the group around the desk as Kirk finishes:
- as you see him. CHAN: (Addressing doctor) You
                  are positive, Honorable Sir, this man died of -


CUT TO CLOSEUP -- on Dr. Hammond - Chan's voice finishing through shot -
- heart failure?  DR. HAMMOND:  Positive, sir.  I would stake my professional - 
CUT TO CLOSEUP on Chan and Fife.   Dr. Hammond's voice finishes through shot - 
- reputation on it. CHAN: But who or what stopped heart? FIFE:
(Turning to Chan) What do you mean, Charlie? CHAN: (Looking at Fife) I
                  have seen strange thing in this room. FIFE: What? CHAN: House cat has not moved or taken breath since we came.


CUT TO MEDIUM SHOT on group of four.
KIRK:   Cat?  Why where?  CHAN:   Under that chair. 
CUT TO FULL SHOT in the room -  Chan moves toward foreground where a chair stands, and pushes chair a little back
                  -- below it lies cat. 

CHAN (Continued): Dead! FIFE: Is that your cat,
                  Mr. Kirk? KIRK: Yes. FIFE: When did you last see it? KIRK: Upstairs -


CUT TO CLOSEUP on Chan listening to voices continue through shot.
KIRK'S VOICE:   - just before dinner.  FIFE'S VOICE:  That's strange.  CHAN:   Very strange.  Cat is like
                  rich man's heir -- never dies out of sympathy. 

CUT TO MEDIUM SHOT on the four men around desk at which Sir Lionel lies dead.
KIRK: Well, you don't think there's a connection? CHAN: (Indicating
                  Sir Lionel) Prominent detective is about to catch criminal -- at this point detective is found dead.


FIFE: That may be mere coincidence, Charlie. CHAN: I always suspect coincidence
                  - (Indicates his nose) - same as nose always suspect ancient cheese. 


CUT TO CLOSE SHOT on Fife, Chan and Kirk.
FIFE:   You really think --
CUT TO FULL SHOT on the group around desk -
CHAN:   Yes.  Hold guests upstairs.  Telephone Inspector Flannery.  This is murder.
The men turn - Fife moves down to the desk telephone and as he raises it to call number -  FADE OUT.  FADE
                  IN  INTERIOR BARRY KIRK'S PENTHOUSE.  MEDIUM SHOT on group in room. 

FLANNERY: (To Paradise) Well go on, what happened then?
                  PARADISE: Why sir, Mr. Kirk sent me below for Sir Lionel and I found the office door and the window open and breeze
                  blowing all the papers about, sir. So I closed the windows, went into the private office and there, sir, I - I found Sir Lionel.
                  FIFE: Haven't I seen you before, somewhere? PARADISE: (Turning to Fife) I think
                  not, sir.


Flannery turns - camera moves over with him to take in the guests.
FLANNERY:   If anyone can throw any light on this affair I'd like it now.  It will be much pleasanter all around than if I
                  have to dig it up later.

CHAN: Identical! FIFE: Positive? CHAN: Could not be mistaken. FIFE:
                  It seems impossible we've blindly stumbled on the solution of this crime. CHAN: (Putting glass away in
                  his pocket) The impossible sometimes permits itself the luxury of occurring. FIFE: I think I'll take
                  this man in charge. CHAN: No --- wait -- we can watch. Do not wave stick when trying to catch dog. I am sorry this
                  happened. FIFE: Why? CHAN: It adds more water to an ocean of puzzlement. (Ticks off names on
