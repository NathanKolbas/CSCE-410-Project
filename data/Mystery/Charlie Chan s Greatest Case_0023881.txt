FADE IN:   Opening titles. One or two atmospheric shots of Honolulu, the Royal Hawaiian, boys on their surf boards,
                  the beach. 

SCENE 1 -- Omitted.   SCENE 2  EXTERIOR  CLOSE SHOT ON A DRAWN VENETIAN BLIND on the outside of a veranda.
                   Behind this blind we hear the voice of a man raised angrily. 

MAN'S VOICE: I've lived through thirty years of watching you besmirch the name of
                  Winterslip with sinful deeds, but this is more than I'll put up with. SECOND VOICE: (Lightly) Have
                  a drink, Amos.


DISSOLVE THROUGH BLIND INTO:   SCENE 3 INTERIOR DAN'S VERANDA  It is luxuriously furnished in attractive
                  wicker furnishings and looks as if it were the general living quarters of the household.  On a table is a framed photograph
                  of Dan's younger daughter, Barbara.  Discovered are Dan and Amos Winterslip, both men are in their early fifties, both dressed
                  in white linen.  Amos of stiff sanctimonious appearance, Dan just the opposite.  Amos holds a newspaper and shakes it in Dan's
                  face. 

AMOS:   When such disgraceful actions become the property of scandal columns, it's time something was done about it.
Amos indicates a particular item in the newspaper which has aroused his indignation.  Dan takes the paper from him calmly
                  and looks at it.  SCENE 4 INSERT OF PICTURE IN NEWSPAPER OF ARLENE COMPTON.  LAP DISSOLVE TO:  SCENE
                  5  NEWSPAPER ARTICLE ACCOMPANYING PICTURE which reads:

DAN'S VOICE: (Reads article aloud) "Having become accustomed
                  to expect about anything from Dan Winterslip, one of the Island's wealthiest and most colorful characters, we are prepared
                  to accept with calm, an announcement of his marriage any day now to Arline Compton, picturesque widow."


SCENE 6 INTERIOR VERANDA Dan reads the article and smiles provokingly, and puts paper down.
DAN: Tse. Tse. Imagine spelling her name wrong. AMOS: (Infuriated
                  by his manner) It isn't bad enough that everyone knows of your shady methods of the last thirty years. This trafficking
                  with a woman of this type is a disgrace to the name of Winterslip. Who is she? You know what they say?


Dan is beginning to burn but he compels himself to speak calmly.
DAN: No, Amos, what do they say? AMOS: (Virtually triumphant)
That her husband's plane crash was not an accident. He committed suicide. Because of her! (With disgust)
Flaunting around town the jewelry and flashy clothes you gave her. (He points to the picture of Barbara)
                  


SCENE 7 INSERT OF BARBARA'S PICTURE. We hear Amos' voice coming over insert. 
AMOS' VOICE:  What will your daughter say when she comes back from San Francisco?
SCENE 8 INTERIOR VERANDA Dan looks thoughtfully at the picture, rises and taking Amos' arm, leads him to the screen
                  door at the end of the veranda.   SCENE 9 SHOOTING THROUGH SCREEN, we see a white picket fence in the background
                  with Amos and Dan in foreground.  Dan points toward this fence. 

DAN:   Now, look here, Amos.  For thirty years you've lived on the other side of that fence, snooping around, watching my
                  activities and condemning me in your righteous heart.  You've refused to speak to me, denied me as a brother.  You've cursed
                  me and prayed to God to strike me dead for my sins.  And now you dare come over here and tell me how to live my life.

SCENE 10 CLOSE SHOT AT DOORWAY TO DINING ROOM. Koahla, man-servant, discovered eavesdropping on Amos and Dan.  Dan's
                  voice is heard.

DAN'S VOICE: (Quietly) Get out of here, Amos, before I forget
                  you are my brother.


SCENE 10A INTERIOR VERANDA
AMOS:   You'll pay for this.  You may have prospered in this life with your shady methods, but in the life to come, you'll
                  get yours.

Amos jerks open the screen door, stalks out slamming the door after him.  Amos exits.  SCENE 11 INTERIOR VERANDA
                  Dan has crossed to the table and is pouring himself a drink.  SCENE 12 EXTERIOR DAN'S GARDEN Amos, rushing
                  down the garden path, turns a heavily shrubbed corner and bumps into Minerva, very nearly knocking her down. 

MINERVA: (Catching her breath) Well! You're in enough hurry
                  to be going to a prayer meeting. AMOS: (Furiously) Perhaps if you went and prayed for your
                  brother, Dan, it wouldn't do any harm. MINERVA: (Amused) He's your brother, too. Why don't
                  you try it! AMOS: If something isn't done to stop him from going through with that affair, no Winterslip will ever
                  be able to hold his head up again. (Furiously) I'd see him dead rather than married to that woman.


With that, Amos goes on his way.  Minerva looks after him and then starts for the house.  SCENE 13 INTERIOR VERANDA
                  Dan has finished mixing his drink as Minerva enters.

DAN:   Hello, Minerva.  There's some mail for you.
He indicates a packet of mail on the table.  Minerva crossed toward it, talking as she walks.  Off-stage phone rings
                  twice and stops.

MINERVA: What happened between you and Amos? I heard you shouting all the way down
                  at the beach. DAN: (Chuckling) My most righteous brother finally broke his thirty years
                  silence to rebuke me, and assure me the Lord was about to strike me dead for my sins. (He shrugs)
                  Just a Puritan touched by the sun. Have a drink? MINERVA: (Starting to read letter) Make
                  it man-sized, I'm parched.


Dan begins to prepare a huge scotch and soda for Minerva.  Koahla, the native boy, enters.
KOAHLA: Mr. Egan of Reef and Palm Hotel on telephone again. DAN:
(Shortly) I have told you a dozen times I don't want to talk to him. KOAHLA: Yes, sir.


Koahla leaves and Dan hands Minerva her drink.
MINERVA:   Thanks Dan.
She takes a long swallow of the scotch.
(Referring to letter) Well, they're sending a policeman for me.


DAN: A policeman? MINERVA: (Smiles) Worse than that.
                  I could handle a policeman. They're sending John Quincy Winterslip, one of Boston's best.


Dan settles down into an easy chair and picks up the newspaper Amos has left.
DAN: What's he to me? MINERVA: Nephew. DAN: I don't understand why
                  they have to send him for you. Aren't you able to take care of yourself? MINERVA: He's the only available male in
                  the family. I've written to them that I'm enjoying myself, and that's more than they can tolerate. DAN: (Smiles)
I suppose he'll stop with our brother, Roger, in San Francisco. Why don't you wire him there and tell him to make
                  his home with us when he gets here? MINERVA: (Laughs) You don't know what you're letting
                  yourself in for, Dan. John Quincy is just like Amos thirty years ago without the touch of sun.


Dan, beginning to look over the newspaper, chuckles.  Minerva seats herself and enjoys her drink.  Suddenly, Dan sees something
                  in the paper which appears to upset him.  His expression changes.

DAN: (Harshly) Koahla!


He throws the newspaper aside, rises and crosses impatiently to the door, meeting the house-boy as he appears there.
DAN: (To Koahla) Is the car outside? KOAHLA: Yes,
                  sir.


Dan picks up his hat from a peg on the wall and starts for the screen door where he turns and looks back at Minerva.
DAN: I'm going down to the cable office. I'll be back in time for lunch.
(Exits)


Under the pretext of tidying room, Koahla picks up paper and exits.  SCENE 14 DAN'S HOUSE - ANOTHER ROOM Koahla
                  enters with paper in stealthy manner.  He reads the article which Dan has folded uppermost, with great interest.  SCENE
                  15 INSERT:  FOLDED NEWSPAPER -

"T.M. BRADE DUE
Next week, from India, comes T.M. Brade, retired British Civil Servant.  This is his first visit of the Islands, and is the
                  gratification of a life-long desire."

SCENE 16 INTERIOR DAN'S HOUSE This information seems to mean something to Koahla.  He tears the item out of the paper
                  -  SCENE 17 HALLWAY Kamaikui, coming down hall, calls - 

KAMAIKUI:   Koahla.
SCENE 18  KOAHLA hears the call.  He quickly slips the torn bit of paper into his pocket and, to avoid seeing Kamaikui
                  at this moment, nimbly slips over the window sill, drops to the ground and runs madly down the beach.   FADE OUT.
                    FADE IN:   SCENE 19  CLOSEUP ON LIFE PRESERVER attached to the railing on a ferry boat.  Inscribed
                  on it is:  

"TAMALPAIS, OAKLAND - SAN FRANCISCO" 
In the background we have a process shot of the bay and the San Francisco sky line.   DISOLVE TO:   SCENE
                  20  DECK OF FERRY - BOAT IN MOTION.  Same process shot in background. Colored porter loaded with eight pieces of elaborate
                  pigskin luggage which include a set of golf clubs and a hat box, comes into the scene. As the porter, exhausted, sets them
                  down, we notice that they are initialed "J.Q.W." and labeled "Boston." The porter wipes his brow and turns
                  grinning as John Quincy, a young man of twenty-eight, or so, immaculately clad and formal with cane and gloves, comes into
                  the scene. He tips the porter.

PORTER:   Thank you, sir.  First trip out here?
John nods briefly as if wishing to dismiss the man.
Some place, California, sir.  JOHN:   Yes, quite, thank you.  PORTER:   Yessah.
The porter goes on his way.  John leans against the rail looking out and frowning.  It is a misty day.  A hearty, middle-aged
                  man standing there observes John's impressive luggage.

MAN: First trip out this way? JOHN: (Coldly) Mm.
                  MAN: (Not at all daunted) Too bad it's so foggy. Unusual. As a rule this is the most beautiful
                  view in the world. JOHN: (Coldly polite) Is that so? MAN: Yes. Why, we have... JOHN:
(Bitingly) How fascinating.


The man realizes that John does not intend to respond to his cordial efforts.  He shrugs and moves away.  John sighs with
                  relief and gazes out over the water.  A second man comes over to him, notices the luggage and then says:

SECOND MAN:   Got a match, stranger?
John turns and observes him with restrained patience.
JOHN: No, sorry. SECOND MAN: First trip out this way? JOHN:
(Controlling a sigh) Yes. SECOND MAN: Great country. Too bad about the fog today. Unusual. Most of
                  the time you can see the Golden Gate and Mount Tamalpais. Great sight. Ever see Mount Tamalpais? JOHN: No. SECOND
                  MAN: Ha, ha. Of course not. Forgot you said you were never here before. Too bad it's foggy. JOHN: (In
                  cold, measured tones) I like the fog, do you mind terribly? SECOND MAN: (Gasping with astonishment)
                  I...oh...er...


The second man walks away.  John grits his teeth and turns back to his survey of the water, standing with his back full to
                  the camera.  Now Carlotta enters the scene and drops her heavy bag with relief.  SCENE 21 CLOSEUP OF JOHN as he
                  hears the bag drop.  His expression is one of extreme annoyance.  Anticipating the questions, he decides to nip them in the
                  bud and without looking around starts talking.

JOHN: (Wearily) Yes, it's my first trip out here. It's too
                  bad it's foggy or I'd see the Golden Gate and Mount Tamalpais and I haven't got a match.


SCENE 22 MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT - ANOTHER ANGLE For a moment Carlotta looks at him in astonishment.  Then she decides it
                  must be a game and why shouldn't she play it too?  Thrusting her hand in front of her coat, Napoleon-wise, and dropping her
                  chin on her chest, she assumes a deep bass voice.

CARLOTTA:   I would have conquered the world, and Wellington, too, if it hadn't been for Fouche.
John turns in astonishment to find Carlotta beside him.
CARLOTTA: (Continues the game. Very confidently) I'm Napoleon.
                  Who are you?


John continues to stare at her without answering.
CARLOTTA: (In profound sympathy) Haven't you really got
                  a match?


She opens her purse and hands him a packet.  Dumbfounded he takes them without being aware of the fact that he's done so.
CARLOTTA:   Don't tell me that you haven't a cigarette either?
She opens her case and offers John a cigarette.  John quickly hands her back the matches.
JOHN:   I'm terribly sorry.  I suppose it must have sounded quite crazy.  I beg your pardon.  CARLOTTA:   That's all
                  right.

She turns away smiling.
JOHN: (Annoyed by the smile) I'm not crazy really!


Carlotta hastens to assure him.
CARLOTTA:   All right, all right.
As if she is just a bit frightened, she starts to move away.  John pursues her a step, detaining her.
JOHN: Now, look here. I suppose you think I really am. And the more I insist I'm not,
                  the more you'll think I am. CARLOTTA: (Anxious to get away) Honestly, I promise you never
                  to think about it. May I go now? JOHN: But you are thinking it, I know. I'm afraid I became a bit annoyed by the hearty
                  cordiality of these people. Everyone felt obligated to assure me that this fog was unusual, and that this was really a beautiful
                  place. I was only trying to beat the next nuisance to it. CARLOTTA: (Stiffly) Oh, I see.


She turns to move away.
JOHN: (Hastily) No, really! I didn't mean... CARLOTTA:
                  I must say your manner of entering a flirtation is hardly alluring. JOHN: (Hastily assuring her)
But I'm not trying to enter a flirtation. CARLOTTA: (Pretending disappointment) Oh,
                  then I've been wasting all this time hoping... JOHN: (It suddenly dawns on him) I say, are
                  you trying to make a fool of me?


Carlotta smiles as if to say, "God's already done that."  Then she turns and surveys his luggage.
CARLOTTA:   Where are you bound for, stranger?  JOHN:   Hawaii.
Carlotta touches his hat box.
CARLOTTA: What's in here...a high hat? JOHN: (Formally) Naturally.
                  CARLOTTA: (Laughs) A high hat in Hawaii. Why you'll be taken for a missionary.


John looks chagrined.
(With mock apology) Oh, I'm sorry. It never occurred to me. Perhaps you are
                  a missionary.


John looks coldly at her and then, bending over his luggage, he deliberately picks up the box and throws it overboard.
JOHN:  Do you feel better?
Carlotta turns, concealing a smile, and sees -  SCENE 23 STOCK SHOT - FERRY SLIP  SCENE 24 MEDIUM
                  CLOSE SHOT -  

CARLOTTA:   Oh, we're coming in -
She picks up her bag and starts off.  John hurriedly begins to gather up his luggage, eager to go with her.
JOHN:   I say, why can't we go....I mean if you'll wait...that I'd like to...
Carlotta continues on her way, looks back smiling over her shoulder and calls a warning.
CARLOTTA:   Don't go native over there.
John, anxious to follow the girl, struggles with his luggage, picking up one piece and dropping another.  Finally he becomes
                  exasperated, looks at the luggage helplessly and mad through and through and shouts for help.

JOHN:  Porter!
While waiting for the porter, he begins to stack up the bags in as good order as possible.  The porter comes running to him
                  grinning and takes charge of the luggage, noticing as he does so, the Boston labels.

PORTER:   Yassuh.  First trip out this way, sir?  Too bad about the fog -
This is the final straw for John, who looks as if he could curse with rage. Then his sense
                  of humor gets the best of the situation. He laughs, as we FADE OUT. FADE IN: SCENE 25 EXTERIOR
                  SAN FRANCISCO STREET - NIGHT. An establishing shot. DISSOLVE INTO: SCENE 26 ANOTHER STREET. RESIDENCE
                  DISTRICT. NIGHT. CLOSE SHOT ROGER WINTERSLIP'S CAR as chauffeur opens the door and John and Roger get out. John looks at the
                  house with obvious distaste. SCENE 27 ACROSS STREET, MYSTERIOUS FIGURE LURKING IN SHADOWS, WATCHING. SCENE
                  28 EXTERIOR DAN WINTERSLIP'S SAN FRANCISCO HOUSE. CAMERA PANS UPWARD as John would see it, showing a three story house,
                  with windows boarded up, and a general air of desertion. SCENE 29 EXTERIOR DAN'S SAN FRANCISCO HOUSE. ROGER AND
                  JOHN. 


JOHN: (Protesting) Now look here, Uncle Roger. I demand
                  an explanation of all this mystery. I'm hardly off the ferry before you whisk me into your car, speed to your house, rush
                  through dinner without even a chance to wash up, and then dash out here. It's preposterous. ROGER: (Chuckling)
                  Practically everything your Uncle Dan does is preposterous, my boy.


He takes him by the arm and leads him up the stairs.  CAMERA TRUCKS ALONG with them.
Take this house, for instance.  He comes over here perhaps for two months a year, yet he goes to all the trouble of bringing
                  all his servants with him, and opening the place.  You'd think a hotel would do, but not for Dan.

By this time they have arrived at the door.  SCENE 30 ACROSS THE STREET we see a stealthy figure lurking in the
                  shadows, watching Roger and John.  SCENE 31 WATCHER'S ANGLE He sees them go into the house.  SCENE
                  32 INTERIOR DAN'S SAN FRANCISCO HOUSE - HALL AND STAIRWAY Roger takes flashlight from his pocket, and as the pale
                  light travels about we see the furniture swathed in ghostly linen covers, and the broad stairway leading up. 

JOHN: (Firmly) I'm sorry, Uncle Roger, but I refuse to go
                  another step unless I know what this is all about. ROGER: All right, my boy. Here you are. Orders from Dan.


Roger takes Dan's cable from his pocket, hands it to John Quincy, and turns the flashlight on it for him to read.  SCENE
                  33 INSERT OF CABLE: 

"ROGER WINTERSLIP   1438 MONROE ST.,   SAN FRANCISCO, CALIF.          WHEN NEPHEW ARRIVES TAKE   
                       HIM TO MY HOUSE.    IN OLD          TRUNK IN ATTIC WILL BE FOUND         SMALL STRONG BOX MARKED        
                  T.M.B.   HAVE HIM THROW IT         OVERBOARD INTO PACIFIC ON         WAY TO HAWAII   

                                 DAN"
SCENE 34  INTERIOR DAN'S HOUSE
JOHN: (Looking up impatiently) But it all seems so ridiculous.
                  If I understand it, I'm supposed to get this box of his and on the boat going over, drop it into the ocean. Is that right?
                  ROGER: Absolutely. JOHN: (Exasperated) Well, then, it's nonsensical. Evidently it
                  is of no value. Then why isn't it just as well off here as it is at the bottom of the Pacific?


Roger takes John by the arm with friendly force, and starts him up the stairs.
ROGER:   Because that's the way Dan wants it, my boy, and it's always wise to accommodate Dan.
SCENE 35 ATTIC A faint ray comes through a window high in a gable.  We can just discern the movement of a shadowy
                  figure, crossing the center of the room.  Then we hear Roger and John coming up the stairs, the light of the flash
                  preceding them.  The next moment they appear. 

ROGER:   I guess that's the trunk over there.
As Roger flashes the light on the trunk, the flashlight is suddenly struck from his hand.  He shouts.  John finds himself
                  struggling with an unseen assailant.  Roger joins in the scrap and the flashlight rolling crazily across the floor, throws
                  weird circles of light on the struggle.  Finding himself outnumbered, the mysterious stranger makes a break for the stairway.
                   We can hear his feet pattering on the steps as he runs down.  Roger picks up the flash and turns it upon John who is starting
                  after the intruder.

ROGER: Wait! JOHN: (Excitedly) Let's get him!


Roger has now turned the flash on the trunk which we see is opened, and is bending over it with the flashlight shining on
                  its contents.

ROGER:   If he's after what we're after, he didn't get it.
John comes to the trunk and looks into it.  SCENE 36 INSERT OF BOX IN TRUNK Plainly marked are the initials,
                  T.M.B.

JOHN'S VOICE: Aren't you going to notify the police? ROGER'S VOICE: (Slowly
                  - impressively) No. Dan never takes up any of his affairs with the police authorities.


SCENE 37 INTERIOR ATTIC Roger lifts the box out of trunk and John looks at it
                  curiously. SCENE 38 INSERT: PORTION OF THE BOX SHOWING "T.M.B." 


SCENE 39 INTERIOR ATTIC

 
JOHN: I wonder what's in it? ROGER: Part of Dan's past probably.


Roger turns the flash on John and sees a slight gash on his cheek.
ROGER: Are you hurt? JOHN: Not fatally. ROGER: (Closing
                  the trunk) Good. Let's get out of here.


They cross to the stairway and start down.  SCENE 40 SECOND FLOOR STAIRWAY As Roger and John come down, Roger
                  lighting the way with the flashlight.

ROGER:   The evening's still young.  Perhaps we can find a gay spot.  What would you like to do?
The CAMERA TRUCKS BACKWARD ALONG the hall as John and Roger cross to the staircase, leading down to the first floor.
JOHN:   Frankly, take the next train for Boston.
SCENE 41 INTERIOR OF LOWER HALL SHOOTING UP THE STAIRCASE As John and Roger start down.
ROGER: (Laughs) Don't let a little thing like this worry
                  you, John. Back in your Uncle Dan's day, survival was a question of who was fastest with his fists, gun or knife, as the situation
                  demanded.


By this time they are down the stairs and the CAMERA TRUCKS with them to the street door as John replies.
JOHN: (Dryly) How thrilling. I still prefer the next train
                  for Boston.


SCENE 42 MYSTERIOUS FIGURE ACROSS STREET, watching.  SCENE 43 INTERIOR HOUSE The two men come out and
                  Roger locks the door.  The CAMERA TRUCKS with them as they cross to the car.

ROGER: (With cordial severity) Young man, you're my guest
                  for two days. I'm going to show you this man's town and make you like it.


By this time they have arrived at the car.  As they get in -  SCENE 44 MYSTERIOUS FIGURE watching them out of
                  scene, and starting as if to follow.  QUICK FADE OUT AND INTO:  SCENE 45 INTERIOR NIGHT CLUB Shooting
                  through archway into supper room, dance number is being played and the dance floor in the center of the room is crowded. 
                  Roger and John enter from the left and stop in the archway.  They are met by the Captain, who greets them, and leads them
                  away.  SCENE 46 CUT TO NEARBY TABLE Cope, a man of about fifty, of military bearing, is seated with a man
                  friend.  They are looking in the direction taken by Roger and John. 

COPE: Who's that? MAN: Roger Winterslip. COPE: I thought his face
                  was familiar. Dan's brother, eh? MAN: That's right, you knew Dan well in the old days. I suppose you'll be seeing
                  him when you get to Hawaii. COPE: (Angrily) Not if I can help it. Hanging is too good for
                  Dan Winterslip. And I might be tempted to ---- (Catches himself and forces a laugh) I guess Hawaii's
                  big enough for the two of us.


Cope offers the man a cigarette from his case.
MAN: Oh yes, I remember now. You were once engaged to his sister, Minerva. COPE:
                  (Bitterly) We would have been married today if Dan hadn't interfered.


SCENE 47 EDGE OF DANCE FLOOR - TRUCKING Roger and John are skirting the dance floor.  Suddenly, from the dance floor
                  a woman's hand reaches into the scene, seizing Roger's shoulder.  THE CAMERA STOPS with Roger and John and then we see that
                  it is Barbara who has detained Roger.   Harry Jennison, a good-looking young chap in his middle thirties, is her dancing partner.
                   As he sees Barbara, Roger's face lights up.  

ROGER:   Barbara!  You little devil.  Why didn't you let me know you were in town?
He shakes hands with Jennison.
BARBARA: (Indicating Jennison) His fault. Our table's over
                  there... (Indicating table further along)


As Barbara speaks, she and Jennison are bumped into by a passing couple on the crowded dance floor.  Barbara and Jennison
                  resume dancing as Barbara calls over Jennison's shoulder.

BARBARA:   Join us?
SCENE 48 BARBARA'S TABLE Roger and John arrive at the table which is on the edge of the dance floor.  As they are
                  seating themselves, Roger says:

ROGER:   And that, my boy, is your cousin, Dan's daughter.  You'll probably be sailing on the same boat.  JOHN:  
                  She's very attractive.  Who's the man?  ROGER:   Harry Jennison.  Another Islander - been Dan's lawyer for years.
                  

As Roger speaks a waiter comes to the table, handing both men menus.  SCENE 49 NIGHT CLUB - CLOSEUP AT TELEPHONE
                  Cope is speaking into mouthpiece.

COPE: Hello, Anchor Steamship Company? -- This is Captain Cope. (Impatiently
                  and slowly) Captain Arthur Temple Cope...I've changed my mind about the 'President Tyler.' I can't wait two days
                  - (Waits) The 'Matsonia' or the Australian boat? Tomorrow at noon? Very well, the Australian boat.
                  Thank you.


Cope hangs up and turns from the phone.  SCENE 50 BARBARA'S TABLE The dance number is over and Barbara and
                  Jennison come back to the table.  John and Roger rise and Roger says:

ROGER:   You weren't going to sail without coming to see me, I hope?
He turns to John.
I want you to meet your cousin, John Quincy Winterslip - he's going to the Islands to bring your Aunt Minerva home.  JOHN:
                    How do you do?  BARBARA:   Welcome.

During this Roger and Harry are shaking hands and ad libbing "Glad to meet you," etc.
ROGER:   Oh, John - this is Mr. Jennison.
The men shake hands and murmur a friendly greeting.  The music starts up again for the second half of the dance, and Barbara,
                  full of animation, turns to John.

BARBARA: Want to finish the dance, John Quincy? JOHN: (Gravely
                  - formally) Thank you - (Turns to the men) Will you excuse us? ROGER: Go ahead,
                  my boy. JENNISON: Certainly.


John and Barbara step to the dance floor.   The CAMERA TRUCKS ALONG with them as they dance.  Barbara looks up teasingly into
                  John's serious face.

BARBARA: You look as if you missed something. Should we have kissed? JOHN:
(Flustered) Oh, really.... BARBARA: What do cousins do in Boston? JOHN: (Nervously
                  trying to joke) Er -- rub noses, I believe. BARBARA: What fun.


She stretches up and manages to rub his nose, much to his embarrassment.  However, he evidently has liked it.  She moves closer
                  to him in dance positions and then the CAMERA STOPS, allowing them to dance away and lose themselves amongst the other couples,
                  as we  FADE OUT.  FADE IN:     SCENE 51 LONG SHOT SHIP AT SEA - NIGHT  DISOLVE INTO: 
SCENE 52 EXTERIOR BRIDGE OF SHIP  Barbara and Jennison are talking with the Captain.  While they are
                  talking, Higgins, a passenger, joins them unobserved.

BARBARA: Captain Shane, what are the chances of beating the 'Matsonia' in? CAPTAIN:
                  (Smiles) Young lady, that would mean a whole day ahead of schedule. What's your hurry? BARBARA:
                  Oh, just an idea. JENNISON: (Indulgently) Some of her school friends sailed yesterday on
                  the 'Matsonia.' I expect she'd like to beat them. (Turns to Barbara) Isn't that it?


Barbara laughs.  Higgins moves into the group.
HIGGINS:   Would it be possible, Captain?  I'd like to get in a day ahead myself.
They all turn and see Higgins.
CAPTAIN:   Oh, good evening, Mr. Higgins.
Barbara and Jennison nod.
HIGGINS: Good evening. (To Captain) In fact, I'd give a
                  thousand dollars to the Seaman's Fund if you could make it. BARBARA: There you are, Captain.


The Captain looks a bit reluctant.
JENNISON: (Tempting him) You know that Japanese ship's record
                  still stands. With this good weather, you have a chance to beat it. BARBARA: (Coaxingly, snuggling up
                  to him) Oh, please, Captain Shane. CAPTAIN: Now, don't try any of your wiles on me, young lady.
(And with that he encircles her with his arm, holding her as he talks to Higgins) Such an offer, Mr. Higgins,
                  is a great inducement, I'll try. BARBARA: Oh, you darling! (She kisses him) CAPTAIN:
                  But I warn you, if we don't make it by five o'clock the evening before, we'll have to lie outside the harbor overnight. BARBARA:
                  But we will make it, I know. CAPTAIN: (Gives instructions) Full speed ahead.


SCENE 53  CLOSEUP INSTRUMENT as it advances to full speed.   SCENE 54  INSTRUMENT ROOM BERKELEY AND OFFICER
OFFICER: (Looking at his instrument) The old man's giving
                  her the works. Probably out to beat the record. BERKELEY: (Interested) If it brings us in
                  a day earlier, it will suit me right down to the ground.


SCENE 55 INTERIOR JOHN'S CABIN He is unpacking a bag, getting to the box, which he takes halfway out of the bag, when
                  there is a knock at the door.  He replaces it.

JOHN:   Come in.
The Reverend Frank Upton enters.  A missionary type, ascetic, austere.
UPTON: (With deep pompous tones) You're Mr. Winterslip?
                  JOHN: Yes. UPTON: My name is Upton. Reverend Frank Upton, Missionary. JOHN: Yes? UPTON:
(Severely) I noticed your name on the passenger list. Young man, you aren't by any misfortune related to
                  Dan Winterslip, are you? JOHN: He is my uncle. UPTON: Indeed! I knew him forty years ago. I hope since then
                  he's become an upright, god fearing, respectable man. JOHN: What was he when you knew him...a horse thief? UPTON:
                  Good gracious, no. There aren't any horses in the South Seas. JOHN: How unfortunate. How did he amuse himself? UPTON:
(Sternly) He was a Blackbirder.


SCENE 56 CLOSE SHOT John has uncovered the strong box.  We hear Upton's voice coming into the scene.
UPTON'S VOICE:   I met him when he was first mate on the 'Maid of Shiloh,' a blackbirding ship, owned by a man named Brade,
                  Thomas Michael Brade.

John looks sharply in direction of box.  SCENE 57 INSERT OF BOX Showing the initials "T.M.B." 
SCENE 58 MEDIUM SHOT John instantly covers the box and closes the bag, while Upton continues: 

UPTON: Brade died when they were in port, at the Apiang Islands. Dan brought him ashore
                  and buried him. JOHN: (Absently, looking toward the box) How amusing. UPTON:
(Astonished) Amusing, sir! JOHN: (Hastily) I beg your pardon. I was thinking
                  of the dinner you're missing. The food's really excellent on these boats. UPTON: (Sighs righteously)
                  There's too much thought of food for the body, and not enough thought of food for the soul. Now, if human beings would only
                  consider that their lives ----


John sees that Upton is about to launch forth with a sermon and eases him toward the door.
JOHN: You may be right, sir. Eating is probably just a bad habit. But the roast young
                  duck is really delicious. UPTON: (Smacking his lips) Roast young duck? My favorite. Will
                  you join me, sir? JOHN: Thanks, but I've already eaten. UPTON: Of course! (He is now in a hurry)
See you again. (He closes the door) JOHN: (To closed door)
                  Not if I see you first.


John moves quickly to the bag, and removes the box.  With he box under his arm, he comes to the door, opens it, looks up and
                  down the deck.  Satisfied, he exits.  DISSOLVE TO:  SCENE 59 DECK AFT It appears deserted as John
                  makes his way to the stern.  We see a figure leap from the shadows, snatch the box from John's upraised arms as he is about
                  to heave it overboard.  The figure whirls John around and trips him, making him sit down suddenly and disappears again into
                  the shadows.  John, astonished at this turn of events, which comes so quickly, turns, and cannot make up his mind
                  for a moment what to do.  SCENE 60 EXTERIOR DECK John running, rounds a corner of he deck.  He stops suddenly
                  and looks.  SCENE 61 EXTERIOR DECK - CLOSE SHOT From John's angle.  Upton, the missionary, carrying a black
                  box, enters a cabin.  SCENE 62 EXTERIOR DECK - MEDIUM SHOT John starts rapidly toward Upton's cabin, the CAMERA
                  FOLLOWING HIM.  He reaches a porthole opening on the cabin and looks in.  SCENE 63 INTERIOR UPTON'S CABIN - MEDIUM
                  SHOT Shot through porthole.  Upton has his back to the CAMERA.   On a dresser near the porthole is the box.    SCENE
                  64 EXTERIOR DECK - CLOSE SHOT John reaches his hand in the porthole and grabs he box.  SCENE 65 EXTERIOR
                  DECK - MEDIUM SHOT Hugging the box to him, John starts down the deck, the CAMERA following him.  As he passes, the CAMERA
                  moves in for a CLOSE SHOT.  John looks at the box and discovers that it is a graflex camera.  He looks around.  Seeing that
                  he is unobserved, he drops the camera on a deck chair and starts back toward Upton's cabin.  SCENE 66 EXTERIOR
                  DECK - MEDIUM SHOT - REVERSE ANGLE As John starts away from the deck chair, two young people appear from around a passageway.
                   They see the graflex, note John and pick the graflex up, starting after him.  SCENE 67 EXTERIOR DECK - CLOSE
                  SHOT As John reaches the door of Upton's cabin, it opens and Upton, agitated, comes out.  He halts John. 

UPTON:   Have you seen anyone around here in the last few minutes?  JOHN:  Why - no.  UPTON:   Someone has
                  just stolen my camera.

The two people who picked up the graflex enter.  The man addresses John.
MAN:   Pardon me - you left your camera back there.
He hands the graflex to John and they continue on.  Upton glares at John.
UPTON:   So!
He snatches the graflex away.
You are a true Winterslip, sir!
He slams into the cabin.  John continues on his way.  He then starts running in the direction he believes is taken by the
                  thief.  SCENE 68 DECK FARTHER ALONG Barbara and Jennison, in the partial shadow of a lifeboat, locked in passionate
                  embrace.  Into the foreground walks John.  He is about to walk right to where the couple is embraced, when they see
                  him and stop short.  They turn toward CAMERA.  John looks surprised, and then thoughtful, as he exits from scene.
                   Now the CAMERA ROLLS UP CLOSE to Barbara and Jennison.  SCENE 69 DECK Barbara and Jennison as they slip from
                  close embrace.

JENNISON: Will you marry me? As soon as we arrive? BARBARA: Yes, Harry. JENNISON:
                  I - I was almost afraid to ask you. BARBARA: I was almost afraid you weren't going to. (Happily)
I'm going to send a wireless to Dad. Come on. JENNISON: Why not wait until we get in, and surprise him? BARBARA:
                  I'd rather have him know now, so that he can have time to arrange a party for me. (She kisses him swiftly)
Come on.


She takes his hand, pulls him along.  He follows reluctantly.  LAP DISOLVE:  SCENE 70 INTERIOR WIRELESS
                  ROOM Barbara and Jennison are reading message she has finished writing.  SCENE 71 INSERT MESSAGE:

                   SCENE 73 EXTERIOR DAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT Dan's car waits in driveway.  We see a shadowy figure lurking. 
Back of a clump of bushes, evidently lying in wait for Dan.  Dan comes from the house and is about to step into his car
                  when this figure steps out onto the driveway and we see that he is a rather seedy looking Englishman, tall, wiry, about forty-five
                  years of age.  He steps close to Dan. 

MAN: (Taking hold of Dan's arm) Mr. Winterslip. DAN:
(Looks at the man and draws his arm away roughly) What is it? MAN: I don't suppose you remember me.
                  I'm Egan. DAN: Oh...you run the Reef and Palm Hotel. What do you want? EGAN: Twenty years ago I was a bank
                  teller in Sydney, Australia. We met there. DAN: (Brusquely) You're mistaken. EGAN:
(Darkly, positively) Oh, no, I'm not. (With foreboding menace) T.M. Brade is in
                  town! I suppose you never heard of him? DAN: (Angrily) No. EGAN: (Smiling
                  harshly) He's stopping at my hotel. It might be a good idea to give me a few moments privately with you before
                  he comes to see you. DAN: (Almost shouting in his anger) Now, look here. I don't know what
                  you're talking about, and if I catch you skulking around on these grounds again, I'll have you arrested.


Dan gets into his car and the car starts to move.
EGAN: (Half to himself) You'll see me.


DISSOLVE INTO:  SCENE 74 INTERIOR ARLENE COMPTON'S BEACH HOME  It is attractively shabby.  Arlene is a faded
                  bleached blond past thirty, who might once have been beautiful.  A victrola is playing.  Steve and Arlene are dancing to the
                  strains of seductive Hawaiian music.  There is a knock at the door.  Arlene motions to Steve to duck into the other room,
                  which he does nonchalantly, arranging his clothes.  Arlene arranges her hair, etc., and goes to the door.  She opens the door.

ARLENE:   Darling!  I didn't expect you so early.  DAN:   I can only stay a minute.  Listen, Arlene, I don't want
                  to seem an Indian giver, but you've got to do me a big favor.  ARLENE:   What is it, Dan?  DAN:  I've got
                  to have that emerald brooch back. 

It is obvious that Arlene has no intention of returning the brooch.  She stalls.
ARLENE: I....er...of course, Dan. But as a matter of fact, I can't give it to you
                  now. It's at the jewelers having the clasp fixed. DAN: (Harshly) Why didn't you bring it
                  to me to have it fixed? I told you no one should see that brooch. ARLENE: Did you dear? I'm so sorry, I forgot. DAN:
                  It's vitally important that I get it back immediately. I'll give you something in place of it --- ARLENE: All right.
                  I'll get it for you tomorrow. (Brightly) Oh, I know what you can get for me in exchange. Do you
                  remember that darling emerald necklace we saw in the arcade of the Royal Hawaiian? DAN: It is as good as yours. ARLENE:
(Gratefully) Darling! (Sweetly) Don't you want to sit down, have a little drink,
                  and -- (The rest of her sentence is implied) DAN: I can't. I've a business engagement that
                  won't wait. Goodbye.


He starts for door.
ARLENE: (Babyishly) Are you going to kiss 'ittle Arlene
                  goodbye?


He takes her in his arms and kisses her perfunctorily.
DAN:   Goodbye.
The moment he's out of that door, Arlene crosses to a chest of drawers and takes out a brooch.  SCENE 75 INSERT
                  of old-fashioned brooch in Arlene's hand.  SCENE 76 INTERIOR ARLENE'S BEACH HOUSE Arlene looks at the brooch
                  as if it were a valuable piece of property.  The door of the bedroom opens and Steve Leatherbee, an obvious pimp type, enters
                  the room.  He calmly takes the brooch out of her hand. 

STEVE: Listen you! I'm sick of this joint, see? I gotta get back to New York and the
                  mob. You been playin' this mug for months, and all you got is some cheesy clothes and a phony piece o' joolry. I want cash,
                  quick, and plenty of it. Now get busy! ARLENE: I'm trying my best. STEVE: Trying ain't good enough, see? Start
                  doing. ARLENE: (Coming to him coquettishly) And if I do, what happens? STEVE: What
                  do you think?


He kisses her.  FADE OUT.  FADE IN:  SCENE 77 ANCHOR PLUNGING INTO WATER.  DISSOLVE INTO:

                  including John, Jennison, Barbara, Berkeley and Higgins.  Conversation ad lib concerning the disappointment at failing to
                  arrive in time to make the harbor.

CAPTAIN:   I'm sorry...I did my best, but I warned you.  A WOMAN:   I don't see why...it's so silly to wait out here
                  for a quarantine...nobody has smallpox.  CAPTAIN:   Port regulations, Madame.  We dock at nine in the morning.

The crowd, disappointed, moves away, ad libbing "Too bad", "What a shame", etc.  Higgins lingers behind
                  the others.

HIGGINS:   Listen, Captain, I've got to get ashore tonight.  Couldn't one of your men take me in, in a small boat?  CAPTAIN:
                    Not a chance, Mr. Higgins, I'm sorry.

The Captain walks away.  Higgins moves to the railing and gazes frowningly toward the shore.  SCENE 79 EXTERIOR

BERKELEY: (Speaking to the quartermaster) Higgins seems
                  anxious enough to try to swim it. QUARTERMASTER: He'd better not try it unless he's an expert. It's a good two miles.


SCENE 80 ANOTHER PART OF DECK Barbara, Jennison and John.
BARBARA: Dad will be disappointed. I'll bet he has a party all ready. JENNISON:
(To John) And after one or two of Dan Winterslip's parties, you'll never go back, John. JOHN: I'm
                  sure I'll return to Boston. BARBARA: (Laughs) Aunt Minerva once said something like that,
                  but she traded her lorgnette for a ukelele.


DISSOLVE INTO:  SCENE 81 EXTERIOR DAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT The house is in darkness.  An automobile rolls up to
                  the driveway, stops and Minerva gets out, carrying a ukelele.

MINERVA: (To occupants of car) Don't bother to come in with
                  me. I'm quite all right. I've had a delightful evening. Thank you. VOICES OF A MAN AND A WOMAN: Goodnight...goodnight.
                  We'll go again sometime. See you soon. MINERVA: Yes, goodnight.

                  SET Through wide open door we can see the veranda bright with moonlight.  At first the only sign of movement is the illuminated
                  dial of a wrist watch moving in the shadows.  Minerva enters.  Instantly, the dial stops moving, then apparently the wearer
                  slips stealthily through some thin hangings into the dining room.  Minerva gives a startled gasp and hastens from the room
                  by another door.  SCENE 83 INTERIOR HALL Minerva comes to servant's door and knocks very lightly.

MINERVA: (Softly) Koahla.


The native boy, fully dressed, suddenly appears behind Minerva from the darkness of the hallway.
MINERVA: (Turns to him) Someone downstairs prowling about.
                  Come quickly.


They go quietly down the hall.  SCENE 84 INTERIOR LIVING ROOM Minerva and Koahla enter.  She turns on the
                  light.

MINERVA:   Look in the dining room, Koahla.
Koahla obeys, but finds no one there.
Where is Mr. Dan?  KOAHLA:   I think asleep.
Minerva crosses to the door leading to the veranda.  SCENE 85 INTERIOR VERANDA In the moonlight we can faintly
                  see Dan lying half off the couch, face upward, one arm hanging limp, the other twisted behind his back.  Minerva raises her
                  hand to her mouth suppressing a scream.  Koala runs to her side.

MINERVA:   Dan!
Realizing that Dan is dead, Minerva stumbles back, saying unsteadily, and grabs the back of a chair.
KOAHLA:   I call police.  MINERVA:   No.
She goes into the living room.  Koahla, after a frightened look at the murdered man, follows.  SCENE 86 INTERIOR
                  LIVING ROOM Minerva crosses to the phone.

MINERVA: (To Koahla) Bring me a drink, Koahla. KOAHLA:
                  Yes, madam.


He hurries into the dining room.  Minerva picks up phone.
MINERVA: The Royal Hawaiian Hotel, please. (Waits) Captain
                  Arthur Temple Cope, please.


She waits.  SCENE 87 CLOSE SHOT Hotel operator at telephone.
OPERATOR:   Captain Cope is not in.
SCENE 88 INTERIOR LIVING ROOM
MINERVA:   Not in his room?
SCENE 89 CLOSE SHOT - Hotel operator.
OPERATOR:   Shall I have him paged?
SCENE 90 INTERIOR LIVING ROOM Minerva looks at her watch.  SCENE 91 INSERT OF WATCH showing the time to
                  be 1:20.  SCENE 92 INTERIOR LIVING ROOM

MINERVA: (Into phone) No, thank you. 


She hangs up, then jiggles receiver. 
MINERVA: Three eight seven, please. (She waits. Koahla brings her drink.
                  She drinks.) Amos? Is that you, Amos? This is Minerva. Come over here as quickly as possible. 


Evidently Amos at the other end starts to protest. Minerva cuts him short.
Please, Amos, this is no time for nonsense... your brother is dead... murdered...
She hangs up.  DISSOLVE TO:  SCENE 93 INTERIOR POLICE STATION Captain Hallett at desk, talking into
                  phone.

CAPTAIN HALLETT:   Hello.  Who?  Yes?  Murdered!  I'll be right over.
Hallett hangs up, then jiggles receiver once or twice.
HALLETT:    Get me Charlie Chan.
SCENE 94 INTERIOR CHAN'S LIVING ROOM The dark room is splotched with moonlight.
                  The telephone is ringing loudly. NOTE: Throughout all the short scenes that follow, the telephone bell continues to
                  ring. SCENE 95 INTERIOR BEDROOM Twin beds occupied by Chan and his wife. They are waking to the sound of the
                  telephone bell. SCENE 96 INTERIOR BEDROOM QUICK FLASHES of each of Chan's eleven children waking.


SCENE 97 INTERIOR CHAN'S LIVING ROOM Chan, folding dressing gown about him, enters,
                  followed by Mrs. Chan.


MRS. CHAN:   What is the matter?  CHAN:   Even wisest man cannot answer until he knows question.
Chan makes a light while he speaks.  In rapid succession all the eleven children come hurrying into the room, in various stages
                  of undress, watching while Chan lifts the telephone receiver.

CHAN: (Into phone) Yes? Oh. Unfortunate. I shall come with
                  speed of wind if my dishonorable car permits. Thank you.


Chan hangs up and hastens from the room to dress.  Mrs. Chan follows.  Now the children begin scurrying about.  One
                  gets Chan's flashlight, another gets his gun from the drawer, one of the very small ones gets his coat and is nearly hidden
                  under it, trying to carry it.  He looks like a Chinese Skippy.  They all rush into the other room.  SCENE 98 INTERIOR
                  CHAN'S BEDROOM Chan is now almost dressed.

OLDEST BOY: (Handing him the gun) Don't forget to get fingerprints,
                  Pop. ANOTHER BOY: (Putting flashlight in his pocket) I think you ought to wear a disguise.


Through all this, Chan smiles indulgently and then begins looking about on the floor.
CHAN:   Where are my shoes?
At this, into the room comes Chan's youngest, a tiny child, the shoes seem enormous.
CHAN:   The smallest jewel is sometimes brightest.
He puts on his shoes while one of the boys laces them for him, pleading with Chan while he does so.
BOY: Take me along, Pop, will you? I'll be good. CHAN: (Smiling)
You are only good when sleeping and you never sleep.


Chan is now dressed.  He stands up and Mrs. Chan hands him his hat.  He turns to the children clustered about him.
To bed now with much haste.
He waves the children away and they scamper off.
(Smiles) All chips off ancient block.


As he turns to go out, FADE OUT AND INTO:  SCENE 99 INTERIOR DAN'S LIVING ROOM Discovering Minerva, Captain
                  Hallett, a policeman and a doctor.  Hallett is questioning Minerva.

HALLETT:   Nothing has been touched?  MINERVA:  No.  HALLETT:   Good.  All right, doctor.
Hallett motions in the direction of the veranda, and the doctor nods and exits to veranda.
HALLETT: All right. Now, from the beginning. You live here? MINERVA: (Resents
                  his brusque tone) I'm visiting. HALLETT: Hmmm. MINERVA: (Sharply) "Hmmm"
                  nothing, my good man, I'm the...his sister.


The doctor appears in the doorway and calls.
DOCTOR:   Captain Hallett.  HALLETT:   Right.
Hallett crosses and both he and the doctor go to the veranda.  SCENE 100 VERANDA The doctor and Hallett are
                  leaning over the body of Dan.

DOCTOR: Stabbed through the heart. Not been dead an hour. And look at this (Turns
                  the body over so that one arm falls limply) Arm broken. This job was done by either a very powerful man or someone
                  well versed in the Japanese art of Jiu Jitsu. HALLETT: Hmmm.


He turns and goes back into the living room.  SCENE 101 INTERIOR DAN'S LIVING ROOM Minerva sits stiffly upright
                  in her chair and as Hallett approaches her, looks at him a little belligerently.

HALLETT: Now, let's see. What did you say your name was? MINERVA: I didn't
                  say. I wasn't asked. Minerva Winterslip. HALLETT: The doctor tells me Mr. Winterslip has been dead a very short while.
                  If you can give me any idea as to... MINERVA: I can give you a very definite idea. It happened within two minutes
                  of fifteen past one. HALLETT: (Stares at her) You're sure of that? MINERVA: Certainly,
                  I'm sure. I got the time from the wrist watch of the person who committed the murder. HALLETT: (Astonished)
                  You...what! You saw him! MINERVA: (Coldly) I didn't say that. I said I saw
                  his wrist watch. The dial was illuminated. And if it will be of any assistance to you, the numeral indicating the hour two,
                  was slightly obscured. HALLETT: Well! You certainly had your wits about you. MINERVA: Where else should they
                  be?


Minerva rises and crosses to a window as if to draw the blind.  Suddenly she bends a trifle, looking out into the garden and
                  exclaims:

MINERVA:   There!  In the bushes!
Without waiting for Hallett, Minerva makes a dash for the door.  Hallett follows.  SCENE 101-A EXTERIOR DAN'S
                  GARDEN  Minerva comes upon a crouching figure and is about to seize hold of it when the figure straightens and we
                  recognize the bland face of Chan.  Hallett comes hastily up and exclaims:

HALLETT:   Oh, Charlie.  What are you doing out here?  CHAN:   Like when eating orange.  Start outside and work to
                  center.

Chan shows him a small white object he has picked up.  SCENE 102  INSERT Small cigarette butt in Chan's fingers.
                   SCENE 103 EXTERIOR DAN'S GARDEN

MINERVA: Who is this man? HALLETT: This is Mr. Chan, Miss Winterslip.
(Explaining to Chan) Miss Winterslip is a sister to the deceased man. CHAN: Most unfortunate. Be
                  generous to accept my most unworthy condolence. MINERVA: What has he to do with this? HALLETT: Mr. Chan will
                  have charge of his case. MINERVA: (With asperity) Charge of the case? A Chinaman! CHAN:
                  Humbly suggest not to judge wine by barrel it is in. MINERVA: Well, I never...I see where I'll have to send to Washington
                  for assistance. The idea! CHAN: It is not easy to make fire in cold stove. Politely request cooperation for good of
                  all. (To Hallett) May we proceed to scene of most upsetting crime?


They all turn and start back into the house.  DISSOLVE TO:  SCENE 104 INTERIOR DAN'S LIVING ROOM It
                  is evident that Chan has been questioning Minerva for some time and she shows signs of fatigue.

MINERVA:   I've told you all I know about it.  CHAN:  Most helpful.  Thank you so much.  The servants?  MINERVA:
                    I'll call them.

She crosses to the thin curtains that hang from the dining room doorway.  As she does so, Chan quickly crosses to the door
                  on the opposite side of the room and pulls it open.  Both Koahla and Kamaikui have been leaning against it, crouching.  They
                  now come into the room.

CHAN: To be found listening to what is not meant for your ears is to show that you
                  have something to conceal. (To Koahla) Speak! What do you know about this lowly deed? KOAHLA:
(Surily) I go sleep early. Know nothing. MINERVA: (Sharply) You weren't
                  asleep when I called you. You weren't even in your room. KOAHLA: Went for drink water. CHAN: More later.
(To Kamaikui) And you? KAMAIKUI: Many people here tonight. CHAN: Who? KAMAIKUI: No
                  see. Go to bed early. But cannot sleep. Hear loud talk. First man he shout and go. Then woman and man shout and go. Everybody
                  come and shout and go and come back. Mr. Winterslip shout too. CHAN: You understand what they say? KAMAIKUI:
                  No.


Now over the scene comes the loud, righteous voice of Amos.
AMOS' VOICE:   The wages of sin are death.
SCENE 105 INTERIOR DAN'S LIVING ROOM - ANOTHER ANGLE They all turn quickly to find Amos standing tall and fanatic
                  looking in the doorway.

MINERVA: (Nervously) For goodness sakes! (To
                  everybody) This is Mr. Winterslip, my brother. AMOS: (Entering the room) I
                  warned you as to the outcome of all this, Minerva.


Chan approaches Amos quietly as latter seats himself in the nearest chair and drops his straw hat on the floor beside him.
CHAN: You mention warning of outcome. Humbly ask you tell what you know of this. AMOS:
                  I know one thing! You cannot live a life of sin, and hope to be rewarded in the hereafter. CHAN: Profound wisdom,
                  but not helpful at present. How did you learn of crime? AMOS: My sister called me on the phone and I notified the
                  police. CHAN: You live but short distance? AMOS: Yes. CHAN: Why did you not come right over? Were
                  you already in bed? AMOS: No. CHAN: What have you been doing since telephone call? AMOS: I have been
                  praying for his soul. MINERVA: (With asperity) That doesn't help these gentlemen either,
                  Amos. (Thinking) Now that I think of it, I remember a man named Egan calling on the phone a dozen
                  times. Dan refused to talk to him. Perhaps.... CHAN: Egan...Reef and Palm Hotel. Most helpful. Thank you so much.


Chan turns slowly away from Amos and crosses the floor as if he is thinking deeply.  Suddenly his sharp eyes encounter something
                  on the floor.  He quickly stoops.  SCENE 106 BIG CLOSEUP of Chan's hand picking up a piece of seaweed and turning
                  it over once or twice, investigating it.  SCENE 107 MEDIUM SHOT Chan straightens and puts the seaweed in his
                  pocketbook without a word, although both Minerva and Amos have observed his action with curiosity.  As Minerva is about to
                  question him concerning it, Chan quickly diverts her by looking at his watch and saying:

CHAN: Time most rapidly flying to three o'clock. Humbly suggest we all try to get
                  sleep. MINERVA: (Indignantly) Sleep! With the murderer prowling about free. CHAN:
                  Only make haste when catching flea. MINERVA: Really, Mr. Chan.


Chan picks up his hat and crosses to the door.  Turning:
CHAN:   Good night.  Worry not.  What is to be is to be and inscrutable fates very busy arranging program.
Chan leaves.  Minerva and Amos sit in silence for a long moment, and then Minerva suddenly remembering, exclaims:
MINERVA: Poor Barbara. What shall I tell her when she gets off the boat in the morning?
                  AMOS: (Sanctimoniously) No matter how painful, the truth is always best.


He picks up his hat, rises and starts for the door.  Minerva looks after him, her brows knit.  As he reaches the door, she
                  calls sharply:

MINERVA: Amos! AMOS: (Turns) What is it? MINERVA:
(Slowly) What do you know about this, Amos?


Amos shows nervousness and is almost too greatly astonished:
AMOS:   I?  You must be mad, Minerva.
He turns hastily and leaves.  Minerva gazes after him wonderingly, then rising, starts across the room as if to turn
                  out the lights, when coming to the veranda she hears native voices raised in violent argument.  She starts for the veranda.

KOAHLA AND KAMAKUI'S VOICES: (Vident argument in native tongue)


SCENE 108 VERANDA Kamaikui and Koahla are discovered in what amounts almost to a struggle.  Kanaikui is clutching
                  something and Koahla is trying to wrest it from her.

MINERVA: (Coming into scene) What's going on here?


Koahla looks at her furtively and then slinks away.  Kamaikui approaches Minerva holding some object in her outstretched hand.
KAMAIKUI:   I find this here on porch.  He try to take it.
She hands the object to Minerva who takes it and looks down at it curiously.
MINERVA:   To whom does it belong?  KAMAIKUI:   Many, many years, Mr. Dan have this and more just like it.  Last month
                  he give this to woman down beach.  MINERVA:   Don't mention this to anyone, Kamaikui.  KAMAIKUI:   No. 
MINERVA:   Thank you.  Good night.

Kamaikui leaves and Minerva looks down again at the object she is holding.  SCENE 109 INSERT of Minerva's hand
                  holding the brooch which we last saw in Arlene Compton's possession.  FADE OUT.  FADE IN:  SCENE 110
                  VERANDA - DAY John and Minerva.  John is pacing back and forth.

JOHN: But Aunt Minerva, this is incredible. MINERVA: It isn't incredible.
                  It's a horrible fact, and we've got to face it. Something must be done about it. JOHN: The best thing we can do is
                  take the next boat for Boston. MINERVA: I'm not leaving here until we get to the bottom of this. (Scornfully)
I hope you don't expect Amos to take care of it! JOHN: He could be as helpful as you. MINERVA:
(Dryly) Thank you. And now, John Quincy, I'll tell you something else. (With provoking calm)
Not only am I staying, but you are too. JOHN: (Impatiently) In heaven's name, why?
                  MINERVA: There's Barbara. JOHN: But Jennison's been acquainted with all these facts. Since he and Barbara
                  are going to be married, he certainly will take care of her affairs. MINERVA: All that doesn't find the murderer.
                  JOHN: How about that Oriental Sleuth you told me about? MINERVA: (With scorn) A
                  Chinaman! Why, even the police in Boston need prodding. When I lost my little dog, Abigail, I finally had to see the police
                  commissioner before I got the slightest aid in recovering her. (Triumphantly) But they found her!
                  And that's what I want you to do. Accompany this Mr. Chan, and keep him from falling asleep under palm trees. 


JOHN: (Sighs) Where do I find the Honorable Mr. Chan? MINERVA:
                  Dozing at his desk in the police station, I'm sure. JOHN: (Dryly) Hail, the new detective!


John picks up his hat and leaves.  SCENE 111 INTERIOR BARBARA'S ROOM The door is partly open.  Her luggage
                  still unpacked is in the room.  Barbara, wearing the clothes she has arrived in that morning, reclines on a chaise longue,
                  weeping brokenly.  Jennison, very tender and solicitous, is with her.

BARBARA: But I can't understand it, Harry. You know Daddy doesn't have an enemy in
                  the world. JENNISON: He shouldn't have had. He was one of the finest men I ever knew. BARBARA: (Suddenly)
Uncle Amos! He always hated Dad! Oh, no! I can't believe that!


She sobs.  Jennison bends over her, taking her hand and kissing it gently.
JENNISON: Please don't, Barbara. BARBARA: (Controlling herself)
                  It's so good to have you, Harry. You'll take care of everything? JENNISON: Of course, dear.


There is a light knock on the partly opened door and Minerva enters with a cup of hot coffee for Barbara.  As she crosses
                  the room, Minerva says:

MINERVA: I want you to drink this, child. JENNISON: (Preparing
                  to leave) I've got to go now, Barbara. Try and get some rest, won't you?


Barbara makes a pathetic attempt to smile bravely.
BARBARA:   I'll try.
Jennison kisses her on the forehead.
JENNISON:   I'll be back soon.
Jennison leaves.  Barbara clings to Minerva who sets the coffee down and puts her arms around the girl.
MINERVA:   There, there, dear.
SCENE 112 EXTERIOR DAN'S DRIVEWAY Jennison's roadster is parked here.  Jennison comes from the house.  At the same
                  time Amos is walking along driveway on his way to the house.  They meet at the car.

AMOS: Ah, I was wanting a word with you. JENNISON: Yes? AMOS: I feel
                  it is my duty to take a hand in my brother's affairs....go over his private papers, in fact. JENNISON: (Firmly)
Barbara has asked me to attend to all that, Mr. Winterslip. AMOS: (Raising his voice) I
                  am the logical one, I should think. JENNISON: (Crisply) After all, I am his attorney. AMOS:
                  That is exactly why I make my request. Perhaps I know more about your association with my brother than you think.


The two men look at each other with repressed antagonism, each showing a certain wariness.  Jennison shrugs.
JENNISON:   Very well. Would this evening suit you?  AMOS:   Right now would be even better.  JENNISON:  
                  I'm sorry.  I have some other business to attend to now and I promised to spend the remainder of the day with Barbara. 
AMOS:   Very well, then, this evening.

Jennison glares after him, gets in his car and drives off.  Amos continues on into the house.  SCENE 113 INTERIOR
                  SMALL RESTUARANT Chan is seated alone at a table near the window as we see printed in reverse on the window:

"THE ALL-AMERICAN RESTAURANT"
A Japanese waiter comes to the table with a piece of pie and places it in front of Chan.  Chan inspects the pie gravely and
                  then calls:

CHAN:   Waiter!
The waiter returns.
Be kind to summon proprietor of his unworthy establishment.  WAITER:   Please to state your complaints.  I am also
                  proprietor.  CHAN:   This sector of pie appears most unhygienic.  It is my unfortunate lot to look for fingerprints
                  in my profession.  But when they appear in pie, they are neither helpful nor tasty.

The waiter picks up the pie and exits with it.  John Quincy enters the cafe, looks around, sees Chan and comes to his table.
JOHN: Mr. Chan? CHAN: Most correct. JOHN: They told me over at the
                  station that I'd find you here. I am John Quincy Winterslip. CHAN: (Rises) Most honored.
                  Pray accept this unworthy chair. JOHN: (Sitting down) I arrived on the 'President Tyler'
                  this morning from Boston. Dan Winterslip was my uncle. CHAN: Most unfortunate and disagreeable homicide. It is proper
                  for me to infer that you wish to speak of distressing incident? JOHN: Yes. I'd like to accompany you in your investigations.
                  I won't pretend that I'll be of much assistance, but I promise not to be a hindrance. CHAN: Your desire is my great
                  delight. If for no other reason than your refreshing employment of extravagant English which is rare here. Most helpful to
                  my meager vocabulary. JOHN: Have you formed any theory as yet regarding the crime? CHAN: Theories like fingerprints...everybody
                  has them. Only facts and motives lead to murderer. (Suddenly remembering) Oh, thousand pardons!
                  Dry up plate of soup, perhaps? JOHN: No, thank you. CHAN: Then let us be on our way. We shall gather us to
                  Captain Hallett and make for the Reef and Palm Hotel. (Calls) Proprietor! 


Chan picks up the slip on the table which is his check.  The waiter comes into the scene.
CHAN:   I pay most unwillingly.  Anxiously await day when law considers such food major crime.  WAITER:   Thank you.
Chan and John leave the restaurant.  SCENE 114 EXTERIOR STREET  Chan's antiquated Ford is parked at the
                  curb.  Chan and John come into scene.  Chan removes huge lock from front wheel of car.  John watches him, amused.

JOHN: (Dryly looking car over) I suppose you carry insurance,
                  too? CHAN: Every kind. (With elaborate gesture) Please to enter. A most humble chariot but
                  always reliable like model wife. JOHN: (Looking Ford over) Sort of Model T wife, eh? CHAN:
                  Just so, good joke.


Chan and John get in car.  Chan unlocks and works several contraptions.  Chan steps on the starter, a bit nervously but when
                  the car responds and motor starts, he sighs with relief and they start out.  DISSOLVE TO:  SCENE 115 EXTERIOR
                  REEF AND PALM HOTEL It is a weather-beaten frame building, part of it is extending on rickety piling out over the water.
                   A riotous garden surrounds it on the rear and two sides.  Chan and John drive up in Chan's Ford.  Behind them comes Hallett
                  in his car.  All three get out of cars.

HALLETT: (Looking at John) Who's this? CHAN: Great
                  pleasure in presenting nephew of deceased man. It is his wish to accompany us. HALLETT: (Gruffly)
Well, all right, but just leave the actual business of all this to us. JOHN: (Stiffly) I
                  never intended otherwise, I assure you.


They start for the dilapidated stairway leading up to the entrance of the hotel when Egan comes running down the stairs. 
                  He is about to brush past the three men when Hallett stops him.

HALLETT: Hey, you, Jim Egan, just a minute. EGAN: (Turning)
Yes? HALLETT: We want a few words with you. EGAN: I'm frightfully sorry, old man, but I have a most
                  pressing date and I'm late as it is. Some other time.... HALLETT: (Like a bullet) Now! EGAN:
(Without raising his voice) Impossible. I've got to get down to the dock within five minutes....


Hallett seizes Egan by the arm and begins to force him back up the stairs again.
HALLETT: Inside, you. EGAN: (Furious) Take your
                  hands off me, you... HALLETT: Watch your step, Egan, I guess you know why we're here. EGAN: I haven't the
                  slightest idea. HALLETT: I suppose you don't know that Dan Winterslip was murdered last night. EGAN: So I
                  read in the morning paper. But I still don't know why you're here.


Hallett again urges Egan up the stairs.
HALLETT:   You were the last person to see him alive.  Now stop stalling and come inside.
The four of them mount the stairs.  SCENE 116 INTERIOR REEF AND PALM HOTEL There are two exits in the lobby,
                  which has a picturesque shabbiness.  A beachcomber has slipped in when Egan went out, perhaps to get a glimpse of a newspaper
                  from "home".  When Hallett, John, Egan and Chan enter, the beachcomber makes a hasty silent exit.  Egan indicates
                  chairs and they all seat themselves.

EGAN: I'm certain you'll soon find you're making a big mistake...so if you will just
                  be as brief as possible. I have to get to the dock. CHAN: Last night you telephone Mr. Winterslip. Wished to cancel
                  engagement with him. He insisted upon seeing you. You went to his house some time after eleven as he most urgently requested.
                  Conversation with him was exciting one. Voices were elevated. It is not quite so? EGAN: (Nervously)
Quite.


The men are all seated with their backs to the exits, engrossed in their conversation.  We see the beachcomber move stealthily
                  past the open doorway and glance in as he passes.  Then he moves away.

CHAN: Every fence has two sides. Humbly suggest you tell yours. EGAN: (He
                  takes out a cigarette case and with shaking fingers lights a cigarette) I did make an appointment with Winterslip
                  for last night, but I changed my mind. I telephoned to tell him so but he insisted upon keeping it, so I went shortly after
                  eleven. HALLETT: Who let you in? EGAN: Winterslip was waiting in the garden. We talked there for a while then
                  went inside. We talked a half an hour about...the...er...business that brought me. Then I left and came right home. CHAN:
                  Your clerk... (Waving hand toward desk) ....saw you come in? EGAN: I have no clerk. CHAN:
                  You and Mr. Winterslip were good friends? EGAN: In the twenty-three years I have been here, I never spoke to him until
                  the other morning on the telephone. CHAN: Then you were acquainted with him previous? EGAN: (Hesitantly)
Yes, slightly. So slightly that Winterslip had completely forgotten it. CHAN: But your memory retained it
                  and after twenty-three years you called him on sudden business. EGAN: I did. CHAN: Thank you so much. And
                  now please what was that business? EGAN: I can't tell you. HALLETT: Oh, yes, you can. EGAN:
(Quietly) Never. HALLETT: You'd better come along with me. You'll tell it to the prosecutor.


Now Egan is angry.  He crushes the cigarette he has been smoking in a tray and rises.
EGAN:   Now, look here.  I have told you once, my business with Winterslip was my own.
Calmly Chan leans over and picks up the cigarette stub.  He gazes happily at it, then takes a small box from his pocket, opens
                  it, takes out the stub he found in the garden, comparing them.  SCENE 117 INSERT Two cigarette stubs in Chan's
                  fingers, each bearing the name "Corsican".

CHAN'S VOICE: (Says aloud) "Corsican" and the same cigarette.
                  CHAN: You always smoke these, Mr. Egan? EGAN: (Startled) No. CHAN: They
                  are not for sale here on the Island, Mr. Egan. Please let me see your case.


Egan reluctantly hands over his case.  Chan finds half a dozen of the same brand of cigarettes in the case.  From these he
                  looks inquiringly at Egan.

EGAN: (Nervously) They were given to me. CHAN: Who
                  was generous person, please? EGAN: I'm...I'm afraid I can't tell you that either.


John is viewing the proceedings with superior distaste.
JOHN:  Why not arrest him, Captain Hallett?  It's pretty obvious he's implicated.
Egan turns a glare of intense dislike to John.  Hallett rises.
HALLETT:   Come on, Egan.  EGAN:   If you'll just wait until this afternoon....  HALLETT:   Get your hat.
Egan suddenly becomes a figure which strongly appeals to the sympathy.
EGAN: Gentlemen, if you'll just wait a moment or two. You've done me out of the pleasure
                  of meeting my daughter at the dock. (He glances at the clock above the desk) The 'Matsonia''s been
                  in fifteen minutes and she'll be here in a moment. JOHN: (Annoyed) I say, haven't we wasted
                  enough time already? CHAN: Time only wasted when sprinkling perfume on goat farm.


Now into the scene comes Carlotta Egan, with her suitcase.  John recognizes her as the girl he has met on the ferry and looks
                  on in astonishment as she drops her grip and runs into Egan's arms.

CARLOTTA: Dad! Where were you? You've never missed meeting me be---- (She
                  suddenly becomes aware of the other men and asks slowly) What is the matter? EGAN: I've a little business
                  in the city, Carlotta, dear. If I'm not back soon, you take charge. CARLOTTA: (Nervously) What's
                  happened? HALLETT: I'm sorry, Miss, but your father's being held for questioning in a murder case. Come on, Egan.


Hallett firmly leads Egan away.  Carlotta stands there bewildered.  John steps up to her.
JOHN:   Perhaps I can explain.  I don't suppose you remember me?  CARLOTTA:   Of course I do, the missionary.
She brushes past John, runs to the door and sees:  SCENE 119 FROM CARLOTTA'S ANGLE Egan getting into Hallett's
                  car.  Hallett gets in and the car starts off.  SCENE 120 INTERIOR HOTEL LOBBY - MEDIUM SHOT Carlotta watches
                  the car disappear.  John comes up to her and Carlotta turns quickly to him.

CARLOTTA: What has happened. JOHN: My uncle was murdered. CARLOTTA:
                  Oh! And you blamed my father? JOHN: I'm awfully sorry, but the evidence made it appear.... CARLOTTA:
(Flaring) What evidence? How dare you even think my father could do such a thing! It's too bad you threw
                  away that high hat.


Carlotta is ready to weep with anger and anxiety.  She turns on her heel and leaves.  John looks helplessly after her.  Chan,
                  who has been shrewdly observing this, approaches John, who is looking off in the direction taken by Carlotta.

JOHN:   Perhaps Egan is not guilty, Mr. Chan.  Do you think we've been too hasty?  CHAN:   Perhaps - Hasty accuse,
                  leisurely repent.

Chan and John are going out of the hotel on Chan's speech.   SCENE 121  EXTERIOR REEF AND PALM  John and
                  Chan come to Chan's car - Chan takes big old-fashioned lock off wheel.  They get in.  Again Chan is uncertain as to response
                  of car.  He steps on starter and is gratified with the car's immediate response.  Car starts out.   SCENE 122  CAMERA
                  TRUCKING ALONG BESIDE THE CAR  Chan's expression is blandly noncommittal as they ride.  John looks worried.  Presently
                  he says:

JOHN:   There's something that's been on my mind all along, Mr. Chan.  CHAN:   Humbly suggest....shoot.  JOHN:
                    A strong-box I was bringing to my Uncle Dan from San Francisco was stolen from me on the way over.  You see, it was like
                  this.....

As John starts to tell about the box, CAMERA STOPS, and we see the beachcomber slip from behind palm tree and watch car disappear.
                   FADE OUT AND INTO:  SCENE 123 EXTERIOR DAN'S VERANDA Amos and Minerva are having tea.

AMOS: (Severely) Of course, I'm not in a position to exert
                  any authority but I feel very strongly against it. The idea of a child planning marriage so soon after her father's death
                  is little short of sinful. MINERVA: Well, it seems that Mr. Jennison has to leave for China next week, and will be
                  gone a year. The poor child feels she'll be better off away, forgetting it, than alone here. AMOS: Even so, it's disgraceful.
                  There's such a thing as respect for the dead. MINERVA: (Sighs) There must be, Amos. AMOS:
                  Jennison is showing me Dan's papers tonight. Perhaps I'll find some information of importance. You know, I have never trusted
                  Jennison.


John comes into the scene, tosses his hat on a chair and sits down.
JOHN: Hello. MINERVA: What news. JOHN: They've arrested Egan, but
                  the more I think about it, the less I believe him guilty. MINERVA: It seems to me you're all forgetting the wrist
                  watch. JOHN: So we are! How stupid! AMOS: I don't believe that will help us. (Turns directly
                  to Minerva) That Compton woman I spoke of to you, Minerva. I think the real murderer has something to do with
                  the life Dan led with that woman. MINERVA: (Slowly) There might be some truth in it.


Minerva reaches for her handbag and takes out the brooch holding it up for them to see.
He gave her this a short time ago. Kamaikui found it here the night of the murder.
                  JOHN: (Excitedly) Why didn't you tell Chan about it? MINERVA: (Coldly)
This is not a matter for official prying. I intend to see her myself. JOHN: I think I'd better do that. AMOS:
                  No - I will see her. Give me the brooch.


Chan's voice comes over the scene.
CHAN'S VOICE:   The law is honest man's eyeglass to see better.  Humbly suggest unworthy self as proper person.
They turn as Chan comes into the scene.  He holds his hand out to Minerva, who after a second's hesitation, gives him the
                  brooch.

CHAN:   Thank you so much.  AMOS:   Perhaps you're right.  Let me know what you find out.  CHAN:   Always
                  enjoy to talk when words are important.

Amos exits.  SCENE 124 EXTERIOR DAN'S DRIVEWAY Jennison is getting out of his car.  Barbara is there meeting
                  him - Amos passes them on his way home, and nods curtly.

BARBARA: (Looking after Amos) Uncle Amos has taken a very
                  sudden interest in Dad's affairs. I don't think I like it. JENNISON: I don't think he likes us either. But then what
                  does he like? BARBARA: He's so different from Dad. I sometimes wonder if they were really brothers. JENNISON:
(Tenderly) Barbara, I'm going to do my best to make you forget all this. Promise to help me. BARBARA:
                  You've been wonderful, Harry.


By this time they have arrived at the door of he house and they stop.
JENNISON:   I hope you'll always think so.
He takes her in his arms and kisses her tenderly.  FADE OUT.  FADE IN:  SCENE 125 INTERIOR ARLENE'S
                  BEACH HOUSE Steve is standing over Arlene, berating her.  She is weeping. 

STEVE:   I said you was dumb, and I still say you're dumb.  ARLENE:   Oh, Steve - how can you be so brutal -
There is a knock at the door.
STEVE:   Who is it?  CHAN'S VOICE:   Police Department.
Steve and Arlene exchange a quick, frightened glance.  Steve goes to the door, the CAMERA PANNING with him.  He opens the
                  door, and Chan steps in.  He bows to Arlene.

CHAN:   Mrs. Compton?  ARLENE:   Yes.  CHAN:   Forgive intrusion, please - but I must ask you questions about
                  Mr. Dan Winterslip.

Arlene gives a little moan and puts her handkerchief to her eyes.
You knew him well?
Steve intervenes.
STEVE:   Whyn't you leave her alone?  Can't you see she's all broken up?
Chan turns suavely on him.
CHAN:   Sometimes beneath eyes that weep are teeth that laugh.
Arlene sits up indignantly.    Steve is tough.
STEVE:   What's the idea of cracking wise?  CHAN:   Wisdom is strong lever to pry knowledge loose.  Maybe I have question
                  for you, too -

Under his gaze, Steve drops back a step.
ARLENE:   What do you want to know?  CHAN:   You were Mr. Winterslip's - er - er -
He pauses, searching for a word.
- excuse poor English, please - friend?  ARLENE:   He was my fiancé.  CHAN:   A soft word does not scratch
                  the tongue - His death was big surprise to you?

He bows.  She touches her eyes with the handkerchief and nods.
CHAN (Cont'd): When did you see him last?


Arlene changes her front.  She is defiant.
ARLENE:   How dare you make any insinuations!  I don't know anything about poor Danny's death.  I haven't seen him since last
                  Friday.  CHAN:   You were not there last night?  ARLENE:   No.

Chan extends his open hand, showing her the brooch.
CHAN:   Pardon me, please.
Arlene gives a start as she sees the brooch.
ARLENE:   That's mine - give it to me.
Chan shakes his head and puts the brooch in his pocket.
CHAN:  It now belong to law.  It was found in house of murdered man.
He stares steadily at her.
You were with him on night he was killed.
Arlene changes front.
ARLENE:   Yes, I was - but I had nothing to do with his death.  I went over to return that brooch.  At nine-thirty, I left.
                   That's the truth - you're not going to drag me into this, are you?  CHAN:   Many times ship of reputation wrecked
                  on rock of crime.

Steve snarls at him.
STEVE:   You got nothing on us.  CHAN:   That we shall see.  Time covers and discovers everything.  Meanwhile please
                  not to try leaving Island.  That is official.

He bows and exits.  Steve is worried.
STEVE:  They can't hang it on us - they can't.  ARLENE:   Oh, Steve - I'm frightened.
DISSOLVE TO:  SCENE 126 INTERIOR REEF AND PALM HOTEL Carlotta at desk.  Brade, a Cockney provincial, of about
                  fifty years of age, steps up to the deck and gives Carlotta his door key.  He is carrying a small traveling bag.

CARLOTTA: Good evening, Mr. Brade. BRADE: Even'. Any mail? CARLOTTA:
(Turns, looks at pigeon holes) Nothing. BRADE: I'm leaving for the island of Maui for a few days.
                  But I'm not checkin' out, an' I'd be obliged if no one went into my room while I'm gone. CARLOTTA: Of course not,
                  Mr. Brade.


Brade leaves.  Carlotta, who has been going over some papers, now puts some of them into a drawer of the desk.  Her
                  attention is arrested by something she sees in the drawer.  She quickly picks it up.  SCENE 127 INSERT OF CHECK
                  IN CARLOTTA'S HAND It is for five thousand dollars, payable to James Egan, and signed by Dan Winterslip.  SCENE
                  128 INTERIOR LOBBY Carlotta looking at check first in amazement, and then with a thoughtful frown.  She looks up to
                  see Koahla come into the lobby.  He is carrying a package, wrapped, under his arm, which is actually the strong box.  As Koahla
                  approaches the desk, Carlotta hastily slips the check into the drawer and closes it.

KOAHLA:   Like to see Mr. Brade, please.  CARLOTTA:   I'm sorry, he's just left.  Do you want to leave something for
                  him?  KOAHLA:   Come back.

He moves away quickly, and is about to leave by the front entrance when suddenly he stops, as he sees someone approaching,
                  and hastily leaves by a door leading to the beach.  John Quincy comes in by the main entrance.  He comes to the desk.

JOHN:   Miss Egan.
Carlotta looks up, sees John, and her face becomes set.  John finds it difficult to go on, but is determined.
I...I wish you'd let me explain. (A feeble attempt at a joke) I'm
                  not a missionary.


She just stares at him stonily.  He finds it still more difficult.
Unfortunately I've been put in the position of playing at detective. CARLOTTA:
(Icily) Well, I wish you would pick up your toys and play somewhere else. JOHN: I didn't realize...I
                  mean, I didn't know your father...What I really mean is I don't believe he is guilty. CARLOTTA: (Coldly)
That's very kind of you. You don't know how relieved I am. (Sarcastically) I suppose that
                  now you've changed your mind, he's automatically released. JOHN: No, but I'm going to clear him. CARLOTTA:
(Bitterly) I don't see how you can spend your time around here.


With that, Carlotta turns from John deliberately and starts for the door leading to beach.  John follows.
JOHN: (Earnestly) I just want you to believe me, that's
                  all.


He falls into step with her - as they exit.  SCENE 129 INTERIOR LOBBY Chan enters, finds lobby empty, crosses
                  to desk and looks at register.  SCENE 130 INSERT A portion of register showing name "T.M. Brade"
                  and "Room No. 14".  SCENE 131 INTERIOR LOBBY Chan's eyes begin to travel over desk in search of
                  further information.  SCENE 132 EXTERIOR MOONLIT BEACH - TRUCKING SHOT John and Carlotta.  He has evidently
                  made her listen to him, but she is far from being friendly.

JOHN: So it is simply a question of finding the person who fits the clues. As far
                  as I can see it certainly is not your father. CARLOTTA: (Angrily) Then why don't they release
                  him? JOHN: Well, he admits he was there that night, and he refuses to tell the nature of his business. CARLOTTA:
                  I'm sure he has a good reason. JOHN: But they don't know that.


He turns and takes her hands in his.
Look, isn't there some way I can make you believe that I really want to help you?
Carlotta softens a little.
CARLOTTA: But why should you? JOHN: (Smiling) The
                  hero always helps the maiden in distress. CARLOTTA: And you are the hero? JOHN: You can tell me that - later
                  - Now the important thing is to find some way to clear your father. CARLOTTA: (Slow, struggling with
                  herself as to whether or not to tell) I found a check dated the night of the murder in father's desk, made out
                  by your uncle to him. (Triumphantly) If Mr. Winterslip gave him a check that night, my father certainly
                  intended to cash it. And that would prove difficult under the circumstances. Therefore, it would be to his advantage if Mr.
                  Winterslip were alive! That ought to clear him! JOHN: That sounds reasonable. Will you let me have the check? CARLOTTA:
(Looks at him searchingly as if making up her mind. Finally) Yes. JOHN: (Gratefully)
Thank you.


They turn and start back.  SCENE 133 INTERIOR BRADE'S HOTEL ROOM Chan is there going over Brade's belongings.
                   His luggage is plainly marked "T.M.B., Calcutta".  Chan has found a round tin box filled with cigarettes. 
SCENE 134 INSERT TIN OF CIGARETTES. Chan's fingers select one, turning it so we can see the name "Corsican"
                  written on it. 

CHAN'S VOICE:   "Corsican".
SCENE 135 INTERIOR ROOM Chan adds one of these to the two stubs which he already has of the same brand.  Then he prepares
                  to leave the room, putting things back as he has found them.  SCENE 136 INTERIOR REEF AND PALM LOBBY Cope
                  stands at the desk in the empty lobby.  His manner suggests that he has been there for some moments, tapping bell.  Chan comes
                  into the lobby, goes behind the desk.  We see him place key on #14 rack.  Cope, seeing him, thinks he is the clerk.

COPE:   Where can I find Mr. Egan?
Chan realizes Cope's mistake and is quick to take advantage of it.
CHAN: You are...please? COPE: My name is Cope. CHAN: (Gratified)
Gives me great honor to make your acquaintance. I intend to visit you later. COPE: I'm afraid I haven't the
                  slightest knowledge of who is addressing me. CHAN: Your most insignificant servant, Charles Chan. COPE: What
                  can I do for you, Mr. Chan? CHAN: You can make me most happy by telling me what you did last Monday.


Cope stares at Chan with an expression which might be fear.  Then he becomes indignant.
COPE:   Are you trying to be funny?  CHAN:   Funny as man can be about murder.
Chan takes his badge from his pocket and holds it for Cope to look at it.  SCENE 137 INSERT OF BADGE IN CHAN'S
                  HAND  SCENE 138 INTERIOR LOBBY Cope's attitude changes to one of concern.

CHAN: Beg to repeat question. COPE: (Coldly) I see
                  no reason why I should answer.


He crushes out his cigarette in a tray, and turning on his heel, strides rapidly from the lobby.  Chan immediately picks up
                  the stub.  SCENE 139 INSERT OF CIGARETTE STUB IN CHAN'S FINGERS It also bears the name "Corsican".

CHAN'S VOICE:   "Corsican".
SCENE 140 INTERIOR LOBBY Chan looks after Cope's receding figure and murmurs:
CHAN:   Thank you so much.
He stores the stub with the others.  SCENE 141 EXTERIOR REEF AND PALM MOTEL  TRUCKING SHOT of John and Carlotta
                  coming along the path close to the building.  There is a tangled mass of shrubbery against the building.

CARLOTTA:   You must have thought I was a very dreadful person.  JOHN:   I never thought that - even for a minute.
                   I understood perfectly how you felt.  CARLOTTA:   I'm so upset and worried - and angry, too - because I know that
                  never could my father kill anyone - it's just not in his nature.  JOHN:   I'm sure he didn't do it.  Well, from now
                  on I'm sharing your worries.  CARLOTTA:   But won't you be going back to Boston?  JOHN:  Not until we get
                  your father out of trouble - and not until -

He pauses.  She looks up at him expectantly, unconsciously they start to sway toward one another.   There is a rustle
                  from the bushes. 

SCENE 142  CLOSE SHOT ON SHRUB  It moves as if someone were concealed back of it.   SCENE 143  EXTERIOR
                  REEF AND PALM - MEDIUM SHOT  John quickly dives into the shrubbery and grapples with someone. Carlotta moves back with
                  a startled cry. John drags the fellow into the bright moonlight. It is Koahla. In the native's struggle to free himself, the
                  package is torn and he drops the box. John seizes it. Koahla breaks and runs away. John looks at the box in astonishment.
                    SCENE 144  INSERT OF BOX showing initials "T.M.B".

JOHN'S VOICE: (Excitedly) I've got to see Chan at once.


SCENE 145 EXTERIOR REEF AND PALM John and Carlotta start to run.  SCENE I46 CLOSEUP As revolver in
                  man's hand comes around the trunk of palm tree and two shots are fired.  SCENE 147 SIDE OF HOTEL Carlotta
                  and John are hastening in its shadow, about to turn the corner of the building.  The shots stop momentarily.  Then John, quick
                  as lightning, takes Carlotta's arm and pulls her around the corner.  SCENE 148 AROUND CORNER John has Carlotta
                  in his arms.

JOHN:   You're not hurt?  CARLOTTA:   You!
She takes hold of his arm. He looks down quickly. SCENE 149 INSERT OF JOHN'S
                  ARM Her hands are on it. We see a bullet hole through the coat. SCENE 150 EXTERIOR REEF AND PALM


JOHN: (Strangely exhilarated) Never touched me.


Carlotta sighs in great relief.
CARLOTTA:   Oh - I'm so glad.
She sways a little.  He puts his arm around her.
JOHN:   Steady - I'm all right.  CARLOTTA:   You might have been killed.  JOHN:   Heroes are always shot at
                  - but never hit - because there has to be a happy ending.  Now let's find Chan.

She looks up at him smiling anxiously.
CHAN'S VOICE:   Already found.  You were elected target for recent shot?
Both John and Barbara look up to veranda above.
JOHN:   Chan!
They start up the steps.  SCENE 151 VERANDA, REEF AND PALM Moonlight on ocean and beach in back ground, Chan
                  standing there calmly as they move hastily into scene.

JOHN:   Never mind about the shots.  This is more important.  You remember the box I told you was stolen from me on the boat?
                  

CHAN: Memory serves well. JOHN: (Handing it to him triumphantly)
I took it away from Koahla, but he got away. CARLOTTA: He probably is the one who fired at us. You ought to
                  go after him. CHAN: (Examining the box) Cannot get far. To conceal oneself from law is like
                  trying to hide in bird cage.


John is observing Chan's scrutiny of the box.  It is locked.
JOHN:   I wonder what's in it.  CHAN:   Shall gratify your worthy curiosity.
He takes from his pocket a knife.  Opens one of the blades which is a sharp delicate strip of steel, and picks the lock in
                  an astonishingly short period of time.  Chan looks in box, smiles.

CHAN:   Look!
They look.  SCENE 152 INSERT:  INSIDE OF BOX It is empty.
CHAN'S VOICE:   Empty as Robin's nest in January.
SCENE 153 EXTERIOR VERANDA
JOHN: (Slightly exasperated) Then what could Uncle Dan's
                  urgency have been? CHAN: Mr. Brade very best person to answer that question. CARLOTTA: Mr. Brade? Why, a Mr.
                  Brade is stopping here at the hotel. JOHN: (Excitedly) Let's see him at once. CARLOTTA:
                  Oh! You can't. He's gone away for a few days. JOHN: Where? Can't we go after him? CHAN: Make haste only when
                  withdrawing hand from mouth of tiger. And now, humbly beg to be excused. I have appointment with Honorable Amos Winterslip.


He picks up box and bows.
JOHN: Er, ah, do you need me? CHAN: (Smiles) Humbly
                  suggest you continue along present lines. (This, with ever so slight glance in Carlotta's direction)


As Chan goes down steps, CAMERA PANS to include Chan's Ford in back ground in driveway.
                  He carries the box to the car - unlocks car - gets in and drives away. 


SCENE 154 INTERIOR LOBBY John and Carlotta come to desk.


CARLOTTA:   Oh, you forgot to tell Chan about the check.
She walks behind the deck.  He leans on it.
JOHN: (Smiling) Too many things happening in too short a
                  time. Let me have it - I'll catch him at Uncle Amos'.


She goes to the drawer where she has left the check and starts to open it.  She is arrested by his speech in the act of opening
                  the drawer.

You know, you oughtn't to be here all alone...I mean until your father gets back.
                  Aren't you at all afraid? CARLOTTA: Why, I hadn't even thought about it. JOHN: Well, I have. I think I'll
                  move in. CARLOTTA: (Flustered; yet secretly gratified) Why, I...I wouldn't dream of allowing
                  it, really. JOHN: This is a hotel, isn't it? CARLOTTA: Yes.


John very calmly takes the pen from the holder and writes his name on the register.
JOHN:   With bath, please.
Carlotta looks at him.  She cannot refuse.  Turning to the keyboard, she takes a key from it and hands it across the desk
                  to him.  John looks at the key.

On the ocean side?  CARLOTTA:   Yes, sir.
They look at each other.  Then, she, to hide her embarrassment, opens the drawer to get the check.  SCENE 155 INSERT
                  OF OPEN DRAWER Carlotta's hand comes into the scene stirring the contents in search of the check.  SCENE 156 INTERIOR
                  LOBBY Carlotta suddenly looks up at John in blank amazement.

JOHN:   What's up?  CARLOTTA:   It's gone!  The check is gone!  JOHN:   Gone!
He leans over the desk as if to assure himself that the check is really gone.  He then reaches across the desk with his left
                  hand, taking her hand and pressing it with swift tenderness.

I'll be back.
He crosses to the door, then turns.
JOHN:   Goodbye.  CARLOTTA:   Goodbye.
John goes out. SCENE 157 EXTERIOR REEF AND PALM John comes running down
                  the stairway and hurries along the garden path. DISSOLVE INTO: SCENE 158 ROAD NEAR AMOS' HOUSE Chan's
                  Ford is parked at the roadside. John comes along the road. He sees Chan's Ford and is about to continue on when he hears the
                  crackling of twigs under foot. John stops abruptly, looking in the direction of the noise.


JOHN: (Sharply) Chan? CHAN'S VOICE: (From
                  opposite direction) Here, please.


At the sound of Chan's voice, John again turns his head.  At the same moment, a figure darts out from back of Ford and starts
                  running down the road.  John dashes in pursuit.  SCENE 159 EXTERIOR ROAD NEAR AMOS' FENCE In the moonlight
                  we see Chan stooping over some object on the ground.  He now straightens and takes a step or two toward the CAMERA as if he
                  is trying to locate John.

CHAN: (Calls) John! JOHN'S VOICE: (Muffled)
Coming...


Chan waits anxiously.  In a moment, John appears, dragging the beachcomber.
JOHN:   I found this fellow lurking in the ....
John breaks off abruptly for Chan has moved to one side so that now John can see what was heretofore hidden from him. 
SCENE 160 CLOSE SHOT NEAR FENCE The distorted corpse of Amos lying on the ground.  SCENE 161 ANOTHER
                  ANGLE John is stunned, horrified.

JOHN:   Uncle Amos!
As John moves involuntarily toward the body of Amos, Chan steps close to the beachcomber, seizes his wrist suddenly and holds
                  it up.  SCENE 162 INSERT OF BEACHCOMBER'S WRIST showing the wrist watch with the numeral two obscured.  Over
                  the scene comes John's voice:

JOHN'S VOICE: (Excitedly) That's our man!


FADE OUT.  FADE IN:  SCENE 163 INTERIOR POLICE STATION - DAY Chan is seated at desk, calmly writing
                  on piece of paper.  Hallett is pacing back and forth, very much upset.

HALLETT:   I tell you, Charlie, they're putting the thumbscrews on me.  That Minerva Winterslip woman is raising the roof
                  at the Governor General's mansion.  And if we don't get to the bottom of this right away, it means my stripes and your job.

Chan continues to write without looking up.
CHAN: Cannot hasten. Cat who tries to catch two mice at one time, goes without supper.
                  HALLETT: (Impatiently) I know, I know, Charlie. But the newspapers are on my tail. CHAN:
(Looks up, smiles) Ah, you can portion it out, but cannot receive it, eh?


He continues to write.  SCENE 164 VERY CLOSE SHOT on Chan's hand, writing list of the names of the suspects. 
                  He has already written:

          T.M. Brade           Arlene Compton           Steve Leatherbee           Koahla           James
                  Egan 

Chan writes the name of "Arthur Temple Cope".  SCENE 165 MEDIUM SHOT Jennison is escorted in the
                  office by a uniformed policeman.  Chan looks up.  Hallett nods curtly.

HALLETT:   Yes, Mr. Jennison?  JENNISON:   I am here as the late Mr. Winterslip's attorney to protest against the
                  way your investigation has been handled.  CHAN:   Unworthy officer apologizes for stupidity - very sorry.  JENNISON:
                    Sorry?  You're going to be a lot more than sorry if you don't do something right away.  Do you realize that the 'President
                  Tyler' sails tomorrow morning with most of your suspects on it?  HALLETT:   Sure, we know - what do you want us to
                  do - stop the boat?  JENNISON:   I demand that you make every effort to arrest the guilty person before tomorrow -
                  otherwise I shall register a formal protest with the Governor General.

SCENE 166 WINDOW OF ROOM HIGH UP Through the bars stealthily comes a long narrow tube held in a man's hand.  SCENE
                  167 INTERIOR POLICE STATION Chan rises, the piece of paper in his hand.

CHAN:   If you will please see that these people are at Winterslip house tonight at eight thirty, we shall do our very best.
                   Have plan.

As Chan finishes speaking, he hands the paper to toward Hallett.  A dart flashes into the scene past Chan's head, piercing
                  the paper, and pinning it to the desk.  SCENE 168 INSERT: Quivering dart, stuck in desk through paper. 
BACK TO:  SCENE 169 INTERIOR POLICE STATION The three men look up in direction of window.  There is no
                  one there.

JENNISON: Who was that? CHAN: (Picking up dart) Enough
                  poison on this to bring immediate death to all concerned.


Hallett, who has been stunned with amazement, now turns and rushes from the room.
HALLETT: (Shouting) Flannagan! Hong Foo!


Chan turns to Jennison.
CHAN:   Most strange.  No native ever do anything to Chan - unless hired by someone.
He looks significantly at Jennison.  DISSOLVE TO:  SCENE 170 INTERIOR CHAN'S DINING ROOM The entire
                  family is at dinner.  Chan looks at one of his sons admonishingly.

CHAN: Soup is food, not musical instrument. BOY: Well, then, how about that
                  saxophone you promised me? CHAN: (Grimaces) Of both prefer musical soup.


Chan rises.  The whole family stands up respectfully.  Chan turns to the eldest son on his right.
Oswald.   OSWALD: What's on your mind, Pop? 
CHAN: You have carefully gone over instructions? OSWALD: Everything's Jake.
                  CHAN: (Puzzled) Jake? OSWALD: Okay. CHAN: (Enlightened)
Oh...Okay.


During this, Mrs. Chan has left the room.  She now re-enters, bringing Chan his hat.
MRS. CHAN:   You'll be home early?  CHAN:   Cannot say.  MRS. CHAN:   Good luck.  CHAN:   Luck and
                  help of inscrutable fates extremely necessary.  Tonight decide future.  Tomorrow big detective or lowly laundry man.

As Chan leaves, putting on his hat,  FADE OUT.  FADE IN:  SCENE 171 EXTERIOR DAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT
                  The house is brightly lighted within.  Bars of light sift through the venetian blinds on the veranda.  We can hear the
                  murmur of many voices from the inside.  John and Carlotta come up the garden path and, as they near the door, Carlotta stops.
                   John slips his arm about her protectingly.

JOHN:   Won't you come in?  There's nothing to worry about.
Carlotta holds back nervously.
CARLOTTA:   But you know what happens in cases like these.  All they're interested in, is a conviction.  It doesn't matter
                  to them if the man is innocent as long as they can prove him guilty.  JOHN:   Don't be nervous.  For your father's
                  sake.  He'll feel better if he sees you believe in him.

Carlotta braces herself and manages to smile.  As they go into the house,  DISSOLVE INTO:  SCENE 172 INTERIOR
                  DAN'S LIVING ROOM - CLOSE SHOT AT DOOR John and Carlotta enter, pause, their eyes travelling around the room.  SCENE
                  173 INTERIOR LIVING ROOM - PAN SHOT AROUND ROOM As we pick up each character, the voices of the others are heard,
                  ad lib.  As we reach each individual, we hear what he is saying to the exclusion of the others, whose voices are but indistinctly
                  heard.  CAMERA first PANS on BRADE.

BRADE: (Nervously) Wot's it all about, is wot I want to
                  know.


Brade turns, as he says this, as if he were asking the question of the man next to him.  CAMERA PANS as he turns, revealing
                  Cope.

COPE: (Coldly squelching the man) Perhaps you're right.


Cope turns away, satisfied the man will bother him no more, and looks off. His attention
                  is caught by someone, to whom he nods reassuringly. CAMERA SWINGS TO EGAN, who is answering the look; nervous, pleadingly hopeful in his gaze. CAMERA PANS to Arlene Compton, who turns and speaks, preening herself very much
                  in the manner of an English grand dame.


ARLENE:   Silly bores, these gatherings, what?
CAMERA PANS direction she is looking, revealing Steve, looking at her in open-mouthed astonishment.
STEVE:   WHAT?
CAMERA PANS, passing in succession the beachcomber, Koahla, the three policemen standing at the doors, Hallett and the doctor.
                   CAMERA PANS FARTHER.  MINERVA'S voice is heard just before the Camera picks her up, where she is sitting with Jennison and
                  Barbara.

MINERVA:   This is all poppycock.  The idea of bringing all these people into the house.  The first thing I'll do when I get
                  back to the States is to put this in the hands of the proper authorities, you may be sure.

As she reaches the end of her speech, CAMERA PANS to dining room door, and we see Charlie Chan standing there, having just
                  arrived, listening with calm amusement to her speech.  He has a box under his arm.

CHAN:   Thank you so much.
SCENE 174 INTERIOR LIVING ROOM Chan sees Carlotta and John at door.
CHAN: Please be seated.


He indicates the direction with his hand, and John and Carlota move across the room to
                  sit with Minerva, Jennison and Barbara. Carlotta throws a fleeting smile of cheer in the direction of her father, who tries
                  to smile back. Chan looks over the entire room, searchingly, as he starts to talk, standing in front of table.


CHAN:   You have all, except one, good excuse for much annoyance that I bring you here tonight.  Humbly request patience,
                  for though all are called perhaps only one chosen.....

SCENE 175  CLOSEUP CHAN'S HANDS as he opens the book and lays the exhibits out in orderly fashion on the table.  His voice
                  comes over the scene.

CHAN'S VOICE:   I have before me evidence which show that every person in room saw Dan Winterslip or had reason to see him
                  the night of murder.

SCENE 176 LIVING ROOM Chan pauses, and with a gesture toward the family group, adds:
CHAN: Except these five. (Pause) First I shall prove motive.


SCENE 177 CLOSE SHOT OF BRADE Uneasily he takes out a cigarette and lights it.
CHAN'S VOICE:   Mr. Brade!  
Suddenly into the scene right front of Brade, comes the box.  Brade starts nervously.  CAMERA MOVES BACK far enough to include
                  Chan, who is holding the box.

CHAN: Is this your box? BRADE: I never saw it before in me life. CHAN:
                  These are your initials? BRADE: They were also my father's. CHAN: Humbly suggest you tell what you know of
                  all this. BRADE: I don't know nothing. I came 'ere to 'Awaii to see Dan Winterslip to get by rights what is mine.
                  Dan Winterslip robbed my father when 'e was a mate on my father's ship, thirty-five years ago. When my father died, Winterslip
                  buried 'im in the South Seas, and kept all 'is fortune, South American gold and jewels. I've been a Civil Service worker in
                  India until I was retired. I've been waiting thirty years to save enough money to come 'ere to get what is rightfully mine,
                  but I never 'ad a chance to see 'im. 
 
CHAN: You did not see Dan Winterslip the night of the murder? BRADE: No, I
                  didn't, worse luck. CHAN: You smoke Corsican cigarettes?


Picks up cigarette from desk.
CHAN: One was found on these grounds. It is a brand not sold on the Islands. BRADE:
(Wildly) Well, I don't know nothin' about it. (Suddenly) Yes, I do. (He
                  points off at Egan)


The CAMERA PANS QUICKLY TO EGAN, who looks startled and then PANS BACK to Chan and Brade again.
I gave Egan here a couple.  'E said 'ow 'e was famished for a 'omey fag.  CHAN:   Thank you so much. 
As Chan goes out of the scene, the CAMERA ROLLS UP close on Cope, who is cooly smoking a cigarette.
CHAN'S VOICE: Mr. Cope. COPE: (Suavely) Mr. Chan.
                  CHAN'S VOICE: You smoke Corsican cigarettes, also. COPE: Quite right.


Chan comes into the scene speaking and holding two of the cigarette stubs.
CHAN: A most singular difference, however, is to be noticed from the two brands of
                  Corsican...one extract of Virginian, other of Turkish influence. You favor Virginia. COPE: (Nervously)
What if I do? CHAN: Mr. Brade smokes Turkish. COPE: Well? CHAN: Stub found here that night,
                  Virginian. What were you doing here? COPE: I wasn't here that night. CHAN: Can you prove? COPE: I
                  went to bed early and read. CHAN: Regret such alibis have habit of disappearing like cheese in vicinity of mouse.
                  MINERVA'S VOICE: Cheese and mice, fiddlesticks.


The CAMERA SWINGS to Minerva who sits indignantly erect in her chair.
Captain Cope had tea with me here that afternoon.  CHAN'S VOICE:   Much time saved if honorable lady not so secretive
                  with important information.  MINERVA:   Whom I have tea with is my own affair.

CAMERA SWINGS BACK to Chan and Cope.
CHAN: We are still in most complete fog concerning your business on this Island. COPE:
(Determinedly) Well, sir, if you really must know, I .....


Cope sits straighter in his chair and involuntarily looks off at Egan.  THE CAMERA SWINGS TO EGAN, who quickly and
                  pleadingly shakes his head, then CAMERA SWINGS BACK TO COPE AND CHAN AGAIN as Cope stops abruptly.  Chan, however, has caught
                  the business.

CHAN: Humbly suggest you continue. COPE: (Leaning back in chair)
I have nothing more to say. CHAN: More later. Thank you so much.


As Chan turns from Cope.  SCENE 178 CLOSEUP OF BROOCH in Chan's fingers.   Over the scene comes Arlene Compton's
                  voice.  

ARLENE'S VOICE:   Yeah...that's my brooch all right.
SCENE 179 INTERIOR ROOM As Arlene claims the brooch, Brade rises, comes over and looks at it.
BRADE:   Hers, nothing!  That brooch is part of a set belonging to my family.  There was a necklace and earrings that went
                  with it.

Chan waves him back to his chair.
CHAN:   Kindly wait until asked.
Brade retreats himself and Chan approaches Arlene.  SCENE 180 ARLENE AND STEVE She sees that she is to be
                  the next one.

ARLENE: Now, listen, you Chinese rainmaker, I don't know nothing about.... STEVE:
(Under his breath) Let him do the talking, you dummy.


Chan comes into scene.
CHAN: (Interrupting) Woman's tongue like sword that never
                  gets rusty.


Arlene turns to Chan as if she has suddenly decided to take him into her confidence.
ARLENE: Now I'll tell you everything I know, Mr. Chan, which is nothing. (She
                  draws a long breath) I was here that night but left early. I returned that brooch to him - STEVE: Get
                  wise to yourself, Chan. Why should she kill him? He was worth more to her alive than dead, wasn't he? CHAN: To you
                  also? STEVE: Ah, no cracks from you. (To Arlene) Come on, Babe, I guess we can scram now.


They start up.
CHAN: (Firmly) When I say go.


They hesitate, then resume their seats.  As they do so, Chan turns.
Mr. Egan.
He walks out of the scene.  SCENE 181 MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT ON EGAN He is pathetically apprehensive.  Chan comes
                  to him.  In he hand hanging close to his side, Chan holds the $5,000 check.

CHAN: You still stubbornly determined not to tell us the nature of your business the
                  night you saw Mr. Winterslip? EGAN: (Hesitantly) Yes. CHAN: Perhaps you will explain
                  why Mr. Winterslip gave you this?


He holds up the check.  Egan starts violently, then he flashes a quick look off at Carlotta.  SCENE 182 CLOSE
                  SHOT Carlotta with John on edge of shot.  She is looking anxiously off at her father, hoping he will say something to
                  clear himself.  SCENE 183 EGAN AND CHAN Egan lowers his eyes and makes no reply.

CHAN:   Regret that without adequate explanation will have to hold.  Very often circumstantial evidence carry conviction.
This is said as a veiled threat to urge Egan to speak.  But Egan remains silent.  Chan turns and walks away.    SCENE
                  184 MEDIUM FULL SHOT Chan crosses to table near which Hallett is seated.

CHAN:   Advise that he be taken into custody.  HALLETT:   Right.
He starts for Egan.
CARLOTTA: (Rising quickly) No!


All eyes turn to Carlotta.  She advances to Cope.
Why don't you speak?  Why don't you tell what you know?
She stamps her foot.
You - and your proud family! Well, I haven't got that kind of pride - I haven't any
                  pride where my own are concerned. I'll tell!


Egan jumps up.
EGAN:   Carlotta - please -
She turns to him.
CARLOTTA:   I know all about it, Dad - I've known for years - ever since I found your old diary - it doesn't matter to me
                  - you're my father no matter who you were or what you did - Thirty-five years ago, my father was a teller in a bank in Australia.
                   One day a man walked in with a bag of foreign gold - he cashed it into English pounds.  It was unusual - so much South American
                  gold was rarely seen in those days.  My father wrote the transaction in his diary - and he never forgot the face of the man.
                   He is the only living person who could identify Winterslip as the man who had Brade's gold.

She pauses and looks defiantly around her.  She looks at John pitifully, beseeching him with her eyes.
So when I found he check that Winterslip gave my father - I knew he had blackmailed
                  Winterslip to pay for his silence.


John springs to her.  She holds him off.
I just couldn't tell you before - I didn't want anyone to know -  JOHN:   What difference would it make to me?
Egan lifts his shamed face.
EGAN:   I was going to use the money to send you back to England - to my family -
Carlotta goes to him and puts her arm around him.
CARLOTTA:   I don't want to go to your family - they weren't interested in us before - I'm not interested in them now.
Cope comes to her in a kindly way.
COPE:   My dear, don't judge us too harshly - I came here to take him home.   CHAN:   I beg pardon - you take him
                  home? 

COPE: I am his older brother. 
CHAN: Clues explode in embarrassed face, like loaded cigar. I am expecting.... 
MINERVA: (Interrupts) I can't understand this strange protection
                  of that man. (She points to the beachcomber) And that boy.


She indicates Koahla.  Chan walks over to beachcomber, he has the watch in his hand.
CHAN: You were caught in vicinity of Amos Winterslip's body wearing this on your wrist.
                  It is doubtless fact that same person commit both foul deeds. We know who kill Dan Winterslip wear this. BEACHCOMBER:
(Excitedly) I told you I found it in the water. CHAN: When? BEACHCOMBER: I don't remember....
                  CHAN: More later.


He goes to table and picks up box.  He then goes to Koahla.
CHAN: You! Miserable boy. Speak. If not, rest of your unworthy life will be spent
                  on rock pile. KOAHLA: (Thoroughly frightened) Know nothing of murder. One day see Mr. Winterslip
                  read in paper about Mr. Brade coming to Hawaii. Much excited. I go with him many times to San Francisco house and know of
                  box with Mr. Brade's name in trunk in attic. Ask friend on boat to go there quick and get for me. CHAN: So you could
                  blackmail? (To policeman) Take him away.


Koahla is taken out.
(Turns to Brade) Mr. Brade, you say this belong to your father?
(Shows him the brooch) 
 
BRADE: Yus. CHAN: (With box in other hand) And this
                  too? BRADE: Yus. CHAN: Look!


SCENE 185 CLOSE SHOT OF OPEN BOX in Chan's hand.  Chan presses a hidden spring, and the bottom of the box shoots forward,
                  revealing a narrow secret drawer, in which we see earrings and a necklace of the same peculiar design as the brooch. 
SCENE 186 BACK TO SCENE

BRADE: (Excitedly) That's them, sir. That proves it. CHAN:
                  Precisely. You came here that night to get what rightfully was yours, and when Mr. Winterslip refuse, you ---- BRADE:
(Frightened) No, no, I tell you ----


At this moment a loud commotion is heard just outside.  Everyone keyed up to a high pitch of excitement shows extreme uneasiness.
                   Now we see a struggle in the doorway between three men.  We recognize Chan's two elder sons, each firmly grasping a struggling
                  figure.  SCENE 187 MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT FAMILY GROUP They are watching this struggle tensely.  Suddenly Barbara
                  gasps with astonishment.

BARBARA: Why, that's Mr. Berkeley. JENNISON: (Amazed) Berkeley!
                  MINERVA: (Excitedly) Who is he? JOHN: He was aboard ship with us.


SCENE 188 ANOTHER ANGLE - INTERIOR ROOM Chan stands at the table confronting Berkeley, who is flanked on either side
                  by Chan's sons.

OSWALD:   Okay Pop?  CHAN:   Extremely Jake!  Thank you so much.
The boys drop back, leaving Chan and Berkeley facing each other.  Berkeley is a little breathless and is arranging his disordered
                  tie, etc. 

BERKELEY:   This is an outrage!
SCENE 189 INSERT:  Chan's hand picking up the piece of seaweed from the table.  SCENE 190 INTERIOR ROOM
CHAN: The night of the murder I found this marine vegetation fresh in this house.
                  Also did I observe signs of sea water on the mats. A powerful swimmer could have left the 'President Tyler', come in here,
                  and return to ship. (Dramatically pointing to Berkeley) You murdered Dan and Amos Winterslip!


There is a gasp of amazement from everyone.
BERKELEY:   You'll never get me alive!
He looks around wildly.  Chan takes out a gun.  Berkeley makes a break for the door.  The women scream.
CHAN:   Get him!
Jennison leaps for Berkeley, seizing him from behind, and although much smaller than Berkeley, we see that by a quick maneuver
                  he throws the man on his back.  Berkeley gives a cry of pain.  Chan puts the gun on the table and comes to them quickly.

BERKELEY: (Groaning) My arm.


The doctor hastens over and stoops beside Berkeley, quickly examining his arm.
HALLETT:   Broken.
Chan seizes hold of Jennison.
CHAN: Thank you so much, Mr. Jennison. I accuse you of the murders of Dan and Amos
                  Winterslip. JENNISON: (Faltering) Why, you...you're crazy. CHAN: (Facing
                  the room) Mr. Berkeley is a Federal Agent here on business. He has heroically offered to play part for me. BARBARA:
(Cries) Oh no, it can't be Harry. CHAN: (To Barbara) When on ship you sent
                  wireless to your father, announcing intention to marry? BARBARA: Yes. CHAN: But you did not see reply your
                  father sent to Mr. Jennison? BARBARA: No. CHAN: (Takes copy from pocket) Cable office
                  graciously supply copy of same.


He hands the wire to her.  She reads.  SCENE 191 INSERT:  WIRELESS IN BARBARA'S HANDS It reads: 
          "HARRY JENNISON            ABOARD S.S. PRESIDENT TYLER             Manage to break your engagement
                             with Barbara or will completely            disinherit her.   If not will expose            you, regardless
                  of damage to me.                                                DAN"

SCENE 192 BACK TO SCENE
BARBARA: (Breaks down) I don't believe it. CHAN:
(To Jennison) It was not difficult to discover your record as champion swimmer and student of dishonorable
                  Jiu Jitsu. JENNISON: This is ridiculous, I tell you. CHAN: Not so ridiculous - because you kill Mr. Amos fearing
                  he expose you when he go over papers. Also, we find native you hired to blow dart in police station. MINERVA: Fantastic!
                  What about the wrist watch?


During this, two policemen have come into scene and stand on either side of Jennison.  Chan goes to the table, puts his gun
                  down, and picks up the watch, which is square in shape.  He comes back to Jennison and lifting his arm, pushes back his cuff.
                   SCENE 193 CLOSEUP OF JENNISON'S WRIST wearing a large round wrist watch.

CHAN'S VOICE:   Officer, kindly remove.
The hands of the policeman come into the shot, and the wrist watch is taken off.
CHAN'S VOICE:   You will notice that although this man wears  round wrist watch, sunburned impression is square, fitting this
                  watch.

During this speech Chan suits his action to his words.  We see his fingers fitting the square wrist watch over the space where
                  it has formerly rested, and where it fits exactly.  SCENE 194 MEDIUM SHOT

CHAN:   Losing wrist watch most untimely.
Jennison looks quickly in direction of Barbara, who looks at him, gives a low cry and collapses.  Minerva hastens to her.
                   Chan also bends down to Barbara.

CHAN:   Am most sorrowful for you.  Sometimes sad world.  Baby cries when born, and often life proves baby right.
Jennison, taking advantage of this unexpected event, sees the revolver Chan has placed on table.  He dives for it, turns and
                  holds the room at bay.  Everyone shrinks back, but Chan, who walks calmly toward him.

JENNISON:   Stand back, or I'll shoot!
Chan continues to walk toward him.  Jennison, desperate, pulls the trigger.  There is a click, nothing more.
CHAN: (Smiles grimly) Empty gun can only kill guilty man.
                  HALLETT: Take him away, boys.


Chan turns to assemblage.
CHAN:   Thank you, so much.
DISSOLVE TO:  SCENE 195 INTERIOR CHAN'S HOUSE -- NIGHT In front of house stands a brand new Ford touring car.
                   Suddenly from within comes a commotion.  The front door opens, and out streams Chan's entire family, shouting gleefully,
                  and piling into the car.  The youngsters fight for the front seat with Chan, ad libbing.... "I want to sit with Pop"
                  --"He promised me", etc.  Mrs. Chan comes into scene with the youngest, followed by Chan beaming happily.  Mrs.
                  Chan takes the front seat without a word.  Chan looks at his wife.

CHAN:   Inscrutable fates prompt Miss Minerva Winterslip to this unexpected generous reward of new car for humble services.
                   We will now proceed to attest its efficiency.

Car drives off.  DISSOLVE INTO:  SCENE 196 EXTERIOR DAN'S GARDEN Near wall.  Carlotta and John.
JOHN:   We could live in San Francisco.  CARLOTTA:   But I think I'd like Boston.
SCENE 197 GARDEN OTHER ANGLE Near driveway. Chan's Ford rolls into scene. Car
                  stops and Chan looks off and indicates to others what he sees.


SCENE 198 The shadows of John and Carlotta are seen merging in an embrace.


CHAN'S VOICE:   Observe happy phenomenon.
SCENE 199 BACK TO SCENE OF CHAN
MRS. CHAN:   Yes - two lovers in moonlight cast only one shadow.
Chan looks at her, then at all his children.
CHAN:   Yes - one shadow now -- many shadows later.
Then he tries starter fearfully, it responds immediately, much to his satisfaction, and car drives away as we  FADE
                  OUT.
