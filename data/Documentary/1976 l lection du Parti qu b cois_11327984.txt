QUEBECOIS!

From the day Canadian crime became organized, the perres
(mobs) ruled Montreal, and Montreal ruled Canada.

Emigrating from Marseilles ‘and Corsica in the early 1900's, .
French gangsters soon made Montreal the center for all smug-
gling operations into the United States. In the 29's they

ran whiskey across the Maine and Vermont borders, in the 30's
deported Mafiosi, in the 40's black market meat and sugar, in
the 50'S heroin and in the 60's gold bars and coins.

In 1952, at the instigation of then New York don Frank Costello,
the American underworld began its move into Montreal Seeking
to control the pégres' smuggling and gambling operations, the
Italian-Americans took over the Italian community on Moritreal's
South Shore and set up headquarters in the center of the city.
Shortly thereafter, New York Jewish mobsters starting muscling
in on the West Side clubs and bars.

Throughout the next two decades, the Americans succeeded in
dismantling, incorporating or destroying the French pégres one
by one. Thoge which survived were forced to move block by
block into th®~slum-ridden North and East sides of Montreal.

This is the story of the final days of the Gaulois Family, the
last great French-Canadian pégre of Montreal.

1 EXT. MONTREAL - NIGHT
Title reads: "Christmas 1971"

“A light snow had been falling all day on the St-Michel
District, and by nightfall a thin sheet of white stretched
across the streets cf northeast Montreal.

The cheerless neon lights of the Bouchern Taverne and Le
Marche St-Michel shone through the cold night air. The
last bastions of hospitality: a neighborhood bar and alli-~
night liquor stcre. A long black Citroen stood in front
of the liquor store,

INSIDE THE LIQUOR STORE, a large old man wrapped in a
blanket-like black overcoat stood at the counter, A
younger man in a biack overcoat, his BODYGUARD, stood
several steps to his left, The younger man nervousiy
clasped his thickly-gloved hands together.

(CONTINUED }
—

The STOREKEEPER anxiously waited on the old man's every
breath. This was no time to make a mistake; he knew
who the oid man was.

So did everyone else in Montreal -- everyone, that is,
who ever placed a bet, required a quick loan, went to
an after-hours club or needed a fix. The old man was
BAPTISTE GAULOIS, the scion of the Gaulois Family, the
last of the kingpins of the French-Canadian underworld.

The old man mumbled something and the Storekeeper
hastened to retrieve a bottle of Napoleon Brandy from
the shelf, The Bodyguard, ill at ease, looked nervously
from side to side.

Baptiste paid the Storekeeper and picked up the bagged
bottle of brandy. The. Storekeeper, nodding, spoke in
hushed tones of great respect:

STOREKEEPER .
Merci, Monsieur Gaulois. Merci.
Au revoir.

Baptiste nodded and walked toward the door. His Body-
guard preceded him.

The Bodyguard was already standing on the snowy sidewalk
when Baptiste's eye caught the magazine rack. He
motioned ahead, but it was too late -- the Bodyguard was

- out in the cold.

Baptiste picked up the tasteful large format copy of
Elle and carried it back to the counter. Dropping a
coin on the counter, the old man tucked the magazine
and bottle under his arm and headed toward the door.
Approaching the door, he braced himself against the

winter night.

 

Baptiste stood OUTSIDE a moment, looked toward his black
Citroen, and was shuffling toward it when he noticed
something unusual --~ his young Bodyguard was lying in
the snow beside the Citroen, his throat slit from ear to
ear. .

Baptiste dropped his magazine and bottle (with a MUTED
CRASH), and fumbled inside his bulky overcoat for a gun.

But it was too late. TWO THUCS, dressed in black from
head to toe, Jumped from the shadows and began to pummel
him with blackjacks.-

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED; (2)

The old man struggled vainly to protect himself as he
sunk to his knees under the steady barrage of blows.
The Thugs paused a moment, as if for decency, and then
the old man's head thudded against tne snowy sidewalk.

The Thugs dragged Baptiste's heavy body across the side-
walk into the Junk-strewn lot next to the market.
Opening his overcoat, they went through his pockets,
removing whatever valuables they could find.

Pocketing Baptiste's wallet, the first Thug reached
into the shadows and pulled out a gasoline can. He
quickly doused the old man's limp body with gasoline.

Pausing only a moment for reflection, the Thug stepped
back, lit a match and tossed it toward the black lumpy
mass. Pouf! The mass erupted in flames, and the Thugs
ran off. .

There was a pause, interrupted only by the SOUND of a
CAR starting up and accelerating away, then the burning
heap began miraculously to move. Baptiste Gaulois rose
Slowly to his feet.

He moved like a pillar of fire through the dark street,
struggling step by agonizing step across the sidewalk
and roadway. Each step took the tortured giant old man
a step closer to the lights of the Boucherne Taverne.

His fiery outline could be SEEN from a block away. The
red and yellow flames leaped from nis body, licking up

the snowflakes before they fell, casting flickering and
grotesque shadows across the snow, :

With a last superhuman effort, Baptiste crashed througn
the swinging door of the Boucherne Taverne.

INSIDE THE TAVERN, a motley crowd of French-Canadian
drunks and workers bolted back in horror as they saw 2
pillar of fire standing before them. They were too
shocked to speak; the room was frozen still.

Baptiste Gaulois, his voice croaking with pain, scream

" BAPTISTE

“CIN, NAPOLEON ROOM - DAY ot

For the last one hundred years the Gaulois Family's |
lavish mansion had stood atop Nt-Royal overlooking

metropolitan Montreal, the docks, the St-Lawrence River,
and, in the distance, the grassy fields of St-Hubert. -

The Gaulois chateau, like most of Montreal's great
monuments, had been built in the 19th Century in the
style of the 1léth Century. Although Montreal had been
a thriving city in the 1760's, it was both too poor and
fire-prone to build monuments rivaling those of the
French monarchs. So it waited a century.

The Napoleon Room, appropriately named, was decorated in
the stvle of the Empire Period. The massive mahegany
Walls were embellished with elaborate gilt bronzes and
red velvet curtains. Gilded eagles, sphinxes and winged
lions (all favorites of Napoleon) peered down from their
nests in the ceiling. :

Once a formal bedroom, the Napoleon Room had been trans-
formed into a makeshift hospital suite. In the center

of the room stood a gigantic red Empire Swan Bed surrounded
by anachronistically modern medical equipment: soft fluores+
cent lights, heart and pulse monitoring devices, stainless
steel tables and glistening instruments.

On the bed lay Baptiste Gaulois, his body and face swathed
in white bandeges. Pillows had. been placed under his head
so that he might have a view of the room -~ if he were
conscious, that is. A doctor (MICHEL) and NURSE stood at
his bedside,

Behind the bed stood a bank of flowers bearing condolatory
messages.

Were Baptiste conscious, he would have enjoyed the view.
For around his bed, in a horseshoe formation, stood the
hierarchy of the Gaulois Family at a respectable distance.
The women were dressed in black, the men wore their
customary dark business suits.

- They patiently awaited their turn to go forward, one by

one, and pay their respects to the ailing Baptiste.

EXT. RESTAURANT PARKING LOT - DAY

While his relatives knelt at his father's bedside,
JEAN-LOUIS GAULOIS, 36, sat calmly in the front seat of
a beat-up van parked outside a plush midtown restaurant.

Beside Jean-Louis sat TI-PIERRE and MARC, two young
Soldiers in the Gaulois Clan. All three men were
Gressed in the "radical" style of the period: faded
jeans, boots, work shirts and jean jackets.

Sharing the rear~view mirror, Ti-Pierre and Mare care-
fully put on their long hippie wigs and mustaches.
Ti-Féeerre, adding a last tonsorial touch, looked to
Jean-Louis for his approval, but Jean-Louis! mind was
elsewhere.

rackets, truck hijacking and the
docks before he found his true
calling as a hit man. Considered
a hothead by the older members of
the family, he was sometimes called
"Le Factieux,' The Troublemaker.

Jean-Louis looked up and his eyes sharpened. Across
the street, REMI LANGLOIS, Montreal Chief of Police,
got out of his squad car and walked into the restaurant
followed by a uniformed officer.

Jean-Louis held up his Colt Commander .45 automatic,
examined it and placed a clip into the handle. Follow-
ing his cue, Ti-Pierre.and Mare likewise check their
revolvers.

‘
Pausing a moment, Jean-Louis turned and nedded to his
accomplices. Ti-Pierre and Mare slipped out of the
van and headed toward the rear door of the restaurant.

Langlois was barely unzipped when he heard the SOUND of
both stall DOORS OPENING simultaneously. He turned to
see two young revolutionaries walking toward him, guns
drawn.

Reno's expression then, as always, looked as if he
were being caught in a vise. Growing up as an
adopted foreigner, James Reno always felt he was on
trial, locked in a vise designed especially for him.
And after Baptiste's death, he knew that vise would
only grow tighter. :

Reno was pensive for a moment, but when he spoke it
was in his usual business monotone, as if nothing
unusual had happened:

RENO
Where's Jean-Louis? Have you
seen him?

CHARLES

No, boss. He ain't been around
all morning.

Michel, the Gaulois family doctor, walked into the
antechamber. “Reno motioned to him:

Michel patiently stepped to the side as Reno turned
back to Charles to finish their convérsation,

Reno was insulted and hurt that Michel would even think
he cared sc little about his father. His face grew
hard and tense:

RENO
You don't have to tell me who I'm
talking about, if you mean that
old burnt-up piece of French toast
in the other room. That old man ‘
was my whole life. He gave me a
family, he gave me a country, he
made me, and I wish to God I could
be lying in his bed now. But I'm
not, and we've got to continue.

Michel was sufficiently cowed for Reno to continue:

Maybe a day or two. More likely.
never. He's awfully sedated now

Cc. * Like a machine stripping gears, Reno's mind Slipped back
an into the memory of something that had happened thirty-

five years before. Reno's mind had been doing this more
and more lately, ever since Baptiste's accident. Most
often they were recollections he hadn't thought of for
many, many years, memories he thought had died decades

. before. .

Reno was about Seven; it must have been the middle Thirties,
He was playing with several of his childhood companions in
the CORRIDOR, a room that looked then exactly as it did now.
His mother walked down the corridor toward him:

GINETTE (age 30)
Jimmy, where is Jean-Louis?

Jimmy and his companions shrugged in unison,

Ginette hastened to the chute and looked down it. There
She siw, one floor below, Jean-Louis, 3 years old, lying

Reno's recollection was interrupted by the SOUND of
Michel's voice. Standing in his wrinkled white coat,
Michel spoke wearily to the assembled family:

He has control only over his right
hand. He will move it up and down...

Baptiste's head was propped up so that he might see his

a superhuman effort to appear stern and paternal.

Baptiste moved his hand up and down. ae

Can you tell us anything?

The old man struggled to raise his head but Michel re-
strained him. Sinking back to his pillow, he emitted
painful sounds. :

Baptiste moved his hand in a circular pattern. Michel
bent his ear to Baptiste's lips.

Baptiste struggled to get up but Michel again restrained
him. He attempted to speak; Michel bent near.

MICHEL
He wants pen and paper.

Alain quickly located a pen and tablet and brought it to
Michel. Michel placed the pen in Baptiste's hand and
held the tablet to it.

With great effort, Baptiste etched a few letters on the
tablet. Michel looked at the tablet and passed it on to
the others.

When Reno looked at the tablet he saw there the iil-formed
letters reading, "RENO."

Reno turned to Jean-Louis:

: RENO
Get Pather Géricault. Immediately.

Jean-Louis hastened out as the Gauloises settled back.

A short time later, Jean-Louis walked in with FATHER
GERICAULT. The room had been prepared for the sacrament.
A small table covered with a white cloth had been placed
near the bed. On it had been placed a crucifix, a lighted
candle, cotton-wool divided into six parts, ‘read, lustral
water and a sprinkler.

Wearing a cassock, supplice and violet stole, and bearing
the Oil cf the Sick, Father Gericault walked toward
Baptiste's bed. As he entered the room, he said:

GERICAULT
Pax huit domui.

Standing, the Gaulois family replied:

FAMILY
(in unison)
Et omnibus habitantibus in ea.

Father Géricault laid the stock of holy oil on the table,
gave Baptiste the crucifix to kiss and began the sacrament
saying: :

GERICAULT
Asperges me, Domine, hyssopo,
et mundabor.

As he did so, Michel prepared a strong dose of morphine te
inject into the old man the moment the sacrament was come
pleted. Standing directly behind Father Gericault, Michel
slowly drew back the plunger of his hypodermic needle.

INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

“While Baptiste Gaulois received the last sacrament, NICK

CONTRINI was walking through his half darkened, cavernous
St-Henri warehouse with Inspecteur de Police Remi Langlois.
Nick Contrini was a fiftyish American mafioso who haa ~
developed his personality watching gangster movies,

‘Granted, he had tried to purchase all the accoutrements

of culture -- $300 suits, limousines, diamond rings --

with his ill-sctten gains, but they had never quite grafted
onto his personality. In the end, he was just an expen-
sively dressed aging thug.

Several steps behind Contrini walked STEPHANO, 35, his
righthand man and bodyguard.

Contrint and Langlois were walking past a long row of juke
boxes as they talked. Contrini had a hand full of dimes,
and every time he passed a box he dropped a dime in and
played a song at random. In between selections he swigged
from the can of Budweiser in his other hand«

LANGLOIS
The whole country is in a panic.
The War Measures Act has been
invoked. These Separatist kooks
got everybody running crazy. Nobody
knows if Cross is dead or-alive.
It's just our turn.

Contrini pushed a juke selection; a French-Canadian. version
of an American rock song came on.

CONTRINI

(to Stephano)
Just our turn? He says it's just
our turn.

(to Langlois)
Remi, when New York calls up
Buffalo and the Big Nan in Buffalo
calls me up and asks where the
forty kilos we were supposed to
deliver are, what should I do?
ive him a history of the radical
movement in Montreal?

back. Run all those bastards in.
Put the heat on. They're easier
to handle in jail.

LANGLOIS
But we've already thrown everybody
in jail who ever wrote an article
or sang a song.

* CONTRINI
While you're doing it, I want you s+
to throw somebody else in.

out of action for a while. You
can do that, can't you?

LANGLOIS
I can run anybody in as long as

INE. LOUIS XIV ROOM = DAZ

The Louis XIV Room iived up to its name. From the moment
one stepped into the great hali he felt he were being
enveloped by the past.

Every table, commode and console was weighted down with
ornate rocaiile gilt bronzes. The high walls were inlaid
with broiseries (paneling) with foliate borders and large
carved framed mirrors. A full-length oi] portrait of
Louis XIV hung on the far wall. A blue woven carpet with
a fleur-de-iys design covered the floor, and crystal
chandeliers hung from the ceiling on golden chains.

If it were not for the somber men in black suits sitting
around the long table, one might have thought he were in
Versailles itself.

Approximately ten men were seated around the long carved
mahogany table. James. Reno, Jean Gaulois, Jacques Gircux
and Alain Giroux sat at the far end; the other men were of
lesser importance. . ‘

Jean Gaulois: stood to speak:

i

JEAN
Baptiste is near death. He's
selected James Reno to assume
control. I assume that is all
right with everyone here.

Jean called off the names of the second echélon clan members.

Réne, Roger, Georges?

Each in turn silently assented.

There was a sad most nostalgic tone in his voice: -

RENO
The Gauloises have always been a
Breat Canadien family; we're perhaps
the last Canadien family. The wops,
the yanks, the yids are all trying
to squeeze us out, This is a family
struggle, it's a racial struggle.

The reason I can't succeed Baptiste
is simple. You all know it. You're
just too polite to mention it. I am
not Corsican. I am not French. I
am not Canadien. I am not Québecois.
I am not Gaulcis. I am American.

He ‘spit from the side of his:mouth at the word “American.”

the Gauloises fall into the hands
of an American.

since I was as high as this table
I was brought up to be a faithful
soldier, and that is all I want to

Reno, his suit wrinkled, walked in measured steps down

into the Napoleon Room where Baptiste lie.

FLASHBACK

Reno must have been nine then, Jean-Louis was about five.
The rain had driven them inside and they were playing in
the LOUIS XIV ROOM.

Reno had cut up cardboard boxes and milk cartons, tying
them to his torso, arms and legs. A stick in his hand,
Reno strutted toward his brother like a robot.

Catching up with his younger brother, Reno began vo pumnel
him ruthlessly with the stick and his fist. Jean-Louis
was soon lying on the floor, crying and screaming for help.

JEAN-LOUIS (age 5)
Mommy! Daddy! Mommy! Daddy!

Baptiste, wearing a wide lapel Thirties suit, strode into
the Louis XIV Room. He was distracted by business, but
not distracted enough to neglect his sons.

close, :

Baptiste continued to protest. ‘Reno's voice cracked
with emotion as he fell to his knees at his father's
bedside: :

RENO
Please, father, I cannot live
without your favor.

Summoning his remaining strength, Baptiste again shook
his hand from side to side.

In desperation, Reno took his father's hand and physically
halted his father's protests. Like Esau to Issac, he
pleaded on:

RENO
No, Papa. I demand your blessing.

EXT. ST-VINCENT COMPOUND = DAY

An unsorted collection of revolutionaries, newspapermen,
professors, intellectuals, common criminals and just plein
scared citizens sat in the open air compound of St-Vincent
de Paul Penitentiary. They didn't seem to have any super-
vision or purpose; some wore only partial uniforms (a
shortage due to a sharp rise in the prison population).
Most were involved in the self-absorbtive tasks which

make confinement tolerable: cleaning fingernails, drawing
patterns in the dust and so forth.

Paul Sauvage, deeply involved in a discussion, sat at the
head of the row; the middle of the row was occupied by a
series of more dispirited and nonconformist types; and at
the end of the row, alone, sat a thirtiesh French gangster,
pissed off as much by the fact that he had te associate
with such ragamuffin good-for-nothings as by the fact he
was in prison.

Jean-Louis looked disdainfully from side to side, then
back at his shoelaces.

The motley line of prisoners routinely filed toward their
cells. Paul Sauvage, standing toward the end of the Line,
whispered something to Jean-Louis, who stood ahead of hin.
Jean-Louis nodded and shuffled forward.

When Jean-Louis reached the door, the GUARD stretched his
arm across the opening, indicating that he should take the
adjoining corridor. Jean-Louis turned and trod toward it.
He was followed by Sauvage and three burly prisoners.

IN THE ADJOINING CELL BLOCK, Jean-Louis trudged rotely

opposite end.

into his crotch and pulled out a long home-made knife,

an act which evoked appreciative "Ohs" and "Ahs" from
the eager spectators.

The Second Fag slipped a hand~fashioned club from under
his shirt. The Third pulled another knife.

Fear crossed Paul's face like a dark cloud:

approached the end of the corridor.

The Fags closed in, Sauvage, panicking, made a dash for

Jean-Louis swung his body back and with a quick thrust
kicked the eyes of the First Fag with both feet. The
Fag screamed, falling back, blood coming from his eyes.

Sauvage, remembering what Jean-Louis had said, turned
around and ran down the center of the corridor, throwing
a flying tackle at the ankles of the Second Fag. The
Fag clubbed Sauvage across the back as he fell.

Pulling the blade from his teeth, Jean-Louis fell upon
the Second Fag yelling:

. JEAN-LOUIS
Pan! Pan! Pan! Pan!

And stabbed him in the lower throat,

Nearby prisoners reached frantically through the bars,
clutching at Sauvage's arms and legs. He had to struggle
to free his foot from a long skinny hand.

Jean-Louis pulled his blade from the dead man's throat
and looked up at the Third Fag who was slowly retreating
backwards, knife in hand.

Jean-Louis stalked him while the prisoners yelled obscene
encouragement to both parties.

JEAN-LOUIS
Etes vous tapette? Non, vous etes
assassin, Vous etes morte,

The Third Fag hardly had a chance. In two quick false
moves Jean-Louis set him up, and with the third he dumped
in and sliced open his beily. Holding his busted gut,
the Third Fag fell to the floor.

Jean-Louis, his shirt splattered with blood, walked back
toward Sauvage. The cell block quieted down. Noticing
the First Fag's knife, Jean-Louis bent down and picked it
up.

Black Prisoner:

All right, 'brother,' let's have
your shirt or I'll cut you.

The two prisoners quickly stripped off their shirts and
handed them to Jean-Louis. He wiped his torso with his
old shirt, grimacing when he came to the place where he'd
been slightly cut by the Third Fag.

JEAN-LOUIS

all prisoners)
Anybody says anything, I'll kill him.

Jean-Louis selected the best knife for himself, wiped it
clean and tucked it into his waistband. Jean-Louis put
on one of the clean shirts and handed the other to
Sauvage. Catching on, Sauvage exchanged his bloody shirt
for a clean one. :

ON TELEVISION, Radio-Canadien was broadcasting a late-.
night news report of. the FLQ trials. WUirsute Separatist
radicals were being led out of the courtroom in Rand=
cuffs. Those who could raised their fists in defiance
for the TV cameraman. The broadcast was in French, but
the message was clear in every language.

Reno, wearing pajama bottoms, walked out of the bathroom
with a towel around his neck.

It never ends. It's too profitable
for everyone.

Reno watched the TV screen as he spoxe:

RENO
The Mafia lets the petit-pégres
sell hot guns to the radicals,
the FLQ turns around and snatches
the Mafia's government connection,
the police kill the connection for
the Mafia and blame it on the
Separatists. The government is
reelected by a landslide, the FLQ
gets a new cause and new martyrs,
and the Mafia does peak business
because all the cops are out
beating up the radicals.

musicians' feet. The musicians started tuning up.

Jean-Louis selected a prominent table, set Suzanne an
Francoise down and called for drinks. Reno, the Bar-
tender and Ti-Pierre brought over glasses and several
bottles of liquor and mixer.

It took the booze-addled patrons a moment to catch on,
but as soon as fresh drinks started appearing before
them they joined in, shouting things like, "Merci,"
and "Here's to ya, buddy."

On stage was one of the French-Canadian Country and
Western groups popular throughout Quebec. ‘hese Caw
singers, lixe Levis Bouliane, Willie Lamothe, Rheal

about the “belles praries" of Saskatchewan and Alberta.

  

"Mon seul amour c'est toi," sang the lead singer as he
laid into his fiddle. As soon as his bow hit the strings,
the room came alive as if touched by an electric wire.

A few patrons had already found their way to the dance
floor. Gulping down their drinks, Reno, Francoise,
