FADE IN:
A SERIES OF IMAGES AND SOUNDS (INT.HOSPITAL 0.R.)

emerge from the darkness: A blast of light like an
interrogation room, the flatline BEEP of an EKG machine. A
NURSE straddles a MAN, unconscious on the gurney. She pumps
his chest with all her might, her hair falling loose from
the red bandana that holds it in place.

MEDICAL PERSONNEL

Swarm around the gurney. Faces covered, dressed in scrub
suits, they look like green androids..A moment later, the
SURGEON makes his entrance like-Caesar. Tufts of black hair
poke through his V-neck surgical suit. NURSES and AIDS jump
to his every request. He pulls the nurse from the patient's

chest.

Voiced=over dialogue is couriterpoint to the scene. It fades
in first as two women LAUGHING...The first to speak SOUNDS

distinctly Afro-American, South Boston.

WOMAN #1 (V.0.)
George W. and Dick Cheney jump out
of a plane. Who hits the ground first?

'
WOMAN #2 (V.0.)
I dunno. Who?

WOMAN #1 (V.0O.)
Who cares?

Afro-American hands pass a syringe to the surgeon who
administers the lidocaine to the dying man. Nothing. Still a
flatliner. The nurse in the bandana hands two paddles to the
Surgeon. The paddles are placed on the man's chest. A beat.
The man's chest arcs and falls. The American eagle tatooed
on his flabby white bicep wiggles helplessiy.

WOMAN #2 (V.0O.)
Okay, why do polish dogs have pug
noses?

WOMAN #1 (V.0.)
Why? :

WOMAN #2 (V.0.)
From chasing parked cars.

The surgeon rips the man's chest armpit to armpit. Someone
hands him a spreader. The surgeon places the instrument over
the ribs and cranks open the chest exposing the shrunken
blue-grey heart. The surgeon shoves his hands into the chest
and begins to massage the tiny, broken organ.
 

 

. WOMAN #1 (V.0.)
What's brown and'white and looks
good on a lawyer?

WOMAN #2 (V.0.)
What?

WOMAN #1 (V.0.)
A pit bull.

The flatline never changes. After a few beats, the surgeon
removes his hand from the chest, walks away briskly. The

rest of the personnel follow except for the nurse in the
bandana. She stares at the room which looks like Beirut after

a bombing. Pulling the spreader from the man's chest, the
nurse gently covers him as she would an ailing child. Alone,

she begins to clean up the mess.

WOMAN #1 (V.0.) (CONT'D)
You know how to save a doctor from

drowning?

WOMAN #2 (V.0.)
No.

WOMAN #1 (V.0.)
Good.

EXT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM REAR ENTRANCE - NIGHT

Two of the nurses just seen are the women we've heard telling
jokes. The Afro-American’ nurse (WINNIE) is lean, dark, "50."s,
The nurse in the red bandana is DENISE, early "30"s,
exceptionally pretty but with eyes fresh with disappointment,
and an attitude tinged with sarcasm. She looks as if she

just figured out that life is a great cosmic joke with a bad
punch line. The last name on her name tag reads DEFIORE
(pronounced De-fury). It fits. The women scan the back street

for someone.
DENISE

Where the hell are they? Okay, why
do hummingbirds hum?

WINNIE
Why?
DENISE
They don't know the words.

WINNIE
That's a sorry ass joke, Denise.

(OOS |

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

DENISE
Gimme a break here. What's the ETA
on those bozos?

WINNIE
Fifteen minutes.

SOUNDS of a quickly approaching vehicle. Headlights splash
the dock. A siren SOUNDS. We think it's an ambulance. It's
a pizza delivery truck. Dialogue overlaps.

DENISE
A siren. What an asshole.

* -WINNIE
It's about time.

The driver of the pizza truck hops out with a large box.

PIZZA DRIVER
Siren's a tease. Just for you.

WINNIE
You ‘bout as funny as a crutch.
(examines the pizza)
Double sausage, bacon, extra cheese.

In the b.g. a real ambulance is HEARD.

DENISE
Oh shit.

WINNIE
Wait. Maybe it's goin' uptown.

The ambulance SOUNDS again. Much closer. Another NURSE appears
at the double doors.

ANOTHER NURSE
Hey campers, we got a black male,
shotgun to the gut.

WINNIE
Damn. You know the other night I had
five gunshot wounds, three
stabbings...

DENISE
---and a partridge in a pear tree.

A fresh-faced, nervous INTERN steps onto a dock.
~ WINNIE

(sotto)
Is he old enough to shave?

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

DENISE
He's not even old enough to fuck.

Winnie laughs out loud, snorts. The ambulance SCREAMS around
the corner stops on a dime at the back of the loading dock,

a Boston police car on its tail. Paramedics pull the bleeding
MAN from the ambulance, his stomach blown open by a double-
barrel blast....we HEAR..."BP eighty over forty... pulse one-~
forty as the gurney pushes inside the hospital.

INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR

It's suddenly, weirdly silent except for the gurney wheels
squeaking wildly over the tile floor. Denise, Winnie, the
paramedic and even the cops exchange looks, wait for the
intern to bark orders.

DENISE
(to the intern)
What'll it be, Ace? We gotta fix
this guy so Boston's finest can
interrogate him to death.

The intern mumbles, exhausted, panicked. The man's chest
gurgles. :

INTERN
Ten cc's of lidocaine.

DENISE
Lidocaine? That was the sucker's
lung collapsing.

The intern mumbles incoherently. We HEAR, "BP sixty over
forty..." It's now or never, so Denise takes over.

DENISE (CONT'D)
Get a tube in his chest....

Denise continues to bark orders over the gurney as it rolis
down the hall to the OR...we HEAR..."large bore IV..."

The intern shakes, confused and alone. After a few beats,
when it registers that a nurse has taken charge, the intern
comes to life, chases the gurney, shouting.

INTERN
Wait. I'm the doctor here!

FIND RIVERA, his tense face pock-marked like the moon.
Denise's voice is like the low growl of a doberman on a short

leash.

RIVERA
-+-he was the doctor on call.

DENISE
He's an asshole.

RIVERA
You know the rules.

DENISE
The rules don't say I gotta wait for
some moron to figure out which end
of the stethoscope to use.

RIVERA
We're offering you a suspension.
Without pay, of course.

DENISE
What a deal.

+ RIVERA
I'd take it if I were you. It could
“ be worse.

DENISE
Yeah. How?

RIVERA
The family of the dead boy isn't
pressing charges.

A long pause.

DENISE

This stinks.
RIVERA

Off the record. You're right.

I'm not taking the suspension.
RIVERA

I didn't say it was a choice.

EXT. GIL'S DONUTS ~ ESTABLISHING - DAY

INT. DONUT SHOP

Denise scans the highway, brow furrowed. Across from her is
SAM, age ten. He knows she's worried.

SAM
Ma, how many psychiatrists does it
take to change a light bulb?

DENISE
I give.

. SAM
None. The light bulb has gotta want
to change itself. Get it?

Denise looks at her son tenderly, wipes cherry filling from
his lips, plops a Celtics hat on his head.

DENISE
Yeah, I get it, smartypants.

A_car horn HONKS in the b.g. Denise stiffens when she sees
MITCH, a swarthy Italian, waving from his muscle car. APRIL
sits next to him. Barbie-doll pretty, all smiles. Sam jumps

up to leave.

DENISE (CONT'D)
(to Sam)
Six o'clock. No excuses.

GIL, the 50+ Italian donut shop owner, catches Sam.

GIL
How 'bout a hug for your old uncle.

Sam hugs Gil, kisses his mom, bolts for the door.

DENISE
{about April)
That woman has more teeth than the
winner of the Kentucky Derby.

Denise starts to go.

GIL
Denise, wait.

Gil takes her hand, puts a wad of cash in it. Denise's jaw
tightens. Crying is out of the question.

 
 

She puts the cash in Gil's shirt pocket, shakes her head,
"no".

GIL (CONT'D)
What's an old man like me gonna do
with extra cash?

DENISE
Spend it on blondes?

A look passes between them. Gil gently puts the cash back in
Denise's hands.

DENISE (CONT'D)
You're the only good man I know.

GIL
And don't you forget it.

A pasty, over-weight PERSONNEL DIRECTOR skims her computer
while chewing a milky way as if it were cud. Denise waits.

Liberty Street.

DENISE
What is that..a shoe store?

PERSONNEL DIRECTOR
Convalescent. Sort of.

DENISE

EXT. COPLEY SQUARE - RESTAURANT - DAY - ESTABLISHING

INT. RESTAURANT

Denise sits across the table from a blowzy blonde (MARION)
with a no-nonsense jaw, who shuffles through legal briefs.

MARION
Taking a moral stand is admirable if
you're Jesse Jackson. So, as your
lawyer, I suggest...

DENISE
Wait a minute, I don't want to hear
that Mitch has a chance...

MARION
With you out of work, you better
believe it. He makes his support
payments, sees Sam regularly...

DENISE
He disappeared for three months with
a bimbo.

MARION

A bimbo he's planning to marry.
Frankly, I think he has a good chance
of getting joint custody. You could
have a worse guy for an ex.

DENISE
Yeah, maybe Charles Manson. Look,
you don't get it.

(MORE)
 

DENISE. (CONT'D)
If he gets joint custody, it means
he has a say in what Sam does; which
means he has a say in what I do and
there's no way in heli that slimy
bastard is gonna control me anymore.

MARTON
Still planning on moving to California
with Sam?

DENISE *

If I didn't have so many damn lawyer
bills I'd be long gone.

MARION
Maybe you should've thought about
that before you quit your job.

DENISE

You know what's brown and white and
looks good on a lawyer?

MARION
I've heard it. Get a job, Denise.
Any job.

In her well-worn Ford escort, Denise passes a sign from the
Massachusetts Historical Society that marks the entrance to

a township called "Danvers".

Denise rushes past Cape Cods and federal houses heavy with
tradition. She checks the address of @ square, brick house
with a white picket fence. ivy climbs the front face of 14
Liberty Street from the ground to the widow's walk that caps

the hipped roof.

ruddy-faced and uncomfortable in a rented tux; she wears a
"mother-of-the-bride” polyester copy. She dabs her eyes.

MINISTER (0.S.)

of a verse in the Song of Solomon...

INT. HOTEL BANQUET ROOM - DAY

The home video camera widens and swerves to reveal the couple
among the other guests. White satin, lots of doves and too-
tall floral arrangements thinly disguise the banquet room as
a wedding chapel. The video camera pans across the aisle to
the groom's PARENTS whose expressions are pinched.

Two WOMEN in their eighties sit beside a wheel-chair bound
young woman (GRETCHEN) who wears horn-rimmed glasses. The
wheel~chair is decorated with white satin ribbons and pink
flowers. Behind Gretchen, a SOLDIER eyes a buxom REDHEAD
across the aisle. His WIFE notices and elbows him sharply.

MINISTER (0.S.) (CONT'D)
+.-for loving someone is like holding

sand...

Denise stands at the back of the room beside an Ichabod-
Crane looking man (MAX) who's in a wheelchair. Denise's look

is distant.

MINISTER (0.8.) (CONT'D)

The amateur camera person moves behind the minister.

thee, Rose...

Denise has had it. She slips out the back door.

INT. HOTEL HALLWAY

Denise escapes into the claustrophobic hallway rancid with
smoke and earth-tone’ carpets. She pulls a cigarette from her
bag, lights up. In the b.g. a loud "NO" stops her action. A
young man (RICK) wearing a trench coat and fedora ‘a la Bogart
is mid~argument with Charlie.

RICK
No. No. I...I won't go.

CHARLIE
Rick, I can't leave you alone.

Denise stares. There's something wrong, but what? Rick is
mid-twenties with the build of a running back. His face is
boyishly handsome but there is something....disconnected...
about him. Charlie gently tugs him by the arm.

RICK
(too loud)
No. You can't make me. You can't.

CHARLIE ; i
Now what did we agree on, huh? &

Rick clasps his hands to his ears, swings from side to side,
the gestures exaggerated, his reactions extreme.

RICK

don't, I don’t.

Great. Loonies. I hate loonies.

She starts to walk away. Hears a "hey you" but keeps walking.
Then a "Denise." She grimaces, busted.

CHARLIE
Stay with Rick for me. And make sure
he doesn't run off anywhere.

Denise forces a resigned smile. Charlie ducks back into the
ceremony. Rick looks Denise up and down, nothing subtle in
his examination of her. Denise sense his desire to speak,
but he can't engage his brain. He strains, searching for
every word. When he speaks, his voice is thick and Slightly
monotone. Even so, Rick's eyes, when they connect, reveal a
natural intelligence.

RICK
You're, you're not Kelly.

DENISE
Good call, Ace.

RICK

I'm not, not Ace. I'm Ricky.

(in a deeper, "man's"

voice)
I mean, Rick.

(a kid's voice again)
And, and I'm not gonna talk until,
until Kelly c..comes.

Rick plops on the floor, cross-legged in protest.

DENISE
Fine by me.

Those...those stink.

DENISE
Hey, you wanta talk or you don't
wanta talk, I don't care. But don't
bust my chops. .

RICK
If you, you don't stop that, I'll
run, run away.

Denise chases after him. She swears. He's fast.

Rick runs down the long hallway and out an emergency exit.
Sirens SCREECH.

EXT. HOTEL - AFTERNOON

Rick covers his ears, screams along with the sirens. Denise
catches him, tries to calm him down. Hotel personnel scurry
to the scene. Denise turns to see the wedding party and all
of the guests spill into the Parking lot, dismayed. Charlie
glares at Denise.

Across the hall, the library of the old house is used as the
Administrator's office. LUCY ZACHARY has the title. She is
mid-forties, a she~bear of a woman. She talks rapid-fire on
the phone, feet up on a cherry~wood desk.

The front door opens and in blasts DEREK, early "20"'s, Downs
Syndrome. He wears a "Chicken Lickin" Delivery Hat. He slips

behind Justine, tickles her.

DEREK
Tex, you she-devil. So how was the

wedding?

Ad lib answers. Derek eyes the cards. Looks at Rick, jealousy
apparent.

DEREK (CONT'D)

(to Rick)
Hey, Bogie. Poker’s only five cards.
You're so dense...

Rick is red-faced, flustered. Ad-lib from the others..."lay
off, Derek..." Rick breathes heavily, stares at the table.

DEREK (CONT'D)
Hey, it's not my fault he's
hopeless...

A pause. Denise stares hard at Derek. She hates bullies.

DENISE
It's another game. He just forgot,
the first two cards are down, the
rest are up. It's called stud poker.

Everyone reacts to the word "stud" as adolescents would. Ad
lib "oooh, Rick"... He smiles, vindicated. A look passes
between Denise and Rick. A truce.

Derek grimaces. Charlie appears, wearing an apron.

CHARLIE
(to the group)
Do I look like Betty Crocker to you?
You all get your butts in the kitchen.
Help me get dinner,

The game breaks up amid grumbling. Derek darts away with a
look that promises a future show down. Rick lage behind,
approaches Denise. All is forgiven.

Lucy enters, talking out loud.
LUCY

Lucy
Five bedrooms up, three down. Eight
residents. Rose and Ben are our first
married couple. You know the word,
"Convalescent". It's supposed to
mean, "become well again." Most of
the time it translates as "waiting
to die". Trust me, nobody waits at
Liberty Street. For anything.

DENISE
Good. .

LUCY
You bet it's good. And if anybody on
the outside refers to this place as
a “home” they answer to me.

(points at the rooms)
Gretchen's a librarian, sharp as a
tack that one; Tex is a clerk, Max
works for a publishing firm as an
indexer. Everybody who lives here
learns to go out in the world just
like you and me.

 

 

DENISE
Teach ‘em to join the rat race, huh.
Sometimes I'm not so sure it's an
advantage.

Lucy
You would if you couldn't do it.

Lucy
He's new. We're still trying to place
him in a job.

Jesus.

Lucy

Oh, he's on the road to recovery.

{on her look)
His memory's not great, he's easily
frustrated and he's got a helluva
temper but his IQ is well above
normal. Physically, he's fine.
Mentally, emotionally, that's
something else. His mom's kept him
at home much too isolated.

DENISE
Will he ever be...uh...

Lucy
"Normal?" Whatever that is.
(shaking her head))
Our toughest case. He's a grown man
with the personality of a moody
adolescent because his mother refuses
to let go. Our job is to channel all

that energy.

DENISE
Rick's or his mother's?

LUCY
Both. So. Why'd you quit the E.R.?
DENISE
(off guard)

Let's say management and I had a
parting of the ways.

LUCY
Okay. This place is a far cry from
meatball surgery.

DENISE
Sounds good so far.

Lucy
The work is one on one, mostly tedious
and very repetitive. There's no
instant gratification, no adrenalin
highs and I haven't saved a life
since the cat choked on a fur ball.

DENISE
Look, you need a nurse and I need a
job. Do we have a deal or what?

LUCY

Chaos. There's a dining room table sans chairs, a TV dinner

DEREK
No joke. This is stupid.

The women "shush” him. The NARRATOR continues in the b.g.

INT. BATHROOM-- MOMENTS LATER

Rick slams the door like he's chased by demons. He leans

back on it, Sweating, eyes shut. After a few beats he steps

to the mirror, looks at his face. His hand reaches up, touches
the shadow of his beard. He examines the hair poking through
his shirt. He looks frightened as if the face looking back

at him is foreign.

RICK

Ricky...where is Ricky?

He repeats his name as if it were connected to a distant
memory. Someone POUNDS on the door. He jumps.

Hey, I got more photos.

One has hooters to here.

Rick glares at Derek, takes the ball out, throws it awkwardly
to Justine. She fakes out Max and sky-hooks a great hoop.
Rick "high fives" her.

Derek wolf whistles at Justine. He nudges Rick, whispers
something dirty in Rick's ear. Rick loses his temper, pushes
Derek, who swings, landing a soft blow to Rick's arm.

Rick punches Derek square in the face. Derek collapses like
a broken doll. He rolis on the ground, blood spurting. Rick
falls on him, grabs him by the throat. Denise jumps on Rick's
back, tries to pull him off Derek. The other residents SCREAM

at Rick to stop.

DENISE
Stop it, Rick. Stop it. Look at me.

Rick stops, looks in Denise's eyes. But he doesn't remember
her. She catches her breath, his rage intimidating. He looks
at his’ swollen fist, at Derek writhing under him. Rick's

mood swings from rage to confusion. He jumps off Derek, turns
to Denise. When his eyes finally register recognition he is
overwhelmed with sorrow.

RICK
I used to be different. I used to
be, to be different...

Denise chills at his panicked insight.

RICK (CONT'D)
Help me. Help me find him. Please, I
know you can help me.

DENISE

Rick grabs her around the waist, buries his head, sobbing.

Denise loses her temper. Over-reacts.

slides through his fingers. Rick picks the ball up, turns it
over slowly.

Denise watches. What is he trying to remember?

Rick looks up, smiles. He gestures for Sam to run. When Sam
is well down field, Rick lets the ball fly. A beautiful pass.

Sam tosses the ball to Rick. It's a wild throw that runs
Rick into a COUPLE'S picnic. Rick catches the ball mid-air,
saving the startled couple but fritos are airborn.

Denise waves for Rick and Sam to come closer together so she
: can get another snapshot. She doesn't see a raggedy MAN,
wavering, drunk approach her in the b.g. He puts his hand on
her shoulder to steady himself.

 

RAGGEDY MAN
Hey, pretty lady...

Denise spins around ready to fight. But Rick is by her side
in an instant. Sam stays a safe distance behind Rick.

RAGGEDY MAN
Don't go gettin' all excited. I's
just in need of spare. change.

Denise touches Rick's arm.

DENISE
It's okay.

She gives the man some money.

RAGGEDY MAN
Thank you, m'am.

The raggedy man hurries away. Rick relaxes. Denise is touched

) DENISE
Well, I see chivalry is not dead.
Rick looks at her, blinks.
RICK
Huh?
As quickly as he responded is how quickly he slips away.
Sam runs out for another pass and the game begins again.
Denise watches Rick. Her expression is wistful.

There's the driveway. Paid. I got

DENISE
Pretty good deal, huh.

Denise turns into the long, horseshoe-shaped driveway. The
house is majestic, regal. Sam and Denise are in awe.

RICK

My money.

SAM

Wow. This is better than a castle.
Denise searches the car, pulls out an old donut box.

DENISE
Put your money in this. But make
sure nobody knows where it is but
you. It's a secret.

Rick nods, climbs out. A uniformed BUTLER appears at the
front door. Rick waves to him. Ad lib goodbyes. In the rear~
view mirror Denise sees Rick disappear into the house. For
the first time, he hasn't watched her go. Her brow furrows.

INT. SPENCER MANSION FOYER

Rick playfully tosses the football to Harold. The butler is
surprised and drops it. Rick picks it up, tosses it up in

RICK

I had fun today.

She sees the football and over-reacts.

ELEANOR (CONT'D)
Give the ball to Harold, Ricky.

RICK
No. It's mine.

It's my fault, Mrs. Spencer.

Eleanor's look is better than an order. Harold gently takes
the ball from Rick.

ELEANOR
Go and wash up for dinner, Rick.

Right now.

Rick is humiliated and hurt. He stomps up the stairs.

INT. RICK'S BEDROOM

Expensively furnished but cold-and oddly non-descript. The
only photos are one each of Eleanor and and Rick's father in
separate silver frames. Rick lies on his bed reading a book.
Hand over one eye, he mouths the words.

After a few beats, he puts the book down, rubs his eyes. He
frowns, looks at his closet and is suddenly curious.

He opens the walk-in closet door like an archeologist in
search of past treasures. He sees brown boxes stacked ‘loor

to ceiling. Rick opens one, finds a teddy bear and other
children's toys. He puts them back, tries another box.

Rick pulls out a football jersey, Number "59". Under it, he
finds a high school yearbook. He thumbs through the book, a
puzzled look on his face. He stops. Stares. We see what he's
looking at. There’s a photo of himself, years younger, wearing
the number "59" football jersey. His arm is around a pretty
blonde girl. The look on his face becomes strained. He
squints, tries to retrieve a memory. After a beat, he shakes
his head in frustration, pounds his fist.

Eleanor sleeps with eye-shades. Distant SOUNDS of laughter
awaken her. Groggy, she gets up, goes to the window. When
she moves the curtain, brilliant morning light pours in.

ELEANOR'S POV

In the back garden, Rick, wearing his old football jersey,
has the staff engaged in a game of touch football. BESSIE,
the cook throws a pass, landing the football in the birdbath.

Everyone laughs. Rick glances up, sees Eleanor staring at
them. His expression causes the staff to immediately stiffen.

Rick, defiantly retrieves the football from the birdbath and
tosses it to Harold.

Eleanor is mortified.

Rick tosses the football up and down. Cathleen follows her
mother to a mercedes. The young woman looks over, smiles at
Rick with tears in her eyes. Rick looks puzzled. He just

Rick enters with a tray full of donuts. Two s ingy-t
PUNKS are there. Gil's hands are behind his head.

Hi. How are you today?
(about Gil's hands)
Is that a game?

PUNK WITH GOLD TOOTH
Yeah, it's a game wise ass. Lose the
donuts and get over here.

GIL
Do.what they say, Rick.

Rick looks puzzled, but puts the donuts down, approaches Gil
hands behind his head. Both punks are shaky, strung-out and
badly in need of a fix.

PUNK #1
Put the money from the cash register
in the bag.

That's Gil's money.

Rick starts to get mad.
RICK
(loudly) )
You're a bunch of...of..jerks. Jerks.

PUNK #1
What're you some retard?

Rick's temper flares. He slugs the punk in the face, screaming

f fiercely. The punk drops to his knees, blood spurts from his
5) nose. His friend doesn't know what to do.
. RICK

= am not a retard! I am not a retard.
And you can't have this money. This
is Gil's money!

PUNK #1
That asshole broke my nose.

The punk with the gold tooth, panics, pulls a gun. When Rick
sees the gun, he SCREAMS, goes ballistic. He starts throwing
anything he can at the punks; trays, donuts, a coffee machine.
The punk with the broken nose crawls to the door. Gil ducks
from flying objects. He throws cash at the punks.

GIL
Don't shoot. Take it and go.

But Rick is unstoppable. He heaves a chair at the punks but
it misses and crashes through the store window. The punk
shoots at Rick, also missing. In the b.g. a crowd gathers, a
police siren is HEARD. The punks beat a hasty retreat.

EXT. DONUT SHOP - LATER

son ever be capable of making
decisions...as an adult?

Derek shoves his way to the spot he left Rick, a beer in

inside with Sam. Rick leans against the post, stares out
into the night.

CUT TO:

INT. MOTEL ROOM - PRE-DAWN

Denise is awakened by Sam, whispering. It's a beat before
she realizes he's on the phone.

It'll call you again, Dad- Peal soon.

Sam's anger starts slow, escalates.

SAM

DENISE

SAM

I hate it that you and Dad don't
like each other. Why does it have
to be that way?

Wait a minute...

SAM
I never thought it would happen. I
never thought we'd go to stupid
California but now, I'll...

wish you would just grow up...

He runs from the room. Denise gets up, stumbles for her robe,
trips, swears. .

EXT. MOTEL - DAWN

Denise runs from the room. She sees Rick walking towards

the room. He intercepts Sam who is still furious and flailing
with his feet and fists. Rick wraps Sam in his arms as Sam
sobs uncontrollably.

Denise's face is anguished with quilt.

“INT. COFFEE SHOP - MORNING

 

 

In, in California,

DENISE
(takes his hand)
We can't go to California. It's
tearing Sam apart.

RICK
But, but I can't, can't go back.

DENISE
We can deal with your mother together.

RICK
(a pause)
Since, since I ran away...I've, I've

I, I love you, Denise. And, and I
love Sam. But, but i can't be, the
old Rick. Not for anybody.

They share a look that moves from understanding to a painful
awareness that their paths may no longer be the same. A
tough broad WAITRESS steps up.

 

WAITRESS
So, what'll it be?

DENISE
{to Rick, quietly)
Please don't make me choose.

WAITRESS
(looking at her pad)
Sorry, lady you gotta choose. ‘Sides
it ain't life and death, it's only
the breakfast rush.

Denise stares at the waitress.

Sam darts away. Denise watches him, her back to the road.
DENISE (CONT'D)

Rick walking toward the cab. Denise darts for the truck.

The engine accelerates with a ROAR.

Denise's first impulse is to go after him. But when she turns
to run for the car, she sees something that stops her.

DENISE'S POV
Sam is wearing Rick's fedora. It takes her breath away.

SAM
Rick said he doesn't need it anymore.

Denise nods. She takes Sam by the hand, looks over her
shoulder at the truck barreling into the distance.
