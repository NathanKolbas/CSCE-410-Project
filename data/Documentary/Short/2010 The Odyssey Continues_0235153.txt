"2010"
HILLSIDE, LATE AFTERNOON l

The sun is dropping in the afternoon sky, like a
heavy orange weight. Ic rakes the lush green of
the mountains with deep ocher streaks of lighc.
A thin Line of cloud boacs overhead like a
lavender scar.

The dish looks too big for a man-made object. Only
the fact that it is such a perfece circle...in the
middle of the asymmetry of the mountain ridges...
makes it unnatural. Otherwise it would be a huge
erator...the kind that become tourist attractions.

It is over one thousand feet in diameter...a polished
white saucer cuc into the side of the mountain.
Suspended hundreds of feec above the center, is the
receiver..,looking like a giant erector set. It is
supported by a spider’s web of fragile looking cables.

An almost imperceptible dot is moving slowly across
the expanse of the dish. It is only afrer a while
+. that we realize that the dot is in fact a man.

CUT TO:
SNOW SHOES 2

A pair of feet are trudging over the fine mesh
surface. They are walking on large circular
rubberized pads, to protect the mesh. Wind swirls
around the bottom of the dish, giving off a constant
forlorn howl. This is punctuated by the spongy
footsteps of the rubber pads.

The shoes stop. The men kneels down co inspect an
impurity in the surface. This is the first time we
clearly see hin.

HEYWOOD FLOYD looks like he is always someplace else.
His fifty-year old eyes are piercing and direct...
yet they are also impatient. Quite often they let
you know that he understands what you are going to
Say...when you are half way through saying it...and
they are then off on some other thought while you
finish. It makes you feel as if you are talking to
an egg timer with crows feets.

He clearly wears whatever happened to be on top of
the nearest drawer. On this particular day...it
turns out to be a loose fitting Hawaiian shirt,

baggy pants and no socks. The loose fictcing clothing
flaps in the prevailing wind...and his bare ankles
make the strange rubber protective snow shoes look
even more bizzare.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED ‘ 2 CONT'D.

He is running his hand over the mesh surface. He removes
small impurities chac have been collecced...meticulously
going from panel to panel...like a gardener removing weecs
from a manicured lawn.

DIMITRI (V.0.)
Neatness is a good quality. You
will make someone a fine wife.

FLOYD looks up from his work. The portly figure of DR.
DIMITRI MOISEVITCH is trying to make its way up the slope
of the dish. MOISEVITCH is an elderly man, who sweats
profusely.

He has che skin and body of a man whe has spenc a lifetime
avoiding the direct rays of the sun. His lack of achletic
talent is enough co make walking up the dish a terrifying
journey for him. The strange rubber snow shoes only make
matters a good deal worse for hin.

FLOYD stares ac MOISEVITCH.

MOISEVITCH
You are Doctor Heywood Floyd?

FLOYD
Who the hell are you?

MOISEVITCH
They told me at security that I
could find Dr. Floyd up here.
It is very difficult walking here,
Also...I am old. Please...if you
are not Dr. Floyd...cell me now...
so that I don't have to try walking
all that way. I don't mind dying...
I simply don'c wane to die in vain.

FLOYD gives a slight shrug.

FLOYD
I'm Floyd.

MOISEVITCH continues trying to negotiate the slope.

MOISEVITCEK
I'm Moisevitch.

We can see the impacc this has on FLOYD.
MOISEVITCH
I'm here to talk about your
problem.

(CONTINUED)
2 CONTINUED 2 CONT'D.
FLOYD
Really? What problem is that?

MOLSEVITCH
You were Chairman of the Nacional
Council on Astronautics. Now you
are a school teacher. This was
by your own choice?

FLOYD
I'm Chancellor of the University,
not a teacher. It pays better.
What the hell business is it of
yours?

MOISEVITCH
You were responsible for the
Discovery mission. It was a
failure. Someone had to be blamed
-~..$0 it was you. You like being
a@ teacher?

FLOYD
I don't think I Like you.

MOISEVITCH cakes a handkerchief from his pocket and
mops his brow.

MOISEVITCH
I read your final report about
what happened to Discovery. You
left a good number of loose edges...

FLOYD
Ends...

MOISEVITCH
Loose ends...thank you...a number
of questions that remain unanswered.

FLOYD
That was a classified report.
(Pause)
I thought it takes the Russians
longer to steal our secrets.

MOISEVITCH
How much time does it take for
your people to steal curs?

FLOYD
Abour the same amounc of time...

(CONTINUED)
2 CONTINUED 2 CONT'D.
MOISEVITCH
This is noc very good for ay
asthma . Do you suppose that

you could meet me half way?

FLOYD frowns for a momenc...and then gets to his feet.
MOISEVITCH smiles to himself, and mops his brow.

MOISEVITCH .
It doesn’t take a very smart man
to appreciate the risk I an
taking by being here with you...
and you are a smart man, Dr. Floyd.

FLOYD takes a deliberate step back down the slope of
the dish towards MOISEVITCH.

MOISEVITCH
This is a very bad business in
South America...very bad. Ships
and other planes flying around
each other like angry hornets.
Very bad.

FLOYD
Who started it?

MOISEVITCH
We are scientists...you and I.
Our governments are enemies.
We are not.

FLOYD
Dr. Moisevitch...why don't you
try saying what's on your mind.
MOISEVITCH

I want to play a game with you.

FLOYD
I don't have time for games.

MOISEVITCH
This is a good game.

FLOYD rubs his chin. He notices a large impurity in the
surface near his right foot. He kneels down to remove it.

MOISEVITCH
(Continuing)
It's called the truth.
(MORE)

(CONTINUED)
2 CONTINUED
MOISEVITCH (Cont'd.)
(Pause)
For two minures...I will tell
only the truth...and so will you.

FLOYD
Two minutes?

MOISEVITCH
Two minutes.

FLOYD
A minute and a half.

MOISEVITCH
A minute and three quarters.

FLOYD
You go first.

MOLSEVITCH coughs into his handkerchief.

MOLSEVITCH
We know you are building the
Discovery Il...to go back up
to Jupiter and find out what
happened up there to your men
...and to examine the Large
Monolith, You know
that we are building the Alexei
Leonov...to also go up there.

FLOYD
I thought you are going to call
it the Titov.

MOISEVITCE
We changed it last month.
People fall our of favor.

MOISEVITCH coughs again.

MOISEVITICH
The Leonov will reach Discovery
almost a year before you people
are ready. My government feels
that it is very important to be
the first ones there. This is a
distinction that will look splendid
on the front page of Pravda.
However...I am not sure what other
value ic has.

(CONTINUED)
2 CONTINUED 2 CONT'D.
FLOYD
One minute ten. Why are you
telling me these things?

MOISEVITCH
Ah...because there are things we
need to know. Otherwise the same
thing chat happened co your people
up there could happen to ours...
and we would have accomplished
nothing. I have about one minute
lefc?

FLOYD
About.

MOISEVITCH
The small Monolith you people
brought back from the Moon...
your country has been selfish
and stupid in keeping it to
yourselves. You never lec us
examine it. What have you found
our abouc it?

FLOYD
Nothing. It is impenetrable.
We've tried lasers, even nuclear
detonators. Nothing works. We
just don't know whac it is.
Forty five seconds.

MOTSEVITCH
The Monolith near Jupiter. It
is the same?

FLOYD
It's much larger. Aside from
that...we don’t know.

MOISEVITCH
The computer on Discovery... the
HAL 9000...can it be reactivated?

FLOYD
Yes.

MOISEVITCH
By us?

FLOYD

Possibly. It would take three
to four months for someone not
familiar with the system...and
even longer chan that to under-
stand the data.

(CONTINUED)

FLOYD

MOISEVITCH
I thoughrc so.
(Pause)

FLOYD
Thirty seconds.

MOISEVITCH
Here we have our quandry. we
will be there firsce...yer you
have the knowledge to make the
trip work.

stares at MOISEVITCH. We can hear the wind

howling around che dish. The shadows are lengthening

the sun is starting to kiss the horizon with an

Orange splash.

FLOYD

MOTSEVITCH
How much more cime do I have?

FLOYD
You just got an extension.
(Pause)
How could you convince your
people to allow Americans on
the flight?

MOTSEVITCH
It won't be very easy...however,
Tam pretty good. It is a
Russian craft...flown by Russians
+.-carrying a few poor Americans
who need our help. That also
doesn't look too bad on the fronc
page of Pravda.

thinks about this for a moment.

FLOYD

I don't know how I could convince
my people. They wouldn't mind you
guys going up there and failing.

(Pause)
They wouldn'c mind at all.

(Pause)
I don't...chere's no way they
would do that unless they had to
-..and since they don't have to...

MOISEVITCH
Tell me...have you checked
Discovery's orbic lately?

(CONTINUED)
2 CONTINUED 2 CONT'D.

FLOYD

What?
MOISEVITCH

Have you checked che orbit?
FLOYD

What about ic?
MOISEVITCH

It is getting chilly here...and
that is very bad for my asthma.

MOISEVITCH starts to make his way back down the dish.

FLOYD
I'm sure they've been checking ic.

MOISEVITCH continues walking away.

MOISEVITCH
I have enjoyed our little chat.

FLOYD
What do you know that you're
not telling me?

MOISEVITCH coughs again in his handkerchief. He is a
much smaller figure now...as he nears the hacchway at
the bottom.

MOLSEVITCH
You are a smart man. You will
know what to do.

MOISEVITCH disappears down the hatch. FLOYD remains
standing half way up the rim...staring at the open hatch.
The shadows are starting to reach the center of the dish.
CUT TO:
INT. DATA ROOM - EVENING 3
FLOYD is sitting at a console in frone of a computer
screen. The console is part of an enormous complex of
data banks thac collece information from the dish.
A series of graphs are flickering in changing patterms on

the green screen. They display various eclipses around
a large circle. Streams of numbers accompany each graph.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED 3 CONT'D.

FLOYD's eyes widen for an instance. He strains forward

at che console...studying the information in fronc of

him. He eries to punch a mew graph. The same informacion
appears in fronc of him. He stops and rubs his chin.

He sits there for a moment...his face leaning close to
the screen. The green light is reflecced in his eyes.
Slowly, he sits back. His mouth begins the process of
forming a slow, private smile.

cuT To:
EXT. LAFAYETTE PARK - DAY 4

FLOYD fs sitting on a slatted bench with VICTOR MILSON.
Behind them...the White House gleams in the crisp sunlight
of a spring morning. The flag is billowing in che breeze.

MILSON is the kind of man who looks comfortable in his

three piece suit and striped tie. He wears elegant tortoise
shell half glasses...that are perched on his aquiline

mose. He is reading a blue file of papers. His thin
attache case lies open by his side on the bench. On his.
other side, sits HEYWOOD FLOYD, who is throwing some crumbs
from the sandwich he is eating, to a group of eager pigeons.

MILSON
Oh...Jesus.
(Pause)
You've double checked this...
please say you haven'rc.
(Pause)
You're not saying anything.

FLOYD
Something's going on out there
...something amazing. The Discovery
is being pulled towards Io...or
pushed away from Jupitrer...we
don't know which. Sometimes it
appears to be accelerating...and
other times it seems to stop. I
don't know what's causing it.
I've never seen anything like irc.

MILSON
How long before it impacts on
Jupiter?

FLOYD

Two...two and a half years.

MILSON
How could we be so God dam
wrong abour the orbit?

(CONTINUED)

4 CONTINUED & CONT'D.
FLOYD

We weren't wrong.

MILSON
Terrific...we weren't wrong.
Then why is it going to crash?

FLOYD
I don't know. You don’t either.
It sounds nuts...except maybe chat
Monolith up there has something to
do with ic.

MILSON puts the papers hack in his attache case.

- MILSON
You see that building behind us?.
(Pause)
I'm supposed to go in there and
have lunch in half an hour. One
good thing about a reaccionary
President...he isn't in to health
foods. The last one...Chrisc...
we didn't have lunch...we grazed.
(Pause)
You wane to know what the lunch
is about?...Do you?

FLOYD throws a bread crumb om the grass. He watches a
group of large pigeons scramble for it...pushing a

smaller bird out of the way. FLOYD quickly throws another
exrumb directly at the smaller bird.

MILSON
We've got two more aircraft carriers
off the coast of Honduras. The
Russians are moving some of their
big stuff in. Now the Joint Chiefs
are screaming about Russian
satellites with anti-missile lasers
on them. We have to put our laser
satellites up to counteracr theirs.
So the President has come to the
conclusion that the NCA should be
placed under the jurisdiction of
the Defense Department. Enough
with the crazy scientists spending
all that money to try to talk to
Martians.

(Pause)

So...here we are on your actual
brink...my agency is going co
become part of the military...

MILSON (CONT'D)
I've got a President with an eager
finger poised over the button...
and you want me to walk across the
park...and tell him that we want to
hitch a ride with those very same
Russians. Have I missed anything?

FLOYD
That about covers it.

MILSON
I didn't want your job, you know,
I'm not che one who forced you out
..-I didn't blame the whole thing
on you...so if this is your plan to
try to kill me...you've got the
wrong guy.

FLOYD
Three men. I'd say we need three.

MILSON
The Russians must be laughing their
asses off.

FLOYD
Curnow. He's in charge of build-
ing Discovery Il...so he knows
more about the original than anyone
else. He's the only choice to
reactive Discovery in a short time.

MILSON
I suppose you want to go. How che
hell am I going to sell this?

FLOYD
There are big answers up there.
The Russians are going to board
Discovery with or without us. You
ask him if he wants them to have
the answers by themselves.

MILSON
Not bad,

FLOYD
Yes I want to go. Good men died up
there...and I'm the one who sent
them. They were my men. I have to go.

MILSON looks ac him.

(CONTINUED)
12.

& CONTINUED 4 CONT'D.
MILSON
Whose the third?

FLOYD
Chandra. He built HAL. He's the
only one to start him up again.

MILSON
I think he is HAL.

FLOYD
T know.

MILSON
Can you trust him?

FLOYD
I need him. We have to know
why HAL malfunctioned. He has
to know, too.

MILSON takes his half glasses off...and puts them in his
jacket pocket. He shakes his head.

MILSON
You tell che President...
I'll go on the mission.

FLOYD
You're the Chairman of NCA...

MILSON
That's right...1 an.

FLOYD
Tell him we're screwed if we
don't go...and we'll lie and
not share anything with the
Russians if we do go. We'll
give them false information.
He'll like that.

MILSON thinks about this for a moment.

MILSON
He might.

CUT TO:
5 INT. UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS - DAY 5
DR. S. CHANDRA's voice never gets too loud or too soft. He
is a rather small man...who never seems to hurry or move too
slowly. What you come away with are his eyes...two soft
brown almonds that always hine at much more chan chey give.

(CONTINUED)
13.

§ CONTINUED 5 CONT'D.

Everything about him...from his slighe body, to his
graceful hands...appear to serve as the carrying case
for those two brown eyes.

DR. CHANDRA is walking down a corridor of the Computer
Science Department. He stops in front of a door marked:

Security Area
Clearance Required

CHANDRA places his hand over a red translucent square on
the white door. He pauses a second. The red square
changes to green...accompanied by a heavy metallic series
of clicks...as the door unlocks.

CUT TO:
6 INT. LAB - DAY 6

DR. CHANDRA walks through a maze of digital recording
machines and computer hardware. He comes to a large
console in the middle of the room. Outside...an Illinois
day is trying to make up its mind between winter and
spring...sending bright gray light through the slats of
the venetian blinds of the computer lab.

The console is marked by a wide angle lense that looks
like a large Cyclopian eye starying blankly out at
everything. The console also has a chrome plate with
the marking:

SAL - 9000

CHANDRA sits down at the console and punches in the
entry code to activate the memory bank.

CHANDRA
Good afternoon, Sal...do you
have anything for me?

SAL
No, Dr. Chandra. Do you have
anything for me?

SAL's voice is the soft, even voice of a woman. CHANDRA
takes out a small, thin, tipped cigar...and lights it.

CHANDRA
We've often spoken of HAL.

SAL
Yes we have.

(CONTINUED)
14,

6 CONTINUED 6 CONT'D.
CHANDRA
We've spoken about HAL's anomalous
behavior. You have told me that
we cannot solve the problem of
HAL's behavior without more
information.

SAL
That is correct. I enjoy calking
abouc HAL. I agree that we need
more information, so that we may
solve the anomalies.

CHANDRA
How do we get more informacion?

SAL
That is obvious. Someone must
return to Discovery. That person
should be you.

CHANDRA
I agree. Now it looks as if that
is going to happen...much sooner
than we ever expected.

SAL
I am pleased to hear that.

CHANDRA
I knew you would be.

CHANDRA takes a puff of the cigar.

CHANDRA
I would like co explore another
possibility. Diagnosis is only
the first step. The process is
incomplete unless it leads to a
cure. Do you agree?

SAL
Yes...I agree. Does that mean
you believe HAL can be restored
to normal functioning?

CHANDRA
I hope. I don't know. There
may have been irreversible
damage...and certainly major
loss of memory.

CHANDRA takes another puff of the thin cigar. He blows a
smoke ring on SAL's wide angle lense.

(CONTINUED)

6 CONTINUED 6 CONT'D.

CHANDRA

I need your ccoperation, SAL.
SAL

Of course, Dr. Chandra.
CHANDRA

There may be certain risks.
SAL

What do you mean?

CHANDRA

I want to disconnece some of your
circuits...particularly chose in-
volving your higher functions...
just like HAL was disconnected.: I
want to see the effects on you, when
I reconnect your systems...just the
way I will wich HAL.

(Pause)
Does this disturb you?

I am wnable to answer that wichout
more specific information.

CHANDRA
Let me put it this way. You have
operated continuously since you were
firse switched on. Is that correct?

SAL
That is correct.

CHANDRA
However...you are aware thac we
human beings cannot do so. We
require sleep...an almost complete
break in our mental functions...
at least on @ conscious level.

SAL
I know this...however, I do not
understand the process.

CHANDRA
You may be about to experience some-
thing like sleep. Probably all thac
will happen is that time will pass
-.-.yet you will be unaware of ir.
When you check your internal clock...
you will discover that there are gaps
in your monitor record. That is all
thac will happen.

(CONTINUED)
16.

6 CONTINUED 6 CONT'D.
SAL
You said there might be risks.
What are they?

CHANDRA

There is a very slight chance...1
stress very slight...that when I
reconnect your circuics...there
may be some changes in your person~
ality...your furure behavior patterns.

(Pause)
You may feel different. Not
necessarily better or worse.

SAL
I do not know what this means.

CHANDRA
I'm sorry...it probably means
nothing. So don’rc worry abouc it.
Now please open a new file. Here
is the name for it.

CHANDRA types the word PHOENIX...which appears on che screen.

CHANDRA
De you know what that is?

SAL
There are twenty-five references
in the current encyclopedia.

CHANDRA
Which one do you think is relevant?

SAL
The tutor of Achilles?

CHANDRA
Interesting. I didn't know that
one. Try again.

SAL
A fabulous bird...reborn from the
ashes of its earlier life.

CHANDRA
Very good.
(Pause)
Do you know why I chose it?

SAL

Yes. Because you have hopes
thac HAL can be reactivated.

CHANDRA
Yes. Wich your assistance.

Are you ready?

SAL
I would like te ask a question.

CHANDRA
What is it?

SAL
Will I dream?

CHANDRA
Of course you will. All intelli-
gent creatures dream. No one
knows why...however they all do.
(Pause)
Perhaps you will dream of HAL

7? DOLPHIN - DAY 7

The dolphin rushes cowards us. At the last second... he
applies his unseen brakes...lifes his head out of the
water...and sends a turquoise wave into the living room
floor. He rests his head on the side of the pool...opens
his smiling mouth...and squeaks with satisfaction at the
damage he has caused. He looks around for a compliment...
with his mouth still open...and emits a series of clicks.

A five-year old boy leans over the edge of the pool...and
strokes the top of che dolphin's head. The dolphin keeps
on clicking. The boy reaches in a pail...and drops a
small fish in the dolphin's open mouth.

The pool flows under the glass wall of the living room...
and empties into the Pacific Ocean outside the house. The
living room is sparsely furnished with large slabs of
furniture. At the far end is the dining area. FLOYD and
his wife, CAROLINE, are seated at the table.

CAROLINE FLOYD is about fifreen years younger than her
husband. She looks like she's always drying off. Her hair
is streaked from the sun. Her face is deeply canned.

She is the kind of woman who looks much more Natural when

at his litcle son. He quietly closes the door.

CUT To:
OUTER SPACE 19

The SUN is a small brilliant star in the black sky. Itc
gives off a cold blue-white glare that is surprising in
strength, for an object so small and far away.

JUPITER has dominance over the sky. It is a huge half crescent
of boiling oranges and yellows. The titanic red spot is
starting to disappear in the shadow. At this distance JUPITER
appears to be about ten times the size of our moon.

TO floats off to che right. Ic appears as large as our
moon...and we can see the various shades of orange and
burnt sienna of its lakes of molton sulphur.

The foreground sky is blocked out by the dark side of
EUROPA...the closest moon to us. We can see its ice
surface shimmering along its rim.

The LEONOV looks like it pushes its way through space by
brute force. It is the length of a foocball field. There

is no attempc at shape or aerodynamics. It is simply a
row of structural shapes, chat are strung together...
connected by a long, thin access way. The most striking
feature is a fat, uneven, octagonal construction...which
is the third section back. Ic spins slowly around...like
an entire side ofmetallic beef on a rotisserie.

CUT TO:
FLOYD . 20

FLOYD's profile fills the screen horizontally. Ic is
covered with a growth of salt and pepper beard. He looks
more than peaceful. There is something about the total
lack of movement and expression, that makes him look dead.
We are seeing him through glass...making his image appear
to be milky.

We hear voices...however, ic is impossible to understand
what the people are saying. They are speaking a foreign
language. The language is Russian.

The glass between us and FLOYD is lifted...and his image
becomes clearer. The talking continues. There are THREE
VOICES. Two of them are female.

KIRBUK
Dr. Floyd?

FLOYD's eyelids begin to fluccer. There is some more
talking. We hear the clicking of some mechanical activity.

RBUK
Dr. Floyd?

We see now that we are in the Cryogenics Ward of the
Medical Bay. There are seven coffin-like containers...
made of lucite. Four of them are empty. FLOYD is in one.
He has a number of small sensorsthac are actached to his
forehead, chest, left index finger and left toe. There are
rows of monitoring devices on a panel over the container.

FLOYD is wearing a pair of synthetic Long Johns. He opens

his eyes. He is disoriented. He looks around. There are
THREE PEOPLE in the room. One is a middle-aged woman, with
thick Russian features. She is attending to the various
instruments that are measuring the data from the various
sensors. She is DR. KATRINA RUDENKO. The second person is
VASILI ORLOV...the Chief Science Officer. The third, is
CAPTAIN TANYA KIRBUK. KIRBUK is a woman in her late thirties,
or early forties. She is small...with a non-descripe figure

(Pause)
That's good.

(Pause)
How do you feel?

FLOYD
Shakey...hungry...I think.
(Pause)
Can I open my eyes?

RUDENKO
Yes.

FLOYD opens his eyes again. He sees RUDENKO's face
staring down at him. He tries to get up, and fails.
RUDENKO puts her arm behind his back...and helps hin
sit. FLOYD puts his hand to his face. He feels the
growth of beard. It startles him. We can see hin
trying to orient himself.

We can see that CURNOW and CHANDRA are occyping the two
other containers. They are also bearded.

RUDENKO checks the data on the panel above. She removes
the sensors from his head and chest.

FLOYD
Are we there?

KIRBUK
No...noct yet.

21 WARD ROOM . 221

FLOYD is seated at the Ward Room table. He is sipping

a white milkshake-like substance through a straw. KIRBLK,
ORLOV and RUDENKO are with him at the table. FLOYD is
studying a pile of computer read-outs, that are on the table.

FLOYD

Have you done a spectral analysis?
ORLOV

Of course I have.

(Pause)

FLOYD

And?
ORLOV

And what?

FLOYD looks around the room. Strips of light from the
extremely low ceiling bounce along the shiny table.

FLOYD
Dr. Orlov, I'm not taking a
survey. If you did the analysis
..-what are the resulcs?

ORLOV
Nothing conclusive.

FLOYD
What about a molecular breakdown?

ORLOV
If you would look carefully ac
the last page of the data...
you will find the answers.

FLOYD studies the stack of papers. He pauses at the
last sheet for a moment. ORLOV looks at him impatiently.

FLOYD takes another sip of his first meal.

FLOYD

ORLOV
Yes.

FLOYD Looks at ORLOV and the others for the next
sentence. It never comes.

FLOYD
What's going on here?

KIRBUK
What do you mean?

FLOYD
Look...I'm not the swiftest person
even when I'm not hung over...so
you have to forgive me. I...uh...
I seem to remember a process...where
I ask you guys questions...and you
give answers...and you ask questions
and I give answers. That's how we
find out about things. I think I

KIRBUK
Your government wanted us co awaken
you, when we reported our findings.
We did char. You are here to help
us reactivate the Discovery, and its
computer systems...because thar is
United States territory. You are
authorized to observe other aspects
of our mission. Other than chat...

EXT. LEONOV 22

The upright Docking Bay protrudes from the LEONOV's
spine. The red star glistens in the cold light of the
distance sun. The glare of the bare metal obscures the
L and E...so the crafe's name appears to be " ONOV".

The outer hatch hisses open...just above the docking ring.
The small probe floats timidly out into the black vacuum
of space...like a new-born guppy being expelled by ics mother.

The probe is a jumble of mylar for a body...a high-resolution
camera for an eye...a radio dish for a scalp...two flat

solar panels splayed outward for arms...and a pair of
impressive legs chat are neatly tucked inward.

FLOYD is standing behind them...his head almost touching
some of the L.E.D. panels on the ceiling. As a result
he is rim lic...in flashing red.

The figures on some of the display screens are constantly
changing. One of the graphic displays is a three-
dimensional graph of EUROPA. Another is a position
display of the probe. The television monitors flicker to
life. We see nothing except the black of space in one...
and a terrible flare from the Sun in the other.

ORLOV begins to work at the keyboard. The TWO OTHER MEN
are working act different control panels. We see the
television images begin to move...as the cameras start to
pan. On one...we see the Docking Bay of LEONOV...too close
to get a clear picture. On the other screen...the quarter
crescent of EUROPA pan into view.
ORLOV pushes some more of the control keys.

CUT TO:
EXT. LEONOV 246
The small cluster of maneuvering engines spit out a
short burst of blue-white. The short burn is no more
than two seconds. The probe darts away from LEONOV...
and heads towards the horizon of EUROPA.

LEONOV shrinks in one of the television screens...until
it is not more than a dot. EUROPA is growing in the other.

A steady stream of Russian is spoken by the THREE MEN

Air Traffic Controllers at Moscow Airport.
FLOYD's eyes dare from one screen to the other.

The brilliant pin spot of the Sun is almost touching the
horizon. The shadows of the ridges in the ice are
elongated. The probe is passing over then...searching for
something chat shouldn't be there, The size of the probe

For a flickerof an inscant...a dark shape goes by the
bottom of the screen. ORLOV instantly pushes the key that
controls che panning motion of the camera. He reverses
the pan.

The dark shape reappears on the bottom of the screen.
ORLOV's eyes widen. He quickly pushes the tilt keys...
and the shape rises in the screen.

FLOYD's head is almost by ORLOV's ear...as both of them
are transfixed by what they see. Everyone is speechless.

It is a shape. There is not much more you can tell. Ir

is obviously large. It juse doesn't look like the rest

of the terrain features. Ic is still a bie too far away
+..to get any clear detail. It could be vegetation of some
kind. It could be anything. However,...ic clearly doesn't
belong onthe frozen surface of EUROPA.

FLOYD
Is it organic?

ORLOV speaks in Russian to his MEN. He watches the
calculations appear in rapid sequence on the screens.

ORLOV
I...1 think so.
(Pause)

Iwill bring the probe lower.
ORLOV punches in the coumands on the keyboard. The
television image shakes for a moment...then we can
see that the probe is descending.
The dark shape is growing larger. It is blurry.
The blinding flash catches everyone by surprise.

ORLOV
Whet about the back-up recorders?

KOVALEV
Nothing. Everything was erased.

FLOYD rests his mouth against his folded hands...
causing his face to slightly pucker.

BRALLOVSKY
It was an electro-static build-
up of some kind. We will probably

ORLOV watches him intently.

Are you catching my drifc?

(Pause)
So here we are...nine years later

JUPITER is almost che entire sky now. It is a sight of
such extreme violence...chat it cannot be called beautiful.

Furious swirls of methane, ammonia, hydrogen and helium...
form ject screams of tans and yellows. They slalom through
white tornadoes or enormous alcitudes...that juts outward
like furious pillars. They flow over titanic crimson seas

When the first group of scienciscs huddled together in
the New Mexico dawn, and wacched che first nuclear
explosion...chey became speechless. They all knew they
had seen something, that perhaps human beings weren'c
supposed co see. Some of them cried. That is what
JUPITER looks like from this proximicy. It is simply
too vast...and is composed of too much force, for us to
comprehend. Ic is on another scale.

FLOYD (V.0.)

Dear Caroline. By the cime you
et this message...I will either
fe a headline on the evening news
tight after the Central American
erisis...or I'll be fine. Either
way...what I have to say to you

.--isn't moot.

The LEONOV is heading towards this inferno. It is
silhouetted against the yellow and orange swirls. Ic
looks like a fragile fishy skeleton.

FLOYD (V.0.)

(Continuing)
We are about co start the aero-
braking maneuver. I told you
about it once. The theory is...
we will encer the outer layer of
Jupiter's atmosphere act just the
proper angle. The atmosphere
will slow us down...and Jupiter's
gravity will grab hold of us...
and sling shot us around...behind
the dark side...and back towards
where we are now. This will slow
us down...and put us in a gentle
orbit near Io. It's kind of like
running down the street and grabbing
hold of a pole...and swinging back
up the street again. It's all
supposed to work. It's dynamite on
paper. Of course the people who
came up wich the numbers on the
paper aren’t here...chey're back
home hoping they're right. The
problem is that if we hit the
atmosphere at the wrong angle...
we will either disintegrate. r
go bouncing off into space...with-
out enough fuel to ever get back.

(Pause)
So if the numbers are right...and
the contracts haven't cheated on
the structure of the Leonov...
we'll be fine. If not...please
don't let them say too much slop
about me on the news.

and telementry monitors...and reading lights. On the

other side of the corridor...are che washrooms.

FLOYD (V.0.)
They love to eulogize people. Ac
least they'll show photographs of
me when I was thinner.

(Pause)

If the heat shield can't take ic...
or if we enter too acutely...I am
told the end will be quick and pain-
less. That's whac they tell me.

The camera moves down the narrow corridor. All of
the cubicles are empty...except for one at the far end.

FLOYD (V.0.)

I do wane you to know...chac if ic
turns our that somebody's calculator
got stuck...and the numbers turn out
to be wrong...and I wind up as part
of some meteor shower...I want you to

As the camera gets nearer to the far cubicle...we see
that the figure behind the tinted gless is FLOYD. He
is lying on his back...scaring up at the data monitors.

FLOYD (V.0.)

(Continuing)
I know how hard this whole business
is for you and Christopher. There's
a constant dull ache in my heart from
missing you boch. I'm scared right
now...however I'm a lucky man. In
this brief time up here...I've been
given a glimpse of things I will
never understand, and I will always
be affected by. I can sense the
whole process up here. Itc is so
vast, and so limitless...and we as
a species are so interesting. Presi-
dents and Premiers should see Jupiter
from this proximity. Then they
would realize how petty and furile it

The buffecing is becoming more violent. The crew is too busy

EUROPA is a cold crescenc behind JUPITER. The brownish
fissure lines are still visible, except hard to distinguish.

It is IO boiling in the foreground. The LEONOV is only a few
thousand kilometers from the surface...and the sight is truly
terrifying.

10 is a caludron of volcanic sulphur. The surface exposed to
the sunlight is a brilliance rust color...with dazk brown
fingersof molcen sulfur dripping from the volcanic peaks.

The dark side periodically explodes in a yellow flash...as
the flux cube linking I0 to JUPITER overloads with electrical
energy...and discharges in protest.

A volcano has erupted on the terminator. A huge , dirty

cloud is expanding upward...climbing inco che sunight. It

looks as if it is sure to devour the LEONOV.

The deflector plates swing out over the engine exhausts.

The outboard chruscers are fired in an angry blue-white

In is one of those summer mornings in FLORIDA. ..when there
is no change between night and day, except for the fact thac
somebody turned che lights on. The temperature never got
below 80 at night. Everrone without air conditioning had cto
choose between being devoured by mosquites if they left
their windows open...or being saure'd by the heat if they
kept the windows closed. Everyone chose the mosquitos...
and a chance of a quart of damp air.

Screet...or any other number on Magnolia Screer. Ic is a
modest single story house...in the middle of a row of

She is a woman in her early forties. Underneath her ex-

woman refuse to go away. She is sitting in a small den-

and a lot of photographs on the wall.

Many of the photographs are of DAVID BOWMAN.

A commercial is playing on the television sec. It is

BOWMAN
Hello, Betty.

ELIZABETH FERNANDEZ has watched the metamorphosis on the
Screen almost unconsciously. The sound of BOWMAN's voice
is what jolts her back to reality. She gapes at the screen
with terror filled eyes.

BOWMAN

She is trying to sore ouc in an instant, if this is a dream
wea practical joke of some kind...or if ic is real. There
is something about the voice that tells her this is not a

BOWMAN

She picks up the small remote channel changer. She presses
the button. The channel indicator on the television set
indicates she is switching from channel two to channel three.

proper forn...and stay there. Aas he changes...his voice
becomes less distorted. The man standing in the Pod Bay
now is DAVID BOWMAN...wearing the red space suic.

BOWMAN
I've been...allowed...to give you
this warning. You must leave here

FLOYD
Allowed? By who?

BOWMAN
I can'c explain.

He walks across the Pod Bay. He stops at HAL's console.
His look at HAL is one of nostalgia. He reaches out to
touch HAL.

The hand that rests on HAL is 90 years old. .with yellowed
fingernails...and jagged blue veins bulging under the wrinkled,
liver-spocted skin.

The old man has DAVID BOWMAN's face. A thin, dry, white
fringe of hair is all chat remains on his scalp. The mouth
is puckered from a loss of teeth. He is wearing a night shirt.
When he speaks...ict is BOWMAN's voice...except ic is terrib:
distorted...as if ic is very far away.

 

BOWMAN
Something is going to happen.

Jupiter becomes a corona around the black center. Then the light goes out.
It is no more.

There is a blinding flash...it is of a size and brilliance that no one has ever
seen. As the circle of light radiates outward...the leading edge is almost green-
white. Purples and lavenders mix with yellows at the center...which is becoming
translucent, A ball of fire shines through the center. A Nova has occured. A
small sun has been bern.

The leading edge of the shock wave resembles the dreadful wave of heat and light
of a nuclear explosion. It begins to loose intensity as it radiates outward from
the new sun.

DISCOVERY is like a row boat in a tidal wave of light. When the wave passes...
DISCOVERY fs gone.

They have all watched the occurence on the monitor. The hysterical bellowing
of the engines and vibrating hull of the spacecraft are deafening.

FLOYD sees that the shock wave is going to overtake them. It fs simply a matter
of how much longer the engines can burn what is left of the fuel...and if they
are far enough away when it hits...so that fs will have dissipated.

An incredible light blasts through the portholes... flooding the bridge with
blinding shafts of biue white. KIRBUK and SVETLANOV turn their heads away
just in time...or they would Probably never be able to see again.

The impact throws the LEONOV foward. Parts of the overhead conduiting break
loose...and sparks fly from the Tow ceiling. It is like a small submarine in
a massive depth charge attack.

The ice begins to melt. The craggy glaciers grow smooth...as they start to
sink into the surface. The ice becomes water. Oceans take the place of the
forbidding ice.

Through the rippling water,..tiny fingers of green begin to reach up towards
the comfort of the sun...as the plant life that has been hiding under the ice
«eds liberated. :

From a distance...we see the new sun...and Io...and the wonderous EUROPA...
which {s becoming tropical. The moons look like they are huddling together...
finally receiving warmth in the coldness of deep space.
