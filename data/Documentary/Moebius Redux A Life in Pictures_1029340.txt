THE RUMBLE OF THUNDER ... THE SCREEN A SWIRL OF STRANGE
IMAGES AS IF WE'RE IN THE VORTEX OF AN EXPLODING QUASAR IN
DEEP SPACE AS BIZARRE SPLASHES OF SHAPES AND COLORS OVERLAP
AND FOLD INTO EACH OTHER UNTIL - OUR SENSES RECOIL FROM AN
EAR-SPLITTING SHRIEK OF METAL RIPPING METAL and then ...

A nearsighted 9-year old BOY stops squinting, puts on his
thick glasses, and things come into focus as ---

INT. NEW YORK CITY SUBWAY TRAIN

RICHIE TUPELO, private school blazer, moves towards the
lights reflecting off the dirty front window of the express
curving through an underground tunnel. As he presses his face
to the shaking, rattling front window ---

RICHIE'S POV -

- silvery tracks and dark tunnel walls hurl themselves at the
train - green lights all the way as the train rumbles across
a spiderweb of tracks and enters an even darker tunnel - a
cheap thrill ride for any kid through a parallel dimension
beneath the city streets.

REVERSE ANGLE - RICHIE AT THE WINDOW

behind him the GRAFFITI-SPLASHED SUBWAY CAR is packed with men
in power suits, women with Farah Fawcett hair and leg warmers,
and kids wearing Air Jordan - it's the 1980's. Richie presses

closer to the dirt-smeared window. WE SEE: he hides a penknife
- a private school punk - and is carving his initials into the
shaking front door. Forming the "R" - the train SHUDDERS - the
train SCREECHING as he presses down to form the "T”.

INSIDE THE MOTORMAN'S COMPARTMENT NEXT TO TUPELO

---is THE MOTORMAN: 32, bushy moustache, big hair puffing out
of his Transit Authority cap - watching his station-marks as he
enters 42nd Street station and expertly slows the train, mating
the front of the lead car with the end of the platform. The
train stops. At that instant ---

THE MOTORMAN SLAMS OPEN THE COMPARTMENT DOOR -
--- and LAUNCHES out at Richie ---

MOTORMAN
You little shit!

Richie runs for the now-opened passenger doors --- but so
many people are now flooding in that there's no way out - the
motorman gets a finger on Richie's collar - but Richie twists
and breaks away - runs through the crowd to the back door -
the angry motorman in pursuit ---

MOTORMAN (CONT'D)

Grab that private school son-of-a-

bitch!
Richie yanks open the door that leads to the next car.
BETWEEN THE CARS
Richie missteps, falls between the metal plates - TERROR! -
if the train's moving his leg is cut off now - he pulls open
the door to the next car, the motorman reaching for him ---
IN THE NEXT CAR
Richie swats away the hand, dashes off the train.

INT. 42ND STREET STATION

Richie rushes upstairs. Motorman does not follow. The conduct-—
or signals from the middle car: we have a train to move!

INT. THE FRONT CAR

The motorman swings back behind the controls. He eases the
throttle, train moves into the tunnel. The motorman glances at
the fresh "RT" scar on his front door. As if to a girlfriend:

MOTORMAN
Sorry.

THE CAMERA PANS FROM the "RT" graffiti to the motorman's
name tag: SOLJAK.

DISSOLVE TO:
20 YEARS LATER ...
CLOSE SHOT - AN EXPLOSION OF SPARKS

--- as a WELDER connects two lengths of steel. The white-hot
streams of light REFLECT OFF ---

--- that same old SOLJAK motorman's name tag, pitted and
browned with age - pinned to the white shirt of ---

MICHAEL SOLJAK,

his hair now short. No more moustache. He's put on weight,
but Soljak is the blue collar guy who made good - having
worked his way up from motorman to the chief operations
officer of the Brooklyn Division. We are in

A SUBWAY TUNNEL UNDER CONSTRUCTION

--- jackhammers pounding, workers shouting, rainbows of weld-
ing sparks - as Soljak gives a tour of this underworld to
BOB, a NY Post reporter ---

SOLJAK
The O-Line Shuttle. 18 years in
the making. A shuttle line tying
together all the threads of all
842 miles of the New York City
subway system. I was here when
this tunnel was still bedrock.

BOB THE REPORTER
When will the final rails actually
be connected together?

SOLJAK

You mean like "in the old days" in
Utah?

(mimics hammering a spike)
The celebration’s at City Hall
tomorrow, Mayor’s gonna be there,
gonna be some party. But the
actual connection: later today.

TERRELL WU, Soljak’s assistant, interrupts. Always interrupts:

TERRELL
Chief ----

SOLJAK
--- as long as I have no distractions.

A CIVIL ENGINEER shows Soljak a blueprint. As he studies it---
TERRELL
You wanted me to notify you ---
the other thing.
Soljak okays the blueprint. To Bob the reporter:
SOLJAK
Two o'clock this afternoon it's finished.
Six o'clock tomorrow night - the party.

Soljak heads for a work train. Terrell scrambles after him:
TERRELL
You told me to tell you --- you didn't
say you were going! No Chief, no ---

INT. SUBWAY MAINTENANCE SHOP, BROOKLYN - DAY

Even louder NOISE. A train barn where subway cars are repaired,
refitted, cleaned. Soljak watches a line of older cars being
assembled into a train - cars from the 1970’s and ‘80's. Is
this some sort of Historic Celebration train? Bumpers slam
together. Couplers connect. A SHOP BOSS counts off the cars:

SHOP BOSS
Six --- seven --- eight ---

The shop boss looks to Soljak. No smile. Shop boss understands.

SHOP BOSS (CONT’D)
I hate this part of the job.

The shop boss smacks the side of Car #8686 - the last car.

SHOP BOSS (CONT’D)
(to mechanic)
Cut it here. Leave this one behind.

MECHANIC
But ---

SHOP BOSS
Just do it.

The mechanic uncouples the last car. Shop Boss to Soljak:

SHOP BOSS (CONT’D)
Want me to stash it somewhere?
Hell, I’1l even hitch it up and
send it out for a last ride.

Soljak likes that idea. The shop boss turns a key, the
to the last car open. Soljak climbs up into car #8686.

INT. CAR #8686 - DAY

Soljak peers into his old control compartment, touches
cracked leather seat, the old-style control throttles.

SOLJAK
Always so damn hot in here. Hard
to imagine I used to live in
this box five days a week.

doors

the
SHOP BOSS
Guess you don't miss being a motorman.

A low rumble, the rest of the train that was attached to

#8686 is moving away. Soljak drops the front window, watches
the rest of his train disappear into a tunnel. Something for-
boding about this - its tail-end streaked with tears of rust.

SOLJAK
(as the old train disappears)
Running trains, working in this cage,
do I miss it? --- Everyday.

Then he notices a faded, almost-invisible scar in the front
door's steel: those initials --- "RT."

CLOSE SHOT - SCHOOL BLACKBOARD - DAY

A hand writes the letter R - leaves a space - writes: T.
Fills in the rest: R-ichard T-upelo. PULL BACK TO REVEAL:

MEDIUM SHOT —- RICHARD TUPELO (R.T.) - DAY

RICHARD TUPELO is now a handsome 29-year old teacher in blue
blazer and polo shirt - with the same mischievous swagger,
and those same style glasses as when he was 9. He faces his
class with confidence and ease.

TUPELO
My name is Richard Tupelo, and today
you're going to forget everything
you ever thought you knew ---

INT. THE CLASSROOM - DAY

REVEAL: no he's not teaching at Harvard, or at some small
liberal arts haven - he's in the worst high school in the
Bronx: slackers, wannabe gangsters, a smattering of tough
Albanian immigrants ... and those are the good kids. This

is not honorable volunteer work. Richard Tupelo does not want
to be here. While Soljak might be the working class guy who
made good, Tupelo is the rich kid whose life derailed.

TUPELO (CONT’D)
Since I'm just subbing today, and none
of you will ever see me again, let's
all maybe try to have some fun.

(This gets some attention -—

some, very little, but some)
Tell me one thing you've been taught
this year that you don't believe.

(no one responds)
(MORE )
TUPELO (CONT’D)
Okay, I'll tell you something I don't
believe: I don't believe anything

in this room is real.

INT. TRAIN TUNNEL - DAY

That train of old rusted subway cars passes from darkness
into daylight.

EXT. BROOKLYN TRAIN YARD —- DAY

The old train moves through acres of shiny new subway trains
being readied for their runs.

EXT. BARGE PIER - DAY

The old train continues onto a barge waiting at the pier,
joining dozens of other old subway cars already packed onto
the barge - and chained together. Perhaps these venerable
cars are heading for use in some other town.

EXT. EAST RIVER - DAY

Tugs pulls the barge into New York Harbor: subway cars
floating past Manhattan, past The Statue of Liberty.

INT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY

BAM! Tupelo crashes into a wall, bounces off, and then slams
again against a wall - is he being beaten up by the students?
REVEAL: he's throwing himself against the wall, again and again.
This gets a few kids' attention. He gives himself a rest:

TUPELO (CONT’D)
Okay, so, if you learn one thing in
science learn this: everything in
the world is made up of atoms, tiny
specks of matter that you can't

see but which make up everything.

ALBANIAN KID
I don't understand.

TUPELO
This wall is not really hard, it's
made up of trillions of floating
atoms - and it's not "hard" until
I press against it - the atoms in
my body repelled by the atoms in
the wall and if I pressed against
this wall forever, imagine that,
for the history of time ---

(keeps pushing)
(MORE )
TUPELO (CONT'D)
If I lived forever and kept pressing
against this wall there is a possibil-
ity - of a moment - when the atoms
in the wall might suddenly randomly
arrange themselves so I'd go through
the wall. Could happen right now.
Or in a million years. Might never
happen. But it could happen.

SHARONA
Like - you could walk through a wall?

TUPELO
Yeah. But something really, really
different would have to be happening
at just that moment in the universe
to set up those circumstances.

JAMAL
If you went through the wall would
you be on the other side of the
wall, or inside the wall?

TUPELO
Good question. Why aren't you in
some brainiac school instead of
this dung-heap? - and I'm not
joking. Don't like to study?

JAMAL
Life is tough.

TUPELO
Well, kid, the second thing you
need to learn is: as tough as you
think your life is, for someone
else it's even worse.

JAMAL
(ignores that)
If you went through the wall, what
would it look like?

TUPELO
All I know is this: when we leave this
room, pull down the blinds, close the
door, this classroom will not look
like this classroom. This classroom,
when no one's in here, is a swirling
cloud of atoms that form this desk,
this chair, this poster of Martin
Luther King, with colors our eyes
can't process and shapes you can't

(MORE )
TUPELO (CONT'D)
begin to imagine and that's what this
room really looks like until someone
opens the door and looks in - and in
that instant the human eye and the
human brain will turn this swirling
cloud of electrons-molecules-atoms
into what we think of as "real."

The kids are fascinated. Here is a guy who is not scared,
bored, or patronizing to them. Tupelo is a brilliant teacher.

EXT. ATLANTIC OCEAN - DAY

Beyond New York Harbor the barge stops. Tug workers unhook
the chains that secure the old subway cars. The track plat-
form tilts and one by one, each car pulling the next car, THE
SUBWAY CARS PLUNGE OVERBOARD - cries of metal, groans of
steel as the old cars are unceremoniously dumped into the sea
(NOTE: this is actually how they get rid of old subway cars)

UNDERSEA - ATLANTIC OCEAN

The drowning subway cars gasp and spit air as they sink to
become part of an ---

UNDERWATER REEF OF SUBWAY CARS

A sad watery graveyard of forgotten history, silt and muck
rising as each drowning car settles among the other rusting,
barnacle-covered hulks. One subway car comes to rest with
its front end to us. An iridescent glow - its front door,
motorman's window, headlights and identification plaque
look like the face of a skull. Bubbles rise from its

"mouth" and "nostrils." It looks --- very unhappy.

EXT. CITY PLAYGROUND - DEKALB AVENUE, BROOKLYN - DAY

Someone else looks very unhappy: RENEE TUPELO, 29 - a nurse,
very pretty in a Vermont-Montreal sort of way - Tupelo’s
wife. She watches mothers push their children on the swings
in a playground. A mother sees Renee. Waves hello. Renee
backs off, heads across the street to Brooklyn Hospital.

INT. SUBWAY INTERCHANGE, BROOKLYN - DAY

Soljak walks through a multi-level station. He loves this
grand mechanism: trains on three levels moving in and out of
tunnels and platforms - like a giant clockwork at the heart
of the city. Soljak pauses to watch - it’s as if he owns
this place - and THROUGH HIS EYES ---

WE SEE WHAT SOLJAK KNOWS:
ELECTRICITY SURGING ALONG THE MULTIPLE TRACKS’ THIRD RAILS

THE “SHOES” UNDERNEATH THE TRAINS PICKING UP THE CURRENT AND
POWERING THE TRAINS AS --—

SIGNAL LIGHTS COORDINATE WITH SWITCHES--——

TRACK SWITCHES SHIFTING TRAINS ACROSS TRACK CROSSOVERS
RODENT-CHEWED, CLOTH-COVERED WIRING FROM THE 1930'S
CONNECTING ELECTRIC TRACK SENSORS BUILT IN 1904 THAT TRIP
ANCIENT RELAY SWITCHES THAT ILLUMINATE TINY RED LIGHTS ON
METAL TRACK MAPS FROM 1950 IN GRIMY DISPATCH ROOMS -
---INDICATING THAT A TRAIN IS PASSING THROUGH THE SYSTEM AS
STEEL WHEELS FOLLOW THE TRACK, AND WHEN THE TRACK CURVES ---—
WHEEL FLANGES TOUCH THE STEEL RAILS (SPARKS FLY) ---

--- causing that ear-splitting SCREECH known to every one of
the 2 billion subway riders in the world.

ANGLE ON - SOLJAK (BACK TO REALITY)
Still amazed that this grand, decayed, complex machine works.
INT. CLASSROOM, THE BRONX - DAY
Tupelo owns this classroom now - the kids gathered around him
as he demonstrates principles of perception with 3 cups and a
ball - the classic street hustle, expert slight-of-hand ---
TUPELO

Which one's the ball under. You saw

it under Cup #1 - left-right, right

to center, three cups - one has the

ball - which one has the ball?
They're all convinced that ---

THE KIDS
Left one! This one! Number One!

Tupelo lifts cup #1: no ball. Groans, laughs. He shows the
ball under Cup 3, again moves the cups around the table.
10.

TUPELO
We're all seeing the same thing
right? Which one hides the ball?

The kids all yell, call out, pointing to different cups.

JAMAL
You got the ball in your hand.

Tupelo's look: oh yeah? He lifts the first cup. No ball. Puts
the cup back down. Lifts the second cup. No ball. Lifts the
third cup. No ball. He opens his hands: no ball. Huh? Where's
the ball? Points to the first cup.

TUPELO
It's there. Trust me.

Jamal lifts that cup again: now there's a ball there.

TUPELO (CONT'D)
Guess we didn't all see the same
thing. That's the basis of rela-
tivity: our relationship to and
perception of what is happening
defines our sense of what is real.

Tupelo sees past the group around him, notices a scrawny kid
face down on a desk. The kid is wearing a backpack covered with
scribbled note cards. Tupelo looks to the class:

TUPELO (CONT’D)
Okay ---. What's going on there?

ALBANIAN KID
You wanna trip into never-neverland
- that's your tour guide. Lives in
some other world already.

Kids laugh. Tupelo moves to the slumped, apparently sleeping
figure, leans in close to read a card pinned to the backpack:

TUPELO
"Credit reports are good for 7 years
True or False."
(to the class)
I'll take some help from anybody.

JAMAL
We call her TinkerBell.

TUPELO
Her ---?
11.

SHARONA
Teena something. That’s her real name.

JAMAL
Writes down crazy things she reads
on walls, then clips 'em to herself.

Tupelo reads other cards clipped to Tinkerbell:

TUPELO

“If You See Something Say Something”
“Who Will Be Miss Subway?” “WONDER
BREAD” “Cry Then Bell”

(to Jamal)
If I came in here with a forklift,
picked up the desk and her on it,
and dumped her in the middle of a
museum I'd get a "Genius Grant."
Where’s she --- what's her ---?

SHARONA
If we knew that then she wouldn’t
be called “Tinkerbell.”

TUPELO
But she's definitely alive, right?

Jamal shrugs: maybe. Tupelo moves to touch TinkerBell.
Hesitates. Looks to Jamal. Jamal nods: it’s okay to touch.

TUPELO (CONT'D)
Kid --- ?

Tupelo gently touches Tinkerbell’s sleeve ---

AN ANIMAL-LIKE SCREECH AS TINKERBELL INSTANTLY LEAPS TO HER
FEET — SCARING THE HELL OUT OF TUPELO - AND US!

Jamal roars with laughter, knew this would happen. Tinkerbell
- blazing eyes, face like a feral cat - hisses at Tupelo:

TINKERBELL
Don’t touch me!!

AND THEN: THE CLASS BUZZER RINGS!

Tupelo jumps (so do we). Tupelo grabs his books, wants out of
here even faster than the students do. Jamal cuts him off.

JAMAL
You really believe any of what you
told us - that nothing is real?
12.

TUPELO
(on his way out)
Thanks for your little joke.

JAMAL
C'mon, it was funny. Look: she’s okay.

Tinkerbell does not look “okay” - glares at Tupelo.

JAMAL (CONT'D)
Was that true what you said?

TUPELO
Next time your regular teacher
cops a long weekend and they send
me back here I'll let you know.

JAMAL
(genuinely scary)
We can make sure he never shows up.

TUPELO
Who can resist the spirit of young
minds eager for education?

Their eyes lock. Now only Tupelo and Jamal are left in the
classroom - and Tinkerbell, who moves behind Jamal, her
protector. Jamal touches Tupelo's sleeve.

JAMAL
Answer me. I want to know.

TUPELO
Do I really believe everything we see
is some form of illusion that we call
reality, an illusion we may more
accurately understand sometime in the
future? Do I actually believe that --- ?

The Big Question. As Tupelo leans close to answer ---

INT. SUBWAY - DAY

A FLASH of POWER-ENERGY-SPEED as the #3 train rockets downtown.
INT. EXPRESS TRAIN - DAY

Tupelo, rocking with the rhythm, takes this subway world for
granted - believes it will get him home. Steel screeches, harsh

sounds - he ignores them. He looks up at the subway ads:

“Credit reports are good for 7 years -
True or False?"
13.

Hmm - TinkerBell’s quote. And below that ad, the ominous post-—
9/11 police department sign now in every car:

IF YOU SEE SOMETHING SAY SOMETHING.

The train speeds through COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY station. Tupelo’s
lips tighten - bad memories. THE ROARING SUBWAY SOUND BECOMES ---

EXT. BROOKLYN HOSPITAL —- DAY

THE WAIL OF AN AMBULANCE - always some emergency in New York
- but no one on the street reacts. Exiting the hospital:
Renee and two other nurses: her supervisor JUDY, and CARLA.
Renee eyes the playground, Judy pulls her along with them.

NURSE JUDY
We’re going for a drink. And
Renee, this time you’re coming.

RENEE
Fine.

NURSE JUDY
I don’t believe it: she said yes.

RENEE
But it better be a place filled
with loud nasty drunks.

NURSE JUDY
Sorry - I never drink at home.

They head for a local tavern. Renee slows, sees: Tupelo
coming up from a subway entrance. Looking for her.

RENEE
Sorry girls, rain check, okay?

NURSE JUDY
You're ditching us for a guy?

CARLA
Does a husband count as a guy?

RENEE
Next time. I promise.

The friends continue across the street, polite nods to Tupelo
- awkward moment, they know something. Renee smiles at him,
instinct - what a smile, then the smile disappears. Cool:

RENEE (CONT'D)
This is a surprise.
14.

TUPELO
Nice surprise?

She puts her finger to his lips: Shh. Something very deep
going on here. He locks her finger with his finger, moves
it from his lips. Gives her a quick kiss. We notice their
wedding rings - the identical simple bands.

TUPELO (CONT’D)
I had a very strange day. Want to
get some dinner?

RENEE
Let's just go home. That okay?

EXT. BROOKLYN ESPLANADE - EAST RIVER - DAY

Soljak, alone, on the promenade overlooking the harbor,
watches tugboats and barges returning from the sea. The
barges - once carrying old subway cars - are empty.

INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - DAY

Renee and Tupelo wait for a train. Quiet. A steady DRIPPING
from somewhere. He takes her hand. She gazes at the track. A
look as dark as when she was watching those kids in the park.

BANG! BANG! BOOM! - THEY BOTH STARTLE as a DRUMMER seeking dona-
tions starts pounding out a LOUD BEAT on plastic water jugs.

Tupelo puts his arm around the edgy Renee. She rests her head
on his shoulder. She fights back tears ---

RENEE
Richard ---

He fears what might be coming. She begins to speak, then -
surprise - she pulls him into a desperate kiss.

WHOOSH-GROWL - an EXPRESS ROARS through the station as ---
INT. TUNNEL CONSTRUCTION ZONE - DAY
Soljak crunches blueprints, ready to explode:
SOLJAK
What do you mean it's not done?
I left for two hours - it should
have taken ten minutes!
TERRELL

I begged you: Don't leave. You leave,
nothing goes right. If you'd stayed---
15.

SOLJAK
What is the problem?

CIVIL ENGINEER
Wrong joint was delivered.

SOLJAK
Then get the right joint.

TERRELL
It's in Jersey City.

SOLJAK
Goddammit! Finish this now!

CONTRACTOR
(takes a step back)
Can't get delivery ‘til tonight and if
I gotta keep a crew on, gonna cost---

SOLJAK
I don’t care! The Mayor’s flying back
from China for this - and tomorrow is
the best day of my life. If it's not,
it’s gonna be the worst day of yours.
Got that? I've given 30 years to this
system. This is my wife, my family, my
life, and anyone who gets in my way ---

CONTRACTOR
Okay! It'll get done.

INT. BROOKLYN APARTMENT - NIGHT

Renee pulls on jeans. Washes her face. Looks away from the
mirror. Sad - wishes she wasn’t. Tupelo - they’ve just made
love - watches her from the bed. Love. Oldies on the radio.

RENEE
Never told me about your day.

TUPELO
Got to find something else to do.

RENEE
What about the thing in Vegas?

On the living room table: schematic drawings and a model of a
car on a platform surrounded by shards of mirrors.

TUPELO
He just needs the trick. Doesn't
need me to build it.
16.

RENEE
Still, you should go out there.

TUPELO
He'll invite us both out for
the opening.

RENEE
But you need a vacation ---
(softly, sweetly)
From me.

Tupelo, out of bed, wraps himself in the sheet, follows her
into the living room.

TUPELO
Don't say that, please.

RENEE
How'd your cousin ever get into magic?

We realize what he’s building is a miniature Vegas stage illusion.

TUPELO
It's not that different from physics.

On the radio the Go-Go's sing “Our Lips Are Sealed.” Tupelo and
Renee glance at each other - some old joke between them - she
can’t stay sad. As the Go-Go’s sing their garbled chorus ‘Our
Lips Are Sealed...’ Renee playfully sings misheard lyrics:

RENEE
“Alex the Seal ---"

TUPELO
See? - my version is better. Any-
way, that’s what it sounds like.

The song keeps playing - brightens the room, and them ---

RENEE
Be honest - you didn’t think those
were the words. The song is “Our
Lips are Sealed" so it’s obvious---

TUPELO
Obvious maybe to a girl.

RENEE
What would “Alex the Seal” mean?

TUPELO
Something very heavy, and very deep.
17.

RENEE
(jumps and sings)
“Alex the Seal, Alex the Seal”---

Her voice drifts. Tupelo SEES IN THE MIRRORS: Renee looking
across the apartment at a locked door. The sadness returns.

TUPELO
(goes to her)
We can't keep it closed forever.

RENEE

It's like it all never happened.
TUPELO

Let me - I can pack her things.
RENEE

Not yet.
TUPELO

She had a beautiful life. She did.
That should be the memory.

Renee doesn’t respond. Goes to the locked door. Touches it.

TUPELO (CONT’D)
Let me take care of everything.
While you're at work.

RENEE
I don't want that. Not until you---.

TUPELO
What? See things your way?

RENEE
She had a terrible life. Just
agree with me, okay? I need that.

TUPELO
We're allowed to handle things dif-
ferently.

RENEE

I know. We handle things differently -
(touches his shoulder)
--- and that's what going to kill us.

She goes back into their bedroom. Closes that door. Not a
slam, just a very chilling CLICK. Tupelo now left alone.
He looks at that first door. CAMERA MOVES TOWARDS the dark
18.

keyhole, taking us closer, closer - TENSION BUILDS and just
when we could see through the hole and into the other side ---

SCREAM-SCREECH-WHOOSH-GROWL ---—
INT. SUBWAY STATION - BROOKLYN - DAY

--- a subway train BLASTS out of a dark tunnel and ROARS into
the station. Tupelo and Renee dash down the steps to catch it.

INT. OLD SUBWAY CAR - MOVING - DAY

Tupelo and Renee, standing in the noisy, surprisingly old
subway car - seems neither slept last night. It’s early,
only a dozen other PASSENGERS are in their car including:

A young EXEC reading Advertising Age ... a CHINESE KITCHEN
WORKER ... an ART STUDENT ... a red-haired MODEL with no
makeup reading Vogue ... a FAT GUY with court papers ...
three scattered HOMELESS GUYS ... and yet another SUBWAY
DRUMMER pounding away on a plastic container.

Renee's tense. Tupelo tries to calm her:

TUPELO
Alex the Seal.

She forces a weak smile, remembers something, checks her bag.

RENEE
Forgot my keys.

TUPELO
I'm just filing hours today, and
sending that design to my cousin.
I'll be home when you get home.

Something grabs Tupelo's pant cuff. A rat? - Tupelo pulls
away - looks down: it's a little KID IN A STROLLER. Tupelo
goofs with the kid. The kid laughs.

RENEE
You would have been a great father.
TUPELO
I was a great father.
RENEE
Six weeks.
TUPELO

For six weeks I was a great father.
And maybe I'll get another chance.
19.

RENEE
Just like that?

TUPELO
We can try.

What he said burns her. He touches her, wants her happy.
Instead:

RENEE

We need to be away from each other.
TUPELO

Renee ---
RENEE

When the train stops I need to be alone.
TUPELO

Renee ---
RENEE

Get off the train or I will ---

SCREAM OF STEEL WHEELS AGAINST STEEL TRACK as the train
enters the next station.

CONDUCTOR’S VOICE
Bergen Street. Next stop Atlantic Avenue.

IN THE STATION

Train doors open. Mother with kid exits. Tupelo gets off. They
were in the rear car. From the platform Tupelo looks back at
Renee. She can't believe what just happened - now feels awful,
reaches her hand to him, truly loves him, WANTS HIM BACK, but---

CONDUCTOR’S VOICE
Stand clear of the closing doors.

TRAIN DOORS SLAM SHUT.

Tupelo smacks the door with his hand - wants in. Too late.
Train CHUNKS, starts to move.

ON THE TRAIN -
Renee rushes to the rear window as the train pulls away.
ON THE PLATFORM -

Tupelo raises a hand to her when ---
20.

SLAM! --- A RAPID-FIRE COLLAGE OF HORRIFYING IMAGES:

TUPELO IS HIT HARD FROM BEHIND ---

--- stumbles forward AND FALLS INTO THE TRACK PIT

TUPELO CRASHES DOWN ONTO THE TRACKS ---

--- into the muck between steel rails - rats scurry as -
SOMEONE RUNS AWAY -

chasing the train ---

TWO COPS LEAP THE TURNSTILES IN PURSUIT,

chasing a YOUNG PUNK in a black jacket and backpack who
LEAPS ONTO THE BACK OF THE RUSHING-AWAY TRAIN -—

latching onto the rear chains to hold on as---

RENEE - IN THE REAR WINDOW

reacts to seeing Tupelo knocked into the pit, then sees

A WILD CREATURE SUDDENLY LATCHED ONTO THE TRAIN -—

--- a psychotic young face fills the window: TinkerBell.

THE SUBWAY TRAIN —

curves into the dark of the tunnel. The SCREECH of scraping steel.
IN THE TRACK PIT -

Tupelo - feeling in the muck for his glasses, finds them -
THE THIRD RAIL BUZZES WITH ELECTRICITY -

- the main rails beginning to vibrate - Tupelo blinks to get
his bearings - am I alive? am I dead? - his glasses filthy,
he seems in some timeless other dimension of the city, when---
HE IS THRUST FORWARD!

HIS LEGS AND FEET PULLED THROUGH THE MUCK as he’s GRABBED by
the cops and a FARE CLERK who pull him up out of the pit.

A MONTAGE OF DISORIENTING FACES:

COP 1 (OFFICER GARRETT)
You okay?
21.

TUPELO
My wife's on the train. Is she ---?

COP 2
Get a look at who did it?

TUPELO
What happened?

OFFICER GARRETT
You got pushed onto the tracks.

THE NEXT TRAIN ROARS INTO THE STATION - at this hour trains
pull into stations every minute. Had Tupelo stayed in the pit
he's dead now. The cop’s on his intercom:

OFFICER GARRETT (CONT'D)
Stop the #3 coming into Atlantic Avenue -
we got a Code 2-40 riding the back!

ON THE TRAIN - MOVING - IN THE TUNNEL

A FLASH OF IMAGES as Renee and Tinkerbell's eyes meet through
the back door's scratched glass. Renee saw her bump Tupelo
onto the tracks - wants to kill her - tries to get at her -
but the door is locked ---

--- and TinkerBell’s face is now so vulnerable it breaks your
heart --- and now Renee sees her as a scared child hanging
onto the back of a speeding train - now wants to help --- BUT:
A LOOK OF ANIMAL HORROR

comes over TinkerBell's face as ---

TINKERBELL'S POV: INSIDE THE SPEEDING SUBWAY CAR -—

--- a TORNADO-LIKE STORM OF BARELY-IMAGINED COLORS AND
SHAPES POURS IN FROM THE FORWARD CARS AND IS ---

RUSHING TOWARDS US ---—

--- towards the unaware Renee - is this real or some
psychotic Tinkerbell vision? - the storm of FRIGHTENING
SHAPES and COLORS about to overtake Renee when ---

INT. ATLANTIC AVENUE STATION —- DAY

Commuters wait impatiently for the #3 train. Hear the SCREECH
and ROAR as flanges hit rails in the curving tunnel --- the
RUMBLE of the train brings some waiting commuters closer to
the edge of the platform while others back away and then ---
22.

WHOOSH -- A POWERFUL STORM OF WIND

--- blasts through the station - pulling newspapers out of
hands, tossing hats, sending magazines from the news-kiosk
flying --- and just as quickly disappears down the tunnel.
Lots of "what the fuck ---?-'s --- but before there's a
consensus of "what the fuck?" did just happen---

THE NEXT TRAIN PULLS INTO THE STATION

It's rush hour - and people are late - so everyone on the
platform just gets on this next train - and this train
leaves - and the platform is now empty ---

AS COPS RUSH DOWN ONTO THE PLATFORM --——

--- to find: no train, no waiting passengers, no TinkerBell,
only a Pakistani news-seller picking up the newspapers and Lotto
tickets blown from his kiosk by the mysterious gust of wind.

INT. TUNNEL CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY
A SEARING BLAST OF LIGHT. The Contractor turns to Soljak:

CONTRACTOR
It's done.

Soljak looks over to workers making the final welds on the
shuttle track. The station clock: 6:23. A gruff whisper:

SOLJAK
Done. First time in 112 years: the
entire tangle of the New York City
Subway System is tied together ---

Soljak does not seem triumphant. More an "is that all there
is?" expression as he turns to Bob the Reporter who holds out
a digital recorder to capture Soljak's every word:

SOLJAK (CONT'D)
--- all 25 different lines, all 468
stations, and now it's all hooked
together in one big knot - and we did
it. Bravo. But if I ask for one more
fire extinguisher or to change some
wiring from 1930 I still need twenty
pages of paperwork. The people deserve
better, the workers deserve better,
and this old system deserves better.

A hand grabs Bob's recording device, a hand that belongs to
23.

MICHELLE MURPHY, a hot-looking 30ish corporate-type---

MICHELLE MURPHY

What the Chief of Operations, Brooklyn
Division - who is scheduled to retire
this week, I believe - means to say is
that when he started things were very
different - very simple - and now
we're in the 21st Century.

(takes the reporter's hand)
Michelle Murphy - mayor's office.

She takes the digital recorder away from Bob. Bob reacts.

MICHELLE MURPHY (CONT’D)
Didn't you still want that interview
with the Mayor on Thursday?

BOB THE REPORTER
I never - I have an interview with
the mayor?
(likes that)
Let me show you how to erase that.

As Bob the Reporter erases Soljak's quote from the digital
recorder, Terrell pulls Sojak aside:

TERRELL
Uh Chief: we got a problem at Bergen
Street Station.

INT. BERGEN STREET STATION - DAY

The northbound platform and local track has been closed.
Tupelo, emergency blanket over his shoulders, fumbles with
his cell phone as OFFICER GARRETT questions him.

OFFICER GARRETT
You said you’re a teacher - the
creep who pushed you was a kid.
Any reason for a kid to push you?

Tupelo, somewhat in shock, ignores that, his mind elsewhere:

TUPELO
I had a little fight with my wife,
got off the train, then I tried to
get back on and next thing I'm ---
I need to call her - tell her I’m
okay - she must have gotten off at
the next stop - can you call her?
24.

OFFICER GARRETT
No, but if she got off at Atlantic
she’1l be back here in a minute.
But the kid who pushed you ---

(reading his notes)

--- 'bout this high, maybe 15 -
grabbed a can of yellow spray
paint out of a hardware store on
Bergen street, we were chasing
her, jumped the turnstile ---

TUPELO
So you were chasing him? He wasn't
trying to kill me. He bumped me?
It was an accident?

OFFICER GARRETT
Not “him” - “her.”

TUPELO
Her?

OFFICER GARRETT
And her jacket and backpack: cover-
ed with all kinds of crazy weird
notes. Can you help me out here?

TUPELO
Tinkerbell?

Officer Garrett smiles politely. EMS GUYS arrive with med
kit, pull on gloves.

EMS DUDE
This the guy? Sir, look into this
light. Can you tell me your name?

TUPELO
Richard Tupelo.

A southbound train BLASTS in from the opposite direction.
Stops across the tracks at the opposite platform. Tupelo
stands. Sees people get off. Train leaves. No Renee.

OFFICER GARRETT
Maybe she didn’t see what happened.

TUPELO
Can someone take me to the Hospital
Center? She works there.
25.

EMS DUDE
(to the cop)
All right with you, we done here?

OFFICER GARRETT
Yeah, what the hell, the guy’s
half wacko, can’t tell us any-
thing, besides ---
(points to surveillance cam)
We got it all on tape.

The southbound ROARS out of the station - becoming a SMEAR of
light and color disappearing into the tunnel darkness.

INT. PEDIATRICS WARD, BROOKLYN HOSPITAL CENTER - DAY

Where Renee works. Busy, under-staffed, and supervisor Nurse
Judy has lost her patience with Tupelo.

TUPELO
I called home, she’s not there.
Called her mother, not there.

NURSE JUDY
For the third time, Richard, she's
not here - and whatever you two
need to work out, I understand,
but I am none too happy that she
hasn’t shown up for work. Okay?

TUPELO
(spots the friend)
Carla - did you see her? You take
the same train, right?

CARLA
I came in early today.

NURSE JUDY
Richard, she is not here! We're
not hiding her. And you look like
shit - go get yourself clean!

EMS DUDE
Mr. Tupelo, you need to come with us.

On the marker board that lists nurses working this shift
Renee’s name is being erased. AS HER NAME DISAPPEARS ---
QUICK INTERCUTS:

INT. MANHATTAN AD AGENCY - DAY

A MESSENGER leaves documents on the desk of an empty cubicle,
26.

the exec who should be here hasn’t shown for work. No biggie.
INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - DAY

The owner is screaming in Chinese, pointing to a sink filled
with pots. We only understand: “no dishwasher.”

INT. ART SCHOOL CLASS - DAY
Students at work at their easels. One easel is empty.

TEACHER
Where’s Claire? New boyfriend?

INT. BROOKLYN TRAFFIC COURT - DAY
Packed, hellish. The JUDGE moves through cases quickly.
JUDGE
Mister Mizrahi not with us this
morning? Judgement against him.
Next case ---
INT. FASHION SHOOT - DAY
TWO MODELS - one Blonde, one Black - and one crazed PHOTOGRAPHER.
PHOTOGRAPHER
She always late! I don’t need her.
Get me a redhead. Any redhead
EXT. 34TH STREET POST OFFICE - DAY
One homeless guys barks at another who holds a DONATION sign.

HOMELESS GUY
Where’s Slim? This is his spot.

THROUGHOUT A CITY OF TEN MILLION ---

Several dozen random people at random locations are missing,
absent, or late. But no reason for panic. Yet.

INT. BERGEN STREET STATION - DAY

Cops, transit officials and investigators, reporters, a guy on a
ladder takes down a surveillance camera. Soljak looks to heaven
(a drippy ceiling), his voice loud enough for everyone to hear:

SOLJAK
May we re-open this station? I’ve
been re-routing trains for two
hours which which has backed up
(MORE )
27.

SOLJAK (CONT'D)
my system for five hours. Read the
signs, people: STAY BACK FROM THE
TRACKS! So some jerk can’t read,
fell in, and then he climbed out
- so nothing happened!

DETECTIVE MARASCHINO
Attempted Murder. He was pushed.

SOLJAK
If he was pushed find who pushed him.
You got all your new TV cameras so go
watch TV. Let me get this system back
on schedule. Somebody. Please.

No one wants to make a decision. Until she appears:

MICHELLE MURPHY
Let's get this station re-opened.

OFFICER GARRETT
(explains to the detective)
Mayor's Director of Operations, and
campaign director --- a lotta juice.

SOLJAK
Thank you, Michelle.

She nods like a queen, taps her watch:

MICHELLE MURPHY
The mayor’s plane lands in four
hours and we have a very important
evening so let’s not have any more
screw ups. Is that clear Mr. Soljak?

SOLJAK
I didn’t fall on the tracks.

MICHELLE MURPHY
You're starting to look like you
did. Get some sleep. Go home.

SOLJAK
This is my home.

MICHELLE MURPHY
Not for long, but if you want that
big cushy consultant job when you
retire make sure nothing else gets
in the way today.

She marches away. Terrell whispers to Soljak:
28.

TERRELL
You need to pay attention to what
I've been trying to tell you, Chief
- and please don’t yell at me.

SOLJAK
Then don't tell me things that are
insane. What do you mean a #3 is
missing? Terrell, be very precise:
define the word "missing.

INT. BROOKLYN SUBWAY TUNNELS - DAY

A gloomy spiderweb of tracks and tunnels, one of those spots
where several threads of the system connect. TWO SUBWAY
MAINTENANCE WORKERS - hard hats and orange stiped vests -
are repairing a light signal. Left and right of them SUBWAY
TRAINS, SPARKS FLYING, ROAR PAST THEM in several directions.
These guys barely notice - it's where they work.

MAINTENANCE GUY
Four-hour work order here and it turns
out we just have to change a bulb.

JIMMY THE HELPER
So we take the rest of the day off?

MAINTENANCE GUY
No. We don't take the rest of the
day off. And next time you come to
work stinking of beer I'm writing
you up. Get me a #28 bulb.

Jimmy the Helper heads down the track to a work kit. He
stops. Senses something. The switches that run parallel to
the track are starting to click. He turns to his boss.

JIMMY THE HELPER
Uh, this track is shut down now, right?

MAINTENANCE GUY
Get me the bulb!

JIMMY THE HELPER
Boss - the switches are flicking.

MAINTENANCE GUY
What’s wrong with you? The track’s
shut down, its been down for 2 hours.

JIMMY THE HELPER
Check this out, boss. It's humming.
29.

The maintenance guy, now even more annoyed, steps down from
his ladder onto the track bed. Sees - hears - the action of
the pre-1940's switches clicking along the track. Snaps his
walkie-talkie off his belt. SUDDENLY - BEHIND HIM ---

THE SIGNAL BOX HE WAS WORKING ON --- EXPLODES!

Showering him with sparks. He winces, looks at the box,
looks at Jimmy the Helper.

MAINTENANCE GUY
That's not possible. The power is off.

ALL AROUND THEM TRAINS ---
--- KEEP SCREECHING IN AND OUT OF TUNNELS ON THE CRISS-—
CROSSING AND PARALLEL WEB OF TRACKS --- as the maintenance
guy barks into his walkie-talkie:
MAINTENANCE GUY (CONT’D)
Jackson! Track 18 DeKalb Avenue is shut
down, right?
(a garble of static)
Fucking equipment! Jackson!

Maintenance Guy and his helper can FEEL the power surging
through the stretch of track they stand on ---

SWITCHES FLICKING FASTER ---
--- SIGNAL LIGHTS SNAPPING ON-AND-OFF LIKE STROBES:
RED-YELLOW-GREEN --—
--- RED-YELLOW-GREEN ---
FROM THE DARK TUNNEL OF TRACK 18 ---
THEY (AND WE) FEEL THE POWER OF AN ONCOMING TRAIN ---
--- they look to each other - there's no train there - but
the RUMBLING THROB OF POWER GROWS CLOSER, LOUDER - THE SCREECH!
- and THEY FEEL AN ON-RUSHING SURGE OF AIR PRESSURE ---
MAINTENANCE GUY (CONT’D)
What the --- get off the track ---
GET OFF THE TRACK!!!
JIMMY THE HELPER DIVES TO THE RIGHT as---
THE MAINTENANCE GUY LEAPS TO THE LEFT ---

--- onto the empty Track 19 ----
30.

WHERE HE IS INSTANTLY SMASHED/CRUSHED BY AN EXPRESS TRAIN ---
--- POWERING AROUND THE CURVE OF TRACK 19
ANGLE ON: JIMMY THE HELPER

Wide-eyed horror as he sees THE SCREECHING EXPRESS TEARING
HIS BOSS TO SHREDS ---

--- and then Jimmy FEELS a POWERFUL CURRENT OF TORNADO-WIND
FLYING PAST HIM ---

--- disappearing into the darkness - and then all those
strobing signal lights on Track 18 instantly go dark.

The clicking of signals stops. The tunnel falls silent ---
except for Jimmy the Helper's SCREAM!

EXT. ATLANTIC OCEAN FLOOR - THE SUBWAY REEF - DAY

A deep, angry undersea sound. The drowned old subway cars
shift and settle among the debris of a hundred years of
discarded cars, tugboats, machines and technology.

EXT. PLAYGROUND - HOSPITAL CENTER, BROOKLYN - DAY

By now the subway world should seem the norm with it's dark
tunnels and tiled passageways lit by yellow and florescent
light - and the world above the subway - the surface world -—
should seem almost too bright, too crisp, almost surreal.

Tupelo EXITS THE HOSPITAL. Sees the playground. Heads for it,
catches the eye of a mother pushing her kid on a swing.

MOTHER
Hey it’s you. How’s Renee?

TUPELO
It’s tough, you know. Has she been
around? I know she comes here.

MOTHER
I seen her. I don’t think she
should come here though.

TUPELO
When’d you see her? Today?

MOTHER
Yesterday.

TUPELO

What about today? This morning?
31.

No luck. Then: SIRENS grab his attention. EMS and police cars
converge on one of the several Downtown Brooklyn subway
entrances. Tupelo senses trouble, moves quickly across
gridlocked traffic to ---

INT. SUBWAY STATION - DAY

Where the worker was hit by the train. Now crawling with
investigators. Tupelo charges downstairs, is stopped by a cop.

COP
Station's closed.

TUPELO
What's going on?

COP
Please go back upstairs.

Now Soljak and Terrell charge downstairs, passing them.

Tupelo hears

Soljak would

SOLJAK
First a guy on the tracks, a train
missing, now this? Why today? This
is my day.

TUPELO
(follows them)
I'm the guy who fell on the tracks.
This morning. At Bergen Street.

like to strangle Tupelo.

SOLJAK
You look fine, get yourself a drink.

TUPELO
Which train is missing? The #3,
this morning? My wife was on that
train and she's missing too. She's
missing and now the train’s miss-
ing? What the hell’s going on?

SOLJAK
I just got here, pal. There’s been
an accident - nothing to do with
the #3 train. If you would give my
associate a number where you can be
reached I will have someone call you.

TUPELO
What’s that mean: “missing train”?
32.

SOLJAK
It’s not actually --- it’s a cler-
ical error. We’ve been re-directing
trains all morning. Thanks to you.

TUPELO
But where is it?

Sojak, losing patience, points to the iconic NYC Subway map:

SOLJAK

Sir, we got a closed system - we don't
connect to Amtrak or the Long Island
Railroad - so our train is not in the
Hamptons for the weekend, it's not on
its way to Cleveland - it's in the
city somewhere so the farther it gets
from the point it left from the sooner
it's gonna come back. It's in the
system, okay? - and whatever passen-
gers were on it this morning are long
gone and off on their merry ways.

TUPELO
You mean the passengers might have
been dumped somewhere?

Soljak sees: the mangled body being removed from the tracks.
Cops surround the horror-stricken Jimmy the Helper. Then---

THE SOUND OF AN ONCOMING TRAIN - THE SCREECH! --—

Everyone shivers. Jimmy presses back against the wall.
TERROR. Soljak heads towards the action, barking ---

SOLJAK
I thought this track was shut down!

The rumble gets louder. LOUDER. LOUDER ----

SOLJAK (CONT'D)
Everybody off the tracks! What the---!?

Workers and EMS guys scramble onto the platform. As ---
WHOOSH ----
A POWER RUSHES THROUGH THE CENTER TRACKS, kicking up wind

that sends trash flying. But the (0.S.) NOISE is clearly
from the unseen level below, but as THE NOISE passes ---
33.

IN THE CENTER TRACKS

--- a strange metallic shimmering in the air - that just as
quickly disappears. All eyes turn to Soljak. Quick answer:

SOLJAK

Pressure from the IRT, or maybe
the F Train - right beneath us -
kicks up the steel dust - happens.

(to Terrell)
Go downstairs and find out what
train just passed, how fast it
was going, and why.

As Terrell heads for the staircase down to the lower level ---

TUPELO
(to Soljak)
That train that's missing, that my
wife is on. Any contact with the
conductor, the motorman?

SOLJAK
(to anyone)
I thought this guy was gone.

TUPELO
You never took my phone number. Remem-
ber? You were going to call me.

SOLJAK
Somebody take his phone number and
get him out of here ---
(looks around)
Where's Terrell?

STAIRCASE TO LOWER LEVEL

Terrell, charging downstairs, runs into an angry TRANSIT
WORKER rushing upstairs ---

TRANSIT WORKER
What the hell's going on up there?
We just got a shower of plaster and
asbestos raining down on our heads!

TERRELL
We got nothing upstairs! What just
blasted through down here?
34.

TRANSIT WORKER
Down here? Nothing! Just a blast
of wind and that train upstairs
that must have been doing like 80!

TERRELL
But there was no train up there!
It was down here!

They exchange looks.
UPSTAIRS ---
Tupelo gives his number to Soljak. Takes a card from Soljak.

SOLJAK
When you hear from her, and you will,
call me. Now you have to leave.

OFFICER GARRETT
(sees Tupelo)
You're back again?

SOLJAK
Please make him leave.

Officer Garrett escorts Tupelo to the stairs. Tupelo sees a
clock: 9:30 a.m. To the cop:

TUPELO
Officer, help me. My wife’s been
missing for like three hours and---

OFFICER GARRETT
We can’t do anything for 24 hours.
A child - you could report it now,
but she’s an adult - gotta wait.
Trust me: she’1ll show up.

Tupelo takes a last glance around the station, looks across
the four sets of tracks, and freezes --- SEES:

ON THE OPPOSITE PLATFORM ACROSS THE TRACKS ---

--- in the shadows, watching, listening: TINKERBELL (she no
longer has her note-covered backpack). She sees Tupelo see
her, squirrels away into darkness. Tupelo yells:

TUPELO
Stop! That's her!

Soljak, everyone hears - turns - this is good news ---
35.

SOLJAK
Your wife? You see your wife?

TUPELO
No. Not my wife ---
(points, but no one's there)
Tinkerbell!

SOLJAK
“Tinkerbell”!!?? Get that maniac
out of here! And keep him out!

The cop hustles Tupelo up towards the street, but now he
doesn't have to prod him, Tupelo pushes away and races two
steps at a time up to ---

EXT. BROOKLYN INTERSECTION - DAY

Busy, noisy, chaotic, ambulances, police cars, TV news vans
--- normal New York. Yellow CAUTION tape now closes off two
subway entrances. Tupelo looks left, right - subway entrances
for eight different routes at every corner of five converging
streets. But no Tinkerbell. Officer Garrett catches up:

OFFICER GARRETT
The kid who pushed you - you saw her?!

As the cop calls for backup ---

TUPELO SEES TINKERBELL ---

--- just a glimpse, rushing down into a different station
across the avenue. Tupelo wants to follow, but the cop has

his arm.

OFFICER GARRETT (CONT'D)
I need a detailed description.

TUPELO
Let me go, I'll catch her. She was
on that train! Let me talk to her.
I'll find out ---

OFFICER GARRETT
That's our job, not yours.

Tupelo does not want to lose Tinkerbell, breaks away from the
cop and charges across the street ---

OFFICER GARRETT (CONT'D)
Hey! Stop! Get back here!

--- Tupelo dodging cars until ---
36.

TUPELO COLLIDES WITH A TAXI ---

--- goes down hard, rolls, gets back up - hands bruised,
cheek cut - races down into a subway entrance that leads to

INT. HOYT STREET STATION ---

platforms and tunnels that are completely separate from
where the accident took place. Tupelo swipes his Metrocard
at the turnstile - doesn't register - swipes it again ---

HERE COMES A TRAIN INTO THE STATION ---

--- and there's Tinkerbell, pacing, skittish - train stops,
doors open, she gets on, but ---

TUPELO'S ENTRY CARD DOESN'T WORK ---
--- he yells into the noise ---

TUPELO
Hold that train!

--- and here comes the cop! Tupelo leaps the turnstile,
rushes for the train --- a TEENAGER holds the door open ---

Tupelo gets in. TRAIN DOORS CLOSE --- TRAIN STARTS TO MOVE ---
--- the cop chases but it's too late ---
INSIDE THE MOVING TRAIN

Tupelo sees the cop pointing to the train as it pulls away.
The teenager sizes up Tupelo:

TEENAGER
Nice.

Tupelo moves forward through the train to find Tinkerbell.
Gets to the door to the next car. Pulls the handle. Locked.

Sees through the windows into the next car. Crowded. Tupelo
spots Tinkerbell. He readies to make his move as

THE TRAIN PULLS INTO THE NEXT STATION

Tupelo goes to the exit door, nervous energy. Train stops.
Doors open. He bursts out onto ---
37.

THE STATION PLATFORM
Tupelo sees Tinkerbell dash downstairs to a connecting line.
TUPELO PUSHES THROUGH THE CROWD

to catch her, and the way he looks - cut, bruised - people get
out of his way.

HE REACHES THE LOWER PLATFORM

as a train pulls into the station. People pour out onto the
platform. Tinkerbell gets on at the front.

DOORS CLOSING -—
---but Tupelo forces his way in - two cars behind her.
ON THE TRAIN - MOVING

That sign: IF YOU SEE SOMETHING SAY SOMETHING. Blacks, Whites,
Indians, Mexicans, Jews, Chinese - all watching Tupelo.

CONDUCTOR’S VOICE
Next stop Manhattan, Whitehall Street.

Tupelo goes to the subway map beside the door, the car rocking
side-to-side as he traces the yellow-colored route with his
bloody finger - it connects to the red-colored line to The
Bronx at 42nd Street. He knows where she's heading.

Tupelo pushes forward through the other riders to the front
of the swaying car, pulls open the door, steps forward ---

TUPELO - BETWEEN THE CARS - MOVING

--- holding his balance as the train rockets through the long
curving Montague Street East River Subway Tunnel.

Tupelo looks down at the connecting step-plates - sawing at
each other.

He reaches across the step-plates, pulls the door latch to
the next car. CLICK. It’s locked.

THE DOOR BEHIND HIM SLAMS SHUT -

--- now he's between cars. He muscles the forward door - but
it won't open. He starts to retreat back when ---
38.

A SCREECH OF METAL ---

--- as the train curves and brakes apply, SPARKS FLYING as
the train SQUEALS - STEEL WHEELS JAMMING, THE TRAIN JERKING---

THE MOMENTUM CARRYING TUPELO FORWARD ---

--- between the cars, slamming Tupelo into the forward door,
his leg slipping between the step-plates - he pulls his leg
up - the plates SLAM together as ---

THE TRAIN GRINDS TO A STOP -

Tupelo falls to the side into the chain guards, DROPS HIS
GLASSES, catches them, puts them on ---

HIS LENSES FOGGED FROM THE HUMIDITY ---

--- EVERYTHING A STRANGE BLUR as he reaches back to the door
that opens, can't find the handle, gets it, pulls - OPENS,
he stumbles into the car, wipes his glasses, FINDS:

IN THE STALLED SUBWAY TRAIN ---

People are picking themselves off the ground, cursing, find-
ing their spilled belongings when ---

THE GENERATOR SHUTS DOWN ---

--- air conditioning stops. GROANS from the riders. Then:
FLICK-FLICK-FLICK ----

--- one-by-one THE LIGHTS GO OUT IN THE TRAIN plunging all

the cars into DARKNESS. CRIES, MORE CURSES. Tupelo’s eyes
adjust to the GLOW of reflected signal lights from outside the
train: SMEARS of red, yellow, green on the filthy windows ---

--- they’re stalled in a tunnel, this is as bad as it gets.
Usually. But now it gets worse ---

THERE IS A STEADY DRIPPING SOUND NOW ---

--- on the roof of the train from the tunnel ceiling, then ---
A SURGE OF POWER SHAKES THE TRAIN -

--- a HORRIBLE WRENCHING SOUND and ---

THE DOORS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE SUBWAY TRAIN --—
39.

ALL SUDDENLY OPEN! ---

---people who were leaning on the doors tumble towards
darkness, others catch them, pull them back, people crush-
ing closer into the center of the car which is now like
an open aluminum can stalled in the dark tunnel ---

PANIC IN THE TRAIN -
- a fevered announcement from the conductor is so garbled
with static that it only creates more panic. And then, from
somewhere at the back of the train:

"you hear that?" - "shh" - "shut up!" -
--- the frightened riders fall into a nervous silence - in
the dark, wide-open train the riders strain to hear A DEEP
BASS NOTE - then they hear THE DISTANT SOUND OF:

AN (0.S.) ONCOMING TRAIN --- coming from somewhere deep in
the tunnel, coming closer, ON THE SAME TRACK. Wild Panic.

TUPELO LOOKS OUT THE BACK DOOR ---

--- a distant swirling glow, something is coming --- THE
ONCOMING SUBWAY SOUND GETTING LOUDER, AIR PRESSURE BUILDING---—

TUPELO
Down! Everyone down on the floor!

--- SOUND COMING CLOSER - THE SCREECH! --- but instead of
the smash/impact of a train wreck ---

THE TRAIN IS HIT BY A SEARING TORNADO OF HOT WIND ---

that BLASTS right through the stalled train as if an
invisible train is slicing through this dimension ---

 

A SWIRLING WINDSTORM OF POWER, A VORTEX OF PURE ENERGY ---

--- aglow with hot steel dust - TEARING clothing, CRACKING
glass, SLAMMING people to the floor, walls, and into each
other as it SWEEPS through each car of the train. And then ---
SILENCE ---

the sparkling steel dust becoming blackened soot. THE DOORS
ALL SLAM SHUT AGAIN --- the lights crackle back on. People
crying, bleeding, then ---

JOLT! -
40.

THE TRAIN STARTS MOVING, LIMPS FORWARD
and crawls into the Whitehall Street station.
INT. WHITEHALL STREET STATION, MANHATTAN - DAY

Doors of the battered train open, people flee for the exits,
collapse on the platform, the totally-freaked conductor barks:

CONDUCTOR
This train is now out of service!

ANGLE ON - TUPELO

in the crowd, looking for Tinkerbell. She's gone. But he sees:
IN THE TUNNEL FAR PAST THE PLATFORMS -

--- a haze of steel dust creates a shimmering negative-image
of the old subway car that passed through this space. Makes
his skin crawl. The image settles into soot and evaporates.
FROM DEEP IN THE TUNNEL ---

--- that DEEP BASS NOTE echoes - moving on.

IN A DARK SAFETY NICHE IN THE WALL OF THE TUNNEL

Tinkerbell also hears the sound. FEAR. She scribbles on a
scrap of paper the number she saw on the phantom train: 8686.

INT. SUBWAY - DIVISION OFFICE, BROOKLYN - DAY

A grimy glassed-in underground office that looks out at a
network of subway tracks. Soljak is interrogating Jimmy, the
drunk guy who was working with the killed electrician.

SOLJAK
So, you felt "a wind ---

JIMMY
And the signal lights started
flashing, and the relays ---

SOLJAK
But the current was turned off.

JIMMY
On our track, yeah, and then ---

Jimmy starts sobbing. Soljak is disgusted:
41.

SOLJAK
You got a good man killed.

Soljak grabs a phone from Terrell.
EXT. VAN CORTLAND TOWER, THE BRONX - DAY

Twenty miles away - last stop for the #3 trains. Here the

subway is elevated. A tower - an old cottage made of wood and
steel - looks over the station and streets below. Tower control-
ler MORRISEY (Jamaican, same age as Soljak) is on the phone:

MORRISEY
Mister Soljak. Hear you're call-
ing it quits. So where to now?
Florida? Gonna visit the Bronx
to say goodbye? Or are you too
busy with the mayor?

INT. SUBWAY DIVISION OFFICE, BROOKLYN - DAY
Soljak steps onto the platform to take the call.

SOLJAK
Hold the jokes. You reported a
#3 never got there?

MORRISEY
The one that left New Lots yard at
5:52, supposed to get in at 7:12 ---
(checks his thick
paperwork)
That one never showed.

SOLJAK
What do you mean it never showed?

MORRISEY
It never came in. But everything’s
screwed up here with that schmuck
you had on the tracks in Brooklyn.
(gets paperwork from an
assistant; to Soljak:)
Here: I got the #3 that left at
5:40 came in at 7. The 6 a.m. came
in at 7:15. Everything else came
and went and they should all be
back in Brooklyn by now or on
their way back here again, but
I got nothing on the 5:52 - sure
it left the yard this morning?
42.

SOLJAK
I called the yard. It left the
yard. And the bad news is the
operator and conductor are Malik
and Rodriquez, the King and Queen
of Fuck-ups. Of course they’re
not answering their phones ---
(to Terrell)
Find Malick and Rodriguez. Now.

Soljak turns to find: Michelle. She gives Soljak the "come
here" finger. Soljak gets off the phone.

MICHELLE MURPHY
We're canceling that thing tonight.

SOLJAK
My thing? No! The shuttle’s con-
nected. The Mayor’s shuttle. Food
is coming. The balloons are ready.
I'll get everything straightened
out. The shuttle’s connected and ---

MICHELLE MURPHY
And a man got ripped to pieces.

SOLJAK
That has nothing to do with us,
me. That accident was his mistake.
Workers make mistakes.

MICHELLE MURPHY
Hear what happened at Whitehall
Street? Wait ‘til the Mayor gets off
his plane and hears about that.

Soljak looks to Terrell: what’s she talking about? Terrell
has no idea.

MICHELLE MURPHY (CONT’D)
I couldn’t begin to explain it,
but it’s not good.

A Soljak look --- and Terrell’s on the phone to get details.

MICHELLE MURPHY (CONT’D)
And now I understand a train is
“missing”?

SOLJAK
“Missing”? Who said? We’re tracing
that unit. Jeez, the rumors ---
43.

MICHELLE MURPHY
Someone named Tupelo’s been calling
every city office - “my wife was on
that train and now she’s missing.”

SOLJAK
Michelle, on a slow day we get a
hundred calls about missing people.
And when we start holding trains for
investigation, like this, well ---

IN TUNNELS THROUGHOUT BROOKLYN ---
--- trains filled with passengers sit stalled in darkness.

SOLJAK (V.O.) (CONT'D)
--- every fifteen minutes we back up
nine other trains - so a stalled train
means like eight thousand people ---

ON STATION PLATFORMS THROUGHOUT BROOKLYN ---
--- crowds waiting for trains grow larger

--- are gonna be late, lost, or
whatever, times every 15 minutes
until we get our schedule back---

IN OFFICES, CLASSES, RESTAURANTS, COURTROOMS ---
--- empty chairs, missing people late for dates ---

--- which at this point could be
four or five hours ---

RANDOM FRIENDS AND BOSSES AND LOVERS are annoyed,
indifferent, or worried. Some make calls.

INT. DIVISION OFFICE PLATFORM —- DAY

SOLJAK
--- so we’re gonna get a lot of
phone calls from a lot of nuts.

MICHELLE MURPHY
This nut is Richard Tupelo, an
assistant professor of physics at
Columbia University. I checked.

SOLJAK
The guy was yelling that he was
chasing “Tinkerbell”! So what
if he's a teacher? He's a nut!
44,

Here comes Bob the Reporter. Michelle lifts her hand: stop.
She dictates the party line, wants to control this story:

MICHELLE MURPHY
A city worker - we’re checking his
blood alcohol level - got careless
and was hit by a train. That’s
worth an inch on page 17 - if you
want that exclusive interview.

BOB THE REPORTER
What about Whitehall Street?

MICHELLE MURPHY
Do you want a stalled train story
or do you want the mayor?

Bob the Reporter wants the mayor. He backs off.

MICHELLE MURPHY (CONT’D)
(to Soljak, whisper)
I still don't understand how a
train disappears.

SOLJAK
Stop using that word. All morning
we're detouring units, people throw
incorrect switches and Brooklyn
trains wind up somewhere in Queens
or the Bronx - and then the people
who screwed up turn off their phones
and try to cover their mistakes; it
happens. So let’s not create a panic
when there’s no reason for panic.

MICHELLE MURPHY
How many people on an average train?

SOLJAK
On that one we’re talking a #3 at
Bergen Street - before rush hour -
that’s a 6-car train - maybe 12-15
riders in each car - 90 people.

MICHELLE MURPHY
That’s a relief: on the day the
Mayor’s opening a new subway line
only 90 people are missing.
45.

SOLJAK
No: one person - no, one person
who says one person is missing.
Michelle, we’re in the process
of locating our motorman and
conductor. They are not our
best employees. I’m sorry.

MICHELLE MURPHY
Not good enough. You will now take
me to the place that shows where
all the trains are and I want to
talk to those people in that room.

SOLJAK
Oh: you mean the NASA room ---?

MICHELLE MURPHY
Is that what they call it?

INT. A HIGH TECH ROOM SEEN IN EXTREMELY CRISP, BRIGHT
ANTISEPTIC DETAIL ---

--- filled with rows of earnest technicians ---

SOLJAK (V.0O.)
The room with the big computer
screen like an air traffic control
place, the central command where
every one of our 6,200 cars is a
blinking light with a number that
tells you where every train is at
any given moment on our 842 miles
of interconnecting lines - so we
can simply find the train. Is that
where you want me to take you?

INT. PLATFORM OUTSIDE THE CANAL ST. INTERLOCK TOWER
Michelle Murphy nods: yes! Soljak smiles sourly:

SOLJAK
That room, Michelle, doesn't exist.
In the mind of every passenger,
every cop, every person like you
that room’s in their fantasy im-
agination. But we don't have any
room like that. We have this ---
46.

Points to the crowded, dank room beside them, in a tunnel,

with a board displaying a localized section of track and

uniform little red lights with no markings.

SOLJAK (CONT'D)
--- and a dozen more just like it.
Some even have a big map of the
whole subway system. But even
there we have no way of knowing
which trains those lights repre-
sent. We just know that each red
light is a train - but which
train? That's anyone’s guess.

MICHELLE MURPHY
(that sinking feeling)
There's no master computer?

SOLJAK

Well, we sometimes have guys posted

in the tunnels with clipboards to
mark off the trains as they pass.

City budget being what it is we're

in the 12th Century down here and
that's why we sometimes misplace

things. But we always do find them.

Besides, I don’t know that there
even is a missing train ---

Soljak thinks fast, does not want this blown out of

proportion, does not want his day ruined:

SOLJAK (CONT'D)
That guy who fell on the tracks,
that teacher - I was with him and
he saw someone who was on that
train, saw her an hour ago.

MICHELLE MURPHY
He did? Well where is he?

SOLJAK
(fishes out Tupelo's
phone number)
I got his number.

MICHELLE MURPHY
I want to see him. Get him here.

Soljak turns to find Terrell. Soljak gives him the number.
47.

SOLJAK
Find this nut. And Terrell: between
Bergen Street and Boro Hall, who's
on clipboard?

TERRELL
(ashen-faced)
We need to get to Whitehall Street.

EXT. BRONX HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

Noon. Jamal and some friends bounce out of the side exit.
Tupelo waits, adrenaline pumping.

JAMAL
It's Mister Unreal.
(pokes him)
You real today?

TUPELO
(pushes away Jamal’s
hand)
Where’s your friend Tinkerbell?

Jamal reacts, sees the bruises on Tupelo’s face.

JAMAL
What she do to you?

TUPELO
We ran into each other this morning
- and she almost killed me.

JAMAL
Not her. She's into that peace shit.

TUPELO
Didn’t seem so peaceful to me. Look,
my wife’s missing and the last
person to see her was your friend.

JAMAL
“Friend”? Who said she’s my ---

TUPELO
Tinkerbell’s in trouble. Big trouble.

Jamal motions his friends: keep going without me.

JAMAL
What? She steal some spray paint?
48.

TUPELO
The police want her for attempted
murder - attempting to murder me.
But I need to ask her some ques-—
tions before the cops get to her
- and before she disappears.

JAMAL
Like ask her what?

TUPELO
(snaps at him)

I’m talking, you’re listening. This
is your fault and you’re gonna help
me. She knocked me on the tracks.

I figured it was an accident, but
maybe she followed me ‘cause I
“touched” her - in which case I’m
blaming you, you’re involved now.

JAMAL
Me!? It was a joke. Leave me out
of this.

TUPELO

She hit me, she jumped on a train
- and now that train is missing,
and my wife - who was on that
train - is gone. But Tinkerbell's
not missing - I saw her - and

I need to ask her exactly what
happened and you are going to
help me find her.

JAMAL
But she’s not around today.

TUPELO
Where is she? Where’s she live?
Be smart. Make me your friend.

JAMAL
What do I get out of this?

Tupelo stares at Jamal: how do I reach this kid? Then:

TUPELO
I can read you. Okay? I know what
you're thinking. So here’s the
deal: if I can read your mind you
help me. If I can’t --- I give
you a hundred bucks.
49.

JAMAL
Wha -? Get away from me.

TUPELO
You scared? Why? If I lose you
get a hundred dollars.

JAMAL
Go ahead. Try. Read my mind.

Tupelo pulls out a twenty dollar bill, writes something on
it, stuffs it in Jamal’s shirt pocket.

TUPELO
Okay, look me in the eye. Pay
attention. What’s 5 + 5?

JAMAL
Shit man.

TUPELO
Answer me: what is 5 + 5?

JAMAL
Ten.

TUPELO
8 + 2, c'mon fast.

JAMAL
Ten.

TUPELO
7 + 3? Faster.

JAMAL
Ten.

TUPELO
6 + 4?

JAMAL
Ten!

TUPELO
4+ 6 ---

JAMAL

Ten.
50.

TUPELO
3 +7 ---

JAMAL
Ten.

TUPELO
2+ 8 ---

JAMAL
Ten! Ten! Ten!

TUPELO
Name a vegetable.

JAMAL
Uh, uh --- carrot.

TUPELO

Take that twenty out and see
what I wrote on it.

Jamal pulls out the bill, unfolds it. It says: CARROT

JAMAL
Shit! How the hell did you---!!?

"7

Tupelo grabs Jamal by the sleeve and starts walking him.

TUPELO
I’1l tell you after we find her.
Keep the twenty. Let’s go.

INT. WHITEHALL STREET STATION, MANHATTAN - DAY

Controlled chaos. Soljak and cops huddle around the operator
of the train hit by the storm of energy. People get first aid,
inspectors take statements. TRANSIT OFFICIALS compare notes:

TRANSIT OFFICIAL
Sixty-five people taken to the
hospital, sixty treated here and
released, and I guess we’re look-
ing at about five hundred lawsuits.

TRANSIT LAWYER
Subway doors open in a tunnel ---
this leads the evening news. When
the mayor lands - we’re screwed.

ELECTRICAL ENGINEERS climb from the track pit.
51.

ELECTRICAL ENGINEER
(to Soljak)
Every relay’s fried all the way
back to Court Street. And get this:
there’s a section of rail turned
black. What the hell’s that mean?

SOLJAK
I need to take a look at that.

TERRELL
(tugs at Soljak)
They finally sent the tapes over.

SOLJAK
What tapes?

TERRELL
Bergen Street.

SOLJAK

(to the engineer)
Gimme a minute.

INT. WHITEHALL INTERLOCK CONTROL ROOM - DAY

A surprisingly primitive room at the end of an underground
platform - tiny lights on a map show a local section of
track. Soljak, cops, and TA Officials watch a portable
monitor connected to an out-of-date digital video player.
ON THE MONITOR (6:20 a.m.)

A TRAIN PULLS INTO A STATION - WE SEE: Tupelo and Renee rush
onto the platform, get on the last car of the train.

SOLJAK
Okay, that's Grand Army Plaza.

TA OFFICIAL
Why the hell’s that old car hooked on
it? I thought we junked all of those.

Soljak says nothing as ON THE MONITOR: The train with Car
#8686 at the rear pulls out of the station.

TA TECHNICIAN
Now the next station, Bergen Street.

THE IMAGE SWITCHES TO THE BERGEN STREET STATION (6:23 a.m.) -

Train pulls into station. Tupelo steps out. Tupelo reacts to
52.

Renee - starts to get back on. Doors close. He pounds the
door. Train moves on. Tupelo left behind. Renee goes to
the back window. BANG! ---

--- Tupelo is hit, falls into the track pit as Tinkerbell
chases the train and leaps on to the last car and the train
disappears into the tunnel. Cops pull Tupelo from the tracks.
SOLJAK
(to the technician)
Go to Atlantic Avenue - next stop.
The technician hesitates, looks to the TA officials. Then:

TECHNICIAN
We don't have cameras there.

SOLJAK
What!?

OFFICER GARRETT
Only half the stations have cameras.

SOLJAK
No cameras at Atlantic Avenue?

TRANSIT OFFICIAL

Not yet.
SOLJAK

Atlantic Avenue with nine connect-

ing lines --- and no cameras? Is

this possible!? You're getting rid
of half my ticket clerks who
watch everything before you have
cameras in all the stations!?

TERRELL
(wants to calm the boss)
What's the next station with a camera?

TECHNICIAN
DeKalb Avenue.

SOLJAK
Go to DeKalb - at what time Terrell?

TERRELL
Train left Bergen Street at 6:23,
should pull into DeKalb at 6:38.
53.

MONITOR VIEW: DEKALB STATION - the time code reads 6:36.
People begin to crowd onto the platform. At 6:38 - no
train. RAPT ATTENTION IN THE CONTROL ROOM as they see
the platform get more crowded. On the monitor: 6:39.

THE TECHNICIAN FAST FORWARDS - 6:40. 6:43. 6:49---

TECHNICIAN
Nothing arrives until 6:52 - and
it's a different train.

SOLJAK
(controlled fury)
Great. Terrific. Fine. So a train
leaves Bergen Street and - what? -
evaporates? Gets on a boat and goes
to the Bahamas? Shut down the whole
tunnel from Bergen Street to DeKalb.

TRANSIT OFFICIAL
There goes our rush hour.

SOLJAK
Let ‘em walk. Maybe they'll appre-
ciate what we do down here. I’m
gonna walk. Yeah. I’m gonna walk
that tunnel, personally, and I'm
gonna find out what the ---

Suddenly: the voice of ---

MICHELLE MURPHY
Mr. Soljak, may I speak to you
alone for a moment?

This is not good. They step out of the crowded control room.

SOLJAK
Go ahead. Cancel the party. Early
retirement. As of tonight I quit.

MICHELLE MURPHY

I tried to cancel it, now I can’t.

(off Soljak’s reaction)
The mayor called from his plane -
looking down at America he calls
me, and insists on this party ---
to show strength and confidence,
‘cause he’s heard your entire
goddamn subway’s falling apart!

SOLJAK
It’s always falling apart
54.

MICHELLE MURPHY
Well fix it before he gets here!
(then a strange smirk)
Uh, find that man you were looking
for? Columbia University? Professor?
The science guy?

SOLJAK
Not my priority right now.

MICHELLE MURPHY
Make it your priority. Cops were
just at his apartment ---

INT. BROOKLYN APARTMENT - DAY

Officer Garrett and a DETECTIVE look around the place, see
the mirrors, the model car. As they move around the model
reflected in the mirrors - the car disappears.

MICHELLE MURPHY (V.O.)
Seems he’s also some kind of
magician. And he does have a wife
who seems to have vanished. Cops
are looking for him now. And
something else about him ---

The detective breaks through the locked bedroom door. Flicks
on the light. We don’t see what he sees, but his expression
is raw.
INT. SUBWAY DISPATCH PLATFORM - DAY
Michelle presses Soljak:
MICHELLE MURPHY (CONT’D)

We might have a psycho on our hands.

You said you had his phone number.

Where is he?
INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - DAY

Three sets of parallel tracks through a dark dripping tunnel.
WE HEAR that DEEP BASS NOTE - makes our skin crawl.

Switches and light signals in the center track begin to shift
and strobe. The missing train is here - invisible - pulling
energy from the system.

WE SEE the GLOW, HEAR the GROWL of a very real oncoming train
rounding a curve on the side tracks.

NOW WE ARE ---—
55.

INSIDE THE MOTORMAN’S COMPARTMENT - MOTORMAN’S POV

Easing the throttle to control the speed as he takes the
curve - the lives of five hundred passengers in his hand -
the ribbon of glowing track heading towards a station. He
HEARS - above the rattle and noise in his compartment -
that DEEP BASS NOTE from somewhere.

INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - DAY

The “phantom” train’s tracks begin to SHUDDER - rails GLOWING
with a surge of energy - the GLOW JUMPING onto the tracks of
the passing real train - transferring energy - and control.
INT. SUBWAY - MOTORMAN’S POV - SPEEDING THROUGH A TUNNEL,

It’s as if WE’RE DRIVING THE TRAIN as it enters the station.
The platform overcrowded. The motorman plays the brakes - needs
110 yards to stop - people push close to the edge - from the
motorman’s POV we see the inherent danger. SUDDENLY ---

A LITTLE GIRL DARTS OUT TOWARDS THE EDGE.

Motorman presses the brake hard. IT’S LOCKED - won’t move ---
Motorman BLASTS his horn.

SOMEONE GRABS THE KID before the train slams her. Brakes now
engage - the motorman slams the throttle - WHEELS SCREECHING -
stopping the train two cars past the end of the platform.

WE SEE THE MOTORMAN’S FACE:

He’s freaked. We’re freaked. Now we’re all on edge as ---

THAT STORM OF POWER

flashes past the train and continues deeper into the tunnel.

INT. ATLANTIC AVENUE SUBWAY PLATFORMS, BROOKLYN - DAY

In the grip of chaos, crowded - confused people try to hear
an announcement that hints at the density of action here:

STATION ANNOUNCEMENT
All D Trains have been taken out of
service, transfer to the Q. The 2, 3,
4 and 5 on the lower levels and the M
and N will be using the B and R plat-
forms and all F, A, and C Trains in
both directions have been diverted
to the central platform tracks.
56.

CLOSE SHOT - A FINGER ---—

--- on the large subway wall map traces the route of the #3 -
the red line - as it moves down from the Bronx and Manhattan
into Brooklyn until it reaches ---

ON THE MAP —- BROOKLYN: THE BORO HALL-ATLANTIC-DEKALB VORTEX

An overlay of 9 stations where every subway line converges:
orange, red, green, blue, yellow, brown - the entire spectrum
as if laid out by a shattered prism through which every train
in the system eventually passes. The finger belongs to ---

JAMAL
We're here. “The Power Spot” she
calls it. C’mon, let’s go --- I

want to know about that carrot.
INT. THE BORO HALL-ATLANTIC-DEKALB VORTEX - DAY

As Jamal leads Tupelo through the multi-level labyrinth of
staircases, tunnels, and passageways, the ballet of people
moving up-down-across-—and-around seems like an M.C. ESCHER
DRAWING of interlocked motion and connection. ON THE MOVE:

JAMAL
So how'd you do it?

TUPELO
It was easy.

JAMAL

If it’s so easy why can’t you
read my mind and know where
she is right now?

TUPELO
Don’t get cute. That wasn’t the
bet, that wasn’t our deal.

JAMAL
But how’d you do it? Tell me.

TUPELO
The minute we find her.

They move past a row of subway shops - shoe repair, keys,

pizza - a radio blares “Our Lips Are Sealed” - drowned out
by a SUBWAY SCREECH! - and a dark BASS NOTE from some deep
subterranean place. Tupelo winces. Jamal keeps them moving.

JAMAL
So how’d you know she was the one?
Tupelo grabs

57.

TUPELO
Tinkerbell?

JAMAL
No man, your wife. How’d you know
she was the one for you?

TUPELO
I just felt it. I just knew.

JAMAL
“Just knew” - you got to do better
than that, man. Was it what? - her
looks? Way she kissed you? Gimme
some direction here. Shit, you’d
make some lousy father.

Jamal, slams him into the wall. Jamal reacts -

innocent - it was a joke. Tupelo’s face: twisted.

Tupelo eases

Tupelo nods,

JAMAL (CONT'D)
Chill man. Be the grown-up. What?

off. Then calmly gives the answer:

TUPELO

It was the way she looked, and the
way she looked at me, and the way
she would say things, and what
things bothered her, and what
things didn’t bother her, and ---
she was great to kiss and we were
just - we were a great team.

JAMAL
“Were,” “was,” “used to,” what's
all the past tense? You over it?

TUPELO
We’ve got some problems now. But
you don’t quit on someone cause
you have problems. You try to fix
things, try to get things right
again. You try to get things back.

JAMAL
Hope it works out. For real.

smiles at this kid, then something catches his

eye on the wall just beyond Jamal’s shoulder ---
58.

THE NYC SUBWAY WALL MAP - CLOSE SHOT —- DOWNTOWN BROOKLYN

--- where all the subway lines converge into what LOOKS
LIKE A HOPELESSLY KNOTTED WEB OF MULTI-COLORED STRINGS.

TUPELO SEES

some pattern in the map, some pattern in those strings
converging in Brooklyn, some pattern he’s trying to read,
formulate, comprehend. He mutters:

TUPELO
Never saw it like this. This looks
--- it’s just like a

 

 

He digs into his pocket, finds the card Soljak gave him, moves
to find a weak cell phone signal. Bangs out Soljak’s number.

EXT. DOWNTOWN BROOKLYN - DAY
Soljak on the street, moving, takes the staticky call.

SOLJAK
Who's this?

INT. ATLANTIC STREET STATION - DAY
Tupelo covers his ear, cups the cell phone:
TUPELO
The guy who got pushed on the
tracks. Find that train yet?

INTERCUT STREET AND SUBWAY -—

--- both noisy as hell ---

SOLJAK
No. You got it?

TUPELO
What kind of stupid question
is that? You think I ---? So

you can’t find it, huh? Well,
I’m looking at a map here ---

SOLJAK
Where are you Mr. Tupelo?

TUPELO
Do you know what a Moebius Strip
is? Tell me about this morning.
59.

SOLJAK
First you tell me: where are you?

INT. ATLANTIC STREET STATION —- DAY

Tupelo senses trouble. Ends the call. Stares at the map of
knotted lines in Brooklyn. Jamal grabs his arm.

JAMAL
This ain't the art museum. You want
Tinkerbell? Come on!

INT. BERGEN STREET STATION - DAY

Soljak pushes his way downstairs to the station and tunnel where
the train disappeared. As transit workers put up barriers---

STATION ANNOUNCEMENT
This station has been closed. We
apologize for the inconvenience.

--- a throng of angry commuters exits upstairs - some people
bark, others make it easy - intertwined human behavior - but
Soljak is not part of this people-world and we realize, even
in the crowd, how deeply alone he is. A transit worker wear-
ing safety gear, with clipboard (CLIPBOARD MAN), meets him.

CLIPBOARD MAN
Ever wonder where they’re all going?

SOLJAK
No. I’m just supposed to get them
there. Let’s do this.

INT. IN THE BERGEN-ATLANTIC AVENUE TUNNEL

Soljak and Clipboard Man - reflective vests, flashlights -
walk the dark one-track tunnel. If a train comes, no escape.
But this track is shut. We hope. A half-mile of signal lights
warn: STOP. A dark world of strange noises, trash, and rats.

SOLJAK
A train entered this tunnel. No
evidence it came out. Magic, huh?

Clipboard Man tests a smile - sees that Soljak is not joking.

CLIPBOARD MAN
There are no switches until the next
stop, sir. Train goes in here, only
thing that could happen is ---
60.

SOLJAK
Yeah?

Beat.

CLIPBOARD MAN
I don’t know.

Each step deeper into the tunnel echoes louder. Now between
the tracks: burnt rats. Clipboard Man looks back towards the
lights of Bergen Street Station - a quarter mile away. It’s a
quarter mile further to Atlantic Avenue Station. They’re in
the middle. Clipboard Man is already jittery, then:

SOLJAK
Stop.

CLIPBOARD MAN
(wants to run away)
You hear something?

SOLJAK
Give me your light.

Soljak shines both lights on the rails. A section of rail is
a dense jet black.

CLIPBOARD MAN
Never seen that before. You?

Soljak has - but doesn’t answer.

He moves closer to the blackened rail. Careful. Bends to
touch it, wipes the soot - the steel itself has turned black.

CLIPBOARD MAN (CONT’D)
What’s it mean?

Soljak finger to lips: shh. A throb in the tunnel. Tension.
CLIPBOARD MAN (CONT’D)
(voice shaky)
Uh, sir --- Chief --- over there---

Soljak aims the lights further down the track.

SOLJAK
Don’t move.

Soljak steps forward. Stops. Sees:
61.

TINKERBELL’S BACKPACK

in the muck between the tracks. Covered with scribbled notes.
Looks like a bomb.

CLIPBOARD MAN
(backing away)
Don’t touch it. Could be ---.

Soljak knows it means something, but not a bomb. Still:

SOLJAK
Slap yourself and calm down. We
have to follow protocol - call
the cops and the FBI. You’re
in charge here now.

CLIPBOARD MAN
Me? What are you gonna do?

SOLJAK
Cancel a party.

INT. DOWNTOWN BROOKLYN SUBWAY STATION - DAY

Lowest level. Jamal and Tupelo. Alone. Signs: IF YOU SEE
SOMETHING SAY SOMETHING. There are rusted doors on the
platform wall, so rusted you'd pass them without noticing.
But one is freshly spray-painted yellow.

JAMAL
That's her.

Jamal goes to the yellow-sprayed lock. Has a key.

TUPELO
Where'd you get that?

JAMAL
I look out for her sometimes.

The lock CLICKS. Jamal pulls the creaky door open. It's a
dark, drippy, rust-streaked entrance to a chilly underworld
that leads down to a humming realm beneath the subway.

JAMAL (CONT'D)
She says this leads to hell. Still
want to find your wife?
EXT. DOWNTOWN BROOKLYN - DAY

Bomb squad vans SCREAM and PUSH through the traffic. Cops and
transit workers evacuate the stations. News and police heli-

copters overhead. Chaos verging on panic. And now it’s
staring to RAIN. CAMERA FINDS: Soljak - alone in the crowd
- keeping something to himself.

TV NEWSWOMAN
The discovery of a suspicious device
on the tracks has shut down all
subway lines in Brooklyn. Police
cannot say when the stations will
be re-opened, but investigators-—--

Nothing Soljak can do here - gets in a waiting car driven by
Terrell. Terrell puts a red light on top and kicks the siren.

INT. PHYSICS LAB —- COLUMBIA UNIVERSTIY, MANHATTAN - DAY

OUTSIDE THE WINDOW: SIRENS SCREAM through traffic. INSIDE:
Soljak and Terrell with department head PROFESSOR WILKIE.
Formulas cover the walls. Soljak is shocked as he repeats
what Wilkie just said:

SOLJAK
You mean we've been trying to find
this guy and now you tell me he’s
not some kind of professor here?

WILKIE
Not anymore. We lost “Artie.” Bril-
liant student, but ---

SOLJAK
Artie? I’m looking for Richard
Tupelo. Who’s “Artie’?

WILKIE
That’s what we called him: “R-T” -
Richard Tupelo - his initials.

SOLJAK
(to Terrell)
Who said he was a teacher here?

TERRELL
Michelle Murphy.

Soljak motions Terrell: we’re in the wrong place.
WILKIE
He once taught here. I understand
he still is a teacher - a substi-
tute teacher, in The Bronx ---

Substitute teacher? It’s migraine time for Soljak.
63.

SOLJAK
Look, we’ve got a train missing,
he may be involved, and we need to
find him. Where do we look?

WILKIE
Artie’s had a tough run, but I
can’t imagine ---

SOLJAK
“Tough run” - what’s that mean?

WILKIE
He lost a baby - staph infection -
no one’s fault, she went so quick,
it just happened ---

INT. TUPELO AND RENEE’S APARTMENT - EARLIER TODAY

The cops push into the locked bedroom --- baby clothes,
a bassinet, changing table, toys and dolls - all tossed
into an angry, ugly pile in the middle of the floor

WILKIE (V.O.)
--- and I hear his marriage ---.

INT. THE LAB - DAY

WILKIE
And he was one of my brightest.
Sadly what he chose to work on
was a mistake.

SOLJAK
I’m almost afraid to ask.

Wilkie explains by drawing a single line across a chalkboard.

WILKIE
This is the electromagnetic spectrum:
this area - radio waves, radar, infra-
red, X-rays, gamma rays - nothing we
can see --- only this very small part
of the wave band, here, in the middle,
just this fraction of the spectrum is
what we can see with our eyes - but
all the rest, even if we can’t see it
- it all exists. But we only see this
tiny piece of our world.

SOLJAK
Yeah I get it. I work with engineers.
I’m not an idiot. So what?
64.

WILKIE
The invisible spectrum. Very
exciting field. Only he took
things too far.

Soljak: which means? Wilkie makes a dot far to the right:

WILKIE (CONT'D)
Out here are electromagnetic waves
with stupendously high frequencies.
He felt, and taught, that out here
the speed of light is not absolute,
that pulses of energy could travel
faster than light. I warned him it
was laughable, but he persisted.
I had to ask him to leave.

The (O.S.) RUMBLE of the subway that runs beneath the
university. That sound shakes us up. Now it also shakes
up Soljak. He pulls Terrell to the exit ---

SOLJAK
Thanks for the class.
WILKIE
Of course now it seems he was right.
SOLJAK
About what?
WILKIE

We’re only just developing the tools
to prove it but now we know that a
pulse of light shot into a strand of
optical fiber can depart before it
even enters, indeed faster than the
speed of light - it’s now part of
our science. I’ve always wanted to
apologize to “R-T” ---

Soljak squints, Wilkie presses on:

WILKIE (CONT'D)
--- you see, he knew it: if anything
is faster than light, imagine the
possibilities of perception, dimen-
sions, and what might be happening,
right now, all around us and right
beneath our feet.

INT. DARK STAIRWAY DEEP IN THE SUBWAY

Dripping with stalagmites and laced with a spiderweb of siz-
65.

zling, hissing wires covered with smoking wet rags, walls
crawling with bugs, sounds of scurrying rats as Tupelo and
Jamal make their way down the rotted staircase, emerging in---

INT. THE OLD MYRTLE STREET STATION —- BROOKLYN

A dark, haunted place with it’s signs fallen down, potholes
on the platform, and cracked tiles on the walls - one of
the dozen gloomy, abandoned New York subway stations.

TUPELO
Myrtle Street. Damn - this was a
stop when I was a kid.

Rain drizzles down from the track ceiling. Lights flicker.

The effect is a TWINKLING STROBE-EFFECT that plays with our
sense of depth, space, and reality. As Tupelo’s eyes focus

they come to rest on an old rusted plaque on the wall:

THE SUP RVISOR FOR THIS STATION IS CRYTHEN BELL

TUPELO (CONT’D)
(remembers ---)
“Cry Then Bell” --- that was one
of her notes. She lives here?

JAMAL
Hides out from the world.

TUPELO
But then she goes to school?

JAMAL
Hot meals for free. Guess she likes
other kids. But this is her place.

TUPELO
Where?

JAMAL
Right there ---

Tupelo’s breath catches. Twenty steps away a pile of rags and
cardboard on a broken subway bench camouflages a fragile
human: Tinkerbell. Jamal repeats what Tupelo sneered at him:

JAMAL (CONT'D)
Thing you need to learn is: “as
tough as you think your life is,
for someone else it's even worse.”
66.

TUPELO
(chastened)
She have any family?

JAMAL
Oh, she has people ---
(shakes his head, disgust)
That’s why she’s down here.
TINKERBELL WHISPERS

-- her fury and bravado gone - a frightened kid:

TINKERBELL
Help me.
Tupelo kneels beside her.
TUPELO
I want to. But first I need you

to help me.

She tries to make herself smaller. Covering the grimy wall
behind her she’s created a collage of old and new found
expressions: WHO WILL BE MISS SUBWAYS? - IF YOU SEE SOME-
THING SAY SOMETHING - HANDS OFF UNLESS AUTHORIZED - and:
“8686” - stuck to the wall with tape and gum.

TUPELO (CONT’D)
“WHO WILL BE MISS SUBWAYS”? ---
that’s from like fifty years ago,
where did you see that?

TINKERBELL
Sometimes my head feels sick and
I see things. But this morning,
it was the worst --- like what you
said: close off a room and inside,
no one’s looking, it’s all crazy,
right? Well sometimes, what you
said no one can see - well, some-
times, I can.

TUPELO
(this is huge for him)
You can? Really? What’s it like?

She looks to Jamal - can I trust him? Jamal nods.

TINKERBELL
Everything moving real fast, but
soft, like clouds of color, like
(MORE )
67.

TINKERBELL (CONT'D)
the whole world is melting - then
it goes away. When I tell people
about it they all wanna lock me
up, they think I’m crazy. Am I?

Tupelo tests touching her shoulder. She doesn’t pull away,
but her hands are clutched tightly inside her coat. Gently:

TUPELO
What you see - don’t be scared of
it. It’s a gift, a wonderful power
that I think we’re all born with
and then we forget: the world as
it is - an accurate vision of light
and form and color. It’s what babies
see when they first open their eyes
- before they’re trained to just
see the world as this ---

He motions to the world around them: filth, grease, darkness.

TUPELO (CONT'D)
What did you see this morning?

Her voice is even, soft, but her eyes are pure terror:
TINKERBELL
I was running, they were chasing me,
so I jumped ---
BAM!!!!}! ---
WE ARE BACK IN THE BERGEN STREET STATION AT 6:23 A.M.
TINKERBELL HAS JUST LEAPT OFF THE PLATFORM ---
--- AND CAUGHT ONTO THE BACK OF THE MOVING TRAIN
As Tinkerbell grips the greasy, swinging, clattering guard
chains and pulls herself up onto the swaying foot plate -
grime and dust swirling ---
TINKERBELL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
I saw this lady’s face, she looked
like she hated me ---
Renee is pressed to the window, terror, fury ---
TUPELO (V.O.)
That was my wife, she’d just seen

you push me onto the tracks.

Renee starts banging on the window of the locked rear door -
all the anger and sadness and disappointments and pain of
68.

her life now focused on Tinkerbell ---

TINKERBELL (V.O.)
--- but then she looked at me ---

Renee - her eyes locked on Tinkerbell - sees a frightened
teenager - and Renee’s face takes on an almost-angelic glow.

--- like she cared about me ---

Renee’s fists open, her palms to the window, trying to comfort
this frightened child. A POWERFUL MOMENT: Renee as strength,
hope, promise, and pure love - the Renee that Tupelo loves ---

TINKERBELL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
--- but behind her ---

WE SEE: THE ONCOMING STORM. Renee is framed in its halo, and
just as it reaches her ---

CUT TO:
INT. THE OLD MYRTLE STREET STATION ---

Tinkerbell falls silent. Does not want to remember. Tupelo
touches her cheek. She continues:

TINKERBELL

I don’t know the words - it was
coming right at me and then the
train was gone and the lady was
gone and just before it got to
me I just let go and I fell on
the tracks and ---

(crying like a little kid)
I hurt myself.

Tupelo puts his arms around her as if she were his own child.
He moves the rags from her clasped hands. Her palms and wrists
are a HORRIBLE STEW OF BRUISES, CUTS, FILTH, WET AND DRY BLOOD
from when she fell.

JAMAL
Aw --- Tink ---.

Tupelo hugs her closer - father of the year.

TUPELO
We need to get you cleaned and fixed.

TINKERBELL
No. No doctors.
Jamal starts

She motions:
platform, ON

69.

TUPELO
You will lose your hands.

JAMAL
(first time: fear)
You got to let him help. He’s okay.

TINKERBELL
But it’s all gone. I thought it
was just those things I see but
then people were looking for it
and they said the train was gone
so it really did happen, right?

TUPELO
Yes. It did. The train disappeared.

to joke, sees Tupelo is serious.

TINKERBELL
I think I know why it happened.

JAMAL
We got to get her to a doctor.

TUPELO
That’1l be your job. I’11 tell you
who to take her to. After.
(to Tinkerbell)
What made it happen?

TINKERBELL
That lady who didn’t hate me ---
promise me you’1ll save her.

TUPELO
That’s why I’m here.

follow me. She leads them towards the end of the
THE OLD SUBWAY BENCH we see a mark of vandalism

on the wood - faded carved initials: “RT”.

AT THE END OF THE PLATFORM:

TinkerBell pulls open a sheet of corrugated tin that leads to ---

THE “BENCH-WALL” —

- a narrow ledge right above the tracks that hugs the walls of
tunnels and lead to secret rooms and stairways to even deeper
depths. As they follow TinkerBell along the slippery ledge it
seems they’re alone in the center of the earth. Then they hear:
70.

A STRANGE CHORUS OF CHIRPING -

Tupelo: Huh? He peers into a tiny portal, sees a hidden room
that sounds like IT’S FILLED WITH DERANGED CRICKETS. This is ---

A RELAY ROOM --—

--- a tarp-covered, rag-filled, spiderweb of wires that hide
a crucial part of the subway’s nervous system, yet also one
of the most ancient - “relays” are small switches flicking on
and off, a technology in use since the subway opened in 1904.
Tinkerbell tries to explain:

TINKERBELL
Whenever trains go by they always
start clicking back and forth ---

TUPLEO
Some kind of electromagnets.
(sees the cloth-covered wires
leading out of the room)
Must be connected to the tracks some-
where, and when a train passes ---
(figures)
It shorts the circuit. Which would
let the system know a train is
there --- or not.
(astonished: )
Those aren’t even plastic, they’re
Bakelite, from the 30’s, and all
those wires - all wrapped in
cloth! Jeez, pure entropy.

JAMAL
What’s that mean?

Tupelo wants to keep moving, no time to explain. Jamal holds
him, always wants answers. So:

INT. SUBWAY CAR - FLASHBACK - DAY

TUPELO AND RENEE - pressed together in a crowded, moving,
subway car - they hold each other, the moment they were
most in love ---

TUPELO (V.O.)
It means that anything complex and
interconnected ---

CAMERA EDGES BACK: RENEE IS PREGNANT - this is a happier time
for them, a time of hope and promise, THEY SEEM TO GLOW ---
71.

TUPELO (V.O.) (CONT’D)
--- unless you keep it right ---

FLASHBACK: TUPELO AND RENEE KISS.

TUPELO (CONT’D)
Will always break down.

INSTANT PULLBACK FROM INSIDE THE TRAIN AND ---
WE ARE IN A SUBWAY TUNNEL (FLASHBACK CONTINUES) AS ---

THE TRAIN SWEEPS PAST OUR VIEW: RENEE AND TUPELO, GLOWING IN
EACH OTHER'S LOVE, become a smear of steel, flesh, and light.

TUPELO (V.O.)
And when it does start breaking down ---

CLOSE SHOT - THE TRAIN’S UNDERBELLY AND THE TRACKS

BLUE SPARKS as the speeding train’s “shoes” scrape the third
rail - picking up the current that powers the train.

TUPELO (V.O.) (CONT’D)
--- you might never know how the
problems got started.

INSTANTLY WE ARE TRANSPORTED --——

--- into a small, hyper-clean UNREAL white room with one
simple relay switch atop a metal table.

TUPELO (V.O.) (CONT’D)
Like: if this room were empty, any-
thing changes - like a piece of
paper near a wire - you'd see it.

A crumbled piece of paper NOW APPEARS --- too close to an
exposed wire - ready to spark. Easy to see. Easy to fix.

TUPELO (V.O.) (CONT’D)
But if that same room is ---

THAT HYPER-CLEAN ROOM AGAIN BECOMES THE REALITY: THE SMALL
FILTHY RELAY ROOM ---

TUPELO (V.O.) (CONT’D)
--- a maze of distractions crowded
with rags and wires - with water
dripping and sparks flying - you'd
never see the trouble ---

--- that shred of paper about to catch fire can no longer

even be seen.
EXT. HELICOPTER POV - NEW YORK CITY

Thousands of streets and buildings, bridges and highways
moving ten million people - an organism of complex and
infinite connections, now falling into chaos and crisis ---

TUPELO (V.O.) (CONT’D)
--- and when all those little troubles
and problems cause the whole system to
fail - no one would ever know why.

THE HELICOPTER - “CITY OF NEW YORK” LOGO ---

- lands. Michelle anxiously waits on the helipad tarmac to
greet --- THE MAYOR. WE RETURN TO:

INT. THE DEPTHS OF THE SUBWAY SYSTEM —

Tupelo, Tinkerbell, and Jamal stand on the slippery benchwall
above the tracks, peer into the mess that is Relay Room 243.

TUPELO
How many rooms like this?

TINKERBELL
Whole city. In all the tunnels.
Everywhere. C’mere, gets worse ---

She motions to the slimiest, rustiest, most corroded metal
door seen yet - no doubt the passage to some even more horrid,
dungeon-like mystery. Tupelo takes a deep breath, then nods:
open it. She pushes open the filthy portal ---

ANGLE ON - TUPELO -
--- what he sees takes his breath away. HE SEES:
INT. THE NEW MYRTLE STREET SHUTTLE STATION
A pure white, antiseptically clean, shining SUBWAY STATION -
SOMETHING WE NEVER EVEN IMAGINED COULD EXIST --- like a space
station with electronic signs and shiny sets of track, even
the tunnels leading in and out of this station are spotless.
It’s like some imaginary wonder-world, but this place is real.
TINKERBELL
(gives her the creeps)
They just made it. For the O Line.

FROM SOMEWHERE FAR ABOVE they can hear/feel the rumblings of
73.

trains, water mains, power lines, and a city of ten million
people - but down here it’s like a beautiful, lifeless tomb.

TINKERBELL (CONT’D)
Like a year ago they started fixing
this place up --- and that’s when
the crazy things started to happen.

Tupelo goes to a backlit 8ft-high subway map set in the wall.

TUPELO
Where are we now?

TINKERBELL
Right here ---

She points to that “Power Spot” confluence of connections in
Brooklyn, but now there’s a new marking on this map:

THE “O LINE SHUTTLE,”

a silver line that sweeps through Brooklyn’s knot of multi-
colored transit lines and continues through to Queens, The
Bronx, Manhattan, and back to Brooklyn --- tying all the
strands of the system together.

ANGLE ON - TUPELO

He is mystified, incredulous, half elated, half horrified:

TUPELO
This is so sick.

JAMAL AND TINKERBELL
What!?

Tupelo points to the subway map on the wall:

TUPELO
You see this new line? You see what
happens here? They have no idea, but
--- I was right - it’s real ---
they've created a Moebius Strip!

B-RING! - B-RING! ----
They STARTLE --- huh? - it’s Tupelo’s cell phone.
TUPELO (CONT’D)

This works ---? We’re five levels
down into bedrock. How’s this ---?
74.

JAMAL
Look: cell phone boosters built
right into the walls. Cool.

Tupelo looks at his ringing phone:

TUPELO
27 missed calls and messages ---
(he answers the
incoming call)
Hello --- ?

Tupelo has to move the phone from his ear ---

SOLJAK
(ON THE PHONE, BELLOWING)
Where the hell you been!?

TUPELO
Ah, my new friend.

SOLJAK (ON THE PHONE)
So Tupelo, this some kind of prank?

TUPELO
Screw you, my wife’s on that train.

SOLJAK
Tell me this is a joke. Some magic
shit - smoke and mirrors.

TUPELO
Goodbye.

SOLJAK (ON THE PHONE)
Don’t hang up! ---

EXT. ON THE STREET —- DAY

GRIDLOCK, SIRENS, CROWDS, COPS, BOMB SQUAD, NEWS, FBI, HELI-
COPTERS OVERHEAD, - Soljak - pacing, on the phone - is
watching the world as he and we know it falls apart.

SOLJAK
Are you playing games with me?

TUPELO (ON PHONE)
What happened at 6:23 this morning
that never happened before?
75.

SOLJAK
6:23 ---? Where are you?

TUPELO (ON PHONE)
In the Myrtle Street Station.

SOLJAK
The old station?!

TUPELO (ON PHONE)
No. The new station.

SOLJAK
The shuttle? You can’t be in that
station. It’s all locked up.

TUPELO (ON PHONE)
And yet, here I am. What happened
today at 6:23 a.m?

SOLJAK
What do you care? What’s that got
to do with ---

TUPELO

Hey Pal, you wouldn’t be calling

me unless you couldn’t call anyone
else. You know something’s wrong.
What happened this morning at 6:23?!

SOLJAK
The shuttle happened. We finally
connected the last tracks of the
shuttle.

INT. THE NEW STATION - DAY
Tupelo, speaking to Soljak, traces the shuttle line on the map.

TUPELO
And at that moment every subway
line in the city was turned into
one giant endless loop?

SOLJAK (PHONE)
Yeah. 6:23. First time ever.
What’s that got to do with the
Number 3 going AWOL?

TUPELO
Maybe everything. Soljak, is that
train really missing?
76.

EXT. ON THE STREET - DAY
Tightly-wound Soljak responds quietly:

SOLJAK
We’ve combed every inch of track
in the city ---
(hates to admit:)
Yes. It’s gone.

INT THE NEW STATION - DAY

Tupelo’s eyes focus on the ominously-glowing subway map, and
the Power Spot in Brooklyn where all the lines converge.

TUPELO
Then every train is in danger now.
And the one that’s missing --- if

you want it back then get down
here. Alone. No cops. Got that?
Get down here. And I'll find it.

Tupelo disconnects. To Jamal:

TUPELO (CONT’D)
Take her to Brooklyn Hospital. Go
up to the fifth floor, find Nurse
Judy, and tell them Tinkerbell is
Renee’s niece.

JAMAL
Who’s Renee?

TUPELO
My wife. She’s a nurse there and
they’1l do anything for her.
(to Tinkerbell)
She was the lady on the train.

TINKERBELL
Do I have to be her niece? Can I
be her kid? Can she be my mother?

TUPELO
She’s not ready for that.

JAMAL
What are you gonna do?

TUPELO
Force that train back to where
it escaped from, even if I have
to shut down the whole city.
77.

JAMAL
They won’t let you do that.

TUPELO
They'll have to. Now get her to
the doctor, get out of here!

Jamal pulls Tupelo aside, concerned, whispers:

JAMAL
If the cops grab Tink’ --- gimme
your phone number.

Tupelo scribbles the number --- pushes Jamal to go. Jamal and
Tinkerbell head towards the secret exit. Tupelo glances once
more at the map and its jumble of knotted lines in Brooklyn.

TUPELO
Wait! Tinker--- “Teena” - right? --
- all those little papers you cut
up and write on --- you got a
piece of paper for me?

She nods, finds in her pocket a sheet of paper.

TUPELO (CONT’D)
And a scissors.

TINKERBELL
Scissors? No - I got this ---

A razor.

TUPELO
Fine. And some tape. And a pen!

JAMAL
You gonna get your train back with
a razor blade, paper and a pen?
Tinerbell has tape and a marker. Tupelo kisses her forehead.
TUPELO
Good kid. Both of you. Now get to
the hospital. Move!

Jamal won't move:

JAMAL
How'd you know I'd say “carrot”?
78.

TUPELO
It was just a trick. Dumb trick.
Get going.

JAMAL

But how’d you do it? You said
you'd tell me.

TUPELO

(exasperated, but has

to tell him: )
Ask anyone a series of fast simple
questions - 2+8, 3+7, 5+5, 6+4 -
that stops their thinking - then
ask them to name a vegetable. Most
people will say “carrot.” It’s a
fact. Now get out of here. Go!

EXT. CITY STREETS

A TV NEWS REPORTER giving her LIVE REPORT stands in front of
crowds, cops, and Bomb Squad vans.

NEW REPORTER
A child’s backpack on the tracks was
all it took to shut down the subway
at rush hour. But in today’s world
most would agree it’s better to be
safe than sorry. The good news: all
subway lines are again in operation.
Still, with the system just getting
back underway, expect delays that
will inconvenience millions of New
Yorkers for several more hours.
Better cancel those dinner plans
- everyone is going to be late!

ANGLE ON - SOLJAK

leaving Transit Authority HQ in a car driven by Terrell,
instantly stuck in traffic between buses, news vans, and a
sea of pedestrians. IN THE CAR: Soljak looks out at his
world in collapse. Terrell feeds Soljak even more problems:

TERRELL
She keeps calling: she’s with the
mayor and she’s looking for you
and she’s really pissed.

SOLJAK
Damn this traffic! Do something!

Soljak, frustrated, bolts OUT OF THE CAR.
79.

TERRELL
No Chief. Don’t. Don’t leave me!

Soljak hurries to a subway entrance - but someone grabs him:

MICHELLE MURPHY

Answer your phone when I call you!
The mayor will be at this new City
Hall Station of yours in 20 minutes.
Be there to meet him: 6 p.m. He
will speak to the press about im-
proved safety - the shuttle will

be his example. There will be no
discussion of missing trains. Under-
stand? And put on a clean shirt.
And I assume you found that train?

SOLJAK
I’m on my way to get it right now.

Soljak dashes down into the subway.
INT. VACUUM CAR - SUBWAY TUNNEL

Soljak has commandeered a specialized, hot-yellow, eight-ton
Vacuum Car - a futuristic-looking machine that cleans the
tracks of the subway and the only thing now running on the
new shuttle line. Its powerful overhead beams illuminate the
rails and tunnel ahead. From the wide front window it’s an
almost-magical view of the underworld of the city.

SOLJAK
(to the Vac-Car operator)
Anything special to running it?

The OPERATOR - it’s a woman - shrugs: not really.

SOLJAK (CONT'D)
Wanna let me try? I used to do
this. And today might be my last
day down here.

OPERATOR
(knows she shouldn't, but)
Take the controls.

The operator slides out of her seat and lets Soljak take over
- Soljak like a kid with a new set of toy trains. He gives
the Vac-Car some power - it hums down the track.

SOLJAK
Yeah. Nothing special - just
the best job in the world.
80.

INT. THE NEW SHUTTLE STATION

Tupelo sits on a shiny plastic bench cutting a 2-inch wide,
10-inch long strip of paper. A RUMBLE from far down the
tunnel. He tenses - a powerful beam of light washes the
station. And then it arrives, the strangest looking machine
he’s ever seen. Soljak steps out onto the platform, the
Vacuum-Car continues on. Soljak appraises Tupelo ---

SOLJAK
Substitute teacher. Magician. And
now: cutting paper dolls.
(can’t believe this)
I’m in your hands.

TUPELO
You ever hear of a Moebius Strip?

Soljak squints. Tupelo shows him the strip of paper. Sounds
like a magician:

TUPELO (CONT'D)
Two sides, right? If I make it
into a loop I have an outside
and an inside. But, if instead
of attaching the ends as a loop
I put a twist in the strip, and
then attach the ends, what we’ve
got is what’s called ---

He twists the strip of paper and attaches the opposite ends,
seals them with the tape ---

TUPELO (CONT’D)
A Moebius Strip ---

Looks like a twisted figure eight.

SOLJAK
Yeah --- and?

TUPELO
Now, if I take this marker and
draw a line down the middle of
the strip, look what happens ---

Tupelo draws a line down the length of the twisted paper
coil; as he follows the architecture of the coil the line
81.

comes back to where it started having inscribed both sides

of the strip.

Soljak takes

Sokjak grabs

TUPELO (CONT’D)
I never lifted the pen. So, we had a
strip of paper with two sides that
now has only one side. Right? So what
happened to the other side? Don’t
guess. As simple as it seems, this
is a profound mystery. You see,
when any system makes more and more
connections to other parts of itself
the connectivity of that system
increases in an exponential fashion
- in the case of the subway forming
a knot of staggering proportions.

the seemingly simple moebius from Tupelo.

SOLJAK
There were two sides. Now there’s
one side. I'll play: where’s the
other side?

TUPELO
Inside. I know that’s hard to imagine.
And by “inside” I also mean “outside.”

SOLJAK
“inside, outside” - I don’t have time
for bullshit now ---
(crunches the moebius)
That train went missing and my system
fell apart. Where’s my train? - and I
want a nuts-and-bolts answer.

TUPELO
I’m afraid there’s only one answer:
your train, with my wife, has slip-
ped into a parallel dimension.

Tupelo and slams him against the wall.

SOLJAK
A para---!!? That’s why you brought me
here!? Are you---!? You motherf---!
TUPELO

(cool as ice)
Used to be just theory for me, but
now I know it’s real.
82.

SOLJAK
What's real!?

TUPELO
The world unseen.

SOUNDS GRUMBLE, PILLARS RATTLE - a steady throb of tension.

TUPELO (CONT’D)
It was something I tried to convince
myself of, it helped me imagine the
work I was doing, helped me imagine
that my kid ---, I tried to convince
my wife of it, that there was a world
of beauty and amazement right beyond
our reach, but that only screwed
things up more. But now ---

(drags Soljak to ---)
Look at your map, your subway is a
842 mile knot of amazing topological
complexity, but now adding the shuttle
line makes it even more complex - and
the situation is now of an order so
high that I suspect the connectivity -
the properties of all the connections
in the New York Subway System - has
now become infinite. Can you imagine
the properties of an infinite network?

(off Soljak’s look)

I can’t either. But the train is no
longer in the realm of “where,” the
whole System is now without a real
“whereness,” and your new shuttle
has caused the #3 train from Brook-
lyn to jump into another dimension.

SOLJAK
Fuck You.

TUPELO
You wouldn’t be here unless you knew
something was wrong - something way
wrong that you can’t explain. Well
guess what: that kid who grabbed onto
the back of that train - she actually
saw it disappear. Now look at this ---

Tupelo starts cutting length-wise through the crunched-by-
Soljak-but-not-broken moebius strip:
83.

TUPELO (CONT’D)
Now it really gets weird, watch:
when I cut this again ---

As he makes the final cut ---
LIKE A MAGIC TRICK:

The Moebius strip suddenly snaps itself into two separate
moebius strips tied together in a knot! Huh? Soljak reacts.
So do we. (NOTE: this actually happens)

TUPELO (CONT’D)
C’mere, you need to see this ---

Tupelo holds the “Moebius Knot” up against THE WALL-SIZED
SUBWAY MAP. CAMERA MOVES IN:

THE MOEBIUS KNOT ---—

--- IS A PERFECT MATCH WITH THE “POWER SPOT” JUMBLE OF SUBWAY
LINES - INCLUDING THE SHUTTLE - ALL COILED TOGETHER IN BROOKLYN!

SOLJAK
What the hell ---!???

TUPELO
Yeah: “what the hell.” What time
did you connect the shuttle tracks
to the rest of the system?

SOLJAK
You know what time I connected it.

TUPELO
When you connected the shuttle tracks
this morning you created this. Now I
know this map is only an approximation
of the system, but the actual connect-
ions are even more complex. I got off
at Bergen Street. The train continued
but never made it to its next stop,
but it did enter this newly created
moebius knot and moved into a non-
spatial plane. It continues to draw
power from the System - you know that
- so it’s got to be somewhere ---
but it’s somewhere we can’t see.

Soljak seems ready to punch Tupelo. Tupelo stands his ground.
84.

TUPELO (CONT’D)
Six hundred years ago people weren’t
morons - look what they built, the art
they created, the cities - all these
genius people - and yet for them the
world was flat, and the earth was
the center of the universe ---

(pure energy)
---and then, suddenly, they were
totally mind-fucked - suddenly the
world was round - round! - and we
weren’t the center of existence but
one little speck at the edge of space
- and then, when the microscope was
invented, whoa! - suddenly there’s a
whole other world --- of tiny little
creatures - living inside our bodies!
And so, imagine the future, people in
touch with sounds and ideas, waves and
currents and signals we can’t fathom -
yet. ‘Cause reality itself doesn’t
change but the reality in our minds
always changes. So what the future will
know, it won’t be just this. So are
there other dimensions surrounding
us, dimensions of time and space that
fill in the gaps we can’t explain?
Yes. I believe that. Yes.

SOLJAK
It can’t be. I gave my life to this
machine. Nuts and bolts. “For every
action there’s a reaction.” That’s
how the world works. Not---.

TUPELO
Then why are you here?

Soljak tries to make the words to answer. Can’t. Tupelo
moves in close:

TUPELO (CONT'D)
What is it? I see it in your eyes.
You know something.

One long moment. Soljak turns away --- mutters.

TUPELO (CONT’D)
I didn’t hear you. What did you say?
85.

Almost a whisper:

SOLJAK
That blackened track, missing
train ---
(beat)

It's happened before.

TUPELO
(now he grabs Soljak)
What!? It’s happened before!???

SOLJAK
Maybe a year ago, three in the
morning, for a few seconds.

WE SEE QUICK-CUT MOMENTS, VISUAL FLASHES OF ---

SOLJAK (V.O.) (CONT'D)
We were testing the current in the
shuttle tunnel, no tracks yet, just
the power grid, when an F-Train
going through Rutgers Tunnel - it’s
marker light goes off, then the
light comes back on. So who cares,
right? Couple a seconds. Coulda

been a short circuit. But when the
motorman pulls in he says some crazy
shit happened - blames the conductor
- conductor also says something
weird happened - says the motorman
must have blacked out at the con-
trols - so now they start throwing
punches at each other so we follow
up: train’s fine, the signals are
fine, but the track turned black
where that train went off the board.
But no one wants to get written up
and it’s four in the morning - train
was full of drunks, so nobody thinks
about this shit - they just want to
get home. But I think about it. Then
I forget about it. Until now.

Tupelo is astonished, elated - and terrified. His theory:
true. Soljak: more frightened, more confused.

SOLJAK (CONT'D)
But why then, if the tracks did
this ---
86.

TUPELO
Simple terms: trigger a nuclear
reaction, before you get to criti-
cal mass you get smaller reactions
- that’s why that circuit test you
ran only caused that blip, but
now, with the tracks ---

SOLJAK
Then how come every train in the
system hasn’t --- how come there

aren’t 10, 20, 100 trains missing?

TUPELO
There must be an exclusion princi-
ple operating, such that only one
train at a time can occupy the
non-spatial network and ---

Soljak’s heard enough, gets out his phone, starts a call ---

SOLJAK
I’m getting a railer team down
here, we’ll disconnect a stretch
of track, that’1l break your
Moebius thing and - POOF! ---
we'll get that train back.

TUPELO
(grabs the phone away)
No! No! You can’t do that!

SOLJAK
What!? Why not?

TUPELO
The relevant non-spatial property
is derived from the shuttle line,
but now it belongs to the whole
System!

SOLJAK
In English!

TUPELO
If anything changes now, we'll
lose that train forever. If you
cut the knot ---

Tupelo tears one piece of his paper moebius --- and the knot
87.

instantly collapses into two separate tangled strands.

TUPELO (CONT’D)
---you can’t put it back together.
The System has to stay the same
until we bring back that train!

SUDDENLY a pressure in the air, a sizzle of electricity. The
hairs on their arms begin to rise. Something about to happen.
Then they hear FROM DOWN IN THE TUNNEL A DEEP RUMBLE, then a
HORN BLAST YOU CAN FEEL IN YOUR HEART. A FLASH OF SEARING
LIGHT, and then ---

A SPIFFY NEW SHUTTLE SUBWAY TRAIN -
all shiny silver, empty, clean - and real - glides through

the station. Tupelo has never seen a subway train like this.
Like a mirage. But it’s real. From Soljak: a sad laugh.

SOLJAK
My life’s work.

TUPELO
It’s running already?

SOLJAK
Special train.

TUPELO
To where?

SOLJAK

City Hall. I’m supposed to be there
- they were giving me a medal,
front page news, a nice party.

TUPELO
You should be there: friends, family.

SOLJAK
This is my family. There it goes.

Soljak watches the train disappear into the darkness. Tupelo
sees that Soljak’s cheeks are flushed, his eyes are red.

TUPELO
You gotta have someone.

SOLJAK
I gave up on that a long time ago.
(beat)
Hope you got a plan.
88.

TUPELO

We need to propel that missing
train back to where it escaped
from and trap it---

(goes to the map)
It’s living off the power from
the rails, right? So by shutting
down its power starting up here
- moving from the Bronx down to
Brooklyn, Queens to Brooklyn,
pushing north from Coney Island,
Bay Ridge and Rockaway - by cut-
ting the power grid section-by-
section we can chase it, corner
it, and ---

SOLJAK
That’s your plan? With the mayor
back in town reassuring everyone
that everything's perfectly normal?

TUPELO
We'll have to, and then we’1l
direct all that energy into Bergen
Street Station to shock our train
back into the space we inhabit -
it was shocked out, we’1ll need
to shock it back in.

SOLJAK
You want me to tell the mayor I’m
shutting down New York “because a
subway train’s in another dimen-
sion”!? They’1l put me away.

TUPELO
But we have to do it.

SOLJAK
(no good - final)
Sorry, pal. No. Can’t. If that’s
the only way, we’re both screwed.

INT. BROOKLYN HOSPITAL - PEDIATRICS - DAY

Nurse Judy treats the cuts and lacerations on Tinkerbell’s
hands, wrists, and knees. All around them children are crying
- as if they have a special sense that something profound is
in the air. Jamal, watching Tinkerbell, concern. He holds
Tupelo’s scribbled phone number, comments:
89.

JAMAL
Poor man. Lost a baby, now his old
lady is gone --- poor Professor

What-The-Hell’s-His-Name. He said
he was gonna shut down the whole

city to catch his train. They’re

never gonna let him do that.

Nurse Carla passes Jamal, growls at him:

NURSE CARLA
How'd you know I'd say “carrot”?

Nurse Judy is attending to Tinkerbell:

NURSE JUDY
This is going to hurt ---

Nurse Judy puts a wash of antiseptic on Tinkerbell palm ---

TINKERBELL
Ouch.

A SECOND NURSE gives Tinkerbell a tetanus shot ---

TINKERBELL (CONT’D)
Ouch!

A THIRD NURSE plucks a steel splinter from Tinkerbell’s knee.
Should be “ouch” --- but this time Tinkerbell does not react.
She just re-counts each hit of pain:

TINKERBELL (CONT’D)
One --- two --- three ---

Suddenly she jumps to her feet:

TINKERBELL (CONT’D)
I know how to do it!

AT THE NURSES STATION

Tinkerbell grabs the number from Jamal, pushes aside nurses,
grabs a phone, calls - Tupelo answers. Tinkerbell screeches:

TINKERBELL (CONT’D)
You don’t have to shut down the
whole city! I see it how - when
there’s a fire in a tunnel the
trains all keep running. They
keep running ‘cause it’s three
different powers down there!
90.

Jamal holds back all the nurses:

JAMAL
Let her do her thing. They’re
gonna put her in a genius museum.

INT. THE NEW STATION

Tupelo and Soljak listen to the breathless intensity pouring
out of the cell phone:

TINKERBELL (0.S.)
One’s the city electric. One’s all
the signals and lights down there.
And then there’s the train power!
You can just shut down the tracks!

TUPELO
Is she right?

SOLJAK
(realizes: )
Of course - split system, same since
1904 - every train pulls power from
the third rail - DC current, s’got
nothing to do with the city grid.
(very impressed)
Who you talking to?

ANGLE ON: TINKERBELL - IN THE HOSPITAL
jumping onto the nurses’ desk, yelling into the phone:
TINKERBELL
So if you cut the train power the
stations would still be lit, the
city’1l still be lit, but all the
trains will stop! And then you can
crash the system! Do it! Do it!

NURSE JUDY
Somebody call Security!

INT. NEW SHUTTLE STATION
Soljak to Tupelo racing up the escalator to the street.

SOLJAK
How do we explain this to people?
gl.

TUPELO
We don’t. We can’t. We’ve got to
bring it back, you and me, now.
Before anything changes! We’ll
do it, and no one on the street
will even know it happened.

SOLJAK
How long will it take?

TUPELO
30 - 45 - 60, tops. Trust me.

SOLJAK
An hour? Even a half hour? You
kidding? At rush hour?

TUPELO
Who said a half hour!? --- 30,
45 seconds! - we’re dealing

with the speed of light!
INT. HOSPITAL LOBBY - DAY

ON TINKERBELL AND JAMAL --- rushing through the hospital
lobby down into the subway entrance just outside the doors.

JAMAL
I do not want to miss this.

EXT. DOWNTOWN BROOKLYN - DAY

Tupelo and Soljak muscle through the rush hour crowd, Soljak
barking into his phone:

SOLJAK
Morrissey! This is what I need
from you ---
EXT. VAN CORTLAND TOWER - DAY

Morrissey (Soljak’s friend, the Jamaican dispatcher at the
elevated tower in The Bronx), reacts:

MORRISSEY
You want me to do what? Aw, Soljak ---

EXT. DOWNTOWN BROOKLYN - DAY

Soljak is onto his next call ---
92.

SOLJAK
It’s just a test. We’re running a
test. Yes, it’s been approved.

INT. 42ND STREET/TIMES SQUARE TOWER - DAY

Busiest station in the city. This dispatcher, a woman,
crushes a cigarette pack.

JOANNE THE DISPATCHER
Who orders a test at rush hour?
Okay, Soljak, whatever you say.
EXT. HOWARD BEACH TOWER

Seagulls perch atop a lonely near-deserted modern tower in
view of marshes and JFK Airport.

HOWARD BEACH DISPATCHER
I’m not the only one, am I? At what
time ---? 6:20?
The dispatcher looks at his clock: now it’s 6:11.
INT. WASHINGTON HEIGHTS/191ST STREET STATION - DAY

Cave-like, loud, the deepest station in the system. This
dispatcher holds his head as he takes the call from Soljak:

DEEP DISPATCHER
If it’s gotta be done it’s gotta be done.

ON THE STREET
They keep moving. Soljak keeps calling. Then, to Tupelo:
SOLJAK
Say, when you were a kid did you
ever take the subway?
TUPELO
All the time. Rode right up front.
Looking out the window. Why?

SOLJAK
What school you go to?

TUPELO
I went to private school. Why?

Soljak puts a hand on Tupelo’s shoulder.
93.

SOLJAK
Nothing. Just: “R-T,” you shoulda
been nicer to the trains.

Off Tupelo’s look, Soljak keeps rolling calls ---
INT/EXT. CONEY ISLAND/STILLWELL AVENUE TOWER - DAY

In view of Nathan's, “The Cyclone” roller coaster and the
beach. This elevated junction has multiple platforms beneath
a vaulted steel roof. A guy on the phone, SECOND IN COMMAND,
does not comprehend:

SECOND IN COMMAND
I don’t know you or what you’re
talking about but I’11 tell Bob.

SOLJAK
Just tell Bob it’s Soljak, and tell him
to cut power for two minutes at 6:20.

EXT. JAMAICA MAINTENANCE YARD - DUSK

AN OLD BRICK BUILDING looks over the vast Maintenance Yard
where subway cars return at the end of their runs to be
washed, patched, and then sent out again.

IN THE RED BRICK BUILDING

A small woman, MS. JOHNSON, stands in front of a big panel
with 86 levers, her hands in motion like an orchestra
conductor, she walks back and forth operating the switches
that pump trains into the system. Someone hands her a phone:

MS. JOHNSON
(as she works the levers)
Why Mister Soljak, how is that big
party they got going for you today?
They must have lost my invitation.

ON THE STREET - DOWNTOWN BROOKLYN - DAY
Soljak purrs into the phone for this call:
SOLJAK
Why Ms. Johnson, so good to hear
your voice. I have a tiny little
favor to ask ---

IN THE RED BRICK BUILDING

The little woman stiffens:
94.

MS. JOHNSON
What are you drinking at that
party? You want me to stop
sending out trains?

ON SOLJAK
Like bitter sugar:

SOLJAK
Just for one little minute. And
--- I’m missing the party too.

INT. THE NEW CITY HALL SHUTTLE STATION, MANHATTAN - DAY

SITE OF THE BIG PARTY: balloons, bartenders serving egg creams,
that damn “New York New York” song playing over and over again
and a giant cake in the shape of a new shuttle train. The MAYOR,
at a podium with shuttle logo, makes a speech:

MAYOR

On a day when our coordinated
efforts show that despite adver-
sity there is no problem we can’t
tackle, it’s my pleasure to cele-
brate progress. This auspicious
moment for the people of New York
could never have happened without
a team. There was the Governor ---

APPLAUSE. THE GOVERNOR smiles. As the mayor next introduces
DIGNITARIES, THE CAMERA SWEEPS PAST the balloons, band, PARIS
HILTON, reporters and cake, to FIND: TERRELL and MICHELLE.

TERRELL
You gotta wait for him. He built
this whole thing, he’s been wait-
ing his whole life for this!

MICHELLE MURPHY
Your boss has ruined my day.

TERRELL
But this is his party.

The shiny new shuttle train eases into the station. Cheers
and applause. The Mayor smiles proudly, jokes:

MAYOR
I am seeing something and I am
saying something: Wow!
95.

MICHELLE MURPHY
(to Terrell)
He’s late. You see these reporters,
those photographers? We are not go-
ing to wait. By the way ---

Now beside them: Bob the Reporter, who finishes her question:

BOB THE REPORTER
You ever find that train?

MICHELLE MURPHY
Of course they found it. That was
like ten hours ago. Old news.

BOB THE REPORTER
Where was it?

As Terrell stalls, The Mayor wraps up his speech:

MAYOR

--- at last tying together The
Bronx, Manhattan, Brooklyn and
Queens - sorry Staten Island,
you're next, be patient.

(that gets a laugh)
And now for this medal, for the
one person who has been with
this project from the start ---

The Mayor looks to Michelle: who do I give this to? She
shrugs: he’s not here. So ---

MAYOR (CONT'D)

This special city medal goes to the
one person without whom there would
be no shuttle --- and certainly no
party today. Let’s all salute ---

(he’s got to give it

to someone---)
Michelle Murphy!

FLASH POPS as a proud Michelle goes to the podium to accept
Soljak’s medal as her own. PICTURES! PICTURES! PICTURES!

MAYOR (CONT'D)
Let’s all ride the shuttle!

The mayor, governor, senators, reporters and photographers,
and of course Michelle, all press into the train.
96.

TERRELL
No! You gotta wait for Soljak---

But Terrell is ignored as generators and compressors fire up.

CONDUCTOR
Stand clear of the closing doors.

A ding-dong chime and the doors close. There’s a triumphant
blow of the train’s horn ---

CONDUCTOR (CONT ’D)
Next stop - Brooklyn!

LOUD CHEERS from within the train as the shuttle train pulls out
of the station, disappearing around a curve and leaving Terrell
alone on the platform surrounded by balloons and cake.

EXT. BROOKLYN STREETS - SUNSET

A dirt-red setting sun fights with dark rain clouds. Distant
thunder. Tupelo and Soljak are pushing their way through the
crowded, chaotic streets. It’s a few blocks to DeKalb Station:
master control for Brooklyn. Tupelo splits off to the right.

SOLJAK
Where you think you’re going?

TUPELO
Gotta catch a train at Bergen Street.

SOLJAK
Whoa! No. That station’s too dangerous.
I shut it down. You can’t go there.

TUPELO
(keeps moving)
My wife --- I’ve got to.

SOLJAK
(chases him, holds him)
You can’t! I’m pumping the energy
of this whole system into that one
stretch - if we do get it back ---
maybe you don’t wanna be there.

TUPELO
I have to be there. I should have
been on that train, should have
stayed on it. If I had - my weight,
mass - maybe it would have been
different - but I gotta be there
now. No matter what. With her.
97.

SOLJAK
But those people - after twelve
hours, what’s ---?

TUPELO

It could be over for them. The
stress of the passage - or maybe
they’re or in some kind of suspend-
ed time - everything that ever
happened in that tunnel could be
wrapped around like a loop - or
maybe it’s pure terror or ---

SOLJAK
Sometimes when I don’t know an
answer you know what I say? -
“I don’t know.” What’s her name?
TUPELO
My wife? “Renee.” And yeah: I
know what it means.

SOLJAK
Good luck.

Tupelo dashes down into the Atlantic Avenue Station.
INT. ATLANTIC AVENUE SUBWAY STATION - NIGHT

Tupelo rushes towards the end of the platform. He ignores
DANGER! DO NOT ENTER! - climbs over the railing.

INT. ATLANTIC-BERGEN STREET SUBWAY TUNNEL - NIGHT

Tupelo runs along the dark narrow ledge towards the glowing
lights of the Bergen Street Station - a quarter mile away.

INT. DEKALB AVENUE COMMAND ROOM - NIGHT
Soljak stands at the main board, barks into a headset:

SOLJAK
Okay, Morrissey. Do it.

INT. VAN CORTLAND TOWER, BRONX - NIGHT
Morrissey throws a switch.
INT. CONVERSION SUBSTATION - BRONX - NIGHT

A substation feeding power to the rails. Its motors shut down.
98.

EXT. ELEVATED TRACKS, THE BRONX - NIGHT

Power shuts down along this sector of track - as all trains
stop WE SEE A FLASH OF SPARKS AND SMOKE and then a SHIMMER
OF ELECTRICITY RETREATING BACK TOWARDS MANHATTAN.

INT. ATLANTIC-BERGEN TUNNEL - NIGHT

Tupelo runs hard along the wall ledge - but the ledge stops a
hundred yards short of Bergen Street Station. He climbs over
the safety railing, drops down into the track bed, runs
towards the lights at the end of the tunnel.

EXT. 145TH STREET - HARLEM - NIGHT

A SNAKE OF SPARKS FLASHES along the path of the elevated
track then WHOOSHES down into THE BROADWAY IRT TUNNEL.

INT. BROADWAY IRT TUNNEL - NIGHT

A SIZZLE OF BLUE-SPARKING DC CURRENT and A POWERFUL WIND
SWEEPS PAST the 116th Street/Columbia University station ---

INT. BROADWAY IRT RELAY ROOM

The relays are clicking-smoking like crazy, but there’s no
visible trains running here! - only that FLASH OF ENERGY.

CLOSE SHOTS - DIFFERENT HANDS CLOSING SWITCHES

Little red lights on control boards go dark.

EXT. SHEA STADIUM STATION, QUEENS - NIGHT

Manhattan skyline in the distance. Passengers waiting on the
elevated platform see the tracks that curve past Shea Stadium
then dip down into the Corona Subway Tunnel. A train heads
for the station from the other direction. Grinds to a halt
when the power is cut. Suddenly:

THE ENTIRE ELEVATED PLATFORM BEGINS TO SHAKE -

--- RAILS VIBRATING and sending out A BASS NOTE SO DEEP it
causes the people on the platform to gasp for air as ---

A CRACKLE OF LIGHTNING ---

--- EXPLODES out from the Corona Tunnel - shoots towards Shea
Stadium Station and the now-stalled train - then SCREECHES to
a STOP as if hitting an invisible wall and instantly ROCKETS
back towards Manhattan.
99.

INT. ATLANTIC-BERGEN STREET TUNNEL, BROOKLYN - NIGHT

Tupelo, running towards the eerie glow of Bergen Street
Station - can FEEL the POWER coursing through the system -
overhead pipes THROBBING, tracks GROANING and RATTLING.

INT. SUBWAY TUNNELS THROUGHOUT THE CITY ---
WE FOLLOW THE BLUE-SPARKING, SCREECHING, SEARING-HOT CURRENT --—

--- SLAMMING US BACK INTO OUR SEATS as it races 10-20-30
miles in an instant - RICOCHETING BACK FROM INVISIBLE WALLS
(where the power’s been cut) - trying every way to escape ---

SPARKS AND WIND WHIPPING PAST 468 STATIONS -

--- in the span of a few seconds - from SOUTH FERRY at the
south tip of Manhattan up to PELHAM BAY in the Bronx, out
to QUEENS PLAZA, then blasting back through TIMES SQUARE ---

INT. DEKALB AVENUE CONTROL ROOM, BROOKLYN - NIGHT

Soljak watches the big board that shows the entire New York
City Subway System - red lights are now dark in the Bronx,
Queens, and TURNING OFF LIKE A DESCENDING CURTAIN in Manhat-
tan --- THE LIGHTS ON THE BOARD GOING DARK IN SOUTHEAST
BROOKLYN - all that remains glowing now is

THE MOEBIUS KNOT

of the interlocked subways lines that all converge in
Brooklyn - and one slim line of lights that trails south to
Coney Island. Soljak points to that still-glowing line:

SOLJAK
What the - shut down Coney Island!

INT. THE KNOT OF SUBWAY TUNNELS UNDER DOWNTOWN BROOKLYN

The BLUE ARC OF FLAME that carries THE ENERGY STORM is now like
A THRILL RIDE WHIPPING AROUND THE MOEBIUS KNOT/POWER SPOT as it
tries to find its way out of THE TWISTING MAZE OF SUBWAY TUBES
AND TUNNELS, every escape route closing, directing ALL THE
POWER OF THE ENTIRE SYSTEM TOWARDS ---

INT. BERGEN STREET STATION - NIGHT
Deserted. Gates locked. Tupelo reaches the pit in front of

the platform, reaches to a ladder, HEARS THE ONCOMING ROAR
OF THE PULSING ENERGY STORM and ---
100.

TUPELO IS HIT WITH A WALL OF POWER AND WIND
that knocks him down onto the tracks -
AT THE SAME SPOT HE FELL IN THE MORNING ---

--- debris and muck flying - again he loses his glasses ---
the power blasts past him ---

TUPELO
Renee---!1!!

THE POWER PASSES THROUGH THE STATION

and disappears into the southbound darkness. Tupelo reacts:
No Renee. No train. Alone between the vibrating tracks he
pounds the wooden ties with his fists - emotional agony:
his plan failed - the train with car #8686 did not return.
INT. DEKALB CONTROL TOWER - NIGHT

All lights are dark on the map of the city - except for
Bergen Street and that string of lights south to Coney
Island. Soljak smacks the board.

SOLJAK
What the hell’s going on!?

ENGINEER
They won’t shut it down at Coney --
- the special train’s out there,
the mayor’s train.

SOLJAK
It’s not HIS train, it’s MINE!

Soljak rips the metal cover off a circuit control board,
reaches in and tears out a handful of wires.

EXT. CONEY ISLAND ELEVATED TRACKS ---

The electrified 3rd rail goes dead.

INT. THE NEW SHUTTLE TRAIN - NIGHT

The train stops with a jolt. People tumble, knocking over the
party food and drink trays. The generator stops. The mayor:

huh? - lights go out, everyone groans, then we hear ---

MAYOR
Michelle! !!!

Outside the window of the now-dark special subway shuttle the
101.

only thing still running on rails in Coney Island is
EXT. THE CYCLONE ROLLER COASTER - NIGHT

People screaming, arms in the air, as they shoot down and
around the old wooden coaster’s gravity-controlled tracks.

EXT. CONEY ISLAND ELEVATED SUBWAY TRACKS - NIGHT

THE BOLT OF LIGHTNING ROARS TOWARDS CONEY ISLAND AND THE
MAYOR’S NOW-DARK SHUTTLE TRAIN, STOPS INCHES FROM SLAMMING

INTO THE SHUTTLE TRAIN, INSTANTLY REVERSES and---

SCREECHES BACK TOWARDS BERGEN STREET

along the ELEVATED ROUTE, TEARING A WAVE OF SPIKES OUT OF THE
TRACKS, SPIKES RAINING DOWN ONTO THE STREETS BELOW as THE STORM
OF POWER arcs down into the subway tunnel under Prospect Park...
«+. the park now lit by a PHOSPHORESCENT GLOW as ---

INT. BERGEN STREET STATION - NIGHT

Tupelo sees the ONCOMING STORM-WAVE OF POWER BLASTING RIGHT
AT HIM - the rails white-hot, the wind and pressure ---

DRAWING POWER FROM THE ENTIRE GRID OF THE SUBWAY SYSTEM
shaking loose pipes and spikes and wires and now Tupelo is
AT THE CENTER OF A HURRICANE -
force and power swirling around him faster and faster and
noise ROARING, Tupelo being cut by the sizzling swirling
steel dust, wires igniting and steam pipes bursting and
EVERYTHING LOUDER AND LOUDER AND THEN ---
SILENCE --- and then:
THERE IS A GENTLE ROCKING SOUND
CLOSE UP - SUBWAY AD:

- WHO WILL BE MISS SUBWAYS? -
INT. SUBWAY CAR - MOVING
Tupelo, is inside subway car 8686 holding onto the pole for
balance, looking up at the old SUBWAY BEAUTY CONTEST POSTER.
He hears the SCREECH of wheels.

Then he sees:
102.

A PREP SCHOOL KID

back turned to him, at the front --- carving initials into
the door: R-T

TUPELO TRIES TO MOVE - HE CAN’T - HE LOOKS OUT THE WINDOWS

Running parallel on a parallel track is a different subway
train - A 1940'S-STYLE TRAIN with Casablanca-type ceiling
fans, filled with people dressed in 1940’s style ---

TUPELO IS MOVING THROUGH SPACE AND TIME -

The parallel subway train edges sideways now, MOVING CLOSER
AND CLOSER to the train Tupelo is riding in - Tupelo GRIPS
the pole, BRACES for a collision but instead ---

THE TWO TRAINS SOFTY CONVERGE ---
--- becoming one overlapped train in overlapped dimensions
TUPELO IS NOW INSIDE BOTH TRAINS ---

--- folded into each other on A TRIP THROUGH FOUR-DIMENSIONAL
SPACE WHERE TIME AND SURFACE WARP AND WRAP through each other
as if liquids mixing - a stewing cauldron of images - the
famous “WHO WILL BE MISS SUBWAY?” ads floating through air -—
people long since gone shifting in and out of focus as

THE TRAIN ITSELF CHANGES ---

---its windows now in the shape of portholes, its color
scheme an art deco red and grey, morphing in and out of every
style of train that has ever run on these tracks - a WOODEN
CAR FROM 1904 - Tupelo among men in straw hats - NOW IT’S THE
60'S - bellbottoms, big Afros - the train plastered with
graffiti - NOW THE TRAIN IS PACKED WITH PASSENGERS going to
Coney Island in the 1920’s - all these overlaps fading as

THE TRAIN ITSELF STRETCHES AND BECOMES A TUNNEL ---
--- AN ELONGATED TUBE GROWING LONGER AND LONGER ---

AND THEN CURLING INTO A PRETZEL-SHAPED MOEBIUS STRIP: THE
SHAPE OF THE UNIVERSE ---

--- the train turning in on itself without tearing, turning
inside out --- without upsetting the point of reference
occupied by Richard Tupelo who sees:

RENEE

Sitting at the end of the train---
103.

--- AS THEY DETOUR THROUGH FOUR-DIMENSIONAL SPACE,

Renee tranquil amidst the sounds of STORMS and EXPLOSIONS and
STEEL WHEELS SCREECHING and SUBWAY DRUMMERS and now ---

RENEE IS HOLDING AN INFANT WRAPPED IN A BLANKET ---
Tupelo moves to her. Touches her cheek. Renee looks up:

RENEE
Don’t be afraid.

--- they look down together at the cooing, giggling child
observing this wonderful show of light, shape and color. No
longer are there metal edges, plastic veneer, aluminum poles
and vents dripping condensation, INSTEAD ---

THE INFANT SEES:

EXTRAORDINARY PATTERNS and SPECTRUMS of LIQUID CRYSTAL LIGHTS
and COLORS UNIMAGINABLE ---

--- with SPIRALLING PATTERNS of SNOW-FLAKE FRACTALS and crest-
ing WAVE FORMS in a sea of COMETARY KNOTS (the tadpole-like
particle residue of dying stars) and CLOUDS OF ATOMS ---

--- all wrapped in a MICROWAVE-SUPERNOVA GLOW of more-and-more
complex MOEBIUS STRIPS --- a primal vision of beauty and
sensual reality, the world unseen.

RENEE REACHES OUT TO TUPELO,
takes his hand:

RENEE (CONT'D)
You were right, Richard. She lived
- she saw the world, this world,
the world we’ve forgotten, and she
saw it and had a wonderful little
life, a beautiful life, with the
most beautiful visions and experi-
ences - she had all that - and all
our love --- and she lived.

Tupelo touches the baby, and now, with Renee smiling, he
starts to cry --- has held in so much, now his release ---

TUPELO
I miss her so much. I miss us.
104.

RENEE
I know Richard. But we did good.
She was happy. She lived.
He leans down to kiss her ---
THEIR LIPS MEET

---one long beautiful kiss - one long unimaginable expression
of love - which alters space and time --- and now:

RENEE IS STANDING BESIDE HIM,

No child, the two of them together, same spot they were in
when they argued on the train in the morning -

NOW THEY ARE KISSING,

a kiss that seems to awaken them both from a spell of sadness
--- that’s all good, but suddenly

THE TRAIN IS NO LONGER FLOATING THROUGH THE FOURTH DIMENSION
--- instead it is bucking and rocking and all the passengers
from this morning are again surrounding them - devolving
instantly into panic mode: THEY ARE TRAPPED IN A SUBWAY CAR
AND SOMETHING IS WRONG.

WINDOWS SHATTER -—

reflecting, refracting the action into thousands of mirror-
images - Renee looks at Tupelo - what is this? Tupelo’s plan
has worked - but it ain’t pretty:

TUPELO
We’re trying to get back home ---

IN CAR #8686

Surfaces are hard again, passengers being thrown from side to
side as THE TRAIN BREAKS THROUGH INTO OUR SPACE AND TIME and
now #8686 is at the head of

A RUNAWAY TRAIN

WHEELS SCREECHING, SPIKES FLYING, SPARKS IGNITING, over-speed
detectors TEARING out of the tracks ---

IN THE TRAIN

the operator’s door slams open - no one’s inside --- Tupelo
leaps to the booth, reaches for the brake ---
105.

IT GOES SOFT IN HIS HAND ---

--- the train controls are still not back in our world ---
Tupelo is thrown out of the booth to the ground.

HE GRIPS THE HANDLE OF THE FRONT DOOR,

pulls himself up, finds himself eye-to-eye with those old
initials: RT - now angrily glowing. He whispers:

TUPELO
Sorry.

The angry glow fires stronger, then fades - Tupelo forgiven.
He again launches himself into the control booth, pulls back
the throttle and now ---

THE FRICTION BRAKES ENGAGE, THE TRAIN SCREECHING into

BERGEN STREET STATION ---

--- now CAUGHT IN A TORNADO OF ENERGY - METAL SIGNS TEARING
OFF WALLS, COMPRESSED AIR AND WATER PIPES SHATTERING, WHIPPING
THE STATION WITH ICY RAIN ---

IN THE TRAIN

Tupelo turns the key-switch to open all the doors, shouting:

TUPELO
Everybody out. Get out - Now!

WATER MAINS ABOVE THE TRACKS - EXPLODING! ---

--- exit gates now open, passengers rush for the stairs -
strangers helping strangers, Tupelo and Renee carrying
children, helping old people, as ---

A FLOOD OF WATER

Crashes in from ruptured water tunnels - TUPELO AND RENEE
RUSHING UPSTAIRS TO THE STREET look back downstairs to see:

CAR #8686 ---

GROANING AND GASPING AND SCREECHING as it DROWNS in the flood
- sharing the sad fate of its fellow subway cars that were
dumped this morning in the Atlantic. TUPELO SEES: GLOWING
through the dark water, THE FADING INITIALS --- “RT”

EXT. BERGEN STREET - NIGHT

Rescued, disoriented passengers see the street signs:
106.

PASSENGERS
What’s going on!!!? --- We just
left Bergen Street!!!

COPS, EMS, FIREMEN arrive, and there’s ---

SOLJAK - with Tinkerbell and Jamal. Tinkerbell hugs Tupelo,
Jamal punching his arm.

JAMAL
Mister Unreal. You did it.

SOLJAK
This your wife? Hello Renee. So
Tupelo, you brought back my train!

TUPELO
Yeah, it’s back, but we need to cut
the tracks somewhere - now! - break

the loop before it happens again.

SOLJAK
We had to wait until you got back,
right? Now that you’re back ---

INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL UNDER CONSTRUCTION - NIGHT

Same tunnel where the shuttle tracks were first connected. A
SHOWER OF SPARKS as a WELDER begins to dis-connect the steel
rails. The contractor moans to Terrell:

CONTRACTOR
I don’t get you people. The morn-
ing he’s barking at me to finish
the job now he’s barking at me
to take it apart!?

TERRELL
He gives the orders. Not me.

INT. MAYOR’S SPECIAL SHUTTLE TRAIN - NIGHT

Stalled at Coney Island, lights off, dignitaries howling,
and Michelle Murphy screaming into her cell phone:

MICHELLE MURPHY
I don’t care what he said! I give
the orders: Turn on the power for
this train! Do it!
EXT. CONEY ISLAND/STILLWELL AVENUE TOWER - NIGHT

A hand moves a switch, overrides the main circuit and a half-
107.

mile away the mayor’s special shuttle train lights up and
starts moving.

INT. THE SUBWAY TUNNEL UNDER CONSTRUCTION - NIGHT

A final blast of SPARKS. A section of shuttle tracks is
separated. The Moebius Knot is cut.

EXT. BERGEN STREET - NIGHT
SIRENS, CHAOS, CROWDS. Renee takes Tinkerbell’s bandaged hands.

RENEE
I was worried for you.

TINKERBELL
And I was worried about you.

Tupelo first now sees that Tinkerbell and Jamal are with
Soljak - the cops want them, but one look from Soljak and
the cops keep their distance. Soljak, impressed by
Tinkerbell, to Tupelo:

SOLJAK
Kid knows more about the subway
than I do. Where’d you find her?
And this other one - asks me to
name a vegetable. I say “cabbage”
and he says “fuck you.” What's
that about?

Tupelo shrugs, innocent - goes to Renee and Tinkerbell who
are looking down into the flooding subway.

TUPELO
No one’s going to believe this.
TINKERBELL
Except us.
RENEE
And me.
SOLJAK

And you’re all gonna keep quiet
about it. It was a water main

that busted, train got diverted,
and now it’s here. End of story.

JAMAL
Who’s gonna believe that?
108.

SOLJAK
Okay then, I’1l say a train got
lost in the 4th dimension.

TUPELO
Maybe we'd better stick with “the
busted water main” version. But you
did cut the line somewhere, right?

SOLJAK
Yes, Master. The knot’s broken.
Take your wife and go home. I’11
keep an eye on these two.

Tupelo and Renee hug the kids goodbye.

RENEE
Call me.

TUPELO
Stay out of trouble.

JAMAL
You stay out of trouble. You’re
the crazy one.
(to Soljak)
Let’s try it again - what’s 2+2?

Soljak motions to Renee and Tupelo: go.
ANGLE ON - TERRELL - ON THE STREET, IN THE CROWD

Pushing through rescue workers, cops, reporters. Finally he
finds Soljak. Soljak raises a hand: stop.

SOLJAK

No Terrell. Please. Every time you
open your mouth it’s bad news. So
please ---

(with Tinkerbell and Jamal)
I made some new friends. Bother
someone else. Call Michelle. I'm
retired, effective now. I’m done
here. I’m leaving. I quit.

TERRELL
(needs to speak)
Chief, the special train, with
Michelle and everyone and the mayor
- someone musta turned the power
back on before we broke the link,
but - now that train’s missing!
109.

Soljak growls. Soljak can’t leave. He’s part of the loop.
EXT. ON THE STREET - TWO BLOCKS AWAY - NIGHT

Beyond the crowd. Tupelo and Renee walking. City lights and
stars above sparkling.

RENEE
Let’s start our life together
all over. That okay?
It’s all Tupelo has ever wanted to hear ---

TUPELO’S VOICE
That’s okay with me.

--- life as an unending Moebius Strip. Tupelo and Renee, arms
around each other, draw closer together - like interlocking
spirals - and as they rejoin the world that we can see ---

TUPELO TAKES OFF HIS GLASSES (the opposite of how our story
began), and THROUGH HIS EYES THE SCREEN BECOMES:

A SWIRL OF STRANGE IMAGES
AS IF WE'RE IN THE VORTEX OF AN EXPLODING QUASAR IN DEEP SPACE
SPLASHES OF BEAUTIFUL SHAPES AND BREATHTAKING COLORS
OVERLAPPING AND FOLDING INTO EACH OTHER---
--- a vision of how light and reality might really be.
Then, amidst the sounds of the city, we hear ---

- Tupelo! -

--- and at the faint GROWL and SCREECH of a subway train
somewhere beneath the city streets, we ---

FADE OUT TO:

THE END
